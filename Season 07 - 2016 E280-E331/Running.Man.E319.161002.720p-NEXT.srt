1
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,670
Previously on Running Man.

2
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:09,352
I'll choose this since it's been a while.

3
00:00:09,352 --> 00:00:12,982
(I, James Bond, have been waiting for this moment.)

4
00:00:12,982 --> 00:00:16,152
(Operation: Scene-stealer)

5
00:00:16,152 --> 00:00:18,752
(Steal a shoe from the members.)

6
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:21,922
(Target 1: Lee Kwang Soo)

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,222
(Deceive the members completely and steal a shoe from them.)

8
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:26,382
How should I take it?

9
00:00:28,322 --> 00:00:30,882
(Operation: Tracing Kwang Soo's foot)

10
00:00:31,022 --> 00:00:32,122
Please let me do it.

11
00:00:33,852 --> 00:00:35,682
Is it so difficult to put your foot on this?

12
00:00:35,682 --> 00:00:37,582
(Footprint is just an excuse.)

13
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:40,082
(Stealing your shoe is my real goal.)

14
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,252
Hold on.

15
00:00:42,022 --> 00:00:43,122
Catch him.

16
00:00:43,552 --> 00:00:44,752
He's a thief.

17
00:00:45,982 --> 00:00:47,782
What's this?

18
00:00:47,852 --> 00:00:50,352
(First mission: Stealing Kwang Soo's shoe was a piece of cake.)

19
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,382
(Target 2: Song Ji Hyo)

20
00:00:55,352 --> 00:00:57,622
(Operation: Secretly, greatly)

21
00:00:58,982 --> 00:01:03,752
(While they are spacing out...)

22
00:01:03,752 --> 00:01:08,452
(And from the weakest...)

23
00:01:08,722 --> 00:01:11,822
(He successfully obtained members' shoes.)

24
00:01:11,852 --> 00:01:14,882
(However,)

25
00:01:14,882 --> 00:01:21,722
(Jae Seok's identity is released to the members one by one.)

26
00:01:21,822 --> 00:01:25,222
(And he faces the strongest enemy.)

27
00:01:25,222 --> 00:01:26,922
(Kim Jong Kook)

28
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:28,852
I'm on the run now.

29
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:37,322
(The members are chasing after him.)

30
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:40,852
Hey, Sleepy.

31
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:46,222
(Avoiding the members, he needs to steal Jong Kook's shoe.)

32
00:01:46,222 --> 00:01:47,852
I have to do my mission as Scene-stealer.

33
00:01:48,682 --> 00:01:51,452
(How would he manage to go through this crisis?)

34
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:55,622
It said we should watch out for the Scene-stealer.

35
00:01:55,622 --> 00:01:56,782
Why?

36
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:03,752
Hence the name, Scene-stealer. Are you supposed to do something?

37
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,422
Not really. I'm supposed to...

38
00:02:06,422 --> 00:02:09,882
take 10 percent of your time on the video.

39
00:02:09,882 --> 00:02:11,592
- It'll be mine. - 10 percent?

40
00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:13,322
Then you should work out with us.

41
00:02:13,422 --> 00:02:15,182
(What?)

42
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:16,222
(He's now forced to work out.)

43
00:02:16,222 --> 00:02:17,422
- Come on. - No, I don't want to...

44
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:19,382
- You must work out. - No, I can't work out.

45
00:02:19,382 --> 00:02:20,522
I've come to the wrong place.

46
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:22,122
Really. Jong Kook.

47
00:02:22,182 --> 00:02:23,352
- Let's go. - Let's go.

48
00:02:23,452 --> 00:02:24,452
- You can do this. - Just follow me.

49
00:02:24,552 --> 00:02:26,222
You don't need anything to work out.

50
00:02:26,222 --> 00:02:28,092
- All right. Can I use the restroom? - No.

51
00:02:28,092 --> 00:02:29,652
- I really need to go. - No way.

52
00:02:29,652 --> 00:02:31,152
- Stop lying. - It's an emergency.

53
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:32,382
- Come on. Don't do this. - I'll be right back.

54
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:33,782
Just let me use the restroom.

55
00:02:33,782 --> 00:02:35,052
- Now, let's do some squats. - Let me use the restroom.

56
00:02:35,052 --> 00:02:36,952
- Let's start with squats. - I need to use the restroom.

57
00:02:36,952 --> 00:02:39,422
- I'll be right back. - Move your hips backwards.

58
00:02:39,422 --> 00:02:40,722
- Your hips... - That hurts.

59
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,382
Goodness. I nearly wet my pants.

60
00:02:43,382 --> 00:02:45,282
- That was really close. - I told you to pull your hips.

61
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:46,282
I'm now...

62
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:47,822
- Come on. - I really need to use the restroom.

63
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:49,522
- I really need to go. - Are you sure?

64
00:02:49,522 --> 00:02:51,782
- Yes, I'll be back. - I think you're trying to run away.

65
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:53,522
He's acting strange.

66
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:55,882
What's he up to? What is the Scene-stealer?

67
00:02:57,352 --> 00:02:58,722
(Jong Kook is very suspicious of him.)

68
00:02:59,382 --> 00:03:00,982
What should I do now?

69
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:02,152
It was just as I thought.

70
00:03:02,152 --> 00:03:03,352
(He's thinking of a strategy.)

71
00:03:03,352 --> 00:03:04,852
Oh, dear. If so...

72
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:10,052
What should I do? I can't stay here for long.

73
00:03:11,752 --> 00:03:14,622
I don't think he can take up 10 percent of our time.

74
00:03:14,622 --> 00:03:15,752
(He's acting strange.)

75
00:03:15,752 --> 00:03:17,022
It's 10 percent of 3 minutes.

76
00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:18,652
Ji Sun, come here.

77
00:03:18,652 --> 00:03:20,352
(Ji Sun, come this way.)

78
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:22,952
(Jae Seok approaches Jong Kook's stylist.)

79
00:03:23,082 --> 00:03:24,152
Ji Sun.

80
00:03:24,152 --> 00:03:26,152
(Me?)

81
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:28,622
- Please help me for once. - How?

82
00:03:29,422 --> 00:03:31,352
Can you change Jong Kook's shoes?

83
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:33,122
Why?

84
00:03:33,622 --> 00:03:35,082
Don't tell anyone.

85
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,752
I need to steal a shoe from him.

86
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:40,982
(Please help me.)

87
00:03:41,852 --> 00:03:44,182
I'll be outside. Tell him that I left.

88
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,252
- You know what I mean. - Okay.

89
00:03:45,252 --> 00:03:47,582
Please bring his shoe outside and give him any reason.

90
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:48,722
- All right. - You can do this for me, right?

91
00:03:49,322 --> 00:03:50,482
Please.

92
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:52,852
(Secretly, obsequiously)

93
00:03:52,852 --> 00:03:54,582
If he only needs 18 seconds, I think we can make it happen.

94
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:56,322
- I give up. - What?

95
00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:57,782
- I give up. - Why?

96
00:03:57,782 --> 00:03:59,322
- I'm leaving. - Why? Where are you going?

97
00:03:59,722 --> 00:04:00,882
- Where are you going? - See you later.

98
00:04:01,382 --> 00:04:02,582
He's strange.

99
00:04:02,582 --> 00:04:04,852
What's so strange? Can't I leave?

100
00:04:05,252 --> 00:04:07,382
Our mission is easy. He's really weird.

101
00:04:07,382 --> 00:04:09,452
I think he's up to something.

102
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:10,952
- It's very suspicious. - I know.

103
00:04:11,022 --> 00:04:12,552
- Even you think he's weird, right? - Right.

104
00:04:14,182 --> 00:04:15,682
It's all up to Ji Sun.

105
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:17,022
(Ji Sun, today's mission is all up to you.)

106
00:04:18,482 --> 00:04:21,982
(Ji Sun initiated the operation.)

107
00:04:24,252 --> 00:04:25,722
Can I go? Can I go home, now?

108
00:04:25,722 --> 00:04:26,822
(Everybody is busy after the mission.)

109
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:28,082
- Can I go home, now? - Yes, you can.

110
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:29,752
- I'm leaving. - Good job, Sleepy.

111
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:31,822
- You were impressive today. - All right.

112
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:34,982
- Bye. - Thanks for your hard work.

113
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:37,452
(Ji Sun is on the move.)

114
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:38,552
(Let's change your shoes.)

115
00:04:38,552 --> 00:04:39,722
Why?

116
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:46,252
(Will she successfully finish her special mission?)

117
00:04:47,282 --> 00:04:49,052
(Jae Seok is waiting anxiously.)

118
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:50,182
Goodness.

119
00:04:51,252 --> 00:04:52,752
This is nerve-racking.

120
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:59,922
(Will he manage to steal Jong Kook's shoe?)

121
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:03,982
(Goodness)

122
00:05:08,322 --> 00:05:10,022
(It's a success.)

123
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:13,222
I'll buy you a nice dinner. Thank you, Ji Sun.

124
00:05:13,722 --> 00:05:14,892
Ji Sun, how did you manage to do it?

125
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:17,852
I told him he needs to wear another pair of shoes.

126
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:22,552
Ji Sun, I'll buy you a nice dinner. Thank you so much.

127
00:05:22,552 --> 00:05:24,082
Thank you, Ji Sun.

128
00:05:24,122 --> 00:05:25,322
I think I'm in trouble.

129
00:05:25,522 --> 00:05:26,652
Stay away from him for a while.

130
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:28,952
Tell your boss and...

131
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:31,222
go somewhere else.

132
00:05:31,382 --> 00:05:32,652
Ji Sun, dinner is on me.

133
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:33,982
Thank you, Ji Sun.

134
00:05:33,982 --> 00:05:37,082
(A perfect strategy gave him a victory.)

135
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:39,152
Goodness. What a great success.

136
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,352
I knew it. There must be something.

137
00:05:43,882 --> 00:05:44,952
What?

138
00:05:44,952 --> 00:05:46,552
(Catch James Bond, the Scene-stealer)

139
00:05:46,552 --> 00:05:48,452
"Catch James Bond, the Scene-stealer."

140
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:53,252
"Eliminate James Bond who steals your shoe and your number of views."

141
00:05:53,622 --> 00:05:54,652
My shoes?

142
00:05:56,822 --> 00:06:00,752
(The shoes that he carelessly took off for his stylist.)

143
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:08,222
(You mean that was...)

144
00:06:08,422 --> 00:06:11,182
How can he steal my shoe like that?

145
00:06:11,352 --> 00:06:12,682
He should at least take it in person.

146
00:06:13,052 --> 00:06:14,722
Did he do that to other members, too?

147
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:17,282
There must be a reason. What was your reason?

148
00:06:17,282 --> 00:06:18,622
Come here.

149
00:06:18,622 --> 00:06:20,152
(Ji Sun, come here.)

150
00:06:20,152 --> 00:06:21,382
Come here.

151
00:06:21,722 --> 00:06:24,782
You must have your own reason. Come here.

152
00:06:24,782 --> 00:06:26,122
What was your reason?

153
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:28,122
What was that?

154
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,052
Tell me your reason.

155
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:32,122
(Are you a spy?)

156
00:06:32,122 --> 00:06:33,152
He was begging for help.

157
00:06:33,982 --> 00:06:35,352
Do you help everyone who begs you?

158
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:37,552
I didn't know what he was up to.

159
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,822
How can you do this to me? You're unbelievable.

160
00:06:40,852 --> 00:06:42,522
This is impossible.

161
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:44,582
I'm going to get him.

162
00:06:44,582 --> 00:06:48,822
(Angry Jong Kook starts to chase Jae Seok.)

163
00:06:48,822 --> 00:06:51,752
Let's go. Now that you've all worked out,

164
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:54,952
- I feel good. - let's show them the results.

165
00:06:57,152 --> 00:06:58,422
(Jong Kook)

166
00:06:59,322 --> 00:07:00,352
(Jae Seok)

167
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:05,552
(Jae Seok is escaping from Jong Kook.)

168
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:06,822
(Jae Seok)

169
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:09,052
(Haha)

170
00:07:09,782 --> 00:07:12,152
Sinsa-dong, 667. Goodness, this is driving me nuts.

171
00:07:12,152 --> 00:07:13,582
(The chasers are after Jae Seok.)

172
00:07:13,582 --> 00:07:15,052
He moved to another location.

173
00:07:16,022 --> 00:07:17,882
Jong Kook must have lost his shoe, then.

174
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,622
Now,

175
00:07:21,752 --> 00:07:23,052
let's go to Gary.

176
00:07:23,052 --> 00:07:24,282
(Jae Seok is on his way to meet Gary.)

177
00:07:24,282 --> 00:07:25,682
I'll just ask for his shoe.

178
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:29,822
I want to make it out of the voices of our members.

179
00:07:29,822 --> 00:07:30,822
- Really? - Yes.

180
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:32,322
Can you just say, "Run"?

181
00:07:32,482 --> 00:07:35,322
- You have to help me later. - Of course I will.

182
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:37,852
(It's my time to ask for a favour.)

183
00:07:37,852 --> 00:07:39,482
He might just give it to me if I ask.

184
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,622
(He's on his way to steal.)

185
00:07:45,252 --> 00:07:47,552
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo is working on "Finding Ms Right".)

186
00:07:47,852 --> 00:07:51,722
(He's calling the third applicant.)

187
00:07:52,352 --> 00:07:54,422
- Hello? - Hello, Sun Bin.

188
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:55,752
(Sun Bin?)

189
00:07:55,752 --> 00:07:57,752
- Yes, hello. - Hi, I'm Lee Kwang Soo.

190
00:07:58,522 --> 00:07:59,722
(Rising star Lee Sun Bin)

191
00:07:59,722 --> 00:08:01,822
You don't exactly know what this is about, do you?

192
00:08:02,622 --> 00:08:04,682
They wouldn't go into details.

193
00:08:04,682 --> 00:08:05,752
Right.

194
00:08:06,222 --> 00:08:08,752
This is awkward for me to say it myself,

195
00:08:08,752 --> 00:08:11,652
but I'm meeting the people that mentioned...

196
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:15,422
that I'm their ideal type for short dates.

197
00:08:16,182 --> 00:08:18,222
- I see. - Is there a date idea...

198
00:08:18,222 --> 00:08:21,422
you've been wanting to do?

199
00:08:21,952 --> 00:08:24,282
Well, maybe the arcade?

200
00:08:24,282 --> 00:08:27,582
- The arcade? - Or maybe the ball park?

201
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:30,552
- A ball park. - I like being active.

202
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,182
- I see, you like being active. - Yes.

203
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:35,652
Things that I saved to do later with my boyfriend.

204
00:08:35,652 --> 00:08:38,822
(I've been saving it for you.)

205
00:08:39,782 --> 00:08:41,552
- The arcade... - I see.

206
00:08:41,552 --> 00:08:46,522
Okay, then. We'll try to go to the arcade or the ball field.

207
00:08:46,922 --> 00:08:48,682
- Okay. - I'll be over soon.

208
00:08:48,752 --> 00:08:50,382
- See you soon. - Bye.

209
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:55,352
Things like "See you soon"...

210
00:08:56,922 --> 00:08:58,782
really drive you nuts.

211
00:08:59,182 --> 00:09:00,222
You know.

212
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:01,922
(He's already way ahead of himself.)

213
00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:03,822
I'm already so happy.

214
00:09:03,822 --> 00:09:05,282
(He's already way ahead of himself.)

215
00:09:07,782 --> 00:09:09,922
(Although he only has one shoe on,)

216
00:09:10,322 --> 00:09:12,752
(his mind is completely ready for the date.)

217
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:14,222
It must be here.

218
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:15,652
(His exciting date starts now.)

219
00:09:15,652 --> 00:09:16,952
Hello, Sun Bin.

220
00:09:17,952 --> 00:09:19,622
Hello.

221
00:09:19,622 --> 00:09:20,622
(Embarrassed)

222
00:09:21,422 --> 00:09:22,952
Nice to meet you.

223
00:09:22,952 --> 00:09:23,992
Hello.

224
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,582
Baseball? Is this a baseball place?

225
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:29,252
- Your shoe... - Yes.

226
00:09:29,622 --> 00:09:32,322
I should have bought a new pair. They took away my shoe.

227
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,752
- Really? - Yes. There must be something more.

228
00:09:34,822 --> 00:09:37,622
- Should we go up first? - Yes, here...

229
00:09:37,752 --> 00:09:40,382
I was going to buy something on my way, but...

230
00:09:40,382 --> 00:09:42,822
- It's not necessary. - there was so much traffic.

231
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:45,652
First...

232
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:47,282
(Glancing)

233
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:48,822
(She's in love.)

234
00:09:52,522 --> 00:09:56,652
Such an experience is so hard to come by.

235
00:09:56,652 --> 00:09:58,922
- I never imagined this. - Right.

236
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:01,052
It's so hot.

237
00:10:02,622 --> 00:10:04,652
My face turned red, right?

238
00:10:04,752 --> 00:10:07,282
What kind of men do you like?

239
00:10:07,282 --> 00:10:08,582
You.

240
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:10,422
My...

241
00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:12,052
Like that...

242
00:10:12,882 --> 00:10:16,282
(He came to me.)

243
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,752
Have you done a date like this?

244
00:10:17,782 --> 00:10:18,952
No.

245
00:10:19,022 --> 00:10:20,082
- Is it your first? - Yes.

246
00:10:21,022 --> 00:10:22,922
I haven't, so I wanted to try it.

247
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,492
Then let's...

248
00:10:24,852 --> 00:10:26,382
- Should we try it? - Okay.

249
00:10:27,022 --> 00:10:28,922
- There's something I want to ask. - Okay.

250
00:10:29,582 --> 00:10:31,522
How many people did you call before me?

251
00:10:31,522 --> 00:10:33,182
(Did you call other girls before me?)

252
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:34,882
Sit for a second.

253
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:37,852
- Is that important to you? - Yes.

254
00:10:37,852 --> 00:10:39,222
It's important.

255
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:40,992
Let me just say one thing.

256
00:10:41,382 --> 00:10:43,752
- There were several categories... - Okay.

257
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:47,252
I could choose from today, and I chose this category.

258
00:10:47,752 --> 00:10:49,182
I picked it for you.

259
00:10:49,822 --> 00:10:51,182
I mean it.

260
00:10:51,182 --> 00:10:53,552
So how many were there?

261
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:55,252
I saw...

262
00:10:56,682 --> 00:10:59,022
- You're the third person to meet. - Pardon?

263
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:00,352
- Is that important? - Yes.

264
00:11:01,782 --> 00:11:03,652
You must have done a lot of things.

265
00:11:04,152 --> 00:11:05,152
What is this?

266
00:11:06,252 --> 00:11:08,022
(Song Ji Eun's initials are on his nail.)

267
00:11:08,022 --> 00:11:10,182
- What is this? - Hold on, hold on.

268
00:11:10,952 --> 00:11:13,552
SJE. Who is SJE?

269
00:11:14,122 --> 00:11:15,952
(What is this?)

270
00:11:15,952 --> 00:11:17,482
(Just say that it's Seok Jin.)

271
00:11:19,622 --> 00:11:20,752
Should we increase the volume?

272
00:11:20,752 --> 00:11:21,782
(We're in Gary's studio.)

273
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,382
(Jae Seok is here for his next target.)

274
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,522
- Jae Seok. - Gary.

275
00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:26,122
Hey.

276
00:11:26,922 --> 00:11:28,622
You promised to help me with my mission.

277
00:11:28,752 --> 00:11:29,882
What is your mission?

278
00:11:31,382 --> 00:11:35,922
With Gary, it's best to just say what my mission is...

279
00:11:35,952 --> 00:11:38,382
and ask him for it. That would be faster.

280
00:11:38,382 --> 00:11:39,682
(Will the strategy work on Gary?)

281
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,682
- I'll be honest with you. - Okay.

282
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:46,752
You and I need to exchange something.

283
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:48,922
- That way I'll clear the mission. - Exchange what?

284
00:11:48,922 --> 00:11:50,122
Shoe or something.

285
00:11:50,182 --> 00:11:51,722
How many did you get so far?

286
00:11:52,282 --> 00:11:53,322
Right now,

287
00:11:53,652 --> 00:11:56,052
- I've done three. - I need to think about this.

288
00:11:56,052 --> 00:11:57,482
I helped you before.

289
00:11:57,482 --> 00:12:01,052
You're so close to succeeding.

290
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:03,382
There's nothing bad in it for you.

291
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:05,122
It's just a matter of me succeeding or not.

292
00:12:05,122 --> 00:12:06,682
(Thinking)

293
00:12:07,282 --> 00:12:08,852
- Then Jae Seok... - Just switch shoes with me.

294
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:10,622
- Shoes? - Yes. Is your size 270mm?

295
00:12:10,622 --> 00:12:12,822
- Yes. Are you the same? - Yes, my size is 270mm as well.

296
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:17,452
Please switch them with me. I'm so tired. I'm not joking.

297
00:12:18,522 --> 00:12:20,482
(Hold on, Jae Seok.)

298
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:23,982
Let's switch just one shoe for style.

299
00:12:24,222 --> 00:12:26,052
(I have to keep my style.)

300
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:27,482
Left or right?

301
00:12:27,482 --> 00:12:30,122
- Whichever one you want. - Then the right shoe.

302
00:12:30,122 --> 00:12:31,122
The right shoe.

303
00:12:31,722 --> 00:12:34,282
It fits perfectly. It looks pretty good.

304
00:12:34,282 --> 00:12:36,682
- We're such a good match. - You're right, it fits perfectly.

305
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:38,252
See? I'll get going.

306
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:39,682
Are you leaving already?

307
00:12:39,682 --> 00:12:42,822
I already did my mission. I have to go somewhere else.

308
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:44,252
- Okay. - Thank you.

309
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:47,052
- I helped you. - Okay.

310
00:12:47,582 --> 00:12:49,222
- Thank you for keeping the promise. - No problem.

311
00:12:49,222 --> 00:12:51,052
You kept your promise.

312
00:12:51,052 --> 00:12:53,852
- I'm helping you so you won't fail. - Okay, I'm going.

313
00:12:53,852 --> 00:12:55,952
(After finishing his mission, James Bond leaves the room.)

314
00:12:58,182 --> 00:12:59,482
He came and left like the wind.

315
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:03,482
I'm out of it.

316
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,482
(His fashion style improved.)

317
00:13:06,382 --> 00:13:07,722
Gary and I are exactly the same size.

318
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:10,082
Gary brought it up first.

319
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:13,222
He thought that switching both might be weird.

320
00:13:13,682 --> 00:13:15,352
All I needed was one shoe.

321
00:13:15,722 --> 00:13:17,622
(He's so clueless.)

322
00:13:20,222 --> 00:13:22,322
(You just lost 10 percent of your final rating to the Scene-stealer.)

323
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:26,122
(He's figuring it out now.)

324
00:13:28,382 --> 00:13:30,822
(Sighing)

325
00:13:32,122 --> 00:13:33,752
What is this?

326
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:39,052
(He only has to get Haha's shoes.)

327
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:40,252
Haha is the problem.

328
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:42,152
What should I do?

329
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:43,952
I should think carefully about it.

330
00:13:46,182 --> 00:13:48,582
This is driving me crazy.

331
00:13:49,682 --> 00:13:51,282
Where am I supposed to go?

332
00:13:51,282 --> 00:13:53,182
(His mission will be complete with Haha's shoe.)

333
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:55,182
We just exited the highway.

334
00:13:55,482 --> 00:13:57,322
- Where are we now? - Let's see.

335
00:13:57,652 --> 00:13:59,552
(The chase is on.)

336
00:14:01,322 --> 00:14:02,322
(Jae Seok)

337
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:05,482
I wonder where he's hiding.

338
00:14:05,482 --> 00:14:06,482
(He came to Han River to lure Haha in.)

339
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:09,882
He's at Han River.

340
00:14:10,822 --> 00:14:11,852
It's Han River.

341
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:12,952
(He succeeds in luring Haha,)

342
00:14:13,682 --> 00:14:15,522
They're all coming this way.

343
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,622
(but now everyone is coming towards him.)

344
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:17,882
All of them.

345
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,322
(What will be the Scene-stealer's fate?)

346
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:23,022
Hit it. Hit it a little more.

347
00:14:23,752 --> 00:14:25,952
(They're having a very active date.)

348
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:26,952
This...

349
00:14:27,552 --> 00:14:28,722
Am I doing it right?

350
00:14:28,782 --> 00:14:29,782
It's over.

351
00:14:29,782 --> 00:14:30,782
(I'll do it if you like it.)

352
00:14:32,022 --> 00:14:34,782
(She can hardly breathe.)

353
00:14:35,682 --> 00:14:37,782
I'm confident about this one. Hold on.

354
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:41,722
(He hits 30 points.)

355
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:44,522
(Did you see that, Sun Bin?)

356
00:14:45,422 --> 00:14:46,722
Is this how you do it?

357
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:49,852
- Really? - Loosen up the shoulders.

358
00:14:49,852 --> 00:14:51,622
(I'll teach you.)

359
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:53,382
Loosen up your shoulders.

360
00:14:54,282 --> 00:14:56,582
Bring your arm out. Bring it out.

361
00:14:57,122 --> 00:14:59,182
(He's getting close to her.)

362
00:14:59,182 --> 00:15:01,282
- Look. - Here?

363
00:15:01,282 --> 00:15:04,182
Make sure your view is straight. Align this and this.

364
00:15:04,182 --> 00:15:05,322
(She looks good.)

365
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:06,322
I'll shoot.

366
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:10,382
Yes.

367
00:15:10,382 --> 00:15:11,422
(She shoots 50 points.)

368
00:15:12,382 --> 00:15:15,122
(Whatever she shoots,)

369
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,222
This is crazy.

370
00:15:16,222 --> 00:15:18,052
(she gets it on the bullseye.)

371
00:15:18,052 --> 00:15:20,252
- Am I doing well? - You didn't miss any, right?

372
00:15:20,282 --> 00:15:21,782
- Pardon? No. - You didn't miss any, right?

373
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,382
- You're so good. - Look at this.

374
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:25,682
(You're really good.)

375
00:15:26,922 --> 00:15:27,952
Gosh.

376
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:29,852
(She's getting them all.)

377
00:15:29,852 --> 00:15:31,522
- Do you come here often? - Did I do too well?

378
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:32,522
Tell me.

379
00:15:33,022 --> 00:15:35,382
You came here last week, didn't you? Who did you come with?

380
00:15:37,422 --> 00:15:42,022
(After their sweet date,)

381
00:15:42,022 --> 00:15:45,122
(it's finally time for the truth.)

382
00:15:45,122 --> 00:15:46,152
I'll ask you the question.

383
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:48,322
Lee Kwang Soo is really my ideal type.

384
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,382
(I really like Lee Kwang Soo.)

385
00:15:51,382 --> 00:15:52,382
Yes.

386
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:55,952
(Is she telling us the truth?)

387
00:15:55,952 --> 00:15:57,152
This is actually...

388
00:15:59,322 --> 00:16:00,382
This...

389
00:16:00,382 --> 00:16:01,552
(Liar warning)

390
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:02,822
This...

391
00:16:04,222 --> 00:16:07,422
(She's clenching her teeth.)

392
00:16:07,422 --> 00:16:09,382
Pardon? Nothing happened.

393
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:11,722
(It's a misunderstanding.)

394
00:16:12,282 --> 00:16:14,482
Let's go again. Can we do it one more time?

395
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:16,422
(Again?)

396
00:16:16,782 --> 00:16:17,822
(Do you want me to feel the pain again?)

397
00:16:17,822 --> 00:16:19,522
- You need to press it faster. - Are you nervous?

398
00:16:19,522 --> 00:16:22,022
- Pardon? No? - Let's see.

399
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,022
(Nervous)

400
00:16:23,752 --> 00:16:24,782
My...

401
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:26,522
ideal type...

402
00:16:28,652 --> 00:16:29,682
is Lee Kwang Soo.

403
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:31,582
Yes.

404
00:16:32,722 --> 00:16:35,282
It hasn't been that many days.

405
00:16:35,422 --> 00:16:37,222
- It couldn't have changed. - Of course not.

406
00:16:37,522 --> 00:16:38,682
You even said so on television.

407
00:16:38,682 --> 00:16:39,782
(It's impossible.)

408
00:16:39,782 --> 00:16:41,552
(It's possible.)

409
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:44,582
What?

410
00:16:45,782 --> 00:16:46,952
I'm being honest.

411
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:48,022
(What's wrong with this machine?)

412
00:16:48,552 --> 00:16:49,722
Enough with the lying detector.

413
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:53,022
Are you sure you're not using a remote control?

414
00:16:53,022 --> 00:16:54,952
- This is upsetting. - How did you stand that?

415
00:16:54,952 --> 00:16:57,952
I tried to stand the pain, but it really hurts.

416
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:00,182
(Sun Bin, does your hand hurt?)

417
00:17:00,182 --> 00:17:03,022
- It hurts. I'm being honest. - Thank you.

418
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,582
Thank you so much.

419
00:17:04,582 --> 00:17:05,722
(Kwang Soo fails his mission.)

420
00:17:07,252 --> 00:17:09,692
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok is waiting with his trap.)

421
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:11,582
Over there. I see cameras.

422
00:17:11,582 --> 00:17:12,582
(Haha has arrived.)

423
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:15,122
(It's Haha.)

424
00:17:15,122 --> 00:17:16,122
Good.

425
00:17:16,282 --> 00:17:18,222
(He's starting to hide.)

426
00:17:19,852 --> 00:17:22,482
(Jae Seok has to be here somewhere.)

427
00:17:23,552 --> 00:17:26,222
(He's waiting for his opportunity.)

428
00:17:26,452 --> 00:17:30,252
(Steal Haha's shoe and his mission is complete.)

429
00:17:31,222 --> 00:17:32,422
Let's go.

430
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:34,982
Let's hurry. Run, run, run.

431
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,252
Let's go.

432
00:17:36,882 --> 00:17:38,782
- I've never done this before. - You see...

433
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:40,582
Everyone's really fast.

434
00:17:40,582 --> 00:17:41,722
- As runners? - Yes.

435
00:17:41,722 --> 00:17:43,282
They're fast. Aren't you?

436
00:17:43,282 --> 00:17:44,782
I used to run track and field.

437
00:17:44,922 --> 00:17:46,322
- Really? - I can run.

438
00:17:46,352 --> 00:17:47,882
You can't just run after them.

439
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:49,692
You must ambush them.

440
00:17:50,422 --> 00:17:51,882
Didn't I look cool saying that?

441
00:17:51,882 --> 00:17:53,852
- I just realised that. - I can tell.

442
00:17:53,852 --> 00:17:55,522
I'm telling you things about...

443
00:17:55,522 --> 00:17:57,552
- what you don't know. - Exactly.

444
00:17:57,552 --> 00:18:00,192
- I think I feel so sexy. - Okay.

445
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:01,322
Don't you agree?

446
00:18:01,322 --> 00:18:02,522
(Trust me.)

447
00:18:02,522 --> 00:18:04,152
- I get it. - So...

448
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:06,222
(Meanwhile, by the river)

449
00:18:06,222 --> 00:18:08,052
- What? - Is Jae Seok not here?

450
00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:09,052
(They search for Jae Seok.)

451
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:10,382
We haven't found him yet.

452
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:11,622
Where is he?

453
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:14,022
Where is he hiding?

454
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,752
I'll show you what I can do.

455
00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:19,882
(James Bond's target is Haha's shoe.)

456
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:22,582
(An ambush is the only way to go.)

457
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:26,882
(Haha approaches Jae Seok's trap.)

458
00:18:26,882 --> 00:18:30,322
(Haha, is that you?)

459
00:18:31,622 --> 00:18:37,452
(Come on, just a little bit closer.)

460
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:39,082
What are you doing there?

461
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:40,652
Wait a moment.

462
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:43,552
- Open up. - What's going on?

463
00:18:43,552 --> 00:18:45,952
What's going on? Why is it you?

464
00:18:45,952 --> 00:18:47,282
What's this?

465
00:18:47,282 --> 00:18:48,482
(No! It's Ji Hyo.)

466
00:18:49,052 --> 00:18:50,852
(He opened the door expecting Haha.)

467
00:18:50,852 --> 00:18:52,282
What are you doing there?

468
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,082
Wait a moment.

469
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:55,922
- Open up. - What's going on?

470
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,192
Why is it you?

471
00:18:57,382 --> 00:18:59,922
No! No!

472
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:01,822
No!

473
00:19:01,922 --> 00:19:03,222
We got you.

474
00:19:03,222 --> 00:19:04,882
(Ji Hyo captured James Bond.)

475
00:19:05,982 --> 00:19:07,852
I don't believe this.

476
00:19:07,852 --> 00:19:09,322
(Ji Hyo takes the views Jae Seok stole.)

477
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:11,722
(Jae Seok loses 50 percent of his views.)

478
00:19:13,082 --> 00:19:14,252
Hang on.

479
00:19:14,482 --> 00:19:17,282
What was all that about? I lost my will to work now.

480
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,582
After all you put us through?

481
00:19:19,582 --> 00:19:20,782
That was nothing.

482
00:19:20,782 --> 00:19:22,852
It wasn't nothing. It was raining.

483
00:19:22,852 --> 00:19:25,152
- Okay, fine. I'm sorry. - Darn it.

484
00:19:25,422 --> 00:19:27,582
- My shoes are soaked. - You were working out.

485
00:19:27,582 --> 00:19:30,352
What if he comes first even with minus half the views?

486
00:19:30,782 --> 00:19:31,982
(It's down to the viewers.)

487
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:34,722
The winner of today's mission is Ji Hyo.

488
00:19:34,722 --> 00:19:37,782
- She ripped my name tag. - You eliminated Jae Seok.

489
00:19:37,782 --> 00:19:40,422
- I thought everyone had left. - Jae Seok stole...

490
00:19:40,652 --> 00:19:44,782
10 percent of everyone's views but they all go to Ji Hyo.

491
00:19:44,782 --> 00:19:46,652
She'll win then.

492
00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:48,122
- She'll win. - She'll win.

493
00:19:48,122 --> 00:19:49,752
That alone was fun.

494
00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:52,822
We'll count the views for 24 hours.

495
00:19:53,252 --> 00:19:54,952
Those results will affect...

496
00:19:54,952 --> 00:19:56,782
the following race.

497
00:19:56,782 --> 00:19:58,692
- I see. - I have a disadvantage.

498
00:19:58,692 --> 00:20:00,982
I lost 50 percent. I'll come last.

499
00:20:01,282 --> 00:20:03,222
You should've done better, then.

500
00:20:03,222 --> 00:20:06,622
You got to play the lead. You should've done better.

501
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,222
- I did. I got your stylist to help. - What did you do?

502
00:20:09,552 --> 00:20:10,882
Stop complaining.

503
00:20:11,152 --> 00:20:14,052
- Please watch our videos. - Please do.

504
00:20:14,052 --> 00:20:16,152
(What are the results of today's super hot mission?)

505
00:20:16,152 --> 00:20:19,522
(30 minutes later)

506
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:22,152
(Here's the couple we'd forgotten about.)

507
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,752
(It can't be...)

508
00:20:24,752 --> 00:20:25,882
Seriously?

509
00:20:28,222 --> 00:20:29,452
Did they all leave?

510
00:20:30,082 --> 00:20:31,482
Did they go home?

511
00:20:33,582 --> 00:20:36,052
How can you film the ending without me?

512
00:20:37,582 --> 00:20:38,722
Did they go home?

513
00:20:39,692 --> 00:20:41,222
This is so annoying.

514
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:44,252
Okay, so...

515
00:20:44,822 --> 00:20:47,052
I had no idea this would happen.

516
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:49,692
- We decided to start dating. - What?

517
00:20:49,852 --> 00:20:51,552
- We decided to start dating. - What?

518
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:52,622
(Oh, my goodness.)

519
00:20:52,622 --> 00:20:53,652
Dear viewers.

520
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:57,222
We'll announce our wedding plans next week.

521
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,522
Everything about our love story...

522
00:21:00,522 --> 00:21:02,522
(Check it out in their 3-minute video.)

523
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:04,282
It's all in our video.

524
00:21:04,622 --> 00:21:06,052
Thank you.

525
00:21:06,052 --> 00:21:09,582
(Kwang Soo and his maybe-girlfriend finally complete their video.)

526
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:10,852
(Kwang Soo is my ideal type.)

527
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:15,252
(We counted the views logged at 8am the following day.)

528
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:24,782
(View ratings)

529
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:29,052
(One week later)

530
00:21:29,052 --> 00:21:31,652
Okay, so...

531
00:21:31,922 --> 00:21:35,052
I'll announce the standings of the number of views.

532
00:21:35,052 --> 00:21:37,122
- It was so hot. - Already?

533
00:21:37,122 --> 00:21:39,122
We know who came first and last.

534
00:21:39,122 --> 00:21:41,452
The one with the most views is Kim Jong Kook.

535
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:43,082
Kim Jong Kook.

536
00:21:43,652 --> 00:21:44,652
Hey.

537
00:21:44,652 --> 00:21:46,452
Did you contact your fans?

538
00:21:46,452 --> 00:21:47,952
- Did you? - I did not.

539
00:21:47,952 --> 00:21:50,822
Ji Hyo, you got 10 percent of his views and he still won?

540
00:21:50,822 --> 00:21:52,322
What's going on?

541
00:21:52,322 --> 00:21:54,522
- Jong Kook's too... - Thank you.

542
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,652
I think I should run for office.

543
00:21:57,822 --> 00:21:59,952
I don't believe this.

544
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,822
I should run for some online office.

545
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:03,052
Anyang Constituency.

546
00:22:03,682 --> 00:22:05,222
He always bosses people around.

547
00:22:05,322 --> 00:22:08,382
- He will if he runs for office. - He's bossy wherever he goes.

548
00:22:08,652 --> 00:22:10,622
I'll run for some online office.

549
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:11,782
Coming in second...

550
00:22:12,422 --> 00:22:13,982
- Haha. - Really?

551
00:22:13,982 --> 00:22:16,782
- You owe it to Got7. - He did nothing.

552
00:22:17,022 --> 00:22:19,282
Coming in third is Ji Hyo.

553
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,252
- Fourth is Gary. - What would've happened...

554
00:22:22,252 --> 00:22:23,682
if you didn't take my 10 percent?

555
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:24,752
Poor Ji Hyo.

556
00:22:24,752 --> 00:22:26,852
- Kwang Soo came fifth. - Kwang Soo?

557
00:22:26,852 --> 00:22:29,182
- Wasn't that the hottest clip? - I was so curious.

558
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,822
I wanted to watch his.

559
00:22:30,822 --> 00:22:32,522
Kwang Soo actually likes them all.

560
00:22:32,882 --> 00:22:34,482
(He had an ulterior motive.)

561
00:22:34,482 --> 00:22:36,482
- What do you mean? - What will you do?

562
00:22:36,482 --> 00:22:39,622
- Is it Ji Eun or Sun Bin? - Who is it?

563
00:22:39,622 --> 00:22:42,122
I'll explain everything in our chat room.

564
00:22:42,182 --> 00:22:43,282
- It's Sun Bin. - Oh, please.

565
00:22:43,282 --> 00:22:44,652
And then...

566
00:22:44,922 --> 00:22:46,352
in sixth place...

567
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:48,922
is Jae Seok who lost half his views.

568
00:22:48,922 --> 00:22:50,282
- What? - Seok Jin's last?

569
00:22:50,622 --> 00:22:51,722
Excuse me?

570
00:22:52,282 --> 00:22:54,152
- Seriously? - Are you kidding me?

571
00:22:54,152 --> 00:22:56,552
People really must not care about you at all.

572
00:22:56,552 --> 00:22:58,222
- Are you serious? - They don't care.

573
00:22:58,222 --> 00:23:01,052
- I thought I'd come last. - Seok Jin came last.

574
00:23:01,052 --> 00:23:02,122
He lost half.

575
00:23:02,122 --> 00:23:03,852
I lost half my views.

576
00:23:03,852 --> 00:23:05,282
Focus on your radio show.

577
00:23:05,282 --> 00:23:07,052
Get the listeners to support you.

578
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,582
I just don't get it.

579
00:23:08,882 --> 00:23:11,322
I told you a week ago that...

580
00:23:11,322 --> 00:23:13,452
this ranking would affect today's game.

581
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:15,822
Today's final race is called...

582
00:23:15,882 --> 00:23:17,552
"Running Man Go".

583
00:23:18,152 --> 00:23:20,352
- You have 200 minutes. - 200 minutes?

584
00:23:20,552 --> 00:23:22,522
- You'll be chased... - 200 minutes?

585
00:23:22,722 --> 00:23:25,422
by 102 hunters.

586
00:23:25,422 --> 00:23:28,022
You'll be chased by 102 hunters.

587
00:23:28,022 --> 00:23:29,322
102 hunters?

588
00:23:29,322 --> 00:23:32,922
(I can barely evade 1 person and they're sending 102?)

589
00:23:34,052 --> 00:23:36,322
(24 hours ago)

590
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:38,422
(All over SBS)

591
00:23:41,482 --> 00:23:43,752
(Lee Wan, actor)

592
00:23:44,522 --> 00:23:47,422
(It's a poster recruiting hunters!)

593
00:23:47,422 --> 00:23:48,652
"Hunters"?

594
00:23:49,182 --> 00:23:51,482
"Running Man will appear all over Yeouido."

595
00:23:52,282 --> 00:23:53,752
Is this that?

596
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,522
A marathon?

597
00:23:56,422 --> 00:23:58,622
Do they evolve each time they're caught?

598
00:23:58,952 --> 00:24:00,222
(Growing horns)

599
00:24:00,382 --> 00:24:02,682
Will we get to chase the Running Man members?

600
00:24:02,752 --> 00:24:03,882
In real life?

601
00:24:04,252 --> 00:24:07,822
- I want in. - We have to apply.

602
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:09,882
Can we be on Running Man?

603
00:24:10,122 --> 00:24:12,082
- Can we take part? - Yes.

604
00:24:12,082 --> 00:24:13,952
Can I apply?

605
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:16,622
Can I apply?

606
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,382
You should apply.

607
00:24:19,052 --> 00:24:21,052
Only you can go after Jong Kook.

608
00:24:21,052 --> 00:24:24,382
- Hands up if you want in. - Me.

609
00:24:25,552 --> 00:24:29,052
(Running Man Go)

610
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:30,822
(Running Man Go starts.)

611
00:24:30,822 --> 00:24:34,382
(Yeouido Hangang Park)

612
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,982
(D-day has arrived.)

613
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,422
(The 102 hunters gathered in Yeouido.)

614
00:24:42,322 --> 00:24:43,382
Thank you.

615
00:24:43,852 --> 00:24:44,922
Here you go.

616
00:24:44,922 --> 00:24:48,352
(Idol singers, actors and comedians all applied to take part.)

617
00:24:50,752 --> 00:24:51,922
Let's show them us eating.

618
00:24:51,922 --> 00:24:54,522
- We have to eat. - I'll explain what to do.

619
00:24:54,522 --> 00:24:55,752
Press it once.

620
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,522
You can film with others, too.

621
00:24:58,522 --> 00:24:59,582
(They film themselves.)

622
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:00,852
Hello.

623
00:25:00,852 --> 00:25:02,382
Hello, everyone.

624
00:25:02,382 --> 00:25:04,052
I hope Chang Ryul and Jong Kook don't fight.

625
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:07,552
According to the ranking, Jong Kook gets seven hunters.

626
00:25:07,622 --> 00:25:08,982
Haha gets nine.

627
00:25:09,322 --> 00:25:10,722
(9 Haha Hunters)

628
00:25:12,222 --> 00:25:13,882
11 Ji Hyo Hunters.

629
00:25:14,852 --> 00:25:16,622
13 Gary Hunters.

630
00:25:16,622 --> 00:25:18,322
(13 Gary Hunters)

631
00:25:18,722 --> 00:25:20,452
15 Kwang Soo Hunters.

632
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,582
(15 Kwang Soo Hunters)

633
00:25:22,182 --> 00:25:23,822
20 Jae Seok Hunters.

634
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,182
(20 Jae Seok Hunters)

635
00:25:25,182 --> 00:25:27,722
Seok Jin will be chased by 27 hunters.

636
00:25:27,722 --> 00:25:28,852
(27 Seok Jin Hunters)

637
00:25:29,482 --> 00:25:32,422
(7 versus 102. Running Man members, be very careful!)

638
00:25:36,822 --> 00:25:38,152
You got 27.

639
00:25:38,152 --> 00:25:40,652
- They'll come after me? - I got 20.

640
00:25:40,752 --> 00:25:43,382
- Just 2 people can get me. - I got 25.

641
00:25:43,652 --> 00:25:45,182
- It can't be 25. - If...

642
00:25:45,182 --> 00:25:49,122
the hunters take all three of your name tags off, you're out.

643
00:25:49,452 --> 00:25:52,552
You have to find the Blackmon.

644
00:25:52,822 --> 00:25:55,452
The person with the Blackmon at the very end wins.

645
00:25:55,452 --> 00:25:57,552
- We have to search for him. - Yes.

646
00:25:57,782 --> 00:26:00,722
Whenever we meet someone, we have...

647
00:26:00,782 --> 00:26:02,122
- to run away. - Just run.

648
00:26:02,122 --> 00:26:04,522
(Where's the Blackmon that has to evade the members?)

649
00:26:05,182 --> 00:26:06,582
I'm ready.

650
00:26:06,922 --> 00:26:08,522
My laces are tight.

651
00:26:10,182 --> 00:26:12,322
(Blackmon Cho Jae Hyun)

652
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:15,482
(He's a charismatic and captivating actor.)

653
00:26:18,552 --> 00:26:20,882
(Blackmon Chae Soo Bin)

654
00:26:21,152 --> 00:26:24,122
(She's a great actress as she is pretty.)

655
00:26:24,122 --> 00:26:26,322
Your goal is to evade the members...

656
00:26:26,322 --> 00:26:29,852
for the duration of 200 minutes.

657
00:26:29,982 --> 00:26:32,152
As the Blackmon, you two...

658
00:26:32,282 --> 00:26:34,482
will be given a special role.

659
00:26:34,752 --> 00:26:37,352
One of you will wear a "zero dollars" tag.

660
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,282
The other will wear a "10-dollar" tag.

661
00:26:40,452 --> 00:26:44,082
If the one with the 10-dollar tag gets away without being caught,

662
00:26:44,082 --> 00:26:45,622
you will win.

663
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:49,682
(If the Blackmon with zero dollars is caught, the Blackmons win.)

664
00:26:49,682 --> 00:26:51,022
(The Blackmons take the prize.)

665
00:26:51,022 --> 00:26:53,352
So whoever of us it is,

666
00:26:53,352 --> 00:26:55,322
the one with the 10-dollar tag...

667
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,052
- should stay safe. - Correct.

668
00:26:57,352 --> 00:26:59,382
I get it now. Do you think you can evade them?

669
00:26:59,382 --> 00:27:00,422
- You have to run. - I'm not confident.

670
00:27:00,422 --> 00:27:02,622
It shows on my face when I lie.

671
00:27:03,482 --> 00:27:08,082
(Which of the Blackmons has the 10-dollar tag?)

672
00:27:09,682 --> 00:27:11,882
Whenever we meet someone, we have...

673
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:13,722
- to run away. - Just run.

674
00:27:13,722 --> 00:27:15,422
- Yes. - Just one meeting...

675
00:27:15,422 --> 00:27:16,722
Idols these days...

676
00:27:16,782 --> 00:27:18,882
My clothing colour is too flashy.

677
00:27:19,122 --> 00:27:20,422
I need to hide.

678
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:22,422
- This sounds tough. - Okay.

679
00:27:22,822 --> 00:27:25,222
The rules of the game are in the pouches...

680
00:27:25,222 --> 00:27:26,222
you were given.

681
00:27:26,222 --> 00:27:28,252
Please follow the rules.

682
00:27:28,252 --> 00:27:29,622
- Are there rules? - Yes.

683
00:27:30,152 --> 00:27:33,322
We should eliminate the name tags of those who chase after us.

684
00:27:33,322 --> 00:27:35,422
If I had Blackmons...

685
00:27:35,422 --> 00:27:39,752
- That would be so... - What is that?

686
00:27:39,752 --> 00:27:44,182
(Wait, what is that?)

687
00:27:45,822 --> 00:27:47,222
(Are they the hunters?)

688
00:27:47,222 --> 00:27:50,082
- Has it begun? - Already?

689
00:27:50,322 --> 00:27:51,882
- Gosh. - It has started?

690
00:27:52,122 --> 00:27:53,522
I didn't even know.

691
00:27:53,522 --> 00:27:56,422
(The hunters have already begun the chase.)

692
00:27:56,422 --> 00:27:57,582
What is going on?

693
00:27:59,622 --> 00:28:01,082
- Has it begun? - Already?

694
00:28:01,182 --> 00:28:02,782
- Gosh. - It has started?

695
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:03,822
(Has it begun already?)

696
00:28:03,922 --> 00:28:06,082
- Already? - Gosh, has it begun?

697
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:07,452
How can this start all of a sudden?

698
00:28:07,522 --> 00:28:08,652
(Let's run for now.)

699
00:28:08,652 --> 00:28:10,982
- Where should we go? - You can't start like this.

700
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:13,052
- Gosh. - Who are those in red shirts?

701
00:28:13,052 --> 00:28:14,652
Let's just run quickly.

702
00:28:18,052 --> 00:28:19,682
(Jong Kook, wait for me!)

703
00:28:22,722 --> 00:28:24,282
You can't start like this!

704
00:28:24,282 --> 00:28:25,982
Let's go.

705
00:28:25,982 --> 00:28:27,752
They're following me. Let's run.

706
00:28:28,022 --> 00:28:29,122
Let's go.

707
00:28:29,122 --> 00:28:30,882
(102 monsters are after the members.)

708
00:28:30,882 --> 00:28:32,952
Who are those in red shirts?

709
00:28:33,752 --> 00:28:35,782
(Target spotted.)

710
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:38,822
- Go get him! - How far can we run away?

711
00:28:39,422 --> 00:28:40,782
Tell me how far I can run away!

712
00:28:41,882 --> 00:28:43,982
(He's running at full speed.)

713
00:28:44,782 --> 00:28:46,182
He's so fast.

714
00:28:47,252 --> 00:28:49,452
Do we have a car we can use?

715
00:28:49,452 --> 00:28:50,952
- Hurry! - Hurry!

716
00:28:51,052 --> 00:28:52,252
Hurry!

717
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,682
Hurry up!

718
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,822
What's going on? There's no camera man.

719
00:28:56,822 --> 00:28:58,922
(Jae Seok evades 20 hunters.)

720
00:28:59,182 --> 00:29:00,182
Hey.

721
00:29:00,582 --> 00:29:02,982
Who are those in red t-shirts?

722
00:29:03,852 --> 00:29:05,152
Why are they chasing after me?

723
00:29:05,752 --> 00:29:07,422
My goodness.

724
00:29:07,422 --> 00:29:08,682
- I got you. - Hello.

725
00:29:09,052 --> 00:29:11,352
Gosh, how many of you are chasing after me?

726
00:29:11,452 --> 00:29:13,452
(There's only 7 of us because you ranked top before.)

727
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:14,822
- Hello. - Hello.

728
00:29:15,182 --> 00:29:16,722
You two...

729
00:29:16,882 --> 00:29:19,782
Gosh, wait. What are you doing?

730
00:29:19,782 --> 00:29:21,682
- All of our members... - Wait, Kwang Soo!

731
00:29:21,682 --> 00:29:23,482
- Kwang Soo! - Jong Kook.

732
00:29:23,482 --> 00:29:24,582
(Kwang Soo betrays Jong Kook again.)

733
00:29:26,422 --> 00:29:28,082
Step back.

734
00:29:28,622 --> 00:29:31,552
(They remove one of Jong Kook's name tags.)

735
00:29:31,552 --> 00:29:32,982
- Congratulations. - Jong Kook!

736
00:29:32,982 --> 00:29:34,082
Congratulations.

737
00:29:37,382 --> 00:29:39,982
(This isn't time...)

738
00:29:39,982 --> 00:29:43,122
(to congratulate others.)

739
00:29:46,022 --> 00:29:47,182
Gosh.

740
00:29:47,182 --> 00:29:48,282
Get away from me.

741
00:29:48,282 --> 00:29:49,882
Where were you guys hiding?

742
00:29:49,882 --> 00:29:50,952
(They tear his name tag.)

743
00:29:51,182 --> 00:29:53,182
(One of Kwang Soo's name tags is removed.)

744
00:29:53,522 --> 00:29:54,722
I could manage to escape.

745
00:29:56,282 --> 00:29:57,322
It happened all of a sudden.

746
00:29:58,452 --> 00:29:59,682
(Ji Hyo Hunter finds Ji Hyo.)

747
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:02,682
(The monster catches her.)

748
00:30:04,182 --> 00:30:05,382
(He rips her name tag.)

749
00:30:06,282 --> 00:30:07,622
(Ji Hyo loses one name tag.)

750
00:30:07,622 --> 00:30:08,722
I got it.

751
00:30:08,882 --> 00:30:11,352
You did very well.

752
00:30:11,952 --> 00:30:12,982
Gosh.

753
00:30:16,722 --> 00:30:17,852
Why are you so fast?

754
00:30:18,122 --> 00:30:19,652
How can you guys be so healthy?

755
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:22,382
Stop it.

756
00:30:22,382 --> 00:30:23,652
(Gary's name tag is eliminated.)

757
00:30:23,652 --> 00:30:24,822
Gosh.

758
00:30:26,082 --> 00:30:27,722
(The monsters are much faster than the members.)

759
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:29,082
- Did you get it? - Yes.

760
00:30:29,182 --> 00:30:30,282
Okay.

761
00:30:30,752 --> 00:30:32,282
(What about Haha?)

762
00:30:32,282 --> 00:30:33,552
Hold on.

763
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:35,552
Wait a second.

764
00:30:36,082 --> 00:30:37,322
- What's going on? - Hello.

765
00:30:37,322 --> 00:30:38,852
Please hold on.

766
00:30:38,852 --> 00:30:40,382
Wait.

767
00:30:40,682 --> 00:30:42,922
I said wait. Please.

768
00:30:43,382 --> 00:30:44,552
What's going on here?

769
00:30:44,852 --> 00:30:46,622
I got it!

770
00:30:46,622 --> 00:30:48,182
You got me too easily. This isn't fun.

771
00:30:48,922 --> 00:30:49,982
Then sing a song.

772
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:54,022
(Trot singer Ma A Sung eliminated Haha once.)

773
00:30:54,022 --> 00:30:55,982
- Wait. - What's all this?

774
00:30:55,982 --> 00:30:57,182
(Running Man members are helpless.)

775
00:30:57,182 --> 00:30:59,352
- We... - You should've gone that way.

776
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:03,652
It's impossible to survive for 200 minutes.

777
00:31:04,152 --> 00:31:05,182
Haha.

778
00:31:05,752 --> 00:31:07,752
- This is ridiculous. - Did they remove your name tag?

779
00:31:08,322 --> 00:31:09,782
- They removed my name tag. - What?

780
00:31:09,882 --> 00:31:11,482
- What about you? - I haven't lost any.

781
00:31:11,752 --> 00:31:13,222
- Gosh. - Did you lose only one name tag?

782
00:31:13,282 --> 00:31:14,682
They have no mercy.

783
00:31:14,682 --> 00:31:16,082
They don't even care that it's an entertaining show.

784
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,152
Of course, they have no mercy.

785
00:31:18,152 --> 00:31:19,252
They're just chasing after their targets.

786
00:31:19,282 --> 00:31:20,582
Jae Seok is here!

787
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:22,352
(Haha shouts out loud.)

788
00:31:22,352 --> 00:31:24,122
(Haha informs others about Jae Seok's whereabouts.)

789
00:31:24,122 --> 00:31:26,022
Haha. My goodness.

790
00:31:26,022 --> 00:31:27,922
I'm so angry now.

791
00:31:28,282 --> 00:31:29,522
Goodness.

792
00:31:31,352 --> 00:31:32,422
Hello.

793
00:31:32,452 --> 00:31:34,222
- Are you looking for Jong Kook? - No.

794
00:31:34,282 --> 00:31:35,422
- Then who? - Kwang Soo.

795
00:31:35,422 --> 00:31:36,622
- Sorry? - I'm looking for Kwang Soo.

796
00:31:36,622 --> 00:31:38,982
Kwang Soo? You must go that way.

797
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:40,722
No, that way.

798
00:31:40,782 --> 00:31:42,952
- He went that way. - Thank you.

799
00:31:42,952 --> 00:31:44,552
- Don't tell anyone that you saw me. - Okay.

800
00:31:44,552 --> 00:31:46,182
Hey, you should go that way.

801
00:31:46,182 --> 00:31:47,382
(What's important is that I survive.)

802
00:31:49,152 --> 00:31:50,182
I see a lot of monsters there.

803
00:31:50,682 --> 00:31:51,952
They're waiting for me.

804
00:31:53,022 --> 00:31:55,622
They're coming towards me.

805
00:31:57,652 --> 00:31:59,952
Goodness.

806
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:02,722
Guys. Guys.

807
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:04,982
Go get him!

808
00:32:05,082 --> 00:32:07,852
- Hello, I am Yoon Dong of Halo. - Guys.

809
00:32:07,852 --> 00:32:09,482
- Hello, I am Yoon Dong of Halo. - Hello.

810
00:32:09,482 --> 00:32:11,352
- Hello. - Ji Ho.

811
00:32:11,352 --> 00:32:13,082
- You guys are... - Hello, Jae Seok.

812
00:32:13,082 --> 00:32:15,352
- Hold on. - We got you.

813
00:32:15,352 --> 00:32:17,182
- We're sorry. - Take my name tag.

814
00:32:17,582 --> 00:32:18,722
Just remove it.

815
00:32:19,352 --> 00:32:21,882
- Gosh. - In 1, 2, 3.

816
00:32:22,352 --> 00:32:24,722
- My goodness. - Hello.

817
00:32:24,722 --> 00:32:26,452
- I'm Yoon Dong of Halo. - Hello, Yoon Dong.

818
00:32:26,952 --> 00:32:28,352
- Hello. - Yoon Hwa.

819
00:32:28,582 --> 00:32:29,752
- By the way, - Yes?

820
00:32:30,122 --> 00:32:32,282
Yoon Hwa went to a convenience store, is it okay?

821
00:32:32,622 --> 00:32:34,582
It's okay. Were you thirsty?

822
00:32:36,282 --> 00:32:41,752
(Meanwhile, Seok Jin goes to the same convenience store.)

823
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:42,952
How can the round start all of a sudden?

824
00:32:43,122 --> 00:32:44,182
(Hunters find Seok Jin right away.)

825
00:32:44,182 --> 00:32:45,182
This is so weird.

826
00:32:45,622 --> 00:32:47,382
Hey, can we talk later?

827
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:51,152
Good. Introduce yourself.

828
00:32:51,922 --> 00:32:53,722
- You're a member of 24K, right? - I am.

829
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:56,452
I really like you, Jin Heung.

830
00:32:56,922 --> 00:32:58,722
Let's get out of here first.

831
00:32:58,952 --> 00:33:00,052
No.

832
00:33:02,122 --> 00:33:03,352
Wait there.

833
00:33:03,352 --> 00:33:04,982
Excuse me, Ma'am.

834
00:33:05,922 --> 00:33:06,922
I'm sorry.

835
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:08,882
(Bewildered)

836
00:33:08,882 --> 00:33:09,882
Seok Jin.

837
00:33:09,882 --> 00:33:12,152
There are many monsters out there, right?

838
00:33:12,152 --> 00:33:13,252
Gosh.

839
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:14,552
- Hello. - What's going on?

840
00:33:14,552 --> 00:33:15,652
- He's here. - Gary...

841
00:33:15,652 --> 00:33:17,082
(Gary Hunters inform other hunters that Seok Jin is here.)

842
00:33:17,552 --> 00:33:20,052
(Let's go, Purplemons!)

843
00:33:20,052 --> 00:33:21,052
Hey.

844
00:33:21,052 --> 00:33:23,552
- You guys. - Wow!

845
00:33:23,852 --> 00:33:25,382
You guys are 24K, right?

846
00:33:25,622 --> 00:33:27,552
We'll give you a chance to run away.

847
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,452
- We will... - We'll step back for a while.

848
00:33:29,622 --> 00:33:32,122
You mean 30 seconds? You should wait 30 seconds then.

849
00:33:32,122 --> 00:33:33,752
- Okay. - We'll give you 30 seconds.

850
00:33:34,082 --> 00:33:35,182
Way to go, 24K!

851
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:36,952
- Let's go for it! - Let's go for it!

852
00:33:36,952 --> 00:33:39,282
- Ready, start! - Ready, start!

853
00:33:39,282 --> 00:33:40,322
Run!

854
00:33:40,322 --> 00:33:41,452
(Seok Jin runs as fast as he can.)

855
00:33:41,922 --> 00:33:44,422
(We'll give you 30 seconds to run away.)

856
00:33:44,552 --> 00:33:45,682
It's a long time, isn't it?

857
00:33:48,682 --> 00:33:49,752
(Seok Jin...)

858
00:33:49,752 --> 00:33:50,752
Wait!

859
00:33:50,752 --> 00:33:53,122
(is hiding in an underground passage.)

860
00:33:53,122 --> 00:33:54,222
I had 30 seconds.

861
00:33:55,182 --> 00:33:56,582
(Jae Seok has 2 name tags left.)

862
00:33:56,582 --> 00:33:57,622
Gosh.

863
00:33:57,882 --> 00:34:00,422
(He runs away again.)

864
00:34:02,122 --> 00:34:06,752
(He's running all day long thanks to 20 Jae Seok Hunters.)

865
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:08,382
Hey.

866
00:34:09,152 --> 00:34:10,182
This isn't the time for...

867
00:34:10,722 --> 00:34:12,722
You guys can't do this to me.

868
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:14,382
There are more.

869
00:34:15,592 --> 00:34:17,622
You know, this isn't a party or something.

870
00:34:18,052 --> 00:34:20,622
- You're really fast. - Listen to me, guys.

871
00:34:20,622 --> 00:34:23,552
(I must distract them.)

872
00:34:24,382 --> 00:34:25,622
Lift the camera.

873
00:34:25,622 --> 00:34:27,322
What are you doing? We must take photos.

874
00:34:27,822 --> 00:34:30,182
Make sure you're inside the frame. Lift up your face.

875
00:34:30,422 --> 00:34:33,422
Turn the camera this way. Let's take a photo.

876
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:34,882
That's it.

877
00:34:34,882 --> 00:34:36,282
(He tries to distract his monsters.)

878
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,152
Good. Let's take it.

879
00:34:39,482 --> 00:34:40,852
Let me take a photo with Halo.

880
00:34:41,182 --> 00:34:43,152
Let's take it with Halo.

881
00:34:43,152 --> 00:34:46,422
(Everyone takes a photo with Jae Seok.)

882
00:34:46,422 --> 00:34:48,282
Good. Come here, "People Looking for Laughter" members.

883
00:34:48,382 --> 00:34:49,482
- "People Looking for Laughter". - Come over here.

884
00:34:49,482 --> 00:34:53,252
(Jae Seok Hunters almost forgot what their mission was.)

885
00:34:53,252 --> 00:34:54,352
My goodness.

886
00:34:55,322 --> 00:34:56,592
We need two more...

887
00:34:56,592 --> 00:34:57,752
Bring two more monsters.

888
00:34:57,852 --> 00:34:58,882
There is Haha.

889
00:34:59,652 --> 00:35:00,682
Where?

890
00:35:00,852 --> 00:35:02,482
There is Haha.

891
00:35:02,482 --> 00:35:03,522
(Jae Seok starts running again.)

892
00:35:06,282 --> 00:35:10,552
(Will he be able to make his way away from the monsters?)

893
00:35:12,982 --> 00:35:14,282
They're coming from that way.

894
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:15,882
Gosh.

895
00:35:16,552 --> 00:35:17,682
Come on, guys.

896
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:19,552
Goodness.

897
00:35:19,552 --> 00:35:20,922
- Hello. - Hello.

898
00:35:20,922 --> 00:35:21,952
You can't escape this time.

899
00:35:21,952 --> 00:35:23,482
(Jae Seok's name tag is removed.)

900
00:35:25,352 --> 00:35:26,752
I'm sorry.

901
00:35:27,022 --> 00:35:28,782
I know I cheated.

902
00:35:29,182 --> 00:35:30,282
I'm sorry.

903
00:35:30,782 --> 00:35:32,052
But the looks in your eyes...

904
00:35:33,122 --> 00:35:35,552
have totally changed.

905
00:35:36,222 --> 00:35:39,182
You looked very nice on the stage before.

906
00:35:39,752 --> 00:35:42,122
Halo, you guys are the same. What's the matter?

907
00:35:42,382 --> 00:35:45,052
- I'll make sure to stop them. - Okay.

908
00:35:45,052 --> 00:35:47,182
- Please hide well. I'm exhausted. - Okay.

909
00:35:47,182 --> 00:35:48,352
This is driving me crazy.

910
00:35:48,452 --> 00:35:50,782
- I will... - Stay right there for a while.

911
00:35:51,092 --> 00:35:53,022
Sung Ki, stay there.

912
00:35:53,122 --> 00:35:54,382
Min Ki, don't come close to me.

913
00:35:54,382 --> 00:35:55,622
(Where should he hide?)

914
00:35:55,752 --> 00:35:56,982
- Goodbye. - Bye.

915
00:35:58,682 --> 00:35:59,752
Gosh.

916
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:01,682
This is crazy.

917
00:36:03,022 --> 00:36:04,222
I got a message.

918
00:36:04,222 --> 00:36:05,282
This is where the Blackmons are.

919
00:36:05,522 --> 00:36:06,592
Where is this place?

920
00:36:07,122 --> 00:36:08,722
I have no idea where it is.

921
00:36:09,322 --> 00:36:10,882
Don't you think the cab drivers will know?

922
00:36:10,882 --> 00:36:12,422
(Let's go ask the taxi drivers.)

923
00:36:12,622 --> 00:36:14,652
I think it's near Yeouido.

924
00:36:16,022 --> 00:36:17,122
Korea National Assembly Building?

925
00:36:17,822 --> 00:36:19,052
Isn't this 63 Building?

926
00:36:21,022 --> 00:36:24,122
(They head to the place where the Blackmons are.)

927
00:36:24,552 --> 00:36:26,652
- Jong Kook, Redmons are coming. - Really?

928
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:28,092
(Jong Kook Hunters show up.)

929
00:36:28,092 --> 00:36:30,052
Why are they so tenacious?

930
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,022
Hello!

931
00:36:32,022 --> 00:36:33,522
- Gosh. - Chang Ryul is here, too.

932
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:35,522
- They just got my name tag. - Hello.

933
00:36:35,522 --> 00:36:37,052
- I just lost my name tag. - Hello.

934
00:36:37,052 --> 00:36:39,182
- I said, they just removed mine. - Congratulations!

935
00:36:39,182 --> 00:36:40,552
- But it wasn't me. - Hello.

936
00:36:40,882 --> 00:36:42,922
- I said they just removed mine. - Congratulations!

937
00:36:43,352 --> 00:36:44,552
My goodness.

938
00:36:44,722 --> 00:36:45,852
Congratulations!

939
00:36:45,852 --> 00:36:47,982
(Selfish Kwang Soo runs away by himself.)

940
00:36:48,652 --> 00:36:50,282
You can't do this to me.

941
00:36:50,282 --> 00:36:52,592
We're close. Why are you so ruthless?

942
00:36:52,592 --> 00:36:54,782
- Don't trust anyone. - Gosh.

943
00:36:54,982 --> 00:36:56,782
Please, cut me some slack.

944
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:57,952
We used to be close.

945
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:00,252
Please let me go.

946
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:01,852
- Okay. - Chang Ryul!

947
00:37:01,882 --> 00:37:02,982
You guys.

948
00:37:02,982 --> 00:37:04,652
You guys will also grow old.

949
00:37:05,252 --> 00:37:06,852
You'll grow old like me someday.

950
00:37:07,322 --> 00:37:09,852
We'll go have lunch.

951
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,122
You can run away.

952
00:37:11,452 --> 00:37:13,952
- You need to eat. - Okay, we'll have lunch.

953
00:37:13,952 --> 00:37:16,182
- Tell your manager to pay for us. - Okay.

954
00:37:16,452 --> 00:37:17,552
I will.

955
00:37:19,092 --> 00:37:21,052
I found it. It's over there.

956
00:37:21,452 --> 00:37:24,092
(Is Ji Hyo at the right place?)

957
00:37:28,452 --> 00:37:31,092
Here is a taxi. They won't be able to follow me if I take a taxi.

958
00:37:32,092 --> 00:37:33,182
What's the name of the cafe?

959
00:37:33,882 --> 00:37:35,352
(Kwang Soo finds out the name in the picture.)

960
00:37:35,352 --> 00:37:36,592
There is the name of the cafe.

961
00:37:37,452 --> 00:37:38,982
(He's happy.)

962
00:37:38,982 --> 00:37:40,022
I think I can do well today.

963
00:37:41,052 --> 00:37:42,522
Considering that I enlarged the picture...

964
00:37:43,252 --> 00:37:46,622
and found out the name of the cafe,

965
00:37:46,622 --> 00:37:47,682
I think I might win today.

966
00:37:48,952 --> 00:37:51,282
This is the place I'd like to go to.

967
00:37:52,252 --> 00:37:53,282
Thank you.

968
00:37:53,282 --> 00:37:54,652
(190 minutes before the game is over)

969
00:37:54,652 --> 00:37:55,782
(He's getting closer to Blackmon.)

970
00:37:55,782 --> 00:37:57,092
This looks similar to the picture.

971
00:37:58,522 --> 00:38:00,822
It's over there.

972
00:38:01,182 --> 00:38:02,182
Is that right?

973
00:38:02,922 --> 00:38:03,952
I'm getting tired.

974
00:38:03,952 --> 00:38:05,722
(The one who finds Blackmon first takes the advantage.)

975
00:38:07,882 --> 00:38:09,822
That's the place.

976
00:38:09,822 --> 00:38:11,352
(Who will catch Blackmon first?)

977
00:38:19,622 --> 00:38:21,982
Do others know exactly where I am?

978
00:38:22,252 --> 00:38:24,752
They can chase you only with GPS.

979
00:38:26,252 --> 00:38:28,722
(Before Jae Hyun notices she's here,)

980
00:38:28,722 --> 00:38:31,822
(she runs towards him at full speed.)

981
00:38:34,882 --> 00:38:35,922
What's happening?

982
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:39,522
(I need to run.)

983
00:38:41,122 --> 00:38:42,852
(She's running fast.)

984
00:38:44,352 --> 00:38:45,752
How far should I go?

985
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,122
Jae Hyun.

986
00:38:50,452 --> 00:38:51,682
Gosh, she's coming close.

987
00:38:51,682 --> 00:38:53,182
(The one being chased...)

988
00:38:53,182 --> 00:38:54,782
(versus the chaser)

989
00:38:56,252 --> 00:38:57,822
Give up now.

990
00:38:58,622 --> 00:39:00,052
It's over.

991
00:39:03,822 --> 00:39:06,922
Jae Hyun, give up now.

992
00:39:06,922 --> 00:39:08,152
(It's not over yet.)

993
00:39:08,752 --> 00:39:10,052
Stop it.

994
00:39:10,052 --> 00:39:12,522
(Is Blackmon Jae Hyun 10 dollars or zero dollars?)

995
00:39:13,482 --> 00:39:15,022
I said it's over.

996
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:16,252
Wait.

997
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:18,552
- Come here. - Wait a moment.

998
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:21,922
- You... - Okay. I'll just hold you for now.

999
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:24,322
- Gosh, Jae Hyun. - Long time no see.

1000
00:39:24,322 --> 00:39:26,252
Why did you keep running away?

1001
00:39:26,252 --> 00:39:28,282
- I'm tired. - Me, too.

1002
00:39:28,452 --> 00:39:31,382
Do you know how much I ran because of you?

1003
00:39:31,752 --> 00:39:33,882
This isn't catching Blackmon.

1004
00:39:33,882 --> 00:39:36,882
It's like a chase scene in an action movie. That was crazy.

1005
00:39:37,952 --> 00:39:40,152
You can relax and just walk around with me.

1006
00:39:40,152 --> 00:39:42,182
We have to meet all seven members.

1007
00:39:42,252 --> 00:39:44,322
They are desperately looking for you.

1008
00:39:44,322 --> 00:39:45,882
- You'll regret if you catch me. - They're serious.

1009
00:39:46,152 --> 00:39:47,352
What are you going to do?

1010
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:50,852
Anyway, I have to take off your name tag.

1011
00:39:50,952 --> 00:39:52,982
I'll tear it off.

1012
00:39:53,552 --> 00:39:54,682
Are you going to put yours now?

1013
00:39:55,052 --> 00:39:56,682
(Now, Blackmon Jae Hyun belongs to Ji Hyo.)

1014
00:39:56,682 --> 00:39:58,922
(Song Ji Hyo)

1015
00:39:59,252 --> 00:40:01,252
(Jae Hyun's score 200 and Ji Hyo's score 0)

1016
00:40:01,252 --> 00:40:02,782
(Jae Hyun's score 199 and Ji Hyo's score 1)

1017
00:40:03,252 --> 00:40:04,252
Hello.

1018
00:40:04,252 --> 00:40:05,952
(At the place he found with the picture...)

1019
00:40:06,152 --> 00:40:07,482
Be careful.

1020
00:40:09,922 --> 00:40:11,152
(Soo Bin is on her mission now.)

1021
00:40:11,152 --> 00:40:12,482
(Blackmons have to do a mission every hour...)

1022
00:40:12,482 --> 00:40:13,822
(to avoid Running Man members.)

1023
00:40:14,352 --> 00:40:18,782
On the ship, the girl lifted her arms...

1024
00:40:19,522 --> 00:40:21,882
(He sneaks from behind the staff.)

1025
00:40:23,092 --> 00:40:25,092
I'll skip this one.

1026
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:26,552
You failed.

1027
00:40:26,852 --> 00:40:28,022
Hello, I failed.

1028
00:40:28,852 --> 00:40:30,182
(My name tag is taken off.)

1029
00:40:30,182 --> 00:40:32,952
Hello. I'm sorry.

1030
00:40:33,252 --> 00:40:35,182
Hi, I apologise.

1031
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,752
- It's unbelievable. - Isn't it?

1032
00:40:37,452 --> 00:40:39,822
- Su Jin, I'm on Running Man. Hello. - Hello.

1033
00:40:39,822 --> 00:40:41,422
This is Running Man.

1034
00:40:41,422 --> 00:40:43,422
Don't you think...

1035
00:40:43,952 --> 00:40:46,522
we look like a couple? What should I do?

1036
00:40:46,522 --> 00:40:48,922
- She belongs to you now. - You're mine.

1037
00:40:50,252 --> 00:40:53,092
It feels like she's really mine.

1038
00:40:53,092 --> 00:40:54,092
(He's interested in something else now.)

1039
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,352
I won't lose you anyway.

1040
00:40:57,952 --> 00:41:01,592
So don't even think about running away.

1041
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:03,182
I won't lose you, indeed.

1042
00:41:03,782 --> 00:41:06,622
Even though Jae Hyun has 10 dollars on his back,

1043
00:41:06,622 --> 00:41:08,722
I don't have any intention to take off his name tag at all.

1044
00:41:08,752 --> 00:41:10,552
(I'm now with Soo Bin, you know.)

1045
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:14,452
I didn't expect this mission would turn out this way.

1046
00:41:19,452 --> 00:41:21,622
This is making me crazy. Thank you.

1047
00:41:21,622 --> 00:41:22,782
(Why is the phone ringing at this moment?)

1048
00:41:23,452 --> 00:41:25,222
- Hello, Jong Kook. - Where are you, Kwang Soo?

1049
00:41:26,422 --> 00:41:27,782
I'm now...

1050
00:41:28,852 --> 00:41:32,822
with a lady, so I can't talk to you for long on the phone.

1051
00:41:33,152 --> 00:41:34,252
You mean her?

1052
00:41:35,122 --> 00:41:37,222
Yes. That's what happened.

1053
00:41:38,252 --> 00:41:40,152
I know. Why?

1054
00:41:40,452 --> 00:41:42,552
Jong Kook, she is so...

1055
00:41:43,252 --> 00:41:44,852
No, I'll stop talking.

1056
00:41:45,452 --> 00:41:47,052
She might be shy.

1057
00:41:47,822 --> 00:41:49,092
Okay. I see.

1058
00:41:49,322 --> 00:41:51,422
(She holds Kwang Soo's hand.)

1059
00:41:51,452 --> 00:41:52,682
Okay. I see.

1060
00:41:52,682 --> 00:41:54,152
(He's laughing.)

1061
00:41:54,152 --> 00:41:57,452
She's holding my hand right now.

1062
00:41:59,182 --> 00:42:01,252
- Why? - I'll hold it for you.

1063
00:42:01,282 --> 00:42:02,552
Now, let go of it.

1064
00:42:02,552 --> 00:42:05,822
(They're holding each other's hand tight.)

1065
00:42:07,252 --> 00:42:10,052
(It's raining in Seoul,)

1066
00:42:10,052 --> 00:42:13,422
(but the sun has appeared in Kwang Soo's heart.)

1067
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:15,752
Wait.

1068
00:42:15,752 --> 00:42:16,952
(He's falling down.)

1069
00:42:20,452 --> 00:42:23,092
(I knew something nice would happen today.)

1070
00:42:23,092 --> 00:42:24,882
(He can't help but smile.)

1071
00:42:25,882 --> 00:42:27,352
I didn't know this would happen.

1072
00:42:28,182 --> 00:42:30,352
If I had known, I would have put on cologne.

1073
00:42:31,092 --> 00:42:32,352
You didn't give me any notice.

1074
00:42:32,352 --> 00:42:33,682
(In fact, love comes without notice.)

1075
00:42:34,352 --> 00:42:35,952
Do we have another mission?

1076
00:42:35,952 --> 00:42:36,952
No.

1077
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:39,752
Your eyes are so...

1078
00:42:41,182 --> 00:42:42,522
(She stares at him.)

1079
00:42:43,092 --> 00:42:44,682
I don't usually say something like this,

1080
00:42:45,152 --> 00:42:46,322
but I'm captivated by you.

1081
00:42:48,522 --> 00:42:50,652
(He can't keep his mouth closed.)

1082
00:42:51,722 --> 00:42:53,282
I'm happy to be teamed up with you.

1083
00:42:53,282 --> 00:42:54,722
(He laughs in happiness.)

1084
00:42:57,722 --> 00:43:00,222
What should I do? I want to give everything to you.

1085
00:43:01,322 --> 00:43:02,982
What's this? Do you need this?

1086
00:43:02,982 --> 00:43:04,522
- Do you want this? - I have one, too.

1087
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:10,482
It's nice to do this on a rainy day.

1088
00:43:13,022 --> 00:43:16,322
I think they're going across Han River.

1089
00:43:16,622 --> 00:43:18,682
We can't cross the river here.

1090
00:43:18,952 --> 00:43:20,822
I'll give an urgent notice.

1091
00:43:20,822 --> 00:43:22,852
Since Blackmon cleared the mission,

1092
00:43:22,852 --> 00:43:25,752
your location will be revealed to the hunters for 10 minutes.

1093
00:43:25,852 --> 00:43:27,152
My location?

1094
00:43:27,152 --> 00:43:29,252
Your GPS is turned on now.

1095
00:43:30,222 --> 00:43:31,452
This is crazy.

1096
00:43:31,882 --> 00:43:34,552
- Is it only me or all of us? - All of you.

1097
00:43:34,852 --> 00:43:36,182
(Five minutes ago)

1098
00:43:36,182 --> 00:43:37,182
That's what happened.

1099
00:43:37,622 --> 00:43:39,122
(Blackmon's hidden mission is to hold his hand.)

1100
00:43:39,122 --> 00:43:41,452
(If she clears the mission, the locations are sent to the hunters.)

1101
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,722
(She's looking for the right moment.)

1102
00:43:43,652 --> 00:43:46,022
(Without knowing anything, he's just so excited.)

1103
00:43:46,952 --> 00:43:47,952
Why?

1104
00:43:48,052 --> 00:43:50,322
I'll hold it for you. Now, let go of it.

1105
00:43:50,322 --> 00:43:52,722
(She holds his hand tightly.)

1106
00:43:54,222 --> 00:43:55,352
Wait.

1107
00:43:57,052 --> 00:43:59,552
(Blackmon Soo Bin completes her hidden mission.)

1108
00:44:00,852 --> 00:44:03,752
(Hunters got the locations of the members.)

1109
00:44:04,182 --> 00:44:06,752
Where is exit number three?

1110
00:44:07,822 --> 00:44:08,852
Gosh.

1111
00:44:09,252 --> 00:44:11,522
(What did he see?)

1112
00:44:12,382 --> 00:44:14,452
(The hunters are gathering near the members.)

1113
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,522
(They are Jong Kook Hunters.)

1114
00:44:17,882 --> 00:44:20,452
(They are coming closer because his location was sent to them.)

1115
00:44:20,452 --> 00:44:22,322
How did they know that I'm near exit number three?

1116
00:44:23,382 --> 00:44:25,352
(Here are Seok Jin Hunters, too.)

1117
00:44:25,352 --> 00:44:29,182
They're wearing purple. They're looking for Seok Jin.

1118
00:44:29,352 --> 00:44:32,522
Incredible. They are everywhere.

1119
00:44:32,522 --> 00:44:33,952
(They gather near the building where Seok Jin is.)

1120
00:44:33,952 --> 00:44:35,082
This is a problem.

1121
00:44:35,752 --> 00:44:37,352
- Hello. - Hello, Seok Jin.

1122
00:44:37,352 --> 00:44:39,022
- Where are you? - Where are you?

1123
00:44:39,252 --> 00:44:42,022
I'm near the parking lot of the building.

1124
00:44:42,022 --> 00:44:44,152
I'm also heading towards there,

1125
00:44:44,152 --> 00:44:46,752
but there are a lot of people who are looking for you.

1126
00:44:46,822 --> 00:44:48,422
- Where? - Here...

1127
00:44:48,422 --> 00:44:50,182
There are some in front of a convenience store, too.

1128
00:44:50,182 --> 00:44:51,182
Near the building?

1129
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,352
They are everywhere.

1130
00:44:53,352 --> 00:44:54,922
Then I shouldn't be there.

1131
00:44:54,982 --> 00:44:57,222
Gosh, there are tons of them here.

1132
00:44:57,552 --> 00:45:00,782
You'll be in danger here.

1133
00:45:01,652 --> 00:45:03,522
While shooting Running Man,

1134
00:45:03,982 --> 00:45:05,352
I have a keen sense now.

1135
00:45:05,352 --> 00:45:07,452
Rock Hyun, Chan Young and Min Woo are passing...

1136
00:45:07,822 --> 00:45:09,982
by the building you're in.

1137
00:45:09,982 --> 00:45:12,252
Get out now quickly. There is nobody.

1138
00:45:12,252 --> 00:45:14,422
- Okay. - Get out quickly.

1139
00:45:15,282 --> 00:45:17,652
- There is nobody now. Come quickly. - I see.

1140
00:45:17,652 --> 00:45:19,952
(Will he escape with the help of Jae Seok?)

1141
00:45:20,682 --> 00:45:22,452
There he is. He's walking towards us.

1142
00:45:22,722 --> 00:45:25,522
He's doing his best to run, but it looks like he's walking.

1143
00:45:26,952 --> 00:45:27,952
- Come quickly. - Gosh.

1144
00:45:28,152 --> 00:45:29,922
- Because of Kwang Soo... - Seok Jin.

1145
00:45:29,922 --> 00:45:31,622
- Make it quick. - The phone keeps ringing.

1146
00:45:31,622 --> 00:45:34,152
They are here again. Move quickly.

1147
00:45:34,152 --> 00:45:36,552
(What do you mean they are here?)

1148
00:45:37,522 --> 00:45:38,522
What's wrong?

1149
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,682
(Here come Seok Jin Hunters.)

1150
00:45:41,682 --> 00:45:42,782
My goodness.

1151
00:45:44,152 --> 00:45:45,382
Hey, Jae Seok.

1152
00:45:46,752 --> 00:45:48,852
- Run fast, Seok Jin. - What did you do to me?

1153
00:45:50,322 --> 00:45:53,522
I was foolish to trust you. What did you do to me?

1154
00:45:53,522 --> 00:45:55,552
Catch him.

1155
00:45:55,722 --> 00:45:57,682
Calm down.

1156
00:45:57,682 --> 00:45:59,382
Please calm down.

1157
00:45:59,622 --> 00:46:01,682
What should I do?

1158
00:46:02,052 --> 00:46:03,882
Sorry, Seok Jin. I didn't do it on purpose.

1159
00:46:03,982 --> 00:46:05,852
- You brat. - I didn't know at all, either.

1160
00:46:05,852 --> 00:46:08,382
- What do you mean? - Trust me.

1161
00:46:08,422 --> 00:46:09,652
(Seok Jin becomes the first to get eliminated.)

1162
00:46:09,652 --> 00:46:11,182
- Hey. - I didn't betray you.

1163
00:46:12,052 --> 00:46:14,782
You made a deal with him, right?

1164
00:46:14,782 --> 00:46:17,482
No, we didn't. It was just the three of us.

1165
00:46:17,652 --> 00:46:19,282
Please tell him I'm innocent.

1166
00:46:22,052 --> 00:46:24,252
There are people wearing pink.

1167
00:46:25,752 --> 00:46:28,322
They're wearing pink shirts. Pink hunters are...

1168
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:29,982
after Kwang Soo, aren't they?

1169
00:46:30,152 --> 00:46:31,552
Shall I give them a ride?

1170
00:46:33,552 --> 00:46:36,122
There they are again.

1171
00:46:36,422 --> 00:46:37,482
Guys,

1172
00:46:38,182 --> 00:46:39,822
do you want to go to the Korea National Assembly Building?

1173
00:46:39,822 --> 00:46:41,622
- We're going there. - Okay.

1174
00:46:41,752 --> 00:46:42,782
Then...

1175
00:46:43,422 --> 00:46:44,682
I'll give you a ride.

1176
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,422
- Really? - Let's go to get Kwang Soo.

1177
00:46:46,422 --> 00:46:48,382
- Great. - Good.

1178
00:46:48,952 --> 00:46:50,282
Sit in the front seat, too.

1179
00:46:51,152 --> 00:46:53,682
- Thank you. - Okay.

1180
00:46:53,682 --> 00:46:55,122
Please remember I did something nice to you.

1181
00:46:55,752 --> 00:46:57,082
Do you have only one name tag left?

1182
00:46:57,082 --> 00:46:58,322
I only have the last one.

1183
00:46:59,552 --> 00:47:00,922
- Let's go straight down the road. - Excuse me?

1184
00:47:01,682 --> 00:47:02,822
(The hidden mission is to ride on Kwang Soo's back.)

1185
00:47:02,822 --> 00:47:04,052
(If she clears the mission, the locations are sent to the hunters.)

1186
00:47:04,052 --> 00:47:05,622
What are you doing, Soo Bin?

1187
00:47:06,452 --> 00:47:07,782
- Let's get inside anyway. - Okay.

1188
00:47:07,782 --> 00:47:09,152
Too many people are after you.

1189
00:47:09,752 --> 00:47:10,882
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1190
00:47:10,952 --> 00:47:11,952
By the way,

1191
00:47:12,552 --> 00:47:14,952
- my legs hurt. - Right. You must be too tired.

1192
00:47:14,952 --> 00:47:15,952
We can't keep walking like this.

1193
00:47:16,752 --> 00:47:17,922
I can't walk any more.

1194
00:47:18,722 --> 00:47:21,722
(She's acting so cute.)

1195
00:47:23,482 --> 00:47:24,522
I...

1196
00:47:24,522 --> 00:47:26,122
(He's blushing.)

1197
00:47:28,752 --> 00:47:31,382
Should I give you a piggyback ride? What should I do?

1198
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:32,682
- Are you okay with it? - Of course.

1199
00:47:32,682 --> 00:47:34,352
- It could hurt your back. - Don't worry.

1200
00:47:34,582 --> 00:47:35,622
What's going on all of a sudden?

1201
00:47:35,952 --> 00:47:38,922
I came out early this morning. My legs hurt too much.

1202
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,982
(Kwang Soo gets tricked into giving her a piggyback ride.)

1203
00:47:40,982 --> 00:47:43,122
I've never done this before.

1204
00:47:43,122 --> 00:47:44,652
(The locations of the members are sent back to the hunters.)

1205
00:47:44,652 --> 00:47:47,052
- Am I heavy? - Not at all.

1206
00:47:48,682 --> 00:47:49,822
Wait.

1207
00:47:50,522 --> 00:47:54,352
(Did Kwang Soo finally notice something suspicious?)

1208
00:47:54,682 --> 00:47:56,852
I had no idea you were on my back.

1209
00:47:56,922 --> 00:47:58,852
(I had no idea you were on my back.)

1210
00:47:58,882 --> 00:48:01,952
- You're so light. - I think you can put me down now.

1211
00:48:01,952 --> 00:48:03,152
You want me to put you down now?

1212
00:48:04,422 --> 00:48:06,052
You're volatile, aren't you?

1213
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:09,782
Thank you.

1214
00:48:09,782 --> 00:48:12,152
- No problem. Let's go. - Okay.

1215
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,452
- Everywhere's closed. - I know.

1216
00:48:17,682 --> 00:48:19,522
(Kwang Soo spotted the hunters approaching him.)

1217
00:48:20,122 --> 00:48:21,782
- Soo Bin, do you have a mission? - What mission?

1218
00:48:21,782 --> 00:48:23,882
I think they're tracking your GPS.

1219
00:48:23,882 --> 00:48:26,922
- Where am I doing the mission? - Let me take a look.

1220
00:48:27,852 --> 00:48:30,252
If you succeed the mission, you can turn the GPS off.

1221
00:48:30,252 --> 00:48:31,552
You have to turn it off.

1222
00:48:32,022 --> 00:48:34,682
(That's not what you should worry about right now.)

1223
00:48:34,682 --> 00:48:36,752
We met here, right?

1224
00:48:36,922 --> 00:48:38,852
- We have to go there. - There's Ankara Park.

1225
00:48:38,852 --> 00:48:40,522
It's either of these two spots.

1226
00:48:40,522 --> 00:48:44,152
- What should we do? - Let's take the taxi over there.

1227
00:48:44,252 --> 00:48:45,922
- We can't do that. - They don't have our number.

1228
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:47,322
Who's that?

1229
00:48:47,322 --> 00:48:49,722
It's Kwang Soo. You have to hide.

1230
00:48:49,722 --> 00:48:51,452
Keep hiding and sneak out later.

1231
00:48:51,722 --> 00:48:53,182
The taxi is taken.

1232
00:48:53,552 --> 00:48:54,622
What?

1233
00:48:57,322 --> 00:48:58,552
Oh, no!

1234
00:48:58,822 --> 00:49:00,052
(Screaming)

1235
00:49:00,052 --> 00:49:02,882
Open the door. Get off now.

1236
00:49:02,882 --> 00:49:04,422
Start running.

1237
00:49:05,482 --> 00:49:06,682
Oh, no!

1238
00:49:06,682 --> 00:49:08,882
(He left his umbrella with her in the middle of everything.)

1239
00:49:08,882 --> 00:49:10,322
No!

1240
00:49:10,752 --> 00:49:12,182
Soo Bin!

1241
00:49:12,852 --> 00:49:14,182
Soo Bin!

1242
00:49:14,682 --> 00:49:16,752
Hello. Come this way.

1243
00:49:16,882 --> 00:49:19,682
- Come this way? - What?

1244
00:49:19,682 --> 00:49:22,382
Come this way. Let's go.

1245
00:49:22,682 --> 00:49:24,022
It's nice to see you.

1246
00:49:24,452 --> 00:49:25,452
Here you go.

1247
00:49:26,482 --> 00:49:27,782
- Soo Bin! - Where are you going?

1248
00:49:27,982 --> 00:49:29,352
Have you seen Blackmon?

1249
00:49:29,422 --> 00:49:30,552
Soo Bin!

1250
00:49:30,552 --> 00:49:32,352
Kwang Soo, have you seen Blackmon?

1251
00:49:32,422 --> 00:49:33,722
No.

1252
00:49:34,552 --> 00:49:36,782
(Gary thinks Kwang Soo is being chased by the hunters.)

1253
00:49:36,782 --> 00:49:38,182
That could happen to me.

1254
00:49:39,082 --> 00:49:40,822
Soo Bin!

1255
00:49:40,822 --> 00:49:42,722
(Kwang Soo is an idiot.)

1256
00:49:42,722 --> 00:49:44,322
Soo Bin!

1257
00:49:44,322 --> 00:49:46,422
(Kwang Soo is an idiot who doesn't know anything other than Soo Bin.)

1258
00:49:46,422 --> 00:49:47,722
(He doesn't even know Soo Bin actually tricked him.)

1259
00:49:47,722 --> 00:49:49,382
I'm sorry, Soo Bin.

1260
00:49:49,382 --> 00:49:51,522
(He doesn't even know Soo Bin actually tricked him.)

1261
00:49:51,522 --> 00:49:52,752
Soo Bin!

1262
00:49:53,482 --> 00:49:56,352
Let's see how things pan out.

1263
00:49:56,352 --> 00:49:58,482
I have to catch Kwang Soo.

1264
00:49:58,782 --> 00:50:01,022
Do you want some coffee?

1265
00:50:01,022 --> 00:50:03,452
- Are we going to stay in the taxi? - This is a taxi interview.

1266
00:50:03,722 --> 00:50:05,022
Hello.

1267
00:50:05,022 --> 00:50:07,552
- Hello. - Hello, Soo Bin.

1268
00:50:07,722 --> 00:50:10,882
I wonder if you're the real deal.

1269
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,382
I wonder.

1270
00:50:12,722 --> 00:50:14,182
I think Jae Hyun is...

1271
00:50:14,182 --> 00:50:16,152
(Soo Bin says Jae Hyun is...)

1272
00:50:16,152 --> 00:50:17,422
the real deal.

1273
00:50:17,422 --> 00:50:19,322
(Soo Bin says Jae Hyun is 10 dollars.)

1274
00:50:20,782 --> 00:50:23,222
I've got nothing.

1275
00:50:24,552 --> 00:50:27,352
I'll be no use to you.

1276
00:50:28,682 --> 00:50:31,182
You know what? I'm not a good liar.

1277
00:50:34,122 --> 00:50:36,552
Maybe I'll take my name tag off to find out.

1278
00:50:37,352 --> 00:50:40,922
You don't have to do that. I said I'm not a good liar.

1279
00:50:41,582 --> 00:50:43,122
I don't trust actors and actresses any more.

1280
00:50:43,122 --> 00:50:45,322
Especially the ones that appear in Running Man.

1281
00:50:45,322 --> 00:50:46,722
The actresses...

1282
00:50:47,322 --> 00:50:49,822
look so innocent.

1283
00:50:50,252 --> 00:50:53,082
You have no idea what's inside.

1284
00:50:55,782 --> 00:50:57,582
- Hey, Ji Hyo. - Where are you?

1285
00:50:58,322 --> 00:51:00,422
- Aren't you at Hangang Park? - Hey.

1286
00:51:00,952 --> 00:51:04,122
I heard you're busy chasing after name tags with Blackmon.

1287
00:51:04,152 --> 00:51:06,722
I'm on a run right now. I managed to escape.

1288
00:51:06,722 --> 00:51:09,552
Haha is after me.

1289
00:51:09,752 --> 00:51:12,182
(He sneezes.)

1290
00:51:12,182 --> 00:51:14,022
- Is that Haha? - Yes.

1291
00:51:14,952 --> 00:51:16,122
Okay, bye.

1292
00:51:16,582 --> 00:51:18,452
Can you tell him that...

1293
00:51:18,452 --> 00:51:19,822
I won't be nice to him any longer?

1294
00:51:19,822 --> 00:51:22,322
I'll send him your message.

1295
00:51:23,252 --> 00:51:26,282
- Okay. - Nobody knows that I got caught.

1296
00:51:26,782 --> 00:51:29,182
Why did you have to sneeze?

1297
00:51:29,182 --> 00:51:30,252
(Is this how you're going to behave?)

1298
00:51:30,252 --> 00:51:32,722
Gosh, you're making me nervous.

1299
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:34,722
Nobody has a clue that I got caught.

1300
00:51:34,852 --> 00:51:38,222
Kwang Soo is baiting me.

1301
00:51:38,282 --> 00:51:39,952
Did he say something about Haha?

1302
00:51:39,952 --> 00:51:41,982
(Ji Hyo tries to get Haha on the phone.)

1303
00:51:41,982 --> 00:51:43,622
- Hey, Ji Hyo. - Haha.

1304
00:51:44,922 --> 00:51:47,152
Are you chasing Kwang Soo right now?

1305
00:51:47,152 --> 00:51:49,982
(Haha is putting on an act to hide his possession of Soo Bin.)

1306
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:51,882
Did you talk to him?

1307
00:51:51,882 --> 00:51:53,782
(He sneezes loudly.)

1308
00:51:53,782 --> 00:51:55,182
Who was that?

1309
00:51:56,052 --> 00:51:57,522
- Who was that? - Gosh.

1310
00:51:58,082 --> 00:51:59,152
Who was that?

1311
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:00,522
I'll call you later.

1312
00:52:01,622 --> 00:52:03,652
- I'm right here. - Who's there?

1313
00:52:04,082 --> 00:52:05,482
I got caught.

1314
00:52:06,782 --> 00:52:08,222
Excuse me.

1315
00:52:08,852 --> 00:52:10,952
(Ji Hyo, Gary and Jong Kook)

1316
00:52:10,952 --> 00:52:12,622
You're a lot of help.

1317
00:52:13,152 --> 00:52:14,952
You should take a right.

1318
00:52:15,482 --> 00:52:18,552
He should be here somewhere.

1319
00:52:18,952 --> 00:52:20,252
Sir.

1320
00:52:21,152 --> 00:52:23,822
Please make a right turn over there.

1321
00:52:25,252 --> 00:52:27,222
There she is. That's Ji Hyo.

1322
00:52:28,622 --> 00:52:32,152
(He found Ji Hyo in middle of the street.)

1323
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:33,452
Can you make a left?

1324
00:52:34,282 --> 00:52:36,282
Pull over please.

1325
00:52:36,282 --> 00:52:37,322
(I have to get off without her noticing.)

1326
00:52:39,582 --> 00:52:41,422
Ji Hyo caught Blackmon.

1327
00:52:41,922 --> 00:52:43,882
Ji Hyo caught Blackmon.

1328
00:52:43,882 --> 00:52:45,952
(Did he make eye contact with Jae Hyun?)

1329
00:52:47,782 --> 00:52:51,252
We don't know when the other members will come here.

1330
00:52:51,252 --> 00:52:53,652
(He sneaks his way around.)

1331
00:52:55,252 --> 00:52:57,082
(He's after Blackmon Jae Hyun.)

1332
00:52:57,082 --> 00:52:58,222
Yes.

1333
00:52:58,522 --> 00:52:59,552
Yes.

1334
00:53:01,452 --> 00:53:02,652
Yes.

1335
00:53:03,182 --> 00:53:06,152
(Ji Hyo is completely vulnerable.)

1336
00:53:06,152 --> 00:53:07,922
What's going on over there?

1337
00:53:08,882 --> 00:53:10,922
Go.

1338
00:53:10,922 --> 00:53:12,552
Hey, Ji Hyo.

1339
00:53:12,552 --> 00:53:14,122
(It's Jong Kook.)

1340
00:53:15,852 --> 00:53:16,882
I got you.

1341
00:53:17,982 --> 00:53:19,022
There.

1342
00:53:19,022 --> 00:53:21,482
(Jong Kook is the new master of Blackmon Jae Hyun.)

1343
00:53:22,252 --> 00:53:23,822
(Gary runs back the way he came from.)

1344
00:53:23,822 --> 00:53:25,122
What is this?

1345
00:53:25,652 --> 00:53:27,352
- What's going on? - How am I supposed to catch them?

1346
00:53:27,352 --> 00:53:30,352
- What's going on? - I have to escort him.

1347
00:53:30,482 --> 00:53:32,722
I have to escort him, right?

1348
00:53:33,152 --> 00:53:34,782
I have to escort him.

1349
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:37,952
- Hurry. - Where did Jong Kook come from?

1350
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:40,322
Gosh.

1351
00:53:40,322 --> 00:53:41,582
I was a second late.

1352
00:53:41,582 --> 00:53:43,352
Come say hi to the members.

1353
00:53:43,352 --> 00:53:45,482
(Take a look at my Blackmon.)

1354
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:48,182
- We have to hurry. - Can you start the car?

1355
00:53:48,182 --> 00:53:51,222
Please start the car. He's scary.

1356
00:53:51,822 --> 00:53:53,552
He's so scary.

1357
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,082
Jong Kook's timing was perfect.

1358
00:53:56,222 --> 00:53:59,382
Thank you, Jae Hyun.

1359
00:53:59,682 --> 00:54:01,722
I hope you didn't get too wet from the rain.

1360
00:54:01,722 --> 00:54:05,222
(Running Man Go, current situation)

1361
00:54:05,282 --> 00:54:06,422
He's scary.

1362
00:54:06,982 --> 00:54:08,752
He's so scary.

1363
00:54:08,752 --> 00:54:11,122
(They're still traumatised by Jong Kook.)

1364
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,752
- Hey, Haha. - What's going on?

1365
00:54:13,882 --> 00:54:16,482
Jong Kook just...

1366
00:54:16,682 --> 00:54:18,282
took Jae Hyun from me.

1367
00:54:18,382 --> 00:54:20,682
Jae Hyun said he's zero dollars.

1368
00:54:20,982 --> 00:54:22,422
- Did he? - Yes.

1369
00:54:22,422 --> 00:54:23,622
(Does that mean Soo Bin is 10 dollars?)

1370
00:54:23,822 --> 00:54:26,222
Fill me in with the current situation.

1371
00:54:26,252 --> 00:54:28,782
Gary and Jong Kook came at me at the same time.

1372
00:54:29,322 --> 00:54:32,522
You have to start taking people out.

1373
00:54:32,652 --> 00:54:34,652
We won't go near you.

1374
00:54:34,652 --> 00:54:36,522
Okay, sounds good.

1375
00:54:37,252 --> 00:54:39,482
(Wait a minute.)

1376
00:54:39,482 --> 00:54:40,982
(He's brainstorming his next move.)

1377
00:54:40,982 --> 00:54:43,322
I know what I have to do.

1378
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:45,022
I'm going to turn off the GPS.

1379
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:47,052
Take a taxi again...

1380
00:54:47,682 --> 00:54:49,452
and when they come for me, I'll take them out.

1381
00:54:50,122 --> 00:54:52,022
(You're going to take off the members' name tags?)

1382
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,422
(Taking off Blackmon's name tag gives you possession of it.)

1383
00:54:55,422 --> 00:54:58,052
(The person with Blackmon can attack other members.)

1384
00:54:58,052 --> 00:55:01,022
Can you take us to Hangang Park?

1385
00:55:01,422 --> 00:55:02,782
He's going to Han River.

1386
00:55:02,782 --> 00:55:05,822
- Who? - Let's catch Haha's Blackmon.

1387
00:55:05,982 --> 00:55:07,452
Yes, let's go for him.

1388
00:55:07,452 --> 00:55:08,452
(Alliance means nothing to them.)

1389
00:55:10,022 --> 00:55:11,722
He's going to Han River.

1390
00:55:11,722 --> 00:55:14,082
(Other members are also tracking him down.)

1391
00:55:14,082 --> 00:55:16,352
Haha is with Soo Bin?

1392
00:55:16,552 --> 00:55:20,552
(Soo Bin, what are you doing there?)

1393
00:55:20,882 --> 00:55:25,052
Can you wait for us here?

1394
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:28,852
(Haha and Soo Bin arrive at the place for the mission.)

1395
00:55:28,852 --> 00:55:29,982
They're not here, right?

1396
00:55:30,882 --> 00:55:31,952
Where is the mission?

1397
00:55:32,882 --> 00:55:34,152
There it is. This is it.

1398
00:55:34,152 --> 00:55:36,822
This is it. That's the flag.

1399
00:55:40,682 --> 00:55:42,782
- This is the place. - Can you pull over?

1400
00:55:42,782 --> 00:55:44,152
You can pull over right here.

1401
00:55:44,152 --> 00:55:47,052
This is the plan. I'll go on first.

1402
00:55:47,282 --> 00:55:48,552
You just follow my lead.

1403
00:55:49,182 --> 00:55:51,752
(Everyone is closing up to Haha.)

1404
00:55:52,952 --> 00:55:54,222
Let's get it done fast.

1405
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:56,082
- This is it. - Okay.

1406
00:55:56,082 --> 00:55:58,382
- Is this it? - Yes.

1407
00:55:58,582 --> 00:56:00,352
Let's get a slice of cheese to go with it.

1408
00:56:00,352 --> 00:56:02,622
This is it.

1409
00:56:02,622 --> 00:56:03,882
Where's gimbap?

1410
00:56:03,922 --> 00:56:06,382
I'm so nervous.

1411
00:56:06,382 --> 00:56:08,922
Why isn't it cooking?

1412
00:56:09,682 --> 00:56:11,052
I should cross.

1413
00:56:11,052 --> 00:56:12,122
(I can smell Blackmon from here.)

1414
00:56:12,122 --> 00:56:13,482
He's down there.

1415
00:56:13,922 --> 00:56:18,182
(Haha Hunters are also heading towards Haha.)

1416
00:56:21,452 --> 00:56:24,622
(He's on a lookout.)

1417
00:56:28,082 --> 00:56:29,352
Gary's coming.

1418
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:31,182
(Gary's coming.)

1419
00:56:32,752 --> 00:56:33,922
Hey there.

1420
00:56:33,922 --> 00:56:35,722
(Let me take a look at your Blackmon.)

1421
00:56:36,182 --> 00:56:38,582
- Are you with her? - What?

1422
00:56:38,582 --> 00:56:39,822
Hello.

1423
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:42,022
You can take me out, right?

1424
00:56:42,222 --> 00:56:43,682
Catch Gary.

1425
00:56:43,882 --> 00:56:45,422
I said catch Gary.

1426
00:56:45,422 --> 00:56:47,982
I won't go for you. Just catch Gary.

1427
00:56:48,882 --> 00:56:51,122
I won't go after you. Please catch Gary.

1428
00:56:52,022 --> 00:56:54,752
(I'm not falling for that.)

1429
00:56:55,222 --> 00:56:58,382
(Gary joins her.)

1430
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:00,552
Let's get started. Let's eat.

1431
00:57:00,552 --> 00:57:02,552
- Haha. - This is the mission.

1432
00:57:03,352 --> 00:57:05,152
This is insane.

1433
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,452
What is this?

1434
00:57:07,782 --> 00:57:09,082
What is this?

1435
00:57:10,982 --> 00:57:12,822
Hello.

1436
00:57:12,822 --> 00:57:14,052
(Blackmon Soo Bin escapes voluntarily.)

1437
00:57:14,482 --> 00:57:16,352
- Hello. - Can you take it off?

1438
00:57:16,852 --> 00:57:18,822
(The master of Blackmon Soo Bin changes unexpectedly.)

1439
00:57:18,822 --> 00:57:20,352
What's going on?

1440
00:57:20,652 --> 00:57:21,782
(Gary can now attack other members.)

1441
00:57:23,882 --> 00:57:24,882
Wait, where did she go?

1442
00:57:24,882 --> 00:57:26,822
Soo Bin!

1443
00:57:27,022 --> 00:57:30,182
If you take mine off...

1444
00:57:30,282 --> 00:57:32,682
(Kwang Soo arrives at the middle of the chaos.)

1445
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:35,822
(I heard you're giving out a free Blackmon.)

1446
00:57:35,822 --> 00:57:37,782
I become your Blackmon.

1447
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:41,152
(Will Gary end up with taking over Soo Bin?)

1448
00:57:42,452 --> 00:57:44,152
(Kwang Soo is now in possession of Soo Bin.)

1449
00:57:44,152 --> 00:57:47,352
(Kwang Soo can attack Gary now.)

1450
00:57:47,452 --> 00:57:48,582
I got it!

1451
00:57:48,582 --> 00:57:51,352
(Gary has one name tag remaining.)

1452
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:53,882
Kwang Soo, I wasn't going to go for you.

1453
00:57:54,052 --> 00:57:55,522
- That's nonsense. - He's lying.

1454
00:57:55,952 --> 00:57:57,952
- Goodbye. - He's such a liar.

1455
00:57:57,952 --> 00:57:59,082
Come on, let's go.

1456
00:58:00,022 --> 00:58:01,322
We're going to follow you.

1457
00:58:01,322 --> 00:58:02,382
This is not looking good.

1458
00:58:05,522 --> 00:58:07,082
- Hello. - Hello.

1459
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:12,682
(Sneaky Jae Seok ambushes them.)

1460
00:58:14,322 --> 00:58:16,452
(He bites Kwang Soo.)

1461
00:58:16,622 --> 00:58:18,322
Get in quickly.

1462
00:58:18,752 --> 00:58:21,252
(Gary and Ji Hyo join the second Blackmon War.)

1463
00:58:21,382 --> 00:58:23,382
Rip it off quickly.

1464
00:58:23,522 --> 00:58:24,582
- Hold on. - Soo Bin!

1465
00:58:24,582 --> 00:58:26,522
- Wait! - No, Soo Bin!

1466
00:58:27,152 --> 00:58:28,222
No, Soo Bin.

1467
00:58:28,222 --> 00:58:30,082
Let me go!

1468
00:58:30,482 --> 00:58:31,552
(He rips Gary's name tag.)

1469
00:58:32,322 --> 00:58:34,582
(Gary is completely out.)

1470
00:58:34,622 --> 00:58:36,422
(Whose is this?)

1471
00:58:36,422 --> 00:58:37,622
Let me go!

1472
00:58:37,622 --> 00:58:41,352
(Jae Seok rips Kwang Soo's name tag that was attached to Soo Bin.)

1473
00:58:41,552 --> 00:58:44,252
(Jae Seok can now attack other members.)

1474
00:58:45,452 --> 00:58:47,422
I'm sorry, Sir.

1475
00:58:47,652 --> 00:58:49,482
Hello, Soo Bin. Long day, isn't it?

1476
00:58:49,952 --> 00:58:51,952
Let's go, Soo Bin.

1477
00:58:53,452 --> 00:58:55,422
Lock from inside, Soo Bin.

1478
00:58:56,022 --> 00:58:57,122
Lock the door.

1479
00:58:57,382 --> 00:58:58,482
Hurry.

1480
00:58:58,482 --> 00:58:59,922
(I'm ripping a name tag before I go.)

1481
00:59:00,382 --> 00:59:02,582
(The hyenas are after Soo Bin.)

1482
00:59:02,582 --> 00:59:03,752
Close the door.

1483
00:59:05,022 --> 00:59:06,122
Hello.

1484
00:59:07,352 --> 00:59:08,352
(She unlocks the door.)

1485
00:59:08,352 --> 00:59:09,422
Are you kidding me?

1486
00:59:09,722 --> 00:59:13,352
(They open up the door with the help of the driver's seat.)

1487
00:59:13,852 --> 00:59:15,952
(She screams.)

1488
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:19,222
(This just in. There are zombies after Blackmon near Han River.)

1489
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,852
Help me!

1490
00:59:20,852 --> 00:59:23,122
- Take it off. - Help me!

1491
00:59:25,282 --> 00:59:27,052
(Whose hand is this?)

1492
00:59:28,422 --> 00:59:32,952
(Kwang Soo takes back possession of Soo Bin.)

1493
00:59:33,022 --> 00:59:34,452
(Kwang Soo can now attack other members.)

1494
00:59:35,522 --> 00:59:37,622
(She's a total wreck.)

1495
00:59:38,322 --> 00:59:40,852
Soo Bin, don't leave me any more.

1496
00:59:41,122 --> 00:59:42,252
Come here, Ji Hyo.

1497
00:59:43,222 --> 00:59:45,422
Soo Bin, come over here.

1498
00:59:45,552 --> 00:59:47,452
(Don't go anywhere else and stay by me.)

1499
00:59:47,452 --> 00:59:48,752
We have to get out of here.

1500
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,382
Is this how it usually is?

1501
00:59:50,382 --> 00:59:52,152
I'm sorry about everything.

1502
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:54,352
(They are addicted to Blackmon. They're going after it.)

1503
00:59:54,352 --> 00:59:55,382
Here they come.

1504
00:59:56,752 --> 00:59:58,452
Can we come inside for a minute?

1505
00:59:58,952 --> 01:00:00,482
Thank you. Get in here, Soo Bin.

1506
01:00:01,022 --> 01:00:02,922
Come here, Soo Bin! Get in here!

1507
01:00:03,722 --> 01:00:04,882
Hide here.

1508
01:00:04,882 --> 01:00:06,782
(Can I come in, too?)

1509
01:00:06,782 --> 01:00:09,822
Lock the doors!

1510
01:00:11,122 --> 01:00:12,222
(She falls into his arms.)

1511
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:14,722
Go around.

1512
01:00:14,722 --> 01:00:15,752
(Is this a zombie film?)

1513
01:00:15,752 --> 01:00:16,782
Go away.

1514
01:00:17,252 --> 01:00:19,322
Not like this.

1515
01:00:19,752 --> 01:00:21,022
Attack him if you have two name tags.

1516
01:00:21,022 --> 01:00:22,982
I'm going to take you out.

1517
01:00:23,082 --> 01:00:24,952
- I have two. - Oh, no.

1518
01:00:24,952 --> 01:00:27,022
Wait, hold on!

1519
01:00:27,422 --> 01:00:28,722
- Soo Bin! - I got it.

1520
01:00:29,282 --> 01:00:30,552
I got it.

1521
01:00:30,552 --> 01:00:31,982
(Jae Seok takes off Kwang Soo's name tag.)

1522
01:00:31,982 --> 01:00:33,782
I'll hold onto him. Take the name tag off.

1523
01:00:34,222 --> 01:00:35,682
(They plan to take Kwang Soo out.

1524
01:00:36,322 --> 01:00:40,082
(I should get rid of Kwang Soo now that I have the possession.)

1525
01:00:40,082 --> 01:00:41,122
Don't go for me.

1526
01:00:41,122 --> 01:00:45,322
(I'll get going then.)

1527
01:00:46,682 --> 01:00:47,822
Soo Bin!

1528
01:00:49,482 --> 01:00:51,082
(I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.)

1529
01:00:51,082 --> 01:00:53,152
We have to go after him. Come here.

1530
01:00:53,782 --> 01:00:55,822
We have to take him out for sure.

1531
01:00:56,522 --> 01:00:57,722
Soo Bin!

1532
01:00:57,722 --> 01:00:59,552
(I'm sorry I left you all alone with those hyenas.)

1533
01:00:59,552 --> 01:01:00,852
I'm sorry, Soo Bin!

1534
01:01:01,682 --> 01:01:02,752
Soo Bin!

1535
01:01:05,082 --> 01:01:07,252
- Am I heavy? - Not at all.

1536
01:01:07,252 --> 01:01:09,282
She's holding my hand right now.

1537
01:01:09,282 --> 01:01:11,222
(Even though I'm getting married, my feelings for you were true.)

1538
01:01:11,322 --> 01:01:12,682
I'm sorry, Soo Bin!

1539
01:01:12,682 --> 01:01:15,622
(All I can do now is wish her luck with the new owner.)

1540
01:01:15,622 --> 01:01:16,852
Are you well?

1541
01:01:17,652 --> 01:01:19,152
I hope we meet again!

1542
01:01:19,152 --> 01:01:22,052
(Soo Bin, I want you to be happy.)

1543
01:01:22,052 --> 01:01:23,152
Soo Bin!

1544
01:01:25,052 --> 01:01:26,682
Soo Bin, stay safe!

1545
01:01:27,252 --> 01:01:28,622
Where did he go?

1546
01:01:29,782 --> 01:01:30,952
He's going over there.

1547
01:01:30,952 --> 01:01:32,222
(Soo Bin is back in Jae Seok's hands.)

1548
01:01:32,782 --> 01:01:34,452
Soo Bin, stay safe...

1549
01:01:35,282 --> 01:01:36,722
(He gags.)

1550
01:01:36,852 --> 01:01:39,352
(That was a gagging monologue.)

1551
01:01:39,352 --> 01:01:41,422
- Hey. - Chae Soo Bin!

1552
01:01:42,482 --> 01:01:44,122
Get yourself together.

1553
01:01:44,252 --> 01:01:45,452
- Where is she? - Get yourself together.

1554
01:01:45,822 --> 01:01:46,952
- Chae Soo Bin! - You're going to...

1555
01:01:47,452 --> 01:01:49,482
- Pull yourself together. - Soo Bin!

1556
01:01:49,922 --> 01:01:52,052
Are you going through a breakup or something?

1557
01:01:52,322 --> 01:01:54,122
Soo Bin has zero dollars.

1558
01:01:54,522 --> 01:01:55,752
I don't care!

1559
01:01:55,752 --> 01:01:56,952
(Do you think I'm after the prize?)

1560
01:01:56,952 --> 01:01:58,552
- Hey. - I hate Cho Jae Hyun!

1561
01:01:59,222 --> 01:02:00,252
Soo Bin!

1562
01:02:01,822 --> 01:02:03,022
Soo Bin!

1563
01:02:05,152 --> 01:02:06,382
You're a fool in love.

1564
01:02:06,882 --> 01:02:09,652
(He is stupidly in love.)

1565
01:02:09,652 --> 01:02:11,852
- Wake up, you idiot. - This time, it's genuine.

1566
01:02:12,152 --> 01:02:13,282
It's for real this time.

1567
01:02:13,782 --> 01:02:16,122
I get that she's your type of girl,

1568
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:17,982
but she has zero dollars.

1569
01:02:18,682 --> 01:02:20,122
Choose between Sun Bin and Soo Bin.

1570
01:02:20,352 --> 01:02:23,082
He likes those with "Bin" in their names.

1571
01:02:23,152 --> 01:02:26,022
- He fell in love again. - He looks sincere.

1572
01:02:26,152 --> 01:02:28,052
Which one is it?

1573
01:02:28,522 --> 01:02:30,222
You said you liked Sun Bin.

1574
01:02:30,452 --> 01:02:31,522
Kwang Soo.

1575
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:33,152
(Jae Seok can attack other members.)

1576
01:02:33,252 --> 01:02:34,882
I've been through a lot.

1577
01:02:35,152 --> 01:02:36,582
What are you talking about?

1578
01:02:36,582 --> 01:02:38,382
Haha came after me...

1579
01:02:38,382 --> 01:02:40,622
and took Soo Bin from me.

1580
01:02:40,622 --> 01:02:42,482
We should clear things up by getting rid of him.

1581
01:02:42,482 --> 01:02:44,352
I don't even want to do anything today.

1582
01:02:44,352 --> 01:02:45,822
We have to put an end to you.

1583
01:02:45,882 --> 01:02:46,882
Your time is up.

1584
01:02:48,152 --> 01:02:49,482
- Hold still. - Soo Bin!

1585
01:02:49,652 --> 01:02:51,952
- Wait a minute. - Soo Bin!

1586
01:02:51,952 --> 01:02:54,682
- This is a waste of time. - Okay.

1587
01:02:54,682 --> 01:02:56,222
I have zero dollars.

1588
01:02:56,452 --> 01:02:58,152
You have to go after Jae Hyun.

1589
01:02:58,252 --> 01:03:00,152
What are you talking about?

1590
01:03:00,352 --> 01:03:02,252
You're confusing me.

1591
01:03:02,422 --> 01:03:03,852
We don't have time for Kwang Soo.

1592
01:03:03,852 --> 01:03:05,152
I'm...

1593
01:03:05,152 --> 01:03:06,452
Come help me get this off.

1594
01:03:06,452 --> 01:03:08,252
- You're the only one who can. - Soo Bin!

1595
01:03:08,252 --> 01:03:09,682
- Just hold him still. - Soo Bin!

1596
01:03:09,682 --> 01:03:10,782
- You're the only one who can. - Soo Bin!

1597
01:03:10,782 --> 01:03:12,252
- Just hold him still. - Soo Bin!

1598
01:03:12,252 --> 01:03:13,422
You're not going to...

1599
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:14,652
I don't need 10 dollars.

1600
01:03:14,922 --> 01:03:17,152
- You shouldn't fight over me. - Soo Bin!

1601
01:03:17,152 --> 01:03:18,282
Come help me!

1602
01:03:18,282 --> 01:03:19,882
(We have to take matters into our own hands.)

1603
01:03:20,582 --> 01:03:22,482
- Wait. - Take it off.

1604
01:03:22,482 --> 01:03:25,022
- I said take it off. - Okay, just relax.

1605
01:03:25,022 --> 01:03:26,922
Soo Bin.

1606
01:03:26,922 --> 01:03:28,622
- Hurry. I'm counting to 10. - Haha!

1607
01:03:28,622 --> 01:03:30,252
Rip it off and Jae Seok's after!

1608
01:03:30,982 --> 01:03:32,782
Take hers off and Jae Seok's after.

1609
01:03:32,782 --> 01:03:33,922
You...

1610
01:03:33,922 --> 01:03:36,352
- You brought this upon yourself. - Do it.

1611
01:03:38,252 --> 01:03:40,282
Soo Bin! Don't look.

1612
01:03:40,922 --> 01:03:42,752
- Don't look, Soo Bin. - Don't move.

1613
01:03:42,982 --> 01:03:44,352
- Soo Bin! - Go home.

1614
01:03:44,352 --> 01:03:45,852
- Soo Bin! - Please.

1615
01:03:45,852 --> 01:03:47,822
(I don't want you to see me like this.)

1616
01:03:48,182 --> 01:03:50,282
- Soo Bin! - Rip it off.

1617
01:03:50,282 --> 01:03:51,552
You make me sick.

1618
01:03:52,252 --> 01:03:53,652
(Kwang Soo is completely out.)

1619
01:03:53,652 --> 01:03:55,452
You're done now.

1620
01:03:55,852 --> 01:03:56,952
Soo Bin!

1621
01:03:58,022 --> 01:03:59,482
Friends.

1622
01:03:59,782 --> 01:04:01,122
- What's your next move? - I did as you said.

1623
01:04:01,122 --> 01:04:03,082
I listened to you and took Kwang Soo out.

1624
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:05,352
- Be careful. - Stay back.

1625
01:04:05,352 --> 01:04:06,582
- Be careful. - Don't come any closer.

1626
01:04:08,622 --> 01:04:09,622
I regret nothing.

1627
01:04:09,622 --> 01:04:11,852
(He regrets nothing.)

1628
01:04:11,852 --> 01:04:13,222
I'm sorry, Soo Bin!

1629
01:04:13,222 --> 01:04:17,582
(I'll remember you.)

1630
01:04:17,582 --> 01:04:19,152
It's a good weather to love.

1631
01:04:19,152 --> 01:04:22,552
(It's a good weather to love.)

1632
01:04:22,552 --> 01:04:23,952
Don't come any closer.

1633
01:04:24,382 --> 01:04:25,722
- Don't raise your hand. - Okay.

1634
01:04:25,722 --> 01:04:27,882
- I have my hand on her name tag. - I get it.

1635
01:04:28,582 --> 01:04:29,582
I won't come closer.

1636
01:04:29,582 --> 01:04:32,382
Haha, take hers off and take Jae Seok out.

1637
01:04:32,922 --> 01:04:34,052
What are you waiting for?

1638
01:04:34,822 --> 01:04:36,022
Stay out of this.

1639
01:04:36,022 --> 01:04:37,922
Let me share a cab with him.

1640
01:04:37,922 --> 01:04:39,452
We can split the cab.

1641
01:04:39,982 --> 01:04:41,982
Let's all go home together.

1642
01:04:41,982 --> 01:04:43,352
(He's got a point.)

1643
01:04:43,352 --> 01:04:44,482
- He's right. - Don't listen to him.

1644
01:04:44,682 --> 01:04:46,222
- Don't listen to him. - Let me share a cab with him.

1645
01:04:46,222 --> 01:04:47,482
- Wait. - Take it off.

1646
01:04:47,482 --> 01:04:48,622
- Wait. - Take it off.

1647
01:04:48,622 --> 01:04:51,422
(Haha is in possession of Blackmon now.)

1648
01:04:51,422 --> 01:04:52,752
Take Jae Seok out.

1649
01:04:52,752 --> 01:04:54,252
This is insane. Hey, Ji Hyo.

1650
01:04:54,252 --> 01:04:55,982
A ride for two, please.

1651
01:04:56,382 --> 01:04:57,622
We're two people.

1652
01:04:57,982 --> 01:04:59,382
- Pull over here. - Go away.

1653
01:04:59,382 --> 01:05:00,852
- Hey, Ji Hyo. - Is this how you want to play?

1654
01:05:00,852 --> 01:05:02,822
- I said go away. - Ji Hyo.

1655
01:05:02,952 --> 01:05:04,052
Go away.

1656
01:05:04,052 --> 01:05:05,382
Don't come any closer.

1657
01:05:05,552 --> 01:05:06,782
Go away.

1658
01:05:06,852 --> 01:05:08,122
Just rip it off!

1659
01:05:08,652 --> 01:05:12,082
Wait a minute. We should call over Haha Hunters.

1660
01:05:12,282 --> 01:05:13,522
That's the best solution.

1661
01:05:13,982 --> 01:05:15,082
(What did you say?)

1662
01:05:15,082 --> 01:05:17,252
Don't move.

1663
01:05:17,582 --> 01:05:20,152
- I'll do it, too. - Wait a minute.

1664
01:05:20,552 --> 01:05:22,482
Kwang Soo, give me my phone!

1665
01:05:22,482 --> 01:05:24,952
Are there any Jae Seok Hunters near Wonhyo Bridge?

1666
01:05:25,352 --> 01:05:27,752
I don't care what colour. Just send all of them!

1667
01:05:28,152 --> 01:05:30,282
I don't care if you're after Ji Hyo or Jae Seok.

1668
01:05:30,282 --> 01:05:31,452
I knew this would happen.

1669
01:05:31,452 --> 01:05:33,252
- Get them over here. - Blackmon is right here.

1670
01:05:33,252 --> 01:05:35,322
- Send them all. - Haha.

1671
01:05:35,322 --> 01:05:36,722
- Where are you going? - Take it off. Quickly.

1672
01:05:36,722 --> 01:05:37,822
- Don't do that. - Take it off.

1673
01:05:37,822 --> 01:05:39,022
(Ji Hyo can now attack other members.)

1674
01:05:39,022 --> 01:05:40,752
- Why did you do that? - Hey, Seok Jin.

1675
01:05:41,022 --> 01:05:42,182
Good job, Ji Hyo.

1676
01:05:42,182 --> 01:05:44,422
- I have Soo Bin now. - Calm down.

1677
01:05:44,422 --> 01:05:46,782
- We have to get rid of him. - Hold on.

1678
01:05:46,782 --> 01:05:48,382
- Wait. - We have to get rid of him.

1679
01:05:48,382 --> 01:05:49,822
- What's going on? - Take it off.

1680
01:05:51,052 --> 01:05:53,082
- What's going on? - There you go.

1681
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:56,252
- We should at least take one off. - I did it.

1682
01:05:56,322 --> 01:05:58,952
- This is how it should be. - Now, Jae Seok can do the same.

1683
01:05:59,552 --> 01:06:01,122
(There is no alliance here.)

1684
01:06:01,122 --> 01:06:02,152
- Go away. - Get him.

1685
01:06:02,152 --> 01:06:03,482
(They go for Jae Seok this time.)

1686
01:06:03,482 --> 01:06:05,552
- Get him. - I only have one left.

1687
01:06:05,622 --> 01:06:07,252
That's my last one!

1688
01:06:08,052 --> 01:06:10,322
(Jae Seok is completely out.)

1689
01:06:10,452 --> 01:06:12,722
We're bad, aren't we?

1690
01:06:13,222 --> 01:06:14,982
- How could you do that? - We're really bad.

1691
01:06:15,082 --> 01:06:16,552
- I'm sorry, Jae Seok. - How could you?

1692
01:06:17,152 --> 01:06:19,052
I'm sorry. It had to be done.

1693
01:06:19,052 --> 01:06:20,482
- All of you should get ruined! - You scared me.

1694
01:06:20,952 --> 01:06:21,952
All of you!

1695
01:06:22,882 --> 01:06:24,552
- Soo Bin! - Hey, Soo Bin.

1696
01:06:24,552 --> 01:06:25,782
- Good work, Jae Seok. - It's too bad.

1697
01:06:25,782 --> 01:06:27,552
- I have to go now. - I'm sorry, Soo Bin.

1698
01:06:27,882 --> 01:06:30,622
Soo Bin!

1699
01:06:30,622 --> 01:06:32,122
I'll go to your concerts.

1700
01:06:32,122 --> 01:06:33,222
Hey.

1701
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:35,382
You have problems.

1702
01:06:35,852 --> 01:06:37,752
Why are you like this every time?

1703
01:06:38,922 --> 01:06:41,122
Go! Go away!

1704
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:43,722
- I hate you. - You make things so much worse!

1705
01:06:44,022 --> 01:06:46,682
- You ruined everything. - I hope you get ruined as well.

1706
01:06:47,322 --> 01:06:49,652
- I don't want to see you any more. - Gosh.

1707
01:06:50,722 --> 01:06:51,722
This is upsetting.

1708
01:06:52,122 --> 01:06:53,352
- Soo Bin! - Go away.

1709
01:06:53,652 --> 01:06:55,582
(It's been fun, Soo Bin.)

1710
01:06:55,722 --> 01:06:57,622
Everyone, this is...

1711
01:06:57,622 --> 01:06:59,652
Everyone, I didn't end up with her.

1712
01:07:01,422 --> 01:07:03,352
We got an action message from a viewer...

1713
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:06,752
- to Kwang Soo. - An action message?

1714
01:07:06,752 --> 01:07:08,122
Yes, I'll read it for you.

1715
01:07:08,682 --> 01:07:09,722
(He slaps Kwang Soo.)

1716
01:07:10,952 --> 01:07:14,022
I delivered him...

1717
01:07:14,082 --> 01:07:15,952
the message.

1718
01:07:16,422 --> 01:07:18,882
- Thank you for that. - Thanks for you attention.

1719
01:07:18,882 --> 01:07:24,452
Last week, Kwang Soo spent a good time with Song Ji Eun.

1720
01:07:24,552 --> 01:07:29,522
I delivered the message from Song Ji Eun.

1721
01:07:29,522 --> 01:07:31,752
- Is it from Ji Eun? - Yes.

1722
01:07:31,752 --> 01:07:32,752
Thank you, Ji Eun.

1723
01:07:34,482 --> 01:07:35,482
(He slaps him again.)

1724
01:07:35,522 --> 01:07:37,052
All right.

1725
01:07:37,322 --> 01:07:38,482
Whom is this from?

1726
01:07:38,482 --> 01:07:40,882
You've met in the beginning. It's from her.

1727
01:07:40,882 --> 01:07:42,422
- Seung Hyun? - Yes.

1728
01:07:42,422 --> 01:07:46,522
I also delivered the action message from Seung Hyun.

1729
01:07:46,522 --> 01:07:48,382
Didn't you say I'm not your ideal type?

1730
01:07:48,382 --> 01:07:50,152
- Shall we go to prison then? - Okay.

1731
01:07:50,152 --> 01:07:51,152
Let's go.

1732
01:07:51,752 --> 01:07:53,052
See you next week.

1733
01:07:53,052 --> 01:07:54,422
(Jae Seok delivered all the messages.)

1734
01:07:56,482 --> 01:07:58,322
Do you want some?

1735
01:07:58,522 --> 01:08:00,352
It's fun but hard.

1736
01:08:00,352 --> 01:08:02,152
Honestly,

1737
01:08:02,422 --> 01:08:05,022
I have no idea what's going on.

1738
01:08:05,522 --> 01:08:08,282
I really don't know what I should do.

1739
01:08:08,282 --> 01:08:09,752
(What is he trying to say?)

1740
01:08:10,822 --> 01:08:11,852
I...

1741
01:08:12,582 --> 01:08:13,622
(He hesitates.)

1742
01:08:13,652 --> 01:08:16,522
- You're doing well. - Can I tell him now?

1743
01:08:16,682 --> 01:08:18,422
I shouldn't tell him about my tag, right?

1744
01:08:18,422 --> 01:08:20,892
- You can't say that. - I have no idea...

1745
01:08:20,892 --> 01:08:23,122
(Is he going to tell Jong Kook about his tag?)

1746
01:08:24,122 --> 01:08:28,682
Turn the cameras off. Mine is zero dollars.

1747
01:08:28,722 --> 01:08:30,722
(Did he just say he has zero dollars?)

1748
01:08:31,122 --> 01:08:32,852
Well...

1749
01:08:33,152 --> 01:08:36,022
This is... Well...

1750
01:08:36,822 --> 01:08:38,022
(They have 4 minutes left.)

1751
01:08:38,022 --> 01:08:39,822
- Where is Jong Kook? - Haha is...

1752
01:08:39,822 --> 01:08:41,482
- Ji Hyo! - Ji Hyo, run!

1753
01:08:41,822 --> 01:08:43,322
(Ji Hyo, run!)

1754
01:08:43,922 --> 01:08:44,922
There are Yellowmons!

1755
01:08:44,922 --> 01:08:46,682
(Ji Hyo Hunters show up.)

1756
01:08:47,252 --> 01:08:50,052
(She's frozen.)

1757
01:08:50,052 --> 01:08:52,392
Soo Bin! Hurry!

1758
01:08:52,392 --> 01:08:53,922
What should we do?

1759
01:08:54,322 --> 01:08:55,892
They're right behind us!

1760
01:08:56,752 --> 01:08:57,982
Goodness.

1761
01:08:59,722 --> 01:09:01,782
No, no way!

1762
01:09:02,482 --> 01:09:04,782
(Hunters catch Ji Hyo.)

1763
01:09:05,752 --> 01:09:06,922
(Her name tag is removed.)

1764
01:09:07,752 --> 01:09:10,252
Goodness. Guys.

1765
01:09:12,852 --> 01:09:15,782
Does Soo Bin have to stay with Ji Hyo?

1766
01:09:16,022 --> 01:09:18,322
- Gosh, what is it? - I'm freed!

1767
01:09:19,022 --> 01:09:20,222
What is he doing?

1768
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:23,952
Soo Bin, stop right there. You know I can get you.

1769
01:09:23,952 --> 01:09:25,022
(The reward is mine.)

1770
01:09:25,022 --> 01:09:26,892
- Soo Bin. - Go away.

1771
01:09:26,892 --> 01:09:28,822
- You should come with me. - Go alone.

1772
01:09:28,822 --> 01:09:30,722
(The one with Blackmon is likely to win.)

1773
01:09:30,722 --> 01:09:33,022
- Please go alone. - What?

1774
01:09:33,022 --> 01:09:35,922
- Let's hurry. - No way!

1775
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:38,022
(1 minute and 27 seconds remain.)

1776
01:09:38,022 --> 01:09:39,782
(Haha owns Soo Bin.)

1777
01:09:40,782 --> 01:09:42,922
(Now, Haha and Jong Kook are close to winning.)

1778
01:09:43,522 --> 01:09:45,952
- I think he went that way. - Let's hurry.

1779
01:09:45,952 --> 01:09:48,352
- That way? - Let's go this way.

1780
01:09:48,782 --> 01:09:51,452
I think I'll run into a monster.

1781
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:57,122
(The race is almost over.)

1782
01:09:58,952 --> 01:10:01,282
(Who will get the Blackmon with 10 dollars?)

1783
01:10:02,022 --> 01:10:03,322
Let me thank you all...

1784
01:10:03,322 --> 01:10:07,622
who joined Running Man today.

1785
01:10:07,822 --> 01:10:12,052
They ran around Yeouido all day long...

1786
01:10:12,052 --> 01:10:13,822
to catch us.

1787
01:10:13,822 --> 01:10:16,552
The scariest ones are Jong Kook Hunters.

1788
01:10:17,122 --> 01:10:19,822
- I thought you were thugs. - We're not thugs.

1789
01:10:19,822 --> 01:10:21,552
- They are so scary. - They are.

1790
01:10:21,892 --> 01:10:25,752
Look at Chang Ryul, Ha Neul and the rest of the members.

1791
01:10:26,122 --> 01:10:29,392
They also look scary. There is also Ma A Sung.

1792
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:32,392
- M. Tyson. - Right. M.Tyson and Min Hyuk.

1793
01:10:32,392 --> 01:10:33,892
I've never seen such scary group before.

1794
01:10:33,892 --> 01:10:35,152
- Right. - Min Hyuk...

1795
01:10:35,152 --> 01:10:38,222
Min Hyuk joined Running Man before,

1796
01:10:38,422 --> 01:10:41,322
and he's performing in Southeast Asia now.

1797
01:10:41,322 --> 01:10:44,082
- He went to Vietnam. - He performed in Vietnam.

1798
01:10:44,222 --> 01:10:45,282
- That's right. - Sing for us!

1799
01:10:45,852 --> 01:10:48,222
(He's singing.)

1800
01:10:48,222 --> 01:10:49,282
(Good Job, A Sung.)

1801
01:10:49,282 --> 01:10:51,722
So you're popular. It's amazing.

1802
01:10:52,322 --> 01:10:56,422
Ji Hyo Hunters are ToppDogg and young comedians.

1803
01:10:56,582 --> 01:10:58,922
I mistook Eun Hyung for a ghost.

1804
01:11:00,582 --> 01:11:02,852
- You really scared me. - Eun Hyung,

1805
01:11:03,022 --> 01:11:05,282
- Yes? - when are you going to get married?

1806
01:11:05,282 --> 01:11:07,582
- They'll in April, next year. - We'll marry in April.

1807
01:11:07,822 --> 01:11:10,222
- Congratulations. - Great.

1808
01:11:10,222 --> 01:11:12,022
(Congratulations!)

1809
01:11:12,022 --> 01:11:14,222
Where is your groom? He's right here.

1810
01:11:14,482 --> 01:11:16,222
So you'll finally get married.

1811
01:11:16,422 --> 01:11:17,982
- In April. - You're going to get married.

1812
01:11:18,022 --> 01:11:20,852
We have 24K and KNK with us.

1813
01:11:20,852 --> 01:11:22,582
I am really sorry.

1814
01:11:22,582 --> 01:11:24,652
It's the largest number including them.

1815
01:11:24,652 --> 01:11:27,582
- I didn't know a lot of them. - 27 monsters ran after Seok Jin.

1816
01:11:27,922 --> 01:11:29,982
Do you remember Hae Ryeong?

1817
01:11:30,222 --> 01:11:33,722
- She played with Seok Jin before. - You're right.

1818
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:36,622
So he posted on his SNS account.

1819
01:11:36,682 --> 01:11:39,222
- It was "Hae", not "Hye". - Right.

1820
01:11:39,222 --> 01:11:41,422
- He was confused. - I made the mistake twice.

1821
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,682
And he asked her who she was today.

1822
01:11:43,722 --> 01:11:46,152
(I am sorry I have a short-term memory.)

1823
01:11:46,152 --> 01:11:50,152
- Now, Haha will make a decision. - Right, I will.

1824
01:11:50,392 --> 01:11:52,482
(Does Haha get to decide?)

1825
01:11:53,152 --> 01:11:55,622
(1 minute before the game ended)

1826
01:11:55,622 --> 01:11:57,392
(Jong Kook owned Jae Hyun.)

1827
01:11:57,392 --> 01:11:59,052
My goodness.

1828
01:11:59,052 --> 01:12:00,352
They're coming again!

1829
01:12:00,892 --> 01:12:02,652
(Jong Kook Hunters appeared.)

1830
01:12:03,622 --> 01:12:06,482
(If they remove Jong Kook's name tag, Jae Hyun will be freed.)

1831
01:12:11,582 --> 01:12:12,582
- Now! - Remove it!

1832
01:12:13,122 --> 01:12:16,922
(Haha removed Jong Kook's name tag and took Jae Hyun.)

1833
01:12:16,922 --> 01:12:18,752
We need the Blackmon to win.

1834
01:12:19,322 --> 01:12:20,982
I will remove their tags...

1835
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:25,782
and see what tag they have before I decide.

1836
01:12:26,522 --> 01:12:28,222
I just need to know how much they have.

1837
01:12:31,922 --> 01:12:35,892
They both denied. They're good at acting because it's their job.

1838
01:12:36,022 --> 01:12:39,282
- It's Soo Bin. - Really?

1839
01:12:39,282 --> 01:12:40,482
Haha.

1840
01:12:40,852 --> 01:12:42,052
(It's Jae Hyun.)

1841
01:12:42,522 --> 01:12:43,582
This is so difficult.

1842
01:12:43,582 --> 01:12:45,522
Do you know who it is, Jae Hyun?

1843
01:12:45,522 --> 01:12:47,182
I knew it but I forgot.

1844
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:50,952
The left is for 10 dollars and the right is zero dollars.

1845
01:12:50,952 --> 01:12:52,892
- Yes. - Please stand on this.

1846
01:12:52,892 --> 01:12:54,892
Don't unfollow Hae Ryeong.

1847
01:12:54,892 --> 01:12:56,922
- This is for zero dollars. - Gosh.

1848
01:12:56,922 --> 01:12:59,922
- I didn't know. - And you'll stand on this.

1849
01:13:00,622 --> 01:13:01,652
It was a mistake.

1850
01:13:01,652 --> 01:13:03,892
- You think Soo Bin has 10 dollars. - Right.

1851
01:13:04,322 --> 01:13:07,982
Haha owned Jae Hyun for seven minutes.

1852
01:13:08,652 --> 01:13:10,152
- It's 70 dollars. - That'd be 70 dollars.

1853
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:13,552
And he owned Soo Bin for 97 minutes.

1854
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:16,682
- 97 minutes? - You made a better choice.

1855
01:13:16,952 --> 01:13:18,152
It's Soo Bin, right?

1856
01:13:18,922 --> 01:13:21,122
- She is. - She is, Haha.

1857
01:13:21,222 --> 01:13:22,222
One!

1858
01:13:22,922 --> 01:13:24,652
I have zero dollars.

1859
01:13:24,782 --> 01:13:26,522
You must find Jae Hyun.

1860
01:13:26,522 --> 01:13:29,122
Why are you confusing me?

1861
01:13:29,392 --> 01:13:31,252
I'm really bad at lying.

1862
01:13:32,152 --> 01:13:33,782
- Two! - It's her.

1863
01:13:34,982 --> 01:13:36,782
I know you have zero dollars.

1864
01:13:37,152 --> 01:13:39,122
- Mine is zero. - Sorry?

1865
01:13:39,122 --> 01:13:41,152
What are you talking about?

1866
01:13:41,152 --> 01:13:43,252
(Does Jae Hyun really have zero dollars?)

1867
01:13:44,122 --> 01:13:45,122
Three!

1868
01:13:47,022 --> 01:13:49,922
(Is it Soo Bin or Jae Hyun?)

1869
01:13:50,252 --> 01:13:52,922
(Who has 10 dollars?)

1870
01:13:53,152 --> 01:13:54,422
(Soo Bin...)

1871
01:13:54,422 --> 01:13:55,582
(had zero dollars.)

1872
01:13:55,582 --> 01:13:56,652
Was I wrong?

1873
01:13:57,892 --> 01:13:58,922
(Haha fails.)

1874
01:13:59,322 --> 01:14:01,922
Goodness, I knew it!

1875
01:14:02,322 --> 01:14:03,952
- My goodness. - All right.

1876
01:14:04,222 --> 01:14:06,222
- Let's check, then. - Gosh.

1877
01:14:06,222 --> 01:14:07,422
What's going on?

1878
01:14:07,622 --> 01:14:08,622
Gosh.

1879
01:14:08,722 --> 01:14:11,422
- He has 10 dollars. - This is my shoe insert.

1880
01:14:11,422 --> 01:14:12,722
(Ta-da)

1881
01:14:12,892 --> 01:14:14,122
My goodness.

1882
01:14:14,122 --> 01:14:16,822
You should've put it somewhere else.

1883
01:14:16,822 --> 01:14:18,822
- Why did you put it on the insert? - He put it on the insert.

1884
01:14:18,822 --> 01:14:21,222
- Jae Hyun. - I can't believe this.

1885
01:14:21,222 --> 01:14:23,522
- This is a kind of etiquette. - He has a 10-dollar bill.

1886
01:14:23,522 --> 01:14:27,052
Therefore, these two Blackmons...

1887
01:14:27,322 --> 01:14:30,952
earned 310 dollars of reward!

1888
01:14:30,952 --> 01:14:32,122
(They won 310 dollars.)

1889
01:14:33,122 --> 01:14:34,152
Really?

1890
01:14:34,152 --> 01:14:36,252
Thank you again for your participation.

1891
01:14:36,252 --> 01:14:37,252
Thank you!

1892
01:14:37,252 --> 01:14:39,052
(Thank you Jae Hyun, Soo Bin...)

1893
01:14:39,052 --> 01:14:41,052
(and the 102 hunters for joining us.)

1894
01:14:41,052 --> 01:14:43,452
- Thank you! - You all did a great job!

1895
01:14:43,752 --> 01:14:44,782
Goodbye.

1896
01:14:45,852 --> 01:14:47,152
In 1, 2!

1897
01:14:47,822 --> 01:14:49,222
Thank you very much!

1898
01:14:50,122 --> 01:14:51,922
- Thank you. - You did a good job.

1899
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:55,122
- Thank you. - Thank you!

1900
01:14:55,122 --> 01:14:56,152
Say cheese.

1901
01:14:56,822 --> 01:14:59,052
- Thank you. - Thank you for joining us.

1902
01:14:59,052 --> 01:15:01,052
Go for it, Running Man!

1903
01:15:01,052 --> 01:15:02,422
Thank you.

1904
01:15:05,482 --> 01:15:07,482
Thank you. I'll enjoy this.

1905
01:15:07,652 --> 01:15:09,852
Thank you.

1906
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:12,252
Thank you very much.

1907
01:15:12,852 --> 01:15:14,952
- Thank you. - You all did a good job.

1908
01:15:14,952 --> 01:15:16,482
- Thank you. - Goodbye.

1909
01:15:18,982 --> 01:15:20,782
(And...)

1910
01:15:21,282 --> 01:15:24,392
(this is the first mission for the members and the guests.)

1911
01:15:24,392 --> 01:15:28,322
("Walk politely before someone who's in much higher position.")

1912
01:15:28,322 --> 01:15:33,822
(Find out how to say this in pure Korean words...)

1913
01:15:34,422 --> 01:15:36,682
(and bring it to us.)

1914
01:15:38,122 --> 01:15:43,982
(We'll give an advantage to the one who brings it to us first.)
