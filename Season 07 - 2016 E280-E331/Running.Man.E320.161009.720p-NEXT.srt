1
00:00:05,457 --> 00:00:08,897
(This is the first mission for the members and the guests.)

2
00:00:08,897 --> 00:00:12,527
("Walk politely before someone who's in much higher position.")

3
00:00:12,527 --> 00:00:16,327
(Find out how to say this in pure Korean words.)

4
00:00:16,327 --> 00:00:20,627
(We'll give an advantage to the one who brings it to us first.)

5
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:23,997
(The answer is "napa cabage".)

6
00:00:25,497 --> 00:00:31,527
(Who would be the first one to arrive with napa cabage?)

7
00:00:31,527 --> 00:00:36,057
(The appointed time, 2pm, is approaching.)

8
00:00:37,257 --> 00:00:41,127
(Who would be the first one to arrive?)

9
00:00:43,897 --> 00:00:45,597
It says I must find this place.

10
00:00:46,257 --> 00:00:47,657
Am I the first one to arrive?

11
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:51,727
(Who would he be?)

12
00:00:51,727 --> 00:00:52,927
Hello.

13
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:54,657
Hello.

14
00:00:55,297 --> 00:00:56,557
Hello.

15
00:00:58,957 --> 00:01:04,257
(He is the best supporting actor and the best comedy actor of all time.)

16
00:01:04,257 --> 00:01:07,527
(Yu Hae Jin is a guaranteed box office hit.)

17
00:01:08,097 --> 00:01:10,527
This must be the reception desk, right?

18
00:01:10,527 --> 00:01:11,627
(He's here with the napa cabage.)

19
00:01:11,627 --> 00:01:14,427
I brought the napa cabage.

20
00:01:15,927 --> 00:01:18,297
Am I the first one to arrive? I see.

21
00:01:18,297 --> 00:01:19,867
(What would be his advantage?)

22
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:23,727
(Nice, I'm first.)

23
00:01:25,897 --> 00:01:29,597
(It's good that I'm first,)

24
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:33,497
(but I think I came too early.)

25
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:40,197
(Time passes.)

26
00:01:40,197 --> 00:01:41,357
I'm bored.

27
00:01:43,797 --> 00:01:46,157
(Who's the second one to arrive?)

28
00:01:47,927 --> 00:01:51,127
Napa cabbage is really expensive nowadays.

29
00:01:52,457 --> 00:01:53,497
What is this?

30
00:01:54,957 --> 00:01:56,097
- Hello, Hae Jin. - Hey.

31
00:01:56,097 --> 00:01:58,057
(They arrived 1st and 2nd.)

32
00:01:58,057 --> 00:01:59,197
Good to see you.

33
00:01:59,927 --> 00:02:01,497
- It's been so long. - Yes.

34
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:03,097
Did you bring the napa cabbage?

35
00:02:03,097 --> 00:02:04,127
Of course.

36
00:02:05,357 --> 00:02:06,497
I brought one, too.

37
00:02:06,497 --> 00:02:08,857
- You even cleaned it. - I did.

38
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:11,457
Look how clean that is.

39
00:02:11,557 --> 00:02:14,957
That shows part of his character, you know?

40
00:02:14,957 --> 00:02:16,557
He got it all clean and wrapped up.

41
00:02:17,727 --> 00:02:19,497
(Same last name, different napa cabbages.)

42
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:23,457
The price of napa cabbage has gone up.

43
00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:25,597
Hello.

44
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:27,857
- Hello. - Hey.

45
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:28,927
You're here already?

46
00:02:29,527 --> 00:02:30,597
Yes, I am.

47
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:33,457
You've got love written all over you.

48
00:02:34,357 --> 00:02:38,627
(Kwang Soo is the third person to arrive with napa cabbage.)

49
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:42,827
(A black vehicle pulls over.)

50
00:02:46,027 --> 00:02:48,157
(It's Lee Joon, actor and idol singer.)

51
00:02:49,857 --> 00:02:54,427
(He's as good of an actor as he is a dancer.)

52
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,527
- Hello. - Hey, Joon.

53
00:02:58,827 --> 00:03:00,327
Good to see you.

54
00:03:00,627 --> 00:03:01,627
I see you've got your napa cabbage.

55
00:03:01,627 --> 00:03:03,827
Wait a minute. That's just ordinary cabbage.

56
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:05,227
It's Chinese cabbage.

57
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,397
I see. I didn't know there was cabbage like that.

58
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:08,657
It's the same one you brought.

59
00:03:08,657 --> 00:03:10,857
How would you know when your mum does groceries for you?

60
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,627
- You're such a mummy's boy. - I'm not.

61
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,397
Gosh, aren't you too old for that?

62
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,797
(Someone comes running in.)

63
00:03:19,197 --> 00:03:20,397
Napa cabbage.

64
00:03:24,097 --> 00:03:25,157
- Hello. - Hello.

65
00:03:25,157 --> 00:03:26,297
(She's startled.)

66
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:29,027
- Hello. - Is he someone you should avoid?

67
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:31,327
Did you borrow money from him?

68
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:33,327
I was really surprised to see him here.

69
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:35,427
(You didn't have to be that surprised.)

70
00:03:44,297 --> 00:03:45,397
Hello.

71
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:51,797
(Her crystal clear skin is just a bonus to her good acting.)

72
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:53,797
(It's Lim Ji Yeon.)

73
00:03:55,157 --> 00:03:56,597
(Is she playing American football with that napa cabbage?)

74
00:03:58,097 --> 00:03:59,457
- Hello. - Hey, Ji Yeon.

75
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:01,327
- Ji Yeon is here. - Hey, Ji Yeon.

76
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:02,427
Hello.

77
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:06,997
(Who's next?)

78
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:12,597
Hello.

79
00:04:12,597 --> 00:04:15,657
(It's Jo Yoon Hee.)

80
00:04:16,527 --> 00:04:20,157
(She's lovely and pure like the autumn sky.)

81
00:04:22,957 --> 00:04:28,257
(She picked her own napa cabbage at the market.)

82
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:31,427
Is that Seok Jin?

83
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:33,127
- Hello. - I know who that is.

84
00:04:33,127 --> 00:04:34,297
(He just grabs the flag.)

85
00:04:34,297 --> 00:04:36,097
Did you bring your napa cabbage?

86
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:37,627
Gary's here.

87
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:38,697
- Hey, Gary. - It's Gary.

88
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:39,757
Hello.

89
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:44,857
(Jong Kook is the last one to arrive.)

90
00:04:44,857 --> 00:04:45,997
- Gosh. - What?

91
00:04:45,997 --> 00:04:47,297
- Can you quiet down? - Hello.

92
00:04:47,297 --> 00:04:49,097
(What mission will they be carrying out today?)

93
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:53,127
It's been so long since Hae Jin was here in the show.

94
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,697
- That's right. - I'm a big fan.

95
00:04:54,697 --> 00:04:57,257
- We missed you so much. - How long has it been?

96
00:04:57,257 --> 00:04:58,727
I think it's been almost three years.

97
00:04:59,357 --> 00:05:00,627
You came on the show three years ago.

98
00:05:00,627 --> 00:05:01,827
It's been too long.

99
00:05:02,157 --> 00:05:04,657
It really has. Joon, it's nice to see you, too.

100
00:05:04,657 --> 00:05:06,567
- He's more of an actor now. - He is.

101
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:09,997
Kwang Soo has been...

102
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:11,897
very jealous of you.

103
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:14,027
What are you talking about?

104
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:16,197
Joon is Kwang Soo's role model.

105
00:05:16,197 --> 00:05:18,157
He's not my role model.

106
00:05:18,157 --> 00:05:20,497
- I like him and all, but... - Kwang Soo used to be an actor,

107
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:21,757
but he made a debut as a fish.

108
00:05:21,757 --> 00:05:24,427
- What are you talking about? - It's all over television.

109
00:05:24,427 --> 00:05:26,567
I'm a human being.

110
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:28,227
He made a debut as a fish.

111
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,657
- He's half human and half fish. - That's what I said.

112
00:05:30,657 --> 00:05:32,757
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

113
00:05:32,757 --> 00:05:35,497
Now that you're all here,

114
00:05:35,497 --> 00:05:39,427
people who got the correct answer were given 10 dollars each.

115
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:43,597
The person who came first will get special benefits.

116
00:05:43,597 --> 00:05:45,157
(Special benefits are waiting for Hae Jin.)

117
00:05:45,157 --> 00:05:47,697
- What about all the rest of us? - Who's first?

118
00:05:47,697 --> 00:05:49,457
- Who came in first? - Let me finish.

119
00:05:49,457 --> 00:05:51,897
The team who came in early will share the benefits with him.

120
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:53,797
Are we sitting in the order we arrived?

121
00:05:53,797 --> 00:05:56,697
We divided you into teams in the order of your arrival.

122
00:05:56,827 --> 00:05:58,627
From 1st to 4th place are in the same team.

123
00:06:00,257 --> 00:06:02,027
- Are we a team with only guys? - Wait a minute.

124
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,327
(He expresses outrage.)

125
00:06:04,327 --> 00:06:06,727
Give us at least one of the girls.

126
00:06:08,357 --> 00:06:09,427
Are you kidding me?

127
00:06:09,427 --> 00:06:11,557
Is Seok Jin with the three of them?

128
00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:12,997
- Is this the team? - That's it?

129
00:06:13,427 --> 00:06:15,457
From 5th to 8th place are on the same team.

130
00:06:15,857 --> 00:06:18,597
- From 5th to 8th? - Are you serious?

131
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:20,857
- Are they on the same team? - This is ridiculous.

132
00:06:21,057 --> 00:06:23,397
- Are you serious? - I finally got what I deserve.

133
00:06:23,397 --> 00:06:24,597
At least one the women should join our team.

134
00:06:24,597 --> 00:06:27,627
- This isn't fair. - I shouldn't have worn this shirt.

135
00:06:27,827 --> 00:06:29,027
Gosh.

136
00:06:29,027 --> 00:06:30,157
(This team is pretty upset as well.)

137
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:33,597
We prepared a game where you can win to switch team members.

138
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,927
- Thank goodness. - I see.

139
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,697
We thank you all for coming.

140
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:39,197
You must be hungry. We'll be going to get some food.

141
00:06:39,197 --> 00:06:40,257
- I see? - You're feeding us?

142
00:06:40,257 --> 00:06:42,727
- Behind the door, - Are you serious?

143
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:44,657
there is a buffet for you.

144
00:06:44,657 --> 00:06:46,897
- Follow me, Princesses. - Let's go.

145
00:06:47,027 --> 00:06:48,797
- Princesses? - Come with me.

146
00:06:50,397 --> 00:06:52,957
(What's waiting for them behind those doors?)

147
00:06:52,957 --> 00:06:54,157
What's all this?

148
00:06:54,557 --> 00:06:56,827
- He wasn't kidding. - It's a buffet.

149
00:07:00,027 --> 00:07:02,827
(There are all sorts of food lined up for them.)

150
00:07:02,827 --> 00:07:03,827
Is this for real?

151
00:07:04,797 --> 00:07:06,657
- Don't dig in just yet. - There's so much food.

152
00:07:06,857 --> 00:07:11,827
(We have fresh vegetables and delicious meat.)

153
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:15,657
(It's a full course menu.)

154
00:07:16,497 --> 00:07:18,557
- We should start eating. - What are we waiting for?

155
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,857
- Look at all that. - Can we eat?

156
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:23,327
Are we allowed to eat?

157
00:07:23,897 --> 00:07:27,027
They're not going to tell us anything.

158
00:07:27,027 --> 00:07:28,697
I'm going with brown rice for my health.

159
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:32,927
Do we have to pay for the food later?

160
00:07:33,157 --> 00:07:35,327
- I wanted to eat that one. - You guys should choose.

161
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:37,497
I think I'll have some frozen pollock jeon.

162
00:07:37,497 --> 00:07:39,227
- Is there frozen pollock jeon? - Yes.

163
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:41,397
I think I'll have some noodles as well.

164
00:07:41,397 --> 00:07:43,357
- I want some, too. - What's this?

165
00:07:43,357 --> 00:07:45,127
- I think it's buckwheat noodles. - Can't I?

166
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:46,157
Take a seat.

167
00:07:46,157 --> 00:07:47,597
- Can you eat all that? - Where's orange juice?

168
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:48,797
I got too ambitious.

169
00:07:48,797 --> 00:07:50,257
Do you want some orange juice?

170
00:07:50,427 --> 00:07:52,057
I think I want milk.

171
00:07:53,497 --> 00:07:55,727
Can we get started? I got too much.

172
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:58,227
Are you not going to let us eat them?

173
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:00,257
Come here, Love.

174
00:08:00,257 --> 00:08:02,397
- I'm coming. - Come over here.

175
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:04,327
KBS has Choo Sa Rang and we have...

176
00:08:04,657 --> 00:08:07,357
- Come here, Sa Rang. - I said I'm coming.

177
00:08:08,957 --> 00:08:10,497
He's Lee Sa Rang.

178
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:12,597
- Can we start? - Look at what Kwang Soo got.

179
00:08:12,597 --> 00:08:14,927
- Are you all ready to eat? - Yes.

180
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:18,597
Before you begin, we'll be holding an inspection.

181
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:20,457
- Come in. - What inspection?

182
00:08:22,697 --> 00:08:27,327
- What's this? - What's going on?

183
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:29,257
What are you doing?

184
00:08:29,797 --> 00:08:30,857
What's going on?

185
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:32,427
(He's shocked.)

186
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:34,597
- What's going on? - Why are you taking it away?

187
00:08:36,497 --> 00:08:37,627
What's going on?

188
00:08:37,827 --> 00:08:42,227
Ji Yeon didn't even take much food.

189
00:08:42,997 --> 00:08:44,427
She only has seaweed soup left.

190
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:46,457
Look how sad she is.

191
00:08:46,457 --> 00:08:47,597
What are you doing?

192
00:08:47,597 --> 00:08:48,797
Why are you taking the food away from us?

193
00:08:48,797 --> 00:08:50,057
- What's going on? - I don't have anything left.

194
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:51,457
Who said you could do that?

195
00:08:51,457 --> 00:08:53,297
You took away almost everything.

196
00:08:53,297 --> 00:08:54,627
- What's going on? - I don't have any food left.

197
00:08:54,627 --> 00:08:55,797
(On what basis are they taking away food from the members?)

198
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:57,927
Hae Jin came in first and he has less food than me.

199
00:08:58,827 --> 00:09:00,167
(Where did all the food go?)

200
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:01,797
What's going on here?

201
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:06,127
(Why are they taking away my food?)

202
00:09:07,357 --> 00:09:10,527
Today is Hangeul Day Special. It's called Acquire the Consonants.

203
00:09:10,527 --> 00:09:11,957
(Acquire the Consonants)

204
00:09:11,957 --> 00:09:13,327
- Acquire the Consonants? - Consonants?

205
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:17,167
There are a total of 14 consonants in the Korean language.

206
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:20,297
The team who collects all 14 of them first,

207
00:09:20,297 --> 00:09:22,497
will get benefits that will help you in the final battle.

208
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:25,457
The consonants that you can start working with...

209
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:27,797
are the ones that are composing the team members' names.

210
00:09:27,797 --> 00:09:31,667
(They're only allowed to work with the consonants of their names.)

211
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:32,697
What?

212
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:37,727
For instance, Jae Seok has the consonants, J, S and G.

213
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:39,957
- J? - J, S and G.

214
00:09:39,957 --> 00:09:43,127
The Y in Yu is a vowel.

215
00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:47,397
The food you are allowed to eat...

216
00:09:47,597 --> 00:09:51,797
are the ones that have names consisted of your names' consonants.

217
00:09:52,227 --> 00:09:53,627
- What about the brown rice? - I have sashimi.

218
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,227
- I have salmon. - I don't get it.

219
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:58,327
The reason for that is because...

220
00:09:58,627 --> 00:10:01,927
Hae Jin brought napa cabbage.

221
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:03,697
- He got B and Ch as a bonus. - I see.

222
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:06,997
- So we're allowed to take a bus? - Exactly.

223
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:10,097
What about us? The only word we can make up is a sedan chair.

224
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:13,827
- We can do horse. - You can do horse.

225
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:15,357
- Cow. - Cow?

226
00:10:15,757 --> 00:10:18,667
Do the consonants change when we switch members?

227
00:10:18,697 --> 00:10:21,427
Yes, you will be able to make more combinations.

228
00:10:21,797 --> 00:10:24,197
Enjoy your food.

229
00:10:24,197 --> 00:10:25,927
Are you kidding me?

230
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:27,227
(They're complaining.)

231
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,957
We need as many consonants as we can get.

232
00:10:28,957 --> 00:10:30,397
Do I have to eat this?

233
00:10:31,357 --> 00:10:33,667
Do you know what kind of food he's used to eating?

234
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:37,627
(Sashimi is all he got left.)

235
00:10:37,627 --> 00:10:39,027
Gosh, this isn't going down easily.

236
00:10:40,757 --> 00:10:44,597
- I need rice. - I never had brown rice on its own.

237
00:10:44,597 --> 00:10:47,297
It must be very delicious.

238
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:49,427
Let's get changed...

239
00:10:49,427 --> 00:10:52,127
and get to the place for the first mission.

240
00:10:52,197 --> 00:10:53,727
- Let's go. - Gosh.

241
00:10:56,597 --> 00:10:58,927
(This is their last chance to switch members.)

242
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:00,657
- What is all this? - Are those microphones?

243
00:11:01,197 --> 00:11:03,057
- It's this way. - They're microphones.

244
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:07,297
This game is called "Guess the Word".

245
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:09,027
- "Guess the Word"? - Yes.

246
00:11:09,227 --> 00:11:12,327
To celebrate Hangeul Day, we prepared a quiz about Hangeul.

247
00:11:12,327 --> 00:11:16,327
Two of the team members have to form the letter with their bodies...

248
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:19,157
when the staff members show you the letter.

249
00:11:19,157 --> 00:11:20,197
So that's how you do it?

250
00:11:20,197 --> 00:11:23,027
The other members have to guess the correct answer.

251
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,357
- All right. - Yes?

252
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:26,057
- Joon majored in modern dance. - That's right.

253
00:11:26,057 --> 00:11:28,197
- I remember it now. - He knows how to express with body.

254
00:11:29,027 --> 00:11:32,797
So I think it is a good idea for Hae Jin and Joon to make letters.

255
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:34,227
(Actor Lee Joon and Yu Hae Jin will make a great team.)

256
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:37,157
- So why don't you two make letters? - That sounds okay.

257
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,927
- Who should do it? - I will.

258
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:40,327
Okay. We will make letters together.

259
00:11:40,327 --> 00:11:42,127
- I'll make letters with Yoon Hee. - All right, then.

260
00:11:42,127 --> 00:11:44,097
- Okay. - Let's switch after a few turns.

261
00:11:44,197 --> 00:11:46,697
We're not going to change any of our members with them anyway.

262
00:11:46,697 --> 00:11:49,297
- We won't. - We won't even if you beg us.

263
00:11:49,327 --> 00:11:51,597
- We don't want to be on your team. - We don't need any of you.

264
00:11:51,597 --> 00:11:52,827
We didn't even consider changing members with you.

265
00:11:53,397 --> 00:11:57,997
I knew Joon was handsome, but he seems more handsome with you around.

266
00:11:57,997 --> 00:11:59,897
- Do you mean Hae Jin is ugly? - Yes. How about him?

267
00:11:59,897 --> 00:12:01,857
(Is that what you really meant?)

268
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:04,297
Tell me. Are you saying that Hae Jin is ugly?

269
00:12:04,297 --> 00:12:06,557
I like him personally, but what I really meant is...

270
00:12:06,957 --> 00:12:10,157
Jae Suk, are you trying to say that I look ugly?

271
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:15,297
- That's what he meant, not me. - Are you sure? I don't think so.

272
00:12:16,297 --> 00:12:19,457
- Don't say such bad things to him. - Stop it, Jae Seok.

273
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:21,497
- Do we have to make one letter? - Here comes the first question.

274
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:25,257
Please choose the word with the following meaning.

275
00:12:25,557 --> 00:12:28,857
How do you call the answer, spoken without any regard or concern?

276
00:12:28,897 --> 00:12:32,097
How do you call the answer, spoken without any regard or concern?

277
00:12:32,097 --> 00:12:34,027
- Yes? Without what? - Without any regard or...

278
00:12:34,027 --> 00:12:35,927
- What? - Without any regard or...

279
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:38,457
- Oh, you meant regard. - Yes, he said regard.

280
00:12:39,097 --> 00:12:40,097
(It's like talking to a brick wall.)

281
00:12:40,097 --> 00:12:41,957
- Yes, that's right. - Yes. Without any regard.

282
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:43,457
"Let's see..."

283
00:12:44,027 --> 00:12:45,927
"Splash, splash".

284
00:12:46,797 --> 00:12:47,797
"Splash?"

285
00:12:48,397 --> 00:12:51,197
How do you call the answer, spoken without any regard or concern?

286
00:12:51,757 --> 00:12:53,657
Number one, a needless answer.

287
00:12:54,027 --> 00:12:56,057
Number two, a back answer.

288
00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:57,757
Number three, a wrong answer.

289
00:12:57,927 --> 00:12:59,327
Number four, an indifferent answer.

290
00:12:59,327 --> 00:13:00,697
Here comes the letter.

291
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,757
(The answer, spoken without any regard or concern)

292
00:13:04,057 --> 00:13:06,857
- In 3, 2, 1. - Gyu. We have to make gyu.

293
00:13:06,897 --> 00:13:09,027
(Muddling)

294
00:13:09,027 --> 00:13:10,027
- Please call out your letter. - Hurry. Climb up and make G.

295
00:13:10,027 --> 00:13:12,327
- Yes. That's it. - Gyu.

296
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:13,657
(That doesn't look like G at all, does it?)

297
00:13:13,657 --> 00:13:15,557
- Gyu. Here is gyu. - Gosh. What are they doing?

298
00:13:15,557 --> 00:13:17,127
- Gyu? How can we make gyu? - Clime up on me. Hurry.

299
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:18,327
(They don't know what to do.)

300
00:13:19,297 --> 00:13:21,497
- What are they doing? - Okay. Climb up on me first.

301
00:13:21,597 --> 00:13:22,997
Climb up on me and make G like this.

302
00:13:23,057 --> 00:13:24,257
- This is gyu. - Look at Jong Kook.

303
00:13:24,797 --> 00:13:26,727
- Yes. That's it. - What are they doing?

304
00:13:26,957 --> 00:13:28,927
- Hurry. Climb up on me. - Gyu. We made gyu.

305
00:13:28,927 --> 00:13:30,057
Here. Here is our gyu.

306
00:13:30,057 --> 00:13:31,497
(That's a proper gyu.)

307
00:13:32,757 --> 00:13:35,497
(Green Team successfully makes their letter.)

308
00:13:35,497 --> 00:13:36,497
- Gosh. - Yes. That's it.

309
00:13:37,357 --> 00:13:39,397
- How can't you even do one thing? - Should we make it like this?

310
00:13:39,397 --> 00:13:40,397
(They still don't have any idea to make gyu.)

311
00:13:40,397 --> 00:13:43,097
- Is that gyu? Really? - You two, come out.

312
00:13:43,227 --> 00:13:44,697
- Hey, come out. Let's change. - Hold on a minute.

313
00:13:44,697 --> 00:13:47,327
- Here. You should turn here. - Number two, a back answer.

314
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:49,927
(Number 2 is incorrect.)

315
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:53,097
- It's not? - Gyu. Here.

316
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:54,897
- Gyu. Here is our gyu. - No way.

317
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:57,827
We accept the answer only if we can read it on our side.

318
00:13:59,157 --> 00:14:00,557
(That's a proper gyu.)

319
00:14:01,857 --> 00:14:03,657
- Ji Hyo. That's the opposite. - That's right.

320
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:05,297
(Blue team successfully makes the letter.)

321
00:14:05,657 --> 00:14:08,597
Okay. The answer is number three, a wrong answer.

322
00:14:09,957 --> 00:14:11,097
- No, it's not. - It's the wrong answer.

323
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:14,497
(Gosh, what was that?)

324
00:14:14,497 --> 00:14:15,697
- What a surprise. - Hurry up.

325
00:14:16,697 --> 00:14:17,957
- Look. They made it. - The answer must be number four.

326
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:21,057
(Red Team made the letter properly.)

327
00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:24,297
It's number four, an indifferent answer.

328
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:28,327
(Is it the correct answer?)

329
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:30,357
- It's number four. - An indifferent answer.

330
00:14:30,657 --> 00:14:33,127
(Number 4 is correct.)

331
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:34,127
- What was the answer? - An indifferent answer.

332
00:14:34,127 --> 00:14:36,497
- An indifferent answer? Really? - Ji Yeon is a master.

333
00:14:36,497 --> 00:14:38,457
The word "indifferent" must mean unconcerned or something similar.

334
00:14:38,657 --> 00:14:41,227
I haven't seen anyone dancing like her for a long time.

335
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:42,557
(She dances when she gets the correct answer.)

336
00:14:42,557 --> 00:14:44,697
- I haven't seen such a thing. - That's so old-fashioned.

337
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:46,657
(She dances like someone from the 80's.)

338
00:14:47,627 --> 00:14:50,097
Ji Yeon is really amazing.

339
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,357
- Okay. - Their questions are quite simple.

340
00:14:51,597 --> 00:14:53,597
All right, you two should come out. Let us do it instead.

341
00:14:53,597 --> 00:14:54,927
- Shall we? - Yes. Let's go.

342
00:14:55,157 --> 00:14:56,497
- Okay. - They were really bad last time.

343
00:14:56,497 --> 00:14:59,227
- Let them give one more try. - No, we shall do it.

344
00:14:59,457 --> 00:15:05,197
What is the proper Korean alternative word for "tough guy"?

345
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:07,857
- Kim Jong Kook. - It must be Kim Jong Kook.

346
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:10,197
- I think I know the answer. - Kim Jong Kook sounds correct.

347
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,797
Number one, wild man.

348
00:15:12,797 --> 00:15:15,327
Number two, strong man.

349
00:15:15,327 --> 00:15:17,697
Number three, nice guy.

350
00:15:17,697 --> 00:15:21,197
- Number 4, cheerful man. - I think it's number 4.

351
00:15:21,197 --> 00:15:22,357
- Do you know the answer? - One, two, three.

352
00:15:22,397 --> 00:15:25,227
- Isn't it number four? - Make mu.

353
00:15:26,157 --> 00:15:30,757
(They were really confident, but now they look totally confused.)

354
00:15:30,757 --> 00:15:32,927
- Mu? How can we make mu? - That's right. Yoon Hee did it.

355
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,127
- Hold on a minute. - Climb up on me. Hurry.

356
00:15:34,127 --> 00:15:35,597
- Here. We did it. - How should we make it?

357
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:40,457
(They are totally confused.)

358
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:46,957
(They are creating a new Hangeul on Hangeul Day.)

359
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:49,197
- They did it. - Grab my hands.

360
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:50,397
- Wait. Was it mu? - Yes. Mu.

361
00:15:50,397 --> 00:15:51,497
- It's mu. - Hurry up.

362
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:53,227
- Climb up on me. Quickly. - Hold on a second, Hae Jin.

363
00:15:53,227 --> 00:15:54,757
- Hurry. We have the answer already. - What should I do?

364
00:15:55,297 --> 00:15:56,557
What do you want me to do?

365
00:15:56,557 --> 00:15:57,997
(What are you doing?)

366
00:15:57,997 --> 00:15:59,027
(Why are you lying down?)

367
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:01,227
- Look. - You must make Mu.

368
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,797
- Make a square first. - We're just going the harder way.

369
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,197
- That's not Mu. - Gosh.

370
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,297
(That is unreadable.)

371
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:07,897
(I don't know what's going on.)

372
00:16:08,697 --> 00:16:10,797
(Kwang Soo gives them a hint.)

373
00:16:10,997 --> 00:16:12,627
- You need a square. - Make a square with your hands.

374
00:16:12,697 --> 00:16:14,997
- Come on. Just make a square. - Like this?

375
00:16:14,997 --> 00:16:16,557
(That's a proper Mu.)

376
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:19,197
- Like this? - Yes. That's how you do it.

377
00:16:19,197 --> 00:16:20,257
- You made Mu. - This is how you do it.

378
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:24,057
- Number 3, nice guy. - Number 3, nice guy.

379
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:26,297
(What is the proper Korean alternative word for "tough guy"?)

380
00:16:26,297 --> 00:16:28,297
- I don't think that's correct. - You said number three, nice guy.

381
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:30,657
- Nice. - Good job.

382
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:33,057
(Falling down)

383
00:16:33,897 --> 00:16:36,027
- Joon, are you all right? - What's wrong with you?

384
00:16:36,297 --> 00:16:37,427
- Good job. - That was nice.

385
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,127
- That was really close. - Here comes the next question.

386
00:16:40,297 --> 00:16:43,857
Among the underlined words...

387
00:16:43,857 --> 00:16:45,327
Where are the underlined words?

388
00:16:46,197 --> 00:16:48,227
- Where are the words? - Here, right over here.

389
00:16:48,227 --> 00:16:49,597
That was really straightforward.

390
00:16:49,597 --> 00:16:52,497
- Yes, he is. - You should give us the paper...

391
00:16:52,497 --> 00:16:54,697
- and show us the underlined words. - That's right.

392
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:56,597
- Yes, it makes sense. - You shouldn't read them like that.

393
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:58,197
If you underlined the words, you should show them instead.

394
00:16:58,197 --> 00:17:00,097
You make me curious. I'd love to see them with my own eyes.

395
00:17:01,457 --> 00:17:02,827
- "Let's see..." - "Splash, splash".

396
00:17:03,197 --> 00:17:05,057
- "Splash, splash". - "Splash".

397
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,027
Okay. I will make the question simple.

398
00:17:07,797 --> 00:17:10,957
Which one of the following words is not influenced by Japanese?

399
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:14,497
- Number one, autumnal colours. - Autumnal colours?

400
00:17:14,557 --> 00:17:17,097
Number two, secret promise.

401
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,997
- What was that? - Secret promise.

402
00:17:19,227 --> 00:17:21,597
Number three, playing matchmaker.

403
00:17:22,497 --> 00:17:24,697
Number four, introductory remark.

404
00:17:25,797 --> 00:17:27,557
- Which one of the following... - All right.

405
00:17:27,557 --> 00:17:29,757
- Hurry up. Make the letter. - Everyone saw you.

406
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,997
(Ha is easy to make. Which team will make the letter first?)

407
00:17:30,997 --> 00:17:32,697
- Hey. It's not hard at all. - Come on. Stand here.

408
00:17:32,697 --> 00:17:34,197
- Stand here, Hae Jin. - Ji Hyo, you're making the vowel.

409
00:17:35,997 --> 00:17:37,557
- We made it. We did. - Yes.

410
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,827
- Here. - Okay.

411
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:41,497
- We're the first, aren't we? - How did they make it?

412
00:17:41,497 --> 00:17:42,597
(Red Team makes the letter successfully.)

413
00:17:42,597 --> 00:17:43,997
It's not fair.

414
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:45,897
- Number two, secret promise. - Secret promise.

415
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:48,797
(Which one of the following words is not influenced by Japanese?)

416
00:17:48,797 --> 00:17:49,797
- Yes. - Nice.

417
00:17:49,797 --> 00:17:52,097
- Yes. - Really? Is it the correct answer?

418
00:17:52,097 --> 00:17:53,197
(Did we really get the correct answer?)

419
00:17:53,597 --> 00:17:56,367
Now, Red Team can switch members with other teams.

420
00:17:56,397 --> 00:17:57,497
All right. What should we do?

421
00:17:57,497 --> 00:17:59,597
(Red Team has a chance to switch members with other teams.)

422
00:17:59,597 --> 00:18:00,597
Hey. What are you doing?

423
00:18:00,597 --> 00:18:01,797
(Seok Jin is completely isolated.)

424
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:04,557
- They are harsh. - Hey. What are you doing?

425
00:18:04,827 --> 00:18:06,097
- What should we do now? - Are you kicking him out?

426
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:08,527
All right. We will trade you with Jong Kook.

427
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:10,827
(Do you really want to send me away?)

428
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:13,957
- Ji Hyo, don't do it. - That's too much.

429
00:18:13,957 --> 00:18:15,397
- Why? What's wrong? - How can you do that?

430
00:18:15,397 --> 00:18:18,197
- What's the matter? - You made up your mind, didn't you?

431
00:18:18,327 --> 00:18:19,397
It's better for Jong Kook to join her team for sure.

432
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:20,797
(Jong Kook and Seok Jin change their team.)

433
00:18:20,927 --> 00:18:23,227
- This isn't right. - Am I in the same team with them?

434
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,297
Our team is the worst. Even the colour of our clothes is gloomy.

435
00:18:27,257 --> 00:18:29,367
- The three worst guys are together. - This is the worst team ever.

436
00:18:34,757 --> 00:18:39,227
Use your consonants however you can...

437
00:18:39,227 --> 00:18:42,657
and find all 14 consonants to end the mission.

438
00:18:42,657 --> 00:18:44,457
Okay. Let's go.

439
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,867
(The mission ends if any one of the teams collect all consonants.)

440
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:47,697
Should we head to Tongin-dong first?

441
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:50,027
- Okay. - How should we go there?

442
00:18:50,027 --> 00:18:52,427
- Let's go there by car. - Yes. Any car will do.

443
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:55,757
- We can take a van. - You're right. We can take a van.

444
00:18:56,027 --> 00:18:58,897
We will get there by van.

445
00:18:58,897 --> 00:19:02,557
(Nice Van)

446
00:19:02,997 --> 00:19:05,327
- We have an amazing idea. - What is it?

447
00:19:05,597 --> 00:19:09,727
- Yes. - We're going to call Julie.

448
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:12,057
- She's your manager. - Yes, that's Julie.

449
00:19:12,057 --> 00:19:13,867
So we're going to call Julie.

450
00:19:14,157 --> 00:19:18,057
(Call Julie for Help)

451
00:19:18,397 --> 00:19:19,957
How about you? How will you go?

452
00:19:19,957 --> 00:19:22,367
- We will... - We have J, G and E,

453
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:24,197
- so we will go there by our car. - Our own car.

454
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:25,657
- I see. - That's nice.

455
00:19:25,657 --> 00:19:27,957
How about us? Can't we do the same?

456
00:19:28,197 --> 00:19:30,227
(They are trying their best to combine letters.)

457
00:19:30,227 --> 00:19:31,457
I haven't heard the word since I was a young kid.

458
00:19:31,457 --> 00:19:34,457
The name of my manager is Kang Sang Seon,

459
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,657
so we will take Sang Seon's car.

460
00:19:36,657 --> 00:19:38,697
- Private car sounds terrific. - Yes. Private car.

461
00:19:38,697 --> 00:19:41,657
(Sang Seon's Car)

462
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,997
We need to find L as fast as we can.

463
00:19:44,027 --> 00:19:46,227
- Why? - To see Sa Rang.

464
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,757
(We need to see Sa Rang for Kwang Soo.)

465
00:19:49,297 --> 00:19:51,657
- Why would we meet her? - To ride her car?

466
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,327
- Yes. To ride Sa Rang's car. - That sounds lovely.

467
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:55,757
Come on. I'm 32 years old.

468
00:19:55,757 --> 00:19:57,157
- All right. Can we leave now? - Yes.

469
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:58,897
- Okay. Let's go. - Let's go.

470
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:05,557
It's really nice to go there by this nice van.

471
00:20:05,557 --> 00:20:07,027
- There are so many stuffs here. - Really?

472
00:20:07,027 --> 00:20:08,827
- Ji Hyo, I'm sorry to say this, - Yes.

473
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:11,157
but I could smell cigarettes as soon as I got in.

474
00:20:11,697 --> 00:20:13,297
Do you know why?

475
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:15,457
Because my managers smoke here quite often.

476
00:20:15,457 --> 00:20:16,457
Your managers? I see.

477
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:20,557
- I can see pictures on the map. - What are they for?

478
00:20:20,797 --> 00:20:21,827
- This one must be about singing. - Yes. Singing.

479
00:20:22,057 --> 00:20:23,657
- There are some hints. - The 10-dollar bill.

480
00:20:23,697 --> 00:20:25,297
- I see. - Where are we heading?

481
00:20:25,297 --> 00:20:28,197
There's a place with the 10-dollar bill, and another with a microphone.

482
00:20:28,197 --> 00:20:29,557
- There's a place with food, too. - This place is about food.

483
00:20:29,557 --> 00:20:30,727
Do you want to go to the spot with food first?

484
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:32,497
- No, I'm fine. - Why not?

485
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,867
- I'm totally fine. - Sir,

486
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:35,457
- because Yoon Hee is hungry, - No, I'm not.

487
00:20:35,457 --> 00:20:37,697
- No. I mean it. - let's go to Tongin-dong first.

488
00:20:37,697 --> 00:20:41,867
- Stop it. Don't. - She surely wants to eat something.

489
00:20:42,397 --> 00:20:44,297
(She stared at Jong Kook when she mentioned the word, "food".)

490
00:20:45,027 --> 00:20:48,027
- Yoon Hee must be really hungry. - No, Jong Kook.

491
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:50,557
I'm not. I mean it.

492
00:20:50,557 --> 00:20:53,097
- We should just follow our plan. - She glared at me.

493
00:20:53,097 --> 00:20:55,997
- Let's go to Tongin-dong. - We should go there first.

494
00:20:56,597 --> 00:20:57,597
It must be Tongin Market.

495
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:01,197
We should go there first because Hae Jin lives near the place.

496
00:21:01,197 --> 00:21:03,197
Yes. He must know the place well.

497
00:21:03,197 --> 00:21:06,557
Yes, a bit.

498
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,597
Hae Jin, wasn't your tone really funny just now?

499
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,127
- Yes, that's right. - Now that you mention, I get it.

500
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:14,427
- Your tone is very unique... - You speak in that tone very often.

501
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:18,327
Every time people imitated me, I didn't know I talk in such a way.

502
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:20,097
"Let me see..."

503
00:21:20,097 --> 00:21:21,197
You...

504
00:21:21,557 --> 00:21:23,327
- You just did it. - Seeing you imitating me...

505
00:21:23,327 --> 00:21:25,227
- You just did it. - I didn't know...

506
00:21:25,227 --> 00:21:27,797
if I really talked in such a tone.

507
00:21:27,797 --> 00:21:30,157
Really? Actually, you do.

508
00:21:30,157 --> 00:21:31,367
I think so, too.

509
00:21:31,797 --> 00:21:34,257
How did you know the names of all the idol group members?

510
00:21:34,257 --> 00:21:35,827
- Did you memorise them? - No, I didn't.

511
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,297
They had name tags and I knew some of them.

512
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,757
- You read a lot of news articles. - You...

513
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,957
- Do you know all of them? - Of course not.

514
00:21:42,957 --> 00:21:44,457
That's impossible.

515
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:46,797
When I was a trainee...

516
00:21:46,997 --> 00:21:48,627
Were you ever a trainee?

517
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:52,427
(Hae Jin's sad history: I practised really hard when I was a trainee.)

518
00:21:52,427 --> 00:21:54,297
Hae Jin, were you really a trainee?

519
00:21:54,297 --> 00:21:55,997
I received acting training when I was young.

520
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:57,897
It's when you were training.

521
00:21:57,897 --> 00:21:59,357
I was really confused.

522
00:21:59,357 --> 00:22:01,797
- I was still a trainee, though. - You're right.

523
00:22:01,857 --> 00:22:03,127
- That's true. - Yes.

524
00:22:03,127 --> 00:22:04,657
I trained in something anyway.

525
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,227
I was pretty startled when you said that.

526
00:22:06,457 --> 00:22:08,527
I wondered what kind of idol group it would've been.

527
00:22:10,197 --> 00:22:11,597
Hae Jin also used to be a trainee.

528
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:13,327
I was still a trainee.

529
00:22:13,327 --> 00:22:15,527
(Hae Jin would've been a great idol member.)

530
00:22:16,427 --> 00:22:18,727
- So you're still a trainee. - That's right.

531
00:22:18,757 --> 00:22:20,227
We get it now.

532
00:22:21,827 --> 00:22:22,897
Let's get off.

533
00:22:22,957 --> 00:22:24,827
(SSJ)

534
00:22:24,827 --> 00:22:25,927
- Let's get off. - Okay.

535
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,397
(What will they do in this market?)

536
00:22:27,397 --> 00:22:29,257
- We're in Tongin Market right now. - Okay.

537
00:22:29,497 --> 00:22:32,457
You must eat food worth 10 dollars.

538
00:22:32,457 --> 00:22:34,527
- 10 dollars? - Look at her.

539
00:22:34,557 --> 00:22:37,597
Is this really a mission? It's too easy.

540
00:22:37,597 --> 00:22:39,527
But you shouldn't eat just one type of food.

541
00:22:39,527 --> 00:22:42,227
- You can buy only one serving. - Can we buy bread?

542
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,027
- You can't buy bread. - You can't buy that.

543
00:22:44,027 --> 00:22:45,097
- I can't? - No.

544
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,657
- Fish cake... - Fish cake.

545
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:47,997
- Gyoza. - Okay.

546
00:22:47,997 --> 00:22:49,857
- Naengmyun. - Naengmyun.

547
00:22:50,097 --> 00:22:51,127
We can also eat that.

548
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:52,557
We can also eat guksu.

549
00:22:52,557 --> 00:22:54,127
- That's right. - Guksu.

550
00:22:54,127 --> 00:22:55,957
We have more choices than I thought.

551
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:58,057
There's nothing we can eat.

552
00:22:58,057 --> 00:23:00,157
Do we have to only eat food with these consonants?

553
00:23:00,157 --> 00:23:01,757
- Right. - We can eat snacks.

554
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:03,327
- Good. - Snacks.

555
00:23:03,527 --> 00:23:05,427
- Cold rice. - Cold rice?

556
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:06,697
Cold rice...

557
00:23:07,297 --> 00:23:09,557
- I want something tasty. - What about spinach?

558
00:23:09,557 --> 00:23:11,227
- Spinach. - Spinach.

559
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:13,427
There's a lot of delicious food here.

560
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:15,457
- Hae Jin, let's go first. - Let's get going.

561
00:23:15,457 --> 00:23:18,227
- We never know what we'll find... - Wait!

562
00:23:18,227 --> 00:23:20,227
- Yakgwa. - Yakgwa!

563
00:23:20,227 --> 00:23:22,297
- Okay. - Yakgwa is here.

564
00:23:22,657 --> 00:23:24,457
- Yakgwa... - Hello, do you have...

565
00:23:24,457 --> 00:23:26,897
Ma'am, do you have a smaller pack of yakgwa?

566
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:28,057
Here.

567
00:23:28,057 --> 00:23:30,027
- Thank you. - Thank you.

568
00:23:30,397 --> 00:23:32,427
- Hae Jin, let's eat. - Good.

569
00:23:32,597 --> 00:23:34,897
- It's yakgwa. - I like this a lot.

570
00:23:34,897 --> 00:23:36,897
- Right. I like it, too. - It is very tasty.

571
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:39,227
- It's delicious. - Let's eat yakgwa first...

572
00:23:39,457 --> 00:23:41,197
- and then some laver next. - Laver?

573
00:23:41,197 --> 00:23:43,127
Isn't it a little weird?

574
00:23:43,127 --> 00:23:45,057
- Let's go see what else they sell. - Okay.

575
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,127
- Let's eat fish cake first. - Fish cake.

576
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:49,957
- 10 dollars' worth of fish cake. - I think that'd be really easy.

577
00:23:49,957 --> 00:23:52,757
One skewer is one serving.

578
00:23:52,857 --> 00:23:54,297
Isn't it too small?

579
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:55,597
Let's start eating.

580
00:23:55,597 --> 00:23:58,127
Thank you for giving us one more fish cake, Ma'am.

581
00:23:58,127 --> 00:23:59,197
(The faster they eat, the more advantage they'll get.)

582
00:23:59,197 --> 00:24:01,027
We just ate fish cake.

583
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:03,397
- Don't you want some jeon? - I want to eat jeon, too.

584
00:24:03,397 --> 00:24:05,027
- Jeon. - They have jeon.

585
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:07,057
- Do you have meat jeon? - We do.

586
00:24:07,057 --> 00:24:08,657
- It's here. - Please give us one serving.

587
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:10,827
- Just one serving. - Let's have sikhye.

588
00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:12,627
(Green Team)

589
00:24:12,627 --> 00:24:13,657
Is it tasty?

590
00:24:13,657 --> 00:24:15,897
(Green Team now has 7 dollars left.)

591
00:24:15,897 --> 00:24:18,327
(Blue Team has 3 dollars and Red Team has 4 dollars left.)

592
00:24:18,327 --> 00:24:19,357
Hey.

593
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:20,597
What should we eat next?

594
00:24:20,697 --> 00:24:22,027
Let's drink sikhye.

595
00:24:22,057 --> 00:24:23,357
(Red Team's consonants are G, N, M, S, Y, J and H.)

596
00:24:23,357 --> 00:24:25,097
How much is sikhye?

597
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:27,127
- It's one dollar. - Let's eat gangjeong.

598
00:24:27,127 --> 00:24:28,227
Did we spend 10 dollars?

599
00:24:28,227 --> 00:24:30,297
- We should buy this first. - Not yet.

600
00:24:30,657 --> 00:24:31,727
Good.

601
00:24:31,727 --> 00:24:34,197
- We spent all 10 dollars. - We did.

602
00:24:34,197 --> 00:24:35,627
You cleared the mission.

603
00:24:35,797 --> 00:24:36,857
Which one should we choose?

604
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,727
- What about L? - That's not bad.

605
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:41,797
- I want D or L. - I think L or Ch would be good.

606
00:24:41,797 --> 00:24:43,757
- Ch? - I like L.

607
00:24:44,027 --> 00:24:48,397
(Which one should we choose in order to win the round?)

608
00:24:48,397 --> 00:24:50,497
- If we choose Ch... - Let's choose D.

609
00:24:50,627 --> 00:24:52,727
"Tea" is the only option if we choose Ch.

610
00:24:52,727 --> 00:24:54,257
- Let's select D. - D?

611
00:24:54,257 --> 00:24:55,957
- Let's choose D. - D?

612
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:57,857
We'll select D, then.

613
00:24:58,157 --> 00:24:59,357
Please give it to us.

614
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:02,127
(Red Team earns D.)

615
00:25:02,197 --> 00:25:03,527
You succeeded your mission.

616
00:25:04,157 --> 00:25:06,827
Now, you can get an attacking card.

617
00:25:06,927 --> 00:25:07,957
(They get a letter and an attacking card.)

618
00:25:07,957 --> 00:25:09,697
Now, you can get an attacking card.

619
00:25:09,697 --> 00:25:12,627
There are different kinds of attacking card.

620
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:15,397
The Looting Card allows you to take another team's consonant.

621
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:17,957
If you choose Consonant Card,

622
00:25:17,957 --> 00:25:20,397
you can get an extra consonant.

623
00:25:20,927 --> 00:25:23,657
If you choose Stealing Card,

624
00:25:23,657 --> 00:25:25,727
one of you will become a thief. If the thief removes...

625
00:25:25,797 --> 00:25:29,657
someone else's name tag, he or she can get pick a consonant to take.

626
00:25:29,957 --> 00:25:31,797
You might also draw Better Luck Next Time.

627
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:32,997
- Okay. - There's Better Luck Next Time?

628
00:25:32,997 --> 00:25:34,227
Let's draw.

629
00:25:34,227 --> 00:25:35,427
- Yoon Hee... - Who'll draw?

630
00:25:35,427 --> 00:25:36,727
- Anyone. - Ji Yeon, please.

631
00:25:36,727 --> 00:25:37,757
(Ji Yeon draws a card.)

632
00:25:41,197 --> 00:25:42,427
(Nervous)

633
00:25:42,427 --> 00:25:43,557
Let's open it.

634
00:25:44,197 --> 00:25:46,257
Are you usually lucky?

635
00:25:46,627 --> 00:25:48,457
- I'm not bad. - Okay.

636
00:25:50,057 --> 00:25:51,597
Let's open it, then.

637
00:25:51,597 --> 00:25:53,857
(Attacking cards are very important for the final round.)

638
00:25:53,857 --> 00:25:55,827
(Let's see which card she picked.)

639
00:25:55,827 --> 00:25:57,027
Let's open it.

640
00:25:57,757 --> 00:25:58,857
(Stealing Card)

641
00:25:58,857 --> 00:25:59,897
I got Stealing Card.

642
00:25:59,897 --> 00:26:02,357
(Red Team's first attacking card is Stealing Card.)

643
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:03,457
I got Stealing Card.

644
00:26:03,457 --> 00:26:04,527
What is this?

645
00:26:04,527 --> 00:26:06,057
- It's... - We should remove a name tag.

646
00:26:06,057 --> 00:26:07,457
Then do we gain all the consonants?

647
00:26:07,457 --> 00:26:09,357
You can pick one of the consonants.

648
00:26:09,357 --> 00:26:10,827
Only if you remove a name tag.

649
00:26:10,827 --> 00:26:12,027
(Great!)

650
00:26:12,727 --> 00:26:14,657
- We must meet with others, then. - Right.

651
00:26:15,797 --> 00:26:19,797
(Wait for us. We'll coming to steal your consonant.)

652
00:26:20,397 --> 00:26:22,197
(Which team would fall victim to them?)

653
00:26:22,197 --> 00:26:24,157
- Here's your sikhye. - Thank you.

654
00:26:24,157 --> 00:26:25,857
- Thank you. - It's delicious.

655
00:26:26,357 --> 00:26:28,757
- When is the final round? - It's really tasty.

656
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:31,457
- This is... - They're over there.

657
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:32,657
- They're right there. - Where?

658
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,697
- Just choose anyone. - They've completed their mission.

659
00:26:34,857 --> 00:26:36,427
- Let's choose anyone. - Why don't you just go remove...

660
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:39,057
- They might do the same to us. - Do we just remove the name tag?

661
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:40,257
They might have the same card.

662
00:26:40,257 --> 00:26:42,957
(They finally meet their opponent.)

663
00:26:42,957 --> 00:26:44,627
- I will go... - They're here!

664
00:26:44,627 --> 00:26:45,857
- What are you doing here? - Did you clear your mission?

665
00:26:45,857 --> 00:26:47,257
- Everyone is here. - Did you complete the mission?

666
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:48,497
- Did you complete your mission? - Of course.

667
00:26:48,497 --> 00:26:50,627
- Really? - Do you want some gangjeong?

668
00:26:50,657 --> 00:26:52,827
- Did you have all the consonants? - Yes.

669
00:26:53,427 --> 00:26:55,057
Do you want to try some?

670
00:26:55,057 --> 00:26:56,157
(They're completely entrapped.)

671
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:58,257
- Is it good? - I want some, too.

672
00:26:58,257 --> 00:27:00,027
- Did you spend all your money? - Did you clear your mission?

673
00:27:00,027 --> 00:27:02,457
- We did. - Then don't you have...

674
00:27:02,457 --> 00:27:04,157
- to do something? - We just completed.

675
00:27:04,157 --> 00:27:06,257
- Don't you have to do something? - We just completed.

676
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:09,357
- There's corn. - Do you want some gangjeong?

677
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:10,827
- Are we having dinner now? - Sorry?

678
00:27:11,397 --> 00:27:13,357
- It is... - We're having dinner now.

679
00:27:13,357 --> 00:27:14,927
(We need to be quick.)

680
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:16,297
Do you want some?

681
00:27:16,757 --> 00:27:17,997
Chicken gangjeong?

682
00:27:17,997 --> 00:27:19,427
(There's only one chance.)

683
00:27:21,997 --> 00:27:23,757
(Ji Yeon is in action.)

684
00:27:24,627 --> 00:27:25,757
(She's looking for a chance.)

685
00:27:25,927 --> 00:27:27,027
Chicken gangjeong...

686
00:27:27,097 --> 00:27:29,157
- I got it! - What was that?

687
00:27:30,097 --> 00:27:32,257
- I got it! - What was that?

688
00:27:32,427 --> 00:27:33,857
- What happened? - What is going on?

689
00:27:34,227 --> 00:27:36,657
What was that? What?

690
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:38,997
(Ji Yeon successfully distracted them with food.)

691
00:27:38,997 --> 00:27:41,027
- What's going on? - Hold on.

692
00:27:41,097 --> 00:27:43,497
If you have the Stealing Card, you can get a consonant...

693
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:45,257
if you remove a name tag.

694
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:48,297
Gosh. That's why you gave us corn...

695
00:27:48,397 --> 00:27:49,457
and chicken gangjeong.

696
00:27:49,797 --> 00:27:51,597
You're too mean.

697
00:27:51,857 --> 00:27:52,957
Which consonant should we choose?

698
00:27:53,557 --> 00:27:54,627
What about L?

699
00:27:55,397 --> 00:27:56,827
Here's your L.

700
00:27:57,557 --> 00:27:59,727
Gosh, I never knew you'd be this mean to us.

701
00:27:59,727 --> 00:28:01,057
That was really harsh.

702
00:28:01,057 --> 00:28:02,757
Blue Team, you cleared your mission.

703
00:28:02,757 --> 00:28:05,197
Tell us a consonant you want.

704
00:28:05,197 --> 00:28:06,957
- Okay. - Which one should we pick?

705
00:28:06,997 --> 00:28:09,297
- I think L would be good. - We'll choose L, then.

706
00:28:09,327 --> 00:28:11,197
What about D?

707
00:28:11,197 --> 00:28:13,657
- Among these consonants... - I think D will be very helpful.

708
00:28:13,657 --> 00:28:14,797
You're right.

709
00:28:14,797 --> 00:28:17,627
- Let's pick D. - Okay. Please give us D.

710
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:18,757
D?

711
00:28:18,957 --> 00:28:21,657
- There are five cards. - Just pick one.

712
00:28:21,657 --> 00:28:24,197
- Just avoid Better Luck Next Time. - We have five attacking cards.

713
00:28:24,197 --> 00:28:26,457
- Please choose one. - Pick one.

714
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:27,557
Okay.

715
00:28:28,427 --> 00:28:31,197
(Let's see which card Blue Team obtained.)

716
00:28:31,197 --> 00:28:33,427
- What is it? - Stealing Card!

717
00:28:33,857 --> 00:28:34,927
What is it?

718
00:28:34,927 --> 00:28:36,657
(Blue Team also got the Stealing Card.)

719
00:28:36,657 --> 00:28:38,497
- Stealing Card. - We got the same card.

720
00:28:38,497 --> 00:28:39,927
It's the same card.

721
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,097
- We need to remove a name tag. - Go remove a name tag.

722
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:44,527
- Let's go now. - An opponent's?

723
00:28:44,527 --> 00:28:45,557
Let's go.

724
00:28:46,327 --> 00:28:47,557
Sweet pumpkin sikhye.

725
00:28:48,057 --> 00:28:49,457
They also have fruit juice.

726
00:28:49,757 --> 00:28:51,727
- We have to finish this at once. - At once.

727
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:54,157
It's hard to finish the mission at once.

728
00:28:54,657 --> 00:28:57,197
- What are you doing here? - We're...

729
00:28:57,197 --> 00:28:58,427
(Jae Seok removes Gary's name tag.)

730
00:29:00,027 --> 00:29:01,827
- What was that? - It's okay.

731
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:03,097
Isn't it cheating?

732
00:29:03,497 --> 00:29:05,927
You're not out. We had to do this to use this card.

733
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:06,997
So he's not out?

734
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:08,657
- Did you already clear the mission? - We did.

735
00:29:08,657 --> 00:29:10,797
- Really? - We know you're joking.

736
00:29:10,797 --> 00:29:12,457
No, it's the truth.

737
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:15,457
- No. - What are you doing?

738
00:29:15,457 --> 00:29:17,657
You don't have to remove our name tags.

739
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:19,357
- You're so ill-mannered. - That's true.

740
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,397
We eliminated yours only because it was our mission.

741
00:29:21,397 --> 00:29:23,427
- Let's pick M. - Please give us M.

742
00:29:23,427 --> 00:29:26,127
You want M? Here you go.

743
00:29:26,357 --> 00:29:28,097
It's not "Em" in "Emily" but the letter M.

744
00:29:28,497 --> 00:29:29,897
(What a lame joke.)

745
00:29:29,897 --> 00:29:31,557
- My goodness. - We're done for.

746
00:29:31,557 --> 00:29:34,197
- We collected most of them. - We have four more to go.

747
00:29:34,197 --> 00:29:35,227
(Blue Team needs four more consonants.)

748
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:37,527
- We have a long way to go. - What about...

749
00:29:37,557 --> 00:29:39,697
- M? - That's not a bad idea.

750
00:29:39,797 --> 00:29:41,757
- Y would be also good. - Let's choose M or Y.

751
00:29:41,757 --> 00:29:43,327
- What do you think? - I think Y would be good.

752
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,197
- We'll need Y. - We want Y.

753
00:29:45,197 --> 00:29:46,697
It's the most commonly used consonant.

754
00:29:47,427 --> 00:29:49,627
- We got Y. - Good

755
00:29:49,627 --> 00:29:51,497
- You shouldn't pick the card. - Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

756
00:29:51,497 --> 00:29:52,857
- Rock-paper... - You can pick.

757
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,197
I'm luckier than you two.

758
00:29:54,197 --> 00:29:55,727
(Luckier Gary chooses a card.)

759
00:29:57,327 --> 00:29:58,427
I want the one in the middle.

760
00:29:58,627 --> 00:30:00,697
- Gosh. - Don't open it!

761
00:30:01,727 --> 00:30:03,627
- Looting Card! - This is a good one.

762
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:06,127
- It's a good one. - Do we have to remove a name card?

763
00:30:06,127 --> 00:30:07,457
Do we just take a consonant?

764
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:08,957
These are the consonants the other teams have.

765
00:30:08,957 --> 00:30:10,527
Let's take Red Team's M.

766
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:12,057
- Okay. Red Team has a lot. - Let's take it from Red Team.

767
00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:13,627
- M. - Let's take M.

768
00:30:13,627 --> 00:30:15,157
- We want Red Team's M! - We want Red Team's M!

769
00:30:15,157 --> 00:30:17,027
- Okay. - We did great.

770
00:30:17,027 --> 00:30:18,527
- High-five. - We have good teamwork.

771
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:20,527
- My goodness. - We're doing wonderful.

772
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,357
Hold on. Green Team used...

773
00:30:23,127 --> 00:30:24,927
their chance card...

774
00:30:25,727 --> 00:30:29,027
and took M from you.

775
00:30:29,797 --> 00:30:32,027
- They took ours away? - Yes.

776
00:30:32,127 --> 00:30:34,457
- They had the Looting Card. - Yes, they did.

777
00:30:34,827 --> 00:30:36,857
- This is unbelievable. - Green Team used...

778
00:30:36,857 --> 00:30:38,357
the Looting Card and took your M.

779
00:30:38,357 --> 00:30:40,027
If they took our M...

780
00:30:40,627 --> 00:30:43,057
(She's shaking her hand.)

781
00:30:44,997 --> 00:30:47,457
Why did they take ours?

782
00:30:47,797 --> 00:30:49,927
Does it mean Blue Team doesn't have M?

783
00:30:49,927 --> 00:30:51,097
(Red Team loses M.)

784
00:30:51,097 --> 00:30:52,257
Then...

785
00:30:53,297 --> 00:30:54,357
(What mission will they do here?)

786
00:30:54,357 --> 00:30:55,397
Hangeul...

787
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:58,557
What should we do here?

788
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:01,857
(Karaoke and jump ropes?)

789
00:31:01,957 --> 00:31:03,857
What should we do here?

790
00:31:03,857 --> 00:31:06,597
The mission you'll do here is "Hop and Sing".

791
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:08,697
- "Hop and Sing"? - What is that?

792
00:31:09,027 --> 00:31:10,797
I'll explain. You'll choose...

793
00:31:10,797 --> 00:31:13,727
a song first and pick a consonant.

794
00:31:13,727 --> 00:31:16,997
When the lyrics contain that consonant, you should jump.

795
00:31:16,997 --> 00:31:18,497
- Which one should we choose? - Choose a song...

796
00:31:18,497 --> 00:31:20,457
that's not difficult to sing.

797
00:31:20,527 --> 00:31:21,697
How about "Rotating, Rotating, Rotating"?

798
00:31:21,697 --> 00:31:22,927
- "Rotating, Rotating, Rotating"? - That's a good one.

799
00:31:22,927 --> 00:31:24,227
It's fine as long as you don't pick D or K.

800
00:31:24,227 --> 00:31:25,457
That's right.

801
00:31:25,457 --> 00:31:26,827
Just don't pick those.

802
00:31:27,097 --> 00:31:28,557
- Shall I start? - Yes.

803
00:31:29,697 --> 00:31:31,927
- Is it D? - It's game over if it's D.

804
00:31:31,927 --> 00:31:32,957
It's fine as long as it's not D or K.

805
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,997
(Let's avoid D and K.)

806
00:31:37,857 --> 00:31:39,627
- It's J. - It's J.

807
00:31:39,627 --> 00:31:41,197
(He picks J.)

808
00:31:41,197 --> 00:31:42,897
- Shall I try jumping the rope once? - Okay.

809
00:31:43,997 --> 00:31:45,097
- Okay. - That's good.

810
00:31:45,097 --> 00:31:46,927
That's right.

811
00:31:48,057 --> 00:31:49,327
Do you want the rope to go over you?

812
00:31:49,827 --> 00:31:50,957
There's one J in the second phrase.

813
00:31:51,627 --> 00:31:54,327
(J appears at the start.)

814
00:31:54,327 --> 00:31:56,427
- "When the sun sets". - Shall we move the rope over him?

815
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,857
When the sun sets

816
00:32:00,857 --> 00:32:05,157
The moon appears in the sky

817
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:08,357
The sun rises again

818
00:32:09,457 --> 00:32:11,557
Flowers bloom

819
00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:13,727
- Flowers bloom - Flowers bloom

820
00:32:13,727 --> 00:32:17,097
Birds fly

821
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:19,127
Birds fly

822
00:32:19,127 --> 00:32:21,157
They move

823
00:32:21,157 --> 00:32:23,027
- They move - You must jump here.

824
00:32:24,327 --> 00:32:27,297
(After losing their concentration, they're suddenly in a rush.)

825
00:32:27,857 --> 00:32:29,857
- They move - You must jump here.

826
00:32:29,857 --> 00:32:31,097
(He gets hit.)

827
00:32:31,097 --> 00:32:32,497
Goodness.

828
00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:34,357
You should have jumped.

829
00:32:34,457 --> 00:32:36,597
(They don't know what to do.)

830
00:32:36,597 --> 00:32:37,797
Goodness.

831
00:32:38,297 --> 00:32:40,657
- Why were you singing along? - I'm sorry.

832
00:32:40,657 --> 00:32:45,027
- Again, rotating - Again, rotating

833
00:32:45,027 --> 00:32:46,127
Rotating

834
00:32:46,127 --> 00:32:48,897
Rotating

835
00:32:50,227 --> 00:32:51,857
- Rotating - Rotating

836
00:32:51,857 --> 00:32:53,127
Everyone, sing along.

837
00:32:53,427 --> 00:32:57,397
- Rotating like dancing - Rotating like dancing

838
00:32:59,057 --> 00:33:00,127
Is it over?

839
00:33:00,527 --> 00:33:01,657
What's the score?

840
00:33:01,657 --> 00:33:03,457
(Blue Team made three mistakes.)

841
00:33:03,657 --> 00:33:06,897
(They must score a minimum of 93 points.)

842
00:33:09,727 --> 00:33:11,097
- What's the score? - It's 95.

843
00:33:12,227 --> 00:33:13,397
We did it.

844
00:33:13,397 --> 00:33:15,327
- What's the perfect score? - We lost one point.

845
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,457
We lost three points.

846
00:33:16,697 --> 00:33:18,827
- What's the score? - Your score is 92 points.

847
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,027
You made it.

848
00:33:20,027 --> 00:33:22,757
(Blue Team succeeds.)

849
00:33:22,757 --> 00:33:23,797
By the way,

850
00:33:23,797 --> 00:33:26,057
he didn't sing that well.

851
00:33:26,057 --> 00:33:27,597
- He didn't sing that well. - I'm also surprised.

852
00:33:27,597 --> 00:33:29,327
I think I sang quite well.

853
00:33:30,957 --> 00:33:33,827
You didn't deserve 95 points.

854
00:33:33,827 --> 00:33:35,027
I hardly score as high as 95 points.

855
00:33:35,027 --> 00:33:37,197
I usually score 98 points, so I wondered what happened.

856
00:33:38,157 --> 00:33:39,457
I wondered why I only scored 95 points.

857
00:33:39,457 --> 00:33:40,657
My goodness.

858
00:33:40,927 --> 00:33:42,127
Let's go with L.

859
00:33:42,627 --> 00:33:44,197
This is going too smoothly.

860
00:33:44,797 --> 00:33:45,897
I'll pick one.

861
00:33:47,097 --> 00:33:48,457
Everything is fine except Better Luck Next Time.

862
00:33:48,897 --> 00:33:50,197
Let's take a look.

863
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:53,097
Let's take a look.

864
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:54,227
- It's Consonant Card. - It's Consonant Card.

865
00:33:54,297 --> 00:33:55,757
- This is amazing. - We can just acquire one.

866
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:58,427
- Do we acquire one for free? - Let's get K.

867
00:33:58,427 --> 00:34:00,497
We have to get two more consonants.

868
00:34:00,627 --> 00:34:02,457
- K? - What's this?

869
00:34:03,427 --> 00:34:05,357
- What do we do? - We have to get two more.

870
00:34:05,897 --> 00:34:08,057
- Things are going too smoothly. - They're going way too smoothly.

871
00:34:08,097 --> 00:34:09,857
I'm anxious because things are going too well.

872
00:34:10,097 --> 00:34:11,997
How can things go this smoothly?

873
00:34:11,997 --> 00:34:13,457
We're almost done with the game.

874
00:34:14,497 --> 00:34:16,727
- What else can we do? - Is it almost over for us?

875
00:34:17,297 --> 00:34:18,457
What's going on?

876
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:20,557
(Consonants the teams have acquired)

877
00:34:20,557 --> 00:34:21,997
It's Friend Chance.

878
00:34:22,657 --> 00:34:26,297
Pick one of these questions.

879
00:34:26,357 --> 00:34:29,267
You can acquire the first consonant of the person's answer.

880
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,427
- I see. - Wait.

881
00:34:30,427 --> 00:34:32,767
We need to acquire K, so we need an answer such as "curry".

882
00:34:32,857 --> 00:34:34,027
Pick the question.

883
00:34:34,027 --> 00:34:35,397
Which consonants do we need?

884
00:34:36,557 --> 00:34:38,527
What do you think of when you look at me?

885
00:34:38,527 --> 00:34:40,697
- What's this? - One of my songs goes,

886
00:34:40,697 --> 00:34:43,227
I want to eat curry
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

887
00:34:43,227 --> 00:34:44,627
Trust me this once.

888
00:34:44,627 --> 00:34:46,357
- Okay, you do it. - I'll call Skull.

889
00:34:46,357 --> 00:34:47,397
You'll do well.

890
00:34:47,397 --> 00:34:48,897
(He calls Skull.)

891
00:34:50,027 --> 00:34:52,097
- Hey, man. - Hey, man.

892
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:54,527
- Hello. - Hey, number one singer in Jamaica.

893
00:34:54,527 --> 00:34:56,457
When I ask you...

894
00:34:56,557 --> 00:34:58,767
a question, please answer it.

895
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:00,057
- It's a quiz. - Is this what it is?

896
00:35:00,357 --> 00:35:02,657
The melody goes like this.

897
00:35:04,027 --> 00:35:06,797
I want to eat something today

898
00:35:06,957 --> 00:35:08,927
Here's my question.

899
00:35:09,127 --> 00:35:11,457
What reminds you the most when you look at me?

900
00:35:12,497 --> 00:35:13,857
(The dice is thrown.)

901
00:35:13,857 --> 00:35:16,657
(No, the curry is thrown.)

902
00:35:17,097 --> 00:35:18,657
Curry.

903
00:35:20,597 --> 00:35:23,057
(Green Team succeeds.)

904
00:35:23,057 --> 00:35:24,397
This is amazing.

905
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:27,767
Number one singer in Jamaica.

906
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:29,597
You acquired K.

907
00:35:30,227 --> 00:35:32,527
What's going on with us?

908
00:35:32,957 --> 00:35:35,297
Things are going too smoothly.

909
00:35:35,297 --> 00:35:36,927
No one stole anything from us today, either.

910
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,457
No one is stealing.

911
00:35:40,267 --> 00:35:41,357
What's this?

912
00:35:41,897 --> 00:35:43,357
(What's the mission prepared on the rooftop of a building?)

913
00:35:43,357 --> 00:35:44,957
- What's this? - A microscope?

914
00:35:46,297 --> 00:35:47,457
"The 10-Dollar Mystery".

915
00:35:47,997 --> 00:35:49,267
Four syllabi that disappeared.

916
00:35:49,457 --> 00:35:53,727
Among the 28 letters created by King Sejong, you must find 4 letters...

917
00:35:53,727 --> 00:35:55,327
that disappeared on the 10-dollar bill.

918
00:35:55,327 --> 00:35:56,457
I see.

919
00:35:56,457 --> 00:35:58,727
By using the consonants that you've acquired so far...

920
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:01,357
and by using the tools that are given to you,

921
00:36:01,357 --> 00:36:04,197
find four letters that are hidden on the 10-dollar bill.

922
00:36:04,197 --> 00:36:05,597
There's no time limit.

923
00:36:05,927 --> 00:36:07,957
While one member stays in a squat position,

924
00:36:08,557 --> 00:36:10,997
the rest of the members have to look for the four letters.

925
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:12,657
We can use our mobile phones.

926
00:36:13,557 --> 00:36:15,027
We can use them?

927
00:36:15,027 --> 00:36:16,727
- Yes. - We can use all of them.

928
00:36:16,797 --> 00:36:18,357
Magnifying glass is better, Hae Jin.

929
00:36:18,357 --> 00:36:19,767
You're right.

930
00:36:19,797 --> 00:36:20,957
- May I start? - Get ready.

931
00:36:20,957 --> 00:36:22,697
Start.

932
00:36:23,027 --> 00:36:25,827
They're here at the bottom.

933
00:36:25,827 --> 00:36:27,897
- Where at the bottom? - Right here.

934
00:36:28,697 --> 00:36:29,997
I don't think I can last long.

935
00:36:29,997 --> 00:36:31,027
(He laughs.)

936
00:36:31,027 --> 00:36:32,327
This is actually hard.

937
00:36:33,297 --> 00:36:34,857
(Their look is strong enough to pierce the 10-dollar bill.)

938
00:36:34,857 --> 00:36:37,397
This is quite difficult.

939
00:36:37,997 --> 00:36:40,267
I can't see anything with the binoculars.

940
00:36:40,527 --> 00:36:42,767
I don't think I can hold it for 30 minutes.

941
00:36:42,857 --> 00:36:44,027
You can't?

942
00:36:44,157 --> 00:36:46,097
- Maybe for 15 minutes. - Wait a little.

943
00:36:46,157 --> 00:36:47,597
How do I find them through the binoculars?

944
00:36:47,597 --> 00:36:48,927
You said you'll hold it for 30 minutes.

945
00:36:48,927 --> 00:36:50,557
I can't even hold it for five minutes.

946
00:36:51,267 --> 00:36:52,427
It's really difficult.

947
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:55,697
(He realises it too late and regrets it.)

948
00:36:56,197 --> 00:36:57,397
Give us a little more time.

949
00:36:57,397 --> 00:36:59,497
(It doesn't seem easy to solve.)

950
00:36:59,497 --> 00:37:01,457
- Why is it so hard? - Gosh.

951
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:04,197
Goodness.

952
00:37:04,197 --> 00:37:06,057
Did you hide them?

953
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,327
- That's the original bill. - Really?

954
00:37:07,457 --> 00:37:09,127
This is great.

955
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:11,157
This is amazing.

956
00:37:12,157 --> 00:37:14,057
- I can see it clearly with this. - You're right.

957
00:37:14,397 --> 00:37:16,197
- It's magnified by that much? - Yes.

958
00:37:16,597 --> 00:37:19,057
Kwang Soo, this is the best to use. Look.

959
00:37:19,057 --> 00:37:21,097
(Joon is almost dying.)

960
00:37:21,797 --> 00:37:22,827
(Goodness)

961
00:37:23,997 --> 00:37:25,227
This is incredible.

962
00:37:26,267 --> 00:37:27,397
Are you done yet?

963
00:37:27,727 --> 00:37:29,627
We're almost there.

964
00:37:30,127 --> 00:37:32,027
These look like...

965
00:37:32,027 --> 00:37:33,127
(Please hurry and find them.)

966
00:37:34,227 --> 00:37:35,697
- Hello. - Hello.

967
00:37:36,597 --> 00:37:38,527
This is "Hop and Sing".

968
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,597
Who jumps the rope?

969
00:37:40,597 --> 00:37:42,397
The person who sings will jump the rope.

970
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:45,727
(In that case...)

971
00:37:45,727 --> 00:37:47,227
- You do it. - Should I sing?

972
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:48,857
- I don't want to sing. - You should still do it.

973
00:37:48,857 --> 00:37:50,057
Shouldn't someone else do it?

974
00:37:50,527 --> 00:37:53,227
The person who sings well and has strength should do it.

975
00:37:53,227 --> 00:37:55,267
(That person is Jong Kook.)

976
00:37:55,997 --> 00:37:57,097
Is it me?

977
00:37:57,097 --> 00:37:58,697
(He accepts the reality of the situation.)

978
00:37:59,897 --> 00:38:01,457
Are we really on the same team?

979
00:38:02,097 --> 00:38:03,727
I feel like I'm serving them today.

980
00:38:03,727 --> 00:38:05,457
(He seems like a servant serving three ladies.)

981
00:38:05,727 --> 00:38:07,597
Why don't you do it, Yoon Hee?

982
00:38:07,597 --> 00:38:09,457
- What song should I sing? - Go ahead, Yoon Hee.

983
00:38:09,457 --> 00:38:11,457
Why don't I sing "Before Sadness Comes"?

984
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:12,767
- It's easy to sing. - That sounds good.

985
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,767
- I'm scared. - What is it?

986
00:38:15,457 --> 00:38:17,267
- It's D. - There will a lot of those.

987
00:38:17,497 --> 00:38:18,957
There're going to be a lot in the lyrics.

988
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:20,657
There will be a lot of them in the lyrics.

989
00:38:21,357 --> 00:38:22,997
What if the first word starts with a D?

990
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:24,927
- There it is. - There's already a D.

991
00:38:26,797 --> 00:38:27,827
- Sing loudly. - Go.

992
00:38:28,997 --> 00:38:32,057
Whenever I think of you

993
00:38:32,057 --> 00:38:34,527
The last syllable.

994
00:38:34,527 --> 00:38:36,097
- The last one. - That's right.

995
00:38:36,097 --> 00:38:42,997
- You always seem close yet so far - There's another one.

996
00:38:42,997 --> 00:38:44,027
Here it comes.

997
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:49,427
When we meet, you say you love me

998
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,427
- Here comes another one. - Go.

999
00:38:51,427 --> 00:38:52,427
Move the rope this way.

1000
00:38:52,427 --> 00:38:57,197
When we part, I predict something sad

1001
00:38:58,427 --> 00:38:59,427
(Red Team made five mistakes.)

1002
00:38:59,427 --> 00:39:00,527
- It's over. - The end.

1003
00:39:00,597 --> 00:39:04,767
(They must score a minimum of 95 points.)

1004
00:39:06,957 --> 00:39:09,457
Goodness.

1005
00:39:09,457 --> 00:39:12,297
- You should sing once. - I don't want to.

1006
00:39:12,557 --> 00:39:13,767
- Do you want to sing? - Why don't you sing, Ji Hyo?

1007
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:14,897
You should sing since you're brave, Ji Hyo.

1008
00:39:15,057 --> 00:39:17,457
I'd like to sing "Sunset Glow" by Lee Moon Se.

1009
00:39:17,597 --> 00:39:18,767
I'll pick one.

1010
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:20,157
I'll pick a really good one.

1011
00:39:20,657 --> 00:39:21,727
Wait and see.

1012
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:24,227
Can you please avoid B?

1013
00:39:24,227 --> 00:39:26,397
(Please avoid B for this song.)

1014
00:39:27,857 --> 00:39:28,897
It's B.

1015
00:39:28,897 --> 00:39:30,997
(He picks B.)

1016
00:39:32,697 --> 00:39:33,927
Goodness.

1017
00:39:33,927 --> 00:39:36,157
(Why did he pick B of all consonants?)

1018
00:39:36,157 --> 00:39:38,527
- Get ready. - It starts with a B.

1019
00:39:39,157 --> 00:39:43,127
- When I look at the sunset glow - The sunset glow

1020
00:39:43,127 --> 00:39:44,297
Jump at the end.

1021
00:39:44,297 --> 00:39:47,457
It reminds me of your sad face

1022
00:39:47,897 --> 00:39:50,597
I call out your name

1023
00:39:50,697 --> 00:39:54,697
- Only the silent sunset glows - Only the silent sunset glows

1024
00:39:56,197 --> 00:39:57,627
- Did she make it? - She did.

1025
00:39:57,627 --> 00:39:59,857
- The score has to be over 90. - Is that possible?

1026
00:39:59,857 --> 00:40:02,457
You lost nine points from your mistakes.

1027
00:40:03,227 --> 00:40:05,427
(Did she make nine mistakes?)

1028
00:40:05,457 --> 00:40:07,357
- I can't tell you - That one is okay.

1029
00:40:08,457 --> 00:40:12,557
(She forgot about the consonants after the vowels.)

1030
00:40:12,557 --> 00:40:17,897
Only the silent sunset glows

1031
00:40:18,357 --> 00:40:20,857
- You missed the ones after vowels. - That's right.

1032
00:40:21,397 --> 00:40:23,767
(If she made nine mistakes...)

1033
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:24,897
I don't think we succeeded this time.

1034
00:40:24,897 --> 00:40:27,157
(The score has to be a minimum of 99 points.)

1035
00:40:28,557 --> 00:40:31,327
- The score is... - It's 100 points.

1036
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:35,157
(Ji Hyo scores 100 points.)

1037
00:40:36,427 --> 00:40:38,357
I sang badly but still scored 100.

1038
00:40:38,357 --> 00:40:40,997
She was completely out of tune.

1039
00:40:40,997 --> 00:40:43,227
- The final score is over 90 points? - How is this possible?

1040
00:40:43,227 --> 00:40:45,157
- Anyway, we made it. - We did.

1041
00:40:45,157 --> 00:40:47,267
- You're good. - Good job.

1042
00:40:47,267 --> 00:40:48,357
We did it.

1043
00:40:48,357 --> 00:40:50,327
You can take a consonant you'd like.

1044
00:40:51,097 --> 00:40:53,057
- We'd like to acquire P. - Okay.

1045
00:40:53,057 --> 00:40:55,797
(Consonants Red Team acquired)

1046
00:40:58,627 --> 00:41:00,527
- Are you being punished? - I'm so sorry.

1047
00:41:00,527 --> 00:41:02,767
(Blue Team fails due to Green Team's interruption.)

1048
00:41:03,657 --> 00:41:04,897
Get ready, set, go.

1049
00:41:05,827 --> 00:41:07,297
Are they hidden somewhere here?

1050
00:41:07,297 --> 00:41:09,227
(They're about to pierce the 10-dollar bill.)

1051
00:41:12,197 --> 00:41:13,597
How do we find four of them?

1052
00:41:13,997 --> 00:41:15,127
I know the answer.

1053
00:41:15,127 --> 00:41:16,297
Did you find them?

1054
00:41:18,427 --> 00:41:20,327
(Already?)

1055
00:41:23,027 --> 00:41:25,427
(Here they are.)

1056
00:41:26,197 --> 00:41:28,327
- Kwang Soo, correct. - Okay!

1057
00:41:28,957 --> 00:41:30,457
- Did you find them? - Did you?

1058
00:41:30,457 --> 00:41:32,197
He found them. How did he find them?

1059
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:33,557
Are they really in here?

1060
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:40,827
Kwang Soo, you did a good job.

1061
00:41:40,927 --> 00:41:43,357
We'll take P and choose a card.

1062
00:41:43,897 --> 00:41:45,267
Who wants to pick?

1063
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:47,197
- You may finish the game with this. - We have almost all.

1064
00:41:47,197 --> 00:41:48,827
- I'm not very lucky with this. - Hae Jin.

1065
00:41:48,827 --> 00:41:50,357
- Yes. - Pick a card, please.

1066
00:41:50,357 --> 00:41:51,357
Shall I?

1067
00:41:51,457 --> 00:41:53,527
- We're doing really well. - You may make us win this game.

1068
00:41:53,527 --> 00:41:56,057
If you pick the Consonant Card, the game is over.

1069
00:41:56,057 --> 00:41:57,657
- Do you think I'll pick that card? - Yes.

1070
00:41:58,127 --> 00:41:59,697
You should just avoid Better Luck Next Time.

1071
00:41:59,697 --> 00:42:00,727
This is awesome.

1072
00:42:01,327 --> 00:42:04,897
(Let's see how lucky Hae Jin is.)

1073
00:42:07,097 --> 00:42:08,127
Let me see.

1074
00:42:08,127 --> 00:42:09,197
(He's disappointed.)

1075
00:42:09,197 --> 00:42:10,197
Please show us.

1076
00:42:11,197 --> 00:42:12,827
Please show us. What did he pick?

1077
00:42:12,827 --> 00:42:13,827
It's Better Luck Next Time.

1078
00:42:13,827 --> 00:42:15,227
(He can't believe it.)

1079
00:42:15,227 --> 00:42:16,227
Are you sure?

1080
00:42:17,097 --> 00:42:18,327
Isn't it Better Luck "This" Time?

1081
00:42:18,597 --> 00:42:20,727
(Hae Jin proved to be unlucky as well.)

1082
00:42:22,357 --> 00:42:23,697
- He chose the wrong one. - What happens then?

1083
00:42:23,697 --> 00:42:25,797
- You picked Better Luck Next Time. - What happens now?

1084
00:42:25,997 --> 00:42:27,427
Why are you so happy?

1085
00:42:27,427 --> 00:42:29,627
I'm glad that you have two unlucky guys.

1086
00:42:29,627 --> 00:42:32,267
We just have one consonant left.

1087
00:42:32,267 --> 00:42:34,327
We could have skipped the next place.

1088
00:42:34,627 --> 00:42:36,457
It would've been nice if we obtained a consonant.

1089
00:42:36,457 --> 00:42:38,227
(Blue Team is much closer to victory.)

1090
00:42:39,197 --> 00:42:41,457
I wish we had the Consonant Card...

1091
00:42:43,057 --> 00:42:44,327
or any other cards.

1092
00:42:44,327 --> 00:42:46,327
(Staff runs towards Blue Team.)

1093
00:42:47,267 --> 00:42:48,357
(Knocking)

1094
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,597
- They're not the culprits. - They aren't?

1095
00:42:51,227 --> 00:42:55,157
Another team took Ch from you with the Looting Card.

1096
00:42:55,157 --> 00:42:57,397
You can't use the car.

1097
00:42:57,627 --> 00:42:58,827
- What? - Excuse me?

1098
00:42:58,827 --> 00:43:00,297
(They have to get off the car.)

1099
00:43:00,797 --> 00:43:02,697
- They're so mean. - We can't use the car?

1100
00:43:02,697 --> 00:43:04,427
- Should we get off? - Yes.

1101
00:43:04,427 --> 00:43:06,227
- Gosh. - All of a sudden?

1102
00:43:06,827 --> 00:43:09,197
- I'm getting upset. - This is ridiculous.

1103
00:43:09,197 --> 00:43:10,897
- Me too. - Goodness.

1104
00:43:10,897 --> 00:43:12,697
But we were already in the car.

1105
00:43:12,697 --> 00:43:14,397
You're not robbers or something.

1106
00:43:14,727 --> 00:43:16,267
(What has happened?)

1107
00:43:16,397 --> 00:43:18,557
Can they really kick us out of the car?

1108
00:43:18,827 --> 00:43:20,727
(A minute ago)

1109
00:43:20,727 --> 00:43:23,527
(Green Team passed "The 10-Dollar Mystery" and picked a card.)

1110
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:27,697
(Looting Card)

1111
00:43:27,997 --> 00:43:29,227
Target the team with the most.

1112
00:43:29,627 --> 00:43:31,597
- One, two, three. - Ch!

1113
00:43:32,727 --> 00:43:34,897
They are mean.

1114
00:43:34,897 --> 00:43:36,427
(They feel robbed.)

1115
00:43:37,127 --> 00:43:38,597
- Shall we take a taxi? - We can't.

1116
00:43:38,597 --> 00:43:41,267
- We can't take a taxi. - We don't have T.

1117
00:43:42,897 --> 00:43:45,057
Since they took Ch, we can't use a car.

1118
00:43:45,097 --> 00:43:46,597
They're bad guys.

1119
00:43:46,597 --> 00:43:47,597
(They lost C.)

1120
00:43:48,057 --> 00:43:50,027
We need to turn left.

1121
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:51,497
- Are you sure? - Well...

1122
00:43:51,897 --> 00:43:53,097
Where is it?

1123
00:43:53,157 --> 00:43:54,697
Anguk-dong is far from here.

1124
00:43:54,827 --> 00:43:57,457
- Can we take a bus? - Yes, we can.

1125
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:01,897
But it's complicated to go there by bus.

1126
00:44:01,897 --> 00:44:03,697
(Sighing)

1127
00:44:04,127 --> 00:44:05,527
I don't know what to do.

1128
00:44:05,527 --> 00:44:07,127
It's really difficult to get there.

1129
00:44:07,127 --> 00:44:08,927
Only if we had Ch.

1130
00:44:08,927 --> 00:44:11,257
(Wait, we can use the Friend Chance.)

1131
00:44:12,327 --> 00:44:16,227
(You can obtain the first consonant of your friend's answer.)

1132
00:44:16,227 --> 00:44:17,957
- "What do I remind you of?" - "What do I remind you of?"

1133
00:44:18,897 --> 00:44:21,197
"What do I remind you of?" "Chambada"?

1134
00:44:21,427 --> 00:44:23,427
- Who would call me that? - May I call Dong Hwi?

1135
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,157
- Yes, call him. - May I?

1136
00:44:25,157 --> 00:44:26,197
Call him.

1137
00:44:26,327 --> 00:44:27,727
- Hello. - Dong Hwi.

1138
00:44:28,027 --> 00:44:29,897
- Hi. Where are you? - I'm shooting Running Man.

1139
00:44:30,227 --> 00:44:31,327
(Laughing)

1140
00:44:31,327 --> 00:44:33,497
- We have a question for you. - Dong Hwi.

1141
00:44:33,797 --> 00:44:36,527
- Hello, Hae Jin. - Hello. How are you?

1142
00:44:36,727 --> 00:44:37,727
I'm good.

1143
00:44:37,827 --> 00:44:40,297
You know I was...

1144
00:44:40,597 --> 00:44:43,157
- shooting on an island. - I know.

1145
00:44:43,157 --> 00:44:45,927
They used to call me by a certain nickname.

1146
00:44:46,257 --> 00:44:48,727
Gosh, I...

1147
00:44:49,097 --> 00:44:51,897
(Dong Hwi, please. We trust you.)

1148
00:44:52,597 --> 00:44:55,627
I didn't watch "Three Meals a Day" regularly.

1149
00:44:55,657 --> 00:44:56,727
(No way!)

1150
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:59,297
You didn't? Wait a moment.

1151
00:44:59,457 --> 00:45:00,857
I'll give you a tip.

1152
00:45:00,897 --> 00:45:02,557
What do I remind you of?

1153
00:45:02,957 --> 00:45:04,127
You should answer to that question.

1154
00:45:05,997 --> 00:45:09,157
(Dong Hwi, please.)

1155
00:45:09,157 --> 00:45:12,327
(We desperately need Ch.)

1156
00:45:13,327 --> 00:45:14,997
Oh, I see.

1157
00:45:15,057 --> 00:45:16,957
Chambada.

1158
00:45:17,327 --> 00:45:19,257
(He said it.)

1159
00:45:19,257 --> 00:45:21,597
- That's correct. Thank you. - Dong Hwi.

1160
00:45:21,597 --> 00:45:23,027
- Thanks. - Thank you.

1161
00:45:24,957 --> 00:45:26,597
- Please give us Ch. - Ch?

1162
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:28,527
This was too harsh.

1163
00:45:28,527 --> 00:45:30,997
Now, we can take the car again, right?

1164
00:45:31,197 --> 00:45:33,227
Thank goodness we got Ch back.

1165
00:45:33,757 --> 00:45:34,797
(Number of consonants per team)

1166
00:45:34,797 --> 00:45:36,457
(Blue Team is leading.)

1167
00:45:37,097 --> 00:45:39,227
(Green Team and Blue Team are near the Gyeongbokgung Palace.)

1168
00:45:39,227 --> 00:45:40,227
(Red Team is in Hwa-dong.)

1169
00:45:40,227 --> 00:45:43,297
- You are doing so well. - Good job.

1170
00:45:43,527 --> 00:45:45,427
We got the Consonant Card.

1171
00:45:45,427 --> 00:45:47,527
"Galgaekkun", "kkotjam"...

1172
00:45:47,527 --> 00:45:49,827
(If you do a proper role play with three words, it's a success.)

1173
00:45:49,827 --> 00:45:51,727
("Galgaekkun", "kkotjam" and "gasibeosi")

1174
00:45:52,127 --> 00:45:54,657
Is "galgaekkun" Gary?

1175
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,527
- It seems to befit him. - "Galgaekkun"?

1176
00:45:57,527 --> 00:45:59,027
"Gasibeosi" sounds like...

1177
00:45:59,327 --> 00:46:00,627
Is it a marriage proposal?

1178
00:46:00,627 --> 00:46:03,157
- Don't you think it means "sweet"? - Sweet.

1179
00:46:03,157 --> 00:46:04,597
- Do you think so? - Don't you think?

1180
00:46:04,597 --> 00:46:08,927
Since your voice is "gasibeosi", I can have "kkotjam".

1181
00:46:09,957 --> 00:46:13,127
That's so sweet to hear but there is a "galgaekkun" here.

1182
00:46:13,127 --> 00:46:15,227
(He used "galgaekkun" correctly.)

1183
00:46:15,227 --> 00:46:16,527
I'll disturb you all.

1184
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:18,197
(Do you want a piece of "galgaekkun"?)

1185
00:46:18,197 --> 00:46:19,957
- I'll disturb you all. - Is that correct?

1186
00:46:20,157 --> 00:46:21,457
It was close but you failed.

1187
00:46:21,457 --> 00:46:22,727
- Why? - I'll explain why.

1188
00:46:22,727 --> 00:46:25,557
- Maybe we got "kkotjam" wrong. - "Gasibeosi" means...

1189
00:46:26,327 --> 00:46:28,527
- "a husband and a wife". - Does it?

1190
00:46:28,897 --> 00:46:32,627
"Kkotjam" means "the wedding night".

1191
00:46:32,627 --> 00:46:33,927
(They finally realise the meanings.)

1192
00:46:33,927 --> 00:46:35,227
How could we guess...

1193
00:46:38,357 --> 00:46:39,627
Hae Jin.

1194
00:46:39,627 --> 00:46:41,527
(Hey, you.)

1195
00:46:44,097 --> 00:46:45,927
- Do you have only one left? - Yes.

1196
00:46:45,927 --> 00:46:47,357
We need three.

1197
00:46:47,357 --> 00:46:49,727
- We need to hurry then. - We have to finish.

1198
00:46:49,797 --> 00:46:51,557
Let's hurry.

1199
00:46:52,957 --> 00:46:54,057
What are these words?

1200
00:46:55,027 --> 00:46:56,297
I don't know them at all.

1201
00:46:57,427 --> 00:46:59,657
What are "sageurangi", "ttukbyeolssi" and "putnat"?

1202
00:47:00,227 --> 00:47:03,427
"Putnat" means "a stranger". I think so.

1203
00:47:03,427 --> 00:47:04,427
You're right.

1204
00:47:05,257 --> 00:47:07,757
"Ttukbyeolssi" is me.

1205
00:47:08,427 --> 00:47:09,897
Because "Ttuk" sounds like a grasshopper...

1206
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,457
and "byeol" means a star in Korean.

1207
00:47:12,027 --> 00:47:13,627
(He's making up the meaning.)

1208
00:47:13,627 --> 00:47:16,497
- What's "sageurangi"? - Can I say that word on TV?

1209
00:47:16,697 --> 00:47:17,797
Doesn't it mean...

1210
00:47:18,427 --> 00:47:20,157
- "Sageurangi". - here?

1211
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:23,727
- Stop it. - But it sounds like that.

1212
00:47:23,727 --> 00:47:25,097
That sounds similar to armpit.

1213
00:47:25,097 --> 00:47:26,627
That's the crotch.

1214
00:47:26,627 --> 00:47:28,427
(Oh, I see.)

1215
00:47:29,857 --> 00:47:31,327
Hey, "ttukbyeolssi",

1216
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,827
- we're "putnat". - Good.

1217
00:47:32,827 --> 00:47:33,827
- How is it? - Do you want to "sageurangi"?

1218
00:47:33,827 --> 00:47:35,057
(Laughing)

1219
00:47:36,597 --> 00:47:40,127
(It may sound a bit weird, but not too bad.)

1220
00:47:41,457 --> 00:47:43,457
- This is it. We're ready. - Okay.

1221
00:47:44,927 --> 00:47:46,297
Ready, go.

1222
00:47:46,327 --> 00:47:49,357
- Jong Kook... - Is this our last pick?

1223
00:47:49,357 --> 00:47:50,727
We're doing the role play.

1224
00:47:50,727 --> 00:47:52,127
Are you choosing one of the three?

1225
00:47:52,127 --> 00:47:54,897
- What are you doing? We're acting. - You have to choose one?

1226
00:47:54,897 --> 00:47:55,997
They're coming again.

1227
00:47:56,327 --> 00:47:57,527
(Green Team arrives late.)

1228
00:47:58,157 --> 00:47:59,357
- We'll start. - We will.

1229
00:47:59,697 --> 00:48:02,227
When it was "kkokkoji", you used to be so cool.

1230
00:48:02,327 --> 00:48:03,327
But how do I look now?

1231
00:48:03,397 --> 00:48:05,827
You're "bingchungmatda" like a "yeorikkun".

1232
00:48:05,927 --> 00:48:08,157
- It's right. - That sounds realistic.

1233
00:48:08,157 --> 00:48:09,197
- That sounds offensive. - It's a success.

1234
00:48:09,197 --> 00:48:10,557
(Red Team gets it right.)

1235
00:48:10,557 --> 00:48:12,027
Great. We made it.

1236
00:48:12,197 --> 00:48:14,427
- Pick a card. - Let's do this.

1237
00:48:14,827 --> 00:48:16,957
You won't take ours again, will you?

1238
00:48:16,957 --> 00:48:19,027
- It's the Consonant Card. - By the way, why...

1239
00:48:19,027 --> 00:48:20,127
(Consonant Card)

1240
00:48:20,457 --> 00:48:21,997
(Red Team adds K and T.)

1241
00:48:22,697 --> 00:48:24,297
We still have to get one more.

1242
00:48:24,927 --> 00:48:26,427
(Right. There is the Friend Chance.)

1243
00:48:27,297 --> 00:48:28,997
(They head to a corner to use the Chance.)

1244
00:48:29,727 --> 00:48:30,897
They're finished.

1245
00:48:30,897 --> 00:48:32,797
(Finished?)

1246
00:48:33,557 --> 00:48:35,427
- We'll start. - We'll take the challenge.

1247
00:48:35,427 --> 00:48:38,157
If you succeed this time, you're finished.

1248
00:48:39,097 --> 00:48:41,627
- Hi, "ttukbyeolssi". - Hi.

1249
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:44,127
- We're "putnat" but... - Yes.

1250
00:48:44,697 --> 00:48:48,627
please lend me a "sageurangi".

1251
00:48:48,627 --> 00:48:51,227
(They used the words correctly.)

1252
00:48:51,227 --> 00:48:53,097
- A "sageurangi". - You're correct.

1253
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,827
(Blue Team succeeds.)

1254
00:48:55,597 --> 00:48:57,197
(That was close.)

1255
00:48:57,197 --> 00:48:58,557
- Great. - Well...

1256
00:48:58,857 --> 00:49:00,557
(Blue Team obtains T and completes all consonants.)

1257
00:49:00,557 --> 00:49:01,557
We got T.

1258
00:49:02,497 --> 00:49:04,157
(Blue Team will get a big advantage in the final race.)

1259
00:49:07,297 --> 00:49:08,627
(National Hangeul Museum)

1260
00:49:08,627 --> 00:49:13,157
The final race will be "Bag-Stealing Project".

1261
00:49:13,157 --> 00:49:14,157
"Bag-Stealing Project"?

1262
00:49:14,157 --> 00:49:15,197
(Bag-Stealing Project)

1263
00:49:15,527 --> 00:49:19,427
The last survivor should open a chest located in the final spot...

1264
00:49:19,427 --> 00:49:21,897
and take the object that's inside to win.

1265
00:49:22,197 --> 00:49:25,257
Each password number is hidden in five bags.

1266
00:49:25,527 --> 00:49:29,197
You'll see the bags the moment someone is eliminated.

1267
00:49:29,197 --> 00:49:30,897
(Every time you solve a problem, you can erase a consonant.)

1268
00:49:30,897 --> 00:49:34,427
Find clue boxes hidden everywhere and solve the problems.

1269
00:49:34,427 --> 00:49:36,427
If you get the answer correct,

1270
00:49:36,427 --> 00:49:39,957
you can remove a consonant entirely.

1271
00:49:40,527 --> 00:49:41,727
So this isn't Name Tag Elimination.

1272
00:49:42,697 --> 00:49:43,997
So this isn't Name Tag Elimination.

1273
00:49:44,227 --> 00:49:47,627
But I only have two syllables.

1274
00:49:47,827 --> 00:49:49,227
(Laughing)

1275
00:49:49,927 --> 00:49:51,727
- He has only one consonant. - If someone picks H...

1276
00:49:51,927 --> 00:49:53,097
Are you kidding?

1277
00:49:53,097 --> 00:49:54,127
Is there no tearing today?

1278
00:49:54,127 --> 00:49:56,927
When someone is eliminated, you can have a bag.

1279
00:49:57,257 --> 00:49:58,497
The person carrying the bag...

1280
00:49:58,697 --> 00:50:01,927
is qualified to tear the others' name tags off.

1281
00:50:01,927 --> 00:50:03,457
The person carrying the bag?

1282
00:50:05,357 --> 00:50:08,527
The person who has all five bags at last...

1283
00:50:08,527 --> 00:50:10,957
will be the winner today.

1284
00:50:11,127 --> 00:50:13,897
When you remove a consonant,

1285
00:50:13,897 --> 00:50:16,027
your team members will lose it too.

1286
00:50:16,027 --> 00:50:17,157
I see.

1287
00:50:17,157 --> 00:50:19,427
So the consonant is removed from the game entirely.

1288
00:50:19,897 --> 00:50:21,127
(What consonants do our members have?)

1289
00:50:22,157 --> 00:50:24,727
Let's go to your starting places now.

1290
00:50:24,727 --> 00:50:25,727
Okay.

1291
00:50:25,827 --> 00:50:31,227
I don't understand how people get it by listening to the rules once.

1292
00:50:31,627 --> 00:50:32,727
I don't either.

1293
00:50:33,257 --> 00:50:35,327
Everyone seems to understand it, but why can't I?

1294
00:50:36,327 --> 00:50:38,857
Is there a consonant that the other teams have but we don't?

1295
00:50:39,197 --> 00:50:42,557
M, R... There is R, too.

1296
00:50:42,627 --> 00:50:45,357
I can see that Red Team has an advantage.

1297
00:50:45,427 --> 00:50:48,027
(He laughs.)

1298
00:50:48,027 --> 00:50:49,697
I just had to eat three meals a day before.

1299
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:54,797
(Eating three meals a day was so easy back then.)

1300
00:50:54,797 --> 00:50:57,427
I don't quite understand because I just had to eat.

1301
00:50:57,427 --> 00:51:00,057
You were able to sing but you can't understand this?

1302
00:51:00,427 --> 00:51:02,627
I'd rather pull out weeds.

1303
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,197
(There are no weeds or meals but consonants.)

1304
00:51:04,197 --> 00:51:06,097
It's so complicated.

1305
00:51:06,327 --> 00:51:08,197
- Hae Jin... - What should I do?

1306
00:51:08,197 --> 00:51:11,227
In the boxes, there are quizzes...

1307
00:51:11,227 --> 00:51:13,527
- Just go around and find them. - You need to find the boxes.

1308
00:51:13,527 --> 00:51:14,697
Find the boxes.

1309
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:16,697
- So I just need to find the boxes. - Right.

1310
00:51:16,697 --> 00:51:17,857
(I'm not very used to Running Man.)

1311
00:51:19,557 --> 00:51:21,497
Blue Team,

1312
00:51:21,627 --> 00:51:25,197
you successfully acquired 14 consonants.

1313
00:51:25,327 --> 00:51:26,357
Yes, we got all of them.

1314
00:51:26,357 --> 00:51:30,027
Here is a huge benefit that's given to you.

1315
00:51:30,027 --> 00:51:33,327
(What's the special benefit given to them?)

1316
00:51:33,327 --> 00:51:35,357
It's Save a Consonant Card.

1317
00:51:35,357 --> 00:51:37,257
(Save a Consonant Card)

1318
00:51:37,257 --> 00:51:38,927
Save a Consonant Card?

1319
00:51:38,997 --> 00:51:42,557
You must discuss and decide...

1320
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:45,097
which consonant to be eliminated...

1321
00:51:45,257 --> 00:51:47,757
only when it's eliminated twice.

1322
00:51:47,757 --> 00:51:49,097
Which one do we have the most?

1323
00:51:49,097 --> 00:51:51,397
Isn't it J? There's J from Lee Joon.

1324
00:51:51,557 --> 00:51:54,557
- Hae Jin. That's right. - Hae Jin.

1325
00:51:54,727 --> 00:51:55,927
There's no J in my name.

1326
00:51:56,257 --> 00:51:58,627
- The three of us have it. - Let's not choose J.

1327
00:51:58,627 --> 00:52:00,827
There's no J in my name.

1328
00:52:00,997 --> 00:52:02,127
How about G?

1329
00:52:02,527 --> 00:52:04,927
Yu Hae Jin. There's no G.

1330
00:52:05,197 --> 00:52:08,057
- Let's decide on J. - Let's think more about it.

1331
00:52:08,857 --> 00:52:11,327
- It's because... - We have J the most.

1332
00:52:11,627 --> 00:52:13,497
Did you decide on J?

1333
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,957
- J is the best choice. - It is.

1334
00:52:16,557 --> 00:52:17,697
Okay.

1335
00:52:17,697 --> 00:52:18,957
(Won't you respect the opinion of a minority?)

1336
00:52:18,957 --> 00:52:20,297
I'm disappointed.

1337
00:52:21,427 --> 00:52:23,227
I'll put a curse on them.

1338
00:52:23,827 --> 00:52:25,027
Let's go.

1339
00:52:25,457 --> 00:52:27,527
Put the name tag on for Yoon Hee.

1340
00:52:27,927 --> 00:52:29,997
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1341
00:52:30,097 --> 00:52:33,997
(Who will be the final winner of the race?)

1342
00:52:36,827 --> 00:52:38,797
We need to find the box.

1343
00:52:38,797 --> 00:52:40,057
(He searches.)

1344
00:52:43,297 --> 00:52:45,897
There's a box that's labelled R.

1345
00:52:45,897 --> 00:52:48,297
(Hae Jin looks for the box.)

1346
00:52:48,357 --> 00:52:50,397
- Are you looking carefully? - Yes.

1347
00:52:51,127 --> 00:52:52,827
Don't just walk around.

1348
00:52:53,597 --> 00:52:54,757
You must search.

1349
00:52:55,357 --> 00:52:56,757
Is it in a box?

1350
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:59,757
(You can eliminate the consonants if you find the box first.)

1351
00:53:01,527 --> 00:53:03,827
I bet I'll be eliminated once someone finds it.

1352
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,597
Get rid of Y.

1353
00:53:06,197 --> 00:53:08,197
Y? Okay. What's going on?

1354
00:53:08,357 --> 00:53:10,357
What's going on?

1355
00:53:11,527 --> 00:53:14,827
Jae Seok eliminated H.

1356
00:53:14,827 --> 00:53:15,957
(His prediction was correct.)

1357
00:53:15,957 --> 00:53:18,227
How can this happen as soon as I say it?

1358
00:53:19,357 --> 00:53:21,027
(Just a moment ago)

1359
00:53:21,227 --> 00:53:22,427
Here it is.

1360
00:53:22,427 --> 00:53:24,627
- Here it is. - Did you find it?

1361
00:53:24,627 --> 00:53:27,627
(Jae Seok finds the box within a few minutes.)

1362
00:53:27,927 --> 00:53:30,097
Choose a Korean word with this meaning.

1363
00:53:30,097 --> 00:53:31,657
A shape that became soft after being steamed.

1364
00:53:32,497 --> 00:53:34,427
Pusungpusung, hamulhamul.

1365
00:53:34,957 --> 00:53:37,657
(Choose which type of food it is and try it.)

1366
00:53:37,657 --> 00:53:38,727
Don't people say it's soft and slippery?

1367
00:53:38,727 --> 00:53:39,857
- Soft and slippery. - Right.

1368
00:53:39,857 --> 00:53:41,097
- I bet it's hamulhamul. - Hamulhamul.

1369
00:53:41,197 --> 00:53:42,457
The answer is two.

1370
00:53:42,457 --> 00:53:44,457
(Jae Seok chooses number 2.)

1371
00:53:44,457 --> 00:53:45,997
(Is hamulhamul the answer?)

1372
00:53:45,997 --> 00:53:47,527
- It's delicious. - It's delicious.

1373
00:53:47,527 --> 00:53:48,527
(Hamulhamul is the answer.)

1374
00:53:48,527 --> 00:53:51,027
(Jae Seok answers correctly.)

1375
00:53:53,097 --> 00:53:55,327
Our team is amazing today.

1376
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:57,257
- We're off to a good start. - That was so quick.

1377
00:53:57,327 --> 00:53:59,057
- It's perfect. - It's a good start.

1378
00:53:59,057 --> 00:54:00,497
(Kwang Soo tried the other food.)

1379
00:54:00,497 --> 00:54:01,897
We should go with something we don't have.

1380
00:54:02,597 --> 00:54:04,427
Shall we eliminate H?

1381
00:54:05,027 --> 00:54:06,327
Why did you eat that?

1382
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:08,627
(Is he torturing himself on purpose?)

1383
00:54:08,627 --> 00:54:10,057
How did you put it in this?

1384
00:54:10,057 --> 00:54:11,357
What was in it?

1385
00:54:11,357 --> 00:54:12,727
It's wasabi.

1386
00:54:13,057 --> 00:54:15,697
- Let's eliminate H, Hae Jin. - H?

1387
00:54:15,957 --> 00:54:18,057
- We have it, too. - Right.

1388
00:54:18,057 --> 00:54:19,357
Are you saying that's better?

1389
00:54:19,627 --> 00:54:21,557
We have to eliminate Haha.

1390
00:54:21,597 --> 00:54:22,727
- Okay. - It's because...

1391
00:54:22,727 --> 00:54:24,697
- we must get the bag. - Okay.

1392
00:54:24,697 --> 00:54:25,997
- Are you okay with it? - To get the bag?

1393
00:54:25,997 --> 00:54:27,727
Gosh, it's only been...

1394
00:54:27,727 --> 00:54:30,357
- five minutes since we started. - It doesn't matter.

1395
00:54:30,357 --> 00:54:32,557
- Goodness. - I don't care about that.

1396
00:54:32,557 --> 00:54:33,597
H.

1397
00:54:33,597 --> 00:54:35,497
- You're the team leader. - I know.

1398
00:54:35,497 --> 00:54:37,797
- We still have J left. - Okay.

1399
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,557
Jae Seok eliminated H.

1400
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:42,197
- Jae Seok eliminated H. - We have H.

1401
00:54:42,197 --> 00:54:43,597
We have H.

1402
00:54:47,227 --> 00:54:48,297
Goodness.

1403
00:54:48,757 --> 00:54:49,997
Haha is eliminated.

1404
00:54:50,727 --> 00:54:52,127
Haha is eliminated.

1405
00:54:52,157 --> 00:54:54,227
(Laughing)

1406
00:54:55,127 --> 00:54:56,527
Goodbye, Haha.

1407
00:54:57,097 --> 00:55:02,757
(Haha is eliminated within five minutes.)

1408
00:55:04,197 --> 00:55:09,297
(His stage name should have been longer and more complicated.)

1409
00:55:09,327 --> 00:55:10,557
Haha is eliminated.

1410
00:55:10,597 --> 00:55:13,027
(Laughing)

1411
00:55:13,257 --> 00:55:16,057
Gosh, I feel bad for him.

1412
00:55:16,357 --> 00:55:17,527
Poor Haha.

1413
00:55:17,527 --> 00:55:19,097
It was a bit cruel.

1414
00:55:19,097 --> 00:55:21,027
I know, but it couldn't be helped.

1415
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:22,427
Let's look for yours.

1416
00:55:22,427 --> 00:55:24,597
There should be a bag.

1417
00:55:24,957 --> 00:55:26,157
We must...

1418
00:55:26,427 --> 00:55:28,927
find the bag first.

1419
00:55:29,357 --> 00:55:31,957
Let's find the bag

1420
00:55:32,357 --> 00:55:33,927
Bag, bag

1421
00:55:34,327 --> 00:55:36,127
Let's find the bag

1422
00:55:39,427 --> 00:55:40,927
I found it.

1423
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:45,597
(It's a bright box.)

1424
00:55:45,597 --> 00:55:47,627
I've heard of norujam before.

1425
00:55:47,697 --> 00:55:48,997
- Nabijam? - I mean norujam.

1426
00:55:48,997 --> 00:55:50,327
- Norujam? - Yes.

1427
00:55:50,327 --> 00:55:52,427
Noru, a roe deer, is an herbivore.

1428
00:55:52,857 --> 00:55:56,127
Doesn't it wake up immediately when its predator appears?

1429
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:57,397
Isn't it norujam?

1430
00:55:57,397 --> 00:55:58,457
Number one.

1431
00:55:58,457 --> 00:56:01,697
(Yoon Hee chooses number 1.)

1432
00:56:02,197 --> 00:56:03,557
I should eat some, too.

1433
00:56:03,557 --> 00:56:06,757
(What's the type of sleep during which you wake up constantly?)

1434
00:56:06,757 --> 00:56:09,357
(Yoon Hee answers correctly.)

1435
00:56:09,627 --> 00:56:11,097
What's in the other one?

1436
00:56:11,527 --> 00:56:12,597
(She's exactly like Kwang Soo.)

1437
00:56:12,597 --> 00:56:13,727
It's wasabi.

1438
00:56:13,727 --> 00:56:16,027
(She's exactly like Kwang Soo.)

1439
00:56:18,197 --> 00:56:19,827
We must choose L...

1440
00:56:19,827 --> 00:56:21,227
so that we can eliminate them.

1441
00:56:21,227 --> 00:56:23,497
- I'll choose L. - L.

1442
00:56:23,627 --> 00:56:26,057
Yoon Hee eliminated L.

1443
00:56:26,057 --> 00:56:27,197
L?

1444
00:56:28,197 --> 00:56:30,797
- Yoon Hee eliminated L. - L? Me?

1445
00:56:31,057 --> 00:56:32,827
That's me.

1446
00:56:32,957 --> 00:56:36,157
We can get the bag now that we eliminated one person.

1447
00:56:36,157 --> 00:56:37,797
- Really? - We must find the bag.

1448
00:56:37,797 --> 00:56:39,727
Our team is the target.

1449
00:56:39,727 --> 00:56:41,757
(This is what it means when the rich gets richer, the poor gets poorer.)

1450
00:56:41,757 --> 00:56:43,327
Our team is the target.

1451
00:56:45,497 --> 00:56:46,497
(His name tag is almost empty.)

1452
00:56:46,497 --> 00:56:48,627
- L is eliminated. - Seok Jin.

1453
00:56:48,627 --> 00:56:49,857
What do I do?

1454
00:56:49,857 --> 00:56:50,897
(Tearing)

1455
00:56:52,057 --> 00:56:53,327
What do I do?

1456
00:56:53,857 --> 00:56:54,957
What did you do?

1457
00:56:54,957 --> 00:56:56,827
(How can he tear off his name tag so suddenly?)

1458
00:56:56,827 --> 00:56:58,227
- Did you find it? - What are you doing?

1459
00:56:59,327 --> 00:57:01,357
I have to find the bag.

1460
00:57:01,527 --> 00:57:05,027
(Kwang Soo was searching for the bag.)

1461
00:57:05,027 --> 00:57:06,357
(He looks around.)

1462
00:57:06,357 --> 00:57:07,957
Why did she eliminate L?

1463
00:57:09,057 --> 00:57:10,427
It was to eliminate Gary.

1464
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,057
It's because...

1465
00:57:12,197 --> 00:57:14,557
(What's this?)

1466
00:57:15,457 --> 00:57:18,257
(Kwang Soo finds the bag.)

1467
00:57:18,257 --> 00:57:20,097
Here's the bag.

1468
00:57:20,457 --> 00:57:21,657
What's this?

1469
00:57:23,497 --> 00:57:25,027
(As he obtained Y, he can tear off name tags.)

1470
00:57:25,027 --> 00:57:27,597
I found it.

1471
00:57:27,597 --> 00:57:29,697
(As he obtained Y, he can tear off name tags.)

1472
00:57:29,957 --> 00:57:31,357
I can take off any name tags, right?

1473
00:57:31,757 --> 00:57:33,357
Our team is the target.

1474
00:57:33,357 --> 00:57:34,927
(He finds Seok Jin.)

1475
00:57:35,227 --> 00:57:38,497
- L is eliminated. - Seok Jin, what should I do?

1476
00:57:38,597 --> 00:57:41,157
(Seok Jin is eliminated.)

1477
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:42,497
What are you doing?

1478
00:57:42,497 --> 00:57:45,757
(Goodbye, Seok Jin.)

1479
00:57:45,997 --> 00:57:48,497
(Don't take off my name tag.)

1480
00:57:49,097 --> 00:57:51,527
(There's a total of 2 bags to be found.)

1481
00:57:51,527 --> 00:57:55,127
I haven't even done much today.

1482
00:57:55,627 --> 00:57:56,827
Kwang Soo!

1483
00:57:58,297 --> 00:58:02,257
(Seok Jin and Haha from Green Team are eliminated.)

1484
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:09,927
(He's planning to eliminate Ji Hyo who has many consonants.)

1485
00:58:12,227 --> 00:58:13,897
Hey, hey.

1486
00:58:13,897 --> 00:58:16,797
- Gary. - I'm the only one left on the team.

1487
00:58:18,427 --> 00:58:19,897
(They run away.)

1488
00:58:21,697 --> 00:58:24,157
(He'll catch anyone he can.)

1489
00:58:26,197 --> 00:58:28,497
- Is Kwang Soo taking off name tags? - Be careful.

1490
00:58:28,497 --> 00:58:31,627
Kwang Soo can take off name tags right now.

1491
00:58:31,627 --> 00:58:32,897
Really?

1492
00:58:33,327 --> 00:58:36,227
- Where does the elevator lead to? - I can't believe this.

1493
00:58:36,997 --> 00:58:40,097
(He changes his target to Yoon Hee.)

1494
00:58:40,097 --> 00:58:41,297
Did he take off their name tags?

1495
00:58:42,627 --> 00:58:46,297
(Unlike the others, she runs faster than anyone.)

1496
00:58:46,297 --> 00:58:47,927
She's so fast.

1497
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:50,697
She's so fast. Wait.

1498
00:58:50,797 --> 00:58:53,827
(She runs quickly as if the fire alarm went off.)

1499
00:58:55,327 --> 00:58:56,427
Yoon Hee.

1500
00:58:56,427 --> 00:59:00,427
(She runs much faster than Kwang Soo.)

1501
00:59:00,427 --> 00:59:01,697
Goodness.

1502
00:59:03,057 --> 00:59:04,057
(She takes big steps.)

1503
00:59:04,997 --> 00:59:06,197
Goodness.

1504
00:59:06,197 --> 00:59:08,827
(What will be the result of this chase?)

1505
00:59:10,497 --> 00:59:12,427
Someone must have found the bag.

1506
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:14,757
(People are searching for the bag in the library.)

1507
00:59:14,757 --> 00:59:16,897
Kwang Soo must have the bag.

1508
00:59:17,097 --> 00:59:20,357
(He searches anyway without understanding the rules.)

1509
00:59:20,627 --> 00:59:23,397
Hae Jin is quite meticulous.

1510
00:59:25,057 --> 00:59:28,427
(He finds a box instead of the bag.)

1511
00:59:28,897 --> 00:59:29,957
I found it.

1512
00:59:30,157 --> 00:59:32,397
(Goodness)

1513
00:59:32,727 --> 00:59:35,257
(How did he find that box?)

1514
00:59:35,597 --> 00:59:38,397
Choose a Korean word with this meaning.

1515
00:59:38,397 --> 00:59:39,527
(He feels bad for Hae Jin but continues to answer the question.)

1516
00:59:39,527 --> 00:59:42,427
"It's awkward and embarrassing."

1517
00:59:42,457 --> 00:59:46,627
(Why is being on a variety show so difficult?)

1518
00:59:46,627 --> 00:59:49,197
How did he find it? I passed by that spot.

1519
00:59:49,427 --> 00:59:50,757
Goodness.

1520
00:59:51,457 --> 00:59:52,727
I choose number one.

1521
00:59:52,727 --> 00:59:56,397
(Jong Kook chooses number 1.)

1522
00:59:56,397 --> 00:59:58,627
(He answers correctly.)

1523
00:59:58,627 --> 00:59:59,797
Okay.

1524
01:00:00,197 --> 01:00:01,697
That was the correct answer.

1525
01:00:02,357 --> 01:00:06,627
(He's still chasing after her.)

1526
01:00:08,627 --> 01:00:09,697
(Did something just pass by?)

1527
01:00:09,697 --> 01:00:10,727
What's wrong?

1528
01:00:10,727 --> 01:00:11,997
(Did something just pass by?)

1529
01:00:12,357 --> 01:00:13,727
I found the bag.

1530
01:00:14,497 --> 01:00:18,097
(Really? You found the bag?)

1531
01:00:18,097 --> 01:00:20,327
What happens if you find the bag?

1532
01:00:20,327 --> 01:00:22,197
(Then what happens?)

1533
01:00:23,027 --> 01:00:24,797
Who found it?

1534
01:00:24,997 --> 01:00:26,257
Goodness.

1535
01:00:26,257 --> 01:00:27,727
(Hae Jin is in a completely different world.)

1536
01:00:28,127 --> 01:00:31,697
(Everyone is so good at playing the game.)

1537
01:00:32,627 --> 01:00:36,257
(Unlike Hae Jin, they get competitive.)

1538
01:00:37,597 --> 01:00:40,957
(Go easy on me. I only have one consonant left.)

1539
01:00:41,957 --> 01:00:44,357
Kwang Soo, why are you going easy on Jong Kook?

1540
01:00:44,357 --> 01:00:46,157
I'm doing a mission right now.

1541
01:00:46,157 --> 01:00:47,457
(He's another one with many consonants.)

1542
01:00:47,457 --> 01:00:49,227
- Did you eat it? - Yes.

1543
01:00:50,727 --> 01:00:52,827
I'm doing a mission.

1544
01:00:52,997 --> 01:00:55,097
Let me finish the mission.

1545
01:00:55,097 --> 01:00:56,457
I haven't made my decision yet.

1546
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:58,157
- Let me decide first. - Okay.

1547
01:00:58,497 --> 01:01:00,527
- Let me decide first. - I don't think I'll go anywhere.

1548
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:02,597
Never mind. Take your time.

1549
01:01:02,597 --> 01:01:05,057
Okay, wait a minute. Do I choose first?

1550
01:01:05,897 --> 01:01:07,727
What does Kwang Soo have?

1551
01:01:07,927 --> 01:01:09,597
I have a lot left.

1552
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,327
(Hae Jin is looking for a box.)

1553
01:01:11,327 --> 01:01:13,327
Let me make my decision first.

1554
01:01:13,327 --> 01:01:16,097
- Kwang Soo, come on. - It's because I'm excited.

1555
01:01:16,227 --> 01:01:17,827
Let me make my decision first.

1556
01:01:17,927 --> 01:01:20,127
- Give me a second. - Hold still.

1557
01:01:20,127 --> 01:01:21,827
Hae Jin!

1558
01:01:21,827 --> 01:01:23,697
What? Why?

1559
01:01:24,127 --> 01:01:26,497
What do you mean "why"?

1560
01:01:26,497 --> 01:01:27,997
What is it?

1561
01:01:28,897 --> 01:01:30,297
- What is it? - I'm dying here.

1562
01:01:32,557 --> 01:01:34,057
- Hae Jin! - What?

1563
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:35,227
Help me.

1564
01:01:35,227 --> 01:01:36,297
What do you want me to do?

1565
01:01:36,297 --> 01:01:37,657
What are you talking about? Come over here.

1566
01:01:38,197 --> 01:01:40,497
- Help me! - What's wrong?

1567
01:01:41,027 --> 01:01:43,397
- Help me! - I choose S.

1568
01:01:43,397 --> 01:01:44,927
Jong Kook has removed S.

1569
01:01:45,657 --> 01:01:48,257
- It has been removed. - Okay.

1570
01:01:48,427 --> 01:01:50,497
Why were you ignoring me?

1571
01:01:50,497 --> 01:01:52,197
I didn't know what was going on.

1572
01:01:52,197 --> 01:01:53,597
I got caught by Jong Kook.

1573
01:01:53,597 --> 01:01:56,297
- Hae Jin can't take them off. - Oh, I get it.

1574
01:01:56,297 --> 01:01:58,597
- You want to take his off, right? - Yes.

1575
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:00,357
- I can't do it, though. - What?

1576
01:02:00,357 --> 01:02:02,557
He's so much stronger than me.

1577
01:02:02,727 --> 01:02:04,697
- Are you giving up just like that? - Hold on.

1578
01:02:04,697 --> 01:02:06,827
- Do you see how he's treating me? - Fine, just hold on.

1579
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:08,597
There's nothing in here.

1580
01:02:08,597 --> 01:02:10,097
- I can't find anything. - What is it this time?

1581
01:02:10,097 --> 01:02:13,257
(The bell rings.)

1582
01:02:14,027 --> 01:02:16,357
- Jong Kook has removed S. - S?

1583
01:02:17,497 --> 01:02:18,497
- S? - S?

1584
01:02:18,897 --> 01:02:19,897
That means...

1585
01:02:19,897 --> 01:02:21,197
That's me, then.

1586
01:02:21,197 --> 01:02:22,997
(It's not good news.)

1587
01:02:23,157 --> 01:02:24,257
Gosh.

1588
01:02:26,657 --> 01:02:31,127
(Now, Ji Hyo only has Y and J left.)

1589
01:02:33,127 --> 01:02:35,497
(There's something there.)

1590
01:02:40,457 --> 01:02:44,197
(Ji Hyo finds a bag.)

1591
01:02:45,527 --> 01:02:46,597
I got it.

1592
01:02:47,227 --> 01:02:48,297
All right.

1593
01:02:48,597 --> 01:02:49,827
"Let me see..."

1594
01:02:49,827 --> 01:02:51,027
(She hides it in a secret place.)

1595
01:02:51,597 --> 01:02:55,497
(Hae Jin is struggling to get Jong Kook off of Kwang Soo.)

1596
01:02:57,457 --> 01:02:59,097
- Hae Jin! - I'm helping.

1597
01:02:59,097 --> 01:03:00,697
Can you try harder?

1598
01:03:00,697 --> 01:03:01,897
Harder? Got it.

1599
01:03:03,627 --> 01:03:05,657
- You're almost there. - I got it.

1600
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:07,157
- Am I supposed to take it off? - Do it.

1601
01:03:07,157 --> 01:03:08,797
- Go for it. - Okay.

1602
01:03:08,897 --> 01:03:10,127
Okay.

1603
01:03:10,857 --> 01:03:13,327
(He's quick to answer even in a situation like this.)

1604
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:16,597
I did it.

1605
01:03:17,897 --> 01:03:19,897
He's so strong.

1606
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,127
Work with me.

1607
01:03:22,127 --> 01:03:24,397
(This is the biggest one I've caught in my life.)

1608
01:03:25,157 --> 01:03:27,197
We're almost there.

1609
01:03:27,197 --> 01:03:28,857
We're almost done.

1610
01:03:28,857 --> 01:03:30,257
(Jong Kook locks Kwang Soo between his legs.)

1611
01:03:30,927 --> 01:03:32,557
(He catches Kwang Soo off guard.)

1612
01:03:33,097 --> 01:03:35,357
(It's a deadly technique.)

1613
01:03:35,527 --> 01:03:37,057
- Help me. - Oh, right.

1614
01:03:37,057 --> 01:03:39,097
(Please... Please help me.)

1615
01:03:40,527 --> 01:03:41,997
(Let me see...)

1616
01:03:41,997 --> 01:03:43,427
(He's struggling.)

1617
01:03:44,727 --> 01:03:46,657
- Hae Jin! - Gosh.

1618
01:03:47,427 --> 01:03:49,257
- How's that? - Help.

1619
01:03:49,827 --> 01:03:52,157
(This is a variety show, not a UFC match.)

1620
01:03:52,157 --> 01:03:53,827
Hae Jin!

1621
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:56,027
Come on.

1622
01:03:56,357 --> 01:03:57,697
- Gosh. - Get him off of me.

1623
01:03:58,227 --> 01:03:59,457
- He's amazing. - Can you...

1624
01:03:59,897 --> 01:04:01,857
- What? - Stop saying that...

1625
01:04:01,857 --> 01:04:03,297
and get his hands off of me.

1626
01:04:04,027 --> 01:04:05,127
(What more do you want from me?)

1627
01:04:05,127 --> 01:04:08,027
Please, someone come and help me.

1628
01:04:08,197 --> 01:04:10,197
- It's 2 against 1. - I know, right?

1629
01:04:10,197 --> 01:04:11,297
We outnumber him.

1630
01:04:12,957 --> 01:04:14,397
I didn't think he would be this strong.

1631
01:04:15,257 --> 01:04:18,457
("Extreme Job": Catching the Running Man Tiger)

1632
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,597
(Here comes the next wave.)

1633
01:04:23,597 --> 01:04:25,127
Jong Kook, give me a break.

1634
01:04:25,557 --> 01:04:26,697
Hae Jin, hold on.

1635
01:04:27,027 --> 01:04:29,127
Hae Jin! Where'd you go?

1636
01:04:29,127 --> 01:04:30,397
This is too exhausting.

1637
01:04:31,097 --> 01:04:32,197
Let me take a break.

1638
01:04:32,197 --> 01:04:33,827
I have to lie down.

1639
01:04:33,827 --> 01:04:35,997
(He gave up working with his legs.)

1640
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,357
- You can do it. - How's that?

1641
01:04:37,357 --> 01:04:38,597
You're almost there.

1642
01:04:38,597 --> 01:04:40,157
(He's struggling again.)

1643
01:04:40,157 --> 01:04:41,327
I can't breathe.

1644
01:04:41,927 --> 01:04:42,957
Gosh.

1645
01:04:43,897 --> 01:04:45,257
Stop punching me there!

1646
01:04:46,427 --> 01:04:51,597
(Consecutive hits to his groin make him vulnerable.)

1647
01:04:52,427 --> 01:04:54,227
(That's all the exercise I need for the rest of this year.)

1648
01:04:54,227 --> 01:04:55,357
That was crazy.

1649
01:04:55,427 --> 01:04:56,497
Good job, Hae Jin.

1650
01:04:56,497 --> 01:04:58,457
- Wasn't that a foul? - That was good, Hae Jin.

1651
01:05:01,427 --> 01:05:03,427
(He's sweating buckets.)

1652
01:05:03,427 --> 01:05:05,457
- I'm sweating so much. - Goodness.

1653
01:05:06,127 --> 01:05:08,057
We did great work.

1654
01:05:08,057 --> 01:05:10,257
(Jong Kook is out of the game. Meanwhile...)

1655
01:05:10,257 --> 01:05:11,297
Oh, gosh.

1656
01:05:11,297 --> 01:05:13,927
(Jong Kook is out of the game. Meanwhile...)

1657
01:05:14,797 --> 01:05:16,027
I found a hint,

1658
01:05:16,197 --> 01:05:18,197
- but guessed the wrong answer. - Me, too.

1659
01:05:18,827 --> 01:05:20,527
- What's that? - Jong Kook is out?

1660
01:05:20,527 --> 01:05:22,127
(What do you mean Jong Kook is out?)

1661
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:23,157
What should we do?

1662
01:05:24,027 --> 01:05:25,997
Should I go for Gary first?

1663
01:05:25,997 --> 01:05:28,427
(Jae Seok got a question right and is thinking of his next move.)

1664
01:05:28,427 --> 01:05:29,827
Or should I get rid of M instead?

1665
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:35,897
Kim Jong Kook is out.

1666
01:05:36,157 --> 01:05:37,857
(What?)

1667
01:05:37,857 --> 01:05:38,957
What happened?

1668
01:05:39,457 --> 01:05:41,557
That's good news. Kwang Soo must have done it.

1669
01:05:42,557 --> 01:05:43,957
(Gary also guessed the correct answer.)

1670
01:05:43,957 --> 01:05:45,557
- Is S out of the game already? - Yes.

1671
01:05:48,727 --> 01:05:52,427
What should I do?

1672
01:05:52,427 --> 01:05:53,657
Kwang Soo also has a K.

1673
01:05:53,897 --> 01:05:55,197
Kim Jong Kook is out.

1674
01:05:56,697 --> 01:05:58,457
I just thought of something dangerous.

1675
01:05:58,757 --> 01:06:00,057
I was about to remove K.

1676
01:06:00,897 --> 01:06:03,357
I forgot that it's in my name as well.

1677
01:06:04,227 --> 01:06:06,657
I forgot what my actual name was.

1678
01:06:06,657 --> 01:06:08,727
(Get it together, Gary.)

1679
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:11,527
I think I should go for J.

1680
01:06:11,527 --> 01:06:13,057
(J has the Save a Consonant Card.)

1681
01:06:13,057 --> 01:06:14,157
There's no other way.

1682
01:06:15,327 --> 01:06:19,097
Yu Jae Seok has removed J.

1683
01:06:19,097 --> 01:06:20,257
Oh, no.

1684
01:06:20,257 --> 01:06:23,297
(I only have N left.)

1685
01:06:23,297 --> 01:06:25,597
- Yu Jae Seok has removed J. - Gosh.

1686
01:06:25,597 --> 01:06:32,457
(Every member of Team Red has a J in their names.)

1687
01:06:32,457 --> 01:06:33,457
I only have one left.

1688
01:06:33,457 --> 01:06:35,127
I should go for Y. I need to eliminate Kwang Soo.

1689
01:06:35,127 --> 01:06:37,557
I should get rid of the strong opponents first.

1690
01:06:39,097 --> 01:06:40,597
(Hae Jin finally managed to get a question right.)

1691
01:06:40,597 --> 01:06:42,497
It's Y.

1692
01:06:42,497 --> 01:06:43,657
That's you.

1693
01:06:43,657 --> 01:06:46,057
Kwang Soo, Y will be removed from your name.

1694
01:06:46,057 --> 01:06:48,457
- Let's go for Gary. - What does he have?

1695
01:06:48,457 --> 01:06:49,597
- It's R. - R?

1696
01:06:50,227 --> 01:06:51,427
Okay.

1697
01:06:51,427 --> 01:06:53,527
- R has already been removed. - Let's do K then.

1698
01:06:54,097 --> 01:06:55,427
- K? - Wait, no!

1699
01:06:55,427 --> 01:06:56,597
That's in my name, too.

1700
01:06:57,497 --> 01:06:58,557
I'm sorry.

1701
01:06:59,597 --> 01:07:01,427
(Song Ji Hyo is out.)

1702
01:07:01,427 --> 01:07:02,457
I'm out?

1703
01:07:02,627 --> 01:07:03,997
Y has been removed.

1704
01:07:04,257 --> 01:07:06,257
Song Ji Hyo is out.

1705
01:07:07,257 --> 01:07:08,357
Does the package belong to me now?

1706
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:09,957
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1707
01:07:10,397 --> 01:07:11,557
Keep this for me.

1708
01:07:11,557 --> 01:07:12,827
(The package Ji Hyo found goes to Gary.)

1709
01:07:13,797 --> 01:07:17,497
(Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, Seok Jin and Haha are out.)

1710
01:07:18,057 --> 01:07:22,657
(The only remaining consonants are K, M and N.)

1711
01:07:26,197 --> 01:07:27,397
(Gary can now tear name tags.)

1712
01:07:27,397 --> 01:07:29,357
This keeps slipping down.

1713
01:07:29,357 --> 01:07:32,127
(Gary can now tear name tags.)

1714
01:07:33,197 --> 01:07:34,257
(Hae Jin has Remove a Consonant Card.)

1715
01:07:34,257 --> 01:07:35,357
- Whom should we get rid of? - Wait a minute.

1716
01:07:35,357 --> 01:07:37,397
Who's left? Jo Yoon Hee and...

1717
01:07:37,957 --> 01:07:39,127
Lim Ji Yeon.

1718
01:07:39,297 --> 01:07:41,297
What should we go for? M?

1719
01:07:41,297 --> 01:07:43,857
Let's go with that. We don't have to do H yet.

1720
01:07:43,857 --> 01:07:45,297
Sounds good.

1721
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:50,657
(Ji Yeon finds a box at the moment of crisis.)

1722
01:07:50,657 --> 01:07:52,597
"Pick the sentence with the correct spelling."

1723
01:07:52,597 --> 01:07:54,227
Let's see.

1724
01:07:54,227 --> 01:07:55,797
(Pick the sentence with the correct spelling.)

1725
01:07:55,797 --> 01:07:57,897
I'll go with number one, "The noodles haven't swollen."

1726
01:07:57,897 --> 01:07:59,497
(Ji Yeon picks number 1.)

1727
01:07:59,497 --> 01:08:02,027
(That's correct.)

1728
01:08:02,027 --> 01:08:03,157
Nice.

1729
01:08:03,427 --> 01:08:07,457
(Should I rip Ji Yeon's name tag?)

1730
01:08:08,527 --> 01:08:09,997
- Let's go look for her. - Let's go.

1731
01:08:10,357 --> 01:08:13,597
Give me a holler if you spot her.

1732
01:08:14,357 --> 01:08:18,127
(The bell rings.)

1733
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:22,457
- Yu Hae Jin has removed M. - M?

1734
01:08:22,457 --> 01:08:26,597
(I could have removed a consonant myself.)

1735
01:08:27,327 --> 01:08:31,067
(Thank you, Hae Jin.)

1736
01:08:35,697 --> 01:08:38,997
Lim Ji Yeon has removed K.

1737
01:08:39,297 --> 01:08:41,857
(Ji Yeon's choice was K.)

1738
01:08:41,857 --> 01:08:43,797
No...

1739
01:08:45,567 --> 01:08:46,697
- She removed K. - What?

1740
01:08:48,497 --> 01:08:50,067
Lim Ji Yeon has removed K.

1741
01:08:50,067 --> 01:08:51,727
No!

1742
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:53,797
(Gary and Kwang Soo are both out.)

1743
01:08:54,067 --> 01:08:55,827
Lim Ji Yeon has removed K.

1744
01:08:55,827 --> 01:08:57,357
(Gary wails.)

1745
01:08:57,357 --> 01:09:00,067
(You didn't see this coming, did you?)

1746
01:09:00,997 --> 01:09:02,627
(I didn't even get to eliminate anyone.)

1747
01:09:02,627 --> 01:09:04,027
Gary is out.

1748
01:09:04,757 --> 01:09:06,067
Lim Ji Yeon!

1749
01:09:08,597 --> 01:09:10,297
- Kwang Soo is out. - They're out.

1750
01:09:10,657 --> 01:09:12,567
(She's very happy.)

1751
01:09:13,497 --> 01:09:16,597
(N is the only consonant left.)

1752
01:09:17,257 --> 01:09:18,457
(I have to get rid of J that's been saved by Blue Team.)

1753
01:09:18,457 --> 01:09:19,757
It's not her either.

1754
01:09:19,757 --> 01:09:22,197
(I have to get rid of J that's been saved by Blue Team.)

1755
01:09:29,257 --> 01:09:32,497
(She miraculously finds the box.)

1756
01:09:33,297 --> 01:09:35,527
(Pick the phrase that has the following meaning.)

1757
01:09:35,527 --> 01:09:36,897
Are you kidding me?

1758
01:09:37,327 --> 01:09:38,597
Let me think...

1759
01:09:38,597 --> 01:09:42,897
(She thinks hard.)

1760
01:09:42,897 --> 01:09:44,027
It's number one.

1761
01:09:44,027 --> 01:09:45,357
(She picks answer number 1.)

1762
01:09:45,357 --> 01:09:49,627
(If she gets this right, they're even with Blue Team.)

1763
01:09:50,597 --> 01:09:53,527
(That's correct.)

1764
01:09:53,997 --> 01:09:55,157
I did it.

1765
01:09:56,427 --> 01:09:57,797
Who's left?

1766
01:09:57,797 --> 01:10:01,997
There's Hae Jin, Jae Seok, Joon, Ji Yeon and you.

1767
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:03,397
(Should I remove J now?)

1768
01:10:05,757 --> 01:10:09,927
(Ji Yeon has Gary's bag and is moving towards Blue Team.)

1769
01:10:10,597 --> 01:10:12,457
- Let's go. - There's the box!

1770
01:10:13,697 --> 01:10:16,997
(Joon finds the box.)

1771
01:10:17,427 --> 01:10:20,597
- Is that it? - "Guess the correct spelling".

1772
01:10:20,597 --> 01:10:23,697
"An accident broke out eventually."

1773
01:10:23,857 --> 01:10:24,857
Isn't it number one?

1774
01:10:24,857 --> 01:10:26,597
- We pronounce it like number one. - I think it's number one.

1775
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:28,397
- It's probably a trick question. - I think so, too.

1776
01:10:28,397 --> 01:10:30,197
I think it's number two.

1777
01:10:30,197 --> 01:10:31,527
- It's number two. - "An accident..."

1778
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:33,127
- "broke out eventually". - That's right.

1779
01:10:33,127 --> 01:10:34,257
(Joon picks number 2.)

1780
01:10:34,627 --> 01:10:40,197
(Their fate depends on this answer.)

1781
01:10:41,067 --> 01:10:44,027
(Will they guess it right and win?)

1782
01:10:44,097 --> 01:10:46,457
I don't know which consonants are left.

1783
01:10:47,227 --> 01:10:50,597
(The bell rings.)

1784
01:10:50,597 --> 01:10:51,697
The only one I have left is N.

1785
01:10:51,697 --> 01:10:54,197
Lee Joon has removed N.

1786
01:10:54,297 --> 01:10:57,927
(Oh no)

1787
01:10:57,927 --> 01:11:00,497
Lee Joon has removed N.

1788
01:11:01,427 --> 01:11:06,527
(Does that mean Blue Team is out?)

1789
01:11:07,067 --> 01:11:08,427
- It's number two. - "An accident..."

1790
01:11:08,427 --> 01:11:09,997
- "broke out eventually." - That's right.

1791
01:11:09,997 --> 01:11:14,997
(Team Blue came to an agreement and guessed the answer.)

1792
01:11:15,257 --> 01:11:17,127
- I was right. - We got it right.

1793
01:11:17,397 --> 01:11:18,497
(Their choice was correct.)

1794
01:11:19,457 --> 01:11:21,227
- We choose N. - We'll remove N.

1795
01:11:22,067 --> 01:11:23,957
Goodness, I can't believe I found this.

1796
01:11:23,957 --> 01:11:25,757
Let's remove N!

1797
01:11:27,357 --> 01:11:28,927
(The final round is over.)

1798
01:11:28,927 --> 01:11:30,927
Today's winning team is...

1799
01:11:31,257 --> 01:11:32,257
Blue Team.

1800
01:11:32,257 --> 01:11:34,827
(Blue Team wins the final mission.)

1801
01:11:35,957 --> 01:11:37,457
Blue Team won.

1802
01:11:37,457 --> 01:11:39,597
We would've lost had it not been for the Save a Consonant Card.

1803
01:11:39,597 --> 01:11:41,457
- What? Oh, I see. - You mean Save a Consonant Card?

1804
01:11:41,457 --> 01:11:43,757
You received that because you won a mission before that.

1805
01:11:43,757 --> 01:11:45,197
Y, M,

1806
01:11:45,357 --> 01:11:47,397
Try to arrange them by the number.

1807
01:11:47,457 --> 01:11:49,357
M, M, Y, J, J?

1808
01:11:49,457 --> 01:11:52,097
What is this? It seems like they represent initial sounds.

1809
01:11:52,157 --> 01:11:54,127
What's this? It's open.

1810
01:11:55,397 --> 01:12:00,357
(The firmly closed box has now been opened.)

1811
01:12:00,357 --> 01:12:01,397
What's this?

1812
01:12:01,397 --> 01:12:03,027
Isn't this the Tripitaka Koreana?

1813
01:12:04,067 --> 01:12:06,157
(It looks like an old book from a museum.)

1814
01:12:06,157 --> 01:12:09,197
It may look like an ordinary, old book,

1815
01:12:09,197 --> 01:12:11,327
but this book contains...

1816
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,957
our ancestors' life threatening struggles to protect Hangeul.

1817
01:12:13,957 --> 01:12:16,227
It's called the "Malmoi Manuscript".

1818
01:12:16,227 --> 01:12:17,757
- "Malmoi Manuscript"? - Yes.

1819
01:12:17,757 --> 01:12:22,527
The five consonants you've found represent the initial sounds...

1820
01:12:22,957 --> 01:12:25,757
- of "Malmoi Operation". - What is that?

1821
01:12:27,097 --> 01:12:30,357
(What exactly was the "Malmoi Operation"?)

1822
01:12:30,357 --> 01:12:34,157
(Malmoi Operation)

1823
01:12:34,157 --> 01:12:37,757
The places where you carried out your missions were all related...

1824
01:12:37,757 --> 01:12:43,257
to the activists who tried to protect Hangeul.

1825
01:12:44,427 --> 01:12:46,027
(All the mission were related...)

1826
01:12:46,027 --> 01:12:47,657
(to Hangeul and the independence movement.)

1827
01:12:47,657 --> 01:12:50,627
- Isn't it yakgwa? - Yakgwa!

1828
01:12:51,257 --> 01:12:57,427
(What are the hidden stories of the places we've visited?)

1829
01:12:58,157 --> 01:13:01,157
They all were related to the independence movement,

1830
01:13:01,157 --> 01:13:03,657
but especially with one person.

1831
01:13:03,657 --> 01:13:04,657
Was it King Sejong the Great?

1832
01:13:04,827 --> 01:13:06,927
- It's not him. - Oh, is it not?

1833
01:13:06,927 --> 01:13:10,757
Here's a hint. King Sejong the Great invented Hunminjeongeum.

1834
01:13:10,927 --> 01:13:14,297
This person completed Hangeul and came up with that word.

1835
01:13:14,297 --> 01:13:17,327
- Do you mean Ju Si Gyeong? - You're right. It's him.

1836
01:13:17,457 --> 01:13:20,067
- He was everywhere today. - Really?

1837
01:13:20,327 --> 01:13:23,497
Let me tell you a little bit about him.

1838
01:13:23,497 --> 01:13:25,657
He had to make his own living...

1839
01:13:25,757 --> 01:13:27,997
because his family was so poor.

1840
01:13:28,097 --> 01:13:29,757
Whenever he had time,

1841
01:13:29,757 --> 01:13:31,027
since 7 or 8 years of age,

1842
01:13:31,027 --> 01:13:33,857
he made straw shoes and sold them at the market.

1843
01:13:33,857 --> 01:13:37,197
(But our language, Hangeul, was not present at that time.)

1844
01:13:37,197 --> 01:13:39,097
He thought it wasn't right.

1845
01:13:39,157 --> 01:13:43,127
The official language was Chinese, not Hangeul.

1846
01:13:43,457 --> 01:13:47,257
That's why he started to study Hangeul.

1847
01:13:47,327 --> 01:13:50,897
He taught students Hangeul in various schools.

1848
01:13:50,957 --> 01:13:54,097
He couldn't even spare time to sit down.

1849
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:56,697
So he packed a bag and went from school to school, teaching Hangeul.

1850
01:13:56,697 --> 01:13:59,157
He went around in straw shoes and overworked himself.

1851
01:13:59,157 --> 01:14:01,567
Since he pushed himself too hard,

1852
01:14:01,827 --> 01:14:06,727
he worked himself to death at the mere age of 39.

1853
01:14:07,727 --> 01:14:10,397
- We were there. - That's where we sang.

1854
01:14:10,757 --> 01:14:12,567
That's where we sang and skipped ropes.

1855
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:15,067
Ju Si Gyeong Garden used to be the place...

1856
01:14:15,227 --> 01:14:17,157
where he, himself,

1857
01:14:17,157 --> 01:14:20,697
studied Hangeul until his death.

1858
01:14:23,357 --> 01:14:26,957
I think it was a miracle that Hangeul didn't disappear.

1859
01:14:27,197 --> 01:14:29,697
Because in the 1930s,

1860
01:14:29,857 --> 01:14:33,127
Japan banned Koreans from using Hangeul in everyday lives.

1861
01:14:33,157 --> 01:14:36,327
We had to change our names. I know this is absurd,

1862
01:14:36,397 --> 01:14:38,297
but there were even posters that said,

1863
01:14:38,297 --> 01:14:40,357
"Dream in Japanese."

1864
01:14:41,627 --> 01:14:43,567
It was impossible to preserve Hangeul.

1865
01:14:44,457 --> 01:14:48,457
But Si Gyeong's disciples accomplished this miracle.

1866
01:14:48,457 --> 01:14:51,097
His disciples organised the Joseon Linguistics Committee...

1867
01:14:51,097 --> 01:14:52,797
and pleaded with the public.

1868
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:55,857
They said, "Please help us to preserve our own language."

1869
01:14:55,957 --> 01:14:59,827
"If you remember any pronunciations or words in Hangeul,"

1870
01:14:59,857 --> 01:15:02,757
"please write down and send them to Joseon Linguistics Committee."

1871
01:15:02,757 --> 01:15:05,297
("If you remember any Korean words, even swear words, please send them.)

1872
01:15:05,857 --> 01:15:07,567
The whole nation cooperated.

1873
01:15:07,567 --> 01:15:10,397
Even elementary school students from 500 schools participated.

1874
01:15:10,497 --> 01:15:14,427
The manuscript gathered from all over the country is...

1875
01:15:14,457 --> 01:15:15,597
the "Malmoi Manuscript".

1876
01:15:15,597 --> 01:15:17,157
(Their hard work was created.)

1877
01:15:17,157 --> 01:15:21,497
They gathered the manuscripts and slowly compiled a dictionary.

1878
01:15:21,567 --> 01:15:25,127
But in 1942, an unexpected misfortune happened.

1879
01:15:25,427 --> 01:15:27,727
They collected manuscripts for 13 years,

1880
01:15:28,027 --> 01:15:30,627
but the Japanese confiscated them.

1881
01:15:30,657 --> 01:15:32,857
That's how the "Malmoi Operation" came to an end.

1882
01:15:33,567 --> 01:15:36,227
But a miraculous thing happened.

1883
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:40,857
After our independence, the manuscript was discovered...

1884
01:15:41,027 --> 01:15:43,497
in a storage at Seoul Station.

1885
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:46,297
(2,600 pages of manuscript was discovered at Seoul Station.)

1886
01:15:46,297 --> 01:15:48,197
After the Korean War,

1887
01:15:48,197 --> 01:15:51,497
a total of six books were published.

1888
01:15:51,497 --> 01:15:53,067
(The first Korean dictionary was created.)

1889
01:15:53,067 --> 01:15:54,927
- We've been there. - You're right.

1890
01:15:55,067 --> 01:15:56,957
The Korean Language Society now inherited...

1891
01:15:56,957 --> 01:16:00,227
the legacy of Joseon Linguistics Committees.

1892
01:16:00,257 --> 01:16:02,657
That's where you carried out your mission.

1893
01:16:02,657 --> 01:16:04,657
(The Korean Language Society)

1894
01:16:04,657 --> 01:16:08,357
There's a book Si Gyeong wrote before the Japanese colonial era...

1895
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:12,327
because he was so upset at how people disdained Hangeul.

1896
01:16:12,327 --> 01:16:15,257
Here's a quote from the book.

1897
01:16:15,597 --> 01:16:17,227
Hae Jin, would you like to read it?

1898
01:16:17,857 --> 01:16:21,127
"If you ignore the spoken and written language, which is..."

1899
01:16:21,127 --> 01:16:23,027
"the most important aspect in protecting a country,"

1900
01:16:23,027 --> 01:16:25,197
"the foundation of the country will decay."

1901
01:16:25,927 --> 01:16:30,727
It feels as if he's speaking to us right now.

1902
01:16:30,757 --> 01:16:35,457
You must've had a hard time today with missing consonants.

1903
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:37,327
- Yes. - But imagine if it wasn't...

1904
01:16:37,327 --> 01:16:39,567
just the consonants, but the entire language that was missing.

1905
01:16:39,957 --> 01:16:42,827
It'd be more than uncomfortable. I'd be sorrowful.

1906
01:16:43,327 --> 01:16:47,297
I hope we could remember their sacrifices and contributions...

1907
01:16:47,327 --> 01:16:50,257
to preserve Hangeul...

1908
01:16:50,257 --> 01:16:52,127
at least on Hangeul Day.

1909
01:16:52,127 --> 01:16:56,397
(Please remember Ju Si Gyeong and Joseon Linguistics Committee.)

1910
01:16:56,397 --> 01:17:01,227
Since today is Hangeul Day, we should try to remember them.

1911
01:17:01,227 --> 01:17:03,357
However, I feel guilty that...

1912
01:17:03,457 --> 01:17:06,397
we often forget to appreciate them in our daily lives.
