1
00:00:03,794 --> 00:00:06,894
(On an autumn day at Paju, Gyeonggi Province)

2
00:00:09,294 --> 00:00:11,894
(Autumn is here.)

3
00:00:12,324 --> 00:00:17,324
(They have a good feeling today.)

4
00:00:17,494 --> 00:00:18,664
- Hello. - Hello.

5
00:00:18,664 --> 00:00:20,524
- Are we going on a trip? - Hello.

6
00:00:20,624 --> 00:00:22,694
It's still hot although it's fall now.

7
00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:26,924
- North Chungcheong Province. - Backpacks would've been better.

8
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,664
Why are you in the same shirt for weeks?

9
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:33,064
- This isn't the same shirt. - Do you have only one shirt?

10
00:00:33,064 --> 00:00:35,224
- Is this a different shirt? - It is!

11
00:00:35,224 --> 00:00:37,594
He told me that he has 20 black shirts.

12
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:39,464
I've never seen...

13
00:00:39,464 --> 00:00:41,594
anyone wearing the same shirt except Steve Jobs.

14
00:00:42,224 --> 00:00:43,764
I thought you'll showcase a new cell phone today.

15
00:00:44,824 --> 00:00:46,524
(They both love black shirts.)

16
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:49,394
Don't you think it's too early to wear that jacket?

17
00:00:50,124 --> 00:00:51,264
Don't talk about my fashion.

18
00:00:51,264 --> 00:00:53,594
It's such a hot autumn day.

19
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:54,964
You know I'm a fashionista.

20
00:00:54,964 --> 00:00:56,994
You're in a summer look,

21
00:00:57,594 --> 00:00:59,794
and you're in a winter look.

22
00:00:59,824 --> 00:01:02,864
- Why do all of us have a suitcase? - What's all this?

23
00:01:02,864 --> 00:01:04,994
- I thought we're going on a trip. - What is this?

24
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:05,994
It's like a uniform.

25
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:08,294
It looks like we all brought the same suitcase to not lose anyone.

26
00:01:08,294 --> 00:01:11,194
We distributed suitcases to you because you'll go on a trip today.

27
00:01:11,194 --> 00:01:12,534
Did you pack your bags?

28
00:01:12,534 --> 00:01:13,624
We did.

29
00:01:13,624 --> 00:01:17,194
I'm sorry, but will we really stay here?

30
00:01:19,064 --> 00:01:21,564
(The place looks very empty.)

31
00:01:21,694 --> 00:01:24,194
(Will they really stay here?)

32
00:01:24,364 --> 00:01:26,294
I can't believe we'll stay here today.

33
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,594
No one would ever want to stay in a container.

34
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:30,724
For our special trip,

35
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:33,994
we invited special guests here.

36
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:36,164
(We'll introduce our guests to you.)

37
00:01:36,224 --> 00:01:37,794
- There they are. - Really?

38
00:01:37,794 --> 00:01:39,424
(They're coming.)

39
00:01:41,464 --> 00:01:44,194
- That's Na Rae. - Se Chan and Na Rae are here.

40
00:01:44,494 --> 00:01:45,824
Hi, Sol Bin.

41
00:01:45,824 --> 00:01:48,164
(We're here to make your trip extraordinary!)

42
00:01:48,564 --> 00:01:50,964
- Look at Na Rae. - She dressed up too much.

43
00:01:50,964 --> 00:01:52,364
Isn't it a little excessive?

44
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:55,494
By the way, she and Soo Hong look good together.

45
00:01:55,624 --> 00:01:56,864
Are they a couple?

46
00:01:56,924 --> 00:02:00,594
It feels like they don't want to be with me.

47
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:02,594
- Hello. - Introduce them to us.

48
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:03,724
- Hello. - It is...

49
00:02:03,764 --> 00:02:06,294
- She's Sol Bin. - It's like a movie from the 70s.

50
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:08,664
- Welcome! - Hello, Sol Bin.

51
00:02:08,664 --> 00:02:11,024
- Hello. - It's good to see you.

52
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:16,964
His mother now allowed him to go clubbing.

53
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:19,494
- Right. - There's no one who saw...

54
00:02:19,494 --> 00:02:23,994
her son go clubbing on television except your mother.

55
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:25,824
- Your mother is the first one. - She is.

56
00:02:27,494 --> 00:02:30,824
(Soo Hong went clubbing in a television programme.)

57
00:02:30,824 --> 00:02:32,094
My goodness.

58
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:36,564
I never mentioned about clubbing before, but Jae Seok brought it up.

59
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:38,664
- He blamed me a lot. - Of course.

60
00:02:38,664 --> 00:02:40,494
Since I was young back then,

61
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,934
I was worried I couldn't get married because of what you said.

62
00:02:42,434 --> 00:02:43,994
I resented you a lot.

63
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:46,194
Soo Hong, you were 44 at that time.

64
00:02:46,194 --> 00:02:47,364
(You weren't young.)

65
00:02:47,464 --> 00:02:49,794
- My goodness. - You can't say you were young.

66
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,024
(He was a young guy at the age of 44.)

67
00:02:51,024 --> 00:02:53,124
You weren't young because you were 44.

68
00:02:53,224 --> 00:02:56,864
He called me and told me he's in trouble.

69
00:02:56,864 --> 00:02:59,664
He even said he was scolded by his nephews.

70
00:02:59,664 --> 00:03:01,464
He blamed me a lot,

71
00:03:01,464 --> 00:03:03,664
but now he's in the spotlight because of that club episode.

72
00:03:03,664 --> 00:03:05,424
- My nephews are proud of me now. - Right.

73
00:03:05,624 --> 00:03:07,764
His nephews told him during the holidays that they're proud of him.

74
00:03:07,764 --> 00:03:10,324
- So Seok Jin goes clubbing, too. - He's right.

75
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:13,324
- That's a problem. - You can't go clubbing, Seok Jin.

76
00:03:13,324 --> 00:03:15,594
- He called me and asked, - Please take me clubbing.

77
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:16,764
"Do clubs open on Sundays, too?"

78
00:03:17,794 --> 00:03:19,124
- He really asked me. - Goodness.

79
00:03:19,764 --> 00:03:21,664
- Gosh. - That's a problem.

80
00:03:21,664 --> 00:03:24,264
- Hello, Na Rae. - Hello.

81
00:03:24,264 --> 00:03:25,364
Gosh, Na Rae...

82
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:26,624
(Shy)

83
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:29,594
- Why do you put your hand there? - Please lower your hand.

84
00:03:29,594 --> 00:03:31,794
What's wrong with you?

85
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,064
- Gosh. - I'm sorry.

86
00:03:33,064 --> 00:03:34,924
- She's trying to look sexy. - No way.

87
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:36,824
Please wipe the lipstick off your teeth.

88
00:03:36,824 --> 00:03:38,594
(You got lipstick on your teeth.)

89
00:03:38,724 --> 00:03:40,494
- You shouldn't say that. - What is this?

90
00:03:40,964 --> 00:03:42,364
- But... - You can wipe her teeth for her.

91
00:03:42,364 --> 00:03:44,464
How can I wipe it with my fingers?

92
00:03:44,794 --> 00:03:46,394
- I can't do that. - Why didn't you tell me earlier?

93
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,824
And we have Lee Kyu Han with us.

94
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,524
(A rising entertainer, Lee Kyu Han)

95
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:52,694
Kyu Han.

96
00:03:53,394 --> 00:03:55,664
It's nice to see you here, Kyu Han.

97
00:03:55,664 --> 00:03:57,624
But I never expected you here, though.

98
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:01,864
He's stuck between these comedians.

99
00:04:01,864 --> 00:04:04,394
He's a rising entertainer.

100
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:06,024
- He appeared in "Knowing Bros". - "Knowing Bros"...

101
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:07,824
- Right, he did. - I saw it, too.

102
00:04:07,824 --> 00:04:09,324
- He was funny there. - I saw him...

103
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:10,894
- He did a lot of funny things. - Kyu Han.

104
00:04:10,894 --> 00:04:12,594
You don't have to try too hard to explain...

105
00:04:12,594 --> 00:04:14,524
because I also have no idea why I'm here.

106
00:04:15,894 --> 00:04:18,564
When I first saw Na Rae and Soo Hong,

107
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:20,324
I thought you were wearing blue screens.

108
00:04:21,124 --> 00:04:22,864
(People in special effects)

109
00:04:22,864 --> 00:04:24,694
They can change our clothes using special effects.

110
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:27,394
You've become a good entertainer.

111
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:29,424
How have you been doing, Kyu Han?

112
00:04:29,464 --> 00:04:30,824
I prepared a lot...

113
00:04:30,824 --> 00:04:33,594
- because it's a popular show. - Right.

114
00:04:34,164 --> 00:04:35,164
I'll do my best...

115
00:04:35,164 --> 00:04:36,524
Gosh, there's a wasp.

116
00:04:37,264 --> 00:04:39,324
(She's making a fuss.)

117
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:40,794
- So this... - Gosh.

118
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:42,094
People have a misconception about wasps.

119
00:04:42,094 --> 00:04:44,294
People stay still when they see wasps near them,

120
00:04:44,294 --> 00:04:46,494
but an expert said we must not stay still.

121
00:04:47,594 --> 00:04:49,064
- Really? - No way!

122
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:50,564
- That's dangerous. - You shouldn't stay still.

123
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:52,124
- It's good only for wasps. - He's so hilarious.

124
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:54,294
If we stay still, we'll give enough time...

125
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,924
- for wasps to sting us. - That's right.

126
00:04:55,924 --> 00:04:58,764
I heard that we must not wear sweaters.

127
00:04:58,764 --> 00:05:00,464
- Why not? - Wasps get stuck in the sweater...

128
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:02,734
- There's an insect... - and think we're attacking them.

129
00:05:03,624 --> 00:05:04,764
Hold on.

130
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:08,864
What on earth are you doing?

131
00:05:08,864 --> 00:05:10,464
- Are you out of your mind? - You can't do that!

132
00:05:10,594 --> 00:05:12,994
- Jae Seok! Are you crazy? - What are you trying to do?

133
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:14,964
- But there was an insect... - You can't do that!

134
00:05:14,964 --> 00:05:16,864
- There was an insect on her... - I'll do it for you.

135
00:05:16,864 --> 00:05:18,194
My goodness.

136
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:19,794
- Let it go. - Good.

137
00:05:20,164 --> 00:05:21,794
- Gosh. - Now I'm relieved.

138
00:05:21,924 --> 00:05:23,564
Se Chan is here with us!

139
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,734
Hello.

140
00:05:25,964 --> 00:05:28,794
Se Chan is Se Hyung's younger brother.

141
00:05:29,064 --> 00:05:31,024
- Are you two really brothers? - Yes, we are.

142
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:33,994
Se Hyung and Se Chan have the same parents.

143
00:05:34,164 --> 00:05:36,064
How is Se Hyung like at home?

144
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:37,664
Does he really behave like an older brother?

145
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:41,324
When people ask me who I respect and admire the most,

146
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:42,824
- I always say it's Se Hyung. - Why?

147
00:05:42,824 --> 00:05:45,294
He's very honest and polite.

148
00:05:47,364 --> 00:05:49,224
(What about that incident?)

149
00:05:50,124 --> 00:05:51,564
He's very honest and polite.

150
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:53,494
The way he thinks...

151
00:05:53,494 --> 00:05:55,524
But isn't he a troublemaker?

152
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:57,094
I won't make any excuses about that.

153
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,694
(He admits right away.)

154
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,724
A troublemaker...

155
00:06:01,924 --> 00:06:04,294
- It wasn't like a big crime. - I'm good friends with them.

156
00:06:05,094 --> 00:06:06,894
Let's not insult each other's family.

157
00:06:07,494 --> 00:06:08,924
- Se Chan. - Yes?

158
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:10,094
That's all for your interview.

159
00:06:10,094 --> 00:06:11,824
(His interview ends abruptly.)

160
00:06:11,824 --> 00:06:15,064
- About my brother... - Se Chan is closed to tears.

161
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:18,624
Both Se Chan and Se Hyung are really busy these days.

162
00:06:18,624 --> 00:06:20,094
Se Chan barely managed to spare his time for us.

163
00:06:20,094 --> 00:06:21,764
- I'm glad you're here. - Thank you.

164
00:06:21,764 --> 00:06:23,394
You're all sweaty.

165
00:06:23,394 --> 00:06:24,894
Seriously,

166
00:06:24,894 --> 00:06:26,164
I feel really hot here.

167
00:06:26,994 --> 00:06:28,294
I think your skirt will melt.

168
00:06:28,294 --> 00:06:30,524
That's why I told you not to wear that.

169
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,564
Seok Jin finally took his leather jacket off.

170
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:34,464
- It's really hot. - Isn't it?

171
00:06:34,464 --> 00:06:36,194
- I'm going crazy. - It really drives me crazy.

172
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:38,594
- I feel like I'm on fire. - He finally took his jacket off.

173
00:06:39,594 --> 00:06:42,394
Actually, I thought his jacket looks like a wrapper.

174
00:06:44,124 --> 00:06:48,064
Seok Jin wants to know about this lady.

175
00:06:48,224 --> 00:06:49,364
It's Sol Bin!

176
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:50,624
(A rising star, Sol Bin)

177
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:52,724
- A rising star. - I have a crush on you.

178
00:06:52,724 --> 00:06:53,794
I have a crush on you.

179
00:06:53,794 --> 00:06:55,824
Hello, I'm Sol Bin of Laboum.

180
00:06:57,194 --> 00:06:58,524
(All guys can't help but smiling.)

181
00:06:58,524 --> 00:07:00,294
- She's so pretty. - Well,

182
00:07:00,624 --> 00:07:04,364
I have a crush on her, too. Who else will have a crush on her?

183
00:07:04,364 --> 00:07:05,794
Kwang Soo already has a crush on her.

184
00:07:05,794 --> 00:07:07,494
- Again? - Kwang Soo.

185
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:09,324
Look at him smiling.

186
00:07:09,624 --> 00:07:11,924
He loves ladies who have "Bin" in their names.

187
00:07:11,924 --> 00:07:13,994
You like Sun Bin and Soo Bin as well.

188
00:07:15,494 --> 00:07:17,894
I think he's nickname should be Playboy.

189
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:19,364
What are you talking about?

190
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:22,224
- That's too much. - How can you ever say that to me?

191
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:24,924
All right. So we're on a trip today,

192
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:26,864
but I have no idea where we'll stay.

193
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,524
Before we start,

194
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:31,594
we have a box which has balls in four different colours.

195
00:07:32,124 --> 00:07:35,094
We'll divide you into 4 teams with 3 members each.

196
00:07:35,894 --> 00:07:37,594
- Gosh. - We don't know who'll be with us.

197
00:07:37,594 --> 00:07:40,124
- Pick a ball first, Kwang Soo. - Okay.

198
00:07:40,664 --> 00:07:41,964
There goes Playboy.

199
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,924
There's only one person I want to be with.

200
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:46,124
I have a green ball.

201
00:07:46,124 --> 00:07:47,664
(Kwang Soo is in Green Team.)

202
00:07:48,024 --> 00:07:49,294
I wonder what team I will be in.

203
00:07:49,294 --> 00:07:50,464
Please!

204
00:07:51,524 --> 00:07:53,594
It will be funny if you pick a green one.

205
00:07:53,594 --> 00:07:54,624
- Right. - Yes.

206
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:56,024
My goodness.

207
00:07:56,024 --> 00:07:57,724
(Jong Kook is in Orange Team.)

208
00:07:57,924 --> 00:07:59,594
This is Soo Hong's turn.

209
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:02,724
- You... - You can't do that!

210
00:08:02,724 --> 00:08:04,964
(He puts the ball back into the box.)

211
00:08:04,964 --> 00:08:06,494
(Everyone complains.)

212
00:08:06,494 --> 00:08:09,094
- You can't do that. - It's because of my sunglasses.

213
00:08:09,094 --> 00:08:10,594
Just pick one quickly.

214
00:08:10,594 --> 00:08:11,994
If you do that again, I'll cut your wrist.

215
00:08:11,994 --> 00:08:13,264
(He picks a ball.)

216
00:08:13,264 --> 00:08:15,264
(Soo Hong is in Red Team.)

217
00:08:15,264 --> 00:08:16,464
It's Na Rae's turn now.

218
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:19,124
Who do you want to be with?

219
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,764
I want to be in the same team with Jae Seok.

220
00:08:21,764 --> 00:08:24,394
A shaman told me you'll bring me luck.

221
00:08:25,294 --> 00:08:27,424
- I mean it. - I wish I could meet that shaman.

222
00:08:28,824 --> 00:08:30,064
(Na Rae takes out an orange ball.)

223
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:32,164
- It's Jong Kook's team. - We don't know if it's good yet.

224
00:08:32,164 --> 00:08:33,164
- Okay. - You rule in your team.

225
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:35,094
It's Kyu Han's turn.

226
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:38,364
It's a blue ball.

227
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:41,224
- Why is there a blue ball? - Are there four teams?

228
00:08:41,224 --> 00:08:43,464
- Now, Se Chan. - I don't...

229
00:08:43,464 --> 00:08:46,024
- want to be in Na Rae's team. - It's okay.

230
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:48,624
- What a relief. - It's green.

231
00:08:48,664 --> 00:08:50,334
- They are lucky. - Nice.

232
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:53,064
- Now, it's Sol Bin's turn. - Today...

233
00:08:53,464 --> 00:08:55,124
- Ji Hyo, pick red. - Today's highlight.

234
00:08:55,124 --> 00:08:56,294
(He's anticipating.)

235
00:08:56,424 --> 00:08:58,564
Let Sol Bin pick last.

236
00:08:58,724 --> 00:09:00,334
- That's not fair. - Why?

237
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:02,624
- The chances will decrease. - It's okay.

238
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:04,924
- This is not good. - What is it? Green.

239
00:09:08,624 --> 00:09:11,524
(Seok Jin is in Green Team.)

240
00:09:14,524 --> 00:09:16,064
Green Team is doomed.

241
00:09:16,794 --> 00:09:18,524
I can't believe it.

242
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,364
(If I could turn the clock back.)

243
00:09:20,364 --> 00:09:22,164
Green Team is done. They have all three.

244
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:25,664
How come I should be with Kwang Soo and Seok Jin?

245
00:09:25,724 --> 00:09:27,724
(He's so frustrated about his team members.)

246
00:09:27,724 --> 00:09:30,124
- One team is ready now. - Okay.

247
00:09:30,124 --> 00:09:31,464
One team is complete.

248
00:09:31,464 --> 00:09:32,524
(Green Team is organised like this.)

249
00:09:32,524 --> 00:09:34,564
Why don't they pick together?

250
00:09:34,564 --> 00:09:35,594
Now, Ji Hyo.

251
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:38,964
- Sol Bin and Ji Hyo. - I guess it'll be blue.

252
00:09:40,364 --> 00:09:41,394
Pick blue.

253
00:09:42,224 --> 00:09:43,424
- Good. - Great.

254
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:44,424
(Ji Hyo joins Orange Team.)

255
00:09:44,424 --> 00:09:45,624
Let's go.

256
00:09:45,624 --> 00:09:48,164
Jong Kook has been teamed up with girls these days.

257
00:09:48,224 --> 00:09:50,894
- Gosh. - How lucky you are.

258
00:09:51,064 --> 00:09:52,264
- You're lucky to be with girls. - What did you say?

259
00:09:52,264 --> 00:09:54,834
- It's true. - You're lucky.

260
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:56,564
Is this something you should be upset about?

261
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:59,194
It is true that you're lucky to have us.

262
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:01,924
- They're all wearing hats. - They go well with each other.

263
00:10:01,924 --> 00:10:04,334
- The team in hats look good. - Right.

264
00:10:04,464 --> 00:10:05,864
I'm getting nervous.

265
00:10:05,894 --> 00:10:07,024
You should have let her choose sooner.

266
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:10,424
- There is no big difference. - Right.

267
00:10:10,894 --> 00:10:12,124
Go. Let's go.

268
00:10:13,024 --> 00:10:15,194
Go. Pick blue.

269
00:10:17,464 --> 00:10:20,094
(You should be with us.)

270
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,894
- Pick blue. - It's red.

271
00:10:25,894 --> 00:10:27,524
(Sol Bin becomes a Red Team member.)

272
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:30,294
(The middle-aged clubber is thrilled.)

273
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:32,364
- I'm so lucky. - He is.

274
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:34,194
(Haha put Sol Bin's ball back in so that she can choose last.)

275
00:10:34,194 --> 00:10:37,164
- Wait. He put the ball back in. - She should pick last.

276
00:10:37,164 --> 00:10:38,194
Oh, that's right.

277
00:10:39,394 --> 00:10:41,834
(Soo Hong shoots a red ball to Haha.)

278
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:44,394
Please calm down.

279
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:46,334
(He's angry at Haha.)

280
00:10:46,334 --> 00:10:49,094
- Though it's a show, I can't... - Get back.

281
00:10:49,094 --> 00:10:50,334
(The man is infuriated.)

282
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:53,224
- This is not fair. - Calm down.

283
00:10:53,224 --> 00:10:55,594
She was supposed to pick last.

284
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:57,324
- This is so funny. - Please...

285
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,924
- Soo Hong is disappointed. - It's Gary, now.

286
00:10:58,924 --> 00:10:59,924
(Gary goes first.)

287
00:11:01,464 --> 00:11:03,264
- Ta-da. - Soo Hong's team.

288
00:11:03,264 --> 00:11:04,624
(Gary is a Red Team member.)

289
00:11:05,864 --> 00:11:07,694
You'll make me unlucky.

290
00:11:07,894 --> 00:11:09,464
How could you say that?

291
00:11:11,364 --> 00:11:13,724
- I'm sorry. - Just wait and see.

292
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:15,364
- You'll be glad to have me. - Sorry.

293
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:18,724
Kyu Han is secretly smiling.

294
00:11:18,724 --> 00:11:19,724
(Kyu Hand is secretly smiling.)

295
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:22,824
- Let's wait and see. It's not over. - This is ridiculous.

296
00:11:23,424 --> 00:11:25,264
This is thrilling.

297
00:11:26,694 --> 00:11:28,464
- Haha's turn. - Let's make a great team.

298
00:11:28,794 --> 00:11:29,794
He picked one.

299
00:11:30,264 --> 00:11:31,264
Gosh.

300
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:32,464
(Haha joins Blue Team.)

301
00:11:32,464 --> 00:11:33,724
(Red Team is so happy.)

302
00:11:33,724 --> 00:11:34,994
(But he is disappointed.)

303
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,464
- The chances are 50-50. - It is.

304
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:39,194
- I can't be in her team, right? - You can't.

305
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:40,524
Why did you wait until the last moment?

306
00:11:40,524 --> 00:11:43,624
- Gosh. - Jae Seok can't team up with her.

307
00:11:43,624 --> 00:11:44,924
- Please. - Let's pay attention.

308
00:11:44,924 --> 00:11:46,794
- Sol Bin, go ahead. - Please.

309
00:11:46,794 --> 00:11:50,024
One team will have Sol Bin and the other will have me.

310
00:11:50,024 --> 00:11:51,164
- I picked one. - She did.

311
00:11:51,164 --> 00:11:53,724
- Blue Team versus... - Red Team.

312
00:11:53,724 --> 00:11:57,324
One will have me and the other will have Sol Bin.

313
00:11:58,324 --> 00:12:00,794
- Please. - Please.

314
00:12:00,794 --> 00:12:01,824
One...

315
00:12:01,824 --> 00:12:02,994
(It's either Jae Seok or Sol Bin.)

316
00:12:02,994 --> 00:12:04,194
- Two... - Pick red.

317
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:08,324
(Please)

318
00:12:10,324 --> 00:12:11,324
Three.

319
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:13,324
(Sol Bin is in Blue Team and Jae Seok is in Red Team.)

320
00:12:13,864 --> 00:12:14,894
Three.

321
00:12:15,324 --> 00:12:17,824
(They experience contrary feelings.)

322
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:19,624
- Goodness. - That was close.

323
00:12:20,224 --> 00:12:22,424
Oh my gosh.

324
00:12:22,424 --> 00:12:24,264
We win.

325
00:12:24,424 --> 00:12:26,294
- Oh my. - We made it.

326
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:28,124
- He made it. - So we set the teams.

327
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:29,524
- They're so lucky. - Right.

328
00:12:29,524 --> 00:12:31,364
- Kyu Han looks so happy. - Kyu Han does.

329
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:33,464
- He said he didn't want to come, - I know.

330
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:35,664
- but now, he's so smiley. - What a lucky team.

331
00:12:35,664 --> 00:12:37,964
I bet time will fly today.

332
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,924
- Gosh. - He's funny.

333
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:42,224
- Why am I teamed up with him? - I don't know why.

334
00:12:42,224 --> 00:12:44,564
They are unluckier than you.

335
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:45,694
(They're worse than you.)

336
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,364
- I feel miserable. - I feel bad for them.

337
00:12:47,364 --> 00:12:48,724
I have Seok Jin and Kwang Soo.

338
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:52,024
- It's the worst combination. - That's too harsh.

339
00:12:52,024 --> 00:12:53,294
How could you say that?

340
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:55,764
- Just admit it. It's true. - It's not that bad.

341
00:12:56,294 --> 00:12:57,894
Please take care of me.

342
00:12:57,894 --> 00:13:01,664
Now that you're all teamed up, you'll be now on a trip.

343
00:13:02,194 --> 00:13:03,694
The place for your trip is...

344
00:13:04,264 --> 00:13:06,164
a house that you don't want to get out of...

345
00:13:06,164 --> 00:13:08,064
because it's full of fun.

346
00:13:08,124 --> 00:13:10,864
Have a nice day playing various games.

347
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:15,194
You have to purchase all food, your necessities...

348
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:19,064
and lands with R money in the house.

349
00:13:19,194 --> 00:13:20,864
- Do we have to purchase lands? - Yes.

350
00:13:21,324 --> 00:13:24,124
You can get R money in the pawnshop.

351
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:28,324
It can be exchanged with the outfit and possessions you have.

352
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:30,724
The team that goes bankrupt after losing all R money and the lands...

353
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:32,724
is eliminated automatically and has to get penalty.

354
00:13:33,064 --> 00:13:34,524
- Do we have to purchase things? - Yes.

355
00:13:34,524 --> 00:13:36,794
The more R money and the more lands you have, the better it is.

356
00:13:36,794 --> 00:13:38,894
So utilise the two assets to win the race.

357
00:13:38,894 --> 00:13:40,724
- Do we have exceptions? - No.

358
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:43,494
We can exchange our outfits and possessions with R money?

359
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,124
You mean I have to take off my clothes?

360
00:13:46,164 --> 00:13:48,294
(Breaking news. Na Rae didn't mind taking off her clothes for R money.)

361
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,824
Na Rae, what are you trying to get at?

362
00:13:50,524 --> 00:13:52,394
How far can I go?

363
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:54,824
(Until you don't violate censorship)

364
00:13:54,824 --> 00:13:58,164
I'll show you the pawnshop where you can exchange R money.

365
00:13:58,224 --> 00:14:03,264
(What will the pawnshop for R money look like?)

366
00:14:05,124 --> 00:14:07,024
(The Man's Pawnshop?)

367
00:14:08,194 --> 00:14:11,794
(Is that the scary pawnshop from the movie?)

368
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,094
(Then is the owner...)

369
00:14:15,094 --> 00:14:16,694
(He expects another Bin.)

370
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,724
- It's Gwang Rok. - Gwang Rok.

371
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:22,424
(It's not Won Bin but Gwang Rok.)

372
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:25,424
He's Gwang Rok from "People Looking for Laughter".

373
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:26,994
His famous line is "Just do it."

374
00:14:26,994 --> 00:14:27,994
- "Sure. Sure. Just do it." - "Just do it."

375
00:14:28,524 --> 00:14:31,194
- "Just do it." - "Just do it."

376
00:14:31,194 --> 00:14:33,564
- That sketch is funny. - If you look in the front,

377
00:14:33,924 --> 00:14:34,994
there will be a table for price.

378
00:14:34,994 --> 00:14:36,564
- 50 R for the tops. - Cell phones?

379
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:38,794
- If I check my top, do I get 50 R? - The tops?

380
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:39,924
The clothes we're wearing?

381
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:41,524
- The clothes we're in? - I think that's right.

382
00:14:41,524 --> 00:14:43,324
- You mean these? - What should we wear, then?

383
00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:44,694
And do we turn in our own shoes?

384
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:45,824
- Even the shoes? - Yes.

385
00:14:45,824 --> 00:14:46,994
- Then we'll be barefoot. - Without shoes?

386
00:14:46,994 --> 00:14:50,294
- R money must be very important. - Girls will be uncomfortable.

387
00:14:52,624 --> 00:14:55,224
I think I need to exchange both the top and the bottom.

388
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,664
- A top is worth... - 50 R.

389
00:14:58,894 --> 00:15:01,664
- Here is 50 R. - I'll give you my bottom, too.

390
00:15:01,824 --> 00:15:03,794
- You take bottoms, too, right? - Yes, they are 50 R.

391
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:05,664
(They got all dressed up without knowing this.)

392
00:15:05,724 --> 00:15:06,864
I need to change my trousers.

393
00:15:07,524 --> 00:15:11,064
Giving you my shoes means that I gave up on my height.

394
00:15:11,164 --> 00:15:13,094
- Please give me 10 R more. - Let me take a look.

395
00:15:13,094 --> 00:15:14,124
Don't they look new?

396
00:15:14,724 --> 00:15:16,164
(Just go.)

397
00:15:17,064 --> 00:15:18,564
(There is no deal because of the odour.)

398
00:15:18,564 --> 00:15:19,724
- No. - Please.

399
00:15:21,324 --> 00:15:23,194
I almost took five R back from you.

400
00:15:24,294 --> 00:15:25,324
I'm not kidding.

401
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,624
Sir, these are very new.

402
00:15:28,324 --> 00:15:29,724
The insoles are separate.

403
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:32,124
- These are related to pride. - Put them down first.

404
00:15:32,124 --> 00:15:34,024
- This... - Go ahead.

405
00:15:34,024 --> 00:15:36,224
- Is it a matching ring? - Yes, here you go.

406
00:15:36,224 --> 00:15:38,124
- It fits your finger perfectly. - Please give her five R for it.

407
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:40,294
- Please give me a lot. - Here you go.

408
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,224
Could you give me that, too?

409
00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:44,024
- Give her one more. - Here.

410
00:15:44,024 --> 00:15:45,194
- This is it. - Thank you.

411
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,194
Thank you.

412
00:15:46,194 --> 00:15:47,224
Here is my bottom.

413
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:51,324
- Is it your underwear? - No, they're short trousers.

414
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:53,264
- Did you wear it or not? - Gwang Rok.

415
00:15:53,724 --> 00:15:55,394
I've worn them just once.

416
00:15:55,624 --> 00:15:56,894
Just accept them.

417
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:59,464
- Here they are. - These are trousers.

418
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:02,324
This is good wine and this is an autographed ball.

419
00:16:02,564 --> 00:16:03,724
These are first-aid medicine.

420
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:06,224
- You keep the medicine. - These are beauty products.

421
00:16:06,724 --> 00:16:08,364
- This shop is crowded. - 230 R, please.

422
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:09,394
Give some more.

423
00:16:09,564 --> 00:16:12,724
Don't force him. I wouldn't want to give you R money, either.

424
00:16:12,724 --> 00:16:14,624
- Give me 10 R more, please. - Did you say 10 R?

425
00:16:14,924 --> 00:16:16,564
- What? - You said...

426
00:16:16,694 --> 00:16:18,264
- 10 R? - What did you say?

427
00:16:18,324 --> 00:16:20,524
- You sound like you're swearing. - 20 R...

428
00:16:20,524 --> 00:16:22,724
- 20 R? - I didn't swear.

429
00:16:22,724 --> 00:16:24,724
How could you be so rude?

430
00:16:24,724 --> 00:16:27,124
- I didn't... - Apologise to us.

431
00:16:27,124 --> 00:16:29,164
- Apologise immediately. - I'm sorry.

432
00:16:29,164 --> 00:16:31,324
- 20 R... - What? Did you swear again?

433
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,424
- I mean 20 R money. - You did.

434
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:35,724
This guy has no manners.

435
00:16:35,724 --> 00:16:37,164
(We'll fix that problem next time.)

436
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:39,924
(R money each team acquired)

437
00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:44,524
You have R money now, but there is something more important than that.

438
00:16:44,524 --> 00:16:46,624
Who conquers the lands first matters...

439
00:16:46,624 --> 00:16:47,824
- the most. - That's the most important.

440
00:16:47,824 --> 00:16:48,864
It matters the most.

441
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:52,464
- We should try our best here. - Okay.

442
00:16:52,464 --> 00:16:54,124
(The right to conquer the lands first gives you a huge advantage.)

443
00:16:54,124 --> 00:16:56,424
No matter how much R money you have,

444
00:16:56,424 --> 00:16:58,464
if other teams buy all the lands before you, you'll be in trouble.

445
00:16:58,464 --> 00:16:59,524
I know.

446
00:16:59,724 --> 00:17:01,064
In order to decide...

447
00:17:01,324 --> 00:17:04,294
who buys the lands first, you'll have to...

448
00:17:04,464 --> 00:17:05,994
have one-legged fights.

449
00:17:05,994 --> 00:17:07,294
- Okay. - Okay.

450
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:09,164
(Let's buy the advantageous spot.)

451
00:17:09,164 --> 00:17:10,324
- Let's go. - We can do it.

452
00:17:10,324 --> 00:17:13,264
Choose the leader of each team and let me know.

453
00:17:13,264 --> 00:17:14,534
(Choose the leader of each team to have a fight.)

454
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,364
I won't cut slacks even to girls. Even if it's Sol Bin.

455
00:17:17,364 --> 00:17:19,164
Don't worry. He's just bluffing.

456
00:17:19,224 --> 00:17:20,794
It feels like real Running Man now.

457
00:17:21,294 --> 00:17:22,924
- Kwang Soo, write it down. - Okay, let's go.

458
00:17:22,924 --> 00:17:24,794
I will tear all your pants today.

459
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,064
- Why would you tear pants? - You'd better be careful.

460
00:17:27,064 --> 00:17:28,994
- Why would you tear pants? - Why would you?

461
00:17:28,994 --> 00:17:30,564
I'll not give you a break.

462
00:17:30,564 --> 00:17:32,694
- Age doesn't matter. - We'll be merciless...

463
00:17:32,694 --> 00:17:33,964
even to Sol Bin.

464
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:36,794
(The players who will have a one-legged fight are...)

465
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:38,794
(Jong Kook, Soo Hong, Kyu Han and Se Chan.)

466
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:42,364
(The fight to conquer the lands first has started.)

467
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:44,624
(The king of a one-legged fight, Kim Jong Kook)

468
00:17:44,624 --> 00:17:46,324
We should attack Jong Kook together.

469
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:47,664
(Park Soo Hong with strong legs due to dancing)

470
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:50,364
(A smart player, Lee Kyu Han)

471
00:17:50,364 --> 00:17:52,534
(Yang Se Chan who is so eager to win)

472
00:17:53,564 --> 00:17:56,224
(To get the right to purchase the lands first)

473
00:17:57,064 --> 00:18:01,094
(The winner can occupy the crucial zones including the bathroom.)

474
00:18:02,594 --> 00:18:03,594
One player from each team.

475
00:18:03,794 --> 00:18:06,364
We should attack Jong Kook together. Otherwise, we don't have a chance.

476
00:18:06,364 --> 00:18:07,394
That's right.

477
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:08,894
(The first target is Jong Kook.)

478
00:18:10,224 --> 00:18:13,164
(Guys, let's make an alliance. Okay?)

479
00:18:13,164 --> 00:18:15,064
(Okay. We stand a chance if it is 3 against 1.)

480
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,424
(His leg is already shaking.)

481
00:18:19,534 --> 00:18:21,194
- Together. - That's right.

482
00:18:21,264 --> 00:18:23,494
My left leg really hurts so bad.

483
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,034
(Already?)

484
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:27,594
We can't afford to lose, Se Chan.

485
00:18:27,594 --> 00:18:29,494
- We can't even go to the toilet! - My knees are weak.

486
00:18:29,494 --> 00:18:31,464
- Hang in there. - My knees hurt.

487
00:18:33,924 --> 00:18:34,964
(He falls over.)

488
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:36,324
What was that?

489
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:37,964
(I'm sorry, everyone.)

490
00:18:37,964 --> 00:18:38,994
- What are you doing? - What was that?

491
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:41,164
- Are you kidding me? - What was that?

492
00:18:41,164 --> 00:18:43,424
That was fast.

493
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:44,694
What was that?

494
00:18:44,694 --> 00:18:46,824
- You said you could do this. - Hold on.

495
00:18:47,164 --> 00:18:49,294
One, two.

496
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:52,564
Kyu Han's been working out.

497
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,724
He's got stamina.

498
00:18:54,724 --> 00:18:56,264
- Let's work together. - We should have done better.

499
00:18:56,264 --> 00:18:58,694
- This is great. - Let's get the tiger.

500
00:18:58,694 --> 00:18:59,864
Let's do this.

501
00:18:59,864 --> 00:19:01,964
- On the count of three. - Let's go.

502
00:19:01,964 --> 00:19:03,894
(Jong Kook, are you ready?)

503
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,664
- Come over here. - Let's go!

504
00:19:06,664 --> 00:19:08,534
(Soo Hong distracts Jong Kook.)

505
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:09,964
Here I go!

506
00:19:09,964 --> 00:19:11,324
(Kyu Han charges forward.)

507
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:15,124
(Can you please get rid of that monster?)

508
00:19:15,464 --> 00:19:16,764
Here I go!

509
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:17,794
Here I come!

510
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:22,324
- What are you doing? - Why are you going for him?

511
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:25,324
(Why are you attacking me?)

512
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,294
Here I go!

513
00:19:27,294 --> 00:19:28,664
Where are you going?

514
00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:30,494
- What are you doing? - What was that?

515
00:19:30,494 --> 00:19:31,964
You're supposed to be working together.

516
00:19:32,124 --> 00:19:33,964
We came in third.

517
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:35,394
I'm in second place, right?

518
00:19:35,394 --> 00:19:37,594
(Orange Team takes 1st place, Red Team 2nd and Blue Team 3rd.)

519
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,624
- Are you stupid or something? - Second place isn't that bad.

520
00:19:39,624 --> 00:19:40,894
- Are you stupid? - What is this?

521
00:19:40,894 --> 00:19:42,264
(What have you done?)

522
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,694
What is this?

523
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,124
(I don't know why I did that.)

524
00:19:46,994 --> 00:19:49,194
You will now occupy the land of your choice.

525
00:19:49,194 --> 00:19:50,964
Let's go buy some land.

526
00:19:50,964 --> 00:19:52,534
Good work, everyone.

527
00:19:52,534 --> 00:19:54,264
Basically, we need...

528
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:55,924
an area where we can cook.

529
00:19:56,124 --> 00:19:58,424
- This area costs 30 R. - We have to get this one.

530
00:19:58,494 --> 00:19:59,624
Let's get these two.

531
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:01,694
- These two? - Okay.

532
00:20:01,694 --> 00:20:03,324
We need a way out.

533
00:20:03,324 --> 00:20:05,294
We need to go to the washroom. Let's see here.

534
00:20:05,324 --> 00:20:08,294
Let's go for the area near the kitchen and the washroom.

535
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:11,394
We can jump over here.

536
00:20:11,394 --> 00:20:13,194
Okay.

537
00:20:13,264 --> 00:20:16,564
(The door to the washroom)

538
00:20:16,564 --> 00:20:17,694
(She barely makes it over.)

539
00:20:18,824 --> 00:20:20,424
- We've got a problem. - What?

540
00:20:20,764 --> 00:20:23,194
- My legs are too short to cross. - What?

541
00:20:24,194 --> 00:20:25,894
- Let's just buy more, then. - Okay.

542
00:20:25,894 --> 00:20:27,224
We need all three of them.

543
00:20:27,224 --> 00:20:28,694
It only costs 30 R.

544
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,064
They won't be able to cross.

545
00:20:32,094 --> 00:20:33,394
We have to purchase this as well.

546
00:20:33,394 --> 00:20:35,924
- We have to buy this. - We won't make it across otherwise.

547
00:20:36,824 --> 00:20:38,764
- We need to purchase this area. - Yes.

548
00:20:38,794 --> 00:20:40,694
- That's right. - One, two.

549
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,894
This is looking good.

550
00:20:42,894 --> 00:20:44,894
- Nice. - Good job, everyone.

551
00:20:46,664 --> 00:20:47,824
(Red Team starts purchasing land.)

552
00:20:47,824 --> 00:20:49,034
Let's see.

553
00:20:49,494 --> 00:20:52,324
We have the most money.

554
00:20:52,494 --> 00:20:53,924
We could eat here.

555
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:56,664
Gary, we need to purchase this land...

556
00:20:56,664 --> 00:20:58,494
if we're going to eat sitting down.

557
00:20:58,494 --> 00:21:00,894
Let's get this one and the one over there.

558
00:21:00,894 --> 00:21:02,994
- Good idea. - Just get all of them.

559
00:21:03,164 --> 00:21:05,464
- Gary, we're filthy rich. - Aren't we spending too much?

560
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,964
- Don't worry. - What are we saving up for?

561
00:21:08,724 --> 00:21:11,164
You're spending too lavishly since you started clubbing.

562
00:21:11,164 --> 00:21:13,364
- Isn't this too much? - Not at all.

563
00:21:13,424 --> 00:21:15,664
- What now? - Let's get the 10 R ones.

564
00:21:15,664 --> 00:21:17,394
- We should buy all of them. - Yes.

565
00:21:17,394 --> 00:21:18,994
Can you cover up this area with the tiles?

566
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:20,094
Please cover them.

567
00:21:20,094 --> 00:21:22,264
- We can charge them the toll fee. - This is good.

568
00:21:22,264 --> 00:21:23,364
(Red Team has spent 230 R for the area near the washroom.)

569
00:21:23,364 --> 00:21:25,964
Let's buy the land near the turntable.

570
00:21:25,964 --> 00:21:27,894
- There's a turntable? - Look over there.

571
00:21:27,894 --> 00:21:29,124
Na Rae will want to go over there.

572
00:21:29,124 --> 00:21:30,664
Gary, let's buy the land near the turntable.

573
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,664
- We have 115 R left. - That's a lot.

574
00:21:32,664 --> 00:21:33,964
That's a lot.

575
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:36,364
What are we supposed to do?

576
00:21:36,624 --> 00:21:39,564
This is ridiculous.

577
00:21:39,794 --> 00:21:41,264
Should we buy one over here?

578
00:21:41,564 --> 00:21:43,264
They might be in a hurry to go to the washroom.

579
00:21:43,924 --> 00:21:45,994
- Let's buy this one right here. - Should we?

580
00:21:45,994 --> 00:21:47,464
We have no choice.

581
00:21:47,824 --> 00:21:49,494
What should we do?

582
00:21:49,894 --> 00:21:51,324
That's it for us.

583
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:53,564
How much is that?

584
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:54,794
(Blue Team has 200 R remaining.)

585
00:21:55,864 --> 00:21:57,324
Is it our turn now?

586
00:21:57,764 --> 00:21:59,864
Let's buy the entire area right here.

587
00:21:59,864 --> 00:22:01,024
- Sounds good. - Okay.

588
00:22:01,024 --> 00:22:02,994
We need to buy them all.

589
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:05,494
We'll purchase the entire vacant area.

590
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:06,824
How much is that?

591
00:22:07,224 --> 00:22:08,594
It's 390 R.

592
00:22:08,964 --> 00:22:10,564
Do you think we spent too much?

593
00:22:12,494 --> 00:22:13,494
You guys are cheating.

594
00:22:13,494 --> 00:22:16,364
(The dangerous game begins now.)

595
00:22:16,424 --> 00:22:17,864
(You can easily go bankrupt.)

596
00:22:18,224 --> 00:22:19,824
I know it's somewhere.

597
00:22:19,824 --> 00:22:23,524
(Who will go bankrupt and receive the penalty?)

598
00:22:24,624 --> 00:22:26,624
You've all purchased your lands.

599
00:22:26,794 --> 00:22:30,064
Before you go inside, I'll tell you the rules of No Way Out Race.

600
00:22:30,424 --> 00:22:32,024
The number one rule is that...

601
00:22:32,024 --> 00:22:34,824
you can only stay on the area you've purchased.

602
00:22:34,994 --> 00:22:37,364
If you step on someone else's land,

603
00:22:37,364 --> 00:22:40,024
you have to pay the toll fee.

604
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:41,794
That's too harsh.

605
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,364
That's way too harsh.

606
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,494
- We'll be fine. - If you're hungry,

607
00:22:46,494 --> 00:22:48,594
you can purchase food with your R money...

608
00:22:48,594 --> 00:22:51,294
from the snack bar outside.

609
00:22:51,294 --> 00:22:54,064
It's up to you how you spend your money.

610
00:22:54,064 --> 00:22:55,294
How are we going to get out?

611
00:22:55,294 --> 00:22:57,394
If you want to eat,

612
00:22:57,394 --> 00:22:58,794
- you have to go over our land. - I got it.

613
00:23:01,194 --> 00:23:02,324
Gosh, you little...

614
00:23:05,224 --> 00:23:07,424
(What are you doing?)

615
00:23:07,794 --> 00:23:09,494
(Let's see what happens when you tease me again.)

616
00:23:09,564 --> 00:23:11,094
- Why'd you do that? - Good job.

617
00:23:11,094 --> 00:23:13,824
We have ladies watching.

618
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:17,464
At least Sol Bin turned away. Why'd you two look?

619
00:23:17,594 --> 00:23:18,694
Thanks for that.

620
00:23:19,194 --> 00:23:22,494
(It was a great sight to see.)

621
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,894
Don't picture it in your head.

622
00:23:23,894 --> 00:23:24,994
Don't.

623
00:23:25,224 --> 00:23:26,764
(Please forget about what you just saw.)

624
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:29,524
You can now go inside.

625
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:30,594
Let's go inside.

626
00:23:31,464 --> 00:23:32,824
Let's take the tolls first.

627
00:23:32,824 --> 00:23:34,494
- Pay up. - Hold on.

628
00:23:34,724 --> 00:23:36,294
They can make their way around our land.

629
00:23:36,464 --> 00:23:38,194
- I see. - Go sideways.

630
00:23:38,194 --> 00:23:39,564
- Let's go, Gary. - This is easy.

631
00:23:39,564 --> 00:23:41,894
- We have to charge them. - You have to let us in at least.

632
00:23:41,894 --> 00:23:43,524
Give me the money first.

633
00:23:43,524 --> 00:23:44,664
I have a suggestion.

634
00:23:45,064 --> 00:23:47,594
Why don't we intentionally step on Orange Team's land?

635
00:23:48,064 --> 00:23:49,824
- That's a good idea. - I don't want to pay Red Team.

636
00:23:49,824 --> 00:23:52,294
- Let's do that. - Who needs Red Team?

637
00:23:52,294 --> 00:23:53,664
We'll give you a discount.

638
00:23:53,664 --> 00:23:55,764
- Thank you. - Thank you.

639
00:23:55,764 --> 00:23:57,164
- Orange Team! - Orange Team!

640
00:23:57,194 --> 00:23:59,924
- Orange Team! - Orange Team!

641
00:23:59,964 --> 00:24:01,924
Their land and ours cost the same 10 R.

642
00:24:01,924 --> 00:24:03,994
We're going to give them a discount.

643
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:05,324
You can't do that.

644
00:24:05,324 --> 00:24:06,694
Isn't five R too expensive?

645
00:24:06,694 --> 00:24:08,724
We can negotiate the price.

646
00:24:08,724 --> 00:24:10,794
We'll let you go with two R.

647
00:24:10,794 --> 00:24:13,294
- Two R? - Two R?

648
00:24:13,294 --> 00:24:15,894
Did you say two R?

649
00:24:15,894 --> 00:24:17,864
- We'll do one R. - What?

650
00:24:17,864 --> 00:24:20,164
- Let's go with that. - Orange Team!

651
00:24:20,164 --> 00:24:22,664
- Orange Team! - One R?

652
00:24:22,664 --> 00:24:24,464
Just pick which one you want to step on.

653
00:24:25,024 --> 00:24:26,694
Be careful or you might step on our land.

654
00:24:26,694 --> 00:24:28,764
If you do,

655
00:24:28,764 --> 00:24:30,824
we'll charge you the usual price.

656
00:24:30,824 --> 00:24:33,194
- You heard him. - It'll be five R.

657
00:24:33,194 --> 00:24:34,464
It's not too late to pay us.

658
00:24:34,464 --> 00:24:35,724
This is your last chance.

659
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,424
- I see. - It's one R, right, Jong Kook?

660
00:24:37,424 --> 00:24:39,564
- Yes. - Let's go.

661
00:24:39,564 --> 00:24:40,624
Can you get on my back, Se Chan?

662
00:24:40,664 --> 00:24:41,664
- Se Chan. - I can't.

663
00:24:41,664 --> 00:24:44,294
- Just try. - Yes, I'm fine.

664
00:24:44,294 --> 00:24:45,594
(Oh no)

665
00:24:45,594 --> 00:24:46,864
That's 20 R in total.

666
00:24:46,964 --> 00:24:48,394
- Can you start moving? - Hey!

667
00:24:48,394 --> 00:24:49,664
- Can you start moving? - Hey!

668
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:52,464
(Kwang Soo's shoes got stuck on the carpet.)

669
00:24:52,464 --> 00:24:53,964
That's 20 R.

670
00:24:53,964 --> 00:24:56,124
That's 20 R.

671
00:24:56,164 --> 00:24:58,494
Pay up.

672
00:24:58,494 --> 00:25:00,564
- It's 20 R. - The floor was sticky.

673
00:25:00,564 --> 00:25:02,264
- Give us the money. - You don't understand.

674
00:25:02,264 --> 00:25:05,064
- The floor was sticky. - What was that?

675
00:25:05,064 --> 00:25:07,124
- This is a foul. - That's too bad.

676
00:25:07,124 --> 00:25:08,824
- We have to start over. - Is this...

677
00:25:08,824 --> 00:25:09,824
Someone pushed us.

678
00:25:09,824 --> 00:25:11,724
Isn't this for catching bugs?

679
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:13,824
Why is it so sticky?

680
00:25:14,294 --> 00:25:15,764
This is not going to work.

681
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,224
- We picked the right area. - This is good.

682
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,894
Let's just give them the money.

683
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:20,564
- That'll be one R each. - Okay.

684
00:25:20,564 --> 00:25:22,324
- Pay up. - That's better.

685
00:25:22,324 --> 00:25:25,464
- That's one R. - Okay.

686
00:25:25,464 --> 00:25:27,764
You can make it over with just three R.

687
00:25:27,764 --> 00:25:29,364
Just step on the orange one.

688
00:25:29,364 --> 00:25:30,724
Step on the orange one.

689
00:25:30,724 --> 00:25:32,964
I'll help you jump over.

690
00:25:33,864 --> 00:25:35,494
- Step on the red. - That's two R.

691
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:37,564
- That's three. - Good.

692
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:40,094
That's four.

693
00:25:40,724 --> 00:25:42,424
- Make the jump. - That's five.

694
00:25:42,424 --> 00:25:43,994
Just go slowly.

695
00:25:44,024 --> 00:25:46,094
That's 6, 7...

696
00:25:46,424 --> 00:25:48,924
and eight.

697
00:25:49,394 --> 00:25:51,194
That's eight R in total.

698
00:25:51,194 --> 00:25:53,064
Get down from there, Seok Jin.

699
00:25:53,064 --> 00:25:55,294
- We'll let you all go with 10 R. - Okay.

700
00:25:55,294 --> 00:25:56,564
- 10 R for all three of us? - Yes.

701
00:25:56,564 --> 00:25:58,164
Let's go.

702
00:25:58,164 --> 00:25:59,564
That'll do it.

703
00:25:59,564 --> 00:26:01,424
Nice.

704
00:26:03,324 --> 00:26:05,164
(He steps on Orange Team's land.)

705
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:07,294
Oh, no.

706
00:26:08,194 --> 00:26:09,724
Oh, no.

707
00:26:09,894 --> 00:26:11,794
That'll be one R.

708
00:26:11,794 --> 00:26:13,194
You stepped on it.

709
00:26:13,194 --> 00:26:14,794
No, he didn't.

710
00:26:14,794 --> 00:26:16,394
(Why is it so hard to come home?)

711
00:26:16,394 --> 00:26:18,024
I'm going to jump.

712
00:26:18,024 --> 00:26:20,524
- What? - I think I can do this.

713
00:26:20,524 --> 00:26:21,564
You're really doing it?

714
00:26:21,594 --> 00:26:23,024
(Here I go.)

715
00:26:23,024 --> 00:26:24,064
You're really doing it?

716
00:26:24,064 --> 00:26:27,964
(Fly like a butterfly, land like a bee.)

717
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:33,664
(Jae Seok interrupts him.)

718
00:26:33,664 --> 00:26:34,924
You stepped on our land.

719
00:26:34,924 --> 00:26:36,064
Pay up.

720
00:26:36,564 --> 00:26:38,324
That'll be two R.

721
00:26:38,324 --> 00:26:40,464
- Give us the money. - I'll go now.

722
00:26:40,564 --> 00:26:42,694
We'll let you all go with 10 R.

723
00:26:42,694 --> 00:26:43,994
- Okay. - Off you go.

724
00:26:43,994 --> 00:26:45,394
Thanks.

725
00:26:45,394 --> 00:26:47,164
- You can just step on our land. - You can go.

726
00:26:47,164 --> 00:26:49,364
That'll be 10 R.

727
00:26:49,594 --> 00:26:51,064
What now?

728
00:26:51,064 --> 00:26:52,664
You'll have to jump all the way over there.

729
00:26:52,664 --> 00:26:54,064
Here it goes.

730
00:26:54,064 --> 00:26:55,894
You could get hurt.

731
00:26:55,894 --> 00:26:57,924
(He hops over.)

732
00:26:58,024 --> 00:26:59,924
- That was amazing. - How'd he do that?

733
00:27:00,264 --> 00:27:01,324
Oh, my.

734
00:27:01,324 --> 00:27:02,364
Jong Kook, move over.

735
00:27:02,364 --> 00:27:04,364
- Okay. - I'm going to keep an eye on you.

736
00:27:04,364 --> 00:27:06,294
He's not going to make it.

737
00:27:06,294 --> 00:27:07,294
(He hops over.)

738
00:27:07,564 --> 00:27:09,694
It's Sol Bin's turn.

739
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:10,764
- Be careful. - You dropped this.

740
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:12,324
Be careful, Sol Bin.

741
00:27:12,794 --> 00:27:13,864
(She screams...)

742
00:27:13,864 --> 00:27:15,094
(and falls over.)

743
00:27:16,924 --> 00:27:17,994
(I tripped myself.)

744
00:27:17,994 --> 00:27:20,024
- What are you doing? - That'll be five R.

745
00:27:20,024 --> 00:27:21,824
Ours is five R, too.

746
00:27:21,824 --> 00:27:23,624
- It's five R. - Congratulations.

747
00:27:23,624 --> 00:27:25,024
Give us the money.

748
00:27:25,024 --> 00:27:26,694
- It's five R. - We're not giving you a discount.

749
00:27:26,694 --> 00:27:28,294
It's five R.

750
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:29,694
It's five R.

751
00:27:29,794 --> 00:27:31,324
Give us the money.

752
00:27:31,324 --> 00:27:32,594
This is nice.

753
00:27:32,594 --> 00:27:33,864
- Take a seat. - We have chairs.

754
00:27:33,864 --> 00:27:35,094
This is nice.

755
00:27:35,394 --> 00:27:36,564
This is comfortable.

756
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:39,424
This was a good buy.

757
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,024
You don't have a couch.

758
00:27:41,864 --> 00:27:43,164
This is so comfortable.

759
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:44,694
You guys are hilarious.

760
00:27:44,694 --> 00:27:47,394
What are you doing on that couch with all this empty space?

761
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:48,624
What are you doing over there?

762
00:27:48,694 --> 00:27:51,324
Kyu Han said this is the Green Belt.

763
00:27:51,764 --> 00:27:53,564
There's nothing there for them.

764
00:27:53,694 --> 00:27:55,394
- How much money did we make? - You don't know that.

765
00:27:55,394 --> 00:27:56,724
- We made a lot. - I heard it's getting redeveloped.

766
00:27:56,724 --> 00:27:58,124
How are you going to eat?

767
00:27:58,264 --> 00:27:59,294
- What? - How are you going to eat?

768
00:27:59,294 --> 00:28:00,864
We'll order delivery.

769
00:28:01,464 --> 00:28:02,524
We'll have delivery food.

770
00:28:02,524 --> 00:28:03,564
- Do you want some ramyeon? - Let's go outside...

771
00:28:03,564 --> 00:28:04,894
- and get some ramyeon. - Let's go.

772
00:28:04,894 --> 00:28:06,994
- Let's get some ramyeon. - Excuse me.

773
00:28:07,264 --> 00:28:09,564
- Can you get some for us, too? - I'll go.

774
00:28:09,694 --> 00:28:11,294
- Gary. - What?

775
00:28:11,294 --> 00:28:12,364
Where are you going?

776
00:28:12,394 --> 00:28:14,124
What kind of ramyeon do you want?

777
00:28:14,124 --> 00:28:15,994
- Can you get some for us as well? - I don't really care.

778
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:18,964
This is really comfortable.

779
00:28:19,494 --> 00:28:21,694
(Red Team bought all the land near the entrance.)

780
00:28:23,394 --> 00:28:25,164
The house is quite big.

781
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:29,194
Things on the menu are quite expensive.

782
00:28:29,724 --> 00:28:32,264
Can I have three cup noodles?

783
00:28:32,324 --> 00:28:33,664
Yes. Three of them.

784
00:28:34,064 --> 00:28:35,094
(They will cost 60 R.)

785
00:28:35,094 --> 00:28:37,594
60 R please.

786
00:28:37,864 --> 00:28:39,524
- 60 R? Why? - Yes.

787
00:28:39,994 --> 00:28:42,864
- Cup noodles costs 20 R each. - 20 R each? Wait a minute.

788
00:28:43,464 --> 00:28:45,064
How much are those packaged noodles?

789
00:28:45,964 --> 00:28:47,494
I will buy three packaged noodles instead.

790
00:28:47,494 --> 00:28:48,524
- Are you sure? - Yes.

791
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:53,264
We give a pair of chopsticks if you buy cup noodles.

792
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:54,764
But you don't get any if you buy packaged noodles.

793
00:28:55,664 --> 00:28:57,024
(Do we have to buy chopsticks? That's so cruel.)

794
00:28:57,024 --> 00:28:58,394
- You have to buy them separately. - How much are they?

795
00:28:58,694 --> 00:29:00,624
- A pair of them costs 10 R. - 10 R for chopsticks?

796
00:29:00,624 --> 00:29:01,724
Yes. Really.

797
00:29:02,164 --> 00:29:03,994
10 R for a pair of chopsticks is crazy.

798
00:29:04,664 --> 00:29:05,794
Then you should buy cup noodles.

799
00:29:05,794 --> 00:29:06,994
Okay. I'll buy cup noodles.

800
00:29:06,994 --> 00:29:08,464
(No matter what he buys, he has to spend 20 R.)

801
00:29:08,464 --> 00:29:11,524
How can you sell a pair of chopsticks separately?

802
00:29:11,524 --> 00:29:13,864
It's usually free if I buy noodles at the convenience store.

803
00:29:15,394 --> 00:29:17,194
- I will deliver these for you. - Oh, will you?

804
00:29:17,194 --> 00:29:18,824
- Yes. Just pay me 10 R and... - No, thank you.

805
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,964
You're really greedy.

806
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:24,794
- Come again. - Bye.

807
00:29:28,064 --> 00:29:30,264
(The kitchen is ours. Let's cook some noodles. Shall we?)

808
00:29:30,294 --> 00:29:33,094
(We don't have any money but we'd like some too.)

809
00:29:33,494 --> 00:29:35,694
- Let's buy something together. - Shall we?

810
00:29:35,924 --> 00:29:38,064
- Let's collect money. - Can we pass through their area?

811
00:29:38,064 --> 00:29:40,094
All right. Let's see how much money we have. How much do you have?

812
00:29:40,464 --> 00:29:42,624
- We only have 50 R. - Only 50 R?

813
00:29:42,624 --> 00:29:43,724
Where can we earn more R money?

814
00:29:44,094 --> 00:29:45,864
- We don't have any money left. - So we have 50 R.

815
00:29:45,864 --> 00:29:47,294
We have to buy chopsticks separately.

816
00:29:48,124 --> 00:29:51,124
- We will go out and buy them. - Let's just split the toll fee.

817
00:29:51,394 --> 00:29:53,694
Hey. Orange Team.

818
00:29:53,694 --> 00:29:56,624
How much is it for a round trip?

819
00:29:56,624 --> 00:29:57,864
- Round trip? - Yes.

820
00:29:58,694 --> 00:29:59,864
Pay us five R for it.

821
00:30:01,064 --> 00:30:02,624
- How much is it? - Five R for a round trip.

822
00:30:02,624 --> 00:30:03,924
Five R for a round trip sounds reasonable.

823
00:30:03,924 --> 00:30:05,024
All right. Pass through.

824
00:30:05,024 --> 00:30:07,064
- Hurry up. Go. - Check the prices before buying.

825
00:30:07,064 --> 00:30:09,924
(They pay the Orange Team 5 R for a round trip.)

826
00:30:10,294 --> 00:30:12,724
- It's tough. - We bought the wrong area.

827
00:30:12,724 --> 00:30:14,924
We have to pay every time we want to go somewhere.

828
00:30:14,924 --> 00:30:16,964
- Hello, Ms Do. - Hello.

829
00:30:16,994 --> 00:30:19,694
- Hi, there. - Give us two packaged noodles.

830
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:21,394
- Would two be enough? - Packaged noodles sound okay.

831
00:30:21,624 --> 00:30:22,694
How many do you want? Three? Four?

832
00:30:22,694 --> 00:30:23,994
- Let's buy three. - Three will be enough.

833
00:30:24,264 --> 00:30:26,924
Should we buy a dried filefish fillet? It costs only 10 R.

834
00:30:26,924 --> 00:30:29,994
Shouldn't we buy something to drink, too?

835
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,264
We can drink the soup from the noodles.

836
00:30:32,524 --> 00:30:36,364
(We can't afford water. It's too expensive.)

837
00:30:37,194 --> 00:30:38,724
- Let's buy an egg. Shall we? - An egg?

838
00:30:38,724 --> 00:30:40,194
(They keep buying.)

839
00:30:40,194 --> 00:30:41,864
- Let's buy an egg. - We don't have any eggs.

840
00:30:42,124 --> 00:30:43,794
- Oh, they do have eggs. - Thank you.

841
00:30:43,794 --> 00:30:45,924
- Bye, Ms Do. - Bye.

842
00:30:45,924 --> 00:30:47,264
What should we buy?

843
00:30:47,524 --> 00:30:49,594
Hear me, Kwang Soo. We should lie about the prices.

844
00:30:49,724 --> 00:30:53,424
Let's tell them that we paid 30 R for each and ask 15 R.

845
00:30:53,794 --> 00:30:56,724
We can sell these noodles for 30 R and earn 10 R in total.

846
00:30:57,624 --> 00:30:58,994
30 R sounds really expensive.

847
00:30:58,994 --> 00:31:01,124
No, 30 R for two packages is fine. We'll tell them we paid 15 R each.

848
00:31:01,394 --> 00:31:03,064
Let's tell them we paid 40 R for this dried filefish fillet.

849
00:31:04,294 --> 00:31:07,994
- We must eat something first... - We can cook any time we want.

850
00:31:07,994 --> 00:31:09,994
- to deal with other things later. - I'm sure we can.

851
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:11,924
- Gosh. - We shouldn't eat noodles...

852
00:31:11,924 --> 00:31:13,924
- Gosh. It hurts. - My gosh.

853
00:31:13,924 --> 00:31:16,364
(Jong Kook pretends to be gravely injured.)

854
00:31:16,364 --> 00:31:19,024
What's wrong with you? How can you hurt him like that?

855
00:31:19,024 --> 00:31:20,494
- Look at him. He's in pain. - Gosh, it really hurts.

856
00:31:20,494 --> 00:31:22,324
- Where's the manager? - Call the manager.

857
00:31:22,324 --> 00:31:25,324
Is this how you treat your customers? He's really weak.

858
00:31:25,424 --> 00:31:28,424
- He gets hurt so easily. - The board hit me. It really hurts.

859
00:31:28,424 --> 00:31:30,294
Please stop that nonsense. Would you?

860
00:31:30,824 --> 00:31:33,024
- You must pay 10 R for that. - No. I'll pay five R.

861
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:35,994
- Come on. You know him. - I will only pay five R.

862
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,224
He's a good fighter.

863
00:31:37,594 --> 00:31:39,294
(Really?)

864
00:31:39,294 --> 00:31:41,464
- I won't pay 10 R. - All right, then.

865
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:42,794
Five R sounds okay.

866
00:31:43,594 --> 00:31:44,924
Don't tell others. Please.

867
00:31:44,924 --> 00:31:46,194
- Don't worry, we won't. - Okay. I'll pay five R.

868
00:31:46,194 --> 00:31:48,094
- Are you all right, Jong Kook? - Gosh. It really hurts.

869
00:31:48,094 --> 00:31:50,594
- That was your fault, wasn't it? - You should've put it properly.

870
00:31:50,594 --> 00:31:51,924
- I'm sorry. - Here is your five R.

871
00:31:52,194 --> 00:31:54,324
- Gosh, I'm too kind. - My goodness.

872
00:31:54,324 --> 00:31:56,594
You must be an angel. I've never seen anyone like you.

873
00:31:56,594 --> 00:31:58,764
- I'll forgive him for only five R. - You're so generous.

874
00:31:59,594 --> 00:32:01,664
- Here is your five R. Take it. - Okay.

875
00:32:02,724 --> 00:32:03,924
Thank you.

876
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:05,294
- Hope your business goes well. - Okay. Bye.

877
00:32:05,564 --> 00:32:08,264
- I nearly got injured. - What's wrong with him?

878
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:09,764
(They finish their shopping.)

879
00:32:09,764 --> 00:32:11,664
- These are all we could afford. - Haha.

880
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:13,994
- All right. How much were they? - We paid 20 R for each.

881
00:32:14,824 --> 00:32:17,424
- 20 R? Really? - Yes. This was 30 R.

882
00:32:18,124 --> 00:32:19,664
- So it cost 30 R each? - No, 20 R.

883
00:32:19,664 --> 00:32:20,724
These noodles were 20 R each and this was...

884
00:32:20,724 --> 00:32:23,064
Hold on a second. Didn't you tell us that you only had 50 R?

885
00:32:23,064 --> 00:32:26,824
- They cost way more than 50 R... - Sol Bin,

886
00:32:26,824 --> 00:32:28,694
- listen to him first. - so it doesn't make any sense.

887
00:32:28,694 --> 00:32:30,764
- They cost 100 R altogether. - Sol Bin is really smart.

888
00:32:30,764 --> 00:32:33,664
- You're trying to overcharge us. - No. That's not true.

889
00:32:33,664 --> 00:32:35,164
In fact, we had more than 50 R.

890
00:32:35,164 --> 00:32:37,994
Do you think it makes sense? No way.

891
00:32:37,994 --> 00:32:40,224
I'm sorry. We're really short on money.

892
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:42,824
I'm so glad that we can stay out of their fight.

893
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,364
Really.

894
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:46,524
I'm so glad that I'm not the one who is arguing with you.

895
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:48,464
We will pay you 10 R.

896
00:32:48,964 --> 00:32:51,194
- We... - Let's cook our noodles together.

897
00:32:51,364 --> 00:32:52,864
We'll pay 10 R for using the kitchen.

898
00:32:52,864 --> 00:32:53,924
- Okay. - Let's pay five R each.

899
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:55,624
I'll pay you four R.

900
00:32:56,024 --> 00:32:57,994
Don't be so stingy.

901
00:32:58,094 --> 00:33:00,964
- We're running out of money. - I know you can afford five R.

902
00:33:01,524 --> 00:33:02,764
Should we eat one uncooked?

903
00:33:02,764 --> 00:33:04,464
- Shall we? - Okay. Let's eat it that way.

904
00:33:04,464 --> 00:33:06,394
- All right. Gather up here. - Sit in a circle.

905
00:33:06,394 --> 00:33:07,564
Uncooked noodles is a good appetiser.

906
00:33:08,264 --> 00:33:11,264
- We're a team. Don't betray us. - All right.

907
00:33:11,464 --> 00:33:12,864
You can count on me.

908
00:33:13,924 --> 00:33:15,024
It looks good.

909
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:16,464
It's really delicious.

910
00:33:16,964 --> 00:33:18,994
- Wow. This is delicious. - It really is.

911
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,264
Your noodles are ready.

912
00:33:21,264 --> 00:33:22,494
Okay.

913
00:33:22,494 --> 00:33:23,764
Please come and take it.

914
00:33:25,164 --> 00:33:27,124
- My goodness. - Amazing.

915
00:33:28,694 --> 00:33:30,264
Seok Jin, here's your bowl.

916
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:33,524
- How is it? - I'm fine. You can have it.

917
00:33:33,564 --> 00:33:35,424
- Those noodles look so delicious. - They really do.

918
00:33:35,424 --> 00:33:36,624
(They paid almost everything for this.)

919
00:33:37,794 --> 00:33:40,994
- It smells great, too. - Hey. How are your noodles?

920
00:33:40,994 --> 00:33:44,764
- Are they cooking something? - We're cooking kimchi jjim soon.

921
00:33:44,764 --> 00:33:46,264
- Are they cooking kimchi jjim? - We're boiling water already.

922
00:33:46,264 --> 00:33:47,524
- They even have samgyeopsal. - How are your noodles?

923
00:33:47,524 --> 00:33:50,764
- We have 1.5kg of samgyeopsal. - My goodness.

924
00:33:50,764 --> 00:33:52,924
We also have ripened kimchi from two years ago.

925
00:33:52,924 --> 00:33:54,394
- Here's the samgyeopsal. - How much is it?

926
00:33:54,394 --> 00:33:56,894
I'll tell you later after we finish cooking.

927
00:33:57,524 --> 00:34:01,224
(First, they put in the ripened kimchi.)

928
00:34:01,224 --> 00:34:03,124
It smells really delicious.

929
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:05,494
- That's amazing. - I can smell it, too.

930
00:34:05,494 --> 00:34:07,694
- Look at her. - That kimchi jjim must be awesome.

931
00:34:07,694 --> 00:34:09,824
- My goodness. - Look at her.

932
00:34:09,824 --> 00:34:12,494
- Look at Na Rae. - It smells awesome.

933
00:34:12,494 --> 00:34:16,264
She is cooking, but she seems really relaxed and comfortable.

934
00:34:16,964 --> 00:34:18,564
Look at Na Rae. She's amazing.

935
00:34:18,564 --> 00:34:20,994
(Here comes the special ingredient,)

936
00:34:20,994 --> 00:34:22,934
(MSG powder.)

937
00:34:23,624 --> 00:34:26,864
(We should call it MSG jjim instead of kimchi jjim.)

938
00:34:28,794 --> 00:34:32,064
(How would MSG jjim taste like?)

939
00:34:32,964 --> 00:34:34,024
It's amazing.

940
00:34:34,464 --> 00:34:35,864
This is really delicious.

941
00:34:35,864 --> 00:34:37,224
(They are enjoying their noodles.)

942
00:34:37,224 --> 00:34:38,364
It's amazing.

943
00:34:38,364 --> 00:34:40,364
(Seok Jin must be thirsty.)

944
00:34:40,364 --> 00:34:41,494
It's really delicious.

945
00:34:43,194 --> 00:34:45,594
(Orange Team has enough water to quench their thirst.)

946
00:34:46,894 --> 00:34:48,624
Excuse me.

947
00:34:48,624 --> 00:34:51,064
- May I have a glass of water? - Do you want some water?

948
00:34:51,064 --> 00:34:53,124
- Yes. I'm really thirsty. - It's two R.

949
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,764
I'm really thirsty.

950
00:34:54,764 --> 00:34:56,524
Show us how much water we get for two R, first.

951
00:34:56,524 --> 00:34:57,724
Here. You'll get a bowl of water.

952
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:00,394
- I will pay one R for that. - Yes. We'll pay one R.

953
00:35:03,594 --> 00:35:06,494
- That's not one R. It's an egg. - We will give you this egg instead.

954
00:35:06,764 --> 00:35:08,394
We will give you this egg instead of one R.

955
00:35:08,394 --> 00:35:11,724
No way. Gary paid 10 R for this bottle of water.

956
00:35:11,724 --> 00:35:13,494
- 10 R for a bottle of water? - We'll give you half the bottle...

957
00:35:13,494 --> 00:35:15,594
- for two R. - It's really expensive.

958
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,324
- It's a good deal. - We shouldn't buy it, guys.

959
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,434
- Aren't you thirsty? - It's only two R.

960
00:35:19,434 --> 00:35:21,264
- Two R sounds okay. - We should buy it.

961
00:35:21,294 --> 00:35:23,194
- Are you sure? - Let's put this over there first.

962
00:35:23,194 --> 00:35:26,494
(Blue Team decides to store their water for later use.)

963
00:35:27,264 --> 00:35:28,764
- Do you mean this one? - Yes.

964
00:35:29,564 --> 00:35:30,764
- Hey, Kwang Soo. - What?

965
00:35:31,164 --> 00:35:35,624
(There's some water over there.)

966
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:37,764
- I wonder who it was. - We can't sit down and eat.

967
00:35:37,764 --> 00:35:38,994
- No. We can sit here and eat. - You can sit here and eat.

968
00:35:38,994 --> 00:35:40,934
(Really? Can we take it for free?)

969
00:35:40,934 --> 00:35:43,024
- Blue Team members can eat it. - Yes, we can.

970
00:35:45,364 --> 00:35:50,894
(Kwang Soo takes the bowl of water from Blue Team's shelf.)

971
00:35:53,664 --> 00:35:55,794
(What is he doing?)

972
00:35:56,094 --> 00:35:58,064
(Gulping)

973
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,724
(We want to drink, too.)

974
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:06,664
(Isn't that...)

975
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,294
(our water?)

976
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:10,324
What are you doing?

977
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,364
Hey.

978
00:36:12,364 --> 00:36:13,794
You filthy thieves!

979
00:36:14,364 --> 00:36:15,794
Who took the bowl filled with water from this shelf?

980
00:36:16,694 --> 00:36:17,724
- It's not me. - Where's our water?

981
00:36:17,724 --> 00:36:19,194
- It's gone. - It's right over there.

982
00:36:19,194 --> 00:36:20,864
- Where? - Where is it? We didn't do it.

983
00:36:21,164 --> 00:36:23,524
- Hey. How could you do that? - We didn't do it.

984
00:36:23,964 --> 00:36:26,194
Do you mean this book? I can't drink this book.

985
00:36:26,194 --> 00:36:27,764
We're done. I mean it.

986
00:36:28,294 --> 00:36:30,094
You took our water.

987
00:36:30,094 --> 00:36:31,964
(The alliance between Blue Team and Green Team is about to end.)

988
00:36:32,194 --> 00:36:34,264
- How could you do this? - Look at that.

989
00:36:34,464 --> 00:36:36,124
- I didn't even sip it. - You must pay four R for the water.

990
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,524
- Come on, Haha. - Take this and pay four R.

991
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:41,494
- You took our water. - That was our water.

992
00:36:41,494 --> 00:36:42,894
(Na Rae's kimchi jjim is ready.)

993
00:36:42,894 --> 00:36:44,164
Wow. It looks amazing.

994
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:45,794
Excuse me.

995
00:36:46,094 --> 00:36:48,264
Hey. Hold on a minute.

996
00:36:48,264 --> 00:36:49,494
Seok Jin, hold on a minute.

997
00:36:50,064 --> 00:36:52,064
- Here. Take this. - There's some samgyeopsal, too.

998
00:36:52,064 --> 00:36:53,894
- It's really delicious. - We should buy that kimchi jjim.

999
00:36:53,894 --> 00:36:57,164
Hey. How much is that kimchi jjim?

1000
00:36:57,164 --> 00:36:59,994
- Do you want a dish of kimchi jjim? - Yes.

1001
00:37:00,564 --> 00:37:01,824
(I'd love to have a bite.)

1002
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,264
All right, everyone.

1003
00:37:03,994 --> 00:37:05,564
- It's 15 R. - I'll buy it.

1004
00:37:05,564 --> 00:37:08,264
(I'll gladly pay 15 R for that kimchi jjim!)

1005
00:37:08,264 --> 00:37:09,694
- It's 15 R. - We'll eat it.

1006
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,694
- We will pay 15 R. - Yes, we will.

1007
00:37:11,694 --> 00:37:13,934
- I'll gladly pay it. - You owe a great deal of money.

1008
00:37:13,934 --> 00:37:15,564
- Come on. We'll pay the money. - It must be really delicious.

1009
00:37:15,564 --> 00:37:19,294
(However, Green Team cannot afford the kimchi jjim.)

1010
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:22,024
We should've saved up some money instead of buying so much land.

1011
00:37:22,024 --> 00:37:26,364
(I'll sell this area for kimchi jjim.)

1012
00:37:29,694 --> 00:37:30,894
- No. - What are you doing?

1013
00:37:30,894 --> 00:37:32,764
(Seok Jin, we mustn't sell our land.)

1014
00:37:32,764 --> 00:37:34,294
- Come on. Let's sell our land. - No, we shouldn't.

1015
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:36,064
- Let's sell it and eat kimchi jjim. - No. Please don't.

1016
00:37:36,324 --> 00:37:38,194
Let's just sell our land and enjoy.

1017
00:37:38,194 --> 00:37:41,824
(Other teams are enjoying their lovely kimchi jjim.)

1018
00:37:41,824 --> 00:37:43,624
- I gave you some extra meat. - Really? Thank you.

1019
00:37:43,624 --> 00:37:46,864
- You're welcome. - Thank you so much.

1020
00:37:49,164 --> 00:37:50,264
It's really delicious.

1021
00:37:50,264 --> 00:37:51,864
She should open her own restaurant.

1022
00:37:52,864 --> 00:37:54,264
I think she can. It's so delicious.

1023
00:37:55,194 --> 00:37:56,324
- Come on. - I won't let you sell our land.

1024
00:37:56,894 --> 00:37:58,864
Let's sell the land and enjoy what we can.

1025
00:37:58,994 --> 00:38:01,164
(No. We won't sell our land.)

1026
00:38:01,164 --> 00:38:02,224
- Hey. - I'm sorry.

1027
00:38:02,224 --> 00:38:03,434
- Let's sell the land. - Wait.

1028
00:38:06,294 --> 00:38:07,494
What is that?

1029
00:38:07,664 --> 00:38:09,164
It's time for a move-in celebration.

1030
00:38:09,494 --> 00:38:11,264
You must be really happy to move into your new home.

1031
00:38:11,264 --> 00:38:13,224
Why don't you buy some food to celebrate each other?

1032
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,364
(What do you mean by "move-in celebration"?)

1033
00:38:15,464 --> 00:38:18,434
"Each team must choose a team and buy two dishes of food for them."

1034
00:38:18,434 --> 00:38:19,934
You can buy food from the cafeteria.

1035
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:21,364
You must eat all the food you've received.

1036
00:38:21,364 --> 00:38:22,894
- So we must assign a team... - We will get food from other teams.

1037
00:38:22,894 --> 00:38:25,164
Don't we have to buy the food?

1038
00:38:25,164 --> 00:38:27,324
Isn't this for some kind of attack?

1039
00:38:27,364 --> 00:38:29,394
Do we make others go to the bathroom?

1040
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:32,294
- There comes the store owner. - There she is.

1041
00:38:32,434 --> 00:38:34,124
Do we sell the land if we don't have any R?

1042
00:38:34,124 --> 00:38:38,594
Yes, you must sell the land to buy two dishes for the assigned teams.

1043
00:38:38,594 --> 00:38:42,594
We have five R, but there's nothing we can buy.

1044
00:38:42,594 --> 00:38:44,694
Please attack my team with watermelon.

1045
00:38:44,694 --> 00:38:46,524
I'm so thirsty.

1046
00:38:47,164 --> 00:38:48,594
Let's attack each other with watermelon.

1047
00:38:48,824 --> 00:38:50,194
Let's do that.

1048
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:52,064
Let's give each other watermelon.

1049
00:38:52,064 --> 00:38:53,194
(Do they agree to exchange watermelons?)

1050
00:38:53,194 --> 00:38:55,494
- Give us watermelon. - Give each team a watermelon.

1051
00:38:55,494 --> 00:38:56,794
That sounds good. Let's have one watermelon.

1052
00:38:56,794 --> 00:38:58,464
- Right now, Kyu Han is... - It's hard to hold it.

1053
00:38:58,464 --> 00:39:00,864
Okay, let's get one watermelon.

1054
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,864
Get him one watermelon and some sports drink.

1055
00:39:02,864 --> 00:39:05,694
- He's trying so hard. - All right, please pay up.

1056
00:39:06,024 --> 00:39:09,564
(Until then, no one knew...)

1057
00:39:09,564 --> 00:39:17,324
(that the watermelon would cause such a disaster.)

1058
00:39:18,024 --> 00:39:20,164
- What? - We can attack now.

1059
00:39:20,164 --> 00:39:22,824
Sell our land so we can attack.

1060
00:39:23,124 --> 00:39:24,494
What's the use of that piece in the middle?

1061
00:39:24,494 --> 00:39:26,194
Let's sell two pieces of land in the middle.

1062
00:39:26,194 --> 00:39:28,024
No, sell the piece at the edge.

1063
00:39:28,024 --> 00:39:30,564
We don't need to get to that sofa. Let's sell it.

1064
00:39:30,564 --> 00:39:31,964
Does anyone want to buy it for cheap?

1065
00:39:31,964 --> 00:39:33,164
- No. - No one wants it.

1066
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:35,434
- We'll sell it for seven R. - Pardon me?

1067
00:39:35,434 --> 00:39:37,564
- The bank would buy it for five R. - Seok Jin.

1068
00:39:37,564 --> 00:39:39,464
Its appraised value is five R.

1069
00:39:40,464 --> 00:39:43,564
- That's not what I mean. Listen. - You insist on a higher price.

1070
00:39:43,564 --> 00:39:46,594
- If you pay me seven R... - Don't say seven R.

1071
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:47,664
(Be careful of the pronunciation.)

1072
00:39:47,664 --> 00:39:49,264
(How dare you call for seven R?)

1073
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:51,224
What did you say?

1074
00:39:51,224 --> 00:39:52,864
Seven R?

1075
00:39:52,864 --> 00:39:54,064
Let's not price it seven R.

1076
00:39:54,064 --> 00:39:55,664
- Watch your words. - I said seven R.

1077
00:39:55,664 --> 00:39:57,124
(His words were misunderstood. He meant seven R.)

1078
00:39:57,124 --> 00:39:59,394
What's wrong with what I said? Don't ask for seven R.

1079
00:39:59,394 --> 00:40:01,494
- Goodness. - We don't have much money.

1080
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:04,224
- We don't have much money. - Kwang Soo.

1081
00:40:04,224 --> 00:40:05,864
What's the point of having that piece of land? Sell it.

1082
00:40:05,864 --> 00:40:07,464
You never know if it'll come to use.

1083
00:40:07,464 --> 00:40:10,664
- What's the use if you lose? - Let's have a watermelon party.

1084
00:40:10,764 --> 00:40:13,024
If you don't, we won't give you watermelon, either.

1085
00:40:13,024 --> 00:40:14,964
(Let's just sell it.)

1086
00:40:14,964 --> 00:40:15,964
(Please don't sell the land.)

1087
00:40:15,964 --> 00:40:17,464
Let's sell them all.

1088
00:40:17,864 --> 00:40:19,464
Let me go.

1089
00:40:19,464 --> 00:40:22,664
Please stop, Seok Jin.

1090
00:40:23,064 --> 00:40:24,294
(His shorts are coming off.)

1091
00:40:25,694 --> 00:40:26,964
(Things are a mess for Green Team.)

1092
00:40:26,964 --> 00:40:29,264
He begged and said, "Please stop, Seok Jin."

1093
00:40:29,434 --> 00:40:30,964
Let me go.

1094
00:40:30,964 --> 00:40:32,164
Aren't you sad that...

1095
00:40:32,164 --> 00:40:33,824
- we have no money? - Please stop, Seok Jin.

1096
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:34,864
No, you can't.

1097
00:40:34,864 --> 00:40:36,594
(Let's talk it out instead.)

1098
00:40:36,594 --> 00:40:39,324
- Please, Seok Jin. - We're too poor.

1099
00:40:39,324 --> 00:40:42,164
- Let it go. - He's like a cartoon character.

1100
00:40:42,164 --> 00:40:44,964
(If only the land wasn't part of the greenbelt,)

1101
00:40:44,964 --> 00:40:46,464
(they could sell it.)

1102
00:40:46,464 --> 00:40:48,794
He looks like that grandfather who appears in the cartoon "Dooly".

1103
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,934
You look so pathetic.

1104
00:40:51,124 --> 00:40:52,764
- Here's the watermelon. - Gosh.

1105
00:40:52,764 --> 00:40:55,864
(Watermelon that will make you urinate appears.)

1106
00:40:55,864 --> 00:40:57,724
- Thank you. - Thank you for the watermelon.

1107
00:40:57,934 --> 00:40:59,664
Thank you for the watermelon.

1108
00:40:59,664 --> 00:41:01,194
This watermelon is delicious.

1109
00:41:01,824 --> 00:41:02,864
It's delicious.

1110
00:41:03,434 --> 00:41:04,464
It's sweet.

1111
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:05,864
(Everyone sits around their own land and hydrates.)

1112
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:06,964
It's tasty.

1113
00:41:07,564 --> 00:41:08,964
This is great.

1114
00:41:09,264 --> 00:41:10,264
There are no seeds at all.

1115
00:41:10,264 --> 00:41:12,094
Kyu Han, aren't you good at imitating others?

1116
00:41:12,464 --> 00:41:14,794
- I can mimic Lee Bum Soo. - Lee Bum Soo?

1117
00:41:14,864 --> 00:41:17,164
- Shall I do it? - Please do.

1118
00:41:17,164 --> 00:41:18,894
- It's been a long time. - I've never seen him do it.

1119
00:41:19,194 --> 00:41:22,934
(Bum Soo's spirit is possessing Kyu Han.)

1120
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,464
He sounds just like him.

1121
00:41:25,464 --> 00:41:27,434
Do you know how much you've done wrong?

1122
00:41:27,434 --> 00:41:28,934
(He's quite good.)

1123
00:41:29,064 --> 00:41:30,994
Se Chan, is there anything you can do?

1124
00:41:31,394 --> 00:41:35,764
I can sing "Don't Worry" by Jeon In Kwon...

1125
00:41:35,764 --> 00:41:37,894
- with a shaky, nasal voice. - Okay.

1126
00:41:39,324 --> 00:41:41,394
(Will he be possessed by the spirit?)

1127
00:41:46,294 --> 00:41:48,024
(My dear)

1128
00:41:48,024 --> 00:41:52,464
(Don't worry about anything)

1129
00:41:53,434 --> 00:41:55,364
(Let's)

1130
00:41:55,364 --> 00:41:59,194
(Sing together)

1131
00:41:59,624 --> 00:42:01,464
He tried so hard to come up with this.

1132
00:42:01,464 --> 00:42:05,824
(Bury all the painful memories)

1133
00:42:07,864 --> 00:42:12,364
(This proves that he's a comedian.)

1134
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:14,224
- He's good. - He's good.

1135
00:42:14,494 --> 00:42:16,434
He's definitely a comedian.

1136
00:42:16,764 --> 00:42:17,764
(He takes a big bite.)

1137
00:42:18,764 --> 00:42:19,934
(Everyone is hydrating.)

1138
00:42:19,934 --> 00:42:22,194
- It's an ointment. - It's a bug repellent.

1139
00:42:22,194 --> 00:42:23,764
Let's see.

1140
00:42:24,564 --> 00:42:26,394
Isn't watermelon interesting?

1141
00:42:26,664 --> 00:42:30,124
- Why? - I want to urinate right away.

1142
00:42:30,124 --> 00:42:31,124
I want to go to the bathroom.

1143
00:42:31,124 --> 00:42:32,664
It's because it has a lot of water.

1144
00:42:32,964 --> 00:42:34,964
I cross my legs without being conscious about it.

1145
00:42:35,824 --> 00:42:38,994
I'm not kidding. I can feel it right away.

1146
00:42:39,194 --> 00:42:41,624
Don't you need to use the restroom?

1147
00:42:41,964 --> 00:42:43,594
I bet you feel it by now.

1148
00:42:44,024 --> 00:42:45,824
- Just hold it. - Go through our land.

1149
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:47,294
(Their bladders are slowly filling up.)

1150
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,024
Can you donate the restroom?

1151
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,124
(It's red almost everywhere.)

1152
00:42:51,364 --> 00:42:53,064
He drank the whole thing in one go.

1153
00:42:53,064 --> 00:42:55,224
Why did you drink it all by yourself instead of sharing it?

1154
00:42:55,464 --> 00:42:58,224
- Let's hold it. - Pay five R to use the restroom.

1155
00:42:58,324 --> 00:43:00,294
- We'll let you go for two R. - You should just go.

1156
00:43:00,294 --> 00:43:01,664
Just pay us two R.

1157
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:03,264
- Two R? Okay. - Yes, two R.

1158
00:43:03,264 --> 00:43:05,264
- Let's go right away. - Two R is really cheap.

1159
00:43:05,264 --> 00:43:07,064
(Let's sell the land.)

1160
00:43:07,064 --> 00:43:08,594
Two R is cheap, isn't it?

1161
00:43:11,194 --> 00:43:13,464
Gosh, what are you doing?

1162
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,324
(It's a mess in Green Team.)

1163
00:43:16,324 --> 00:43:17,594
What are you doing?

1164
00:43:17,594 --> 00:43:19,764
- We have to sell it. - We need money to attack.

1165
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,664
We need to sell these so people can't leave.

1166
00:43:21,664 --> 00:43:24,094
No one's leaving. Why do you keep saying that?

1167
00:43:24,364 --> 00:43:26,764
- We don't need this piece of land. - No, it's this area.

1168
00:43:26,764 --> 00:43:27,824
(While holding their bladder, they're fighting over the land.)

1169
00:43:27,824 --> 00:43:29,024
(Are you ignoring my comment?)

1170
00:43:29,464 --> 00:43:31,224
That's what I mean.

1171
00:43:31,224 --> 00:43:32,224
(Kwang Soo pulls down their shorts.)

1172
00:43:33,764 --> 00:43:35,624
(Se Chan takes revenge.)

1173
00:43:36,564 --> 00:43:37,864
They're too precarious.

1174
00:43:37,864 --> 00:43:41,124
(Due to conflicting opinions, they become more violent.)

1175
00:43:44,264 --> 00:43:49,424
(Things are getting worse among Green Team members.)

1176
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,564
(Who cares about having shorts when they have no R money?)

1177
00:43:52,564 --> 00:43:53,764
- What are you doing? - Goodness.

1178
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:54,964
(Who cares about having shorts when they have no R money?)

1179
00:43:55,894 --> 00:43:56,924
Let's get it over with.

1180
00:43:57,124 --> 00:43:59,324
Let's sell all our land and give up.

1181
00:44:00,024 --> 00:44:01,694
(Laughing)

1182
00:44:02,164 --> 00:44:03,924
What's the point?

1183
00:44:03,924 --> 00:44:06,424
Who sells their land to use the restroom?

1184
00:44:06,594 --> 00:44:08,024
Just urinate in your pants.

1185
00:44:08,024 --> 00:44:09,964
(We should have bought diapers.)

1186
00:44:10,924 --> 00:44:11,924
(When Green Team's argument settles...)

1187
00:44:11,924 --> 00:44:14,494
Everyone, this land will develop into a golf course soon.

1188
00:44:14,494 --> 00:44:16,564
- What's that sound? - What's that?

1189
00:44:17,064 --> 00:44:18,664
- You can eat it. - You eat it.

1190
00:44:18,664 --> 00:44:19,964
"Your land is my land."

1191
00:44:19,964 --> 00:44:21,564
(What is it this time?)

1192
00:44:21,564 --> 00:44:23,594
(Your land is my land.)

1193
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:24,594
What?

1194
00:44:25,594 --> 00:44:27,294
Here comes our chance.

1195
00:44:27,294 --> 00:44:29,164
- Here it is. - It's finally here.

1196
00:44:29,424 --> 00:44:32,194
We'll start conquer lands competition.

1197
00:44:32,594 --> 00:44:35,164
(A set of three games chosen at random)

1198
00:44:36,124 --> 00:44:37,864
All of these games are difficult.

1199
00:44:37,864 --> 00:44:40,494
"Electric Roulette" looks fun.

1200
00:44:40,494 --> 00:44:41,524
(The team that gets an electric shock loses.)

1201
00:44:41,524 --> 00:44:43,494
- This is it. - I've never seen it before.

1202
00:44:43,794 --> 00:44:44,894
Shall we start?

1203
00:44:45,364 --> 00:44:47,824
Two members from Red Team and Blue Team, step forward.

1204
00:44:47,824 --> 00:44:49,764
- How about you two? - Do you want to play first?

1205
00:44:49,764 --> 00:44:51,764
Get ready, set, go.

1206
00:44:51,764 --> 00:44:54,564
(The winning team takes land that's worth 30 R from the losing team.)

1207
00:44:54,564 --> 00:44:55,764
You should turn.

1208
00:44:55,764 --> 00:44:59,664
(The winning team takes land that's worth 30 R from the losing team.)

1209
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:01,424
(Dancing in excitement)

1210
00:45:02,294 --> 00:45:04,564
(The team with the last man standing wins.)

1211
00:45:05,464 --> 00:45:09,064
(Who will feel the electric shock?)

1212
00:45:09,064 --> 00:45:10,794
Wait a little longer.

1213
00:45:10,794 --> 00:45:12,824
- Avoid getting the shock. - Blow the whistle, please.

1214
00:45:14,194 --> 00:45:15,794
How strong is it?

1215
00:45:16,194 --> 00:45:17,694
How strong is the electric shock?

1216
00:45:17,694 --> 00:45:18,764
(Their hearts are pounding.)

1217
00:45:18,764 --> 00:45:20,424
- Everyone, be quiet. - Please.

1218
00:45:20,424 --> 00:45:22,324
- Please. - Who will it be?

1219
00:45:22,664 --> 00:45:24,364
Goodness.

1220
00:45:24,364 --> 00:45:27,494
(Waiting for the pain is scarier than losing all the land.)

1221
00:45:27,494 --> 00:45:30,294
Please, please.

1222
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:32,524
I'll work hard. Please help me.

1223
00:45:32,524 --> 00:45:33,564
(Which one will get unlucky?)

1224
00:45:33,924 --> 00:45:36,024
I'll do my best. Please.

1225
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,224
(Electric shock)

1226
00:45:38,964 --> 00:45:42,294
(Gary gets shocked.)

1227
00:45:42,694 --> 00:45:43,764
This isn't easy.

1228
00:45:43,764 --> 00:45:44,864
(It's more exhilarating to watch someone in pain.)

1229
00:45:45,094 --> 00:45:47,324
- We won. - We won!

1230
00:45:47,694 --> 00:45:49,764
Gosh, it really hurt.

1231
00:45:49,764 --> 00:45:51,564
Are you kidding?

1232
00:45:51,564 --> 00:45:52,964
You should endure the pain.

1233
00:45:52,964 --> 00:45:55,264
I felt it all the way to my heart.

1234
00:45:55,264 --> 00:45:57,464
- Goodness. - Gary got unlucky.

1235
00:45:57,464 --> 00:45:59,264
(The electric shock is terrifying.)

1236
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:01,494
(Haha gets shocked.)

1237
00:46:01,494 --> 00:46:02,724
It hurts.

1238
00:46:02,824 --> 00:46:05,924
(Gosh, it's very painful.)

1239
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,264
- The shock must be strong. - Goodness.

1240
00:46:08,264 --> 00:46:09,424
Keep calm.

1241
00:46:09,424 --> 00:46:11,394
(It's Jae Seok versus Kyu Han.)

1242
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:13,024
- It started. - Endure the pain.

1243
00:46:13,464 --> 00:46:14,664
The shock will be very strong.

1244
00:46:14,764 --> 00:46:15,964
It's level four.

1245
00:46:15,964 --> 00:46:18,764
It's level four, the highest level.

1246
00:46:19,124 --> 00:46:21,394
Please, endure the pain, Kyu Han.

1247
00:46:21,394 --> 00:46:23,924
(Whoever avoids the shock can take three blocks of land.)

1248
00:46:24,264 --> 00:46:31,124
(Which of them will get the electric shock?)

1249
00:46:34,394 --> 00:46:37,464
(Kyu Han loses.)

1250
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:40,794
(Blue Team wins three blocks of land.)

1251
00:46:40,794 --> 00:46:42,794
That was great.

1252
00:46:43,294 --> 00:46:46,494
It feels like I've been bitten by a snake.

1253
00:46:47,094 --> 00:46:48,924
This isn't the kind of pain you can endure.

1254
00:46:48,924 --> 00:46:51,164
(We'll take back our land no matter what.)

1255
00:46:53,324 --> 00:46:55,324
- Kwang Soo, you have long arms. - Is this "Draw a Mole"?

1256
00:46:55,324 --> 00:46:56,324
What is this game?

1257
00:46:56,324 --> 00:46:59,664
One of the markers doesn't write as it's out of ink.

1258
00:46:59,664 --> 00:47:01,924
Okay, do we draw a mole however we'd like?

1259
00:47:01,924 --> 00:47:03,664
- It's up to you. - Okay.

1260
00:47:03,964 --> 00:47:04,964
One.

1261
00:47:04,964 --> 00:47:07,494
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1262
00:47:07,494 --> 00:47:08,494
(Kwang Soo versus Jae Seok)

1263
00:47:08,494 --> 00:47:11,664
(It's an unfortunate fight they can't avoid.)

1264
00:47:11,664 --> 00:47:12,664
Draw it.

1265
00:47:13,524 --> 00:47:14,524
Let's go.

1266
00:47:16,164 --> 00:47:18,064
Draw one on this side.

1267
00:47:18,064 --> 00:47:19,364
(Which one is the unlucky one?)

1268
00:47:19,364 --> 00:47:20,424
Make it big.

1269
00:47:20,424 --> 00:47:21,464
(Which one is the unlucky one?)

1270
00:47:23,894 --> 00:47:25,564
(Oh, I'm the unlucky one.)

1271
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:27,764
Jae Seok's marker is working.

1272
00:47:27,824 --> 00:47:28,824
(Shaking)

1273
00:47:32,264 --> 00:47:36,664
(No matter how much he shakes it, there's no ink in the marker.)

1274
00:47:36,664 --> 00:47:39,224
Kwang Soo, try blowing air on the marker.

1275
00:47:40,094 --> 00:47:41,224
(He blows hot air.)

1276
00:47:42,594 --> 00:47:43,824
Poor Kwang Soo.

1277
00:47:43,824 --> 00:47:46,694
(The marker doesn't write.)

1278
00:47:46,694 --> 00:47:50,364
Gosh, Red Team is so lucky.

1279
00:47:50,364 --> 00:47:52,594
(Kwang Soo, the unlucky one)

1280
00:47:52,594 --> 00:47:53,664
Hey.

1281
00:47:54,064 --> 00:47:55,394
Just back away.

1282
00:47:55,464 --> 00:47:56,964
Is Sol Bin next?

1283
00:47:56,964 --> 00:47:58,564
It's Sol Bin.

1284
00:47:58,564 --> 00:48:00,394
Gary will play next.

1285
00:48:00,394 --> 00:48:01,394
(Sol Bin versus Gary)

1286
00:48:01,394 --> 00:48:02,424
(A girl group member's face is on the line.)

1287
00:48:02,424 --> 00:48:04,694
- Let's start. - Goodness.

1288
00:48:05,524 --> 00:48:07,894
- In 1, 2, 3. - Turn around.

1289
00:48:08,194 --> 00:48:10,924
- Do it now. - Go.

1290
00:48:10,924 --> 00:48:15,394
(Which one is the unlucky one?)

1291
00:48:21,024 --> 00:48:22,764
(Screaming)

1292
00:48:22,764 --> 00:48:24,664
(Sol Bin is an unlucky idol.)

1293
00:48:24,664 --> 00:48:27,064
She's an idol.

1294
00:48:28,094 --> 00:48:29,994
Don't ruin her face.

1295
00:48:29,994 --> 00:48:31,394
Gary, make a unibrow.

1296
00:48:31,394 --> 00:48:33,694
- Make a unibrow. - She's an idol.

1297
00:48:33,694 --> 00:48:36,094
- That looks beautiful. - Oh, no.

1298
00:48:36,764 --> 00:48:38,524
- Look at my face. - That was great.

1299
00:48:38,524 --> 00:48:40,024
Red Team is so lucky.

1300
00:48:40,094 --> 00:48:41,494
We'll go next.

1301
00:48:41,494 --> 00:48:43,364
(We have to stop Red Team somehow.)

1302
00:48:44,064 --> 00:48:46,264
Let's play a different game.

1303
00:48:46,264 --> 00:48:47,364
Sounds good.

1304
00:48:47,494 --> 00:48:49,524
Who's going to play?

1305
00:48:49,524 --> 00:48:50,794
(It's Se Chan, Soo Hong, Na Rae and Sol Bin against each other.)

1306
00:48:50,824 --> 00:48:51,824
- You have to do it. - You're up, Se Chan.

1307
00:48:51,824 --> 00:48:52,994
There's no other choice.

1308
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:54,364
- Do you want to go, Soo Hong? - Got it?

1309
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:56,264
- You can do this. - You're up, Se Chan.

1310
00:48:56,524 --> 00:48:58,394
- Let's go! - I think she's quite unlucky.

1311
00:49:01,094 --> 00:49:03,094
(The person who pops up the pirate wins.)

1312
00:49:03,094 --> 00:49:04,164
No pressure.

1313
00:49:04,164 --> 00:49:06,094
- You can do this. - You're on fire right now.

1314
00:49:06,094 --> 00:49:07,924
You got this.

1315
00:49:07,924 --> 00:49:10,394
- You can do this. - Look at her dance.

1316
00:49:10,464 --> 00:49:12,164
I have a good feeling about this.

1317
00:49:12,164 --> 00:49:13,364
I hope it pops up.

1318
00:49:13,364 --> 00:49:14,394
Nice.

1319
00:49:15,124 --> 00:49:16,194
Good job.

1320
00:49:16,724 --> 00:49:18,494
You can do it, Na Rae.

1321
00:49:18,494 --> 00:49:20,024
No pressure.

1322
00:49:20,024 --> 00:49:21,694
(Na Rae and Sol Bin avoid the spot.)

1323
00:49:21,694 --> 00:49:23,194
You have to make it pop up.

1324
00:49:26,224 --> 00:49:27,294
(He makes a loud noise.)

1325
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:30,364
- Why'd you do that? - You scared me.

1326
00:49:30,494 --> 00:49:31,724
Bring me the hammer.

1327
00:49:31,724 --> 00:49:33,524
It was a mistake.

1328
00:49:34,724 --> 00:49:35,994
We have a long way to go.

1329
00:49:35,994 --> 00:49:37,824
(She's concentrating.)

1330
00:49:37,824 --> 00:49:40,124
It will pop up this time.

1331
00:49:41,424 --> 00:49:43,294
You're doing good, Sol Bin. That's the right spot.

1332
00:49:43,294 --> 00:49:45,824
(The pirate isn't coming out the barrel any time soon.)

1333
00:49:46,424 --> 00:49:47,464
Mind your face.

1334
00:49:50,294 --> 00:49:51,494
Take it slow.

1335
00:49:51,594 --> 00:49:54,364
(He's taking it slow.)

1336
00:49:55,794 --> 00:49:57,224
- This is it. - No, it's not.

1337
00:49:57,224 --> 00:49:58,294
Which one do you think it is, Kwang Soo?

1338
00:49:58,324 --> 00:49:59,564
This game is always nerve-racking to play.

1339
00:49:59,564 --> 00:50:00,724
Is it this one?

1340
00:50:00,724 --> 00:50:02,024
I'm getting nervous.

1341
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,794
(Se Chan wins.)

1342
00:50:08,794 --> 00:50:10,194
Did you see that?

1343
00:50:10,194 --> 00:50:12,394
Do you know what Kwang Soo said?

1344
00:50:12,394 --> 00:50:14,624
"It's the one below the green one."

1345
00:50:14,624 --> 00:50:15,694
(How did Kwang Soo know that?)

1346
00:50:15,694 --> 00:50:16,864
How'd you know that?

1347
00:50:16,964 --> 00:50:18,524
That was amazing.

1348
00:50:19,294 --> 00:50:20,624
There's still a long way to go.

1349
00:50:21,164 --> 00:50:22,194
It's this one.

1350
00:50:23,164 --> 00:50:24,964
(Kwang Soo says it's the one below the green knife.)

1351
00:50:24,994 --> 00:50:27,194
- It's that one. - Mind your face.

1352
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:28,894
- That one? - Yes.

1353
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:33,424
(Kwang Soo has a way of knowing these things.)

1354
00:50:33,424 --> 00:50:34,764
That was amazing.

1355
00:50:34,764 --> 00:50:36,894
How'd you know that?

1356
00:50:37,424 --> 00:50:39,394
He's got the instinct.

1357
00:50:39,394 --> 00:50:41,664
- That was amazing. - He was born unlucky.

1358
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:43,764
No, I wasn't.

1359
00:50:43,764 --> 00:50:46,094
(Thanks, Mr Pirate.)

1360
00:50:47,124 --> 00:50:49,894
You should buy as much land as you can with the money you have.

1361
00:50:49,894 --> 00:50:52,694
You need as much land you can get for the last mission.

1362
00:50:52,694 --> 00:50:55,694
At the same time, you don't have to spend all your R money.

1363
00:50:55,694 --> 00:50:57,424
You will still need it later.

1364
00:50:57,524 --> 00:50:58,964
If you don't have enough R money, you'll have to sell your land.

1365
00:50:58,964 --> 00:50:59,994
How should we do this?

1366
00:50:59,994 --> 00:51:01,724
Should we spend all our money?

1367
00:51:01,724 --> 00:51:03,394
Let's not spend too much money.

1368
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:04,864
Let's get this one.

1369
00:51:04,864 --> 00:51:06,594
Should we buy all of them except for the ones that cost 20 R?

1370
00:51:06,594 --> 00:51:08,564
- Sounds good. - Let's do that.

1371
00:51:14,024 --> 00:51:15,664
- What's this? - Are we playing another game?

1372
00:51:15,664 --> 00:51:16,964
What do we do now?

1373
00:51:17,424 --> 00:51:19,024
- Do you hear that? - What's that?

1374
00:51:19,024 --> 00:51:20,624
There's been a theft?

1375
00:51:20,624 --> 00:51:21,624
What's that supposed to mean?

1376
00:51:22,294 --> 00:51:23,494
Did someone steal something?

1377
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:25,364
Is there a spy among us?

1378
00:51:25,364 --> 00:51:26,424
- What's going on? - There's been a theft.

1379
00:51:26,424 --> 00:51:28,194
"Your suitcases have been stolen."

1380
00:51:28,664 --> 00:51:31,664
"We've been informed that they're in Heyri. Please hurry."

1381
00:51:31,664 --> 00:51:33,094
Are we going to Heyri?

1382
00:51:33,464 --> 00:51:35,464
Let's go.

1383
00:51:35,464 --> 00:51:37,224
(What's waiting for them in Heyri?)

1384
00:51:40,524 --> 00:51:42,124
Here in this town of Heyri,

1385
00:51:42,124 --> 00:51:44,064
your suitcases are hidden somewhere.

1386
00:51:44,064 --> 00:51:46,594
If you successfully carry out the mission here,

1387
00:51:46,594 --> 00:51:48,524
you'll be able to get your suitcases back.

1388
00:51:48,524 --> 00:51:49,594
("Find Your Luggage")

1389
00:51:49,694 --> 00:51:52,524
(Carry out the team mission to receive R money and suitcases.)

1390
00:51:52,524 --> 00:51:54,024
What's the mission?

1391
00:51:54,024 --> 00:51:55,524
(Succeed the team mission and you'll be given R money and suitcases.)

1392
00:51:55,524 --> 00:51:57,864
(What missions will the teams have to carry out?)

1393
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:00,394
"Act out accordingly to a given word together with a citizen."

1394
00:52:00,394 --> 00:52:03,564
"If all of you get it right, the mission is successful."

1395
00:52:03,564 --> 00:52:06,964
If you come back with a name tag after you finish the mission,

1396
00:52:06,964 --> 00:52:08,194
you'll get your suitcases back...

1397
00:52:08,194 --> 00:52:09,824
and receive some R money.

1398
00:52:10,364 --> 00:52:15,324
(Each team has a different mission.)

1399
00:52:15,464 --> 00:52:17,024
Take a look.

1400
00:52:17,024 --> 00:52:19,064
Tell me if you spot the place in the picture.

1401
00:52:20,324 --> 00:52:21,564
Are those stairs?

1402
00:52:21,564 --> 00:52:24,794
Tell me if you see a statue of a dog.

1403
00:52:24,824 --> 00:52:28,724
Where is this place in the picture? This is confusing.

1404
00:52:29,464 --> 00:52:31,194
There's someone over there.

1405
00:52:31,524 --> 00:52:32,624
Here she comes.

1406
00:52:32,664 --> 00:52:34,294
Hello.

1407
00:52:34,294 --> 00:52:36,724
Can you help us with a mission?

1408
00:52:37,194 --> 00:52:40,894
Ready, set, go!

1409
00:52:40,894 --> 00:52:41,964
(Jumping)

1410
00:52:41,964 --> 00:52:43,324
Gary.

1411
00:52:43,624 --> 00:52:44,694
Gary.

1412
00:52:45,024 --> 00:52:46,424
(They look exactly the same.)

1413
00:52:47,524 --> 00:52:49,124
Jumping.

1414
00:52:49,964 --> 00:52:51,494
Jumping.

1415
00:52:52,094 --> 00:52:53,164
Okay.

1416
00:52:54,364 --> 00:52:56,064
Hopping.

1417
00:52:56,564 --> 00:52:58,294
Hopping.

1418
00:52:58,294 --> 00:53:00,394
Hopping.

1419
00:53:00,964 --> 00:53:02,264
Jumping.

1420
00:53:02,494 --> 00:53:04,164
Popping.

1421
00:53:04,394 --> 00:53:06,124
Popping.

1422
00:53:06,564 --> 00:53:08,794
(They failed the first one.)

1423
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,694
- Is that right? - No.

1424
00:53:11,924 --> 00:53:13,894
Gary.

1425
00:53:13,894 --> 00:53:15,124
(Coughing)

1426
00:53:15,124 --> 00:53:16,924
Coughing.

1427
00:53:17,094 --> 00:53:18,494
Coughing.

1428
00:53:18,694 --> 00:53:20,194
Coughing.

1429
00:53:20,194 --> 00:53:21,324
Hey.

1430
00:53:22,124 --> 00:53:23,764
Clock, clock.

1431
00:53:24,094 --> 00:53:25,564
Clock, clock.

1432
00:53:25,824 --> 00:53:28,094
Clock, clock.

1433
00:53:29,494 --> 00:53:31,264
Club, club.

1434
00:53:31,694 --> 00:53:33,364
Club, club.

1435
00:53:34,064 --> 00:53:35,464
Club, club.

1436
00:53:35,464 --> 00:53:37,664
Club.

1437
00:53:37,664 --> 00:53:39,594
- Club, club. - That's not it.

1438
00:53:39,594 --> 00:53:41,624
Club, club.

1439
00:53:41,764 --> 00:53:43,664
- Did you get it? - That's not it.

1440
00:53:43,764 --> 00:53:45,024
Did you get that?

1441
00:53:45,964 --> 00:53:49,064
(They're looking for a person wearing green.)

1442
00:53:49,094 --> 00:53:50,524
Isn't that green?

1443
00:53:50,524 --> 00:53:52,524
- She's wearing green. - Hey, little girl.

1444
00:53:52,524 --> 00:53:54,524
- She's wearing green. - Do you know who we are?

1445
00:53:54,794 --> 00:53:57,364
Don't you know Kwang Soo from Running Man?

1446
00:53:57,394 --> 00:53:59,624
- Hello. - You know him, right?

1447
00:54:02,824 --> 00:54:05,564
(I've been looking for you.)

1448
00:54:05,564 --> 00:54:07,224
(They're very close to succeeding the mission.)

1449
00:54:07,224 --> 00:54:09,194
- Hello. - You know him, right?

1450
00:54:09,464 --> 00:54:10,794
(She runs away.)

1451
00:54:10,794 --> 00:54:11,864
Where are you going?

1452
00:54:12,394 --> 00:54:14,294
- Let me give you an autograph. - He'll give you an autograph.

1453
00:54:14,294 --> 00:54:15,964
- I want to give you my autograph. - He'll give you his autograph.

1454
00:54:16,124 --> 00:54:17,824
Kwang Soo wants to give you his autograph.

1455
00:54:17,824 --> 00:54:18,864
Don't you want my autograph?

1456
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:20,764
Oh, you don't want it?

1457
00:54:21,194 --> 00:54:23,594
Don't you want to get his autograph?

1458
00:54:23,824 --> 00:54:25,924
- You don't want it? - It might not be valuable now,

1459
00:54:25,924 --> 00:54:27,524
but it'll be of great value in the future.

1460
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:30,364
I don't want it. I'm going.

1461
00:54:30,964 --> 00:54:33,324
(They get denied.)

1462
00:54:33,964 --> 00:54:35,194
(This is hilarious.)

1463
00:54:35,194 --> 00:54:37,324
Fine, then.

1464
00:54:37,324 --> 00:54:39,324
- Goodbye. - You really don't want it?

1465
00:54:39,324 --> 00:54:40,624
Are you sure?

1466
00:54:41,294 --> 00:54:42,964
We have to find someone else.

1467
00:54:43,194 --> 00:54:44,664
Why doesn't she want your autograph?

1468
00:54:44,664 --> 00:54:46,024
I thought you were better than this.

1469
00:54:46,024 --> 00:54:47,964
Why are kids these days so stubborn?

1470
00:54:48,524 --> 00:54:50,494
(Green Team fails their first attempt.)

1471
00:54:52,564 --> 00:54:54,224
I can hear them.

1472
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:56,724
- They're over there. - Hold up, Na Rae.

1473
00:54:56,894 --> 00:54:58,364
Don't rush it.

1474
00:54:58,494 --> 00:55:00,524
Jumping.

1475
00:55:00,524 --> 00:55:02,124
Jumping.

1476
00:55:02,324 --> 00:55:04,964
Can someone help us with our mission?

1477
00:55:04,964 --> 00:55:06,764
- Can you help us? - Hanging.

1478
00:55:06,864 --> 00:55:08,764
Hanging.

1479
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:10,724
- Can you help us out? - Help us.

1480
00:55:12,364 --> 00:55:13,364
- Hanging. - We have a mission.

1481
00:55:13,364 --> 00:55:15,164
What are you doing?

1482
00:55:15,524 --> 00:55:16,724
What do you think you're doing?

1483
00:55:17,294 --> 00:55:19,464
Thank you.

1484
00:55:19,464 --> 00:55:20,724
Thank you.

1485
00:55:21,364 --> 00:55:23,894
Let's go.

1486
00:55:24,694 --> 00:55:26,394
Baseball. One, two, three.

1487
00:55:26,924 --> 00:55:27,994
Three.

1488
00:55:28,564 --> 00:55:29,564
Mission success.

1489
00:55:30,294 --> 00:55:32,324
We did it.

1490
00:55:32,724 --> 00:55:34,294
That was easy.

1491
00:55:34,294 --> 00:55:35,964
You will be given...

1492
00:55:35,964 --> 00:55:38,824
your suitcases and 50 R.

1493
00:55:38,824 --> 00:55:40,464
(Orange Team claims their prize.)

1494
00:55:41,424 --> 00:55:43,294
Walking.

1495
00:55:43,524 --> 00:55:44,594
Hey.

1496
00:55:45,624 --> 00:55:47,664
Walking.

1497
00:55:47,694 --> 00:55:49,194
Walking.

1498
00:55:49,324 --> 00:55:51,024
Walking.

1499
00:55:51,164 --> 00:55:52,964
Walking.

1500
00:55:52,964 --> 00:55:54,824
Okay.

1501
00:55:56,764 --> 00:56:00,294
(Red Team succeeds their mission.)

1502
00:56:00,294 --> 00:56:01,624
Nice.

1503
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:02,794
That was hard.

1504
00:56:03,094 --> 00:56:04,294
Can we take this off now?

1505
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:06,124
I'm drooling all over the place.

1506
00:56:06,494 --> 00:56:08,364
This is harsh.

1507
00:56:10,464 --> 00:56:12,324
Two teams succeeded their missions already?

1508
00:56:12,324 --> 00:56:14,594
- Two teams? - We have to watch out for them.

1509
00:56:14,594 --> 00:56:16,394
- There she is again. - Hello.

1510
00:56:16,394 --> 00:56:17,464
Did you change your mind?

1511
00:56:17,464 --> 00:56:19,224
- Did you change your mind? - Do you want my autograph?

1512
00:56:19,524 --> 00:56:20,564
No?

1513
00:56:20,864 --> 00:56:22,594
Okay.

1514
00:56:22,594 --> 00:56:24,494
- We're not forcing you. - Don't you like Kwang Soo?

1515
00:56:24,494 --> 00:56:26,424
- Are you wearing green? - He's too tall, isn't he?

1516
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:28,164
What are you doing?

1517
00:56:28,164 --> 00:56:29,464
She doesn't like you at all.

1518
00:56:29,464 --> 00:56:30,664
Let's get his autograph.

1519
00:56:31,294 --> 00:56:32,724
(I don't want it.)

1520
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:35,224
We really want to give you an autograph.

1521
00:56:35,264 --> 00:56:37,264
Can you just let us sign something?

1522
00:56:37,264 --> 00:56:39,024
Anywhere you want.

1523
00:56:39,024 --> 00:56:40,064
She's not wearing green.

1524
00:56:40,094 --> 00:56:42,324
Please, I'm begging you.

1525
00:56:43,194 --> 00:56:44,994
- Ji Soo. - I don't want to.

1526
00:56:44,994 --> 00:56:46,094
Let's get an autograph on your trousers.

1527
00:56:46,094 --> 00:56:47,424
- Let's do it. - Don't you want it?

1528
00:56:47,424 --> 00:56:48,894
Do you want my autograph?

1529
00:56:49,124 --> 00:56:51,324
- No? Okay. - We're sorry.

1530
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,064
- We'll go. - Thanks anyway.

1531
00:56:53,424 --> 00:56:55,194
I'm going to work harder from now on.

1532
00:56:55,624 --> 00:56:57,694
Kwang Soo, I thought kids loved you.

1533
00:56:57,864 --> 00:56:59,664
- How old are you, by the way? - Stop it.

1534
00:56:59,894 --> 00:57:01,664
I don't get it.

1535
00:57:01,664 --> 00:57:02,794
Get over it.

1536
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,124
Kids her age are supposed to like me.

1537
00:57:06,564 --> 00:57:09,564
Am I supposed to take off their name tags like Running Man?

1538
00:57:09,564 --> 00:57:10,964
This is Running Man.

1539
00:57:10,964 --> 00:57:12,294
Oh, right.

1540
00:57:12,464 --> 00:57:13,864
The other team can't take our name tags off.

1541
00:57:13,864 --> 00:57:15,394
(Red Team needs a name tag to claim their prize.)

1542
00:57:15,394 --> 00:57:17,024
I wonder where they are.

1543
00:57:18,824 --> 00:57:20,864
- Who should we go for? - Make up your mind.

1544
00:57:20,864 --> 00:57:23,064
- Did you do your mission? - Not yet.

1545
00:57:23,294 --> 00:57:24,594
- Come here, Seok Jin. - Why?

1546
00:57:25,994 --> 00:57:27,024
(Is Green Team attacking?)

1547
00:57:27,024 --> 00:57:28,164
Get the name tag!

1548
00:57:28,164 --> 00:57:30,164
- Come here, Seok Jin. - Get the name tag!

1549
00:57:30,394 --> 00:57:31,864
Hold on.

1550
00:57:32,364 --> 00:57:33,494
(Green Team succeeded their mission before running into Red Team.)

1551
00:57:33,494 --> 00:57:35,324
I think they did their mission.

1552
00:57:35,324 --> 00:57:37,224
- No, we haven't. - Let's go after other teams.

1553
00:57:37,224 --> 00:57:38,824
- Sounds good. - Let's not waste our energy.

1554
00:57:38,824 --> 00:57:40,864
Did you see where the other teams went?

1555
00:57:40,864 --> 00:57:41,924
No.

1556
00:57:41,924 --> 00:57:45,224
(The truce is broken after 10 seconds.)

1557
00:57:46,624 --> 00:57:47,694
Run!

1558
00:57:49,764 --> 00:57:51,064
Take it off.

1559
00:57:51,264 --> 00:57:52,624
Take it off, Soo Hong.

1560
00:57:54,964 --> 00:57:56,194
Take it off, Soo Hong.

1561
00:57:56,664 --> 00:57:57,924
I got it!

1562
00:57:57,924 --> 00:57:59,624
- I got it! - Nice.

1563
00:58:01,324 --> 00:58:03,094
- I got attacked. - Is this it?

1564
00:58:03,164 --> 00:58:05,124
- Good job. - What happened?

1565
00:58:05,124 --> 00:58:06,764
(Red Team got their suitcases back and were given 30 R.)

1566
00:58:06,924 --> 00:58:08,194
We have to go for Blue Team.

1567
00:58:08,194 --> 00:58:10,194
What's going on right now?

1568
00:58:10,394 --> 00:58:12,394
We have to go for Blue Team.

1569
00:58:13,024 --> 00:58:14,124
They're over there.

1570
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:16,424
Why isn't anyone wearing green?

1571
00:58:16,424 --> 00:58:18,464
Why isn't anyone wearing green?

1572
00:58:20,294 --> 00:58:23,664
(Green Team decides to attack...)

1573
00:58:23,664 --> 00:58:25,794
(Sol Bin while her team is idle.)

1574
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:27,064
Sol Bin, come here.

1575
00:58:27,764 --> 00:58:28,864
Sol Bin, come here.

1576
00:58:32,364 --> 00:58:33,524
I got it.

1577
00:58:33,724 --> 00:58:35,064
(Green Team successfully tears off the name tag.)

1578
00:58:35,064 --> 00:58:36,794
- I tore it. - He did it.

1579
00:58:36,794 --> 00:58:39,224
(Green Team obtains their luggage and 10 R.)

1580
00:58:39,264 --> 00:58:40,524
We didn't have much time.

1581
00:58:41,124 --> 00:58:42,224
It was very difficult.

1582
00:58:42,224 --> 00:58:46,494
Since you came in last, take the luggage without any R money.

1583
00:58:46,694 --> 00:58:48,764
- Okay. - I won't take the luggage, either.

1584
00:58:50,464 --> 00:58:51,794
How disappointing.

1585
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:53,824
(What awaits them in the house?)

1586
00:58:54,694 --> 00:58:56,924
(The second half of No Way Out Race begins.)

1587
00:58:58,694 --> 00:59:00,224
(Escape with your luggage.)

1588
00:59:00,224 --> 00:59:03,364
All of you found your luggage.

1589
00:59:03,594 --> 00:59:06,994
The second half of No Way Out Race is "Running Marble".

1590
00:59:07,224 --> 00:59:08,794
- The second half? - It's "Running Marble".

1591
00:59:08,794 --> 00:59:09,824
Wow.

1592
00:59:11,694 --> 00:59:14,824
The luggage lock combinations are hidden under the lands.

1593
00:59:15,924 --> 00:59:18,724
Your lock combinations are hidden under other teams' lands.

1594
00:59:18,724 --> 00:59:21,024
Therefore, the team with the most land has an advantage.

1595
00:59:22,064 --> 00:59:26,064
If you get someone else's combination, place an R mark.

1596
00:59:26,394 --> 00:59:30,594
If you find your lock combination, return the land as you found it.

1597
00:59:31,294 --> 00:59:34,064
The team to find two lock combinations first wins.

1598
00:59:34,124 --> 00:59:37,264
A terrible punishment awaits the team that comes in last.

1599
00:59:37,394 --> 00:59:39,024
We need to control our facial expressions.

1600
00:59:39,024 --> 00:59:41,664
You can't express your emotions too much.

1601
00:59:41,764 --> 00:59:42,994
Let's not control our facial expressions.

1602
00:59:42,994 --> 00:59:45,524
(A terrible punishment awaits the team that comes in last.)

1603
00:59:45,564 --> 00:59:47,064
The team to find first wins.

1604
00:59:47,064 --> 00:59:48,124
Okay.

1605
00:59:48,124 --> 00:59:49,624
(Kyu Han keeps a poker face.)

1606
00:59:49,724 --> 00:59:50,924
I'll roll it.

1607
00:59:50,924 --> 00:59:52,194
- Let's start. - Go.

1608
00:59:52,194 --> 00:59:53,264
(Orange Team goes first.)

1609
00:59:55,524 --> 00:59:57,264
It's two.

1610
00:59:58,064 --> 01:00:01,294
(I wish it were a bigger number.)

1611
01:00:01,394 --> 01:00:02,894
Which ones should we flip?

1612
01:00:03,124 --> 01:00:04,964
- Let's flip 20 and 27. - Okay.

1613
01:00:04,994 --> 01:00:06,364
(They choose Green Team's 27.)

1614
01:00:06,364 --> 01:00:07,364
Flip 20 and 27.

1615
01:00:07,364 --> 01:00:09,764
Why are you flipping ours?

1616
01:00:09,764 --> 01:00:12,394
- Flip Red Team's land. - Other teams can't watch.

1617
01:00:12,624 --> 01:00:14,694
(There's nothing under Green Team's 27.)

1618
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:15,764
Let's see.

1619
01:00:15,764 --> 01:00:17,624
(There is nothing.)

1620
01:00:17,924 --> 01:00:19,664
(We're off to a bad start.)

1621
01:00:20,064 --> 01:00:21,494
(He's happy that they got nothing.)

1622
01:00:21,494 --> 01:00:22,894
I'll roll the die.

1623
01:00:23,164 --> 01:00:24,264
Please.

1624
01:00:24,264 --> 01:00:25,994
- Let it be six. - Six.

1625
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:28,364
- Let it be six. - Six.

1626
01:00:28,364 --> 01:00:31,224
(It's exactly like Soo Hong called it.)

1627
01:00:31,924 --> 01:00:33,024
We're lucky today.

1628
01:00:33,024 --> 01:00:35,194
(Today is a lucky day for us.)

1629
01:00:35,524 --> 01:00:37,164
- How is this possible? - They're so lucky today.

1630
01:00:37,164 --> 01:00:38,994
Red Team is winning right now.

1631
01:00:39,624 --> 01:00:42,864
- Let's flip three here and there. - Okay.

1632
01:00:42,864 --> 01:00:45,294
(In the direction that Jae Seok is pointing,)

1633
01:00:45,294 --> 01:00:50,024
(Red Team's lock combinations are hidden in Green Team's land.)

1634
01:00:51,124 --> 01:00:53,894
(Red Team heads towards their lock combinations.)

1635
01:00:55,124 --> 01:00:58,594
(Will it be this easy on them?)

1636
01:01:00,664 --> 01:01:01,764
I'll be bold and choose one.

1637
01:01:01,764 --> 01:01:02,894
Be bold.

1638
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:06,424
(He gets nothing.)

1639
01:01:06,594 --> 01:01:08,664
(Their lock combination is under the block right next to it.)

1640
01:01:08,664 --> 01:01:09,764
There was nothing.

1641
01:01:09,764 --> 01:01:12,424
(They keep getting unlucky.)

1642
01:01:14,124 --> 01:01:17,394
(They get nothing again.)

1643
01:01:17,724 --> 01:01:19,524
Why do you keep staring at us?

1644
01:01:20,394 --> 01:01:24,564
(It's interesting how you continue to miss where the combinations are.)

1645
01:01:24,824 --> 01:01:26,994
Where could it be?

1646
01:01:28,024 --> 01:01:30,194
(They look under Blue Team's land but still get nothing.)

1647
01:01:30,994 --> 01:01:33,164
Let's flip three blocks of Blue Team's land.

1648
01:01:33,164 --> 01:01:34,724
Okay.

1649
01:01:35,364 --> 01:01:38,594
(They get nothing again.)

1650
01:01:38,664 --> 01:01:41,294
- You scolded me for expressing... - Don't we have to put it back?

1651
01:01:41,294 --> 01:01:43,024
disappointment, but why are you doing it?

1652
01:01:43,624 --> 01:01:45,464
(Getting 6 on the die was useless.)

1653
01:01:45,464 --> 01:01:46,824
They didn't find anything.

1654
01:01:49,094 --> 01:01:50,424
I bet it's here.

1655
01:01:51,424 --> 01:01:52,464
I found something.

1656
01:01:52,464 --> 01:01:53,694
Here it is.

1657
01:01:54,824 --> 01:01:57,194
(They find Orange Team's lock combination.)

1658
01:01:58,294 --> 01:01:59,294
It's Orange Team's.

1659
01:01:59,294 --> 01:02:01,724
(Be quiet.)

1660
01:02:02,424 --> 01:02:05,894
(If you find other team's combination, leave an R mark.)

1661
01:02:06,564 --> 01:02:08,564
Why are they looking through our land?

1662
01:02:08,564 --> 01:02:09,664
(Orange Team has no idea.)

1663
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:13,764
(We know your lock combination.)

1664
01:02:14,094 --> 01:02:15,594
- Let's go. - One.

1665
01:02:15,664 --> 01:02:16,994
- One. - That's good.

1666
01:02:17,594 --> 01:02:19,164
We got one.

1667
01:02:19,664 --> 01:02:22,094
- One. - That's good.

1668
01:02:22,964 --> 01:02:25,924
(He can't do that.)

1669
01:02:25,924 --> 01:02:28,124
I didn't do anything wrong.

1670
01:02:28,124 --> 01:02:30,064
What's wrong with you?

1671
01:02:30,064 --> 01:02:31,794
Things come true when you say them out loud.

1672
01:02:31,794 --> 01:02:35,294
- What's wrong with you? - What you say out loud comes true.

1673
01:02:35,294 --> 01:02:37,924
- That was incredible. - What you say out loud comes true.

1674
01:02:38,294 --> 01:02:40,024
Are you going to flip our land again?

1675
01:02:40,024 --> 01:02:41,024
(Green Team looks through Orange Team's land.)

1676
01:02:41,024 --> 01:02:43,424
- Why ours? - I'm being very careful.

1677
01:02:43,424 --> 01:02:45,264
I think it's better to get it over with.

1678
01:02:45,264 --> 01:02:47,064
Why are you in such a hurry?

1679
01:02:47,064 --> 01:02:49,164
Trust me just this once.

1680
01:02:49,164 --> 01:02:50,394
Are you going to flip it?

1681
01:02:51,264 --> 01:02:52,364
Are you going to flip it?

1682
01:02:52,364 --> 01:02:55,024
(Of course, they find nothing.)

1683
01:02:55,324 --> 01:02:57,364
(You told us to trust you.)

1684
01:02:58,294 --> 01:02:59,394
(They take his pants off.)

1685
01:03:00,094 --> 01:03:01,394
(Smacking)

1686
01:03:03,524 --> 01:03:05,294
Come here.

1687
01:03:05,294 --> 01:03:06,864
(I'm sorry for being unlucky.)

1688
01:03:07,024 --> 01:03:08,724
- One, one. - Let me do it.

1689
01:03:08,724 --> 01:03:10,094
(It's Blue Team's turn.)

1690
01:03:10,264 --> 01:03:12,024
- One. - One.

1691
01:03:12,024 --> 01:03:14,124
- Six. - Six.

1692
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:18,724
(Will it be one again as Soo Hong wished?)

1693
01:03:19,564 --> 01:03:20,824
- There it is. - Two.

1694
01:03:21,124 --> 01:03:22,194
It's two.

1695
01:03:22,194 --> 01:03:24,294
(Blue Team only gets 2.)

1696
01:03:24,294 --> 01:03:27,024
I shouldn't have said what I did.

1697
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:28,164
We choose this.

1698
01:03:28,364 --> 01:03:29,594
- Number 10? - Number 2.

1699
01:03:29,594 --> 01:03:32,464
Why are you getting so emotional?

1700
01:03:33,464 --> 01:03:35,124
(Chance Card)

1701
01:03:35,124 --> 01:03:36,364
It doesn't matter if you flip it.

1702
01:03:36,564 --> 01:03:38,724
Gosh, Haha is getting too emotional.

1703
01:03:38,724 --> 01:03:40,094
We'll flip only one block of your land.

1704
01:03:42,094 --> 01:03:43,194
There must be something.

1705
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:44,194
Did you find something?

1706
01:03:45,594 --> 01:03:46,664
Wow.

1707
01:03:46,794 --> 01:03:48,894
Can we tell everyone?

1708
01:03:48,894 --> 01:03:49,994
(What kind of Chance Card is it?)

1709
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:52,494
We won the lottery!

1710
01:03:52,624 --> 01:03:56,594
"You can obtain information on other teams' land."

1711
01:03:57,064 --> 01:03:59,124
Whisper in my ear and ask...

1712
01:03:59,124 --> 01:04:02,064
which block you'd like to know about.

1713
01:04:02,064 --> 01:04:04,694
Pick one. What's your favourite number?

1714
01:04:05,664 --> 01:04:07,464
- I pick 27. - Okay.

1715
01:04:09,564 --> 01:04:10,924
Red Team's 27?

1716
01:04:10,924 --> 01:04:12,024
(Sol Bin picks Red Team's 27.)

1717
01:04:12,024 --> 01:04:13,664
Do you mean 27?

1718
01:04:14,694 --> 01:04:16,424
There's nothing.

1719
01:04:16,664 --> 01:04:17,724
You're so unlucky.

1720
01:04:18,524 --> 01:04:20,094
Goodness.

1721
01:04:20,094 --> 01:04:21,794
No, I'm not.

1722
01:04:21,794 --> 01:04:23,564
There's nothing there.

1723
01:04:24,824 --> 01:04:27,224
- I think you are. - No, I'm not.

1724
01:04:28,294 --> 01:04:30,794
(In that case, how unlucky is Seok Jin?)

1725
01:04:31,024 --> 01:04:32,764
(Blue Team picks Orange Team's 21.)

1726
01:04:32,764 --> 01:04:33,924
What's here?

1727
01:04:35,064 --> 01:04:36,724
(They find a lock combination.)

1728
01:04:36,724 --> 01:04:38,424
- See? I knew it. - Wow.

1729
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:40,894
- I had a good feeling about it. - That was amazing.

1730
01:04:40,894 --> 01:04:41,924
We found it.

1731
01:04:42,324 --> 01:04:43,324
Na Rae, get six.

1732
01:04:43,924 --> 01:04:46,024
(Next up is Na Rae from Orange Team.)

1733
01:04:46,094 --> 01:04:48,494
- Na Rae. - Let's go, Na Rae.

1734
01:04:48,864 --> 01:04:49,894
(It's 2 again.)

1735
01:04:49,894 --> 01:04:51,524
(Oh no)

1736
01:04:51,524 --> 01:04:52,524
It's okay, Na Rae.

1737
01:04:52,524 --> 01:04:53,564
Let's flip one.

1738
01:04:53,864 --> 01:04:55,024
Let's go.

1739
01:04:55,624 --> 01:04:59,464
(They're next to where Red Team found Orange Team's combination.)

1740
01:04:59,464 --> 01:05:01,064
What's going on?

1741
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:02,224
(Pick anything but Blue Team's 4.)

1742
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:03,564
- This one? - Yes.

1743
01:05:04,624 --> 01:05:06,724
(No...)

1744
01:05:08,094 --> 01:05:10,264
(Orange Team finds a lock combination.)

1745
01:05:10,864 --> 01:05:11,924
We found it.

1746
01:05:11,924 --> 01:05:13,064
(Orange Team has one more to go.)

1747
01:05:16,024 --> 01:05:17,624
Let it be six.

1748
01:05:18,724 --> 01:05:20,064
Let it be six.

1749
01:05:20,224 --> 01:05:21,994
(What he says really comes true.)

1750
01:05:21,994 --> 01:05:24,464
- It came true. - I can't believe it.

1751
01:05:24,464 --> 01:05:25,824
What I say comes true.

1752
01:05:26,124 --> 01:05:27,794
(It's unbelievable.)

1753
01:05:27,794 --> 01:05:29,224
This is amazing.

1754
01:05:29,364 --> 01:05:31,364
He's so good at playing games.

1755
01:05:32,794 --> 01:05:34,224
I'm scared of myself.

1756
01:05:34,224 --> 01:05:35,564
How did I know?

1757
01:05:35,864 --> 01:05:38,324
Flip all six of those.

1758
01:05:38,394 --> 01:05:39,794
We should find one here.

1759
01:05:39,924 --> 01:05:40,994
Don't look.

1760
01:05:41,124 --> 01:05:42,324
We're so lucky.

1761
01:05:45,224 --> 01:05:46,464
What's that?

1762
01:05:46,894 --> 01:05:47,894
There it is.

1763
01:05:48,494 --> 01:05:53,124
(It's some kind of Chance Card.)

1764
01:05:53,464 --> 01:05:54,564
Goodness.

1765
01:05:54,564 --> 01:05:56,464
(Pay 50 R to the bank for maintenance fee.)

1766
01:05:56,464 --> 01:05:59,124
- Oh, my goodness. - I'm sorry.

1767
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:01,494
This makes me happy.

1768
01:06:01,494 --> 01:06:02,564
(The others are happy.)

1769
01:06:02,564 --> 01:06:04,164
What's this?

1770
01:06:04,764 --> 01:06:06,924
(It was only the beginning of their misfortune.)

1771
01:06:07,994 --> 01:06:12,194
(They keep getting nothing.)

1772
01:06:12,624 --> 01:06:15,864
Let's drop it and see where it points.

1773
01:06:15,864 --> 01:06:18,624
(They decide to choose where the stick points.)

1774
01:06:18,764 --> 01:06:19,924
It's this one.

1775
01:06:19,924 --> 01:06:21,364
(It's Green Team's 24.)

1776
01:06:24,294 --> 01:06:26,894
(It's a lock combination for Red Team.)

1777
01:06:28,494 --> 01:06:30,724
(All teams found one combination except for Green Team.)

1778
01:06:30,724 --> 01:06:32,494
Wow, we found one.

1779
01:06:33,394 --> 01:06:35,424
How did you find one?

1780
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:38,264
(Green Team is the only team without any lock combinations.)

1781
01:06:40,124 --> 01:06:41,924
How will we ever find it?

1782
01:06:41,924 --> 01:06:44,064
(No one finds anything.)

1783
01:06:44,064 --> 01:06:45,564
It's impossible to find.

1784
01:06:46,064 --> 01:06:48,724
- You're unlucky, aren't you? - No, I'm not.

1785
01:06:50,024 --> 01:06:51,724
(It's Green Team's turn.)

1786
01:06:51,724 --> 01:06:52,824
Let it be six.

1787
01:06:53,024 --> 01:06:54,064
(Kicking)

1788
01:06:55,264 --> 01:06:56,694
It's four.

1789
01:06:56,824 --> 01:06:58,724
- We got four. - Seok Jin.

1790
01:06:59,364 --> 01:07:01,564
We found something.

1791
01:07:02,124 --> 01:07:03,424
(It's a Chance Card.)

1792
01:07:03,424 --> 01:07:04,994
"An angel has appeared."

1793
01:07:06,664 --> 01:07:09,164
(Provide a hint related to where the combination is to another team.)

1794
01:07:09,364 --> 01:07:10,794
We can't afford to do this.

1795
01:07:11,664 --> 01:07:14,564
We can't provide a hint to another team.

1796
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:17,124
Our team is not in... Wait, time out.

1797
01:07:17,524 --> 01:07:18,824
Please listen to me.

1798
01:07:18,824 --> 01:07:20,064
How could you do this?

1799
01:07:20,064 --> 01:07:21,794
(It's over for us if we give out a hint.)

1800
01:07:22,024 --> 01:07:24,164
Red Team, step out of the group.

1801
01:07:24,524 --> 01:07:25,864
- Step out. - You're excluded.

1802
01:07:25,864 --> 01:07:29,064
We'll give a hint to either Orange Team or Blue Team.

1803
01:07:29,064 --> 01:07:31,264
We're desperate for a hint.

1804
01:07:31,264 --> 01:07:33,764
- A lot of things happened today. - If you find one more, you'll win.

1805
01:07:33,764 --> 01:07:35,324
(It's over for one of the two teams.)

1806
01:07:37,064 --> 01:07:41,294
(Which team will Green Team choose?)

1807
01:07:42,564 --> 01:07:45,594
We'll give a hint to Orange Team.

1808
01:07:46,464 --> 01:07:48,464
- Kwang Soo. - You don't want to give it to us?

1809
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:50,924
It's because next is Blue Team's turn.

1810
01:07:50,924 --> 01:07:53,164
- Orange Team. - Where am I standing?

1811
01:07:53,364 --> 01:07:55,424
Do you mean this one?

1812
01:07:55,724 --> 01:07:57,594
Underneath this, you'll find your lock combination.

1813
01:07:57,594 --> 01:07:59,794
Okay, thank you.

1814
01:08:00,164 --> 01:08:01,764
Here we go.

1815
01:08:01,764 --> 01:08:03,164
(It's pretty much Orange Team's victory.)

1816
01:08:03,394 --> 01:08:05,094
Let's check the ones that were flipped.

1817
01:08:05,094 --> 01:08:07,664
We might find our lock combination under the blocks that were flipped.

1818
01:08:10,364 --> 01:08:11,624
Why do you want to flip this one?

1819
01:08:14,624 --> 01:08:16,094
(Eureka!)

1820
01:08:16,094 --> 01:08:18,864
- See? I was right. - How did you know?

1821
01:08:18,864 --> 01:08:20,364
I found it!

1822
01:08:20,364 --> 01:08:21,594
(Why did we find it so late?)

1823
01:08:22,094 --> 01:08:23,894
(Every team has found 1.)

1824
01:08:23,894 --> 01:08:25,524
I just had a good feeling.

1825
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:27,994
- We have two more chances. - Right.

1826
01:08:27,994 --> 01:08:30,424
- We have two chances left. - Finish it this time.

1827
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:31,824
Kwang Soo, we can reverse the score.

1828
01:08:31,824 --> 01:08:34,964
- Wow. - I told you to trust me.

1829
01:08:36,164 --> 01:08:37,524
It has to be 2 or 3.

1830
01:08:37,734 --> 01:08:39,494
I think we got it!

1831
01:08:39,494 --> 01:08:41,234
Get out. Let's finish it here.

1832
01:08:41,234 --> 01:08:42,294
(What are they thinking?)

1833
01:08:42,864 --> 01:08:44,894
There's Leg Spreading Card. What is this?

1834
01:08:45,264 --> 01:08:47,264
We found Leg Spreading Card.

1835
01:08:47,264 --> 01:08:51,294
(You can get hints as much as you spread your legs.)

1836
01:08:51,464 --> 01:08:53,664
- Okay! - We must spread our legs...

1837
01:08:53,664 --> 01:08:54,994
(They can get hints.)

1838
01:08:54,994 --> 01:08:57,264
- But they... - Lie down.

1839
01:08:57,264 --> 01:09:00,424
- How should we do? - Let's bend our legs.

1840
01:09:00,734 --> 01:09:02,594
- We can... - What is Kwang Soo doing?

1841
01:09:04,464 --> 01:09:05,994
(They act as if they don't care.)

1842
01:09:06,064 --> 01:09:07,524
(But in fact, they're focused.)

1843
01:09:08,294 --> 01:09:09,324
Okay?

1844
01:09:09,324 --> 01:09:10,624
(The mind game has begun.)

1845
01:09:10,624 --> 01:09:13,564
- That's intentional. - We're not interested at all.

1846
01:09:13,564 --> 01:09:15,234
- This isn't the right one. - It's not.

1847
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:18,324
- 12, 13... - Wow, he's flexible.

1848
01:09:19,094 --> 01:09:20,824
(Which one would it be?)

1849
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:22,824
- He's good. - You have to reach 19 and 20.

1850
01:09:22,824 --> 01:09:25,124
Kwang Soo, spread your legs wider.

1851
01:09:25,464 --> 01:09:27,234
- Good. - You should keep up.

1852
01:09:27,234 --> 01:09:29,824
- Just one more. - We'll get 12, 19 and 20.

1853
01:09:29,824 --> 01:09:32,364
(They reached 12, 19 and 20 red mats.)

1854
01:09:32,664 --> 01:09:35,864
We'll give you hints for 12, 19 and 20.

1855
01:09:36,124 --> 01:09:37,164
There's nothing...

1856
01:09:37,624 --> 01:09:38,624
under 19.

1857
01:09:39,394 --> 01:09:40,494
There's also nothing...

1858
01:09:40,894 --> 01:09:41,924
under 20.

1859
01:09:42,524 --> 01:09:43,524
And 12...

1860
01:09:43,524 --> 01:09:46,994
(If they get no hints here, they won't be able to win.)

1861
01:09:47,794 --> 01:09:49,194
There's Green Team's combination.

1862
01:09:49,194 --> 01:09:52,424
(They found it.)

1863
01:09:54,624 --> 01:09:56,924
- What are you doing? - Why are you opening the mat?

1864
01:09:57,264 --> 01:09:59,794
(Because there's our combination!)

1865
01:10:00,964 --> 01:10:03,564
(They surprisingly win the round.)

1866
01:10:03,564 --> 01:10:07,524
(This unlucky trio makes a miraculous victory.)

1867
01:10:09,324 --> 01:10:10,624
Let's get on our knees.

1868
01:10:10,624 --> 01:10:13,064
We must repent what we've done today.

1869
01:10:13,124 --> 01:10:15,624
- We were really poor... - It is...

1870
01:10:15,664 --> 01:10:18,264
When Se Chan became my teammate, I thought I'm super unlucky.

1871
01:10:18,264 --> 01:10:19,924
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, but I thought the same.

1872
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:22,194
I was really disappointed when I picked the green ball.

1873
01:10:22,194 --> 01:10:23,924
(Still, they're the winners.)

1874
01:10:24,194 --> 01:10:27,024
As I said earlier, the other three teams will...

1875
01:10:27,024 --> 01:10:29,664
roll the die. And only one member of the team...

1876
01:10:30,264 --> 01:10:34,664
who gets the smallest number will get the penalty.

1877
01:10:34,664 --> 01:10:36,894
- We should roll a die? - But it is...

1878
01:10:36,894 --> 01:10:37,894
What is our prize?

1879
01:10:37,894 --> 01:10:39,024
There is no prize.

1880
01:10:39,024 --> 01:10:40,394
(You won't get any prizes today.)

1881
01:10:44,994 --> 01:10:46,264
My goodness.

1882
01:10:46,364 --> 01:10:48,824
- What is this? - There's no point in winning.

1883
01:10:48,824 --> 01:10:50,564
(The lucky guys win when there's no prize prepared.)

1884
01:10:50,924 --> 01:10:55,064
The penalty for a member of the team with the smallest number...

1885
01:10:55,164 --> 01:10:57,824
is to go home in the suit you're wearing now.

1886
01:10:57,824 --> 01:11:00,664
Record the video with your phone and send it to us.

1887
01:11:00,664 --> 01:11:02,024
That will be humiliating.

1888
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:04,594
- That is... - This is the same as winning.

1889
01:11:07,164 --> 01:11:09,794
- You did a good job. - He's lucky.

1890
01:11:09,794 --> 01:11:10,824
(He rolled only 2 today.)

1891
01:11:10,824 --> 01:11:12,094
(Orange Team is less likely to lose.)

1892
01:11:12,094 --> 01:11:13,294
That was nice.

1893
01:11:13,364 --> 01:11:14,734
- Orange Team is safe. - Let's roll it together.

1894
01:11:14,734 --> 01:11:15,864
Blue Team is the unluckiest team.

1895
01:11:16,124 --> 01:11:18,524
In 1, 2, 3.

1896
01:11:21,234 --> 01:11:22,264
One!

1897
01:11:22,664 --> 01:11:25,524
(Will it go as Soo Hong said?)

1898
01:11:25,524 --> 01:11:26,524
Three!

1899
01:11:27,234 --> 01:11:28,794
It's one!

1900
01:11:28,794 --> 01:11:30,524
(It has once again obeyed Soo Hong.)

1901
01:11:31,864 --> 01:11:33,824
(I can't believe this.)

1902
01:11:34,394 --> 01:11:36,664
(Soo Hong is a prophet.)

1903
01:11:36,824 --> 01:11:40,124
- I'm scared now. - This is amazing.

1904
01:11:40,194 --> 01:11:42,294
(Am I really unlucky this year?)

1905
01:11:43,394 --> 01:11:45,264
- I can't believe this. - No way!

1906
01:11:45,264 --> 01:11:46,824
She's really unlucky this year.

1907
01:11:46,824 --> 01:11:49,424
We can just throw it freely. We already won!

1908
01:11:49,424 --> 01:11:52,264
(Really?)

1909
01:11:52,734 --> 01:11:54,994
We already won! We did!

1910
01:11:55,464 --> 01:11:58,394
(This is truly incredible!)

1911
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:03,024
(They won't get the penalty by a slight margin.)

1912
01:12:03,024 --> 01:12:04,424
This is unbelievable!

1913
01:12:04,424 --> 01:12:06,194
(One of their members will get the penalty.)

1914
01:12:06,194 --> 01:12:07,694
I can't believe this.

1915
01:12:08,734 --> 01:12:10,564
It will be Sol Bin anyway.

1916
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:11,994
So you go first.

1917
01:12:12,524 --> 01:12:15,494
Sol Bin, I think you're the unluckiest idol group member.

1918
01:12:16,624 --> 01:12:17,734
She's really unlucky.

1919
01:12:17,734 --> 01:12:19,064
No, I am not.

1920
01:12:19,694 --> 01:12:21,024
She's so unlucky.

1921
01:12:21,024 --> 01:12:24,664
If you lose this time again, you can join us.

1922
01:12:24,664 --> 01:12:27,564
- This is really unbelievable. - She's unlucky.

1923
01:12:28,394 --> 01:12:29,664
Get ready.

1924
01:12:29,664 --> 01:12:31,524
- It is... - Does it hurt badly?

1925
01:12:31,524 --> 01:12:32,734
- Go! - You don't have to win.

1926
01:12:32,734 --> 01:12:34,324
- Exactly. - Do it now!

1927
01:12:34,664 --> 01:12:36,094
- Go. - Good.

1928
01:12:36,824 --> 01:12:38,424
Who will be the unluckiest member?

1929
01:12:38,664 --> 01:12:39,794
I think it will be Kyu Han.

1930
01:12:39,794 --> 01:12:42,894
(Who will be the unluckiest member?)

1931
01:12:48,994 --> 01:12:51,294
(Screaming)

1932
01:12:52,824 --> 01:12:53,824
It's Kyu Han.

1933
01:12:53,824 --> 01:12:55,894
(He's super unlucky today.)

1934
01:12:56,024 --> 01:12:57,394
- Gosh. - Kyu Han.

1935
01:12:57,394 --> 01:12:59,824
- Gosh. - Wow.

1936
01:13:00,324 --> 01:13:01,524
How can this happen?

1937
01:13:03,024 --> 01:13:04,194
(Sol Bin laughs out loud.)

1938
01:13:04,194 --> 01:13:06,234
- He was the culprit. - It was him.

1939
01:13:06,234 --> 01:13:08,964
- Sol Bin, you're not lucky. - My goodness!

1940
01:13:09,394 --> 01:13:11,024
Kyu Han is the unluckiest.

1941
01:13:11,024 --> 01:13:14,234
(Kyu Han has to go home in the dress he's in now.)

1942
01:13:16,734 --> 01:13:20,024
- Sol Bin, goodbye. It's hot. - Thank you.

1943
01:13:20,324 --> 01:13:21,664
Don't ever show up in front of me.

1944
01:13:23,764 --> 01:13:27,064
Things didn't work as I wanted at all today.

1945
01:13:27,094 --> 01:13:30,024
It was really weird. I lost every time I tried something.

1946
01:13:30,264 --> 01:13:32,194
It was the same when I rolled the die.

1947
01:13:33,394 --> 01:13:36,294
Why don't we have a drink?

1948
01:13:36,294 --> 01:13:37,624
(He wants to drink on this unlucky day.)

1949
01:13:39,294 --> 01:13:40,424
Hello.

1950
01:13:40,424 --> 01:13:41,464
(He's in his suit.)

1951
01:13:41,464 --> 01:13:43,894
(He's going into a restaurant.)

1952
01:13:43,894 --> 01:13:44,964
Oh my goodness.

1953
01:13:46,294 --> 01:13:47,624
Here's yours.

1954
01:13:47,734 --> 01:13:51,124
- Can I have more bean sprouts? - Sure.

1955
01:13:51,524 --> 01:13:53,994
(It looks tasty.)

1956
01:13:54,394 --> 01:13:58,424
I worked really hard today, so I will eat a lot.

1957
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:00,024
Let's go for it.

1958
01:14:01,324 --> 01:14:03,064
We'll have a field day today.

1959
01:14:03,424 --> 01:14:04,864
Hello!

1960
01:14:04,924 --> 01:14:05,924
Son Yeon Jae is here!

1961
01:14:05,924 --> 01:14:06,924
(Beautiful ladies are here!)

1962
01:14:06,924 --> 01:14:07,924
Yeon Jae!

1963
01:14:07,924 --> 01:14:10,924
- Did you all bring gimbap? - Yes.

1964
01:14:11,094 --> 01:14:12,094
(Yu Ra)

1965
01:14:12,964 --> 01:14:14,564
There's a secret agent in each team?

1966
01:14:14,564 --> 01:14:15,564
A secret agent?

1967
01:14:16,524 --> 01:14:17,524
It's pepper.

1968
01:14:17,824 --> 01:14:19,094
(Find the secret agent...)

1969
01:14:19,094 --> 01:14:20,734
(who betrayed us!)

1970
01:14:20,734 --> 01:14:21,764
You're suspicious.

1971
01:14:22,194 --> 01:14:24,524
(Let's enjoy this field day...)

1972
01:14:24,524 --> 01:14:26,394
(with these lovely ladies.)

1973
01:14:26,394 --> 01:14:27,594
(Secret Field Day)
