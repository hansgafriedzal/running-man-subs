1
00:00:04,181 --> 00:00:06,337
(Under the picturesque sky)

2
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:08,969
(Running School)

3
00:00:09,281 --> 00:00:12,281
(There's a field where you can feel that autumn is in the air.)

4
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:16,451
- Hello. - Hello.

5
00:00:16,811 --> 00:00:18,451
Hello.

6
00:00:18,681 --> 00:00:21,551
(Park Mi Sun, the queen of variety shows)

7
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:24,951
- Today is Running Man field day. - Okay.

8
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:27,881
Mi Sun will be the leader of Men's Team and...

9
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:31,451
Jae Seok will be the leader of Women's Team.

10
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:32,511
I'm very satisfied.

11
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:35,081
Have I won the lottery or what?

12
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:36,551
I'm so happy.

13
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:41,581
However, you two are spies.

14
00:00:42,311 --> 00:00:44,281
(Spies?)

15
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:48,611
Actually, Jae Seok is the spy of Men's Team.

16
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:50,011
No, I refuse.

17
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:53,611
I like my team. Why would I ever do that?

18
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:56,481
- Why would I be a spy for them? - Me, too.

19
00:00:56,481 --> 00:00:58,711
Am I the spy of Women's Team?

20
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:01,981
You mean I must help Women's Team secretly?

21
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:05,021
It's going to be hard. I should pretend that I'm helping Men's Team.

22
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:07,411
But in fact, I should help Women's Team, right?

23
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:09,681
- That'll be your job. - But I'm not close to any of them.

24
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:12,311
- I hate girls prettier than me. - I know.

25
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:15,911
- We can do well as team leaders. - They are too pretty.

26
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:20,251
So the photos of these guys are staring at me right now.

27
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,981
Well, they're just mediocre.

28
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:25,151
- I'm not that... - I know what you mean.

29
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,881
- happy about my members. - They are her friends,

30
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:30,881
- but none of them are her type. - Exactly.

31
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:32,751
- Here's another thing. - Okay.

32
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:36,911
Among your team, you can pick a member to help you.

33
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:38,511
(Team leaders can choose another spy in their team.)

34
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,651
- You want me to choose a spy? - Right.

35
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:43,751
(Team leaders can choose another spy among their team.)

36
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:46,451
But the spy you chose...

37
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:49,451
may betray you depending on the situation.

38
00:01:49,451 --> 00:01:52,751
(Spies chosen by the team leaders may betray the leaders.)

39
00:01:52,751 --> 00:02:00,211
(They may betray their leader once before the final race.)

40
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:02,181
- You mean a double spy? - Right.

41
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:05,081
- Then I must pick a decent person. - Yes.

42
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:06,581
- Someone reliable. - You're right.

43
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:09,751
Who would be the most reliable person among these five?

44
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:12,781
- There's none among them. - Is that so?

45
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:15,311
I know.

46
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:21,111
(Whom will they choose?)

47
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:24,651
- We'll start the field day. - What?

48
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:26,651
- Let's do this. - Men's Team, please line up.

49
00:02:26,651 --> 00:02:29,581
Where is Jae Seok? He must be...

50
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:30,851
happy to be out on the green.

51
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,451
Gary, look at you.

52
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:34,251
- Is it still on me? - It's like an accessory.

53
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:36,511
- A dragonfly is on him. - It seems to be comfortable.

54
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:39,421
I think it's there to hide the brand name.

55
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:42,011
- Is it on this side or that? - It's hiding the brand name.

56
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:43,451
That's amazing.

57
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:46,711
- You're becoming one with nature. - Today must be your day.

58
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:50,051
First, the team leader of Men's Team will enter.

59
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:51,381
Will there be a Women's Team today?

60
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:52,811
Is it going to be Jae Seok?

61
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:54,181
- Team leader. - What?

62
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:55,751
Is she going to be our leader?

63
00:02:56,681 --> 00:02:58,781
- Is she going to be our leader? - Hello.

64
00:02:58,781 --> 00:02:59,951
- Hello. - Hello, Mi Sun.

65
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:03,151
(Park Mi Sun, team leader of Men's Team)

66
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:07,251
(You are most welcome.)

67
00:03:07,251 --> 00:03:10,881
- Park Mi Sun. Park Mi Sun. - Yes.

68
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:13,281
- Are you the leader of Men's Team? - Nice.

69
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:14,451
(They're uniting under Mi Sun.)

70
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,851
The last time you were on the show, you had to pay for our dinner.

71
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:18,711
Right, this is the first time after that incident.

72
00:03:18,951 --> 00:03:20,381
- We split the bill together. - We shared the bill.

73
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:23,511
- You're here with me again. - I never thought I'd come again.

74
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:27,251
Since you invited me again, I should visit once in a while.

75
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:30,611
Women's Team, please enter.

76
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:33,311
Jae Seok must be very excited.

77
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:36,051
(He marches in proudly.)

78
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:38,211
It's Min Kyung.

79
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:39,351
- It's Yeon Jae. - It's Son Yeon Jae.

80
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:40,351
It's Min Kyung.

81
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:42,811
- It's Yeon Jae. - It's Yeon Jae.

82
00:03:42,811 --> 00:03:44,511
- And there's also Yu Ra. - It's Yu Ra.

83
00:03:44,511 --> 00:03:45,681
- It's Yu Ra. - It's...

84
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:46,981
- Ji Won. - It's Ji Won.

85
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:49,081
- It's Ji Won. - Goodness.

86
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:50,111
(They are beautiful.)

87
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:51,281
- Hello. - Goodness.

88
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:53,381
(Nationally loved gymnast, Son Yeon Jae)

89
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:54,711
(A beauty with lovely voice, Kang Min Kyung)

90
00:03:54,711 --> 00:03:56,311
(Cute and sexy idol, Yu Ra)

91
00:03:56,311 --> 00:03:57,381
(An elegant actress, Ye Ji Won)

92
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:01,681
(The national beauties are here on Running Man.)

93
00:04:02,181 --> 00:04:03,311
Hello.

94
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:05,951
- Cut it out, Haha. - Hey, Yeon Jae.

95
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:07,181
It's been too long.

96
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:09,151
- I said stop it. - Yeon Jae.

97
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:10,651
- Oh, my. - Stop it.

98
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,411
- Long time no see. - Get back in the line.

99
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:13,711
- Nice to meet you. - Go away.

100
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,011
- Hey, Yu Ra. - That's enough.

101
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:16,951
Hello, Ji Won.

102
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:18,181
Go away.

103
00:04:18,411 --> 00:04:19,651
It's been too long.

104
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:21,151
I'm giving you a warning.

105
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:23,581
Don't talk down to a global star.

106
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:24,721
What do you mean "global star"?

107
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:26,581
Yeon Jae is a world-class athlete.

108
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:28,511
You can't be calling her by her name like that.

109
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:29,581
How else am I supposed to call her?

110
00:04:29,581 --> 00:04:31,251
- That's her name. - As for Min Kyung,

111
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:34,511
she's no longer the worst actress of all time.

112
00:04:35,011 --> 00:04:37,651
Why'd you bring that up?

113
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,111
(Gary imitates Min Kyung's acting.)

114
00:04:40,411 --> 00:04:43,481
(Do you remember this sound?)

115
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:47,251
(This was her first main role as an actress.)

116
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:51,781
(This scene became a legend.)

117
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:56,881
(Her dinosaur-like cry is the key point.)

118
00:04:57,111 --> 00:04:58,581
- I still remember that one. - Don't do it.

119
00:04:58,581 --> 00:04:59,611
Isn't that how it goes?

120
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:00,851
Don't do it.

121
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:03,451
- Her acting got much better now. - That's right.

122
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:05,381
Oh, I almost forgot.

123
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:06,911
Ji Won and I were in the same class,

124
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:08,581
but she keeps insisting that I'm older.

125
00:05:08,581 --> 00:05:10,721
- He's older than me. - Why are you acting like that?

126
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:13,281
She was my partner as the leading actress.

127
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:15,751
- We did a drama together. - Really?

128
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:17,651
- Of course. - We even had a kiss scene.

129
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,911
- Are you serious? - Which drama was that?

130
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:22,381
(Do you remember our kiss?)

131
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:25,721
(They locked lips passionately at the office.)

132
00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:27,181
We were a fantastic couple.

133
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:29,851
That was his first kiss after seven years.

134
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:32,681
(Their kiss scene deserves an award.)

135
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:35,181
- I have a good feeling about today. - Me, too.

136
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:37,381
- We haven't met for so long. - Today is Running Man field day.

137
00:05:37,381 --> 00:05:39,411
It's Men's Team against Women's Team.

138
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:42,481
The team with the higher points will be the final winner.

139
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:44,481
- This'll be way too easy. - They don't stand a chance.

140
00:05:44,481 --> 00:05:46,911
The winner will be awarded with luxurious prizes.

141
00:05:46,911 --> 00:05:48,711
- Luxurious prizes? - Isn't this unfair for us?

142
00:05:48,711 --> 00:05:50,011
- The teams aren't balanced. - I agree.

143
00:05:50,011 --> 00:05:51,111
- The teams are divided by gender. - We don't know the game yet.

144
00:05:51,111 --> 00:05:53,711
- It really depends on the game. - But the Women's Team...

145
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:56,581
Each team has a spy who will prevent their team from winning.

146
00:05:56,881 --> 00:05:59,551
(There's a spy in each team.)

147
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:00,551
Spies?

148
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:03,381
(There's a spy among us?)

149
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:06,251
Lead your team to victory while avoiding the spies.

150
00:06:06,251 --> 00:06:08,111
(They will be given bonus points for ratting out the spy in the voting.)

151
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:09,551
Spies?

152
00:06:10,181 --> 00:06:15,751
(The time has come.)

153
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,281
Each team has a spy?

154
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,911
Why are there spies for a field day?

155
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:22,751
Why don't I ever get to be a spy?

156
00:06:22,951 --> 00:06:24,381
That sounds like something a spy would say.

157
00:06:24,811 --> 00:06:25,881
You're acting strange.

158
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:27,511
- Is it you, Yeon Jae? - What?

159
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:28,981
- It's Yeon Jae. - No, it's not me.

160
00:06:28,981 --> 00:06:30,711
Yeon Jae, are you nervous?

161
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:32,051
It feels a bit strange right now.

162
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,711
I think I've spent too much time in the training ground.

163
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:37,351
I basically live in the gym, too.

164
00:06:38,651 --> 00:06:41,651
- It's a different kind of exercise. - Us athletes have things in common.

165
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:43,381
One thing's for sure, Yeon Jae is a spy.

166
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:44,781
- What? - I'm sure it's her.

167
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:47,351
- Why are you all ganging up on me? - I think it's her, too.

168
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:49,111
- We're ganging up on you? - Yes.

169
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:51,181
You have a temper, don't you?

170
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:53,651
It sounded like that.

171
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:56,011
I love this team.

172
00:06:56,011 --> 00:06:57,511
I love my team, too.

173
00:06:57,511 --> 00:06:59,781
- This is good. - We're all friends here.

174
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:01,851
(The two team leaders are about to get some spy action.)

175
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:07,411
(Who's the other spy that each team leader picked?)

176
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:12,781
Both of the team leaders, please come forward.

177
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:15,151
I actually did something like this when I was in elementary school.

178
00:07:15,151 --> 00:07:17,451
The opening ceremony will be held out by the team leaders.

179
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:18,951
Variety Ceremony.

180
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:20,181
I swear under oath.

181
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:22,711
We will try our hardest to make the viewers laugh.

182
00:07:22,711 --> 00:07:24,651
We won't get scared of being taken bad pictures.

183
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:26,411
We will stand proud in front of the cameras...

184
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:28,451
and try our best for every game.

185
00:07:28,451 --> 00:07:32,181
We swear that we will try our very best to make the viewers laugh.

186
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:33,611
- We swear. - We swear.

187
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:39,281
The 2016 Running Man Field Day will now begin.

188
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:40,551
Let's begin.

189
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:42,481
(It begins now.)

190
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:48,051
(Will the spies be able to carry out their secret missions?)

191
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,351
Let's get the field day started.

192
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:52,351
(Arcade Games)

193
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:55,281
I bet many of you have memories about field days.

194
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:59,151
Back in Mi Sun's days, they held up the torch for the ceremony.

195
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:00,881
Is she that old?

196
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,851
- I remember the old days. - Are you okay?

197
00:08:02,851 --> 00:08:04,111
Are you okay, Mi Sun?

198
00:08:04,111 --> 00:08:05,681
Did you get to shoot an arrow as well?

199
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:07,281
Am I some kind of a hunter?

200
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:09,151
- What are you talking about? - Am I some kind of a hunter?

201
00:08:09,611 --> 00:08:11,251
Did you use golden coins as currency back then?

202
00:08:11,251 --> 00:08:12,751
Are you sure you're not from the Joseon Dynasty?

203
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:15,451
Back then, field days weren't exclusive to students.

204
00:08:15,451 --> 00:08:17,811
It was a day that the whole family came and had fun together.

205
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:20,081
My parents and grandparents would all come and play.

206
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:22,211
I remember playing a game together.

207
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,381
- We threw sandbags. - They were called ojaemi.

208
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:25,411
We would throw things at a basket...

209
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:27,581
and when it opened, it would read, "It's lunch time."

210
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:30,311
- You had those? - Of course.

211
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:33,081
Field days are all about cheerleading.

212
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:35,481
Ding-a-ling, tring-a-ling, you've got a call

213
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,711
The person on the call said White Team has won

214
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:40,151
- No, no, it's a lie - No, no, it's a lie

215
00:08:40,151 --> 00:08:42,381
The person on the call said Blue Team has won

216
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:45,881
- No, no, it's a lie - It's a lie

217
00:08:45,881 --> 00:08:47,051
I remember the old days.

218
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:48,181
Oh, the good old days.

219
00:08:48,281 --> 00:08:50,081
We'll go on forever like this.

220
00:08:50,081 --> 00:08:51,751
I'll tell you the rules of this game.

221
00:08:51,751 --> 00:08:54,411
- There's a picture behind us. - Right.

222
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:57,211
We will start removing the paper piece by piece...

223
00:08:57,211 --> 00:09:00,011
and you have to guess who that person is.

224
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:03,151
The winner of each round will be able to remove a piece.

225
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,581
Let's get the first game started.

226
00:09:06,581 --> 00:09:09,081
It's called "Introduce Yourselves".

227
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,651
- Do we pass around the bomb? - That's right.

228
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:13,511
- Really? - You have 60 seconds.

229
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:14,981
- I'm scared. - A bomb?

230
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:16,181
I know what this is.

231
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:20,821
(Each member introduces oneself and passes around the bomb.)

232
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:25,211
(To win, the team has to use up the time before the bomb goes off.)

233
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:27,381
- Try your best. - Are you ready?

234
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:28,711
Set,

235
00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:30,751
(Nerve-racking)

236
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:33,511
- Set, Go! - I'm nervous.

237
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:38,051
Hello,

238
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:40,881
My name is...

239
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:44,511
Kang Gary.

240
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:47,111
- You're going too slow. - You'll have plenty of time.

241
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:49,251
60 seconds is longer than you think.

242
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:53,151
- Hello, I'm Lee Kwang Soo. - He's going too fast.

243
00:09:53,351 --> 00:09:55,481
- The weather's nice out today. - Five.

244
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:57,411
- Everyone, - Six.

245
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:59,651
- don't catch a cold. - You're taking long.

246
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:02,111
(They feel like the bomb will go off any second now.)

247
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,781
Hello, everyone. I'm Haha.

248
00:10:04,781 --> 00:10:06,081
(They're getting nervous.)

249
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:08,651
It's a field day today.

250
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:11,411
Stay safe, everyone.

251
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:13,211
Please root for our team.

252
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:15,351
Let's go, Men's Team!

253
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:17,251
(What do you mean, "Let's go"?)

254
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:18,951
He took so long. It's going to blow up on you.

255
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,211
He used too much time.

256
00:10:20,211 --> 00:10:22,211
I made a debut as a singer.

257
00:10:22,611 --> 00:10:27,111
(He manages to sing in a tight situation like this.)

258
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,111
I was the best ballad singer.

259
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:30,321
Give it to me.

260
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:34,211
I made a debut as Turbo. I've been in the industry for 21 years.

261
00:10:34,211 --> 00:10:36,481
I'll continue to make more appearances. I'm Kim Jong Kook.

262
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:37,881
He's out of time.

263
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:39,381
Stay healthy, everyone.

264
00:10:39,381 --> 00:10:40,451
Oh, no.

265
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:42,951
The time's up.

266
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:45,551
- Go really fast. - Hello, I'm Park Mi Sun.

267
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:46,911
(The bomb goes off.)

268
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,881
(It blew up as soon as she got her hands on it.)

269
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,651
(The other team looks startled.)

270
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:52,511
Why did you all take so long?

271
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:54,311
- We didn't take long. - I didn't even get to say anything.

272
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:56,481
- We still had a few seconds left. - It blew up on me.

273
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:58,011
We had so much time left.

274
00:10:58,011 --> 00:10:59,911
- We counted it ourselves. - Gosh.

275
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,311
- Are you serious? - It scared me so much.

276
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:03,981
(Spy Mi Sun's acting is spot on.)

277
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:05,281
We were off by three seconds.

278
00:11:05,711 --> 00:11:07,481
- Let's give it a try. - They won't be able to do it.

279
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:08,711
I'm scared.

280
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,251
- Let's go! - Let's go!

281
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:13,211
Set, go!

282
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:15,981
Hello, I'm Yu Jae Seok.

283
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:18,981
I made a debut on 1991 College Comedy Festival.

284
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:21,351
- Why are you using up so much time? - I'm on Running Man right now.

285
00:11:21,351 --> 00:11:22,981
- I'm on Running Man right now. - Pass it on.

286
00:11:23,551 --> 00:11:26,011
Hello, I'm Kang Min Kyung of Davichi.

287
00:11:26,151 --> 00:11:27,811
We are back with a new album.

288
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:31,181
- I think of you everyday - Pass it down.

289
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:34,611
Hello, I'm the rhythmic gymnast, Son Yeon Jae.

290
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,951
She doesn't look scared at all.

291
00:11:36,911 --> 00:11:38,651
Thanks for having me today.

292
00:11:38,651 --> 00:11:40,111
- What should I do with this? - Pass it on.

293
00:11:40,111 --> 00:11:41,681
Hello, I'm actress Ye Ji Won.

294
00:11:41,681 --> 00:11:44,111
I came to see Jae Seok today.

295
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:47,281
It's nice to see you, Jong Kook. I'm doing a drama with Ji Hyo.

296
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:49,651
Hello, I'm Yu Ra of Girl's Day. Nice to meet you.

297
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,181
You have to go faster. Go faster.

298
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:55,011
- Go faster. - Thank you. I love you.

299
00:11:55,011 --> 00:11:56,781
- Don't yell out to stop yet. - Hello, Song Ji Hyo.

300
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:58,981
- Ji Hyo, don't stop yet. - Stop.

301
00:11:58,981 --> 00:12:00,411
- Stop. - You have so much time left.

302
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:03,451
Ji Hyo.

303
00:12:03,981 --> 00:12:05,081
(The bomb goes off.)

304
00:12:05,511 --> 00:12:09,251
- You used up 40 seconds. - I told you there's time left.

305
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:12,151
- It's only been 40 seconds? - Yes.

306
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:13,811
You had to pass it around.

307
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:15,481
I wasn't sure. I got it now.

308
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:19,451
The second game is "Compliment the Opposing Team Leader".

309
00:12:19,551 --> 00:12:20,981
- I see. - But I have nothing to say.

310
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:23,311
We're supposed to give that guy compliments?

311
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,581
Ready, set, go!

312
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:29,751
Jae Seok is the best show host Korea has ever seen.

313
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:31,781
He can be a bit boring,

314
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:35,211
but I want to live his life for once.

315
00:12:35,251 --> 00:12:36,651
- Thank you. - You're the best.

316
00:12:37,051 --> 00:12:38,381
(Jong Kook is next.)

317
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:40,911
Jae Seok is the best show host out there.

318
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:43,411
He's so smart and brags like there's no tomorrow.

319
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:45,411
What do you mean?

320
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:47,611
- That's not true. - That's the person he is.

321
00:12:47,611 --> 00:12:49,251
Don't say it like that.

322
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:50,551
Jae Seok is a good guy.

323
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:53,181
It's irritating to have him around.

324
00:12:54,151 --> 00:12:55,551
He makes me look bad.

325
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:59,251
He's such a role model.

326
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:01,881
He can be so stubborn sometimes. I'm so sick of him.

327
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,811
I feel like I'm standing on a cliff.

328
00:13:03,811 --> 00:13:05,811
- Be careful. - Use your time wisely.

329
00:13:05,811 --> 00:13:06,951
Jae Seok is...

330
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:08,381
ugly but nice.

331
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:11,551
(Jae Seok is ugly but nice.)

332
00:13:11,781 --> 00:13:13,511
Ugly people are usually nice.

333
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,911
Pass it on.

334
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:16,351
- You still have some time left. - Stop.

335
00:13:16,351 --> 00:13:17,611
(Stop.)

336
00:13:18,151 --> 00:13:22,411
(Gary yelled out stop as soon as he got handed the bomb.)

337
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:23,751
Did we do it?

338
00:13:24,211 --> 00:13:26,281
- I won't tell you the record yet. - That's fine.

339
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:28,181
- It was successful, then. - It didn't go off.

340
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:29,811
- I think it was a bit early. - At least the bomb didn't go off.

341
00:13:29,811 --> 00:13:32,651
Keep in mind that we only used 40 second with the last attempt.

342
00:13:32,911 --> 00:13:36,451
You should talk more, Ji Hyo. Let's go again like last time.

343
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:39,711
Are we supposed to compliment Mi Sun?

344
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:41,651
You must have so much to talk about.

345
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:42,881
They'll go on forever.

346
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:45,081
- That's right. - Ready, set, go!

347
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:50,011
Mi Sun is a good role model to young comedians.

348
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:52,081
- I'll start counting. - She taught us...

349
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,781
many lessons regarding marriage.

350
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:56,811
Did they start?

351
00:13:56,811 --> 00:13:58,681
- She's a great role model... - Did they start?

352
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:00,511
who shows how to have a good marriage.

353
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:03,781
- You are showing how to love... - You're speaking for too long.

354
00:14:03,781 --> 00:14:05,081
That's what I think about her.

355
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:06,411
- Take the ball from him. - What was her nickname?

356
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:09,811
- Come on. - Mi Sun is really beautiful.

357
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:15,011
She's also known for her vitality. And she even has abs.

358
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:17,851
- Really? - I admire and respect her.

359
00:14:18,411 --> 00:14:20,881
- Aren't they running out of time? - She was the host...

360
00:14:20,881 --> 00:14:24,151
of my first show. She was so kind and considerate.

361
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:26,351
It was great to meet her there.

362
00:14:26,551 --> 00:14:30,111
I'm Mi Sun's fan. I admire her beauty and intelligence.

363
00:14:30,111 --> 00:14:32,551
Why don't you give Miss Korea a try?

364
00:14:32,551 --> 00:14:34,511
Please show us how beautiful you are in a swimsuit.

365
00:14:34,551 --> 00:14:37,251
You look so young and beautiful.

366
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,451
Thank you for being kind every time we meet.

367
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:41,881
I love you.

368
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,311
Mi Sun, I admire your consistency...

369
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:45,381
(The ball pops.)

370
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:47,181
We failed again.

371
00:14:47,581 --> 00:14:50,381
(The ball explodes in Ji Hyo's hands again.)

372
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:52,551
- Gosh. - Ji Hyo, you're not concentrating.

373
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:55,181
- It exploded as soon as I got it. - Yes. It exploded right away.

374
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:57,251
The ball exploded in your hands two times in a row.

375
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:59,081
- It exploded as soon as she got it. - I couldn't do anything.

376
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:00,081
(You could've done better.)

377
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:02,451
Jae Seok, you spoke for too long.

378
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:05,511
- That's all right - That's all right

379
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:08,881
Ding-a-ling, tring-a-ling, you've got a call

380
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:11,911
The person on the call said Men's Team has won

381
00:15:11,981 --> 00:15:14,911
- No, no, it's a lie - No, no, it's a lie

382
00:15:14,911 --> 00:15:17,811
The person on the call said Women's Team has won

383
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:20,711
- No, no, it's a lie - No, no, it's a lie

384
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,711
The person on the call said Men's Team has won

385
00:15:23,981 --> 00:15:26,181
- No, no, it's a lie - No, no, it's a lie

386
00:15:26,851 --> 00:15:29,181
(Their cheering never stops.)

387
00:15:29,881 --> 00:15:31,551
(You can't beat us.)

388
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:37,181
The person on the call said Men's Team has won

389
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:38,451
(All right. We lost.)

390
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:39,481
They ended the song.

391
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,081
- We won the game. - Yes, we won.

392
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:42,111
(That was really childish.)

393
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:43,711
That was a great ending.

394
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:45,181
All right. Rip one of the strips.

395
00:15:45,181 --> 00:15:47,151
- Let's rip off number three. - Isn't number two a better choice?

396
00:15:47,151 --> 00:15:48,911
- Okay. Let's take number two. - Number two?

397
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:50,911
We don't know which side of the face it'll show.

398
00:15:50,911 --> 00:15:52,881
- That's right. We don't know. - It's the eyes.

399
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:56,181
(These eyes look familiar.)

400
00:15:57,051 --> 00:15:58,081
Isn't she Uhm Jung Hwa?

401
00:15:58,911 --> 00:16:00,211
Yes. I think so, too.

402
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:01,951
Doesn't she look like Uhm Jung Hwa?

403
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:04,081
- I think she's Kim Hee Seon. - All right.

404
00:16:04,081 --> 00:16:06,911
- One, two, three. - She's Kim Hee Seon.

405
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,351
- Five, four, three, - I think she's Uhm Jung Hwa.

406
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:11,881
- two... - All right. One, two, three.

407
00:16:11,881 --> 00:16:13,081
- Kim Hee Seon. - Kim Hee Seon.

408
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:14,911
(Men's Team's answer is Kim Hee Seon.)

409
00:16:14,911 --> 00:16:19,251
(Can they guess who she is only with her eyes?)

410
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:20,711
- She's not. - It's wrong.

411
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:21,711
I think she's Uhm Jung Hwa.

412
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:23,181
We must win this game.

413
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:24,851
We must win this time.

414
00:16:25,081 --> 00:16:26,711
They can guess who she is next time.

415
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:29,811
The next game is "Pass on the Word".

416
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:32,311
("Pass on the Word")

417
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:35,081
Everybody must wear a pair of headphones...

418
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:37,811
and deliver what the person in front of you says.

419
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:39,251
This is really fun.

420
00:16:39,311 --> 00:16:41,611
You will receive a point if the last person guesses the correct answer.

421
00:16:41,611 --> 00:16:44,911
- What a classic game it is. - Yes, it's a famous team game.

422
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:47,911
It won't be easy to win any points. Not even one.

423
00:16:47,911 --> 00:16:50,381
You're right. Shall we begin with Women's Team?

424
00:16:50,381 --> 00:16:51,681
- Yes. - Okay.

425
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:57,311
Ready? Set. Start.

426
00:16:57,511 --> 00:16:58,681
(Americano)

427
00:16:58,681 --> 00:16:59,911
That's too easy.

428
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:03,351
Americano.

429
00:17:05,411 --> 00:17:07,851
Americano.

430
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:09,311
(They're doing great so far.)

431
00:17:09,311 --> 00:17:10,351
(How would Jae Seok perform?)

432
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:11,881
Americano.

433
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:14,181
(Thanks to the easy word, Jae Seok succeeds too.)

434
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:15,911
Americano.

435
00:17:17,381 --> 00:17:18,911
Americano.

436
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:22,381
Americano. Is it correct?

437
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:24,451
(Pickled chili)

438
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:28,681
Pickled chili.

439
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:36,411
Puppy chili.

440
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:39,521
(Puppy chili?)

441
00:17:40,081 --> 00:17:42,211
(What kind of chili is that?)

442
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:43,711
- Hey. - Okay.

443
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:45,911
Pickled chili.

444
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:48,111
(Somehow, Jae Seok says the correct answer.)

445
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:50,651
Gangster chili.

446
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:52,181
(Gangster chili?)

447
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:54,411
(What is a gangster chili?)

448
00:17:54,411 --> 00:17:55,981
- What did she say? - She said, "gangster chili".

449
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:58,351
(That gangster must be quite hot.)

450
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,111
Pickled chili.

451
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:05,281
Pickled chili. Am I correct?

452
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:06,481
(That's correct.)

453
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:07,611
(Baechu geotjeori)

454
00:18:08,211 --> 00:18:09,211
(This one is really difficult.)

455
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:12,151
Baechu geotjeori.

456
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:17,811
Baechu geotjeori.

457
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:19,411
(Min Kyung is correct this time.)

458
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:22,381
Baechu geotjeori.

459
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:24,381
(They are doing fine so far.)

460
00:18:24,381 --> 00:18:26,451
(What kind of strange things will Ji Hyo say this time?)

461
00:18:27,551 --> 00:18:30,581
Something... Something really spicy?

462
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,811
- Isn't she the spy? - She must be the spy.

463
00:18:34,811 --> 00:18:36,151
Something really spicy.

464
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:37,151
(Wrong)

465
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:39,251
Time out.

466
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,651
Women's Team got two points.

467
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:41,711
Really?

468
00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:43,081
Hey, Ji Hyo.

469
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,911
Can you please tell us what "gangster chili" is?

470
00:18:45,411 --> 00:18:46,711
What is it?

471
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:49,081
- Do you know what it is? - It's my first time hearing.

472
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:51,521
- What is "gangster chili"? - She's suspicious.

473
00:18:51,711 --> 00:18:53,981
(Is Ji Hyo really the spy?)

474
00:18:57,981 --> 00:18:58,981
Are you ready?

475
00:18:58,981 --> 00:19:00,251
(Can Men's Team win the second round, too?)

476
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:02,181
Set, start.

477
00:19:02,451 --> 00:19:03,481
(Telepathy)

478
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:08,611
Telepathy.

479
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:10,611
- All right. Next. - He must know this. It's so easy.

480
00:19:10,781 --> 00:19:12,981
- Telephony. - I knew it.

481
00:19:12,981 --> 00:19:14,381
(Telephony)

482
00:19:14,381 --> 00:19:17,681
- Look. He's really strange. - Something's wrong with him.

483
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,281
- Telepathy. - That's right.

484
00:19:21,711 --> 00:19:25,111
"Kkilkki ppappa".

485
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:27,021
"Kkilkki ppappa"?

486
00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:28,211
(Where did kkilkki ppappa come from?)

487
00:19:28,211 --> 00:19:29,521
"Kkilkki ppappa".

488
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:31,081
(They cannot recuperate.)

489
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:32,521
- What's your answer? - Kkilkki ppappa.

490
00:19:33,111 --> 00:19:34,651
(How can "telepathy" be turned into "kkilkki ppappa"?)

491
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:36,111
- Okay, I got it. - All right. Please begin.

492
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:40,611
Hidden message.

493
00:19:41,411 --> 00:19:45,451
- Everybody must speak clearly... - Hidden message.

494
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:51,551
Hidden message.

495
00:19:52,481 --> 00:19:54,411
Hidden message.

496
00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:56,551
Mi Sun is suspicious, too.

497
00:19:56,651 --> 00:19:58,651
Twenty-four, seven.

498
00:19:59,381 --> 00:20:01,411
(Haha changes the word again.)

499
00:20:01,411 --> 00:20:03,711
- What's his problem? - That's so funny.

500
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:06,951
Twenty-four, seven.

501
00:20:07,451 --> 00:20:08,581
Twenty-four, seven.

502
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,811
That sounds really strange.

503
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,651
- Is it over? - Wasn't it twenty-four, seven?

504
00:20:14,651 --> 00:20:16,521
- It was twenty-four, seven. - That was amazing.

505
00:20:16,521 --> 00:20:17,711
(There are spies everywhere.)

506
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:20,411
Somebody changed "telepathy" to "telephony". Who was it?

507
00:20:20,411 --> 00:20:22,021
It wasn't me. It must be one of them.

508
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,551
- Come on. Who was it? - It was me.

509
00:20:23,551 --> 00:20:26,711
- I said, "telephony". - Was it you?

510
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:29,881
- You're so strange. - It wasn't our fault.

511
00:20:29,911 --> 00:20:31,911
Mi Sun, you're suspicious, too.

512
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:33,651
You spoke words too fast.

513
00:20:33,651 --> 00:20:35,151
- What was the answer? - No, I didn't mean it.

514
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,181
- Hey. We... - That wasn't my fault.

515
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,651
- Excuse me. We have to... - It was Kwang Soo.

516
00:20:39,651 --> 00:20:41,781
Stop bothering us! We're have a team meeting!

517
00:20:42,151 --> 00:20:43,711
You'd better stay away.

518
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:46,251
- Calm down. - Stop bothering us.

519
00:20:46,521 --> 00:20:47,551
Which sticker should we take off?

520
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:49,651
- Let's take off number two. - Yes. Number two.

521
00:20:49,651 --> 00:20:51,551
- Let's see the eyes. - Yes. We should see the eyes first.

522
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:53,181
We need to get some points.

523
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:56,411
(Those eyes look very familiar.)

524
00:20:57,521 --> 00:20:59,481
- I know who he is. - Who is that?

525
00:20:59,881 --> 00:21:01,951
- I know that person. - It's Ji Hyo.

526
00:21:02,151 --> 00:21:03,181
Isn't he Son Chang Min?

527
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:05,251
- Mi Sun. Don't say it. - No, he's not.

528
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:08,251
- It's not Son Chang Min. - I don't think so, either.

529
00:21:08,551 --> 00:21:09,911
(Is he the Korean actor, Son Chang Min?)

530
00:21:10,381 --> 00:21:11,911
- Who is that? - Yes. Let's discuss.

531
00:21:12,711 --> 00:21:14,381
- Jackie Chan? - Yes. It's Jackie Chan.

532
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:15,981
- You're right. - Can I say the answer?

533
00:21:15,981 --> 00:21:17,181
Jackie Chan? Really?

534
00:21:17,181 --> 00:21:18,611
(Are those Jackie Chan's eyes?)

535
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:21,711
- Jackie Chan. - I'm not so sure.

536
00:21:22,111 --> 00:21:24,381
- Jackie Chan. - Jackie Chan.

537
00:21:25,021 --> 00:21:31,351
(Women's Team calls out Jackie Chan. Are these Jackie Chan's eyes?)

538
00:21:31,351 --> 00:21:33,311
(They are correct.)

539
00:21:33,711 --> 00:21:35,711
(What a bummer.)

540
00:21:37,251 --> 00:21:39,981
(Women's Team earns a great turnaround victory.)

541
00:21:39,981 --> 00:21:41,281
- We won. - Amazing.

542
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:43,881
(Although he's laughing, Jae Seok must be crying inside.)

543
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:46,711
- That was amazing. - How did you guess that?

544
00:21:46,711 --> 00:21:47,811
(Mi Sun fails to hide her laughter.)

545
00:21:48,351 --> 00:21:50,611
- She must be Jeon Do Yeon. - Isn't she?

546
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:53,011
- That's right. She's Jeon Do Yeon. - I couldn't even imagine.

547
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,481
- Really? - Were her eyes that beautiful?

548
00:21:55,911 --> 00:21:58,411
- There he is. - He's Jackie Chan.

549
00:21:58,411 --> 00:22:00,651
- That's Jackie Chan. - How did she know?

550
00:22:00,651 --> 00:22:02,711
I thought it must be either Son Chang Min or Jackie Chan.

551
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:04,381
I immediately knew it was Jackie Chan.

552
00:22:04,381 --> 00:22:06,511
- That was an amazing turnaround. - All right. So...

553
00:22:07,011 --> 00:22:09,181
Women's Team has won the first game!

554
00:22:09,181 --> 00:22:10,411
(Women's Team wins.)

555
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:11,881
That was amazing.

556
00:22:12,051 --> 00:22:15,411
It's about time for us to have a lunch break.

557
00:22:15,411 --> 00:22:17,781
Lunch break is the most important part of a field day.

558
00:22:17,911 --> 00:22:19,551
It's time for a lunch break.

559
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:21,511
("Make Your Gimbap")

560
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:26,511
All right. We're going to have gimbap for lunch.

561
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,981
- Gimbap is a must-have item. - So today,

562
00:22:27,981 --> 00:22:30,211
we're going to make our own gimbap.

563
00:22:30,211 --> 00:22:31,781
Ingredients are hidden throughout this place.

564
00:22:31,781 --> 00:22:34,911
If you open a box, you must use that ingredient inside.

565
00:22:35,311 --> 00:22:37,911
You must find 10 ingredients and make your own gimbap.

566
00:22:37,911 --> 00:22:40,651
It's called "Make Your Gimbap". You must make your own gimbap.

567
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,651
Can we not throw away some ingredients?

568
00:22:42,651 --> 00:22:43,711
No, you can't

569
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:45,081
All right, let's begin. Let's go.

570
00:22:45,551 --> 00:22:47,811
(How would their gimbap look like in the end?)

571
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:49,751
There's one.

572
00:22:50,511 --> 00:22:51,881
I found one, but...

573
00:22:52,211 --> 00:22:53,451
Just go and grab it.

574
00:22:53,451 --> 00:22:55,711
(They are trying to get the box.)

575
00:22:55,711 --> 00:22:57,081
(Seok Jin steals the box and runs away.)

576
00:22:57,081 --> 00:22:58,181
Don't worry. There's another one.

577
00:22:58,751 --> 00:23:01,411
(What's inside Seok Jin's box?)

578
00:23:01,411 --> 00:23:02,511
(Gummy worms)

579
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:03,511
Oh my gosh.

580
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:05,981
There's one.

581
00:23:05,981 --> 00:23:07,281
(What will the others find?)

582
00:23:07,281 --> 00:23:08,311
I got one!

583
00:23:09,081 --> 00:23:10,081
I got a box!

584
00:23:10,951 --> 00:23:11,981
There's one.

585
00:23:12,781 --> 00:23:14,281
I found another one, too.

586
00:23:16,911 --> 00:23:19,381
- What's inside? - How about yours?

587
00:23:19,651 --> 00:23:21,851
- I think I have the worst one. - Me, too.

588
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,581
- I'm sure mine is worse. - Let me see.

589
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:25,881
- What inside your box? Show me. - Oh, man.

590
00:23:26,851 --> 00:23:28,881
(They picked pickled shrimp and wasabi.)

591
00:23:28,881 --> 00:23:30,011
We got the worst.

592
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:32,481
(Both of them are really unlucky.)

593
00:23:34,451 --> 00:23:35,481
Please...

594
00:23:36,511 --> 00:23:37,881
No! Raw garlic!

595
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:40,211
This is the worst.

596
00:23:40,881 --> 00:23:42,251
(How is Women's Team doing?)

597
00:23:43,711 --> 00:23:44,751
I found one!

598
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:47,211
Please. A good one.

599
00:23:47,381 --> 00:23:48,611
(Please...)

600
00:23:49,781 --> 00:23:52,451
Gosh. I'm so happy with mine.

601
00:23:52,451 --> 00:23:54,211
(She picked ham.)

602
00:23:55,011 --> 00:23:56,011
There's nothing here.

603
00:23:56,011 --> 00:23:57,111
We shouldn't go that way.

604
00:23:57,511 --> 00:23:59,581
- I found another. - There it is.

605
00:23:59,581 --> 00:24:00,711
(Min Kyung finds again.)

606
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:02,251
I missed it.

607
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:04,211
She found one more.

608
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:06,111
- I don't know what's going on. - Why?

609
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,111
This is crazy.

610
00:24:09,751 --> 00:24:11,481
(Eggs)

611
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:14,981
Good job. Did you find one?

612
00:24:16,111 --> 00:24:18,081
- Will there be some here? - There may be.

613
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,081
(Yu Ra and Yeon Jae are looking thoroughly.)

614
00:24:19,081 --> 00:24:20,211
- There is one. - Yeon Jae, Yeon Jae.

615
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:22,551
- You found one. - Can we open it?

616
00:24:22,551 --> 00:24:23,811
(What will there be?)

617
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:25,481
- It's chicken feet. - Are you okay with them?

618
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:27,711
- I love chicken feet. - Do you?

619
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:29,281
We picked nice ones.

620
00:24:30,311 --> 00:24:32,411
(Women's Team acquired wasabi, eggs, spinach, skate, ham,)

621
00:24:32,411 --> 00:24:34,551
(garlic, strawberry jam, cilantro, Cheongyang chili and chicken feet.)

622
00:24:34,551 --> 00:24:36,611
(Men's Team acquired wasabi, pickled shrimp, gummy bear, strawberry jam,)

623
00:24:36,611 --> 00:24:38,681
(marshmallow, sesame oil, biscuit, Cheongyang chili, skate and eggs.)

624
00:24:39,551 --> 00:24:42,551
(They start to make gimbap with the ingredients for the field day.)

625
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,511
May I put some spinach?

626
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:46,581
Are you putting that much?

627
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,581
Chicken feet gimbap looks delicious.

628
00:24:50,311 --> 00:24:51,781
Chicken feet gimbap.

629
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,181
I want to roll it now.

630
00:24:53,181 --> 00:24:55,651
This looks so delicious.

631
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:59,881
(But something is strange.)

632
00:24:59,881 --> 00:25:01,711
- We can't put them all. - Wait a minute.

633
00:25:02,111 --> 00:25:04,081
Let's put some gummy bears and marshmallow.

634
00:25:04,081 --> 00:25:06,211
- What about pickled shrimp? - And strawberry jam.

635
00:25:06,211 --> 00:25:07,451
Who's going to eat this?

636
00:25:07,781 --> 00:25:10,181
(Let me think.)

637
00:25:10,181 --> 00:25:11,911
I think we're giving it to the other team...

638
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:14,481
- That is possible. - so that they can eat.

639
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:16,281
I think we have to exchange them.

640
00:25:17,011 --> 00:25:18,651
- That's possible. - Listen. It doesn't make sense.

641
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:21,881
We could use just a little bit of skate for us.

642
00:25:22,381 --> 00:25:24,511
You sound just like a spy.

643
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:27,411
Hey, I'm not a spy.

644
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:28,911
(They keep suspecting each other.)

645
00:25:28,911 --> 00:25:30,581
(Something's fishy anyway.)

646
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,081
Let's make one gimbap for a penalty.

647
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:34,711
Let's make one.

648
00:25:34,711 --> 00:25:37,051
Put wasabi here.

649
00:25:37,581 --> 00:25:39,081
That's a lot.

650
00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:42,081
My goodness.

651
00:25:42,511 --> 00:25:44,351
This is for a penalty.

652
00:25:44,351 --> 00:25:45,911
I see.

653
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,051
This is too much.

654
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:50,311
- I don't want to cut it. - I've never seen any gimbap...

655
00:25:50,311 --> 00:25:51,681
with skate and strawberry jam in it.

656
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:54,651
(They put wasabi, skate and strawberry jam.)

657
00:25:54,651 --> 00:25:57,181
- And Cheongyang chili. - It'll be so spicy.

658
00:25:57,911 --> 00:25:59,451
I wonder who would eat this.

659
00:26:00,011 --> 00:26:03,381
- What are you doing? - I made a rice ball.

660
00:26:03,381 --> 00:26:05,311
(You can make a rice ball with burst gimbap and cilantro.)

661
00:26:05,311 --> 00:26:07,151
It's Gagamel's rice ball.

662
00:26:07,151 --> 00:26:09,581
(Who would eat this Gagamel's rice ball?)

663
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:13,281
Cheongyang chili and jam makes such an odd combination.

664
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:15,281
Skate and jam makes an even worse combination.

665
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:17,181
- Don't you like it? - It's done.

666
00:26:18,151 --> 00:26:20,051
It's finished. Let's go out.

667
00:26:20,051 --> 00:26:21,911
- It's perfect. - This is great.

668
00:26:21,911 --> 00:26:23,611
We're all finished.

669
00:26:23,881 --> 00:26:27,881
(Is it true that they'll give them to the other team?)

670
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:30,811
- Did you all make gimbap? - Yes.

671
00:26:30,981 --> 00:26:33,151
In fact, fall makes people's heart...

672
00:26:33,151 --> 00:26:35,111
- pound. - You're right.

673
00:26:35,111 --> 00:26:36,881
It's a good season to love.

674
00:26:36,981 --> 00:26:39,711
Yeon Jae, do you feel melancholy in autumn?

675
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:42,411
I feel that way in spring or in fall.

676
00:26:42,511 --> 00:26:44,251
- I want to meet someone. - Right.

677
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:45,411
We're influenced by seasons.

678
00:26:45,411 --> 00:26:47,881
- Spring for women and fall for men. - But...

679
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,581
I couldn't date because I had to practise.

680
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:53,051
Since the Olympics is over now...

681
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:54,451
Oh, really?

682
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:55,781
(Then there's a chance.)

683
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:56,851
Did you open your mind?

684
00:26:56,851 --> 00:26:58,881
- Did you? - I want to meet someone.

685
00:26:58,881 --> 00:27:01,111
I want to meet someone.

686
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:03,381
- I'm surprised. - What kind of a man do you like?

687
00:27:03,381 --> 00:27:04,811
Tell us about your ideal type.

688
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:06,881
I just...

689
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:08,111
- Who, for example? - Is height important?

690
00:27:08,111 --> 00:27:09,811
- I like tall guys. - She likes tall guys.

691
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:11,951
- I like tall guys. - She likes tall guys.

692
00:27:11,981 --> 00:27:13,511
Do you like tall guys?

693
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:15,951
- I don't like a guy as tall as me. - But he's 2m tall.

694
00:27:15,951 --> 00:27:16,951
He's 2m tall.

695
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:19,111
- What are you talking about? - He's still growing.

696
00:27:19,111 --> 00:27:21,111
Why do you say such absurd things?

697
00:27:21,111 --> 00:27:23,281
Don't do that.

698
00:27:23,281 --> 00:27:25,051
His nose gets longer and so do his ears.

699
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:26,581
Kwang Soo is really...

700
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:29,311
Why do you talk about me like that?

701
00:27:29,611 --> 00:27:31,851
He can't live without love.

702
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:34,911
If you have to choose among us, whose appearance do you like?

703
00:27:34,911 --> 00:27:36,251
- Don't ask that. - Choose among you?

704
00:27:36,851 --> 00:27:38,151
(Choose among you?)

705
00:27:38,251 --> 00:27:39,681
Did you see Yeon Jae just now?

706
00:27:39,681 --> 00:27:41,251
"Choose among you?"

707
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,911
This topic is now over.

708
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,381
- You're not the one. - Because...

709
00:27:44,381 --> 00:27:45,911
Because we...

710
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:47,411
You'll be the first one to get eliminated.

711
00:27:47,411 --> 00:27:49,411
There may be someone she likes.

712
00:27:49,411 --> 00:27:50,981
You're the second one to get eliminated.

713
00:27:50,981 --> 00:27:53,411
- You're done. - What's wrong with him today?

714
00:27:53,751 --> 00:27:55,481
You guys are all eliminated.

715
00:27:55,481 --> 00:27:57,281
(You're all eliminated.)

716
00:27:58,081 --> 00:27:59,611
Why did you point me twice?

717
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,381
Why did you point me twice?

718
00:28:01,481 --> 00:28:03,281
- You're childish. - You are.

719
00:28:03,311 --> 00:28:05,181
Ask Yeon Jae directly and end it.

720
00:28:05,181 --> 00:28:06,581
Among you guys?

721
00:28:06,581 --> 00:28:09,111
- If you have to pick one. - According to the appearance?

722
00:28:09,111 --> 00:28:10,611
- According to the looks. - I would just...

723
00:28:11,711 --> 00:28:13,381
I want to meet someone.

724
00:28:13,381 --> 00:28:16,251
(All of them think they stand a chance if it is among themselves.)

725
00:28:16,251 --> 00:28:18,251
- Regardless of height. - I would just...

726
00:28:18,251 --> 00:28:19,881
choose Kwang Soo.

727
00:28:19,881 --> 00:28:21,451
I would choose Kwang Soo.

728
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:22,981
(If it's a dream, he may not want to wake up.)

729
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:25,681
- She doesn't... - You don't care about appearance.

730
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:27,611
- She doesn't care about the looks. - She doesn't.

731
00:28:27,611 --> 00:28:28,651
(Kwang Soo falls in love again.)

732
00:28:28,651 --> 00:28:30,451
He really likes it.

733
00:28:30,611 --> 00:28:33,581
- Did you all make gimbap? - Yes.

734
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:36,151
- We made terrific gimbap. - Yes.

735
00:28:36,211 --> 00:28:38,181
- It's eye-opening. - Yes.

736
00:28:38,211 --> 00:28:39,711
It is really eye-opening.

737
00:28:39,881 --> 00:28:41,581
- You have the worst gimbap, right? - Yes.

738
00:28:41,581 --> 00:28:43,011
Let's exchange and eat them.

739
00:28:43,011 --> 00:28:44,281
Let's exchange and eat them.

740
00:28:44,281 --> 00:28:45,811
(Gosh)

741
00:28:46,551 --> 00:28:54,211
(I knew it. The ingredients were so suspicious.)

742
00:28:57,811 --> 00:29:00,451
- This is not edible. - Is this chocolate?

743
00:29:00,451 --> 00:29:03,381
- No, that is healthy gimbap. - There's chocolate.

744
00:29:03,381 --> 00:29:05,151
Please pick one to taste this.

745
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:07,911
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Okay.

746
00:29:07,911 --> 00:29:10,651
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

747
00:29:10,981 --> 00:29:12,051
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

748
00:29:12,411 --> 00:29:14,451
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

749
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,881
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

750
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:18,151
(Yu Ra, Min Kyung and Jae Seok lost.)

751
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:22,151
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

752
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:24,981
(Yu Ra is chosen.)

753
00:29:24,981 --> 00:29:26,881
- Okay. - Just try one piece.

754
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:29,051
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

755
00:29:30,981 --> 00:29:32,381
(Kwang Soo is chosen.)

756
00:29:32,711 --> 00:29:34,581
(It's okay as long as it's not me.)

757
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:38,781
- It's chocolate, right? - Just try it.

758
00:29:38,781 --> 00:29:39,851
- It's chocolate. - It is edible.

759
00:29:39,851 --> 00:29:42,081
- It doesn't look so bad. - It'll be delicious.

760
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,681
- We made a great combination. - I'm nervous.

761
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,351
That will be better than this.

762
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:51,781
Good. Just don't breathe and swallow it.

763
00:29:52,381 --> 00:29:55,081
- Hold your nose. - Swallow quickly.

764
00:29:55,081 --> 00:29:57,351
(How will it taste when you eat skate and chocolate together?)

765
00:29:57,351 --> 00:29:59,751
(Laughing)

766
00:30:00,951 --> 00:30:02,211
(There you go.)

767
00:30:02,211 --> 00:30:04,381
How does it taste? Please describe the taste.

768
00:30:04,681 --> 00:30:07,281
- How is it? - I tasted wasabi at first,

769
00:30:07,381 --> 00:30:10,281
- That doesn't sound bad. - but later it was all chocolate.

770
00:30:10,411 --> 00:30:13,951
We'll give Kwang Soo...

771
00:30:14,151 --> 00:30:15,781
something special.

772
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,511
- A rice ball. - A rice ball.

773
00:30:17,511 --> 00:30:18,951
- Who made this? - What is this?

774
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:20,651
- Was it a rice ball? - What's that?

775
00:30:21,081 --> 00:30:23,851
I thought it was something you threw away.

776
00:30:23,851 --> 00:30:26,051
The jungle expert made this.

777
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:27,851
Cilantro keeps you away from mosquitoes.

778
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:29,681
I'd rather get bitten by mosquitoes.

779
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:31,081
I'll feed you.

780
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:33,051
- Skate is not bad. - It's okay.

781
00:30:33,111 --> 00:30:35,281
It has all the healthy ingredients.

782
00:30:35,281 --> 00:30:36,711
Cut the cilantro off.

783
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:38,581
He looks like a real giraffe with that.

784
00:30:39,481 --> 00:30:41,051
- A giraffe. - Exactly.

785
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:42,981
He looks exactly like a giraffe.

786
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:49,851
- The skate is... - All the taste kicks in now.

787
00:30:50,211 --> 00:30:52,181
The skate kicks in suddenly.

788
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:54,551
- You can do it. - It's not bad.

789
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:56,981
- You can eat that. - Is it raw garlic?

790
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:59,011
Is it raw garlic?

791
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:01,151
Then you are tasting all the ingredients.

792
00:31:01,211 --> 00:31:03,751
They even put raw garlic.

793
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:06,281
He can taste all the ingredients.

794
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,451
- Right. - Try other normal gimbap now.

795
00:31:09,211 --> 00:31:11,551
- This is... - Try this.

796
00:31:12,711 --> 00:31:14,311
- It's good. - It's delicious.

797
00:31:14,551 --> 00:31:16,181
This gimbap turned out great.

798
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:18,481
- This is tasty. - It's really good.

799
00:31:18,481 --> 00:31:19,811
Come over here and try this.

800
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:22,981
Is there a spy in our team?

801
00:31:23,151 --> 00:31:25,581
- I think there isn't. - Not at all.

802
00:31:25,581 --> 00:31:27,381
Sure, you would say so...

803
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:28,611
because you're the spy.

804
00:31:28,611 --> 00:31:29,711
(You're the spy.)

805
00:31:29,881 --> 00:31:31,051
What's wrong with him?

806
00:31:31,051 --> 00:31:32,911
- You look like a spy to me, too. - I also think so.

807
00:31:32,911 --> 00:31:35,251
- I can see the spy in your team. - Who is it?

808
00:31:35,251 --> 00:31:36,611
Seok Jin.

809
00:31:37,451 --> 00:31:39,651
There are three in your team.

810
00:31:39,651 --> 00:31:41,351
Thank you for your attention.

811
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:44,281
Let me introduce the third Round of the field day.

812
00:31:44,281 --> 00:31:46,251
"Find Your Staff".

813
00:31:46,251 --> 00:31:48,011
("Find Your Staff")

814
00:31:48,381 --> 00:31:50,351
- What does that mean? - What's that?

815
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:51,681
- "Find Your Staff". - What's that?

816
00:31:51,681 --> 00:31:54,781
Each team will stand on each side.

817
00:31:54,781 --> 00:31:56,081
At the signal of a whistle,

818
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:58,711
run towards the bar in the centre.

819
00:31:58,711 --> 00:32:00,981
Men's Team should check the blue bags...

820
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:03,611
and Women's Team should look for the red bags.

821
00:32:03,781 --> 00:32:06,481
There will be a note with a key word in each bag.

822
00:32:06,481 --> 00:32:08,711
Find a staff related to the key word...

823
00:32:08,711 --> 00:32:11,751
and get verified at the front desk.

824
00:32:12,481 --> 00:32:16,151
(Verified couples tie their bracelets together.)

825
00:32:16,381 --> 00:32:20,351
(You'll win if you remove all the bracelets of the other team.)

826
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:23,281
If you don't find your staff, he or she will be eliminated.

827
00:32:23,881 --> 00:32:27,111
The bags of Men's Team is hanging high.

828
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,511
- Yes. - It's not fair.

829
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:30,681
Haha or Gary...

830
00:32:30,681 --> 00:32:32,111
(Haha or Gary...)

831
00:32:33,181 --> 00:32:35,511
Yeon Jae can jump higher than me.

832
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:37,481
She can probably jump higher.

833
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:40,051
She can put her feet on my shoulder and tie her shoelaces.

834
00:32:40,051 --> 00:32:41,911
Try it. Can you do that?

835
00:32:41,911 --> 00:32:44,551
- May I? - Go ahead. She puts it here.

836
00:32:44,551 --> 00:32:46,881
She can tie her shoelaces in this position.

837
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,081
- Are you sure? - She puts it here.

838
00:32:48,081 --> 00:32:49,811
(She's so flexible.)

839
00:32:49,811 --> 00:32:51,811
She can tie her shoelaces in this position.

840
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:55,811
(Let me try.)

841
00:32:55,811 --> 00:32:57,281
(He falls over.)

842
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,851
(He seems to be kicked out.)

843
00:32:59,851 --> 00:33:01,481
- Gosh. - You're mean.

844
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,111
- I wanted to help him. - Gosh.

845
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:04,511
I just wanted to help him.

846
00:33:04,511 --> 00:33:06,781
- You're too harsh. - He could've been injured.

847
00:33:07,311 --> 00:33:08,381
I said I helped.

848
00:33:08,451 --> 00:33:10,381
I did.

849
00:33:10,381 --> 00:33:12,381
- Shall we start? - Yes.

850
00:33:12,581 --> 00:33:14,251
Let's put our hands together.

851
00:33:14,481 --> 00:33:15,881
- Upwards? - Downwards?

852
00:33:15,881 --> 00:33:18,611
In 1, 2, 3. Let's go.

853
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:21,211
In 1, 2, 3. We can do it.

854
00:33:21,211 --> 00:33:23,651
- Let's help each other. - Okay.

855
00:33:23,651 --> 00:33:24,781
- Can I cut in? - We don't need to hurry.

856
00:33:24,781 --> 00:33:26,111
- Kwang Soo, help me please. - One bag per person?

857
00:33:26,111 --> 00:33:28,011
- We don't need to hurry at all. - Ready...

858
00:33:29,351 --> 00:33:33,181
(How will the spies act in this game?)

859
00:33:33,181 --> 00:33:34,511
Start.

860
00:33:34,511 --> 00:33:38,511
("Find Your Staff" has started.)

861
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:40,381
- It's okay. - Block them.

862
00:33:40,981 --> 00:33:42,381
- Block them. - It's okay.

863
00:33:42,581 --> 00:33:43,811
(They jump high.)

864
00:33:43,811 --> 00:33:45,311
- Oh my. - I can't.

865
00:33:45,711 --> 00:33:50,281
(Women's Team quickly gets all the bags.)

866
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:53,851
Did you take it at your first try?

867
00:33:53,881 --> 00:33:55,011
Please grab one for me.

868
00:33:55,011 --> 00:33:56,151
(Please grab one for me.)

869
00:33:56,511 --> 00:33:57,551
I can't reach.

870
00:33:58,011 --> 00:33:59,181
Go for it!

871
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:01,711
- Lift me up. - In 1, 2, 3.

872
00:34:03,311 --> 00:34:04,651
- It's ticklish. - My goodness.

873
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:06,181
- What should I do, then? - You're tickling me.

874
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,681
One, two...

875
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:09,281
Why are you so ticklish?

876
00:34:09,451 --> 00:34:10,681
It's too ticklish. I can't.

877
00:34:12,211 --> 00:34:13,881
(A man with strong arms.)

878
00:34:13,881 --> 00:34:15,281
Who is it?

879
00:34:16,611 --> 00:34:19,111
"A man who weighs over 100kg"?

880
00:34:19,181 --> 00:34:20,311
Gosh.

881
00:34:20,311 --> 00:34:21,351
What?

882
00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:23,421
There's no one who looks like a celebrity.

883
00:34:23,551 --> 00:34:24,981
- What's yours? - Mine?

884
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:26,511
Did you see anyone who looks like a celebrity?

885
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:28,011
The youngest director?

886
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:29,881
"Someone who looks single"?

887
00:34:31,281 --> 00:34:32,651
A person who looks like a celebrity?

888
00:34:32,651 --> 00:34:35,181
(Their partners are revealed.)

889
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:36,281
The youngest screen writer.

890
00:34:37,011 --> 00:34:41,211
(All the members now know who'll be their partner.)

891
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:43,211
Let me see your hand.

892
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:45,051
Yours is smaller than mine.

893
00:34:45,351 --> 00:34:46,681
My hands are pretty big.

894
00:34:47,011 --> 00:34:49,851
- Who looks like a celebrity? - How much do you weigh, Kwon Ryeol?

895
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:51,711
- I don't see any here. - Tell me now.

896
00:34:51,981 --> 00:34:54,681
- Tell me how much you weigh. - Who looks like a celebrity?

897
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:57,981
Double eyelids. No, it's nothing.

898
00:34:57,981 --> 00:34:59,811
(She has to find a man with double eyelids.)

899
00:34:59,811 --> 00:35:00,951
I don't see any.

900
00:35:01,111 --> 00:35:02,851
Does anyone here think they're handsome?

901
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:05,851
Are there any handsome guys?

902
00:35:05,881 --> 00:35:08,311
Are you the youngest director? Who's the youngest one?

903
00:35:08,551 --> 00:35:09,581
The one who looks like...

904
00:35:09,581 --> 00:35:11,951
- Do you look like a celebrity? - It's you, right?

905
00:35:12,281 --> 00:35:13,611
- It's you, isn't it? - It's me.

906
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,681
Let's hurry.

907
00:35:14,681 --> 00:35:15,851
You're single, aren't you?

908
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:17,481
Come here.

909
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:19,611
You obviously look single.

910
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:21,711
I brought the youngest writer.

911
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:23,111
The youngest writer.

912
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,081
- You got it right. - Okay!

913
00:35:26,051 --> 00:35:27,181
Sir.

914
00:35:27,181 --> 00:35:28,281
(She has to find a person with strong arms.)

915
00:35:28,281 --> 00:35:29,351
Sir.

916
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,381
Sir.

917
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:33,211
Can I cling onto your arm for five seconds?

918
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:36,051
I'm heavy.

919
00:35:36,281 --> 00:35:37,381
In 1, 2, 3.

920
00:35:37,851 --> 00:35:40,681
One, two, three, four, five.

921
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:42,781
I found him.

922
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:44,311
(She found the right partner.)

923
00:35:44,981 --> 00:35:46,051
I found the youngest director.

924
00:35:46,351 --> 00:35:48,981
The youngest director? You brought the right one.

925
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:50,511
Who is the handsome person?

926
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,751
You must appoint someone else.

927
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:55,781
This is ridiculous. He's not handsome.

928
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:57,981
- I might look handsome to her. - We must be objective.

929
00:35:57,981 --> 00:35:59,651
It can't be subjective.

930
00:35:59,651 --> 00:36:02,011
- I found him. - No way, it's nonsense.

931
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:03,981
- This has to be objective. - I think...

932
00:36:04,051 --> 00:36:05,551
- we can make it. - Send him back!

933
00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:07,381
- My eyes look fine. - For this show,

934
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:09,251
- we must send him back. - This part of my face is handsome.

935
00:36:09,381 --> 00:36:11,781
(Let me see how handsome you are.)

936
00:36:11,781 --> 00:36:13,581
My goodness.

937
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:16,511
He's not handsome.

938
00:36:17,311 --> 00:36:20,581
(Ji Won and the handsome guy get bracelets.)

939
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:23,651
How can everyone here not have double eyelids?

940
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:25,581
Does anyone have double eyelids?

941
00:36:26,811 --> 00:36:28,081
There's no one.

942
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:30,781
- What happened? - No one has double eyelids here.

943
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:31,951
Double eyelids...

944
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:33,951
- Do you have double eyelids? - Gosh.

945
00:36:33,951 --> 00:36:35,811
- Wait a minute. - No one has double eyelids.

946
00:36:36,081 --> 00:36:37,581
- He doesn't... - Does anyone have double eyelids?

947
00:36:38,051 --> 00:36:39,421
- No one. - What about you?

948
00:36:39,651 --> 00:36:41,651
(Will Yeon Jae end up being alone?)

949
00:36:41,651 --> 00:36:43,751
- Does anyone have double eyelids? - No one does.

950
00:36:43,811 --> 00:36:45,881
- This is unbelievable. - How can there be no one?

951
00:36:45,881 --> 00:36:47,451
Do you have them?

952
00:36:48,111 --> 00:36:50,011
I think he does.

953
00:36:50,281 --> 00:36:51,981
He has double eyelids.

954
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:54,781
He just follows you although he doesn't have any.

955
00:36:55,451 --> 00:36:57,921
You just follow her because it's Yeon Jae.

956
00:36:58,111 --> 00:36:59,181
Wait.

957
00:36:59,181 --> 00:37:01,051
Who looks like a celebrity?

958
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:02,921
I don't know anyone who looks like a celebrity.

959
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:05,381
No one looks like a celebrity here.

960
00:37:05,381 --> 00:37:08,051
(He looks like he's in a hurry,)

961
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:13,981
(but he has been helping others until now.)

962
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:20,451
(All that he's been doing was helping Women's Team.)

963
00:37:20,451 --> 00:37:21,611
(Men's Team, please keep up for me.)

964
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:23,311
No one looks like a celebrity.

965
00:37:25,481 --> 00:37:28,051
Let's run. There are two more.

966
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:30,081
Jong Kook will come here soon.

967
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:33,781
(Let's go catch Kwang Soo.)

968
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:35,881
Jong Kook, put the bracelet on now!

969
00:37:37,681 --> 00:37:39,811
(Kwang Soo is in crisis.)

970
00:37:40,311 --> 00:37:41,451
Kwang Soo!

971
00:37:41,451 --> 00:37:42,711
(I'm coming!)

972
00:37:43,081 --> 00:37:45,011
Kwang Soo! No way!

973
00:37:45,081 --> 00:37:46,081
Stop!

974
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:47,711
(Kwang Soo struggles to fight two women.)

975
00:37:47,711 --> 00:37:48,851
(They rip his name tag.)

976
00:37:48,881 --> 00:37:49,921
I got it!

977
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:51,311
(Kwang Soo is out!)

978
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,551
No way!

979
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:56,711
(Ji Won is very skilful.)

980
00:37:56,711 --> 00:37:58,511
My goodness.

981
00:37:58,511 --> 00:38:01,981
(Ji Won finds Jong Kook distracted.)

982
00:38:01,981 --> 00:38:04,421
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

983
00:38:04,421 --> 00:38:05,751
(She removes Jong Kook's name tag.)

984
00:38:05,881 --> 00:38:06,921
(Jong Kook is eliminated.)

985
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:08,011
I pulled it off!

986
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:10,421
- I removed two name tags. - It's a double kill.

987
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:12,811
(Ji Won succeeds in eliminating Kwang Soo and Jong Kook.)

988
00:38:13,551 --> 00:38:15,311
- Are you out? - Everyone is so sluggish.

989
00:38:15,311 --> 00:38:17,381
- We all should exercise hard. - Right.

990
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:20,111
Why are the staff so bad at running?

991
00:38:20,111 --> 00:38:22,381
Come to our gym and work out starting next week.

992
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:24,311
- You need some exercise. - From next week.

993
00:38:25,211 --> 00:38:30,851
(Jong Kook and Kwang Soo are eliminated.)

994
00:38:31,581 --> 00:38:33,311
Cling onto his sleeve for five seconds.

995
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,381
(Let's see if his arms are strong enough.)

996
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:36,581
- I'll start. - Start.

997
00:38:39,081 --> 00:38:42,151
- Gosh! We made it before! - Let's do it again.

998
00:38:42,151 --> 00:38:43,711
Have you yet to find your partner?

999
00:38:43,711 --> 00:38:46,351
I found him and I clung onto his arm for five seconds.

1000
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:49,981
- And he failed this time? - Yes, he failed this time.

1001
00:38:49,981 --> 00:38:52,881
- He's so mean. - I'm sure it was intentional.

1002
00:38:52,881 --> 00:38:54,051
I'm so stressed out.

1003
00:38:54,051 --> 00:38:55,851
(Is it Jae Seok's scheme?)

1004
00:38:56,811 --> 00:38:57,951
Thank you.

1005
00:38:58,581 --> 00:39:00,681
Thank you. Please keep it a secret.

1006
00:39:01,851 --> 00:39:02,951
(What did you say?)

1007
00:39:02,951 --> 00:39:05,111
Please don't turn away.

1008
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:07,011
You're not busy now.

1009
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:09,781
- I should find a strong man. - I'm not strong.

1010
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:12,111
I'll cling onto your arm.

1011
00:39:12,111 --> 00:39:15,881
Just drop me after two seconds.

1012
00:39:15,881 --> 00:39:17,381
I have weak arms.

1013
00:39:17,381 --> 00:39:18,611
That's what I want.

1014
00:39:18,951 --> 00:39:20,681
Because I'm a spy.

1015
00:39:21,211 --> 00:39:24,011
(She whispers to him that she's a spy.)

1016
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:26,921
(Is Min Kyung really a spy?)

1017
00:39:28,181 --> 00:39:32,451
(3 hours ago)

1018
00:39:32,451 --> 00:39:36,281
You'll choose one of your teammates to be a fellow spy.

1019
00:39:36,281 --> 00:39:38,251
- A fellow spy? - Yes.

1020
00:39:39,051 --> 00:39:40,251
Whom should I pick?

1021
00:39:40,481 --> 00:39:45,851
(Whom has he chosen to be their fellow spies?)

1022
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:47,981
I'll choose Min Kyung.

1023
00:39:49,081 --> 00:39:52,181
(He chose Min Kyung.)

1024
00:39:52,381 --> 00:39:57,881
Today, you're a spy of Men's Team.

1025
00:39:58,111 --> 00:39:59,421
- A spy? - Yes.

1026
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:01,151
(Now, she's a spy of Men's Team.)

1027
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:04,581
You'll have only one chance...

1028
00:40:04,581 --> 00:40:08,181
to betray your fellow spy and quit being a spy.

1029
00:40:08,181 --> 00:40:11,851
(She's given a chance to quit being a spy.)

1030
00:40:11,851 --> 00:40:14,551
Then I can choose either way.

1031
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:17,251
But if you lose after betraying, you'll get harsher penalty.

1032
00:40:17,951 --> 00:40:19,981
My goodness.

1033
00:40:20,111 --> 00:40:21,981
- Do you understand? - Yes, I do.

1034
00:40:21,981 --> 00:40:23,481
(If she doesn't win, she gets a penalty.)

1035
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:29,581
(So she dragged on in the Arcade Games round...)

1036
00:40:29,581 --> 00:40:33,251
(and came up with a ridiculous answer.)

1037
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:41,051
(She even asked the staff to intentionally fail the mission.)

1038
00:40:41,281 --> 00:40:46,251
(Everything was a part of her scheme.)

1039
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:48,251
Be careful.

1040
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:50,281
(They'll participate in "Bracelet Battle".)

1041
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,711
We must stay together.

1042
00:40:51,711 --> 00:40:52,711
Wait.

1043
00:40:54,781 --> 00:40:56,211
We must move together.

1044
00:40:57,051 --> 00:40:58,111
Be careful.

1045
00:40:58,211 --> 00:41:00,181
(Ji Hyo is out.)

1046
00:41:03,381 --> 00:41:04,421
It hurts.

1047
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,311
(Ji Won grabs Gary's bracelet.)

1048
00:41:06,311 --> 00:41:07,681
(It breaks.)

1049
00:41:08,421 --> 00:41:10,011
(Gary is out.)

1050
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:11,151
You did a great job.

1051
00:41:12,581 --> 00:41:13,751
Wait!

1052
00:41:15,551 --> 00:41:17,381
(Haha attacks Ji Won.)

1053
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:18,451
I got it. Okay.

1054
00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:19,951
I made it. Are you okay?

1055
00:41:19,951 --> 00:41:21,481
(Ji Won is out.)

1056
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:22,651
I shouldn't have put my guard down.

1057
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:25,481
Wait a minute.

1058
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:28,451
(Yu Ra is under attack by 2 members.)

1059
00:41:28,511 --> 00:41:30,481
- It's okay. - What's this?

1060
00:41:30,481 --> 00:41:31,481
(Yu Ra is out.)

1061
00:41:31,951 --> 00:41:33,551
Gosh, this is really hard.

1062
00:41:34,811 --> 00:41:40,081
(Gary, Ji Won and Yu Ra are eliminated.)

1063
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,081
- Thank you. - Now, go.

1064
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:43,211
(Some haven't even started the battle.)

1065
00:41:43,211 --> 00:41:44,351
She looks like Sulli.

1066
00:41:44,781 --> 00:41:46,281
- Sulli. - This is nonsense.

1067
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:47,951
- She looks like Sulli. - Go bring someone else.

1068
00:41:47,951 --> 00:41:49,181
What are you talking about?

1069
00:41:49,181 --> 00:41:51,051
- She looks like Sulli. - Next!

1070
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,811
- What do you mean, next? - The one with bigger hands.

1071
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:53,951
Hey, Sulli!

1072
00:41:54,651 --> 00:41:56,421
She looks exactly like Sulli.

1073
00:41:56,421 --> 00:41:57,451
(We apologise to Sulli's fans.)

1074
00:41:57,451 --> 00:41:58,481
Goodness.

1075
00:41:58,751 --> 00:42:00,851
This is ridiculous.

1076
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:01,851
(Spy Jae Seok is doing a good job.)

1077
00:42:01,981 --> 00:42:03,281
(Min Kyung, I'm counting on you.)

1078
00:42:03,551 --> 00:42:05,811
- It's really unfavourable for us. - Wait.

1079
00:42:05,811 --> 00:42:07,581
(She's trying to make someone remove her bracelet.)

1080
00:42:07,751 --> 00:42:10,181
(Do not worry, Jae Seok.)

1081
00:42:11,881 --> 00:42:13,251
You're so scary.

1082
00:42:13,251 --> 00:42:14,481
(She's acting.)

1083
00:42:14,481 --> 00:42:15,651
(Screaming)

1084
00:42:15,651 --> 00:42:16,711
He's so strong.

1085
00:42:17,511 --> 00:42:20,921
(Spy Mi Sun and Spy Min Kyung are fighting.)

1086
00:42:20,951 --> 00:42:22,081
Hey!

1087
00:42:22,811 --> 00:42:24,251
(My goodness.)

1088
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:26,451
(It got ripped.)

1089
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:28,251
- It hurts. - Yeon Jae!

1090
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:34,181
(Yeon Jae was watching for a good chance.)

1091
00:42:36,581 --> 00:42:38,681
(She made it.)

1092
00:42:39,421 --> 00:42:40,511
Yeon Jae!

1093
00:42:41,381 --> 00:42:42,481
Stop there!

1094
00:42:42,481 --> 00:42:44,511
(She's giggling.)

1095
00:42:44,681 --> 00:42:45,751
Yes!

1096
00:42:47,051 --> 00:42:49,751
(It's really chaotic here.)

1097
00:42:49,751 --> 00:42:51,181
Please stop. No.

1098
00:42:51,181 --> 00:42:52,981
(No!)

1099
00:42:53,251 --> 00:42:56,011
(I can't win.)

1100
00:42:58,681 --> 00:43:01,381
(What?)

1101
00:43:01,381 --> 00:43:03,781
(Spy Mi Sun is out in an awkward way.)

1102
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:04,951
Goodness.

1103
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:08,581
(Someone grabs Haha.)

1104
00:43:09,651 --> 00:43:11,681
My goodness. You scared me.

1105
00:43:11,921 --> 00:43:14,581
(Min Kyung's partner is doing his best to win.)

1106
00:43:14,581 --> 00:43:15,681
Did we win?

1107
00:43:15,811 --> 00:43:16,811
Goodness.

1108
00:43:17,281 --> 00:43:18,681
- Did we win? - He's too good at this.

1109
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:20,751
- We won! - He's really strong.

1110
00:43:22,051 --> 00:43:24,611
- We won? - We won!

1111
00:43:24,611 --> 00:43:27,751
(Women's Team removed all the bracelets and won.)

1112
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:30,081
(I'm doomed.)

1113
00:43:30,081 --> 00:43:31,481
Women's Team...

1114
00:43:31,481 --> 00:43:33,211
wins this round!

1115
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:35,281
(It's 0 to 200.)

1116
00:43:36,611 --> 00:43:37,811
Gosh.

1117
00:43:37,811 --> 00:43:41,681
(Women's Team already earned 200 points.)

1118
00:43:41,681 --> 00:43:44,581
I think our team's spy...

1119
00:43:44,781 --> 00:43:46,981
- is really incompetent. - That's right.

1120
00:43:46,981 --> 00:43:49,811
- So... - We even said we didn't have one.

1121
00:43:49,811 --> 00:43:51,711
(She remembers something.)

1122
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:55,911
You're a spy for Men's Team,

1123
00:43:56,011 --> 00:44:01,711
but you get one chance to betray your teammate and quit being a spy.

1124
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:05,011
(She gets one chance to join Women's Team.)

1125
00:44:05,011 --> 00:44:08,111
So I could join Women's Team...

1126
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:11,211
if Men's Team doesn't look like winning. I get it.

1127
00:44:12,551 --> 00:44:13,551
Yes.

1128
00:44:14,511 --> 00:44:17,111
(Women's Team is leading by 200 points. What will Min Kyung do?)

1129
00:44:17,111 --> 00:44:19,151
Do you have a moment?

1130
00:44:19,151 --> 00:44:20,911
Ji Won is getting suspicious of me.

1131
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:22,411
- This'll just raise more questions. - No.

1132
00:44:22,411 --> 00:44:24,151
(Min Kyung calls over her fellow spy.)

1133
00:44:24,151 --> 00:44:27,181
Jae Seok, there's a mark that indicates I'm a spy on my back.

1134
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:29,281
What are you doing?

1135
00:44:31,281 --> 00:44:32,881
The method is simple.

1136
00:44:33,011 --> 00:44:36,311
You need to take Jae Seok's name tag off and put it back on.

1137
00:44:36,311 --> 00:44:39,611
(You need to take Jae Seok's name tag off and put it back on.)

1138
00:44:42,351 --> 00:44:43,351
What are you doing?

1139
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:47,681
(It's off.)

1140
00:44:47,681 --> 00:44:48,811
Hold on.

1141
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,881
(It's back on.)

1142
00:44:51,881 --> 00:44:53,681
(Spy Min Kyung has successfully betrayed her team leader.)

1143
00:44:54,181 --> 00:44:57,411
The final race is always the highlight of a field day.

1144
00:44:57,411 --> 00:44:58,711
- Right. - It's the relay race.

1145
00:44:58,711 --> 00:45:00,251
The winner will get 200 points.

1146
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:02,411
- Do we have 200 points? - Yes.

1147
00:45:02,411 --> 00:45:03,981
If we win, it's a tie, right?

1148
00:45:03,981 --> 00:45:06,411
It will be a tie and you can take the lead by winning the spy vote.

1149
00:45:06,411 --> 00:45:09,711
Men's Team is just doing bad regardless of the spies.

1150
00:45:09,711 --> 00:45:11,611
I think we're all spies here.

1151
00:45:11,611 --> 00:45:13,151
- They have at least three. - I think so, too.

1152
00:45:13,251 --> 00:45:15,451
We have too many spies here. They're so bad at the games.

1153
00:45:15,451 --> 00:45:17,151
People who aren't even spies are acting like one.

1154
00:45:17,151 --> 00:45:20,151
- We're just bad at these games. - I know.

1155
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:21,911
- Are you a spy? - No.

1156
00:45:21,911 --> 00:45:23,481
- At least three of us are spies. - Never.

1157
00:45:23,511 --> 00:45:26,581
- Are you a spy? - You know I'm innocent.

1158
00:45:27,611 --> 00:45:30,011
- Are you a spy? - No, I'm not.

1159
00:45:30,011 --> 00:45:31,181
He sounds like one.

1160
00:45:31,181 --> 00:45:33,411
Aren't you a smuggler?

1161
00:45:33,411 --> 00:45:36,311
- You're on the top of the list. - He's such a spy.

1162
00:45:36,311 --> 00:45:37,781
- He's a spy. - Did you see that?

1163
00:45:38,051 --> 00:45:39,051
The pupils were like this.

1164
00:45:39,051 --> 00:45:40,581
(Those were the eyes of a spy.)

1165
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:43,081
(His pupils are dilated.)

1166
00:45:44,111 --> 00:45:46,451
I thought you were Lee Kyung Kyu for a second.

1167
00:45:46,451 --> 00:45:48,611
- His eyes were like this. - You found a talent.

1168
00:45:48,611 --> 00:45:49,811
He's definitely a spy.

1169
00:45:49,811 --> 00:45:53,111
- This is hilarious. - The real spy must be happy.

1170
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,781
We have so many spies on our team.

1171
00:45:54,781 --> 00:45:56,211
(Who's the spy on Men's Team?)

1172
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,711
If there's a spy on our team, she's doing a very poor job.

1173
00:45:58,711 --> 00:46:01,181
- She's a bad spy. - I'm sure it's Min Kyung.

1174
00:46:01,611 --> 00:46:04,981
Me? Why? I tried really hard.

1175
00:46:04,981 --> 00:46:06,581
It'll be shocking if you turned out to be a spy.

1176
00:46:06,581 --> 00:46:07,681
I feel betrayed already.

1177
00:46:09,581 --> 00:46:10,611
Are you not?

1178
00:46:10,611 --> 00:46:12,781
(What will happen to the ex-spy who chose to betray?)

1179
00:46:13,581 --> 00:46:16,611
If you look at the front, you'll see the batons.

1180
00:46:16,611 --> 00:46:17,611
Okay.

1181
00:46:18,411 --> 00:46:19,681
- What's that? - Why is it so big?

1182
00:46:19,681 --> 00:46:22,711
- Are you sure it's not a pillow? - That's the baton?

1183
00:46:22,711 --> 00:46:25,251
(It's extra-large.)

1184
00:46:25,251 --> 00:46:27,281
(I'll give that to Men's Team.)

1185
00:46:27,881 --> 00:46:31,281
This might be unfair for Women's Team.

1186
00:46:32,811 --> 00:46:34,511
That would be a disadvantage to us.

1187
00:46:34,511 --> 00:46:35,711
It was an honest mistake.

1188
00:46:35,951 --> 00:46:38,781
- Are you kidding me? - It was a mistake.

1189
00:46:38,781 --> 00:46:42,081
- Sorry, kid. - Don't call me that.

1190
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:47,251
(I'm sorry, it was a mistake.)

1191
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:49,611
- I can't beat him. - That's enough.

1192
00:46:49,611 --> 00:46:51,511
You tried.

1193
00:46:51,511 --> 00:46:52,781
(There's a reason why they made me the spy.)

1194
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:54,781
You have to throw it further than you think.

1195
00:46:54,981 --> 00:46:56,511
We should most definitely win.

1196
00:46:56,611 --> 00:46:58,311
- Are you ready? - Go, Jong Kook.

1197
00:46:58,311 --> 00:47:01,181
You have to do good, Jong Kook. Prove us that you're not a spy.

1198
00:47:01,181 --> 00:47:02,181
I can do this.

1199
00:47:02,181 --> 00:47:03,781
(I'll prove it to you.)

1200
00:47:04,151 --> 00:47:05,181
(I have faith in you, Jong Kook.)

1201
00:47:05,181 --> 00:47:07,611
We'll be able to tell the spies from this.

1202
00:47:07,611 --> 00:47:08,611
Here I go.

1203
00:47:08,611 --> 00:47:12,251
(You won't be suspicious any more after this.)

1204
00:47:12,951 --> 00:47:14,411
Oh, my.

1205
00:47:14,411 --> 00:47:15,411
(I can't let them take the lead after I betrayed them.)

1206
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:22,211
(It went beyond the line.)

1207
00:47:23,781 --> 00:47:25,081
I knew it. You're suspicious.

1208
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:26,681
Are you really a spy?

1209
00:47:26,811 --> 00:47:28,411
Is he crazy?

1210
00:47:28,411 --> 00:47:30,351
(Keep it up.)

1211
00:47:30,951 --> 00:47:33,081
(Is Jong Kook really a spy?)

1212
00:47:33,381 --> 00:47:34,511
Ji Won, you can do it.

1213
00:47:34,511 --> 00:47:35,811
It's not about kicking it far away.

1214
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,411
Don't let it go over the line.

1215
00:47:38,811 --> 00:47:40,681
- You have very small feet. - Yes, I do.

1216
00:47:41,811 --> 00:47:42,951
(Here it goes.)

1217
00:47:44,481 --> 00:47:48,311
(It's nowhere close, but it didn't go over the line.)

1218
00:47:48,311 --> 00:47:49,311
Okay.

1219
00:47:49,611 --> 00:47:50,781
- Did we win? - Good job.

1220
00:47:50,781 --> 00:47:53,081
Is it a 1 on 1 battle?

1221
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:55,311
(Good job, team.)

1222
00:47:56,311 --> 00:47:57,451
- Can I go? - Let's see how Gary does.

1223
00:47:57,451 --> 00:47:58,681
(Gary's up next.)

1224
00:47:58,681 --> 00:48:00,111
- There you go. - That was good.

1225
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:01,481
He's leading the scoreboard so far.

1226
00:48:02,481 --> 00:48:03,511
(Yu Ra goes 4th.)

1227
00:48:03,511 --> 00:48:04,511
That's good.

1228
00:48:05,311 --> 00:48:09,311
(She takes the lead.)

1229
00:48:11,011 --> 00:48:13,011
Her shoe didn't roll.

1230
00:48:13,011 --> 00:48:14,911
(This is why I chose this team over Men's Team.)

1231
00:48:15,181 --> 00:48:16,811
- You can do it. - I think we got this.

1232
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:17,811
(Seok Jin's up next.)

1233
00:48:18,051 --> 00:48:19,251
It's looking good.

1234
00:48:19,251 --> 00:48:20,811
(I have my hopes on Seok Jin.)

1235
00:48:22,811 --> 00:48:25,411
(Seok Jin fails.)

1236
00:48:26,611 --> 00:48:28,081
(Is he a spy or is he just bad?)

1237
00:48:28,081 --> 00:48:31,011
- I slipped. - He's so bad.

1238
00:48:31,311 --> 00:48:33,911
(Everyone else did worse than Yu Ra.)

1239
00:48:35,181 --> 00:48:36,681
Why didn't hers roll over?

1240
00:48:36,681 --> 00:48:38,411
(Yu Ra of Women's Team is leading.)

1241
00:48:39,111 --> 00:48:41,411
- She's a spy. - No, I'm not.

1242
00:48:41,411 --> 00:48:43,311
I think Yeon Jae will shoot it high up.

1243
00:48:43,411 --> 00:48:45,181
I think it'll go backwards.

1244
00:48:45,181 --> 00:48:46,211
(Kwang Soo is up next for the losing team.)

1245
00:48:46,881 --> 00:48:48,681
You're so bad.

1246
00:48:48,681 --> 00:48:50,611
(They're taunting him.)

1247
00:48:50,611 --> 00:48:53,181
- You're so bad. - You're so bad.

1248
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:54,351
(I don't care if I'm the spy. I just want him to fail.)

1249
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:55,951
- Cut that out. - Why?

1250
00:48:55,951 --> 00:48:57,711
- I can see you. - I'm getting ready for my turn.

1251
00:48:57,711 --> 00:48:58,711
I'll give it a go.

1252
00:48:58,881 --> 00:49:00,451
(He's concentrating.)

1253
00:49:00,781 --> 00:49:01,811
You can't do it.

1254
00:49:01,811 --> 00:49:02,811
(I just want to disturb you.)

1255
00:49:02,811 --> 00:49:05,311
Just get it over with. We don't care.

1256
00:49:05,351 --> 00:49:07,751
- Don't look at me. - You won't be able to do it.

1257
00:49:07,981 --> 00:49:10,111
Gosh, you're bothering me.

1258
00:49:10,151 --> 00:49:12,051
Kwang Soo, you'll do very bad.

1259
00:49:12,051 --> 00:49:13,211
(They keep babbling on.)

1260
00:49:13,811 --> 00:49:14,811
Here I go.

1261
00:49:16,081 --> 00:49:17,711
You're very tall.

1262
00:49:17,711 --> 00:49:19,881
(He turns his head away and shoots.)

1263
00:49:19,881 --> 00:49:21,011
That's good.

1264
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:22,581
(How did he do?)

1265
00:49:23,781 --> 00:49:25,111
(Is this for real?)

1266
00:49:25,551 --> 00:49:26,711
- You're very tall. - That's good.

1267
00:49:26,711 --> 00:49:27,911
That's good.

1268
00:49:29,081 --> 00:49:31,051
(He rewrites the history of field days with that kick.)

1269
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,251
Okay!

1270
00:49:32,411 --> 00:49:35,451
- That was amazing. - Good job.

1271
00:49:36,051 --> 00:49:38,081
(He is no longer the unlucky man.)

1272
00:49:39,011 --> 00:49:40,211
(Did that really just happen?)

1273
00:49:40,781 --> 00:49:42,511
- The game is over. - How are we supposed to beat that?

1274
00:49:42,511 --> 00:49:43,911
(Praise me.)

1275
00:49:43,911 --> 00:49:45,381
The game's over already.

1276
00:49:45,411 --> 00:49:48,111
(Men's Team will win at this rate.)

1277
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:49,151
Yeon Jae.

1278
00:49:49,951 --> 00:49:53,211
(Kwang Soo is leading.)

1279
00:49:53,881 --> 00:49:55,651
- You did good. - You have to get it on the line.

1280
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,711
(It's time to get back at him.)

1281
00:49:57,711 --> 00:49:59,681
Get back in the line.

1282
00:49:59,781 --> 00:50:01,511
(I'm not going to try anyway.)

1283
00:50:01,511 --> 00:50:04,911
- What are you doing? - I'm practising.

1284
00:50:04,911 --> 00:50:06,181
(We can't let you off that easy.)

1285
00:50:06,611 --> 00:50:09,181
- Don't you lay your hands on me. - Okay.

1286
00:50:11,411 --> 00:50:12,881
(One, two, three.)

1287
00:50:12,881 --> 00:50:14,681
(Jae Seok gets kicked in the butt.)

1288
00:50:15,551 --> 00:50:18,311
(I'm your team leader!)

1289
00:50:18,311 --> 00:50:20,411
- I'm sorry. - You crossed the line there.

1290
00:50:20,411 --> 00:50:21,951
(How dare you abuse our team leader?)

1291
00:50:22,151 --> 00:50:24,411
- I'm sorry. - Isn't that a foul?

1292
00:50:24,411 --> 00:50:26,151
- He just kicked me. - The game hasn't' started yet.

1293
00:50:26,151 --> 00:50:27,781
(Do you have any idea how much I'm trying to make you win?)

1294
00:50:28,751 --> 00:50:32,851
- We have to look after our own. - That's right.

1295
00:50:32,951 --> 00:50:34,781
(The pink barricade goes up.)

1296
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:37,511
It's been weeks since I had a good team.

1297
00:50:41,681 --> 00:50:44,781
(Are you that happy?)

1298
00:50:44,781 --> 00:50:47,351
- Good job. - Why'd you do that?

1299
00:50:47,351 --> 00:50:48,781
(Stop bothering our team leader.)

1300
00:50:49,951 --> 00:50:50,981
(Jae Seok and Yeon Jae are the only members left for Women's Team.)

1301
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:52,281
- Good job. - I'm sorry, Jae Seok.

1302
00:50:53,051 --> 00:50:54,651
- You did very good. - Here it goes.

1303
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:56,051
You're the best.

1304
00:50:56,051 --> 00:50:57,311
(I'll go easy at first.)

1305
00:50:59,981 --> 00:51:02,781
(It was a very good shot for a spy.)

1306
00:51:02,781 --> 00:51:04,511
- Is it over? - I should've done better.

1307
00:51:04,511 --> 00:51:05,511
We won.

1308
00:51:05,511 --> 00:51:07,681
(Yeon Jae is our only hope.)

1309
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:10,911
Son Yeon Jae.

1310
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:12,151
(Yeon Jae is the last person up for Women's Team.)

1311
00:51:12,181 --> 00:51:14,211
She wins if she gets it right on the line.

1312
00:51:14,211 --> 00:51:15,211
You're the best, Yeon Jae.

1313
00:51:17,651 --> 00:51:19,681
She was vibrant and strong.

1314
00:51:19,681 --> 00:51:21,051
(She's acrobatic, strong and has a sense of distance.)

1315
00:51:21,051 --> 00:51:22,811
She did good.

1316
00:51:23,351 --> 00:51:25,611
(Will Yeon Jae lead her team to victory?)

1317
00:51:25,611 --> 00:51:27,611
- Here I go. - Do it.

1318
00:51:30,581 --> 00:51:33,781
(She shoots.)

1319
00:51:34,751 --> 00:51:38,411
(I can't let her take back the lead.)

1320
00:51:41,511 --> 00:51:44,611
(She failed to take the lead.)

1321
00:51:44,611 --> 00:51:45,951
You came really close, though.

1322
00:51:45,951 --> 00:51:47,181
That was close.

1323
00:51:47,181 --> 00:51:48,811
She did really well.

1324
00:51:48,811 --> 00:51:51,181
(Maybe I shouldn't have betrayed.)

1325
00:51:51,811 --> 00:51:55,481
Women's Team gets the big baton and Men's Team gets the small one.

1326
00:51:56,551 --> 00:51:59,251
(Both spies had a tight strategic battle.)

1327
00:51:59,451 --> 00:52:02,081
(Min Kyung quit being a spy and betrayed Jae Seok.)

1328
00:52:02,081 --> 00:52:04,011
I think we're all spies here.

1329
00:52:04,011 --> 00:52:06,281
(Who's the last spy hidden among Men's Team?)

1330
00:52:06,511 --> 00:52:08,881
(Introducing the relay course)

1331
00:52:08,881 --> 00:52:11,611
(Step 1: Hurdling)

1332
00:52:11,881 --> 00:52:17,411
(Step 2: Roll the gym ball to the finishing line.)

1333
00:52:17,411 --> 00:52:21,411
(Spin 10 times holding your nose and cross the walk.)

1334
00:52:22,611 --> 00:52:25,781
(Step 3: Eat a caramel and whistle.)

1335
00:52:29,611 --> 00:52:32,311
(Step 4: Limbo)

1336
00:52:35,551 --> 00:52:38,281
(Step 5: Push face through plastic wrap and scream to 125 decibels.)

1337
00:52:38,981 --> 00:52:42,711
(Step 6: Roll the ball, tumble and catch.)

1338
00:52:45,981 --> 00:52:49,611
(Step 7: Open the basket together.)

1339
00:52:49,611 --> 00:52:50,851
Who's going first?

1340
00:52:51,351 --> 00:52:53,111
- Okay. - I can't...

1341
00:52:53,411 --> 00:52:54,611
I can't do this.

1342
00:52:54,881 --> 00:52:56,051
Seok Jin is out.

1343
00:52:56,311 --> 00:52:58,481
I didn't know they would be that close to one another.

1344
00:52:58,851 --> 00:53:01,351
This looks hard. I had no idea.

1345
00:53:01,881 --> 00:53:04,011
(Mi Sun tries the plastic wrap course.)

1346
00:53:04,011 --> 00:53:06,511
(This is a bit embarrassing.)

1347
00:53:07,111 --> 00:53:09,051
I didn't know I have to push my face through plastic wrap.

1348
00:53:10,011 --> 00:53:11,211
Yu Ra, are you doing this as well?

1349
00:53:11,211 --> 00:53:13,151
(Should we just go back home?)

1350
00:53:13,381 --> 00:53:16,851
Mi Sun, I had no idea we have to do this.

1351
00:53:17,711 --> 00:53:19,581
This'll make us look terrible.

1352
00:53:19,581 --> 00:53:20,881
I think I made the wrong decision.

1353
00:53:20,881 --> 00:53:23,111
- We made the wrong choice. - I didn't know we'd do this.

1354
00:53:23,111 --> 00:53:24,681
(Sorry, it's too late now.)

1355
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,411
(Yeon Jae tries catching the ball.)

1356
00:53:27,411 --> 00:53:28,451
It hurts so much.

1357
00:53:28,811 --> 00:53:31,451
This isn't as easy as it looks.

1358
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:34,151
(This is child's play to me.)

1359
00:53:35,951 --> 00:53:36,951
(She drops the ball.)

1360
00:53:37,711 --> 00:53:39,151
Can I catch it with my feet?

1361
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:40,211
This isn't easy at all.

1362
00:53:40,611 --> 00:53:43,481
- It's harder this way. - I figured it out now.

1363
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:46,611
(In numerical order, it's hurdling, gym ball, caramel, limbo,)

1364
00:53:46,611 --> 00:53:48,511
(plastic wrap, rolling the ball and opening the basket.)

1365
00:53:49,011 --> 00:53:50,311
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1366
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:52,681
(This is their last chance to take the lead.)

1367
00:53:52,681 --> 00:53:55,581
(This is the chance for Men's Team to get even with Women's Team.)

1368
00:53:55,581 --> 00:53:58,481
(For Women's Team, it's a chance to win by 400 points.)

1369
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:03,351
(Please don't make the betrayal and spying go to waste.)

1370
00:54:05,981 --> 00:54:07,451
("Relay Race" starts.)

1371
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:10,081
(They charge towards the hurdles.)

1372
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:12,581
(Hurdles fall.)

1373
00:54:14,081 --> 00:54:16,751
(Are they hurdles or dominoes?)

1374
00:54:16,751 --> 00:54:19,281
I'm in trouble. What should I do?

1375
00:54:19,281 --> 00:54:20,981
They all fell.

1376
00:54:21,111 --> 00:54:23,181
It must be harder than it seems.

1377
00:54:23,181 --> 00:54:24,451
(Everyone's watching.)

1378
00:54:24,451 --> 00:54:26,551
- What should I do? - They all fell.

1379
00:54:26,911 --> 00:54:28,181
Seok Jin!

1380
00:54:28,481 --> 00:54:31,081
- Seok Jin! Hurry! - Hey.

1381
00:54:31,581 --> 00:54:34,351
(Jae Seok is fulfilling his duties as a spy.)

1382
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:36,411
I'm winning.

1383
00:54:36,411 --> 00:54:39,281
(The next runners came to watch.)

1384
00:54:39,981 --> 00:54:44,281
(Seok Jin is like a spy even though he's not.)

1385
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,651
This is so annoying.

1386
00:54:45,651 --> 00:54:48,651
Is he a spy?

1387
00:54:48,851 --> 00:54:50,351
Are you a spy?

1388
00:54:51,281 --> 00:54:53,311
I didn't know it'd be this hard.

1389
00:54:53,681 --> 00:54:55,051
This is so annoying.

1390
00:54:55,151 --> 00:54:56,951
This is really annoying.

1391
00:54:57,311 --> 00:54:59,911
- It's too slow. - Jae Seok is taking too long.

1392
00:54:59,911 --> 00:55:01,881
Is he a spy?

1393
00:55:02,081 --> 00:55:04,011
(Is our team leader a spy?)

1394
00:55:04,511 --> 00:55:06,011
When will they be finished?

1395
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,251
This is so hard.

1396
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:09,851
It's really hard.

1397
00:55:09,851 --> 00:55:12,311
I've never seen hurdles as timid as these.

1398
00:55:12,381 --> 00:55:14,011
What is this?

1399
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:16,251
You're supposed to jump over hurdles.

1400
00:55:16,251 --> 00:55:18,651
- Are you a spy? - These hurdles...

1401
00:55:19,251 --> 00:55:21,151
(Suspicious)

1402
00:55:22,311 --> 00:55:26,011
(They're finally almost finished.)

1403
00:55:27,751 --> 00:55:30,681
(Seok Jin is a bit ahead.)

1404
00:55:30,951 --> 00:55:33,611
(I have to go faster than Kwang Soo.)

1405
00:55:33,811 --> 00:55:34,951
You got this!

1406
00:55:38,211 --> 00:55:40,051
Go!

1407
00:55:40,751 --> 00:55:41,811
Good!

1408
00:55:41,811 --> 00:55:42,851
(Men's Team is ahead in the 2nd part.)

1409
00:55:44,981 --> 00:55:47,811
(Stop there!)

1410
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:53,151
(They arrived almost at the same time.)

1411
00:55:54,511 --> 00:55:57,981
(Jae Seok taking a long time on purpose.)

1412
00:55:58,051 --> 00:55:59,981
- Where's the zipper? - Open it!

1413
00:56:01,451 --> 00:56:03,051
Hurry out!

1414
00:56:05,981 --> 00:56:07,081
Come out.

1415
00:56:08,051 --> 00:56:10,051
You look like a goddess now.

1416
00:56:10,051 --> 00:56:11,481
(Because of Jae Seok, the other team caught up.)

1417
00:56:11,481 --> 00:56:12,951
Turn 10 times.

1418
00:56:12,951 --> 00:56:14,051
Turn 10 times.

1419
00:56:14,251 --> 00:56:16,881
(She's very fast.)

1420
00:56:16,881 --> 00:56:18,281
Kwang Soo!

1421
00:56:18,281 --> 00:56:19,551
(You're doing great, Min Kyung.)

1422
00:56:20,181 --> 00:56:21,681
I'm really bad at this.

1423
00:56:21,951 --> 00:56:22,981
I can't do this.

1424
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:25,281
You've turned 10 times.

1425
00:56:27,311 --> 00:56:28,351
Min Kyung.

1426
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:31,181
(He seems drunk.)

1427
00:56:34,711 --> 00:56:35,751
(Everyone's watching this funny scene.)

1428
00:56:35,751 --> 00:56:38,711
- That's hilarious. - It looks so funny.

1429
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,181
Go!

1430
00:56:42,581 --> 00:56:46,281
(There are drunk runners.)

1431
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:49,781
(Kwang Soo puts one foot on.)

1432
00:56:49,851 --> 00:56:51,681
What should I do? I should go forward.

1433
00:56:51,681 --> 00:56:54,811
(She continues taking drunk steps.)

1434
00:56:55,151 --> 00:56:56,451
What will she do?

1435
00:56:56,681 --> 00:56:57,781
She can't walk.

1436
00:56:57,781 --> 00:56:59,551
She's almost as fast as Kwang Soo.

1437
00:56:59,551 --> 00:57:01,981
(She takes big steps.)

1438
00:57:03,651 --> 00:57:05,451
(Here we go.)

1439
00:57:09,751 --> 00:57:13,951
(They finished almost at the same time.)

1440
00:57:15,581 --> 00:57:18,381
(Eat a caramel and whistle)

1441
00:57:18,411 --> 00:57:19,611
What's that?

1442
00:57:19,611 --> 00:57:22,011
(Their face is covered with flour.)

1443
00:57:22,411 --> 00:57:23,651
My goodness.

1444
00:57:23,781 --> 00:57:24,881
What's that?

1445
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:28,511
(He found it.)

1446
00:57:30,051 --> 00:57:31,681
- He found it. - Go on.

1447
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:33,711
(They have to whistle after eating the caramel.)

1448
00:57:33,711 --> 00:57:35,151
- He found it. - Go on.

1449
00:57:35,851 --> 00:57:37,481
(Whistle now.)

1450
00:57:38,151 --> 00:57:40,151
(It's too chewy.)

1451
00:57:40,151 --> 00:57:41,951
You're almost done.

1452
00:57:42,211 --> 00:57:44,051
Let's do this!

1453
00:57:45,081 --> 00:57:46,751
You're almost there.

1454
00:57:47,451 --> 00:57:49,081
I can't whistle.

1455
00:57:49,281 --> 00:57:50,381
- There you go. - Yes!

1456
00:57:50,381 --> 00:57:51,781
(Haha charges towards the 4th section.)

1457
00:57:51,781 --> 00:57:53,151
Ji Hyo.

1458
00:57:53,751 --> 00:57:55,011
Ji Hyo.

1459
00:57:55,911 --> 00:57:58,151
- I can't whistle. - There you go.

1460
00:57:59,081 --> 00:58:01,081
(Ji Hyo is finally done.)

1461
00:58:01,081 --> 00:58:03,351
Ji Hyo, hurry.

1462
00:58:03,951 --> 00:58:05,581
- He passed it! - There you go!

1463
00:58:05,581 --> 00:58:06,711
(Gary passed the limbo stick at once.)

1464
00:58:06,711 --> 00:58:08,411
- He passed it! - Is it done?

1465
00:58:08,411 --> 00:58:11,411
- It's done! - Do the limbo!

1466
00:58:11,411 --> 00:58:12,651
Oh my.

1467
00:58:12,651 --> 00:58:14,411
(Men's Team's baton is handed over to a spy.)

1468
00:58:14,411 --> 00:58:16,611
- We should help her. - Mi Sun.

1469
00:58:16,651 --> 00:58:18,711
Go through it.

1470
00:58:19,411 --> 00:58:21,211
What should she do?

1471
00:58:21,211 --> 00:58:22,281
(Yu Ra, here I come.)

1472
00:58:22,281 --> 00:58:23,351
Yu Ra!

1473
00:58:25,611 --> 00:58:27,811
- Hurry. - Do it.

1474
00:58:27,811 --> 00:58:30,211
(Yu Ra starts the 5th section.)

1475
00:58:31,151 --> 00:58:33,051
- Continue. - Hurry.

1476
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:36,351
You have to continue.

1477
00:58:36,351 --> 00:58:38,781
(Mi Sun is taking a long time on purpose.)

1478
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:40,251
You're almost there.

1479
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:42,281
(They're fighting with their faces.)

1480
00:58:42,281 --> 00:58:43,781
- You're almost there. - I can't breathe.

1481
00:58:43,781 --> 00:58:45,111
Use the top of your head.

1482
00:58:45,111 --> 00:58:46,651
Use all your strength.

1483
00:58:47,011 --> 00:58:49,251
(A space monster)

1484
00:58:49,251 --> 00:58:50,811
Use the top of your head.

1485
00:58:50,811 --> 00:58:52,211
- Use the top of your head. - You're almost there.

1486
00:58:52,411 --> 00:58:53,451
(Go through it, Yu Ra!)

1487
00:58:53,781 --> 00:58:56,151
- It's almost torn. - You're almost there.

1488
00:58:56,151 --> 00:58:57,611
- It's almost done. - You're almost there.

1489
00:58:57,611 --> 00:58:59,081
Please stop!

1490
00:58:59,351 --> 00:59:01,781
Why did you volunteer to do this?

1491
00:59:02,481 --> 00:59:05,081
Please stop now.

1492
00:59:05,381 --> 00:59:07,681
Why did you want to do this?

1493
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:10,611
Why did you volunteer?

1494
00:59:12,481 --> 00:59:15,551
You have nothing to lose.

1495
00:59:15,551 --> 00:59:16,751
(She looks like she has already lost everything.)

1496
00:59:16,751 --> 00:59:19,211
Hold the plastic wrap.

1497
00:59:19,351 --> 00:59:21,781
It's torn here.

1498
00:59:22,181 --> 00:59:24,011
- Hold the plastic. - There you go.

1499
00:59:24,011 --> 00:59:25,951
- There you go. - Yes!

1500
00:59:26,111 --> 00:59:27,181
It's done.

1501
00:59:27,951 --> 00:59:30,181
(She'll pass if she gets more than 125 decibels.)

1502
00:59:31,681 --> 00:59:33,051
(Yu Ra is done.)

1503
00:59:34,111 --> 00:59:36,281
Run!

1504
00:59:36,451 --> 00:59:38,451
My goodness.

1505
00:59:38,911 --> 00:59:41,881
- Hurry. - Stop, Mi Sun.

1506
00:59:41,881 --> 00:59:44,151
It's torn here.

1507
00:59:44,151 --> 00:59:47,011
Come through here.

1508
00:59:47,411 --> 00:59:49,651
- There you go. - It's done.

1509
00:59:49,651 --> 00:59:50,951
Scream now.

1510
00:59:50,951 --> 00:59:51,981
(Screaming)

1511
00:59:52,051 --> 00:59:53,951
- Come nearer. - Come near.

1512
00:59:53,951 --> 00:59:55,811
- Come near. - Hurry!

1513
00:59:56,481 --> 00:59:59,281
- Please fail. - Yeon Jae.

1514
00:59:59,281 --> 01:00:02,381
(Yeon Jae throws her ball.)

1515
01:00:02,951 --> 01:00:05,911
- Please fail. - Yeon Jae.

1516
01:00:05,911 --> 01:00:11,151
(Now, she only needs to catch the ball.)

1517
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:20,281
(I'll show you the beautiful moves from the competitions.)

1518
01:00:21,581 --> 01:00:23,981
(She caught the ball with her legs.)

1519
01:00:25,551 --> 01:00:26,881
You're supposed to catch it with your hands.

1520
01:00:27,551 --> 01:00:29,711
- Am I wrong? - With my hands?

1521
01:00:29,711 --> 01:00:32,081
- Catch it with your hands. - With my hands?

1522
01:00:32,081 --> 01:00:34,051
My goodness.

1523
01:00:34,151 --> 01:00:36,011
Come here.

1524
01:00:36,351 --> 01:00:39,011
(Mi Sun is still trying.)

1525
01:00:39,881 --> 01:00:41,511
(She failed again.)

1526
01:00:41,511 --> 01:00:42,781
Can I try again?

1527
01:00:42,781 --> 01:00:45,381
(Is she doing this on purpose?)

1528
01:00:46,381 --> 01:00:47,881
Can I try again?

1529
01:00:47,881 --> 01:00:49,051
(Yeon Jae, go ahead.)

1530
01:00:49,051 --> 01:00:50,411
With hands?

1531
01:00:51,011 --> 01:00:52,111
- Oh my. - Yes!

1532
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,751
There you go.

1533
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:55,711
(Yeon Jae succeeded.)

1534
01:00:56,151 --> 01:00:57,581
Good job!

1535
01:00:57,581 --> 01:00:58,811
(We still have a chance.)

1536
01:00:58,911 --> 01:01:01,151
(I don't think so.)

1537
01:01:01,551 --> 01:01:03,311
(Will Mi Sun fulfil her duties as a spy?)

1538
01:01:04,081 --> 01:01:05,911
- Good job! - Continue.

1539
01:01:06,281 --> 01:01:08,081
Hurry.

1540
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,111
- Good job. - Hurry.

1541
01:01:10,211 --> 01:01:11,581
Our female warriors, good job.

1542
01:01:12,051 --> 01:01:15,511
Go ahead. You can hit me.

1543
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:17,581
Hurry!

1544
01:01:17,681 --> 01:01:18,751
Come on!

1545
01:01:18,751 --> 01:01:21,281
Hurry!

1546
01:01:21,281 --> 01:01:23,451
- What should I do? - Ready.

1547
01:01:23,451 --> 01:01:25,051
One, two, three.

1548
01:01:26,051 --> 01:01:27,351
(Screaming)

1549
01:01:29,151 --> 01:01:31,481
(Her arm is twisted.)

1550
01:01:31,481 --> 01:01:33,151
(She was forced to succeed.)

1551
01:01:33,151 --> 01:01:35,611
Are you okay?

1552
01:01:35,611 --> 01:01:37,581
Are you okay? You're done.

1553
01:01:37,581 --> 01:01:39,411
Hurry!

1554
01:01:39,411 --> 01:01:40,511
Hurry!

1555
01:01:40,581 --> 01:01:42,051
- There you go. - Hurry!

1556
01:01:42,051 --> 01:01:44,911
Hit here.

1557
01:01:45,351 --> 01:01:47,211
(She's pretending she's running as fast as she can.)

1558
01:01:47,211 --> 01:01:48,651
Go.

1559
01:01:49,151 --> 01:01:50,411
Succeed at once.

1560
01:01:52,181 --> 01:01:53,411
- There you go. - There you go.

1561
01:01:53,411 --> 01:01:55,411
(Jong Kook succeeds at once.)

1562
01:01:55,951 --> 01:01:57,551
- Hurry. - I think it'll burst.

1563
01:01:57,911 --> 01:01:59,751
Throw these.

1564
01:01:59,781 --> 01:02:00,851
Hurry!

1565
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,611
Hurry!

1566
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:04,251
You're doing great.

1567
01:02:04,381 --> 01:02:06,881
Ji Won is doing a great job.

1568
01:02:06,881 --> 01:02:08,611
- Throw them. - Let's do this!

1569
01:02:08,611 --> 01:02:11,181
(Men's Team starts throwing.)

1570
01:02:11,181 --> 01:02:12,311
It's okay.

1571
01:02:12,411 --> 01:02:13,511
Keep it up!

1572
01:02:13,951 --> 01:02:16,781
Look at that. We should aim there.

1573
01:02:16,781 --> 01:02:19,711
Aim a weak part.

1574
01:02:20,351 --> 01:02:22,051
Aim at the centre.

1575
01:02:22,051 --> 01:02:23,281
- At the centre? - Yes.

1576
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:24,481
You're doing great.

1577
01:02:24,751 --> 01:02:26,781
There you go.

1578
01:02:27,081 --> 01:02:28,751
It's driving me crazy.

1579
01:02:29,151 --> 01:02:31,611
It's opening here.

1580
01:02:31,611 --> 01:02:34,151
(They might be done soon.)

1581
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:36,711
- Aim here. - There?

1582
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:38,051
(Jae Seok points at the wrong place.)

1583
01:02:38,051 --> 01:02:39,311
- There? - Not the centre?

1584
01:02:39,311 --> 01:02:41,111
(Don't try to fool us.)

1585
01:02:41,111 --> 01:02:43,081
Where should we aim?

1586
01:02:43,081 --> 01:02:44,611
I think it's here.

1587
01:02:44,611 --> 01:02:46,451
Come near.

1588
01:02:46,611 --> 01:02:48,451
(Mi Sun seems to be working hard.)

1589
01:02:48,481 --> 01:02:49,711
I'll lower it.

1590
01:02:49,711 --> 01:02:53,011
(She's throwing at Jong Kook.)

1591
01:02:54,951 --> 01:02:56,011
(He's working so hard.)

1592
01:02:56,011 --> 01:02:58,111
It's very sturdy.

1593
01:02:58,111 --> 01:02:59,311
(You're working too hard.)

1594
01:02:59,311 --> 01:03:00,681
It's too hard.

1595
01:03:04,951 --> 01:03:06,011
(She hits Jong Kook.)

1596
01:03:06,981 --> 01:03:10,211
(Why do I feel like I'm keep getting hit?)

1597
01:03:11,911 --> 01:03:12,911
(It hits Gary.)

1598
01:03:12,911 --> 01:03:14,581
Keep going. It's about to open.

1599
01:03:14,581 --> 01:03:16,881
(She's blatantly hitting the other members.)

1600
01:03:19,011 --> 01:03:20,511
I'm sorry.

1601
01:03:20,511 --> 01:03:23,051
- Are you sure it was a mistake? - I'm sorry.

1602
01:03:23,051 --> 01:03:24,381
(I almost got caught.)

1603
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,151
Keep it up!

1604
01:03:27,581 --> 01:03:30,181
It's almost done.

1605
01:03:30,551 --> 01:03:32,351
- We're almost there. - Just a bit more.

1606
01:03:32,551 --> 01:03:35,381
(Men's Team's basket starts to break.)

1607
01:03:36,051 --> 01:03:37,711
Yes!

1608
01:03:37,711 --> 01:03:39,681
Why doesn't it burst?

1609
01:03:40,151 --> 01:03:41,811
Aim at the side.

1610
01:03:41,811 --> 01:03:43,411
Aim at the side.

1611
01:03:43,411 --> 01:03:44,651
(Which spy will win?)

1612
01:03:44,651 --> 01:03:46,381
It's done.

1613
01:03:46,611 --> 01:03:49,151
We're almost there. It's coming out!

1614
01:03:50,051 --> 01:03:51,751
(Men's Team succeeded.)

1615
01:03:51,751 --> 01:03:53,981
- We're done! - Yes!

1616
01:03:55,481 --> 01:03:57,651
(Gosh)

1617
01:03:58,951 --> 01:04:03,051
(I'm not smiling on the inside.)

1618
01:04:03,051 --> 01:04:04,111
We won!

1619
01:04:04,181 --> 01:04:06,451
(Why did I betray them?)

1620
01:04:06,451 --> 01:04:08,051
This won't break.

1621
01:04:08,051 --> 01:04:10,081
It almost broke here.

1622
01:04:10,481 --> 01:04:12,081
Yes!

1623
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:13,111
What a relief!

1624
01:04:13,111 --> 01:04:14,381
(Are you sure?)

1625
01:04:15,611 --> 01:04:17,811
(It's too bad.)

1626
01:04:18,411 --> 01:04:19,711
What a shame!

1627
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,851
(Are you sure?)

1628
01:04:21,151 --> 01:04:22,981
That was close.

1629
01:04:22,981 --> 01:04:24,181
(Betrayals are followed by regrets.)

1630
01:04:25,811 --> 01:04:27,181
(Men's Team wins "Relay Race")

1631
01:04:27,181 --> 01:04:29,651
(The two teams are tied at 200 to 200.)

1632
01:04:30,381 --> 01:04:32,411
With Men's Team...

1633
01:04:32,881 --> 01:04:35,751
winning "Relay Race", you're tied at 200 to 200.

1634
01:04:35,751 --> 01:04:37,011
We're tied.

1635
01:04:37,151 --> 01:04:38,351
Now,

1636
01:04:38,451 --> 01:04:40,611
the spies will determine the result.

1637
01:04:40,611 --> 01:04:43,651
- It's unbelievable. - It's up to the spies now.

1638
01:04:43,651 --> 01:04:44,711
Now,

1639
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,851
it's time to guess the spies.

1640
01:04:47,581 --> 01:04:49,281
(This is the final vote.)

1641
01:04:50,181 --> 01:04:52,951
(The moment of truth is here.)

1642
01:04:53,451 --> 01:04:55,211
(They start discussing.)

1643
01:04:55,251 --> 01:04:56,581
I swear, I'm not a spy.

1644
01:04:59,111 --> 01:05:01,051
(I have something to tell you.)

1645
01:05:01,051 --> 01:05:04,381
Trust me. I was a spy at first.

1646
01:05:04,581 --> 01:05:05,951
(I was a spy at first.)

1647
01:05:05,951 --> 01:05:08,451
(Min Kyung reveals her truth.)

1648
01:05:08,451 --> 01:05:11,081
(What?)

1649
01:05:11,211 --> 01:05:13,081
But I changed.

1650
01:05:13,651 --> 01:05:15,811
(She even confesses her betrayal.)

1651
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:20,151
(What is she talking about?)

1652
01:05:20,951 --> 01:05:23,111
Our team was winning at first,

1653
01:05:23,351 --> 01:05:25,051
so I changed.

1654
01:05:25,051 --> 01:05:26,081
Can you do that?

1655
01:05:26,081 --> 01:05:29,551
I could do that by ripping off Jae Seok's name tag.

1656
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:31,611
Didn't any of you see me doing that?

1657
01:05:31,611 --> 01:05:33,911
Trust me.

1658
01:05:33,981 --> 01:05:37,781
- The other spy must have no idea. - Exactly.

1659
01:05:37,951 --> 01:05:39,681
(Is that true?)

1660
01:05:40,611 --> 01:05:42,911
(Jae Seok is left alone.)

1661
01:05:43,581 --> 01:05:45,951
(This doesn't feel right.)

1662
01:05:45,951 --> 01:05:47,251
You're not suspecting me, are you?

1663
01:05:48,181 --> 01:05:50,011
(Everyone's suspecting Jae Seok.)

1664
01:05:50,011 --> 01:05:51,651
Are you?

1665
01:05:51,651 --> 01:05:53,811
Isn't it too obvious?

1666
01:05:54,381 --> 01:05:55,451
You're mistaken.

1667
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:57,181
- Come here. - I mean...

1668
01:05:57,181 --> 01:05:58,581
We've been talking about what to eat tonight.

1669
01:05:58,581 --> 01:06:01,881
You're making me look like a spy.

1670
01:06:01,881 --> 01:06:05,651
It feels like reading a mystery novel.

1671
01:06:05,851 --> 01:06:08,951
- I'm so confused. - We've decided.

1672
01:06:09,381 --> 01:06:10,581
You've decided, too, haven't you?

1673
01:06:10,811 --> 01:06:12,181
I have.

1674
01:06:12,911 --> 01:06:14,581
You have? Is he the spy?

1675
01:06:15,011 --> 01:06:16,311
For sure.

1676
01:06:16,381 --> 01:06:20,211
(Let me tell you. Jae Seok is the spy.)

1677
01:06:20,211 --> 01:06:22,481
(If they guess it right, they'll win.)

1678
01:06:22,481 --> 01:06:23,881
Is it possible to change the spy?

1679
01:06:23,881 --> 01:06:26,551
(Will they trust Min Kyung?)

1680
01:06:26,681 --> 01:06:29,211
- Jae Seok, go first. - Should I?

1681
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:30,511
If I go first,

1682
01:06:31,011 --> 01:06:32,851
I think you'll talk about me.

1683
01:06:32,851 --> 01:06:34,651
- We were talking about what to eat. - I'll go first.

1684
01:06:34,651 --> 01:06:35,651
Good luck.

1685
01:06:35,651 --> 01:06:37,711
(Jae Seok goes first.)

1686
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:41,211
Trust me. I was a spy at first,

1687
01:06:41,211 --> 01:06:42,981
but I changed.

1688
01:06:42,981 --> 01:06:47,211
(Whom will Jae Seok use to change the public opinion?)

1689
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:49,181
(Song Ji Hyo)

1690
01:06:49,181 --> 01:06:51,181
The spy doesn't know?

1691
01:06:51,181 --> 01:06:52,181
Go ahead.

1692
01:06:52,181 --> 01:06:54,951
- Should I go? - Can the spy not know?

1693
01:06:54,951 --> 01:06:57,451
- Yu Ra. Trust me. - You seem to be...

1694
01:06:57,451 --> 01:06:58,681
suspecting me.

1695
01:07:00,551 --> 01:07:03,311
(Trust me and you'll win.)

1696
01:07:04,511 --> 01:07:08,481
(Whom will Yu Ra choose?)

1697
01:07:09,451 --> 01:07:11,381
(Yu Jae Seok)

1698
01:07:11,381 --> 01:07:13,511
My goodness. What should I do?

1699
01:07:13,511 --> 01:07:15,311
Can I trust her?

1700
01:07:19,811 --> 01:07:21,881
If it was a lie, I'll be shocked.

1701
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:25,451
(She didn't trust Min Kyung.)

1702
01:07:25,451 --> 01:07:26,551
It's my gut feeling.

1703
01:07:27,081 --> 01:07:28,081
Trust me.

1704
01:07:28,081 --> 01:07:31,181
(Which team will guess the spy right and win?)

1705
01:07:32,051 --> 01:07:33,611
(All votes are in.)

1706
01:07:33,611 --> 01:07:34,911
Is that possible?

1707
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:36,611
All votes are in.

1708
01:07:36,611 --> 01:07:37,681
Who is it?

1709
01:07:37,681 --> 01:07:39,451
We'll give you 100 points if you guessed it right.

1710
01:07:39,451 --> 01:07:41,311
That's generous of you.

1711
01:07:41,881 --> 01:07:42,981
I can't wait.

1712
01:07:44,551 --> 01:07:45,711
The final score...

1713
01:07:45,711 --> 01:07:48,611
(They're tied at 200 to 200.)

1714
01:07:48,611 --> 01:07:51,511
(The vote will determine the winner.)

1715
01:07:51,511 --> 01:07:54,181
(Which team will win?)

1716
01:07:54,181 --> 01:07:56,011
The final score for Men's Team is 300...

1717
01:07:56,351 --> 01:07:57,911
and Women's Team, 200.

1718
01:07:59,681 --> 01:08:03,551
(Men's Team: 300, Women's Team: 200)

1719
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:06,711
(Did they fail to guess the spy?)

1720
01:08:07,881 --> 01:08:10,411
(I told you Jae Seok was the spy.)

1721
01:08:10,411 --> 01:08:12,451
Did we guess it right?

1722
01:08:12,451 --> 01:08:14,481
Whose name did you write?

1723
01:08:14,951 --> 01:08:15,981
Did you write my name?

1724
01:08:16,781 --> 01:08:18,881
- Did you? - I didn't write your name.

1725
01:08:19,281 --> 01:08:20,551
(They're at a loss for words.)

1726
01:08:20,551 --> 01:08:21,781
I didn't write your name.

1727
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:23,881
(Why didn't you trust me?)

1728
01:08:23,881 --> 01:08:25,251
Oh my.

1729
01:08:26,581 --> 01:08:30,811
(Yu Ra was the only one who trusted Min Kyung.)

1730
01:08:31,681 --> 01:08:36,151
(The other 3 suspected Min Kyung.)

1731
01:08:36,781 --> 01:08:39,911
(Women's Team failed to guess who the spy was.)

1732
01:08:40,351 --> 01:08:43,081
Let me tell you who the spy for Women's Team was.

1733
01:08:43,311 --> 01:08:44,751
(Bitter)

1734
01:08:45,281 --> 01:08:50,181
- It was Jae Seok. - I knew it.

1735
01:08:50,951 --> 01:08:53,351
- I told you. - Oh my.

1736
01:08:53,351 --> 01:08:55,251
(Why didn't you trust me?)

1737
01:08:55,251 --> 01:08:58,151
- I told you. - She betrayed once more.

1738
01:08:58,151 --> 01:08:59,581
Did you betray once more?

1739
01:09:00,281 --> 01:09:01,411
(Welcome to the world of betrayals.)

1740
01:09:01,411 --> 01:09:02,611
Min Kyung.

1741
01:09:02,811 --> 01:09:04,051
I can't believe you.

1742
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:06,351
You told the others to choose me, right?

1743
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,611
How could you do this to us?

1744
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:12,581
Ji Won. I told you it was him.

1745
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:16,351
- Didn't anyone else choose him? - Only Yu Ra trusted me.

1746
01:09:16,351 --> 01:09:18,611
The spies for Men's Team were...

1747
01:09:18,611 --> 01:09:20,351
(Men's Team's spies will be revealed.)

1748
01:09:21,311 --> 01:09:24,011
(Did they choose Mi Sun?)

1749
01:09:24,011 --> 01:09:26,911
- Towards the end... - I knew immediately.

1750
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,251
Who do you think it is?

1751
01:09:28,411 --> 01:09:29,851
(2 minutes before the vote)

1752
01:09:29,851 --> 01:09:31,511
(I should remain calm.)

1753
01:09:31,511 --> 01:09:34,221
Mi Sun threw the balls at us.

1754
01:09:34,221 --> 01:09:35,381
I got hit many times.

1755
01:09:36,221 --> 01:09:38,781
It gave me a hint.

1756
01:09:39,721 --> 01:09:43,151
(3 of them chose Mi Sun.)

1757
01:09:43,151 --> 01:09:47,451
(They succeeded in finding the spy.)

1758
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:50,281
The spies for Men's Team are...

1759
01:09:51,281 --> 01:09:52,311
Mi Sun...

1760
01:09:52,351 --> 01:09:54,081
- Really? - Really?

1761
01:09:54,081 --> 01:09:56,011
- You got caught. - and...

1762
01:09:56,551 --> 01:09:58,351
And Haha.

1763
01:10:00,281 --> 01:10:02,351
- Were there two? - Were there two?

1764
01:10:02,511 --> 01:10:03,581
Haha.

1765
01:10:04,381 --> 01:10:05,981
Were there two?

1766
01:10:05,981 --> 01:10:07,281
Were there two spies?

1767
01:10:08,351 --> 01:10:10,311
(How did they become comrades?)

1768
01:10:10,311 --> 01:10:11,411
What is this?

1769
01:10:11,751 --> 01:10:13,311
I choose...

1770
01:10:13,311 --> 01:10:14,911
(Mi Sun chose her comrade.)

1771
01:10:14,911 --> 01:10:16,251
(She chose Haha.)

1772
01:10:16,251 --> 01:10:17,381
Haha.

1773
01:10:17,381 --> 01:10:19,181
(She chose Haha as her fellow spy.)

1774
01:10:19,551 --> 01:10:23,681
You should make Women's Team win.

1775
01:10:23,681 --> 01:10:24,721
My goodness.

1776
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:27,481
(That's how Haha became a spy.)

1777
01:10:28,981 --> 01:10:30,651
(Now, they both failed their missions.)

1778
01:10:31,151 --> 01:10:32,951
I told you about Haha.

1779
01:10:32,951 --> 01:10:34,581
- I told you. - This is unbelievable.

1780
01:10:35,081 --> 01:10:37,451
That's why Haha kept suspecting Seok Jin.

1781
01:10:37,981 --> 01:10:39,481
I couldn't find a moment to betray.

1782
01:10:39,481 --> 01:10:41,611
We were losing the entire time.

1783
01:10:42,581 --> 01:10:45,781
(Many shared the spies' workload...)

1784
01:10:45,781 --> 01:10:48,721
(by doing horribly at the games.)

1785
01:10:49,781 --> 01:10:54,681
(He sometimes focused on the game to avoid suspicion,)

1786
01:10:54,681 --> 01:10:56,411
(but the other members were so bad.)

1787
01:10:56,411 --> 01:10:59,011
Is he a spy?

1788
01:11:01,611 --> 01:11:05,081
(Everyone is helping me.)

1789
01:11:06,681 --> 01:11:08,581
(I thought Men's Team would lose.)

1790
01:11:08,581 --> 01:11:11,451
The final winner is Men's Team.

1791
01:11:12,251 --> 01:11:14,781
Jae Seok succeeded his mission as a spy.

1792
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,451
(Hurray!)

1793
01:11:20,551 --> 01:11:22,451
Are you happy?

1794
01:11:22,851 --> 01:11:25,681
- You're terrible. - Are you that happy?

1795
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:26,751
Yeon Jae, don't get me wrong.

1796
01:11:26,751 --> 01:11:28,511
That's not it.

1797
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:30,481
I knew it.

1798
01:11:30,611 --> 01:11:33,051
Min Kyung betrayed twice and failed,

1799
01:11:33,181 --> 01:11:34,751
so she'll be penalised.

1800
01:11:34,751 --> 01:11:37,811
(Min Kyung will pay for dinner.)

1801
01:11:38,081 --> 01:11:40,281
- Amazing! - Nice!

1802
01:11:40,311 --> 01:11:44,281
Give me a call, baby, baby

1803
01:11:44,381 --> 01:11:46,221
(She's dancing to celebrate it.)

1804
01:11:46,351 --> 01:11:47,811
No one trusted her.

1805
01:11:47,951 --> 01:11:49,081
Take your prizes.

1806
01:11:49,911 --> 01:11:51,481
(Men's Team and Jae Seok win prizes.)

1807
01:11:51,681 --> 01:11:53,981
- Why do you touch it? - I'm in Men's Team.

1808
01:11:54,011 --> 01:11:55,551
- You are? - I told you.

1809
01:11:56,181 --> 01:11:58,511
- What is it? - I'll take the prize today.

1810
01:11:59,451 --> 01:12:01,451
It's a notebook.

1811
01:12:03,181 --> 01:12:04,851
They're so cute.

1812
01:12:05,481 --> 01:12:07,281
- Are you serious? - They're cute.

1813
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:09,111
- They're so cute. - They're cute.

1814
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:12,681
We'll give Jae Seok another prize for fulfilling his duties.

1815
01:12:12,681 --> 01:12:14,151
What did he do?

1816
01:12:14,151 --> 01:12:15,851
Give it to me somewhere else.

1817
01:12:15,851 --> 01:12:17,651
Seriously.

1818
01:12:18,151 --> 01:12:20,181
They're all watching.

1819
01:12:20,451 --> 01:12:22,981
- Let me see. - That's not it.

1820
01:12:22,981 --> 01:12:24,151
Are you proud?

1821
01:12:25,281 --> 01:12:26,611
That's not it.

1822
01:12:26,881 --> 01:12:29,511
Why did you give it to me here?

1823
01:12:29,751 --> 01:12:32,451
Jae Seok is the only happy one.

1824
01:12:32,451 --> 01:12:34,311
Why does he get another prize?

1825
01:12:34,311 --> 01:12:36,081
I got nothing when I won last time!

1826
01:12:36,081 --> 01:12:38,221
Today's winner was me.

1827
01:12:38,751 --> 01:12:40,081
I made it.

1828
01:12:40,221 --> 01:12:41,651
(Jong Kook is jealous.)

1829
01:12:41,651 --> 01:12:44,311
I'm 32 years old!

1830
01:12:44,311 --> 01:12:46,151
I don't have kids.

1831
01:12:46,151 --> 01:12:48,151
Give them to your kids later.

1832
01:12:48,221 --> 01:12:49,881
Should I have another kid?

1833
01:12:50,651 --> 01:12:52,051
Thank you for today.

1834
01:12:52,051 --> 01:12:53,951
(They're having dinner.)

1835
01:12:54,251 --> 01:12:55,551
Thank you, Min Kyung.

1836
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:57,221
Thank you.

1837
01:12:57,581 --> 01:12:58,951
(Happy)

1838
01:12:59,411 --> 01:13:00,681
Eat a lot.

1839
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:03,881
Why did you betray us?

1840
01:13:05,081 --> 01:13:06,611
Seok Jin can take care of himself.

1841
01:13:07,481 --> 01:13:08,811
Eat as soon as it's done.

1842
01:13:09,981 --> 01:13:11,811
Min Kyung, please pay for the food.

1843
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:14,151
Min Kyung.

1844
01:13:14,151 --> 01:13:16,081
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1845
01:13:16,221 --> 01:13:17,281
I'm sorry.

1846
01:13:17,281 --> 01:13:21,411
Give me a call, baby, baby

1847
01:13:23,011 --> 01:13:24,151
I'll order some more.

1848
01:13:24,721 --> 01:13:29,611
(She pays 735 dollars for her betrayal.)

1849
01:13:29,611 --> 01:13:31,111
This is what happens to betrayers.

1850
01:13:31,581 --> 01:13:32,651
(The receipt is being printed.)

1851
01:13:32,651 --> 01:13:33,881
Do you hear that?

1852
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:35,611
It's the sound of betrayal.

1853
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:38,081
(We thank Mi Sun, Ji Won, Yeon Jae, Min Kyung and Yu Ra.)

1854
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:40,011
(It's a fall day in 2016.)

1855
01:13:41,081 --> 01:13:42,221
(The avatars...)

1856
01:13:42,221 --> 01:13:43,681
I'm your master.

1857
01:13:44,151 --> 01:13:45,881
(will have to obey...)

1858
01:13:45,881 --> 01:13:47,611
(their masters.)

1859
01:13:48,851 --> 01:13:50,781
(Avatars and their masters)

1860
01:13:50,781 --> 01:13:52,981
(Their mysterious game starts.)

1861
01:13:53,751 --> 01:13:55,721
(My Avatar Can)

1862
01:13:56,851 --> 01:13:58,181
(With the auction,)

1863
01:13:58,181 --> 01:14:00,651
(a war among the avatars has begun.)

1864
01:14:00,651 --> 01:14:02,311
The highest bid is 61 right now.

1865
01:14:02,311 --> 01:14:03,351
(The master's order is the way and the truth.)

1866
01:14:03,351 --> 01:14:05,151
(Control your avatar...)

1867
01:14:05,151 --> 01:14:06,221
(to win the game.)

1868
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:08,651
(My Avatar Can)
