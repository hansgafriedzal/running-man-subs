1
00:00:03,851 --> 00:00:07,681
(Gary joined Running Man 7 years ago.)

2
00:00:08,121 --> 00:00:11,751
(We thought he'd be with us until the end.)

3
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:14,881
("Gary leaves Running Man to focus on his music.")

4
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:19,481
("Gary completed the last filming.")

5
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:21,821
- This is the last episode with him. - I know.

6
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:25,021
(We prepared everything for Gary to leave us without shedding tears.)

7
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:26,221
(That's what Gary thought.)

8
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:29,951
(You know we can't just let you go so easily.)

9
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:33,721
(This special farewell episode might be a little nasty.)

10
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:37,981
(A goodbye party where the members hold back their tears.)

11
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:44,951
(Will Gary really be able to leave Running Man safely?)

12
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:48,751
(At a cafe in Sinsa-dong)

13
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:56,781
(There are only 6 chairs instead of 7 which is unusual.)

14
00:00:58,151 --> 00:01:00,221
(Today is the last day with Gary.)

15
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:02,051
What's this? No one has arrived yet.

16
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:03,491
No one has.

17
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:05,651
I feel pretty depressed from the early morning.

18
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:07,821
- I've got the blues. - Let's go out!

19
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:09,351
Hello.

20
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:11,021
Hello!

21
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:14,491
Didn't you feel weird when you woke up this morning?

22
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,521
(Why are there only 6 chairs?)

23
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:20,221
(Other members also arrive at the cafe.)

24
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:26,151
(Wait.)

25
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:31,681
(She realises there are only six chairs and finds it hard to sit.)

26
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:37,581
As you all know,

27
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:41,421
- today is the last day with Gary. - I know.

28
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:43,281
From about two weeks ago,

29
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:46,721
Gary privately told all of us...

30
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:50,451
about his decision to leave Running Man.

31
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:53,021
I was going to persuade him...

32
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:56,421
before he told me the reason.

33
00:01:56,881 --> 00:02:00,881
Gary has a goal of his life which he desperately wants to achieve.

34
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:05,851
Although it's sad to let him go,

35
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:08,421
I believe that we should respect his decision.

36
00:02:08,951 --> 00:02:11,521
We couldn't help but understand him.

37
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:14,421
(We decided to let him go for his happiness.)

38
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:15,891
We should wish him happiness.

39
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:18,181
Then will the cameraman who's in charge of Gary quit as well?

40
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:20,051
(Will the cameraman who's in charge of Gary quit as well?)

41
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:22,481
- That's even sadder. - He's right.

42
00:02:22,481 --> 00:02:24,081
- Really? - Where is Gary's cameraman?

43
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:25,451
(He cried all night long.)

44
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:26,951
Will you quit, too?

45
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:29,751
I haven't given you the money gift for your wedding yet.

46
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:31,281
- Not yet? - Gosh.

47
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:32,551
He now even has a baby!

48
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:33,891
- He has a baby. - Goodness.

49
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:35,751
- I'll give you today. - How can you do that?

50
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:37,951
I'll give you today no matter what. Please tell me your account number.

51
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:39,051
I can't believe this.

52
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:41,321
Today is the last filming day with Gary.

53
00:02:42,051 --> 00:02:45,921
We pondered upon today's episode.

54
00:02:45,921 --> 00:02:48,881
We thought how we should let Gary go after seven years.

55
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:51,551
So we prepared this.

56
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:55,851
"Running Man Who Cannot Breakup and Gary Who Cannot Leave".

57
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:57,051
It's like a nasty breakup.

58
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,821
Will we take back things we gave him before?

59
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:00,981
Will Ji Hyo cry a lot today?

60
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:03,981
Gary thinks the shooting will start at three o'clock.

61
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:09,021
He's working in a studio which is 50m away from here.

62
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:15,451
You'll pay a surprise visit and carry out a secret mission.

63
00:03:15,451 --> 00:03:17,351
- What? - A secret mission?

64
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:19,321
A secret mission?

65
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:23,721
Without getting caught by Gary until the end of the race,

66
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:28,621
each member will steal an item that commemorates the time with Gary.

67
00:03:30,621 --> 00:03:32,451
Each member will steal an item.

68
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:33,521
You want us to steal something?

69
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:35,181
This is a farewell episode, isn't it?

70
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:36,481
Are you encouraging us to steal?

71
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:38,551
Yes. But...

72
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,651
(You have to satisfy a requirement.)

73
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:45,051
The item you steal must be bigger than the item previously stolen.

74
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:49,321
The role of the first runner is important.

75
00:03:49,321 --> 00:03:51,121
- Is there a fixed order? - No.

76
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:54,321
- You need to steal it secretly. - You need to be sly.

77
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:56,721
But we won't know who stole what.

78
00:03:56,721 --> 00:03:58,521
Gary's studio is located on the fifth floor.

79
00:03:58,521 --> 00:04:00,651
Fourth floor is where the box seats are located.

80
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:03,821
On the fourth floor, we'll check...

81
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:05,821
if your item is acceptable or not.

82
00:04:05,821 --> 00:04:08,621
The item must be from the studio. It is only acceptable when...

83
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:11,081
the item is carried out without Gary's interruption.

84
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:12,951
If he interrupts you from stealing,

85
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:15,421
you must compensate twice the price of the item.

86
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,151
- You must compensate him. - Excuse me?

87
00:04:17,151 --> 00:04:18,721
(Compensate Gary.)

88
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:20,051
Double the price?

89
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:22,781
We really might end up at a prison.

90
00:04:23,581 --> 00:04:27,021
Just like what Haha said, we could be handcuffed at the end.

91
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:31,021
Anyone who fails to steal until the race ends...

92
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,691
will face a crucial penalty at the end.

93
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:36,351
How can we be asked to steal on TV?

94
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:38,751
Let's just say we are stealing memories.

95
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:39,951
Something to remember Gary by.

96
00:04:40,021 --> 00:04:42,721
- We are memory hunters. - "Memory hunters"?

97
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:44,081
(Is that the best you got?)

98
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:45,321
Why? What's wrong?

99
00:04:46,281 --> 00:04:48,651
(We are ready to hunt memories.)

100
00:04:48,651 --> 00:04:50,951
This is the Rodeo street.

101
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:52,051
Yes, it is.

102
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:53,381
(They're about to meet him.)

103
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:55,381
I didn't know Gary's studio was located here.

104
00:04:55,381 --> 00:04:56,851
I didn't know, either.

105
00:04:56,851 --> 00:05:01,851
(Where are you going, Gary? We are on our way to steal.)

106
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:08,451
(You can't get off that easy. "Nameless Stealers")

107
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:12,121
All right, let's go!

108
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:14,981
This is it.

109
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,021
I had no idea. Is this it?

110
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:18,691
This must be it.

111
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:21,951
Gary's studio is tightly closed.

112
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:25,151
I can come to Gary's studio...

113
00:05:25,321 --> 00:05:27,321
and go to my dermatologist.

114
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:28,951
Jae Seok, go to my brother.

115
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:30,381
- What? - Go to him.

116
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:33,181
He is worried about your wrinkles.

117
00:05:33,181 --> 00:05:35,251
I know. What should I do?

118
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,151
(Raiding Gary's studio has just begun.)

119
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:39,521
Hello, Gary.

120
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:41,051
What were you doing?

121
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:44,651
(Did we surprise you?)

122
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,051
(The camera crew set up the perimeter in advance.)

123
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:53,421
(The staff acquired Gary's studio in a blink of an eye.)

124
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:55,951
(Who am I? Where am I?)

125
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:58,351
Gary, here is your outfit and your microphone.

126
00:05:58,351 --> 00:05:59,521
Oh, my outfit.

127
00:06:00,251 --> 00:06:02,681
Didn't you say you were coming later?

128
00:06:02,681 --> 00:06:05,151
Be honest. Don't you regret resigning?

129
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:08,181
- Don't you? - I was going to start off crying.

130
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:11,281
(Gary is changing into his outfit.)

131
00:06:11,281 --> 00:06:12,521
I'm quite sad.

132
00:06:13,421 --> 00:06:15,481
(Why are they looking around?)

133
00:06:15,481 --> 00:06:16,851
(Let's see.)

134
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:24,181
(Gary's studio has 7 years' worth of souvenirs from Running Man.)

135
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:27,421
When was this from?

136
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:28,621
Gold, silver and bronze?

137
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,381
What is this?

138
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:34,721
(Shall we get started?)

139
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:40,851
(The studio is full of small and big objects.)

140
00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:47,951
(Can they steal without Gary noticing?)

141
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:51,251
Well, today is...

142
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:54,851
- Gary's last day joining us. - You're right.

143
00:06:55,321 --> 00:07:01,821
(They shared pleasures and sorrows for 7 years.)

144
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,281
- Did you cry? - What?

145
00:07:03,821 --> 00:07:05,021
I did feel sad.

146
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:08,281
Even I felt weird this morning.

147
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:11,351
You two should sit together today.

148
00:07:11,351 --> 00:07:12,621
- That's right. - You're the Monday Couple.

149
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:14,681
Switch seats, Kwang Soo.

150
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:16,321
Ji Hyo should move there.

151
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:21,981
(As we say goodbye to Gary, we must say goodbye to Monday Couple, too.)

152
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:26,121
(Gary and Ji Hyo 6 years ago)

153
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:28,321
- Promise? - Promise.

154
00:07:28,321 --> 00:07:31,321
(From the moment they began to get to know each other...)

155
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:33,751
(until this moment as Monday Couple...)

156
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:36,651
This sea resembles you.

157
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:40,351
(They have beautiful memories to cherish together.)

158
00:07:40,351 --> 00:07:43,751
(Goodbye, Monday boyfriend.)

159
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:47,281
Ji Hyo is now shooting a drama with Sun Kyun.

160
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:50,181
She is having an affair on it.

161
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:51,551
(Jae Seok breaks the mood.)

162
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:53,981
Be the best actress specialising in having affairs on TV.

163
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:55,551
I have confidence in her.

164
00:07:55,781 --> 00:07:57,881
(Just as he wished, she became the best.)

165
00:07:57,881 --> 00:08:01,051
We deliberated a lot what to do for our last episode.

166
00:08:01,051 --> 00:08:03,681
Do you know how far you ran over the course of seven years?

167
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:05,051
- How far? - Yes.

168
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,121
- How far we ran? - The distance during filming?

169
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:09,521
If we count the time to Dubai, then it is a lot.

170
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:11,151
How far do you think we ran?

171
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:12,351
About 20,000km?

172
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:13,551
- Seok Jin. - 20,000km?

173
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:16,481
A round trip abroad should be about 10,000km.

174
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,751
- We also went to Australia. - You're right.

175
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:22,521
We calculated the total distance from the first episode.

176
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:25,281
To be accurate, it is 77,093km.

177
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:28,181
(The total distance is 77,093km.)

178
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:35,051
(The total distance outside of Korea is 43,063.17km.)

179
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:36,291
(The total distance in Korea is 33,931.83km)

180
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,251
(The accumulated distance is 77,093km)

181
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:41,721
If you count the distance I was dragged by Jong Kook...

182
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:42,881
If you count that too then...

183
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:45,881
- I bet that distance is longer. - The camera didn't catch them all.

184
00:08:46,121 --> 00:08:47,981
This brings us back to today's race.

185
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:49,921
It is "Balance the Distance".

186
00:08:49,921 --> 00:08:51,181
"Balance the Distance"?

187
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:52,881
- It rhymes. - We tried.

188
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:53,951
"Balance the Distance"?

189
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:57,421
You must collect the total distance...

190
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:59,981
that you ran during the seven years through playing various games.

191
00:09:00,021 --> 00:09:01,521
The game ends only when you have gathered all the distance.

192
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:03,321
Gary, it's going to take about five months.

193
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,451
We have to collect 77,000km.

194
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:07,681
How do we gather the kilometres?

195
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,621
The game itself is quite simple.

196
00:09:09,621 --> 00:09:11,751
You can choose one of the category.

197
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,791
The back side will tell you what kind of game to play. If you win,

198
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:16,351
you get to keep the kilometres.

199
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:19,121
But if you lose, you will have to get finger flicks.

200
00:09:20,151 --> 00:09:24,121
(Whenever the members win, they will have a chance to pick a present. )

201
00:09:24,951 --> 00:09:27,121
The faster you complete the distance,

202
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:29,521
the better the present Gary will receive.

203
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:31,421
Are these presents for me?

204
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:34,951
If you gather all the distance in one try,

205
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:37,321
he will get a round trip ticket to Europe.

206
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:39,451
If you complete the distance in two tries, he will get a new laptop.

207
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:42,481
If you finish in three tries, he'll get a premium Korean Beef package.

208
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,151
I like the last one. 15 tries or more and he has to give us presents.

209
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,651
That's meaningful.

210
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:49,051
For us, that could be more suitable.

211
00:09:49,551 --> 00:09:50,681
(Presents to the whole staff?)

212
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:53,021
That will look nicest on television.

213
00:09:53,481 --> 00:09:55,521
I mean it is also customary...

214
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:57,121
as a person who resigned.

215
00:09:58,951 --> 00:10:01,291
Please select the first category.

216
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:03,181
Let's test the water first.

217
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:04,651
Why don't we try the easy ones first?

218
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:06,921
If we finish in one try, don't I get a round trip ticket to Europe?

219
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:09,051
- Then we should try. - How about we try?

220
00:10:09,051 --> 00:10:11,221
- Yes, let's do it. - Let's go for 77,000km.

221
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:12,421
At once?

222
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:13,921
I have a question.

223
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:15,221
I have a question.

224
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,751
I have a question.

225
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:21,421
Has the game begun?

226
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,851
Yes, it has.

227
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:29,851
(Running Man's secret mission starts as well.)

228
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:35,381
(They must steal an object and bring it downstairs secretly.)

229
00:10:35,381 --> 00:10:38,921
(Can everyone succeed?)

230
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:41,151
Let's go for the whole distance.

231
00:10:41,151 --> 00:10:42,651
Let's go, let's go.

232
00:10:42,651 --> 00:10:45,421
Let's go for the one that everyone has to pass.

233
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:48,451
Gary, come on. Let's go for it.

234
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:49,721
Let's do it.

235
00:10:49,721 --> 00:10:51,681
Okay. If I get that ticket,

236
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:53,081
I'll buy a ticket for someone, too.

237
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:56,421
- Let's go. - I'll show you what it is.

238
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:59,781
(The game for 77,000km is...)

239
00:11:00,551 --> 00:11:04,051
(What is behind the board?)

240
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:05,381
"Stand the Pain"?

241
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:07,481
(Stand the Pain)

242
00:11:08,321 --> 00:11:09,681
- What is that? - What is "Stand the Pain"?

243
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:13,321
The game for completing the whole distance is...

244
00:11:14,451 --> 00:11:17,681
(Please tell us now.)

245
00:11:18,151 --> 00:11:21,221
- An expert will be joining us. - What?

246
00:11:21,621 --> 00:11:25,251
The special helper is one of the well-known therapists...

247
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:29,651
in sports message. His name is Kim Young Joon.

248
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:32,881
(I can remember it just like it was yesterday.)

249
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:40,551
(With his amazing hands, he ruled the members.)

250
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:42,551
(Sports massage therapist, Kim Young Joon)

251
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:44,681
He is here.

252
00:11:44,681 --> 00:11:46,281
(He is back to help the game.)

253
00:11:46,281 --> 00:11:47,921
- Oh my gosh. - He is really here.

254
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:49,681
- Hello. - Welcome.

255
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:51,351
I'll do it.

256
00:11:51,351 --> 00:11:52,621
I can do this.

257
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:55,051
My shoulder is tense.

258
00:11:55,051 --> 00:11:56,921
(Everyone has to stand the pain for 10 seconds without screaming.)

259
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:59,451
- Right here? - Get Ready.

260
00:12:00,381 --> 00:12:02,851
Hold on, you are using your elbow? You are not using your hands?

261
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:04,851
- Why? - It makes no difference.

262
00:12:04,851 --> 00:12:06,421
Just stand the pain.

263
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:08,921
Gary, if you scream, it's over.

264
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:11,781
- He can do it. - Get ready.

265
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:17,251
- Start. - Poor Gary.

266
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,951
You look so ugly.

267
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:21,781
(A horrible looking squid is spotted in Apgujeong.)

268
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:23,821
- He is holding it. - Time's almost up.

269
00:12:24,181 --> 00:12:26,821
You are almost there.

270
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:29,551
(With breath taking appearance)

271
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:30,621
Time's up.

272
00:12:30,621 --> 00:12:33,581
(Gary succeeds in standing the pain for 10 seconds.)

273
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,421
This is the ugliest face I've seen in 10 years.

274
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:38,621
- That was so ugly. - What did you do yesterday, Gary?

275
00:12:39,021 --> 00:12:40,881
You were shockingly ugly.

276
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:44,051
- That was something. - I can't see that face any more.

277
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:46,381
I don't want to let him go.

278
00:12:46,381 --> 00:12:47,781
Please fix me up in editing.

279
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:51,751
(Is this what you meant?)

280
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:53,181
I mean among us,

281
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:57,221
he is the only one who can be funny only with his face.

282
00:12:57,251 --> 00:12:58,381
I miss him already.

283
00:12:58,851 --> 00:13:01,521
I don't think I can stand the pain in my pelvis very well.

284
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:03,821
No, Jae Seok. You can do this.

285
00:13:03,821 --> 00:13:05,681
- I mean, pelvis is... - Jae Seok, help me out.

286
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:06,851
I can do other areas.

287
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:08,581
Jae Seok. For me, you can surely hold 10 seconds.

288
00:13:08,581 --> 00:13:10,781
- Stand the pain. - Get ready.

289
00:13:11,221 --> 00:13:12,951
Your 10 seconds start now.

290
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:14,481
(For Gary, I can sacrifice my pelvis.)

291
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:18,821
(I must stand the pain.)

292
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:20,351
(Please, Jae Seok.)

293
00:13:20,781 --> 00:13:23,321
(Clutching)

294
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:24,981
(He endured half the time.)

295
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:26,121
(Shrieking)

296
00:13:26,821 --> 00:13:27,951
(Shrieking)

297
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:31,481
(Their first attempt to complete the distance fails.)

298
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:33,751
Come on.

299
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:37,351
(Please let us know if anyone knows how to fix overly massaged pelvis.)

300
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:40,781
I thought my leg was going to fall out.

301
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:45,221
What kind of therapist are you?

302
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:49,581
Sir! My leg was about to fall off.

303
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,051
Look how my right leg got longer.

304
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:55,581
Look at this.

305
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:57,781
Look. It's gotten longer.

306
00:13:58,651 --> 00:14:01,351
- Isn't that a good thing? - I wish my legs were longer.

307
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:03,951
Look at my legs.

308
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:04,951
(There is a simple way of fixing that.)

309
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:06,351
(Let me do the other side as well.)

310
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:08,251
Can you make the other leg longer as well?

311
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:09,581
Right there.

312
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:10,881
It hurts.

313
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:11,881
(This will hurt only for a second.)

314
00:14:13,221 --> 00:14:14,381
(Resisting)

315
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:18,281
It's perfect now.

316
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:21,151
- It's a miracle. - They're exactly the same length.

317
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:22,381
That's much better.

318
00:14:22,981 --> 00:14:24,951
- Finally. - You can walk now.

319
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:26,981
- This is amazing. - You can walk now.

320
00:14:27,121 --> 00:14:29,081
- I got matching legs now. - We failed.

321
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:31,221
Is there a penalty?

322
00:14:31,481 --> 00:14:32,481
Yes.

323
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:33,481
(They blew their chance to win plane tickets to Europe.)

324
00:14:33,481 --> 00:14:36,051
You have to get finger flicked now.

325
00:14:36,051 --> 00:14:37,051
- Just one of us, right? - Yes.

326
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:39,821
The person who failed the mission should get penalised.

327
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:41,781
The person who made the sound should get flicked.

328
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:44,381
- No way. - It's Gary's last day.

329
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:46,121
- Gary should take it. - That sounds good.

330
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:48,181
(Gary wins the prize.)

331
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:49,521
- What? - Let's do it.

332
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,051
We're doing this for you.

333
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:54,281
- Just do it. - Sounds good.

334
00:14:54,281 --> 00:14:56,151
- Come on, Gary. - Just do it.

335
00:14:56,281 --> 00:14:57,681
Chances like this don't come by very often.

336
00:14:57,681 --> 00:14:58,981
Can you let me go with some dignity?

337
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,621
- What are you talking about? - This is my last day.

338
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:02,021
Which is why we have to do this.

339
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:04,351
- I'll let Ji Hyo hit me. - Are you sure about that?

340
00:15:04,351 --> 00:15:06,951
- Do it, Ji Hyo. - I'm not very good at this.

341
00:15:07,481 --> 00:15:09,551
I won't get another chance to get hit by you.

342
00:15:11,421 --> 00:15:13,981
(Okay, Gary. I'll make it quick.)

343
00:15:15,221 --> 00:15:16,221
Are you going to hit my forehead?

344
00:15:16,221 --> 00:15:17,251
Hold up.

345
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:19,051
(Frightened)

346
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,121
Did you see that?

347
00:15:20,281 --> 00:15:22,351
At least count to three before you do it.

348
00:15:22,351 --> 00:15:24,751
I didn't want to put you through that.

349
00:15:24,751 --> 00:15:26,051
(His Monday Girlfriend is sweet yet scary.)

350
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:27,621
Jong Kook?

351
00:15:29,551 --> 00:15:30,951
Hold on.

352
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:31,951
(Why is Jae Seok calling Jong Kook?)

353
00:15:31,951 --> 00:15:33,951
That's scary.

354
00:15:34,381 --> 00:15:36,581
(Moments ago)

355
00:15:36,581 --> 00:15:39,481
(Jong Kook stole a fan...)

356
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:42,781
(and sneaked out.)

357
00:15:42,781 --> 00:15:45,951
(Jae Seok noticed that.)

358
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:51,281
(I'll be holding on to that.)

359
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,581
(Jong Kook pushes him away.)

360
00:15:53,581 --> 00:15:55,281
(He gets slammed into the wall.)

361
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:57,051
What are you doing back there?

362
00:15:57,051 --> 00:15:59,581
(Jae Seok's time of ordeal)

363
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:01,581
- What are you doing? - He bumped into the wall.

364
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:03,221
Why did you do that?

365
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:05,881
It's nothing. I'm fine.

366
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,281
(What are they up to this time?)

367
00:16:07,281 --> 00:16:09,521
- What was that? - It didn't sound fine.

368
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:10,781
I'm really fine.

369
00:16:10,781 --> 00:16:12,521
- Are you sure about that? - Yes.

370
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:13,781
(They're not going easy on each other for this mission.)

371
00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:15,351
(At least Gary didn't notice anything strange.)

372
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:17,221
- Hold on. - Here I go.

373
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,321
Count to three.

374
00:16:19,321 --> 00:16:23,321
- Wait. - One, two, three.

375
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:24,781
(Slapping)

376
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:27,481
(That was loud.)

377
00:16:27,481 --> 00:16:28,981
- What was that? - Good hit.

378
00:16:29,551 --> 00:16:31,381
(Ji Hyo closes the game with a finishing home run.)

379
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:34,621
(I'll let you go now, Gary.)

380
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:37,851
(It's time to say goodbye.)

381
00:16:39,421 --> 00:16:40,951
- That was a good hit. - Did you hear that?

382
00:16:40,951 --> 00:16:43,051
- That was loud. - Are you okay?

383
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:44,381
It sounded like something blew up.

384
00:16:44,381 --> 00:16:46,051
It sounded like a plastic bag popped open.

385
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:48,281
I'm not even joking. That was really loud.

386
00:16:48,481 --> 00:16:49,751
Oh, my goodness.

387
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:52,221
- Is it red? - No, it's fine.

388
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:55,051
It hurts from the inside.

389
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:57,321
- That was a good hit. - She didn't punch me, did she?

390
00:16:57,321 --> 00:16:59,781
- That was amazing. - It's gotten red.

391
00:16:59,881 --> 00:17:01,421
Can I pick the next person in line?

392
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:02,421
Yes.

393
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,351
(You can pick the next person to get finger flicked after you get hit.)

394
00:17:04,351 --> 00:17:06,151
- What should we do next? - Please choose the next game.

395
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,351
- Let's do an easy one. - Okay.

396
00:17:08,621 --> 00:17:10,551
- We should do a hard one. - Let's do the yellow one.

397
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:11,781
We should finish it off in one go.

398
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,851
Let's do the one with 77,000km.

399
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:16,221
- Fine. - This is our chance.

400
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:18,151
We'll do 77,000km for Running Man.

401
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:19,581
Here it is.

402
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:20,581
What is it?

403
00:17:21,321 --> 00:17:28,951
(Carrying out this mission will award Gary with a laptop.)

404
00:17:30,991 --> 00:17:34,281
("Mascot")

405
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:36,051
"Mascot"?

406
00:17:36,051 --> 00:17:37,051
What is that?

407
00:17:37,051 --> 00:17:38,321
(We have a mascot?)

408
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:39,351
What is that?

409
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:42,851
For this mission,

410
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:45,051
you will be joined by Running Man's mascot.

411
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:46,491
We have a mascot?

412
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:49,581
He became the mascot of our show with just two appearances.

413
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:52,321
He's the master of sports massage, Mr Kim Young Joon.

414
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,781
What are you talking about?

415
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,281
(Are you kidding me?)

416
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:57,281
- Are you kidding me? - Are you serious?

417
00:17:57,281 --> 00:17:58,321
What do you think you're doing?

418
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:00,051
(Why you little...)

419
00:18:00,851 --> 00:18:02,781
This is nonsense.

420
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:03,781
Are you...

421
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:06,051
Are you serious?

422
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,051
I have a feeling...

423
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:08,991
everything's going to lead up to the massage.

424
00:18:08,991 --> 00:18:10,581
He's our mascot?

425
00:18:10,581 --> 00:18:11,581
(The mascot is ready.)

426
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:13,781
- I'll go. - Can you do me a favour?

427
00:18:13,781 --> 00:18:15,051
(Jong Kook volunteers to go first in order to succeed the mission.)

428
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:16,221
This is impossible.

429
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:17,451
I can't hold it in.

430
00:18:18,251 --> 00:18:19,621
Can you try some other time if you're not feeling up for it?

431
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:21,781
Let's win the laptop for Gary.

432
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:22,821
I really need it.

433
00:18:23,991 --> 00:18:27,991
(Will Jong Kook be able to endure the massive pain for Gary?)

434
00:18:27,991 --> 00:18:29,681
Ready, set, go!

435
00:18:29,681 --> 00:18:31,251
(The mascot's massage begins.)

436
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:32,851
(He seems to be in pain.)

437
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:34,251
Look at his hands.

438
00:18:34,251 --> 00:18:35,991
Look at those muscles.

439
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:37,351
(He's trying his best to hold it in.)

440
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,051
Look at his legs.

441
00:18:39,881 --> 00:18:40,881
Mission successful.

442
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:45,521
- Where are you going? - Where are you going?

443
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:46,751
(He steals something while faking the pain.)

444
00:18:47,121 --> 00:18:48,721
Where are you going?

445
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:49,991
Where is he going?

446
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:52,221
(He managed to steal something in the middle of all that.)

447
00:18:52,221 --> 00:18:53,681
Where did he go?

448
00:18:54,281 --> 00:18:57,121
(He arrives at the headquarters on the 4th floor.)

449
00:19:01,851 --> 00:19:04,521
You have successfully carried out the hidden mission.

450
00:19:04,581 --> 00:19:05,581
(Jong Kook managed to steal a toy by acting.)

451
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:08,751
(The rest of the members have to steal objects bigger than that.)

452
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:09,851
It hurts so much.

453
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:12,051
(The rest of the members have to steal objects bigger than that.)

454
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,451
- I'm going to put my palms on you. - You have to endure it, Haha.

455
00:19:14,451 --> 00:19:15,491
Go!

456
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:16,491
(Haha is up next.)

457
00:19:16,491 --> 00:19:18,821
There you go, Haha.

458
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,221
- You're almost there. - Oh, my.

459
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:22,991
- Look how ugly he is. - You're almost there.

460
00:19:22,991 --> 00:19:24,121
(Ugliness alert.)

461
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,281
And you called me ugly for all these seven years.

462
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:27,321
Mission successful.

463
00:19:27,321 --> 00:19:28,491
(Haha succeeds.)

464
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,851
- Where are you going? - Where are you going?

465
00:19:30,881 --> 00:19:32,151
Where is everyone going?

466
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,621
It hurts so much.

467
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,051
(He arrives at the headquarters.)

468
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,581
- Hello, Haha. - I didn't know it was that big.

469
00:19:39,851 --> 00:19:42,351
That's the object Jong Kook brought.

470
00:19:42,351 --> 00:19:43,781
Why is it so big?

471
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:46,181
That's too small. You have failed the hidden mission.

472
00:19:46,181 --> 00:19:48,951
- Please bring something else. - But how?

473
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:50,151
(How did you do that, Jong Kook?)

474
00:19:50,751 --> 00:19:52,281
Where's everyone going?

475
00:19:52,851 --> 00:19:55,151
- It hurts so much. - I guess it's that painful.

476
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:56,151
It really hurts.

477
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:57,221
(Ji Hyo tries next.)

478
00:19:57,221 --> 00:19:59,491
What was that?

479
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:00,491
Don't forget you're a celebrity.

480
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,251
(What was that gesture just now?)

481
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:04,991
- What are you doing? - Control yourself.

482
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,251
- Are you crazy? - She's gone out of her mind.

483
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:07,881
(She gets sent off by disorderly conduct charges.)

484
00:20:07,881 --> 00:20:08,881
Are you crazy?

485
00:20:09,281 --> 00:20:10,521
- What was that? - Why did you do that?

486
00:20:10,881 --> 00:20:11,991
Why did you do that?

487
00:20:12,621 --> 00:20:14,181
- What are you doing? - Are you crazy?

488
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:16,251
- Why did you do that? - Are you out of your mind?

489
00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:18,851
- What was that? - She's gone mad.

490
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,351
- She's out of her mind. - What's wrong with everyone today?

491
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,381
(What's wrong with her?)

492
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:23,151
Get it together.

493
00:20:23,151 --> 00:20:24,881
We should run her through a dope test.

494
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:26,581
Sit down.

495
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:28,151
- I wanted to go. - Everyone's gone mad.

496
00:20:28,151 --> 00:20:29,751
I think I can endure the pain.

497
00:20:29,751 --> 00:20:31,581
- I'll try really hard. - Give it a try.

498
00:20:31,581 --> 00:20:33,381
- Okay. - Can I put something in my mouth?

499
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:35,351
You can't do that.

500
00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:37,021
Ready.

501
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:38,881
It's 10 seconds. Set...

502
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:40,081
Can someone else go first?

503
00:20:41,121 --> 00:20:42,381
(He didn't even get started and is already in pain.)

504
00:20:42,381 --> 00:20:44,521
- Man up. - He didn't even get started.

505
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:46,851
- Ready, - I didn't even get started.

506
00:20:46,851 --> 00:20:48,381
set, go!

507
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:49,381
(Seok Jin gives it a try.)

508
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:51,921
There you go.

509
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:54,121
(Whimpering)

510
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:56,421
- He just made a sound. - You failed.

511
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,281
That's too harsh.

512
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:00,421
You failed.

513
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:02,521
(I guess I'll just buy my own laptop.)

514
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:04,151
Seok Jin has failed the mission.

515
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:07,151
(Seok Jin lets out a groan and they fail the game.)

516
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:08,581
The next prize is highest quality of Korean beef.

517
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:11,151
- Gary loves meat. - Korean beef isn't bad.

518
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:14,251
We should pick more carefully. I don't want that person again.

519
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:15,381
I think we're safe now.

520
00:21:15,381 --> 00:21:17,451
I doubt he's going to be in the next game.

521
00:21:17,881 --> 00:21:19,221
Let's do "Staff Members".

522
00:21:19,281 --> 00:21:21,321
- Okay. - Let's do that.

523
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,881
- Please turn it over. - Is it him again?

524
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,251
I doubt it.

525
00:21:25,321 --> 00:21:26,421
- "Writers"? - "Writers".

526
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:28,991
It's a different one.

527
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:30,221
(That's such a relief.)

528
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:33,521
The keyword for this game of 77,000km is "Writers".

529
00:21:33,521 --> 00:21:35,751
(Is it a game against the writers?)

530
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:39,251
The writers arranged a sports massage session.

531
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:42,681
(It's a game of extreme pain again.)

532
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:43,851
I told you.

533
00:21:44,491 --> 00:21:46,951
- I knew this would happen. - Are you kidding me?

534
00:21:46,951 --> 00:21:48,351
(This just in. The massage therapist joins Running Man as a new member.)

535
00:21:48,351 --> 00:21:50,481
You should just take a seat with us.

536
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,381
Come sit over here.

537
00:21:52,381 --> 00:21:54,251
I told you this would happen.

538
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:56,621
This is Gary's last day.

539
00:21:56,621 --> 00:21:58,951
Can't you just let me go in peace?

540
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:01,121
This is too harsh.

541
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,381
Wait, nobody got finger flicked for the second mission.

542
00:22:03,381 --> 00:22:04,981
Why would you bring that up? You can go if you'd like.

543
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:06,221
(Do you want to get your forehead checked out?)

544
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:09,421
Gary's person of choice will get finger flicked.

545
00:22:09,421 --> 00:22:11,081
Can't we just decide by rock-paper-scissors?

546
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:13,821
I'll pick Ji Hyo.

547
00:22:13,981 --> 00:22:14,981
Ji Hyo?

548
00:22:15,981 --> 00:22:17,421
- Sounds good. - It's about time.

549
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:18,421
(It's better to get it over with as early as possible.)

550
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,481
Ji Hyo has a big forehead.

551
00:22:19,481 --> 00:22:21,481
It's better to just get it over with.

552
00:22:21,481 --> 00:22:22,951
Ji Hyo is good at taking it.

553
00:22:22,951 --> 00:22:25,021
Ji Hyo's forehead is as big as a newly developed town.

554
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:27,181
- Her forehead is big. - Let Kwang Soo do the honour.

555
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:28,221
Okay.

556
00:22:28,351 --> 00:22:29,381
Me?

557
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:30,681
(Kwang Soo is the best person fit for the job.)

558
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:32,081
Just know that you're going next,

559
00:22:32,521 --> 00:22:34,151
and I'll be the one to hit you.

560
00:22:34,381 --> 00:22:36,721
- That's fine. - Fine by me.

561
00:22:37,221 --> 00:22:38,221
Okay.

562
00:22:38,581 --> 00:22:40,521
I'll knock you out so you won't ever get back up.

563
00:22:40,851 --> 00:22:42,121
- You won't be able to hit me. - That's the spirit.

564
00:22:42,621 --> 00:22:43,751
There you go.

565
00:22:43,751 --> 00:22:46,321
(It's a battle of finger flicks between Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo.)

566
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:48,181
His hand is bigger than her face.

567
00:22:49,581 --> 00:22:51,081
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

568
00:22:51,381 --> 00:22:52,381
Just do it.

569
00:22:52,381 --> 00:22:53,481
(It's a hit.)

570
00:22:54,621 --> 00:22:56,151
(He high-fived her forehead.)

571
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:58,381
That looked hilarious, Ji Hyo.

572
00:22:58,381 --> 00:22:59,681
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

573
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:01,421
- I couldn't help it. - It'll look funny on television.

574
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,551
- Are you okay, Ji Hyo? - I couldn't help it.

575
00:23:03,781 --> 00:23:06,081
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

576
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:07,221
I understand.

577
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:08,481
I see how it is.

578
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:10,151
- We have to succeed. - I get it.

579
00:23:10,721 --> 00:23:11,851
I'm begging you.

580
00:23:11,851 --> 00:23:12,951
(We have to put an end to this.)

581
00:23:13,781 --> 00:23:15,481
Who's next?

582
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:17,481
- Did you get your waist massaged? - I'll take the massage.

583
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:19,281
I'm so scared.

584
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:21,081
(I need the teddy bear by my side.)

585
00:23:21,081 --> 00:23:22,781
- I'm so scared. - How old are you?

586
00:23:22,881 --> 00:23:24,581
- I'm too scared. - Look at him.

587
00:23:24,581 --> 00:23:26,881
- Don't do this. - Let go of me. I'm scared.

588
00:23:26,881 --> 00:23:28,681
- What are you doing? - Let go of me.

589
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:30,851
- Hand it over. - Goodness.

590
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:32,621
You don't need to hold on to that.

591
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:35,151
Can you give it back? I'm so scared.

592
00:23:35,151 --> 00:23:37,181
I'll be by your side.

593
00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:38,381
Do you feel better now?

594
00:23:38,521 --> 00:23:40,481
- A giraffe is here. - He's better than a teddy bear.

595
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:41,721
A giraffe is better.

596
00:23:41,881 --> 00:23:44,351
Ready, set, go!

597
00:23:44,951 --> 00:23:47,051
(Haha is holding onto Kwang Soo.)

598
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:50,681
(Let's do this for Gary and his Korean beef.)

599
00:23:51,151 --> 00:23:52,721
(It's painful.)

600
00:23:53,081 --> 00:23:54,181
Haha didn't make it, either.

601
00:23:54,521 --> 00:23:55,651
He failed.

602
00:23:57,281 --> 00:23:59,381
How come you can't tolerate it?

603
00:23:59,381 --> 00:24:01,751
(Sorry, Gary. I tried.)

604
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:04,851
It's a perfect forehead to hit because it's flat.

605
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:06,651
This is a great forehead to hit.

606
00:24:07,051 --> 00:24:08,081
- I'll go like this. - Okay.

607
00:24:08,451 --> 00:24:09,781
Her temper is...

608
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:13,451
(She slaps hard.)

609
00:24:14,221 --> 00:24:16,121
(His skull might be split.)

610
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:19,151
You were in the air for a moment.

611
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:23,581
(This smashing makes him go against gravity.)

612
00:24:23,851 --> 00:24:25,181
I knew she would smash him.

613
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:27,121
You are really good at hitting.

614
00:24:28,651 --> 00:24:30,181
It's not easy to hit like that.

615
00:24:30,181 --> 00:24:32,051
She's frightening.

616
00:24:32,051 --> 00:24:33,151
That was strong.

617
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:36,621
Jae Seok, why are you taking this?

618
00:24:36,821 --> 00:24:39,221
Let go of this bear.

619
00:24:39,251 --> 00:24:40,621
Haha, come back.

620
00:24:40,751 --> 00:24:42,181
- She was not kidding. - We have to shoot.

621
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:44,251
- I can't believe it. - You come here, too.

622
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:45,951
Wait a second.

623
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:47,521
Go over there.

624
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:49,321
(They're stopping each other.)

625
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,781
- This is unbelievable. - Kwang Soo, come here.

626
00:24:50,881 --> 00:24:52,981
- You tried three times so far. - Yes.

627
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:55,381
Please choose the next challenge.

628
00:24:55,381 --> 00:24:57,721
- Let's choose 50,000km. - We'll pick 50,000km.

629
00:24:57,721 --> 00:24:59,281
- 50,000km. - Isn't it the therapist again?

630
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:00,451
Let's choose 30,000km.

631
00:25:00,451 --> 00:25:01,651
- Is it a notebook, then? - 70,000km...

632
00:25:01,651 --> 00:25:03,321
- 50,000 and a pass of everyone. - Shall we shake the shoes off?

633
00:25:03,321 --> 00:25:05,981
- 50,000... - And a pass of everyone.

634
00:25:05,981 --> 00:25:07,051
Turn that around, please.

635
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:10,551
("Hit or Miss")

636
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:12,481
- It's "Hit or Miss". - That's good.

637
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:13,881
- This is good. - I like it.

638
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:15,451
- Great. - We can manage this.

639
00:25:15,451 --> 00:25:17,421
We can do this.

640
00:25:17,421 --> 00:25:20,521
The game for 50,000km is...

641
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:22,951
"Hit or Miss".

642
00:25:23,051 --> 00:25:24,651
"Hit or Miss" is not bad.

643
00:25:24,651 --> 00:25:26,281
- It depends on the luck. - Right.

644
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:27,981
What will it be?

645
00:25:27,981 --> 00:25:29,681
(Suspicious plates are coming in.)

646
00:25:29,781 --> 00:25:32,021
I think these are foods that contain wasabi or something.

647
00:25:32,021 --> 00:25:33,721
- They might be. - Are they dumplings?

648
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:36,181
- They look like foods, right? - We need to pass this.

649
00:25:36,321 --> 00:25:37,951
- Jae Seok, - Jae Seok.

650
00:25:37,951 --> 00:25:39,221
- come here and look at these. - Jae Seok.

651
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:40,581
- Over here. - Jae Seok.

652
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,681
- I'm going to the restroom. - The restroom is that way.

653
00:25:45,081 --> 00:25:46,721
(He heads for the restroom...)

654
00:25:46,721 --> 00:25:48,851
(but suddenly starts to crawl.)

655
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,281
(He bumps into the staff.)

656
00:25:53,821 --> 00:25:55,651
(He steals something.)

657
00:25:57,281 --> 00:26:00,451
(He acquired the frame among the staff.)

658
00:26:02,621 --> 00:26:03,951
- Hello. - Hello.

659
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:08,781
This should be bigger than Jong Kook's item over there.

660
00:26:08,781 --> 00:26:10,051
It's bigger, isn't it?

661
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:13,081
(The frame is slightly bigger than the figurine.)

662
00:26:13,081 --> 00:26:15,881
Jae Seok, your secret mission is cleared.

663
00:26:15,881 --> 00:26:19,021
(Jae Seok is the 2nd one to clear the secret mission.)

664
00:26:19,681 --> 00:26:21,781
- Let me explain the rule. - Okay.

665
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:24,751
The game of 50,000km is " Hit or Miss".

666
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:28,781
The mission will be cleared if everyone passes.

667
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:33,021
There are seven levels of them. So you should think about the order.

668
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:36,121
It's obvious.

669
00:26:36,181 --> 00:26:38,151
- It's coke. - Okay.

670
00:26:38,481 --> 00:26:40,151
- Next. - Great.

671
00:26:41,281 --> 00:26:42,321
It'll be difficult from now on.

672
00:26:43,021 --> 00:26:44,451
- I can't distinguish them. - I can't, either.

673
00:26:44,921 --> 00:26:46,321
I hate this.

674
00:26:46,551 --> 00:26:48,081
I even hate regular yogurt, too.

675
00:26:48,081 --> 00:26:50,051
- Why? - For it contains too much sugar.

676
00:26:50,051 --> 00:26:51,321
Just drink it.

677
00:26:51,821 --> 00:26:53,721
- Gosh. - What is the other one?

678
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:55,621
(He is very cautious.)

679
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:56,721
This one is yogurt.

680
00:26:56,851 --> 00:26:58,351
This one is real. The colour of that one is too light.

681
00:26:58,351 --> 00:26:59,981
(He's hesitating for several minutes.)

682
00:27:01,421 --> 00:27:05,721
- It's the colour of real yogurt. - Okay.

683
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:07,021
(He finally picks one.)

684
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:08,251
- I think this is... - Here he goes.

685
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:09,851
- He's drinking. - This looks real.

686
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:16,051
(We didn't deduct the distance at all. We have to succeed.)

687
00:27:17,621 --> 00:27:18,721
(He's drinking it very well.)

688
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,251
It looks okay. Are you okay?

689
00:27:21,051 --> 00:27:23,051
(He finishes in one go.)

690
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:25,221
It's delicious.

691
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:27,421
I smell vinegar.

692
00:27:28,421 --> 00:27:29,851
(He tried to hide it but failed.)

693
00:27:29,851 --> 00:27:31,121
My goodness.

694
00:27:31,121 --> 00:27:32,321
The other was the real one.

695
00:27:33,021 --> 00:27:34,481
He smells of vinegar a lot.

696
00:27:34,481 --> 00:27:35,581
We were right.

697
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:37,451
You picked the wrong one.

698
00:27:37,451 --> 00:27:38,921
You recommended this.

699
00:27:39,521 --> 00:27:40,981
(Sneakily)

700
00:27:41,781 --> 00:27:44,351
(The hunters start to move again.)

701
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:45,751
You still smell like vinegar.

702
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,981
(They hide the stolen item under their shirts.)

703
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:53,681
Gosh. You're so mean.

704
00:27:53,681 --> 00:27:54,881
You put too much of wasabi.

705
00:27:55,851 --> 00:27:57,421
Have you given us these kind of foods?

706
00:27:57,651 --> 00:27:58,651
You could have put just a little.

707
00:27:58,651 --> 00:28:00,321
Is this what we used to eat?

708
00:28:00,321 --> 00:28:01,381
What are you doing, Seok Jin?

709
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:03,781
That explains why my family said they hated my smell.

710
00:28:05,321 --> 00:28:07,181
It's a failure. We'll clean them up.

711
00:28:07,181 --> 00:28:08,481
(Haha hid the frame under his shirt.)

712
00:28:08,481 --> 00:28:09,621
(I need to go downstairs.)

713
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,481
I should have made a better choice.

714
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,251
The next step would have been a raw egg.

715
00:28:14,951 --> 00:28:16,221
What is this?

716
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:21,381
(He comes out of the room.)

717
00:28:22,021 --> 00:28:25,021
(Great. I looked natural.)

718
00:28:25,151 --> 00:28:26,851
Nobody noticed this.

719
00:28:27,351 --> 00:28:29,021
This is Jae Seok's item.

720
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:31,321
- When did he bring it? - This is the new standard.

721
00:28:31,321 --> 00:28:32,321
(When did he bring that?)

722
00:28:32,321 --> 00:28:34,221
- Haha, you cleared the mission. - Yes.

723
00:28:34,221 --> 00:28:37,251
(Haha cleared the secret mission.)

724
00:28:37,751 --> 00:28:40,481
I think Gary will have to give gifts to 100 people.

725
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:43,881
Gary might give apples again to 100 staff members.

726
00:28:43,881 --> 00:28:45,351
(They keep searching for items.)

727
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:47,481
Is this what you can wear?

728
00:28:48,051 --> 00:28:49,181
Are you going to study English?

729
00:28:49,181 --> 00:28:50,181
(Gary doesn't notice anything.)

730
00:28:50,181 --> 00:28:52,651
- I'm looking around. - Why don't you learn from Mike?

731
00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:59,051
(Seok Jin sneaks out of the room.)

732
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:02,581
You should bring something definitely bigger than this.

733
00:29:04,821 --> 00:29:06,981
(Why is his belly bulging?)

734
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:09,121
I'm worried about the next person.

735
00:29:11,351 --> 00:29:14,021
(He brought a big one.)

736
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:15,021
What should the next person do?

737
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:17,381
- It should be wider, too. - Wider, too?

738
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,751
This is what Haha brought.

739
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:22,181
- Should it be wider, too? - It should be obviously bigger.

740
00:29:22,451 --> 00:29:23,921
- I thought the height is important. - We measure...

741
00:29:23,921 --> 00:29:26,051
We measure the width, too.

742
00:29:26,321 --> 00:29:27,351
The opinion of the staff is...

743
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:29,281
(He brought a huge one.)

744
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:30,651
Did you bring this?

745
00:29:30,651 --> 00:29:31,681
(This is big enough to cover any frame.)

746
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:32,681
Hey, you.

747
00:29:32,681 --> 00:29:34,121
Don't you think of the rest of us?

748
00:29:35,351 --> 00:29:37,121
Compare them.

749
00:29:37,421 --> 00:29:39,421
- You should think... - It can cover this.

750
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:40,881
Kwang Soo, you cleared the secret mission.

751
00:29:40,881 --> 00:29:43,181
(Kwang Soo's ability to steal is amazing.)

752
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,521
Are you crazy?

753
00:29:44,881 --> 00:29:46,681
How could you bring this one?

754
00:29:46,681 --> 00:29:49,821
Now, Kwang Soo's item is the standard.

755
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:51,751
How can I bring anything bigger than this?

756
00:29:52,551 --> 00:29:56,381
(Ji Hyo and Seok Jin are the ones left.)

757
00:29:57,151 --> 00:29:58,521
(It's getting harder for the two.)

758
00:29:58,521 --> 00:30:00,881
- Shall we start? - Let's start shooting again.

759
00:30:01,351 --> 00:30:03,481
- Let's do "Hit or Miss" once more. - Good.

760
00:30:03,481 --> 00:30:04,851
- Okay. - Let's do it.

761
00:30:04,951 --> 00:30:06,351
Before that, someone has to get finger flicked.

762
00:30:06,351 --> 00:30:07,581
(You should get finger flicked.)

763
00:30:07,581 --> 00:30:09,451
- Can I appoint someone? - Yes, you can.

764
00:30:09,451 --> 00:30:10,821
It's been a while since Jong Kook got it last time.

765
00:30:10,821 --> 00:30:13,981
(Jong Kook, could you come up?)

766
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:15,121
It sounds good.

767
00:30:15,451 --> 00:30:16,781
The sound is great.

768
00:30:16,951 --> 00:30:19,521
- Who can hit him? - He still has to be hit.

769
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,351
(I'll see how hard you hit me.)

770
00:30:21,351 --> 00:30:24,181
Ji Hyo is doing well today. What about her?

771
00:30:24,181 --> 00:30:26,081
- Okay. - Ji Hyo is great.

772
00:30:26,081 --> 00:30:27,951
- I can't since I'm busy. - What about Kwang Soo?

773
00:30:28,321 --> 00:30:30,451
- Let Kwang Soo hit him. - May I?

774
00:30:31,051 --> 00:30:34,281
Jae Seok is really good at slapping.

775
00:30:34,281 --> 00:30:35,381
- It's okay. - Can I?

776
00:30:35,621 --> 00:30:37,481
Are you worried about next time?

777
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:38,851
I feel sorry.

778
00:30:39,021 --> 00:30:40,381
- We're worried. - That's why.

779
00:30:40,981 --> 00:30:41,981
Then...

780
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:43,751
- let's play rock-paper-scissors. - I want to appoint...

781
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:44,951
- someone. - Let's play...

782
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:46,121
rock-paper-scissors.

783
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:47,751
- No. - If you appoint someone...

784
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:50,481
- I can appoint someone who'll slap. - No.

785
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,981
You just appointed the one who will be slapped.

786
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:55,121
(Is she cleaning up for me?)

787
00:30:55,381 --> 00:30:57,481
- You mean I should hit him? - Yes.

788
00:30:58,251 --> 00:30:59,881
(Well, then...)

789
00:30:59,881 --> 00:31:01,021
Then I want to hit you.

790
00:31:01,021 --> 00:31:03,081
(I just want to hit you.)

791
00:31:03,081 --> 00:31:04,181
Why?

792
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:07,081
Then let's play rock-paper-scissors among the rest of us.

793
00:31:07,351 --> 00:31:09,051
- Among the rest? - The loser will hit him.

794
00:31:09,051 --> 00:31:10,681
People who didn't hit yet has to play it.

795
00:31:10,681 --> 00:31:12,421
- The loser is the hitter. - Okay.

796
00:31:12,421 --> 00:31:13,481
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

797
00:31:15,921 --> 00:31:17,081
Okay.

798
00:31:17,081 --> 00:31:20,281
(Haha has to hit Jong Kook's forehead.)

799
00:31:21,851 --> 00:31:23,051
He's good at this.

800
00:31:23,051 --> 00:31:25,081
- He is. - He shouldn't get hurt.

801
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:26,451
He won't get hurt.

802
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:29,051
He has to perform in Vegas.

803
00:31:29,051 --> 00:31:30,981
You mean the concert in Las Vegas?

804
00:31:31,351 --> 00:31:32,881
- The concert in Las Vegas? - Yes.

805
00:31:33,681 --> 00:31:35,381
- On November 19? - Yes.

806
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:37,651
(He promotes his concert suddenly.)

807
00:31:37,651 --> 00:31:39,481
- What are you doing? - This won't be aired.

808
00:31:39,581 --> 00:31:41,681
What's wrong with mentioning my concert?

809
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:43,481
Leave your hand mark.

810
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:44,951
(He has to slap Jong Kook anyway.)

811
00:31:44,951 --> 00:31:46,021
It's okay to get slapped in the face.

812
00:31:47,051 --> 00:31:50,451
But he hits the eyes. He can't aim properly.

813
00:31:51,281 --> 00:31:52,751
(Slapping)

814
00:31:54,251 --> 00:31:55,981
See? He hits the eyes.

815
00:31:57,781 --> 00:31:59,351
He usually hits the eyes.

816
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:00,921
I was hit by the eyes last time.

817
00:32:01,251 --> 00:32:02,681
He can't aim well.

818
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:03,981
You should have adjusted the spot.

819
00:32:04,551 --> 00:32:06,281
(Just think about the concert, Jong Kook.)

820
00:32:06,281 --> 00:32:07,421
This is funny.

821
00:32:07,921 --> 00:32:09,251
The next person is doomed.

822
00:32:11,821 --> 00:32:13,051
I don't feel confident about this.

823
00:32:13,051 --> 00:32:14,051
(Seok Jin is trying a new game.)

824
00:32:14,051 --> 00:32:15,121
I'll put them anywhere.

825
00:32:15,121 --> 00:32:16,251
- As many as possible. - Oh my.

826
00:32:17,321 --> 00:32:18,481
(It pops out.)

827
00:32:19,621 --> 00:32:21,781
(Seok Jin sure is unlucky.)

828
00:32:21,781 --> 00:32:24,081
- I'm sorry. - You're so bad at games.

829
00:32:24,281 --> 00:32:25,351
Sit down.

830
00:32:26,381 --> 00:32:27,981
(Are you talking to me?)

831
00:32:27,981 --> 00:32:29,081
Is it me?

832
00:32:30,121 --> 00:32:31,551
He must be scared.

833
00:32:31,551 --> 00:32:32,851
You could have said nicely.

834
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:34,921
You should have said nicely.

835
00:32:35,481 --> 00:32:37,681
He ordered him to sit down.

836
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:40,781
- Hit me within three seconds. - Okay.

837
00:32:40,781 --> 00:32:42,621
- I'll hold you. - Gosh.

838
00:32:44,151 --> 00:32:45,351
Does it have to be me?

839
00:32:45,721 --> 00:32:47,451
It was Haha who hit you.

840
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:48,721
I can't hit Haha...

841
00:32:48,721 --> 00:32:52,921
because we'll perform in Las Vegas.

842
00:32:53,351 --> 00:32:55,851
It is on November 19, isn't it?

843
00:32:57,181 --> 00:32:58,851
(You know it very well.)

844
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,221
- Give me a break. - Get up.

845
00:33:00,221 --> 00:33:01,621
- Okay. - Come over here.

846
00:33:01,621 --> 00:33:03,521
(He wants Jae Seok instead.)

847
00:33:04,351 --> 00:33:06,381
- This is not fair. - It's not.

848
00:33:06,981 --> 00:33:08,981
- It's not fair at all. - Sit down.

849
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:11,751
What a relief.

850
00:33:11,751 --> 00:33:13,821
- I'm dumbfounded. - Words saved him.

851
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:15,781
- I'm at a loss. - Words are important.

852
00:33:15,781 --> 00:33:17,821
I'm at a loss for words.

853
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:19,581
- You can't do this. - Sit down.

854
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,121
(Though he's upset, he reveals his forehead.)

855
00:33:21,351 --> 00:33:23,581
- Take off your glasses. - I heard you have guests, too.

856
00:33:24,621 --> 00:33:25,681
Goodness.

857
00:33:25,681 --> 00:33:27,251
They're Turbo and Skull, right?

858
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:28,251
Get up.

859
00:33:28,251 --> 00:33:30,251
(Correct. Get up.)

860
00:33:31,421 --> 00:33:33,281
(Kwang Soo, come here.)

861
00:33:33,281 --> 00:33:34,281
Me?

862
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:36,321
- I was hit just a moment ago. - Sit down.

863
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,221
- Isn't it too soon? - No.

864
00:33:38,281 --> 00:33:40,851
- He can't cancel his decision. - Sit up straight.

865
00:33:41,381 --> 00:33:42,381
Sit up straight.

866
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:45,681
Put your knees together.

867
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:47,081
(He got high-quality information.)

868
00:33:47,281 --> 00:33:49,451
Isn't she lovely

869
00:33:49,551 --> 00:33:50,721
What's that?

870
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:51,851
Why did you sing that?

871
00:33:52,021 --> 00:33:53,481
Isn't Stevie Wonder also invited?

872
00:33:54,051 --> 00:33:56,021
- Get ready. - What?

873
00:33:56,221 --> 00:33:58,121
- You said Stevie Wonder is coming. - When?

874
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:00,451
- You said so. - That's nonsense.

875
00:34:00,451 --> 00:34:02,881
- Kwang Soo is a fraud. - He said Stevie Wonder is coming.

876
00:34:02,881 --> 00:34:04,821
He's a fraud.

877
00:34:04,951 --> 00:34:07,391
Haha said Stevie Wonder is invited to the performance.

878
00:34:07,391 --> 00:34:09,321
- Gary told you that. - It was Gary.

879
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:10,821
Gary has no idea about the performance.

880
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:12,551
I didn't know, either.

881
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,921
I thought Haha whispered to me.

882
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:16,081
- It was a fraud. - Gary wants to see Stevie Wonder.

883
00:34:16,081 --> 00:34:17,421
You lost my trust.

884
00:34:17,421 --> 00:34:19,081
Get ready and lift your chin.

885
00:34:19,451 --> 00:34:21,421
Lift your chin and clench your jaws.

886
00:34:21,421 --> 00:34:24,021
He resembles the mascot of a baseball team.

887
00:34:24,391 --> 00:34:25,551
(Discovery of a new character)

888
00:34:25,551 --> 00:34:26,821
What did you say?

889
00:34:26,851 --> 00:34:28,651
I don't look like a mascot.

890
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:31,351
- You do. - I don't look like that.

891
00:34:31,751 --> 00:34:34,851
You might get a chance to throw the first ball in the opening game.

892
00:34:34,851 --> 00:34:37,051
I'm sorry, but I'm not a fan of that team.

893
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:41,421
Even if you aren't, you look like the mascot of that team.

894
00:34:41,421 --> 00:34:43,921
- You can't change your looks. - You look like that mascot.

895
00:34:43,921 --> 00:34:45,821
Get ready, Kwang Soo.

896
00:34:46,021 --> 00:34:47,481
Gosh.

897
00:34:47,481 --> 00:34:49,021
(Kwang Soo is in trouble.)

898
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:50,551
It's going to hurt a lot.

899
00:34:50,551 --> 00:34:52,121
(Slap)

900
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:55,521
(He gets thrown to the ground.)

901
00:34:55,621 --> 00:34:57,621
- That was such a hard slap. - Kwang Soo.

902
00:34:58,021 --> 00:34:59,081
Kwang Soo.

903
00:34:59,121 --> 00:35:01,321
- Is it okay to air this? - Kwang Soo.

904
00:35:01,321 --> 00:35:02,651
Breathe.

905
00:35:03,781 --> 00:35:06,521
His face turned completely red.

906
00:35:06,581 --> 00:35:08,321
(Gary, why did you lie to me?)

907
00:35:08,321 --> 00:35:09,751
Kwang Soo, it's okay.

908
00:35:11,051 --> 00:35:12,391
Let's move on.

909
00:35:12,391 --> 00:35:14,681
- Gosh, nothing is working out. - This is too difficult.

910
00:35:14,681 --> 00:35:16,521
Let's try the category, "Staff Members"

911
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:18,121
- Okay. - Shall we?

912
00:35:18,121 --> 00:35:20,121
- Let's pick 50,000km. - Okay.

913
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,451
This is "Staff Members" for 50,000km.

914
00:35:22,451 --> 00:35:23,851
"VJ"?

915
00:35:23,851 --> 00:35:25,281
("VJ")

916
00:35:25,281 --> 00:35:26,421
What's that?

917
00:35:26,981 --> 00:35:30,351
It'd better not be a massage therapist the VJ picks again.

918
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,581
That means you want to start a war.

919
00:35:32,581 --> 00:35:36,681
The game for 50,000km is a race with the staff.

920
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:38,281
- A race? - How's that possible?

921
00:35:38,281 --> 00:35:40,551
Pick three members from each team.

922
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:43,481
The 1st runner climbs up from 1st to 5th floor.

923
00:35:43,481 --> 00:35:44,981
The next runner comes down from 5th to 1st floor.

924
00:35:44,981 --> 00:35:46,751
- Gary should run. - From the fifth floor?

925
00:35:46,751 --> 00:35:48,221
We can win this.

926
00:35:48,221 --> 00:35:49,581
This is quite easy.

927
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:51,451
- Jae Seok should run. - He should.

928
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:53,121
We might finish this mission.

929
00:35:53,121 --> 00:35:54,391
We have to do more.

930
00:35:54,391 --> 00:35:56,321
Gary can run very fast.

931
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,751
- Gary is redoing his shoelaces. - The three VJ's are...

932
00:35:58,751 --> 00:36:00,621
Kwon Ryeol, Ki Jin and Sung Oh.

933
00:36:00,621 --> 00:36:02,391
- We'll win this one. - We already won.

934
00:36:02,391 --> 00:36:04,651
Are they looking down on us?

935
00:36:04,851 --> 00:36:07,581
Great, this is exactly what Gary needs.

936
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:10,621
Kwon Ryeol gained a lot of weight.

937
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:14,451
(It's an elite VJ team that's been with Running Man for 7 years.)

938
00:36:14,451 --> 00:36:17,721
(Who will win the race?)

939
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:20,281
The 1st runner to start from the 1st floor should go down.

940
00:36:20,281 --> 00:36:22,781
Gary will start from the first floor.

941
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:24,391
- Gary should go. - Do you run both ways?

942
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:26,981
No, you hand the baton to the second runner...

943
00:36:26,981 --> 00:36:28,751
- on the fifth floor. - Okay.

944
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:30,121
One runner has to go down.

945
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,391
- Is that so? - Yes.

946
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:32,891
You two should climb up the stairs.

947
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:34,921
- I'll climb up. - You can come down.

948
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:36,451
- I'll go down. - 2 runners stay on the 1st floor.

949
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:38,751
- Gary should go to the first floor. - Do you have a belt?

950
00:36:38,751 --> 00:36:40,921
The runners go up, down and up.

951
00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:42,981
(Gary leaves to prepare himself for the race.)

952
00:36:44,021 --> 00:36:45,321
I'm not going.

953
00:36:45,551 --> 00:36:47,421
(Here's their chance.)

954
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:54,281
I had my eye on that.

955
00:36:54,651 --> 00:36:57,081
- It's mine. - Come on.

956
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,121
If you take this, what about the person after you?

957
00:36:59,121 --> 00:37:00,151
You can't take it.

958
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,651
Can you start with the shelves?

959
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:03,721
What about the poster frame?

960
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,621
(He doesn't have enough strength.)

961
00:37:06,081 --> 00:37:08,681
- Who took the photo frame? - You can't carry it.

962
00:37:08,751 --> 00:37:10,621
- Haha. - Which photo frame?

963
00:37:11,081 --> 00:37:12,721
Mine was this small.

964
00:37:13,451 --> 00:37:14,781
There's one here.

965
00:37:15,281 --> 00:37:17,081
- Can you get off? - Do it later.

966
00:37:17,181 --> 00:37:18,981
I have to do it now.

967
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,321
You can't carry that.

968
00:37:21,851 --> 00:37:24,051
If she takes the plant, the game is over.

969
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:26,351
(While the two thieves are fighting with a plant...)

970
00:37:26,351 --> 00:37:27,921
That's too big.

971
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:30,121
- Shall we practise? - Let's do it once.

972
00:37:30,821 --> 00:37:33,551
(Here comes Gary.)

973
00:37:34,221 --> 00:37:36,391
If she takes the plant, the game is over.

974
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:37,481
(Gary runs up to the studio.)

975
00:37:37,781 --> 00:37:40,251
(Here I come.)

976
00:37:41,121 --> 00:37:43,281
- It's too big. - Isn't it too big?

977
00:37:43,281 --> 00:37:45,251
It doesn't matter as long as he doesn't see it.

978
00:37:46,781 --> 00:37:48,481
(Ji Hyo steals a big one.)

979
00:37:48,481 --> 00:37:50,681
I'll help you on the stairs.

980
00:37:50,981 --> 00:37:54,121
(Ji Hyo is at risk.)

981
00:37:57,821 --> 00:37:59,451
I'll help you. You might hurt yourself.

982
00:37:59,451 --> 00:38:02,481
(Gary is climbing up from 2nd to 3rd floor.)

983
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:09,221
(Will Gary catch Ji Hyo stealing the plant?)

984
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:11,851
(Or will she make it safely?)

985
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:13,081
Over here.

986
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:16,391
(Or will she make it safely?)

987
00:38:18,251 --> 00:38:20,391
(Ji Hyo is entering the office.)

988
00:38:20,391 --> 00:38:24,051
(Will she get caught or steal the plant successfully?)

989
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:29,181
(Ji Hyo successfully enters.)

990
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,481
(I'm here to register a plant.)

991
00:38:31,481 --> 00:38:33,321
This is good, right?

992
00:38:34,451 --> 00:38:37,651
(Will the plant be bigger than Kwang Soo's item?)

993
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:38,821
It's bigger, right?

994
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,821
You have successfully carried out the hidden mission.

995
00:38:43,481 --> 00:38:45,421
(She doesn't have to steal any more.)

996
00:38:45,421 --> 00:38:46,581
(She doesn't have to steal any more.)

997
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:48,681
Am I the only one left?

998
00:38:48,921 --> 00:38:50,181
Really?

999
00:38:50,321 --> 00:38:51,851
- You can do it. - You can do it.

1000
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:53,891
- Good luck. - You can do it, Gary.

1001
00:38:54,681 --> 00:38:57,081
- You can do it. - Okay.

1002
00:38:57,721 --> 00:38:59,421
Are you ready?

1003
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:02,081
Are you taking that?

1004
00:39:02,121 --> 00:39:04,621
What are you doing over there?

1005
00:39:04,821 --> 00:39:07,051
- Right now is the time. - Please get ready.

1006
00:39:07,051 --> 00:39:09,181
(He tries to steal the sofa.)

1007
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:10,421
Are you moving?

1008
00:39:10,421 --> 00:39:13,651
It's because Ji Hyo took a plant.

1009
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:16,521
- Could you help me? - What are you doing?

1010
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:19,251
What are you doing when there's a race going on?

1011
00:39:20,221 --> 00:39:22,851
I have to do it before Gary comes up.

1012
00:39:23,551 --> 00:39:24,981
Can you carry it downstairs?

1013
00:39:25,151 --> 00:39:27,681
Why did you take a plant?

1014
00:39:27,681 --> 00:39:28,981
Get ready.

1015
00:39:28,981 --> 00:39:31,281
Gary is about to start the race.

1016
00:39:31,391 --> 00:39:33,821
- You can't go downstairs. - The race is about to start.

1017
00:39:33,821 --> 00:39:36,181
(What's happening on the 1st floor?)

1018
00:39:36,281 --> 00:39:38,581
(The first VJ Team member is on standby.)

1019
00:39:38,891 --> 00:39:40,281
He's good at running.

1020
00:39:40,281 --> 00:39:42,321
- Get ready, VJ Team. - I'm ready.

1021
00:39:42,391 --> 00:39:44,781
- Take it easy. Don't try too hard. - Start.

1022
00:39:45,781 --> 00:39:46,921
Start.

1023
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:48,521
(VJ Team's 1st runner starts.)

1024
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:50,921
We might lose the race.

1025
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,551
(We can't say goodbye to Gary so easily.)

1026
00:39:53,551 --> 00:39:57,321
(He runs fast with 7 years of experience on Running Man.)

1027
00:39:58,051 --> 00:40:00,251
You can't go downstairs now because of the race.

1028
00:40:00,751 --> 00:40:01,781
(Next runner is up.)

1029
00:40:01,781 --> 00:40:03,151
He's fast.

1030
00:40:05,351 --> 00:40:06,751
(They're still trying to steal.)

1031
00:40:06,751 --> 00:40:09,181
What's going on? Goodness.

1032
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:11,851
- Another runner will come up. - We're having a race.

1033
00:40:11,851 --> 00:40:13,891
Another runner will come up.

1034
00:40:14,151 --> 00:40:16,981
Another runner will come up.

1035
00:40:17,051 --> 00:40:19,451
Someone will be back soon.

1036
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:21,121
Let's try again.

1037
00:40:21,121 --> 00:40:24,681
(He runs towards the third runner.)

1038
00:40:26,451 --> 00:40:28,221
Just give up, Kwon Ryeol.

1039
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,751
He should have come down much earlier.

1040
00:40:33,421 --> 00:40:34,951
(The third runner is up.)

1041
00:40:36,021 --> 00:40:37,981
(The last spurt is the only way to win.)

1042
00:40:37,981 --> 00:40:40,521
Someone is coming upstairs again.

1043
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:44,481
(He runs with all his might for the finish line.)

1044
00:40:44,481 --> 00:40:45,651
He's coming up.

1045
00:40:46,921 --> 00:40:47,921
He's coming up.

1046
00:40:47,921 --> 00:40:49,221
The record is...

1047
00:40:49,821 --> 00:40:51,681
54.25 seconds.

1048
00:40:51,751 --> 00:40:53,481
- They were fast. - We don't have time.

1049
00:40:54,321 --> 00:40:56,551
- That's impressive. - They were fast.

1050
00:40:56,651 --> 00:40:58,321
(He's in a hurry.)

1051
00:41:00,181 --> 00:41:02,621
It was 54.25 seconds. Are we up next?

1052
00:41:03,321 --> 00:41:06,891
(Nothing can stop him now.)

1053
00:41:07,821 --> 00:41:10,221
- The 1st runner climbs up 1st. - Okay.

1054
00:41:10,221 --> 00:41:12,951
- Wait. - Gary is coming upstairs.

1055
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:17,151
(Will Seok Jin successfully steal the bike?)

1056
00:41:17,151 --> 00:41:18,221
(He can't let Gary find out.)

1057
00:41:18,221 --> 00:41:19,891
- I can't see anything. - This is good.

1058
00:41:19,891 --> 00:41:21,181
Start.

1059
00:41:21,181 --> 00:41:22,681
(He starts.)

1060
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:26,481
(He's confident about running.)

1061
00:41:26,481 --> 00:41:30,281
(He sprints up the stairs at the speed of light.)

1062
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:33,351
(3rd floor)

1063
00:41:33,351 --> 00:41:36,481
(On the 4th floor, Seok Jin struggles.)

1064
00:41:38,251 --> 00:41:40,281
(Run away, Gary is coming.)

1065
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:45,151
(Seok Jin gets startled by the sound.)

1066
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:47,721
Is Gary coming?

1067
00:41:48,181 --> 00:41:49,951
- Is Gary coming? - Yes.

1068
00:41:49,951 --> 00:41:51,081
Here you go.

1069
00:41:51,221 --> 00:41:52,451
Give it to me.

1070
00:41:52,451 --> 00:41:54,021
(Jong Kook forgets to hand the baton.)

1071
00:41:54,951 --> 00:41:58,321
(Seok Jin was scared to death.)

1072
00:41:58,981 --> 00:42:00,281
It's Jong Kook.

1073
00:42:00,281 --> 00:42:01,621
- It is? - Yes.

1074
00:42:01,621 --> 00:42:05,451
- It was only Jong Kook. - Gary is coming up soon.

1075
00:42:05,581 --> 00:42:06,951
Gary is coming.

1076
00:42:07,951 --> 00:42:11,581
(Jae Seok goes down to Gary.)

1077
00:42:12,921 --> 00:42:14,151
Here you go.

1078
00:42:15,021 --> 00:42:16,281
(Gary is up.)

1079
00:42:17,621 --> 00:42:19,821
(Gary starts to run.)

1080
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:21,951
- Gary is coming soon. - This is your last chance.

1081
00:42:23,121 --> 00:42:26,581
(He hopes to succeed in stealing.)

1082
00:42:26,581 --> 00:42:28,151
(He's about to enter.)

1083
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:32,751
(Gary climbs up from 2nd to 3rd.)

1084
00:42:35,151 --> 00:42:37,521
(The entrance is too narrow for the bike.)

1085
00:42:38,281 --> 00:42:40,081
(Make some way for me.)

1086
00:42:41,251 --> 00:42:44,751
(Gary is about to reach the 4th floor.)

1087
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:48,721
(Will Gary catch Seok Jin?)

1088
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:55,051
Gosh, Seok Jin!

1089
00:42:55,891 --> 00:42:57,851
(Gary sees Seok Jin.)

1090
00:42:57,851 --> 00:43:00,681
(Why did I get caught now?)

1091
00:43:02,251 --> 00:43:04,321
(I'm here to register a bike.)

1092
00:43:05,151 --> 00:43:06,351
(Panting)

1093
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,321
If this doesn't work, I'm doomed.

1094
00:43:10,081 --> 00:43:12,281
I don't think it'll work.

1095
00:43:12,651 --> 00:43:14,151
(The bike is a little shorter.)

1096
00:43:14,221 --> 00:43:16,921
I'm in trouble. Isn't it big enough?

1097
00:43:17,621 --> 00:43:19,921
(If Seok Jin weren't in the way...)

1098
00:43:20,451 --> 00:43:21,521
- Gosh. - You're in.

1099
00:43:21,521 --> 00:43:22,821
(What's Running Man Team's record?)

1100
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,051
Did we win?

1101
00:43:24,121 --> 00:43:25,891
- We lost. - What?

1102
00:43:26,281 --> 00:43:27,981
- We lost? - Your record is 58.38 seconds.

1103
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:29,951
- No way. - That's impossible.

1104
00:43:30,221 --> 00:43:31,821
I ran upstairs very fast.

1105
00:43:32,551 --> 00:43:34,251
There's just no way.

1106
00:43:34,981 --> 00:43:36,581
I ran up so fast.

1107
00:43:36,921 --> 00:43:38,481
Why did he take the bike downstairs?

1108
00:43:38,481 --> 00:43:39,821
He was in the way.

1109
00:43:39,821 --> 00:43:41,581
Where is Seok Jin?

1110
00:43:41,781 --> 00:43:44,421
- Are you okay, Ki Jin? - Okay.

1111
00:43:44,621 --> 00:43:46,151
- Okay. - Seok Jin.

1112
00:43:46,451 --> 00:43:48,521
Didn't you take the bike downstairs?

1113
00:43:48,521 --> 00:43:50,451
- What? - You're acting strange.

1114
00:43:51,721 --> 00:43:53,251
What were you doing with the bike downstairs?

1115
00:43:53,251 --> 00:43:56,151
- He blocked your way, didn't he? - Yes, he did.

1116
00:43:56,481 --> 00:43:58,521
- Gosh. - What's wrong with him?

1117
00:43:58,521 --> 00:44:00,481
Why did you bring the bike downstairs?

1118
00:44:00,481 --> 00:44:02,251
- You're strange. - What?

1119
00:44:02,381 --> 00:44:04,121
- What did you do? - He was standing with the bike.

1120
00:44:04,121 --> 00:44:06,051
- Was he? - Were you trying to block him?

1121
00:44:06,051 --> 00:44:08,251
- Is he a spy? - Wait, is he really a spy?

1122
00:44:08,321 --> 00:44:09,781
Seok Jin, are you hiding something?

1123
00:44:09,781 --> 00:44:11,581
Did you encounter him on your way up here?

1124
00:44:11,621 --> 00:44:13,721
He was standing at the corridor with the bike, just like this.

1125
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:15,751
(The timing was really unfortunate.)

1126
00:44:16,651 --> 00:44:17,881
(He was not stealing memories,)

1127
00:44:17,881 --> 00:44:19,021
Gosh, Seok Jin.

1128
00:44:19,021 --> 00:44:21,921
(but he was definitely stealing the bike.)

1129
00:44:23,321 --> 00:44:26,481
I just said "Gosh, Seok Jin." and ran past him.

1130
00:44:26,481 --> 00:44:27,921
(I needed something big for the mission.)

1131
00:44:28,781 --> 00:44:30,021
- My goodness. - Okay, I got it.

1132
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:31,421
You didn't really take it, did you?

1133
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:32,851
No, I told you, I didn't.

1134
00:44:32,851 --> 00:44:33,851
(It was too small, so I put it back.)

1135
00:44:33,851 --> 00:44:34,951
- That was really suspicious. - What's wrong with him?

1136
00:44:34,951 --> 00:44:36,481
Did you steal my gold?

1137
00:44:36,481 --> 00:44:37,481
No way.

1138
00:44:37,821 --> 00:44:41,521
Why would I do that? I'd never steal your gold.

1139
00:44:41,751 --> 00:44:42,821
I have no idea why he did that.

1140
00:44:42,821 --> 00:44:45,121
- It's time for the penalty. - I don't get it, either.

1141
00:44:45,121 --> 00:44:46,181
Get ready, you bicycle thief.

1142
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:49,821
- Come on. Sit. - What? It's Kwang Soo's turn.

1143
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:51,621
- Yes. It's Kwang Soo's turn. - Get down, Seok Jin.

1144
00:44:53,251 --> 00:44:54,621
Why did you take the bicycle?

1145
00:44:54,621 --> 00:44:56,721
- Yes. Why did you do that? - Honestly,

1146
00:44:56,721 --> 00:44:58,021
- I wanted to take it home. - He's strange.

1147
00:44:58,021 --> 00:44:59,921
- Did you try to take it? - Did you load it into your car?

1148
00:44:59,921 --> 00:45:01,421
- No, it's right over there. - Is it? Really?

1149
00:45:01,421 --> 00:45:03,381
- I've put it back there. - It isn't even Gary's bicycle.

1150
00:45:03,381 --> 00:45:04,381
It is his friend's bicycle.

1151
00:45:04,381 --> 00:45:06,321
I just asked people downstairs about its price.

1152
00:45:06,321 --> 00:45:07,781
You can't just take it.

1153
00:45:07,781 --> 00:45:09,621
I can.

1154
00:45:09,621 --> 00:45:11,021
- What? - What do you mean?

1155
00:45:11,221 --> 00:45:13,421
- You can't take it like that. - I want your glasses. Thank you.

1156
00:45:13,621 --> 00:45:15,821
- What's the matter with you? - No. I mean...

1157
00:45:15,821 --> 00:45:17,921
- My goodness. - What are you doing?

1158
00:45:17,921 --> 00:45:19,251
- Are you a spy? - Gosh. Here.

1159
00:45:19,251 --> 00:45:21,821
What are you doing with the glasses?

1160
00:45:21,921 --> 00:45:24,521
I'm really not a spy. Gosh.

1161
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:26,021
Why are you yelling at us?

1162
00:45:26,051 --> 00:45:27,381
I'm talking, not yelling.

1163
00:45:27,481 --> 00:45:30,851
What's wrong with me yelling anyway? Is there a problem?

1164
00:45:30,851 --> 00:45:32,321
No. I mean that you don't have any reason to yell at us.

1165
00:45:32,321 --> 00:45:34,121
He's acting really strange.

1166
00:45:34,751 --> 00:45:36,721
- I shouldn't slap you softly. - Please slap softly.

1167
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:37,721
All right. I get it.

1168
00:45:38,321 --> 00:45:40,081
(Slap)

1169
00:45:41,751 --> 00:45:43,221
He threw himself down on the floor.

1170
00:45:43,221 --> 00:45:44,521
I didn't slap him hard.

1171
00:45:44,521 --> 00:45:45,821
He's acting like a comedian.

1172
00:45:45,821 --> 00:45:47,021
(His reaction is clearly exaggerated.)

1173
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:50,351
Do you want to become a comedian?

1174
00:45:50,951 --> 00:45:52,521
- What changed your mind? - He jumped backwards.

1175
00:45:52,921 --> 00:45:54,521
- Why did you jump like that? - Do you have a secret mission?

1176
00:45:54,521 --> 00:45:57,221
Did you see him jumping backwards just a moment after I slapped him?

1177
00:45:57,581 --> 00:45:58,681
- I did. - He actually jumped like that.

1178
00:45:58,681 --> 00:46:01,381
- He acted like a comedian. - He leaped like a frog.

1179
00:46:01,481 --> 00:46:03,681
(He reacted a moment after...)

1180
00:46:03,681 --> 00:46:06,021
(being slapped.)

1181
00:46:06,751 --> 00:46:08,321
I didn't slap him hard. You saw that, right?

1182
00:46:08,321 --> 00:46:09,581
He's like a comedian today.

1183
00:46:09,621 --> 00:46:10,981
(Seok Jin looks really suspicious.)

1184
00:46:11,581 --> 00:46:13,681
We had to win the race, but you ruined it.

1185
00:46:13,681 --> 00:46:15,421
- What's wrong with you? - Let's give it another try.

1186
00:46:15,421 --> 00:46:17,021
Please choose your next mission.

1187
00:46:17,621 --> 00:46:18,821
Let's pick 30,000km.

1188
00:46:18,821 --> 00:46:20,381
We must pass a mission, at least.

1189
00:46:20,381 --> 00:46:22,551
- Show the mission, please. - What's the mission?

1190
00:46:22,951 --> 00:46:24,081
- "Time Tables"? - It's about time tables.

1191
00:46:24,321 --> 00:46:26,621
The mission that everybody has to pass for 30,000km is...

1192
00:46:26,721 --> 00:46:28,121
"Wrong Time Tables".

1193
00:46:28,381 --> 00:46:29,751
- "Wrong Time Tables"? - "Wrong Time Tables"?

1194
00:46:29,751 --> 00:46:32,021
Each member has to answer time table questions.

1195
00:46:32,021 --> 00:46:34,081
When you answer the questions, you must give the number...

1196
00:46:34,381 --> 00:46:37,321
with correct 2nd digit but with the wrong 1st digit.

1197
00:46:37,321 --> 00:46:39,421
We must answer like, 2 times 9 is 19.

1198
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,981
- Or 9 times 3 is 28. - How about 7 times 3 is 28?

1199
00:46:42,221 --> 00:46:43,681
- This is easier. - It's easier to get it wrong.

1200
00:46:43,681 --> 00:46:45,321
It's easier than the other way around.

1201
00:46:45,321 --> 00:46:46,681
(I'm sure we can pass this game.)

1202
00:46:47,281 --> 00:46:50,981
(I'll get it wrong to bid Gary farewell without any regret.)

1203
00:46:50,981 --> 00:46:52,581
- Are you going in this order? - Yes.

1204
00:46:53,021 --> 00:46:54,151
All right. Let's begin.

1205
00:46:54,721 --> 00:46:56,521
Wrong Time Tables

1206
00:46:56,521 --> 00:46:58,151
- Wrong Time Tables - Wrong Time Tables

1207
00:46:58,151 --> 00:46:59,251
What is 3 times 7?

1208
00:46:59,251 --> 00:47:00,251
22.

1209
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:01,251
What is 6 times 4?

1210
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:02,251
Thirty-throw.

1211
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:03,721
(Is 6 times 4 thirty-throw?)

1212
00:47:03,981 --> 00:47:05,481
(What kind of number is that?)

1213
00:47:05,481 --> 00:47:07,221
What are you doing, Gary?

1214
00:47:07,421 --> 00:47:09,021
- What was that? - Do you have a special mission?

1215
00:47:09,021 --> 00:47:12,521
- You must be on a special mission. - What is "thirty-throw"?

1216
00:47:13,481 --> 00:47:14,981
What is "thirty-throw"?

1217
00:47:14,981 --> 00:47:16,581
- What language is that? - I lost my presence of mind.

1218
00:47:16,581 --> 00:47:18,421
I'm flustered because of the bicycle incident.

1219
00:47:18,421 --> 00:47:20,621
I just lifted it up because it was really pretty. Please forget it.

1220
00:47:20,621 --> 00:47:23,381
- Why did you try to steal the bike? - Why did you do that?

1221
00:47:23,881 --> 00:47:25,951
- You can't steal for that reason. - What is wrong with you?

1222
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:27,881
- I can't stop thinking about it. - I did it because it was pretty.

1223
00:47:27,951 --> 00:47:29,251
Why did he bring it downstairs?

1224
00:47:29,251 --> 00:47:30,421
- Why did you do that, Seok Jin? - What was the reason?

1225
00:47:30,421 --> 00:47:31,781
- How could you do that? - Let's try one more time.

1226
00:47:31,781 --> 00:47:32,881
- Let's do it one more time. - This is your last chance.

1227
00:47:32,881 --> 00:47:35,021
He made a mistake because of the bike incident.

1228
00:47:35,021 --> 00:47:36,621
- We need another chance. - I'll give you a second chance.

1229
00:47:36,621 --> 00:47:38,781
- All right. We can do it. - Yes. Let's go.

1230
00:47:39,051 --> 00:47:40,921
- Don't get it wrong this time. - Yes. Be careful.

1231
00:47:41,021 --> 00:47:42,751
- Wrong Time Tables - Wrong Time Tables

1232
00:47:42,751 --> 00:47:44,221
- Wrong Time Tables - Wrong Time Tables

1233
00:47:44,251 --> 00:47:45,321
What is 9 times 9?

1234
00:47:45,381 --> 00:47:46,381
84.

1235
00:47:46,381 --> 00:47:47,421
What is 6 times 4?

1236
00:47:49,151 --> 00:47:51,281
- 27. - He doesn't know the rule.

1237
00:47:51,521 --> 00:47:53,151
- You got the same question. - I need to get it wrong, right?

1238
00:47:53,321 --> 00:47:54,321
27.

1239
00:47:54,421 --> 00:47:55,421
That was way too slow.

1240
00:47:55,421 --> 00:47:56,781
All right. I'll do it properly next time.

1241
00:47:56,781 --> 00:47:58,651
- What do you mean by next time? - He's so shameless.

1242
00:47:58,681 --> 00:47:59,881
- We don't have another chance. - Come on.

1243
00:47:59,881 --> 00:48:01,781
- I thought that was acceptable. - Gary.

1244
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:04,481
You're just as shameless as Seok Jin.

1245
00:48:05,151 --> 00:48:06,981
Both of you are really shameless.

1246
00:48:06,981 --> 00:48:09,021
Gary seriously needs to keep shooting Running Man.

1247
00:48:09,781 --> 00:48:11,421
- Gary, give it a second thought. - Come on, Gary.

1248
00:48:11,981 --> 00:48:13,081
You match us perfectly.

1249
00:48:13,081 --> 00:48:15,521
You shouldn't live like that.

1250
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:16,921
I didn't have any trouble until now.

1251
00:48:17,781 --> 00:48:18,881
Gary, you belong here.

1252
00:48:18,881 --> 00:48:20,621
You can just use a calculator for multiplications.

1253
00:48:20,781 --> 00:48:22,051
- This is your final chance. - All right.

1254
00:48:22,051 --> 00:48:24,421
- Let's begin with Haha, again. - Okay. Stay focused, everyone.

1255
00:48:24,421 --> 00:48:26,021
- Wrong time tables - I feel...

1256
00:48:26,051 --> 00:48:27,421
- Okay. Let's begin. - I feel more pressured now.

1257
00:48:27,421 --> 00:48:31,151
(Seriously, let's deduct some distance.)

1258
00:48:31,151 --> 00:48:32,151
Let's start.

1259
00:48:32,581 --> 00:48:34,121
- Wrong time tables - Wrong time tables

1260
00:48:34,121 --> 00:48:35,621
- Wrong time tables - Wrong time tables

1261
00:48:35,681 --> 00:48:36,681
What is 7 times 5?

1262
00:48:36,681 --> 00:48:37,681
32.

1263
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,151
- What is 2 times 4? - Jix.

1264
00:48:40,381 --> 00:48:41,381
(Jix?)

1265
00:48:41,681 --> 00:48:42,881
(He's stupid enough to be part of Running Man.)

1266
00:48:42,881 --> 00:48:44,421
- You tried to say "6". - Was it 6?

1267
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,251
- He said "Jix", instead. - He wanted to say "six".

1268
00:48:47,251 --> 00:48:48,921
- What was that? - You wanted to say "six".

1269
00:48:48,921 --> 00:48:49,981
I said a wrong number.

1270
00:48:49,981 --> 00:48:51,821
- Anyway... - What's the matter?

1271
00:48:51,821 --> 00:48:52,821
What did I do wrong?

1272
00:48:52,821 --> 00:48:54,481
- That was cute. - It was a cute six.

1273
00:48:54,481 --> 00:48:55,621
(He should've said a proper number.)

1274
00:48:55,621 --> 00:48:57,651
- That was really strange. - What on earth is "jix"?

1275
00:48:58,481 --> 00:49:00,781
- I said six. - You are strange.

1276
00:49:00,781 --> 00:49:03,721
- It was six. - Gary, just stay with us.

1277
00:49:03,851 --> 00:49:05,121
- "Jix". - My goodness.

1278
00:49:06,181 --> 00:49:07,921
I just spoke six a little differently.

1279
00:49:07,921 --> 00:49:09,421
What's wrong with his pronunciation?

1280
00:49:09,481 --> 00:49:11,621
- I said 6. - 2 times 4 is "jix".

1281
00:49:11,721 --> 00:49:13,381
We wouldn't be able to see him acting like this any more.

1282
00:49:13,381 --> 00:49:15,421
They might sound different, but they have the same meaning.

1283
00:49:15,421 --> 00:49:16,421
(It's the last time seeing Gary with them.)

1284
00:49:16,881 --> 00:49:18,381
- How could we fail? - We missed a great opportunity.

1285
00:49:18,381 --> 00:49:21,051
Should we try the ones which deduct 10,000km?

1286
00:49:21,051 --> 00:49:22,251
We shouldn't have failed "Wrong Time Tables".

1287
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:24,421
What kind of present will Gary receive?

1288
00:49:24,421 --> 00:49:26,321
- Nothing. - We've got nothing so far.

1289
00:49:26,321 --> 00:49:28,021
Gary can win this Running Man Set.

1290
00:49:28,021 --> 00:49:29,321
What is that?

1291
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:31,321
No.

1292
00:49:31,681 --> 00:49:33,321
Isn't it the set that we can buy at stationery stores?

1293
00:49:33,621 --> 00:49:36,121
It's the set containing the R flag, cue cards and R stickers.

1294
00:49:36,121 --> 00:49:39,621
Gary, if you get this set, set up the flag here...

1295
00:49:39,621 --> 00:49:40,721
so we can play Running Man games here.

1296
00:49:40,721 --> 00:49:42,151
Okay. We can use it that way.

1297
00:49:42,151 --> 00:49:43,521
- Good. - It's quite meaningful, then.

1298
00:49:43,521 --> 00:49:44,781
- It is meaningful. - Yes.

1299
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:47,121
All right. Please choose the next game.

1300
00:49:47,121 --> 00:49:48,321
Let's pick 30,000km.

1301
00:49:49,881 --> 00:49:51,021
- "Yut"? - Good.

1302
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:52,651
This is good.

1303
00:49:53,021 --> 00:49:54,951
(Everyone's happy with Yut.)

1304
00:49:55,651 --> 00:49:56,951
I'm sure I can ace this.

1305
00:49:57,221 --> 00:49:58,581
Everyone has to throw one yut each.

1306
00:49:58,581 --> 00:50:01,121
You will succeed If all yut shows the same side,

1307
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:02,821
(All yut has to face the same side.)

1308
00:50:03,581 --> 00:50:04,751
I'm sure I can ace this.

1309
00:50:05,451 --> 00:50:10,021
(After 7 years together, this kind of mission is a piece of cake.)

1310
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:14,621
(It's a great chance to deduct 30,000km.)

1311
00:50:14,621 --> 00:50:15,751
I'm really good at playing yut.

1312
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:18,321
- Okay. - Let's go. Haha's first.

1313
00:50:18,321 --> 00:50:19,781
- Just flip it once in the air. - Yes. Just like that.

1314
00:50:19,781 --> 00:50:21,581
All right. Let's begin with Haha.

1315
00:50:21,581 --> 00:50:23,951
Everyone's yut has to show the same side facing up. Let's begin.

1316
00:50:25,351 --> 00:50:27,481
(Haha's yut shows the front side up.)

1317
00:50:27,581 --> 00:50:28,721
It might be harder than I thought.

1318
00:50:29,221 --> 00:50:30,721
(The front side up? I get it.)

1319
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:36,121
(I just need to toss this yut lightly in the air.)

1320
00:50:37,151 --> 00:50:39,681
(Gary's yut shows the front side up.)

1321
00:50:40,721 --> 00:50:42,551
Good. Gary tossed it perfectly.

1322
00:50:42,981 --> 00:50:47,021
(I don't want to let you go, but I'll do my best for you.)

1323
00:50:49,321 --> 00:50:50,881
- That looks good. - Okay.

1324
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:51,881
(Ji Hyo's yut shows the front side up.)

1325
00:50:52,581 --> 00:50:55,221
(We only have four more to go!)

1326
00:50:56,421 --> 00:50:59,021
(Did he fail?)

1327
00:50:59,021 --> 00:51:05,081
(Now, all Jong Kook needs is a bit of luck.)

1328
00:51:06,681 --> 00:51:07,721
(Jong Kook's yut shows the front side up.)

1329
00:51:07,721 --> 00:51:09,521
- That was really close. - Now, it's our turn.

1330
00:51:09,521 --> 00:51:11,051
- We only have three more to go. - All the unlucky ones are left.

1331
00:51:11,051 --> 00:51:13,021
(The Unlucky Trio will test their luck with their yut.)

1332
00:51:13,021 --> 00:51:14,081
Here comes the unlucky trio.

1333
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:19,021
(Would unlucky Seok Jin be able to succeed this time?)

1334
00:51:20,551 --> 00:51:23,481
(Unbelievably, Seok Jin's yut shows the front side up.)

1335
00:51:25,521 --> 00:51:26,851
(The second member of the trio looks really anxious.)

1336
00:51:26,851 --> 00:51:28,021
- Here comes the super unlucky one. - You can do it, Kwang Soo.

1337
00:51:28,021 --> 00:51:29,581
- It's easy. - I thought I'd never have a chance.

1338
00:51:29,581 --> 00:51:30,881
- Come on, unlucky Kwang Soo. - Gosh.

1339
00:51:30,881 --> 00:51:33,451
- Come on. - We have the unluckiest two left.

1340
00:51:33,721 --> 00:51:35,751
- He's really nervous. - I thought I'd never have a chance.

1341
00:51:35,751 --> 00:51:37,481
Throw your yut at the same time.

1342
00:51:38,451 --> 00:51:40,021
Just toss it.

1343
00:51:40,021 --> 00:51:41,981
(It's my chance to show how lucky I am to everyone.)

1344
00:51:41,981 --> 00:51:43,221
- Okay. - Don't get too nervous.

1345
00:51:43,221 --> 00:51:44,621
Just toss it lightly in the air.

1346
00:51:44,951 --> 00:51:47,621
- Just toss it. - It's your turn now.

1347
00:51:47,621 --> 00:51:52,781
(I can do this. I can do this for Gary.)

1348
00:51:55,451 --> 00:51:58,581
(Gosh! Did he fail again?)

1349
00:52:01,221 --> 00:52:05,681
(Kwang Soo succeeds to get his yut show the front side up.)

1350
00:52:06,651 --> 00:52:07,751
(It's miraculous.)

1351
00:52:07,751 --> 00:52:09,781
- This is crazy. - Are you in your right mind?

1352
00:52:10,051 --> 00:52:11,981
- Gosh. - Jae Seok. It's your turn.

1353
00:52:11,981 --> 00:52:13,781
- Although you're unlucky... - You're the last.

1354
00:52:13,921 --> 00:52:15,221
Here comes the unluckiest.

1355
00:52:15,321 --> 00:52:16,581
He's definitely the unluckiest.

1356
00:52:16,581 --> 00:52:17,751
Can he do it?

1357
00:52:17,981 --> 00:52:19,881
- Just toss it. - Okay.

1358
00:52:19,881 --> 00:52:21,281
- It's okay, Jae Seok. - It's our chance to deduct...

1359
00:52:21,321 --> 00:52:22,951
- 30,000km. We count on you. - Just toss it lightly in the air.

1360
00:52:22,951 --> 00:52:25,621
- Just toss it. - Toss it lightly.

1361
00:52:25,621 --> 00:52:27,881
(Jae Seok's yut will decide whether Gary will get the R flag or not.)

1362
00:52:28,221 --> 00:52:30,581
(Jae Seok tries to concentrate.)

1363
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:32,921
- Gary should receive something. - Toss it lightly. Just toss it.

1364
00:52:32,921 --> 00:52:34,421
If you fail, then Gary will receive nothing.

1365
00:52:34,421 --> 00:52:36,021
(Will they be able to give a present to Gary before he leaves?)

1366
00:52:36,321 --> 00:52:37,881
Toss it lightly and you will succeed.

1367
00:52:37,881 --> 00:52:44,021
(Will Jae Seok be able to get his yut showing front side up?)

1368
00:52:46,481 --> 00:52:49,721
(They succeeds "Yut" with all their yut showing front side up.)

1369
00:52:54,021 --> 00:52:55,021
- Good job. - Nice.

1370
00:52:55,021 --> 00:52:57,021
- My goodness. - We succeeded.

1371
00:52:57,021 --> 00:52:59,121
- Finally, we got this. - Good job, everyone.

1372
00:52:59,121 --> 00:53:00,981
- Finally, we did it. - We are a united team, indeed.

1373
00:53:00,981 --> 00:53:02,421
(7012 means that 7 of them are united as one.)

1374
00:53:02,421 --> 00:53:03,921
We are good at getting the same results.

1375
00:53:03,921 --> 00:53:06,151
- Thank you, everyone. - We are always good at this.

1376
00:53:06,221 --> 00:53:07,951
- That was close. - 30,000km is deducted.

1377
00:53:08,621 --> 00:53:10,221
- We finally deducted some distance. - How much is left?

1378
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:11,581
- It's unbelievable. - The Unlucky Trio made it.

1379
00:53:12,051 --> 00:53:13,621
We can finish it if we choose and succeed the 50,000 one.

1380
00:53:13,621 --> 00:53:14,781
- Okay. - Wait.

1381
00:53:15,051 --> 00:53:16,321
- We need to clear one more mission. - I can't believe we did it.

1382
00:53:16,321 --> 00:53:19,851
Let's choose 30,000km first, then play another 10,000km.

1383
00:53:19,851 --> 00:53:20,851
Please show us what the game is.

1384
00:53:21,321 --> 00:53:22,321
Let's go.

1385
00:53:23,521 --> 00:53:24,681
- "Name Tag"? - What's that?

1386
00:53:24,751 --> 00:53:26,451
You need to find mini name tags.

1387
00:53:26,481 --> 00:53:27,481
Do we need to find them?

1388
00:53:27,581 --> 00:53:29,121
How small are they?

1389
00:53:29,121 --> 00:53:30,781
- Do you know the movie, "Ant-Man"? - Yes.

1390
00:53:31,181 --> 00:53:32,381
The name tags are as small as the Ant-Man from the movie.

1391
00:53:32,481 --> 00:53:33,681
Really?

1392
00:53:33,781 --> 00:53:35,321
How did you make such small name tags?

1393
00:53:35,321 --> 00:53:38,151
You have five minutes to find the name tags hidden in this studio.

1394
00:53:38,151 --> 00:53:39,881
- How about the living room? - You need to search there, too.

1395
00:53:39,881 --> 00:53:41,151
Can we help each other?

1396
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:42,951
Do whatever you can. Just find them all in five minutes.

1397
00:53:42,951 --> 00:53:44,481
Five minutes? It's long enough to find them all.

1398
00:53:44,481 --> 00:53:46,821
Ready, set, start.

1399
00:53:46,821 --> 00:53:48,781
- You have five minutes from now. - Come on. We can do it.

1400
00:53:49,121 --> 00:53:50,281
It must be in this room.

1401
00:53:51,251 --> 00:53:55,421
(Let's do this for Gary.)

1402
00:53:55,421 --> 00:53:56,881
How am I supposed to find them?

1403
00:53:58,051 --> 00:53:59,181
How small are they?

1404
00:54:00,051 --> 00:54:01,421
I know there's one in this room.

1405
00:54:01,421 --> 00:54:03,581
(They can't find anything even with the help of the magnifying lens.)

1406
00:54:03,581 --> 00:54:06,281
Does this mean we can't see it with our naked eyes?

1407
00:54:06,381 --> 00:54:08,181
I think we'll be able to spot them.

1408
00:54:09,181 --> 00:54:10,921
It's highly likely they hid one in here.

1409
00:54:10,921 --> 00:54:13,151
(Gary is busy searching his room.)

1410
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:19,321
Hold on.

1411
00:54:19,321 --> 00:54:22,381
(Seok Jin is looking for something bigger.)

1412
00:54:24,621 --> 00:54:27,781
(Is he going to steal the carpet?)

1413
00:54:27,781 --> 00:54:29,751
Ji Hyo is driving me crazy.

1414
00:54:30,221 --> 00:54:32,121
(Seok Jin only goes for big objects.)

1415
00:54:32,121 --> 00:54:33,621
Why did Ji Hyo have to steal that?

1416
00:54:33,621 --> 00:54:34,781
Is there one in the bathroom?

1417
00:54:35,281 --> 00:54:36,351
(Seok Jin steps on the carpet.)

1418
00:54:37,221 --> 00:54:40,051
(Are you moving?)

1419
00:54:41,751 --> 00:54:43,021
- Did you find it? - No.

1420
00:54:43,021 --> 00:54:44,851
(Seok Jin has obtained the carpet.)

1421
00:54:45,051 --> 00:54:46,321
This is so hard.

1422
00:54:49,421 --> 00:54:51,421
- Did you find it? - It's Jong Kook.

1423
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:52,651
- Where is it? - Look.

1424
00:54:54,281 --> 00:54:55,781
- Jong Kook. - What?

1425
00:54:55,781 --> 00:54:57,521
- I found yours. - You found it?

1426
00:54:58,481 --> 00:55:02,581
(Seok Jin is about to get caught.)

1427
00:55:02,581 --> 00:55:03,751
(I'll take the carpet over the bicycle.)

1428
00:55:03,751 --> 00:55:06,121
- How small is it? - You can spot them with your eyes.

1429
00:55:06,121 --> 00:55:07,351
How did you find that?

1430
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:09,121
- Jong Kook. - What?

1431
00:55:09,121 --> 00:55:11,481
- I found yours. - How small is it?

1432
00:55:11,921 --> 00:55:15,081
(Gary comes into the living room.)

1433
00:55:15,481 --> 00:55:21,851
(Seok Jin can't afford to get caught stealing again.)

1434
00:55:22,121 --> 00:55:23,281
It's Jong Kook's.

1435
00:55:23,751 --> 00:55:26,621
(Seok Jin is about to step outside.)

1436
00:55:26,621 --> 00:55:29,381
(Gary appears right on time.)

1437
00:55:29,381 --> 00:55:32,581
(He's closing in on Seok Jin.)

1438
00:55:32,581 --> 00:55:37,321
(What will happen to Seok Jin?)

1439
00:55:37,651 --> 00:55:38,721
Really?

1440
00:55:41,121 --> 00:55:42,651
This was the only one.

1441
00:55:42,651 --> 00:55:43,821
(He managed to escape.)

1442
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:47,681
This was the only one.

1443
00:55:47,881 --> 00:55:49,921
Can you hold the door for me?

1444
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:51,451
This is so heavy.

1445
00:55:53,581 --> 00:55:54,751
This will work.

1446
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:56,181
I'm sure of it.

1447
00:55:56,581 --> 00:55:57,781
This can't not work.

1448
00:55:57,781 --> 00:55:59,951
(The bicycle thief grew as a big time thief.)

1449
00:55:59,951 --> 00:56:01,251
How did they all do this?

1450
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:04,921
- The diameter is 236cm. - That's it?

1451
00:56:05,151 --> 00:56:06,221
It's good, right?

1452
00:56:06,751 --> 00:56:07,821
You've succeeded.

1453
00:56:07,821 --> 00:56:09,951
(Seok Jin succeeded the secret mission.)

1454
00:56:09,951 --> 00:56:11,351
I didn't think the bicycle would be too small.

1455
00:56:11,481 --> 00:56:14,251
I have to pay him back now for the bicycle.

1456
00:56:14,781 --> 00:56:15,981
(All the members have succeeded.)

1457
00:56:16,481 --> 00:56:19,021
(They succeeded the mission with 8 seconds remaining.)

1458
00:56:19,081 --> 00:56:20,581
You've succeeded.

1459
00:56:20,751 --> 00:56:22,181
Where'd the carpet go?

1460
00:56:23,851 --> 00:56:25,981
- Where did it go? - There used to be a carpet here.

1461
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:27,281
Where did it go?

1462
00:56:27,451 --> 00:56:30,221
The staff moved it because it was getting dusty.

1463
00:56:30,681 --> 00:56:31,951
The room looks so vacant now.

1464
00:56:32,721 --> 00:56:34,621
Didn't the room look better with the carpet?

1465
00:56:34,621 --> 00:56:36,781
The staff moved it somewhere.

1466
00:56:36,881 --> 00:56:38,681
It's not in the back of your car, is it?

1467
00:56:38,851 --> 00:56:41,951
What are you talking about? That's nonsense.

1468
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,481
It got even dustier in here.

1469
00:56:44,481 --> 00:56:46,481
They said it's not good for the respiratory system.

1470
00:56:46,681 --> 00:56:49,881
(First the bicycle and now the carpet? This is strange.)

1471
00:56:50,051 --> 00:56:52,821
You have accumulated 60,000km.

1472
00:56:52,821 --> 00:56:54,151
(They accumulated that much after 7 failed attempts.)

1473
00:56:54,151 --> 00:56:56,021
- Let's do 30,000 now. - Let's do it.

1474
00:56:56,021 --> 00:56:58,281
Should we do 30,000 for "Staff Members"?

1475
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,621
- That's the only one left. - Let's do it, then.

1476
00:57:00,621 --> 00:57:01,881
30,000 for "Staff Members".

1477
00:57:02,821 --> 00:57:06,251
(I have a bad feeling about this.)

1478
00:57:06,821 --> 00:57:07,921
Please turn it over.

1479
00:57:07,921 --> 00:57:11,021
(What's the mission for 30,000km?)

1480
00:57:11,221 --> 00:57:12,651
("Camera Staff")

1481
00:57:12,651 --> 00:57:14,421
- "Camera Staff". - What's that?

1482
00:57:15,321 --> 00:57:17,281
For this mission,

1483
00:57:17,651 --> 00:57:20,681
you will have to arm wrestle the camera staff.

1484
00:57:21,781 --> 00:57:23,251
(This is bad news.)

1485
00:57:23,251 --> 00:57:24,281
Just one of us?

1486
00:57:24,551 --> 00:57:28,581
Three people from each side will have a battle of arm wrestle.

1487
00:57:28,581 --> 00:57:31,621
- The first team to win twice wins. - Two wins?

1488
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:34,051
- I'm not good at arm wrestling. - Me neither.

1489
00:57:34,051 --> 00:57:36,551
(Jong Kook is getting warmed up.)

1490
00:57:36,551 --> 00:57:40,581
We will bring out three members from the camera staff.

1491
00:57:40,581 --> 00:57:43,421
- This is going to be hard. - They're so strong.

1492
00:57:43,421 --> 00:57:44,821
- They'll break our arms. - They're really strong.

1493
00:57:45,581 --> 00:57:47,721
(Here they come.)

1494
00:57:48,051 --> 00:57:50,151
We should be fine as long as the zimizib staff doesn't come.

1495
00:57:51,081 --> 00:57:53,821
(Everything will be okay as long as it's not the zimizib staff.)

1496
00:57:54,421 --> 00:57:56,221
I think it's him.

1497
00:57:56,221 --> 00:57:57,981
(Gary has a bad feeling.)

1498
00:57:57,981 --> 00:57:59,551
I think it's him.

1499
00:57:59,681 --> 00:58:01,651
(You can tell he's strong in a glance.)

1500
00:58:01,651 --> 00:58:04,451
(This man has a history.)

1501
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:09,681
(He almost covered the Running Man Field Day with blood.)

1502
00:58:09,681 --> 00:58:11,951
(You'll be hospitalised with a slight nudge by him.)

1503
00:58:11,951 --> 00:58:15,881
(It's Mr Zimizib, Yoon Hong Min.)

1504
00:58:15,881 --> 00:58:18,051
- Are you kidding me? - He shouldn't be here.

1505
00:58:18,051 --> 00:58:19,481
(Jong Kook looks slightly nervous.)

1506
00:58:19,481 --> 00:58:21,051
This is too much.

1507
00:58:21,051 --> 00:58:22,081
(This can't be done.)

1508
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:25,381
I'll introduce the lineup of the team.

1509
00:58:25,381 --> 00:58:26,881
There's Yoon Hong Min.

1510
00:58:26,881 --> 00:58:28,581
He's so strong.

1511
00:58:28,581 --> 00:58:32,251
- The youngest one is Suh Dong Hwi. - He looks strong.

1512
00:58:32,521 --> 00:58:35,251
Their last member and leader is Kang Chan Hee.

1513
00:58:35,251 --> 00:58:37,681
(Kang Chan Hee, Team Leader)

1514
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:39,921
I'll go against him.

1515
00:58:40,121 --> 00:58:41,921
We'll take a win from him.

1516
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:43,321
Chan Hee isn't all that.

1517
00:58:43,321 --> 00:58:45,181
(Mr Kang prefers technique over strength.)

1518
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:46,951
Please decide on who'll go first.

1519
00:58:46,951 --> 00:58:48,521
(The order will greatly affect the result.)

1520
00:58:48,821 --> 00:58:51,521
(On the other hand, the camera staff look at ease.)

1521
00:58:51,981 --> 00:58:53,751
(Both teams decided on the order of the lineup.)

1522
00:58:53,751 --> 00:58:56,551
These are the two people for the first match.

1523
00:58:56,551 --> 00:58:58,851
The first player from Running Man is...

1524
00:58:58,851 --> 00:59:02,421
(The first player from Running Man is?)

1525
00:59:02,421 --> 00:59:03,521
- Gary. - Yes!

1526
00:59:03,781 --> 00:59:05,451
The first player from the camera staff is...

1527
00:59:06,481 --> 00:59:08,381
- Kang Chan Hee. - I knew it.

1528
00:59:08,381 --> 00:59:10,221
(Kang Chan Hee goes first.)

1529
00:59:10,221 --> 00:59:13,121
- We have to win this one. - You have to win.

1530
00:59:13,121 --> 00:59:14,681
- I can't afford to win. - You have to win.

1531
00:59:14,821 --> 00:59:18,081
- Don't let your guard down. - He could be strong.

1532
00:59:18,081 --> 00:59:20,521
- Don't underestimate him. - I haven't worked out for so long.

1533
00:59:20,521 --> 00:59:22,381
Look at his arms.

1534
00:59:22,381 --> 00:59:25,851
(He has strong muscles from holding heavy cameras.)

1535
00:59:25,851 --> 00:59:27,751
Look at how broad his shoulders are.

1536
00:59:28,451 --> 00:59:29,481
Chan Hee is pretty strong, too.

1537
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:30,581
His grip is so strong.

1538
00:59:31,051 --> 00:59:34,451
He's been working with heavy cameras all this time.

1539
00:59:35,981 --> 00:59:38,381
He's so strong. I don't think I'll win.

1540
00:59:38,581 --> 00:59:39,651
Get ready.

1541
00:59:39,651 --> 00:59:43,821
(It's the battle between the leaders of each team.)

1542
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:46,951
(This won't be easy for both sides.)

1543
00:59:46,951 --> 00:59:48,521
Set. Go.

1544
00:59:49,951 --> 00:59:51,051
He won.

1545
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:53,121
(He's surprised.)

1546
00:59:54,051 --> 00:59:56,321
(That was the end of him.)

1547
00:59:56,321 --> 00:59:57,821
- Did you let me win? - No.

1548
00:59:57,821 --> 00:59:59,251
(He does prefer technique over strength.)

1549
00:59:59,251 --> 01:00:00,921
- What was that? - That was easy.

1550
01:00:01,421 --> 01:00:03,151
Team Running Man is leading by one point.

1551
01:00:03,151 --> 01:00:04,581
We just need one more victory now.

1552
01:00:04,581 --> 01:00:06,181
Who's up next?

1553
01:00:06,181 --> 01:00:08,851
The second player from Running Man is Kwang Soo.

1554
01:00:08,851 --> 01:00:10,651
- Okay. - You can win it for us.

1555
01:00:10,651 --> 01:00:13,381
The second player from the camera staff is Yoon Hong Min.

1556
01:00:13,381 --> 01:00:15,051
(It's Yoon Hong Min.)

1557
01:00:15,051 --> 01:00:16,281
(I'm going against the zimizib?)

1558
01:00:16,281 --> 01:00:18,181
What a twist of fate.

1559
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:19,581
Kwang Soo isn't that weak.

1560
01:00:19,581 --> 01:00:21,581
(Mr Zimizib enters the stage.)

1561
01:00:21,581 --> 01:00:25,481
(The 2nd round is Kwang Soo against Hong Min.)

1562
01:00:27,351 --> 01:00:29,581
(He's very serious.)

1563
01:00:29,581 --> 01:00:32,521
(He's determined.)

1564
01:00:33,721 --> 01:00:34,781
It feels totally different this time.

1565
01:00:34,951 --> 01:00:36,621
This is an important match.

1566
01:00:36,621 --> 01:00:37,851
Ready.

1567
01:00:38,251 --> 01:00:40,281
(The fate of "Balance the Distance" lies in Kwang Soo's hands.)

1568
01:00:40,281 --> 01:00:41,751
Set, go!

1569
01:00:41,751 --> 01:00:44,081
(The 2nd round begins.)

1570
01:00:45,781 --> 01:00:47,381
(It's a close one.)

1571
01:00:47,381 --> 01:00:48,781
Kwang Soo is fighting back.

1572
01:00:48,781 --> 01:00:50,351
He's winning.

1573
01:00:50,351 --> 01:00:52,781
(Kwang Soo unleashes his power against Mr Zimizib.)

1574
01:00:53,481 --> 01:00:55,451
He's winning.

1575
01:00:56,151 --> 01:01:00,081
(We only thought of Kwang Soo as...)

1576
01:01:00,381 --> 01:01:05,851
(a tall and weak giraffe.)

1577
01:01:07,051 --> 01:01:11,381
(He's always been a troublemaker.)

1578
01:01:11,381 --> 01:01:14,951
I can't do this. This is the end of me.

1579
01:01:15,781 --> 01:01:20,251
(He's determined...)

1580
01:01:21,081 --> 01:01:25,351
(to give something to Gary.)

1581
01:01:26,481 --> 01:01:29,021
(He's trying his hardest.)

1582
01:01:30,221 --> 01:01:32,821
(Is he going to make the miracle happen?)

1583
01:01:32,821 --> 01:01:34,421
Kwang Soo is determined.

1584
01:01:34,481 --> 01:01:36,121
Is this really happening?

1585
01:01:38,451 --> 01:01:41,921
(Kwang Soo wins!)

1586
01:01:41,921 --> 01:01:45,381
(He did it!)

1587
01:01:45,651 --> 01:01:51,221
(Kwang Soo desperately wanted to win this one for Gary.)

1588
01:01:51,881 --> 01:01:52,951
(He's in pain.)

1589
01:01:52,951 --> 01:01:54,521
- He's a beast. - He's stronger than he looks.

1590
01:01:54,721 --> 01:01:55,781
That was amazing.

1591
01:01:56,221 --> 01:01:58,921
(Kwang Soo's surprising performance puts an end to Gary's last mission.)

1592
01:01:58,921 --> 01:02:00,651
The score is 2 to 0.

1593
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:03,181
The game is over. You have succeeded.

1594
01:02:03,181 --> 01:02:04,181
(They successfully accumulate a total of 77,000km.)

1595
01:02:04,181 --> 01:02:06,421
Do I win the flag?

1596
01:02:06,451 --> 01:02:08,121
You will be awarded with the Running Man package.

1597
01:02:08,121 --> 01:02:09,521
(Gary wins the Running Man package as a reward.)

1598
01:02:09,521 --> 01:02:13,851
We should've done better for him.

1599
01:02:14,121 --> 01:02:15,651
At least, he won something.

1600
01:02:15,651 --> 01:02:18,681
I'll put out the flag even when it rains or snows.

1601
01:02:18,721 --> 01:02:20,321
What's all this junk?

1602
01:02:21,381 --> 01:02:23,821
You have no idea how much the kids love these things.

1603
01:02:23,821 --> 01:02:25,281
(They will be sold at high prices among elementary school kids.)

1604
01:02:25,281 --> 01:02:27,321
I like the flags.

1605
01:02:27,321 --> 01:02:30,081
There's another gift from the staff members.

1606
01:02:30,281 --> 01:02:32,781
- Really? - Is Gary really leaving?

1607
01:02:33,081 --> 01:02:34,421
(These are the gifts.)

1608
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:36,651
- What's this? - Is it a puzzle?

1609
01:02:36,781 --> 01:02:39,251
They made your face with all the pictures of the past.

1610
01:02:40,151 --> 01:02:45,281
They're pictures of the members from episode 1 to 317.

1611
01:02:45,281 --> 01:02:47,581
- This is amazing. - You made my face with those?

1612
01:02:47,581 --> 01:02:51,051
Yes. Look at this picture whenever you miss us.

1613
01:02:52,021 --> 01:02:53,251
It's made of gold.

1614
01:02:53,851 --> 01:02:54,951
What?

1615
01:02:55,381 --> 01:02:56,521
Are you serious?

1616
01:02:56,581 --> 01:02:58,781
- What is that? - It's made of gold.

1617
01:02:59,321 --> 01:03:01,121
Thank you...

1618
01:03:01,121 --> 01:03:03,421
- for all the memories. - It's severance pay.

1619
01:03:03,881 --> 01:03:05,321
That's your severance pay.

1620
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:08,721
Gary has been with us every Sunday.

1621
01:03:09,151 --> 01:03:10,821
It's time to say goodbye now.

1622
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:13,351
This is his last day with us.

1623
01:03:13,351 --> 01:03:15,351
Let's give a big round of applause...

1624
01:03:15,351 --> 01:03:18,181
for all his hard work.

1625
01:03:18,421 --> 01:03:19,951
- Thank you. - Good job, Gary.

1626
01:03:19,951 --> 01:03:21,181
(Well done.)

1627
01:03:21,821 --> 01:03:22,851
Looks like...

1628
01:03:22,851 --> 01:03:25,981
Ji Hyo will have to find a new boyfriend.

1629
01:03:25,981 --> 01:03:28,651
I thought she'd cry. I'm a bit disappointed.

1630
01:03:28,651 --> 01:03:31,751
Ji Hyo should say something.

1631
01:03:31,751 --> 01:03:38,051
(Ji Hyo spent the most time with him as Monday Couple.)

1632
01:03:43,621 --> 01:03:46,181
I already talked to him in private.

1633
01:03:46,351 --> 01:03:47,551
I see.

1634
01:03:47,981 --> 01:03:50,051
I'm sad.

1635
01:03:50,581 --> 01:03:52,351
I'm sad to see you leave,

1636
01:03:52,981 --> 01:03:55,421
but I support you in all of your endeavours. Good luck.

1637
01:03:55,751 --> 01:03:59,151
I'll repeat what Ji Hyo said about Gary...

1638
01:03:59,181 --> 01:04:03,151
when Gary wasn't present at the time.

1639
01:04:03,681 --> 01:04:07,721
"Mondays without him will feel so empty from now on."

1640
01:04:08,081 --> 01:04:10,821
- She said that while crying. - When did I say that?

1641
01:04:10,821 --> 01:04:13,481
- I didn't say that. - I heard her say something else.

1642
01:04:14,021 --> 01:04:15,681
"Is Gary out of his mind?"

1643
01:04:17,881 --> 01:04:19,681
That's what I heard.

1644
01:04:20,881 --> 01:04:24,751
Gary talked about his dreams as a musician.

1645
01:04:24,751 --> 01:04:27,351
We hope your dreams will come true.

1646
01:04:27,351 --> 01:04:29,081
Thank you, Gary.

1647
01:04:29,321 --> 01:04:30,451
Thank you.

1648
01:04:30,451 --> 01:04:32,821
We'll have dinner with everyone.

1649
01:04:32,821 --> 01:04:33,921
Is that so? Shall we go?

1650
01:04:33,921 --> 01:04:36,181
Gary, please close the clapperboard to end the show.

1651
01:04:36,321 --> 01:04:37,821
It's your last time.

1652
01:04:38,351 --> 01:04:39,951
In 1, 2, 3.

1653
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,621
- Thank you, everyone. - Let's take a photo.

1654
01:04:43,081 --> 01:04:44,651
(It's time for a farewell party.)

1655
01:04:44,651 --> 01:04:46,621
Do we go inside?

1656
01:04:46,721 --> 01:04:48,551
Did you prepare this for me?

1657
01:04:49,881 --> 01:04:52,181
(We want Gary, our boyfriend on Mondays, to stay.)

1658
01:04:52,181 --> 01:04:55,551
Thank you so much for the last seven years, and enjoy the food.

1659
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:57,651
Thank you for everything. Thank you.

1660
01:04:58,281 --> 01:04:59,381
Thank you.

1661
01:04:59,381 --> 01:05:02,081
(We thank Gary for 77,000km of his passion.)

1662
01:05:02,081 --> 01:05:03,321
Enjoy your food.

1663
01:05:03,321 --> 01:05:05,351
(We thank Gary for 77,000km of his passion.)

1664
01:05:05,621 --> 01:05:10,851
(Running Man will stay with you wherever you go.)

1665
01:05:11,221 --> 01:05:12,751
- See you. - Thank you.

1666
01:05:13,151 --> 01:05:14,551
Goodbye.

1667
01:05:14,551 --> 01:05:16,021
(He says farewell to the members.)

1668
01:05:16,021 --> 01:05:17,181
See you, Gary.

1669
01:05:17,181 --> 01:05:19,281
- I'll see you next week. - Sure.

1670
01:05:19,281 --> 01:05:21,121
- See you. - Thank you.

1671
01:05:21,121 --> 01:05:23,521
- Goodbye. - Bye.

1672
01:05:23,521 --> 01:05:27,121
(He says farewell to everyone.)

1673
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:31,551
(He looks around.)

1674
01:05:31,551 --> 01:05:33,121
Why do you keep following me?

1675
01:05:33,421 --> 01:05:35,821
I have to pull myself together back in the studio.

1676
01:05:36,281 --> 01:05:38,521
Could we record a short video message of you?

1677
01:05:38,521 --> 01:05:39,681
A video message?

1678
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:42,551
We left the camera in your studio.

1679
01:05:42,551 --> 01:05:43,751
You haven't taken it yet?

1680
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:46,251
- I'd like to take it now. - Okay.

1681
01:05:46,951 --> 01:05:48,151
It's completely empty.

1682
01:05:49,881 --> 01:05:54,181
(Gary's back looks sad and lonely.)

1683
01:05:54,281 --> 01:05:56,481
(It feels empty.)

1684
01:05:58,951 --> 01:06:00,181
What's this?

1685
01:06:02,581 --> 01:06:04,981
(There's a big present in the middle of his studio.)

1686
01:06:05,821 --> 01:06:08,381
(What's this?)

1687
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:09,821
(He takes the card.)

1688
01:06:10,621 --> 01:06:12,481
"Six members excluding you..."

1689
01:06:13,351 --> 01:06:15,321
"were given..."

1690
01:06:16,251 --> 01:06:18,251
"a secret mission today."

1691
01:06:18,651 --> 01:06:23,251
"It was to steal an item that commemorated the time with you."

1692
01:06:23,251 --> 01:06:27,051
"They've returned the stolen items and only took the memories..."

1693
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:28,981
"they've had with you."

1694
01:06:29,681 --> 01:06:33,551
(The members gave presents to commemorate their times together.)

1695
01:06:33,551 --> 01:06:35,981
"Here's your last mission."

1696
01:06:36,621 --> 01:06:41,121
"Put the items back to where they were."

1697
01:06:43,781 --> 01:06:47,581
They stole items that were difficult to carry...

1698
01:06:48,121 --> 01:06:49,651
to remember them by.

1699
01:06:50,221 --> 01:06:51,451
Gosh, what's this?

1700
01:06:51,451 --> 01:06:53,381
(Is it a present?)

1701
01:06:53,381 --> 01:06:56,321
They left me presents where the stolen item...

1702
01:06:56,881 --> 01:06:58,551
used to be.

1703
01:06:58,951 --> 01:07:03,381
(Kwang Soo gave him speakers Gary always wanted to have.)

1704
01:07:03,381 --> 01:07:05,181
(He also wrote him a letter.)

1705
01:07:05,181 --> 01:07:06,881
It's a handwritten letter.

1706
01:07:06,881 --> 01:07:11,081
"Dear Gary, I still can't believe that you're leaving."

1707
01:07:11,081 --> 01:07:15,251
"I regret that I haven't expressed enough of my love, gratitude..."

1708
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,851
"and apologies to you."

1709
01:07:19,281 --> 01:07:20,581
I'll read it later.

1710
01:07:20,781 --> 01:07:22,221
If I read it now,

1711
01:07:23,281 --> 01:07:24,851
I might get tearful.

1712
01:07:27,451 --> 01:07:29,951
I won't get to see you every Monday from now on,

1713
01:07:30,451 --> 01:07:32,251
but we're already a family.

1714
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:34,821
I'll call you more, and I hope that...

1715
01:07:34,951 --> 01:07:36,621
we see each other more often.

1716
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:41,081
Kwang Soo, I love you.

1717
01:07:41,821 --> 01:07:44,651
(He's grateful to Gary for being there for him.)

1718
01:07:44,651 --> 01:07:46,251
Dear Gary,

1719
01:07:46,681 --> 01:07:49,321
thank you so much. I love you forever.

1720
01:07:49,681 --> 01:07:51,181
It's from Jong Kook.

1721
01:07:51,221 --> 01:07:54,021
(Gary and Jong Kook are close.)

1722
01:07:54,021 --> 01:07:55,581
"Gary, you know how I feel."

1723
01:07:55,921 --> 01:07:58,581
"It's so difficult to write a letter like this to you."

1724
01:07:59,681 --> 01:08:02,821
You worked hard for a long time. Stay healthy.

1725
01:08:02,851 --> 01:08:04,321
Good luck in everything you do.

1726
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:07,351
We'll still see each other, so let's not be sad.

1727
01:08:07,481 --> 01:08:10,451
I bought you some cosmetics so please become handsome.

1728
01:08:10,821 --> 01:08:12,721
I hope you will transform.

1729
01:08:14,121 --> 01:08:15,551
Gosh, Seok Jin.

1730
01:08:16,721 --> 01:08:20,281
(Why did he steal this?)

1731
01:08:20,581 --> 01:08:22,191
(Seok Jin's present is red ginseng.)

1732
01:08:22,191 --> 01:08:23,281
Goodness.

1733
01:08:23,281 --> 01:08:24,421
(Seok Jin's present is red ginseng.)

1734
01:08:24,421 --> 01:08:28,481
Isn't this a gift he received on Chuseok?

1735
01:08:28,481 --> 01:08:29,621
(It looks like a Chuseok present.)

1736
01:08:29,651 --> 01:08:32,221
Gary, I still can't believe it.

1737
01:08:32,451 --> 01:08:36,251
During the last seven years, we talked about many things.

1738
01:08:36,481 --> 01:08:40,351
We shared a room together during mud games...

1739
01:08:40,421 --> 01:08:42,051
and waited for our turns to shower.

1740
01:08:42,121 --> 01:08:45,321
On one hand, I was angry when I heard that you're quitting.

1741
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:49,821
But I also understood you, so I was confused about what I felt.

1742
01:08:50,451 --> 01:08:52,751
I'll have to respect your wish.

1743
01:08:53,051 --> 01:08:54,521
I love you, Gary.

1744
01:08:56,581 --> 01:08:57,781
I still remember this...

1745
01:08:58,781 --> 01:09:03,021
about Haha. We were in a car together.

1746
01:09:03,021 --> 01:09:06,081
I told him that I was invited to join Running Man.

1747
01:09:06,321 --> 01:09:09,121
Then I asked him if he's also joining, and he said yes.

1748
01:09:09,691 --> 01:09:12,921
I told him that I was worried as I've never been on a variety show.

1749
01:09:13,321 --> 01:09:14,481
I didn't know what I should do.

1750
01:09:14,621 --> 01:09:17,751
I wanted to remain a musician at the time,

1751
01:09:17,751 --> 01:09:19,481
but this is what he told me.

1752
01:09:19,481 --> 01:09:20,481
(Haha said...)

1753
01:09:20,481 --> 01:09:22,551
He said that if I'm also good at doing variety shows,

1754
01:09:23,621 --> 01:09:28,421
I shouldn't shy away from it.

1755
01:09:28,521 --> 01:09:30,691
I still remember him saying that.

1756
01:09:30,691 --> 01:09:33,951
We were in the back seat of a car at a gas station.

1757
01:09:33,951 --> 01:09:35,481
(Haha's words brought Gary to Running Man.)

1758
01:09:35,481 --> 01:09:37,251
It's very light.

1759
01:09:38,951 --> 01:09:40,421
Gosh!

1760
01:09:41,351 --> 01:09:43,821
(Haha got him three dried squids.)

1761
01:09:43,821 --> 01:09:46,221
Gary, I can't believe it.

1762
01:09:46,221 --> 01:09:48,421
When the ratings weren't that high in the beginning of Running Man,

1763
01:09:48,421 --> 01:09:51,521
we spent the night at Han River. We prayed for things...

1764
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:55,021
to turn out well at my house. We rolled on the floor laughing.

1765
01:09:55,151 --> 01:09:58,021
I miss the times when we dreamed while drinking soju.

1766
01:09:58,021 --> 01:10:00,481
I hope you'll be healthy...

1767
01:10:00,621 --> 01:10:03,521
and have a wonderful family after you get married.

1768
01:10:03,751 --> 01:10:05,221
Let's get old together.

1769
01:10:05,781 --> 01:10:08,281
- I love you. - You're my role model.

1770
01:10:08,281 --> 01:10:09,721
I love you.

1771
01:10:10,121 --> 01:10:12,981
I love you. From Haha who's more handsome than you.

1772
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:18,621
(He remembers each of his precious memories.)

1773
01:10:18,621 --> 01:10:20,521
(He finds a present from Jae Seok.)

1774
01:10:20,521 --> 01:10:22,781
Goodness, what's this?

1775
01:10:22,921 --> 01:10:25,621
(Jae Seok gave him sneakers for his new journey.)

1776
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:29,351
"Gary, it's been seven years since we've been on Running Man together."

1777
01:10:29,751 --> 01:10:33,691
Gary, I'll think of you during next week's recording.

1778
01:10:34,081 --> 01:10:37,781
As I know what you want to achieve in the future,

1779
01:10:37,781 --> 01:10:42,881
the other members and I support you in all of your endeavours.

1780
01:10:42,881 --> 01:10:45,951
Call me any time you want to be back on a variety show.

1781
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:48,021
Okay, Gary? See you.

1782
01:10:48,281 --> 01:10:50,691
It's too embarrassing for me to continue, so I stop here.

1783
01:10:50,691 --> 01:10:53,281
See you again. I'll call you. You did a good job.

1784
01:10:54,981 --> 01:10:59,121
(The only item that remains is the plant.)

1785
01:11:00,781 --> 01:11:02,321
Gosh, Ji Hyo.

1786
01:11:03,381 --> 01:11:05,751
(His heart feels as heavy as the plant.)

1787
01:11:05,751 --> 01:11:07,421
My dear Ji Hyo.

1788
01:11:07,421 --> 01:11:08,881
(His heart feels as heavy as the plant.)

1789
01:11:10,321 --> 01:11:12,421
There are two presents from her.

1790
01:11:12,481 --> 01:11:14,691
She gave me an electronic massager.

1791
01:11:14,691 --> 01:11:18,781
I often get muscle pains because I have spinal disc herniation.

1792
01:11:19,381 --> 01:11:22,191
She used to massage my shoulders at times...

1793
01:11:22,191 --> 01:11:24,451
during the recording...

1794
01:11:24,621 --> 01:11:27,191
and stretched my lower back.

1795
01:11:28,921 --> 01:11:30,981
Since she won't be around, she gave me this.

1796
01:11:34,551 --> 01:11:40,321
(Ji Hyo's second present is...)

1797
01:11:40,351 --> 01:11:46,721
(a photo album of Monday Couple.)

1798
01:11:46,981 --> 01:11:48,281
I remember this time.

1799
01:11:48,321 --> 01:11:51,821
(He remembers a photo.)

1800
01:11:51,881 --> 01:11:56,251
I remember that she said I could be such a handful.

1801
01:11:57,121 --> 01:11:59,451
I still remember her saying that.

1802
01:11:59,451 --> 01:12:01,781
You can be such a handful!

1803
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:06,051
We have to stay together in spirit.

1804
01:12:06,051 --> 01:12:12,781
(Gary and Ji Hyo looked the best when they were together.)

1805
01:12:15,051 --> 01:12:18,021
Gary, this is Ji Hyo.

1806
01:12:19,351 --> 01:12:23,921
I was very shocked when I heard that you're leaving,

1807
01:12:23,951 --> 01:12:26,221
so I was in a daze for a few days.

1808
01:12:26,781 --> 01:12:29,191
I took for granted...

1809
01:12:29,191 --> 01:12:32,191
that until the very end, which we don't know when,

1810
01:12:32,191 --> 01:12:36,121
all of us would stay on this show.

1811
01:12:36,421 --> 01:12:38,691
Perhaps, I was lost in that belief.

1812
01:12:40,521 --> 01:12:43,191
I was upset and cried,

1813
01:12:43,551 --> 01:12:44,981
but now that I think about it,

1814
01:12:45,081 --> 01:12:48,881
I realised how difficult it must have been for you...

1815
01:12:49,321 --> 01:12:51,951
to make such a decision.

1816
01:12:52,851 --> 01:12:55,921
I'm sorry about the things that I didn't know about.

1817
01:12:55,921 --> 01:12:59,521
I felt bad thinking about how hard it must have been for you.

1818
01:12:59,581 --> 01:13:03,281
Now that you won't be where you always used to be...

1819
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:05,821
for the last seven years, I'll feel sad and lonely,

1820
01:13:05,951 --> 01:13:08,191
but I'll stay strong.

1821
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:10,581
"I'll stay strong."

1822
01:13:10,581 --> 01:13:13,081
"If you miss us too much,"

1823
01:13:13,081 --> 01:13:14,651
"come back any time."

1824
01:13:15,481 --> 01:13:19,551
"No one can fill your place where you've been..."

1825
01:13:19,981 --> 01:13:22,451
"for the last seven years, so I'll leave it for you."

1826
01:13:23,081 --> 01:13:27,451
(They were special to each other.)

1827
01:13:27,451 --> 01:13:29,881
Hello, it's nice to see you. This is Gary.

1828
01:13:29,881 --> 01:13:33,821
I'm here to say my last farewell.

1829
01:13:33,881 --> 01:13:36,081
I was a singer...

1830
01:13:36,581 --> 01:13:39,821
that no one recognised,

1831
01:13:39,821 --> 01:13:42,081
but as I was on Running Man,

1832
01:13:42,081 --> 01:13:45,651
people started to find out about me...

1833
01:13:45,651 --> 01:13:47,351
and I received a lot of support.

1834
01:13:47,451 --> 01:13:48,781
I lacked in many ways,

1835
01:13:49,021 --> 01:13:52,851
but please keep watching Running Man since there are still...

1836
01:13:52,851 --> 01:13:55,721
other members and the staff who work hard for this show.

1837
01:13:55,781 --> 01:13:58,751
Please love the show as usual.

1838
01:13:58,781 --> 01:14:00,191
Wherever I go,

1839
01:14:00,191 --> 01:14:03,691
I'll try my best to live up to your expectations.

1840
01:14:04,191 --> 01:14:06,251
I really appreciate it. I've had a wonderful time so far.

1841
01:14:06,251 --> 01:14:07,691
Take care. Thank you.

1842
01:14:07,691 --> 01:14:09,421
(The 324 episodes, 2311 days and 77,000km with you...)

1843
01:14:09,421 --> 01:14:10,581
(won't be forgotten.)

1844
01:14:12,081 --> 01:14:16,651
(Like so, our beautiful goodbyes to Gary...)

1845
01:14:16,691 --> 01:14:18,221
(did not happen.)

1846
01:14:18,221 --> 01:14:20,481
Stop it! Leave me alone.

1847
01:14:20,481 --> 01:14:22,051
You're so mean to me.
