1
00:00:03,311 --> 00:00:06,951
(Previously on Running Man...)

2
00:00:07,281 --> 00:00:08,881
This is the last shooting with Gary.

3
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:10,681
I know. Goodness.

4
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:12,781
("Gary leaves Running Man to focus on his music.")

5
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:15,981
I support you in all of your endeavours.

6
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:17,051
- Good luck. - Okay.

7
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:19,581
I had a great time with all of you. Please take care.

8
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:20,581
Thank you.

9
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:29,181
(Like so, our beautiful goodbyes to Gary...)

10
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:30,281
(did not happen.)

11
00:00:30,951 --> 00:00:32,511
(We wouldn't let him leave us so easily.)

12
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:34,311
- Gary! - Gary!

13
00:00:34,311 --> 00:00:36,481
(Gary, we still need you.)

14
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:39,311
(We need Gary to fill in his lack of presence.)

15
00:00:39,311 --> 00:00:40,851
It's Monday. Let's go for shooting.

16
00:00:40,851 --> 00:00:41,951
My goodness.

17
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:44,481
(Let's begin Lack of Gary Trip.)

18
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:48,851
(At Dosan Park in Apgujeong)

19
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:54,051
(A week after Gary left, on a sunny day)

20
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:56,481
I was startled when I saw the preview.

21
00:00:56,611 --> 00:00:59,251
So Gary believes he quit the show, but we haven't let him go, right?

22
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:00,311
Will he really show up today?

23
00:01:00,581 --> 00:01:03,011
They made the preview very nicely. It made me so curious.

24
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:07,681
(Like so, our beautiful goodbyes to Gary...)

25
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:08,881
(did not happen.)

26
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:11,351
Stop it! Leave me alone.

27
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:12,951
You're so mean to me.

28
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:15,381
Will he really come?

29
00:01:15,381 --> 00:01:17,781
Even if he does, he won't get paid, right?

30
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:19,211
- He'll be our guest. - A guest?

31
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:20,951
He'll get paid as a guest.

32
00:01:20,951 --> 00:01:25,051
Thinking of our long friendship, he doesn't need to be paid.

33
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:26,951
Why don't you also...

34
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:28,211
get paid for only three episodes a month?

35
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:31,081
Gary quit voluntarily, so this must be a follow-up service instead.

36
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:32,581
- I see. - You got it?

37
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:33,951
He quit the show voluntarily.

38
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:35,511
- What is this? - He's here.

39
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:36,811
- Is he here to sell things? - What is that?

40
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:38,481
- Gosh. - Jae Seok.

41
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:46,811
(A mysterious street merchant, a local Jae Seok)

42
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:50,881
(If you are sad after Gary left, I'll make you happy.)

43
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:52,581
We won't buy any!

44
00:01:52,581 --> 00:01:54,181
(We won't buy any!)

45
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:55,751
I said we don't need any!

46
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:57,451
I hate him.

47
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:00,251
- We don't need any. - Look at him.

48
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:02,181
- Is he a guide today? - What is that in your hand?

49
00:02:02,181 --> 00:02:03,821
- It is... - Is he a guide for sightseeing?

50
00:02:03,821 --> 00:02:05,611
- Everyone. - Yes?

51
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:07,851
- This is... - Is Gary inside?

52
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:09,351
(Gary to-go)

53
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:12,251
- That's ridiculous. - He's like a street merchant.

54
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:14,321
I think Gary will come out of it.

55
00:02:14,321 --> 00:02:16,051
By the way,

56
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:17,911
I'll take you around...

57
00:02:18,081 --> 00:02:21,351
Apgujeong-dong as your guide today.

58
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:24,511
We'll visit places where we have memories.

59
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,821
- Places with memories? - Yes.

60
00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:27,281
You mean the places with your memories?

61
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:28,381
Our memories.

62
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,181
- Why do we have to go with you? - It must be just your memories.

63
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:34,211
I'll feed you and everything, so just follow me.

64
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:37,611
- Just follow me. - We have money for lunch.

65
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:38,851
Do we look like beggars?

66
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:41,711
- Seok Jin. - Yes

67
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:42,951
(He forces others to wear uniforms.)

68
00:02:42,951 --> 00:02:44,411
- Ji Hyo. - Yes.

69
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:46,681
I might also have memories in those places.

70
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:48,981
- I think so. - Right.

71
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:51,681
Everyone, are you all sad after Gary left?

72
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:53,151
- I am. - Right, he's not here.

73
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:55,511
- Goodness. - I almost forgot.

74
00:02:55,511 --> 00:02:57,081
- You all are cruel. - Goodness.

75
00:02:57,251 --> 00:02:58,251
I knew it.

76
00:02:58,281 --> 00:03:00,081
- So we prepared a race... - Yes.

77
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:03,711
where you can dispel the sadness.

78
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,881
It's called Lack of Gary Trip, "Get Some Air".

79
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:08,081
"Get Some Air"?

80
00:03:08,581 --> 00:03:11,081
- Please just let him go. - Goodness.

81
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:12,511
- Gary... - Let him live freely.

82
00:03:12,511 --> 00:03:14,451
- You're so clingy. - Just let him go!

83
00:03:14,451 --> 00:03:17,051
We thought you all feel sad after he left.

84
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:20,911
So we prepared an Apgujeong Tour...

85
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:23,081
which Jae Seok recommended.

86
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:24,311
Before we begin...

87
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,281
(Look what we've prepared.)

88
00:03:28,081 --> 00:03:29,411
There's a fixed plan.

89
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:31,481
- Chinese restaurant! - That's famous.

90
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:33,451
- You know this restaurant. - The food there is great.

91
00:03:33,451 --> 00:03:34,611
I think you told me about it.

92
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,381
They ignored you, right?

93
00:03:36,381 --> 00:03:38,181
- Right. - You have a sad memory there.

94
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:41,451
I cried a lot back then.

95
00:03:41,451 --> 00:03:42,651
This is a place with a sad memory.

96
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:45,281
I wanted to go to this restaurant often,

97
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:48,851
- but I was financially strained. - The dishes there were expensive.

98
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:52,081
We couldn't go often because the food there was expensive.

99
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:55,151
This restaurant is well known for serving tasty dishes.

100
00:03:55,681 --> 00:03:57,581
This is a cafe I went a lot.

101
00:03:57,581 --> 00:03:58,811
- You know which one it is. - Which one is it?

102
00:03:58,811 --> 00:03:59,811
What's the name of it?

103
00:04:00,051 --> 00:04:01,681
I know! They have great cakes.

104
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:04,581
- You know, too, right? - I do. They have tasty cakes.

105
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,781
- Many celebrities visited there. - Right.

106
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:08,951
- There were so many celebrities. - Right.

107
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:11,081
Next, we'll go to a karaoke.

108
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:12,851
And it has become rare, but...

109
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:14,451
- Photo stickers? - Yes.

110
00:04:14,451 --> 00:04:15,781
(So nostalgic)

111
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:17,351
It's widespread these days again.

112
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:19,151
- It's increasing. - Right.

113
00:04:19,251 --> 00:04:21,481
We all have been to Han River. It's a must place for dates.

114
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:22,651
Wait a second.

115
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:24,851
(Jae Seok shouted directly at Seok Jin's ear.)

116
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:26,781
- Gosh. - Why are you using it?

117
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:27,881
Do you need it in the first place?

118
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:29,711
This is what other guides use.

119
00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:32,411
- You all know that, right? - It's too loud.

120
00:04:32,781 --> 00:04:35,121
I like that. Keep using it. It actually hides your mouth.

121
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:37,951
- You're right. - Covering his mouth looks better.

122
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:40,151
Why don't you use this, too? It will make your eyes look bigger.

123
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:41,151
(Speak for yourself.)

124
00:04:41,551 --> 00:04:43,411
- Are you serious? - Yes. Get one, just like me.

125
00:04:43,411 --> 00:04:44,911
My goodness.

126
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,081
Why don't you hide your ugly big nose with this?

127
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:49,411
- He's making a good use of it. - Hey, stop it.

128
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:51,251
Anyway, this is today's course.

129
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:53,051
- Okay. - We will visit a number of places.

130
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:55,181
I could've introduced more places, but I'm sad I can't.

131
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:57,181
I'm sorry that we don't have enough time to visit all those places.

132
00:04:57,181 --> 00:04:59,351
You couldn't bring us there because we can't film the place.

133
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:00,351
(Because such places are not appropriate to broadcast.)

134
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:02,351
- Oh, was that what you meant? - What are you talking about?

135
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:04,551
- Am I wrong? - Such places aren't opened yet.

136
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:06,681
- I'm pretty sure they aren't. - Are you out of your mind?

137
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,881
- So they must be closed by now. - Anyway,

138
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:12,411
you must finish all the course in six hours.

139
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:14,811
- In 6 hours. - What? 6 hours?

140
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:16,511
After six hours,

141
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:19,711
you will be penalised according to the number of uncompleted courses.

142
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:21,381
Do we have missions in each place?

143
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:23,381
They penalise me more than my school teachers did.

144
00:05:23,911 --> 00:05:25,751
We will provide you with...

145
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:29,181
money, a phone and a car for your mission.

146
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:31,081
- Really? That sounds nice. - Will you provide us a car, too?

147
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,711
As you know, lacking is the theme of today's tour,

148
00:05:33,711 --> 00:05:36,651
so we will give you six dollars each.

149
00:05:36,651 --> 00:05:39,511
Because as of 2016, the minimum wage in Korea is 6 dollars per hour.

150
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:43,851
As there are six of you, we will give you 36 dollars altogether.

151
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:44,881
36 dollars for all of us?

152
00:05:44,881 --> 00:05:46,281
- Yes. - Are you serious?

153
00:05:46,281 --> 00:05:48,181
- What can we do with 36 dollars? - We can barely pay for our lunch...

154
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,381
- with 36 dollars. - We can't pay all with 36 dollars.

155
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:53,611
The remaining battery of your phones is seven percent.

156
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:55,411
- Is it to represent the members? - Our phone?

157
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:57,811
- Are they serious about this? - For your car,

158
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:00,411
I'm sure that the petrol warning light is flashing.

159
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:03,051
- We don't have gas, either? - Why are you doing this?

160
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:04,611
Why are you so harsh?

161
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:07,781
- What's the reason? - Apgujeong is small. Let's walk.

162
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:09,451
- We have a time limit. - Ji Hyo's right.

163
00:06:09,451 --> 00:06:11,111
- We have to move as fast as we can. - I see.

164
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:13,051
You have to pay for the parking if you decide to ride the car.

165
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:15,381
- Are you serious? - We can talk out of it.

166
00:06:15,611 --> 00:06:16,651
What do you mean?

167
00:06:16,651 --> 00:06:19,311
- Let's talk to the manager. - Don't park the car.

168
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:22,051
- Run the car around the place. - We don't have enough gas.

169
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:23,381
Let's keep one person in the car.

170
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:24,411
We don't have petrol.

171
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:25,851
People will take photos and report us.

172
00:06:26,281 --> 00:06:28,151
Why don't we sell the car?

173
00:06:28,151 --> 00:06:29,981
- Where can we sell it? - That's a good idea.

174
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:31,781
- It is a nice idea. - Let's sell the car...

175
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:35,681
Instead, you will be given a mission at each destination.

176
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:39,111
We will give you some advantages with the fees you need to pay...

177
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:40,981
if you successfully complete the mission.

178
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:45,211
Before the tour, let us take your wallets and phones.

179
00:06:45,211 --> 00:06:47,811
- I need to check the stocks. - I didn't bring my wallet here.

180
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:50,311
- Are they serious? - Are they really taking our phones?

181
00:06:50,311 --> 00:06:52,581
(The staff members collect their phones and wallets before the tour.)

182
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:55,511
- I didn't bring my wallet. - Why do you check my pocket?

183
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:57,281
- It will be really fun. - All right. Let's go.

184
00:06:57,351 --> 00:07:00,251
- Let's go, everyone. - Don't betray us today.

185
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:01,351
I swear I won't.

186
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:03,151
- I'm not a thief. - Really?

187
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:05,151
I can't trust you.

188
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:07,211
(Will they be able to complete the tour without any problems?)

189
00:07:07,651 --> 00:07:09,451
- Check the battery. - We're really running out of it.

190
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:11,751
- I mean check the petrol level. - We don't have much gas left.

191
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:14,481
- Is it nearly empty? - Yes, it is.

192
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,881
- We're running out of gas. - What we should do now is...

193
00:07:17,881 --> 00:07:20,111
The phone's running out of battery. It has only 6 percent left.

194
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:21,581
- Turn it off for now. - Should I?

195
00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:23,051
- Turn on the power saving mode. - Yes. I should.

196
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:25,951
Yes. Turn on the power saving mode. Keep the brightness to minimum.

197
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,181
All right.

198
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:30,181
I'm hungry. I'm really starving now.

199
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:31,811
How should we park the car?

200
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:33,451
I think they have valet parking.

201
00:07:33,451 --> 00:07:34,511
We have to pay for it, too.

202
00:07:34,681 --> 00:07:37,311
- We have a mission there. - Let's get in and see.

203
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:38,451
All right. Let's get in there.

204
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:42,951
(They arrived their first course, the Chinese restaurant.)

205
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:44,981
- This restaurant is really old. - Yes, it is.

206
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:47,351
- This restaurant is quite old. - I haven't been here for some time.

207
00:07:47,351 --> 00:07:48,651
I remember this place.

208
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:51,081
- Hello. Good to see you. - Hello.

209
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:52,611
I feel hungry already.

210
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:55,451
- It smells really delicious. - I can smell the food already.

211
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:56,911
- Gosh. - The smell is really nice.

212
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:58,151
I want to eat a lot today.

213
00:07:58,151 --> 00:08:00,851
Forget the price. The menus are worth every cent.

214
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:03,181
Before we begin, please choose the menu.

215
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:05,551
- You cannot enjoy if you care... - Do we have to choose one?

216
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,781
- What is this? - Please choose one.

217
00:08:07,781 --> 00:08:09,281
- Is between A and B? - Yes, it is.

218
00:08:09,611 --> 00:08:10,751
- Let's choose A. - A sounds better.

219
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,551
We must choose B, then.

220
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:15,011
We must choose the opposite of Kwang Soo's choice.

221
00:08:15,181 --> 00:08:16,511
I want A.

222
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:17,711
Then let's choose A.

223
00:08:17,711 --> 00:08:20,051
The Unlucky Trio chose A.

224
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:21,611
- What should we do? - Jae Seok.

225
00:08:21,611 --> 00:08:23,451
Let's do rock-paper-scissors and let the winner choose.

226
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:24,511
- Okay. - Rock-paper-scissors?

227
00:08:24,511 --> 00:08:26,581
- All right. - Rock-paper-scissors.

228
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,951
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

229
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:30,881
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

230
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,881
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

231
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:36,081
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Who's the odd one?

232
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:39,221
- Jong Kook is the odd one. - You're the problem.

233
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:40,721
It's not ending because of you.

234
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,311
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Is it really my fault?

235
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:43,451
- Is it? - Okay.

236
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:44,551
(Finally,)

237
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:46,311
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin win.)

238
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:47,781
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Okay.

239
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:50,051
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Okay. I'll choose A.

240
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:52,151
(Seok Jin chooses menu A.)

241
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:53,581
Shall I open it now?

242
00:08:53,581 --> 00:08:55,081
(It doesn't feel good...)

243
00:08:55,581 --> 00:08:56,581
Menu A looks nice.

244
00:08:57,051 --> 00:08:58,111
(Menu A is filled with typical Chinese Restaurant dishes.)

245
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,181
It looks good.

246
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:01,651
- Menu A is better than menu B. - Okay.

247
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:04,281
- Good job. - All right.

248
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:06,551
- I'll tell you the price. - Okay.

249
00:09:06,551 --> 00:09:07,651
Menu A costs...

250
00:09:08,651 --> 00:09:10,351
29 dollars.

251
00:09:10,481 --> 00:09:11,881
(What?)

252
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:13,451
Menu A costs 29 dollars.

253
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,581
After paying, we would only have 7 dollars left.

254
00:09:14,781 --> 00:09:16,651
- Wait. How about this menu? - How much is Menu B?

255
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:18,511
- Menu B costs 9 dollars. - Gosh.

256
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:20,011
- Wait. - I should've chose B instead of A.

257
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:21,511
- Must we eat the menu we choose? - Do we have to pay 29 dollars each?

258
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:23,781
- It's 29 dollars altogether. - Altogether? It sounds nice.

259
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:25,681
- Let's go for it. - Let's eat first and think later.

260
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:27,081
- Let's have an extra jjajangmyeon. - We must eat.

261
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:28,851
- No, we shouldn't. - I don't care any more.

262
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:29,881
No.

263
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:30,881
- No. - Let's eat first.

264
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:32,611
- Seok Jin chose it already. - No, we must not.

265
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:35,681
- What do you mean? - If you win a mission here,

266
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:37,721
you'll only have to pay half the price.

267
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:39,081
- Yes. - Now, it sounds good.

268
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:41,051
- Good. - Yes. We can afford it.

269
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:42,611
- All right. Let's eat. - By the way,

270
00:09:42,611 --> 00:09:44,281
- Let's eat and think later. - this is the place where...

271
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:47,581
Seok Jin and I used to visit.

272
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:48,751
We ate here often.

273
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:50,481
Seok Jin, where did you live back then?

274
00:09:50,481 --> 00:09:51,651
- Suyuri. - I lived in Suyuri.

275
00:09:51,651 --> 00:09:52,881
Why did you come here in the first place?

276
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:54,481
I was living in Suyuri, too.

277
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:57,951
This is where the youngsters used to hang out.

278
00:09:57,951 --> 00:10:00,481
It's like you, who live in Anyang, coming all the way to Apgujeong.

279
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:02,811
It's different. I don't come here to hang out.

280
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:04,581
You watched a movie with Kwang Soo last time. Didn't you?

281
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:07,451
- Yes, you did. - Oh, gosh.

282
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:09,181
You did, right? You were wearing a mask...

283
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:10,881
- My goodness. - and a hoodie to cover your face.

284
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:12,581
You were wearing shorts, too. Wasn't it you?

285
00:10:12,581 --> 00:10:14,251
- How do you know that? - I was wearing shorts, but how?

286
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:16,111
- The photo doesn't show my shorts. - One of my friends told me.

287
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:19,051
A guy who certainly looked like Jong Kook was covering his face.

288
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,511
He knew right on the spot that it was you, Jong Kook.

289
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:23,951
- Our figures must be distinctive. - I guess so.

290
00:10:24,051 --> 00:10:26,311
- Last time in Anyang, - Yes.

291
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:28,651
it was after shooting Running Man.

292
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:30,811
I was in Anyang. I covered myself with clothes completely...

293
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:33,851
- and entered a restaurant. - The one you usually go?

294
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:35,581
Yes. I was sure that I was completely covered,

295
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:38,111
but people recognised me. People laughed when they saw me.

296
00:10:38,111 --> 00:10:40,111
I thought, "How do they know?"

297
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:42,781
I thought it was because of my stylist, who dyed his hair yellow.

298
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:45,311
So I blamed him. "People found out because of your hair colour!"

299
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,511
How did people really find out?

300
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:48,151
I had my name tag on my back.

301
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:49,511
(Everyone could find out who he was without any effort.)

302
00:10:49,511 --> 00:10:51,811
- You covered yourself completely. - Yes. Completely with my clothes.

303
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:54,881
I was eating hot soup. I sweated a lot.

304
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:56,311
- Did you sweat? - Yes.

305
00:10:56,451 --> 00:10:58,511
It was winter. I was wearing a thick winter jacket...

306
00:10:58,511 --> 00:10:59,811
- with my name tag on. - That's why people laughed.

307
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:01,411
- Hello. - Thank you.

308
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:04,281
- I recognise you. - Do you still work here?

309
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:05,681
My goodness.

310
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:07,251
- Hello. - Do you still work here?

311
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,081
- How long have you worked here? - For 31 years.

312
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:10,511
- 31 years? - I know him.

313
00:11:10,511 --> 00:11:11,811
He was the waiter here 20 years ago.

314
00:11:11,811 --> 00:11:14,111
- Amazing. - Really.

315
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:15,751
- So he worked here for 31 years? - Unbelievable.

316
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:17,011
Thank you.

317
00:11:17,151 --> 00:11:18,811
Gosh.

318
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,251
- Are you a manager now? - Yes. I'm in charge of this place.

319
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:23,281
- He's the manager now. - Of course.

320
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:25,281
He served us 20 years ago. I can still recognise his face.

321
00:11:25,281 --> 00:11:26,911
- That's amazing. - Yes. I remember you, too.

322
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:29,751
- Do you remember us? - I'm on your side.

323
00:11:30,251 --> 00:11:32,151
- You are? - Do you mean, you're our fan?

324
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:35,551
- He must be nervous. - He seems so.

325
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:38,251
- He is nervous. - Usually,

326
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:39,851
he's very calm and confident.

327
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:42,281
He must be nervous to stand in front of the camera.

328
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:44,681
When he said he was on Jae Seok and Seok Jin's side,

329
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:46,781
I first thought he was the substitute for Gary.

330
00:11:46,781 --> 00:11:47,781
(It would've been surprising if he really was.)

331
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:49,651
- It's good to see him again. - It's really nice.

332
00:11:49,811 --> 00:11:52,281
- You still serve your customers. - Back then,

333
00:11:52,281 --> 00:11:54,611
we were not famous. You wouldn't remember us.

334
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:56,181
He may remember you as terrible customers.

335
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:58,881
- No, we weren't. - If 3 of you ordered only 1 dish...

336
00:11:58,881 --> 00:12:00,811
We were so poor. We couldn't order many dishes.

337
00:12:00,811 --> 00:12:02,481
- How did you know, Jong Kook? - I was correct, wasn't I?

338
00:12:02,481 --> 00:12:05,381
I once visited here with 3 other friends and ordered only 2 dishes.

339
00:12:05,481 --> 00:12:06,951
- It happened to me, too. - You didn't have enough money.

340
00:12:07,011 --> 00:12:08,911
If you were poor, why did you come here in the first place?

341
00:12:09,451 --> 00:12:10,481
- Am I wrong? - He came to eat jjajangmyeon.

342
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:12,911
- I wanted to eat jjajangmyeon. - Why did you come all the way here?

343
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:14,651
Also...

344
00:12:15,781 --> 00:12:17,511
Their tangsuyuk looks different.

345
00:12:18,381 --> 00:12:20,181
It looks sumptuous.

346
00:12:20,881 --> 00:12:22,551
- It really is. - It looks delicious.

347
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,651
- Thank you. - All right. Let's eat.

348
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:27,111
- Can I have some? - This jjajangmyeon looks amazing.

349
00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:29,811
- We have jjamppong, too. - This jjamppong looks delicious.

350
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:30,811
(They are served a full course of Chinese cuisine.)

351
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:32,481
- Do you want this? - Yes. Let's swap the dishes.

352
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,151
- We made the right decision. - Let's order another jjajangmyeon.

353
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,711
I want to taste both jjajangmyeon and jjamppong.

354
00:12:40,111 --> 00:12:41,451
- Side dishes taste great, too. - Yes.

355
00:12:41,451 --> 00:12:43,081
You can't have more than one bite.

356
00:12:43,151 --> 00:12:44,911
- Can't I eat twice? Really? - Come on. I never tasted that one.

357
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:47,381
- I haven't eaten it yet. - You ate twice. Didn't you?

358
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:48,551
- Stop eating. - Ji Hyo, you should eat instead.

359
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:50,481
- I haven't even tasted it yet. - Seok Jin is acting greedy.

360
00:12:50,481 --> 00:12:52,881
- You must stop eating this. - Let Haha eat.

361
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,911
Look. This dish is really small.

362
00:12:54,981 --> 00:12:56,751
- Hurry up. - Stop eating, you jerk.

363
00:12:56,751 --> 00:12:58,111
Did you just call me "jerk"?

364
00:12:58,251 --> 00:13:00,211
- You had it already, Seok Jin. - Hey.

365
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:02,181
- Don't be greedy. Let Haha eat it. - What are you doing?

366
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,451
- Stop it. - Give it to Haha. He should try it.

367
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:05,611
- Haha. - You ate this jjamppong too much.

368
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:06,851
Hey. I haven't tasted it yet.

369
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:08,711
- Seok Jin. Let me eat some. - Here, Haha.

370
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:10,351
What do you mean? You ate this jjamppong already.

371
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:12,051
Don't you think you had enough?

372
00:13:12,051 --> 00:13:13,711
- Please. - Hey. Stop it.

373
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:16,311
Stop it and wait there. I'll give you some.

374
00:13:16,911 --> 00:13:18,051
Seok Jin, come on.

375
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:20,881
- That's enough. Go. - I'm 32 years old.

376
00:13:20,881 --> 00:13:24,081
- You're 32? So what? - I'm as young as your son.

377
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:26,251
- That's too much. - Yes, I know.

378
00:13:26,781 --> 00:13:28,351
- You can't be his son. No way. - Come on, Seok Jin.

379
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:30,051
- You're too old to be my son. - You know what I mean.

380
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:31,051
- Just give me some more. - All right.

381
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:32,611
- I'll give you more. - His son is in middle school.

382
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,111
Shall we order some extra rice and mix with the sauce?

383
00:13:35,151 --> 00:13:36,651
- That sounds like a good idea. - I'm still hungry.

384
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:37,911
Is plain rice okay?

385
00:13:37,911 --> 00:13:39,181
- It reminds me of my old days. - Your old days?

386
00:13:39,181 --> 00:13:41,411
- Yes, let's go for rice. - When we were young,

387
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:43,551
few bowls of jjajangmyeon weren't enough to satisfy our hunger.

388
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,111
- So we ordered extra rice. - We mixed rice with sauce.

389
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,111
- That's right. - A cup of rice is one dollar.

390
00:13:48,111 --> 00:13:49,611
We'll add it to your bill.

391
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:50,851
It costs only 50 cents if we pay half the price.

392
00:13:50,851 --> 00:13:53,381
We must eat well for today.

393
00:13:54,351 --> 00:13:55,751
This jjajang rice tastes delicious.

394
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,011
(They find it really delicious because they are hungry.)

395
00:13:58,611 --> 00:13:59,681
(Goodness)

396
00:13:59,911 --> 00:14:01,211
It was a great idea to order extra rice.

397
00:14:01,711 --> 00:14:03,511
Have a taste. This tastes amazing.

398
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:05,281
This rice is so good.

399
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:08,811
(With 30 dollars, they find true happiness.)

400
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:10,611
- This tastes amazing. - It's delicious.

401
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:14,181
(Was jjajang rice always this good?)

402
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:16,251
- It's amazing. - This tastes really delicious.

403
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:18,881
How was your meal?

404
00:14:19,011 --> 00:14:22,211
Not enough. The meal was too small.

405
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:23,281
It was great.

406
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:25,711
If you're done eating, then it's time to settle your bill.

407
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:27,451
- How much is it? - You have to pay 30 dollars.

408
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:29,551
- How much do we have now? - 36 dollars.

409
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:34,481
If you succeed this mission, you only have to pay half the price.

410
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:35,581
Will you accept the challenge?

411
00:14:35,581 --> 00:14:36,981
- Yes. - Of course.

412
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:39,411
- We don't really have a choice. - That's right.

413
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:43,711
Doesn't it feel like something's missing without Gary?

414
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,981
Not really.

415
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:46,081
To be honest,

416
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:48,281
- this is much better. - There's more food to go around.

417
00:14:48,381 --> 00:14:50,351
Gary eats a lot, too.

418
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:51,781
Gary likes jjajangmyeon.

419
00:14:51,781 --> 00:14:53,211
He does.

420
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:56,581
For the half-price mission,

421
00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:57,751
you'll have to...

422
00:14:57,751 --> 00:14:59,951
(What do they have to do to get a discount on their lunch?)

423
00:14:59,951 --> 00:15:02,211
You'll have to call Gary.

424
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:03,651
("We Want to Hear This")

425
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:06,311
You'll have to call Gary and get him to say something.

426
00:15:06,581 --> 00:15:09,281
(We have to call Gary?)

427
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:17,081
(It's only been a week since we said goodbye to him.)

428
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:21,881
The phrase you have to get out of him is...

429
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:23,951
(What is it?)

430
00:15:23,951 --> 00:15:25,581
- this. - "I want to do the show."

431
00:15:26,951 --> 00:15:28,481
This won't be easy.

432
00:15:28,481 --> 00:15:29,851
The battery's running out.

433
00:15:29,851 --> 00:15:32,611
It already went down by one percent.

434
00:15:32,611 --> 00:15:34,181
- We only have five percent left. - Let's do this.

435
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:36,451
I don't think it's impossible.

436
00:15:36,581 --> 00:15:37,881
We should tell him we have a special guest.

437
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:40,081
- What about Seol Hyun? - Okay.

438
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:42,051
- Ji Hyo could pretend to be her. - Say hello to him.

439
00:15:42,411 --> 00:15:44,051
He'll easily tell it's her.

440
00:15:44,051 --> 00:15:46,911
- He'll know for sure. - Let's try it.

441
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:49,751
We have to come up with a proper plan first.

442
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,611
(30 seconds is the time limit.)

443
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:54,851
He might not pick up since he doesn't know this number.

444
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:56,781
Hello?

445
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:58,211
- Gary. - Gary.

446
00:15:59,011 --> 00:16:00,451
Hello, Gary.

447
00:16:00,451 --> 00:16:02,011
- We have Seol Hyun with us. - Hey, Gary.

448
00:16:02,251 --> 00:16:03,251
Hello.

449
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:04,351
- Hello. - Where are you, Gary?

450
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,851
What are you up to?

451
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:07,611
I'm at my studio.

452
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:09,481
- You are? - Gary.

453
00:16:09,481 --> 00:16:13,181
Seol Hyun came on the show as a special guest today.

454
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,381
I can't believe it.

455
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:16,311
- Are you serious? - Yes.

456
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:18,251
She wants to say hello.

457
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,811
Is Seol Hyun really there?

458
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,751
Hello.

459
00:16:22,751 --> 00:16:23,951
(Hello.)

460
00:16:23,951 --> 00:16:25,111
What was that?

461
00:16:25,111 --> 00:16:26,111
That's Ji Hyo!

462
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,781
(That's Ji Hyo!)

463
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:30,381
I told you he'd know.

464
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:32,251
- Was that the best you could do? - Gosh, Ji Hyo.

465
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:33,411
It sounded nothing like Seol Hyun.

466
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:34,481
You have failed the mission.

467
00:16:34,481 --> 00:16:36,781
We failed the mission.

468
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:38,511
I told you to plan ahead.

469
00:16:39,881 --> 00:16:40,911
I told you.

470
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,451
- We failed? - We needed a plan.

471
00:16:43,451 --> 00:16:44,481
We did have a plan.

472
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:46,011
You call that a plan?

473
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:49,711
- What was that? - "Hello." That was so you.

474
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:51,711
You're not going to fool anyone like that.

475
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,281
You have failed the mission. Would you like to try again?

476
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:55,781
- Yes. - Yes, of course.

477
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,511
If you want to try again,

478
00:16:57,511 --> 00:17:00,381
you have to give us one of your belongings.

479
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:03,211
Take my jacket.

480
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:04,881
- Just one? - Yes.

481
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:06,451
- I'll give you this. - Take Jong Kook's jacket.

482
00:17:06,451 --> 00:17:09,251
We should be upfront with Gary.

483
00:17:09,681 --> 00:17:12,111
- Are we doing the same mission? - I think that'll be for the best.

484
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:13,211
- We should just ask him. - Go like this.

485
00:17:13,381 --> 00:17:14,611
Gary. Listen carefully.

486
00:17:15,011 --> 00:17:17,311
We want you to be on the show.

487
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,211
- How about you? Let's do that. - How about you?

488
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:22,951
- Get the answer out of him. - We're running low on battery.

489
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,381
We should ask him right away as soon as he picks up.

490
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:26,781
- Hello? - Gary.

491
00:17:26,951 --> 00:17:28,881
- Yes? - Sorry we lied about Seol Hyun.

492
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:31,651
We'd like to tell you something.

493
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,181
- We don't have much time. - Ask him.

494
00:17:33,681 --> 00:17:35,851
I want to do the show with you. How about you?

495
00:17:35,851 --> 00:17:38,381
(I want to do the show with you. How about you?)

496
00:17:39,511 --> 00:17:43,011
(Will Gary give them the answer they're looking for?)

497
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:45,081
I want to do the show with you. How about you?

498
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:47,381
(Laughing)

499
00:17:47,381 --> 00:17:49,181
I want to do the show, too.

500
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:53,451
(Half-price mission successful.)

501
00:17:53,511 --> 00:17:54,651
We did it.

502
00:17:54,711 --> 00:17:56,111
- Thanks, Gary. - The phone's dying.

503
00:17:56,111 --> 00:17:57,751
- Hang up. - I have to go, Gary.

504
00:17:57,751 --> 00:18:00,281
- The phone's almost dead. - I'll call you later, Gary.

505
00:18:00,281 --> 00:18:01,651
Just hang up.

506
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:03,421
The phone's running low on battery.

507
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:04,681
- We did it. - Nice.

508
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:06,481
(The 7-year-long friendship proved its worth.)

509
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:08,251
- That's how you do it. - Yes.

510
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:10,811
- He knows what we want. - We can read each other's minds.

511
00:18:10,811 --> 00:18:13,081
- He read our mind. - The lunch bill is...

512
00:18:13,211 --> 00:18:15,481
15 dollars with the discount.

513
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:18,851
- That's a lot of money saved. - Let's order jjajangmyeon.

514
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:22,381
(They got a discount for the food but not for the parking.)

515
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:24,281
- We need three dollars. - For the parking.

516
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:25,981
The parking fee is three dollars.

517
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:28,281
- Three dollars? - Can we get a discount?

518
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:30,481
- It'll be additional three dollars. - Thank you.

519
00:18:30,481 --> 00:18:32,921
- Thank you. - Thank you for the food.

520
00:18:33,381 --> 00:18:34,951
The parking fee got increased.

521
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:39,781
(Apgujeong Tour)

522
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:41,751
(The 2nd course is dessert in a cafe.)

523
00:18:42,311 --> 00:18:44,581
Are we getting dessert now? This is nice.

524
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,011
We're eating again?

525
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:47,711
How much do we have left, Ji Hyo?

526
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:49,311
We have 18 dollars left.

527
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:50,981
- That's quite a lot. - We still have 18 dollars?

528
00:18:50,981 --> 00:18:52,681
There's only 16km left on the gas.

529
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,651
Don't step on the brakes too hard.

530
00:18:56,211 --> 00:18:58,311
- Apply pressure gradually. - This is going to be tight.

531
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:00,211
Can we get two dollars worth of gas?

532
00:19:00,281 --> 00:19:02,151
This sure is a lacking trip.

533
00:19:02,151 --> 00:19:04,581
My stomach isn't even full.

534
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:07,381
Is that the place? We're here.

535
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:09,511
- Jae Seok. - This place changed its name.

536
00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:11,711
The parking is going to cost us all our money.

537
00:19:12,181 --> 00:19:14,421
We shouldn't take the car, then.

538
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:15,451
Someone should stay here.

539
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:17,551
Do you think I enjoy doing this?

540
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,751
- Let's go. - They have delicious desserts.

541
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:22,081
I know this place.

542
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:23,981
- It looks pretty. - It does.

543
00:19:23,981 --> 00:19:26,211
What do you call those things again?

544
00:19:26,481 --> 00:19:28,251
They're called crepe cake.

545
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:30,511
- Crepe cake. - They're famous desserts.

546
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:32,081
- I love crepe cake. - Let's go.

547
00:19:33,051 --> 00:19:34,421
They look delicious.

548
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:38,051
You have to choose between Table A and Table B.

549
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,211
What should we do?

550
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,451
- Let's go with Table A. - We should go with B this time.

551
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:42,011
- B is the good one. - Let's go with A.

552
00:19:42,011 --> 00:19:43,611
- We should go with B. - They're trying to trick us.

553
00:19:43,611 --> 00:19:46,311
- Let's go with Table A. - Let's do that.

554
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,381
(When in doubt, go against Kwang Soo's choice.)

555
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:50,311
I have a good feeling about this.

556
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:51,751
(The members choose Table A by the window.)

557
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:52,881
- This way. - Okay.

558
00:19:53,681 --> 00:19:55,611
Look at this place.

559
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,421
- It still has the same decorations. - It does.

560
00:19:58,421 --> 00:19:59,781
Did it look like this from long ago?

561
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,251
They didn't change anything.

562
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:04,581
- This place looks the same. - How are the two tables different?

563
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:06,211
(This place kept its memories over a long period of time.)

564
00:20:08,481 --> 00:20:12,611
(The dessert menu for Table A is crepe cake and ice Americano.)

565
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:15,181
- Do we sit here? - "Window seats".

566
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:17,951
- We get a crepe cake. - This is good.

567
00:20:17,981 --> 00:20:19,581
- This is good, right? - Two glasses of ice Americano.

568
00:20:19,611 --> 00:20:21,111
- What's the other menu? - Go take a look.

569
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:22,421
What does it say?

570
00:20:22,611 --> 00:20:24,511
This one is ice Americano and ice latte.

571
00:20:24,711 --> 00:20:26,251
This is the better one.

572
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:27,951
- I told you. - This is nice.

573
00:20:27,951 --> 00:20:30,711
- It's a lucky day. - I have a good feeling about today.

574
00:20:30,811 --> 00:20:34,051
- The price of Table A's menu is... - How much is it?

575
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:37,811
- 19 dollars. - What?

576
00:20:37,811 --> 00:20:39,381
Just kill us.

577
00:20:39,921 --> 00:20:41,881
- Haha. - What?

578
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:44,051
Calm down, Haha.

579
00:20:44,051 --> 00:20:46,181
- I lost my temper for a second. - 19 dollars?

580
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,421
Why are we in Apgujeong? We should've gone to Anyang.

581
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:49,951
How much did you say again?

582
00:20:49,951 --> 00:20:51,151
What are you talking about?

583
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:53,921
This is 19 dollars, and we only have 18.

584
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:56,711
You know what? Once you put the desserts in your mouth...

585
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:58,381
- We'll be happy. - We have a soft spot for desserts.

586
00:20:58,781 --> 00:21:00,581
- We're simple like that. - We are.

587
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:04,451
Again, there is a half-price mission.

588
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:05,881
- Before we start, - Give it to us.

589
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:08,281
- let's get the desserts in here. - I'm so hungry.

590
00:21:08,551 --> 00:21:10,051
- Hello. - It looks good.

591
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:12,181
Hello. Thank you.

592
00:21:12,181 --> 00:21:13,581
- Thank you. - Thank you.

593
00:21:13,581 --> 00:21:15,051
It looks so good.

594
00:21:15,051 --> 00:21:16,611
Can we get half of that for half the price?

595
00:21:16,681 --> 00:21:19,581
(The layers of the crepe cake are full of sweet and fruity flavours.)

596
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:22,181
(The americano is full of rich flavours.)

597
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:25,181
(Just by looking, it melts the hearts of the customers.)

598
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:26,581
That's not how you eat it.

599
00:21:26,581 --> 00:21:28,051
You're making us look bad.

600
00:21:28,051 --> 00:21:30,351
I'll show you. Have you never eaten crepe cake?

601
00:21:30,351 --> 00:21:31,921
- That's not how you do it. - That's too much.

602
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:34,581
- Stop it. - That's not how you eat it.

603
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:36,481
Please stop ruining it.

604
00:21:36,481 --> 00:21:38,881
You have to cherish it the way it is.

605
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:41,051
(It's a war of forks.)

606
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,181
Just eat it whole.

607
00:21:42,181 --> 00:21:44,351
- Move your fork. - You eat it like this.

608
00:21:45,381 --> 00:21:46,581
Why'd you take it apart?

609
00:21:46,581 --> 00:21:49,151
There's a reason why they're all stacked up.

610
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:50,851
You only eat one layer at once.

611
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,711
Stop ruining it.

612
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,451
- Just eat it. - Gosh.

613
00:21:54,451 --> 00:21:55,751
- This is how you eat it. - Just eat your dessert.

614
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:57,111
Let's just finish it and get on our way.

615
00:21:58,011 --> 00:21:59,511
I want to go home and rest.

616
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:02,281
Stop nagging me.

617
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:04,181
- I thought you were a travel guide. - Just buy another one to-go.

618
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:05,351
I've had enough of you.

619
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:06,811
(Jae Seok never had worse tourists.)

620
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:08,251
It's already gone.

621
00:22:09,111 --> 00:22:10,381
- That was quick. - It's so good.

622
00:22:10,911 --> 00:22:13,251
Hey. Put it down.

623
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:16,681
(Licking like a giraffe)

624
00:22:16,681 --> 00:22:17,681
Seok Jin.

625
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:20,851
We have to share this.

626
00:22:20,851 --> 00:22:22,951
- Don't hog the coffee. - You should respect the elderly.

627
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:24,811
I'm really thirsty.

628
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:26,851
This is sad.

629
00:22:26,851 --> 00:22:28,011
(I'm the oldest one here in case you've forgotten.)

630
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:29,451
It's so good.

631
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:31,781
I wish I could have just one more bite.

632
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:34,311
(Quiet)

633
00:22:35,011 --> 00:22:36,311
(He wants to say something.)

634
00:22:37,011 --> 00:22:38,051
It's too strong.

635
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:39,711
(The cream tastes better when it's melted.)

636
00:22:40,311 --> 00:22:43,651
Seok Jin just ate from the plate Kwang Soo licked on.

637
00:22:43,651 --> 00:22:45,951
He was just licking on the plate.

638
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:47,251
Did you not know?

639
00:22:47,251 --> 00:22:50,381
- I forgot about that. - He forgot about Kwang Soo.

640
00:22:50,381 --> 00:22:52,581
He just ate from what Kwang Soo was licking on.

641
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:54,651
I know we're family and all, but...

642
00:22:54,881 --> 00:22:56,451
Even my mum doesn't do that.

643
00:22:56,451 --> 00:22:58,181
(Is that why it was melted?)

644
00:22:58,181 --> 00:23:01,181
This is a fancy place. How did you afford it back then?

645
00:23:01,711 --> 00:23:03,051
(He's flustered.)

646
00:23:03,051 --> 00:23:04,481
We only ordered one.

647
00:23:04,681 --> 00:23:07,111
He's so pretentious.

648
00:23:07,311 --> 00:23:08,911
- Why did you used to come here? - This reminds me of the old days.

649
00:23:08,911 --> 00:23:11,211
I wasn't well off, but when I came here,

650
00:23:11,951 --> 00:23:13,811
I ordered two pieces of cake for take-out.

651
00:23:14,651 --> 00:23:15,851
- You took them home? - Yes.

652
00:23:16,111 --> 00:23:17,481
I'd take them home...

653
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,081
and finish them by myself.

654
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:21,151
(I ate them by myself.)

655
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,211
By yourself?

656
00:23:22,211 --> 00:23:23,781
You didn't share with anyone?

657
00:23:23,781 --> 00:23:25,881
My parents didn't like creamy food.

658
00:23:26,851 --> 00:23:29,551
- They don't eat this kind of food. - So you ate them by yourself?

659
00:23:29,551 --> 00:23:30,651
That's right.

660
00:23:30,651 --> 00:23:32,851
You bought two pieces of cake just to enjoy them by yourself?

661
00:23:32,851 --> 00:23:34,411
- You came all the way out here? - It's a long way from home.

662
00:23:34,411 --> 00:23:36,111
You went through all the trouble to come out here?

663
00:23:36,111 --> 00:23:37,781
- You came all the way from Suyuri? - That's right.

664
00:23:37,881 --> 00:23:40,781
I didn't live in Gangnam back then.

665
00:23:40,781 --> 00:23:42,311
I remember an episode from the old days.

666
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:46,251
We were at a cafe in Apgujeong, and he asked me to lend him my car.

667
00:23:46,251 --> 00:23:47,281
Why all of a sudden?

668
00:23:47,281 --> 00:23:48,711
He came back after a while.

669
00:23:49,211 --> 00:23:52,011
I had to change the engine the day after.

670
00:23:52,211 --> 00:23:53,551
- Why? - The thing is...

671
00:23:53,551 --> 00:23:55,811
- It was an old car. - My car was really old.

672
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:57,111
You weren't supposed to go over 50km per hour.

673
00:23:57,481 --> 00:24:00,611
- That's ridiculous. - He went over 70km per hour.

674
00:24:00,611 --> 00:24:02,911
- That destroyed the engine? - I told him.

675
00:24:02,981 --> 00:24:06,081
Jae Seok. I'll lend you the car, but you shouldn't go over 50km per hour.

676
00:24:06,151 --> 00:24:07,481
You can't call something like that a car.

677
00:24:07,651 --> 00:24:09,281
- It was such an old car. - That's a sad story.

678
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,011
It was a really old car.

679
00:24:11,011 --> 00:24:13,311
When he bought the used car,

680
00:24:13,311 --> 00:24:16,281
it was already on the verge of getting scrapped.

681
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:19,381
I was almost broke, but I had to get a new engine.

682
00:24:19,381 --> 00:24:20,751
- You did that? - On a used car.

683
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,081
You were just unlucky.

684
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:23,711
What are you talking about?

685
00:24:24,011 --> 00:24:25,811
- You were speeding. - I wasn't.

686
00:24:26,851 --> 00:24:29,311
Do you feel like you're missing something?

687
00:24:29,311 --> 00:24:30,411
- Yes. - Yes.

688
00:24:30,611 --> 00:24:32,411
It's such a tight budget.

689
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:36,051
A piece of cake is too small to share with six people.

690
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:37,051
- We may fight over it. - And...

691
00:24:37,051 --> 00:24:41,081
the van will stop soon. It can run only about 10km.

692
00:24:41,251 --> 00:24:43,581
I see. You mean we must be missing Gary because there are only six.

693
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:45,651
I forgot him again.

694
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,651
It's good to be without him when eating.

695
00:24:47,651 --> 00:24:49,751
For the chance for half price, you'll do the same.

696
00:24:49,751 --> 00:24:51,811
- Call Gary. - Again?

697
00:24:51,811 --> 00:24:54,181
We said goodbye to Gary last week.

698
00:24:54,181 --> 00:24:55,751
I even cried.

699
00:24:55,751 --> 00:24:57,651
She cried.

700
00:24:57,651 --> 00:25:00,451
Kwang Soo also cried after the shooting.

701
00:25:00,451 --> 00:25:02,011
I don't understand why you cried and made a scene.

702
00:25:02,011 --> 00:25:03,351
He cried that night.

703
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:05,051
- Why? - He cried alone a lot.

704
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:06,611
He wailed.

705
00:25:06,611 --> 00:25:08,481
Why did you?

706
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:10,351
When it became dark...

707
00:25:10,351 --> 00:25:13,451
I sent Kwang Soo a photo of all of us...

708
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:16,481
and he sent me a photo of himself crying.

709
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:19,651
- What are you doing? - Are you showing off?

710
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,281
You're just showing off. It's not because you're sad.

711
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:23,581
You broke up with a girl, didn't you?

712
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:25,811
Why do you bring that up suddenly?

713
00:25:26,011 --> 00:25:28,351
Call Gary this time...

714
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:31,111
and pass the speed quiz.

715
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:35,181
You should get 6 answers in 60 seconds to pass.

716
00:25:35,351 --> 00:25:36,611
It's about capitals.

717
00:25:36,611 --> 00:25:39,351
We can say Seoul is "this" of Korea.

718
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:40,951
No. He should answer the capitals of the countries.

719
00:25:40,951 --> 00:25:42,951
"Capitals" is the subject.

720
00:25:43,081 --> 00:25:45,611
- Is it the subject? - What was he thinking?

721
00:25:46,181 --> 00:25:49,481
- Subjects like animals or capitals. - Wasn't it the first question?

722
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,451
(He's now too old to understand the rule at one try.)

723
00:25:51,451 --> 00:25:53,211
What are you talking about?

724
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:56,911
- Gary! - Gary!

725
00:25:56,911 --> 00:25:59,281
- It's a quiz about capitals. - A speed quiz.

726
00:25:59,451 --> 00:26:00,481
What's the capital of Germany?

727
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:02,981
Pardon? Please say one more time.

728
00:26:02,981 --> 00:26:04,111
What's the capital of Germany?

729
00:26:04,651 --> 00:26:06,151
- The capital of Germany? - Yes.

730
00:26:06,751 --> 00:26:08,281
- Berlin? - Correct.

731
00:26:08,381 --> 00:26:09,651
What's the capital of Kenya?

732
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,651
(It's a difficult one.)

733
00:26:10,651 --> 00:26:12,181
What's the capital of Kenya?

734
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:14,281
Isn't it Kenya?

735
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,481
- No. - No.

736
00:26:15,481 --> 00:26:17,981
That city reminds me of an old man in a lobby in Korean.

737
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,281
Bragging?

738
00:26:20,281 --> 00:26:21,481
(It's a creative yet wrong answer.)

739
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:23,351
It's not Niagara.

740
00:26:23,351 --> 00:26:24,751
An old man in a lobby.

741
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,711
(It's a childish hint.)

742
00:26:27,381 --> 00:26:28,451
It has three syllables.

743
00:26:28,551 --> 00:26:30,351
- Naironi. - No, it's not.

744
00:26:31,081 --> 00:26:33,081
- A lobby. - I said a lobby.

745
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:35,611
- Oh, Nairobi. - That's correct.

746
00:26:35,651 --> 00:26:36,651
What's the capital of Egypt?

747
00:26:37,651 --> 00:26:38,751
- The capital of Egypt? - Yes.

748
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:40,181
It's over.

749
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,951
I don't know what it is.

750
00:26:41,951 --> 00:26:43,181
- Think of the Blue Marble game. - He doesn't know.

751
00:26:43,481 --> 00:26:45,151
- Think of Kai of EXO. - Kai.

752
00:26:45,851 --> 00:26:47,711
- Kai? - It sounds like "Let's go to Kai."

753
00:26:47,711 --> 00:26:49,081
(The hints are ridiculous.)

754
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:52,581
Your challenge failed.

755
00:26:52,751 --> 00:26:54,651
- You failed. - Gosh, Gary.

756
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:56,351
- It's too difficult for Gary. - Too difficult.

757
00:26:56,351 --> 00:26:57,911
- It's hard. - Sorry, Gary. We have to go.

758
00:26:57,911 --> 00:26:59,281
Gary, I'm sorry. We're running out of battery.

759
00:26:59,281 --> 00:27:01,281
Pick up the phone quickly.

760
00:27:01,281 --> 00:27:02,811
This is driving me crazy.

761
00:27:02,811 --> 00:27:03,981
We'll try again.

762
00:27:03,981 --> 00:27:05,251
Only three percent of the battery is left.

763
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:07,381
Frankly, it's too hard for him.

764
00:27:07,381 --> 00:27:09,281
- It was too difficult. - It sure was.

765
00:27:09,281 --> 00:27:11,581
- We've seen Gary for a long time. - Let Seok Jin answer this.

766
00:27:11,751 --> 00:27:13,211
(The phone rings.)

767
00:27:13,781 --> 00:27:15,711
- It's Gary. - Why did he call?

768
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,611
- We don't have enough battery. - Gary, we don't have battery.

769
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:18,611
What is it, Gary?

770
00:27:18,611 --> 00:27:20,651
What are you guys doing?

771
00:27:20,651 --> 00:27:21,651
Sorry.

772
00:27:21,651 --> 00:27:23,751
- Gary. - Just do as we tell you to.

773
00:27:23,751 --> 00:27:26,751
Pick up the phone quickly. You're not busy on Mondays.

774
00:27:27,651 --> 00:27:30,251
- Gary. - Hang up. We're running out.

775
00:27:30,251 --> 00:27:33,651
I think you want to join the shooting, don't you?

776
00:27:34,711 --> 00:27:36,451
Since you called us back.

777
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:38,281
- You want to, right? - I'm curious.

778
00:27:38,351 --> 00:27:39,581
- You must be. - He says he's curious.

779
00:27:39,711 --> 00:27:42,081
We can't talk for long but I'll call again.

780
00:27:42,081 --> 00:27:43,811
Answer your phone quickly.

781
00:27:43,811 --> 00:27:44,811
Bye.

782
00:27:45,381 --> 00:27:47,051
If you give me an item, I'll give you another chance.

783
00:27:47,051 --> 00:27:49,651
- What should we give him? - A coat.

784
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:51,251
Give him mine.

785
00:27:51,251 --> 00:27:52,281
(An item gives you another chance.)

786
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:54,311
We don't have anything to give other than that.

787
00:27:54,311 --> 00:27:55,351
It's the second chance.

788
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:56,451
(Second challenge starts.)

789
00:27:56,451 --> 00:27:57,911
- Hello. - It's food.

790
00:27:57,911 --> 00:27:59,181
- It's difficult. - Gary.

791
00:27:59,351 --> 00:28:02,381
- It's pasta made with garlic. - With oil.

792
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:05,081
- How does he know? - It's a type of oil pasta.

793
00:28:05,611 --> 00:28:06,751
It's made with garlic.

794
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:07,851
- You know this. - Four syllables.

795
00:28:07,851 --> 00:28:08,851
Made with oil.

796
00:28:08,951 --> 00:28:10,381
- What? - Goodness.

797
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:11,651
Something Lee Sun Kyun makes.

798
00:28:11,651 --> 00:28:13,911
- He only eats Korean noodles. - Lee Sun Kyun?

799
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:16,981
Gary, it sounds like Ali.

800
00:28:16,981 --> 00:28:19,751
- Aglio olio. - It sounds like Ali or oli.

801
00:28:19,751 --> 00:28:21,351
Aglio olio.

802
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:22,911
Is it aglio olio?

803
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:24,111
- Yes, aglio olio. - Is it correct?

804
00:28:24,981 --> 00:28:26,711
These foods are too difficult.

805
00:28:26,711 --> 00:28:28,881
It's salad made of two words.

806
00:28:29,481 --> 00:28:31,081
- Two words? - Named after the emperor of Rome.

807
00:28:31,081 --> 00:28:33,051
The salad the emperor of Rome liked.

808
00:28:33,351 --> 00:28:35,451
The salad the emperor of Rome liked?

809
00:28:35,551 --> 00:28:38,511
The pronunciation is similar to "I hate it" in Korean.

810
00:28:39,081 --> 00:28:41,051
- Caesar? - Right. Okay.

811
00:28:42,151 --> 00:28:43,751
- This is crazy. - I don't feel like doing it.

812
00:28:43,751 --> 00:28:45,551
I've never heard of this kind of pizza.

813
00:28:45,651 --> 00:28:47,011
I've never heard of margherita pizza.

814
00:28:47,011 --> 00:28:48,551
- What is this? - Margherita?

815
00:28:48,551 --> 00:28:50,051
Gary, we have to cancel this.

816
00:28:52,151 --> 00:28:54,551
This is too hard. How could he know margherita pizza?

817
00:28:54,551 --> 00:28:57,311
- Try to explain it. - And there's not much Gary knows.

818
00:28:57,451 --> 00:28:59,951
- This is difficult to answer. - How does he know aglio olio?

819
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:01,251
What's wrong with aglio olio?

820
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:03,451
Just give him another coat.

821
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:04,551
(Haha gives his coat.)

822
00:29:04,551 --> 00:29:05,851
Seok Jin never gives up his.

823
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:07,451
I'm cold.

824
00:29:08,681 --> 00:29:10,751
(It's the third challenge.)

825
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:14,651
What's the Korean noodles you eat at a party?

826
00:29:14,751 --> 00:29:16,811
- Janchi guksu? - No, no.

827
00:29:16,811 --> 00:29:19,351
- You're not doing it right. - Come on.

828
00:29:19,351 --> 00:29:22,081
It's food made with glass noodles.

829
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:23,611
- Oh, japchae. - Correct.

830
00:29:23,711 --> 00:29:25,751
What's cream pasta with bacon?

831
00:29:25,751 --> 00:29:29,181
The name sounds like laughter.

832
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:30,751
- Carbonara? - That's right.

833
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:32,811
This is something I really like.

834
00:29:32,811 --> 00:29:34,451
- It's kimchi made with cucumbers. - It's made with cucumbers.

835
00:29:35,951 --> 00:29:37,151
Pickled cucumbers?

836
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:38,911
No. It's kimchi.

837
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:40,581
(The hints are too obvious.)

838
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:41,811
It's kimchi.

839
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,981
- Cucumber kimchi. - That's right.

840
00:29:44,111 --> 00:29:46,481
What's japchae made with chilli peppers?

841
00:29:47,011 --> 00:29:48,381
- Chilli pepper japchae. - Correct.

842
00:29:49,011 --> 00:29:52,151
- Explain well. - What's gimbap from Chungmu?

843
00:29:52,351 --> 00:29:54,251
Gimbap you eat in Chungmu.

844
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:56,611
- Chungmu gimbap. - There you go.

845
00:29:56,651 --> 00:29:59,011
What's the traditional cookie you like?

846
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:02,111
The pronunciation itself sounds like "weak cookies".

847
00:30:02,211 --> 00:30:04,311
- Not strong but weak cookies. - It's yakgwa.

848
00:30:04,881 --> 00:30:06,451
- Yakgwa is right. - Okay.

849
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:08,851
What's something similar to sujeonggwa?

850
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:09,851
Birak is the famous brand for this.

851
00:30:09,951 --> 00:30:11,411
- Sikhye. - Okay.

852
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,151
- Time's up. - We made it.

853
00:30:13,151 --> 00:30:14,751
The mission is cleared.

854
00:30:14,751 --> 00:30:16,111
(They can pay only half.)

855
00:30:16,111 --> 00:30:18,281
- I liked your explanation. - Thank you.

856
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:20,211
(Kwang Soo's explanation was the best.)

857
00:30:20,211 --> 00:30:24,111
Since you cleared the mission, you can pay only half of 19 dollars.

858
00:30:24,111 --> 00:30:25,151
It's 8 dollars and 50 cents, then.

859
00:30:25,251 --> 00:30:26,951
No, it's 9 dollars and 50 cents.

860
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:28,451
(Math isn't his strong point.)

861
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,651
Math has...

862
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:31,751
Seok Jin, just go home.

863
00:30:32,011 --> 00:30:34,711
- Drink something and go home. - Math has changed a lot.

864
00:30:34,711 --> 00:30:38,011
If we spend almost 10 dollars and pay for valet parking...

865
00:30:38,111 --> 00:30:39,551
We need to fill our van with gas, too.

866
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:43,251
Could you give us an extra hour to earn some money?

867
00:30:43,611 --> 00:30:45,981
We're extremely short of money.

868
00:30:45,981 --> 00:30:47,081
This is too harsh.

869
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:48,451
We should sell our autographs.

870
00:30:48,451 --> 00:30:50,481
It's not just lack of money. We're in poverty.

871
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:51,911
I don't think it is appropriate but...

872
00:30:51,911 --> 00:30:53,381
can't you just take some money from them?

873
00:30:53,381 --> 00:30:54,711
(Go back to your old self.)

874
00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:56,011
I know it's not appropriate but...

875
00:30:56,051 --> 00:30:59,211
For now, we can go to the next destination with the gas.

876
00:30:59,211 --> 00:31:00,351
(I have an idea.)

877
00:31:00,351 --> 00:31:01,711
I know an inexpensive gas station.

878
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:03,981
It is difficult to drive to the gas station.

879
00:31:03,981 --> 00:31:04,981
(We all know those kinds of stations.)

880
00:31:04,981 --> 00:31:06,251
There are a lot in our neighbourhood.

881
00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:08,451
There is one near Ilsan that is far away from here.

882
00:31:08,811 --> 00:31:10,911
- I know one, too. - There is one near Jayuro.

883
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,081
There must be one near Jayuro.

884
00:31:12,081 --> 00:31:14,051
The gas price in Cheongju is really low.

885
00:31:14,911 --> 00:31:16,751
Do you think they'll give us?

886
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:18,611
(They leave for the third destination.)

887
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:19,711
How much is it for valet parking?

888
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,451
- It's 3 dollars. - Why is valet parking so expensive?

889
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:23,851
- It's so expensive. - I can't believe it's 3 dollars.

890
00:31:23,851 --> 00:31:24,981
(They have 5 dollars and 68 cents.)

891
00:31:24,981 --> 00:31:26,811
If we're out of gas, we'll leave this van behind.

892
00:31:26,811 --> 00:31:28,851
We only have 5 dollars.

893
00:31:28,851 --> 00:31:30,811
It's not fair for us to pay for valet parking.

894
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:33,351
- Give the money for valet parking. - Right.

895
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:35,211
I feel nervous without money.

896
00:31:35,211 --> 00:31:36,211
(They head for karaoke.)

897
00:31:37,781 --> 00:31:39,111
We can go 10km more.

898
00:31:39,111 --> 00:31:41,181
(The gas gauge makes them nervous.)

899
00:31:41,181 --> 00:31:42,551
- I feel uneasy. - How about asking Gary...

900
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:44,581
to use this van for a while?

901
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,281
- We're short of gas. - Let him fill this up.

902
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:48,611
We did all give him gifts last week.

903
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:50,051
(Gary should pay us back.)

904
00:31:51,251 --> 00:31:52,281
I thought Gary had prepared something, too.

905
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:53,651
You're supposed to park your car in a parking lot.

906
00:31:53,651 --> 00:31:55,111
- Is there a parking lot? - Yes.

907
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:56,981
We don't need valet parking service.

908
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:59,651
What are you talking about? We need to pay a parking fee, too.

909
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:02,751
It can be free if we use the karaoke.

910
00:32:02,751 --> 00:32:04,451
- Free? - That's possible.

911
00:32:04,451 --> 00:32:06,481
It would be free if they validated parking.

912
00:32:06,611 --> 00:32:08,081
That sounds possible.

913
00:32:08,081 --> 00:32:09,851
(They need to save every dollar.)

914
00:32:09,851 --> 00:32:11,111
Do they validate parking?

915
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:13,281
- Is it free if we get it stamped? - Yes, for an hour.

916
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:15,211
- An hour? - Okay. Thank you.

917
00:32:15,211 --> 00:32:17,111
- Hello. - Hello.

918
00:32:17,781 --> 00:32:19,551
This is the third destination.

919
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:21,751
We're at a karaoke.

920
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:25,211
This mission is called "Score 1,000".

921
00:32:25,211 --> 00:32:26,211
("Score 1,000")

922
00:32:26,481 --> 00:32:29,511
To move to the next destination, you have to gather 1,000 points.

923
00:32:29,911 --> 00:32:33,211
You can use Sing to Gary Cards here.

924
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,251
- What is it? - What is that?

925
00:32:34,251 --> 00:32:36,251
While other members are singing,

926
00:32:36,281 --> 00:32:39,151
each of you will go see Gary...

927
00:32:39,151 --> 00:32:41,251
and do the Sing Along Relay.

928
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:42,811
We'll give each of you two dollars if you succeed.

929
00:32:42,811 --> 00:32:45,151
(They'll get 2 dollars every time they succeed.)

930
00:32:45,551 --> 00:32:47,981
Then we can earn up to 12 dollars.

931
00:32:47,981 --> 00:32:50,081
We should locate Gary first.

932
00:32:50,081 --> 00:32:52,151
Hand me the phone.

933
00:32:52,711 --> 00:32:53,751
I'll call Gary.

934
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:56,011
(It is critical to find out Gary's location.)

935
00:32:56,281 --> 00:32:59,181
Gary, this is Seok Jin. Where are you now?

936
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:00,811
At your workroom?

937
00:33:01,111 --> 00:33:05,651
- At his studio? - I see. I just wanted to know.

938
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:08,481
(He is so obvious again.)

939
00:33:08,911 --> 00:33:09,951
I'll go.

940
00:33:10,711 --> 00:33:13,051
- Hurry up. - Come back in a hurry.

941
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:14,381
(He goes to see Gary.)

942
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:16,351
If you eat something, we'll notice right away.

943
00:33:16,351 --> 00:33:17,811
- All right. - Please don't.

944
00:33:18,611 --> 00:33:19,911
Is this the way out?

945
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:22,551
(The time assigned at the karaoke is 30 minutes. He should hurry.)

946
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:24,451
- Where are the microphones? - Where are they?

947
00:33:24,451 --> 00:33:25,711
(The mission begins.)

948
00:33:26,011 --> 00:33:27,151
Here are the microphones.

949
00:33:27,211 --> 00:33:28,251
What is "Fear"?

950
00:33:28,451 --> 00:33:29,811
It's a song by Mino.

951
00:33:29,811 --> 00:33:34,381
(They choose "Fear" without fear.)

952
00:33:34,381 --> 00:33:36,981
(His voice is too low.)

953
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,611
I think you're out of tune.

954
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,181
I think it's off key.

955
00:33:41,011 --> 00:33:43,211
(Jae Seok is worse than Haha.)

956
00:33:43,751 --> 00:33:45,351
(He raps with the groove.)

957
00:33:46,981 --> 00:33:49,451
I bet he thinks he's doing well.

958
00:33:49,451 --> 00:33:51,711
(We didn't know...)

959
00:33:51,711 --> 00:33:53,981
(that we had hip hop running through our veins.)

960
00:33:55,011 --> 00:33:56,911
(They're copying everything they can.)

961
00:33:57,811 --> 00:34:00,851
(Tae Yang's part is approaching.)

962
00:34:00,851 --> 00:34:02,711
(I am a Tae Yang of Running Man.)

963
00:34:03,551 --> 00:34:06,111
(They missed their cue.)

964
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:09,851
(Look at these two.)

965
00:34:10,651 --> 00:34:13,911
(The two guys in their 40s are attacking us with hip hop.)

966
00:34:14,821 --> 00:34:18,011
(Their singing makes others full of fear.)

967
00:34:18,011 --> 00:34:21,051
(But they seem to be very satisfied with themselves.)

968
00:34:22,081 --> 00:34:25,251
(They're hurting our eyes and ears.)

969
00:34:26,381 --> 00:34:27,381
(He screams.)

970
00:34:28,111 --> 00:34:29,911
(The 4 minutes felt like 40 minutes.)

971
00:34:29,911 --> 00:34:31,481
What are you guys doing?

972
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,981
- The score is 86. - We sang so well.

973
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:35,781
It's a high score.

974
00:34:35,781 --> 00:34:38,321
You should start singing the next song already.

975
00:34:38,321 --> 00:34:39,321
Hurry up.

976
00:34:39,351 --> 00:34:42,551
(Seok Jin finally arrives at Gary's studio.)

977
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:44,081
I'm sorry, Gary.

978
00:34:44,551 --> 00:34:45,821
You quit Running Man,

979
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,981
but that doesn't mean we allowed you to quit.

980
00:34:49,411 --> 00:34:52,651
You're still in our hearts.

981
00:34:53,851 --> 00:34:54,981
Where's the doorbell?

982
00:34:54,981 --> 00:34:58,821
(Will he meet Gary and accomplish the mission?)

983
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:00,181
(Gary's friend, DJ Panda)

984
00:35:00,251 --> 00:35:02,321
- Hello. - Gary.

985
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:06,781
(He hasn't seen Gary for a week and missed calling his name.)

986
00:35:06,781 --> 00:35:09,781
I'm sorry, Gary. I'm sorry.

987
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:12,181
Gary, you're on Running Man.

988
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:15,081
Today is Monday. We have to shoot Running Man.

989
00:35:15,111 --> 00:35:16,181
- Why are you still here? - You startled me.

990
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:17,481
- You startled me. - Why are you still here?

991
00:35:17,581 --> 00:35:20,511
Today is Monday. Let's go shoot.

992
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:23,081
Wait a minute. This is so hectic.

993
00:35:23,411 --> 00:35:25,011
- What's going on? - It might be over for Gary,

994
00:35:25,011 --> 00:35:26,981
but it's not over for us yet.

995
00:35:26,981 --> 00:35:29,481
Gary is always in our hearts on Mondays. Let's go.

996
00:35:29,481 --> 00:35:31,711
I quit Running Man last week.

997
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:33,981
- Why are you here? - I know you quit.

998
00:35:33,981 --> 00:35:36,451
We don't have much time, so please help us.

999
00:35:36,451 --> 00:35:38,781
- What's going on? - Listen.

1000
00:35:38,981 --> 00:35:41,011
Ring, ring, ring, ring

1001
00:35:41,081 --> 00:35:44,711
(You've been on Running Man long enough. What's the answer?)

1002
00:35:44,711 --> 00:35:46,651
Ring, ring, ring, ring

1003
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:48,411
Shrug, shrug

1004
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:49,981
Shrug, shrug

1005
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,881
All right, we got it, right?

1006
00:35:51,881 --> 00:35:53,551
(Seok Jin succeeds.)

1007
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,081
- Was that it? - They will keep coming.

1008
00:35:56,081 --> 00:35:57,381
- Here? - Yes.

1009
00:35:57,381 --> 00:35:59,651
- Gary. - Please let me work.

1010
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:02,351
Gary, Running Man may be over for you,

1011
00:36:02,351 --> 00:36:04,481
but you're still with us in our hearts.

1012
00:36:04,511 --> 00:36:06,551
- Gary. - It's good to see you but...

1013
00:36:06,551 --> 00:36:08,351
- I'll be back every week. - It isn't awkward, though.

1014
00:36:08,351 --> 00:36:10,411
Right? Ring, ring, ring, ring

1015
00:36:10,411 --> 00:36:13,321
Shrug, shrug

1016
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:14,411
Okay!

1017
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,821
Thanks to you, I earned two dollars.

1018
00:36:16,821 --> 00:36:18,381
Did we succeed?

1019
00:36:18,381 --> 00:36:19,981
- Yes, we did. Thank you. - Where are you headed?

1020
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:21,981
- I don't have time right now. - Are all of you nearby?

1021
00:36:21,981 --> 00:36:23,011
- Yes. - Really?

1022
00:36:23,011 --> 00:36:25,381
We keep wandering around your area.

1023
00:36:25,381 --> 00:36:26,611
We keep wandering around.

1024
00:36:26,611 --> 00:36:29,611
You keep calling me, so I can't have my meeting.

1025
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:32,181
I know you quit, but we think you're still with us.

1026
00:36:32,351 --> 00:36:34,481
- Keep that in mind. - Goodness.

1027
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:38,211
(They're engrossed in singing that they don't care about Gary.)

1028
00:36:38,211 --> 00:36:39,581
Keep falling

1029
00:36:39,581 --> 00:36:41,351
(Excited)

1030
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:45,181
(Unfortunately, they don't have enough swag to sing the song.)

1031
00:36:45,181 --> 00:36:49,011
(Do you know hip hop?)

1032
00:36:49,011 --> 00:36:50,321
You feel pain

1033
00:36:50,321 --> 00:36:52,821
(The others who watch them feel embarrassed for them.)

1034
00:36:53,081 --> 00:36:55,081
(Jong Kook joins the group.)

1035
00:36:55,081 --> 00:36:57,651
(The singing gets more exciting.)

1036
00:36:58,081 --> 00:37:01,651
(Kwang Soo ruins the mood.)

1037
00:37:01,651 --> 00:37:03,381
(Let it be a high score.)

1038
00:37:03,381 --> 00:37:04,511
What's the score?

1039
00:37:04,881 --> 00:37:06,451
(The score is 98.)

1040
00:37:06,451 --> 00:37:08,981
- We're so good. - We're almost there.

1041
00:37:08,981 --> 00:37:10,381
This is a great place.

1042
00:37:10,451 --> 00:37:13,011
- Where is Seok Jin? - This karaoke gives high scores.

1043
00:37:13,081 --> 00:37:15,581
- What's "Footsteps"? - That's Kwang Soo's favourite.

1044
00:37:15,681 --> 00:37:17,451
What kind of song is this?

1045
00:37:17,451 --> 00:37:19,111
This is Kwang Soo's favourite song.

1046
00:37:19,451 --> 00:37:20,851
- What are you doing? - Kwang Soo.

1047
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:23,321
He always sings this when he's in love with someone.

1048
00:37:23,321 --> 00:37:24,611
It's "Footsteps".

1049
00:37:24,611 --> 00:37:26,181
(He dedicates this song to her.)

1050
00:37:26,181 --> 00:37:27,911
I wonder who she is.

1051
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:32,751
(As the sun sets, the footsteps lead me)

1052
00:37:33,781 --> 00:37:34,981
(He's completely absorbed.)

1053
00:37:34,981 --> 00:37:36,181
This song is...

1054
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:39,181
one of the top five men's favourite songs.

1055
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:40,451
It's a song by Emerald Castle.

1056
00:37:41,711 --> 00:37:44,011
I wonder if I still have

1057
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:49,911
(For now, forget about the Kwang Soo we know.)

1058
00:37:49,911 --> 00:37:54,651
(At this moment, he's a real man.)

1059
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,381
The time

1060
00:37:56,381 --> 00:37:58,181
- Press 503. - This song?

1061
00:37:58,181 --> 00:38:00,211
(The others aren't listening to his singing.)

1062
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,681
I'll sing "Last Love" next.

1063
00:38:01,911 --> 00:38:03,451
I believed

1064
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:06,511
Even that was

1065
00:38:06,511 --> 00:38:07,981
Seok Jin is back.

1066
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,181
You're up next, Haha. I made it.

1067
00:38:11,181 --> 00:38:13,081
- Haha, you should go now. - Who's up next?

1068
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:14,821
- Go, Haha. - What did you bring?

1069
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:17,011
Gary gave it to me. Can't we eat it?

1070
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:19,911
- Gary gave it to me. - Go, Haha.

1071
00:38:19,911 --> 00:38:23,551
(Kwang Soo's song reaches its climax.)

1072
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,651
From the beginning

1073
00:38:26,651 --> 00:38:29,851
(Kwang Soo wanted to sing the refrain.)

1074
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:33,111
No! No!

1075
00:38:33,181 --> 00:38:34,451
(Laughing)

1076
00:38:34,451 --> 00:38:35,481
Please!

1077
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:37,611
(The tour guide, Jae Seok, does all the main parts.)

1078
00:38:37,851 --> 00:38:40,181
Didn't we shoot Running Man here before?

1079
00:38:42,481 --> 00:38:44,181
(Knocking)

1080
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:46,351
Who is it?

1081
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:51,251
Goodness, please stop coming.

1082
00:38:52,321 --> 00:38:54,581
- Hello. - Why did you lose so much weight?

1083
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:55,611
Did I?

1084
00:38:56,351 --> 00:38:57,381
- Gary. - What?

1085
00:38:57,381 --> 00:39:00,081
I told you last week that I wanted to see how you were doing.

1086
00:39:00,081 --> 00:39:01,881
- We also talked two days ago. - Since I cried...

1087
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,181
and said farewell, shouldn't it be over?

1088
00:39:05,211 --> 00:39:07,751
It goes up and down, then repeat

1089
00:39:07,751 --> 00:39:11,321
(The answer is "Joy and sorrow repeat".)

1090
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:13,681
Joy and sorrow repeat

1091
00:39:13,681 --> 00:39:15,911
Joy and sorrow repeat

1092
00:39:15,911 --> 00:39:18,351
- Bye. - Are you leaving already?

1093
00:39:18,411 --> 00:39:20,581
Have a drink before you go.

1094
00:39:20,581 --> 00:39:22,781
I have to go back to the other members.

1095
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:25,111
- You'll just leave? - You're still on the show,

1096
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:28,181
so don't move out of the studio without our permission.

1097
00:39:28,181 --> 00:39:29,851
- We still need you. - Okay.

1098
00:39:29,851 --> 00:39:31,781
- I'm leaving now. - See you.

1099
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:36,281
(At the karaoke, the members are singing terribly.)

1100
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:40,451
(He exaggerates his movements while singing the high note.)

1101
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:43,751
(Kwang Soo, please stop singing.)

1102
00:39:44,581 --> 00:39:47,181
(Jae Seok reserves the next song to save time.)

1103
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:51,081
(He pretends to look good.)

1104
00:39:51,081 --> 00:39:52,551
We have 11 minutes left. What's next?

1105
00:39:52,551 --> 00:39:54,111
- How much time do we have? - It's 93.

1106
00:39:54,111 --> 00:39:56,251
- That's amazing. - We must hurry.

1107
00:39:56,651 --> 00:39:59,381
Jae Seok, Gary's studio is farther than you think.

1108
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:00,751
You must go now.

1109
00:40:00,751 --> 00:40:03,351
You don't have time to say hello. I started the mission right away.

1110
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,581
- Go now. Hurry. - Jae Seok, you should sing.

1111
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:06,851
Okay.

1112
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:09,851
Don't say hello. Just start as soon as you get there.

1113
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:12,911
Gosh, I wanted to sing the next song.

1114
00:40:13,551 --> 00:40:15,321
I must choose a song that Gary would know.

1115
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:16,711
(He'll sing a song that Gary knows.)

1116
00:40:16,711 --> 00:40:18,711
I don't have time. Gary.

1117
00:40:19,321 --> 00:40:22,321
The song goes... Oh, hello. Gary.

1118
00:40:23,011 --> 00:40:25,081
You seem so compassionate

1119
00:40:25,081 --> 00:40:26,981
(The answer is, "So I like you".)

1120
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:28,981
So I... What did you say?

1121
00:40:28,981 --> 00:40:30,881
So I... What did you say?

1122
00:40:31,281 --> 00:40:32,611
Come on, Gary.

1123
00:40:33,281 --> 00:40:36,251
- You seem so compassionate - So I

1124
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,981
Hold on, it's your song, "Your Scent".

1125
00:40:39,321 --> 00:40:41,481
Don't you know your own song, "Your Scent"?

1126
00:40:43,081 --> 00:40:44,911
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

1127
00:40:45,081 --> 00:40:47,751
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

1128
00:40:47,751 --> 00:40:49,881
I can't remember the lyrics out of the blue.

1129
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:52,611
What? What's wrong with you?

1130
00:40:52,611 --> 00:40:53,881
Can you give me another chance?

1131
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,081
Please give us another chance.

1132
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:58,181
Please, Kwang Soo came all the way here.

1133
00:40:58,181 --> 00:40:59,511
Then take off your shoes.

1134
00:40:59,611 --> 00:41:01,381
- Okay. - Take off your shoes.

1135
00:41:01,611 --> 00:41:03,281
- Wear these. - Give us your shoe.

1136
00:41:03,281 --> 00:41:05,351
- What? - Give us your shoe.

1137
00:41:05,981 --> 00:41:07,281
You're taking my shoe away again?

1138
00:41:07,751 --> 00:41:09,751
If you want another chance, you must give us your belonging.

1139
00:41:09,981 --> 00:41:12,851
- He used to betray me on the show. - Why should I?

1140
00:41:12,851 --> 00:41:15,111
Now that I'm in this position, I feel so much at ease.

1141
00:41:15,351 --> 00:41:16,711
This is so unfair.

1142
00:41:16,711 --> 00:41:18,381
(Is this necessary?)

1143
00:41:18,381 --> 00:41:20,781
- Did you not sing on purpose? - No, I really couldn't remember.

1144
00:41:21,181 --> 00:41:23,321
- May I take these slippers? - Yes.

1145
00:41:23,321 --> 00:41:25,321
(He gives up a shoe and gets another chance.)

1146
00:41:25,321 --> 00:41:26,381
Gosh.

1147
00:41:26,781 --> 00:41:29,251
Until that day when Mount Baekdu is worn away

1148
00:41:29,251 --> 00:41:31,251
And the East Sea's waters run dry

1149
00:41:31,381 --> 00:41:34,381
- You should have done this sooner. - Ouch!

1150
00:41:34,981 --> 00:41:36,411
Why didn't you sing earlier?

1151
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:39,911
He always attacks me instead of thanking me.

1152
00:41:40,711 --> 00:41:42,081
- Are you leaving? - Gary.

1153
00:41:42,351 --> 00:41:44,211
I'm not smiling because I'm happy.

1154
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:49,281
(With 3 hours 24 minutes left, here's what's going on.)

1155
00:41:49,911 --> 00:41:53,281
(They tired themselves out too much in the beginning.)

1156
00:41:53,881 --> 00:41:59,081
(Everyone seems tired.)

1157
00:41:59,681 --> 00:42:00,981
What's the score?

1158
00:42:01,081 --> 00:42:02,411
- Here it is. - Here it is.

1159
00:42:02,411 --> 00:42:03,781
Here comes the score.

1160
00:42:04,651 --> 00:42:06,181
Kwang Soo is back.

1161
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:07,881
- We only have a minute left. - I'll do it.

1162
00:42:07,881 --> 00:42:09,321
- Here. - Let's stop now.

1163
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:11,081
If you fail, you have to give them something.

1164
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,781
- What? - They took my shoe.

1165
00:42:12,851 --> 00:42:14,981
- Why? - Why did you fail?

1166
00:42:15,081 --> 00:42:18,881
Gary didn't remember the lyrics to "Your Scent".

1167
00:42:19,911 --> 00:42:21,651
- Really? - Give us more time.

1168
00:42:21,981 --> 00:42:24,351
- Come on. - You were so close.

1169
00:42:24,511 --> 00:42:26,611
The total score is 946.

1170
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:28,481
If we didn't fail that time, we would have made it.

1171
00:42:28,481 --> 00:42:30,751
Don't karaokes usually give extra minutes?

1172
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:33,681
We'll give you 30 minutes for 3 dollars.

1173
00:42:34,081 --> 00:42:35,321
I'll go to Gary's studio.

1174
00:42:35,321 --> 00:42:36,351
Go, Jong Kook.

1175
00:42:36,351 --> 00:42:38,411
- I'll get going. - Sing something easy, okay?

1176
00:42:38,411 --> 00:42:39,981
- Is he in the studio? - Yes.

1177
00:42:39,981 --> 00:42:41,411
- It's so far away. - Gosh.

1178
00:42:41,411 --> 00:42:42,881
Ji Hyo, you should sing.

1179
00:42:43,181 --> 00:42:45,481
It'll take Jong Kook...

1180
00:42:45,511 --> 00:42:47,251
- about 15 minutes. - Goodness.

1181
00:42:48,011 --> 00:42:49,381
Is it okay for us...

1182
00:42:49,711 --> 00:42:51,981
to keep visiting Gary when he said farewell last week?

1183
00:42:51,981 --> 00:42:53,111
He seemed flustered.

1184
00:42:53,111 --> 00:42:54,881
Wasn't he happy to see you?

1185
00:42:54,881 --> 00:42:55,881
He was.

1186
00:42:55,881 --> 00:42:56,981
(He was still happy to see us.)

1187
00:42:57,751 --> 00:43:00,581
(Aren't you happy to see me again, Gary?)

1188
00:43:00,651 --> 00:43:02,781
- You're lovely - There we go.

1189
00:43:03,111 --> 00:43:04,181
We made it, didn't we?

1190
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:07,411
- When Dad goes to work - Kiss, kiss, kiss

1191
00:43:08,451 --> 00:43:09,881
Wasn't that too easy?

1192
00:43:10,651 --> 00:43:13,251
- He's back. - We should sing...

1193
00:43:15,181 --> 00:43:16,251
- Hello. - Are you back already?

1194
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,611
- I wasn't that fast. - You should sing now.

1195
00:43:19,611 --> 00:43:24,551
(With 5 members succeeding, they earned a total of 10 dollars.)

1196
00:43:24,551 --> 00:43:28,181
(The last member to visit is...)

1197
00:43:28,181 --> 00:43:29,551
Gosh, Gary.

1198
00:43:29,551 --> 00:43:31,321
(It's Ji Hyo's turn.)

1199
00:43:31,321 --> 00:43:32,711
Last week,

1200
00:43:32,981 --> 00:43:35,181
I cried a lot when we said goodbye.

1201
00:43:35,351 --> 00:43:37,811
It's so embarrassing to see him again.

1202
00:43:37,811 --> 00:43:39,181
(Who knew they would meet again so soon?)

1203
00:43:40,911 --> 00:43:47,581
(She wanted to stay strong, but she couldn't.)

1204
00:43:47,581 --> 00:43:51,681
I'm sad to see you leave, Gary.

1205
00:43:52,611 --> 00:43:54,911
I support you in all of your endeavours. Good luck.

1206
00:43:57,451 --> 00:44:01,511
(So are you doing well?)

1207
00:44:03,381 --> 00:44:05,851
- Gary! - Hey.

1208
00:44:06,081 --> 00:44:07,811
- Gary! - Who's this?

1209
00:44:09,111 --> 00:44:11,181
- Gary, how have you been? - Ji Hyo.

1210
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:12,751
- Hello. - How have you been?

1211
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:14,481
(He looks awkward to see her again.)

1212
00:44:14,481 --> 00:44:16,081
How are things going?

1213
00:44:16,481 --> 00:44:18,881
Why aren't you wearing the clothes? Put them on now.

1214
00:44:18,881 --> 00:44:20,751
- Don't say that. - Let's go to work.

1215
00:44:21,251 --> 00:44:22,351
Hurry up.

1216
00:44:22,481 --> 00:44:23,851
Take a seat, Ji Hyo.

1217
00:44:24,251 --> 00:44:25,981
You should take a break.

1218
00:44:27,351 --> 00:44:29,551
To be honest,

1219
00:44:30,181 --> 00:44:32,081
it was very embarrassing to come here.

1220
00:44:32,081 --> 00:44:35,751
- Why? - I cried a lot last week.

1221
00:44:36,081 --> 00:44:38,911
- It's too early to meet again. - You...

1222
00:44:38,911 --> 00:44:40,951
When we met in private, you cried more.

1223
00:44:41,551 --> 00:44:43,681
That was...

1224
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,451
She didn't say a word for 20 minutes when we met in private.

1225
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:47,951
I really cried a lot that time.

1226
00:44:47,981 --> 00:44:51,711
- I texted him because I was angry. - I thought...

1227
00:44:52,851 --> 00:44:54,451
I thought she cried because she was sad to see me go.

1228
00:44:54,451 --> 00:44:55,481
She cried because she was angry.

1229
00:44:55,951 --> 00:44:57,311
I was upset.

1230
00:44:57,851 --> 00:44:59,311
She was thinking, "This jerk..."

1231
00:45:00,851 --> 00:45:02,481
Ji Hyo, how are things going?

1232
00:45:03,181 --> 00:45:05,251
I'm curious to know which team's winning.

1233
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:08,281
There are no teams today. We are all poor together.

1234
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:10,551
So we all need to earn money today together.

1235
00:45:10,551 --> 00:45:12,311
- Is this a group game? - Yes. Do you have some money?

1236
00:45:12,311 --> 00:45:13,951
(Do you have some money?)

1237
00:45:14,551 --> 00:45:15,581
Don't you have any money?

1238
00:45:15,981 --> 00:45:17,251
Do you have a lot of money?

1239
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,651
I do have money.

1240
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:20,911
How much do you have? Let me see.

1241
00:45:20,911 --> 00:45:23,151
- I actually have some money. - Gary.

1242
00:45:24,311 --> 00:45:26,911
Give me the bill that has a different colour from the rest.

1243
00:45:27,281 --> 00:45:29,181
- Do you mean this one? - Yes. That one.

1244
00:45:29,181 --> 00:45:31,581
- This isn't a 50-dollar bill. - I know it's not.

1245
00:45:31,581 --> 00:45:33,251
- This is fine. - Is a five-dollar bill okay?

1246
00:45:33,251 --> 00:45:36,081
A five-dollar bill is fine. It's already mine.

1247
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:38,751
If I could, I want to give the whole wallet to you.

1248
00:45:39,751 --> 00:45:43,151
- Ji Hyo, will you marry me? - Come on, Gary.

1249
00:45:43,851 --> 00:45:47,811
- Is this how we'll meet every week? - I think so.

1250
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:49,911
I was feeling...

1251
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:53,651
a bit nervous when I came to see you.

1252
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:55,651
(I was nervous to come see you again.)

1253
00:45:55,651 --> 00:45:58,051
(Ji Hyo, by any chance...)

1254
00:45:58,051 --> 00:45:59,811
Do you want to go back to being Monday Couple again?

1255
00:45:59,811 --> 00:46:01,011
- No. - Okay.

1256
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:03,551
The girl who can't say goodbye

1257
00:46:03,551 --> 00:46:05,981
The boy who can't leave

1258
00:46:06,211 --> 00:46:08,581
We don't love each other

1259
00:46:08,581 --> 00:46:11,151
So we can't be together

1260
00:46:11,381 --> 00:46:12,481
Is that it?

1261
00:46:12,911 --> 00:46:14,751
Was it a mission?

1262
00:46:15,181 --> 00:46:17,881
Let go. I thought you were singing it for me.

1263
00:46:18,251 --> 00:46:20,181
Now that you're done with this, are you going to leave me now?

1264
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:24,111
Are you going to call me next time when you record the show?

1265
00:46:24,111 --> 00:46:26,081
Put on your outfit already.

1266
00:46:26,081 --> 00:46:28,211
(Everyone succeeds in Sing Along Relay.)

1267
00:46:28,211 --> 00:46:30,081
- Didn't everyone succeed? - We all succeed.

1268
00:46:30,211 --> 00:46:32,751
This is a hit among senior citizens.

1269
00:46:33,051 --> 00:46:35,851
(The game is over, but karaoke isn't.)

1270
00:46:35,851 --> 00:46:36,981
Let's hurry.

1271
00:46:39,651 --> 00:46:44,581
(Hold on. He begins to sing passionately.)

1272
00:46:44,581 --> 00:46:45,581
Whose song is this?

1273
00:46:45,581 --> 00:46:46,681
(She stops the song.)

1274
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:48,211
I feel empty

1275
00:46:48,381 --> 00:46:50,181
(You are the guide. Lead the way.)

1276
00:46:50,181 --> 00:46:51,481
Ji Hyo, I should...

1277
00:46:51,481 --> 00:46:53,081
- finish the song at least. - Ji Hyo is so decisive.

1278
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:54,311
I need to finish singing the song.

1279
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,551
- Ji Hyo. - You are determined, Ji Hyo.

1280
00:46:55,551 --> 00:46:57,181
Jae Seok, you should sing it while we're moving.

1281
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:59,211
- You can sing it in the car. - Let's go to Andong Station.

1282
00:46:59,211 --> 00:47:00,481
Use that microphone.

1283
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:02,751
(Sing Along Relay is completed.)

1284
00:47:02,751 --> 00:47:04,381
(Moving onto the mission at Photo Zone)

1285
00:47:04,551 --> 00:47:05,681
Is this it?

1286
00:47:05,681 --> 00:47:07,111
- There's a photo booth right here. - The photo booth's here.

1287
00:47:07,111 --> 00:47:08,311
- It's here. - It's right here.

1288
00:47:08,481 --> 00:47:09,651
It's been so long since I've been here.

1289
00:47:09,651 --> 00:47:10,981
I've never taken pictures here even when I was young.

1290
00:47:10,981 --> 00:47:12,681
- How much is it? - They're starting to turn up now.

1291
00:47:12,681 --> 00:47:14,911
- Yes, they are trending again. - I only took my passport photo.

1292
00:47:14,911 --> 00:47:16,311
You've never taken pictures at the booth?

1293
00:47:16,311 --> 00:47:17,551
- Only for my passport picture. - How much is it?

1294
00:47:17,681 --> 00:47:21,651
In order to take the photo, it costs four dollars.

1295
00:47:21,651 --> 00:47:22,851
No. I won't take it, then.

1296
00:47:22,851 --> 00:47:24,311
- Isn't it two dollars? - Is it that expensive?

1297
00:47:24,781 --> 00:47:25,811
The price went up.

1298
00:47:25,811 --> 00:47:27,551
- Sir. - Four dollars is a lot.

1299
00:47:27,551 --> 00:47:29,251
- Again, there is another mission. - What is it?

1300
00:47:29,311 --> 00:47:31,951
With this mission, you can get a full refund.

1301
00:47:32,211 --> 00:47:34,111
- This is great. - We have to get this.

1302
00:47:34,111 --> 00:47:35,881
- Let's go. - Now we are talking.

1303
00:47:35,881 --> 00:47:37,751
Take a picture from this booth.

1304
00:47:37,751 --> 00:47:42,181
If you manage to put a picture on the back of Gary's phone,

1305
00:47:42,281 --> 00:47:44,011
we will give you a full refund.

1306
00:47:44,011 --> 00:47:46,381
If you are going to keep bringing him in, then reinstate him.

1307
00:47:46,381 --> 00:47:48,581
- Let's just bring him back. - This is too much.

1308
00:47:48,581 --> 00:47:49,981
It'll be better to just hire him again.

1309
00:47:49,981 --> 00:47:52,011
Do we have to do it in secret?

1310
00:47:52,011 --> 00:47:53,781
- Did you say it's four dollars? - It's expensive.

1311
00:47:54,181 --> 00:47:56,281
- Come on. - It must really cost four dollars.

1312
00:47:56,281 --> 00:47:57,781
It's been a while, though.

1313
00:47:57,781 --> 00:48:00,151
- The photo will be so bright. - Ji Hyo should be in the middle.

1314
00:48:00,151 --> 00:48:01,211
- Should I be in the middle? - Let me go to the back.

1315
00:48:01,911 --> 00:48:03,011
It's been a long time since I took a photo here.

1316
00:48:03,451 --> 00:48:06,111
- Hit the button for a clear photo. - Come in.

1317
00:48:06,111 --> 00:48:08,081
We can even write 7012 on the photo.

1318
00:48:08,081 --> 00:48:10,251
Is that so? Then we have to write it down.

1319
00:48:10,251 --> 00:48:12,251
- Lower yourselves a little. - Make sure everyone's in the frame.

1320
00:48:12,251 --> 00:48:13,981
- Hey. - The camera...

1321
00:48:13,981 --> 00:48:16,051
- Move back a little. - I can't see myself.

1322
00:48:16,051 --> 00:48:17,551
- Move a little. - Sit down.

1323
00:48:17,551 --> 00:48:18,711
Move back.

1324
00:48:19,251 --> 00:48:20,381
Okay. We're ready.

1325
00:48:20,381 --> 00:48:21,751
(Everyone's crammed into the frame.)

1326
00:48:22,081 --> 00:48:23,311
Smile.

1327
00:48:23,311 --> 00:48:25,451
(Smile)

1328
00:48:26,581 --> 00:48:27,681
One more.

1329
00:48:28,051 --> 00:48:29,751
(They are the cutest.)

1330
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:32,551
That was good.

1331
00:48:33,481 --> 00:48:34,481
Do a different pose.

1332
00:48:35,381 --> 00:48:37,781
(There is even a spot for Gary.)

1333
00:48:38,151 --> 00:48:39,311
What is that?

1334
00:48:39,381 --> 00:48:41,151
How many takes do we have left?

1335
00:48:41,181 --> 00:48:42,381
Two more takes left.

1336
00:48:42,381 --> 00:48:44,481
You stood up right before the photo was taken.

1337
00:48:45,081 --> 00:48:47,051
- We have to choose four photos. - That's it.

1338
00:48:47,911 --> 00:48:49,211
- We have to choose the pictures. - That's what the number was for.

1339
00:48:49,211 --> 00:48:50,211
This one...

1340
00:48:50,481 --> 00:48:52,051
- Not that one. - Stop that.

1341
00:48:52,451 --> 00:48:53,581
How can you choose that one?

1342
00:48:53,711 --> 00:48:54,981
Why would you pick that photo?

1343
00:48:55,281 --> 00:48:57,081
Why would you pick that photo?

1344
00:48:57,181 --> 00:48:58,311
Come on.

1345
00:48:58,681 --> 00:49:01,211
- You can't even see me. - Let's decorate.

1346
00:49:01,211 --> 00:49:03,081
- I'll decorate it. - Hey, you.

1347
00:49:03,081 --> 00:49:04,711
- Hey. - That's great.

1348
00:49:04,711 --> 00:49:06,981
- That looks nice. - What are you doing?

1349
00:49:07,581 --> 00:49:10,011
- Why are you drawing that? - That's good.

1350
00:49:10,251 --> 00:49:11,711
What kind of a picture is that?

1351
00:49:11,851 --> 00:49:13,381
I want to have one, too.

1352
00:49:13,381 --> 00:49:14,481
That's not a runny nose.

1353
00:49:14,481 --> 00:49:17,051
It looks like a noodle's coming out of my nose.

1354
00:49:17,051 --> 00:49:19,281
- The tour with Jae Seok is not bad. - It's not bad, right?

1355
00:49:19,281 --> 00:49:20,811
- This is fun. - That's right.

1356
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:24,581
- Let's go to Gary. - Let's stick it on his phone.

1357
00:49:24,581 --> 00:49:25,911
- How does that sound? - Great. Let's go.

1358
00:49:26,011 --> 00:49:27,781
- Should we go to his studio? - Yes, let's go to the studio.

1359
00:49:27,781 --> 00:49:29,051
- Let's go. - Let's raid his place.

1360
00:49:29,681 --> 00:49:32,451
- Is it okay to go, though? - If people saw us...

1361
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,911
How many times are we going to his place today?

1362
00:49:35,351 --> 00:49:38,481
I think we are being a bit too clingy.

1363
00:49:38,481 --> 00:49:40,281
I feel sorry for Gary now.

1364
00:49:40,281 --> 00:49:41,451
It's like we're going there...

1365
00:49:41,451 --> 00:49:42,811
- after a breakup. - Exactly.

1366
00:49:42,811 --> 00:49:44,251
This is just like his song,

1367
00:49:44,251 --> 00:49:47,281
"Can't Breakup Girl, Can't Breakaway Boy".

1368
00:49:47,281 --> 00:49:50,551
It's the same as calling and going to the house after breaking up.

1369
00:49:50,551 --> 00:49:53,051
It's like keep clinging onto that person.

1370
00:49:53,051 --> 00:49:54,481
(You are watching how the song is turning into a reality.)

1371
00:49:54,481 --> 00:49:55,951
Jae Seok.

1372
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,111
Why is there a dog?

1373
00:49:57,111 --> 00:49:59,081
- A dog? - This dog is really cute.

1374
00:49:59,911 --> 00:50:01,111
Gary, what is this dog doing here?

1375
00:50:01,211 --> 00:50:02,551
- This dog is really cute. - Why are you...

1376
00:50:03,081 --> 00:50:04,281
This looks like a cat.

1377
00:50:04,281 --> 00:50:05,481
Why is there a dog?

1378
00:50:06,051 --> 00:50:07,111
What kind of breed is this?

1379
00:50:07,111 --> 00:50:09,111
Gary, we feel sorry to barge in like this.

1380
00:50:09,111 --> 00:50:11,781
- No, that's okay. I like it. - What were you doing? It's Monday.

1381
00:50:11,781 --> 00:50:13,951
You look a bit down than before.

1382
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,181
You are bugging me a little.

1383
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:18,681
Are you sure it's not a cat?

1384
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:20,281
- Isn't the dog cute? - Isn't the dog the cutest?

1385
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:23,681
- The dog is so gentle. - I really like this dog.

1386
00:50:23,681 --> 00:50:25,381
The dog is so calm in Jong Kook's arms.

1387
00:50:25,381 --> 00:50:27,551
- Is the dog violent? - Hurry up.

1388
00:50:27,581 --> 00:50:28,851
No, the dog's not violent.

1389
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:30,751
This is Gary's wallet.

1390
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,381
This is his laptop.

1391
00:50:33,581 --> 00:50:35,051
Get someone to put the photo on his phone.

1392
00:50:35,311 --> 00:50:36,751
Let's put the photos on his stuff.

1393
00:50:36,811 --> 00:50:39,051
That's it. This is great.

1394
00:50:39,051 --> 00:50:41,281
(She sticks a photo on the laptop, and he puts one inside his wallet.)

1395
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,251
I don't know if he's going to take these off later.

1396
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,881
(The sticky photos are papered all over Gary's belongings.)

1397
00:50:48,881 --> 00:50:50,051
Can you spot it easily?

1398
00:50:50,051 --> 00:50:52,051
(Even his phone is papered with the photo.)

1399
00:50:52,051 --> 00:50:53,211
Didn't you stick it upside down?

1400
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,151
7012.

1401
00:50:56,081 --> 00:50:59,111
It's 7, 0, 1 and 2.

1402
00:50:59,111 --> 00:51:00,711
(They complete the mission and manage to get a full refund.)

1403
00:51:02,011 --> 00:51:03,551
(Pet lover Jong Kook has no interest in the mission.)

1404
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,181
- The dog was about to fall asleep. - Sorry.

1405
00:51:05,181 --> 00:51:07,051
Hey, try to treat your colleagues like this.

1406
00:51:07,381 --> 00:51:09,081
- Do you hear me? - This is a new side of him.

1407
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:11,811
Have you ever treated Kwang Soo this way?

1408
00:51:11,811 --> 00:51:13,581
I'm no better than a dog.

1409
00:51:14,011 --> 00:51:15,711
- You've never been nice to them. - Hey.

1410
00:51:15,711 --> 00:51:17,581
It's because you don't look as cute as this dog.

1411
00:51:17,781 --> 00:51:19,751
I kind of look like a dog.

1412
00:51:19,751 --> 00:51:20,881
Come here. I'll take care of you.

1413
00:51:20,881 --> 00:51:22,651
(Come here, my little puppy.)

1414
00:51:22,651 --> 00:51:25,481
No. Don't treat me like this.

1415
00:51:25,481 --> 00:51:26,681
I'm doing it exactly the same.

1416
00:51:26,681 --> 00:51:29,451
- This is not what I meant. - This is the same.

1417
00:51:29,451 --> 00:51:30,581
I mean this is...

1418
00:51:30,581 --> 00:51:31,751
- He looks very comfortable. - Seriously,

1419
00:51:31,751 --> 00:51:33,081
you can be loved, too.

1420
00:51:33,081 --> 00:51:34,111
Is it a male?

1421
00:51:34,111 --> 00:51:35,451
- Yes, it's a male dog. - Were you scared?

1422
00:51:35,851 --> 00:51:36,951
Did they scare you?

1423
00:51:37,551 --> 00:51:38,981
- My goodness. - Why?

1424
00:51:38,981 --> 00:51:40,781
- I think the dog is scared of you. - Jong Kook,

1425
00:51:40,781 --> 00:51:43,111
you scared me.

1426
00:51:43,111 --> 00:51:44,211
Goodbye.

1427
00:51:44,281 --> 00:51:45,481
Come here.

1428
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:46,951
(Barking)

1429
00:51:46,951 --> 00:51:48,851
(Apparently, the dog can treat people differently.)

1430
00:51:48,851 --> 00:51:50,281
- The dog almost bit you. - Usually,

1431
00:51:50,281 --> 00:51:51,951
this dog doesn't bark.

1432
00:51:51,951 --> 00:51:53,311
- The dog really almost bit him. - Did you see that?

1433
00:51:53,311 --> 00:51:55,951
Did you see how the dog moved away from him?

1434
00:51:56,251 --> 00:51:58,481
The dog barked.

1435
00:51:58,581 --> 00:52:00,211
The dog is really adorable.

1436
00:52:00,481 --> 00:52:02,381
- The dog is really cute, indeed. - Okay, we should get going.

1437
00:52:02,381 --> 00:52:04,251
Should I go stand in my spot?

1438
00:52:04,451 --> 00:52:05,881
We just came to say hi.

1439
00:52:05,881 --> 00:52:06,981
Is that really it?

1440
00:52:06,981 --> 00:52:08,681
There are no secret missions, right?

1441
00:52:08,681 --> 00:52:10,381
We completed all the missions before.

1442
00:52:10,381 --> 00:52:11,951
- Let's go. - We're going now.

1443
00:52:11,951 --> 00:52:13,051
Hey, Haha.

1444
00:52:13,051 --> 00:52:15,651
- We came because we felt sorry. - I'll walk you out.

1445
00:52:15,651 --> 00:52:17,351
- No, that's fine. - We really came to greet you.

1446
00:52:17,711 --> 00:52:18,951
You really don't have a secret mission?

1447
00:52:20,151 --> 00:52:21,451
- Is this it? - Yes.

1448
00:52:21,451 --> 00:52:23,881
If you want something to eat, let me know in advance next time.

1449
00:52:24,311 --> 00:52:26,481
It's only finished when the show is finished.

1450
00:52:26,481 --> 00:52:28,651
(Mission at the photo booth is completed.)

1451
00:52:28,651 --> 00:52:30,311
(Next stop is Han River.)

1452
00:52:31,311 --> 00:52:34,281
If we go at this pace, the parking fee will be expensive.

1453
00:52:34,281 --> 00:52:36,251
- I forgot about that. - That's right.

1454
00:52:36,581 --> 00:52:39,481
- Here's our ticket. - We still have to pay a little.

1455
00:52:39,481 --> 00:52:40,911
The first hour is free.

1456
00:52:41,111 --> 00:52:42,551
- So the fee will be two dollars. - Is it?

1457
00:52:42,551 --> 00:52:44,751
- It's only 2 dollars. - It's good the 1st hour was free.

1458
00:52:45,281 --> 00:52:46,581
- Thank you. - Bye.

1459
00:52:47,011 --> 00:52:48,381
We even have a five-dollar bill.

1460
00:52:48,651 --> 00:52:51,381
- Ji Hyo, we need more gas. - She is so economical.

1461
00:52:51,911 --> 00:52:52,981
- Jae Seok. - Yes?

1462
00:52:53,111 --> 00:52:57,081
Isn't it embarrassing to put in only a litre?

1463
00:52:57,381 --> 00:52:59,181
- We have no other choice. - What are you going to say?

1464
00:52:59,181 --> 00:53:01,481
We just need to say we only want two dollars worth of gas.

1465
00:53:02,281 --> 00:53:03,451
Here you go.

1466
00:53:04,911 --> 00:53:08,311
- Ji Hyo, you are embarrassed, too. - You need to do it.

1467
00:53:08,311 --> 00:53:10,481
It will only literally take one second to fill the gas.

1468
00:53:11,481 --> 00:53:12,581
It'll take not even one second.

1469
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:15,851
- The gas is expensive here. - Yes, it is.

1470
00:53:16,581 --> 00:53:18,581
- We could use our coins. - We need diesel.

1471
00:53:19,711 --> 00:53:22,581
- Hello, aren't you Jae Seok? - Hello.

1472
00:53:22,581 --> 00:53:24,651
We only have two dollars for the gas.

1473
00:53:24,651 --> 00:53:25,781
- Only two dollars? - Please.

1474
00:53:26,881 --> 00:53:28,481
I'm sorry.

1475
00:53:29,181 --> 00:53:30,381
(You must feel baffled.)

1476
00:53:30,381 --> 00:53:32,381
You must feel baffled. I'm sorry.

1477
00:53:32,381 --> 00:53:34,181
I apologise. We don't have enough money.

1478
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:36,711
It's done already.

1479
00:53:36,711 --> 00:53:38,451
- Is it done? - It's all done.

1480
00:53:38,451 --> 00:53:39,911
He put in 1.2 litres.

1481
00:53:39,911 --> 00:53:41,751
Wow. That was more than I expected.

1482
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:43,451
- With 1.2 litres... - How far can you go with that?

1483
00:53:44,181 --> 00:53:46,681
- Why isn't the arrow moving? - It will.

1484
00:53:47,081 --> 00:53:48,951
- Did he put the gas already? - He did.

1485
00:53:48,951 --> 00:53:50,111
- The arrow will move soon. - Did he put some?

1486
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:51,911
- Can you check one more time? - Was it two dollars worth of gas?

1487
00:53:53,111 --> 00:53:54,481
That won't even get a free water, right?

1488
00:53:55,351 --> 00:53:57,251
Forget I asked.

1489
00:53:57,251 --> 00:53:59,451
- That's okay. We'll come back. - We'll put in a lot of gas, then.

1490
00:53:59,481 --> 00:54:01,711
But he did bring the free water bottle out.

1491
00:54:01,711 --> 00:54:02,811
- Please, just take it. - No, you don't need to.

1492
00:54:02,811 --> 00:54:04,651
We'll be okay. That's fine.

1493
00:54:04,881 --> 00:54:06,581
Okay, then. Thank you.

1494
00:54:06,581 --> 00:54:07,881
- I'm sorry. - Goodbye.

1495
00:54:07,881 --> 00:54:09,551
- I feel bad. - I was getting thirsty.

1496
00:54:09,551 --> 00:54:10,581
I feel horrible.

1497
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:11,681
Pass the bottle after you're done.

1498
00:54:12,381 --> 00:54:14,281
But I don't think the arrow's moving.

1499
00:54:14,381 --> 00:54:16,581
- I'm sure they put in the gas. - Can we move at least 6km?

1500
00:54:17,051 --> 00:54:19,281
- The car won't stop, though, right? - No, it won't.

1501
00:54:19,281 --> 00:54:21,781
That extra litre makes me feel relieved.

1502
00:54:21,781 --> 00:54:24,281
- I do feel different. - I feel like the car got stronger.

1503
00:54:24,281 --> 00:54:27,151
- He gave us more than a litre. - It was 1.29 litres.

1504
00:54:28,311 --> 00:54:29,581
But I...

1505
00:54:29,851 --> 00:54:32,911
don't feel like Gary left the show since I saw him today.

1506
00:54:33,051 --> 00:54:34,081
I know.

1507
00:54:34,251 --> 00:54:36,151
We said goodbye last week and here we are again.

1508
00:54:36,351 --> 00:54:38,211
It feels like just another mission.

1509
00:54:40,211 --> 00:54:44,711
(Right, Gary?)

1510
00:54:44,711 --> 00:54:47,551
(Seok Jin falls asleep...)

1511
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,811
Stop that.

1512
00:54:49,811 --> 00:54:52,481
(on his way to meet Gary again.)

1513
00:54:52,481 --> 00:54:53,711
Do you think the car will stop midway?

1514
00:54:53,711 --> 00:54:56,181
No. I doubt it.

1515
00:54:56,181 --> 00:54:58,551
(He's looking for Gary in his sleep.)

1516
00:54:58,551 --> 00:54:59,651
(Glancing)

1517
00:54:59,651 --> 00:55:01,481
Sir, you can't sleep there.

1518
00:55:02,081 --> 00:55:04,111
(Is that you, Gary?)

1519
00:55:04,111 --> 00:55:05,611
(You're not Gary.)

1520
00:55:05,811 --> 00:55:07,851
We're supposed to be working here.

1521
00:55:07,851 --> 00:55:10,211
- He fell asleep? - I told you we're low on gas.

1522
00:55:10,211 --> 00:55:13,581
Couldn't you wake me up more gently? You scared me.

1523
00:55:14,251 --> 00:55:16,351
I was wondering why it was so quiet.

1524
00:55:16,351 --> 00:55:17,551
Were you sleeping?

1525
00:55:17,551 --> 00:55:18,911
- Yes. - Gosh.

1526
00:55:18,911 --> 00:55:19,951
I wanted to get some sleep, too.

1527
00:55:20,351 --> 00:55:21,651
What do you think you're doing?

1528
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,251
I'm trying to save up my energy.

1529
00:55:23,251 --> 00:55:24,351
That was a bad timing.

1530
00:55:24,351 --> 00:55:25,711
How can you fall asleep?

1531
00:55:25,711 --> 00:55:27,211
I was about to ask if he's sleeping.

1532
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:29,051
- You should know better. - You scared me.

1533
00:55:29,051 --> 00:55:31,251
- We're even low on gas. - That was funny.

1534
00:55:31,251 --> 00:55:32,811
There's only 1km worth of gas left.

1535
00:55:32,811 --> 00:55:35,011
(They finally arrive at the Han River.)

1536
00:55:36,051 --> 00:55:37,611
We have to pay for parking again.

1537
00:55:38,211 --> 00:55:39,851
- How much do we have left? - Welcome.

1538
00:55:39,911 --> 00:55:41,951
We have about 10 dollars left.

1539
00:55:42,081 --> 00:55:43,651
Everything costs money.

1540
00:55:44,351 --> 00:55:45,451
That's so true.

1541
00:55:45,451 --> 00:55:48,181
It's just like what our parents said.

1542
00:55:48,181 --> 00:55:49,951
Everything costs money.

1543
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:55,111
(They have 10 dollars and 68 cents left.)

1544
00:55:55,111 --> 00:55:56,481
It's gotten colder.

1545
00:55:56,911 --> 00:55:59,651
Goodness. You're wearing a jacket.

1546
00:55:59,651 --> 00:56:01,451
Can I exchange this for the other pair of my shoes?

1547
00:56:01,711 --> 00:56:02,751
No.

1548
00:56:02,911 --> 00:56:05,011
(He's been missing a shoe for the past 2 hours.)

1549
00:56:06,451 --> 00:56:09,081
There are only six bicycles here.

1550
00:56:09,081 --> 00:56:12,281
(Does the mission have something to do with bicycles?)

1551
00:56:13,851 --> 00:56:14,911
This mission is called...

1552
00:56:15,711 --> 00:56:19,251
"Bicycle Ride" where you can ride a bicycle around here.

1553
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:21,481
- I'm freezing to death right now. - It's cold.

1554
00:56:21,481 --> 00:56:23,981
Somewhere around this park,

1555
00:56:24,111 --> 00:56:26,881
there is an R flag you have to find in order to complete the mission.

1556
00:56:27,081 --> 00:56:28,451
But it's so cold.

1557
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:30,481
The price for renting the bicycles is...

1558
00:56:30,481 --> 00:56:31,681
The price for renting the bicycles is...

1559
00:56:33,081 --> 00:56:35,481
two dollars per bicycle.

1560
00:56:36,711 --> 00:56:38,481
- What did you say? - Are you playing with us?

1561
00:56:38,481 --> 00:56:40,251
(You're a robber not a director.)

1562
00:56:40,251 --> 00:56:41,851
Are you looking down on us because we're broke?

1563
00:56:41,851 --> 00:56:43,651
We still have shopping to do.

1564
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:44,651
How much do we have?

1565
00:56:44,751 --> 00:56:47,151
However, you'll also get...

1566
00:56:47,481 --> 00:56:48,951
- a chance to save money. - How?

1567
00:56:48,951 --> 00:56:52,851
(There's a hidden mission for getting a refund.)

1568
00:56:52,851 --> 00:56:54,051
Go to Gary's studio...

1569
00:56:54,981 --> 00:56:56,981
(Gary again?)

1570
00:56:57,451 --> 00:56:59,051
- Again? - Stop it already.

1571
00:56:59,211 --> 00:57:00,951
- We're going there again? - How many times do we have to go?

1572
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:02,381
- From here? - You're driving me insane.

1573
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:03,911
You have to steal his bicycle.

1574
00:57:04,551 --> 00:57:07,011
(You want us to steal the bicycle again?)

1575
00:57:07,011 --> 00:57:08,351
- What bicycle? - What are you talking about?

1576
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:10,681
- He doesn't like us doing that. - He caught me last time.

1577
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,551
(A week ago)

1578
00:57:13,551 --> 00:57:17,581
(Seok Jin got caught red-handed stealing Gary's bicycle.)

1579
00:57:17,581 --> 00:57:20,981
(The owner stood guard to protect his bicycle.)

1580
00:57:22,081 --> 00:57:24,211
Why are you making us steal his bicycle?

1581
00:57:24,481 --> 00:57:26,951
Why can't you just leave him be?

1582
00:57:26,951 --> 00:57:29,811
Gary's gone now. Accept reality!

1583
00:57:29,951 --> 00:57:32,111
I don't want to say goodbye again.

1584
00:57:32,111 --> 00:57:33,351
Do you know how embarrassing it is?

1585
00:57:33,351 --> 00:57:35,211
I don't want to do this any more.

1586
00:57:35,211 --> 00:57:37,951
Do you know how many times we said goodbye to him?

1587
00:57:38,151 --> 00:57:39,911
- That's right. - We did it over and over again.

1588
00:57:39,951 --> 00:57:42,981
I said goodbye to him four times now.

1589
00:57:43,811 --> 00:57:45,081
(Flag Team, Bicycle Team)

1590
00:57:45,081 --> 00:57:47,611
(After paying for the rental fee, they have 4 dollars left.)

1591
00:57:48,611 --> 00:57:49,651
We're really low on gas.

1592
00:57:49,651 --> 00:57:52,451
We have to stop at a gas station.

1593
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:53,481
We should.

1594
00:57:53,551 --> 00:57:55,111
Was his bicycle still there?

1595
00:57:55,251 --> 00:57:56,651
- Yes. - Really?

1596
00:57:56,651 --> 00:57:59,851
- Did you see them there? - It's right where you left it.

1597
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:02,681
This is embarrassing now.

1598
00:58:02,911 --> 00:58:04,551
I wish he's not there when we arrive.

1599
00:58:04,751 --> 00:58:06,911
Let's say he's there.

1600
00:58:06,911 --> 00:58:08,311
How are we going to steal it?

1601
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:11,451
I think you should lure him out.

1602
00:58:11,751 --> 00:58:13,911
Why should I do that?

1603
00:58:14,211 --> 00:58:16,011
We have to pay for parking.

1604
00:58:16,211 --> 00:58:18,851
- We might not have to. - We should.

1605
00:58:18,851 --> 00:58:20,581
- How much is it? It's one dollar. - One dollar.

1606
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:22,751
(This is just great.)

1607
00:58:22,751 --> 00:58:24,211
How much do we have left now?

1608
00:58:24,381 --> 00:58:26,651
(They have 3 dollars and 68 cents left.)

1609
00:58:26,651 --> 00:58:29,111
Everything costs money.

1610
00:58:29,251 --> 00:58:31,611
- That's right. - Wait, the gas.

1611
00:58:31,611 --> 00:58:33,251
We have to stop for gas.

1612
00:58:33,251 --> 00:58:37,051
There's a gas station on the way. It's better to do it now.

1613
00:58:37,051 --> 00:58:38,651
You're right.

1614
00:58:38,651 --> 00:58:41,351
That means we have to go there again.

1615
00:58:43,081 --> 00:58:45,111
Can we get two dollars' worth of gas? We don't have much money.

1616
00:58:45,111 --> 00:58:46,551
- Two dollars? - I'm sorry.

1617
00:58:46,551 --> 00:58:47,551
(They stopped at the gas station for two-dollars-worth of gas.)

1618
00:58:47,551 --> 00:58:48,951
I'm really sorry.

1619
00:58:50,381 --> 00:58:54,381
(Do we have to go through with this again?)

1620
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:56,251
This is 57 cents.

1621
00:58:56,251 --> 00:58:57,981
I don't think I can do this. I'm too embarrassed.

1622
00:58:58,211 --> 00:58:59,281
I should have sat in the back.

1623
00:58:59,481 --> 00:59:01,151
There might be other gas stations around.

1624
00:59:01,151 --> 00:59:03,451
- This is the same place. - I know.

1625
00:59:03,711 --> 00:59:05,151
We don't have a choice. Let's go.

1626
00:59:05,811 --> 00:59:06,951
This is so embarrassing.

1627
00:59:08,151 --> 00:59:09,311
It's a different guy this time.

1628
00:59:10,011 --> 00:59:11,981
There he is again.

1629
00:59:14,911 --> 00:59:16,351
Hello.

1630
00:59:16,751 --> 00:59:18,011
- Can we... - Two dollars, right?

1631
00:59:19,951 --> 00:59:22,651
(The rumour has spread already.)

1632
00:59:22,651 --> 00:59:25,381
Things are worse than before.

1633
00:59:26,111 --> 00:59:27,111
Can we get a litre of gas?

1634
00:59:27,111 --> 00:59:29,381
Can we get a litre of gas with a dollar and 48 cents?

1635
00:59:29,381 --> 00:59:31,681
- One dollar and 48 cents. - We're really sorry.

1636
00:59:32,981 --> 00:59:35,081
- Are you paying cash? - Yes.

1637
00:59:35,581 --> 00:59:38,851
- You can keep the change. - We're really sorry.

1638
00:59:38,851 --> 00:59:40,811
(They have 2 dollars and 13 cents left.)

1639
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:42,781
- We're sorry. - Thank you.

1640
00:59:43,051 --> 00:59:45,111
This is going to be so awkward.

1641
00:59:46,181 --> 00:59:49,111
(They're searching around the Han River on bicycles.)

1642
00:59:49,351 --> 00:59:52,151
Where's the flag?

1643
00:59:52,481 --> 00:59:54,711
(They have to hurry in order to do the next mission.)

1644
00:59:54,711 --> 00:59:55,951
I think they hid it somewhere around here.

1645
00:59:56,211 --> 00:59:57,711
Yes, in the fields.

1646
00:59:58,711 --> 01:00:00,911
This is a good place to hide things.

1647
01:00:00,911 --> 01:00:01,951
(They're on a search.)

1648
01:00:01,951 --> 01:00:03,181
How far do we have to go?

1649
01:00:04,781 --> 01:00:07,381
- We're here again. - My goodness.

1650
01:00:07,381 --> 01:00:10,251
(The Bicycle Team arrive at Gary's studio.)

1651
01:00:12,351 --> 01:00:14,811
What do we say to him?

1652
01:00:16,481 --> 01:00:18,451
(There's no time to be embarrassed.)

1653
01:00:18,451 --> 01:00:20,181
(They have to focus on the mission.)

1654
01:00:21,081 --> 01:00:24,111
(After Seok Jin's failed attempt to steal his bicycle,)

1655
01:00:24,111 --> 01:00:29,551
(Gary's been heavily guarding his bicycle.)

1656
01:00:29,551 --> 01:00:33,211
(Breach the security system and steal the bicycle once and for all.)

1657
01:00:33,211 --> 01:00:36,351
(What's their plan?)

1658
01:00:36,351 --> 01:00:40,211
(Ji Hyo will tightly mark Gary.)

1659
01:00:43,281 --> 01:00:45,011
- Gary. - Gary.

1660
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:47,981
(We're here again, Gary.)

1661
01:00:48,281 --> 01:00:49,811
(How is Ji Hyo intending to keep Gary busy?)

1662
01:00:49,811 --> 01:00:51,251
- I thought we were done. - Hey, Gary.

1663
01:00:51,711 --> 01:00:53,351
- We were. - Isn't it over?

1664
01:00:53,351 --> 01:00:55,051
- We were just passing by. - Gary.

1665
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:56,851
We have a mission.

1666
01:00:58,981 --> 01:01:01,811
(Why would you say that, Ji Hyo?)

1667
01:01:02,381 --> 01:01:05,551
Did you see the photo stickers we put on?

1668
01:01:05,551 --> 01:01:06,751
I did.

1669
01:01:06,751 --> 01:01:09,181
- Did you? - You have to find the hidden ones.

1670
01:01:09,181 --> 01:01:11,251
(We have to find them.)

1671
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:14,051
- How many did you find? - We have to look together.

1672
01:01:14,051 --> 01:01:15,481
- How many did you find? - I found three.

1673
01:01:15,481 --> 01:01:17,251
- Only three? - There should be three more.

1674
01:01:17,251 --> 01:01:19,351
- At least three more. - We have to look for them.

1675
01:01:19,351 --> 01:01:20,651
(They follow Ji Hyo's lead to trick Gary.)

1676
01:01:20,651 --> 01:01:21,951
How many did you find in this room?

1677
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:24,111
I found these.

1678
01:01:24,111 --> 01:01:25,451
(They spot the bicycle.)

1679
01:01:25,451 --> 01:01:27,851
There aren't any more left in this room, then.

1680
01:01:28,611 --> 01:01:31,851
(Keep Gary far away from the bicycle.)

1681
01:01:31,851 --> 01:01:34,381
We have to look in the other rooms.

1682
01:01:34,851 --> 01:01:36,351
- Were you surprised to see us? - Leave this room alone.

1683
01:01:36,351 --> 01:01:38,381
It's not like that.

1684
01:01:38,381 --> 01:01:40,951
- What are you talking about? - Weren't you surprised?

1685
01:01:40,951 --> 01:01:43,281
- I was. - I thought so.

1686
01:01:43,281 --> 01:01:45,851
(Let's go somewhere else.)

1687
01:01:45,851 --> 01:01:48,011
(They have marked the bicycle.)

1688
01:01:49,411 --> 01:01:50,951
You said you wanted to shoot with us.

1689
01:01:50,951 --> 01:01:51,951
I still do.

1690
01:01:51,951 --> 01:01:54,151
(They manage to keep Gary's attention off the bicycle.)

1691
01:01:54,181 --> 01:01:56,211
Maybe it's on the gift Kwang Soo gave me.

1692
01:01:56,211 --> 01:01:58,051
(Let's get to work.)

1693
01:01:58,651 --> 01:01:59,751
Is it this one?

1694
01:02:01,011 --> 01:02:03,351
What's in this room?

1695
01:02:03,351 --> 01:02:05,051
Let me take a look.

1696
01:02:05,051 --> 01:02:08,181
(Gary let his guard down.)

1697
01:02:09,651 --> 01:02:13,811
(Take him to another room already.)

1698
01:02:13,811 --> 01:02:15,551
(Now is the chance.)

1699
01:02:16,651 --> 01:02:19,751
(It's his second attempt to steal the bicycle.)

1700
01:02:22,151 --> 01:02:24,381
(Ji Hyo has her eyes on Gary.)

1701
01:02:24,381 --> 01:02:26,081
Weren't they in here before?

1702
01:02:26,351 --> 01:02:28,611
In this room? I can't remember.

1703
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:31,051
We're running out of time.

1704
01:02:31,251 --> 01:02:34,281
- Did you say six in total? - Yes.

1705
01:02:34,281 --> 01:02:35,711
(Something's not right.)

1706
01:02:37,351 --> 01:02:38,651
(Wait a minute.)

1707
01:02:38,651 --> 01:02:41,751
(Did Gary become suspicious?)

1708
01:02:41,751 --> 01:02:42,951
Gary. What's that?

1709
01:02:42,951 --> 01:02:44,251
(Where do you think you're going?)

1710
01:02:44,251 --> 01:02:48,011
(Ji Hyo stops him from leaving.)

1711
01:02:48,011 --> 01:02:52,611
(I can't hold him for much longer.)

1712
01:02:54,751 --> 01:02:57,111
Kwang Soo. I'll hand it over to you.

1713
01:02:57,111 --> 01:02:58,111
Go.

1714
01:02:58,111 --> 01:02:59,151
This is unbelievable.

1715
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:00,251
(Get moving.)

1716
01:03:01,751 --> 01:03:05,481
I think someone went in that room.

1717
01:03:05,551 --> 01:03:08,911
I was in that room with Jae Seok.

1718
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:10,011
I'm talking about the other room.

1719
01:03:10,011 --> 01:03:11,081
(It's the room with the bicycle.)

1720
01:03:11,081 --> 01:03:13,351
(This is getting close.)

1721
01:03:13,351 --> 01:03:16,981
(She has to come up with something quick.)

1722
01:03:16,981 --> 01:03:19,281
- Oh, really? Hold on. - Yes.

1723
01:03:20,011 --> 01:03:22,481
You're up to something, aren't you?

1724
01:03:22,551 --> 01:03:23,711
It's not like that.

1725
01:03:23,711 --> 01:03:25,351
I can tell when you're pulling something.

1726
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:26,911
(We have to leave now.)

1727
01:03:26,911 --> 01:03:28,751
I can tell when you're pulling something.

1728
01:03:28,751 --> 01:03:30,611
(Gary is getting closer.)

1729
01:03:31,711 --> 01:03:34,151
You're up to something, aren't you?

1730
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:38,011
(Get the bicycle and leave.)

1731
01:03:38,351 --> 01:03:39,951
I can tell when you're pulling something.

1732
01:03:40,751 --> 01:03:42,281
I can tell when you're pulling something.

1733
01:03:42,281 --> 01:03:43,281
Come over here quickly!

1734
01:03:43,281 --> 01:03:44,581
Quickly!

1735
01:03:44,581 --> 01:03:46,651
- We have to look in this room. - Come on.

1736
01:03:46,651 --> 01:03:48,481
- You have to come now. - Now?

1737
01:03:48,481 --> 01:03:50,811
- Sit tight, Gary. - What's going on?

1738
01:03:50,811 --> 01:03:52,011
- Come here. - Why?

1739
01:03:52,011 --> 01:03:53,151
(Something smells fishy.)

1740
01:03:54,451 --> 01:03:55,681
Why?

1741
01:03:56,011 --> 01:03:57,811
They're coming after us.

1742
01:03:57,811 --> 01:03:59,751
(They try to leave the site pretending someone's after them.)

1743
01:03:59,751 --> 01:04:01,181
You did a mission just now, didn't you?

1744
01:04:01,181 --> 01:04:03,081
- No. - Yes, you did.

1745
01:04:03,081 --> 01:04:04,551
I'll come back later, Gary.

1746
01:04:04,551 --> 01:04:06,311
They did something.

1747
01:04:07,711 --> 01:04:08,881
What did they do?

1748
01:04:10,151 --> 01:04:11,351
What's going on?

1749
01:04:12,681 --> 01:04:15,781
They're making me paranoid. It's so stressful.

1750
01:04:16,351 --> 01:04:17,851
What did they do?

1751
01:04:17,851 --> 01:04:20,711
(There was a bicycle there just 10 minutes ago.)

1752
01:04:21,811 --> 01:04:23,351
(It's in the thieves' hands now.)

1753
01:04:23,351 --> 01:04:24,611
Put it in there.

1754
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:25,951
(It's in the thieves' hands now.)

1755
01:04:26,711 --> 01:04:27,711
Let's hurry.

1756
01:04:29,151 --> 01:04:31,051
(They'll be able to get a refund for the rental fee.)

1757
01:04:31,051 --> 01:04:32,311
- How much time do we have left? - This is crazy.

1758
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:34,481
If it hadn't been for Ji Hyo, we'd be doomed.

1759
01:04:35,181 --> 01:04:36,811
- Wasn't it a good strategy? - Yes.

1760
01:04:37,111 --> 01:04:38,581
- Wasn't it great? - It was good.

1761
01:04:38,681 --> 01:04:40,651
Good job, everyone.

1762
01:04:40,651 --> 01:04:42,981
(They're excited to head back.)

1763
01:04:42,981 --> 01:04:44,751
I can't find where it is.

1764
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:46,951
Where is it?

1765
01:04:47,311 --> 01:04:49,011
Where am I?

1766
01:04:50,381 --> 01:04:52,181
This is already Dongjak Bridge.

1767
01:04:52,911 --> 01:04:55,151
Gosh, is that the flag?

1768
01:04:55,151 --> 01:04:56,811
(He biked for 5km.)

1769
01:04:58,981 --> 01:05:00,751
They put it so far away.

1770
01:05:02,881 --> 01:05:04,681
(Bicycle Team finds the flag.)

1771
01:05:04,681 --> 01:05:07,781
They hid it so far away. How could anyone find it?

1772
01:05:08,881 --> 01:05:11,551
There must be a reason why she brought me here.

1773
01:05:11,551 --> 01:05:13,911
Why did she lead me here?

1774
01:05:13,911 --> 01:05:15,381
(Gary is so oblivious.)

1775
01:05:15,381 --> 01:05:18,281
(He pretends to be smart and starts searching.)

1776
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:22,381
(He doesn't notice that his bicycle is missing.)

1777
01:05:23,311 --> 01:05:24,851
The photos are still here.

1778
01:05:29,711 --> 01:05:31,181
I found it.

1779
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:33,981
(He finds the photo sticker that's been there for a while.)

1780
01:05:33,981 --> 01:05:36,011
Didn't I find the right thing?

1781
01:05:37,411 --> 01:05:40,111
There must be more items to find.

1782
01:05:40,751 --> 01:05:43,011
Let me check my things.

1783
01:05:44,651 --> 01:05:45,651
Who could it be?

1784
01:05:45,651 --> 01:05:49,481
(Who is calling him at such an important moment?)

1785
01:05:50,151 --> 01:05:51,481
- Hello? - Gary.

1786
01:05:52,151 --> 01:05:54,111
I'm sorry, but something urgent came up.

1787
01:05:54,751 --> 01:05:57,881
We had to leave because they told us to go somewhere.

1788
01:05:58,411 --> 01:06:00,181
I found one more photo.

1789
01:06:00,781 --> 01:06:02,811
I found one more photo.

1790
01:06:02,811 --> 01:06:04,081
He found one more?

1791
01:06:05,351 --> 01:06:06,581
Goodness.

1792
01:06:06,581 --> 01:06:07,981
Yes! Gary said he found it.

1793
01:06:07,981 --> 01:06:09,351
- Did he finally find it? - He found it.

1794
01:06:09,351 --> 01:06:10,981
Where did you find it?

1795
01:06:10,981 --> 01:06:12,611
(Gary is working on a fake mission.)

1796
01:06:12,611 --> 01:06:15,181
- Was it in the wallet? - That's a difficult one to find.

1797
01:06:15,881 --> 01:06:17,851
Do I need to find anything else?

1798
01:06:17,851 --> 01:06:19,951
That's good for now.

1799
01:06:20,311 --> 01:06:22,351
Tell me now because I'm stressing out.

1800
01:06:22,711 --> 01:06:24,951
Do I have to do a mission right now?

1801
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:26,281
There are six items to find.

1802
01:06:26,551 --> 01:06:28,281
Do I have to let you know when I find them?

1803
01:06:28,281 --> 01:06:31,111
Yes, but I'll call you back.

1804
01:06:31,311 --> 01:06:32,881
Oh, all I have to do is find them?

1805
01:06:33,181 --> 01:06:36,581
Yes. I'm sorry, but I have to go.

1806
01:06:37,211 --> 01:06:38,681
I'm in a hurry. Sorry.

1807
01:06:38,681 --> 01:06:40,651
- Okay, talk to you later. - Bye.

1808
01:06:41,311 --> 01:06:42,781
Gosh, what's going on?

1809
01:06:42,781 --> 01:06:44,081
(He feels uneasy.)

1810
01:06:44,081 --> 01:06:47,481
This is more tiring than being a Running Man member.

1811
01:06:48,881 --> 01:06:50,651
He said he found another one.

1812
01:06:50,651 --> 01:06:51,811
Goodness.

1813
01:06:52,081 --> 01:06:55,811
What I told him to do didn't make sense.

1814
01:06:56,411 --> 01:06:57,811
He said he found another one.

1815
01:06:58,411 --> 01:07:01,011
I just can't believe that Gary quit Running Man.

1816
01:07:01,011 --> 01:07:02,411
He should just continue like this.

1817
01:07:02,411 --> 01:07:04,981
- He could continue... - I know.

1818
01:07:04,981 --> 01:07:05,981
working with us.

1819
01:07:05,981 --> 01:07:09,381
- Gary is hilarious. - He really is.

1820
01:07:09,381 --> 01:07:10,481
(See you often, Gary.)

1821
01:07:12,211 --> 01:07:13,311
(They have 1 hour left.)

1822
01:07:13,311 --> 01:07:15,111
- We succeeded the mission. - All right.

1823
01:07:15,481 --> 01:07:18,651
Here's a refund for the bicycle rental fee.

1824
01:07:18,881 --> 01:07:21,081
- What's the last part? - It's shopping.

1825
01:07:21,081 --> 01:07:24,111
Here's your last mission. With the money you have left,

1826
01:07:24,381 --> 01:07:26,351
buy something for Gary.

1827
01:07:26,351 --> 01:07:29,181
- What on earth are we doing? - Come on.

1828
01:07:29,181 --> 01:07:30,781
Why do we keep bothering Gary?

1829
01:07:30,781 --> 01:07:33,311
- Goodness. - What's wrong with you?

1830
01:07:33,311 --> 01:07:36,081
Buy him a couple item to finish today's mission.

1831
01:07:36,081 --> 01:07:38,281
- Goodness. - What's a couple item?

1832
01:07:38,281 --> 01:07:40,451
- It's some type of couple item. - Do we buy seven?

1833
01:07:41,111 --> 01:07:42,851
- Is this the place? - It's the first floor.

1834
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:44,181
It's a stationary store. Let's go.

1835
01:07:44,611 --> 01:07:45,911
How about pens?

1836
01:07:46,281 --> 01:07:48,051
How much is it?

1837
01:07:48,111 --> 01:07:50,911
(They must buy 7 items with 8 dollars.)

1838
01:07:51,081 --> 01:07:52,351
- It's 50 cents. - 50 cents?

1839
01:07:52,351 --> 01:07:54,851
How about this? We used to play marbles as kids.

1840
01:07:55,051 --> 01:07:56,551
- Couple marbles? - What do you think?

1841
01:07:56,551 --> 01:07:57,881
Should we get one each?

1842
01:07:58,251 --> 01:08:01,111
We can buy seven of these.

1843
01:08:01,881 --> 01:08:03,311
- That's a good idea. - Isn't it?

1844
01:08:03,481 --> 01:08:04,881
- Is it 50 cents each? - Is it really a good idea?

1845
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:07,481
- Are you sure? - Yes.

1846
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:09,551
- Playing marbles... - Is this a prank?

1847
01:08:09,681 --> 01:08:12,121
- Are marbles a good idea? - We played them before.

1848
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:13,651
- We played marbles a lot. - We played many games.

1849
01:08:13,651 --> 01:08:15,581
- That was one of our games. - There's a couple marble game?

1850
01:08:15,581 --> 01:08:17,351
Sir, how much is this?

1851
01:08:17,651 --> 01:08:19,751
How about this for 60 cents? There are 7 of these.

1852
01:08:20,311 --> 01:08:21,911
Gary often uses pens.

1853
01:08:22,481 --> 01:08:26,411
I don't think Gary would wear that around his neck.

1854
01:08:26,411 --> 01:08:27,651
- He'll play with these. - Would he play with marbles?

1855
01:08:27,651 --> 01:08:29,381
I don't think so.

1856
01:08:29,381 --> 01:08:31,481
When Gary sees it...

1857
01:08:31,481 --> 01:08:34,121
He doesn't have time to play marbles when he has to practise music.

1858
01:08:34,121 --> 01:08:35,151
These are better.

1859
01:08:35,151 --> 01:08:36,781
- These can be... - Marbles?

1860
01:08:36,781 --> 01:08:39,711
used as decoration in the house.

1861
01:08:39,711 --> 01:08:40,981
As decoration?

1862
01:08:40,981 --> 01:08:43,121
- Look. - Couple necklaces exist,

1863
01:08:43,121 --> 01:08:44,151
but not couple marbles.

1864
01:08:44,151 --> 01:08:45,281
How about a table tennis ball?

1865
01:08:45,281 --> 01:08:46,481
A couple table tennis ball?

1866
01:08:46,481 --> 01:08:48,351
- We play a lot of table tennis. - You're a genius.

1867
01:08:48,351 --> 01:08:49,451
We play table tennis.

1868
01:08:49,621 --> 01:08:52,581
Each of us can paint the ball.

1869
01:08:52,581 --> 01:08:54,481
Let's get couple necklaces or pens.

1870
01:08:54,481 --> 01:08:55,711
Let's get pens then.

1871
01:08:55,711 --> 01:08:56,851
(They decide to get pens.)

1872
01:08:56,851 --> 01:08:58,181
Is it 60 cents each?

1873
01:08:58,251 --> 01:09:00,351
Gary would better wear this pen.

1874
01:09:02,911 --> 01:09:04,551
Here it is.

1875
01:09:04,551 --> 01:09:06,711
(If they give the pen to Gary, they'll finish today's mission.)

1876
01:09:06,711 --> 01:09:09,451
- Does Gary even know it's missing? - No, he doesn't.

1877
01:09:09,481 --> 01:09:11,481
- Are you okay, Kwang Soo? - Yes.

1878
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:15,651
(They bring back the bicycle they stole.)

1879
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:20,411
(Did Gary notice that the bicycle was missing?)

1880
01:09:20,681 --> 01:09:21,711
Gary.

1881
01:09:23,751 --> 01:09:25,151
Why did you take my bicycle?

1882
01:09:25,281 --> 01:09:26,551
Did you not know?

1883
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:30,621
(He's shocked and scared.)

1884
01:09:30,621 --> 01:09:32,181
When did you take it?

1885
01:09:32,181 --> 01:09:33,351
Didn't you know?

1886
01:09:34,581 --> 01:09:36,651
Gosh, what are you doing?

1887
01:09:36,851 --> 01:09:38,551
We took...

1888
01:09:38,551 --> 01:09:40,621
- your bicycle. - I'm really sorry.

1889
01:09:42,081 --> 01:09:44,351
Today's episode was recorded without Gary.

1890
01:09:44,551 --> 01:09:46,351
Yes, he was with us.

1891
01:09:46,411 --> 01:09:47,621
What is he talking about?

1892
01:09:47,621 --> 01:09:49,811
Wasn't I the main guest today?

1893
01:09:50,051 --> 01:09:51,351
He was the main guest.

1894
01:09:51,351 --> 01:09:55,451
You finished all the missions within six hours.

1895
01:09:55,451 --> 01:09:57,051
(They succeeded the missions.)

1896
01:09:57,051 --> 01:09:58,211
Today was difficult.

1897
01:09:58,211 --> 01:09:59,751
Six hours was enough time.

1898
01:09:59,751 --> 01:10:01,121
Today was difficult.

1899
01:10:01,121 --> 01:10:02,551
With Gary's help...

1900
01:10:02,551 --> 01:10:04,451
Without his help, we couldn't have made it.

1901
01:10:04,451 --> 01:10:06,811
- Five dollars helped us a lot. - Really?

1902
01:10:06,811 --> 01:10:08,681
- Seriously. - You helped us a lot.

1903
01:10:09,451 --> 01:10:11,011
- He gave us five dollars. - Gary,

1904
01:10:11,011 --> 01:10:12,411
you can keep this.

1905
01:10:12,481 --> 01:10:14,011
- What is it? - It's the change.

1906
01:10:14,751 --> 01:10:16,451
- Come on, it's okay. - You should take it.

1907
01:10:16,451 --> 01:10:18,011
- Ji Hyo. - Keep it.

1908
01:10:18,011 --> 01:10:19,811
I didn't help you to take this money.

1909
01:10:19,811 --> 01:10:21,011
Keep it.

1910
01:10:21,011 --> 01:10:23,181
- Should I keep it... - Come on.

1911
01:10:23,181 --> 01:10:25,481
- as a souvenir? - That sounds good.

1912
01:10:25,481 --> 01:10:27,281
- You should keep it. - It's not that much.

1913
01:10:27,351 --> 01:10:29,751
Did you give him today's souvenir?

1914
01:10:29,751 --> 01:10:31,711
- I will now. - Gosh.

1915
01:10:31,711 --> 01:10:34,621
- You haven't yet? - It's our couple item.

1916
01:10:34,651 --> 01:10:36,151
(Haha sounds shy.)

1917
01:10:36,181 --> 01:10:37,981
You haven't given it to him yet?

1918
01:10:38,281 --> 01:10:39,581
- Here you go. - It's a souvenir.

1919
01:10:39,581 --> 01:10:42,351
- I see. - All of us have one each.

1920
01:10:42,951 --> 01:10:46,121
We'll be wearing it the next time we come back.

1921
01:10:46,121 --> 01:10:48,681
Do we become one when we do this?

1922
01:10:48,681 --> 01:10:50,121
- Like this? - Like this?

1923
01:10:50,551 --> 01:10:54,481
(See you in the Milky Way after a year.)

1924
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:56,411
Shouldn't Ji Hyo cry again?

1925
01:10:56,451 --> 01:10:58,911
- Well... - She texted him at 3am.

1926
01:10:59,481 --> 01:11:03,051
"Gary, I miss you."

1927
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:04,181
(She was too drunk to type.)

1928
01:11:04,181 --> 01:11:05,581
It was 3am.

1929
01:11:05,581 --> 01:11:08,211
She probably sent it after drinking a lot.

1930
01:11:08,281 --> 01:11:10,151
Is she going to sing...

1931
01:11:10,151 --> 01:11:12,311
a sad song for him?

1932
01:11:12,411 --> 01:11:13,621
- What is it? - It's nothing.

1933
01:11:13,621 --> 01:11:15,551
"There's no one as innocent as you."

1934
01:11:16,551 --> 01:11:18,481
"There's no one as innocent as you."

1935
01:11:19,081 --> 01:11:20,751
- Is that what she wrote? - Yes.

1936
01:11:20,751 --> 01:11:22,811
- Let me see. - Here it is.

1937
01:11:23,211 --> 01:11:24,281
Do you see it?

1938
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:26,011
Ji Hyo, what's wrong with you?

1939
01:11:26,011 --> 01:11:28,211
It was just that day.

1940
01:11:28,211 --> 01:11:31,281
She used the word "love" a lot that day.

1941
01:11:32,281 --> 01:11:34,281
She should have treated him better.

1942
01:11:34,481 --> 01:11:36,051
You should have treated him better.

1943
01:11:36,051 --> 01:11:37,811
I did treat him well.

1944
01:11:37,811 --> 01:11:40,251
- I did, didn't I? - You shouldn't brag.

1945
01:11:40,251 --> 01:11:41,281
By the way...

1946
01:11:43,651 --> 01:11:44,811
Well...

1947
01:11:45,911 --> 01:11:47,411
- Let's get going. - Okay.

1948
01:11:47,781 --> 01:11:48,781
Let's go.

1949
01:11:48,781 --> 01:11:50,481
Are you sure you're leaving?

1950
01:11:50,481 --> 01:11:51,781
Let's go already.

1951
01:11:51,781 --> 01:11:54,381
How many times do we have to do this?

1952
01:11:55,081 --> 01:11:57,911
- I'm so tired of it. - My chest is bruised.

1953
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:00,211
How was it for you today?

1954
01:12:00,211 --> 01:12:03,751
I really enjoyed it today.

1955
01:12:03,751 --> 01:12:06,121
- If you pass by my studio, - That sounds good.

1956
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:07,381
you should stop here for a meal.

1957
01:12:07,381 --> 01:12:08,481
That would be great.

1958
01:12:08,481 --> 01:12:10,411
Do you remember the Chinese restaurant?

1959
01:12:10,411 --> 01:12:12,651
We can order delivery from there.

1960
01:12:12,651 --> 01:12:14,981
- We couldn't eat enough today. - I'll order delivery next time.

1961
01:12:14,981 --> 01:12:17,621
- Okay. - Can you order the food now?

1962
01:12:19,311 --> 01:12:20,911
My goodness.

1963
01:12:21,251 --> 01:12:23,121
- All right, let's go. - See you.

1964
01:12:23,281 --> 01:12:24,681
We're really leaving this time.

1965
01:12:24,681 --> 01:12:26,651
- Are you really leaving? - Be a guest on the show every week.

1966
01:12:27,081 --> 01:12:28,451
I'll take the bicycle.

1967
01:12:29,151 --> 01:12:30,951
You might as well take it.

1968
01:12:30,951 --> 01:12:33,851
If the bicycle disappears one day, just know that it was me.

1969
01:12:33,851 --> 01:12:35,121
- Okay. - I'll take it later.

1970
01:12:35,121 --> 01:12:36,751
I'll assume that it was your mission.

1971
01:12:36,751 --> 01:12:38,981
- See you, Gary. - See you.

1972
01:12:38,981 --> 01:12:41,751
(They're like one big family.)

1973
01:12:41,751 --> 01:12:44,081
(Can you return the microphones?)

1974
01:12:44,081 --> 01:12:45,811
Give all of them to me.

1975
01:12:46,351 --> 01:12:48,681
- Bye, Gary. - Bye.

1976
01:12:48,681 --> 01:12:50,381
- Return this for me, too. - What?

1977
01:12:50,781 --> 01:12:52,711
This one. Bye.

1978
01:12:52,711 --> 01:12:54,151
(Return the mission bag, please.)

1979
01:12:56,851 --> 01:12:58,011
They don't fail to amaze me.

1980
01:12:58,781 --> 01:13:01,481
Don't take away the money they gave me.

1981
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:04,181
Let's wrap up. One, two, three.

1982
01:13:04,251 --> 01:13:05,281
Thank you.

1983
01:13:08,711 --> 01:13:10,881
The director and I hugged tightly last week.

1984
01:13:12,681 --> 01:13:14,711
Shouldn't I feel sad?

1985
01:13:15,451 --> 01:13:17,481
(All six members of Sechs Kies are back.)

1986
01:13:17,481 --> 01:13:19,121
(Hwangwoo Seul Hye)

1987
01:13:19,481 --> 01:13:22,051
(Sechs Kies and Hwangwoo Seul Hye are perfect together.)

1988
01:13:22,651 --> 01:13:25,481
(These are idol singers with 20 years of experience.)

1989
01:13:25,481 --> 01:13:29,281
(It's a competitive battle with the men's pride on the line.)

1990
01:13:29,481 --> 01:13:30,811
(However...)

1991
01:13:31,381 --> 01:13:34,781
(One of them is a food thief.)

1992
01:13:35,181 --> 01:13:37,381
(Catch the world's worst food thief.)

1993
01:13:37,381 --> 01:13:40,181
(There's a shocking twist behind the food.)

1994
01:13:42,121 --> 01:13:45,251
Why are you making us eat on the street?

1995
01:13:46,151 --> 01:13:48,351
- Gosh. - We look like paupers anyway.

1996
01:13:49,551 --> 01:13:51,681
(Food Thief Race on Sunday next week at 6:30pm)
