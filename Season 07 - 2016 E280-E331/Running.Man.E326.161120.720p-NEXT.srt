1
00:00:03,522 --> 00:00:07,562
(Beautiful Icheon where excellent quality rice grows)

2
00:00:10,762 --> 00:00:15,292
Our special guests today are waiting behind that door.

3
00:00:17,822 --> 00:00:18,862
Are they inside?

4
00:00:19,922 --> 00:00:23,192
(Today's special guests are waiting for Running Man members.)

5
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:24,662
Enter the door and meet them.

6
00:00:24,662 --> 00:00:25,822
There they are.

7
00:00:26,562 --> 00:00:27,922
- There they are. - I can see them.

8
00:00:27,922 --> 00:00:29,462
(They walk towards the door.)

9
00:00:34,362 --> 00:00:36,392
(Five members of Sechs Kies return.)

10
00:00:36,392 --> 00:00:38,322
(Jang Su Won, half human, half robot)

11
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:40,292
(Kim Jae Duck, an idol singer with accents)

12
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:42,492
(Kang Sung Hoon, a handsome vocalist)

13
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:44,562
(Eun Ji Won, the leader)

14
00:00:44,562 --> 00:00:45,992
(Lee Jae Jin, positive yet strange)

15
00:00:49,622 --> 00:00:50,922
They're all here.

16
00:00:50,962 --> 00:00:52,692
- Why are they posing? - Goodness.

17
00:00:52,692 --> 00:00:54,922
- Hello. - Some dyed their hair.

18
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:56,292
(They're trembling.)

19
00:00:56,722 --> 00:00:58,322
(That pose is so outdated.)

20
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:00,322
Long time no see.

21
00:01:00,592 --> 00:01:01,722
I haven't seen you in a while.

22
00:01:01,922 --> 00:01:03,322
You're such an old idol group.

23
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:05,822
You haven't changed at all.

24
00:01:05,822 --> 00:01:07,122
You look the same.

25
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:11,292
Today, Running Man and Sechs Kies...

26
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:14,092
will compete against each other.

27
00:01:14,092 --> 00:01:15,222
We're competing with them.

28
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:17,462
There are two ladies...

29
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:18,922
who will lead each of the team.

30
00:01:18,922 --> 00:01:20,262
- Ladies? - Ladies?

31
00:01:20,562 --> 00:01:21,792
Please come out.

32
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:25,322
(It's the first lady everyone waited for.)

33
00:01:25,322 --> 00:01:27,962
(Is it who we think she is?)

34
00:01:28,562 --> 00:01:32,922
(Who's the second lady who looks good under the garment?)

35
00:01:32,922 --> 00:01:33,992
Please come out.

36
00:01:34,062 --> 00:01:35,562
Is the lady whom I think it is?

37
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:37,962
(They can't wait to see who they are.)

38
00:01:39,062 --> 00:01:41,962
(Two ladies are as beautiful as the sunny weather.)

39
00:01:42,722 --> 00:01:44,892
(They're loyal to their ladies.)

40
00:01:45,492 --> 00:01:47,922
(They look shy and embarrassed.)

41
00:01:48,922 --> 00:01:50,822
Why is Ji Hyo covering herself?

42
00:01:50,922 --> 00:01:52,292
(She laughs shyly.)

43
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:55,122
Gosh, that's Hwangwoo Seul Hye.

44
00:01:55,762 --> 00:01:58,162
What's the point of this?

45
00:01:58,162 --> 00:02:00,222
They can see our faces anyway.

46
00:02:00,222 --> 00:02:01,822
(He looks happy.)

47
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:03,692
Hello.

48
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:05,092
(Today's special lady is Hwangwoo Seul Hye.)

49
00:02:05,662 --> 00:02:09,892
(With her unique loveliness, she acts in movies, TV and commercials.)

50
00:02:09,892 --> 00:02:14,292
(Now, she even appears in variety shows.)

51
00:02:15,432 --> 00:02:17,392
- You're on our team. - Hello.

52
00:02:17,992 --> 00:02:20,692
- Seul Hye. - Hello.

53
00:02:20,692 --> 00:02:22,592
By the way,

54
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,692
you curled your bangs too much. What's wrong with you?

55
00:02:26,692 --> 00:02:28,392
That was a popular hairstyle when I was in college.

56
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:30,462
She wanted to look younger.

57
00:02:30,462 --> 00:02:31,762
(Her hairstyle is perfect for her character.)

58
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:33,192
(He's full of smiles.)

59
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:36,162
Among the other team members, Sung Hoon is the prettiest.

60
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:39,492
- You look colorful. - Ji Hyo is the second prettiest.

61
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,292
When I said I'm an idol singer,

62
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:43,092
they dyed my hair like this at a beauty parlor.

63
00:02:43,922 --> 00:02:45,562
(A beauty parlor?)

64
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:47,562
(It's a place for haircuts and perms.)

65
00:02:48,462 --> 00:02:51,162
Seok Jin also went to a barbershop this morning.

66
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:54,162
I certainly did. I washed my hair like this, too.

67
00:02:54,492 --> 00:02:57,462
At barbershops, you wash your hair while leaning forward.

68
00:02:57,962 --> 00:03:00,362
You know what I mean? That's how you wash your hair.

69
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:02,092
Today is...

70
00:03:02,122 --> 00:03:03,792
ladies and servants'...

71
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:05,462
Food Thief Race.

72
00:03:05,462 --> 00:03:07,092
Food Thief Race?

73
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:08,322
Food thief?

74
00:03:08,992 --> 00:03:10,722
Among 10 servants,

75
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:13,492
one of you is a food thief.

76
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:15,792
(1 of the 10 servants is a food thief.)

77
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:17,392
(There is a food thief...)

78
00:03:17,392 --> 00:03:18,692
(among the servants?)

79
00:03:18,692 --> 00:03:21,062
- There's a food thief? - You punk.

80
00:03:21,062 --> 00:03:22,292
(We caught the thief.)

81
00:03:23,562 --> 00:03:24,562
Whenever this happens...

82
00:03:24,562 --> 00:03:25,862
We haven't selected the thief yet.

83
00:03:25,862 --> 00:03:27,462
They haven't selected the thief yet!

84
00:03:27,462 --> 00:03:28,662
They haven't selected the thief yet.

85
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:30,962
- They haven't selected one yet. - Isn't it you?

86
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:33,122
- They haven't selected him yet. - He doesn't look like he's lying.

87
00:03:33,122 --> 00:03:34,622
He doesn't look like he's lying.

88
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:36,492
The food thief...

89
00:03:36,492 --> 00:03:39,692
will be on a hidden mission in secret.

90
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:41,822
(The food thief will be given a hidden mission.)

91
00:03:42,092 --> 00:03:43,092
I see.

92
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:46,092
The 2 teams will compete 3 rounds.

93
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:48,992
If the food thief remains on your team after the final round,

94
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:50,192
your team loses.

95
00:03:50,192 --> 00:03:52,922
(Stay away from the food thief.)

96
00:03:52,922 --> 00:03:54,662
At the end of each round,

97
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:56,762
the lady of the winning team...

98
00:03:57,062 --> 00:03:58,562
will be given a hint about the food thief...

99
00:03:58,562 --> 00:04:00,922
and a chance to exchange a servant with the other team.

100
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:05,062
(It's advantageous to win each round.)

101
00:04:05,062 --> 00:04:06,992
She can exchange a servant.

102
00:04:06,992 --> 00:04:09,192
Do you see a pavilion back there?

103
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:11,062
When you get to the pavilion,

104
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:12,762
you'll find a row of rice in stone pots.

105
00:04:12,922 --> 00:04:15,492
When you open the stone pot, you'll find out if you're a food thief.

106
00:04:15,492 --> 00:04:19,292
(The one with soy sauce gejang in the stone pot is the food thief.)

107
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,862
(Accomplish your hidden mission and win 100 bags of rice.)

108
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,122
(If you succeed, you can donate rice under your name.)

109
00:04:23,122 --> 00:04:24,192
(If not, you're punished.)

110
00:04:26,022 --> 00:04:27,692
I'll be caught if I'm the thief.

111
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:29,462
(Suspicious Kwang Soo starts first.)

112
00:04:32,092 --> 00:04:34,862
(He's worried of getting caught if he's the food thief.)

113
00:04:34,862 --> 00:04:35,862
I...

114
00:04:37,092 --> 00:04:38,392
choose this one.

115
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:40,992
(He makes a random choice.)

116
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:44,792
(Is Kwang Soo the food thief?)

117
00:04:45,662 --> 00:04:47,322
If it's Kwang Soo, it'd be obvious.

118
00:04:47,322 --> 00:04:49,062
Kwang Soo seems very flustered now.

119
00:04:49,062 --> 00:04:51,262
I think he received the hidden mission.

120
00:04:51,462 --> 00:04:52,662
He's coming.

121
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:54,322
- What's going on? - Why is he running?

122
00:04:54,322 --> 00:04:55,892
Next up is Jae Jin.

123
00:04:57,662 --> 00:04:58,662
(He's nervous.)

124
00:04:58,662 --> 00:05:00,292
I'm not good at hidden missions.

125
00:05:00,762 --> 00:05:03,822
(He wants to avoid finding soy sauce gejang in his pot.)

126
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:09,922
Okay.

127
00:05:09,922 --> 00:05:11,062
(It's hard to tell.)

128
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:13,792
- He's already coming back. - He was quick.

129
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:15,362
- I'm next, right? - You're up, Haha.

130
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:17,562
Why did you take so long, Kwang Soo?

131
00:05:17,562 --> 00:05:19,692
I had to wait for them to set up the cameras.

132
00:05:19,692 --> 00:05:21,062
The cameras were already set up.

133
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:22,992
No, they really weren't.

134
00:05:22,992 --> 00:05:24,762
Kwang Soo is the food thief.

135
00:05:25,462 --> 00:05:27,222
Show them the camera.

136
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:29,562
The one that was in front of me.

137
00:05:31,692 --> 00:05:33,422
He looks too calm to be the food thief.

138
00:05:33,422 --> 00:05:34,962
Jae Jin, why are you smiling?

139
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:36,562
- Excuse me? - He looks flustered.

140
00:05:36,592 --> 00:05:38,022
Are you quite flustered?

141
00:05:38,022 --> 00:05:39,022
(Why is he smiling?)

142
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:40,462
(Haha hurries up to a pot.)

143
00:05:42,022 --> 00:05:44,062
(He looks suspicious.)

144
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:47,562
Kwang Soo is the thief because he took too long.

145
00:05:47,562 --> 00:05:49,192
It was because of the cameras.

146
00:05:49,192 --> 00:05:50,662
The staff didn't even talk to me.

147
00:05:50,992 --> 00:05:53,292
- The cameras weren't set up. - All you do is open the pot.

148
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:56,962
- Really? - Tell them I'm innocent.

149
00:05:57,292 --> 00:05:59,822
- The cameras weren't set up. - Come on.

150
00:05:59,822 --> 00:06:01,562
- It didn't take that long for me. - I'm being honest.

151
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,162
The cameras weren't set up.

152
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:05,292
(Nine servants)

153
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:08,922
(One food thief)

154
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:14,462
(Today's race depends on the food thief.)

155
00:06:14,822 --> 00:06:19,662
(The hidden mission is only given to the food thief.)

156
00:06:21,622 --> 00:06:27,762
(Who will be the food thief that will lead his team to victory?)

157
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:32,062
I think it's Haha.

158
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:33,392
- Why? I don't think so. - Me?

159
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,992
- I think it's Haha. - Why?

160
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:36,322
(She has a hunch that it's Haha.)

161
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:39,622
You're not very sharp, are you?

162
00:06:39,662 --> 00:06:42,992
I've worked with Seul Hye a few times.

163
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:44,522
She's...

164
00:06:44,692 --> 00:06:47,222
- She isn't sharp, is she? - very innocent but isn't sharp.

165
00:06:47,392 --> 00:06:48,992
She's quite dull.

166
00:06:49,662 --> 00:06:51,492
(He stares at others.)

167
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:54,222
Ji Won, what did you find in your stone pot?

168
00:06:54,492 --> 00:06:55,992
What did you find in your pot?

169
00:06:56,322 --> 00:06:57,962
(He hesitates.)

170
00:06:57,962 --> 00:06:59,792
- It's him. - It must be him.

171
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:02,392
The problem is that...

172
00:07:02,462 --> 00:07:03,862
Ji Won is good at...

173
00:07:03,862 --> 00:07:05,292
- looking suspicious. - That's right.

174
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,492
- Why would I do that? - He likes to act suspicious.

175
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:10,292
(Is that so?)

176
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:12,492
What was inside your pot?

177
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:14,762
Seul Hye, stop pretending to be sharp.

178
00:07:15,122 --> 00:07:16,422
Come on.

179
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,592
She wants to find out who the food thief is.

180
00:07:20,662 --> 00:07:21,762
(Food Thief Race, Round 1)

181
00:07:21,762 --> 00:07:24,122
This is the first round.

182
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:26,962
The food thief is already given the hidden mission.

183
00:07:26,962 --> 00:07:28,492
When did that happen?

184
00:07:28,492 --> 00:07:30,292
(When? To whom? I didn't see anyone.)

185
00:07:30,392 --> 00:07:31,822
It's the person who took a long time to get ready.

186
00:07:32,062 --> 00:07:34,092
It's Kwang Soo because he took the longest time.

187
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,962
I'm telling you. The cameras weren't set up.

188
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:40,992
Now, Seul Hye will show one of Sechs Kies' dances.

189
00:07:41,822 --> 00:07:42,992
(All eyes are on her.)

190
00:07:43,092 --> 00:07:44,722
Gosh, do I dance now?

191
00:07:45,462 --> 00:07:46,922
- Right now? - Now?

192
00:07:46,922 --> 00:07:49,062
Dancing when it's awkward is the best.

193
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:50,662
(Sechs Kies' dance is the best to break the ice.)

194
00:07:51,192 --> 00:07:52,492
Show us the dance now.

195
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:55,262
- She's taking her jacket off. - Goodness.

196
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:58,322
Our dances aren't usually for women.

197
00:07:59,392 --> 00:08:00,962
Show us the dance now.

198
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:02,922
("Road Fighter" by Sechs Kies)

199
00:08:02,922 --> 00:08:04,792
- This is it. - Gosh.

200
00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:09,322
(I'm not here as an actress right now.)

201
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,662
(I'm here as a fan of Sechs Kies.)

202
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:13,722
There she goes.

203
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,092
- Look at her. - She is pretty good.

204
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,362
- Look at her dancing. - She is nice.

205
00:08:21,522 --> 00:08:24,792
(Her footwork is good enough to surprise Sechs Kies members.)

206
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:28,222
(Sechs Kies fans will be surprised if they see her dancing.)

207
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:30,362
- What's the next move? - Just follow her lead.

208
00:08:30,562 --> 00:08:31,722
(Flipping)

209
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:34,162
(She is doing her best at dancing.)

210
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:35,192
- She is really good. - Yes, she is.

211
00:08:35,392 --> 00:08:37,462
- She is so good. - That's it.

212
00:08:38,222 --> 00:08:39,462
Go, Seul Hye.

213
00:08:39,462 --> 00:08:41,092
- She's so good. - She remembers all the moves.

214
00:08:41,092 --> 00:08:42,892
- She's so good. - Can you dance like her, Ji Won?

215
00:08:42,962 --> 00:08:44,962
(I remember this melody, too!)

216
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:49,062
("Couple" by Sechs Kies)

217
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,962
- Oh love - Oh love

218
00:08:51,262 --> 00:08:54,392
(Everyone naturally dances to this song.)

219
00:08:54,392 --> 00:08:55,522
- She's good. - Yes, she is.

220
00:08:55,892 --> 00:08:58,722
She's not a good dancer. She just remembers the moves well.

221
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:01,092
- Why did you come so late - Why did you come so late

222
00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:02,892
(Now, everyone dances together to the music with her.)

223
00:09:04,222 --> 00:09:05,922
Oh love

224
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:08,362
(Forget the mission. Let's dance for now.)

225
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:11,462
- I love you - I love you

226
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:20,092
(She remembers all the fine details. She must be their huge fan.)

227
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:22,562
(She acts flashy.)

228
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,392
(Ta-da)

229
00:09:26,162 --> 00:09:28,862
(She even finishes her dancing with their signature gesture.)

230
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:31,362
- Can I ask you a favor? - Really.

231
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,062
- She's really good. - I want to ask you only one favor.

232
00:09:33,062 --> 00:09:35,462
- Can you do this again, Seul Hye? - Please show us the footwork again.

233
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:37,332
- Seul Hye. - My gosh.

234
00:09:37,332 --> 00:09:38,592
- You're really good. - It's really embarrassing.

235
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:40,362
- That was amazing. - Seul Hye is an amazing dancer.

236
00:09:41,662 --> 00:09:43,162
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

237
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:45,222
- You danced really well. - She's talented.

238
00:09:45,222 --> 00:09:47,622
- She even made up a few new moves. - I am really surprised.

239
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:48,962
How did she make those moves?

240
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,262
For the first round,

241
00:09:51,522 --> 00:09:53,892
please choose one crystal ball.

242
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:58,332
We've prepared games according to the song titles attached to them.

243
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:00,562
(For the 1st round, the teams should play 3 games with the song titles.)

244
00:10:00,562 --> 00:10:03,462
Never pick "Road Fighter". Jong Kook will crush us.

245
00:10:03,722 --> 00:10:05,292
(Is Jong Kook really a road fighter?)

246
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:07,422
- "Road Fighter"? - We must choose it.

247
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:10,162
- Haven't you decided yet? - It must be a game for couples.

248
00:10:10,422 --> 00:10:11,862
Shall we choose "Couple"?

249
00:10:12,092 --> 00:10:14,292
- Let's choose "Couple". - Okay. We'll choose "Couple".

250
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:16,992
- Gosh. - "Limbo with My Lady"?

251
00:10:17,592 --> 00:10:19,092
For this game,

252
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:22,592
each team must play the limbo game in turn.

253
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,832
The team which passes the lower bar without touching it will win.

254
00:10:26,832 --> 00:10:29,022
- All right, Jong Kook. Let's go. - Good luck.

255
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:34,062
(Jong Kook and Seul Hye will play as a pair this time.)

256
00:10:34,462 --> 00:10:36,162
- You will play first. - Here it is.

257
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:37,762
- Stop pushing others to play first. - Lower the bar.

258
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:39,592
(Jae Jin seems as fit as Jong Kook.)

259
00:10:39,592 --> 00:10:40,662
- Is it okay now? - Yes. Lower it.

260
00:10:40,662 --> 00:10:41,832
Go, Jong Kook.

261
00:10:41,832 --> 00:10:43,092
- That looks great. - Just once, please.

262
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:44,992
- We finally miss Gary now. - Yes, we really do.

263
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:46,562
You're right. Gary's really good at this kind of games.

264
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,922
(We miss you. How are you doing, Gary?)

265
00:10:48,922 --> 00:10:50,222
Stretch your legs. That's it.

266
00:10:50,222 --> 00:10:52,062
- There you go. - Get lower, Jong Kook.

267
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:53,562
You need to stick together for a good result.

268
00:10:53,562 --> 00:10:55,022
Let Seul Hye to pass under the bar first.

269
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,222
- That looks good. - There you go.

270
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,562
- Nice. - Watch out for your microphone.

271
00:10:58,662 --> 00:10:59,992
- He's really steady. - They are amazing.

272
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:00,992
- Mind your head. - You're doing great.

273
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:03,262
(What a great pair they are!)

274
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:06,092
- They succeeded. - Just a little more.

275
00:11:06,592 --> 00:11:07,722
- They passed. - Yes.

276
00:11:07,722 --> 00:11:09,322
(They succeed flawlessly.)

277
00:11:09,322 --> 00:11:11,562
- Success. - Yes!

278
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:15,022
- Jong Kook, that was great. - Did you see that?

279
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:17,392
Did you see Seul Hye slipping her head under the bar?

280
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:19,092
- It looked like a movie. - It really did.

281
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:21,662
That was like a scene from a romance movie.

282
00:11:21,992 --> 00:11:23,792
(It's Jae Jin and Ji Hyo's turn.)

283
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:24,922
Please excuse me.

284
00:11:24,922 --> 00:11:26,622
Look how gentle Jae Jin is.

285
00:11:26,622 --> 00:11:28,292
- Yes, He's really gentle. - All right.

286
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:29,922
It seems really tough.

287
00:11:30,092 --> 00:11:31,192
(The height of the bar is 70 cm.)

288
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:33,792
- He let her head slip under first. - Jae Jin, tuck your head down.

289
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:36,322
You must tuck your head down to pass.

290
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,592
Wait.

291
00:11:38,522 --> 00:11:39,692
Excuse me. Just a moment.

292
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:42,092
- Well, that's a fail. - What was that?

293
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:44,222
- What are you doing? - Did he just dump her?

294
00:11:44,222 --> 00:11:46,322
- You dumped her! - You threw her on the ground.

295
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:48,992
- That's a fail, indeed. - That must be a fail.

296
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:51,092
- What did you just do? - You dumped her.

297
00:11:51,092 --> 00:11:52,262
Are you all right?

298
00:11:52,262 --> 00:11:53,862
Nobody will excuse you if you do this.

299
00:11:53,862 --> 00:11:55,262
- Gosh. - What was that?

300
00:11:55,262 --> 00:11:56,692
That was rude.

301
00:11:56,862 --> 00:11:58,922
- Wasn't it? - That was so rude.

302
00:11:59,522 --> 00:12:01,262
(Jae Jin and Ji Hyo give the second try.)

303
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,562
Saying "excuse me" won't make people feel better.

304
00:12:03,562 --> 00:12:04,692
Step back if you think you wouldn't make it.

305
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:07,192
Wait. Isn't that too far from the bar?

306
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:09,062
Step a bit closer.

307
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:11,162
You can't hold her forever. Hurry up.

308
00:12:11,662 --> 00:12:13,562
Now, I see why you argue often.

309
00:12:13,562 --> 00:12:15,562
(They just can't agree on anything.)

310
00:12:15,992 --> 00:12:17,022
(Slipping)

311
00:12:17,222 --> 00:12:19,662
- Wow. That was good. - No. Mind your head.

312
00:12:19,662 --> 00:12:20,662
(It seems they can pass without a problem.)

313
00:12:21,862 --> 00:12:23,092
(Jae Jin advances cautiously.)

314
00:12:23,092 --> 00:12:25,092
- Mind your head. Good. - Nice.

315
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:26,562
All right. Just a few steps more.

316
00:12:26,562 --> 00:12:28,562
- Be careful. - Be steady. Nice.

317
00:12:28,562 --> 00:12:29,862
- You did it. - Yes.

318
00:12:29,862 --> 00:12:33,322
(Jae Jin and Ji Hyo succeed.)

319
00:12:33,622 --> 00:12:35,422
Gosh. I have a cramp.

320
00:12:35,992 --> 00:12:37,522
(Did I play to get this muscle cramp?)

321
00:12:37,522 --> 00:12:38,762
- Gosh. - Are you all right?

322
00:12:38,962 --> 00:12:40,062
Gosh. I have a cramp.

323
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:42,222
- Good work. - It hurts.

324
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,762
Jong Kook. How about this?

325
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:47,362
- Lift Seul Hye like this... - Don't worry. I'll handle it.

326
00:12:47,362 --> 00:12:48,992
and shove her in like this.

327
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:51,992
- Come on, Jong Kook. - How about this?

328
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:53,522
- Get out. - Jong Kook.

329
00:12:54,092 --> 00:12:55,992
You can throw her to the other side first.

330
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,822
(You too get out.)

331
00:12:57,822 --> 00:13:00,292
Jong Kook. It'd be much easier if you dig a hole underneath.

332
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:01,962
Everyone should get back to your seat.

333
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:04,222
- That's really low. - He can do it.

334
00:13:05,062 --> 00:13:06,192
Are you taking off your shoes for this?

335
00:13:06,392 --> 00:13:08,222
(Jong Kook will do anything to pass under the bar.)

336
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:09,962
Jong Kook is serious about this.

337
00:13:09,962 --> 00:13:11,492
I'm sure he can do it.

338
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:12,922
(Even just crawling under the bar seems difficult.)

339
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:14,262
- Can he do it? - That is really low.

340
00:13:14,262 --> 00:13:15,522
What's the height of the bar? Is it 65cm?

341
00:13:16,022 --> 00:13:18,092
- I'm not sure. - Jong Kook. Just a bit more.

342
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:20,562
Tuck your head down. Just a bit.

343
00:13:20,662 --> 00:13:22,062
- They are amazing. - How can they do that?

344
00:13:22,962 --> 00:13:24,092
You're good. Just keep going.

345
00:13:24,092 --> 00:13:25,192
- Good. - Just a little more to go.

346
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:26,522
- Keep your posture. - You're really close.

347
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:28,162
- That's amazing. - You're almost done.

348
00:13:28,162 --> 00:13:30,062
- Yes. We did it. - Slip her to the other side.

349
00:13:30,222 --> 00:13:31,362
- We did it. - Yes.

350
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:35,092
(Jong Kook and Seul Hye succeed.)

351
00:13:35,092 --> 00:13:36,722
- That was amazing. - You're really good.

352
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:40,192
(Did you see them? That's how you play the limbo.)

353
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:41,862
- Good job. - Jong Kook is still amazing.

354
00:13:42,092 --> 00:13:43,722
- Good job. - I'd never be able to do it myself.

355
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,092
(Jae Jin did his best, but...)

356
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:47,022
- Did you see that? - Only you can do that, Jong Kook.

357
00:13:47,022 --> 00:13:48,762
- Only Jong Kook can do it. - That was amazing.

358
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:50,092
I can't even do it by myself.

359
00:13:50,522 --> 00:13:51,822
It's over.

360
00:13:51,962 --> 00:13:53,292
Shall I rip your name tag off?

361
00:13:53,592 --> 00:13:54,592
It may touch the bar.

362
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:59,592
(What is he doing? Is he the food thief?)

363
00:13:59,592 --> 00:14:01,322
That's your mission, isn't it?

364
00:14:01,462 --> 00:14:03,192
- Are you the food thief? - No, I'm not.

365
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:04,892
- Isn't this your hidden mission? - I just wanted to help you.

366
00:14:04,892 --> 00:14:06,022
- I thought... - Why would you try to take it off?

367
00:14:06,162 --> 00:14:07,922
- Are you on your mission? - No, I really want to help him.

368
00:14:07,922 --> 00:14:09,192
- I know you are the food thief. - Hey.

369
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:10,492
- I'm not the food thief! - You're doing your mission, right?

370
00:14:10,492 --> 00:14:12,222
Since when did you care about our team?

371
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:14,292
- The name tag may touch the bar. - Does it matter?

372
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:15,862
It does. I really wanted to help you.

373
00:14:15,862 --> 00:14:17,862
- Are you on a mission? - No, I'm not. Really.

374
00:14:18,222 --> 00:14:19,362
They can't succeed.

375
00:14:19,762 --> 00:14:21,862
- The height of the bar is 65cm. - No one can do it.

376
00:14:22,592 --> 00:14:25,592
(I don't think I can do this.)

377
00:14:25,592 --> 00:14:27,622
Can we swap?

378
00:14:27,962 --> 00:14:28,962
(What did you just say?)

379
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:30,092
Do you want me to switch the side?

380
00:14:30,092 --> 00:14:31,792
- Like this? - No, I mean...

381
00:14:32,022 --> 00:14:33,062
can you lift me up instead?

382
00:14:33,062 --> 00:14:36,922
(Please. My cramped muscle still hurts.)

383
00:14:37,222 --> 00:14:38,462
- He... - Just kidding.

384
00:14:38,592 --> 00:14:40,692
He wants me to lift him up and do the limbo.

385
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:42,862
Are you serious, Jae Jin?

386
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:44,992
Let's do this.

387
00:14:45,222 --> 00:14:48,162
(Jae Jin lifts Ji Hyo in his arms.)

388
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:50,322
- Jae Jin is good. - Can they make it?

389
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:52,292
- No. That's not good. - Be careful with your name tag.

390
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,062
Mind your head. Your head will hit the bar.

391
00:14:54,062 --> 00:14:56,062
- He did it. - They are almost done.

392
00:14:56,062 --> 00:15:00,492
(If he fails to pass under the bar, they will lose the game.)

393
00:15:01,862 --> 00:15:03,492
(Can he really make it?)

394
00:15:04,662 --> 00:15:06,762
- Slow down, Jae Jin. - Don't rush. Walk slowly.

395
00:15:06,762 --> 00:15:07,922
- Just move your feet. - Slowly, Jae Jin.

396
00:15:07,922 --> 00:15:08,962
- He will knock the bar over. - No.

397
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:13,162
- No. - Yes!

398
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,222
That's why I wanted to take your name tag off. Can you see it now?

399
00:15:15,722 --> 00:15:18,492
(How did Jong Kook and Seul Hye do this?)

400
00:15:18,492 --> 00:15:19,862
- That was really close. - We won.

401
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:21,762
- I thought he would succeed. - I thought so, too.

402
00:15:21,762 --> 00:15:23,292
- They almost succeeded. - Where are you?

403
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,662
Come out, Jae Duck.

404
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:26,592
- In my opinion... - Jae Duck, come out.

405
00:15:26,862 --> 00:15:29,022
Let's play "The Way This Guy Lives" this time.

406
00:15:30,822 --> 00:15:32,292
That's right. You must understand...

407
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:35,022
- "Speed Quiz with a Mouth Gag". - What is a mouth gag?

408
00:15:35,022 --> 00:15:36,962
All right. For this mission,

409
00:15:36,962 --> 00:15:40,422
one of your team members must wear a mouth gag fashionably...

410
00:15:40,662 --> 00:15:43,292
and explain the word in the card to the team mates.

411
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:47,392
Other team members must guess the answer in turn.

412
00:15:48,162 --> 00:15:49,992
All right. The topic is "Classic Folktales from Around the World."

413
00:15:50,662 --> 00:15:52,692
All right, let's begin. Who will wear the mouth gag?

414
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:56,392
(Everybody picks Su Won.)

415
00:15:56,392 --> 00:15:57,862
Goodness.

416
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,392
All right. Let's sit.

417
00:15:59,862 --> 00:16:01,692
- Don't look back. - Yes. We mustn't look back.

418
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:03,592
Ready, set...

419
00:16:04,822 --> 00:16:06,592
("Thumbelina")

420
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:11,362
- This. - Number one?

421
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:12,992
- No. What is this? - It's a thumb.

422
00:16:12,992 --> 00:16:14,792
- It's a thumb. - You know...

423
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:16,792
"Thumbelina".

424
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:19,292
Hurry up. Speak faster.

425
00:16:19,462 --> 00:16:22,862
- One's nose grows like this. - "Pinocchio".

426
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:23,892
- "Pinocchio". - That's right.

427
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:26,792
This person is naked. Completely naked.

428
00:16:26,892 --> 00:16:28,192
- This person wears nothing. - "The Little Mermaid"?

429
00:16:28,692 --> 00:16:30,262
- "The Emperor's New Clothes". - "The Emperor's New Clothes".

430
00:16:30,262 --> 00:16:31,262
Okay.

431
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,392
Pass.

432
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,462
This one wears a scarf.

433
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,092
- A scarf? - "Rapunzel"?

434
00:16:37,722 --> 00:16:39,462
- Isn't it "Rapunzel"? - Frilled lizard?

435
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,062
- A wolf in the story... - I get it.

436
00:16:41,422 --> 00:16:43,192
"Little Red Riding Hood Cha Cha".

437
00:16:43,192 --> 00:16:44,222
No, it's not.

438
00:16:45,062 --> 00:16:46,092
(His action doesn't make any sense.)

439
00:16:46,492 --> 00:16:48,262
- Pass. Just pass. - All right. Pass.

440
00:16:48,492 --> 00:16:50,092
This character works really hard.

441
00:16:50,692 --> 00:16:52,262
- A hardworking one? - Yes.

442
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,862
- Is it "Kongji and Patji"? - No.

443
00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:55,892
- Do you mean "Shim Chung"? - They are really tiny.

444
00:16:55,892 --> 00:16:57,192
- "Jack and the Beanstalk". - No. I mean...

445
00:16:57,562 --> 00:16:59,492
- Is it over already? - What's the answer?

446
00:16:59,492 --> 00:17:00,592
It's "The Ant and the Grasshopper".

447
00:17:00,592 --> 00:17:02,762
(My goodness.)

448
00:17:02,762 --> 00:17:03,962
- "The Ant and the Grasshopper"? - You said the character works hard.

449
00:17:03,962 --> 00:17:05,092
- What's wrong with you? - It didn't make any sense.

450
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:06,392
Why didn't you tell us that the characters are insects?

451
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,792
- You should've have said that. - What's his problem?

452
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:10,062
We thought the character was human.

453
00:17:10,492 --> 00:17:12,032
He's really bad at explaining things.

454
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,822
- My goodness. - He's a terrible at this.

455
00:17:13,822 --> 00:17:16,222
I thought the answer was "Cinderella".

456
00:17:16,222 --> 00:17:18,762
- Take it easy. - Kwang Soo. Will you explain?

457
00:17:18,762 --> 00:17:20,092
Explain well, Kwang Soo.

458
00:17:20,092 --> 00:17:21,422
It's more fun if he's bad at this, though.

459
00:17:21,422 --> 00:17:23,422
(Here comes Kwang Soo, the mouth gag expert.)

460
00:17:23,822 --> 00:17:25,922
Don't worry. He'll do it badly. Kwang Soo is the food thief.

461
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:28,422
- No. We're not sure yet. - Why not?

462
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,032
Su Won was terrible, too.

463
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,162
No way. He did his best.

464
00:17:32,162 --> 00:17:34,092
(I tried my best. I'm not the food thief.)

465
00:17:34,092 --> 00:17:36,262
I never thought that you'd be that bad.

466
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:39,592
- Ready, set... - Tell what animal it is first.

467
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,422
(Kwang Soo is ready with his opened mouth.)

468
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:45,192
("The Good Brothers")

469
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,822
(What is that?)

470
00:17:47,822 --> 00:17:48,922
Hurry up, Kwang Soo.

471
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:51,562
- What are you doing? - Is it "Scarecrow"?

472
00:17:52,092 --> 00:17:53,722
(What on earth are you doing?)

473
00:17:53,992 --> 00:17:55,562
There he goes again.

474
00:17:55,862 --> 00:17:57,062
I'm sure that he's the food thief.

475
00:17:57,422 --> 00:17:59,462
- He must be the food thief. - What is that?

476
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:01,362
- "Alice in Wonderland"? - Pass.

477
00:18:01,362 --> 00:18:03,762
- That was really strange. - The topic is fairly tales.

478
00:18:03,762 --> 00:18:04,992
(With a mouth gag, everyone's a food thief.)

479
00:18:05,692 --> 00:18:06,722
(My gosh.)

480
00:18:06,722 --> 00:18:07,762
("The Magpie Who Returned the Favor")

481
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:10,622
- It's a magpie something. - There's a thing like that?

482
00:18:10,862 --> 00:18:12,492
- What are you doing? - What is it?

483
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:15,162
My leg is broken. Wait, that's not how it goes.

484
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:17,692
- "Heungbu and Nolbu"? - What is this?

485
00:18:17,862 --> 00:18:19,092
That's not the correct title.

486
00:18:19,422 --> 00:18:21,162
You can't pass this one.

487
00:18:21,222 --> 00:18:22,792
Who's the woman that goes, "Of course"?

488
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:24,162
- What? - You know what I mean.

489
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:25,862
- Eun Hye? - It returned the favor.

490
00:18:25,892 --> 00:18:27,662
"The Magpie Who Returned the Favor".

491
00:18:27,662 --> 00:18:29,422
You're so dumb.

492
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:31,892
A naked person taking a bath and a lumberjack.

493
00:18:31,892 --> 00:18:33,592
"A Fairy and a Woodcutter".

494
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:36,222
- "A Fairy and a Woodcutter". - "A Fairy and a Woodcutter".

495
00:18:36,892 --> 00:18:38,392
- Time's up. - What are you doing?

496
00:18:38,392 --> 00:18:41,362
- What's this? - "Puss in Boots".

497
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:42,762
- What is that? - Gosh.

498
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,092
- What is that? - Gosh.

499
00:18:45,462 --> 00:18:47,662
How do you not know "The Magpie Who Returned the Favor"?

500
00:18:47,662 --> 00:18:49,722
Do you know what "The Good Brothers" is then?

501
00:18:49,722 --> 00:18:51,722
Of course, I do.

502
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:54,662
- Is it a real thing? - Have you not heard of it?

503
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:55,692
How do you not know this story?

504
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:57,922
I've heard of the Wright brothers, but not "The Good Brothers".

505
00:18:58,222 --> 00:18:59,822
How can you not know this?

506
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:01,922
Was this how he described "The Good Brothers"?

507
00:19:02,092 --> 00:19:04,362
I figured good brothers put their arms around each other's shoulders.

508
00:19:04,362 --> 00:19:07,292
It's the story about a magpie ringing a bell with its head.

509
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:09,422
- Oh, is that the story? - That's the one.

510
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:11,322
What's the story about a gourd seed?

511
00:19:11,422 --> 00:19:13,392
That's "Heungbu and Nolbu".

512
00:19:13,822 --> 00:19:15,362
Oh, that was a swallow.

513
00:19:15,692 --> 00:19:17,192
Get it together.

514
00:19:17,462 --> 00:19:20,492
I thought Su Won was bad, but you're on a whole new level.

515
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:22,092
I'm sorry, Su Won.

516
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:23,262
I really didn't know.

517
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,692
- Su Won got three right. - He did?

518
00:19:25,722 --> 00:19:28,762
- It was really hard. - What on earth was that?

519
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:30,592
Get the next game started already.

520
00:19:31,062 --> 00:19:33,692
Let's get on with "Road Fighter".

521
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:35,462
Let's get on with "Road Fighter".

522
00:19:36,062 --> 00:19:38,662
("Road Fighter")

523
00:19:38,662 --> 00:19:40,922
("Pillow Fight")

524
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,722
We'll be able to tell who the food thief is from this game.

525
00:19:43,962 --> 00:19:47,192
(The person to knock the opponent off first with a pillow wins.)

526
00:19:47,192 --> 00:19:48,692
- You should go. - You want me to do an all-kill?

527
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:50,822
- You should go up. - If you lose this one...

528
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,092
- We have our eyes on you. - I can do good.

529
00:19:52,092 --> 00:19:54,762
- Only the food thief would lose. - Let's go.

530
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:57,992
Prove us wrong, Kwang Soo.

531
00:19:58,292 --> 00:19:59,992
- Let's go. - I can do this.

532
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:01,322
- Let's go. - I'm watching you.

533
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:03,422
- I can do well. - This is your last chance.

534
00:20:03,532 --> 00:20:05,162
- I can do good. - Hold onto the zipper.

535
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,722
They say Kwang Soo is stronger than he looks.

536
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:08,762
- He is strong. - You should go first.

537
00:20:08,762 --> 00:20:10,162
I think you should go first.

538
00:20:10,162 --> 00:20:11,262
(The leader of Sechs Kies, Ji Won, goes up against Kwang Soo.)

539
00:20:11,262 --> 00:20:13,422
Watch Kwang Soo carefully.

540
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,722
- He's acting like he's not. - He's trying to be smart with us.

541
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:16,722
(Kwang Soo versus Ji Won)

542
00:20:16,722 --> 00:20:17,962
They get one pillow each.

543
00:20:19,262 --> 00:20:21,222
- Ready, - Wait.

544
00:20:21,222 --> 00:20:23,092
- set... - Hold on.

545
00:20:23,762 --> 00:20:25,862
(He steps down before the game even starts.)

546
00:20:25,862 --> 00:20:27,362
- We didn't start yet, right? - Are you forfeiting?

547
00:20:27,362 --> 00:20:29,222
- We didn't start yet. - Why can't he keep his balance?

548
00:20:29,222 --> 00:20:30,962
He's acting so strange.

549
00:20:30,962 --> 00:20:32,762
Wait! Is he allowed to do that?

550
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:34,532
My legs are just weak.

551
00:20:34,822 --> 00:20:36,962
- Ready... - Why would a right-handed person...

552
00:20:36,962 --> 00:20:38,692
stand that way, Stupid?

553
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:40,292
(Did you call me stupid?)

554
00:20:40,562 --> 00:20:43,662
Please don't verbally harass him.

555
00:20:44,262 --> 00:20:46,092
- Isn't that a bit harsh? - It was.

556
00:20:46,092 --> 00:20:47,592
They're supposed to cheer for me.

557
00:20:47,722 --> 00:20:49,662
I was just...

558
00:20:49,662 --> 00:20:51,692
trying to maximize my reach.

559
00:20:51,692 --> 00:20:53,362
I had a plan.

560
00:20:53,362 --> 00:20:54,992
- Do as you wish. - Ready,

561
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:57,092
set, go.

562
00:20:59,262 --> 00:21:00,992
(They're already weak from the start.)

563
00:21:01,262 --> 00:21:02,862
Let's see how he does.

564
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,322
(Why you little...)

565
00:21:04,592 --> 00:21:06,192
(Kwang Soo flinches.)

566
00:21:06,862 --> 00:21:08,532
- Hit him. - Just hit him.

567
00:21:08,822 --> 00:21:09,962
(He throws a swing.)

568
00:21:10,622 --> 00:21:11,662
Duck.

569
00:21:11,662 --> 00:21:13,562
(He throws a big swing after faking his flinch.)

570
00:21:13,922 --> 00:21:15,722
(Ji Won swings.)

571
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:16,862
(How dare you hit me first?)

572
00:21:16,862 --> 00:21:18,322
(How dare you hit me first?)

573
00:21:18,822 --> 00:21:20,822
(I'm counting on you, my servant.)

574
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,992
Duck!

575
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:27,222
(I took a step back to take two steps further.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

576
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,422
(Ji Won hits himself.)

577
00:21:31,322 --> 00:21:35,922
(He loses balance and hits himself in the face.)

578
00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:41,622
(Thanks to Ji Won's self-destruction, Kwang Soo wins.)

579
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:43,362
I told you, I'm not a food thief.

580
00:21:43,562 --> 00:21:44,622
See that?

581
00:21:44,622 --> 00:21:45,862
(My body's not like how it used to be.)

582
00:21:45,862 --> 00:21:47,622
I was meaning to do a counter attack.

583
00:21:47,722 --> 00:21:48,992
(Thanks for that.)

584
00:21:48,992 --> 00:21:51,162
Ji Won looked so cool when he dodged.

585
00:21:51,862 --> 00:21:54,222
- I thought I lost for a second. - That was a good dodge.

586
00:21:54,292 --> 00:21:56,522
- Why did he suddenly fall down? - He's must be the food thief.

587
00:21:56,522 --> 00:21:58,292
He must be.

588
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:00,522
- If not, why did he fall? - Because I was strong.

589
00:22:00,592 --> 00:22:02,592
- He's acting strange. - I don't understand.

590
00:22:02,662 --> 00:22:04,162
Su Won is up next.

591
00:22:04,262 --> 00:22:07,322
- Ready, set, go! - Looking good.

592
00:22:07,562 --> 00:22:10,192
(Input command: Move forward and attack.)

593
00:22:10,192 --> 00:22:12,062
- Just swing it. - He's looking at me funny.

594
00:22:12,092 --> 00:22:13,962
- Hit him. - He's tall, too.

595
00:22:13,962 --> 00:22:15,362
He sure is tall.

596
00:22:16,392 --> 00:22:17,692
Nice.

597
00:22:17,692 --> 00:22:22,862
(Su Won is in attack mode.)

598
00:22:22,862 --> 00:22:24,222
What was that?

599
00:22:24,222 --> 00:22:26,992
(Replay)

600
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:29,062
(Where are you going?)

601
00:22:29,692 --> 00:22:32,392
- How many times did he hit you? - Can we go again?

602
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:34,092
Let me go against him one more time.

603
00:22:34,462 --> 00:22:37,392
I want to get him back.

604
00:22:38,462 --> 00:22:40,662
I didn't win this one.

605
00:22:40,662 --> 00:22:42,092
- It's not done yet. - That's enough.

606
00:22:42,092 --> 00:22:44,092
(He got slapped by a robot with a pillow.)

607
00:22:44,092 --> 00:22:45,162
You did good.

608
00:22:45,162 --> 00:22:46,862
- Kwang Soo's good. - It feels like...

609
00:22:46,862 --> 00:22:48,622
Jae Jin is always the one cleaning up their mess.

610
00:22:48,762 --> 00:22:49,792
Oh, my back.

611
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:52,962
If you lose this one, consider our friendship over.

612
00:22:53,022 --> 00:22:55,492
- Ready... - You can beat them all.

613
00:22:55,492 --> 00:22:56,522
What are you doing?

614
00:22:56,922 --> 00:22:58,192
Why would you...

615
00:22:58,862 --> 00:23:01,792
Why would you do that? It's just a game.

616
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:03,622
That's why your back hurts.

617
00:23:04,262 --> 00:23:05,622
You don't have to do that.

618
00:23:05,822 --> 00:23:07,422
- You'll hurt yourself. - Just play the game.

619
00:23:07,422 --> 00:23:08,892
Take it easy, Jae Jin.

620
00:23:08,892 --> 00:23:10,422
- Don't hurt yourself. - Who made you like this?

621
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,322
Don't get yourself hurt.

622
00:23:13,862 --> 00:23:15,792
- He used to be quick. - Right.

623
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:17,062
Don't say that.

624
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,622
Ready, set, go!

625
00:23:19,622 --> 00:23:21,292
Swing the pillow.

626
00:23:21,292 --> 00:23:22,922
Make him lose his balance.

627
00:23:24,062 --> 00:23:25,192
What are you doing?

628
00:23:27,192 --> 00:23:28,492
- That hurts. - Be careful.

629
00:23:28,562 --> 00:23:31,462
(He hits him numerous times.)

630
00:23:31,722 --> 00:23:34,092
- What are you doing? - What's he trying to do?

631
00:23:34,492 --> 00:23:35,922
(He gets hit again.)

632
00:23:36,662 --> 00:23:38,522
(Jae Jin is about to lose his balance.)

633
00:23:38,662 --> 00:23:40,892
What are you doing?

634
00:23:40,992 --> 00:23:42,392
- What was that? - Come on.

635
00:23:42,392 --> 00:23:44,062
- Are you the food thief? - No.

636
00:23:44,062 --> 00:23:46,362
- No, no. - I didn't even do anything.

637
00:23:46,362 --> 00:23:47,992
He's not very enthusiastic.

638
00:23:47,992 --> 00:23:50,262
- He's the food thief. - Are you?

639
00:23:50,492 --> 00:23:51,492
- No, I'm not. - He's definitely the food thief.

640
00:23:51,492 --> 00:23:53,892
Did you take your jacket off for that?

641
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:59,262
(Jae Jin makes Ji Won curse at him.)

642
00:23:59,262 --> 00:24:00,822
Calm down.

643
00:24:00,822 --> 00:24:03,222
This doesn't make sense unless he's the food thief.

644
00:24:03,462 --> 00:24:06,422
But still, that was a bit harsh.

645
00:24:06,422 --> 00:24:08,692
Team Seul Hye wins!

646
00:24:08,692 --> 00:24:10,592
(Team Seul Hye wins.)

647
00:24:10,592 --> 00:24:12,862
Lady Seul Hye will be awarded with a hint...

648
00:24:12,862 --> 00:24:15,792
- and a Member Swapping Card. - Can we look at the hint as well?

649
00:24:15,792 --> 00:24:18,562
- It's for her only. - Okay.

650
00:24:18,822 --> 00:24:21,092
Does it say who the food thief is?

651
00:24:22,222 --> 00:24:25,022
(The food thief was born in summer.)

652
00:24:25,522 --> 00:24:27,722
Did you see it?

653
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:29,762
- We won. - When's your birthday, Kwang Soo?

654
00:24:29,762 --> 00:24:32,192
- I was born in July. - When's your birthday?

655
00:24:32,192 --> 00:24:34,292
- When's your birthday? - The birthday is the hint.

656
00:24:34,522 --> 00:24:36,592
July, August, August,

657
00:24:36,592 --> 00:24:38,262
- April. - April, and July.

658
00:24:38,822 --> 00:24:40,262
- When's your birthday? - June.

659
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:41,822
- When's your birthday? - It's in July.

660
00:24:41,822 --> 00:24:43,322
- When's your birthday? - July.

661
00:24:43,322 --> 00:24:44,762
- August. - August?

662
00:24:44,892 --> 00:24:46,422
Am I allowed not to use the Swapping Card?

663
00:24:46,422 --> 00:24:47,622
- Of course. - You don't have to.

664
00:24:47,622 --> 00:24:48,692
I won't use it, then.

665
00:24:48,692 --> 00:24:50,062
Good thinking.

666
00:24:50,392 --> 00:24:52,822
- You should save it for later. - That's right.

667
00:24:52,822 --> 00:24:54,222
Keep it until the very last moment.

668
00:24:56,892 --> 00:24:59,292
- Are you all hungry? - Yes.

669
00:24:59,292 --> 00:25:01,522
We're in Icheon, home of delicious rice.

670
00:25:01,522 --> 00:25:03,792
We prepared a table full of food with delicious Icheon rice.

671
00:25:04,722 --> 00:25:06,722
Look at all that.

672
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:09,422
- It's waiting for us. - This is really nice.

673
00:25:09,422 --> 00:25:11,492
The second round of Food Thief Race is called...

674
00:25:11,662 --> 00:25:13,862
"The Servants' Drawings".

675
00:25:14,062 --> 00:25:16,522
- What? - Do you see the rooms behind you?

676
00:25:16,822 --> 00:25:19,722
The five servants will go in each of the rooms...

677
00:25:19,722 --> 00:25:22,792
and when a door opens, the servant has to guess...

678
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:25,522
what the shown drawing is about and redraw it...

679
00:25:25,522 --> 00:25:27,092
to show to the following person.

680
00:25:27,362 --> 00:25:31,322
The winning team will get to enjoy the food we prepared.

681
00:25:32,022 --> 00:25:34,862
The losing team will be given rice only.

682
00:25:34,922 --> 00:25:36,522
With that rice,

683
00:25:37,022 --> 00:25:39,322
you'll go over to the neighboring villages...

684
00:25:39,322 --> 00:25:43,062
and will have to ask the villagers for six kinds of side dishes.

685
00:25:43,492 --> 00:25:45,092
- We have to win. - I don't want to do that.

686
00:25:45,092 --> 00:25:47,162
You will have to ask the villagers for six kinds of side dishes.

687
00:25:47,162 --> 00:25:48,592
I don't eat side dishes.

688
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,892
- I never eat side dishes. - I dip my rice in water.

689
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,422
I don't want side dishes.

690
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:56,762
Please decide on the order of the servants.

691
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:59,592
Jae Jin is really good at drawing. But even then,

692
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:01,022
- there's a time limit. - That's right.

693
00:26:01,022 --> 00:26:02,992
It's not easy to emphasize the characteristics under a time limit.

694
00:26:02,992 --> 00:26:06,422
That's right. You have to draw it quickly and concisely.

695
00:26:06,522 --> 00:26:08,722
It should be in this order.

696
00:26:09,422 --> 00:26:12,222
The start is the most important.

697
00:26:12,222 --> 00:26:13,792
I'll go first, then.

698
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:17,662
(The order of the servants)

699
00:26:17,662 --> 00:26:20,692
The theme of the given words will be about landmarks.

700
00:26:20,692 --> 00:26:22,822
- Ready... - Landmarks?

701
00:26:23,892 --> 00:26:26,062
(The game has started.)

702
00:26:26,592 --> 00:26:28,022
(The first servant has a critical responsibility.)

703
00:26:28,022 --> 00:26:30,392
- One. - Two, three.

704
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,422
- I'm not good at drawing. - Four.

705
00:26:32,662 --> 00:26:33,722
Five.

706
00:26:34,062 --> 00:26:36,422
(Jong Kook shows it to Jae Seok.)

707
00:26:36,422 --> 00:26:37,522
It's a landmark.

708
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:39,662
(Welcome to my artistic world.)

709
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:41,022
It's a landmark.

710
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:44,392
Do you get it?

711
00:26:44,662 --> 00:26:46,922
(What is this drawing?)

712
00:26:46,922 --> 00:26:49,992
It's not in Korea, is it? What is that?

713
00:26:50,892 --> 00:26:52,362
Wait, I didn't get a good look.

714
00:26:53,062 --> 00:26:54,562
I made a mistake.

715
00:26:55,092 --> 00:26:57,562
- I didn't get a good look at it. - Take a look at his drawing.

716
00:26:57,562 --> 00:27:01,162
- Take a look at his drawing. - What is this supposed to be?

717
00:27:01,862 --> 00:27:05,792
One, two, three, four,

718
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,392
- This is a Korean landmark? - Five.

719
00:27:09,822 --> 00:27:11,162
(Take a look at his drawing.)

720
00:27:12,062 --> 00:27:13,992
(There's a tower in the middle of the mountains.)

721
00:27:13,992 --> 00:27:15,892
- Okay. - You have to start drawing now.

722
00:27:17,062 --> 00:27:19,292
- What do you think that is? - I thought it was N Seoul Tower.

723
00:27:19,862 --> 00:27:22,062
It's a tower in the mountains.

724
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,222
(He's feeling artistic.)

725
00:27:25,222 --> 00:27:26,962
Is that a finger?

726
00:27:27,192 --> 00:27:28,262
Oh, gosh.

727
00:27:32,662 --> 00:27:33,862
Is he giving me the middle finger?

728
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:36,462
Gosh.

729
00:27:36,662 --> 00:27:38,092
I'm really sorry about this.

730
00:27:39,562 --> 00:27:41,892
One, two, three.

731
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:43,492
It looks like there's a ring on a finger.

732
00:27:43,892 --> 00:27:47,462
Three, four, five. Time's up.

733
00:27:50,092 --> 00:27:51,092
(Take a look, Lady Seul Hye.)

734
00:27:51,092 --> 00:27:52,322
What on earth is that?

735
00:27:52,562 --> 00:27:54,762
- An alien? - It's a landmark.

736
00:27:54,762 --> 00:27:57,192
- I think I got it. - Really?

737
00:27:58,162 --> 00:27:59,722
This is the hint.

738
00:28:00,092 --> 00:28:01,692
This is the hint.

739
00:28:01,792 --> 00:28:03,392
That's the hint?

740
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:05,422
(It's all up to Seul Hye's imagination now.)

741
00:28:05,422 --> 00:28:06,622
It could be a Korean landmark.

742
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:10,562
Two, three, four, five. Please say the answer.

743
00:28:10,692 --> 00:28:12,622
Is it N Seoul Tower?

744
00:28:13,062 --> 00:28:14,192
(Is it?)

745
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:16,622
N Seoul Tower.

746
00:28:17,892 --> 00:28:18,892
Is it correct?

747
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:20,662
Are you sure?

748
00:28:21,322 --> 00:28:22,762
(Our lady did it.)

749
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:24,462
- Is she correct? - What?

750
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,292
How can she get it right?

751
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:28,822
- How did she know? - How did she?

752
00:28:29,992 --> 00:28:31,222
How did she get it right?

753
00:28:31,222 --> 00:28:33,722
It is N Seoul Tower.

754
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:35,562
- Is this N Seoul Tower? - Yes.

755
00:28:36,692 --> 00:28:39,092
(Great job, Seul Hye.)

756
00:28:40,062 --> 00:28:41,992
- This is ridiculous! - This is!

757
00:28:41,992 --> 00:28:44,092
- I thought you were wrong. - It's unbelievable.

758
00:28:44,192 --> 00:28:45,722
How did you get it correct?

759
00:28:45,992 --> 00:28:47,992
I drew it like this and she got the correct answer.

760
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,262
(How did she think of N Seoul Tower with this drawing?)

761
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,792
I thought it was Kkumdori, the mascot of Daejeon.

762
00:28:53,762 --> 00:28:56,392
I thought it was the statue...

763
00:28:56,762 --> 00:28:58,362
in Brazil.

764
00:28:58,792 --> 00:29:01,092
- She got it correct. - I can't believe it.

765
00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:04,192
Seul Hye, you're incredible.

766
00:29:04,192 --> 00:29:06,322
I don't think you're doing your duty properly.

767
00:29:06,492 --> 00:29:07,992
I'm not the food thief.

768
00:29:07,992 --> 00:29:09,622
How could you help her guess?

769
00:29:10,262 --> 00:29:11,962
She got the other ones correct, too.

770
00:29:11,962 --> 00:29:13,262
(Who could be the food thief?)

771
00:29:14,892 --> 00:29:16,692
It's the second question. Ready,

772
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:17,822
set.

773
00:29:18,492 --> 00:29:20,322
One, two...

774
00:29:20,322 --> 00:29:22,262
(Though Jong Kook described some critical points of Colosseum...)

775
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:24,422
- What on earth did you draw? - It's a landmark.

776
00:29:24,422 --> 00:29:25,962
(Jae Seok, Seok Jin and Kwang Soo ruins the drawings.)

777
00:29:25,962 --> 00:29:28,362
- Remember it's a landmark. - A landmark?

778
00:29:28,762 --> 00:29:29,792
What could it be?

779
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:32,062
(The drawing is no longer that of Colosseum.)

780
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:33,222
What is this? Wait.

781
00:29:33,222 --> 00:29:34,892
(The drawing is no longer that of Colosseum.)

782
00:29:34,892 --> 00:29:37,762
Sorry. This is exactly what Seok Jin drew.

783
00:29:37,762 --> 00:29:38,762
Is it Gwangan Bridge?

784
00:29:38,762 --> 00:29:39,992
(She fails the second question.)

785
00:29:39,992 --> 00:29:40,992
- What is it? - What's that?

786
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,992
- Draw them well. - Look at Seok Jin.

787
00:29:42,992 --> 00:29:45,362
(They're narrowing down the suspects.)

788
00:29:46,162 --> 00:29:47,392
Seok Jin, concentrate.

789
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,322
- We need to get at least two. - Okay.

790
00:29:49,322 --> 00:29:51,192
This is the last question.

791
00:29:51,362 --> 00:29:52,862
We must get the correct answer this time.

792
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:55,262
- Ready. - It's a famous landmark.

793
00:29:55,262 --> 00:29:56,392
It's a landmark.

794
00:29:58,592 --> 00:30:00,162
Oh, this one.

795
00:30:00,862 --> 00:30:01,922
This is the one.

796
00:30:01,992 --> 00:30:04,722
I'll start drawing this one. Wait for a moment.

797
00:30:04,892 --> 00:30:06,692
He thinks we can get the correct answer.

798
00:30:06,692 --> 00:30:07,962
- It must be easy. - It must be famous.

799
00:30:07,962 --> 00:30:09,062
Seok Jin, concentrate.

800
00:30:09,062 --> 00:30:10,592
(The first drawing is important.)

801
00:30:11,362 --> 00:30:12,592
Ready,

802
00:30:12,592 --> 00:30:14,692
(He gets ready.)

803
00:30:14,692 --> 00:30:15,762
Start!

804
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:20,062
Two, three, four...

805
00:30:20,062 --> 00:30:21,262
(What does his drawing look like?)

806
00:30:22,392 --> 00:30:24,392
(Haha is the second runner to get Jong Kook's drawing.)

807
00:30:25,392 --> 00:30:27,692
- What is this? - I see.

808
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,192
- You can figure it out, right? - Wait.

809
00:30:29,192 --> 00:30:30,622
- Think it over. - It's a landmark.

810
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:33,892
I figured it out. You wanted to draw the buildings but they look weird.

811
00:30:33,892 --> 00:30:36,192
You should draw it in the limited time.

812
00:30:36,362 --> 00:30:38,822
- Let's describe it well. - Describe?

813
00:30:39,592 --> 00:30:43,962
(After seeing the buildings and the statue, what will Haha draw?)

814
00:30:44,722 --> 00:30:45,722
Five.

815
00:30:47,022 --> 00:30:48,992
Jae Seok, you know what it is, don't you?

816
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:51,092
I see.

817
00:30:51,692 --> 00:30:52,962
I have to describe it well.

818
00:30:52,962 --> 00:30:54,862
Describe it well. Emphasize the special points.

819
00:30:54,862 --> 00:30:56,722
Do it well.

820
00:30:56,792 --> 00:30:58,422
I should draw it well.

821
00:30:58,422 --> 00:30:59,692
(I trust you, Jae Seok.)

822
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:01,992
- One, two... - All right.

823
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:03,162
(He starts to draw.)

824
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,392
Wait a minute.

825
00:31:04,392 --> 00:31:06,062
(Sung Hoon laughs.)

826
00:31:06,062 --> 00:31:07,362
(What is Jae Seok's drawing like?)

827
00:31:07,362 --> 00:31:09,762
- Wait. - Jae Seok.

828
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:12,222
- Seok Jin. - It's a squid.

829
00:31:12,492 --> 00:31:13,592
It's a squid.

830
00:31:14,062 --> 00:31:15,092
It's a squid.

831
00:31:15,492 --> 00:31:17,462
- What on earth is that? - It's a landmark.

832
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:20,822
You should look at this part. This is the key point.

833
00:31:21,092 --> 00:31:22,192
(It's the Statue of Liberty.)

834
00:31:22,192 --> 00:31:23,862
(But it looks like the statue of a baby octopus.)

835
00:31:23,862 --> 00:31:25,662
Look carefully before you start to draw.

836
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,092
You should not explain it, Jae Seok.

837
00:31:28,892 --> 00:31:30,392
(Observation time is over.)

838
00:31:31,492 --> 00:31:34,892
(The next person is no other than Seok Jin, the terrible artist.)

839
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:37,092
(We're done for once again.)

840
00:31:38,462 --> 00:31:39,492
Five.

841
00:31:40,162 --> 00:31:41,862
(They laugh.)

842
00:31:42,092 --> 00:31:43,522
Now, show it.

843
00:31:43,522 --> 00:31:45,862
Look at this carefully.

844
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,892
What is this?

845
00:31:46,892 --> 00:31:48,062
(What should I look at carefully?)

846
00:31:48,062 --> 00:31:49,092
- What's this? - Look carefully.

847
00:31:49,222 --> 00:31:51,192
This person is...

848
00:31:51,192 --> 00:31:52,522
- Look carefully. - You're not supposed to explain it.

849
00:31:52,522 --> 00:31:54,792
- I know it but I can't explain it. - Look carefully.

850
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:55,792
I...

851
00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:57,822
Pick out the key point!

852
00:31:59,992 --> 00:32:01,822
(We're doomed!)

853
00:32:01,822 --> 00:32:03,062
My goodness.

854
00:32:03,062 --> 00:32:06,092
(Where did we go wrong?)

855
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:08,092
This looks like a dumpling.

856
00:32:09,392 --> 00:32:10,922
- What should I do? - One,

857
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:12,362
two...

858
00:32:12,362 --> 00:32:13,962
(You can do it, Kwang Soo.)

859
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:18,062
Five. Stop. Drop the pen.

860
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:19,092
(It's a disaster.)

861
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:22,192
Is this a landmark?

862
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:25,092
Seul Hye, take it easy and think about it.

863
00:32:25,622 --> 00:32:26,622
Be quiet.

864
00:32:26,622 --> 00:32:29,522
(The only thing you can guess is that someone is holding something.)

865
00:32:29,522 --> 00:32:33,092
(Will Seul Hye be able to work her magic again?)

866
00:32:33,092 --> 00:32:34,192
The Statue of Liberty?

867
00:32:34,392 --> 00:32:35,492
The Statue of Liberty?

868
00:32:35,762 --> 00:32:37,392
(Okay)

869
00:32:37,492 --> 00:32:39,422
Is the answer the Statue of Liberty?

870
00:32:39,422 --> 00:32:42,462
(It's the correct answer.)

871
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:43,462
(Seul Hye is the legend of interpreting drawings.)

872
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,022
This is unbelievable.

873
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:50,462
(It's chaos.)

874
00:32:52,692 --> 00:32:53,692
- It's correct. - There you go.

875
00:32:53,692 --> 00:32:54,892
(They are shocked at her imagination.)

876
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:56,192
How did she get the correct answer?

877
00:32:56,492 --> 00:32:58,892
- She did it. - Awesome.

878
00:32:58,992 --> 00:32:59,992
It's the correct answer.

879
00:32:59,992 --> 00:33:03,462
(How could she think of the Statue of Liberty out of this?)

880
00:33:03,892 --> 00:33:05,622
- This is ridiculous. - Incredible.

881
00:33:05,622 --> 00:33:06,862
(I'm this kind of a girl.)

882
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:08,762
(Ji Hyo is puzzled.)

883
00:33:09,962 --> 00:33:11,892
How did you figure it out with this?

884
00:33:11,892 --> 00:33:12,892
(Escaping the hazard of Seok Jin,)

885
00:33:12,892 --> 00:33:16,722
(Seul Hye worked it out with her imagination.)

886
00:33:17,592 --> 00:33:19,062
The first drawing is the most important.

887
00:33:19,592 --> 00:33:22,622
It's for sure. Don't try to draw it well.

888
00:33:22,622 --> 00:33:23,862
Just describe the key points.

889
00:33:23,862 --> 00:33:25,192
(This is Team Ji Hyo's plan.)

890
00:33:25,892 --> 00:33:28,322
The key word for Sechs Kies is...

891
00:33:28,322 --> 00:33:29,992
"occupation".

892
00:33:30,222 --> 00:33:31,962
This must be difficult.

893
00:33:32,492 --> 00:33:33,992
Leave people out of the drawings.

894
00:33:33,992 --> 00:33:35,092
Ready,

895
00:33:35,092 --> 00:33:36,692
- Don't draw people. - set...

896
00:33:36,692 --> 00:33:38,692
Draw something they use.

897
00:33:39,922 --> 00:33:41,392
- It can be easier. - You're right.

898
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:43,062
It can be easy.

899
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,062
- This can be easier. - You can...

900
00:33:45,592 --> 00:33:48,092
Jae Jin is so good at drawing pictures.

901
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:51,462
I'm doomed.

902
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:55,892
I can think of something I would draw.

903
00:33:55,892 --> 00:33:57,222
(Maybe my brain is broken.)

904
00:33:57,362 --> 00:33:58,592
Something like this?

905
00:33:59,392 --> 00:34:00,792
- Well... - How can I describe it?

906
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:03,562
- Start drawing. - Draw it simple.

907
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,162
- Ready... - Wait, wait.

908
00:34:05,162 --> 00:34:06,932
I have no idea.

909
00:34:08,292 --> 00:34:10,492
- Just point out what's important. - I want to draw it but...

910
00:34:10,892 --> 00:34:12,432
- Three. - No, wait. What are you doing?

911
00:34:12,432 --> 00:34:13,432
Wait a moment, please.

912
00:34:13,432 --> 00:34:14,862
It takes too long.

913
00:34:15,432 --> 00:34:16,892
(His brain stops temporarily.)

914
00:34:16,892 --> 00:34:18,392
What are you doing, Jae Jin?

915
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:20,062
Let's do it quickly.

916
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:22,562
It's not good to draw too much.

917
00:34:23,592 --> 00:34:25,092
(I have to remain calm to survive.)

918
00:34:25,092 --> 00:34:26,562
- Okay. - One. Start!

919
00:34:27,722 --> 00:34:29,762
- Okay. - This is terrible.

920
00:34:30,262 --> 00:34:32,862
(What does Jae Jin think a model's key points are?)

921
00:34:33,932 --> 00:34:35,392
(Jong Kook laughs.)

922
00:34:35,692 --> 00:34:36,722
Five.

923
00:34:36,722 --> 00:34:37,762
(What should I do?)

924
00:34:40,992 --> 00:34:43,262
You ruined it, didn't you? What is it?

925
00:34:43,892 --> 00:34:45,222
This is it.

926
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,392
(It's just a person.)

927
00:34:48,522 --> 00:34:49,622
(What is this unidentified creature?)

928
00:34:49,622 --> 00:34:51,362
- It's an occupation. - Gosh.

929
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:52,892
- It's an occupation. - Wait.

930
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:55,792
You have to make up this occupation.

931
00:34:55,792 --> 00:34:56,992
I know.

932
00:34:56,992 --> 00:34:58,862
(It's just a naked body. How can he find it out?)

933
00:34:59,462 --> 00:35:01,432
Does he have to make up that occupation?

934
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:03,492
How could he draw only a person?

935
00:35:04,322 --> 00:35:06,592
We should've not placed Jae Jin first.

936
00:35:06,592 --> 00:35:09,092
(The first runner ruined everything.)

937
00:35:09,592 --> 00:35:11,092
I'll draw it the same anyway.

938
00:35:11,432 --> 00:35:12,462
I'll start.

939
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:14,692
(He hesitates.)

940
00:35:14,692 --> 00:35:16,892
One, two...

941
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:19,692
(Haha bursts into laughter.)

942
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:21,392
What is this?

943
00:35:21,722 --> 00:35:23,362
(Now, it is tossed to Sung Hoon.)

944
00:35:23,362 --> 00:35:24,692
Let me see.

945
00:35:25,222 --> 00:35:26,562
- What is it? - What is this?

946
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,592
Gosh, what did you do?

947
00:35:29,362 --> 00:35:30,862
- Well... - What does it mean?

948
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,462
- Jae Jin drew it like this. - Two, three...

949
00:35:33,062 --> 00:35:35,892
- Ji Won has to guess it. - What could it be?

950
00:35:35,892 --> 00:35:37,692
- Goodness, what can it be? - This is impossible.

951
00:35:37,692 --> 00:35:39,892
It's not my fault. I copied what he drew.

952
00:35:39,892 --> 00:35:40,892
Is this an occupation?

953
00:35:40,892 --> 00:35:41,892
What is it?

954
00:35:42,692 --> 00:35:43,692
Poor you.

955
00:35:43,692 --> 00:35:45,592
(How did a model become this skinny?)

956
00:35:45,592 --> 00:35:47,322
- How can you figure it out? - Four,

957
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:49,592
five.

958
00:35:49,592 --> 00:35:50,892
He's poor at drawing, too.

959
00:35:50,892 --> 00:35:52,062
(It'll be tossed to the last runner, Ji Won.)

960
00:35:52,062 --> 00:35:53,362
I exactly copied it.

961
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:56,162
(What does his exact copy look like?)

962
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:02,092
My goodness. It's hard to figure it out.

963
00:36:02,322 --> 00:36:03,692
- Did you say you copied it? - Yes.

964
00:36:04,392 --> 00:36:06,292
Is he a scarecrow or what?

965
00:36:06,492 --> 00:36:08,592
(This is the butterfly effect caused by Jae Jin.)

966
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:13,092
(Ji Won is creating its job with his imagination.)

967
00:36:13,092 --> 00:36:15,432
Four, five. Stop.

968
00:36:15,432 --> 00:36:16,892
Ji Won can't draw.

969
00:36:16,892 --> 00:36:18,962
It has changed completely.

970
00:36:21,792 --> 00:36:23,992
(He added something near the left hand.)

971
00:36:26,222 --> 00:36:28,092
Ji Won made this up just now.

972
00:36:28,762 --> 00:36:30,092
This is totally different.

973
00:36:30,692 --> 00:36:33,392
(Can Ji Hyo also work a miracle with her imagination?)

974
00:36:34,322 --> 00:36:35,432
An athlete.

975
00:36:35,432 --> 00:36:38,062
(It's not correct.)

976
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:39,162
What did you think it was?

977
00:36:39,362 --> 00:36:40,492
I thought it was a shot putter.

978
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,192
(This is my fault.)

979
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:45,092
Was it a model? It was difficult.

980
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:48,892
- Jae Jin, let me see yours. - You should draw a runway.

981
00:36:49,092 --> 00:36:50,362
Su Won, look at that.

982
00:36:51,432 --> 00:36:53,762
Gosh, that is an alien.

983
00:36:54,222 --> 00:36:56,622
(It sure looks like an alien.)

984
00:36:56,722 --> 00:36:59,092
(I was a fool to believe you're the ace.)

985
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:00,862
(It doesn't look like a model at all.)

986
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:03,292
- Was it a model? - I think it looks like an alien.

987
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:05,592
(We learn that the first step is crucial.)

988
00:37:06,062 --> 00:37:07,962
- Did you see what Jae Jin drew? - We have to imagine it.

989
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:10,162
(I didn't become the first runner to be treated like this.)

990
00:37:11,192 --> 00:37:12,192
(They change the order.)

991
00:37:12,192 --> 00:37:14,322
I think Ji Won should go first.

992
00:37:14,322 --> 00:37:15,992
(Ji Won and Jae Jin switch places.)

993
00:37:16,362 --> 00:37:18,432
Jae Jin is flustered.

994
00:37:18,762 --> 00:37:19,792
It was funny.

995
00:37:19,792 --> 00:37:20,862
(Did he plan everything as the food thief?)

996
00:37:21,092 --> 00:37:23,162
Ready, set...

997
00:37:23,162 --> 00:37:24,162
(They get ready for the second question.)

998
00:37:24,892 --> 00:37:27,592
(If they fail this time, they should give up this abundant meal.)

999
00:37:27,592 --> 00:37:28,592
Start.

1000
00:37:29,392 --> 00:37:31,462
(The answer to this critical question is a flight attendant.)

1001
00:37:31,462 --> 00:37:33,792
This is easy. This is too easy.

1002
00:37:34,092 --> 00:37:35,162
It must be easy.

1003
00:37:35,262 --> 00:37:36,592
I'll start drawing.

1004
00:37:36,592 --> 00:37:38,392
(You can just draw a plane for this job.)

1005
00:37:39,162 --> 00:37:40,162
Three,

1006
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:41,792
four...

1007
00:37:41,932 --> 00:37:43,292
(The drawing is about to take off.)

1008
00:37:43,292 --> 00:37:45,432
- I'm done. - Wasn't it too long?

1009
00:37:46,022 --> 00:37:51,622
(He described it with a plane and a person in a nice skirt.)

1010
00:37:51,622 --> 00:37:53,092
What does the person mean?

1011
00:37:56,092 --> 00:37:57,592
How can they guess it correctly?

1012
00:37:57,592 --> 00:37:58,622
One...

1013
00:37:58,622 --> 00:38:01,322
(Did Jae Jin get the hang of it this time?)

1014
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:03,322
Four, five.

1015
00:38:04,322 --> 00:38:05,462
Oh my.

1016
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,892
- Show us first. Just show us. - We need to figure it out.

1017
00:38:08,892 --> 00:38:11,522
- Right. Right. That's spot on. - What is that?

1018
00:38:13,092 --> 00:38:17,092
- In 3, 4, 5. - Is it a plane? What is that?

1019
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:18,592
Show them.

1020
00:38:18,592 --> 00:38:20,492
(Is this correct?)

1021
00:38:22,722 --> 00:38:23,822
You won't figure it out.

1022
00:38:23,822 --> 00:38:25,462
(Can it be a stingray?)

1023
00:38:25,462 --> 00:38:27,462
- What on earth is this? - I don't have any clue.

1024
00:38:27,462 --> 00:38:29,562
They started questioning what it is.

1025
00:38:29,792 --> 00:38:31,362
It doesn't even look like a shark.

1026
00:38:32,932 --> 00:38:34,522
(Su Won is agonized.)

1027
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:36,392
- Hey, I think we won. - Seriously?

1028
00:38:36,392 --> 00:38:39,022
- I have a feeling that we won. - Didn't they say it was easy?

1029
00:38:39,292 --> 00:38:40,622
Su Won, you should at least start.

1030
00:38:41,062 --> 00:38:42,392
It doesn't matter even if he starts.

1031
00:38:42,822 --> 00:38:44,662
(He starts to draw.)

1032
00:38:44,662 --> 00:38:48,362
Two, three, four...

1033
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:50,262
(Laughing)

1034
00:38:51,432 --> 00:38:53,222
(His magical drawing brings smiles to people who see it.)

1035
00:38:53,222 --> 00:38:54,722
- You guys are last. - Hold on.

1036
00:38:54,722 --> 00:38:56,622
(His magical drawing brings smiles to people who see it.)

1037
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,192
What is this? Is this a fish?

1038
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:01,162
Somehow there was something that looked like this.

1039
00:39:02,162 --> 00:39:03,192
(Plane became sujebi.)

1040
00:39:03,192 --> 00:39:04,262
(A person with a skirt became a naked person dancing.)

1041
00:39:04,262 --> 00:39:05,392
You can't figure it out, can you?

1042
00:39:06,092 --> 00:39:07,862
How can you possibly know what it is from this drawing?

1043
00:39:07,932 --> 00:39:10,292
(His drawing is absurd to understand.)

1044
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:12,592
When you look at the drawing, think about occupations.

1045
00:39:12,592 --> 00:39:14,592
(There's a cloud over their heads.)

1046
00:39:14,992 --> 00:39:20,492
(What they need is a miracle from Jae Duck.)

1047
00:39:20,522 --> 00:39:23,892
(The way he uses his pen makes Kwang Soo think...)

1048
00:39:23,892 --> 00:39:25,092
I'll bet my everything...

1049
00:39:25,092 --> 00:39:26,192
that we will win.

1050
00:39:27,322 --> 00:39:29,822
(Finally the drawing is revealed.)

1051
00:39:29,822 --> 00:39:31,622
I don't think I can look at it. I'm scared.

1052
00:39:32,362 --> 00:39:33,432
It scares me.

1053
00:39:33,432 --> 00:39:35,162
- Don't you feel nervous? - I'm too scared to show her.

1054
00:39:35,162 --> 00:39:36,792
(What kind of drawing did Jae Duck come up with?)

1055
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:38,322
He drew something similar to a wine opener.

1056
00:39:39,362 --> 00:39:41,392
(He presents it.)

1057
00:39:41,692 --> 00:39:42,862
We won.

1058
00:39:47,222 --> 00:39:48,992
(Is it the drawing without any embellishment?)

1059
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,262
Did you draw as it is?

1060
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,962
- Almost. It's very close. - Almost?

1061
00:39:51,962 --> 00:39:53,092
It's almost an exact copy.

1062
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:55,862
(This is the exact copy?)

1063
00:39:55,862 --> 00:39:59,932
- I mean he drew well... - This is challenging. Seriously.

1064
00:39:59,992 --> 00:40:02,162
- You can figure it out, though. - Sure. Sure.

1065
00:40:02,162 --> 00:40:03,522
(An alien invades the Earth with a spacecraft.)

1066
00:40:03,522 --> 00:40:05,462
My gosh. What on earth is this?

1067
00:40:05,462 --> 00:40:07,522
(I'm speechless.)

1068
00:40:07,522 --> 00:40:09,092
The drawing shows a job?

1069
00:40:10,762 --> 00:40:12,622
I'm sure the drawing describes a job.

1070
00:40:13,192 --> 00:40:14,492
Think carefully.

1071
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,222
Think who would have that sort of job around us.

1072
00:40:17,722 --> 00:40:18,862
It's a job?

1073
00:40:19,522 --> 00:40:20,792
I'm sure the job exists.

1074
00:40:20,792 --> 00:40:25,522
(Something weird floats in the air, and there's a strange person.)

1075
00:40:25,522 --> 00:40:27,022
(Can she figure out it's stewardess?)

1076
00:40:27,022 --> 00:40:28,392
In 1, 2, 3.

1077
00:40:29,592 --> 00:40:31,562
A hunter.

1078
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,092
- My gosh. - Goodness.

1079
00:40:33,092 --> 00:40:34,892
(Team Ji Hyo will face the penalty.)

1080
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:35,992
Come here.

1081
00:40:35,992 --> 00:40:37,662
(Team Seul Hye wins.)

1082
00:40:37,662 --> 00:40:39,162
- Okay. - Let's eat.

1083
00:40:39,162 --> 00:40:40,762
- Let's eat. - Let's have the meal.

1084
00:40:40,762 --> 00:40:42,662
- We won. - Let's eat.

1085
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:45,292
- What was that? - Get over here.

1086
00:40:45,662 --> 00:40:46,692
Who was it?

1087
00:40:46,692 --> 00:40:49,592
- The answer was a flight attendant. - Stewardess. It's stewardess.

1088
00:40:49,592 --> 00:40:51,192
That's what it was supposed to be?

1089
00:40:51,222 --> 00:40:52,962
- You drew a stewardess? - It's a stewardess.

1090
00:40:52,962 --> 00:40:54,392
This was supposed to be a flight attendant.

1091
00:40:54,692 --> 00:40:55,692
(Was it you?)

1092
00:40:56,762 --> 00:40:57,892
I see. It was a flight attendant.

1093
00:40:58,362 --> 00:41:00,932
(You know what you did wrong.)

1094
00:41:00,932 --> 00:41:03,492
I thought... I thought it was a shark.

1095
00:41:05,292 --> 00:41:06,462
This doesn't make sense?

1096
00:41:06,462 --> 00:41:08,492
(Is Su Won the food thief?)

1097
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:11,362
(A hearty meal is served.)

1098
00:41:11,362 --> 00:41:13,322
- Thank you. - He did really well.

1099
00:41:13,392 --> 00:41:17,792
(It's a meal with rice from Icheon given to the winning team.)

1100
00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:19,462
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

1101
00:41:19,462 --> 00:41:21,092
- Thank you. - This is all because of you.

1102
00:41:21,092 --> 00:41:22,322
(It's good to be winners.)

1103
00:41:22,322 --> 00:41:23,992
- Seriously. - I didn't know we would win.

1104
00:41:24,462 --> 00:41:25,892
You did really well.

1105
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:27,622
The rice is amazing.

1106
00:41:28,622 --> 00:41:30,862
- The texture is very different. - Rice from Icheon is so tasty.

1107
00:41:31,092 --> 00:41:32,692
This is indeed delicious.

1108
00:41:32,692 --> 00:41:34,322
(They enjoy their lunch in Icheon. It is known for good quality rice.)

1109
00:41:34,322 --> 00:41:36,522
- I can taste the difference. - Rice from Icheon is very good.

1110
00:41:37,392 --> 00:41:42,362
(They enjoy their meal with side dishes. How about the losing team?)

1111
00:41:42,362 --> 00:41:43,932
- We need to hold it? - Do we need to carry it around?

1112
00:41:43,932 --> 00:41:45,522
(We only get a bowl of rice?)

1113
00:41:45,522 --> 00:41:48,592
(They'll have to enjoy the rice without side dishes on the street.)

1114
00:41:48,592 --> 00:41:50,432
The rice smells so good.

1115
00:41:50,492 --> 00:41:51,562
We can eat this, right?

1116
00:41:52,492 --> 00:41:53,592
Take your chopsticks.

1117
00:41:53,592 --> 00:41:55,092
(It's as if he's eating his sadness away.)

1118
00:41:56,462 --> 00:41:57,692
Why don't we start over there?

1119
00:41:58,222 --> 00:41:59,432
(They must get 6 side dishes, but they can get 2 from each house.)

1120
00:41:59,432 --> 00:42:01,162
What a coincidence. There are people outside.

1121
00:42:01,692 --> 00:42:03,292
- They are making kimchi. - They must be making kimchi.

1122
00:42:03,992 --> 00:42:05,662
- Hello. - Hi.

1123
00:42:06,292 --> 00:42:07,932
- What are you doing? - Is it soy sauce?

1124
00:42:07,932 --> 00:42:09,822
Sikhye. They are making sikhye.

1125
00:42:09,822 --> 00:42:11,362
- Sikhye. - Could we get some?

1126
00:42:11,492 --> 00:42:13,822
Sikhye isn't a side dish. It's a dessert.

1127
00:42:14,022 --> 00:42:15,662
I eat my rice with sikhye.

1128
00:42:16,962 --> 00:42:17,992
(He's already trying to cheat his way out.)

1129
00:42:17,992 --> 00:42:20,092
- They are making a lot of sikhye. - That's a lot.

1130
00:42:20,092 --> 00:42:21,522
- Hello. - Hi.

1131
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:23,392
- Hello. - You are all celebrities.

1132
00:42:23,392 --> 00:42:25,662
- We have a mission to complete. - Yes?

1133
00:42:25,662 --> 00:42:29,262
If we find the most generous person in this town,

1134
00:42:29,462 --> 00:42:31,362
- SBS will give you a cash prize. - Really?

1135
00:42:31,362 --> 00:42:33,262
(SBS will give you a cash prize.)

1136
00:42:33,662 --> 00:42:36,362
- Stop cheating. You are cheating. - It's not true?

1137
00:42:36,362 --> 00:42:37,792
Hello.

1138
00:42:37,792 --> 00:42:39,592
We need to...

1139
00:42:39,592 --> 00:42:42,062
have a meal. We didn't eat at all today.

1140
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:43,062
I can give you rice. Follow me.

1141
00:42:43,062 --> 00:42:45,362
- Side dishes, please. - Can we have some side dishes?

1142
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:47,192
- Please give us side dishes. - We need to...

1143
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:51,092
- Look at that. - You have the best kimchi in town.

1144
00:42:51,462 --> 00:42:53,622
I can eat the whole bowl with just kkakdugi.

1145
00:42:54,192 --> 00:42:56,092
- This is her house. - We'll wait here.

1146
00:42:56,762 --> 00:42:59,492
The people in this town are so generous.

1147
00:42:59,892 --> 00:43:02,222
They are known for their generosity.

1148
00:43:03,592 --> 00:43:04,892
(Cheering)

1149
00:43:04,892 --> 00:43:06,222
We only need two.

1150
00:43:06,962 --> 00:43:09,262
(Side dishes descend upon them.)

1151
00:43:09,262 --> 00:43:11,222
(Start your praise. Here comes the side dishes.)

1152
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:12,662
- Just give us two of them. - My gosh.

1153
00:43:12,662 --> 00:43:14,162
- We'll use chopsticks. - I want dried seaweed.

1154
00:43:14,862 --> 00:43:15,992
Thank you so much.

1155
00:43:15,992 --> 00:43:17,522
(They can only choose two side dishes from each house.)

1156
00:43:17,522 --> 00:43:19,462
Okay. Hold on. Let me put it here.

1157
00:43:20,262 --> 00:43:21,992
Thank you so much.

1158
00:43:22,692 --> 00:43:23,822
We love you.

1159
00:43:24,762 --> 00:43:26,092
Thank you for the food.

1160
00:43:26,392 --> 00:43:28,562
- I chose two. - I did, too.

1161
00:43:28,562 --> 00:43:29,722
- What is this? - I chose deodeok and kimchi.

1162
00:43:29,722 --> 00:43:31,322
It's balloon flower root salad.

1163
00:43:31,322 --> 00:43:33,662
- How about the dried seaweed? - It's not allowed.

1164
00:43:33,662 --> 00:43:34,892
It's not allowed? I see.

1165
00:43:34,892 --> 00:43:36,262
(They successfully eat two side dishes.)

1166
00:43:36,262 --> 00:43:37,432
Thank you so much.

1167
00:43:37,432 --> 00:43:39,622
- Thank you so much. - Thank you for the food.

1168
00:43:39,622 --> 00:43:41,222
(We appreciate helping them despite their sudden begging.)

1169
00:43:41,222 --> 00:43:42,522
Take care.

1170
00:43:42,822 --> 00:43:44,362
- Let's go now. - She is so nice.

1171
00:43:44,792 --> 00:43:46,562
- We can just eat it now. - Yes.

1172
00:43:46,822 --> 00:43:47,992
Here?

1173
00:43:48,222 --> 00:43:51,392
How can you let us eat on the street?

1174
00:43:52,292 --> 00:43:54,222
- We are already begging for food. - Come on.

1175
00:43:55,892 --> 00:43:57,192
We are already paupers.

1176
00:43:57,192 --> 00:43:59,092
(They are a group of attractive beggars.)

1177
00:43:59,092 --> 00:44:01,562
Because the rice is good, it's still tasty just with kimchi.

1178
00:44:03,622 --> 00:44:06,092
I think she grilled the balloon flower roots.

1179
00:44:06,092 --> 00:44:08,162
- Let's get going. - Let's go.

1180
00:44:08,892 --> 00:44:10,062
It's so delicious.

1181
00:44:10,292 --> 00:44:11,662
I might need more rice.

1182
00:44:11,822 --> 00:44:14,922
- We need more rice. - We don't have enough rice.

1183
00:44:15,522 --> 00:44:18,462
I can eat and digest while I'm walking.

1184
00:44:19,862 --> 00:44:21,262
Hello.

1185
00:44:22,222 --> 00:44:24,222
You are about to make kimchi.

1186
00:44:24,222 --> 00:44:25,922
Look at all the Chinese cabbages in the front garden.

1187
00:44:25,922 --> 00:44:28,092
We have a bowl of rice from Icheon,

1188
00:44:28,092 --> 00:44:30,822
but we don't have side dishes. Could you give us two side dishes?

1189
00:44:31,192 --> 00:44:32,422
It's kimchi.

1190
00:44:32,422 --> 00:44:34,292
(Of course. She brings out gimjang kimchi.)

1191
00:44:34,292 --> 00:44:35,622
- I like gimjang kimchi. - I'm fine with it.

1192
00:44:35,792 --> 00:44:36,892
Is it spring onion kimchi?

1193
00:44:37,992 --> 00:44:40,492
- Didn't you eat kimchi just now? - That was geotjeori.

1194
00:44:40,492 --> 00:44:42,592
You can't eat the same side dish.

1195
00:44:42,592 --> 00:44:45,162
That's not geotjeori. It's gimjang kimchi.

1196
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,722
Excuse me, isn't it gimjang kimchi?

1197
00:44:47,962 --> 00:44:49,962
- Yes, right. It's gimjang kimchi. - This is fully fermented.

1198
00:44:49,962 --> 00:44:52,092
- This one is fermented. - That's right.

1199
00:44:52,492 --> 00:44:55,262
- Geotjeori is not the same kimchi. - Exactly.

1200
00:44:55,262 --> 00:44:56,592
Thank you so much.

1201
00:44:57,222 --> 00:44:58,662
Thank you for the food.

1202
00:44:59,262 --> 00:45:00,322
That looks delicious.

1203
00:45:01,222 --> 00:45:03,622
- Are you only eating kimchi? - This is really good.

1204
00:45:03,862 --> 00:45:06,262
This is so tasty.

1205
00:45:07,422 --> 00:45:10,392
We can also get one of the cabbages over there...

1206
00:45:11,022 --> 00:45:12,892
- and if we only have ssamjang... - We can eat it with ssamjang.

1207
00:45:13,662 --> 00:45:15,992
That will give us another side dish.

1208
00:45:15,992 --> 00:45:18,092
- That's right. - I think that counts.

1209
00:45:18,092 --> 00:45:19,522
- Of course. - Right.

1210
00:45:21,392 --> 00:45:23,222
How did you think of this?

1211
00:45:23,662 --> 00:45:25,522
- Eating it by itself is also good. - Yes, that's right.

1212
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:27,422
(They are eating three dishes out of cabbages. It's a cabbage trip.)

1213
00:45:27,422 --> 00:45:29,062
This cabbage is priceless.

1214
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:30,862
The cabbage itself is sweet.

1215
00:45:31,922 --> 00:45:34,092
- The cabbage is amazing. - There're even garlics in ssamjang.

1216
00:45:35,722 --> 00:45:36,892
This is delicious.

1217
00:45:37,462 --> 00:45:38,892
It's indeed tasty.

1218
00:45:39,722 --> 00:45:41,592
This cabbage leaf is crunchy.

1219
00:45:43,162 --> 00:45:45,092
(Why don't you let the cameramen to taste some?)

1220
00:45:45,092 --> 00:45:46,492
- What? - Give some for the cameramen.

1221
00:45:46,492 --> 00:45:47,792
You need to work for it.

1222
00:45:49,322 --> 00:45:51,062
You can each get two.

1223
00:45:51,962 --> 00:45:53,092
You're mean.

1224
00:45:53,092 --> 00:45:54,322
Did you say I'm mean?

1225
00:45:54,662 --> 00:45:55,962
Did you just find that out?

1226
00:45:56,922 --> 00:45:58,222
He's known to be mean.

1227
00:46:00,022 --> 00:46:01,092
Excuse me.

1228
00:46:01,862 --> 00:46:06,092
By any chance, do you have different types of kimchi?

1229
00:46:06,322 --> 00:46:08,092
- I have gat kimchi. - You have gat kimchi?

1230
00:46:08,092 --> 00:46:09,822
- I have gat kimchi. - Really?

1231
00:46:10,092 --> 00:46:11,422
Let's go and eat some gat kimchi.

1232
00:46:11,822 --> 00:46:13,822
We need to taste gat kimchi.

1233
00:46:15,262 --> 00:46:16,322
Look at that gat kimchi.

1234
00:46:16,322 --> 00:46:17,822
(Divine gat kimchi is on the move.)

1235
00:46:17,822 --> 00:46:19,792
- That looks delicious. - I bet gat kimchi is amazing.

1236
00:46:19,862 --> 00:46:21,392
I can even smell it from here.

1237
00:46:23,362 --> 00:46:24,762
Do you have disposable plates?

1238
00:46:24,762 --> 00:46:25,992
(Ji Hyo comes to escort gat kimchi outside.)

1239
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,462
This looks savory.

1240
00:46:27,892 --> 00:46:29,162
(How wonderful.)

1241
00:46:31,092 --> 00:46:32,392
Look at this gat kimchi.

1242
00:46:33,622 --> 00:46:35,922
- This looks really delicious. - It does, indeed.

1243
00:46:35,922 --> 00:46:37,422
I can even smell it from here.

1244
00:46:39,322 --> 00:46:40,992
(He takes a bite.)

1245
00:46:40,992 --> 00:46:41,992
It's tasty.

1246
00:46:43,192 --> 00:46:46,692
(It even impresses Su Won as it is the taste of rich kimchi.)

1247
00:46:46,692 --> 00:46:47,922
This is incredible.

1248
00:46:48,062 --> 00:46:50,092
(It is completely delicious.)

1249
00:46:50,092 --> 00:46:52,092
- It's absolutely savory. - It is, isn't it?

1250
00:46:53,422 --> 00:46:54,462
(It's absolutely tasty.)

1251
00:46:54,592 --> 00:46:57,362
- Really. - This is totally different.

1252
00:46:58,292 --> 00:46:59,462
I happened to have this, too.

1253
00:46:59,992 --> 00:47:02,322
My gosh. Thank you so much.

1254
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:04,692
- What is it? - It's pickled garlic.

1255
00:47:04,692 --> 00:47:07,162
- That's it. - This ends our penalty.

1256
00:47:07,162 --> 00:47:08,492
Your kimchi is top notch.

1257
00:47:08,762 --> 00:47:10,162
This kimchi is the best.

1258
00:47:12,322 --> 00:47:15,692
Here's gat kimchi. She said she can give us more if we any rice left.

1259
00:47:15,692 --> 00:47:17,522
(Gat kimchi and pickled garlic are the perfect combination.)

1260
00:47:17,522 --> 00:47:19,862
Gat kimchi is amazing.

1261
00:47:20,722 --> 00:47:22,862
- This is really tasty gat kimchi. - You didn't get to eat, right?

1262
00:47:23,292 --> 00:47:24,662
There isn't much left.

1263
00:47:25,362 --> 00:47:27,062
Can I have a spoon of your rice?

1264
00:47:28,462 --> 00:47:29,762
(Mean Ji Won steals a spoon of rice.)

1265
00:47:29,762 --> 00:47:31,562
- Do you still have some rice left? - Yes.

1266
00:47:31,562 --> 00:47:32,992
- This is my second bowl. - You are eating another one?

1267
00:47:33,262 --> 00:47:35,662
With gat kimchi, I can finish a bowl of rice with no problem.

1268
00:47:37,562 --> 00:47:39,562
- This is amazing. Try it. - Right.

1269
00:47:40,192 --> 00:47:41,292
Really.

1270
00:47:42,222 --> 00:47:45,092
- It's not what I expected. - It's the tastiest kimchi ever.

1271
00:47:45,292 --> 00:47:46,692
- You, too? - Isn't it different?

1272
00:47:46,962 --> 00:47:48,822
The shape is the same.

1273
00:47:48,822 --> 00:47:50,992
It's not as thick as other ones.

1274
00:47:50,992 --> 00:47:54,022
(Ji Hyo shares gat kimchi with the cameramen.)

1275
00:47:54,022 --> 00:47:55,592
(And a man stares at her.)

1276
00:47:56,292 --> 00:47:57,322
(Is someone looking staring at me?)

1277
00:47:57,322 --> 00:47:58,422
Isn't it good?

1278
00:47:58,422 --> 00:48:00,092
(Is someone looking staring at me?)

1279
00:48:01,422 --> 00:48:03,692
Ji Hyo, can you give me a bite, too?

1280
00:48:04,692 --> 00:48:06,022
I want to taste the kimchi you give me.

1281
00:48:06,062 --> 00:48:07,722
(I want to taste the kimchi you give me.)

1282
00:48:08,592 --> 00:48:11,422
There isn't much food, so please help yourself.

1283
00:48:12,722 --> 00:48:14,362
Please give me a bite.

1284
00:48:15,522 --> 00:48:18,622
Here, take a bite. It's really delicious.

1285
00:48:18,622 --> 00:48:20,222
Should I also hold a camera to be fed?

1286
00:48:20,262 --> 00:48:21,322
(Is someone on a secret mission?)

1287
00:48:21,322 --> 00:48:23,692
She'll give you a bite if you close your eyes.

1288
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,162
- May I get a bite? - Give Jae Jin a bite first.

1289
00:48:26,462 --> 00:48:27,692
I'll just eat it.

1290
00:48:29,962 --> 00:48:32,622
- We have to return them? - Yes, you finished the food.

1291
00:48:32,622 --> 00:48:34,892
(Something seems strange.)

1292
00:48:34,892 --> 00:48:36,062
(The two look very suspicious.)

1293
00:48:36,062 --> 00:48:37,962
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

1294
00:48:38,092 --> 00:48:39,622
Let's get sikhye for dessert.

1295
00:48:40,862 --> 00:48:43,822
- Sir? - Do we get one each?

1296
00:48:43,822 --> 00:48:45,192
(They get some sikhye for dessert.)

1297
00:48:45,192 --> 00:48:46,422
May I take it out?

1298
00:48:47,062 --> 00:48:49,392
- They're all the same, so take any. - Okay.

1299
00:48:50,262 --> 00:48:53,062
- We'll give you sikhye for free. - Thank you.

1300
00:48:53,522 --> 00:48:55,022
Thank you, Ma'am.

1301
00:48:55,662 --> 00:48:57,992
- You're very generous. - Cheers.

1302
00:48:58,322 --> 00:49:00,462
- Cheers. - Is this place famous for sikhye?

1303
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,322
(He links arms with her and takes a sip.)

1304
00:49:03,792 --> 00:49:05,722
- Enjoy it. - Is it made with Icheon rice?

1305
00:49:05,762 --> 00:49:07,962
Yes, it is.

1306
00:49:08,022 --> 00:49:09,892
(He smiles.)

1307
00:49:10,222 --> 00:49:13,062
(Why is he smiling to the camera?)

1308
00:49:14,222 --> 00:49:19,992
(Su Won smiles because he's the food thief.)

1309
00:49:19,992 --> 00:49:22,762
"You're the food thief."

1310
00:49:22,762 --> 00:49:26,492
"Accomplish your hidden mission and win 100 bags of rice."

1311
00:49:26,492 --> 00:49:28,422
"If you succeed, you can donate rice under your name."

1312
00:49:28,592 --> 00:49:31,262
"If not, you're punished."

1313
00:49:31,462 --> 00:49:34,092
(The mission is to reveal Jae Jin's abdomen.)

1314
00:49:34,092 --> 00:49:35,192
Jae Jin.

1315
00:49:36,262 --> 00:49:38,962
- Really? - Let me see.

1316
00:49:38,962 --> 00:49:40,762
(He pretends to check Jae Jin's microphone.)

1317
00:49:40,762 --> 00:49:42,162
- Is it okay? - Yes.

1318
00:49:42,162 --> 00:49:44,092
You should put it under your shirt.

1319
00:49:44,422 --> 00:49:50,362
(The producer approaches him after the first game.)

1320
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:53,592
(The hidden mission is to link arms with the lady and drink.)

1321
00:49:53,622 --> 00:49:54,992
Thank you, Ma'am.

1322
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,992
(He looks for an opportunity.)

1323
00:49:58,422 --> 00:50:01,922
(He succeeds his mission.)

1324
00:50:03,492 --> 00:50:05,892
Thank you for giving us delicious sikhye.

1325
00:50:05,892 --> 00:50:07,322
- It's so delicious. - Really?

1326
00:50:07,392 --> 00:50:10,092
It's perfect to finish with sikhye after eating rice and gat kimchi.

1327
00:50:10,092 --> 00:50:11,762
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

1328
00:50:11,962 --> 00:50:14,622
- Thank you, Ma'am. - Thank you.

1329
00:50:14,622 --> 00:50:16,022
Thank you.

1330
00:50:16,022 --> 00:50:19,692
(Su Won of Team Sechs Kies is the food thief.)

1331
00:50:21,422 --> 00:50:24,062
- Did you get any food? - I had a bowl of rice.

1332
00:50:24,092 --> 00:50:28,522
Team Running Man won Round Two.

1333
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:31,422
- Seul Hye gets a hint. - Is that so?

1334
00:50:31,422 --> 00:50:33,092
The hint will tell you who the food thief is.

1335
00:50:33,092 --> 00:50:34,722
- Okay. - Confirm that it's not me.

1336
00:50:34,792 --> 00:50:37,422
- Me, neither. - You'll narrow down the suspects.

1337
00:50:37,892 --> 00:50:41,222
Seul Hye, you'll find out that I'm definitely not the food thief.

1338
00:50:41,222 --> 00:50:43,022
(Whom will Seul Hye choose?)

1339
00:50:43,022 --> 00:50:45,392
(He's nervous that it might be him.)

1340
00:50:46,562 --> 00:50:48,692
- What is it? - You should apologize to me.

1341
00:50:48,722 --> 00:50:51,022
She suddenly looked up at Kwang Soo.

1342
00:50:51,922 --> 00:50:52,962
- What's the hint? - I'm so curious.

1343
00:50:52,962 --> 00:50:54,092
What is she trying to do?

1344
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,092
(Let me think.)

1345
00:50:55,292 --> 00:50:56,992
What is she thinking? She's looking at us.

1346
00:50:56,992 --> 00:50:58,762
I'll exchange a servant.

1347
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:01,422
- You'll exchange someone? - Yes.

1348
00:51:01,422 --> 00:51:03,222
(Did she find out about me?)

1349
00:51:03,262 --> 00:51:04,962
- Jae Seok. - Jae Seok?

1350
00:51:04,962 --> 00:51:06,222
- Kwang Soo. - Me, too?

1351
00:51:06,222 --> 00:51:09,192
(Both of you are out.)

1352
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:11,362
- Seul Hye, I'm really not it. - I'm not it, either.

1353
00:51:11,362 --> 00:51:13,262
- My goodness. - I'm really not the thief.

1354
00:51:13,262 --> 00:51:15,522
- Seul Hye. - I didn't do anything suspicious.

1355
00:51:15,522 --> 00:51:18,762
Jae Seok and Kwang Soo, please move to the other team.

1356
00:51:20,692 --> 00:51:25,862
(There's a certain letter in the food thief's last name.)

1357
00:51:25,862 --> 00:51:27,922
This is so frustrating.

1358
00:51:27,922 --> 00:51:30,562
- You're the thief, aren't you? - No, it's you.

1359
00:51:30,892 --> 00:51:32,862
- Isn't it you? - I think the hint said it's you.

1360
00:51:32,862 --> 00:51:34,522
- My goodness. - Gosh.

1361
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:36,162
Sung Hoon, come this way.

1362
00:51:36,322 --> 00:51:37,892
(The new servants are...)

1363
00:51:37,892 --> 00:51:39,962
(Sung Hoon?)

1364
00:51:39,962 --> 00:51:42,762
- Come this way. - See? I'm not the thief.

1365
00:51:42,822 --> 00:51:45,592
- You're definitely a suspect. - I told you that I wasn't.

1366
00:51:45,592 --> 00:51:47,092
Okay, we heard you.

1367
00:51:47,792 --> 00:51:49,722
- Ji Hyo. - What is it?

1368
00:51:49,862 --> 00:51:52,092
(Why were we selected?)

1369
00:51:52,962 --> 00:51:55,822
(Both of their last names contain the letter O.)

1370
00:51:56,862 --> 00:51:59,062
- Hey. - What?

1371
00:51:59,392 --> 00:52:01,022
I'm not the thief.

1372
00:52:01,962 --> 00:52:03,662
- What's wrong? - I made a mistake.

1373
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,422
- You did? - I made a mistake.

1374
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:07,822
Wait, may I exchange the members again?

1375
00:52:07,822 --> 00:52:09,462
She can't exchange again.

1376
00:52:10,022 --> 00:52:11,692
- It's not allowed. - I got confused.

1377
00:52:11,892 --> 00:52:13,092
She got confused.

1378
00:52:13,092 --> 00:52:15,822
- I got confused. - Thank you for taking Su Won.

1379
00:52:15,822 --> 00:52:16,862
(He looks nervous.)

1380
00:52:16,862 --> 00:52:19,162
Thank you so much for taking Su Won to your team.

1381
00:52:19,662 --> 00:52:21,722
(Team Running Man and Team Sechs Kies)

1382
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:24,262
(Su Won, the food thief, is on Team Running Man.)

1383
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:28,792
You'll play "Toy Hammer with My Lady" for the final round.

1384
00:52:28,962 --> 00:52:30,222
"Toy Hammer with My Lady".

1385
00:52:30,562 --> 00:52:32,462
("Toy Hammer with My Lady"?)

1386
00:52:32,462 --> 00:52:36,962
The two teams will alternate between attack and defense...

1387
00:52:36,962 --> 00:52:38,562
to catch the taggers.

1388
00:52:38,562 --> 00:52:41,922
The taggers of the attacking team are a servant and the lady.

1389
00:52:42,222 --> 00:52:46,262
Only the lady can eliminate the members by popping their balloon.

1390
00:52:46,762 --> 00:52:48,762
There's a time limit for each attack.

1391
00:52:48,922 --> 00:52:51,592
The taggers can attack the other team only while...

1392
00:52:52,222 --> 00:52:54,792
the remaining four servants are doing a mission.

1393
00:52:56,192 --> 00:52:59,192
The team that eliminates more members wins.

1394
00:52:59,822 --> 00:53:02,492
(Who will win the game?)

1395
00:53:02,492 --> 00:53:03,722
Let's spread out.

1396
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:07,322
(Team Running Man attacks while Team Sechs Kies defends.)

1397
00:53:09,222 --> 00:53:10,492
What's going on?

1398
00:53:10,492 --> 00:53:11,922
What's the ice for?

1399
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:14,092
I don't want ice in this weather.

1400
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,822
(Cone Sitting)

1401
00:53:16,822 --> 00:53:18,292
(Hula Hoop)

1402
00:53:18,292 --> 00:53:20,162
(Barefoot on Ice)

1403
00:53:20,162 --> 00:53:22,222
(Leg Split)

1404
00:53:22,222 --> 00:53:24,722
(Endure these 4 activities.)

1405
00:53:24,792 --> 00:53:26,462
There you go.

1406
00:53:26,462 --> 00:53:28,492
- You should do this one. - He's good at it.

1407
00:53:29,092 --> 00:53:31,722
- Wait a minute. - He can last for two hours.

1408
00:53:32,622 --> 00:53:33,822
Does it feel good?

1409
00:53:35,092 --> 00:53:38,092
Gosh, this may damage my health.

1410
00:53:38,092 --> 00:53:40,162
I can do it, but it's probably unhealthy.

1411
00:53:40,362 --> 00:53:42,292
I'll sit on the cone. I think I can do it.

1412
00:53:43,622 --> 00:53:46,722
(Taggers)

1413
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:49,192
(The defending team goes to hide.)

1414
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:50,862
There's no place to hide.

1415
00:53:50,862 --> 00:53:53,622
(The defending team goes to hide.)

1416
00:53:56,362 --> 00:54:01,192
(What is he doing with the basin?)

1417
00:54:01,192 --> 00:54:04,722
(He goes under the basin.)

1418
00:54:04,722 --> 00:54:10,392
(Ji Won disappears.)

1419
00:54:10,392 --> 00:54:13,522
Gosh, it's way too small.

1420
00:54:15,062 --> 00:54:18,492
(He hides himself under a bigger basin.)

1421
00:54:18,492 --> 00:54:20,922
(He hides himself completely.)

1422
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,662
(While Ji Won is hiding under a basin,)

1423
00:54:24,662 --> 00:54:27,892
(Kwang Soo hurries up to the mountain.)

1424
00:54:27,892 --> 00:54:31,092
They won't be able to find me here. Please get closer.

1425
00:54:32,192 --> 00:54:35,662
(The balloon pops.)

1426
00:54:38,662 --> 00:54:41,092
(Kwang Soo is out.)

1427
00:54:41,092 --> 00:54:44,392
(The balloon pops and leaves flour on his helmet.)

1428
00:54:44,392 --> 00:54:45,562
Wait a minute.

1429
00:54:46,362 --> 00:54:47,422
Sir?

1430
00:54:48,992 --> 00:54:52,422
(Kwang Soo is very unlucky.)

1431
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:54,062
This is unfair, don't you think?

1432
00:54:54,062 --> 00:54:55,192
(Now, he'll look even more suspicious.)

1433
00:54:55,192 --> 00:54:56,362
This is not what I meant.

1434
00:54:57,662 --> 00:54:58,692
(One member is already out.)

1435
00:54:58,692 --> 00:55:00,562
We'll start after 10 seconds.

1436
00:55:01,092 --> 00:55:04,462
In 10, 9, 8...

1437
00:55:04,462 --> 00:55:06,492
- Go, you can eliminate all. - Seven...

1438
00:55:06,892 --> 00:55:14,022
(How many of Team Sechs Kies will Team Running Man eliminate?)

1439
00:55:14,092 --> 00:55:15,192
Start.

1440
00:55:15,322 --> 00:55:17,662
We must catch them quickly.

1441
00:55:17,662 --> 00:55:18,822
The game started.

1442
00:55:19,162 --> 00:55:20,492
Can you help and hold me up?

1443
00:55:20,922 --> 00:55:22,892
- In one... - Be careful.

1444
00:55:22,892 --> 00:55:24,362
(Haha starts to sit on the cone.)

1445
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,422
Three.

1446
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:27,692
(I must endure it.)

1447
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:28,992
(Gosh)

1448
00:55:30,662 --> 00:55:32,692
You must endure it, Haha.

1449
00:55:34,492 --> 00:55:38,162
(Why don't you try it?)

1450
00:55:38,162 --> 00:55:40,222
(He moans in pain.)

1451
00:55:40,222 --> 00:55:43,492
(For Haha who endures the pain of sitting on a cone,)

1452
00:55:43,492 --> 00:55:46,692
(Jong Kook is out to attack the other team.)

1453
00:55:48,062 --> 00:55:50,492
(Haha, hold it a little longer.)

1454
00:55:50,492 --> 00:55:52,162
- Does it hurt? - Haha, try to endure it.

1455
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:55,562
(I can't do it.)

1456
00:55:55,562 --> 00:55:57,892
(The first endurance mission is over.)

1457
00:55:57,892 --> 00:55:59,092
We're in trouble.

1458
00:55:59,092 --> 00:56:01,592
(Sung Hoon starts the hula hoop.)

1459
00:56:01,592 --> 00:56:02,992
You're doing well.

1460
00:56:03,662 --> 00:56:07,422
(There's no time to waste.)

1461
00:56:07,422 --> 00:56:09,092
Where are they hiding?

1462
00:56:11,062 --> 00:56:12,822
They'll find us here easily.

1463
00:56:13,562 --> 00:56:16,492
All of you, sit down. Goodness.

1464
00:56:16,922 --> 00:56:19,322
- Why are you standing? - You were standing, too.

1465
00:56:19,792 --> 00:56:21,222
My goodness.

1466
00:56:21,522 --> 00:56:25,022
The color of your balloon is too bright.

1467
00:56:25,322 --> 00:56:27,162
It's too easy to notice it from afar.

1468
00:56:27,322 --> 00:56:28,662
What else can I do?

1469
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:31,392
You're the one who followed me here.

1470
00:56:31,392 --> 00:56:33,592
- Goodness. - Do you know that?

1471
00:56:35,022 --> 00:56:37,562
(Fidgeting)

1472
00:56:40,592 --> 00:56:42,062
How long will this last?

1473
00:56:42,462 --> 00:56:44,162
There's no oxygen in here.

1474
00:56:46,162 --> 00:56:48,292
(He's the only one hiding in the forest.)

1475
00:56:48,292 --> 00:56:50,492
I'm getting sleepy.

1476
00:56:50,492 --> 00:56:53,162
(He's so bored of waiting that he gets sleepy.)

1477
00:56:53,992 --> 00:56:56,592
- It's falling down. - Be careful.

1478
00:56:56,592 --> 00:56:59,062
Gosh, the time is up again.

1479
00:56:59,062 --> 00:57:01,262
(There are only two activities left.)

1480
00:57:01,262 --> 00:57:02,962
This is all I have to do, right?

1481
00:57:03,292 --> 00:57:04,392
I'm exhausted.

1482
00:57:04,392 --> 00:57:05,862
(Hopefully, Seok Jin endures it.)

1483
00:57:05,862 --> 00:57:07,722
How can I stand here for a long time?

1484
00:57:07,722 --> 00:57:11,292
(Please hang in there a little longer.)

1485
00:57:13,362 --> 00:57:15,092
- Stay close. - I hear the bells.

1486
00:57:15,162 --> 00:57:16,622
Sit down.

1487
00:57:17,662 --> 00:57:20,392
(Did they spot us?)

1488
00:57:21,862 --> 00:57:25,162
(They're close to being spotted.)

1489
00:57:25,162 --> 00:57:26,292
Stay hiding.

1490
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:28,592
(The tagger with a toy hammer is getting closer.)

1491
00:57:28,592 --> 00:57:31,162
(If she finds them, they're in big trouble.)

1492
00:57:33,362 --> 00:57:34,692
She found us.

1493
00:57:35,462 --> 00:57:37,662
(Here's Seul Hye.)

1494
00:57:38,062 --> 00:57:40,192
Don't do it, Seul Hye.

1495
00:57:40,192 --> 00:57:42,192
- No, Seul Hye. - I found you.

1496
00:57:42,862 --> 00:57:46,422
(Ji Hyo escapes.)

1497
00:57:47,262 --> 00:57:48,322
Seul Hye.

1498
00:57:48,322 --> 00:57:50,592
- Please, Seul Hye. - No.

1499
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,062
(She's determined to eliminate him.)

1500
00:57:52,422 --> 00:57:53,692
Don't do it.

1501
00:57:54,862 --> 00:57:55,862
(Jae Seok is out.)

1502
00:57:55,862 --> 00:57:58,262
- Why did you do it, Seul Hye? - Gosh.

1503
00:57:59,922 --> 00:58:02,822
- Jong Kook! - Ji Hyo.

1504
00:58:03,392 --> 00:58:05,762
- Run away. - Jong Kook.

1505
00:58:05,762 --> 00:58:06,922
(Let's chase after Ji Hyo.)

1506
00:58:07,022 --> 00:58:08,892
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo makes it out of the forest...)

1507
00:58:08,892 --> 00:58:13,092
(and goes to hide near the houses.)

1508
00:58:16,862 --> 00:58:19,992
(I should be safe here.)

1509
00:58:20,822 --> 00:58:22,092
Where did she go?

1510
00:58:25,422 --> 00:58:26,722
(Did I scare you?)

1511
00:58:28,762 --> 00:58:30,022
(5 minutes ago)

1512
00:58:30,022 --> 00:58:31,392
Run!

1513
00:58:31,492 --> 00:58:32,522
Oh, gosh!

1514
00:58:32,522 --> 00:58:33,822
Where are you?

1515
00:58:33,822 --> 00:58:35,262
(She called for Jong Kook's help.)

1516
00:58:37,022 --> 00:58:38,022
She's running over there.

1517
00:58:40,722 --> 00:58:45,092
(Jong Kook caught Ji Hyo running down.)

1518
00:58:45,262 --> 00:58:47,662
(I'm on...)

1519
00:58:47,662 --> 00:58:50,622
(my way...)

1520
00:58:50,622 --> 00:58:52,292
(to see you.)

1521
00:58:52,292 --> 00:58:53,822
She's over here!

1522
00:58:54,092 --> 00:58:55,092
Come quick!

1523
00:58:56,062 --> 00:58:58,222
Jong Kook! Wait for me!

1524
00:58:58,622 --> 00:58:59,622
Where are you?

1525
00:59:00,262 --> 00:59:01,292
I followed her...

1526
00:59:01,292 --> 00:59:02,422
all the way here.

1527
00:59:03,492 --> 00:59:04,622
- Gosh. - Jong Kook.

1528
00:59:05,022 --> 00:59:06,622
- I caught someone, too. - Really?

1529
00:59:06,622 --> 00:59:08,192
- Where? - There's more.

1530
00:59:08,192 --> 00:59:09,462
(Ji Hyo is finally out.)

1531
00:59:11,692 --> 00:59:14,722
(Only Jae Duck, Ji Won and Jae Jin remain.)

1532
00:59:16,422 --> 00:59:17,722
How long has it been?

1533
00:59:17,722 --> 00:59:19,092
(Servant Seok Jin goes barefoot in this cold weather.)

1534
00:59:19,092 --> 00:59:20,422
It's 8 minutes and 40 seconds. That's pretty good, isn't it?

1535
00:59:20,422 --> 00:59:21,422
It is.

1536
00:59:21,422 --> 00:59:22,962
I'll try to make it to the 10-minute mark.

1537
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:24,822
- You're so brave. - I know, right?

1538
00:59:26,622 --> 00:59:27,662
You can do it, Seok Jin.

1539
00:59:27,662 --> 00:59:29,622
- It's starting to get to me. - You're almost there.

1540
00:59:29,622 --> 00:59:30,762
(I'm here, too.)

1541
00:59:31,522 --> 00:59:33,362
(Kwang Soo splashes water on his feet.)

1542
00:59:33,362 --> 00:59:35,222
(You got me.)

1543
00:59:35,492 --> 00:59:37,022
- That was mean. - I'm sorry.

1544
00:59:37,022 --> 00:59:38,392
- Hey! - I'm really sorry.

1545
00:59:38,392 --> 00:59:40,462
- That's not right. - Why'd you do that?

1546
00:59:40,462 --> 00:59:42,762
- My feet are freezing. - Do you want to quit?

1547
00:59:42,762 --> 00:59:45,222
(Barefeet on Ice is over.)

1548
00:59:46,622 --> 00:59:48,662
- You did good. - You lasted for so long.

1549
00:59:48,662 --> 00:59:50,492
(Only one mission remains.)

1550
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:53,322
(He's as stiff as a robot.)

1551
00:59:53,322 --> 00:59:54,392
Oh, gosh.

1552
00:59:54,392 --> 00:59:56,992
(He's as stiff as a robot.)

1553
00:59:56,992 --> 00:59:59,322
(He looks like he's ready to give up already.)

1554
01:00:00,892 --> 01:00:02,062
Hold on for just a little longer.

1555
01:00:02,822 --> 01:00:03,862
I'm almost there.

1556
01:00:05,722 --> 01:00:06,892
(Jong Kook spots Jae Jin on a container.)

1557
01:00:08,222 --> 01:00:09,722
(He has nowhere to go.)

1558
01:00:11,362 --> 01:00:13,192
(I told you it's dangerous outside.)

1559
01:00:15,322 --> 01:00:17,192
(He doesn't know what to do.)

1560
01:00:19,462 --> 01:00:21,992
(He makes his last effort.)

1561
01:00:21,992 --> 01:00:24,722
(He jumps off the roof.)

1562
01:00:26,262 --> 01:00:27,462
(He runs away.)

1563
01:00:28,422 --> 01:00:29,422
It's so cold.

1564
01:00:30,322 --> 01:00:31,362
Oh, gosh.

1565
01:00:31,922 --> 01:00:34,622
(He's making a run.)

1566
01:00:34,622 --> 01:00:38,092
(He's trying to get as far away as possble from Jong Kook.)

1567
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:41,492
(Jong Kook is after him.)

1568
01:00:41,492 --> 01:00:42,992
(Jong Kook knows where his prey is headed.)

1569
01:00:44,392 --> 01:00:46,522
(The second place of hiding is...)

1570
01:00:46,522 --> 01:00:47,662
(the sewer.)

1571
01:00:47,662 --> 01:00:48,662
Hide.

1572
01:00:50,862 --> 01:00:52,522
(Where did you go?)

1573
01:00:53,722 --> 01:00:55,622
(You won't be able to find me.)

1574
01:00:56,492 --> 01:00:59,092
(Lady Seul Hye is on a search as well.)

1575
01:00:59,092 --> 01:01:01,462
(He's determined not to get caught.)

1576
01:01:03,822 --> 01:01:04,992
His foot's coming off.

1577
01:01:04,992 --> 01:01:07,522
(Servant Su Won has reached his limit.)

1578
01:01:07,522 --> 01:01:08,522
Haha.

1579
01:01:08,822 --> 01:01:10,262
It's not off.

1580
01:01:10,262 --> 01:01:11,892
(If he fails this mission, they'll run out of time to attack.)

1581
01:01:11,892 --> 01:01:15,022
(Which servant will last longer?)

1582
01:01:15,022 --> 01:01:16,022
Oh, gosh.

1583
01:01:16,022 --> 01:01:20,762
(Her stamina is plummeting as the race continues.)

1584
01:01:20,762 --> 01:01:23,292
(I just need to hold on for just a little longer.)

1585
01:01:25,662 --> 01:01:29,522
(Jong Kook predicted Jae Jin's route.)

1586
01:01:29,522 --> 01:01:31,522
(He got spotted.)

1587
01:01:33,422 --> 01:01:35,762
Seul Hye!

1588
01:01:35,762 --> 01:01:37,522
(Over here, Lady.)

1589
01:01:37,522 --> 01:01:40,062
Over here! Seul Hye!

1590
01:01:40,422 --> 01:01:42,862
(This is a brutal sight.)

1591
01:01:42,862 --> 01:01:45,522
(I can't get caught like this.)

1592
01:01:45,522 --> 01:01:47,892
I got him.

1593
01:01:48,022 --> 01:01:49,022
Where is he?

1594
01:01:49,022 --> 01:01:50,462
(Thanks to Servant Jong Kook's hard work,)

1595
01:01:50,462 --> 01:01:52,092
(Jae Jin is out.)

1596
01:01:52,092 --> 01:01:55,022
We got him.

1597
01:01:55,092 --> 01:01:56,262
Are you okay?

1598
01:01:57,362 --> 01:01:58,362
(I guess this is the end.)

1599
01:01:58,362 --> 01:02:00,092
Let me get that.

1600
01:02:00,092 --> 01:02:01,292
You hid really well though.

1601
01:02:01,292 --> 01:02:02,292
Good job.

1602
01:02:03,422 --> 01:02:04,892
I almost couldn't find you.

1603
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:06,862
Why did I get caught?

1604
01:02:06,992 --> 01:02:09,392
- How did you know? - I didn't.

1605
01:02:10,362 --> 01:02:14,222
(At the same moment, Su Won's mission came to an end.)

1606
01:02:14,222 --> 01:02:17,462
(The last mission is over.)

1607
01:02:17,462 --> 01:02:18,462
- Did Seok Jin win? - You did good.

1608
01:02:18,462 --> 01:02:20,522
- Seok Jin won, right? - You did good.

1609
01:02:20,522 --> 01:02:21,722
(Team Seul Hye's turn to attack is over.)

1610
01:02:22,192 --> 01:02:24,462
The attack is over.

1611
01:02:24,462 --> 01:02:27,292
(Knock, knock. Anyone there?)

1612
01:02:27,292 --> 01:02:30,292
(Is it over?)

1613
01:02:31,662 --> 01:02:33,192
(Servant Ji Won managed to survive until the end.)

1614
01:02:33,192 --> 01:02:34,462
I couldn't hear you in there.

1615
01:02:35,662 --> 01:02:36,662
(Only Jae Duck and Ji Won remain.)

1616
01:02:36,662 --> 01:02:39,762
(4 people are out with only 2 remaining.)

1617
01:02:40,222 --> 01:02:42,522
- We have to win this one. - I know.

1618
01:02:42,522 --> 01:02:44,692
It's all your fault.

1619
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:46,862
You're out, too.

1620
01:02:46,922 --> 01:02:49,522
- Why is everything my fault? - You got me out.

1621
01:02:49,522 --> 01:02:50,722
(It's always your fault.)

1622
01:02:51,962 --> 01:02:53,762
Kwang Soo is the food thief for sure.

1623
01:02:53,822 --> 01:02:55,592
I understand why you might think that,

1624
01:02:55,722 --> 01:02:57,722
but I went all the way into the woods not to get caught.

1625
01:02:58,722 --> 01:03:00,992
It's time for Team Seul Hye's...

1626
01:03:01,092 --> 01:03:02,162
defence.

1627
01:03:02,722 --> 01:03:04,192
Where are you going to hide?

1628
01:03:04,192 --> 01:03:05,192
Where did they hide last time?

1629
01:03:05,192 --> 01:03:07,892
- They were gathered over there. - We should go into the woods.

1630
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:09,692
We should hide somewhere where nobody can find us.

1631
01:03:10,222 --> 01:03:12,822
(If more than 2 people survive, Team Seul Hye wins.)

1632
01:03:14,022 --> 01:03:17,092
We have to catch more than five, Jae Jin.

1633
01:03:17,092 --> 01:03:18,362
Don't worry, Jae Seok.

1634
01:03:18,622 --> 01:03:20,222
Don't care about Jong Kook.

1635
01:03:20,222 --> 01:03:21,222
- Let's go! - You know what I mean, right?

1636
01:03:21,222 --> 01:03:23,022
I'll make a monkey sound if I spot someone.

1637
01:03:23,022 --> 01:03:24,022
How?

1638
01:03:24,022 --> 01:03:26,092
(He imitates a monkey.)

1639
01:03:26,092 --> 01:03:27,092
I see.

1640
01:03:27,622 --> 01:03:29,092
Can't you just call us over like a normal human being?

1641
01:03:29,092 --> 01:03:31,192
You could just say, "Over here!"

1642
01:03:31,192 --> 01:03:32,662
Just call her over.

1643
01:03:32,662 --> 01:03:34,092
Just a suggestion.

1644
01:03:34,092 --> 01:03:36,192
Doesn't the monkey sound just give away where you are?

1645
01:03:36,822 --> 01:03:38,662
(Let me do this my way.)

1646
01:03:38,662 --> 01:03:40,092
Just do as you like, Jae Jin.

1647
01:03:40,262 --> 01:03:42,622
If we don't manage to win,

1648
01:03:42,622 --> 01:03:44,522
- everything will come to nothing. - We can do this.

1649
01:03:44,522 --> 01:03:45,892
We can do this.

1650
01:03:46,462 --> 01:03:49,392
(Ji Hyo and Jae Jin have to catch them while others are on missions.)

1651
01:03:49,622 --> 01:03:51,762
("Toy Hammer with My Lady")

1652
01:03:51,762 --> 01:03:57,362
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1653
01:03:57,562 --> 01:03:58,562
Start!

1654
01:04:00,262 --> 01:04:03,622
(Jae Seok sits on a cone as they start.)

1655
01:04:03,622 --> 01:04:04,992
(He's in pain.)

1656
01:04:05,762 --> 01:04:06,822
Oh, goodness.

1657
01:04:07,922 --> 01:04:11,422
(The pain doubles and triples.)

1658
01:04:12,822 --> 01:04:14,492
(He can't stand it any more.)

1659
01:04:14,492 --> 01:04:15,562
What are you doing?

1660
01:04:15,562 --> 01:04:16,822
Already?

1661
01:04:16,822 --> 01:04:18,622
It almost went in.

1662
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:20,292
I'm sorry about this.

1663
01:04:20,292 --> 01:04:22,822
- That was close. - This is too hard.

1664
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:24,092
It almost came out of your neck.

1665
01:04:24,092 --> 01:04:25,392
I know.

1666
01:04:27,022 --> 01:04:28,522
This is difficult.

1667
01:04:28,522 --> 01:04:29,762
(Jae Duck is up next after Jae Seok.)

1668
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:33,392
(Please hold on, my fellow servants.)

1669
01:04:36,822 --> 01:04:38,422
(He spots a prey.)

1670
01:04:38,422 --> 01:04:39,462
There's one over there.

1671
01:04:39,462 --> 01:04:42,992
(Who's the first person they found?)

1672
01:04:43,822 --> 01:04:47,622
(It's Seok Jin, of course.)

1673
01:04:47,622 --> 01:04:48,622
What?

1674
01:04:49,522 --> 01:04:51,092
(He runs after him.)

1675
01:04:52,022 --> 01:04:53,022
Who is that?

1676
01:04:55,092 --> 01:04:56,392
(A monkey is coming after me.)

1677
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:59,092
Jae Duck. Wait, it's Jae Jin.

1678
01:04:59,092 --> 01:05:01,292
(Jae Jin will lure him towards Ji Hyo.)

1679
01:05:01,292 --> 01:05:02,422
You don't have the hammer.

1680
01:05:03,492 --> 01:05:04,492
(He tries to escape.)

1681
01:05:05,922 --> 01:05:07,222
(I'm too tired now.)

1682
01:05:08,262 --> 01:05:10,092
(Seok Jin gets caught.)

1683
01:05:10,092 --> 01:05:11,092
Sorry, Seok Jin.

1684
01:05:11,092 --> 01:05:12,722
- Don't be. - We got him.

1685
01:05:12,722 --> 01:05:14,392
(Seok Jin is out.)

1686
01:05:14,622 --> 01:05:17,092
(His work is done today.)

1687
01:05:18,062 --> 01:05:20,762
(While Ji Hyo and Jae Jin are working their strategy...)

1688
01:05:20,762 --> 01:05:23,022
You can do it, Jae Duck.

1689
01:05:23,622 --> 01:05:25,222
Jae Duck's in the zone.

1690
01:05:25,562 --> 01:05:26,992
He's about to break the world record.

1691
01:05:27,092 --> 01:05:28,392
This could go in the Guinness Book of Records.

1692
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:29,822
Give them a call right now.

1693
01:05:29,822 --> 01:05:31,092
I'm sorry, but could I have some water?

1694
01:05:31,092 --> 01:05:33,022
You can drink water while doing that?

1695
01:05:33,022 --> 01:05:35,222
- Give me some water. - This is good.

1696
01:05:35,322 --> 01:05:36,922
Call the people of Guinness Book of Records.

1697
01:05:36,922 --> 01:05:39,422
- I wonder if I can do this. - Don't go too close.

1698
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:41,722
(Thanks to Jae Duck's great work,)

1699
01:05:41,722 --> 01:05:42,722
(Sung Hoon gets caught.)

1700
01:05:42,722 --> 01:05:43,922
Why is he so good?

1701
01:05:43,922 --> 01:05:44,922
(Meanwhile, Sung Hoon is caught.)

1702
01:05:46,562 --> 01:05:49,522
There you go. Throw the bottle away.

1703
01:05:49,522 --> 01:05:50,522
(I've still got it.)

1704
01:05:52,092 --> 01:05:53,622
- Is this a talent show? - I can do this.

1705
01:05:53,922 --> 01:05:55,362
Way to go.

1706
01:05:55,362 --> 01:05:57,262
(While everyone is trying their best to achieve victory...)

1707
01:06:00,322 --> 01:06:02,622
(He's thinking.)

1708
01:06:04,592 --> 01:06:06,392
I don't need to win today, though.

1709
01:06:07,392 --> 01:06:09,262
I just need to do the mission, right?

1710
01:06:10,992 --> 01:06:14,192
(10 minutes ago, the food thief saw the staff members in secret.)

1711
01:06:16,662 --> 01:06:18,022
I can't do that.

1712
01:06:18,022 --> 01:06:19,192
(The last mission is hitting Jong Kook in the back of his head.)

1713
01:06:19,622 --> 01:06:23,262
(He will get 100 bags of Icheon rice if he succeeds this mission.)

1714
01:06:23,262 --> 01:06:26,392
(The person he has to do the mission on...)

1715
01:06:26,392 --> 01:06:30,822
(is the man who only lives on chicken breasts.)

1716
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:34,492
Should I just get myself caught?

1717
01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:37,892
(Why aren't they after me?)

1718
01:06:41,522 --> 01:06:46,592
(There's a monkey wandering around to catch his prey.)

1719
01:06:46,592 --> 01:06:50,662
(This mountain monkey is after balloons filled with flour.)

1720
01:06:54,292 --> 01:06:55,992
(He's a monkey who wants to be...)

1721
01:06:55,992 --> 01:06:59,992
(the leopard of Icheon.)

1722
01:07:00,692 --> 01:07:02,392
(The monkey is lurking around.)

1723
01:07:02,392 --> 01:07:04,422
Did you catch any, Jae Jin?

1724
01:07:05,822 --> 01:07:08,722
(It smells like servants.)

1725
01:07:08,722 --> 01:07:10,392
There's no time.

1726
01:07:11,092 --> 01:07:12,192
(He hears something.)

1727
01:07:16,392 --> 01:07:17,722
(The monkey cries again.)

1728
01:07:19,322 --> 01:07:20,662
(I hear a monkey.)

1729
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:22,322
I hear the monkey!

1730
01:07:22,322 --> 01:07:24,422
(The monkey finds a prey.)

1731
01:07:24,422 --> 01:07:26,462
(It's Haha.)

1732
01:07:26,462 --> 01:07:27,822
Hold on, Jae Jin.

1733
01:07:27,822 --> 01:07:30,022
- You were hiding in there? - Calm down.

1734
01:07:30,222 --> 01:07:32,692
- Haha. - How did you know I was in here?

1735
01:07:32,762 --> 01:07:35,022
- Let me hit you. - You're amazing.

1736
01:07:35,592 --> 01:07:36,822
(Ji Hyo and Jae Jin are perfect partners.)

1737
01:07:36,822 --> 01:07:38,522
- I'll come down. - You're stalling, aren't you?

1738
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:39,522
(Ji Hyo and Jae Jin are perfect partners.)

1739
01:07:41,462 --> 01:07:42,462
(The balloon pops.)

1740
01:07:42,922 --> 01:07:43,922
(Haha is out.)

1741
01:07:43,922 --> 01:07:44,922
Is it over now?

1742
01:07:46,622 --> 01:07:48,092
How did they know I was in there?

1743
01:07:48,862 --> 01:07:51,262
(The monkey is on a rampage.)

1744
01:07:51,622 --> 01:07:52,792
There he is!

1745
01:07:54,522 --> 01:07:56,722
(Running)

1746
01:07:58,222 --> 01:08:01,022
(You can't outrun...)

1747
01:08:01,022 --> 01:08:04,262
(a monkey.)

1748
01:08:05,062 --> 01:08:07,592
(Energetic Jae Jin fiercely chases after Su Won.)

1749
01:08:07,592 --> 01:08:08,992
Great! You almost got him!

1750
01:08:08,992 --> 01:08:10,092
- You got him! - You made it!

1751
01:08:10,762 --> 01:08:12,322
- Who is it? - It's Su Won.

1752
01:08:12,722 --> 01:08:14,662
Great. Go, Ji Hyo!

1753
01:08:15,022 --> 01:08:16,592
Ji Hyo!

1754
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:18,022
- Great job. - Isn't it over?

1755
01:08:18,022 --> 01:08:19,462
- Done! - It's Ji Hyo.

1756
01:08:19,522 --> 01:08:20,762
(Ji Hyo pops the balloon.)

1757
01:08:20,762 --> 01:08:22,232
(Su Won is out.)

1758
01:08:22,232 --> 01:08:24,392
Ji Hyo! Ji Hyo!

1759
01:08:24,462 --> 01:08:26,492
Ji Hyo! Great.

1760
01:08:26,492 --> 01:08:28,062
- We made it! - I have a cramp.

1761
01:08:29,462 --> 01:08:30,762
We have one more to go.

1762
01:08:30,762 --> 01:08:33,862
(If Team Ji Hyo catches one more, they win.)

1763
01:08:34,392 --> 01:08:36,362
(I have a bad feeling right now.)

1764
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:38,592
(They are waiting in ambush.)

1765
01:08:38,692 --> 01:08:41,822
(A team running out of time versus a team wanted by a monkey)

1766
01:08:42,022 --> 01:08:44,962
(Ji Hyo is near the hole in which Seul Hye is hiding.)

1767
01:08:44,962 --> 01:08:47,022
(She hears the bells.)

1768
01:08:48,092 --> 01:08:52,962
(Will Seul Hye be caught by Ji Hyo?)

1769
01:08:55,492 --> 01:08:56,662
(Ji Hyo passes by.)

1770
01:08:56,662 --> 01:08:58,422
(Ji Hyo misses Seul Hye.)

1771
01:08:58,762 --> 01:09:02,062
(She's scared to death.)

1772
01:09:02,822 --> 01:09:04,562
(Jae Duck's hula hoop show is over.)

1773
01:09:04,562 --> 01:09:06,862
- It hurts. - You're doing just fine.

1774
01:09:07,292 --> 01:09:08,762
- It hurts. - It's all right.

1775
01:09:08,762 --> 01:09:10,232
- It's okay. You can do it. - With this...

1776
01:09:10,232 --> 01:09:12,862
I learned some magic from the internet.

1777
01:09:12,862 --> 01:09:14,562
- What is it? - Come here and take a look.

1778
01:09:14,562 --> 01:09:16,262
(Seok Jin is curious.)

1779
01:09:16,262 --> 01:09:17,362
- And? - Now, look inside.

1780
01:09:18,562 --> 01:09:20,522
(Drenched)

1781
01:09:20,762 --> 01:09:22,692
Jae Seok, good job!

1782
01:09:22,792 --> 01:09:25,262
Thank you so much, Jae Seok!

1783
01:09:25,262 --> 01:09:27,062
(I can't get mad here, right?)

1784
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:30,592
- Jae Seok, that was so helpful. - Really?

1785
01:09:30,592 --> 01:09:32,962
You're right. This helps you endure longer.

1786
01:09:32,992 --> 01:09:36,522
Isn't it funny? I saw this on the internet.

1787
01:09:36,522 --> 01:09:37,822
I think I'll be frostbitten.

1788
01:09:37,822 --> 01:09:40,262
- You won't. That's not true. - No way.

1789
01:09:40,692 --> 01:09:42,492
(What do you mean it's not true?)

1790
01:09:42,492 --> 01:09:43,492
Really?

1791
01:09:43,562 --> 01:09:45,392
(The last runner Kwang Soo will try Leg Split.)

1792
01:09:45,392 --> 01:09:46,492
Kwang Soo, let me hold it.

1793
01:09:47,162 --> 01:09:48,262
(This is the best mission for the tall Kwang Soo.)

1794
01:09:48,262 --> 01:09:49,322
- Good luck. - Okay.

1795
01:09:50,062 --> 01:09:51,992
I'm sure he'll make it. Good.

1796
01:09:52,322 --> 01:09:53,322
Wow, Kwang Soo.

1797
01:09:54,292 --> 01:09:56,592
(If he gives up, the time is up.)

1798
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:57,592
Did you find anything?

1799
01:09:57,892 --> 01:10:00,392
(Where on earth are they hiding?)

1800
01:10:00,392 --> 01:10:01,562
This is a dead end.

1801
01:10:02,062 --> 01:10:05,592
(I'm right here in front of you.)

1802
01:10:06,092 --> 01:10:07,462
(Will she be able to survive?)

1803
01:10:07,462 --> 01:10:09,822
(Or will they be able to find her?)

1804
01:10:09,822 --> 01:10:12,262
(Or will they hold out until the time runs out?)

1805
01:10:13,362 --> 01:10:16,592
(How much longer should I stay here?)

1806
01:10:20,092 --> 01:10:23,192
(Here comes the hunting duo.)

1807
01:10:23,322 --> 01:10:25,922
(I found her!)

1808
01:10:26,562 --> 01:10:28,322
(He makes monkey sounds.)

1809
01:10:28,522 --> 01:10:31,662
(That sound is creepier than the bell sound.)

1810
01:10:31,662 --> 01:10:33,092
Where is she? What's going on?

1811
01:10:34,162 --> 01:10:36,292
What happened? Where are you?

1812
01:10:36,422 --> 01:10:38,092
- Gosh! - Did you get her?

1813
01:10:38,792 --> 01:10:40,862
When does the time run out?

1814
01:10:41,322 --> 01:10:43,892
I thought time would be up if I stayed here like this.

1815
01:10:44,092 --> 01:10:45,232
Turn around.

1816
01:10:45,592 --> 01:10:47,822
I'm sorry, Seul Hye.

1817
01:10:48,922 --> 01:10:51,992
(Another balloon bursts.)

1818
01:10:51,992 --> 01:10:53,092
The flour is all over me.

1819
01:10:53,092 --> 01:10:55,462
(Seul Hye is out as well.)

1820
01:10:55,562 --> 01:10:58,322
(What a scary pair.)

1821
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:01,362
Team Ji Hyo won...

1822
01:11:01,422 --> 01:11:03,092
the last round.

1823
01:11:03,922 --> 01:11:05,462
Ji Hyo!

1824
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:08,662
- Ji Hyo and Jae Duck! - Jae Duck!

1825
01:11:08,662 --> 01:11:09,962
- No, it's Jae Jin. - Jae Jin.

1826
01:11:09,962 --> 01:11:11,522
- Kwang Soo. - Jae Duck.

1827
01:11:11,522 --> 01:11:12,822
You did a great job.

1828
01:11:13,022 --> 01:11:14,462
You were a perfect duo.

1829
01:11:14,462 --> 01:11:16,562
- It was terrific. - It was so...

1830
01:11:16,562 --> 01:11:17,822
(There's one person who's nervous.)

1831
01:11:17,822 --> 01:11:20,692
(It's the food thief, Su Won.)

1832
01:11:21,162 --> 01:11:22,592
I can't hit him.

1833
01:11:22,592 --> 01:11:24,922
(The last mission is to hit the back of Jong Kook's head.)

1834
01:11:24,922 --> 01:11:29,322
(I do not have much time left.)

1835
01:11:30,762 --> 01:11:32,992
(He's holding the toy hammer.)

1836
01:11:33,092 --> 01:11:34,562
Team Ji Hyo won this round.

1837
01:11:34,562 --> 01:11:38,492
(Now...)

1838
01:11:38,492 --> 01:11:41,322
(is...)

1839
01:11:41,322 --> 01:11:42,922
(the chance.)

1840
01:11:42,922 --> 01:11:44,192
- Ji Hyo! - Good job.

1841
01:11:45,022 --> 01:11:46,592
(Su Won hits Jong Kook.)

1842
01:11:47,232 --> 01:11:48,822
- They were so good. - Thank you.

1843
01:11:48,822 --> 01:11:51,092
(It's hard to read his face.)

1844
01:11:52,562 --> 01:11:54,862
- Good work. - He hit my head with this hammer.

1845
01:11:55,062 --> 01:11:56,662
He hit me and said, "Thank you".

1846
01:11:56,662 --> 01:11:58,462
What was that? Are you out of your mind?

1847
01:11:59,362 --> 01:12:01,422
I'm the food thief!

1848
01:12:01,762 --> 01:12:03,322
I'm the food thief!

1849
01:12:03,322 --> 01:12:09,192
(What? What on earth is going on here?)

1850
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:11,092
I'm the food thief!

1851
01:12:11,232 --> 01:12:12,292
What?

1852
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:15,062
It's not the time yet. Why did you make it public?

1853
01:12:15,232 --> 01:12:17,322
- It's Su Won. - Su Won!

1854
01:12:17,322 --> 01:12:18,562
(Poor Su Won, it's your mistake.)

1855
01:12:19,392 --> 01:12:21,822
- All right. - I think he confessed because...

1856
01:12:21,822 --> 01:12:23,522
he made a mistake earlier.

1857
01:12:23,562 --> 01:12:25,392
- That's not right. - Are you sure?

1858
01:12:25,392 --> 01:12:26,692
I think it's his mistake.

1859
01:12:26,692 --> 01:12:28,792
(He pretends to be a robot when things are unfavorable.)

1860
01:12:28,792 --> 01:12:30,422
- I think it's his mistake... - Look at Su Won.

1861
01:12:30,422 --> 01:12:32,022
He seems to feel bad now.

1862
01:12:32,022 --> 01:12:33,322
- That's not true. - He just sighed.

1863
01:12:33,322 --> 01:12:35,092
- Was it your mistake? - No, it wasn't.

1864
01:12:35,262 --> 01:12:37,022
The final winner...

1865
01:12:37,022 --> 01:12:38,622
It will be so funny if it's Su Won.

1866
01:12:38,622 --> 01:12:42,292
The winner of the Food Thief Race is Team Ji Hyo.

1867
01:12:42,292 --> 01:12:44,192
(Team Ji Hyo is the final winner.)

1868
01:12:44,192 --> 01:12:45,562
- And... - We did it.

1869
01:12:45,562 --> 01:12:50,232
I'm sure you were all curious about who the food thief was.

1870
01:12:50,892 --> 01:12:52,092
That thief was...

1871
01:12:52,092 --> 01:12:53,262
Su Won.

1872
01:12:53,262 --> 01:12:54,992
(Su Won was the food thief.)

1873
01:12:54,992 --> 01:12:56,092
What's wrong?

1874
01:12:56,092 --> 01:12:57,322
What is this?

1875
01:12:57,922 --> 01:12:59,462
- I won, right? - This is so funny.

1876
01:12:59,992 --> 01:13:01,862
Isn't he a spy sent by another broadcasting station?

1877
01:13:02,662 --> 01:13:04,092
"I'm the food thief!"

1878
01:13:04,522 --> 01:13:05,562
Why did you do that?

1879
01:13:06,392 --> 01:13:09,962
(What an innocent and child-like spy he is.)

1880
01:13:10,092 --> 01:13:11,422
Anyway,

1881
01:13:11,422 --> 01:13:15,462
the food thief, Su Won, succeeded his mission.

1882
01:13:15,462 --> 01:13:17,092
(He cleared his mission anyway.)

1883
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:18,962
Here's a golden rice bowl for you.

1884
01:13:19,022 --> 01:13:23,922
And we'll donate the 100 sacks of rice in your name.

1885
01:13:24,662 --> 01:13:26,662
- Great. - He's so charitable!

1886
01:13:27,092 --> 01:13:30,522
And we'll give you the premium rice grown in Icheon...

1887
01:13:30,522 --> 01:13:33,922
for the final winner, Team Ji Hyo.

1888
01:13:34,092 --> 01:13:35,322
I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

1889
01:13:35,622 --> 01:13:36,922
I didn't know it'd turn out this way.

1890
01:13:37,462 --> 01:13:39,592
I said it wasn't me!

1891
01:13:39,592 --> 01:13:41,562
I'm really sorry. It must've been a long day for you.

1892
01:13:41,562 --> 01:13:42,662
Goodness.

1893
01:13:42,662 --> 01:13:44,762
- I'm sorry that I misunderstood. - Me, too.

1894
01:13:44,762 --> 01:13:47,192
You can't just make such excuses this late!

1895
01:13:47,192 --> 01:13:49,262
- Did we stress you out? - Come on, Jae Seok.

1896
01:13:50,792 --> 01:13:53,232
Thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

1897
01:13:53,232 --> 01:13:57,262
(Thank you, Seul Hye and Sechs Kies, for being with us on this cold day.)

1900
01:14:04,422 --> 01:14:07,562
(This is the epitome of bromance.)

1901
01:14:07,562 --> 01:14:10,322
(Of course not!)

1902
01:14:10,892 --> 01:14:14,792
(They struggle to maintain their twisted bromance.)

1903
01:14:16,092 --> 01:14:21,592
(Guys fiercely compete to show their charms to win other guys' hearts.)

1904
01:14:21,692 --> 01:14:24,022
(Do not miss the amazing chemistry among these men.)
