1
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:07,519
(Seomun Market in Daegu)

2
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:12,349
(They have various kinds of tasty food.)

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,319
Is it only the four of us?

4
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:16,019
That's right.

5
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:18,519
- Jong Kook and... - It's very quiet.

6
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:19,989
- I know. - It's better.

7
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:22,519
- It's become much more peaceful. - Exactly.

8
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:23,719
- Right. - That's true.

9
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:25,449
I'm sure you feel lonely right now.

10
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:27,589
- Not at all. - What are you talking about?

11
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:29,619
We don't feel lonely at all.

12
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:31,419
- I like this better. - Today,

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,149
the main theme in the Bromance House.

14
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:34,389
The Bromance House?

15
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:37,889
Please come to the Bromance House to find the brothers.

16
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:40,389
That's where your bromance will grow.

17
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:42,089
- Do we have to find our brothers? - Our brothers?

18
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:43,989
Bromance...

19
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:45,689
(Who will they be?)

20
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:47,619
- I think... - My brother...

21
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:49,189
is like a superstar.

22
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:51,989
He is very wealthy.

23
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,719
Is your brother also rich?

24
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,249
- He is. - I see.

25
00:00:56,249 --> 00:00:58,489
He is quite wealthy.

26
00:00:58,819 --> 00:01:01,149
Why don't all of us have a cup of coffee?

27
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:02,349
Our brothers are very rich.

28
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:03,389
Let's order about 20 cups of coffee.

29
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:05,319
Hello.

30
00:01:05,889 --> 00:01:07,149
I'd like to order iced coffee.

31
00:01:07,889 --> 00:01:09,419
- We need 20. - I want 20 cups of coffee.

32
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,119
- Thank you. - We'll be in the next store.

33
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:14,089
Our brothers will come and pay for this.

34
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,949
Please come in. Don't worry. It's all free of charge.

35
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:18,949
- Thank you. - This is on my brother.

36
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:21,089
Sir, please have a bite.

37
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:22,719
Open wide.

38
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:26,889
(Please feel free to enjoy. Our brothers are superstars.)

39
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:28,419
(Thank you, our brothers.)

40
00:01:28,419 --> 00:01:30,389
- Our brothers will pay for this. - Right.

41
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:31,689
It's here.

42
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:32,789
(There they come.)

43
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:34,289
Hello.

44
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:36,189
- They are over there. - What are they doing?

45
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:39,249
(Let's see who Jae Seok and Kwang Soo's brothers are.)

46
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:41,319
My goodness.

47
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:43,319
(Jung Seok is Jae Seok's brother and Kyung Soo is Kwang Soo's brother.)

48
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,319
- Hello. - Hello, Kyung Soo.

49
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,019
(It's a dramatic reunion in Daegu.)

50
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:49,689
(You're having delicious food.)

51
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:50,989
What are you eating now?

52
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,019
- They're eating a lot of food. - Wait.

53
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:54,949
- Come have a seat. - Look what they have here.

54
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,449
We ordered these for everyone including the staff.

55
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:02,389
And you and Jae Seok must pay for these.

56
00:02:03,949 --> 00:02:05,619
- We should pay for this? - Exactly.

57
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:07,159
Jae Seok, he said it's all on us.

58
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,919
We need to pay?

59
00:02:09,089 --> 00:02:13,789
We both bragged about our wealthy brothers.

60
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:15,159
- Really? - Yes.

61
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:18,249
I can pay for this,

62
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:19,819
but I don't have my wallet with me.

63
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:21,159
Me neither.

64
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,189
- How much is it? - They didn't say I'd need money.

65
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:26,319
Actually, we brought your credit cards.

66
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,189
- What is that? - Wait.

67
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:30,159
(This is really my credit card.)

68
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,289
- Let me see. - This is really mine.

69
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:34,749
- What is this? - This is mine, too.

70
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:36,419
Your manager gave it to us.

71
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:38,549
Really? I lost this card quite a long time ago.

72
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:40,549
But the problem is...

73
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:41,549
- Did you really lose it? - Yes.

74
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:42,549
My credit limit...

75
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:45,089
I can spend only up to 80 dollars.

76
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:47,419
- Gosh. - Don't be ridiculous.

77
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:49,919
I lowered the limit in case I lose my card.

78
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,289
There's no card with an 80-dollar limit.

79
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:52,549
- So... - Yes?

80
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:54,389
- What? - Last time on Running Man,

81
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:57,789
I played that spaghetti game.

82
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:00,549
- I had to cut the pasta noodle... - I remember.

83
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:02,989
- as short as I could. - I think we'll win this game.

84
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:04,649
Aren't you shy, Kyung Soo?

85
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,989
We do such things often.

86
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,819
Yesterday, we kissed each other goodbye as well.

87
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,519
I know Kyung Soo well since we shoot a show together,

88
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:14,089
- and he's really shy. - Right.

89
00:03:14,089 --> 00:03:15,789
Right. He's a man.

90
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:17,889
Kyung Soo is more shy than people think.

91
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:19,589
Why are you all flushed?

92
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:22,489
- You said we had a kiss. - He's really red.

93
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,189
I'm not sure if I can do this.

94
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:27,049
Isn't it a game people usually play right after they meet each other?

95
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:28,249
You're right.

96
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,289
- Then start. - This is...

97
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:39,689
(Jung Seok bravely moves toward Jae Seok's pouted lips.)

98
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:44,449
(He's embarrassed.)

99
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:48,819
(This is the ideal bromance.)

100
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:51,519
I'm eating now. That's so gross.

101
00:03:52,719 --> 00:04:00,719
(It's only 2cm to Jae Seok's lips.)

102
00:04:01,249 --> 00:04:03,419
(Can I get closer?)

103
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:04,419
Oh, boy!

104
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:07,089
Do you have to do that?

105
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:09,889
You did a good job. It was nice.

106
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:13,049
Jung Seok. We have good chemistry.

107
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,749
It was great.

108
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,249
- It's 1.2cm. - 1.2cm.

109
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:19,349
You just stay there. I'll come to you.

110
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:21,119
(It's Kyung Soo and Kwang Soo's turn.)

111
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:30,349
(Kyung Soo, just stay there. I'll come to you.)

112
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:31,519
(Too much pressure)

113
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,649
Kyung Soo. You cut the pasta.

114
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:36,519
You cut the pasta. Kyung Soo bit it off.

115
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,789
(No, our bromance is still in one piece.)

116
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:40,749
We kissed before parting.

117
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:42,389
(We kissed yesterday, too.)

118
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:43,689
You cut the pasta.

119
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:46,719
You cut the pasta. Kyung Soo bit it off.

120
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:48,049
- Kyung Soo bit it off. - Hey!

121
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:49,119
(We just kissed.)

122
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:51,019
Kyung Soo bit it off.

123
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:53,819
- Don't eat it. - Yes, that's it.

124
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:56,919
- Don't eat it. - Yes, that's it.

125
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,959
(I thought I ate it all. Where did that come from?)

126
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,149
Hang on.

127
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:02,189
- This is... - Listen.

128
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:04,089
Did that come out of his throat?

129
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:05,349
(Is it throat reflux?)

130
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:07,289
It's cheese. Stringy cheese.

131
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:08,649
- That's disgusting. - It's not.

132
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:11,719
- It's just cheese. Stringy cheese. - Stop it.

133
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:14,459
- This is a dinnertime show. - It's not gross.

134
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:16,459
- People will switch channels. - Did you have to turn me...

135
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:19,349
- into a disgusting person? - I had no choice.

136
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,489
- We could've won. - Gosh.

137
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:25,249
- Thanks for the food. - Thank you, Kwang Soo.

138
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:26,849
That's just for the food.

139
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:30,049
- You really did swipe my card. - Of course, they did.

140
00:05:30,049 --> 00:05:31,589
(It's the real-name transaction system.)

141
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:33,219
We drank coffee, too.

142
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:36,119
- How much was that? - That bill was separate.

143
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:37,549
Two coffees, right?

144
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:39,919
- We all had some. - 20 coffees.

145
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:42,549
- 20 cups of coffee. - Why?

146
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:45,589
You don't usually drink coffee.

147
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:48,149
Let's pick a number, number 1 or 2.

148
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:49,749
Do you want 1 or 2?

149
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:51,849
- I'll be number one. - Okay.

150
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:54,649
- Number 1 and you pay, 2 is me. - Okay.

151
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:56,689
- The coffee lady. - The coffee lady.

152
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,749
Which credit card do you want? Number 1 or number 2?

153
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,049
(Kwang Soo already spent a lot. Will he pay for the coffees, too?)

154
00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:05,589
Which credit card do you want? Number 1 or number 2?

155
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,689
- Number one. - Okay.

156
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:09,189
- Number one. - Okay.

157
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:11,749
(Would you like to think again?)

158
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:13,589
- Did she pick mine? - Yes.

159
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:14,589
Just a moment.

160
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:17,649
My credit card...

161
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,519
It's still warm from the previous swipe.

162
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,589
(It's still warm.)

163
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,749
The look on his face... His soul left his body.

164
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:26,589
Thank you, Kwang Soo.

165
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:28,619
- Thanks. - 72 dollars' worth of coffee?

166
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:29,749
Thank you.

167
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,589
You can afford to treat Jung Seok and Kyung Soo.

168
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:34,389
I feel great. I do.

169
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:37,449
- You can head to the set now. - Can we?

170
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:38,489
- Shall we go? - Yes.

171
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:40,749
- Let's go, Jung Seok. - Okay.

172
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:42,989
(This is the bromance hangout.)

173
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:49,689
(This is the Bromance House where boys become tight friends.)

174
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:52,819
It's empty. No one's here yet.

175
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:54,649
Seok Jin, I want this.

176
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:58,649
- You don't even need that. - I want one.

177
00:06:58,649 --> 00:06:59,689
Buy me this.

178
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:02,019
I will. I'll get you one.

179
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:04,689
- Sit down, Ji Hyo. - You want everything, don't you?

180
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:07,319
- You youngsters... - Sit down, Ji Hyo.

181
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,249
(This is my ugly, little brother.)

182
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:11,989
- Buy me this, too. - Hello.

183
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:13,689
Kyung Soo and Jung Seok are here.

184
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:17,449
Brother! Brother!

185
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:18,519
He's older.

186
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:20,619
Hello. How've you been?

187
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:21,749
Hello.

188
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:23,449
(Today's teams)

189
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:25,419
- How are you? - Thanks for coming.

190
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:26,889
Jung Seok.

191
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:29,289
Hello and welcome.

192
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,049
Please welcome Cho Jung Seok...

193
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,349
and D.O.

194
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:37,589
- Do Kyung Soo. - He plays a judo player.

195
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:39,889
- That's right. - "Jealousy Incarnate".

196
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:42,149
How should I react to that?

197
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,919
Jung Seok, I'm envious.

198
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:47,449
- You must be pleased. - Not him.

199
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:48,749
His girlfriend must be pleased.

200
00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:50,019
(He is the ideal boyfriend.)

201
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:51,519
- Good point. - You're right.

202
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:55,419
- You shot the movie "Brother". - Yes.

203
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:59,219
Today's race is about Bromance House and the friendship within.

204
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:01,549
Bromance? It's a trend.

205
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:05,619
Each team of two must do their best to avoid the final penalty.

206
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:08,189
- There's a penalty? - Only one team will go down.

207
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:12,519
Each team will complete a few, small missions...

208
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:16,689
and pick a total of four cards in the dealer room behind you.

209
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:21,389
There are eight different cards to choose from that come in pairs,

210
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:23,489
so that's a total of 16 cards.

211
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:26,989
Two of those 16 cards are Penalty Cards.

212
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:31,149
The team that fails to hand over the Penalty Cards to another team...

213
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:32,689
will pay the final penalty.

214
00:08:32,689 --> 00:08:34,289
Is it a serious penalty?

215
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:37,419
The losing team has to pay for the food...

216
00:08:37,689 --> 00:08:40,019
the staff ate with their own money.

217
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,849
- It's usually me. - That's...

218
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:42,989
That's Jong Kook's thing.

219
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:47,059
We're okay with that, but Kyung Soo and Jung Seok are guests.

220
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:49,619
- Do you have your credit card? - Not right now.

221
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:51,249
- Not right now? - No.

222
00:08:51,249 --> 00:08:53,189
You should pay for him.

223
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:55,559
- The elder usually pays. - He's doing well these days.

224
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,489
Come on. You're a superstar.

225
00:08:58,219 --> 00:09:00,219
- I'm proud to know you. - You're right.

226
00:09:00,219 --> 00:09:02,589
- I'm proud of you. - You were a superstar for years.

227
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:04,119
I'm pleased he's here.

228
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:06,289
- What about you, Kyung Soo? - I'm not sure.

229
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:07,989
- You aren't sure? - Don't back out.

230
00:09:07,989 --> 00:09:11,119
We'll send the bill to SM Entertainment.

231
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,349
They'll dock your pay.

232
00:09:13,349 --> 00:09:14,689
Get paid the rest.

233
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:16,559
Before we begin the actual game,

234
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,789
we'll do a little something to find out how each team gets along.

235
00:09:19,989 --> 00:09:23,149
The winner of this game will be given the opportunity...

236
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:25,449
to check one card before they take a pick.

237
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:26,849
- The winner of this? - Yes.

238
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:28,019
It'll improve the odds.

239
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,689
The two members of each team will sing a song together.

240
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,719
Extra points will be awarded...

241
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:37,189
to public displays of friendship and passion, so do your best.

242
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:40,989
- Jung Seok is an amazing singer. - He is.

243
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:42,719
Kyung Soo can sing as well.

244
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,849
- He's a singer. He's in EXO. - He can sing.

245
00:09:44,849 --> 00:09:47,449
- He and I both released albums. - I recorded an album.

246
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,589
- Me, too. - Don't forget Haha.

247
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,149
- Ji Hyo's a pretty good singer. - I can sing, too.

248
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:54,519
This is the moment

249
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:57,189
(My brother's a musical actor.)

250
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:59,219
That's not how you sing it.

251
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:01,349
- Stop it. - Isn't that it?

252
00:10:01,349 --> 00:10:03,819
- Let's pick the order. - Let's select the order.

253
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:05,819
Rock-paper-scissors is boring.

254
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:09,059
Let's pinch each other and the first to scream goes first.

255
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:10,449
Pinch the person next to you.

256
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:12,349
To the left?

257
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:14,589
- To the left? - I can't grab hold...

258
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:16,319
of Jong Kook's thigh.

259
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:18,249
I can't grab hold of any flesh.

260
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:20,349
It's impossible to pinch your leg.

261
00:10:20,349 --> 00:10:22,249
- It's really impossible. - Try again.

262
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:25,559
- Do something to let me pinch you. - It's so unfair.

263
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:27,749
How about pulling this?

264
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:29,849
(How about pulling sideburns?)

265
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:31,289
That really hurts.

266
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:32,619
(Instead of pinching?)

267
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:34,389
- That sounds like fun. - It stings.

268
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:35,819
- That should be fun. - Do that.

269
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:37,419
- Let's do that. - Sideburn-pulling.

270
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,449
- Do you mind? - The hair right here?

271
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:41,489
Do I get to pull Haha's sideburn?

272
00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:43,289
You can't pull anyone's.

273
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:45,819
(Why did you choose to sit there?)

274
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:48,589
There's no one to your right so just don't scream.

275
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:50,189
Come over here.

276
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,319
- Come on. - Grin and bear it.

277
00:10:52,849 --> 00:10:55,689
- Grin and bear it. - I'm scared for you.

278
00:10:56,049 --> 00:10:57,349
Jong Kook's pulling yours.

279
00:10:58,189 --> 00:10:59,289
(You shouldn't be laughing.)

280
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:00,549
- Jae Seok. - If mine comes off...

281
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:02,219
- What if it does? - Kwang Soo.

282
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:04,119
We need glue on standby.

283
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:05,289
The puller goes first.

284
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,549
You might have a bald spot right here.

285
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:09,219
Tell me if you pull anything out.

286
00:11:09,219 --> 00:11:11,689
Ji Hyo, tell me if you see him pull anything out.

287
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,019
Your sideburns are so soft.

288
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:16,149
- Don't do that. - Sorry.

289
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:17,919
- Let's take it slow. - One...

290
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,249
- Gradually pull harder. - On 1, 2, 3.

291
00:11:20,489 --> 00:11:23,349
(The sideburn-pulling commences.)

292
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:26,689
(It's coming slowly.)

293
00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:28,019
On 1, 2, 3.

294
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,349
(They feel it now.)

295
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:33,449
Okay.

296
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:35,619
(They're about to peel off each other's scalps.)

297
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:36,819
- I feel it. - Me, too.

298
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:38,089
- I feel it. - Me, too.

299
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:41,149
(They can't sit still.)

300
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:43,589
Why you...

301
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:47,519
(Jong Kook pulled too hard and Jae Seok's out.)

302
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:49,749
Stop it!

303
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:51,989
- Shoot. - I didn't pull hard.

304
00:11:51,989 --> 00:11:53,849
- That wasn't hard? - It wasn't.

305
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:55,889
- How was that... - Jae Seok's out.

306
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,489
Do I have to grin and bear it again?

307
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:00,289
- I want to pull someone's hair. - What for?

308
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:03,019
- I'm good at pulling hair. - I'll pull this side this time.

309
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:07,219
What difference does it make? Both sides hurt the same.

310
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:08,649
Good luck, Jung Seok.

311
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:11,489
Are you all ready? Get ready and go.

312
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:13,119
Get ready and go.

313
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:16,119
(Kwang Soo takes a deep breath.)

314
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:21,689
(Haha seems to be doing well.)

315
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:22,849
Why you...

316
00:12:22,849 --> 00:12:23,919
(Maybe not.)

317
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,289
- What? - I can't stand it anymore.

318
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:27,349
Did you see that?

319
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:29,619
Kyung Soo.

320
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:31,519
- It's no joke. - It's not painful.

321
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,619
Kwang Soo's still...

322
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,619
He pulls really hard!

323
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:38,289
- Then scream. - He pretends to be nice then pulls.

324
00:12:38,989 --> 00:12:40,019
Then scream.

325
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:41,449
(Two-faced Jung Seok)

326
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:44,549
- He pulls really hard! - Then scream.

327
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:45,989
Just scream.

328
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:48,519
- Let's switch hands this time. - Okay.

329
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:50,849
- In the other direction? - Like this?

330
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:53,749
- In the other direction? - Like this?

331
00:12:54,489 --> 00:12:57,049
What? What are you doing?

332
00:12:57,489 --> 00:12:58,689
What are you doing?

333
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:01,049
(Their friendship runs deep.)

334
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:04,749
Why... You're just here for one day, but I have to shoot tomorrow.

335
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:06,889
I like this combination. This should be fun.

336
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:09,149
This should be worth watching.

337
00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:12,189
- Now... - What?

338
00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:13,589
I'll just grab the sideburns.

339
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:15,349
Then hold it like this.

340
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:16,949
- Well done. - What did he do?

341
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:18,589
Beware of Kyung Soo.

342
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:20,149
(He's planning something.)

343
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:21,649
- Let's play. - Are you ready?

344
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:23,249
(Target acquired)

345
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:24,319
Go.

346
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:27,449
Go.

347
00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:30,819
(We sense a dogfight.)

348
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:33,049
Look.

349
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:34,349
(The giraffe's hunting the tiger.)

350
00:13:34,349 --> 00:13:36,549
I love this. Keep it up.

351
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,549
(It looks like Jung Seok's about to lose a bit of his scalp.)

352
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,519
That hurts. That really hurts.

353
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,089
(Jung Seok's out.)

354
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:49,549
You got Jung Seok. Well done.

355
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:52,419
- The switch worked. - Did you see that?

356
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:55,449
- Couldn't you have kept it in? - Kyung Soo's no joke.

357
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,049
Kyung Soo, you pretended not to care but you're really into this.

358
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:01,619
- He pulls really hard with a smile. - I saw that.

359
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:04,389
- He never changed his expression. - Are you ready?

360
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:06,689
- These two are fun to watch. - Don't forget Kyung Soo.

361
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:08,519
- He's always smiling. - He's good.

362
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:10,789
- He has this poker face. - He's scary.

363
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:12,689
- Don't scream, Kyung Soo. - Ready?

364
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:14,389
Go.

365
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:15,449
(Round 3)

366
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:16,549
Go.

367
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:18,049
(Screaming)

368
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:20,949
(He screamed as soon as the game began.)

369
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:22,649
(Is my skin still intact?)

370
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:23,789
What?

371
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:25,719
- He pulls like... - I know, right?

372
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:27,419
- Like what? - We all felt it.

373
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:28,519
Well done.

374
00:14:28,849 --> 00:14:30,189
Why are we playing this game?

375
00:14:30,189 --> 00:14:31,289
Kyung Soo doesn't even flinch.

376
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:33,149
What is this game?

377
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:34,419
(Why are they so competitive?)

378
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:35,989
- You have to pull hard, Kyung Soo. - It already hurts.

379
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:37,689
- He's really good at this game. - Ready.

380
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:39,349
(I'm sorry, but I have to do this, Jong Kook.)

381
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:42,649
(Get back at him for me, Kyung Soo.)

382
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,089
Ready, set, go!

383
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:47,449
(Screaming)

384
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:49,789
(He couldn't get Kwang Soo's revenge on Jong Kook.)

385
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,419
Hey! You were almost there.

386
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:53,049
You were almost there.

387
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:54,449
- Jong Kook is so strong. - It really hurts, though.

388
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:56,419
- How is Ji Hyo doing it? - Ji Hyo is amazing.

389
00:14:56,419 --> 00:14:58,649
Ji Hyo's side hair is about to peel off.

390
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,419
- It really hurts. - I know.

391
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:02,319
How are we the last two remaining?

392
00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:04,119
One, two, three.

393
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:08,149
(The final match is between Ji Hyo and Jong Kook.)

394
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:09,519
Look at Ji Hyo.

395
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,289
- How is she taking it so well? - I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

396
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:16,189
(Will-power versus tiger claws)

397
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:18,619
- Oh, gosh. - Don't give up, Ji Hyo.

398
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:20,049
(She can't take it anymore.)

399
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:23,049
(Why does it hurt so much?)

400
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:24,619
- Ji Hyo. - It hurts so much.

401
00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:26,789
I did it.

402
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:27,949
- I did it. - He's such a...

403
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:30,089
- Oh, gosh. - I'm sick of him.

404
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:33,349
- I'm so sick of you. - Ji Hyo's skin is about to peel.

405
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,349
- Gosh. - You sounded like you're swearing.

406
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:37,619
I won!

407
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:39,219
(Seok Jin and Jong Kook get to choose the order of the songs.)

408
00:15:39,219 --> 00:15:40,989
Jong Kook is definitely my brother.

409
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:42,319
Ji Hyo did really well, though.

410
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,849
Which one do you want to listen to first?

411
00:15:43,849 --> 00:15:45,489
- "This is the Moment". - Let's do that.

412
00:15:45,489 --> 00:15:47,049
- You'll go first. - Is it our turn?

413
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:48,989
- Get up there. - That's our song.

414
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:51,719
- That's Jung Seok's song, isn't it? - Let's see how good it is.

415
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:53,689
I want to hear you sing.

416
00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:54,989
You looked cool singing that song.

417
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:56,419
You have to do it.

418
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,149
You have to sing for us to get a high score.

419
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:01,119
- Here we go. - Gosh.

420
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:02,319
What's going on here?

421
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:03,549
Listen to our song.

422
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:05,619
- What are you doing? - Can't you see a singer on stage?

423
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:06,849
- I know that. - This is the moment

424
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:09,819
(This is the moment, this is the day)

425
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:11,089
- This is the day - He's got that special something.

426
00:16:11,489 --> 00:16:12,689
Can you put the microphone down, Jae Seok?

427
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:14,589
- Be quiet. - Stay seated, Jae Seok.

428
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:15,889
And demons on their way

429
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:17,649
(I want to sing, too.)

430
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:19,919
You're going to sing the chorus, aren't you? Take his microphone.

431
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:22,589
This is nice.

432
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:26,389
(Jung Seok's sweet voice fills up the Bromance House.)

433
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:33,119
(Is coming into play, is here and now, today)

434
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:35,089
(Your turn, Jae Seok.)

435
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:38,689
This is the moment

436
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:43,319
(Jae Seok is about to ruin this perfect performance.)

437
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:47,119
When the momentum and the moment are in rhyme

438
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:48,789
(It's hard to sing seriously.)

439
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:51,049
- Give me this moment - Give me this moment

440
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:57,089
(Jung Seok doesn't mind the disturbance.)

441
00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:00,689
(This is how a singer should be.)

442
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:01,919
Let's go!

443
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:05,149
(Get lost, Grasshopper.)

444
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,789
(Let me go.)

445
00:17:08,389 --> 00:17:13,519
(All the dreaming, scheming, and screaming become one)

446
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,649
(They're screaming over here.)

447
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:18,549
(This is the day, see it sparkle and shine)

448
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:19,759
Can you give us your microphone?

449
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,889
When all I've lived for becomes mine

450
00:17:27,389 --> 00:17:29,049
(He hasn't given up just yet.)

451
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:34,259
(Jung Seok's voice captivates the hearts of men and women.)

452
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:39,119
To prove to them I've made it on my own

453
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:47,889
(This is the moment, my final test)

454
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:52,819
(Destiny beckoned, I never reckoned)

455
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,149
(It's a magical moment.)

456
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:59,719
(He sings passionately.)

457
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:08,149
(The sweetest moment of them all)

458
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:11,149
(He tries to take a part at the climax of the song.)

459
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:13,719
(He's stopped.)

460
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:20,019
(Can I sing just one note?)

461
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:28,219
(When I look back, I will always recall)

462
00:18:28,219 --> 00:18:34,319
(Moment for moment, this was the moment)

463
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:41,519
(The greatest moment of them all)

464
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:46,489
(We love you.)

465
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:51,419
(His singing makes a variety show feel like a musical.)

466
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,489
Cho Jung Seok. Cho Jung Seok.

467
00:18:54,489 --> 00:18:56,889
(You're the best, my brother.)

468
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,949
- What's his score? - What's the score?

469
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:01,689
- It's 86. - What?

470
00:19:01,689 --> 00:19:03,789
- Are you kidding me? - He wasn't his best himself.

471
00:19:03,789 --> 00:19:06,049
What happened?

472
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:07,289
How is this possible?

473
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:08,889
There will be bonus points you can earn.

474
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:11,819
- This doesn't make sense. - They got 86.

475
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:13,419
- I tried my best. - You did very well.

476
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,719
(A mere machine can't grade the true value of his performance.)

477
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:17,149
- He's got that something. - He looked so cool.

478
00:19:17,149 --> 00:19:18,319
- I think we lost already. - He was really good.

479
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,419
- Kyung Soo. Kyung Soo. - This is the moment

480
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:24,919
(Jung Seok left a lasting impression.)

481
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,389
- What are you going to sing? - We picked...

482
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:28,419
- "I Miss You" by Kim Bum Soo. - Really?

483
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,919
Please. Why are you doing this?

484
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,049
- Come on. - That's what you want to sing.

485
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:34,759
- What? - Let Kyung Soo decide.

486
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:36,049
We have the same taste in music.

487
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,719
Please don't sing that song.

488
00:19:37,989 --> 00:19:39,519
- Does he sing it all the time? - What's wrong?

489
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:41,689
What's with this reaction?

490
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:43,089
- Just sing it. - Don't do it.

491
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:45,589
- He has a thing for ballad songs. - Whom do you miss exactly?

492
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:47,319
- I like that song. - Who is it?

493
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:49,789
What about it?

494
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,149
I like it, too.

495
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,789
Whom are you missing?

496
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:56,689
- We'll give it a try. - Go on.

497
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:59,489
- This is a good song. - Don't get immersed in the song.

498
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,889
Stop it.

499
00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:03,289
(The actor brothers immerse themselves in emotion.)

500
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:04,549
Where's your bottom, Kwang Soo?

501
00:20:06,189 --> 00:20:07,419
Did you leave it at home?

502
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:13,889
(They missed the very first verse.)

503
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:15,589
I think they failed already.

504
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:17,149
(They should be disqualified.)

505
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,449
- Like a fool - He's good.

506
00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:23,349
(At this moment, he isn't an actor, but the lead vocalist of EXO.)

507
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,219
- That voice. - He's so good.

508
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:27,219
(She's happy.)

509
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:31,649
(Kwang Soo looks like the lead vocal judging by the facial expressions.)

510
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:37,119
(Kyung Soo sings with a sorrowful voice.)

511
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,889
- Why are you singing along? - This isn't your part.

512
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:46,089
(Kwang Soo sings with a pitiful voice.)

513
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:50,889
(He's very into it.)

514
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:52,319
(Stop it.)

515
00:20:53,949 --> 00:20:55,689
(Can we listen to Kyung Soo sing?)

516
00:20:56,589 --> 00:21:02,089
(I want to cry, kneel down for me)

517
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:07,549
(If it turns out there's nothing we can do about it)

518
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:13,349
(The others are being mischievous.)

519
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:15,949
(They have no idea of what is going on.)

520
00:21:17,689 --> 00:21:19,349
(Approaching)

521
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:23,349
(You didn't see this coming, did you?)

522
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:30,019
(Keep disturbing us. We'll just get more emotional.)

523
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:35,689
(They're singing their lungs out.)

524
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:42,589
(People could listen to Kyung Soo's sweet voice all day.)

525
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:45,759
(And...)

526
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,649
(people would want to stop listening to Kwang Soo's voice.)

527
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:50,389
- Eat it. - Swallow it.

528
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:52,049
What's wrong?

529
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:54,149
Here it is.

530
00:21:54,989 --> 00:21:56,919
(Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo scored 88 points.)

531
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:57,989
We got 88.

532
00:21:57,989 --> 00:21:59,389
- How is that possible? - How did they do that?

533
00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:00,749
"Did You See?" by Jeong Sam.

534
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:02,889
- Jeong Sam. - Let's go.

535
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,749
I wish you a pleasant evening.

536
00:22:05,389 --> 00:22:06,449
This one is called, "Did You See?"

537
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:10,219
I put my heart into this song.

538
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:12,019
(What's going on here?)

539
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:13,689
One, two, three, four.

540
00:22:13,689 --> 00:22:15,319
(Did you see? Did you see?)

541
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:19,089
(Why are we the ones embarrassed?)

542
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:22,549
(Is this how variety shows are like?)

543
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:26,219
(Trust your man)

544
00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:28,649
(I want to say something, but I won't.)

545
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:30,219
This is how I feel.

546
00:22:30,219 --> 00:22:31,519
What score did you get?

547
00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:33,119
- 88. - Not bad.

548
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:35,649
- We're tied. - That was the best.

549
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:38,119
The look on Kyung Soo's face was hilarious.

550
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,449
Kyung Soo was like this.

551
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:41,119
(What's wrong with that old man?)

552
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,819
- In the end, he was like this. - You were?

553
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,919
- You were like that? - Kyung Soo must've felt like...

554
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:47,749
he saw his uncle singing at a karaoke bar...

555
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:50,819
on holiday season.

556
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:51,919
A drunk uncle.

557
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:54,119
He was looking at him with pity.

558
00:22:54,349 --> 00:22:57,019
He was probably thinking, "I want to go home."

559
00:22:57,489 --> 00:23:00,089
- Ji Hyo's singing's gotten better. - Let's show them what we've got.

560
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:03,819
(Coming up next is a stage by an aunt and an uncle.)

561
00:23:03,889 --> 00:23:07,419
("Rose of Betrayal" by Uhm Jung Hwa)

562
00:23:09,819 --> 00:23:12,819
(It's a collaboration between an aunt and an uncle.)

563
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:15,449
(It's a culture shock.)

564
00:23:16,749 --> 00:23:19,119
(We will come in first place.)

565
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:21,849
(Haha and Ji Hyo scored 91 points.)

566
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:24,289
- They got 91. - How did they do that?

567
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:25,989
How did they get 91?

568
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:29,219
Honestly, you should deduce that by 10 points.

569
00:23:29,219 --> 00:23:31,589
- Where's your consciousness? - Seriously.

570
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:34,249
- I said there are bonus points. - Right.

571
00:23:34,249 --> 00:23:36,119
This was the criteria for the bonus points.

572
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,189
If other teams stood up out of joy while you were singing,

573
00:23:38,189 --> 00:23:40,119
you'd receive as many points as...

574
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,019
the number of people who stood up times two.

575
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,319
- Multiplied by two? - Yes.

576
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,919
We should be the winner, then.

577
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:47,389
- What did you mean by "out of joy"? - These are the results.

578
00:23:47,389 --> 00:23:50,619
Haha and Ji Hyo scored 91 points on the karaoke machine.

579
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:52,189
The number of people who stood up is...

580
00:23:52,189 --> 00:23:54,819
(How many people in the audience got up from their seats?)

581
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:55,949
There were none.

582
00:23:56,249 --> 00:23:57,349
You got 91 points in total.

583
00:23:57,719 --> 00:23:59,449
Their performance wasn't fun.

584
00:23:59,449 --> 00:24:01,949
Jae Seok and Jung Seok scored 86 points on the karaoke machine.

585
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:03,819
The number of people who stood up is...

586
00:24:03,819 --> 00:24:05,119
(Their performance was greatly appreciated by many.)

587
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,819
Everyone.

588
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:12,619
(Jung Seok's singing received a standing ovation.)

589
00:24:12,989 --> 00:24:15,149
You get 12 bonus points. 98 points in total.

590
00:24:16,349 --> 00:24:18,519
What are you so happy about? It's not like it was because of you.

591
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:20,719
Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo had three people stand up.

592
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:22,249
You got 94 points in total.

593
00:24:22,249 --> 00:24:25,119
For Seok Jin and Jong Kook, Haha was the only one up.

594
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,189
Did you stand up?

595
00:24:26,189 --> 00:24:27,349
I did?

596
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:28,849
(I have no recollection of that memory.)

597
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:30,019
It was fun listening to you sing.

598
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,519
- Wasn't it? - It was.

599
00:24:31,989 --> 00:24:34,719
I was watching them, but they kept asking if I was looking at them.

600
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:38,219
- Jae Seok and Jung Seok won. - Okay.

601
00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:41,049
- We sang really well, didn't we? - Okay.

602
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:45,549
The first card will be drawn by Jung Seok.

603
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,649
Only Jung Seok can go inside to choose a card.

604
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:49,089
- I see. - Okay.

605
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,989
- Select a good card. - Trust me.

606
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:52,119
This is great.

607
00:24:52,219 --> 00:24:56,689
(Jung Seok confidently goes into the room.)

608
00:24:58,149 --> 00:24:59,389
(He strides inside.)

609
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:00,389
Here are the cards.

610
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,319
Since you won the game,

611
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:06,319
please select one card you would like to check first.

612
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:09,089
- I choose this one. - Okay.

613
00:25:10,689 --> 00:25:13,019
(The card he chose is showing all of one's special talents.)

614
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:15,889
Now, please choose a card.

615
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:16,889
Okay.

616
00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:17,889
(He can also choose the card he checked beforehand.)

617
00:25:18,689 --> 00:25:21,319
- This one. - Please check the card you picked.

618
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,489
(What is the card Jung Seok selected as their first card?)

619
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,289
Please show the card to the camera.

620
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:29,119
(He doesn't seem happy about his choice.)

621
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:33,389
(His first card is the Penalty Card.)

622
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:39,289
(Even if he was in an advantageous position, he seems to be unlucky.)

623
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,549
- Did you choose a card? - Yes, I did.

624
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:45,119
- It's possible he picked a bad one. - Of course.

625
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:46,819
He could've picked the worst one out of all.

626
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:49,219
(This is the penalty card, isn't it?)

627
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:50,719
Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo are next.

628
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:51,719
Okay.

629
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:53,119
(Kyung Soo picks a card since he won second place.)

630
00:25:53,749 --> 00:25:55,619
(Charm Card)

631
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:56,889
What is this?

632
00:25:57,449 --> 00:25:59,149
(Forehead Kiss Card)

633
00:25:59,149 --> 00:26:00,519
(Highway Card)

634
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:05,049
(Every team selected their first card.)

635
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:08,519
(12 cards remain. What will they face?)

636
00:26:08,949 --> 00:26:11,719
The second mission is "Trust in Your Brother".

637
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:12,889
- What is that? - Now, this is sounds exciting.

638
00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:17,889
The team that wins this mission can check three cards.

639
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:21,589
The 2nd place team gets 2 cards. The 3rd place team gets 1 card.

640
00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:23,789
- You can only check them inside. - I see.

641
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:25,649
Younger brothers will solve the quizzes in the front.

642
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:27,419
Older brothers will sit under the trays and the trays...

643
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,619
will fall on their heads if their brothers give wrong answers.

644
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:31,689
- Trust in me. - I trust you.

645
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:33,849
- When you figure out the answer, - If you know it, call it.

646
00:26:33,889 --> 00:26:36,489
you need to ring a special buzzer...

647
00:26:36,489 --> 00:26:38,489
that the staff suggests.

648
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:39,919
- Okay. - I understand.

649
00:26:39,949 --> 00:26:43,119
Before we start, I'll let you know the special buzzer.

650
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,149
Ji Hyo, be proactive.

651
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:46,889
The special buzzer for this round is charms.

652
00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:48,049
(They need to show off their charms.)

653
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:49,249
We're doomed.

654
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:51,119
- No way. - You have to show your charms.

655
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,589
- Kyung Soo, show your charms. - Come to the front and show them.

656
00:26:52,589 --> 00:26:53,849
- I'm sure Kyung Soo's good at it. - How...

657
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:55,589
- How will he do that? - Jong Kook.

658
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:57,689
- Ji Hyo, show us one. - I trust in you, Jong Kook.

659
00:26:57,689 --> 00:26:59,449
Jung Seok is good at things like this.

660
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,019
- Of course, he is. - He's full of charms.

661
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,589
- He does have a lot of them. - Come on.

662
00:27:03,219 --> 00:27:05,749
- It is a picture association quiz. - A picture association quiz.

663
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:08,049
Yes, I'll show you the first one.

664
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:10,249
In 1, 2, 3.

665
00:27:10,749 --> 00:27:11,919
(What is it?)

666
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,019
- What is that? - It's a dog.

667
00:27:14,219 --> 00:27:15,519
I think I know this one.

668
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:17,649
(The first problem looks difficult.)

669
00:27:17,949 --> 00:27:20,489
(What is that dog?)

670
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:22,289
The dog is standing on a stage.

671
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:23,519
(They are speechless.)

672
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:24,889
What is it? I seriously have no clue.

673
00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:26,719
- The dog is the main part of it. - Is that Gary?

674
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:28,719
(I figured out the answer.)

675
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,819
- Show your charms. - You have to show them.

676
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:34,189
Show them. I know you can do it.

677
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:36,819
- One plus one is a cutie pie - Come on.

678
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:38,619
(She always does that.)

679
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:41,489
(She's trying her best to show them her charms.)

680
00:27:41,489 --> 00:27:42,719
Darn it.

681
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:43,889
(Darn it.)

682
00:27:44,389 --> 00:27:45,619
(This is his third culture shock.)

683
00:27:45,619 --> 00:27:48,319
- Look at Kyung Soo's face. - I'm her partner. I'm going crazy.

684
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,849
- Can Jong Kook try? - The answer is...

685
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:51,049
He can't see.

686
00:27:51,219 --> 00:27:52,219
It's Gary.

687
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:55,589
(Is the identity of this dog...)

688
00:27:55,589 --> 00:27:57,019
(Gary?)

689
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:58,319
- Did she say Gary? - How is that Gary?

690
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,319
(It's incorrect.)

691
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:01,789
(How can it possibly be Gary?)

692
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:03,049
It's a dog.

693
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:04,789
Can all the dogs be Gary?

694
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,519
Have you not forgotten him yet?

695
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,149
- No, it looks like Gary. - It's too late, Ji Hyo.

696
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:09,619
- The answer has three syllables. - What is it?

697
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:11,089
I think I figured it out for certain.

698
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:12,849
- Are you sure? - What is it?

699
00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:14,319
"I love you, woof woof"?

700
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,849
- The first syllable is correct. - Right.

701
00:28:16,849 --> 00:28:18,489
- Okay. - We know the first one.

702
00:28:19,219 --> 00:28:21,849
- A cheering dog? - Isn't it individual skill?

703
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:24,419
Go, Jung Seok.

704
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:25,889
(They both get up at the same time.)

705
00:28:25,949 --> 00:28:27,219
- Jung Seok was first. - Come on.

706
00:28:27,219 --> 00:28:28,689
(Hello, I'm here.)

707
00:28:28,689 --> 00:28:30,849
- Stop it. - Jung Seok got there first.

708
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:33,019
(We made this segment to see Jung Seok's charms.)

709
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:34,489
- Come on. - Why did you go up with him?

710
00:28:34,489 --> 00:28:35,819
Jung Seok was here first.

711
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:37,119
- What did you say? - He's angry.

712
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,589
I went through all this trouble for nothing?

713
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:40,849
- Who said you were first? - Why didn't you tell me earlier?

714
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:42,049
You should've told me earlier!

715
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:44,049
He even looked scary.

716
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:46,949
- Jung Seok. - Should I show mine?

717
00:28:46,949 --> 00:28:47,989
Yes, you need to show your charms.

718
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:49,689
Show them how it's properly done.

719
00:28:49,689 --> 00:28:51,149
I showed them a lot of charms.

720
00:28:51,589 --> 00:28:55,389
(Every woman has been waiting for this moment.)

721
00:28:55,949 --> 00:28:59,519
(Only his girlfriend saw his charms. Now, he's about to show to all.)

722
00:29:00,219 --> 00:29:01,619
- You'll do fine, Jung Seok. - Right now...

723
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:04,949
- What was that? - Gosh, I can't do it.

724
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:06,419
- Was that it? - He blew his chance.

725
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:07,849
- I can only give you one chance. - Jung Seok, just do it.

726
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:10,049
Why don't you pretend to be cute at least?

727
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:11,049
(He tries to be cute.)

728
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,519
- What is that? He can't do that. - It's acceptable.

729
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:13,749
That's good enough.

730
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:15,119
This is good enough?

731
00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:17,219
- The answer is individual skill. - Seriously?

732
00:29:17,219 --> 00:29:18,349
- Individual skill? - Hold on.

733
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:19,849
The answer is individual skill.

734
00:29:19,849 --> 00:29:25,849
(Is his answer, individual skill, correct?)

735
00:29:26,589 --> 00:29:28,019
(It's correct.)

736
00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:30,389
(Everyone gets smacked by a tray.)

737
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:32,819
- Really? - How is that possible?

738
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:34,289
(He managed to get a point unexpectedly.)

739
00:29:34,819 --> 00:29:36,219
- I see. - It is individual skill.

740
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:38,619
- Now, I understand. - Right.

741
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:40,749
It is individual skill. This makes sense now.

742
00:29:40,749 --> 00:29:41,949
Excuse me.

743
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:44,989
You need to be more objective when you are judging his charms.

744
00:29:44,989 --> 00:29:47,419
- Are you serious now? - He should go back if it's bad.

745
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,589
- Jong Kook's charms were good, too. - What you did wasn't charming!

746
00:29:49,689 --> 00:29:52,419
(It almost made everyone turn against him.)

747
00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:54,019
- I thought I was going to lose it. - I'll show you more later.

748
00:29:54,019 --> 00:29:55,989
What you did was threatening the staff.

749
00:29:56,649 --> 00:29:58,419
(He can get your money back for you.)

750
00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:01,049
The next buzzer will be charms again.

751
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,049
(It's the same buzzer.)

752
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:04,349
It's a picture association quiz again.

753
00:30:04,489 --> 00:30:06,489
In 1, 2, 3.

754
00:30:06,749 --> 00:30:07,789
(What?)

755
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:09,919
(The picture is absurd again.)

756
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,419
- Is he skating? - He is skating.

757
00:30:11,419 --> 00:30:14,049
(He's skating and it says "kick".)

758
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:15,849
- What is it? - Kick?

759
00:30:15,889 --> 00:30:17,819
Kick, kick, kick, kick.

760
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:18,819
There are ten kicks.

761
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:21,119
Look at where 'kick' is written.

762
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,919
- The place? It's placed purposely? - Yes.

763
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:24,989
Think about the written letter and the place.

764
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,189
This is too challenging.

765
00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:27,619
It is hard indeed.

766
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:29,049
Who drew this picture?

767
00:30:29,689 --> 00:30:31,849
The last syllable is kick.

768
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,789
There must be syllables before 'kick'.

769
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:35,219
The answer should end with that syllable.

770
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:36,389
(I figured it out.)

771
00:30:37,789 --> 00:30:39,149
- What are you doing? - What is it?

772
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,749
(Kwang Soo scared him.)

773
00:30:41,749 --> 00:30:43,589
- What did you do? - Why are you so startled?

774
00:30:43,589 --> 00:30:44,719
What's wrong, Kyung Soo?

775
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:46,719
What did you do to him?

776
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,419
- I didn't blow into his ear. - What was that?

777
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:49,989
- I didn't blow into his ear. - Hold on.

778
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:52,319
(He walks confidently.)

779
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,719
I figured it out.

780
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:54,789
(He's getting ready to show his charms.)

781
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:56,419
I know the answer now.

782
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:58,889
This is my charm.

783
00:30:59,789 --> 00:31:01,719
(His charms are very straightforward.)

784
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:03,889
- What is that? - How can you call it a charm?

785
00:31:03,889 --> 00:31:04,919
You can't accept that.

786
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:06,119
(He's showing all of his charms.)

787
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,519
- He knows the answer. - What is that?

788
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,289
(Am I not cute?)

789
00:31:09,589 --> 00:31:11,319
Do a little more, Kyung Soo.

790
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,519
- Show them some moves. - This is not acceptable.

791
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:14,219
(He's trying desperately.)

792
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:15,649
He's not charming. He's acting out.

793
00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:17,519
This is his best work.

794
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,919
- Okay. We accept. - How can this be acceptable?

795
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:21,319
- The answer is corner kick. - Come on.

796
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,519
This is the answer.

797
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:24,589
(It's correct.)

798
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:27,649
(They are smacked by the trays.)

799
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,319
- That hurts. - You can't allow it.

800
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:31,219
(He is feeling proud.)

801
00:31:31,219 --> 00:31:33,019
Kwang Soo told him the answer from the back.

802
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:35,989
(Kwang Soo is teaching him how to cheat as a brother.)

803
00:31:35,989 --> 00:31:38,349
The next special buzzer is dance.

804
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:42,149
The next quiz will be middle-aged men quiz.

805
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:44,019
- Is that so? - Ji Hyo's really good at it.

806
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:45,149
We are all middle-aged men after all.

807
00:31:45,149 --> 00:31:46,419
Kyung Soo will have a hard time.

808
00:31:46,589 --> 00:31:47,889
I don't feel confident about this.

809
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:50,319
What is another word for a letter of apology?

810
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:52,989
- I know this one. - I've heard of this.

811
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:54,149
Another word for a letter of apology?

812
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,549
I should know this one.

813
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:57,919
What is it? Another word for a letter of apology?

814
00:31:58,019 --> 00:31:59,789
- What was this? - Do you know this one?

815
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:01,319
I knew this before.

816
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,949
- That's cheating. - You can't tell her.

817
00:32:02,949 --> 00:32:04,389
(They are not hiding the fact that they're cheating anymore.)

818
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:06,219
- He told her. - That shouldn't happen.

819
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:08,489
(What is this song?)

820
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:10,619
(You know the dance moves for this song, right?)

821
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:11,819
(She dances as she wants to.)

822
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:13,719
- What is that? Do the dance move. - You need to do it properly.

823
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:15,519
(Don't you know Twice's dance?)

824
00:32:15,789 --> 00:32:17,119
(It's evident she hasn't seen it before.)

825
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,489
What kind of dance move is that?

826
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,719
What was that?

827
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:20,749
That was not acceptable.

828
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:21,889
(Haha gets smacked.)

829
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:24,919
You're supposed to look cute as you put your fingers below your chin.

830
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:26,389
Hey, that's not how you do it.

831
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:28,419
- You only do it with one finger. - This is how you do it.

832
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:29,519
- Only one finger. - Look at this.

833
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:30,849
(She's trying to be cute.)

834
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:31,949
Try to be cute.

835
00:32:32,849 --> 00:32:34,049
You need to do the next one, too.

836
00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:35,719
(Darn it.)

837
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:37,719
- I'm done! - Come on, Ji Hyo.

838
00:32:37,849 --> 00:32:39,989
- Why can't you do this? - Like this?

839
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:42,319
Have your fingers like this and move it like this.

840
00:32:45,149 --> 00:32:49,019
- Hey, that's not right. - Give me a break!

841
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:51,989
- Hey, Ji Hyo. This isn't hard. - I can't do it.

842
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:53,919
- What is it? - Fine. I'll show you.

843
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,119
(Let's see how well you do.)

844
00:32:56,419 --> 00:32:58,919
- That's not right. - You don't do it like that.

845
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:01,119
- What is he doing? - That's wrong.

846
00:33:01,889 --> 00:33:03,919
- How can you mess it up? - What can the answer be?

847
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:05,649
(I figured it out.)

848
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,519
- Hey, that's cheating. - What are you doing?

849
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:12,149
- Jung Seok, it's time to dance. - Okay. I got it.

850
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:14,619
Jung Seok.

851
00:33:15,219 --> 00:33:16,289
(He's good.)

852
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:18,119
Jung Seok.

853
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:22,489
What is that?

854
00:33:22,489 --> 00:33:25,019
(His moves are out-dated, but he looks good dancing.)

855
00:33:26,189 --> 00:33:27,749
(He pokes and spins.)

856
00:33:27,749 --> 00:33:30,019
That was lovely.

857
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:32,119
(He's too enthusiastic.)

858
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,419
- Here we go. - Okay.

859
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:34,789
The answer is global.

860
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:35,949
- That's right. - Why is it global?

861
00:33:35,949 --> 00:33:37,449
There we go.

862
00:33:38,889 --> 00:33:41,049
- I understand now. - That makes sense.

863
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:42,589
(A person writes the letter as the person is being punished.)

864
00:33:43,149 --> 00:33:44,919
- That was the right answer. - I see now.

865
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:46,819
Now the older brothers will be solving the quizzes.

866
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:47,989
- Okay. - Great.

867
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:50,949
- Do it well. - You did well, Jung Seok.

868
00:33:51,389 --> 00:33:53,719
Gosh, look at them. I mean,

869
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:55,919
everyone out here plays dirty.

870
00:33:56,219 --> 00:33:57,319
They're all gathered here.

871
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:59,289
(Dirty players are all gathered.)

872
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:00,919
The next buzzer is charms.

873
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:03,049
- Charms again? - The rule is the same as before.

874
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:05,219
- I'm ready for it. - It's going to be hard for me.

875
00:34:05,219 --> 00:34:06,589
You'll see a picture.

876
00:34:06,889 --> 00:34:08,289
You need to tell me the title and the line from the scene.

877
00:34:08,289 --> 00:34:09,989
- Even the line? - The title of the film?

878
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:11,419
It's going to be hard to tell the line.

879
00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:14,159
In 1, 2, 3. Here it is.

880
00:34:14,689 --> 00:34:15,889
- Got it. - What is this?

881
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:16,949
- Hold on. - Line from this scene?

882
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:19,089
Do you seriously expect us to tell you the line from this scene?

883
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,719
- Hold on, the line is... - How is it possible?

884
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,049
It's the famous line.

885
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:24,449
This scene was...

886
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,589
- This is one of the famous lines. - Jung Seok, which film is it?

887
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,749
- Isn't this "Architecture 101"? - Do you not know?

888
00:34:28,749 --> 00:34:29,819
- I think I know. - It's not fair...

889
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:31,189
to ask the line.

890
00:34:31,249 --> 00:34:33,249
- You should not ask him. - I'll answer.

891
00:34:33,249 --> 00:34:34,919
I'll answer it. Let me.

892
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,189
This is a famous line.

893
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:38,049
The buzzer is showing my charm, right?

894
00:34:38,049 --> 00:34:40,189
- "Honey, I dreamed of a ghost." - Go away.

895
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:41,349
Get out of the way.

896
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:44,249
(Kwang Soo pretends to be sulky to act cute.)

897
00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:47,919
I dreamed of a ghost.

898
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,749
(This is crazy.)

899
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:53,419
- Jae Seok, answer, please. - Okay.

900
00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:54,889
You came out first.

901
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,749
- It's the movie "Architecture 101". - Okay.

902
00:34:56,749 --> 00:34:58,119
(The movie is "Architecture 101".)

903
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,119
"What should I do?"

904
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,159
(The line is "What should I do?")

905
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:03,889
- What was it? - Was it "What should I do?"

906
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:06,659
- It was "What should I do?" - I thought "I can't understand."

907
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:08,819
He asked Jung Seok to tell him.

908
00:35:08,819 --> 00:35:09,949
- It's not fair. - Yes, it is.

909
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:10,989
It's Nap Deuk, isn't it?

910
00:35:10,989 --> 00:35:14,319
Gosh, what's wrong with your hairstyle?

911
00:35:14,689 --> 00:35:17,449
- Spare it for your blind dates. - What's this?

912
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,519
(Then he says...)

913
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:20,819
What should I do with you?

914
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:22,219
Take this.

915
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:24,689
- It's Nap Deuk. - Try it, please.

916
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:27,519
"What should I do with you?"

917
00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:28,619
"What should I do with you?"

918
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:30,249
I just remember this.

919
00:35:30,249 --> 00:35:32,589
- Me too. That was impressive. - It was very impressive.

920
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,449
"Like this."

921
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,089
- Can he show us again? - Please show us.

922
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:38,849
- Oh my. - "Like this."

923
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:40,719
Please show us, Jung Seok.

924
00:35:42,949 --> 00:35:47,689
(Nap Deuk's lecture of Kiss 101 begins.)

925
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:50,189
When you kiss...

926
00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:56,689
Your tongue and mine slither in naturally...

927
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,889
like snakes. You know what snakes are, right?

928
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:00,949
And you rub them together.

929
00:36:00,949 --> 00:36:02,319
(Rub the snakes.)

930
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:03,989
Rub them so hard.

931
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:08,019
Push forward and backward. Go sideways, too.

932
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,659
- It's fantastic. - "What should I do with you?"

933
00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:13,589
"What should I do?"

934
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:15,319
"What should I do?"

935
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:17,819
(Thank you for your easy explanation of a difficult topic.)

936
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:19,449
- He's so good. - He is.

937
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:20,919
He is great.

938
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:22,349
That was funny.

939
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:24,949
- Now, it's the last question. - Let's win.

940
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:26,689
- You'll have to dance this time. - Okay.

941
00:36:26,689 --> 00:36:30,119
What do you think of this picture? In 1, 2, 3.

942
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:31,849
(What does this picture mean?)

943
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:34,689
- There is a horse in the ear. - I know.

944
00:36:34,919 --> 00:36:36,519
Is it an ear or what?

945
00:36:37,049 --> 00:36:38,659
I'll try to answer.

946
00:36:38,659 --> 00:36:40,849
I figured it out.

947
00:36:41,189 --> 00:36:42,519
The song you'll dance to is...

948
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:45,089
(He can answer if he just dances well.)

949
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:47,119
(What is this?)

950
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,119
(Is it a dance or an exorcism?)

951
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,749
- That's not the right dance. - Get in.

952
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,589
- Why? - Get in.

953
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:54,189
- This is similar. - Aren't you sorry to Kyung Soo?

954
00:36:54,189 --> 00:36:55,619
- I was doing it right. - Hey.

955
00:36:55,949 --> 00:36:57,659
Kyung Soo.

956
00:36:57,659 --> 00:36:59,419
- Please come here. - Please show us.

957
00:36:59,419 --> 00:37:00,889
Let's see the dance of an EXO member.

958
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:02,119
Try to dance with Kyung Soo.

959
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,519
- Let's see all five dance. - You'll be surprised.

960
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:04,819
There will be no big difference.

961
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:07,589
Show us the original dance, Kyung Soo.

962
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:10,159
(Go, D.O. of EXO.)

963
00:37:10,989 --> 00:37:13,419
(This is the original dance.)

964
00:37:13,419 --> 00:37:14,949
(He is a mess.)

965
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:17,119
- Like this? - It is totally different.

966
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,519
- There is a big difference. - There is.

967
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:21,889
(Isn't this how you do it?)

968
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:22,949
What are you doing?

969
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:25,349
- What's he doing? - Didn't you see Kyung Soo?

970
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:26,519
This is it.

971
00:37:27,489 --> 00:37:28,819
(Kwang Soo wants to hit him.)

972
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,689
- We will dance together. - To "Growl".

973
00:37:32,789 --> 00:37:34,719
- Kyung Soo, watch us dance. - Yes.

974
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,019
Choose the best dancer.

975
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:37,489
(It's a dance competition.)

976
00:37:39,989 --> 00:37:41,419
Kyung Soo should teach them how to dance.

977
00:37:42,419 --> 00:37:45,159
You're in the way. Get out of the way.

978
00:37:45,449 --> 00:37:46,659
Get out.

979
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:48,849
(Do you hear the EXO fans growling in anger?)

980
00:37:49,749 --> 00:37:51,219
- Get out of the way. - Okay.

981
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:52,719
- What is this? - Haha gets the chance.

982
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:57,319
(What's Haha's answer to the picture?)

983
00:37:57,319 --> 00:37:58,319
A horse riding game.

984
00:37:58,319 --> 00:37:59,949
- What are you talking about? - What?

985
00:37:59,949 --> 00:38:01,419
(It's the wrong answer.)

986
00:38:01,419 --> 00:38:03,049
- Me. - Me.

987
00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:04,919
- Me! - I'll answer.

988
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:06,589
Let me have a chance.

989
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:11,389
(The dance battle of "Growl" is getting fiercer.)

990
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,249
- Jae Seok, it's your turn. - Okay.

991
00:38:14,249 --> 00:38:15,349
- A whisper. - Yes.

992
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:20,159
(Could "whisper" be the correct answer?)

993
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,219
- A whisper. - Yes.

994
00:38:21,219 --> 00:38:22,719
(Could "whisper" be the correct answer?)

995
00:38:23,049 --> 00:38:24,419
I thought they were earplugs.

996
00:38:24,689 --> 00:38:26,219
I thought it was words.

997
00:38:26,319 --> 00:38:27,389
Everyone had a different answer.

998
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:30,019
Words, earplugs, a horse riding game,

999
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:31,049
- and a whisper. - I was wrong anyway.

1000
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,219
- It was a whisper. - Did you think it was earplugs?

1001
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:35,989
- We all had different answers. - I thought of a horse riding game.

1002
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:37,489
- You did. - My answer was "words".

1003
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:38,849
Mine was earplugs.

1004
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:40,089
(They all had different yet wrong answers.)

1005
00:38:40,089 --> 00:38:42,419
- But it was a whisper. - Since the horse plugged the ear?

1006
00:38:42,419 --> 00:38:43,589
Yes, I thought so.

1007
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:46,849
I thought the ear was hanging off the horse.

1008
00:38:46,849 --> 00:38:49,989
I went overboard and was mistaken.

1009
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:51,789
(His idea was also creative.)

1010
00:38:51,949 --> 00:38:53,619
According to the final score,

1011
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:57,419
the first place is Jae Seok and Jung Seok.

1012
00:38:57,949 --> 00:39:00,489
The second place is Jong Kook and Seok Jin.

1013
00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:02,419
The third place is Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo.

1014
00:39:02,419 --> 00:39:04,659
- I can't believe it. - It's okay, Haha.

1015
00:39:05,889 --> 00:39:06,989
(They currently have a Penalty Card.)

1016
00:39:06,989 --> 00:39:08,789
We need to pick the same pair, right?

1017
00:39:08,789 --> 00:39:10,189
Right. Choose.

1018
00:39:10,249 --> 00:39:13,689
Please choose three cards you want to check.

1019
00:39:13,689 --> 00:39:15,949
- Then will we be able to check? - Yes.

1020
00:39:16,449 --> 00:39:17,819
(If you choose the same pair, you can throw them away.)

1021
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:20,519
You can choose three cards total.

1022
00:39:20,789 --> 00:39:21,789
I'll pick this one.

1023
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:24,389
(The paired cards don't include the Penalty Cards.)

1024
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:27,289
I'll choose the one at the end.

1025
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:28,289
(Kiss on the Cheek Card)

1026
00:39:28,289 --> 00:39:32,419
(Tour around Daegu Card)

1027
00:39:32,419 --> 00:39:33,689
(Another Kiss on the Cheek Card)

1028
00:39:33,689 --> 00:39:36,219
(They are the same cards.)

1029
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:38,619
The final mission is like that of Find the Robber game.

1030
00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:41,919
All you have to do is throw away all the cards that you have.

1031
00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:43,749
- We can throw them away. - Okay.

1032
00:39:44,389 --> 00:39:45,589
(The team without any cards will be the winner.)

1033
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:47,789
(They have two Kiss on the Cheek Cards.)

1034
00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:50,289
(They have a chance to choose another three cards.)

1035
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:51,749
Shall I pick another?

1036
00:39:51,919 --> 00:39:53,659
Please show the card to me.

1037
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:55,849
- We should keep it secret. - I know.

1038
00:39:55,849 --> 00:39:57,519
- Let's choose one. - Okay.

1039
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:00,489
(They check two cards and choose three.)

1040
00:40:00,489 --> 00:40:02,819
- Try to pick. - If you checked the two cards...

1041
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:04,159
This is unbelievable.

1042
00:40:04,989 --> 00:40:06,049
- The cards... - We can avoid the Penalty Cards.

1043
00:40:06,049 --> 00:40:08,089
- I see. - This is great.

1044
00:40:08,189 --> 00:40:11,589
(They picked three and can throw away two of them.)

1045
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,659
Choose the three cards you want to take.

1046
00:40:14,659 --> 00:40:17,819
(They checked just one card and try to choose three.)

1047
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:20,789
(It's the Penalty Card.)

1048
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:23,049
(Oh my gosh.)

1049
00:40:23,049 --> 00:40:24,389
You're so unlucky.

1050
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:27,789
You should avoid this card.

1051
00:40:27,789 --> 00:40:29,119
(They have a Charm Card and a Penalty Card.)

1052
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,519
Like this?

1053
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:32,119
(Kiss on the Cheek Card)

1054
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:34,219
(Tour around Daegu Card)

1055
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:35,819
(They don't even have the same cards.)

1056
00:40:37,419 --> 00:40:41,189
(Haha and Ji Hyo automatically get the rest of the cards.)

1057
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:45,319
(This is the status of the cards each team has.)

1058
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:48,189
This is round three and it's the last one before the final race.

1059
00:40:48,189 --> 00:40:49,719
It's "Night Market Bingo".

1060
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:51,119
- "Night Market"? - Great.

1061
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:53,919
- There are a lot of delicious food. - I was so hungry.

1062
00:40:54,049 --> 00:40:57,519
The winner of this mission will get an Exchange Card.

1063
00:40:57,549 --> 00:41:00,019
You don't just check them but exchange them.

1064
00:41:00,019 --> 00:41:01,119
An Exchange Card?

1065
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:04,549
You can exchange your whole stack...

1066
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:06,589
with the team you want anytime.

1067
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,889
- What? - The whole cards?

1068
00:41:07,889 --> 00:41:10,319
Anytime? Even right before the end?

1069
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,719
Then this is an important round.

1070
00:41:12,949 --> 00:41:13,989
To survive...

1071
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:17,449
- "To survive"? - What should you do to survive?

1072
00:41:17,449 --> 00:41:20,049
- "To survive"? - Is this the only way to survive?

1073
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,849
- What do you mean by that? - Were you dying?

1074
00:41:24,089 --> 00:41:25,159
Well...

1075
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:27,419
- You have a Penalty Card, right? - Kwang Soo told me...

1076
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:29,159
to pretend not to have them.

1077
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:30,389
(Kwang Soo is flustered.)

1078
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:32,219
We don't know the result yet.

1079
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:34,119
- Nobody knows. - They have them.

1080
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:36,519
- I think now we all know. - No.

1081
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:40,119
Using the hints of the pictures on the bingo board,

1082
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:42,449
visit the relevant store and complete the mission.

1083
00:41:42,449 --> 00:41:46,719
The fist team to complete a row is the winner.

1084
00:41:46,749 --> 00:41:50,689
Every time you clear the mission, we'll put the sticker of your team.

1085
00:41:50,749 --> 00:41:54,719
You can't challenge the store with a sticker anymore.

1086
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:56,919
- Other teams can't challenge it. - Really?

1087
00:41:56,919 --> 00:41:59,659
And from now, while you're racing in this round,

1088
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:03,119
the staff will scatter around, visit stores and eat food there.

1089
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,449
- The final penalty is... - Paying the bill.

1090
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:07,349
- That's right. - Oh my gosh.

1091
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:09,419
Before that, as a practice,

1092
00:42:09,419 --> 00:42:12,659
we'll let you play a few games with a bingo board here.

1093
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:13,919
As a practice.

1094
00:42:13,919 --> 00:42:15,249
- Here. - I'll have an advantage.

1095
00:42:15,249 --> 00:42:17,449
Please choose a game that you're very good at.

1096
00:42:17,819 --> 00:42:19,849
- Something you'll definitely win. - I'm good at jegichagi.

1097
00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:23,159
(Jung Seok is a very talented brother.)

1098
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:25,449
What should I do with Jung Seok?

1099
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:26,789
He is awesome.

1100
00:42:27,289 --> 00:42:29,319
It's done. We decided.

1101
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:31,549
- What is it? - We'll do jegichagi.

1102
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,289
- Jegichagi? - Is he good at it?

1103
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:34,549
- Yes. - Don't you need that?

1104
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:37,159
What about enduring the pain after hammered?

1105
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:39,159
What do you think?

1106
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:40,189
(Do you want to endure it first?)

1107
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,789
(They're practicing hard.)

1108
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:45,319
I think it'll be okay. But it's too fast.

1109
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:47,249
All right. Let's do this.

1110
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:49,249
- Can I practice it? - Yes, you can.

1111
00:42:51,389 --> 00:42:53,119
There you go.

1112
00:42:53,449 --> 00:42:56,449
It's okay. Don't exhaust yourself. Get some rest.

1113
00:42:57,249 --> 00:42:59,619
(You can be an ace with only five in Running Man.)

1114
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,519
We're doing jegichagi.

1115
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:03,389
- Is he good at jegichagi? - Yes.

1116
00:43:03,389 --> 00:43:05,089
- He is good. - Is he?

1117
00:43:05,089 --> 00:43:06,249
This is samgyeopsal.

1118
00:43:06,249 --> 00:43:08,519
- This is rolled samgyeopsal. - It is.

1119
00:43:08,749 --> 00:43:10,089
In this game...

1120
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:11,589
Isn't it sundae?

1121
00:43:12,219 --> 00:43:13,889
(Everyone can't help but stand in awe.)

1122
00:43:13,889 --> 00:43:16,249
- This is rolled samgyeopsal. - It is.

1123
00:43:16,249 --> 00:43:19,289
It'll be a random choice.

1124
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:22,949
(Who are the hosts of the first game?)

1125
00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:25,249
Kwang Soo's team, go first.

1126
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:27,019
- Yes! - It's them.

1127
00:43:27,019 --> 00:43:30,049
- It is face to face jump rope. - That's what you wrote.

1128
00:43:30,049 --> 00:43:33,049
That's what you wrote. In fact, if you put a snack in your mouth,

1129
00:43:33,049 --> 00:43:35,419
- it'll be more fun. - He's right.

1130
00:43:35,419 --> 00:43:37,119
- With a snack in our mouths... - Kwang Soo...

1131
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:40,089
Because I'm short, I think it's not a good idea.

1132
00:43:40,089 --> 00:43:41,319
Then do as you wish.

1133
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:43,719
We'll just do jump rope face to face.

1134
00:43:45,819 --> 00:43:46,949
- That is funny. - Okay.

1135
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:48,419
- He's a new type. - Do something you can do well.

1136
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:49,889
Which team do you want to fight with?

1137
00:43:50,689 --> 00:43:52,619
Jong Kook's team.

1138
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,019
- We're very good. - Us?

1139
00:43:55,019 --> 00:43:57,489
- You're clueless. - You don't know anything.

1140
00:43:57,489 --> 00:43:59,319
Start right away.

1141
00:43:59,889 --> 00:44:02,219
Are you ready? Ready.

1142
00:44:02,689 --> 00:44:05,019
- You can do this. - Ready...

1143
00:44:05,149 --> 00:44:06,419
Does anyone want to cheer for them?

1144
00:44:06,419 --> 00:44:07,589
- No. - Okay.

1145
00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:09,719
No one wants to cheer for them?

1146
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:10,819
- Right. - Why should we?

1147
00:44:10,819 --> 00:44:11,889
Ready,

1148
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:16,589
set, go.

1149
00:44:18,049 --> 00:44:19,789
(Please get stuck.)

1150
00:44:21,219 --> 00:44:22,289
Go.

1151
00:44:22,889 --> 00:44:23,989
(Gosh)

1152
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,519
(They failed to jump even once.)

1153
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:27,919
This is great.

1154
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:30,389
- It's done. - No. This is not right.

1155
00:44:30,389 --> 00:44:32,449
- We didn't even practice. - Okay. You got zero.

1156
00:44:32,449 --> 00:44:34,049
- I wanted some practice before. - It couldn't be helped.

1157
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:35,889
- We should have practiced. - Stop being stubborn.

1158
00:44:35,889 --> 00:44:38,119
(Jong Kook can't accept his poor result.)

1159
00:44:38,189 --> 00:44:40,149
- If they score zero as well... - It can happen.

1160
00:44:40,149 --> 00:44:41,619
They may get zero, too. This game is quite difficult.

1161
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:44,889
All right. Will anyone cheer for them?

1162
00:44:44,889 --> 00:44:46,019
- No. - I won't.

1163
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:47,349
- He'll hit Kwang Soo with his head. - Get ready.

1164
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:49,449
- Jump once to win. - That jump rope is really short.

1165
00:44:49,449 --> 00:44:50,749
Just jump once.

1166
00:44:51,219 --> 00:44:52,489
- All right. Ready, - They will fail.

1167
00:44:52,919 --> 00:44:54,049
set, go.

1168
00:44:54,049 --> 00:44:56,419
(They only need to jump once to win. Will they succeed?)

1169
00:44:57,249 --> 00:44:59,389
(Please fall down. I know you will, Kwang Soo.)

1170
00:44:59,389 --> 00:45:00,549
Set, go.

1171
00:45:03,019 --> 00:45:05,119
(That was a complete mess.)

1172
00:45:07,249 --> 00:45:08,489
What's wrong? You were better last time.

1173
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,119
- All right. Then... - Please. Give us another chance.

1174
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:11,449
- Another chance? - That's what we asked for, too.

1175
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:13,289
No way. You can't practice before a round.

1176
00:45:13,289 --> 00:45:14,649
- Will you swing the jump rope? - Who was it?

1177
00:45:14,649 --> 00:45:16,789
- Was it me? - Yes. You got tripped over.

1178
00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:19,449
It's really hard to jump even once because this jump rope is so short.

1179
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:21,389
Kyung Soo is really annoyed right now.

1180
00:45:21,389 --> 00:45:22,789
- No, he's not. - Let's skip once at least.

1181
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,289
- Was it me? Really? - Get ready.

1182
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:25,419
- That jump rope is too short. - Jump like this.

1183
00:45:25,419 --> 00:45:28,349
(It's their second time trying. They must be better than the last time.)

1184
00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:29,719
Ready, set, go.

1185
00:45:31,549 --> 00:45:32,619
We skipped once.

1186
00:45:33,919 --> 00:45:35,049
We skipped once.

1187
00:45:35,049 --> 00:45:36,749
We did it. We did one.

1188
00:45:36,819 --> 00:45:38,789
- You sound so happy. - Just do as you did before.

1189
00:45:39,249 --> 00:45:40,989
Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo may lose.

1190
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:42,719
You must skip twice to win.

1191
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,249
I feel nervous only because I need to skip ropes just twice.

1192
00:45:45,249 --> 00:45:47,549
- They only need to skip twice. - Be careful when you jump.

1193
00:45:47,549 --> 00:45:50,719
Kyung Soo looks really desperate.

1194
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,089
- Jump as high as you can. - Ready, set...

1195
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:56,149
(Will Jong Kook's team win or will it be a draw?)

1196
00:45:56,149 --> 00:45:57,289
Set, go.

1197
00:45:58,019 --> 00:45:59,519
One. Are you okay?

1198
00:46:00,749 --> 00:46:01,819
(Kwang Soo bumps into Kyung Soo.)

1199
00:46:04,919 --> 00:46:06,249
What? Did they skip once?

1200
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:07,949
Their knees bumped into each other.

1201
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:10,449
This match is strangely intense.

1202
00:46:10,649 --> 00:46:11,649
It's a draw now.

1203
00:46:11,649 --> 00:46:12,889
(They sacrificed their knees to get a draw.)

1204
00:46:12,889 --> 00:46:14,589
- Are you all right? - I told you...

1205
00:46:15,549 --> 00:46:17,449
that our knees may bump into each other.

1206
00:46:18,149 --> 00:46:20,049
(It's a really intense match. The third round begins.)

1207
00:46:20,049 --> 00:46:21,519
Set, go.

1208
00:46:21,819 --> 00:46:22,819
Set, go.

1209
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:24,549
- Gosh. - What was that?

1210
00:46:25,789 --> 00:46:27,049
(Gosh)

1211
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:28,949
(Jong Kook's inside is boiling with anger.)

1212
00:46:28,949 --> 00:46:30,549
Now is your chance. Chance to win.

1213
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:32,289
This is the biggest chance you will ever have.

1214
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,649
It seriously is. Grab it.

1215
00:46:33,649 --> 00:46:36,689
- We must get this. We must. - Just do as you did before.

1216
00:46:36,689 --> 00:46:38,519
- Ready... - Jong Kook. This isn't easy at all.

1217
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:40,719
- I minded my knees. - Ready, set...

1218
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:43,089
- Seok Jin, please step back. - We don't know the result yet.

1219
00:46:43,089 --> 00:46:44,749
- Let's have another match. - Ready,

1220
00:46:44,749 --> 00:46:46,889
- Come on, Kwang Soo. - set, go.

1221
00:46:46,889 --> 00:46:50,849
(Win and fill the bingo card!)

1222
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:53,819
- Come on, Kwang Soo. - Set, go.

1223
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:55,019
- They did... - Yes.

1224
00:46:55,019 --> 00:46:58,319
(They did it!)

1225
00:46:58,589 --> 00:47:01,689
(I love you, brother. You are my prince forever.)

1226
00:47:01,689 --> 00:47:05,389
(Me, too. Stay with me forever.)

1227
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:07,419
- We won. - Yes.

1228
00:47:07,919 --> 00:47:09,919
I never thought this game would be so interesting.

1229
00:47:10,019 --> 00:47:11,419
It was really intense.

1230
00:47:11,419 --> 00:47:12,719
(They mark one square and enjoy the food.)

1231
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:14,049
Look at that meat.

1232
00:47:14,049 --> 00:47:16,119
- That's rolled samgyeopsal. - That is rolled.

1233
00:47:16,449 --> 00:47:17,749
- They're in a better position now. - Amazing.

1234
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:20,519
- We can't eat that anyway. - How would it taste like?

1235
00:47:21,189 --> 00:47:22,289
This is really delicious.

1236
00:47:22,289 --> 00:47:24,449
It tastes different than you might expect.

1237
00:47:25,249 --> 00:47:27,049
There isn't any rice in the filling.

1238
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:31,519
- There are vegetables and squid. - Vegetables sounds nice.

1239
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:32,919
- Here comes the next menu. - Goodness.

1240
00:47:32,919 --> 00:47:34,819
(Here comes the next menu from Daegu's night market.)

1241
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:36,449
It looks really delicious.

1242
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:39,289
- I'd like to eat that. - We were really close.

1243
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:41,349
All right then. Wait. Jung Seok, whom should we pick?

1244
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:44,449
- Whom should we pick? - Well...

1245
00:47:44,889 --> 00:47:46,789
- How about them? - Sounds good.

1246
00:47:47,289 --> 00:47:48,949
(Yes? Are you talking about us?)

1247
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,489
- I want to take my revenge, too. - All right.

1248
00:47:51,489 --> 00:47:53,789
- Are you still resentful? - Yes, I am.

1249
00:47:53,889 --> 00:47:55,089
I was avoiding your eyes.

1250
00:47:55,149 --> 00:47:57,719
- I was looking at the floor. - You're still resentful about that.

1251
00:47:57,719 --> 00:47:59,219
- I didn't know that. - I don't think we can win.

1252
00:47:59,219 --> 00:48:01,219
We'll play jegichagi without any practice beforehand.

1253
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:02,889
You practiced really hard over there, didn't you?

1254
00:48:02,889 --> 00:48:05,319
- The rule wasn't decided then. - I see.

1255
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:07,319
- You can catch jegi only once. - All right.

1256
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:09,189
- Only one of you... - So we can catch once each, right?

1257
00:48:09,189 --> 00:48:11,619
- No. You can catch it only once. - Only once? I see.

1258
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:13,689
- We'll choose your jegi, too. - That silver-colored one...

1259
00:48:14,049 --> 00:48:15,719
- Here. - No. Give us that gold-colored one.

1260
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:18,249
- That jegi is suffering hair loss. - What is that?

1261
00:48:18,949 --> 00:48:21,089
- What are you doing? - We'll give this for you.

1262
00:48:21,089 --> 00:48:23,219
- Hey. That's too much. - Three are too many strips here.

1263
00:48:23,219 --> 00:48:25,419
- How can you rip them off? - What's the matter?

1264
00:48:25,749 --> 00:48:28,219
- How can you do that? - We're the ones who set the rule.

1265
00:48:28,219 --> 00:48:29,389
- Come on, stop it. - Honestly, we're...

1266
00:48:29,389 --> 00:48:30,719
- Stop ripping off strips. - All right. I'll stop.

1267
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:32,919
- Here you go. - What is this?

1268
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:34,949
This is as bald as my head.

1269
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:36,249
Remember. No practice.

1270
00:48:36,249 --> 00:48:38,019
Look at that. It's so thin.

1271
00:48:38,019 --> 00:48:40,649
- Be careful. You may blow it away. - This jegi is really thin.

1272
00:48:41,149 --> 00:48:43,549
- There isn't any strip left. - Okay. Just begin.

1273
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:45,649
- I'm ready. - Ready, set, go.

1274
00:48:47,689 --> 00:48:49,349
- Two. Three. - Three. What?

1275
00:48:50,389 --> 00:48:51,619
(Startled)

1276
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:53,749
- Three. Four. - Three. Four.

1277
00:48:54,219 --> 00:48:55,649
- Five? No. - He scored four.

1278
00:48:55,649 --> 00:48:57,419
- He scored four. Amazing. - Four? That's pathetic.

1279
00:48:57,419 --> 00:48:59,419
It's so thin, so it falls down quickly.

1280
00:48:59,419 --> 00:49:00,749
Look at his face.

1281
00:49:01,349 --> 00:49:03,049
- It falls down really quickly. - Wait a minute.

1282
00:49:03,489 --> 00:49:04,889
- Just give it to me for a second. - Why?

1283
00:49:05,449 --> 00:49:06,549
Stop it.

1284
00:49:06,549 --> 00:49:09,319
(Stop ripping them off!)

1285
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:10,719
(The jegi now looks pitiful.)

1286
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:12,389
- How can I play with this? - You can't play with this.

1287
00:49:12,389 --> 00:49:13,719
(His jegi is ripped in pieces.)

1288
00:49:14,949 --> 00:49:16,319
All right. I'll give you another one.

1289
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,189
Do you want me to pull out your hair just like that?

1290
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:21,689
- This is thin as well. - Here. This is better.

1291
00:49:21,689 --> 00:49:23,089
This is really thin.

1292
00:49:23,089 --> 00:49:25,049
- What is that? - That jegi looks pitiful.

1293
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:26,289
- Shall I begin? - Yes.

1294
00:49:26,289 --> 00:49:28,389
- This jegi is terrible. - Did Seok Jin score four?

1295
00:49:28,389 --> 00:49:29,649
- I'll start. - Okay.

1296
00:49:29,919 --> 00:49:32,649
- Five. Six. Seven. Eight. - Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

1297
00:49:32,649 --> 00:49:34,449
- Nine. Ten. - You can catch it if you need to.

1298
00:49:34,789 --> 00:49:36,089
- 11, 12. - Go on. You're good.

1299
00:49:36,819 --> 00:49:38,619
(Staring)

1300
00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:39,889
(What are you doing?)

1301
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:42,189
15, 16.

1302
00:49:42,289 --> 00:49:43,289
What are you doing?

1303
00:49:44,149 --> 00:49:45,149
(Tap)

1304
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:48,219
- I was just standing here. - He did that on purpose.

1305
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,789
- I was just standing here. - That's a foul.

1306
00:49:50,789 --> 00:49:52,949
- That was mean. - Jae Seok is so mean.

1307
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:54,519
You must step aside.

1308
00:49:54,519 --> 00:49:56,649
- You didn't tell me to. - I swear.

1309
00:49:56,649 --> 00:49:58,519
If you don't move aside this time, I'll just kick you.

1310
00:49:59,349 --> 00:50:00,989
- I mean it. - All right. I get it.

1311
00:50:00,989 --> 00:50:02,549
- Jong Kook was good. - I must play well.

1312
00:50:02,549 --> 00:50:03,919
Jung Seok. Should we play with this jegi?

1313
00:50:03,919 --> 00:50:05,119
- Yes. Play with that jegi. - Okay.

1314
00:50:05,289 --> 00:50:08,689
(This is Jae Seok and Jung Seok's turn to play.)

1315
00:50:08,689 --> 00:50:10,949
- One. Two. Three. Four... - You're really stable.

1316
00:50:10,949 --> 00:50:12,949
(Jae Seok's play seems quite solid.)

1317
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:17,049
(Only 7? Would that be it?)

1318
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:18,789
- Catch it. - Good.

1319
00:50:18,789 --> 00:50:22,149
(That was a good catch.)

1320
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:24,649
- That was good, Jae Seok. - Did you see it?

1321
00:50:24,789 --> 00:50:26,349
- I caught it with style. - That surprised me.

1322
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:28,419
Now, you're starting over from zero.

1323
00:50:28,549 --> 00:50:30,219
- Do we have any more chances? - No, we don't.

1324
00:50:31,449 --> 00:50:33,489
(They can't catch their jegi now. Jae Seok gives his second try.)

1325
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:35,219
- Three. Four. Five. Six... - We're here. Don't get near us.

1326
00:50:35,219 --> 00:50:36,689
(Jae Seok plays really comfortably.)

1327
00:50:36,689 --> 00:50:37,689
- He's good. - Eight. Nine.

1328
00:50:37,689 --> 00:50:39,449
(Seok Jin is not happy.)

1329
00:50:39,449 --> 00:50:40,619
(He steps forward.)

1330
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:43,449
- Was it 13? - Yes. You scored 13.

1331
00:50:43,449 --> 00:50:44,689
Wasn't it 23? I'm confused.

1332
00:50:44,749 --> 00:50:47,489
(Here comes the master of jegi.)

1333
00:50:48,789 --> 00:50:50,089
(Jung Seok only needs to score 10 to win this match.)

1334
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:51,189
- You only need to score 10. - Go for 10.

1335
00:50:51,189 --> 00:50:53,289
- Is Jung Seok good? - Yes. He is really good.

1336
00:50:53,689 --> 00:50:55,549
- All right. - He didn't have any practice.

1337
00:50:56,449 --> 00:50:57,789
- You only need to score 10. - Go for 10.

1338
00:50:57,789 --> 00:50:59,789
- Is Jung Seok good? - Yes. He is really good.

1339
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:01,949
(I believe in you, my brother.)

1340
00:51:03,449 --> 00:51:04,749
- One. Two. Three. - Good. There you go.

1341
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:06,419
He looks solid.

1342
00:51:06,419 --> 00:51:07,719
(He's outstanding.)

1343
00:51:07,749 --> 00:51:09,149
Seven, eight.

1344
00:51:11,649 --> 00:51:15,519
(Victory is in his hands.)

1345
00:51:16,849 --> 00:51:17,889
- Just keep going. - 10.

1346
00:51:17,889 --> 00:51:19,519
(He goes past 10.)

1347
00:51:20,449 --> 00:51:23,049
(He begins to show off as he is sure of his victory.)

1348
00:51:23,049 --> 00:51:25,119
- Amazing. Keep it going. - 16.

1349
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:26,249
(He catches it.)

1350
00:51:26,989 --> 00:51:28,189
Amazing. Keep it going.

1351
00:51:28,189 --> 00:51:29,719
(He acts all proud.)

1352
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:30,849
What would happen if we catch it?

1353
00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:32,949
(He caught it in his hand.)

1354
00:51:32,949 --> 00:51:37,349
(According to the rule, they can only catch it once.)

1355
00:51:37,689 --> 00:51:39,589
- He caught it. - You caught it.

1356
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:41,589
- You caught it. Start over. - That's right. You caught it.

1357
00:51:41,589 --> 00:51:43,119
He caught it in the end.

1358
00:51:43,219 --> 00:51:45,589
- That's a foul. - You caught it again.

1359
00:51:45,589 --> 00:51:48,789
We already used our chance. What should we do?

1360
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:52,289
(What would be the referee's call?)

1361
00:51:52,289 --> 00:51:55,419
(Jae Seok's team loses.)

1362
00:51:55,589 --> 00:51:56,949
(Did we lose? Really?)

1363
00:51:56,949 --> 00:51:59,749
(Justice always prevails.)

1364
00:51:59,919 --> 00:52:01,889
- We won. - I'm sorry.

1365
00:52:02,149 --> 00:52:03,889
- Why did you show off like that? - I'm terribly sorry.

1366
00:52:03,889 --> 00:52:04,889
Why did you pretend as if you didn't do it?

1367
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:06,349
He tried to do it again.

1368
00:52:06,349 --> 00:52:07,589
- That was close. - Why did you do that?

1369
00:52:07,589 --> 00:52:10,449
I was certain that we won and got too excited.

1370
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:14,349
(They lose the game because he showed off after his victory.)

1371
00:52:15,449 --> 00:52:18,389
(Seok Jin's team can mark one square and enjoy their bindaetteok.)

1372
00:52:18,389 --> 00:52:20,549
- Jung Seok did really well but... - Why did you do that?

1373
00:52:20,549 --> 00:52:22,249
I thought he was telling me to eat...

1374
00:52:22,419 --> 00:52:23,689
but he's just eating everything.

1375
00:52:23,689 --> 00:52:26,289
(It's delicious enough to forget about petty teammates.)

1376
00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:27,619
We must win for food.

1377
00:52:27,619 --> 00:52:30,049
- That looks amazing. - Let me correct you.

1378
00:52:30,789 --> 00:52:33,519
(That was supposed to be ours.)

1379
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:35,849
If we take this square, then they can't win easily.

1380
00:52:35,849 --> 00:52:36,889
We should mark this square.

1381
00:52:36,889 --> 00:52:39,219
- You're right. - What would you like to do?

1382
00:52:39,219 --> 00:52:40,219
(Jae Seok successfully steals a sheet of bindaetteok.)

1383
00:52:42,749 --> 00:52:45,189
- We must keep the possibility open. - We'll mark this square.

1384
00:52:45,889 --> 00:52:48,849
(Hurry up, Jung Seok. Turn around and eat.)

1385
00:52:48,849 --> 00:52:51,019
- What are you doing? - What do you think you are doing?

1386
00:52:51,019 --> 00:52:52,789
(Jae Seok is caught at the scene of the crime.)

1387
00:52:52,789 --> 00:52:54,289
- What are you doing? - What's the matter?

1388
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:56,749
- What's the problem? - When did you take it?

1389
00:52:56,949 --> 00:52:58,149
Won't you spare us some?

1390
00:52:58,149 --> 00:52:59,319
Why did you take the sauce?

1391
00:52:59,319 --> 00:53:01,989
- To eat with bindaetteok. - It was right in front of him.

1392
00:53:03,149 --> 00:53:04,389
You wanted the sauce...

1393
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:06,819
They caught you because you took the sauce which was right here.

1394
00:53:06,819 --> 00:53:08,489
I thought they wouldn't be able to notice me.

1395
00:53:08,889 --> 00:53:10,149
- All right. - Jung Seok...

1396
00:53:10,149 --> 00:53:11,789
- is driving me mad. - Let's eat.

1397
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:15,749
(After that, they have a fierce wrap battle to win drinks...)

1398
00:53:15,749 --> 00:53:18,819
(and Kyung Soo finishes first and wins both marks and prizes.)

1399
00:53:18,919 --> 00:53:22,889
(Haha's team and Jae Seok's team haven't got any marks yet.)

1400
00:53:23,619 --> 00:53:24,889
This place is...

1401
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:27,289
just amazing.

1402
00:53:27,289 --> 00:53:29,919
- There are so many snack carts. - It's awesome.

1403
00:53:29,919 --> 00:53:34,319
This street is 350m long with about 70 snack carts.

1404
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,289
Really? Is it that long?

1405
00:53:36,289 --> 00:53:40,649
(This night market is surely big, but moreover,)

1406
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:45,649
(there are tons of delicious food.)

1407
00:53:45,649 --> 00:53:47,219
- Are there carts on this side, too? - Yes.

1408
00:53:47,219 --> 00:53:48,589
- There are carts all the way. - There are so many of them.

1409
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:52,289
- That looks so delicious. - There are about 70 snack carts.

1410
00:53:52,289 --> 00:53:56,619
Find appropriate carts, carry out missions, and mark your bingo cards.

1411
00:53:56,619 --> 00:53:57,789
- Let's go there first. - Okay.

1412
00:53:58,919 --> 00:54:01,389
(We must stop Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo first.)

1413
00:54:01,389 --> 00:54:03,549
- Find sushi cart first. Okay? - All right.

1414
00:54:03,549 --> 00:54:04,989
(The second half of "Night Market Bingo" begins.)

1415
00:54:04,989 --> 00:54:06,349
Run and scan the carts.

1416
00:54:07,149 --> 00:54:10,219
(They need to be quick at finding carts with missions.)

1417
00:54:10,219 --> 00:54:11,619
Where's the cart with tornado potatoes?

1418
00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:14,219
Excuse me. Where can I find tornado potatoes?

1419
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:15,849
(Kwang Soo's team can almost secure victory.)

1420
00:54:16,919 --> 00:54:18,449
- Where's the cart? - Where can I find tornado potatoes?

1421
00:54:18,449 --> 00:54:19,919
(I won't let you win that easily, Kwang Soo!)

1422
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:23,219
(Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo are on their way to find tornado potatoes.)

1423
00:54:23,689 --> 00:54:24,949
Here's a sushi cart.

1424
00:54:25,219 --> 00:54:26,749
- This must be the place. - Hello.

1425
00:54:26,849 --> 00:54:28,149
- Is this the right place? - Yes.

1426
00:54:28,149 --> 00:54:29,519
(They find fire sushi.)

1427
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:30,719
We just need to find tornado potatoes.

1428
00:54:32,049 --> 00:54:33,719
It looks so good.

1429
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:36,689
(A slice of beef is cooked directly with fire.)

1430
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:38,189
It's the flank?

1431
00:54:38,189 --> 00:54:40,019
(The cooked beef gets placed on the rice.)

1432
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,789
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1433
00:54:42,789 --> 00:54:47,789
(For this mission, they both have to light a match with one try.)

1434
00:54:50,589 --> 00:54:53,449
(We'll do the mission after we eat.)

1435
00:54:53,449 --> 00:54:54,449
It's good.

1436
00:54:54,819 --> 00:54:55,989
It's so good.

1437
00:54:56,619 --> 00:54:58,589
(It's got a fiery taste to it.)

1438
00:54:59,349 --> 00:55:01,519
(When are you planning on doing the mission?)

1439
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:02,619
It's so good.

1440
00:55:02,619 --> 00:55:04,289
It is.

1441
00:55:04,519 --> 00:55:05,919
- Thank you. - Did you finish?

1442
00:55:05,919 --> 00:55:07,319
- Yes. - This is the mission.

1443
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:09,419
- What? - It's our mission.

1444
00:55:10,449 --> 00:55:12,219
- I'll do it. - We have to light it with one try.

1445
00:55:12,219 --> 00:55:14,089
- I'll go. - You both have to do it.

1446
00:55:14,689 --> 00:55:16,089
- Here I go. - You can't fail.

1447
00:55:16,089 --> 00:55:17,119
Let's go.

1448
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:18,619
Set, go!

1449
00:55:19,989 --> 00:55:21,019
Mission successful.

1450
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:23,149
I have to do it, too, right?

1451
00:55:23,149 --> 00:55:29,819
(Kwang Soo can't afford to fail now.)

1452
00:55:30,049 --> 00:55:31,189
(He lights it.)

1453
00:55:32,349 --> 00:55:34,919
(Kwang Soo succeeds from a single try.)

1454
00:55:34,919 --> 00:55:35,919
Mission success.

1455
00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:38,619
- Can you mark it on our bingo? - Okay.

1456
00:55:38,619 --> 00:55:40,819
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1457
00:55:40,949 --> 00:55:42,689
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1458
00:55:42,689 --> 00:55:43,919
Thank you for the food.

1459
00:55:43,919 --> 00:55:46,919
(They're headed to the tornado potatoes.)

1460
00:55:46,919 --> 00:55:48,889
- Let's go. - We need to find tornado potatoes.

1461
00:55:48,889 --> 00:55:50,989
I'll be with you in a minute.

1462
00:55:51,089 --> 00:55:52,589
Where are the tornado potatoes?

1463
00:55:52,589 --> 00:55:53,819
- There they are. Is this the place? - Yes.

1464
00:55:53,819 --> 00:55:55,389
- Hello. - Hello.

1465
00:55:55,589 --> 00:55:57,149
(They finally find the tornado potatoes place.)

1466
00:55:57,919 --> 00:55:58,919
What if this isn't the place?

1467
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:01,949
(They got their hands on tornado potatoes.)

1468
00:56:02,349 --> 00:56:03,349
There they are.

1469
00:56:05,449 --> 00:56:06,449
Can you feed me some?

1470
00:56:07,149 --> 00:56:08,149
Hello.

1471
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:09,349
Hello.

1472
00:56:09,619 --> 00:56:11,019
They must be doing a mission.

1473
00:56:11,619 --> 00:56:13,089
- Please. Just this once. - We finished it.

1474
00:56:14,449 --> 00:56:15,619
Oh, right.

1475
00:56:15,619 --> 00:56:17,349
Don't let them see.

1476
00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:18,419
What?

1477
00:56:18,419 --> 00:56:21,119
(For this mission, they have to juggle 3 potatoes at least 5 times.)

1478
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,749
It's a hard mission.

1479
00:56:23,149 --> 00:56:24,149
This is difficult than the one before.

1480
00:56:24,149 --> 00:56:25,789
They won't be able to do it, either.

1481
00:56:25,789 --> 00:56:26,789
How are we supposed to do this?

1482
00:56:28,149 --> 00:56:29,649
You have to stop them from making a bingo.

1483
00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:32,589
(Haha tries the juggling mission.)

1484
00:56:33,319 --> 00:56:34,319
(He drops them.)

1485
00:56:36,189 --> 00:56:37,219
What about us?

1486
00:56:37,749 --> 00:56:39,119
- Can you juggle, Jung Seok? - Yes.

1487
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,719
- Nice. - I'm good at juggling.

1488
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:41,789
Jung Seok is taking his jacket off.

1489
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:43,449
This is so unfair.

1490
00:56:43,719 --> 00:56:46,449
You can do it, Kyung Soo. You're on fire today.

1491
00:56:46,449 --> 00:56:47,589
I'm not sure.

1492
00:56:47,589 --> 00:56:52,689
(If they succeed this mission, they will get the Exchange Card.)

1493
00:56:52,689 --> 00:56:53,689
Start!

1494
00:56:55,889 --> 00:56:57,989
(He juggled twice.)

1495
00:56:57,989 --> 00:56:59,219
- Nice. - Okay.

1496
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:00,719
- It's our turn. - Is it hard?

1497
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:01,819
Give us the potatoes.

1498
00:57:02,189 --> 00:57:03,619
- We don't want a lot. - Thank you for the food.

1499
00:57:03,619 --> 00:57:05,519
- Thank you for the food. - This one is too good to pass.

1500
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:07,149
It's the only one left to make a bingo.

1501
00:57:07,149 --> 00:57:10,019
Jung Seok says he knows how to juggle.

1502
00:57:10,019 --> 00:57:12,019
(Jung Seok is apparently an experienced juggler.)

1503
00:57:12,019 --> 00:57:13,319
Please.

1504
00:57:13,819 --> 00:57:15,189
I haven't done it in a while.

1505
00:57:18,149 --> 00:57:21,049
Take your time, Jung Seok.

1506
00:57:21,049 --> 00:57:22,719
Is there anything he's not good at?

1507
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:24,719
Jung Seok is an amazing guy.

1508
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:25,849
He's amazing.

1509
00:57:27,189 --> 00:57:31,789
(Give me strength, potatoes.)

1510
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:36,049
(I have faith in you, Jung Seok.)

1511
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:40,149
(The potatoes are dancing in the air.)

1512
00:57:41,549 --> 00:57:42,549
- He did it. - Mission successful.

1513
00:57:42,549 --> 00:57:45,019
(Jung Seok succeeds the juggling mission.)

1514
00:57:45,689 --> 00:57:46,689
Yes!

1515
00:57:47,049 --> 00:57:49,719
Way to go. That was amazing.

1516
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:51,549
- We're doomed. - Thank you for the food.

1517
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:53,519
- Thank you. - We're done for.

1518
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:54,689
(They prevent Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo from making a bingo.)

1519
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:00,189
There's so much delicious food here.

1520
00:58:00,189 --> 00:58:02,219
- Look. It's chicken skewers. - Right.

1521
00:58:02,219 --> 00:58:03,449
- Welcome. - Hello.

1522
00:58:03,449 --> 00:58:05,089
Is this the place for the mission?

1523
00:58:05,089 --> 00:58:07,149
- That's right. - Okay.

1524
00:58:07,449 --> 00:58:08,889
(Play a game of palm wrestling against a different team and win.)

1525
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:10,119
It's palm wrestling.

1526
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:12,189
(They fuel up with some chicken skewers.)

1527
00:58:12,189 --> 00:58:13,219
Have some more.

1528
00:58:13,219 --> 00:58:16,349
(They fuel up with some chicken skewers.)

1529
00:58:16,349 --> 00:58:17,419
It's good.

1530
00:58:17,419 --> 00:58:18,819
Everything's delicious here.

1531
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:20,849
Kyung Soo.

1532
00:58:20,919 --> 00:58:22,389
Kyung Soo.

1533
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:24,589
We have to do this mission with someone else.

1534
00:58:24,589 --> 00:58:26,119
- Help us. - Sure. What is it?

1535
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:27,119
It's palm wrestling.

1536
00:58:27,149 --> 00:58:28,319
Let's go.

1537
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:31,519
(Will Jung Seok even be good at palm wrestling?)

1538
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:34,419
(I'm pretty strong myself.)

1539
00:58:36,519 --> 00:58:37,519
(Slapping)

1540
00:58:39,189 --> 00:58:40,189
Wait, what?

1541
00:58:40,189 --> 00:58:41,219
(Jae Seok helps him back up.)

1542
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:43,919
Wait, what? Is that even possible?

1543
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:45,689
- What's wrong? - It doesn't make sense.

1544
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:47,419
What are you talking about?

1545
00:58:47,419 --> 00:58:49,589
- Are you Neo from "Matrix"? - I'll show you one more time.

1546
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:53,319
- He's very flexible. - What was that?

1547
00:58:53,319 --> 00:58:55,119
He could even get back up from lying down.

1548
00:58:55,189 --> 00:58:56,919
That's right. He's flexible.

1549
00:58:56,919 --> 00:58:59,019
(They tease Kwang Soo with perfect teamwork.)

1550
00:58:59,049 --> 00:59:01,519
- He's flexible. - You're up, Kyung Soo.

1551
00:59:02,189 --> 00:59:03,319
- Let's go, Kyung Soo. - Jung Seok.

1552
00:59:03,819 --> 00:59:04,819
You can do it, Jung Seok.

1553
00:59:05,989 --> 00:59:07,019
Jung Seok.

1554
00:59:08,619 --> 00:59:09,619
Kyung Soo.

1555
00:59:11,389 --> 00:59:13,419
(We meet again.)

1556
00:59:13,419 --> 00:59:14,449
Let's go, Kyung Soo.

1557
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:17,849
- Kyung Soo. - Get him back.

1558
00:59:18,189 --> 00:59:19,419
He took the tornado potatoes mission from us.

1559
00:59:19,419 --> 00:59:20,589
Jung Seok.

1560
00:59:20,819 --> 00:59:21,819
Jung Seok.

1561
00:59:22,489 --> 00:59:23,789
(He dodges.)

1562
00:59:24,549 --> 00:59:28,319
(Will Kyung Soo be able to get his revenge on Jung Seok?)

1563
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:29,519
(He hugs him.)

1564
00:59:30,589 --> 00:59:32,689
(Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo succeed the mission.)

1565
00:59:32,689 --> 00:59:34,219
We did it!

1566
00:59:35,219 --> 00:59:37,419
- We won! - That was close.

1567
00:59:37,419 --> 00:59:38,589
We did it! We won.

1568
00:59:38,589 --> 00:59:40,689
(The brothers were brave.)

1569
00:59:42,689 --> 00:59:44,519
- Hello. - Hello, Ma'am.

1570
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:45,689
(They try their next mission.)

1571
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:47,689
(He's good at drawing.)

1572
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:49,349
Marilyn Monroe.

1573
00:59:49,689 --> 00:59:51,189
(They succeed the drawing mission with Kyung Soo's drawing.)

1574
00:59:51,189 --> 00:59:52,219
Thank you, Sir.

1575
00:59:53,019 --> 00:59:55,219
(If nobody gets a bingo, the team with the most missions wins.)

1576
00:59:55,219 --> 00:59:57,489
If we block everyone's bingo,

1577
00:59:57,619 --> 00:59:59,189
the team with the most missions done will win automatically.

1578
00:59:59,189 --> 01:00:00,319
You're right.

1579
01:00:00,449 --> 01:00:01,919
We did a lot so far.

1580
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,919
We did.

1581
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:05,149
This was a nail salon.

1582
01:00:05,249 --> 01:00:06,619
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1583
01:00:06,619 --> 01:00:08,119
(Exchange Card, here we come.)

1584
01:00:08,819 --> 01:00:10,819
The way I see it, we're done for.

1585
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:11,989
Just enjoy it, Jae Seok.

1586
01:00:11,989 --> 01:00:12,989
Let's do that.

1587
01:00:13,219 --> 01:00:14,589
Hurry.

1588
01:00:14,919 --> 01:00:15,949
Hurry up.

1589
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:17,519
Let's just...

1590
01:00:17,889 --> 01:00:20,849
watch other people shoot.

1591
01:00:20,889 --> 01:00:21,889
Jung Seok.

1592
01:00:21,889 --> 01:00:23,449
(Cheers, Jung Seok.)

1593
01:00:23,449 --> 01:00:26,049
We should eat. Let me know if you find something you want to try.

1594
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,119
Do you want some ox blood soup?

1595
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:30,119
Sounds good.

1596
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:32,249
- It's good for upset stomach. - Ox blood soup is the best.

1597
01:00:32,249 --> 01:00:34,189
Can we have some ox blood soup?

1598
01:00:34,189 --> 01:00:37,249
Ox blood soup is the best.

1599
01:00:37,419 --> 01:00:39,789
- Thank you. - Thank you for the food.

1600
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:42,789
- Eat up. - You too, Jae Seok.

1601
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:44,619
(We should at least eat if we're going to lose anyway.)

1602
01:00:46,089 --> 01:00:48,619
The game's not over yet, Jung Seok. Who knows?

1603
01:00:49,889 --> 01:00:51,189
(What is life?)

1604
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:54,619
I know we're in the worst possible situation,

1605
01:00:55,349 --> 01:00:57,119
- but you never know. - Right.

1606
01:00:57,189 --> 01:00:58,749
I hope people will watch my movie.

1607
01:01:00,789 --> 01:01:02,689
It'll all work out.

1608
01:01:02,689 --> 01:01:04,519
(Everything will be okay.)

1609
01:01:04,519 --> 01:01:08,789
(Their bromance is hotter than ox blood soup.)

1610
01:01:09,989 --> 01:01:11,319
(Kwang Soo's team has the most.)

1611
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:14,149
This is the place. This is it.

1612
01:01:14,149 --> 01:01:16,389
- Thank you. - Under 20 seconds,

1613
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:17,719
make the stickers stick on your face or your hand.

1614
01:01:19,319 --> 01:01:20,319
Let's go.

1615
01:01:20,419 --> 01:01:21,419
Ready, set, go.

1616
01:01:21,789 --> 01:01:24,489
Go like this and apply pressure.

1617
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:25,719
Use your nails, too.

1618
01:01:25,719 --> 01:01:27,689
(They rub the stickers carefully.)

1619
01:01:27,689 --> 01:01:28,689
Please.

1620
01:01:29,149 --> 01:01:30,149
Here.

1621
01:01:30,149 --> 01:01:32,219
(The stickers have to be printed clearly for both of them.)

1622
01:01:32,219 --> 01:01:33,219
Is that it?

1623
01:01:33,219 --> 01:01:34,519
Let's take it off.

1624
01:01:35,989 --> 01:01:37,389
Oh, gosh.

1625
01:01:38,149 --> 01:01:39,889
(You're in our way.)

1626
01:01:39,889 --> 01:01:41,349
- What... - I'm sorry.

1627
01:01:41,419 --> 01:01:43,149
If you fail, we'll try right after.

1628
01:01:44,019 --> 01:01:45,149
I did it.

1629
01:01:45,449 --> 01:01:47,619
(Kyung Soo succeeds once again.)

1630
01:01:47,619 --> 01:01:48,819
It should come off easily.

1631
01:01:48,819 --> 01:01:50,149
(Kwang Soo is the only one left.)

1632
01:01:50,149 --> 01:01:51,149
Take it off.

1633
01:01:51,149 --> 01:01:52,419
(Kwang Soo is the only one left.)

1634
01:01:52,419 --> 01:01:54,189
You failed.

1635
01:01:54,219 --> 01:01:55,219
We'll try now.

1636
01:01:55,449 --> 01:01:56,719
- It's okay. - What are we doing here?

1637
01:01:56,719 --> 01:01:58,349
You should've used a new sticker.

1638
01:01:58,689 --> 01:02:00,219
It didn't feel sticky.

1639
01:02:00,219 --> 01:02:01,219
(This is not good at all.)

1640
01:02:01,219 --> 01:02:02,289
If we do this mission, we'll get a bingo.

1641
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,919
- Let's go. - You just need to stay still.

1642
01:02:05,019 --> 01:02:06,519
- Give us some water. - We have 20 seconds, right?

1643
01:02:06,919 --> 01:02:08,419
Ready, set, go.

1644
01:02:08,419 --> 01:02:10,219
(Seok Jin and Jong Kook start their mission.)

1645
01:02:12,049 --> 01:02:13,189
(If they do this, they'll get a bingo.)

1646
01:02:13,189 --> 01:02:14,319
Please no.

1647
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:15,319
(If they fail, Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo could try again.)

1648
01:02:15,319 --> 01:02:16,489
If we stop their bingo, we'll win.

1649
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:20,319
- You don't rub it? - No.

1650
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,589
Just apply a lot of pressure.

1651
01:02:22,019 --> 01:02:23,419
You have to take it off now.

1652
01:02:23,419 --> 01:02:30,019
(How did they do?)

1653
01:02:30,489 --> 01:02:31,519
Oh, no.

1654
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:33,189
(Seok Jin failed already.)

1655
01:02:34,089 --> 01:02:35,589
- Yes! - We'll try next.

1656
01:02:35,589 --> 01:02:36,849
It didn't work.

1657
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,019
It's more difficult than you think.

1658
01:02:38,019 --> 01:02:39,319
If they fail again, we'll try once more.

1659
01:02:39,319 --> 01:02:41,049
- Do we both have to do it? - You have to take the plastic off.

1660
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:42,589
Oh, we had to take the plastic off.

1661
01:02:42,689 --> 01:02:45,519
(We didn't do that.)

1662
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:47,489
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

1663
01:02:47,619 --> 01:02:48,889
Shouldn't you know that?

1664
01:02:50,449 --> 01:02:52,519
- The plastic. - Ready, set, go!

1665
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:54,089
(Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo try for the second time.)

1666
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:56,449
You have to soak it completely.

1667
01:02:56,449 --> 01:02:58,189
We have to succeed.

1668
01:02:58,189 --> 01:03:00,219
(They try even more carefully this time.)

1669
01:03:00,219 --> 01:03:01,219
Stop!

1670
01:03:01,219 --> 01:03:02,819
- You have to take them off now. - Time's up.

1671
01:03:02,819 --> 01:03:04,949
(Will they be able...)

1672
01:03:04,949 --> 01:03:10,889
(to stop their bingo?)

1673
01:03:12,049 --> 01:03:13,319
(It's a success.)

1674
01:03:14,819 --> 01:03:17,819
(Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo did it.)

1675
01:03:17,819 --> 01:03:19,219
If we took the plastic off, we would've won.

1676
01:03:19,619 --> 01:03:20,819
(Seok Jin and Jong Kook fail to get a bingo.)

1677
01:03:20,819 --> 01:03:22,319
- Thank you. - We did it right in front of them.

1678
01:03:22,789 --> 01:03:24,189
(Nobody can make a bingo now.)

1679
01:03:24,189 --> 01:03:25,849
- We could've been able to do it. - Thank you, Sir.

1680
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:27,189
Thank you so much.

1681
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:28,689
This is so annoying.

1682
01:03:28,689 --> 01:03:29,949
(Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo win with the most missions done.)

1683
01:03:31,449 --> 01:03:35,119
The final mission is "Find the Matching Cards".

1684
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:37,649
If you have two matching cards,

1685
01:03:37,789 --> 01:03:39,649
discard them...

1686
01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:43,719
and take one of the cards the team on your left is holding.

1687
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:45,589
When you discard the cards,

1688
01:03:45,619 --> 01:03:47,519
you have to do the action written on the cards...

1689
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:49,119
to prove you discarded them.

1690
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:51,449
The team to discard all cards will avoid the penalty.

1691
01:03:51,449 --> 01:03:54,089
The team holding the penalty card at the very last moment...

1692
01:03:54,089 --> 01:03:55,219
will receive the penalty.

1693
01:03:55,219 --> 01:03:58,319
Kwang Soo will get the Exchange Card item.

1694
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:00,019
(The final race gets started.)

1695
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:04,149
- Let's begin. - Do we draw one now?

1696
01:04:04,249 --> 01:04:05,289
Kwang Soo's team goes first.

1697
01:04:05,419 --> 01:04:06,919
Do you want me to draw first?

1698
01:04:06,949 --> 01:04:07,989
Do it.

1699
01:04:08,089 --> 01:04:09,389
I will...

1700
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:13,489
take the second one from the right.

1701
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:14,689
- This one? - Yes.

1702
01:04:17,749 --> 01:04:18,919
(Which card did the unlucky Kwang Soo draw?)

1703
01:04:18,919 --> 01:04:20,819
Can we discard them right after we draw their cards?

1704
01:04:20,819 --> 01:04:22,589
Yes.

1705
01:04:22,719 --> 01:04:26,419
(They got the Charm Card.)

1706
01:04:26,419 --> 01:04:29,789
We'll... Let's see. Then this one should...

1707
01:04:30,089 --> 01:04:31,389
This one should...

1708
01:04:31,389 --> 01:04:33,119
Do we have to use them?

1709
01:04:34,049 --> 01:04:35,489
You should know this.

1710
01:04:35,549 --> 01:04:36,889
You should know this.

1711
01:04:37,319 --> 01:04:40,489
Throwing cards away can be rather disadvantageous sometimes.

1712
01:04:40,489 --> 01:04:42,219
Because you can be a target.

1713
01:04:42,219 --> 01:04:43,349
You shouldn't have told them.

1714
01:04:43,789 --> 01:04:45,849
I was foolish.

1715
01:04:46,589 --> 01:04:48,219
- We don't have to throw them away. - We don't have to?

1716
01:04:48,419 --> 01:04:49,749
You don't have to.

1717
01:04:49,749 --> 01:04:51,489
- Okay. - You don't need to.

1718
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:54,019
Is it our turn?

1719
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:55,149
You should choose one now.

1720
01:04:55,719 --> 01:04:58,589
It's from 1 to 5.

1721
01:04:58,589 --> 01:05:00,189
(It's Jae Seok and Jung Seok's turn to choose.)

1722
01:05:00,689 --> 01:05:05,689
(Will they be able to avoid the Penalty Card?)

1723
01:05:05,689 --> 01:05:06,789
(Jung Seok already has a Penalty Card.)

1724
01:05:06,789 --> 01:05:07,919
- I'll designate one. - Go ahead.

1725
01:05:07,919 --> 01:05:10,189
- I know you're nervous. - It's 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

1726
01:05:10,289 --> 01:05:12,549
It's 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

1727
01:05:12,549 --> 01:05:14,449
(What will he choose?)

1728
01:05:14,449 --> 01:05:16,219
I'll pick the third one.

1729
01:05:16,219 --> 01:05:17,819
- This one? - The one in the middle.

1730
01:05:17,819 --> 01:05:20,649
- He looks disappointed. - Wait a moment.

1731
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:22,389
Wait a moment.

1732
01:05:24,049 --> 01:05:26,689
(Good. Think again, Jung Seok.)

1733
01:05:28,349 --> 01:05:29,819
- Give it to me. I'll take it. - Give it to him.

1734
01:05:29,819 --> 01:05:32,119
Give it to him.

1735
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:34,389
- Give him the one in the middle. - Give it to him.

1736
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:38,089
Jung Seok completely conned them.

1737
01:05:39,049 --> 01:05:41,289
- What should they do? - You can see ours now.

1738
01:05:42,089 --> 01:05:43,819
(Let's throw ours away.)

1739
01:05:43,819 --> 01:05:44,919
We will...

1740
01:05:44,919 --> 01:05:47,789
(They can throw away two Kiss on the Cheek Cards.)

1741
01:05:47,789 --> 01:05:49,719
(They pretend to kiss each other.)

1742
01:05:49,719 --> 01:05:51,289
We will throw them away.

1743
01:05:52,889 --> 01:05:53,949
(They threw them away.)

1744
01:05:53,949 --> 01:05:55,289
- Okay. - Oh my.

1745
01:05:55,819 --> 01:05:57,449
Then let's shuffle them.

1746
01:05:57,819 --> 01:05:59,589
I can't tell because they're upside down.

1747
01:05:59,589 --> 01:06:02,049
- Gosh. - You hold them.

1748
01:06:02,049 --> 01:06:04,349
- I don't want to choose something. - I understand.

1749
01:06:04,749 --> 01:06:06,749
(Where is the Penalty Card?)

1750
01:06:06,749 --> 01:06:09,849
- Pick one. - Everyone is disguising very well.

1751
01:06:09,849 --> 01:06:12,819
- There are two bombs among them. - He may pick a Penalty Card.

1752
01:06:12,849 --> 01:06:13,989
We don't know it, either.

1753
01:06:13,989 --> 01:06:15,949
You may have to have two Penalty Cards.

1754
01:06:16,089 --> 01:06:18,019
- All look like Penalty Cards. - I don't want to choose one.

1755
01:06:18,019 --> 01:06:19,949
- I understand. - Let's go with the middle one.

1756
01:06:20,449 --> 01:06:21,689
(The card in the middle?)

1757
01:06:21,689 --> 01:06:23,289
- Okay. - He hides them well.

1758
01:06:23,289 --> 01:06:25,049
It was easy for you to see.

1759
01:06:25,049 --> 01:06:26,389
I'll let you know.

1760
01:06:27,949 --> 01:06:29,319
Pass it to me. I'll look at it.

1761
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:30,489
(Let's see.)

1762
01:06:30,489 --> 01:06:32,449
(We can't tell from Jung Seok's face.)

1763
01:06:33,319 --> 01:06:35,219
(The card Seok Jin and Jong Kook brought is...)

1764
01:06:35,219 --> 01:06:36,719
Please let me see.

1765
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:37,849
(The card Seok Jin and Jong Kook brought is...)

1766
01:06:37,849 --> 01:06:38,949
This is insane.

1767
01:06:38,949 --> 01:06:42,049
(It's a Penalty Card.)

1768
01:06:42,049 --> 01:06:43,919
(It is a Penalty Card.)

1769
01:06:43,919 --> 01:06:45,049
Oh my.

1770
01:06:45,049 --> 01:06:46,719
(It is a Penalty Card.)

1771
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:48,419
(They want to laugh out loud.)

1772
01:06:48,419 --> 01:06:50,619
(Show Your Individual Skills Card and Tour around Daegu Card)

1773
01:06:50,619 --> 01:06:54,119
We're heading toward the end.

1774
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:56,119
They were Forehead Kiss Cards.

1775
01:06:56,519 --> 01:06:58,219
- I'll use the Exchange Card. - Okay.

1776
01:06:58,519 --> 01:06:59,719
Give it to me.

1777
01:06:59,719 --> 01:07:01,989
- Suit yourself. - I like the exchange.

1778
01:07:02,689 --> 01:07:05,589
We're almost heading toward the end.

1779
01:07:05,589 --> 01:07:08,349
- It's almost the end. - Does it end if you have two bombs?

1780
01:07:08,749 --> 01:07:10,389
Among 1, 2 and 3.

1781
01:07:11,219 --> 01:07:12,489
Pick one.

1782
01:07:12,489 --> 01:07:14,119
(Haha and Ji Hyo have to choose one.)

1783
01:07:14,119 --> 01:07:15,189
I'll choose number three.

1784
01:07:16,089 --> 01:07:17,149
Here.

1785
01:07:17,149 --> 01:07:18,249
Take a look.

1786
01:07:18,249 --> 01:07:21,249
(Haha and Ji Hyo only had a Penalty Card.)

1787
01:07:21,249 --> 01:07:22,989
(What did they choose?)

1788
01:07:22,989 --> 01:07:24,789
Good job, Haha.

1789
01:07:25,819 --> 01:07:27,189
Did you see that? You can do it, too.

1790
01:07:27,189 --> 01:07:29,349
You haven't tried that yet.

1791
01:07:29,549 --> 01:07:31,519
Right?

1792
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:34,519
You look desperate.

1793
01:07:34,989 --> 01:07:37,389
I thought it would be over soon.

1794
01:07:38,019 --> 01:07:42,189
If you have two matching cards, you can throw them away and end it.

1795
01:07:42,189 --> 01:07:44,749
(Will it be a Penalty Card or the same card?)

1796
01:07:44,789 --> 01:07:47,249
- But it can be a Penalty Card. - Right.

1797
01:07:48,019 --> 01:07:51,689
(Haha and Ji Hyo actually have two Penalty Cards.)

1798
01:07:54,849 --> 01:07:56,889
(They're anticipating.)

1799
01:07:57,719 --> 01:07:59,389
Look at Kwang Soo's expression.

1800
01:08:00,049 --> 01:08:02,719
(They got the Penalty Card again.)

1801
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:04,119
It must be a Penalty Card.

1802
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:05,249
(It must be a Penalty Card.)

1803
01:08:05,249 --> 01:08:06,319
(Your misery is our joy.)

1804
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:08,189
His expression changed suddenly.

1805
01:08:08,189 --> 01:08:09,849
- I'll shuffle them. - I saw your expression.

1806
01:08:10,289 --> 01:08:11,719
We're in trouble now.

1807
01:08:11,719 --> 01:08:13,049
(Jung Seok might pick the Penalty Card.)

1808
01:08:13,049 --> 01:08:14,619
They need to throw the cards away.

1809
01:08:14,619 --> 01:08:16,959
The upper one is 1 and the lower one is 2.

1810
01:08:16,959 --> 01:08:18,519
- That's right. - Jung Seok, pick one.

1811
01:08:18,749 --> 01:08:21,319
- One or two. - I'm so unlucky. You saw me, right?

1812
01:08:21,749 --> 01:08:24,219
- I can see your cards. - Take what you want.

1813
01:08:24,849 --> 01:08:26,089
- One or two. - Should I pick one again?

1814
01:08:26,089 --> 01:08:27,349
- Do it. - I feel anxious.

1815
01:08:27,349 --> 01:08:28,789
- Suddenly, I feel anxious. - One or two.

1816
01:08:28,789 --> 01:08:29,889
(It's a 50 percent chance.)

1817
01:08:29,889 --> 01:08:31,419
I feel so worried.

1818
01:08:31,919 --> 01:08:33,789
Your nails are so pretty.

1819
01:08:33,789 --> 01:08:36,019
(What's Jung Seok's choice?)

1820
01:08:36,019 --> 01:08:39,119
(What is the last card Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo has?)

1821
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:42,089
Look at Kwang Soo. I can read your mind.

1822
01:08:43,019 --> 01:08:44,319
(They glance at it.)

1823
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:47,219
Look at Kwang Soo. I can read your mind.

1824
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:49,049
(It's the Penalty Card.)

1825
01:08:49,749 --> 01:08:52,149
(How unfortunate.)

1826
01:08:52,149 --> 01:08:54,219
- This is 1 and this is 2. - Did you see it?

1827
01:08:54,349 --> 01:08:55,349
One and two.

1828
01:08:55,349 --> 01:08:58,349
(The Penalty Cards go around and around.)

1829
01:08:58,349 --> 01:09:00,619
They're 1 and 2.

1830
01:09:00,849 --> 01:09:02,219
- We'll take the upper one. - The upper one?

1831
01:09:02,219 --> 01:09:03,919
- Yes. - Let's see.

1832
01:09:04,819 --> 01:09:05,959
Okay.

1833
01:09:05,959 --> 01:09:08,959
(In whose hand is the Penalty Card?)

1834
01:09:08,959 --> 01:09:11,519
(He takes a deep breath.)

1835
01:09:11,519 --> 01:09:15,919
(What Jong Kook picked is the tenacious Penalty Card.)

1836
01:09:15,919 --> 01:09:18,489
(He got the Penalty Card.)

1837
01:09:18,489 --> 01:09:20,089
You can choose the card this time.

1838
01:09:21,789 --> 01:09:23,689
Why? Did you tolerate a lot?

1839
01:09:23,689 --> 01:09:25,389
"What should I do?"

1840
01:09:25,889 --> 01:09:27,959
- I get to think a lot. - What should I do with him?

1841
01:09:28,389 --> 01:09:30,959
- What should I do? - What should I do?

1842
01:09:30,959 --> 01:09:32,989
- What should I do with him? - Look.

1843
01:09:32,989 --> 01:09:35,019
- It's 1, 2 and 3. - Okay.

1844
01:09:36,619 --> 01:09:38,489
- This one? - Number one.

1845
01:09:39,519 --> 01:09:41,719
Let's not look.

1846
01:09:42,049 --> 01:09:44,089
- I won't see it. - I won't, either.

1847
01:09:44,089 --> 01:09:46,289
- Let's leave them as they are. - There must be something important.

1848
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:48,219
There must be something important.

1849
01:09:48,219 --> 01:09:50,459
If I win, let's choose that one. And if you win, pick this one.

1850
01:09:50,459 --> 01:09:52,689
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1851
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:53,819
- The left one, please. - This one?

1852
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:56,419
- I didn't see it. - Me neither.

1853
01:09:56,419 --> 01:09:57,549
(The Penalty Card can make it back to square one.)

1854
01:09:57,549 --> 01:09:59,719
- Look at that. - Is this the end?

1855
01:09:59,719 --> 01:10:05,119
(Will the fortune be on Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo's side?)

1856
01:10:11,649 --> 01:10:13,019
Yes.

1857
01:10:13,219 --> 01:10:14,519
(He screams.)

1858
01:10:16,519 --> 01:10:19,119
(Show Your Individual Skills Card finally meets its pair.)

1859
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:21,049
Did you find the pair?

1860
01:10:21,049 --> 01:10:22,919
- They must be a pair. - They seem so.

1861
01:10:24,749 --> 01:10:25,889
This is incredible.

1862
01:10:26,189 --> 01:10:28,549
(They're the first ones to escape the penalty.)

1863
01:10:28,549 --> 01:10:30,189
In 1, 2, 3, 4.

1864
01:10:30,189 --> 01:10:32,459
A huge mosquito bit me at night

1865
01:10:32,589 --> 01:10:36,249
It was itchy so I scratched a lot

1866
01:10:36,549 --> 01:10:37,819
(They look cute.)

1867
01:10:38,019 --> 01:10:39,649
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1868
01:10:39,649 --> 01:10:42,019
(Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo placed the first.)

1869
01:10:42,019 --> 01:10:43,489
(The brothers were brave.)

1870
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:45,749
- Congratulations. - We're done, too.

1871
01:10:46,019 --> 01:10:47,349
- Congratulations. - It's over.

1872
01:10:47,349 --> 01:10:48,589
- My gosh. - Well done.

1873
01:10:49,089 --> 01:10:51,249
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1874
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:52,819
You're finished consecutively.

1875
01:10:52,819 --> 01:10:54,919
We're finished, too.

1876
01:10:54,919 --> 01:10:56,419
- We are. - Finished.

1877
01:10:56,519 --> 01:10:58,019
- Here. - Here.

1878
01:10:58,019 --> 01:10:59,519
It's over. We're done.

1879
01:10:59,519 --> 01:11:01,289
- You should take this. - Yes.

1880
01:11:01,289 --> 01:11:03,149
If you take this, it's over.

1881
01:11:03,149 --> 01:11:04,719
- If you take this. - They finish consecutively.

1882
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:05,819
It's over.

1883
01:11:05,819 --> 01:11:07,619
(They pass the Penalty Card to Haha and Ji Hyo.)

1884
01:11:07,619 --> 01:11:09,719
We should have done that before.

1885
01:11:09,959 --> 01:11:12,919
- Kyung Soo's Exchange Card was... - That was awesome.

1886
01:11:13,719 --> 01:11:15,319
- He did very well. - We made it.

1887
01:11:15,319 --> 01:11:16,789
We were unlucky until the end.

1888
01:11:16,789 --> 01:11:17,849
I'm relieved.

1889
01:11:17,849 --> 01:11:19,319
We had ox blood soup together before.

1890
01:11:19,319 --> 01:11:21,319
I feel bad for them.

1891
01:11:22,549 --> 01:11:23,819
They pay for it straight away.

1892
01:11:23,819 --> 01:11:25,459
(The prompt and sacred ceremony of paying the bill)

1893
01:11:25,459 --> 01:11:27,219
- How much? - It's 446 dollars.

1894
01:11:27,219 --> 01:11:30,389
- Since he owns... - Since he owns a store...

1895
01:11:30,389 --> 01:11:32,189
(He's used to that device.)

1896
01:11:32,189 --> 01:11:33,319
(The total is 446 dollars.)

1897
01:11:33,319 --> 01:11:36,389
- Thank you. - They paid 446 dollars.

1898
01:11:37,719 --> 01:11:40,289
Jung Seok and Kyung Soo, you did a good job, too.

1899
01:11:41,019 --> 01:11:42,019
Thank you.

1900
01:11:42,019 --> 01:11:43,089
(Thank you for your great bromance.)

1901
01:11:43,349 --> 01:11:45,589
(Twice will be here next week.)

1902
01:11:45,989 --> 01:11:50,589
(Every member of the group is pretty.)

1903
01:11:50,589 --> 01:11:52,019
(It's Twice.)

1904
01:11:52,019 --> 01:11:53,019
I'm just happy.

1905
01:11:53,019 --> 01:11:54,889
(They're cute, little girls.)
