1
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,140
(Previously on Running Man)

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,630
(Will you be together or apart?)

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,440
(Their decisions resulted in terrifying outcomes.)

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,570
(This nerve-wracking challenge depends on probability.)

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,870
(Will the probability take them to somewhere nice or bad?)

6
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,570
It's Probability Race. This game can get you 50R coins.

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,070
We are at Nambu Market which is a famous place in Jeonju.

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,130
(The mission in the market will be "Find the Consonants".)

9
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,930
We took each consonant from the name of the market. You must...

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,670
buy 5 things with the consonants. You must use at least 2 of them.

11
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,030
(They must buy 5 things, but 2 of the consonants must be used.)

12
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,670
- What are those? - We need to wear them?

13
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,200
You will wear one of them and start your mission.

14
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,940
The thread of the clothes will be unraveled.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,840
That's how far we'll be able to go.

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,670
Yes, the distant you will travel will be limited.

17
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,400
- We can't go far. - That sounds fun.

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,840
- This time... - We need to split.

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,270
- We should be apart. - Of course.

20
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,270
- This makes sense. - We can't do anything about this.

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,940
- That's right. - Why don't we start?

22
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,300
I'll go first this time.

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,770
- Kwang Soo, which one do you want? - I want the third one.

24
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:12,770
Okay.

25
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,100
I can already feel the misfortune.

26
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,410
Two, three, four, five...

27
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,840
- Please, be large. - Get the small one.

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,410
- Get the small one. - Be the small one.

29
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,600
(What will unfortunate Kwang Soo face this time?)

30
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,340
(What a surprise. He gets the costume in large.)

31
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,570
Yes!

32
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,470
But this isn't all that great.

33
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,500
- It is. - He can go far.

34
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,540
Going far is better.

35
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,040
- Can you go back to your place? - Move, Kwang Soo.

36
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,840
- Can a man celebrate? - Move.

37
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,840
- Go back to your spot. - Why would you celebrate?

38
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,270
- Let me celebrate. - You don't need to.

39
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,470
It's not necessary.

40
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,470
- What number was Kwang Soo? - Three.

41
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,700
- Okay, I choose number one. - Okay.

42
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,240
(There's less chance to get a large. It'd be good to draw a medium.)

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,840
Small, small, small.

44
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,440
Small.

45
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,370
- Small. - Small.

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
(I knew it.)

47
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,440
This is so strange.

48
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,270
(The unlucky guys approve of Jae Seok's bad luck.)

49
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,770
Only one of the three of us gets to be lucky.

50
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,770
That's right. Only one of us can make it.

51
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,870
- Only one of us can be lucky. - Just one.

52
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,370
- Okay. - I'll break the jinx.

53
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,370
I choose number two.

54
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,310
(It's time for Seok Jin to draw.)

55
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,000
Please be large.

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,740
(Unlucky Seok Jin has been quite fortunate today.)

57
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,870
- Okay. - He got the large one.

58
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,870
(Seok Jin gets large.)

59
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,240
- Okay. - He got the large one.

60
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,940
- You just get a longer distance. - It's not that big of a deal.

61
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,940
(He only gets lucky with things that aren't very important.)

62
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,640
It'll take that much more time to come back.

63
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,270
(He only gets lucky with things that aren't very important.)

64
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,940
I'm going next. I choose number four.

65
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,000
Number four?

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,870
(It's time for Jong Kook to draw.)

67
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,000
- He got the small one. - That means we get the medium ones.

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
(Jong Kook gets medium.)

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,670
Regardless of the size,

70
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,400
I wouldn't be able bear the sight of Jong Kook wearing it.

71
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,770
(Jong Kook in a bikini will be an eyesore.)

72
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,000
Imagine him dressed in that.

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,740
Automatically, Ji Hyo and Haha will get the costumes in medium.

74
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,300
Gosh.

75
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,900
(Size of the costume and the amount of cash in possession.)

76
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,100
I only have five dollars. They can do whatever they want.

77
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,470
Will you even be able to do the mission with five dollars?

78
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,670
I'm going to take my time and look around on my way out.

79
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,500
He's so cheeky. Gosh.

80
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,940
(Jae Seok is carefree with his 150 dollars.)

81
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,400
Gosh, he makes me mad.

82
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,270
(What can I buy with 100 dollars?)

83
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,200
(The threads are tied to a pole.)

84
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,570
Please tie the threads.

85
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,570
(The threads are tied to a pole.)

86
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,040
Ready, set, go!

87
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,740
(The mission begins.)

88
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,500
- It unravels so fast. - It does.

89
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,000
- Look at this. - We're in trouble.

90
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,340
It's unraveling.

91
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,900
Even with the costume in large, this is going to be hard.

92
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,100
(The moment the thread breaks, you're out.)

93
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,300
- Hold on. - This isn't looking good.

94
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,100
(Will they be able to cover the area with those costumes?)

95
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,700
It's almost gone now.

96
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,670
The thread is...

97
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,400
(It's tight already.)

98
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,270
This isn't going to work. Hold on.

99
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,570
I don't have much left. I can't go any further.

100
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,540
Jae Seok. Jae Seok.

101
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,570
What?

102
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,470
(Whose thread is that?)

103
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,340
- Whose is that? - That's mine. Hey!

104
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,040
Wait. That's mine. Hey!

105
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,700
(Seok Jin has a mishap while shopping.)

106
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,040
What are you doing with my thread?

107
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,500
(Wait, this isn't mine.)

108
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,470
Ma'am, do you have mushrooms?

109
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,640
How much is this?

110
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,300
All of it?

111
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,340
Can I get just one of them?

112
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,700
How much is that?

113
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,140
- You want three of these? - Yes.

114
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,200
- I can't charge you for three. - You have to take my money.

115
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,500
- Should I put them in there? - Yes.

116
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,900
I'm sorry. Thank you, Ma'am.

117
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,840
Thank you. I got mushrooms.

118
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,840
(She purchases 3 mushrooms.)

119
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,400
- Mushroom. - It's over there.

120
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,400
(Jae Seok has 150 dollars.)

121
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,640
Where are they?

122
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,040
I can't go further than the thread allows me.

123
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,870
(He's got the money, but not the thread.)

124
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,140
If the thread breaks, it's game over.

125
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,610
I can't go further than the thread allows me.

126
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,000
- How much are they? - A dollar for three.

127
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,540
- A dollar? - I'll get them for you.

128
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,040
Thank you.

129
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,300
I can't go any further without the thread.

130
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,300
(A kind person buys the mushrooms for him.)

131
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,800
Thank you.

132
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,900
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,300
Come look over here.

134
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,370
I can't go any further.

135
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,140
(The threads are getting tighter.)

136
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,900
(Jong Kook's costume is almost gone now.)

137
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,070
Did you say two dollars?

138
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,840
If the thread breaks, it's game over.

139
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,440
I can work with this.

140
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,540
Where's the shop keeper?

141
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,000
Hello. I did it.

142
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,540
What? Oh, right, the change.

143
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,100
Thank you.

144
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,840
I did it. Let's go.

145
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,840
(Jong Kook purchases Korean socks.)

146
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,370
(Meanwhile, Seok Jin only has 5 dollars to spend.)

147
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,900
There are pants here.

148
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,300
How much are the cheapest pair of pants?

149
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,400
Five dollars.

150
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,940
The cheapest one is five dollars?

151
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,770
(The cheapest one costs his entire saving.)

152
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,900
There's sujebi. Do you have sujebi on the menu?

153
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,200
You do? How much is it?

154
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,940
- It's 6 dollars. - Did you say 6 dollars?

155
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,000
(The price has gone up at the market.)

156
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,200
Sujebi is six dollars.

157
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,100
Do you have Korean socks?

158
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:15,870
(Kwang Soo has a big costume, but not a lot of money.)

159
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Hello.

160
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,400
Do you have soju?

161
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,500
This is distilled soju.

162
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,940
Okay. Can you...

163
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,840
- But it's already been opened. - That's okay.

164
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,200
I have to pay for this.

165
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,900
Thank you.

166
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,900
(What a frugal celebrity.)

167
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,770
Needle.

168
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,940
Hello. Do you have needles?

169
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,300
(He goes to a props store to ask for a needle.)

170
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,970
Thank you. How much is it?

171
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,640
For a single needle?

172
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,300
- Yes. - I'll take a dollar.

173
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,900
Thank you.

174
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,940
(He's a celebrity who deals in used items.)

175
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,900
Thank you very much.

176
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,940
(Kwang Soo purchases soju and a needle.)

177
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,270
I got two items.

178
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,570
What's next?

179
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,940
(Let me take a look in your basket.)

180
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,500
What have you got in there?

181
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,800
(Let me take a look in your basket.)

182
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,440
What's in there, Seok Jin? Let me take a look.

183
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,800
Do you want to exchange things?

184
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Okay. What do you have?

185
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,200
- Copying paper? Pants? - Soju.

186
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,140
- Pants. - We should buy pants.

187
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,340
I gave you too many hints.

188
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,370
Aren't you the father of the twins?

189
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,740
(Aren't you the father of the twins?)

190
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,900
(Aren't you Lee Hwi Jae, the comedian?)

191
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,400
I'm not Lee Hwi Jae.

192
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,670
I'm not him.

193
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,370
Is there a stationery store around here?

194
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,100
Where's the stationery store?

195
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,670
- There are so many things here. - Five minutes remaining.

196
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,300
There are five minutes remaining for the mission.

197
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,170
- I need to get one more thing. - Okay.

198
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
(Haha bought mushroom, octopus, pot, and Korean socks.)

199
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,470
Thank you.

200
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,540
It's two dollars? I'll have one of these.

201
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,270
I'll have the box.

202
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,240
This is nice.

203
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,370
(Haha finished purchasing and is on his way back.)

204
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,600
I have to get there quickly.

205
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,870
(What's this?)

206
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,800
It won't untangle.

207
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,840
I finished the mission.

208
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,000
(He's stopped by the tangled threads.)

209
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,040
This might break.

210
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,670
Hold on.

211
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,940
I have to go, but it won't untangle.

212
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,640
It worked. Where do I go?

213
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,500
(It was close, but he's back after purchasing 5 items.)

214
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,770
I did it.

215
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,770
Thank you very much.

216
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,400
I got them all.

217
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
(Jae Seok is on his way back.)

218
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Hello.

219
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,210
(Jae Seok is on his way back.)

220
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh, no.

221
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,710
(The thread breaks.)

222
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,710
Kwon Ryeol...

223
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,740
Mission failed.

224
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,670
Kwon Ryeol stepped on it.

225
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,470
This isn't fair. He stepped on it.

226
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,170
Kwon Ryeol stepped on the thread.

227
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,300
I'm sorry, but you have failed the mission.

228
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,040
I said Kwon Ryeol stepped on it.

229
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,640
(You're supposed to tape me, not step on my thread.)

230
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,640
Hey!

231
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,840
He stepped on it.

232
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,840
(He's sorry and embarrassed.)

233
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,710
Gosh, Kwon Ryeol.

234
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,740
What's wrong with you?

235
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,570
I know this is your money, but how could you do this?

236
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,800
(Kwon Ryeol ruined an almost successful mission.)

237
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,040
Follow me for now.

238
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,500
(Kwon Ryeol ruined an almost successful mission.)

239
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,770
Kwon Ryeol, you...

240
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,270
(Laughing)

241
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,210
(Is this funny to you?)

242
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,770
("Find the Consonants" is over.)

243
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,210
(The result of Market Tour)

244
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,670
(Items purchased and the amount of R coins they have)

245
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,770
(Only Haha and Kwang Soo succeeded the mission.)

246
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,300
I'll inform you on the amount of R coins you currently have.

247
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,340
Jae Seok has 20R. He gets Jeonju Seasoned Laver Set.

248
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,670
Seok Jin has 10R. He gets Jeonju Handmade Paper Fan.

249
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,000
Jong Kook has 40R. He gets Crude Liquor Set.

250
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,170
Haha has 80R. He gets Tteokgalbi Set.

251
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,900
Ji Hyo has 30R. She gets Crude Liquor Set.

252
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,300
Kwang Soo has 90R. He gets Tteokgalbi Set.

253
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,240
If only I had 10R more.

254
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,740
- What did you say? - If only I had 10R more.

255
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,470
(If he had that, he could've gotten a laptop.)

256
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,040
(It's time to exchange the R coins for the prizes.)

257
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,270
We'll give you prizes according to the R coins you have.

258
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,210
Before that, there is one last choice to make.

259
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,000
- What is it? - Will you...

260
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,500
combine the R coins or will you be apart?

261
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,300
(Will you combine the R coins or will you be apart?)

262
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,740
We should combine our coins and go to Europe.

263
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,470
- We should combine them. - This is an obvious choice.

264
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,100
- We have to combine them. - I mean...

265
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,570
- We have to combine them. - There's no need to think.

266
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,770
(The poor want to combine the R coins.)

267
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,400
We have to go for the big prize.

268
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,800
What good will that be?

269
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,840
What am I supposed to do with this?

270
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,000
I'll buy you one.

271
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,170
You have to dream big.

272
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,210
Let me hit you on the forehead, then.

273
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,770
It'll be unfair without it.

274
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,800
I'll do Jong Kook. I'll give you 90R for that.

275
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,940
- Come on. - Just do it.

276
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,300
- I'll give you 90R. - Let him hit you.

277
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,800
I'll buy your forehead for 80R.

278
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,300
I'll top that with 10 more.

279
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
- What did you say? - I said 10R.

280
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,300
Haha said 80 and I said 90.

281
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,470
He has 10 more than me.

282
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,100
I'm saying that I have 90R and Haha has 80R.

283
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,370
- Fine. Let's do it. - Okay.

284
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,600
- Let's do this. - Give it to me.

285
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,200
I don't understand why I have to do this.

286
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,370
- I'm not doing it. - Come on.

287
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,700
What are you going to do with a Crude Liquor Set?

288
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,170
I don't want to do this. Why do I have to get hit?

289
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,000
I don't want to do this.

290
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,640
Why should I let you hit me?

291
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,000
Because of the way you're behaving.

292
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,140
(Don't you know why?)

293
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,870
That's why I want to hit you.

294
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,740
You always hit me.

295
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm willing to pay 90R for a chance to hit you.

296
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
(Dazed)

297
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,940
- I have 40R. - We could go to LA with this.

298
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,340
- Which is why I'll give you 50R. - Calm down.

299
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,370
- Let's do this. - Let's combine the coins for now.

300
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,200
I can't promise anything.

301
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:45,500
(The winner gets a plane ticket to Europe.)

302
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,300
(A dud means everyone loses everything.)

303
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,500
Who'll spin the wheel?

304
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,240
- I will. I'm unlucky. - Okay.

305
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,400
- He won't win it for himself. - Okay, you spin.

306
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,470
He's unlucky.

307
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,900
If you get a dud, the crew will collect the prizes.

308
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,170
- I'll spin. - Okay.

309
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,900
On 1, 2, 3.

310
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,940
(Who's the one lucky person Kwang Soo will select?)

311
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,540
We all stand a chance.

312
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:12,800
(Will someone win a plane ticket? Or will they lose everything?)

313
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,740
It's me.

314
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,270
- It's me. - Haha!

315
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,540
(Really? Haha?)

316
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,600
(They thought the wheel stopped, but it's still moving.)

317
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,940
No, no!

318
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,840
(Stop! The next cell is a dud!)

319
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,100
(It landed on a dud.)

320
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,740
(No way.)

321
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,870
Wasn't it me?

322
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,440
Did you nudge the wheel?

323
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,200
(He's innocent.)

324
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,370
Sorry, Haha.

325
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,700
I didn't nudge it!

326
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,000
Calm down.

327
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,470
Let's try spinning the wheel again.

328
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,370
I really didn't nudge it!

329
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,370
(The dud brought out their best manners.)

330
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,440
I bet someone will win now.

331
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,800
Because it doesn't count.

332
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,540
- This is an unlucky day. - See?

333
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,000
Haha won.

334
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,300
(Oh dear.)

335
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,500
Gosh, Haha.

336
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,540
Good on you, Haha.

337
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,240
You almost won.

338
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,600
- I'm very impressed. - You almost won.

339
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,100
What a pity.

340
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,670
This isn't the end of it.

341
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,240
Head to the guest house and fight to win...

342
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,270
- your last chance. - Let's go.

343
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,470
We lost everything. Absolutely everything.

344
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,340
(Jeonju Tour Part 2)

345
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,170
(The Culture Institute is a great example of our culture.)

346
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,770
(There are yet more prizes on the table.)

347
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,500
- Look. - There are more prizes.

348
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,900
Is it not over yet?

349
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,670
We have nothing.

350
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,540
- They keep tossing us bait. - We really have nothing.

351
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,140
I had 90R.

352
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,700
You must be upset about losing everything.

353
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,600
- We are. - Pick whichever donut you want...

354
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,100
- and eat it. - Can we eat one?

355
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,670
- Are they filled with wasabi? - No.

356
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,870
Are you sure?

357
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,240
(We're suspicious.)

358
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,340
Can we eat them?

359
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,640
(But we'll eat.)

360
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,440
We're being sorted into teams.

361
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,440
(Let's eat when we can.)

362
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,770
(Jae Seok chose a chocolate donut.)

363
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,070
Eat a red one.

364
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,570
No, I prefer chocolate.

365
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,140
They're sorting us.

366
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,970
I don't want to be on his team.

367
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,440
(Grab)

368
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,740
(I'll avoid the tiger and join the chocolate team.)

369
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,870
(The tiger can go to the strawberry team.)

370
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,740
We'll begin the part two of the tour where you can...

371
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,740
make up for the prizes you lost.

372
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,740
You'll be split into two teams...

373
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,800
depending on the color of the donut you ate.

374
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,170
Really?

375
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,440
- See? - The unlucky guys unite.

376
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,070
(The Unlucky Trio unites)

377
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,400
I wanted a chocolate donut.

378
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
While eating my chocolate donut, I thought,

379
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,770
"How will I fare with these losers?"

380
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,770
But then I prefer them to you.

381
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,870
(Better the losers than the tiger)

382
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,570
Is that what you really thought?

383
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,740
I thought...

384
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,670
You are now in 2 teams of 3.

385
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,070
- The Unlucky Trio's back. - How did this happen?

386
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,240
Because you've all been unlucky today, the Jeonju Fairies...

387
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,440
are here to share some of their luck with you.

388
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,300
(Jeonju Fairies? Who are they?)

389
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,440
(Who is this huge welcome for?)

390
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:33,400
(Who are the fairies of luck who have come to help the members?)

391
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,440
(It's the hugely popular group Blackpink.)

392
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,800
(They topped the charts shortly after their debut.)

393
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,170
(They're as talented as they are beautiful.)

394
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,270
I can't believe I got to meet Blackpink.

395
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,400
They really are fairies.

396
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,300
- Welcome. - Hello, we're Blackpink.

397
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,440
- They look so chic. - They're awesome.

398
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,400
YG Entertainment cares about looks now.

399
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,300
It's "Playing with Fire"!

400
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,470
"Playing with Fire"!

401
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,140
("Playing with Fire" by Blackpink)

402
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,500
This is incredible.

403
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,370
I can't believe this.

404
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,970
(They light the whole of Jeonju with their chic looks.)

405
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,670
They look much better in real life.

406
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,140
I can't pick.

407
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,700
Look at them.

408
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,240
They look like dolls.

409
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,470
(She smiled at me.)

410
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:23,200
(Just looking at them washes away the unlucky feeling.)

411
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,270
They have the city look.

412
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,370
- They look so haughty. - No way.

413
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,670
- Look. - Look at them!

414
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,440
- They look so haughty. - No way.

415
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,800
- Look. - Look at them!

416
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,440
(Naive but brazen)

417
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,100
- They're so pretty! - Unbelievable.

418
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,240
(Naive but brazen)

419
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,200
Their faces are tiny.

420
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,240
(Our love is like playing with fire)

421
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
- Their faces... - This is incredible.

422
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,840
(They're lighting fires in these men's hearts.)

423
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,370
I can't take this anymore.

424
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,170
(We'll join you for the latter part of your tour.)

425
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,370
- That was great. - Well done.

426
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,240
(We love you so much.)

427
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,340
It's great to see you.

428
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,670
I'm a fan.

429
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,340
- Hello. - Hello.

430
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,800
They look so pretty.

431
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,300
They're amazing.

432
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,970
They look like celebrities.

433
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,140
More so than we do.

434
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,440
- Unbelievable. - Their faces...

435
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,770
They look like celebrities.

436
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,370
Instead of saying they're pretty...

437
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,000
Haha said they look chic.

438
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,910
- Their faces... - They look different.

439
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,140
Please welcome Blackpink!

440
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,970
(The Blackpink fairies will help them forget their misfortunes.)

441
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,940
- That was amazing. - That was great.

442
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,440
- This is crazy. - Okay, then.

443
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,940
Blackpink already split into Team Black and Team Pink.

444
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,000
- Really? - Already?

445
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,070
- Who's on Team Black? - Me.

446
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,410
- Okay. - Lisa and Ji Soo.

447
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,840
Jennie, you're with me.

448
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,270
Jennie, perfect. We got you and Rose.

449
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,070
- Hello. - This is perfect.

450
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,240
Well done.

451
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,370
Part two of the tour is a "Good out of Evil" mission...

452
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,440
where each team gets one more chance to win prizes.

453
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,000
- Great. - Everyone?

454
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,170
That sounds great.

455
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:01,000
After each game, both teams place a bet to win more R coins.

456
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,300
You can win from 2 times to 10 times more R coins.

457
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,970
- Let's go to Europe. - Let's do this.

458
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,540
- We can go. - It's possible.

459
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,870
If we win...

460
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,500
(He said Europe.)

461
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,440
Lisa, do you like Europe?

462
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,800
- Yes. - Do you?

463
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,410
Her reaction's so cute as well.

464
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,200
The winning team can bet twice...

465
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,740
and the losing team can bet once.

466
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,640
Each member of Blackpink will pick a lucky bag.

467
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,500
A bag contains 40R, 2 bags contain 20R and the other has nothing.

468
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,140
Oh no.

469
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,570
- It's okay. - Don't worry.

470
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,970
(They're new to this kind of game.)

471
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,240
I have a question.

472
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,800
- Are any of you really unlucky? - She is.

473
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,340
- She is. - Really?

474
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,300
- Is Lisa unlucky? - Why?

475
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,870
- You're on the right team. - Too bad.

476
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,940
- We're very experienced. - Join the club.

477
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,040
(Meet the rest.)

478
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,240
- Nice to meet you. - Say hello to your friend.

479
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,000
- We're all very unlucky. - You're on the right team.

480
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,040
Come forward and pick a lucky bag.

481
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,470
- Pick one. - Any of them will do.

482
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,740
Any bag will do.

483
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,270
It doesn't really matter.

484
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,040
- What if I picked the wrong one? - Is that the one in front of you?

485
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,470
- There's something inside. - Let's have a look.

486
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,540
- We'll start with Jennie. - Jennie.

487
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,570
On 1, 2, 3.

488
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,370
- How much? - 20R.

489
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,570
Well done.

490
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,470
- Next up is Rose. - Rose.

491
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,500
- Please, please, please. - Zero!

492
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,800
(Rose won 30R)

493
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,340
She won 30R!

494
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,370
That was incredible!

495
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,240
That was great.

496
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,440
Well done. Well done.

497
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,700
(They feel it. They feel the force of misfortune.)

498
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,340
20R and 0R.

499
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,870
Our team...

500
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,440
I'm not even surprised anymore.

501
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,200
- Team Pink starts off with 50R. - Okay.

502
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,940
Team Black starts off with 20R.

503
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,800
(Prizes: Plane ticket, laptop, tteokgalbi,)

504
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,770
(crude liquor, seasoned laver, paper fan)

505
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,770
(Jeonju Magistrate's office is 130 years old and equal to City Hall.)

506
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,440
Hello.

507
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,840
Sit over here, Ji Soo. And Lisa.

508
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,140
You can sit over there.

509
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,640
(It's like a bed of flowers.)

510
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,870
That will do.

511
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,670
We don't need these.

512
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,270
(He kicks out the unwelcome guests.)

513
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,870
What are you doing? What was that about?

514
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,570
- I'm filming with Blackpink. - Are you?

515
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,740
There are so many cameras.

516
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,670
Have you never been on a show with this many cameras before?

517
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,440
- There are so many. - Are there?

518
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,100
Rose, can you do the slate for us?

519
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,800
Rose, can you do the slate?

520
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,500
Say, "This is the slate. 1, 2, 3."

521
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,870
This is the slate. 1, 2, 3.

522
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,100
(Blackpink's first slate)

523
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,670
That was perfect.

524
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,370
Can you close the door?

525
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,470
(There's no more room.)

526
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,170
- Let's go to Europe. - Why did you close the door?

527
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,240
Not everyone's here yet.

528
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,140
You don't even have a cushion.

529
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,940
Where is it?

530
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,740
What's wrong with you?

531
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,200
What's his problem?

532
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,670
I don't have a problem.

533
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,800
You need to hurry up. Don't make the stars wait.

534
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,570
- Blackpink's really busy. - Why is the door closed?

535
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,140
(Everyone's present at last. What will the first game be?)

536
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:16,370
The first game is "5 Seconds Q and A".

537
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,800
- "5 Seconds Q and A". - What's that?

538
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,370
(Q and A session involving luck?)

539
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:28,270
A member from each team will sit facing each other wearing a helmet.

540
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,870
They will take turns asking each other a question.

541
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:35,570
You have to give 3 answers within 5 seconds to pass.

542
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,440
If you fail to ask a valid question or answer...

543
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,140
Remove 1 of the 3 sticks from the loser's helmet.

544
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,700
One of the three sticks will make water pour...

545
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,940
from the bottle.

546
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,340
(There is a 1 out of 3 chance of getting wet.)

547
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,000
I better not get picked.

548
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,170
(There is a 1 out of 3 chance of getting wet.)

549
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,970
- Gosh. - That's cute.

550
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,200
- What's that? - Goodness.

551
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,240
(Do you want us to wear this?)

552
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,100
We'll all get wet.

553
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,370
- Goodness. - The amount of water...

554
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,940
- There's too much water. - This is just...

555
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,100
- Only 1 out of 3 will spill water. - Yes.

556
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,770
Water will pour out as soon as we remove a stick.

557
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,670
- Our team... - Jae Seok is in that team.

558
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,670
- Seriously. - Our team's full of unlucky people.

559
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,440
- What am I going to do? - We're already lost.

560
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,300
- What should we do? - Lisa's at a disadvantage.

561
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,700
What about you two? Are you lucky?

562
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,170
- Are you lucky? - I am.

563
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,700
- Really? - She's really lucky.

564
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,870
- She's the lucky one. - I see.

565
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,870
Whenever she plays a game, she wins every time.

566
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,440
- Really? - If she wants something,

567
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,040
even when she's losing, she'll win in the end.

568
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,370
- Really? - She's amazing.

569
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,440
- Let's start the game. - Okay.

570
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,600
The team who wins three times first will be the winner.

571
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,700
- Three wins. - I see.

572
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,500
- You have to ask good questions. - It's not that hard.

573
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,500
You have to do well.

574
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,370
First player from each team, please come up.

575
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,140
(Who will be the first player from the unlucky team?)

576
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,040
Kwang Soo will go first.

577
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,970
- Why me first? - All right.

578
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,200
Kwang Soo, come on.

579
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,370
- What about your team? - It's Jong Kook.

580
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,270
- Who? - Me?

581
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,000
- Me? - Of course.

582
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,640
Go and crush him.

583
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,640
(Kwang Soo versus Jong Kook)

584
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,640
(Shut Jong Kook's mouth with difficult questions.)

585
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,800
I will do it.

586
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,340
- From the start? - Of course.

587
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,100
Crush him.

588
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,840
Three female celebrities you really want to date.

589
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,270
(Gosh.)

590
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,440
Song Hye Gyo, Kim Tae Hee... Gianna Jun.

591
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,540
(Time's over.)

592
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,000
(Kwang Soo gets a chance to remove a stick.)

593
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Why can't I think of their names?

594
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,040
- Go right ahead. - Why couldn't I...

595
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,970
Why couldn't I think of any actresses' names?

596
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,300
Go right ahead.

597
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,440
(Kwang Soo fails.)

598
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,700
You should've picked the middle one.

599
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,540
He's right.

600
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,440
Name three four-character idioms you like.

601
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,200
Go-jin-gam-rae, jin-tae-yang-nan, and gyeol-cho-bo-eun!

602
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,200
(Kwang Soo is so smart.)

603
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,100
He's really focused today.

604
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,570
Name three female celebrities you dated.

605
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,070
(Gosh)

606
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,500
Name three female celebrities you dated.

607
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,540
- One... - Gosh.

608
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,100
(How can you ask that question in public?)

609
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,840
- What? - Okay.

610
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,940
- Stop. - Oh, no.

611
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,840
- That was scary. - Are you mad?

612
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,840
- Goodness. - Are you crazy?

613
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,170
What? You could've named just anyone.

614
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,440
You can name anyone.

615
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,870
- Just anyone. - Can I?

616
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,940
- Yes, name anyone. - That's right.

617
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,200
- Pull it out. - Okay.

618
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,640
(If he doesn't succeed, he'll get asked another question.)

619
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,400
(He has a 50-50 chance. What's it going to be?)

620
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,970
(Kwang Soo fails again.)

621
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,000
- You're really unlucky. - What?

622
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,100
Seriously, you're unlucky.

623
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,770
It's getting really interesting. This is great.

624
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,470
(His eyes are burning with anger.)

625
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,200
- Wait. Don't look at me like that. - Okay.

626
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,670
- Be nice. - Okay.

627
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:43,940
(I'll finish you off with this one question.)

628
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,900
(With what question will Jong Kook attack?)

629
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,600
Name three actresses you worked with and dated.

630
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,770
(Name three actresses you worked with and dated.)

631
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:58,470
(Breaking news! Kwang Soo reveals his dating history!)

632
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,240
Kwang Soo.

633
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,570
(I wanted to keep it to my grave.)

634
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,240
It's okay. Those were just names. You just said some names.

635
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,640
Kwang Soo. You simply talked.

636
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:09,870
Kwang Soo. You just made them up.

637
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,600
- It was harmless. - I'm not sweating.

638
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,100
- What? - It meant nothing.

639
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,570
- What's wrong? - You just said some names.

640
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,940
- You just said some names. - You're good at this game.

641
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,900
- Kwang Soo, do it. - Go.

642
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,200
- Use your anger. - Do it.

643
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,040
Name three reasons why you like Yoon Eun Hye.

644
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,340
- She's pretty. She's rich. - One, two...

645
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,200
(Jong Kook is knocked out.)

646
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,140
- Get up! - You did it!

647
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,740
- You did it. - Why did you lose?

648
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,000
- Get up. - Pretty and rich.

649
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,370
- Goodness. - Because she's sexy.

650
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,600
- Because she's sexy. - You're so materialistic.

651
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,040
- Kwang Soo, pull it. - This is crazy.

652
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,540
(There's only one stick left.)

653
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,100
- It's pouring down. - Yes!

654
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,470
(Jong Kook's face gets showered with cold water.)

655
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,400
Lee Kwang Soo wins!

656
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,540
(Team Black is leading with 1 point.)

657
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,840
This game is hard.

658
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,200
We're good.

659
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,500
Hey, guys.

660
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,570
- Great! - Nice!

661
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,740
Next up is Ji Soo!

662
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,740
Oh, no.

663
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,540
Ji Soo! Ji Soo!

664
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,340
Okay.

665
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,200
(Ji Soo versus Rose)

666
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,170
- This... - Wait, Ji Soo. I'll do it for you.

667
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,070
- This... - Wait.

668
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,170
(He's showing off his manners.)

669
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,840
All three of us are trying to help her.

670
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,700
- Kwang Soo. - Her face is so small.

671
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,870
This much strap is left because her head is so small!

672
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,170
- Kwang Soo had no space. - What do you mean?

673
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,640
- Don't move your head too much. - Be careful.

674
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,340
Pull your hair back so your face shows.

675
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,200
(The men are trying to get her attention.)

676
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,600
Do you want to pull your hair back and wear the helmet again?

677
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,770
Okay.

678
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,800
- You're so nice. - I'm just helping...

679
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,270
because it's dangerous.

680
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,500
- Okay. - Now,

681
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,500
- let's win again. - Ji Soo and Rose. Start!

682
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,540
Name three countries you want to visit.

683
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,400
Australia, Thailand, and Japan.

684
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,740
- Hey, Rose. Don't be too nice. - He's right.

685
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,840
- That's not how you do it. - Get it together!

686
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,800
- Come on. - I'm sorry!

687
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,270
All right.

688
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,070
What took you so long in the bathroom yesterday?

689
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:10,270
I pooped, brushed my teeth, and washed my face.

690
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,670
- Good job. - Great work.

691
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,140
- Good job. - Nice.

692
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,770
- That was good. - Great.

693
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,840
Rose, go.

694
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,840
Name three celebrities you like from YG.

695
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,740
G-Dragon, Tae Yang, and Seung Ri.

696
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,870
G-Dragon, Tae Yang, and Seung Ri.

697
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,900
- Nice. - Not Dae Sung.

698
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,270
- Poor Dae Sung. - Sorry, Dae Sung.

699
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,600
- Not Dae Sung. - Dae Sung, she didn't pick you.

700
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,100
Poor Dae Sung. He wasn't picked.

701
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,100
Say three complaints you have for our boss.

702
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,400
- Okay! - "Why don't you love me a lot?"

703
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,940
I don't know.

704
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,100
(Time's over.)

705
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,600
- Nice! - Did you hear that?

706
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,100
(A labor and management question worked.)

707
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,300
- This is it. - Great.

708
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,940
- It's okay. - Fine.

709
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,840
- The water started spilling. - Let's get it at once.

710
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,400
You got the heart of your boss.

711
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,740
(I'm saved.)

712
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,340
- No. - Not yet.

713
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,370
(That's too bad.)

714
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,640
- Okay. - Okay.

715
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,170
Name three male idols from YG you don't want to be friends with.

716
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:09,570
G-Dragon, Dae Sung, and Seung Ri.

717
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,500
- No! - Wait a minute.

718
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,270
Tae Yang and Dae Sung got switched.

719
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,570
- Dae Sung, don't be upset. - No. Wait.

720
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,370
She said Dae Sung instead of Tae Yang this time.

721
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,170
Dae Sung, please don't be mad.

722
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,540
Dae Sung, you're the best.

723
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,300
- Ji Soo, you need to win. - She's witty.

724
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,900
- Ji Soo, let's go! - Crush her!

725
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,240
Why do you fight with Lisa so often?

726
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,740
Because she ignores me, pretends to be cool,

727
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,770
and says mean things.

728
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,340
Because she ignores me...

729
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,740
(Lisa's getting attacked over here.)

730
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,000
Okay. Good job!

731
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,900
I think she's too honest.

732
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,540
- Do they really fight a lot? - No, they don't.

733
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,440
We're friends. That's why we bicker.

734
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,970
Name three male celebrities you want to date.

735
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,670
(Who is the man that stole Ji Soo's heart?)

736
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,340
Haha, Kim Jong Kook, and Lee Kwang Soo.

737
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,840
Hey, I'm taken.

738
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,340
Not me.

739
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,140
- I'm sorry. - No.

740
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,440
- No! - I'm sorry.

741
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,200
(Kwang Soo is touched.)

742
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,700
- Ji Soo, that was good. - Kwang Soo's happy.

743
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,640
Tell me three proverbs you like.

744
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,740
(Tell me three proverbs you like.)

745
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,140
"It's a piece of cake."

746
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,570
(It's a piece of cake.)

747
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,270
(Time's over.)

748
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,600
(With the proverb question, Ji Soo gets to remove a stick.)

749
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
- Yes! - Good job!

750
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,300
- You did it! - Nice!

751
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,840
Remove the middle one.

752
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,040
Yes, get the one in the middle.

753
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,100
(There's a 50-50 chance. Will it spill water or not?)

754
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,000
- There it goes. - Water's spilling.

755
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,440
- It's spilling. - There it goes.

756
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,940
- There. - Gosh.

757
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,940
- It's spilling. - There it goes.

758
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,240
- It's cold. - Team Black wins.

759
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,670
(Team Black wins with 2 points.)

760
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,670
- Ji Soo, great job! - You're the best!

761
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,200
- You did really great. - Jennie, avenge her.

762
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,340
Lisa, come out.

763
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,440
(Lisa versus Jennie)

764
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,740
- It's over if Lisa wins. - That's right.

765
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,370
(I'll finish you off with one question.)

766
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,670
- It's over if Lisa wins. - That's right.

767
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,300
(I guess you don't know me well.)

768
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,870
She wins every time.

769
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,040
(Testimony: She wins whenever she plays a game.)

770
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,340
(She never loses. Jennie is the Queen of Victory.)

771
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:17,300
(Up against Jennie is Lisa, the unlucky member of Blackpink.)

772
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,600
(The unlucky versus the lucky. Will there be a surprising result?)

773
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,200
Name three complaints you have about Blackpink.

774
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,400
(Name three complaints you have about Blackpink.)

775
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,000
(Jennie knocks Lisa over with one question!)

776
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,170
- You should say it. - Say it.

777
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,200
She's just too nice.

778
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
- That's why. - Lisa, you're too nice.

779
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,340
Lisa, this is it.

780
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,800
(Will she pull out the right stick at once like she says?)

781
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,870
(It's a one shot, one kill.)

782
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,970
(She's the lucky girl!)

783
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,570
She's the Queen of Games.

784
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,070
(She was born to play games.)

785
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,540
She's the Queen of Games. She's really good.

786
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,670
(Team Pink wins a point.)

787
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,100
- Seok Jin will play this time. - Okay!

788
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,700
(It's Seok Jin from Team Black.)

789
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,740
I think Seok Jin's going to be attacked.

790
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,840
(Seok Jin versus Haha)

791
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,800
- Let's go. Nice to meet you. - All right.

792
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,340
- Nice to meet you. - It's only a game.

793
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,470
Ready, set, go.

794
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,340
Three things that make you regret getting married.

795
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,540
It's frustrating and... Gosh, I'm about to lose it.

796
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,770
(It came from the bottom of his heart.)

797
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,540
What am I going to do?

798
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,170
How could you...

799
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:33,240
You can't ask a question like that from the start.

800
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,170
- Hey. - Hey, you.

801
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,640
- Hey. - Oh, gosh.

802
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,700
- How could you? - I'm sorry.

803
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,770
Come on.

804
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,470
- My goodness. - I can just pull one out, right?

805
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,070
(Will he succeed at his first try?)

806
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,940
- It wasn't the one, right? - The water isn't dripping.

807
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,940
- The water isn't dripping. - I passed, right?

808
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,340
(Haha fails to pull out the right one.)

809
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,070
- Let's go. - That was good.

810
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:55,670
Tell me three female celebrities you want to meet right now.

811
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,670
(Tell me three female celebrities you want to meet right now.)

812
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,800
Shin Ji...

813
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:02,340
(Shin Ji from Koyote?)

814
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,570
Shin Ji, Gianna Jun, and...

815
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,570
(He runs out of time.)

816
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,040
I couldn't think for a moment.

817
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,670
What's wrong? You could've just named anyone.

818
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,000
I don't know. I couldn't think of any names.

819
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,500
Why did this throw you off?

820
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,240
Why did I name Shin Ji out of the blue?

821
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,070
How are you doing, Shin Ji?

822
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,070
(He summons Shin Ji.)

823
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,740
- Which one do you think it is? - Let's get it right.

824
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,170
- Let's get it right. - Let this one be the last.

825
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,370
- I think it could be this one. - This one?

826
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:27,040
- You can't possibly know. - We picked the left before.

827
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,840
- Let's go with the right one. - Okay.

828
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,540
- Please. - Please be the right one.

829
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,740
(The level of water doesn't change.)

830
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,700
- That wasn't it. - He never listens.

831
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,770
Everyone could've known that wasn't the right one.

832
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,240
Let's go.

833
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,600
- Tell me... - Tell you...

834
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,770
three mathematical formulas you like.

835
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,370
Pythagoras' theorem,

836
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,970
apple formula, and lunch formula.

837
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,570
(Where did the lunch formula come from?)

838
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,940
- What formula? Lunch formula? - Lunch formula.

839
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,100
- Lunch? - Yes, lunch.

840
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,140
What is lunch formula?

841
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:05,370
I hope we get through this one more time.

842
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,370
(Should I let the water splash on him?)

843
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,540
Please.

844
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,170
(There's a 50-50 chance. Will he succeed?)

845
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,600
I don't think it's the right one.

846
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,600
- You need to lower your head. - Lower your head.

847
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,100
- I don't think it's the right one. - Lower your head.

848
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,570
(I hope he won't be unlucky this time.)

849
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,170
(No way.)

850
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:23,970
(It seems like Seok Jin's reputation won't be changed.)

851
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,040
(The score is 2 to 2.)

852
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,100
I can't believe it.

853
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,270
(Is it my turn now?)

854
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,400
Now, it's the final.

855
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,200
- Okay, Ji Hyo. - It's Ji Hyo's turn.

856
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,470
We meet at the final.

857
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,070
(Which team will win the game?)

858
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,570
(Last Round is Jae Seok versus Ji Hyo.)

859
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,140
I hope we win.

860
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,570
(I'm going to start.)

861
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,370
- I'll start now. - Okay.

862
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,870
- I hear that you have a boyfriend. - Okay.

863
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,340
Tell me three reasons why you like your boyfriend.

864
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,800
He's sexy, rich, and handsome.

865
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,370
(How can she be so composed?)

866
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,700
(Although she doesn't have a boyfriend, she handled it well.)

867
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,270
Well done. That was great.

868
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,340
- Okay. - Tell me...

869
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,500
three adult films you saw recently.

870
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,570
"Madame Ae Ma 1", "Madame Ae Ma 2", and "Madame Ae Ma 3".

871
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,840
(He watched the Madame Ae Ma trilogy.)

872
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,340
(Jae Seok recommends watching the complete series.)

873
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,170
- Good job. - How did he do that?

874
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,270
- You re-watched the classics. - I sure did.

875
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,370
You watched them all. Did you watch them on tapes?

876
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,400
- When did you see them? - "Madame Ae Ma"?

877
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,770
- I watched all three of them. - Are you sweating?

878
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,670
- Are you sweating, Jae Seok? - I am not sweating.

879
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,600
- This is just water. - Don't picture the films.

880
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,400
- Stop thinking dirty thoughts. - Kwang Soo,

881
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,440
this isn't sweat.

882
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,370
He tends to watch the classics again.

883
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,840
He loves the classics.

884
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,440
Tell me three proverbs you like.

885
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,540
"Mend the barn after the cow is stolen."

886
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,840
"Fishermen..." What was that?

887
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,870
(I didn't see that coming.)

888
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,140
You were thinking of four character idioms, not a proverb.

889
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,370
What you said was an idiom.

890
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,310
But why do I feel like I'm being punished?

891
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,870
(The helmet seems to be defected.)

892
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:47,940
Something's wrong with this helmet.

893
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,600
Our helmet is weird.

894
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,870
- As I said before... - Get it right at once.

895
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,870
- We never picked one from there. - If we get it, the game's over.

896
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,310
We never picked one from this side, Jae Seok.

897
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,370
If we pull out the right one, the game is over. It'll be our victory.

898
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,100
We never tried one from that side.

899
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:00,810
Let's do this!

900
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,340
(He pulls it out.)

901
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,970
(If the water drips, then Team Black wins.)

902
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,870
(Jae Seok fails to pull out the correct one.)

903
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,170
(My goodness.)

904
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,500
Seriously, she's so lucky.

905
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,100
(She survives.)

906
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,500
How is that possible?

907
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,770
Can we change the helmet? It's running out of water.

908
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:19,770
- Is that so? - Yes.

909
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,940
(Water's running out even though he didn't get the punishment.)

910
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,340
(The helmet is as unlucky as its owner.)

911
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,870
- Okay. - All right.

912
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,200
Are you doing this on purpose?

913
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,770
(Why do I feel like I'm being played?)

914
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,970
I'm being punished right now.

915
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,970
The water keeps dripping.

916
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,600
Why is it dripping?

917
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,740
(You might think he's sweating.)

918
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,200
- I mean... - Hang in there, Jae Seok.

919
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,070
Come on, Ji Hyo. Hurry.

920
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,400
Isn't he sweating way too much?

921
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,470
- Just do it. - Here it goes.

922
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,940
(What is Ji Hyo's counterattack?)

923
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,370
Three reasons you like "Infinite Challenge" over Running Man.

924
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:54,240
(Three reasons he likes "Infinite Challenge" more than Running Man)

925
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,470
(We are watching you.)

926
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,200
I've been on the show for a long time.

927
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,740
(What is this?)

928
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,070
(Don't speak.)

929
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,670
(Loyalty is more important than victory.)

930
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,900
- Hey. I was trying to... - What are you doing?

931
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,870
I could've just said anything.

932
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,500
(Team Pink gets a chance to remove a stick.)

933
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,570
Here we go.

934
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,200
Which one should I pull? Jennie, what do you think?

935
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,170
If we lose now, it's so unfair.

936
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,600
- I'm not sure. - This one?

937
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,600
- The one in the middle. - We are so lucky.

938
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,670
- The center one? - That one? Let's go with that.

939
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,940
It might not be the right one.

940
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,670
- I hope so. - Ji Hyo...

941
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:33,170
(What is Ji Hyo's choice?)

942
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,470
- We survived. - We're safe.

943
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,200
(Awesome! We survived.)

944
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:39,200
That was good.

945
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,200
(I can't believe we lost our chance.)

946
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,970
- No way. - That's okay.

947
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,940
- Wait. - I think that was the right one.

948
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,870
(Water's dripping all over his face.)

949
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,170
(Is the helmet defected or did Ji Hyo succeed?)

950
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,670
- The helmet is defected. - No, we got the correct one.

951
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,770
- It's just the helmet. - Water isn't dripping.

952
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,200
- The helmet is defected. - Hang in there.

953
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,640
- It's been like this. - No, we pulled the right one.

954
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,340
(Ji Hyo succeeded.)

955
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,570
- We won. - It was right.

956
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:02,100
- Come this way. - Come here.

957
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,570
Good for us!

958
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:06,670
- The helmet was like this before. - Yes, it was.

959
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:09,100
(After careful examination, the helmet isn't defected.)

960
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,370
- There's no more water. - Take it off.

961
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,640
I knew it.

962
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,140
It's the helmet's fault.

963
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,870
Kwang Soo, this is so unfair.

964
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,670
- Well done. - Good job.

965
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,570
Great work, everyone.

966
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,140
(The final score is 2 to 3 and Team Pink wins.)

967
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,270
This means...

968
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:27,500
Team Pink wins "5 Seconds Q and A".

969
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,570
(The victory goes to Team Pink.)

970
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,100
(They obtained an advantage for the final match.)

971
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,600
We'll go outside and start betting.

972
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:35,100
We've prepared a special way of betting.

973
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,000
Team Pink will have two opportunities to bet.

974
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,400
Team Black will have only one opportunity.

975
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,370
(Team Pink gets two chances since they just won.)

976
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:47,100
With this game, you can improve the quality of the prize.

977
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,470
It's "Bet on the Shoes".

978
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,670
("Bet on the Shoes")

979
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,670
- Bet on the shoes - Bet on the shoes

980
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,370
We have a massive black and pink checkerboard in the front.

981
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,040
You are to kick the shoe three times.

982
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,370
You can predict where the shoes will fall in.

983
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,500
Then you can bet your R coins.

984
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,070
(They will bet on the place the shoes will fall in.)

985
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,270
There are three probabilities.

986
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:14,340
Out of 3 tries, if 2 of the shoes go into the pink box...

987
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,670
and one of them goes into the black box,

988
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,200
whoever bets on pink will win.

989
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,940
If you bet on pink, you'll get twice the coins you bet.

990
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,870
If you bet on all pink or all black,

991
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,740
you'll get three times as many as the coins you bet.

992
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,870
(As long as all three shoes fall into the black boxes)

993
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:27,600
(If one shoe falls into R box, the reward will be quintupled.)

994
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,270
(If two shoes fall into R boxes, it will be multiplied by ten times.)

995
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,440
(Two R boxes will get me ten times as many as the coins I bet?)

996
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,570
Team Pink will be able to bet on two probabilities.

997
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:37,470
Team Black will bet on only one probability...

998
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,500
since your team lost.

999
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,670
You will throw behind the white line.

1000
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:43,670
You will throw three times.

1001
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,670
(What will their fates be?)

1002
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:47,070
- Let's line up by teams. - Let's go.

1003
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,270
How many coins do we have?

1004
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,140
- We have 20. - We have 20R coins.

1005
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,840
R box will multiply the bet by five.

1006
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,170
(Since it's difficult to land it in R boxes, the reward is bigger.)

1007
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,040
Only rich people can bet on it.

1008
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,600
- That's right. - Goodness.

1009
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,670
How about aiming for the R box?

1010
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,400
- We shouldn't be too risky. - Right.

1011
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,570
- It's only our first betting. - Let's be safe.

1012
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,600
- Right, we should be safe. - The first one should be.

1013
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,000
Where are you going to put yours?

1014
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,240
- We'll split the two. - Come on.

1015
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,100
What is that? You're playing safe.

1016
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,670
What's the point of betting?

1017
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,670
Right, it's pointless then.

1018
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,600
Betting is relative.

1019
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,200
This is a good strategy when we're playing against them.

1020
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,100
We need to secure more coins and we'll bet more later.

1021
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:29,140
You guys are so petty.

1022
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,100
- You're so petty. - Yes, you are.

1023
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,670
You're pettier.

1024
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,340
How can you be so petty?

1025
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,570
(They're acting immature.)

1026
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,400
What do you want to do? It's up to you, Ji Soo.

1027
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,340
- Do as you please. - No, you should do it.

1028
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,770
We're all bad at it, Ji Soo.

1029
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,470
- We should choose one of the two. - Right.

1030
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,670
That's a safe bet.

1031
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,940
- We'll go with black. - We are betting 10R coins.

1032
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,770
(Team Black bets 10R coins on black.)

1033
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,000
Team Pink will throw first.

1034
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,370
- Let's go. - Rose will go first.

1035
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,570
Don't be nervous. Just don't let it land into R box.

1036
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,970
- Relax. - Anything but R box?

1037
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,970
(It can fall into anywhere but not R box?)

1038
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,570
- Rose. - Rose.

1039
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,970
- Let it fall in a black box. - Get ready.

1040
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,770
- You can start. - Good luck.

1041
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,770
You can do it.

1042
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,400
(The first shoe...)

1043
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,070
(is flying.)

1044
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,670
- Is it black? - That's it.

1045
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,340
(It lands in a black box.)

1046
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,240
That was great.

1047
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,740
(The probability is getting higher for black.)

1048
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,570
(Pink boxes will help only our team.)

1049
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:21,370
- That's okay. - I'm sorry.

1050
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,740
If another one goes into the black one, then that's it.

1051
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,200
(If the shoe falls into a black box, it's over.)

1052
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,470
- Please. - Fall into a black box.

1053
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,770
- If only it lands in a black box... - Let it be black.

1054
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,640
- Please let it be black. - You can do it, Jae Seok.

1055
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,440
- This can be the last throw. - That's right.

1056
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,200
Jae Seok, good luck.

1057
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,400
(Jae Seok is the second one to pitch his shoe.)

1058
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,670
(Where will his shoe fall?)

1059
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:42,540
I have a feeling he'll make it.

1060
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,670
No, he won't.

1061
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:46,270
(It falls in a pink box.)

1062
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:50,140
(How can I let it fall into a pink box?)

1063
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,370
(He again shows he's not a good kicker.)

1064
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,770
We're going to win.

1065
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,500
Goodness.

1066
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,970
(Even his foot isn't lucky.)

1067
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,370
He just went without saying anything.

1068
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:59,070
All we have to do is put it in a pink box.

1069
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,270
(No one can predict the score at this point.)

1070
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:03,040
- I think you can kick gently. - Gently?

1071
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,500
Relax. Don't be nervous.

1072
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,940
(In order to win, the shoe must go into a pink box.)

1073
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,810
- Jennie. - Kick it to the black box.

1074
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,240
(The fate of both teams depends on her shoe.)

1075
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,840
- Don't think about it. - Please go into a pink box.

1076
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,470
(Will it go into a pink box?)

1077
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,870
(Or will it go into a black box?)

1078
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,310
- Please go into a pink box. - You got it.

1079
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,840
- Please, go into a pink box. - You got it.

1080
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,070
(Where will it land?)

1081
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:30,970
(After the shoe rolls around, the shoe falls into...)

1082
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:31,970
- Please. - We got it.

1083
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,040
(The shoe falls into...)

1084
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,670
(a pink box.)

1085
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:37,140
(Two shoes go into pink boxes and one shoe goes into a black box.)

1086
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,170
(Pink Team wins the bet.)

1087
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,400
(They're disappointed.)

1088
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,100
(Thanks to Jennie, Pink Team wins a chance.)

1089
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,200
(Crying)

1090
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,140
Ji Soo lost her mind for a moment.

1091
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,840
(She doesn't care anymore.)

1092
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,000
I'm sorry.

1093
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,640
(We won 20R.)

1094
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:01,640
(Black Team wins 10R and Pink Team wins 50R.)

1095
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,570
(It's time to eat a meal that's special to Jeonju.)

1096
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:05,700
It looks delicious.

1097
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,600
(Are there only dried laver and soy sauce?)

1098
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,340
- Is this all? - These are Jennie's favorite.

1099
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,670
- Really? - I love rice and dried laver.

1100
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,140
I love dried laver very much.

1101
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,240
- I don't need other side dishes. - Really?

1102
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,270
In this game, you get to taste local dishes in Jeonju.

1103
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,070
It's called "Jeonju Meal 31".

1104
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,640
("Jeonju Meal 31")

1105
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,540
- It's "Jeonju Meal 31". - 31.

1106
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,070
For each round, you can win one side dish.

1107
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:32,600
It's provided to the winning team.

1108
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,200
The game rules are simple.

1109
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,370
You lose if you call out a specific number.

1110
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:43,540
Each team will give me an even number from 10 to 31.

1111
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:47,810
You can't call out the addition of the 2 numbers divided by 2.

1112
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,140
It doesn't require math skills.

1113
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,140
- No one knows beforehand. - It's completely random.

1114
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,940
Our team is at a disadvantage.

1115
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:54,940
- Why? - Why?

1116
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,270
Let's not play games based on luck.

1117
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,970
We've never been lucky.

1118
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,670
You're also bad at games that require strength.

1119
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,310
We aren't physically strong.

1120
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,140
- Games based on luck may be better. - You may be right.

1121
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,140
A member from each team will take turns to call out a number.

1122
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,670
Every time you call out a number, you'll pour hot sauce.

1123
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,340
Does someone have to eat it later?

1124
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,840
The player who loses...

1125
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,040
(You eat the hot sauce if you lose.)

1126
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,100
Hey!

1127
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,700
Isn't that too cruel?

1128
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,940
Oh, no.

1129
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:22,970
The player who loses must take a bite of the food with hot sauce.

1130
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,900
The winning team will receive a side dish.

1131
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,070
- Okay. - All right.

1132
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,770
(The winning team gets a side dish and earns 40R.)

1133
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,700
What's the first side dish?

1134
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:32,900
- I have to eat that. - It's tteokgalbi.

1135
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,240
(They're desperate to eat it.)

1136
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,500
It looks so good.

1137
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,570
(Jeonju tteokgalbi arrives.)

1138
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:42,970
(The prize for the first round is Jeonju's special tteokgalbi.)

1139
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:44,900
Please give me a number each.

1140
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:48,040
- You're up, Kwang Soo. - The first round will be easy.

1141
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,900
- Tteokgalbi smells amazing. - It's great.

1142
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,700
- Gosh. - Steam is rising from it.

1143
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,170
A member from each team should sit in the front.

1144
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,170
- Ji Soo will go. - Okay.

1145
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,470
(He gets embarrassed.)

1146
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:04,570
I thought he said my name.

1147
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:08,440
(Ji Soo from Team Black plays against Jennie from Team Pink.)

1148
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,700
- It's a fight between two women. - Do you know how to play it?

1149
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:12,970
- Do we call out three numbers? - Yes.

1150
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:15,700
You can call out up to three numbers.

1151
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,800
You already know the rules.

1152
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,670
(Why are you asking when you know?)

1153
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:22,170
- "You already know." - She's starting her attack.

1154
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:23,600
(Jennie suddenly attacks her.)

1155
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,840
Of course.

1156
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,800
(It's a war of hot sauce between two ladies.)

1157
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,370
Play rock-paper-scissors to determine who goes first.

1158
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,270
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Nice.

1159
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:33,870
- Ji Soo will start the game. - Ji Soo, do not lose.

1160
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,000
You'll eat the hot sauce.

1161
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,240
Start pouring, Ji Soo.

1162
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,440
(The game starts.)

1163
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:42,470
One, two, three.

1164
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,470
Four, five, six.

1165
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:46,940
(They pour a lot.)

1166
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:49,100
- It's okay to pour until 10. - Seven, eight, nine.

1167
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,070
That's a lot.

1168
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:54,100
10, 11.

1169
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,670
- They've come far. - It's okay.

1170
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:58,470
- Ji Soo, be careful. - I said 11.

1171
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:01,900
- 12, 13. - Gosh, be careful.

1172
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,170
- I can smell the sauce from here. - Do it slowly.

1173
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,840
There's a lot in the bowl.

1174
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,970
14.

1175
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,740
You're doing well.

1176
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,870
(Whoever loses will numb her taste buds.)

1177
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,500
15.

1178
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,900
(She's hesitant.)

1179
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:19,970
Wait, isn't it okay until 20?

1180
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,240
16.

1181
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:22,840
17.

1182
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,940
(She hesitates for a moment.)

1183
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,140
It's okay.

1184
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,940
- This is driving me crazy. - I can't do it anymore.

1185
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,540
You're in trouble now.

1186
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,470
18, 19.

1187
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,170
(Jennie said two numbers. Did she say the losing number?)

1188
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,070
- She said two numbers. - She's doomed.

1189
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,100
- I think the next is the one. - This is great.

1190
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,870
- 20. - 20?

1191
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:47,240
(If Team Pink also gave 20, the losing number is 20.)

1192
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,400
(Is 20 the losing number?)

1193
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,440
What?

1194
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,970
I think you'll lose next.

1195
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:54,070
What, 20?

1196
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:55,340
The real game starts now.

1197
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,340
21.

1198
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:02,370
(Is 21 a safe number to call out?)

1199
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:03,770
She lost.

1200
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:06,370
(They're playing a dangerous game.)

1201
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:13,240
(The losing number is 21. Team Black loses the 1st round.)

1202
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,870
(Good job, Ji Soo.)

1203
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:15,970
That was great, Ji Soo.

1204
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:17,700
Great job, Ji Soo.

1205
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,470
- I won. - You did it.

1206
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:23,700
You gave me 22 and 20.

1207
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,340
- The losing number was 21. - Good job.

1208
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,900
That's right, but we couldn't have known.

1209
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,970
Team Black may take tteokgalbi.

1210
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:34,200
- It's okay, you did well. - It's going to be delicious.

1211
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,900
- I'm sorry. - We won tteokgalbi.

1212
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,370
- He's already eating. - Can we eat now?

1213
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:41,240
Seok Jin, please eat later.

1214
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,540
- We must eat later. - Are you talking to me?

1215
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,600
- What are you doing? - When will we eat?

1216
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,400
Why are you eating the side dish first?

1217
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,800
Gosh, what are you doing?

1218
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,640
Don't put it back if you took a bite of it.

1219
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,140
(He couldn't wait to eat.)

1220
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,370
Goodness, Seok Jin.

1221
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:56,370
Excuse me, Kwang Soo.

1222
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:58,270
- Do I eat it now? - Can he eat it for her?

1223
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,900
Can someone else eat it for her?

1224
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,900
- May I eat it now? - Can he do it for her?

1225
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,970
I could eat it for her but...

1226
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,200
Come on, Kwang Soo. You can eat it for her.

1227
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,440
(Kwang Soo, please take my tortilla with hot sauce.)

1228
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,370
(He's in a daze.)

1229
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:15,970
Of course I can eat it for you but...

1230
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:22,300
(Only you can eat this tortilla for me.)

1231
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:24,340
- His eyes are quivering. - Tell her no.

1232
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,600
- No. - Don't do it.

1233
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,700
She's trying to use you.

1234
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:30,400
Look at her in the eyes.

1235
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,100
She knows that she's pretty.

1236
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,540
(She knows that she's pretty.)

1237
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,440
- You can't do that. - No.

1238
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:40,500
- You can't do it. - Listen, Jennie.

1239
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,470
You don't like Kwang Soo, do you?

1240
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,340
She might like him.

1241
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,900
I'll give you the answer if he eats it.

1242
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:50,470
- No. - She'll answer if he eats it.

1243
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,440
In 5, 4...

1244
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,940
- No, don't do it, Kwang Soo. - Don't eat it.

1245
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,940
- You shouldn't eat it for her. - No.

1246
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,200
- Kwang Soo is so cool. - No.

1247
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,570
Please eat it for me.

1248
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:03,170
(Please eat it for me, Kwang Soo.)

1249
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,540
No!

1250
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:08,040
(Will he stay loyal to his team or choose love instead?)

1251
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,000
Please, please.

1252
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,700
(Will he stay loyal to his team or choose love instead?)

1253
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,940
(His mouth is wide open.)

1254
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,770
- Okay, I'll do it. - He's going to get hurt.

1255
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:17,570
- No way. - Just take one bite.

1256
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:19,740
- Don't eat all. - Just take a bite.

1257
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,570
- Kwang Soo is amazing. - I poured so much sauce.

1258
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:23,900
- He ate the whole thing. - He's so cool.

1259
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,340
- He didn't need to eat all. - He's amazing.

1260
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:31,540
Poor Kwang Soo.

1261
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,640
What an amazing man.

1262
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,040
My goodness.

1263
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,640
Jennie, you must answer the question now.

1264
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,470
- Don't say that you hate him. - Why would she hate him?

1265
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:44,470
(It's okay, Jennie. You can tell me the truth.)

1266
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,540
(She stands up.)

1267
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:52,240
She ignores and leaves him behind.

1268
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,270
(He hasn't swallowed it yet.)

1269
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:57,340
- Just eat it. - Good job, Kwang Soo.

1270
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,370
- Good job, Kwang Soo. - You're amazing.

1271
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,440
- Won't you answer the question? - That was great.

1272
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,970
Thank you.

1273
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,600
Isn't Kwang Soo a great man?

1274
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,640
He's such a great person.

1275
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,970
She used you, Kwang Soo.

1276
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:10,000
You do things that are unnecessary.

1277
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,640
Here's the second side dish.

1278
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,440
- Is that it? - It's a kind of soup.

1279
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,100
Don't I get anything for eating the tortilla?

1280
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:21,070
- Is that it? - You ate it only for Jennie.

1281
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:22,670
It's fulvescens galbitang.

1282
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:25,240
- I've never had it before. - It's fulvescens galbitang.

1283
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,140
- It's very delicious. - It looks so good.

1284
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,040
- Fulvescens. - I love that dish.

1285
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,900
This sauce is perfect for Seok Jin because of his nose.

1286
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,470
- Tabasco? - It's Tabasco.

1287
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:36,600
The sauce is Tabasco, and Seok Jin has a big nose

1288
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,070
(It's Seok Jin's favorite sauce.)

1289
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,040
(He loves it.)

1290
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,670
He can't smell how spicy it is.

1291
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:44,570
The smell is so refreshing.

1292
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,440
- Get ready. - Play rock-paper-scissors.

1293
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,700
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1294
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,140
(The number is only shown to the viewers.)

1295
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,370
Make a bold move, Seok Jin.

1296
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,940
- One, two, three. - Gosh.

1297
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,270
(He pretends to be strong.)

1298
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,800
- What are you doing? - Either way,

1299
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,040
- it's a war. - It's a war.

1300
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,700
- Is that what's going on? - Don't do that.

1301
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,500
- Keep it edible. - Four, five,

1302
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,940
- six. - No one can eat that.

1303
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:11,470
(She pours in a lot of hot sauce.)

1304
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:14,740
(For whom are they playing the game?)

1305
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,770
- Okay. - Stop it, Ji Hyo.

1306
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:17,900
Is this how you'll play it?

1307
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:20,740
One of you has to eat that.

1308
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,340
(He flinches.)

1309
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,970
- Seok Jin got a little scared. - Seven.

1310
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,070
(I'm manly. I will go as far as I can.)

1311
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:32,900
(Goodness)

1312
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,570
- Seok Jin got a little scared. - Seven.

1313
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,400
(He puts it back.)

1314
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,140
(He quickly decides to end the competition.)

1315
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,370
I told you that he's scared.

1316
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:46,170
- When he saw Ji Hyo get aggressive, - He got scared.

1317
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,370
he was afraid that he might have to eat it.

1318
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:50,040
That's what he imagined.

1319
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,040
- Seven? - Yes, seven.

1320
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:54,100
Eight, nine, ten.

1321
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:57,440
- Eight, nine, ten. - There's no need to do that.

1322
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,270
You're the one who declared war.

1323
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,370
- 11, 12, 13. - "There's no need"?

1324
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:03,200
He pours drop by drop.

1325
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,470
Wait a minute.

1326
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:07,100
(He has such a unique personality.)

1327
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,840
- He's a coward. - 14, 15, 16.

1328
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,070
Say just one number.

1329
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,300
(Let me think.)

1330
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,640
(Come on, just try me.)

1331
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:16,740
17.

1332
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,970
- It's okay. - 18, 19, 20.

1333
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:21,870
Aren't you scared at all?

1334
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,070
"Aren't you scared at all?"

1335
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:26,540
What is he talking about?

1336
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,100
- What are you talking about? - Say just one number.

1337
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:29,600
21.

1338
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,270
(Team Black's number is 26.)

1339
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:32,440
I'm starting to forget.

1340
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,870
- Half of the bowl is filled. - It's drenched.

1341
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:36,370
That's a lot of sauce.

1342
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:37,470
No one can eat that.

1343
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:39,470
(There's a trace of the bloody battle on the bowl.)

1344
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:41,700
- The loser has to eat that. - 22, 23.

1345
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,770
(Only a person will be the one to eat the spicy tortilla.)

1346
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,370
- We're still not there? - Just do one.

1347
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:47,600
Just do one.

1348
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:50,770
(They don't hesitate to put more hot sauce.)

1349
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,170
You should go up to 27.

1350
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:55,100
(He goes to 26.)

1351
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,270
Why did you only pretend to pour the hot sauce?

1352
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:59,540
- You didn't put any on there. - He faked it.

1353
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,940
- I did pour it. - No, you didn't.

1354
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,300
(Ji Hyo is brave.)

1355
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,600
(Team Black's number is 26, but it went over 27.)

1356
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:08,100
Are we still not there yet?

1357
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:11,570
- What number did you write down? - Just do one.

1358
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,770
- 28. - No, Seok Jin.

1359
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:18,640
(Seok Jin will get to play with fire.)

1360
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:23,500
(Team Pink wins the second battle.)

1361
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,440
I told you to go up to 27.

1362
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,370
- That was the number? - How did you know?

1363
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:30,700
I had a feeling.

1364
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,340
We should've listened to Ji Soo.

1365
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:36,140
(Seok Jin ruined an almost-won victory.)

1366
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,540
He started it.

1367
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,300
(Seok Jin tries Jeonju's tortilla.)

1368
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,670
It looks funny.

1369
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,640
It's all right. It's not that spicy.

1370
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:46,600
Go, Seok Jin.

1371
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,400
(Jeonju's hot sauce puts Seok Jin on fire.)

1372
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,900
Let's move on.

1373
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,540
(Team Pink won the 3rd round. Team Black won the 4th round.)

1374
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,170
We have to eat that. It's good.

1375
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,500
- It's your turn, Kwang Soo. - That looks good.

1376
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,240
- It's yellow corvina. - It's really delicious.

1377
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,640
That looks so good.

1378
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,070
- Should we start? - Yes.

1379
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,500
- One, two, three. - Let's go, Jong Kook.

1380
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,940
(But Kwang Soo has made it look much spicy.)

1381
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,670
I think 16 is the number. 15.

1382
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:11,670
I go, 16 and 17.

1383
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:13,900
There you go. You should've done one more.

1384
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,370
(Team Black's number is 18.)

1385
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:18,800
(It always gets messy when these two collide.)

1386
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,040
Maybe they wrote down the same number as us.

1387
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:24,700
- 18. - What?

1388
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,400
- What? - 19.

1389
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:29,740
What is this?

1390
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,800
- What's going on here? - Please.

1391
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,170
- Please. - Did you write down a big number?

1392
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:36,770
- Did you say 19? - Yes.

1393
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:39,000
What should we do?

1394
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:40,300
I go 20.

1395
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:44,540
(Jong Kook gets to play with fire.)

1396
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:49,300
(Team Black wins the fifth round.)

1397
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,640
(Team Black's number was 18. Team Pink's number was 22.)

1398
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,470
I got yellow corvina for Lisa.

1399
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,270
For Lisa.

1400
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:57,100
(She's excited.)

1401
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,970
- Bring it over here. - My fish.

1402
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:00,570
(Goodbye, yellow corvina.)

1403
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,570
(It's rare to see the Unlucky Trio celebrating a victory.)

1404
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:07,540
(Let's get this over with.)

1405
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,640
Today's not going very well for you, is it, Jong Kook?

1406
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:12,900
We'll eat it for you.

1407
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,970
- It's okay. - Why do you like Yoon Eun Hye?

1408
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,170
(Have you ever gotten beat up with a tortilla?)

1409
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,440
- What did he say? - I don't know.

1410
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:23,540
I'm just asking out of curiosity. Who did you like more?

1411
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:24,600
Don't answer that.

1412
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,900
Don't answer that. There's no point in answering.

1413
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,340
You should ask him another question.

1414
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,700
- Who did you like more? - Don't answer him.

1415
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,840
Aren't you curious which celebrity he liked the most?

1416
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,240
I already know.

1417
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:35,740
Jae Seok. What are you doing?

1418
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:38,970
- He was just kidding. - I know.

1419
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:40,240
- I know that. - You already know?

1420
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,040
(He takes a bite of the tortilla.)

1421
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,040
My fish.

1422
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,140
(He takes a bite of the tortilla.)

1423
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,140
- The tour isn't over yet. - As a result,

1424
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,040
Team Black will get 40R.

1425
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,500
(Team Black now has 50R. Team Pink now has 70R.)

1426
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,200
And Team Pink will get 20R.

1427
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,040
(Team Black got tteokgalbi, boiled pork, and yellow corvina.)

1428
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,470
(Team Pink got marinated crab and seaweed galbitang.)

1429
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,200
Thank you for the meal.

1430
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:00,870
Thank you.

1431
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:01,900
(It's dinner time with Black Pink.)

1432
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:02,900
(Savoring)

1433
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,340
(Everyone gets one seaweed galbitang each.)

1434
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:09,000
- They all get one each? - It looks so good.

1435
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,240
Can we have one of those?

1436
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,740
No way.

1437
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:16,770
- There's meat in here. - There's so much meat in there.

1438
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,540
Look at the meat.

1439
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,540
It's called. seaweed galbitang. Of course, there's galbi in there.

1440
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,370
- I wasn't expecting this. - I have four pieces.

1441
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:27,040
(Jae Seok fetched a bowl.)

1442
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,500
(It's so satisfying.)

1443
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,940
What was that?

1444
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:33,970
- What are you doing? - Try it, Ji Soo.

1445
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:37,100
You'll shoot a commercial if you do this.

1446
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,370
- Show them what you're capable of. - How do you do it?

1447
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:44,370
(Awestruck)

1448
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:46,900
She killed it.

1449
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:50,000
- She killed it. - Break the stereotype of idols.

1450
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:51,240
That was good.

1451
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,600
- You should do a dialect. - This is delicious.

1452
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:55,400
(I don't know how.)

1453
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,400
Do you not know?

1454
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,900
Lisa is from Thailand. How do you expect her to know dialects?

1455
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,600
Seok Jin said to Lisa,

1456
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,540
"You should do a dialect."

1457
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,670
- I was giving her chance. - Do you take her as Robert Harley?

1458
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:11,700
It'd be funny if she went like, "That's so refreshing."

1459
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,970
"That's so refreshing."

1460
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:16,270
It'd be nice to hear her speak in Jeonju dialect.

1461
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:18,740
"That's so refreshing."

1462
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,500
The rules are the same.

1463
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,000
You can bet on whichever one you want.

1464
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,340
Are we allowed to bet on only one spot?

1465
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:27,300
- For Team Pink, yes. - Right.

1466
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,840
We can bet on two different spots.

1467
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,170
We'll bet 10R on "All Pink".

1468
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:33,400
(Team Pink bets 10R on "All Pink".)

1469
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,600
We'll bet 20R on "Black".

1470
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,600
(Team Black bets 20R on "Black".)

1471
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,700
What's the other one?

1472
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,440
And we'll bet 5R on "All Black".

1473
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,200
- That's right. - Why there?

1474
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,940
- We'll take the lead if we win. - Let's go.

1475
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:48,700
- Let's go. - We need to land it on "Black".

1476
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,170
- That's right. - You two should play.

1477
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:51,370
Oh, no.

1478
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,770
- Go after one another. - Use slippers.

1479
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:55,900
- Should I use slippers? - Yes.

1480
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,400
- You can do it. - Go, Ji Soo!

1481
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,240
- You can do it. - I'm under so much pressure.

1482
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,300
- It's okay, Ji Soo. - I'm afraid I'll keep failing.

1483
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,300
- Don't worry. - You'll be able to do it.

1484
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:09,400
(The only lucky one in the team, Ji Soo, threw her shoe.)

1485
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,240
- Black. - It's on black.

1486
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:15,140
(If it lands on a black tile, it'll favor Team Black.)

1487
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:19,570
(The fate of Team Black lies on Ji Soo's shoe.)

1488
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:20,600
It's on black!

1489
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,740
(Black)

1490
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:23,770
We did it.

1491
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:24,870
It's on black!

1492
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:26,300
(Ji Soo has done it again.)

1493
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,040
We did it.

1494
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:30,940
(Bitter)

1495
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:33,600
- We did it. - Ji Soo is amazing.

1496
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,470
- She's so good. - Come over here.

1497
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,100
Stop doing that.

1498
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:39,570
(Ji Soo and Lisa are quite playful.)

1499
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:40,900
Stop teasing us.

1500
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,840
- We can't go for "All Pink" now. - That's right.

1501
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,640
- It's over. - You have to stop us now.

1502
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,540
We have to stop them from winning.

1503
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:48,600
(Team Black bet 25R in total.)

1504
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,340
(Rose of Team Pink will try to stop Team Black from taking the lead.)

1505
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:53,270
- We'll stop them from winning. - Go for the black tile.

1506
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:55,040
- Black. - Pink.

1507
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,440
- Pink. - Go for the black tile.

1508
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,300
- Black. - Pink.

1509
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,600
Black.

1510
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:06,440
(If it lands on a black tile, it favors Team Black.)

1511
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:11,800
(If it lands on a pink tile, Team Pink will be at mercy.)

1512
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:15,840
(Where will Rose's shoe land on?)

1513
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,270
(It's black again.)

1514
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,200
- Black. - It's black.

1515
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:28,540
(Team Black is ecstatic.)

1516
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,540
- It's okay. - Yes!

1517
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,300
- Oh, no. - It's not your fault.

1518
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,870
We're almost there.

1519
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:38,270
It's either "Black" or "All Black" now.

1520
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:39,770
(Regardless of the result, Team Black's bets are a success.)

1521
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:41,400
- We did it. - No.

1522
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,670
For us, it's better if they get "All Black".

1523
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:45,900
- That's right. - They'll only get 15R, then.

1524
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,840
However, if it lands on R, you will get nothing.

1525
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,470
(If the shoe lands on R, they will fail their bets.)

1526
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:54,070
- Lisa. - Just avoid the R.

1527
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:55,800
No pressure.

1528
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,740
- R is good. - Black.

1529
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:59,540
- R is good. - Black.

1530
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,970
- R. - Black.

1531
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:04,370
(All she needs to do is to avoid the R.)

1532
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:08,100
(Lisa's shoe will decide the result of this game.)

1533
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:12,500
(If it lands on a pink tile, Team Black will get 40R.)

1534
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:17,570
(Wait, it's flying towards the R tile.)

1535
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:19,800
(No way.)

1536
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:23,670
(If it lands on the R tile, Team Black will lose everything.)

1537
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:25,470
- R. - Black.

1538
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:26,540
- R. - Please.

1539
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:28,000
(Will the unlucky guys continue to be unlucky?)

1540
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:31,740
(It landed on the R tile.)

1541
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:35,540
(Among all the 64 tiles, it landed on the R tile.)

1542
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,370
(Let's go, Team Pink.)

1543
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:43,470
(Lisa made history with her bad luck.)

1544
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:49,470
(She's even unluckier than we are.)

1545
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:52,200
This doesn't even make sense.

1546
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,840
They lost everything.

1547
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,140
(She's the unluckiest of all.)

1548
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:57,600
How is this even possible?

1549
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,670
- Oh my goodness. - They lost everything.

1550
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:02,040
(The two teams fail their betting as the result.)

1551
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:03,640
How is this even possible?

1552
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,270
How can something like this happen?

1553
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:09,870
I've never witnessed such bad luck before.

1554
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:12,070
It's okay. We have more than 20R that we started with.

1555
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:13,800
She's so positive.

1556
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,800
I like your attitude.

1557
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,940
Wait. Are you sure it's okay?

1558
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:22,800
(The amount of R coins they currently have.)

1559
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:26,100
The final mission is "Odd-Even Name Tag Elimination".

1560
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,870
- "Odd-Even Name Tag Elimination"? - It's a Name Tag Elimination.

1561
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:31,200
Eliminate the name tags of your opponents and add up the numbers.

1562
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,670
The team to make number seven will become the winner.

1563
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:37,670
Each team will have numbers of 1 to 5 on their name tags.

1564
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,640
People with even numbers will wear red hats.

1565
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,200
People with odd numbers will wear blue hats.

1566
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:49,000
Guess your opponents' numbers and eliminate their name tags.

1567
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:51,900
If you take the name tag off, you will obtain its number.

1568
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:55,300
The team to make number seven will become the winner.

1569
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:59,070
However, you will immediately lose if the added sum goes over eight.

1570
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:02,000
(You will immediately lose if the added sum goes over 8.)

1571
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
This will be hard.

1572
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,670
- We'll have to be smart. - I'm really nervous.

1573
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,200
- We'll have to be smart. - I'm really nervous.

1574
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,000
Let's say the numbers you got are 1 and 3.

1575
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,770
In order to make 7, you need 3, but it's already been used.

1576
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:17,340
In such occasions, the team with the bigger number will win.

1577
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:21,470
If you both have the same numbers, the team to finish first will win.

1578
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:22,540
We'll have to be smart about this.

1579
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:24,940
Go to your headquarters and discuss each other.

1580
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,700
(Their last bets are at stake on this final race.)

1581
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,900
(Time-out)

1582
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:32,070
Even though we lost 25R,

1583
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,700
- It's okay. - Ji Soo and Lisa...

1584
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:37,740
- helped us come this far. - I know.

1585
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:39,600
You're impressive.

1586
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,000
It's because they're very good.

1587
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,840
What happened was a miracle.

1588
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,970
If we continue being like this,

1589
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:47,970
it'll be impossible for us to win.

1590
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:50,070
We'll lose everything.

1591
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:54,770
We could take off the name tags to make a total of seven,

1592
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,540
- but let's make a trap instead. - That's right.

1593
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:59,440
- That's a great idea. - In my opinion,

1594
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,970
- the other team will play safe... - There isn't any specific number...

1595
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:04,600
- that's important. - because they have nothing to lose.

1596
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,970
Team Pink might pick two even numbers.

1597
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:08,100
You're very smart.

1598
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:12,440
They'll take off the name tags from the ones wearing a red hat.

1599
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,900
They won't care about the rest.

1600
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,800
- They might take off 5. - What about 5?

1601
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,240
I'm sure they're also confused, but here's the problem.

1602
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,500
Let's say they obtain two.

1603
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,440
There are only two even numbers.

1604
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,970
They're the most likely targets.

1605
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:27,300
The probability is 50 percent.

1606
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,340
- That's right. - We must think.

1607
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:31,070
Let's just play it randomly.

1608
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:32,870
Really?

1609
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:35,800
- No specific number is important. - If he had been younger,

1610
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,370
I'd have scolded him now.

1611
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,170
I'd have punched him, too.

1612
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:41,100
- It's because... - I think it's better this way.

1613
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:42,100
it's the best way.

1614
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:45,270
The person who's most likely to be eliminated...

1615
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,640
should get a big number like five.

1616
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:51,100
To make it least confusing, drawing straws...

1617
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,940
is the best.

1618
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,200
Then the other team can't predict our numbers.

1619
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:56,600
- Really? - Shall we do that?

1620
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,670
We can't predict what will happen because it isn't a strategy.

1621
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,500
(Which team will win "Odd-Even Name Tag Elimination"?)

1622
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,140
- Will this be okay? - We won't have a strategy?

1623
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:10,500
("Odd-Even Name Tag Elimination" starts.)

1624
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,540
(The time limit is 30 minutes.)

1625
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,700
(They keep their guard up.)

1626
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:15,700
Be careful.

1627
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:17,900
(They keep their guard up.)

1628
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,470
(Is that Team Pink?)

1629
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,640
- Are you okay? - I feel confident.

1630
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:24,700
(Team Black...)

1631
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,470
(approaches Team Pink up close.)

1632
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,300
- Are you okay? - I feel confident.

1633
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,970
(He wants to catch at least one.)

1634
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:39,170
(Ji Hyo comes out while being oblivious.)

1635
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:40,740
(Jae Seok attacks.)

1636
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:41,740
What happened?

1637
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,100
(Jae Seok takes one name tag.)

1638
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,100
What are you doing?

1639
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,870
(Ji Hyo's number is one.)

1640
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:49,100
- Did you start already? - It's one.

1641
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,740
- Ji Hyo's number is one. - It's okay, Ji Hyo.

1642
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:52,270
- I'm going to catch you. - Wait.

1643
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:55,340
(Jae Seok gets counterattacked.)

1644
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:56,640
(Roaring)

1645
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,800
- Try to run away. - Wait a minute.

1646
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,240
Catch him.

1647
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:04,870
(What will happen to Jae Seok after his sudden attack?)

1648
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:05,970
(Tearing)

1649
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,070
Catch him.

1650
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:08,200
(Jae Seok's number is 5.)

1651
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,700
- I'm sorry, Jae Seok. - His number is five.

1652
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,540
(Jae Seok's number is 5.)

1653
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:13,800
We should give something to the other team.

1654
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:16,540
- Do you let them take it off? - To increase their total.

1655
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:17,740
Here you go.

1656
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:20,600
I'll take number five and attack them to increase their total.

1657
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,700
(Their plan is to make the other team's total bigger than eight.)

1658
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:24,000
I think he did it on purpose.

1659
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,600
It's number five.

1660
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,200
(Team Pink can't attack easily now.)

1661
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:29,640
(Current score)

1662
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,400
(Team Black has one.)

1663
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,700
(Team Pink has five.)

1664
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,200
(Team Pink's target is Seok Jin and Lisa.)

1665
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,340
Ji Soo, we got one, and Jae Seok is eliminated.

1666
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,700
- Did he take one? - Be careful.

1667
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,000
We got number one.

1668
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,470
(Team Black needs to make 6 to win.)

1669
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:43,700
I'll go alone first.

1670
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:45,270
If they get you, they'll lose.

1671
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:47,370
I'll go alone.

1672
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:48,470
Shall I come with you?

1673
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:50,470
(Team Black must protect their even numbers.)

1674
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,400
- I'll go with Kwang Soo. - Let's make them confused.

1675
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,170
(The ones with odd numbers go first.)

1676
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:56,000
- Gosh. - It's scary.

1677
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,170
What should we do now?

1678
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,000
- Who should we attack? - Our targets are red hats.

1679
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,240
- Red hats? - Yes.

1680
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:03,400
It's confusing.

1681
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,070
- Which one should we attack? - It's either 2 or 4.

1682
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:07,500
- It's between 2 and 4. - Let's take off all the name tags.

1683
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:10,170
Did Team Black take one? We don't need to attack them.

1684
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:11,540
(The ones in blue hats attack.)

1685
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:12,900
- No. - No.

1686
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:17,000
(If Team Pink takes off 3, they lose immediately.)

1687
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
(Shall I take it off or not?)

1688
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,170
Why aren't you taking mine off?

1689
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:21,970
What happened?

1690
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,700
(She took it off.)

1691
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,670
- I told you not to take it off! - Yes.

1692
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:31,400
(Haha's number is five.)

1693
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,070
(Team Black takes off 5 after 1.)

1694
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:36,770
- We did it. - I told you not to take it off.

1695
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:38,370
It's okay.

1696
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,240
My number was five.

1697
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,870
It's okay.

1698
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,770
- They're doomed. - It was perfect.

1699
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:47,070
Team Black is doomed now.

1700
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,870
I let them take mine off.

1701
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:50,400
If we take off one of theirs...

1702
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,600
(It's going according to our plan.)

1703
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:55,470
- That was amazing. - They can't attack us anymore.

1704
01:05:55,470 --> 01:05:57,300
She fell for it.

1705
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:59,600
- We're going to win. - Good job.

1706
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,000
(Team Black can't take off any more name tags.)

1707
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,340
- We won. - The game is over.

1708
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,070
(What should we do?)

1709
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:07,700
I told you not to take it off.

1710
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:10,070
- I told you not to. - Why did you do it?

1711
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,800
- I took it off. - Our total is six.

1712
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,770
- Six? - What happened?

1713
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:16,340
Our total is now six.

1714
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:19,270
- They can't run very fast. - We can't take off any.

1715
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:21,600
- We can't take off any. - We can't anymore.

1716
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,000
(Team Black has 6. Team Pink has 5.)

1717
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,600
We can't take off their name tags anymore.

1718
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,100
We can't let them take off ours for 30 minutes.

1719
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:28,400
- That's right. - For 30 minutes?

1720
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,170
Either they take off a big number or don't take off any.

1721
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:33,140
Neither of the two can be attacked, and we'll keep running.

1722
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,500
Do we attack one of the red hats?

1723
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:37,900
Don't we lose if we take off number four?

1724
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,900
- We're at an advantage. - Right.

1725
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,000
Is it Seok Jin or Lisa?

1726
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,370
(All they need is number two.)

1727
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:46,740
Is it Seok Jin or Lisa?

1728
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:47,970
Maybe it's Lisa.

1729
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,870
(Which one of them has number two?)

1730
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:56,170
(They have 10 minutes left.)

1731
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:58,340
- We have to keep running away. - Do we tie if they take off mine?

1732
01:06:58,370 --> 01:07:00,340
- That's right. - Right?

1733
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:02,070
You two aren't important.

1734
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:04,740
Team Pink will attack either me or Lisa.

1735
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:07,170
(Team Pink's target is an even number.)

1736
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:08,740
- Isn't that right? - Yes.

1737
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:11,240
- Shall we move separately? - No, we should stay together.

1738
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:12,370
Stay together.

1739
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,970
Gosh, they're coming.

1740
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:17,640
Let them come.

1741
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,270
- Start running. - We must run away.

1742
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:22,870
(Team Pink chases them quickly.)

1743
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,100
(I'm a dinosaur.)

1744
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,440
- What? - It's Lisa.

1745
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:31,570
- It's Lisa. - Take hers off.

1746
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:34,100
- It's either Lisa. - Or it's Seok Jin.

1747
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:35,600
Take it off.

1748
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,000
- Did she take it off? - Who could it be?

1749
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,370
- Who could it be? - Do you have number two?

1750
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:43,340
- I think it's Lisa. - It's her.

1751
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,800
I think Lisa has it.

1752
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:48,800
(Seok Jin is left on his own.)

1753
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:52,370
(Jong Kook has his eyes on him.)

1754
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,840
You have 10 minutes left.

1755
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,070
Jennie.

1756
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:58,700
It's Seok Jin.

1757
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,870
- It's Seok Jin. - No, stop it.

1758
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:02,070
(Our target is Seok Jin.)

1759
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:03,400
It's Seok Jin.

1760
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,600
No, stop it.

1761
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:06,500
Get away.

1762
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,900
(It's over if Seok Jin gets caught.)

1763
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:11,570
(Jong Kook heads towards Seok Jin.)

1764
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:16,170
(They need 2 to make a total of 7.)

1765
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:20,700
(Is it Seok Jin or Lisa?)

1766
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:23,170
(They run after Seok Jin.)

1767
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,000
Get away.

1768
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,440
Seok Jin.

1769
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,440
(Tearing)

1770
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,900
(Jong Kook takes off the whole name tag.)

1771
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:36,570
(What's the number behind Seok Jin's name tag?)

1772
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,200
What's going on? Why did they take off Seok Jin's?

1773
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:44,000
(Team Pink's fate depends on...)

1774
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,900
(the result of Jong Kook's decision.)

1775
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,110
I think it's four.

1776
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:51,200
(Is it 2 or 4?)

1777
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:55,700
(Seok Jin's number is four.)

1778
01:08:57,070 --> 01:09:01,500
(Team Pink loses with a total higher than 7.)

1779
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:06,740
(Team Black's plan worked.)

1780
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:09,200
(30 minutes before)

1781
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:12,800
(Seok Jin chose number 4.)

1782
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,170
They won't know whose to take off, so how we act is important.

1783
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:18,340
- It's Lisa. - It's her.

1784
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:19,610
(He pretended to have number two.)

1785
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:22,740
(As he moved away, he led Jong Kook to attack him.)

1786
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:26,900
(Jong Kook fell for the bait.)

1787
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:31,700
(Team Black's plan turned out to be a success.)

1788
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:33,300
We got them.

1789
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:37,940
Our plan worked.

1790
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,300
Our plan really worked.

1791
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,500
(Team Pink fell for the trap.)

1792
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:44,170
It was Seok Jin's acting.

1793
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:46,470
Good job.

1794
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:49,440
(Members with even numbers brought victory to the team.)

1795
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,970
For "Odd-Even Name Tag Elimination",

1796
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:55,440
Team Black wins.

1797
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:59,610
(Team Black wins.)

1798
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,700
It's not over yet.

1799
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:04,170
- We have another game left. - Of course.

1800
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:06,640
Team Pink will make their bet first.

1801
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,500
Good luck with how you calculate.

1802
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,870
We're going to bet everything.

1803
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,640
To win the flight ticket to Europe...

1804
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:14,640
- This isn't enough. - Do you mean all black?

1805
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:17,370
- Isn't this not enough? - No.

1806
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:18,870
- We need to make this bet. - We do.

1807
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:21,540
- Shall we bet on this? - We'll need to bet 50R.

1808
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:22,610
All right.

1809
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:24,640
We don't have to bet 50R.

1810
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:25,670
We can bet just 40R.

1811
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:27,540
(They plan to earn 5 times the amount by betting 40R.)

1812
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:29,400
Let's bet 40R and see what happens.

1813
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:30,500
- Okay? - That sounds good.

1814
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,140
- Let's keep 20R. - Okay.

1815
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,000
Let's give it a try.

1816
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,840
We might win Jeonju Seasoned Laver Set.

1817
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,970
Let's make a bet for the last time.

1818
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:40,070
40R on placing a shoe on the R square?

1819
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:42,000
- Isn't that disadvantageous? - Just make any bet, Lisa.

1820
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,400
It doesn't matter which you bet on.

1821
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:47,270
Team Black will make their bet after throwing a shoe.

1822
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:48,940
- Just make it into any square. - Okay.

1823
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,740
Lisa, please throw the shoe.

1824
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:54,270
If she throws it into the R tile, we'll put the next one in 2R.

1825
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:55,740
- To make it 10? - The next should be in 2R.

1826
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:57,240
(Team Black's bet depends on where she throws in her shoe.)

1827
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:00,240
- You can do it. - Go, Lisa.

1828
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:04,610
(To where will she throw her shoe?)

1829
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:08,870
(Will it make it to the R tile again?)

1830
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,640
It's going towards the R.

1831
01:11:14,110 --> 01:11:15,110
It's a black square.

1832
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:18,070
(It's in a black square.)

1833
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:20,300
Should we make it "Three Black"?

1834
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,770
What would we get?

1835
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:24,570
- We'll get Tteokgalbi Set. - Tteokgalbi Set?

1836
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:27,070
It's because it multiplies. Let's go for "Black".

1837
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:28,140
Let's go for "Black".

1838
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,110
- Let's win tteokgalbi at least. - Okay.

1839
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:31,940
We should win tteokgalbi at least.

1840
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:34,800
We'll cook it when we get back to the dormitory.

1841
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,300
(Team Black makes a bet of 25R on "Black".)

1842
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:38,440
- Let's bet 25R coins. - 25R coins?

1843
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,000
We are done betting as well.

1844
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,470
- Jong Kook, you can do it. - Yes, you can.

1845
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,270
- Don't think too much. - You can do it.

1846
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:47,070
- You can do it. - It will be hard for him.

1847
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:48,240
It's okay as long as it doesn't go into the R square.

1848
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:52,270
- No way, he'll make it. - Kick it like that.

1849
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:54,440
- Is he aiming? - Just don't make it land in R.

1850
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,770
- It's impossible to aim. - Right.

1851
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:58,040
(Their fate depends on the R tile.)

1852
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:04,000
(Where will Jong Kook's shoe land into?)

1853
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,800
(Is it the R square?)

1854
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,700
(Stopping)

1855
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:17,740
(Some shout with joy and other with sorrow.)

1856
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:19,070
It went into the black tile again.

1857
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:20,400
That was so close.

1858
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,740
- We need a pink box. - We almost had it.

1859
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:23,200
- We need it to go into a pink box. - Right.

1860
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,170
(So far, two shoes fell into black boxes.)

1861
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:27,900
- We need a pink square. - This time, we are kicking.

1862
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,470
(With one pink tile, their betting will be successful.)

1863
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:30,700
Your shoe went into the pink box before.

1864
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,400
- You do it again. - You can do it.

1865
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,340
- I'm sure you'll get the pink. - You can do it.

1866
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:36,670
(Jae Seok gets ready to kick.)

1867
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:42,940
(He shoe kept landing on pink squares before.)

1868
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,740
(This is the time for him to get his groove on.)

1869
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:48,110
- He can do it. - It'll go into a black box.

1870
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:51,500
(No way. I can't let it fall into a pink square.)

1871
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:58,640
(Will he be able to hold up his reputation?)

1872
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:05,270
(They're chanting a spell to make it fall into a black box.)

1873
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,770
(Don't let it influence you.)

1874
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:11,140
(He gets ready and concentrates.)

1875
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:12,800
- It'll be the R box. - R box is the worst.

1876
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,110
- Let's go with the R box. - Yes, we should.

1877
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:16,540
Yes, let's go with the R box, Jae Seok.

1878
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:18,370
Why don't we make it more interesting?

1879
01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:19,610
I don't feel confident.

1880
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:21,540
I am not confident anymore.

1881
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:22,870
- What's wrong? - Kwang Soo,

1882
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:24,240
- I can't do this. - You'll be okay.

1883
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,840
- You can do it, Jae Seok. - Ji Soo,

1884
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,640
- I don't feel confident. - I have a feeling you will do well.

1885
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,140
- You get the pink box. - That's more likely.

1886
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:31,000
- I have a good feeling about this. - I'm going crazy.

1887
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,340
(He's getting ready.)

1888
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:34,070
(He stands behind the line again.)

1889
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:37,870
- Let's get the R box. - You'll get the R box.

1890
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:40,500
(I won't let them influence me.)

1891
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,440
- You can only get the pink box. - Get the R box.

1892
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:47,140
(He kicks his shoe.)

1893
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:54,740
(The fate of two teams depends on this shoe.)

1894
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:59,670
(With which team...)

1895
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:05,070
(will Queen of Victory side?)

1896
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:12,470
(The shoe falls into the black box.)

1897
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:15,440
(I can't believe this.)

1898
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,070
- We won. - Awesome.

1899
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:19,740
(The last shoe went into the black box.)

1900
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:22,040
(Your misery is my happiness.)

1901
01:14:22,770 --> 01:14:24,840
You should've strongly argued that you weren't confident.

1902
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:27,440
Don't volunteer if you can't deliver.

1903
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,900
- When did I volunteer? - You didn't get the pink box.

1904
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,070
My goodness.

1905
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:33,270
- I mean... - Our plan never works.

1906
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:36,000
We can't never have it our way. Why is that?

1907
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:37,540
- How is this possible? - We're sorry.

1908
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:39,700
- Don't worry about it. - That's okay.

1909
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:41,610
We're fine.

1910
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:44,770
(Team Pink takes Jeonju Seasoned Laver Set with 20R.)

1911
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:46,370
- You should take them all. - I have so much.

1912
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:47,870
What am I going to do with all these?

1913
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:49,040
- Take them. - Yes, please do.

1914
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,670
- Enjoy them. - Thank you.

1915
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:52,970
(Jennie gets enough laver sets.)

1916
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,740
We are truly the unlucky team.

1917
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,900
Let's try this again with the same team.

1918
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:01,300
- They don't seem so happy. - It was a lot of fun.

1919
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:03,440
Let's give a round of applause for Blackpink.

1920
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,870
(Thank you for working so hard on a cold day.)

1921
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:06,610
- Thank you. - You're the best.

1922
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,500
- Let's meet again. - And...

1923
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:11,800
we filmed in Jeonju for two weeks.

1924
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,440
- We had a lot of delicious food. - It was amazing.

1925
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,110
- Jeonju is beautiful all year long. - That's right.

1926
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:19,670
Thank you for your cooperation.

1927
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:21,370
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1928
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:24,740
(We'll strive to be better.)

1929
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:30,270
(Welcome)

1930
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,840
(I prepared you a present.)

1931
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,070
(I prepared a curse for you.)

1932
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:37,900
(The curse of a bad Santa)

1933
01:15:38,570 --> 01:15:40,670
(The winter of 2016)

1934
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,770
(The curse of a bad Santa visits Running Man.)

1935
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:46,270
I am not joking.

1936
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:51,740
(Don't let the innocent faces fool you. What is the truth?)

1937
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,470
(Christmas with Bad Santa)
