1
00:00:05,378 --> 00:00:07,278
Ji Sung heads from the right-back.

2
00:00:07,348 --> 00:00:09,748
(January 10, 2016, Shanghai Hongkou Stadium)

3
00:00:09,818 --> 00:00:12,178
He receives the ball. Haha is quick to receive.

4
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:13,648
It's a perfect opportunity.

5
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:15,548
Seok Jin is in shadow play.

6
00:00:15,918 --> 00:00:17,088
Seok Jin is in the centre.

7
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:19,448
- Seok Jin attempts a header. - Seok Jin!

8
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,348
(Jumping)

9
00:00:21,378 --> 00:00:23,978
(Heading)

10
00:00:23,978 --> 00:00:26,678
(And an amazing story...)

11
00:00:26,748 --> 00:00:30,878
(unravels.)

12
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:33,848
(Running Man in Shanghai)

13
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:35,918
(Running Man)

14
00:00:35,978 --> 00:00:38,548
(Mission Impossible in Shanghai)

15
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:40,378
(Transcending time and space,)

16
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,578
(running through Shanghai's past, present and future)

17
00:00:42,648 --> 00:00:43,718
I can't trust anyone.

18
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:46,278
It's becoming more difficult.

19
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:47,448
(Running Man in Shanghai starts now.)

20
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:51,778
(Flying)

21
00:00:55,178 --> 00:00:59,078
(Seven drones are flying across the winter sky.)

22
00:00:59,178 --> 00:01:00,578
(What is going on?)

23
00:01:00,648 --> 00:01:01,978
- You need my approval for this. - This isn't good news for you.

24
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,848
- What? - Look at that!

25
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:09,678
(The object attached under the drone is a football.)

26
00:01:09,748 --> 00:01:10,748
There are seven of them.

27
00:01:10,818 --> 00:01:12,578
- It looks really cool. - It's amazing.

28
00:01:12,778 --> 00:01:14,918
- It's heading this way. - Come over here.

29
00:01:15,278 --> 00:01:17,888
(Those drones are headed straight...)

30
00:01:17,948 --> 00:01:18,948
(to the seven members of Running Man.)

31
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,478
- Come on over here. - It's a football.

32
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:21,718
- The drones are coming closer. - It's coming to us.

33
00:01:21,778 --> 00:01:22,878
- It's coming nearer. - Be careful.

34
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:23,978
Come over to me.

35
00:01:24,278 --> 00:01:26,578
(The drones fly precisely towards their target members.)

36
00:01:26,678 --> 00:01:27,718
- Oh, my. - Over here!

37
00:01:27,778 --> 00:01:29,578
- Come over here! - I can't reach it yet.

38
00:01:30,978 --> 00:01:31,978
It's here.

39
00:01:33,178 --> 00:01:34,718
(The footballs...)

40
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:37,448
(drop down.)

41
00:01:38,778 --> 00:01:39,978
Yes, over here.

42
00:01:42,578 --> 00:01:43,578
Now!

43
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:45,648
I've got the football.

44
00:01:46,178 --> 00:01:47,578
(Who, for what reason, sent the footballs?)

45
00:01:47,678 --> 00:01:49,178
The drones delivered the footballs.

46
00:01:49,448 --> 00:01:51,178
Oh, my.

47
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:52,718
- What is that? - What is it?

48
00:01:52,778 --> 00:01:54,078
- It looks like a present. - Maybe it's an invitation.

49
00:01:54,178 --> 00:01:55,378
(And...)

50
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:57,348
(this isn't all?)

51
00:01:59,848 --> 00:02:01,078
Come over here.

52
00:02:01,348 --> 00:02:02,578
(It doesn't look like a football this time.)

53
00:02:02,678 --> 00:02:05,978
- It looks so high-tech. - With these, you can...

54
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:08,578
The drones makes deliveries.

55
00:02:08,578 --> 00:02:11,288
(Dropping)

56
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:12,448
And off it goes.

57
00:02:13,478 --> 00:02:15,378
It's so high-tech these days.

58
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:17,288
It's a message.

59
00:02:17,348 --> 00:02:18,978
(It is a message box.)

60
00:02:19,078 --> 00:02:20,288
(Who sent the message box?)

61
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,378
Someone recorded the message.

62
00:02:21,978 --> 00:02:23,948
Turn up the volume.

63
00:02:26,448 --> 00:02:27,448
(It's Park Ji Sung.)

64
00:02:27,478 --> 00:02:28,788
Hey, Ji Sung!

65
00:02:33,378 --> 00:02:34,788
Hello, I am Park Ji Sung.

66
00:02:35,178 --> 00:02:37,478
(Return of the Captain)

67
00:02:38,748 --> 00:02:42,948
(Korea's one and only, all-time Captain, Ji Sung)

68
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:45,778
("Ji Sung is perfect in any role he is assigned to." Alex Ferguson)

69
00:02:45,848 --> 00:02:48,578
(Asia's star football player that played 154 games in Premier League)

70
00:02:49,778 --> 00:02:53,578
(After retiring, he performs as an ambassador of Manchester United.)

71
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,848
(The recent big news was...)

72
00:02:56,918 --> 00:03:00,818
(that he has become the captain of his family with his baby girl.)

73
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:06,678
(Running Man's all-time hero and beloved friend, Park Ji Sung)

74
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:08,648
(What is the message...)

75
00:03:08,718 --> 00:03:10,978
(that Ji Sung sent?)

76
00:03:13,178 --> 00:03:14,448
Hello, I am Park Ji Sung.

77
00:03:14,478 --> 00:03:17,378
I am headed to Shanghai as I have been invited to FC Smile Cup.

78
00:03:17,578 --> 00:03:19,478
I hope to see all of you.

79
00:03:19,548 --> 00:03:21,078
He's become so gentle now.

80
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:24,878
I hope to see all of you in China...

81
00:03:24,978 --> 00:03:26,978
when you arrive.

82
00:03:27,278 --> 00:03:29,678
I'll be waiting for you.

83
00:03:32,648 --> 00:03:34,918
(Captain Park's invitation that will lead Running Man to Shanghai)

84
00:03:34,978 --> 00:03:36,478
Are we going to Shanghai?

85
00:03:36,578 --> 00:03:38,078
Oh, is that so?

86
00:03:38,078 --> 00:03:40,178
I'm going to score a goal this time.

87
00:03:40,278 --> 00:03:41,878
We're having...

88
00:03:41,948 --> 00:03:44,718
- another charity football match. - We should do it.

89
00:03:44,778 --> 00:03:46,078
I'm going to score a goal this time.

90
00:03:46,178 --> 00:03:48,948
You even missed the penalty kick the other time.

91
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:53,178
(Jae Seok never scored a goal once in three of the previous games.)

92
00:03:53,478 --> 00:03:55,978
(Jae Seok struggles on the field.)

93
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:58,578
(He falls over all by himself and gets knocked over too.)

94
00:03:58,678 --> 00:04:01,178
(His passes never seem to get through clean.)

95
00:04:01,278 --> 00:04:04,178
(Six years of total disaster on the field)

96
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:07,748
- My mission to touch the ball... - But...

97
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,078
do you know you are terrible at football?

98
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:12,178
(Burst of anger)

99
00:04:12,278 --> 00:04:13,548
Excuse me,

100
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:15,178
but let aside your pride.

101
00:04:15,178 --> 00:04:17,748
I'd rather have you call me a terrible singer.

102
00:04:18,088 --> 00:04:19,648
- No, you're a superb singer. - Nothing's wrong with your singing.

103
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,278
Just make fun of my singing instead.

104
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:23,178
You're a great singer but a poor football player.

105
00:04:23,378 --> 00:04:24,548
- He is really bad at football. - Please, I beg you.

106
00:04:24,588 --> 00:04:25,778
That's nonsense.

107
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,448
Please be aware of your footballs and we'll head to Shanghai.

108
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:30,918
- All right! - We're off to Shanghai!

109
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:31,978
Let's go!

110
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,778
(Running Man in Shanghai, the mission begins.)

111
00:04:36,948 --> 00:04:39,478
(Incheon International Airport)

112
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:45,378
(Haha arrives with his football.)

113
00:04:45,448 --> 00:04:47,178
Here I come, Shanghai.

114
00:04:47,178 --> 00:04:49,588
Here I come, Ji Sung.

115
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:51,548
(Startled)

116
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:54,918
(Have a safe trip!)

117
00:04:55,178 --> 00:04:56,178
Here I come, Ji Sung.

118
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:57,978
Congratulations, Ji Sung,

119
00:04:58,088 --> 00:04:59,588
on your newborn baby girl.

120
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:01,948
But did you have to ignore my text?

121
00:05:05,378 --> 00:05:09,548
(Following Haha,)

122
00:05:09,588 --> 00:05:12,178
(Jong Kook arrives.)

123
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,088
Is this the right way?

124
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:19,378
(My precious)

125
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:23,918
(Jae Seok looks a little tense.)

126
00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:24,978
(Ji Hyo is excited and ready.)

127
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:26,088
See you later.

128
00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:28,478
(Nervous Jae Seok and excited Ji Hyo are ready.)

129
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:31,178
It will be different this time.

130
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:33,078
I've been practising.

131
00:05:33,948 --> 00:05:37,078
(Will Seok Jin be able to even touch the football this time?)

132
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,078
I think I'd better sign this football before scoring a goal.

133
00:05:42,178 --> 00:05:43,678
I will score a goal with this.

134
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:44,748
(Looking all too eager)

135
00:05:44,818 --> 00:05:45,948
I can't even handle it though.

136
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:46,978
(Lacking the skills)

137
00:05:47,078 --> 00:05:48,278
I'm all set.

138
00:05:49,178 --> 00:05:52,478
I've been thinking of football all this past year.

139
00:05:52,878 --> 00:05:54,478
I even played football in my dreams.

140
00:05:54,848 --> 00:05:57,578
I'll show you all I have.

141
00:05:57,978 --> 00:05:58,978
I will not...

142
00:05:59,948 --> 00:06:01,378
let you down.

143
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:05,818
(Full of passion)

144
00:06:07,078 --> 00:06:08,378
I'll make sure to score one goal.

145
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:11,748
Goodbye, everyone.

146
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:23,478
(Shanghai)

147
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:27,848
(Running Man arrives in Shanghai.)

148
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:34,648
(Shanghai is China's largest city situated at the mouth of Yangtze.)

149
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:40,448
(It is the heart of China's culture and business.)

150
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,548
(Where China's past, present and future co-exist.)

151
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:46,178
(And...)

152
00:06:46,178 --> 00:06:50,548
(where the game will be held, Hongkou Stadium)

153
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,878
(Today,)

154
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:54,978
(on this field,)

155
00:06:54,978 --> 00:06:56,378
(we will...)

156
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:59,278
(write history.)

157
00:07:02,778 --> 00:07:06,978
(Seven o'clock in the morning, the day of the match)

158
00:07:11,378 --> 00:07:12,578
(Someone opens the door.)

159
00:07:17,648 --> 00:07:20,048
(Creeping in)

160
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,578
(Tip-toeing in)

161
00:07:32,978 --> 00:07:36,478
(The production crew are sneaking into the members' rooms.)

162
00:07:38,818 --> 00:07:45,978
(Room 716, Jong Kook's room)

163
00:07:46,078 --> 00:07:51,678
(Room 617, Gary's room)

164
00:07:53,748 --> 00:07:58,718
(Room 610, Seok Jin's room)

165
00:08:01,278 --> 00:08:04,478
(Room 816, Kwang Soo's room)

166
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:12,578
(Room 616, Ji Hyo's room)

167
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,818
(Room 817, Jae Seok's room)

168
00:08:16,878 --> 00:08:18,178
(Sound asleep)

169
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:20,578
(Room 817, Jae Seok's room)

170
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,678
(The phone rings.)

171
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:30,348
Gosh.

172
00:08:31,948 --> 00:08:33,278
(Startled)

173
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:40,478
(The phone rings.)

174
00:08:49,548 --> 00:08:50,978
(Jumping upright)

175
00:08:58,188 --> 00:09:00,078
(The phone rings.)

176
00:09:00,188 --> 00:09:02,948
(I can't be bothered to get that.)

177
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:10,918
(He goes all the way to the living room to answer the call.)

178
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:12,148
(Hello)

179
00:09:12,248 --> 00:09:13,248
What?

180
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:16,048
(He's surprised.)

181
00:09:16,118 --> 00:09:18,748
(How did these people get in here?)

182
00:09:24,548 --> 00:09:25,548
Hello?

183
00:09:26,018 --> 00:09:27,478
(Why is someone calling them in the morning?)

184
00:09:27,618 --> 00:09:28,648
Hello?

185
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:30,148
- Good morning. - Right.

186
00:09:30,248 --> 00:09:31,548
I'm Park Ji Sung.

187
00:09:31,648 --> 00:09:33,548
What?

188
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:34,848
I'm Park Ji Sung.

189
00:09:35,648 --> 00:09:39,018
I called to inform you about today's mission.

190
00:09:39,048 --> 00:09:42,018
Please find the football in another member's room...

191
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,648
and come to the garden.

192
00:09:43,648 --> 00:09:46,948
You can complete your mission by scoring a goal in the goalpost...

193
00:09:47,048 --> 00:09:48,218
that's in the garden.

194
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:51,918
You should head out as soon as possible.

195
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:55,018
But you are not allowed to take your own ball out of your room.

196
00:09:55,148 --> 00:09:56,548
Please begin.

197
00:09:56,648 --> 00:09:58,148
(Their morning mission begins.)

198
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:01,848
I'm sorry. I didn't understand a thing you said.

199
00:10:03,648 --> 00:10:05,348
What on earth is going on?

200
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,548
(Sighing)

201
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:11,648
(What is going on?)

202
00:10:14,478 --> 00:10:15,748
They're making me exercise...

203
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,018
(She's mad that they woke her up.)

204
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:18,418
so early in the morning.

205
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:19,448
(They're making me exercise so early in the morning.)

206
00:10:19,748 --> 00:10:22,648
(Ji Hyo climbs out of the bed.)

207
00:10:24,148 --> 00:10:28,048
(The phone rings in Seok Jin's room.)

208
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,618
(They have to quickly hide their balls.)

209
00:10:37,648 --> 00:10:38,648
Where should I hide this?

210
00:10:39,248 --> 00:10:41,118
Jong Kook is in the room next to mine.

211
00:10:41,648 --> 00:10:42,748
What should I do?

212
00:10:43,148 --> 00:10:44,148
Where should I hide this?

213
00:10:44,218 --> 00:10:46,048
(Where should I hide this?)

214
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,478
(They have to hide their balls well.)

215
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,378
(And find others' balls as quickly as possible.)

216
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:53,018
No, that's too easy.

217
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:56,748
(A lot of the members...)

218
00:10:56,848 --> 00:11:01,378
(are hiding their balls on the window ledge behind the curtains.)

219
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:04,448
(Haha, Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo are done hiding their balls.)

220
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:07,948
(We will now begin today's morning mission.)

221
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:11,478
(Mumbling)

222
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:13,948
(Gary just got up.)

223
00:11:14,018 --> 00:11:15,048
Goodness.

224
00:11:15,118 --> 00:11:17,278
(He looks for a place to hide his ball.)

225
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:19,648
There's nowhere to hide my ball.

226
00:11:21,118 --> 00:11:22,948
(He's found a spot.)

227
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:24,918
(This is unexpected.)

228
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:27,748
(He's hiding it in the bathroom ceiling.)

229
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:30,048
(He's quite proud of himself.)

230
00:11:31,318 --> 00:11:33,348
(Jae Seok's room, Kwang Soo's room)

231
00:11:35,148 --> 00:11:37,618
(I am here to take your ball.)

232
00:11:37,648 --> 00:11:40,148
- Good morning. - Are you...

233
00:11:40,218 --> 00:11:41,948
- serious? - Where did you hide it?

234
00:11:42,048 --> 00:11:43,448
You've got to be kidding me.

235
00:11:43,518 --> 00:11:44,548
(He just asked Jae Seok where he hid it.)

236
00:11:44,648 --> 00:11:46,278
- Come on, you... - I don't have much time.

237
00:11:46,348 --> 00:11:47,618
- Are you serious? - Jae Seok.

238
00:11:48,318 --> 00:11:49,478
Hey.

239
00:11:49,548 --> 00:11:51,518
(Jae Seok is going for Kwang Soo's ball.)

240
00:11:51,548 --> 00:11:54,048
(Jae Seok runs into Kwang Soo's empty room.)

241
00:11:54,118 --> 00:11:55,148
(They went all the way to Shanghai for this.)

242
00:11:55,218 --> 00:11:56,548
Ouch.

243
00:11:57,278 --> 00:11:58,948
There's nowhere to hide it over here.

244
00:11:59,548 --> 00:12:02,448
(He found it.)

245
00:12:03,218 --> 00:12:05,748
(Jae Seok rushes to the garden with Kwang Soo's ball.)

246
00:12:06,648 --> 00:12:08,418
Where on earth did he hide it?

247
00:12:09,348 --> 00:12:11,318
When did you guys get here?

248
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:14,348
No, you can't!

249
00:12:14,418 --> 00:12:17,148
(Gary runs towards Seok Jin to take his ball.)

250
00:12:17,248 --> 00:12:18,248
No!

251
00:12:18,348 --> 00:12:20,848
(Seok Jin hasn't even hidden his ball yet.)

252
00:12:22,748 --> 00:12:25,048
- Just let me be. - Stay still.

253
00:12:25,148 --> 00:12:27,218
- Just go to my room and take mine. - Stop.

254
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:29,218
- Which room are you in? - 616.

255
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:30,348
- What? - 616.

256
00:12:30,418 --> 00:12:31,748
616.

257
00:12:32,748 --> 00:12:35,118
(Jae Seok is already passing through the lobby.)

258
00:12:37,748 --> 00:12:38,948
(Running)

259
00:12:39,018 --> 00:12:40,048
I'm the first one here.

260
00:12:40,648 --> 00:12:41,748
Should I do it from over here?

261
00:12:42,548 --> 00:12:46,948
(He has to score a goal with someone else's ball.)

262
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:50,948
(Will Kwang Soo be eliminated if I score this goal?)

263
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:54,378
Come on.

264
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:56,248
(He fails.)

265
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:59,378
(He has to pick up the ball.)

266
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:03,848
(Jae Seok's second attempt)

267
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:06,648
(Will he score this time?)

268
00:13:06,848 --> 00:13:07,848
(Bouncing off)

269
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:10,118
Oh, no.

270
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:12,118
Come on.

271
00:13:13,848 --> 00:13:15,648
It's nowhere to be found.

272
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,618
(He's determined to score.)

273
00:13:17,648 --> 00:13:20,348
(Jae Seok shoots.)

274
00:13:20,418 --> 00:13:21,448
Goal.

275
00:13:21,518 --> 00:13:23,448
(Jae Seok scores.)

276
00:13:25,048 --> 00:13:26,148
(Kwang Soo is in the seventh place.)

277
00:13:26,218 --> 00:13:27,318
Seriously...

278
00:13:27,618 --> 00:13:29,218
Kwang Soo barged into my room first.

279
00:13:29,848 --> 00:13:32,648
Last night, we had a good long conversation on...

280
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:34,548
how we should do our best today.

281
00:13:35,218 --> 00:13:36,548
How dare he..

282
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:39,948
(Kwang Soo is still in Jae Seok's room.)

283
00:13:40,048 --> 00:13:41,048
No way.

284
00:13:44,318 --> 00:13:46,048
He must be crazy.

285
00:13:46,748 --> 00:13:49,948
This isn't "Mission Impossible".

286
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:52,318
Was this really necessary?

287
00:13:53,348 --> 00:13:54,478
Hey.

288
00:13:55,218 --> 00:13:56,248
Hey, Gary.

289
00:13:56,948 --> 00:13:58,148
- There's no one else here? - Seok Jin...

290
00:13:58,218 --> 00:13:59,848
- You have to score from here. - What?

291
00:13:59,918 --> 00:14:00,948
(He has to score a goal.)

292
00:14:01,378 --> 00:14:03,548
(Haha arrives at the garden with Jong Kook's ball.)

293
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:05,648
Yes!

294
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:08,748
Yes!

295
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,348
(Gary scores. Seok Jin is in the sixth place.)

296
00:14:13,448 --> 00:14:16,448
(Haha shoots and he scores with Jong Kook's ball.)

297
00:14:16,518 --> 00:14:17,848
Yes!

298
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,248
(Kim Jong Kook is in the fifth place.)

299
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:23,048
- There he is. - He's already here.

300
00:14:23,118 --> 00:14:24,218
- He's here. - Over there.

301
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:25,348
Where?

302
00:14:25,418 --> 00:14:26,448
(Kwang Soo arrives first.)

303
00:14:26,518 --> 00:14:27,948
Whose ball is...

304
00:14:28,018 --> 00:14:29,048
(Kwang Soo kicks Jae Seok's ball.)

305
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,118
Goal.

306
00:14:30,148 --> 00:14:32,848
(Surprisingly, Kwang Soo scored in one try.)

307
00:14:32,948 --> 00:14:34,448
(Kwang Soo scores with Jae Seok's football.)

308
00:14:34,518 --> 00:14:35,848
(Jae Seok is in the fourth place.)

309
00:14:35,948 --> 00:14:37,648
- He scored. - Just kick it?

310
00:14:38,248 --> 00:14:39,248
Just kick it from here?

311
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:43,548
(Jong Kook scores with Haha's ball.)

312
00:14:44,348 --> 00:14:45,348
(Panting)

313
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:46,548
Here he comes.

314
00:14:46,848 --> 00:14:48,418
- You found it first? - What?

315
00:14:48,918 --> 00:14:51,218
- Whose ball is that? - He really...

316
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:54,118
- doesn't hold back. - Whose ball is that?

317
00:14:56,748 --> 00:14:57,748
(Kicking)

318
00:14:58,548 --> 00:15:00,148
(It wasn't...)

319
00:15:00,218 --> 00:15:02,448
(even close to the goalpost.)

320
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:04,048
Great job.

321
00:15:04,118 --> 00:15:05,148
(Is he doing this on purpose?)

322
00:15:05,218 --> 00:15:06,648
He's really bad.

323
00:15:07,018 --> 00:15:09,548
I think he just exhausted his energy for today.

324
00:15:09,648 --> 00:15:11,148
He must be exhausted.

325
00:15:12,648 --> 00:15:13,748
Ji Hyo's here.

326
00:15:13,848 --> 00:15:15,348
It's over if she scores first.

327
00:15:15,418 --> 00:15:16,548
Hurry up.

328
00:15:16,648 --> 00:15:19,478
(The only balls that are left are Ji Hyo's and Seok Jin's.)

329
00:15:19,548 --> 00:15:20,648
It's over if you score first.

330
00:15:20,648 --> 00:15:22,278
(Ji Hyo shoots first.)

331
00:15:22,348 --> 00:15:23,448
(But she fails.)

332
00:15:24,318 --> 00:15:25,448
Get out of my way.

333
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:29,948
How did that not go in?

334
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,348
(How on earth did he miss that?)

335
00:15:33,418 --> 00:15:35,218
- You have to run. - Run.

336
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:37,478
(It must be hard to miss like that.)

337
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:40,248
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo misses again.)

338
00:15:42,148 --> 00:15:43,318
- It's in. - He scored.

339
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:46,118
(Seok Jin finally scores a goal.)

340
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:48,248
(No one scored with Gary's football.)

341
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:49,318
- You must be exhausted. - Hey.

342
00:15:50,548 --> 00:15:52,048
(The later the goal was scored, the higher the rank of the ball owner.)

343
00:15:52,148 --> 00:15:54,548
- Thank you for getting up so early. - Okay.

344
00:15:54,648 --> 00:15:55,948
Check what's underneath the cloth.

345
00:15:56,048 --> 00:15:57,378
(Check what's underneath the cloth.)

346
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,148
- There are a bunch of balls. - What is it?

347
00:16:01,478 --> 00:16:04,748
Gary, please take the gym ball.

348
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:06,848
- What? - That must be the best one.

349
00:16:06,948 --> 00:16:08,118
And Ji Hyo, who's in second place...

350
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:10,048
I should have blocked him.

351
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:11,278
Haha, who's in third place,

352
00:16:11,748 --> 00:16:13,748
- gets the football. - I think I got a nice one.

353
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:14,848
Next...

354
00:16:14,948 --> 00:16:16,048
The rugby ball is the worst.

355
00:16:16,148 --> 00:16:17,318
Isn't that the worst one?

356
00:16:17,378 --> 00:16:19,278
Please take the rugby ball.

357
00:16:19,348 --> 00:16:21,548
- This is too... - That's for Jae Seok. Jong Kook,

358
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,348
- Seok Jin and Kwang Soo. - I'm...

359
00:16:24,478 --> 00:16:25,648
- almost last. - What is this?

360
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,318
We'll tell you what to do...

361
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:30,048
with your balls later.

362
00:16:30,048 --> 00:16:32,148
Please keep them with you for now.

363
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:33,478
I wonder what it's for.

364
00:16:34,948 --> 00:16:39,278
(Their busy morning in Shanghai comes to an end.)

365
00:16:40,018 --> 00:16:42,148
- You're right. - We're here.

366
00:16:42,248 --> 00:16:43,748
- We've been here before. - I told you so.

367
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:45,548
- You're right. - This is where we played...

368
00:16:45,548 --> 00:16:47,848
- football with Evra. - That's right. Evra.

369
00:16:47,918 --> 00:16:49,848
Evra was awesome.

370
00:16:49,948 --> 00:16:54,748
(This is where today's match will be held.)

371
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:59,648
(In 2013, they held the Dream Cup here.)

372
00:16:59,748 --> 00:17:04,648
(The players gave their all even in the pouring rain.)

373
00:17:05,048 --> 00:17:08,118
(We still remember the excitement and passion...)

374
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:09,248
(of that day.)

375
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:11,948
It's been such a long time.

376
00:17:12,018 --> 00:17:14,048
- Evra was here. - I remember.

377
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:15,848
- Wow. - This was where it was held.

378
00:17:15,948 --> 00:17:17,948
- I did a tiki-taka over there. - Right.

379
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:19,948
- Hey. - That wasn't a tiki-taka.

380
00:17:20,048 --> 00:17:21,648
- It was a tiki-taka. - Yes.

381
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:22,848
That wasn't a...

382
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,118
- Stop lying. - Jae Seok ran like...

383
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:26,648
this when running.

384
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:28,348
- Good luck today. - Good luck.

385
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,218
Kwang Soo did a header here.

386
00:17:32,278 --> 00:17:33,348
That's right.

387
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:34,548
With this facial expression...

388
00:17:34,848 --> 00:17:35,918
That's the face all...

389
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:37,148
- football players make. - Like a toad.

390
00:17:37,218 --> 00:17:39,148
That's right. A toad. What is this?

391
00:17:39,548 --> 00:17:40,648
(Why is the music playing?)

392
00:17:40,648 --> 00:17:43,048
- What's going on? - What's happening?

393
00:17:43,748 --> 00:17:45,148
(They're running into the stadium.)

394
00:17:45,248 --> 00:17:47,018
- They're cheerleaders. - The cheerleaders.

395
00:17:47,648 --> 00:17:48,848
What's going on?

396
00:17:50,648 --> 00:17:51,948
(Demonstrating kung fu all of a sudden)

397
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:53,748
Is this kung fu?

398
00:17:53,848 --> 00:17:55,048
Wow.

399
00:17:56,648 --> 00:17:58,348
He has a mask on.

400
00:17:58,418 --> 00:17:59,418
(His moves are smooth.)

401
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,548
Right.

402
00:18:00,948 --> 00:18:02,548
(Spreading)

403
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,448
- Wow. - Wow.

404
00:18:07,018 --> 00:18:11,048
(They mixed traditional Chinese dancing with unique costumes.)

405
00:18:11,118 --> 00:18:13,548
(They are amazed by the performance.)

406
00:18:15,518 --> 00:18:17,148
(They hurdle together to make...)

407
00:18:17,218 --> 00:18:18,248
What?

408
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:19,748
They're linked by their sleeves.

409
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,248
It's a football!

410
00:18:21,318 --> 00:18:22,388
(And...)

411
00:18:22,448 --> 00:18:23,448
- Wow. - It's a football!

412
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:27,018
(one performer jumps into the circle.)

413
00:18:27,118 --> 00:18:28,748
(Who is the man behind...)

414
00:18:28,848 --> 00:18:32,318
(the amazing finale of their performance?)

415
00:18:33,318 --> 00:18:34,448
(The hero appears.)

416
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:37,148
(Korea's legendary football player, Park Ji Sung)

417
00:18:38,388 --> 00:18:40,478
(In his numerous appearances in the past,)

418
00:18:40,548 --> 00:18:45,048
(he'd always wanted to make a calm entrance.)

419
00:18:45,148 --> 00:18:47,478
(But today, his entrance was dynamic.)

420
00:18:47,618 --> 00:18:49,248
- Hey. - It's nice to see you.

421
00:18:49,348 --> 00:18:51,418
(Embarrassed)

422
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,648
- What are you doing? - He's embarrassed.

423
00:18:53,748 --> 00:18:55,048
Aren't you embarrassed?

424
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:56,918
(We haven't seen this side of Ji Sung before.)

425
00:18:56,948 --> 00:18:58,218
You've changed a lot, Ji Sung.

426
00:18:58,278 --> 00:19:00,418
Your entrances used to involve smoke before.

427
00:19:00,478 --> 00:19:01,478
Right?

428
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:02,648
- It's been such a long time. - Wow.

429
00:19:02,748 --> 00:19:04,418
(Welcome, Captain.)

430
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,418
- Welcome. - It's been such a long time.

431
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,048
How have you been? Are you still in England?

432
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,648
I landed this morning...

433
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:10,918
- from England. - Is that right?

434
00:19:11,348 --> 00:19:14,448
How old is your baby?

435
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:15,848
She's now 50 days old.

436
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:18,078
- How fascinating! - She's just a newborn.

437
00:19:18,148 --> 00:19:20,248
At that age, the baby is unbelievably lovely.

438
00:19:20,348 --> 00:19:21,818
- But for the parents, - It's tough.

439
00:19:21,888 --> 00:19:23,248
- it's a tough time. - You don't get to sleep.

440
00:19:23,248 --> 00:19:25,448
- He looks gaunt. - Yes.

441
00:19:25,548 --> 00:19:28,548
Now that you have a baby,

442
00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:30,748
your mind-set must have been changed.

443
00:19:31,118 --> 00:19:32,848
- Yes. - How did it change?

444
00:19:32,948 --> 00:19:34,948
Right now, I'm thinking if it's okay for me to have fun here.

445
00:19:35,818 --> 00:19:37,348
- He's anxious. - I understand.

446
00:19:37,448 --> 00:19:39,248
- You're anxious. - So even Ji Sung thinks like that.

447
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:41,148
Oh, gosh.

448
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:42,918
- What's that? - Here.

449
00:19:42,978 --> 00:19:44,648
(Running Man prepared a gift for Captain Park.)

450
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:45,948
- It's... - You're used to it now.

451
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,648
- There are name tags. - There's one for everyone.

452
00:19:48,748 --> 00:19:50,248
(There's a t-shirt for his wife too.)

453
00:19:50,348 --> 00:19:52,818
They're matching shirts!

454
00:19:52,888 --> 00:19:54,148
Congratulations!

455
00:19:54,248 --> 00:19:56,448
(And there's one for Captain Park junior.)

456
00:19:56,518 --> 00:19:58,078
- How adorable!. - It's so cute.

457
00:19:58,148 --> 00:19:59,548
- It's so cute. - So cute.

458
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:00,848
- How cute! - Really.

459
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:02,888
- Her name is Yeon Woo. - Her name is Yeon Woo.

460
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:04,148
- This is it. - Wow.

461
00:20:04,148 --> 00:20:06,348
It's a matching outfit for the family.

462
00:20:06,348 --> 00:20:08,248
- Like this. - So lovely.

463
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,348
You should take a picture and send it to us.

464
00:20:10,448 --> 00:20:13,648
(We will raise Yeon Woo well!)

465
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,748
We played football together many times before.

466
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,448
- So... - So I have invited...

467
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:20,888
two other football players to join us.

468
00:20:20,948 --> 00:20:22,018
- Really? - Really?

469
00:20:22,078 --> 00:20:23,118
Who are they?

470
00:20:23,148 --> 00:20:24,248
Look!

471
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,078
(They are...)

472
00:20:27,218 --> 00:20:28,248
Hello.

473
00:20:28,348 --> 00:20:29,548
Hello!

474
00:20:29,748 --> 00:20:31,448
I know him!

475
00:20:31,548 --> 00:20:33,348
(It's Ji So Yun and Jong Tae Se.)

476
00:20:34,348 --> 00:20:37,118
(Jong Tae Se was the best striker of North Korea.)

477
00:20:37,918 --> 00:20:40,348
(Currently, he's a big-time football player in Japan.)

478
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:44,618
(He's Gary's doppelganger, and he's funny too.)

479
00:20:45,918 --> 00:20:47,348
That's it! Shoot!

480
00:20:47,448 --> 00:20:49,348
(She's a world-class football player from Korea.)

481
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:52,148
(She led Korea to rank number 3 in Female U-20 World Cup.)

482
00:20:52,148 --> 00:20:54,348
(She signed with Chelsea FC and was picked as the Player of 2015.)

483
00:20:54,348 --> 00:20:56,648
- Ji So Yun! - That was an amazing kick.

484
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,248
(They are the two world-class football players.)

485
00:20:59,348 --> 00:21:00,448
Hello.

486
00:21:00,648 --> 00:21:01,888
Hello.

487
00:21:02,518 --> 00:21:03,948
Hello.

488
00:21:04,018 --> 00:21:05,118
Hello!

489
00:21:05,648 --> 00:21:07,448
She's "Ji Messi".

490
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:09,888
- Hello. - Aren't we from the same family?

491
00:21:10,078 --> 00:21:11,148
It's such an honour to meet you.

492
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:12,748
She's the pride of the Ji family.

493
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:14,048
We have Ji So Yun and...

494
00:21:14,118 --> 00:21:15,918
Jong Tae Se here.

495
00:21:15,978 --> 00:21:17,218
I'm so honoured.

496
00:21:17,548 --> 00:21:19,348
I never knew her voice would be so lovely.

497
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:21,448
- I didn't know she was that girl. - I know.

498
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:23,448
Do you watch Running Man?

499
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:24,718
Yes, I watch it often.

500
00:21:25,248 --> 00:21:26,948
- We are honoured. - We really are.

501
00:21:27,018 --> 00:21:28,018
We see you on TV often.

502
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,348
But you invited me too late.

503
00:21:30,648 --> 00:21:31,748
Apologise to her!

504
00:21:32,518 --> 00:21:34,848
- We are sorry. - We thought you were abroad.

505
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,248
It's been such a long time since Tae Se was last here.

506
00:21:37,248 --> 00:21:38,348
- Yes. - I know.

507
00:21:38,448 --> 00:21:40,148
How long have you been married?

508
00:21:40,148 --> 00:21:41,248
- About two years. - I see.

509
00:21:41,348 --> 00:21:42,648
How's your marriage?

510
00:21:42,748 --> 00:21:44,348
It's the best.

511
00:21:44,448 --> 00:21:47,218
A lot of people say marriage is like digging your own grave.

512
00:21:47,248 --> 00:21:48,918
(This is the guy who said it.)

513
00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:50,548
I know.

514
00:21:50,618 --> 00:21:52,748
Why are you looking at me?

515
00:21:53,448 --> 00:21:55,248
- Hello. - Hey.

516
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:59,248
But I want people to know that being married makes you happy.

517
00:21:59,348 --> 00:22:00,348
Is that right?

518
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,118
- How about you, Ji Sung? - Of course I am happy too.

519
00:22:03,018 --> 00:22:05,248
(Of course I am happy too.)

520
00:22:05,548 --> 00:22:07,048
- Hey! - That was a perfect answer.

521
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,448
- It didn't sound sincere. - You were getting ready to say it.

522
00:22:08,548 --> 00:22:11,348
You didn't sound so sincere.

523
00:22:11,448 --> 00:22:13,548
- You meant it, right? - Yes.

524
00:22:13,618 --> 00:22:14,648
(I am very happy.)

525
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:17,048
Today's race is called Running Man Champions League.

526
00:22:18,248 --> 00:22:22,248
You'll be divided into Team Ji Sung, Team Tae Se and Team So Yun.

527
00:22:22,348 --> 00:22:24,078
- Three teams? - Really?

528
00:22:24,148 --> 00:22:25,348
- Really? - Let's do a tiki-taka.

529
00:22:25,448 --> 00:22:26,918
So...

530
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:30,148
the balls you got as soon as you got up...

531
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,648
- No way. - Now, the three team leaders...

532
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,148
will knock down the ball that belongs to the person they want.

533
00:22:36,248 --> 00:22:37,618
- Really? - Yes!

534
00:22:37,978 --> 00:22:40,148
- Now... - So Gary has a good chance.

535
00:22:40,248 --> 00:22:42,648
You can each take two members.

536
00:22:42,718 --> 00:22:43,818
You can pick whichever ball you want.

537
00:22:43,878 --> 00:22:45,618
- Kwang Soo's is a baseball. - Why did I get a baseball?

538
00:22:45,648 --> 00:22:49,518
If your team members score a goal...

539
00:22:50,048 --> 00:22:51,348
or if they assist the goal,

540
00:22:51,448 --> 00:22:53,918
- then you will get points. - If you help attack...

541
00:22:53,978 --> 00:22:55,618
They are both strikers.

542
00:22:55,648 --> 00:22:57,218
- I know. - They are both strikers.

543
00:22:57,248 --> 00:22:59,348
- Right. - You need a winger!

544
00:22:59,618 --> 00:23:01,248
- Ji Sung will go first. - Come on.

545
00:23:01,248 --> 00:23:02,648
- Ji Sung! - Ji Sung!

546
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:03,748
- I won't say anything. - It's world-class.

547
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:05,148
- I think he will hit it. - Cheers!

548
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:06,348
I think he will hit it.

549
00:23:06,348 --> 00:23:08,078
- I think he will hit it. - Let's go, Ji Sung!

550
00:23:08,148 --> 00:23:09,518
- Just hit one. - That's it.

551
00:23:09,548 --> 00:23:10,848
- All right! - It has to be Jong Kook and me.

552
00:23:12,748 --> 00:23:17,348
(Who will be Captain Park's first choice?)

553
00:23:18,448 --> 00:23:19,448
(It hits Jae Seok's ball.)

554
00:23:20,348 --> 00:23:22,448
(He hit Jae Seok's rugby ball.)

555
00:23:22,518 --> 00:23:24,348
Nice shot!

556
00:23:24,848 --> 00:23:26,248
He's even good at throwing his shoe.

557
00:23:26,718 --> 00:23:27,818
He's good at this too.

558
00:23:28,248 --> 00:23:29,548
That was nice.

559
00:23:29,648 --> 00:23:31,248
- It's not easy. - So Yun is next.

560
00:23:31,348 --> 00:23:32,818
- Go, So Yun! - The risk is...

561
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,018
- Just go easy and hit mine. - too big.

562
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:37,218
You need someone to assist you.

563
00:23:37,448 --> 00:23:38,848
- I think she can hit it. - Gary's ball is the biggest.

564
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,348
- Gary plays football well. - What if I hit Seok Jin's?

565
00:23:41,348 --> 00:23:42,548
(What if I hit Seok Jin's?)

566
00:23:42,918 --> 00:23:44,118
What if?

567
00:23:44,878 --> 00:23:46,048
Don't think about the worst case scenario.

568
00:23:46,118 --> 00:23:47,118
So Yun!

569
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,918
Did you say what if you hit mine?

570
00:23:50,348 --> 00:23:51,748
The risk is too high.

571
00:23:52,448 --> 00:23:54,048
(Which one will she choose?)

572
00:23:54,118 --> 00:23:55,248
Please!

573
00:23:57,048 --> 00:23:59,018
(She chooses Gary.)

574
00:23:59,078 --> 00:24:01,118
(With a powerful shoot, she hits Gary's ball.)

575
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,148
That was amazing.

576
00:24:03,348 --> 00:24:04,448
Gary!

577
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:06,048
Yes! Yes!

578
00:24:06,148 --> 00:24:07,618
- Next up is Tae Se. - Tae Se!

579
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:10,648
Because I played with you last time, I know who plays well.

580
00:24:10,748 --> 00:24:11,848
- Right! - Right!

581
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:13,348
- He knows. - Then it's...

582
00:24:13,448 --> 00:24:15,548
- I will only target one ball. - Jong Kook.

583
00:24:15,648 --> 00:24:17,748
- It must be Jong Kook. - I knew it.

584
00:24:17,848 --> 00:24:20,048
Maybe he will accidentally hit Seok Jin's?

585
00:24:20,078 --> 00:24:21,748
(She's worried for him.)

586
00:24:21,818 --> 00:24:22,948
That would be the worst.

587
00:24:23,018 --> 00:24:24,648
(That would be the worst.)

588
00:24:24,748 --> 00:24:25,848
The worst?

589
00:24:26,078 --> 00:24:27,218
- The worst. - How could you say that?

590
00:24:27,218 --> 00:24:28,548
It will be the worst.

591
00:24:28,618 --> 00:24:30,978
I mean marriage is the worst. I mean we're in the same situation.

592
00:24:31,048 --> 00:24:32,078
Marriage is the worst.

593
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:34,748
It's very near.

594
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:37,648
Yes!

595
00:24:37,748 --> 00:24:38,748
(Tae Se chooses Jong Kook.)

596
00:24:38,848 --> 00:24:40,518
(They precisely hit the ball they target!)

597
00:24:40,548 --> 00:24:42,248
- That's okay? - Okay.

598
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:43,848
(Tae Se and Jong Kook make the most powerful team.)

599
00:24:43,918 --> 00:24:45,748
- Go! go! - Which one should I go for?

600
00:24:47,348 --> 00:24:48,448
- Seok Jin's. - Kwang Soo's.

601
00:24:48,548 --> 00:24:49,818
- When it comes to football... - Kwang Soo's.

602
00:24:49,878 --> 00:24:51,148
- Awesome. - Yes.

603
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:52,878
- I don't know yet. - You're going for Seok Jin?

604
00:24:52,948 --> 00:24:54,248
I'm a fellow married man.

605
00:24:54,248 --> 00:24:56,248
Right. You're right.

606
00:24:56,548 --> 00:24:58,118
You can't get him. You can't get Seok Jin.

607
00:24:58,548 --> 00:25:03,148
(Will Tae Se really choose Seok Jin?)

608
00:25:04,648 --> 00:25:06,848
(He chooses Kwang Soo.)

609
00:25:06,948 --> 00:25:08,148
He didn't choose Seok Jin.

610
00:25:08,248 --> 00:25:09,648
- Yes! - He didn't choose Seok Jin.

611
00:25:09,748 --> 00:25:11,618
(Winning is more important to Tae Se.)

612
00:25:11,818 --> 00:25:12,918
We are all set.

613
00:25:13,148 --> 00:25:15,448
(Tae Se chooses Jong Kook and Kwang Soo.)

614
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:16,748
All right.

615
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:18,648
- You know it. - We're in trouble.

616
00:25:19,348 --> 00:25:20,978
Ji Sung, come on.

617
00:25:21,248 --> 00:25:22,818
I'm trying to hit the ball.

618
00:25:23,448 --> 00:25:24,548
(He kicks the football.)

619
00:25:25,918 --> 00:25:28,848
(He precisely hits Haha's ball.)

620
00:25:28,918 --> 00:25:30,748
- I chose you. - Yes!

621
00:25:31,118 --> 00:25:32,748
- Gosh... - You're my partner.

622
00:25:33,878 --> 00:25:35,978
(Ji Sung chooses Jae Seok and Haha.)

623
00:25:36,348 --> 00:25:38,548
- Who's left now? - Ji Hyo and Seok Jin.

624
00:25:39,348 --> 00:25:40,548
- Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo.

625
00:25:40,618 --> 00:25:41,818
- Pick me! - I will make you a couple.

626
00:25:42,078 --> 00:25:43,618
She's going to make them a couple.

627
00:25:43,648 --> 00:25:45,048
(Will Ji Hyo and Gary become a couple again?)

628
00:25:45,248 --> 00:25:46,448
Go!

629
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,118
Okay!

630
00:25:48,718 --> 00:25:49,878
(She precisely hits Ji Hyo's ball.)

631
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,848
You did it!

632
00:25:52,748 --> 00:25:54,948
(So Yun chooses Gary and Ji Hyo.)

633
00:25:55,018 --> 00:25:57,748
- All right. - I waited for you.

634
00:25:57,818 --> 00:25:59,448
Jong Tae Se!

635
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:00,518
- Jong Tae Se! - Jong Tae Se!

636
00:26:00,548 --> 00:26:01,848
- Let's go now. - Jong Tae Se!

637
00:26:01,918 --> 00:26:03,548
- Let's go now. - You almost got hit.

638
00:26:03,548 --> 00:26:05,148
(The teams are formed.)

639
00:26:05,818 --> 00:26:08,048
(They go to the locker room to change into uniforms.)

640
00:26:08,148 --> 00:26:10,048
It's the same place.

641
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,148
(They came here for the 2013 Dream Cup, so they're used to the place.)

642
00:26:11,248 --> 00:26:12,348
- This is the place. - This is the place.

643
00:26:12,348 --> 00:26:13,718
- The massage place... - It's here.

644
00:26:14,148 --> 00:26:17,048
(Someone's inside?)

645
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:20,548
(It is...)

646
00:26:21,018 --> 00:26:23,048
(Song Joong Ki, Running Man's family.)

647
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,348
I almost died.

648
00:26:24,448 --> 00:26:25,648
Joong Ki!

649
00:26:26,548 --> 00:26:28,078
Hey, Joong Ki.

650
00:26:28,148 --> 00:26:29,448
(They are always happy to see Joong Ki.)

651
00:26:30,348 --> 00:26:31,518
Oh, dear!

652
00:26:32,348 --> 00:26:33,448
(Joong Ki is here.)

653
00:26:33,548 --> 00:26:34,848
Joong Ki!

654
00:26:35,018 --> 00:26:36,348
You're here!

655
00:26:37,848 --> 00:26:38,978
Hello!

656
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:43,248
It's been such a long time, Joong Ki.

657
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,118
- Joong Ki. - I missed you.

658
00:26:45,148 --> 00:26:46,918
Happy New Year.

659
00:26:46,978 --> 00:26:50,448
(I missed you, my family.)

660
00:26:52,618 --> 00:26:58,448
(They are happier to see him in Shanghai.)

661
00:26:58,518 --> 00:27:01,348
(Family is the best!)

662
00:27:03,078 --> 00:27:04,618
I got this, Seok Jin.

663
00:27:04,648 --> 00:27:05,718
7012.

664
00:27:05,748 --> 00:27:07,018
- Hey! - That's sweet.

665
00:27:07,078 --> 00:27:08,248
- What's wrong with you? - Don't do this.

666
00:27:08,248 --> 00:27:10,348
(Seven Running Man members together forever)

667
00:27:10,348 --> 00:27:11,848
It's too cheesy!

668
00:27:12,348 --> 00:27:13,648
- Gosh. - Gosh.

669
00:27:13,748 --> 00:27:14,748
Goodness.

670
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:16,548
We might get injured while warming up.

671
00:27:16,648 --> 00:27:19,018
This is good for you. It's red ginseng extract.

672
00:27:19,078 --> 00:27:20,248
(Drinking the ginseng extract to get over the nervousness)

673
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:21,548
- Red ginseng! - Red ginseng!

674
00:27:21,618 --> 00:27:25,848
(Will we be able to score a goal today?)

675
00:27:26,748 --> 00:27:29,878
(As time passes, they get nervous.)

676
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:30,948
Let's go.

677
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:32,818
- I've been waiting for this time. - It has begun.

678
00:27:32,878 --> 00:27:34,018
I've been waiting for this time.

679
00:27:34,078 --> 00:27:35,878
(It's time to go meet their teammates in the next room.)

680
00:27:37,648 --> 00:27:38,718
- Hello. - Hello.

681
00:27:38,748 --> 00:27:40,848
(Hello)

682
00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:42,248
(Welcome)

683
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:43,878
Why are you here?

684
00:27:43,878 --> 00:27:45,348
(Kim Dong Jin, Lee Chung Sung, and Lee Dong Gook are here.)

685
00:27:45,348 --> 00:27:46,518
Please help us a lot.

686
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:47,648
Wow.

687
00:27:48,518 --> 00:27:50,348
(Look who's here!)

688
00:27:50,448 --> 00:27:51,548
Dong Gook.

689
00:27:51,848 --> 00:27:53,348
You're on the other show that's aired at the same time as this.

690
00:27:54,078 --> 00:27:55,978
Is it okay for you to be on this show?

691
00:27:56,518 --> 00:27:58,878
You're here for the charity football event.

692
00:27:58,948 --> 00:28:00,918
Yes, you are right.

693
00:28:01,078 --> 00:28:02,348
(Your babies are doing well, right?)

694
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:03,748
I was afraid it would be a problem.

695
00:28:04,748 --> 00:28:09,248
He's Patrick Kluivert from the Netherlands.

696
00:28:09,548 --> 00:28:11,878
And he's Gianluca Zambrotta from Italy.

697
00:28:12,348 --> 00:28:14,048
Il Woo's here as well, and...

698
00:28:14,948 --> 00:28:16,718
Joong Ki, too.

699
00:28:16,748 --> 00:28:18,548
- Joong Ki. - Yes.

700
00:28:18,648 --> 00:28:19,818
He's like our member.

701
00:28:19,878 --> 00:28:20,878
He's one of us.

702
00:28:20,948 --> 00:28:25,348
We are very honoured to play with amazing players.

703
00:28:25,448 --> 00:28:27,218
Thank you.

704
00:28:27,348 --> 00:28:28,648
He's famous too.

705
00:28:28,718 --> 00:28:30,078
He's Lee Chung Sung.

706
00:28:30,148 --> 00:28:33,148
(He's the director of Korean All Star team.)

707
00:28:34,118 --> 00:28:36,648
(Choi Kang Hee, the renowned football director in Korea)

708
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,078
- Hello, Sir! - Hello, Sir!

709
00:28:38,748 --> 00:28:39,948
- Seok Jin is here. - Sir!

710
00:28:40,048 --> 00:28:41,648
- Hello, Sir! - Happy New Year, Sir!

711
00:28:41,718 --> 00:28:42,948
We wish you good health.

712
00:28:43,018 --> 00:28:44,978
(They all bow to the director.)

713
00:28:45,048 --> 00:28:47,348
- Don't overdo it. - Attacking is the only way to go.

714
00:28:47,948 --> 00:28:49,348
Jae Seok and Kwang Soo...

715
00:28:50,078 --> 00:28:51,718
play football with their mouths.

716
00:28:51,748 --> 00:28:52,818
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo play football with their mouths.)

717
00:28:53,018 --> 00:28:55,148
So you will be divided into three teams.

718
00:28:55,248 --> 00:29:02,518
Team Ji Sung, Team So Yun and Team Tae Se.

719
00:29:02,518 --> 00:29:05,448
But you shouldn't pass the ball...

720
00:29:05,548 --> 00:29:07,878
only to your teammates. Don't be like that.

721
00:29:07,978 --> 00:29:08,978
(All three teams should do their best to win.)

722
00:29:09,078 --> 00:29:11,378
Coach Kim will call your names.

723
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:12,778
Get ready.

724
00:29:13,078 --> 00:29:14,318
Team Ji Sung will have...

725
00:29:14,578 --> 00:29:17,948
Park Ji Sung, Yu Jae Seok, Haha, Han Kook Young, Lee Dong Gook,

726
00:29:17,978 --> 00:29:20,148
Song Joong Ki, Kim Dong Jin, Zambrotta and Kim Se Joon.

727
00:29:20,178 --> 00:29:21,878
- That's amazing. - That's a great lineup.

728
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:24,248
That's amazing.

729
00:29:24,318 --> 00:29:25,378
Team So Yun will have...

730
00:29:25,678 --> 00:29:28,678
Ji So Yun, Song Ji Hyo, Kluivert, Lee Chung Sung, Jang Hyun Soo,

731
00:29:28,678 --> 00:29:31,978
Gary, Jung Il Woo, Kim Jae Sung and Kim Byung Ji.

732
00:29:32,478 --> 00:29:34,678
(They are very confident.)

733
00:29:35,378 --> 00:29:36,548
Team Tae Se will have...

734
00:29:36,878 --> 00:29:40,048
Jong Tae Se, Kim Jong Kook, Lee Kwang Soo, Jee Seok Jin,

735
00:29:40,048 --> 00:29:41,948
Lee Chun Soo, Han Sang In, Kim Tae Ryoong,

736
00:29:41,978 --> 00:29:43,978
Park Chan Yong and Park Hyung In.

737
00:29:44,678 --> 00:29:46,678
- That's great. - We have Chun Soo.

738
00:29:46,948 --> 00:29:49,078
- Get together with your teams. - Okay.

739
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:52,548
- Plan your strategies for a minute. - Okay.

740
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:55,678
Let's take a picture together.

741
00:29:57,178 --> 00:29:58,178
Here I go.

742
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:02,348
(Team Tae Se wants to have the MVP from their team.)

743
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:04,318
Let's get together.

744
00:30:04,378 --> 00:30:06,678
(Team Ji Sung takes a group picture.)

745
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:07,878
Okay.

746
00:30:07,948 --> 00:30:10,248
(They're ready to take a picture.)

747
00:30:10,778 --> 00:30:12,178
Here we go.

748
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:15,778
(Team Ji Sung wants to score three points each.)

749
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:18,778
Are you all ready?

750
00:30:18,778 --> 00:30:20,678
- Yes. - Let's do a cheer.

751
00:30:20,678 --> 00:30:23,278
(It's time to go and play football.)

752
00:30:24,578 --> 00:30:28,148
- Let's go! - Let's go!

753
00:30:28,178 --> 00:30:29,178
(Good luck, everyone!)

754
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:31,348
(Let's win this game!)

755
00:30:32,778 --> 00:30:35,078
(It's time...)

756
00:30:35,148 --> 00:30:37,518
(for the big match.)

757
00:30:39,318 --> 00:30:40,418
(Running Man Champions League in Hongkou Stadium)

758
00:30:40,478 --> 00:30:42,248
Hi, this is your sports caster Bae Sung Jae.

759
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:44,578
The 2016 Running Man Champions League...

760
00:30:44,578 --> 00:30:48,678
is being held in Hongkou Stadium in Shanghai.

761
00:30:48,778 --> 00:30:50,348
Park Moon Sung commentator is here.

762
00:30:50,418 --> 00:30:51,678
- Hi. - Hello.

763
00:30:51,778 --> 00:30:54,518
The 2016 Asian Smile Cup in China...

764
00:30:54,578 --> 00:30:57,318
is the first half of the Running Man Champions League.

765
00:30:57,478 --> 00:30:59,948
There is a final mission for the second half.

766
00:31:00,048 --> 00:31:01,348
Korean players are entering the stadium.

767
00:31:01,418 --> 00:31:04,048
- Dong Gook and Chung Sung are here. - Yes.

768
00:31:04,078 --> 00:31:06,948
Patrick Kluivert from the Netherlands and...

769
00:31:07,378 --> 00:31:08,978
Gianluca Zambrotta from Italy are here too.

770
00:31:09,048 --> 00:31:10,878
Ji So Yun, Jong Tae Se and...

771
00:31:10,948 --> 00:31:12,978
Running Man members are here too.

772
00:31:13,078 --> 00:31:15,418
They seem uneasy.

773
00:31:15,478 --> 00:31:19,178
I believe they are very nervous.

774
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:20,578
(Please smile, Running Man members.)

775
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:23,578
There are a lot of fans in the stadium.

776
00:31:23,978 --> 00:31:27,778
Today's game will be Chinese All Stars...

777
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:30,148
versus Korean All Stars.

778
00:31:30,178 --> 00:31:34,048
Korean All Stars are divided into Team Ji Sung, Team So Yun...

779
00:31:34,078 --> 00:31:36,978
- and Team Tae Se. - Yes.

780
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:40,178
When a player scores,

781
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:42,578
assists or blocks a goal,

782
00:31:42,678 --> 00:31:44,348
- the team will get points. - I see.

783
00:31:44,418 --> 00:31:46,518
The points they earn will be used...

784
00:31:46,648 --> 00:31:49,318
- in the final mission. - I see.

785
00:31:50,078 --> 00:31:53,178
Their director is Choi Kang Hee,

786
00:31:53,348 --> 00:31:55,178
and Kim Tae Young is their coach.

787
00:31:56,178 --> 00:31:57,178
(Bumping)

788
00:31:58,678 --> 00:32:00,178
(What was that?)

789
00:32:00,778 --> 00:32:02,518
I think Jong Kook is very nervous.

790
00:32:03,178 --> 00:32:05,348
Ji Sung looks very excited.

791
00:32:05,418 --> 00:32:08,578
Ji Sung and Byung Ji are on the field together.

792
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:10,048
Yes.

793
00:32:10,048 --> 00:32:11,778
- They look excited. - Yes.

794
00:32:11,878 --> 00:32:13,678
(Jong Kook and Kwang Soo got chosen as substitutes.)

795
00:32:14,078 --> 00:32:15,878
- Yes, Sir! - Do well.

796
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:17,378
You'll be up soon.

797
00:32:18,078 --> 00:32:19,518
(I'm so nervous.)

798
00:32:19,578 --> 00:32:20,978
(Get ready.)

799
00:32:22,948 --> 00:32:25,978
It's important to win against the Chinese team.

800
00:32:26,148 --> 00:32:29,048
But how each member of these three teams,

801
00:32:29,078 --> 00:32:32,248
Team Ji Sung, Team So Yun and Team Tae Se,

802
00:32:32,378 --> 00:32:35,278
do a good job and earn points will also be looked forward to.

803
00:32:35,348 --> 00:32:37,578
(Team Ji Sung, Team So Yun and Team Tae Se)

804
00:32:40,078 --> 00:32:43,778
The Chinese team is on the right wearing green uniform.

805
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,048
- It started. - The Korean team is on the left...

806
00:32:46,078 --> 00:32:47,348
- wearing white uniform. - I'm so nervous.

807
00:32:47,678 --> 00:32:48,678
What shall I do?

808
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:50,978
Players sitting on the bench...

809
00:32:51,318 --> 00:32:52,978
- look more like spectators. - Yes.

810
00:32:53,048 --> 00:32:56,248
- They are here to watch the game. - Yes.

811
00:32:56,318 --> 00:32:58,778
The ball is snatched in the middle and then passed.

812
00:32:58,948 --> 00:33:01,318
Han Kook Young is dribbling the ball.

813
00:33:01,378 --> 00:33:02,878
Kluivert stops the ball.

814
00:33:03,578 --> 00:33:04,948
Ji Sung!

815
00:33:05,948 --> 00:33:07,078
Ji Sung, my friend!

816
00:33:07,178 --> 00:33:08,548
- He's cheering. - Yes.

817
00:33:08,578 --> 00:33:10,878
Why is he screaming now?

818
00:33:10,978 --> 00:33:12,678
Ji Sung runs to the right side.

819
00:33:12,778 --> 00:33:15,278
He passes it to Dong Gook,

820
00:33:15,348 --> 00:33:17,678
- but gets intercepted. - Looking after the baby...

821
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:18,878
- must have had an effect. - Yes.

822
00:33:18,978 --> 00:33:21,448
Ji Sung is just getting warmed up.

823
00:33:21,518 --> 00:33:23,048
He didn't have time to practise.

824
00:33:23,478 --> 00:33:25,678
He seemed to have lost weight.

825
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,548
He just flew from London. He must be jet lagged.

826
00:33:27,578 --> 00:33:28,678
- Yes. - He must be tired.

827
00:33:28,778 --> 00:33:30,348
Ji Sung's wife seemed to have...

828
00:33:30,418 --> 00:33:33,178
gained weight after having a baby,

829
00:33:33,318 --> 00:33:35,318
but Ji Sung lost a lot of weight.

830
00:33:35,578 --> 00:33:37,578
- That's funny. - They're running.

831
00:33:37,578 --> 00:33:38,948
They are going in.

832
00:33:40,078 --> 00:33:41,518
(There's an open space.)

833
00:33:41,578 --> 00:33:43,178
They need defence.

834
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:44,448
He passes it.

835
00:33:44,518 --> 00:33:46,648
They need to block it.

836
00:33:47,148 --> 00:33:49,518
- That was a good pass. - It's going across.

837
00:33:50,478 --> 00:33:54,178
- He gets it out. - All the Chinese players are...

838
00:33:54,548 --> 00:33:56,778
former or current national football players.

839
00:33:56,878 --> 00:33:59,248
- Yes. - Some players seem to be...

840
00:33:59,318 --> 00:34:01,078
- moving a bit slow. - Yes.

841
00:34:01,778 --> 00:34:03,078
The ball is in the middle.

842
00:34:03,578 --> 00:34:06,578
The ball gets passed and he shoots!

843
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,288
(The Chinese team shoots.)

844
00:34:09,788 --> 00:34:10,788
It's their first shoot.

845
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,318
He's the former midfielder of...

846
00:34:12,578 --> 00:34:13,578
the Chinese national football team.

847
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:15,378
(Will it...)

848
00:34:15,448 --> 00:34:16,788
(go in?)

849
00:34:17,178 --> 00:34:20,418
He shoots the ball! It's the first shoot.

850
00:34:20,478 --> 00:34:23,518
Kim Byung Ji blocks the ball.

851
00:34:23,578 --> 00:34:25,478
(Kim Byung Ji blocks a goal.)

852
00:34:25,548 --> 00:34:28,248
He's a great Chinese midfielder.

853
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:29,348
He blocked a goal.

854
00:34:29,678 --> 00:34:31,148
- He blocked a goal. - Yes!

855
00:34:31,178 --> 00:34:32,178
He blocked a goal.

856
00:34:32,288 --> 00:34:33,318
He caught it.

857
00:34:34,378 --> 00:34:35,878
- Look at him. - He's so good.

858
00:34:36,288 --> 00:34:37,288
The game just started.

859
00:34:37,348 --> 00:34:39,348
I think we have a chance today.

860
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,348
- Don't we? - What?

861
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:46,448
- Yes. - The Running Man teams need to...

862
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:47,788
score points for the second half.

863
00:34:47,788 --> 00:34:50,048
- Ji Sung passes the ball. - Great.

864
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:51,248
Chun Soo shoots!

865
00:34:51,318 --> 00:34:52,318
It didn't go in.

866
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:55,788
They both played in the 2002 World Cup.

867
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:58,788
Right. Both of them still...

868
00:34:58,878 --> 00:35:00,578
- play very well. - Yes.

869
00:35:00,948 --> 00:35:03,788
Chun Soo retired not too long ago,

870
00:35:03,788 --> 00:35:06,648
- didn't he? - Ji Sung's uniform seems too big.

871
00:35:07,578 --> 00:35:08,978
- He lost weight. - The ball gets passed.

872
00:35:09,078 --> 00:35:11,148
Kook Young receives the ball.

873
00:35:11,348 --> 00:35:12,478
And he passes it.

874
00:35:12,548 --> 00:35:14,048
He goes to the other side.

875
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:15,378
(Over here!)

876
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:16,878
He passes it to Ji Sung.

877
00:35:16,978 --> 00:35:18,378
Ji Sung falls down.

878
00:35:18,788 --> 00:35:21,078
Was he this weak?

879
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,878
(What just happened?)

880
00:35:23,948 --> 00:35:27,248
I don't think he has been eating too well...

881
00:35:27,578 --> 00:35:29,788
- in England. - Ji Sung actually scored...

882
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:31,978
- on the same spot in 2002. - Right.

883
00:35:32,288 --> 00:35:33,978
- That's too bad. - It was close.

884
00:35:34,248 --> 00:35:35,348
(Ji Sung runs fast.)

885
00:35:36,648 --> 00:35:38,448
I hope Ji Sung does better.

886
00:35:38,518 --> 00:35:39,788
The players fight for the ball.

887
00:35:39,878 --> 00:35:41,318
That was good defence by Ji Sung.

888
00:35:41,378 --> 00:35:43,978
He's good at defence.

889
00:35:44,178 --> 00:35:45,418
That's great.

890
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:47,248
He turns around.

891
00:35:47,318 --> 00:35:48,448
That was good.

892
00:35:48,978 --> 00:35:50,288
You shouldn't make him angry.

893
00:35:50,578 --> 00:35:51,948
He's really something.

894
00:35:53,788 --> 00:35:55,678
(Ji Sung intercepts and runs with the ball.)

895
00:35:57,678 --> 00:35:59,678
Jae Sung receives the ball.

896
00:35:59,878 --> 00:36:01,678
Ji Sung runs to the right.

897
00:36:01,788 --> 00:36:02,788
He's using his left foot.

898
00:36:02,878 --> 00:36:04,978
He shoots with his left foot.

899
00:36:06,678 --> 00:36:08,678
When he was playing for Manchester United in the past,

900
00:36:08,788 --> 00:36:10,788
he once scored a goal beautifully at the end of the game.

901
00:36:11,178 --> 00:36:12,378
This is the same spot.

902
00:36:12,448 --> 00:36:13,478
That's right.

903
00:36:13,548 --> 00:36:16,678
That reminded me of the time...

904
00:36:16,678 --> 00:36:18,578
when Ji Sung played for Manchester United.

905
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:19,788
It was similar. It happened in the same zone.

906
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:20,878
Let's see if he'll do it again.

907
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:22,518
He runs to the side.

908
00:36:22,788 --> 00:36:24,678
He shoots with his left foot.

909
00:36:24,878 --> 00:36:25,878
The ball veers left.

910
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:29,078
(Will it...)

911
00:36:29,178 --> 00:36:30,248
(go in?)

912
00:36:31,478 --> 00:36:34,178
(The ball veers left...)

913
00:36:34,248 --> 00:36:35,248
(and doesn't go in.)

914
00:36:35,788 --> 00:36:38,518
- Too bad. - It didn't go in.

915
00:36:38,788 --> 00:36:40,418
It's okay.

916
00:36:40,578 --> 00:36:41,678
He's good.

917
00:36:42,978 --> 00:36:44,078
He's still good.

918
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:45,878
(He still plays well.)

919
00:36:47,378 --> 00:36:50,078
Ji Sung moves faster now than...

920
00:36:50,148 --> 00:36:51,788
- the beginning. - Yes.

921
00:36:51,788 --> 00:36:54,418
It's Zambrotta.

922
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:57,248
He looks at Ji Sung and passes the ball to him.

923
00:36:58,148 --> 00:36:59,248
He passes the ball...

924
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:01,248
but the pass was too short.

925
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:03,248
- Wait. - What?

926
00:37:03,448 --> 00:37:04,978
(What?)

927
00:37:06,788 --> 00:37:08,378
(Patrick Kluivert, the legendary Dutch football player)

928
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:10,178
Kluivert received the ball!

929
00:37:12,288 --> 00:37:13,678
It went in the wrong direction.

930
00:37:13,788 --> 00:37:15,518
But that was...

931
00:37:15,578 --> 00:37:18,288
a great play between the two world-class players.

932
00:37:18,348 --> 00:37:20,788
Zambrotta and Kluivert made a great move.

933
00:37:20,978 --> 00:37:22,148
That was wonderful.

934
00:37:22,178 --> 00:37:23,248
I agree.

935
00:37:23,318 --> 00:37:25,148
You're my hero!

936
00:37:25,148 --> 00:37:26,578
(You're my hero!)

937
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,788
Don't lie. You don't even know who Kluivert is.

938
00:37:29,148 --> 00:37:30,878
Come on.

939
00:37:30,978 --> 00:37:33,448
- Hey, Kwang Soo. - Look over there.

940
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:34,518
Right.

941
00:37:34,578 --> 00:37:36,288
That's a tiny gap.

942
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:39,518
No one would be able to tell that they're retired.

943
00:37:39,578 --> 00:37:41,788
- They're good. - You never even knew them before.

944
00:37:41,788 --> 00:37:43,318
(You never even knew them before.)

945
00:37:43,318 --> 00:37:44,318
(Everyone pretends to know much about football.)

946
00:37:44,378 --> 00:37:46,648
Come on. Stop lying.

947
00:37:47,048 --> 00:37:48,978
(I wish I knew him in person.)

948
00:37:49,578 --> 00:37:50,978
When I was a student,

949
00:37:51,078 --> 00:37:53,288
I couldn't afford fan jerseys.

950
00:37:53,348 --> 00:37:55,878
But I managed to buy...

951
00:37:55,948 --> 00:37:57,078
- Kluivert's jersey. - I see.

952
00:37:57,518 --> 00:37:59,348
That was the only one I bought.

953
00:37:59,678 --> 00:38:01,548
Tae Se likes him a lot.

954
00:38:01,578 --> 00:38:02,578
(Kluivert is Tae Se's favourite player.)

955
00:38:03,078 --> 00:38:05,078
How can they know if it will be an offside?

956
00:38:05,148 --> 00:38:06,378
Exactly.

957
00:38:06,788 --> 00:38:07,978
Can we get rid of offside?

958
00:38:09,148 --> 00:38:10,478
That's no fun.

959
00:38:10,548 --> 00:38:11,978
I am talking...

960
00:38:12,048 --> 00:38:14,448
about that boxed lines.

961
00:38:14,978 --> 00:38:17,178
It feels great to go through an offside.

962
00:38:17,418 --> 00:38:19,418
(Jong Kook talks as if he's a great player.)

963
00:38:20,788 --> 00:38:22,348
Go, go!

964
00:38:22,418 --> 00:38:24,518
- Ji So Yun. - She passes the ball.

965
00:38:24,578 --> 00:38:26,148
Jong Kook's in the field.

966
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:27,578
He's running.

967
00:38:27,678 --> 00:38:28,678
So Yun passes.

968
00:38:28,788 --> 00:38:30,318
Jong Kook gets a chance.

969
00:38:30,378 --> 00:38:32,318
He faces the goalkeeper.

970
00:38:32,378 --> 00:38:34,978
He can't lose this chance.

971
00:38:35,078 --> 00:38:36,678
(Will he score?)

972
00:38:37,978 --> 00:38:39,078
The ball should have been theirs.

973
00:38:39,788 --> 00:38:41,178
Why don't you go in and play yourself?

974
00:38:46,648 --> 00:38:48,518
Ji Sung receives the ball.

975
00:38:48,578 --> 00:38:51,378
We see him dribbling the ball in the centre.

976
00:38:51,448 --> 00:38:53,048
- It's great. - That's a good pass.

977
00:38:53,078 --> 00:38:55,878
Chun Soo receives the ball.

978
00:38:56,178 --> 00:38:57,288
He shoots with the right foot.

979
00:38:57,348 --> 00:38:58,518
The ball drops.

980
00:38:58,788 --> 00:39:01,248
(Will he score a goal?)

981
00:39:01,878 --> 00:39:05,788
Kluivert shoots!

982
00:39:05,978 --> 00:39:08,288
(Will he be able to score a goal?)

983
00:39:09,918 --> 00:39:11,378
The ball drops. He shoots with the right foot.

984
00:39:11,578 --> 00:39:13,788
Kluivert!

985
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,318
(Kluivert scores a goal.)

986
00:39:16,418 --> 00:39:18,318
He makes the first goal.

987
00:39:18,748 --> 00:39:20,848
He is an exceptional striker.

988
00:39:20,918 --> 00:39:23,118
It was a difficult pass to receive.

989
00:39:23,118 --> 00:39:25,218
Yes, he scored the goal.

990
00:39:25,318 --> 00:39:27,378
Kluivert made a goal.

991
00:39:27,418 --> 00:39:30,048
With Chung Sung's assist, it seems that Team So Yun...

992
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,678
will receive two points.

993
00:39:31,748 --> 00:39:35,318
Team So Yun leads with two points.

994
00:39:35,378 --> 00:39:36,378
Well done!

995
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:38,918
(Kluivert scores with Chung Sung's assist, earning two points.)

996
00:39:39,018 --> 00:39:41,878
Ji Sung should have scored a goal.

997
00:39:41,948 --> 00:39:43,018
Go team!

998
00:39:44,478 --> 00:39:47,518
Running Man members look cold. They are covering their legs.

999
00:39:47,678 --> 00:39:48,848
Is that so?

1000
00:39:49,318 --> 00:39:51,018
(Il Woo substitutes Chung Sung.)

1001
00:39:51,118 --> 00:39:54,018
Il Woo is brought on as a substitute.

1002
00:39:54,218 --> 00:39:55,218
(Tae Se and Chan Yong enter.)

1003
00:39:55,318 --> 00:39:58,978
Tae Se and Chan Yong came in to substitute.

1004
00:39:59,418 --> 00:40:02,018
Tae Se is currently a player.

1005
00:40:02,118 --> 00:40:03,318
- That's true. - Let's expect him to play well.

1006
00:40:03,418 --> 00:40:04,418
You're my...

1007
00:40:04,718 --> 00:40:06,418
(Coach tells members to warm up.)

1008
00:40:06,478 --> 00:40:08,718
Good luck.

1009
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:13,018
(Kwang Soo and Jong Kook are waiting to enter the field.)

1010
00:40:13,018 --> 00:40:16,218
Kwang Soo and Jong Kook will be the next substitutes.

1011
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:18,818
Kwang Soo is quite tall.

1012
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:20,048
He's 190cm.

1013
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:21,818
He'd do well as a post player.

1014
00:40:21,918 --> 00:40:22,918
That's right.

1015
00:40:24,748 --> 00:40:26,318
Chun Soo starts to attack.

1016
00:40:26,378 --> 00:40:27,718
Chun Soo passes the ball.

1017
00:40:27,788 --> 00:40:28,788
(They are waiting for a chance.)

1018
00:40:29,018 --> 00:40:32,018
Kluivert receives the pass. Ji Sung!

1019
00:40:32,018 --> 00:40:33,418
Ji Sung makes a shoot.

1020
00:40:33,718 --> 00:40:35,318
He misses the perfect opportunity.

1021
00:40:35,478 --> 00:40:37,018
It's a pity.

1022
00:40:37,118 --> 00:40:39,218
This is the same place when he scored a goal...

1023
00:40:39,318 --> 00:40:40,948
in 2002 against Japan.

1024
00:40:41,918 --> 00:40:42,978
(Pull down your pants.)

1025
00:40:43,378 --> 00:40:45,878
He wears his pants pulled up too high.

1026
00:40:45,948 --> 00:40:48,418
It just looks like that because his legs are so long.

1027
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:50,218
His underclothes are showing.

1028
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:51,618
Substitute Ji Sung.

1029
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:54,218
Excuse me?

1030
00:40:56,318 --> 00:40:58,618
(Kwang Soo substitutes Ji Sung?)

1031
00:40:58,848 --> 00:41:00,748
(Will I be able to replace Ji Sung?)

1032
00:41:01,748 --> 00:41:03,418
Ji Sung comes to the bench.

1033
00:41:03,788 --> 00:41:05,748
As Ji Sung walks off the field,

1034
00:41:05,818 --> 00:41:08,978
he hands the captain's armband to Kwang Soo.

1035
00:41:09,218 --> 00:41:11,218
- That armband is special. - That's true.

1036
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:12,848
(Go, Captain Kwang Soo!)

1037
00:41:12,918 --> 00:41:15,788
Many Chinese fans have come to see Kwang Soo play today.

1038
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,218
So Yun substitutes Chun Soo.

1039
00:41:18,748 --> 00:41:20,848
- He looks exhausted. - You're right.

1040
00:41:20,918 --> 00:41:22,118
You did well Ji Sung.

1041
00:41:22,218 --> 00:41:24,478
- You did well. - Well done.

1042
00:41:24,518 --> 00:41:25,878
You did well.

1043
00:41:25,948 --> 00:41:27,218
Everyone on the bench,

1044
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,418
including the Running Man members,

1045
00:41:28,478 --> 00:41:30,418
greets Ji Sung.

1046
00:41:30,518 --> 00:41:32,118
Last time at the Indonesia match,

1047
00:41:32,218 --> 00:41:34,578
Kwang Soo actually missed...

1048
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:36,318
many opportunities.

1049
00:41:37,918 --> 00:41:39,118
Over here Kwang Soo!

1050
00:41:41,818 --> 00:41:44,718
(A huge failure in Jakarta)

1051
00:41:44,918 --> 00:41:46,318
(To redeem that day,)

1052
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:50,048
(he went into special training.)

1053
00:41:52,378 --> 00:41:54,418
- I thought he was Crouch. - Crouch?

1054
00:41:54,518 --> 00:41:55,878
He looks like Crouch.

1055
00:41:55,948 --> 00:41:58,818
He'll sit right back on the bench if he keeps on walking.

1056
00:41:58,918 --> 00:42:00,678
He might be as tall as Crouch.

1057
00:42:00,748 --> 00:42:02,918
Yes, the English football player Crouch.

1058
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,018
I think you might be right.

1059
00:42:04,118 --> 00:42:06,848
That's true, either Crouch or the Korean player Kim Shin Wook.

1060
00:42:06,918 --> 00:42:08,718
Tae Se passes the football.

1061
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:10,918
- It is a great opportunity. - Kwang Soo is ready.

1062
00:42:10,978 --> 00:42:13,318
- The ball is near Kwang Soo. - He just needs to kick it.

1063
00:42:13,418 --> 00:42:14,678
He just needs to make a run for it.

1064
00:42:14,718 --> 00:42:16,078
Kwang Soo!

1065
00:42:16,918 --> 00:42:18,748
(Crouch can take leaps and score.)

1066
00:42:18,818 --> 00:42:19,918
This is what we expect from him.

1067
00:42:20,048 --> 00:42:21,218
A little jump for Crouch...

1068
00:42:21,218 --> 00:42:23,518
overwhelms others.

1069
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:26,378
- Kwang Soo is similar. - That's true.

1070
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,878
His legs are just as long. The Korean Crouch,

1071
00:42:28,948 --> 00:42:30,418
Kwang Soo! Tae Se passes the ball.

1072
00:42:30,518 --> 00:42:32,618
- It's a great opportunity. - Kwang Soo is waiting.

1073
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:34,578
He just need to make a run for it.

1074
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:37,018
Kwang Soo! He runs towards the football.

1075
00:42:38,478 --> 00:42:39,918
(Will it be possible?)

1076
00:42:40,048 --> 00:42:41,818
(For Kwang Soo to score?)

1077
00:42:47,678 --> 00:42:48,678
What is that?

1078
00:42:48,748 --> 00:42:49,748
(A free hug)

1079
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:51,218
The ball is in the air.

1080
00:42:51,978 --> 00:42:53,618
His height is no asset to him.

1081
00:42:53,678 --> 00:42:56,718
He runs more like a defender than a striker.

1082
00:42:56,788 --> 00:42:59,018
(He is my replacement, right?)

1083
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,948
He had the perfect chance.

1084
00:43:01,018 --> 00:43:03,218
He just needed make a little jump.

1085
00:43:04,018 --> 00:43:05,788
But he falls down.

1086
00:43:05,848 --> 00:43:06,848
(He makes the day.)

1087
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,788
He lacked the power.

1088
00:43:08,848 --> 00:43:10,578
It looks like he's a trained slider.

1089
00:43:10,618 --> 00:43:12,518
He is running to nowhere.

1090
00:43:14,118 --> 00:43:17,788
- Tae Se gets the football. - Kwang Soo! The long-legged guy.

1091
00:43:17,848 --> 00:43:19,218
He dribbles the ball.

1092
00:43:19,578 --> 00:43:21,018
He is trapping the ball.

1093
00:43:21,118 --> 00:43:24,218
He attempts at something but loses the ball.

1094
00:43:25,018 --> 00:43:27,878
He clearly knows what trapping is but didn't practise enough.

1095
00:43:27,948 --> 00:43:30,118
The crowd looks quite amused.

1096
00:43:31,718 --> 00:43:32,878
His role is done.

1097
00:43:32,948 --> 00:43:34,318
He attempts to tackle.

1098
00:43:34,418 --> 00:43:36,218
It is good to see how eager he is at this game.

1099
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:37,378
Is he crying?

1100
00:43:38,018 --> 00:43:40,118
I can't bear to watch this.

1101
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:42,818
- I feel sorry for him. - I can't watch this.

1102
00:43:43,218 --> 00:43:45,018
We usually say moving without...

1103
00:43:45,018 --> 00:43:47,748
- the football is important. - That's right.

1104
00:43:47,818 --> 00:43:49,618
Today the football rolls by itself.

1105
00:43:49,948 --> 00:43:51,518
It's a great opportunity.

1106
00:43:51,578 --> 00:43:54,218
Tae Se keeps passing to Kwang Soo.

1107
00:43:54,218 --> 00:43:55,518
Kluivert makes a great pass.

1108
00:43:55,578 --> 00:43:57,018
Run faster!

1109
00:43:57,118 --> 00:43:59,218
- From the right back side. - No, you have to kick it forward.

1110
00:43:59,318 --> 00:44:01,218
The opponent isn't keen.

1111
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:02,618
He lets him pass. Kwang Soo...

1112
00:44:02,678 --> 00:44:05,018
makes a ground pass.

1113
00:44:05,118 --> 00:44:07,018
He just needed a little more energy.

1114
00:44:08,018 --> 00:44:10,218
The female fans are disappointed.

1115
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:12,018
The opponent gave a great chance.

1116
00:44:13,418 --> 00:44:14,848
His arms look so weak.

1117
00:44:15,118 --> 00:44:17,318
He isn't marked by anyone.

1118
00:44:17,418 --> 00:44:18,578
Everyone's just watching him.

1119
00:44:18,618 --> 00:44:20,048
No one is marking him.

1120
00:44:20,048 --> 00:44:21,978
That's right.

1121
00:44:22,018 --> 00:44:23,118
He dribbles the football fast.

1122
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:26,078
He passes the football which is smoothly received...

1123
00:44:26,078 --> 00:44:27,478
but is caught by the goalkeeper.

1124
00:44:27,518 --> 00:44:28,618
You did great!

1125
00:44:28,678 --> 00:44:29,818
(We need Jong Kook's skills dearly.)

1126
00:44:29,878 --> 00:44:32,318
All eyes are on Jong Kook.

1127
00:44:32,418 --> 00:44:35,418
If the opponent let him pass, he would have scored a goal.

1128
00:44:35,478 --> 00:44:37,018
It's quite a pity.

1129
00:44:39,018 --> 00:44:40,378
He dribbles the football!

1130
00:44:40,418 --> 00:44:41,718
The football is passed to Jong Kook.

1131
00:44:41,778 --> 00:44:43,678
He can make this.

1132
00:44:43,748 --> 00:44:46,718
- He needs to push. - He is tackling the opponent.

1133
00:44:47,978 --> 00:44:51,418
(He has been preparing for this moment for a long time.)

1134
00:44:54,848 --> 00:44:56,418
(This is the perfect opportunity to show off his muscle power.)

1135
00:44:56,478 --> 00:44:58,118
(Show us your skills!)

1136
00:44:58,218 --> 00:44:59,218
(Show us!)

1137
00:44:59,318 --> 00:45:00,948
Jong Kook!

1138
00:45:01,018 --> 00:45:02,018
He can make this.

1139
00:45:02,118 --> 00:45:05,918
(Will he make it?)

1140
00:45:05,978 --> 00:45:07,018
(The opponent pushes him aside.)

1141
00:45:07,518 --> 00:45:10,818
(Look at Jong Kook getting pushed aside.)

1142
00:45:10,918 --> 00:45:12,618
It's not all about strength.

1143
00:45:12,718 --> 00:45:13,718
You need to have the skills too.

1144
00:45:13,778 --> 00:45:15,418
It must be an honour.

1145
00:45:15,478 --> 00:45:17,418
To receive a pass from Kluivert.

1146
00:45:17,518 --> 00:45:20,048
- It must be an honour. - Yes, it must be.

1147
00:45:20,048 --> 00:45:22,318
The opponent easily...

1148
00:45:22,378 --> 00:45:24,818
blocked him.

1149
00:45:24,878 --> 00:45:28,748
He lost in the tussle for the ball yet again.

1150
00:45:29,418 --> 00:45:31,018
Balance is the key.

1151
00:45:31,118 --> 00:45:32,818
He's as weak as a paper tiger.

1152
00:45:35,418 --> 00:45:36,818
A paper tiger?

1153
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:40,518
- He's a real entertainer today. - A paper tiger!

1154
00:45:41,678 --> 00:45:43,218
(Will he be able to redeem himself?)

1155
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:44,318
So Yun!

1156
00:45:44,848 --> 00:45:47,318
She is supporting from behind.

1157
00:45:47,418 --> 00:45:49,418
But the members aren't ready.

1158
00:45:49,478 --> 00:45:50,978
She gets the ball.

1159
00:45:51,018 --> 00:45:52,578
Great play.

1160
00:45:53,378 --> 00:45:54,478
Jae Sung is doing well.

1161
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:55,878
He's in a great position.

1162
00:45:55,948 --> 00:45:57,918
Il Woo!

1163
00:45:57,978 --> 00:46:00,048
(Il Woo follows the football.)

1164
00:46:01,818 --> 00:46:04,818
He looks handsome even from this afar.

1165
00:46:05,948 --> 00:46:07,018
(Handsome)

1166
00:46:07,118 --> 00:46:08,318
Il Woo is still handsome when he's panting.

1167
00:46:09,318 --> 00:46:10,618
This isn't an easy game.

1168
00:46:10,678 --> 00:46:13,118
The opponents are all members of the national team.

1169
00:46:13,218 --> 00:46:15,518
Considering that they are playing against such a team,

1170
00:46:15,578 --> 00:46:17,418
they are doing great.

1171
00:46:17,478 --> 00:46:19,218
Il Woo is doing great.

1172
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:22,378
(He kicks the ball and runs for it.)

1173
00:46:22,418 --> 00:46:24,518
- He must be an experienced player. - I think you're right. So Yun!

1174
00:46:24,618 --> 00:46:27,118
She passes the football but is blocked.

1175
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:30,578
Il Woo's attempt to pressure the goalkeeper and defence...

1176
00:46:30,618 --> 00:46:33,018
from the front side is a great move.

1177
00:46:33,018 --> 00:46:36,418
- He has been running for so long. - He is very willing.

1178
00:46:36,478 --> 00:46:38,918
You're right. Though he may lack the skills,

1179
00:46:38,978 --> 00:46:40,948
his willpower is the best.

1180
00:46:45,578 --> 00:46:47,878
- That's a great move. - He makes a pass.

1181
00:46:47,948 --> 00:46:50,878
Kluivert makes a pass. Tae Se!

1182
00:46:50,948 --> 00:46:52,848
That's how you tussle.

1183
00:46:52,918 --> 00:46:54,018
Kwang Soo runs to support.

1184
00:46:54,018 --> 00:46:55,218
They're doing great.

1185
00:46:55,318 --> 00:46:56,518
Kwang Soo runs to support.

1186
00:46:56,578 --> 00:46:59,018
- Kwang Soo is catching up! - He just needs to make a pass.

1187
00:46:59,118 --> 00:47:01,118
Tae Se makes a shoot.

1188
00:47:01,478 --> 00:47:02,778
He didn't trust Kwang Soo.

1189
00:47:02,848 --> 00:47:05,018
- He couldn't trust him. - Right.

1190
00:47:05,848 --> 00:47:07,018
Kwang Soo...

1191
00:47:07,418 --> 00:47:10,118
Kwang Soo is on Tae Se's team...

1192
00:47:10,218 --> 00:47:11,378
but he didn't earn Tae Se's trust.

1193
00:47:11,518 --> 00:47:13,618
It would have been a right move to pass to Kwang Soo,

1194
00:47:13,678 --> 00:47:15,018
but he couldn't trust him.

1195
00:47:15,118 --> 00:47:17,418
I would love to watch Kwang Soo make a header.

1196
00:47:17,478 --> 00:47:18,518
Me too!

1197
00:47:19,418 --> 00:47:20,618
He even practised earlier on.

1198
00:47:20,918 --> 00:47:23,378
Just before, Kluivert and Tae Se...

1199
00:47:23,418 --> 00:47:25,218
- played very well. - Right.

1200
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:26,418
It's a pity that it ended like this.

1201
00:47:26,518 --> 00:47:28,418
The first half is over.

1202
00:47:28,918 --> 00:47:30,048
Be careful!

1203
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:31,478
We didn't score any more points.

1204
00:47:31,978 --> 00:47:34,218
The Korean All Stars lead with a point.

1205
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,918
We witnessed Kluivert's superb goal.

1206
00:47:36,978 --> 00:47:39,118
Yes, and also Byung Ji's good defence.

1207
00:47:39,118 --> 00:47:40,478
They are leading the game.

1208
00:47:40,518 --> 00:47:44,018
Kwang Soo and Jong Kook gave their all.

1209
00:47:44,118 --> 00:47:45,918
They did push to their limits.

1210
00:47:45,978 --> 00:47:47,678
(No points for Team Ji Sung and Team Tae Se)

1211
00:47:48,618 --> 00:47:51,778
(Everyone enters the locker room.)

1212
00:47:51,848 --> 00:47:53,018
Kwang Soo, is that all you have?

1213
00:47:53,118 --> 00:47:54,118
Gary.

1214
00:47:55,018 --> 00:47:56,118
You did well, Kwang Soo.

1215
00:47:56,518 --> 00:47:58,318
You did well.

1216
00:47:58,378 --> 00:47:59,518
So Yun, you did well.

1217
00:48:00,218 --> 00:48:01,418
(The MVP of the first half)

1218
00:48:01,518 --> 00:48:03,518
- She fought alone in the midfield. - Yes, that's true.

1219
00:48:03,578 --> 00:48:04,678
Nobody was in the centre.

1220
00:48:05,748 --> 00:48:09,918
(iKON's special stage)

1221
00:48:13,118 --> 00:48:15,818
In the first half, there was one assist...

1222
00:48:15,878 --> 00:48:17,118
from Chung Sung.

1223
00:48:17,918 --> 00:48:20,218
And one goal from Kluivert.

1224
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:22,118
(Each earned a point for the team.)

1225
00:48:22,218 --> 00:48:24,518
There was one good defence by Byung Ji.

1226
00:48:24,618 --> 00:48:25,918
Well done.

1227
00:48:25,978 --> 00:48:29,418
(Team So Yun, alone, earns three points.)

1228
00:48:29,848 --> 00:48:31,318
Earlier on Coach, you said...

1229
00:48:31,418 --> 00:48:34,578
Jae Seok will join. Which position do you have in mind for him?

1230
00:48:35,378 --> 00:48:37,818
He's eager to score a goal.

1231
00:48:37,878 --> 00:48:41,918
So he'll play as a striker with Tae Se.

1232
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,248
(Striker)

1233
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:45,318
Me?

1234
00:48:45,748 --> 00:48:47,018
I can't possibly do that, Coach.

1235
00:48:48,748 --> 00:48:50,048
If you find it difficult to score,

1236
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:51,618
you can substitute Crouch.

1237
00:48:51,718 --> 00:48:53,318
No, I'm ready now!

1238
00:48:53,378 --> 00:48:54,818
(Crouch is ready to score.)

1239
00:48:55,948 --> 00:48:59,418
(We'll lead the second half.)

1240
00:48:59,518 --> 00:49:01,978
(How will they play?)

1241
00:49:02,218 --> 00:49:04,718
Let's go score some goals!

1242
00:49:04,878 --> 00:49:06,478
(It's time to finish the match.)

1243
00:49:06,578 --> 00:49:07,918
All right.

1244
00:49:08,018 --> 00:49:09,178
(Let's just keep up this momentum.)

1245
00:49:09,218 --> 00:49:10,818
- One, two, three. - We can do this.

1246
00:49:10,918 --> 00:49:11,978
- All right. - Yes.

1247
00:49:12,718 --> 00:49:14,418
(The second half starts.)

1248
00:49:17,018 --> 00:49:19,118
They switched out the players for the second half.

1249
00:49:19,618 --> 00:49:21,118
I wonder if...

1250
00:49:21,218 --> 00:49:24,618
Haha and Jae Seok will get to play as promised.

1251
00:49:24,718 --> 00:49:26,478
Right. There may have been some changes.

1252
00:49:26,548 --> 00:49:27,818
- There he is. - He's out on the field.

1253
00:49:27,918 --> 00:49:30,548
Jae Seok looks just like Kim Bo Kyung without his glasses on.

1254
00:49:30,618 --> 00:49:33,378
- Last time, he was on the field. - Right.

1255
00:49:33,448 --> 00:49:34,918
- They took a picture together. - Yes.

1256
00:49:34,978 --> 00:49:36,718
- No one could tell them apart. - That's right.

1257
00:49:37,218 --> 00:49:41,018
With his glasses off, Jae Seok will join the second half.

1258
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:43,378
Will he be able to do well in the second half?

1259
00:49:44,178 --> 00:49:45,178
But, still...

1260
00:49:45,818 --> 00:49:47,348
Joong Ki, don't push yourself too hard.

1261
00:49:48,348 --> 00:49:50,048
He's going to play for five minutes?

1262
00:49:50,048 --> 00:49:51,218
(Joong Ki has a knee injury.)

1263
00:49:51,278 --> 00:49:52,618
- You shouldn't play. - Joong Ki...

1264
00:49:52,618 --> 00:49:54,818
- has a knee injury. - I see.

1265
00:49:55,548 --> 00:49:59,278
Song Joong Ki used to play with the Running Man members.

1266
00:49:59,978 --> 00:50:01,178
(Jae Seok is nervous.)

1267
00:50:01,218 --> 00:50:03,218
Does Jae Seok know what he's doing?

1268
00:50:03,278 --> 00:50:05,278
Jae Seok will play as a striker with Tae Se.

1269
00:50:05,348 --> 00:50:08,118
- He's going to have a tough time. - Right.

1270
00:50:08,578 --> 00:50:10,518
How will he play?

1271
00:50:10,818 --> 00:50:12,348
Jae Seok looks so thin.

1272
00:50:13,118 --> 00:50:14,178
(Jae Seok is very thin.)

1273
00:50:14,218 --> 00:50:15,578
Jae Seok looks so thin.

1274
00:50:15,678 --> 00:50:17,718
Why did he tuck his shirt in?

1275
00:50:18,118 --> 00:50:19,478
Untuck your shirt!

1276
00:50:19,718 --> 00:50:20,918
He's like an old lady.

1277
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,078
He's like an old lady, right?

1278
00:50:22,118 --> 00:50:23,348
He's like an old lady in an aerobics class.

1279
00:50:23,418 --> 00:50:24,818
(Is he really the striker?)

1280
00:50:24,818 --> 00:50:25,918
With his headband on...

1281
00:50:26,218 --> 00:50:27,378
(The reason he has a headband on...)

1282
00:50:27,448 --> 00:50:28,818
He's about to shoot...

1283
00:50:29,118 --> 00:50:30,278
Shoot.

1284
00:50:30,348 --> 00:50:34,818
(Jae Seok missed a penalty kick in the 2013 Dream Cup.)

1285
00:50:38,448 --> 00:50:43,718
(In the 2014 Dream Cup, he made another terrible mistake.)

1286
00:50:45,078 --> 00:50:46,818
Jae Seok is very passionate.

1287
00:50:46,818 --> 00:50:48,378
(Jae Seok hasn't scored a single goal.)

1288
00:50:48,618 --> 00:50:50,818
(But today is going to be different.)

1289
00:50:51,018 --> 00:50:53,818
(Jae Seok charges towards the ball.)

1290
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:59,078
(Jae Seok is putting pressure on his opponent's defence.)

1291
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:05,818
(He became much more agile through the years of ripping off name tags.)

1292
00:51:05,818 --> 00:51:06,978
(What just happened?)

1293
00:51:07,018 --> 00:51:08,978
- The defence doesn't falter easily. - Right.

1294
00:51:09,448 --> 00:51:10,518
Jae Seok is still excited.

1295
00:51:10,578 --> 00:51:11,718
(The ball is faster than him.)

1296
00:51:12,178 --> 00:51:13,818
He looks like Kim Bo Kyung,

1297
00:51:13,918 --> 00:51:16,118
but I think he's still warming up.

1298
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:20,618
He's wasting his energy by...

1299
00:51:20,718 --> 00:51:22,478
- making meaningless moves. - Right.

1300
00:51:25,018 --> 00:51:26,218
(Jae Seok spots an opening.)

1301
00:51:29,278 --> 00:51:31,718
(Jae Seok tries to steal the ball.)

1302
00:51:35,818 --> 00:51:36,918
(Jae Seok fails.)

1303
00:51:38,078 --> 00:51:41,418
- He's got to do better than that. - Right.

1304
00:51:41,918 --> 00:51:43,118
What are you doing, Jae Seok?

1305
00:51:43,178 --> 00:51:44,218
(What are you doing, Jae Seok?)

1306
00:51:44,448 --> 00:51:46,118
Please pull your shirt out of the shorts.

1307
00:51:47,618 --> 00:51:48,618
Your shirt!

1308
00:51:48,618 --> 00:51:50,818
(It's not going as planned.)

1309
00:51:51,318 --> 00:51:52,578
(The coach said...)

1310
00:51:52,618 --> 00:51:55,518
When the time is right, pass the ball to Crouch.

1311
00:51:55,578 --> 00:51:57,318
Yes, I will do my best!

1312
00:51:57,378 --> 00:51:58,718
(Pass the ball to Kwang Soo.)

1313
00:52:01,578 --> 00:52:02,918
(Kwang Soo is running.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1314
00:52:03,018 --> 00:52:04,218
- Right. - There he goes.

1315
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:05,378
Go.

1316
00:52:05,978 --> 00:52:09,218
(It's time to show off their amazing teamwork.)

1317
00:52:12,418 --> 00:52:13,518
(Pass it to me!)

1318
00:52:15,078 --> 00:52:17,618
(He lets Tae Se take the ball to the centre.)

1319
00:52:19,618 --> 00:52:21,078
(Tae Se crosses the ball over.)

1320
00:52:23,518 --> 00:52:25,118
(Jae Seok prepares to shoot.)

1321
00:52:27,918 --> 00:52:31,348
(Will Jae Seok score for the first time in five years?)

1322
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:36,718
(Excuse me.)

1323
00:52:41,548 --> 00:52:43,018
(Kwang Soo suddenly tackles.)

1324
00:52:43,078 --> 00:52:44,978
Kwang Soo does a slide tackle.

1325
00:52:46,018 --> 00:52:47,618
He gave the ball to the other team.

1326
00:52:47,618 --> 00:52:51,018
(The two worst members of the team make terrible mistakes.)

1327
00:52:51,078 --> 00:52:54,618
Even Ji Sung, who never criticises his teammates, is laughing.

1328
00:52:54,618 --> 00:52:55,978
(Even Ji Sung, who never criticises his teammates, is laughing.)

1329
00:52:57,478 --> 00:52:59,218
- All right. - This is a good opportunity.

1330
00:52:59,278 --> 00:53:00,418
(Kwang Soo might get an assist.)

1331
00:53:01,918 --> 00:53:03,618
Kwang Soo passes...

1332
00:53:03,978 --> 00:53:07,348
Kwang Soo passes, but it was a ground ball.

1333
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:09,478
- Oh, no. - Why was that a ground ball?

1334
00:53:09,548 --> 00:53:12,448
- Why can't he kick right? - There were a lot of players.

1335
00:53:12,518 --> 00:53:13,578
What's wrong with him?

1336
00:53:13,718 --> 00:53:15,678
- He knows he can't do much. - Right.

1337
00:53:16,348 --> 00:53:19,118
We can't even see where Jae Seok is right now.

1338
00:53:19,218 --> 00:53:20,718
Covering a lot of the ground isn't enough.

1339
00:53:21,578 --> 00:53:24,618
The Chinese defence is ignoring Kwang Soo.

1340
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:26,118
- Why isn't he running? - Right.

1341
00:53:26,518 --> 00:53:28,018
He passes his ball to his team member again.

1342
00:53:28,218 --> 00:53:30,048
- He should run. - Tae Se is tired...

1343
00:53:30,578 --> 00:53:32,078
because they keep passing the ball to him.

1344
00:53:32,378 --> 00:53:33,718
From the right flank... He's too tired.

1345
00:53:33,818 --> 00:53:35,678
They have a chance. This time...

1346
00:53:35,918 --> 00:53:37,018
He should have kicked higher.

1347
00:53:37,078 --> 00:53:38,618
- I'd be angry if I were him. - Right.

1348
00:53:39,178 --> 00:53:42,548
He said he would run inside and do a header.

1349
00:53:42,718 --> 00:53:45,118
Neither Jae Seok nor Kwang Soo did much.

1350
00:53:45,218 --> 00:53:47,478
Why are they tired? They didn't even run much.

1351
00:53:47,548 --> 00:53:48,918
(The two keep messing up the game for the team.)

1352
00:53:50,718 --> 00:53:52,518
(Right now, they need Jong Kook.)

1353
00:53:52,578 --> 00:53:54,118
- All right. - He's doing a good job.

1354
00:53:54,178 --> 00:53:55,218
He passes.

1355
00:53:55,318 --> 00:53:57,578
- He's doing well. - Jong Kook!

1356
00:53:57,578 --> 00:53:58,578
He's fast.

1357
00:53:58,578 --> 00:53:59,618
He sprints towards the ball.

1358
00:54:00,218 --> 00:54:01,448
But he misses.

1359
00:54:01,718 --> 00:54:03,348
Jong Kook still dribbled...

1360
00:54:03,418 --> 00:54:05,218
and passed very well.

1361
00:54:05,348 --> 00:54:07,718
- He had the control over the ball. - He did an amazing job.

1362
00:54:07,718 --> 00:54:09,218
He is like a professional player.

1363
00:54:09,278 --> 00:54:11,118
He tore through the defence.

1364
00:54:12,018 --> 00:54:14,818
So Yun is playing her part as the playmaker in the back.

1365
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:15,918
Jong Kook.

1366
00:54:16,018 --> 00:54:17,278
(Jong Kook is full of energy.)

1367
00:54:19,178 --> 00:54:20,718
They could easily defend.

1368
00:54:20,918 --> 00:54:22,618
(Jong Kook gets the team back on track.)

1369
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:24,118
He's helping from the back.

1370
00:54:24,918 --> 00:54:26,018
So Yun received the ball.

1371
00:54:26,418 --> 00:54:27,818
- Through pass. - Wow.

1372
00:54:27,818 --> 00:54:30,218
- That was a nice play. - That was So Yun's through pass.

1373
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:31,618
- Ji So Yun. - There he goes.

1374
00:54:31,718 --> 00:54:33,218
Jong Kook. It's his chance.

1375
00:54:34,718 --> 00:54:35,718
It's very boring.

1376
00:54:35,818 --> 00:54:36,918
It's so boring...

1377
00:54:37,018 --> 00:54:38,218
(Jong Kook seemed to know much about football.)

1378
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:39,518
Jong Kook sounded like he could play well.

1379
00:54:40,048 --> 00:54:42,918
(Jong Kook is looking for an opening.)

1380
00:54:43,018 --> 00:54:44,578
He's fully warmed-up.

1381
00:54:44,718 --> 00:54:45,718
He sprints inside.

1382
00:54:45,818 --> 00:54:47,818
So Yun passes to Jong Kook.

1383
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:49,118
It's a one-on-one situation.

1384
00:54:49,218 --> 00:54:50,318
It's the perfect chance.

1385
00:54:50,378 --> 00:54:51,548
He's in front of the goalkeeper.

1386
00:54:51,718 --> 00:54:53,418
Jong Kook.

1387
00:54:56,978 --> 00:54:58,518
(He is about to kick with his left feet.)

1388
00:55:04,018 --> 00:55:05,178
He did it.

1389
00:55:09,818 --> 00:55:11,318
Jong Kook.

1390
00:55:11,578 --> 00:55:13,218
(He has to score a goal.)

1391
00:55:13,318 --> 00:55:14,618
What the... What?

1392
00:55:15,018 --> 00:55:16,178
No way!

1393
00:55:16,218 --> 00:55:17,818
(He trips.)

1394
00:55:19,378 --> 00:55:21,378
- This is... - What on earth just happened?

1395
00:55:21,448 --> 00:55:22,518
(He looked like he was dancing.)

1396
00:55:22,578 --> 00:55:23,818
This is unbelievable.

1397
00:55:25,218 --> 00:55:27,018
What is wrong with him?

1398
00:55:28,918 --> 00:55:32,218
(Jong Kook's teammates are embarrassed.)

1399
00:55:32,278 --> 00:55:33,418
This can't be happening.

1400
00:55:33,478 --> 00:55:35,078
- Wow. - Come on!

1401
00:55:36,578 --> 00:55:40,818
- What the... - This is unbelievable.

1402
00:55:41,278 --> 00:55:42,518
(Laughing)

1403
00:55:42,578 --> 00:55:43,818
He kicked the grass instead.

1404
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:47,918
(Jong Kook looked like he was drunk.)

1405
00:55:48,918 --> 00:55:51,178
He spent all his life working out in the gym.

1406
00:55:51,218 --> 00:55:52,548
How could that be possible?

1407
00:55:52,618 --> 00:55:53,918
Ji Sung, he should have scored, right?

1408
00:55:54,278 --> 00:55:55,718
- Yes, of course. - He should have scored, right?

1409
00:55:55,818 --> 00:55:57,318
- That was a great opportunity. - He should have scored.

1410
00:55:57,378 --> 00:55:58,378
He should have scored.

1411
00:55:59,018 --> 00:56:00,518
But he fell down.

1412
00:56:00,618 --> 00:56:04,618
(Uncomfortable)

1413
00:56:04,718 --> 00:56:05,918
Switch out three players.

1414
00:56:05,978 --> 00:56:07,278
- Switch out 3 players. - 3?

1415
00:56:07,348 --> 00:56:08,418
Now? Three players?

1416
00:56:08,478 --> 00:56:09,918
(Who will replace them?)

1417
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:14,818
(The Chinese All Stars start advancing towards the goalpost.)

1418
00:56:17,018 --> 00:56:19,218
Look at her kick the ball away. Ji So Yun.

1419
00:56:19,478 --> 00:56:20,978
They pushed her even though she's a woman.

1420
00:56:21,018 --> 00:56:23,818
So Yun isn't scared of pushing male players.

1421
00:56:24,018 --> 00:56:26,178
Jae Seok trips the other team's player.

1422
00:56:27,018 --> 00:56:29,378
Jae Seok tripped the player who pushed So Yun.

1423
00:56:29,448 --> 00:56:31,218
- He avenged her. - He avenged her.

1424
00:56:31,348 --> 00:56:32,378
Jae Seok tripped him.

1425
00:56:32,918 --> 00:56:34,278
Jae Seok runs towards it.

1426
00:56:34,548 --> 00:56:35,578
Jae Seok runs to the side.

1427
00:56:35,818 --> 00:56:37,018
They're being pushed back.

1428
00:56:37,078 --> 00:56:38,318
He shoots with his left foot.

1429
00:56:39,118 --> 00:56:41,348
Things are starting to change in the second half.

1430
00:56:41,618 --> 00:56:43,818
As the Chinese All Stars are pushing harder,

1431
00:56:43,918 --> 00:56:45,678
they seem to have the upper hand.

1432
00:56:45,718 --> 00:56:47,348
The Chinese team has an impressive lineup.

1433
00:56:47,418 --> 00:56:51,218
The legendary player Fan Zhiyi is out on the field.

1434
00:56:51,318 --> 00:56:53,718
In addition, there is...

1435
00:56:53,818 --> 00:56:56,018
Yang Chen, who used to be in a German team.

1436
00:56:56,078 --> 00:56:57,578
- There are a lot of good players. - Right.

1437
00:56:57,618 --> 00:56:59,118
- There we go. - Right.

1438
00:56:59,218 --> 00:57:00,548
- Shoot. - Shoot.

1439
00:57:00,618 --> 00:57:01,918
The goalkeeper blocks it.

1440
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:03,348
That was an amazing save.

1441
00:57:03,818 --> 00:57:04,818
A header. Here's another chance.

1442
00:57:05,218 --> 00:57:06,618
He's a good goalkeeper.

1443
00:57:07,448 --> 00:57:08,718
Whose team is the goalkeeper in?

1444
00:57:08,818 --> 00:57:09,818
He's in our team.

1445
00:57:09,918 --> 00:57:11,218
- He's in our team? - Yes.

1446
00:57:11,318 --> 00:57:12,618
Right. That was a nice save.

1447
00:57:12,818 --> 00:57:14,178
I think he's in our team.

1448
00:57:14,218 --> 00:57:15,818
- Nice job. - That was a nice save.

1449
00:57:16,018 --> 00:57:18,618
Team Tae Se earns one point.

1450
00:57:21,178 --> 00:57:25,018
(Announcing the three players who will get to play)

1451
00:57:25,118 --> 00:57:27,118
- They're busy switching players. - Right.

1452
00:57:27,548 --> 00:57:29,118
They are putting...

1453
00:57:29,218 --> 00:57:30,818
in different players.

1454
00:57:31,348 --> 00:57:32,618
- Me too? - Yes, get ready.

1455
00:57:32,618 --> 00:57:34,478
- Should I get ready? - The director is switching players.

1456
00:57:34,548 --> 00:57:35,718
- Okay. - Thank you.

1457
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:36,918
He told me to get ready, too.

1458
00:57:36,978 --> 00:57:38,118
Let's go.

1459
00:57:38,918 --> 00:57:41,978
Gary, Haha and Seok Jin are warming up.

1460
00:57:42,578 --> 00:57:43,718
They might hurt themselves while warming up.

1461
00:57:43,718 --> 00:57:44,818
(Seok Jin looks bizarre.)

1462
00:57:45,078 --> 00:57:46,118
Hey.

1463
00:57:46,178 --> 00:57:47,218
They know they're in trouble.

1464
00:57:47,318 --> 00:57:49,718
(They're switching players to turn the game around.)

1465
00:57:50,818 --> 00:57:53,218
Jong Kook is out.

1466
00:57:53,318 --> 00:57:54,918
(Jong Kook out, Kim Se Joon in.)

1467
00:57:55,018 --> 00:57:56,278
- He covered a lot of ground. - Right.

1468
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:57,618
He did very well.

1469
00:58:00,218 --> 00:58:03,118
Kwang Soo is out, and Il Woo is going in.

1470
00:58:03,218 --> 00:58:04,818
How should we rate...

1471
00:58:05,518 --> 00:58:07,118
Jae Seok's performance?

1472
00:58:08,348 --> 00:58:10,118
- What exactly did he do? - Right.

1473
00:58:10,448 --> 00:58:13,448
He didn't do anything noteworthy out on the field.

1474
00:58:13,618 --> 00:58:15,978
We will give him a zero.

1475
00:58:17,618 --> 00:58:19,448
- Gary is in now. - Right.

1476
00:58:19,548 --> 00:58:21,478
Gary's physique is solid.

1477
00:58:21,548 --> 00:58:23,918
Seok Jin took his glasses off as well.

1478
00:58:26,618 --> 00:58:27,978
That was a very good exercise for my joints.

1479
00:58:28,618 --> 00:58:29,718
Seriously.

1480
00:58:30,118 --> 00:58:31,818
You might think I didn't do much,

1481
00:58:31,918 --> 00:58:33,218
but I ran so much.

1482
00:58:33,318 --> 00:58:34,378
(But I ran so much.)

1483
00:58:34,618 --> 00:58:36,818
Apparently, you were running where we couldn't see you.

1484
00:58:36,918 --> 00:58:37,978
- I didn't notice him. - Right.

1485
00:58:38,018 --> 00:58:39,278
- I couldn't see you. - You couldn't see me.

1486
00:58:43,348 --> 00:58:45,718
It's not easy because football is a team sport.

1487
00:58:46,218 --> 00:58:47,318
Seok Jin.

1488
00:58:48,618 --> 00:58:49,718
- What just happened? - Seok Jin.

1489
00:58:50,548 --> 00:58:52,218
- The ball was taken. - Right.

1490
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:55,448
He tried to get the ball with his foot, but he accidentally passed it.

1491
00:58:55,518 --> 00:58:58,078
I've never seen the director laugh out loud before.

1492
00:58:58,218 --> 00:58:59,378
(He misses the ball.)

1493
00:58:59,718 --> 00:59:01,178
- Wow. - That was hilarious.

1494
00:59:01,218 --> 00:59:02,478
He tried to grab the other player by the collar.

1495
00:59:02,478 --> 00:59:03,518
(He tried to grab the other player by the collar.)

1496
00:59:03,978 --> 00:59:06,318
Thank you for making us laugh.

1497
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:08,048
(Last year, he could never even touch the football.)

1498
00:59:10,348 --> 00:59:11,948
Tae Se is reliable.

1499
00:59:12,018 --> 00:59:14,018
He passes the ball to So Yun.

1500
00:59:14,048 --> 00:59:15,548
Gary gets the chance.

1501
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:17,978
Gary is very athletic too.

1502
00:59:18,048 --> 00:59:20,778
He tries to pass the ball to So Yun but fails.

1503
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:23,148
It was short, but it was better than Kwang Soo's shoot.

1504
00:59:23,248 --> 00:59:24,248
Yes.

1505
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:27,848
Gary is as fit as any professional football player.

1506
00:59:27,918 --> 00:59:29,518
Yes. The right side is coming to life now.

1507
00:59:29,548 --> 00:59:30,748
Jong Tae Se.

1508
00:59:31,348 --> 00:59:34,418
- He passes it back to Haha. - It's a return pass.

1509
00:59:34,448 --> 00:59:36,448
- Return pass! - I never knew he could do that.

1510
00:59:36,518 --> 00:59:38,878
- I didn't know that was possible. - Right. Tae Se...

1511
00:59:38,948 --> 00:59:40,718
passes to So Yun. And she goes for a mid-range shoot!

1512
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:41,948
It didn't go in.

1513
00:59:42,018 --> 00:59:45,118
The team leaders, Tae Se and So Yun are eager to win.

1514
00:59:45,118 --> 00:59:46,518
- Yes. - They are determined to win.

1515
00:59:46,548 --> 00:59:50,148
Team Ji Sung still hasn't earned any points.

1516
00:59:50,348 --> 00:59:52,918
It's a competition between Team Tae Se and Team So Yun.

1517
00:59:52,978 --> 00:59:55,418
Yes. Ji Sung played quite terribly.

1518
00:59:57,048 --> 00:59:58,878
Tae Se passes the ball to the other side.

1519
00:59:58,948 --> 01:00:00,818
(Tae Se shoots the football to the opposite corner.)

1520
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:02,518
That's nice!

1521
01:00:02,548 --> 01:00:04,878
Haha runs fast towards the ball.

1522
01:00:04,948 --> 01:00:06,048
- Haha! - Haha!

1523
01:00:06,148 --> 01:00:07,148
(Haha sprints.)

1524
01:00:07,148 --> 01:00:08,248
- Haha! - Haha!

1525
01:00:09,048 --> 01:00:10,248
Haha!

1526
01:00:10,348 --> 01:00:11,818
Oh no.

1527
01:00:12,148 --> 01:00:14,248
(Haha reminds us of...)

1528
01:00:14,348 --> 01:00:16,018
(someone else.)

1529
01:00:16,048 --> 01:00:17,718
Oh, gosh!

1530
01:00:17,918 --> 01:00:18,918
Oh no.

1531
01:00:19,548 --> 01:00:21,048
(He was just like Jong Kook.)

1532
01:00:21,148 --> 01:00:23,878
Jong Kook is out.

1533
01:00:23,948 --> 01:00:25,018
Yes.

1534
01:00:25,118 --> 01:00:26,148
Who was it?

1535
01:00:27,148 --> 01:00:30,148
(Haha has long legs.)

1536
01:00:30,618 --> 01:00:32,348
The Chinese fan is lying.

1537
01:00:32,918 --> 01:00:35,548
Ji Hyo is going out.

1538
01:00:35,718 --> 01:00:38,548
Ji Hyo is ready to go out.

1539
01:00:39,048 --> 01:00:41,348
Her number is 7012.

1540
01:00:41,418 --> 01:00:43,048
It's our first time seeing someone with a four-digit number.

1541
01:00:43,148 --> 01:00:45,648
Football players usually use 1 or 2-digit numbers.

1542
01:00:45,718 --> 01:00:49,148
Yes. Song Ji Hyo got the number 7012 because...

1543
01:00:49,248 --> 01:00:52,618
it means the seven members of Running Man will...

1544
01:00:52,648 --> 01:00:55,848
be together forever.

1545
01:00:57,718 --> 01:00:59,778
Super Serve, Ji Hyo is in.

1546
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:01,718
- She's the Super Serve. - Yes.

1547
01:01:01,878 --> 01:01:03,718
- She's very good. - That's right.

1548
01:01:04,248 --> 01:01:05,248
(The football is passed to her.)

1549
01:01:05,348 --> 01:01:06,348
Gosh.

1550
01:01:07,148 --> 01:01:08,548
- Ji Hyo gets the ball. - Hey!

1551
01:01:08,648 --> 01:01:10,748
- Ji Hyo. - Pass the ball!

1552
01:01:11,618 --> 01:01:12,618
Pass!

1553
01:01:12,848 --> 01:01:13,878
She's good.

1554
01:01:14,048 --> 01:01:16,248
She was surprised when he approached her.

1555
01:01:16,448 --> 01:01:19,148
When the other team player approached her, she got surprised.

1556
01:01:19,248 --> 01:01:21,778
Kim Tae Young. Ji Hyo again.

1557
01:01:22,918 --> 01:01:25,718
Ji Hyo. She's not good, but she manages to pass the ball.

1558
01:01:25,778 --> 01:01:27,748
(She's slow, but she's precise.)

1559
01:01:27,818 --> 01:01:30,048
She passes to the Jong Tae Se in the centre.

1560
01:01:30,048 --> 01:01:31,148
Shoot!

1561
01:01:31,148 --> 01:01:32,778
It hit the goalpost.

1562
01:01:33,248 --> 01:01:35,518
- He's good. - It was close.

1563
01:01:35,548 --> 01:01:36,918
- He's amazing. - Yes.

1564
01:01:37,818 --> 01:01:40,048
He stopped the ball and shot it with his right foot.

1565
01:01:40,148 --> 01:01:41,548
It's the standard method.

1566
01:01:41,648 --> 01:01:43,448
(The ball hits the goalpost after his powerful shoot.)

1567
01:01:45,548 --> 01:01:46,778
(But he lost the chance to earn a point again.)

1568
01:01:46,848 --> 01:01:48,448
Now only several minutes remain.

1569
01:01:48,548 --> 01:01:49,618
(Now only several minutes remain, and they resume the attack.)

1570
01:01:49,778 --> 01:01:51,818
Kim Tae Young starts from the centre.

1571
01:01:53,018 --> 01:01:54,048
He passes the ball to Jong Tae Se.

1572
01:01:55,148 --> 01:01:57,778
Jong Tae Se is doing everything.

1573
01:01:58,018 --> 01:01:59,448
Seok Jin rushes towards him.

1574
01:01:59,518 --> 01:02:01,818
Jong Tae Se passes the ball to Seok Jin. He's in the centre.

1575
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:03,348
- It's a header. - Seok Jin!

1576
01:02:03,418 --> 01:02:04,418
Goal!

1577
01:02:05,518 --> 01:02:07,248
Seok Jin is in the centre!

1578
01:02:07,248 --> 01:02:08,448
(He receives Tae Se's centering...)

1579
01:02:08,518 --> 01:02:09,848
(and ends it with a header.)

1580
01:02:28,448 --> 01:02:31,348
(Seok Jin is bad at most things.)

1581
01:02:31,418 --> 01:02:32,918
What are you doing?

1582
01:02:34,548 --> 01:02:38,418
(He always played the supporting character.)

1583
01:02:42,418 --> 01:02:45,778
(We hope he will score a goal...)

1584
01:02:45,848 --> 01:02:48,878
(and play the lead character this time.)

1585
01:02:50,048 --> 01:02:52,148
Seok Jin is in the centre!

1586
01:02:52,248 --> 01:02:53,778
- It's a header. - Seok Jin!

1587
01:02:53,848 --> 01:02:54,848
Wow!

1588
01:02:58,048 --> 01:03:01,948
(Will he become the leading character today?)

1589
01:03:03,048 --> 01:03:04,048
(It hits the goalpost.)

1590
01:03:05,718 --> 01:03:07,718
He gives it a try,

1591
01:03:07,778 --> 01:03:09,448
but it didn't go in.

1592
01:03:09,518 --> 01:03:13,048
What he did was a very hard thing to do.

1593
01:03:14,148 --> 01:03:18,848
(Everyone is amazed by Seok Jin's unexpected header.)

1594
01:03:20,048 --> 01:03:22,948
(He was so close to getting the spotlight.)

1595
01:03:23,018 --> 01:03:26,148
- He shot very well. - He was so close.

1596
01:03:26,148 --> 01:03:27,448
His head is on the ground.

1597
01:03:27,948 --> 01:03:29,748
It's too bad. He almost got it.

1598
01:03:30,048 --> 01:03:31,778
It's hard to even hit the ball with your head.

1599
01:03:32,048 --> 01:03:34,618
He was surrounded by defenders, and he jumped high alone.

1600
01:03:34,718 --> 01:03:36,948
If it went in, it would've been the goal of his life.

1601
01:03:37,148 --> 01:03:38,248
I thought he was going to score.

1602
01:03:38,348 --> 01:03:39,448
- Did you see that? - Yes.

1603
01:03:39,518 --> 01:03:40,648
I didn't know it was Seok Jin.

1604
01:03:40,718 --> 01:03:41,718
It's too bad.

1605
01:03:41,778 --> 01:03:43,018
I thought he was going to score.

1606
01:03:44,648 --> 01:03:47,448
Unfortunately, the goalkeeper blocked it well.

1607
01:03:48,348 --> 01:03:50,148
(Nearing the end, the Chinese team launches their last attack.)

1608
01:03:50,248 --> 01:03:54,018
The ball is passed to him. The Chinese team keeps trying.

1609
01:03:55,118 --> 01:03:56,148
They attack fast.

1610
01:03:56,148 --> 01:03:57,248
(He takes the ball away.)

1611
01:03:57,448 --> 01:03:58,818
- He took the ball. - Yes.

1612
01:03:58,878 --> 01:04:00,348
He took the ball and...

1613
01:04:00,448 --> 01:04:01,948
shoots.

1614
01:04:02,018 --> 01:04:03,248
- Okay. - Again.

1615
01:04:03,648 --> 01:04:05,618
- They almost scored. - Isn't that our ball now?

1616
01:04:05,648 --> 01:04:07,348
- Good job! - It is.

1617
01:04:07,448 --> 01:04:10,348
The goalkeeper did well.

1618
01:04:10,448 --> 01:04:11,448
Yes.

1619
01:04:11,648 --> 01:04:14,518
That was a good one.

1620
01:04:14,878 --> 01:04:16,518
- They keep doing well. - Yes.

1621
01:04:16,548 --> 01:04:17,978
(The Chinese team takes a corner kick.)

1622
01:04:18,548 --> 01:04:20,048
He passes it to his team.

1623
01:04:20,048 --> 01:04:22,018
The goalkeeper blocks it again. He defended well.

1624
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:27,148
Team Tae Se keeps earning points for the defence.

1625
01:04:27,418 --> 01:04:29,348
Our team needs to earn some points too.

1626
01:04:30,048 --> 01:04:31,048
Did you play?

1627
01:04:31,148 --> 01:04:33,048
- Did you play? - I did.

1628
01:04:34,518 --> 01:04:35,518
(Both teams do their best until the end.)

1629
01:04:35,548 --> 01:04:39,248
The Chinese team keeps getting chances to score.

1630
01:04:39,348 --> 01:04:41,918
The score is still 1 to 0.

1631
01:04:42,048 --> 01:04:43,978
The match is over.

1632
01:04:44,148 --> 01:04:47,248
The first half of...

1633
01:04:47,348 --> 01:04:49,048
2016 Running Man Champions League ends.

1634
01:04:49,918 --> 01:04:51,518
We didn't do well today.

1635
01:04:51,548 --> 01:04:53,548
Please give me another chance next year.

1636
01:04:53,648 --> 01:04:55,648
You were so...

1637
01:04:56,978 --> 01:04:59,248
- Good job. - You were amazing.

1638
01:04:59,348 --> 01:05:03,418
(The football legends and members of Running Man played together.)

1639
01:05:05,448 --> 01:05:09,048
(Meeting with each other was more meaningful than winning.)

1640
01:05:09,148 --> 01:05:10,248
Good job, everyone.

1641
01:05:10,248 --> 01:05:11,818
(Running Man)

1642
01:05:11,978 --> 01:05:13,018
Tae Se!

1643
01:05:13,048 --> 01:05:15,778
(Everyone becomes a child when you play football.)

1644
01:05:15,848 --> 01:05:18,148
The Korean All Stars team won,

1645
01:05:18,148 --> 01:05:20,148
and the 90-minute match ended.

1646
01:05:20,148 --> 01:05:22,248
(The first half of Running Man Champions League is over.)

1647
01:05:22,348 --> 01:05:25,418
The game will be followed by the second half of the league.

1648
01:05:25,448 --> 01:05:27,248
Now,

1649
01:05:27,348 --> 01:05:31,348
Team So Yun and Team Tae Se each earned three points.

1650
01:05:31,418 --> 01:05:33,148
Team Ji Sung didn't do well today.

1651
01:05:33,248 --> 01:05:36,148
We will keep our eyes on the scores in the second half.

1652
01:05:36,248 --> 01:05:38,248
- We will watch them. - Yes. Team Ji Sung has...

1653
01:05:38,348 --> 01:05:40,518
a chance to turn things around in the second half.

1654
01:05:40,548 --> 01:05:41,618
Yes.

1655
01:05:41,648 --> 01:05:43,048
(What kind of mission is awaiting in the second half?)

1656
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:44,518
By the way, was that a football game...

1657
01:05:44,548 --> 01:05:45,878
or a variety show?

1658
01:05:48,048 --> 01:05:49,048
Football variety show.

1659
01:05:49,248 --> 01:05:50,448
- A football variety show? - A football variety show.

1660
01:05:55,348 --> 01:05:57,148
- It's Tae Se's baby. - It's Tae Se's baby.

1661
01:05:57,248 --> 01:05:58,948
It's Tae Se's baby.

1662
01:05:59,248 --> 01:06:00,248
- Come here. - What's wrong with his nose?

1663
01:06:00,348 --> 01:06:02,348
- He fell. - He's so adorable.

1664
01:06:02,418 --> 01:06:03,848
He looks like Tae Se.

1665
01:06:04,048 --> 01:06:05,918
- He must've fallen. - He's cute.

1666
01:06:05,978 --> 01:06:07,548
(He has a wound on his nose.)

1667
01:06:07,618 --> 01:06:08,648
This is Tae Se's son.

1668
01:06:08,718 --> 01:06:11,548
He's Tae Se's son.

1669
01:06:11,878 --> 01:06:13,918
- His name is Tae Ju. - Tae Ju.

1670
01:06:14,148 --> 01:06:15,548
He's adorable.

1671
01:06:15,748 --> 01:06:18,878
- Il Woo is here. - Il Woo is here today.

1672
01:06:19,548 --> 01:06:20,718
I will do my best.

1673
01:06:21,148 --> 01:06:22,718
He's so competitive.

1674
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:24,018
He is very strong.

1675
01:06:24,048 --> 01:06:25,548
(Il Woo is on Team So Yun.)

1676
01:06:28,248 --> 01:06:29,878
Next is Kim Jae Sung.

1677
01:06:29,948 --> 01:06:32,048
(Kim Jae Sung is the midfielder of Korea's national football team.)

1678
01:06:32,148 --> 01:06:33,978
And we have Han Kook Young.

1679
01:06:34,048 --> 01:06:35,818
(Han Kook Young is the midfielder of Korea's national football team.)

1680
01:06:35,878 --> 01:06:38,048
We have Kim Dong Jin as well.

1681
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:39,918
(Kim Dong Jin is the defender of Korea's national football team.)

1682
01:06:40,348 --> 01:06:42,918
Is there a member among us that you resent from earlier?

1683
01:06:42,978 --> 01:06:44,348
- Who did you secretly resent? - The one...

1684
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:46,418
- standing at the end, Kwang Soo. - Me?

1685
01:06:47,148 --> 01:06:50,548
- Me? - Usually guys can play football.

1686
01:06:51,418 --> 01:06:53,148
But I am really bad at it. I am in big trouble.

1687
01:06:53,248 --> 01:06:55,848
Why did the director...

1688
01:06:55,918 --> 01:06:58,418
let Kwang Soo play for such a long time?

1689
01:06:58,448 --> 01:07:00,648
Since he's tall, we thought he was going to play well.

1690
01:07:00,718 --> 01:07:01,878
But he was terrible.

1691
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:04,148
(The national team coach is frank.)

1692
01:07:04,248 --> 01:07:06,018
Isn't that too harsh?

1693
01:07:06,048 --> 01:07:07,848
Gosh.

1694
01:07:08,148 --> 01:07:12,848
(The members have been chosen for each team.)

1695
01:07:12,918 --> 01:07:14,748
The mission for the second half is called...

1696
01:07:14,818 --> 01:07:16,448
Strategic Name Tag Ripping.

1697
01:07:16,548 --> 01:07:17,548
Strategic?

1698
01:07:18,348 --> 01:07:22,348
Starting now, the three teams will be dispersed into headquarters.

1699
01:07:22,818 --> 01:07:25,348
And you will assign a number from 1 to 5 to each member...

1700
01:07:25,518 --> 01:07:28,648
and put the number in the name tag.

1701
01:07:28,718 --> 01:07:30,448
We will probably be paired.

1702
01:07:30,778 --> 01:07:31,778
I am worried about this.

1703
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:35,148
I think Jong Kook has the last number.

1704
01:07:35,148 --> 01:07:36,248
(Team So Yun)

1705
01:07:36,348 --> 01:07:38,348
I am worried because my number is in the middle.

1706
01:07:38,548 --> 01:07:39,918
Let's start.

1707
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:41,848
Okay.

1708
01:07:41,918 --> 01:07:43,048
(Team Ji Sung)

1709
01:07:44,148 --> 01:07:45,148
I'm number one.

1710
01:07:45,418 --> 01:07:46,418
And...

1711
01:07:46,448 --> 01:07:47,778
- I'm number four. - For example,

1712
01:07:47,848 --> 01:07:50,878
if your number is three,

1713
01:07:51,148 --> 01:07:54,148
you can only attack the person...

1714
01:07:54,248 --> 01:07:55,648
with the same number as yours.

1715
01:07:55,748 --> 01:07:57,048
How can we know what their numbers are?

1716
01:07:57,548 --> 01:08:00,148
- That's tough. - If you attack the person...

1717
01:08:00,548 --> 01:08:03,148
with a wrong number, you will receive a yellow card.

1718
01:08:03,418 --> 01:08:05,778
If you make another mistake and receive another yellow card,

1719
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:07,948
you will receive a red card and get kicked out of the game.

1720
01:08:09,048 --> 01:08:10,718
Are there hints then?

1721
01:08:10,778 --> 01:08:11,978
There are hints, of course.

1722
01:08:12,248 --> 01:08:14,148
There are hints in the boxes hidden around in this building.

1723
01:08:14,248 --> 01:08:16,348
With those hints, you can guess people's numbers.

1724
01:08:16,548 --> 01:08:19,748
In the first half, your team got...

1725
01:08:19,818 --> 01:08:21,418
points for attacking and defending.

1726
01:08:21,718 --> 01:08:23,748
Team So Yun earned three points in total.

1727
01:08:23,818 --> 01:08:24,818
Bravo.

1728
01:08:25,148 --> 01:08:27,948
Team Tae Se gets three points too.

1729
01:08:28,778 --> 01:08:30,048
- That's good. - We're the only team...

1730
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:31,148
We don't have any points?

1731
01:08:31,248 --> 01:08:32,918
Team Ji Sung...

1732
01:08:33,248 --> 01:08:34,718
played hard.

1733
01:08:35,348 --> 01:08:36,878
(That's it?)

1734
01:08:36,948 --> 01:08:38,018
You played hard.

1735
01:08:38,048 --> 01:08:39,618
We have zero point.

1736
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:43,448
Team So Yun and Team Tae Se get three chances.

1737
01:08:44,248 --> 01:08:48,018
Team Ji Sung still gets one chance.

1738
01:08:48,648 --> 01:08:49,648
We will at least give you one.

1739
01:08:49,848 --> 01:08:51,448
The most dangerous one is Team Tae Se.

1740
01:08:51,548 --> 01:08:52,548
- Right. - It's because...

1741
01:08:52,648 --> 01:08:55,148
Jong Kook is in his team.

1742
01:08:55,248 --> 01:08:57,148
Team Tae Se will be very aggressive.

1743
01:08:57,248 --> 01:08:59,848
I know. We choose Team Tae Se.

1744
01:09:00,048 --> 01:09:02,418
It's randomly chosen.

1745
01:09:02,448 --> 01:09:03,848
I picked that one too.

1746
01:09:04,748 --> 01:09:07,588
Please, Tae Se.

1747
01:09:09,218 --> 01:09:10,378
- Who is it? - Seok Jin.

1748
01:09:10,978 --> 01:09:13,478
- Come on. - Seok Jin is number four.

1749
01:09:13,978 --> 01:09:15,348
- Is Seok Jin number four? - Yes.

1750
01:09:16,478 --> 01:09:18,418
Are you usually lucky with these?

1751
01:09:18,478 --> 01:09:20,588
Jae Seok is usually lucky this these.

1752
01:09:21,148 --> 01:09:23,048
- It's Il Woo. - It's number three.

1753
01:09:23,088 --> 01:09:24,088
(Jung Il Woo, number three)

1754
01:09:24,178 --> 01:09:26,778
- It's your number. - He doesn't know his own number.

1755
01:09:27,418 --> 01:09:29,048
(Jong Kook versus Il Woo)

1756
01:09:29,088 --> 01:09:30,218
- That's good. - You can win.

1757
01:09:30,278 --> 01:09:31,448
- You can win. - We can do it.

1758
01:09:31,778 --> 01:09:33,148
Because I can pick one.

1759
01:09:33,218 --> 01:09:34,678
- It's number five. - It's Haha.

1760
01:09:34,978 --> 01:09:36,588
Haha is a good opponent.

1761
01:09:36,588 --> 01:09:38,148
- It's good. - Yes.

1762
01:09:38,218 --> 01:09:39,878
(Kwang Soo versus Haha)

1763
01:09:39,878 --> 01:09:41,148
That's good.

1764
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:43,048
It looks like we'll win today.

1765
01:09:43,088 --> 01:09:44,548
(Who will be the last one?)

1766
01:09:44,588 --> 01:09:46,048
- It's Jae Seok. - He's number four.

1767
01:09:46,088 --> 01:09:48,678
- Okay. - Shall we help him?

1768
01:09:48,778 --> 01:09:49,778
I have to help him.

1769
01:09:50,948 --> 01:09:52,218
- Oh, gosh. - Oh, goodness.

1770
01:09:52,278 --> 01:09:53,848
- What's wrong? - It's Seok Jin.

1771
01:09:53,878 --> 01:09:55,278
(Jee Seok Jin, number four)

1772
01:09:55,348 --> 01:09:57,248
Why did you pick him?

1773
01:09:57,588 --> 01:09:58,778
Il Woo is really unlucky.

1774
01:09:59,318 --> 01:10:00,378
(He's as unlucky as Kwang Soo.)

1775
01:10:00,478 --> 01:10:01,878
- Come on. - This is bad.

1776
01:10:02,248 --> 01:10:03,588
Come on.

1777
01:10:03,778 --> 01:10:04,778
- Wow. - Tae Se.

1778
01:10:04,878 --> 01:10:06,678
(Jong Tae Se, number one)

1779
01:10:06,778 --> 01:10:08,278
Can you catch him?

1780
01:10:10,318 --> 01:10:11,318
- Who is it? - Kim Dong Jin.

1781
01:10:11,848 --> 01:10:13,088
(So Yun versus Tae Se versus Dong Jin)

1782
01:10:13,678 --> 01:10:15,278
How will I do this?

1783
01:10:15,418 --> 01:10:17,248
I'll give you a cell phone.

1784
01:10:17,318 --> 01:10:19,588
You can send text messages to...

1785
01:10:19,678 --> 01:10:22,278
your teammates to share your strategies.

1786
01:10:22,348 --> 01:10:26,378
You can upload your status on SNS to share...

1787
01:10:26,678 --> 01:10:28,088
information with your team.

1788
01:10:28,178 --> 01:10:29,178
- That's great. - That's awesome.

1789
01:10:31,178 --> 01:10:33,088
(The second half of Running Man Champions League starts now.)

1790
01:10:33,148 --> 01:10:35,178
Let's go search the fourth floor first.

1791
01:10:35,678 --> 01:10:37,418
I'm bad at searching.

1792
01:10:37,878 --> 01:10:39,478
It should be here.

1793
01:10:40,588 --> 01:10:41,878
I don't think so.

1794
01:10:42,678 --> 01:10:44,218
Let's check.

1795
01:10:45,088 --> 01:10:46,678
I think there should be a box here somewhere.

1796
01:10:47,318 --> 01:10:48,588
I'm bad at searching for things.

1797
01:10:54,218 --> 01:10:56,088
(He found a box.)

1798
01:10:58,778 --> 01:11:01,088
(Jong Kook: Subtract scissors from paper.)

1799
01:11:01,848 --> 01:11:04,348
(He saves the picture...)

1800
01:11:04,418 --> 01:11:06,378
(and rips the clue.)

1801
01:11:06,978 --> 01:11:08,348
(Ji Sung is smart.)

1802
01:11:08,418 --> 01:11:09,478
I found one.

1803
01:11:09,878 --> 01:11:11,378
It says "Subtract scissors from paper".

1804
01:11:11,978 --> 01:11:13,878
- Subtract scissors. - It's three.

1805
01:11:13,948 --> 01:11:14,978
(Jong Kook is number three.)

1806
01:11:16,588 --> 01:11:18,478
- Let's go faster. - We have to watch our backs.

1807
01:11:19,148 --> 01:11:20,588
They could surprise us from behind.

1808
01:11:21,048 --> 01:11:22,588
That's why we have to catch them one by one.

1809
01:11:23,278 --> 01:11:26,088
We have to get Haha no matter what.

1810
01:11:26,978 --> 01:11:28,048
- You have Haha, right? - Yes.

1811
01:11:28,378 --> 01:11:30,088
You have to get Haha.

1812
01:11:35,588 --> 01:11:39,978
(Kwang Soo and Haha are about to meet.)

1813
01:11:41,318 --> 01:11:43,878
(I've been waiting for you.)

1814
01:11:44,548 --> 01:11:46,378
- That's not it. - I'll take this.

1815
01:11:46,448 --> 01:11:48,478
- Okay. - It's number five.

1816
01:11:48,588 --> 01:11:49,588
(As soon as I saw your number,)

1817
01:11:50,318 --> 01:11:51,978
(I knew I would win.)

1818
01:11:52,088 --> 01:11:53,248
- That's great. - He's an easy target.

1819
01:11:53,278 --> 01:11:54,548
- He'll win. - It'll be easy.

1820
01:11:54,588 --> 01:11:55,588
(Haha is coming to Kwang Soo.)

1821
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:57,318
I need to know the number first.

1822
01:11:57,588 --> 01:11:58,878
- Isn't it me? - What?

1823
01:12:00,088 --> 01:12:01,778
My team picked your team.

1824
01:12:01,848 --> 01:12:04,318
(Kwang Soo slowly approaches Haha.)

1825
01:12:05,588 --> 01:12:07,448
(Haha is right in front of us.)

1826
01:12:08,088 --> 01:12:09,878
(They know my back number.)

1827
01:12:09,878 --> 01:12:10,978
Wait.

1828
01:12:11,218 --> 01:12:12,278
(Run!)

1829
01:12:16,588 --> 01:12:19,448
(Haha runs as fast as he can.)

1830
01:12:19,478 --> 01:12:21,778
- He's fast. - He's too fast.

1831
01:12:22,348 --> 01:12:24,848
Catch him. You have to catch him.

1832
01:12:26,048 --> 01:12:27,178
No. Wait.

1833
01:12:27,948 --> 01:12:28,978
(Kwang Soo gets Haha.)

1834
01:12:29,088 --> 01:12:31,588
You can't do this. Not yet.

1835
01:12:32,878 --> 01:12:34,148
Come on. Really?

1836
01:12:35,588 --> 01:12:37,248
You're number five!

1837
01:12:37,318 --> 01:12:38,348
Are you number five?

1838
01:12:39,218 --> 01:12:40,678
You run faster than I expected.

1839
01:12:44,178 --> 01:12:46,678
(Haha is out.)

1840
01:12:47,048 --> 01:12:48,148
Haha is out.

1841
01:12:48,218 --> 01:12:49,278
(Haha is out.)

1842
01:12:49,348 --> 01:12:50,588
Haha is out.

1843
01:12:51,348 --> 01:12:52,378
What?

1844
01:12:55,348 --> 01:12:57,218
Where is Jae Seok?

1845
01:12:58,088 --> 01:12:59,948
- Haha is out. - Why?

1846
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:01,478
Haha is out.

1847
01:13:01,478 --> 01:13:02,878
(Why?)

1848
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:04,048
Who ripped it?

1849
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:06,848
The jail is not even set up yet.

1850
01:13:07,448 --> 01:13:09,148
I can't believe I'm already out.

1851
01:13:09,878 --> 01:13:11,588
This is unbelievable.

1852
01:13:11,678 --> 01:13:13,088
They got me as soon as the game started.

1853
01:13:13,678 --> 01:13:15,848
I didn't think I'd be the first one.

1854
01:13:20,378 --> 01:13:21,448
(I won't play any more.)

1855
01:13:21,478 --> 01:13:23,778
Hey, who ripped it? Do you know?

1856
01:13:24,088 --> 01:13:26,848
- Who got Haha? - We need to know.

1857
01:13:26,878 --> 01:13:29,218
I think Team Ji Hyo did it.

1858
01:13:29,848 --> 01:13:31,148
Let me know if you want to share information.

1859
01:13:31,218 --> 01:13:33,088
- We have three chances. - Did you...

1860
01:13:33,148 --> 01:13:34,878
- get Haha? - Did you get Haha?

1861
01:13:34,948 --> 01:13:35,978
It wasn't my team.

1862
01:13:36,088 --> 01:13:37,478
Can we work together?

1863
01:13:37,588 --> 01:13:38,978
- On this floor... - Yes, we can.

1864
01:13:39,048 --> 01:13:40,088
We have to get them too.

1865
01:13:40,178 --> 01:13:42,778
Kwang Soo took Haha out.

1866
01:13:42,848 --> 01:13:44,978
I see. What number is Kwang Soo?

1867
01:13:45,048 --> 01:13:47,978
- He is... - Kwang Soo is...

1868
01:13:48,088 --> 01:13:49,088
- Okay. - I got it.

1869
01:13:49,148 --> 01:13:51,148
It doesn't matter if...

1870
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:53,148
we share Kwang Soo's...

1871
01:13:53,218 --> 01:13:54,548
- number, does it? - Right.

1872
01:13:54,588 --> 01:13:56,478
- Okay. - We can.

1873
01:13:56,588 --> 01:13:57,678
Let's share Kwang Soo's number.

1874
01:13:57,778 --> 01:14:00,048
- I'll give you information too. - Sure.

1875
01:14:00,048 --> 01:14:01,088
We'll tell you.

1876
01:14:01,148 --> 01:14:03,088
Kwang Soo is number five.

1877
01:14:03,148 --> 01:14:04,178
- Is he? - Yes, he's number five.

1878
01:14:04,248 --> 01:14:05,318
You have to tell us something.

1879
01:14:05,678 --> 01:14:07,588
Tae Se is number one.

1880
01:14:07,878 --> 01:14:08,878
(Tae Se 1, Seok Jin 4, Kwang Soo 5)

1881
01:14:08,948 --> 01:14:10,178
That's good.

1882
01:14:10,848 --> 01:14:11,878
- Was that information good enough? - Let's go.

1883
01:14:12,048 --> 01:14:14,148
- Was that information good enough? - Someone's here.

1884
01:14:14,218 --> 01:14:15,248
(Did you just tell them my number?)

1885
01:14:15,318 --> 01:14:17,418
- I heard that. - Wait a minute.

1886
01:14:17,478 --> 01:14:18,588
I just heard her say something.

1887
01:14:18,678 --> 01:14:20,678
- Come on. - They're sharing numbers.

1888
01:14:20,678 --> 01:14:22,278
What were you talking about?

1889
01:14:22,348 --> 01:14:24,448
What was that about? Come on.

1890
01:14:24,548 --> 01:14:27,148
- Are you helping each other? - They're together.

1891
01:14:27,218 --> 01:14:29,178
Are you allies?

1892
01:14:29,278 --> 01:14:30,418
- Come on. - We need to know them.

1893
01:14:30,478 --> 01:14:31,948
(A war is about to break out.)

1894
01:14:32,478 --> 01:14:33,478
- Il Woo, you too? - Come on.

1895
01:14:33,588 --> 01:14:34,848
- Watch your back. - Watch your back.

1896
01:14:34,878 --> 01:14:36,088
- Wait. - Come on.

1897
01:14:38,678 --> 01:14:41,588
(Tae Young attacks.)

1898
01:14:44,088 --> 01:14:45,588
- Stop. - Hey.

1899
01:14:45,588 --> 01:14:47,848
- Come here. - Come here.

1900
01:14:47,878 --> 01:14:49,778
- Stop. - Come here.

1901
01:14:49,848 --> 01:14:51,048
- Be careful. - Stop.

1902
01:14:51,088 --> 01:14:53,878
- Hey, get out. - No.

1903
01:14:54,978 --> 01:14:56,048
Help me.

1904
01:14:56,678 --> 01:14:57,948
(Tae Se rips Gary's name tag.)

1905
01:14:57,978 --> 01:15:00,588
- Help me. - Hold him.

1906
01:15:00,678 --> 01:15:01,778
Wait.

1907
01:15:01,878 --> 01:15:03,048
Help me.

1908
01:15:03,088 --> 01:15:04,248
(Jae Seok rips Seok Jin's name tag.)

1909
01:15:04,278 --> 01:15:07,088
- Hey. - Help me.

1910
01:15:07,148 --> 01:15:08,178
You're out.

1911
01:15:10,848 --> 01:15:12,148
Oh, goodness.

1912
01:15:13,978 --> 01:15:16,088
(Ji Hyo is my enemy too.)

1913
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,418
Hey.

1914
01:15:17,478 --> 01:15:19,478
- Wait. - Stop.

1915
01:15:19,588 --> 01:15:22,478
- Jee Seok Jin is out. - Are you out?

1916
01:15:22,478 --> 01:15:24,348
- Yes. - Who got you?

1917
01:15:24,418 --> 01:15:25,478
Jae Seok did.

1918
01:15:25,978 --> 01:15:27,678
Seok Jin should be here soon.

1919
01:15:28,588 --> 01:15:30,278
I'm so lonely.

1920
01:15:30,978 --> 01:15:32,418
- Jee Seok Jin is out. - That's it.

1921
01:15:32,478 --> 01:15:33,478
(That's it.)

1922
01:15:33,588 --> 01:15:35,778
I told you so. I knew he'd be out soon.

1923
01:15:36,178 --> 01:15:37,378
Why is Gary's name tag missing?

1924
01:15:37,778 --> 01:15:38,978
Tae Se ripped it.

1925
01:15:39,278 --> 01:15:41,448
- Do you have the same number? - I don't know.

1926
01:15:41,588 --> 01:15:47,148
(Why did Tae Se attack Gary?)

1927
01:15:47,978 --> 01:15:49,878
- Okay. - Let's rip the name tag...

1928
01:15:50,148 --> 01:15:52,088
of a strong player...

1929
01:15:52,148 --> 01:15:53,478
to find out his number and...

1930
01:15:53,588 --> 01:15:54,978
- receive a yellow card. - Then let's share the number.

1931
01:15:55,478 --> 01:15:56,778
- Go that way. - Hey!

1932
01:15:56,848 --> 01:15:58,378
(Tae Se waits for a chance.)

1933
01:15:58,448 --> 01:16:04,148
(He runs toward Gary and rips his name tag off.)

1934
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:08,448
(Unless you rip the name tag of the same number, you get a yellow card.)

1935
01:16:08,478 --> 01:16:10,588
- Tae Se gets a yellow card. - Really?

1936
01:16:11,088 --> 01:16:12,248
Does he get a yellow card?

1937
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:14,348
(Both teams now know Gary's number.)

1938
01:16:14,978 --> 01:16:17,478
(Tae Se gets a yellow card.)

1939
01:16:18,678 --> 01:16:22,478
(Haha and Seok Jin are out.)

1940
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:24,778
- Me and you... - Wait.

1941
01:16:24,878 --> 01:16:27,478
- What about Ji Sung? - Ji Sung must be number three.

1942
01:16:27,588 --> 01:16:29,448
- That's right. - He's number three.

1943
01:16:30,588 --> 01:16:32,378
- I'll get Ji Sung. - Okay.

1944
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:33,588
Il Woo.

1945
01:16:33,588 --> 01:16:34,878
(Overzealous)

1946
01:16:34,878 --> 01:16:36,418
(He is as passionate as he was in the past.)

1947
01:16:36,418 --> 01:16:37,418
What?

1948
01:16:37,478 --> 01:16:38,478
Calm down.

1949
01:16:39,248 --> 01:16:40,278
We need to think.

1950
01:16:40,778 --> 01:16:41,778
I think...

1951
01:16:42,178 --> 01:16:43,278
I know all their numbers.

1952
01:16:43,778 --> 01:16:45,088
Ji Hyo is number four.

1953
01:16:45,678 --> 01:16:47,248
She tried to get me.

1954
01:16:47,588 --> 01:16:49,448
- Tae Se is number 1. - Tae Se is number 1.

1955
01:16:49,478 --> 01:16:52,278
Tae Se is number 1 and Kwang Soo is number 5.

1956
01:16:52,348 --> 01:16:53,878
Seok Jin is number four and I took him out.

1957
01:16:54,178 --> 01:16:56,088
- Who's number 2? - So number 2 is Tae Young.

1958
01:16:56,588 --> 01:16:58,478
- Come here. - Let's go.

1959
01:16:59,588 --> 01:17:00,588
Let's go.

1960
01:17:00,878 --> 01:17:05,178
(Tae Se found out that Gary's number is five.)

1961
01:17:06,218 --> 01:17:08,088
(My target right now is Gary.)

1962
01:17:10,678 --> 01:17:12,048
Wait, wait.

1963
01:17:12,088 --> 01:17:13,148
Wait a minute.

1964
01:17:13,678 --> 01:17:16,878
How did you know my number? Okay!

1965
01:17:16,948 --> 01:17:19,088
(Jong Kook is coming.)

1966
01:17:24,778 --> 01:17:27,278
(Tae Young holds Gary.)

1967
01:17:30,588 --> 01:17:33,278
(Kwang Soo takes Gary's tag off.)

1968
01:17:34,348 --> 01:17:36,218
(Gary is out.)

1969
01:17:36,778 --> 01:17:37,878
Gary is out.

1970
01:17:37,978 --> 01:17:38,978
Come on, guys.

1971
01:17:39,088 --> 01:17:40,348
Gary is out.

1972
01:17:41,848 --> 01:17:42,948
Gary!

1973
01:17:44,178 --> 01:17:45,278
He's out.

1974
01:17:46,088 --> 01:17:47,878
Gary is out.

1975
01:17:47,978 --> 01:17:50,048
(Oh, no!)

1976
01:17:52,448 --> 01:17:54,248
I got all the fives.

1977
01:17:56,678 --> 01:17:58,478
I'm doing so much better in the second half.

1978
01:17:58,588 --> 01:17:59,588
(He's proud of himself.)

1979
01:17:59,678 --> 01:18:01,878
Shouldn't you change your number? now?

1980
01:18:01,978 --> 01:18:03,248
Yes, I should.

1981
01:18:03,318 --> 01:18:05,418
You take this number.

1982
01:18:05,478 --> 01:18:06,478
(Can they change numbers?)

1983
01:18:07,278 --> 01:18:08,418
There's an important rule.

1984
01:18:08,478 --> 01:18:10,588
- Yes. - Let's say Ji Sung is number one...

1985
01:18:10,678 --> 01:18:12,978
and he took out the all the other number ones.

1986
01:18:13,048 --> 01:18:15,678
Then Ji Sung can change his number...

1987
01:18:15,778 --> 01:18:18,088
to whatever he wants since he's the only number one.

1988
01:18:18,148 --> 01:18:19,588
- I see. - Do you understand?

1989
01:18:19,978 --> 01:18:21,978
- There are 2 number 3s. - I see.

1990
01:18:22,048 --> 01:18:23,088
(What's Kwang Soo's new number?)

1991
01:18:23,178 --> 01:18:25,478
- Good. - That's right.

1992
01:18:25,588 --> 01:18:27,588
- Okay. - Let them get your name tag.

1993
01:18:27,678 --> 01:18:30,088
- Got it? - Okay.

1994
01:18:30,378 --> 01:18:31,378
Hurry up.

1995
01:18:31,678 --> 01:18:32,978
We can't get Kwang Soo.

1996
01:18:33,048 --> 01:18:34,178
- Let's go down. - Let's go down.

1997
01:18:34,248 --> 01:18:35,478
We should go down.

1998
01:18:36,148 --> 01:18:37,178
Let's go.

1999
01:18:37,248 --> 01:18:40,378
(Nobody knows Kwang Soo's number.)

2000
01:18:41,478 --> 01:18:43,588
- Let's go. - I'm not afraid of anything.

2001
01:18:44,878 --> 01:18:45,948
(I will have my revenge.)

2002
01:18:45,978 --> 01:18:47,348
You made fun of me in the first half.

2003
01:18:47,678 --> 01:18:49,678
Get him. Let's take him.

2004
01:18:49,778 --> 01:18:51,088
We'll just get a yellow card.

2005
01:18:51,148 --> 01:18:52,588
- No, he's number five. - I'm...

2006
01:18:52,678 --> 01:18:54,418
- Wait. - He's alone right now.

2007
01:18:54,548 --> 01:18:55,588
Hold on.

2008
01:18:55,618 --> 01:18:57,278
(Why are you doing this?)

2009
01:18:57,348 --> 01:18:59,348
- Hold on. - Come here.

2010
01:18:59,418 --> 01:19:00,848
- Hold on. - Come here.

2011
01:19:00,878 --> 01:19:02,378
- Why aren't they coming? - Hey!

2012
01:19:02,448 --> 01:19:04,088
- Wait. - Hey.

2013
01:19:04,818 --> 01:19:06,778
Do you know how many people...

2014
01:19:06,878 --> 01:19:08,118
How could you do this to us?

2015
01:19:08,178 --> 01:19:09,548
He deserves a yellow card.

2016
01:19:09,588 --> 01:19:10,978
Do you really not know?

2017
01:19:11,218 --> 01:19:14,378
- My number... - What if your number gets revealed?

2018
01:19:14,678 --> 01:19:16,378
I won't look. I'll just go.

2019
01:19:16,478 --> 01:19:18,588
Then tell us one of your team member's number.

2020
01:19:18,778 --> 01:19:20,218
- I'm number five. - No, what we want to know is...

2021
01:19:20,278 --> 01:19:21,748
Who's number two?

2022
01:19:21,878 --> 01:19:24,178
We know that's not true.

2023
01:19:24,448 --> 01:19:25,778
Your team...

2024
01:19:25,848 --> 01:19:27,088
abandoned you.

2025
01:19:27,178 --> 01:19:28,448
Why isn't anyone coming to help?

2026
01:19:29,478 --> 01:19:30,548
Hey!

2027
01:19:31,678 --> 01:19:35,218
(They're using members as bait to track the other team.)

2028
01:19:35,778 --> 01:19:37,118
I can hear Team Ji Sung.

2029
01:19:38,478 --> 01:19:39,918
- He's number five. - Do I tell you what number I am?

2030
01:19:40,048 --> 01:19:41,848
But this will change his number.

2031
01:19:41,918 --> 01:19:43,178
But we don't know if it changed yet.

2032
01:19:43,218 --> 01:19:44,478
- Did he change his number? - Now it's changed.

2033
01:19:44,588 --> 01:19:45,678
That's right.

2034
01:19:45,778 --> 01:19:47,848
I'll just check it.

2035
01:19:48,678 --> 01:19:50,478
- All right. - Because if we don't...

2036
01:19:50,548 --> 01:19:52,018
Wait! Wait a minute!

2037
01:19:52,088 --> 01:19:53,778
If you're not the same number...

2038
01:19:53,848 --> 01:19:55,278
Let's take his name tag off.

2039
01:19:55,318 --> 01:19:57,818
- Okay! - Let's take his name tag off.

2040
01:19:57,878 --> 01:19:59,818
- Do it. - He's number three.

2041
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:01,178
(I'm also number three.)

2042
01:20:01,218 --> 01:20:02,818
You're out!

2043
01:20:02,878 --> 01:20:04,278
I'm number three!

2044
01:20:04,918 --> 01:20:05,978
What?

2045
01:20:06,048 --> 01:20:07,178
(Ji Sung was also number three.)

2046
01:20:07,218 --> 01:20:08,278
He's out.

2047
01:20:08,318 --> 01:20:10,978
(Ji Sung's in luck.)

2048
01:20:11,048 --> 01:20:13,378
We've got him.

2049
01:20:13,588 --> 01:20:15,178
You're out now.

2050
01:20:15,278 --> 01:20:16,948
Is this for real?

2051
01:20:17,478 --> 01:20:18,918
We did it.

2052
01:20:19,588 --> 01:20:20,748
Kwang Soo is out?

2053
01:20:21,178 --> 01:20:22,278
What?

2054
01:20:22,748 --> 01:20:23,748
Kwang Soo is out?

2055
01:20:23,848 --> 01:20:25,118
Goodbye, Kwang Soo!

2056
01:20:25,178 --> 01:20:26,318
You can go now.

2057
01:20:26,678 --> 01:20:27,978
Go away, Kwang Soo.

2058
01:20:28,048 --> 01:20:29,278
(So unlucky of him to be tagged out)

2059
01:20:29,318 --> 01:20:30,478
Goodbye, Kwang Soo!

2060
01:20:30,548 --> 01:20:31,678
How could this happen?

2061
01:20:32,478 --> 01:20:34,318
- Kwang Soo! - How could he be number three?

2062
01:20:36,118 --> 01:20:37,478
Who tagged you out?

2063
01:20:37,848 --> 01:20:39,088
- Kwang Soo, - Ji Sung ripped it off.

2064
01:20:39,588 --> 01:20:40,978
you really have no luck.

2065
01:20:41,048 --> 01:20:42,088
Why did you follow us?

2066
01:20:42,478 --> 01:20:45,588
That was so lucky of us to have taken Kwang Soo out.

2067
01:20:46,018 --> 01:20:47,178
They have three people left?

2068
01:20:47,318 --> 01:20:48,548
(Checking Tae Se's location)

2069
01:20:48,588 --> 01:20:51,048
They're so strong.

2070
01:20:51,978 --> 01:20:53,178
Jae Sung...

2071
01:20:53,278 --> 01:20:54,848
(Tae Se, let's move!)

2072
01:20:55,818 --> 01:20:58,278
(Thanks to Kwang Soo, they now know Ji Sung is number three.)

2073
01:20:58,318 --> 01:21:01,218
(Jong Kook will target Ji Sung.)

2074
01:21:01,278 --> 01:21:02,448
Who?

2075
01:21:07,588 --> 01:21:10,048
(Tae Se is coming nearer to help Jong Kook out.)

2076
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:15,178
What's this?

2077
01:21:15,548 --> 01:21:18,088
(Now is the time!)

2078
01:21:19,748 --> 01:21:20,848
Oh, no!

2079
01:21:22,748 --> 01:21:23,878
(Ji Sung takes off Jong Kook's name tag.)

2080
01:21:25,318 --> 01:21:27,118
What is this?

2081
01:21:27,178 --> 01:21:28,918
(Ji Sung catches Jong Kook.)

2082
01:21:28,978 --> 01:21:30,778
Yes! We did it!

2083
01:21:30,848 --> 01:21:32,848
(They can't believe they caught Jong Kook.)

2084
01:21:35,178 --> 01:21:36,218
(Jong Kook blames Tae Se.)

2085
01:21:36,818 --> 01:21:38,218
It's your fault!

2086
01:21:38,278 --> 01:21:39,588
(Jong Kook is out.)

2087
01:21:40,278 --> 01:21:42,218
There is Jae Sung.

2088
01:21:42,278 --> 01:21:43,448
Ji Hyo and So Yun.

2089
01:21:43,588 --> 01:21:44,878
Ji Hyo is...

2090
01:21:45,048 --> 01:21:46,648
Wait. What's this?

2091
01:21:46,678 --> 01:21:48,378
We're very edgy at the moment.

2092
01:21:48,778 --> 01:21:49,878
We might elbow you.

2093
01:21:50,878 --> 01:21:52,178
If we catch two of Team Tae Se,

2094
01:21:52,678 --> 01:21:53,818
then only Team So Yun will be left.

2095
01:21:53,878 --> 01:21:55,218
There are two girls on that team.

2096
01:21:55,478 --> 01:21:56,818
We have the upper hand against them.

2097
01:21:57,378 --> 01:21:58,478
Where are they?

2098
01:22:01,218 --> 01:22:03,278
Come over here.

2099
01:22:03,818 --> 01:22:06,588
I'll hold Ji Sung, you tag him out.

2100
01:22:07,118 --> 01:22:09,918
I'll hold Ji Sung, you tag him out.

2101
01:22:10,478 --> 01:22:13,378
(So I'm the target?)

2102
01:22:16,088 --> 01:22:17,588
Come over here, Tae Se.

2103
01:22:17,678 --> 01:22:20,318
(Ji Sung tries to help Dong Jin by tackling Tae Se.)

2104
01:22:20,378 --> 01:22:22,588
Come over here, Tae Se.

2105
01:22:23,678 --> 01:22:25,318
Tae Se, come here.

2106
01:22:25,378 --> 01:22:26,778
Let's go.

2107
01:22:26,848 --> 01:22:27,878
I can't see!

2108
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:36,018
(So Yun gets Dong Jin.)

2109
01:22:36,748 --> 01:22:38,088
Kim Dong Jin is out.

2110
01:22:38,118 --> 01:22:39,588
What?

2111
01:22:39,678 --> 01:22:41,278
So Yun got him.

2112
01:22:41,548 --> 01:22:42,878
Kim Dong Jin is out.

2113
01:22:42,948 --> 01:22:45,178
(Oh, no!)

2114
01:22:45,378 --> 01:22:48,748
(Team Ji Sung is on the run again.)

2115
01:22:50,848 --> 01:22:52,548
(Let's go get Jae Seok.)

2116
01:22:54,018 --> 01:22:55,088
We got you.

2117
01:22:56,378 --> 01:22:57,978
Let me go!

2118
01:22:59,278 --> 01:23:02,778
(Ji Hyo gets Jae Seok.)

2119
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:04,588
Look behind you!

2120
01:23:04,648 --> 01:23:06,018
Look behind you!

2121
01:23:08,948 --> 01:23:10,218
Be careful!

2122
01:23:10,278 --> 01:23:12,088
Ji Sung tackles Il Woo.

2123
01:23:13,918 --> 01:23:16,588
(Who will be the winner?)

2124
01:23:16,648 --> 01:23:17,878
(Who will be the last one standing?)

2125
01:23:17,948 --> 01:23:19,278
Who was faster?

2126
01:23:19,378 --> 01:23:20,588
He was quicker!

2127
01:23:21,588 --> 01:23:23,278
(Ji Sung's name tag is ripped first.)

2128
01:23:23,318 --> 01:23:24,818
(Then Il Woo's name tag)

2129
01:23:24,878 --> 01:23:26,548
He was quicker!

2130
01:23:26,588 --> 01:23:28,088
(It was a close one.)

2131
01:23:28,178 --> 01:23:29,178
Ji Sung is out.

2132
01:23:31,088 --> 01:23:32,648
Ji Sung has been taken out.

2133
01:23:32,678 --> 01:23:34,048
(Il Woo takes Ji Sung out.)

2134
01:23:34,148 --> 01:23:35,588
Let's change numbers.

2135
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:39,088
(Il Woo and Ji Hyo change their numbers.)

2136
01:23:39,378 --> 01:23:42,118
(Remaining players)

2137
01:23:42,478 --> 01:23:43,588
They should...

2138
01:23:44,178 --> 01:23:46,748
at least give us something to do.

2139
01:23:48,048 --> 01:23:49,218
Give us some cross stitch to do.

2140
01:23:49,278 --> 01:23:50,848
Or some other craft-work to do.

2141
01:23:51,278 --> 01:23:53,178
Those cross stitches this big.

2142
01:23:54,018 --> 01:23:55,278
- Those are the most popular ones. - Give us some work to do.

2143
01:23:55,318 --> 01:23:56,478
- Will make those craft-work... - That would keep us entertained.

2144
01:23:56,548 --> 01:23:58,748
and earn a few pennies.

2145
01:23:58,818 --> 01:24:00,818
Yes, for real.

2146
01:24:01,678 --> 01:24:02,778
Have you caught your breath?

2147
01:24:03,278 --> 01:24:05,218
If you have, we're going to run now.

2148
01:24:08,278 --> 01:24:11,048
(They all meet in one place.)

2149
01:24:11,088 --> 01:24:12,118
Look who it is.

2150
01:24:12,378 --> 01:24:13,478
What is this?

2151
01:24:13,588 --> 01:24:14,588
Am I your target?

2152
01:24:18,548 --> 01:24:21,118
I got him.

2153
01:24:22,548 --> 01:24:23,588
No!

2154
01:24:24,478 --> 01:24:28,278
(Tae Young is out.)

2155
01:24:28,378 --> 01:24:29,678
Kim Tae Young is out.

2156
01:24:29,778 --> 01:24:30,948
(Tae Young is out.)

2157
01:24:31,178 --> 01:24:32,278
- What? - What?

2158
01:24:33,178 --> 01:24:34,478
Oh, my gosh!

2159
01:24:35,178 --> 01:24:36,878
Oh, my!

2160
01:24:36,978 --> 01:24:38,848
No one knows what will happen.

2161
01:24:40,048 --> 01:24:41,548
I got him!

2162
01:24:42,318 --> 01:24:43,588
Wait!

2163
01:24:45,218 --> 01:24:46,278
You're too...

2164
01:24:46,378 --> 01:24:47,548
(Will Il Woo take Tae Se down?)

2165
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:51,678
(Someone's name tag is ripping off.)

2166
01:24:52,778 --> 01:24:53,818
Tae Se!

2167
01:24:53,878 --> 01:24:54,978
(So Yun gets Tae Se.)

2168
01:24:55,088 --> 01:24:56,318
Oh, my!

2169
01:24:57,048 --> 01:24:58,278
He got caught!

2170
01:24:59,878 --> 01:25:01,018
Jong Tae Se is out.

2171
01:25:02,818 --> 01:25:04,148
Jong Tae Se is out.

2172
01:25:04,178 --> 01:25:06,378
The game has finished then?

2173
01:25:06,478 --> 01:25:08,378
Nobody knew.

2174
01:25:10,748 --> 01:25:11,878
You're too...

2175
01:25:11,978 --> 01:25:13,118
Oh, gosh!

2176
01:25:13,178 --> 01:25:16,048
(Will the second half end like this? Or will Team Ji Sung revive?)

2177
01:25:16,088 --> 01:25:17,278
Hold him.

2178
01:25:18,918 --> 01:25:20,218
Come on.

2179
01:25:24,848 --> 01:25:25,878
I got it!

2180
01:25:25,948 --> 01:25:28,588
(Ji Hyo gets Kook Young.)

2181
01:25:28,678 --> 01:25:33,588
(Final results)

2182
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:37,588
(The second half of Running Man Champions League ends.)

2183
01:25:37,648 --> 01:25:38,778
Bravo, everyone.

2184
01:25:38,848 --> 01:25:40,048
Bravo.

2185
01:25:40,048 --> 01:25:42,848
The winning team is Team So Yun.

2186
01:25:44,478 --> 01:25:46,118
(Team So Yun wins the league.)

2187
01:25:46,778 --> 01:25:47,948
I knew this would happen.

2188
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:49,278
Congratulations!

2189
01:25:49,318 --> 01:25:52,048
Although it was quite unfair for us, I am very satisfied with the result.

2190
01:25:52,088 --> 01:25:53,118
We had a real disadvantage.

2191
01:25:53,178 --> 01:25:54,978
We did our best.

2192
01:25:55,048 --> 01:25:56,218
It's a football!

2193
01:25:56,278 --> 01:25:59,818
(Each carrying the football received from the drones,)

2194
01:26:01,048 --> 01:26:03,178
(flew over here excited,)

2195
01:26:03,778 --> 01:26:07,588
(and fought a match with the legends.)

2196
01:26:07,978 --> 01:26:12,218
(A short day of a long trip...)

2197
01:26:12,588 --> 01:26:17,178
(filled with familiar faces and new friends.)

2198
01:26:17,648 --> 01:26:21,278
(Thank you, for such a wonderful day!)

2199
01:26:22,848 --> 01:26:27,378
(But our journey does not end here.)

2200
01:26:29,318 --> 01:26:31,878
(Shanghai, 1926)

2201
01:26:33,018 --> 01:26:36,478
(10 young secret society members arrive with a mission.)

2202
01:26:36,678 --> 01:26:38,018
Secret Society!

2203
01:26:38,648 --> 01:26:40,648
Recollect all the items.

2204
01:26:40,748 --> 01:26:42,588
Return to headquarters!

2205
01:26:44,878 --> 01:26:46,878
(But!)

2206
01:26:47,278 --> 01:26:49,678
(Someone is suspicious.)

2207
01:26:50,678 --> 01:26:52,018
(Who threatens the Secret Society?)

2208
01:26:52,478 --> 01:26:54,048
Ji Sung looks shady.

2209
01:26:54,148 --> 01:26:55,818
(The plot behind the independence fund)

2210
01:26:55,878 --> 01:26:56,978
(Next week, Running Man Secret Society)
