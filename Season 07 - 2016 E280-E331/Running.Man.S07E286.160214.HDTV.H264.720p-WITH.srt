1
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,540
(A diamond has disappeared...)

2
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:15,550
(from a mysterious mountain cabin.)
(A diamond has disappeared...)

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:20,340
(from a mysterious mountain cabin.)

4
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:27,440
(Traces have been left on the scene.)

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:35,040
(What is the truth behind the disappearance of the diamond?)

6
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:44,310
(The day of the incident, January 26, 10pm)

7
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,910
(He's the detective.)

8
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,710
(And she's the suspect.)

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,440
- I am innocent.
- Yes.

10
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:09,140
I'm someone who has spent the most time...

11
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,780
with the other members.

12
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,450
The only time I was alone today...

13
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,740
was when I went in my room...

14
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,330
and tried to fall asleep.

15
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,940
Other than that, I never went outside alone.

16
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,980
If you check the visitor's history, you'll be able to see...

17
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,020
that I've never been here before.

18
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,780
That's all you need to check.

19
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,540
(Who's telling the truth?)

20
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,940
Why did you come here today?

21
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,840
Kwang Soo invited me.

22
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,600
Kwang Soo said...

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,140
- Go on.
- that he won an event...

24
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,110
and asked me to join him. That's why I came here.

25
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,110
(The day before the incident, January 25, 4pm)

26
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,140
(A mysterious letter was delivered to Kwang Soo.)

27
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,540
What's this?

28
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,340
Kwang Soo asked me to join him on a trip.

29
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,240
So I agreed. He said he won some kind of an event.

30
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,210
"Invitation to the mountain cabin. Congratulations."

31
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,540
"You have won free lodging at the mountain cabin."

32
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,580
It's free?

33
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,040
I get to stay at the mountain cabin for free.

34
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,710
It expires tomorrow.

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,350
It's my first time to win such an event.

36
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,740
(Kwang Soo, the symbol of misfortune, gets lucky?)

37
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,940
To be honest, I never entered the event.

38
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,410
I received an invitation.

39
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,040
- Okay.
- And many people have been...

40
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,640
asking me to treat them.

41
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,510
So since I got a free stay at the cabin, I thought...

42
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,440
I would invite the members to join me on the trip.

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,340
I won free lodging at a mountain cabin.

44
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,980
You don't need to bring anything.

45
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,810
I will prepare everything.

46
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,310
(The Case of Burglary of the Tears of the Sun)

47
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,540
(The day of the incident, January 26, 2pm)

48
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,040
Where are we going?

49
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,440
- Kwang Soo.
- You won an event?

50
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,140
It's an invitation. You will know when you get there.

51
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,040
- It's an invitation to...
- I'm nervous if its an invitation.

52
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,440
A mountain cabin?

53
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,140
- A mountain cabin?
- A free lodging event.

54
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,240
- Yes.
- I'm scared for some reason.

55
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,540
- We're staying the night there.
- But...

56
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,710
- Hey.
- Why all of a sudden?

57
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,940
- Don't be suspicious.
- Maybe it's a haunted house.

58
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,040
Come on.

59
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,200
What if it's a blind dating event at the mountain cabin?

60
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,300
- I'd love that!
- Seok Jin.

61
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,540
It's nice just thinking about it.

62
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,440
Anything is possible.

63
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,610
(The day of the incident, 2:40pm, Gapyeong tourist site)

64
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,680
- It's...
- We're here.

65
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,910
Can you see the mountain cabin over there?

66
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,740
There's the mountain cabin.

67
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,040
What is this place?

68
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,440
- What's this?
- Okay.

69
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,140
Kwang Soo, it's very nice.

70
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,020
Look at this place. This place is amazing.

71
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,240
Why are you amazed too? You invited us here.

72
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,340
There are people partying inside.

73
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,540
- Is this a tourist spot?
- What's this place?

74
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,940
- Look at that.
- What is it?

75
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,440
Is it some sort of a party?

76
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,640
It's a party.

77
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,660
Look, they are all wearing our name tags.

78
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,940
What's going on?

79
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,140
(It's a dance party in the middle of the cabin.)

80
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,510
Let me leave my bag here.

81
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,760
Maybe it's a race with the community.

82
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,240
Finally,

83
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,740
- What's going on?
- things are changing.

84
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,880
What are we doing here?

85
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,040
What is this?

86
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,120
It's a dance party!

87
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,340
What's going on?

88
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,610
What's happening?

89
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,450
Kwang Soo, are we having a party today?

90
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,440
- This is great!
- Is it going to be...

91
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,610
- an outdoor party?
- This is awesome.

92
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,650
(Welcome! Is it your first time at a mountain cabin party?)

93
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,910
There's a barbecue too.

94
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,040
- It's a party!
- What's this?

95
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,540
There's a barbecue here.

96
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,910
What's going on?

97
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,450
(Everyone is getting excited.)

98
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,240
It's really a party!

99
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,510
Are we having a party today, Kwang Soo?

100
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,740
(Security guard: Choi Bo An)

101
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,240
I never expected something like this.

102
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,610
- Hello.
- Hello.

103
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,150
- Hello.
- Who received the invitation?

104
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,510
- It's me.
- It's you.

105
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,840
- What's this?
- I'm glad he invited us.

106
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,340
- Okay.
- This is great.

107
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,010
I will take care of everything today.

108
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,040
But isn't it too early for a dance party?

109
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,950
Just trust me!

110
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,340
I think it's too early.

111
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,810
There's food, too.

112
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,240
Is this an after-club party?

113
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,010
- An after-club party?
- Thank you.

114
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,340
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

115
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,450
- Oh wow.
- Let's go in.

116
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,810
- What is this place?
- Great job, Kwang Soo!

117
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,240
Thanks to Kwang Soo, we were able to come here.

118
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,780
What did I tell you?

119
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,740
- They are partying well.
- Oh wow.

120
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,610
- I know.
- They really are.

121
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,640
She's doing the rabbit dance.

122
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,010
It's a real party.

123
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,940
- Hello!
- We're from "Running Man".

124
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,150
(Let's party together!)

125
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,810
Let's party.

126
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:31,940
(They leave their worries behind and immerse themselves in the fun.)

127
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,240
This is great.

128
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,340
Since you're eating and dancing, you can digest food immediately.

129
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,780
(While the party is heating up...)

130
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,280
He grills meat well.

131
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,780
(A mysterious woman...)

132
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,540
(is heading somewhere.)

133
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,340
(Who is this woman...)

134
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,040
(that is approaching the party?)

135
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,010
- Look at her.
- Hello.

136
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,140
- Hello.
- Hello.

137
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,140
- Hello.
- Goodness.

138
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,240
- Oh my.
- Hello.

139
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,040
Go on, everyone.

140
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,640
(Kim Ga Yeon, the owner of the cabin)

141
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,240
- Hello.
- Hello.

142
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,540
- Hello, everyone.
- What are you doing here?

143
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,240
- Hello.
- What's going on today?

144
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,500
- I am the owner of this cabin.
- I see.

145
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,240
- Oh.
- It's your party.

146
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,640
- I...
- You're the owner?

147
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,440
Wait, let me talk first.

148
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,540
Be careful with your fur.

149
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,040
- Oh, my fur!
- Behind you.

150
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,240
It didn't touch the fire.

151
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,140
When you were walking towards us, I thought you were a dog.

152
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,340
Be careful.

153
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,880
- Hey!
- I just saw...

154
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,010
- This is from abroad!
- I see.

155
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,510
Of course.

156
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,340
I am the hottest...

157
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,540
heiress of Korea.

158
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,980
The only thing I have is beauty and money.

159
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,140
- You are my ideal type of a girl!
- She's perfect.

160
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,340
You are my ideal type.

161
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,840
- By the way,
- Yes?

162
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,940
what should we do now?

163
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,840
You should enjoy the party. Please enjoy the party...

164
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,880
with the many guests that are here today.

165
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,910
- We just have to enjoy the party?
- Of course.

166
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,440
Last time,

167
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,340
your husband was on our show.

168
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,410
- Right.
- My husband?

169
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,440
He's not very good at playing arcade games.

170
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,140
- He played tetris.
- He wasn't very good.

171
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,940
- He lost in tetris.
- He did.

172
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,040
It's such an honour...

173
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,680
to have you guys here at the mountain cabin.

174
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,540
(Laughing)

175
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,840
(I'm hot.)

176
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,910
What is that?

177
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,340
(Will you look at my necklace?)

178
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,640
- It's heavy.
- I know.

179
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,710
Look at my necklace.

180
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,140
Oh, the necklace!

181
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,810
That's a nice necklace.

182
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,910
- It's gorgeous.
- Is it authentic?

183
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,710
- Have you seen this?
- It's gorgeous.

184
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,980
Aren't they droplet diamonds?

185
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,340
These diamonds are known as Tears of the Sun.

186
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,810
They're worth 20 million dollars.

187
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,310
- 20 million dollars?
- What is?

188
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,910
(They're worth 20 million dollars?)

189
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,010
(Also known as Tears of the Sun, they are worth 20 million dollars.)

190
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,510
Take a look. You can touch them.

191
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,410
I saw them at a street market the other day.

192
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,080
At a street market.

193
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,580
These are not the same.

194
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,080
- I'm sorry.
- Look at her.

195
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,210
I apologise.

196
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,910
They look similar, but the ones I saw were fake.

197
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,810
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes.

198
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,610
- You can touch it.
- Really?

199
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,740
- Be careful.
- Sure.

200
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,310
Wow.

201
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,110
Thank you.

202
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,980
Diamonds that are worth 20 million dollars.

203
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,310
There wasn't anything special about them,

204
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,540
but it was an interesting sight.

205
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,610
(I want those diamonds.)

206
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,980
I'm being honest.

207
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,110
Diamonds...

208
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,540
are vulnerable to moisture.

209
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,910
- I see.
- So...

210
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,010
- I'll go put them in my room.
- Okay.

211
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,580
Please excuse me for a moment.

212
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,010
- Of course.
- Sure.

213
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,210
- Thank you.
- See you.

214
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,010
- See you later.
- Bye.

215
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,600
- Let's go.
- This is a real party.

216
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,510
Partying with you guys is fun.

217
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,420
I didn't expect this.

218
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,210
This tastes great.

219
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,910
We should eat before doing anything else.

220
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,640
(Ga Yeon's room is in this building.)

221
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,370
Good afternoon.

222
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,910
Wait.

223
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:10,180
(The day of the incident, 3:20pm, Ga Yeon enters her room.)

224
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,710
It's cold.

225
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,780
My lovely necklace.

226
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,590
(Entering the password)

227
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,910
(Her safe requires a password to access it.)

228
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,280
There you go.

229
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,440
(Ga Yeon's safe can be open with a password.)

230
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,910
My precious baby.

231
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,010
(Kissing)

232
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:48,160
(Ga Yeon keeps the Tears of the Sun in her personal safe.)

233
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,310
(I'll see you later.)

234
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:59,610
(The day of the incident, 3:25pm,)

235
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,010
(Ga Yeon stores the Tears of the Sun.)

236
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,490
Hello, everybody!

237
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,010
Enjoy!

238
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,510
This is a high-class party.

239
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,310
What did I tell you?

240
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,310
- I'm impressed.
- Kwang Soo.

241
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,210
- I'm very impressed.
- It was a good idea.

242
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,810
- See?
- It's all thanks to you.

243
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,510
This is a rare opportunity.

244
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,610
You surprised me, Ga Yeon.

245
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,600
The fire is too weak.

246
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,280
- Let me see.
- The meat won't cook.

247
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,610
I'll cut the meat since I'm the owner.

248
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,010
It's not cooked yet.

249
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,110
- It's raw.
- It's hard to cut right now.

250
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,910
- We should wait a bit.
- This is annoying. I give up.

251
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,410
- The scissors are dull. Jong Kook.
- Yes?

252
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,110
Do you see the big building over there?

253
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,210
- The one over there?
- Right, the one on top.

254
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,640
- That's where my room is.
- Okay.

255
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,410
My room is the first one in the corridor.

256
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,010
- Okay.
- In my room,

257
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,610
I have sharper scissors.

258
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,810
- I bought them when I was abroad.
- Okay.

259
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,510
- Can you go get them?
- It's the first room, right?

260
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,910
- Yes, don't touch anything else.
- Okay.

261
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,080
- Scissors.
- I understand.

262
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,710
- As in "rock, paper, scissors".
- All right.

263
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,410
Okay. I'll be right back.

264
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,680
Scissors.

265
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,210
Hi.

266
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,710
(The day of the incident, 3:45pm, Jong Kook greets Guest 99.)

267
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,510
(Looking around)

268
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:33,110
(This room must be hers.)

269
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,580
(The day of the incident, 3:47pm, Jong Kook enters Ga Yeon's room...)

270
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,710
(in search of the scissors.)

271
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:43,010
She wanted scissors. Here they are.

272
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,710
(Looking around the room)

273
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:56,380
(The items in her room look rather ordinary.)

274
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,410
Let's see.

275
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,610
There's a safe.

276
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,110
(There's a safe.)

277
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,910
(This is where the Tears of the Sun is kept.)

278
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,310
It's a safe.

279
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,010
All right.

280
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:30,410
(The day of the incident, 4:00pm, Jong Kook exits Ga Yeon's room.)

281
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,010
I have scissors.

282
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,410
Hello.

283
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,910
Why isn't Jong Kook coming?

284
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,410
- What is he doing?
- Is he doing a mission?

285
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,480
Ga Yeon.

286
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,710
- Here are your scissors.
- Jong Kook.

287
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,710
Jong Kook, they're telling us to wait.

288
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,610
- What?
- But look,

289
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,110
we're running out of salads.

290
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,110
- Haha, we're running out of salads.
- Okay.

291
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,590
I have some vegetables in my room.

292
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,810
- You should wash them too.
- Ga Yeon, I'm sorry but...

293
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,210
- Yes.
- we have a lot of vegetables here.

294
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,380
No, we need some more.

295
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,580
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes.

296
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,340
I have some drinks in my room.

297
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,310
- Drinks?
- Yes, can you get them?

298
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,910
Ga Yeon, can't you leave us alone?

299
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,010
No, I can't.

300
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,980
- Isn't the customer the king?
- I'm getting upset.

301
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,380
(Isn't the customer the king?)

302
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,410
Ga Yeon was a bit strange.

303
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,170
Customers should be the king, but she kept bothering us...

304
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,380
and ordering us around.

305
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,810
Where is Ga Yeon's room?

306
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,580
(Haha also runs into Guest 99.)

307
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,090
She told me to bring some vegetables.

308
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:42,980
(The day of the incident, 4:18pm, Haha enters Ga Yeon's room.)

309
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:48,580
(Haha discovers something as soon as he enters.)

310
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,710
(Ga Yeon's safe where the Tears of the Sun is kept)

311
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,810
Hi.

312
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,110
(The day of the incident, 4:30pm, Ji Hyo arrives at the building.)

313
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,610
Ga Yeon has a nice place.

314
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,480
(Ji Hyo found the safe, too.)

315
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,980
(The day of the incident, 4:36pm, Ji Hyo leaves Ga Yeon's room.)

316
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,080
Where's the meat?

317
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,710
(The day of the incident, 4:44pm, Kwang Soo enters Ga Yeon's room...)

318
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,810
(for some meat)

319
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,280
Why does she have a safe?

320
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,380
She must keep her necklace there.

321
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,810
(She must keep her necklace there.)

322
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,310
(Sneaking in)

323
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,310
- Kwang Soo.
- I brought the meat.

324
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,710
Did they make you do something there?

325
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,370
No, no one was there.

326
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,210
- No one?
- No.

327
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,840
- It tastes great.
- It's delicious.

328
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,410
Here you go.

329
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,110
- Get some rest.
- Already?

330
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,180
- See you tomorrow.
- Gary and Haha are here.

331
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,330
- Good night.
- Good night.

332
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,910
We're going to bed already?

333
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,380
(Room 3: Haha)

334
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,010
This is nice.

335
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,900
Who is it?

336
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,110
It's me, Ga Yeon.

337
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,710
- You surprised me.
- You surprised me, too.

338
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,910
What's the matter?

339
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,210
There was something suspicious about her.

340
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,380
She told us to get all kinds of things from vegetables and...

341
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,980
drinks to blankets.

342
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,880
She makes me uncomfortable.

343
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,380
I feel very uncomfortable.

344
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,480
(Please take her away.)

345
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,010
You'll find room 209 two doors away from my room.

346
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,610
- Okay.
- There are some blankets there.

347
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,110
Can you get them?

348
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,080
- Goodness.
- Bye.

349
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,110
(What's wrong with her?)

350
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,410
- I have some wine in my room.
- Okay.

351
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,410
- Wine?
- Please go get it.

352
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,810
She wants four bottles of wine.

353
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,980
(The day of the incident, 6:55pm, Seok Jin heads to Ga Yeon's room.)

354
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,380
Go to my room...

355
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,610
- I'll bring the remote control.
- and bring only the remote control.

356
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,080
It's freezing.

357
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,910
I don't even watch TV. Why do I need a remote control?

358
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,710
She said it's two doors away.

359
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,010
What's going on?

360
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:53,580
(Only Jae Seok was sent to another room.)

361
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,010
My goodness.

362
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,010
It's freezing.

363
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,010
I don't watch TV. I don't need a remote control.

364
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,280
I should look carefully.

365
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,380
(Gary notices the safe, too.)

366
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,010
This might be a mission.

367
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,210
Here's the wine.

368
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,980
(He approaches the safe.)

369
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,610
(And tries to open it.)

370
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,990
Gosh.

371
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,840
She said she's an heiress. This safe must be full of valuable things.

372
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,780
This mountain cabin...

373
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,510
has a nice vibe.

374
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,210
I'm sure something grand will happen.

375
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,010
(I'm sure something grand will happen.)

376
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,210
This has never happened before.

377
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,110
I'm so bored.

378
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,610
We had no idea of what was about to happen.

379
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,710
We didn't know something like that would happen there.

380
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,910
(We didn't know something like that would happen there.)

381
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,580
My goodness!

382
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,180
My diamonds!

383
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,800
My goodness! My diamonds!

384
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,510
My diamonds are gone! My Tears of the Sun!

385
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,310
- What?
- Excuse me.

386
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,110
Have you seen my diamonds?

387
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,750
My diamonds are gone!

388
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,140
Is she in danger?

389
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,410
Jae Seok, what do I do?

390
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:30,340
The Tears of the Sun disappeared! What do I do?

391
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,540
(The 20-million-dollar Tears of the Sun has been stolen.)

392
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,950
Have you seen it?

393
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,410
I haven't seen it.

394
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,640
You saw it a while ago.

395
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,140
Yes, I did see it then.

396
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,750
- But you haven't seen it after?
- No, I haven't.

397
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,810
- I knew this would happen.
- Quick, come here.

398
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,540
- Jong Kook.
- Yes.

399
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,130
Come here quick.

400
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,450
(Knocking)

401
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,810
Seok Jin.

402
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,950
Come out, quick.

403
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,840
- Why?
- My necklace is missing.

404
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,040
- Come out quickly.
- What?

405
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,910
- The necklace is fake, I tell you.
- Come out, quick.

406
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,410
Don't tell us. Report to the police.

407
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,410
Where did you leave it?

408
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,540
I took it with me and put it in the safe.

409
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,840
Then I closed the safe and enjoyed the party.

410
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,010
- That's right.
- Yes.

411
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:20,810
After the party, I went around to make sure you were all comfortable.

412
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,280
Then I went into my room...

413
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,450
to take it out and polish it, but the necklace was missing!

414
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:30,380
I couldn't find it anywhere. It's worth 20 million dollars.

415
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,040
Why are you telling us this?

416
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,750
Just call the police.

417
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,450
- I called the police.
- Okay.

418
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,110
- But it snowed today.
- Right.

419
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,840
So they said it will take them four hours to get here.

420
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,950
- What kind of police is that?
- So I was hoping that you could...

421
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,840
- find the necklace in four hours.
- All right.

422
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,340
If you find it,

423
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,240
I will let you leave this place.

424
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,940
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

425
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,140
I'm in fact Detective Yu.

426
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,610
Shut your mouth.

427
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,040
No one ever called you that.

428
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,010
- Are you the thief?
- You're probably the thief.

429
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,640
- He's the thief.
- Since when were you a detective?

430
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,640
They call me Sherlock Yu.

431
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,450
That's enough.

432
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,240
Don't act on your own from now on.

433
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,840
Because these people...

434
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,540
have been in my room at least once.

435
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,910
- So they are all suspects.
- One of us may be the thief.

436
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,710
- You're right.
- Who's the thief?

437
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,950
- Confess this instant.
- Wait.

438
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,980
- Give it back so we can go home.
- Don't leave anyone behind.

439
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,110
Let's all go to the crime scene together.

440
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,240
It may be a coincidence,

441
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,020
but all the members have been near Ga Yeon's room at least once.

442
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,440
Therefore, we can all be suspected.

443
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,710
(Previously on Running Man)

444
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,980
(The members were invited to the mountain cabin.)

445
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,340
Hello everyone.

446
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,740
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

447
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,910
- Go get some more meat.
- Why are there so many errands?

448
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,180
The necklace disappeared. What do I do?

449
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,830
- The thief is among us!
- The thief is among us!

450
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,140
(Gary, Yu Jae Seok)

451
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,340
(Ji Seok Jin, Haha)

452
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,610
(Kim Jong Kook, Song Ji Hyo, Lee Kwang Soo)

453
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,440
(The Burglary of the Tears of the Sun)

454
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,420
I'll ask some direct questions.

455
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,140
Jae Seok,

456
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,200
who do you think is the thief?

457
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,180
From the beginning,

458
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,040
- I thought the thief was among us.
- Okay.

459
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,940
But among our members, there is only one suspect.

460
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,550
Where were you at the time?

461
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:20,340
I went to see Ga Yeon.

462
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,580
Criminals always leave behind clues at the crime scene.

463
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,980
That's right.

464
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,010
We'll start by looking around the crime scene.

465
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,210
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin have come to investigate the crime scene.)

466
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,420
See!

467
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,650
This wasn't open before.

468
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,610
- Goodness.
- This was closed before.

469
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,880
- What?
- I had locked it.

470
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,840
(There was a 20-million-dollar necklace inside the safe.)

471
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,140
(She saw that the necklace was put in safely with her own two eyes.)

472
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:53,080
(Who could have possibly opened the high-tech safe?)

473
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,140
To be honest, I did try to open it. I was curious.

474
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,140
- But I couldn't open it.
- Why would you touch that?

475
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,640
But how did the thief open this?

476
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,040
You need to know the password to open it.

477
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,540
- Wait a minute.
- Of course.

478
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,240
What is the password?

479
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,340
- What is it?
- Actually,

480
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,040
I always set my password to four zeros.

481
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,140
- Do you really?
- My goodness.

482
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,450
That way, I don't forget.

483
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,640
- What? Four zeros?
- Why did you make it like that?

484
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,680
It's way too simple.

485
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,340
Who could have possibly taken the necklace?

486
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,640
This is frustrating.

487
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,910
Quickly, find out who took it.

488
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,140
- We need to investigate this room.
- All seven members have been here.

489
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,610
- Wait,
- Right?

490
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,340
did you leave this window open?

491
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,140
Yes, to ventilate the room.

492
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,240
It's important to ventilate the room in the winter.

493
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,180
Even so, don't you think you left it open for too long?

494
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,580
It's because it's not automatic.

495
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,780
There must be a clue here.

496
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,310
The thief must have left a clue.

497
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,010
- Well...
- We should look for fingerprints.

498
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,040
Who has been in this room?

499
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,140
- Everyone.
- Everyone.

500
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,940
I haven't been in this room before.

501
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,010
- I came here to...
- To bring the wine. And Gary?

502
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,710
He came to bring the remote control.

503
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,440
- From this room?
- Yes.

504
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,240
But you told me to go to the room next door.

505
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,240
- I didn't come in here.
- You didn't come here?

506
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,740
- It was the room next to this one.
- Why was he sent elsewhere?

507
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,410
Because the blankets were over there.

508
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,640
- There are blankets here, too.
- They were washed recently.

509
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,340
- This is my blanket.
- Oh, I see.

510
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,880
The guest blankets were in the other room.

511
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,410
I think you're the culprit.

512
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,310
(I think you're the culprit.)

513
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,810
(What?)

514
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:23,040
(Jae Seok suddenly suspects Ga Yeon to be the thief.)

515
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,840
What did you say?

516
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,390
Do you think this is a joke?

517
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:30,040
I think you're after the insurance money.

518
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,640
- Aren't I right?
- That might be true.

519
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,840
(She planned this to get the insurance money?)

520
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,340
(Jae Seok suspects that Ga Yeon has planned the theft.)

521
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,110
Why did Kwang Soo bring us here?

522
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,740
He just wanted to hang out with us.

523
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,040
I'll take care of everything today!

524
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,540
You'll find out when you get there.

525
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,010
- An invitation?
- Mountain cabin?

526
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,380
- That's where we're going?
- Yes.

527
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,660
I think the person who rented this place,

528
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,420
Kwang Soo, is the most suspicious.

529
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,910
It's something Kwang Soo would do.

530
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,440
He's the only person who would do this kind of thing.

531
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,140
He's always up to no good.

532
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,080
I suspect Kwang Soo.

533
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,940
This might be...

534
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,980
related to Guest 99 and Kwang Soo.

535
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,440
Maybe it's related to a number of people.

536
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,940
- Do you think so?
- Don't you agree?

537
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,200
Or why else would he have brought us here?

538
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,640
- There's no other reason.
- But here...

539
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,040
Guest 99.

540
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,760
Guest 99 is definitely related to this case.

541
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,280
I'm sure of it. We have to find Guest 99 first.

542
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,510
Excuse me,

543
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,140
have you ever seen Guest 99?

544
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,740
(Shaking their heads)

545
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,340
I remember his face.

546
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,340
(Although it was a short moment, Gary remembers his face.)

547
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,010
I clearly remember what he looks like.

548
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,710
(Haha and Gary believe Guest 99 is the key to solving this crime.)

549
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,710
Guest 99.

550
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,840
Who should we ask?

551
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,010
Excuse me,

552
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,240
- did you see it?
- Did you see anyone...

553
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,280
- going in the cabin owner's room?
- The cabin owner's room.

554
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,140
We just got back from the grocery store.

555
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,010
- So you didn't see anyone?
- No, we didn't.

556
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,010
- Okay.
- Thank you.

557
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

558
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,240
- It was too cold.
- Okay.

559
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,440
So we didn't go out.

560
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,140
- It was too cold to go outside?
- Yes.

561
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,920
They didn't go out of the room because it was cold?

562
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,410
That's strange.

563
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,740
Jong Kook,

564
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,540
there are two men here.

565
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,640
There are women, too. Let's go and ask them.

566
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,840
- Hello.
- You should have knocked.

567
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,910
- Look, there's a couple here.
- Look, number 93.

568
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,310
Hello.

569
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:35,920
- By chance have you seen...
- In the cabin owner's room.

570
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,340
- someone going in the owner's room?
- Anyone suspicious?

571
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,040
(Did you see anyone suspicious near the owner's room?)

572
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,010
- I saw some people.
- Suspicious people?

573
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,240
(Someone was there?)

574
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,640
I saw the employees.

575
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,540
I think I saw the cleaning ladies go up to the cabin.

576
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,040
The employees of this mountain cabin went up to the owner's room.

577
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,110
Oh, the employees?

578
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,610
- Is that right?
- Thank you.

579
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,440
All right. Thank you.

580
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,410
- Cleaning ladies?
- Let's go find them.

581
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,540
There are a lot of people here.

582
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,810
There was also the guard.

583
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,410
- Yes, the first person we saw.
- We saw the guard this morning.

584
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,640
There's an employee over there.

585
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,910
- Hello.
- An employee.

586
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,140
- Hello.
- An employee?

587
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,010
- Yes, he is an employee.
- Is he really?

588
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,240
We were wondering if you happened to see...

589
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,940
anyone suspicious go near the cabin owner's room?

590
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,340
Have you seen anyone suspicious?

591
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,240
We're in charge of the food supplies so we weren't able to see anyone.

592
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,640
- You're in charge of food supplies?
- Right.

593
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,940
- So you were only in this place?
- Yes.

594
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,800
- You've never went up this way?
- I was in this area.

595
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,040
The cleaning lady has the master key.

596
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,880
That's what I was saying.

597
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,440
- There's a master key.
- She's probably over there.

598
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,740
- This way?
- All right.

599
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,340
- The cleaning lady.
- Thank you.

600
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,190
Thank you very much.

601
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,010
The cleaning lady?

602
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,640
It's the the cleaners' room.

603
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,780
- It's here.
- The cleaners' room.

604
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,140
(They found the cleaners' room nearby.)

605
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,570
Hello.

606
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,240
Nice to meet you.

607
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,510
(Who is it?)

608
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,230
- Hello. Jong Kook, over here.
- Look, she's in here.

609
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,830
- Hello.
- Hello.

610
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,540
Have you been in the cabin owner's room earlier today?

611
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,110
Did you clean the room?

612
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,340
The cabin owner's room?

613
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,340
- Yes, I did.
- You cleaned the room?

614
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,040
Did you clean the room when we were with the owner...

615
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,140
or after we parted with the owner?

616
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,540
In the morning.

617
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,410
- In the morning.
- I see.

618
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,510
Then did you...

619
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:09,940
Did you happen to lend or lose the master key today?

620
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,040
No, I didn't.

621
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,940
- Have you ever stolen...
- We need to ask the others.

622
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,440
other people's things?

623
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,410
- She might have experience.
- What are you saying?

624
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,940
- Kwang Soo.
- Maybe when she was young.

625
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,750
- All right.
- It's not that we suspect you.

626
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,540
But we have to think of every possibility.

627
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,980
- Yes, we're sorry.
- We apologise for...

628
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,240
- a number of things.
- I'm sorry.

629
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,140
- We're sorry to have bothered you.
- Rest well.

630
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,040
If we have further questions, we'll come back to ask you.

631
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,610
- Yes.
- I think we should hold...

632
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,840
- onto her passport just in case.
- You're right.

633
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:39,040
There's no reason to come here from another room since it's so cold.

634
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,240
- Meaning the thief's room is here.
- Exactly.

635
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,440
So the thief came out of the room...

636
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,240
- Yes, to drink a cup of coffee.
- and came over here.

637
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,440
- He was drinking coffee here.
- You're right.

638
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,110
Gary, you are amazing.

639
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,510
(He looks in the room.)

640
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,080
(Goodness)

641
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,940
Excuse me.

642
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,240
What is it?

643
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,240
(The witness, Park Kwan Chal, Guest 99)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

644
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,880
Are you meeting him for the first time?

645
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,240
You were over here?

646
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,240
- Is it your first time seeing him?
- Yes, it's the first time.

647
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,510
Have a seat.

648
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,010
- Do you know the owner's room?
- Yes.

649
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,690
How many people went in the room?

650
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,040
How many went in?

651
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,640
(Guest 99 witnessed everything...)

652
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,440
(from the beginning to the end.)

653
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,980
(All the members had been in the room, except Jae Seok.)

654
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,640
(His testimony might change the entire course of the investigation.)

655
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,640
- Right.
- Honestly, did you...

656
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,740
try to open the safe or not?

657
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,310
- I didn't.
- Did you try?

658
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,940
- No, I didn't.
- To be honest, I tried.

659
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,740
- Why?
- I was just curious.

660
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,110
- That's weird.
- I tried...

661
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,040
- What are you saying?
- I tried pressing the buttons.

662
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,410
- I tried to press the buttons.
- You're saying this...

663
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,740
- so we don't suspect you.
- No.

664
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,740
I only tried. But I just found out that the password...

665
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,740
- is 0000.
- How do you know?

666
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,280
Ga Yeon told me.

667
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,410
The cabin owner told me.

668
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,110
- I didn't try 0000.
- Are you close with Ga Yeon?

669
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,380
- I know her personally.
- Wait a minute.

670
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,510
- I met her before Running Man.
- Wait.

671
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,340
Give me a break.

672
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,820
Whatever.

673
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,040
He said he tried to open the safe.

674
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,500
He was trying to...

675
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,510
make us think that he had nothing to do with the case.

676
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:14,140
That was very strange. I'm suspicious of him.

677
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,110
Did Jae Seok go in or not?

678
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,210
He said he didn't go in.

679
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,510
He didn't.

680
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:23,140
- He didn't go in?
- He went to...

681
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,480
- the room next to Ga Yeon's room.
- Did he...

682
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,580
- go to the next room?
- Yes.

683
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,840
- Was he getting blankets?
- Right.

684
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,740
- The blankets were there.
- Yes, you're right.

685
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,140
- Did he bring out blankets?
- Yes.

686
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,580
I remember clearly.

687
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,140
- Hold on.
- Wait, listen to me.

688
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,240
It was the room next to Ga Yeon's?

689
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,340
Yes, it was.

690
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,340
- Are the rooms connected?
- If it's the room next door,

691
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,880
he could've entered her room through the terrace.

692
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,240
He didn't see Jae Seok go in though.

693
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,480
No, that's not it.

694
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,880
It's Jae Seok.

695
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,840
Why isn't Jae Seok one of the suspects?

696
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,580
(Why isn't Jae Seok one of the suspects?)

697
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,940
That confused me.

698
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,440
He was the only one that didn't go into the owner's room.

699
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,340
The witness, Guest 99, said...

700
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,840
Jae Seok didn't go into that room.

701
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,940
He did not go in.

702
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,240
It's possible that since the rooms were right next to each other,

703
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,100
Jae Suk went into Ga Yeon's room through the terrace,

704
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,340
instead of getting the blankets.

705
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,640
He stole the necklace, came back to the room...

706
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,140
for the blankets and left.

707
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,940
He has a perfect alibi because...

708
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,340
there's a witness.

709
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,810
(Jae Seok has a perfect alibi.)

710
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,740
He didn't go in through the door.

711
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,410
He went in through...

712
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,840
- the terrace.
- Wait.

713
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,840
- Is that possible?
- Usually...

714
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,640
in mystery movies,

715
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,010
- whoever doesn't go inside...
- That's the suspect.

716
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:36,530
Right. In order to prove that he didn't enter the room,

717
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,040
- he went in the room next to it.
- You're smart.

718
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,210
He went in through the terrace and came back.

719
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,540
- That's great.
- Wow.

720
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,140
That's amazing. Is it okay to catch the suspect this quickly?

721
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,540
What about this?

722
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,140
Someone opened the safe and...

723
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,540
What was that?

724
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,340
(What was that noise?)

725
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,640
Wait a minute.

726
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,440
- What was that?
- At this important moment,

727
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,140
I think a bomb just exploded.

728
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,340
Why did you have to fart at such a critical moment?

729
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,640
- My goodness.
- Oh no.

730
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,540
But why am I covering my mouth?

731
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,940
- Seok Jin.
- Go to the bathroom.

732
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,540
Come on.

733
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,340
- You see.
- Seok Jin,

734
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,380
- you should've restrained yourself.
- Well...

735
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,640
Well, you see...

736
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,140
- it's hard.
- I see.

737
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,640
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be nervous.

738
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,780
- Wait, are you the thief?
- No, I'm not.

739
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,740
- You seem nervous.
- I can't smile if I'm nervous.

740
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,940
You seem to be nervous.

741
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,310
(They continue to argue.)

742
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,540
My diamonds.

743
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,640
Let's check this room.

744
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,380
- Let's ask the guard.
- Okay.

745
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,940
Let's go meet the guard.

746
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,540
- Let's ask the guard.
- The cleaning lady...

747
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,740
and the guard...

748
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,240
have master keys.

749
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,040
What did the cleaning lady say?

750
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,580
She said she only cleaned the room and left.

751
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,740
Excuse me.

752
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,940
Could you please come out for a minute?

753
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,340
- Okay.
- Do you...

754
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,240
have a master key...

755
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,580
that opens the cabin owner's room?

756
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,140
I only keep a record of...

757
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:00,740
people who stay in the cabin.

758
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,610
If there is a problem, the manager...

759
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,640
So you didn't go to her room today?

760
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,610
I didn't leave this room today.

761
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,740
- Not at all?
- Correct.

762
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,190
Can I check your pockets?

763
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,410
You never know, he might have the necklace.

764
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,480
- You never know.
- That's not how you do it.

765
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,110
- Come on.
- Do you have the master key?

766
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,710
- I don't have it.
- You don't have it?

767
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,110
- I see.
- Where's the manager's room?

768
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,410
- It's over there.
- Okay.

769
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,640
- It's room 14.
- I see.

770
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,610
- Let's go.
- Can we see the guestbook?

771
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,380
- Maybe there's something in there.
- You're right.

772
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,030
There might be something in there.

773
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,510
(It has a record of all the visitors.)

774
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,840
- Why didn't we think of this?
- It's here.

775
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,040
This is an actual list...

776
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,910
of the people who stayed here.

777
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,880
(There might be a clue.)

778
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,840
- Okay, I got it.
- Great.

779
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,220
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

780
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,510
- Let's go to room 14 first.
- Shall we?

781
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,540
Let's go to the manager's room.

782
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,540
Oh goodness.

783
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,510
And so we headed for the manager's room.

784
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,210
It's so cold today.

785
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,640
The manager, who has the master key,

786
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,780
is an important person.

787
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,380
It's here.

788
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,180
- This is it.
- It's here, room 14.

789
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,040
It's the manager's room.

790
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,840
We're here.

791
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,380
This is room 14.

792
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,260
It's the manager's room.

793
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,810
Hello?

794
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,940
- Can we ask you something?
- We'd like to...

795
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,110
- ask you something.
- The door is locked.

796
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,440
(The door is locked.)

797
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,410
- Sir?
- It's locked?

798
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,410
- What?
- The door is locked.

799
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,740
Look, it's "Running Milk".

800
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,240
- What is this?
- What is it?

801
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,840
- Leave it alone.
- It might be a clue.

802
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,640
- Wait.
- The milk...

803
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,040
- is still outside.
- Check the date.

804
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,920
- A newspaper is here, too.
- Don't touch it.

805
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,140
The manager wasn't here.

806
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,640
- He must've stolen the necklace.
- No.

807
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,010
- He's dead.
- What?

808
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,310
- What do you mean?
- What are you talking about?

809
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,510
His shoes are here. What is the date on the newspaper?

810
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,480
- His shoes are really here.
- That's why he's the thief.

811
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,140
(That means there's someone inside.)

812
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,480
- This says January 26th.
- What's the date on the newspaper?

813
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,510
- It's the same.
- It's a murder case.

814
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,340
What's today's date?

815
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,640
Isn't it the 26th?

816
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,010
- Where's the manager?
- If it's really a murder case,

817
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,440
we need to call the police.

818
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,210
- Hurry!
- Someone's on the floor.

819
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,640
- What?
- Really?

820
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,440
- Are you sure?
- The manager is on the floor.

821
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,380
- Really?
- I told you.

822
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,510
- The manager didn't drink the milk.
- Are you crazy?

823
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:14,540
- He's on the floor.
- This is a murder case.

824
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,140
- How could this be?
- It's a murder case.

825
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,910
- Wait a minute.
- His name tag is on the floor.

826
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,040
- The murder happened inside.
- The door is locked on the outside.

827
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,510
- And it's locked on the inside.
- I'm a pro at this.

828
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,440
I was at Johns Hopkins...

829
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,830
Be quiet!

830
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,940
- Where is that?
- Where is Johns Hopkins?

831
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,240
- Tell me where it is.
- Johns Hopkins...

832
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,120
- Johns Hopkins...
- Wait.

833
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,040
- Why are you stuttering?
- Who am I?

834
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,110
I'm Johns Hopkins.

835
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:39,010
Look. The door is locked from inside and someone's dead.

836
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,510
This means that the murder took place inside.

837
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,010
- Hey!
- This is how you make it exciting.

838
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,640
- Jong Kook!
- This is thrilling.

839
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,310
Come here, the door is open.

840
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,380
- What?
- The door is open.

841
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,540
The door is open?

842
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,180
This door is open.

843
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,380
- Give me a hand.
- Okay, get on top of me.

844
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,480
- Help her.
- Okay.

845
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,640
The door is open?

846
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,420
It's open over here.

847
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,410
- I'm sorry, Jong Kook.
- It's okay.

848
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,240
- Step on me.
- Shouldn't Jae Seok go in?

849
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,310
- Will you be okay?
- I'll go in first.

850
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,140
- Be careful.
- Don't touch anything.

851
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,090
- Hey, Ji Hyo!
- Goodness.

852
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,440
- Be careful.
- Oh no.

853
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,940
Ji Hyo!

854
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,410
- Ji Hyo!
- Come in.

855
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:10,780
This is a crime scene.

856
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,240
Ji Hyo don't touch anything.

857
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,540
Don't touch anything.

858
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,240
Don't touch anything!

859
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,580
(The manager's death)

860
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,350
(Who did it?)

861
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,140
(When?)

862
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,740
(Why?)

863
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,240
(Gary, Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Haha)

864
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,030
(Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, Kwang Soo)

865
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,940
(The secrets are getting bigger.)

866
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,150
I saw someone who was brutally eliminated.

867
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,710
It was inhumane.

868
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,940
(The members investigate the crime scene.)

869
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,610
- Goodness.
- It smells.

870
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,840
First, let's take a look.

871
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,880
(They will investigate in three teams.)

872
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,650
First, let's take a look at the manager.

873
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,410
He's right-handed.

874
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,940
(He has ketchup on his right hand. He must be right-handed.)

875
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,240
We have to figure out...

876
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,650
what he was trying to write on the floor.

877
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,640
What letter is it?

878
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,380
He wrote it twice.

879
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,710
He started from here...

880
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,380
and stopped here.

881
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,840
Then he went straight.

882
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,650
Aren't I right? He stopped here.

883
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,320
He went like this.

884
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,940
I don't think it was just...

885
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,930
any letter.

886
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,140
It might not be someone's name.

887
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,540
It could be a symbol.

888
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:48,910
Or it could be something else.

889
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,110
What do you think happened?

890
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,110
Don't we have to find out...

891
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:58,040
what these letters are? What can they be?

892
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,840
Wait, look.

893
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,040
Does it say Kwang Soo?

894
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,650
Isn't it written backwards?

895
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,110
Kwang Soo.

896
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:09,440
(Kwang Soo)

897
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,310
Did you see the dying message?

898
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,640
(Did you see the dying message?)

899
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,740
What is that?

900
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,380
(What is that?)

901
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,880
What is that?

902
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,480
Is it the title of a movie?

903
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,740
(Is it the title of a movie?)

904
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,140
What is a dying message?

905
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,880
(Is it a new form of SNS?)

906
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,580
(Seok Jin, Gary and Haha investigate.)

907
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,410
This is creepy.

908
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:34,240
I've seen numerous crime scenes, but this one is really bad.

909
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:36,480
I found hair.

910
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,710
I see hair.

911
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:40,540
Isn't it a woman's hair?

912
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:44,940
Long strands of hair were stuck to the name tag.

913
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,240
There's a big chance...

914
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:52,030
that the suspect is a woman.

915
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,340
I have a few scenarios in my mind.

916
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,240
One is that Ga Yeon...

917
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:59,140
could've staged it.

918
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,610
(Ga Yeon could have staged the whole thing.)

919
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,250
I think...

920
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,480
that's the most plausible scenario.

921
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,350
The manager wrote two letters before he died.

922
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,240
It could be...

923
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,920
K for Kim and G for Ga.

924
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,440
I think she staged it herself.

925
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,840
That's...

926
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,810
what I think for now.

927
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,140
Wait a minute.

928
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,540
- It's either Ji Hyo and Ga Yeon.
- Ji Hyo.

929
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,440
But it's hard for a woman to eliminate a man.

930
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,640
(It's hard for a woman to eliminate a man.)

931
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,850
How can a woman knock down this big man?

932
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,910
(Seok Jin predicts that the suspect must have an accomplice.)

933
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,430
Wow.

934
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:39,740
- Seok Jin is really...
- Don't you agree?

935
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,850
(Seok Jin is on a roll today.)

936
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,540
He's a great detective today.

937
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,840
The crime wasn't committed alone.

938
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,210
I think that...

939
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,940
two women were in it together.

940
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,310
And that is because...

941
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,650
women love diamonds.

942
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,240
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo thoroughly investigate the scene.)

943
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,240
What's this?

944
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,740
What Is this?

945
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,040
Turbo!

946
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,340
Seok Jin's CD is here as well.

947
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,840
There's Leessang's CD, too.

948
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:22,480
Why is Haha's CD missing?

949
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:25,210
Right?

950
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,440
- Kwang Soo, look.
- Yes?

951
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,030
Hold on.

952
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,540
What is this?

953
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,740
Look, Kwang Soo.

954
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,910
- Giraffe, grasshopper.
- It's not me.

955
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,110
("Run, Grasshopper", "Giraffe That Cries Cock-a-Doodle-Doo")

956
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:45,080
Kwang Soo... Kwang Soo...

957
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,350
("The Story of Kwang Soo and Hwa Ni")

958
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:49,490
- There's a book with Haha, too.
- Haha.

959
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,740
Kwang Soo and Hwa Ni...

960
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,440
(Is he the suspect?)

961
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,610
I have goose bumps right now.

962
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,350
(I have goose bumps right now.)

963
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:01,540
I can't believe I was in the same room as the suspect.

964
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,110
(I can't believe I was in the same room as the suspect.)

965
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,030
I think the suspect would've...

966
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,910
gotten rid of all the evidence...

967
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:12,650
that leads to him.

968
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:17,350
Inside the room, there was Turbo's CD, Seok Jin's CD...

969
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,770
and Leessang's CD. Those were the three CDs in the room.

970
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,240
And on the books,

971
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,540
were the names of Haha, me and...

972
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,910
Jae Seok. There were three names.

973
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,510
But there was absolutely no evidence...

974
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,240
relating to Ji Hyo.

975
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,710
(There was no evidence relating to Ji Hyo.)

976
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,540
When you take the long strand of hair into account.

977
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,340
When you think of the long strand of hair on the name tag,

978
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,740
I am certain that it's Ji Hyo.

979
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,440
(He's certain that it's Ji Hyo.)

980
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,640
- Isn't it right?
- Oh no!

981
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,740
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

982
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,040
- This is crazy. I got the chills.
- Why?

983
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,110
What happened?

984
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,440
(They enter the manager's master bedroom.)

985
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,840
Oh my!

986
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,080
- No way.
- Oh my goodness.

987
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,440
(Goodness!)

988
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,540
Look at the pictures!

989
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,340
(What is the password for the safe with the diamond necklace inside?)

990
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:07,740
- So the manager...
- Is he the thief?

991
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:12,080
was very interested in the necklace.

992
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,440
- Right?
- From the very beginning.

993
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,120
Hold on.

994
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,350
"What's the password?"

995
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:21,020
Baekriyang Unit 10?

996
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,240
Master key, okay.

997
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,390
(Baekriyang Unit 10, master key okay)

998
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:27,310
Baekriyang is the name of the cabin owner's room.

999
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,540
- Is that right?
- Yes.

1000
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,640
I see.

1001
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,240
(Is the manager the thief?)

1002
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,210
Then why did he get eliminated?

1003
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:36,740
Oh my goodness!

1004
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,740
The 26th!

1005
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,710
- That's today.
- Today was D-day.

1006
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:44,110
He planned it. He planned to rob the diamond necklace.

1007
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,350
The date of the newspaper is the 26th,

1008
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,440
and he didn't pick it up.

1009
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,940
That means he didn't get to come out of the house.

1010
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,440
He never got out of the house in the morning.

1011
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,010
The fact that he didn't pick up today's newspaper this morning,

1012
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:58,440
but he has all the newspapers from the previous dates.

1013
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,640
That means something happened between last night and this morning.

1014
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,890
The person who stayed all night with him is the suspect.

1015
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,740
Someone who stayed all night with him.

1016
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,540
Then that makes a strange situation. Our members...

1017
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,040
(Meanwhile, Ga Yeon's situation)

1018
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,940
Oh dear.

1019
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,650
What?

1020
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,520
(Huffing)

1021
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,540
I can't believe this.

1022
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,940
(Hurrying outside)

1023
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,140
- This is a crime scene.
- He has the master key for...

1024
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,790
Baekriyang Unit 10?

1025
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,240
Look!

1026
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,540
It's a reminder.

1027
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,640
(Reminder)

1028
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,940
- It's a reminder of his debts.
- Oh wow.

1029
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,640
- He owes 500,000 dollars.
- He was...

1030
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,740
- in severe debt.
- It's 500,000 dollars of debt.

1031
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,710
After seeing the manager's room,

1032
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,520
I got the chills.

1033
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,910
What did you see there?

1034
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:57,310
The manager was in huge debt,

1035
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,940
and he was eyeing...

1036
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:03,910
the cabin owner's diamond necklace.

1037
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,740
D-day for robbery was the 26th.

1038
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,340
Which is today.

1039
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,980
However, before he was able to act,

1040
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,040
he was eliminated.

1041
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,040
(Seok Jin predicts that the manager was eliminated yesterday.)

1042
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,480
That's why I'm confused.

1043
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,640
- I'm so scared.
- The manager is...

1044
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,740
(It gives them chills to think about it.)

1045
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,350
The manager...

1046
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,110
- The manager...
- Goodness.

1047
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,350
What's wrong with you? He's Mister Fart.

1048
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:26,740
Mister Fart...

1049
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,820
exploded again!

1050
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,040
(Moving)

1051
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,110
Seok Jin farted again!

1052
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,010
(He returned from death thanks to Seok Jin's fart.)

1053
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,020
Wait a minute.

1054
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,150
The master key is missing.

1055
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,710
- You're right.
- The master key is missing.

1056
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,650
Someone has the master key.

1057
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:50,540
I need to check the members' rooms first.

1058
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,940
I might find the necklace.

1059
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,910
(He might find the necklace in the members' rooms.)

1060
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,910
I need to check my room as well.

1061
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,140
Where are you going?

1062
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,310
- I'm going to check the rooms.
- There are three suspicious people.

1063
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,350
I'm going to search their rooms.

1064
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:09,440
(They go in a group to search the members' rooms.)

1065
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,840
- What is this?
- Behind you.

1066
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,240
Wait, hold on.

1067
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,940
The CD on the bed was...

1068
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,850
Leessang's second album.

1069
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:17,310
Turbo's second album was there, too.

1070
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:19,010
- Is that Seok Jin's second album?
- Are they all our second albums?

1071
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:21,240
- It's my second album.
- So they are all second albums.

1072
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,440
- Really?
- They are all second albums.

1073
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,350
- Really? The second album?
- I got goose bumps.

1074
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,740
- The second album.
- They are all the second album.

1075
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,850
(Whose room should I search first?)

1076
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:30,940
Goodness, this is mind-blowing.

1077
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,840
- There's nothing.
- You are Unit Two!

1078
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,240
(Kwang Soo's room is Unit Two.)

1079
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,640
Wait a minute.

1080
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,440
(Jae Seok guesses that the suspect is related to the number two.)

1081
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,710
- Kwang Soo is in Unit Two!
- That's not it!

1082
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:46,980
- Kwang Soo is in Unit Two!
- Kwang Soo is the suspect.

1083
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,980
And his last name is Lee too.

1084
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,640
- That's right.
- His last name is Lee.

1085
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,340
It's not me.

1086
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,240
There's only one member with the last name, Lee.

1087
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,440
(The members begin to investigate Kwang Soo's room)

1088
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,040
Something is strange.

1089
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,140
Look!

1090
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,910
Look at this!

1091
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:12,340
There is a long strand of hair. Don't touch it.

1092
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,010
Bring the camera and film this.

1093
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:17,380
There's a long strand of hair.

1094
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,540
(They continue to investigate Kwang Soo's room.)

1095
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:23,420
He wouldn't have put the diamond here.

1096
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,410
There has to be something.

1097
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:27,940
Look!

1098
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:32,140
(What's that?)

1099
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:34,540
What's that?

1100
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,140
(That key is...)

1101
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,310
It's the master key!

1102
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:40,010
(It's the master key.)

1103
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,440
(Why is the master key...)

1104
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,110
(in Kwang Soo's room?)

1105
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:45,110
- It's the master key.
- Let me see.

1106
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,840
- It was hanging here.
- Really?

1107
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,510
(Is Kwang Soo the suspect?)

1108
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:51,010
(Previously on Running Man)

1109
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:52,140
It's a real party.

1110
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,980
- My necklace disappeared.
- The necklace?

1111
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:56,140
Let's investigate the area.

1112
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,040
Have you seen anyone near the cabin owner's room?

1113
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:02,040
The manager collapsed on the floor!

1114
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,140
- What's this?
- It's the master key!

1115
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,110
(Who is the suspect of the mountain cabin crime?)

1116
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:07,840
(Gary, Yu Jae Seok)

1117
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,010
(Jee Seok Jin, Haha)

1118
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:10,110
(Kim Jong Kook, Song Ji Hyo, Lee Kwang Soo)

1119
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,440
(Evidence or Tricks)

1120
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,340
So...

1121
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:20,110
people suspected me all day.

1122
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:22,900
All the alibis and evidence...

1123
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,240
pointed at me.

1124
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,640
The master key was hanging in my room.

1125
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,440
(All the evidence pointed to him.)

1126
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,740
So many things happened. However,

1127
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,540
it's the suspect who set this whole thing up.

1128
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,040
- It's a setup?
- Yes.

1129
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,440
- Really?
- The master key was hanging here.

1130
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,040
Really? Come here.

1131
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,340
- How dare you!
- Come here.

1132
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,910
Confess.

1133
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:45,810
- Confess already.
- How does he have the master key?

1134
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,340
- I can't believe it.
- I didn't see that.

1135
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,710
And like this, we have now caught the suspect.

1136
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,640
- Jae Seok, call the police.
- Yes?

1137
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,340
Let's listen to what he has to say.

1138
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,840
- Jong Kook.
- Leave the key and tell us.

1139
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,500
Why is the key here?

1140
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,740
- This?
- Right.

1141
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:58,810
I don't know either.

1142
00:45:58,810 --> 00:45:59,910
(Punching)

1143
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:01,980
What is this? He really punched me.

1144
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,180
- Jong Kook, don't hurt him.
- I really got hit!

1145
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,240
Think again.

1146
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,340
- Kwang Soo, think again.
- The police will come soon.

1147
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,740
- Why is this here?
- What happened?

1148
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:09,840
- What?
- What did you say?

1149
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,220
- He really hit me.
- I didn't see it.

1150
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,140
What? How could he do this?

1151
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,640
- Wait a minute.
- Is this a scene from a movie?

1152
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,010
- Hold on.
- What is it?

1153
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:18,540
- Continue the investigation.
- Okay.

1154
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,940
Calm down, everyone.

1155
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,440
- Tell us the truth.
- That hurts!

1156
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,340
- Kwang Soo.
- Why are you hitting me?

1157
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,910
- Why is this here?
- Who hit you?

1158
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:27,310
Why are you all so immersed in this situation?

1159
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:29,710
So tell us why the master key is here.

1160
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:30,980
Tell us quickly.

1161
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,640
- Why is it here?
- I really don't know.

1162
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,840
- All right.
- That hurts.

1163
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,980
(Then we will wait until you figure it out.)

1164
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,310
- I know.
- He's really hitting me!

1165
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:39,610
- What's wrong, Sir?
- He's really hitting me!

1166
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:41,040
The camera is filming you. Watch what you say.

1167
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,910
- He's really hitting me!
- Hold on.

1168
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:44,210
- Kwang Soo.
- Let's just talk like this.

1169
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:46,310
- Producer Lim!
- Don't worry.

1170
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:48,810
- No one's hitting anyone.
- Producer Lim!

1171
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,640
- Why do you have the key?
- Producer Lim!

1172
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,240
- Why is the key here?
- Why do you have this key?

1173
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,540
- Tell us.
- Wait, listen to me.

1174
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:55,810
At least give us an idea.

1175
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:57,980
- An idea.
- If I am the suspect,

1176
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,140
do you think I will put the key in a place that is so easily visible?

1177
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:01,540
What does that matter?

1178
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:05,440
- That's it.
- You're right.

1179
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,340
- He's got a point.
- Jong Kook, he has a point.

1180
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,040
- Let's think carefully.
- He's got a point.

1181
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,180
- If I am the suspect,
- He has a point.

1182
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,440
- That's true.
- I wouldn't put the keys in a...

1183
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,810
- place where you can see them.
- You're right.

1184
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:15,140
You make sense.

1185
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,710
- Right.
- This feels like a setup.

1186
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,210
But why is this key here?

1187
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,240
- Isn't it so strange?
- If I were you,

1188
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,540
- It seems like a setup.
- I would look at the key...

1189
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:27,040
- and know that I'm not the suspect.
- It does seem like a setup.

1190
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,680
This key was missing from the janitor's key box.

1191
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,140
- It does seem like a setup.
- This key is important.

1192
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:38,640
Who was Ga Yeon most interested in today?

1193
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,210
- Jong Kook.
- Exactly.

1194
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:41,410
They like each other.

1195
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:43,140
If we were in a movie,

1196
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,840
- Jong Kook must be the culprit.
- It's possible.

1197
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,040
That makes sense.

1198
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,240
- Then am I done now?
- Wait.

1199
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,450
- I just remembered something.
- What is it?

1200
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:52,840
- Seok Jin.
- Yes.

1201
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,310
(Jae Seok asks Seok Jin a question.)

1202
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:57,040
The prices of the stocks you invested in...

1203
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,340
are dropping, aren't they?

1204
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,220
- Really?
- Wait.

1205
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,240
The prices were going down.

1206
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,580
- Wait.
- Look.

1207
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,040
What's going on?

1208
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,340
He's suspicious.

1209
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,540
- I'm innocent.
- Let me repeat.

1210
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:09,940
- The prices are dropping.
- Hold him.

1211
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,680
- What happened to your stocks?
- He's...

1212
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,840
- He's the most...
- Tell us about your stocks

1213
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,240
- Tell us.
- Listen.

1214
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,580
- It wasn't...
- Speak towards the camera.

1215
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,040
I took a peep...

1216
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,440
(Beating)

1217
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,540
Are you okay?

1218
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:21,640
Oh, my.

1219
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,420
I looked at the stock prices.

1220
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,610
I looked at the prices of his stocks.

1221
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:27,240
They're really not doing well.

1222
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,580
They were all dropping.

1223
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,540
- Do you remember anything?
- Seok Jin.

1224
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,810
- Do you recall anything?
- Seok Jin.

1225
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:33,640
I'm innocent.

1226
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,910
My situation is not so bad that I have to steal a necklace.

1227
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:39,090
Doesn't your wife love jewellery?

1228
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:40,340
- You two got new rings.
- She does.

1229
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:41,840
- She does, right?
- Yes.

1230
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,110
See?

1231
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:45,630
Everything points to him.

1232
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,810
- It's over now.
- It's over.

1233
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:50,410
I have another critical clue.

1234
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:53,110
- We had a conversation earlier.
- Stop it.

1235
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:54,640
He told me,

1236
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,680
"To be honest, I tried to open the safe."

1237
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,940
He said that...

1238
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,410
- Really?
- to make us believe...

1239
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:03,840
- that he's not the culprit.
- Right.

1240
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,210
It was his trick.

1241
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,240
One more thing.

1242
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,640
There was a reason...

1243
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,040
why he farted so much today.

1244
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,710
It was because he was nervous.

1245
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:18,140
It might be because he ate so much meat.

1246
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,580
(Is it the meat or is it because he was nervous?)

1247
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,730
He ate too much meat.

1248
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:24,200
Do you know what that means?

1249
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,780
- It means...
- He's a greedy pig!

1250
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:29,040
- Hey.
- I'm serious!

1251
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,540
- I wasn't going to say that.
- You're being too harsh.

1252
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,840
I didn't mean it.

1253
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,510
I'm sorry.

1254
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:35,540
- It does seem...
- Somebody set him up.

1255
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,040
like somebody set Kwang Soo up.

1256
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,340
Our prime suspects...

1257
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,020
are...

1258
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,840
- Is it Kwang Soo?
- these three.

1259
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,000
Jae Seok found the key.

1260
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,440
It was found in Kwang Soo's room.

1261
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,610
And Gary was the last one to be here.

1262
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:51,840
- You're spot on.
- You're perceptive.

1263
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,040
Then we're not suspected.

1264
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,740
I'm just speaking my opinion.

1265
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,910
And there's someone that's the most suspicious.

1266
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,610
Why do you talk so much?

1267
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:00,310
- Why do you suspect everyone?
- He talks too much!

1268
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:02,140
- Wait.
- You're being suspicious.

1269
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,580
This is crazy.

1270
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:04,740
It's strange.

1271
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,310
He doesn't usually talk this much.

1272
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:08,710
- He's talking too much.
- He's being strange.

1273
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:11,340
Does he think he's Sherlock Holmes?

1274
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:13,140
He's talking way too much.

1275
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,340
- What did he say?
- He said he's innocent.

1276
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,640
Wait.

1277
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,440
You were talking a lot, too. He talked more than me.

1278
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,110
You made us suspect him.

1279
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:21,780
It was strange.

1280
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,140
He talked too much.

1281
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,810
It was too obvious.

1282
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:27,240
(At 8:00pm, Ji Hyo is investigating.)

1283
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,310
This hair was found on the name tag.

1284
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:32,340
This must belong to a woman.

1285
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:34,640
There must be an accomplice.

1286
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,610
Let me pull out just one. Done.

1287
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:38,940
(Will it help find the culprit?)

1288
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,240
- Why did she pull out her hair?
- It takes long to grow one.

1289
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,940
(Ji Hyo obtained the cleaning lady's hair.)

1290
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:46,140
(She's going to compare it with the one in the janitor's room.)

1291
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,040
Let's see.

1292
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,240
The length is not right.

1293
00:50:58,610 --> 00:50:59,940
They're different lengths.

1294
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,440
(They're different lengths.)

1295
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:03,940
The length is not right.

1296
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,410
(Then who does this hair belong to?)

1297
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:08,010
It's not the same.

1298
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,240
(Meanwhile, Gary...)

1299
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,710
Lee Kwang Soo.

1300
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,440
Kwang Soo was suspected once.

1301
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:23,440
So was Jae Seok.

1302
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:28,840
This car wasn't here before.

1303
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,740
(Gary found a suspicious car...)

1304
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:36,740
(with initials "GY" on it.)

1305
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,610
Let's see.

1306
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:43,140
(Gary examines the car.)

1307
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:52,140
(What is this?)

1308
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,740
Wait.

1309
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,340
(Gary found a picture in the car.)

1310
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:04,840
(Will this give Gary a hint?)

1311
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:08,580
(At 8:20pm, Jae Seok is pondering.)

1312
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:11,140
Who would have left the key in Kwang Soo's room?

1313
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:17,940
(Jae Seok visits the information office...)

1314
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,780
(to find out the secret about the key.)

1315
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:21,540
Let me ask you a question.

1316
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:25,240
Who are you suspecting?

1317
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:27,510
- I had been unsure...
- Okay.

1318
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,140
until I found...

1319
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,940
(Until I found...)

1320
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,110
a critical...

1321
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:34,640
(a critical...)

1322
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,780
- clue.
- Okay.

1323
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:38,400
Tell me about it.

1324
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,840
I looked at the guestbook...

1325
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,990
that the janitor had kept.

1326
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:44,510
- In the guestbook...
- Okay.

1327
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:47,240
for the day before the incident,

1328
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,240
there was a critical clue.

1329
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,940
(There was a critical clue.)

1330
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:55,940
(He visited the janitor's office before the police arrived.)

1331
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:57,210
Excuse me.

1332
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:00,040
- Could I see the guestbook?
- Sure.

1333
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,440
Thank you.

1334
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:07,080
(Looking carefully)

1335
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,740
25th.

1336
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:15,140
"Sibling" visited on 25th.

1337
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,910
(He found a name "Sibling" among the visitors on the 25th.)

1338
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:19,450
Everyone else wrote his or her real name.

1339
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:21,600
But this one says "Sibling".

1340
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,940
"Sibling"?

1341
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,640
(Her sibling was here yesterday?)

1342
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,240
"Sibling"?

1343
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,840
What would that mean?

1344
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:32,840
Why didn't I realise it before?

1345
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,340
(Why didn't I realise it before?)

1346
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,340
What would "Sibling" mean?

1347
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,580
(What would "Sibling" mean?)

1348
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,340
It means he's younger than her.

1349
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:41,040
(It means he's younger than her.)

1350
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,040
That excludes Seok Jin and me.

1351
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,780
Jong Kook, Kwang Soo, Gary, Haha and Ji Hyo...

1352
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:49,840
(The culprit must be younger than Ga Yeon.)

1353
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,940
are younger than Ga Yeon.

1354
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,840
That's why he wrote "Sibling".

1355
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,110
(One of the younger ones was here yesterday.)

1356
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,120
I'm not really sure.

1357
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:02,720
We don't have enough clues. If it's one of us,

1358
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,310
it must be Ji Hyo.

1359
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:07,110
Or it could be Ga Yeon...

1360
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:11,040
or the cleaning lady who stole the key.

1361
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,510
(Judging from the hair found in the room, it must be a woman.)

1362
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:15,040
(Ji Hyo came to Kwang Soo's room.)

1363
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,340
- Seok Jin.
- Yes.

1364
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,610
Have you found anything?

1365
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:19,710
The key was found here.

1366
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,410
- Really?
- Yes.

1367
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:23,940
(Ji Hyo realised the key was in Kwang Soo's room.)

1368
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,240
But it didn't feel right.

1369
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,440
- Seok Jin.
- He must not have done that.

1370
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,710
- Look.
- Okay.

1371
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:30,940
I'm the only one...

1372
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:34,110
whose name was not in the book.

1373
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:36,400
And there was a woman's hair.

1374
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,710
- Do you understand?
- The circumstances point to you.

1375
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,610
They do. But I'm innocent.

1376
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,240
I think it's neither you nor Kwang Soo.

1377
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,040
I think this whole thing was staged by Ga Yeon.

1378
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,340
I thought so too.

1379
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,240
- I do think so.
- She's after the insurance money.

1380
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,440
Seok Jin.

1381
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:51,640
Seok Jin!

1382
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,240
- Yes.
- Are we to point out the culprit?

1383
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,640
Yes, we are.

1384
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,210
- When the police are here?
- Yes.

1385
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,780
But we don't have much clues.

1386
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,140
Everything points to Ji Hyo.

1387
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:00,540
Wait.

1388
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:01,840
(They're having a discussion.)

1389
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,110
- What if...
- Yes.

1390
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:04,410
the janitor's actually not dead?

1391
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:06,410
- I hear a scream.
- Gosh.

1392
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:07,810
- Help!
- This is scary.

1393
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:10,010
Someone's dead!

1394
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,040
(They heard a scream.)

1395
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,740
- What?
- What?

1396
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:16,340
- Someone's dead.
- Who is it?

1397
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,810
- Hurry!
- Someone's dead.

1398
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:19,340
Someone's dead.

1399
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,140
Who is it?

1400
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,710
What happened?

1401
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,780
- Where is it?
- It's here!

1402
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,710
- Is someone dead?
- Yes!

1403
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:32,740
- Hurry!
- Preserve the scene!

1404
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:35,240
Preserve the scene!

1405
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,240
- Oh.
- What happened?

1406
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,640
Preserve the scene!

1407
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,510
It's the cleaning lady.

1408
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,640
(Shocking)

1409
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,040
(In the laundry room,)

1410
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,780
(with her name tag ripped off,)

1411
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,740
(a lady is lying on the floor.)

1412
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,410
(Cleaning Lady)

1413
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:58,880
(Signs of struggle)

1414
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:00,780
Preserve the scene!

1415
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:03,240
(This lady...)

1416
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:07,040
We found a woman's hair.

1417
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:11,140
Are you saying you think that hair belongs to me?

1418
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:15,540
(Why did this happen to her?)

1419
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,840
Preserve the scene!

1420
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,040
It's the cleaning lady.

1421
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,540
- Gosh.
- Preserve the scene.

1422
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:21,940
- Preserve the scene.
- Preserve the scene.

1423
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:23,740
- Preserve the scene.
- Don't make a fuss.

1424
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:26,140
- Who found her?
- When was she found?

1425
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:27,410
Who found her?

1426
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:29,240
- I just got here...
- Okay.

1427
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,840
- and found her.
- I see.

1428
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,840
- I came here to get some blankets.
- Okay.

1429
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,410
- Look for evidence.
- Wait.

1430
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:37,040
(They're busy investigating.)

1431
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,840
- Examine the scene.
- Wait.

1432
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,640
Before she died,

1433
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,910
she might have left a message.

1434
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,940
We shouldn't touch her.

1435
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,440
Is there anything?

1436
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,640
- Can we touch her?
- Do you see anything?

1437
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,940
- We shouldn't touch her.
- Is there anything?

1438
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,570
Can we touch her?

1439
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:56,910
- Do you see anything?
- She had the key.

1440
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:58,240
What is that?

1441
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,140
- Oh.
- She has some pictures.

1442
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:02,010
(Will they find any evidence in her phone?)

1443
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:05,840
Let's look at the pictures.

1444
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,040
- Hey!
- It was taken here.

1445
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,240
It was taken here.

1446
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,740
She's wearing the necklace.

1447
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:10,840
Let me see.

1448
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,580
- My goodness.
- Show me.

1449
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,680
She's wearing the necklace.

1450
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,840
It's the necklace.

1451
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:21,310
(A picture of her wearing the necklace was taken at 8:57pm.)

1452
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:22,640
Was the janitor here?

1453
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,410
Were they in a relationship?

1454
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:25,580
No.

1455
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:29,340
The person tried the necklace on the lady.

1456
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:30,610
(The necklace is missing at the moment.)

1457
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:32,310
The person tried it on her.

1458
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:34,540
The person let her try it on and she took a photo.

1459
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,380
To falsely lay the blame on her.

1460
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,640
Because after she tried it on...

1461
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,730
- So she just tried it on?
- That's right.

1462
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,040
- Then she took a selfie.
- It's a trick.

1463
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,340
- It's a trick.
- This is a trick.

1464
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,040
- She's not the thief.
- It's to pin the blame on her.

1465
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,840
To make her look like the thief.

1466
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,280
- Look,
- Because it's not us.

1467
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,640
first it was Kwang Soo, then now it's the cleaning lady.

1468
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,440
Who's the one person that didn't appear?

1469
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,840
It's the owner.

1470
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,240
So all we need to do is go to her.

1471
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,740
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's go.

1472
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,040
(Wait a minute.)

1473
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,240
Is this the office?

1474
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,640
Look!

1475
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,540
- In the list of the calls she made,
- Yes?

1476
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:06,040
there's Ga Yeon.

1477
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,840
- You're right.
- Did she make the call or take it?

1478
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,080
- When was it?
- At 9:03pm.

1479
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,540
It was 30 minutes ago.

1480
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:14,920
So this lady was alive 30 minutes ago.

1481
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,540
This is scary.

1482
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:19,940
This is really breathtaking.

1483
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,640
It really is.

1484
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,740
But it's strange that the lady tried the necklace on...

1485
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,940
and took a selfie...

1486
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,240
just because she was asked to.

1487
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,340
- Would you have tried it on?
- Let me see the photo again.

1488
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,940
She might have liked how it looked on her.

1489
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:34,440
- This is all set up to make it...
- Exactly.

1490
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,740
look like she's the thief.

1491
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:37,610
It's possible to have taken the photo.

1492
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:39,010
All we need to do is confront the owner.

1493
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:40,410
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's go.

1494
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:41,640
- Wait.
- Look.

1495
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,110
Why?

1496
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,740
- There was a missed call?
- Yes.

1497
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:46,940
- Let me see.
- Who was it?

1498
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,440
Don't hide it.

1499
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,540
Look at the missed calls.

1500
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,280
- Let us see.
- Show it to us.

1501
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,440
- Show us.
- Hurry.

1502
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,540
Why are you trying to hide it?

1503
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:54,640
It's not that.

1504
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,280
- You should be careful, Kwang Soo.
- Show it to us.

1505
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,120
- You should be careful.
- Hey.

1506
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,380
- Come here.
- Come over here.

1507
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:01,640
- It's not that.
- You're really strange.

1508
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,810
You saw that I was surprised.

1509
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:05,540
I was surprised.

1510
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,910
- It's from the owner.
- Ga Yeon?

1511
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:09,240
- Look at this.
- Wait a minute.

1512
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,140
I was surprised, too.

1513
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,380
- Hey.
- I was surprised like everyone.

1514
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,210
- What's your deal?
- I was surprised.

1515
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:16,640
What is your relationship with her?

1516
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,540
I think this is a setup too.

1517
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:19,840
- This is a setup.
- Don't you think so?

1518
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,540
I'm being set up.

1519
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:23,440
But how on earth did...

1520
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,040
- Why?
- There's a hairpin.

1521
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,240
We saw that already.

1522
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,730
You did?

1523
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,540
- You saw it already?
- It doesn't really...

1524
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,040
mean anything.

1525
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,940
There's another hairpin here too.

1526
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,310
(What is the meaning of the hairpins lying around the scene?)

1527
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:38,410
Do the hairpins have any significant meaning?

1528
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:40,510
- At 8:57pm...
- There's another hairpin here.

1529
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:50,140
(The clue of the selfie that was taken at 8:57pm.)

1530
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:51,690
The first photo...

1531
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:54,640
was taken at 8:57pm.

1532
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,960
(Six minutes later, she gets a call from Ga Yeon.)

1533
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,040
The lady didn't steal it.

1534
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,340
It wasn't her.

1535
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,810
I think we need to meet the owner first.

1536
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,940
I have to meet her first.

1537
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,240
(He walks over to Ga Yeon's room in an instant.)

1538
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,940
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

1539
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:17,840
(At this instant,)

1540
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,310
(we would like to hear an explanation from you.)

1541
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,480
(What is he doing here?)

1542
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:30,280
(He realises instantly that something fishy is going on.)

1543
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,740
Did you cook ramyun?

1544
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,680
(Did you cook ramyun?)

1545
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:35,410
(She laughs.)

1546
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:37,040
Did you?

1547
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,710
Excuse me.

1548
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:41,380
- Yes?
- You had the time...

1549
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,740
to cook ramyun?

1550
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:45,810
Do you feel better now?

1551
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,310
I'm still knocked out.

1552
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,940
(How could she eat something?)

1553
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:52,110
(Losing the necklace is already done and over.)

1554
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:53,810
I haven't had ramyun in a long time.

1555
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:55,210
(A person needs to eat.)

1556
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:56,940
Ga Yeon.

1557
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:58,340
(This is embarrassing.)

1558
01:00:58,810 --> 01:01:00,740
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1559
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,710
- Ga Yeon.
- Yes?

1560
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:04,720
- Please answer this question.
- Okay.

1561
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,810
The cleaning lady...

1562
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:08,740
has been found dead.

1563
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,950
When did she die?

1564
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:14,540
The presumed time of her death is between 9:10pm and 9:33pm.

1565
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:15,940
But it seems that...

1566
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:18,840
you talked to the cleaning lady over the phone.

1567
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,140
- We did have a talk.
- Yes?

1568
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:23,240
(Let's have a look.)

1569
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:26,900
Anyways, wasn't it...

1570
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,180
- at 9:06pm?
- Yes, that's right.

1571
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:30,410
She called me at that time and we had a talk.

1572
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:33,540
- What did she say?
- Since there were a lot of...

1573
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:36,640
barbecue parties today, she had worked overtime.

1574
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,630
She asked how much more pay she would receive.

1575
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:40,720
The lady took a photo...

1576
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,740
of herself wearing the necklace.

1577
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:43,940
(Goodness!)

1578
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,480
- Really?
- Yes.

1579
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:48,240
Didn't you talk for a minute on the phone?

1580
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,840
- No, that's not true.
- Was that all she said?

1581
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,520
- Yes.
- I have another question.

1582
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,440
Do you have a sibling?

1583
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,640
No, I don't.

1584
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,310
- You don't?
- I don't.

1585
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:58,910
Someone checked in as your sibling on the guestbook.

1586
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:01,110
No, I'm the only child.

1587
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:03,640
If someone checked in as your sibling,

1588
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:07,040
on the 25th, the person must be very close to you.

1589
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,440
I think it must be someone you know.

1590
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,440
I don't remember. There's simply too many people.

1591
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,340
No, there was only one person.

1592
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:16,380
- Who was it?
- The person that came on the 25th.

1593
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,040
- Someone close enough.
- But it might be that...

1594
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,210
- What?
- Close friends...

1595
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:23,740
know that if they check in as a sibling,

1596
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,740
- they can receive a discount.
- Wait a minute.

1597
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:27,140
Yes?

1598
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,240
Why did you call Kwang Soo?

1599
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:34,140
(Blinking)

1600
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,980
That is what confuses me.

1601
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,540
I think Ga Yeon did that...

1602
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:44,740
to make an alibi.

1603
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:46,410
She called Kwang Soo,

1604
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:49,180
in order to make others...

1605
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,840
look more suspicious.

1606
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:55,110
She's a very bad person.

1607
01:02:57,810 --> 01:02:59,740
(Is Ga Yeon really...)

1608
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,040
(a bad person?)

1609
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,140
My goodness.

1610
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:06,240
- Hey.
- Yes?

1611
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,540
Didn't you stage this?

1612
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:08,880
- You should call me madam.
- I'm sorry.

1613
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,440
- All right, Madam.
- Yes?

1614
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,910
(Seok Jin suspects Ga Yeon.)

1615
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:14,310
- Aren't you tricking us?
- If I had the necklace insured...

1616
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:16,410
then it's possible, but I don't.

1617
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,840
- So there's no reason.
- Tell me who knows...

1618
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,110
- Yes?
- the password.

1619
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:23,140
- You're the only one that knows it.
- I don't know.

1620
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,810
You're the only one that knows the password.

1621
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:27,940
What's this?

1622
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:29,210
(What's this?)

1623
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:30,680
What is it?

1624
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,510
(Seok Jin hides it behind his back.)

1625
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:36,130
Yes?

1626
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:39,010
What is it?

1627
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:40,310
- Explain this.
- Wait.

1628
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:42,240
A theft insurance policy.

1629
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,840
This insurance policy...

1630
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,210
- Wait a minute.
- Ji Hyo,

1631
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:46,980
- you and I...
- Goodness.

1632
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,410
- Wait, what is this?
- What's this? Explain this.

1633
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:50,840
My father got this insurance without me knowing.

1634
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,110
Your father? Let me see.

1635
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:55,440
It's an insurance policy worth 10 million dollars.

1636
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,540
Really?

1637
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,240
- Yes, 10 million dollars.
- My goodness.

1638
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,810
Did you really not know?

1639
01:03:59,810 --> 01:04:01,110
I didn't know. I didn't sign it.

1640
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:02,540
Are you sure?

1641
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:04,640
I told you to look around before.

1642
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,340
But you told me there was nothing.

1643
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:09,910
Seok Jin, she's pretending to have the necklace stolen.

1644
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:11,640
- Then...
- But...

1645
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:15,210
it might be true that Ga Yeon didn't know about the insurance.

1646
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:16,840
I really didn't know.

1647
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,640
You didn't know you were insured?

1648
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,810
No, I didn't.

1649
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:22,740
(Is she telling the truth?)

1650
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:25,110
- I think...
- Yes?

1651
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:26,440
she plotted the whole thing.

1652
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,640
- You're right.
- She's fooling us.

1653
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,640
- Either that...
- There's the insurance.

1654
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,840
- or...
- Yes?

1655
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,540
her father...

1656
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:36,040
Her father?

1657
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,940
- got someone to do it.
- Hired someone.

1658
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,040
- Yes, hired someone to steal it.
- I think you're right.

1659
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,140
He must have hired one of the members.

1660
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:43,240
He hired someone...

1661
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,540
to steal the necklace.

1662
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:46,210
He told the person the password...

1663
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:48,140
- and let the person steal it.
- And...

1664
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:50,340
the guard and the cleaning lady are also...

1665
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:51,410
in on this. Losing the master key...

1666
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:53,040
was also staged.

1667
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:54,640
- That's right.
- Seok Jin.

1668
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,930
But who was hired to do it?

1669
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:58,280
- I think it's Jae Seok.
- It's Jae Seok, right?

1670
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,640
Yes.

1671
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:03,440
Do you have the phone number under the name "Sibling"?

1672
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,540
No, I don't have a sibling.

1673
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:09,040
I told you before that I don't have a sibling.

1674
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,340
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1675
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,210
Well then.

1676
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,680
All right.

1677
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:18,010
- Is that all?
- Yes.

1678
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,540
Come visit often.

1679
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:21,410
- All right.
- I'm bored.

1680
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:23,940
(She must be hiding something on her phone.)

1681
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:28,680
To be frank, you can't trust anyone in Running Man.

1682
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,080
Even if we say that we trust each other,

1683
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:35,140
we have doubts about the other person.

1684
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:39,110
Why is there a car out there?

1685
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:41,210
This is really baffling me.

1686
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:49,630
Gosh.

1687
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:52,010
Don't tell me it's in here.

1688
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:54,040
Please don't.

1689
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,840
Don't you dare come out.

1690
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:00,440
Since I received the invitation...

1691
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,140
(Since I received the invitation...)

1692
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:03,740
I'm the most suspicious person?

1693
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,310
(Then let's see that invitation letter again.)

1694
01:06:13,310 --> 01:06:14,740
This is an invitation to the mountain cabin.

1695
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:17,310
You have won a free voucher to lodge at our mountain cabin.

1696
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:21,680
The mountain cabin is located in Gyeonggi-do, Gapyeong.

1697
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:28,640
(Jae Seok is in search of the cell phone.)

1698
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:31,540
(He has arrived at the guard's room.)

1699
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,140
Excuse me.

1700
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:45,010
(The police are about to arrive.)

1701
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:47,280
(Everyone is trying to come to conclusions.)

1702
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,240
This isn't easy.

1703
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:53,440
(Whose bag is this?)

1704
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,940
(Invitation to our mountain cabin. Congratulations.)

1705
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:05,410
(He is carefully looking over the invitation letter.)

1706
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:08,210
(The letter is addressed to Kwang Soo from Running mountain cabin.)

1707
01:07:08,210 --> 01:07:09,720
Wait a minute.

1708
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,240
It was stamped in Mapo-gu?

1709
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:17,040
(The letter was sent from Mapo-gu, not Gapyeong.)

1710
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,430
It was here.

1711
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:23,150
It was over here.

1712
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:24,840
There was a cell phone here.

1713
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:40,540
Oh.

1714
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:41,840
(Look!)

1715
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,180
(Something is in here.)

1716
01:07:54,210 --> 01:07:55,950
Oh gosh.

1717
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:57,240
That was unexpected.

1718
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,840
(That was unexpected.)

1719
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,180
I found something crucial.

1720
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:04,010
I saw the insurance policy that the other members...

1721
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,740
didn't see.

1722
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:11,210
It could've been staged by the owner.

1723
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:14,540
(Did anyone find the real suspect?)

1724
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:21,640
This is how it was found out.

1725
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:25,180
This was it.

1726
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:27,240
(What is Jae Seok looking at?)

1727
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,950
(Gary is thinking hard.)

1728
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,210
This is crazy.

1729
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:38,080
(What did Gary see?)

1730
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:45,540
(The police is here.)

1731
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:50,810
(In order to solve this case,)

1732
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:52,740
(the police finally came...)

1733
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:54,540
(after four hours.)

1734
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:02,740
(They are here.)

1735
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:04,040
(Who is this?)

1736
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,540
No way!

1737
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,340
Sir!

1738
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:08,860
(Detective Yeom of Violent Crimes Department)

1739
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:10,640
It's the police. Wait a minute!

1740
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,040
How have you been, Doctor?

1741
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,740
(He played the doctor in the zombie episode.)

1742
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:17,950
Doctor! Salute!

1743
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:19,150
(Nice to see you again.)

1744
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:20,340
- How have you been?
- It's nice to see you again.

1745
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:22,150
- I switched jobs.
- I see.

1746
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:24,540
- I'm Detective Yeom.
- Hello, Sir.

1747
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:27,510
- Sir.
- Did you take the zombie medicine?

1748
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:30,040
- Doctor.
- You're alive.

1749
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,840
- Sir.
- You are alive, doctor.

1750
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:34,180
- Hi.
- I have a secret.

1751
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:36,740
- Hello.
- I'm a triplet.

1752
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:37,940
(The Yeom triplets)

1753
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:39,310
That was funny.

1754
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,650
Police! Police!

1755
01:09:41,650 --> 01:09:44,340
You're here. Why did you come...

1756
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:45,610
- so late?
- Wait.

1757
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:48,780
- Everyone listen.
- Okay.

1758
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:51,430
Do not share information with each other.

1759
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:54,240
You should only tell me what you know.

1760
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:58,610
You are all suspects and witnesses of the stolen...

1761
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:00,940
Tears of the Sun case.

1762
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:02,080
- Okay.
- We'll...

1763
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,650
- go to the inquisition room.
- Yes.

1764
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:04,740
- I'll start interrogating.
- Okay.

1765
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:05,940
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1766
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:10,510
(Who is the real suspect?)

1767
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:13,210
Congratulations, you won a free lodging event.

1768
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:15,280
My necklace disappeared! What am I going to do?

1769
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,540
Someone is unconscious!

1770
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:19,320
- The master key is missing.
- The master key?

1771
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,650
What's going on?

1772
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:22,380
It's a fake. He's not the culprit.

1773
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:24,580
- What does it say?
- Wait a minute.

1774
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:27,790
- They're toying with us.
- This is too much.

1775
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:29,840
This is how he knew.

1776
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,110
(Gary, Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Haha)

1777
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:32,540
(Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, Kwang Soo)

1778
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:35,380
How did you come here?

1779
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:37,580
I'm Kwang Soo's close friend.

1780
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,660
Kwang Soo asked me to come.

1781
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:43,650
As you know, a lot of things...

1782
01:10:43,650 --> 01:10:46,240
- happened at the mountain cabin.
- Yes.

1783
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,650
Who do you think...

1784
01:10:48,650 --> 01:10:51,410
the culprit is?

1785
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:53,740
Well, there are many suspects.

1786
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:55,240
(There are many suspects.)

1787
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:56,940
- If I had to choose someone,
- Yes.

1788
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:58,450
I'd choose Jae Seok and Kwang Soo.

1789
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:01,710
(Haha suspects Jae Seok and Kwang Soo.)

1790
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:03,480
What is your reasoning?

1791
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:07,910
When we were trying to solve the case together...

1792
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:09,940
and couldn't find an answer,

1793
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:11,440
we heard a scream.

1794
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,740
(There was a scream.)

1795
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:13,940
Everyone was there...

1796
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:15,650
Help!

1797
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:18,010
Everyone was there except Jae Seok and Kwang Soo.

1798
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:21,210
The "Out" incident happened then.

1799
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:22,740
(The "Out" incident happened then.)

1800
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:24,950
They weren't there.

1801
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:28,880
When the cleaning lady was tagged out,

1802
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,080
only Jae Seok and Kwang Soo...

1803
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,880
weren't at the scene.

1804
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:36,510
So do you suspect Jae Seok?

1805
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:39,080
Since we found out "Tears of the Sun"...

1806
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,650
was stolen,

1807
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:42,960
Jae Seok was on his own.

1808
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,640
Kwang Soo also...

1809
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:47,150
was on his own most of the times.

1810
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:48,540
(Kwang Soo was by himself a lot.)

1811
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:50,220
I suspect...

1812
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:53,810
Jae Seok and Kwang Soo.

1813
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:57,290
(Ji Hyo suspects Jae Seok and Kwang Soo.)

1814
01:11:57,290 --> 01:12:00,440
- The manager was also tagged out.
- Yes.

1815
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:04,540
According to the witness, there was an argument the day before...

1816
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:07,280
and the milk and newspaper dated January 26th...

1817
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,650
was left outside. That means...

1818
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:12,710
the manager was tagged out on the 25th...

1819
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:15,150
before the milk and the newspapers...

1820
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:16,440
were delivered.

1821
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,650
- The newspapers and the milk...
- Right.

1822
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:23,880
And inside the room there were...

1823
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,410
a lot of books that pointed to...

1824
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:30,280
Jae Seok and Kwang Soo.

1825
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:34,180
Haha, Kwang Soo, Jae Seok,

1826
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:37,950
Jong Kook, Turbo, Haha, Kwang Soo.

1827
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,310
What do you think is the truth?

1828
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:45,610
I don't know. But I saw...

1829
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:47,340
an insurance policy.

1830
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:48,980
- An insurance policy?
- Yes.

1831
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:52,340
But the owner didn't know...

1832
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:56,010
about the insurance policy.

1833
01:12:56,010 --> 01:13:00,380
I'm not sure if that's true or not.

1834
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:03,640
The manager could've...

1835
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,410
wanted Ga Yeon's necklace very badly.

1836
01:13:06,410 --> 01:13:07,650
There were a lot of pictures...

1837
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:10,950
of Ga Yeon. I'm not sure if he...

1838
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:14,840
was obsessed over her or the necklace. Anyway,

1839
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,340
I think he had a plan.

1840
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:18,240
He seemed to be in debt.

1841
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:21,410
The manager was tagged out yesterday.

1842
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:24,650
There were strands of hair on his name tag.

1843
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,180
(There were strands of hair on his name tag.)

1844
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:28,600
They were long. That means it was a woman.

1845
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:31,240
The cleaning lady was tagged out too.

1846
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,540
I checked her cell phone.

1847
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:36,510
She had talked to Ga Yeon over the phone.

1848
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:38,140
I think Ga Yeon...

1849
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:39,810
staged everything.

1850
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:41,880
(Ga Yeon is the criminal.)

1851
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:44,710
I think Ga Yeon was having a financial crisis.

1852
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:47,740
- The necklace was insured.
- Okay.

1853
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:50,740
I think she staged everything in order to...

1854
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:54,290
receive the insurance money.

1855
01:13:54,290 --> 01:13:58,650
Are you saying Ga Yeon also staged the invitation...

1856
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:01,940
- that was sent to Kwang Soo?
- Yes.

1857
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:05,340
- People find Kwang Soo suspicious.
- I see.

1858
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:07,910
I think Ga Yeon knew this and...

1859
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:11,150
- tried to frame him.
- She framed him.

1860
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:14,650
- I think Ga Yeon planted the...
- Hey!

1861
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:19,040
- master key in Kwang Soo's room.
- Where's the master key?

1862
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,010
I think Ga Yeon did all that...

1863
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:25,710
in order to frame Kwang Soo for the crimes.

1864
01:14:25,710 --> 01:14:27,450
- Okay.
- I believe...

1865
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:31,140
Kim Ga Yeon is the criminal who staged everything.

1866
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:33,840
(Jong Kook suspects Ga Yeon.)

1867
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,520
Actually,

1868
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,380
people easily suspect me every week.

1869
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:42,240
So I think it's one of the members...

1870
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:44,310
who used that...

1871
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:46,040
against me.

1872
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,240
(He suspects the members.)

1873
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,240
It has to be one of them.

1874
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,750
When we...

1875
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:54,280
went into the manager's room,

1876
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,730
I saw four CDs...

1877
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:58,340
on the bed.

1878
01:14:58,340 --> 01:14:59,440
(Four members released albums.)

1879
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,610
Haha's CD was missing.

1880
01:15:00,610 --> 01:15:01,950
(Haha's album wasn't there.)

1881
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:04,280
- Haha's CD wasn't there.
- Right.

1882
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,710
- And here's the crucial clue.
- Okay.

1883
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:07,840
(It's the crucial clue.)

1884
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:08,980
I will show you.

1885
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:10,180
(To Kwang Soo)

1886
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:11,240
It's this stamp.

1887
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,280
(Mapo-gu)

1888
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,910
It says "Mapo-gu".

1889
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:18,340
Out of the members, the only person who lives in mapo-gu...

1890
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:19,710
is Haha.

1891
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:23,070
(Kwang Soo suspects Haha.)

1892
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:26,340
Let's start from the beginning.

1893
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:27,980
What's your name?

1894
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:30,430
My name is Kang Hee Geon.

1895
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:32,240
- What?
- It's Gary.

1896
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,810
Okay, Gary.

1897
01:15:33,810 --> 01:15:35,440
(I thought I was really being interrogated.)

1898
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,540
I'm sorry.

1899
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:39,830
I thought I had to tell you my real name.

1900
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:43,110
Who do you think is the...

1901
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:44,950
real criminal?

1902
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:46,540
I think it's...

1903
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,450
Ga Yeon's siblings. They...

1904
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:53,110
- are after the insurance money.
- Insurance money?

1905
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:55,040
Why do you think that?

1906
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,540
There was a car...

1907
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:59,010
parked in front of Ga Yeon's room. It seemed like her car.

1908
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:00,240
There was a picture.

1909
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:02,010
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1910
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:05,540
Who else do you think is the criminal?

1911
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:08,340
(Who else is the criminal?)

1912
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:14,310
Stop pondering and just spit it out.

1913
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:16,240
(What does Gary think?)

1914
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,240
- It's been confusing.
- Okay.

1915
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,920
- I suspected Kwang Soo at first.
- I see.

1916
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,240
- Okay.
- I think...

1917
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:24,340
(The criminal is...)

1918
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:25,440
I think it's Haha.

1919
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,340
(It's Haha.)

1920
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:28,740
Why do you think so?

1921
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:31,810
I saw the guestbook.

1922
01:16:31,810 --> 01:16:32,910
(He looked at the guard's guestbook.)

1923
01:16:32,910 --> 01:16:36,010
- One of the visitors...
- Yes.

1924
01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:37,670
on the 25th...

1925
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:40,080
wrote "sibling" instead of a name.

1926
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,610
It must be someone...

1927
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:44,780
who is close enough to Ga Yeon...

1928
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:47,640
that he or she can just write "sibling" instead of a name.

1929
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,320
Also...

1930
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,680
- the dying message...
- Yes.

1931
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:53,280
- I think...
- Yes.

1932
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,440
it means...

1933
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:55,540
(Did Jae Seok solve the mystery sign?)

1934
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:56,840
"Little Brat".

1935
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,040
(Does the dying message read "Little Brat"?)

1936
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,530
Little brat.

1937
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:02,930
- Little brat?
- Yes.

1938
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:05,340
Little brat is Haha's nickname.

1939
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:06,810
- I see.
- So it must be Haha.

1940
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:08,380
(That's why it's Haha.)

1941
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:13,610
(Who is the real criminal?)

1942
01:17:13,610 --> 01:17:15,330
After investigating...

1943
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:18,450
the crime scenes and listening to your testimonies,

1944
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:21,810
I was able to find the real criminal.

1945
01:17:21,810 --> 01:17:23,980
- Really?
- Did you figure it out?

1946
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:25,080
It must be one of us.

1947
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,470
- Did you catch the person?
- Yes, we caught him.

1948
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:29,680
- That's great.
- Did you find the necklace too?

1949
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,080
- Yes, we found it.
- Really?

1950
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,640
- The suspect is...
- Who is it?

1951
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:40,380
(Is it Seok Jin who was anxious all day long?)

1952
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:43,480
(Is it Kwang Soo who got suspected?)

1953
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:47,080
(Is it Jae Seok who was alone the whole time?)

1954
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:49,980
(Is it Ga Yeon, the mysterious owner of the mountain cabin?)

1955
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:52,680
(Or is it Haha who was unusually active in the search?)

1956
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:57,610
(Who is the culprit?)

1957
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:17,540
- The suspect is...
- Who is it?

1958
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:23,280
(Is it Seok Jin who was anxious all day long?)

1959
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,380
(Is it Kwang Soo who got suspected?)

1960
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:29,980
(Is it Jae Seok who was alone the whole time?)

1961
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:32,880
(Is it Ga Yeon, the mysterious owner of the mountain cabin?)

1962
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:35,580
(Or is it Haha who was unusually active in the search?)

1963
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:40,510
(Who is the culprit?)

1964
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:43,930
Kim Ga Yeon and Haha.

1965
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:45,460
- Really?
- I guessed it right!

1966
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:48,630
(Oh my gosh)

1967
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:51,030
Kim Ga Yeon and Haha.

1968
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:52,730
- Really?
- I guessed it right!

1969
01:18:52,730 --> 01:18:55,010
- I guessed it right!
- Really?

1970
01:18:55,010 --> 01:18:58,330
(Ga Yeon and Haha were behind everything.)

1971
01:18:58,330 --> 01:19:00,090
- It's not me!
- I knew it!

1972
01:19:00,090 --> 01:19:01,460
I knew it!

1973
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:02,730
- Really?
- I knew it!

1974
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:04,290
They were the culprits!

1975
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:06,130
- What?
- It wasn't me.

1976
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:09,110
- I was innocent.
- There were two people...

1977
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:11,290
who figured out the criminals.

1978
01:19:11,290 --> 01:19:13,360
It's Jae Seok and Gary.

1979
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,690
(Jae Seok and Gary guessed it right.)

1980
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:16,630
- Yes!
- How did you find out?

1981
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:19,730
Who do you think...

1982
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:23,590
is the suspect of this incident?

1983
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:25,930
(Gary suggested that Kim Ga Yeon had an accomplice.)

1984
01:19:25,930 --> 01:19:27,330
I think it's Haha.

1985
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:28,560
(He picked Haha as the other suspect.)

1986
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:31,730
I think Haha and...

1987
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:33,530
Ga Yeon are siblings.

1988
01:19:33,530 --> 01:19:35,030
(He suspects Haha and Ga Yeon to be siblings.)

1989
01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:37,020
What's the reason for that?

1990
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:38,530
I saw...

1991
01:19:38,530 --> 01:19:40,630
(How are they siblings when they have different last names?)

1992
01:19:40,630 --> 01:19:43,010
I saw Haha's wallet in his bag.

1993
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:44,290
And there was...

1994
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:46,630
Haha's family picture.

1995
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:51,500
It was Haha and his older sister.

1996
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:55,620
In front of Ga Yeon's room, there was a car parked.

1997
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:57,930
And she had the same picture.

1998
01:19:57,930 --> 01:20:00,030
- You found the picture in the car.
- Yes.

1999
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:01,730
So my guess is that...

2000
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:03,630
they were separated when they were young.

2001
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:04,930
(He suspects that they are siblings separated in the past.)

2002
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:08,530
This incident was done by Haha and Kim Ga Yeon.

2003
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:09,930
(Gary's conclusion is that Haha and Ga Yeon did it together.)

2004
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,130
They did it to get the insurance money.

2005
01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:12,960
- The insurance money?
- Yes.

2006
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:14,830
- Little brat.
- Yes.

2007
01:20:14,830 --> 01:20:16,030
It has to be Haha.

2008
01:20:16,030 --> 01:20:17,290
Also, I...

2009
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:19,090
(Jae Seok pointed Haha as the suspect.)

2010
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:20,560
I found a crucial evidence.

2011
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:21,630
- Another one?
- Yes.

2012
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:22,890
You will know what it is when you see it.

2013
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:25,330
This is the guard's cell phone.

2014
01:20:25,330 --> 01:20:27,030
The suspects are...

2015
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:31,290
Kim Ga Yeon and Haha.

2016
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:32,830
- They are accomplices.
- Yes.

2017
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:34,630
Everything is here.

2018
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:36,690
This was found on the guard's cell phone.

2019
01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:38,930
(There is a written oath in the guard's cell phone.)

2020
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:40,630
That's Kim Ga Yeon.

2021
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:43,930
(Little brother)

2022
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:45,860
See that?

2023
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:49,220
Yes. Therefore,

2024
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:51,130
the guard was pressed because of the debts and...

2025
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:55,700
he accidentally found out about Haha and Ga Yeon's plan.

2026
01:20:56,230 --> 01:20:58,630
So he took a picture of them planning the crime...

2027
01:20:58,630 --> 01:21:01,130
and using that picture,

2028
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:03,610
he continued to threaten them, especially the owner.

2029
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:08,620
That's why she conspired with Haha and...

2030
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:12,490
got rid of the guard.

2031
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:13,930
(Afraid that their plan will be revealed, they removed the guard.)

2032
01:21:13,930 --> 01:21:16,130
(What is the truth?)

2033
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:25,460
Yes, this is what happened.

2034
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:27,790
(This is the whole story of the incident.)

2035
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:29,630
Oh gosh.

2036
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:31,430
It's been a while, Sister.

2037
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:33,330
Yes, it's been a while.

2038
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:38,630
(They are siblings from different mothers.)

2039
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:41,490
Several days ago, I was cleaning Father's room and...

2040
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:44,250
Haha and Kim Ga Yeon are siblings from different mothers.

2041
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:49,350
And they discover that their father is about to donate all his wealth.

2042
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:50,730
Does it make sense?

2043
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:52,230
How could he do that?

2044
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:53,930
- How can he?
- Come on.

2045
01:21:53,930 --> 01:21:55,230
Ga Yeon decides to...

2046
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:58,980
steal the Tears of the Sun necklace, which is worth 20 million dollars.

2047
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:02,190
On top of that, she also plots a self-fabricated incident...

2048
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:05,460
with Haha to earn 10-million-dollar insurance money.

2049
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:07,130
You know how much this is worth, right?

2050
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:10,560
- 10 million dollars!
- 10 million dollars.

2051
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,930
(10 million dollars)

2052
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:13,990
The Tears of the Sun is mine forever.

2053
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,230
10 million dollars!

2054
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:19,530
They chose to put the blame on Kwang Soo,

2055
01:22:19,530 --> 01:22:23,430
and they sent a fake invitation to bring in the Running Man members.

2056
01:22:23,930 --> 01:22:25,700
You know.

2057
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:29,070
Invitation to the mountain cabin. Congratulations.

2058
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:32,030
You have won free lodging at the mountain cabin.

2059
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:36,630
I get to stay at the mountain cabin for free.

2060
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:38,230
However,

2061
01:22:38,230 --> 01:22:41,930
the security guard of the cabin accidentally found out the scheme.

2062
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:45,190
(The guard accidentally finds out about their scheme.)

2063
01:22:45,190 --> 01:22:48,330
And the guard, who was pressed to pay his debts,

2064
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:50,730
asked them for five million dollars for keeping their secrets.

2065
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:52,090
- What's wrong?
- What are you doing here?

2066
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:55,030
I'm not smart, but I think you're scheming an insurance scam.

2067
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:57,830
(No way!)

2068
01:22:57,830 --> 01:22:59,230
Stamp it. Hurry up.

2069
01:22:59,230 --> 01:23:00,330
Stamp it right now.

2070
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:01,460
Let's get this over with.

2071
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:03,930
(They write a promise note that they will pay him five million dollars.)

2072
01:23:03,930 --> 01:23:06,130
- I will go now then.
- Okay.

2073
01:23:08,130 --> 01:23:09,960
This is so upsetting.

2074
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,330
We've lost five million dollars.

2075
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:12,830
(I am upset.)

2076
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:16,490
However, the siblings didn't want to give him the money.

2077
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:17,830
Why am I so anxious?

2078
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:21,660
On the day before D-day, which is on the 25th,

2079
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:23,490
they went to the guard.

2080
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:24,930
(On the 25th, they went to meet the guard.)

2081
01:23:24,930 --> 01:23:26,830
- Come in.
- Open up.

2082
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:28,990
- It's us.
- We're here.

2083
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:31,030
- What are you doing here?
- Hello.

2084
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:32,490
A while ago...

2085
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:33,730
- We have something to tell you.
- Come in.

2086
01:23:33,730 --> 01:23:35,230
- Okay.
- Come on in.

2087
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:38,730
They brutally murdered the guard.

2088
01:23:38,730 --> 01:23:40,090
What's up?

2089
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:42,510
What are you doing?

2090
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:45,230
(We can't give you the money!)

2091
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:53,130
(One day before D-day, the guard got eliminated.)

2092
01:23:53,130 --> 01:23:54,860
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2093
01:23:56,260 --> 01:23:58,530
(The guard's room)

2094
01:23:59,030 --> 01:24:03,360
(The guard leaves his last message.)

2095
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,330
The guard's last message was a smiley face.

2096
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:08,090
It meant Haha.

2097
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:09,830
(With a smiley face, he pointed Haha.)

2098
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:11,430
The guard is eliminated.

2099
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:14,090
Ga Yeon took the guard's master key...

2100
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:16,690
and put it in Kwang Soo's room.

2101
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:17,830
- She did it!
- See?

2102
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:20,030
- And then she placed him there.
- I told you it wasn't me!

2103
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:23,690
The housekeeper accidentally found the hidden necklace.

2104
01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:25,490
And Ga Yeon eliminated her.

2105
01:24:25,490 --> 01:24:27,030
- So the housekeeper found it.
- No!

2106
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:28,530
Darn it!

2107
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:33,610
(She brutally eliminated the housekeeper.)

2108
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:37,830
(Last night, she went inside Kwang Soo's room.)

2109
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:42,860
(She naturally placed the master key in his room.)

2110
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:49,660
(And Haha who came to get the vegetables this afternoon...)

2111
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:54,460
(stole the Tears of the Sun necklace as planned.)

2112
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:58,860
(And he hid it in the corner of the laundry room.)

2113
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:02,590
(It's done!)

2114
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:05,570
They prepared everything,

2115
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:07,230
but unexpected events happened.

2116
01:25:07,230 --> 01:25:10,830
The housekeeper accidentally found the necklace.

2117
01:25:10,830 --> 01:25:12,830
(The housekeeper accidentally found the necklace this evening.)

2118
01:25:12,830 --> 01:25:14,730
And Kim Ga Yeon who figured this out...

2119
01:25:14,730 --> 01:25:17,130
eliminated the housekeeper in the laundry room.

2120
01:25:17,130 --> 01:25:18,690
(The housekeeper contacts Ga Yeon to return the necklace.)

2121
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:19,930
Hello.

2122
01:25:19,930 --> 01:25:21,430
Hello, Madam.

2123
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:22,660
You are here.

2124
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,130
Where did you find that?

2125
01:25:24,130 --> 01:25:25,830
I saw it...

2126
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:27,930
inside a cup.

2127
01:25:27,930 --> 01:25:29,990
There is...

2128
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:32,430
Oh gosh! What are you doing?

2129
01:25:32,430 --> 01:25:33,730
Oh no!

2130
01:25:33,730 --> 01:25:34,730
Gosh.

2131
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:37,830
(Because of Haha, she unexpectedly eliminated the housekeeper.)

2132
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:39,330
My back hurts.

2133
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:41,130
My hair is a mess.

2134
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:48,630
(She left traces of evidence at the site.)

2135
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:51,930
Ga Yeon's hairpin and hair were found...

2136
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:53,230
on the spot.

2137
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:55,590
(Guard)

2138
01:25:56,830 --> 01:26:00,260
Haha who visited the day before also left traces of evidence.

2139
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:03,830
Family pictures were found in Ga Yeon's car and Haha's wallet.

2140
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:07,620
Also, Haha's book was upside-down alone.

2141
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:11,620
Haha was the only one with no album.

2142
01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:14,230
All these traces of evidence...

2143
01:26:14,230 --> 01:26:15,430
pointed to...

2144
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:17,730
- Haha and Ga Yeon.
- Show us the evidence.

2145
01:26:17,730 --> 01:26:19,030
(It pointed to Haha and Ga Yeon.)

2146
01:26:19,030 --> 01:26:20,630
- All right.
- I was innocent.

2147
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:22,520
Only two people figured out that...

2148
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:24,730
- there were two suspects.
- There's one more person?

2149
01:26:24,730 --> 01:26:26,930
- However,
- He was precise.

2150
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:29,960
the person who guessed more precisely is...

2151
01:26:30,430 --> 01:26:32,190
- Gary.
- I got it!

2152
01:26:32,190 --> 01:26:34,430
I guessed that they were siblings from different mothers!

2153
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:39,430
I think they are siblings separated when they were young.

2154
01:26:40,030 --> 01:26:42,230
I think they are siblings from different mothers.

2155
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:43,730
(Gary guessed precisely that they would be siblings.)

2156
01:26:43,730 --> 01:26:46,000
Haha and Ga Yeon...

2157
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,130
- plotted together.
- They are accomplices.

2158
01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:50,230
I think they were involved...

2159
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:52,330
in a romantic relationship.

2160
01:26:52,330 --> 01:26:53,930
(He guessed they were involved in a romantic relationship.)

2161
01:26:53,930 --> 01:26:56,630
I couldn't possibly say it on TV.

2162
01:26:56,630 --> 01:26:58,890
Something like that.

2163
01:26:59,390 --> 01:27:00,630
I thought...

2164
01:27:00,630 --> 01:27:02,400
you were a person with innocent thoughts.

2165
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,830
What does that have to do...

2166
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:05,830
with being innocent? I'm trying to solve a case.

2167
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:07,400
(He guessed they were involved in an inappropriate relationship.)

2168
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,330
- I won't forgive you.
- That thought never occurred to me.

2169
01:27:09,330 --> 01:27:10,730
He told me.

2170
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:13,530
- How did you know?
- He said he wrote a novel.

2171
01:27:13,530 --> 01:27:14,690
What did he say?

2172
01:27:14,690 --> 01:27:17,030
- How could you guess that right?
- He's amazing.

2173
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:19,330
Watching a lot of TV series really helped.

2174
01:27:19,330 --> 01:27:21,430
- The messed-up TV series helped.
- They helped.

2175
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:23,430
I am a big fan of "My Daughter, Geum Sa Wol".

2176
01:27:23,430 --> 01:27:25,710
Hey.

2177
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:28,360
Do you think you can get married in May?

2178
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,840
- You'll be in jail.
- You'll have to eat jail food.

2179
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,130
You'll be in jail for quite a while.

2180
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:33,260
Go away.

2181
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:34,460
See you next week.

2182
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:35,560
Go to jail.

2183
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:37,260
No!

2184
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:39,460
- It serves you right!
- No!

2185
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:40,730
You're not getting the insurance money.

2186
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:42,360
They deserve to rot.

2187
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:44,150
My goodness.

2188
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:45,960
- Goodbye!
- Be a better person!

2189
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,760
Bye!

2190
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,130
- Save me.
- Don't blame others!

2191
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:52,660
I've never been in a police car.

2192
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:55,090
(The mountain cabin case is finally settled.)

2193
01:27:55,090 --> 01:27:56,360
Gary wins a prize.

2194
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:58,060
- Really?
- What is that?

2195
01:27:58,060 --> 01:27:59,690
What is it?

2196
01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:01,160
- Is it a travel voucher?
- Do you remember the last prize?

2197
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:02,660
It was a travel voucher.

2198
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:04,260
- Again?
- Where's the destination?

2199
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:05,760
- "Sherlock Tour"?
- What's that?

2200
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,190
- What is it?
- Are you going to the UK too?

2201
01:28:07,190 --> 01:28:09,400
- He's going to the UK.
- You'll go with Haha.

2202
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:10,660
(Haha won a trip to London last week.)

2203
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:12,460
It serves him right.

2204
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:14,930
Good for him.

2205
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:17,450
Why do I have to go with him?

2206
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:19,990
The squid and the octopus are going to the UK together.

2207
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:23,260
- Wow.
- Why does it have to be him?

2208
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:25,460
- This is great.
- That was fun.

2209
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:26,760
Thank you, everyone.

2210
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:27,860
Thank you.

2211
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:30,420
Should I be happy or not?

2212
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:32,260
Look forward to Sherlock Yu's next adventure.

2213
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:33,660
What did you say?

2214
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:35,930
- You didn't do anything.
- How did you know?

2215
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:37,590
(The End)

2216
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:39,660
Senior interns?

2217
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:41,930
I'm a new intern. My name is Kim Do Kyun.

2218
01:28:41,930 --> 01:28:43,860
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

2219
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:45,360
It's Yoo Yeol.

2220
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,030
- Hello.
- Hello.

2221
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:48,360
- Hello.
- Wait.

2222
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,990
- Wait.
- I'll drive for you.

2223
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:51,530
- I'll drive.
- You don't have to.

2224
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:53,460
- No way.
- Just get in.

2225
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:55,030
- Would you like some coffee?
- Coffee?

2226
01:28:55,030 --> 01:28:58,330
- No, stay seated.
- I'll do it!

2227
01:28:58,330 --> 01:28:59,560
Why are you so bad?

2228
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:01,090
Give us another chance.

2229
01:29:01,090 --> 01:29:02,160
(Age is just a number.)

2230
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:03,390
(Competition for a team dinner)

2231
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:04,930
- Let's see.
- No!

2232
01:29:04,930 --> 01:29:06,460
(Who will win?)

2233
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:08,230
(Next week, "Senior Interns")
