1
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,750
(The Running Man members have all arrived.)

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,450
Good morning.

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,820
Govod morning, all.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,790
Hello, good morning.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,890
What are we going to do today?

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,590
What is this?

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,490
(What is today's mission?)

8
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,650
Today we will have a Running Man Intern Race.

9
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,850
Fuor the members that have been running hard,

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,590
interns with a 12 year age gap will be picking you up.

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,960
So we ask all members to wait at your assigned location.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,620
Interns with a 12 year age gap?

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,960
If it's a 12 year age gap...

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,050
and I was born in 1979,

15
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,220
my intern was born in 1991?

16
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,050
A person born in 1991.

17
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,550
I found celebrities born in 1991.

18
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,150
There's Kim Go Eun...

19
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,850
and Park So Dam.

20
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,250
My goodness.

21
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,990
There's Park Bo Gum. Maybe he's my intern.

22
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,250
It's nice to meet you, Park Bo Gum.

23
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,250
(Grinning)

24
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,320
If the intern is only 20 years old,

25
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,150
he or she may not be a skilled driver.

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,750
Who could it be?

27
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,250
(There is a great deal of teaching to do.)

28
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,040
So my intern will pick me up?

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,650
If it's an internship,

30
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,350
I should teach them a few things.

31
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,850
(I should teach them a few things.)

32
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,690
(What are the interns doing?)

33
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,250
It's very nerve-racking.

34
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,450
I'm so nervous.

35
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,250
(He is full of excitement on his first day of work.)

36
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,650
I'm nervous.

37
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,150
I don't know if I'll do well.

38
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,320
I'm not sure what's going on yet.

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,150
(Please wait a little, we'll be there soon.)

40
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,550
My intern is here.

41
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,950
(Who will be Haha's intern that was born in 1991?)

42
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,550
(Will it be the person he has been imagining?)

43
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,250
(Park So Dam or Kim Go Eun?)

44
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,740
So Dam.

45
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,630
So Dam, I'll be waiting for you.

46
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:56,520
(Welcome, my intern.)

47
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,650
Oh, it's you.

48
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,550
(Oh, it's you.)

49
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,750
Hey.

50
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,640
Haha,

51
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,950
it's nice to meet you.

52
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,550
(Stumbling)

53
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,050
Haha,

54
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,520
I'll serve you well today.

55
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,950
(It's Korea's number one female show host, Park Mi Sun, born in 1967.)

56
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,250
- Sir, Haha.
 - Wait a minute.

57
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,130
Wait.

58
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,950
You meant 12 years older than me?

59
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,250
(You meant 12 years older than me?)

60
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,250
- Bye, bye.
 - Not younger but older?

61
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,950
Haha, we should get going now.

62
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,220
(Haha is uncomfortable with Mi Sun's formal behaviour.)

63
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,520
I'm sorry.

64
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,560
This is really uncomfortable.

65
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,850
Yes, okay.

66
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,750
- This way, Haha.
 - Let me drive.

67
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,850
- I'll do it.
 - Get in, Haha.

68
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,220
Please get in.

69
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,450
Oh, my.

70
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,730
(Interns should escort the senior members into the car.)

71
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,150
(Speed is a necessity for interns.)

72
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,950
My goodness.

73
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,530
What happened, Mi Sun?

74
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,150
I'm your...

75
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,220
intern today, Haha.

76
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,520
What's gotten into you?

77
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,350
What should I call you, Haha?

78
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,150
How long has it been since your debut?

79
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,750
It's been 29 years.

80
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,320
(She is a veteran intern.)

81
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,550
- Should I call you Sir Haha?
 - Hold on.

82
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,420
Would you like to call me Miss Park?

83
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,520
Miss Park?

84
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,850
(This is very uncomfortable.)

85
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,050
Is that too much?

86
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,520
- Please.
 - Yes, Haha.

87
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,050
It's okay when it's just the two of us,

88
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,850
I understand what today's concept is.

89
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,850
- No, it's all right.
 - So when it's just the two of us,

90
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,620
- No, that wouldn't do.
 - please just be yourself.

91
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,050
- I know that you have a temper.
 - Don't be like that.

92
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,420
Stop it right there.

93
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,750
What are you talking about?

94
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,220
(She is an intern with two faces.)

95
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,120
Please let me do my work.

96
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,850
(Intern Park Mi Sun wants to be called Miss Park and has a temper.)

97
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,350
Please call me Miss Park.

98
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,840
I'd like to be called Miss Park.

99
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,550
I see a car coming this way.

100
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,750
There's a camera inside. I think that's it.

101
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,340
Could that be the one?

102
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,950
(What a surprise)

103
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,220
It's Hong Ryul.

104
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,650
Hong Ryul.

105
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,850
It's Hong Ryul.

106
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,450
(Who will be Seok Jin's intern for today?)

107
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,120
It's Hong Ryul.

108
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,450
Hello, Hong Ryul.

109
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,150
Hong Ryul, it's nice to see you.

110
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,320
Hello.

111
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,950
- It's nice to see you.
 - Hello.

112
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,150
- Are you...
 - Yes.

113
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,350
the intern?

114
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,750
Yes, I will be working as your intern today.

115
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,150
So you will assist me today?

116
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,420
Yes, you're right.

117
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,350
- I'll drive.
 - No, it's okay.

118
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,450
Please let me drive.

119
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,860
- The driver's seat...
 - This is uncomfortable.

120
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,690
fits me perfectly.

121
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,750
I'm uncomfortable.

122
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,950
Please get in.

123
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,150
- Have a seat in the back.
 - No, that's all right.

124
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,620
- Sit in the back seat.
 - No, that's too uncomfortable.

125
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,550
- The back seat is all warmed up.
 - No, it's okay.

126
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,950
- That will be too uncomfortable.
 - I warmed it up.

127
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,360
- I don't know what is happening.
 - What am I doing right now?

128
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,690
(Absolute discomfort)

129
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,750
Okay.

130
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,250
Please don't do a thing.

131
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,550
- I'm trying to have a fresh start.
 - To be frank,

132
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,390
- Don't worry.
 - please don't be surprised,

133
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,480
but I actually searched for people who...

134
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,590
are 12 and more years younger than me.

135
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,450
Did you really?

136
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,150
Seok Jin, you're now...

137
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,150
one of the seniors too.

138
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,120
I don't think that way though.

139
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,620
Once I begin to think about age, I can't interact with young people.

140
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,720
So I try to forget about my age.

141
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,550
- I tried to do that too.
 - I've been thinking like that.

142
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,550
But that only works for a while.

143
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,150
That's what I'm concerned about too. I'm not...

144
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,720
- sure how long I can keep this up.
 - You're right.

145
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,320
When you reach a certain point,

146
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,950
making an effort is useless.

147
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,550
- Yes, you're right.
 - It happens.

148
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,860
- Yes.
 - My goodness.

149
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,950
I forgot my duty.

150
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,860
- I wasn't scolding you.
 - No, it's fine.

151
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,050
- I didn't mean to say that.
 - No, it's okay.

152
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,420
- This is more comfortable for me.
 - No, it's all right.

153
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,250
I've been reminded repeatedly,

154
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,650
but I forgot for a moment.

155
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,860
- I apologise.
 - It's all right.

156
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,750
I understood you completely.

157
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,350
- No, I'm sorry.
 - It was right of you to say that.

158
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,750
No, it wasn't.

159
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,350
We both have something in common.

160
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,850
We both have nicknames related to our nose.

161
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,350
Yes, I heard.

162
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,950
Right, because my nose is big.

163
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,850
Goodness, I forgot again.

164
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,950
No, it's all right.

165
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,350
I don't know what's gotten into me.

166
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,250
I keep speaking comfortably with you.

167
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,950
What should I do?

168
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,690
- I forgot about all these cameras.
 - That's all right.

169
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,050
Please just be yourself.

170
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,850
I thought we were having a private conversation.

171
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,350
- Oh, it's fine.
 - I forgot my duty.

172
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,270
(Intern Lee Hong Ryul is the oldest intern and often speaks freely.)

173
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,950
I see my intern coming.

174
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,450
Why turn on the emergency lights?

175
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,150
Wait, who is it?

176
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,250
(Who is it?)

177
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,350
Hello.

178
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,850
(Who will be Jae Seok's intern for today?)

179
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,550
Please don't get out.

180
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,050
It's Yoo Yeol.

181
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,520
(Yoo Yeol, who led the K-POP industry through the 80s and 90s.)

182
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,750
Yoo Yeol.

183
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,250
Oh my.

184
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,850
It's nice to meet you.

185
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,250
- Oh goodness.
 - Yes, well.

186
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,490
I will assist you today as your intern.

187
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,850
- My name is Yoo Yeol.
 - What is this?

188
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,390
Yoo Yeol.

189
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,540
What do you mean, you're my intern?

190
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,050
I've come here today...

191
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,950
- Yes?
 - to learn from the best.

192
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,490
- What?
 - I'll assist you today.

193
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,850
- Please, get in.
 - No, wait.

194
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,450
- That's not it.
 - Yes?

195
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,520
- I should drive.
 - No, it's all right.

196
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,220
- Today, I will drive.
 - I should be driving.

197
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,750
- That's not it.
 - No.

198
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,350
- I'll drive safely.
 - This is very uncomfortable.

199
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,550
My goodness.

200
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,720
You're making me uncomfortable.

201
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,050
I'm a good driver.

202
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,320
I see.

203
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,320
I should be driving, though.

204
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,250
No, let me serve you today.

205
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,750
Are we doing this right?

206
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,420
- I should be sitting next to you.
 - No, it's fine.

207
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,400
There's no camera in the back seat.

208
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,850
- Is that so?
 - Yes.

209
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,720
- Then I'll have you sit next to me.
 - Okay.

210
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,450
- I'll sit next to you.
 - Sure.

211
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,720
- Please stay there.
 - Let me help you change seats.

212
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,850
- I'll sit next to you.
 - Okay.

213
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,620
Please go unlock the door.

214
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,050
- I'm not used to this yet.
 - I understand.

215
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,820
- There you go.
 - You can go back to your seat.

216
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,150
Just get in.

217
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,520
(After a slight mix-up, the two set out again.)

218
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,850
- Shouldn't I be driving?
 - No.

219
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,920
No, it's all right. I'm an intern today.

220
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,650
That's my role.

221
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,750
And this is my first time on a variety show.

222
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,850
- I see.
 - I am an intern today.

223
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,750
Since you're an intern, I'll let you know that...

224
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,320
your voice doesn't really suit variety shows.

225
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,520
(Yeol's voice is too romantic for a variety show.)

226
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,530
It's too soft and sweet.

227
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,640
It's not fit for variety shows.

228
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,420
My goodness.

229
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,620
(Intern Yoo Yeol is advised to improve his voice for the show.)

230
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,620
(Running Man Headquarters, 9am)

231
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,750
What is this? It's driving me crazy.

232
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,220
This is so sudden. I don't know what to do with myself.

233
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,690
- Haha.
 - I was expecting...

234
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,730
- Park So Dam or Kim Go Eun.
 - Haha.

235
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,420
- Haha, please sit here.
 - Mi Sun's 50 years old.

236
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,750
Please don't mention my age.

237
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,960
It's been 29 years since she debuted.

238
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,420
And she tells me to call her Miss Park.

239
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,720
- Please call me Miss Park.
 - This is absurd.

240
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,820
(Haha can't stop complaining.)

241
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,750
- Haha.
 - She's like a grandmother to me.

242
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,890
She's an ancestor.

243
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,120
She's a fossil.

244
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,250
(She's as old as a fossil.)

245
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,210
- If she's my intern,
 - Haha.

246
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,820
what about Seok Jin?

247
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,420
Is his intern Song Hae?

248
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,100
(Is his intern Song Hae?)

249
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,520
- Come this way.
 - This is so uncomfortable.

250
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,960
(Hong Ryul is here instead of Song Hae.)

251
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,320
Have a seat.

252
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,760
They're coming. Seok Jin is here.

253
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,760
What is this? Oh, my.

254
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,250
- Hello.
 - Hong Ryul.

255
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,420
- How have you been?
 - Hong Ryul is here.

256
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,720
- Oh, my.
 - It's Hong Ryul.

257
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,750
(Bowing)

258
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,850
I should do that too.

259
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,720
Stop it, don't do that.

260
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,250
- What are you doing?
 - Don't do this.

261
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,320
Why is it so uncomfortable today?

262
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,520
- This is so uncomfortable.
 - Stop it.

263
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,220
Hong Ryul.

264
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,050
- Come this way.
 - Okay.

265
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,720
(Seok Jin guides his intern, Hong Ryul.)

266
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,750
- Thank you.
 - Here.

267
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,250
- Have a seat.
 - I should be doing this for you.

268
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,850
- No, it's fine.
 - Sit here.

269
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,050
Don't do this. You're making me uncomfortable.

270
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,960
- Hong Ryul.
 - Have a seat.

271
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,690
- Please, have a seat.
 - We're comfortable standing.

272
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,320
- Don't be like that.
 - Please don't do that.

273
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,420
- We're doing as we were told.
 - No, please.

274
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,420
- Please sit down.
 - We have to be standing.

275
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,650
We're supposed to be standing.

276
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,420
This is ridiculous.

277
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,520
(This is ridiculous.)

278
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,620
What am I supposed to do?

279
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,820
Oh!

280
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,150
(Who is it?)

281
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,550
He has a beard.

282
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,400
Who is it?

283
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,820
Is it Raymon Kim? It's a man?

284
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,120
(It's not a 20-year-old intern?)

285
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,620
Wait.

286
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,320
(Who will be Kwang Soo's intern?)

287
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,620
Hello.

288
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,620
(Who will be Kwang Soo's intern?)

289
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,720
- Hello, it's nice to meet you.
 - Hello.

290
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,320
Oh, I see.

291
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,960
Hello. I should have opened the door for you.

292
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,520
- No.
 - I'm sorry.

293
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,250
- Don't do that.
 - Let me open the door for you.

294
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,120
Stay in your seat. I'm really okay.

295
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,250
- It's okay.
 - Hello.

296
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,520
- Nice to meet you.
 - Yes, hello.

297
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,150
I'm the new intern, Kim Jo Han.

298
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,320
What are you talking about?

299
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,520
It's all right.

300
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,250
I came to escort you.

301
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,820
- You don't have to.
 - Don't worry.

302
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,320
(Uncomfortable)

303
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,420
- Please, get in.
 - I'll drive.

304
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,220
- No.
 - This is so uncomfortable!

305
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,150
- Don't be like that.
 - What?

306
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,050
I'm a great driver.

307
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,850
- I can drive the car.
 - Don't feel uncomfortable.

308
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,150
Okay.

309
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,750
I should have introduced myself more properly.

310
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,720
That's absurd.

311
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,220
- Don't say that.
 - I'm sorry.

312
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,950
This is crazy.

313
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,150
(This is crazy.)

314
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,920
- Should we go?
 - Yes, sure.

315
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,520
I'm not sure what exactly we'll be doing today,

316
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,420
but given the situation...

317
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,420
- Yes.
 - Can I speak casually to you?

318
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,690
Yes, of course. Please treat me comfortably.

319
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,630
- Given the situation.
 - Sure, Kwang Soo.

320
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,220
Then I'll have to talk more casually.

321
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,720
- You can call me Intern Kim.
 - Okay.

322
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,820
Please drive safely.

323
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,150
I heard you got lost on the way here.

324
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,520
I heard you got lost on the way here.

325
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,150
The thing is...

326
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,320
(Kwang Soo starts to act like Jo Han's senior.)

327
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,420
The navigation system misguided me.

328
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,520
The people I hate the most are people who give excuses.

329
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,620
(I hate people who give excuses.)

330
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,250
Please drive within the speed limit.

331
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,750
You're right.

332
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,050
I won't make any excuses from now on.

333
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,510
I was freezing.

334
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,620
It was so cold that I think I'm getting a cold now.

335
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,950
- Should I find a pharmacy?
 - No,

336
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,730
- What about a hospital?
 - it's okay.

337
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,890
I can understand you...

338
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,650
because I'm a generous senior who can embrace others' mistakes.

339
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,120
Thank you.

340
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,850
This will never happen again.

341
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,250
I promise you.

342
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,550
(Laughing)

343
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,630
I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing.

344
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,950
No, you were right. I was late.

345
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,820
(Innocent intern Kim Jo Han is quick to apologise.)

346
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,050
Oh, my.

347
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,720
(Ji Hyo is surprised.)

348
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,530
Is he my intern?

349
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,220
He's my intern?

350
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,920
Is he 12 years older than me?

351
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,520
Hello. Nice to meet you.

352
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,220
- You're here.
 - Yes.

353
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,620
- I have the car ready.
 - Okay.

354
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,950
(Intern Kim Won Hae)

355
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,050
(Won Hae debuted in 1991.)

356
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,250
Didn't I warn you all?

357
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,650
You!

358
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,690
I'm your supervisor!

359
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,820
(Won Hae, born in 1969, is a versatile actor.)

360
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,690
Thank you.

361
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,150
Thank you very much.

362
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,850
Thank you.

363
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,350
I don't know what to do. Thank you.

364
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,820
Who's the senior here?

365
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,920
(Breathing deeply)

366
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,820
- Buckle up.
 - I already did.

367
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,120
(Rustling)

368
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,620
(Laughing)

369
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,150
Are you going to wear those gloves?

370
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,720
(He even prepared gloves.)

371
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,300
Are you...

372
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,720
- nervous?
 - Yes, very much.

373
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,050
(Let's take off.)

374
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,150
(The car is filled with an awkward atmosphere.)

375
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,320
Plate number 6432, please go faster.

376
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,050
My senior is running late.

377
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,850
- It's okay.
 - Plate number 6432!

378
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,650
- It's all right.
 - Why are you driving so slowly?

379
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,950
(No one can get in my senior's way.)

380
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,820
I'm really okay.

381
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,690
I'm okay. I really am.

382
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,420
Take your time crossing. You have some time left.

383
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,550
(There's still some time.)

384
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:02,290
Take your time, you still have a few seconds left.

385
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,820
All right.

386
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,020
You're very attentive to your surroundings.

387
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:13,620
(Intern Kim Won Hae is a nosy and determined driver.)

388
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,320
(Who will be Gary's intern?)

389
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,020
Oh, goodness.

390
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,550
It's Kil Kang.

391
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,520
What a surprise, hello.

392
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,110
- Hello, I'm Intern Ahn Kil Kang.
 - Yes, hello.

393
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,720
- I'm honoured.
 - It's my pleasure.

394
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,220
- Let me drive.
 - No.

395
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,420
- I should drive.
 - You can't.

396
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,540
- No really.
 - Please, get in.

397
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,750
Oh, my.

398
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,620
Wear your seatbelt. I'll drive carefully.

399
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,850
Goodness, Kil Kang.

400
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,050
(I'll escort you safely.)

401
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,540
What's going on?

402
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,220
- I should have come to you.
 - No, it's all right.

403
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,550
I'm Intern Kil Kang.

404
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,420
- Are you an intern?
 - Yes. It's nice to meet you.

405
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,920
(Nice to meet you, Gary.)

406
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,050
When we were...

407
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,250
shooting "Dachimawa Lee" together, you taught me how to act.

408
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,690
And you're my intern now? How did this happen?

409
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,520
It's because I like you so much.

410
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,520
- Goodness.
 - I'll do my best.

411
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,220
- Okay.
 - Please speak casually to me.

412
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,320
- Should I?
 - Yes.

413
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,850
- How could I do that?
 - Be comfortable.

414
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,320
You can be comfortable with me.

415
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,850
I'm not sure if I can do that.

416
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,220
Of course you can.

417
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,750
I brought some tangerines for you.

418
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,220
- Oh, my.
 - You just have to sit and wait.

419
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,620
Is it really okay for me to let you do this?

420
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,950
Yes, you just wait.

421
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,320
- Open your mouth.
 - Okay.

422
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,720
- This is delicious.
 - I'll have some too.

423
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,120
Tangerines taste best when someone else peels them for you.

424
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,150
Is that so? I love you, Gary.

425
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:39,520
(I love you, Gary.)

426
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,950
I love you.

427
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,250
I know.

428
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,420
Thank you.

429
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,640
(Intern Ahn Kil Kang has great people skills.)

430
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,690
- Can't you sit down?
 - Seriously.

431
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,850
- Please sit down.
 - Please.

432
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,050
It'll make me feel comfortable if you sit down.

433
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,850
We were strictly instructed...

434
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,950
that we shouldn't sit down.

435
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,550
Oh, Hong Ryul.

436
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,150
- Oh, my.
 - It's Yoo Yeol.

437
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,950
- Yoo Yeol.
 - It's Yoo Yeol.

438
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,120
- Yoo Yeol's here.
 - It's Yoo Yeol.

439
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,250
- What's going on today?
 - I've never seen him before.

440
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,640
This is too uncomfortable.

441
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,050
- What's happening?
 - What do we do?

442
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,420
- What is this?
 - What's going on?

443
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,120
- Why are you doing this to us?
 - What is this?

444
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,950
- Oh, my.
 - I can't believe this.

445
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,950
- I'm so uncomfortable.
 - This is crazy.

446
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,920
- Hello.
 - Nice to meet you.

447
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,200
- I don't know what to do.
 - I can't believe this.

448
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,150
- This is so uncomfortable.
 - It really is.

449
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,320
- It's nice to meet you.
 - Yes, hello.

450
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,320
- Hello.
 - Nice to meet you.

451
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,620
- What do I do?
 - Are you an intern?

452
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,990
- Oh, my.
 - This is so uncomfortable.

453
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,520
Please sit down.

454
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,840
- It's okay.
 - Please have a seat.

455
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,220
- We can't sit down.
 - I see.

456
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,690
Sit down first.

457
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,750
- Have a seat.
 - We'll sit if there are seats left.

458
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,320
- Why are you doing this?
 - Let me be.

459
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,320
- I'll sit if there's an empty seat.
 - You're not usually like this.

460
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,220
- No, I'm okay.
 - Please sit down.

461
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,020
- Please have a seat.
 - I'm okay.

462
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,050
- Have a seat, Won Hae.
 - Sit down first.

463
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,220
- This is so uncomfortable!
 - Please be seated.

464
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,050
- Your mother is well, right?
 - Yes, she is.

465
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,690
My mum is...

466
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,390
his friend!

467
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,620
(Hong Ryul is old enough to be Haha's eldest uncle.)

468
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,050
This is so uncomfortable.

469
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,320
Tell us anything you want us to do.

470
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,520
No, it's all right.

471
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,850
It's uncomfortable for us to be sitting down.

472
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,550
We're uncomfortable too.

473
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,850
Would you like some coffee?

474
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,050
- I'll get you coffee.
 - No, it's okay.

475
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,320
No, no. Please remain seated.

476
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,750
- That's not it!
 - No, it's all right.

477
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,750
- It's okay.
 - Sit back down.

478
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,220
- I will do it.
 - I'll get it.

479
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,820
- I'll get it myself.
 - Come back!

480
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,320
- Just stay still.
 - Please let us do it.

481
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,960
I was asking them if they wanted coffee.

482
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,750
- Please have a seat.
 - Don't go out.

483
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,350
- I can get it.
 - Please let us do it.

484
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,660
Please sit down.

485
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,220
- Oh, hello.
 - Hello.

486
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,890
- Hello.
 - Hello. What brings you here?

487
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,850
- Kil Kang is scary.
 - Hello.

488
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,120
- Jo Han!
 - Where did Mi Sun go?

489
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,020
I think she went to get coffee. Bring her back here.

490
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,820
Thank goodness. Won Hae only pretends to do things.

491
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,460
Won Hae is like that.

492
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,150
I'm not familiar with SBS, that's why.

493
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,020
Where is the reception area?

494
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,590
(If you teach me where it is, I will go make some coffee.)

495
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,850
Why are you looking for the reception area?

496
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,120
Stay seated, Won Hae. Don't do that.

497
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,320
(I need to earn bonus points too.)

498
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,820
Oh goodness, Won Hae.

499
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,250
(Here comes your coffee!)

500
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,520
Kil Kang and Mi Sun actually brought coffee for us.

501
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,690
- What?
 - This is crazy.

502
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,750
You didn't have to do that.

503
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,520
Why are you doing this?

504
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,750
(Their coffee delivery makes everyone uncomfortable.)

505
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,420
- Please have a seat.
 - I only asked if you wanted coffee.

506
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,250
- Here's your coffee, Sir.
 - Sir?

507
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,220
- What's wrong with you, Mi Sun?
 - There was no more coffee, so...

508
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,300
- I brought it from another office.
 - Please sit down.

509
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,320
(I should do something too.)

510
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,750
No, it's okay.

511
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,350
(He helps Ji Hyo take off her jacket.)

512
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,220
- What are you doing?
 - What is he doing?

513
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,090
- What are you doing, Won Hae?
 - Why is he doing that?

514
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,120
I'm envious.

515
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,120
(He helps his senior colleague with love.)

516
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,750
Just take a rest, Won Hae.

517
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,690
Why are you fanning her?

518
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,320
She said she's hot.

519
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,100
It's all right.

520
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,950
- Won Hae.
 - Have a seat.

521
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,990
- Won Hae.
 - Have a seat. I'll do it.

522
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,420
(It's time for the interns to introduce themselves.)

523
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,520
Let's have the interns introduce themselves.

524
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,420
Kil Kang, can I please ask you to introduce yourself?

525
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,920
- Yes, Sir.
 - Okay.

526
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,100
- Yes.
 - We should stand up too.

527
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,250
(Everyone stands up.)

528
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,090
- Please sit down.
 - Why did you have to do this?

529
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,050
Hello, everyone. My name is Kil Kang.

530
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,750
I am a new intern. It's very nice to meet you.

531
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,250
- Welcome.
 - Welcome.

532
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,650
My name is Won Hae. I am a new intern.

533
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,590
I will be working with Ji Hyo. It's nice to meet you.

534
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,750
- Welcome.
 - Welcome.

535
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,650
By the way, are you feeling well?

536
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,420
(I passed all the medical tests.)

537
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,950
- You look rather tired.
 - I am all right.

538
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,320
Are you really all right?

539
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,720
- You should take the afternoon off.
 - No, it's okay.

540
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,350
Are you really okay? All right, then.

541
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,920
(Next is Yoo Yeol's turn.)

542
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,220
This is my first time on a variety show.

543
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,320
(This is my first time on a variety show.)

544
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,850
(Yeol speaks in a delayed manner.)

545
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,050
This is my first time on a variety show.

546
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,490
Listen to his voice.

547
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,120
- He's like a radio show host.
 - I will warn you all.

548
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,210
His voice tone doesn't match with variety shows.

549
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,320
His voice doesn't match well with variety shows.

550
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,750
His voice is perfect for a morning radio show.

551
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,620
His voice is too gentle.

552
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,490
You should bear that in mind.

553
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,150
And once you find out how humane he is, you'll fall in love.

554
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,550
Please continue.

555
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,750
(He rests for one beat and starts talking.)

556
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,850
Recently...

557
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,460
(His voice is way too gentle.)

558
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,510
It's so refreshing.

559
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,120
You saw that, right?

560
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,210
- Yes.
 - It's morning.

561
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,900
I am Yoo Yeol. I will be an intern for Jae Seok.

562
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,320
(Welcome to Running Man!)

563
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,520
Is this really your first appearance on a variety show?

564
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,050
- Yes, it is.
 - It's your first time ever?

565
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,150
It's so nice to meet you all.

566
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,250
I didn't expect this kind of atmosphere.

567
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,320
(In 20 minutes, Yoo Yeol fell deeply in love with variety shows.)

568
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
The next person, please introduce yourself.

569
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,920
(Bowing)

570
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,120
(She bows to all her seniors at once by swinging her head.)

571
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,320
Hello.

572
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,750
I am an intern for Haha.

573
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,620
- My name is Miss Park.
 - Miss Park?

574
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,690
- It's nice to meet you.
 - Okay.

575
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,050
(We look forward to Miss Park's active presence today.)

576
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,920
- Goodness.
 - Yes.

577
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,320
I will give everything I have to serve Seok Jin well as his intern.

578
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,630
I hope he will torture me as much as he pleases.

579
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,950
My name is Hong Ryul.

580
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,950
(He's the godfather of comedy! Welcome, Hong Ryul.)

581
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,120
This is awesome.

582
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,650
Hello.

583
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,020
I am the youngest among all the interns today.

584
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,320
- He's right.
 - That's true.

585
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,750
He's the youngest intern.

586
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,950
I can't believe it either,

587
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,820
but I will serve Kwang Soo well today.

588
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,520
My name is Jo Han.

589
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,050
- Welcome.
 - Welcome.

590
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,150
Brilliant.

591
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,690
Why is he so late?

592
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,050
An intern should be on time.

593
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,960
This is the problem with interns.

594
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,690
They don't know how society goes around.

595
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,420
I should give him a good teaching when he comes.

596
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,650
Goodness.

597
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,890
(I'm sorry, I am late, Sir.)

598
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,490
(Who is the intern that surprised Jong Kook?)

599
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,750
- Hello.
 - Hello.

600
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,850
(It's Kim Do Kyoon, one of the three top guitarists in Korea.)

601
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:06,850
- Hello, Sir.
 - Hello.

602
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,890
- Thank you for coming.
 - No problem.

603
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,550
I knew this would happen.

604
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,210
I knew it.

605
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,590
Did you drink coffee yet?

606
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,490
No, it's all right.

607
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,320
- I'll get you coffee.
 - No, it's okay.

608
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,320
It's all right, I don't drink coffee.

609
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,750
- What would you like to drink?
 - I'll get you a cup of juice then.

610
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,150
No, I am all right.

611
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,550
- Please stay seated.
 - Okay.

612
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,990
- I have to learn a lot today.
 - Right.

613
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,850
This is so uncomfortable.

614
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,520
This is very uncomfortable.

615
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,490
One orange juice and...

616
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,120
one black coffee, please.

617
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,250
(Jong Kook acts very humble.)

618
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,920
- Will that be all?
 - Yes, that's right.

619
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,250
(Intern Kim Do Kyoon has long hair that overwhelms Jong Kook.)

620
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,850
(Kim Jong Kook and Kim Do Kyoon are 30 minutes late.)

621
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,850
Where should we go? Should we go this way?

622
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,720
This way? Okay.

623
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,650
- Oh, wow!
 - What?

624
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,850
Oh goodness.

625
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,290
- It's Kim Do Kyoon.
 - It's Do Kyoon.

626
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,650
- Hello.
 - Hello.

627
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,150
- Hello!
 - Do Kyoon is here.

628
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,490
- Hello.
 - Hello.

629
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,120
- Hello.
 - Oh goodness.

630
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,690
Oh dear.

631
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,590
Please introduce yourself.

632
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,420
- Introduce yourself, please.
 - I see.

633
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,420
Yes. I am... Well...

634
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,650
I came here...

635
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,620
as a new employee...

636
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,450
for Running Man.

637
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,320
Wait, I'm not an employee yet. I came here...

638
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,750
as an intern.

639
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,520
So...

640
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,390
I will learn a lot of things from Jong Kook...

641
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,990
and...

642
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,750
Speak up.

643
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,850
If you talk like that, you will be fired after the internship.

644
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,950
I see, okay.

645
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,420
(I'll work hard.)

646
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,490
- Please have a seat.
 - Okay.

647
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,320
- Please sit down first.
 - Okay.

648
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,920
- Goodness.
 - All right.

649
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,520
(What sound is this?)

650
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,750
This is an announcement.

651
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,120
Now, the training for the interns will begin.

652
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,420
The first game is "Pull from the Front and Put in the Back".

653
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,250
- Pull from the front?
 - All employees and interns...

654
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,220
should go to their places at this time.

655
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,490
"Pull from the Front and Put in the Back"?

656
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,220
(The interns first training test)

657
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,640
(Class 1, Pull from the Front and Put in the Back)

658
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,850
(The interns must move without their feet touching the floor...)

659
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,850
(and grab the trash bin with their feet.)

660
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,850
(Then their senior colleague will toss crumbled papers into the bin.)

661
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:34,050
(The team with the most number of paper balls will win.)

662
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,850
How do we move with this?

663
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,220
- Wow.
 - This is crazy.

664
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,350
I think it's going to be tough to move this.

665
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,950
- It's not easy to come here.
 - It's too difficult.

666
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,420
- You have to try hard.
 - Haha.

667
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,850
Please teach us your know-hows.

668
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,150
Cheat.

669
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,920
- Okay.
 - You're just like Song Ji Hyo!

670
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,690
- You got this, Miss Park!
 - I got this!

671
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,350
- Actually...
 - Miss Park!

672
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,220
- I am sorry, but...
 - Miss Park!

673
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,690
can I grab other intern's chairs?

674
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,350
- Of course you can.
 - Of course.

675
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,120
- It's strange not to grab them.
 - Don't do it.

676
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,490
- No.
 - Grab the two chairs...

677
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,850
beside you and push.

678
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,650
- Push the chairs beside you.
 - Yeol.

679
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,320
- Yeol,
 - You should be merciless.

680
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,590
- you can't be gentle.
 - Of course.

681
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,920
- Mi Sun.
 - Yes.

682
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,490
Good luck, Jo Han!

683
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,490
Good luck, Hong Ryul!

684
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,620
(The first training, Pull from the Front and Put in the Back)

685
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,850
- Go, team!
 - Go!

686
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,250
(What is he doing?)

687
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,250
(He moves faster than anyone.)

688
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,590
Can he do that?

689
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,640
He can do that. His feet didn't touch the floor.

690
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,520
You should come this way.

691
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,220
- You should do that too!
 - It's this way.

692
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,420
Go to the right!

693
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,320
- Come here.
 - Just like that.

694
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
- All right.
 - That's it.

695
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,720
That's ours.

696
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,550
- Come on.
 - Be careful.

697
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,220
Just step on the floor and move faster.

698
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,300
- You can step on the floor.
 - Do Kyoon.

699
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,620
- It's okay if you cheat.
 - Come on.

700
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,420
- Hold on.
 - Just step on the floor.

701
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,420
Just cheat, it's okay.

702
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,420
Put your feet on the floor and come here.

703
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,650
- Come here.
 - Do Kyoon.

704
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:56,950
Hurry up!

705
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,290
Stay there, Do Kyoon.

706
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,750
Come. Just come here.

707
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,430
Just come.

708
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,320
- Wait. You have to tilt it forward.
 - Grab the trash bin.

709
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,290
Just do it one by one.

710
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,990
(Focusing)

711
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,420
- Slowly.
 - Wait, hold on.

712
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,720
You have to catch the ball.

713
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,520
When I throw the ball, you have to receive it.

714
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,220
(The ball goes inside.)

715
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,420
You have to receive it. That's it.

716
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,150
- That's great.
 - Oh man.

717
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,850
- Good job.
 - Okay now.

718
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,750
Okay, this is good.

719
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,150
- That's it.
 - Tilt it towards me.

720
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,320
(It's not that easy.)

721
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,890
- How can you miss that?
 - Goodness.

722
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,750
- This is good.
 - It's not going in.

723
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,480
(Jae Seok and Yoo Yeol are also struggling.)

724
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,250
- Good job.
 - Why isn't it going in?

725
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,220
(Kwang Soo...)

726
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,850
(scores.)

727
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,150
- Throw some more!
 - That's it.

728
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,750
(Throwing)

729
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,320
- Move your legs.
 - Keep going.

730
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,350
- Okay.
 - Good.

731
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,540
- Let's go.
 - That's good.

732
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,120
Just get it in.

733
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,650
- Throw it slowly.
 - Hold on.

734
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,050
(It's not easy to get the ball in.)

735
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,250
- Go in!
 - No.

736
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,990
- Oh no.
 - My goodness.

737
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,550
It's really hard to get it in.

738
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,220
- Yes!
 - Okay, it went in.

739
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,950
- He's really good at this.
 - Oh no.

740
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,890
- Okay.
 - That's great.

741
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,120
Mi Sun, it's this one.

742
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,050
- I saw that.
 - It's not easy.

743
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,550
- What are you doing?
 - Kil Kang and Gary...

744
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,230
has none.

745
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,050
I have one.

746
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,550
Seok Jin...

747
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,950
has two.

748
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,450
- It went in at the last minute.
 - Exactly.

749
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,450
- It went in after.
 - Then, it's just one.

750
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,750
Just one.

751
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,950
Ji Hyo has one.

752
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,750
- Goodness.
 - How many are there?

753
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,830
Is it 3 or 4?

754
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,850
- Nice!
 - Isn't it only two?

755
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,550
- Isn't it three?
 - Let's be honest.

756
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,250
- It's two.
 - Okay.

757
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,950
- She's honest.
 - She's nice.

758
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,050
- Okay.
 - It's only two.

759
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,120
Mi Sun is honest.

760
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,020
- This is touching.
 - I'm sorry.

761
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,350
Kwang Soo has four.

762
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,050
We have four.

763
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,050
- Four?
 - There are really four.

764
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,350
- Are you sure?
 - Yes, we got four.

765
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,450
Really?

766
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:55,350
I swear. Look at it again.

767
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,750
Replay the video. Come on, go!

768
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,850
- Let's replay it.
 - Why don't you believe us?

769
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,650
- Wait.
 - He just swore.

770
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,050
- I think we should trust him.
 - Okay.

771
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,220
- He swore.
 - Goodness.

772
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,250
- There's only 1.
 - There are 2.

773
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,450
No, there are two.

774
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,550
One bounced off, so I put it back in.

775
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,240
Then it's only one.

776
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,750
- Okay.
 - You're too strict.

777
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,650
I'm not being strict.

778
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,350
- This is one.
 - That's too short.

779
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,550
- He's too strict.
 - He's right.

780
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,050
You guys are too honest.

781
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,950
Let's do it one more time.

782
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,550
- Let's go again.
 - Shall we?

783
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,650
- Yes.
 - I have a question.

784
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,250
Is it okay to go on the chair like Kil Kang?

785
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,220
- I think that's too fast.
 - I agree.

786
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,250
- Yes.
 - That's right.

787
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,220
- Wait a minute.
 - Okay.

788
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,550
Kil Kang started it first.

789
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,650
- Right.
 - No,

790
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,120
- wasn't it Yeol?
 - I'll give you a warning.

791
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,450
- No one said I can't do that.
 - I'll take one ball out.

792
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,550
- No one told me.
 - Exactly.

793
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,450
- Jo Han did that as well.
 - He pushed with his feet.

794
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,220
I'll take one out from Jo Han's bin too.

795
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,850
I just copied somebody else.

796
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,850
- I did it too.
 - I only copied someone.

797
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,820
I did it too.

798
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,220
Take one out then.

799
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,650
- Take one out.
 - Let's do it over again.

800
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,850
- Shall we?
 - Let's do it one more time.

801
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,450
- Let's follow the rules.
 - Does everyone agree?

802
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,950
Let's just do it here.

803
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,250
Let's play from here.

804
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,150
- Let's do that.
 - Okay, let me...

805
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,450
ask everyone.

806
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,950
- Tell me your opinions.
 - Okay.

807
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,750
- Do you want to do it here?
 - Ask him if we can use our feet.

808
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,950
Let's use our feet.

809
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,320
(They must choose between starting where they are or going back.)

810
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,650
- Okay.
 - Ask if we can use our feet.

811
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,950
Tell me your preference.

812
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,650
(Jae Seok listens carefully to what the interns have to say.)

813
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,350
I will start from here.

814
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,450
It's 2 to 2.

815
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,350
(It's Mi Sun's turn.)

816
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,450
Okay.

817
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,450
(Goodness)

818
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,850
(She whispered in his ears.)

819
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:31,950
What happened?

820
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,250
(Oh my goodness)

821
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,350
What did you just do?

822
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,450
- Goodness.
 - I didn't do anything.

823
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,750
- Come on.
 - Mi Sun.

824
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,120
- What is it?
 - What happened?

825
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,350
- I didn't do anything.
 - What is it?

826
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,450
- What was it?
 - Did you...

827
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,120
- blow in his ears?
 - No, I didn't.

828
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,120
- She sounded like Sharon Stone.
 - Come on.

829
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,920
What do you mean, Jae Seok?

830
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,820
- What did she do?
 - Did you blow in his ears?

831
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,650
- No, I didn't.
 - What I mean is...

832
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,850
she was really...

833
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,950
Jae Seok, I'm sure it wasn't your first time.

834
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,550
Come on.

835
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,120
(No one has done that to me before.)

836
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,540
She whispered,

837
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,250
"Let's do it here."

838
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,750
That's what she said.

839
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,430
All right.

840
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:05,350
(He continues to listen.)

841
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,750
I got it.

842
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,230
(Whispering)

843
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,050
Come on.

844
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,650
- What?
 - What is it?

845
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:13,750
- What is it?
 - I can hear him.

846
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,250
- I asked him, "Here or there?"
 - The start...

847
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,740
He said, "How about half-way?"

848
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,950
(Why not start from the middle?)

849
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,120
That's funny.

850
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,740
- That's a good idea.
 - I like that.

851
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,740
- He has a good idea.
 - Okay, then...

852
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,950
I'll tell you the result.

853
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,050
- That's cute.
 - Do Kyoon wants a half-way start,

854
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,350
and four people want to start here.

855
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,650
So we'll start here.

856
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,020
- Okay.
 - That's great.

857
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,220
Let's pick the balls up.

858
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,150
- Let's start.
 - Throw one at a time.

859
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,820
- Don't throw multiples.
 - Okay.

860
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,850
Let's do it.

861
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,350
- You have 30 seconds.
 - Okay.

862
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,450
Okay, good.

863
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,550
- Ready.
 - What are you doing?

864
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,950
Wait a minute.

865
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:49,220
Put your shoes on.

866
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,450
It's slippery because you have no shoes on.

867
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,320
What's the reason?

868
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,140
- Put your shoes on.
 - I'll hold the bin like this.

869
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,650
I told you it's slippery.

870
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,750
Are you sure he's younger than me?

871
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,850
- I'm trying to get the right angle.
 - Come on.

872
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,150
Why are you all so stubborn?

873
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,350
Just do it.

874
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,750
- Let's just do it.
 - These interns don't listen.

875
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,950
- Oh goodness.
 - Come on.

876
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,750
I feel like they are company CEOs.

877
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,950
- Come on.
 - Put your shoes on!

878
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,730
Please put your shoes back on!

879
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,550
(I don't want to.)

880
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,640
- My goodness.
 - He won't listen.

881
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,020
Am I supposed to wash your feet?

882
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,920
Come on, Yeol.

883
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,450
No, I can do it.

884
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,750
- Okay.
 - He got it.

885
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,850
- I can hold it for 30 seconds.
 - Okay.

886
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,550
- I got it.
 - Ready.

887
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,720
Throw one at a time.

888
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,750
- Okay.
 - Ready.

889
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,850
Go!

890
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,050
(Round two starts.)

891
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,950
(They only need to shoot.)

892
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,120
Do it slowly.

893
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,250
(They just need to get the balls in the bin.)

894
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,950
(Kwang Soo shoots well.)

895
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,950
It's not going in.

896
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,250
My goodness.

897
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,220
(Kwang Soo gets it in again.)

898
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,450
That was too short.

899
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,750
Try again.

900
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,850
- Quickly.
 - Great.

901
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,250
- Okay.
 - Goodness.

902
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,950
- Keep going.
 - Okay.

903
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,250
Keep going.

904
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,650
Move your feet.

905
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,850
- Okay.
 - That's great.

906
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,150
- Go ahead.
 - We have to keep going.

907
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,750
- There's not much time left.
 - Oh my.

908
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,750
(They all get the balls in the bin.)

909
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,850
- Go slowly.
 - Keep it up.

910
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,550
(Let's do this, Do Kyoon.)

911
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,150
(Oh my gosh)

912
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,750
- Slowly.
 - Keep going.

913
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,750
Keep shooting.

914
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,550
(He moves the bin.)

915
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,790
What are you doing?

916
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,050
- Good job.
 - Keep going.

917
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,950
You got this!

918
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,250
(Do Kyoon turns the trash can.)

919
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,530
(Do Kyoon is blocking the balls.)

920
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,500
- Great job.
 - Keep it up.

921
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,520
Keep going.

922
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,250
Keep trying.

923
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,650
We need to keep trying. There's not much time left.

924
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,450
(Round two is over.)

925
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,750
Let go of the bin.

926
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,150
We had two that bounced off.

927
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,950
- I think we got a lot in the bin.
 - We got a lot in.

928
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,050
Yeol, why did you raise your hand?

929
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:47,120
I want to go on more variety shows.

930
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,820
(He declares his desire to enter the field of variety shows.)

931
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,350
Isn't it fun, Yeol?

932
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,150
We had two that bounced off.

933
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,120
- Kil Kang and Gary...
 - Yes.

934
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,930
- has one.
 - One.

935
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:02,120
- Don't be surprised, everyone.
 - Okay.

936
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,450
There's 1, 2, 3, 4...

937
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,950
- and 5, 6 and 7.
 - Really?

938
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,950
(They have seven!)

939
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,950
- Goodness.
 - That's great.

940
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,320
- That's a lot.
 - That's awesome.

941
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,550
- This team has 1, 2, 3, 4.
 - I should take off my shoes.

942
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,650
- Oh wow.
 - Two balls bounced off.

943
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:20,750
They got a lot of balls in.

944
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,850
This team also has a lot.

945
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:25,750
They have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

946
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,850
(Ji Hyo and Won Hae have five.)

947
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,650
They are getting better.

948
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,220
(Mi Sun previously had two.)

949
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,620
Okay, one!

950
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:37,050
(Why is only our team like this?)

951
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:41,450
This team has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

952
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,650
(Kwang Soo and Jo Han have five.)

953
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,450
(What is this?)

954
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,650
(The two...)

955
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,750
(look at each other...)

956
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,220
(and smile.)

957
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,550
I have never...

958
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,050
seen someone block everything.

959
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,150
It was about to go in and he moved the trash can.

960
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,720
He moved it like this.

961
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,050
(Laughing)

962
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,720
- He looks happy.
 - Why did you do that?

963
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,220
We needed to have a connection.

964
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,240
But we didn't start out right.

965
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,450
I mean...

966
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:14,350
- it was my fault.
 - I think...

967
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,620
you didn't catch the balls well.

968
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,450
That's true.

969
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,560
(Results: Kwang Soo 9, Jae Seok 8, Ji Hyo 6, Seok Jin 5,)

970
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,450
(Haha 3, Gary 1 and Jong Kook 1)

971
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,250
Let's hear what the interns...

972
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,250
- think about the first test.
 - Okay.

973
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,050
How about Yeol?

974
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,250
Well, from the beginning...

975
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,020
Could you please speak faster?

976
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,250
Please talk faster.

977
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,850
I think Jae Seok and I are good partners.

978
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:44,950
(We have a good partnership.)

979
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,060
(Yeol is getting used to variety shows.)

980
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,620
How about Hong Ryul?

981
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,620
I want to try one more time.

982
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,860
Well then...

983
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,150
how about Jo Han?

984
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,850
I think our team is really great.

985
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,420
- Is that true?
 - Wow.

986
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,420
I'm sorry, but you're sitting like a judge from "K-POP Star".

987
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,750
I'm sorry.

988
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,560
- I think our team is really great.
 - Is that true?

989
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,950
(Jo Han will choose Running Man.)

990
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,450
I'm sorry.

991
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,250
- His posture was like this.
 - It was the posture of a panel.

992
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,750
Don't forget...

993
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,560
that you're an intern.

994
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,250
- He's a rude intern.
 - I'm sorry.

995
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,050
(I'm sorry.)

996
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:24,950
(Class 2: Partners Run Errands)

997
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,420
(While the senior member calls out the intern's name,)

998
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,450
(the intern has to bring five items requested by the senior member.)

999
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:34,750
(The interns will be ranked by the number of items that they bring.)

1000
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,560
- Can I sit here?
 - Of course.

1001
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,850
- Of course, Sir.
 - And by the way,

1002
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,450
- Yes.
 - I was watching and...

1003
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,850
in the beginning, everyone...

1004
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:45,050
was acting like a real intern.

1005
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,750
But now they are beginning to act like themselves.

1006
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,750
- Really?
 - Look at how Hong Ryul is sitting.

1007
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,950
(A veteran comedian)

1008
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,440
Look at his posture.

1009
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,560
I think I need to scold them.

1010
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,060
- What do you mean?
 - Well...

1011
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,150
I should.

1012
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,750
- What are you talking about?
 - It's strange.

1013
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,320
It doesn't feel good to be...

1014
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,150
treated ill like this after being treated so well.

1015
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,620
I'm sorry, but let me speak casually with you.

1016
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,550
- Of course, Sir.
 - I was kidding.

1017
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,850
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1018
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,950
Wouldn't it be better if the interns...

1019
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,560
- play it?
 - I think so too.

1020
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,150
Let's have the young ones play.

1021
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,750
- Wait.
 - What?

1022
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,250
- What?
 - Aren't you an intern?

1023
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,750
- He sounds like a boss.
 - Yes.

1024
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,540
Let's start from the top.

1025
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,650
- What?
 - I mean from the oldest.

1026
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,140
(Start from the oldest!)

1027
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,350
(The interns are outspoken.)

1028
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,860
Shall we start from the oldest?

1029
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,120
- We are all equals.
 - Why don't we play a game?

1030
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,360
Do you know the number game?

1031
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,750
- Play the number game.
 - Okay.

1032
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,120
- Just the interns.
 - Only the interns should play.

1033
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,140
- One.
 - Two.

1034
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,650
- Three.
 - Four.

1035
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:45,850
- Five.
 - Six.

1036
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:47,450
Seven.

1037
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,690
- It's seven.
 - Why did you do that?

1038
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,150
You're out when you say seven.

1039
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,850
- Is that right?
 - He aimed for seven.

1040
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,450
He's so innocent.

1041
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,850
You're very charming.

1042
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,060
He is charming.

1043
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,250
There's something going on between these two.

1044
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:04,650
- I think you're right.
 - Aren't you older than me?

1045
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,850
No, I'm not.

1046
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,850
- What year were you born in?
 - I was born in 1969.

1047
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,950
He's younger than me?

1048
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,360
Yes, that's right.

1049
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,560
(He is two years younger than Mi Sun.)

1050
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,350
Won Hae will go first.

1051
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,690
Then I'll go. The game is to number six.

1052
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,450
- Get ready.
 - Wait.

1053
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,950
Why am I not allowed to say seven?

1054
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,560
- It's the last number.
 - That means you're out.

1055
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,560
You're out if you say the last number.

1056
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,520
- It's the last number.
 - Play some games once in a while.

1057
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,650
- It's up to number six.
 - Right now...

1058
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,350
- the game is to number 6.
 - Number 6.

1059
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,250
- Get ready.
 - Get ready.

1060
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,750
- Am I out?
 - Yes.

1061
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,250
- Start!
 - One.

1062
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,360
- Two.
 - Two.

1063
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,950
(They're both out of the game.)

1064
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,060
They're out.

1065
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,250
- Since two more people are out,
 - We're doing it again?

1066
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,150
the game is to number four.

1067
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,060
- It's all right.
 - What are we going to do?

1068
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,550
- Four.
 - It's okay.

1069
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,850
(What is he doing?)

1070
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,890
Four.

1071
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,750
- Wait a minute.
 - You're out if you say four.

1072
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,360
- Why did you say four?
 - What?

1073
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,950
Kil Kang, you're out.

1074
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,250
- Kil Kang, you're out.
 - Why did you do that?

1075
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,650
(Kil Kang is dazed.)

1076
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,750
Kil Kang, why did you say four?

1077
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,750
Why did you say it suddenly?

1078
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,750
He was fiddling with his wrist and suddenly, he rose and said four.

1079
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,050
I was surprised.

1080
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,720
- He is so cute.
 - Okay then.

1081
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,950
- Now the game is to three.
 - Right.

1082
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,350
- Who's left?
 - Get ready. I won't answer that.

1083
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,950
Get ready. If you're still in, please participate.

1084
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,750
- Start.
 - One.

1085
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,490
- Two.
 - Three.

1086
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,030
He's out.

1087
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,250
- You're out when you say three.
 - You're out.

1088
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,490
(Kil Kang doesn't know what to do.)

1089
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:29,520
- You're out since you said three.
 - You said three.

1090
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,060
- Why did you stand up?
 - Why were you standing?

1091
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,450
I thought I was still in the game.

1092
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,590
He is really cute.

1093
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,350
(Will the interns be reliable in the real game?)

1094
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:40,550
(Running Man: The Interns)

1095
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,750
Get ready.

1096
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,250
(Partners Run Errands Game)

1097
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,850
It's team Won Hae and Ji Hyo.

1098
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:47,690
Get ready, go.

1099
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:50,060
Tape, work gloves,

1100
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,590
an eraser, correction tape and a snack.

1101
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:57,060
Tape, work gloves, an eraser, correction tape and a snack.

1102
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,250
- Tape and...
 - Go.

1103
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,750
work gloves.

1104
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:02,490
- Kim Won Hae.
 - Won Hae already forgot.

1105
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,890
(The time is how long the intern's name is called in one breath.)

1106
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,990
(Moving quickly)

1107
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,150
Tape and work gloves...

1108
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,360
(He already found something?)

1109
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:19,050
(An intern should be fast.)

1110
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:24,550
(He is like a flash of lightning.)

1111
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,990
(Did he find another item already?)

1112
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,950
(This intern is doing great.)

1113
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,550
The A4 paper.

1114
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,950
The A4 paper.

1115
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,320
She has reached her limit.

1116
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,250
- The A4 paper.
 - The A4 paper.

1117
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,490
Grab the paper.

1118
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,750
- The slippers.
 - Grab the scarf.

1119
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,530
(He found it.)

1120
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,050
Hey.

1121
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,950
Hey!

1122
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,920
Hey!

1123
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:51,750
(I gave it my all.)

1124
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,950
- Oh wow.
 - Goodness.

1125
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:57,250
(This is the right way to assist a senior colleague.)

1126
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,790
- Wow.
 - Oh wow.

1127
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,720
This isn't it.

1128
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,150
(Goodness)

1129
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,150
(It's not?)

1130
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,720
This isn't it.

1131
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,950
(It was a useless effort.)

1132
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,750
- You have to find the tape first.
 - Ji Hyo must be really annoyed.

1133
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,560
- She really must be.
 - She probably is.

1134
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,150
It's all right.

1135
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,020
(Ji Hyo and Won Hae succeed in finding three items.)

1136
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,150
Next up is team Jo Han and Kwang Soo.

1137
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,750
I have to say the name, right?

1138
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:29,020
(Whispering)

1139
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,280
Kwang Soo is the intern in this team, right?

1140
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,690
No. Why? Isn't it obvious?

1141
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,250
It's obvious that Kwang Soo is the intern.

1142
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,590
No, Kwang Soo is the senior...

1143
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:41,060
- and I'm the intern.
 - Good luck with that.

1144
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,750
- You have 10 seconds to read it.
 - Okay.

1145
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,420
On your mark, get set, go.

1146
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,950
A blank CD, an air freshener,

1147
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,450
work gloves, a ruler and paperwork.

1148
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:52,350
A blank CD, an air freshener, work gloves, a ruler and paperwork.

1149
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,350
It's CD, air, work, ruler and paper.

1150
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,850
- A blank CD, an air...
 - He's making it more confusing.

1151
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:59,590
- Because of that.
 - You're right.

1152
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,060
- Jo Han lived abroad for a while.
 - Right.

1153
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,650
Kwang Soo should have said it in English.

1154
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:07,280
Hong Ryul, you shouldn't be standing over there.

1155
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,950
(Jo Han found the ruler.)

1156
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,350
Why did he find the ruler? That wasn't on the list.

1157
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:13,720
Jo Han.

1158
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,650
- Was it on the list?
 - Was it really?

1159
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,250
That was on the list.

1160
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,820
- Kwang Soo is nearly done.
 - The USB.

1161
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,750
I don't remember.

1162
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,490
Didn't Kwang Soo stop?

1163
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,750
- That wasn't on the list.
 - The scarf.

1164
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,950
(Kwang Soo is frustrated.)

1165
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:30,140
- Jo Han!
 - This is funny.

1166
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,250
- What are you doing?
 - Kwang Soo is angry.

1167
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,560
- What are you doing, Jo Han?
 - Kwang Soo.

1168
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,750
Wasn't this on the list?

1169
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,350
- The ruler was on the list.
 - I know.

1170
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,060
I told you. It's CD, air, work, ruler and paper.

1171
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,250
There was a pair of work gloves in there.

1172
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,350
I couldn't find the blank CD.

1173
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:44,550
What are you going to do with just a ruler?

1174
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:47,150
(Kwang Soo and Jo Han found only one item.)

1175
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,750
- We are next.
 - It's a pity.

1176
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,490
He looks like Robert De Niro from "The Intern".

1177
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,150
- He does look like Robert De Niro.
 - He really does.

1178
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,590
- He looks exactly like him.
 - You're right.

1179
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:56,350
- He has a similar vibe.
 - Hong Ryul looks like him.

1180
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,360
- They're similar in age too.
 - Right.

1181
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,850
- Yes.
 - He looks like Robert De Niro.

1182
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,720
- Say one item per second.
 - One item per second.

1183
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,350
- Since we have 10 seconds.
 - Okay, 1 item per second.

1184
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,850
- One item per second.
 - Let's see.

1185
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,350
- Go.
 - It's a bit different.

1186
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:10,150
A calculator, coloured paper,

1187
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:12,750
tea, paper cup and a book.

1188
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,950
Calculator, colour, tea, cup and book.

1189
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,950
- A calculator, coloured paper,
 - Coloured paper.

1190
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,290
- Tea.
 - Tea, paper cup and book.

1191
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:20,850
- A calculator.
 - Go.

1192
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,250
Lee Hong Ryul.

1193
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:25,850
Paper, calculator and coloured paper.

1194
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,250
(Goodness)

1195
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,520
Hong Ryul.

1196
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,650
(The game is over in five seconds.)

1197
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,340
Hong Ryul, it's over.

1198
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:39,550
Why?

1199
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,750
Seok Jin!

1200
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:41,850
(Gosh!)

1201
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,020
And you call yourself a singer?

1202
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,950
(I am a sinner.)

1203
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,650
I got something in my throat.

1204
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:48,750
(Seok Jin has weak lungs.)

1205
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,350
- What is he doing?
 - I lost my breath.

1206
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:53,450
I didn't get why you were stopping him.

1207
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:54,850
It was just too funny.

1208
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,950
Seok Jin is really...

1209
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,350
- Isn't he funny?
 - Yes, he is.

1210
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,930
Later,

1211
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:03,400
you'll see how different Ryul can be pronounced.

1212
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,750
(By this guy over here)

1213
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,650
I'm sorry Hong Ryul.

1214
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,450
You should consult me before saying something like that.

1215
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,550
Okay.

1216
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:15,150
- Next up is team Gary and Kil Kang.
 - Right.

1217
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,230
- Let's go.
 - We can do it.

1218
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:19,550
- Gary has a long breath.
 - Let's go.

1219
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:22,620
When looking solely at the physical aspect,

1220
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,250
Kil Kang seems unbeatable.

1221
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,150
But he's the worst of us here.

1222
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,740
He also has the worst concentration.

1223
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,490
A mechanical pencil, toothbrush set,

1224
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:34,250
highlighter, staples and USB.

1225
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,720
A mechanical pencil, toothbrush set,

1226
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,950
highlighter, staples and USB.

1227
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,920
- Why does he stress the set?
 - Toothbrush set.

1228
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:43,150
- Why does he stress it?
 - Highlighter, staples and USB.

1229
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:45,050
I don't know what a USB is.

1230
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,350
Ahn Kil Kang.

1231
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:49,750
Mechanical pencil.

1232
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,640
Grab the squid.

1233
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,250
Kil Kang, it's the squid.

1234
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,620
- Kil Kang, the squid.
 - Was it really on the list?

1235
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,750
(He passes the second cabinet.)

1236
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,950
- You shouldn't leave the door open.
 - He's in a rush.

1237
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,720
If you leave the cabinet door open, we can all see what's inside.

1238
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,450
(No matter how long I look...)

1239
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:04,450
- I can't remember a thing.
 - The eraser is over there.

1240
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:08,750
(What is he saying?)

1241
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,150
(Gary is out of breath.)

1242
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,650
It's over.

1243
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,150
It's over.

1244
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,530
He didn't have anything on his mind.

1245
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,640
He was just looking around.

1246
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,250
Do you know what a USB is?

1247
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:26,850
- I don't know.
 - He doesn't even know what it is.

1248
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:28,150
What do you know from the list?

1249
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:30,750
I memorised mechanical pencil and toothbrush set.

1250
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:31,950
(Gary feels betrayed.)

1251
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:34,150
Then why did you go?

1252
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:35,950
You shouldn't have left then.

1253
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:37,950
- Oh, Kil Kang.
 - What is this?

1254
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,150
He's hilarious.

1255
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:41,650
- It's hilarious today.
 - It really is.

1256
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,050
- We're next.
 - Wow.

1257
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,650
(The fifth team is team Jae Seok and Yoo Yeol.)

1258
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:48,490
Jae Seok, show us your lung capacity.

1259
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:50,140
- Sure.
 - Okay?

1260
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,630
I didn't agree to that.

1261
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,850
Yeol told us differently.

1262
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:57,850
Spray glue, clips.

1263
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:59,750
What's spray glue?

1264
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:02,350
Green tea, chain ring and a note.

1265
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:05,690
- I can't memorise a thing.
 - Spray glue, clips,

1266
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:07,820
- green tea, chain ring and a note.
 - Start.

1267
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,150
What's a chain ring?

1268
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:12,750
Yoo Yeol.

1269
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,550
I can't hear a thing.

1270
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,950
We can't hear Jae Seok at all.

1271
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:18,550
(Yeol is taking his time.)

1272
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,650
I think he can do it.

1273
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,490
(Searches thoroughly)

1274
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:23,350
He looks like he's out for a stroll.

1275
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:28,150
He looks like he's out for a stroll.

1276
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:30,250
(Pronouncing Yeol is easy for me.)

1277
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:33,150
(No, it isn't.)

1278
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,830
Why?

1279
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,620
- It's over?
 - It was too funny.

1280
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,250
(Jae Seok and Yoo Yeol found zero items.)

1281
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,850
Next up is Do Kyoon and Jong Kook.

1282
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:42,450
(The sixth team is Do Kyoon and Jong Kook.)

1283
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:45,350
(How will the two work as a team?)

1284
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:46,950
Look at his hair.

1285
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:50,250
Batteries, strands of ribbon, a pen,

1286
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,690
slippers and a ruler.

1287
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:55,850
Batteries, strands of ribbon, a pen, slippers and a ruler.

1288
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:57,590
Battery, ribbon, pen, slipper and ruler.

1289
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,350
- Ribbon pen?
 - No, strands of ribbon.

1290
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:00,950
- Strands of ribbon.
 - Slipper and ribbon.

1291
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,750
- Slipper and ribbon.
 - Okay.

1292
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:06,620
Kim Do Kyoon.

1293
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,450
Do Kyoon looks like an adorable housewife.

1294
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,890
He looks like an adorable housewife.

1295
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:15,350
(Do Kyoon quickly finds one item.)

1296
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:19,150
- He's really fast.
 - Close the door.

1297
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,690
- You should close the door.
 - There's the coloured paper.

1298
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,050
(He cleared three cabinets already.)

1299
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:25,690
(He is as fast as lightning.)

1300
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:26,950
- Oh wow.
 - He's nearly done.

1301
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,150
Really?

1302
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:30,350
- Already?
 - He has three items.

1303
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:32,650
(Do Kyoon has very quick hands.)

1304
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:35,530
(Charming)

1305
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:37,620
What are you doing?

1306
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,150
Jong Kook is really doing well.

1307
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:41,620
- He's still at it.
 - He has the longest breath.

1308
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:44,350
Should we go and punch him?

1309
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:48,520
- He has more than five items.
 - He has so many.

1310
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,450
- How many items are you taking?
 - Do Kyoon!

1311
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,420
- Were there that many items?
 - Why do you have so many items?

1312
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:59,220
(He swept the cabinets.)

1313
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,920
How many did you pick up?

1314
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,050
What is this?

1315
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:05,420
- How many are there?
 - You picked up so many.

1316
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,950
- I just picked up as many as I can.
 - But...

1317
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,520
gloves weren't included.

1318
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,150
You said you have a good memory.

1319
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:13,850
- He just picked up whatever.
 - He said he has a good memory.

1320
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:16,650
- I heard him talking before.
 - Yes?

1321
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:18,850
He said that he went on another show...

1322
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:20,620
and was tested to have the best memory there.

1323
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:21,750
So then he must have...

1324
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:24,220
remembered all of the previous items as well.

1325
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,220
He remembered everything else.

1326
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,390
- That must be why.
 - I remembered everything.

1327
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,520
- We have a ruler here.
 - Okay.

1328
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,420
- We also have a pen.
 - Slippers, too.

1329
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,020
- Slippers are here.
 - Slippers.

1330
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,550
And then...

1331
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:38,320
- Where's the ribbon?
 - I forgot that one.

1332
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,550
(I forgot that one.)

1333
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:41,520
- He finally gets a scolding.
 - Where are the batteries?

1334
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,750
I told you about the batteries before we started.

1335
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:47,250
I forgot the batteries and a ribbon.

1336
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,750
- We have three.
 - I forgot.

1337
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,120
You should have remembered the batteries.

1338
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,650
You're right.

1339
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:54,150
Jong Kook is getting angry.

1340
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:56,540
- Good job, Do Kyoon.
 - At least...

1341
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,420
- I got three.
 - Right.

1342
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,990
(Jong Kook and Do Kyoon found three items.)

1343
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:02,320
(The results)

1344
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,620
(Rank 1: Jong Kook and Do Kyoon, Ji Hyo and Won Hae)

1345
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,150
(Class 3 begins.)

1346
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:11,220
- Hurry up.
 - Can we go first?

1347
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,520
Interns!

1348
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,220
(We prepared this for you.)

1349
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,050
(Have a good time!)

1350
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:20,120
- Oh, my.
 - It's been a while.

1351
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,850
- The acupressure mat.
 - It's an acupressure mat.

1352
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:24,220
- The interns...
 - Interns need to experience this.

1353
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:25,740
(Interns need to experience this.)

1354
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,850
- Oh, my.
 - Can I have my socks on?

1355
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:29,520
- It hurts so much.
 - It's awful.

1356
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,750
It must hurt a lot.

1357
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,720
- It'll hurt so much.
 - Put your feet on it.

1358
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,050
- It hurts a lot.
 - It's terrible.

1359
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:35,150
- Have you tried it?
 - It really hurts.

1360
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,320
- You must have tried it a lot.
 - It's awful.

1361
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,720
By the way,

1362
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,750
- I'm getting nervous.
 - I'm sorry to say this, but...

1363
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,020
why don't you guys just quit being our interns?

1364
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,720
You're all getting ruder.

1365
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,520
"Hey, does it hurt a lot?"

1366
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,050
- Was I like that?
 - Yes, you were.

1367
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:51,720
I was worried about you, Sir.

1368
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,520
Why are you suddenly calling me "Sir"?

1369
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,690
Sir.

1370
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:55,950
(I should behave.)

1371
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:57,840
I've never lost to anyone in this game.

1372
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,720
Mi Sun, take your socks off.

1373
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,910
- How will it go?
 - You have only one chance.

1374
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:03,320
And as you all know,

1375
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,420
even though we can't touch the player, we can still interrupt...

1376
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:07,050
- the player in other ways.
 - Yes, of course.

1377
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:08,750
- As long as you don't touch them.
 - You can still...

1378
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,520
interrupt them.

1379
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,220
- But you can't touch them.
 - You can't.

1380
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,520
- You can't touch them.
 - Okay.

1381
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,620
You have only one chance.

1382
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,720
Go, Haha!

1383
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,050
- Go!
 - It's over when you jump.

1384
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:18,720
- It's over when you jump.
 - It's been too long.

1385
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,150
- It's over once you jump.
 - He has bad posture.

1386
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:21,420
- It's over when you jump.
 - Okay.

1387
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,120
- Stay away.
 - Don't worry.

1388
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,220
(One, two)

1389
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,820
- Go, Haha!
 - Let's go!

1390
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:28,120
Oh, my goodness!

1391
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,620
(Jae Seok distracts Haha.)

1392
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,300
What? This is acceptable.

1393
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,290
- Oh, my goodness.
 - Goodness.

1394
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:35,750
- You can't jump.
 - My goodness.

1395
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,320
- Don't do that.
 - Hey!

1396
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,850
If you can't jump, it's over.

1397
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:41,120
(Jumping)

1398
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,050
What a coward.

1399
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:45,320
(Haha jumped 1m 40cm.)

1400
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,220
- That's not bad.
 - He jumped pretty far.

1401
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,690
This is not easy.

1402
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:50,050
I think Jae Seok will jump far.

1403
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,750
(Jong Kook puts his foot near Jae Seok.)

1404
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,320
- Jae Seok.
 - Don't do it.

1405
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,420
- Step back, everybody.
 - We didn't do anything.

1406
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,950
- Don't you dare.
 - We didn't touch you.

1407
00:49:57,950 --> 00:49:59,650
I'm not going to forgive you.

1408
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:01,420
Our interns...

1409
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:02,750
are massaging their feet.

1410
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,390
(The interns are massaging their feet on the mat.)

1411
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:06,120
You can't do that here.

1412
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,220
We're not in a spa right now.

1413
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,520
My goodness.

1414
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,020
- This is not a spa.
 - People do this at the spa.

1415
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:15,620
- Be nice to Jae Seok when he jumps.
 - Sure.

1416
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,720
- His voice is so soft.
 - It drains all my energy.

1417
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,150
- My energy is gone.
 - It makes me tired.

1418
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,750
- His voice has a strange impact.
 - It drains all of your energy.

1419
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,220
I feel like I'm bathing in warm water.

1420
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,620
His voice...

1421
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:28,220
makes your shoulders drop.

1422
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,820
It feels like it's 2am.

1423
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:33,120
(Jae Seok prepares to jump.)

1424
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,520
- Don't do that.
 - I didn't do anything.

1425
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,950
He almost fell on his own.

1426
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,150
- Here I go!
 - Wow!

1427
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:38,220
(Jumping)

1428
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,050
(A flying grasshopper)

1429
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:42,920
- Now you just have to stand up.
 - Stand up.

1430
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,950
- It hurts.
 - He did well.

1431
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:46,220
Oh goodness.

1432
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:47,740
It hurts.

1433
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,150
(The mat increases blood circulation.)

1434
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:50,620
- He jumped far.
 - It hurts.

1435
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,750
Wow.

1436
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,350
- It's Kwang Soo's turn.
 - I think I can get second place.

1437
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,220
I think Kwang Soo will jump well.

1438
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,750
- Wow.
 - Look at how big his feet are.

1439
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,120
- He looks like a giraffe.
 - Don't step on the line.

1440
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,220
- They look like monster's feet.
 - Please don't step on the line.

1441
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:04,200
- Step away from the line.
 - Okay.

1442
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,750
- He's right.
 - What are you doing?

1443
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,350
What did you say?

1444
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,320
Watch your toenails. You might trip over.

1445
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,150
(Jong Kook is ready to interrupt him.)

1446
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:13,740
Here I go.

1447
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,620
- What are you doing?
 - Nothing.

1448
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,420
- It's nothing.
 - Don't do that.

1449
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:21,210
- Go.
 - In 3, 2, 1.

1450
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:22,720
- Jump!
 - Don't do that!

1451
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:26,220
(They pulled off Kwang Soo's microphone.)

1452
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,950
- It was here.
 - He landed over here.

1453
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,220
- It was about here.
 - Right here.

1454
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:30,620
- It was over here.
 - Is that acceptable?

1455
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,210
This is acceptable?

1456
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:33,690
- Is that acceptable?
 - We didn't touch you.

1457
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,150
- We only touched your microphone.
 - Only the microphone.

1458
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:36,850
- We didn't touch you.
 - We didn't.

1459
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:38,720
What if I pull someone's hair?

1460
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,050
It was only the microphone.

1461
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:41,520
- Next.
 - It's Gary's turn.

1462
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,850
- We won't do anything.
 - I'm going to jump right away.

1463
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,450
(The fourth player is Gary.)

1464
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,620
(Twisting)

1465
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,320
(Kwang Soo twisted Gary's arm.)

1466
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,050
- Why? What happened?
 - It was before he jumped.

1467
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:52,420
Kwang Soo.

1468
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:54,720
You didn't jump yet.

1469
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,050
Jump as fast as you can.

1470
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:59,250
(You have to jump far and fast.)

1471
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,850
This is annoying.

1472
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:03,320
Don't let them stop you.

1473
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,450
(Here I go.)

1474
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:06,120
- Hurry and jump.
 - That hurts.

1475
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,320
(Splashing)

1476
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,520
(They splash water on Gary's face.)

1477
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,120
- It's cold.
 - He looks like a squid.

1478
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,120
- Gary.
 - This is too much.

1479
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,420
Look, Gary's a squid under water.

1480
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,100
It's a squid in the water.

1481
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,120
(A squid in the water)

1482
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,490
Gary looks like a squid.

1483
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:22,750
This is hilarious.

1484
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:24,850
(Will Gary be able to jump well after the distraction?)

1485
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,310
Wait, hold on.

1486
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,620
Here I go.

1487
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:29,950
Go, Gary! Now!

1488
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:31,420
- Jump now.
 - Wow.

1489
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,020
(Flying)

1490
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,120
- He jumped far.
 - He did well.

1491
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,220
Oh wow.

1492
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,000
(Gary jumped 2m 35cm.)

1493
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,750
He jumped more than 2m.

1494
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:41,750
- Good job.
 - It's 2m 35cm.

1495
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:43,420
Who's next? Ji Hyo?

1496
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:45,520
It's my turn.

1497
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,720
Amazing.

1498
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,420
Please.

1499
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:52,310
- Should we have a meeting?
 - Sure.

1500
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:53,750
(The members discuss how they will distract Jong Kook.)

1501
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,750
We need to do something to Jong Kook.

1502
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,320
- Of course.
 - Let's discuss.

1503
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,850
Guys,

1504
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:00,150
let's not do this.

1505
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:02,220
- I haven't done anything.
 - Okay, just go.

1506
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,950
- I haven't done anything.
 - Everybody's waiting for you.

1507
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:05,750
- Okay.
 - The interns are waiting.

1508
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:08,850
(Jong Kook hits Kwang Soo.)

1509
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:10,740
Step back.

1510
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,520
- Why?
 - What happened?

1511
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,120
What happened?

1512
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,850
What just happened?

1513
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:18,120
(We heard something break.)

1514
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,750
- It must have hurt a lot.
 - He hit Kwang Soo hard.

1515
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:21,690
(Kwang Soo is in pain.)

1516
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:23,750
- What should we do?
 - Kwang Soo.

1517
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,420
- Are you okay?
 - Are you all right?

1518
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:26,720
Kwang Soo, are you all right?

1519
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,520
I didn't do anything.

1520
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,950
I'm going now.

1521
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:32,320
(Playing the xylophone)

1522
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,850
- "National Singing Contest"!
 - Singing Contest!

1523
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:36,220
- Look.
 - Look at this.

1524
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,850
- He crossed the line.
 - No, I didn't.

1525
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:40,490
- Jong Kook crossed the line.
 - I didn't jump yet.

1526
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:41,950
- Did you see that?
 - It doesn't count.

1527
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:45,220
(Stirring of events)

1528
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:47,050
- You crossed the line.
 - I was just walking.

1529
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:48,850
- Really now.
 - I didn't jump.

1530
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,950
(Jong Kook silenced everyone.)

1531
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:52,420
- Here I go!
 - I'll give you a countdown.

1532
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:54,050
In 3, 2, 1.

1533
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:55,520
- Let's go!
 - Go!

1534
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,220
(Jumping)

1535
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:58,720
- Go!
 - Jump!

1536
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,150
Wow!

1537
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,950
That really hurts.

1538
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:04,320
It must hurt a lot.

1539
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,250
The red one.

1540
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,420
- Wow.
 - I can't jump.

1541
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,720
- It's just half.
 - Only half.

1542
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,050
(Worrying)

1543
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:15,250
I'll stop them from interrupting you.

1544
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:17,410
Please stop.

1545
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:19,420
- Ji Hyo.
 - This is the only way to stop her.

1546
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:20,720
(Wrapping her legs)

1547
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,220
What are you doing? Stop it.

1548
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:24,050
I'm not touching her.

1549
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,750
Why?

1550
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:26,950
Wait.

1551
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:29,210
Aren't they supposed to be interns?

1552
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:30,520
You're an intern.

1553
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,950
- Isn't he an intern?
 - Won Hae.

1554
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:34,890
They're not interns.

1555
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:38,620
(Hitting the xylophone)

1556
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:39,750
Please stop.

1557
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:42,530
(Won Hae protects Ji Hyo from distraction.)

1558
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,490
Chen Bolin is watching you.

1559
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,320
Really, come on.

1560
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,420
- Don't do that.
 - Who is that?

1561
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,750
- Ji Hyo.
 - Yes.

1562
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:51,150
- Chen Bolin?
 - Do you know what this is?

1563
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:53,020
- It's "National Singing Contest".
 - No.

1564
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,300
Chen Bolin

1565
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,620
- Do you like him more than Gary?
 - Chen Bolin.

1566
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:02,020
- Do you know what this is, then?
 - He's handsome.

1567
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:04,050
Ji Hyo.

1568
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:07,520
- Chen Bolin, Ji Hyo
 - Chen Bolin, Ji Hyo

1569
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,720
(Chen Bolin, Ji Hyo)

1570
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,020
Ji Hyo, Chen Bolin

1571
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:12,690
- I'm going to jump.
 - Okay.

1572
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:14,220
- I'm going.
 - Excuse me.

1573
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,620
You're supposed to be an intern.

1574
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,050
- He's resting. – He looks like my dad.

1575
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:20,200
This is not your own house.

1576
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,720
- Look.
 - Hold on.

1577
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,950
We're not...

1578
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:26,120
- at the beach.
 - He's on vacation.

1579
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,520
- What are you doing?
 - This is so funny.

1580
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,150
Oh goodness.

1581
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,050
Here I go.

1582
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:33,920
I think she'll do well.

1583
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,950
Chen Bolin is watching you.

1584
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:37,890
(Jumping)

1585
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:41,620
She jumped farther than Haha.

1586
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,520
No, she didn't.

1587
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,220
It's 1m 50cm.

1588
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,050
Seok Jin is the last player.

1589
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,150
- Guys.
 - Get ready, everybody.

1590
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:50,620
- Don't do anything.
 - It's Seok Jin's turn.

1591
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,520
Seok Jin is the last player.

1592
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:56,250
(Jae Seok brings a box.)

1593
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:58,220
What are you doing?

1594
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,120
(The members are preparing to distract Seok Jin.)

1595
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,200
- Do it together.
 - Throw them when he jumps.

1596
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,420
(The members whip Seok Jin.)

1597
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,920
(Throwing socks)

1598
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,220
(Seok Jin was distracted by the towel and socks.)

1599
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,590
Where did I land?

1600
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:12,850
- Right here.
 - No, it's here.

1601
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:14,890
- Seok Jin walked.
 - He landed over here.

1602
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,150
Now,

1603
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:21,290
- our interns will jump.
 - Let's go.

1604
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:22,750
The first player.

1605
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,720
(The first player is Hong Ryul.)

1606
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:27,590
I should aim for 2m, right?

1607
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:29,220
- Of course.
 - Sure.

1608
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,520
- Then you'll win.
 - Right.

1609
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,120
You're stepping on the line.

1610
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,050
- Look.
 - Wait a minute.

1611
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:35,520
- You're stepping on the line.
 - Please step away from the line.

1612
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,690
- Like this?
 - Yes.

1613
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:38,510
- Should I stand here?
 - Right.

1614
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:39,720
- Am I behind the line now?
 - Yes.

1615
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,320
(How far will the oldest intern jump?)

1616
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,220
- Your stomach has come out a lot.
 - It reminds me of mountains.

1617
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,520
Mountains?

1618
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,850
- You got this. You can do it.
 - Be careful.

1619
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:48,320
- Sir.
 - Sir.

1620
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,920
- He keeps...
 - You keep moving forward.

1621
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,290
- You can't do that.
 - You can't.

1622
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:53,750
- You can't step on the line.
 - You can't move forward.

1623
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:55,520
- Yes. Move back.
 - You saw that?

1624
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,210
Please don't step on the line.

1625
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:58,750
- Please, don't.
 - You saw that?

1626
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,490
- Everyone can see you.
 - But I think...

1627
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:01,850
it's not going to affect the result too much.

1628
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:03,850
(The 63-year-old Hong Ryul should be scared.)

1629
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:05,500
- Go.
 - Here we go.

1630
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,150
(Here he goes.)

1631
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:15,150
(Fly, Hong Ryul!)

1632
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,150
(He lands perfectly.)

1633
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:18,320
Bravo!

1634
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,820
He's good.

1635
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,690
He landed here too.

1636
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:23,120
(His record is 1m 70cm.)

1637
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,920
He jumped a lot.

1638
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,550
I didn't reach 2m.

1639
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:28,420
(He proves that he's still very healthy.)

1640
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,550
I'm dizzy.

1641
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:31,110
Next is Mi Sun.

1642
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:33,450
- I've never done this before.
 - You stepped on the line.

1643
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,920
Miss Park! Miss Park!

1644
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:39,420
Her body is so strange.

1645
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:42,520
(It's her first time. What will be her record?)

1646
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:45,750
It's 1m 50cm.

1647
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,220
- Wow.
 - She jumped a lot.

1648
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,620
She's better than Haha.

1649
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:49,850
She jumped 1.5m.

1650
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:51,750
(Haha is ashamed.)

1651
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:53,150
You are the best.

1652
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:55,250
Lower.

1653
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:59,420
(The third intern player is Kil Kang.)

1654
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,050
(Power jump)

1655
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:03,650
- That was awesome.
 - Are you all right?

1656
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:04,850
(Kil Kang's record is 2m.)

1657
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:06,650
He jumped far.

1658
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,820
- Here.
 - It's 2m.

1659
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,520
- It's 1.95m.
 - It's 2 metres.

1660
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,490
That hurts so much.

1661
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:12,720
It hurts a lot, doesn't it?

1662
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,150
- Who's next?
 - Go, Won Hae!

1663
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:16,120
- Just follow your gut feeling.
 - A notch higher.

1664
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,220
- Okay.
 - It just hurts once.

1665
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:19,550
Just once.

1666
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:20,950
His feet are so pale.

1667
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:22,250
(His feet are pale.)

1668
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:23,550
But really,

1669
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:25,920
his feet and hands are very pretty.

1670
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,320
(He's got the whitest feet.)

1671
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,490
He has soft and delicate feet.

1672
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:30,950
- Really.
 - How can they be so pale?

1673
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:33,120
- His feet are like hands.
 - Let me see.

1674
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,420
- His feet are like hands.
 - They are.

1675
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,690
- He's got soft and delicate feet.
 - He really does.

1676
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:37,330
(He jumps.)

1677
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:38,850
(He jumps far.)

1678
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:43,220
(Won Hae's record is 2m 10cm.)

1679
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,730
- He jumped a lot.
 - Yes!

1680
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:47,320
- He jumped a lot.
 - He took off his socks.

1681
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,420
It helps.

1682
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,950
He jumped 2m 10cm.

1683
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:52,920
He jumped really far.

1684
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,520
(The nice-looking feet is good for walking too.)

1685
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:00,550
What is he doing?

1686
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:02,520
(The fifth intern player is Yoo Yeol.)

1687
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,920
By looking at...

1688
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,220
Yeol's feet, we can know...

1689
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,150
that he has lived an easy life.

1690
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:10,120
- Yes.
 - He's got baby feet.

1691
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,950
- He must've lived an easy life.
 - The baby feet.

1692
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:14,250
- He probably stayed indoors.
 - Yes.

1693
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,420
- Seriously.
 - Look at his feet.

1694
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,120
(He jumps with a loud scream.)

1695
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:23,150
Express the pain!

1696
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:26,150
Express the pain.

1697
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:28,720
Yes.

1698
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,530
(Yoo Yeol jumps 2m 15cm.)

1699
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:33,920
He's amazing.

1700
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,950
- Everyone jumped far.
 - They are all very good.

1701
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:38,750
They all did very well.

1702
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:41,050
We shouldn't have played this indoor.

1703
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:47,120
(Rank 1 is Gary and Ahn Kil Kang.)

1704
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,550
We said we will add all the points.

1705
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:51,620
We're done playing the games now.

1706
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:55,220
The team with the most points...

1707
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:56,690
is Kim Won Hae and Song Ji Hyo.

1708
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:59,050
(Ji Hyo and Won Hae wins the training test.)

1709
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:00,450
We won!

1710
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,320
(Won Hae gets overwhelmed with joy...)

1711
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,850
(and tumbles.)

1712
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,050
(He rolls on the acupuncture pad.)

1713
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:07,890
(He's thrilled.)

1714
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:14,890
Rank 2 got 40 points. It's Jae Seok and Yoo Yeol.

1715
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,150
- Come on.
 - No ceremony?

1716
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:18,590
(Yoo Yeol also celebrates this joyful moment...)

1717
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:21,850
(by rolling on the acupuncture pad.)

1718
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:24,350
(He plants himself on the acupuncture pad.)

1719
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:28,390
- Sir...
 - Son!

1720
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:30,540
- Is your head okay?
 - Are you all right?

1721
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:31,750
Gosh.

1722
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:33,420
The next ones must be pressured.

1723
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,320
- They must be pressured.
 - Now...

1724
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,920
What will the next one do?

1725
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,950
(He's not happy.)

1726
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:40,220
Third is Gary and Kil Kang.

1727
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,690
What will Kil Kang do?

1728
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:43,020
(Rank 3 is Gary and Kil Kang.)

1729
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:44,420
(Why do these things happen to me?)

1730
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:45,550
Kil Kang.

1731
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:47,150
- Oh dear.
 - It's because of Won Hae.

1732
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:48,220
(He throws himself.)

1733
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:49,550
(And he rolls on the pad.)

1734
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:53,490
(He flies and falls on the acupuncture pad.)

1735
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:54,950
(And he suffers from the aftereffect.)

1736
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:56,120
You fell.

1737
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,620
Are you okay?

1738
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,690
Kil Kang.

1739
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:00,550
Why would you fly and fall on the pad?

1740
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:02,250
I never imagined he would fall on the pad.

1741
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:04,350
Everyone is so good.

1742
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:05,750
(The training test is over.)

1743
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:10,210
Now it's time for mentoring between the seniors and interns.

1744
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:13,490
Each team can go inside a room...

1745
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:14,850
and be comfortable.

1746
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:16,150
We'll go to the mentoring room?

1747
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:17,820
Let's go.

1748
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:18,850
(What will happen in the mentoring room?)

1749
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:22,220
(1 on 1 mentoring at Running Man Company)

1750
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,750
- It's newly painted.
 - Hong Ryul is here.

1751
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:26,050
- Hello.
 - It's here.

1752
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:27,320
- It's here.
 - Should we go in?

1753
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,850
- I will see you later then.
 - Okay.

1754
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:30,150
- Okay.
 - What's this place?

1755
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:32,520
Wait. What's this place?

1756
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,850
Wow, this is...

1757
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:35,120
(Hong Ryul cracks up.)

1758
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,850
There you are.

1759
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:38,120
Oh dear.

1760
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,750
These are your things from the past.

1761
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:40,750
Oh gosh.

1762
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:42,420
(This boy grew up to be Korea's best entertainer.)

1763
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:43,650
I'm really surprised.

1764
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:45,020
It's...

1765
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:46,650
I'm really surprised.

1766
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:48,320
When was that, Hong Ryul?

1767
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,250
I used to do a skit "Returned Ghost Wail Mountain Cabin".

1768
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:51,590
- I remember that.
 - I did that...

1769
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:53,750
in 1993.

1770
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:55,220
Right. You did it with Ha Ryong.

1771
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:56,420
Two of you did it together, right?

1772
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:59,250
- Yes. I did a play with Seong Beom.
 - Right.

1773
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:01,250
There are some pictures of me...

1774
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:04,150
- that I don't even own.
 - Look at these pictures.

1775
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:07,090
They look like recent pictures.

1776
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:08,650
This.

1777
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,420
"Small House People".

1778
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:12,390
- "Small House People".
 - "Small House People".

1779
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:13,950
You did it with Hwi Jae.

1780
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:16,250
I did a lot of shows with Hwi Jae.

1781
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:18,620
I remember you doing this with Hwi Jae.

1782
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:20,320
(The skit he did with Lee Hwi Jae was a bit hit.)

1783
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,220
Gosh, that was such a long time ago.

1784
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:26,350
Hong Ryul's history is laid out here.

1785
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:28,120
(And they bring back memories.)

1786
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,320
Wow.

1787
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,020
Right now

1788
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:35,090
I love how you look right now

1789
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:36,750
Wow.

1790
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:39,050
(They are album covers of Yoo Yeol's albums.)

1791
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:40,850
It's so new.

1792
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,950
That's what I'm talking about.

1793
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:46,250
- This was my first album.
 - I know.

1794
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:48,530
Which songs were from the first album?

1795
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:51,290
"Since the Breakup" and "Autumn Rain".

1796
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:52,750
"Since the Breakup".

1797
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:55,250
("Since the Breakup" by Yoo Yeol)

1798
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:57,300
Quiet you

1799
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:59,330
Without words

1800
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:02,830
Your appearance

1801
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:05,520
Everything remains the same

1802
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,320
That's how the song goes, right?

1803
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,650
- That's correct.
 - Right?

1804
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:12,530
- The lyrics are slightly different.
 - Right.

1805
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:14,320
- It's 90 percent right.
 - Why did they...

1806
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,290
decorate the room like this?

1807
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:18,590
I was very surprised as soon as I entered.

1808
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:19,690
What's this?

1809
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:20,750
(What is this place?)

1810
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:22,220
There are many things here.

1811
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:23,250
(Gary and Kil Kang are confused too.)

1812
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:25,200
- What's this?
 - What is this?

1813
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,890
Your movie posters are here.

1814
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:30,850
The movie we worked on together, "Dachimawa Lee" is missing.

1815
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:33,020
- I know.
 - It's too bad.

1816
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:38,020
We used to be a team.

1817
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:41,220
(The door opens.)

1818
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:45,120
(Ji Hyo and Won Hae enter their mentoring room too.)

1819
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,390
What's this?

1820
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:47,890
No way.

1821
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:51,720
(Plays, movies and posters that Won Hae appeared in)

1822
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,990
These are all the movies your starred in, right?

1823
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,630
Movies and plays.

1824
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:58,050
You did so many.

1825
01:03:58,050 --> 01:03:59,750
You shot a movie with Kwang Soo?

1826
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:02,550
Yes. We shot "My Little Hero" together.

1827
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:04,110
It failed miserably.

1828
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:05,320
Yes.

1829
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,430
It was a great movie,

1830
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:09,150
but it didn't do so well.

1831
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,420
(The hero of the doomed movie enters the room.)

1832
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:12,890
It's Solid!

1833
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:16,750
(There's a guitar and a piano.)

1834
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:18,150
It's been so long since I saw these pictures.

1835
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:19,950
(Solid's pictures are on the wall.)

1836
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:22,000
You were so young then.

1837
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,320
Of course, you are still young.

1838
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,150
It reminds me of the past.

1839
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,320
- Look.
 - Wow.

1840
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,320
- This is...
 - This is...

1841
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:33,040
- This is great.
 - This is the house of rock.

1842
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,650
Gosh.

1843
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:37,620
You are right here.

1844
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:40,750
(On the show, "Flaming Youth")

1845
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:43,050
If they have a child, this is how the child will look like.

1846
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:44,920
(The picture is photoshopped.)

1847
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,850
This is your room.

1848
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:48,950
(The room is filled with rock spirit.)

1849
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:51,020
That's Larry Carlton.

1850
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:56,150
It's a wall of all the famous guitarists.

1851
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,150
This is so great.

1852
01:04:58,150 --> 01:04:59,350
What's this?

1853
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:01,420
- Wow.
 - What's this?

1854
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:02,950
What is this?

1855
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:04,150
What's this?

1856
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,730
Wow.

1857
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:07,850
What's this? Oh dear.

1858
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:09,620
This is Mi Sun's room.

1859
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:10,750
What are all these things?

1860
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:13,050
This is crazy. So all of these are...

1861
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:15,120
- What are all these?
 - There are news articles too.

1862
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,610
- There are locks too.
 - What are those for?

1863
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:20,460
- What's this?
 - What is this room for?

1864
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:21,850
What's this?

1865
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:24,250
(The bell rings.)

1866
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:26,950
(Suddenly,)

1867
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:28,750
(they hear a mysterious bell.)

1868
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:29,850
We must be doing something.

1869
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:31,650
- It must be an announcement.
 - Yes.

1870
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:33,690
So there's really something.

1871
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:35,020
This is an announcement.

1872
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:39,050
Dear all employees and interns.

1873
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:41,750
From this moment, the final mission for the day will begin.

1874
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,750
The losing team has to pay for dinner.

1875
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:45,050
Not this again.

1876
01:05:46,490 --> 01:05:48,120
What is it? What's the mission?

1877
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:50,620
(Aren't we here to mentor them?)

1878
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:52,650
(Oh my gosh!)

1879
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:55,690
(They get locked inside!)

1880
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:57,050
Wait.

1881
01:05:57,390 --> 01:06:00,050
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1882
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:02,320
Loser has to buy dinner.

1883
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,020
What are you doing?

1884
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:06,050
Why are you locking the door all of a sudden?

1885
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:08,550
Why are you locking the door?

1886
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:10,050
Why is she locking the door?

1887
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:13,050
- What are you doing?
 - Why are you locking the door?

1888
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:14,720
Hey.

1889
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,620
They are trying to make us suspicious by locking the door.

1890
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:20,260
The final mission begins now.

1891
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:23,360
You will play roulette to decide who will treat everyone to dinner.

1892
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:26,250
Starting now, you get 60 minutes.

1893
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:29,020
You need to escape this room...

1894
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:30,590
within 60 minutes.

1895
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:32,750
You have to unlock the padlock as soon as possible...

1896
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:35,050
and escape the room.

1897
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:41,020
(The escape mission starts.)

1898
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:42,850
Hello!

1899
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:44,990
(Anyone there?)

1900
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,050
Anyone there?

1901
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,450
(Knocking)

1902
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:54,550
(He knocks quietly.)

1903
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:57,250
We are locked in. Aren't you too calm about it?

1904
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,250
- Well...
 - You have to panic.

1905
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:00,650
- Really?
 - Yes.

1906
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:01,950
Are you...

1907
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:03,950
just going to sleep here?

1908
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:05,850
- Wait.
 - Okay.

1909
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:07,820
Hey! Anyone there?

1910
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:09,550
What do I have to do?

1911
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:10,950
Your voice is too soft.

1912
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:12,050
(What will we do with him?)

1913
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:13,530
"Hey!"

1914
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,240
Oh my goodness.

1915
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,350
You won the last game.

1916
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:21,250
- Yes.
 - We'll give you a hint.

1917
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:24,050
- Great.
 - What is it?

1918
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:26,350
Do you call this a hint?

1919
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:29,320
- Are you kidding me?
 - Is this the letter "L"?

1920
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,950
(What is it?)

1921
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:33,550
- What?
 - Tell me which letter it is.

1922
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:34,950
(He's not happy.)

1923
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:38,150
(They are stuck.)

1924
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:41,120
Wait here. I'll go check the lock.

1925
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,750
(What am I doing here?)

1926
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:45,120
The lock is in alphabets.

1927
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,350
(The lock is in alphabets.)

1928
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:48,950
- What is it?
 - Look at this.

1929
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:52,740
- It's in English.
 - It is.

1930
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:54,620
It uses alphabets and a number at the end.

1931
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:56,330
- It's a number.
 - It is.

1932
01:07:56,330 --> 01:07:57,550
(They need four correct alphabets.)

1933
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:59,120
We need a hint.

1934
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,920
There must be a hint.

1935
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:03,150
Okay.

1936
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:07,500
Gosh. You shouldn't be so relaxed.

1937
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,830
We'll get out of here somehow.

1938
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:14,050
(He has a very positive outlook.)

1939
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:15,860
Let me start from the first album.

1940
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:17,250
(Let me start from the first album.)

1941
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,940
This isn't it.

1942
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:21,220
(Will he be able to escape?)

1943
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:23,750
Do we have 60 minutes?

1944
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,250
Some will...

1945
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,360
(He's anxious.)

1946
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:28,420
Some may escape before the time is up.

1947
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:31,450
(They need to find a hint.)

1948
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:32,550
There's a hint in here.

1949
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:33,950
(60 minutes to escape)

1950
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:36,050
The letters "S" and "N".

1951
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:39,520
Wait.

1952
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:43,150
I went to Samgwang Elementary School.

1953
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:45,160
Look. It says Amgwang.

1954
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:48,120
- Really?
 - It's supposed to be Samgwang.

1955
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,550
- The letter "S" is missing.
 - "S"?

1956
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:51,360
- Okay.
 - What else is missing?

1957
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,250
- It starts with S.
 - Okay.

1958
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:54,740
(They start looking for other hints.)

1959
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:57,450
- There's a CD player.
 - Let's listen to it.

1960
01:08:57,450 --> 01:08:59,350
- Play it.
 - Let's try it.

1961
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,550
Listen.

1962
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:04,240
Listen to this.

1963
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,320
What's the chord?

1964
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,250
What is it? Try again.

1965
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:10,750
Is there a metronome?

1966
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:11,860
(Is there a metronome?)

1967
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:13,250
(But that's for measuring tempo.)

1968
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:14,850
Let me see.

1969
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:16,860
- Do Kyoon.
 - Wait.

1970
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:19,860
I don't have perfect pitch.

1971
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:22,050
Try it with the guitar.

1972
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:24,050
- Try it.
 - Wait.

1973
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:25,450
It's not in tune.

1974
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:26,550
Still, you should try.

1975
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:29,350
- I found a way!
 - Okay.

1976
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,020
(There's not a lot of time.)

1977
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:34,360
(Oh gosh!)

1978
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:35,550
(What is that?)

1979
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:37,050
(It's a recorder.)

1980
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:39,220
- Why do you need that?
 - Well...

1981
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,160
- Try the guitar.
 - It's a "G".

1982
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,490
(He plays the recorder.)

1983
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:44,050
It's a "G".

1984
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:46,350
- "G"?
 - Yes.

1985
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:48,220
That's right.

1986
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:50,630
- Are you sure?
 - Yes.

1987
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:51,950
Why did they put this here?

1988
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:54,920
Why did they spell the names wrong?

1989
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,150
That's not spelled right.

1990
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,250
(They found spelling errors.)

1991
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:58,950
Both have the same alphabet wrong.

1992
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:01,550
Look at this. It is spelled incorrectly.

1993
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:03,740
They have it backward.

1994
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:06,150
This is wrong.

1995
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:07,220
(What does this mean?)

1996
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:10,250
The letters E, F, G.

1997
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:14,950
H, I, J, K...

1998
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:17,450
- It's "L"!
 - "L"?

1999
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:21,720
M, N, O.

2000
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:22,750
(Is L the hint?)

2001
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:24,550
P, Q...

2002
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,950
- Wait. Won Hae.
 - Yes.

2003
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:29,120
- Won Hae.
 - Yes?

2004
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:32,250
Let's look at it from afar.

2005
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:33,950
Look at it from here.

2006
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:35,650
Look at it from afar.

2007
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:37,820
(If you look at it from afar...)

2008
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:39,160
There's something.

2009
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:40,950
Look.

2010
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:42,350
(Look!)

2011
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:45,950
Wait a minute. It could be this.

2012
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:50,550
- There's no P.
 - Okay, zero.

2013
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:53,950
- B.
 - Blue?

2014
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:56,620
It's not blue.

2015
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:58,540
Let's see.

2016
01:10:58,540 --> 01:10:59,950
It doesn't have E.

2017
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:02,350
(Is "Blue" the passcode?)

2018
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:04,450
Green.

2019
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:05,550
(Is it green?)

2020
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:06,950
"G" for green?

2021
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:09,450
- Don't you think so?
 - Green!

2022
01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:11,220
Green. The letter "G".

2023
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:12,650
Our clothes are green.

2024
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:13,750
- We are the green team.
 - Right.

2025
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:15,660
There's a green line.

2026
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,250
(Only some things have green lines.)

2027
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:20,240
This one is green.

2028
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,750
Which one?

2029
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:23,950
This one's green too.

2030
01:11:25,450 --> 01:11:27,050
There's the letter "R"...

2031
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:30,650
- on purple things.
 - Yes.

2032
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:32,860
- We should find purple things.
 - Okay.

2033
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:34,660
- Okay.
 - Let's open this.

2034
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:36,250
What's inside?

2035
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:43,250
- Okay, here's a hint.
 - What's the hint?

2036
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:45,150
(First letter of the first prize)

2037
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:47,150
- First letter of the first prize.
 - First letter of the first prize?

2038
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:48,490
Let's find the first prize.

2039
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:49,550
(Let's find the first prize.)

2040
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:50,950
Look.

2041
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,950
It's 1970 University Song Festival's first prize.

2042
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:55,250
(1970 University Song Festival's first prize)

2043
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:58,360
(University Song Festival?)

2044
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:01,050
(Year 1986 MBC University Song Festival)

2045
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:07,220
(Yeol debuted in 1986 at the 10th University Song Festival.)

2046
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:09,950
(Could it be?)

2047
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:12,360
Who won the first prize?

2048
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:15,050
It was Lee Jung Seok. He sang "First Snow Is Falling".

2049
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:16,450
Lee starts with L.

2050
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:19,720
- It was Lee Jung Seok.
 - L.

2051
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:21,250
We have L.

2052
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:22,750
(It's L.)

2053
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,950
We have L and then...

2054
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:29,220
When is your birthday?

2055
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,360
It's August 24th.

2056
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,750
- Really?
 - Yes.

2057
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:35,150
Mine's on the 24th too. It's February 24th.

2058
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:36,450
(Really?)

2059
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:38,360
But 24 has nothing to do with this.

2060
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:41,450
(They focus on what they have in common.)

2061
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:43,360
What else? You're Kang Gary.

2062
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,150
- I'm Ahn Kil Kang.
 - We have Kang in common.

2063
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:46,620
I'm Kang.

2064
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:48,860
You're Kang Gary. I'm Ahn Kil Kang.

2065
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:52,220
(Ahn Kil Kang and...)

2066
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:54,950
(Kang Gary)

2067
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:57,250
(If the hint has to do with what they have in common,)

2068
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:58,860
(then could it be?)

2069
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:00,250
I'll try Kang.

2070
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:02,050
(I'll try Kang.)

2071
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:03,420
I'll try one by one.

2072
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,450
(It'd be nice if it was right.)

2073
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,050
(It's unlocked.)

2074
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:22,360
(He got it!)

2075
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,550
Look.

2076
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,820
We got it!

2077
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,650
(They're excited!)

2078
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:30,550
We must be stupid.

2079
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:31,860
- It's not working.
 - Why isn't it working?

2080
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:33,650
We're so stupid.

2081
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:35,860
(They pretend they didn't get it.)

2082
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:38,660
Why isn't it working?

2083
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:40,650
(They succeed in escaping!)

2084
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:42,750
Congratulations. You've escaped.

2085
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:45,450
You have to find the other team's...

2086
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:47,250
name tags and...

2087
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:49,950
put them on the intern's vest.

2088
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:52,990
The name tags have each team's Chinese zodiac.

2089
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,950
You have a greater chance of paying for the staff dinner...

2090
01:13:55,950 --> 01:13:59,360
if your name tags are on the roulette more.

2091
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,250
Quickly find the Chinese zodiac name tags.

2092
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:04,660
(The more name tags they find, the better.)

2093
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:07,550
(He is very eager.)

2094
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:11,850
I found one.

2095
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:14,050
- Did you find one?
 - Yes.

2096
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:18,490
(Kil Kang finds one.)

2097
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:20,050
It's Year of the Horse.

2098
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:21,650
- That's ours.
 - Put it on.

2099
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:23,550
(They got Seok Jin and Hong Ryul's zodiac.)

2100
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:24,950
Like this.

2101
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:29,750
Gary and Kil Kang escaped.

2102
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:33,520
Gary and Kil Kang escaped.

2103
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,850
(Already?)

2104
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:38,520
- We can do it.
 - What?

2105
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:39,850
Can we?

2106
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:41,050
- Where is it?
 - This isn't it.

2107
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:43,790
Gary and Kil Kang escaped.

2108
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:47,120
I'm sorry. We should give up.

2109
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,220
(I'm sorry. We should give up.)

2110
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:51,650
- I'm sorry.
 - It's okay. I got it.

2111
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:54,950
- Did you bring your wallet?
 - I have my company card.

2112
01:14:55,550 --> 01:14:57,050
Thank you.

2113
01:14:58,750 --> 01:14:59,950
Wait.

2114
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:01,450
(They concentrate on purple things.)

2115
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,660
- I got it!
 - What is it?

2116
01:15:06,450 --> 01:15:08,950
- It's this.
 - What is it?

2117
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:11,050
It's 106.

2118
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:14,550
The radio program I'm doing is on KBS.

2119
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:16,860
Let's take the letters "K" and "L".

2120
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:18,550
(They think it's K from KBS.)

2121
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:19,950
K and L...

2122
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:25,220
Do you think it's this? Look at the pictures.

2123
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:28,160
These are the same pictures, but...

2124
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:31,750
here you have your mouth closed.

2125
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:33,250
(Pictures without yellow borders have closed mouths.)

2126
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,750
But these ones have open mouths.

2127
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:36,150
(The yellow borders have open mouths.)

2128
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:38,360
Do you think it's...

2129
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:39,950
the alphabet "E"?

2130
01:15:39,950 --> 01:15:42,720
(Could it be the letter "E"?)

2131
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:44,330
Do you think so?

2132
01:15:44,330 --> 01:15:46,320
(Ji Hyo and Won Hae still look for hints.)

2133
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,950
Why is there a protractor?

2134
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:51,450
Do I have to look at it upside down?

2135
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:54,790
- It's the letter "D".
 - "D"?

2136
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:59,920
(Upside down, it's D.)

2137
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:03,950
- The one with red.
 - Okay.

2138
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:06,450
We have to look at the red things.

2139
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:08,950
We should focus on the red things. That one's G.

2140
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:10,250
- That's G.
 - Okay.

2141
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:12,550
- What's this?
 - It's Black Sabbath.

2142
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:14,050
- Is it Black Sabbath?
 - Yes.

2143
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:15,860
- It's Black Sabbath.
 - Okay.

2144
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:17,500
What about this?

2145
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:21,530
It's Larry Carlton and Steve Lukather.

2146
01:16:21,530 --> 01:16:24,650
- He's wearing a red T-shirt.
 - I see.

2147
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:27,740
- What about him?
 - He's Sammy Hagar.

2148
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:29,360
- I see.
 - They all have S.

2149
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,750
- They all have S.
 - That's true.

2150
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:34,660
Let's say it's S.

2151
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:37,450
- Okay.
 - Chord G and the posters are S.

2152
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:40,150
Rock and roll.

2153
01:16:40,150 --> 01:16:41,860
The "And" symbol.

2154
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:43,490
- That's in red.
 - Right.

2155
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:45,160
(Wait a minute.)

2156
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:52,050
I got it.

2157
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:53,250
Okay.

2158
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:54,550
It's singer.

2159
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:56,420
(They are both singers.)

2160
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:58,550
- I think it's singer.
 - Sing.

2161
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:00,950
Singer? Song?

2162
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:02,750
(Song?)

2163
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:04,990
- Sing?
 - Sing or song?

2164
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:09,350
(The lock is cracked open.)

2165
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,740
- What was it?
 - I got it.

2166
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:14,050
- It was sing.
 - Sing?

2167
01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:15,420
Goodness.

2168
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:16,860
I knew it.

2169
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:18,550
Sing.

2170
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:21,690
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo and Jo Han are stuck.)

2171
01:17:21,690 --> 01:17:24,450
You're the original love seeker.

2172
01:17:24,450 --> 01:17:26,320
- Haha.
 - What?

2173
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,050
- Haha, are you out?
 - Yes.

2174
01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:32,050
We need to find the name tags.

2175
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:34,660
(Will they be able to escape?)

2176
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:37,040
Let's try this.

2177
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,490
This won't open.

2178
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:39,950
(They are investigating the green video tape.)

2179
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:41,250
Wait.

2180
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:42,820
Maybe it's another one.

2181
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:45,150
Zero.

2182
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:46,950
(They found zero.)

2183
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:48,350
It's the alphabet "O".

2184
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:50,480
So, could it be "L"?

2185
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,860
"L".

2186
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:53,730
This is green too.

2187
01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:54,950
Which one?

2188
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:56,450
(The "V" in Mi Sun's photo.)

2189
01:17:56,450 --> 01:17:59,450
(O, L, V...)

2190
01:17:59,450 --> 01:18:03,110
L. O. V. E.

2191
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:04,420
(Rushing)

2192
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:06,450
What's "L"?

2193
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:08,160
- "L".
 - "O".

2194
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,820
- Zero.
 - It worked!

2195
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:12,360
Mi Sun.

2196
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,450
Goodness.

2197
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:14,750
My goodness.

2198
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:16,750
- Let's get out of here.
 - Let's go out and find it.

2199
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:17,950
- Wait.
 - My jacket.

2200
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:20,690
(After their fast escape,)

2201
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:24,020
(they are in search of the name tags.)

2202
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:26,750
(They spot Year of the Rat name tag.)

2203
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:27,820
Mi Sun.

2204
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:29,720
- Mi Sun.
 - Haha.

2205
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,050
(Please stick the name tag on me.)

2206
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:32,220
- Mi Sun.
 - Haha.

2207
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:33,750
(Please stick the name tag on me.)

2208
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:34,860
(They are a great team.)

2209
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:35,950
You should put it on.

2210
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:37,730
You should put it.

2211
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:39,050
(They are off to a great start.)

2212
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:40,550
Let's go.

2213
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:42,480
Yes!

2214
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,390
Look.

2215
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:46,290
It's there?

2216
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:47,860
Again, Year of the Rat.

2217
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:48,950
(They found another one.)

2218
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:50,540
Where should we go?

2219
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:52,450
(Is it a coincidence that they found Year of the Rat name tags?)

2220
01:18:52,450 --> 01:18:53,690
- Let's go.
 - Goodness.

2221
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:55,160
Oh, goodness.

2222
01:18:56,660 --> 01:18:58,150
CD, radio.

2223
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:59,950
(Meanwhile the Year of the Rat team is oblivious of the situation.)

2224
01:19:01,290 --> 01:19:02,660
Oh!

2225
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:04,330
It was there?

2226
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:06,050
- It's on the hat again.
 - Over here.

2227
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:08,360
It's an ant.

2228
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,150
- It's the letter "A".
 - The letter "A".

2229
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:12,430
"A" for ant.

2230
01:19:12,430 --> 01:19:14,660
Wait.

2231
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,750
- Give it to me.
 - It's L, A, K, right?

2232
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:20,950
Oh, it's "Talk".

2233
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:22,050
- What?
 - Talk.

2234
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:25,820
- Oh! T, A, L, K.
 - Yes.

2235
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:28,490
The best talk show hosts.

2236
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:30,020
T, A, L, K.

2237
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:33,310
(The lock opens.)

2238
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,660
- Goodness.
 - Let's go.

2239
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:38,720
(Jae Seok and Yoo Yeol succeed in breaking out.)

2240
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:40,550
(Seok Jin and Hong Ryul are still contemplating on their similarity.)

2241
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:42,620
- Why?
 - Wait.

2242
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:46,660
- He's got it.
 - N, O, S, E.

2243
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:49,450
- Oh!
 - N, O, S, E. Nose.

2244
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:51,050
It's nose.

2245
01:19:51,050 --> 01:19:52,450
It should be this.

2246
01:19:52,450 --> 01:19:53,690
Nose.

2247
01:19:53,690 --> 01:19:56,150
(The lock opens.)

2248
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:59,420
(Both are famous for their nose.)

2249
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:01,150
We did it!

2250
01:20:01,150 --> 01:20:02,650
- I knew you could do it.
 - You knew?

2251
01:20:02,650 --> 01:20:04,920
I knew it.

2252
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:10,750
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo and Won Hae are focusing on the film posters...)

2253
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:12,450
(within the blue borderline.)

2254
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:13,850
The blue borderline.

2255
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:17,860
Yes.

2256
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:20,550
The number of letters within the blue borderline is the same.

2257
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:25,620
It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.

2258
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:28,250
Seven? Then it's A, B, C, D, E,

2259
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:30,490
- F, G.
 - The letter "G".

2260
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:32,150
(The letter "G" is the seventh alphabet.)

2261
01:20:32,150 --> 01:20:35,150
The letters, G, L, D.

2262
01:20:35,150 --> 01:20:37,030
We found three letters already.

2263
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:38,830
The letter "G".

2264
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:41,660
G, O, L, D.

2265
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:45,050
It's gold.

2266
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:48,860
It's gold.

2267
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:51,520
How did you find that? Where was the letter "O"?

2268
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,220
- I just left it as a blank.
 - You just put it in?

2269
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:56,360
I just filled it in with a circle. And it spelled out as gold.

2270
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,220
It was really gold.

2271
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,550
(The answer was really gold.)

2272
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:02,420
You should have done it earlier.

2273
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:04,660
You could have got it sooner.

2274
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:05,950
Goodness.

2275
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:07,820
Gold.

2276
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:09,540
Let's go.

2277
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:10,750
Quickly.

2278
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:12,550
(Now, shall we go search for some name tags?)

2279
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,150
(Panting)

2280
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:16,360
Haha.

2281
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,720
(I'm so tired.)

2282
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,250
This is what we usually do.

2283
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,950
I've been up 63 flights of stairs before.

2284
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:24,820
Haha, this is killing me.

2285
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:29,720
(The number of name tags that have been found.)

2286
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:32,820
(Haha and Mi Sun have Jae Seok and Yoo Yeol's name tag.)

2287
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:36,950
(Here comes the team of the Year of the Rat.)

2288
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,690
Come stand behind me.

2289
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:41,720
Come this way.

2290
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:43,340
(Mi Sun, run away.)

2291
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:44,920
Mi Sun.

2292
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:47,860
(Jae Seok and Yoo Yeol need their Year of the Rat name tags.)

2293
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:49,250
Mi Sun, run away.

2294
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:52,190
Go after her.

2295
01:21:52,190 --> 01:21:53,520
Mi Sun, run away.

2296
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,360
- Lock the door.
 - Just get the name tags.

2297
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,160
The Year of the Rat name tags.

2298
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:02,550
(Give me the Year of the Rat name tags.)

2299
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:05,020
- We just need our name tags.
 - No.

2300
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:06,750
(He is firm not to pay for the dinner bill.)

2301
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:07,860
Mi Sun, hide it.

2302
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:10,050
Just get our name tags.

2303
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,750
(Yoo Yeol succeeds in taking the name tags.)

2304
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:13,160
Did you get it?

2305
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,450
- There was one more,
 - Yes.

2306
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:17,050
- but I couldn't do it.
 - You did well.

2307
01:22:17,050 --> 01:22:18,320
See you again.

2308
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,450
- Let's go find another.
 - Just find the others.

2309
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:23,860
All right. Let's go find another one.

2310
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:27,290
(He is quite tough.)

2311
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:30,370
(Jae Seok and Yoo Yeol are catching up with four name tags.)

2312
01:22:30,370 --> 01:22:35,420
(Meanwhile, Gary, who was the first one to break free,)

2313
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:38,830
(finds Seok Jin and Hong Ryul's Year of the Horse name tag.)

2314
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:40,830
Oh.

2315
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:42,250
It's Year of the Sheep.

2316
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:44,650
(The number of name tags that each team has currently.)

2317
01:22:44,650 --> 01:22:46,120
There's another Year of the Horse.

2318
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:47,820
There's another Year of the Horse name tag.

2319
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:51,050
- You are truly amazing.
 - We got this.

2320
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:55,750
(With seven name tags, Seok Jin and Hong Ryul are the first in line.)

2321
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:57,520
I found it. It's here.

2322
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,360
It's Year of the Chicken.

2323
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:00,750
- Year of the Chicken.
 - Yes.

2324
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:02,250
Let's go.

2325
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:04,250
Year of the Chicken.

2326
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:06,230
Isn't this it?

2327
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:07,920
It's Year of the Chicken.

2328
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,750
It's Ji Hyo.

2329
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:11,150
(Suddenly Ji Hyo and Won Hae become the first in line to pay up.)

2330
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:13,050
- Are we allowed to come in here?
 - It's all right.

2331
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:16,160
Won't we get blamed if something goes missing in this room?

2332
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:18,850
I'll go look somewhere else.

2333
01:23:18,850 --> 01:23:20,550
(He bangs his head.)

2334
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:25,450
(Dizzy)

2335
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:27,650
You should be more careful.

2336
01:23:27,650 --> 01:23:30,250
Really, you should be more careful.

2337
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:34,350
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo and Jo Han gave up and starts to sing.)

2338
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:39,050
(Time over)

2339
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:40,860
- There were none upstairs.
 - The blue ones were close together.

2340
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:42,050
- Goodness.
 - None.

2341
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:43,650
- Then.
 - Yes.

2342
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:45,150
- Jong Kook will spin the roulette.
 - Yes.

2343
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:47,450
Since I paid for the dinner last time,

2344
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:49,520
- I will spin it this time.
 - Okay.

2345
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,550
I wouldn't be chosen again, will I?

2346
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:54,320
I see that there are a few reds.

2347
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,550
Yes, but that doesn't matter.

2348
01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:58,750
- You never know.
 - Please spin it.

2349
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:00,650
Okay. I'll spin it.

2350
01:24:00,650 --> 01:24:02,250
If it lands on a white, you need to spin it again.

2351
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:03,750
All right.

2352
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:06,050
I'll spin it now.

2353
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:09,420
One. I'll spin it.

2354
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:10,860
Oh, no.

2355
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:12,920
(The wheel starts to spin.)

2356
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,720
(Please, not us.)

2357
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:17,950
The green one.

2358
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:19,450
Please.

2359
01:24:20,850 --> 01:24:22,050
Wait.

2360
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:25,660
No.

2361
01:24:26,450 --> 01:24:29,450
(It's getting closer to the red mark.)

2362
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:33,020
(No, this can't be.)

2363
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:34,920
(Stop right there.)

2364
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:39,520
(Will Jong Kook and Do Kyoon pay for dinner?)

2365
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,320
(It passed the red mark.)

2366
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,050
(Thank goodness.)

2367
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:48,850
(Though they had only three marks, it was a close one.)

2368
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:50,890
Goodness.

2369
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:53,450
That was close.

2370
01:24:53,450 --> 01:24:55,720
I'll spin it.

2371
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:59,050
(The wheel will spin until a team is chosen.)

2372
01:24:59,050 --> 01:25:00,620
I hope it's Jong Kook.

2373
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:06,550
It keeps on stopping near the red mark.

2374
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:09,540
It should stop.

2375
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:11,050
It's dangerous.

2376
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:12,420
They should have stuck the marks closer together.

2377
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:13,860
It's dangerous. Please just pass.

2378
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:15,520
It's getting nearer to the red mark.

2379
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,590
(The speed is slowing down.)

2380
01:25:18,590 --> 01:25:21,640
(Will it be Jong Kook and Do Kyoon?)

2381
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:25,390
(Or will it be another team?)

2382
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:27,250
(Who will pay for dinner?)

2383
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:46,790
(The speed is slowing down.)

2384
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:49,840
(Will it be Jong Kook and Do Kyoon?)

2385
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:53,590
(Or will it be another team?)

2386
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:55,450
(Who will pay for dinner?)

2387
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:02,080
- No!
 - Yes!

2388
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,880
- No!
 - Yes!

2389
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:10,710
(Haha and Mi Sun have been chosen.)

2390
01:26:10,710 --> 01:26:12,910
(Unbelievable!)

2391
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:22,640
(We only had three marks on the board.)

2392
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:25,940
(He who laughs last is the winner.)

2393
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:27,910
- Goodness!
 - We did it.

2394
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:30,910
(The fate of the dinner bill has been decided.)

2395
01:26:30,910 --> 01:26:36,440
(The employees and interns enjoy their time together.)

2396
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:39,010
Let's give a round of applause for Miss Park.

2397
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:41,440
(Eat up, everyone.)

2398
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:43,980
I will hand out the employee ID cards.

2399
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:45,640
- Here you go.
 - Good job.

2400
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:47,540
Mi Sun. Congratulations.

2401
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:49,510
(A golden employee ID card is given as a token of gratitude.)

2402
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:50,810
- Won Hae.
 - Thank you.

2403
01:26:50,810 --> 01:26:52,640
- Yeol.
 - Thank you.

2404
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,140
Good job. Jo Han.

2405
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:56,140
- Thank you.
 - Kil Kang.

2406
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:57,760
Thank you.

2407
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,140
Hong Ryul.

2408
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:01,140
And Do Kyoon.

2409
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:03,140
(Every intern has received a golden employee ID card.)

2410
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:04,550
One more round.

2411
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:06,710
- One more round.
 - Yes, please.

2412
01:27:06,710 --> 01:27:09,050
Thank you, Mi Sun.

2413
01:27:09,050 --> 01:27:10,550
I love you, Mi Sun.

2414
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:11,980
I love you, Haha.

2415
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:13,760
("Experience never gets old", from the movie, "The Intern")

2416
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:16,140
You have to try seven restaurants...

2417
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:18,040
within 12 hours to complete the mission.

2418
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:19,140
Everyone?

2419
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:21,740
- We have to hurry up.
 - We don't have much time.

2420

(Visiting restaurants all over the country)

2421
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:26,040
- Thank you.
 - This is delicious.

2422
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:28,240
This is my favourite restaurant.

2423
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:29,940
It's Kwang Soo's house!

2424
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:31,910
Someone is lying under the bed sheets.

2425
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:33,940
Please be careful.

2426
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:37,880
(Will they succeed in trying all seven restaurants?)
