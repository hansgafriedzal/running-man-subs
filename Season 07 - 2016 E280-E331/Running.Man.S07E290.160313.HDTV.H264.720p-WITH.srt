(Running Man in Dubai)

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,470
(Last week's episode)

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,650
Everyone, welcome to our individual travelling in Dubai.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,230
(Welcome to Individual Travelling in Dubai.)

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,480
This is Dubai.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,850
(Advanced city)

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,380
It's amazing here.

8
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,080
This is why people talk highly of Dubai.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,380
Ji Hyo, this is so nice!

10
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,580
- Isn't this so nice?
 - It's really nice.

11
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,680
This is freedom.

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,830
I love this kind of individual travelling.

13
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,280
(Running Man is in love with Dubai.)

14
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,380
Help me! Mum!

15
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,850
(Running Man is in love with Dubai.)

16
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,380
(The challenge)

17
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,370
(It was like they were having a perfect day in Dubai.)

18
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,180
This is the real desert.

19
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,280
(But of course, Running Man never gives them complete freedom.)

20
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,380
This is dangerous.

21
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,550
Some of you will sleeping outdoors in the desert.

22
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,650
(A battle of the members not to sleep outside)

23
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,750
That's insane.

24
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,180
That's so mean.

25
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,180
Wait. Not all four of us can survive.

26
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,350
Make sure you don't stray far.

27
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,850
You might die.

28
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,080
(The legend of the desert finally awakens today.)

29
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,540
Run!

30
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,080
"The Legend of Golden Grasshopper".

31
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,180
(The dangerous race in Dubai)

32
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,680
It's dangerous.

33
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,380
(Stake your all to win the dangerous race in Dubai!)

34
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,490
- Unfold it first.
 - Do we just set it up here?

35
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,380
- This place looks nice.
 - Have you ever put up a tent?

36
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,960
I have.

37
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,680
- We only have one.
 - Is this enough space?

38
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,650
- Put it in there.
 - This is large enough for us all.

39
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,850
- Is it?
 - Yes.

40
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,180
The door should be...

41
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,880
It should face the opposite direction to the wind.

42
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,780
- Where is the wind coming from?
 - It's blowing in this direction.

43
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,550
- Then we should turn it around.
 - It should be this way.

44
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,650
- Should we turn it around?
 - Yes.

45
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,820
Have you ever been in a situation like this?

46
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,780
- You might die.
 - There might be animals.

47
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,820
Will there be snakes?

48
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,980
That kind is only found in North America.

49
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,050
- You're an expert.
 - He knows a lot!

50
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,380
He's like someone from the "Discovery Channel".

51
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,280
I'm an expert at survival tactics. You should trust me.

52
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,880
- Our leader...
 - Yes.

53
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,580
is a desert expert.

54
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,580
- You see?
 - I feel safer with you.

55
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,580
- I feel reassured.
 - Should I put it in like this?

56
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,750
Wait. We should zip the tent.

57
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,950
Otherwise, the sand will go in.

58
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,580
- Wow.
 - You're amazing.

59
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,050
Leader.

60
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,480
- Yes.
 - You're so experienced.

61
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,280
Who is the desert fox?

62
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,920
- It's Yu Jae Seok.
 - It's Yu Jae Seok.

63
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,580
(Leader Jae Seok is the desert fox.)

64
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,050
(Seok Jin feels jealous because he wants to lead as the oldest here.)

65
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,450
(He wants to show off his leadership.)

66
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,680
What about here?

67
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,590
- We should put it there, too.
 - As we are four,

68
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,720
each of us should work on each corner.

69
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,070
- You should take that out.
 - I have one here.

70
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,980
Hold it tightly.

71
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,820
Why are you standing by?

72
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,920
(Jae Seok questions Seok Jin.)

73
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,280
(He squats down immediately.)

74
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,690
- It should go in here.
 - It's done.

75
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,890
Let's see.

76
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,340
It fell off again.

77
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,180
- Did it?
 - I'm not sure.

78
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,480
- It's too high.
 - It's done.

79
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,880
Isn't this too high?

80
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,380
(What?)

81
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,250
(The tent is up in the air.)

82
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,450
What happened?

83
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,650
- He put up the tent in the air.
 - My gosh.

84
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,280
- Gosh.
 - Get out of the way.

85
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,880
- Gosh.
 - I did my best.

86
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,180
This part has fallen off.

87
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,460
Then put it back in yourself.

88
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,680
(Embarrassed)

89
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,240
Now, put sand over the edges.

90
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,180
- So that it won't get blown away?
 - Exactly.

91
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,920
Have you ever lived in a desert?

92
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,080
It's nothing.

93
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,580
You sound very reassuring.

94
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,580
You sound professional.

95
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,870
It's done. It looks quite okay.

96
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,540
Normally, you're supposed to dig out ditches.

97
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,840
- Let's applaud.
 - For what?

98
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,850
We've made the place to sleep for tonight.

99
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,050
- It's complete.
 - We have to make one more of it.

100
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,350
(They still prefer to stay at the hotel.)

101
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,270
I am so happy.

102
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,880
It smells so delicious.

103
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,480
(These five are enjoying their luxurious dinner at the hotel.)

104
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,850
- It is good.
 - Right?

105
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,050
It is really delicious.

106
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,820
- I think I was too greedy.
 - How is it?

107
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,060
- It tastes good.
 - This is tasty.

108
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,850
- I didn't expect it to be.
 - It's so delicious.

109
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,280
I think we're eating six servings each.

110
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,180
Let's make sure we eat enough.

111
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,280
- We should.
 - Right.

112
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,380
- We're having a lamb party.
 - Right.

113
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,480
Try this. Just try one.

114
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,150
- It's really good.
 - Why are you being so nice?

115
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,480
- I regret for what I did.
 - What do you take me for?

116
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,050
(They had to compete for a chance to sleep at the hotel.)

117
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,580
(Gary ruthlessly defeated Ji Hyo.)

118
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,580
- I made it!
 - That's not gentle.

119
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,380
- I'll spend tomorrow just for you.
 - He's feeling guilty.

120
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,380
No, thanks.

121
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,080
- You'll see tomorrow.
 - No, I won't.

122
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,620
I'm swearing by the full moon.

123
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,490
I feel like if I make a wish by the full moon here, it will come true.

124
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,850
We must always keep the fire alive in the desert.

125
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,280
Fine, stop it now.

126
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,190
Just put them in.

127
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,620
- You're driving me crazy.
 - Just put them in.

128
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,280
You haven't been here before either. Why do you speak like a native?

129
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,080
- Gosh.
 - We all know you're not a local.

130
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,050
- We know you live in Apgujeong.
 - I just...

131
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,850
Why do you act as if you're a desert expert?

132
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,650
I have slept in the desert before.

133
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,050
- What are you talking about?
 - Sorry?

134
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,190
You must be lucky to be with me in the desert.

135
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,550
This ramyeon looks so good.

136
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,350
- Wow, we eat ramyeon in the desert.
 - It's desert ramyeon, then.

137
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,450
I'll give you some.

138
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,780
(It looks delicious.)

139
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,650
It would have been better if we had an egg too.

140
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,380
(Slurping)

141
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,230
(Chomping)

142
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,650
- It is really good.
 - I can't help but keep eating.

143
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,380
(They won't be able to eat ramyeon in desert again.)

144
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,750
It is very delicious.

145
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,480
Having ramyeon in the desert really invigorates us.

146
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,280
Yes, ramyeon in the desert is way too good.

147
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,680
I am so happy.

148
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,580
- I don't envy those at the hotel.
 - Right, I don't either.

149
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,880
- I think I chewed some sand.
 - No, there's no sand in here.

150
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,350
(They're spending a romantic night in the desert.)

151
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,980
- I'll close it.
 - Here it is.

152
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,960
- Take this out.
 - Okay.

153
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,180
There's the blanket.

154
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,050
(They look after Seok Jin and Jae Seok's tent first.)

155
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,820
- Thank you, Kwang Soo.
 - You're welcome.

156
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,950
- Good night.
 - You, too. You had a long day.

157
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,080
(Kwang Soo and Haha get ready to sleep after them.)

158
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,650
(Kwang Soo is brushing sand off his tent.)

159
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,050
Be quiet.

160
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,480
You're so mean.

161
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,020
(Seok Jin doesn't care about others as long as he's ready to sleep.)

162
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,880
You know who Seok Jin is.

163
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,070
I didn't know he was that mean.

164
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,280
You must be very tired.

165
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,750
(You must be very tired.)

166
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,450
- Good night.
 - Be quiet!

167
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,520
(Seok Jin wants them to be quiet.)

168
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,580
(What a prankster!)

169
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,750
Good night.

170
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,380
I can't believe that I'm sleeping in the middle of desert.

171
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,780
(It's too surreal for him.)

172
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:44,780
(They try to fall asleep in the dark and silent desert.)

173
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,150
(Someone is snoring.)

174
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,380
(It is Seok Jin who's breaking the silence.)

175
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,380
(Jae Seok can't sleep because of Seok Jin.)

176
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,150
(Tapping)

177
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:14,650
(Seok Jin becomes quiet for a while,)

178
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,350
(but he starts to snore again.)

179
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,050
(Kwang Soo and Haha...)

180
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,750
(are tossing and turning, finding it hard to fall asleep.)

181
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,050
(Seok Jin's snoring is so loud that the other members can't sleep.)

182
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,250
It is so cold.

183
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,850
What should I do? It is too cold here.

184
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,480
(Haha wakes up and finds it very cold.)

185
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,280
(It's a sleepless night for them because of the noise and the cold.)

186
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,970
It's so cold.

187
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,850
(This strange place is so hot during the day and cold during the night.)

188
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,640
Gosh, it is so cold.

189
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,250
It is way too cold.

190
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,950
(Haha puts the camera back in its place.)

191
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,580
I don't know what time it is now,

192
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,020
but Kwang Soo and I woke up because it's too cold here.

193
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,350
(It's too cold for them to sleep.)

194
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,950
(Will he find a way to fight the cold?)

195
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,950
I'll go back to sleep because I'm too tired.

196
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,580
(Now I bet you envy the members sleeping at the hotel.)

197
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,050
(Jong Kook is in deep sleep.)

198
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,350
(The best place to sleep)

199
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,250
(Even Gary looks handsome sleeping in the hotel.)

200
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,780
(Is Haha really not jealous of sleeping in the hotel?)

201
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,750
(The worst place for deep sleep with never-ending snoring of Seok Jin)

202
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,380
(Tapping again)

203
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,850
(Seok Jin becomes silent.)

204
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,950
(Jae Seok is relieved.)

205
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,080
(What is this sound?)

206
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,850
(It's Seok Jin's fart bomb.)

207
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,880
(He keeps farting.)

208
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,080
(What is waiting for them now?)

209
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,950
(They must be ready for anything after this.)

210
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,180
(The starry night in the desert...)

211
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,250
(is finally over.)

212
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,650
(The beautiful sun rises...)

213
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:10,480
(as it brightens the dark desert.)

214
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,950
(There might be peace again in the desert...)

215
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:23,250
(where they suffered overnight.)

216
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,480
(Jae Seok opens his eyes.)

217
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,380
(He is relieved to find himself alive.)

218
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,480
(Haha and Kwang Soo)

219
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,580
(Jae Seok walks out of the tent.)

220
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,290
- Is Seok Jin still in sleep?
 - Sorry?

221
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,380
Is Seok Jin still in sleep?

222
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,950
(Is Seok Jin still sleeping?)

223
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,590
Seok Jin snored heavily overnight.

224
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,680
Gosh.

225
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,050
(He's still half asleep.)

226
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,450
Hey, Seok Jin.

227
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,750
Wasn't it cold?

228
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,980
It was so cold,

229
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,450
but there was nothing I could do.

230
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,650
Jae Seok.

231
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,970
- I figured it out, though.
 - How?

232
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,050
I farted, and it warmed my body.

233
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,950
Seriously.

234
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,980
You snored too heavily.

235
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,980
I don't snore.

236
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,750
You should check the recorded video.

237
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,290
Check it out.

238
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,320
You drove me crazy. I thought I was sleeping with an animal.

239
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:24,950
(Animal Seok Jin)

240
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,650
(They are still tired.)

241
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,530
- Well, let's...
 - Sorry?

242
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,220
- What?
 - What are you talking about?

243
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,480
(I haven't even washed my face.)

244
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,750
- I was going to go to the restroom.
 - I just got up.

245
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,480
- We can't start anything now.
 - My bad. Go ahead.

246
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,020
- What do you think you're doing?
 - I just...

247
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,580
You should at least give us some time.

248
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,380
- There are items in the box.
 - What?

249
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,080
Us these items...

250
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,680
(They have to make use of the items in the box.)

251
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,050
(We just woke up,)

252
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,430
(and they're starting the mission right away.)

253
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,380
(What will they be using to clear the morning mission?)

254
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,380
(At the same time)

255
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,750
(The same box is provided to the members slept in the hotel.)

256
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:11,980
(What is that box for?)

257
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,280
Good morning.

258
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,280
You have to use the items in the box from now on.

259
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,280
(You have to use the items in the box from now on.)

260
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,650
You have to take morning photo-shoots.

261
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,380
(You have to take morning photo-shoots.)

262
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,750
(Take photos and bring them to me.)

263
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,880
You can decide wherever to have photo-shoot.

264
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,850
Choose the best one, and give it to us.

265
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,080
Your photo will be competing with others', and you will be given...

266
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,580
different qualities of breakfast depending on the result.

267
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,850
You may go ahead and start having your photo-shoot...

268
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,550
with one of our cameramen.

269
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,480
(They only get 15 chances to press the shutter.)

270
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,750
(He checks the items inside the box.)

271
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,150
I'll take this.

272
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,450
(He takes the sunglasses to cover his puffy eyes.)

273
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,750
I didn't expect it to be so real.

274
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,650
Let's see.

275
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,350
(What is his next item?)

276
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,450
(He takes a kettle out.)

277
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,650
(He takes a small stool, too.)

278
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,170
What are these for?

279
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,950
Please take beautiful pictures.

280
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,620
With this kettle?

281
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,680
(He will be having a photo-shoot in the desert with daily necessities.)

282
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,750
- The local drivers...
 - Yes.

283
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,840
will vote for the best photo.

284
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,880
You'll be given different kinds of breakfast depending on the results.

285
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,480
Can't you just give us for nothing?

286
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,950
Please don't do this.

287
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,480
- Why do you have to...
 - Take a look inside the box.

288
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,950
(What are the items in the box?)

289
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,850
This is just too much.

290
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,950
(Scarves, hula hoop and sunglasses)

291
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,180
What is this?

292
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,150
(Nothing useful is in the box.)

293
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,150
I heard Kwang Soo complaining about the cold last night.

294
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,850
Isn't this his head?

295
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,380
(He found Kwang Soo's head.)

296
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,750
(He has such a bad sleeping habit.)

297
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,280
I think this is his head.

298
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,180
(They pat Kwang Soo on his head.)

299
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,880
I couldn't sleep at all. It was too cold.

300
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,180
We couldn't close the tent completely.

301
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,750
All the cameras fell over.

302
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,380
- Film inside the tent.
 - It was way too cold.

303
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,850
I feel bad for them.

304
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,960
(What a disastrous footage it is!)

305
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,950
- You can sleep a bit more.
 - Right.

306
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,950
Yes, sleep more.

307
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,550
- Old man.
 - Did you call me old man?

308
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,640
You snore too much.

309
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,240
Me? Snore?

310
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,850
- You have a big nose for a reason.
 - Don't lie to me.

311
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,480
My wife told me...

312
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,450
that I sleep like a baby.

313
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,750
- That's not true.
 - She told me that.

314
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,850
- You don't sleep with her, do you?
 - Like this.

315
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,050
(Shaking)

316
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,080
If you're going to laugh, just wake up already.

317
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,950
(If you're going to laugh, just wake up already.)

318
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,680
He says he sleeps like a baby.

319
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,550
- He snored so much.
 - Right?

320
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,080
- Really?
 - Yes, it's really bad.

321
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,770
- What happened with your nose?
 - My nose?

322
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,280
Seriously.

323
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,950
- You two are so weak.
 - Right.

324
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,750
(While they are talking about what happened overnight,)

325
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,850
I'm going to have a cool photo-shoot first.

326
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,750
(The Thinker)

327
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,850
(Pressing)

328
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,080
(Wobbling)

329
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,080
(He shakes as if he's dancing.)

330
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,150
(It's hard to understand the art of photography.)

331
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,440
(Snacks for the Desert)

332
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,180
I'm going to roll down from here.

333
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,020
- Take a photo of me doing it.
 - Okay.

334
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,080
(Il Woo plans to take active photo-shoots.)

335
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,150
(Here I go.)

336
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,280
(Rolling down)

337
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,180
(He imagines himself to be like...)

338
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:37,450
(a real hero in an action movie.)

339
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,650
(It is going to be a masterpiece.)

340
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,950
I'll stop here.

341
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,250
(He's sure of himself to be depicted as a tough guy in the photo.)

342
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,750
(He's satisfied.)

343
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,280
I just can't stop myself from being cool.

344
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,280
(But the result isn't cool at all.)

345
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,870
Choose your best photo-shoot.

346
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,480
Do I choose one now?

347
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,280
Do you have any computer programme to edit photos?

348
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,880
(Do you have any computer programme to edit photos?)

349
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,580
(He's not confident of the result.)

350
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,180
This one is good. He is such a good photographer.

351
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,050
No one would notice that I took it right after waking up.

352
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,620
(No one would notice that I took it right after waking up.)

353
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,550
There are so many good ones that it's hard to choose.

354
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,050
(I'm so perfect in my eyes.)

355
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,450
I'll choose the one with the kettle.

356
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,050
(I'll choose the one with the kettle.)

357
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,050
(Snacks for the Desert is chosen to be his best photo-shoot.)

358
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,580
It's going to be like I'm drinking the sun.

359
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,150
(Jong Kook is trying to express a lion devouring the sun.)

360
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,180
It should be like the sun is seeping out from the kettle's spout.

361
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,480
It should be like I'm drinking the sun.

362
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,050
Did you get that?

363
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,450
(Drinking the Sun)

364
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,870
This is good.

365
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,450
I should leave more room between me and the kettle.

366
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,250
It's too close, right?

367
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,550
It has to look like the sun is coming out from it.

368
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,380
There should be enough space in-between.

369
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,580
It would be nice for my face to show up.

370
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,580
(Nervous)

371
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,180
(Reversed version of Drinking the Sun)

372
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,980
(Final version of Drinking the Sun)

373
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,820
This is perfect.

374
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,280
I'd like to try various photo-shoots other than that.

375
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,080
I want to ask you a personal favour.

376
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,880
I saw that in some of the photos,

377
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,050
the sun is shown much smaller than...

378
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,150
it is shown in the other pictures.

379
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,480
Could you do that again?

380
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,180
Is it possible? I think you change the exposure a bit.

381
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,050
You already used your 15 chances.

382
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,280
(It is right to refuse bad customer's request.)

383
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,650
Wait a second.

384
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:31,080
I want the image of the sun to be more solid and smaller.

385
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,850
But what's shown in the photo is too spread out.

386
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,790
I have a strong feeling to win this competition.

387
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,350
It's just incredible.

388
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,050
I...

389
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,080
(Kwang Soo starts to plan for his photo-shoot mission.)

390
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,520
Do you see the horizon in the desert?

391
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,920
It's so still and silent.

392
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,880
I'll stand there alone in solidarity...

393
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,180
while doing hula hoops.

394
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,550
(He will do hula hoops on a calm desert in solidarity.)

395
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,880
I want to express a feeling of loneliness.

396
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,940
It's going to be like a fight with myself.

397
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,380
That's out of nowhere.

398
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,070
In this vast desert,

399
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,850
the only friend I have is this hula hoop.

400
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,950
He's no wonder a dumb.

401
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,650
(He aims it to be sad, but it's funny.)

402
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,050
- Kwang Soo?
 - Yes.

403
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,050
It's called, Sorrowful Hula Hoop.

404
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,480
(Sorrowful Hula Hoop)

405
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,450
(Haha is trying to express his thirst in the desert.)

406
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,080
Focus on my desperate hand.

407
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,480
(Focus on my desperate hand.)

408
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,480
(I Have an Empty Water Bottle)

409
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,820
This will work out well.

410
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,380
(He expresses his gullible self through the flapping scarf.)

411
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,050
That looks the best so far.

412
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,350
(My Gullible Self)

413
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,750
I'll express the first footprints in the desert.

414
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,580
I want something like "Lawrence of Arabia".

415
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,750
(His footprints leave marks on a clean desert.)

416
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,180
(Sinking)

417
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,950
- Wait.
 - What are you doing?

418
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,280
- I don't see any of them.
 - It's rather like "The Himalayas".

419
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,180
- This isn't what I imagined.
 - You're not making any footprints.

420
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,950
Jae Seok, you just look like an old lady climbing Mount Bukhan.

421
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,340
Try to roll yourself down from the hill.

422
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,280
Listen, I'm going to run down here.

423
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,750
(He is about to be a free self.)

424
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,750
(Running)

425
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,050
(No one can stop me from running down.)

426
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,750
- I think it'll be nice.
 - He's like a grasshopper.

427
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,850
(Falling)

428
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,650
- He really is a grasshopper.
 - Seriously.

429
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,450
- You really are a grasshopper.
 - Really!

430
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,050
(The Fast and Furious Grasshopper)

431
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,450
This one is great.

432
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,480
(They chose their best photos.)

433
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,580
(Next model is...)

434
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,750
That's amazing.

435
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,950
(It's Gary.)

436
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,180
Isn't my face too puffy?

437
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,180
(Next model is Gary.)

438
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,080
(He doesn't want himself to look ugly.)

439
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,450
Here is your morning mission.

440
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,880
Go over there.

441
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,290
Stand where the box is.

442
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,180
Did you see the animal footprints over there?

443
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,820
(Did you see the animal footprints over there?)

444
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,850
- They must have come overnight.
 - Those are Jong Gook's.

445
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,080
It's Jong Gook's?

446
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,450
(Those are human's footprints?)

447
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,180
Those footprints weren't there yesterday.

448
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,280
(They look like animal's footprints.)

449
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,950
That's amazing.

450
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,850
I need to have at least one cool photo-shoot.

451
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,650
- I'll throw this in the air.
 - Okay.

452
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,250
(Gary wants to show something Korean.)

453
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,580
(Side kick)

454
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,920
Korean traditional style.

455
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,340
(Taekwondo Spirit)

456
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,850
How can I express this as if I'm in an oasis?

457
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,180
(She's trying to use the pool unlike the others.)

458
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,150
Well... Here I go.

459
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,380
(Her mouth is wide open.)

460
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,180
It's like my thirst is relieved after finding an oasis.

461
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,810
(My Thirst for the Oasis)

462
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,320
Here I go.

463
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,620
(Ji Hyo wants to express running person in the desert.)

464
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,150
Did you take it?

465
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,550
It's like a desert runner in the morning.

466
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,380
(Desert Runner in the Morning)

467
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,550
(Rest of the members also selected their best shots.)

468
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:56,290
(What will be the result of this competition?)

469
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,280
- Well...
 - There's a cat.

470
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,550
(Roaming)

471
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,020
We woke up at 7am.

472
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,790
Why are we having breakfast at 10am?

473
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,690
Isn't this supposed to be brunch?

474
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,450
It's a brunch in Dubai's desert.

475
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,520
Do you have seonji haejangguk?

476
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,750
No, we don't. We just closed the voting.

477
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,180
- Really?
 - Participants for the voting...

478
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,990
were 12 locals in Dubai.

479
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,180
They voted for the best one, right?

480
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,580
Yes, the results are out.

481
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,180
- The person in the first place...
 - Yes.

482
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,750
gets to have not only all the food here.

483
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,450
- What else?
 - Okay.

484
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,080
- The winner also gets a cup noodle.
 - Gosh!

485
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,680
(The winner gets to have all the dishes and a cup noodle.)

486
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,180
- I really want it.
 - No kidding.

487
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,580
- This is crazy.
 - The results are out.

488
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,020
(The second gets to have 3 dishes, the third 2 and the last 1.)

489
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,080
Show us.

490
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,550
- It's here.
 - I'm sure they did it objectively.

491
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:42,380
(Who will be the winner among four members?)

492
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,950
(Which photo would you select as the best?)

493
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,050
- Yes, it's me!
 - I knew it.

494
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,180
- Gosh, I'm in the second place.
 - Goodness.

495
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,540
- Am I the winner?
 - Don't lie.

496
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,850
Are you sure I'm in the third place?

497
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,750
Jae Seok, you can start having...

498
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,080
all of these breakfast dishes...

499
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,080
- while we boil the water for you.
 - Okay.

500
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,580
- Open these for me.
 - Okay.

501
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,950
Which one should I have?

502
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,850
- Is this edible too?
 - Those...

503
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,550
The three of those make one dish.

504
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,680
- These?
 - Yes.

505
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,950
I should eat that one.

506
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,650
- Which one?
 - I get to have only eat dish.

507
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,820
- That one looks a lot.
 - Seok Jin.

508
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,450
Move your body, and stop standing still.

509
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:15,880
I'm walking now, you jerk.

510
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,920
- These are those!
 - Jujube.

511
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,880
- Jujube!
 - It's called dates.

512
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,250
It's a speciality of Dubai.

513
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,450
- Is it good?
 - Wait.

514
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,580
(Dates are a common ingredient in the Middle East.)

515
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,850
- I've seen them at the stores.
 - Gosh, It's cold.

516
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,550
It's delicious.

517
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,650
Is it? Let me try.

518
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,050
(I want to try.)

519
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,650
You can give me one.

520
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,080
- This is...
 - I'll have that one then.

521
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,850
(He chooses the dates as his dish.)

522
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:41,980
I'll have that.

523
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,850
- This?
 - Hey, you. I'm having that one.

524
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,350
What did you say?

525
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,650
I'm the leader here.

526
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,750
- I mean...
 - Gosh!

527
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,610
- This is good.
 - I made up my mind.

528
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,920
- Which one?
 - This one.

529
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,350
- The dates?
 - Go eat them over there.

530
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,650
Why?

531
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,950
Go to the end of the table.

532
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,920
Why? I want to sit here.

533
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,180
Sit over there.

534
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,850
The shade is for us.

535
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,180
I didn't know we have our own seats.

536
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,080
You knew that. You knew.

537
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,280
(He pretended not to know about it.)

538
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,820
Who wants one?

539
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,620
Let's trade.

540
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,150
Anyone want to trade?

541
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,150
Answer him, anyone.

542
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,280
(Answer him, anyone.)

543
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,050
Kwon Ryeol, answer him.

544
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,850
- Who is he talking to?
 - Talk to him.

545
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,480
Kwon Ryeol,

546
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,320
you should be his talking buddy.

547
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,250
Desert is a lonely place.

548
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,920
He might die.

549
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,680
(Your attention might be able to save Seok Jin.)

550
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,750
I told you I'm an expert at survival tactics.

551
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,750
Can you accidentally spill two pieces here?

552
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,980
(Can you accidentally spill two pieces here?)

553
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:48,120
- That bread over there.
 - It's good.

554
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,280
- Give me one.
 - No, I don't want to.

555
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,720
(No, I don't want to.)

556
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,480
(It didn't work.)

557
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,250
I never knew a whisper could sound so cold.

558
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,320
- He asked for something I can't do.
 - Enjoy, Kwang Soo.

559
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,950
You all had your photo-shoots.

560
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,080
- Yes.
 - Now, let me announce you...

561
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,750
the result of this competition.

562
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,280
- The first place received 10 votes.
 - Really?

563
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,750
The last place didn't get any.

564
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,820
- Nothing?
 - Not a single vote?

565
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,180
- Really?
 - Are you sure?

566
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,720
The last didn't even get a vote.

567
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,950
(Jong Kook and Il Woo are the only two left.)

568
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,380
- The first place goes to...
 - Yes.

569
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,680
The first place with 10 votes goes to...

570
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,850
(Is it Jong Kook?)

571
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,950
I'm nervous.

572
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:30,850
(Or is it Il Woo?)

573
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,950
It's Jong Kook.

574
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,620
(Jong Kook wins the first place.)

575
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,850
(Oh no, I lost.)

576
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,750
Il Woo, you lost.

577
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,180
- Il Woo.
 - I knew it!

578
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,480
- You got none.
 - I knew it.

579
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,750
People know what art is.

580
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,250
They understood my work.

581
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,150
You will be given different sizes of plates.

582
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,250
- We get different plates.
 - The plate sizes are different.

583
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:54,050
(They get to enjoy the hotel breakfast with their plates.)

584
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,680
What should I eat?

585
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,150
There's so much to choose from.

586
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:01,180
(Jong Kook is relaxed with his large plate.)

587
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,050
This is amazing.

588
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,820
I'm going to stack it up as high as possible.

589
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,880
(Gary is frugal with filling his plate.)

590
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,280
Right, melon is delicious.

591
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,830
(Ji Hyo only takes the most delicious ones.)

592
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,480
(And)

593
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:20,350
(Il Woo is performing a circus with his plate.)

594
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,350
(Laughing)

595
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,880
I feel like I'm playing Jenga now.

596
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,280
My goodness.

597
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,820
(I'll be sure to show them something next time.)

598
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,150
I can smell it.

599
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,280
- Only the winner gets that noodle.
 - Gosh.

600
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,280
You look sexy with the moustache.

601
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,720
(You look sexy with the moustache.)

602
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,450
(That's nice of you to say.)

603
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,850
(Slurping)

604
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,580
(The power of compliments)

605
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,480
Your moustache grows like...

606
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,480
that of a European man.

607
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,950
(Pass)

608
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,450
I feel so much better.

609
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,680
Since when were you so masculine?

610
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,480
Look at your arms.

611
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,850
(Since when were you so masculine? Look at your arms.)

612
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,850
You look sexy, Jae Seok.

613
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,050
(Whatever)

614
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,680
Kwon Ryeol, answer back.

615
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,150
(Kwon Ryeol, answer back.)

616
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,580
Can I taste a sip of the soup?

617
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,970
(Can I taste a sip of the soup?)

618
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,180
What?

619
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,850
- Are you talking to yourself?
 - Wait.

620
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,280
- Are you talking to yourself?
 - Am I...

621
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,380
- hearing things?
 - I know.

622
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,150
- It's so hot.
 - What is going on?

623
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,850
Yes, you're hearing things.

624
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,250
(Seok Jin, are you ill from the heat?)

625
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,850
(The hot sun is beating down nonstop.)

626
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:38,450
(Gosh, when will they come?)

627
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,580
- Isn't it just too hot?
 - It's seriously...

628
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,750
(What is that?)

629
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,850
The lucky ones are coming.

630
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,480
- They're so far away.
 - They will definitely laugh at us.

631
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,350
They'll ask if we slept here, and we'll say of course.

632
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,650
- They're here. They look so clean.
 - Look at them.

633
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,850
They're from the city.

634
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,080
Look at them.

635
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,080
- Really.
 - The celebrities are coming.

636
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,820
- It's the stars.
 - They look so clean.

637
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,380
- Really.
 - Are you all right?

638
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,950
- They look so lively.
 - Are you all right?

639
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,610
- Look.
 - Do you think we're all right?

640
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,820
- You lively people.
 - They dressed up for the desert.

641
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,440
Are you here for a photo?

642
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,650
- I'm sorry.
 - Are you here for a photo?

643
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,280
- Hello.
 - Are you all right?

644
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,750
Gary, did you sleep with us last night?

645
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,450
- Why didn't you dress up?
 - No.

646
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,480
I did. Doesn't it show?

647
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,680
(He is a very modest man.)

648
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,550
- It is very cool under here.
 - You guys smell so nice.

649
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,680
It's very cool in the shade.

650
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,710
- What?
 - Why that little...

651
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,480
- What should I do about him?
 - Why don't you stay the night here?

652
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,580
It's nice here.

653
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,780
- Stay here then.
 - No, it's fine.

654
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,180
I thought my back was going to snap.

655
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,980
Because I curled up my body while sleeping.

656
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,550
It was too cold.

657
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,050
Why didn't you turn the heater on before you went to sleep?

658
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,050
- Where?
 - That little...

659
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,280
- Hey, you!
 - Where is the heater here?

660
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,550
I really wish I was good at fighting.

661
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,250
My goodness.

662
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,950
- What are we going to do now?
 - You must have had a tough night.

663
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,050
- Oh, my.
 - What is this?

664
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,630
It's a mission.

665
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,680
- Look at them throwing things.
 - Is this how they give missions?

666
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,280
- I was surprised, too.
 - What is it?

667
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,850
"The Legend of the Golden Grasshopper"

668
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:07,840
Long time ago, the Golden Grasshopper was guarding Dubai.

669
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,280
(The legendary Golden Grasshopper?)

670
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,850
- I knew it.
 - It's treasure hunting, right?

671
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,250
(Today's mission is to find the legendary treasure.)

672
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,050
"The Legend of the Golden Grasshopper".

673
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,180
("The Legend of the Golden Grasshopper")

674
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,850
Long time ago, the Golden Grasshopper was guarding Dubai.

675
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,180
But as the time passed by, the Golden Grasshopper became forgotten,

676
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,950
and it suddenly disappeared without a trace.

677
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,950
(It became forgotten and suddenly disappeared without a trace.)

678
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,680
Many went on the search for Golden Grasshopper...

679
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,850
and found that Golden Grasshopper had turned into stone.

680
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:38,950
(Many went on the search for the Golden Grasshopper around Dubai,)

681
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:44,350
(but they only found the Golden Grasshopper turned into a rock.)

682
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:49,820
(Hundreds of years passed by.)

683
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,480
(Hundreds of years passed by. And in the year 2016,)

684
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,580
(the nine members of Running Man starts to search for it.)

685
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:03,750
("Hourglass Race")

686
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:09,180
(The nine members...)

687
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,850
(share the hourglasses representing their lives.)

688
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:13,980
Let's go.

689
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,180
Be careful. He's too fast.

690
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,650
(They will be divided into three teams to scour Dubai.)

691
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,450
(It is their first time in seeing the real Dubai,)

692
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,750
(the mystical and secretive city.)

693
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,080
Isn't that it?

694
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,380
(There is the one thing that they should never forget.)

695
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,750
I'm alive.

696
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,650
This is confusing.

697
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,550
(They have to turn over the hourglass to keep themselves alive.)

698
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,280
Did you find it? What is that?

699
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,080
Seok Jin. Seok Jin.

700
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,280
- Take it off.
 - You shouldn't do that.

701
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,070
- Catch him.
 - It's dangerous.

702
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:41,750
(Who will restore the Golden Grasshopper back to life?)

703
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:47,750
(Before they go on the search, they will split up into teams.)

704
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,750
(The teams have been formed.)

705
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,180
(They will turn over the hourglass before they go on the search.)

706
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,420
- Okay.
 - Yes.

707
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,180
- In 1, 2 and 3.
 - And 3.

708
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,250
My life depends on this.

709
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,280
- You can't touch the others'.
 - Okay.

710
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,550
We will play only one game.

711
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,580
We will play a three person kickball.

712
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,380
(Winner gets a second chance when their hourglass runs out of time.)

713
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,850
You first roll the ball from the blue spot.

714
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,850
And another person kicks the ball from the right over there.

715
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:16,540
The right side is the first base. The second base is on the left.

716
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,950
You get a point when you return to home.

717
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,950
- Oh, I see.
 - I haven't played this in a while.

718
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,480
- Which team is doing the defence?
 - Let's do this.

719
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,680
- We're offense.
 - Okay.

720
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,780
Is that so?

721
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,850
(Gary is the first batter.)

722
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,280
- Let's go.
 - Good luck.

723
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,840
(Il Woo is the starting pitcher.)

724
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,050
(He looks like an expert.)

725
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,950
- You're out if it's three strikes.
 - Il Woo, show us breaking ball.

726
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,080
- Go, Gary.
 - He is a fast runner.

727
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,380
Il Woo, you have a great posture.

728
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,680
- It's too close.
 - It looks like...

729
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,850
(Stumbling)

730
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,580
Goodness, Il Woo.

731
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,060
- He's faking it.
 - You look great.

732
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,820
(He concentrates again and throws the ball.)

733
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,580
(Come to me, ball.)

734
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,580
(Kicking)

735
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,650
(It struck perfectly.)

736
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,820
Over here.

737
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,850
(Il Woo caught it at once.)

738
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,080
- Wait.
 - Over here.

739
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,620
(He throws to Seok Jin on first base.)

740
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,250
(Gary is running at full speed on bare foot.)

741
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,950
(There may be blue...)

742
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,550
(and better blue.)

743
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,650
Are you serious?

744
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,950
- Over here.
 - Throw it.

745
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,280
(He throws it to the ground.)

746
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,950
- What was that?
 - What was that?

747
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,580
- What are you doing?
 - What are you doing?

748
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,850
- What is that?
 - This was to get him out.

749
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,380
- What were you doing?
 - You looked as if...

750
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,950
you were a professional kickball player.

751
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,450
- We had to get this one out.
 - Gosh.

752
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,580
Kwang Soo.

753
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,620
(Maybe I'm ill from the heat of the desert.)

754
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,450
- Good luck.
 - Yes.

755
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,870
(I'll make it this time.)

756
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,680
- Show us a breaking ball.
 - Please.

757
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,050
- Wait.
 - Strike.

758
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,850
(What?)

759
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:37,950
(Did he make a high-five with a ball?)

760
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,950
- Strike.
 - Is that a strike?

761
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,050
Why are you doing this to me?

762
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,280
- Strike.
 - Why are you doing this to me?

763
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,980
You shouldn't touch it.

764
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,080
- It's hot.
 - Yellow card.

765
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,680
One strike.

766
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,950
I'll tell you.

767
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,080
- Okay.
 - I'll tell you.

768
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,580
(I will kick you.)

769
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,650
One strike.

770
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,180
(The weather is hot, and he's angry.)

771
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,480
- It's two strikes.
 - Il Woo!

772
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,080
Il Woo, it's two strikes.

773
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,550
- Strike him out.
 - It's two strikes.

774
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,280
I've never seen a strike out in kickball games.

775
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,850
Wait a minute.

776
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:09,180
- I've never seen one.
 - Wait.

777
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,050
He worries me.

778
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,680
If he misses it again,

779
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,580
(I will get you out.)

780
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,640
(I can't get out.)

781
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,350
There's no way of missing this.

782
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:25,150
(Will he kick it?)

783
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,950
(Kicking)

784
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,680
- Catch it.
 - Stay there!

785
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,750
(The ball flew high up in the sky, and he catches it.)

786
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,950
- Okay.
 - Great.

787
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,980
(Il Woo catches it.)

788
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,750
What's wrong with you?

789
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,820
It's all right.

790
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,820
I kicked with my left foot.

791
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,590
I hurt my pride.

792
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,230
One out.

793
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,050
- Let's not give them any point.
 - Ji Hyo, I'll tell you.

794
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,480
- Okay.
 - If I tell you to run, run.

795
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,180
(Gary and Kwang Soo are changing positions.)

796
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,750
Il Woo is doing great.

797
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,680
Il Woo is amazing.

798
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,050
(Gary kicks the ball.)

799
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,280
(The ball heads straight to Il Woo.)

800
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,050
(Will Gary be put out?)

801
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,280
(What?)

802
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,480
- Run!
 - He missed it!

803
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,480
- Oh, no. Il Woo.
 - Il Woo.

804
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,680
- Here.
 - Ji Hyo, run.

805
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,850
Ji Hyo.

806
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:08,080
(Ji Hyo runs to the second base.)

807
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,580
(Jae Seok throws the ball to second base.)

808
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:14,350
(It is the ball versus Ji Hyo.)

809
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:18,550
- Ji Hyo is out.
 - Safe.

810
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,280
(Jong Kook missed the ball, so she is safe.)

811
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,580
- It's safe.
 - Oh, my.

812
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,850
- You had to get her out.
 - You should have caught the ball.

813
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,080
It's safe.

814
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,280
You need to catch it.

815
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,680
Ji Hyo, you go.

816
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,180
Change. You kick.

817
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,820
- Should I kick?
 - Yes. Kwang Soo come here.

818
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,850
Il Woo, you can't miss the ball again.

819
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:36,080
- Okay.
 - I've never seen him like this.

820
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,950
- Do you want to be out of the game?
 - Form a tight defence.

821
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,220
- Da Hey, focus
 - Did they score one point?

822
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,150
- It's so hot here.
 - Da Hey, come to the front.

823
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,850
Wait.

824
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:47,440
- Run.
 - Get the ball.

825
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,180
- Oh, my.
 - Here.

826
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,180
- Run.
 - Catch it.

827
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,450
Okay.

828
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,850
(Slow)

829
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,080
- Catch it.
 - Run.

830
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,820
- What are you doing?
 - What are you doing?

831
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,080
- Run.
 - Quickly.

832
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,980
Run.

833
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,580
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo has reached the second base.)

834
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,850
(She slides and touches the second base.)

835
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,780
- Gary.
 - One point.

836
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,580
Two points.

837
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,280
It's not that he can't. It's just that he won't.

838
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,380
This is...

839
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,180
- Why did you throw it?
 - I threw it, so you could catch it.

840
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,680
Why did you throw it?

841
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,080
- You should have caught it.
 - Why did you throw it at me?

842
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,180
I thought if I don't catch it,

843
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,580
- the game pauses.
 - This is like baseball.

844
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,950
- Wait.
 - I got it.

845
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,380
I thought it was a stone but it was poop.

846
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,180
Poop is everywhere.

847
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,480
Why is there so much poop?

848
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,780
(The ground is covered with poop.)

849
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,810
I thought it was a stone but it was poop.

850
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,080
Are you sure it's not yours?

851
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,280
Mine doesn't look like this.

852
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,980
- Gosh.
 - You said you're constipated.

853
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,480
(Please stop talking about poop.)

854
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,650
(It's sizzling hot in the desert,)

855
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,350
(but no one would give up the second chance.)

856
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,750
Gosh, this is...

857
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,480
(He kicks the ball.)

858
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,780
(Gary hit a home run.)

859
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,320
Run!

860
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,170
- Gosh.
 - Run!

861
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,860
- Run!
 - Run!

862
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,390
Gary was standing too close.

863
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,580
(They scored two additional points.)

864
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:14,020
(Team Kwang Soo has scored five points so far.)

865
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,280
It was a home run!

866
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,480
Il Woo, you let them score five points.

867
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:20,190
Four of them were by you.

868
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,380
We have only one out left.

869
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,390
(Ji Hyo is waiting to kick the ball.)

870
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:26,480
This might be a chance.

871
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,480
- Nice. Run!
 - Run!

872
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,080
- Hurry!
 - Run!

873
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,950
- Run!
 - Throw the ball!

874
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,780
Hurry!

875
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,280
- Ji Hyo is out.
 - Out.

876
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,840
Gosh.

877
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,280
Out.

878
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,480
Il Woo is no better than me.

879
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,680
(Team Kwang Soo has scored five points.)

880
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,080
He jumped just like me!

881
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,020
(Meanwhile, the sand in the hourglasses keep flowing down.)

882
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,280
Is it our turn?

883
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,480
I'll show you something amazing.

884
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,780
Throw it gently.

885
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,890
(Seok Jin pitches for the first time.)

886
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,870
- Gosh.
 - Run to the first base!

887
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,180
Here!

888
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,480
(Haha...)

889
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,380
(made it to the first base in time.)

890
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,370
- Gosh.
 - Stay there.

891
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:06,390
(Team Jong Kook is the dream team.)

892
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,780
Hey!

893
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,690
Look at him.

894
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,480
- Gosh.
 - Why?

895
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,580
It's okay.

896
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,680
(They scored nine points quickly.)

897
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,740
(Seok Jin and Jae Seok switches positions.)

898
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,670
If they score one more point, it'll be over.

899
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,180
(When one team has 10 more points than the other,)

900
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,480
(the umpire can end the game.)

901
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,650
Gosh.

902
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,650
(Jae Seok throws the ball.)

903
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,050
Oh, my.

904
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,080
(Il Woo missed the ball.)

905
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,150
That was unbelievable.

906
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,380
(What just happened?)

907
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,690
As we're far behind,

908
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,580
I'll make it really difficult.

909
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:46,150
(Jae Seok is determined.)

910
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,880
(Flying)

911
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,080
- I'm sorry.
 - What did he do?

912
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,780
Il Woo is terrible.

913
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,150
(Il Woo keeps making mistakes.)

914
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:00,390
(I'm not allowing you the second chance.)

915
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:03,080
(We'll make it a called game.)

916
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:09,080
(Aim for the target.)

917
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,880
- Three strikes.
 - Out.

918
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,480
(Il Woo missed the ball again.)

919
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,480
- Three strikes.
 - I didn't know it's possible.

920
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,440
Il Woo.

921
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,470
You should go on the Guinness World Records.

922
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,350
Get in touch with them.

923
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,580
Three strikes.

924
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,580
We'll remember it even if you win.

925
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,560
Even if your team beats us 100 to 0,

926
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,830
we'll never forget this.

927
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,080
I feel sorry for him.

928
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,580
(Sadly, that's true.)

929
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,950
(Team Haha has 9 points with 1 out.)

930
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,280
- No, don't.
 - Gosh.

931
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,390
I said, don't.

932
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,680
- To the first base!
 - To the first base!

933
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,680
To the first base!

934
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,080
Seok Jin!

935
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,180
(Because of Seok Jin, Il Woo reached home.)

936
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,380
- Why didn't you catch the ball?
 - Too bad.

937
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,280
(With Team Haha scoring 10 points, the game ended.)

938
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,950
What's the score?

939
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,480
It's 10 points.

940
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,150
We won.

941
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,190
Seok Jin let them score so much.

942
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,980
(Team Haha won the kickball.)

943
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:06,680
Team Haha gets two second chances.

944
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,190
Nice!

945
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,880
- Team Kwang Soo gets one.
 - Nice!

946
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,890
- I didn't know we'd get one.
 - Is this for us?

947
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:16,980
Team Jae Seok gets none.

948
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,580
- Okay.
 - We didn't want it anyway.

949
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,750
(Team Jae Seok gets no second chance.)

950
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,370
- You get none.
 - I'm sick of this.

951
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,580
- We're chased all the time.
 - Send us somewhere else.

952
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,150
- I'm sick of this.
 - Send us somewhere else.

953
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,890
We were not expecting to get any second chance.

954
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,080
- Gosh.
 - Let us go.

955
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,980
We don't want any second chance.

956
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:35,190
We're done with our tasks in the desert.

957
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:38,250
- Finally.
 - Let's move.

958
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,880
We're finally leaving the desert.

959
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:47,880
(What will be waiting for them in their next destination?)

960
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,020
It's downtown.

961
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,650
It must be some kind of market.

962
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,690
I want to look around here.

963
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,580
We're here. Let's get off here.

964
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,880
- Okay.
 - We should get off.

965
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,280
(Team Jae Seok arrived at the destination first.)

966
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,080
- Thank you.
 - You're welcome.

967
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,950
(We're happy as long as we're not in the desert.)

968
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,890
(Where are they?)

969
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,390
I have sand in my shoes.

970
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,080
(Souk is a traditional market divided in three sections.)

971
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,890
- This must be a traditional market.
 - Wow.

972
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:21,390
(It consists of Gold Souk, Textile Souk and Spice Souk.

973
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,180
Do we have time for shopping?

974
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,680
- I guess we don't.
 - We don't.

975
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,780
- I'm happy we're not in the desert.
 - This place looks exciting.

976
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,780
- It's nice.
 - I love markets.

977
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,270
Right?

978
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,980
Are we getting on a ferry?

979
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,580
Are we?

980
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,320
- It's a water taxi.
 - Wow.

981
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,750
(Getting on a ferry makes them excited.)

982
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,380
Dubai is so nice.

983
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:44,670
This is so romantic. I want to come back here with my girlfriend.

984
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,020
It's so nice.

985
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,050
(They're happy to be on the water...)

986
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:51,390
(instead of in a desert.)

987
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,780
It's nice.

988
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,280
Isn't that a bus?

989
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,750
(Is this a recycled bus?)

990
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,660
It has wheels.

991
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:02,390
- What if it sinks?
 - I wish I could take pictures.

992
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,480
Is that really a bus?

993
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,580
That ferry looks amazing.

994
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,180
(A buffet ferry)

995
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,180
It has a buffet in it.

996
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,480
Look at that. I wish I could take pictures.

997
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,680
(After a pleasant ferry ride,)

998
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,890
(they arrived at their next destination.)

999
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,580
Is that a fishing boat?

1000
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,850
That boat is so tall.

1001
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:24,690
(What mission will be waiting for them here?)

1002
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:26,980
- What could this be?
 - It looks like a fishing boat.

1003
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,180
(They arrived at an exotic dock.)

1004
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,690
They've been waiting for us.

1005
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,890
What is this?

1006
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:35,080
Please open the parchment and read it.

1007
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,680
And put down your hourglasses on the carpet.

1008
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,050
Let's read the mission first.

1009
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,080
After leaving the desolate desert, they arrived...

1010
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,880
at a market where people sell gold, spices and textiles.

1011
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,180
When they split up into three groups and found the hidden answers,

1012
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:50,190
another legend regarding the stoned grasshopper revealed.

1013
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,750
- Finally.
 - Escape from the desert.

1014
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,820
You arrived...

1015
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,080
at Souk, the traditional market in Dubai.

1016
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,750
- I see.
 - Souk?

1017
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,550
The markets are on the both sides of the river.

1018
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,800
Three people from each group...

1019
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,380
will look for the answer in each market.

1020
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,880
When all three members have found the answers, the team can leave.

1021
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,390
You cannot leave this place until all members are finished.

1022
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:19,080
- Decide who will go to which.
 - I want to go to the gold market.

1023
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,280
- Where should I go?
 - Where should I go?

1024
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,950
I'd like to...

1025
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,950
- I'll go to the gold market.
 - I want to go there.

1026
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,180
- Let me go to the gold market.
 - I'll go.

1027
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,050
I'll go to the gold market.

1028
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,050
Jong Kook is going to the gold market.

1029
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:31,880
(Is that so?)

1030
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,480
- I'll go to the spice market.
 - Let me go there.

1031
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,150
(Avoiding Jong Kook is his priority.)

1032
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,580
- I want to go to the spice market.
 - I'll go there.

1033
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,950
- You wanted the gold market.
 - Just go to the gold market.

1034
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,280
- I'm disappointed in you.
 - I...

1035
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,080
Let me go to the spice market.

1036
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,580
- I'll go to the spice market.
 - Okay.

1037
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:48,180
The ones going to the gold market, please step forward.

1038
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,280
- Okay.
 - The gold market.

1039
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,050
You should see the gold from Dubai.

1040
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,890
We should see the gold from Dubai.

1041
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,580
- I'm worried.
 - Each has a different question.

1042
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,650
Please read yours starting from Jong Kook.

1043
00:40:58,650 --> 00:40:59,780
- Do we have different questions?
 - Yes.

1044
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,280
Are they different?

1045
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,050
"A leaf with glowing-red veins...

1046
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,080
climbs up the wrist and meets another."

1047
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,480
- What does this mean?
 - Are we supposed to find this?

1048
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,750
Mine seems easy.

1049
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:13,390
"A necklace with two peacocks under a bloomed lotus."

1050
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,480
- That's easy.
 - This one is easy.

1051
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,050
He should look for a necklace that looks like peacocks.

1052
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:19,540
"A necklace that has one great moon with five jewels..."

1053
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:23,650
"and nine moons with three jewels."

1054
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:26,390
- That sounds hard.
 - Five of what?

1055
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,750
One great moon with five jewels.

1056
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,180
Isn't that squid?

1057
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,520
I think your answer is squid.

1058
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,390
- Find a squid-looking necklace.
 - Please change it to six.

1059
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:36,190
Squids have 12 legs

1060
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:39,580
You're to take a picture of the described item.

1061
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,890
- Take a picture?
 - Okay.

1062
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:44,190
You should finish before all the sand flows out.

1063
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,190
Then should we go back and forth?

1064
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:48,050
You can head to the gold market right now.

1065
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,080
- Okay.
 - Where is it?

1066
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,970
Let's hurry.

1067
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,580
Is it far from here?

1068
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,480
Really? What should I do with the hourglass?

1069
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:00,780
Then should I go back and turn the hourglass around?

1070
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,750
(They're worried about their hourglasses.)

1071
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,750
Look at that.

1072
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,390
(Wow! It's gold everywhere!)

1073
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:10,580
This is amazing.

1074
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,950
So this is the gold market.

1075
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,380
There's so much gold.

1076
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,060
Look at all these.

1077
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,690
It must be here.

1078
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,950
Oh, it's here.

1079
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:25,190
(What does the gold market in Dubai look like?)

1080
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:29,250
There's gold everywhere.

1081
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,580
Wait.

1082
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:33,390
There are so many golden items. I don't know where to start.

1083
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:35,480
(Gold Souk is the biggest gold market in the Middle East,)

1084
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,580
(and 10 percent of gold transactions in the world take place in here.)

1085
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,070
Look at this.

1086
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,950
This is unbelievable.

1087
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,150
How much would that cost?

1088
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,380
Look at this golden football shoe.

1089
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,280
This is amazing.

1090
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,650
(A golden shoe and a golden ball)

1091
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,980
Look at this.

1092
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,690
(You can find everything in gold.)

1093
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,790
(Bling-bling)

1094
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:00,190
Look at this. It reminds me of Cleopatra.

1095
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,280
It's amazing.

1096
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,960
How could anyone wear this around?

1097
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,580
I feel like I'm mesmerised.

1098
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,680
(They're mesmerised by gold.)

1099
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,950
I can't think of anything.

1100
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:10,580
I want to buy them.

1101
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,580
- Textile Souk is across the river.
 - Textile Souk.

1102
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,680
- Oh, my.
 - Really?

1103
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,890
- Kwang Soo, sorry.
 - Find the answer there.

1104
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:22,180
We'll tell you names of the stores and items you should buy.

1105
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,780
- Buy it with the money we gave you.
 - We have to go buy it.

1106
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,980
We'll tell you just once, so listen carefully.

1107
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,450
- I'm not good at this.
 - The names of the owners and items.

1108
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,080
- We're starting from you, Da Hey.
 - Okay.

1109
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,450
"Buy Pel Bunapssaji from...

1110
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,580
Assan Amin's store."

1111
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:41,480
("Buy Pel Bunapssaji from Assan Amin's store.")

1112
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,180
Assan Amel?

1113
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,650
Phen Bunapssaje?

1114
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:47,150
An...

1115
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:50,380
- Da Hey.
 - Assam Anel and Phen Bunapssaje?

1116
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,280
It's Assan Abel's store.

1117
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,280
Gosh! I am so confused.

1118
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,280
It's Assan Amel and Phe...

1119
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,480
Phe bunapssaje.

1120
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,680
"Buy Warud Tattris...

1121
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,650
from Parkashu Mulani's store."

1122
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:04,280
("Buy Warud Tattris from Parkashy Mulani's store.")

1123
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,480
- Let's go.
 - Warussa...

1124
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,820
- Phen Bunapssaje?
 - Was it Parkashua?

1125
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,950
Parkshua Tamil.

1126
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:12,750
- Parkshua Tamil.
 - Parkshua Tamil.

1127
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,750
"Buy Nal Asuwad...

1128
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,480
from Kakairela's store."

1129
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,280
- Kakailla and Nal Asuwal.
 - Way to Go! Il Woo.

1130
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,550
- Go!
 - Nal Assuwal?

1131
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:22,820
- Nal Asuward.
 - Kakaila.

1132
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:27,480
It's Assan Abel and Pel Bunapssaje.

1133
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,880
(They're repeating the words to memorise them.)

1134
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,380
Nal Assuward. Nal Assuward.

1135
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:35,380
(He continues to memorise the word.)

1136
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,930
Nal Assuward.

1137
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:39,380
(He concentrates on memorising the Arabic words.)

1138
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,280
Gosh, I forgot to flip my hourglass.

1139
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,920
- What?
 - I forgot to turn it around.

1140
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,650
You have to come back again then.

1141
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:51,670
(There's not much sand left to go down in Kwang Soo's hourglass)

1142
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:53,780
(He has to complete his mission as soon as possible.)

1143
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,450
What do you have to buy, Il Woo?

1144
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:56,880
(He looks at something.)

1145
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,680
- Assan Abel...
 - I should go to Parshadame's store.

1146
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,650
- Wait. He wrote it down.
 - Warud...

1147
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,060
He wrote it down by using his sunglasses and nails.

1148
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,980
- No, I didn't.
 - He wrote it down with his nails.

1149
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:12,150
(Before taking the abra ride)

1150
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,880
Warkaradame.

1151
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,780
(Il Woo writes it down to regain his honour.)

1152
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:18,980
What was that?

1153
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,780
It's cheating!

1154
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,580
- I didn't write it down.
 - He wrote it down with his nails.

1155
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:24,680
No way.

1156
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,480
(Kwang Soo scratches Il Woo's envelope with his nails.)

1157
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,680
Let's switch our envelopes.

1158
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,880
- Come on!
 - Kakarela. Kakarela.

1159
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,780
- Kakarela.
 - Isn't it cheating?

1160
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,480
He unashamedly looked at it.

1161
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,850
(Who will be able to buy the item first?)

1162
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:40,850
- It's our turn now.
 - Last one is Spice Souk.

1163
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:44,750
We'll make each of you try different spices...

1164
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,880
without actually seeing it.

1165
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,080
- Are we tasting it?
 - Yes.

1166
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,680
(Spice number three)

1167
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,080
Gosh.

1168
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,970
Remember the taste and smell of the spice in your mouth...

1169
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,280
- and buy it.
 - Gosh!

1170
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,480
(They're trying hard to taste the spice.)

1171
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,680
(What is this?)

1172
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,430
What's this?

1173
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:01,280
(Oh my goodness!)

1174
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,820
You can take off your eye patches and leave now.)

1175
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,980
(Let's go to find the spices!)

1176
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,380
We will give you money for this mission.

1177
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,580
Buy just one gram of each spice.

1178
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,680
- How many grams?
 - Just one gram.

1179
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,850
- That's the smallest amount...
 - Gosh.

1180
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:11,880
What is this taste?

1181
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,380
(She's shocked by the taste.)

1182
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,980
Where is the spice market?

1183
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,180
How does it taste?

1184
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,680
- It's sour.
 - Is it sour?

1185
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,180
It is too spicy.

1186
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,980
It is so hot.

1187
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,480
- Is it hot?
 - It is very hot.

1188
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,850
My spice tastes a bit weird.

1189
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:34,150
- Gosh!
 - It tastes strange.

1190
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:38,780
(Jae Seok is experiencing the spiciness of Dubai.)

1191
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,450
I don't think Jae Seok can go to the market. He's lost his control.

1192
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:45,850
- Goodness.
 - Is it that hot?

1193
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:47,520
Does anybody have water to drink?

1194
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,950
I need to buy a bottle of water first.

1195
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:52,080
(Jae Seok buys a bottle of water to wash off the taste in his mouth.)

1196
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:56,380
It's so hot.

1197
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,880
I think this one is the one.

1198
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,440
Hi, how are you?

1199
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,650
What is that?

1200
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,980
- It's chili, and it's very hot.
 - Is it very hot?

1201
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,850
(Is it very hot?)

1202
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:07,150
What if this is spicy, too?

1203
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:08,280
(Jae Seok is scared.)

1204
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,780
It is very hot.

1205
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,380
Okay. Wait a second.

1206
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:14,080
This looks like the one I tasted.

1207
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,180
(Jae Seok puts it into his mouth to verify its taste.)

1208
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,150
It is too hot.

1209
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,680
It is so spicy!

1210
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,680
(What is this taste?)

1211
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,280
This looks like the one I tasted.

1212
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,180
Gosh! This is it!

1213
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,280
(It is spicy.)

1214
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,550
It is hot. It is hot.

1215
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:38,680
(He purchases it right away.)

1216
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,980
It is very hot. I think this is the one.

1217
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,980
(He seems to be in pain.)

1218
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:45,280
Oh, thank you so much.

1219
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,850
(He gives Jae Seok water to relieve the spiciness.)

1220
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,380
(Everyone in traditional markets around the world seems very nice.)

1221
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,480
- Take this.
 - This one?

1222
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:56,080
(The owner impresses his customer by giving him sweet dates.)

1223
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,480
This is so delicious.

1224
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,380
He is very kind.

1225
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,380
(The Dubaian merchant repeats after Jae Seok like a parrot.)

1226
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,980
Can I have one gram of this?

1227
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,180
One gram? Okay.

1228
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,750
(Jae Seok buys the spice from the first store he visited.)

1229
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,880
- Yes. Thank you very much.
 - Thank you.

1230
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,180
(Is this the one Jae Seok tasted earlier?)

1231
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:16,480
See you next time. Thank you.

1232
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,080
- Bye.
 - Bye.

1233
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:21,380
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo walked pretty deep into the market.)

1234
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,450
I'm looking for a spice.

1235
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:24,180
(Ji Hyo doesn't have a clue so far.)

1236
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,480
It's small, and something inside it popped when I chewed.

1237
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,880
- Do you want to take a look?
 - Yes.

1238
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,980
When I chewed it, something popped inside my mouth.

1239
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:45,080
(Spice Souk is a traditional market that sells a lot of exotic spices.)

1240
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,160
I can smell all the spices.

1241
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,280
(She's enjoying the smell.)

1242
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,180
What is this? Oh, it's black pepper.

1243
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,650
- Do you want to try?
 - No, thanks.

1244
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,950
(Black pepper)

1245
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:00,880
(And white pepper)

1246
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,180
Can I try this?

1247
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,150
(Let me taste Dubai's pepper.)

1248
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,180
(Ji Hyo chews to taste it.)

1249
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,980
(My goodness!)

1250
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,380
It's so hot.

1251
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:18,180
It is very hot.

1252
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,770
(It is very hot.)

1253
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:21,580
(It's so hot that she can't speak.)

1254
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,480
(You still have black pepper to taste.)

1255
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,860
(She tries black pepper bravely.)

1256
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:31,250
- Which one is better?
 - This one.

1257
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,880
(Her eyes are trembling.)

1258
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,280
This is...

1259
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,180
(Goodness!)

1260
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,680
(Oh my goodness!)

1261
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,080
It's so hot!

1262
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,780
(She can't take its spiciness.)

1263
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,820
(She's in panic.)

1264
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,980
Oh my! Give me that water.

1265
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:54,820
(She tries to cool it down by drinking water.)

1266
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,080
(But it doesn't work.)

1267
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:58,680
It's so hot!

1268
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,850
(It is extremely spicy.)

1269
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:03,180
It is so hot.

1270
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:07,540
- It is too spicy.
 - It is unbelievable.

1271
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,080
- We came back so soon.
 - Did you already find them?

1272
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,180
- Yes.
 - Wait.

1273
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,380
How can you...

1274
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,950
put this into my mouth?

1275
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,080
I got the right one, right?

1276
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,280
I used my tongue...

1277
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,080
to figure out its shape when you put it in my mouth.

1278
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,780
Me, too. I found mine easily because I remembered the shape.

1279
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,480
(Me, too. I found mine easily because I remembered the shape.)

1280
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,280
(I am sure nothing would be...)

1281
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,880
(as spicy as this one.)

1282
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,680
(Let's see if Jae Seok bought the right spice.)

1283
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,650
- You got it right.
 - I knew it.

1284
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:37,780
(Jae Seok completes his mission.)

1285
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,380
It's called chili.

1286
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:41,080
I see. This is chili.

1287
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,780
(Chili is Chilean pepper which has an extremely spicy taste.)

1288
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:46,960
- I want the members to try it.
 - I ate it all.

1289
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,480
This is called saffron.

1290
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,980
It's saffron.

1291
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,620
I am very confident.

1292
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,550
I can even bet all my wealth.

1293
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:58,950
I'm sure this is the right one. It's saffron.

1294
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,880
I think I'm genius. I found it so quickly.

1295
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,880
- Are you sure?
 - Yes, I am.

1296
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,380
I can even bet all my wealth.

1297
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,480
- Correct.
 - See?

1298
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,580
(Haha completes the mission.)

1299
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:09,650
Here it is.

1300
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,380
It is saffron.

1301
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,650
(Saffron is the most expensive spice in the world.)

1302
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:14,050
Saffron.

1303
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:17,680
Here you go.

1304
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,980
(Jae Seok and Haha cleared their missions in Spice Souk.)

1305
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,580
You can go if the other members of your team complete theirs.

1306
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,080
- Really?
 - Yes.

1307
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,180
The necklace with two peacocks.

1308
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,780
("A necklace with two peacocks under a bloomed lotus.")

1309
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,080
So it's a peacock necklace.

1310
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,280
("A necklace with two peacocks under a bloomed lotus.")

1311
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,980
"A necklace with two peacocks under a bloomed lotus."

1312
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,280
The necklace with two peacocks.

1313
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,450
(Which store here would have it?)

1314
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:39,780
It that it?

1315
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,380
Oh, there it is.

1316
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,880
(He found the gold.)

1317
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,780
Look at all the golden items.

1318
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,580
Let's go to find the necklace.

1319
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,380
(Will he be able to find the necklace there?)

1320
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,870
Excuse me.

1321
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:53,850
I'm looking for two peacocks.

1322
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:55,280
- Peacock?
 - Peacock.

1323
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,380
The necklace with two peacocks.

1324
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,880
(Follow me.)

1325
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,180
(He understood what Seok Jin said.)

1326
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,380
I think they have it.

1327
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,750
I think I will find it here at once.

1328
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:05,880
(I think I will find it here at once.)

1329
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,150
Two peacocks.

1330
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:08,180
(Two peacocks)

1331
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:10,880
They have to face each other.

1332
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,580
Wow, yes.

1333
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:15,480
(It's the splendid golden peacock.)

1334
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,180
- Did you mean this?
 - Well...

1335
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,280
It's supposed to be 2, but this has 4 peacocks.

1336
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,250
(This necklace isn't the right one.)

1337
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:24,980
It's 100,800 dollars.

1338
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,380
(How much is this necklace?)

1339
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,450
It is 100,800 dollars.

1340
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:30,850
(It is 100,800 dollars.)

1341
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:33,750
Gosh, it's 100,800 dollars.

1342
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,280
- Is it heavy?
 - Yes.

1343
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,080
- It's 2kg.
 - Really?

1344
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,950
Yes, it is.

1345
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:41,280
Okay, see you later.

1346
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,780
(Extremely expensive)

1347
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,480
See you again. It's too expensive.

1348
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,620
That's too much.

1349
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:51,580
I've seen 2kg of meat, but not 2kg of gold.

1350
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:54,180
I see gold everywhere.

1351
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,550
(It's gold everywhere.)

1352
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:57,880
(Wow!)

1353
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:00,180
Is this gold, too?

1354
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,880
Heavy golden items are so common like meats in this market.

1355
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:09,280
(He calms himself down and goes in to find the item again.)

1356
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,680
The necklace with two peacocks.

1357
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,280
It's the necklace with two peacocks if I remember it correctly.

1358
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,280
The necklace with two peacocks.

1359
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,880
(Seok Jin is looking for the necklace with two peacocks.)

1360
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,080
Two Peacocks.

1361
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,450
(Due to everything being gold, it's hard to tell the shapes.)

1362
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:22,320
- Hello.
 - Hello.

1363
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,380
There are two birds. Two peacocks.

1364
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:25,820
- Two peacocks?
 - Yes.

1365
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:27,080
It's a necklace.

1366
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,980
- Necklace?
 - Yes, a necklace.

1367
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,180
What? Is that it?

1368
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,340
(Could this be it?)

1369
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,070
I think that's it.

1370
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:37,280
Right?

1371
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,480
This must be it.

1372
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,160
This is it.

1373
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,650
This is the one.

1374
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:42,850
This is it.

1375
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:45,380
This is the one. This is the peacock necklace.

1376
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:48,250
This is 11,700 dollars, which is about...

1377
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,480
13,000,000 won.

1378
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,050
I think everyone would be really curious.

1379
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:52,530
I think this is the right one.

1380
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:53,750
Right?

1381
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:54,850
Is this the lotus?

1382
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:56,380
(A necklace with two peacocks under a bloomed lotus.)

1383
00:53:56,750 --> 00:54:00,280
I think I really found it. I hope it's the right one.

1384
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,750
There's Seok Jin.

1385
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:03,050
Did you find it?

1386
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:05,880
- Did you find it?
 - I think I did.

1387
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,750
- Seok Jin!
 - Hold on.

1388
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:09,480
Can you check if this is right?

1389
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:12,280
- I hope it's wrong.
 - Once Da Hey comes, we're done.

1390
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,370
Is it right? It has a lotus,

1391
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:16,450
and the peacocks are looking at opposite sides.

1392
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:19,060
- Da Hey needs to come.
 - The lotus is on top.

1393
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:21,480
I'm right. This is the peacock necklace.

1394
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,060
(A necklace with two peacocks under a bloomed lotus.)

1395
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,550
- Is it right?
 - Am I right?

1396
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:26,530
- Correct.
 - Yes!

1397
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:28,050
- No way.
 - How did this happen?

1398
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:29,450
It was really hard to find.

1399
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:31,320
The necklace...

1400
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,050
Wow. This feels great.

1401
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:34,650
You just have to wait for Da Hey to come back.

1402
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:37,050
- Can we go when she comes?
 - Yes, you can leave immediately.

1403
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,480
(They can go visit the place where the Golden Grasshopper sleeps.)

1404
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,480
(Il Woo, Kwang Soo and Da Hey are going to the fabric market.)

1405
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,850
Lala Fried.

1406
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:44,730
- This is so hard.
 - Is it "Lala Fried"?

1407
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:46,080
How do you say it again?

1408
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,850
- Alsa Nabe.
 - What did you say earlier?

1409
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:49,850
- Isalam.
 - Was it "Lala Side"?

1410
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:51,950
- How do you say it?
 - Alsala Nabe.

1411
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:53,430
Come on.

1412
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:55,180
You made me forget!

1413
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,950
Is it "Lala Side"?

1414
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:58,480
Hold on.

1415
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:00,750
- What did I say...
 - Nuwat Sabe.

1416
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,280
Is it "Lala Side"?

1417
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,380
- Lala Side?
 - It's "Lala Lala".

1418
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:05,850
- Is it "Lata Side"?
 - What?

1419
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:06,850
(Il Woo runs off as soon as they get to the dock.)

1420
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:08,450
(Let's go.)

1421
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:10,350
Was it Mr Kakarela?

1422
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:15,080
(Dubai Textile Souk has 500 kinds of textiles and traditional clothes.)

1423
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,580
Is he Mr Kakarela?

1424
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:22,880
(Where would the item be at this huge textile market?)

1425
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,550
(He talks to a merchant at the local market.)

1426
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:30,280
Excuse me, are you the shop owner?

1427
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,850
- Yes, I am.
 - Is your name...

1428
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:33,950
(What's your name?)

1429
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:35,180
(Courageous Il Woo)

1430
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,880
(Whom will be the person he meets for the first time?)

1431
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:42,650
Purchase Warud Tattris from Parkashu Mulani's store.

1432
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:45,280
(Purchase Warud Tattris from Parkashu Mulani's store.)

1433
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,180
(Now, I have to remember.)

1434
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:49,250
Parsha Dame?

1435
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,750
Parsha Dame? His name is Parsha Dame.

1436
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,480
- Parsha Dame?
 - Yes.

1437
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,680
Parsha Dame...

1438
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,650
Parsha... Parsha Dame.

1439
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:03,850
- No. That's the wrong name.
 - There's no one by that name.

1440
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:07,480
- Parsha Dame?
 - Parsha Dame.

1441
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,080
- Did you write it down?
 - No, no.

1442
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,020
- Did you write it?
 - Parsha Dame.

1443
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,850
- Farsha Dame?
 - Parsha Dame.

1444
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:13,950
- Parsha Dame...
 - Parsha...

1445
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:15,850
- Dame?
 - The name you have is wrong.

1446
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:17,150
There's no one by that name.

1447
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:19,480
- Parsha Dame?
 - Parsha Dame.

1448
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,280
- Farshu?
 - Parsha Dame.

1449
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,650
(Communication has failed.)

1450
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:23,750
(Purchase Warud Tattris from Parkashu Mulani's store.)

1451
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:26,360
I can't remember what I heard.

1452
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,050
I'm slowly losing it.

1453
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:29,180
(He's losing it in the middle of the street in Dubai.)

1454
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,050
- Assana Bear?
 - Hi.

1455
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:32,480
Assana Bear?

1456
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,050
(Da Hey is making up words, too.)

1457
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:36,820
Assana Bear?

1458
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,650
This is driving me crazy.

1459
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:40,150
Assana Bear?

1460
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:42,180
- What is your name?
 - Assan.

1461
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,050
- Assan?
 - Assan.

1462
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:45,850
Do you have any fabric called...

1463
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:47,880
(She successfully finds someone with the same name.)

1464
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,180
- Pel...
 - Come, come!

1465
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,750
Pel... What was it again?

1466
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,080
(Purchase Pelbunapssaji from Assan Amin's store.)

1467
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,380
For...

1468
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,350
What's that fabric's name?

1469
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:57,650
- My name?
 - No, the fabric's name.

1470
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:58,850
Pel...

1471
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:01,180
(She has the first syllable right.)

1472
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:03,650
Assanabel and Pel... Pelbonocchia?

1473
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:04,750
What was it?

1474
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,150
(Go purchase Pelbunapssaji from Assan Amin's store.)

1475
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:09,380
I really forgot. What am I going to do?

1476
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:13,730
Pelbonasase?

1477
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:16,080
(She's desperate.)

1478
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,550
Do you have anything similar?

1479
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:18,750
Pelbonapsase?

1480
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:22,250
(She's trying to say it gracefully.)

1481
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:25,430
Pelbonapsase?

1482
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:27,650
I don't think this is it.

1483
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:28,750
I'm...

1484
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:30,620
I'm in trouble.

1485
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:33,280
Hello, Kakarela? Kakarela?

1486
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,080
(Kwang Soo is focusing on "Kaka".)

1487
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:38,280
Kakarela? What's your name?

1488
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,580
- Hamil.
 - Hamil.

1489
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,850
Nice to meet you, Hamil.

1490
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:44,080
(We're looking desperately for Mr Kakairela.)

1491
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,180
Kakarela?

1492
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:46,280
(We're looking desperately for Mr Kakairela.)

1493
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,450
Kakarela!

1494
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:48,580
(Purchase Nal Asuwad from Kakairela's store.)

1495
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:51,580
Kakarela?

1496
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:52,750
(Kwang Soo didn't flip his hourglass, so he has little time.)

1497
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,150
Mr Kakarela?

1498
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,180
Mr Kakarela? Kakarela?

1499
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,580
- Yes.
 - Kakarela?

1500
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,020
(Kakarela, I hear your voice.)

1501
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,650
Who's Kakarela?

1502
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:04,020
Kakarela?

1503
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:06,750
(Is it really Mr Kakarela?)

1504
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,580
I'm sorry, I don't know what you're saying.

1505
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,750
- I'm a friend.
 - A friend?

1506
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:11,580
- Kakarena.
 - Kakarena?

1507
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13,180
Kakarena, nice to meet you!

1508
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,550
Kakarena!

1509
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:15,750
(But Kwang Soo is wrong. The mission asked for Kakairela.)

1510
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:17,550
Kakarena, I found you.

1511
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:18,980
You're my brother!

1512
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:20,480
You're my family!

1513
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,350
(Welcome to Kakarena's store.)

1514
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:26,580
(He immediately dresses up Kwang Soo.)

1515
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:27,850
That's not it.

1516
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:30,380
- What's your name?
 - My name is Abdullah.

1517
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:33,230
- Abdullah?
 - Yes.

1518
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:34,780
You said you were Kakarena?

1519
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,550
My Arabic name is Abdullah.

1520
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:39,080
- I see.
 - My Pakistani name is...

1521
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,780
- Kakarena?
 - Yes.

1522
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,580
Apra... Apra Side?

1523
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,820
Abra?

1524
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,480
I forgot.

1525
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:50,620
Apra Side?

1526
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:52,650
(Mr Kakarela,)

1527
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:55,380
(can you understand what I'm saying?)

1528
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:57,450
This is cheap. It's Gangnam style.

1529
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:00,180
- Gangnam style?
 - Yes, this one's Gangnam style.

1530
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:03,020
- Gangnam style?
 - This is Gangnam style.

1531
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:04,860
How is this Gangnam style?

1532
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,180
Just try it.

1533
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,850
(Try it first.)

1534
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:09,380
No, this isn't it.

1535
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,050
Apra Side?

1536
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:12,280
(This is Apra Side style.)

1537
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,380
Kakarela.

1538
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:14,880
I need Apra Side.

1539
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,480
Amura Side?

1540
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,580
Amura Side!

1541
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:19,020
- Do you want it?
 - Yes, I want it.

1542
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,050
Okay.

1543
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:21,080
(From "Nal Asuwad" to "Apra Side" to "Amura Side")

1544
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:24,150
It's a mission! Is Amura Side even correct?

1545
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:26,550
Is this it? This is big.

1546
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:27,880
Check.

1547
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,080
What is this called?

1548
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,980
This is Kandora.

1549
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:32,450
- Kandora?
 - Yes.

1550
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:34,080
I don't need Kandora, I need Amura Side.

1551
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,750
It's the same.

1552
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:38,650
- Is it the same one?
 - Yes.

1553
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:40,650
You can try this one.

1554
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:41,950
(Now he's trying to make Kwang Soo change.)

1555
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:44,350
- It's your size.
 - It's not for me.

1556
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:46,270
You can try this one.

1557
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:47,980
There's no need...

1558
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:50,150
I don't need to try it.

1559
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:54,020
(Prince of Dubai)

1560
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,080
Check it.

1561
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,380
No, I need Amura Side.

1562
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:58,580
Yes, Amura Side. Look at the mirror.

1563
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:02,580
(I didn't need to buy a new outfit...)

1564
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:04,280
This isn't what I needed...

1565
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,480
Amura Side?

1566
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,850
Okay.

1567
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,480
How much is it?

1568
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:13,650
54 dollars?

1569
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:14,850
Okay?

1570
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,430
Amu...

1571
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:18,380
I need Abu... Amura Side.

1572
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:19,580
This is Amura Side.

1573
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:21,080
(He's still unsure.)

1574
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,880
Nalbura... Nal Brown.

1575
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,080
- Light brown?
 - No, not light brown.

1576
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,950
(One's accepting a bargain, one's just confused.)

1577
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:29,680
La... Lala Sound?

1578
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,050
(They cannot understand each other.)

1579
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:34,550
I'm not asking him to give me a discount.

1580
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:36,650
(He's giving Kwang Soo a discount.)

1581
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:37,950
Lalo Sound?

1582
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:39,810
(Fine, I'll reduce it a bit more.)

1583
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:41,870
- This is the best I can do.
 - Okay.

1584
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:43,450
Okay.

1585
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:44,750
Thank you.

1586
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:46,050
- Okay, bye.
 - Bye.

1587
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,550
It's cheap.

1588
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:48,750
Cheap?

1589
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:49,950
What was your name again?

1590
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:51,280
- Kakalop.
 - Kakalop?

1591
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,850
- Yes, Kakalop.
 - It wasn't Kakalop before.

1592
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:53,950
(He was Kakarena 10 minutes ago.)

1593
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:55,450
Apra Side?

1594
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:57,740
Lapra... Life Side?

1595
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:00,850
If I get it right, that would be crazy.

1596
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:02,440
This is hard.

1597
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,650
Is this...

1598
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:05,080
(He's going back to see if he bought the right fabric.)

1599
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,380
Is this right?

1600
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:08,070
Amura Side?

1601
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:09,750
Apra Side?

1602
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,050
- Do you know Amura Side?
 - Yes.

1603
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,950
What's the name of this?

1604
01:01:16,450 --> 01:01:18,050
- Kandora.
 - Kandora?

1605
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:19,080
Kandora.

1606
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,650
Is there another name?

1607
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:22,780
- This is Kandora.
 - Kandora?

1608
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:26,750
Kandora?

1609
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:29,050
No, this is Amura Side!

1610
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:30,480
Kakarela told me...

1611
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,550
(Kakarela told me that this is Amura Side...)

1612
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:32,950
Abdullah...

1613
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:37,150
That is Kandora.

1614
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:39,580
- Is this Kandora?
 - Yes.

1615
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:41,150
(I've been fooled.)

1616
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:47,320
(It's too late to turn back. The "Kandora's box" is open.)

1617
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:50,050
(Goodbye, my lovely Kakarela.)

1618
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:52,080
This is cheap. This is Gangnam style.

1619
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,480
(Goodbye, my lovely Kakarela.)

1620
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:58,350
(He's feeling bitter.)

1621
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,450
I have to hurry back and flip my hourglass.

1622
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:05,580
(There is only a minute left in his hourglass.)

1623
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:07,480
I have no...

1624
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,480
time.

1625
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:12,480
(He's desperate.)

1626
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,650
I will...

1627
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:15,330
die.

1628
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:16,940
(Giggling)

1629
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:18,720
I...

1630
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,960
I have to hurry.

1631
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,880
My life is on the line.

1632
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,280
I have to flip the hourglass.

1633
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,450
(I have to flip this hourglass because my life is on the line.)

1634
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,480
Go faster.

1635
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,080
(Grinning)

1636
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,050
The other boats are passing us.

1637
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:35,380
(They're getting further and further away.)

1638
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:40,480
I feel like everyone else is on motorcycles, but I'm on a bike.

1639
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:43,530
My life is on the line!

1640
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:44,950
I have to flip the hourglass...

1641
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:46,080
(Please, hurry up.)

1642
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,450
Go faster.

1643
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,180
We're here. Thank you.

1644
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:51,280
(Time is gold. I have to save the hourglass.)

1645
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,150
(Running)

1646
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:57,280
(Kwang Soo is back.)

1647
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,880
- You're fast.
 - Kwang Soo, you're amazing.

1648
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,750
- I knew it.
 - Kwang Soo, you're out.

1649
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:03,020
You're dead already.

1650
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:08,280
Kwang Soo is dead.

1651
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,550
Kwang Soo already died.

1652
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:11,580
- He's dead already.
 - Can you tell him he's dead?

1653
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:12,880
Kwang Soo is really dead.

1654
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,080
Kwang Soo, you're out.

1655
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,840
- You're dead.
 - You're dead.

1656
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,080
(Please tell me I'm dreaming.)

1657
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,960
- Write it down.
 - You were dead long ago.

1658
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,550
- If everyone agrees...
 - Kwang Soo is out.

1659
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:23,080
(Kwang Soo is out.)

1660
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,450
You're out.

1661
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:25,980
You died in Dubai.

1662
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:29,380
(He can't believe this.)

1663
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:33,650
(What is with this Golden Grasshopper?)

1664
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:36,450
(Why did I strive this much?)

1665
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:38,120
- It's the same?
 - Yes.

1666
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:45,120
(I can't lose so helplessly like this.)

1667
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:48,080
Are you going to use your second chance?

1668
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,850
- I need to.
 - Without consent?

1669
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:51,180
You need consent.

1670
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:52,750
I need to use it before my team members come.

1671
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:55,350
I'll use my second chance!

1672
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:59,580
(The person whose hourglass ended can be given a second chance.)

1673
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:04,080
(Kwang Soo is given a second chance.)

1674
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,920
You are truly a betrayer.

1675
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,720
How could you use it already?

1676
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,820
I need to live.

1677
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:12,080
- Do you think they'll help me?
 - You are truly a betrayer.

1678
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,450
It's best that they're not here.

1679
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:15,880
You're right. It's a good thing that they're not here.

1680
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:18,020
They wouldn't have let you use it.

1681
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,180
Is he with Ji Hyo and Gary?

1682
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:20,750
(What will Kwang Soo's fate be?)

1683
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:24,880
(Meanwhile, Gary and Ji Hyo are unaware of this.)

1684
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:28,050
(They are diligently performing the mission.)

1685
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:29,480
Look!

1686
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,590
Wait.

1687
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:36,070
There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

1688
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:37,550
(There are exactly nine moons.)

1689
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:39,060
There are nine.

1690
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:40,820
This is it, right?

1691
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:43,550
"The huge moon holds five jewels."

1692
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:45,220
Three.

1693
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:48,230
Four. Five.

1694
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:50,120
It's this.

1695
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,650
(Will he succeed in carrying out the mission?)

1696
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:57,480
I'm done.

1697
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:02,080
(Ji Hyo's discerning the spices.)

1698
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:08,950
(Will her taste buds come back to life after the pepper incident?)

1699
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:10,950
Ji Hyo is here.

1700
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:16,530
Here's the jewel.

1701
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:18,180
Gary, you're right.

1702
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,220
Okay! Ji Hyo!

1703
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:23,320
I am hoping this is right.

1704
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,850
I'm sure.

1705
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,750
I hope it's right, Ji Hyo.

1706
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:31,050
- You're right.
 - I knew it.

1707
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:33,180
- Isn't it coriander?
 - Oh, that's coriander.

1708
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,980
I could smell it.

1709
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,180
Jong Kook is in trouble.

1710
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:38,650
He doesn't have much time.

1711
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:40,850
He probably has calculated everything.

1712
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:42,180
He does have a second chance.

1713
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:44,380
I bet he is counting down the seconds.

1714
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,820
There's a lot.

1715
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:49,250
(The shining red leaf runs up the wrist and meets the leaf.)

1716
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:50,980
I don't know which it is.

1717
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,880
I really don't know.

1718
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:55,950
I think it'll be here somewhere.

1719
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:59,350
Is it that one? Are those the red veined leaves?

1720
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:04,180
(Will Jong Kook's hunch prove to be right?)

1721
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:05,950
There's not much time left. I need to go.

1722
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:08,730
I don't have any more time to spare.

1723
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:10,480
Let's go.

1724
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,080
Jong Kook.

1725
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,280
You need to come quickly!

1726
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,590
I told you he's meticulous.

1727
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:19,950
Here. "The shining red leaf..."

1728
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:25,280
"runs up the wrist and meets the leaf."

1729
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,280
Jong Kook, you're right.

1730
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,680
I knew it.

1731
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,750
- I wasn't even worried.
 - But...

1732
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:33,850
they looked all the same. There was a bunch of these.

1733
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:35,480
Il Woo needs to come.

1734
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:38,250
Il Woo isn't as smart as I expected him to be.

1735
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:39,750
What are we going to do about him?

1736
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,650
Da Hey still needs to come.

1737
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:43,020
We can leave once she comes.

1738
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:46,080
- She needs to come soon.
 - The actors aren't doing well.

1739
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,920
Yes, including Kwang Soo.

1740
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,850
It's all up to the members looking for fabric.

1741
01:06:49,850 --> 01:06:51,380
(Everything depends on the members in the fabric market.)

1742
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:57,480
(They have cleared each of their missions.)

1743
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:01,580
(Let's make a run for it.)

1744
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:05,320
Lala Side. Kakarela.

1745
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:08,920
It's this one. Hello!

1746
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:10,480
I need Wareud Tattris.

1747
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:13,080
- What's your name?
 - Kakairela.

1748
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,750
Kakairela? Hello.

1749
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:16,020
Really?

1750
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:17,540
It's nice to meet you.

1751
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:20,080
Assan Amin?

1752
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,450
(I have finally found the place.)

1753
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:23,850
Give me a hug.

1754
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:26,050
Assan Amin!

1755
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,080
Wait a minute.

1756
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,020
(Purchase Pel Bunapssaji from Assan Amin's store.)

1757
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,550
Fel Bunapssaji?

1758
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:35,060
- Yes.
 - Fel Bunapssaji?

1759
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:36,450
Pel Bunapssaji?

1760
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:38,650
Pel Bunapssaji. This colour?

1761
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:40,080
Do you know Pel Bunapssaji?

1762
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:43,620
The first word is "Wa".

1763
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:45,080
Wa... Wa?

1764
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,180
(Purchase Warud Tattris from Parkashu Mulani's store.)

1765
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:47,980
War Kar...

1766
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:51,180
- Lala Side. Please...
 - Lala?

1767
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:52,650
Lala Side, please!

1768
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:54,230
(Purchase Warud Tattris from Parkashu Mulani's store.)

1769
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:55,850
(Wareud Tattris?)

1770
01:07:55,850 --> 01:07:57,850
Hey, I think that's right.

1771
01:07:57,850 --> 01:07:59,480
Okay. Okay.

1772
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,850
(Purchase Pel Bunapssaji from Assan Amin's store.)

1773
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:04,750
- Nal Asuwad?
 - Nal Asuwad. Black colour.

1774
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,450
Is it black? I want...

1775
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:07,780
- Are they shoes?
 - Yes.

1776
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:09,280
I don't know if this is right.

1777
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:11,650
(If you've made a choice, then make a run for it.)

1778
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:12,990
I need to go quickly.

1779
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:14,880
I need to go quickly. I don't have much time.

1780
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:18,120
Assal Amin!

1781
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,850
My heart feels like it's about to burst.

1782
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:22,580
(The fate of the three teams depends on these three.)

1783
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:24,380
It's more difficult than skydiving.

1784
01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:27,650
(Which team will be awarded the advantage?)

1785
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:29,950
Quickly. Go quickly.

1786
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,380
It's hot.

1787
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:34,280
The sun is too hot.

1788
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:37,250
Da Hey!

1789
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:39,880
Jae Seok!

1790
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:43,230
I got Pel Bunapssaji!

1791
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:44,950
Da Hey, come quickly!

1792
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:50,150
Please be wrong, please be wrong.

1793
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:55,080
(If she's wrong, she needs to go back to the market.)

1794
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,080
(Running)

1795
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,920
- Please be wrong.
 - I got Pel Bunapssaji.

1796
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,190
(Jae Seok, I'm back.)

1797
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:03,020
- You got it, right?
 - Yes.

1798
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:04,350
- Please be wrong.
 - It's this.

1799
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:06,280
- We'll check it.
 - It can't be right.

1800
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,650
Assan Amin...

1801
01:09:07,650 --> 01:09:09,250
- Kwang Soo.
 - Really.

1802
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:11,970
- We'll check.
 - Please, please, please!

1803
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:13,280
- Please.
 - Please!

1804
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:16,970
You bought Pel Bunapssaji from Assan Amin, right?

1805
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:18,280
- Da Hey.
 - Yes?

1806
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:23,820
(Will Team Jae Seok be able to win the advantageous position?)

1807
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:27,450
(She can't be right.)

1808
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:29,050
- Da Hey.
 - Yes?

1809
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:32,050
You're right.

1810
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:33,550
(Da Hey is right.)

1811
01:09:33,550 --> 01:09:37,750
(Team Jae Seok can go to the final location.)

1812
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:38,950
- Hey!
 - We did it.

1813
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:40,450
We did it!

1814
01:09:40,450 --> 01:09:41,690
- Where do we go now?
 - All right.

1815
01:09:41,690 --> 01:09:44,080
(First place winners are given the ultimate clue.)

1816
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,550
- It's this.
 - Is this the clue?

1817
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:47,150
(The Golden Grasshopper is hidden somewhere. Sand can turn it back.)

1818
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:48,280
What does this mean?

1819
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:50,450
(Each team will hide their hourglasses.)

1820
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:53,960
- It was really difficult.
 - It must have been.

1821
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,250
Good job, Da Hey.

1822
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:57,750
- Oh, my.
 - Good job.

1823
01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:00,650
- This has low battery.
 - Look over there.

1824
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:01,950
This is how it works.

1825
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:03,550
(They are taking a photo to celebrate their victory.)

1826
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:04,990
- Come over quickly.
 - Do it like this.

1827
01:10:04,990 --> 01:10:07,950
- This is how you do it.
 - Oh, my.

1828
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,950
- Like this.
 - Okay.

1829
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:12,190
It's done.

1830
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:13,450
Let's take one.

1831
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:14,850
(Since we're in Dubai, we need to take a photo.)

1832
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:16,080
Let's celebrate our victory.

1833
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,070
One, two...

1834
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:19,280
(Let's find the Golden Grasshopper!)

1835
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,490
- Okay.
 - We can do it.

1836
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:24,450
- Hey!
 - Is it Il Woo?

1837
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:27,240
Haha!

1838
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:29,280
- I'm here!
 - Did you find it?

1839
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,120
(Il Woo arrives in second place.)

1840
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:35,190
It's this. It's this.

1841
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:37,220
(This is Warud Tattris!)

1842
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,580
(I love you.)

1843
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:41,650
(He is 200 percent confident.)

1844
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:42,820
Goodness.

1845
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:44,350
(What are you doing, Kwang Soo?)

1846
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:47,060
- I'm here.
 - It's see-through.

1847
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:48,580
It looks beautiful.

1848
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:50,150
This is Warud Tattris.

1849
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:52,220
Il Woo,

1850
01:10:52,990 --> 01:10:54,190
you got it right.

1851
01:10:54,190 --> 01:10:55,550
(Il Woo got it right.)

1852
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:57,690
- Yes.
 - Warud Tattris.

1853
01:10:57,690 --> 01:10:58,850
(We're ruined.)

1854
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:00,990
Gosh, I'm so jealous.

1855
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,650
(The Secret of the Grasshopper: To change it into gold,)

1856
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:04,280
Oh, my.

1857
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,080
(it needs 9 hourglasses. If your name tag rips, you will lose sand.)

1858
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,280
It's what we're great at.

1859
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:11,450
- Oh, my.
 - This is the game for us.

1860
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:12,980
We can take this.

1861
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:14,350
(They have lost hope.)

1862
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,490
What? Did Il Woo succeed?

1863
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:20,420
(Kwang Soo's hourglass has been sitting here for a long time.)

1864
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:22,250
(Running)

1865
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,120
Is there still time left? How is it?

1866
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:31,450
Nal Asuwad.

1867
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:34,020
Did you buy Nal Asuwad from Kakairela?

1868
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:35,530
Yes.

1869
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:36,750
Kwang Soo.

1870
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:39,950
(He can't be wrong.)

1871
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:41,820
(What will their fate be?)

1872
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:43,430
Kwang Soo.

1873
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:44,950
- You're right.
 - Yes!

1874
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:46,080
(Kwang Soo got it right.)

1875
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,080
(They have made it!)

1876
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,720
Good job.

1877
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,050
Let's go.

1878
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:52,820
Here's your clue.

1879
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:55,980
"You will be given the opportunity to change your time..."

1880
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:58,690
"with another's when you go to this place."

1881
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:01,380
"You will be given the opportunity to change your time..."

1882
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:03,850
- "with another's."
 - What does it mean?

1883
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:06,850
- We can change with others.
 - Maybe we can switch them.

1884
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:11,320
(This is the location for the final mission.)

1885
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:14,190
(Team Jae Seok has arrived first.)

1886
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:15,850
I get nervous every time I come to a mission location.

1887
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:17,190
This is the last mission.

1888
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:18,850
- It's the last one?
 - It's the last.

1889
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:21,050
- Oh, my.
 - We only need to win this.

1890
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:23,050
I'm so tired. Why is it so long?

1891
01:12:23,050 --> 01:12:26,720
"This place was not generous to strangers."

1892
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,080
"The Stone Grasshopper is hidden somewhere. and it needs sand..."

1893
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:31,750
"to be turned back into the Golden Grasshopper."

1894
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:34,550
"First, each team will hide their precious hourglasses somewhere."

1895
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:37,250
"And set off to find the opportunities to win."

1896
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:40,080
"Opportunities". We need these opportunities to win.

1897
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,190
Opportunities...

1898
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,080
The reason why it needs sand is...

1899
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,970
It mentioned something about name tags.

1900
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:48,650
It said that if your name tag is ripped, you lose the sand.

1901
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:51,190
- Their sand will become ours.
 - I will keep on...

1902
01:12:51,190 --> 01:12:54,080
maintaining my time in secret...

1903
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,490
while getting rid of others' through ripping their name tags.

1904
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:01,540
Let's go to the opposite building.

1905
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:02,850
This place is very large.

1906
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:04,370
- It is.
 - It's nice here.

1907
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:06,190
What is this place?

1908
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:08,320
- This place...
 - Over there.

1909
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:11,080
Maybe it's a mosque.

1910
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,550
(Bastakiah is the oldest residential area in Dubai. There are...)

1911
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:15,950
(ancient ruins alongside traditional houses, mosques and restaurants.)

1912
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:19,190
- It looks like an ancient city.
 - It looks very ancient.

1913
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:20,380
(Bastakiah)

1914
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:21,450
It looks like an ancient city.

1915
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:23,970
It's beautiful.

1916
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:25,190
I want to take pictures.

1917
01:13:25,190 --> 01:13:27,580
- It's beautiful.
 - Indeed.

1918
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:30,080
We should turn the hourglasses around now and then.

1919
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,450
(Team Jae Seok is looking for chances.)

1920
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:35,490
Is it connected to here?

1921
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:39,050
(Looking around)

1922
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,580
(Oh, my.)

1923
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:45,820
Oh, my goodness.

1924
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:47,350
How did I find it?

1925
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:49,050
This is exciting.

1926
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:50,880
(This is exciting.)

1927
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:53,050
(Da Hey finds a chance.)

1928
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:54,680
Thank you.

1929
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,250
I should tell the other members.

1930
01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:00,380
(What does this chance say?)

1931
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:03,080
What is this? "Chance to Exchange".

1932
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,880
"You can exchange your hourglass..."

1933
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,250
"with someone else's."

1934
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:09,620
Good.

1935
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:12,750
I should go tell the other members.

1936
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:13,990
(What are the other teams up to?)

1937
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:16,050
It'll be hard to find here, Kwang Soo.

1938
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:17,920
(Team Kwang Soo is still hiding their hourglasses.)

1939
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,050
Lift me up. One, two, three.

1940
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:22,950
(They hide their hourglasses on top of a high wall.)

1941
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:25,280
You won't be able to reach them when you're alone.

1942
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:26,850
Does this one have more?

1943
01:14:26,850 --> 01:14:28,350
Yes.

1944
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:32,280
How can we find such small things?

1945
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:33,580
They should be somewhere.

1946
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:36,250
I'm sure they're on trees.

1947
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:38,750
(Keeping a sharp eye)

1948
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:41,490
Is this car immobile? Is it supposed to just stay here?

1949
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:45,190
- Seok Jin.
 - Kwang Soo, what are you up to?

1950
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:47,350
- Have you found anything?
 - No, I haven't.

1951
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,950
- Seok Jin.
 - Is your hourglass smaller... No.

1952
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:51,750
(Has your hourglass gotten smaller?)

1953
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:52,950
How much sand is left?

1954
01:14:52,950 --> 01:14:54,190
(Seok Jin is trying to change the subject.)

1955
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:55,280
Has my hourglass gotten smaller?

1956
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,950
(Has my hourglass gotten smaller?)

1957
01:14:57,950 --> 01:14:59,050
Will my hourglass get smaller?

1958
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:00,380
(Will my hourglass get smaller?)

1959
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:02,860
- Will my hourglass get smaller?
 - No, it won't.

1960
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:04,950
- You said so.
 - No.

1961
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:06,280
- I heard it.
 - Gosh!

1962
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:08,850
How will it become smaller?

1963
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:11,690
- Seok Jin's hourglass got smaller!
 - No, it didn't.

1964
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:13,250
- Am I right?
 - No, that's not true.

1965
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:15,050
Have you found anything?

1966
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:16,380
No, I haven't.

1967
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:18,480
- See you around.
 - Bye.

1968
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,750
Bye.

1969
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:21,750
I should find something.

1970
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,750
- Gosh.
 - Oh, my.

1971
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:25,820
- Goodness.
 - Da Hey, has your hourglass...

1972
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:27,280
gotten smaller?

1973
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,230
Why would it become smaller?

1974
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:31,650
- That's what Seok Jin said.
 - Will it become smaller?

1975
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:33,050
(Da Hey is pretending that she has no idea.)

1976
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:34,190
- He said it'll get smaller.
 - What are you talking about?

1977
01:15:34,190 --> 01:15:35,450
Did the hourglasses become smaller?

1978
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:37,190
Gary, Seok Jin says his hourglass has become smaller.

1979
01:15:37,190 --> 01:15:39,280
- What?
 - I'm not sure.

1980
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,650
- Really?
 - Do they become smaller?

1981
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:41,750
- That's not it.
 - How much is left?

1982
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:43,050
(2 versus 2)

1983
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:45,690
- Hourglasses must become smaller.
 - How much sand do you have left?

1984
01:15:45,690 --> 01:15:47,190
Why do you want to know that?

1985
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:49,880
How does it get smaller?

1986
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,080
(Ripping off your name tag makes it smaller.)

1987
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,950
You're asking me when I'll die.

1988
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:55,480
- Seok Jin.
 - Why?

1989
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,780
Why did you stare at Gary's name tag?

1990
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:58,080
I didn't. I was just looking.

1991
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,450
Seok Jin...

1992
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:00,750
Can we rip off the name tags?

1993
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:03,050
- We can't.
 - We're not supposed to do that.

1994
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:04,550
- Try if you want.
 - Are you sure?

1995
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:05,580
Sure.

1996
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:08,650
(Seok Jin pushes them away.)

1997
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:10,050
Rip it off!

1998
01:16:10,050 --> 01:16:11,280
- That's not it.
 - Try ripping it off.

1999
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,850
- That's not it.
 - Rip it off.

2000
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:15,380
- I guess we just need to rip them.
 - That's not it.

2001
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:16,450
Has your hourglass become smaller?

2002
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:17,580
- No.
 - Thank you.

2003
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,350
Why would it become smaller?

2004
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,470
- Seok Jin.
 - What?

2005
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:24,850
- Why did you say that?
 - I didn't mean to.

2006
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:26,690
You should have just kept talking.

2007
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:28,280
Then I could have ripped it off.

2008
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:30,780
Seok Jin is being scolded by Da Hey...

2009
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:33,550
- No, he's not.
 - for telling me about it.

2010
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:34,850
That's not it.

2011
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:36,080
Gosh...

2012
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,580
(Oh, my.)

2013
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:40,190
- Why did I do that?
 - How can you do that?

2014
01:16:40,190 --> 01:16:41,780
I would've guessed it, too.

2015
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:45,650
Something must happen when you rip off a name tag.

2016
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:47,720
Should we try? Should we?

2017
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,250
Let's do that.

2018
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:53,080
(The desert is glowing with sunset.)

2019
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:56,190
(Night is falling...)

2020
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:58,750
(on every street in Bastakiah.)

2021
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:02,850
(Jae Seok came to check his hourglass.)

2022
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:04,490
Where's Seok Jin?

2023
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:06,190
(Seok Jin does not have a lot of sand left.)

2024
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:07,580
Seok Jin!

2025
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:09,480
Seok Jin!

2026
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:10,850
(His hourglass might be changed into a smaller one.)

2027
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:12,850
- Seok Jin!
 - What? Who is it?

2028
01:17:12,850 --> 01:17:14,650
- Seok Jin!
 - Who are you?

2029
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:16,190
It's me. Hurry up and come!

2030
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:17,280
Where are you?

2031
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,380
(Hurrying)

2032
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,480
(Gary follows them.)

2033
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,950
- Hurry and turn it around.
 - What do you mean?

2034
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:24,080
- Turn it around.
 - My hourglass?

2035
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,380
(Am I running out of time?)

2036
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:27,690
(Less than a minute is left.)

2037
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:29,150
That was close.

2038
01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:32,250
- Oh, my.
 - Turn it around right now.

2039
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:34,080
- Thank you.
 - Did you rip off anyone's name tag?

2040
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,490
(Did you rip off anyone's name tag?)

2041
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:38,280
(Did you rip off anyone's name tag?)

2042
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:40,280
(Gary heard everything!)

2043
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,880
You messed it all up.

2044
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:44,580
Get him! Go get him!

2045
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:46,280
We're supposed to rip off each other's name tags!

2046
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:47,450
(He realises everything now.)

2047
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:48,550
He heard us. Get him!

2048
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:50,850
(Catch Gary!)

2049
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:52,250
Go that way.

2050
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:54,150
No!

2051
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,450
- Rip his name tag off.
 - Okay.

2052
01:17:58,450 --> 01:17:59,880
We should do that.

2053
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,490
(Hiding)

2054
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:04,820
Come here, come here.

2055
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:06,350
(Careful)

2056
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:08,950
(I heard something.)

2057
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,750
There! Gary's over there!

2058
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:12,850
(Gary is there.)

2059
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:16,780
(They set out to corner Gary.)

2060
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:22,080
(They'll attack him from both ends of the street.)

2061
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,580
Gary.

2062
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:27,350
- Gary.
 - Don't come close.

2063
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:28,950
That's not it.

2064
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:30,950
- We need to talk.
 - Give me a second.

2065
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:32,280
We need to talk.

2066
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,580
- Come here.
 - Seok Jin.

2067
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:37,690
(He's surrounded.)

2068
01:18:37,690 --> 01:18:39,190
Wait!

2069
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:40,280
- Get off of me!
 - Just a second.

2070
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,080
(We have no mercy for you.)

2071
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,280
Wait.

2072
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:44,820
Let go of me!

2073
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,280
(Da Hey rips Gary's name tag.)

2074
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,990
Get off of me!

2075
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:53,580
(Once your name tag gets ripped off,)

2076
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:56,250
(your hourglass is changed into a mini-hourglass.)

2077
01:18:57,250 --> 01:19:00,950
(Does it have to be that small?)

2078
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:02,190
That's about 5 minutes long.

2079
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:03,380
(He is on a time crunch.)

2080
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:04,850
Ji Hyo!

2081
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:06,850
Kwang Soo, Ji Hyo!

2082
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,550
Come here!

2083
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:09,650
(Gary calls for them.)

2084
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:11,650
- What's wrong?
 - We need to rip off name tags.

2085
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:13,280
- I heard they attacked you.
 - Hey.

2086
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,190
- My name tag was ripped off.
 - Yours?

2087
01:19:15,190 --> 01:19:16,950
- I was attacked by three of them.
 - Who were they?

2088
01:19:16,950 --> 01:19:18,190
It was Team Jae Seok.

2089
01:19:18,190 --> 01:19:20,380
When it gets ripped off, it turns into a mini-hourglass.

2090
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:21,690
- Was yours changed?
 - Yes.

2091
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:22,950
So we have to rip off theirs.

2092
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:24,850
Wait. Jae Seok is here.

2093
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:26,050
(They spot Jae Seok.)

2094
01:19:26,050 --> 01:19:29,350
Should we rip his name tag off?

2095
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:32,350
Jae Seok! Let's make a deal.

2096
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,050
You know there's two second chances, right?

2097
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:37,380
- Team Haha has two.
 - Really?

2098
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:38,850
- They have two.
 - You have two, right?

2099
01:19:38,850 --> 01:19:40,250
No, I don't.

2100
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:41,950
- Jae Seok.
 - Stop.

2101
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:43,870
(Kwang Soo attacks Jae Seok.)

2102
01:19:43,870 --> 01:19:45,960
(This is for Gary.)

2103
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,750
(Gary rips his name tag off.)

2104
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:52,150
What goes around comes around.

2105
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:53,990
Now, let's cooperate.

2106
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:55,580
Let's cooperate.

2107
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:57,690
- Let's cooperate.
 - Let's cooperate.

2108
01:19:57,690 --> 01:20:00,490
(Jae Seok has a mini-hourglass now.)

2109
01:20:06,850 --> 01:20:08,580
Is this because your name tag was ripped off?

2110
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:09,850
(Team Jae Seok is developing strategies.)

2111
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:11,430
Since this one doesn't last long,

2112
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:13,380
I shouldn't be away too far.

2113
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:15,280
Let's stay here.

2114
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,620
- Okay.
 - We'll stay here...

2115
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:20,230
and exchange it with someone else like Jong Kook.

2116
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:21,990
Whom should we exchange it with?

2117
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:23,950
It'll be hard to rip off Il Woo's name tag.

2118
01:20:23,950 --> 01:20:26,450
He won both times before.

2119
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:27,990
If he wins again, it'll be his third win.

2120
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,490
We shouldn't let it happen.

2121
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:33,280
- Sorry, Il Woo.
 - Goodness, Il Woo.

2122
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,960
Here in Dubai,

2123
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,150
Arabian Nights will begin.

2124
01:20:37,550 --> 01:20:39,050
Let the magic begin.

2125
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:40,750
(This night will be dedicated to Il Woo.)

2126
01:20:46,990 --> 01:20:49,190
(Jae Seok's mini-hourglass is exchanged with Il Woo's.)

2127
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:50,640
What is this?

2128
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:53,380
- Why is yours so small?
 - What happened?

2129
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:54,850
- Is Il Woo out?
 - Is he?

2130
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:56,280
(Il Woo ran out of time.)

2131
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,480
We should find chances.

2132
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,850
We shouldn't mind the time, go back and forth often.

2133
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:02,950
I wonder why they chose Il Woo instead of me.

2134
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:04,190
(Il Woo is in danger.)

2135
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:05,750
Did they think I'm the ace?

2136
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:08,380
- That could be possible.
 - Is that so?

2137
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:12,470
- Kwang Soo.
 - Hi.

2138
01:21:12,470 --> 01:21:14,280
Hi. I just stopped by.

2139
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:16,190
Did you exchange your hourglass?

2140
01:21:16,190 --> 01:21:17,950
- What?
 - You have a chance.

2141
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:19,080
- This...
 - Wait!

2142
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,190
(Sneaking)

2143
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:22,580
(Da Hey attacks Kwang Soo.)

2144
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:23,950
- Wait!
 - Seriously?

2145
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:25,050
- If you do this...
 - That's not it.

2146
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:26,820
- That was her own decision.
 - I don't believe it.

2147
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:28,850
- I just wanted to try it.
 - If you do this...

2148
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:30,550
- Is this what you were going for?
 - No, that's not it.

2149
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:32,780
- We should change our plan.
 - Calm down.

2150
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:35,380
Think about how your next hourglass will look.

2151
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:36,580
There won't be another one.

2152
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:37,850
(He tells them everything.)

2153
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:39,050
There won't be another one.

2154
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:40,280
- That's not true.
 - That's not it.

2155
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:41,820
- There won't be another one.
 - Then we should...

2156
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:43,450
- That's the last hourglass.
 - Gosh. What's wrong with you?

2157
01:21:43,450 --> 01:21:45,280
- There won't be another hourglass.
 - Really?

2158
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,580
Will Jae Seok be out?

2159
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:48,690
Why did you have to say that?

2160
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:50,820
- I don't know.
 - Seok Jin is flustered.

2161
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:52,650
- Look at Seok Jin.
 - Should we leave here?

2162
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:55,380
He has given me at least four hints so far.

2163
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:57,280
Thanks to him, I found out the hourglasses will become smaller.

2164
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,850
(Seok Jin is The Giving Tree of hints.)

2165
01:22:00,650 --> 01:22:02,150
Aren't I humane?

2166
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:06,050
Listen up.

2167
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:07,950
- That team...
 - I'm worried.

2168
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:09,450
thinks... No, it's okay.

2169
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:10,690
It'll be gone in a second.

2170
01:22:10,690 --> 01:22:12,280
Let's exchange it, then.

2171
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,580
- What were you saying?
 - Team Jae Seok...

2172
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:16,850
- is not hard to beat.
 - Right.

2173
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:19,080
But we won't be able to beat Team Haha.

2174
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,450
Right. I agree with you.

2175
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:23,280
Then let's exchange it now.

2176
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,450
Should we go for Jong Kook?

2177
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:25,690
(They're going to exchange it right before it finishes.)

2178
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:26,820
We'll use our "Chance to Exchange".

2179
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:28,350
(Their target is Jong Kook.)

2180
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:30,550
(Team Jae Seok and Team Haha are together.)

2181
01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:31,750
You should be careful.

2182
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:34,280
- Jong Kook, you're out.
 - What?

2183
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:35,380
- What?
 - Why?

2184
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:37,380
(Am I out?)

2185
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:39,480
(Guess what?)

2186
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,280
(Our strategy worked.)

2187
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:44,050
(I'll be back.)

2188
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:47,450
There are only two left.

2189
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:48,950
(This is our chance.)

2190
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:50,280
Ji Hyo! Ji Hyo!

2191
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:51,780
(This is our chance.)

2192
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:52,850
(Team Jae Seok is thinking the same.)

2193
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:54,620
It's just us now.

2194
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:56,550
- Haha, it's just us.
 - Don't do this.

2195
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:58,050
We should do it now!

2196
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:00,450
- We should do it now!
 - Hold him!

2197
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:01,880
You should have grabbed him!

2198
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:03,850
(Jong Kook, where are you?)

2199
01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:05,250
What?

2200
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,480
(Haha is caught.)

2201
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,750
Rip it off.

2202
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:10,250
(Gary rips it off.)

2203
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,250
(Haha has a mini-hourglass.)

2204
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,080
Gary!

2205
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,380
- Gosh.
 - Gary.

2206
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:22,880
Where is Gary?

2207
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:26,990
- Gary!
 - Gary!

2208
01:23:26,990 --> 01:23:30,080
Gary!

2209
01:23:30,490 --> 01:23:33,520
Gary! Gary!

2210
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,190
You should've ran.

2211
01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:36,690
Why did you stay still?

2212
01:23:36,690 --> 01:23:37,880
That's not true.

2213
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:39,750
What do you mean? You stayed there doing nothing.

2214
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:41,490
Okay, I'll run.

2215
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:44,690
(Gary runs away.)

2216
01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:46,280
Catch him!

2217
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:49,750
Kwang Soo, help me!

2218
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:50,880
(Kwang Soo comes to help Gary.)

2219
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,490
I'll take care of this.

2220
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,480
Run! Run away!

2221
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:55,850
(Kwang Soo catches Da Hey.)

2222
01:23:55,850 --> 01:23:57,280
(I am sorry, Da Hey.)

2223
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,880
I got it!

2224
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,750
(Da Hey's turns into a mini-hourglass.)

2225
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:02,180
We did it.

2226
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:10,880
Gary,

2227
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,680
you're permanently out due to your hourglass running out of time.

2228
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:15,820
When did they switch my hourglass?

2229
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:17,190
I guess one of them switched it.

2230
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:19,080
No, no one switched it.

2231
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:20,880
- What are you talking about?
 - You just had little time left.

2232
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,480
- I saw it.
 - What?

2233
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:23,780
- I mean your hourglass...
 - I had an hour!

2234
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:25,190
How did I run out of time?

2235
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:27,080
An hour has passed long time ago!

2236
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,480
I can't believe it.

2237
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,320
(I should've set a timer.)

2238
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,880
(Now,)

2239
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,770
(three warriors...)

2240
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:44,780
(are ready for the final battle.)

2241
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:48,780
(Let's enjoy our last night in Dubai.)

2242
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:50,980
Hello, guys.

2243
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:52,050
(All the teams have gathered.)

2244
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:53,490
We all meet here.

2245
01:24:53,490 --> 01:24:55,380
- It is...
 - How could we...

2246
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:57,050
meet like this?

2247
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,080
This is how it goes.

2248
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,280
- We have no choice.
 - Yes, this is...

2249
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,690
You have three healthy men.

2250
01:25:01,690 --> 01:25:03,880
- But you have the ladies.
 - What do you mean?

2251
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,020
Then let's exclude the ladies.

2252
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:07,150
Why?

2253
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:08,780
- What?
 - We want to be with them.

2254
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:10,480
We are a family.

2255
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,190
It's not fair.

2256
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:15,280
- You have the ladies.
 - They may be better than us, men.

2257
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,780
That's what I mean. Your team will have an advantage.

2258
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:18,850
What do you mean?

2259
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:20,750
Let's just do it. We have no time to hesitate.

2260
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:22,080
- Let's do it.
 - Okay.

2261
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,280
I'm fed up with this life.

2262
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,380
- Right. I'm fed up.
 - I don't want to live like this...

2263
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:27,050
- any more. I'm going.
 - I want to finish...

2264
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:28,190
this way of life.

2265
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:30,380
Look at Jong Kook. The look in his eyes changed.

2266
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:31,650
- Look at him.
 - Be careful.

2267
01:25:31,650 --> 01:25:33,190
- He's angry now.
 - I'm scared.

2268
01:25:33,190 --> 01:25:34,750
He's angry, so be careful.

2269
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:36,990
We have to make a circle and move around.

2270
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:38,450
That's exactly what we think.

2271
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:40,160
Let's move around.

2272
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:41,380
(Jong Kook grabs Seok Jin...)

2273
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:42,950
(and rips his name tag off.)

2274
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:44,780
(Seok Jin is out in a blink of an eye.)

2275
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:46,190
Move away.

2276
01:25:46,190 --> 01:25:47,190
What...

2277
01:25:47,190 --> 01:25:48,780
My goodness.

2278
01:25:53,490 --> 01:25:55,880
(The battle continues.)

2279
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:57,580
(Kwang Soo and Da Hey cooperate...)

2280
01:25:57,580 --> 01:25:59,190
(to take Haha down.)

2281
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:01,480
- Rip it!
 - What? No way!

2282
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,680
- Grab him!
 - Hurry!

2283
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:05,380
Ji Hyo is permanently out.

2284
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:07,660
She ran out of time.

2285
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:09,050
Why?

2286
01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:10,380
- Gosh.
 - Jae Seok, I'll be right back.

2287
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:12,480
- Wait, Kwang Soo.
 - What?

2288
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,780
We have to make sure we have enough time.

2289
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:14,880
Can we run away like this?

2290
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,080
(Let's catch Jae Seok and Kwang Soo.)

2291
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,080
Jae Seok, keep running.

2292
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,380
There they are.

2293
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:21,950
No. It's too dangerous.

2294
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:23,180
Watch out.

2295
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:25,880
(Da Hey grabs Il Woo's name tag.)

2296
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:27,580
- Il Woo is out!
 - I got his name tag!

2297
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:28,750
Il Woo!

2298
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,690
(Da Hey's attack was unexpected.)

2299
01:26:30,690 --> 01:26:31,780
Il Woo!

2300
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:36,680
(Il Woo is out.)

2301
01:26:38,990 --> 01:26:42,690
(Jong Kook versus Jae Seok, Kwang Soo and Da Hey)

2302
01:26:42,690 --> 01:26:44,190
Gosh, he's too strong.

2303
01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:46,680
(All of them are very exhausted.)

2304
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:49,380
(Jae Seok grabs Jong Kook.)

2305
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:52,050
(Jong Kook grabs Jae Seok.)

2306
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:12,380
(Jae Seok grabs Jong Kook.)

2307
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:15,050
(Jong Kook grabs Jae Seok.)

2308
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:17,680
(Ripping)

2309
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:21,580
(Jae Seok removed Jong Kook's name tag first.)

2310
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:28,480
(Jong Kook is out, too.)

2311
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:33,880
(Jae Seok and Da Hey versus Kwang Soo)

2312
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:36,740
Wait.

2313
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:40,750
(Kwang Soo is out.)

2314
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:41,950
No, I thought...

2315
01:27:41,950 --> 01:27:43,280
- After Jong Kook removed...
 - It's just...

2316
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,580
Jae Seok's name tag, the game paused, right?

2317
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:47,150
Wasn't Jong Kook...

2318
01:27:47,150 --> 01:27:48,480
- out?
 - Listen to me, people.

2319
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,780
- No, it's...
 - You didn't betray this time.

2320
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:52,450
I did my best...

2321
01:27:52,450 --> 01:27:53,680
I did...

2322
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:56,180
- Didn't you...
 - Jong Kook removed your name tag!

2323
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:57,280
(Da Hey is smarter than Kwang Soo.)

2324
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,180
Kwang Soo, it's over.

2325
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:02,050
- This can't be true!
 - Go home, Kwang Soo.

2326
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:07,080
(It's time to meet "The Legend of the Golden Grasshopper".)

2327
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:09,580
(The winners, Jae Seok and Da Hey,)

2328
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:13,750
(enter the secret room.)

2329
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:18,280
(They pour the sand of life into the bowl in front of the platform.)

2330
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,750
- Oh, my.
 - It's your friend.

2331
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:28,480
It's your friend and your ancestor.

2332
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:30,180
Hurrah for the Grasshopper!

2333
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:32,480
- We won!
 - We did it!

2334
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,880
(Hurrah for the Grasshopper!)

2335
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:38,080
- Good job, guys.
 - You all did so well.

2336
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:41,280
I'll take the photo now. One, two, three!

2337
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,180
(They a selfie to keep their memories of Dubai.)

2338
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:46,050
Wow. Look at this palm tree.

2339
01:28:46,050 --> 01:28:47,680
(Our two days in Dubai was very memorable.)

2340
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:50,880
(This city on top of a desert is 10 hours away from Seoul.)

2341
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,180
That building is really high.

2342
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:54,980
(A lot of fans greeted the Running Man members.)

2343
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:57,380
- That's amazing.
 - Skyscrapers are everywhere.

2344
01:28:57,380 --> 01:29:00,280
(They ran around the city and flew in the blue sky.)

2345
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:03,670
I've been on Running Man before.

2346
01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:07,250
But still, you all took care of me, so I'm really thankful.

2347
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:08,880
(Thank you for helping me.)

2348
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:10,880
It was fantastic.

2349
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:13,060
(Da Hey will never forget her days in Dubai.)

2350
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:15,580
(Mission complete: Running Man in Dubai in 2016)

2351
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:17,250
Is this gold?

2352
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:20,150
We'd like to say, "Thank you" to the people who helped us...

2353
01:29:20,150 --> 01:29:21,480
here in Dubai. Thank you very much!

2354
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:22,880
- Thank you!
 - Thank you!

2355
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:28,280
(Next week!)

2356
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,580
An angel came here today.

2357
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:31,880
- I am a bad guy.
 - Yu Jae Seok has said that he'll...

2358
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:32,980
reveal everything in detail.

2359
01:29:32,980 --> 01:29:34,950
Kwang Soo, the Asian Prince, is...

2360
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:36,840
(No one really knows who they are.)

2361
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:39,580
Haven't you loved me at least for a day?

2362
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:41,480
(You'll see how they really are.)

2363
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:45,780
(Get to thoroughly know the members. "All About Them".)
