1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,870
(Unlucky person)

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,570
(An unlucky person is attracted to unlucky events or energy.)

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,000
(This time, they will pick Korea's unluckiest person.)

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,400
(They can't be unluckier than this.)

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,570
(Jung Jung A is 1 in 6 million people to be bitten by an anaconda.)

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,290
(An initial member of Running Man, Lizzy only suffered and left.)

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,790
(Nam Chang Hie is one of the unluckiest entertainers.)

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,860
(Kim Tae Hee's little brother Lee Wan is another unlucky man.)

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,070
Who's the unluckiest man? Announcing in 1, 2, 3!

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,800
(Unlucky)

11
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,100
- Hello.
 -  Hello.

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,460
- The First Unluckiest Festival.
 -  Hello.

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,930
- Hello. Hello.
 -  The First Unluckiest Festival.

14
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,790
- The unluckiest...
 -  They are feeding us.

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,760
- They are feeding us again.
 -  The unluckiest festival.

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,290
Unlucky, unlucky, unlucky

17
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,660
Isn't this a festival for us?

18
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,730
- I am very unlucky.
 -  And...

19
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,890
after hearing all the complaints, I made changes.

20
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,100
Did you allow your manager to put on some music in the car?

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,100
I told him to put on some music, but he refused.

22
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,290
- He kept refusing.
 -  Maybe you've become distant.

23
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:00,570
- Gosh, I am...
 -  And...

24
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,890
Put on some music.

25
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,100
- Put on some music.
 -  Bye.

26
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,910
Put on whatever music you want to listen to.

27
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,190
Make sure you turn up the volume.

28
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,940
Let me hear how loud it'll be!

29
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,090
- Go on.
 -  Put on some music.

30
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,860
Come on, play some music.

31
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,100
Let us hear some music.

32
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,990
- Bye, Jae Seok!
 -  Bye!

33
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,600
- Bye.
 -  Bye.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,590
(Jae Seok is always willing to listen to your complaints.)

35
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,930
- Gosh...
 -  Gosh...

36
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,200
Kwang Soo, why are you the only one dressed differently?

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,490
- Kwang Soo is...
 -  He got sponsored.

38
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,790
- We are all wearing...
 -  Casual outfits.

39
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,100
He used to wear hats, but after becoming a prince, he stopped.

40
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,760
- What? That's not true.
 -  I am telling the truth.

41
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,190
And he only wears long coats.

42
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,090
- I love long coats.
 -  He only wears them.

43
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,360
- I wear these to sleep, too.
 -  You and Joong Ki are different.

44
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,990
Stop talking about Song Joong Ki!

45
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,580
(He doesn't want to hear Joong Ki's name.)

46
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,730
(He's burning with a sense of rivalry.)

47
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,960
Don't mention Song Joong Ki in front of me.

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,190
- Let's have a brainwave test.
 -  Come on.

49
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,890
- Kwang Soo, you're just...
 -  We might be able...

50
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,720
- a fellow comedian.
 -  to see his brainwaves.

51
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,090
Why do you keep denying it?

52
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,290
Stop talking about Joong Ki!

53
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,760
- You are a comedian and an actor.
 -  You are a member of Running Man.

54
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,190
- Yes.
 -  Yes. You're a fellow comedian.

55
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,830
Why do you try to compete with Joong Ki and In Sung?

56
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,000
Many young comedians look up to you.

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,360
- Yes.
 -  Too many people are discouraged.

58
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,190
You should start paying the monthly membership fee of SBS comedians.

59
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,590
(We should have a rival special with Kwang Soo and Joong Ki.)

60
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,290
- Gosh...
 -  Isn't today's special...

61
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,990
for Kwang Soo, Seok Jin and me?

62
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,190
It's for the three of us, isn't it?

63
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,290
Haha is pretty unlucky, but he's luckier than us.

64
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,590
I'm in the shadows thanks to them.

65
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,800
Honestly speaking, you're one of us.

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,290
- Wait.
 -  I am...

67
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,000
- Ji Hyo is the luckiest one.
 -  Right, she is.

68
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,400
Then it's Jong Kook.

69
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,500
- Gary is all right.
 -  Isn't Gary just ugly?

70
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,090
Hold on. I am sorry.

71
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,700
I feel like hitting you three times a day.

72
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,600
- He just looks unlucky.
 -  Let go of me!

73
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,390
- Yes.
 -  The unluckiest situation would...

74
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,760
- Being lucky just for today.
 -  be being lucky just for the day.

75
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,490
It's because the unluckiest person will win today.

76
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,690
And you won't get any attention.

77
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,350
Last week, there was a question many people asked.

78
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,300
They wanted to know who the unluckiest member was.

79
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:56,990
So we prepared this special.

80
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,460
Today, we're going to have The First Unluckiest Festival.

81
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,490
All right!

82
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,090
There's no tension at all. It's one of these guys.

83
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,990
- Being really unlucky is...
 -  The answer is given.

84
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,540
- getting lucky today.
 -  That's right.

85
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,990
Among the members, three people will be leaders.

86
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,190
Each leader will cast unlucky people from the entertainment industry.

87
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,290
I see.

88
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,790
You will join the festival with them,

89
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,930
and the unluckiest team will be chosen.

90
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,200
- And then?
 -  And the unluckiest person...

91
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,560
in that team will become the unluckiest man.

92
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,390
- Okay.
 -  All right, I see.

93
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,830
So we will pick the unluckiest person from the unluckiest team.

94
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,490
- Right?
 -  So today, it's good to be unlucky.

95
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,000
- Right.
 -  You have to meet a good leader.

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,200
- The unluckiest man wins.
 -  He will be the hero.

97
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,770
We will pick the 3 leaders from the 4 unluckiest members.

98
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,290
The three members who are relatively lucky will wait at the lobby.

99
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,300
Do we just have to wait?

100
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,670
From second floor to 11th floor, there are a total of 10 floors.

101
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,200
Among the 10 floors, 5 floors will have penalties.

102
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,000
The remaining five will be penalty-free.

103
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,100
Each of you will choose three floors, and...

104
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,390
the three people who get the most penalties will become the leaders.

105
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,300
So the unluckier ones will become the leaders.

106
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,200
- Bye.
 -  See you later.

107
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,370
- Go, Kwang Soo!
 -  Okay. See you later.

108
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,100
As long as I don't get penalties... Or is it better to get them?

109
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,190
- You will choose three floors.
 -  Okay.

110
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,110
- We'll start bottom up.
 -  From the second floor to the 11th?

111
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,290
(On 5 floors, the penalty team awaits.)

112
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,940
(On the other 5 floors, the lucky team awaits.)

113
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,490
- 10th floor.
 -  10th floor.

114
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,990
(Kwang Soo chooses 10th floor.)

115
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,990
Next is the seventh floor. The lucky seven.

116
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,490
10th floor, seventh floor and...

117
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,660
(Kwang Soo chose 10th and 7th floors.)

118
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,470
Maybe there is no penalty on the second floor.

119
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,390
- Second floor.
 -  10th floor,

120
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,590
- seventh floor and second floor.
 -  Yes.

121
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,550
You can get on the lift and press those numbers.

122
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,840
Is it good to get the penalty?

123
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,840
(Welcome to the luck test lift.)

124
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,000
Please.

125
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,870
10th floor.

126
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,590
Seventh and second floors.

127
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,610
(Will he prove how unlucky he is?)

128
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,190
Here we go.

129
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,190
(He arrives on the 10th floor.)

130
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,200
The beginning is important.

131
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,110
Right?

132
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,000
(Will Kwang Soo get unlucky as usual?)

133
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,490
Hello.

134
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,930
(A man fills the lift with chalk dust.)

135
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,560
(Kwang Soo showers in chalk dust.)

136
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,090
Gosh, stop!

137
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay! Okay!

138
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,700
This is the penalty, right?

139
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,300
Okay.

140
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,300
Penalty...

141
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
This is the penalty, right?

142
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,700
(He smirks.)

143
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,200
Okay.

144
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,470
So I got unlucky on my first choice.

145
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,370
I got unlucky on the 10th. I'll go with the seventh.

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,700
I guess I am really unlucky.

147
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,000
(He arrives on the 7th floor.)

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,190
Is this the seventh floor?

149
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,970
(Will he get unlucky again this time?)

150
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,000
Seventh floor.

151
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,560
Seventh floor.

152
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,930
(What's this?)

153
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,190
What?

154
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,700
(Oh dear!)

155
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,410
Wait.

156
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,140
I got my makeup done less than an hour ago.

157
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,700
Thank you. Today, I should feel happy about this.

158
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,340
Thank you, everyone.

159
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,590
Thank you!

160
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,140
(He has two penalties so far.)

161
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,930
It doesn't...

162
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,330
(Why am I not happy?)

163
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,400
It doesn't feel so nice.

164
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,730
This is the last floor.

165
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,140
I don't think there will be a penalty on the lowest floor.

166
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,100
Here we are.

167
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,030
(Will Kwang Soo get lucky this time?)

168
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,140
Here we are.

169
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,220
(Or will he be punished for the third time in a row?)

170
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,440
It's the second floor. What is this?

171
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,540
(Rushing)

172
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,320
What is this?

173
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,170
(He is showered with kisses.)

174
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,740
(There is love in the elevator.)

175
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,240
(Run towards Kwang Soo's lips!)

176
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,310
(Gosh!)

177
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,400
You little...

178
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,330
(Kwang Soo was penalised with a man's kisses.)

179
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,530
(Kwang Soo received penalties on all three floors.)

180
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,740
Did I get penalties on all three floors?

181
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,730
Was it on all three floors?

182
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,840
(Against the odds of 12 to 1, he was penalised 3 times.)

183
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,500
- What happened to your face?
 -  What happened?

184
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,240
I'll definitely be chosen as the leader.

185
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,930
(Kwang Soo was penalised on all three floors.)

186
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,530
I chose three floors,

187
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,840
and they all had penalties!

188
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,590
(You're such an unlucky person.)

189
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,730
- Did you go first?
 -  You never disappoint me.

190
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,290
- You had your makeup done.
 -  Yes, I did.

191
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,430
- You're so unlucky.
 -  Gosh, Kwang Soo.

192
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,590
They did this to your face even though you had makeup on.

193
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,050
- Yes, they did.
 -  My goodness.

194
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,490
I bet I'll be the leader.

195
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,730
- When you showed up all dressed up,
 -  That's right.

196
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,240
I knew something like this would happen.

197
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,190
I'm worried about Jae Seok.

198
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,240
(The second candidate, Seok Jin)

199
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,940
Why are the walls covered with plastic?

200
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,580
Why are they covered? This doesn't feel right.

201
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,600
I'll just go with my gut.

202
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,740
I shouldn't think too much.

203
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,840
The ninth floor.

204
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,100
(Seok Jin chooses the 9th floor.)

205
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,940
I'll just go with my gut.

206
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,840
(What will be waiting for Seok Jin?)

207
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,030
(Seok Jin's first choice turns out to be a lucky one.)

208
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,240
Should I be happy or not?

209
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,540
Okay.

210
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,500
Is this a good thing or a bad thing? I'm confused.

211
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,940
The seventh floor.

212
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,240
Shouldn't I be unlucky today?

213
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,840
Why was I hoping to be lucky?

214
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
We're on the seventh floor.

215
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,540
(Wish me bad luck!)

216
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,940
(Will he be penalised as he wishes?)

217
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,390
What's this? This is the penalty.

218
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,530
Please don't draw on my face.

219
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,720
(He begs.)

220
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,300
(Drawing a moustache)

221
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,940
Is it removable?

222
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,710
Gosh! Please!

223
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,110
(He was lucky on the 9th floor and unlucky on the 7th floor.)

224
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,220
I look like a cunning man.

225
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,330
(His moustache makes him look cunning.)

226
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,970
I hope I won't spend the day looking like this.

227
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,230
(Unfortunately, you will.)

228
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,490
The third floor.

229
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,100
I shouldn't have chosen the seventh floor...

230
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,490
as the number seven is considered lucky.

231
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,940
(Unlucky people tend to regret too late.)

232
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,090
(They're on the 3rd floor now.)

233
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,420
(How will his last choice turn out?)

234
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,590
Okay.

235
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,130
(Seok Jin is lucky today.)

236
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,500
Wait. I don't think I'll be the leader.

237
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,490
Right?

238
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,330
I won't be able to be the leader.

239
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,590
(It doesn't seem likely that Seok Jin will be the leader.)

240
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,930
I should have been penalised all three times.

241
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,130
(For now, Kwang Soo is in the lead.)

242
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,390
I was penalised only once.

243
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,230
(For now, Kwang Soo is in the lead.)

244
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,940
I received two flower necklaces.

245
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,940
Gosh, I'm wearing too many flower necklaces.

246
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,790
- Look!
 -  Seok Jin!

247
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,730
- He didn't get any penalties.
 -  Did he not?

248
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,200
(Seok Jin is being unusually lucky today.)

249
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,840
I received two flower necklaces.

250
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,020
That means you passed.

251
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,330
- Is that so?
 -  Did you get only one penalty?

252
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,490
Yes. How about him?

253
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,800
- He was penalised three times.
 -  I'll be the leader.

254
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,120
He was penalised all three times.

255
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,740
Three times? Is that true?

256
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,020
Kwang Soo, I admire you.

257
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,930
That's unbelievable.

258
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,090
He's amazing.

259
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,140
I'm scared of myself.

260
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,230
We should see if Kwang Soo is possessed by some evil spirit.

261
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,330
- What are you talking about?
 -  You never know.

262
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,730
It might be true.

263
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,940
- Look at Haha.
 -  Haha also seems fine.

264
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,490
- How many do you have?
 -  Did you get none?

265
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,820
- He wasn't penalised at all.
 -  I have two necklaces.

266
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,770
- Are you wearing two necklaces?
 -  Yes.

267
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,590
I'll choose fourth, sixth and ninth floors.

268
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,600
(Haha chose 4th, 6th and 9th floors.)

269
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,740
(He was penalised once.)

270
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,840
Seok Jin, you're amazing.

271
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,830
Kwang Soo was penalised all three times.

272
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,030
- Really?
 -  He was penalised three times.

273
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,330
You're such an unlucky person.

274
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,400
- Don't say that.
 -  How can this be possible?

275
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,520
You're perfect for variety shows.

276
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,730
Jae Seok is taking long. He must be getting penalised.

277
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,830
You're right. Receiving necklaces doesn't take long.

278
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,230
Receiving penalties takes long.

279
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,490
I have a question about the guy who kissed me.

280
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,030
Was he supposed to grab my bottom?

281
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,130
(The man even grabbed Kwang Soo's bottom.)

282
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,330
- He wasn't, was he?
 -  He's here.

283
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,590
Jae Seok is here.

284
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,500
(What happened to Jae Seok?)

285
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,330
He's wearing one flower necklace.

286
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,740
(How was Jae Seok?)

287
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,840
We're on the seventh floor.

288
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,300
What is this?

289
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,530
Is this the penalty? What are you doing?

290
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,490
(He was penalised on the 7th floor.)

291
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,730
(The 5th floor)

292
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,030
Is this a lucky floor?

293
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:28,490
(He got 1 penalty and 1 flower necklace.)

294
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:33,740
(He was penalised for his third choice.)

295
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,810
(Unlucky)

296
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,020
Congratulations, you'll be the leader!

297
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,190
You'll be the leader.

298
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,630
Did you choose the seventh floor?

299
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,910
Yes, I did.

300
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,030
It's lucky seven!

301
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,330
- It's a lucky number.
 -  I knew it.

302
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,290
No one can beat the three of us.

303
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,530
- But you're the unluckiest.
 -  You're the one.

304
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,190
I don't want to be one of them.

305
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,680
- Seven is a lucky number.
 -  Look at you three.

306
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,330
We really are unlucky.

307
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,510
Seok Jin and Haha have the same score.

308
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,670
- Take these boxes.
 -  Okay.

309
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,830
Take these boxes.

310
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,130
(One of them is empty.)

311
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,340
One is empty, and the other has something interesting in it.

312
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,230
The one who has something inside the box becomes the leader.

313
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,330
- Oh, really?
 -  Really?

314
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,600
All right, let's go.

315
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,500
Exchange them if you want.

316
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,500
(He changes his mind easily.)

317
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,590
- This feels right.
 -  One...

318
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,690
One, two, three.

319
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,930
(They're opening the boxes.)

320
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,700
(Who will be the third leader?)

321
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,590
Oh, I got something.

322
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,690
Mine is empty!

323
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,830
What's that?

324
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,490
(Seok Jin is the third leader.)

325
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,680
This is unbelievable.

326
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,690
It's because they exchanged them.

327
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,230
You can't do anything about your bad luck.

328
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,730
This is amazing.

329
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,590
Am I supposed to put this on my head?

330
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,080
Seok Jin seems to be enjoying this.

331
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,390
No, I'm not.

332
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,740
- He looks very happy.
 -  Are you jealous?

333
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,140
My head!

334
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,330
(The stockings tear.)

335
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,440
They got torn!

336
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,740
- Look at him.
 -  Haha, like this?

337
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,180
I can't look at him.

338
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,530
What's that?

339
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,010
- That's too ugly.
 -  He looks so ugly.

340
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,270
- He looks like Frankenstein.
 -  Hey.

341
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,730
He's so unlucky that even the stockings got torn.

342
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,830
- They really did tear.
 -  I can't believe that.

343
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,030
It's amazing.

344
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,230
Help me. It hurts.

345
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,530
It's really hard...

346
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,540
to choose.

347
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,520
Stand behind the leader you want.

348
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,290
- Goodness.
 -  Welcome to the world of bad luck!

349
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,590
One, two, three.

350
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,630
Come to me...

351
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,940
- Come on!
 -  if you want bad luck!

352
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,130
- Come to me.
 -  Trust me.

353
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,470
- Come to me.
 -  Come to me.

354
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,630
Welcome to my world.

355
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,730
- Will they choose?
 -  Two,

356
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,740
three.

357
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,390
(Please pick me!)

358
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,140
(Whom did they choose?)

359
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,670
(Gary and Ji Hyo chose Seok Jin, Jong Kook and Haha chose Kwang Soo.)

360
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,600
(No one chose Jae Seok.)

361
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,690
- Yes!
 -  Nice!

362
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,730
(Kwang Soo and Seok Jin can have two more members.)

363
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,030
You should choose the oldest.

364
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,300
Do I have to invite four people then?

365
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,940
- Our leader is great.
 -  How can I be so unlucky?

366
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,830
- I love my team.
 -  You should choose the oldest.

367
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,490
Go find people to recruit.

368
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,740
Hurry up.

369
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,200
(Unlucky)

370
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,340
Wait. What should I do?

371
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,630
How will I find four people?

372
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,330
In addition, I have to find unlucky people.

373
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,730
Someone did come to my mind.

374
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,930
He's the unluckiest person in the world.

375
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,700
(Who is the first person Jae Seok thought of?)

376
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,840
Hi, Jae Seok.

377
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,200
I need your help.

378
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,130
- Do you need my help?
 -  Yes.

379
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,210
(He agrees to help right away.)

380
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,340
I think we should meet fist.

381
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,930
- Sure.
 -  Where do you live?

382
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,770
- I'll text you my address.
 -  Okay.

383
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,920
Now, I know where I should go.

384
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,030
So let's go.

385
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,340
Fine. I'll prove that...

386
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,970
I'm the unluckiest.

387
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,740
If we're to find someone unlucky,

388
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,300
even though we're the ones left...

389
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
No way.

390
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,840
Lizzy was one of the Running Man members in the very beginning.

391
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,530
There were many other members.

392
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,830
- Run!
 -  Stop!

393
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,390
- Run!
 -  Chase Joong Ki!

394
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,040
(Song Joong Ki was one of the members, too.)

395
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,130
Joong Ki became successful after leaving Running Man.

396
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,590
Joong Ki became very successful.

397
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,140
But Lizzy was a member back then, and...

398
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,190
- She's doing all right, too.
 -  Just imagine.

399
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,390
Imagine she stayed with us.

400
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,130
Her life would have changed.

401
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,240
I'd say...

402
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,540
we should ask Lizzy's opinion.

403
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,290
How are you doing, Lizzy?

404
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,390
(They're going to ask Lizzy to be on Running Man again.)

405
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,820
I've missed you.

406
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,940
Oh, hello?

407
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,440
Wait, is this Lizzy?

408
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,130
Yes, this is Lizzy.

409
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,740
- What are you doing?
 -  What are you up to?

410
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,090
I'm lying on my bed.

411
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,690
Don't you know what time it is?

412
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,040
Lizzy, don't you know what time it is?

413
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,940
Lizzy, don't you have any work to do?

414
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,730
Not much.

415
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,500
(She has a lot of free time.)

416
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,490
I do have some work, but it's not much.

417
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,470
Lizzy, actually, we're shooting Running Man right now.

418
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,710
- Oh, really?
 -  Yes.

419
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,110
Today, we have to invite...

420
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,240
the unluckiest people.

421
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,140
- Lizzy, we're sorry about this.
 -  Lizzy.

422
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,500
You were the first person we could think of.

423
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,290
I'm really sorry about that.

424
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,600
Lizzy, how about we get together today?

425
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,790
- What do you think?
 -  Are you talking about drinking?

426
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,190
- No.
 -  No...

427
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,590
Please stop making me sad!

428
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,570
- Lizzy.
 -  Do you drink often these days?

429
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,900
Lizzy...

430
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,070
- Poor Lizzy.
 -  Lizzy.

431
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,890
- You're number one.
 -  Lizzy.

432
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,480
Lizzy, I love you!

433
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,100
- He said, "I love you."
 -  I love you, too.

434
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,790
- Okay.
 -  I'll get ready.

435
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,370
Okay, Lizzy.

436
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,100
- Please wait a minute.
 -  All right.

437
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,260
Who is the unluckiest person that we know of?

438
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,990
How about we call Hong Jin Ho?

439
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,190
- Jin Ho?
 -  Good idea.

440
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,600
- Is he unlucky?
 -  He was never number one.

441
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,670
- He could never be.
 -  Then let's call Jin Ho.

442
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,900
If you think about it, wasn't Gary born unlucky, too?

443
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,900
Gary wasn't born without luck. He was born without looks.

444
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,100
(He was born without looks.)

445
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,570
(He's the ultimate ugly guy.)

446
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,800
Do you know people who are unlucky?

447
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,700
- I know one.
 -  Who?

448
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,990
She's a singer.

449
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,500
But she knows that she is unlucky.

450
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,990
So she chose her agency name as Untus, which sounds lucky.

451
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,000
(So she chose her agency name as Untus, which sounds lucky.)

452
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,360
- She wanted to become lucky.
 -  Really?

453
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,790
- Really.
 -  Really?

454
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,990
It's really Untus.

455
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,090
- She wanted to be lucky?
 -  Yes.

456
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,500
- Who is it, Gary?
 -  It's Wax.

457
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,890
(The singer is Wax.)

458
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,700
- She said she was unlucky.
 -  When I heard...

459
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,990
her name for the first time, I didn't like it.

460
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,400
Wax makes things slippery.

461
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,290
- That's right.
 -  Isn't it?

462
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:21,490
She was known to be so unlucky that Shin Dong Yeob told her...

463
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,600
to change her name to "Waxing".

464
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
(Perhaps "Waxing" could have been a better name.)

465
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,500
He thought the present progressive form would be better.

466
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,190
He thought maybe "Waxing" would bring her more luck.

467
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,890
- Not "Wax", but "Waxing".
 -  Right.

468
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,190
All right. Wait.

469
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,360
(Wax is first on their list.)

470
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,410
Who else is there?

471
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,290
Myung Ho is also unlucky.

472
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,450
Myung Ho is really unlucky.

473
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,360
- I don't usually...
 -  Who is Myung Ho?

474
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,700
- Park Myung Ho.
 -  Park Myung Ho.

475
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,690
- We were in Honeyfamily together.
 -  Myung Ho is...

476
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,360
The moment you see Myung Ho,

477
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,590
you'll realise how unlucky he must have been.

478
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,190
To start off, his strength is even...

479
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,190
weaker than a woman's.

480
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,670
- You're right.
 -  Aren't I?

481
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,500
If he were a vegetable,

482
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,690
he would be a water parsley.

483
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,890
(A water parsley would fit him.)

484
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,090
- Isn't that right?
 -  You're right.

485
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,190
- You're right.
 -  He's light like a water parsley.

486
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,890
He's not like a garlic stem.

487
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,700
No, he's not like a garlic stem.

488
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,790
He's not strong like a leek.

489
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:13,770
But he's weak like a water parsley or bracken.

490
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,480
- You're right.
 -  He's wavering.

491
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,990
- His rapping is also like that.
 -  Yes.

492
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:21,300
Let's call them over and pick the unluckiest person.

493
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,100
I should have brought some money.

494
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,910
I should buy them a meal at least.

495
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,200
(Glancing)

496
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,100
Do you have any money?

497
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
No.

498
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,400
Oh, my.

499
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,460
Think about it.

500
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,390
I'm not just asking for it. I'll pay back.

501
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,290
Think before you say no.

502
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,300
(We've known each other for so long!)

503
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,470
I really don't have any money.

504
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,800
You're like a sheep.

505
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,890
Or a mountain goat.

506
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,390
(He's a fox disguised as a sheep.)

507
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,600
My goodness.

508
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,090
(Jae Seok arrives at the first team member candidate's house.)

509
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,890
(They are nearly done with parking.)

510
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,500
There isn't much space on this side.

511
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,300
What?

512
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,200
Could you park again?

513
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,590
I think the door is going to touch that car.

514
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,090
That's more than enough space to get off.

515
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,500
It's an expensive, foreign car.

516
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,100
You're so high-maintenance. This is why...

517
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,500
we can't engage in a chase.

518
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,290
(The nation's show host is waiting for...)

519
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,700
(one of the unluckiest men.)

520
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,100
Oh, my.

521
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,290
(He's here. Who is he?)

522
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,370
Oh, my.

523
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,600
- Chang Hie.
 -  Yes, Jae Seok.

524
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,000
(The unluckiest man Jae Seok knows is Nam Chang Hie.)

525
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,390
(He's a comedian that is active in both entertainment and dramas.)

526
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,600
Are you sure?

527
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,910
(Is he really unlucky?)

528
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,690
What do you think today's theme is?

529
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,100
- Today?
 -  Yes.

530
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,000
- Teen stars?
 -  What?

531
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,270
I debuted when I was in high school.

532
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,100
I'm sorry.

533
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,290
We're really unlucky.

534
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,440
- Today is about being unlucky.
 -  What?

535
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,910
- Being unlucky?
 -  Yes, being unlucky.

536
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,590
You've been trying so hard.

537
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,790
It's been a while since you debuted. How many years has it been?

538
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,500
- It's been 17 years.
 -  And you live in that house...

539
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,890
- with Sae Ho. And he's doing great.
 -  Yes.

540
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,500
Do you think that you're unlucky?

541
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,600
- I think I am very unlucky.
 -  Give an example.

542
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,800
Another broadcasting company...

543
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,190
offered to cast me for a programme.

544
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,690
I'd be the host that asks questions to the comedians...

545
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,400
as if it were the civil service exams from history.

546
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,690
- But?
 -  But that...

547
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,690
was edited out completely. It wasn't aired at all.

548
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,460
- They stopped shooting suddenly.
 -  Why?

549
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,100
I don't know. Director Kim Tae Ho stopped us.

550
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,590
- Not here.
 -  He wanted to stop shooting.

551
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,990
Not here. It's not because of you.

552
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,090
- It's not because of you.
 -  It's not entirely because of me.

553
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,190
It's not because of you.

554
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,100
The recording didn't go very well that day.

555
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,290
- And so...
 -  Yes.

556
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,690
at the end of the year,

557
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,000
there are awards ceremonies. At an award ceremony,

558
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,590
they told me I would be given an award...

559
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,890
- for being entirely edited out.
 -  Right.

560
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,200
- They invited you.
 -  Yes, they invited me.

561
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,790
But that too was entirely edited out.

562
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,300
(He really has no luck.)

563
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,700
(Nam Chang Hie in Team Jae Seok, the unlucky man who gets edited out)

564
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,360
- There's another fellow.
 -  Who?

565
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,480
(Who?)

566
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,300
- Jung Jung A.
 -  Jung Jung A.

567
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,500
- The icon of anaconda?
 -  That's correct.

568
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,790
- She was doing great.
 -  Yes, she was.

569
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,880
She might have reached her peak, but then she was bitten by an anaconda.

570
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,690
Who would have guessed?

571
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:11,410
Yes. That is very unlucky.

572
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,570
- Yes, Jae Seok.
 -  Jung A.

573
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,600
- Hello.
 -  Where are you?

574
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,410
Me?

575
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,590
Are you with someone?

576
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,290
I'm paying my monthly rent to the owner at the moment.

577
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,090
- I see. Jung A.
 -  Yes.

578
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,480
Could you text me your exact location?

579
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,360
I'll be waiting nearby your house.

580
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,460
(See you in front of the house.)

581
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,910
Jung A is also...

582
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:36,990
(He suddenly feels sorry.)

583
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,500
- Jung A is also unlucky.
 -  Yes.

584
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Do you know anyone...

585
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,690
that is known to be very unlucky?

586
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,400
(His team is not full yet.)

587
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,460
- Lee Wan.
 -  Lee Wan?

588
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,400
- Lee Wan.
 -  Are you saying that...

589
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,490
(What?)

590
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,890
Are you saying that Kim Tae Hee's brother, Lee Wan, is unlucky?

591
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,580
Isn't it unlucky to have been born as Kim Tae Hee's brother?

592
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,990
- Why?
 -  All the men in Korea...

593
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,890
and in the world dream of getting to know Kim Tae Hee.

594
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:04,890
- What? Give me a break.
 -  We have hope.

595
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,590
Do you think you can get to know her?

596
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,790
I could.

597
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,260
We can at least dream of it. You never know.

598
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,360
Oh, my.

599
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,600
But he can't.

600
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,090
- You're right.
 -  Yes.

601
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,290
You're right.

602
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,890
- It's very persuasive.
 -  It is, isn't it?

603
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,900
- He can't go out with his sister.
 -  Right.

604
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,990
(Do you think it's unlucky to live with Kim Tae Hee?)

605
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,100
It can never happen.

606
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,270
Let's go.

607
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,390
But are you sure we aren't intruding?

608
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,790
- Seriously.
 -  Wax may be...

609
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,290
- We're suddenly visiting her.
 -  She goes to a fancy place.

610
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,390
(Who is waiting for Team Seok Jin?)

611
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,500
I think the person's over here.

612
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,500
- Isn't that Wax?
 -  Yes, it is.

613
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,000
Wax.

614
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,700
(A woman is fixing her makeup.)

615
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,100
(Wax is the queen of ballad.)

616
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:55,600
(But Gary says she's unlucky.)

617
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,590
- Over here.
 -  Wax was fixing her makeup.

618
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,700
(Just like the title of her song)

619
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,900
- Wax was fixing her makeup.
 -  She was really fixing her makeup.

620
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,900
Why is your name Wax? It sounds so slippery.

621
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,100
It was all right in the beginning.

622
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,890
- Your song was a hit.
 -  Wax...

623
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,300
was lucky in the beginning. But her middle age luck is bad.

624
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,090
- No.
 -  Why would've you say that?

625
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,390
- The middle period of her career.
 -  Wax.

626
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,080
Do you have a boyfriend?

627
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,490
Not at the moment.

628
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,390
- Your luck with men...
 -  I'm not lucky with men.

629
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,590
You don't? Who's the man that you're closest to?

630
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:25,700
Hong Seok Cheon.

631
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,050
(He is the safest man to be around.)

632
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,090
- Seok Cheon?
 -  Yes.

633
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,500
Her biggest drawback is that she always tries to beat me.

634
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,270
(Laughing)

635
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,890
She's trying to target a lucky person.

636
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,790
That's right. So Gary always tells me...

637
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,970
that I was born unlucky.

638
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,100
He says that.

639
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,490
I want to test her.

640
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,570
All right.

641
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,090
- Let's do a test.
 -  I'm really...

642
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,500
famous for being unlucky.

643
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,700
I have one that I want to pick.

644
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,290
- This one.
 -  I chose that one.

645
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,680
- Is that so?
 -  I wanted that one.

646
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,250
Do you want to switch?

647
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,700
- No.
 -  I chose that one.

648
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,090
I really wanted that one.

649
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,360
- Is that so?
 -  Yes.

650
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,590
I'm easily influenced. Should we switch?

651
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,600
- Should we?
 -  Yes.

652
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,000
Okay.

653
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,790
Was that even worth it?

654
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,300
Is it worth switching between unlucky people?

655
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,100
Flip over after I count to three.

656
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,000
- One, two, three.
 -  Two, three.

657
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,990
(The oldest unluckiest person)

658
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,490
(Born to be unlucky versus the oldest unluckiest person)

659
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:25,000
(Who will be the unluckiest?)

660
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,640
She really picked that.

661
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,890
- You're really unlucky.
 -  She's easily influenced.

662
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,460
- Why did she switch?
 -  She's easily influenced.

663
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,570
(Seok Jin is happy that he won.)

664
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,190
- She even switched.
 -  I told you...

665
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,070
- that she is unlucky.
 -  She beat me.

666
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,380
I acknowledge you.

667
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,890
- I acknowledge you.
 -  I am easily influenced.

668
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,690
If I didn't switch, I would have won.

669
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,000
Of course. Try it with Gary.

670
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,890
Here. Wax, go first.

671
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:49,900
(Now it's a match against lucky Gary.)

672
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
This one.

673
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,000
- I'll pick this one.
 -  Now...

674
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,890
Will you switch?

675
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,190
- Do you want to switch?
 -  I won't switch this time.

676
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,300
She's so stubborn with me.

677
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,300
- I want to beat Gary.
 -  One, two, three.

678
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,400
(Gary wins.)

679
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,470
(Wax loses two times in a row.)

680
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,090
She can't beat me!

681
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:12,290
- She can't.
 -  She didn't switch this time.

682
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,460
(Maybe she was really born unlucky.)

683
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,000
- You'd have won if you switched.
 -  Yes, you're right.

684
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,090
We've come to the right person.

685
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,100
(Will she be the rising unluckiest person?)

686
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,090
I'll do it.

687
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,190
- Each hold one.
 -  We each have to pick one.

688
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,290
And show it.

689
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,990
(Only one of the spoons is unlucky.)

690
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,390
- Pick one.
 -  I want this one. This one.

691
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,690
That one? Are you sure?

692
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,390
- Do you want to switch?
 -  No, I won't.

693
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,000
- Do you not want to?
 -  I will go with my first choice.

694
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,590
(She picks one without delay.)

695
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,690
- Oh, my.
 -  It's the unlucky one.

696
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,100
(Oh, my.)

697
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,400
- Wow. I have goosebumps.
 -  I told you.

698
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,470
- Me, too.
 -  I've got goosebumps.

699
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,500
She's always stubborn with me, but ends up being unlucky.

700
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,200
How could she pick this?

701
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,290
- There's no need to carry on.
 -  This is enough.

702
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,490
You're the winner.

703
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,600
- You're definitely a top candidate.
 -  This doesn't make me...

704
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,000
feel that great.

705
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,190
Look here.

706
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,260
There were two of these.

707
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,870
(A true unlucky person avoids the two R spoons.)

708
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:00,260
I will use up all my unlucky energy in Running Man today.

709
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,990
- Great.
 -  Use up all your unlucky energy.

710
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,560
- Use it all up and start fresh.
 -  That's great.

711
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,070
- We would like to cast you.
 -  Yes.

712
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,060
- Right, we have no choice.
 -  You're very unlucky.

713
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,460
(Am I doing it right?)

714
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,960
Should I feel happy?

715
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,070
(Wax in Team Seok Jin, she gets unluckier when with Gary.)

716
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,470
I think she is in a coffee shop near here.

717
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,760
- There she is.
 -  She said she'll be waiting there.

718
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,860
- There she is.
 -  She is Jung A.

719
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,030
She intentionally dressed that way, didn't she?

720
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,750
She hasn't changed at all.

721
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,660
Where are you going?

722
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,290
I was waiting for a driver because my car broke down.

723
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,930
- Is that so?
 -  Yes.

724
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,910
I am going to play badminton with Lee Moon Se tonight.

725
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,160
Why did you bring your racquet? You will play at night, won't you?

726
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,170
Because I have nothing to do before that.

727
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,150
I came out early.

728
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,430
I live right there.

729
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,660
- Where?
 -  Right beside the red building.

730
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,460
- Really?
 -  Yes.

731
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,840
Why don't you come over to my place?

732
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,930
(What did you just say?)

733
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,940
Why not?

734
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,570
The balcony at my place is pretty big.

735
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,200
- Okay. Let's go then.
 -  Let's go in.

736
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:05,300
(Jung Jung A in Team Jae Seok, first actress to be bitten by an anaconda)

737
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,420
- You have a puppy.
 -  Yes.

738
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,760
But you don't seem to hold her in your arms often.

739
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,550
Right. I don't hold her in my arms at all.

740
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,770
That's why...

741
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,570
Although I don't keep a puppy at all,

742
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,740
she seems to feel comfortable in my arms.

743
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,460
She really does.

744
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,040
I think she will come with you to your place if you ask her so.

745
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,660
Right.

746
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,460
Others might think you've been here before.

747
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,650
Right.

748
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,930
She likes you so much.

749
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,230
Gosh.

750
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,760
Many will find this suspicious.

751
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,960
- True.
 -  You live near here.

752
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,670
- Right.
 -  We've met a few times...

753
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,070
before you got married.

754
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,460
I used to give you rides to the video rental shop.

755
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,390
Yes, you did. When we used to belong to the same agency,

756
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,460
- she gave me rides to the shop.
 -  I see.

757
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,560
- She dropped me at the shop.
 -  Okay.

758
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,740
I asked him what he rented, but he never let me know.

759
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,960
He put the video tapes inside a plastic bag and never showed me.

760
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,130
- He always had a plastic bag...
 -  I didn't want to drop the tapes.

761
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:58,750
- Oh, you didn't want to drop them.
 -  Right.

762
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,160
Anyway, we have a problem.

763
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,760
We need two more members in our team.

764
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,190
Can you contact Lee Wan now?

765
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,390
- Let me call him now.
 -  Lee Wan?

766
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,860
- Yes, please call him.
 -  Lee Wan?

767
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,330
Yes, Lee Wan. It sounds promising.

768
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,760
Do you mean the brother of Kim Tae Hee?

769
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,860
Do you personally know him?

770
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,560
I'm a bit worried. He might have changed his phone number.

771
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,060
But let me call Wan.

772
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,270
- Is he younger than you?
 -  Yes, one year younger.

773
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,660
(Chang Hie tries to contact Lee Wan.)

774
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,670
Hello?

775
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,040
Wan.

776
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:30,040
- It has been a long time.
 -  Hello, it's Chang Hie.

777
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,060
- Of course, I know it's you.
 -  Hey.

778
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:37,360
Thank you for answering my call gladly. Here is my bow.

779
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,460
(Chang Hie becomes polite.)

780
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,470
I...

781
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,440
- Why would you bow to me.
 -  I miss you.

782
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,570
Where are you now, Wan?

783
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,070
- I am home.
 -  I see.

784
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,970
- Let me get someone on the phone.
 -  Here. Hello?

785
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,170
- Hello?
 -  This is Yu Jae Seok.

786
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,400
Oh, hi.

787
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,340
That is exactly how I felt.

788
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:03,460
I can see how nervous you are. Please relax.

789
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,640
Calm down and listen to me, please.

790
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,440
- I...
 -  It's because you're on the line.

791
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,470
(Getting a random call from Jae Seok)

792
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,830
- Chang Hie said...
 -  Yes.

793
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,970
you're very unlucky.

794
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,670
- Me?
 -  Yes.

795
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,240
- Please tell him why he is unlucky.
 -  Okay.

796
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,940
Wan, you're unlucky...

797
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,560
because you can never see Tae Hee as a woman while other guys can.

798
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,570
Right?

799
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,470
I see.

800
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,660
- That is why you're unlucky.
 -  Yes, you're unlucky.

801
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,340
(Wan, you are not lucky.)

802
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:37,640
Well, I never thought Tae Hee was pretty.

803
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,120
- That's nonsense.
 -  No way!

804
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,830
You will be surprised when you meet my cousin.

805
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,860
(You'd know that Tae Hee is pretty if you meet my cousin.)

806
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,670
You'd better meet my female friends.

807
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,140
My goodness.

808
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,370
Don't you want to test yourself if you're lucky or unlucky?

809
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,540
Now it sounds tempting though.

810
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,930
(We've got you!)

811
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,170
Then, Wan.

812
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,300
- Yes?
 -  We should meet first.

813
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,060
Will you come to my place?

814
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,070
Yes, we will pick you up near your place.

815
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,860
Well, will I be okay?

816
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,140
Yes, you'll be okay.

817
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,810
It will be okay.

818
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,970
Don't worry.

819
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,670
Okay. Today, we'll meet him.

820
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,470
- Lee Wan!
 -  Thank you, Wan.

821
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,840
- Thank you. See you soon.
 -  Thank you.

822
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,160
- All right.
 -  We finally got him.

823
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,670
- There's one more to call.
 -  Who?

824
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,570
- Kang Hyun Soo.
 -  Oh, I know Hyun Soo.

825
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,660
You mean V.One?

826
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,670
(Do you remember Kang Hyun Soo?)

827
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,070
It's over now.

828
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,970
- I don't care any more.
 -  Stop shooting. He said it's over.

829
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:43,170
Move the lighting and microphones to this side. He doesn't care now.

830
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,270
(Are we meeting the Kang Hyun Soo from 15 years ago?)

831
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,160
I know Hyun Soo. He is a friend of mine.

832
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,670
Let's call Hyun Soo then.

833
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,650
He's busy running a lot of business, but they don't work out.

834
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,160
Doesn't he have an event agency?

835
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,260
- It's not doing well.
 -  Hello?

836
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,960
- Hyun Soo.
 -  Yes, Jae Seok.

837
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,970
Where are you now?

838
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:03,020
I'm on my way to replace my car tires to new ones.

839
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,360
Why is this funny?

840
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,430
This unlucky guy will change the tires today.

841
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,060
- So...
 -  What happened?

842
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,470
So you're free today.

843
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,070
- Sorry?
 -  You're free today, right?

844
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:16,140
- I'll replace my tires first,
 -  Yes.

845
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:21,070
and my car's check engine light is on.

846
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,760
So I have to get it checked.

847
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,970
Hyun Soo, do you know Jung A?

848
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,170
- Jung A?
 -  Yes.

849
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,130
Park Jung A?

850
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,200
(Do you mean Park Jung A?)

851
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,570
Jung A said you're her friend.

852
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,390
I only know Jung Jung A and Park Jung A.

853
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,670
I meant Jung Jung A.

854
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,560
Yes, she is a good friend of mine.

855
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,470
Can you join us for shooting today?

856
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,570
- Well...
 -  Yes?

857
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,470
- I don't look good now.
 -  It's okay. We all look bad today.

858
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:51,570
- I look even sick today.
 -  I look much worse than you.

859
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,330
- Then, okay.
 -  We became five easily.

860
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,670
I feel like I'm running an employment centre.

861
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,770
It just happened.

862
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,840
- Is it here?
 -  I think so.

863
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,470
Let's call her.

864
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,950
Let me see. Oh, this building must be right.

865
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,360
- Hi.
 -  It's Lizzy.

866
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,870
- Right.
 -  Lizzy!

867
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,460
Lizzy!

868
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,860
(It's nice meeting you, Lizzy.)

869
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,570
Lizzy!

870
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,460
- Lizzy.
 -  Lizzy.

871
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,660
- You're here.
 -  Gosh.

872
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,030
- Lizzy.
 -  Hi.

873
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,400
(We've met our unlucky original member in 5 years.)

874
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,270
(A tear-jerking moment to meet everyone)

875
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,460
(She was a high schooler when we first met her.)

876
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,470
What?

877
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,190
- Hello.
 -  Hello!

878
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,660
(Lizzy was with us when Running Man started 5 years go.)

879
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,760
(And now you're our guest.)

880
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,390
What happened?

881
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,860
(And now you're our guest.)

882
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,060
Jin Ho is here, too.

883
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,640
- Hello.
 -  Hi.

884
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,290
Are you also an unsuccessful person?

885
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,760
- No.
 -  No, we're not unsuccessful.

886
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,860
Lizzy, it's not unsuccessful.

887
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,460
- It's unlucky.
 -  It's unlucky.

888
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,060
- I got it now.
 -  We're not unsuccessful.

889
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,390
- You got it?
 -  Yes.

890
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,010
Hello.

891
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:57,870
(Lizzy in Team Kwang Soo, the original member of Running Man)

892
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,760
I am so happy to be with you here, Lizzy.

893
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,160
- Right.
 -  Long time no see, Lizzy.

894
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,430
Old memories come to my mind.

895
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,140
What makes you the happiest nowadays?

896
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,360
I feel happy at night.

897
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,130
- Why?
 -  Because I can sleep at night.

898
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,930
- I see.
 -  I have nothing to do...

899
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:15,830
- Poor Lizzy.
 -  even if I wake up early.

900
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,430
Please don't say that, Lizzy.

901
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,760
- I feel like crying.
 -  Haha, you should apologise to her.

902
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,070
I am sorry, Lizzy.

903
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,460
- It's okay.
 -  It's my fault.

904
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,660
(Poor Lizzy, you're having a dire time.)

905
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,560
Twinkle, twinkle

906
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,270
- Twinkle, twinkle
 -  Why are you singing suddenly?

907
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:31,130
- She scared me.
 -  Looking at the stars

908
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,110
Is this a sad song?

909
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,020
I just realised that it is a sad song.

910
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,760
- Gosh.
 -  I need to drink now.

911
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,760
- My goodness.
 -  It's so sad.

912
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,400
Lizzy, I love you.

913
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,670
Lizzy, I am sorry.

914
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,030
That's what love is

915
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,640
What am I doing?

916
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,860
Gosh.

917
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,060
(At this rate, she could easily be the winner.)

918
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,240
- Gosh.
 -  Oh, Lizzy.

919
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,640
(Let's take a look at what Seok Jin's team is up to.)

920
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,030
You should hide now.

921
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,440
Please hide now.

922
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,860
Myung Ho doesn't know anything now.

923
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,040
We called him all of a sudden.

924
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:08,360
He just woke up five minutes ago. He will come out, knowing nothing...

925
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,060
because we told him to do so.

926
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,460
So we will hide our cameras...

927
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,570
and our name tags.

928
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,770
I can't wait to meet him.

929
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,430
- Have you met him before?
 -  No, not even once.

930
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,570
Myung Ho is here.

931
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,670
- Is he? Where?
 -  There.

932
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,450
Where is he?

933
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:25,670
- Gary.
 -  Myung Ho!

934
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:32,460
(Park Myung Ho was the leader of legendary Honeyfamily.)

935
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,860
(Charismatic Park Myung Ho is coming.)

936
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,570
Gosh.

937
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,870
(Who are you?)

938
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,300
(Looking sloppy)

939
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,470
Hello, Myung Ho.

940
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,960
Myung Ho, look at your legs.

941
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,870
Why are your legs so skinny?

942
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,840
They look so weak.

943
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,060
He rapped at my wife's birthday party.

944
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,060
Please rap for us now. Go!

945
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,760
(Please show us how you rapped at the birthday party.)

946
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,190
(Let's see what this legendary rapper showed at the party.)

947
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,260
Myung Ho is here

948
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,600
He came here with hopes of finding his dreams

949
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:15,370
(Why would he look for his dreams at Seok Jin's wife's party?)

950
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,810
- It is so funny.
 -  Goodness.

951
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:22,560
He never says no when people ask him to rap.

952
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,060
- Right.
 -  Let's take him now.

953
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,430
How much do you weigh?

954
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:30,370
I used to weigh 62kg, but after I got conned...

955
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,060
- He got conned.
 -  I'm not lying.

956
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,830
- We need someone like you.
 -  Gosh.

957
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:37,560
We've been looking for someone just like you.

958
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,760
You're a very competent candidate today.

959
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,960
Do you always carry water with you?

960
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,960
- Oh, water.
 -  I have a serious panic disorder.

961
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,190
(I have a serious panic disorder.)

962
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:47,060
(Busker with panic disorder?)

963
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,070
He always says that he suffers from panic disorder.

964
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,430
(We want to know who this rapper really is.)

965
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,860
I've known Gary since I was 19.

966
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,960
I used to like straightforward rapping style.

967
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,660
But Myung Ho told me to use nasal sound when I rap.

968
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,360
Like this. He kept telling me to do so.

969
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,240
No, it's the swing.

970
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,590
With Gary and Gary and I

971
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:09,430
It had the swing.

972
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,890
- Okay.
 -  Do you really have panic disorder?

973
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,430
Yes. I am still dizzy.

974
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,730
(He's dizzy because of his panic disorder.)

975
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,330
I am serious.

976
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,880
Do you watch Running Man?

977
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,440
Honestly, I don't own a TV.

978
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,070
(He doesn't own a TV.)

979
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,240
Poor him.

980
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,590
Let's win and...

981
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:29,210
- use the gold to buy him a TV.
 -  Let's buy him a TV.

982
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,830
He fits perfectly into today's special.

983
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,090
I can't even be compared to him.

984
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,990
- His unluckiness is another level.
 -  Right. His level of unluckiness...

985
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,440
- is on another scale.
 -  Let's test him.

986
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,830
- You can test him.
 -  I can do it.

987
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:42,070
- I think I'll pick "unlucky".
 -  There are two cards.

988
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,340
Honestly, I hope he will pick the "lucky" card.

989
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,540
- Me too.
 -  But...

990
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,090
- I feel so sad today.
 -  I hope I pick the "lucky" card.

991
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,530
- Today, it's...
 -  Pick one card, Myung Ho.

992
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,690
- Pick one card.
 -  It's darkness.

993
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,890
Things are not working out for me.

994
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:54,970
- Pick one.
 -  Gosh...

995
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,840
- You chose that?
 -  Yes.

996
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,440
Check it.

997
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,690
Gosh...

998
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,810
(He picks the "unlucky" card.)

999
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,890
I shouldn't be laughing.

1000
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,240
I am right-handed, so I was going to pick the right one.

1001
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,740
But I thought I would just go with the left one.

1002
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,130
I won't do it.

1003
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,630
I am going to cry.

1004
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,830
(He's about to break into tears.)

1005
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,990
(He's probably the unluckiest person ever.)

1006
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,630
Gosh, we have no choice...

1007
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,020
but to cast you. Great.

1008
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,540
I cannot not cast him.

1009
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,240
(Park Myung Ho in Team Seok Jin, the unlucky hip hop musician)

1010
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,340
- It's Mikey!
 -  Isn't he the one?

1011
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,530
- Yes.
 -  Mikey!

1012
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:34,890
He's not the Mikey you used to know, right?

1013
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,820
I think I should resign and rest today.

1014
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,330
But you don't have any work.

1015
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,960
- Right. I don't have any work.
 -  You should come with us.

1016
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,640
- You can ride the crew's car.
 -  That's okay, right?

1017
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,240
Hyun Soo.

1018
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,170
Nothing too bad happened, right?

1019
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,740
- I need to look for a place.
 -  Is that so?

1020
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,720
So your lease contract has expired.

1021
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,240
Actually, I have one year to go.

1022
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,530
(He still has a year left in his lease contract.)

1023
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,690
(So why are you looking for a place?)

1024
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,330
We need to give him the team uniform first.

1025
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:58,160
(He gets the team uniform.)

1026
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,200
Give me an extra large size.

1027
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,840
Hey, you see...

1028
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,940
I'm not selling clothes right now.

1029
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,940
- He's not selling clothes.
 -  Look.

1030
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,330
I'm sorry, Hyun Soo, but I am not selling clothes.

1031
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,940
(Team Jae Seok casts Kang Hyun Soo.)

1032
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,530
It's like we are fans waiting in front of a celebrity's house.

1033
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:18,230
Where did Hyun Soo go?

1034
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,940
He's in the car. He's getting changed.

1035
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,600
- That looks like him.
 -  You should join us.

1036
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,510
It's Hyun Soo.

1037
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,830
- Hyun Soo!
 -  Yes.

1038
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,060
(Why did he go past us?)

1039
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,430
- He got changed.
 -  Where are you going?

1040
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:31,180
They told me to park my car and join you.

1041
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,590
This is Lee Wan's place. Where are you going?

1042
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,880
Tell us where you are going.

1043
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,330
I thought you were in the shoot.

1044
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:37,600
He thought we were in the shoot.

1045
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,240
There... There he is. He's out.

1046
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,330
- He's coming.
 -  He's Wan.

1047
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,430
- Right?
 -  It's Wan.

1048
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:46,170
(Finally, Kim Tae Hee's brother, handsome Lee Wan is coming.)

1049
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,900
There he is.

1050
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,630
- He's out.
 -  He's so handsome.

1051
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,030
- Hyun Soo, hurry and move your car.
 -  I can see that from afar.

1052
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,320
(Jae Seok rushes Hyun Soo to move his car.)

1053
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,420
- Move your car!
 -  Move your car!

1054
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,690
- Stop blocking our view!
 -  Get out of the way!

1055
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,170
- Move. Move your car, Hyun Soo.
 -  What is he doing?

1056
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,590
- Gosh...
 -  Why would you go there?

1057
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,690
Hyun Soo.

1058
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:04,590
(Is he doing this out of jealousy?)

1059
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,690
Gosh...

1060
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:08,240
It's good that we chose him. Kwang Soo's role is perfect for him.

1061
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,930
Gosh, look at Wan.

1062
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,740
Hello!

1063
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,180
He's unbelievably handsome.

1064
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,740
- Hello.
 -  Hello, Wan.

1065
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,130
- Goodness.
 -  He's so handsome.

1066
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,710
Hello.

1067
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,810
It's been a while.

1068
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,060
- Gosh...
 -  He's like a work of art.

1069
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,240
Wan, you...

1070
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,060
- You just came out of the house.
 -  I took a shower.

1071
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,630
- He washed his hair.
 -  He washed his hair and came out.

1072
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,730
I can smell the shampoo.

1073
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:32,830
But he looks too good.

1074
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,030
(He just took a shower, but he looks as if he went to a salon.)

1075
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,440
Tae Hee is calling me right now.

1076
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,010
- Really?
 -  It says "My sister".

1077
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,070
Really?

1078
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,840
Hello?

1079
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,170
Yes.

1080
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,540
- His sister is Kim Tae Hee.
 -  What?

1081
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,910
His sister is Kim Tae Hee.

1082
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,610
Can you ask her this question?

1083
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,510
Hold on. I will put him on the phone.

1084
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,440
Someone has a question for you.

1085
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,190
(He gives his phone to Jae Seok.)

1086
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,340
Hello?

1087
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,440
- Hello?
 -  Tae Hee.

1088
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,230
I am Yu Jae Seok.

1089
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,440
(Jae Seok introduces himself to Tae Hee.)

1090
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,730
Yes, hello.

1091
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,240
Oh gosh!

1092
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,120
I can't believe it!

1093
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,590
- It's my luckiest day!
 -  It really is his luckiest day.

1094
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,590
It's the luckiest day for me!

1095
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,530
No, it's the luckiest day for me.

1096
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,640
- How...
 -  I can't believe it!

1097
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,630
I really can't believe it.

1098
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:21,410
- Today, we are...
 -  Yes.

1099
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:24,080
You are not on a shoot, are you?

1100
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,190
We are on a shoot.

1101
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,340
(They are shooting Running Man.)

1102
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,630
What are you shooting?

1103
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:30,340
We are shooting Running Man.

1104
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,010
- Is that right? Oh dear!
 -  I wanted to ask you something.

1105
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:37,340
Today's a special about unlucky people.

1106
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,690
(It's a special about unlucky people.)

1107
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,330
- And...
 -  Yes.

1108
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:43,170
Chang Hie said Wan is unlucky.

1109
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,040
He's unlucky because he cannot be your lover in this life.

1110
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,630
- In that sense, he's unlucky.
 -  I see.

1111
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:53,800
Thankfully, he agreed to join us today.

1112
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,930
I see.

1113
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:57,230
So he just came out, and...

1114
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,430
when he was about to leave with us, his sister called him.

1115
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,590
And it turns out his sister is Kim Tae Hee.

1116
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:02,220
(It just so happens that his sister is Kim Tae Hee.)

1117
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,060
I really didn't know. He never told me he's going on Running Man.

1118
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,000
Gosh...

1119
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,530
- By the way.
 -  Yes.

1120
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,940
Are you usually lucky or unlucky?

1121
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,540
I think...

1122
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,780
I think...

1123
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:18,800
- I think I am very lucky.
 -  Is that so?

1124
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,690
Of course. I consider myself lucky.

1125
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:23,160
If you were unlucky, we were going to fetch you right now.

1126
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,230
(If she was unlucky, they were going to get her as a team member.)

1127
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,190
- Anyway,
 -  Please invite me next time.

1128
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,240
It was so nice to talk to you, Tae Hee.

1129
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:31,930
It was nice to talk to you, too.

1130
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,430
Thank you for letting me talk to you unexpectedly.

1131
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:38,170
Tae Hee, you are the best.

1132
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:43,100
You are our angel.

1133
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,330
Thank you so much. I hope to see you next time...

1134
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,340
- on a show.
 -  Right.

1135
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,640
Okay. Thank you.

1136
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,330
Thank you.

1137
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,580
Thank you!

1138
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,830
Wait.

1139
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:55,840
I don't think I will be able to walk the dog.

1140
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,590
We were supposed to walk the dog together.

1141
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:00,100
- Gosh...
 -  How beautiful would that be!

1142
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,740
You are so great.

1143
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,840
You walk the dog like this?

1144
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,130
With your hair like that?

1145
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,240
(Like this?)

1146
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,840
Your sister is Kim Tae Hee.

1147
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,700
You will walk the dog with her with that hair?

1148
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,160
- Isn't that too much?
 -  Really?

1149
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,620
Wouldn't that be too beautiful?

1150
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,230
Gosh, Wan. Thank you.

1151
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,810
I am sorry, Hyun Soo.

1152
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,730
- You're here.
 -  He just came.

1153
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,630
(When did you come?)

1154
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,810
I'm a bad guy.

1155
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,690
- For a moment,
 -  Don't hit yourself.

1156
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,330
if Tae Hee said she was unlucky,

1157
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,900
I was going to give her your place.

1158
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,340
I am sorry.

1159
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,330
- You were going to send him home.
 -  I am sorry.

1160
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,440
We can shoot a commercial together if you are sorry.

1161
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:38,840
I am sorry.

1162
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:43,050
Anyway, let's go with Wan.

1163
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,230
I am so thankful that Wan agreed to join us.

1164
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,590
- It's no problem.
 -  Thanks.

1165
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,840
- Thank you.
 -  It's not easy.

1166
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:51,160
All right.

1167
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,530
(Team Jae Seok is moving to the final destination, Mokdong.)

1168
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,310
All the unlucky people are here.

1169
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,440
You know what I was jealous about him?

1170
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,170
- His sister.
 -  His sister.

1171
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,440
It said "My sister" on his phone.

1172
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,930
(Kim Tae Hee is saved on his phone as "My sister")

1173
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:05,900
In that moment, I felt so sorry to my brothers.

1174
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,540
I have two little brothers, and they don't tell people about me.

1175
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,070
Hyun Soo, is your sister beautiful, too?

1176
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,240
- My sister is in the province.
 -  Okay.

1177
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,440
- She stays with my parents.
 -  Okay.

1178
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,190
- And she works.
 -  I didn't ask about her life.

1179
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,330
(He asked if she's beautiful!)

1180
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,090
- That's not what I asked.
 -  Right.

1181
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:29,240
Right. So please answer my question.

1182
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,340
- Chang Hie, do you have siblings?
 -  I have an elder brother.

1183
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,810
- I see.
 -  Right.

1184
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:36,240
- You won't ask more questions?
 -  What?

1185
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:37,970
What should I ask about?

1186
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,590
- You could ask about him.
 -  There is nothing...

1187
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:41,640
There is nothing to ask.

1188
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,730
There's nothing to ask.

1189
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,070
Siblings look alike.

1190
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,070
- How about you?
 -  I have two little sisters.

1191
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,430
(He feels guilty.)

1192
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,890
- You have 2 sisters?
 -  I have 2 little sisters.

1193
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,140
- Okay.
 -  Are they beautiful?

1194
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,220
Don't ask.

1195
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,440
They are happy.

1196
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,430
(They are happy.)

1197
00:43:58,430 --> 00:43:59,640
Appearance is not important.

1198
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,440
- I...
 -  Gosh, Wan.

1199
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,990
I envy Wan.

1200
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:05,530
(Everyone is jealous of Wan.)

1201
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:07,070
- But you are married.
 -  I know.

1202
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,200
How nice is it? His sister is Kim Tae Hee.

1203
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,640
- His sister is Kim Tae Hee.
 -  It's very nice.

1204
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:15,440
- When I was in school,
 -  Yes.

1205
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,240
I was never beaten up by upperclass students.

1206
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,340
All the school gang leaders liked my sister.

1207
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,130
That's great.

1208
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:25,130
(Thanks to his beautiful sister, he had a comfortable school life.)

1209
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,830
But when she sees Wan,

1210
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,310
she must be proud that...

1211
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,930
- her brother is so handsome.
 -  Right. Wan is handsome.

1212
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:32,190
- And his sister is beautiful.
 -  They are both good-looking.

1213
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,530
- They must be happy.
 -  They must be proud.

1214
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:34,690
Gosh...

1215
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:36,340
She must be proud of her handsome little brother.

1216
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,800
He's got this nice hair that drapes down.

1217
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,910
And he walks the dog like that.

1218
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:42,940
- He's like Prince Charming.
 -  Yes. It's charming.

1219
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,340
(At 5pm, everyone arrives at the final stage.)

1220
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,930
- We don't need to take anything?
 -  Of course.

1221
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:52,080
Let's get off.

1222
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,640
- Today, the unlucky person wins.
 -  That's right.

1223
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,160
(The unluckiest celebrities will compete against each other.)

1224
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,730
(Whenever they make a decision, things will burst, break and crush.)

1225
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:02,890
You can't get eliminated now.

1226
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:06,110
(Who will be the first unluckiest person?)

1227
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,170
(Unlucky)

1228
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,230
- The First Unluckiest Festival.
 -  What?

1229
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:13,630
- It's for the unlucky people.
 -  That's right.

1230
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:14,890
We are all gathered here for the festival.

1231
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:17,630
- We will do a simple test.
 -  Okay.

1232
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:20,410
- Of course.
 -  Why did you put Jin Ho here?

1233
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:21,590
- How can you treat him so badly?
 -  What do you mean?

1234
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:23,430
He chose to sit there.

1235
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,790
He chose to sit there? What do you mean?

1236
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:26,020
- That's not it.
 -  Jae Seok.

1237
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,230
- Jin Ho is...
 -  Yes.

1238
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:30,330
- pretty unlucky, too.
 -  Right.

1239
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:32,520
- But he looked at other people,
 -  They are too unlucky.

1240
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,890
- and he gave up.
 -  He gave up.

1241
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:35,430
- He dropped out.
 -  Is that right?

1242
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:36,830
- Now that I'm here,
 -  Yes.

1243
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:38,630
I've realised how happy I am.

1244
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:39,830
(He realised how happy he is.)

1245
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:40,960
- He had a healing experience.
 -  It made him happy.

1246
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,790
He came here, and he realised how happy he is.

1247
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:46,160
- It turns out I'm a happy person.
 -  You can't complain.

1248
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,530
- Everyone.
 -  It's crazy.

1249
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:49,130
Let's do a simple verification.

1250
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:51,240
- Why is Lizzy here?
 -  Jae Seok!

1251
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,890
- You know why.
 -  You know why I am here!

1252
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:56,700
- I am sorry.
 -  I got fired.

1253
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,340
Lizzy, I am sorry.

1254
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,630
- Okay.
 -  She made Nana...

1255
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:02,990
to be picked as the world's most beautiful girl.

1256
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:04,590
- Lizzy did that?
 -  She did that.

1257
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,670
- She brings good luck.
 -  She does.

1258
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,390
Why do I never seem to go up?

1259
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,200
- What do you mean?
 -  Why am I in the same place?

1260
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,660
Lizzy.

1261
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,490
- Don't say that.
 -  Lizzy.

1262
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:16,930
You did seem to talk a bunch of random things.

1263
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:18,560
- It's been too long.
 -  I'm okay.

1264
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,740
She must be nervous.

1265
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,100
Mikey, aren't things picking up for you?

1266
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,490
You recently had a concert.

1267
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,760
It ended six days ago.

1268
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,500
- Six days ago?
 -  I've been home ever since.

1269
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,360
- Ever since the concert?
 -  Yes.

1270
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,390
- To tell you the truth,
 -  That's too bad.

1271
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:33,200
I've always wanted to be on Running Man.

1272
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,690
- Really?
 -  He told me all the time.

1273
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:37,460
But to be on television, I should wash myself.

1274
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,400
- Of course.
 -  But I don't have hot water.

1275
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,190
- It's true.
 -  He uses hot water next door.

1276
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:44,340
That was why he smelled like an old man.

1277
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,730
Don't be too specific.

1278
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:47,990
- Please, don't.
 -  When I met him...

1279
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:49,190
Don't describe in detail.

1280
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:50,990
I hugged him, and he smelled like an old man.

1281
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:52,100
Please stop.

1282
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,100
Chang Hie is on my team.

1283
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,480
He was the first person I tried to invite.

1284
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,690
Of course.

1285
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,690
- He's living with Sae Ho.
 -  That's right.

1286
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:02,090
Aren't you living at Sae Ho's apartment?

1287
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,090
It's not that I'm living at his apartment.

1288
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:05,290
I pay rent, too.

1289
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:06,460
- Oh, really?
 -  Of course.

1290
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:07,590
We're sharing the apartment.

1291
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:09,600
- They're sharing it.
 -  Are you sure?

1292
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,660
- Isn't it just Sae Ho's apartment?
 -  They're sharing the apartment.

1293
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,090
- Are you sharing the apartment?
 -  Yes.

1294
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:15,860
- It's not his apartment.
 -  Is it a shared apartment?

1295
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,090
Can't you show that to us?

1296
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:18,390
- What do you mean?
 -  The movie, "Ip Man".

1297
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:20,490
- Do you mean actor Donnie Yen?
 -  Yes.

1298
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:22,190
- Oh, Donnie Yen.
 -  Show us.

1299
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:24,490
Actually, he has mimicked Donnie Yen...

1300
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:25,830
on many other programmes.

1301
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:26,960
(He has mimicked Donnie Yen on many other programmes.)

1302
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,080
- He does it well.
 -  But it was always cut out.

1303
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,390
- This is Donnie Yen from "Ip Man".
 -  Donnie Yen.

1304
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,200
(Donnie Yen is a star who represents China.)

1305
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,930
- Doesn't he look just like him?
 -  That's hilarious.

1306
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:37,090
(He looks exactly like the actor.)

1307
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:39,100
It's Donnie Yen.

1308
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,490
He looks exactly like him.

1309
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:43,090
Are you sure you're not Donnie Yen?

1310
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:44,590
- You look exactly like him.
 -  He's amazing.

1311
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:47,490
- You look exactly like him.
 -  You really do.

1312
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,590
Chang Hie was the first person I met today.

1313
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:51,860
- Chang Hie invited Lee Wan.
 -  Really?

1314
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:54,790
- We...
 -  Why is Wan here?

1315
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,190
Chang Hie called Wan after three years.

1316
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:59,460
I was very happy to hear from him.

1317
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,360
The thing is...

1318
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,590
I'm a positive person.

1319
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,860
I've always considered myself lucky. But Chang Hie...

1320
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,780
tried to convince me that I'm unlucky.

1321
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,430
He suggested I should...

1322
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:12,100
- test my luck here today.
 -  I agree.

1323
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,660
That's why I'm here.

1324
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,930
He was actually going to... Do you know who his sister is?

1325
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,090
Of course.

1326
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:18,730
- His sister?
 -  Do you know who she is?

1327
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:22,290
Actually, he was going to...

1328
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:25,000
walk his dog with her this evening.

1329
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,400
Shouldn't we be there instead?

1330
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,100
- We shouldn't be here now.
 -  I can go.

1331
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:31,090
- I could get a dog right now.
 -  Do you see?

1332
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:32,190
I'll go get a dog now.

1333
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:34,860
Look at his hairstyle.

1334
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,590
He was going to walk his dog in that hairstyle.

1335
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:38,390
- We should have seen that instead.
 -  I should've gone.

1336
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,770
He was going to walk his dog in that hairstyle.

1337
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,100
- But he came here instead.
 -  Exactly.

1338
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,290
But his sister is Kim Tae Hee.

1339
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,490
How can he be unlucky?

1340
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:49,590
But Wan doesn't think so.

1341
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:51,190
People say...

1342
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:53,000
my sister is pretty,

1343
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,100
but I don't understand.

1344
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,390
(He doesn't understand why people say Kim Tae Hee is pretty.)

1345
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:59,090
- He doesn't understand.
 -  I can't believe that.

1346
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:00,660
Kwang Soo! He's not talking about your sister.

1347
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,900
My sister looks exactly like me!

1348
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:04,460
She's the long-haired version of me.

1349
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:06,290
Go back to your seat.

1350
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:08,290
- Anyway...
 -  My sister has a moustache!

1351
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:09,760
(His sister is growing a moustache.)

1352
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,100
She's a girl, but she has a moustache.

1353
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,810
Stop.

1354
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:14,100
Calm down.

1355
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,830
- Come on.
 -  That's why.

1356
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:18,790
- I can't believe that.
 -  That's why he's unlucky.

1357
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,990
- We could say he's unlucky.
 -  I understand.

1358
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:22,830
Also, we have Jung A here.

1359
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:24,790
Everyone knows her.

1360
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:26,930
She's also known as the Anaconda Lady.

1361
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:28,200
(Anaconda Lady)

1362
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,100
She's the only lady who got bitten by an anaconda.

1363
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,990
Isn't she the only one in Korea?

1364
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:33,090
That's right.

1365
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:34,770
Where did you get bitten?

1366
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,450
It bit my arm.

1367
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:40,090
I thought it would rip my arm off.

1368
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:41,100
It could.

1369
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,890
I managed to pull my arm out,

1370
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:44,960
but its teeth got stuck in my arm.

1371
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,240
Its teeth must've been decayed.

1372
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,860
- What?
 -  What is he saying?

1373
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,800
That must be why they came off.

1374
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,490
Anacondas can have cavities, too.

1375
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,090
A tooth doesn't have to be decayed to come out.

1376
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:58,090
- Are you sure?
 -  Yes.

1377
00:49:58,090 --> 00:49:59,190
Would you like to try?

1378
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:00,680
(Should I pull out one of your teeth?)

1379
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,390
What are you talking about?

1380
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:04,560
- Why would you pull his tooth out?
 -  Goodness.

1381
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,930
(Seok Jin's teeth are on the line.)

1382
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:07,390
- He was curious.
 -  Why?

1383
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:08,860
He wants to see.

1384
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,840
- You're scaring me.
 -  He's curious.

1385
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,000
All right.

1386
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,760
So these are on my team.

1387
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,490
- Next, Team Seok Jin.
 -  Well...

1388
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:22,090
Myung Ho told me about his life.

1389
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:23,290
It was so...

1390
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:24,300
(Would you like to know about him?)

1391
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,300
(In "Breaking Walls" earlier,)

1392
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,830
(the luckiest one was to be eliminated.)

1393
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:34,830
(When everyone else broke through the walls,)

1394
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:36,740
(Myung Ho was left alone.)

1395
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,900
(He's definitely the unluckiest one.)

1396
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:42,490
I told Gary before.

1397
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:44,990
When we were doing the 100 versus 100 Special,

1398
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:46,460
I told Gary to invite Myung Ho.

1399
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,090
- I tried to.
 -  Then why?

1400
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:51,360
Myung Ho, why didn't you come before?

1401
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,370
The thing is, I'm sick.

1402
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,590
(I was sick.)

1403
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:57,400
I'm really sick.

1404
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,590
Why is it so sad?

1405
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:00,990
- It's true.
 -  I shouldn't laugh.

1406
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:03,290
You look healthy.

1407
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:04,990
- I'm really sick.
 -  What's the problem?

1408
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:08,760
I've been too stressed out.

1409
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,490
I used to weigh 62kg, but now I weigh only 49kg.

1410
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:14,760
I used to see him a lot.

1411
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,990
Compared to the past,

1412
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,290
- Is he a lot thinner now?
 -  he has become very thin.

1413
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:23,070
I made a debut on September 23, 1995.

1414
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:24,690
- The band's name was "Honey".
 -  Right.

1415
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:26,090
The song was called "A Kid Called X".

1416
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:27,290
We made a debut at around the same time.

1417
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:29,070
Can you rap for us?

1418
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:32,490
You were born in a small town

1419
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,790
To a poor family

1420
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:36,100
You don't seem to be sick at all.

1421
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,370
(He doesn't seem sick at all.)

1422
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:40,100
- I'm not sick when I rap.
 -  He's not sick when he raps.

1423
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,890
You said you have heart problems.

1424
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:45,090
- How can he rap like that?
 -  I thought he was sick.

1425
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:47,390
- I'm really sick.
 -  He doesn't have panic disorder.

1426
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:49,050
- He seems fine.
 -  He doesn't have panic disorder.

1427
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,560
- You look very healthy.
 -  Are you really sick?

1428
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,390
He insists he has panic disorder, but he talked so much in the car.

1429
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:54,690
Actually...

1430
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:56,490
You can even do a freestyle rap right now, right?

1431
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:59,200
I can do a freestyle rap, but I don't think people will understand

1432
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,190
They think rap has to have rhymes

1433
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:04,390
This is rap to me, but people never understand

1434
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:05,740
Why is that?

1435
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,360
I don't know why

1436
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,820
(This is what freestyle rap is.)

1437
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:11,490
Why? Would Seok Jin know?

1438
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:12,830
Would Jae Seok know?

1439
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,730
I can't seem to understand

1440
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:15,740
Why is that?

1441
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,190
(His introduction is over.)

1442
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:21,000
All right. Now,

1443
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,690
we should decide who will represent each team.

1444
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:26,000
- Do we need representatives?
 -  Let's play a simple game.

1445
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,470
(The first round of The First Unluckiest Festival starts now.)

1446
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:30,930
(Unlucky)

1447
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:33,470
(Round 1: The Battle of Aces)

1448
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:37,000
- This is a flour game.
 -  What kind of game is it?

1449
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,190
Flour?

1450
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:40,560
You will say numbers from 1 to 31.

1451
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,890
Our staff...

1452
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:45,660
will pick a number.

1453
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,760
(The one who says the chosen number will win.)

1454
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,200
The one who says that number will win.

1455
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,960
- The one who says that number?
 -  Exactly.

1456
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,730
We'll go up to 31.

1457
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:55,490
The one who is penalised wins.

1458
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:58,100
The one who gets the flour wins.

1459
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,760
The unluckiest will win.

1460
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,830
- Really?
 -  Okay.

1461
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:03,290
Are we to continue until 31?

1462
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:05,360
- The unluckiest wins.
 -  We need one from each team.

1463
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,090
Please send out your aces.

1464
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:08,490
We'll choose Hyun Soo.

1465
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:10,100
(Team Jae Seok chose Hyun Soo.)

1466
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,960
- Don't worry about getting hit.
 -  Okay.

1467
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,790
- You can get hit with the flour.
 -  We choose Mikey.

1468
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:14,860
Here comes Mikey.

1469
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,090
(He hasn't succeeded in anything else than Turbo.)

1470
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:18,360
- Good luck!
 -  Good luck!

1471
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,590
Go, Mikey!

1472
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:20,840
(Team Seok Jin chose Gary.)

1473
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,830
Show us how unlucky you are!

1474
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:23,930
- Show us!
 -  Good luck!

1475
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:25,760
We have the representatives here.

1476
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,490
The unluckiest is the luckiest today.

1477
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:30,560
- That's right.
 -  I can't believe this.

1478
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,660
- The unluckiest wins.
 -  This is amazing!

1479
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:34,060
- I'll pick a number.
 -  You have to focus on...

1480
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,660
- Okay, go ahead.
 -  getting unlucky.

1481
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,390
- The one who gets the flour wins.
 -  If you believe...

1482
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:40,970
you will choose the right number, then you will win.

1483
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:43,360
- Ready.
 -  Please.

1484
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,700
- Please!
 -  Start!

1485
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:46,500
One, two.

1486
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:47,870
Three.

1487
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,170
- Four.
 -  Say as many numbers as you can.

1488
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:52,390
(Say as many numbers as you can.)

1489
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:54,070
Five, six, seven.

1490
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,890
- Good job.
 -  Then, 8, 9, 10.

1491
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:56,900
It must be near.

1492
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,050
They've come far.

1493
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:00,000
11, 12, 13.

1494
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,670
(It should burst about now.)

1495
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,670
14, 15, 16.

1496
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,470
17.

1497
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:09,900
- 18.
 -  It's until 31.

1498
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,740
19, 20.

1499
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,500
- Didn't he say 4 numbers?
 -  21, 22, 23.

1500
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,660
- It's almost over.
 -  Wait a minute!

1501
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:18,900
(Panicking)

1502
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:20,860
He said, 21, 22, 23.

1503
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,590
- Will Gary win?
 -  Not many numbers are left.

1504
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:24,460
- Wait!
 -  31 is the last one.

1505
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:27,090
- Say as many numbers as possible!
 -  You need to win!

1506
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:29,060
- Should I say many?
 -  Yes, you should.

1507
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,290
Mikey could get the flour!

1508
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:31,560
- You need to get it right!
 -  Say as many as possible.

1509
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,730
- Oh, I need to win, right?
 -  Yes, that's right.

1510
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:34,290
The one who gets the flour wins.

1511
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:37,100
24, 25, 26.

1512
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,990
(What will happen?)

1513
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:41,800
- Say as many as possible!
 -  It didn't burst!

1514
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,290
(Only five numbers are left.)

1515
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:46,740
- Say as many as you can.
 -  27, 28, 29.

1516
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,300
(It popped!)

1517
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,560
(The balloon burst!)

1518
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,690
28, 29.

1519
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:55,200
(We won!)

1520
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,090
- We did it.
 -  We won!

1521
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:58,190
We did it!

1522
00:54:58,190 --> 00:54:59,690
(Too bad)

1523
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:00,890
Our guest won.

1524
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:02,650
You're so unlucky!

1525
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:04,650
I've never won something like this.

1526
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:06,390
It's a good thing, right?

1527
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,590
- Of course, it's a good thing.
 -  You won.

1528
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:09,600
(The whole team is happy.)

1529
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,090
(Staff picked the number 28.)

1530
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:15,300
- Say as many as you can.
 -  27, 28, 29.

1531
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,670
(It popped!)

1532
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,990
(He's happy to be covered in flour.)

1533
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:26,100
(They're sad that they weren't covered in flour.)

1534
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:29,190
Too bad.

1535
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:30,290
It's all thanks to Gary.

1536
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:32,690
Hyun Soo, you're so unlucky.

1537
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:34,490
- What's this?
 -  I can't believe it.

1538
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:36,000
(Gary and Hyun Soo are out.)

1539
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,850
We're in trouble. What should we do?

1540
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,490
We have four left.

1541
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:41,100
Team Kwang Soo is amazing.

1542
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,390
- Of course!
 -  Yes!

1543
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:45,590
No one can be unluckier than Kwang Soo.

1544
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:47,690
The whole team is benefiting from his bad luck.

1545
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:49,790
I didn't know we would ever play this kind of game.

1546
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:52,490
His bad luck is beyond imagination.

1547
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:53,940
(Today, the unluckiest is the luckiest.)

1548
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,860
(Unlucky)

1549
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:59,070
(Round 2: Team Battle)

1550
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,890
Now, it's a team battle.

1551
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:05,220
The winning team doesn't have to eliminate anyone.

1552
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,030
- One person for second in place.
 -  One needs to be eliminated.

1553
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,690
For the third in place, three people need to be eliminated.

1554
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:12,230
If Team Seok Jin eliminates two people,

1555
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:14,130
- you'll be near to losing.
 -  We'll only have one person left.

1556
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:17,590
That's right. We will invite three people from each team.

1557
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:19,050
- Please come forward.
 -  Okay.

1558
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:20,510
Three people, please step forward.

1559
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,140
- Let's go.
 -  We can do it.

1560
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,130
- Okay, we can do it.
 -  Three people, please step forward.

1561
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,760
- We need to be in first place.
 -  I'll go first.

1562
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,140
- Let's go.
 -  Lizzie, you go.

1563
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,050
- We need to be in first place.
 -  We just need the first place.

1564
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:32,130
We used to do this often. There are nine wooden sticks.

1565
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:35,040
- I believe in you, Kwang Soo.
 -  You're out if it breaks.

1566
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,790
- You're out if it breaks.
 -  Yes.

1567
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:38,530
Ji Hyo, which one will you choose?

1568
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:40,710
- The one that doesn't break, right?
 -  Yes.

1569
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:41,860
This is very confusing.

1570
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,440
- I'll choose the last one.
 -  Okay.

1571
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:46,230
- Please hold onto it.
 -  The one that doesn't break?

1572
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:47,240
Next.

1573
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,130
The fourth one from the left.

1574
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:52,530
- I'm not sure about that.
 -  One that doesn't break.

1575
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:53,600
- It's this one, right?
 -  Yes.

1576
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,140
- The one that doesn't break.
 -  The stick that doesn't break.

1577
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,630
I'll choose the second one from the back.

1578
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:57,860
Okay.

1579
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:59,650
- The unluckiest person...
 -  All three of ours could break.

1580
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,230
- The unluckiest person...
 -  Yes, all could break.

1581
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:03,590
The unluckiest comedian.

1582
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:04,600
- The unluckiest.
 -  Yes.

1583
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,840
- The second one from the back.
 -  Okay.

1584
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,630
- Please don't touch.
 -  Lee Wan?

1585
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,030
(Even Lee Wan is serious.)

1586
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:12,940
- The one on the far left.
 -  This one?

1587
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,040
- It looks highly breakable.
 -  Here you go.

1588
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,860
The second one on the left.

1589
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,390
- Okay.
 -  Yes.

1590
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:20,940
I think all three won't break.

1591
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,230
- The white one.
 -  This looks breakable.

1592
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,010
- Will it?
 -  The white one?

1593
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:25,430
I'll go with the one on the right.

1594
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:26,860
- This one?
 -  No, the other one.

1595
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,290
- This one?
 -  Yes.

1596
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:30,030
- Here you go.
 -  I have no choice?

1597
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,580
No.

1598
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:32,790
We'll go at the same time.

1599
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:33,980
- Everyone.
 -  You can do it.

1600
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:35,240
- Kwang Soo, do you want to switch?
 -  I think this might break.

1601
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,690
- One.
 -  I'm scared.

1602
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:39,340
Let's stand wide apart.

1603
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:41,010
This is making me nervous.

1604
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:42,930
If it hurts you, you pass.

1605
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,490
I want to be hurt.

1606
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,230
- What's that?
 -  Please hurt me.

1607
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,690
- Please.
 -  I want to bleed from my head.

1608
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:50,390
- Hurt me.
 -  Let's go.

1609
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:52,140
Why is Lee Wan here?

1610
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,130
- Why is he here?
 -  Why?

1611
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:55,140
Why is Lee Wan here?

1612
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,540
- We'll go at the same time.
 -  It is worth enduring.

1613
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,540
- One.
 -  It'd hurt.

1614
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,030
(One)

1615
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:04,130
Two.

1616
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:05,630
(Two)

1617
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:06,640
Three.

1618
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:10,140
(The moment of fate)

1619
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:11,740
(Smashing)

1620
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:16,440
(The sound of wooden sticks breaking resonates.)

1621
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,890
(Ji Hyo, Seok Jin and Jung A chose the broken wooden sticks.)

1622
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:20,430
- What is this?
 -  I'm alive.

1623
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:22,230
(Team Kwang Soo all survived.)

1624
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:23,630
What is this?

1625
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:26,580
- All of our members made it.
 -  We all survived.

1626
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,890
- They chose the wrong ones.
 -  I was really scared.

1627
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:30,040
Look at them.

1628
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,230
That team is awesome.

1629
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:33,330
- How could they all live?
 -  That's awesome.

1630
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,490
- Did they all survive?
 -  They all survived.

1631
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:35,850
- Really?
 -  That's amazing.

1632
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:38,530
- I thought mine would break.
 -  Wax is our only hope.

1633
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:39,860
- Really.
 -  Oh, no.

1634
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:41,440
- She is very unlucky.
 -  She's unlucky.

1635
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:44,390
The remaining six will move on.

1636
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:45,760
(The 6 that survived will move on to the next game.)

1637
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,830
- They're amazing.
 -  Team Kwang Soo.

1638
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:49,940
- I didn't even have a choice.
 -  No one is out.

1639
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:51,940
- It's amazing.
 -  Oh, my goodness.

1640
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:53,340
(Unlucky)

1641
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,340
It's the second round.

1642
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:58,640
Lee Wan is the only survivor of our team.

1643
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,890
He's quite unlucky.

1644
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:02,230
- You never know.
 -  Yes, you never know.

1645
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:05,230
There is a sword in each sheathe. If you draw a sword,

1646
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:06,940
there will be something embarrassing inside.

1647
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:09,340
- So you win if it's embarrassing?
 -  Yes.

1648
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:10,540
(You need to pick 1 of the 3 swords which is embarrassing.)

1649
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:11,660
(The last survivor, Wax chooses one.)

1650
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:12,930
- Hold onto it.
 -  Okay.

1651
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:14,760
- Lee Wan?
 -  Be unlucky.

1652
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,830
(Be unlucky.)

1653
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:17,530
- I'm blessing him.
 -  That's right.

1654
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:18,940
- He needs to be unlucky.
 -  That's right.

1655
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:21,940
- He needs to be unlucky here.
 -  Yes, that's right.

1656
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:24,130
- You need to be unlucky.
 -  It's not a bad thing to say here.

1657
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:25,240
Lee Wan, you're unlucky.

1658
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,430
Chang Hie, you're lucky.

1659
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:29,070
- It's bad to say one's lucky.
 -  Chang Hie, you're lucky.

1660
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:30,940
And Lizzy?

1661
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,130
Lizzy will be lucky.

1662
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:35,640
- Now.
 -  I think this is a good one.

1663
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,420
- Wax, you'll be very unlucky.
 -  Now.

1664
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,330
Starting with Wax, say, "You, take my sword."

1665
00:59:40,330 --> 00:59:41,790
- "You, take my sword."
 -  She'll be unlucky.

1666
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:43,430
- We'll go in order.
 -  Okay.

1667
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:45,140
You, take my sword.

1668
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,140
(There's nothing inside.)

1669
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,490
Take my sword.

1670
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:52,540
(Flying)

1671
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,920
- Look on the floor.
 -  Oh, my.

1672
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,530
(A leek flew out.)

1673
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:00,230
- Wax.
 -  The unluckiest person.

1674
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,890
(She passed by drawing a leek.)

1675
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:05,930
(Slapping)

1676
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:08,900
(That was unexpected.)

1677
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,030
- You're number one.
 -  Aren't I unlucky?

1678
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:14,040
- I'm unlucky.
 -  You really are unlucky.

1679
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,700
(I was hit by a leek, shouldn't I win by default?)

1680
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,040
(Go, Wax.)

1681
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,500
She is truly unlucky.

1682
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:21,790
- She's truly unlucky.
 -  Really.

1683
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:23,290
You're a strong candidate to win.

1684
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:26,040
- How did that get him?
 -  You're right.

1685
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,330
Wan is very unlucky.

1686
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:30,600
He could have caught the leek with his mouth.

1687
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:35,910
Wan, this is a great fit for a historical drama.

1688
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:37,030
- Your hair, too.
 -  You're acting.

1689
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:38,840
- Right.
 -  He looks lucky.

1690
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:41,630
(You...)

1691
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:43,010
Take my sword.

1692
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,040
(You, take my sword.)

1693
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,330
(It's a sword.)

1694
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:48,490
- Oh, no.
 -  He picked a sword.

1695
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:49,750
Oh, no.

1696
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:52,330
(It looked like a scene from a historical drama.)

1697
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:55,310
(A perfect sword came out like a scene from a historical drama.)

1698
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:56,660
It would have been great if a leek came out.

1699
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,620
Really.

1700
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,390
A stem of a garlic should have come out.

1701
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:03,330
- He is really unlucky.
 -  It's a pity.

1702
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:04,660
You look like you're really disappointed.

1703
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:06,840
I got hit with a leek.

1704
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,920
Wan looks disappointed.

1705
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,530
He drew a sword, and he's disappointed.

1706
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:12,330
This makes you competitive.

1707
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:14,230
- He wanted to go to the next round.
 -  Yes.

1708
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:15,590
Our team can't all lose.

1709
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:17,230
In Donnie Yen style.

1710
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:18,240
Donnie Yen style.

1711
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:21,340
- Donnie Yen style.
 -  He looks exactly like him.

1712
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:23,240
He looks exactly like him.

1713
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,140
You, take my sword.

1714
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:28,390
(It's a normal sword.)

1715
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:29,890
Oh, no.

1716
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:31,730
- Then two of us will pass.
 -  Oh, my.

1717
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:33,030
What is that?

1718
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:34,430
(Then 2 of Team Kwang Soo will automatically pass.)

1719
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:35,660
- Two of us will live.
 -  Two of us.

1720
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:37,870
- They are very unlucky.
 -  This scares me.

1721
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:40,040
There are three unlucky ones?

1722
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,140
- You, take my sword.
 -  You, take my sword.

1723
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,670
(Screaming)

1724
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:46,610
- Take my sword.
 -  Take my sword.

1725
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:48,540
(Lizzie drew a snake.)

1726
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:53,130
(Kwang Soo drew an octopus arm.)

1727
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:55,390
I'm getting goosebumps.

1728
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:56,430
What is that?

1729
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:57,830
You're really amazing.

1730
01:01:57,830 --> 01:01:59,590
- Really.
 -  You're really amazing.

1731
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:00,930
You...

1732
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:02,870
- You're really unlucky.
 -  He's really unlucky.

1733
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:04,930
- Really.
 -  He's amazing.

1734
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:08,030
- He's amazing.
 -  I was going to pick that.

1735
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:09,800
But I switched at the last minute.

1736
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:11,690
This is scary.

1737
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:14,140
- He really unlucky.
 -  He's amazing.

1738
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,240
Our team has lost.

1739
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,290
(Wax versus Kwang Soo and Lizzy)

1740
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:22,900
How could this happen?

1741
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:24,940
You can do it.

1742
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:27,230
- Let's win this round.
 -  Okay.

1743
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:28,330
- Next.
 -  You're unlucky.

1744
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:30,490
- Now.
 -  Let's win this.

1745
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:33,500
Up against Kwang Soo is the rising star,

1746
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,860
- Wax.
 -  She is very unlucky.

1747
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:38,620
- I didn't even imagine.
 -  She is truly unlucky.

1748
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:41,530
There are 2 raw eggs among the 3 eggs.

1749
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:44,430
Okay. Kwang Soo is known to pick raw eggs.

1750
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:47,290
Kwang Soo, Lizzy and Wax please come forward.

1751
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:48,940
Go, Wax.

1752
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,770
- Will it be one of them?
 -  I'm here thanks to you.

1753
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:54,340
(There is only 1 raw egg among 20 eggs.)

1754
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:57,230
- It always goes to Kwang Soo.
 -  Kwang Soo picks the one.

1755
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:58,740
(The first one picked was the raw egg.)

1756
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:01,030
(Oh, my goodness.)

1757
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:02,130
What's that?

1758
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:04,020
He can't pick it again.

1759
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:06,230
- It'll be amazing.
 -  Then he is definitely unlucky.

1760
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:07,540
(The second one he picks again is raw.)

1761
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:10,140
- It'll be amazing.
 -  Then he is definitely unlucky.

1762
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:12,640
(Smashing)

1763
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:14,140
Oh, my.

1764
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:17,130
How could you be so unlucky?

1765
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:18,630
No, that means he's lucky.

1766
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:19,890
(Raw eggs were the beginning of Kwang Soo's unlucky path.)

1767
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:22,430
There are two raw eggs.

1768
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:24,030
Lizzy, please pick first.

1769
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:25,740
- I'll...
 -  Wait.

1770
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,930
Okay, it's better that you go first.

1771
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:29,430
- She isn't unlucky.
 -  Next.

1772
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:30,530
- Kwang Soo.
 -  Please go first.

1773
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:32,600
Don't pick, Wax. Kwang Soo is unlucky.

1774
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,110
- You shouldn't pick that.
 -  He's right.

1775
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:37,510
- Why are you trembling?
 -  I'm nervous.

1776
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:39,860
- You can do it.
 -  Kwang Soo has no choice.

1777
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:41,330
- He's afraid.
 -  Yes.

1778
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:43,130
- Why are you trembling?
 -  Wax.

1779
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:45,140
- Don't pressure yourself.
 -  I feel burdened to win.

1780
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:46,490
- You shouldn't.
 -  Okay.

1781
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:47,530
Just be yourself.

1782
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:51,600
- Okay.
 -  Kwang Soo, you look very calm.

1783
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,040
Eggs are my friend.

1784
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,130
Raw eggs.

1785
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:58,430
We say that even the boiled eggs become raw eggs...

1786
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:00,610
- when Kwang Soo picks them.
 -  They turn into raw eggs.

1787
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:01,730
It's a miracle.

1788
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:03,740
Crack it hard on your head.

1789
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,130
Okay, 1, 2...

1790
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:07,660
(Two)

1791
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:09,140
Three.

1792
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,300
(Smashing)

1793
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:15,120
(Wax picked a raw egg.)

1794
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,140
Wax.

1795
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,330
(Lizzy picked a boiled egg.)

1796
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:19,880
Wax.

1797
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,890
(Kwang Soo obviously picked the raw egg.)

1798
01:04:21,890 --> 01:04:24,530
- It's Kwang Soo.
 -  He's amazing.

1799
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:25,590
(He's amazing.)

1800
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:26,940
It didn't break.

1801
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:30,540
(He is always the unluckiest.)

1802
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,310
(Goosebumps)

1803
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:35,140
Wax is amazing.

1804
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:37,760
Wax and Kwang Soo are both amazing.

1805
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,890
(Wax and Kwang Soo are the top two unluckiest.)

1806
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:41,030
- Oh, my.
 -  Really.

1807
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:42,930
- Let's win.
 -  It's getting heated.

1808
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:44,230
- He doesn't look happy.
 -  This is so funny.

1809
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:46,040
The atmosphere is heating up.

1810
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,490
- How could this happen?
 -  Really...

1811
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:48,830
The unluckiest...

1812
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:50,860
Myung Ho is very happy.

1813
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:51,930
Why?

1814
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,540
He has recovered from his illness.

1815
01:04:54,670 --> 01:04:55,890
He has fully recovered.

1816
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:57,780
You are witnessing the miracle of a full recovery.

1817
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:00,380
Let's give a round of applause for the two that made...

1818
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:02,040
Myung Ho leap up from his chair.

1819
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,660
(This is the spirit of The Unluckiest Festival.)

1820
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:05,030
You are amazing.

1821
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:06,130
This is fun.

1822
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:07,740
- I respect you, Wax.
 -  Wax, you are amazing.

1823
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:09,940
- This is...
 -  Kwang Soo is amazing, too.

1824
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:13,320
- Kwang Soo is amazing.
 -  They even live in the same flat.

1825
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:15,130
- They're neighbours?
 -  We're neighbours.

1826
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:17,390
- They're amazing.
 -  Don't touch, you'll get unlucky.

1827
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:19,390
(This is the last match between the two.)

1828
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:21,900
- Now, you two are left.
 -  They'll shoot against each other.

1829
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:26,130
Kwang Soo is known to be a champion in this area.

1830
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:28,390
- Of course.
 -  He is truly one of the unluckiest.

1831
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:30,220
Even his name sounds like the word "unlucky".

1832
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:32,130
- He is truly...
 -  My name, too?

1833
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:34,830
He already has a reputation for being unlucky.

1834
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:37,660
- Right.
 -  But a new, strong candidate,

1835
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:39,390
Wax, has appeared.

1836
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:41,240
- I never expected that.
 -  Me neither.

1837
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,030
This is the first time I'm this happy for being unlucky.

1838
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:45,130
I know.

1839
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:47,130
This is the exact intention of this special.

1840
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:49,140
Being unlucky could make you happy.

1841
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:50,430
- That's right.
 -  Yes.

1842
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:53,530
Kwang Soo, many people are envious of you.

1843
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:55,930
I feel that you are afraid of yourself.

1844
01:05:55,930 --> 01:05:57,700
I never thought I was this unlucky.

1845
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,840
I really didn't.

1846
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,790
- I didn't know.
 -  Really.

1847
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:03,130
- He is very unlucky.
 -  Yes.

1848
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:05,060
Really. Please choose one.

1849
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:06,330
(Final Team Round: Unlucky Inkgun)

1850
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:07,630
- The second one.
 -  You chose the second one.

1851
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:08,870
- Good.
 -  He chose the second one?

1852
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:10,860
(One of them has ink inside.)

1853
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:12,440
One has ink inside, while the other has water in it.

1854
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,590
I see.

1855
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:15,940
- If you get ink on your face...
 -  Good.

1856
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:17,870
The one who gets ink on his or her face will win.

1857
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:19,430
- Go!
 -  Gosh.

1858
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:21,260
- It makes me nervous.
 -  You win if you're shot with ink.

1859
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:22,440
- One!
 -  Wax, way to go!

1860
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,430
Two!

1861
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:27,640
(Two)

1862
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:28,790
Three!

1863
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:30,370
(Three)

1864
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:36,170
(My goodness.)

1865
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:40,860
(Kwang Soo's face is covered with ink.)

1866
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:44,040
(Kwang Soo's team wins in this round.)

1867
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,270
What is this?

1868
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,870
- Gosh.
 -  So he chose the right one.

1869
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:51,270
Kwang Soo doesn't look happy.

1870
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:52,770
- This is scary.
 -  I thought his gun was empty.

1871
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:54,630
- It is scary.
 -  This is scary.

1872
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:56,160
- I even got goosebumps.
 -  Gosh.

1873
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,260
- It is so scary.
 -  Right.

1874
01:06:57,260 --> 01:06:58,860
So Kwang Soo's team won!

1875
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:00,870
(Kwang Soo did a great job, and his team won in this round!)

1876
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:03,930
- You have to be on the right team.
 -  Right.

1877
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:05,970
- Gosh.
 -  I couldn't believe it.

1878
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,700
(Poor me)

1879
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:14,070
(Ji Hyo, Lee Wan and Chang Hie are out.)

1880
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:15,960
I think Kwang Soo is amazing.

1881
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,160
- He is.
 -  Right.

1882
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,640
We've known that he is amazing for a long time.

1883
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:21,430
It's time for Jin Ho to play his role.

1884
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:22,640
- Yes!
 -  What can I do for you?

1885
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:25,060
"What can I do for you?"

1886
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:26,270
(Is it my turn now?)

1887
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:29,060
(During break time a while ago)

1888
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:31,570
This is a banana-flavoured chocolate pie.

1889
01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:33,060
(Members are taking a short break while eating snacks.)

1890
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:34,460
We should eat now.

1891
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:35,770
Is this a new product?

1892
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:40,160
(One guy seems to be obsessed with snacks.)

1893
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,040
I've never tried this banana-flavoured one.

1894
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,740
He is serious.

1895
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:47,600
(He is getting energy from sweet snacks.)

1896
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:49,560
- "What can I do for you?"
 -  I was about to go home.

1897
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:51,160
- No, just sit there.
 -  Really?

1898
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,440
(Just sit there.)

1899
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:55,810
Is that what he has to do?

1900
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:56,960
Just sit there.

1901
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,160
We will play games.

1902
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,340
- Leaders, please come out.
 -  Okay.

1903
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:02,470
- The leaders.
 -  I'm nervous.

1904
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:05,260
- Kwang Soo is so cool.
 -  He is too strong.

1905
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,560
- I trust you.
 -  He is strong.

1906
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,170
I can never beat Kwang Soo.

1907
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:10,860
We three will drink beverages.

1908
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:13,550
- The one who drinks bitter one...
 -  Really?

1909
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:15,260
can recruit Jin Ho as your member.

1910
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,270
- Wow, really?
 -  That's nice.

1911
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:18,600
- Kwang Soo, you can do it!
 -  He'll win.

1912
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,730
Let's go.

1913
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:20,870
This looks tasty.

1914
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:22,830
- Good.
 -  I'll drink this one.

1915
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:24,560
- Right.
 -  You chose what looks tasty.

1916
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,070
- Okay.
 -  Good.

1917
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:27,870
- I chose this one.
 -  This looks...

1918
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:29,970
- This looks...
 -  Let's drink.

1919
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:31,060
This looks tasty.

1920
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:32,690
One, two...

1921
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:35,660
(One of them is herbal medicine.)

1922
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:37,690
(Which unlucky guy will be able to recruit Jin Ho?)

1923
01:08:37,690 --> 01:08:39,170
Two, three.

1924
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:40,690
You can do it, Jae Seok.

1925
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:41,970
(Gulping)

1926
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:46,630
- Gosh, is this true?
 -  No way.

1927
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:48,270
- Please, stop.
 -  Really?

1928
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:51,700
(No way. Stop fooling us.)

1929
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:53,960
(He is not lying.)

1930
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,460
- Gosh.
 -  Really?

1931
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:56,960
- No way.
 -  Is this really happening?

1932
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,870
(He can't pretend because the herbal medicine is too bitter.)

1933
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:01,630
- My goodness.
 -  Is yours herbal medicine?

1934
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:03,260
- Oh, my.
 -  Really?

1935
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:04,360
- Spit it out.
 -  He drank coffee...

1936
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:05,630
- and mine is grape juice.
 -  Spit it out!

1937
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:07,160
Amazing! Lee Kwang Soo!

1938
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,580
(Amazing Kwang Soo chose the herbal medicine.)

1939
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,600
- What is this?
 -  It's unbelievable.

1940
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,860
- Wow.
 -  How can this happen?

1941
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:14,660
- My goodness.
 -  You're scary now.

1942
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,970
- You're so scary now.
 -  This is so bitter.

1943
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:20,160
- It is really bitter.
 -  We chose...

1944
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,560
the beverages with different colours intentionally.

1945
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,790
You did intentionally?

1946
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:24,140
(Scary)

1947
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:28,830
- Kwang Soo, you're amazing.
 -  No one can beat him ever.

1948
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:30,640
- No one can defeat him.
 -  Right.

1949
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:33,270
Jin Ho, good for you.

1950
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:35,960
- Great.
 -  Finally.

1951
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,160
- Kwang Soo.
 -  You're in our team now.

1952
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,530
- Good.
 -  You're in our team.

1953
01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:40,260
There are six members in his team.

1954
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:41,860
- Unbelievable.
 -  Gosh.

1955
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:43,160
- I don't think we can win.
 -  How can this be possible?

1956
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,580
- He must be very unlucky.
 -  Right.

1957
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:47,590
- If you lose at last...
 -  Yes.

1958
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:50,060
after winning in a row like this, it means you're super unlucky.

1959
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,540
- Right.
 -  That is the worst.

1960
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:54,060
- Gosh.
 -  If you lose at last...

1961
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:55,770
(Will Kwang Soo be able to become the super unlucky guy?)

1962
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:57,540
It was close.

1963
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:59,560
It was close, right?

1964
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,840
(Seok Jin won against Jae Seok.)

1965
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:04,940
- I did good.
 -  I am sure he can't win this time.

1966
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:05,970
All right.

1967
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:07,540
- Let's do rock-paper-scissors.
 -  Okay.

1968
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:08,970
- Rock, paper, scissors.
 -  Rock, paper, scissors.

1969
01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:11,440
(The one who chooses wasabi pie wins.)

1970
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,470
His bad luck has come.

1971
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,270
Now I feel his bad luck.

1972
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:17,420
- Jae Seok lost...
 -  I know how unlucky you can be...

1973
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:20,530
- You know...
 -  He started losing.

1974
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:21,970
once I start losing, I can be unlucky the whole day.

1975
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:23,070
- Right.
 -  Yes.

1976
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:24,360
- Don't let your guard down.
 -  I am very unlucky, too.

1977
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,260
- You should try your best.
 -  You know how unlucky I can be.

1978
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:29,340
- Jae Seok.
 -  Jae Seok can be very unlucky.

1979
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:30,470
Good luck.

1980
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:33,570
- Jae Seok.
 -  Gosh.

1981
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:35,340
That's like a curse to say now.

1982
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:37,070
Go for it, Jae Seok!

1983
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:42,060
- Yu Jae Seok!
 -  Yu Jae Seok!

1984
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:44,780
- Yu Jae Seok!
 -  You can do it!

1985
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:46,830
- Good luck!
 -  Go for it, Jae Seok.

1986
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:49,840
Kwang Soo is very good at this.

1987
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,160
(Kwang Soo is setting another record of how unlucky he can get.)

1988
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,360
(Jae Seok is another who has experienced much bad luck.)

1989
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,660
That would really mean unlucky.

1990
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:56,770
- It's fun.
 -  Please.

1991
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:59,470
One has banana cream inside and the other one...

1992
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:02,760
Gosh.

1993
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,780
(What is this?)

1994
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:07,240
Kwang Soo got it!

1995
01:11:07,770 --> 01:11:09,700
- It's incredible.
 -  Kwang Soo!

1996
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:11,530
- Gosh.
 -  It's unbelievable.

1997
01:11:11,530 --> 01:11:12,660
- Oh, my.
 -  Spit it out.

1998
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:15,050
Kwang Soo, don't swallow that. Spit that out.

1999
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:16,260
My goodness.

2000
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:17,370
(He can't swallow the wasabi pie.)

2001
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,970
(Even the staff who prepared the pie are amazed.)

2002
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:28,690
(This probability is 0.15 percent.)

2003
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:30,560
- My goodness.
 -  Gosh.

2004
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,060
You don't have to eat it.

2005
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,260
- Okay?
 -  Spit it out.

2006
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:34,660
How can you never lose?

2007
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:36,530
- Is this really possible?
 -  Spit it out.

2008
01:11:36,530 --> 01:11:38,730
- How can this happen?
 -  It looks tasty.

2009
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:40,970
- Things aren't going right today.
 -  He's too strong.

2010
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:43,360
Kwang Soo wins every game.

2011
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,570
Kwang Soo won!

2012
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:48,340
- Yes!
 -  There are six including Kwang Soo.

2013
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,340
- Now...
 -  Gosh.

2014
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:53,460
My team is out!

2015
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:56,740
- Are you okay?
 -  We did nothing today.

2016
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:59,870
- We were too lucky today.
 -  Right.

2017
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:03,460
- This is really frustrating.
 -  Are you all out?

2018
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:05,070
I am sorry. I am lucky today.

2019
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:07,530
- Please give him water.
 -  You're so unlucky.

2020
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:09,660
I should've let handsome Lee Wan sit in front of me.

2021
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:10,860
My goodness.

2022
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:13,340
- Wow.
 -  Can this really happen?

2023
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:15,940
- He is the unluckiest guy.
 -  There must be something to him.

2024
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:18,050
I and Kwang Soo have become a little close.

2025
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:19,070
I think I should keep a distance from him.

2026
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:22,610
(Why am I so unlucky?)

2027
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:27,070
(Jong Kook, Jae Seok and Jung A are out.)

2028
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,970
- Now it's time for the final round.
 -  Okay.

2029
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:32,790
Team Seok Jin has two surviving members.

2030
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:36,940
To win, you should beat all five in Team Kwang Soo.

2031
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:38,230
We can do it!

2032
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:39,970
We have numbers from 1 to 9.

2033
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:42,270
Wax, please choose one.

2034
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:43,860
- I am nervous.
 -  Five.

2035
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,640
- She chose 5.
 -  Number 5.

2036
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:47,690
It's ink cushion.

2037
01:12:47,690 --> 01:12:50,870
Please choose the opponent player, Wax.

2038
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,700
What about Jin Ho? He is not that unlucky.

2039
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:55,970
Jin Ho hasn't done anything so far.

2040
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,960
- What if he loses right away?
 -  I want to play, too.

2041
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,600
- Jin Ho.
 -  I'll choose Jin Ho.

2042
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,860
Good. Go, Jin Ho!

2043
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:02,440
Jin Ho now plays his first game.

2044
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:05,070
(Here comes Jin Ho, who has always been in the second place.)

2045
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:06,230
- You can do it!
 -  Good.

2046
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:09,060
Jin Ho isn't exactly a lucky person.

2047
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:11,960
- Actually, it depends.
 -  All right.

2048
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:14,970
Jin Ho somehow survived.

2049
01:13:15,370 --> 01:13:17,230
He could've just gone home.

2050
01:13:17,230 --> 01:13:19,990
- They even gave him taxi fare.
 -  Bad luck is good luck here.

2051
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:23,360
- Do they put it on their faces?
 -  One of them is ink cushion.

2052
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,760
Please bury your faces in them.

2053
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,160
She has to choose the ink cushion in order to win.

2054
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:29,360
- If I have a choice,
 -  Yes.

2055
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,530
- I want this one in front of me.
 -  This one? Okay.

2056
01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:32,650
- I want the same one.
 -  Decide by rock-paper-scissors.

2057
01:13:32,650 --> 01:13:33,740
- Rock-paper-scissors.
 -  Rock-paper-scissors.

2058
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:35,260
Rock-paper-scissors!

2059
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:36,560
(Increased tension)

2060
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,060
- Wax chose the first one.
 -  Oh, please.

2061
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:41,460
(Wax chose the first one.)

2062
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:42,960
(Careful)

2063
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,260
- Hold it still.
 -  Hold it with your hands.

2064
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:46,470
Right. And...

2065
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:49,850
Be brave and bury your face in it.

2066
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:51,960
- Bury your faces at once.
 -  I'm scared.

2067
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,530
- You can do it!
 -  Go for it!

2068
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:55,460
- One, two...
 -  It's your first try.

2069
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:57,060
You can't lose here.

2070
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:58,470
- One, two, three!
 -  Go!

2071
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:02,510
Rub them on your face.

2072
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:03,570
- Wax.
 -  No!

2073
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:06,870
(Look at Wax's face)

2074
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:09,370
- Wax won.
 -  Praise her.

2075
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:12,790
(Praise this unlucky lady!)

2076
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:15,460
- Jin Ho lost.
 -  Is it on my face?

2077
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,360
Is the ink on my face?

2078
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,060
- Gosh.
 -  No way!

2079
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:21,470
I only just joined the game.

2080
01:14:23,370 --> 01:14:24,760
Jin Ho is out.

2081
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,060
- Go and sit there.
 -  Gosh.

2082
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:28,790
- Could she recognise it?
 -  You're incredible.

2083
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:30,660
I should have gone home earlier.

2084
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:31,970
(Jin Ho is very unlucky in another way, too.)

2085
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:33,930
- Wax is strong, too.
 -  Who is next?

2086
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:35,060
Which number will you pick?

2087
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:36,560
- I think she will beat them all.
 -  Three.

2088
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:37,970
- Three? Good.
 -  You can do it!

2089
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:39,770
Lighting up the lighter.

2090
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:41,870
- Who...
 -  Who do you want to play with?

2091
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:42,960
- I want Mikey.
 -  Mikey!

2092
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,870
- Good.
 -  Beat one by one.

2093
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:46,160
I win if mine doesn't work, right?

2094
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:47,540
- Right.
 -  All right.

2095
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:48,670
You will win if your lighter doesn't work.

2096
01:14:49,870 --> 01:14:51,740
- I want the second one.
 -  The second one. Wait.

2097
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:53,970
- Then, I'll choose the first one.
 -  Okay.

2098
01:14:55,470 --> 01:14:57,160
- Does it have to work to win?
 -  No, it shouldn't work.

2099
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,670
Why don't you understand the rule?

2100
01:14:59,610 --> 01:15:01,230
You win when things go wrong.

2101
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:02,660
- Now I got it.
 -  I won't look at my lighter.

2102
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:05,060
Will Wax be able to win again?

2103
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:06,360
One, two, three!

2104
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:10,160
(Will Wax win again? Or will Mikey become a new hero?)

2105
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:12,570
(Everyone is nervous.)

2106
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:15,060
Three!

2107
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:16,970
(Wax lost and Mikey won.)

2108
01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:22,240
(Mikey from Kwang Soo's team won!)

2109
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,260
- You did great!
 -  We made it!

2110
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:26,230
(It's hard to defeat Kwang Soo's team.)

2111
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,570
(It's good to be here!)

2112
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:31,230
- Good.
 -  Great job.

2113
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:32,670
I must be very unlucky.

2114
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:35,240
- Mikey is so unlucky.
 -  Right, he is.

2115
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,160
- Mikey, choose one number.
 -  My goodness.

2116
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,600
- Number 6.
 -  Yes, number 6!

2117
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,460
- Six!
 -  Whipped cream.

2118
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:43,150
- It's whipped cream.
 -  Seok Jin.

2119
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:44,790
- If Seok Jin loses here...
 -  If I lose,

2120
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:47,430
- I will admit my defeat.
 -  You know we have many players.

2121
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:50,850
If Seok Jin loses here, Kwang Soo's team will win.

2122
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:52,260
- Right.
 -  Then...

2123
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:55,260
we will find the first unluckiest person from Kwang Soo's team.

2124
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,630
You will draw a number now.

2125
01:15:57,630 --> 01:16:01,830
Then you should spin the roulette as many times as the number you get.

2126
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:03,070
- Okay.
 -  Good?

2127
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:04,560
Okay. The same number.

2128
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,730
If you pick the same number, the cream will fly to your face.

2129
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:08,840
Yes. And you pass.

2130
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,390
- You pass when you get the cream.
 -  Please pick a card.

2131
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:11,930
So it's good to get hit by the cream.

2132
01:16:11,930 --> 01:16:13,030
- That's right.
 -  Right.

2133
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:14,930
- Please reveal your number.
 -  It's one.

2134
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:16,990
- You get to turn it just once.
 -  Oh, no!

2135
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:18,130
- What?
 -  Is that good?

2136
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:19,810
- It's okay.
 -  Who?

2137
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:21,210
- Just once.
 -  Five.

2138
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:22,730
- You can turn it five times.
 -  He did it.

2139
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:25,830
- He did it.
 -  If I get it, it will prove that...

2140
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:27,350
Prove that you are really unlucky.

2141
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:30,570
All right. Please stick your face out a little more.

2142
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,740
- Great.
 -  I have to turn it five times.

2143
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:34,100
Five times.

2144
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:35,730
The chances are too low.

2145
01:16:35,730 --> 01:16:37,390
There you go.

2146
01:16:37,390 --> 01:16:39,390
- One, two...
 -  One, two...

2147
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:40,740
Three.

2148
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:42,430
(Flinching)

2149
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:43,930
Three.

2150
01:16:43,930 --> 01:16:45,120
Four.

2151
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,600
(He could get it once.)

2152
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,640
(Will he get it?)

2153
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:50,840
- Oh no.
 -  Gosh...

2154
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,100
(Both teams are safe until 6 turns.)

2155
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,730
- Oh dear.
 -  Just turn it once.

2156
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:56,470
- This is crazy.
 -  Stick out your face.

2157
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:58,560
- One.
 -  If I lose...

2158
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,530
- That's it.
 -  If I lose, it means I'm unlucky.

2159
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:02,540
Seok Jin is next.

2160
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,610
- You are innocent.
 -  You are counting, right?

2161
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:07,740
(It's a good thing to get cream on his face.)

2162
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:10,600
- Two.
 -  It's coming.

2163
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:11,630
(They can't help frowning their faces.)

2164
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:13,390
- Three.
 -  It's coming.

2165
01:17:13,390 --> 01:17:14,840
- Four.
 -  It's here.

2166
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,540
(The misfortune always comes unannounced.)

2167
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,230
(The crew chose the number 27.)

2168
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:21,630
(He gets slapped with cream.)

2169
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:24,240
(Slapping)

2170
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:27,040
(He's happy.)

2171
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:31,840
(Our leader is so unlucky!)

2172
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,360
- Bravo!
 -  Seok Jin passes!

2173
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,400
(They are sad.)

2174
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:38,130
We are going up.

2175
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:39,640
- Bravo.
 -  Good job.

2176
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,530
- I'll go with number 4.
 -  Number 4!

2177
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:42,830
- It's ripping plastic wrap.
 -  It's ripping plastic wrap.

2178
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:43,840
Get set. Go!

2179
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,940
(Seok Jin chooses a strong one and fails.)

2180
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:51,400
(Their jaws drop.)

2181
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,040
The winner is Seok Jin!

2182
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:55,600
- The winner is Seok Jin!
 -  Yes!

2183
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:56,920
Seok Jin succeeded.

2184
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,030
I choose number two.

2185
01:17:58,030 --> 01:17:59,130
It's picking farting cushion.

2186
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:00,940
Can't they just fart if they think they will lose?

2187
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:02,840
- You can do that.
 -  Right?

2188
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:04,630
- You will win then.
 -  Then it will sound the same.

2189
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:05,910
Three.

2190
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:07,830
(Seok Jin's cushion farts.)

2191
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:11,030
(Farting is Seok Jin's specialty. Seok Jin wins!)

2192
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:12,830
- Yes!
 -  Nice!

2193
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:14,190
Is he winning?

2194
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:16,430
Seok Jin goes to the finals!

2195
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:17,600
(Seok Jin wins three rounds and goes to the finals.)

2196
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,230
- Yes!
 -  Yes!

2197
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:21,190
You are the best!

2198
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:22,230
(He proves to everyone how unlucky he is.)

2199
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:24,490
Seok Jin is not an easy opponent.

2200
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:25,740
He's unbelievable.

2201
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:28,330
- He's no easy opponent.
 -  All right.

2202
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:30,120
- He's really unlucky.
 -  He is.

2203
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:34,460
(Now only Kwang Soo and Seok Jin are surviving.)

2204
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,460
Now, it's the competition of the kings.

2205
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:37,840
It's the competition of the century.

2206
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:40,130
I think we've been wasting time.

2207
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:42,930
After all, these two are going to compete.

2208
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:44,740
They could've competed from the start.

2209
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:46,000
(They should've competed from the start.)

2210
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:48,490
You've confirmed it.

2211
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:50,730
Many people came out here in the early morning...

2212
01:18:50,730 --> 01:18:52,360
and worked hard. But it was all for nothing.

2213
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,530
But at least now we know that we are not so unlucky.

2214
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:55,930
- Yes.
 -  We are happy.

2215
01:18:55,930 --> 01:18:57,290
- We are happy.
 -  Really.

2216
01:18:57,290 --> 01:18:58,600
- Everybody,
 -  Yes.

2217
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,730
we invited you here because you seemed to be unlucky.

2218
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:03,500
- But you are lucky after all.
 -  Yes.

2219
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:07,100
After playing those games,

2220
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:09,600
we must realise how lucky we are.

2221
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:10,730
- Yes.
 -  We are happy.

2222
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:11,930
- Of course.
 -  Realising that is the purpose.

2223
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:13,190
- You just need to realise that.
 -  Yes.

2224
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:15,830
The unluckiest person would be the one who doesn't fall into the mud.

2225
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:19,050
If one of these two...

2226
01:19:19,050 --> 01:19:21,230
doesn't fall into the mud,

2227
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:23,190
then that person...

2228
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:24,510
is really unlucky.

2229
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:26,930
- That would be tragic.
 -  We have to win.

2230
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:28,830
Since you came this far, you have to win.

2231
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:30,930
The person who doesn't win is the unluckiest person.

2232
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:32,130
You are right.

2233
01:19:32,130 --> 01:19:36,630
- Finally, it's the final game.
 -  Oh dear.

2234
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:39,930
They will play rock-paper-scissors and choose the chair to sit in.

2235
01:19:39,930 --> 01:19:41,360
- Rock-paper-scissors.
 -  Scissors.

2236
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,700
(Seok Jin wins.)

2237
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:44,740
That's luck, too.

2238
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:46,340
- Seok Jin.
 -  Did he win?

2239
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:49,070
- I will follow my gut feeling.
 -  Okay.

2240
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,100
- Winning is being unlucky.
 -  Yes.

2241
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:54,990
- Please go to your position.
 -  I chose this.

2242
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:56,290
- Me, too.
 -  Me, too.

2243
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:57,930
- I chose this.
 -  I chose this, too.

2244
01:19:57,930 --> 01:19:59,840
- I chose that.
 -  We chose this, too.

2245
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:03,840
- Is it muddy water?
 -  Is it cold?

2246
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:06,170
- Kwang Soo is ready to dive.
 -  It's Kwang Soo.

2247
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:07,510
I trust Kwang Soo.

2248
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:08,940
I want to win now!

2249
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,430
- Okay!
 -  Let's go!

2250
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:12,820
Who will be the first unluckiest man?

2251
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:14,620
(It's the match of the century.)

2252
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:17,330
We will soon know who he is.

2253
01:20:17,330 --> 01:20:18,560
I am scared.

2254
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,530
Why is this making us nervous? This is crazy.

2255
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:23,080
It's really nerve-racking.

2256
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,610
Please give it up for the two contenders!

2257
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:27,100
(The unlucky guests passionately root for them.)

2258
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:28,630
Come on!

2259
01:20:28,630 --> 01:20:29,640
Let's go!

2260
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:31,620
(The countdown starts.)

2261
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:32,730
One!

2262
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:33,740
(The countdown starts.)

2263
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:36,360
One!

2264
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:42,460
(Is it going to be Seok Jin who's writing a new legend?)

2265
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:43,600
Two!

2266
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:49,290
(Or is it going to be Kwang Soo who reached the spiritual realm?)

2267
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:52,130
(It was the viewers' most frequently asked question.)

2268
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:53,190
Three!

2269
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:59,490
(Who is the unluckiest member?)

2270
01:20:59,490 --> 01:21:00,560
Three!

2271
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,640
(Who will be the unluckiest man?)

2272
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:06,340
Three!

2273
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:09,410
(Seok Jin's chair breaks.)

2274
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:10,490
Three!

2275
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:11,640
(Seok Jin falls to the muddy water.)

2276
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:15,240
(It's Seok Jin.)

2277
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:18,240
I love you!

2278
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:24,990
(Oh my gosh.)

2279
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:27,740
- Yes!
 -  I love you!

2280
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:32,630
(The first Unluckiest Man is Jee Seok Jin.)

2281
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:33,830
All right!

2282
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:35,840
Seok Jin is the first Unluckiest Man!

2283
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:38,740
- This is crazy.
 -  He's soaked.

2284
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:41,930
- Kwang Soo, you're unluckier.
 -  This is crazy.

2285
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,430
- He's really unlucky.
 -  Yes.

2286
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:46,100
- He's really unlucky.
 -  It's Kwang Soo who's unlucky.

2287
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:48,840
- He was so close.
 -  He was almost there.

2288
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:53,930
(Do you think you are unlucky?)

2289
01:21:53,930 --> 01:21:58,940
(Don't worry. Kwang Soo is there for you.)

2290
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:00,990
(He smiles.)

2291
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:03,930
Many people agreed to come out...

2292
01:22:03,930 --> 01:22:05,600
even though we called them announced.

2293
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,130
We prepared them some gifts.

2294
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:09,130
- Really?
 -  Yes.

2295
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:10,600
- Really?
 -  It looks nice.

2296
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:11,840
- What are these?
 -  They look nice.

2297
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,690
They look very nice.

2298
01:22:13,690 --> 01:22:15,230
I am sorry, but that looks better than this.

2299
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,330
(Seok Jin wants to switch.)

2300
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:19,050
(Seok Jin wants to take the souvenir instead.)

2301
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:20,130
It really does.

2302
01:22:20,130 --> 01:22:21,930
You should leave now.

2303
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:24,030
- Move up.
 -  Take your trophy and leave.

2304
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:25,730
Gosh, they look nicer.

2305
01:22:25,730 --> 01:22:27,240
Can't we do this again next week?

2306
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,050
This is really fun.

2307
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:31,560
The first Unluckiest Man is...

2308
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:34,190
Jee Seok Jin! We will see you next week!

2309
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:37,590
(The first Unluckiest Man is Jee Seok Jin.)

2310
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:39,300
Go, Seok Jin!

2311
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:44,830
(One man who is like spring approaches Ji Hyo.)

2312
01:22:44,830 --> 01:22:46,740
Oh, gosh! I can't believe it.

2313
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,460
(She finally meets Bo Gum.)

2314
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:51,500
- I would love that.
 -  I would love that, too.

2315
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:54,030
Can you take me to the shoot?

2316
01:22:54,030 --> 01:22:56,240
(It's every man's crush, Seolhyun.)

2317
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:57,930
This is driving me crazy.

2318
01:22:57,930 --> 01:22:59,070
(She asks him to do her a favour.)

2319
01:22:59,570 --> 01:23:00,630
Gary.

2320
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:02,500
I want to keep this fantasy.

2321
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:04,390
It's nice to meet you!

2322
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:06,390
You want me to shave my beard.

2323
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:08,120
You are a gangster, aren't you?

2324
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:09,240
I can't do that!

2325
01:23:10,370 --> 01:23:11,830
- This is awesome.
 -  Oh dear.

2326
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:12,930
- Is this awesome?
 -  Yes.

2327
01:23:12,930 --> 01:23:14,130
This is unbelievable.

2328
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:15,240
I love it.

2329
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:18,240
(Next week, Strange Spring Outing special is coming up.)

2330
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,000
(Running Man)
