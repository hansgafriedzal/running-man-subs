1
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,800
(The First "I'm Sorry, I Love You" Special)

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,000
(A special project for the 300th episode.)

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,050
- "I'm sorry"?
 -  I'm sorry.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,000
(Some guests had a bad experience on Running Man.)

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,800
- I'm sorry.
 -  I'm sorry.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,860
- I want to apologise to you.
 -  Please accept our apology.

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,700
(Running Man will apologise today.)

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,530
- You're so pretty.
 -  That's too much.

9
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,910
This is too hard.

10
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,520
(They are customised apologies.)

11
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,640
You jerk.

12
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,460
(Will the apologies be accepted?)

13
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,470
Don't hold him.

14
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,270
(They confess the truth for the first time in six years.)

15
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,940
I wasn't healthy, so I was put in a slump.

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,140
I thought I should leave Running Man at this point.

17
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,030
Thank you.

18
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,210
(The Running Man stories will now unfold.)

19
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,070
(It's 8am on the day of filming.)

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,110
(Jae Seok begins the day with a cup of tea.)

21
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,410
(Seok Jin's nose is swollen.)

22
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,670
Shall we go?

23
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,940
(Ji Hyo woke up early today.)

24
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,680
(Let's go)

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,780
- Are we leaving now?
 -  Yes.

26
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,520
(This is how the Running Man members begin their commute.)

27
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,750
The weather is nice.

28
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,340
It's a lovely day.

29
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,510
(Enjoying the spring day, they turn on the radio.)

30
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,810
You're listening to "Beautiful Morning" and I'm Kim Chang Wan.

31
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,880
You must be caught in traffic and feeling tired right now.

32
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,520
I have a letter that will wake you up.

33
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,810
It's a letter from Jee Seok Jin who lives in Bundang-gu...

34
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,820
to Lee Kwang Soo who lives in Geumho-dong.

35
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,720
"Dearest Kwang Soo."

36
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,550
- "This is Seok Jin."
 -  Is this from Seok Jin?

37
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,620
"Do you remember? While we were filming,"

38
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,310
"I told you that no matter how hard you try,"

39
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,520
"you'll only be as handsome as Song Joong Ki's feet."

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,620
"I'm so sorry."

41
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,730
"I never expected the staff would put a foot on your face."

42
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,920
"You're the Prince of Asia. I just wanted to be funny."

43
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,490
It was funny.

44
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,320
"Let's continue to work hard."

45
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,620
"I hope we'll all be happy. From Seok Jin."

46
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,800
Let's listen to a song that speaks Seok Jin's mind.

47
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,250
"A Foot" by Shin Il Soo.

48
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,850
(Laughing)

49
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,650
Is there a song called "A Foot"? Seriously?

50
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,520
What does a foot have to do with me?

51
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,140
This is the happiest foot in the world

52
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,490
I'll read the next letter.

53
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,650
It's a letter from Haha who lives in Mapo-gu.

54
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,980
"Dear Gary. It all started last winter."

55
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,950
"While we were playing a game in the X-Man Special,"

56
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,410
"I asked you if you're a squid."

57
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,660
"Everyone burst into laughter at my joke."

58
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,050
"It's been a few months and everybody calls you a squid now."

59
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,310
(Who are you to call me a squid?)

60
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,420
Did you see it?

61
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,410
(Giggling)

62
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,620
(What is it?)

63
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,510
He is the real squid.

64
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,280
(Meet the squid's friend.)

65
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,250
(It's hard to decide which of the two is uglier.)

66
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,630
Let me read you the last letter.

67
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,650
It's from Kwang Soo, the youngest member of Running Man.

68
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,070
"Dear Haha."

69
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,520
"Do you know what my favourite part of our team dinner is?"

70
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,820
"It's when we switch roles and I get to be older than you."

71
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:48,080
"One day, you said I only have three more chances to do that."

72
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,740
"I've already used all my chances."

73
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,010
"I wasn't able to restrain myself and I used them all."

74
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,330
"It's only April."

75
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,420
"I can't wait to treat you as if you're younger than me."

76
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,010
"I promise I won't waste more chances. I'll see you soon."

77
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,310
- "I'm sorry I treat you like..."
 -  Chang Wan's voice...

78
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,620
makes the stories sound so beautiful.

79
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,310
They're not supposed to be beautiful.

80
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,870
"See you in a bit, smiling. I love you."

81
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,920
I'm touched by the friendship between the Running Man members.

82
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,070
I hope this warmed your hearts on the way to the set.

83
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,780
I'll always cheer for Running Man.

84
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,180
You've listened to "Beautiful Morning" and I am Kim Chang Wan.

85
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,320
I love Chang Wan's voice.

86
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,780
This was nice.

87
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,450
(What will be waiting for them today?)

88
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,570
(The members arrive at SBS.)

89
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,110
Did you listen to the radio on the way here?

90
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,440
- Yes.
 -  It was embarrassing.

91
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,050
I can't look at the person I wrote to in the eye.

92
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,660
- It is a bit embarrassing.
 -  It is.

93
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,800
Haha, will you give Kwang Soo more chances?

94
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,740
- I already gave him enough.
 -  Wasn't it more than 10?

95
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,410
- He doesn't need my permission.
 -  It's a free pass for him.

96
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,850
I can even do it now. Hey!

97
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,470
- Also...
 -  You guys are funny.

98
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,740
- Continue to talk like that.
 -  You should...

99
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,170
pay him for more chances.

100
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,950
- You should pay him.
 -  I accept credit cards.

101
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,380
- Today's theme is...
 -  Yes.

102
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,920
Today's theme is this.

103
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,240
Something's coming down.

104
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,140
(It's a spring special.)

105
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,620
Today's theme is this.

106
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,720
- "I'm sorry?"
 -  "I'm sorry."

107
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,450
Today, we'll shoot the First "I'm Sorry, I Love You" Special.

108
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,090
If there's anyone among our guests...

109
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,840
that you feel sorry to or wish to make things better with,

110
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,540
you'll go apologise to them and do them a favour.

111
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,720
(The members will provide a special apology service.)

112
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,150
Among our guests, I feel sorry for Kwang Soo.

113
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,240
- Why?
 -  Why am I a guest?

114
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,270
- Aren't you a guest?
 -  What are you talking about?

115
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,930
- You've been a guest for six years.
 -  Shouldn't I be accepted by now?

116
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,540
- He's been with us for six years.
 -  That's why I'm sorry.

117
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,840
He always manages to match his clothes with us.

118
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,920
Do you think I prepared these clothes?

119
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,540
Do you think I bought them myself?

120
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,050
You kept coming back for six years.

121
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,540
That's absurd.

122
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,070
You were our first guest and you came every week.

123
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,140
- We couldn't kick you out.
 -  I'm a member.

124
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,780
We're so kind.

125
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,720
(I'm Sorry, I Love You)

126
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,940
(The members visit the guests they feel sorry to.)

127
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,020
There's someone I feel sorry to.

128
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,950
(Feelings of regret begin to form.)

129
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,590
- Haeryung from BESTie.
 -  Exactly. Haeryung.

130
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,940
- I failed to lift her on my back.
 -  I remember.

131
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,770
- That's right.
 -  I didn't succeed.

132
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,010
- Haeryung.
 -  That's right.

133
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,650
- I feel most sorry to her.
 -  I see.

134
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,240
I feel so sorry to G-Dragon as well.

135
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,340
- G-Dragon.
 -  Do you remember?

136
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,290
- I felt sorry, too.
 -  He seemed dispirited later on.

137
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,000
- We should feel sorry for him.
 -  Really.

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,980
G-Dragon was going through a hard time back then.

139
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,280
He was having a hard time.

140
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,640
(Spring flowers are in full bloom in the streets of Samcheong-dong.)

141
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,620
(Today's first guest is shooting a commercial.)

142
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,380
(He's dazzling like the spring weather.)

143
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,150
(It's the popular actor, Park Seo Joon.)

144
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,070
Tell me how the driver is doing!

145
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,450
(He's stolen many hearts with his acting.)

146
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,820
You're so cute.

147
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,130
- How are you feeling?
 -  This is so nice.

148
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,970
(Through his four appearances on Running Man,)

149
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,020
(he has proven himself as an entertainer.)

150
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,610
You don't look like yourself.

151
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,480
You're still handsome.

152
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,570
- Everybody, Seo Joon is here.
 -  Seo Joon!

153
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,010
- I'm sorry!
 -  Seo Joon, we're sorry!

154
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,310
- Seo Joon, I'm sorry!
 -  Seo Joon, I'm sorry.

155
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,640
- It's Park Seo Joon!
 -  What are you sorry for?

156
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,770
(Why are they apologising to Seo Joon?)

157
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,710
- I'm sorry, Seo Joon.
 -  It's good to see you.

158
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,640
- I'm sorry.
 -  You look so handsome.

159
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,710
You're so handsome. Why are you so handsome?

160
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,340
He actually has the best type of face.

161
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,810
- You'll never get sick of him.
 -  No, you won't.

162
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,810
- He only becomes more charming.
 -  By the way,

163
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,340
you've only met Seo Joon as a guest on the show.

164
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,210
But I've watched him film in other places.

165
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,310
- He's a big star.
 -  Wasn't he handsome?

166
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,910
There were these huge umbrellas covering him the whole time.

167
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,210
- That's amazing.
 -  We're sorry.

168
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,270
- We have to hold it ourselves.
 -  Does anybody have an umbrella?

169
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,640
- He's going to get sunburned.
 -  Seo Joon.

170
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,370
- Seo Joon, we're sorry.
 -  Why are you...

171
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,220
treating me nicer than usual?

172
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,970
(They're suddenly treating him nicely.)

173
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,070
Make sure his face doesn't get covered by the shade.

174
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,220
- It's covering his face already.
 -  I'm sorry, Seo Joon.

175
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,310
- Seo Joon!
 -  Thank you.

176
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,390
We should have done this for you earlier.

177
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,570
Let me hold this for you. I have so much energy left over.

178
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,890
He has a lot of energy remaining.

179
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,470
This is Seo Joon's fifth appearance on our show.

180
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,840
- Already?
 -  Really?

181
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,610
- He's appeared a lot on this show.
 -  No kidding.

182
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,510
And every time he was on it, he always worked hard.

183
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,270
I'm pretty sure you all know already,

184
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,890
- but let me read this for you.
 -  Go ahead.

185
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,890
"Park Seo Joon is like family to Running Man."

186
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,040
Isn't that just our opinion?

187
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,570
"During the winter, we made you walk..."

188
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,750
"barefoot in the icy water."

189
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,770
"And even worse, during the Beautiful Youth Race,"

190
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,040
"your name was mistakenly written as Lee Seo Joon."

191
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,170
"We sincerely apologise."

192
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,640
- He deserves an apology.
 -  We were wrong.

193
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,140
That's like saying Park Jae Seok instead of Yu Jae Seok.

194
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,070
- That was bad.
 -  We must apologise.

195
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,410
Seo Joon, we're really sorry for the mistake with the captions.

196
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,470
Mistakes like that happen.

197
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,740
I was okay with it, but my parents...

198
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,050
(My parents were hurt.)

199
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,840
That's even more hurtful.

200
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,580
You changed my father's last name to "Lee".

201
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,470
- You guys should know better.
 -  You hurt his family.

202
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,620
- Let's toss him in the air, then.
 -  All right.

203
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,570
- What?
 -  All of a sudden?

204
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,970
- Seo Joon.
 -  No, we owe you this much.

205
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,880
- Come here, Seo Joon.
 -  Come here.

206
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,940
- We have to do this for you.
 -  Don't worry.

207
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,780
(This is the best way to apologise.)

208
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,420
- In 1, 2, 3.
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

209
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,450
- In 1, 2, 3.
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

210
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,940
- One more time.
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

211
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,240
(This looks like a World Cup celebration.)

212
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,240
- Be careful.
 -  That was good.

213
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,140
- That came out of nowhere.
 -  No, it's because...

214
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,010
I don't know if this is enough to receive forgiveness.

215
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,740
Seo Joon got frostbitten last time.

216
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,950
I was in the middle of shooting a drama at the time.

217
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,300
I ended up with a bad flu the next day.

218
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,470
It was cold that day.

219
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,710
We walked barefoot for that episode.

220
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,570
The ground was covered in snow and we walked on it with bare feet.

221
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,710
- It wasn't even for a short time.
 -  Exactly.

222
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,770
It was very cold but Seo Joon acted like he was fine.

223
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,410
Why did you do that?

224
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,940
- Because it was my first time.
 -  It was his first time on the show.

225
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,510
- He wanted to try his best.
 -  I wanted to do my best.

226
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,840
- That's why.
 -  You're the best.

227
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,740
It was freezing, right? He kept on saying he wasn't cold.

228
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,710
- Let's take care of his feet today.
 -  Let's wipe them for him.

229
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,770
- Let's do it together.
 -  I hope it's not too late.

230
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,750
- Let's wash his feet.
 -  All right.

231
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,220
Let's get ready.

232
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,840
- Seriously?
 -  Come on over.

233
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,170
- Come here.
 -  Don't feel troubled, Seo Joon.

234
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,110
We thought about bathing you, too.

235
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,240
- This doesn't look right.
 -  Have a seat.

236
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,840
- Have a seat.
 -  Sit down, Seo Joon.

237
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,910
This is a full set.

238
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,920
- Seo Joon, take off your shoes.
 -  Take them off.

239
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,840
I'm sorry, Seo Joon.

240
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,870
- I didn't know.
 -  I'm wearing socks.

241
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,410
- It's okay. You can take them off.
 -  That's not a problem.

242
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,540
- Just take them off.
 -  His feet are handsome, too.

243
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,510
- Get comfortable.
 -  Don't be shy. It's all right.

244
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,410
It looks like you got a pedicure.

245
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,170
Look at your feet.

246
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,410
- They're so white.
 -  Why are your feet so white?

247
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,310
Look, there's a beauty mark between his first and second toe.

248
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,870
- Let's wash between his toes.
 -  Is this right?

249
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,170
This is how you do it.

250
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:24,140
- During my lifetime
 -  During my lifetime

251
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,110
(They begin their apology with a song.)

252
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,440
- There's one thing
 -  There's one thing

253
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,250
- He was frostbitten.
 -  I must do

254
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,470
You know what?

255
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,740
You need to release tension in other areas as well.

256
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,370
(This is too burdensome for him.)

257
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,040
- Even if I stand
 -  You have to massage here.

258
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,140
(In apology, they pour their hearts...)

259
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,630
(into relieving Seo Joon's stress.)

260
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,740
(Foot massages are good for your health.)

261
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,480
- If one pine needle falls
 -  If one pine needle falls

262
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,640
- The tears will flow
 -  We're sorry.

263
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,440
(Seo Joon must be uncomfortable.)

264
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,640
(He's dazed.)

265
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,840
Isn't this refreshing?

266
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,170
- Do you like it?
 -  Seo Joon.

267
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,910
- Weren't we bad?
 -  Really.

268
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,040
(The members put their all into the apology.)

269
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,050
Your feet look nice, Seo Joon.

270
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,140
(Hard feelings have been resolved.)

271
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,540
(But his eyes are losing focus.)

272
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,570
- Isn't this refreshing?
 -  Do you like it?

273
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,870
Aren't you happy, Seo Joon?

274
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,450
Yes, sure.

275
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,980
Your feet look nice, Seo Joon.

276
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,820
- That's it.
 -  Am I hurting you?

277
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,710
- Look at his feet.
 -  Stop feeling uncomfortable. Enjoy.

278
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,540
- Stay still.
 -  Pretend there's nothing here.

279
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,270
- Don't look.
 -  There are so many cameras here.

280
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,020
Seo Joon, let's take a photo now.

281
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,350
With his feet?

282
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,580
(Seo Joon's feet look the prettiest.)

283
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,750
(This kind of photo shoot is a first.)

284
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,480
This photo should be titled, "His foot is Most Handsome."

285
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,240
- We have to wash it again.
 -  We should.

286
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,840
- Thanks so much.
 -  Handle it with care.

287
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,840
- Your feet will have a nice scent.
 -  Sorry.

288
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,400
We're really sorry.

289
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,780
(Kissing)

290
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,180
Hey!

291
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,540
You went too far. Don't make him feel uncomfortable.

292
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,280
That made me feel very uncomfortable.

293
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,620
That was a good one. Good one, Seo Joon.

294
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,610
Go away, you punk!

295
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,650
Get lost!

296
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,110
He kissed Seo Joon's foot.

297
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,570
- What was that for?
 -  Why would you do that?

298
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,010
- That was unnecessary.
 -  What was that for?

299
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,470
He's uncomfortable.

300
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,520
Here are your socks.

301
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,140
- Your socks.
 -  He'll feel uncomfortable again.

302
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,540
Why? What's wrong with putting on his socks?

303
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,210
- That's okay.
 -  He'll put them on by himself.

304
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,510
It doesn't smell bad at all.

305
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,180
- Don't smell them.
 -  He'll feel uncomfortable.

306
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,240
- It doesn't smell bad.
 -  Why would you smell it?

307
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,440
- Why would you smell it?
 -  Try it.

308
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,500
- Smell it.
 -  I'll take it.

309
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,110
- His socks...
 -  Move over.

310
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,110
His socks smell like flowers.

311
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,140
They smell like black locust flowers.

312
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,110
- What do you mean by flowers?
 -  They smell like flowers.

313
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,540
(His feet went through a lot more than before.)

314
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,570
- I'm getting sweaty.
 -  That was good.

315
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,040
This is nice. It puts us at ease.

316
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,010
Since it's time for lunch, we'll serve food.

317
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,440
- That sounds like a good idea.
 -  Yes!

318
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,610
That sounds good.

319
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,110
- They're three-layered lunch boxes.
 -  Look at the lunch boxes.

320
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,140
That looks great.

321
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,950
- That looks good.
 -  No kidding.

322
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,100
This is great.

323
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,640
- You should sit, Seo Joon.
 -  Goodness.

324
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,840
- Sit back down.
 -  Just stay still.

325
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,370
You should stay still.

326
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,610
- Don't do anything.
 -  I'll get upset if you move.

327
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,550
- I'll get upset, too.
 -  We won't just watch.

328
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,150
This is nice.

329
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,080
- Have some.
 -  Thank you for the food.

330
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,980
- Aren't you guys having some?
 -  I'm going to take some.

331
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,960
Me, too.

332
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,950
(There are salads, sandwiches and side dishes.)

333
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,080
The sandwiches are delicious.

334
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,370
Seo Joon, do your feet feel refreshed?

335
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,240
Yes, I'm not planning on washing them tonight.

336
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,410
- All right.
 -  They'll feel better.

337
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,150
You can take some of our energy.

338
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,710
(Laughing)

339
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,630
Look who's talking.

340
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,610
Stop making him angry.

341
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,770
- You're annoying him.
 -  Why?

342
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,050
Aren't you happy, Seo Joon? Take all our good energy.

343
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,570
- Sorry.
 -  Seo Joon.

344
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,350
Seok Jin keeps telling me that people think he's in his 30s.

345
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,510
Isn't that exaggerated?

346
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,920
Don't people think you're in your 20s?

347
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,080
- I'm in my 20s.
 -  Really?

348
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,640
(We're all embarrassed of Seok Jin.)

349
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,140
- I'm sorry.
 -  Seok Jin.

350
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,650
Why do you keep upsetting him?

351
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,470
Is there a mission you must complete?

352
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,110
- Are you a spy? Should I rip this?
 -  What is it really?

353
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,340
What's your role today?

354
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,440
I'm learning so much about Seo Joon today.

355
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,420
What is he saying?

356
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,380
Stop talking.

357
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,310
I don't know how to resolve this situation.

358
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,980
(It's hard to apologise.)

359
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,510
Before we send him off, we have something else for him.

360
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,980
Last time, he was Ji Hyo's partner.

361
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,740
- But she gave him a hard time.
 -  That's right.

362
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,640
- I'm sorry, Seo Joon.
 -  Ji Hyo didn't treat him well.

363
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,150
(During that episode...)

364
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,150
It's okay.

365
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,340
You're really bad at describing things.

366
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,170
(Ji Hyo scolded Seo Joon that day.)

367
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,110
As an expression of our apology,

368
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,570
- we'll replay charades again.
 -  Okay.

369
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,880
- I'm really bad at this game.
 -  Whoever doesn't guess it right...

370
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,520
will get a flick in the forehead.

371
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,740
That sounds good.

372
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,270
Seo Joon's really bad at this game, though.

373
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,040
No matter how he acts it out, you must get it right. If you don't,

374
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,410
the penalty is on you.

375
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,510
- So we have to guess it, right?
 -  He won't get punished, then?

376
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,740
- No, he's exempt.
 -  Right, we put you through a lot.

377
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,520
Whoever gets the wrong answer will get a flick in the forehead.

378
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,350
Let's go, Jong Kook.

379
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,540
- Can we talk?
 -  I think it'll be hard.

380
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,640
Seo Joon, we would love to hit Jong Kook's forehead.

381
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,370
- Can you make it extra hard?
 -  Hold on.

382
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,840
- How should I do this?
 -  Make it hard.

383
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,510
Get set, go!

384
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,970
(Spring)

385
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,070
- Hurry.
 -  I can't think of anything.

386
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,170
Oh, dear.

387
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,470
- There are five seconds left.
 -  Can you pause the time?

388
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,970
- He doesn't know what to do.
 -  Either way, it's not his fault.

389
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,880
- But he needs more time.
 - Time's up.

390
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,770
- Okay.
 -  How...

391
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,410
How was I supposed to act this out?

392
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,940
- It's not his fault.
 -  That was a difficult question.

393
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,820
- What was I supposed to do?
 -  It's still our fault.

394
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,070
(Jong Kook receives the punishment!)

395
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,210
- Let's watch.
 -  Isn't Seo Joon supposed to do it?

396
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,320
Seo Joon is doing it. Why are you guys getting close?

397
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,170
Get away! He's supposed to do it. Come on, Seo Joon.

398
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,540
- I can't hit you.
 -  It's okay. Go ahead.

399
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,840
- We'll do it for you.
 -  Just flick your finger.

400
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,570
- We can show you how to do it.
 -  Right.

401
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,440
I'll just show him how to do it.

402
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,510
Sure, I'll show him then.

403
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,020
(Sure, I'll show him.)

404
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,140
Watch me. Reveal his forehead...

405
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,210
Slap like this.

406
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,470
(Slapping hard)

407
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,140
- That's the way.
 -  That looks nice.

408
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,650
- No, that's not how you do it.
 -  Yes, it is.

409
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,810
- He did it right.
 -  No, hold on a second.

410
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,140
- That's how you should flick.
 -  Hold on a second.

411
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,510
- Hold on and take a seat.
 -  If you...

412
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,110
- If you don't know how to flick,
 -  Okay, show me.

413
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,210
I will show you. Take a look.

414
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,170
You just pull the hair back and...

415
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,440
Slap.

416
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,800
This is the way. Got it?

417
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,440
We should hurry up.

418
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,270
- I'd like to give it a try.
 -  Seo Joon.

419
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,340
It's okay. Give it a try.

420
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,140
Stretch your hand wide to make the sound louder.

421
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,310
Stretch your hand wide.

422
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,690
- How can I...
 -  You can do it.

423
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,840
- Why not?
 -  Come on.

424
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,290
- Give it a try.
 -  Come on, Seo Joon.

425
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,480
Slap hard.

426
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,360
- Okay then.
 -  Right.

427
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,640
Let me pull back more hair.

428
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,910
(Just a little bit more)

429
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,120
- That's it.
 -  Good.

430
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,240
I'm sorry.

431
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,470
- It's all right.
 -  That's okay, Seo Joon.

432
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,710
- But I must slap you properly.
 -  That's right.

433
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,090
- Sure.
 -  Yes. Slap him properly.

434
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,140
(Chilled)

435
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,780
- I'll count to three.
 -  Go, Seo Joon.

436
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,360
Come on. Just slap him.

437
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,850
(Slapping)

438
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,650
(High five)

439
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,590
Don't grab him. Don't touch him.

440
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,710
- Let him be.
 -  Seo Joon.

441
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,940
- Leave him.
 -  Don't look at him.

442
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,320
- Turn around.
 -  Don't look.

443
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,730
We have to make guesses.

444
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,140
- Seo Joon, go ahead.
 -  Give us the next word.

445
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,270
- I'm taking a look.
 -  What are you doing?

446
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,470
- Let's move on.
 -  That was loud.

447
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,520
Let's move on.

448
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,130
Next one.

449
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,150
What is this?

450
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,780
The sound was too loud.

451
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,640
- That was really loud.
 -  You did well.

452
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,570
- That was fine.
 -  Good hit, Seo Joon.

453
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,650
- Seo Joon did it.
 -  That was nice.

454
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,380
(Right in his forehead)

455
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,370
- He really did it.
 -  It makes me feel good.

456
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,140
- I feel good.
 -  That was a big slap.

457
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,710
- I'm sorry.
 -  That's fine.

458
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,270
- Wow.
 -  Well done.

459
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,840
Well done, Seo Joon.

460
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,110
That really was good.

461
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,240
I didn't expect such sound.

462
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,110
Feel free to slap others too.

463
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,350
- Okay. Next.
 -  Who is the next person?

464
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,370
- It's you, Kwang Soo. Right?
 -  Yes, it is.

465
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,450
I'm going to get this right.

466
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,970
- Okay.
 -  Please do.

467
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,160
Ready.

468
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,340
Hold on.

469
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,610
- Okay.
 -  Be casual.

470
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,470
- All right.
 -  I will get it.

471
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,610
(Both seem to be determined.)

472
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,280
- Ready, set..
 -  Did you see it?

473
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,480
- Yes, I did.
 -  Start.

474
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,170
- Is this the one?
 -  Yes.

475
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,150
(Squid)

476
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,850
Squid... Squid...

477
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,120
(Master of Cheating)

478
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,230
(What? An onigiri?)

479
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,720
You really are...

480
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,850
Squid.

481
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,710
(Squid)

482
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,840
- No, that's too late.
 -  Here, take a seat.

483
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,250
(He was close but timed out.)

484
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,080
- Hey, Jae Seok.
 -  It's over. Isn't it?

485
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,310
Can you slap him instead?

486
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,970
- How about Haha?
 -  Yes. Haha is good.

487
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,830
- Will Haha slap me?
 -  No. Not Haha.

488
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,640
I'd like to learn how to slap.

489
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,030
All right. I'll teach you.

490
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,110
- Put some water on your hand.
 -  Water is too much.

491
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,910
(Haha puts water on his hand to enhance the pain.)

492
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,080
That will give him a nice slap.

493
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,110
- A big slap.
 -  And shake off excess water.

494
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,220
Shake off water. Good.

495
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,990
- He has a wide forehead.
 -  Hold his hair back.

496
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,800
- Hold his hair.
 -  There.

497
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,310
Open your arms. Good.

498
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,320
I'd rather take a quick hit.

499
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,780
I think so, too.

500
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,280
Ready.

501
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,240
(Slapping)

502
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,470
(Ouch)

503
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,650
He collapsed.

504
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,540
(That was really loud.)

505
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,650
Let's take a look.

506
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,620
That doesn't seem right.

507
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,650
He slapped your skull inside.

508
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,170
What is this?

509
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,400
Why does the back of my head hurt?

510
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,810
He slapped your skull, not your skin.

511
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,480
I was slapped front, but the back of my head hurts.

512
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,640
- That's funny.
 -  Because he slapped your skull.

513
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,810
- I see.
 -  That's why, Kwang Soo.

514
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,280
Okay. And here comes the last person, Ji Hyo.

515
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,500
Don't spare your hands because it's Ji Hyo.

516
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,740
- Don't.
 -  Actually, we are here...

517
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,510
- because of Ji Hyo.
 -  That's right.

518
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,640
- Seo Joon, come forward.
 -  I'm so sorry, Seo Joon.

519
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,070
- No, I'm fine.
 -  I'm sorry.

520
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,650
- How can I do this?
 -  Will she get it right?

521
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,310
You are a genius if you get this.

522
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,470
(It must be a difficult word.)

523
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,640
Set, start.

524
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,970
(Australopithecus)

525
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,760
She looks like she got it.

526
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,470
- He's really good.
 -  Tyrannosaurus.

527
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,740
- She's almost there.
 -  What did you say?

528
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,230
- Tyrannosaurus.
 -  That was close.

529
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,350
- He suddenly stood up.
 -  Oh, is it...

530
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,080
Is it...

531
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,810
(He walked erect as a hint. Can she guess the answer?)

532
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:38,870
Is it human?

533
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,410
(Human)

534
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,340
- Evolution. You know, evolution.
 -  You're close.

535
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,040
Can't you remember the word?

536
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,580
- Oh, what is it?
 -  Remember the word.

537
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,510
- Say the word.
 -  She doesn't know.

538
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,650
Oh goodness.

539
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,810
That was close.

540
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:56,520
Oh, it's Australiapithecus.

541
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,110
- What?
 -  Australia?

542
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,640
(Did human originate from Australia?)

543
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,840
- Australia?
 -  So did we originate from there?

544
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,170
- From Australia?
 -  What's Australiapithecus?

545
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,580
- No way.
 -  Australiapithecus.

546
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,420
That didn't make any sense.

547
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,820
How about Austriapithecus?

548
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,150
- All right. It's your turn.
 -  Okay.

549
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,650
- We are all here to apologise.
 -  Yes.

550
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,550
I'll go easy on you.

551
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,750
- I will slap you on three.
 -  Okay.

552
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,840
- You'd better close your eyes.
 -  I'm okay.

553
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,920
- You won't?
 -  No.

554
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,620
(Slapping)

555
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,910
It's just for fun.

556
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,070
What is wrong with you?

557
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,090
What's the problem?

558
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,480
- Where are you going?
 -  That's scary.

559
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,050
What are you doing?

560
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,250
Hey, you. Come here.

561
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,210
No, Ji Hyo. No.

562
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,940
(Let me put an end to this.)

563
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,040
Calm down, Ji Hyo.

564
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,020
- Calm down. Patience, Ji Hyo.
 -  Hey, you. Come on.

565
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,250
Patience, Ji Hyo.

566
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:48,960
Calm down, Ji Hyo.

567
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,120
- Wow. Kwang Soo.
 -  Ji Hyo.

568
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,110
(Scared)

569
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,510
Calm down, Ji Hyo.

570
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,940
- Calm down.
 -  That was funny.

571
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,210
(Kwang Soo unleashed her inner self.)

572
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,970
That was really scary.

573
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,970
(That's how they get along.)

574
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,250
All right.

575
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,930
This is for Seo Joon.

576
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,470
We are going around to apologise today.

577
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,510
I'm worried we might be hurting each other's feelings instead.

578
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,860
We'll see how things will turn out.

579
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,820
- We will see.
 -  All right. Seo Joon.

580
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,640
- Yes.
 -  Please accept our apology.

581
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,420
- I accept.
 -  Thank you.

582
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,950
Have a bite of an apple.

583
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,470
- Should I?
 -  Yes.

584
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,640
(Biting an apple shows that he accepted the apology.)

585
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,070
(That was a big bite.)

586
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,150
He accepted it.

587
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,710
- Show yourself again in the show.
 -  Probably as a producer.

588
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,910
- We will surely entertain you.
 -  We will.

589
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,170
- We will do our best.
 -  Without making any mistake.

590
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,510
- So please show yourself again.
 -  Please.

591
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,040
- Please call me later.
 -  Thank you.

592
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,210
You are cool, Seo Joon.

593
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,740
- Sorry, Seo Joon.
 -  I am sorry.

594
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,910
- We're sorry, Seo Joon.
 -  Thank you.

595
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,140
- Thank you.
 -  I love you, Seo Joon.

596
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,570
I won't blame you next time.

597
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,780
(I'm Sorry, I Love You.)

598
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,720
She was in my team and I felt so sorry to her.

599
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,810
She had a tough day.

600
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:56,880
She is a mother of three children.

601
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,940
She hadn't been on TV for a few years.

602
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,840
She hadn't been for a long time,

603
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,210
so we hoped her to have a memorable time with us.

604
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,210
Probably we should have taken better care of her.

605
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,980
But at that time,

606
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,820
she had a really tough day with us.

607
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,640
- We had not much to talk.
 -  There she is.

608
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,220
- There she is.
 -  Hello.

609
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:19,040
(She...)

610
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,870
(has arrived.)

611
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,470
(Who is today's second guest?)

612
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,910
- Hello.
 -  I'm sorry.

613
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,550
(She's the popular actress, Lee Yo Won.)

614
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,840
(An outstanding actress)

615
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,310
(She showed herself in dramas, movies, adverts and more.)

616
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,980
(She had a tough time on Running Man.)

617
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,180
- Hello.
 -  I'm sorry.

618
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,370
- Hello, Yo Won.
 -  Hello.

619
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,350
- Hello.
 -  Hello. Nice to see you.

620
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,210
- Hello.
 -  Hello, Yo Won.

621
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,880
- You've lost weight.
 -  Yes. I've been busy.

622
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,140
- She's in a drama now.
 -  She's been acting recently.

623
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,640
She's acting a hot-tempered character.

624
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,010
(She's acting a hot-tempered character.)

625
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,960
Yo Won had a really tough time...

626
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,870
on Running Man last time. Was it your first entertainment show?

627
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,480
Was it your first time?

628
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,370
- I had been on really old ones.
 -  Really old ones?

629
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:07,620
She had been on really old ones and showed herself on Running Man.

630
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,550
And had a really tough time.

631
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,340
You were almost exhausted, weren't you?

632
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,740
You had some hard time in the swimming pool.

633
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,040
- Yes.
 -  In the swimming pool.

634
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,490
We're sorry, so we're going around providing Apology Service.

635
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,740
- So we'd like to apologise.
 -  Okay.

636
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,610
(You have my ears.)

637
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,880
"Running Man was your first entertainment show."

638
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,490
"We handed you many short scripts,"

639
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,010
"and gave you many troubles."

640
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:36,410
"Your hair became all scruffy throughout the show."

641
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,350
"We're sorry that your image as an actress was tarnished."

642
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,640
- We are so sorry.
 -  Sorry.

643
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,170
Isn't it normal to show such images in entertainment shows?

644
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,250
Isn't it?

645
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,150
- Aren't we here to apologise?
 -  Keep your words to yourself.

646
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,760
Even men would have found the game difficult.

647
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,170
And you participated in the game.

648
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,260
She was holding on to her clothes really tightly.

649
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,920
We have brought this for you today.

650
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,840
(The memory of the day...

651
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,470
that she doesn't want to remember.)

652
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,420
You had a tough day.

653
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,940
- You looked like a prisoner.
 -  It's because...

654
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,310
- she was totally exhausted.
 -  Like a prisoner on the run.

655
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,960
On that day,

656
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,520
- I was really fatigued.
 -  You were.

657
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,640
I felt really awkward at first because there were so many cameras.

658
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,620
I usually see 1 or 2 cameras at once.

659
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,610
I was so aware of the cameras at first.

660
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,210
But later when I was like that,

661
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,400
- they were just out of my sight.
 -  That happens.

662
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,440
- Because you were so tired.
 -  I couldn't see any.

663
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,010
I still remember her when Haha was leading the way.

664
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,740
Haha found a way and she said "Well done!"

665
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,840
Yes, right. She did.

666
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,540
- Yes, she did.
 -  She said "Well done!"

667
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,910
That was really impressive.

668
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,280
- So we called her mum.
 -  Yes, we called her mum.

669
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,740
Step forward and sit on the couch.

670
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,270
(She showed that she was warm-hearted.)

671
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,040
Go forward. A bit more.

672
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,310
- There.
 -  Nice. Good job.

673
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,550
(Well done)

674
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,050
Anyway, Yo Won is here today.

675
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,110
- And we must make our apologies.
 -  We do.

676
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,440
- We must apologise.
 -  We are here for it.

677
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,470
First, we should make her stand out the most.

678
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,840
Just make Gary sit next to her.

679
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,410
- What should we do?
 -  We don't need to do anything.

680
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:07,240
- She needs to sit still.
 -  That will be enough.

681
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,340
- That is...
 -  To be honest...

682
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,970
Not many will suit these accessories.

683
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,270
- You look nice, Kwang Soo.
 -  Look at Kwang Soo.

684
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,440
(What are they doing?)

685
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,540
All right.

686
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,550
- You look amazing.
 -  That hair suits you well.

687
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,140
(His face is like a weapon.)

688
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,110
- Look at Gary.
 -  That doesn't look good at all.

689
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,240
He looks like he could fight well.

690
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,010
He really looks scruffy. A scruffy beggar.

691
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,640
They are all weird.

692
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
- What is this?
 -  Are we back in Joseon Dynasty?

693
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,880
- You look like you're on a war.
 -  I'm afraid to see Gary's face.

694
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,410
He is outstanding.

695
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,580
(He is outstanding.)

696
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,320
- Are you the runaway slave?
 -  More like a beggar I think.

697
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,470
That's amazing.

698
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,840
Today, Yo Won must be...

699
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,650
in the centre and highlighted the most.

700
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,140
- That's really nice.
 -  It is.

701
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,970
That's really good. Look, Yo Won.

702
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,340
- It's very bright.
 -  You look gorgeous.

703
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,720
- Thank you.
 -  What we're doing now is...

704
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,170
It doesn't look like we are making her stand out.

705
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,920
It's more like she's taking us in and looking after us.

706
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:03,240
- You're not at an award ceremony.
 -  Right.

707
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,940
She was kind enough to encompass us all.

708
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,320
- We look like aliens.
 -  I really mean it.

709
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,370
- Gosh.
 -  We should make weird looks.

710
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,740
- Whoever looks normal gets penalty.
 -  Okay.

711
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,190
Loser will get a hit on his forehead.

712
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,640
One, two, three.

713
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,380
(Feeling sorry, they try hard to make weird looks on their faces.)

714
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,230
(We are still humans.)

715
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:28,780
Pick one person who looks fine in the photo. He'll receive a penalty.

716
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:32,840
- This is very hard...
 -  We all have unique characters.

717
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,310
because some people don't even have to try to look ugly.

718
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:40,420
- Right.
 -  So who is that?

719
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,320
Gary.

720
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,270
(It's obvious.)

721
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,740
I am jealous.

722
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,310
- You're the best.
 -  He was born that way.

723
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,640
- We can never beat him.
 -  Wasn't that a bit unfair?

724
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,620
Please choose the one who you found hard to judge.

725
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,740
- Please choose one.
 -  We did our best...

726
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,380
- to make ugly faces.
 -  This is really difficult.

727
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,610
It's okay. Just name one.

728
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:01,770
(This is hard.)

729
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,050
Seok Jin and Haha.

730
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,240
(They are ugly. But they're not ugly enough.)

731
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,560
Wow.

732
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,640
- Should I pick just one person?
 -  Yes, please.

733
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,640
I really tried my best.

734
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,040
- Please be subjective.
 -  This is really hard.

735
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,850
You should be subjective so that the viewers can agree with you.

736
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,940
I am sorry.

737
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,110
- She said sorry to you.
 -  Is it Seok Jin?

738
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,170
(Seok Jin gets the penalty.)

739
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:25,840
- Yes!
 -  Don't be sorry.

740
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,880
- I am fine. I am.
 -  I am so sorry.

741
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,350
- I think Haha tried to look stupid.
 -  Yes.

742
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,210
But I look ambiguous, don't I?

743
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:40,070
- No, I mean... A little ambiguous.
 -  You look creepy here.

744
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:44,170
If I can make Yo Won happy by sacrificing myself...

745
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,940
Please do not use such noble word as "sacrifice" here.

746
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,510
That's not what we call sacrifice.

747
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,740
I want Yo Won to hit my forehead.

748
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,420
- Then, would you do that for him?
 -  Okay. Let's do that.

749
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,040
Hit him hard.

750
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,010
She stood up right away because she wants to hit me.

751
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,510
- My slaps tend to be powerful.
 -  It is okay.

752
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,980
Seok Jin got used to it because he has been hit a lot.

753
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,910
- Take a seat.
 -  Don't worry.

754
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,070
- I am okay. Hit me.
 -  So do I hit like this?

755
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,640
- Yes, hit him hard.
 -  That is right.

756
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,910
- I'm sorry.
 -  Don't be.

757
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,070
Please take your ring off.

758
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,170
- I did.
 -  Be careful with your bracelet.

759
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,950
- Seok Jin is kneeling down.
 -  She's like my high school teacher.

760
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:21,120
- Yo Won, he will be okay.
 -  Just hit him hard.

761
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:25,350
Get ready. One, two...

762
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:29,430
- I've never hit anyone before.
 -  She is a talented actress.

763
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:32,140
- Now or never.
 -  Use your palm and hit him.

764
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,940
(Hard spanking)

765
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,850
- You were good.
 -  Good job.

766
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,810
- It is okay.
 -  You did a good job.

767
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,210
- She was amazing.
 -  My goodness.

768
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:46,510
- It's okay.
 -  My hand hurts.

769
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,840
- He is okay.
 -  Gosh.

770
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,640
- It's fine.
 -  He's okay.

771
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,080
(Apology Service succeeded.)

772
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:59,030
We've changed the game Yo Won played before a bit.

773
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:03,010
We'll put a cup on each member's head.

774
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,980
Then, Yo Won will wear an eye mask and pour water into the cup.

775
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,820
If the water in your cup is between these two lines, you succeed.

776
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:17,220
But if you fail, you'll get the water splashed on your face.

777
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,470
- Then, as I was in the same team...
 -  You were in the same team.

778
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:24,170
She was like the mother figure in our team before.

779
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,880
Let us three, me, Haha and Yo Won play.

780
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,270
- Then, we will go first.
 -  Mothers have keen senses.

781
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,120
- Yo Won must be good at this.
 -  You can do it.

782
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,770
- Okay.
 -  Get ready.

783
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,610
- Yo Won, be confident.
 -  Take your hands off.

784
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,960
Okay.

785
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,740
- Jae Seok should call for stop.
 -  Yes, Jae Seok calls for stop.

786
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,070
Start!

787
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,480
Good. You're doing great.

788
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,450
Wow, you're good.

789
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:52,040
Great. Good.

790
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,630
Stop. Stop.

791
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:54,770
(Water overflows a bit.)

792
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,710
(Although it overflew, Yo Won skilfully topped the cup up.)

793
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,960
This is amazing.

794
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,370
- Look now.
 -  Take your eye mask off.

795
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,710
- It's amazing.
 -  It's unbelievable.

796
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:05,010
- Wow.
 -  You did a great job.

797
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,870
- Wow.
 -  Isn't this good enough?

798
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,040
- Please dash water over his face.
 -  It's still a fail though.

799
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,040
- Is this a fail?
 -  Does he get water splashed?

800
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,170
- A full cup is a fail.
 -  I was so close.

801
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,720
- It's Haha's turn now.
 -  Nice.

802
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,220
Here is your cup.

803
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:23,340
- Please get ready.
 -  She is good.

804
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,720
- Okay.
 -  I'm sorry.

805
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,620
- Start.
 -  Hold the cup tight.

806
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,010
(She pours water without hesitation.)

807
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,180
(Gushing)

808
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,120
(Water flows over Haha's face.)

809
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,770
(I was wet too.)

810
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,940
- Stop. Stop!
 -  That's it.

811
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,510
(Wait)

812
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,510
- Can I take the cup down?
 -  You succeeded.

813
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:47,510
- You made it!
 -  Success!

814
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,910
Gosh, why are you interrupting me?

815
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:53,190
(Splashing)

816
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,040
(You deserve a water slap.)

817
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,310
Haha.

818
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:59,040
- This is so funny.
 -  It was a mistake!

819
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,610
- You know it was a mistake!
 -  But he could've succeeded.

820
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:03,510
- I did it out of habit.
 -  What are you doing?

821
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,770
I'm going to wipe up the water.

822
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,820
- Kwang Soo wants the splash too.
 -  Yo Won.

823
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,080
It's Kwang Soo's turn.

824
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,770
- I think I know when to stop now.
 -  Okay.

825
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:14,340
- It takes about 4.5 seconds.
 -  You have only 1 chance.

826
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,780
- I timed it. It took 4.5 seconds.
 -  Get ready.

827
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:20,470
I think it was five seconds. Good. Start when I tell you so.

828
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,740
- Okay.
 -  Start when I tell you to start.

829
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,320
I didn't tell you to start yet.

830
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,270
Can she start without me telling her to start?

831
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,650
Start!

832
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:38,020
One, two, three, four, five. Stop.

833
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:45,750
One, two, three, four, five. Stop.

834
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,450
(Stop now)

835
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,880
(Kwang Soo took a short shower.)

836
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,170
- Good job.
 -  My goodness.

837
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,860
- She watered you.
 -  You did a good job.

838
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,030
- She watered you a lot.
 -  Wow.

839
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,970
I didn't touch his cup.

840
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,810
- Jae Seok will receive penalty.
 -  Only me?

841
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,040
I am sure you've shot this scene a lot.

842
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,480
- I've done it.
 -  In "Ms Temper and Nam Jung Gi"...

843
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,170
I'm sure you're familiar with these scenes.

844
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,440
- Was it the first episode?
 -  To Mr Kim.

845
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,850
You did it to Mr Kim.

846
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,620
You jerk.

847
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,180
(Yo Won splashed water over Mr Kim's face, pleasing the viewers.)

848
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,580
(Would you present such impressive splash to Jae Seok too?)

849
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,170
Ready, action!

850
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,710
Gosh, you're so pathetic.

851
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,270
Why did you come to my office? You're annoying.

852
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,700
You shouldn't have come here.

853
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,780
(Splashing)

854
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,920
(You jerk)

855
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,620
(Yo Won hits Jae Seok hard with the water!)

856
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,140
(Yo Won, it's all my fault.)

857
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,220
- You did a great job.
 -  Wow.

858
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,330
- I was really frightened.
 -  You did good.

859
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,910
- You did great.
 -  Good, good.

860
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,550
(Apology Service is completed.)

861
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,210
- This is a gift.
 -  Apples?

862
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:56,410
- Yo Won, we're really sorry.
 -  Thank you.

863
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,370
- Thanks for accepting it.
 -  Thank you.

864
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:01,340
- Thanks.
 -  We're sorry, Yo Won.

865
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,040
- It means you accept our apology.
 -  Right, take a bite.

866
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,010
This is clean.

867
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,710
(Hesitating)

868
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,650
I am sorry, but are you mad at us?

869
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,840
- You accept our apology, right?
 -  Yes.

870
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,980
I'll never forget the look on her face.

871
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,870
- I was really...
 -  "You jerk."

872
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,180
(Her eyes were scarier than the water splash.)

873
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,480
- So, do I eat this apple?
 -  Yes, please.

874
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,780
Please take a bite.

875
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,240
(She bites the apple.)

876
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,490
My teeth are weak.

877
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,140
(Yo Won's teeth are too weak.)

878
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,510
- Don't do it.
 -  Don't bite it then.

879
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,440
- Yo Won, don't do it.
 -  We understand you.

880
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,120
We don't want your teeth pulled out because of this.

881
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:44,310
- It is okay, Yo Won.
 -  Thank you.

882
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,750
Good.

883
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,860
- That was funny.
 -  We succeeded.

884
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,410
(I'm Sorry, I Love You)

885
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,690
Wow, there is the panel.

886
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,910
- Look.
 -  Gosh.

887
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:57,140
- We are in this webtoon.
 -  Right.

888
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,900
I am a big fan of Jo Seok.

889
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,710
- We should apologise to him.
 -  We are sorry.

890
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,940
- Especially, Kwang Soo...
 -  Right, I am sorry.

891
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,210
- should have tried harder.
 -  Right.

892
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:10,140
- It's your fault, Kwang Soo.
 -  But you failed to make it fun.

893
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,010
- Right. It was my fault.
 -  Okay.

894
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,420
- Wow.
 -  He is here.

895
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,440
Hello.

896
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,770
- Hello.
 -  We're so sorry.

897
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,550
I am a big fan of yours.

898
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,440
(This 10-year-old webtoon has 1,000 episodes with 50 billion views.)

899
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,510
(The creator of "The Sound of Your Heart", Jo Seok)

900
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:32,740
(He appeared on our show as Kwang Soo visited him.)

901
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,240
(However)

902
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,070
(He appeared on the screen for about 5 minutes out of 95 minutes.)

903
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,990
- It was nice meeting you.
 -  Thank you.

904
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,410
(Soon after...)

905
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:44,480
(Hello, everyone. I am the webtoon master.)

906
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,710
(Okay, goodbye then)

907
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:51,340
(Is this Running Man? I love this show.)

908
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,740
(- You did great job today.
 -  Thank you. Bye.)

909
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:58,580
(He expressed his feelings through his webtoon.)

910
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:02,910
(You must be very disappointed.)

911
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,610
- I am your big fan.
 -  We are sorry.

912
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,810
- You look very cute.
 -  We are sorry.

913
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:13,170
You look happy today. But on that day, you had a grim look.

914
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,710
- We would like to apologise.
 -  It's okay.

915
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,140
We all read your webtoon.

916
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,210
I drew it because I thought I was never going to see you again.

917
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,480
(Running Man just started. Oh, there is our Seok!)

918
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,010
You were pretty disappointed, weren't you?

919
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,370
You even drew that episode. Right?

920
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:31,440
I was okay with that. But many around me kept asking me.

921
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,940
- "Were you really on the show?"
 -  I see.

922
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:38,980
So lied to them that they must've missed the scenes that I appeared.

923
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:43,760
- I see.
 -  I never expected to be here again.

924
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,490
"Jo Seok. Thank you for making time for us despite your schedule."

925
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,270
"We're sorry we let you down. You didn't appear on the show much..."

926
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,990
"when you were excited about the name tag ripping game."

927
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:55,170
"Again, we apologise for disappointing you."

928
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,140
- We're sorry.
 -  We're sorry.

929
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,010
- We have him here with us, today.
 -  Right.

930
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,770
When other programmes ask him to appear on their show,

931
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,570
- he doesn't easily go.
 -  He's hard to cast.

932
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,940
He doesn't appear on many programmes.

933
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,250
Jo Seok said he'd love to play the name tag ripping game.

934
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,490
(The name tag ripping game?)

935
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,640
- Let's make him win.
 -  Here?

936
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,510
I'll make him win.

937
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,640
(It's a uniform for Jo Seok.)

938
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,580
- You didn't have to do this.
 -  Let's do this.

939
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,650
Jo Seok is worried that things are getting out of hand.

940
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,810
It's not what he intended.

941
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,210
Who would you like to play against?

942
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,180
- I gave it some thought.
 -  Right.

943
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,610
- As it's a rare chance...
 -  Jong Kook?

944
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,910
I'd like to play against Jong Kook.

945
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,470
You should.

946
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,180
I wouldn't mind getting beaten up by him.

947
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:39,440
You don't have to feel embarrassed even if you lose to him.

948
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,840
- It's a good experience.
 -  Please keep in mind that...

949
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,140
I'm a huge fan of yours.

950
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,010
- Okay.
 -  I always read your cartoons.

951
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,720
- I love them.
 -  Start.

952
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,870
(A name tag ripping match between Jo Seok and Jong Kook)

953
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,990
I feel bad.

954
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,780
- I feel so bad for him.
 -  Hey.

955
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,510
- Why?
 -  What are you doing?

956
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,400
I'm a huge fan of his.

957
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,460
How will he walk around his neighbourhood?

958
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,640
His neighbours are watching.

959
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,440
You humiliated him in front of his neighbours.

960
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,270
Next. Start.

961
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:10,240
(Jo Seok versus Gary)

962
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,550
(Ripping)

963
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,340
What are you doing?

964
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:17,360
It's Kwang Soo versus Jo Seok. Get ready.

965
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,870
Start.

966
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,310
(Kwang Soo has many things to apologise for.)

967
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,440
Start.

968
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,750
(I will undo my wrongs.)

969
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,720
Go ahead.

970
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,490
(Ripping)

971
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,980
(Hey)

972
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,380
This is so cruel.

973
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,840
(Was this a good decision?)

974
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,610
- Why don't you play once more?
 -  You should.

975
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,080
Play once more.

976
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,270
Play against me.

977
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,270
- Why don't you play against Ji Hyo?
 -  Play against me.

978
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,110
- Beat me.
 -  Okay.

979
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,580
- Are you okay?
 -  I want to go home.

980
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,310
You should win before you go back.

981
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,470
I'll never draw such a cartoon.

982
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,170
- That's not why we're doing this.
 -  It's not.

983
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,570
- That's not why we came.
 -  It's not that.

984
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,980
We're not here for revenge.

985
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,710
- That's not it.
 -  We're here to apologise.

986
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,510
- You wanted to play the game.
 -  I want to apologise and go home.

987
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,470
- No way.
 -  You don't have to apologise.

988
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,310
- We should apologise.
 -  You can beat me.

989
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,540
He said, "I'll never draw such a cartoon."

990
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,170
It's more embarrassing if you go home.

991
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:12,500
- I'm sure you can beat me.
 -  Start.

992
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,720
Seok Jin is stronger than you expect.

993
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,280
I can see that.

994
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:17,910
(Struggling)

995
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:20,270
You have to win this time.

996
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,280
- He's strong.
 -  Let go of his hands.

997
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,950
(Seok Jin grabs the name tag.)

998
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,950
(His hand slips.)

999
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,780
- Let go of his hands.
 -  Come on.

1000
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,880
Be careful.

1001
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,870
(Seok Jin grabs Jo Seok's name tag.)

1002
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,990
(I'm winning unintentionally.)

1003
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,320
- His arms are too short.
 -  This is too harsh.

1004
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,010
He won!

1005
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,440
He's being too harsh.

1006
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,250
(Jo Seok ripped off Seok Jin's name tag.)

1007
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,640
- He won!
 -  He won!

1008
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,410
(Jo Seok won.)

1009
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,070
- He won!
 -  Let's toss him into the air.

1010
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,150
- In 3, 2, 1.
 -  In 3, 2, 1.

1011
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,520
(It's Jo Seok first win.)

1012
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,570
- In 3, 2, 1.
 -  He was strong.

1013
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,510
- He was so strong.
 -  You did a great job.

1014
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,140
He was strong.

1015
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,070
- You're the best.
 -  Seok Jin almost won.

1016
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,270
- Seok Jin was trying to win.
 -  He was.

1017
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,940
- Seok Jin lost. – He's really strong.

1018
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,910
Jo Seok is finally smiling.

1019
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,570
- You won!
 -  You did a great job.

1020
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,730
If you didn't win, you wouldn't have been able to sleep tonight.

1021
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:17,070
Jo Seok will draw us.

1022
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,570
- Really?
 -  That'll be amazing.

1023
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:21,610
- Give us your autograph, too.
 -  Your autograph.

1024
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,930
- Who is he drawing?
 -  I think it's Kwang Soo.

1025
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,320
It's obviously Kwang Soo.

1026
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,920
- It looks like Kwang Soo.
 -  It does.

1027
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:31,340
Do you draw the webtoons yourself?

1028
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,980
He does.

1029
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,350
He's so tall.

1030
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,840
- It's that body.
 -  I recognise this body.

1031
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,440
- It's the body from his webtoon.
 -  It's a rubber body.

1032
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,610
I'm not that tall.

1033
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,940
It's exactly like his webtoon.

1034
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,580
Are you angry at me?

1035
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,990
(Smiling)

1036
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,050
- That's amazing.
 -  Thank you.

1037
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,340
- Pose like the drawing.
 -  Okay.

1038
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,710
- Thank you.
 -  It does look like him.

1039
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,780
Who would you like to draw next?

1040
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,220
It's Gary.

1041
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,520
- It's Gary.
 -  Is it Jo Seok?

1042
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,170
Isn't it Jo Seok?

1043
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,910
- I think it's Jong Kook.
 -  No, it's Gary.

1044
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,270
- Is it Jong Kook?
 -  It's Gary.

1045
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,640
- It's Jong Kook.
 -  It's obviously you.

1046
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,140
- Look at the hair.
 -  It is Jong Kook.

1047
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,540
It's you. Look at the eyes.

1048
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,140
- It's me.
 -  The neck is the same.

1049
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,540
- It's the same.
 -  It's really me.

1050
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,800
- It looks exactly like you.
 -  It's definitely me.

1051
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,340
It's definitely Jong Kook.

1052
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,020
(A satisfied fan)

1053
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:23,170
(Jo Seok drew the other members, too.)

1054
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:27,160
- Jo Seok, we'd like to apologise.
 -  Right.

1055
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,470
We'll give you a golden name tag.

1056
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:30,270
It's a golden name tag.

1057
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:33,410
We'd like to give you a golden name tag.

1058
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,780
Thank you.

1059
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,460
Will you accept our apology?

1060
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,050
I wasn't sure if I should come today.

1061
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:44,910
Now, I think it was a good idea.

1062
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,500
- It was nice today, wasn't it?
 -  Yes, it was.

1063
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,410
I'll put this on my studio wall.

1064
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:53,370
- Thank you.
 -  We'll put this on our walls, too.

1065
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:57,160
- Since he accepted our apology,
 -  Right.

1066
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,140
- let's give him a big hand.
 -  Okay.

1067
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,170
- Thank you.
 -  Thank you.

1068
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:03,650
- Thank you.
 -  We'll look forward to your work.

1069
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,950
(We were sorry.)

1070
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:12,150
(They're on their way to meet the next person.)

1071
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:15,140
Don't you feel sorry to Kyuhyun as well?

1072
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,070
- I do.
 -  That episode in particular.

1073
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,010
I feel sorry to everyone in that episode,

1074
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,770
- including Yenny.
 -  Everyone.

1075
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:22,340
- I feel sorry to everyone.
 -  Rap Monster.

1076
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,010
- Rap Monster, too.
 -  And John Park.

1077
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,340
I feel so sorry to Kyuhyun.

1078
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,440
Does anyone have his phone number? Why don't we call him?

1079
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,620
- I have his number.
 -  Let's try it.

1080
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:37,310
(They're calling Kyuhyun.)

1081
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:38,620
- Hello?
 -  Kyuhyun.

1082
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,980
- Hello?
 -  Hi.

1083
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,470
- It's me.
 -  He sounds cold.

1084
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,710
- He's cold.
 -  Kyuhyun, I'm sorry.

1085
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:46,880
He must really be upset.

1086
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,650
It's the first time you've called me.

1087
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,840
(Jae Seok is embarrassed.)

1088
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,990
That's why I'm sorry. Where are you?

1089
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,910
I'm in Japan right now.

1090
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,270
Are you in Japan?

1091
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,710
- Japan?
 -  Yes.

1092
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,940
I've apologised to you...

1093
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,810
many times.

1094
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:07,340
- Have you really?
 -  Hey.

1095
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,140
- He must be really angry.
 -  I did.

1096
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,840
- Yes, I have.
 -  Apologise to him.

1097
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,110
I want to apologise. It's Gary.

1098
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:15,980
Gary...

1099
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,170
was the one who initiated it.

1100
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,910
- Gary is sorry.
 -  Right.

1101
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:24,510
So Gary, can you go to Fukuoka?

1102
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:25,940
- Me?
 -  You should go.

1103
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,280
Kyuhyun.

1104
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:29,610
- Yes.
 -  Then...

1105
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,240
- Gary, you should go.
 -  I'll...

1106
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,110
- You should go.
 -  meet you in Fukuoka...

1107
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,720
and apologise.

1108
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,810
(Really?)

1109
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:39,050
I finally arrived in Fukuoka.

1110
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,940
(Gary is in Japan.)

1111
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,720
I'm here to meet Kyuhyun.

1112
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,390
(Let's find Kyuhyun in Fukuoka.)

1113
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:50,940
So many of his fans are here.

1114
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,430
(Kyuhyun, please accept our apology.)

1115
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:55,970
- In 1, 2, 3.
 -  Go, Kyuhyun!

1116
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:57,570
- Go, Kyuhyun!
 -  Go, Kyuhyun!

1117
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:59,570
It's here. Kyuhyun!

1118
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,310
(Will Kyuhyun accept our apology?)

1119
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:04,250
(The global Apology Service is coming soon.)

1120
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,040
(Who's the fourth person to receive an apology?)

1121
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,470
- I hope Hee Jun will show up...
 -  Right.

1122
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,240
chubbier than before.

1123
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,410
- Wait.
 -  Really.

1124
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:16,040
It's all your fault.

1125
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,770
It was your personal mistake.

1126
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:20,640
- We don't have to apologise.
 -  You laughed, too.

1127
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,040
We laughed but he might have been hurt.

1128
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,310
I remember that day.

1129
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:30,070
We had to go into the water a lot.

1130
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:31,320
(Let's review what happened.)

1131
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,410
Get down, you fatty.

1132
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,340
You should give it to me.

1133
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,410
(Fatty)

1134
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,520
Fatty?

1135
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,520
My mum is watching this.

1136
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:48,240
No one could have called him fatty during his H.O.T. days.

1137
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,060
- Really.
 -  If it was back then,

1138
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,940
Jong Kook wouldn't be living in this country.

1139
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,610
His fans would cut out my eyes in my pictures.

1140
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:56,940
You'd be killed.

1141
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,340
He's coming.

1142
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,340
- He wouldn't be here.
 -  He's coming.

1143
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,650
(He's finally here.)

1144
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:07,820
(A chubby figure approaches.)

1145
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,920
(Moon Hee Jun)

1146
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:13,640
- He's here.
 -  Hello.

1147
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,810
You're even chubbier now.

1148
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:18,170
I won't sit down until Jong Kook leaves.

1149
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:19,570
Hee Jun, come here.

1150
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,340
- Hee Jun.
 -  Jong Kook should leave first.

1151
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,220
It's been a long time.

1152
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,070
Hee Jun.

1153
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,270
- We're sorry.
 -  Hee Jun.

1154
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,340
One of the members of H.O.T. is here.

1155
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,980
- Where have you been?
 -  Stop that.

1156
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,070
Has that incident...

1157
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,470
- caused you any trouble?
 -  Be honest.

1158
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:38,640
- Since that incident.
 -  Did you have a hard time?

1159
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,240
- Has it caused me trouble?
 -  Yes.

1160
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,570
(Did I have a hard time?)

1161
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:44,070
- When I search my name...
 -  Why?

1162
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:45,310
- What happens?
 -  What?

1163
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:47,570
Does the word "Fatty" show up when you search your name?

1164
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,970
"Moon Hee Jun Fatty", "Fatty Moon Hee Jun"...

1165
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:51,640
and "Fatty". All three of them show up.

1166
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,540
It drives me crazy.

1167
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,910
If it was only one, I could do something about it.

1168
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:57,570
But all the different word combinations show up.

1169
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:59,580
One in the Western way and one in the Korean way.

1170
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,610
"Moon Hee Jun Fatty", "Fatty Moon Hee Jun"...

1171
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:02,640
- and "Fatty".
 -  "Fatty".

1172
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,750
I searched for "Fatty" and all I find are pictures of you.

1173
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,650
- Read it.
 -  "To the legendary idol, Hee Jun."

1174
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:14,140
"We're sorry we upset you by calling you "Fatty" and "Yoyo"."

1175
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:18,810
"We're also sorry for upsetting your mother as well."

1176
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,220
We're sorry.

1177
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,240
You should apologise to his mother first.

1178
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,270
My mother was really hurt.

1179
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:26,340
- She was?
 -  Was she really?

1180
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,570
She has been texting me every day since then.

1181
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:29,740
- Does she tell you to lose weight?
 -  Yes.

1182
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,840
I'm sure she wanted to say that to you anyway.

1183
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,640
Jong Kook. I have never heard my mother...

1184
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,850
swear in my life.

1185
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:39,220
But she said, "Is that jerk out of his mind?"

1186
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,220
Really.

1187
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,310
Just because you have a fit body...

1188
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:45,770
- She was sad that I was hurt.
 -  I didn't mean it.

1189
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:49,910
It was just my cute way of calling you.

1190
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:52,340
- Why don't we give her a call?
 -  Are you calling my mother?

1191
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,940
- Jong Kook must apologise.
 -  Are they really calling my mum?

1192
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,750
(He'll apologise to Hee Jun's mother over the phone.)

1193
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,340
- Mum.
 -  Yes?

1194
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,480
It's me.

1195
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,380
So?

1196
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,770
She doesn't care.

1197
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:06,570
- Do you remember?
 -  She's not in a good mood.

1198
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:09,280
- What?
 -  When I was on Running Man,

1199
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,710
- Right.
 -  Jong Kook called me a fatty,

1200
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:15,310
- so you got mad, right?
 -  Of course!

1201
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:16,810
- Right?
 -  "Of course!"

1202
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:19,500
Running Man visited me...

1203
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,710
Did they call you a fatty again?

1204
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,830
No, they didn't call me a fatty.

1205
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:27,440
- They came over to apologise.
 -  Really?

1206
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,810
They all came.

1207
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:30,970
- Jong Kook is actually next to me.
 -  Let them talk.

1208
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:32,970
I'll give the phone to Jong Kook, okay?

1209
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:34,070
(He's flustered.)

1210
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:36,270
- Hello, Mrs Moon.
 -  Hey.

1211
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,320
Yes, Mrs Moon.

1212
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,270
- My granddaughter...
 -  Yes?

1213
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:43,100
keeps calling Hee Jun a fatty after she saw you say it.

1214
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,970
(Her uncle is a fatty.)

1215
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:50,120
She's my sister's daughter.

1216
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,140
- Is that what she said?
 -  She's your sister's daughter.

1217
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:56,370
I'll take charge and make Hee Jun exercise.

1218
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:57,740
- This is good.
 -  I'll keep my promise.

1219
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,870
- That sounds like a good idea.
 -  That's great.

1220
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:01,040
- I'm being serious.
 -  That's nice of you.

1221
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,480
- Sure.
 -  All right, Mrs Moon.

1222
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,110
(He apologised to both Hee Jun and his mother.)

1223
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:06,650
- Thank you, Mrs Moon.
 -  Take care!

1224
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,040
I'll take charge and give you some training tips.

1225
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,350
It turned out well in the end.

1226
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,270
- What's that?
 -  It's a gift.

1227
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:14,340
I didn't know there was a gift.

1228
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:15,760
- What's this?
 -  Are you going to mock him?

1229
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,310
- They look like pyjamas.
 -  Let's open this first.

1230
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:18,470
- This one first?
 -  Yes.

1231
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:19,710
(What's the first gift?)

1232
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:20,930
- What's that?
 -  What is it?

1233
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:22,770
- I have a bad feeling about this.
 -  It's a shirt.

1234
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:26,380
- It's a t-shirt with a design.
 -  There are muscles on it.

1235
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,120
- Why?
 -  What is it?

1236
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,070
I have muscles.

1237
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,340
(It's a t-shirt with a muscular body on it.)

1238
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:34,880
- Goodness.
 -  This is even sadder.

1239
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:37,870
I don't think it'll fit you.

1240
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:39,950
(He manages to put his head through.)

1241
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,580
- That's not how you do it.
 -  This is small.

1242
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,880
It fits.

1243
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:48,630
- It fits you.
 -  It does fit.

1244
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:51,270
It fits well on top of your shirt.

1245
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:53,180
Do you agree, Kwang Soo?

1246
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,240
- I can't even breathe.
 -  Well, I mean...

1247
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,020
- Does it have a hood?
 -  You need to take it out.

1248
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:00,370
Can you take a picture of it and post it up on SNS?

1249
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,640
- Post it up for him.
 -  Sure, I will.

1250
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,150
Can someone take a picture for us?

1251
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,980
In 1, 2, 3.

1252
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,850
(Hee Jun is not a fatty.)

1253
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,650
- We're sorry.
 -  All right, Hee Jun.

1254
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,400
- Please accept our apology.
 -  Okay.

1255
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,420
Thanks so much.

1256
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,220
- Hee Jun.
 -  Take an apple...

1257
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,340
You must take a bite of an apple to accept our apology.

1258
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,570
- Is that so?
 -  Yes.

1259
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:22,920
I'm rooting for you, Hee Jun.

1260
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,920
(Taking a bite)

1261
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:28,110
It's delicious.

1262
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:29,520
He accepted the apology.

1263
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,640
I'm seriously rooting for you.

1264
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,650
(Hee Jun accepts their apology.)

1265
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:35,480
(I'm Sorry, I Love You)

1266
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,370
(They're going to meet the last guest.)

1267
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:38,520
Who are we apologising to?

1268
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,310
- I'm not sure.
 -  Who could it be?

1269
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:43,150
(Who could be the last guest?)

1270
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:46,380
Who could it be?

1271
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,420
Thank you for the ride.

1272
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,310
(They have reached the end of a long day.)

1273
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:54,920
You have all worked hard to serve the guests.

1274
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,170
The last Apology Service is the most important one.

1275
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,220
It's time...

1276
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:01,820
for an Apology Service amongst the members.

1277
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,820
(It's an Apology Service amongst Running Man members.)

1278
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,440
No way.

1279
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,240
I'm cringing already.

1280
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,080
This is quite awkward.

1281
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,840
In case you don't know what to say, write it down first.

1282
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,110
Can't we just talk amongst ourselves?

1283
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:16,480
- What are we doing?
 -  We'll talk amongst ourselves.

1284
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,510
(They can't help but laugh.)

1285
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:20,650
What am I sorry about?

1286
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:22,720
I've never thought about this.

1287
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:24,920
Do I just write anything?

1288
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:29,080
(It's the first time they're writing to each other in six years.)

1289
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:31,540
(They meet every week.)

1290
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:32,610
I finished.

1291
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:33,910
(Would they have anything to say?)

1292
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:35,520
- Are you done?
 -  Yes.

1293
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:42,720
(They slowly fill the pages with their words.)

1294
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,810
I don't know what to write.

1295
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:51,650
(Among them, Jae Seok has a difficult time writing.)

1296
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:59,630
(He doesn't know how to condense his feelings onto a single page...)

1297
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:04,480
(for the 6 members who spent the past 6 years with him.)

1298
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:11,080
(Gathering courage, he picks up the pen and begins to write.)

1299
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:19,910
Jae Seok, you can go into the white room.

1300
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:20,920
- Me?
 -  Yes.

1301
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:23,810
Kwang Soo, you can head to the recreational vehicle.

1302
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:26,840
(Kwang Soo will share a conversation with someone there.)

1303
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:27,980
- Seok Jin.
 -  Yes.

1304
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,370
- Go to the food stand.
 -  The food stand?

1305
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:31,710
Okay. I don't even drink.

1306
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:33,380
(Seok Jin heads to the food stand.)

1307
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,550
(These spaces are perfect for two people.)

1308
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,610
(Jae Seok enters a white room.)

1309
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:43,050
(Who will join him?)

1310
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,480
(I knew it was going to be you.)

1311
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:51,080
- I knew it was going to be you.
 -  What is this?

1312
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,650
- Why...
 -  Gosh.

1313
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,210
- What is this, anyway?
 -  I don't know.

1314
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:58,470
- Why do we have to do this?
 -  I have no idea.

1315
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:00,270
(This is so awkward.)

1316
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:02,010
- Goodness.
 -  What? Why?

1317
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:03,810
- Did you write to me?
 -  No.

1318
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:05,380
- Me neither.
 -  Gosh.

1319
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,300
- Seriously.
 -  Goodness.

1320
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,350
So...

1321
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:11,720
- I don't know what this is about.
 -  Well...

1322
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:16,040
Why do we have to face each other? It's awkward.

1323
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,470
Exactly. Oh, dear.

1324
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:20,830
I never thought it was awkward between us before.

1325
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:22,540
- This makes us awkward.
 -  It does.

1326
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,040
What's this about?

1327
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,650
- It's awkward like this.
 -  Exactly.

1328
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:30,240
I don't know what we are supposed to talk about.

1329
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,910
I didn't write anything special.

1330
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:37,630
I just wrote this. It must be the same for the rest of us,

1331
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:40,750
but since we have different roles on this show,

1332
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,720
sometimes...

1333
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:46,970
I end up acting aggressively.

1334
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:48,510
- But I had to because...
 -  Of course.

1335
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:50,110
- everybody is so nice.
 -  Right. We know...

1336
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:53,710
that you have to take on a certain role in playing the villain.

1337
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:55,050
Exactly. So even when I talk,

1338
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,420
I speak aggressively.

1339
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,150
- I get it.
 -  Gosh.

1340
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:03,770
Sometimes, I know I've gone too far but I still say those words.

1341
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:05,880
- Right.
 -  I say them on purpose.

1342
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,770
This is part of the show.

1343
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:10,210
- Of course.
 -  Since it's part of the show,

1344
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:13,110
- I think that you'll understand me.
 -  Certainly.

1345
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:15,150
But still, I sometimes...

1346
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:20,850
think you and Seok Jin might be offended by what I do.

1347
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:25,160
But for our show, we have to get physical so it can turn violent.

1348
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,550
That's understandable.

1349
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,880
I mentioned this before,

1350
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:31,620
but athletes reach their prime as well.

1351
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:33,550
- You know what I mean, right?
 -  I know.

1352
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,750
Since my body is starting to ache,

1353
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:41,250
there are more things I can't do on Running Man.

1354
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,250
That's when I was in a slump.

1355
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,080
It was because...

1356
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,900
I knew people had expectations for me.

1357
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,250
But my body wouldn't heal.

1358
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,980
So I couldn't fulfil my role in those moments.

1359
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,220
I was put down every time that happened.

1360
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:02,210
There were times when I questioned...

1361
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:04,650
- my place on this show.
 -  Right.

1362
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:07,110
But I knew that if I gave this up,

1363
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:10,950
I wouldn't be invited to appear on other programmes.

1364
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:14,720
So there was a time when I struggled with the thought.

1365
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,210
(Jong Kook expresses his anxiety for the first time.)

1366
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:18,480
- I know.
 -  Because of that, when I spoke,

1367
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:22,650
I was being aggressive to cover up my flaws.

1368
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:24,620
- I see.
 -  That's what I turned to.

1369
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:31,620
But I think that could have been too much for the members and guests.

1370
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,050
(Jae Seok quietly listens to Jong Kook.)

1371
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:40,540
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo is waiting inside the van.)

1372
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:43,110
(Someone is here.)

1373
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:45,050
(Laughing)

1374
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,770
(He bursts into laughter...)

1375
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:52,240
(as soon as he sees Ji Hyo.)

1376
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,470
This is insane.

1377
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:55,840
This is so awkward, Kwang Soo.

1378
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,020
(This is so awkward, Kwang Soo.)

1379
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,270
Oh goodness.

1380
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:00,740
(His face has turned red in embarrassment.)

1381
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:02,380
What is this for?

1382
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:05,350
Why are you making us do this?

1383
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,820
What are we supposed to do here?

1384
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:10,840
(He can't breathe.)

1385
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,310
What are we supposed to do?

1386
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:14,180
This atmosphere is...

1387
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,870
What is this?

1388
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:18,050
(Wailing)

1389
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:21,710
- I can't believe this.
 -  I can't look at you in the eyes.

1390
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:22,770
I know.

1391
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:25,740
What are we doing? What is this supposed to be?

1392
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,270
What do you want us to do?

1393
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:29,570
(They're suffocating in the silence.)

1394
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:31,650
I'll just tell you what I wrote, then.

1395
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,460
Did you write to me?

1396
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,720
I did.

1397
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,950
- I wrote what I was grateful about.
 -  What is it?

1398
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,140
I'm truly grateful to you...

1399
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,270
(I'm truly grateful to you...)

1400
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:43,320
(Sighing)

1401
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:45,910
I thought...

1402
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:47,220
(He's laughing already.)

1403
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:50,580
It actually occurred to me many times.

1404
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:56,110
I always questioned whether this was really my place to be.

1405
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:57,410
(Is this my place to be?)

1406
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:59,020
I was absorbed in it.

1407
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:02,250
It's been six years now.

1408
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:08,310
But in the beginning, I couldn't mingle with the other members.

1409
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:10,820
(She couldn't open up to the members.)

1410
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:13,040
I felt bad during that time.

1411
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,270
(I felt sorry at the time.)

1412
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:15,770
I cried a lot...

1413
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:18,170
(I cried a lot.)

1414
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:20,770
And I had a hard time, so I told you that I wanted to quit.

1415
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:22,740
(I cried a lot and I wanted to quit.)

1416
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:23,850
- You told me.
 -  I did.

1417
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,040
Whenever I said that...

1418
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,770
(Whenever I said that...)

1419
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:32,780
You held on to me.

1420
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:34,840
I'm so thankful...

1421
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,970
(I'm thankful.)

1422
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:38,110
You listened to me.

1423
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:40,330
(I'm so thankful that you listened to me.)

1424
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:43,510
- That's what I wrote.
 -  You're thankful I listened to you.

1425
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:44,640
I'm thankful about that...

1426
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,710
(Kwang Soo quietly listens to Ji Hyo.)

1427
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:48,480
And I'm also thankful that you continued to treat me the same.

1428
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,270
That's just...

1429
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:51,640
(I'm thankful that you treated me the same.)

1430
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,780
How I felt.

1431
00:56:54,280 --> 00:57:01,700
(He is an actor as well, so he could understand her deeply.)

1432
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:03,180
I did.

1433
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:07,890
I guess they have a lot to talk to each other.

1434
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,370
(She tries to change the subject.)

1435
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:10,640
I got something in my eyes.

1436
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,310
- What are you doing?
 -  What am I doing?

1437
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:16,980
- What are you doing, suddenly?
 -  I got something in my eyes.

1438
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:22,570
What am I doing here?

1439
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:24,620
We should be ripping off name tags.

1440
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:29,780
I wrote what I feel sorry about.

1441
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:33,540
What makes you feel sorry?

1442
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:34,880
I...

1443
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:42,220
I think I act rudely towards you too often.

1444
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:47,850
We've spent several years together. I know the things that you dislike,

1445
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,350
and I know that I may hurt your feeling if I act in certain ways.

1446
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:57,820
But I don't how I must act for the best result.

1447
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:04,450
I want to do well so I do my best, and try hard. But in the end,

1448
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,710
I'm not just saying...

1449
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:10,610
(I might have hurt Ji Hyo.)

1450
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:12,650
I am so sorry. But if I say sorry,

1451
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:17,850
then I shouldn't act like that again. It's really difficult.

1452
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:20,320
I know.

1453
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:27,070
Don't worry. I'm fine. Actually, I can't remember.

1454
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:28,710
What a relief. Because I may keep doing what I was doing.

1455
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:30,520
Yes, keep behaving like that.

1456
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:36,080
I think that's better for us. More than talking like this.

1457
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,820
More than talking like this.

1458
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,740
- Oh my.
 -  This is crazy.

1459
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:44,780
They must have a lot to talk about.

1460
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:47,340
(How are Jae Seok and Jong Kook in the white room doing?)

1461
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:51,840
I'm really grateful to you for thinking about me like that.

1462
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:57,920
To be honest, in the team,

1463
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:00,970
- I usually stand as an opponent.
 -  Right.

1464
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,110
That's not an easy job for me.

1465
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:06,210
- Because you're doing it alone.
 -  Yes. And at the same time,

1466
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:13,210
I have to stand against you, out of all the others. It's not easy.

1467
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:16,370
- I see.
 -  And things were like that before.

1468
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:20,510
I did something to you, and it became really controversial.

1469
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:24,370
I try to forget the burden. I don't have any options.

1470
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:27,780
- Because it's my job.
 -  It is.

1471
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:32,740
So I try not to think about that these days.

1472
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:35,570
I used to say that...

1473
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:38,080
I can't do anything if people blame me.

1474
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,770
- Because it's my role.
 -  You're right.

1475
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:43,580
- As long as we're fine about it.
 -  Right.

1476
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:49,140
Anyway, because it's my job, I keep on acting that way. As I did before.

1477
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:53,440
- So no matter how much...
 -  You must act like that to anyone.

1478
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:58,340
That will put us in different situations each time.

1479
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:01,370
Every member in Running Man is really important.

1480
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:07,710
And everyone has to do their best in their role for Running Man.

1481
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:14,880
I must take care of the things that I didn't know until you told me.

1482
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:18,460
- Jong Kook.
 -  You just keep yourself healthy.

1483
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:21,710
- You need to keep your health, too.
 -  Of course. Both of us need to.

1484
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:26,640
I've worked in other entertainment shows, but I think...

1485
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,240
we've spent many years together, and we have the best teamwork.

1486
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,640
Right, of course.

1487
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:35,580
So if we keep ourselves in good shape,

1488
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:38,380
- we will be able to keep rolling.
 -  Let's do it.

1489
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:40,080
That's it.

1490
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,390
- That's right.
 -  Okay. We're done.

1491
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:44,640
(They feel embarrassed after all the talk.)

1492
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,070
- Okay. We're all set.
 -  Okay.

1493
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:49,310
- Okay. Keep treating me like that.
 -  I will.

1494
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:52,330
- Keep it on.
 -  What is it?

1495
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:56,340
- Okay. Let's go.
 -  Let's go.

1496
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:57,580
Let's go, Jae Seok.

1497
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,320
All right. We're done.

1498
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:03,650
(Who's visiting Seok Jin's food stand?)

1499
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:09,080
(Haha is the one.)

1500
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:13,610
- Oh my.
 -  My goodness.

1501
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:15,800
Okay. Take a seat.

1502
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,580
- Nice to see you here, Seok Jin.
 -  Yes. Help yourself.

1503
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:23,820
- Isn't it the first time?
 -  For us to sit by ourselves.

1504
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,810
- Cheers.
 -  Cheers.

1505
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:30,220
(It's first time for them to drink together just by themselves.)

1506
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:33,080
Have I upset you in any way?

1507
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:35,440
You haven't upset me.

1508
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,850
(How should I put this?)

1509
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:43,770
- I should apologise.
 -  What are you talking about?

1510
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:47,640
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

1511
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,250
Oh my.

1512
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:52,480
For the first few years,

1513
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:58,020
I kept asking myself...

1514
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:02,750
why I am doing this every week.

1515
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:06,750
- But I didn't feel like to quit.
 -  I see.

1516
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:12,320
Because the style of the show was far too different from others.

1517
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:18,470
I used to say that it took several years to get used to snap backs.

1518
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:22,320
Just like that, it took several years to get used to the show.

1519
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:27,110
I didn't think I fit in well in the team.

1520
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,460
- Did you think that way?
 -  I did.

1521
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:36,250
I talked to the producer several times about quitting.

1522
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:41,210
Haha. The thing that I want to tell you is that...

1523
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:45,510
everyone can be like that. Some may not fit in the show.

1524
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:47,620
But my fault is...

1525
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:53,820
that I blamed you guys for it at that time.

1526
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:57,980
Whatever you said, I was easily offended.

1527
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:02,610
I just realised that with such act and attitude,

1528
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:07,220
I couldn't be a comfortable friend or a colleague to you.

1529
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:10,540
It took a long time for me to realise.

1530
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:14,590
Then I asked myself, "What should I do?"

1531
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:17,950
So I started accepting everything.

1532
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:19,700
(I accepted everything.)

1533
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:22,950
I realised that I shouldn't feel offended.

1534
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:29,470
So one day, I started off a race, smiling...

1535
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:34,080
- We all applauded.
 -  That made me feel comfortable.

1536
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:39,250
- About that...
 -  I am sorry. I am.

1537
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,710
(Who will be the second guest for Jae Seok?)

1538
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:46,180
- Hey, Gary.
 -  Yes, Jae Seok.

1539
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,950
Do we need to keep the side open?

1540
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:54,170
- Hey, Gary. Why are you here?
 -  I was asked to come in.

1541
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:55,770
- Really?
 -  Yes.

1542
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:58,650
- I am here, so let me tell you...
 -  All right.

1543
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:02,950
- My concern is...
 -  Okay.

1544
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:08,110
My concern as an entertainer is growing bigger these days.

1545
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:09,910
Jong Kook talked with me about that, too.

1546
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:11,950
Okay. So...

1547
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:17,770
Personally, I kept thinking that this might be the end.

1548
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,720
Then I shake my head and cheer myself again.

1549
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:26,760
But I am afraid that I might lose everything.

1550
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,280
When I try to work on music seriously,

1551
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:32,580
I often feel that I'm not serious about music.

1552
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:38,220
I can't concentrate when I didn't make any progress in composing.

1553
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:44,160
So such things concerned me heavily.

1554
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,480
(Those things concerned me.)

1555
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,920
What burdens me is the question,

1556
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:53,820
"So, what should I do now?"

1557
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:59,780
Honestly, I thought I had to quit. It was the best for this show.

1558
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:05,140
I thought I had to quit...

1559
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:08,520
for Running Man. Honestly.

1560
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:14,980
I think everyone including myself will have such concerns.

1561
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,370
We are trying to change ourselves.

1562
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:21,940
You know, we all used to play in a playground when we were young.

1563
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:25,570
But as we get older,

1564
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:30,150
we can't play in the same place forever.

1565
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:33,910
We won't have much fun playing with the same rides over and over.

1566
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:40,230
To find different sides of us, we shouldn't do the same things.

1567
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:43,350
For that, staff members are working hard.

1568
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:47,270
We don't have any other way but to do our best.

1569
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:51,140
- I am thinking hard...
 -  Of course.

1570
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:54,410
- about what I can do for this show.
 -  Of course, I know.

1571
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:56,740
Staff members are working hard, too.

1572
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:58,640
That's what we must do for Running Man.

1573
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:03,640
Staff members are looking for new environments that we can play in.

1574
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:07,310
That's their concern, and that's what we must do for the show.

1575
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:09,590
- I will do my best.
 -  Of course.

1576
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:12,310
- Hey, Gary.
 -  All right.

1577
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:14,240
(Cheer up, Gary.)

1578
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:17,740
- Let's go.
 -  All right. That's so simple.

1579
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:21,050
- It is simple.
 -  It's not difficult at all.

1580
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:24,380
Oh. come in.

1581
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:26,510
Take a sit.

1582
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:28,420
We were having a sincere conversation.

1583
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:33,740
I am in the middle. Especially, regarding age.

1584
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:34,930
Yes, you are.

1585
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:38,340
And Kwang Soo had some difficult times, too.

1586
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:40,740
- So we talked to each other often.
 -  Did you?

1587
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:43,630
- He found things difficult, too.
 -  I talked about it with Haha a lot.

1588
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:46,920
So we cheered up each other and one day,

1589
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:51,250
Kwang Soo began showing his presence and the show went well.

1590
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:52,960
I know this is awkward.

1591
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,540
But I want to say I'm really thankful to you, Kwang Soo.

1592
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:59,650
And you helped me a lot when I had to be funny.

1593
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:03,330
Seeing you working really hard, I was also motivated a lot.

1594
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:06,270
Kwang Soo is an actor. So I'm sure it was not easy...

1595
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:08,250
for him to give up on his image as an actor.

1596
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:12,640
So I think you should rather be an entertainer than an actor.

1597
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,620
(Do not waste your talent as an entertainer.)

1598
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:17,270
You're just too funny to remain as an actor.

1599
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:19,110
Don't try to look handsome.

1600
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:21,440
That is not what I want.

1601
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,920
- I never tried to look nice.
 -  Okay.

1602
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,450
It's really nice to have this conversation with you.

1603
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:31,470
(Who is it for the last Apology Service?)

1604
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:32,880
Hello, you're here.

1605
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:35,380
It took very long.

1606
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:37,510
I know, we had a lot to talk about.

1607
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:41,240
Seok Jin told me his story.

1608
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,400
He told me what happened in his life before.

1609
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,380
(Silent)

1610
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:49,110
I was going to...

1611
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:51,500
Gosh, what is this?

1612
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,750
What I want to apologise to you is...

1613
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:59,550
Oh, my. This isn't what I expected.

1614
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,840
I am sorry that I said you're very ugly.

1615
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:05,650
- But I know I am ugly too.
 -  Well...

1616
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:09,060
- What you said is true.
 -  So...

1617
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:11,200
That is what I thought.

1618
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,530
It is true that I am ugly.

1619
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:14,170
(They burst into laughter.)

1620
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:16,640
Haha and I aren't like this!

1621
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,640
My goodness!

1622
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,640
(What is going on between the ugly brothers?)

1623
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,320
Anyway, as we got this chance to talk, I want to tell you this.

1624
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:29,210
You know I've never appeared on such entertaining shows before.

1625
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:30,520
And I think...

1626
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,030
you're my role model as an entertainer.

1627
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:34,650
(You're my role model.)

1628
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:38,240
(This is so awkward!)

1629
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,480
Okay, I did it!

1630
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,510
I said it.

1631
01:08:42,510 --> 01:08:45,040
So just know that I am grateful to you.

1632
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,320
Okay, I know.

1633
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:51,170
And you are the best in my life.

1634
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:53,710
- I love you.
 -  You're my role model.

1635
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:56,880
Oh, my. You know what?

1636
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:59,980
I am your fan.

1637
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:04,420
(Their conversation is full of lines that make you cringe.)

1638
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:08,410
Gosh, what is this?

1639
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:10,250
(The Apology Service between the members are over.)

1640
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:14,850
- Cover your body with this.
 -  No, thanks, my role model.

1641
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,410
- Haha, do you need anything?
 -  I am okay.

1642
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:20,410
- Then, give that to me.
 -  He is my role model.

1643
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:21,420
(I'm fine. You can use it.)

1644
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:23,850
Haha is my role model.

1645
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:26,280
(They now have strong friendship.)

1646
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,710
You're my idol.

1647
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:29,310
- Can we wrap this up now?
 -  Yes.

1648
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:31,070
- So we don't read the letters?
 -  Please...

1649
01:09:31,070 --> 01:09:32,340
burn the letters.

1650
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:34,040
- Let's burn them.
 -  Okay.

1651
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:35,610
- Great, let's burn them.
 -  Please.

1652
01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:37,410
- Please burn them.
 -  I think I was out of my mind.

1653
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:40,290
- I don't want the letters.
 -  I must have been out of my mind.

1654
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,150
(Let's burn the grudges off along with the letters.)

1655
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:44,440
- Then, let's burn them.
 -  Okay.

1656
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,410
- Let's count to three.
 -  One, two, three.

1657
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:47,640
- Let's burn them off.
 -  Goodbye.

1658
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,900
- Goodbye.
 -  Bye.

1659
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:52,720
- Let's not feel sorry any more.
 -  I must have gone out of my mind.

1660
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:56,870
- And more than 300 guests...
 -  Right.

1661
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:58,940
appeared on our show.

1662
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:01,210
- Our guests.
 -  Yes, our guests.

1663
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:04,540
We were able to meet only a few of them...

1664
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:05,910
- in this special.
 -  Yes.

1665
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,970
And please join us as our guests...

1666
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:10,810
if you're willing to.

1667
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:13,870
We'd like to take this opportunity to say thank you to all the guests.

1668
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:17,540
And we promise you here that we'll cooperate and...

1669
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:20,050
work harder to make our guests enjoy the shooting...

1670
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:23,970
and to make the programme much more enjoyable.

1671
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:27,010
We will see you next week.

1672
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:28,470
Shall we hold each other's hand?

1673
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:30,410
- No.
 -  What are you doing?

1674
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:31,740
- Gosh.
 -  No way.

1675
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:33,440
- Let's hold each other's hand.
 -  Thank you, everyone!

1676
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,040
- Hold hands.
 -  My hands are in sweat.

1677
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,570
- Let's hold each other's hand now.
 -  Gosh!

1678
01:10:36,570 --> 01:10:39,470
- My goodness.
 -  Are you living in the 90s?

1679
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:41,940
- It is very heart-warming.
 -  Why do we have to do this?

1680
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:44,510
- It is heart-warming.
 -  Thank you, everyone!

1681
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:46,110
- Thank you!
 -  Thank you!

1682
01:10:46,110 --> 01:10:48,140
- I am sorry, I love you!
 -  I am sorry!

1683
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:50,210
- Thank you.
 -  Great.

1684
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:52,830
- It feels good, doesn't it?
 -  Right.

1685
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:54,110
This makes me feel good.

1686
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:56,150
- Ji Hyo.
 -  Jae Seok.

1687
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:58,870
(Next Sunday at 6:25pm)

1688
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:00,440
(The second episode of "I'm Sorry, I Love You", "Seven Loves")

1689
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:01,780
(Jae Seok's high school classmate, Lee Seung Joon)

1690
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:03,370
He's Lee Seung Joon, my high school classmate.

1691
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:05,410
Jae Seok had a long-term girlfriend.

1692
01:11:05,410 --> 01:11:07,040
She was tall but not pretty.

1693
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,310
You can't do this.

1694
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:09,740
Seung Joon reveals everything about Jae Seok today.

1695
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:11,110
He is my role model.

1696
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:12,940
(Haha's idol, Lee Moon Se)

1697
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:16,310
I started dreaming to be a singer after listening to his songs.

1698
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:18,470
Is that your best?

1699
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:20,640
- Ma'am!
 -  Jong Kook's mother.

1700
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,810
- He is like a daughter.
 -  Daughter?

1701
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:25,440
- He acts like a daughter at home.
 -  He is a cute boy to his mother.

1702
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,780
See? He's like a daughter.

1703
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:28,170
(Isn't he?)

1704
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:29,250
- Hello.
 -  Hello.

1705
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,570
Hurry up.

1706
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:32,720
(A fierce race to find the seven loves.)

1707
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:36,950
- Hello?
 -  Hello?

1708
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:38,720
How have you been?

1709
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:42,190
She is my first girlfriend.

1710
01:11:42,190 --> 01:11:44,640
It feels weird.

1711
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,840
(Kwang Soo meets his first girlfriend in 20 years.)

1712
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,620
I don't know why I was like that...

1713
01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:53,020
("Seven Loves" will be aired at 6:25pm next Sunday.)
