1
00:00:04,944 --> 00:00:06,144
Hey, guys.

2
00:00:06,414 --> 00:00:08,344
In six hours, you shall meet me...

3
00:00:09,114 --> 00:00:10,784
and receive a deadly punishment.

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,484
(It's time for the deadly punishment.)

5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:16,484
(The sun has set, and it's time to receive the penalty.)

6
00:00:18,314 --> 00:00:20,814
("You won't be in your right mind.")

7
00:00:20,884 --> 00:00:23,244
("All you will want to do is escape.")

8
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:26,184
(It's famous in Incheon for its frightening angle.)

9
00:00:26,244 --> 00:00:28,914
(It's the roughest pirate ship in the world.)

10
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:34,254
(It's a pirate ship on Wolmido Island.)

11
00:00:35,254 --> 00:00:37,214
(And...)

12
00:00:37,284 --> 00:00:39,484
(a man waits for them.)

13
00:00:39,544 --> 00:00:43,914
(Who is he, sitting in front of a pirate ship?)

14
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:47,684
(David McInnis)

15
00:00:49,944 --> 00:00:51,044
Hello.

16
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:53,444
(It's David, the man who warned them about their upcoming penalty.)

17
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:54,614
It's David McInnis.

18
00:00:54,684 --> 00:00:56,614
(Should we greet him or fear him?)

19
00:00:56,684 --> 00:00:57,714
Hey.

20
00:00:58,544 --> 00:01:00,414
(They greet each other with swag.)

21
00:01:00,484 --> 00:01:01,514
Oh my goodness.

22
00:01:01,584 --> 00:01:02,784
Why is David here?

23
00:01:02,844 --> 00:01:03,844
(Why is David here?)

24
00:01:04,284 --> 00:01:05,644
This is your last chance.

25
00:01:05,744 --> 00:01:08,784
David will ask each of you a question.

26
00:01:08,954 --> 00:01:12,044
You must reply with either a "Yes" or a "No".

27
00:01:12,184 --> 00:01:13,744
Your answer will determine...

28
00:01:13,884 --> 00:01:16,514
whether or not you will ride the pirate ship.

29
00:01:18,684 --> 00:01:19,944
- It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

30
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:22,584
- I'm your fan. - You're my fan? I'm your fan.

31
00:01:22,744 --> 00:01:24,384
- Thank you, Bro. - Thank you.

32
00:01:24,644 --> 00:01:26,384
You should call me "Big Brother".

33
00:01:26,914 --> 00:01:28,284
- Big Bro. - Good.

34
00:01:28,344 --> 00:01:29,584
(David begins to ask the final questions.)

35
00:01:29,644 --> 00:01:31,144
Okay, I'm going to give you one question.

36
00:01:31,214 --> 00:01:32,214
Yes.

37
00:01:32,684 --> 00:01:34,444
You're going to have three seconds to answer that.

38
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:36,044
- Got it, three seconds. - Okay.

39
00:01:36,244 --> 00:01:37,684
You might not like this question,

40
00:01:37,984 --> 00:01:40,114
but if you're a thrill seeker, you might like it.

41
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,314
But if not,

42
00:01:42,684 --> 00:01:43,714
you won't.

43
00:01:44,144 --> 00:01:47,144
So, are you ready to face your punishment?

44
00:01:47,214 --> 00:01:48,314
You don't like?

45
00:01:49,414 --> 00:01:51,584
Yes or no?

46
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:52,944
Yes or no?

47
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:54,744
- Three. Two. - Is that his question?

48
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,644
(Seok Jin has no idea what the question was.)

49
00:01:56,714 --> 00:01:58,244
(What is his decision?)

50
00:01:58,314 --> 00:01:59,984
- No. - I think that's wrong.

51
00:02:00,614 --> 00:02:02,784
- That's tough. - He just answered.

52
00:02:03,114 --> 00:02:05,014
- All right. Seok Jin. - Yes.

53
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:06,414
(Seok Jin said no.)

54
00:02:06,484 --> 00:02:11,184
(Will he be able to avoid the penalty?)

55
00:02:11,544 --> 00:02:13,444
(He's...)

56
00:02:13,514 --> 00:02:14,514
(safe.)

57
00:02:14,584 --> 00:02:15,644
Yes.

58
00:02:15,914 --> 00:02:17,284
(Seok Jin will not ride the pirate ship.)

59
00:02:17,444 --> 00:02:19,814
- Yes! - Does he not have to ride it?

60
00:02:19,884 --> 00:02:20,984
- He avoided the penalty. - Thank you.

61
00:02:21,244 --> 00:02:23,414
- Did he get it right? - Did you choose...

62
00:02:23,484 --> 00:02:25,384
- between yes and no? - I just guessed.

63
00:02:25,444 --> 00:02:26,854
I might be the only one riding the ship.

64
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:28,314
- I just guessed. - No way.

65
00:02:29,244 --> 00:02:31,214
You don't want to say you will ride a pirate ship,

66
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,084
but you can't say you won't...

67
00:02:33,244 --> 00:02:36,414
because you don't have a choice.

68
00:02:37,914 --> 00:02:39,414
So you're going to be honest with me.

69
00:02:39,584 --> 00:02:42,844
He said a long sentence, but the only word I understood was "choice".

70
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:44,314
Would you rather die...

71
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:46,244
or live...

72
00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:48,614
and ride a pirate ship?

73
00:02:49,184 --> 00:02:50,914
- Live, live. - Live, live.

74
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:55,744
Okay. So now, it's your choice. Yes or no?

75
00:02:55,984 --> 00:02:57,044
Oh, my.

76
00:02:57,114 --> 00:02:58,144
(I have a master's degree.)

77
00:02:58,214 --> 00:03:00,314
Do you choose not to ride the pirate ship?

78
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,114
I'm going mad.

79
00:03:03,514 --> 00:03:04,614
Please.

80
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:06,444
(What will Haha say?)

81
00:03:06,514 --> 00:03:08,914
Yes.

82
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:11,614
Do you want to ride the ship or not?

83
00:03:11,784 --> 00:03:12,814
Haha.

84
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,484
(Will Haha be able to avoid the penalty?)

85
00:03:15,844 --> 00:03:19,984
(I really don't want to ride the pirate ship.)

86
00:03:20,044 --> 00:03:21,484
- You'll ride the ship. - Oh, no!

87
00:03:21,544 --> 00:03:22,614
(Haha will ride the pirate ship.)

88
00:03:22,684 --> 00:03:26,744
(Oh my goodness.)

89
00:03:27,214 --> 00:03:28,214
Really?

90
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:29,484
(That's too bad.)

91
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:32,214
- Haha couldn't avoid the penalty. - He has to ride the ship.

92
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:34,814
Now, regardless of your will,

93
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:37,044
you will eventually choose to ride the pirate ship.

94
00:03:37,114 --> 00:03:38,114
No.

95
00:03:38,244 --> 00:03:40,114
You may eventually have to ride the pirate ship.

96
00:03:40,184 --> 00:03:41,484
What do you say? Yes or no?

97
00:03:41,814 --> 00:03:43,344
(Ji Won's answer is no.)

98
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:44,444
No.

99
00:03:45,114 --> 00:03:46,284
What's the result?

100
00:03:46,614 --> 00:03:47,614
(She avoids the penalty.)

101
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,714
Yes.

102
00:03:48,784 --> 00:03:50,044
(It's a series of successes.)

103
00:03:50,114 --> 00:03:51,184
(All three of them avoid the penalty.)

104
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:52,614
They got lucky.

105
00:03:53,914 --> 00:03:54,944
Is that it?

106
00:03:56,344 --> 00:03:57,444
Yes.

107
00:03:57,714 --> 00:04:00,614
- Kwang Soo will ride the ship. - I knew he would.

108
00:04:00,714 --> 00:04:01,814
That was great.

109
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:03,414
(That was perfect.)

110
00:04:03,814 --> 00:04:05,084
(You'll be riding the pirate ship.)

111
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,414
- Why? - What are you doing?

112
00:04:07,644 --> 00:04:08,884
- Why? - Put your hat back on.

113
00:04:10,844 --> 00:04:12,514
(Three people have to ride the pirate ship.)

114
00:04:12,614 --> 00:04:14,584
Put your seatbelts on and hold on tight.

115
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:17,084
I really hate this. Gosh.

116
00:04:17,814 --> 00:04:20,384
- Can you move over a bit? - Can you lower the safety bar?

117
00:04:20,444 --> 00:04:21,584
It's tight on me.

118
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:23,414
I'm not really good at this.

119
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:27,154
Please, don't do this. Stop.

120
00:04:27,744 --> 00:04:31,014
- Producer! Please stop this! - It looks scary.

121
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:32,154
Look at Gary.

122
00:04:32,214 --> 00:04:33,984
- Gary looks so handsome. - Producer!

123
00:04:34,114 --> 00:04:35,714
- Look at Gary. - No.

124
00:04:35,784 --> 00:04:36,984
(He shuts his eyes tight.)

125
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,084
My stomach feels funny.

126
00:04:38,184 --> 00:04:39,784
The ship goes really high up.

127
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:42,344
(The pirate ship of Wolmido Island swings up high in an instant.)

128
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:44,284
(That's why it's called the "crazy pirate ship".)

129
00:04:44,344 --> 00:04:45,814
Oh my goodness.

130
00:04:46,084 --> 00:04:47,154
Help me.

131
00:04:47,544 --> 00:04:50,484
Goodness. Keep your eyes closed. Don't open your eyes.

132
00:04:50,744 --> 00:04:52,944
Don't open your eyes. Why is this ride so long?

133
00:04:53,014 --> 00:04:54,244
I really hate this.

134
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:59,684
(They experience the horrifying feeling of falling.)

135
00:04:59,744 --> 00:05:01,914
I'm falling. I'm falling.

136
00:05:02,584 --> 00:05:04,014
(They both feel fear and rage.)

137
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:06,744
Gosh. I'm sorry.

138
00:05:07,184 --> 00:05:08,514
Please. Please.

139
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:11,684
(Why did I get it wrong?)

140
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:15,614
(One decision can change everything.)

141
00:05:21,314 --> 00:05:23,784
(There are chairs...)

142
00:05:23,844 --> 00:05:25,614
(by a pool.)

143
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,384
Look, chairs are set up.

144
00:05:27,914 --> 00:05:29,684
- What are they for? - They are flying chairs.

145
00:05:30,314 --> 00:05:31,384
What are these for?

146
00:05:31,884 --> 00:05:33,344
It's outside.

147
00:05:33,414 --> 00:05:34,514
(Welcome to the splash pool.)

148
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:36,444
- What are we doing? - All right.

149
00:05:36,514 --> 00:05:39,484
The game for today is "Find the No Man".

150
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:40,614
"Find the No Man?"

151
00:05:40,784 --> 00:05:42,414
- Do we have to say no? - How do we play this game?

152
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:46,584
We will tell you more about today's game in just a second.

153
00:05:46,644 --> 00:05:49,244
We have three special guests for today.

154
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:50,744
- Do we have three guests? - I think so.

155
00:05:50,914 --> 00:05:53,014
- Who are they? - It won't be fun if I tell you.

156
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:54,144
- Okay. - They can be inside.

157
00:05:54,314 --> 00:05:55,614
To find out who the guests are,

158
00:05:55,744 --> 00:05:58,414
we prepared a game called, "Dangerous No."

159
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:00,884
- Please take your seat at the back. - It's a mind game.

160
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,314
- Please take a seat. - All right.

161
00:06:02,384 --> 00:06:04,414
- Okay. - The producer is dangerous.

162
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:06,144
He prepared a series of dangerous games.

163
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:08,814
Okay. I'll sit here.

164
00:06:08,884 --> 00:06:10,184
Does it matter where we sit?

165
00:06:10,644 --> 00:06:12,984
We might not have to go in the water.

166
00:06:13,044 --> 00:06:15,284
- What is that? - I don't want to get in the pool.

167
00:06:15,344 --> 00:06:17,814
- I got this. - Seok Jin.

168
00:06:17,914 --> 00:06:20,414
- Yes? - Don't you think the viewers...

169
00:06:20,484 --> 00:06:22,184
will think it's rude of you to be wearing sunglasses?

170
00:06:22,244 --> 00:06:24,314
- I have to. It's bright out here. - I see.

171
00:06:24,614 --> 00:06:25,984
(He's in his 50s so he needs his sunglasses.)

172
00:06:26,044 --> 00:06:27,114
He has to.

173
00:06:27,814 --> 00:06:29,514
- I'm sorry, everyone. - That's funny.

174
00:06:29,614 --> 00:06:30,914
I want sunglasses, too.

175
00:06:30,984 --> 00:06:32,514
I apologise to all the viewers.

176
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:34,214
(It's because I'm getting old.)

177
00:06:34,284 --> 00:06:35,944
- You will be asking questions. - Okay.

178
00:06:36,044 --> 00:06:38,614
The guest will answer your questions.

179
00:06:38,684 --> 00:06:41,344
- I see. - The answer will be a yes or a no.

180
00:06:41,544 --> 00:06:43,644
You won't be penalised if the guest answers yes.

181
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:45,444
- What? - If he says no...

182
00:06:45,514 --> 00:06:47,744
- That's tough. - Who gets to say no?

183
00:06:48,044 --> 00:06:49,244
- Will the guest say no? - Yes.

184
00:06:49,314 --> 00:06:50,644
If you find out who the guest is,

185
00:06:50,884 --> 00:06:52,984
the guest will be thrown into the pool.

186
00:06:53,044 --> 00:06:54,714
- Really? - Okay.

187
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,344
- We must find out who the guest is. - Let's do this, everyone.

188
00:06:57,744 --> 00:07:00,014
- Don't ask simple questions. - All right.

189
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:01,944
- Ask questions that will help us. - Okay. Let's go.

190
00:07:02,014 --> 00:07:03,214
- Don't ask obvious questions. - Okay.

191
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:04,684
Don't ask questions like, "Are you human?"

192
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:05,914
- We must do well. - We should.

193
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:07,184
All right. Shall we begin?

194
00:07:07,244 --> 00:07:08,984
Okay. Please come out.

195
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:11,244
If the guest answers no, we'll be thrown into the water.

196
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:15,244
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

197
00:07:15,414 --> 00:07:16,884
(They don't have a clue.)

198
00:07:16,944 --> 00:07:18,284
Hi, all.

199
00:07:18,484 --> 00:07:20,144
- I think it's a guy. - Is it male or female?

200
00:07:20,214 --> 00:07:22,014
- In my opinion, the guest... - It's a guy.

201
00:07:22,084 --> 00:07:23,784
hasn't been on that many variety shows.

202
00:07:24,314 --> 00:07:25,884
He's very cautious.

203
00:07:26,014 --> 00:07:28,444
- Let's ask his occupation and age. - Let's do that.

204
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:29,514
- I will ask him a question. - Okay.

205
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:30,844
(This one question will determine their fate.)

206
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:31,944
Are you...

207
00:07:32,014 --> 00:07:36,784
(First question)

208
00:07:36,844 --> 00:07:38,214
an actor?

209
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:41,514
(Is the man behind the curtain an actor?)

210
00:07:41,584 --> 00:07:42,914
Yes.

211
00:07:43,384 --> 00:07:44,644
(They don't have to go in the water.)

212
00:07:45,444 --> 00:07:46,814
- This is crazy. - Okay.

213
00:07:47,784 --> 00:07:48,884
Are you...

214
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:51,014
(Second question)

215
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:52,244
in your 30s?

216
00:07:52,314 --> 00:07:54,814
(Second question: Are you in your 30s?)

217
00:07:54,884 --> 00:07:55,914
Yes!

218
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:57,244
- Yes. - He's in his 30s!

219
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,344
- He's an actor in his 30s. - An actor in his 30s.

220
00:07:59,514 --> 00:08:00,584
He's an actor in his 30s.

221
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,484
Ask him if he's handsome.

222
00:08:02,544 --> 00:08:03,844
Ask him if he has a hit song.

223
00:08:03,914 --> 00:08:05,344
I don't want to ask him if he thinks he is handsome.

224
00:08:05,414 --> 00:08:07,944
Listening to his voice makes me think that he's not.

225
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:09,444
- What? - But still...

226
00:08:09,514 --> 00:08:10,684
- What's the logic in that? - I know.

227
00:08:10,744 --> 00:08:11,744
- I know it. - What is that?

228
00:08:11,814 --> 00:08:13,114
- I am certain about it. - I have no expectations.

229
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:15,184
- His voice is hinting that... - Let's ask about his work.

230
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,684
- Ask him. - Ask him about his famous work.

231
00:08:17,244 --> 00:08:18,544
Have you starred in a movie that sold over 10 million tickets?

232
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:19,744
That's a good one.

233
00:08:19,814 --> 00:08:21,014
- Is he a well-known actor? - All right.

234
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:23,544
Have you ever starred in a movie...

235
00:08:23,614 --> 00:08:27,184
that sold over 10 million tickets?

236
00:08:27,244 --> 00:08:28,684
(Third question: Have you ever starred in a movie...)

237
00:08:28,754 --> 00:08:29,844
(that sold over 10 million tickets?)

238
00:08:29,914 --> 00:08:30,914
No.

239
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:32,814
- No? - Oh, dear.

240
00:08:33,184 --> 00:08:36,884
(Falling)

241
00:08:36,944 --> 00:08:39,714
(Have a taste of "No".)

242
00:08:41,014 --> 00:08:43,084
(Jae Seok shows us how it's done.)

243
00:08:43,144 --> 00:08:46,614
(You instantly become ugly.)

244
00:08:47,784 --> 00:08:49,684
This is really tough.

245
00:08:49,754 --> 00:08:51,914
- He's not a top actor then. - This is ridiculous.

246
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,184
- It's terrifying. - Jae Seok.

247
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:54,314
- It's freezing! - Jae Seok.

248
00:08:54,384 --> 00:08:55,944
- The water is unbelievably cold. - Are you okay?

249
00:08:56,114 --> 00:08:57,784
- It's unbelievably cold. - This is absurd.

250
00:08:57,944 --> 00:08:59,844
- Gosh, it's cold. - I can't do it! Wait!

251
00:09:00,044 --> 00:09:01,344
- Is it that bad? - It's cold!

252
00:09:01,414 --> 00:09:03,044
This is ice water.

253
00:09:03,254 --> 00:09:04,314
Hey!

254
00:09:04,514 --> 00:09:06,514
Come and put some water on your chest.

255
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:08,144
- You have to get ready. - Hold on.

256
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,254
It's crazy.

257
00:09:09,314 --> 00:09:10,414
(Everyone's shocked by the power of "No".)

258
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:13,084
- Where's my towel? - Is it really cold?

259
00:09:13,254 --> 00:09:15,444
What's this? Kwang Soo!

260
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:16,544
What?

261
00:09:16,714 --> 00:09:18,884
(Ji Hyo is terrified.)

262
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:20,514
What did you just do?

263
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:22,344
- You should experience it. - Ji Hyo, you should just go home.

264
00:09:23,014 --> 00:09:24,754
You're being so difficult.

265
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:26,544
- No! - Just go home.

266
00:09:26,714 --> 00:09:28,384
You are extremely moody today.

267
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:30,014
- Gosh... - Jae Seok.

268
00:09:30,084 --> 00:09:31,784
Ask him about his character, Kwang Soo.

269
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:35,314
Ask him if he normally plays a cool role or a funny role.

270
00:09:35,384 --> 00:09:37,754
- That's a very subjective question. - Listen.

271
00:09:37,814 --> 00:09:39,214
- Ask him if he plays the bad guy. - Ask him if he plays the villain.

272
00:09:39,254 --> 00:09:41,544
Or ask him if he usually plays a funny character.

273
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,684
(They give Kwang Soo suggestions on what to ask.)

274
00:09:43,754 --> 00:09:45,284
You're just trying to get me in the water!

275
00:09:45,344 --> 00:09:46,344
No, I'm not.

276
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,844
- What kind of a question is that? - Don't worry.

277
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:50,484
We need to know so that we can guess who it is.

278
00:09:50,544 --> 00:09:52,344
Why don't you ask if he's been on Running Man before?

279
00:09:52,414 --> 00:09:54,484
- Yes. Ask him that. - Okay.

280
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:56,414
- Have you... - It will narrow the list down.

281
00:09:56,484 --> 00:09:58,784
been on Running Man before?

282
00:09:58,844 --> 00:10:00,714
(Fourth question)

283
00:10:00,784 --> 00:10:04,284
(Have we met before?)

284
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:05,814
No.

285
00:10:05,884 --> 00:10:07,044
- See? - Never?

286
00:10:09,254 --> 00:10:11,614
(It's his first time to be on Running Man.)

287
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:13,814
(Why have you never appeared on Running Man?)

288
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:15,284
(Are you Cho Sae Ho?)

289
00:10:16,814 --> 00:10:17,944
(Falling)

290
00:10:18,514 --> 00:10:19,614
I told you.

291
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:21,714
You should've asked if he's been on other variety shows.

292
00:10:21,784 --> 00:10:23,544
(Kwang Soo is shocked by the cold water.)

293
00:10:23,614 --> 00:10:24,754
It's very cold.

294
00:10:24,814 --> 00:10:27,014
Kwang Soo, you shouldn't have asked that question.

295
00:10:28,014 --> 00:10:29,484
It's just like ice water.

296
00:10:29,714 --> 00:10:31,614
Maybe we should put some water on our bodies.

297
00:10:31,784 --> 00:10:33,254
Put some on your chest then.

298
00:10:33,344 --> 00:10:34,754
- Should I? - Get your body used to it.

299
00:10:36,014 --> 00:10:37,254
(Something feels strange.)

300
00:10:37,314 --> 00:10:39,384
- What's wrong? - Hey.

301
00:10:39,444 --> 00:10:41,514
- I didn't do anything. - What are you doing?

302
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:43,184
- I didn't do anything. - Be careful.

303
00:10:43,254 --> 00:10:44,814
If you push me, that's the end of our friendship.

304
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:46,754
Hey!

305
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,084
You little...

306
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,884
(Jae Seok doesn't hesitate to end their friendship.)

307
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:53,744
It's cold! It's cold!

308
00:10:54,444 --> 00:10:55,684
- It's too cold. - It's not that bad.

309
00:10:56,214 --> 00:10:58,314
(Seok Jin is destined to be tortured for life.)

310
00:10:58,384 --> 00:11:00,284
It's more difficult because he's never been on Running Man.

311
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:02,244
That's why I said he's new to variety shows.

312
00:11:02,314 --> 00:11:05,184
- He doesn't do variety shows. - How about this one?

313
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:06,844
"Have you ever wanted to appear on Running Man?"

314
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:08,014
- What's that? - No. No.

315
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,184
He'll say yes.

316
00:11:09,214 --> 00:11:11,244
- Don't ask questions like that. - Do you think he will say...

317
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:12,914
- he wanted to be on another show? - Don't ask that.

318
00:11:13,044 --> 00:11:14,944
- This is hard. - Ji Hyo.

319
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:16,914
- Let's ask him if he's married. - Okay.

320
00:11:16,984 --> 00:11:19,414
- Let's ask him that. - Yes, ask him if he's married.

321
00:11:19,484 --> 00:11:20,614
I don't think he's married.

322
00:11:20,684 --> 00:11:22,544
Most people in their 30s aren't married.

323
00:11:22,614 --> 00:11:23,884
Then ask him if he's single.

324
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,344
Are you single?

325
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:27,084
(Fifth question)

326
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,014
- Yes. - He's not married.

327
00:11:29,714 --> 00:11:31,144
- Seok Jin. - What should we ask him next?

328
00:11:31,214 --> 00:11:33,614
How can I guess who he is without knowing his last name?

329
00:11:33,814 --> 00:11:34,984
Let's ask him what his last name is.

330
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:37,214
- Yes. Let's ask him that. - We do need to know that.

331
00:11:37,284 --> 00:11:39,544
- I'll ask him. - Narrow it down.

332
00:11:39,684 --> 00:11:40,744
Is your last name...

333
00:11:40,814 --> 00:11:41,984
(It's Seok Jin's time to ask.)

334
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:44,914
Is your last name Kim, Lee or Park?

335
00:11:45,584 --> 00:11:51,184
(Will Seok Jin get lucky this time?)

336
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:52,344
- Yes. - Oh, my.

337
00:11:54,384 --> 00:11:55,944
- We should just pick one. - Just take a guess.

338
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:58,414
He's never been on Running Man. His last name is Kim, Lee or Park.

339
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,144
- Shouldn't we discuss it first? - Let's ask him this question.

340
00:12:00,214 --> 00:12:02,144
"Did you recently shoot a TV series?"

341
00:12:02,214 --> 00:12:03,914
No, let's ask him about his upcoming gig.

342
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:06,214
- He must have one. - I'm sure he came...

343
00:12:06,284 --> 00:12:07,844
- to promote it. - Right.

344
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:09,544
- That's possible. - Let's ask him.

345
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:11,944
- Ask him. - Go on.

346
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:13,944
Should I ask him if he came here to promote his work?

347
00:12:14,744 --> 00:12:15,944
- I will ask him... - He came to promote his movie.

348
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:17,984
Ask him if his movie is going to be released soon.

349
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:20,244
- Excuse me. - Yes.

350
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:24,744
By any chance, is your movie going to be released soon?

351
00:12:24,814 --> 00:12:26,744
(Last question)

352
00:12:26,814 --> 00:12:27,914
Yes.

353
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,144
(Yes!)

354
00:12:30,544 --> 00:12:31,744
- We were right. - I think I can guess.

355
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:33,214
You know a lot about upcoming movies, right?

356
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:35,344
- Which ones are coming out? - What are the upcoming movies?

357
00:12:35,614 --> 00:12:36,714
That's...

358
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:41,614
(Well...)

359
00:12:41,684 --> 00:12:43,544
- He doesn't know. - The one with Captain America.

360
00:12:43,714 --> 00:12:44,884
(Captain America is most likely in America.)

361
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:45,984
Not that one.

362
00:12:46,044 --> 00:12:47,344
- Gosh. - Is that all you know?

363
00:12:47,414 --> 00:12:48,844
That's an American movie.

364
00:12:48,914 --> 00:12:50,644
There are too many movies coming out.

365
00:12:50,714 --> 00:12:51,744
I know. There are too many.

366
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,144
Let's think about this.

367
00:12:53,214 --> 00:12:55,744
He's an actor in his 30s with the last name of Kim, Lee or Park.

368
00:12:55,814 --> 00:12:58,184
Park? So it's one of those three.

369
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,814
- Is he Park Hae Il? - He was on "Radio Star".

370
00:12:59,884 --> 00:13:01,514
- Is it Lee Je Hoon? - Is he Park Hae Il?

371
00:13:01,744 --> 00:13:03,444
- Is it Je Hoon? - Is he Hae Il?

372
00:13:03,514 --> 00:13:04,714
- It must be Je Hoon! - Je Hoon!

373
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,184
- He has a movie coming out. - Is he in his 30s?

374
00:13:07,514 --> 00:13:09,244
- Yes, he is. - He is...

375
00:13:09,314 --> 00:13:11,084
The producer looks frustrated.

376
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:12,784
- It's Je Hoon! - It must be Je Hoon!

377
00:13:12,844 --> 00:13:14,644
- It's Je Hoon. - It's Je Hoon and Go A Ra.

378
00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:17,414
- He never appeared on Running Man. - Are you sure about this?

379
00:13:17,484 --> 00:13:18,614
Is he the one that starred in "Signal"?

380
00:13:18,684 --> 00:13:19,684
Is he older than you?

381
00:13:19,744 --> 00:13:20,914
- He's older than me. - It's Je Hoon from "Signal".

382
00:13:20,984 --> 00:13:22,014
I think I saw the poster.

383
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:24,144
- I am his biggest fan. - His movie's coming out soon.

384
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:26,084
The other guest must be A Ra then.

385
00:13:27,544 --> 00:13:29,614
- Look. He's not laughing. - Is that right?

386
00:13:29,914 --> 00:13:31,084
(They give a bitter smile.)

387
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,314
- It's Je Hoon! - It must be him!

388
00:13:32,384 --> 00:13:33,514
- It's him! - Let's go with Je Hoon.

389
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:35,414
- It's Je Hoon. - Let's go with him.

390
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:37,284
Look at them. They look upset.

391
00:13:37,344 --> 00:13:38,644
- In 1, 2, 3. - I think we guessed it right.

392
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:41,444
If it's Je Hoon, automatically the female guest is A Ra.

393
00:13:41,514 --> 00:13:43,744
I will ask if she's A Ra for the first question.

394
00:13:44,144 --> 00:13:46,414
- Okay. Great. - That will do.

395
00:13:46,484 --> 00:13:48,414
- That's great. - Let's go.

396
00:13:48,484 --> 00:13:50,314
- She'll be thrown in immediately. - Let's hurry up.

397
00:13:50,384 --> 00:13:51,914
- All right. I have the answer. - What is it?

398
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:53,084
It's Lee Je Hoon.

399
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:55,044
(I might be wrong.)

400
00:13:55,744 --> 00:13:56,884
I'm dead.

401
00:13:56,944 --> 00:13:58,184
- He just said that he's dead. - Did we get it?

402
00:13:58,244 --> 00:13:59,444
- Did you hear what he said? - Is it really him?

403
00:14:00,144 --> 00:14:01,684
Let's see if you got it right.

404
00:14:01,744 --> 00:14:05,144
(Did the Running Man members guess right?)

405
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,644
Please come on out, Je Hoon.

406
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:07,784
(It's Lee Je Hoon.)

407
00:14:07,844 --> 00:14:09,344
- We did it! - Yes!

408
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:10,584
- We got it! - We did it!

409
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:11,744
- We guessed it right. - I know!

410
00:14:11,814 --> 00:14:13,714
- We got it correct. - Oh, dear.

411
00:14:13,784 --> 00:14:15,344
- Poor him. - That wasn't that hard.

412
00:14:15,414 --> 00:14:16,614
I feel bad for you.

413
00:14:17,444 --> 00:14:18,714
- Je Hoon! - Hello!

414
00:14:18,784 --> 00:14:20,244
- Hello! - It's nice to meet you.

415
00:14:20,344 --> 00:14:21,644
- It's really him. - Oh, dear.

416
00:14:21,714 --> 00:14:22,714
(The actor in his 30s is Lee Je Hoon.)

417
00:14:23,684 --> 00:14:26,584
(In the TV series "Signal", he played the role of Park Hae Young!)

418
00:14:26,644 --> 00:14:30,484
(Not only is he handsome, but his acting was also superb.)

419
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:32,944
- Welcome! - Hello.

420
00:14:33,014 --> 00:14:34,414
- Oh, dear. - Hi.

421
00:14:34,484 --> 00:14:35,684
- It's really him. - Gosh...

422
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:36,844
- Lieutenant. - Je Hoon.

423
00:14:36,914 --> 00:14:38,384
(I should've had my poker face on.)

424
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,544
You said you've never been on Running Man.

425
00:14:40,844 --> 00:14:42,314
So I thought it could be you.

426
00:14:42,384 --> 00:14:44,714
- I shouldn't have said anything. - Look at his nose.

427
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,184
- Why did you say it? - Will Je Hoon go in the water?

428
00:14:46,244 --> 00:14:47,944
I didn't know it was Je Hoon.

429
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:49,814
(Haha approaches Je Hoon.)

430
00:14:49,944 --> 00:14:51,244
You can keep talking.

431
00:14:51,314 --> 00:14:53,684
- I will take your mic. - He needs to take a dip.

432
00:14:53,744 --> 00:14:55,384
Shouldn't we talk to him first before he goes in?

433
00:14:55,444 --> 00:14:57,684
Look at his body. You can tell he works out.

434
00:14:57,744 --> 00:14:59,084
- Goodness. - Look at that.

435
00:14:59,144 --> 00:15:00,214
Je Hoon.

436
00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:01,414
You need to get ready.

437
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:02,644
(He gets a cold water massage.)

438
00:15:02,714 --> 00:15:04,284
- It's cold. - It's cold, isn't it?

439
00:15:04,884 --> 00:15:06,384
(It's time for you to go in the water.)

440
00:15:06,944 --> 00:15:08,544
It's his first time on Running Man.

441
00:15:08,614 --> 00:15:10,244
(Je Hoon will dive in now.)

442
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:11,744
I'm a big fan of his.

443
00:15:11,814 --> 00:15:13,384
Please say hello to our viewers.

444
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:15,344
Hello, everyone.

445
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:18,584
- I'm in "Phantom Detective". - That's right!

446
00:15:18,644 --> 00:15:20,384
I am actor Lee Je Hoon. Hello.

447
00:15:20,444 --> 00:15:22,144
(He greets the viewers,)

448
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:25,484
(and takes a dive.)

449
00:15:26,614 --> 00:15:28,244
(We won't cut him slack just because he's handsome.)

450
00:15:29,144 --> 00:15:33,114
(We hope he will enjoy the cool, refreshing water.)

451
00:15:33,184 --> 00:15:34,184
He looks good.

452
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:36,884
(Look at his body!)

453
00:15:38,014 --> 00:15:40,014
(He has broad shoulders.)

454
00:15:40,884 --> 00:15:41,944
Take a picture!

455
00:15:42,014 --> 00:15:43,084
(They are amazed.)

456
00:15:43,144 --> 00:15:44,444
- Get him on camera. - He's got a great body.

457
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:45,614
Hurry.

458
00:15:45,684 --> 00:15:47,244
(His face glows even more with water.)

459
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:48,884
That is crazy.

460
00:15:49,444 --> 00:15:50,544
Look at his abs.

461
00:15:50,614 --> 00:15:51,784
Don't give him a towel.

462
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,984
- Don't let him dry off. - Just leave the towels there.

463
00:15:54,044 --> 00:15:55,114
He looks great.

464
00:15:55,184 --> 00:15:57,114
- You look good. - Don't give him a towel.

465
00:15:57,214 --> 00:15:58,284
He is handsome.

466
00:15:58,344 --> 00:16:00,444
- Look at his body. - Look at his muscles.

467
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,614
It's great.

468
00:16:04,144 --> 00:16:06,044
Look at his muscles.

469
00:16:06,114 --> 00:16:07,114
(We love you, Lieutenant Park.)

470
00:16:07,184 --> 00:16:08,184
He's so handsome.

471
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,684
(Even Seok Jin's heart skips a beat.)

472
00:16:09,814 --> 00:16:11,014
He has a great body.

473
00:16:11,114 --> 00:16:12,314
- Oh, dear. - Look at how...

474
00:16:12,384 --> 00:16:15,784
- his muscles are so cut. - It's impressive.

475
00:16:16,114 --> 00:16:17,914
Can you do this once?

476
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:19,144
- Do this. - I think you can handle it.

477
00:16:19,314 --> 00:16:21,244
(He's muscular.)

478
00:16:22,544 --> 00:16:25,414
(They can't help but clap and cheer for him.)

479
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:27,344
- All right. - Did you see his abs?

480
00:16:27,684 --> 00:16:29,584
- Please take a seat. - Okay.

481
00:16:29,714 --> 00:16:31,444
Is our next guest Go A Ra?

482
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:33,744
- A Ra is here, isn't she? - Here we go.

483
00:16:33,814 --> 00:16:34,884
Just get it right.

484
00:16:34,944 --> 00:16:37,884
I think you had a tough time guessing the first guess.

485
00:16:37,944 --> 00:16:40,414
We will allow you to use the Guest Card from now on.

486
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:42,884
You can ask Je Hoon to ask the questions for you.

487
00:16:42,944 --> 00:16:43,944
Okay. That sounds great!

488
00:16:44,144 --> 00:16:46,414
If the guest says no when Je Hoon asks the question,

489
00:16:46,484 --> 00:16:48,414
- all of you will fall in. - Okay.

490
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:49,584
Do you understand?

491
00:16:49,644 --> 00:16:51,444
- What? - You're really handsome.

492
00:16:51,514 --> 00:16:52,544
Let's begin.

493
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:54,314
Please say hello.

494
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,784
- Hello. - It's Go A Ra!

495
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,184
(They guessed right.)

496
00:16:59,244 --> 00:17:00,844
- It's A Ra. - Should we go for it?

497
00:17:00,914 --> 00:17:02,344
- It's her! - Should I say her name?

498
00:17:02,414 --> 00:17:04,614
- They could've changed the voice. - We need to wait for our turns.

499
00:17:04,684 --> 00:17:06,954
- I'm sure it's a woman. - Is that so?

500
00:17:07,014 --> 00:17:08,084
(Laughing)

501
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:09,954
- It's a woman. - A Ra,

502
00:17:10,014 --> 00:17:11,414
are you...

503
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:13,584
female?

504
00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:14,844
(First question)

505
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:16,284
- No. - Oh my gosh!

506
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:18,884
(It's not Go A Ra.)

507
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,214
Did we guess wrong?

508
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,784
- What? - Oh, no.

509
00:17:22,814 --> 00:17:24,244
Is it a man?

510
00:17:24,314 --> 00:17:26,384
(Splashing)

511
00:17:27,044 --> 00:17:29,314
- Is it not Go A Ra? - It's a guy.

512
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:30,414
It's a guy?

513
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:31,914
Wow, he looks like a squid!

514
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,114
It's so cold!

515
00:17:33,244 --> 00:17:35,544
- He looks tasty. - It's seriously cold!

516
00:17:35,814 --> 00:17:37,114
Is it not Go A Ra?

517
00:17:37,884 --> 00:17:39,044
That voice belongs to a guy?

518
00:17:39,114 --> 00:17:40,644
- It's a guy, then. - It is.

519
00:17:40,714 --> 00:17:42,114
- It's a guy? - What should I ask?

520
00:17:42,184 --> 00:17:43,584
Shall we use the Guest Card?

521
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:44,844
- Should I use it? - Do it.

522
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:48,784
- I'll use the Guest Card. - He can make us dive if he wants.

523
00:17:48,844 --> 00:17:51,544
Je Hoon, this is a question of your conscience.

524
00:17:51,614 --> 00:17:53,284
- Please help us. - Give us a hint.

525
00:17:53,344 --> 00:17:55,344
- This person is funny. - Funny?

526
00:17:55,614 --> 00:17:57,844
Are you a comedian, by any chance?

527
00:17:57,954 --> 00:17:59,454
- No way! - That's not it!

528
00:17:59,514 --> 00:18:01,344
- What are you doing? - Oh, come on.

529
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,744
- Je Hoon... - Well...

530
00:18:04,214 --> 00:18:05,314
No!

531
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:09,884
(They all dive into the water.)

532
00:18:12,454 --> 00:18:14,084
(Giggling)

533
00:18:15,314 --> 00:18:17,344
(Screaming)

534
00:18:17,414 --> 00:18:23,144
(They can feel the chilling water in their bones.)

535
00:18:23,544 --> 00:18:24,714
- It's so cold! - It's cold!

536
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:26,844
(He's deeply satisfied.)

537
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:28,714
- It's cold! - My back is burning!

538
00:18:29,454 --> 00:18:30,484
Gosh, my back!

539
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:31,844
It's cold.

540
00:18:32,684 --> 00:18:37,384
(They are in dire need of sunlight to warm them.)

541
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,344
(Screaming)

542
00:18:41,984 --> 00:18:43,984
(Je Hoon plays along.)

543
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:45,714
Gosh, it's so cold!

544
00:18:45,844 --> 00:18:47,244
It's burning.

545
00:18:48,614 --> 00:18:50,584
- My back is burning. - Goodness!

546
00:18:50,644 --> 00:18:52,454
My back is burning so much!

547
00:18:53,014 --> 00:18:54,954
All right, Je Hoon.

548
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:57,484
That was a good first impression, Je Hoon.

549
00:18:57,614 --> 00:19:00,384
- Let's do this. - Okay, Je Hoon.

550
00:19:00,884 --> 00:19:03,644
Hey, your hair turned into spaghetti.

551
00:19:03,814 --> 00:19:06,414
- It's spaghetti. - I'm getting hungry.

552
00:19:06,514 --> 00:19:07,814
(Slurping)

553
00:19:07,884 --> 00:19:10,314
- It's spaghetti. - Spaghetti?

554
00:19:11,114 --> 00:19:12,814
Is the restaurant open today?

555
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:17,914
(His hair resembles the entrance of a Chinese restaurant.)

556
00:19:19,314 --> 00:19:21,184
Is the restaurant open today?

557
00:19:21,454 --> 00:19:23,684
- Are you open? - Is this a Chinese restaurant?

558
00:19:24,344 --> 00:19:26,114
You should create a new nickname for him.

559
00:19:26,484 --> 00:19:28,454
You made me the squid.

560
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:30,384
Make sure you add subtitles.

561
00:19:30,454 --> 00:19:32,644
You have to turn his hair into spaghetti.

562
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:35,244
(The newly released menu is called squid spaghetti.)

563
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:38,914
We can handle it, but the cameraman in the water is cold.

564
00:19:39,914 --> 00:19:41,784
- It's really cold. - It's part of his job.

565
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:44,014
- It's really cold. - It's part of his job.

566
00:19:44,014 --> 00:19:45,454
- Are you serious? - You're too harsh.

567
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:46,684
(Seok Jin is brutal.)

568
00:19:46,744 --> 00:19:47,984
Come on, Seok Jin.

569
00:19:48,044 --> 00:19:49,314
(Seok Jin is brutal.)

570
00:19:49,384 --> 00:19:50,914
That's not nice.

571
00:19:50,984 --> 00:19:53,714
- It's part of his job. - Watch what you say.

572
00:19:53,814 --> 00:19:56,084
They'd rather work than stay home and do nothing.

573
00:19:56,144 --> 00:19:59,184
- Come on. - They look best when they work.

574
00:19:59,244 --> 00:20:00,984
- Come on. - "They look best"?

575
00:20:01,044 --> 00:20:02,384
All right, it's my turn now.

576
00:20:02,954 --> 00:20:05,814
Are you in your 40s?

577
00:20:05,884 --> 00:20:07,844
(Are you in your 40s?)

578
00:20:07,914 --> 00:20:09,114
- No. - Oh, dear.

579
00:20:10,614 --> 00:20:12,544
Only we got to ask a question.

580
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,214
(Exclaiming)

581
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:16,314
He's not in his 40s. He might be in his 20s.

582
00:20:16,384 --> 00:20:19,384
- Are you cold? - My back hit the floor.

583
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:21,044
It's part of your job.

584
00:20:21,084 --> 00:20:22,614
(It's part of his job.)

585
00:20:23,414 --> 00:20:25,044
Would you rather stay home...

586
00:20:25,114 --> 00:20:27,484
- Or work here? - or burn your back?

587
00:20:27,544 --> 00:20:28,544
(Everyone should work.)

588
00:20:28,614 --> 00:20:31,184
- You look best when you work. - Exactly.

589
00:20:31,584 --> 00:20:33,344
It's part of your job.

590
00:20:33,414 --> 00:20:36,644
- That's why you are a comedian. - The cameramen are laughing hard.

591
00:20:36,714 --> 00:20:39,284
- Aren't you happy? - What a man.

592
00:20:39,844 --> 00:20:41,814
- It's... It's part of my job. - Right.

593
00:20:41,884 --> 00:20:44,244
He's so positive now.

594
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:47,044
- Burning your back is part of it. - Right, I should enjoy my job.

595
00:20:47,114 --> 00:20:48,584
- Exactly. - Right?

596
00:20:49,814 --> 00:20:52,384
- Who was in the movie? - Can you remember?

597
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:57,614
(Who's starring in the same movie alongside Je Hoon?)

598
00:20:59,314 --> 00:21:01,414
- Kim Sung Kyun? - Hold on.

599
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:02,844
- Try it. - Go for it.

600
00:21:02,954 --> 00:21:04,814
- Is it Kim Sung Kyun? - It's him.

601
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:06,114
Is it him?

602
00:21:06,744 --> 00:21:08,344
- I think it is. - Was he in the trailer?

603
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:09,744
It might be him.

604
00:21:09,814 --> 00:21:11,744
Look at his face. We're right.

605
00:21:11,814 --> 00:21:13,584
It's not him.

606
00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:14,844
It is Kim Sung Kyun, no?

607
00:21:14,914 --> 00:21:17,144
- It must be him. - It is Sung Kyun.

608
00:21:17,214 --> 00:21:18,984
- It is him. - Kim Sung Kyun!

609
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,184
It has to be him.

610
00:21:20,244 --> 00:21:22,644
Je Hoon will reveal the answer.

611
00:21:23,384 --> 00:21:24,684
What if it's not him?

612
00:21:24,744 --> 00:21:26,644
(Je Hoon will reveal the answer.)

613
00:21:26,714 --> 00:21:28,084
What if it's not him?

614
00:21:29,644 --> 00:21:31,184
Sung Kyun, you're caught. Come out.

615
00:21:31,214 --> 00:21:32,484
(Je Hoon calls Sung Kyun out.)

616
00:21:32,514 --> 00:21:35,044
(They got it right again.)

617
00:21:35,114 --> 00:21:36,784
- We're so good. - This is our day.

618
00:21:36,844 --> 00:21:38,454
- That's great. - What did I say?

619
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,414
We wouldn't have guessed it without Ji Hyo.

620
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:43,384
Hello!

621
00:21:44,744 --> 00:21:46,284
Do you like pizza?

622
00:21:46,384 --> 00:21:48,484
(He has played diverse roles...)

623
00:21:48,544 --> 00:21:50,814
Let's go!

624
00:21:50,884 --> 00:21:53,314
(and he's proven himself to be a scene-stealer.)

625
00:21:53,384 --> 00:21:56,784
Nice to meet you Nice to meet you

626
00:21:57,444 --> 00:21:58,784
I love him.

627
00:21:58,844 --> 00:22:00,544
- I watched all of it. - You are looking good.

628
00:22:00,614 --> 00:22:02,044
You do look much better.

629
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:03,914
You don't have a mic on you, right? Let's take it off.

630
00:22:03,984 --> 00:22:05,414
- Really? - He wore a nice suit though.

631
00:22:05,484 --> 00:22:07,614
He wore a nice suit, but he has to take it off.

632
00:22:07,684 --> 00:22:10,414
Sung Kyun looks so much nicer now.

633
00:22:10,484 --> 00:22:12,444
This is really something.

634
00:22:13,344 --> 00:22:15,614
- It's your first time, right? - Don't worry, you won't fly.

635
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:18,044
Please say hi.

636
00:22:18,784 --> 00:22:21,384
My name is Kim Sung Kyun and I'll be acting the role of Kang Sung Il.

637
00:22:21,444 --> 00:22:23,144
- Bye, bye. - See you.

638
00:22:24,114 --> 00:22:25,514
(Nice to meet you.)

639
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:30,944
(This is his first and last greeting.)

640
00:22:32,614 --> 00:22:33,814
He's in.

641
00:22:34,184 --> 00:22:35,744
(Giggling)

642
00:22:41,084 --> 00:22:44,414
- Lie down. - Lie here. It's cold.

643
00:22:44,484 --> 00:22:46,444
(You must dry yourself.)

644
00:22:46,884 --> 00:22:48,544
- Isn't it warm here? - You must be cold.

645
00:22:49,614 --> 00:22:50,944
That's funny.

646
00:22:51,144 --> 00:22:53,214
- It's A Ra's turn next. - A Ra!

647
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:55,344
- It's A Ra. - It must be A Ra.

648
00:22:55,414 --> 00:22:56,844
It has to be.

649
00:22:56,914 --> 00:22:58,284
(They have no doubt it's her.)

650
00:22:58,884 --> 00:23:01,314
Shall we still give it a go?

651
00:23:01,384 --> 00:23:03,784
Let's hear your voice. Hello.

652
00:23:04,114 --> 00:23:06,584
- Hello. - A Ra!

653
00:23:06,644 --> 00:23:09,614
- Hello. - A Ra!

654
00:23:10,044 --> 00:23:11,844
- A Ra. - Hello, A Ra.

655
00:23:11,944 --> 00:23:14,114
- Go A Ra! - Show us your beautiful face.

656
00:23:14,314 --> 00:23:17,114
Is your last name "Go"?

657
00:23:17,184 --> 00:23:18,984
(Is her last name Go?)

658
00:23:19,044 --> 00:23:20,284
Yes...

659
00:23:21,844 --> 00:23:24,244
(It has to be Go A Ra.)

660
00:23:24,314 --> 00:23:26,644
- It has to be her. - What should I ask?

661
00:23:26,884 --> 00:23:30,014
Are you an actress? Actually, have you been on Running Man?

662
00:23:30,084 --> 00:23:31,084
(Has she been on Running Man?)

663
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:32,314
Yes.

664
00:23:32,314 --> 00:23:33,484
(Has she been on Running Man?)

665
00:23:33,544 --> 00:23:35,844
- We know who it is. - We do.

666
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,414
You are the beautiful woman that we know, right?

667
00:23:40,414 --> 00:23:41,584
No.

668
00:23:45,214 --> 00:23:48,214
(Bye, Jae Seok!)

669
00:23:48,514 --> 00:23:49,914
What was that about?

670
00:23:50,214 --> 00:23:52,244
My goodness, that was funny.

671
00:23:52,484 --> 00:23:55,384
- She's so modest. - Hey!

672
00:23:55,614 --> 00:23:58,014
- You shouldn't have asked. - Hey, hold on!

673
00:23:58,344 --> 00:23:59,584
Hold on!

674
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,544
This is really no joke!

675
00:24:04,114 --> 00:24:05,544
- Hey, then... - It's her opinion.

676
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:08,044
You can't ask an actor if he thinks he's handsome.

677
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,314
Oh, dear.

678
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:11,284
(She got on his nerve.)

679
00:24:11,344 --> 00:24:14,144
I'll get it right. She angered me, so I'll just guess it right.

680
00:24:14,214 --> 00:24:15,384
Right, dump her in the water.

681
00:24:15,444 --> 00:24:18,484
- Gosh! - Save me, Jae Seok!

682
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:20,384
(Screaming)

683
00:24:20,444 --> 00:24:21,814
- What was that about? - What's she saying?

684
00:24:21,944 --> 00:24:25,114
- What's she saying? - I don't want to get soaked!

685
00:24:25,244 --> 00:24:26,944
Then why did you infuriate me?

686
00:24:27,014 --> 00:24:29,584
- I love you, Jae Seok! - Come on!

687
00:24:29,644 --> 00:24:31,484
- We have to throw her in the water. - Of course!

688
00:24:31,544 --> 00:24:33,414
- Let's dump her in! - Let's go.

689
00:24:33,644 --> 00:24:35,184
Would Jae Seok really...

690
00:24:35,344 --> 00:24:37,784
let an actress get soaked?

691
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:40,344
- Of course. - He's changed a lot.

692
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:43,984
But we came this far, so we can't play dumb.

693
00:24:44,044 --> 00:24:45,314
- That doesn't make any sense. - Viewers won't like that.

694
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:46,814
Viewers won't like that.

695
00:24:46,884 --> 00:24:48,484
You better not say Ko Chang Seok.

696
00:24:49,744 --> 00:24:51,014
Don't say something else.

697
00:24:51,084 --> 00:24:53,944
If I say "Go Wa Ra", it's wrong, right?

698
00:24:54,214 --> 00:24:56,284
- Don't do it! - Don't do it!

699
00:24:56,344 --> 00:24:58,644
Fine, you guys sound very angry.

700
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:01,184
- Why would he do this? - It's obviously Go A Ra.

701
00:25:01,244 --> 00:25:02,314
What is it?

702
00:25:02,384 --> 00:25:03,844
Is there anyone who'd take my place?

703
00:25:03,944 --> 00:25:05,284
Just be quiet.

704
00:25:05,344 --> 00:25:06,444
(Rejected)

705
00:25:07,414 --> 00:25:09,444
We don't have such a thing.

706
00:25:10,044 --> 00:25:11,414
What do you think?

707
00:25:11,484 --> 00:25:12,484
(We don't show mercy to an actress.)

708
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:13,584
Come here!

709
00:25:13,944 --> 00:25:15,314
- Jae Seok. - Seriously.

710
00:25:15,544 --> 00:25:17,344
A Ra is making me mad.

711
00:25:17,414 --> 00:25:19,114
- Don't be easy on her! - Just say her name!

712
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,684
- We are already soaked. - It's so cold.

713
00:25:20,744 --> 00:25:23,344
Say her name and she'll fall in the water.

714
00:25:23,414 --> 00:25:25,184
Jae Seok, don't drench an actress.

715
00:25:25,244 --> 00:25:27,244
- What? - Don't let an actress get wet.

716
00:25:27,844 --> 00:25:31,944
(Jong Kook is a gentleman.)

717
00:25:32,014 --> 00:25:33,584
(What a man.)

718
00:25:35,044 --> 00:25:36,714
(Let's protect women.)

719
00:25:36,784 --> 00:25:37,944
What a man.

720
00:25:38,014 --> 00:25:39,814
(Let's protect women.)

721
00:25:39,884 --> 00:25:41,544
Don't make me laugh, you punk.

722
00:25:41,644 --> 00:25:44,344
(You must be kidding.)

723
00:25:47,984 --> 00:25:51,544
You are seriously funny! You really are!

724
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:55,214
I'll take care of it! I will!

725
00:25:55,284 --> 00:25:57,114
Hey, this is not the time.

726
00:25:57,184 --> 00:25:58,584
- I'm getting mad. - Hey!

727
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:01,214
- Stop trying to look good. - And what did you say?

728
00:26:01,414 --> 00:26:03,144
- Quit it. - I'm so mad.

729
00:26:03,214 --> 00:26:05,284
- Gosh, that's funny. - I'm going to call her name!

730
00:26:05,344 --> 00:26:08,214
- Go for it. - I can't take this any more!

731
00:26:09,184 --> 00:26:10,984
- The answer is... - Go for it.

732
00:26:11,014 --> 00:26:12,444
(He is about to say the answer.)

733
00:26:12,484 --> 00:26:14,144
Just say it!

734
00:26:14,644 --> 00:26:16,284
(Annoyed)

735
00:26:17,014 --> 00:26:18,484
I was about to say it!

736
00:26:18,784 --> 00:26:20,714
You're really enraging me!

737
00:26:20,784 --> 00:26:21,784
- Be quiet. - A Ra.

738
00:26:21,844 --> 00:26:24,384
A Ra must be getting mad, too.

739
00:26:24,444 --> 00:26:26,944
- Count for me. - In 1, 2, 3.

740
00:26:27,014 --> 00:26:28,614
(He will really talk this time!)

741
00:26:28,684 --> 00:26:31,844
(A Ra, are you ready for this?)

742
00:26:31,944 --> 00:26:33,244
(Her heart is racing.)

743
00:26:34,084 --> 00:26:35,244
(Will Jae Seok dump the actress into the water?)

744
00:26:35,314 --> 00:26:36,984
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

745
00:26:37,444 --> 00:26:38,584
Gu Ha Ra.

746
00:26:38,644 --> 00:26:40,714
- Gu Ha Ra. - Come on!

747
00:26:41,844 --> 00:26:43,414
(She's happy,)

748
00:26:43,484 --> 00:26:45,384
(but they're not.)

749
00:26:46,384 --> 00:26:51,384
(Pandemonium follows.)

750
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,014
- Gosh! - My goodness!

751
00:26:53,084 --> 00:26:54,844
- Darn it! - Thank you!

752
00:26:57,214 --> 00:26:58,444
It's so cold!

753
00:26:58,514 --> 00:27:00,584
(Save yourselves!)

754
00:27:00,644 --> 00:27:02,784
(He lies down in the sun again.)

755
00:27:03,314 --> 00:27:07,344
(He proves himself a gentleman once again.)

756
00:27:07,414 --> 00:27:08,484
I couldn't!

757
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:12,484
So our last guest is Go A Ra!

758
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:15,584
(Go A Ra has a multitude of charms.)

759
00:27:16,144 --> 00:27:18,814
(She looks innocent but played many unique roles.)

760
00:27:18,884 --> 00:27:20,714
That's what he said.

761
00:27:21,484 --> 00:27:24,314
- This is really nice. - It is.

762
00:27:24,384 --> 00:27:26,714
We have A Ra, Sung Kyun and Je Hoon with us.

763
00:27:27,544 --> 00:27:30,014
- It's really nice. - Let me explain today's mission.

764
00:27:30,084 --> 00:27:32,644
It's called Find the No Man. There's only one answer.

765
00:27:32,714 --> 00:27:34,214
And you should find the No Man.

766
00:27:34,284 --> 00:27:36,114
- No Man? - Yes.

767
00:27:36,384 --> 00:27:40,884
The No Man is among you and you'll have to find out who it is.

768
00:27:40,944 --> 00:27:44,044
If you find the No Man in three tries, Yes Men win.

769
00:27:44,114 --> 00:27:46,344
But if you don't, the No Man wins.

770
00:27:46,644 --> 00:27:49,144
Those who lose will get the mud bomb penalty.

771
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:50,384
Mud bomb?

772
00:27:50,784 --> 00:27:53,314
I'll explain how you can guess the No Man.

773
00:27:53,384 --> 00:27:55,684
We'll give you a question before you start each mission.

774
00:27:55,744 --> 00:27:57,384
Then five members will become a team.

775
00:27:57,584 --> 00:28:00,714
If there are only Yes Men in a team, the team's answer will be "Yes".

776
00:28:00,814 --> 00:28:04,114
But the team with the No Man will automatically answer "No".

777
00:28:04,344 --> 00:28:06,744
You will have to pay the price if your answer is wrong.

778
00:28:06,814 --> 00:28:07,814
(No Man's team will always answer "No".)

779
00:28:07,884 --> 00:28:10,784
If you win each game, you'll earn a Member Swapping Card.

780
00:28:10,844 --> 00:28:13,714
You can either maintain the members or change three of them.

781
00:28:13,784 --> 00:28:14,844
(You have the choice.)

782
00:28:14,914 --> 00:28:16,414
So we have to find the No Man.

783
00:28:16,484 --> 00:28:18,684
So we'll decide the No Man.

784
00:28:19,414 --> 00:28:22,214
- Can you see the tent behind you? - Yes.

785
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:25,784
When you enter it, you'll see many phones on a table.

786
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:27,844
Choose one of the phones.

787
00:28:28,244 --> 00:28:30,144
Once you remove the battery,

788
00:28:30,214 --> 00:28:33,044
you'll find either a "Yes" or a "No" sticker.

789
00:28:33,114 --> 00:28:34,284
No one will know who it is.

790
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:36,444
If you choose the one with the "No" sticker,

791
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:37,914
you are the No Man.

792
00:28:37,984 --> 00:28:39,844
(The one who chooses "No" will be the No Man.)

793
00:28:40,544 --> 00:28:43,414
(Kwang Soo goes first.)

794
00:28:43,484 --> 00:28:44,844
Do I choose whatever I want?

795
00:28:44,884 --> 00:28:46,384
(Nervous)

796
00:28:46,444 --> 00:28:48,014
(He removes the battery.)

797
00:28:51,784 --> 00:28:54,014
(I am "blank" Man.)

798
00:28:56,044 --> 00:29:01,384
(The members each choose a phone.)

799
00:29:01,444 --> 00:29:07,244
(They all have ambiguous looks on their faces.)

800
00:29:09,844 --> 00:29:12,444
(Everyone chose a phone.)

801
00:29:12,514 --> 00:29:14,514
- Did you all check? - Yes!

802
00:29:14,614 --> 00:29:17,214
Then, I'll announce the first question.

803
00:29:17,284 --> 00:29:19,584
- Okay. - Here goes the first question.

804
00:29:19,644 --> 00:29:21,144
(Here comes the first question.)

805
00:29:24,314 --> 00:29:26,284
"Will you wear humiliating t-shirts?"

806
00:29:26,344 --> 00:29:27,644
(Will you wear humiliating t-shirts?)

807
00:29:27,944 --> 00:29:30,784
(Humiliating t-shirts?)

808
00:29:30,844 --> 00:29:32,014
- Gosh! - My goodness.

809
00:29:32,084 --> 00:29:34,614
- I hate it! - That's really humiliating!

810
00:29:35,144 --> 00:29:36,144
(Behold!)

811
00:29:36,184 --> 00:29:37,544
- That's unbelievable. - Gosh.

812
00:29:37,614 --> 00:29:38,784
Oh, dear!

813
00:29:39,114 --> 00:29:40,984
- Gosh. - It says "I'm younger than Haha".

814
00:29:41,384 --> 00:29:43,644
(He's at a loss for words.)

815
00:29:44,644 --> 00:29:46,584
Look at Jong Kook's.

816
00:29:46,644 --> 00:29:47,914
That's when they shot air at my face.

817
00:29:48,014 --> 00:29:50,414
I remember what is on Ji Hyo's shirt.

818
00:29:50,484 --> 00:29:51,584
Look at her's.

819
00:29:52,214 --> 00:29:54,614
Gosh, Song Ji Hyo. Goodness.

820
00:29:55,444 --> 00:29:57,084
You are too mean to us.

821
00:29:57,414 --> 00:29:59,184
- Gosh. - Haha's photo is...

822
00:29:59,244 --> 00:30:01,414
when he threw the ball in the opening ceremony of a baseball game.

823
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:02,714
Were you in pain or something?

824
00:30:02,784 --> 00:30:04,444
(I want to be like Gary.)

825
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,114
Gary, yours isn't that bad.

826
00:30:06,184 --> 00:30:08,114
But Haha's makes me mad.

827
00:30:08,314 --> 00:30:10,544
- Look at A Ra's. - Gosh.

828
00:30:10,614 --> 00:30:13,044
- A Ra. - What's that?

829
00:30:13,114 --> 00:30:15,284
Kwang Soo's isn't humiliating at all.

830
00:30:15,344 --> 00:30:16,644
That's how he looks every day.

831
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:19,144
- What do you mean? - That's your everyday look.

832
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:22,644
What's that on Je Hoon's t-shirt? "Come on"?

833
00:30:23,214 --> 00:30:26,614
We couldn't find any humiliating photos of Je Hoon.

834
00:30:26,684 --> 00:30:27,814
Let's make one today!

835
00:30:27,844 --> 00:30:29,144
(Let's make one today!)

836
00:30:30,584 --> 00:30:32,484
- So you all saw your t-shirts. - Yes.

837
00:30:32,544 --> 00:30:33,644
- That's not that humiliating. - Then,

838
00:30:33,714 --> 00:30:37,114
five of you will have to wear the t-shirts.

839
00:30:37,184 --> 00:30:39,344
- We must have the No Man with us. - Right.

840
00:30:39,414 --> 00:30:41,944
- We need the No Man in our team. - No Man's team has the advantage.

841
00:30:42,014 --> 00:30:43,284
We should be on No Man's team.

842
00:30:43,544 --> 00:30:44,914
- Now, we'll form teams. - Gosh.

843
00:30:44,984 --> 00:30:46,644
The three guests will be divided into two teams first.

844
00:30:46,714 --> 00:30:48,044
Then, they'll choose the members they want...

845
00:30:48,144 --> 00:30:50,144
until each team has five members.

846
00:30:50,214 --> 00:30:51,384
Okay.

847
00:30:52,514 --> 00:30:53,514
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

848
00:30:53,584 --> 00:30:54,584
(Je Hoon won.)

849
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,844
- Go ahead. - Haha.

850
00:30:55,914 --> 00:30:57,614
(Je Hoon picks Haha.)

851
00:30:57,684 --> 00:30:59,744
- I'll pick Gary. - Just choose him.

852
00:31:00,144 --> 00:31:03,284
- You chose Gary. - We need to choose the No Man.

853
00:31:03,344 --> 00:31:05,244
Whom will you choose next?

854
00:31:05,314 --> 00:31:06,814
- Good. - He chose Ji Hyo.

855
00:31:06,884 --> 00:31:08,444
- I'll choose Kwang Soo. - Me?

856
00:31:08,514 --> 00:31:10,414
(Je Hoon picks Kwang Soo.)

857
00:31:10,484 --> 00:31:12,544
That's right. Kwang Soo could be the No Man.

858
00:31:12,614 --> 00:31:14,514
- I'll choose Seok Jin. - Yes.

859
00:31:14,784 --> 00:31:16,544
- Good. - You made a right choice.

860
00:31:16,614 --> 00:31:18,744
- Good. - I feel good.

861
00:31:19,014 --> 00:31:20,114
I pick Jong Kook.

862
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:21,184
(Sung Kyun picks Jong Kook.)

863
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:22,514
Great.

864
00:31:22,584 --> 00:31:24,814
I think one of you may be the No Man.

865
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:27,114
- Kwang Soo or... - We're safe!

866
00:31:27,184 --> 00:31:28,244
We never know.

867
00:31:28,314 --> 00:31:29,544
(They are finished.)

868
00:31:29,614 --> 00:31:33,214
- Are we done? - Will you wear the t-shirts?

869
00:31:33,284 --> 00:31:34,784
- Yes. - No.

870
00:31:35,214 --> 00:31:37,684
The team whose members will wear...

871
00:31:37,744 --> 00:31:39,044
the humiliating t-shirts is...

872
00:31:39,114 --> 00:31:43,584
(Which team will it be?)

873
00:31:43,644 --> 00:31:46,284
(Je Hoon's team)

874
00:31:46,344 --> 00:31:47,914
- We need to wear them. - Gosh.

875
00:31:47,984 --> 00:31:50,284
- We should've... - It means the No Man is here.

876
00:31:50,384 --> 00:31:53,344
- Who is the No Man? - Who is it?

877
00:31:53,414 --> 00:31:55,744
- Please go get changed. - None of us is the No Man?

878
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,844
- The No Man isn't with us. - Who's the No Man?

879
00:31:58,914 --> 00:32:01,944
- It's not me. - Gosh!

880
00:32:03,184 --> 00:32:07,414
(The No Man is in Team Sung Kyun.)

881
00:32:07,484 --> 00:32:09,884
- We'll move onto the next mission. - Okay.

882
00:32:09,944 --> 00:32:11,444
- Before we get going, - Okay.

883
00:32:11,544 --> 00:32:13,914
- Question. - we'll announce the next question.

884
00:32:13,984 --> 00:32:15,184
Is it...

885
00:32:15,244 --> 00:32:17,184
(The questions can change the outcomes.)

886
00:32:17,244 --> 00:32:21,684
(What will their second question be?)

887
00:32:24,884 --> 00:32:28,744
"You don't want to eat delicacies, do you?"

888
00:32:28,844 --> 00:32:31,144
- No. - No.

889
00:32:31,214 --> 00:32:33,584
- We can't eat them? - They cannot eat them.

890
00:32:33,644 --> 00:32:36,314
- They made the question tricky. - Yes, it's us!

891
00:32:36,384 --> 00:32:38,844
- Yes! - We can have delicacies, then.

892
00:32:38,914 --> 00:32:41,084
We can eat!

893
00:32:41,314 --> 00:32:43,284
- So... - We can't eat if we're together.

894
00:32:43,344 --> 00:32:44,384
This is your second question.

895
00:32:44,444 --> 00:32:48,314
So the Yes Team will have a frugal meal.

896
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,214
And the No Team will have delicacies.

897
00:32:51,444 --> 00:32:53,344
If you win this mission,

898
00:32:53,414 --> 00:32:55,484
- the Member Swapping Card is yours. - I see.

899
00:32:55,614 --> 00:32:59,114
If the No Team wins,

900
00:32:59,184 --> 00:33:01,444
you don't have to change members...

901
00:33:01,514 --> 00:33:03,844
- and just enjoy the delicacies. - Of course, we will.

902
00:33:03,914 --> 00:33:05,544
- Or you can change members... - Can we change just one member?

903
00:33:05,614 --> 00:33:07,714
and receive a hint about who the No Man is. It's your choice.

904
00:33:07,784 --> 00:33:09,884
- We don't have to change members. - We should...

905
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:11,884
But we should find out who the No Man is.

906
00:33:11,944 --> 00:33:14,184
- We should eat first. - No way.

907
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:16,044
(When everyone says "Yes", Jae Seok says "No".)

908
00:33:16,114 --> 00:33:18,044
What we need right now is food!

909
00:33:18,114 --> 00:33:21,084
- Eating always comes first! - We can eat first.

910
00:33:21,144 --> 00:33:23,014
What's so important about finding the No Man?

911
00:33:23,844 --> 00:33:26,584
- We should eat first. - We're here to find the No Man.

912
00:33:26,644 --> 00:33:29,214
- Gosh. - What's our ultimate goal today?

913
00:33:29,284 --> 00:33:32,084
- It's finding the No Man. - No, it's eating!

914
00:33:32,514 --> 00:33:34,884
- We're doing this to eat! - Gosh.

915
00:33:34,944 --> 00:33:37,114
- That's ridiculous! - Let's go, then!

916
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:38,584
(Then we must win this mission.)

917
00:33:39,544 --> 00:33:43,014
(Both teams are moving to their next destination.)

918
00:33:43,084 --> 00:33:45,514
(How will both teams end up?)

919
00:33:45,584 --> 00:33:47,444
So the No Man is among us.

920
00:33:47,914 --> 00:33:49,644
- It feels weird. - It does.

921
00:33:50,184 --> 00:33:52,014
- It's not me. - It's not me either.

922
00:33:52,084 --> 00:33:54,084
We'll find out soon.

923
00:33:54,144 --> 00:33:56,444
(Who among these 5 is the No Man?)

924
00:33:56,514 --> 00:33:58,344
- Je Hoon. - Are you usually competitive?

925
00:33:58,414 --> 00:34:01,414
When you play games, do you tend to be well-mannered?

926
00:34:01,484 --> 00:34:03,784
- Please tell us. - I am well-mannered,

927
00:34:03,854 --> 00:34:06,744
but I believe in playing fair to win.

928
00:34:06,814 --> 00:34:08,744
Do you mean that...

929
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:11,684
you check to see if someone's cheating?

930
00:34:11,744 --> 00:34:14,944
If you watch the Premier League games, each team has its style.

931
00:34:15,744 --> 00:34:18,384
And our team tends to cheat a lot to win.

932
00:34:18,444 --> 00:34:20,614
Like Diego Costa of Chelsea?

933
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:22,044
Right. That's right.

934
00:34:22,114 --> 00:34:24,914
(Do you want me to play like Diego Costa?)

935
00:34:26,114 --> 00:34:28,354
As Diego Costa of Chelsea used violence on an opponent player,

936
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:31,384
he received penalty for his wrongdoing.

937
00:34:31,744 --> 00:34:33,684
He even pushed the player down...

938
00:34:33,744 --> 00:34:36,144
when the opponent tried to stand up.

939
00:34:36,714 --> 00:34:39,714
- Like Diego Costa of Chelsea? - Right.

940
00:34:39,784 --> 00:34:43,384
If Haha, Kwang Soo and I are in the same team,

941
00:34:43,444 --> 00:34:45,644
- it's a given. - You should cheat as well.

942
00:34:45,714 --> 00:34:47,184
It's weird if we don't cheat.

943
00:34:47,244 --> 00:34:49,014
A Ra also joined us a few times...

944
00:34:49,084 --> 00:34:50,744
and she's not a fair player.

945
00:34:51,014 --> 00:34:52,944
- Gosh. - What are you talking about?

946
00:34:53,144 --> 00:34:54,814
- I'm lost for words. - She's definitely not.

947
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,444
- When you... - I saw you cheating.

948
00:34:56,544 --> 00:34:58,184
- My goodness. - I know you cheated a lot.

949
00:34:58,244 --> 00:35:01,914
- Right. - A Ra is a pretty dirty player.

950
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:04,244
- We must win today. - Okay.

951
00:35:04,314 --> 00:35:06,614
We should use any means to win.

952
00:35:06,684 --> 00:35:09,084
- We don't have to be gentle. - He's right.

953
00:35:09,144 --> 00:35:11,544
You can swear and even hit them when the camera isn't rolling.

954
00:35:11,614 --> 00:35:14,084
You'd better be prepared to cheat in order to win today.

955
00:35:14,814 --> 00:35:16,284
Let me explain the rules.

956
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:19,944
You should clear the "Road Mission Shows" and come...

957
00:35:20,014 --> 00:35:22,444
- to the restaurant first to win. - Okay.

958
00:35:22,514 --> 00:35:23,744
The first mission is...

959
00:35:24,114 --> 00:35:26,514
- jegichagi. - It's jegichagi.

960
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:29,144
You should bring three passers-by...

961
00:35:29,514 --> 00:35:32,614
and play a relay jegichagi.

962
00:35:32,814 --> 00:35:36,244
- This is our first game. - Okay, let's go!

963
00:35:37,114 --> 00:35:38,984
Do you know how to play jegichagi?

964
00:35:39,044 --> 00:35:41,354
Is anyone good at jegichagi?

965
00:35:41,744 --> 00:35:43,784
Good. Come here.

966
00:35:43,854 --> 00:35:45,014
(Jong Kook casts the first player.)

967
00:35:45,084 --> 00:35:46,684
- Are you good at jegichagi? - Jegichagi.

968
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,244
He said he's a good football player.

969
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,444
Come out.

970
00:35:51,044 --> 00:35:52,714
- Come with us. - It's okay.

971
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:55,144
This is the order that we should go by.

972
00:35:55,214 --> 00:35:56,414
All right. Let's go for it.

973
00:35:56,484 --> 00:35:59,144
- Get ready. - In 1, 2 and 3.

974
00:35:59,214 --> 00:36:00,784
- We can do it! - We can do it!

975
00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:03,784
(The winning team can take the advantageous position.)

976
00:36:03,854 --> 00:36:04,984
Play it slowly.

977
00:36:06,584 --> 00:36:07,854
(Mission starts.)

978
00:36:07,914 --> 00:36:09,114
All right!

979
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:11,984
(Gary tosses the jegi to Sung Kyun.)

980
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,144
Good. Toss it higher.

981
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:15,214
(Gary tosses the jegi to Sung Kyun.)

982
00:36:15,284 --> 00:36:16,314
(Pass!)

983
00:36:17,114 --> 00:36:19,884
- Good! Go! - Gosh, what happened?

984
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,514
(Ji Hyo is the last player.)

985
00:36:24,244 --> 00:36:26,114
Gosh, what happened?

986
00:36:28,744 --> 00:36:30,444
(They succeed in first try.)

987
00:36:30,514 --> 00:36:31,614
We did it!

988
00:36:31,684 --> 00:36:34,014
(Yes Team succeeds the first game in 3 minutes.)

989
00:36:35,214 --> 00:36:36,614
(Stunned)

990
00:36:36,714 --> 00:36:37,784
We did it!

991
00:36:37,854 --> 00:36:38,914
(Thank you so much.)

992
00:36:39,884 --> 00:36:41,984
Let me go first. Do I pass this to him?

993
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:44,044
- That's it. - Wait!

994
00:36:44,384 --> 00:36:45,414
(A Ra misses the jegi.)

995
00:36:45,714 --> 00:36:47,514
- A Ra, you can do it, right? - Yes.

996
00:36:47,584 --> 00:36:49,884
- Can you do this? - Why don't you go last?

997
00:36:49,944 --> 00:36:52,144
- Don't you want the delicacies? - Look at this.

998
00:36:52,214 --> 00:36:53,854
Do like this.

999
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,284
(Haha gives A Ra a tip.)

1000
00:36:55,354 --> 00:36:56,854
Toss it at this point.

1001
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:59,244
- That's right. - All right! Let's go!

1002
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,914
Start.

1003
00:37:00,984 --> 00:37:02,384
(They attempt again.)

1004
00:37:02,444 --> 00:37:06,184
(If I do as Haha taught me, we can make it!)

1005
00:37:06,914 --> 00:37:07,984
(Tossing)

1006
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:12,044
- A Ra! - Mark my words!

1007
00:37:12,114 --> 00:37:14,914
- Look at him! - A Ra, please.

1008
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:16,184
Toss it like this.

1009
00:37:17,114 --> 00:37:18,814
- Do not throw it. - Try it.

1010
00:37:19,084 --> 00:37:20,584
One, two... Kick this.

1011
00:37:20,644 --> 00:37:21,884
(Kick it.)

1012
00:37:21,944 --> 00:37:22,984
(She misses.)

1013
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:24,784
(This is so frustrating.)

1014
00:37:24,884 --> 00:37:26,144
- Okay. That's enough. - Try it again.

1015
00:37:26,314 --> 00:37:28,584
- Will you please kick it like this? - Why can't you do it?

1016
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,544
Don't kick it away.

1017
00:37:31,884 --> 00:37:33,544
- Wait. - Try again.

1018
00:37:33,714 --> 00:37:34,914
You almost got it.

1019
00:37:35,084 --> 00:37:36,114
- Let's change the order. - Okay. You'll be the last.

1020
00:37:36,184 --> 00:37:37,184
Let me go first.

1021
00:37:37,244 --> 00:37:38,614
- Okay. I'll go last. - Let's begin.

1022
00:37:38,884 --> 00:37:40,084
- Hold on. - Okay. Go.

1023
00:37:40,144 --> 00:37:41,514
(They can't delay it any longer.)

1024
00:37:41,584 --> 00:37:44,044
(They must succeed in order to get the Member Swapping Card.)

1025
00:37:45,584 --> 00:37:46,614
(Mission starts.)

1026
00:37:46,684 --> 00:37:47,744
- There you go. - Good.

1027
00:37:48,744 --> 00:37:50,144
- There you go. - Good job.

1028
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:51,314
- That's it. - Keep it up.

1029
00:37:51,514 --> 00:37:52,684
Kick it with your right foot.

1030
00:37:53,084 --> 00:37:54,244
(He saves the jegi from falling.)

1031
00:37:54,354 --> 00:37:55,414
I got this.

1032
00:37:55,714 --> 00:37:56,914
- There you go. - Nice.

1033
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:58,044
I'll get it.

1034
00:37:58,284 --> 00:38:00,884
- Good job. - We're doing great.

1035
00:38:00,944 --> 00:38:03,384
(A Ra has to kick it once to complete the mission.)

1036
00:38:03,444 --> 00:38:06,214
(Will they succeed?)

1037
00:38:06,314 --> 00:38:07,314
(Success)

1038
00:38:07,414 --> 00:38:10,014
- You did it. - Good job.

1039
00:38:10,084 --> 00:38:13,644
(Yes Team completes the mission.)

1040
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:15,084
We did it.

1041
00:38:15,144 --> 00:38:16,184
- We need to swap members. - Hey.

1042
00:38:16,244 --> 00:38:18,714
- We should thank the No Man. - Thank you.

1043
00:38:18,784 --> 00:38:19,944
The person is doing a great job.

1044
00:38:20,014 --> 00:38:21,684
No Man is trying really hard.

1045
00:38:21,744 --> 00:38:23,144
No Man must be hungry, too.

1046
00:38:23,214 --> 00:38:24,744
- I see. - No Man must be hungry, too.

1047
00:38:24,814 --> 00:38:26,884
You know, everyone needs their own goal.

1048
00:38:26,944 --> 00:38:28,114
Look. There's an elderly woman.

1049
00:38:28,184 --> 00:38:29,284
- Where? - Excuse me.

1050
00:38:29,384 --> 00:38:30,444
- Excuse me, Ma'am. - Excuse me.

1051
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:33,414
- Hello. - Can you spare five minutes for us?

1052
00:38:33,584 --> 00:38:34,984
- Do you have time? - We will draw a picture.

1053
00:38:35,044 --> 00:38:36,354
You just have to guess what we are drawing.

1054
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,714
- You just have to make a guess. - In 30 seconds.

1055
00:38:37,784 --> 00:38:38,784
Thank you.

1056
00:38:38,854 --> 00:38:39,944
Thank you, Ma'am.

1057
00:38:40,014 --> 00:38:42,214
Ma'am, do you know who we all are?

1058
00:38:42,284 --> 00:38:43,314
- Do you know him? - Hello.

1059
00:38:43,384 --> 00:38:44,544
- Hello. - I know you!

1060
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,944
- You're Kim Jong Kook. - You're right.

1061
00:38:47,014 --> 00:38:49,314
- I see you on TV all the time. - Thank you.

1062
00:38:49,384 --> 00:38:50,484
Do you know who he is?

1063
00:38:50,544 --> 00:38:51,714
I don't remember.

1064
00:38:52,284 --> 00:38:53,354
(Embarrassed)

1065
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,114
- He plays the role of a villain. - Goodness.

1066
00:38:55,184 --> 00:38:56,584
- Is he a singer? - Maybe this will jog your memory.

1067
00:38:56,644 --> 00:38:59,384
- "Goodness. Hello." - "Hello."

1068
00:38:59,444 --> 00:39:01,144
- "Nice to see you." - "Nice to see you."

1069
00:39:01,644 --> 00:39:03,314
- I remember now. - Okay.

1070
00:39:03,644 --> 00:39:04,784
How about him?

1071
00:39:04,854 --> 00:39:06,814
(Does she know who Gary is?)

1072
00:39:08,144 --> 00:39:10,584
(It's me, Gary.)

1073
00:39:10,854 --> 00:39:12,244
It's Dary. Dary.

1074
00:39:12,314 --> 00:39:13,684
He's not Dary.

1075
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:16,884
(Dary must sound more familiar to her.)

1076
00:39:16,944 --> 00:39:19,414
She just called you "Dary".

1077
00:39:19,484 --> 00:39:20,514
Dary.

1078
00:39:20,584 --> 00:39:22,354
- I'm really good at this. - Okay.

1079
00:39:22,414 --> 00:39:23,814
- You can count on me. - Okay.

1080
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:26,214
(Mission starts.)

1081
00:39:26,284 --> 00:39:27,684
(Fork crane)

1082
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,744
- How do I draw that? - Oh, my.

1083
00:39:28,814 --> 00:39:31,084
Wouldn't this be too difficult for her?

1084
00:39:31,144 --> 00:39:32,354
Look closely, Ma'am.

1085
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:33,784
This might be a bit difficult.

1086
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:35,984
(She has 30 seconds to get the right answer.)

1087
00:39:36,044 --> 00:39:37,184
- This is difficult. - Don't forget...

1088
00:39:37,214 --> 00:39:38,214
to draw the crane.

1089
00:39:38,814 --> 00:39:40,684
(What is this thing used for?)

1090
00:39:40,744 --> 00:39:42,914
- Hold it tightly. - Okay.

1091
00:39:42,984 --> 00:39:45,544
- You need to hold on to it. - Is it a bowl?

1092
00:39:45,614 --> 00:39:46,714
Hold on. Let me do this.

1093
00:39:47,114 --> 00:39:48,384
Just follow my lead.

1094
00:39:48,584 --> 00:39:49,644
Jong Kook is good at drawing.

1095
00:39:49,714 --> 00:39:50,784
- He is. - This is difficult.

1096
00:39:50,854 --> 00:39:51,984
It looks okay.

1097
00:39:52,284 --> 00:39:53,914
Wow.

1098
00:39:53,984 --> 00:39:55,744
(It's getting better with Jong Kook's lead.)

1099
00:39:55,814 --> 00:39:57,484
- Please give us the answer. - One.

1100
00:39:58,144 --> 00:39:59,644
Please, tell us your answer.

1101
00:39:59,714 --> 00:40:00,944
Ma'am, take a closer look.

1102
00:40:01,014 --> 00:40:02,314
Do you know what this is?

1103
00:40:02,384 --> 00:40:05,354
- Five, four. - Don't feel pressured.

1104
00:40:05,584 --> 00:40:07,114
- Four. - Feel free to guess anything.

1105
00:40:07,184 --> 00:40:08,744
- Three, two. - Is it a fork crane?

1106
00:40:08,814 --> 00:40:10,014
(Is it a fork crane?)

1107
00:40:10,314 --> 00:40:11,314
Is it a fork crane?

1108
00:40:12,984 --> 00:40:14,084
(She got it right.)

1109
00:40:14,144 --> 00:40:16,044
- That's right. - That's great, Ma'am.

1110
00:40:16,144 --> 00:40:18,184
Ma'am, you're the best.

1111
00:40:18,244 --> 00:40:19,644
(No Team completed their mission.)

1112
00:40:19,714 --> 00:40:20,784
Thank you so much.

1113
00:40:20,854 --> 00:40:22,244
(How is Yes Team doing in their second mission?)

1114
00:40:22,544 --> 00:40:23,814
(Owl)

1115
00:40:23,884 --> 00:40:25,514
- Okay, we can do this. - All right. In 1, 2, 3.

1116
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,384
- Here we go. - Loosen your grip.

1117
00:40:27,444 --> 00:40:29,214
- Loosen your grip. - Not that way.

1118
00:40:29,314 --> 00:40:31,114
Loosen your grip.

1119
00:40:31,244 --> 00:40:32,784
- What are we doing? - You're doing it wrong.

1120
00:40:32,854 --> 00:40:33,944
- Gosh. - Stay still.

1121
00:40:34,854 --> 00:40:35,884
It doesn't look right.

1122
00:40:35,944 --> 00:40:37,214
- I don't think this looks right. - This is not it.

1123
00:40:37,314 --> 00:40:38,314
No, it's not.

1124
00:40:38,384 --> 00:40:40,444
- Loosen your grip. - This isn't right.

1125
00:40:40,614 --> 00:40:41,744
- Why don't we finish here? - Loosen your grip.

1126
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,144
Why won't you loosen your grip?

1127
00:40:43,214 --> 00:40:44,984
- I can't finish here. - Move it over here.

1128
00:40:45,144 --> 00:40:46,714
- Move it over this side. - Just skip this.

1129
00:40:46,784 --> 00:40:48,884
- What are you doing? - What are you drawing?

1130
00:40:48,944 --> 00:40:50,014
(It's a fat owl.)

1131
00:40:50,084 --> 00:40:51,114
Who's in charge?

1132
00:40:52,314 --> 00:40:53,414
This is horrible.

1133
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:54,684
(I was trying to draw an owl,)

1134
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,544
(but what is this creature?)

1135
00:40:56,614 --> 00:40:58,414
- What is that? - Hold on.

1136
00:40:58,484 --> 00:40:59,944
What is this?

1137
00:41:00,014 --> 00:41:01,544
This looks weird.

1138
00:41:01,684 --> 00:41:03,044
Can you tell what this is?

1139
00:41:03,114 --> 00:41:04,784
- Here it is. - Did I draw this?

1140
00:41:04,854 --> 00:41:05,854
You did.

1141
00:41:06,584 --> 00:41:09,884
(Can he figure out what this drawing is supposed to be?)

1142
00:41:09,944 --> 00:41:11,284
- Is this our final drawing? - What's your guess?

1143
00:41:11,354 --> 00:41:12,414
It's a chick.

1144
00:41:12,984 --> 00:41:13,984
- Wait. - No.

1145
00:41:14,044 --> 00:41:15,514
- Hold on. - You spoke too soon.

1146
00:41:15,584 --> 00:41:17,684
You have to answer when we count to three.

1147
00:41:17,814 --> 00:41:19,854
Take your time and look at the drawing again.

1148
00:41:20,584 --> 00:41:22,144
I understand why you said chick.

1149
00:41:22,214 --> 00:41:23,944
- Wait. - That looks scary.

1150
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:25,244
- What is your guess? - One.

1151
00:41:25,314 --> 00:41:26,414
- Two. - King Kong.

1152
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,884
- King Kong. - It's not King Kong.

1153
00:41:28,244 --> 00:41:29,444
(They fail their mission.)

1154
00:41:29,514 --> 00:41:30,744
- What's the answer? - It's...

1155
00:41:30,854 --> 00:41:31,944
- an owl. - Sorry.

1156
00:41:32,014 --> 00:41:33,144
- We're sorry. - We apologise.

1157
00:41:33,444 --> 00:41:34,514
(He is shocked.)

1158
00:41:34,744 --> 00:41:36,084
- Let's ask them for help. - Please help us.

1159
00:41:36,214 --> 00:41:37,444
Excuse me.

1160
00:41:37,744 --> 00:41:38,884
- Please come here. - Maybe they'll get it.

1161
00:41:38,944 --> 00:41:40,014
(She starts running.)

1162
00:41:40,084 --> 00:41:41,684
- Please come here. - Bring them over.

1163
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,144
Hello. We need some help for Running Man.

1164
00:41:44,214 --> 00:41:45,744
Could you guess what we're drawing?

1165
00:41:45,854 --> 00:41:46,854
- It's simple. - Well...

1166
00:41:46,914 --> 00:41:47,944
- Come on. - It's too difficult.

1167
00:41:48,514 --> 00:41:50,514
- Hello. - Are you good at drawing?

1168
00:41:50,644 --> 00:41:51,744
Please begin.

1169
00:41:51,814 --> 00:41:54,514
(We want all the viewers to take a guess, too.)

1170
00:41:55,184 --> 00:41:56,214
Okay.

1171
00:41:56,384 --> 00:41:57,514
- Good. - That's good.

1172
00:41:57,544 --> 00:41:59,314
That's good. Let's stop here.

1173
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:01,014
- I'm sure she can do it. - Okay!

1174
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:02,414
Please turn around.

1175
00:42:02,484 --> 00:42:03,644
Please turn around.

1176
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,514
It's small, so you should come closer.

1177
00:42:06,114 --> 00:42:07,814
- It is a bit small, isn't it? - It's tiny.

1178
00:42:07,884 --> 00:42:10,114
One, two, three.

1179
00:42:11,444 --> 00:42:15,244
(Will Yes Team be able to complete this mission?)

1180
00:42:15,314 --> 00:42:16,544
It's an anchovy.

1181
00:42:16,614 --> 00:42:17,644
(Anchovy)

1182
00:42:17,714 --> 00:42:18,714
(Correct)

1183
00:42:18,784 --> 00:42:20,314
- You're right. - It's an anchovy.

1184
00:42:20,354 --> 00:42:21,784
- Wow. - We did it.

1185
00:42:22,014 --> 00:42:23,214
Well done.

1186
00:42:23,314 --> 00:42:25,284
You completed all the Road Missions.

1187
00:42:25,484 --> 00:42:26,584
This is the address of the restaurant.

1188
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,214
- We need to get there quickly. - Hurry.

1189
00:42:28,854 --> 00:42:29,914
- Okay. - Hurry. Hurry.

1190
00:42:29,984 --> 00:42:31,314
- Okay. - Go. Go.

1191
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:32,444
- Let's go. - Come on.

1192
00:42:32,514 --> 00:42:33,714
(They need to get there before the other team does.)

1193
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:36,584
We have to either swap members or find the No Man.

1194
00:42:36,714 --> 00:42:39,984
Let's think about finding the No Man after we eat.

1195
00:42:40,084 --> 00:42:41,744
- You're right. - I don't think we'll find him.

1196
00:42:41,814 --> 00:42:43,444
We have to find the No Man.

1197
00:42:43,514 --> 00:42:44,854
Is No Man really that important?

1198
00:42:45,484 --> 00:42:48,214
Is finding the No Man still important?

1199
00:42:48,314 --> 00:42:49,644
How should we swap members?

1200
00:42:49,744 --> 00:42:51,384
Let's decide whom we should swap first.

1201
00:42:51,514 --> 00:42:54,314
- Jong Kook, Sung Kyun. - Yes.

1202
00:42:54,814 --> 00:42:57,514
- I think Jong Kook is the No Man. - I think so, too.

1203
00:42:57,584 --> 00:42:59,214
Jae Seok could be the No Man, too.

1204
00:42:59,284 --> 00:43:00,914
If it's either Sung Kyun or Jong Kook,

1205
00:43:00,984 --> 00:43:05,814
we should leave them and us three should swap teams.

1206
00:43:05,884 --> 00:43:08,584
If Sung Kyun or Jong Kook is the No Man, we have a 50 percent chance.

1207
00:43:08,644 --> 00:43:09,744
It's pretty high.

1208
00:43:10,384 --> 00:43:11,944
- We should go that way. - Okay. Let's send...

1209
00:43:12,114 --> 00:43:14,084
- three people to the other team. - All right.

1210
00:43:14,144 --> 00:43:15,514
- That's it. - Okay.

1211
00:43:15,584 --> 00:43:16,614
Okay. That's it.

1212
00:43:17,914 --> 00:43:20,514
- This isn't goodbye forever. - It's temporary.

1213
00:43:21,214 --> 00:43:23,214
If the No Man joins the other team, will he be the one eating?

1214
00:43:23,284 --> 00:43:24,644
- Yes, that's right. - Of course.

1215
00:43:24,714 --> 00:43:26,184
(Will the No Man be able to hide his identity?)

1216
00:43:32,284 --> 00:43:33,884
- It's a big feast. - Did we get here first?

1217
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,354
- Wow. - We came first.

1218
00:43:35,414 --> 00:43:36,514
Yes.

1219
00:43:36,584 --> 00:43:37,584
(Yes Team won.)

1220
00:43:37,644 --> 00:43:39,644
- We won. - That was hard.

1221
00:43:39,944 --> 00:43:41,014
It's a big feast.

1222
00:43:41,084 --> 00:43:42,484
- Look at the food. - What is that?

1223
00:43:42,544 --> 00:43:44,214
- What is that? - It's rice with soy sauce.

1224
00:43:44,284 --> 00:43:45,514
It's barley rice.

1225
00:43:45,614 --> 00:43:47,214
- Are they hiding here? - That looks so cruel.

1226
00:43:47,444 --> 00:43:48,644
Let's choose first.

1227
00:43:48,814 --> 00:43:50,314
Let's choose who we will swap.

1228
00:43:50,384 --> 00:43:52,214
- They will be leaving. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1229
00:43:52,284 --> 00:43:53,444
- We don't have another choice. - Okay.

1230
00:43:54,044 --> 00:43:55,184
You can only put out rock or paper.

1231
00:43:55,244 --> 00:43:56,884
(Haha signals everyone except Kwang Soo.)

1232
00:43:56,944 --> 00:43:58,014
You can only put out rock or paper.

1233
00:43:58,084 --> 00:43:59,184
It's rock or paper?

1234
00:43:59,484 --> 00:44:00,584
I meant, paper or scissors.

1235
00:44:00,814 --> 00:44:02,184
What are you doing?

1236
00:44:02,344 --> 00:44:03,814
- Why are you doing this to me? - What did I do?

1237
00:44:03,884 --> 00:44:04,944
- That wasn't fair. - Those punks.

1238
00:44:05,014 --> 00:44:07,084
- What are you doing? - That wasn't very fair.

1239
00:44:07,184 --> 00:44:08,344
Okay. Let's do it.

1240
00:44:08,644 --> 00:44:09,944
All right. Let's go.

1241
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:11,184
(Kwang Soo signals rock, and Haha signals paper.)

1242
00:44:11,914 --> 00:44:15,584
(Whom will they listen to?)

1243
00:44:15,644 --> 00:44:17,944
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

1244
00:44:18,014 --> 00:44:19,144
(Kwang Soo will be swapped.)

1245
00:44:19,214 --> 00:44:20,214
Yes.

1246
00:44:22,684 --> 00:44:24,944
Did anybody see my signal? Did you just ignore me?

1247
00:44:25,014 --> 00:44:26,244
(He wanted them to put out rock, but they just ignored him.)

1248
00:44:26,314 --> 00:44:28,344
I can't believe you didn't put out rock.

1249
00:44:28,744 --> 00:44:30,944
All right. You are leaving.

1250
00:44:31,314 --> 00:44:32,344
- You're leaving. - Okay.

1251
00:44:32,414 --> 00:44:33,714
How should we choose the next person?

1252
00:44:34,444 --> 00:44:35,814
Je Hoon, do you have any ideas?

1253
00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:37,484
- All right. - Wait. How will we choose?

1254
00:44:37,544 --> 00:44:39,214
- The loser has to leave. - Okay.

1255
00:44:39,284 --> 00:44:40,544
- Okay. The loser will leave. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1256
00:44:41,284 --> 00:44:42,314
Rock-paper-scissors.

1257
00:44:42,384 --> 00:44:45,544
(He signals rock to trick Seok Jin.)

1258
00:44:45,614 --> 00:44:47,284
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

1259
00:44:47,714 --> 00:44:50,484
(Seok Jin will be swapped, too.)

1260
00:44:50,544 --> 00:44:51,544
(Okay.)

1261
00:44:52,784 --> 00:44:54,884
(You tricked me again.)

1262
00:44:55,614 --> 00:44:56,784
Did you guys plan this?

1263
00:44:56,844 --> 00:44:58,714
Why are you looking at me?

1264
00:44:59,514 --> 00:45:00,684
Let's only put out rock or scissors.

1265
00:45:01,114 --> 00:45:02,484
- Only rock or scissors. - Scissors?

1266
00:45:02,544 --> 00:45:03,684
- Yes. - Okay.

1267
00:45:04,144 --> 00:45:05,584
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

1268
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:09,014
(What is this?)

1269
00:45:09,214 --> 00:45:11,144
You cheater.

1270
00:45:11,544 --> 00:45:13,414
(Hurrah)

1271
00:45:13,514 --> 00:45:14,614
He's a cheater.

1272
00:45:15,044 --> 00:45:17,744
- Je Hoon just cheated. - Why? What happened?

1273
00:45:18,014 --> 00:45:20,114
He told me to put out scissors.

1274
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:21,884
- He got you. - Haha,

1275
00:45:21,944 --> 00:45:23,114
he tricked me, too.

1276
00:45:23,914 --> 00:45:25,114
(We did it.)

1277
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:26,484
This is great.

1278
00:45:26,544 --> 00:45:27,884
This side is much better.

1279
00:45:28,484 --> 00:45:30,114
- We're not sending No Man. - We're not.

1280
00:45:30,184 --> 00:45:32,014
- That's right. - That was great.

1281
00:45:33,484 --> 00:45:35,614
(Je Hoon signaled scissors to Haha, first.)

1282
00:45:35,884 --> 00:45:36,914
(He puts on a poker face.)

1283
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,014
Only rock or scissors.

1284
00:45:38,144 --> 00:45:40,614
(Then he signaled scissors to A Ra.)

1285
00:45:40,684 --> 00:45:43,084
(After that, he put out rock and played them.)

1286
00:45:43,144 --> 00:45:44,414
He's the best among all the actors I've met.

1287
00:45:44,484 --> 00:45:46,614
No Man can be on your side.

1288
00:45:46,814 --> 00:45:48,484
We're full of surprises today.

1289
00:45:48,644 --> 00:45:51,014
I can't believe that Je Hoon did this.

1290
00:45:52,044 --> 00:45:54,284
People like you cause dramas like "Signal" to happen in real life.

1291
00:45:54,484 --> 00:45:55,814
(Je Hoon played a traitor today.)

1292
00:45:55,884 --> 00:45:57,044
I'm sorry.

1293
00:45:57,714 --> 00:45:59,144
They're here already.

1294
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,384
(No Team finally arrives.)

1295
00:46:00,444 --> 00:46:02,044
- You're late. - You are.

1296
00:46:02,644 --> 00:46:03,814
(You're one step late.)

1297
00:46:03,884 --> 00:46:05,784
- It's nice to see you all. - What delayed you?

1298
00:46:06,084 --> 00:46:07,544
We already know who we want to swap.

1299
00:46:07,614 --> 00:46:08,984
- Really? - Yes.

1300
00:46:09,084 --> 00:46:10,584
- Let's play black and white. - Okay.

1301
00:46:10,744 --> 00:46:11,884
- Are we choosing three people? - Yes.

1302
00:46:11,944 --> 00:46:13,384
- Black and white. - White.

1303
00:46:14,584 --> 00:46:15,584
Who's left?

1304
00:46:15,644 --> 00:46:17,014
- Those 3 are leaving. - Those 3 are staying.

1305
00:46:17,084 --> 00:46:18,084
We are leaving.

1306
00:46:18,144 --> 00:46:20,144
If the three of us swap teams...

1307
00:46:20,484 --> 00:46:23,644
and we get to eat, it means that it's between...

1308
00:46:24,044 --> 00:46:25,144
- the two of them. - That's right.

1309
00:46:25,214 --> 00:46:26,714
- We'll know for sure. - It'll be one of them.

1310
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,484
- It'll narrow it down. - We'll have a 50 percent chance.

1311
00:46:28,584 --> 00:46:29,814
All right. Let's move.

1312
00:46:29,884 --> 00:46:31,114
These three will join your team.

1313
00:46:31,184 --> 00:46:32,384
- Are you joining us? - Yes.

1314
00:46:32,514 --> 00:46:34,344
(They swap team members.)

1315
00:46:34,414 --> 00:46:35,944
- Who is the No Man? - All right. Look.

1316
00:46:36,014 --> 00:46:37,784
- Is the No Man on our team? - It's the two of them, isn't it?

1317
00:46:37,844 --> 00:46:39,414
We have the two candidates on our team.

1318
00:46:39,484 --> 00:46:40,844
If your team gets the meal,

1319
00:46:40,984 --> 00:46:42,984
either Jong Kook or Sung Kyun is the No Man.

1320
00:46:43,044 --> 00:46:45,144
- We're close to figuring it out. - That's amazing.

1321
00:46:45,214 --> 00:46:46,514
- It's 1 of those 2. - I'll give you the second question.

1322
00:46:46,584 --> 00:46:50,884
All of you must answer yes to the question...

1323
00:46:51,014 --> 00:46:53,044
"You don't want the feast, do you?"

1324
00:46:53,214 --> 00:46:55,314
The team that doesn't get the meal will be penalised.

1325
00:46:55,714 --> 00:46:56,884
Okay. Let's find out.

1326
00:46:56,944 --> 00:46:58,514
(Is Jong Kook or Sung Kyun the No Man?)

1327
00:46:58,584 --> 00:47:00,184
(Or is it someone else?)

1328
00:47:00,244 --> 00:47:01,514
- The No Man is on that team. - Oh, my!

1329
00:47:01,914 --> 00:47:03,114
- Do we get to eat? - It's one of those two.

1330
00:47:03,844 --> 00:47:05,214
(Jong Kook's team will have the feast.)

1331
00:47:05,314 --> 00:47:06,314
All right. Who's the No Man?

1332
00:47:06,384 --> 00:47:07,584
- Who is it? - It's not me.

1333
00:47:07,644 --> 00:47:08,884
It's 1 of you 2.

1334
00:47:08,944 --> 00:47:10,484
- Do we get to eat? - I knew it.

1335
00:47:10,544 --> 00:47:13,014
- Do we get to eat? - I knew this would happen.

1336
00:47:13,244 --> 00:47:15,584
(They seem depressed.)

1337
00:47:15,914 --> 00:47:17,214
That's too bad.

1338
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,684
It's either Sung Kyun or Jong Kook.

1339
00:47:18,744 --> 00:47:19,744
- Sung Kyun. - Let's eat.

1340
00:47:19,814 --> 00:47:20,914
Whatever.

1341
00:47:21,144 --> 00:47:22,184
(Anyway, it's a feast!)

1342
00:47:22,244 --> 00:47:24,084
- We did it! - It's a feast!

1343
00:47:24,314 --> 00:47:25,984
- Je Hoon guesses so well. - He's so good.

1344
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:27,914
Who is it between the two?

1345
00:47:28,244 --> 00:47:30,584
They're the two people that we predicted.

1346
00:47:30,644 --> 00:47:33,244
Je Hoon is sharp.

1347
00:47:33,514 --> 00:47:35,344
Je Hoon is thriving today.

1348
00:47:35,414 --> 00:47:36,644
It's Je Hoon's day today.

1349
00:47:36,714 --> 00:47:38,484
Je Hoon is amazing.

1350
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:41,044
- Can we eat now? - It's a feast!

1351
00:47:41,114 --> 00:47:42,844
- Thank you for the food. - It has all the delicacies.

1352
00:47:42,914 --> 00:47:44,284
Enjoy.

1353
00:47:47,044 --> 00:47:48,344
(They are happy that they can say no.)

1354
00:47:48,414 --> 00:47:50,284
I like something chewy.

1355
00:47:50,614 --> 00:47:52,584
Eat the meat, too. Eat a lot.

1356
00:47:54,414 --> 00:47:55,744
It's delicious.

1357
00:47:55,814 --> 00:47:58,244
The beef is...

1358
00:47:58,414 --> 00:47:59,984
authentic Korean beef.

1359
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,614
It's really nice.

1360
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:04,784
Try the raw beef, too.

1361
00:48:04,844 --> 00:48:06,814
- It's delicious. - I'm jealous.

1362
00:48:07,714 --> 00:48:10,144
They look so pitiful.

1363
00:48:10,414 --> 00:48:12,784
(The Yes Team looks so sad.)

1364
00:48:12,844 --> 00:48:14,444
Look at this beauty.

1365
00:48:14,514 --> 00:48:16,114
(Different situations under the same roof.)

1366
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:18,944
- But isn't this too much? - What is?

1367
00:48:19,114 --> 00:48:20,714
Isn't that life?

1368
00:48:21,284 --> 00:48:24,614
- Gosh. Think in our shoes. - Seok Jin.

1369
00:48:24,684 --> 00:48:26,344
- What would you do? - I am really sorry,

1370
00:48:26,414 --> 00:48:28,984
but Je Hoon's the special guest. Why are you sitting in the middle?

1371
00:48:29,184 --> 00:48:30,544
Why is that so important?

1372
00:48:30,614 --> 00:48:31,684
- Why are you obsessed... - The guest should be there.

1373
00:48:31,744 --> 00:48:34,744
- about being in the centre? - I just sat here unintentionally.

1374
00:48:34,814 --> 00:48:38,044
- What's the big deal? You sit here. - He always wants attention.

1375
00:48:38,114 --> 00:48:40,444
- What's the big deal? - That's great.

1376
00:48:40,514 --> 00:48:43,944
- Now, it's balanced. - Now, it's perfect.

1377
00:48:44,014 --> 00:48:46,084
- How about Sung Kyun then? - How about him?

1378
00:48:46,144 --> 00:48:48,344
Sung Kyun is meant to stay there.

1379
00:48:48,684 --> 00:48:51,144
- And why is that? - His head looks small from there.

1380
00:48:51,214 --> 00:48:52,684
- I must be crazy. - Why?

1381
00:48:52,744 --> 00:48:54,484
- I sat in the middle. - Don't say that!

1382
00:48:54,644 --> 00:48:55,884
(How could I?)

1383
00:48:55,944 --> 00:48:58,514
- You are mad. - Gosh...

1384
00:48:58,584 --> 00:49:00,114
- He didn't even know. - I must be mad.

1385
00:49:00,184 --> 00:49:02,484
- He's an attention-seeker. - Gosh, I didn't know.

1386
00:49:02,544 --> 00:49:03,644
- What? - You seek attention.

1387
00:49:03,714 --> 00:49:06,184
- I am an attention-seeker? - You want to be in the centre.

1388
00:49:06,244 --> 00:49:08,614
- I want to be in the centre? - He's a centre-seeker.

1389
00:49:08,684 --> 00:49:09,914
Gosh...

1390
00:49:09,984 --> 00:49:11,884
I'm a side-seeker.

1391
00:49:11,944 --> 00:49:14,214
(He's a side-seeker.)

1392
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,984
So I am the centre-seeker.

1393
00:49:16,084 --> 00:49:18,284
It's my first time being accused of such a thing.

1394
00:49:18,344 --> 00:49:19,584
(Now, he is determined to find the No Man!)

1395
00:49:19,644 --> 00:49:21,414
Let's go.

1396
00:49:21,484 --> 00:49:22,844
- Let's go. - Let's go!

1397
00:49:22,984 --> 00:49:24,314
- Let's try it. - We have to win.

1398
00:49:24,384 --> 00:49:27,544
I love it. It's going as we planned, Je Hoon.

1399
00:49:27,614 --> 00:49:29,914
We picked the two of you as the No Man suspects.

1400
00:49:29,984 --> 00:49:31,414
- We thought it'd be one of you. - Right.

1401
00:49:31,484 --> 00:49:33,614
- We guessed it right. - It's the first time...

1402
00:49:33,684 --> 00:49:36,244
we narrowed the list to two candidates.

1403
00:49:36,314 --> 00:49:37,614
(There's a 50 percent chance.)

1404
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:41,614
Then should I pretend not to know anything to make it extra fun?

1405
00:49:42,144 --> 00:49:45,514
- To make it more fun? - I have no idea who it is!

1406
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:50,284
If we are too quiet, do the producer talk to you through walkie-talkie...

1407
00:49:51,244 --> 00:49:52,914
- and tell you to talk more? - By any chance,

1408
00:49:52,984 --> 00:49:55,384
- Can you reenact that scene? - The scene with the walkie-talkie?

1409
00:49:55,544 --> 00:49:56,944
- Please. - Right.

1410
00:49:57,014 --> 00:49:59,884
(He attempts to communicate.)

1411
00:50:01,484 --> 00:50:02,714
Detective.

1412
00:50:03,344 --> 00:50:06,144
Yes, I am listening. Did you catch the suspect?

1413
00:50:06,214 --> 00:50:07,414
(Reenactment of the breathtaking scene.)

1414
00:50:07,484 --> 00:50:10,484
I caught the suspect.

1415
00:50:10,584 --> 00:50:11,814
(Reenactment of the breathtaking scene.)

1416
00:50:14,384 --> 00:50:15,814
Can you hear me?

1417
00:50:15,884 --> 00:50:18,014
(He reenacts a scene from "Signal".)

1418
00:50:18,944 --> 00:50:21,214
(They are lucky to witness Je Hoon's acting up-close.)

1419
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:22,844
Do you hear my voice?

1420
00:50:22,844 --> 00:50:23,914
(Do you hear my voice?)

1421
00:50:24,844 --> 00:50:26,144
Call him.

1422
00:50:27,344 --> 00:50:29,414
Detective Lee Jae Han.

1423
00:50:29,814 --> 00:50:31,284
(They get the chills.)

1424
00:50:31,344 --> 00:50:32,514
Detective!

1425
00:50:32,584 --> 00:50:35,044
Open the window. They're watching.

1426
00:50:35,214 --> 00:50:36,414
Detective Yu!

1427
00:50:36,484 --> 00:50:38,614
- He's talking to Detective Lee. - We're watching "Signal"!

1428
00:50:38,684 --> 00:50:40,784
- I am Park Hae Young. - Lieutenant Park.

1429
00:50:41,644 --> 00:50:43,084
Are you listening to me?

1430
00:50:43,614 --> 00:50:45,984
- Yes, Detective. Where are you? - They are so different.

1431
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:48,244
- Lieutenant Park. - I want to hear it, too!

1432
00:50:48,314 --> 00:50:49,684
I guess it's different there now.

1433
00:50:50,544 --> 00:50:52,614
It must be better now, right?

1434
00:50:52,684 --> 00:50:54,784
(He bets on his name...)

1435
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:57,684
I caught the suspect.

1436
00:50:57,744 --> 00:50:59,314
(to catch the No Man.)

1437
00:50:59,384 --> 00:51:01,614
- First of all... - I loved that drama.

1438
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:04,614
- I am going crazy right now. - We still love it.

1439
00:51:07,084 --> 00:51:08,244
It's a basketball court.

1440
00:51:08,514 --> 00:51:10,144
Oh my gosh.

1441
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,884
Oh my gosh.

1442
00:51:12,014 --> 00:51:13,514
- We have to use our strength. - I'm so weak.

1443
00:51:13,584 --> 00:51:15,344
- It's all about your strength. - I think we have to dangle.

1444
00:51:15,414 --> 00:51:17,384
- Gosh... - No way.

1445
00:51:17,444 --> 00:51:19,584
This...

1446
00:51:19,644 --> 00:51:22,984
- This doesn't... - This doesn't make sense.

1447
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,184
You want us to do this?

1448
00:51:25,244 --> 00:51:26,814
We can't even dangle.

1449
00:51:26,884 --> 00:51:29,184
- Isn't this too unfair for us? - What is it?

1450
00:51:29,284 --> 00:51:30,714
- What's wrong? - We have to dangle...

1451
00:51:30,784 --> 00:51:32,644
- and make the opponent fall. - It's that game!

1452
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:34,914
(Same mission, different reactions)

1453
00:51:35,114 --> 00:51:37,114
- It's unfair for us. - Gosh...

1454
00:51:37,184 --> 00:51:39,484
- How can this be? - Let's do this!

1455
00:51:40,484 --> 00:51:42,444
- It's unfair for us. - Why?

1456
00:51:42,514 --> 00:51:46,214
It's not like we planned it. It just happened this way.

1457
00:51:46,284 --> 00:51:47,784
Only one person can play, right?

1458
00:51:48,384 --> 00:51:52,644
Seok Jin, I am sorry, but you're not the one we are afraid of.

1459
00:51:52,884 --> 00:51:54,684
Why are you acting confidently?

1460
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:56,684
- It's just that we are a team. - Gosh...

1461
00:51:56,744 --> 00:51:58,344
- We're a team. - You drive us crazy.

1462
00:51:58,414 --> 00:51:59,584
When will I be this confident?

1463
00:51:59,644 --> 00:52:01,914
You're unbelievable.

1464
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:05,814
Before we play the game, I'll reveal the last question.

1465
00:52:05,884 --> 00:52:07,084
(The last question is revealed.)

1466
00:52:07,144 --> 00:52:08,284
What will it be?

1467
00:52:08,344 --> 00:52:10,544
(What will it be?)

1468
00:52:12,144 --> 00:52:14,184
"Will you carry your opponent?"

1469
00:52:14,244 --> 00:52:15,444
(Will you carry your opponent?)

1470
00:52:15,514 --> 00:52:16,984
- To where? - Our answer is no, right?

1471
00:52:17,044 --> 00:52:18,444
Right.

1472
00:52:18,744 --> 00:52:21,614
- We don't want to do it. - After this game, you will...

1473
00:52:21,684 --> 00:52:23,384
move to the last venue.

1474
00:52:23,444 --> 00:52:25,284
And it's about 1km away from here.

1475
00:52:25,584 --> 00:52:26,984
- We have to walk 1km? - We have to carry them?

1476
00:52:27,044 --> 00:52:29,114
- We will piggyback them? - And walk 1km?

1477
00:52:29,184 --> 00:52:31,714
The team with No Man will be...

1478
00:52:31,784 --> 00:52:33,184
- exempted. - We won't have to carry them.

1479
00:52:33,244 --> 00:52:34,384
- The Yes Team... - We have to win.

1480
00:52:34,444 --> 00:52:37,114
will carry the No Team and walk 1km.

1481
00:52:37,184 --> 00:52:40,284
But how will you find the No Man without switching members?

1482
00:52:40,344 --> 00:52:42,344
- That's true. - We won't find him then.

1483
00:52:43,284 --> 00:52:44,684
We won't find him and we will be carried.

1484
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,714
- I won't switch. - How can we walk 1km?

1485
00:52:47,084 --> 00:52:49,814
Whenever the feet of the person on your back touch the ground,

1486
00:52:49,884 --> 00:52:52,184
a mole will be drawn on your face.

1487
00:52:53,184 --> 00:52:54,284
Yes. Great.

1488
00:52:54,614 --> 00:52:56,744
- We will win for sure. - We will get at least 10 moles.

1489
00:52:56,814 --> 00:52:59,614
- How can we do this? - They will turn into leopards.

1490
00:52:59,684 --> 00:53:02,984
How could you add more ugliness to the already ugly face?

1491
00:53:03,084 --> 00:53:04,414
What will I do?

1492
00:53:06,584 --> 00:53:08,614
- We have to win and get carried. - Let's talk...

1493
00:53:08,684 --> 00:53:11,414
- after we win. - Let's talk after we win.

1494
00:53:11,784 --> 00:53:13,584
One of you is the No Man.

1495
00:53:13,644 --> 00:53:15,284
- They are in one team. - So who is it?

1496
00:53:15,344 --> 00:53:19,184
- Only two are left. - Honestly, we really don't know.

1497
00:53:19,444 --> 00:53:22,784
- I am sorry, but... - We'll know if we separate them.

1498
00:53:22,844 --> 00:53:24,544
But it's really not me.

1499
00:53:24,614 --> 00:53:26,684
We're leaning towards him.

1500
00:53:26,744 --> 00:53:29,544
- Isn't it too unfair for us? - It's too unfair.

1501
00:53:29,614 --> 00:53:31,114
- It's very unfair. - Are you trying to kill us all?

1502
00:53:31,184 --> 00:53:32,684
- It's... - It doesn't make sense.

1503
00:53:32,744 --> 00:53:35,884
This mission is one-on-one hanging leg wrestling.

1504
00:53:35,944 --> 00:53:37,484
- Hanging leg wrestling? - How does it work?

1505
00:53:37,544 --> 00:53:40,284
Each team will determine the match order.

1506
00:53:40,344 --> 00:53:43,444
Then each team member will come out and choose a box each.

1507
00:53:43,514 --> 00:53:46,114
They will wear what they get from the box around their feet.

1508
00:53:46,184 --> 00:53:49,084
And then they'll leg wrestle while hanging.

1509
00:53:49,944 --> 00:53:51,984
- Let's begin. - Let's do it!

1510
00:53:52,044 --> 00:53:53,814
We have to win this.

1511
00:53:53,884 --> 00:53:55,014
Song Ji Hyo!

1512
00:53:55,844 --> 00:53:56,884
Seok Jin.

1513
00:53:57,144 --> 00:53:58,584
Please announce it.

1514
00:53:58,984 --> 00:54:00,114
Go A Ra.

1515
00:54:00,814 --> 00:54:02,414
- Lee Je Hoon. - That's good!

1516
00:54:02,884 --> 00:54:04,044
All right!

1517
00:54:04,414 --> 00:54:05,984
You each get to choose one.

1518
00:54:06,044 --> 00:54:07,684
- I got green onions. - That's a nice one.

1519
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,244
That's nice.

1520
00:54:09,314 --> 00:54:10,944
What's that?

1521
00:54:11,444 --> 00:54:12,984
What's this?

1522
00:54:13,044 --> 00:54:14,114
(Ji Hyo picks inflated rubber gloves.)

1523
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:15,444
I got green onions.

1524
00:54:16,814 --> 00:54:19,084
But I have to be able to hang up there.

1525
00:54:19,284 --> 00:54:21,914
(Gravity is his biggest enemy.)

1526
00:54:23,014 --> 00:54:24,314
(Seok Jin versus Ji Hyo)

1527
00:54:24,384 --> 00:54:25,814
We don't know what will happen.

1528
00:54:26,384 --> 00:54:27,984
- Here we go. - Okay.

1529
00:54:28,084 --> 00:54:29,744
(It's the match of the century.)

1530
00:54:29,814 --> 00:54:30,984
Ready.

1531
00:54:31,084 --> 00:54:32,244
(Seok Jin's green onion versus Ji Hyo's rubber gloves)

1532
00:54:32,314 --> 00:54:34,584
Start.

1533
00:54:35,784 --> 00:54:37,244
That's it, that's it.

1534
00:54:37,414 --> 00:54:39,144
(Ji Hyo climbs up Seok Jin.)

1535
00:54:39,214 --> 00:54:41,714
(Ji Hyo attacks Seok Jin first.)

1536
00:54:42,344 --> 00:54:43,944
(She hits Seok Jin's face.)

1537
00:54:44,544 --> 00:54:47,614
(Let me borrow your face for a while, Seok Jin.)

1538
00:54:48,484 --> 00:54:50,844
- Oh, no. - Oh, dear.

1539
00:54:51,714 --> 00:54:52,744
What should he do?

1540
00:54:53,214 --> 00:54:56,244
- Drop his glasses! - She's amazing.

1541
00:54:56,314 --> 00:54:58,884
- She's great. - Grab him.

1542
00:54:58,944 --> 00:55:00,714
- Hey... - Grab Seok Jin's fingers.

1543
00:55:00,784 --> 00:55:02,514
Attack his fingers, Ji Hyo.

1544
00:55:02,584 --> 00:55:04,284
(But the game is not over yet.)

1545
00:55:04,344 --> 00:55:06,544
(I can't give up like this.)

1546
00:55:06,614 --> 00:55:10,644
(Will Seok Jin begin his counterattack?)

1547
00:55:11,914 --> 00:55:13,314
(Fails)

1548
00:55:13,384 --> 00:55:15,384
(Flapping)

1549
00:55:15,444 --> 00:55:16,614
(He falls.)

1550
00:55:17,884 --> 00:55:20,914
(Ji Hyo wins.)

1551
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,214
Ji Hyo. Ji Hyo. Ji Hyo, you are...

1552
00:55:24,284 --> 00:55:25,814
You are really impressive.

1553
00:55:26,644 --> 00:55:27,714
Gosh, I am so upset!

1554
00:55:27,784 --> 00:55:29,744
- I'm so upset. - I'm sorry, Seok Jin.

1555
00:55:29,814 --> 00:55:31,884
(I'm sorry, but I was being easy on you.)

1556
00:55:32,584 --> 00:55:35,584
(Je Hoon and A Ra choose their boxes.)

1557
00:55:36,344 --> 00:55:37,984
- Is it a flower? - What is it?

1558
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:39,714
It's a flower!

1559
00:55:39,784 --> 00:55:41,584
- It's a flower. - Give it to me.

1560
00:55:41,644 --> 00:55:43,214
You could tickle his face.

1561
00:55:43,284 --> 00:55:44,614
I got...

1562
00:55:46,544 --> 00:55:48,584
It's a feather. That would be even more ticklish.

1563
00:55:49,014 --> 00:55:51,444
- That's... - Please bring your items.

1564
00:55:53,014 --> 00:55:56,784
(Je Hoon and A Ra get ready.)

1565
00:55:56,844 --> 00:55:59,244
(Their appearances...)

1566
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,784
(brighten up the mood of the game.)

1567
00:56:00,844 --> 00:56:01,984
Isn't this the last round?

1568
00:56:02,084 --> 00:56:03,444
- All right. - This is the last round.

1569
00:56:03,514 --> 00:56:05,114
(But behind this beautiful match is a dreadful penalty.)

1570
00:56:05,184 --> 00:56:06,344
Ready.

1571
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,644
Set.

1572
00:56:08,714 --> 00:56:11,414
(It will be a tough match.)

1573
00:56:11,484 --> 00:56:12,544
Start.

1574
00:56:14,084 --> 00:56:15,314
- Are you all right? - A Ra.

1575
00:56:15,384 --> 00:56:16,584
They are too close.

1576
00:56:16,644 --> 00:56:18,784
(Are you okay, A Ra?)

1577
00:56:19,414 --> 00:56:22,214
- You have to do it. - A Ra, you must win.

1578
00:56:22,284 --> 00:56:23,944
- Tickle him. - Wrap him.

1579
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:25,984
- Wrap him. - You have to win.

1580
00:56:26,084 --> 00:56:28,784
(They hesitate to battle and exchange eye contact instead.)

1581
00:56:29,384 --> 00:56:30,984
Je Hoon, you can't win like that.

1582
00:56:31,084 --> 00:56:33,384
- Come on! - You can even kick him.

1583
00:56:33,444 --> 00:56:35,744
- Je Hoon, I am sorry. - A Ra, wrap his waist.

1584
00:56:35,844 --> 00:56:38,384
(I'm sorry, Je Hoon.)

1585
00:56:39,984 --> 00:56:41,444
(She kicks Je Hoon lightly.)

1586
00:56:43,144 --> 00:56:44,884
(She just touches him lightly.)

1587
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:52,014
(This is strange. This game is supposed to be...)

1588
00:56:52,744 --> 00:56:54,814
(a merciless war.)

1589
00:56:54,884 --> 00:56:56,614
No. You are amazing.

1590
00:56:56,684 --> 00:56:59,314
- Wrap your legs around him. - Grab him.

1591
00:56:59,384 --> 00:57:01,644
I am sorry, Je Hoon.

1592
00:57:01,714 --> 00:57:03,414
- That's it, A Ra. - I don't know where to attack.

1593
00:57:03,484 --> 00:57:05,144
You have to wrap your legs around his waist to win.

1594
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:07,184
(She falls.)

1595
00:57:08,414 --> 00:57:10,744
Yes! I knew it!

1596
00:57:10,814 --> 00:57:12,914
(What happened? Did Je Hoon do something?)

1597
00:57:12,984 --> 00:57:14,714
He's perfect. He's handsome and strong.

1598
00:57:14,784 --> 00:57:17,144
- It's tough to stay hanging. - It's tough for a girl.

1599
00:57:18,314 --> 00:57:22,714
(Currently, No Team is winning by 1 point.)

1600
00:57:24,014 --> 00:57:28,714
(Sung Kyun versus Jae Seok)

1601
00:57:28,784 --> 00:57:29,844
Ready.

1602
00:57:29,914 --> 00:57:31,684
Get set, go!

1603
00:57:31,984 --> 00:57:34,984
- He's getting right into it. - Look at him go.

1604
00:57:35,044 --> 00:57:36,484
(Jae Seok surprises Sung Kyun.)

1605
00:57:36,544 --> 00:57:37,744
Raise them higher!

1606
00:57:37,884 --> 00:57:40,384
(He rests his legs on Sung Kyun's bar.)

1607
00:57:41,244 --> 00:57:43,414
- It didn't work. - I don't think this is right.

1608
00:57:43,784 --> 00:57:45,584
(It didn't work.)

1609
00:57:45,644 --> 00:57:48,314
- It didn't work. - What am I doing?

1610
00:57:48,384 --> 00:57:50,214
- Hold on. - This is unpredictable.

1611
00:57:50,284 --> 00:57:51,584
Sung Kyun, you might win.

1612
00:57:51,714 --> 00:57:54,384
- Jae Seok, bite him. - Raise them the other way.

1613
00:57:54,484 --> 00:57:56,384
- Where? - Go the other way.

1614
00:57:56,444 --> 00:57:57,814
Lift yourself with your arms.

1615
00:57:57,884 --> 00:57:59,844
(Biting)

1616
00:57:59,914 --> 00:58:01,284
Did you bite him?

1617
00:58:01,584 --> 00:58:04,044
- He bit him. - He bit his foot.

1618
00:58:06,484 --> 00:58:10,344
(Nobody thought it would be an easy match,)

1619
00:58:10,414 --> 00:58:13,514
(but they didn't think it would be this extreme.)

1620
00:58:13,584 --> 00:58:15,644
Good job. Way to go.

1621
00:58:16,944 --> 00:58:18,284
Poke his bottom.

1622
00:58:18,344 --> 00:58:19,984
(Jong Kook tells Sung Kyun to poke Jae Seok's bottom.)

1623
00:58:20,144 --> 00:58:24,384
(He pokes Jae Seok's bottom.)

1624
00:58:24,444 --> 00:58:25,714
(Sung Kyun attacks back.)

1625
00:58:25,784 --> 00:58:26,884
Look at him.

1626
00:58:27,144 --> 00:58:28,384
(Shaking)

1627
00:58:29,284 --> 00:58:32,084
(Let's send him to the other side of the world!)

1628
00:58:32,144 --> 00:58:33,514
(Please do not try this at home.)

1629
00:58:33,584 --> 00:58:36,014
- Isn't that too deep? - Goodness.

1630
00:58:36,214 --> 00:58:38,244
- That's too much. - Gosh.

1631
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:39,484
Isn't that too deep?

1632
00:58:39,544 --> 00:58:42,884
(Jae Seok succumbs to it and drops.)

1633
00:58:42,944 --> 00:58:44,244
What was that about?

1634
00:58:44,414 --> 00:58:45,814
- That wasn't expected. - Hey.

1635
00:58:45,884 --> 00:58:48,084
- What was that about? - That was a good match.

1636
00:58:48,144 --> 00:58:50,014
- Hey, Sung Kyun. - We won.

1637
00:58:50,744 --> 00:58:52,384
How could you do this?

1638
00:58:52,544 --> 00:58:54,814
Jae Seok, that was close to a colonoscopy.

1639
00:58:54,884 --> 00:58:57,244
His hand disappeared completely.

1640
00:58:57,314 --> 00:58:58,514
- Hey. - Did you see what he did?

1641
00:58:58,584 --> 00:59:00,084
Come on, Sung Kyun.

1642
00:59:00,244 --> 00:59:02,514
Did you find any polyps in there?

1643
00:59:02,584 --> 00:59:04,444
- Ji Hyo. - There weren't any.

1644
00:59:05,414 --> 00:59:07,284
- That's good to hear. - Did you get a colonoscopy?

1645
00:59:07,344 --> 00:59:08,914
- Jae Seok. - Congratulations.

1646
00:59:08,984 --> 00:59:10,414
He really poked me hard.

1647
00:59:10,484 --> 00:59:13,114
Sung Kyun is enthusiastic, but he doesn't understand comedy.

1648
00:59:13,844 --> 00:59:16,384
- Is that right? - He didn't have to poke that deep.

1649
00:59:16,614 --> 00:59:19,284
- It was this much. - I thought he was an anaconda.

1650
00:59:19,344 --> 00:59:20,944
- Even his arm... - Hold on.

1651
00:59:21,084 --> 00:59:22,884
- He's a cobra. - This is a first.

1652
00:59:22,944 --> 00:59:26,044
Ji Hyo, I'm leaving it at that because I'm on television.

1653
00:59:26,114 --> 00:59:28,584
- Oh, gosh. - This is part of the act.

1654
00:59:28,644 --> 00:59:29,744
(Was he always this competitive?)

1655
00:59:29,984 --> 00:59:31,944
One of you is the No Man.

1656
00:59:32,114 --> 00:59:34,244
Who is it? Tell us who the No Man is.

1657
00:59:34,314 --> 00:59:35,944
It's not me.

1658
00:59:36,014 --> 00:59:38,014
- We are leaning towards him. - We are.

1659
00:59:38,484 --> 00:59:40,544
- It's not me. - We never know.

1660
00:59:40,614 --> 00:59:42,414
(Was he trying so hard because he's the No Man?)

1661
00:59:42,484 --> 00:59:43,614
Is this allowed?

1662
00:59:43,784 --> 00:59:46,284
- You can't do anything about it. - You should have worn a diaper.

1663
00:59:46,344 --> 00:59:49,114
Why would I wear a diaper? He went too far.

1664
00:59:49,444 --> 00:59:51,284
I'm sorry. I apologise.

1665
00:59:52,014 --> 00:59:54,684
- So the final score is 3 to 1. - That's right.

1666
00:59:54,744 --> 00:59:57,314
- We can do a match worth 2 points. - Let's do it for 10 points.

1667
00:59:57,484 --> 01:00:00,584
Hold on. You were the only one who lost on your team.

1668
01:00:00,984 --> 01:00:03,444
- Why are you showing off? - So?

1669
01:00:03,644 --> 01:00:06,184
- Don't boss us around. - I'm on this side.

1670
01:00:06,244 --> 01:00:08,744
- This is my team. - I am at a loss for words.

1671
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:11,184
We can give you up to 100 points, but you need to bet on something.

1672
01:00:11,244 --> 01:00:12,684
- Did you say 100 points? - Yes.

1673
01:00:13,184 --> 01:00:14,344
You need to give up something.

1674
01:00:14,414 --> 01:00:16,314
- Doesn't that hurt your pride? - We don't have to do this.

1675
01:00:16,384 --> 01:00:17,584
I won't do it!

1676
01:00:18,384 --> 01:00:20,214
Don't do it, then! Forget it.

1677
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:21,744
There's no reason for us to do this.

1678
01:00:21,814 --> 01:00:23,514
I do want to win,

1679
01:00:23,584 --> 01:00:25,614
so let's do a match worth 400 points.

1680
01:00:25,844 --> 01:00:27,984
I won't play dirty any more.

1681
01:00:28,214 --> 01:00:29,684
If I lose, I'll admit my failure.

1682
01:00:30,114 --> 01:00:31,844
If we lose, we'll give you 2.5 trillion points.

1683
01:00:31,884 --> 01:00:32,884
(We're willing to put 2.5 trillion points on the line.)

1684
01:00:32,914 --> 01:00:34,284
You're getting on my nerves.

1685
01:00:34,484 --> 01:00:36,644
- You're getting on my nerves. - You can take 2.5 trillion points.

1686
01:00:36,714 --> 01:00:38,784
If we lose, we'll even give you a piggy back ride home.

1687
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:39,884
All right.

1688
01:00:40,184 --> 01:00:41,214
I'll go.

1689
01:00:41,284 --> 01:00:43,944
(Jae Seok will compete in this crucial match.)

1690
01:00:44,014 --> 01:00:46,484
- Give him a gastroscopy this time. - It's worth 10 trillion points.

1691
01:00:46,544 --> 01:00:47,744
(We meet again.)

1692
01:00:47,814 --> 01:00:49,784
- In 1, 2, 3. - Yes!

1693
01:00:49,944 --> 01:00:53,514
(Jong Kook versus Jae Seok)

1694
01:00:53,584 --> 01:00:55,184
Ready, go!

1695
01:00:59,884 --> 01:01:01,314
Give him a face massage.

1696
01:01:01,484 --> 01:01:03,644
- Use your feet. - You've done this before.

1697
01:01:04,044 --> 01:01:05,514
Lucky you, Jae Seok.

1698
01:01:05,584 --> 01:01:06,644
(You've come again, my dear customer.)

1699
01:01:06,714 --> 01:01:08,244
- Hey. - This is humiliating.

1700
01:01:09,114 --> 01:01:10,114
Gosh.

1701
01:01:11,114 --> 01:01:12,244
(Struggling)

1702
01:01:12,314 --> 01:01:13,584
Your feet stink.

1703
01:01:13,684 --> 01:01:14,814
(Jong Kook's feet stink.)

1704
01:01:14,884 --> 01:01:16,114
(Don't my feet smell nice?)

1705
01:01:16,184 --> 01:01:17,214
You're so cute.

1706
01:01:17,384 --> 01:01:20,844
- Go, Jae Seok! - Go, Jae Seok!

1707
01:01:21,114 --> 01:01:23,844
- Go, Jae Seok! - Go, Jae Seok!

1708
01:01:24,744 --> 01:01:27,884
He's good at giving a meridian massage.

1709
01:01:28,044 --> 01:01:29,114
(Jong Kook starts rubbing Jae Seok's face again.)

1710
01:01:29,184 --> 01:01:30,514
This isn't right.

1711
01:01:31,014 --> 01:01:32,084
(Dropping)

1712
01:01:33,144 --> 01:01:34,444
That's our win.

1713
01:01:34,514 --> 01:01:35,784
(You're welcome to challenge me again.)

1714
01:01:35,844 --> 01:01:38,714
- We wanted to give you more points. - Couldn't you do better?

1715
01:01:38,984 --> 01:01:40,584
It was right on the table.

1716
01:01:40,644 --> 01:01:41,684
(That was fun.)

1717
01:01:41,744 --> 01:01:42,814
Gosh.

1718
01:01:43,484 --> 01:01:46,844
So the final score is 2,500,000,000,405 to 1.

1719
01:01:46,914 --> 01:01:48,714
(The No Team takes the win.)

1720
01:01:48,784 --> 01:01:52,214
- 2.5 trillion to... - It's 2,500,000,000,405 to 1.

1721
01:01:52,384 --> 01:01:53,544
What did you say?

1722
01:01:53,614 --> 01:01:55,314
(The score went from 3 to 1 to 2.5 trillion to 1.)

1723
01:01:55,384 --> 01:01:57,484
- That's a big difference. - It is.

1724
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:00,344
This is how you become penniless.

1725
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:01,414
(This is why you shouldn't gamble.)

1726
01:02:01,644 --> 01:02:03,714
- You need to run away. - Life turns itself around...

1727
01:02:03,784 --> 01:02:05,884
- in a split second. - You shouldn't invest everything.

1728
01:02:05,944 --> 01:02:07,484
(This game taught them a life lesson.)

1729
01:02:08,484 --> 01:02:10,944
- The No Team is the winner. - I'm exhausted.

1730
01:02:11,014 --> 01:02:12,284
- Yes. - Great.

1731
01:02:13,084 --> 01:02:16,114
- Oh, gosh. - Yes Men, think about this.

1732
01:02:16,184 --> 01:02:18,414
- What? - Let's rip their name tags.

1733
01:02:18,884 --> 01:02:20,844
What if we rip Sung Kyun's...

1734
01:02:21,044 --> 01:02:23,484
- and find out that he's the No Man. - Then, we have to take the penalty.

1735
01:02:23,544 --> 01:02:25,244
- Exactly. - Why would we risk that chance?

1736
01:02:25,314 --> 01:02:26,714
Then, give us Jong Kook.

1737
01:02:26,844 --> 01:02:29,814
- What if it's not him? - What if he's the No Man?

1738
01:02:29,884 --> 01:02:31,544
- What do you mean? - What do you want us to do?

1739
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:32,844
- Who'll give him a piggy back ride? - To be honest,

1740
01:02:32,914 --> 01:02:35,384
I'd rather not separate from him.

1741
01:02:35,444 --> 01:02:37,444
- I want to be on his side. - Did we just play...

1742
01:02:37,514 --> 01:02:40,284
that game to narrow down the No Man?

1743
01:02:41,184 --> 01:02:43,244
- She's upset. - This is too...

1744
01:02:43,314 --> 01:02:44,444
She's upset.

1745
01:02:44,514 --> 01:02:46,444
- This is unfair. - Go over to them.

1746
01:02:46,514 --> 01:02:48,414
- We need a different game. - Complain for us.

1747
01:02:48,484 --> 01:02:50,684
We have to separate the No Man candidates.

1748
01:02:50,744 --> 01:02:53,184
- A win won't do. - That's right, A Ra.

1749
01:02:53,244 --> 01:02:54,814
- At this stage, - She's upset.

1750
01:02:54,884 --> 01:02:56,714
don't we need to talk this over in a quiet space?

1751
01:02:56,784 --> 01:02:58,884
It's fine if we have to give them a piggy back ride.

1752
01:02:58,944 --> 01:03:01,684
- But we'll get mud-bombed. - We have to find the No Man.

1753
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:03,544
- You guys are impossible! - We'll get mud-bombed.

1754
01:03:03,614 --> 01:03:05,914
- Can't you tell? - Then, let's not do the piggy back.

1755
01:03:06,384 --> 01:03:08,184
Let's just take the mud bomb.

1756
01:03:08,544 --> 01:03:10,744
- Seriously? - You take it on your own!

1757
01:03:10,814 --> 01:03:12,444
Do you think that's fair?

1758
01:03:12,784 --> 01:03:14,614
- This is not a joke! - This isn't fair.

1759
01:03:14,784 --> 01:03:16,984
- I have a bad back. - We should have done this before.

1760
01:03:17,044 --> 01:03:19,044
- It's better to take the mud bomb. - Listen.

1761
01:03:19,114 --> 01:03:20,784
- He has a disc problem. - Don't put yourself through this.

1762
01:03:20,844 --> 01:03:22,514
- I can't do this. - We'll be giving piggy back rides,

1763
01:03:22,584 --> 01:03:24,844
- but we'll all be mud-bombed. - One thing is for certain.

1764
01:03:25,114 --> 01:03:26,584
- You're wrong. - Why should we be punished?

1765
01:03:26,644 --> 01:03:28,114
We won so why should we be punished?

1766
01:03:28,184 --> 01:03:30,384
You know what the best scenario is? If we do neither...

1767
01:03:30,444 --> 01:03:32,014
- of the punishments. - Exactly.

1768
01:03:32,084 --> 01:03:33,414
- Why would we... - We can just choose.

1769
01:03:33,484 --> 01:03:35,214
- It's a 50 percent chance. - That's right.

1770
01:03:35,314 --> 01:03:38,344
Hold on. Sir, what are you doing in this group?

1771
01:03:38,444 --> 01:03:41,644
- What's your role in the group? - I'm a member of this team.

1772
01:03:41,714 --> 01:03:42,884
(I'm a member of this team.)

1773
01:03:42,914 --> 01:03:45,384
- I guess you didn't know. - Sir.

1774
01:03:45,444 --> 01:03:47,584
So, No Man Team.

1775
01:03:47,884 --> 01:03:49,514
- Are you switching members? - No.

1776
01:03:49,584 --> 01:03:51,144
(The No Team is not switching their members.)

1777
01:03:51,214 --> 01:03:52,714
Give us one person.

1778
01:03:52,784 --> 01:03:54,184
- Who? - I'm a Yes Man,

1779
01:03:54,244 --> 01:03:56,944
but I'm going to avoid the piggy back ride.

1780
01:03:57,014 --> 01:03:59,044
Can't we find the No Man in the next match?

1781
01:03:59,514 --> 01:04:03,584
(Sung Kyun or Jong Kook)

1782
01:04:03,644 --> 01:04:06,884
(Which one of them is the No Man?)

1783
01:04:06,944 --> 01:04:08,584
(Find the No Man.)

1784
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:10,914
(Jong Kook is the strongest candidate.)

1785
01:04:11,384 --> 01:04:13,144
- Am I heavy? - It's okay.

1786
01:04:13,384 --> 01:04:15,414
- I'll hold you close. - Oh, dear.

1787
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:17,144
(If the feet of the person on the back touches the ground,)

1788
01:04:17,214 --> 01:04:18,344
(they get to draw a dot.)

1789
01:04:18,614 --> 01:04:19,684
(His feet touches the ground.)

1790
01:04:19,744 --> 01:04:21,014
My feet touched the ground.

1791
01:04:21,314 --> 01:04:22,844
(Kwang Soo's legs are too long.)

1792
01:04:22,914 --> 01:04:25,244
Wait, you only took five steps.

1793
01:04:25,314 --> 01:04:26,844
- No! - You took five steps.

1794
01:04:26,914 --> 01:04:28,014
(He draws five dots.)

1795
01:04:28,344 --> 01:04:29,644
- We're almost there. - It's here, right?

1796
01:04:29,744 --> 01:04:31,384
Hold on. In 1, 2, 3.

1797
01:04:31,444 --> 01:04:32,584
(Here we go.)

1798
01:04:33,414 --> 01:04:34,714
We're here.

1799
01:04:34,784 --> 01:04:37,014
(A Ra brings Je Hoon across the finish line.)

1800
01:04:37,114 --> 01:04:38,244
You did well.

1801
01:04:38,314 --> 01:04:41,584
(I did it.)

1802
01:04:42,514 --> 01:04:46,384
(Jae Seok takes Sung Kyun for a piggy back ride.)

1803
01:04:46,444 --> 01:04:48,884
(He looks like a son carrying his father.)

1804
01:04:48,944 --> 01:04:49,984
I passed.

1805
01:04:50,584 --> 01:04:53,744
(All five of them cleared the mission.)

1806
01:04:55,414 --> 01:04:56,714
This is the day.

1807
01:04:56,784 --> 01:04:58,384
(They'll make their final choice.)

1808
01:04:58,784 --> 01:05:00,684
This is the final moment.

1809
01:05:00,944 --> 01:05:02,844
- There's 10 of you, right? - Yes.

1810
01:05:02,914 --> 01:05:05,684
If the majority doesn't guess the right No Man,

1811
01:05:05,744 --> 01:05:07,914
- Yes Men will be punished. - everyone except the No Man...

1812
01:05:07,984 --> 01:05:09,184
will be mud-bombed.

1813
01:05:09,244 --> 01:05:11,584
But if the majority guesses the right No Man,

1814
01:05:11,684 --> 01:05:13,444
then only the No Man will be mud-bombed.

1815
01:05:13,514 --> 01:05:15,584
The No Man won't write their own name then, right?

1816
01:05:15,644 --> 01:05:17,084
- That's right. - Yes.

1817
01:05:17,144 --> 01:05:18,644
(Sung Kyun and Jong Kook are the likely candidates.)

1818
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:19,914
- Right, Sung Kyun? - Yes.

1819
01:05:19,984 --> 01:05:21,044
Are you going to write your name?

1820
01:05:21,114 --> 01:05:23,014
I'm going to write Jong Kook's name.

1821
01:05:24,944 --> 01:05:25,984
(Blinking)

1822
01:05:26,814 --> 01:05:27,814
(Staring)

1823
01:05:27,884 --> 01:05:29,684
It's you, Sung Kyun.

1824
01:05:29,744 --> 01:05:31,714
(Sung Kyun is surprised while Jong Kook remains calm.)

1825
01:05:31,784 --> 01:05:33,644
- They'll pick each other. - He's acting.

1826
01:05:33,714 --> 01:05:35,184
Shouldn't we ask them to say a few words?

1827
01:05:35,244 --> 01:05:36,784
Let's hear their closing arguments.

1828
01:05:36,844 --> 01:05:38,514
- Let me make my closing argument. - Good.

1829
01:05:38,584 --> 01:05:40,314
If I was the No Man,

1830
01:05:41,114 --> 01:05:43,244
I would have said it wasn't me.

1831
01:05:43,544 --> 01:05:46,714
But since I'm not the No Man, I'm saying I'm not.

1832
01:05:46,784 --> 01:05:49,444
- I follow what you are saying. - Can I have a pen?

1833
01:05:49,514 --> 01:05:51,784
I understand what you are saying but your face...

1834
01:05:51,844 --> 01:05:53,514
- says otherwise. - I'm not convinced with that face.

1835
01:05:53,584 --> 01:05:55,014
I'll bet...

1836
01:05:55,614 --> 01:05:57,114
- my... - Don't bet on your family.

1837
01:05:57,384 --> 01:05:59,914
- We got in enough trouble for that. - Have you?

1838
01:06:00,144 --> 01:06:03,044
That's how certain I am.

1839
01:06:03,314 --> 01:06:05,684
You humiliated me and invaded my private space.

1840
01:06:06,044 --> 01:06:07,244
It's your turn.

1841
01:06:07,614 --> 01:06:08,684
- Me? - Yes.

1842
01:06:08,744 --> 01:06:10,814
I'm sure you already know, but it's not me.

1843
01:06:11,444 --> 01:06:13,584
- Why isn't it you? - Because it's not me.

1844
01:06:13,614 --> 01:06:14,614
Goodness.

1845
01:06:14,684 --> 01:06:16,684
- It's not me. - Okay, that's enough.

1846
01:06:16,744 --> 01:06:19,114
I'll bet on my right arm,

1847
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:21,484
that humiliated Jae Seok and his bottom, that it isn't me.

1848
01:06:22,344 --> 01:06:23,914
(Even after hearing the closing arguments,)

1849
01:06:23,984 --> 01:06:28,444
(it's still difficult to predict the No Man's identity.)

1850
01:06:29,544 --> 01:06:31,044
- Make the right choice. - We made up our mind.

1851
01:06:31,114 --> 01:06:32,344
Have you made up your mind?

1852
01:06:32,414 --> 01:06:34,284
Then, we'll have each of you go in the booth...

1853
01:06:34,584 --> 01:06:37,644
and cast your vote. Flash your paper to the camera.

1854
01:06:39,114 --> 01:06:42,114
(If they make the wrong choice, they'll be mud-bombed.)

1855
01:06:43,184 --> 01:06:46,084
(Who's the No Man between these two?)

1856
01:06:48,744 --> 01:06:54,144
(Kwang Soo is the first to vote. Who will he choose?)

1857
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:56,514
(He chooses Jong Kook.)

1858
01:06:56,944 --> 01:07:00,014
Whenever he takes on these roles,

1859
01:07:00,184 --> 01:07:02,144
he says things like, "It's not me."

1860
01:07:02,314 --> 01:07:03,944
- Because it's not me. - Gosh.

1861
01:07:04,014 --> 01:07:05,484
- It's not me. - That's enough.

1862
01:07:05,544 --> 01:07:07,484
He always gets these roles.

1863
01:07:07,814 --> 01:07:09,084
So I'll pick him.

1864
01:07:12,214 --> 01:07:13,484
(Je Hoon also chooses Jong Kook.)

1865
01:07:13,544 --> 01:07:15,244
I had a hunch from the beginning.

1866
01:07:15,944 --> 01:07:19,214
I had a feeling it was Sung Kyun near the end.

1867
01:07:19,284 --> 01:07:21,144
In the closing arguments,

1868
01:07:21,284 --> 01:07:23,684
I was convinced that Sung Kyun is the No Man.

1869
01:07:24,844 --> 01:07:25,944
So I chose Sung Kyun.

1870
01:07:26,014 --> 01:07:27,214
(A Ra chooses Sung Kyun.)

1871
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,644
(Jong Kook and Sung Kyun each earned 2 votes so far.)

1872
01:07:31,484 --> 01:07:33,344
(Sung Kyun stares at A Ra.)

1873
01:07:33,414 --> 01:07:34,814
- Why are you looking at me? - You didn't pick me, did you?

1874
01:07:34,914 --> 01:07:36,084
- Sorry? - I'm not the No Man.

1875
01:07:36,314 --> 01:07:39,014
I am warning you. I am not the No Man.

1876
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:40,544
I'm really not.

1877
01:07:41,144 --> 01:07:42,584
I hope you didn't make the wrong choice.

1878
01:07:43,044 --> 01:07:45,614
- He's so sincere. - Why didn't you say that before?

1879
01:07:46,814 --> 01:07:48,744
I told you that I wasn't the No Man.

1880
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:50,414
- What? - I made up my mind.

1881
01:07:50,514 --> 01:07:51,814
Sung Kyun, you're amazing.

1882
01:07:52,284 --> 01:07:53,284
(He laughs in disbelief.)

1883
01:07:54,084 --> 01:07:56,484
- Sung Kyun is... - Gosh.

1884
01:07:56,544 --> 01:07:57,784
- Who is the No Man then? - Goodness.

1885
01:07:57,844 --> 01:07:59,044
(They both deny that they're the No Man.)

1886
01:07:59,684 --> 01:08:01,144
- We'll see. - Gosh.

1887
01:08:01,344 --> 01:08:02,814
- I am so confused now. - He's driving me crazy.

1888
01:08:02,884 --> 01:08:04,814
(They still don't have a clue.)

1889
01:08:06,384 --> 01:08:08,414
I knew it was Sung Kyun from the beginning.

1890
01:08:10,744 --> 01:08:15,814
They really confused me towards the end.

1891
01:08:15,884 --> 01:08:18,614
(The remaining members cast their votes.)

1892
01:08:18,914 --> 01:08:22,584
(Sung Kyun and Jong Kook also cast their votes.)

1893
01:08:22,654 --> 01:08:24,344
(The voting is complete.)

1894
01:08:24,444 --> 01:08:29,214
- I'll announce the results now. - Please.

1895
01:08:29,284 --> 01:08:32,714
(I really don't want to be mud-bombed.)

1896
01:08:33,584 --> 01:08:34,944
Sung Kyun got six votes.

1897
01:08:35,014 --> 01:08:36,944
(Sung Kyun received 6 votes.)

1898
01:08:37,014 --> 01:08:38,014
(Yelling)

1899
01:08:38,084 --> 01:08:40,014
And Jong Kook got four votes.

1900
01:08:40,154 --> 01:08:41,214
- Really? - Goodness!

1901
01:08:41,344 --> 01:08:44,284
(Sung Kyung received more than half of the votes.)

1902
01:08:44,344 --> 01:08:46,314
I told you so many times that I am not the No Man!

1903
01:08:46,344 --> 01:08:47,414
Are you really not the No Man?

1904
01:08:47,714 --> 01:08:49,744
(I can't believe this.)

1905
01:08:49,844 --> 01:08:51,084
- Gosh. - All right!

1906
01:08:51,154 --> 01:08:52,244
He's still pretending he's not the No Man.

1907
01:08:52,344 --> 01:08:55,944
- I'm really not. - If Sung Kyun is the No Man...

1908
01:08:56,014 --> 01:08:57,414
- Is it Jong Kook? - It's Jong Kook.

1909
01:08:57,484 --> 01:09:00,044
If Sung Kyun is the No Man, he will receive the penalty alone.

1910
01:09:00,344 --> 01:09:02,584
- Did you vote for Jong Kook? - If Sung Kyun is not the No Man,

1911
01:09:02,654 --> 01:09:05,044
everyone except Jong Kook will receive the penalty.

1912
01:09:05,114 --> 01:09:06,284
(Who will be the ones to get mud-bombed?)

1913
01:09:07,014 --> 01:09:08,344
(It's time to find out who the No Man is.)

1914
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:10,244
- We're all going to get mud-bombed. - No way.

1915
01:09:10,414 --> 01:09:11,684
- One. - I am sorry, Sung Kyun!

1916
01:09:11,744 --> 01:09:12,744
Please!

1917
01:09:12,814 --> 01:09:13,884
(I'm so sorry.)

1918
01:09:16,654 --> 01:09:17,814
Two.

1919
01:09:18,214 --> 01:09:20,084
(Please...)

1920
01:09:20,584 --> 01:09:21,814
Three!

1921
01:09:21,914 --> 01:09:23,684
(Who will get the mud bomb?)

1922
01:09:23,744 --> 01:09:26,044
(Wow!)

1923
01:09:26,114 --> 01:09:28,514
(That's unbelievable.)

1924
01:09:31,214 --> 01:09:34,584
(The mud pours endlessly.)

1925
01:09:34,684 --> 01:09:40,244
(Everyone except Jong Kook receives the penalty.)

1926
01:09:40,314 --> 01:09:42,514
(The No Man is Jong Kook!)

1927
01:09:43,044 --> 01:09:44,114
(I told you that it wasn't me.)

1928
01:09:44,184 --> 01:09:45,184
It's pouring down.

1929
01:09:45,244 --> 01:09:46,814
(Where have all the pretty and handsome people gone?)

1930
01:09:47,014 --> 01:09:48,084
- Gosh. - I can't believe this.

1931
01:09:48,154 --> 01:09:50,384
- You fools! - How could you not notice?

1932
01:09:50,684 --> 01:09:52,344
(They're all filthy.)

1933
01:09:53,444 --> 01:09:54,814
- Towards the end... - No.

1934
01:09:54,884 --> 01:09:57,314
- I changed my mind at the end. - Why did you stammer?

1935
01:09:57,514 --> 01:09:59,714
- Why didn't you listen to me? - You weren't convincing.

1936
01:09:59,884 --> 01:10:01,744
- You should've been more clear. - This is ridiculous.

1937
01:10:01,814 --> 01:10:03,184
- You guys... - Why weren't you more clear?

1938
01:10:03,244 --> 01:10:04,314
Jong Kook said...

1939
01:10:04,344 --> 01:10:05,544
It was hard for me to keep a straight face.

1940
01:10:05,614 --> 01:10:07,014
Towards the end, Jong Kook...

1941
01:10:07,584 --> 01:10:10,714
looked at Sung Kyun in disbelief. That's when I fell for it.

1942
01:10:10,784 --> 01:10:12,884
Me too. That's why I chose Sung Kyun.

1943
01:10:14,614 --> 01:10:16,084
Sung Kyun, you're amazing.

1944
01:10:16,484 --> 01:10:18,184
(I can't believe you, Jong Kook.)

1945
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:20,784
(Jong Kook was able to deceive everyone.)

1946
01:10:21,654 --> 01:10:24,584
The No Man is Jong Kook.

1947
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:26,184
(Jong Kook is the No Man.)

1948
01:10:26,444 --> 01:10:29,514
It was really hard for me to deceive all of you.

1949
01:10:29,714 --> 01:10:32,384
- It was a hard role to play. - I can't believe this.

1950
01:10:32,544 --> 01:10:34,514
- It wasn't easy. - I thought it was him.

1951
01:10:34,584 --> 01:10:35,684
I was going to write Jong Kook's name.

1952
01:10:35,944 --> 01:10:37,444
You guys kept convincing me that it wasn't him.

1953
01:10:37,514 --> 01:10:39,484
- I was fooled at the last minute. - Me too.

1954
01:10:39,544 --> 01:10:41,744
I voted for Sung Kyun because his closing argument was weak.

1955
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:45,044
It was my first time to appear on Running Man.

1956
01:10:45,244 --> 01:10:46,714
This is payback.

1957
01:10:47,184 --> 01:10:48,314
(This is payback.)

1958
01:10:49,244 --> 01:10:51,244
(He's angry.)

1959
01:10:51,314 --> 01:10:53,014
- Jong Kook is really angry. - You're in trouble now.

1960
01:10:53,084 --> 01:10:54,584
- He's really mad. - Are you okay?

1961
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:56,784
If I deserved this, I'd have nothing to say.

1962
01:10:56,884 --> 01:10:58,084
Why did you do that?

1963
01:10:58,744 --> 01:11:00,914
- I can't understand him. - Why did you do this to me?

1964
01:11:01,344 --> 01:11:03,514
I've had my fair share of being on variety shows,

1965
01:11:03,784 --> 01:11:06,084
but I don't get why Kwang Soo just did what he did.

1966
01:11:06,214 --> 01:11:07,744
Look at me. What is this?

1967
01:11:08,384 --> 01:11:09,444
What is this?

1968
01:11:09,514 --> 01:11:10,584
(You shouldn't have done that, Kwang Soo.)

1969
01:11:10,654 --> 01:11:11,714
What was that for?

1970
01:11:11,744 --> 01:11:13,844
It was fun though.

1971
01:11:13,914 --> 01:11:14,914
I'm getting angry.

1972
01:11:14,984 --> 01:11:19,344
(Thank You, A Ra, Je Hoon and Sung Kyun for joining us.)

1973
01:11:20,044 --> 01:11:22,444
(The Battle for the Centre has begun.)

1974
01:11:22,514 --> 01:11:23,914
(7 guests join the show to support the members.)

1975
01:11:23,984 --> 01:11:25,044
What happened?

1976
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,914
(In Young, Stephanie, Jin Young, Hyeon Gyeong, Zico, Su Jin, Bo Ah)

1977
01:11:27,184 --> 01:11:28,484
Standby.

1978
01:11:28,944 --> 01:11:30,414
Don't even think about being in the centre.

1979
01:11:30,484 --> 01:11:31,484
What are you doing?

1980
01:11:31,544 --> 01:11:32,944
Are you going to appear on television by yourself?

1981
01:11:33,014 --> 01:11:34,284
(The one who sits at the centre shall gain everything.)

1982
01:11:34,884 --> 01:11:36,184
Do you want to be the king?

1983
01:11:36,244 --> 01:11:37,784
(It's a fierce competition.)

1984
01:11:37,844 --> 01:11:39,284
- Ouch, that hurt. - I need to be in the spotlight.

1985
01:11:39,344 --> 01:11:40,344
(They fight for screen time.)

1986
01:11:40,584 --> 01:11:41,744
It'd be a good idea to change it.

1987
01:11:41,814 --> 01:11:42,914
(Who will win the Battle for the Centre?)

1988
01:11:46,314 --> 01:11:49,484
(Next Week's Special is Battle for the Centre.)
