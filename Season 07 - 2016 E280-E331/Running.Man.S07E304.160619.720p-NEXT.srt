1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,370
What's all this?

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,670
(We've invited beautiful actresses for this summer special.)

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:11,360
(Beautiful Queen Park Shin Hye)

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,510
Oh, my. Look at her.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,340
(Lovely Queen Lee Sung Kyoung)

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,340
(Soon, these three queens will compete fiercely.)

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,610
Previously on Running Man.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,430
(Last Week)

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,740
(Running Man vs Hunters)

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,810
(The 7 members became Preys last week.)

11
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:29,940
I need to get out of here.

12
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,060
(Mysterious Hunters...)

13
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,970
(and the Preys who failed to resist temptation...)

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,110
(A vault is hidden somewhere in Seoul.)

15
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,840
(Become the owner of 7,000 dollars!)

16
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,470
(The Hunters are after the Preys.)

17
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,610
(Experienced Running Man members vs the Special 4 Hunters)

18
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,230
Start the car now!

19
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,070
(Hunters' only goal is to catch the members.)

20
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,040
(Will the members obtain 7,000 dollars or will they be caught?)

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,110
No way.

22
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:02,520
(Four are arrested and the survivors haven't earned full hints yet.)

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,970
(There are only three Preys left.)

24
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:10,070
(Clever Haha, Speedy Kwang Soo and Talented Ji Hyo)

25
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,510
(Who will be the one to come out on top?)

26
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,380
Please get ready to be caught.

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,670
(6 hours since the run)

28
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:27,970
(Kwang Soo is on his way to meet Haha.)

29
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,840
(He hurriedly grabs a taxi.)

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,440
Hello. Please take me to the War Memorial.

31
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,670
(What?)

32
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,510
(Jin Woong is right next to Kwang Soo, looking for him.)

33
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,140
Look! It's Uncle Jin Woong!

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,110
(Goodness.)

35
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,470
Right, I'm old enough to be your uncle.

36
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,040
Kwang Soo, you're making this old man run after you like this.

37
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,770
He's right there.

38
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,840
(I can't get caught like this.)

39
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,940
Please.

40
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,350
(I can't get caught like this.)

41
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,680
He's right next to us.

42
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,440
- Kwang Soo.
 - Yes?

43
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,900
There's someone here...

44
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,990
who wants to talk to you. He has something to say.

45
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,240
- Who?
 - Talk to him.

46
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,780
Kwang Soo, this is Sung Ki.

47
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,540
Hello, Sir.

48
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,670
Kwang Soo.

49
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,410
(What will be the head Hunter's ultimatum to Kwang Soo?)

50
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,070
(Will he say that he'll catch Kwang Soo or save his life?)

51
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,570
- Hello, Sir.
 - Aren't you thirsty?

52
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,710
- I'm okay.
 - You must be hungry, too.

53
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:31,340
(Aren't you thirsty and hungry?)

54
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,860
(Is this an ultimatum?)

55
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,010
Yes, Sir.

56
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,280
Let's meet and have some cold beer together.

57
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,210
Well, Sir...

58
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,210
(Sung Ki's sweet-talking.)

59
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,420
Actually, I'm being chased at the moment.

60
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,810
I think...

61
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,940
you should prepare to get caught nicely.

62
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,170
- So let's call it a day quickly...
 - Okay.

63
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,640
and have some drinks together.

64
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,910
Sir, Haha is in Samgakji right now.

65
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,110
(Kwang Soo betrays Haha.)

66
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,670
He's having lunch in Samgakji.

67
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,470
Then, get ready to be caught heroically soon.

68
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,140
- Yes, Sir.
 - I'll count on you.

69
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,650
That was really nice.

70
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,230
- I think it will make him hesitate.
 - Right.

71
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,540
I'm sure he will hesitate.

72
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,170
(His eyes tremble in hesitation.)

73
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,470
(He starts running with contemplation.)

74
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,730
I'm in front of Changdeokgung.

75
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,740
Okay.

76
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,110
Good. I'm right next to Doldam-gil.

77
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,410
(Kwang Soo decides to meet Haha.)

78
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,470
I'm on my way to Haha now.

79
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,470
(He's on his way to meet Haha.)

80
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,110
He says he's nearby.

81
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,070
(Haha is on his way to Kwang Soo by taxi.)

82
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,060
- Hello.
 - Kwang Soo, I think...

83
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,310
Oh, there you are. I can see you.

84
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,910
Get in. Get in.

85
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,310
(He sees Kwang Soo and stops the taxi.)

86
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,310
Okay.

87
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,050
- Hey.
 - What should we do?

88
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,410
- Gosh.
 - This is driving me crazy.

89
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,720
It's so nice to see you again. I'm so exhausted right now.

90
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,370
If we go this way, we can catch him.

91
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,640
- Who?
 - Haha.

92
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,170
- Do you mean this way?
 - Yes.

93
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,680
- This building must be there.
 - There are cameras.

94
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,610
- Hold on, is it this way?
 - That way.

95
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,670
Let's go.

96
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,970
(Haha and Kwang Soo head to Daehangno for hints.)

97
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,170
We must watch out here.

98
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,730
We should go that way.

99
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,470
- Where?
 - Down that way.

100
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,740
(Ji Hyo arrives at Daehangno after obtaining hints at Ant Village.)

101
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,700
- Do you know where Art Council is?
 - It's not this way.

102
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,110
- Really?
 - You have to turn left.

103
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,140
Left?

104
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,470
- So are we not alone?
 - We're in trouble.

105
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,270
Ji Hyo, hurry up!

106
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,920
You called me, right?

107
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,770
Then one of us must be on the lookout.

108
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,670
Why don't you two go? I'll look out for you.

109
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,840
- Then I'll go with Kwang Soo.
 - Okay. Stand guard.

110
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,630
All right. Let's go find them.

111
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,740
I don't know where we're heading. But let's give it a shot.

112
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,540
Haha's at Marronnier Park now.

113
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,240
- So it's near Dongseong street.
 - Now...

114
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,040
I think we should go that way.

115
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,010
- We should...
 - We must hurry now.

116
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,940
Wow. They have surveillance cameras everywhere.

117
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,470
(Haha uses surveillance monitors for a perfect lookout.)

118
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,320
I think they found something. They're coming up.

119
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,620
Will they share the hints?

120
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,010
- They look the same.
 - Kwang Soo,

121
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,510
we have to find the differences in these pictures.

122
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,840
"Press the button next to the window."

123
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,030
Window? Where is it?

124
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,380
- Now, Haha is...
 - He's trying to survive.

125
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,710
not with them.

126
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,910
I think he's staking out.

127
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,260
- Do you mean Haha?
 - Yes, in Daehangno.

128
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,510
And Kwang Soo is with Ji Hyo.

129
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,610
Where are you, Haha?

130
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,640
Why are you two not coming up?

131
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,440
Haha, you have to open the door in the basement for us.

132
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,370
- Do I have to open the door?
 - Yes.

133
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,240
Ji Hyo, I have a bad feeling.

134
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,510
(I don't feel good about this.)

135
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,540
Oh, I found it.

136
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,670
One, two, three, four, five.

137
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,270
I need to find two more.

138
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,510
- This is driving me crazy.
 - There are so many people here.

139
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,140
The atmosphere's very strange here.

140
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,940
Haha.

141
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,240
Calm down, Ji Hyo. Take your time. You can do it.

142
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Haha,

143
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,710
- switch positions with Kwang Soo.
 - I think they're coming in.

144
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,740
What?

145
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,170
They're here?

146
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,810
Find it now, Ji Hyo!

147
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,280
I can't!

148
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,470
Find it!

149
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,310
I found it!

150
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,610
(Ji Hyo finally finds all the passwords.)

151
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,810
(Haha discovers something.)

152
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,870
(They're here.)

153
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,160
Gosh, they're here!

154
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,210
They are here!

155
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,270
They're here!

156
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,340
(Ji Hyo starts running away, leaving Kwang Soo behind.)

157
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,870
(Tall Kwang Soo tries to climb over the wall.)

158
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:16,240
(Will they be able to successfully escape from the Hunters?)

159
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,540
Go get them! Catch them!

160
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,210
Where are they? Where?

161
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,440
(They're running in the middle of Daehangno.)

162
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,150
(Haha, don't make this chase more complicated.)

163
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,840
(Jae Seok is running after Haha.)

164
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,110
- Jae Seok!
 - Come here.

165
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,960
(Jae Seok sucessfully corners Haha.)

166
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,310
(There's no way to escape.)

167
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,610
Gary, go catch Kwang Soo.

168
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,910
Kwang Soo, run!

169
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,110
Come here.

170
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,360
- There you are, Jin Woong.
 - Jin Woong, rip his name tag.

171
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,410
My goodness.

172
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,670
- There you are.
 - Hello, Jin Woong.

173
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,170
You're here, Jin Woong.

174
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,370
(Nice to meet you, Prey.)

175
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,070
(I got you, Haha.)

176
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,140
Rip his name tag off.

177
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,310
(Ripping)

178
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,840
Come over here, Haha.

179
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,240
Come here.

180
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,810
- Let's go catch Kwang Soo.
 - No way!

181
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:07,940
Haha, where's Kwang Soo?

182
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,930
(The Hunters are now after Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo.)

183
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,670
(Hunters arrest Haha.)

184
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,170
(Ji Hyo barely escapes the building with the password for the vault.)

185
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,770
Sit down. Let's talk first.

186
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,570
Let's sit down here.

187
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,570
We should...

188
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,040
(Ji Hyo obtained all the hints and the password.)

189
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,170
There's information here.

190
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,340
Yeonhui Hill was a battlefield of the Korean War.

191
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,340
There was a battle here. I found the information.

192
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,740
Ji Hyo!

193
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,310
(No one answers back in the silence.)

194
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,310
Ji Hyo.

195
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,970
(Quiet)

196
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:53,870
(He's nothing but a rat in a trap without others' help from outside.)

197
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,930
Haha.

198
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,410
(There's no one here, either.)

199
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,770
(Haha... Ji Hyo... Please, anyone...)

200
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,640
Let's be together until the end.

201
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,840
(Us three must survive and find the vault together.)

202
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,590
- Kwang Soo!
 - Ji Hyo!

203
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:18,410
(You're on your way to save me, right?)

204
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,070
(We're here for you.)

205
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,810
- Why did you do that?
 - Hello.

206
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,970
- Kwang Soo.
 - How do we open the door?

207
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,110
My goodness.

208
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,210
- How could you...
 - Hold on.

209
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,640
No way! Why are you here?

210
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,940
- You...
 - Wait.

211
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,610
- Sit down. Sit down.
 - Wait.

212
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,810
(Yul removes Kwang Soo's name tag.)

213
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,160
- Sit down.
 - No!

214
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,210
How could you do that to me?

215
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,410
Did you get Haha, too?

216
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,110
- We finally caught Kwang Soo.
 - Gosh, I was almost done!

217
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,760
- It was a long day, right?
 - Right.

218
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,810
You're so inconsiderate.

219
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,870
- You shouldn't do that.
 - Wait...

220
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,450
You shouldn't have done that to the taxi driver.

221
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,470
How could you?

222
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,510
I am sorry.

223
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,610
(We'd like to thank the taxi driver for driving him around.)

224
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,850
- Let's go catch Ji Hyo!
 - Did you not see her?

225
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,160
- Ji Hyo just went up!
 - Let's go.

226
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,210
- Let's get going.
 - Goodness.

227
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,550
(Let's go get Ji Hyo. She has all the hints.)

228
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,660
(Kwang soo is out, too. Ji Hyo is the only one left.)

229
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,840
(Ji Hyo heads to the vault.)

230
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,840
Sir, please go to Yeonhui Hill.

231
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,570
(Meanwhile, the Hunters are chasing after Ji Hyo.)

232
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,910
Ji Hyo is the only one who got the hint at Miari Ridge.

233
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,740
(They must catch Ji Hyo before she gets to the vault.)

234
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,540
- Ji Hyo is the most dangerous one.
 - It's her.

235
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,530
Look at this.

236
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,070
I just looked it up on the internet.

237
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:31,610
It says there's a Memorial monument of Hill 104 there.

238
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,040
Is this the right place?

239
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,910
(She arrives at Yeonhui Hill after almost 8 hours of running.)

240
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,010
Oh, I'm finally here.

241
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,380
This is the right place.

242
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,370
It says "Memorial monument of Hill 104".

243
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,540
(I should hurry.)

244
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,710
I found it.

245
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,240
(She finds the right place with the hints she obtained.)

246
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:48,810
What?

247
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,370
(She's about to garner 7,000 dollars.)

248
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,430
(The vault is right before her.)

249
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,510
(She has been running all day for this.)

250
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,990
(Will Ji Hyo be able to grab 7,000 dollars?)

251
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,440
- My goodness.
 - Well done so far.

252
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,910
(Hello. Nicely done, Ji Hyo.)

253
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,680
- Poor Ji Hyo.
 - How?

254
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,070
We waited for you for a long time.

255
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,310
- We waited the whole day.
 - I knew you'd be waiting here.

256
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,540
- What's that building? A hospital?
 - This man is on crutches.

257
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,970
Isn't it Marronnier Park?

258
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,370
- It's near Daehangno, isn't it?
 - Yes.

259
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,040
Somewhere related to the Korean War.

260
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,470
Isn't it Yeonhui Hill?

261
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,210
- It looks like it.
 - It really does.

262
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,270
This must be the place. Yeonhui Hill.

263
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,210
- Hello.
 - Have you found the place?

264
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,410
I just arrived at Miari Ridge. Oh, goodness.

265
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,770
They said we should go underneath Hangang Bridge.

266
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,000
All right. I saw it.

267
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,340
- It's 53.
 - The answer is 53.

268
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,710
- This is the building. Right there.
 - I think they're there.

269
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,330
We're at the right spot.

270
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,460
- My goodness! Jin Woong!
 - Where are you going?

271
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,710
Where are you going?

272
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,840
You're right! It's Hongje-dong.

273
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,170
Sorry, do you know Mr Kim Jae Pyung living in the village?

274
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,840
I found it. Memorial monument of Hill 104.

275
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,040
I found it.

276
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,610
- Isn't it referring to year 1953?
 - Isn't it 1907?

277
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,510
Did something special happen in 1907?

278
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,880
Look.

279
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,670
- It must have been in the 1950s.
 - Right.

280
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,470
- So it's 1953, in July.
 - In July.

281
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,410
- It's the Korean Armistice Day.
 - Yes. It's the Armistice Day.

282
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,810
- In 1953.
 - It's the Armistice Day.

283
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,470
(They successfully open the vault.)

284
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,040
It's my father's birthday, too.

285
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,270
What's inside?

286
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,110
- Look.
 - There's something inside.

287
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,910
- Are these for us? One each?
 - Yes.

288
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,970
- They're the Golden Badges.
 - Thank you.

289
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,270
- Thank you.
 - Congratulations.

290
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,310
The R mark in the centre is made of real gold.

291
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,510
- So the exterior is fake.
 - Yes. You can detach it, too.

292
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,170
I'll cut off the parts when I get back home.

293
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,450
At home?

294
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,160
You should keep it as a token of remembrance.

295
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,800
Anyway, thank you everyone for joining us today.

296
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,140
(We'd like to thank all of the guests for joining us.)

297
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,670
- It was tough.
 - Good job everyone.

298
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,870
Well done.

299
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,640
(There are 48 days left until the Rio 2016 Olympics.)

300
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,940
(Korea National Training Center)

301
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,270
- Well done.
 - It's summer already.

302
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,670
It's summer already. It's so hot.

303
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,370
- Did you see the preview for today?
 - Yes, I did.

304
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,570
- Shin Hye will join us today.
 - It came out in the preview.

305
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,040
- Call her by her full name.
 - You should do that, not me.

306
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,010
- I'll keep calling her comfortably.
 - Does everyone want to know...

307
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,540
- today's guest?
 - No, we've watched the preview.

308
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,510
He tried to court Sung Kyoung last time,

309
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,470
- but it didn't go well.
 - No, I didn't!

310
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,170
- He tried to.
 - We're like family now.

311
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,870
He approached Hyun Jin and Sung Kyoung last time.

312
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,710
- Yes. That's right.
 - You approached Hyun Jin as well.

313
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,830
- That's not true.
 - It's really strange though.

314
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,840
All the women who was approached by Kwang Soo and turned him down...

315
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,270
- become really famous.
 - That's right.

316
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,240
- That's so true.
 - It's not true!

317
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,440
- That's true.
 - Think of Hyun Jin.

318
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,210
- Sung Kyoung and I are friends!
 - That sounds reasonable.

319
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,210
- No way.
 - They all became stars.

320
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,270
- That's right.
 - Do you agree with me?

321
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,810
You should never go out with Kwang Soo.

322
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,510
Why is everyone doing this?

323
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,870
(Just have fun, but don't go out with him.)

324
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,530
I know everyone is curious to know about today's guests.

325
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,540
- We already know.
 - You revealed them all already.

326
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,610
So I'll introduce them now.

327
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,610
They are actually standing over there right now.

328
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,640
Who are they?

329
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,010
(Two handsome men approach them.)

330
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,800
- It's Gyun Sang.
 - From "Descendants of the Sun".

331
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,370
- Good to see you, Gyun Sang!
 - Welcome.

332
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,210
(Yoon Gyun Sang and Kim Min Seok)

333
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:29,040
(Yoon Gyun Sang acted in the drama "Six Flying Dragons".)

334
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,210
I'm Moo Hyul, a warrior!

335
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:37,370
(Kim Min Seok acted in the drama "Descendants of the Sun".)

336
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,310
Hello. My name is Gyun Sang...

337
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,140
and I'll be acting in the drama "Doctors". Good to see you.

338
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,710
Last time, he acted as a warrior named "Moo Hyul".

339
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:49,010
- In the drama "Six Flying Dragons".
 - Will you be a doctor this time?

340
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,410
Hello. I'm Min Seok. I'll be acting in "Doctors" as well.

341
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,040
Min Seok will play the role of Kwang Soo.

342
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,760
I'll introduce the queens who are joining us today.

343
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,540
(Finally, the queens are here.)

344
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:09,710
(Ji Hyo looks beautiful in a white dress today.)

345
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,310
(He's stunned.)

346
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,470
- Ji Hyo.
 - Ji Hyo looks...

347
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,440
really pretty in a dress like this.

348
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,470
She often dresses up properly like this.

349
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,870
Ji Hyo is dressed up today.

350
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,510
- My gosh. You're pretty.
 - You look Vietnamese.

351
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,770
- You look pretty today.
 - You're dressed up today.

352
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,470
- You look really pretty today.
 - Hello.

353
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,830
- Hi.
 - You look so pretty.

354
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,070
(They are surprised.)

355
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,470
Who's next?

356
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:32,670
(Who is the second queen?)

357
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,670
(She's so charming that you may fall in love with her at first sight.)

358
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,270
- Welcome.
 - She's Sung Kyoung.

359
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,870
(Lee Sung Kyoung)

360
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,510
She hasn't changed at all.

361
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,070
- She's the daughter of Running Man.
 - Right.

362
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,810
Everything went well for her after joining us last time.

363
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,140
Here comes the next queen.

364
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:58,070
(Wow. They can't help but exclaim.)

365
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,840
(Her smile is as bright as the sun.)

366
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,040
- Wow.
 - It's Shin Hye this time.

367
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,570
(Park Shin Hye)

368
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,210
- Hello.
 - The dancing machine is here.

369
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,240
Nice to see you, Shin Hye.

370
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,540
- Good to see you.
 - They are both here.

371
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,570
(He can't hide his smile.)

372
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,610
- They are pretty.
 - Wow. They are all..

373
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,710
- beautiful today.
 - Today, these women...

374
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,810
These queens will join us today. Park Shin Hye and Lee Sung Kyoung!

375
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,840
(They're today's two beautiful queens.)

376
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,040
Also,

377
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,340
Min Seok and Gyun Sang has also joined us!

378
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,240
(The queens' bodyguards, Min Seok and Gyun Sang)

379
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,810
- Wow, he's tall.
 - He really is.

380
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,540
Both of you look so handsome.

381
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,840
The title for today's race is "Oh, My Queen!".

382
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,040
A few minutes ago, the three queens...

383
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,010
picked one rose each...

384
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,940
to see which one of them is the real queen.

385
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,610
Only one of them is the real queen,

386
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,870
and the other two are fake queens.

387
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,190
Really?

388
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,310
The queen who wins the game in the end will receive a diamond tiara.

389
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,500
This is what the male members have to do today.

390
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,370
You need to find the real queen and make her victorious today.

391
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,700
I see.

392
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,580
A hint about the real queen will be revealed after each mission,

393
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,410
so you must gather the hints and decide in the end.

394
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,840
But if a fake queen wins the race,

395
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,010
you will be flogged.

396
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,510
- Goodness.
 - Flogged?

397
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,510
This is crazy.

398
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,410
You will receive a hint...

399
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,510
about who the real queen is at the end of each mission from now on.

400
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,490
- So watch them closely.
 - We got it.

401
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,090
First, we'll make three teams.

402
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,070
We must choose which queen we think is the real one.

403
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,670
- Can we change our decision later?
 - Let's begin.

404
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,040
- All right.
 - Let's go.

405
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,410
(They may find hints while the queens dance.)

406
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,100
How should I do this?

407
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,210
(The dance battle among the queens)

408
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,380
I'm not sure who it is yet.

409
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,240
(Let's begin, Queens!)

410
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,470
- Look.
 - I don't have any ideas yet.

411
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,210
I think Ji Hyo is the real queen.

412
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,440
- Do you think it's Ji Hyo? Really?
 - Yes, I think it's her.

413
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,780
- Ji Hyo? Is it really you?
 - We can change our decisions later.

414
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,840
- Really?
 - I feel like it's Ji Hyo.

415
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,510
- Can we really change our choices?
 - She's dancing really hard.

416
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,810
(They dance hard to attract more members to their team.)

417
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,070
(And this man seems so happy as well.)

418
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,610
Sung Kyoung dances well.

419
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,140
Look at Jae Seok's face. What's wrong with him?

420
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,940
- Hey, look.
 - He's really scary.

421
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,590
(Jae Seok is really excited.)

422
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,140
- He's so annoying.
 - He is.

423
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,440
(What was that dance move?)

424
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,270
We can't have too many people in a team.

425
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,120
- I feel like it's Ji Hyo.
 - I think so, too.

426
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,710
Ji Hyo is dancing really hard.

427
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,940
I really think it's her.

428
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,330
You must keep moving.

429
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:27,890
All right. In 5, 4, 3, 2...

430
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,010
How will it turn out?

431
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,540
One!

432
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,640
I really think it's Sung Kyoung.

433
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,710
All right.

434
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,130
(Ji Hyo)

435
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,940
One, two...

436
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,670
(Sung Kyoung, Shin Hye)

437
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,010
Three.

438
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,380
(Who did the men choose as the real queen?)

439
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,440
Three.

440
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,070
- Park Shin Hye!
 - Park Shin Hye!

441
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,880
- Park Shin Hye!
 - Lee Sung Kyoung!

442
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,710
- Lee Sung Kyoung!
 - Song Ji Hyo!

443
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,540
- Park Shin Hye!
 - Lee Sung Kyoung!

444
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,620
All right. You chose your teams.

445
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,640
Now, we will give you a hint about who the real queen is.

446
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,270
It's related to the dance battle we just had.

447
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,830
- A hint?
 - What does he mean?

448
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,910
- About their dances?
 - There must be a hint...

449
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,270
- about their dancing.
 - Among their dances.

450
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,360
The real queen was...

451
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,720
the last person who stopped dancing.

452
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,840
She was the last.

453
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,270
- Really?
 - No. Shin Hye was the last.

454
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,440
- I'm not so sure.
 - I didn't see them in the end.

455
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,910
- Wasn't Shin Hye the last?
 - You're right!

456
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:25,310
(You shouldn't let your guard down. Make good use of the given hints.)

457
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:32,540
(Ji Hyo, Sung Kyoung and Shin Hye. Who is the real queen?)

458
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,210
(Team Shin Hye, Team Sung Kyoung and Team Ji Hyo)

459
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,190
Queens, please get on a palanquin.

460
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,880
- Two members will carry it.
 - And one will fan her.

461
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,140
More importantly, there is a big difference in their height.

462
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,370
Have a sip, Your Highness.

463
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,710
- Don't hold me back.
 - Isn't that too much?

464
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,340
Doesn't it feel nice to be treated like this, Shin Hye?

465
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,310
- It feels nice.
 - It's nice.

466
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,440
- Can I have some strong wind?
 - Of course, you can.

467
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,060
(I can make it a lot stronger if you want.)

468
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,710
Is this how things will go today?

469
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,640
- Shall we go?
 - The tag says "Queen Sung Kyoung".

470
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,540
- She's "Queen Shin Hye".
 - If you take a letter out of here,

471
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,140
it will change the meaning completely.

472
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,470
- Hey, Shin Hye!
 - Shin Hye.

473
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,330
Go, Haha. I should've lost some weight before I came.

474
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,600
- How did people do all of this?
 - Do you feel cool, My Queen?

475
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,010
- Actually, it feels nice.
 - Please fan me, too.

476
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,410
It's nice to be able to fan Shin Hye.

477
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,570
- Anyway...
 - We're almost there.

478
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,640
(They arrive at an outdoor pool near the Training Center.)

479
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,880
- My goodness.
 - Should we run there?

480
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,070
- What is that?
 - I guess we need to run over that.

481
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,740
(The queens give sunscreen to the members.)

482
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,210
You're so kind.

483
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,940
You're kind. No wonder.

484
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,620
Put it on your ears.

485
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,440
You should put sunscreen on your nose and cheeks. Like this.

486
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
Put it behind your neck.

487
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,320
- You must put on sunscreen.
 - Your neck, too.

488
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,070
(Seok Jin rides a buoy to get to the centre of the pool.)

489
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,190
- Don't do it. Just don't.
 - Wait.

490
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,540
You must jump over to that side.

491
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,670
Don't! I'll just jump!

492
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,900
(Lifting)

493
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,210
(He falls into the water.)

494
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,570
(Seok Jin starts off by getting soaked.)

495
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,010
- Why did you do that?
 - Why?

496
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,210
This game is called "Carry Your Queen".

497
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,270
The guys from each team will piggyback the opponents' queens.

498
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,310
The opponent?

499
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,710
You'll piggyback the opponents' queens...

500
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:25,340
and run on the track. Then, you'll pass the queen to the next player.

501
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,970
It'll be a relay...

502
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,670
and you must finish the race before the other team to win.

503
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,250
(You must come in before the other team to win.)

504
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,880
And as you can see,

505
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,970
there are toy hammers and other tools on the side.

506
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:40,040
The queens can pick one and use it to disturb the other team members.

507
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,710
- I see.
 - That's what they were for.

508
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,340
(Team Ji Hyo moves on since they've already won a game.)

509
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,770
What's the white one?

510
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,880
(Running Man members are known for cheating.)

511
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,110
You can hit their faces.

512
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,610
This one's good, too.

513
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,340
This one is good, too.

514
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,310
The sprayer is the best.

515
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,710
You can spray it in their eyes.

516
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,240
Can I spray it in their noses?

517
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,670
- This is enough.
 - No, she needs something more.

518
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,530
Which team would be better for us?

519
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,440
(These rookies are scared.)

520
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,470
Ready!

521
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,040
- Let's get started.
 - Ready!

522
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,110
She's giving me an arm bar!

523
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:14,040
- What's this? She's already aiming.
 - Ready.

524
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,210
(The 2nd runners fight amongst themselves.)

525
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,270
(They have started their own game.)

526
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,610
Let's get ready, everybody.

527
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,410
(The 1st runners get ready.)

528
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,240
(We can't lose.)

529
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:30,380
(We must let our queen take the win.)

530
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,110
(This looks interesting.)

531
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,670
(These women are intense!)

532
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,210
(The game starts!)

533
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,010
(Spraying)

534
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,240
(Pouring)

535
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,710
(They start attacking as soon as the match starts.)

536
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,010
(Struggling)

537
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,410
(They fall into the water.)

538
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,270
(Queen Shin Hye's tactic works!)

539
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,340
(Nice one, Queen Shin Hye.)

540
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,340
(She shoots water into his nose...)

541
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,410
(and wriggles her feet.)

542
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,940
(Seok Jin collapses.)

543
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,170
(Kwang Soo is proud of her.)

544
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,570
(These queens are no joke.)

545
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,440
- Stand up.
 - Stand up!

546
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
(Shaking)

547
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,970
Why aren't you coming?

548
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,560
(He crawls instead of walking.)

549
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,940
(She draws on his face with a lipstick.)

550
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,740
(Is this a rodeo?)

551
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,940
Hey, hey. She's no joke.

552
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,840
- It must be difficult for them.
 - That's right.

553
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,370
(Seok Jin finally gets back up.)

554
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,340
That's cold. That's cold!

555
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,170
Lean back, Sung Kyoung.

556
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,640
Fall down, Sung Kyoung!

557
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,730
Hey!

558
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,810
- Hello.
 - Hey!

559
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,770
(They fall in.)

560
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,670
(She's driving him crazy.)

561
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,340
(Struggling)

562
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,470
- Gosh!
 - I'm so tired.

563
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,570
I'm so tired.

564
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,470
(He looks mad.)

565
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:44,840
Come back!

566
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,240
- Come back, Shin Hye.
 - Stop it!

567
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,240
- Come back.
 - Come back.

568
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,340
(I'm 50 and I miss my mum.)

569
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,540
- I know I look ugly right now.
 - Let's go!

570
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,970
(Shin Hye is slightly behind,)

571
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:03,470
(so she uses a wrestling move.)

572
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,940
She's too strong. She's fierce.

573
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,810
That's the par terre position.

574
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,270
- Isn't that too much?
 - Let's go.

575
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,410
You can't do that.

576
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,540
It's wrestling.

577
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,640
She's hanging onto him.

578
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,340
(The two queens make this a close match.)

579
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,410
(Seok Jin comes in first.)

580
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,240
- She's tired.
 - Let's go, Sung Kyoung.

581
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,840
What happened to your face, Haha?

582
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,740
(He can't stand being criticised about his face.)

583
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,160
This is too much.

584
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,440
(Gagging)

585
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,770
(The guys are exhausted.)

586
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,660
(I can't watch this.)

587
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,970
Hurry up, Sung Kyoung. Come closer.

588
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:36,030
(Seok Jin passes the baton to Jae Seok.)

589
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,280
I'll go fast.

590
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,930
(She starts attacking him nonetheless.)

591
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,470
(He goes fast into the water.)

592
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,710
She's no joke.

593
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,460
(Cheering)

594
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,140
This is not a party!

595
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,270
- Get on first.
 - I'm going to disturb you.

596
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,570
One, two, three.

597
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,270
(Queen Shin Hye has a new weapon.)

598
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,710
(He tries to hurry.)

599
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,740
(He's actually balancing well.)

600
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,540
(The secret is in his skinny and long legs.)

601
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,470
I won't be responsible if you fall, okay?

602
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:06,070
(Kwang Soo's piggyback makes her dizzy.)

603
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:10,040
(She still rubs the glove against his face.)

604
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,540
(Shocked)

605
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

606
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,540
(It's just a rubber glove but it's powerful.)

607
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,940
- I can't see anything!
 - This stings.

608
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,240
Wow, Sung Kyoung is fierce.

609
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,570
(The two teams are quite close.)

610
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,140
(Queen Shin Hye dangles from his back.)

611
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,970
(He doesn't budge.)

612
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,310
Good job, Kwang Soo!

613
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,170
(He shows no mercy.)

614
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,170
(Open your mouth, Jae Seok.)

615
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,970
(I'll clean your teeth for you.)

616
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,810
They're both fierce.

617
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,010
(They're worried about who they'll get.)

618
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,140
You're almost done. Hurry up.

619
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,870
She's no joke.

620
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,010
Just go in the water!

621
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,510
(The rubber glove is the first attack.)

622
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,940
Are you trying to peel the squid?

623
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,040
(She prepares the squid...)

624
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,540
(and rinses it.)

625
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,270
- Hurry up.
 - My goodness.

626
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,340
(It's Jong Kook's turn.)

627
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,500
(He charges on.)

628
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,870
No!

629
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,740
(He's shocked.)

630
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,310
No! Fall in the water!

631
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,240
(She sways from side to side but he doesn't budge.)

632
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,240
(He overtakes the other team.)

633
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:22,510
Oh, wow. We're good.

634
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,110
You can do it!

635
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,970
(Are you sure?)

636
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:31,870
(She's fast.)

637
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,640
(He's done.)

638
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,470
Oh, dear.

639
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,840
My eyebrows are gone.

640
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:45,110
Gary, you're almost there! Hang in there!

641
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,440
(Queen Shin Hye and Jong Kook are too strong.)

642
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,770
(Now, it's all up to Sung Kyoung.)

643
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,740
No! No way!

644
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,010
I'm scared!

645
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,140
(They fall in.)

646
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,070
(He's more scared of her.)

647
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,700
(Sung Kyoung's splashing performance starts now.)

648
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,540
(Splashing to the left)

649
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,710
(Splashing to the right)

650
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,410
(She's incredible.)

651
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,970
(This is it!)

652
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,340
(Thanks to Sung Kyoung, the gap narrows.)

653
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,110
Hurry up. Hurry!

654
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,270
- Good job.
 - Stop it!

655
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:25,510
(Gary surpasses Jong Kook.)

656
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,540
Shin Hye!

657
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,440
(Queen Shin Hye's attack doesn't make him flinch.)

658
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:33,370
(Meanwhile, Queen Sung Kyoung attacks Jong Kook.)

659
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,210
(And she succeeds.)

660
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,270
(Thanks to Queen Sung Kyoung,)

661
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,740
(Gary crosses the finish line.)

662
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,210
(Team Sung Kyoung wins the first round.)

663
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,240
(They owe it to Sung Kyoung.)

664
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,310
I don't know what you're talking about.

665
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,570
I lost but I feel good about it.

666
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,710
Wait, we have to do another round.

667
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,540
We have to do another round.

668
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,240
They have another round to go.

669
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,470
It's our turn now.

670
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,710
What's more tragic is that we'll be facing Ji Hyo.

671
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,240
Try your best.

672
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,110
Try piggybacking Ji Hyo.

673
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,770
(She's the real deal.)

674
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,240
She's very fierce.

675
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,340
(Wait for me, guys.)

676
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,240
Team Ji Hyo has only 2 guys so you have to pick 2 as well.

677
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,640
- Okay!
 - Okay!

678
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,270
- Let's do rock, paper, scissors.
 - All right, brothers.

679
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,040
(They're too tired to be nice.)

680
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,470
- Rock, paper, scissors!
 - Rock, paper, scissors!

681
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:21,910
(Haha wins.)

682
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:22,970
Okay!

683
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,070
(He's angry and resentful.)

684
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,470
(Haha always gets lucky.)

685
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,140
(Team Sung Kyoung advances to the final round!)

686
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,240
Let's go, Ji Hyo!

687
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,240
(Team Sung Kyoung vs Team Ji Hyo)

688
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,520
- Let's go!
 - Let's go!

689
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,410
Look at her. Look.

690
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,070
(Ji Hyo loads herself with clothespins.)

691
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,170
(She plans to clip them all over their faces.)

692
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,160
Look how cruel she is.

693
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,910
Is she trying to exfoliate me with the scrubber?

694
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,240
(Sung Kyoung takes a scrubber.)

695
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,920
(Gary and Min Seok are good to go.)

696
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,170
Get on their backs.

697
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,110
Why has Ji Hyo gotten so light?

698
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,540
She's so light now.

699
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,940
This reminds me of the old days.

700
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:09,240
("Carry Your Queen")

701
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,340
(The final round begins!)

702
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,270
(Queen Sung Kyoung pours ice as soon as they start.)

703
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,540
(Squeezing)

704
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,740
(Queen Ji Hyo represses Gary by putting her legs around him.)

705
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,370
Wait!

706
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,240
(Ji Hyo is unbelievable.)

707
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,810
Ji Hyo is unbelievable. He can't even start.

708
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,310
(Queen Sung Kyoung takes out her scrubber.)

709
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,140
She's exfoliating me!

710
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,770
(Scrubbing)

711
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,140
That must hurt.

712
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,360
That's too much.

713
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,710
- He didn't even soak his skin.
 - Look at Sung Kyoung.

714
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,410
(He can't stand the pain...)

715
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,840
(and enters the water.)

716
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,970
(Meanwhile, Queen Ji Hyo...)

717
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,040
(clips Gary with clothespins and gives him a makeover.)

718
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,510
This hurts so much!

719
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,940
Come on, Ji Hyo!

720
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,110
This is so annoying! Ouch, my legs!

721
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:02,010
(His legs are about to give out.)

722
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,470
I'm going to cry!

723
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,070
I'm so tired!

724
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:13,570
(It's been a while, right?)

725
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,040
(I'm just happy to see you again, that's all.)

726
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,170
(This is a couple's synchronised swimming.)

727
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,640
(Title: Mermaid and the Ugly E.T.)

728
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,720
- She's strangling him.
 - She's no joke.

729
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,010
- She's unbelievable.
 - Ji Hyo is unbelievable.

730
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,010
Take these off now! Take these off!

731
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,910
(It wakes him up.)

732
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,970
I feel so lucky we didn't move onto the finals.

733
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,710
- I'm so thankful.
 - It's a relief.

734
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,540
Ji Hyo is too strong.

735
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,570
Come here.

736
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,510
Gary, they're far ahead of you!

737
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,570
Hey, Kwang Soo.

738
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,040
(All right, I'm on my way.)

739
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,970
(Where do you think you're going?)

740
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,240
Hey, stop!

741
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,900
(Her lethal move is wrapping her legs around him.)

742
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,240
Come on!

743
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,610
You won't know unless you experience it.

744
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,940
(But this was just the beginning.)

745
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,570
(She hits his throat at full speed.)

746
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,010
(She wrings him tightly with her legs.)

747
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,240
- Come on!
 - My legs!

748
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,670
Think of something else!

749
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,940
What's that?

750
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,570
Bear it, Gary! You can do it!

751
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,310
This is too cruel! I can't watch it any more!

752
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:23,370
- She is cruel. She really is.
 - This is crazy.

753
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,520
Ji Hyo, you never disappoint us.

754
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,340
Ji Hyo is impossible. She's impossible.

755
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,570
No...

756
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,310
(They go from a couple to this. What is your limit, Ji Hyo?)

757
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,140
(Thanks to Ji Hyo's interception, Gary arrives late.)

758
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,340
You're here! You're here! Okay!

759
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,340
Kwang Soo, you're in trouble now!

760
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,470
She lost a lot of her energy. She's weaker now.

761
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,840
Her entire body is a weapon.

762
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:51,640
(Ji Hyo holds him tightly.)

763
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,480
(Kwang Soo falters.)

764
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,570
I wasn't trying to be funny! I wasn't!

765
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,570
It's impossible to move!

766
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,270
(While Kwang Soo kneels down,)

767
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,570
What's this?

768
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,610
(Gyun Sang sprints.)

769
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,940
What's this?

770
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,210
(But not for long.)

771
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,010
- That's good! You went far.
 - I don't know how I did it.

772
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,870
(His plan is to go as far as he can since he will fall anyway.)

773
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,310
Good job, Gyun Sang! You went far!

774
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,210
(Kwang Soo tries again.)

775
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,810
Here we go.

776
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,610
(But he kneels once again.)

777
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,010
He is seriously not exaggerating.

778
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,210
- I was so shocked.
 - Ji Hyo is unbelievable.

779
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,340
Ji Hyo is unbelievable.

780
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:34,440
Stop her from wringing you!

781
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,740
(He collapses.)

782
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,940
(Power off)

783
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,140
How bad is she?

784
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,710
(How powerful is she?)

785
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,110
- That's great.
 - This is really crazy.

786
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,510
(Meanwhile, Gyun Sang...)

787
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,870
(throws himself in the water as planned.)

788
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,770
(Team Ji Hyo has the lead.)

789
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:58,940
Kwang Soo, you can stop her from tightening her legs!

790
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,040
(Kwang Soo, aims for her legs.)

791
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:06,770
(He attempts to stop her legs using his two hands.)

792
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:13,170
(Ji Hyo, forgive me...)

793
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:19,510
(for everything I've done wrong. I was wrong.)

794
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:25,840
(Flapping)

795
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,640
(It's no longer about competition, but about survival.)

796
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,870
Good job. She's doing well.

797
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:37,770
(With Ji Hyo's power and Gyun Sang's strategy,)

798
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:41,070
(Gyun Sang scores a goal.)

799
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:44,440
(They got both power and tactic. They show perfect team work.)

800
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,340
Goal!

801
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:51,140
Team Ji Hyo wins this round.

802
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,440
(Team Ji Hyo wins.)

803
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:57,310
I want everyone to experience this so that...

804
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:00,170
- you know I am not lying.
 - You can't walk.

805
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,210
You really can't walk.

806
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,010
Here we go.

807
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,440
- You collapse automatically.
 - I am not lying.

808
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,670
- You just collapse.
 - My back problem got fixed.

809
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,410
- Come here.
 - She corrected my spine!

810
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,940
- My cold is cured.
 - Come here. Come on.

811
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,440
Min Seok, come here.

812
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,170
But why do I have to do this to my own team member?

813
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,470
- Why do I have to feel this?
 - Just experience it.

814
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,760
(He gasps in pain.)

815
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,370
Congratulations! You will instantly feel better!

816
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,130
I was right, wasn't I?

817
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,440
That's how it is.

818
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,570
- Why am I doing this to my team?
 - After I got it,

819
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,670
my eye sight improved.

820
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,040
I see better now.

821
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,140
(Is this how variety shows works?)

822
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,690
- Here's the hint.
 - Okay.

823
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,670
In the "Carry Your Queen"...

824
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:45,970
We have to get this one.

825
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,540
On average, the person who dived...

826
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,340
into the water the most is the real queen.

827
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,310
- The name is...
 - Ji Hyo didn't dive much.

828
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,040
(Is it Ji Hyo?)

829
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,370
(A while ago, Ji Hyo showed an unbelievable skill.)

830
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,810
(It looks like she fell into the water many times.)

831
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,570
(They cannot remember.)

832
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:08,810
- Didn't she stay in the water?
 - Isn't it Sung Kyoung?

833
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,840
Sung Kyoung fell in the water a lot.

834
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,110
- Yes. I am the real queen.
 - It's not Ji Hyo.

835
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:16,940
I fell on my face so many times that it hurts.

836
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,010
(Who is the real queen?)

837
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:24,970
(The members get into their queens' cars.)

838
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,570
Something happened at home.

839
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:31,640
I was on the 007 special the other time, right?

840
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,280
At the time, I won a Golden Badge, right?

841
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,440
But a thief broke into my place.

842
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:39,780
- Really.
 - Really?

843
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,050
- Did he take the badge?
 - He took it.

844
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,940
He only took the gold that was attached to it.

845
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,940
How did he know about it? He must be a fan of Running Man.

846
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,840
He must've watched the episode.

847
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,910
- You have to be careful.
 - So today,

848
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:53,970
- I have to make sure to get one.
 - You have to get one.

849
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:55,600
You should win the gold today.

850
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,010
- There's a reason why I'm the one.
 - That's why you are the real one.

851
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,670
By the way, that team must be very quiet.

852
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,300
- Which one?
 - The one in the front.

853
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,500
- Oh, goodness.
 - What will they do?

854
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,440
- They will just stay quiet.
 - They'll only be breathing.

855
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,910
(Silent)

856
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:18,910
(Nobody is speaking.)

857
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:24,240
We have to use our brains and win today.

858
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:28,240
Otherwise, you will be flogged.

859
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,280
(Why would you break their spirits?)

860
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,510
Getting flogged on your first variety show...

861
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,510
is too sad.

862
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,710
- They only hit men, right?
 - Yes.

863
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:41,140
But when you get flogged, it will become a memory.

864
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:45,210
Good or not, you will have a memory of what a variety show is about.

865
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,910
(It becomes quiet again.)

866
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,840
(We are worried about these rookies.)

867
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,670
When I drive, I have to put on some music.

868
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,470
Let's sing. What song should we sing?

869
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,930
A rap song.

870
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,340
You go first.

871
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:02,070
- All eyes on me, my soul is free
 - She's actually doing it.

872
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,780
Other girls feel insecure because of me

873
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,810
They won't talk until I apologise

874
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,500
- Gosh.
 - Aren't I good?

875
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,340
- That's not it.
 - Wait.

876
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,010
- It's not that we didn't like it.
 - It's not that.

877
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,610
Concentrate! Listen! Look at me and listen!

878
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:18,310
- It gave me goosebumps.
 - You were too serious.

879
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,780
- Kwang Soo...
 - He interrupts my groove.

880
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,350
We don't get along well.

881
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,570
You always make me like that.

882
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,440
- What is this?
 - It's a track.

883
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,670
Get off, get off.

884
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,100
- What is it?
 - One, two, three.

885
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,740
Look at that.

886
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,740
(There is a huge structure.)

887
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,910
(What kind of mission will they carry out here?)

888
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,420
The second mission is "Queen Olympics".

889
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,450
We invited one more special queen.

890
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,860
There's another?

891
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,170
- Taekwon Girl.
 - It's her.

892
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,670
She's athlete Kim So Hee.

893
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,030
It's Kim So Hee.

894
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,310
(She will be joining the Rio 2016 Olympics.)

895
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,510
(She's got a small physique, but she has sharp kicks.)

896
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,330
She succeeds to hit the head!

897
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,420
(She is the gold medalist of the 2014 Asian Games.)

898
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,780
- She appeared like a comet.
 - Awesome.

899
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,970
(The Taekwondo queen visits Running Man!)

900
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,870
- Taekwon!
 - She must be busy.

901
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:08,970
- Taekwon!
 - It's an honour.

902
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,240
- Taekwon!
 - Kim So Hee.

903
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,340
I love Taekwondo, too.

904
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,470
She's black belt.

905
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,480
Preparing for Rio 2016 Summer Olympics,

906
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,470
she must be very busy right now.

907
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,370
The mission rule is simple.

908
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,280
So Hee will kick and smash...

909
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,890
- This?
 - styrofoam boards.

910
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,340
Shin Hye is really good at kicking.

911
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:31,010
One queen and one representative male member from each team...

912
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,710
- Gosh...
 - must beat So Hee's record.

913
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,640
The winning team will get the hint.

914
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:38,780
- Jong Kook.
 - Go, Jong Kook.

915
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,310
- But...
 - He has a third degree black belt.

916
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,170
- But that's...
 - Gary has eight degrees in total.

917
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,600
- But a tall person...
 - He's the master of fighting.

918
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,870
Short people can't do this.

919
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,810
Have you ever done Taekwondo?

920
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,940
- Never.
 - His nickname is Eiffel Tower.

921
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,940
- Why?
 - He can't split his legs far.

922
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,570
Is that true?

923
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,910
(His legs make a perfect A-shape.)

924
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,670
- Is that right?
 - But he's Moo Hyul.

925
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:01,440
- His nickname is Eiffel Tower?
 - But he's Moo Hyul.

926
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,470
- But Moo Hyul doesn't kick.
 - It's advantageous for us.

927
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,740
Moo Hyul doesn't kick!

928
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,310
- Moo Hyul doesn't kick.
 - He only uses a sword.

929
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,440
But Shin Hye is very flexible.

930
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,340
- Being flexible beats everything.
 - She's the best.

931
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,390
Anyway, the male representatives will play against the queens.

932
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:18,110
So Hee will first show us how it is done.

933
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,240
- Yes.
 - Please welcome So Hee.

934
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,610
- It's an honour to see your kicks.
 - Don't hurt yourself.

935
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,110
- She can kick high.
 - She can.

936
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,040
- She can kick high.
 - She can.

937
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,780
(She can kick at a 180-degree angle.)

938
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,370
- Do I have to just kick?
 - You know what will be...

939
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,630
more honourable? You have to get hit by her kick.

940
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,910
Do you want to try it?

941
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,970
- Seok Jin will try.
 - I will do it.

942
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,340
You have to put something on his head.

943
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,920
- Like that.
 - Oh, gosh.

944
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,070
It's scary.

945
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,540
- You're good at aiming, right?
 - Yes.

946
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,510
- Please do well.
 - Please.

947
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,040
Maybe she will kick his nose and his nose will fly off.

948
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,570
(That was a perfect kick.)

949
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:53,470
(This glorious high-kick overwhelms Seok Jin.)

950
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,110
- She makes it look easy.
 - It's really scary.

951
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,370
Like this.

952
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,140
- She's truly amazing.
 - It's really scary.

953
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,470
- So Hee.
 - You can use any form you want.

954
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,310
- Just relax and do it.
 - Come on!

955
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,040
You can do it!

956
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,170
(Her glorious kick will lead Rio 2016 Olympics.)

957
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,470
(She has charisma.)

958
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,570
The boards got ripped.

959
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:13,840
19.

960
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,740
- 19.
 - She kicked 19 of them.

961
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,810
19.

962
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,780
She's not a tall person, yet...

963
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,510
- Her kick was almost straight.
 - I know.

964
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,870
- Kwang Soo can...
 - Now, the team that breaks...

965
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:28,940
more than 20 boards will win.

966
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,440
Which team will go first? Queen Sung Kyoung!

967
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,070
She's very tall, so we have an advantage.

968
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:38,340
Because she's tall, she can kick more boards.

969
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,300
(Shall I give it a go?)

970
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,540
Cheer her on, please.

971
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,730
Sung Kyoung has fair skin, too.

972
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:46,370
- It's the same when I'm tanned.
 - She doesn't get a tan easily.

973
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,780
- How do you know that?
 - This is me being tanned.

974
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,470
- Is that right?
 - We're close friends.

975
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,370
How do you know so well?

976
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,970
- How do you know so well?
 - It doesn't make sense.

977
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,780
- How would he know that?
 - How do you know that?

978
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,310
I've known her for a long time.

979
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,430
Sung Kyoung is ignoring us.

980
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,700
(She doesn't mind them.)

981
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,780
Sung Kyoung is ignoring us.

982
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,070
(Oh my goodness!)

983
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,140
- Sung Kyoung, that's great!
 - That...

984
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,600
was really high! You reached 20.

985
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,810
She has really long legs.

986
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:09,940
(At this rate, they'll be able to succeed.)

987
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,310
- You can do it!
 - Can I get the tiara?

988
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,240
- You can get the tiara.
 - Lee Sung Kyoung!

989
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,610
(Go for it, Sung Kyoung!)

990
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,160
- Get ready.
 - Go for it!

991
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,620
Try to stretch your leg as high as possible.

992
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,470
- Raise your leg high!
 - You can do it.

993
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,670
(Queen Sung Kyoung breaks 18 boards.)

994
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,780
You broke 18 of them.

995
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:30,470
- I was so close.
 - You did a good job.

996
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,870
- You're strong.
 - You did great.

997
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,940
- She broke 18 boards.
 - Okay.

998
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,210
- Queen Ji Hyo!
 - Queen Ji Hyo!

999
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,310
I think she'll break a lot.

1000
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,120
(Why am I worried about this?)

1001
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,490
Just think that's Kwang Soo.

1002
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:42,640
Get ready.

1003
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,940
(Let's do this as usual.)

1004
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,810
(Ji Hyo often kicked Kwang Soo very well.)

1005
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,570
(Here goes Queen Ji Hyo!)

1006
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,970
(She kicks the boards.)

1007
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:58,710
(Many boards are broken.)

1008
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,670
- She broke 13 of them.
 - She is...

1009
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,170
- No, she broke 11 boards.
 - It's 11.

1010
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,840
Finally, it's Queen Shin Hye's turn!

1011
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,150
(It's Queen Shin Hye's turn.)

1012
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,410
Queen Shin Hye!

1013
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:09,510
- I think she'll succeed.
 - Really.

1014
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,640
- She's competitive.
 - Then...

1015
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,270
- She's good at this.
 - Director!

1016
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,800
Gosh, I feel so pressured.

1017
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,980
- I feel like I must win.
 - You must.

1018
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,840
- Since you're flexible.
 - Of course.

1019
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,560
She has a flexible body.

1020
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,780
But she also has a dogged determination.

1021
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,670
(She has a dogged determination.)

1022
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,710
And...

1023
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:27,410
No, please stop. It's my first time here in two years.

1024
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:30,310
(We'll see how dogged she is.)

1025
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:34,750
- Don't be nervous, Shin Hye.
 - Show us how strong you are.

1026
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,470
(She looks determined.)

1027
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,470
(She has a firm stance.)

1028
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,510
(She breaks the boards.)

1029
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,530
Wow!

1030
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:46,940
(She breaks 19 boards.)

1031
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,670
She also made a scratch on the 20th board.

1032
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,870
- She really did.
 - That's amazing.

1033
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:54,240
Gosh, you were so close to it.

1034
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,810
- I was so close.
 - Right.

1035
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,110
All right.

1036
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:01,290
The queens have competed fiercely.

1037
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:03,810
- It's the guys' turn now.
 - Okay.

1038
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:07,210
We have many tall members.

1039
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,610
- You can do it!
 - Go for it!

1040
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,470
(Gary goes first.)

1041
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:11,610
Go, Gary.

1042
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,540
(What a powerful kick!)

1043
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,870
(Gary breaks 22 boards!)

1044
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,210
(That's unbelievable!)

1045
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:24,170
(Thanks to Gary, Team Sung Kyoung completes the mission.)

1046
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,900
That was amazing.

1047
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,240
It's Jong Kook's turn!

1048
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,110
(Jong Kook gives it a try.)

1049
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,510
(He breaks 21 boards and his team also succeeds.)

1050
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,340
(It's all up to Gyun Sang now.)

1051
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,820
It's Gyun Sang's turn now.

1052
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,780
His nickname is Eiffel Tower. Gyun Sang!

1053
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,780
(It's Gyun Sang's turn.)

1054
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,230
- He's really tall.
 - But...

1055
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,610
his body is a bit stiff.

1056
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:45,740
He can do it because he's tall.

1057
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:48,940
(Will this stiff guy be able to break the boards?)

1058
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,480
Warrior Moo Hyul!

1059
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,970
Break more than 23 boards!

1060
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,610
- What was that?
 - 23?

1061
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,870
- What did she say?
 - Surpass 23.

1062
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,960
- I'll carry out the mission...
 - What is she doing?

1063
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,140
without any mistakes.

1064
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,340
I'll start.

1065
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,810
(Start)

1066
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,440
Warrior Moo Hyul!

1067
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,340
I'll carry out the mission without any mistakes.

1068
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:17,840
(I'll do my best...)

1069
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,670
(with all my heart.)

1070
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:21,740
(Breaking)

1071
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,610
It's broken!

1072
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:26,870
(His performance is a bit disappointing.)

1073
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,740
(Laughing)

1074
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,220
- He made it!
 - He reached the 20th board.

1075
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,830
- It's 20!
 - It's 20.

1076
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:36,940
- He cleared the mission!
 - Good job.

1077
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:41,170
(Gyun Sang, Gary and Jong Kook broke 20, 22 and 21 boards respectively.)

1078
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:43,040
All three teams...

1079
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,500
cleared the mission.

1080
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,340
So we'll tell all of you what the real queen did as a hint.

1081
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:57,070
(They get closer to finding out who the real queen is.)

1082
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:59,510
(Who is the real queen?)

1083
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:02,830
(The real queen held hands with one of her team members.)

1084
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,510
The real queen held hands with her team member?

1085
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,710
When did she do that?

1086
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,070
I can't remember.

1087
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:08,710
No. Didn't she hold...

1088
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:10,440
someone's hand when she lifted her leg?

1089
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:12,370
Does it have to be a hand exactly?

1090
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:13,970
- Isn't it Shin Hye?
 - Hands and arms are different.

1091
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:16,210
Please tell us exactly. Can it be an arm instead of a hand?

1092
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:17,610
- This counts, too.
 - The shoulder?

1093
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,240
Please tell us exactly.

1094
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,610
- But...
 - We need to make this clear.

1095
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:25,240
It was great to have So Hee with us.

1096
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,820
But we'll be even more happy to see you again on television.

1097
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,170
We'll root for you, So Hee.

1098
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:31,540
Please take care and do your best in the Olympics.

1099
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,770
(The Rio 2016 Olympics will be held this summer.)

1100
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,110
(The Korean players will do their best and we'll root for you all.)

1101
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,300
Please don't get hurt.

1102
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,010
- It's okay if you don't get medals.
 - Right.

1103
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,440
But please do your best there.

1104
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,810
- We'll root for you.
 - He's right.

1105
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:46,170
Don't forget that we'll be rooting for you in Korea.

1106
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:51,030
- Did you hold a guy's hand?
 - I did.

1107
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,170
- I think...
 - I did.

1108
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:54,010
- Shin Hye held a guy's hand.
 - Right.

1109
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:56,210
I might be the real queen.

1110
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:58,130
- But they said she held hands.
 - Right.

1111
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,570
I remember that I grabbed your arm like this.

1112
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:04,470
Min Seok hopes that I'm the real queen.

1113
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:05,710
So he asked if this part can be regarded as a hand.

1114
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:07,920
Didn't you?

1115
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,740
I think it's not you, Sung Kyoung.

1116
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,970
Do you think so? Then leave me. You won't get the diamond.

1117
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:14,610
I'm confident that I'm the real queen.

1118
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:17,070
If you are, I think you would've tried to persuade me more.

1119
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:19,210
Why should I? Don't you think I was born to be the queen?

1120
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,010
Can't you feel how confident I am?

1121
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:23,740
Can't you?

1122
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:26,710
Are you smart or dumb?

1123
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:28,840
I'm telling you the truth.

1124
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,010
(Sung Kyoung is too confident.)

1125
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,750
It's okay. Leave us, then.

1126
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:32,810
- You're good.
 - Of course, I am.

1127
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:33,970
- She is.
 - Great.

1128
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,360
You should show me some reaction.

1129
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,640
(They head to the next mission.)

1130
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:39,610
(S University in Gongreung-dong, Seoul)

1131
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:41,930
Gosh, it's really confusing. Who's the real queen?

1132
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:43,710
Just believe me. Trust me.

1133
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:44,970
- Okay.
 - Shin Hye.

1134
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:46,770
- You're our queen.
 - We'll believe you.

1135
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:47,810
See you.

1136
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:48,870
(The three queens head somewhere.)

1137
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:50,310
Are you going to separate us?

1138
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:54,470
(The three queens are isolated in different rooms.)

1139
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:55,470
What's going on?

1140
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,110
It's time to make a final choice.

1141
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:01,650
(A final choice?)

1142
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:04,840
Here is The Decision Room.

1143
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:08,230
Find your team's queen and go into the room.

1144
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:10,710
Change into the team uniform of the one...

1145
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:13,210
who you think is the real queen...

1146
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,340
and join her team.

1147
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:17,500
It's so confusing.

1148
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,690
I just need one more hint.

1149
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:21,370
What should we do?

1150
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:23,940
(Their choice might change their destiny.)

1151
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,550
(There were three hints about the real queen.)

1152
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,570
(Hint 1: The real queen danced until the end.)

1153
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:29,800
She danced until the end.

1154
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,070
(Is Sung Kyoung the real queen?)

1155
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:39,410
(Hint 2: The real queen fell into the water the most.)

1156
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:42,370
I fell face down into the water so many times that it hurts.

1157
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:43,970
(Is Shin Hye the real queen?)

1158
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:49,740
(Hint 3: The real queen held a guy's hand.)

1159
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:55,010
(Is Ji Hyo the real queen?)

1160
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:57,590
(Which one of them is the real queen?)

1161
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:59,010
I seriously don't know.

1162
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:00,710
(The male members enter the rooms.)

1163
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:02,070
(Will they stay loyal to their original queens?)

1164
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,670
Gosh, this is not easy.

1165
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:07,640
(Whom will they choose?)

1166
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,330
Park Soo Kwang!

1167
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:13,510
(Kwang Soo acted as Soo Kwang, Sung Kyoung's partner, in a drama.)

1168
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:16,110
If you're not the real queen, everything will become meaningless.

1169
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:17,360
It's you, right?

1170
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,570
(Kwang Soo chooses Sung Kyoung.)

1171
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:21,610
No. I'm almost done.

1172
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:23,140
(5 minutes ago, Kwang Soo thought about going to Shin Hye.)

1173
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:26,070
(But then he contemplated.)

1174
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,170
Yes, I'm done now.

1175
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:29,940
(He chose Sung Kyoung in the end.)

1176
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:32,910
(Kwang Soo didn't betray her.)

1177
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:34,010
I am the real one.

1178
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,470
- Are you?
 - I am.

1179
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:36,510
I thought so.

1180
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:37,570
- I'm the real one.
 - Good.

1181
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,440
(Who will come to Shin Hye's room?)

1182
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,170
(Jong Kook enters.)

1183
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,830
- Jong Kook.
 - Hi.

1184
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:47,010
I am so happy.

1185
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:48,780
What are you so happy about?

1186
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:49,910
Actually,

1187
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:52,170
- I'm the real queen.
 - I hesitated a bit.

1188
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,440
- But for now,
 - I'm the real queen.

1189
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,810
I chose you.

1190
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:57,210
- Jong Kook.
 - Yes?

1191
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,070
Wow, great.

1192
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:02,270
(Min Seok betrays Ji Hyo and joins Shin Hye's team.)

1193
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:06,270
(He betrayed Ji Hyo without hesitation.)

1194
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:08,240
Welcome.

1195
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:09,710
I really hope you're the real one.

1196
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:12,040
Of course, I am. Don't worry.

1197
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,740
I think Jae Seok will come here, too.

1198
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:14,840
Really?

1199
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:17,170
See? I told you.

1200
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:19,170
(Jae Seok also joins Shin Hye's team.)

1201
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:20,270
I told you.

1202
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:22,440
Oh, it's Gary.

1203
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:24,370
There's someone outside.

1204
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:25,870
Is everyone here?

1205
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:28,640
(Even Seok Jin joins.)

1206
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:30,410
Wow, Haha.

1207
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:32,470
Really?

1208
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,310
- Welcome to my room.
 - You danced until the end.

1209
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:36,310
She's a bit weird.

1210
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:38,440
She dances automatically when she hears music. She really does.

1211
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,770
(They said the real queen danced until the end.)

1212
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:41,140
- See?
 - It's true.

1213
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,980
That's plausible.

1214
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:44,010
She really does.

1215
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:45,340
(Haha believes that Sung Kyoung is the real queen.)

1216
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,140
- You're right.
 - She's the real one.

1217
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,610
(While Team Sung Kyoung is having a fun time,)

1218
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,540
(Ji Hyo's room is quiet.)

1219
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,610
(Sighing)

1220
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:55,310
What if no one comes?

1221
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:05,020
(But there's a gleam of hope for Ji Hyo.)

1222
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,740
(Oh, my Gyun Sang!)

1223
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:09,140
Gosh, you're the best.

1224
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,120
- I'll protect you.
 - Gosh, you're so reliable.

1225
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,440
Did you just hear that? He said he'll be with me.

1226
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,910
(Gyun Sang is Ji Hyo's only team member.)

1227
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:18,040
You're so reliable.

1228
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:23,070
(New teams have been formed.)

1229
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:25,640
(What will be the final mission?)

1230
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,610
The final mission is "Protect the Queen".

1231
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:30,810
"Protect the Queen"?

1232
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,410
(Protect your queen's name tag.)

1233
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:36,910
You must protect your queen's name tag...

1234
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:39,060
to become the final winner.

1235
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:42,470
Only queens are allowed to remove other queens' name tags.

1236
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,710
If your queen's name tag is removed,

1237
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,930
all the members in her team will be out as well.

1238
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:50,040
However, if the winning queen isn't the real one,

1239
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,140
all the male members will be flogged as a penalty.

1240
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:55,110
But if the queen turns out to be the real one...

1241
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:56,470
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

1242
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:59,640
The male members of the other two teams...

1243
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,540
will be flogged as the penalty.

1244
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:06,970
You'll find Betrayal Rooms within the building.

1245
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:09,210
(Betrayal Room?)

1246
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,840
(It's their last chance to change their minds.)

1247
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,970
Inside the room,

1248
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:20,240
there is the conclusive hint about the real queen.

1249
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:23,390
If, during the race,

1250
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:26,170
you start harbouring doubts about your queen,

1251
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:29,840
you can go to the Betrayal Room and change your mind.

1252
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,140
That's a possibility.

1253
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:35,320
However, once you enter the room,

1254
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,710
you must change your mind.

1255
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:40,070
If your choice is wrong,

1256
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:42,340
you'll be flogged double the original amount.

1257
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,360
It's double?

1258
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,360
(If their choice is not correct, they'll be flogged twice as much.)

1259
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:51,610
(There are three Betrayal Rooms and each can be used once only.)

1260
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:52,970
Why would you hit us?

1261
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,140
(The race starts in 5 seconds.)

1262
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,670
What do I do?

1263
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:58,670
Five, four,

1264
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:02,140
three, two, one. The race has begun.

1265
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,240
- Let's go!
 - Let's go!

1266
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,510
(Who is the real queen?)

1267
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:08,270
Let's be cool and stay here.

1268
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:10,070
- Let's make them betray each other.
 - That's a good idea.

1269
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:13,240
- You can stay here.
 - I'll...

1270
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,070
- hide here.
 - I'll stay here.

1271
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:17,410
Can I open this somehow?

1272
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,770
(Let's look for the real queen!)

1273
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:24,110
(The race starts now!)

1274
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:28,810
Gyun Sang, I feel so safe around you.

1275
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:30,060
Of course.

1276
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,600
I'll guard you using my entire body.

1277
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,310
(I will protect my queen!)

1278
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:36,610
Shin Hye, you'll win for sure with us around.

1279
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:37,810
There's five of us.

1280
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:39,370
We'll be fine as long as you don't betray us.

1281
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:40,770
I won't. I swear.

1282
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:43,170
- Let's eliminate the guys.
 - We should.

1283
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:47,010
We're going to outnumber them and attack them at once, right?

1284
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,970
Let's use our number to our advantage.

1285
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,740
Where could they be?

1286
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:53,640
- They must be hiding.
 - I'm definitely sure about that.

1287
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:56,370
(Eating)

1288
00:51:56,370 --> 00:52:01,270
(Team Sung Kyoung replenishes their energy while in hiding.)

1289
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:03,540
Let's take a selfie.

1290
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:06,540
(She's not ordinary for sure!)

1291
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:09,810
(Let's not betray each other and remember this moment.)

1292
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,910
- Are they not there?
 - Shall we split in half?

1293
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:14,040
Let's do that.

1294
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:16,810
Jong Kook, go this way.

1295
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:18,570
(They split in half for a more effective search.)

1296
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:20,530
- The three of us, then?
 - We can do that.

1297
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:22,240
This is a perfect combination.

1298
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,710
- If they...
 - I'm sorry for saying this.

1299
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:25,610
Would the three of you betray the rest of us?

1300
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,710
- Oh, come on.
 - Why would you say that?

1301
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:30,940
Look at this guy.

1302
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,840
- The three of you could do that.
 - No way.

1303
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,110
The three of you could each enter a Betrayal Room.

1304
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:38,010
You can do that as soon as you find the rooms.

1305
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:40,470
- That's nonsense.
 - That'll put us at a disadvantage.

1306
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:41,970
What are you talking about?

1307
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:43,410
- Don't say that.
 - Wait a minute.

1308
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,170
Let's see what happens if you betray us.

1309
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:48,870
- I won't.
 - I'll rip the skin off your backs.

1310
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:51,070
Watch me.

1311
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:53,570
Jong Kook, let's put these two in separate groups.

1312
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:57,010
Min Seok can go to this group. Stay with him.

1313
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:59,340
- That's a good idea.
 - I saw Seok Jin's face.

1314
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:02,070
- I can't trust them.
 - I know what you mean.

1315
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:06,060
Wait. I have a bad feeling about this.

1316
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:07,840
- Let's go, Jong Kook.
 - All right.

1317
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:09,770
- Hey.
 - Get rid of the guys.

1318
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,270
- Eliminate Gyun Sang immediately.
 - Okay.

1319
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:13,570
Ji Hyo is calling.

1320
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:16,070
- Yes, Ji Hyo.
 - Where are you?

1321
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:20,600
I'm by the Gifted Education Centre.

1322
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,440
I'll be there as soon as I can.

1323
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:24,770
You have to stay alive.

1324
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,610
It's this way. Come this way, Gary.

1325
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:31,770
(They're nervous.)

1326
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:34,840
- Can we do it on our own?
 - We better bring the others.

1327
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,770
- Can we do it?
 - Let's bring them.

1328
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:37,770
Hold on.

1329
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,970
Seok Jin, come here. Come in.

1330
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:43,810
- Come inside.
 - Hurry up.

1331
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:45,340
- Why?
 - Don't go in.

1332
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:48,570
There's only room for three. Betray your team and join us.

1333
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,210
- She's the real one.
 - I swear.

1334
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:52,340
- I'm the queen.
 - She is. Come inside.

1335
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:55,040
- Are you the real queen?
 - I told you I was the real one.

1336
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,670
- She's being honest.
 - Are you sure?

1337
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:58,240
- You caught me.
 - She's being serious.

1338
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,340
There's room for three, so betray them.

1339
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:03,940
(Is it Shin Hye or Sung Kyoung? That is the question.)

1340
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,440
(What will Seok Jin do?)

1341
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,110
- Team...
 - Betrayers. Cross!

1342
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:11,740
Isn't this too early in the game?

1343
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,440
I can tell that she's real.

1344
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,710
I'm being serious!

1345
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,310
I think I was dancing until the end.

1346
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:17,940
I was dancing until the music ended.

1347
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,470
- She'll start moving once you clap.
 - She's the real queen.

1348
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:22,570
(Is this strong enough of an evidence?)

1349
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:24,770
- I'm the real one.
 - This is driving me nuts.

1350
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:27,170
This is strange, but...

1351
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:28,870
I feel better after looking at Sung Kyoung.

1352
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:30,540
- Right?
 - I don't know why.

1353
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,110
- Go to the room.
 - You won't regret it.

1354
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:34,570
- There are only three rooms.
 - This is the third floor, right?

1355
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:36,170
- Text us.
 - There are only three.

1356
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:37,610
(Is Team Shin Hye swayed?)

1357
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:39,010
Oh, gosh.

1358
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,910
The real queen danced until the end.

1359
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:47,570
(Is Sung Kyoung the last one to stop dancing?)

1360
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:50,840
She fell into the water the most.

1361
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,110
(Did she fall in the most?)

1362
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:54,810
- She held hands with a male member?
 - She did?

1363
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:55,810
When did she do that?

1364
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:58,040
(Is Sung Kyoung the one who held a male member's hand?)

1365
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:01,510
(This moment of choice will change their destiny.)

1366
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:04,840
(Will they decide to betray their team?)

1367
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:08,840
I think we can talk them into entering the Betrayal Room.

1368
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,740
They'll go in for sure.

1369
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:15,070
- But we're done for if they see us.
 - I agree.

1370
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:19,410
(Is this the end for us?)

1371
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:23,640
Gyun Sang, you should...

1372
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:29,070
(Ji Hyo hesitates to speak.)

1373
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:30,140
I should what?

1374
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:32,140
(What's wrong, Ji Hyo?)

1375
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:33,610
Move to...

1376
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:37,440
another team...

1377
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,610
before the Rooms get used up.

1378
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:45,110
(Ji Hyo is being thoughtful because Gyun Sang is on his own.)

1379
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:47,310
To tell you the truth,

1380
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:50,170
I'm very happy that you came to me.

1381
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:55,670
But I don't want you to die on your own.

1382
00:55:56,310 --> 00:56:00,140
(Ji Hyo plans to get a hint through Gyun Sang.)

1383
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:05,110
She said she's the queen inside my heart.

1384
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:08,070
(You're the only queen for me.)

1385
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:10,740
Thank you. Thank you, Gyun Sang.

1386
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:11,870
Don't say that.

1387
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:19,540
I hope, like in the movies, she turns out to be the real one.

1388
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:24,010
(Is Ji Hyo the real queen like Gyun Sang wished for?)

1389
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,170
Let me turn this on.

1390
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:27,590
(6 hours ago)

1391
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:28,820
I knew it.

1392
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:31,370
Ji Hyo, you're not the real queen.

1393
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:35,010
(Ji Hyo is not the real queen!)

1394
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:37,370
This is the Gifted Education Centre.

1395
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:39,440
I thought it was this way.

1396
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:41,410
Ji Hyo!

1397
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:43,410
Ji Hyo is here. She's here.

1398
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:45,370
- Hurry up.
 - Is it just the two of you?

1399
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,810
Ji Hyo, tell me this. Are you the real queen?

1400
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:49,930
I'm not. I'm trying to help you.

1401
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:50,970
(She tells the truth so that they can form an ally.)

1402
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:52,740
- It's not me.
 - That sounds so convincing.

1403
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:53,940
- I'm trying to help you.
 - She won't betray us.

1404
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:58,270
Then let's have Gyun Sang visit the Betrayal Room.

1405
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:01,840
(Gyun Sang heads to the Betrayal Room for the hint.)

1406
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,910
You're my queen. Right, Ji Hyo?

1407
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:05,910
(You're my queen.)

1408
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:07,440
- Of course.
 - I'll be back.

1409
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:09,340
(Oh, goodness.)

1410
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:11,460
Stop talking rubbish. Hurry up.

1411
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,940
- Where is it, anyway?
 - Hurry up.

1412
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,540
- Where was it?
 - Look for it.

1413
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:17,140
(Will Gyun Sang earn the hint and return safely?)

1414
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:19,980
(Striding)

1415
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,270
I feel so bad.

1416
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:22,610
(I'll do this for Ji Hyo.)

1417
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,240
I feel like I'm betraying Ji Hyo.

1418
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,240
(They search intently.)

1419
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,310
(If he gets caught by Team Shin Hye, their plan will be over.)

1420
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:33,710
They're not here either?

1421
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:40,170
(Finally,)

1422
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:42,040
(he finds the Betrayal Room!)

1423
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:47,610
(There's a decisive hint in this room about the queen's identity.)

1424
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:53,140
(Gyun Sang has no choice but to betray Ji Hyo now.)

1425
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,210
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

1426
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:58,010
(He changes his mind after Ji Hyo convinces him to do so.)

1427
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:00,030
(My goodness!)

1428
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:04,130
(What is the hint?)

1429
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:06,440
Where are they?

1430
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,240
There are so many of us, so they must be hiding.

1431
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,340
They can't do anything by hiding.

1432
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,940
- What's that?
 - Somebody betrayed their team.

1433
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:13,940
No way.

1434
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:16,040
The Betrayal Room on the fourth floor is closed.

1435
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:19,810
- The Betrayal Room on...
 - I think it was the tall guy.

1436
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:21,540
Let's go to the fourth floor.

1437
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,910
Let's check it out.

1438
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:24,010
(What is Gyun Sang's new guess?)

1439
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:25,840
Let's go.

1440
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,540
We have to eliminate them fast.

1441
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:31,640
(The allies also head to the 4th floor.)

1442
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:35,570
Gyun Sang.

1443
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:40,970
(Oh, my! Is he wearing yellow?)

1444
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,440
(He decides to be loyal to Queen Sung Kyoung.)

1445
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,970
I saw the hint.

1446
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:47,210
- Be quiet.
 - I saw the decisive hint.

1447
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:50,240
- I changed my shirt.
 - You probably changed it before.

1448
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:54,740
I saw the hint before I changed my shirt.

1449
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:56,140
You change afterwards.

1450
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:59,440
(He knows the hint?)

1451
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:01,310
- I'm telling the truth.
 - No way.

1452
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:04,140
There are two rooms left. I'm telling the truth.

1453
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,540
(He warns everybody else...)

1454
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,770
(and runs for his life.)

1455
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:10,410
(They feel conflicted again.)

1456
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:11,650
Should we switch?

1457
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:13,610
- Let's eliminate him first.
 - That's the first step.

1458
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:16,670
- Come on.
 - I can't run because of my back.

1459
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:18,210
I want to be able to help.

1460
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:22,840
(Gyun Sang runs to find Queen Sung Kyoung.)

1461
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,210
Where did he go?

1462
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:26,240
Where did he go?

1463
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:29,310
- Come here!
 - Where?

1464
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:30,340
Ji Hyo.

1465
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:33,170
Gary, Gyun Sang changed his shirt.

1466
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,340
- Did you make him?
 - Yes, I did.

1467
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:37,540
- It doesn't matter if I die.
 - I know.

1468
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:38,870
- Let's eliminate her.
 - It doesn't matter.

1469
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:40,910
- Let's eliminate her.
 - You can kill me.

1470
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,140
- The three of us?
 - But be careful.

1471
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:44,310
But I want to see what colour Gyun Sang is wearing.

1472
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:45,640
- It's yellow.
 - He's wearing yellow.

1473
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,640
It's yellow, right? See?

1474
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,310
(Ripping)

1475
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:50,940
- That's fine.
 - She's not it.

1476
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:52,610
- Okay.
 - You're all going to be flogged.

1477
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:55,310
You'll all be flogged. You better run to the Betrayal Room.

1478
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:56,310
(They're suddenly panicking.)

1479
00:59:56,310 --> 00:59:57,310
- Did you...
 - We'll be flogged?

1480
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:59,240
I told you already.

1481
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,240
It's not Shin Hye. It's Sung Kyoung.

1482
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,510
That's not true.

1483
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:04,140
- This is...
 - I don't care.

1484
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,010
- It's not Ji Hyo, right?
 - Gyun Sang...

1485
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:08,110
- had the hint for sure.
 - Right?

1486
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:10,140
- Is that right?
 - He chose based on the hint.

1487
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,300
What hint?

1488
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,440
- Does he still have it?
 - There was a hint...

1489
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:15,340
- in the Betrayal Room.
 - Of course, there is.

1490
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:16,840
Let's go.

1491
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,810
- Shin Hye, say something.
 - No, it's not.

1492
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:20,510
It's not that. That's not it.

1493
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:23,540
Did you see that? I told you. I told you things will become chaotic.

1494
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:26,700
Gyun Sang holds an important key.

1495
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,440
(What does she mean?)

1496
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:33,220
(Strolling)

1497
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,840
Are you not well? Why are you walking so slowly?

1498
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,670
My back hurts, so I will walk slowly.

1499
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:38,840
Please guard Shin Hye well.

1500
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:43,610
- My gosh.
 - My back really hurts.

1501
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,950
- Really?
 - I kept shouting a while ago.

1502
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:49,570
(She's nervous.)

1503
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,640
There are only two rooms left.

1504
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:58,710
(The crack in the team is getting bigger and bigger.)

1505
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:02,470
(Jae Seok, who trusts Shin Hye, searches the 5th floor.)

1506
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:04,140
They are here. They're here.

1507
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:07,170
(Team Sung Kyoung appears!)

1508
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:08,440
(They finally get the chance to make a roundup.)

1509
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,710
Come down. Everyone, hurry up and come down.

1510
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:12,040
We have to go down.

1511
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:13,440
Go down?

1512
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:15,840
My back hurts.

1513
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:19,430
Good, good. The vibe is good now.

1514
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:21,410
All right. Let's just make one more person our team.

1515
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:25,170
(Team Shin Hye starts the arrest operation.)

1516
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:26,870
We can meet them.

1517
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:28,670
- We can meet them.
 - It's Shin Hye.

1518
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:31,510
- You left. Min Seok, look.
 - Shin Hye, wait.

1519
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:33,770
- The hint is "Crazy".
 - No.

1520
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:35,760
- No.
 - The hint is "Crazy".

1521
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,360
(Was that the hint Gyun Sang read?)

1522
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,770
Go to the Betrayal Room.

1523
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:39,940
There are two rooms left.

1524
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:43,040
Why do you think he didn't go to the team with more people?

1525
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,440
- It's because...
 - There are two left.

1526
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,870
- The hint is "Crazy".
 - Ji Hyo sent them to us on purpose.

1527
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,070
If we win, you will live.

1528
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:52,970
- Living is more important.
 - Think about it.

1529
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:54,840
(If the hint is really "Crazy",)

1530
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:58,340
(Sung Kyoung is certainly the queen.)

1531
01:01:58,670 --> 01:01:59,940
Hey.

1532
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,860
Gyun Sang, you betrayer.

1533
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:03,970
- That's not it.
 - Jong Kook.

1534
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,640
- Jong Kook, join us.
 - Hurry up.

1535
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,740
(It's your choice to receive the flogging or not.)

1536
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,540
- Hurry. You don't have time.
 - Just join us.

1537
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:11,130
- Jong Kook!
 - Jong Kook!

1538
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:12,810
What floor was it, Gyun Sang?

1539
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:14,380
- What floor was it? The 4th floor?
 - The 4th floor.

1540
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:15,840
- Then...
 - But it took us three seconds.

1541
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,750
come down to the second floor. Hurry.

1542
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:18,870
- Hey!
 - Okay.

1543
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:20,010
(Yes!)

1544
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:23,010
What? What's going on? What is he doing?

1545
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:25,870
- Run! Ride the elevator!
 - What's this?

1546
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:29,710
What's wrong?

1547
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:33,110
(They rush to the Betrayal Room.)

1548
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:34,840
- Hurry up.
 - Go to the second floor.

1549
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,110
- Catch Jong Kook.
 - Where was it? There it is.

1550
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:41,110
(But they are too late.)

1551
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:43,960
- Hey!
 - I'm in.

1552
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,170
I'm good.

1553
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:48,140
(He's ready to betray!)

1554
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:50,140
When we come together, we can catch him.

1555
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,640
As soon as he comes out, we must eliminate him.

1556
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,810
Someone could've gone to the third floor.

1557
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:59,410
(And that would be Gary.)

1558
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,810
What's this?

1559
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:06,970
(Seok Jin already entered the room on the 3rd floor.)

1560
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:11,270
(When it comes to betrayal, Seok Jin is better.)

1561
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:12,710
Whoever comes first gets to take the room.

1562
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:14,370
(The last Betrayal Room goes to Seok Jin.)

1563
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:15,710
I'm done.

1564
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:16,970
(Seok Jin takes the last Room.)

1565
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:19,410
(Gary is sad.)

1566
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:23,670
(Gyun Sang, Jong Kook and Seok Jin betray their teams.)

1567
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:26,570
(The Betrayal Rooms are sold out!)

1568
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:28,180
- What is it?
 - You go first.

1569
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:29,770
You're alone. Wait. What's this?

1570
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:32,210
- Come here.
 - This is the time.

1571
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:34,440
Catch Min Seok!

1572
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:38,320
- Hey!
 - Hey!

1573
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,810
- Catch Min Seok!
 - Shin Hye!

1574
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:45,210
(The lone chick becomes a good target.)

1575
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:46,340
(His name tag is ripped.)

1576
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:49,470
- We did it. Catch Jae Seok!
 - We did it.

1577
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:50,870
Catch Jae Seok!

1578
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:51,940
(It's chaos.)

1579
01:03:56,540 --> 01:04:01,120
Min Seok is out. Min Seok is out.

1580
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,370
He's our team.

1581
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:04,440
(He can't believe it.)

1582
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:07,440
We got tricked by Jong Kook.

1583
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:10,870
In any case, betray me and...

1584
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:11,940
Trust us.

1585
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:14,140
I will rip the skin off your backs.

1586
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:16,010
Watch me.

1587
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:18,750
I am so angry!

1588
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:20,040
Kim Jong Kook.

1589
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,170
(He gets betrayed by the one he trusted.)

1590
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:30,440
(I've been waiting for you to come out of this room.)

1591
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,110
Gary, this isn't right.

1592
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:35,470
I can't help it either. I have to survive.

1593
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:37,770
Wait a minute!

1594
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:42,110
(While Gary can't run, Seok Jin sprints.)

1595
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:46,010
Seok Jin! Seok Jin! Come down!

1596
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:48,320
- Come on.
 - Come on down.

1597
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,740
Hurry up and come down!

1598
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:53,320
(Jong Kook joins Team Sung Kyoung, too!)

1599
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,440
High-five!

1600
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,840
(Welcome to the team!)

1601
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,470
(Jong Kook is the VIP member!)

1602
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:03,470
Kim Jong Kook! Kim Jong Kook!

1603
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:05,640
You've been waiting to change teams.

1604
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,440
- You've been waiting.
 - That's right.

1605
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,710
- You've waited.
 - We did it.

1606
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:12,710
(What was the hint that Jong Kook and Seok Jin saw?)

1607
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:16,370
"Crazy".

1608
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:18,270
(Gyun Sang was telling the truth.)

1609
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:20,370
It's right.

1610
01:05:21,170 --> 01:05:24,440
(If the hint is "Crazy",)

1611
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:29,540
(the queen is Sung Kyoung for sure.)

1612
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:34,010
(In the preliminary meeting, she picked a rose.)

1613
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:36,640
Sung Kyoung, you are the real queen.

1614
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:39,710
(All right!)

1615
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:45,410
(Sung Kyoung is the real queen!)

1616
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,240
They have more people. Why take more people?

1617
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,840
Jong Kook ran down.

1618
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:53,010
I am sorry, Jae Seok.

1619
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:55,240
I am sorry, Jae Seok. I am not the real queen.

1620
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,010
- You're not?
 - You're not?

1621
01:05:57,010 --> 01:05:58,540
(You are not the real queen?)

1622
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:00,640
I wanted to win the game.

1623
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:05,170
Honestly, when I went to the Room, Seok Jin was already there.

1624
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:07,440
I was a little late.

1625
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:12,700
When I saw your face, you didn't look so confident.

1626
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,440
Honestly, Shin Hye,

1627
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:17,940
- I've been looking for loopholes.
 - I know it.

1628
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:21,640
- Jae Seok, we can...
 - I wanted to win fast.

1629
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:22,740
(They have only one option.)

1630
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:24,210
We have to rip Sung Kyoung's name tag.

1631
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:26,040
That's better even if we get flogged.

1632
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,340
- Let's go.
 - Let's go.

1633
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,510
- You have to rip her name tag.
 - I will.

1634
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:34,940
- We will wrap it up.
 - Okay.

1635
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:36,670
I can hear something.

1636
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:40,870
The only thing that team can do is eliminate Sung Kyoung.

1637
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:42,670
So we have to guard her well.

1638
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:44,510
(They will guard Sung Kyoung with all their strength.)

1639
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:49,840
(Only the queens are allowed to rip each other's name tags.)

1640
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:52,260
- There!
 - Where?

1641
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:53,430
Hey, be careful!

1642
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:54,460
Where?

1643
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:56,040
(The final battle begins.)

1644
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,740
(They're surprised by the army of members.)

1645
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:00,210
Why are they so bold?

1646
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,910
- What gave you the courage?
 - They're out of their wits.

1647
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:04,180
That's right.

1648
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:06,470
You must've thought very easily of me.

1649
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:08,570
No. No.

1650
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:10,270
I'm so scared.

1651
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:11,740
Come on.

1652
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:14,670
- She's strong. She's strong.
 - Shin Hye.

1653
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:21,300
(We just have to protect Sung Kyoung.)

1654
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,280
- Shin Hye.
 - She's strong.

1655
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,240
(Team Sung Kyoung is confident.)

1656
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:26,940
- You...
 - You can't rip her name tag anyway.

1657
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:28,170
Grab her!

1658
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:31,910
(They grab Sung Kyoung!)

1659
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:35,510
(They wait for the right timing and launch an attack!)

1660
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:40,110
(What will happen?)

1661
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:42,140
(Ripping)

1662
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:45,910
(Has someone's name tag been ripped?)

1663
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:47,210
You have to rip it!

1664
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:51,840
(Sung Kyoung is on the floor. Is she out?)

1665
01:07:52,810 --> 01:07:55,210
(Queen Sung Kyoung is alive!)

1666
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:59,540
- We got it. Jae Seok is out.
 - That was close.

1667
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,240
I'm out.

1668
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:02,310
(Jae Seok is out.)

1669
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:05,540
Grab her!

1670
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:08,430
- No! No!
 - Come on!

1671
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:10,210
(Ripping)

1672
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:13,070
(Even Jae Seok's last attempt was in vain.)

1673
01:08:15,870 --> 01:08:18,140
(Queen Shin Hye is in trouble.)

1674
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:20,370
Be careful. You have to survive.

1675
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:22,770
(She launches another attack!)

1676
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:25,970
(It's Shin Hye versus Sung Kyoung.)

1677
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:27,080
(Only the queens can rip each other's name tags.)

1678
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,580
Shin Hye, please.

1679
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:34,540
(Gary can't fight any longer.)

1680
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:35,710
- Time to go.
 - He's ripped.

1681
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,240
No. Come on.

1682
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,000
- Sung Kyoung.
 - We have no choice.

1683
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,470
- We have to do this, Shin Hye.
 - You can do it.

1684
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:44,040
(Jong Kook and Seok Jin join.)

1685
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:46,540
Shin Hye, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1686
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:50,270
Shin Hye, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1687
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:51,370
(Shin Hye is out.)

1688
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:53,080
Sorry, Shin Hye!

1689
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,470
(Shin Hye is out.)

1690
01:08:56,870 --> 01:09:02,080
(Team Sung Kyoung wins.)

1691
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:03,870
("Protect the Queen" is over.)

1692
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:07,510
Sung Kyoung managed to survive until the end. Please go up to the podium.

1693
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:11,310
(Sung Kyoung was the real queen.)

1694
01:09:11,310 --> 01:09:12,770
She was the real queen!

1695
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,870
(Sung Kyoung was the real queen.)

1696
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:17,210
It was her!

1697
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:20,940
How is it, Min Seok? Ready to be flogged?

1698
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:25,210
- There it is!
 - What's that?

1699
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:27,110
Inside her shoe, it says "Real Queen".

1700
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:28,210
(The identity of the real queen was written inside the shoe.)

1701
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:31,740
The true queen, Sung Kyoung, will receive this diamond tiara.

1702
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:36,220
(She receives a diamond tiara.)

1703
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:38,670
- It's beautiful.
 - Wear it over your hat.

1704
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:43,170
(The ones who chose Sung Kyoung will be exempt from the penalty.)

1705
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:45,810
Now, it's time to get flogged.

1706
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:48,510
It's time.

1707
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:50,140
(The time has come.)

1708
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:52,170
(It's flogging time!)

1709
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:55,940
- I love you.
 - He turned it sideways.

1710
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:57,640
You have to hit lower.

1711
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,010
Oh, here?

1712
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,970
(Ouch!)

1713
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:04,740
(What a strong swing!)

1714
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:05,990
My goodness.

1715
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:07,340
- That looked painful.
 - You held on. Good job.

1716
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:08,640
That really hurt.

1717
01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:10,170
- I'll start.
 - Okay.

1718
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,170
Poor you.

1719
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,240
Stop rubbing it.

1720
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:15,350
You've made a wrong decision.

1721
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:16,610
Poor you.

1722
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:17,710
I'm sorry, Jae Seok.

1723
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:19,260
- You've made a wrong decision.
 - I'm fine, Shin Hye.

1724
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:20,510
Poor you.

1725
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:23,540
(Slap)

1726
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:27,870
(The power from the hit makes him stand up.)

1727
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:29,610
- That was strong.
 - It really hurts.

1728
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:33,270
(He can feel the pain rising from his bottom.)

1729
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:34,520
Don't rub with your hands.

1730
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,310
I suddenly feel competitive about this.

1731
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:37,580
What?

1732
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:39,270
I just don't want to lose.

1733
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:42,080
I just don't want to feel defeated.

1734
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:43,580
(He swings far.)

1735
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:44,640
- My goodness.
 - I just don't...

1736
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,580
- want to lose.
 - All right. How about...

1737
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:48,910
after saying goodbye, you flog him immediately?

1738
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:50,510
All right. Let Kwang Soo's swing be the finisher.

1739
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:52,770
(What?)

1740
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:54,310
Does that mean I can't say goodbye?

1741
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:57,210
(Everyone agrees to end the day with Kwang Soo's swing.)

1742
01:10:57,210 --> 01:10:58,940
All right, queens.

1743
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:02,440
How was it today? Your drama will be aired soon, too.

1744
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:06,140
Yes, our new drama "Doctors" will air tomorrow evening.

1745
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:09,080
We hope you love our new drama.

1746
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,340
(While the queens say goodbye,)

1747
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:12,840
(Kwang Soo warms up.)

1748
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,970
(Gary can only laugh.)

1749
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:17,390
I became the real queen today...

1750
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:18,510
and also won the race.

1751
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:19,630
(He practises swinging.)

1752
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:20,940
I'd like to come on this show again.

1753
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:22,410
(Now's the time!)

1754
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:23,440
He's...

1755
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,170
(Jae Seok flogs him.)

1756
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:27,610
Okay. We're done for today.

1757
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:28,800
(A flogging for a flogging.)

1758
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,910
(We'd like to thank all our guests for joining us today.)

1759
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:33,640
- Well done!
 - Thank you!

1760
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:37,580
(The strongest enemies have appeared in front of Running Man.)

1761
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:40,740
(Lee Kyung Kyu and the Avengers)

1762
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:44,610
(They compete for the throne.)

1763
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:47,170
(This will be a completely different type of variety show.)

1764
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:50,640
("Running Rumble", a survival game, is coming soon.)

1765
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,670
(Name Tag Elimination with never-ending twists)

1766
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:54,270
(Who will be the last one standing?)

1767
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:58,040
It was really fun. I'll be going now.

1768
01:11:58,370 --> 01:12:00,970
(Running Man vs Avengers)
