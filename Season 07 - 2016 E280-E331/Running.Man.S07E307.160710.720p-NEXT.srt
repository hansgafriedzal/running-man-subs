1
00:00:05,883 --> 00:00:07,483
(Last Sunday night)

2
00:00:08,513 --> 00:00:11,043
(Last week's episode of Running Man is almost over.)

3
00:00:11,043 --> 00:00:12,213
(Running Man Producer)

4
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:15,113
(Why is he holding his cell phone so anxiously?)

5
00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:17,383
(The Running Man is on.)

6
00:00:17,883 --> 00:00:21,583
(The trailer for the next episode is on.)

7
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:24,443
(The following segment is based on the discussion from our meeting.)

8
00:00:24,443 --> 00:00:26,743
We don't have anything filmed for next week's episode.

9
00:00:26,743 --> 00:00:28,913
Should we reveal the mission in the trailer?

10
00:00:28,913 --> 00:00:31,543
It'll be a way to check if the members watch the episodes.

11
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:33,543
(Therefore)

12
00:00:33,543 --> 00:00:36,183
Running Man members, this is your first mission.

13
00:00:36,613 --> 00:00:40,943
Once you see this, call the main producer right away.

14
00:00:42,113 --> 00:00:43,783
(The first three to call will have an advantage for the final mission.)

15
00:00:43,783 --> 00:00:46,113
(What will happen in the next week's episode of Running Man?)

16
00:00:47,543 --> 00:00:50,683
(Although he decided to give a mission through the trailer, )

17
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:54,813
(he's not sure if the members would watch the show.)

18
00:00:54,813 --> 00:00:59,890
(What if no one calls?)

19
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:05,043
(His phone doesn't seem to be ringing.)

20
00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:07,583
(Then, )

21
00:01:10,683 --> 00:01:12,783
(his phone starts ringing.)

22
00:01:14,653 --> 00:01:17,427
(Who is this, calling a minute into the trailer?)

23
00:01:17,427 --> 00:01:19,350
You are the first to call.

24
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,483
Oh, thank you.

25
00:01:21,943 --> 00:01:22,983
(And he gets the second call.)

26
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:24,583
Another member is calling me right now.

27
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:29,713
(Who will be the next member to get the advantage?)

28
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:33,883
Someone just sent me a message to call you now.

29
00:01:34,913 --> 00:01:38,560
Other members are calling me now.

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,013
I see.

31
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:41,813
- Okay. Thank you.
 -  Okay.

32
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,543
Phone calls are flooding in now.

33
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:47,010
Don't lie to me. Are you serious?

34
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,427
I'm serious. I was surprised too.

35
00:01:49,427 --> 00:01:50,483
Really?

36
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:53,483
I never thought I'd get this many phone calls.

37
00:01:53,483 --> 00:01:54,943
I already have three missed calls.

38
00:01:55,843 --> 00:01:59,183
(Which three members would get the merits?)

39
00:02:00,783 --> 00:02:04,643
(Two days later, on the day of the shooting)

40
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:06,513
Chuncheon!

41
00:02:07,643 --> 00:02:09,383
(Are the members heading to Chuncheon?)

42
00:02:09,383 --> 00:02:10,583
- Are we taking the subway?
 -  Hello.

43
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,183
- Good morning.
 -  Hello.

44
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:14,243
Are we taking the subway to get to Chuncheon?

45
00:02:14,243 --> 00:02:17,243
Today, we will go on a trip with guests.

46
00:02:17,243 --> 00:02:18,513
- With guest?
 -  A trip?

47
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,053
- With guest?
 -  With guest?

48
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:21,813
- Really?
 -  This is exciting.

49
00:02:22,513 --> 00:02:24,100
Today's race is called...

50
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,913
"The Best Couple's Race".

51
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:27,183
- "The Best Couple's Race"?
 -  The best couple?

52
00:02:27,183 --> 00:02:30,243
We'll take the subway here in Yongsan and get off at Chuncheon.

53
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:35,613
At the next stop, both female and male guests will join us.

54
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,613
(Both female and male guests?)

55
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:38,283
- Both male and female?
 -  Right.

56
00:02:38,683 --> 00:02:39,943
Is Cool our guest today?

57
00:02:40,713 --> 00:02:43,943
(Jong Kook is so old-fashioned.)

58
00:02:43,943 --> 00:02:45,313
There are no mixed groups nowadays.

59
00:02:45,313 --> 00:02:46,343
Right.

60
00:02:46,343 --> 00:02:48,213
- It's coming. ITX is coming.
 -  It's here.

61
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:50,283
That's ITX. I've never taken it before.

62
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,350
Let's get on.

63
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,983
- Wow, it's good.
 -  It's big.

64
00:02:55,783 --> 00:02:58,043
- We can bring bicycles, too.
 -  It's neat.

65
00:02:58,043 --> 00:02:59,683
I'm sure couples will enjoy this subway trip.

66
00:02:59,683 --> 00:03:01,883
- Wow. It's nice.
 -  It's called ITX.

67
00:03:01,883 --> 00:03:03,313
- Can we sit?
 -  Take your seats.

68
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:05,343
- Please sit by the window.
 -  By the window?

69
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,543
- I wonder what will happen.
 -  This is amazing.

70
00:03:08,543 --> 00:03:09,737
Years back, we had to go...

71
00:03:09,737 --> 00:03:12,213
to Cheongnyangni Station to take a train.

72
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,183
I never missed school trips even when I skipped classes.

73
00:03:15,183 --> 00:03:16,483
- You're incredible.
 -  I know.

74
00:03:16,483 --> 00:03:18,613
- School trips are the best.
 -  That's right.

75
00:03:18,613 --> 00:03:20,913
- Did you go with Jeon Do Yeon?
 -  Of course, I did.

76
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:22,483
Oh, really?

77
00:03:22,483 --> 00:03:25,013
Wait, was she there? I think she was with us.

78
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:27,970
If Jae Seok was handsome, he would have been very popular.

79
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,213
This is so sad.

80
00:03:29,913 --> 00:03:32,643
- But I...
 -  Don't call her name so friendly.

81
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:35,483
- It's weird.
 -  Why don't you call her...

82
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:37,483
- and invite her to our show?
 -  You mean, Do Yeon?

83
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,683
We haven't been in touch for more than 20 years.

84
00:03:40,183 --> 00:03:42,243
- Then, she's a stranger to you.
 -  Right.

85
00:03:42,243 --> 00:03:43,670
Who else did you go on the trip with?

86
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,713
- Ye Ji Won?
 -  Right. Ji Won.

87
00:03:44,713 --> 00:03:46,013
- Yes, Ji Won!
 -  I see.

88
00:03:46,013 --> 00:03:48,813
Her real name is Yu Jeong.

89
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,013
- That name is prettier.
 -  Her name is Yu Jeong.

90
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:52,443
There was Ha Soo Bin and Kim Won Jun as well.

91
00:03:53,143 --> 00:03:55,883
Won Jun majored in film.

92
00:03:55,883 --> 00:03:57,513
- Wasn't he popular?
 -  Yes.

93
00:03:57,513 --> 00:04:01,083
- He was handsome, right?
 -  So we male students were jealous.

94
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,243
- I remember.
 -  You didn't like him, did you?

95
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:03,313
I didn't.

96
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,443
- Why did you have to hate him?
 -  I mean, male students did.

97
00:04:06,443 --> 00:04:09,043
- You two are in different leagues.
 -  Why you...

98
00:04:09,043 --> 00:04:10,813
- Jae Seok is so funny...
 -  You're so mean.

99
00:04:10,813 --> 00:04:13,383
That everyone finds him very hilarious.

100
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:15,683
- But girls don't fall for him.
 -  That's true.

101
00:04:15,683 --> 00:04:17,543
- What do you mean?
 -  As he said,

102
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:21,543
other students loved to be with me during trips because I was funny.

103
00:04:21,543 --> 00:04:23,243
- But in the end...
 -  They never think of you as a man.

104
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:24,743
That's right.

105
00:04:24,743 --> 00:04:28,513
"Jae Seok, you're so funny. That was so hilarious!"

106
00:04:28,513 --> 00:04:30,813
But at late nights...

107
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,983
when they gather in small groups and drink,

108
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:34,483
I was left alone.

109
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:39,113
(I always found myself alone in the end.)

110
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:42,413
- It's because...
 -  They didn't like you.

111
00:04:42,413 --> 00:04:44,853
It's because the students who majored in film joined us.

112
00:04:44,853 --> 00:04:46,413
- All right, everyone.
 -  Yes?

113
00:04:46,413 --> 00:04:48,483
We gave you a mission through the trailer...

114
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:50,713
to check if you really watch our show.

115
00:04:50,713 --> 00:04:52,213
I missed it.

116
00:04:52,213 --> 00:04:53,713
- I'm sorry.
 -  Anyway...

117
00:04:53,713 --> 00:04:55,313
- I'm sorry.
 -  I apologise.

118
00:04:55,313 --> 00:04:56,913
- I am so sorry.
 -  I'm sorry.

119
00:04:57,853 --> 00:04:59,543
(48 hours ago)

120
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:03,543
(Exactly a minute after the show was over)

121
00:05:07,983 --> 00:05:11,183
(Who called the producer first?)

122
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,313
It's Kwang Soo.

123
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:16,353
(Kwang Soo called first.)

124
00:05:17,813 --> 00:05:19,853
- Kwang Soo.
 -  Yes?

125
00:05:20,743 --> 00:05:23,713
- You are the first to call.
 -  Thank you.

126
00:05:24,243 --> 00:05:25,713
How did you call me?

127
00:05:26,283 --> 00:05:27,713
I was watching the programme and...

128
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,583
Did your mother tell you?

129
00:05:30,383 --> 00:05:31,443
That's right.

130
00:05:31,443 --> 00:05:33,643
- Anyway...
 -  You sound so cold.

131
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,783
(Kwang Soo, we're shooting now.)

132
00:05:36,783 --> 00:05:41,643
Anyway, another member is calling me now.

133
00:05:41,643 --> 00:05:42,713
Okay.

134
00:05:42,713 --> 00:05:45,643
You called me first.

135
00:05:45,643 --> 00:05:47,183
Thank you so much.

136
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:49,283
(The phone rings.)

137
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,683
(Which member would take the second place?)

138
00:05:53,143 --> 00:05:54,183
Hello.

139
00:05:54,513 --> 00:05:55,543
Jae Seok.

140
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:57,343
(Jae Seok takes the second place.)

141
00:05:57,713 --> 00:06:00,983
Hello. Someone just sent me a message to call you now.

142
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:06,843
Jae Seok, you're the second member to call me.

143
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:09,266
Really? So I got the second place.

144
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:10,943
- That's right.
 -  Okay.

145
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,330
Others are calling me right now.

146
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,883
I see. Okay.

147
00:06:15,883 --> 00:06:17,413
Okay. Thank you.

148
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:19,243
Hello, Seok Jin.

149
00:06:19,243 --> 00:06:20,913
(Seok Jin takes the third place.)

150
00:06:22,343 --> 00:06:23,413
Hi, Ju Hyeong.

151
00:06:24,013 --> 00:06:25,483
(Seok Jin drops honourifics as he's in a hurry.)

152
00:06:25,483 --> 00:06:26,743
I got one of the three places, right?

153
00:06:27,383 --> 00:06:29,800
- Seok Jin.
 -  Yes?

154
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,343
Phone calls are flooding in now.

155
00:06:32,713 --> 00:06:34,576
Don't lie to me. Are you serious?

156
00:06:34,576 --> 00:06:36,800
I'm serious. I was surprised too.

157
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,883
Really?

158
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:41,313
- Seok Jin, you are...
 -  What is this about?

159
00:06:41,783 --> 00:06:44,413
The third person to call.

160
00:06:44,843 --> 00:06:45,843
Yes!

161
00:06:46,513 --> 00:06:48,924
(Running Man Mission Call Centre closes in just three minutes.)

162
00:06:48,924 --> 00:06:52,043
In just one minute after the end of the show,

163
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,083
Kwang Soo called me.

164
00:06:56,013 --> 00:06:57,643
You're just going to tell everyone that?

165
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:01,273
- Kwang Soo called first,
 -  I enjoyed the show.

166
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:03,260
- so he gets three points.
 -  Yes!

167
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,643
- He gained three points.
 -  That's amazing.

168
00:07:05,643 --> 00:07:06,713
- What's that?
 -  I was...

169
00:07:06,713 --> 00:07:08,014
- the very first one.
 -  Kwang Soo watches the show...

170
00:07:08,014 --> 00:07:09,583
when he's with his girlfriend.

171
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,213
- What are you talking about?
 -  Really.

172
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:12,713
- What are you talking about?
 -  It's true.

173
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:15,080
- He watches it when he's with...
 -  That's not true.

174
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,413
I watched it with my mum.

175
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:19,583
He saved his girlfriend's name as "mum" on his phone.

176
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,927
- That's not true.
 -  Hey!

177
00:07:21,927 --> 00:07:23,913
Kwang Soo, who's your mum?

178
00:07:23,913 --> 00:07:25,283
It was my mum.

179
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:28,083
- It was your girlfriend, wasn't it?
 -  No. No.

180
00:07:28,483 --> 00:07:29,683
- All right.
 -  I am sorry.

181
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:33,113
Then, Jae Seok called second.

182
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:36,913
And Jae Seok gets two points.

183
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:38,613
(Jae Seok gets one point less than Kwang Soo.)

184
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:40,943
- You take two points.
 -  I'm jealous.

185
00:07:40,943 --> 00:07:44,713
And Seok Jin almost called me at the same time.

186
00:07:44,713 --> 00:07:45,713
Nice, Seok Jin.

187
00:07:46,113 --> 00:07:49,643
Seok Jin gets one point.

188
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:51,383
All the unlucky ones got lucky this time.

189
00:07:51,813 --> 00:07:53,100
That's right.

190
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,190
It's our day today.

191
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,213
- We're at Cheongnyangni.
 -  We're here.

192
00:07:58,243 --> 00:08:02,483
(Which guests are waiting at Cheongnyangni Station?)

193
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,683
(Who are they?)

194
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:10,543
(Sistar shines brighter during summer.)

195
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,583
- Who is it?
 -  It's Sistar!

196
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:15,713
Look at them!

197
00:08:15,713 --> 00:08:16,943
There are four of them.

198
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:19,283
- What are their names?
 -  There's only Sistar.

199
00:08:19,283 --> 00:08:20,443
I saw him!

200
00:08:20,443 --> 00:08:22,183
- I saw Jong Kook.
 -  I only saw Jong Kook.

201
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:23,283
I pick Jong Kook.

202
00:08:25,643 --> 00:08:27,273
Honestly, give Jong Kook to me.

203
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,587
It's because...

204
00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:31,343
he can lift heavy things, and I am the heaviest.

205
00:08:31,953 --> 00:08:34,343
I think you fit well with Kwang Soo.

206
00:08:34,343 --> 00:08:37,134
Me? I was actually thinking about Kwang Soo.

207
00:08:37,134 --> 00:08:39,413
- I am going to take him from you.
 -  Try.

208
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:42,313
(Will the girls be able to decide on their partners without a problem?)

209
00:08:44,043 --> 00:08:46,683
(Welcome to the outing of Running Man.)

210
00:08:47,953 --> 00:08:51,383
(They will go shake the hearts of Running Man boys.)

211
00:08:52,543 --> 00:08:53,913
(She stealthily enters.)

212
00:08:54,913 --> 00:08:57,683
(It's Da Som.)

213
00:08:57,683 --> 00:08:59,843
- Oh dear!
 -  Oh my!

214
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:01,276
- Da Som!
 -  Welcome, Da Som!

215
00:09:01,276 --> 00:09:02,543
- Oh dear!
 -  Da Som!

216
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,983
- Welcome.
 -  Long time no see!

217
00:09:03,983 --> 00:09:05,243
(Kwang Soo claps to appeal to her.)

218
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:10,107
(The boys passionately appeal to her.)

219
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:11,903
- Da Som!
 -  Oh my.

220
00:09:11,903 --> 00:09:13,413
- Hello.
 -  Da Som!

221
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:15,413
- She's so beautiful.
 -  Da Som!

222
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:18,313
I heard you have an important key.

223
00:09:18,313 --> 00:09:19,413
- I have two points.
 -  Yes!

224
00:09:19,413 --> 00:09:21,213
- I have three.
 -  I have one.

225
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:22,687
They are the ones without any points.

226
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,013
- They have no points.
 -  We don't have any.

227
00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:26,700
Da Som, that's not important.

228
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,870
- We each have 1, 2, 3 points.
 -  That's right.

229
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,170
- One is the best.
 -  We are 1, 2, 3.

230
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,883
- I have three points.
 -  One is the best.

231
00:09:32,883 --> 00:09:35,013
- That's not important.
 -  They are all very unlucky.

232
00:09:35,343 --> 00:09:37,134
Yes. Kwang Soo is famous for being unlucky.

233
00:09:37,134 --> 00:09:39,113
- Why would you tell her that?
 -  They'll give you bad luck.

234
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:40,483
- Hey.
 -  I have two points.

235
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:43,083
- And...
 -  Why are you hesitating?

236
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,383
- I'm offended that you have doubts.
 -  Da Som.

237
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:46,583
Please close your eyes.

238
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,824
- Gosh...
 -  Gosh...

239
00:09:48,824 --> 00:09:50,543
- What's that?
 -  Why close our eyes?

240
00:09:50,543 --> 00:09:53,643
- That's too much.
 -  What's that?

241
00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:54,913
- Gosh...
 -  This is not good.

242
00:09:54,913 --> 00:09:56,810
- Please close your eyes.
 -  Okay.

243
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,907
I can't see well even with my eyes open.

244
00:09:58,907 --> 00:10:01,113
Whether I open or close my eyes, I look the same.

245
00:10:01,113 --> 00:10:03,300
Please close your eyes. I'm really coming.

246
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,083
(It looks like Da Som has made up her mind.)

247
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:10,843
(Will she be realistic and choose a man with points?)

248
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:14,050
(Who will Da Som choose?)

249
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,643
- You already won three games.
 -  They'll give out a lot of points.

250
00:10:16,643 --> 00:10:18,013
- Da Som.
 -  No, Da Som.

251
00:10:18,013 --> 00:10:19,883
All right. Please open your eyes.

252
00:10:20,613 --> 00:10:22,783
(She came to me!)

253
00:10:22,783 --> 00:10:24,166
Gosh...

254
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,977
- I knew this would happen.
 -  Yes.

255
00:10:25,977 --> 00:10:27,797
I knew it.

256
00:10:27,797 --> 00:10:29,933
- You're so cruel.
 -  Hey.

257
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:31,946
- Why do you like Kwang Soo?
 -  Gosh...

258
00:10:31,946 --> 00:10:34,783
It's not decided yet.

259
00:10:34,783 --> 00:10:38,683
- It's not?
 -  Other guests can come...

260
00:10:39,143 --> 00:10:42,213
- and like Kwang Soo too.
 -  Right.

261
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:44,213
- Da Som.
 -  Yes?

262
00:10:44,213 --> 00:10:45,703
From my understanding,

263
00:10:45,703 --> 00:10:46,983
you are not Kwang Soo's type.

264
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:49,037
What's wrong with you?

265
00:10:49,037 --> 00:10:51,013
- She is my type.
 -  Da Som, you're out.

266
00:10:51,013 --> 00:10:52,483
- I like girls like Da Som.
 -  I am serious.

267
00:10:52,483 --> 00:10:53,683
You're ruined.

268
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:57,437
When I was here several years ago,

269
00:10:57,437 --> 00:11:00,213
Kwang Soo told me that I was pretty.

270
00:11:00,213 --> 00:11:02,283
- He says that to everyone.
 -  No. No.

271
00:11:02,283 --> 00:11:04,343
I've never said it to Ji Hyo.

272
00:11:04,843 --> 00:11:06,443
(Don't bring me up.)

273
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,683
(It's my turn.)

274
00:11:09,213 --> 00:11:11,543
I had a feeling that Da Som won't be my partner.

275
00:11:11,543 --> 00:11:13,083
- Same here.
 -  Same here.

276
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,383
(Hyo Lyn enters!)

277
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,883
- You made all the fuss for...
 -  Oh dear!

278
00:11:18,883 --> 00:11:20,613
- Welcome!
 -  It's Hyo Lyn!

279
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:24,883
- Hyo Lyn!
 -  Welcome, Hyo Lyn!

280
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:26,383
- Hyo Lyn!
 -  Hyo Lyn!

281
00:11:26,383 --> 00:11:27,483
Welcome!

282
00:11:27,483 --> 00:11:29,613
Hyo Lyn is the best!

283
00:11:29,983 --> 00:11:31,183
Hyo Lyn is the best in Sistar.

284
00:11:31,183 --> 00:11:32,413
She is the best.

285
00:11:32,413 --> 00:11:34,183
(Were they like this a while ago?)

286
00:11:35,283 --> 00:11:36,843
- She can sing, and she can rap.
 -  I don't want Da Som.

287
00:11:36,843 --> 00:11:39,066
- She's good at everything.
 -  She is.

288
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,783
- I will tell you one thing.
 -  Okay.

289
00:11:41,213 --> 00:11:42,713
I have one point already.

290
00:11:43,113 --> 00:11:44,813
- One point?
 -  That means...

291
00:11:44,813 --> 00:11:46,143
- I'm number one.
 -  Hyo Lyn.

292
00:11:46,143 --> 00:11:47,443
Mr One Point, please take a seat.

293
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:48,913
I have two points.

294
00:11:48,913 --> 00:11:50,570
You sit down too, Mr Two Points.

295
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,783
I have three points.

296
00:11:51,783 --> 00:11:53,483
- Hey, what's wrong with you?
 -  You're with Da Som!

297
00:11:53,483 --> 00:11:54,883
- You're so mean.
 -  What does that make Da Som?

298
00:11:54,883 --> 00:11:56,683
- I'm just telling her...
 -  Why would you do that?

299
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:58,483
- for the sake of her knowing.
 -  You're unbelievable.

300
00:11:58,483 --> 00:12:00,713
- Did you see Da Som's face?
 -  You're a bad person.

301
00:12:00,713 --> 00:12:03,313
- I feel so bad for Da Som!
 -  This is who he is.

302
00:12:03,313 --> 00:12:07,783
If Hyo Lyn chooses Kwang Soo, she can tell Da Som, "Get out".

303
00:12:07,783 --> 00:12:09,543
- I feel so sorry for Da Som.
 -  I know.

304
00:12:09,543 --> 00:12:10,783
Nothing happened yet.

305
00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:12,183
- I know.
 -  Oh, no.

306
00:12:12,183 --> 00:12:14,043
- I won't do that.
 -  I feel bad for Da Som.

307
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:15,713
(It's time for Hyo Lyn to make a decision.)

308
00:12:15,713 --> 00:12:17,213
Please make a choice now.

309
00:12:17,213 --> 00:12:19,243
- With her, I can...
 -  Bo Ra...

310
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:21,143
- loves Song Joong Ki.
 -  Right.

311
00:12:21,143 --> 00:12:22,413
Bo Ra loves Song Joong Ki.

312
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:23,713
She's crazy about him.

313
00:12:23,713 --> 00:12:27,013
- You two would look good together.
 -  I know.

314
00:12:27,843 --> 00:12:29,713
Yes!

315
00:12:29,713 --> 00:12:30,783
No!

316
00:12:31,943 --> 00:12:33,370
This can't be happening.

317
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,843
- They can't be partners.
 -  When we were little,

318
00:12:35,843 --> 00:12:38,303
- cool students used to go out.
 -  By the way,

319
00:12:38,303 --> 00:12:41,013
- they look good together.
 -  The two bosses met.

320
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:42,313
- They are both very tanned.
 -  Honestly,

321
00:12:42,313 --> 00:12:44,813
I would've been pressured if Hyo Lyn chose me.

322
00:12:45,713 --> 00:12:47,183
- Same here.
 -  Same here.

323
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,683
- I'm being honest.
 -  Why would you say that?

324
00:12:48,683 --> 00:12:50,483
- Honestly.
 -  Really.

325
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:52,297
- So this is how it goes.
 -  Yes.

326
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:55,443
Isn't Bo Ra the most popular member of Sistar?

327
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:59,383
(Sistar equals Bo Ra!)

328
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,443
There's another guest approaching.

329
00:13:03,443 --> 00:13:05,134
- It's a man.
 -  Oh dear.

330
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:06,356
No way.

331
00:13:06,356 --> 00:13:08,613
(A hot male guest will complete the teams.)

332
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:11,483
- He's Monsta X!
 -  Hello.

333
00:13:11,483 --> 00:13:12,683
- Hello.
 -  Hello.

334
00:13:12,683 --> 00:13:14,883
(He's Shownu from Monsta X.)

335
00:13:15,643 --> 00:13:20,443
(He's got the hot body and dance moves.)

336
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:23,783
- It's Shownu.
 -  Shownu.

337
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:26,513
He was on "The Law of Jungle" recently.

338
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:28,943
And his nice body became a huge hit.

339
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:32,207
Gosh, do you have to put it that way?

340
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:33,783
His nice body became a huge hit?

341
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:35,783
Shownu is...

342
00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:37,713
Shownu, you can choose a partner too.

343
00:13:37,713 --> 00:13:39,443
- Shownu, make a pick.
 -  Okay.

344
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,224
- Your life depends on it.
 -  His life depends on it.

345
00:13:41,224 --> 00:13:42,683
I will stay beside Ji Hyo.

346
00:13:42,683 --> 00:13:43,843
- Go ahead.
 -  Okay.

347
00:13:43,843 --> 00:13:45,513
- Awesome.
 -  Congratulations.

348
00:13:45,513 --> 00:13:47,043
- There was Ji Hyo.
 -  Yes.

349
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:48,113
Yes! Yes!

350
00:13:48,443 --> 00:13:49,513
Bravo.

351
00:13:49,513 --> 00:13:51,700
When is Bo Ra coming?

352
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,413
(He's already waiting for Bo Ra.)

353
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:58,713
(Finally, that girl enters.)

354
00:14:00,713 --> 00:14:02,613
- I didn't force him.
 -  Bo Ra is here!

355
00:14:05,383 --> 00:14:07,613
(Bo Ra is here!)

356
00:14:08,143 --> 00:14:11,643
- Song Joong Ki!
 -  Bo Ra.

357
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,434
I have Joong Ki's number.

358
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:15,373
- She got a haircut.
 -  Bo Ra.

359
00:14:15,373 --> 00:14:18,043
- She's beautiful with short hair.
 -  She's Sistar's face.

360
00:14:18,043 --> 00:14:19,243
It's been a year, boys.

361
00:14:19,243 --> 00:14:21,170
- Yes.
 -  It's been a long time.

362
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,943
Bo Ra tries so hard.

363
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:25,307
I can't imagine Sistar without Bo Ra.

364
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:27,943
I will go with my first choice.

365
00:14:27,943 --> 00:14:29,343
- Please sit next to that person.
 -  Maybe she will go to Gary.

366
00:14:29,343 --> 00:14:31,043
- She looked at Gary.
 -  Come on.

367
00:14:31,043 --> 00:14:33,043
Oh, who did she say she wants?

368
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:35,213
(She acts cute.)

369
00:14:35,213 --> 00:14:38,883
(Bo Ra, why are you doing that to me?)

370
00:14:38,883 --> 00:14:40,183
- Oh, my. Bo Ra!
 -  Hey.

371
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:42,573
- Don't do that.
 -  Are you choosing him?

372
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:44,614
Bo Ra, is it Gary?

373
00:14:44,614 --> 00:14:46,534
It's been a long time since I saw Gary like that.

374
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:47,543
- Bo Ra.
 -  I was so surprised.

375
00:14:49,843 --> 00:14:51,783
(Will she choose Gary?)

376
00:14:51,783 --> 00:14:54,083
(Or will she choose Seok Jin who has Joong Ki's number?)

377
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,183
- Bo Ra. Bo Ra.
 -  I will choose...

378
00:14:56,643 --> 00:14:58,890
- Bo Ra.
 -  You, get out.

379
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,183
Oh dear!

380
00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:03,843
(Bo Ra chooses Kwang Soo!)

381
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:06,083
- I can't believe this.
 -  This is unbelievable.

382
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,613
- Gary...
 -  What's up with you?

383
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:09,634
You shouldn't have given me hope.

384
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:12,627
(Why would you tempt him?)

385
00:15:12,627 --> 00:15:14,483
Bo Ra chose Kwang So too.

386
00:15:14,483 --> 00:15:16,543
- So it's up to Kwang Soo now.
 -  Look at that.

387
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:17,943
- He will decide now?
 -  I knew this would happen.

388
00:15:17,943 --> 00:15:20,683
- Get out!
 -  He will make the decision now?

389
00:15:20,683 --> 00:15:21,713
I came first.

390
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:22,913
Get out.

391
00:15:22,913 --> 00:15:26,370
- Make your choice.
 -  Say it on the count of three.

392
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,483
- Okay.
 -  You can shout the name.

393
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,613
One, two, three.

394
00:15:33,383 --> 00:15:35,413
(You know love never changes, right?)

395
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:37,483
(Love changes.)

396
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:38,713
(Who will Kwang Soo choose?)

397
00:15:38,713 --> 00:15:40,583
Da Som, please move.

398
00:15:41,783 --> 00:15:44,613
(So love moves.)

399
00:15:44,613 --> 00:15:46,413
- Poor Da Som.
 -  Love changes, Da Som.

400
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,883
- I knew this would happen.
 -  Why would you...

401
00:15:48,883 --> 00:15:50,543
I knew this would happen.

402
00:15:50,543 --> 00:15:52,113
- I knew this would happen.
 -  I thought he chose her.

403
00:15:52,113 --> 00:15:54,713
- I was sure this would happen.
 -  That's who he is, Da Som.

404
00:15:54,713 --> 00:15:56,443
- Is she leaving like that?
 -  Is she?

405
00:15:56,443 --> 00:15:58,243
- Where are you going, Da Som?
 -  Please wait outside.

406
00:15:59,313 --> 00:16:01,283
- Really.
 -  Must I stay out?

407
00:16:01,783 --> 00:16:05,483
- Poor Da Som.
 -  Some guests are not here.

408
00:16:05,843 --> 00:16:07,843
- You became a couple now.
 -  Okay.

409
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:10,043
(Kwang Soo and Bo Ra become a couple.)

410
00:16:10,813 --> 00:16:13,143
Now, it's time for Su You... I mean So You.

411
00:16:14,013 --> 00:16:15,643
- It's So You!
 -  I see her!

412
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:17,583
(So You appears.)

413
00:16:19,013 --> 00:16:20,783
So You is the best.

414
00:16:20,783 --> 00:16:23,927
- How have you been, So You?
 -  How have you been?

415
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:25,713
(He tries to become her partner.)

416
00:16:25,713 --> 00:16:26,983
- What are you doing?
 -  You can't do that.

417
00:16:26,983 --> 00:16:28,513
- What are you doing?
 -  Come on.

418
00:16:28,513 --> 00:16:29,843
(That's cheating!)

419
00:16:29,843 --> 00:16:32,137
(Everyone claims to own So You.)

420
00:16:32,137 --> 00:16:33,183
What are you doing?

421
00:16:33,183 --> 00:16:34,883
- It's not decided, yet.
 -  She sat here.

422
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:36,513
- Tell me what's going on.
 -  So You sat here.

423
00:16:36,513 --> 00:16:40,283
- The guest gets to choose.
 -  Exactly.

424
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:42,513
- You should stay still.
 -  She sat here, right?

425
00:16:42,513 --> 00:16:44,343
Hey, you know what Jae Seok said, right?

426
00:16:44,343 --> 00:16:46,583
- He called you Su You.
 -  Hold on.

427
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,243
- Jae Seok!
 -  He called you Su You.

428
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:50,683
Do you think I would have called you Su You?

429
00:16:50,683 --> 00:16:51,683
He called you Su You.

430
00:16:51,683 --> 00:16:53,343
- Come on, Seok Jin.
 -  That's what he said.

431
00:16:53,343 --> 00:16:54,613
- They both said it.
 -  You're crazy, Seok Jin.

432
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,513
- That's because I lived in Suyu.
 -  You're bad!

433
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:58,443
- Why?
 -  You betrayed Da Som.

434
00:16:59,013 --> 00:17:00,013
(Don't put it that way.)

435
00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:01,013
- So You.
 -  Don't put it that way.

436
00:17:01,013 --> 00:17:05,683
(I'll take my revenge.)

437
00:17:05,683 --> 00:17:08,483
I'll give Da Som my spot.

438
00:17:08,483 --> 00:17:09,783
What becomes of me, then?

439
00:17:09,783 --> 00:17:11,983
Don't do that. Kwang Soo can get off at the next station.

440
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:13,413
- Go ahead.
 -  Why are you saying that?

441
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,183
- Kwang Soo.
 -  I don't know where we are.

442
00:17:15,183 --> 00:17:16,613
(The player should get off!)

443
00:17:16,613 --> 00:17:17,914
He can't do that.

444
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:19,243
- Send him off.
 -  So You, take your pick.

445
00:17:19,243 --> 00:17:21,543
- Let So You take her pick.
 -  By the way, it's raining heavily.

446
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:22,913
- You see...
 -  You, get out.

447
00:17:22,913 --> 00:17:25,043
(You, get out!)

448
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:27,013
- She can do that.
 -  That's right.

449
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:28,213
She can do that.

450
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,943
Jong Kook, you need to decide.

451
00:17:29,943 --> 00:17:32,183
- One, two, three.
 -  My goodness.

452
00:17:33,283 --> 00:17:36,083
(Would he choose the passionate Hyo Lyn...)

453
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,287
(or So You who always picks him?)

454
00:17:39,287 --> 00:17:40,313
- Look at Hyo Lyn.
 -  This is difficult.

455
00:17:40,313 --> 00:17:42,113
You can move to the back for a moment.

456
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:45,153
(Hyo Lyn is the second one to get betrayed.)

457
00:17:45,783 --> 00:17:47,543
- Look at So You.
 -  Poor Hyo Lyn.

458
00:17:47,543 --> 00:17:50,083
There's no room for friendship here.

459
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,653
- I'm sorry, Hyo Lyn.
 -  Yes!

460
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,513
It's not that So You likes you. She just wanted to make it funny.

461
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:55,653
(My goodness!)

462
00:17:55,653 --> 00:17:57,013
- Go out for now.
 -  I have to go.

463
00:17:57,013 --> 00:17:59,183
Why are you guys doing this to each other?

464
00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:00,183
Da Som is here.

465
00:18:00,183 --> 00:18:01,213
- I see.
 -  Don't get me wrong.

466
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,983
("Love and War" is not over yet!)

467
00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:04,483
I know for sure she'll go to you again.

468
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:07,213
(Who will Da Som choose?)

469
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:09,443
- Don't go to him.
 -  Think about it carefully, Da Som.

470
00:18:09,443 --> 00:18:10,983
- Good choice.
 -  That's right.

471
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:12,343
He already betrayed me.

472
00:18:12,343 --> 00:18:13,983
- That's right.
 -  I didn't betray you.

473
00:18:13,983 --> 00:18:15,183
Good job!

474
00:18:15,183 --> 00:18:17,543
- Good choice.
 -  Kwang Soo, were you being hopeful?

475
00:18:17,543 --> 00:18:19,483
- No, I wasn't...
 -  You were.

476
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:20,713
What am I supposed to do?

477
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:21,943
You were being hopeful.

478
00:18:21,943 --> 00:18:23,013
He's too much to handle.

479
00:18:23,483 --> 00:18:24,783
(My gosh!)

480
00:18:24,783 --> 00:18:26,083
He does that.

481
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:29,313
(Hyo Lyn is back after getting betrayed by Jong Kook.)

482
00:18:29,313 --> 00:18:30,513
We're going to go like this.

483
00:18:30,513 --> 00:18:32,680
- Welcome back.
 -  This is what happened.

484
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,443
(Did you think you'd be fine after betraying me?)

485
00:18:35,443 --> 00:18:37,083
(Swallowing)

486
00:18:39,283 --> 00:18:42,713
I feel bad to sit next to someone else now.

487
00:18:42,713 --> 00:18:45,013
No, don't feel bad. We're not like that.

488
00:18:45,613 --> 00:18:48,183
If you've made up your mind, please take your pick.

489
00:18:48,883 --> 00:18:49,883
Five.

490
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:51,113
(Hyo Lyn has to make up her mind.)

491
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:55,813
(Which one of these guys will she save?)

492
00:18:55,813 --> 00:18:58,443
(Would it be another "Love and War"?)

493
00:18:58,443 --> 00:18:59,513
One.

494
00:19:00,513 --> 00:19:03,343
(Hyo Lyn chooses Gary.)

495
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:04,343
One.

496
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,313
(Hyo Lyn chooses Gary.)

497
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,943
(These are the couples headed to Chuncheon.)

498
00:19:07,943 --> 00:19:09,313
I feel like I have everything I need to win.

499
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:13,653
(Seok Jin and Haha are the male couple.)

500
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,383
(Gary and Hyo Lyn are loveable.)

501
00:19:16,383 --> 00:19:19,153
(Jae Seok and Da Som talk over their pain.)

502
00:19:19,153 --> 00:19:21,483
(Jong Kook and So You look strong.)

503
00:19:21,483 --> 00:19:24,383
(Shownu and Ji Hyo only have eyes for each other.)

504
00:19:24,383 --> 00:19:26,613
(Kwang Soo and Bo Ra won't betray each other again.)

505
00:19:27,653 --> 00:19:30,713
(The Best Couple's Trip starts now!)

506
00:19:30,713 --> 00:19:33,283
Each couple will play different games...

507
00:19:33,283 --> 00:19:36,483
- on the trip and earn points.
 -  Really?

508
00:19:36,483 --> 00:19:40,543
You'll use the points to buy items...

509
00:19:40,543 --> 00:19:44,243
that'll be useful in the last mission.

510
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,243
- That's why you need points.
 -  We'll win in the games.

511
00:19:47,243 --> 00:19:49,413
(The winning couple will earn diamond rings.)

512
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:52,543
(They are headed to Chuncheon with their spirits high.)

513
00:19:52,543 --> 00:19:55,783
Heavy rain continues to pour in the capital and the Gangwon area.

514
00:19:55,783 --> 00:19:58,813
Heavy rain in the central districts will continue into the night.

515
00:19:58,813 --> 00:20:02,321
It continues to pour in the central districts.

516
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:04,683
It's pouring outside...

517
00:20:04,683 --> 00:20:08,083
so we're going to have to change our plan.

518
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:11,613
(We'll make sure Kwang Soo receives his prize for calling first.)

519
00:20:11,613 --> 00:20:13,713
(Maybe it's raining a lot because Kwang Soo won.)

520
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,883
We're going to play our first game.

521
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:18,413
We're going to play the "How Many People?" game...

522
00:20:18,413 --> 00:20:20,483
- to test your teamwork.
 -  That's a good one.

523
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:21,843
- Good one.
 -  It's simple, too.

524
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:25,653
- You'll get one point if you win.
 -  Is that so?

525
00:20:25,653 --> 00:20:27,913
You have to open the magazine to a random page...

526
00:20:27,913 --> 00:20:31,813
and the couple that gets the page with the most number of people wins.

527
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,187
It only counts if their eyes, nose and lips show.

528
00:20:34,187 --> 00:20:36,013
- All right. One, two, three.
 -  She shouldn't have picked him.

529
00:20:36,013 --> 00:20:37,190
I know.

530
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,653
There are four people!

531
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:41,013
You got four people. Kwang Soo's team has four.

532
00:20:41,013 --> 00:20:42,213
That's a lot.

533
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:44,043
- All right. One, two, three.
 -  One, two, three.

534
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,413
There's three people!

535
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:46,443
- There's three.
 -  Look at that.

536
00:20:46,443 --> 00:20:48,413
- I've seen this before.
 -  He flipped to the same page as me.

537
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,413
- It's by chance.
 -  Pass it over behind you.

538
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:52,613
- I hope you fail!
 -  Because...

539
00:20:52,613 --> 00:20:54,113
- One, two, three.
 -  One, two, three.

540
00:20:54,113 --> 00:20:55,317
Come on!

541
00:20:55,317 --> 00:20:56,383
- That's two people!
 -  That's two!

542
00:20:56,383 --> 00:20:58,030
That's the page you flipped to.

543
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,713
We have three. Look.

544
00:20:59,713 --> 00:21:00,813
Yes, there are three.

545
00:21:00,813 --> 00:21:02,187
Look here, it's four!

546
00:21:02,187 --> 00:21:03,313
- That's amazing.
 -  You can see the face.

547
00:21:03,313 --> 00:21:04,713
- Look at these people.
 -  That's amazing.

548
00:21:04,713 --> 00:21:06,543
- No, that doesn't count.
 -  These are people.

549
00:21:06,543 --> 00:21:08,113
- You can't see it clearly.
 -  Those are people.

550
00:21:08,113 --> 00:21:09,343
You have to accept this.

551
00:21:09,343 --> 00:21:11,483
- You have to.
 -  You can't see the facial features.

552
00:21:11,483 --> 00:21:12,883
You think they don't have eyes, nose and mouth?

553
00:21:12,883 --> 00:21:15,013
- You think they don't?
 -  You can't see them.

554
00:21:15,013 --> 00:21:16,313
You don't know about that.

555
00:21:16,313 --> 00:21:18,413
- What are you talking about?
 -  You never know.

556
00:21:18,413 --> 00:21:19,913
How many is it, then?

557
00:21:19,913 --> 00:21:22,383
- Use the same magazine.
 -  It's 4, 4, and 3 people.

558
00:21:22,383 --> 00:21:25,413
- We had so many.
 -  When I count down...

559
00:21:25,413 --> 00:21:29,083
- I hope you fail!
 -  I hope you get one person.

560
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,797
- I hope you get one in total.
 -  Wish me good luck.

561
00:21:30,797 --> 00:21:31,883
It's the same page.

562
00:21:31,883 --> 00:21:33,783
- That's 2, then!
 -  There's 1 and 2.

563
00:21:33,783 --> 00:21:36,683
- It's the same page as Gary.
 -  I told you to let it go.

564
00:21:36,683 --> 00:21:38,513
- No way.
 -  Serves you right!

565
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:40,113
- Da Som did so well.
 -  It's three for all of us.

566
00:21:40,113 --> 00:21:41,783
- It's 3, 3, and 3.
 -  I feel bad.

567
00:21:41,783 --> 00:21:43,243
All right. One, two, three.

568
00:21:43,243 --> 00:21:44,883
(What about Ji Hyo and Shownu?)

569
00:21:44,883 --> 00:21:45,883
- That's three people.
 -  That's three!

570
00:21:45,883 --> 00:21:47,043
- It's three again.
 -  My goodness.

571
00:21:47,043 --> 00:21:50,183
- Four people is the highest.
 -  This is pretty difficult.

572
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,483
Haha and Seok Jin will go last.

573
00:21:52,983 --> 00:21:54,383
- Don't do that!
 -  One, two, three.

574
00:21:55,683 --> 00:21:56,683
(Wow!)

575
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:57,683
How many is this?

576
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,043
(It's filled with people.)

577
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:00,943
Move away!

578
00:22:01,413 --> 00:22:02,413
Move!

579
00:22:02,413 --> 00:22:03,683
(This is who I am!)

580
00:22:03,683 --> 00:22:05,183
(He summons a crowd with his lucky hands.)

581
00:22:05,183 --> 00:22:07,127
- We're the best!
 -  How did that happen?

582
00:22:07,127 --> 00:22:09,043
- That's me!
 -  Thumbs up!

583
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:10,713
- That's jackpot.
 -  Give me my point.

584
00:22:10,713 --> 00:22:12,013
It's the jackpot.

585
00:22:12,013 --> 00:22:13,043
It's 20 at least.

586
00:22:13,043 --> 00:22:14,713
- I knew it.
 -  It's over a dozen.

587
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:17,000
(Here comes the second game!)

588
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,713
- Let's play the second game.
 -  Let's go.

589
00:22:19,143 --> 00:22:22,713
One of the couples will come out to the isle.

590
00:22:22,713 --> 00:22:26,013
One of them will sit at the front and try not to laugh.

591
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:27,913
The other couples will try to make them laugh.

592
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:31,183
The couple that lasts the longest will get two points.

593
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,183
(In the "Don't Laugh" game, you must not laugh for one minute.)

594
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:33,513
This is not a funny situation.

595
00:22:33,513 --> 00:22:35,183
- Everybody's upset.
 -  They won't laugh.

596
00:22:35,183 --> 00:22:36,483
- You should go first.
 -  I'm good at this.

597
00:22:36,483 --> 00:22:37,683
- You can go first.
 -  Go ahead.

598
00:22:37,683 --> 00:22:39,213
(The others will try to make them laugh after five seconds.)

599
00:22:39,213 --> 00:22:41,013
Get set. Go.

600
00:22:41,683 --> 00:22:42,713
Get lost.

601
00:22:43,443 --> 00:22:44,843
Get out of my sight.

602
00:22:45,343 --> 00:22:46,413
Why do you hate me?

603
00:22:47,113 --> 00:22:48,713
You're old and useless.

604
00:22:48,713 --> 00:22:50,843
(Old and useless?)

605
00:22:51,243 --> 00:22:53,413
(You're old and useless.)

606
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,083
(Chuckling)

607
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,713
- My gosh.
 -  He laughed.

608
00:22:56,713 --> 00:22:58,183
- He laughed.
 -  It's done.

609
00:22:58,183 --> 00:23:00,443
(Haha made Seok Jin laugh.)

610
00:23:00,443 --> 00:23:01,513
(Seok Jin couldn't help but chuckle at the insult.)

611
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,583
- You're done.
 -  Move over.

612
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,043
- Time's over.
 -  Hey!

613
00:23:04,043 --> 00:23:05,313
I didn't laugh.

614
00:23:05,313 --> 00:23:06,907
- Move over.
 -  Come on.

615
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:08,443
(Seok Jin and Haha made themselves lose.)

616
00:23:08,783 --> 00:23:10,083
I'll give you five seconds right away.

617
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,713
- One.
 -  You start in five seconds.

618
00:23:11,713 --> 00:23:13,713
Get set. Go.

619
00:23:14,113 --> 00:23:16,443
How are you doing, Ji Hyo?

620
00:23:17,213 --> 00:23:18,543
- Five,
 -  Ji Hyo doesn't care.

621
00:23:18,543 --> 00:23:20,943
- four, three...
 -  I hope you're happy.

622
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:22,234
(Ji Hyo turns serious as soon as the timer starts.)

623
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,483
One.

624
00:23:23,483 --> 00:23:25,283
Do you think those glasses suit you?

625
00:23:25,283 --> 00:23:26,343
(Do you think those glasses suit you?)

626
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:28,443
- How do I make her laugh?
 -  Ji Hyo.

627
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,383
- Ji Hyo.
 -  Yes?

628
00:23:30,383 --> 00:23:31,983
Seok Jin actually likes you.

629
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:33,813
(Seok Jin actually likes you.)

630
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,283
(Chuckling)

631
00:23:36,283 --> 00:23:40,883
(Seok Jin loves all the members.)

632
00:23:40,883 --> 00:23:42,713
(She can't stand it.)

633
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,083
- Good one.
 -  That came out of nowhere.

634
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,383
(Ji Hyo laughs in eight seconds.)

635
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,813
- What am I going to do?
 -  Have a seat.

636
00:23:47,813 --> 00:23:49,313
- You can do it.
 -  Get set. Go.

637
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,163
Get yourself into it.

638
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,243
I chose you to make Da Som jealous.

639
00:23:54,243 --> 00:23:55,913
(I chose you to make Da Som jealous.)

640
00:23:55,913 --> 00:23:57,683
I chose you to make Da Som jealous.

641
00:23:57,683 --> 00:23:59,713
(What is he saying?)

642
00:24:00,213 --> 00:24:01,213
(That was unexpected.)

643
00:24:01,213 --> 00:24:02,283
I knew that was right.

644
00:24:02,283 --> 00:24:03,283
(That was unexpected.)

645
00:24:03,283 --> 00:24:04,513
(She's about to burst.)

646
00:24:04,513 --> 00:24:05,513
I can see her smiling.

647
00:24:06,013 --> 00:24:08,143
- Why are you laughing?
 -  They're done.

648
00:24:08,143 --> 00:24:09,913
Hey, that's not supposed to be funny!

649
00:24:09,913 --> 00:24:11,443
- Doesn't that make you mad?
 -  That was too much.

650
00:24:11,443 --> 00:24:13,113
- That was too funny.
 -  Hey!

651
00:24:13,113 --> 00:24:14,583
- They're done.
 -  Doesn't that make you mad?

652
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,183
- You're done.
 -  Kwang Soo!

653
00:24:16,183 --> 00:24:18,413
- What? You were supposed to focus.
 -  That was too funny.

654
00:24:19,313 --> 00:24:21,073
Let's break up. Don't call me ever again.

655
00:24:21,073 --> 00:24:22,900
Seok Jin really likes you.

656
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,913
- You're not lady-like.
 -  Kwang Soo betrayed you.

657
00:24:24,913 --> 00:24:26,120
Will you marry me?

658
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,083
- Your hair smells like poop.
 -  Really?

659
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,713
Hyo Lyn and Da Som's team both win.

660
00:24:31,713 --> 00:24:33,083
- Yes!
 -  Yes!

661
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,483
(Both teams earn two points.)

662
00:24:34,483 --> 00:24:36,413
- I knew it!
 -  We finally have some points.

663
00:24:36,413 --> 00:24:38,983
We're getting off. We're already at Chuncheon Station.

664
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:43,483
(The rain picks up.)

665
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:46,643
(Chuncheon is covered in rain.)

666
00:24:47,283 --> 00:24:48,313
My gosh.

667
00:24:48,683 --> 00:24:49,713
The rain...

668
00:24:49,713 --> 00:24:50,943
(Would they be able to finish their trip?)

669
00:24:50,943 --> 00:24:52,613
It would have been good if it didn't rain. It's pouring.

670
00:24:52,613 --> 00:24:53,813
(Would they be able to finish their trip?)

671
00:24:53,813 --> 00:24:56,380
- Is Chuncheon having the most rain?
 -  That's right.

672
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,613
It's raining so much right now.

673
00:24:58,613 --> 00:24:59,983
It's raining a lot.

674
00:25:02,443 --> 00:25:05,083
- This is no joke.
 -  I know.

675
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:07,483
It's quite scary.

676
00:25:08,483 --> 00:25:12,013
It would have been a great trip if it didn't rain.

677
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:15,983
(This is how a trip to Chuncheon looks like.)

678
00:25:16,713 --> 00:25:19,343
(It sure makes you excited.)

679
00:25:21,343 --> 00:25:24,113
(You're supposed to go on a date on bicycles.)

680
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:26,543
We can't go on a trip in this rain.

681
00:25:27,043 --> 00:25:29,013
How were we supposed to play a game in the pool?

682
00:25:29,813 --> 00:25:31,883
(We don't even know.)

683
00:25:34,883 --> 00:25:37,443
(We have a lot prepared but you can't have them.)

684
00:25:40,383 --> 00:25:42,143
(We'll save this for another time.)

685
00:25:42,943 --> 00:25:45,043
(When is Running Man coming?)

686
00:25:47,443 --> 00:25:49,343
(There's a sudden change of plans.)

687
00:25:49,943 --> 00:25:52,083
(It's been relocated to an indoor gym.)

688
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:55,583
(Supplies have been gathered last minute.)

689
00:25:56,283 --> 00:25:57,883
(Have you heard of this before?)

690
00:25:58,883 --> 00:26:00,783
(It's an indoor couple's trip.)

691
00:26:00,783 --> 00:26:01,783
- What's this?
 -  What's this?

692
00:26:01,783 --> 00:26:04,043
- What's going on?
 -  Wow!

693
00:26:04,043 --> 00:26:06,213
- This is so nice.
 -  This is what it's about.

694
00:26:06,213 --> 00:26:07,813
- This is exciting.
 -  Sit here.

695
00:26:07,813 --> 00:26:09,283
You're supposed to sit in a circle on a couple's trip.

696
00:26:09,283 --> 00:26:10,813
We're the only team without any points.

697
00:26:10,813 --> 00:26:13,483
- Let me see...
 -  You have zero point.

698
00:26:13,483 --> 00:26:15,593
- We're first place.
 -  We have two points.

699
00:26:15,593 --> 00:26:16,843
Sit next to your partner.

700
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:18,183
- Sure.
 -  Next to your partner?

701
00:26:18,183 --> 00:26:21,043
It's a joint couple's trip.

702
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:23,013
Some of you know each other...

703
00:26:23,013 --> 00:26:25,413
- but let's introduce ourselves.
 -  Sure.

704
00:26:25,413 --> 00:26:27,643
- Let's start from the right.
 -  Go ahead.

705
00:26:27,643 --> 00:26:30,583
We've been going out for 7 years. Is it 6 years?

706
00:26:31,113 --> 00:26:33,143
It's been six years and it was love at first sight.

707
00:26:33,143 --> 00:26:34,283
We're in platonic relationship.

708
00:26:34,283 --> 00:26:36,743
- You look good together.
 -  Sorry to interrupt you two,

709
00:26:36,743 --> 00:26:38,083
but you're not on a honeymoon.

710
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,083
- What?
 -  That was kind of too much.

711
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:42,583
- It's just a trip.
 -  No, it was too much.

712
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:44,413
- Isn't this a couple's trip?
 -  It doesn't mean we're all married.

713
00:26:44,413 --> 00:26:45,920
(This is a couple's trip, but not for married couples.)

714
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,303
- Anyway, hi.
 -  Good to see you all.

715
00:26:47,303 --> 00:26:49,113
- Hello.
 -  All right. Next couple please.

716
00:26:49,113 --> 00:26:51,313
You two didn't want to become a couple at first.

717
00:26:51,313 --> 00:26:52,843
- I like my partner.
 -  Me too.

718
00:26:52,843 --> 00:26:56,513
Hi. I'm Gary Kang, the dancing king of Jamsil.

719
00:26:57,243 --> 00:26:58,313
- The dancing king.
 -  The dancing king of Jamsil?

720
00:26:58,313 --> 00:27:01,213
Hey. My partner is the dancing king of Uijeongbu.

721
00:27:01,213 --> 00:27:03,513
- Who are you talking about?
 -  This guy. His name is Shownu.

722
00:27:03,513 --> 00:27:05,613
- Really?
 -  The dancing king of Uijeongbu.

723
00:27:05,613 --> 00:27:06,883
- You can't lose to him.
 -  How about a dancing competition?

724
00:27:06,883 --> 00:27:08,343
- Let's see.
 -  You can't lose to him.

725
00:27:08,343 --> 00:27:10,913
- He's the dancing king of Jamsil.
 -  Okay. That's enough I think.

726
00:27:10,913 --> 00:27:12,583
- Okay, I am...
 -  Everybody knows this guy.

727
00:27:13,113 --> 00:27:15,243
As you already know, I am the faculty representative.

728
00:27:15,243 --> 00:27:16,520
Why are you the representative?

729
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,843
- Why are you the representative?
 -  I just am.

730
00:27:18,843 --> 00:27:20,513
- Let him take the title.
 -  This time, I will...

731
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,813
- The title suits him.
 -  But everybody ignores him.

732
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:23,983
- Anyway...
 -  Are you good at dancing?

733
00:27:23,983 --> 00:27:26,383
My partner, Da Som falls in love really easily.

734
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:28,500
- Does she?
 -  Yes, very easily.

735
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,330
If someone likes her,

736
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,583
she is attracted to the person without knowing.

737
00:27:33,043 --> 00:27:35,213
- So please be cautious.
 -  No flirting, please.

738
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:36,713
- Be cautious.
 -  No flirting, please.

739
00:27:37,043 --> 00:27:39,017
(I mean, you!)

740
00:27:39,017 --> 00:27:40,713
- No way.
 -  You shouldn't.

741
00:27:40,713 --> 00:27:42,443
- No, I mean...
 -  You stay away from her.

742
00:27:42,443 --> 00:27:44,213
I may fall in love unconsciously.

743
00:27:45,643 --> 00:27:47,143
(I'll make you my man, Kwang Soo.)

744
00:27:47,143 --> 00:27:48,383
That was really nice.

745
00:27:48,383 --> 00:27:50,700
- You look excited.
 -  No, I'm not.

746
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,883
- He's excited.
 -  I'm not.

747
00:27:52,883 --> 00:27:54,043
You guys are tall.

748
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:55,883
They look scary.

749
00:27:56,583 --> 00:27:58,643
I'm Jong Kook from Anyang.

750
00:27:59,683 --> 00:28:00,783
I love to exercise.

751
00:28:01,343 --> 00:28:02,343
- What?
 -  Yes, you heard me.

752
00:28:02,343 --> 00:28:03,843
I bet you love to fight, not to exercise.

753
00:28:04,813 --> 00:28:07,083
I'm So You from Cheongdamdong.

754
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:08,683
Hey, you are from Jeju Island.

755
00:28:08,683 --> 00:28:10,043
Jeju Island sounds weird.

756
00:28:10,043 --> 00:28:11,713
Where she lives now is the important thing.

757
00:28:11,713 --> 00:28:14,763
- Where she was born is not.
 -  I live in Cheongdamdong now.

758
00:28:14,763 --> 00:28:16,413
I love to exercise, too.

759
00:28:16,413 --> 00:28:17,783
You guys make a good couple.

760
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:19,143
So...

761
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:21,783
we'll make your life difficult if you get in our way.

762
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,313
(We'll make your life difficult if you get in our way.)

763
00:28:23,713 --> 00:28:24,943
(Gosh!)

764
00:28:24,943 --> 00:28:25,943
(I'm not joking.)

765
00:28:25,943 --> 00:28:28,043
- She's bold.
 -  I was really surprised.

766
00:28:28,043 --> 00:28:29,443
She really surprised me. I must be careful.

767
00:28:29,443 --> 00:28:31,783
We'll collect many points...

768
00:28:31,783 --> 00:28:33,343
and secure the diamond ring.

769
00:28:33,343 --> 00:28:35,513
- No way.
 -  You...

770
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:36,713
- Here come the player.
 -  Hi, everyone.

771
00:28:36,713 --> 00:28:37,783
They are both players.

772
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:40,090
My name is Kwang Soo. I'm from Namyangju.

773
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,713
He's keep looking at Da Som.

774
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:44,676
- What are you saying?
 -  Stop looking at her.

775
00:28:44,676 --> 00:28:47,043
But Da Som is also looking at him.

776
00:28:47,043 --> 00:28:48,043
Hey!

777
00:28:48,513 --> 00:28:50,413
- Hey.
 -  I told you not to do that.

778
00:28:50,413 --> 00:28:51,443
What are they doing?

779
00:28:52,013 --> 00:28:53,243
A nonsense love story, I guess.

780
00:28:53,243 --> 00:28:55,243
I'm afraid that they might fight sometime today.

781
00:28:55,243 --> 00:28:58,843
- No way.
 -  Am I watching "Love and War" now?

782
00:28:59,213 --> 00:29:01,683
- That guy is handsome.
 -  He really is.

783
00:29:01,683 --> 00:29:03,013
- He's new to this show.
 -  It's good...

784
00:29:03,013 --> 00:29:05,083
- to see someone handsome here.
 -  He has many charms.

785
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,143
I envy you.

786
00:29:06,143 --> 00:29:08,383
I am Ji Hyo, and I'm from Hongdae.

787
00:29:09,143 --> 00:29:12,543
And my partner is extremely quiet.

788
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:15,243
- Talk to us. Would you?
 -  I am... Hi.

789
00:29:17,483 --> 00:29:19,813
I think I'm talking a lot today,

790
00:29:19,813 --> 00:29:21,583
but everyone is asking me to talk.

791
00:29:22,283 --> 00:29:24,683
- Do you think you're talking a lot?
 -  You will talk more before you go.

792
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:28,856
I wish to become a more entertaining person today.

793
00:29:28,856 --> 00:29:31,613
- Do you know what's really funny?
 -  What?

794
00:29:31,613 --> 00:29:33,483
If someone is quite like him, people tend to look at him more.

795
00:29:33,483 --> 00:29:35,543
- You're right.
 -  It's interesting how that happens.

796
00:29:35,543 --> 00:29:36,783
- I'm sure.
 -  It's really strange.

797
00:29:36,783 --> 00:29:39,783
- I get curious if someone is quiet.
 -  That's what happens.

798
00:29:39,783 --> 00:29:41,714
- No matter how the guy looks?
 -  That doesn't matter.

799
00:29:41,714 --> 00:29:43,550
Of course, there are some exceptions.

800
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,413
Why are you pointing at me while saying that?

801
00:29:46,043 --> 00:29:47,200
(Because you are one of the exceptions.)

802
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,013
- All right. We'll play you a music.
 -  Okay.

803
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,183
Since we have our representative with us,

804
00:29:52,183 --> 00:29:54,583
- he will give you chances.
 -  Okay.

805
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:57,383
One of our staff members will choose the best dancing couple.

806
00:29:57,383 --> 00:30:01,014
- Really?
 -  We'll give them one point.

807
00:30:01,014 --> 00:30:02,043
- Wow.
 -  Da som.

808
00:30:03,443 --> 00:30:05,083
(The competition will start off with Sistar's dance.)

809
00:30:12,483 --> 00:30:13,483
(Swaying)

810
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,813
(They are so nice...)

811
00:30:19,243 --> 00:30:20,283
(and sexy, too.)

812
00:30:20,283 --> 00:30:21,343
That's amazing.

813
00:30:22,543 --> 00:30:24,483
(Sistar rules the summer.)

814
00:30:24,483 --> 00:30:26,683
(Sistar rules today's trip, too.)

815
00:30:28,113 --> 00:30:29,380
Nice.

816
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,283
- You're the best.
 -  That was really nice.

817
00:30:31,813 --> 00:30:33,643
- They have something different.
 -  They do. Really.

818
00:30:33,643 --> 00:30:35,813
Okay. Please start the music.

819
00:30:37,213 --> 00:30:38,643
(The music starts.)

820
00:30:39,143 --> 00:30:40,443
This is the song for Shownu.

821
00:30:42,783 --> 00:30:44,513
(The couples are warming up.)

822
00:30:46,113 --> 00:30:47,183
(He's all excited.)

823
00:30:47,983 --> 00:30:49,013
(Jae Seok is absorbed in dancing.)

824
00:30:49,743 --> 00:30:50,743
(Even his partner doesn't like him dancing.)

825
00:30:50,743 --> 00:30:52,183
Stop moving around.

826
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,643
(They are really shocked.)

827
00:30:54,843 --> 00:30:56,576
(I am your representative!)

828
00:30:56,576 --> 00:30:58,343
He is completely out of rhythm.

829
00:30:58,743 --> 00:31:00,943
I'm just warming up. Warm yourselves up, everyone.

830
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,127
You're doing good.

831
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:03,913
All right. Haha and Seok Jin, it's your turn.

832
00:31:03,913 --> 00:31:05,113
(Haha and Seok Jin are the first.)

833
00:31:06,343 --> 00:31:07,443
- I'll give you three seconds.
 -  My gosh.

834
00:31:09,213 --> 00:31:10,413
(That's disgusting.)

835
00:31:11,443 --> 00:31:12,743
- My gosh.
 -  What are you doing?

836
00:31:12,743 --> 00:31:14,813
I guess you guys were too excited. You get a warning.

837
00:31:14,813 --> 00:31:16,283
- No, I mean...
 -  This is your first warning.

838
00:31:16,283 --> 00:31:18,297
- My partner is tough.
 -  Next time, you're out.

839
00:31:18,297 --> 00:31:20,213
All right. Please start the music.

840
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,613
(Gary and Hyo Lyn are the second.)

841
00:31:23,283 --> 00:31:25,683
- It's your turn, Gary.
 -  He loves this kind of music.

842
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:27,243
Go, Gary.

843
00:31:27,813 --> 00:31:28,976
(Join me, Hyo Lyn.)

844
00:31:28,976 --> 00:31:30,843
Go for it, Gary.

845
00:31:31,883 --> 00:31:32,983
(Goodness!)

846
00:31:36,013 --> 00:31:37,950
(How can she dance like that?)

847
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,483
- Wow.
 -  How is she doing that?

848
00:31:39,813 --> 00:31:42,213
- How could she do that?
 -  How can she dance like that?

849
00:31:44,183 --> 00:31:45,343
- What's this?
 -  What are you doing?

850
00:31:45,743 --> 00:31:47,656
- Gosh.
 -  What are they doing?

851
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:48,743
Wait. Stop.

852
00:31:49,183 --> 00:31:50,513
- Why?
 -  What are you doing?

853
00:31:50,513 --> 00:31:52,313
- What are you doing right now?
 -  Why did you stop us?

854
00:31:52,313 --> 00:31:54,613
- Why?
 -  Please stop for a minute.

855
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,983
- Why?
 -  What's wrong with you?

856
00:31:56,983 --> 00:31:58,813
We were enjoying it. Why did you stop us?

857
00:31:59,413 --> 00:32:01,113
- What were you thinking?
 -  What's wrong?

858
00:32:01,783 --> 00:32:04,013
- You two get a warning, too.
 -  A warning?

859
00:32:04,013 --> 00:32:06,270
- Why? What's wrong?
 -  You get a warning.

860
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,773
- You get a warning.
 -  We didn't do anything wrong.

861
00:32:08,773 --> 00:32:11,213
- We're just college students.
 -  I think that was acceptable.

862
00:32:11,213 --> 00:32:14,513
- All right.
 -  That was really something.

863
00:32:14,513 --> 00:32:16,013
All right. Please start the music again.

864
00:32:16,013 --> 00:32:17,013
Please start the music.

865
00:32:18,613 --> 00:32:20,183
Kwang Soo and Bo Ra. It's your turn now.

866
00:32:20,183 --> 00:32:22,443
What should we do? What should we do?

867
00:32:23,413 --> 00:32:25,783
- What is she doing?
 -  What are they doing now?

868
00:32:26,343 --> 00:32:28,507
- What is this?
 -  Hey, what are you doing? Stop.

869
00:32:28,507 --> 00:32:29,513
What happened?

870
00:32:30,013 --> 00:32:31,783
- Hey!
 -  What's wrong with you?

871
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,543
- No, we were trying to...
 -  You saw others getting a warning.

872
00:32:33,543 --> 00:32:35,113
- You must be crazy.
 -  What are you thinking?

873
00:32:35,113 --> 00:32:37,283
- Are you crazy?
 -  We planned to do something.

874
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:38,583
- Are you crazy?
 -  What's wrong with you?

875
00:32:39,283 --> 00:32:40,703
We were trying to do that spinning thing...

876
00:32:40,703 --> 00:32:42,983
- Take him out.
 -  You are mad.

877
00:32:42,983 --> 00:32:45,313
- What's your problem?
 -  Get out. Get out.

878
00:32:45,313 --> 00:32:47,013
- No, I mean...
 -  What's wrong with you?

879
00:32:48,613 --> 00:32:49,683
(This is unfair.)

880
00:32:49,683 --> 00:32:51,807
All right, everyone. Let's try that again.

881
00:32:51,807 --> 00:32:53,983
- That was so funny.
 -  Something's wrong with the music.

882
00:32:53,983 --> 00:32:56,613
- The music is provocative.
 -  The music is the problem.

883
00:32:56,613 --> 00:32:58,943
- That music inspired me.
 -  Please play something different.

884
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:01,343
Can you play a more cheerful music instead?

885
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,813
(Jae Seok and Da Som are the fourth.)

886
00:33:07,343 --> 00:33:09,243
(Da Som is cute...)

887
00:33:09,243 --> 00:33:10,243
(and Jae Seok is frivolous.)

888
00:33:10,243 --> 00:33:12,383
- Look at him.
 -  Hey, this isn't a nightclub.

889
00:33:12,383 --> 00:33:14,143
He's enjoying it. Really.

890
00:33:14,713 --> 00:33:16,413
- What's wrong with you?
 -  When will you stop dancing?

891
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:19,183
- Look at him. What is he doing?
 -  What's wrong with him?

892
00:33:19,613 --> 00:33:21,856
- You're blocking the camera.
 -  What is that?

893
00:33:21,856 --> 00:33:25,513
- Here comes Shownu.
 -  Go, Shownu. Go, Shownu.

894
00:33:25,513 --> 00:33:27,243
- Show us your moves, Shownu.
 -  Go for it.

895
00:33:28,713 --> 00:33:29,783
(Splendid dance moves)

896
00:33:30,543 --> 00:33:31,543
(The dancing king of Uijeongbu)

897
00:33:32,313 --> 00:33:33,313
(It's your turn, Ji Hyo.)

898
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:37,683
She's so cute.

899
00:33:38,113 --> 00:33:39,683
- That's nice, Ji Hyo.
 -  Wow.

900
00:33:40,383 --> 00:33:42,280
(Jong Kook and So You are the last.)

901
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,583
- They look scary.
 -  Just by looking at them...

902
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:47,583
- I feel scared.
 -  Are they dancing or sparring?

903
00:33:50,043 --> 00:33:51,383
(She stops.)

904
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:54,343
- What are they doing?
 -  They are waiting for something.

905
00:33:54,343 --> 00:33:55,713
Let's interrupt them during the highlight.

906
00:33:55,713 --> 00:33:57,683
- It's the highlight.
 -  They're waiting.

907
00:33:57,683 --> 00:33:59,443
- No, don't.
 -  While they are waiting,

908
00:33:59,783 --> 00:34:01,613
- get ready to join them.
 -  Be ready.

909
00:34:03,243 --> 00:34:04,583
(They're all waiting for the beat like hyenas.)

910
00:34:07,183 --> 00:34:09,613
(Join in.)

911
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,053
(They are all dancing like crazy.)

912
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:17,913
Are you okay, Hyo Lyn?

913
00:34:17,913 --> 00:34:20,183
Look at Da Som. She's good.

914
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:22,743
- This is fun.
 -  Look at that camera.

915
00:34:26,513 --> 00:34:27,913
(So You doesn't care about winning any more.)

916
00:34:28,343 --> 00:34:30,913
- We must win this time.
 -  Well done, Da Som.

917
00:34:30,913 --> 00:34:32,173
Well done.

918
00:34:32,173 --> 00:34:33,513
You danced really well in front of the camera.

919
00:34:33,513 --> 00:34:35,783
We would've won if we showed our trick.

920
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:37,913
- Teamwork must come first.
 -  Yes. Teamwork.

921
00:34:37,913 --> 00:34:39,383
Teamwork must come first.

922
00:34:39,383 --> 00:34:40,713
How you felt is the most important.

923
00:34:40,713 --> 00:34:44,183
Which is the best dancing couple for today?

924
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:45,613
- The best couple is...
 -  Yes?

925
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:48,113
They are on a roll. Literally.

926
00:34:49,183 --> 00:34:50,553
(This is what we were trying to do.)

927
00:34:50,553 --> 00:34:52,743
- That looks tough.
 -  It hurts if you do it that way.

928
00:34:52,743 --> 00:34:55,590
- Their heights are way different.
 -  That won't work.

929
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,713
Which couple is the best?

930
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:58,783
It's Seok Jin and Haha couple.

931
00:34:58,783 --> 00:35:00,053
(Seok Jin and Haha make the best couple.)

932
00:35:00,743 --> 00:35:02,370
- Really?
 -  Are you serious?

933
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:04,773
- Why couldn't we dance then?
 -  No way.

934
00:35:04,773 --> 00:35:07,080
- How could they be?
 -  No way.

935
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,483
How could you choose these two?

936
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:10,553
- I knew I could count on her.
 -  I knew it.

937
00:35:10,553 --> 00:35:12,053
- Well done.
 -  What did I do wrong to her?

938
00:35:12,053 --> 00:35:14,213
- Then we could've won instead.
 -  No way.

939
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:16,983
She's really good. She is.

940
00:35:16,983 --> 00:35:19,643
That's unfair. Don't you think so?

941
00:35:20,213 --> 00:35:22,143
- Oh well. Anyway,
 -  All right. Let's move on.

942
00:35:22,143 --> 00:35:26,243
For Gary and Hyo Lyn, their managers must make sure...

943
00:35:26,243 --> 00:35:28,513
they get back home. Make sure they don't dance on their way.

944
00:35:28,513 --> 00:35:31,120
- Seriously.
 -  I mean it.

945
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,513
They were so excited.

946
00:35:32,513 --> 00:35:35,813
- You're too open-minded.
 -  It's raining really hard.

947
00:35:35,813 --> 00:35:38,213
I never knew that Hyo Lyn will get close with Gary like this.

948
00:35:39,183 --> 00:35:43,143
(Point Board: Kwang Soo and Bo Ra are the first with four points.)

949
00:35:43,783 --> 00:35:46,943
All right, everyone. This time, you will play "Leg Wrestling".

950
00:35:46,943 --> 00:35:48,183
- What is it about?
 -  "Leg Wrestling"?

951
00:35:48,183 --> 00:35:49,783
- Couples will play against others.
 -  Okay.

952
00:35:50,143 --> 00:35:53,213
- Jong Kook will win.
 -  We have won already.

953
00:35:53,883 --> 00:35:55,783
- Do we have to hang on there?
 -  There's no hope.

954
00:35:57,443 --> 00:35:59,343
- Good luck, Da Som.
 -  Go, Hyo Lyn.

955
00:35:59,343 --> 00:36:01,783
- You can win.
 -  Let's go.

956
00:36:01,783 --> 00:36:02,970
- Are you ready?
 -  Yes.

957
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,013
Ready...

958
00:36:04,013 --> 00:36:05,053
(The game starts.)

959
00:36:07,813 --> 00:36:08,843
(Climbing)

960
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:12,113
(Da Som has got the upper hand.)

961
00:36:13,343 --> 00:36:14,553
(However, Jae Seok and Gary are...)

962
00:36:16,243 --> 00:36:17,383
(Gary begins to kick his back.)

963
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,824
(Gary attacks Jae Seok fiercely with his toes.)

964
00:36:18,824 --> 00:36:20,483
Gary is really serious.

965
00:36:21,183 --> 00:36:22,283
(Tickling)

966
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:26,183
(Gary tickles Jae Seok under his arm.)

967
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:29,383
(Jae Seok begins to kick Gary's weak point.)

968
00:36:30,143 --> 00:36:31,813
(Jae Seok pays back for what Gary did.)

969
00:36:33,383 --> 00:36:34,383
Stop it.

970
00:36:34,383 --> 00:36:36,083
I'm not in a good shape down there.

971
00:36:36,913 --> 00:36:38,583
- What's going on?
 -  I'm sorry.

972
00:36:39,183 --> 00:36:40,553
(He drills even harder.)

973
00:36:40,553 --> 00:36:42,053
It really hurts.

974
00:36:43,213 --> 00:36:44,643
What are you doing here?

975
00:36:45,783 --> 00:36:47,553
(We have censored it for your sakes.)

976
00:36:48,053 --> 00:36:49,213
Are you all right, Gary?

977
00:36:49,843 --> 00:36:51,560
- No!
 -  I'm sorry, Gary.

978
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,583
Gary.

979
00:36:56,053 --> 00:36:59,313
(He's getting completely humiliated.)

980
00:37:01,713 --> 00:37:03,143
Do we have to hang onto the bar like this?

981
00:37:05,783 --> 00:37:07,313
(Jae Seok and Gary are both out.)

982
00:37:07,313 --> 00:37:09,573
- It's a fight between you two.
 -  It's between you two.

983
00:37:09,573 --> 00:37:10,997
You humiliated me.

984
00:37:10,997 --> 00:37:12,083
Goodness.

985
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:14,143
What does Gary make everything rated R?

986
00:37:14,883 --> 00:37:16,083
It's because he's rated R.

987
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:17,553
(Gary is a man who's rated R.)

988
00:37:17,553 --> 00:37:18,713
You must be aggressive.

989
00:37:18,713 --> 00:37:19,983
Stop it!

990
00:37:21,243 --> 00:37:23,053
- She turned.
 -  She turned.

991
00:37:24,013 --> 00:37:25,553
(She's determined to stay hanging.)

992
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:27,843
So You, that looks dangerous.

993
00:37:27,843 --> 00:37:30,283
- Look at Da Som.
 -  Wait, Da Som.

994
00:37:30,283 --> 00:37:31,583
(She won't let her win easily.)

995
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,513
- Da Som is quite good.
 -  Wow, Da Som.

996
00:37:38,613 --> 00:37:39,843
What's going on?

997
00:37:40,313 --> 00:37:41,613
(A gravity-defying fight between two warriors)

998
00:37:41,613 --> 00:37:42,783
Da Som, you can do it.

999
00:37:43,413 --> 00:37:44,983
(Even at the Shaolin Temple, )

1000
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:48,113
(at a circus...)

1001
00:37:49,613 --> 00:37:51,883
(or in the jungle, this anti-gravity show would surprise everyone.)

1002
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:55,083
Which legs belong to whom?

1003
00:37:56,313 --> 00:37:57,843
(Da Som is out.)

1004
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:00,120
Are you okay?

1005
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,713
Good job, Hyo Lyn.

1006
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,943
- Hyo Lyn, are you all right?
 -  Are you okay?

1007
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:06,013
That was amazing.

1008
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,813
- Gary's team wins.
 -  Good job.

1009
00:38:09,143 --> 00:38:11,113
- Hyo Lyn.
 -  Gosh, I lost.

1010
00:38:11,113 --> 00:38:12,243
Bo Ra, you should play without shoes.

1011
00:38:12,243 --> 00:38:14,243
- Ji Hyo is really strong.
 -  She is.

1012
00:38:14,243 --> 00:38:15,813
Bo Ra, you also exercise.

1013
00:38:15,813 --> 00:38:17,143
Get ready.

1014
00:38:17,483 --> 00:38:18,757
Hang onto the bar.

1015
00:38:18,757 --> 00:38:20,083
Start.

1016
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:24,213
(Everyone puts their legs up.)

1017
00:38:27,813 --> 00:38:29,114
She's really strong.

1018
00:38:29,114 --> 00:38:30,813
- Bo Ra is in trouble.
 -  She's in trouble.

1019
00:38:31,283 --> 00:38:32,913
- Bo Ra is in trouble.
 -  She's in trouble.

1020
00:38:33,783 --> 00:38:35,783
Are you all right?

1021
00:38:35,783 --> 00:38:37,113
(Ji Hyo and Bo Ra are out simultaneously.)

1022
00:38:37,443 --> 00:38:38,583
Are you all right?

1023
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:40,083
Look at them.

1024
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:41,900
What are they doing?

1025
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,913
He got him.

1026
00:38:43,413 --> 00:38:44,670
(The tables are turned.)

1027
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,683
He's starting to tickle him.

1028
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:47,083
(Tickling)

1029
00:38:47,513 --> 00:38:48,513
(But it doesn't work.)

1030
00:38:48,513 --> 00:38:50,143
(He immediately tries to suffocate him.)

1031
00:38:51,643 --> 00:38:52,683
Stop.

1032
00:38:54,983 --> 00:38:56,970
How will he endure it?

1033
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,083
(He swings his body.)

1034
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:00,843
- That's impressive.
 -  Wow.

1035
00:39:00,843 --> 00:39:02,313
Look at them.

1036
00:39:02,313 --> 00:39:03,713
He's acting like a monkey.

1037
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,013
- You can do it.
 -  Wait.

1038
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:10,343
Kwang Soo, you can do it.

1039
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,083
(He lets go of his mentality.)

1040
00:39:14,283 --> 00:39:15,683
(Poor Kwang Soo.)

1041
00:39:15,683 --> 00:39:17,313
No, Kwang Soo.

1042
00:39:18,013 --> 00:39:19,483
- No, Kwang Soo.
 -  Kwang Soo.

1043
00:39:19,813 --> 00:39:21,143
(But then)

1044
00:39:24,713 --> 00:39:26,284
(His feet land on the floor.)

1045
00:39:26,284 --> 00:39:27,343
They touched the floor!

1046
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,213
(Shownu is out.)

1047
00:39:29,783 --> 00:39:31,313
- Please help me.
 -  Goodness.

1048
00:39:32,343 --> 00:39:33,583
Seriously, this is...

1049
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:34,613
Next team, please.

1050
00:39:34,983 --> 00:39:36,287
Get ready.

1051
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:37,613
I can't even grab the bar.

1052
00:39:37,613 --> 00:39:38,783
I might lose as soon as I start.

1053
00:39:39,613 --> 00:39:40,913
She's exhausted.

1054
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:43,483
(Bo Ra swings her leg.)

1055
00:39:45,343 --> 00:39:46,713
(With a sudden high kick, Hyo Lyn is out.)

1056
00:39:47,743 --> 00:39:49,843
- He spun around.
 -  Are you all right?

1057
00:39:50,713 --> 00:39:51,713
(Kwang Soo spins around.)

1058
00:39:53,483 --> 00:39:55,313
(Kwang Soo spins like a roasted chicken.)

1059
00:39:56,183 --> 00:39:57,513
No, stop!

1060
00:39:57,513 --> 00:39:58,783
(He hits.)

1061
00:39:58,783 --> 00:39:59,913
What is he doing?

1062
00:40:00,313 --> 00:40:01,383
What are you doing?

1063
00:40:01,383 --> 00:40:02,573
What did he do?

1064
00:40:02,573 --> 00:40:03,913
He has a weak back.

1065
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:06,183
(He strives to get on top.)

1066
00:40:06,183 --> 00:40:08,413
Kwang Soo is very determined.

1067
00:40:08,843 --> 00:40:10,243
Kwang Soo, you must win.

1068
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:12,613
(He tries to put pressure on the ribs.)

1069
00:40:14,443 --> 00:40:16,450
(Then, he swings punches.)

1070
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,643
(He gives a rough massage to his bottom.)

1071
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,960
(It's a scary sight.)

1072
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,343
You must win.

1073
00:40:22,743 --> 00:40:23,983
You can also do it.

1074
00:40:24,743 --> 00:40:26,583
(Screaming)

1075
00:40:27,243 --> 00:40:28,483
(The shorts are getting tight.)

1076
00:40:29,183 --> 00:40:31,313
(His wailing keeps getting louder.)

1077
00:40:31,313 --> 00:40:33,313
- You have to endure it, Kwang Soo.
 -  I'm being serious.

1078
00:40:33,313 --> 00:40:34,483
You might fall off.

1079
00:40:34,483 --> 00:40:35,913
I'm being serious.

1080
00:40:35,913 --> 00:40:38,083
- Get off of me.
 -  Twist his leg.

1081
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:39,183
Hold on to his leg tightly.

1082
00:40:39,183 --> 00:40:40,413
I want to go down!

1083
00:40:40,413 --> 00:40:41,413
Come down.

1084
00:40:41,413 --> 00:40:42,943
Gary.

1085
00:40:42,943 --> 00:40:44,743
"I want to go down."

1086
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:46,243
(It's not a proud victory.)

1087
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:47,343
Who's the winner then?

1088
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:49,913
Kwang Soo's team wins.

1089
00:40:50,343 --> 00:40:51,343
What is this?

1090
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,183
Why is there something on my shorts?

1091
00:40:56,183 --> 00:40:57,483
No, Kwang Soo. Don't misunderstand.

1092
00:40:57,483 --> 00:40:58,883
- It's water.
 -  It's just water.

1093
00:40:59,343 --> 00:41:01,143
Good job, Gary.

1094
00:41:01,143 --> 00:41:02,710
- Go back up to the bar.
 -  Okay.

1095
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,783
You'll start...

1096
00:41:03,783 --> 00:41:05,213
- the final round. Get ready.
 -  Kwang Soo.

1097
00:41:06,943 --> 00:41:09,483
(It's Kwang Soo versus Jong Kook, a cheater versus a strong man.)

1098
00:41:09,483 --> 00:41:11,513
(Bo Ra versus So You)

1099
00:41:12,313 --> 00:41:13,883
(Which couple will be the strongest?)

1100
00:41:13,883 --> 00:41:15,183
- I'm too short.
 -  Get ready.

1101
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:17,213
That startled me.

1102
00:41:18,913 --> 00:41:20,213
He can't even attack Jong Kook.

1103
00:41:21,343 --> 00:41:22,843
(It's a brutal attack.)

1104
00:41:23,713 --> 00:41:25,566
- It doesn't work on Jong Kook.
 -  You have to climb on top.

1105
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,313
- It doesn't work.
 -  Goodness.

1106
00:41:27,313 --> 00:41:28,553
(So You attacks first.)

1107
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:36,783
It's okay for you to lose!

1108
00:41:36,783 --> 00:41:38,029
You did it, So You.

1109
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:39,343
(She's flung onto the floor.)

1110
00:41:39,713 --> 00:41:42,343
(I'm the strongest woman in the neighbourhood.)

1111
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:45,083
(Kwang Soo struggles with all his might against Jong Kook.)

1112
00:41:46,283 --> 00:41:47,743
(Getting a point doesn't matter at this moment.)

1113
00:41:47,743 --> 00:41:49,413
(His pride is the only thing that matters.)

1114
00:41:49,783 --> 00:41:51,143
(Kwang Soo, stay strong.)

1115
00:41:52,313 --> 00:41:54,143
(What can he do now?)

1116
00:41:55,843 --> 00:41:56,943
(He punches.)

1117
00:41:58,583 --> 00:41:59,913
(The cheater strikes violently.)

1118
00:42:00,683 --> 00:42:01,713
It's okay for you to lose!

1119
00:42:01,713 --> 00:42:02,783
(He's merciless.)

1120
00:42:03,643 --> 00:42:05,113
He's releasing all of his anger.

1121
00:42:06,683 --> 00:42:08,843
(He delivers uppercuts containing sorrows from the past.)

1122
00:42:09,683 --> 00:42:11,897
Jong Kook has wrestled on the bar many times,

1123
00:42:11,897 --> 00:42:13,113
but this must be something new.

1124
00:42:13,743 --> 00:42:14,743
(Punching)

1125
00:42:15,843 --> 00:42:16,943
That's amazing.

1126
00:42:19,743 --> 00:42:20,783
(He flops on the floor.)

1127
00:42:22,283 --> 00:42:24,343
- Go, So You!
 -  Jong Kook.

1128
00:42:24,343 --> 00:42:25,883
So You is still on the bar.

1129
00:42:25,883 --> 00:42:27,553
- So You is still on the bar.
 -  So You.

1130
00:42:27,553 --> 00:42:29,343
- So You.
 -  Don't do it, So You.

1131
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,013
(I'll win that diamond ring.)

1132
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,283
(She attacks him violently.)

1133
00:42:37,643 --> 00:42:38,713
(He flops down.)

1134
00:42:40,483 --> 00:42:41,743
(Kwang Soo is out.)

1135
00:42:42,053 --> 00:42:43,131
He did a great job.

1136
00:42:43,131 --> 00:42:44,143
That was impressive.

1137
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:46,420
You should've done this.

1138
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,843
Jong Gook's couple earns two points.

1139
00:42:49,913 --> 00:42:51,783
Kwang Soo's couple earns one point.

1140
00:42:56,113 --> 00:42:59,883
(It's not over. It's round two.)

1141
00:42:59,883 --> 00:43:01,583
(Youth Race)

1142
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:03,943
Next up is "Couple Badminton".

1143
00:43:04,613 --> 00:43:05,897
That's right.

1144
00:43:05,897 --> 00:43:07,113
- What is that?
 -  It looks good.

1145
00:43:07,553 --> 00:43:09,053
- Wow.
 -  I'll explain.

1146
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:10,913
(A big and thick racket appears.)

1147
00:43:11,983 --> 00:43:15,383
One person from each couple must use this racket.

1148
00:43:16,113 --> 00:43:21,287
The other person will have to use one of the various rackets...

1149
00:43:21,287 --> 00:43:22,943
that aren't normal.

1150
00:43:22,943 --> 00:43:26,743
It will be randomly picked.

1151
00:43:26,743 --> 00:43:28,743
This is what the game will be.

1152
00:43:29,183 --> 00:43:31,213
The first team to make the first five points wins.

1153
00:43:31,213 --> 00:43:32,330
- That sounds good.
 -  Five points?

1154
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:33,413
It sounds simple.

1155
00:43:33,413 --> 00:43:34,883
You win when you earn five points.

1156
00:43:43,443 --> 00:43:45,683
Please start the game. The team to earn five points wins.

1157
00:43:46,683 --> 00:43:52,843
(Kwang Soo's team vs Gary's team)

1158
00:43:52,843 --> 00:43:54,643
Please start the game. The team to earn five points wins.

1159
00:43:54,643 --> 00:43:58,087
(Round one of Couple Badminton starts.)

1160
00:43:58,087 --> 00:44:02,543
(Will she be able to serve with a flipper?)

1161
00:44:07,113 --> 00:44:08,183
(She serves the ball.)

1162
00:44:11,343 --> 00:44:12,343
He's good.

1163
00:44:13,683 --> 00:44:16,483
(The type of racket isn't important.)

1164
00:44:16,483 --> 00:44:19,783
(She looks comfortable playing with a table tennis racket.)

1165
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:22,143
(They continue to hit back and forth.)

1166
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,283
(It hits the floor.)

1167
00:44:23,883 --> 00:44:27,383
(Kwang Soo's team earns 1 point.)

1168
00:44:27,383 --> 00:44:28,383
They play well.

1169
00:44:28,383 --> 00:44:30,024
Gary, go closer to the net.

1170
00:44:30,024 --> 00:44:31,983
This racket works well.

1171
00:44:31,983 --> 00:44:33,217
Goodness.

1172
00:44:33,217 --> 00:44:34,303
Why? What's wrong?

1173
00:44:34,303 --> 00:44:36,683
I'm just saying this is upsetting.

1174
00:44:37,613 --> 00:44:39,943
Gary seems to be getting upset.

1175
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:41,443
You need to lift the ball high.

1176
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:43,183
- I'll serve.
 -  Okay.

1177
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:45,734
(The game resumes.)

1178
00:44:45,734 --> 00:44:46,843
That's good.

1179
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:50,953
- That's right.
 -  That's right.

1180
00:44:50,953 --> 00:44:53,113
(An unexpected hit)

1181
00:44:53,883 --> 00:44:54,913
(He's satisfied.)

1182
00:44:55,243 --> 00:44:57,113
- Wow.
 -  That's right.

1183
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,583
It's fun to watch the shuttlecock move across the net.

1184
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:01,343
Hyo Lyn plays well.

1185
00:45:01,343 --> 00:45:03,343
- Have you played it before?
 -  You're doing well.

1186
00:45:03,713 --> 00:45:04,983
No, I just have a good racket.

1187
00:45:05,383 --> 00:45:06,883
- She plays well.
 -  That's great.

1188
00:45:06,883 --> 00:45:08,183
- They're coming up with a plan.
 -  This game is fun.

1189
00:45:09,143 --> 00:45:10,783
- How do I serve?
 -  You can do it.

1190
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,943
(What's Gary and Hyo Lyn's plan?)

1191
00:45:11,943 --> 00:45:13,220
That's right.

1192
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:16,283
(Their plan is to target the back corner.)

1193
00:45:18,313 --> 00:45:23,183
(Will she score easily?)

1194
00:45:24,043 --> 00:45:25,143
That's right.

1195
00:45:26,413 --> 00:45:27,443
(She hits.)

1196
00:45:27,883 --> 00:45:30,343
(She makes a strong counterattack.)

1197
00:45:30,343 --> 00:45:31,443
(The ball hits the net.)

1198
00:45:33,113 --> 00:45:35,513
(Gary gets flustered by Bo Ra's play.)

1199
00:45:36,313 --> 00:45:38,683
- This team is fun to watch.
 -  Bo Ra also plays well.

1200
00:45:38,683 --> 00:45:40,263
Did you study physical education?

1201
00:45:40,263 --> 00:45:41,943
Da Som also plays badminton well.

1202
00:45:41,943 --> 00:45:42,943
(Kwang Soo's team has 2 points total.)

1203
00:45:44,183 --> 00:45:46,683
- This game is fun.
 -  It's fun to watch.

1204
00:45:46,683 --> 00:45:47,713
(He throws the birdie.)

1205
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:50,190
(There you go.)

1206
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,483
It's Bo Ra's serve anyway.

1207
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:53,613
It's a psychological warfare.

1208
00:45:53,613 --> 00:45:55,383
(Fine, let's do it, Bo Ra.)

1209
00:45:56,513 --> 00:45:57,783
(He's nervous.)

1210
00:45:58,813 --> 00:46:00,943
I can't see Bo Ra because of Kwang Soo.

1211
00:46:00,943 --> 00:46:02,713
Kwang Soo is too tall. I can't see either.

1212
00:46:02,713 --> 00:46:06,583
(That's right. This is...)

1213
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:09,043
(the flipper-hiding tactic.)

1214
00:46:09,443 --> 00:46:10,583
I can't...

1215
00:46:13,013 --> 00:46:14,253
Okay!

1216
00:46:14,253 --> 00:46:15,543
(It was a blinding attack.)

1217
00:46:15,543 --> 00:46:17,443
- That was awesome!
 -  The birdie was too fast.

1218
00:46:18,213 --> 00:46:20,024
(Rest in my shade.)

1219
00:46:20,024 --> 00:46:21,903
- They're good.
 -  Bo Ra also plays well.

1220
00:46:21,903 --> 00:46:23,483
- Awesome.
 -  The flipper is powerful.

1221
00:46:23,483 --> 00:46:24,483
The serve was quick.

1222
00:46:24,483 --> 00:46:25,783
Give us a good serve.

1223
00:46:26,113 --> 00:46:28,413
- Serving requires technique.
 -  I see.

1224
00:46:28,413 --> 00:46:30,383
- The racket can't go over the net.
 -  Okay.

1225
00:46:30,783 --> 00:46:33,313
(Only the racket shouldn't go over the net, right?)

1226
00:46:33,883 --> 00:46:35,683
That's so...

1227
00:46:35,683 --> 00:46:37,643
(What is he doing?)

1228
00:46:37,643 --> 00:46:39,313
That's a foul, Kwang Soo.

1229
00:46:39,313 --> 00:46:40,783
- Was it over the net? Sorry.
 -  Yes, it was.

1230
00:46:40,783 --> 00:46:42,443
- All right.
 -  That's so funny.

1231
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:43,913
Then I'll serve.

1232
00:46:45,083 --> 00:46:46,113
It'd be funny if the birdie was blocked by Kwang Soo.

1233
00:46:46,113 --> 00:46:47,183
- Flipper will be better.
 -  Right.

1234
00:46:47,183 --> 00:46:48,513
- Good.
 -  We need a bigger one.

1235
00:46:48,943 --> 00:46:50,093
That's it.

1236
00:46:50,093 --> 00:46:51,783
(Kwang Soo makes a powerful smash.)

1237
00:46:51,783 --> 00:46:53,383
(Here goes my powerful shot.)

1238
00:46:54,413 --> 00:46:57,983
(It's 4 to 1 so far. It can be his last chance to attack.)

1239
00:46:59,313 --> 00:47:00,443
- Nice!
 -  Hit it!

1240
00:47:00,913 --> 00:47:02,383
(This shot ends the match.)

1241
00:47:02,383 --> 00:47:03,383
He's good.

1242
00:47:03,383 --> 00:47:04,643
He's so tall.

1243
00:47:04,643 --> 00:47:06,043
- We won!
 -  He's so tall...

1244
00:47:06,043 --> 00:47:07,983
- That was powerful.
 -  that he strikes from a high point.

1245
00:47:07,983 --> 00:47:09,113
Did we lose again?

1246
00:47:09,113 --> 00:47:10,183
Gary.

1247
00:47:10,613 --> 00:47:13,383
We'll finish the match very fast.

1248
00:47:13,383 --> 00:47:15,043
The sound will be very light.

1249
00:47:15,043 --> 00:47:16,383
(Jong Kook's team vs Jae Seok's team)

1250
00:47:16,383 --> 00:47:17,443
Let's end the match fast.

1251
00:47:17,843 --> 00:47:18,930
- We can do it!
 -  Let's go for it.

1252
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:21,913
(How will this match turn out?)

1253
00:47:23,983 --> 00:47:25,583
(That's good.)

1254
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:27,783
(That is a full swing.)

1255
00:47:27,783 --> 00:47:31,213
(Jong Kook's dreadful swing)

1256
00:47:35,043 --> 00:47:36,083
(They counterattack.)

1257
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:38,183
We made it!

1258
00:47:38,183 --> 00:47:39,213
(But it is too weak.)

1259
00:47:40,243 --> 00:47:41,843
- Gosh.
 -  Goodness.

1260
00:47:42,283 --> 00:47:44,683
- They're good.
 -  Why are they so good?

1261
00:47:44,683 --> 00:47:47,543
He doesn't even need that big racket.

1262
00:47:47,543 --> 00:47:49,013
He's too strong.

1263
00:47:49,013 --> 00:47:50,043
It's like a fly swatter.

1264
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:53,683
(Listen to that sound!)

1265
00:47:54,483 --> 00:47:55,683
(Jae Seok slides and hits the birdie.)

1266
00:47:55,683 --> 00:47:56,713
That was so cool.

1267
00:47:56,713 --> 00:47:57,843
(Da Som attacks.)

1268
00:47:57,843 --> 00:47:58,913
(It's a piece of cake for me.)

1269
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,783
(Jong Kook's team earns another point.)

1270
00:48:03,783 --> 00:48:04,783
Good job.

1271
00:48:04,783 --> 00:48:06,313
(Jae Seok's team has no point so far.)

1272
00:48:06,313 --> 00:48:09,143
(Is he a singer or an athlete?)

1273
00:48:09,813 --> 00:48:11,183
(Here it goes.)

1274
00:48:11,183 --> 00:48:12,443
- Gosh.
 -  Wow.

1275
00:48:12,443 --> 00:48:13,443
Let's do it again.

1276
00:48:13,983 --> 00:48:15,483
(It is a sudden attack.)

1277
00:48:15,483 --> 00:48:17,583
(But Jong Kook successfully defends.)

1278
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:19,043
(You're so good.)

1279
00:48:19,843 --> 00:48:22,043
- That's unbelievable.
 -  It's okay.

1280
00:48:22,043 --> 00:48:23,183
Gosh, that was amazing.

1281
00:48:23,183 --> 00:48:25,283
- He got another point.
 -  He's strong.

1282
00:48:25,283 --> 00:48:26,383
(Jong Kook's team has 3 points.)

1283
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:28,143
It's over.

1284
00:48:28,983 --> 00:48:30,343
- Da Som, concentrate.
 -  Let's resume.

1285
00:48:31,813 --> 00:48:35,943
(We have no choice but this in order to defeat Jong Kook.)

1286
00:48:36,843 --> 00:48:38,183
(What is that over there?)

1287
00:48:38,643 --> 00:48:39,643
Let's go.

1288
00:48:39,643 --> 00:48:42,743
(Jae Seok distracts Jong Kook and serves all of a sudden.)

1289
00:48:42,743 --> 00:48:45,913
(And Jae Seok smashes wisely.)

1290
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:48,783
Gosh, that was so sly.

1291
00:48:48,783 --> 00:48:50,643
(Jae Seok's team earns a point.)

1292
00:48:54,743 --> 00:48:56,143
- Here it goes!
 -  Okay.

1293
00:48:56,143 --> 00:48:57,213
(They hit it back.)

1294
00:48:58,043 --> 00:49:00,983
(The two pans come together and hit the birdie back.)

1295
00:49:02,043 --> 00:49:03,113
That was a spike.

1296
00:49:04,183 --> 00:49:05,213
Do we get to serve this time?

1297
00:49:05,213 --> 00:49:06,543
What a close match.

1298
00:49:07,883 --> 00:49:09,913
(Jae Seok tries to close the gap.)

1299
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:11,883
(Jong Kook tries to widen the gap.)

1300
00:49:11,883 --> 00:49:13,583
Good!

1301
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:14,613
It's deuce.

1302
00:49:14,613 --> 00:49:15,613
(They go to deuce.)

1303
00:49:15,613 --> 00:49:16,943
This match is very interesting.

1304
00:49:16,943 --> 00:49:18,443
- You can serve.
 -  Gosh, this is crazy.

1305
00:49:18,443 --> 00:49:19,483
(He's anxious.)

1306
00:49:19,983 --> 00:49:21,683
(Jae Seok is very close to the net.)

1307
00:49:21,683 --> 00:49:23,883
- That won't work though.
 -  He's too upfront.

1308
00:49:23,883 --> 00:49:25,643
You can never make it.

1309
00:49:25,643 --> 00:49:27,043
- That's right.
 -  Okay. Fine.

1310
00:49:27,043 --> 00:49:28,510
(No wonder I felt anxious.)

1311
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:29,613
You should step back.

1312
00:49:29,613 --> 00:49:31,083
- I'll keep my manners.
 -  You are so crafty.

1313
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:32,843
- That was so ridiculous.
 -  Okay, okay.

1314
00:49:32,843 --> 00:49:34,083
Okay.

1315
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:36,113
(The team who gets 2 points first wins.)

1316
00:49:36,113 --> 00:49:37,183
- Let's resume the match.
 -  Okay.

1317
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:38,183
Let's go!

1318
00:49:38,783 --> 00:49:39,983
Go for it.

1319
00:49:41,583 --> 00:49:42,683
Good.

1320
00:49:42,683 --> 00:49:44,613
(He blocks it with all his might.)

1321
00:49:46,613 --> 00:49:47,683
Okay!

1322
00:49:47,683 --> 00:49:49,813
(This is a good chance to smash.)

1323
00:49:51,443 --> 00:49:53,983
(Take that!)

1324
00:49:54,343 --> 00:49:56,783
Nice!

1325
00:49:56,783 --> 00:49:57,843
(We made it!)

1326
00:49:57,843 --> 00:49:59,413
- Good.
 -  Well done.

1327
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,783
(Jae Seok's team is leading by one point.)

1328
00:50:00,783 --> 00:50:01,983
You just need one more point.

1329
00:50:03,183 --> 00:50:04,313
Shall I throw my racket and hit him?

1330
00:50:05,313 --> 00:50:06,313
Then I'll dodge like this.

1331
00:50:07,513 --> 00:50:09,113
(Jae Seok irritates Jong Kook.)

1332
00:50:09,113 --> 00:50:10,243
Fine. Come on.

1333
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:14,283
(Jong Kook serves with a grunt.)

1334
00:50:16,483 --> 00:50:17,913
(It's a fierce rally.)

1335
00:50:17,913 --> 00:50:18,913
- Gosh.
 -  Are you okay?

1336
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:22,783
(This can be the last match. I must win!)

1337
00:50:25,413 --> 00:50:26,513
- Are you okay?
 -  I'm okay.

1338
00:50:26,513 --> 00:50:27,583
It's okay.

1339
00:50:27,943 --> 00:50:31,043
(It's just a game but they're so fierce.)

1340
00:50:32,683 --> 00:50:33,743
- Are you okay?
 -  I'm okay.

1341
00:50:35,313 --> 00:50:36,483
(Jae Seok counterattacks.)

1342
00:50:37,413 --> 00:50:40,683
(Will she be able to counterattack?)

1343
00:50:42,783 --> 00:50:45,383
(She hits it back!)

1344
00:50:50,483 --> 00:50:51,483
That's it!

1345
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:53,913
(We won!)

1346
00:50:55,143 --> 00:50:58,513
(Jae Seok's team wins.)

1347
00:50:58,843 --> 00:51:01,083
(They move on to the next round.)

1348
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:02,383
- Get five points first.
 -  Let's do it!

1349
00:51:02,383 --> 00:51:05,013
(Ji Hyo's team vs Seok Jin's team)

1350
00:51:05,013 --> 00:51:06,013
(They show slapstick humours.)

1351
00:51:06,013 --> 00:51:08,083
(Seok Jin and Haha win.)

1352
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:09,543
- Good.
 -  Seok Jin and Haha won.

1353
00:51:09,543 --> 00:51:10,543
It's hard.

1354
00:51:10,543 --> 00:51:11,813
(Kwang Soo's team vs Seok Jin's team)

1355
00:51:11,813 --> 00:51:13,183
You can do it!

1356
00:51:13,183 --> 00:51:14,183
Good.

1357
00:51:14,183 --> 00:51:16,083
- Strike it!
 -  Go for it!

1358
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:17,213
Bo Ra is good at this.

1359
00:51:17,213 --> 00:51:19,090
(Bo Ra is the MVP.)

1360
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:20,843
(Kwang Soo and Bo Ra move to the final round.)

1361
00:51:20,843 --> 00:51:22,013
Kwang Soo's team wins.

1362
00:51:22,743 --> 00:51:25,113
(Kwang Soo's team vs Jae Seok's team)

1363
00:51:25,113 --> 00:51:26,243
(Final round)

1364
00:51:26,943 --> 00:51:29,413
(Will Jae Seok's team win with their speed?)

1365
00:51:29,413 --> 00:51:31,643
(Or will Kwang Soo's team overcome them with their power?)

1366
00:51:31,643 --> 00:51:34,083
You must get back at them.

1367
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:35,283
- That's right.
 -  Yes.

1368
00:51:35,283 --> 00:51:36,383
- Bo Ra, let's go for it.
 -  Okay.

1369
00:51:36,383 --> 00:51:37,843
- We'll win.
 -  You can't beat us.

1370
00:51:37,843 --> 00:51:38,913
- This is...
 -  You'll never beat us.

1371
00:51:38,913 --> 00:51:40,013
(This is time for revenge.)

1372
00:51:41,213 --> 00:51:42,513
Let's do our best.

1373
00:51:43,283 --> 00:51:44,343
Let's go, Bo Ra.

1374
00:51:46,613 --> 00:51:48,013
Goodness.

1375
00:51:48,013 --> 00:51:50,983
(It's another fierce rally.)

1376
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:53,130
(All four of them are very concentrated.)

1377
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:54,543
You have to hit it back.

1378
00:51:54,983 --> 00:51:55,983
Wow!

1379
00:51:57,943 --> 00:51:59,713
(It's like a Wimbledon match.)

1380
00:51:59,713 --> 00:52:00,783
Strike it.

1381
00:52:00,783 --> 00:52:02,283
- Wow.
 -  Good!

1382
00:52:02,283 --> 00:52:04,483
(He blocks it.)

1383
00:52:05,943 --> 00:52:07,843
- We're so good.
 -  They're really...

1384
00:52:07,843 --> 00:52:09,943
- good.
 -  It's like a tennis match.

1385
00:52:09,943 --> 00:52:11,713
There are so many points.

1386
00:52:12,613 --> 00:52:14,913
(Nice attack!)

1387
00:52:16,083 --> 00:52:17,350
Okay!

1388
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:19,043
(He blocks again.)

1389
00:52:19,643 --> 00:52:21,513
- This is...
 -  My goodness!

1390
00:52:22,543 --> 00:52:23,643
He uses the racket skilfully.

1391
00:52:24,113 --> 00:52:25,383
I've mastered this.

1392
00:52:25,813 --> 00:52:27,213
This is like a tennis match.

1393
00:52:27,213 --> 00:52:28,743
(Kwang Soo's team is leading by 2 points.)

1394
00:52:30,683 --> 00:52:33,883
(Now, Kwang Soo's team is leading by 3 points.)

1395
00:52:35,243 --> 00:52:37,213
(Spectacular)

1396
00:52:37,683 --> 00:52:40,583
(This match seems like a preliminary round for the Olympics.)

1397
00:52:41,713 --> 00:52:42,713
(You can't beat us.)

1398
00:52:43,213 --> 00:52:44,643
(Kwang Soo's third block.)

1399
00:52:44,643 --> 00:52:45,856
Yes!

1400
00:52:45,856 --> 00:52:46,883
That was amazing.

1401
00:52:46,883 --> 00:52:47,913
(It's like the Wailing Wall.)

1402
00:52:47,913 --> 00:52:50,213
- My goodness.
 -  Gosh.

1403
00:52:50,213 --> 00:52:52,413
You're so good. What was that?

1404
00:52:52,813 --> 00:52:54,017
- My goodness.
 -  Gosh.

1405
00:52:54,017 --> 00:52:55,643
- That was awesome.
 -  He's so good.

1406
00:52:55,643 --> 00:52:57,013
Just get one more point!

1407
00:52:57,013 --> 00:52:58,613
- That was awesome.
 -  He's so good.

1408
00:52:58,613 --> 00:53:00,413
(They just need to win once more.)

1409
00:53:00,413 --> 00:53:02,213
(Will they be able to?)

1410
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:04,043
- Get one more point!
 -  We can do it!

1411
00:53:04,043 --> 00:53:07,443
(Or will Jae Seok's team be able to turn the tables?)

1412
00:53:07,943 --> 00:53:09,913
We can turn the match around.

1413
00:53:09,913 --> 00:53:11,183
(Let's do our best.)

1414
00:53:11,643 --> 00:53:12,713
You can't beat us.

1415
00:53:13,283 --> 00:53:14,520
(Da Som strikes the birdie.)

1416
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,543
You can't beat us.

1417
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:20,043
(The birdie flies high.)

1418
00:53:20,043 --> 00:53:21,043
It's over.

1419
00:53:23,183 --> 00:53:26,243
(Da Som strikes the birdie high.)

1420
00:53:26,243 --> 00:53:28,743
(How will this turn out?)

1421
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:32,543
(Kwang Soo smashes.)

1422
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,183
(Catch it if you can.)

1423
00:53:38,243 --> 00:53:39,613
(But Jae Seok makes it.)

1424
00:53:40,243 --> 00:53:41,243
Nice!

1425
00:53:42,083 --> 00:53:43,983
(They lose pathetically.)

1426
00:53:46,343 --> 00:53:47,483
Nice!

1427
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,683
We won!

1428
00:53:49,683 --> 00:53:50,683
- It's over.
 -  This is so annoying.

1429
00:53:50,683 --> 00:53:51,713
Please come out of the court.

1430
00:53:53,183 --> 00:53:54,683
But you received one point, too.

1431
00:53:54,683 --> 00:53:56,443
Kwang Soo's couple gets two points,

1432
00:53:56,443 --> 00:53:57,843
- This was close.
 -  and Jae Seok's gets one point.

1433
00:53:57,843 --> 00:53:59,443
- Great.
 -  Kwang Soo did a good job.

1434
00:53:59,443 --> 00:54:00,483
(The couples get 2 and 1 points respectively.)

1435
00:54:00,483 --> 00:54:03,613
(Kwang Soo's team has a total of 9 points.)

1436
00:54:04,683 --> 00:54:07,043
(It's still pouring out.)

1437
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:09,983
(But their trip continues.)

1438
00:54:09,983 --> 00:54:11,313
My goodness.

1439
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,213
- That looks so tasty.
 -  It smells so good.

1440
00:54:15,613 --> 00:54:17,683
- It smells good.
 -  Let's eat!

1441
00:54:17,683 --> 00:54:20,213
I love this smell.

1442
00:54:20,783 --> 00:54:22,083
Here comes my partner.

1443
00:54:22,883 --> 00:54:24,243
- Hello.
 -  His wig changed!

1444
00:54:24,713 --> 00:54:25,813
- Seok Jin?
 -  It's my partner.

1445
00:54:26,243 --> 00:54:27,443
I went to a hair salon.

1446
00:54:27,443 --> 00:54:28,656
Go to the end.

1447
00:54:28,656 --> 00:54:30,043
Where is Da Som?

1448
00:54:30,043 --> 00:54:31,183
Where's she?

1449
00:54:31,183 --> 00:54:33,014
Thank you.

1450
00:54:33,014 --> 00:54:35,183
- Thank you.
 -  Please help yourselves.

1451
00:54:35,183 --> 00:54:36,243
Thank you.

1452
00:54:36,613 --> 00:54:39,343
- It looks so tasty.
 -  I've never had dakgalbi here.

1453
00:54:39,343 --> 00:54:40,343
- Me, too.
 -  Really?

1454
00:54:43,543 --> 00:54:44,783
- This is so good.
 -  Gosh.

1455
00:54:45,483 --> 00:54:47,283
- We eat a lot today.
 -  Please eat a lot.

1456
00:54:47,813 --> 00:54:48,813
It's good.

1457
00:54:48,813 --> 00:54:50,590
(She's shy.)

1458
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:52,610
(Their chemistry is good.)

1459
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:54,713
I love dakgalbi. Which one should I eat first?

1460
00:54:54,713 --> 00:54:55,783
(They make another good memory in Chuncheon.)

1461
00:54:55,783 --> 00:54:57,183
I really wanted dakgalbi.

1462
00:54:57,683 --> 00:55:01,213
Anyway, do Ji Hyo and Shownu get along well?

1463
00:55:01,213 --> 00:55:02,813
We talked a lot.

1464
00:55:03,143 --> 00:55:06,213
What do you think about Ji Hyo?

1465
00:55:06,213 --> 00:55:07,813
She takes good care of me.

1466
00:55:09,183 --> 00:55:11,783
Ji Hyo is nice to younger boys.

1467
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:14,343
I'm kind to girls, too.

1468
00:55:14,343 --> 00:55:16,713
Hyo Lyn fell asleep back then, and Ji Hyo covered her with a towel.

1469
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:18,513
- She covered me with a towel.
 -  She covered her.

1470
00:55:19,283 --> 00:55:20,587
Then why is she so mean to me?

1471
00:55:20,587 --> 00:55:21,913
Because you ask for it.

1472
00:55:22,243 --> 00:55:23,283
You're so annoying.

1473
00:55:24,213 --> 00:55:26,243
The way Ji Hyo treats you is more than you deserve.

1474
00:55:26,243 --> 00:55:28,913
Gary and Hyo Lyn, please eat a lot.

1475
00:55:28,913 --> 00:55:30,643
Okay. We're very tired.

1476
00:55:30,643 --> 00:55:33,643
I never thought you two would look this good together.

1477
00:55:33,643 --> 00:55:35,183
- It's unexpected.
 -  You look good together.

1478
00:55:35,183 --> 00:55:36,613
Your chemistry is good.

1479
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:38,383
- They look great together.
 -  Right.

1480
00:55:38,383 --> 00:55:39,783
Eat slowly if you want to twerk later.

1481
00:55:40,843 --> 00:55:42,117
(Hyo Lyn is happy.)

1482
00:55:42,117 --> 00:55:43,683
That's the only thing we're good at.

1483
00:55:45,313 --> 00:55:46,343
We didn't get any points.

1484
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,283
(But they're good dancers.)

1485
00:55:48,283 --> 00:55:50,313
- Did you enjoy the dakgalbi?
 -  Yes.

1486
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:52,813
Then, now it's time...

1487
00:55:52,813 --> 00:55:54,883
- to make fried rice.
 -  Right.

1488
00:55:54,883 --> 00:55:57,183
We gave dakgalbi for free.

1489
00:55:57,183 --> 00:56:02,843
But unfortunately, the team who gets first place will get two bowls.

1490
00:56:02,843 --> 00:56:04,243
And the second team will get one bowl of fried rice.

1491
00:56:04,243 --> 00:56:05,890
- I see.
 -  I want fried rice.

1492
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:07,913
If you eat dakgalbi but not the fried rice,

1493
00:56:07,913 --> 00:56:09,813
you're left with much regret.

1494
00:56:09,813 --> 00:56:11,613
We ate only meat.

1495
00:56:11,613 --> 00:56:13,313
- We need some rice.
 -  Right.

1496
00:56:13,313 --> 00:56:15,283
- I want rice so badly.
 -  Me, too.

1497
00:56:15,283 --> 00:56:16,283
I really want fried rice.

1498
00:56:16,283 --> 00:56:17,443
(How does this delicious fried rice look?)

1499
00:56:18,013 --> 00:56:19,413
- Thank you.
 -  Here it comes.

1500
00:56:19,413 --> 00:56:22,283
- I want to eat it.
 -  Gosh, I want it so bad.

1501
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,643
(Dakgalbi and fried rice must always go together.)

1502
00:56:29,343 --> 00:56:31,466
(The two winning teams were Gary's and Ji Hyo's, respectively.)

1503
00:56:31,466 --> 00:56:32,713
It's fried rice.

1504
00:56:32,713 --> 00:56:33,783
(The two winning teams were Gary's and Ji Hyo's, respectively.)

1505
00:56:33,783 --> 00:56:36,083
- That looks delicious.
 -  It looks delicious.

1506
00:56:36,483 --> 00:56:38,413
There are too many delicious foods in this world.

1507
00:56:38,413 --> 00:56:39,413
I agree.

1508
00:56:40,643 --> 00:56:42,483
(Please let me have some.)

1509
00:56:42,483 --> 00:56:43,513
Thank you.

1510
00:56:45,013 --> 00:56:49,083
(The perfect fried rice is ready.)

1511
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:50,683
- Thank you for the food.
 -  I will try it.

1512
00:56:51,143 --> 00:56:52,450
I will taste it.

1513
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,483
Enjoy your meals.

1514
00:56:54,483 --> 00:56:58,083
Gary's team got two points.

1515
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:59,883
Ji Hyo's team got one point.

1516
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:04,587
After eating the fried rice, you have to eat makguksu.

1517
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,383
Chuncheon is known for their makguksu.

1518
00:57:06,383 --> 00:57:09,483
- We have to eat it.
 -  We have to have makguksu.

1519
00:57:09,483 --> 00:57:11,583
- Right.
 -  We must.

1520
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:14,743
- We're going to play a game.
 -  Okay.

1521
00:57:14,743 --> 00:57:18,383
The team that wins will get two points and two bowls of makguksu.

1522
00:57:18,383 --> 00:57:22,643
The team that comes in second will get one point and one bowl.

1523
00:57:22,643 --> 00:57:23,913
Let's do this.

1524
00:57:23,913 --> 00:57:25,613
We are going to play...

1525
00:57:25,613 --> 00:57:28,043
"Biscuit Dancing Time".

1526
00:57:28,043 --> 00:57:29,213
- What's that?
 -  Dancing?

1527
00:57:29,213 --> 00:57:32,413
While holding a biscuit in your mouths,

1528
00:57:32,413 --> 00:57:35,613
you have to dance for a minute.

1529
00:57:35,613 --> 00:57:37,243
You will be wearing pace counters.

1530
00:57:37,243 --> 00:57:40,713
The couple with the highest number will win.

1531
00:57:41,213 --> 00:57:42,597
The couple that has the second highest number comes second.

1532
00:57:42,597 --> 00:57:44,270
Gary's team are going to have a blast.

1533
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:45,943
Please put the counter on her hips.

1534
00:57:46,543 --> 00:57:48,013
We are at a disadvantage.

1535
00:57:48,513 --> 00:57:49,843
- Our heights...
 -  Your heights don't match.

1536
00:57:49,843 --> 00:57:51,763
(They face a difficulty from the start.)

1537
00:57:51,763 --> 00:57:53,113
The three couples will go first.

1538
00:57:53,113 --> 00:57:54,483
- We are?
 -  Yes.

1539
00:57:54,483 --> 00:57:56,043
Hyo Lyn and Gary are here.

1540
00:57:56,043 --> 00:57:57,943
- Wow!
 -  They're the sexy couple.

1541
00:57:57,943 --> 00:58:00,543
I am excited to see Hyo Lyn dance.

1542
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:01,713
Gosh...

1543
00:58:01,713 --> 00:58:03,383
Ready.

1544
00:58:04,243 --> 00:58:06,043
- They are the best.
 -  They're the sexy couple.

1545
00:58:06,043 --> 00:58:08,613
Bite on the biscuit. Music, cue.

1546
00:58:08,613 --> 00:58:10,283
Look at them.

1547
00:58:10,283 --> 00:58:11,613
I don't want to do that.

1548
00:58:12,843 --> 00:58:15,183
(Everyone just shakes their legs.)

1549
00:58:16,683 --> 00:58:18,213
(They look shy, )

1550
00:58:18,213 --> 00:58:19,713
(but their ankles move as if they have motors!)

1551
00:58:19,713 --> 00:58:21,743
Look at Hyo Lyn.

1552
00:58:21,743 --> 00:58:22,913
Look at her.

1553
00:58:22,913 --> 00:58:25,383
(But there's one couple that looks unique.)

1554
00:58:25,383 --> 00:58:27,813
(Feel the passion of South America!)

1555
00:58:27,813 --> 00:58:29,783
Look at them.

1556
00:58:29,783 --> 00:58:31,043
They are something.

1557
00:58:31,043 --> 00:58:32,283
(We approve of you.)

1558
00:58:32,613 --> 00:58:33,613
They are the best.

1559
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:35,113
Bravo!

1560
00:58:35,113 --> 00:58:36,713
Go, Hyo Lyn!

1561
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:39,243
Bravo!

1562
00:58:39,243 --> 00:58:41,613
(They're in love with the couple!)

1563
00:58:42,783 --> 00:58:44,213
(Their dance is of different class!)

1564
00:58:44,213 --> 00:58:45,613
Hyo Lyn and Gary...

1565
00:58:46,443 --> 00:58:47,713
give me the chills.

1566
00:58:50,243 --> 00:58:52,783
(We are in Brazil!)

1567
00:58:54,713 --> 00:58:56,513
(Shaking)

1568
00:58:57,843 --> 00:58:59,643
(Dancers nationwide, )

1569
00:59:00,743 --> 00:59:03,483
(join us in Chuncheon!)

1570
00:59:04,983 --> 00:59:06,213
Hyo Lyn and Gary...

1571
00:59:06,213 --> 00:59:07,243
(Everyone's attention is fixed at the couple.)

1572
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:08,413
give me the chills.

1573
00:59:08,983 --> 00:59:10,113
- They are...
 -  This is crazy.

1574
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:12,213
Look at them. I feel so embarrassed.

1575
00:59:12,213 --> 00:59:14,243
(They say they're embarrassed, but they keep watching them.)

1576
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:16,383
(Jae Seok's excited, too.)

1577
00:59:16,913 --> 00:59:18,083
They are really good.

1578
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:19,183
(They have 5 seconds left.)

1579
00:59:19,813 --> 00:59:21,083
I can't watch them.

1580
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:22,113
(Shake it until the end!)

1581
00:59:22,113 --> 00:59:23,183
They are unbelievable.

1582
00:59:23,183 --> 00:59:24,783
Please check the counter.

1583
00:59:24,783 --> 00:59:26,013
Don't you think you were too close?

1584
00:59:26,013 --> 00:59:27,513
We were just doing our best.

1585
00:59:27,513 --> 00:59:29,483
The other couples were out of our sights.

1586
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:32,043
Bo Ra, please show us your count.

1587
00:59:32,043 --> 00:59:34,413
Bo Ra's count is 144.

1588
00:59:34,413 --> 00:59:36,483
(Bo Ra's count is 144.)

1589
00:59:36,483 --> 00:59:37,843
Kwang Soo has 138.

1590
00:59:37,843 --> 00:59:38,983
(The total count is 282.)

1591
00:59:39,413 --> 00:59:41,313
Shownu got 140.

1592
00:59:41,313 --> 00:59:42,743
What did he do to get that number?

1593
00:59:42,743 --> 00:59:44,443
Ji Hyo got 126.

1594
00:59:44,443 --> 00:59:45,713
(The total score is 266.)

1595
00:59:46,143 --> 00:59:47,913
- I got 124.
 -  Hyo Lyn got 124.

1596
00:59:47,913 --> 00:59:48,943
(Hyo Lyn got 124.)

1597
00:59:48,943 --> 00:59:50,183
- Gary got...
 -  I thought she got more.

1598
00:59:50,183 --> 00:59:51,583
(What did Gary get?)

1599
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:52,743
How could you get only 39?

1600
00:59:53,343 --> 00:59:54,513
(He's embarrassed.)

1601
00:59:54,513 --> 00:59:55,913
I was busy supporting her.

1602
00:59:55,913 --> 00:59:57,443
But you were playing a game.

1603
00:59:57,443 --> 00:59:58,613
What's that?

1604
00:59:58,613 --> 01:00:00,543
- I was busy holding her.
 -  Gosh...

1605
01:00:00,543 --> 01:00:03,583
- That much for the hips is a lot.
 -  It really is.

1606
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:05,610
- You did get a lot.
 -  Perhaps mine is broken.

1607
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:07,483
This was all that you did.

1608
01:00:07,483 --> 01:00:09,143
I had to sync with her. That's why.

1609
01:00:09,913 --> 01:00:11,013
- I...
 -  You should've focused.

1610
01:00:11,013 --> 01:00:13,683
The count was all that mattered, not the dance.

1611
01:00:13,683 --> 01:00:15,383
- You did well.
 -  The next teams can come out.

1612
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,443
- Ready.
 -  Where do I put it?

1613
01:00:19,443 --> 01:00:22,783
- Come on.
 -  Jae Seok can put it on his waist.

1614
01:00:22,783 --> 01:00:24,583
- Waist?
 -  Your waist is unbelievable.

1615
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:26,683
Ready and bite the biscuit.

1616
01:00:26,683 --> 01:00:30,013
- It might snap.
 -  Music, cue.

1617
01:00:30,013 --> 01:00:31,513
(It has begun.)

1618
01:00:31,513 --> 01:00:32,943
(They all shake their legs.)

1619
01:00:33,943 --> 01:00:35,283
Jong Kook is so funny.

1620
01:00:37,983 --> 01:00:39,413
Look at them.

1621
01:00:39,413 --> 01:00:40,713
(At that time, )

1622
01:00:40,713 --> 01:00:41,783
(something drops.)

1623
01:00:42,643 --> 01:00:43,643
(A pace counter drops.)

1624
01:00:43,643 --> 01:00:46,263
The counter flew away.

1625
01:00:46,263 --> 01:00:47,543
You can't do anything about it.

1626
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:48,743
(Oh dear)

1627
01:00:48,743 --> 01:00:50,313
You can't do anything.

1628
01:00:52,183 --> 01:00:53,583
And this is a couple dance.

1629
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:55,383
But you guys aren't dancing.

1630
01:00:55,383 --> 01:00:57,043
I think Jae Seok's count will be high.

1631
01:00:58,143 --> 01:01:00,013
I think Jae Seok's count will be high.

1632
01:01:00,013 --> 01:01:01,513
I think Jong Kook will get a high count as well.

1633
01:01:04,143 --> 01:01:05,143
Your feet hurt at some point.

1634
01:01:05,143 --> 01:01:07,043
Aren't they too close?

1635
01:01:07,043 --> 01:01:08,613
They are about to kiss.

1636
01:01:08,613 --> 01:01:09,743
Why are your eyes closed?

1637
01:01:09,743 --> 01:01:11,543
- From the back...
 -  Open your eyes, So You!

1638
01:01:12,083 --> 01:01:13,643
Haha is cheating!

1639
01:01:13,643 --> 01:01:15,183
This is really funny.

1640
01:01:15,183 --> 01:01:16,643
- Look at Jong Kook.
 -  It's...

1641
01:01:16,643 --> 01:01:17,713
(The game is over.)

1642
01:01:17,713 --> 01:01:19,583
- I am so tired.
 -  Everyone stop.

1643
01:01:19,583 --> 01:01:20,983
- Gosh...
 -  I'm tired.

1644
01:01:20,983 --> 01:01:21,983
Da Som, really...

1645
01:01:22,713 --> 01:01:23,843
I got 102.

1646
01:01:23,843 --> 01:01:25,413
- Da Som is unbelievable.
 -  She's good.

1647
01:01:25,413 --> 01:01:26,413
(Jae Seok got 102 counts.)

1648
01:01:26,413 --> 01:01:27,583
She got 162 counts.

1649
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:30,013
- Really?
 -  How did you do this?

1650
01:01:30,013 --> 01:01:31,083
That's amazing.

1651
01:01:31,943 --> 01:01:32,983
I got 138.

1652
01:01:32,983 --> 01:01:34,760
(Jong Kook got 138.)

1653
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,513
And she got 123.

1654
01:01:36,513 --> 01:01:37,613
I got 108.

1655
01:01:38,313 --> 01:01:39,613
I got 94.

1656
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:42,013
(Their total is 202.)

1657
01:01:42,013 --> 01:01:43,043
- It's tough.
 -  It's tougher than you think.

1658
01:01:43,043 --> 01:01:45,413
Kwang Soo's team wins.

1659
01:01:45,413 --> 01:01:46,643
(Kwang Soo and Bora win.)

1660
01:01:46,643 --> 01:01:47,883
Did we win again?

1661
01:01:47,883 --> 01:01:50,213
(Ji Hyo and Shownu come 2nd.)

1662
01:01:50,713 --> 01:01:52,543
Kwang Soo's couple has won too many times.

1663
01:01:52,543 --> 01:01:55,383
- They have.
 -  They shouldn't be included.

1664
01:01:55,383 --> 01:01:58,013
- Kwang Soo's team...
 -  We're good. We can't help it.

1665
01:01:58,013 --> 01:01:59,313
- Thank you.
 -  Thank you.

1666
01:01:59,313 --> 01:02:00,483
Thank you.

1667
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:02,143
- Do you want more?
 -  Let's put some sugar.

1668
01:02:02,513 --> 01:02:03,543
Eat.

1669
01:02:04,783 --> 01:02:05,783
It's good.

1670
01:02:05,783 --> 01:02:06,913
(They love it.)

1671
01:02:07,243 --> 01:02:09,943
- It's good.
 -  Let's beat Kwang Soo.

1672
01:02:09,943 --> 01:02:11,043
- Right.
 -  Let's do that.

1673
01:02:11,043 --> 01:02:13,883
- That's a good idea.
 -  We have nine total, too.

1674
01:02:13,883 --> 01:02:14,943
Gosh.

1675
01:02:14,943 --> 01:02:15,983
(Until when will Kwang Soo continue to win?)

1676
01:02:18,243 --> 01:02:20,613
(The last location is A Museum.)

1677
01:02:20,613 --> 01:02:24,214
(They managed to come in this rain.)

1678
01:02:24,214 --> 01:02:25,313
What's this?

1679
01:02:25,813 --> 01:02:26,843
How...

1680
01:02:27,983 --> 01:02:29,883
How are we supposed to wear this?

1681
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,213
What's that?

1682
01:02:32,213 --> 01:02:33,243
How can we wear that?

1683
01:02:33,243 --> 01:02:35,213
- What's this?
 -  This is...

1684
01:02:35,213 --> 01:02:37,683
(They are couple outfits.)

1685
01:02:37,683 --> 01:02:38,883
We have to wear them?

1686
01:02:39,883 --> 01:02:41,913
I can't believe you're making us do this.

1687
01:02:41,913 --> 01:02:43,013
- But...
 -  What's this?

1688
01:02:43,013 --> 01:02:45,283
- What is this?
 -  what will Kwang Soo and I do?

1689
01:02:45,283 --> 01:02:47,113
- Bo Ra can't see.
 -  That's your fate.

1690
01:02:47,113 --> 01:02:49,713
All right. It's the last game.

1691
01:02:49,713 --> 01:02:54,183
So far, Kwang Soo's team is winning.

1692
01:02:54,183 --> 01:02:56,013
- Oh dear.
 -  We will take you down.

1693
01:02:56,013 --> 01:02:57,083
Why?

1694
01:02:57,083 --> 01:02:58,643
Don't you know that you are our enemy today?

1695
01:02:58,643 --> 01:03:00,143
What are you talking about?

1696
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:02,543
All right. You will wear the couple outfit...

1697
01:03:02,543 --> 01:03:04,983
in the back...

1698
01:03:04,983 --> 01:03:06,813
and play Name Tag Elimination.

1699
01:03:06,813 --> 01:03:08,613
- It ends when one person wears out.
 -  Where is the name tag?

1700
01:03:08,613 --> 01:03:10,583
The name tags are on the outfit.

1701
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:12,643
- It's here.
 -  Two outfits are connected.

1702
01:03:12,643 --> 01:03:14,583
- Do we have to rip this whole?
 -  Oh dear.

1703
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:15,813
- It's tough.
 -  We have to rip this?

1704
01:03:15,813 --> 01:03:17,143
If this gets ripped, we're out.

1705
01:03:17,143 --> 01:03:19,983
Can you please put on the outfits?

1706
01:03:19,983 --> 01:03:21,043
- Okay.
 -  Okay.

1707
01:03:21,043 --> 01:03:23,143
- Let's do that.
 -  Can we choose any colour?

1708
01:03:23,813 --> 01:03:24,883
It's pink.

1709
01:03:24,883 --> 01:03:26,683
- Seriously.
 -  I think you should wear it first.

1710
01:03:26,683 --> 01:03:28,443
- This is...
 -  This is too tight.

1711
01:03:28,443 --> 01:03:30,113
- I will put my head in.
 -  This is really tight.

1712
01:03:30,443 --> 01:03:31,513
It's small.

1713
01:03:31,513 --> 01:03:33,983
(Everyone somehow puts it on.)

1714
01:03:33,983 --> 01:03:35,283
(But Bo Ra goes missing.)

1715
01:03:35,283 --> 01:03:36,543
Bo Ra can't get out!

1716
01:03:36,543 --> 01:03:37,913
What?

1717
01:03:37,913 --> 01:03:39,383
- Bo Ra.
 -  She's stuck.

1718
01:03:39,383 --> 01:03:40,713
- She can't come out.
 -  Poor girl.

1719
01:03:40,713 --> 01:03:43,443
Wait.

1720
01:03:43,443 --> 01:03:44,443
Bo Ra is here.

1721
01:03:45,383 --> 01:03:46,713
There's no other way.

1722
01:03:46,713 --> 01:03:48,983
- What are you doing?
 -  What are you doing? Help her.

1723
01:03:48,983 --> 01:03:51,243
- Bo Ra is here.
 -  Treat her nicely.

1724
01:03:52,013 --> 01:03:53,943
Kwang Soo, you should lower your body a bit.

1725
01:03:53,943 --> 01:03:55,783
- How?
 -  Kwang Soo's team will lose.

1726
01:03:55,783 --> 01:03:57,313
You want me to crawl around?

1727
01:03:57,313 --> 01:03:59,313
- There you go.
 -  You want me to crawl?

1728
01:03:59,313 --> 01:04:00,383
- You're done for.
 -  You're done for.

1729
01:04:00,383 --> 01:04:02,143
How can I play the game like this?

1730
01:04:02,143 --> 01:04:03,343
(He no longer is a winner.)

1731
01:04:03,343 --> 01:04:04,513
You're done for, Kwang Soo.

1732
01:04:04,513 --> 01:04:07,783
- What are you doing?
 -  They became weak.

1733
01:04:07,783 --> 01:04:09,543
- Help us.
 -  We're in trouble.

1734
01:04:09,543 --> 01:04:11,613
- They're in trouble.
 -  They look easy now.

1735
01:04:11,613 --> 01:04:13,813
- They were our target anyway.
 -  Good.

1736
01:04:13,813 --> 01:04:16,683
- With the points,
 -  What do we do with them?

1737
01:04:16,683 --> 01:04:19,113
You can purchase items that will give you advantage.

1738
01:04:19,113 --> 01:04:20,813
- I see.
 -  Items.

1739
01:04:20,813 --> 01:04:22,943
(Thank goodness we earned those points.)

1740
01:04:23,783 --> 01:04:25,043
(Points)

1741
01:04:25,043 --> 01:04:26,213
(List of Items)

1742
01:04:26,213 --> 01:04:27,543
(Five points equal one chance of revival.)

1743
01:04:27,543 --> 01:04:29,443
You will shop for items.

1744
01:04:29,443 --> 01:04:30,943
I will explain how it works.

1745
01:04:30,943 --> 01:04:34,183
You can only buy one item per category. Think wisely.

1746
01:04:34,183 --> 01:04:37,113
Take your outfits and go to the item store.

1747
01:04:37,113 --> 01:04:38,283
(List of Items)

1748
01:04:38,283 --> 01:04:39,443
This is good.

1749
01:04:40,013 --> 01:04:41,113
There's nothing else to buy.

1750
01:04:41,113 --> 01:04:42,113
(Kwang Soo's team buys the two best items.)

1751
01:04:42,113 --> 01:04:43,143
- How many are there?
 -  Four.

1752
01:04:43,143 --> 01:04:45,613
- Thank you.
 -  Revival Card?

1753
01:04:45,613 --> 01:04:46,613
Revival Card.

1754
01:04:46,943 --> 01:04:48,013
- There you go.
 -  Thank you.

1755
01:04:48,543 --> 01:04:50,513
Let's choose the middle one. We got the middle one.

1756
01:04:51,113 --> 01:04:52,183
Should we go with this?

1757
01:04:52,183 --> 01:04:53,443
Let's go with this.

1758
01:04:53,443 --> 01:04:55,113
If we had one more, we could've gotten the Revival Card.

1759
01:04:55,113 --> 01:04:56,943
Can we pay you? How much is it?

1760
01:04:56,943 --> 01:04:59,483
(The teams are finish purchasing their items.)

1761
01:05:00,683 --> 01:05:03,483
We will now begin the race.

1762
01:05:04,683 --> 01:05:06,283
I want to start now.

1763
01:05:06,283 --> 01:05:08,083
- I'm scared.
 -  Let's do this.

1764
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:09,313
- Three,
 -  Three.

1765
01:05:09,313 --> 01:05:11,013
Two, one.

1766
01:05:11,013 --> 01:05:12,243
The race starts.

1767
01:05:12,583 --> 01:05:13,943
I'm in trouble.

1768
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:16,183
- Can you see?
 -  I can.

1769
01:05:16,183 --> 01:05:17,183
I am sorry.

1770
01:05:17,183 --> 01:05:20,843
(They bought the chance to remove the wings.)

1771
01:05:21,513 --> 01:05:23,313
I'm not sure if going outside is a good thing.

1772
01:05:24,413 --> 01:05:25,513
It's probably a good thing, right?

1773
01:05:25,513 --> 01:05:27,083
Can we walk sideways?

1774
01:05:27,613 --> 01:05:29,513
I can see better this way.

1775
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:30,843
- Like this?
 -  I am sorry.

1776
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:32,013
(That's not an armpit, but a facepit.)

1777
01:05:32,013 --> 01:05:34,213
- Hi, friends.
 -  Hi.

1778
01:05:34,843 --> 01:05:36,213
It's the sexy couple.

1779
01:05:36,213 --> 01:05:38,613
(Ji Hyo's team purchased a smaller name tag.)

1780
01:05:38,613 --> 01:05:40,483
(Gary's team removed their wings.)

1781
01:05:40,943 --> 01:05:41,983
I'm your fan.

1782
01:05:41,983 --> 01:05:44,983
(Haha's team also removed their wings.)

1783
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:46,343
- Hello.
 -  Right now,

1784
01:05:46,343 --> 01:05:49,143
- You know, right?
 -  it looks like they can revive.

1785
01:05:49,143 --> 01:05:51,883
- I'm sure.
 -  I saw them taking scissors.

1786
01:05:51,883 --> 01:05:52,943
- Scissors?
 -  Yes.

1787
01:05:52,943 --> 01:05:55,813
- That means they cut the wings.
 -  We did that as well.

1788
01:05:56,213 --> 01:05:57,643
You know who we're eliminating after Kwang Soo, right?

1789
01:05:58,083 --> 01:05:59,513
- Jong Kook?
 -  Yes.

1790
01:05:59,513 --> 01:06:01,843
- Really?
 -  Then it's Jae Seok.

1791
01:06:01,843 --> 01:06:02,883
And then us three can remain.

1792
01:06:02,883 --> 01:06:04,083
- Then...
 -  All right.

1793
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:05,483
- You know, right?
 -  High-five.

1794
01:06:05,483 --> 01:06:08,043
- One, two, three.
 -  We can do it!

1795
01:06:08,043 --> 01:06:09,843
- You understand, right?
 -  We'll expose our back.

1796
01:06:09,843 --> 01:06:10,843
(3 couples with no points plot together.)

1797
01:06:12,283 --> 01:06:14,643
(It's still quiet on the 2nd floor.)

1798
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:16,083
Hey, friend!

1799
01:06:16,083 --> 01:06:19,213
(Jong Kook's team removed their wings, too.)

1800
01:06:19,913 --> 01:06:20,913
Hey, friends!

1801
01:06:21,343 --> 01:06:23,543
- Hey.
 -  We are friends.

1802
01:06:23,543 --> 01:06:25,313
- For now.
 -  Yes, for now.

1803
01:06:25,313 --> 01:06:26,313
About Kwang Soo's team...

1804
01:06:26,313 --> 01:06:29,583
(Jae Seok's team switched to a smaller name tag.)

1805
01:06:29,583 --> 01:06:31,483
- Let's get rid of Kwang Soo.
 -  Let's do it.

1806
01:06:31,483 --> 01:06:34,143
- Even if we're at risk,
 -  Of course.

1807
01:06:34,143 --> 01:06:35,543
- let's not attack each other.
 -  Of course.

1808
01:06:35,543 --> 01:06:37,643
- Seriously.
 -  I'm being serious.

1809
01:06:37,643 --> 01:06:39,113
I think Kwang Soo is upstairs.

1810
01:06:39,113 --> 01:06:42,213
(They still can't trust each other so they walk backwards.)

1811
01:06:42,813 --> 01:06:44,483
I think this is a better idea.

1812
01:06:44,483 --> 01:06:45,943
Let's face each other.

1813
01:06:45,943 --> 01:06:48,213
- Let's do that.
 -  Right?

1814
01:06:48,213 --> 01:06:53,113
- You never know.
 -  Your instincts may crawl up.

1815
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:57,343
Kwang Soo, the elevator is moving.

1816
01:06:57,983 --> 01:06:59,743
- Let's go to the third floor.
 -  Let's go.

1817
01:06:59,743 --> 01:07:02,043
(With the facepit's guidance, they flee the scene.)

1818
01:07:02,043 --> 01:07:04,743
What now? I'm scared.

1819
01:07:04,743 --> 01:07:06,253
Should we hide here?

1820
01:07:06,253 --> 01:07:07,583
We're dead if we get caught.

1821
01:07:08,083 --> 01:07:09,513
- This is the third floor.
 -  No, no.

1822
01:07:09,513 --> 01:07:10,913
- It's the third floor.
 -  Is it?

1823
01:07:11,243 --> 01:07:13,183
Does "PH" stand for "penthouse"?

1824
01:07:13,183 --> 01:07:14,983
(The two teams get off on the 3rd floor.)

1825
01:07:14,983 --> 01:07:16,183
Wait, this floor...

1826
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:18,183
You have to watch your back.

1827
01:07:18,183 --> 01:07:19,383
I'll look.

1828
01:07:20,413 --> 01:07:23,034
- We should defend each other.
 -  Of course.

1829
01:07:23,034 --> 01:07:25,860
- I don't think they're here.
 -  I'm sure Kwang Soo's here.

1830
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:27,070
They're hiding.

1831
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:28,543
Where is Kwang Soo?

1832
01:07:29,283 --> 01:07:31,443
- Hey, look here.
 -  Hey, hey.

1833
01:07:32,213 --> 01:07:33,613
There...

1834
01:07:33,613 --> 01:07:35,356
- Was there something outside?
 -  Where could they be?

1835
01:07:35,356 --> 01:07:36,843
- Hold on.
 -  Are they outside?

1836
01:07:36,843 --> 01:07:38,403
Are they out in the rain?

1837
01:07:38,403 --> 01:07:40,813
I think they went out in the rain to hide themselves.

1838
01:07:41,713 --> 01:07:43,643
I know Kwang Soo would do that.

1839
01:07:44,043 --> 01:07:45,614
- I don't care if I get wet.
 -  Jae Seok.

1840
01:07:45,614 --> 01:07:47,713
- I'll go check if they're outside.
 -  Yell if you see them.

1841
01:07:47,713 --> 01:07:48,743
- Okay.
 -  Okay.

1842
01:07:48,743 --> 01:07:49,843
- Right away, okay?
 -  Okay.

1843
01:07:52,043 --> 01:07:54,113
- They have to be here.
 -  Where else would they go?

1844
01:07:54,113 --> 01:07:55,813
(Jae Seok's team set off in the rain.)

1845
01:07:55,813 --> 01:07:57,113
It's 100 percent.

1846
01:07:57,113 --> 01:07:58,913
- They're here!
 -  Hey! They're here!

1847
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:00,663
Kwang Soo's team is here!

1848
01:08:00,663 --> 01:08:03,513
(They find Kwang Soo's team soaked in the rain.)

1849
01:08:04,983 --> 01:08:07,443
(Go get Kwang Soo!)

1850
01:08:08,643 --> 01:08:10,743
I can't see what's in front of me!

1851
01:08:12,683 --> 01:08:13,813
Let's go get Kwang Soo.

1852
01:08:14,243 --> 01:08:15,913
(The facepit is drenched.)

1853
01:08:15,913 --> 01:08:17,890
I feel so bad for myself.

1854
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:19,353
Did you have to come this far?

1855
01:08:20,713 --> 01:08:22,790
- Hurry up!
 -  Hurry!

1856
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:25,143
- Hurry!
 -  Let's go.

1857
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:26,513
(The other three teams join as well.)

1858
01:08:26,513 --> 01:08:28,613
- There they are.
 -  Hurry up!

1859
01:08:29,243 --> 01:08:30,743
- Let's do this fairly.
 -  Save me.

1860
01:08:30,743 --> 01:08:31,913
- We're in the rain!
 -  Come here!

1861
01:08:31,913 --> 01:08:34,543
- I can't use my right hand.
 -  My back hurts.

1862
01:08:36,113 --> 01:08:37,813
(Jong Kook grabs the name tag.)

1863
01:08:37,813 --> 01:08:39,750
No! Bo Ra!

1864
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:42,283
- Bo Ra! Bo Ra!
 -  Rip it.

1865
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:48,013
(They managed to come this far despite the height difference.)

1866
01:08:49,113 --> 01:08:50,521
I ripped it.

1867
01:08:50,521 --> 01:08:52,243
Good job. Yes!

1868
01:08:52,243 --> 01:08:55,063
- We got Kwang Soo.
 -  We did.

1869
01:08:55,063 --> 01:08:56,931
- I did it.
 -  Bo Ra looks tortured.

1870
01:08:56,931 --> 01:08:58,113
- I almost threw up.
 -  Leave me alone.

1871
01:08:58,113 --> 01:08:59,783
(She's guilty for meeting a partner who's 190cm tall.)

1872
01:08:59,783 --> 01:09:01,613
- I can't do this any more.
 -  I'm sorry, Bo Ra.

1873
01:09:01,943 --> 01:09:03,213
I'm sorry, Bo Ra.

1874
01:09:03,213 --> 01:09:05,013
(Everybody's enemy team is removed.)

1875
01:09:05,783 --> 01:09:07,983
Kwang Soo and Bo Ra are out.

1876
01:09:09,413 --> 01:09:10,513
How could this happen?

1877
01:09:11,043 --> 01:09:13,213
What are we supposed to do? Should we crawl?

1878
01:09:13,213 --> 01:09:14,353
(They get ready to use the Revival Card.)

1879
01:09:14,353 --> 01:09:16,283
You can go now.

1880
01:09:16,283 --> 01:09:18,243
- I feel like they are outside.
 -  Let me take a look.

1881
01:09:19,383 --> 01:09:20,743
I'm pretty sure.

1882
01:09:21,213 --> 01:09:22,783
They're waiting to hunt us down.

1883
01:09:22,783 --> 01:09:24,853
(Who are the people outside, waiting to hunt us down?)

1884
01:09:26,713 --> 01:09:29,413
(Everybody's assembled.)

1885
01:09:29,413 --> 01:09:31,583
(Oh, hi there.)

1886
01:09:33,283 --> 01:09:34,813
What are we... Hold on.

1887
01:09:34,813 --> 01:09:36,424
- Come here, please.
 -  Let's talk.

1888
01:09:36,424 --> 01:09:37,883
We're going to revive.

1889
01:09:37,883 --> 01:09:40,313
- We're going to come out.
 -  Give us one chance.

1890
01:09:40,313 --> 01:09:41,813
Why are we your target?

1891
01:09:41,813 --> 01:09:44,483
- Come out first.
 -  We will come out.

1892
01:09:44,483 --> 01:09:45,683
Dress yourselves first.

1893
01:09:45,683 --> 01:09:47,956
We're going to do that but why are you doing this?

1894
01:09:47,956 --> 01:09:50,353
- Come out.
 -  We already lost five points!

1895
01:09:51,443 --> 01:09:52,727
We have nothing!

1896
01:09:52,727 --> 01:09:54,213
Why are you even hiding?

1897
01:09:54,713 --> 01:09:56,443
We're not hiding. We're just waiting.

1898
01:09:58,083 --> 01:10:00,143
- Oh, is that true?
 -  We're just waiting.

1899
01:10:01,283 --> 01:10:04,353
- What did I do so wrong?
 -  It must be my fault.

1900
01:10:04,353 --> 01:10:06,083
It's fun when things don't go his way.

1901
01:10:06,813 --> 01:10:08,887
Can I not use the Revival Card?

1902
01:10:08,887 --> 01:10:10,813
Then, it ends here.

1903
01:10:10,813 --> 01:10:12,013
- It's the end?
 -  Yes.

1904
01:10:13,913 --> 01:10:16,113
What am I supposed to do then?

1905
01:10:16,113 --> 01:10:17,183
(They're done for either way.)

1906
01:10:17,183 --> 01:10:18,853
We need the slightest hope.

1907
01:10:18,853 --> 01:10:20,083
(You'll receive your prize later for calling back first.)

1908
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:21,713
I don't think they plan on coming out.

1909
01:10:21,713 --> 01:10:24,183
(The 5 couples watch for an opportunity to attack.)

1910
01:10:26,183 --> 01:10:27,883
- They're out.
 -  They're back.

1911
01:10:28,413 --> 01:10:29,513
Come this way.

1912
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,213
- Look at them.
 -  We have to get out of here.

1913
01:10:32,913 --> 01:10:34,413
(Stumbling)

1914
01:10:34,413 --> 01:10:36,513
(They take themselves down.)

1915
01:10:37,613 --> 01:10:38,643
(Ripping)

1916
01:10:39,353 --> 01:10:40,413
(Ji Hyo's team spots an opportunity.)

1917
01:10:40,413 --> 01:10:41,483
- My gosh.
 -  You're done.

1918
01:10:41,483 --> 01:10:42,743
Give us a chance.

1919
01:10:43,483 --> 01:10:45,443
- Look at Bo Ra.
 -  Poor Bo Ra.

1920
01:10:45,443 --> 01:10:47,693
- Shownu's got it.
 -  Shownu!

1921
01:10:47,693 --> 01:10:49,483
I'll let you go.

1922
01:10:50,883 --> 01:10:52,913
(Ripping)

1923
01:10:53,853 --> 01:10:55,713
(What's the point of coming in 1st place?)

1924
01:10:55,713 --> 01:10:58,350
(They're the 1st to get eliminated.)

1925
01:10:58,350 --> 01:11:02,693
(Kwang Soo and Bo Ra are out.)

1926
01:11:02,693 --> 01:11:05,413
Let's have a truce until we eliminate Jong Kook.

1927
01:11:06,043 --> 01:11:08,083
- Can the books come in first?
 -  Come in.

1928
01:11:08,083 --> 01:11:09,583
Are you an encyclopedia or something?

1929
01:11:10,713 --> 01:11:11,713
Where are they?

1930
01:11:12,283 --> 01:11:13,353
They must be hiding.

1931
01:11:14,083 --> 01:11:15,563
(They hide themselves in a blind spot.)

1932
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:16,913
I hope they don't jump out of nowhere.

1933
01:11:16,913 --> 01:11:18,143
- I know where they are.
 -  They're behind a wall.

1934
01:11:18,143 --> 01:11:20,113
- They were hiding there before.
 -  The corner, right?

1935
01:11:20,113 --> 01:11:22,713
- It's by the corner.
 -  That's the only hiding spot.

1936
01:11:22,713 --> 01:11:24,420
Let's have one team go towards the elevator.

1937
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:26,883
- You can go ahead.
 -  Let's do this.

1938
01:11:26,883 --> 01:11:28,783
Yell as soon as you see them.

1939
01:11:28,783 --> 01:11:32,883
(Welcome to the tiger's den.)

1940
01:11:32,883 --> 01:11:34,513
- They're not here.
 -  Go that way.

1941
01:11:34,513 --> 01:11:35,734
Go towards the robot experience hall.

1942
01:11:35,734 --> 01:11:38,013
(Roaring)

1943
01:11:39,383 --> 01:11:42,853
(Their target is Jae Seok's team, who's the furthest from the group.)

1944
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:46,313
(Shrieking)

1945
01:11:46,313 --> 01:11:47,443
Producer.

1946
01:11:48,043 --> 01:11:50,643
(Thanks to Jae Seok's quick reflexes, Jong Kook fails.)

1947
01:11:50,643 --> 01:11:52,483
We made a truce with the other teams.

1948
01:11:52,483 --> 01:11:54,043
- Be careful.
 -  No wonder...

1949
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:55,113
it didn't feel right.

1950
01:11:55,113 --> 01:11:57,680
- Thank goodness we're in a group.
 -  We came too far.

1951
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:58,783
- My goodness.
 -  My gosh.

1952
01:11:58,783 --> 01:12:01,013
- I was shocked.
 -  This is shocking.

1953
01:12:02,583 --> 01:12:04,283
- Attack him.
 -  What are you waiting for?

1954
01:12:04,283 --> 01:12:05,853
(This is the only time they become generous.)

1955
01:12:05,853 --> 01:12:06,883
We'll go here, then.

1956
01:12:06,883 --> 01:12:08,383
- Come here.
 -  Let's switch.

1957
01:12:08,383 --> 01:12:10,143
- Hold on tight.
 -  Should we go to the open space?

1958
01:12:10,143 --> 01:12:12,013
No, we'll go where we were before.

1959
01:12:12,013 --> 01:12:13,983
- Here?
 -  They were waiting there?

1960
01:12:14,713 --> 01:12:17,943
We said we'll do this, so let's go.

1961
01:12:17,943 --> 01:12:19,443
Let's yell while we attack.

1962
01:12:19,443 --> 01:12:22,013
- One, two...
 -  You are ready, right?

1963
01:12:22,353 --> 01:12:23,643
- One, two, three.
 -  One, two, three.

1964
01:12:24,083 --> 01:12:26,413
(Yelling)

1965
01:12:26,413 --> 01:12:28,913
(It's all or nothing.)

1966
01:12:30,283 --> 01:12:33,713
(Let's have a real match!)

1967
01:12:34,443 --> 01:12:37,656
- Ouch, So You!
 -  Pull us back!

1968
01:12:37,656 --> 01:12:39,513
She's so strong. I'm not even lying.

1969
01:12:39,853 --> 01:12:41,143
- Let go.
 -  Ouch.

1970
01:12:41,813 --> 01:12:44,353
(Heavy-ho!)

1971
01:12:44,353 --> 01:12:46,243
- It's not working.
 -  Rip it!

1972
01:12:46,243 --> 01:12:49,143
(They manage to pull them out of the corner.)

1973
01:12:49,483 --> 01:12:50,743
One, two.

1974
01:12:50,743 --> 01:12:55,643
(3 couples hold onto them while Seok Jin attacks.)

1975
01:12:57,583 --> 01:12:59,183
(Ripping)

1976
01:13:00,813 --> 01:13:04,383
(Jong Kook and So You are finally out.)

1977
01:13:06,353 --> 01:13:07,743
Look what happened.

1978
01:13:07,743 --> 01:13:09,213
We can't do this alone.

1979
01:13:09,213 --> 01:13:10,366
- We can't.
 -  I agree.

1980
01:13:10,366 --> 01:13:11,853
So You is so strong.

1981
01:13:11,853 --> 01:13:13,013
She is.

1982
01:13:13,013 --> 01:13:15,143
- I think she's stronger than me.
 -  She's a man.

1983
01:13:19,643 --> 01:13:21,643
Jong Kook and So You are out.

1984
01:13:21,643 --> 01:13:23,983
- Jong Kook is out.
 -  What happened? They teamed up.

1985
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:25,973
- It serves him right.
 -  Exactly.

1986
01:13:25,973 --> 01:13:27,483
- That's good to hear.
 -  I'm so happy.

1987
01:13:28,283 --> 01:13:30,043
I can finally sleep in ease.

1988
01:13:31,013 --> 01:13:32,383
I feel so much better now.

1989
01:13:32,383 --> 01:13:33,683
Jae Seok is next.

1990
01:13:34,113 --> 01:13:35,383
He has the second most points.

1991
01:13:35,883 --> 01:13:37,743
How lame.

1992
01:13:38,713 --> 01:13:40,783
- Think about this.
 -  Is he next?

1993
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:41,883
Hold on. Come on.

1994
01:13:42,243 --> 01:13:44,043
This is what's meant to happen.

1995
01:13:44,043 --> 01:13:45,943
(As planned, they go for Jae Seok this time.)

1996
01:13:45,943 --> 01:13:50,743
(Yelling once again, they pull Jae Seok's team out.)

1997
01:13:52,183 --> 01:13:53,643
(Ripping)

1998
01:13:55,383 --> 01:13:58,313
(I can't let them eliminate us.)

1999
01:13:59,583 --> 01:14:02,513
(However)

2000
01:14:02,513 --> 01:14:04,213
(Ripping)

2001
01:14:06,013 --> 01:14:07,113
I ripped it!

2002
01:14:08,183 --> 01:14:09,643
Did you rip it?

2003
01:14:09,643 --> 01:14:11,113
- My gosh.
 -  Where?

2004
01:14:11,913 --> 01:14:16,613
(The alliance betrays them.)

2005
01:14:18,383 --> 01:14:23,013
(Jong Kook and Jae Seok's teams are out.)

2006
01:14:24,353 --> 01:14:25,613
What did I tell you, Jae Seok?

2007
01:14:25,613 --> 01:14:27,860
I told you that you're next!

2008
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:30,043
- Listen.
 -  Oh, dear.

2009
01:14:30,443 --> 01:14:32,083
I hope you're not mistaken.

2010
01:14:32,083 --> 01:14:33,980
Did you think you would last forever?

2011
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:35,913
Look at these people.

2012
01:14:35,913 --> 01:14:37,353
The diamond rings are out of reach.

2013
01:14:37,353 --> 01:14:39,313
(What? Why is Seok Jin out?)

2014
01:14:40,443 --> 01:14:42,983
(1 minute after Jae Seok's elimination)

2015
01:14:43,913 --> 01:14:47,043
(Ji Hyo and Gary's teams team up and eliminated Seok Jin's team.)

2016
01:14:47,043 --> 01:14:49,413
- I'm so mad.
 -  Me, too.

2017
01:14:49,413 --> 01:14:51,813
(What goes around comes around.)

2018
01:14:51,813 --> 01:14:52,983
I should have teamed up with Jae Seok.

2019
01:14:52,983 --> 01:14:55,326
Why would you... You always do this.

2020
01:14:55,326 --> 01:14:56,783
He always does this.

2021
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:58,183
(It's too late now.)

2022
01:14:59,853 --> 01:15:01,213
It's a food chain.

2023
01:15:01,683 --> 01:15:03,483
That's true. There's no alliance.

2024
01:15:03,883 --> 01:15:05,983
- He's strong.
 -  Shownu?

2025
01:15:05,983 --> 01:15:07,143
- He is.
 -  He's so strong.

2026
01:15:07,143 --> 01:15:08,583
- Shownu...
 -  He works out a lot.

2027
01:15:08,943 --> 01:15:10,213
We couldn't drag Jong Kook out,

2028
01:15:10,213 --> 01:15:12,283
but with Shownu's help, we could do it.

2029
01:15:12,283 --> 01:15:13,613
He's incredible.

2030
01:15:14,783 --> 01:15:16,013
I guess it's not over yet.

2031
01:15:16,683 --> 01:15:17,983
- That's Gary's voice.
 -  It is.

2032
01:15:17,983 --> 01:15:19,783
- I guess Gary is being cornered.
 -  I want to see it.

2033
01:15:20,143 --> 01:15:21,643
- Oh, dear.
 -  Hey!

2034
01:15:21,643 --> 01:15:23,943
(Shownu power is seen once again.)

2035
01:15:23,943 --> 01:15:27,443
(Gary's team is in danger!)

2036
01:15:27,443 --> 01:15:28,543
- No way!
 -  No!

2037
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:31,813
(They try their best to resist.)

2038
01:15:33,853 --> 01:15:35,313
(Ripping)

2039
01:15:37,013 --> 01:15:42,183
(Ji Hyo and Shownu are the winners.)

2040
01:15:43,143 --> 01:15:44,914
- What is it?
 -  How did it go?

2041
01:15:44,914 --> 01:15:45,983
Is it Gary and Hyo Lyn?

2042
01:15:45,983 --> 01:15:47,183
Ji Hyo won again.

2043
01:15:47,883 --> 01:15:49,513
(Ji Hyo is good in big games.)

2044
01:15:49,513 --> 01:15:51,213
- They're too strong.
 -  They're unbeatable.

2045
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:54,083
(Shownu's power is invincible.)

2046
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:56,887
We should applaud for Gary and Hyo Lyn.

2047
01:15:56,887 --> 01:15:59,213
Hyo Lyn, can you please go out with Gary?

2048
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:02,383
- Even if it's for one month.
 -  Please.

2049
01:16:02,383 --> 01:16:04,353
- Just for a month.
 -  You look great together.

2050
01:16:04,353 --> 01:16:06,783
So the winners for today...

2051
01:16:07,213 --> 01:16:09,350
Shownu pulled through.

2052
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:10,613
The winners are Shownu and Ji Hyo!

2053
01:16:10,613 --> 01:16:13,313
(Shownu and Ji Hyo are today's winners.)

2054
01:16:13,683 --> 01:16:15,143
- He's strong.
 -  He's different.

2055
01:16:15,143 --> 01:16:16,883
- They're sweating.
 -  Shownu is so good.

2056
01:16:16,883 --> 01:16:18,166
(Shownu is the MVP.)

2057
01:16:18,166 --> 01:16:21,083
- Look.
 -  My goodness!

2058
01:16:21,083 --> 01:16:23,783
- Ji Hyo has some already.
 -  Goodness.

2059
01:16:23,783 --> 01:16:26,013
She always wins when there are prizes.

2060
01:16:26,013 --> 01:16:27,513
- She must be lucky.
 -  You know what?

2061
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:30,513
Today, I received a bigger diamond than that.

2062
01:16:31,213 --> 01:16:33,643
(The name of the diamond is Hyo Lyn.)

2063
01:16:33,643 --> 01:16:34,883
It's "Hyo Ring".

2064
01:16:35,643 --> 01:16:37,283
- "Hyo Ring".
 -  "Hyo Ring".

2065
01:16:37,283 --> 01:16:39,113
(Hyo Lyn is more precious to Gary than a diamond ring is.)

2066
01:16:39,613 --> 01:16:42,150
Can you show us your dance again before we finish?

2067
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:43,883
- Dance!
 -  Dance!

2068
01:16:43,883 --> 01:16:46,584
- Dance! Dance!
 -  It's embarrassing.

2069
01:16:46,584 --> 01:16:48,313
One, two, three, four!

2070
01:16:48,783 --> 01:16:51,283
(Dancing)

2071
01:16:52,443 --> 01:16:56,383
(Have a good Sunday night and see you next week.)

2072
01:16:56,713 --> 01:16:57,904
Hello.

2073
01:16:57,904 --> 01:16:59,473
(Don't forget me.)

2074
01:16:59,473 --> 01:17:00,770
Good to see you, Hee Ae.

2075
01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:02,143
(The unforgettable queen, Kim Hee Ae)

2076
01:17:03,243 --> 01:17:04,673
Yes, Hee Ae showed up. So what?

2077
01:17:04,673 --> 01:17:06,213
"Hee Ae"? Am I a friend of yours?

2078
01:17:06,883 --> 01:17:08,183
That's funny.

2079
01:17:08,183 --> 01:17:10,543
(We get to see the unexpected sides to her.)

2080
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:13,846
(She leaves everything behind and joins Running Man.)

2081
01:17:13,846 --> 01:17:15,880
So what if something happens?

2082
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:17,613
(So a man full of doubts has joined.)

2083
01:17:18,583 --> 01:17:20,603
(The queen's man, Ji Jin Hee)

2084
01:17:20,603 --> 01:17:22,203
- Why is he acting strange?
 -  That's so odd.

2085
01:17:22,203 --> 01:17:25,913
(Everything is suspicious. Everything is strange.)

2086
01:17:25,913 --> 01:17:29,083
(With all the doubts and suspicions, they face the truth in the end.)

2087
01:17:29,913 --> 01:17:32,713
(Special Agent H)
