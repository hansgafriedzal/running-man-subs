1
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:07,579
(Running Man's late summer blockbuster)

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,860
Why am I going to prison?

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,630
(Survive until the end.)

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,930
(Do not go to the end.)

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,960
I'm not going to prison. No way.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,730
What prison? I don't want to go to prison.

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:19,860
(Train to Prison)

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,400
I'm going to Jeonju. Why are you doing this?

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,300
Prison? Prison? Prison?

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,600
(A sunny day in late summer at Suseo Station)

11
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,230
Should I sit down?

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,360
(Are they going on a trip by train?)

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,460
Really?

14
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:33,960
(7 years of Running Man tells me there's something going on.)

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,360
What's all this?

16
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,960
- Hello. - Hello.

17
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,300
(What's going on?)

18
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,400
Here we are at Suseo Station.

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,760
- This train station will open... - KTX.

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,800
I know that.

21
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,960
- And start operating soon. - Oh, I see.

22
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,830
The trains bound for Gwangju and Jeolla-do will stop here, right?

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,060
Today, we are going on a leisure trip departing here.

24
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,600
We'll go on a leisure trip.

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,800
- A leisure trip? - Do you really mean it?

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,460
You get to choose the destinations.

27
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,260
(A journey on a train that will take you to wherever you want? )

28
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,560
We'll go wherever you want to go.

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,030
- A leisure trip? - Do you really mean it?

30
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,330
(The mountains and the oceans are calling us.)

31
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,660
So anywhere is fine?

32
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,430
Yes, as long as we can go by train.

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,700
If you say it like that, then I'm not sure where to go.

34
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,500
- How about Mokpo? - Mokpo sounds good.

35
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,960
- Small octopus, small octopus. - Let's eat small octopus there.

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,630
Mokpo is famous for delicious food.

37
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,030
Since Mokpo is a harbour city,

38
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,930
we should also go to the beach when it's still summer.

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,200
(Romantic, late summer beach)

40
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,260
(Wait, if it's the west...)

41
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,200
- Jeonju is also a good choice. - I want to go to Jeonju.

42
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,100
Jeonju is famous for kongnamul gukbap.

43
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,130
There are lots of great restaurants there.

44
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,930
(How about we feel the essence of quiet and peaceful Korean charm?)

45
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,830
How about Yeosu?

46
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,200
Night sea at Yeosu

47
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,430
(How about enjoying the scenery of the beautiful port in Yeosu?)

48
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,630
- Where should we go? - Where should we go?

49
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,160
I say Mokpo is the place to go.

50
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,500
- Jeonju. We should go to Jeonju. - Let's go to Mokpo for the octopus.

51
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,930
- What's all this? - I like Jeonju since it's close.

52
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,230
- What? - Hello.

53
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,300
(Guards enter with huge train tickets.)

54
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,030
Are we writing down where we want to go?

55
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,830
- Have you all decided? - Yes.

56
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,200
You just write your destination on the tickets and show us.

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,260
All right.

58
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,660
- Where do you want to go? - Me?

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,430
I want to visit Jeonju.

60
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,460
I'll choose somewhere close.

61
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,760
Does the train stop at Yeosu, as well?

62
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,000
(The walls break.)

63
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,030
Why? What's wrong? What?

64
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,130
(They are attacked by strangers.)

65
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,930
- What? Why? - Why are you doing this?

66
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,430
(Gary is forced to write something.)

67
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,430
- Why are you doing this? - What's happening?

68
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,830
(Are they being forced to write their destinations?)

69
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,930
- You're driving me crazy! - Hold on for a moment!

70
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,700
- You are making me go crazy! - I'm going to Yeosu!

71
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,900
I said, I'm going to Yeosu!

72
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,800
I'm going to Jeonju!

73
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,960
- What is this? - Let go. I want to go to Jeonju.

74
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,060
(Jong Kook is still resisting.)

75
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,400
(They are forced to write their destinations.)

76
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,060
- What is this? - I don't want to go there.

77
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,530
I don't want to go to prison! Why would you send me to prison?

78
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,960
Prison?

79
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,460
(Prison?)

80
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,530
(What's going on?)

81
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,730
- Prison? - Why did you write that down?

82
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,300
- Why would we go to prison? - Somebody help me.

83
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,460
(Is prison the final destination of the leisure trip?)

84
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,830
- Not me! - Why are you doing this to me?

85
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,500
(You said we could go anywhere.)

86
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,930
- What is this? - I'm not going to prison.

87
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,930
Why would I go to prison?

88
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,130
- I'm not going there. - I wanted to go to Jeonju.

89
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,930
I see that everybody wants to go to prison.

90
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,400
(All seven members wrote down "prison" as their destination.)

91
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,160
This isn't democratic.

92
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,260
- You will all go to prison. - What is this?

93
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,100
(Are you kidding me?)

94
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,860
You went over the line.

95
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,630
- Prison? - Don't mess around with us.

96
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,500
- Start talking. - Are you crazy?

97
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,200
That's what you wrote down.

98
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,100
We've prepared costumes that suit your destination.

99
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,130
- Please get changed. - Is this a joke?

100
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,500
- Are we wearing prison uniforms? - I can't believe this.

101
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,560
I thought they were the station staff members.

102
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,860
(What an absurd situation.)

103
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,200
(Will they be sent to prison now?)

104
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,560
(They start getting changed.)

105
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,060
This isn't even the right size.

106
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,460
(They're all the same size.)

107
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,200
Prisoners don't ask for things like that.

108
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,830
- We're prisoners after all. - This is violating my human rights.

109
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,030
What is this?

110
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,860
The pants look comfortable.

111
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,900
These are the refrigerator pants.

112
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,030
(The train to prison awaits.)

113
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,560
Everyone, you wrote down prison as the desired destination.

114
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,260
- When did we want to go to prison? - They're bullies.

115
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,530
- He's a tyrant. - The final destination is prison.

116
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,460
Before you arrive at the prison,

117
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,630
there might be a chance to escape.

118
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,760
Oh, really?

119
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,560
If you fail to escape and end up in prison,

120
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,300
you will serve the community...

121
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,260
by appearing on live television during Chuseok holidays.

122
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,400
(Live television on Chuseok?)

123
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,630
Did you say Chuseok?

124
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,860
You will be appearing on live television.

125
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,930
- I'm here at the Seoul Tollgate. - How does traffic look?

126
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,330
There is increasing traffic on the road.

127
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,800
The traffic on the highways is congested to the maximum level.

128
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,230
I already bought tickets for the vacation.

129
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,760
- Are you serious? - This is not good.

130
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,600
Going live on air is a big deal.

131
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,630
(It's the biggest penalty there is.)

132
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,100
(We have to escape.)

133
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,730
(Suseo Station)

134
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,060
(10 minutes before the departure of Train to Prison)

135
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,900
It's a leisure trip to prison.

136
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,960
(They didn't know it would come to this.)

137
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,730
(Escaping is the only solution.)

138
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,000
(They won't let us escape that easily.)

139
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,230
(They are moving to the platform where the Train to Prison awaits.)

140
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,230
Isn't that Lee Seul?

141
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,230
- What's she doing over there? - It's Lee Seul.

142
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,230
Why is she here?

143
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,060
What is Lee Seul doing here?

144
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,830
What are you doing here?

145
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,160
Oh, you got a job here? I haven't seen you in a long time.

146
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,800
Are these the numbers for our seats?

147
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,730
- We're supposed to sit there? - Yes.

148
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
What is this place?

149
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,760
(What?)

150
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,200
- Wait. - We're not alone.

151
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,400
(There are other people on the train.)

152
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,460
This is like a transportation vehicle for prisoners.

153
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,030
We're not the only prisoners.

154
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,400
I'm 7B.

155
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,830
- Where's 7B? - Where am I?

156
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,630
- This is mine right here. - I'm 9B.

157
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,730
I'm 10C.

158
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,460
I'm scared.

159
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,460
(Laughing)

160
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,100
9C.

161
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,460
I'm beside a gangster.

162
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,630
(Oh, no.)

163
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,200
(Haha has to sit beside a scary looking prisoner.)

164
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,660
He's not a gangster.

165
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,930
He got in here for urinating in public.

166
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,830
Oh, my.

167
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,930
Hello.

168
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,860
(Don't talk to me.)

169
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,300
Ladies and gentlemen, we would like to welcome you aboard.

170
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,630
(He's anxious.)

171
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,130
There's even an announcement.

172
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,100
You will be able to escape the train...

173
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,460
if all members work together and successfully complete the missions.

174
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,660
- We have to work together. - We are a team.

175
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,960
We have good teamwork.

176
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,130
We're working together.

177
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,560
We will do our best to make the trip safe and sound.

178
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,400
The train will be leaving soon.

179
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,560
(Enjoy your ride. The train will be leaving soon.)

180
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,460
(Running Man "Train to Prison")

181
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,660
(There's a mission for every carriage.)

182
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,060
(Quick-witted carriage)

183
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,000
(Bedazzling carriage)

184
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,100
(Passing carriage)

185
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,000
(Probability carriage)

186
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,000
(If they fail a mission, they will advance to the next carriage.)

187
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,400
(It means they will have higher chances of ending up in prison.)

188
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,630
We didn't do anything wrong.

189
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,560
We didn't commit any crime. There wasn't a court hearing.

190
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,360
One law for the rich and another for the poor.

191
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,860
(Close your mouth.)

192
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,730
(It's silent.)

193
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,060
(We shouldn't play around in here.)

194
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,630
(He's shaking his legs.)

195
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,760
I'm sorry, but can you cut that out?

196
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,160
- It's bothering me. - What was that?

197
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Come on.

198
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,360
- Is there something wrong? - He keeps shaking his legs.

199
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,130
(Who is?)

200
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,530
- What? - Is this your first time?

201
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,960
- I'm sorry? - He has a line.

202
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,130
I didn't know he had a line.

203
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,660
- I didn't know he had a line. - Me neither.

204
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,130
The person next to me looks like he committed an economic crime.

205
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,030
- You're right. - He doesn't look the violent type.

206
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,000
- It must have been corporate crime. - I see.

207
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,060
What's this?

208
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,800
Gary's partner looks much better than him.

209
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,270
Can I get a different prisoner?

210
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,560
Can I get Haha's prisoner instead?

211
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,000
Gary, can you take off the hat for a second?

212
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,230
- Wow. - You look like you belong here.

213
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,860
You look like a real prisoner.

214
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,430
I thought this was the real prison for a second.

215
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,460
- Gary is for real. - That's hilarious.

216
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,560
(He only needs to take off the hat.)

217
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,130
(The train is quietly making its way to prison.)

218
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,270
- Oh, it's starting. - Finally.

219
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,560
(Is it a mission?)

220
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,130
We will now begin the mission of the quick-witted carriage.

221
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,160
Quick-witted carriage?

222
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,460
(What's that?)

223
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,400
This carriage is a quick-witted carriage.

224
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,900
Only the quick-witted will be able to escape.

225
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,500
Survive the game of Blue and White Flag.

226
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,830
- What? - Quick-witted carriage?

227
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,030
(Did she say quick-witted?)

228
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,330
- Window seats, stand up. - One.

229
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,330
What did she say?

230
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,360
(Window seats, stand up.)

231
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,400
- What? - Aisle seats, sit down.

232
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,360
Aisle seats, don't stand up. Window seats, stand up.

233
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,230
- Window seats should stand. - I see.

234
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,130
Window seats, don't stand up. 10A stand up.

235
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,230
(10A is supposed to stand up.)

236
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,830
(He casually takes a seat.)

237
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,100
10A has failed the mission.

238
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,230
- Who is 10A? - What are you doing?

239
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,800
He's out?

240
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,830
What is this? How can you be so shameless?

241
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,400
- We failed already? - He has no muscles.

242
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,270
- Is he being dragged out? - Is that what happens when we fail?

243
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,770
- That's it? - He's out just like that?

244
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,130
- What is this? - What is this?

245
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,830
Did he do that on purpose?

246
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,060
He just took off.

247
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,500
He didn't even care.

248
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,200
(Nobody knows what will happen in the Train to Prison.)

249
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,200
Did we fail?

250
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,630
Focus.

251
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,030
The mission will start again.

252
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,560
- Be quiet, I can't hear her. - Okay.

253
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,800
Row 7, don't stand up. Row 10, stand up.

254
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,260
10D has failed the mission.

255
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,530
Are you kidding me?

256
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,600
(What's up with this guy?)

257
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,700
What happened?

258
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,330
Are you a hacker?

259
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,030
- I thought he was the brain. - He's clearly not.

260
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,760
- He didn't fail on purpose, did he? - I think he did it on purpose.

261
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,860
- That can't be. - They seriously failed?

262
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,460
- He was serious. - He didn't know how to play.

263
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,960
The mission will start again.

264
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,260
9B, stand up.

265
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,200
8C, don't stand up. 8B, sit down.

266
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,960
10C, stand up.

267
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,360
9B, sit down.

268
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,660
10B and 10C, stand up together.

269
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,400
The one behind 10B, stand up.

270
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,730
(The one behind 10B, stand up.)

271
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,360
(Jong Kook is behind 10B.)

272
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,100
(Is that me?)

273
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,560
9B has failed the mission.

274
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,200
Why did he fail?

275
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,760
She said that the one behind 10B should stand up.

276
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,200
- I'm done? - He's dressed up and everything.

277
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,800
Wait, you're 10B?

278
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,500
(You're not quick-witted, Jong Kook.)

279
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,630
The members of Running Man have failed the quick-witted mission.

280
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,230
(Quick-witted carriage mission failed.)

281
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,500
Jong Kook messed it all up.

282
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,900
He's usually good at games.

283
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,960
You will move on to the next carriage...

284
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,830
and perform a new mission.

285
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,460
- Are we going forward? - As I said,

286
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,060
all members must complete the mission in order to escape.

287
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,200
(This is not looking good.)

288
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
(Quick-witted carriage)

289
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,260
(Bedazzling carriage)

290
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,130
- Let's move to the next carriage. - Let's go.

291
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,360
- Good job, everyone. - Good job, everyone.

292
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,500
Where should we go?

293
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,200
What's this?

294
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,760
(They get strapped something on their waists.)

295
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
What is this?

296
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,360
It's some kind of a pouch.

297
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,060
This is a popular look these days.

298
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,300
(What is this bag?)

299
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,860
Something's in here.

300
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,900
- Is it food? - What is this?

301
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,330
Can I open it?

302
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,930
(Can I open it?)

303
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Oh, it's food.

304
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,200
(Things must be rough from here if they're already giving you food.)

305
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,800
(Whatever. Let's just eat.)

306
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,760
It's an announcement.

307
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,330
This is the bedazzling carriage.

308
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,500
All of you must enjoy the next train and pass without reaching "baek".

309
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,500
- She told us to pass. - What did she say?

310
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,400
She told us to pass without reaching "baek".

311
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,330
- She must be referring to our bags. - Which "baek" is she talking about?

312
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,830
Should we leave our bags and pass?

313
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,160
- What does she mean by "baek"? - Maybe it's the number 100?

314
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,500
- Really? - It sounds possible too.

315
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,530
I don't think we should say the word "baek".

316
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,600
(What's the meaning of this "baek"?)

317
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,660
(They enter the second carriage.)

318
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,600
- What is this? - My goodness.

319
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,960
(Who set up a ballroom inside the train?)

320
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,230
- What is this? - My goodness.

321
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,530
- There are some female passengers. - They are all beautiful.

322
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,730
I guess they're not prisoners.

323
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,160
Do I know her?

324
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,460
(One woman has brought all of these women here.)

325
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,260
(Is she the leader?)

326
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,700
(She's the dancing queen, Hyo Lyn!)

327
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,130
(Why is she here?)

328
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:13,400
(She showed how good she was at dancing this July with Gary.)

329
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,830
(So why is she here?)

330
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,930
(The music begins without any notice.)

331
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,000
(All the passengers begin dancing.)

332
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,430
(The women force the prisoners to dance.)

333
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,130
(They all begin dancing, too.)

334
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,300
What's going on?

335
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,800
What's going on?

336
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,600
(Hyo Lyn stands up.)

337
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,900
(Here comes Hyo Lyn, everyone.)

338
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,030
Oh, Hyo Lyn. It's you.

339
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,430
- It's Hyo Lyn. - Hyo Lyn.

340
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,430
- What are they doing? - It's Hyo Lyn.

341
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,860
Gary.

342
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,130
- Hyo Lyn is here. - Where?

343
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,230
(Gary is really surprised to see Hyo Lyn here.)

344
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,500
(Gary and Hyo Lyn finally meet each other again.)

345
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,160
What's going on?

346
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,660
(All the passengers just keep dancing.)

347
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,230
(Let's dance together with them.)

348
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,900
(How have you been, Hyo Lyn?)

349
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,430
Hey, Hyo Lyn.

350
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,930
It seems that you became better at dancing.

351
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,530
You're better than before.

352
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,100
What's going on anyway?

353
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,360
What do we need to do?

354
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,660
(Do you want to know what this is?)

355
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,200
(You know it already.)

356
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,800
(So what does "baek" mean?)

357
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,560
Oh, I don't care any more.

358
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,960
Oh my gosh.

359
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,030
(Gary is absorbed in dancing.)

360
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,530
- Gary enjoyed it so much. - What's going on?

361
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,700
- Oh my gosh. - What was it about?

362
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,130
Who are these people anyway?

363
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,830
Hyo Lyn, do you know what's going on?

364
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,260
(I know. That was ridiculous.)

365
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,200
- Lee Seul. What are you doing? - Lee Seul.

366
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,160
- What are you doing? - How can you treat us like this?

367
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,700
- What's going on? - Lee Seul.

368
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,260
Lee Seul, is there something in our bags?

369
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,860
There must be.

370
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,100
What? What is it?

371
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,560
(What was inside our bags?)

372
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,260
(It's a pedometer.)

373
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,530
There was a pedometer.

374
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,260
(Why did you put it in?)

375
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,330
What's my number?

376
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,730
Is it 172?

377
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,100
Who scored 172?

378
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,930
I did.

379
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,200
This is a bedazzling carriage.

380
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,460
You could've escaped if none of you were bedazzled.

381
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,560
You've failed the mission.

382
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,900
You've failed the mission.

383
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,660
What did you do?

384
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,130
- You scored so high. - So it was the number 100.

385
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,730
Was that the reason why you told me to dance really hard?

386
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,560
- How could you do that? - She did?

387
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,500
Yes, she did.

388
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,700
- You must keep moving. - Really?

389
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,200
She says we need to move a lot.

390
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,260
(Don't score over 100 in your pedometer.)

391
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,800
Wait. Show me everyone's scores.

392
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,300
Kwang Soo, you scored 161.

393
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,500
Your scores must be high. You were close to Hyo Lyn.

394
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,000
Our scores are high because she told us to dance hard.

395
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,200
(Gary scored 180.)

396
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,630
Gary, your score is 180.

397
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,560
Well, I'm glad it's below 200.

398
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,430
- Total? - Yes, I didn't dance a lot.

399
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,930
Jong Kook danced only with his hands.

400
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,760
His score is too low.

401
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,100
I could feel the pedometer inside my bag.

402
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,330
(Although Jong Kook scored really low, they failed their mission.)

403
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,430
(Only Jong Kook and Ji Hyo scored less than 100.)

404
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,000
Gosh. It was close.

405
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,760
All of you scored over 100 except Ji Hyo and Jong Kook.

406
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,200
- Jong Kook's score is way too low. - What's wrong with it?

407
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,800
Even if I lie down and sleep, I can easily score more than that.

408
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,230
- How did you do it? - I had a strange feeling...

409
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,730
I had a strange feeling about the mission.

410
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,160
I can score more than 10 during my sleep.

411
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,000
Four is seriously too low. It really is.

412
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,400
Please take a sit and wait for the next instruction.

413
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,060
Can I talk to them while we wait?

414
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,200
What's your job?

415
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,470
We're Sistar's backup dancers.

416
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,100
(No wonder you were good at dancing.)

417
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,970
- You are dancers. - No wonder.

418
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,400
That was why...

419
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,100
they kept complaining about the music.

420
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,560
They said that the music was bad so it was hard to dance.

421
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,360
Are you here for the mission?

422
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,330
- Are you going to prison with us? - No.

423
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,830
- So are you getting off the train? - Yes.

424
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,030
- At this station? - Yes.

425
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,970
- Let's go together with us. - You leave after bedazzling us?

426
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,660
You and Gary should stay together for some time.

427
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,360
(Just wear these pants first. We'll talk after that.)

428
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,430
She made us dance.

429
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,030
- Wear these, Hyo Lyn. - That's okay.

430
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,200
Those are my pants, but I haven't worn them yet.

431
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,430
Wear those pants and stay with us.

432
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:36,700
We have two couples. You and Gary, and Jong Kook and Soo Ae.

433
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,560
- What do you mean? - You know what I mean.

434
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,800
Is Soo Ae here, too?

435
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,660
She might be waiting for us.

436
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,130
(Hyo Lyn and her backup dancers leave the train.)

437
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,860
- Bye, Hyo Lyn. - Bye.

438
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,900
- See you. - Bye, Hyo Lyn.

439
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,970
(I wish your successful escape.)

440
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,500
(They're getting near the prison every second.)

441
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,400
We were too excited.

442
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,000
It's good to enjoy what you got, but you should think beforehand.

443
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,260
We failed our first mission because of you.

444
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,630
(Don't you remember?)

445
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,800
Come on, everyone, we can do it.

446
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,760
(We've failed 2 times already.)

447
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,470
Next stop is the labouring platform.

448
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,970
(Labouring platform?)

449
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,700
The train will stop at the labouring platform shortly.

450
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:24,200
Running Man members, please get off the train and follow instructions.

451
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,970
- All right. Let's escape. - Let's escape.

452
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,470
- Let's go. - Yes. Let's go.

453
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,730
(Will they be able to escape the train at this stop?)

454
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,970
This stop is the labouring platform.

455
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,860
Everyone, get off the train immediately.

456
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,730
- The platform looks really nice. - You know where to sit, right?

457
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,560
- Yes. - Show your respect to the guards.

458
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,300
Nice to see you all.

459
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,400
Nice to see you all.

460
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,530
- Get out of the train. Quickly. - Hurry up.

461
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,660
(They talk really rude.)

462
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,800
- Get out of the train. Quickly. - Hurry up.

463
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,160
- Who are they? - Please take your seat.

464
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,760
- What? - Why are they here?

465
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,030
(GOT7 are the prison guards.)

466
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,760
(They are sharp and keen. They will be excellent warders.)

467
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,130
(You can't escape. Only work will bring you freedom.)

468
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,830
- Hurry up and get out. - When did you come here?

469
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,230
Please take a seat.

470
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,230
(Hurry up and sit down.)

471
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,130
- Hello. - Where should we sit?

472
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,800
Everyone, sit.

473
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,130
Get ready to work, everyone.

474
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,530
(Jong Kook seems uncomfortable.)

475
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,600
(What labouring will they do?)

476
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,260
You can leave if you finish stamping all of these.

477
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,730
You have to stamp 10,000 envelopes in a given time.

478
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,100
You have 20 minutes.

479
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,260
- 10,000 envelopes? - Get ready...

480
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,260
(We have to stamp 10,000 envelopes in 20 minutes?)

481
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,530
- That's a lot. - Start.

482
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,000
- Please stamp the other side. - Where should I stamp?

483
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,400
- Stamp the other side of envelope. - Stamp them prettily.

484
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,160
10,000 envelopes? Really?

485
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,700
My goodness.

486
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,030
- Stamp correctly. - We need to stamp 10,000 of these.

487
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,360
(Each member has to stamp about 1,500 envelopes to pass.)

488
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,000
It's a lot, but we can do it.

489
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,600
Jae Seok. Stamp like this.

490
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,330
Flip your envelopes like this.

491
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,160
It's much easier to do it this way.

492
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,400
- It's much faster this way. - How many minutes do we have?

493
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,860
You have 10,000 envelopes to stamp in total.

494
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,630
- Hey, Jae Seok. - We're doing great.

495
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,400
Jae Seok! Do it like this.

496
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,970
(Kwang Soo finds another trick.)

497
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,160
Do it like this.

498
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,000
- No cheating. - I'm not.

499
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,800
No cheating.

500
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,970
(What did I do wrong?)

501
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,860
- No cheating, please. - Don't use any tricks.

502
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,160
Stamp each envelope carefully. Check the ink each time.

503
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,630
This is a technique. It has nothing to do with cheating.

504
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,730
No cheating.

505
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,970
(Running Man prisoners are getting better at this labour.)

506
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,470
This is really hard.

507
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,560
(They have a lot more.)

508
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,700
(Look at Jong Kook.)

509
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,360
(He's working really quietly.)

510
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,030
Kwang Soo's method is the fastest.

511
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,230
Please sit down.

512
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,800
(We are watching you.)

513
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,400
We have 10,000 envelopes. So we have to stamp more than 1,000 each.

514
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,760
Shut your mouth!

515
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,060
What did you just say?

516
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,700
Seok Jin's angry.

517
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,030
- What did you just say? - Have manners!

518
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,260
Hey, Jackson.

519
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,430
(He's so into his role.)

520
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,830
- How can we stamp 10,000 of these? - Can I put these on the floor?

521
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,830
- Please sit. - How can we stamp 10,000...

522
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,400
(He looks shocked.)

523
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,960
We still have a long way to go.

524
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,830
(What did he see?)

525
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,860
You must sit.

526
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,160
7B, sit down.

527
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,430
(No matter what happens around him, Jong Kook is really consistent.)

528
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,700
(Seok Jin looks around.)

529
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,060
No cheating. Keep working.

530
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,760
- Don't put it in your pocket. - Why would you take it anyway?

531
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,230
My goodness.

532
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,430
(He pretends as if nothing happened.)

533
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,630
Kwang Soo's method works the best.

534
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,660
Something's written on this envelope.

535
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,160
(Did you find it too?)

536
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,130
(Staring)

537
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,660
(What have they found?)

538
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,560
(Kwang Soo also puts the envelope in his pocket.)

539
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,160
- All right. - Okay.

540
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,060
- Jee Seok Jin. - Thank you.

541
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,700
This is really hard.

542
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,530
(Security guards are everywhere.)

543
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,000
(What's the scheme?)

544
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,460
Please stamp them and keep things organised.

545
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,860
Guard? I'm so exhausted.

546
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,630
- Please hurry up. - It's really hard.

547
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,630
Prisoners are talking too much. Do the work.

548
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,700
(What did these two see?)

549
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,830
(A mysterious message is written on the envelope.)

550
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,830
(If name tag is torn while fleeing, you fail or are out for a minute.)

551
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,460
(Somewhere near R1 Station is a car to use for fleeing.)

552
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,460
This is too much.

553
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,730
- Sir, it's really hard. - Prisoners are talking too much.

554
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,400
(Jong Kook still hasn't found the hint.)

555
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,900
- The weather's too hot today. - Three minutes passed.

556
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,160
Stamping 10,000 envelopes is hard no matter how quickly you do it.

557
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,830
How can we stamp 10,000 envelopes?

558
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,230
Let's try it.

559
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,930
- Let's do it. - You can do it.

560
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:32,960
(Kwang Soo only pretends.)

561
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,500
Do it one by one like this.

562
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,360
Hurry up, hurry up.

563
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,930
Come on.

564
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,130
You need to start wrapping up now.

565
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,300
You have to finish up.

566
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,330
Okay.

567
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,760
(He's stuffing something in.)

568
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,600
- Seriously, it's too difficult. - Why this is...

569
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,160
- Haha is really fast. - Come on, guys.

570
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,100
- Do it faster. - Jong Kook seems angry.

571
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,960
- He seems angry, indeed. - This is difficult.

572
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,900
(Kwang Soo stands up while looking around carefully.)

573
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,400
Come on, people.

574
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,460
(He sneaks out towards the back.)

575
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,560
Goodness.

576
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,230
What's going on?

577
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,430
(Kwang Soo is running away.)

578
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,630
- What's going on? - What happened?

579
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,200
Take everything with you.

580
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,930
(Seok Jin looks around.)

581
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,330
(Seok Jin escapes as well.)

582
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,130
- Take everything with you. - Take everything.

583
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,730
(They run quickly.)

584
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:22,760
(The rest are in daze.)

585
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,060
Move out!

586
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,360
(Will he be caught or not?)

587
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,330
- Let's continue stamping. - What are you looking at?

588
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,260
(The guards surround the remaining prisoners.)

589
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,530
Work harder.

590
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,260
(Kwang Soo runs away at an amazing speed.)

591
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:38,430
(Jin Young catches onto him.)

592
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,130
(It's a major chase.)

593
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,200
No!

594
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,030
(If prisoners lose their name tags, they're sent to a solitary cell.)

595
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,500
(When guards lose their name tags, they get suspended for 1 minute.)

596
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:50,800
I almost got him.

597
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,630
- Guys, stay focused. - Come on and stay focused.

598
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,760
(Prisoners continue to stamp.)

599
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,160
(The chase continues.)

600
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,730
(Seok Jin runs for his freedom.)

601
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,860
(Will he be arrested like this?)

602
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,630
(He slips away.)

603
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,160
(His name tag is ripped.)

604
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,060
(Seok Jin fails to escape.)

605
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,830
(The guards are close to cornering Kwang Soo.)

606
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,160
(Why is he running in the opposite direction?)

607
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
Why is Kwang Soo suddenly trying to run away?

608
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,330
Seok Jin went somewhere, too.

609
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,000
Where did he go?

610
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,730
(I'm here.)

611
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,400
We should just work hard for now.

612
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,330
There must be something, but I have no idea.

613
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,600
(He was free for less than 30 seconds.)

614
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,800
This is a real solitary cell.

615
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:46,630
Oh my gosh, this is so real. Is this a toilet?

616
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,360
It is a solitary cell, indeed.

617
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,630
Oh my goodness, the toilet is here.

618
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,700
It's a real solitary cell.

619
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,730
(He is pathetic.)

620
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,160
It's a real solitary cell.

621
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,100
- Are you tired? - I'm so exhausted.

622
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,730
Jackson, I'm being serious.

623
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,930
Look how much I've done.

624
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,260
(He gives him more envelopes.)

625
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,900
(Guard Jackson has no mercy at all.)

626
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,360
Goodness, I'm about to lose my mind.

627
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,300
- What's wrong? - Where did Kwang Soo go?

628
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,930
(Here he comes.)

629
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:27,200
(Runaway Kwang Soo is everywhere.)

630
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,100
- Wait! - What?

631
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,760
(GOT7 guards are right after him.)

632
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,800
He's too tall.

633
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,230
(JB, Jin Young and Mark are on Kwang Soo now.)

634
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,660
(Will Kwang Soo be arrested?)

635
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,500
(He rips Mark's name tag.)

636
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,160
(Mark has to freeze for 1 minute.)

637
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,530
(Kwang Soo is resisting so fiercely.)

638
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,000
(I will escape.)

639
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,730
- How many have you done so far? - I don't know.

640
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,030
You're not counting, are you?

641
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,500
- Why aren't you? - How can I?

642
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,060
Why did they run away instead of finishing these off?

643
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,300
We have to stamp 10,000 envelopes.

644
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,460
They should've stayed and finished these together.

645
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,960
It's like watching a video.

646
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,830
You should say "VOD", not "video". It's more trending.

647
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,600
Stop pretending as if you know all new things.

648
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,260
Goodness, I can picture it. It's like I'm watching them on VOD.

649
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,830
Please do not argue.

650
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,560
We're not arguing. We were just having a conversation.

651
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,930
How many minutes do we have left?

652
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,860
You have a few minutes left.

653
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,660
(He presses firmly.)

654
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,030
Let's not press too hard.

655
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,260
How can I not?

656
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,100
- He tells us not to do anything. - How can I stamp then?

657
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,630
(My eyes are on you!)

658
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,860
(Kwang Soo is still resisting.)

659
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,530
Wait a minute.

660
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:54,030
(He rips JB's name tag.)

661
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:58,330
(JB gets suspended for 1 minute as well.)

662
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,930
Come here!

663
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,660
(Bambam comes to help.)

664
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,900
We can't stamp all 10,000 envelopes.

665
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,430
It's just my personal goal.

666
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,130
Are you okay? Isn't it too hot?

667
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,960
(Haha also finds the hint for escaping.)

668
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,830
(Kwang Soo stands face-to-face with Jin Young.)

669
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,360
(One who's trying to stop the other versus one who wants to escape)

670
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,600
(I will catch you.)

671
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,800
(No way.)

672
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,930
(It's a fierce battle.)

673
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,330
(Kwang Soo increases his chance to escape if he tackles Jin Young.)

674
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,100
(I'll definitely escape.)

675
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,460
(Jin Young rips his name tag.)

676
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,500
(Kwang Soo gets arrested.)

677
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,300
(I was so close to escaping.)

678
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,260
(He arrests Kwang Soo with his strong will.)

679
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,800
I wouldn't have tried to escape if I knew I was going to be arrested.

680
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,230
Why did I even try?

681
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,860
(Kwang Soo fails to escape.)

682
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,360
Why are all GOT7's members so good?

683
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,100
It's because we're younger.

684
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,630
Be quiet!

685
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,960
I'm the youngest member on Running Man!

686
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,660
(The youngest Running Man member fails to escape.)

687
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,460
(Excuse me.)

688
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,700
This place is already full.

689
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,960
Is there an air conditioner?

690
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,730
You have to be careful or else, you might press the wrong button.

691
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,330
Please excuse me.

692
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,630
I knew you'd get caught.

693
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:29,430
(Why are only the weak members in this solitary cell?)

694
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,530
(Only 5 minutes remain.)

695
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,300
(Ji Hyo also finds the hint about how to escape.)

696
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,730
(She shares the hint with Gary.)

697
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,160
(The nice guard hasn't noticed it.)

698
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,930
(Whispering)

699
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,400
- Hey, you can't do that here. - What?

700
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,860
- What's going on? - No dating is allowed.

701
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,230
(Jae Seok also finds the hint.)

702
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,200
I stamped so many envelopes.

703
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,900
It's impossible to stamp 10,000 envelopes.

704
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,700
(He looks around.)

705
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,960
- Don't look to your side. - What?

706
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,100
- Do not look. - How can I...

707
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,660
only look at the envelopes?

708
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,700
Don't give each other looks.

709
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,300
You have four minutes left.

710
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:16,060
- We only have four minutes? - You have four minutes left.

711
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,900
How many envelopes have I stamped?

712
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,300
It's nothing.

713
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,160
(Suddenly)

714
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,330
(Ji Hyo and Gary attempt to escape at the same time.)

715
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,300
Ji Hyo!

716
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,900
What's going on?

717
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,700
(He looks around carefully.)

718
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,860
(This is my chance!)

719
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,700
What is everyone doing?

720
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,360
(Jong Kook is the only one who didn't get the hint.)

721
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:44,800
(They desperately want to escape.)

722
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,130
She's good at running.

723
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,230
(He runs for his freedom.)

724
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,400
She's good at running.

725
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,560
(Gary fails to escape.)

726
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,530
Goodness.

727
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,100
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo runs upstairs.)

728
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,460
(On the other hand, Jae Seok...)

729
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,260
(is fighting against two guards and Gary.)

730
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,000
Grab him! I won't let anyone escape if I can't.

731
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,400
(Bambam gets suspended for 1 minute.)

732
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,760
(Ripping)

733
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,060
(Jin Young also gets suspended for 1 minute.)

734
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,560
What's going on with everyone?

735
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,660
(Haha also attempts to escape.)

736
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,560
(Jae Seok also runs upstairs.)

737
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,760
(He'll succeed once he gets through Yu Gyeom.)

738
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,900
If everyone works hard, they'll be able to escape.

739
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,200
(He has the mind of an ideal prisoner.)

740
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,960
You said you won't run away!

741
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,830
(Yu Gyeom is fighting against 2 prisoners.)

742
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,430
Everyone's out, Yu Gyeom.

743
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,030
(Once they get through this door,)

744
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,600
(they'll finally see the runaway vehicle.)

745
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,630
Where is it? Be careful.

746
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,760
(Yu Gyeom tackles Ji Hyo.)

747
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,930
Ji Hyo!

748
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,530
(I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.)

749
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,900
Let me go.

750
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:55,060
Jae Seok has already left, so I have no choice.

751
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,300
- I have no choice. - No.

752
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,530
He escaped.

753
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,700
(Ji Hyo fails to escape.)

754
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,160
(Jae Seok, please escape.)

755
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,830
(Will Jae Seok successfully escape?)

756
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,930
(Only 1 minute remain until Train to Prison departs.)

757
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,100
How can I open this?

758
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,830
(Open the door to freedom.)

759
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:20,460
(I must stop him.)

760
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,330
(He will escape from this prison once he runs down the stairs.)

761
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,230
(What?)

762
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,100
Goodness.

763
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,400
(Bambam stops Jae Seok from escaping.)

764
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,860
(I was so close to escaping.)

765
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,500
- I was caught near the parking lot. - Really?

766
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,530
- Where is Haha? - Where did he go?

767
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,030
- What? - Did he leave?

768
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,300
(They can't find Haha anywhere on the train.)

769
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,330
Where is Haha?

770
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:52,300
I saw him going somewhere by himself...

771
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,800
when others were not looking at him.

772
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,900
Wait.

773
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,030
Haha succeeded in escaping at the labouring platform.

774
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,200
So he did escape.

775
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,100
(How did Haha escape?)

776
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,160
(No one was interested in this runaway vehicle.)

777
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,330
(It's Haha!)

778
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,500
(He gets on the runaway vehicle, panting.)

779
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,060
Finally, I made it.

780
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,530
I escaped!

781
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,600
(Haha made it out of the prison.)

782
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,230
Let's go have lunch.

783
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:33,030
(They feel dejected.)

784
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,700
If it were the movie, "Train to Busan",

785
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,400
he should be the one to play Ma Dong Seok's part.

786
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,500
- That's true. - Imagine Ma Dong Seok...

787
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,230
just sitting there, stamping the envelopes.

788
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,530
You should have taken the lead.

789
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,360
- Exactly. - You should've fought them.

790
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,060
- Then we could've escaped. - He's not doing his part.

791
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,230
We can just stamp 10,000 envelopes and escape.

792
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,500
- My goodness. - You're wrong.

793
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,260
That's not the point of the mission.

794
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,730
Why do I have to do that?

795
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,900
- I don't think it's that difficult. - My goodness.

796
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,230
Then, each of us should stamp 1,500 envelops.

797
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,500
Listen to me.

798
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,500
I am the Gong Yoo here.

799
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,700
- What did you say? - Oh, my.

800
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,860
- Say that again. - You're the zombie number 103.

801
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,900
- Gary! - You're crude oil.

802
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:10,000
(You're crude oil, not Gong Yoo.)

803
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Crude oil? Gosh.

804
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,260
Jong Kook. You should lead us like Ma Dong Seok.

805
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,430
- The thing is... - He wants to stamp the envelopes.

806
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,230
If we had shared the information,

807
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,660
we could've just taken off their name tags.

808
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:24,160
But I knew nothing. If I knew, I would have done that.

809
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,370
(It's a relief that Jong Kook didn't get the clue.)

810
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,200
That's what you should've done.

811
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,370
I could've removed their name tags if I had the clue...

812
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,230
just like the movie!

813
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:38,960
(Haha is the only one who made his way out of the train.)

814
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,500
Here.

815
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,370
This is for Jong Kook.

816
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,060
(Lunch outside the train is good.)

817
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,800
Can you reach Haha?

818
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,760
- It's useless. - What's the point of calling him?

819
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,160
Gosh, it's meaningless.

820
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:01,000
It's not like I said something outrageous.

821
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,870
How can you say such ridiculous thing?

822
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,260
It was just an opinion.

823
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,500
- In prison? - He said it's ridiculous.

824
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,530
- We're in prison now. - Was it that wrong?

825
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,960
Please don't forget that this is prison.

826
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,460
I just wanted to know how Haha was doing outside.

827
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,000
How can you say, "ridiculous"?

828
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,130
How many missions are there that we can escape alone?

829
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,200
- Please stop. - Why do you ask that?

830
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,960
We should all escape together.

831
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,100
Let's carry out the existing missions first.

832
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,600
- Don't try to escape alone. - Sir, as I said earlier,

833
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,730
if you played your part, at least one of us would be out there by now.

834
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,500
You were just sitting there saying it's too hot.

835
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,700
If we keep losing our members like that,

836
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,530
- it'll disadvantage us... - Wait, let me tell you this.

837
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,000
You must not be lazy in order to escape from here.

838
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,630
- In "The Shawshank Redemption"... - You should just rot in here.

839
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,630
Let me speak. If we stick together like now,

840
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:49,030
I'm sure they'll give us a mission which is easier when we're together.

841
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:52,900
No way. The fewer members there are,

842
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,800
- higher the possibility of escape. - You don't know what we'll do next.

843
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,630
If you'll keep fighting, get off now.

844
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,900
- You two are too loud. - What's wrong with you?

845
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,870
We all ended up in here because we committed crimes.

846
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:02,870
- What's your accusation? - Crime?

847
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:03,870
- What? - Gosh.

848
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,630
I want to commit a serious crime in this carriage now.

849
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,600
(How scary.)

850
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,800
Goodness.

851
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,530
(They're getting closer to the prison while squabbling.)

852
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,630
Are we already there?

853
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,760
The mission you'll do now is "Until the End".

854
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
What is it?

855
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,230
("Until the End"?)

856
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,960
You'll take turns to complete the mission.

857
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,060
(The members will take turns to complete the mission.)

858
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,370
- Is it my turn? - Go for it.

859
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,500
- Gary. - Gary, you can do it.

860
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,900
- Okay. - Way to go!

861
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,760
- Go for it. - Let's go!

862
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,900
- Good luck. - Gary is on his way.

863
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,600
(Gary, show us what you got!)

864
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,260
If Gary succeeds...

865
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,530
- My goodness! - Gosh.

866
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,400
- What is it? - What happened?

867
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,030
That's too hard.

868
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,870
(What is that behind him?)

869
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:58,800
(Red strings with bells attached)

870
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,760
(The 4th mission of Train to Prison, "Until the End")

871
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,870
(They must pass the carriage without ringing the bells.)

872
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,000
(If they make the bells ring twice, they fail.)

873
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,130
- My goodness! - Gosh.

874
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,000
- What is it? - What happened?

875
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,760
- That's too difficult. - I don't think he can pull it off.

876
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,330
- We can't even cheat in there. - Are those strings?

877
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,330
(Gary starts the mission.)

878
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,160
Shall I begin now?

879
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,700
I think...

880
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,400
each of us will take five minutes in this round.

881
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,700
(He carefully moves his leg.)

882
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,530
(Goodness!)

883
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,800
(What a tense moment.)

884
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,700
(Ringing)

885
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,600
(Gary gets the first warning.)

886
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,960
(I only have one chance left.)

887
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,660
(He's extra cautious.)

888
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,530
You have to really focus to do this.

889
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,230
(How thrilling!)

890
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,060
(Will he be able to succeed?)

891
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:07,260
(Jong Kook, the second player, starts the mission.)

892
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,870
Can I start now?

893
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,100
(He's taking bold steps.)

894
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:17,630
(He enters the first difficult course where Gary rang a bell.)

895
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,370
I just shouldn't ring the bell, right?

896
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:27,060
(He gets through the first course.)

897
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:31,060
(In the second difficult course, he must crawl.)

898
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:34,400
(He chooses to lie down in this course.)

899
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,760
(He uses everything he can and moves at a fast pace.)

900
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,100
Goodness.

901
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,030
It's harder for me since I'm bigger than others.

902
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,900
(His muscles are the problem.)

903
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,370
He's taking a long time.

904
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,370
Gosh, he's so bulky.

905
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,630
He's too gigantic.

906
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,030
That's why he's taking so long.

907
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,430
He should have stopped working out.

908
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,660
(What is he doing?)

909
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,260
- Are you stretching your body? - Yes.

910
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,300
Why are you stretching so shyly?

911
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,000
Are you a chicken?

912
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,660
Are you pecking at crumbs?

913
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,100
- Goodness. - You look like a chicken.

914
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,200
This really helps stretch my body. It feels good.

915
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,960
You look like you're pecking at feed.

916
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,400
- Is it good? - Yes.

917
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,160
(Seok Jin follows Jae Seok right away.)

918
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,960
- That is... - My goodness.

919
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,400
I learnt this posture from my yoga teacher.

920
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,430
Put your legs together and...

921
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,630
(We're looking for his yoga teacher.)

922
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:34,100
- lower your upper body like this. - What is that?

923
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,260
(Jong Kook is undergoing the hardest course like a chicken as well.)

924
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:49,500
(He hasn't rung any bells so far.)

925
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,870
(He's doing fairly well despite his bulky body.)

926
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,700
(I'm almost done.)

927
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,500
(He even passes through the most difficult course.)

928
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,870
(Jong Kook clears the mission.)

929
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:13,870
Am I done?

930
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,200
- You succeeded. - Okay.

931
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:21,800
We will give you a clue that will be of big help...

932
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,030
in the final mission.

933
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,870
- This one? - That's a remote control.

934
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:33,660
- The final mission? - It'll help you escape together.

935
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,870
(The remote is the clue to escaping together.)

936
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:39,400
(The final destination of this train is prison.)

937
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,060
(There are numerous surveillance cameras all around the prison.)

938
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,200
(There's only one way not to get caught on camera!)

939
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,960
(In order for all of them to escape, they need this remote control!)

940
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:55,400
Or you can choose this Escaping Chance...

941
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,000
which allows you to get off at the next station.

942
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,600
(We will give you this Escaping Chance.)

943
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,800
- To me? - Pick one.

944
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:09,130
(Between the remote and Escaping Chance, which one will he choose?)

945
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:12,400
Goodness. I don't know what to do.

946
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,600
(Hesitating)

947
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,200
I think he pulled it off.

948
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:22,200
Prisoner Kim Jong Kook succeeded in the mission "Until the End".

949
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,730
- He made it. - That's amazing.

950
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:27,660
- Maybe it's not impossible. - Gary also made it really quickly.

951
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,300
It's possible.

952
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,400
(Did Gary also make it?)

953
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,370
Gary succeeded in the mission "Until the End".

954
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,370
Okay!

955
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,530
(He also succeeded.)

956
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,060
(And...)

957
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,060
Can I get out of this carriage now?

958
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:45,600
(It's time to make a choice.)

959
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,000
Goodness!

960
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,370
This is too hard!

961
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,930
(Escaping Chance)

962
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,370
- Can I escape right away with this? - Yes.

963
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:58,900
(Why is this happening to me?)

964
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:03,430
(Which one will they choose?)

965
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,130
- Ji Hyo, go for it. - Good luck.

966
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,600
- See you soon. - Ji Hyo, do it quickly.

967
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,870
- I'll try my best. - Ji Hyo, you can do it.

968
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,500
(My goodness.)

969
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,660
(Will stiff Ji Hyo be able to make it?)

970
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,870
I think it'll hurt my body.

971
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,870
(She enters the first difficult course.)

972
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,230
(She passed the first course.)

973
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:36,400
(Another hard course follows, where she has to crawl.)

974
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,400
(Ringing)

975
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,600
(The first warning)

976
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,700
Gosh.

977
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,900
(Let's calm down.)

978
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,200
(Ringing)

979
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:54,030
(She's flustered.)

980
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,930
It wasn't me.

981
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,260
The bell jingled because the train rattled.

982
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,660
(Ding-dong)

983
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:05,370
Prisoner Song Ji Hyo failed the "Until the End" mission.

984
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,830
Why did I fail?

985
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,260
Please let me try again.

986
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,830
(Ji Hyo fails the mission.)

987
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,100
(Now, it's Seok Jin's turn.)

988
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,460
Ouch.

989
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,600
It's not bad. It's better than I thought.

990
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,500
(It's better than he thought it would be.)

991
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,370
(Jingling)

992
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:35,730
Maybe I misjudged.

993
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:36,760
(He gets the first warning so quickly.)

994
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,900
(Jingling again)

995
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:43,930
What?

996
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:47,530
Prisoner Ji Seok Jin has failed the "Until the End" mission.

997
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,500
Did I fail?

998
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,300
(It's no surprise.)

999
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,830
Unbelievable.

1000
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:02,430
How could you fail the mission so quickly?

1001
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:05,430
(Now, it's Jae Seok's turn.)

1002
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,760
(It's the bell that made Seok Jin fail.)

1003
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,060
I should lower my body.

1004
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:11,900
You can lower your body like this.

1005
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,260
(He looks like he's doing a backstroke.)

1006
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,630
All right!

1007
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,300
(He heads towards the next course.)

1008
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,800
(It looks like a chicken is pecking.)

1009
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,700
(Jingling)

1010
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:29,860
(He receives his 1st warning.)

1011
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,260
I should've removed my name tag.

1012
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,200
(He is still pecking.)

1013
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,700
(After finishing the pecking course,)

1014
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,560
(he meets the crawling course where Ji Hyo failed.)

1015
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,760
(Jingling again)

1016
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,530
(Jae Seok fails too.)

1017
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,260
(Sighing)

1018
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,630
Please wait.

1019
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,460
If you give me one more chance, I can succeed.

1020
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,500
(There is no mercy.)

1021
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:02,260
Prisoner Yu Jae Seok has failed the "Until the End" mission.

1022
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:08,160
(It's Kwang Soo's turn now.)

1023
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:11,430
(His height will most definitely come to his disadvantage.)

1024
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,260
(He's going faster than expected.)

1025
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,260
How should I pass this course?

1026
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,160
Up or down?

1027
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,160
(It's the course where Ji Hyo and Jae Seok failed.)

1028
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,430
(Jingling)

1029
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,760
No, no, it's not.

1030
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,160
I didn't fail. No, I didn't.

1031
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,600
I was not even close to the bell.

1032
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,260
The bell rang over there.

1033
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:38,360
Wait a minute.

1034
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,060
Oh, it's maybe because I touched the seat.

1035
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:43,200
I didn't directly touch the bell so it should be okay, right?

1036
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,460
(He rolls up his pants and gets ready to start again.)

1037
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,060
(Jingling)

1038
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:02,360
Prisoner Lee Kwang Soo has failed the "Until the End" mission.

1039
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,600
What do you mean I failed?

1040
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,060
Why did I fail?

1041
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,260
(Didn't you hear the bell ringing?)

1042
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,330
The seat made the bells ring.

1043
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,760
I just shook the seat.

1044
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:14,500
I'm not someone who fails in missions like this.

1045
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,060
(The Unlucky Trio all failed the mission.)

1046
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,960
(Only Gary and Jong Kook passed the "Until the End" mission.)

1047
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,800
I still don't understand why I failed.

1048
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,600
(The 6 prisoners gather together again.)

1049
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,960
- I think I know. - Me neither.

1050
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,630
I almost passed.

1051
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:31,560
I almost passed it too.

1052
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:35,330
The four of you have failed the "Until the End" mission.

1053
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:37,100
Gosh.

1054
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:41,430
If you pass the mission, you are given some items.

1055
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,900
You could get an item that we can use...

1056
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,700
in a group mission later...

1057
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:50,230
or an escaping chance you can use right away.

1058
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:52,930
Between those two, we chose this one.

1059
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:56,330
(What did Gary and Jong Kook choose?)

1060
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,760
What was the mission this time?

1061
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:02,100
"Until the End" mission.

1062
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,160
"Until the End" mission?

1063
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,200
"Until the End"...

1064
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:11,430
Because it's "Until the End",

1065
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,960
I'll give this back to you.

1066
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,730
I have to take this, right?

1067
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,930
(Gary chose the item for the group mission.)

1068
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,360
I don't know what to do. If I choose this, can I go now?

1069
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:29,060
(Will he choose the item for the group mission?)

1070
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:32,200
I kept telling them that we should stick together until the end.

1071
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:39,530
I'll go with them until the end.

1072
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:42,360
(Jong Kook also chose the item for the group mission.)

1073
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,130
I won't surrender myself to temptation.

1074
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:48,160
("Train to Prison", they are loyal until the end.)

1075
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,930
(You must be impressed by our loyalty.)

1076
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,930
(Jong Kook, Gary...)

1077
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:59,160
- Why did you give up the chance? - Why?

1078
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,730
You should have picked it.

1079
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,300
If you can go, you should go.

1080
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,160
Before we started, we said we should stick together.

1081
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,400
- What are you talking about? - You should have left.

1082
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:10,830
You should have gone home and taken a rest.

1083
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:11,900
Gosh.

1084
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,400
I want to swear at them. What should I do?

1085
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:14,960
I really want to swear right now.

1086
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,500
How could you survive with that naive mind in a tough world?

1087
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:20,060
(They are at a loss.)

1088
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,700
(Did we choose loyalty just for those guys?)

1089
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,860
(1 hour before they arrive at the prison)

1090
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:31,460
Please be on standby until the next mission is given.

1091
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,230
(There are only two chances left to escape.)

1092
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:39,400
(It's getting more difficult to enjoy freedom.)

1093
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:44,600
(Now, they have to focus to avoid ending up in prison.)

1094
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,830
(Seok Jin is fast asleep.)

1095
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,060
(Smirking)

1096
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,200
(Let's prank Seok Jin.)

1097
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,700
Is that true?

1098
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,500
(He takes the bait.)

1099
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,730
- This? - What is it?

1100
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,060
- What shall we do? - It's unbelievable.

1101
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:07,760
- This is crazy. - It really is.

1102
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,560
(What? What is it?)

1103
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:12,100
(He is acting seriously.)

1104
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,860
What are you up to? You're teasing me, aren't you?

1105
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,730
(But then...)

1106
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,130
Seok Jin, just say you're sorry.

1107
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,630
(Is that a surprise mission?)

1108
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:28,100
(The first one to remove a name tag clears the mission.)

1109
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:33,830
(Right. We should never let our guards down.)

1110
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:40,060
(I'm laughing outside but not inside.)

1111
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,560
(Sorry, I'll take your name tag.)

1112
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,600
(He rips it off.)

1113
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:50,060
What? What are you doing?

1114
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,630
Kwang Soo, you cleared the mission. Please come forward.

1115
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,800
What's going on?

1116
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,960
(What mission did he clear?)

1117
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,130
What is this?

1118
00:49:58,660 --> 00:49:59,900
What...

1119
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,660
When did that mission appear?

1120
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,060
Kwang Soo that brat!

1121
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:05,300
Why?

1122
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,360
(You should have been attentive.)

1123
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:11,700
Is that the mission on the screen?

1124
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,060
Yes, it is.

1125
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,300
When did it appear?

1126
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,130
What? Is that a mission?

1127
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,130
Did you see that now?

1128
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:20,900
- I saw it just now. - When did you see it?

1129
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,400
I saw it as soon as your name tag was removed.

1130
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:24,030
I also saw that at that time.

1131
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:25,130
(Kwang Soo is incredible.)

1132
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:26,730
I'm really upset at him.

1133
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,730
(The temptation is given to the one who completes the mission.)

1134
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:32,430
You can choose the device...

1135
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,060
or the Escaping Chance.

1136
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,400
(It's an ordeal to choose between those two.)

1137
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,630
(What's going to be Kwang Soo's choice?)

1138
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:44,700
- It's just like you. - I won't forgive you.

1139
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:46,530
How could you...

1140
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:48,060
- Look at me. - How dare you?

1141
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:49,800
You are so mean.

1142
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:52,800
(Is he escaping just like that?)

1143
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,100
- He doesn't even look back. - He doesn't.

1144
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,500
See you tomorrow.

1145
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,460
- Are you going home? - Goodbye.

1146
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:05,300
You can choose between these two.

1147
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,230
I'll go home.

1148
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:11,830
Sure, I'll go home and I'll eat udon on the way.

1149
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:13,930
(He chose the Escaping Chance without hesitation.)

1150
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:15,800
- See you tomorrow. - Are you going home?

1151
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,060
Goodbye.

1152
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,960
(They're speechless.)

1153
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,330
That's what Kwang Soo is like.

1154
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,460
- Give him a good slap. - It's not the station yet.

1155
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,730
It's not the station yet.

1156
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:32,460
- We haven't arrived at the station. - I should go.

1157
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,500
Where do you think you can go?

1158
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,260
You can't go.

1159
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,400
They can't stop me from getting off.

1160
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,830
- You can't go. - You can't get off.

1161
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:43,300
They could have chosen the Escaping Chance too.

1162
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,160
I picked the Escaping Chance.

1163
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,160
So you already picked the Chance over there.

1164
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,430
You already did?

1165
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:50,930
Kwang Soo has chosen the Escaping Chance.

1166
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,160
(You didn't have to repeat that.)

1167
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,000
What about Gary and Jong Kook?

1168
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,130
They must feel so in vain.

1169
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:57,600
(Our loyalty became useless.)

1170
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,030
Kwang Soo will get off the train at the next station.

1171
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:01,760
(Kwang Soo the Betrayer can escape.)

1172
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,600
Members who failed the mission, move over to the next carriage.

1173
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,730
(It's 40 minutes before they arrive at the prison...)

1174
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:15,730
(and 10 seconds before Kwang Soo can escape.)

1175
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:19,100
Bye, everyone. See you tomorrow.

1176
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:20,660
- Just go. - Bye.

1177
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,060
He's so annoying.

1178
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:23,130
Bye.

1179
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,130
(Have a nice trip to the prison.)

1180
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:33,560
(Haha and Kwang Soo have escaped.)

1181
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:39,930
Am I going home in this uniform?

1182
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:42,160
(Yes, you should go in the uniform.)

1183
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,200
(Sighing)

1184
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:48,160
- A ticket to Seoul Station, please. - You should go to Yongsan.

1185
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,160
To Yongsan, please.

1186
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:54,400
(He doesn't have his manager or stylist with him.)

1187
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:01,830
(It'd be better to take this off.)

1188
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,730
(Maybe not?)

1189
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,700
(What's with that prisoner?)

1190
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,500
I'm no longer a prisoner.

1191
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:14,400
You must wear this to Seoul Station.

1192
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,500
Really? But this isn't a penalty.

1193
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,900
(I should've stayed in the Train to Prison.)

1194
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,700
It's okay when I'm with others but when I'm alone it's...

1195
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:23,930
(This is so embarrassing.)

1196
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,930
You keep making me wear these old clothes again.

1197
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,430
(I'm fine with the fresh air out here.)

1198
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,030
(What consoles me are boiled eggs and castella bread.)

1199
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:38,530
(They're the taste of freedom.)

1200
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:42,930
(There is one station left until prison.)

1201
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,760
- Go in, go in. - You go in first.

1202
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,030
(What is awaiting them?)

1203
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,800
There are gifts here.

1204
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:50,200
Can we have them?

1205
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:51,600
(Why are there gift boxes here?)

1206
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,900
Are you opening them for an Escaping Chance?

1207
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,360
I didn't open it.

1208
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,660
- This is the percentage carriage. - Okay.

1209
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:01,560
Running Man members, please carefully choose a box.

1210
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,830
- What? - Do we choose one?

1211
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,000
(What's the percentage carriage?)

1212
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:08,500
We just need to choose?

1213
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,000
(What trap is hidden inside the boxes?)

1214
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:14,060
30 percent of the boxes here are...

1215
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:17,730
R boxes. 70 percent of the boxes are unlucky boxes.

1216
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:22,100
(So are only 30 percent of these R boxes?)

1217
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,500
(The box selection that'll decide the final escape begins.)

1218
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,200
I shouldn't choose the big one.

1219
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,960
- This is driving me crazy. - Did you choose one?

1220
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,830
What happens if we choose the unlucky box?

1221
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,900
Then you will be at a disadvantage for this mission.

1222
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,730
- My goodness. - What should I choose?

1223
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:39,260
I'm so bad at these things.

1224
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:41,260
I have bad luck but will I have good luck today?

1225
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:42,800
Ji Hyo has good senses for this.

1226
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,560
- My gosh. - The members must take the box.

1227
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,630
Let's leave this up to luck.

1228
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,600
- Okay. - Leave it up to luck.

1229
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:50,900
I won't change my box.

1230
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,960
- This one. - Choose anything.

1231
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,130
- But this is... - It doesn't matter.

1232
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:55,960
- You can't help it. - Goodness.

1233
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,430
- It's a game of chance. - We choose without reason.

1234
00:54:58,430 --> 00:54:59,500
It's just...

1235
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,560
- Gosh, I don't know. - Goodness.

1236
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,060
- Hurry up. - Just choose one.

1237
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:05,700
- You chose the same one. - Gosh, here.

1238
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,760
I don't know any more.

1239
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,160
- What's the worst that can happen? - I'm not good at these things.

1240
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,930
- Me neither. - Neither am I.

1241
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,430
Please open each of your boxes.

1242
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:14,930
Oh, gosh.

1243
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,600
- Please. - This is probably an unlucky one.

1244
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,230
Let's start with Gary.

1245
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:25,630
(Will Gary get off or stay on the train?)

1246
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:26,660
It's "R"!

1247
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:29,130
(Gary chose the R box.)

1248
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,960
It's "R"!

1249
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:35,560
(The unlucky percentage has increased.)

1250
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,860
(The R box percentage decreased.)

1251
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,200
- Jae Seok. - O, P, Q, R!

1252
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:46,660
- O, P, Q, R. - R!

1253
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:49,330
- O, P, Q, R. - This is unbelievable.

1254
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,430
I'm really bad at this.

1255
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:55,600
(Will he expectedly have chosen the unlucky box?)

1256
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,230
O, P, Q, unlucky.

1257
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:03,930
(Jae Seok chose the unlucky box.)

1258
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:07,230
(He's a proven pure-blood, unlucky man.)

1259
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,300
How can this happen?

1260
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,830
(He's so unlucky.)

1261
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:15,460
- This isn't a fictional character. - Gosh.

1262
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:16,900
- It's not made up. - Really.

1263
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,430
- He has an unlucky hand. - I have no luck.

1264
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,330
- I've never chosen the right one. - He didn't even look.

1265
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,430
(It's Jong Kook's turn.)

1266
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:27,860
He's going to get an "R".

1267
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:34,730
(Will Jong Kook's Chuseok be a lucky one?)

1268
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:35,830
Open it at once.

1269
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,630
(Jong Kook chose an R box.)

1270
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,830
O, P, Q, R!

1271
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,060
(Mixed feelings of joy and disappointment)

1272
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:45,500
- "R". - It's an "R".

1273
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:48,030
- O, P, Q, R. - "R".

1274
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:50,330
- My gosh. - What's yours?

1275
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:51,700
- I think I have the unlucky box. - This...

1276
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,100
- Ji Hyo... - She'll get the R box.

1277
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,560
- Of course. - It's an "R".

1278
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,800
(Will lucky Ji Hyo be able to get off the train?)

1279
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,460
I got the unlucky box.

1280
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:06,130
- Really? - What?

1281
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,560
Ji Hyo usually doesn't choose the unlucky ones.

1282
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,760
Did she get the unlucky box?

1283
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,230
(Does this mean I have an R box?)

1284
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,130
- Does this mean that I have... - The unlucky box.

1285
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:16,130
No.

1286
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:21,400
(Will the oldest of the Unlucky Trio have chosen the R box?)

1287
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:27,600
O, P, Q, R.

1288
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,960
(It's a shocking betrayal of the Unlucky Trio.)

1289
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,960
- O, P, Q, R. - Is Seok Jin getting off now?

1290
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,030
This is a surprise.

1291
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,400
- Really? - O, P, Q...

1292
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,400
I've given you my unlucky hand.

1293
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,700
I have passed on my unlucky hand to you.

1294
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:42,160
(Ji Hyo and Jae Seok are headed for live broadcasting.)

1295
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:45,000
Eight minutes from now, we will arrive at...

1296
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,660
the final station of the prison battle.

1297
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:50,630
The three members who chose the R box can get off here...

1298
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:53,730
or stay to help the remaining members.

1299
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,730
What do we do when we get off?

1300
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:58,030
(Why must you test us?)

1301
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:02,260
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo are chosen for the penalty.)

1302
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:06,000
Is there a prize if we stay to the end?

1303
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,430
You can avoid the penalty.

1304
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:09,700
- Is that all? - But...

1305
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,500
there's no need for everyone to stay.

1306
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,530
Let's let Seok Jin leave.

1307
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:16,800
(Even if he stays, he won't be of help anyways.)

1308
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,300
- Why are you saying that? - For the last mission...

1309
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,560
(Please leave us and escape.)

1310
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,730
If this is our mission...

1311
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:25,730
- You're being harsh. - It's not that.

1312
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:27,730
I was going to leave anyway.

1313
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:30,230
You must decide now...

1314
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:34,230
so that you can do a mission to have everyone escape.

1315
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:37,960
Really? If we succeed in this mission, can we all escape?

1316
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,800
- Shouldn't we all escape together? - I will just leave.

1317
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,800
Okay.

1318
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:44,960
Seok Jin said he'll leave.

1319
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,360
- Did he say it? - He already told them.

1320
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:50,260
Gary.

1321
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,900
- If it's a mission for everyone... - I'll sit in the front.

1322
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,360
I won't look at them.

1323
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,100
Right. If we all succeed the mission together, can we all escape?

1324
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:02,260
Gary, this train has gone far already.

1325
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,430
I'll get off the train.

1326
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:06,000
It's the same if you go home from here or the last station.

1327
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,100
I'll get off.

1328
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,800
- Gary! - I have to avoid...

1329
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,800
- the live broadcast. - Gary.

1330
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,730
- If you help us, we can all not go. - Wow.

1331
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:16,500
I was going to stay but I can't after seeing Kwang Soo leave.

1332
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,330
- Gary. - It's hard not to leave.

1333
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,000
Is there an empty seat up there?

1334
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,060
- Over here. - Come here.

1335
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,760
- Why? - I'll move.

1336
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:25,830
(Where are you going?)

1337
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:28,000
- Ji Hyo, wait a minute. - Go ahead! Go.

1338
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:29,130
Don't do this.

1339
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:30,230
- Just go. - It's hard to sit next to them.

1340
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:31,800
My goodness.

1341
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,330
You two must do the live show together.

1342
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:35,460
(We'll cheer you guys on.)

1343
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,230
I'll cheer you on.

1344
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,260
You must do the mission now. We're running out of time.

1345
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:42,060
Go ahead. They'll do the mission.

1346
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,730
(The mission is passed onto the two unlucky members.)

1347
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,000
Okay, fine.

1348
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,300
- It's your final chance to escape. - All right.

1349
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:51,600
Ji Hyo.

1350
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:56,160
It's our last chance. It's really our final chance.

1351
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:00,160
(If we lose this final opportunity,)

1352
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:06,260
(the Train to Prison awaits us.)

1353
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,200
(5 minutes before arriving at Prison Station.)

1354
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:14,360
This is our final chance.

1355
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,500
Gosh, this is...

1356
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:18,460
(My goodness.)

1357
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:19,460
- What is it? - This is...

1358
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:20,960
Gosh, this is really...

1359
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,460
- What is it? - I guess you'll be escaping now.

1360
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:25,660
(What is the final mission that'll decide their destination?)

1361
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,300
It's okay. You'll make it.

1362
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,730
(It's the pirate roulette.)

1363
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,160
It's okay, Ji Hyo.

1364
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,900
Ji Hyo has good luck.

1365
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,730
I'll get caught for sure with this.

1366
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:37,160
- Let's go. - We'll take away two knives for...

1367
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,360
each member that chose the R box and decides to help.

1368
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:44,700
But since all the members who chose the R box decided to escape,

1369
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,930
- there will be 18 knives. - That's a problem.

1370
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:49,460
- How many holes are there? - There are 24.

1371
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:51,230
- You can do it. - If it pops, you fail.

1372
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:53,400
The final mission of the percentage carriage.

1373
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:58,130
Succeed in the pirate roulette with 18 knives and 24 holes.

1374
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,730
You two are of one fate.

1375
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:01,930
(Are we one team?)

1376
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:04,430
Does that mean we have to stick all 18 of these?

1377
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:07,700
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo will escape if they succeed with the 18 knives.)

1378
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:11,930
(The knives would've decreased if the others chose to stay.)

1379
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:15,530
(The two must now avoid a 75 percent chance of failure.)

1380
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:19,260
- You have six holes down already. - You can do it.

1381
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:20,700
- You can do it. - It's okay.

1382
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:21,930
Let's do it.

1383
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:23,730
(The pirate roulette begins.)

1384
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:26,400
- We are one team. - The others can go to the back.

1385
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,630
Let me watch this first. You're good.

1386
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:30,130
Please tell them to leave.

1387
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:32,130
- Let us watch. - It's better to have us with you.

1388
01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:33,360
Just leave, please.

1389
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,830
Tell them to get off now.

1390
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:36,800
- Let us watch. - It's better to have us with you.

1391
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:38,960
Hurry up and leave. We'll do it on our own.

1392
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,830
Just do it. It's better with us here. You won't be lonely.

1393
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:44,130
(There are 17 knives left.)

1394
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,760
Gosh, Ji Hyo. Goodness.

1395
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,830
- Let's just put it in quickly. - Wait, Ji Hyo.

1396
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:51,430
- We're already done for. - You're right. We're finished.

1397
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:53,800
- We're done. - Separate them.

1398
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,160
- Six. - Gosh.

1399
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:57,430
- Ji Hyo, we're done. - My goodness.

1400
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,160
- Eight. - Hold on.

1401
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:00,560
Wait, Ji Hyo.

1402
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,930
Just put it in, Jae Seok. We're already done for!

1403
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:04,300
- We're done. - Ji Hyo.

1404
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,130
- Ji Hyo, I'm scared. - Three, four,

1405
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,530
- five, six, seven, eight. - There's one hole.

1406
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,100
(Let's go to the end.)

1407
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,000
- Put it in now. Hurry. - There's one there.

1408
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,030
Do you trust my instincts?

1409
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,560
Try putting it all in except for this hole.

1410
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:20,030
- Ji Hyo. - I think you can succeed.

1411
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:22,600
- They just might succeed. - Ji Hyo, you might succeed.

1412
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,260
(There are 9 knives and 15 holes remaining.)

1413
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:26,760
- Look at Ji Hyo. - One, two, three,

1414
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,660
- four, five, six, seven, eight. - Ji Hyo.

1415
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:30,630
- We still have nine knives left. - Hurry up.

1416
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:31,660
There are nine.

1417
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,230
(Jae Seok succeeds with the 9th knife.)

1418
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,660
- I think they'll succeed. - They might succeed, indeed.

1419
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:40,300
- Gosh, this is unbelievable. - Ji Hyo.

1420
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,660
I think they might succeed.

1421
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:43,960
- This is unbelievable. - Ji Hyo.

1422
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,160
(Everyone's nervous now.)

1423
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,200
- Gosh, this is... - I'm...

1424
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:50,900
- Ji Hyo, I'm counting on you. - You can do it, Ji Hyo.

1425
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:52,800
- Ji Hyo's on fire today. - She can do this.

1426
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,930
- Be careful. Don't hurt your face. - Come on, Ji Hyo.

1427
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:57,160
- Did you do one more? - Oh, my gosh.

1428
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,800
(11 holes and 5 knives remaining)

1429
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,300
- She did it. - We're almost there.

1430
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,000
These are all that's left. Ji Hyo there's only five left.

1431
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,660
- Good job. - It's game over.

1432
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:07,130
See this? It would have been much easier if you got at least three.

1433
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:09,500
- Who's next? - Do you hear me?

1434
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,260
- Are we getting off now? - Hold on, where are we?

1435
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:14,700
(1 minute and 30 seconds away from the Prison Station)

1436
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,900
- Time's almost up. - We're almost there.

1437
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,230
- The train will be leaving soon. - It's leaving.

1438
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,000
- We have to get off right now. - Watch out!

1439
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,100
(10 holes and 4 knives remaining)

1440
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,100
(Jae Seok succeeds and only four remains.)

1441
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,260
Don't stick in there. It doesn't feel right.

1442
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,500
Seok Jin, am I supposed to trust your senses?

1443
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,900
I think it'll pop out.

1444
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:31,060
Good job, Ji Hyo. There's only three left.

1445
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:32,860
(9 holes and 3 knives remaining)

1446
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,800
- You go, Jae Seok. - Let's get off the train.

1447
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,100
- We have to get off right now. - Do it.

1448
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,830
- We can do it, Ji Hyo. - How is this possible?

1449
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:41,060
Wait a minute. If Ji Hyo and I succeed, do we get to escape?

1450
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,100
- We go together, right? - Yes.

1451
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,000
- Ji Hyo. - Jae Seok.

1452
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,200
If only they got at least three, we would be on our way out already.

1453
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,000
- Come on. - You're a selfish bunch.

1454
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:50,830
I didn't think they could get this far.

1455
01:03:50,830 --> 01:03:52,900
- Don't think too much. - Time's almost up, Ji Hyo.

1456
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,360
Ji Hyo, I can't do this. Can you do all of them?

1457
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,630
(1 minute away from the Prison Station)

1458
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:00,300
- Jae Seok. - Ji Hyo, you do this.

1459
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:02,600
- I really can't do this. - Okay.

1460
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:03,900
I just want you to know that...

1461
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,260
(Save us from the misery, Ji Hyo.)

1462
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:06,560
I can't guarantee anything.

1463
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,360
Stick it in.

1464
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,900
(In Ji Hyo, we trust!)

1465
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:12,600
You can't tell by looking at it.

1466
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,500
(Luck is always on her side.)

1467
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,300
- I got it. - She got it.

1468
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,830
I wasn't even trying to go for it.

1469
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:20,930
I got another one.

1470
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:22,760
(She was born under a lucky star.)

1471
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,200
- Is this for real? - Oh, my.

1472
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,430
(She caught the golden carp with a probability of 1 out of 2,000.)

1473
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:28,200
I've got the magic pearl.

1474
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,460
How much gold are you taking?

1475
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:32,200
(She is officially the lucky charm of Running Man.)

1476
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:35,800
(I can do this.)

1477
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,360
Here I go.

1478
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:38,560
Stick it in.

1479
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:40,500
(She really did it.)

1480
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:43,200
- Oh, my goodness. - Is this really happening?

1481
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,600
- Just do it already. - Do it.

1482
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,160
- There's no time. - Ji Hyo.

1483
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,960
(They are so close to making the impossible possible.)

1484
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,630
- There's no other way. - I don't know.

1485
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:50,630
Ji Hyo.

1486
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,560
(She's got the golden touch.)

1487
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,960
- This is nothing! - Ji Hyo!

1488
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,100
- I can do this. - I can't believe this.

1489
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:00,900
Ji Hyo, we're almost there.

1490
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,560
- This is nothing. - You can do it.

1491
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,160
I wouldn't have been able to do that.

1492
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,700
(There are seven holes remaining. Their chances of escaping are high.)

1493
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,400
(30 seconds away from the Prison Station)

1494
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:14,630
(They have to stick the last knife in before the time is up.)

1495
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:18,700
(Will they walk free?)

1496
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:22,460
(What will become of Running Man?)

1497
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,530
(A minute later)

1498
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:30,630
(The train has arrived at the Prison Station.)

1499
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,600
(There are prisoners coming out.)

1500
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,160
(Are they headed to the prison or the outside world?)

1501
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:46,360
(The air is cold inside the prison.)

1502
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:49,530
(The guards are waiting for the prisoners.)

1503
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,260
(This place looks creepy.)

1504
01:05:58,260 --> 01:05:59,460
Everyone,

1505
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:01,430
(Did they fail to escape?)

1506
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:02,730
this place...

1507
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:06,700
is the final destination, the Prison Station.

1508
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:09,200
There was supposed to be a final mission here.

1509
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,700
What's the last mission?

1510
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,160
You were to find all the hidden cameras.

1511
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,430
- I see. - That was the mission.

1512
01:06:16,530 --> 01:06:19,630
The moment before you arrived at the Prison Station...

1513
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:26,000
(Did they end up in prison? Or are they free?)

1514
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:28,530
(3 minutes earlier)

1515
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:31,430
Just do it. There's no other way.

1516
01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:32,460
Ji Hyo!

1517
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:36,300
(She sure is lucky.)

1518
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,660
- Ji Hyo! - This is nothing!

1519
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,500
I can do this.

1520
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:43,900
(There's only one knife left.)

1521
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,000
I wouldn't have been able to do that.

1522
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,300
(It all depends on the last knife.)

1523
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:52,160
(What will become of Running Man?)

1524
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,130
(It's a success!)

1525
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:02,760
(We're free now!)

1526
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,400
(Ji Hyo allows everyone to escape the Train to Prison!)

1527
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,700
- I did it! - You did it!

1528
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,930
- Ji Hyo! - I knew I could do this.

1529
01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:11,260
- Jae Seok, I'm sorry. - What now?

1530
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,100
(It's too late for that.)

1531
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,900
It wouldn't have been possible without you.

1532
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,430
(They succeeded with a 25 percent chance.)

1533
01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:17,530
This is unbelievable.

1534
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:19,460
How is this possible?

1535
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,730
- My heart is pounding. - How did you do that?

1536
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:23,530
You feel that?

1537
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:25,900
- I can't believe this. - Ji Hyo.

1538
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,600
If it was me with the knife,

1539
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,100
- it would have been the end of us. - I know.

1540
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:32,000
Ji Hyo did amazing, but I made the right choice by handing it to her.

1541
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:34,360
- I did well. - Does it matter at this point?

1542
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,930
- No, get this. - I did well, too.

1543
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:37,730
- It was meant to be. - This is the thing.

1544
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:40,530
If it weren't for you three, we would've gotten off way earlier.

1545
01:07:40,530 --> 01:07:43,300
- No, it was meant to be. - It's all thanks to Ji Hyo.

1546
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,560
- She's good. I'll give her that. - Hey.

1547
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,730
- I can't believe this. - How is this possible?

1548
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,800
- Stick it in. - Yes, the game is over anyway.

1549
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,600
You try, Jae Seok.

1550
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,930
This isn't broken, is it?

1551
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,200
Hold on. Let me try it.

1552
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,700
Wait a minute.

1553
01:07:58,830 --> 01:07:59,830
(It pops out.)

1554
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:03,100
(The pirate comes right out.)

1555
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,200
- I knew it. - You're one unlucky guy.

1556
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,300
Did you see what happened?

1557
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:07,830
- Ji Hyo is amazing. - Did you see that?

1558
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,360
You're so unlucky.

1559
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:10,960
Wow, Ji Hyo.

1560
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:14,530
(Everyone escapes thanks to Ji Hyo.)

1561
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:17,730
You have successfully completed the mission to escape.

1562
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,300
- You did an amazing job. - It was all her.

1563
01:08:22,930 --> 01:08:25,430
Can we celebrate together? Why are you leaving us out?

1564
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:27,300
- What are you talking about? - We're a team.

1565
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:28,400
It was all me and Ji Hyo.

1566
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,730
- We didn't even have to be there. - Hey, move over.

1567
01:08:30,730 --> 01:08:32,630
We didn't even have to be there.

1568
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:34,400
Why didn't you go, then?

1569
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,800
You could have gotten off before the final destination.

1570
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,170
You missed it while watching others.

1571
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:40,460
- Why were we just watching? - You should have said something.

1572
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:43,900
- We were cheering for them. - That's right.

1573
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,060
You will now get to go...

1574
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:49,560
on the runaway vehicle.

1575
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,700
- Can we go? - Which vehicle is it?

1576
01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:53,100
- Let's go. - Thank you.

1577
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,530
You should be thankful to us.

1578
01:08:55,530 --> 01:08:57,700
You don't have to work during the holidays.

1579
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,170
Some might want to work.

1580
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:02,200
- Thank you, everybody. - Thank you, everybody.

1581
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:03,800
Let's go.

1582
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:05,530
It's time to get out of here.

1583
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,670
- We're finally out. - Yes.

1584
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:11,130
- Oh, there's a car waiting for us. - It's the runaway vehicle.

1585
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:15,460
(Freedom!)

1586
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,430
(Meanwhile, others are...)

1587
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:21,400
I'll take one for the team.

1588
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:25,000
They must be hungry right now.

1589
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:26,630
Let's enjoy this party.

1590
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:28,730
- Freedom! - Freedom!

1591
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,170
Am I really going home?

1592
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:35,730
I'm going home.

1593
01:09:35,730 --> 01:09:37,670
(One might think that he's getting off work early.)

1594
01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:43,100
(We've made the impossible possible.)

1595
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:46,700
(Now we enjoy freedom together.)

1596
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:47,830
Thank you.

1597
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,200
- Give it to those two. - They deserve it.

1598
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,500
- Good job, you guys. - Thank you.

1599
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,560
-Thank you, everyone. - Thank you.

1600
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,000
(Welcome back.)

1601
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,400
- Thank you. - Thanks for coming out here.

1602
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,460
Let's get in the car.

1603
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,500
(It's the runaway vehicle to Seoul.)

1604
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,300
- We're going to Seoul. - Yes, we are.

1605
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:05,600
Thank you. We'll live happily ever after.

1606
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:06,730
Goodbye.

1607
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:07,760
(Isn't that what you say after the wedding?)

1608
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,100
- Thank you, everyone. - Goodbye.

1609
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:13,900
(What will happen to the members on their way to Seoul?)

1610
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:19,100
This is the questionnaire required for today's missions.

1611
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,360
"What's the special episode that I would like to be in?"

1612
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:22,630
Oh, that scared me.

1613
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:26,800
(What's going on in here?)

1614
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:30,960
This room is creepy.

1615
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:32,460
Do it.

1616
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:33,700
What was that?

1617
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:35,460
(There's someone else in here.)

1618
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,330
I'm sweating. Who's there?

1619
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,930
(He is here to take revenge.)

1620
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:41,100
It won't be like last time.

1621
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:42,670
Just do as I say!

1622
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:44,400
Can you be more careful?

1623
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:45,560
He's not interested.

1624
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,670
This is a long day.

1625
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:50,360
(Running Man versus The Avengers, The Battle of Revenge)
