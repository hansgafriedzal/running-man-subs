1
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,801
(The smell of the sea fills a romantic city, Busan.)

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,949
These dishes are famous.

3
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:14,309
These dishes in front of you...

4
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:18,149
are three dishes that Busan is known for.

5
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:20,909
These are Dongnae pajeon, eels,

6
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:22,809
and pork gukbap.

7
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:24,709
Each team will choose one dish.

8
00:00:24,709 --> 00:00:26,009
- We want pork gukbap. - We'll choose pork gukbap.

9
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:28,209
- We said it first. - Who told you to pick first?

10
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:30,309
- We said it first. - We'll take the eels.

11
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:32,049
You can't do that.

12
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:33,609
- Let's have pork gukbap. - The thing is,

13
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:36,079
- I want gukbap. - I'm the team leader.

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,679
- We'll have eel. - Come on.

15
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:39,979
- We want eel. - But I said I wanted it.

16
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:41,109
What did you say?

17
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:42,649
- I just said that I wanted the eel. - So what?

18
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:44,309
- We'll have eel. - Ji Hyo.

19
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:46,109
We want eel, too.

20
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:48,609
- Can we get eel? - We want eel, too.

21
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:50,309
I've been craving some eel for a long time.

22
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:52,109
We should sort this out by rock-paper-scissors.

23
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:53,779
- Let's do that. - Okay.

24
00:00:53,779 --> 00:00:55,649
- You should do it. - Rock-paper-scissors.

25
00:00:57,009 --> 00:00:58,109
Nice.

26
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:00,609
(He laughs in embarrassment.)

27
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:02,749
- I'm always the unlucky one. - You are.

28
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:05,509
- This is really strange. - This is nice.

29
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:09,579
Today, we will do Busan Crossword Puzzle Race.

30
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:11,409
Busan Vacance

31
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:16,179
(They have to find the restaurants recommended by the people of Busan.)

32
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:21,409
We have guests who will join you with Busan Crossword Puzzle Race.

33
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:22,979
I wonder who it is.

34
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:25,609
- Are you serious? - Please come out.

35
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:27,949
(Who will join Running Man here in Busan today?)

36
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:33,209
- Oh, my. - I can't stop smiling.

37
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:38,709
(Here we come.)

38
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:46,379
(It's everyone's favorite girl group, Twice.)

39
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:52,249
(They swept the charts with their latest release, "TT".)

40
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:54,809
- "TT". - "TT".

41
00:01:54,809 --> 00:01:57,709
- Ji Hyo. - I watched this yesterday.

42
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:59,009
(It's the famous dance Ji Hyo wanted to learn.)

43
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:02,549
- It's "TT". - This is so great.

44
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,619
(It's "TT" time.)

45
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:11,279
- It's "TT". - This is so great.

46
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:13,409
- They're so cute. - I can't believe I get to see this.

47
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:20,349
(Twice is here.)

48
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,409
(This is the dance.)

49
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:29,009
- So mean - That's the dance.

50
00:02:29,619 --> 00:02:31,349
(Jae Seok is a big fan.)

51
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:32,749
(Is this how you do it?)

52
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:38,679
(This is their legendary hit song, "Cheer Up".)

53
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:40,249
I'm sorry

54
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:43,209
(Shy, shy, shy)

55
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,779
(Let's make some noise.)

56
00:02:45,779 --> 00:02:48,079
(They take soft steps.)

57
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,279
I'll call you a little later

58
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:52,949
(Exclaiming)

59
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:57,179
(The song is reaching its climax.)

60
00:02:57,179 --> 00:02:58,279
Let's go!

61
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:00,849
Let's make some noise!

62
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:07,379
(It's a therapeutic song that will make your pain go away.)

63
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:08,909
This is nice.

64
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,209
(It's a smooth finish.)

65
00:03:18,749 --> 00:03:21,909
(The crowd is going wild.)

66
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:23,349
They're so cute.

67
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:24,979
Welcome, Twice.

68
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:26,509
(Today's guest is Twice.)

69
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:29,449
- Hello, we are Twice. - Hello, we are Twice.

70
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:32,749
Thanks for sparing your time for us.

71
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,679
Oh, my.

72
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,349
Hello, everyone.

73
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:39,479
Their new song, "TT",

74
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:42,179
- is doing so well on the charts. - It's a big hit.

75
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:46,509
Everyone around the globe is going crazy over Twice.

76
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:49,609
It's nice to see you again. We did a race together once.

77
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:51,379
There are three teams at the moment.

78
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:54,079
We prepared a game where you can be divided into different teams.

79
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,949
In front of you are the three most famous foods in Busan.

80
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,149
There are nine members of Twice with us today.

81
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:02,379
Maximum of three people can choose the same food.

82
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:04,349
We don't really care which one you pick.

83
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:06,549
- We like everyone. - That's right.

84
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:08,849
- Just pick what you want to eat. - Can I pick now?

85
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,479
- Yes. - Here I go.

86
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,449
(Da Hyun starts off.)

87
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:15,149
Please choose pork gukbap.

88
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:16,919
- Have you guys already decided? - They already know.

89
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:18,279
We'll all be teamed up with them.

90
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:22,379
(Three people picked pork gukbap.)

91
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:23,779
- I want eel. - Eel?

92
00:04:24,549 --> 00:04:27,849
Four of you are lined up for Dongnae pajeon.

93
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:29,349
You should do rock-paper-scissors.

94
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:30,509
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

95
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:31,609
(Rock-paper-scissors is always a good solution.)

96
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:33,209
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

97
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:39,809
- That was quick. - I feel bad for her.

98
00:04:39,809 --> 00:04:41,679
She was the first one to line up for it.

99
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:45,979
She had her eyes on pajeon since the beginning.

100
00:04:46,179 --> 00:04:47,649
I feel bad for you.

101
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:49,009
(I feel like crying.)

102
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:53,549
(Team Dongnae Pajeon, Team Eel, Team Pork Gukbap)

103
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:56,349
Today's race is called Busan Crossword Puzzle Race.

104
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:58,809
You have to fill out your crossword puzzles...

105
00:04:58,809 --> 00:05:02,579
with the names of the food recommended by the people of Busan.

106
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:04,509
When you complete a single row,

107
00:05:04,749 --> 00:05:07,979
you have to move to a different spot and proceed there.

108
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:12,779
There are two chance spots where you can earn advantages.

109
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:16,149
If you succeed the mission, you can fill out two rows...

110
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:19,249
from a single menu.

111
00:05:19,549 --> 00:05:21,949
You'll get a One Plus One Card.

112
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:24,149
One Plus One Card?

113
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,679
If you fill out the red boxes of the crossword puzzle,

114
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:34,909
you can remove a menu from another team's crossword puzzle.

115
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:36,909
I don't like that.

116
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,849
Why did you have to put those in there?

117
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:42,479
The team to finish five different menus first...

118
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:46,009
will win benefits they can use in the final race.

119
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,549
We will now begin a team game...

120
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:52,009
where you can test your team work.

121
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:54,309
(Team Work Mission gets started.)

122
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:55,579
The first mission is...

123
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:59,479
"Twice Statues".

124
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:02,979
While the person in front sings, "Twice Statues",

125
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:07,449
the teams will compete to finish their food the fastest.

126
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:11,179
The team that comes in first place will be able...

127
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:14,849
to fill out their crossword puzzle with the food they ate.

128
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:16,009
I see.

129
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,309
(Which team will finish this package meal first?)

130
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:20,179
How should we do this?

131
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:22,449
- Who likes coke? - Jong Kook.

132
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,249
You can drink the coke, Jong Kook.

133
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:26,649
If I drank two cans of coke,

134
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:27,979
(Jong Kook never drinks carbonated drinks.)

135
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:30,579
(Bottoms up, Jong Kook.)

136
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:33,049
Can I get diet coke instead?

137
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:34,949
(He's very picky.)

138
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:37,279
Just drink it.

139
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,609
Just drink it. That's not important right now.

140
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,249
You want me to drink both?

141
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:45,079
That's 224 calories.

142
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,749
Just drink it!

143
00:06:46,749 --> 00:06:49,349
- Just drink it. - Just drink it already.

144
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:51,409
- Look how disappointed Mina is. - Look at her.

145
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:53,079
The person who will help us with the game...

146
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:55,109
is Yoo Kwon Ryeol.

147
00:06:55,109 --> 00:06:57,209
(Twice lover, Yoo Kwon Ryeol)

148
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,409
It's Kwon Ryeol.

149
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:00,979
Don't look back so often just to see their faces.

150
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:05,949
(This is the man...)

151
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:07,449
(who was head over heels for Twice last summer.)

152
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:08,909
Look at him.

153
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,609
- Gosh. - What do you think you're doing?

154
00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:13,309
You're blocking all the cameras.

155
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,209
(It's me again.)

156
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:17,549
(Long time no see.)

157
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:19,109
Pick up your chopsticks.

158
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:20,249
Ready...

159
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:25,409
(Who will eat faster?)

160
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:26,549
Ready, set, go.

161
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:30,349
(The mission gets started.)

162
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,809
Twice Statues

163
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:35,109
(Twice Statues)

164
00:07:35,109 --> 00:07:38,849
(They have to stop moving when he turns back.)

165
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,809
(Pause screen)

166
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:47,949
(Glaring)

167
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,209
(He sneaks some food in his mouth.)

168
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:53,679
Twice Statues

169
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:56,009
(Twice Statues)

170
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:59,449
(She froze.)

171
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:01,179
(Can you let us eat this tteokbokki?)

172
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:04,349
(Coughing)

173
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:06,809
(Drinking coke can be dangerous.)

174
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,379
(Jeong Yeon caught the eyes of Kwon Ryeol.)

175
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:10,509
Da Hyun just...

176
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:13,449
Da Hyun just...

177
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:20,609
(Da Hyun didn't do anything.)

178
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:21,809
Da Hyun just...

179
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:24,009
smiled back at me.

180
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,709
- What are you talking about? - She smiled at me.

181
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,309
- Who would smile at you? - Okay.

182
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,779
Why are you blushing?

183
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:31,979
(Kwon Ryeol is taking full advantage of this game.)

184
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,019
If you caught someone, just say it.

185
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,779
What do you mean, "Okay"?

186
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,479
Call Da Hyun out if she moved.

187
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:40,409
- She smiled at me. - Gosh.

188
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:41,709
(He's too biased.)

189
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:43,019
(Thank you.)

190
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,349
(Is he going to be a better judge this time?)

191
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:52,349
Seok Jin's eomuk moved.

192
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,649
Seok Jin is out.

193
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,209
I thought that was his tongue.

194
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,019
That looks like his tongue.

195
00:08:57,179 --> 00:08:59,079
It was this eomuk, not me.

196
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:02,019
Seok Jin is out. Please go over there.

197
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:03,109
(He's strict all of a sudden.)

198
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,649
- But this is... - Please leave.

199
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:07,909
But it was the eomuk that moved.

200
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:12,349
You should punish the eomuk, not me.

201
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:13,779
(Laughing)

202
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:15,909
Ji Hyo just laughed.

203
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:18,149
Ji Hyo is still laughing.

204
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:19,879
Ji Hyo is out.

205
00:09:20,349 --> 00:09:22,209
(You're so mean.)

206
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:29,449
(Team Jong Kook is leading.)

207
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:30,909
Twice Statues

208
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:36,019
Where are you going?

209
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:37,809
(What are they up to now?)

210
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,949
(They're serious.)

211
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:41,909
Why did they get up? What are they planning?

212
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:45,079
(Moving swiftly)

213
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:48,079
(They form a barricade.)

214
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:51,379
(This is their chance to eat away.)

215
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:52,479
That's smart.

216
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,709
(Surprised)

217
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:55,679
- They're still eating. - They're not.

218
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:57,709
They're still eating behind the wall.

219
00:09:58,149 --> 00:09:59,609
They're still eating.

220
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:00,709
(Kwon Ryeol walks over.)

221
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:04,849
- Keep eating. - Twice Statues

222
00:10:04,849 --> 00:10:07,309
(What's this?)

223
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:11,649
(He's man-marking Team Haha.)

224
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:13,049
(What are you going to do now?)

225
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:17,679
(The other two teams eat away while Team Haha can't do anything.)

226
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:19,409
- Kwang Soo is out. - No way.

227
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:21,849
(Kwang Soo is out.)

228
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:24,849
Kwang Soo just ate something.

229
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:26,849
- What are you talking about? - His mouth moved.

230
00:10:26,849 --> 00:10:27,879
(I don't know what you're saying, but I get that you're upset.)

231
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,409
We're allowed to eat while he's singing, "Twice Statues".

232
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:31,449
Kwang Soo is out.

233
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:32,809
(Swallowing)

234
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:35,149
Jae Seok is still drinking his soup!

235
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:37,409
(Spouting)

236
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:38,849
He's still drinking his soup!

237
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:41,579
- His mouth is sticky. - We're done.

238
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:43,779
(I got it on me!)

239
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:45,079
- We're done. - We're done.

240
00:10:46,849 --> 00:10:48,709
- They're done? - Aren't they out?

241
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:51,109
I finished eating.

242
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:53,409
(The judge clears Jae Seok and Seok Jin's team.)

243
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:55,079
- Yes! - That's not fair.

244
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:57,879
Momo ate a lot of it.

245
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:59,049
This tteokbokki is really good.

246
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:01,079
- It is really good. - It's really good.

247
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:02,309
It's awesome.

248
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:04,509
- We were done, too. - Let's just eat.

249
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:06,009
We were done, too.

250
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:09,349
The winner of "Twice Statues"...

251
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:10,679
is Jae Seok and Seok Jin's team.

252
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,309
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin's team wins.)

253
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:13,449
What a great start!

254
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:16,109
- How incredible. They eat a lot. - They do.

255
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,949
The three of them helped out a lot.

256
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:21,909
The first place team will be awarded with the dish...

257
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:24,609
- to fill their crossword puzzle. - Is that right?

258
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:26,349
- It was Dongnae pajeon. - We'll deliver it to you.

259
00:11:26,349 --> 00:11:29,179
(Dongnae pajeon)

260
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:31,409
The race starts now.

261
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:34,709
Jae Seok and Seok Jin's team can eat here,

262
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:36,609
and the other two teams will get moving first.

263
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:38,009
- All right. - Let's go.

264
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:39,349
Can we go after we eat, then?

265
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:42,449
I can guess which one that could be.

266
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:47,209
- We have to make up words that fit. - "Haha's favorite pork gukbap."

267
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:50,079
"Haha's favorite food is pork gukbap."

268
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,749
I can use abbreviations, right?

269
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,979
You can only use words that are in the dictionary.

270
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:57,449
What about "green onions in pork gukbap"?

271
00:11:57,609 --> 00:11:59,479
Then you only get to eat the green onion.

272
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:00,809
"Demolishing pork gukbap".

273
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:02,709
That works.

274
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:03,949
- You can do that. - Okay.

275
00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:06,349
- How do you eat it? - "Demolishing pork gukbap".

276
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,409
(Jae Seok's team finishes their pajeon.)

277
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:11,149
This person must be really picky to demolish their gukbap.

278
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:13,309
We made 1 word, right? There's 4 left?

279
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:14,949
- We have 4 left. - We did Dongnae pajeon.

280
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:17,479
It's not difficult filling this in.

281
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:18,809
We just have to meet a local.

282
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,109
Where is your hometown?

283
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,849
(He starts asking the staff members.)

284
00:12:22,849 --> 00:12:23,879
Where is your hometown?

285
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:25,549
Yours?

286
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:27,249
- I'm not from here. - And...

287
00:12:27,249 --> 00:12:29,809
Can't we just lie? Right?

288
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:31,509
- Yes. - It doesn't show.

289
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:33,579
Nobody's from Busan. Where is your hometown?

290
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:34,849
- Where is your hometown? - I'm from Busan.

291
00:12:34,849 --> 00:12:37,209
They're from Busan.

292
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:39,909
- They're from Busan. - That's right.

293
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:42,049
- Are you really from Busan? - That's right.

294
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:44,409
- Is that right? - "That's right"? That sounds funny.

295
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:45,949
Say my name in Busan dialect.

296
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:46,979
Seok Jin.

297
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:48,079
She is from here.

298
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:49,509
Where's your hometown again?

299
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:51,009
It's Busan.

300
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,409
Weren't you from Kyoto?

301
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:55,079
- It's Busan. - It is.

302
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:57,149
- Didn't you say Kyoto? - Say my name in Busan dialect.

303
00:12:57,149 --> 00:12:58,979
- Seok Jin. - See?

304
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:00,409
- What about you, Jeong Yeon? - It's Busan.

305
00:13:00,409 --> 00:13:01,449
She's from Busan, too.

306
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:03,409
(They're all from Busan now.)

307
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:04,779
You're all locals?

308
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:07,009
- Yes. - We know the geography well.

309
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:09,309
- Is that right? - I'm from here as well.

310
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:12,909
I wonder which restaurant has good eels.

311
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:15,049
Should we go near our next destination?

312
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:17,309
Let's go to an eel restaurant near Gukje Market.

313
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:19,049
All right. Let's go there.

314
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:22,109
Let's go there and try all the missions in the area.

315
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:25,649
That's not important. We need to feed them good food...

316
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:28,049
and have some fun. Don't you agree?

317
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,079
Sure.

318
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:31,879
I'm just happy that I'm with them.

319
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,349
We're not doing this so that you can be happy.

320
00:13:33,349 --> 00:13:35,649
I'm still happy though. Aren't you all happy?

321
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:37,909
- We are happy. - See?

322
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:39,779
(They unite over Twice.)

323
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:42,049
Don't worry about it. It doesn't matter.

324
00:13:42,109 --> 00:13:45,209
Let's have good food and play some fun games.

325
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:46,809
I'll look it up on the navigation.

326
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:48,379
Let's just go to the nearest one.

327
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,879
It's best if we go to a good restaurant.

328
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:54,079
There's one 370m away. It only takes a minute from here.

329
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:55,649
Really? Let's go.

330
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:57,209
(They get going right away.)

331
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:58,249
Let's go.

332
00:13:58,249 --> 00:14:00,709
I'm so sad it took Twice this long to come back.

333
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:04,749
Shouldn't they stay overnight?

334
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:06,379
Twice is busier than you guys.

335
00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:09,049
You didn't have to say that.

336
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:10,509
- We know that. - We do.

337
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:12,209
We know but that's not what we meant.

338
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:16,309
We want to go overseas with Twice.

339
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:19,149
- Thank you. - I want to go overseas.

340
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,979
Look at Sana's face. What should we do now?

341
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,349
I hope you make a lot of money, Sana.

342
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:28,209
Sana, Sana

343
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:30,709
Sana money, Sana

344
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,049
(They find it funny.)

345
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:34,279
Don't worry

346
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:36,009
How do you know this song?

347
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,009
Of course, I do. It's my song.

348
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:41,409
- Sana money. - Money.

349
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:42,409
(It's from a loan commercial.)

350
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:43,609
Are we here already?

351
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:45,709
- We are here! - There's no seasoning on it.

352
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:47,079
(They arrive at the pork gukbap restaurant.)

353
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:48,079
Where is it?

354
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:49,709
Where's the pork gukbap restaurant?

355
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:51,079
- Pork gukbap! - Here it is!

356
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:52,609
I think they're famous.

357
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:54,679
- Hello. - Hello

358
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:57,049
- Hello. - Hello

359
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:00,109
(Busan is known for their pork gukbap.)

360
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:02,109
Can we have two pork gukbap?

361
00:15:02,909 --> 00:15:05,749
Let's order first.

362
00:15:06,349 --> 00:15:08,309
- Write down the menu. - Sure.

363
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:10,809
(Pork gukbap)

364
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,909
No other team was here, right?

365
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:14,579
Thank you.

366
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,509
- Thank you. - Thank you.

367
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:18,479
Thank you.

368
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,909
You have to add a lot of chives.

369
00:15:20,909 --> 00:15:21,979
Make sure you add a lot.

370
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:23,509
Thank you for the food.

371
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:24,709
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

372
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:26,509
Thank you for the food.

373
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:27,709
Thank you.

374
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:30,409
- Did I add too much? - Thank you.

375
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:31,509
(Slurping)

376
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:33,679
- It's really good. - It is.

377
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:35,879
(It's the best pork gukbap ever.)

378
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:39,579
How do you describe this?

379
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:42,079
It's my first time having pork gukbap.

380
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,509
- Really? - Yes.

381
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,049
The meat is soft...

382
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:48,509
and it tastes nice.

383
00:15:48,609 --> 00:15:50,009
- It's nice? - Yes.

384
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:52,879
She sounds like an angel.

385
00:15:52,979 --> 00:15:54,809
- I think it tastes nice. - Yes, Haha.

386
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:55,979
(Slurping)

387
00:15:57,209 --> 00:15:58,209
(The more you eat, the better it tastes.)

388
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:00,079
It's really good.

389
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:01,479
It's great.

390
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:05,609
(The girls love it.)

391
00:16:05,609 --> 00:16:07,309
They love it.

392
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,709
You must have been hungry.

393
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:10,979
I'm happy you ate a lot.

394
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:13,479
We're right by Haeundae beach.

395
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:14,809
What would you like to eat, Momo?

396
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:16,279
- Meat. - Where?

397
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:17,409
(Where are you talking about?)

398
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,509
- She meant meat. - Meat?

399
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:22,179
I thought she wanted to go somewhere.

400
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:23,879
- I thought she wanted to go there. - You meant meat.

401
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,279
I thought we talked about a place already.

402
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:27,509
What about you, Na Yeon?

403
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:29,109
I want Eonyang bulgogi.

404
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:31,209
- Eonyang bulgogi is good. - I like jjajangmyeon, too.

405
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:32,349
You all like meat.

406
00:16:32,349 --> 00:16:34,349
Should we start with Eonyang bulgogi, then?

407
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:36,509
- Yes. - Let's do that, then.

408
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:38,879
- Momo looks so happy. - Do we have control over that?

409
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:41,679
We can meet a local person and give them a hint.

410
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,779
We can insinuate that we'd like Eonyang bulgogi.

411
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:47,509
Haha and Kwang Soo's team had pork gukbap.

412
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:48,609
Already?

413
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:51,909
- "Demolishing pork gukbap". - What does that mean?

414
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:55,349
Then let's do this.

415
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:58,949
- "Local Eonyang bulgogi". - Sure.

416
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:01,579
- That works, right? - We can continue this way.

417
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:04,279
- That's right. - She's right.

418
00:17:04,509 --> 00:17:06,879
Once we get that, we can erase other people's words.

419
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:08,409
- We should reach there fast. - That's right.

420
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:09,509
That's right.

421
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:12,149
You pointed out something crucial, Jeong Yeon.

422
00:17:12,149 --> 00:17:13,409
We should get there fast, then.

423
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:14,609
That's right.

424
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,279
We can do "everybody's favorite Eonyang bulgogi".

425
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:18,449
That's right. "Everybody's favorite Eonyang bulgogi".

426
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:19,979
Who came up with it?

427
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:23,609
(High-five)

428
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,049
(Maybe not.)

429
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:26,719
- Can I not high-five her? - Why?

430
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:29,679
Why would you do that? Na Yeon doesn't want to.

431
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,149
I was proud of her.

432
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:32,219
(They're funny.)

433
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:33,909
- We're at Haeundae. - Let's get off.

434
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:35,779
It's been a while since I've been here.

435
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:38,149
Let's talk to the locals before we ask them for words.

436
00:17:38,149 --> 00:17:41,009
Let's mention that we want to eat meat.

437
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:43,719
Let's go. Look at this.

438
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,179
- The weather's great. - It is.

439
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:47,179
- Look at the water. - Girls.

440
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:49,109
Let's look at the water first.

441
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,609
- Sure. - This is Haeundae.

442
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:53,279
It's windy.

443
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:55,579
It's the ocean!

444
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:57,679
Isn't it great?

445
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,909
I think it's warm enough to play in the water.

446
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:02,219
(They're greeted by the winter ocean.)

447
00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:04,009
It feels like summer.

448
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:06,149
(They're so excited.)

449
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:07,409
I can't open my eyes.

450
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:08,609
This is amazing.

451
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:12,509
Seagulls are not even flying away. They're enjoying the water, too.

452
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:14,979
- They don't care. - Look at the seagulls.

453
00:18:14,979 --> 00:18:17,779
They're tanning. They look pretty.

454
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:18,979
They're not flying away.

455
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:22,949
(The girls start chasing the seagulls.)

456
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:24,879
They are so excited.

457
00:18:25,249 --> 00:18:26,609
Na Yeon must like babies.

458
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:28,109
She does.

459
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:29,579
(Na Yeon's heart is stolen by a little boy nearby.)

460
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:31,509
She must like babies.

461
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,049
She loves babies.

462
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:35,479
I can see that.

463
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:37,109
Are you locals?

464
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,609
- That's great. - Excuse us.

465
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:41,849
- Excuse us. - Hello.

466
00:18:42,219 --> 00:18:45,719
We are going to have a light lunch.

467
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:47,979
We all know that Busan is known for great food.

468
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:49,609
Don't answer right away.

469
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:51,249
- Don't say it yet. - Not yet.

470
00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:52,719
Please listen to us first.

471
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:57,249
We have to go eat. Do you like meat?

472
00:18:57,249 --> 00:18:59,409
(He attempts to insinuate.)

473
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:03,009
- Yes. - We want to have meat.

474
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,149
(Do you get it?)

475
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:06,379
Roasted clams.

476
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:09,219
(Roasted clams?)

477
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:11,349
(The insinuation has failed.)

478
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:15,049
- Roasted clams? - I told her not to say it.

479
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:17,219
(She likes meat but she recommended roasted clams.)

480
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:21,479
- I told her not to speak yet. - I wish you would have waited.

481
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:24,109
- Roasted clams? - Okay, roasted clams it is.

482
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:26,079
Thank you!

483
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:27,679
Thank you.

484
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:29,449
Do you like roasted clams?

485
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:31,879
Do restaurants open this early?

486
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:34,379
Are there restaurants nearby?

487
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:37,449
We have to find a restaurant that has roasted clams.

488
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,449
There's one.

489
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:41,579
Do you see one at the end?

490
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:43,049
It's by the waterfront.

491
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:44,949
We have to go that far?

492
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:48,409
I mentioned this before...

493
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:51,409
- but they don't open this early. - They don't. They open at night.

494
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:53,049
We have to eat if they're open, right?

495
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:54,409
We do.

496
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:56,109
But roasted clams are not served this early.

497
00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:57,979
(They hope the owner of the restaurant slept in.)

498
00:19:58,679 --> 00:19:59,779
Sir.

499
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:01,009
- Hello. - Hello.

500
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:02,609
- Hello. - Hello.

501
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:06,109
Do you have roasted clams?

502
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:10,679
(Do you serve roasted clams this early in the morning?)

503
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:11,909
Yes.

504
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,609
You don't serve them this early, right?

505
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,079
We can.

506
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:17,479
- You can? - Right now?

507
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:19,079
Yes.

508
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,719
Do you serve them in the evening?

509
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,679
You usually don't serve them during the day, right?

510
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:23,949
We do.

511
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:26,049
- You do? - Let's eat.

512
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,849
- Roasted clams. - Let's eat.

513
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:30,349
- We'll give you extra. - Let's eat.

514
00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:31,549
We'll have roasted clams.

515
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:33,079
I didn't mean to ask such question.

516
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:36,479
(The clams look as delicious as Eonyang bulgogi.)

517
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:38,849
- Let's finish this line. - That's right.

518
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:41,109
"Everyone loves roasted clams."

519
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:44,379
We can also finish this one with "Eonyang bulgogi is awesome."

520
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:47,219
We can write "Eonyang bulgogi tastes awesome."

521
00:20:48,109 --> 00:20:51,609
- That'll do it. - Other teams might do it, too.

522
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:53,749
- Okay. - But it feels like summer here.

523
00:20:53,749 --> 00:20:55,879
I can't believe they serve roasted clams at this time.

524
00:20:56,449 --> 00:20:59,509
People usually don't eat roasted clams for lunch.

525
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,949
- Look at that. - Here you go.

526
00:21:00,949 --> 00:21:02,809
(There's an abundance of side dishes.)

527
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:04,609
- Half-dried herrings are in season. - It's half-dried herring.

528
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:06,379
The side dishes alone are enough for lunch.

529
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:10,809
We used to put shells in bags and sell them.

530
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:12,379
- Have you eaten one? - How do you eat it?

531
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:14,379
- Put the wider part in your mouth. - And suck it.

532
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:15,649
- Suck it up. - Suck it.

533
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,349
- This is delicious. - Goodness.

534
00:21:17,449 --> 00:21:18,509
Isn't that amazing?

535
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:19,949
Isn't that amazing?

536
00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:21,749
(He hears a laughter.)

537
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:23,679
I'm sorry.

538
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:24,679
(Excuse me.)

539
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:27,279
- Is this your first time trying it? - Why are you laughing suddenly?

540
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:30,509
- Why are you laughing? - She eats it so well.

541
00:21:30,949 --> 00:21:32,049
Is this your first time eating it?

542
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:35,479
- Yes. - I sold these on the streets.

543
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:36,679
(We love gastropods.)

544
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:38,879
- It's really good. - Isn't it?

545
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:41,579
It's better if you eat it while it's hot.

546
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:43,749
Goodness.

547
00:21:43,749 --> 00:21:44,979
(Goodness.)

548
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:45,979
No, I don't want it.

549
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:48,849
(Laughing)

550
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:49,849
Why are you laughing?

551
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:52,909
- Why do you keep laughing? - Why are you laughing?

552
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:56,179
Why does Na Yeon's enjoying her food make you laugh?

553
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:58,579
It's not like you're eating it.

554
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:03,209
When people eat on a Japanese show, they would say,

555
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:05,709
- "It's delicious." - "It's delicious."

556
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:12,049
- Now, it's all cooked. Dig in. - Thank you.

557
00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:14,309
- This is really tasty. - It's delicious.

558
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:16,279
(She takes a bite.)

559
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:17,409
- Isn't it good? - Yes.

560
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:19,549
It's authentic.

561
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:22,109
(At this moment, they forget about bulgogi.)

562
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:23,309
Seaweed soup is great.

563
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:28,849
(She finds it very tasty.)

564
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:29,879
Is it that good?

565
00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:31,979
(Her reaction says all about the roasted clams.)

566
00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:34,079
- She expresses herself well. - Right.

567
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:36,849
Jeong Yeon is quiet, but she expresses...

568
00:22:36,979 --> 00:22:38,479
with her face.

569
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:39,849
Na Yeon expresses with her voice.

570
00:22:41,249 --> 00:22:42,579
It's my first time eating roasted clams.

571
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,449
- Seriously? - This is your first time?

572
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,479
This is really your first time having roasted clams?

573
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:49,809
- Then it all worked out. - This is great then.

574
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:51,949
It's amazing.

575
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:54,979
If someone recommends this again, do we have to eat this again?

576
00:22:54,979 --> 00:22:56,479
- Yes. - Yes, we have to eat it again.

577
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:58,849
Maybe we should ask the question in front of...

578
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,549
- a bulgogi restaurant. - That could work.

579
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:04,349
Let's look for the closest one from here and one that'll serve quickly.

580
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,509
Or we could ask the restaurant's owner.

581
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:09,849
- Can't we? - Should we do that?

582
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:11,549
- We can ask the owner. - The owner must be a resident here.

583
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:13,409
- That's cheating though. - I guess so.

584
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:16,649
Where is the restaurant for eels? Here it is. Let's go inside.

585
00:23:17,949 --> 00:23:19,579
(They came to fill out the line for eels.)

586
00:23:19,579 --> 00:23:20,749
Goodness.

587
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:22,379
I'm glad it's not crowded.

588
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:23,979
- Hello. - Let's go in.

589
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,109
- Can we order? - We filled in Dongnae pajeon.

590
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:30,009
"A famous restaurant..."

591
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,779
- "for eels." - "For eels."

592
00:23:31,979 --> 00:23:34,209
This is excellent.

593
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:36,809
Last week, Ji Hyo tried to do your choreography.

594
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:38,309
I did it wrong.

595
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:41,579
I was angry that I had to watch the music video before going to sleep.

596
00:23:41,749 --> 00:23:43,849
(Last week)

597
00:23:44,449 --> 00:23:48,579
(Her dance stirred up resentment among the members.)

598
00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:50,949
- She did watch the music video. - Really?

599
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:54,579
She couldn't help but watch.

600
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:56,409
You should demonstrate for her.

601
00:23:56,409 --> 00:23:58,909
- This is how you do it, right? - Yes.

602
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:00,809
(This is how you do it.)

603
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:02,449
Just like TT

604
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:06,049
You don't know how I feel, you're mean

605
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:07,749
It's true.

606
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,509
You are mean.

607
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:11,179
Goodness.

608
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:12,449
(Do you want to try again, Ji Hyo?)

609
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:16,409
Just have your fingers ready and tilt your head a little.

610
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:17,979
Ji Hyo, try it one more time.

611
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:19,379
- In 1, 2, and 3. - In 1, 2, and 3.

612
00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:21,079
I'm like TT

613
00:24:21,509 --> 00:24:24,579
(She isn't as young as them, but she challenges herself.)

614
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:28,679
You don't know how I feel, you're mean

615
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:29,949
You're mean

616
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:32,479
Yes, it's true. You are mean, Ji Hyo.

617
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:34,349
You're mean, too.

618
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:36,879
(Cute)

619
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:40,109
(For Ji Hyo, sobbing fits better.)

620
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:43,209
Crying turned into sobbing.

621
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:44,949
Look, they're moving.

622
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:46,349
Goodness. They're alive.

623
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:47,879
- They're alive. - They're moving. Are they alive?

624
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:49,409
Yes, they're alive.

625
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:53,349
(Live eels are served.)

626
00:24:53,349 --> 00:24:56,209
- This is amazing. - I'm surprised they're alive.

627
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:58,949
(It's a special dish and you can taste the freshness of the sea.)

628
00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:01,109
I can see they're alive.

629
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:02,349
- They're trying to get out. - It's scary.

630
00:25:02,409 --> 00:25:05,209
- How am I going to eat this? - What a scene. Look at the tails.

631
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:06,649
I think they might get out.

632
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:09,609
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

633
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:10,979
- Thank you. - Enjoy it.

634
00:25:10,979 --> 00:25:14,109
Mina, you can eat them now.

635
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:16,179
You can eat now. Dig in.

636
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:18,849
- I know that. - Do you? Okay.

637
00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:20,809
- What's wrong? - It's good.

638
00:25:21,249 --> 00:25:22,649
(I can taste the sea in my mouth.)

639
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:23,879
The onions are good.

640
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:27,379
- It's delicious. - Goodness.

641
00:25:27,379 --> 00:25:28,409
(Chae Young cools it down before she eats it.)

642
00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:29,949
I can dip it in the sauce.

643
00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:33,509
I wouldn't have guessed they were alive.

644
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:36,879
The texture is really different.

645
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,849
You can call...

646
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:40,949
(How can you not like this?)

647
00:25:40,949 --> 00:25:42,709
(They succeeded in eating eels.)

648
00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:45,079
The texture was something else.

649
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:47,049
- We'll use our chance. - Okay.

650
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,649
- Let's have barbecue. - We'll be on our way.

651
00:25:49,879 --> 00:25:51,809
For today, Haha doesn't exist.

652
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:55,309
I'll forget about myself and spend today just for Ji Hyo,

653
00:25:55,409 --> 00:25:57,079
Sana, and Da Hyun.

654
00:25:58,749 --> 00:26:01,749
I don't care if I don't win for a year as long as I win today.

655
00:26:02,249 --> 00:26:03,379
It's all for these girls.

656
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:06,249
I will give away today for you.

657
00:26:06,249 --> 00:26:08,149
I'll be your servant for the day.

658
00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:10,109
What will happen if we don't win?

659
00:26:10,449 --> 00:26:13,079
Why do we have to fight over this?

660
00:26:13,209 --> 00:26:14,379
You kept at it.

661
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:17,079
- You should've stopped. - I have a family.

662
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,349
It was done, but then you kept at it and I wanted to have the last word.

663
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:22,379
Who is your favorite member in Running Man?

664
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:24,349
Why does he ask this sort of question?

665
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:27,009
- We won't take it personally. - We'll think about something else.

666
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:29,479
Just think of a member you wanted in your team.

667
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:32,949
I'm a fan of Kwang Soo.

668
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:34,549
(He's deeply moved.)

669
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:36,849
I think you might remember. A long time ago,

670
00:26:36,849 --> 00:26:40,479
we met before I made my debut.

671
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:42,209
- We met once, right? - That's right.

672
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:45,749
He was really handsome and he truly looked like a celebrity.

673
00:26:45,749 --> 00:26:48,049
- The Kwang Soo I saw on TV... - He looked stupid on TV.

674
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:50,309
did stupid things and funny dances.

675
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:51,309
(For Ji Hyo, he was a top star.)

676
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,709
I remember thinking to myself how handsome he looked.

677
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:56,279
Personally, I really like...

678
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,779
- Haha. - Hold that thought.

679
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:59,549
I don't think Ji Hyo finished talking.

680
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,679
- Can you wait? - I'm sorry.

681
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:04,779
(Can you not interrupt?)

682
00:27:05,109 --> 00:27:07,479
- You starred in "High Kick!" - They're so nice.

683
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:10,209
- You remember the mosquito dance? - Yes.

684
00:27:10,209 --> 00:27:12,609
- He did it yesterday. - Did you?

685
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:16,009
- My younger sibling likes it a lot. - Really?

686
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:17,979
- One, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four.

687
00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:21,949
- I can't. I'm too embarrassed. - You did it yesterday. Come on.

688
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:23,349
Give him a round of applause.

689
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:24,979
(Please show us your dance.)

690
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,079
A giant mosquito bit my foot

691
00:27:28,209 --> 00:27:29,579
It was very itchy

692
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:31,879
(He regrets deeply.)

693
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,779
(They are satisfied.)

694
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:35,379
I can't believe I saw it with my own eyes.

695
00:27:35,379 --> 00:27:38,649
I haven't done this for ages and I did it two weeks in a row.

696
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:39,749
Next up is Sana.

697
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:43,009
The reason I like Haha is...

698
00:27:43,249 --> 00:27:46,079
because his name is Haha.

699
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,109
Doesn't it sound refreshing?

700
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:50,349
Yes, it does.

701
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:52,109
(Doesn't his name sound refreshing?)

702
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:53,679
(Sana likes Haha because of his name.)

703
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,749
- I'm serious. - Who says something like that?

704
00:27:54,749 --> 00:27:57,279
- You should pick someone else. - This is the real reason.

705
00:27:57,449 --> 00:28:00,109
- I really like your name. - Don't pick on Sana.

706
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:02,209
- Is she serious? Come on. - This is the funniest reason...

707
00:28:02,209 --> 00:28:05,279
- I've heard so far. - Hold on.

708
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,349
- Your name... - So my name sounds refreshing?

709
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:09,679
- Yes, your name sounds refreshing. - I can understand that.

710
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,849
Right, my name is rather hot than refreshing.

711
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:13,609
I didn't mean anything by it.

712
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:17,149
- We've arrived. - This is it. We're here.

713
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:20,609
- Is there a mission? - Is there?

714
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:23,279
We have to get this one by any means.

715
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,909
- Here's your mission. - Okay.

716
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:28,379
The mission for your chance is "Race the VJs".

717
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:30,409
What was that?

718
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:33,079
- What is that... - Before each team's VJ...

719
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:37,379
finishes eating one serving of samgyeopsal,

720
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,509
you need to complete a cross-word puzzle.

721
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:45,349
If they finish eating first, it'll count as a failure.

722
00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:48,909
If you have a misspelling, it'll be counted as a failure as well.

723
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:52,779
If you succeed, you'll receive the One Plus One Card.

724
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:55,349
- Okay, we got it. - Let's start right away.

725
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:57,449
(The VJs get ready to eat.)

726
00:28:57,449 --> 00:28:59,409
Please eat slowly.

727
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:00,409
It's okay to take your time.

728
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:03,349
- Please eat slowly to digest well. - Look at the side dishes.

729
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:05,579
Please chew your food well.

730
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:07,379
I hope you enjoy your food.

731
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,509
She wants you to enjoy your food.

732
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:12,479
- Good food ought to be enjoyed. - You should enjoy good food.

733
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,109
Please cut the meat into small pieces.

734
00:29:15,249 --> 00:29:18,009
Your mission starts now.

735
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:19,409
- Please eat slowly. - Eat slowly, please.

736
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:22,109
- Eat slowly for your digestion. - Please don't eat too fast.

737
00:29:22,109 --> 00:29:24,209
(Their first try has begun.)

738
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:27,249
"What is the string that you use to dry your laundry?"

739
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:29,009
It's clothesline.

740
00:29:29,649 --> 00:29:31,079
"What is the name of piled up rice?"

741
00:29:31,379 --> 00:29:32,579
- Let's solve the second question. - What is the name of the role?

742
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:34,849
"What is the name of piled up rice?"

743
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:37,809
Good food should be enjoyed.

744
00:29:38,379 --> 00:29:42,109
"What is the song Shin Jae Hyo composed during the Joseon Dynasty?"

745
00:29:42,109 --> 00:29:45,379
- It's "The Sound of a Flower". - "The Sound..."

746
00:29:45,449 --> 00:29:46,479
"of a Flower".

747
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:48,549
- Read it quickly. - "What is the part that's stuck..."

748
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:51,679
- "along the thoracic vertebrae?" - Please eat slowly.

749
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:53,879
Ji Hyo sounds a bit angry.

750
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:55,949
- Slow down. - You're eating too fast.

751
00:29:55,949 --> 00:29:58,809
- You eat so fast. - Isn't it hot?

752
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:01,649
- Let's move to the third question. - Please chew your food well.

753
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:03,849
Make sure you taste the food.

754
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:05,779
She wants you to enjoy your food.

755
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:08,849
- You must enjoy good quality food. - You should taste the food well.

756
00:30:08,879 --> 00:30:10,449
Isn't it hot?

757
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,279
Please have some kimchi with it.

758
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:16,509
- You are eating too quickly. - Eat slowly. Hold on.

759
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:18,779
- Let's solve the third question. - Chew slowly.

760
00:30:18,909 --> 00:30:21,849
- Good food ought to be appreciated. - Enjoy your food.

761
00:30:21,949 --> 00:30:23,509
Isn't it hot?

762
00:30:23,709 --> 00:30:26,009
I think you need to cook it a bit more.

763
00:30:26,879 --> 00:30:27,949
What's the 13th question?

764
00:30:27,949 --> 00:30:29,679
(They're about to finish eating.)

765
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:32,009
- What is the number... - You can't be done yet.

766
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:34,079
- What is it? - It's some kind of a password.

767
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,549
Okay. Are you sure?

768
00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:37,509
- What's question number 10? - Don't you want some water?

769
00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:40,079
Stop them from eating, Sana.

770
00:30:40,209 --> 00:30:41,809
(Why are you eating so quickly?)

771
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:44,179
- Don't you want some water? - Is the answer "galbi"?

772
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,009
- No, that's not right. - Aren't you thirsty?

773
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:47,609
Please drink some water.

774
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:48,709
(She secures the last piece of meat.)

775
00:30:49,449 --> 00:30:52,809
(I can't let you have the last piece.)

776
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:55,979
(Can we talk this out?)

777
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,979
"A cool breeze" must mean "wind".

778
00:30:58,049 --> 00:30:59,709
I think so, too.

779
00:30:59,709 --> 00:31:04,079
(It's the War of Samgyeopsal.)

780
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:05,649
It's for row number two.

781
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:08,079
(I can't let you have it.)

782
00:31:08,849 --> 00:31:10,949
I'm sorry, Sana.

783
00:31:11,249 --> 00:31:12,449
Way to go, Sana.

784
00:31:12,449 --> 00:31:14,709
- I'm sorry, Sana. - Give us a bit more time, Sana.

785
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:16,149
(Will she let him take it?)

786
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:20,649
- Is this... - It's Harry Potter.

787
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:22,909
- We're done. - We finished it.

788
00:31:22,909 --> 00:31:25,079
I'm not sure if they're all right, though.

789
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:28,079
Team Haha was...

790
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:30,609
- faster by the slightest amount. - Yes!

791
00:31:30,949 --> 00:31:33,779
We just need all the answers to be correct.

792
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:34,979
Please.

793
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:38,709
(Did they get the answers right?)

794
00:31:38,709 --> 00:31:40,379
- You failed. - Why?

795
00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:42,479
(But why?)

796
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:44,879
- Why? - You misspelled, "clothesline".

797
00:31:44,879 --> 00:31:46,449
You misspelled that, Haha?

798
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:49,549
Haha.

799
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:52,549
You're embarrassing us in front of them.

800
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:54,509
How could you...

801
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:57,749
The VJs must be pretty full by now.

802
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:58,879
Have some water.

803
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:02,809
The water here is really something else.

804
00:32:03,109 --> 00:32:04,649
I'm worried someone else might come here.

805
00:32:04,649 --> 00:32:06,649
We have to do this quickly.

806
00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:08,879
Are we doing the One Plus One Card thing?

807
00:32:09,549 --> 00:32:11,149
(We should strengthen our position with the One Plus One Card.)

808
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:13,249
- Let's do this, Sana. - Okay.

809
00:32:13,249 --> 00:32:14,579
- Let's go. - Let's go.

810
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:20,749
(Slightly full VJs go against Team Haha who can't spell.)

811
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:21,879
- One, two, three. - Let's get started right away.

812
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:23,249
(This is their second attempt.)

813
00:32:23,849 --> 00:32:25,679
(Number 1 across: One of the members of Davichi who was on Running Man)

814
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,949
- It's Kang Min Kyung. - Number one is Kang Min Kyung.

815
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:32,749
(Sana is trying to disturb the VJs.)

816
00:32:34,979 --> 00:32:36,909
You should cut it later.

817
00:32:37,949 --> 00:32:40,279
You should cut it into smaller pieces.

818
00:32:40,379 --> 00:32:43,449
There's no need to rush.

819
00:32:43,449 --> 00:32:45,079
Let me do it.

820
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:48,679
You must be tired from holding up the cameras.

821
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:51,079
I'll do this for you.

822
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:53,909
(Blocking)

823
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:55,949
(Blocking)

824
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:59,249
Not yet.

825
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:00,679
You might get an upset stomach.

826
00:33:01,949 --> 00:33:03,409
(Clanging)

827
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:06,049
(It sounds like a fencing match.)

828
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:08,609
You shouldn't play with your food.

829
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:09,909
(I blocked him.)

830
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:11,609
- What's this one? - Don't.

831
00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:14,079
(There are only three crosswords remaining.)

832
00:33:14,379 --> 00:33:15,609
How many pieces of meat do you have left?

833
00:33:16,509 --> 00:33:18,049
- Four. - Four?

834
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,449
We're almost there.

835
00:33:20,449 --> 00:33:22,379
- What's question number 14? - Eat some kimchi.

836
00:33:22,649 --> 00:33:23,979
We are 500m away from the samgyeopsal restaurant.

837
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:25,949
- There's a road sign. - There must be someone there.

838
00:33:26,209 --> 00:33:27,379
Someone's already there.

839
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:29,249
- No way. - No.

840
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:31,349
No.

841
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:34,509
It's still raw.

842
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:38,349
(Team VJ doesn't mind eating raw pork.)

843
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:39,579
Is it "glutinous potato balls"?

844
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:41,779
- Hold on, Sana. - Glutinous...

845
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:44,479
- potato balls. - Hold on, Sana.

846
00:33:44,479 --> 00:33:47,149
- Let's go over everything. - Apink, Eric Nam, Best Actor Award.

847
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:49,749
(We're almost done, Sana.)

848
00:33:49,749 --> 00:33:50,879
That's the right answer, right?

849
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:52,049
That's right.

850
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:53,879
- He's in that group, right? - We're done.

851
00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:56,679
- We're done. - We finished it.

852
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:58,879
- It's right, isn't it? - Can we not try this mission?

853
00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:00,479
- We're done. - We finished it.

854
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:02,779
Please.

855
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:03,949
(Did they spell everything correctly this time?)

856
00:34:03,949 --> 00:34:05,149
What are you doing here?

857
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,479
- It was really hard. - Please.

858
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:10,119
(Did they spell everything correctly this time?)

859
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:11,579
Team Haha succeeded.

860
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:17,009
(They blocked, they solved, they conquered.)

861
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:23,449
(They receive the One Plus One Card.)

862
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:24,849
Can we not do it now?

863
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:26,679
Eric Nam.

864
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:28,209
We did it.

865
00:34:28,209 --> 00:34:30,479
Why does only one team get to do this mission?

866
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:31,879
We can't do this anymore?

867
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:33,779
- You guys are still hungry, right? - Yes.

868
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:35,549
We should find ourselves a different menu now.

869
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:39,249
- Let's get in the car. - We have the chance card.

870
00:34:39,249 --> 00:34:40,979
- Don't use it on us. - Come on.

871
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:43,879
You guys are leading by a lot.

872
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:47,279
- That's nonsense. - That's not true.

873
00:34:47,279 --> 00:34:48,709
You know I can remove a crossword from your puzzle, right?

874
00:34:48,709 --> 00:34:49,879
I know that.

875
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,979
- Please go easy on us. - We're not leading by a lot.

876
00:34:51,979 --> 00:34:54,009
- You wrote "eel". - What do you think of Kwang Soo?

877
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,249
- He's so handsome. - What?

878
00:34:55,249 --> 00:34:56,879
Hear her out. How do you like Kwang Soo?

879
00:34:57,149 --> 00:34:58,179
What?

880
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,879
- He's very handsome. - He is.

881
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:01,209
You look much better in person.

882
00:35:01,209 --> 00:35:02,909
- Can you take a picture with me? - Kwang Soo.

883
00:35:03,549 --> 00:35:05,249
Get yourself together.

884
00:35:05,249 --> 00:35:06,579
- Can I take a picture with you? - Okay!

885
00:35:07,379 --> 00:35:09,749
- Tell him you love him. - I love you, Kwang Soo!

886
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:11,619
- Oh, my. - I love you!

887
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:13,309
Don't do that. There are people here.

888
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:14,749
- Stop it. - Bye, Kwang Soo.

889
00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:16,479
Stop it.

890
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:17,809
I love you, too.

891
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:21,079
- Don't use your chance card on us! - Don't use your chance card on us!

892
00:35:21,979 --> 00:35:22,979
Of course.

893
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:25,009
- Let's leave this place. - You can trust me.

894
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:27,619
- We love you, Kwang Soo! - We love you, Kwang Soo!

895
00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:29,379
(Do you want my chance card?)

896
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:30,549
Please don't use...

897
00:35:30,549 --> 00:35:32,279
- The chance card! - The chance card!

898
00:35:33,649 --> 00:35:35,379
(I'll do whatever you tell me to.)

899
00:35:35,949 --> 00:35:38,479
- We love you, Ji Hyo! - We love you, Ji Hyo!

900
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:41,209
(Who? Me?)

901
00:35:41,379 --> 00:35:42,909
- What are you talking about? - Please don't use...

902
00:35:42,909 --> 00:35:44,479
- the chance card on us. - The chance card on us!

903
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:47,619
Live a long and happy life, all five of you!

904
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,379
Why are you doing this?

905
00:35:49,379 --> 00:35:51,009
- Stop doing that. - You're making me uncomfortable.

906
00:35:51,009 --> 00:35:52,779
Please don't use it on us.

907
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:56,449
- We have faith in you. - Let's hope he doesn't use it.

908
00:35:56,649 --> 00:35:58,909
I won't forgive him if he uses it after all this.

909
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:01,879
- After everything we did... - If he still attacks us,

910
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:04,009
that'd make him a horrible person.

911
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:06,119
You have to go drink Moonlight coffee now.

912
00:36:06,409 --> 00:36:08,309
- "Moonlight coffee"... - "Is the best".

913
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:09,809
- "Is the best". - "Is the best".

914
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:12,279
We should use the One Plus One Card.

915
00:36:12,979 --> 00:36:14,009
"Is the best".

916
00:36:14,009 --> 00:36:16,649
(They use the One Plus One Card to fill out the red box.)

917
00:36:16,649 --> 00:36:18,149
You have filled out a red box.

918
00:36:18,149 --> 00:36:20,379
You can remove a crossword from someone else's puzzle.

919
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:22,049
Do we have to decide now?

920
00:36:22,979 --> 00:36:25,279
I know we should attack Jae Seok's team,

921
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:29,749
but Na Yeon was...

922
00:36:30,949 --> 00:36:32,409
Did that change your mind?

923
00:36:32,409 --> 00:36:33,949
Not quite.

924
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:37,249
I told you that I'll be devoted to you guys.

925
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:38,649
Then what's stopping you?

926
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:40,549
What are you worried about?

927
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,379
Is your favorite member of Twice in that team?

928
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:45,909
I think it's because they said they loved him.

929
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:48,509
It's been a very long time since anyone said that to me.

930
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:53,209
(They said they loved me.)

931
00:36:53,649 --> 00:36:58,279
(Twice told me so.)

932
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,409
Is your favorite member of Twice in that team?

933
00:37:00,949 --> 00:37:02,909
I think it's because they said they loved him.

934
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,079
Tell him that you love him.

935
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:07,079
- I love you, Kwang Soo. - I love you.

936
00:37:07,479 --> 00:37:08,649
Kwang Soo.

937
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:17,179
(Whom will Kwang Soo choose?)

938
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:19,379
Let's attack them.

939
00:37:19,509 --> 00:37:21,679
It's only right we attack them.

940
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:24,909
- Which one should I go for? - Let's go with that one.

941
00:37:26,749 --> 00:37:28,649
- It's been removed. - What?

942
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,849
- What? - What are you talking about?

943
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:32,879
I think someone removed a crossword from our puzzle.

944
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:34,549
Your puzzle has been updated.

945
00:37:34,549 --> 00:37:35,749
It's been erased.

946
00:37:35,749 --> 00:37:38,619
(Team Haha removed "roasted clams" from their puzzle.)

947
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:40,379
It was Kwang Soo and Haha.

948
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,979
- Gosh. - That's harsh.

949
00:37:43,979 --> 00:37:45,979
They even confessed their love to them.

950
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:48,449
He's a traitor.

951
00:37:49,249 --> 00:37:50,979
- He really is a traitor. - He really is.

952
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:53,579
- He betrayed us. - We should punish him.

953
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:55,679
We'll have revenge on him.

954
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:57,509
This is war.

955
00:37:58,119 --> 00:37:59,379
Is this Eonyang bulgogi?

956
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,649
- It's over there. - This is the place.

957
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:03,849
- It was close by. - We could finish the puzzle here.

958
00:38:04,709 --> 00:38:05,909
Let's do this.

959
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,849
We have to take revenge in the name of justice.

960
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:12,079
- We have to get them back. - They need to learn a lesson.

961
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:14,049
Where is the place?

962
00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:15,119
- It's over there. - There it is.

963
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,209
We should ask for recommendations in front of the restaurant.

964
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:19,509
We have to talk them into it.

965
00:38:19,779 --> 00:38:23,119
"Where can we get some delicious meat around here?"

966
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,749
That's not what we should say.

967
00:38:24,979 --> 00:38:26,209
They might not take the hint.

968
00:38:26,209 --> 00:38:28,909
We should say, "There must be a place around here."

969
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,909
The food looks delicious.

970
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:32,149
(They arrive at a restaurant.)

971
00:38:32,149 --> 00:38:33,409
Someone's coming.

972
00:38:33,409 --> 00:38:34,679
There they come.

973
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:38,649
- Hello. - Hello.

974
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,049
Nice to meet you.

975
00:38:40,049 --> 00:38:41,149
Can we ask you a question?

976
00:38:41,149 --> 00:38:42,349
We were...

977
00:38:42,949 --> 00:38:44,909
feeling a little hungry.

978
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:48,979
We want to ask the people of Busan...

979
00:38:50,209 --> 00:38:53,409
what we should eat.

980
00:38:53,409 --> 00:38:55,649
- Don't rush your answer. - Hold on.

981
00:38:55,649 --> 00:38:56,949
We can't go far from here.

982
00:38:56,949 --> 00:38:59,449
If you name a food,

983
00:38:59,449 --> 00:39:00,979
we have to eat that.

984
00:39:00,979 --> 00:39:02,709
We can't go far from here.

985
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:06,009
- What food... - Busan is famous for...

986
00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:07,949
- a lot of food. - What should we eat?

987
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:14,709
(That's the place we want to go.)

988
00:39:15,209 --> 00:39:18,119
- Eonyang bulgogi. - Eonyang bulgogi.

989
00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:20,049
Eonyang bulgogi.

990
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:22,479
Thank you.

991
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:23,879
Thank you so much.

992
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:25,449
- Thank you. - Eonyang bulgogi.

993
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:27,579
- Thank you so much. - You look skinny.

994
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:29,409
Some bulgogi will help with that.

995
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,909
- Thank you. - Thank you.

996
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:35,579
Let's go.

997
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:37,779
We kind of forced that answer.

998
00:39:38,249 --> 00:39:40,849
When we're finished eating, we shall have our revenge.

999
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:44,179
I'm sorry, but do you think we could get two servings?

1000
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:45,379
Thank you.

1001
00:39:45,379 --> 00:39:47,749
- I've been waiting for this. - "Let's eat some bulgogi."

1002
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,209
"Let's eat some bulgogi."

1003
00:39:49,209 --> 00:39:50,449
After we eat this...

1004
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:51,949
- We should have dessert. - Right.

1005
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,649
"What should we have for dessert?"

1006
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:55,979
- Coffee. - Coffee?

1007
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:57,079
"How about a cup of coffee?"

1008
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:59,209
Then we'll go get our coffee.

1009
00:39:59,779 --> 00:40:02,409
- I'll make them suffer. - Those traitors.

1010
00:40:02,409 --> 00:40:04,179
It's payback time.

1011
00:40:04,379 --> 00:40:06,349
I'll teach them a valuable life lesson.

1012
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:09,379
We should punish them in the name of justice.

1013
00:40:09,779 --> 00:40:11,049
Our food's here.

1014
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:15,049
We're sorry. We wish we could order more, but we have a mission.

1015
00:40:15,049 --> 00:40:17,879
(It's Eonyang bulgogi they've been looking for.)

1016
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:20,409
(Roasting)

1017
00:40:21,649 --> 00:40:23,649
Look at it getting roasted.

1018
00:40:23,649 --> 00:40:25,049
It smells nice.

1019
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:27,709
(They're mesmerized.)

1020
00:40:29,649 --> 00:40:31,779
I love the sound of meat getting cooked.

1021
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:33,549
(Soft and tender bulgogi will motivate them to take revenge.)

1022
00:40:33,649 --> 00:40:34,679
I think it's ready to eat.

1023
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:37,619
(Thank you for the food.)

1024
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:38,649
Let's eat.

1025
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:39,949
Thank you for the food.

1026
00:40:39,949 --> 00:40:41,249
(She takes a big bite.)

1027
00:40:43,879 --> 00:40:44,879
Try some of this.

1028
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:46,949
How does it taste?

1029
00:40:47,249 --> 00:40:48,779
(It's delicious.)

1030
00:40:49,749 --> 00:40:50,749
Isn't it delicious?

1031
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:52,809
(They're impressed by the taste.)

1032
00:40:54,179 --> 00:40:56,449
We worked hard to get here.

1033
00:40:56,449 --> 00:40:59,049
(She eats bulgogi with gusto.)

1034
00:40:59,049 --> 00:41:00,509
It took long for us to get here.

1035
00:41:02,149 --> 00:41:03,209
It's so delicious.

1036
00:41:03,209 --> 00:41:04,849
(Their work was worth it for the bulgogi.)

1037
00:41:04,949 --> 00:41:06,119
It almost melts in the mouth.

1038
00:41:07,649 --> 00:41:10,149
- We do it to win, don't we? - Jeong Yeon knows how to enjoy it.

1039
00:41:10,149 --> 00:41:12,579
Jeong Yeon, you've been so busy with eating.

1040
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:13,749
(Her face is practically attached to her bowl.)

1041
00:41:13,749 --> 00:41:15,509
You haven't lifted your head once.

1042
00:41:16,249 --> 00:41:17,249
(They finish 2 portions in 1 minute.)

1043
00:41:17,249 --> 00:41:19,709
We cleared everything so quickly.

1044
00:41:19,709 --> 00:41:21,809
Didn't you have some pajeon before?

1045
00:41:22,479 --> 00:41:23,509
Didn't you?

1046
00:41:23,509 --> 00:41:25,119
We're the only ones eating so much.

1047
00:41:25,209 --> 00:41:28,379
Jeong Yeon doesn't even look up once when she eats.

1048
00:41:29,149 --> 00:41:30,949
Do you stare at the plate when you eat?

1049
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:32,409
Her face is almost glued to her plate.

1050
00:41:32,749 --> 00:41:33,749
(It's a common eating position for her.)

1051
00:41:33,749 --> 00:41:35,879
- Her face is glued? - Right.

1052
00:41:36,149 --> 00:41:37,479
Her face is glued to her plate.

1053
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,749
(She continues to eat.)

1054
00:41:43,149 --> 00:41:45,249
I heard you slurp, Jeong Yeon.

1055
00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:46,349
Are you happy to eat meat?

1056
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:51,709
(Momo takes meat from the corner.)

1057
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,709
I put some meat on the side.

1058
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:57,649
(It's too delicious to resist.)

1059
00:41:57,949 --> 00:41:58,979
Goodness.

1060
00:42:00,879 --> 00:42:02,749
It's good to see you enjoy it.

1061
00:42:02,749 --> 00:42:04,549
(They take every piece of meat.)

1062
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:06,579
(She eats a lot.)

1063
00:42:06,579 --> 00:42:08,709
People usually don't finish every bite of the meat.

1064
00:42:10,009 --> 00:42:12,709
Momo doesn't care about what we say.

1065
00:42:13,249 --> 00:42:15,409
You stopped talking in the restaurant.

1066
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:17,209
You and Jeong Yeon are impressive.

1067
00:42:17,779 --> 00:42:20,849
She didn't lift her face once when she ate.

1068
00:42:20,849 --> 00:42:23,279
Should we order one more order?

1069
00:42:23,779 --> 00:42:25,309
- That sounds good. - Right?

1070
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,449
- That would be perfect. - May we get one more order?

1071
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:30,209
I think two servings were too little.

1072
00:42:31,509 --> 00:42:33,679
- Here you go. - Did someone attack us again?

1073
00:42:33,749 --> 00:42:35,309
- I brought a lot. - Is that right?

1074
00:42:36,209 --> 00:42:37,579
(Their premonition becomes true.)

1075
00:42:37,579 --> 00:42:38,579
What happened?

1076
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,449
Why do they always attack us?

1077
00:42:41,449 --> 00:42:43,709
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin's team gets attacked.)

1078
00:42:43,709 --> 00:42:46,509
(Which team attacked them?)

1079
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:49,979
Remember One Plus One Card that you earned?

1080
00:42:49,979 --> 00:42:51,249
(It was Haha and Kwang Soo's team again.)

1081
00:42:51,249 --> 00:42:52,749
(They used One Plus One Card and got another chance menu.)

1082
00:42:52,749 --> 00:42:54,119
- What kind of spoon worm? - Spoon worm.

1083
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:55,879
It's Busan spoon worm.

1084
00:42:55,879 --> 00:42:58,309
- We got it. - It's Busan spoon worm.

1085
00:42:58,549 --> 00:42:59,709
We got a chance to attack.

1086
00:42:59,709 --> 00:43:01,119
We have a chance to attack.

1087
00:43:01,149 --> 00:43:02,449
(They attained the chance to attack other team.)

1088
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:04,649
- That's great. - No one can beat us.

1089
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:06,549
Shouldn't we eliminate a team?

1090
00:43:06,549 --> 00:43:08,579
Why don't we attack Jae Seok and Seok Jin?

1091
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:09,619
Eliminate them.

1092
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:11,709
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin's team is attacked again.)

1093
00:43:11,709 --> 00:43:14,209
(Haha and Kwang Soo's team is invincible.)

1094
00:43:15,249 --> 00:43:16,709
(Bulgogi is taken away from them.)

1095
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:18,509
- No way. - I don't understand.

1096
00:43:19,209 --> 00:43:20,649
That's so horrible of them.

1097
00:43:20,649 --> 00:43:21,749
Did we lose bulgogi?

1098
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,009
Did the green team attack us?

1099
00:43:24,249 --> 00:43:25,879
- What's wrong with them? - It was them.

1100
00:43:25,879 --> 00:43:28,349
- They attacked us. - How could they?

1101
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:31,349
- What's Busan spoon worm? - How could they?

1102
00:43:31,449 --> 00:43:33,549
- We have to go this way. - That's right.

1103
00:43:33,549 --> 00:43:36,409
(The red square is the only way to take revenge.)

1104
00:43:36,649 --> 00:43:37,649
Let's eat first.

1105
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:39,049
- Let's eat. - Let's leave after eating.

1106
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:41,979
We should eat a lot when we're stressed.

1107
00:43:42,049 --> 00:43:44,049
Eat some more.

1108
00:43:45,949 --> 00:43:48,349
(Haha and Kwang Soo's team, you just wait and see.)

1109
00:43:48,349 --> 00:43:50,449
We'll show them how terrible life can be.

1110
00:43:50,649 --> 00:43:52,579
Drink up the coffee.

1111
00:43:52,949 --> 00:43:53,949
Cheers.

1112
00:43:54,509 --> 00:43:56,679
Let's win. Yes, yes, yes.

1113
00:43:56,679 --> 00:43:57,979
- Yes, yes, yes. - We've been winning.

1114
00:43:57,979 --> 00:43:58,979
Drink up.

1115
00:43:58,979 --> 00:44:01,409
(Haha and Kwang Soo's team is winning with three menu items.)

1116
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:02,879
(Victory always tastes so sweet.)

1117
00:44:02,879 --> 00:44:04,479
This is a great way to express it.

1118
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:07,709
Everyone, come drink coffee...

1119
00:44:08,149 --> 00:44:09,409
at Dalmaji Cafe.

1120
00:44:09,409 --> 00:44:12,309
(Dalmaji Cafe is like their lucky charm.)

1121
00:44:14,549 --> 00:44:16,509
(Slurping)

1122
00:44:16,979 --> 00:44:18,079
Are you okay?

1123
00:44:18,209 --> 00:44:20,749
Are you pouring out the last drop?

1124
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,049
I finished it in one go.

1125
00:44:22,049 --> 00:44:23,049
Good job.

1126
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:26,079
- Orange juice is good here, too. - She's so cute.

1127
00:44:26,149 --> 00:44:28,709
This is a spot to take photos.

1128
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:29,849
(Let's enjoy some relaxing time.)

1129
00:44:29,849 --> 00:44:31,149
It's so pretty.

1130
00:44:31,149 --> 00:44:33,709
I'm happy because you're so excited.

1131
00:44:33,709 --> 00:44:35,979
I'm happier than ever before.

1132
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:39,249
- I feel great. - I've never been so happy here.

1133
00:44:40,009 --> 00:44:41,979
(They take a photo to capture the moment.)

1134
00:44:43,509 --> 00:44:45,749
(Please let us win.)

1135
00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:48,479
Let's turn around and receive some good energy.

1136
00:44:48,479 --> 00:44:50,179
It's the energy of victory.

1137
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,109
Let's become the winner.

1138
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:54,449
(They receive the energy of victory.)

1139
00:44:54,509 --> 00:44:57,049
Mountain, don't worry

1140
00:44:57,049 --> 00:44:59,749
(Energy from Haeundae may lead them to victory.)

1141
00:44:59,749 --> 00:45:00,949
- That was great. - Good job.

1142
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:02,949
- It'll make a good memory. - I know.

1143
00:45:02,979 --> 00:45:04,149
Let's take revenge.

1144
00:45:04,149 --> 00:45:05,979
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you.

1145
00:45:06,049 --> 00:45:07,949
- Let's go now. - It's the cafe street.

1146
00:45:07,949 --> 00:45:09,309
Here's Dalmaji Cafe.

1147
00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:11,549
I want to eat ice cream here.

1148
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:13,609
- Here it is. - Cake sounds good, too.

1149
00:45:13,609 --> 00:45:15,349
- Cake? - Wouldn't cake be delicious, too?

1150
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:16,849
- Yes. - Let's get cake.

1151
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:18,349
- There are cookies. - They have homemade cakes.

1152
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:19,409
Let's eat here.

1153
00:45:20,249 --> 00:45:23,509
We should to talk to someone here.

1154
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,679
Excuse me. May I ask you a question?

1155
00:45:27,249 --> 00:45:28,379
(Gosh! It's Twice!)

1156
00:45:28,879 --> 00:45:31,109
Could we talk to you for a minute?

1157
00:45:31,109 --> 00:45:32,249
Sure.

1158
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:35,409
- We just had some food. - What a surprise.

1159
00:45:36,049 --> 00:45:38,509
We feel quite heavy because the food was greasy.

1160
00:45:38,549 --> 00:45:41,249
Wait a minute. Please take your time.

1161
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:43,549
If you recommend a place, we must go there.

1162
00:45:43,549 --> 00:45:45,849
- Is that so? - We're very full.

1163
00:45:46,349 --> 00:45:49,009
We want to eat something sweet.

1164
00:45:49,749 --> 00:45:52,049
(They make a gesture as a hint.)

1165
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,879
(Slurping?)

1166
00:45:53,879 --> 00:45:54,879
(Should I say it or not?)

1167
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:57,879
Wait a minute, please.

1168
00:45:57,879 --> 00:46:00,709
I think he got the wrong hint and misunderstood.

1169
00:46:00,709 --> 00:46:02,149
(He may have misunderstood.)

1170
00:46:02,149 --> 00:46:03,879
(Isn't that it?)

1171
00:46:03,879 --> 00:46:05,109
What do you recommend?

1172
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:06,309
Around this time...

1173
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:08,149
- Please don't say it yet. - Is your nose bleeding, Na Yeon?

1174
00:46:08,149 --> 00:46:11,109
- Be careful. - Her nose is bleeding.

1175
00:46:11,649 --> 00:46:13,249
(It's their second gesture hint.)

1176
00:46:13,249 --> 00:46:14,649
Oh, I see.

1177
00:46:14,879 --> 00:46:16,209
You should get some coffee.

1178
00:46:16,209 --> 00:46:19,109
(You should get some coffee.)

1179
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,109
Was that correct?

1180
00:46:20,109 --> 00:46:21,109
(He becomes their hero.)

1181
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:22,809
He knows exactly what we need.

1182
00:46:23,549 --> 00:46:25,679
When I made this gesture, I was afraid that he misunderstood.

1183
00:46:25,779 --> 00:46:27,249
He thought we meant alcohol.

1184
00:46:27,249 --> 00:46:28,709
I'm glad you didn't say soju.

1185
00:46:28,709 --> 00:46:30,209
We'll take your advice and have some coffee.

1186
00:46:30,209 --> 00:46:31,409
- Sure. - Thank you.

1187
00:46:31,409 --> 00:46:33,409
- Thank you. - Goodbye.

1188
00:46:33,709 --> 00:46:35,749
(Aromatic coffee is best after a heavy meal.)

1189
00:46:35,749 --> 00:46:36,749
The machine is running.

1190
00:46:37,479 --> 00:46:38,849
- It smells good. - Hello.

1191
00:46:38,949 --> 00:46:40,679
Do you grind coffee beans here?

1192
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:41,749
Hello.

1193
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:44,209
- Let's see. - Please give us a pen.

1194
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:47,249
- We can finally erase it. - Finally.

1195
00:46:47,249 --> 00:46:48,949
(They fill in the crossword puzzle.)

1196
00:46:48,949 --> 00:46:50,909
- Coffee. - Coffee Bravo.

1197
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:52,749
What should we erase?

1198
00:46:53,209 --> 00:46:54,209
Shall we erase it?

1199
00:46:54,209 --> 00:46:55,209
(They attack Haha and Kwang Soo's team.)

1200
00:46:55,209 --> 00:46:56,249
We'll erase gukbap.

1201
00:46:56,279 --> 00:46:57,549
(They attack Kwang Soo and Haha right away.)

1202
00:46:57,709 --> 00:46:59,209
We need to erase one.

1203
00:46:59,209 --> 00:47:01,109
(We won't let them win.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1204
00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:05,849
(Kwang Soo gets a call.)

1205
00:47:05,849 --> 00:47:06,879
Hello, Jae Seok.

1206
00:47:07,949 --> 00:47:09,309
Kwang Soo.

1207
00:47:09,309 --> 00:47:10,949
- Who is it? - Who's calling?

1208
00:47:10,949 --> 00:47:12,849
- This is Na Yeon. - Hello, Na Yeon.

1209
00:47:13,649 --> 00:47:16,509
I really liked you.

1210
00:47:16,549 --> 00:47:18,049
Na Yeon, listen to me.

1211
00:47:18,509 --> 00:47:20,249
After what you've done...

1212
00:47:20,249 --> 00:47:23,049
To tell you the truth, I wanted to attack the black team.

1213
00:47:24,249 --> 00:47:26,179
- What are you talking about? - Listen to me.

1214
00:47:26,949 --> 00:47:28,509
It's over between us.

1215
00:47:28,709 --> 00:47:29,849
Let's talk in person later.

1216
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:31,609
(He already lost his trust.)

1217
00:47:31,609 --> 00:47:33,649
- Na Yeon, we should meet. - Na Yeon.

1218
00:47:33,649 --> 00:47:36,079
I'm hanging up. It's a war between us now.

1219
00:47:36,249 --> 00:47:38,379
- Come on, Jae Seok. - We love you.

1220
00:47:38,409 --> 00:47:39,749
We love you.

1221
00:47:39,749 --> 00:47:42,109
- We love you. - We love you.

1222
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,849
I'm sorry, but it's a war...

1223
00:47:44,849 --> 00:47:46,379
- between us. - It's a war.

1224
00:47:46,779 --> 00:47:48,649
They're declaring a war against us.

1225
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:51,079
Let's take our chance.

1226
00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:54,849
Do we have 2 items? Most teams have 2.

1227
00:47:54,849 --> 00:47:55,949
(Current status of Crossword Puzzle)

1228
00:47:56,409 --> 00:47:57,679
I don't think this is it.

1229
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:00,149
(Here's what's going on with Jong Kook and Ji Hyo's team.)

1230
00:48:00,149 --> 00:48:02,049
- There it is. - This is the place.

1231
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:04,109
"How far have you gone inside Gukje Market?"

1232
00:48:04,309 --> 00:48:06,909
- Is it on the second floor? - Do we go upstairs?

1233
00:48:07,149 --> 00:48:08,849
- Please go upstairs. - What's going on here?

1234
00:48:09,749 --> 00:48:12,049
The chance mission at Gukje Market...

1235
00:48:12,349 --> 00:48:14,349
which has a variety of items...

1236
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,149
is called "One in a Million".

1237
00:48:16,249 --> 00:48:18,279
Wasn't that mentioned before?

1238
00:48:18,679 --> 00:48:21,749
Five members on the team will run to the market in a relay.

1239
00:48:21,749 --> 00:48:24,609
They must buy five items that would fit...

1240
00:48:24,609 --> 00:48:26,149
in the Crossword Puzzle.

1241
00:48:26,249 --> 00:48:27,849
If you succeed, you get a chance.

1242
00:48:27,849 --> 00:48:29,449
(He thinks of choosing between a hat, gloves, and flowers.)

1243
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:31,649
I'll find fabric with a floral print.

1244
00:48:31,949 --> 00:48:34,009
This is great.

1245
00:48:34,479 --> 00:48:36,749
Could you give me just a little?

1246
00:48:36,879 --> 00:48:40,249
I brought fabric with a floral print, Gukje Market's specialty.

1247
00:48:40,249 --> 00:48:41,249
Mini flowers.

1248
00:48:42,049 --> 00:48:43,279
I think this is good.

1249
00:48:43,749 --> 00:48:44,749
Jangjoah.

1250
00:48:45,849 --> 00:48:47,009
It's "Jangjoah Coffee".

1251
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:48,649
What's wrong with that?

1252
00:48:48,649 --> 00:48:51,509
Jangjoah Coffee is good for the stomach.

1253
00:48:51,509 --> 00:48:53,749
May I get one Jangjoah Coffee?

1254
00:48:54,049 --> 00:48:55,779
This can be "Korean walnut cookie".

1255
00:48:55,779 --> 00:48:58,109
- Let's get some walnut cookies. - Let's go.

1256
00:48:58,249 --> 00:49:00,409
Tzuyu, make a left turn around the corner.

1257
00:49:00,409 --> 00:49:01,449
Okay.

1258
00:49:01,649 --> 00:49:05,949
I heard hanbok is very expensive.

1259
00:49:05,949 --> 00:49:07,309
Is it cheap?

1260
00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:08,679
(She got her attention.)

1261
00:49:10,009 --> 00:49:11,779
Welcome, try a walnut cookie.

1262
00:49:11,779 --> 00:49:12,949
(Here's what she's looking for.)

1263
00:49:13,479 --> 00:49:15,109
- Okay. - Welcome.

1264
00:49:15,109 --> 00:49:17,349
(She walks away from walnut cookies.)

1265
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:19,749
Why are they displayed like this?

1266
00:49:20,649 --> 00:49:23,509
Is it so that you can choose...

1267
00:49:23,609 --> 00:49:25,809
the fabric for your hanbok?

1268
00:49:26,309 --> 00:49:27,309
Tzuyu.

1269
00:49:27,309 --> 00:49:28,609
(Tzuyu, where are you?)

1270
00:49:28,609 --> 00:49:29,609
Did someone stop her?

1271
00:49:29,709 --> 00:49:30,949
Is she giving someone her autograph?

1272
00:49:31,249 --> 00:49:32,979
Why isn't she back yet?

1273
00:49:32,979 --> 00:49:34,909
The blankets look so warm.

1274
00:49:35,149 --> 00:49:38,649
All the fabric is so soft.

1275
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:42,949
(She takes a cup of tea while shopping.)

1276
00:49:42,949 --> 00:49:45,209
(She falls in love with Korean markets.)

1277
00:49:45,209 --> 00:49:46,309
It's delicious.

1278
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:48,679
Tzuyu.

1279
00:49:49,579 --> 00:49:52,049
(How far did you go to buy walnut cookies?)

1280
00:49:52,049 --> 00:49:54,309
- Tzuyu. - Where is she?

1281
00:49:54,549 --> 00:49:56,449
- Is she a spy? - What if she is?

1282
00:49:56,449 --> 00:49:58,609
The shop is right around the corner.

1283
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:01,209
- I can't believe it. - Where did she go?

1284
00:50:01,209 --> 00:50:02,609
I wonder where she went.

1285
00:50:03,409 --> 00:50:06,509
- Tzuyu, where have you been? - Where have you been?

1286
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:08,609
Did you buy the walnut cookies?

1287
00:50:08,949 --> 00:50:10,979
- Here. - Do you know what they are?

1288
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:12,749
She bought something else.

1289
00:50:12,749 --> 00:50:15,579
No, I bought some sweet potatoes.

1290
00:50:15,949 --> 00:50:19,249
- I bought some sweet potatoes... - What?

1291
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:20,749
and walnut cookies.

1292
00:50:20,749 --> 00:50:21,979
Did you buy them?

1293
00:50:21,979 --> 00:50:23,409
- Did you buy walnut cookies? - She did.

1294
00:50:24,449 --> 00:50:25,449
(She realized what her mission was.)

1295
00:50:25,449 --> 00:50:26,879
There are two types of walnut cookies.

1296
00:50:26,879 --> 00:50:29,449
This is the original, and this is sweet potato-flavored.

1297
00:50:29,449 --> 00:50:31,049
- Sweet potato? - Yes.

1298
00:50:31,049 --> 00:50:32,049
- Really? - Yes.

1299
00:50:32,379 --> 00:50:33,479
Let me try it.

1300
00:50:33,479 --> 00:50:35,309
(She even tries a sample.)

1301
00:50:35,309 --> 00:50:36,309
Is it good?

1302
00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:37,779
(She tries a sample.)

1303
00:50:37,879 --> 00:50:38,949
It's in her hand.

1304
00:50:38,949 --> 00:50:40,809
I thought we lost you.

1305
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:43,009
- Are you a spy? - Are you?

1306
00:50:43,209 --> 00:50:44,809
I'm not.

1307
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:46,879
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo's team clears their mission.)

1308
00:50:46,879 --> 00:50:47,949
We got it.

1309
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:49,479
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo's team clears their mission.)

1310
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:50,549
Okay.

1311
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:53,309
(They get to write any dish they want.)

1312
00:50:53,309 --> 00:50:55,709
(One Plus One Card)

1313
00:50:56,109 --> 00:50:57,509
(Next team to arrive at Gukje Market is...)

1314
00:50:57,509 --> 00:50:59,809
Nobody's here, yet. What's this?

1315
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:01,579
(Haha and Kwang Soo's team arrives at Gukje Market in second place.)

1316
00:51:01,579 --> 00:51:04,249
(They have to use the crossword the previous team used.)

1317
00:51:04,309 --> 00:51:05,649
We can't attack.

1318
00:51:05,649 --> 00:51:06,779
We can't.

1319
00:51:07,209 --> 00:51:08,779
We've been too nice.

1320
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:11,579
- Look. - "King crab"?

1321
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:14,349
They have two, right?

1322
00:51:14,349 --> 00:51:15,909
- It's four! - It is?

1323
00:51:17,109 --> 00:51:20,009
(They already have four?)

1324
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,549
Is there something you want to recommend?

1325
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:23,949
- Fish cake. - Fish cake?

1326
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:25,409
Thank you.

1327
00:51:25,409 --> 00:51:27,109
Thank you for the food.

1328
00:51:27,109 --> 00:51:28,979
- I'm not big, right? - It's tasty.

1329
00:51:29,309 --> 00:51:31,509
I'm not really big.

1330
00:51:31,509 --> 00:51:33,609
Can you recommend one dish?

1331
00:51:33,609 --> 00:51:35,149
- King crab. - King crab?

1332
00:51:35,979 --> 00:51:37,849
Let's have king crab.

1333
00:51:37,849 --> 00:51:38,849
(It's good but they're running out of time.)

1334
00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:40,179
It's huge.

1335
00:51:40,179 --> 00:51:44,549
(They're clearing four dishes if they finish king crab as well.)

1336
00:51:44,879 --> 00:51:46,509
They also have One Plus One Card.

1337
00:51:46,949 --> 00:51:49,309
- Who does? - They have four.

1338
00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:51,179
(When did they get so many?)

1339
00:51:51,179 --> 00:51:52,879
- They only have one left. - Right.

1340
00:51:52,879 --> 00:51:54,549
This always happens...

1341
00:51:54,549 --> 00:51:57,279
but when we compete with Kwang Soo's team,

1342
00:51:57,479 --> 00:52:00,549
- Jong Kook always gets ahead. - He wins by default.

1343
00:52:01,279 --> 00:52:02,879
What about "pretty hats"?

1344
00:52:02,879 --> 00:52:05,049
- Sure. - That's a good one.

1345
00:52:05,049 --> 00:52:06,649
- Let's go. - See you later.

1346
00:52:06,649 --> 00:52:08,379
- Hurry, Da Hyun. - Sure.

1347
00:52:08,879 --> 00:52:10,479
(They are looking for hats.)

1348
00:52:10,479 --> 00:52:11,679
Do you sell hats?

1349
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:13,309
Yes, I can use a handkerchief...

1350
00:52:13,309 --> 00:52:16,409
and make a hat.

1351
00:52:16,449 --> 00:52:17,979
Is it called a bandana hat?

1352
00:52:17,979 --> 00:52:19,679
Sure. It goes around like this.

1353
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:21,909
- Did you get a hat? - It's a different kind of hat...

1354
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:23,449
- so it works. - They do sell hats here.

1355
00:52:23,449 --> 00:52:25,079
- Hurry up. Who's next? - It's Sana.

1356
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:27,109
You can get anything. Get anything.

1357
00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:28,409
- We can make up a word. - Get anything.

1358
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:30,949
Anything? What should I get?

1359
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:34,449
(She steps foot into the market where Tzuyu couldn't get out of.)

1360
00:52:34,449 --> 00:52:36,749
(Will Sana be able to navigate herself?)

1361
00:52:36,749 --> 00:52:37,749
Where's Sana going?

1362
00:52:37,749 --> 00:52:39,349
- Hurry, Sana! - Hurry up, Sana!

1363
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:41,179
- We don't have time. - Where is she going? Sana?

1364
00:52:41,409 --> 00:52:43,549
She's a bit slow.

1365
00:52:43,549 --> 00:52:45,879
- Where did she go? - Isn't she a bit slow?

1366
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,309
Let's look around later, Sana.

1367
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:49,809
Sana?

1368
00:52:49,809 --> 00:52:52,279
- What starts with tofu? - Tofu?

1369
00:52:52,279 --> 00:52:54,709
"Du". What starts with "Du"?

1370
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:56,149
(She asks the vendors.)

1371
00:52:56,149 --> 00:52:58,549
What starts with "Du"?

1372
00:52:58,549 --> 00:52:59,749
Bandanas.

1373
00:52:59,749 --> 00:53:01,549
What starts with "Du"?

1374
00:53:01,609 --> 00:53:02,749
- Bandanas. - Bandanas.

1375
00:53:02,749 --> 00:53:04,279
Durumagi.

1376
00:53:04,479 --> 00:53:06,249
Durumagi? What's that?

1377
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:08,409
- Durumagi is for hanbok. - Durumagi?

1378
00:53:08,409 --> 00:53:10,549
How much is it?

1379
00:53:10,549 --> 00:53:12,449
- It's expensive. - Is it?

1380
00:53:12,549 --> 00:53:14,879
- I'll give you a cheaper one. - How much is it?

1381
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:17,309
- What's the cheapest? - The cheapest? It's 10 dollars.

1382
00:53:17,309 --> 00:53:18,349
10 dollars?

1383
00:53:18,349 --> 00:53:20,949
We only have 30 dollars in total.

1384
00:53:20,979 --> 00:53:23,109
Can you make it five dollars?

1385
00:53:23,109 --> 00:53:25,509
(Can you make it five dollars?)

1386
00:53:25,509 --> 00:53:28,279
(She acts cute in front of the vendors.)

1387
00:53:28,279 --> 00:53:29,949
- I'll give it to you for five. - Really?

1388
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:31,979
Thank you.

1389
00:53:32,749 --> 00:53:36,009
Thank you. Thank you.

1390
00:53:36,749 --> 00:53:39,109
(She's happy.)

1391
00:53:40,909 --> 00:53:43,149
- Sana's back. What is it? - It's durumagi.

1392
00:53:43,309 --> 00:53:44,579
I got durumagi.

1393
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:45,809
- Durumagi? - Durumagi.

1394
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:47,779
- Yes! - That's amazing.

1395
00:53:48,379 --> 00:53:49,579
- Durumagi. - Durumagi.

1396
00:53:49,579 --> 00:53:51,109
Durumagi.

1397
00:53:51,879 --> 00:53:54,179
Hello. I'm looking for gloves.

1398
00:53:54,179 --> 00:53:56,109
Men's gloves?

1399
00:53:56,109 --> 00:53:57,409
Do you have gloves?

1400
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,209
Do cotton gloves work?

1401
00:53:59,409 --> 00:54:01,809
They do. Cotton gloves work!

1402
00:54:01,949 --> 00:54:03,349
Thank you. How much is it?

1403
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:04,879
- It's free. - No, please take a dollar at least.

1404
00:54:04,879 --> 00:54:07,449
- Sure. - Thank you, Madam.

1405
00:54:07,549 --> 00:54:09,049
- I'll get cake. - You're next.

1406
00:54:09,049 --> 00:54:10,909
- I'll get cake. - It's right there.

1407
00:54:11,009 --> 00:54:13,949
- Already? - Thank you. What's it called?

1408
00:54:13,949 --> 00:54:15,079
How are you going to name it?

1409
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:18,249
- "Very tasty cake". - "Tasty cake"?

1410
00:54:18,249 --> 00:54:20,149
- I don't know if this would work. - What is it?

1411
00:54:20,379 --> 00:54:21,979
- What's that? - Sit down.

1412
00:54:21,979 --> 00:54:23,349
(Why did he get this?)

1413
00:54:23,349 --> 00:54:26,709
- What's this? - "Fake flowers".

1414
00:54:27,179 --> 00:54:28,609
(I guess that works.)

1415
00:54:28,609 --> 00:54:30,009
This should work.

1416
00:54:30,109 --> 00:54:31,179
Approved.

1417
00:54:32,109 --> 00:54:33,209
Good job.

1418
00:54:33,209 --> 00:54:36,049
(Haha and Kwang Soo's team clears the mission.)

1419
00:54:36,049 --> 00:54:37,179
Can we leave?

1420
00:54:37,179 --> 00:54:38,909
Can we ask the waitress for the next menu?

1421
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:40,309
Should we?

1422
00:54:40,709 --> 00:54:42,149
We...

1423
00:54:42,149 --> 00:54:44,149
We would like to stay in Gukje Market...

1424
00:54:44,509 --> 00:54:45,749
and tour Busan.

1425
00:54:45,779 --> 00:54:48,779
- What food reminds you of Busan? - What reminds you of Busan?

1426
00:54:49,379 --> 00:54:51,879
If we stay in the market,

1427
00:54:51,979 --> 00:54:55,009
- we have a good chance. - That's right.

1428
00:54:55,009 --> 00:54:57,709
- What food reminds you of Busan? - What reminds you of Busan?

1429
00:54:57,709 --> 00:54:58,749
Wheat noodles.

1430
00:54:59,909 --> 00:55:00,909
(Wheat noodles)

1431
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,279
She said wheat noodles first.

1432
00:55:04,279 --> 00:55:05,479
Do they sell wheat noodles in the market?

1433
00:55:06,349 --> 00:55:09,279
Do they sell it? I think you have to walk a bit.

1434
00:55:09,649 --> 00:55:11,179
(Well)

1435
00:55:11,179 --> 00:55:13,349
We'll ask for real now.

1436
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:14,679
The three of them spoke at once.

1437
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:17,779
- I'm sorry but I asked her. - We're sorry.

1438
00:55:17,779 --> 00:55:18,979
Why did you answer for her?

1439
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,509
Excuse me. Why did you get in the way?

1440
00:55:20,749 --> 00:55:22,379
I admit the cake is good, but...

1441
00:55:22,909 --> 00:55:25,249
This is your last chance. We'll go with what they say.

1442
00:55:25,249 --> 00:55:26,309
(They get another chance to ask the question.)

1443
00:55:26,309 --> 00:55:28,509
- What food reminds you of Busan? - What reminds you of Busan?

1444
00:55:28,649 --> 00:55:30,979
(What food reminds you of Busan?)

1445
00:55:31,649 --> 00:55:33,379
Wheat noodles.

1446
00:55:33,479 --> 00:55:34,979
(Busan is known for their wheat noodles.)

1447
00:55:34,979 --> 00:55:37,349
- Let's go with wheat noodles. - But you...

1448
00:55:37,449 --> 00:55:38,649
Let's get going.

1449
00:55:38,649 --> 00:55:39,779
(You have to try wheat noodles here.)

1450
00:55:39,779 --> 00:55:42,579
- Let's hurry. - Do they have wheat noodles here?

1451
00:55:43,349 --> 00:55:45,409
- Do they have wheat noodles here? - Let's get going.

1452
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,909
- Let's go. - Thank you.

1453
00:55:47,909 --> 00:55:49,479
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1454
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:50,849
(Thank you for recommending wheat noodles.)

1455
00:55:50,979 --> 00:55:52,279
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo's team is still on king crab.)

1456
00:55:52,279 --> 00:55:53,479
Don't we have another chance?

1457
00:55:53,479 --> 00:55:57,009
While the other two teams were competing with each other...

1458
00:55:57,079 --> 00:55:59,509
- We took over. - We did.

1459
00:55:59,949 --> 00:56:01,949
We can't go without having king crab.

1460
00:56:01,949 --> 00:56:03,379
Who thought of this, by the way?

1461
00:56:03,379 --> 00:56:04,479
Do you like crabs?

1462
00:56:04,479 --> 00:56:06,909
(They even get to try king crab.)

1463
00:56:09,009 --> 00:56:12,349
It's taking a while though.

1464
00:56:12,649 --> 00:56:13,949
They have to steam it.

1465
00:56:14,379 --> 00:56:16,679
It takes around 25 minutes.

1466
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:19,709
- Sorry? - That's the shortest it takes.

1467
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,309
It might take longer.

1468
00:56:21,309 --> 00:56:23,409
(We have to wait 25 minutes?)

1469
00:56:25,009 --> 00:56:28,049
(The other 2 teams cleared 2 dishes each.)

1470
00:56:28,049 --> 00:56:29,709
They have everything here.

1471
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:31,079
Excuse me.

1472
00:56:31,809 --> 00:56:33,879
Do you sell crock pots?

1473
00:56:33,879 --> 00:56:35,609
Where did he go?

1474
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:36,909
He can get anything.

1475
00:56:37,209 --> 00:56:39,279
- Hello. - Hello.

1476
00:56:39,279 --> 00:56:40,709
(Haha and Kwang Soo's team arrives at the wheat noodles place.)

1477
00:56:40,709 --> 00:56:43,349
Can we have wheat noodles? It doesn't take long, right?

1478
00:56:43,349 --> 00:56:45,249
We'll eat quick. We'll take five minutes.

1479
00:56:45,349 --> 00:56:47,309
"Only wheat noodles".

1480
00:56:47,649 --> 00:56:50,009
"Only wheat noodles"? We can do another one, right?

1481
00:56:50,609 --> 00:56:52,509
(They have One Plus One Card.)

1482
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:54,409
"Let's eat hotteok. All right."

1483
00:56:54,449 --> 00:56:55,479
- All right. - That works, right?

1484
00:56:55,479 --> 00:56:57,409
- All right. - All right!

1485
00:56:57,609 --> 00:56:59,379
"All right"? That works.

1486
00:56:59,379 --> 00:57:00,849
(Am I weird for not knowing this?)

1487
00:57:01,249 --> 00:57:03,379
(They finally completed four dishes.)

1488
00:57:04,349 --> 00:57:05,379
It's here.

1489
00:57:06,579 --> 00:57:07,649
It's here.

1490
00:57:07,649 --> 00:57:09,479
(King crab is finally here.)

1491
00:57:09,949 --> 00:57:11,109
It's huge.

1492
00:57:11,109 --> 00:57:12,679
- It's as big as me. - Thank you.

1493
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,779
(We only have one left after this.)

1494
00:57:13,779 --> 00:57:15,709
You're rolling up your sleeves so that you can eat a lot, right?

1495
00:57:15,709 --> 00:57:16,749
(Twice is eating all they want.)

1496
00:57:16,749 --> 00:57:18,549
They don't know how to crack it open.

1497
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:20,449
How nice of you.

1498
00:57:20,449 --> 00:57:21,509
(They didn't say a word for 30 minutes.)

1499
00:57:21,509 --> 00:57:23,179
We need to speed up.

1500
00:57:23,409 --> 00:57:24,549
"Delicious bread".

1501
00:57:24,549 --> 00:57:26,709
(If Jae Seok's team uses One Plus One Card, they'll have 4 as well.)

1502
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:29,049
- "Rose petal tea". - "Rose petal tea".

1503
00:57:29,349 --> 00:57:30,749
- Let's use it. - You can use it.

1504
00:57:30,749 --> 00:57:32,779
We're done, then.

1505
00:57:33,309 --> 00:57:35,509
(They have 2. Haha's team is working on their 4th dish.)

1506
00:57:36,249 --> 00:57:38,179
(They move their chopsticks fast.)

1507
00:57:38,179 --> 00:57:40,009
- Attack it, guys. - Eat.

1508
00:57:40,009 --> 00:57:41,109
Attack!

1509
00:57:41,509 --> 00:57:43,049
We have no time.

1510
00:57:43,049 --> 00:57:44,879
(Jong Kook's team is ahead of them and Jae Seok's team trails them.)

1511
00:57:44,879 --> 00:57:49,209
(Once they finish the wheat noodles, they only have one left.)

1512
00:57:49,209 --> 00:57:53,579
(Once they finish the wheat noodles, they only have one left.)

1513
00:57:53,779 --> 00:57:55,249
Try some spicy wheat noodles.

1514
00:57:55,249 --> 00:57:56,709
No, Sir. We are good with one.

1515
00:57:56,749 --> 00:57:58,249
(No, Sir.)

1516
00:57:58,849 --> 00:57:59,909
No, Sir.

1517
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:03,609
(People in Busan are just so generous.)

1518
00:58:03,609 --> 00:58:05,479
- Just try some. - You're so kind.

1519
00:58:07,179 --> 00:58:08,809
Cut it up. Quick.

1520
00:58:11,509 --> 00:58:13,079
- This is great. - This is really good.

1521
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:14,079
This is spicy wheat noodles.

1522
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:15,509
It's good.

1523
00:58:15,509 --> 00:58:16,879
Okay. That's enough.

1524
00:58:16,879 --> 00:58:18,579
(Twice looks like they're on "Baek Jong Won's Top 3 Chef King".)

1525
00:58:19,949 --> 00:58:22,149
It tastes different.

1526
00:58:22,149 --> 00:58:23,949
(It's time for the last dish.)

1527
00:58:24,349 --> 00:58:25,749
It's okay!

1528
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:29,249
(Hold on, please.)

1529
00:58:29,279 --> 00:58:30,779
Have one each.

1530
00:58:30,879 --> 00:58:32,509
It's okay!

1531
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:33,809
Have one each.

1532
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,609
(They're all impressed by the generous Busan people.)

1533
00:58:35,609 --> 00:58:37,979
- Thank you. - Thank you very much.

1534
00:58:38,109 --> 00:58:40,349
- I should sit back down. - It's tasty.

1535
00:58:40,349 --> 00:58:42,509
(They came for wheat noodles and they're having a course meal.)

1536
00:58:42,609 --> 00:58:43,649
Attack!

1537
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:45,409
We have no time, guys.

1538
00:58:45,409 --> 00:58:47,649
(They only have one left to go.)

1539
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:48,649
- Madam. - Yes.

1540
00:58:49,309 --> 00:58:51,749
Besides from wheat noodles, is there anything nearby...

1541
00:58:53,349 --> 00:58:56,279
that is famous in Busan?

1542
00:58:56,679 --> 00:58:59,709
(Her answer will decide their fate in the race.)

1543
00:58:59,709 --> 00:59:02,479
(Can we have something simple to eat?)

1544
00:59:03,279 --> 00:59:04,649
- Seed-filled hotteok? - Pork gukbap.

1545
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:06,049
- Seed-filled hotteok? - Pork gukbap.

1546
00:59:06,049 --> 00:59:07,809
What did you say? Did you say hotteok?

1547
00:59:07,809 --> 00:59:09,679
(That is simple to eat.)

1548
00:59:09,909 --> 00:59:11,649
What did you say? Did you say hotteok?

1549
00:59:11,809 --> 00:59:14,409
She said hotteok!

1550
00:59:14,609 --> 00:59:16,609
- It's close by. - Is it close?

1551
00:59:17,049 --> 00:59:18,309
Let's go quick.

1552
00:59:18,309 --> 00:59:20,509
- Is it across? - We...

1553
00:59:20,809 --> 00:59:23,809
We would like you to recommend something simple we can eat.

1554
00:59:23,809 --> 00:59:24,979
- Coffee? - Coffee?

1555
00:59:24,979 --> 00:59:26,809
Thank you.

1556
00:59:26,809 --> 00:59:28,209
Thank you.

1557
00:59:28,209 --> 00:59:29,579
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1558
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:32,009
Let's get coffee here.

1559
00:59:32,109 --> 00:59:33,249
They sell seed-filled hotteok here.

1560
00:59:33,249 --> 00:59:35,949
It's here. Okay.

1561
00:59:35,949 --> 00:59:36,979
It's here!

1562
00:59:36,979 --> 00:59:39,679
They have seed-filled hotteok. Where's the board?

1563
00:59:40,049 --> 00:59:43,009
"Are you eating hotteok by yourself?"

1564
00:59:43,309 --> 00:59:44,779
"I'm mad."

1565
00:59:44,779 --> 00:59:45,949
(He invents a new menu.)

1566
00:59:45,979 --> 00:59:49,779
- "I'm mad." - "I'm mad."

1567
00:59:50,179 --> 00:59:51,179
(Isn't that perfect?)

1568
00:59:51,179 --> 00:59:52,349
- It's cute. - Approved.

1569
00:59:53,949 --> 00:59:56,209
(It's hotteok party.)

1570
00:59:56,779 --> 00:59:58,649
- Is it good? - Can I have one? Thank you.

1571
00:59:58,649 --> 01:00:00,379
You have to whisper after you swallow.

1572
01:00:02,709 --> 01:00:04,909
(It's only Kwang Soo left.)

1573
01:00:04,909 --> 01:00:06,109
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo.

1574
01:00:06,109 --> 01:00:07,679
Hurry!

1575
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:10,179
(Please hurry.)

1576
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:12,179
- We... - Can we have five cups of coffee?

1577
01:00:12,179 --> 01:00:13,509
All right.

1578
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:15,279
We have filled in five menus.

1579
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:16,449
We have.

1580
01:00:16,649 --> 01:00:19,549
(Both teams are almost done.)

1581
01:00:19,779 --> 01:00:23,849
(Which team will clear their last menu first?)

1582
01:00:24,309 --> 01:00:26,049
(Whistling)

1583
01:00:26,049 --> 01:00:27,079
Clear.

1584
01:00:27,149 --> 01:00:28,149
(Haha and Kwang Soo's team is done.)

1585
01:00:28,149 --> 01:00:29,779
We're done. Did we overtake them?

1586
01:00:29,779 --> 01:00:31,809
(How's Ji Hyo and Jong Kook's team doing?)

1587
01:00:31,809 --> 01:00:34,049
(How's Ji Hyo and Jong Kook's team doing?)

1588
01:00:34,149 --> 01:00:35,649
We're done. Did we overtake them?

1589
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:40,209
Your team placed first.

1590
01:00:40,209 --> 01:00:44,179
(Haha and Kwang Soo's team finishes Crossword Puzzle Race.)

1591
01:00:45,479 --> 01:00:46,679
(We ate and won.)

1592
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:48,079
We won first place.

1593
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,949
(We ate and won.)

1594
01:00:53,309 --> 01:00:58,209
(Results of Crossword Puzzle Race Round 2)

1595
01:00:59,609 --> 01:01:03,279
(Beautiful lights lit up the night sky in Busan.)

1596
01:01:03,279 --> 01:01:06,209
- I've wanted to come here. - It looks like a road with flowers.

1597
01:01:06,209 --> 01:01:07,749
(What's their last mission?)

1598
01:01:07,749 --> 01:01:09,849
- It's amazing. - It's so beautiful here.

1599
01:01:09,849 --> 01:01:11,679
Is this where the winning team sits?

1600
01:01:13,709 --> 01:01:15,709
Here are the prizes for the winners.

1601
01:01:15,709 --> 01:01:17,409
(There are 8 prizes.)

1602
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:19,579
- A massager. - Giant octopus.

1603
01:01:19,749 --> 01:01:21,749
There are so many prizes.

1604
01:01:21,749 --> 01:01:23,909
We also have Eonyang bulgogi for Momo.

1605
01:01:24,749 --> 01:01:25,849
Does she like Eonyang bulgogi?

1606
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:27,949
Momo loves Eonyang bulgogi.

1607
01:01:27,949 --> 01:01:29,509
You should win that prize.

1608
01:01:29,849 --> 01:01:31,679
- Does the winner take all? - The winner takes everything.

1609
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:33,649
(The team that places first takes everything.)

1610
01:01:33,649 --> 01:01:35,449
- Really? - I'll give it to you as a present.

1611
01:01:35,549 --> 01:01:38,079
- We didn't have Eonyang bulgogi. - Eonyang bulgogi is delicious.

1612
01:01:38,449 --> 01:01:42,679
Haha and Kwang Soo's team was the 1st to clear the 2nd mission...

1613
01:01:42,679 --> 01:01:46,709
of Crossword Puzzle, so we'll give you 15 candies.

1614
01:01:46,709 --> 01:01:49,209
- Here are your candies. - Thank you.

1615
01:01:49,979 --> 01:01:51,909
(Why candies?)

1616
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:53,809
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo's team gets 10.

1617
01:01:54,179 --> 01:01:55,249
Goodness.

1618
01:01:55,249 --> 01:01:58,349
Jae Seok and Seok Jin's team gets 5.

1619
01:01:58,549 --> 01:01:59,809
(Will we play a game with candies?)

1620
01:01:59,809 --> 01:02:01,779
- What's going on? - The final round is...

1621
01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:05,349
"Secret Run" that's based on a secret auction.

1622
01:02:05,349 --> 01:02:06,809
(Secret Run)

1623
01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:09,679
There are a total of three rounds.

1624
01:02:09,849 --> 01:02:12,649
The staff member will call out the game category.

1625
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:16,509
The team that wants to play will make a secret bid...

1626
01:02:16,509 --> 01:02:20,479
with the number of candies they have.

1627
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:22,379
We don't have that many.

1628
01:02:22,379 --> 01:02:24,009
It's better to have more candies.

1629
01:02:24,009 --> 01:02:26,679
The team with the highest number makes a successful bid.

1630
01:02:27,149 --> 01:02:31,249
If you win the game, we'll give you additional candies that you bid.

1631
01:02:31,249 --> 01:02:33,879
(They will be given additional candies.)

1632
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:35,909
If you lose the game,

1633
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:38,509
the candies you bid will be shared by the other two teams.

1634
01:02:38,509 --> 01:02:39,849
(Upon losing, the candies you bid will be shared.)

1635
01:02:39,849 --> 01:02:41,049
It's difficult to know the result.

1636
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:43,349
- The other two teams take them. - We have a chance to win.

1637
01:02:43,349 --> 01:02:45,349
- We could win. - Who knows what will happen?

1638
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:47,709
- It'd be amazing if we win. - I know.

1639
01:02:47,709 --> 01:02:49,249
Let's win this game.

1640
01:02:49,249 --> 01:02:52,009
(Will a miracle take place for Jae Seok and Seok Jin's team?)

1641
01:02:52,009 --> 01:02:53,979
Here's your first mission.

1642
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:55,449
This is Round One.

1643
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:57,379
It's "Split the Apples".

1644
01:02:57,379 --> 01:03:00,549
(Round One is "Split the Apples".)

1645
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:03,909
One member from each team can play.

1646
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:05,909
The time limit is 30 seconds.

1647
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:12,009
The player who splits more than 18 apples wins.

1648
01:03:12,009 --> 01:03:14,409
- Jae Seok is good at splitting. - I know.

1649
01:03:14,909 --> 01:03:17,779
I'd give it a try if we had at least 10 candies,

1650
01:03:17,779 --> 01:03:20,709
- but we only have five. - We don't have enough.

1651
01:03:20,709 --> 01:03:23,909
You should have done a better job playing other games.

1652
01:03:25,049 --> 01:03:26,949
You erased two of our menu items.

1653
01:03:26,949 --> 01:03:28,949
Can you even play with only five candies?

1654
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:31,879
- You wait and see. - This is so annoying.

1655
01:03:32,449 --> 01:03:35,009
- My goodness. - Give them some candies for free.

1656
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:36,909
Shall we make a bid of five candies?

1657
01:03:37,049 --> 01:03:39,179
- Go ahead. - We'll make the bid.

1658
01:03:39,249 --> 01:03:41,379
After that, all of you can go home.

1659
01:03:41,779 --> 01:03:43,109
Right?

1660
01:03:43,509 --> 01:03:45,649
- Why don't you go ahead? - Hey.

1661
01:03:45,649 --> 01:03:48,309
After we make the bid, it's a war between us.

1662
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:50,549
- It's a war. - Go ahead and make the bid.

1663
01:03:50,549 --> 01:03:52,409
- You have nothing to fight with. - Calm down.

1664
01:03:52,409 --> 01:03:53,649
- Make the bid. - Calm down.

1665
01:03:53,649 --> 01:03:54,949
- No, we can't. - Na Yeon, make the bid.

1666
01:03:55,249 --> 01:03:56,809
Look at those punks.

1667
01:03:56,809 --> 01:03:58,709
Jae Seok is good at splitting apples. Give me an apple.

1668
01:03:59,079 --> 01:04:00,149
Just give me one.

1669
01:04:00,149 --> 01:04:01,449
- I'm sorry. - Just give us one.

1670
01:04:01,449 --> 01:04:03,079
We don't have much, so please understand.

1671
01:04:03,249 --> 01:04:04,879
- We don't have any. - Give it a try.

1672
01:04:04,879 --> 01:04:06,409
- Try splitting one. - Let me see it.

1673
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:08,179
- We have to split more than 18? - Go.

1674
01:04:08,909 --> 01:04:13,849
(He tries to forestall the other teams with his demonstration.)

1675
01:04:13,849 --> 01:04:15,209
(Completely in focus)

1676
01:04:15,209 --> 01:04:16,609
- He can't do it. - I can't do it.

1677
01:04:16,609 --> 01:04:18,149
(He can't do it.)

1678
01:04:18,149 --> 01:04:19,949
(Put the apple back.)

1679
01:04:19,949 --> 01:04:21,649
- No. - Don't even try it.

1680
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:22,909
Give him a different apple.

1681
01:04:22,909 --> 01:04:24,549
- Don't do it. - Don't try it.

1682
01:04:24,549 --> 01:04:26,949
(They quickly give up on him.)

1683
01:04:26,949 --> 01:04:29,479
Let's forget it. Sit back down.

1684
01:04:29,479 --> 01:04:31,109
Thank goodness it wasn't the actual game.

1685
01:04:31,309 --> 01:04:33,949
Those apples are difficult to split.

1686
01:04:34,409 --> 01:04:36,209
Here are the bids...

1687
01:04:36,949 --> 01:04:38,679
that three teams made.

1688
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:44,609
(How many did each team bid?)

1689
01:04:44,949 --> 01:04:46,449
In 1, 2, 3.

1690
01:04:47,309 --> 01:04:48,609
They made a big bid.

1691
01:04:48,949 --> 01:04:49,979
Three?

1692
01:04:49,979 --> 01:04:51,749
We made a successful bid.

1693
01:04:51,979 --> 01:04:54,479
If they lose, we take 2 and the other takes 1.

1694
01:04:54,479 --> 01:04:56,509
- That's right. - I'd be happy to win one.

1695
01:04:56,509 --> 01:04:57,579
You can do it.

1696
01:04:57,579 --> 01:04:58,779
- Goodness. - You can do it.

1697
01:04:58,779 --> 01:05:00,809
- There's too much pressure. - He looks handsome.

1698
01:05:01,109 --> 01:05:02,179
You can do it.

1699
01:05:02,179 --> 01:05:03,449
There's too much pressure.

1700
01:05:03,449 --> 01:05:07,209
- It's because of you. - You'll be sexy if you succeed.

1701
01:05:07,279 --> 01:05:09,179
Some apples are easier to split than others.

1702
01:05:09,179 --> 01:05:10,409
Don't try too hard to win.

1703
01:05:10,409 --> 01:05:13,179
Don't be disappointed even if I lose.

1704
01:05:13,179 --> 01:05:14,849
- Don't be disappointed. - We won't.

1705
01:05:14,849 --> 01:05:16,009
Don't be disappointed.

1706
01:05:16,009 --> 01:05:18,349
- You should start already. - Don't put pressure on him.

1707
01:05:18,349 --> 01:05:20,779
- Let's get started. - I was never good at this.

1708
01:05:20,779 --> 01:05:22,409
I'm telling you that I'm not good at it.

1709
01:05:22,409 --> 01:05:24,079
Just do a good job, Kwang Soo.

1710
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:25,509
- There's a lot of pressure on you. - No way.

1711
01:05:25,509 --> 01:05:27,549
- He can't split 18 in 30 seconds. - No, he can't.

1712
01:05:27,709 --> 01:05:29,309
I bet he can't even split 10 apples.

1713
01:05:29,309 --> 01:05:30,509
Get ready.

1714
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:31,979
He's tensing up.

1715
01:05:32,249 --> 01:05:34,049
- He's already tense. - He should be.

1716
01:05:34,049 --> 01:05:35,749
(I'm not alone anymore.)

1717
01:05:35,749 --> 01:05:39,209
(There are three ladies who depend on me.)

1718
01:05:39,579 --> 01:05:40,849
I love you, Kwang Soo.

1719
01:05:40,849 --> 01:05:45,149
(He received a lot of unconditional love.)

1720
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:48,309
(It's too difficult if you like me too much.)

1721
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:50,109
(You can do it, Kwang Soo.)

1722
01:05:51,149 --> 01:05:52,809
Get ready, go.

1723
01:05:53,749 --> 01:05:55,579
- It's a losing game. - He won't make it.

1724
01:05:55,809 --> 01:05:57,509
(It's a losing game.)

1725
01:05:58,609 --> 01:05:59,749
(Splitting)

1726
01:05:59,749 --> 01:06:00,749
He must split 18.

1727
01:06:01,809 --> 01:06:03,279
- Gosh. - The bigger side should go up.

1728
01:06:03,279 --> 01:06:04,809
The bigger side should go up.

1729
01:06:04,809 --> 01:06:07,109
- That's right. - He might make it.

1730
01:06:07,579 --> 01:06:09,009
- You're doing well. - You can do it.

1731
01:06:09,009 --> 01:06:10,879
- He might make it. - It's possible.

1732
01:06:10,879 --> 01:06:11,979
You can do it.

1733
01:06:11,979 --> 01:06:13,179
He might succeed.

1734
01:06:13,779 --> 01:06:15,209
Forget about this one.

1735
01:06:15,209 --> 01:06:16,949
(Forget about this one.)

1736
01:06:16,949 --> 01:06:18,409
You can't do that.

1737
01:06:18,779 --> 01:06:21,379
(He has 8 seconds left with 8 more to split.)

1738
01:06:21,379 --> 01:06:22,609
How many more does he have?

1739
01:06:22,749 --> 01:06:24,879
- This is amazing. - You're doing well.

1740
01:06:25,749 --> 01:06:28,579
(Da Hyun, Sana, Ji Hyo)

1741
01:06:28,579 --> 01:06:32,149
(I dedicate my day to all of you.)

1742
01:06:33,249 --> 01:06:34,749
(He's fueled by the power of love.)

1743
01:06:34,749 --> 01:06:36,049
How does he do that?

1744
01:06:36,579 --> 01:06:39,409
- You're doing well. - There are only 30 seconds.

1745
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:41,049
You're almost there.

1746
01:06:41,049 --> 01:06:44,809
(The mission is uncleared.)

1747
01:06:45,479 --> 01:06:47,449
(The other team smiles.)

1748
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,949
(I was so close.)

1749
01:06:50,349 --> 01:06:53,909
(They make crying faces.)

1750
01:06:53,909 --> 01:06:55,209
Look over here, Kwang Soo.

1751
01:06:55,209 --> 01:06:56,649
(He suddenly feels like a fool.)

1752
01:06:56,649 --> 01:06:58,079
It wasn't an easy game.

1753
01:06:58,779 --> 01:07:00,949
It's easy to split them when you have bigger hands.

1754
01:07:01,279 --> 01:07:02,709
- Good job. - Did you split 12 apples?

1755
01:07:03,249 --> 01:07:05,249
I'm sorry, everyone.

1756
01:07:05,609 --> 01:07:07,979
- It's okay. - We won two candies.

1757
01:07:08,279 --> 01:07:10,079
- We have six candies now. - Right.

1758
01:07:10,249 --> 01:07:11,779
We have more.

1759
01:07:12,279 --> 01:07:13,809
This is Round Two.

1760
01:07:14,049 --> 01:07:16,479
The second mission is "Splitting the Legs".

1761
01:07:16,479 --> 01:07:18,979
- What? - I can't do that.

1762
01:07:19,749 --> 01:07:21,049
Are you good at it?

1763
01:07:21,049 --> 01:07:23,249
(Everyone is confident.)

1764
01:07:23,249 --> 01:07:24,479
She can do it.

1765
01:07:24,879 --> 01:07:27,579
Can you do it? Who can do it the best?

1766
01:07:27,579 --> 01:07:29,109
Wait a minute.

1767
01:07:29,479 --> 01:07:31,149
How do you play the game?

1768
01:07:31,149 --> 01:07:33,979
Do we have to wait for another chance?

1769
01:07:33,979 --> 01:07:36,049
Mina danced ballet for 11 years.

1770
01:07:36,049 --> 01:07:37,949
Mina danced ballet for 11 years?

1771
01:07:37,949 --> 01:07:39,379
- Who? - Here's Mina.

1772
01:07:39,379 --> 01:07:40,509
Really?

1773
01:07:40,679 --> 01:07:42,379
Let's exclude Mina.

1774
01:07:42,649 --> 01:07:44,849
Everyone on the team must play it.

1775
01:07:44,849 --> 01:07:46,579
- We're doomed. - Goodness.

1776
01:07:46,579 --> 01:07:50,709
The total length of your split legs must be over 10m...

1777
01:07:50,879 --> 01:07:52,779
for the team to succeed.

1778
01:07:52,779 --> 01:07:54,749
- Is that 10m? - Is that 10m long?

1779
01:07:55,779 --> 01:07:56,879
- Goodness. - Is that how long it is?

1780
01:07:56,879 --> 01:07:58,409
That's really long.

1781
01:07:58,409 --> 01:07:59,879
- Our legs aren't that long. - We can't do it.

1782
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:02,009
- I think we can do it. - Do you think so?

1783
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:03,879
Isn't it too long?

1784
01:08:04,309 --> 01:08:06,349
- Her legs are long. - I told you they are.

1785
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:07,909
You can do it one by one.

1786
01:08:08,649 --> 01:08:10,779
- Her legs are long. - I told you they are.

1787
01:08:11,849 --> 01:08:13,149
- Her legs are long. - How about us?

1788
01:08:13,279 --> 01:08:14,579
Jeong Yeon can split hers, too.

1789
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:17,379
- Everyone else except me can do it. - We can do it, too.

1790
01:08:17,379 --> 01:08:18,949
Let me stretch first.

1791
01:08:18,949 --> 01:08:21,149
(Jeong Yeon starts to help.)

1792
01:08:22,049 --> 01:08:26,509
(Screaming in pain)

1793
01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:29,779
- Gosh, Jeong Yeon. - Yes?

1794
01:08:30,679 --> 01:08:32,779
- Jeong Yeon, please. - Are you okay?

1795
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,149
I think you can do it.

1796
01:08:36,749 --> 01:08:39,149
(Screaming even more)

1797
01:08:39,249 --> 01:08:40,779
I don't think we can do it.

1798
01:08:40,779 --> 01:08:41,919
Let's go back to our seats.

1799
01:08:41,919 --> 01:08:43,709
We can't do it.

1800
01:08:44,049 --> 01:08:47,179
(Haha and Kwang Soo's team is having a serious discussion.)

1801
01:08:47,949 --> 01:08:51,109
Let's put our shoes on like this.

1802
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:54,149
(She pulls her heel out of the shoe.)

1803
01:08:55,009 --> 01:08:57,919
(She learned only bad things from Haha and Kwang Soo.)

1804
01:08:57,919 --> 01:08:59,209
- Come on. - She's so cute.

1805
01:08:59,209 --> 01:09:00,279
(Everyone cheats on Running Man.)

1806
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:02,449
- I thought she had a good idea. - Me, too.

1807
01:09:02,849 --> 01:09:06,109
Chae Young, Mina, Tzuyu, and Jong Kook can do it.

1808
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:08,249
Help me a little.

1809
01:09:08,949 --> 01:09:10,449
- Shall we give it a try? - We can do it.

1810
01:09:10,449 --> 01:09:12,479
- Five is enough. - Let's make a bigger bid.

1811
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:13,979
I'm confident about this.

1812
01:09:14,249 --> 01:09:16,009
- How about six? - Let's bid one more.

1813
01:09:16,249 --> 01:09:17,449
Come on, Ji Hyo.

1814
01:09:17,709 --> 01:09:19,879
- We live only once. - What's wrong with you?

1815
01:09:19,879 --> 01:09:21,649
Do you want us to lose everything?

1816
01:09:22,209 --> 01:09:24,449
(Ji Hyo gets risky with the bidding.)

1817
01:09:24,879 --> 01:09:27,679
I hope the team that plays loses...

1818
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,949
so that we can get more candies.

1819
01:09:29,949 --> 01:09:31,649
Do you want candies without doing anything?

1820
01:09:31,649 --> 01:09:33,849
- We might even win. - I'm sorry,

1821
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:36,879
but why did you even declare war?

1822
01:09:37,149 --> 01:09:38,279
This is a war.

1823
01:09:38,509 --> 01:09:41,109
- You need something to fight with. - Didn't you want a war?

1824
01:09:41,109 --> 01:09:43,649
Winning the war is more important than winning a battle.

1825
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:45,709
- Let's go. - We made the bid.

1826
01:09:45,949 --> 01:09:48,179
In 1, 2, 3.

1827
01:09:48,179 --> 01:09:51,509
(What's the result of the bid?)

1828
01:09:51,509 --> 01:09:52,679
Why did you bid so much?

1829
01:09:52,679 --> 01:09:55,209
In 1, 2, 3.

1830
01:09:56,919 --> 01:09:59,349
- Why did you bid so much? - Yes.

1831
01:09:59,349 --> 01:10:01,649
- 10? - If they win,

1832
01:10:01,649 --> 01:10:04,709
- we don't get any candies. - They might lose.

1833
01:10:05,479 --> 01:10:07,109
- We can do it. - They're good at it.

1834
01:10:07,109 --> 01:10:09,779
Let's get into positions and try it.

1835
01:10:09,979 --> 01:10:12,079
Measure the length accurately.

1836
01:10:12,309 --> 01:10:14,779
We'll measure the length.

1837
01:10:14,779 --> 01:10:16,419
This is wider than I thought.

1838
01:10:16,419 --> 01:10:18,979
- Each person has to split the legs. - This is quite long.

1839
01:10:18,979 --> 01:10:20,609
- Let's give it a try. - They won't make it.

1840
01:10:20,609 --> 01:10:21,779
Wait a minute.

1841
01:10:21,779 --> 01:10:23,209
(But they have Mina on their team.)

1842
01:10:23,209 --> 01:10:24,979
You can do it.

1843
01:10:24,979 --> 01:10:29,949
(How flexible will Mina be with 11 years of dancing ballet?)

1844
01:10:30,849 --> 01:10:31,919
You can do it.

1845
01:10:32,509 --> 01:10:33,809
Isn't that too...

1846
01:10:33,809 --> 01:10:35,279
- Nice. - She did it.

1847
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:36,849
(This is easy.)

1848
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:40,379
- She did it. - Isn't that too...

1849
01:10:40,379 --> 01:10:43,609
(She went way over 2m.)

1850
01:10:43,609 --> 01:10:45,919
- Mina is good. - She's even better.

1851
01:10:46,249 --> 01:10:48,079
(Chae Young also knows how to stretch.)

1852
01:10:48,079 --> 01:10:49,849
(Mina isn't the only one who's good at this.)

1853
01:10:49,849 --> 01:10:51,379
Chae Young can't reach it.

1854
01:10:51,379 --> 01:10:52,849
- Come closer, Tzuyu. - There you go.

1855
01:10:52,849 --> 01:10:55,479
- This will definitely work. - Use your toes.

1856
01:10:55,479 --> 01:10:56,479
- They did it. - How is that possible?

1857
01:10:56,479 --> 01:10:58,449
(There are 3.5m left.)

1858
01:10:59,349 --> 01:11:04,079
(The success of this mission depends on Ji Hyo's flexibility.)

1859
01:11:05,549 --> 01:11:10,279
(How wide can Ji Hyo reach?)

1860
01:11:10,279 --> 01:11:11,979
(She did a decent job.)

1861
01:11:11,979 --> 01:11:14,009
- We can do it. - We did it!

1862
01:11:14,009 --> 01:11:16,479
(Jong Kook is the last one left.)

1863
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:19,179
(Will they be able to succeed this mission?)

1864
01:11:20,349 --> 01:11:22,109
We did it!

1865
01:11:22,579 --> 01:11:24,179
- He went over. - We did it.

1866
01:11:24,979 --> 01:11:26,079
(They need to stay for 5 seconds to succeed.)

1867
01:11:26,079 --> 01:11:29,249
- In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. - Stay like that for 4 minutes.

1868
01:11:29,919 --> 01:11:31,009
- They did it. - Mission successful.

1869
01:11:31,009 --> 01:11:33,379
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo's team succeeds the mission.)

1870
01:11:33,379 --> 01:11:35,179
- We did it! - We did it.

1871
01:11:35,379 --> 01:11:37,849
- Good job. - We did it.

1872
01:11:38,079 --> 01:11:41,009
We have 22 now.

1873
01:11:41,009 --> 01:11:42,179
We did it.

1874
01:11:42,179 --> 01:11:45,879
We should have placed the bet. I told you they'd do it.

1875
01:11:45,879 --> 01:11:47,579
We should give it a try, too.

1876
01:11:47,649 --> 01:11:48,679
We could probably do it, too.

1877
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:50,419
Let's give it a try just for the fun of it.

1878
01:11:51,979 --> 01:11:53,279
We probably would've been able to do it.

1879
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:54,809
It's amazing how flexible they are.

1880
01:11:54,809 --> 01:11:56,809
- I didn't think they could do it. - They're really flexible.

1881
01:11:56,809 --> 01:11:58,179
How did they do that?

1882
01:11:58,179 --> 01:11:59,479
- I'm not that flexible. - Let's see how it goes.

1883
01:11:59,809 --> 01:12:00,979
Na Yeon and Jeong Yeon aren't touching.

1884
01:12:00,979 --> 01:12:02,279
Na Yeon is humane.

1885
01:12:03,249 --> 01:12:04,279
Na Yeon and Jeong Yeon aren't touching.

1886
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:05,679
Na Yeon is humane.

1887
01:12:06,379 --> 01:12:09,109
- Na Yeon is humane. - That's something new.

1888
01:12:09,379 --> 01:12:11,449
We can't do it, Na Yeon.

1889
01:12:11,449 --> 01:12:13,379
- This isn't going to work. - We can't do this.

1890
01:12:13,379 --> 01:12:14,809
(Let's give up.)

1891
01:12:15,079 --> 01:12:16,249
This isn't going to work.

1892
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,849
- Na Yeon is very humane. - It's not going to work, Na Yeon.

1893
01:12:18,849 --> 01:12:21,009
- I told you I can't do it. - She's very humane.

1894
01:12:21,009 --> 01:12:23,149
I told you we can't do it.

1895
01:12:23,149 --> 01:12:25,509
- We can't do it. - It's because of me.

1896
01:12:25,609 --> 01:12:26,849
We wouldn't be successful even if we tried.

1897
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:29,449
Haha and Kwang Soo's team has 28.

1898
01:12:29,749 --> 01:12:32,179
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo's team has 22.

1899
01:12:32,609 --> 01:12:34,279
This is the third and last round.

1900
01:12:34,279 --> 01:12:37,809
(This is the third round of Secret Run.)

1901
01:12:37,809 --> 01:12:38,879
It's "Team Jump Rope".

1902
01:12:38,879 --> 01:12:40,109
(Team Jump Rope)

1903
01:12:40,109 --> 01:12:41,449
- That's not bad. - It's a good game.

1904
01:12:41,449 --> 01:12:42,879
(A team of 3 has to jump the rope 35 times.)

1905
01:12:42,879 --> 01:12:45,179
- This will be easy. - Sure.

1906
01:12:46,179 --> 01:12:48,179
We have to go all in, Haha.

1907
01:12:48,349 --> 01:12:50,079
- Okay. - Bet them all.

1908
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:53,079
They'll probably go all in.

1909
01:12:53,079 --> 01:12:56,179
We can't play the game even if we make the bet, right?

1910
01:12:56,379 --> 01:12:59,079
- No, we can't. - There's nothing we can do.

1911
01:12:59,079 --> 01:13:01,479
- No. - There isn't anything we can do.

1912
01:13:01,479 --> 01:13:02,949
I want to give this game a try.

1913
01:13:03,419 --> 01:13:04,779
You've never played games before?

1914
01:13:04,779 --> 01:13:07,009
This isn't just a game for you. It's a war.

1915
01:13:07,009 --> 01:13:08,449
You're warriors.

1916
01:13:08,449 --> 01:13:10,879
- They're at war. - It's a war.

1917
01:13:10,879 --> 01:13:13,309
It's a war without weapons.

1918
01:13:13,879 --> 01:13:16,349
(We do have six candies, though.)

1919
01:13:16,349 --> 01:13:17,379
Should we just eat them?

1920
01:13:17,379 --> 01:13:18,579
(Should we just eat them?)

1921
01:13:18,579 --> 01:13:20,009
Do you want one?

1922
01:13:20,949 --> 01:13:22,579
(The other teams are having fun practicing.)

1923
01:13:25,249 --> 01:13:26,309
It's good.

1924
01:13:26,709 --> 01:13:29,849
(They are forced to become the audience.)

1925
01:13:31,419 --> 01:13:32,809
Did you all place your bets?

1926
01:13:32,919 --> 01:13:34,009
- Yes. - We finished placing our bets.

1927
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:35,349
We're here to win.

1928
01:13:35,349 --> 01:13:37,249
Let's check the bets. One.

1929
01:13:37,249 --> 01:13:39,079
(It's a battle between the safe choice and the bold move.)

1930
01:13:39,579 --> 01:13:41,879
(It's the only team to challenge the last mission.)

1931
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:44,079
(Which team placed the highest bid?)

1932
01:13:44,179 --> 01:13:46,209
One, two, three.

1933
01:13:47,979 --> 01:13:48,979
We bet 13 candies.

1934
01:13:49,549 --> 01:13:51,849
- 13? - That's 1 more than theirs.

1935
01:13:51,849 --> 01:13:52,849
(Oh, my.)

1936
01:13:52,949 --> 01:13:54,579
(Their betting is higher than Haha and Kwang Soo's team's all in.)

1937
01:13:54,579 --> 01:13:56,309
If you fail, you will automatically come in last.

1938
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,609
- It's all or nothing. - You could get a penalty.

1939
01:13:58,849 --> 01:14:01,179
(It's all up to Tzuyu, Chae Young, and Mina.)

1940
01:14:01,179 --> 01:14:02,679
If they fail, we'll be placed first.

1941
01:14:03,579 --> 01:14:04,579
Ji Hyo.

1942
01:14:04,579 --> 01:14:05,749
- Ready, - Let's go.

1943
01:14:05,749 --> 01:14:07,749
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1944
01:14:07,749 --> 01:14:09,009
- This is too funny. - Please.

1945
01:14:09,009 --> 01:14:10,449
- Let's go! - Please fail.

1946
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:12,049
You're mean.

1947
01:14:12,579 --> 01:14:13,609
Ready.

1948
01:14:13,609 --> 01:14:15,079
(The final winner will be decided...)

1949
01:14:15,079 --> 01:14:17,749
(by this game of "Team Jump Rope".)

1950
01:14:18,679 --> 01:14:20,179
(You either win big or go home.)

1951
01:14:20,179 --> 01:14:21,549
(What will be the result of their bold decision?)

1952
01:14:21,549 --> 01:14:22,609
- Go. - Go.

1953
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:24,549
(They have to jump rope 35 times in order to succeed the mission.)

1954
01:14:24,579 --> 01:14:26,779
- Two, three, four. - I think they'll make it.

1955
01:14:26,779 --> 01:14:29,849
(They have good teamwork.)

1956
01:14:30,779 --> 01:14:33,249
(Are they actually going to do it?)

1957
01:14:33,879 --> 01:14:36,009
- We did 10. - 11, 12.

1958
01:14:36,009 --> 01:14:38,709
(He's praying that they fail.)

1959
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:41,749
- 16, 17, 18. - 16, 17, 18.

1960
01:14:41,749 --> 01:14:43,919
(The audience is excited.)

1961
01:14:45,309 --> 01:14:47,449
(The rope might hit the staff members.)

1962
01:14:47,849 --> 01:14:49,849
- 24, 25. - 24, 25.

1963
01:14:49,849 --> 01:14:51,709
(Only 10 more to go.)

1964
01:14:51,709 --> 01:14:54,009
(Why are they so good?)

1965
01:14:54,009 --> 01:14:56,479
- 30, 31, 32. - Why are they so good?

1966
01:14:56,479 --> 01:14:59,649
(They only need to do three more to become the final winner.)

1967
01:15:00,749 --> 01:15:02,079
(Don't do it.)

1968
01:15:02,449 --> 01:15:03,479
- 34. - 34.

1969
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,379
(Only one more to go.)

1970
01:15:05,379 --> 01:15:08,079
(One more jump and they're the winner.)

1971
01:15:08,679 --> 01:15:12,249
(Will they be able to succeed?)

1972
01:15:12,449 --> 01:15:13,679
- 35, 36. - 35, 36.

1973
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:15,149
(They went over 35.)

1974
01:15:16,049 --> 01:15:17,979
- 35, 36. - 35, 36.

1975
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:19,919
We did it. We did it!

1976
01:15:19,919 --> 01:15:21,749
(Team Jong Kook and Ji Hyo wins the Crossword Puzzle Race.)

1977
01:15:21,749 --> 01:15:23,549
It should be at least 50.

1978
01:15:23,549 --> 01:15:26,009
- Good job. - We did it!

1979
01:15:26,009 --> 01:15:27,649
(We'll take the prize while you two are battling.)

1980
01:15:27,649 --> 01:15:29,249
That was hard, wasn't it?

1981
01:15:29,349 --> 01:15:30,709
I'm sorry.

1982
01:15:31,249 --> 01:15:32,679
I'm sorry we had to put you through this.

1983
01:15:32,849 --> 01:15:34,879
I'm sorry we couldn't even give you an opportunity.

1984
01:15:35,179 --> 01:15:36,179
I'm sorry.

1985
01:15:36,809 --> 01:15:38,049
It's okay.

1986
01:15:38,249 --> 01:15:39,279
I'm sorry, Da Hyun.

1987
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:40,779
- Is it over? - I'm sorry.

1988
01:15:40,779 --> 01:15:42,449
Take your prize.

1989
01:15:42,449 --> 01:15:43,919
Mina said she wanted Eonyang Bulgogi.

1990
01:15:43,919 --> 01:15:46,149
- That's right. - Here it is.

1991
01:15:47,179 --> 01:15:49,579
- Thank you. - This is amazing.

1992
01:15:49,609 --> 01:15:52,549
We'd like to thank the nine members of Twice...

1993
01:15:52,549 --> 01:15:54,679
for joining us today in Busan.

1994
01:15:54,679 --> 01:15:56,279
(We'd like to thank Twice and the people of Busan for today.)

1995
01:15:57,779 --> 01:16:00,449
Will you stick together or play solo?

1996
01:16:00,879 --> 01:16:02,379
(This question...)

1997
01:16:02,379 --> 01:16:04,479
(visits the members out of nowhere.)

1998
01:16:04,509 --> 01:16:05,649
(Together or Apart)

1999
01:16:05,749 --> 01:16:08,049
(In Jeonju)

2000
01:16:08,049 --> 01:16:12,149
(It's the trip they have to fool the others and hide from them.)

2001
01:16:13,779 --> 01:16:15,679
(Together or Apart)

2002
01:16:15,979 --> 01:16:17,549
(What outcome will the decision bring?)

2003
01:16:18,609 --> 01:16:19,679
Let's part ways.

2004
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:22,179
(Together or Apart)
