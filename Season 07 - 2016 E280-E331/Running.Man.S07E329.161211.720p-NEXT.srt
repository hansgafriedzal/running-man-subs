1
00:00:04,058 --> 00:00:08,888
(It's morning in Jeonju, an artsy town that cultivated many artists.)

2
00:00:08,888 --> 00:00:12,958
(Here, a trial awaits for the members of Running Man.)

3
00:00:13,788 --> 00:00:17,598
(There's a throne for a king.)

4
00:00:17,598 --> 00:00:20,028
(There is a straw mat.)

5
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:23,928
(And is that a wooden table for flogging?)

6
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,061
(What are these items for?)

7
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:28,361
- Hello. - Hi.

8
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,661
- Hi. - What a nice day.

9
00:00:32,591 --> 00:00:34,991
Why are these men here? We just started.

10
00:00:34,991 --> 00:00:36,491
- What are these? - They are getting ready to...

11
00:00:36,491 --> 00:00:38,561
- give us a stick from the start. - Goodness.

12
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:40,261
- What is this chair for? - At least try to hide.

13
00:00:40,421 --> 00:00:42,091
- You're here. - Gosh.

14
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:45,361
We have started our filming for an episode in Jeonju.

15
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:48,361
- First, I'll ask you a question. - What is it?

16
00:00:48,861 --> 00:00:52,461
You can choose your answer as a collective group.

17
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:56,921
Will you be together or apart?

18
00:00:56,921 --> 00:00:59,791
(Will you be together or apart?)

19
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:03,191
Will you be together or apart?

20
00:01:03,191 --> 00:01:05,791
(Will they stay as a group or split? What will their choice be?)

21
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:09,491
If you decide to be together, you'll either live or die together.

22
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:12,731
If you decide to be apart, someone may be happy,

23
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:14,591
but someone will certainly be ruined.

24
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:16,321
(If they split, someone may be happy, but someone will be ruined.)

25
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:18,691
- Let's be together. - Yes, let's stay together.

26
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:20,461
- Yes, it's been a while. - Let's be together.

27
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:23,361
- We ought to be together. - We've been apart for some time.

28
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:25,691
It's so lonely when we split.

29
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:27,421
To be honest, I'll be jealous if someone does better than me.

30
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,821
- Some people will be ruined? - That's what he said.

31
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:31,161
- It's always been like this. - Let's be apart.

32
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:32,491
- Let's split. - Let's be apart.

33
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:34,321
I don't think it's such a bad idea after all.

34
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:36,691
It's nice that everyone will be responsible for the outcome.

35
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,291
You only live once.

36
00:01:38,861 --> 00:01:41,121
- Yes, we only have a shot at life. - Then...

37
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:43,921
can you uncover the sheet on the right?

38
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:47,161
- Unlucky ones will be ruined. - What's wrong with being together?

39
00:01:47,561 --> 00:01:49,591
- What is it? A straw mat, - A wooden table?

40
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:50,721
- a wooden table, and a throne? - A throne?

41
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:53,721
Isn't being rolled in the straw mat only for serious crimes?

42
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:55,761
Wouldn't it hurt to be smacked on the wooden table?

43
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:59,221
You'll do your opening sitting in this comfortable chair,

44
00:01:59,391 --> 00:02:01,791
sitting on this cold straw mat,

45
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:05,221
or getting smacked on this wooden table.

46
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:07,221
What have we done wrong to deserve the wooden table?

47
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:09,461
- We didn't do anything wrong. - Seriously.

48
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:10,691
Isn't this too much?

49
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:12,991
Will you be together or apart?

50
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:14,421
- Ji Hyo? - I want to be apart.

51
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:16,161
- Ji Hyo wants to be apart. - She's strong.

52
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:17,961
- I want to be on my own. - What do you want?

53
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:19,161
- She's an individualist. - What do you want?

54
00:02:19,161 --> 00:02:20,691
I want to stay together.

55
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,691
- Really? - It's better to be ruined together.

56
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:27,261
- If someone's bound to be ruined, - Someone will be.

57
00:02:27,261 --> 00:02:28,961
- I'll be the only one to succeed. - What did you say?

58
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:31,761
This is why. Because of your attitude, you're always picked on.

59
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:34,961
It would be fun to watch someone get ruined.

60
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:36,361
What do you think, Seok Jin?

61
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:38,421
Victory tastes sweeter when you're the only victor.

62
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,861
- It's better that way. - We'll follow the majority.

63
00:02:42,491 --> 00:02:44,721
- We'll be apart. - How about you, Jae Seok?

64
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:45,961
I want to be apart, too.

65
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:48,091
(They decided to be apart.)

66
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:50,021
- Let's split. - You'll regret it.

67
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:51,521
It's so hard to stay together.

68
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:54,561
In that case, please uncover the sheet on the left.

69
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:55,721
You chose to be apart.

70
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:58,191
It's better. See? Splitting could be better.

71
00:02:58,891 --> 00:03:01,061
- Splitting could be better. - Right.

72
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:04,261
- It's the ghost leg. - This will be fun.

73
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:05,761
- This is much better. - I'm confident.

74
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:07,091
- I'm good at this game. - Look at this.

75
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:09,721
Please choose a number.

76
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:11,521
- Ji Hyo, choose one. - I'll choose the first one.

77
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:13,791
- She took the first one. Jong Kook? - I'll take the second one.

78
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,291
- Why don't we just go in order? - Let's do that.

79
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,661
- Fine, we'll do that. - Let's just do it.

80
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:18,291
- So it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. - That's right.

81
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,361
- I'm have the sixth one. - Ji Hyo will go first.

82
00:03:20,721 --> 00:03:23,621
(The first one starts to make its way down.)

83
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:27,221
(Will she get the throne, the straw mat, or the wooden table?)

84
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:29,591
(What will she get?)

85
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:35,161
- She got the straw mat. - Okay.

86
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:38,021
(Even her nickname rhymes with the straw mat.)

87
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,421
Ji Hyo will take the straw mat.

88
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:41,691
Start the second one.

89
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,661
- I don't want the wooden table. - It's Jong Kook's turn.

90
00:03:48,321 --> 00:03:49,621
(The throne)

91
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:50,621
(He takes the throne.)

92
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:51,791
He's so lucky.

93
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,161
(I am the king.)

94
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:55,421
He's going to be an annoying king.

95
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:56,691
Let's start the third one.

96
00:03:56,691 --> 00:03:58,561
- I should've picked that one. - What's the third one?

97
00:03:58,561 --> 00:03:59,691
(Unlucky Jae Seok's leg starts.)

98
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:01,561
- It's Jae Seok's turn. - It has to go up, Ji Hyo.

99
00:04:01,561 --> 00:04:03,121
- It has to go up. - And it'll come down again.

100
00:04:03,121 --> 00:04:04,391
(What will Jae Seok get?)

101
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:05,421
- What is it? - Whose leg was this?

102
00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:06,591
- It's mine. - It's Jae Seok's.

103
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:08,291
- Whose leg was this? - It's Jae Seok's.

104
00:04:08,821 --> 00:04:10,621
(He gets the wooden table.)

105
00:04:11,361 --> 00:04:12,921
- He got the wooden table? - Please hit him hard.

106
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:15,221
- I knew it. - I won't get the wooden table now.

107
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:16,491
Sprinkle water on him beforehand.

108
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,461
- I can't believe this. - Sprinkle water on him.

109
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:20,891
- Let's move to the 4th one. - Didn't you choose the 3rd one?

110
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:22,761
- Move aside. - It's mine.

111
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:24,261
- You're truly unlucky. - It's Seok Jin's turn.

112
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:28,161
(As long as I'm safe, it's all good.)

113
00:04:29,661 --> 00:04:30,961
- Please be the throne. - It's the wooden table.

114
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:32,091
It's amazing.

115
00:04:32,091 --> 00:04:33,661
(Congratulations, Seok Jin.)

116
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:36,091
How can he be so unlucky?

117
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:37,221
(Now it's almost becoming a curse.)

118
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:40,321
Ji Hyo, you are lucky.

119
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,591
- The straw mat's better. - Seriously, it's much better.

120
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,361
- Who's next? - Do the next one.

121
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:45,891
- Kwang Soo's next. - That's right. I'm next.

122
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:52,561
(A throne and a straw mat remain.)

123
00:04:52,561 --> 00:04:54,821
(This outcome will tell the fates of the two men.)

124
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:58,521
(What will Unlucky Kwang Soo get?)

125
00:04:58,791 --> 00:04:59,891
He got the throne.

126
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:00,931
(The throne)

127
00:05:00,931 --> 00:05:03,191
- Then Haha gets... - My life has just begun!

128
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:04,491
My goodness.

129
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,321
- The wooden table's the worst. - It's coming in.

130
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:08,361
- Why do we need to get flogged? - It's a real one.

131
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:11,461
- All I did was select a number. - This is so much fun.

132
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:13,561
- We'll show you how it's done. - I can't believe this.

133
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:16,361
- This is the perfect size for him. - It's made for you.

134
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:17,761
- Jae Seok is ruined. - It's perfect for him.

135
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:21,091
If we were together, we would've spun the wheel.

136
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:22,861
- We would've gotten the same thing. - That's right.

137
00:05:22,861 --> 00:05:24,821
Do you want to spin it just to see what it could've been?

138
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:26,761
- Spin it. - Should I?

139
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:28,461
- Yes. - I wonder what would've happened...

140
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:30,091
if we stayed together.

141
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:31,921
- Seriously? - What if I spun it?

142
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:35,861
(What would've happened if everyone's fate depended on him?)

143
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:37,461
- We passed the wooden table. - It's the throne.

144
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:39,991
- No way. - It's the throne.

145
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:41,391
Wait, it passed it.

146
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:43,421
- Is it the wooden table? - It's the throne.

147
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:45,021
- The arrow is backing up. - It's the straw mat.

148
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:47,221
- We could've gotten the straw mat. - It could've been the straw mat.

149
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,291
- Hold on, it's not the mat. - It's moving.

150
00:05:49,491 --> 00:05:51,521
- It's the wooden table. - We would've had the wooden table.

151
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,391
- It's the wooden table. - I'm glad we split.

152
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:55,291
- Everyone could've gotten it. - It was the right call to be apart.

153
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,391
If only we stayed together...

154
00:05:57,391 --> 00:06:00,521
Do you see how unlucky I am?

155
00:06:00,521 --> 00:06:01,961
I don't even want to go near you.

156
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,291
Do you see now?

157
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,691
(I will never leave my fate to you.)

158
00:06:06,061 --> 00:06:08,461
Please take a seat in your choice of chairs.

159
00:06:08,621 --> 00:06:10,191
I didn't choose mine.

160
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:12,521
Go take a seat, Kwang Soo.

161
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:14,591
Do I even have the right to sit in a chair like this?

162
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:18,061
- This is nice. - This chair is really comfortable.

163
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:21,361
(Ones who got the straw mat will have to sit on the cold ground.)

164
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:23,221
(The six who chose to be apart ended up with different fates.)

165
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,591
I didn't do anything wrong.

166
00:06:25,621 --> 00:06:28,261
- What did I do? - What did we do wrong?

167
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:32,361
Please spank them when I raise my left hand.

168
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:33,991
I'll explain it to you now.

169
00:06:34,121 --> 00:06:35,121
This is fun.

170
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:39,061
Hold on. Shouldn't they be rolled up in straw mats?

171
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:40,421
(Spanked)

172
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:42,191
(Why are you so talkative?)

173
00:06:42,191 --> 00:06:44,521
- That was powerful. - What was that?

174
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:46,191
- What was that? - That really hurt.

175
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:47,221
What was that?

176
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:49,091
Are they professionals?

177
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:51,521
They're spanking you by certain rules.

178
00:06:51,521 --> 00:06:53,791
- I see. - Don't talk, Jae Seok.

179
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:55,561
I should stay still.

180
00:06:55,621 --> 00:06:58,291
I think you get spanked if you open your mouth.

181
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,891
Today's race is Probability Race: Together or Apart.

182
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:04,591
You may live together or die apart.

183
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,891
Let's just die.

184
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:07,991
- That'd be the cleanest way. - Yes.

185
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,921
You are to travel around Jeonju...

186
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:12,891
doing the Probability Race.

187
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,021
Probability Race, Jeonju Travel Guide.

188
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:17,791
From Deokjin Park to Hanok Village.

189
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,691
- They have food there. - I've been to Hanok Village often.

190
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:21,461
- We'll have a Korean course meal. - Nice.

191
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:24,221
- After that, we go to Nambu Market. - There's good food there, too.

192
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:26,121
Finally, we go to a guesthouse.

193
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:28,291
- This is looking good. - When are you going to hit us?

194
00:07:29,461 --> 00:07:30,461
"When"?

195
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:32,591
(I told you to watch your mouth.)

196
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:33,621
That really hurt.

197
00:07:33,691 --> 00:07:35,291
It's "when".

198
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:38,161
Can you spank each cheek evenly?

199
00:07:38,161 --> 00:07:39,691
He keeps hurting the right side.

200
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:41,361
It hurts so much.

201
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:44,161
There is one condition.

202
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:46,721
You will be asked to be together or apart...

203
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:49,421
like how you just decided on your chairs.

204
00:07:49,421 --> 00:07:51,021
- We have to decide every round. - I see.

205
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:52,261
This is the result of our being apart.

206
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:53,461
Let's stick together next time.

207
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:57,291
If you succeed your mission, you will be given R coins.

208
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,421
- R coins? - R coins.

209
00:07:58,421 --> 00:08:00,421
A plane ticket to Europe is on the prize list.

210
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:02,621
Why do we have to buy you a meal?

211
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:05,291
- It's a 29-dollar meal. - Because that's the legal limit.

212
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:07,521
- I see. - That's clever.

213
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:08,591
(We are law-abiding citizens.)

214
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:12,691
We will tell you the reason why you got spanked.

215
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:15,961
- What was it? - It was for asking questions.

216
00:08:16,591 --> 00:08:18,191
(The smallest decision will change your fate.)

217
00:08:18,191 --> 00:08:19,621
- Because we asked questions? - Yes.

218
00:08:19,621 --> 00:08:20,691
(What will be their fates?)

219
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:23,091
(Probability Race: Together or Apart)

220
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:25,621
(Deokjin Park)

221
00:08:25,621 --> 00:08:26,691
- Is this where we're doing it? - Yes.

222
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:28,791
You'll be unlucky whether we are together or apart.

223
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,261
Don't come to me asking for my help.

224
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,561
I have a really bad feeling about today.

225
00:08:35,191 --> 00:08:38,891
You saw me back there, right? Everything I touch turns bad.

226
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:40,791
The power of your unlucky aura is stronger than ever.

227
00:08:40,991 --> 00:08:42,531
- What's this? - There it is again.

228
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:45,061
- What's this? - "Fly swatter", "flippers",

229
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:48,191
- "normal paddles". - Are we rowing?

230
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:50,191
- Oh, gosh. - Let's just roll it.

231
00:08:50,191 --> 00:08:51,561
We should be together this time.

232
00:08:52,121 --> 00:08:53,461
Here are the rules.

233
00:08:53,531 --> 00:08:55,991
- Jeonju is the hometown of pansori. - Right.

234
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:57,791
For the first course of Jeonju Tour,

235
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,291
you'll get to enjoy our traditional sounds.

236
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,921
The name of the first mission is "Come Take a Quiz".

237
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:06,721
Two people will go on the same boat.

238
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:10,391
You will have to guess the title of the song...

239
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:14,121
by listening to the traditional singers sing.

240
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,691
Are the people on the same boat teams?

241
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,191
- This is an individual mission. - Okay.

242
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:23,221
The winner will get 40R with the prize getting smaller gradually.

243
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,261
Will you be together or apart?

244
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:26,361
Let's be apart.

245
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:29,191
- Let's be apart. - Why do you always want that?

246
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:31,821
- What? Let's be apart. - Why are you like that?

247
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:34,091
- I'd like that, too. - What about you, Ji Hyo?

248
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:36,221
I think it's better to be together this time.

249
00:09:36,221 --> 00:09:38,091
I think so, too.

250
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:40,191
Let's be together this time.

251
00:09:40,191 --> 00:09:41,721
Sounds good.

252
00:09:41,721 --> 00:09:44,031
Please spin the roulette.

253
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:45,421
- Please spin the roulette. - Okay.

254
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:48,121
- Why is it you two again? - Get away from there.

255
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,891
- Stop it. - Get your hands off of that.

256
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,221
(The members refuse to leave their fate to the unlucky.)

257
00:09:52,221 --> 00:09:53,721
- Don't do it. - You do it, Ji Hyo.

258
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:55,031
- Do it, then. - Ji Hyo is the better choice.

259
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:56,291
She's not that lucky.

260
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,291
What are you doing?

261
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,261
- Why did you do that? - What are you doing?

262
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:02,721
- I want to spin it. - Stop it.

263
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:04,191
- Let Ji Hyo do it. - Let go.

264
00:10:04,191 --> 00:10:06,531
- Let go. - Do it, Ji Hyo.

265
00:10:07,721 --> 00:10:09,691
Gosh. You guys are so mean.

266
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:13,161
Flippers would work, but fly swatters will be hard.

267
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:15,121
Are we in this together?

268
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:16,121
We are.

269
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,791
What did you do, Ji Hyo?

270
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,161
- Flippers aren't that bad. - We're getting flippers.

271
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,291
(Flippers)

272
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:24,691
(Jae Seok is cranky.)

273
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,291
I want to be apart.

274
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,121
Everyone will get flippers.

275
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:29,191
(Flippers, it is.)

276
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:31,191
- I knew this would happen. - Let's get on the boats now.

277
00:10:31,191 --> 00:10:33,691
Let's show them how fast we can row with flippers.

278
00:10:34,221 --> 00:10:35,821
I'm going to try seriously.

279
00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:38,031
(Everyone is ready to go with flippers.)

280
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:41,461
- This is better than fly swatters. - Of course.

281
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:43,291
It'll take at least eight hours with fly swatters.

282
00:10:43,721 --> 00:10:44,721
I'm sure of it.

283
00:10:44,721 --> 00:10:45,921
(That is true.)

284
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:47,891
(The singer with the quiz...)

285
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:49,421
(is all the way out there.)

286
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:50,891
- Let's go. - Let's go.

287
00:10:51,491 --> 00:10:52,721
(She's in the middle of Deokjin Park.)

288
00:10:52,721 --> 00:10:55,921
I know Seok Jin isn't going to try hard.

289
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,791
(Come row towards me.)

290
00:10:59,021 --> 00:11:00,091
(They get ready.)

291
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:01,821
Isn't it important who sits at the front?

292
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,621
It's much better this way.

293
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,621
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin get on the same boat.)

294
00:11:05,721 --> 00:11:07,461
You could row like this.

295
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:09,091
(Jong Kook and Kwang Soo get on the same boat.)

296
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:11,361
- This is easier. - It's better this way.

297
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:13,521
I'll start rowing first.

298
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:14,521
(Haha and Ji Hyo get on the same boat.)

299
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:16,521
You row that way and I'll row the opposite way.

300
00:11:16,521 --> 00:11:18,421
- Let's turn around. - We're good to go.

301
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:19,521
(Will they be able to row with flippers?)

302
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:20,721
- Ready... - Let's go.

303
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,961
This actually works.

304
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:24,921
- This works. - Set, go!

305
00:11:24,921 --> 00:11:26,591
(The first round gets started.)

306
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,821
(Charge towards the singer.)

307
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:29,991
- This is so slow. - It's working.

308
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:33,461
- Jong Kook. - Can you row harder?

309
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:35,721
Harder. Put your hands deep in the water.

310
00:11:35,721 --> 00:11:36,991
(The nagging starts.)

311
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:41,791
- Why are we going backwards? - I don't know.

312
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,361
- Why are we going backwards? - What's going on?

313
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:44,521
We have to row like this.

314
00:11:44,691 --> 00:11:46,421
That way, Jong Kook.

315
00:11:46,421 --> 00:11:47,521
We have to get there first.

316
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:49,721
- Where are we supposed to go? - Over there.

317
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:53,291
(That's where they're headed.)

318
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,291
Right.

319
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:56,261
(Welcome.)

320
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:57,891
Row harder.

321
00:11:57,891 --> 00:12:00,191
Maybe you should row less.

322
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:03,621
(It's the battle between the two boats.)

323
00:12:03,621 --> 00:12:05,721
- One, two. - One, two.

324
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:08,261
- Stop copying me. - What are you talking about?

325
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,021
(It's a close race.)

326
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,091
- Can you row less? - Row harder.

327
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,261
- This is the wrong direction. - Keep rowing.

328
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:17,421
- Can you row harder? Gosh. - There you go.

329
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:19,291
You have to row harder.

330
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:22,721
Row that way. The boat won't turn otherwise.

331
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:24,061
(They're rowing against each other's direction.)

332
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:26,721
(Where are you going?)

333
00:12:26,721 --> 00:12:27,961
I'll go this way.

334
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:32,191
(They landed on a swamp.)

335
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:33,921
We're stuck.

336
00:12:34,191 --> 00:12:36,461
Are you a crocodile?

337
00:12:38,221 --> 00:12:41,521
(While Haha and Ji Hyo are looking for crocodiles...)

338
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:42,621
- One, two. - There you go.

339
00:12:42,621 --> 00:12:43,991
(The other two boats have almost arrived.)

340
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:45,291
- We're almost there. - One, two.

341
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,921
- Kwang Soo. - Can you row harder?

342
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:50,361
(Jong Kook and Kwang Soo drift away.)

343
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:52,821
- We're almost there. - Stop rowing.

344
00:12:53,491 --> 00:12:57,091
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin arrive first.)

345
00:12:57,961 --> 00:12:59,421
- Can you do me a favor? - We're here.

346
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:01,861
- This is the first question. - We're here.

347
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:05,721
(I don't know)

348
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:06,721
What?

349
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:10,921
(Your eyes pretend to be innocent)

350
00:13:10,921 --> 00:13:14,721
(You put me up)

351
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:17,521
Hold on. What is she singing?

352
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:22,121
(Then I feel)

353
00:13:22,121 --> 00:13:24,961
(Loco)

354
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:27,521
(What on earth...)

355
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:29,291
(is she...)

356
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,691
(saying?)

357
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:34,961
What are you saying?

358
00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:37,721
(Hey, baby boy)

359
00:13:37,721 --> 00:13:38,791
What did you say?

360
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:45,021
(Stop spinning me around and around)

361
00:13:45,261 --> 00:13:48,721
(Hey, baby boy)

362
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,721
- Hold on. - I know this song.

363
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:53,291
- Do you get it? - Yes.

364
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,721
Why are we getting farther and farther away?

365
00:13:54,721 --> 00:13:57,291
(The song echoes throughout Deokjin Lake.)

366
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,691
(Up and down)

367
00:14:00,691 --> 00:14:03,361
(This song is...)

368
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:05,421
("Up and Down" by EXID)

369
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:08,291
(This cheerful melody...)

370
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:14,721
(is transformed into a sorrowful tune.)

371
00:14:15,091 --> 00:14:17,291
(It's a deplorable song.)

372
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:21,091
(It's a classical version of "Up and Down".)

373
00:14:22,521 --> 00:14:24,121
This song sounds familiar.

374
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:25,291
I don't get it.

375
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:28,421
Jae Seok will get to guess it first.

376
00:14:28,421 --> 00:14:29,621
Okay. Hold on.

377
00:14:29,621 --> 00:14:32,221
You have five seconds.

378
00:14:33,361 --> 00:14:34,821
- I didn't hear anything. - Five, four,

379
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:37,161
- Hold on. - Three, two,

380
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:40,461
(What did Jae Seok write down?)

381
00:14:40,461 --> 00:14:41,461
"Like Ooh-Ahh".

382
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:42,521
("Like Ooh-Ahh" by Twice)

383
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:44,291
- What? - By Twice.

384
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,991
(That is incorrect.)

385
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:50,591
(What kind of answer is that?)

386
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:53,091
"Round and Round" by Nami.

387
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:56,591
(Seok Jin thinks it's a song from the 1980s.)

388
00:14:56,921 --> 00:14:58,721
(It's Jong Kook and Kwang Soo's turn to guess.)

389
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:00,361
- "Up and Down" by EXID. - "Up and Down".

390
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:03,921
(Jong Kook and Kwang Soo both guess "Up and Down".)

391
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:04,921
Really?

392
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:07,191
Kwang Soo and Jong Kook guessed it correctly.

393
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:10,621
(Jong Kook and Kwang Soo both receive 40R.)

394
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:13,621
- I didn't know the lyrics. - Stop spinning me around

395
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,591
Up and down, up, up and down

396
00:15:16,591 --> 00:15:17,721
(Good job.)

397
00:15:18,591 --> 00:15:21,821
This is the second question.

398
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,191
What is it?

399
00:15:23,191 --> 00:15:24,361
(Drop the question.)

400
00:15:24,361 --> 00:15:28,191
(Every day it rings)

401
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:29,761
It's over there.

402
00:15:30,421 --> 00:15:33,061
(Where is this sound coming from?)

403
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:35,421
(I'm over here.)

404
00:15:36,091 --> 00:15:37,691
- What a mess. - Gosh.

405
00:15:37,691 --> 00:15:39,091
(She's at the dock where they took off in the beginning.)

406
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,421
Can you push our boat?

407
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:43,361
- Hold on. - We're coming.

408
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:45,591
Row faster.

409
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:47,291
(They have to go back the way they came from.)

410
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:49,561
I don't know, I don't know

411
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:50,791
This is really hard.

412
00:15:51,421 --> 00:15:53,721
- Can you row harder? - I am trying.

413
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:55,761
Why are you so bad at this?

414
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,221
This is so hard.

415
00:15:57,221 --> 00:16:00,291
- Come on. - Goodness.

416
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:03,421
- You're rowing too carelessly. - No, I'm not.

417
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,391
(Ji Hyo and Haha arrive.)

418
00:16:07,621 --> 00:16:10,561
The phone keeps ringing so much

419
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:14,361
That it might explode

420
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:18,821
I don't know, but he says he can't breathe

421
00:16:18,821 --> 00:16:23,191
I break his heart because I give him a hard time

422
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:26,161
It's a song by Twice.

423
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:28,461
(It's a song by Twice.)

424
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:30,891
("Cheer Up" by Twice)

425
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:35,391
(It's the biggest hit song in 2016 that made "Shy, shy, shy" popular.)

426
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:39,461
(Will Ji Hyo guess the correct answer?)

427
00:16:39,461 --> 00:16:41,461
I'm not bragging

428
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:45,521
I'm sorry for not answering the phone

429
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:47,921
I have no idea what it is.

430
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:51,061
(Finally, "Shy, shy, shy" is coming up.)

431
00:16:51,061 --> 00:16:53,121
Don't you know "Shy, shy, shy"?

432
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:55,121
Don't you know "Shy, shy, shy"?

433
00:16:57,161 --> 00:17:01,121
(If the lyrics include "Shy, shy, shy" and it's a song by Twice...)

434
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,191
- "Shy, Shy, Shy". - "Shy, Shy, Shy".

435
00:17:02,191 --> 00:17:03,291
("Shy, Shy, Shy" by Twice?)

436
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,491
Goodness.

437
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:07,361
- That's incorrect. - Don't you know the title?

438
00:17:07,421 --> 00:17:09,121
Don't you know this dance?

439
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:10,291
- Don't you know the song? - "Shy, Shy, Shy".

440
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,121
- Did you write "Shy, Shy, Shy"? - Yes.

441
00:17:12,121 --> 00:17:13,991
What's the title of the song?

442
00:17:14,461 --> 00:17:15,621
(Isn't "Shy, Shy, Shy" the title?)

443
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:18,191
- "Shy, Shy, Shy". - What's the chorus?

444
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:23,161
I'll show you more, cheer up, baby

445
00:17:23,731 --> 00:17:26,491
(They must recognize it by now.)

446
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:28,691
"Shut It, Baby".

447
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:30,421
"Shut It, Baby".

448
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:31,791
(What?)

449
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,991
("Shut It, Baby"?)

450
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:35,691
What kind of title is that?

451
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,591
- The chorus is "Cheer up, Baby". - "Shut It, Baby".

452
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:39,861
"Shut It, Baby"?

453
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:41,091
"Shut It, Baby".

454
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,521
Isn't this correct?

455
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:43,991
(Everyone is speechless.)

456
00:17:43,991 --> 00:17:45,391
Didn't you hear the chorus?

457
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:46,561
Wait a minute.

458
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:48,791
Would the beautiful girls say, "Shut it"?

459
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:50,891
Look over here.

460
00:17:51,161 --> 00:17:52,621
"Cheer Up" by Twice.

461
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:54,421
- Is it "Cheer Up"? - Of course it is.

462
00:17:55,091 --> 00:17:56,291
Seok Jin's answer is correct.

463
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,391
(Seok Jin answers correctly.)

464
00:17:59,261 --> 00:18:00,461
It's "Cheer Up".

465
00:18:00,461 --> 00:18:02,231
Right, it's "Cheer Up".

466
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:04,061
The boat is docked properly.

467
00:18:05,091 --> 00:18:06,421
Now,

468
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:08,891
Jong Kook and Kwang Soo earned 40R each.

469
00:18:09,821 --> 00:18:11,291
- We're on the lead. - I know.

470
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,591
- Seok Jin earned 10R. - I only earned 10R?

471
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:16,731
Good job, Ms. Shy, Shy, Shy.

472
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:18,921
You did a good job, too.

473
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:22,291
- Ms. Shy, Shy, Shy. - Mr. Shut It, Baby.

474
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:24,761
How could they think it was "Shy, Shy, Shy"?

475
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:30,291
(Current status of how many R coins each member has earned)

476
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:33,021
- What's this? - What's over here?

477
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:34,891
There are makeup tools.

478
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:38,291
- What are these? - What are they?

479
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,761
The second part of Probability Race...

480
00:18:41,231 --> 00:18:42,821
is in Hanok Village.

481
00:18:43,161 --> 00:18:46,461
You'll play "Secret Mission at Hanok Village".

482
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:47,521
"Secret Mission"?

483
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:49,691
("Secret Mission at Hanok Village")

484
00:18:49,691 --> 00:18:52,891
Without letting the public find out who you are,

485
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:54,991
you must clear the mission.

486
00:18:55,521 --> 00:18:59,261
(If someone says hello or calls out their name, they fail.)

487
00:18:59,261 --> 00:19:01,061
How can we remain discreet with a blonde wig?

488
00:19:01,991 --> 00:19:05,591
- I can wear anything. - The makeup will make us stand out.

489
00:19:05,591 --> 00:19:07,991
The worst is putting on your name tag.

490
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:12,061
- It's like a Halloween party. - Will you be together or apart?

491
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:20,621
(What will they choose to do this time?)

492
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:23,861
I can't be together with Kwang Soo. Let's be apart.

493
00:19:23,861 --> 00:19:26,021
We decide to be apart.

494
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,621
We should be apart this time.

495
00:19:27,621 --> 00:19:28,821
- It's because of Kwang Soo. - Wait.

496
00:19:28,821 --> 00:19:30,161
Kwang Soo stands out too much.

497
00:19:30,161 --> 00:19:32,591
- It'd be impossible with him. - He can't be discreet at all.

498
00:19:32,591 --> 00:19:34,521
People would recognize him even if he crawls.

499
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:36,491
Crawling wouldn't be any better.

500
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:38,261
It's too stressful to be with him in public.

501
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,991
Will you be apart?

502
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:41,461
- Yes. - We'll be apart.

503
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:42,791
- We have to be apart. - Then,

504
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,821
please choose the number of the ladder.

505
00:19:44,961 --> 00:19:46,961
Let's do the opposite this time. I'll take one.

506
00:19:46,961 --> 00:19:48,891
The hat and jacket are the best.

507
00:19:48,891 --> 00:19:51,061
- I choose two. - Let's start with Haha.

508
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:53,291
- Please. - It's Haha's turn.

509
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,561
In 1, 2, 3, 4.

510
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:59,861
(Will he get to cover himself or put on his name tag?)

511
00:19:59,861 --> 00:20:04,061
(Will he get to cover himself or put on his name tag?)

512
00:20:04,191 --> 00:20:06,361
- He gets Professional Makeup Card. - Go over there.

513
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:07,661
That's a good thing.

514
00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:09,091
Okay, this is great.

515
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:11,161
- Aren't hat and jacket the best? - Okay.

516
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,921
- It's my turn. - It's Ji Hyo's turn.

517
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,461
(Next up is Ji Hyo.)

518
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:22,491
(Will it be confirmed that Ji Hyo is truly lucky?)

519
00:20:22,491 --> 00:20:23,731
- Hat and jacket. - Hat and jacket.

520
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:26,061
- These are the best. - These are great.

521
00:20:26,061 --> 00:20:27,191
- They are. - Thank goodness.

522
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:28,521
Isn't Professional Makeup Card the best?

523
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:29,861
- Who's next? - Is it Jong Kook?

524
00:20:30,161 --> 00:20:31,791
No, my turn is before Kwang Soo's.

525
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,161
- Next up is Kwang Soo. - No.

526
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:35,421
- In 2, 3, 4, 5. - Isn't it Seok Jin's turn?

527
00:20:35,421 --> 00:20:37,821
Okay, this is my turn.

528
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,391
(Why did Seok Jin take Kwang Soo's turn instead?)

529
00:20:40,391 --> 00:20:41,561
It's Seok Jin.

530
00:20:41,861 --> 00:20:42,991
Put on your name tag.

531
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,291
(Put on your name tag)

532
00:20:45,091 --> 00:20:46,161
Put on your name tag.

533
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,661
He's so unlucky.

534
00:20:49,191 --> 00:20:50,961
It wasn't his turn originally.

535
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:52,391
How unlucky am I?

536
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:53,861
I shouldn't have changed my turn.

537
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:54,921
- Who's next? - It's Jae Seok.

538
00:20:55,761 --> 00:20:57,091
That's the worst.

539
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:58,691
- Let's see. - It's Jae Seok.

540
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:00,491
(Next up is Jae Seok.)

541
00:21:00,491 --> 00:21:01,591
You'll get the name tag, too.

542
00:21:01,591 --> 00:21:03,521
- Hat and jacket. - That's not bad.

543
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:04,561
That's much better.

544
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:07,391
- It's impossible to hide yourself. - I can cover up myself.

545
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,621
Only the name tag and Professional Makeup Card remain.

546
00:21:09,621 --> 00:21:10,661
Who's next?

547
00:21:10,891 --> 00:21:13,861
(It's between the name tag and Professional Makeup Card.)

548
00:21:13,861 --> 00:21:15,491
I wanted this ladder.

549
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:20,621
(Kwang Soo's fate depends on Jong Kook's choice.)

550
00:21:20,991 --> 00:21:22,861
(He wants to meet the professional makeup artist.)

551
00:21:23,421 --> 00:21:25,161
(He doesn't want the name tag.)

552
00:21:26,191 --> 00:21:27,561
It's Professional Makeup Card.

553
00:21:27,561 --> 00:21:28,891
That's crazy.

554
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,661
(That means...)

555
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:31,821
Put on your name tag.

556
00:21:31,821 --> 00:21:33,661
I didn't even get to choose.

557
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,761
Why did everyone else get to choose?

558
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,121
So 2 out of 3 were destined to put on the name tag.

559
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,461
- It's strange. - It's impossible.

560
00:21:40,461 --> 00:21:42,491
- It's very strange. - I can't put on my name tag.

561
00:21:42,491 --> 00:21:44,291
- It'd be impossible. - It's strange how it turned out.

562
00:21:44,391 --> 00:21:45,821
- I've been on the show for 7 years. - This isn't all.

563
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:47,361
(The three unlucky members are still unlucky.)

564
00:21:47,821 --> 00:21:51,821
(Professional Makeup Card, hat and jacket, name tag)

565
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:53,991
There are three locations for the mission.

566
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:57,291
Two members will be dropped off in each location.

567
00:21:57,521 --> 00:21:58,661
Which one is the worst location?

568
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:00,091
Please pair up.

569
00:22:00,091 --> 00:22:02,161
Pairing up with someone with the name tag won't be good.

570
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:04,221
- Is it random? - Let's find out.

571
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:05,361
(If your partner is found, you might be found.)

572
00:22:05,361 --> 00:22:06,461
Please take one.

573
00:22:07,461 --> 00:22:08,921
- Jeondong Cathedral? - Awesome.

574
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:11,021
- You and I have the same. - That's incredible.

575
00:22:11,091 --> 00:22:13,561
Who has "Pick a Fortune"?

576
00:22:14,061 --> 00:22:16,561
(Who is Jae Seok's partner?)

577
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:18,521
- I have "Pick a Fortune". - Is it him again?

578
00:22:19,621 --> 00:22:22,121
(Jae Seok is forever bound to Seok Jin.)

579
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:24,491
- Am I paired up with you? - Come on.

580
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:26,791
- Are you my partner? - How is this possible?

581
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:28,891
- We have our old partners. - We have the same partners.

582
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:31,121
- My goodness. - I can't do anything.

583
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:34,091
- We might be at an advantage. - I gave out the paper.

584
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:36,121
- You're so unlucky. - Did you notice that?

585
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:38,061
My partner is with his name tag.

586
00:22:38,061 --> 00:22:39,761
(They're both unlucky.)

587
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:42,361
I can't hide my name tag.

588
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,891
This team has the most advantage.

589
00:22:44,121 --> 00:22:46,591
(Locations for Probability Race)

590
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:51,161
You can put on the makeup any way you want.

591
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,761
What's the point? I'm with Kwang Soo.

592
00:22:54,461 --> 00:22:55,991
- My goodness. - Wait.

593
00:22:55,991 --> 00:22:57,121
- Goodness. - Gosh.

594
00:22:57,121 --> 00:22:58,921
- It's Jong Kook. - There's Jong Kook.

595
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:00,921
- Anyone would notice that it's him. - It's so obvious.

596
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,821
What's the point of putting on a costume?

597
00:23:02,821 --> 00:23:04,091
(How does Jong Kook look?)

598
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,391
(It's obviously Jong Kook.)

599
00:23:07,561 --> 00:23:09,161
Why is your skirt so wide?

600
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:10,621
(He's in a big costume.)

601
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:12,921
- You're obviously Jong Kook. - Everyone will recognize you.

602
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:14,261
I'm scared.

603
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:15,821
Is that a sideburn?

604
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:17,761
(He ignores his question.)

605
00:23:17,891 --> 00:23:19,161
Your big arms...

606
00:23:19,161 --> 00:23:21,291
don't fit in the hanbok.

607
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,991
The hanbok is too tight on you. It should be loose.

608
00:23:24,221 --> 00:23:25,691
This is funny.

609
00:23:26,191 --> 00:23:28,391
- Let's go. - All we have to do is...

610
00:23:28,391 --> 00:23:31,391
- buy some rice cake skewers, right? - Yes.

611
00:23:31,921 --> 00:23:33,091
- Stay calm. - All we have to do is buy them?

612
00:23:33,091 --> 00:23:34,961
- How many should we buy? - You must remain discreet.

613
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:36,921
- This isn't possible. - We need to buy rice cake skewers.

614
00:23:37,221 --> 00:23:38,621
Five rice cake skewers, please.

615
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:41,161
You stand out more than I do.

616
00:23:41,161 --> 00:23:43,161
- Hide your voice like this. - How?

617
00:23:43,561 --> 00:23:44,761
Excuse me.

618
00:23:45,421 --> 00:23:46,521
Excuse me.

619
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:49,791
- It's Jae Seok. - What are you doing?

620
00:23:50,191 --> 00:23:52,891
- Is that it? - It sounds like a voice mimicry.

621
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:54,691
- My voice doesn't stand out. - It sounds like you.

622
00:23:54,691 --> 00:23:56,221
- Is it obvious. - Sir?

623
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:57,921
Kwang Soo, say something in a different voice.

624
00:23:57,921 --> 00:24:01,361
Five rice cake skewers, please.

625
00:24:01,891 --> 00:24:03,961
Was it unrecognizable? I was surprised myself.

626
00:24:04,091 --> 00:24:06,391
- It's definitely Kwang Soo. - Five rice cake skewers, please.

627
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:09,191
(Will he successfully remain discreet?)

628
00:24:09,191 --> 00:24:10,221
Here we are.

629
00:24:12,191 --> 00:24:13,421
It's Hanok Village.

630
00:24:13,421 --> 00:24:18,291
(Hanok Village in Jeonju contains the beauty of Korea.)

631
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:20,821
- You walk here in hanbok. - There's another Eo Woo Dong.

632
00:24:20,821 --> 00:24:22,421
She's wearing the same costume as Jong Kook.

633
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:24,591
- Is there another Eo Woo Dong? - Yes.

634
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:26,621
Look.

635
00:24:26,991 --> 00:24:28,561
- There they are. - They're wearing costumes, too.

636
00:24:28,561 --> 00:24:31,161
- There are many in costumes. - You're right.

637
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:33,191
It's trendy these days.

638
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:35,791
They put on costumes together and go on a date.

639
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:37,691
There are many in costumes.

640
00:24:37,691 --> 00:24:42,591
(Hanok Village is full of people in hanbok.)

641
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:43,791
This is risky here.

642
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:45,291
- There are many. - Many are in costumes.

643
00:24:45,561 --> 00:24:47,361
Next up are Jong Kook and Kwang Soo.

644
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,491
Unfortunately, rice cake skewers shop is closed.

645
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:52,291
- Instead, - They should change the item.

646
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:55,591
you must buy shrimp dumplings from Joeun Dumplings.

647
00:24:55,591 --> 00:24:57,091
Buy six portions.

648
00:24:57,091 --> 00:24:59,261
I don't care how much we need to buy.

649
00:25:00,491 --> 00:25:01,661
I can buy 12 portions.

650
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:05,461
If you get caught, buy all 6. I'll buy only 3 portions.

651
00:25:06,661 --> 00:25:08,221
Here's the money for the dumplings.

652
00:25:08,221 --> 00:25:10,221
Kwang Soo, bring back a lot of delicious food.

653
00:25:10,221 --> 00:25:11,491
I'll clear the mission first.

654
00:25:11,491 --> 00:25:12,921
Bring back the dumplings.

655
00:25:12,921 --> 00:25:14,721
Do we get 3 or 4 portions?

656
00:25:16,691 --> 00:25:20,261
(He tries to hide himself with his hoodie.)

657
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:25,761
- Which dumpling shop is it? - Joeun Dumplings.

658
00:25:26,821 --> 00:25:29,621
This is the way to the shop.

659
00:25:29,891 --> 00:25:32,121
- Go this way. - Will we see it on the street?

660
00:25:32,221 --> 00:25:33,561
Yes, go out this way.

661
00:25:36,961 --> 00:25:39,691
(Hanok Village gets more crowded because it's lunch time.)

662
00:25:39,691 --> 00:25:41,521
- We start after the corner. - What?

663
00:25:41,521 --> 00:25:43,561
- We start after the corner. - Just go.

664
00:25:43,561 --> 00:25:48,491
(After a few steps is a street crowded with people.)

665
00:25:48,491 --> 00:25:49,661
Go on.

666
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:51,391
(After a few steps is a street crowded with people.)

667
00:25:53,091 --> 00:25:55,491
(He's too scared to go.)

668
00:25:56,691 --> 00:25:58,291
What is he doing?

669
00:25:59,421 --> 00:26:04,291
(He squats down when there's nobody watching him.)

670
00:26:04,991 --> 00:26:06,821
(He's close to the wall.)

671
00:26:09,461 --> 00:26:14,761
(Jong Kook moves ahead with his face hidden.)

672
00:26:18,261 --> 00:26:20,721
(He looks suspicious with his face covered.)

673
00:26:22,921 --> 00:26:24,121
(Kwang Soo rises.)

674
00:26:24,391 --> 00:26:26,391
(He starts walking fast.)

675
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:27,561
Where did Jong Kook go?

676
00:26:29,061 --> 00:26:30,361
There are too many people here.

677
00:26:30,361 --> 00:26:32,291
(What is that young man doing?)

678
00:26:33,121 --> 00:26:35,061
(Glancing)

679
00:26:37,191 --> 00:26:40,291
(He must be in a hurry.)

680
00:26:40,991 --> 00:26:42,991
(Please)

681
00:26:44,261 --> 00:26:46,491
(Why is he walking like that?)

682
00:26:47,421 --> 00:26:53,691
(He passes a crowded street with people staring at him.)

683
00:26:54,491 --> 00:26:57,621
(Jong Kook strides ahead easily with his costume.)

684
00:26:58,261 --> 00:27:02,761
(That's a good looking costume.)

685
00:27:03,191 --> 00:27:04,391
(Peeking)

686
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:06,991
(Scrambling)

687
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:09,291
I might make it.

688
00:27:11,861 --> 00:27:13,791
(There are people at the end of the street.)

689
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:14,961
Where is it?

690
00:27:15,921 --> 00:27:18,421
(Jong Kook is closely behind him.)

691
00:27:18,621 --> 00:27:19,821
Where is it?

692
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:21,021
(He passes easily.)

693
00:27:21,721 --> 00:27:23,391
They didn't recognize me.

694
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:28,091
(The dumpling restaurant is right around the corner.)

695
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:30,961
(Spinning)

696
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:32,821
There are people here.

697
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:37,221
(He pretends like he's a statue.)

698
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:43,661
(He finally arrives at the dumpling restaurant.)

699
00:27:44,061 --> 00:27:45,621
(A group of young students approach him.)

700
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:49,891
(It should be okay as long as they don't see my back.)

701
00:27:50,561 --> 00:27:55,261
(He's only a few steps away.)

702
00:27:56,361 --> 00:27:58,861
(Is Kwang Soo already there?)

703
00:27:59,661 --> 00:28:04,061
(Would Kwang Soo make it?)

704
00:28:04,061 --> 00:28:05,461
May I have six servings of dumplings?

705
00:28:05,491 --> 00:28:07,161
(He changes his voice.)

706
00:28:07,161 --> 00:28:09,761
(But the dumpling restaurant is the place on the right.)

707
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:13,021
(We sell rice cakes.)

708
00:28:14,621 --> 00:28:16,121
(This is not it.)

709
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:17,291
Hello, Kwang Soo.

710
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:20,961
- Sorry? - Are you filming?

711
00:28:21,261 --> 00:28:22,421
Would you like me to get you some?

712
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:24,561
Would you like some dumplings?

713
00:28:24,561 --> 00:28:25,761
- What is he doing? - Sure.

714
00:28:26,461 --> 00:28:29,391
(Jong Kook approaches the dumpling restaurant.)

715
00:28:30,121 --> 00:28:31,361
(Kwang Soo, that's a fail.)

716
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:33,121
(Hold on.)

717
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:35,921
May I have three servings of dumplings?

718
00:28:36,721 --> 00:28:38,461
Three servings, please.

719
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:40,391
- Three servings? - Yes.

720
00:28:40,861 --> 00:28:42,291
Oh, my goodness.

721
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:45,291
- My goodness. - Do you want me to take it?

722
00:28:46,661 --> 00:28:49,591
(People are focused on Kwang Soo.)

723
00:28:49,591 --> 00:28:55,621
(All Jong Kook has to do is leave with the dumplings.)

724
00:28:55,621 --> 00:28:57,291
Do you mind taking a picture for us?

725
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:59,221
(Do you mind taking a picture for us?)

726
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:05,421
(How dare you, Kwang Soo?)

727
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:08,491
Are you Kim Jong Kook?

728
00:29:08,961 --> 00:29:10,091
It's him.

729
00:29:10,091 --> 00:29:11,561
(It is me.)

730
00:29:11,561 --> 00:29:12,761
Thank you.

731
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:16,091
(We need to talk, Kwang Soo.)

732
00:29:16,091 --> 00:29:17,661
What are you doing?

733
00:29:18,561 --> 00:29:20,091
(He gets slapped.)

734
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,861
- Who is this guy? - Hey.

735
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,461
- Hey. I did all this for nothing. - What?

736
00:29:25,461 --> 00:29:26,661
Who is this guy?

737
00:29:27,191 --> 00:29:28,891
- It's not my fault. - It's your fault.

738
00:29:28,891 --> 00:29:30,691
Hold on. It wasn't...

739
00:29:30,691 --> 00:29:32,391
- It's not my fault. - It's your fault.

740
00:29:32,391 --> 00:29:35,091
Hold on. It wasn't because of me, right?

741
00:29:35,091 --> 00:29:37,191
You didn't notice him because of me, right?

742
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:38,291
I did.

743
00:29:38,521 --> 00:29:40,391
You punk.

744
00:29:41,991 --> 00:29:42,991
(Jong Kook is mad.)

745
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:45,661
I'm mad. I'm so mad.

746
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:48,661
(What was the mission?)

747
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:49,991
I was supposed to come unnoticed and buy something.

748
00:29:50,261 --> 00:29:52,421
- We can see your name tag. - How could you not be noticed?

749
00:29:52,461 --> 00:29:54,361
I don't know. I got unlucky.

750
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:55,591
(How could you be unnoticed with this on your back?)

751
00:29:57,221 --> 00:29:59,921
- What happened? - He failed. He took his hat off.

752
00:29:59,991 --> 00:30:01,821
- What happened? - Why didn't you get something?

753
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:03,961
- What happened? - I was...

754
00:30:03,961 --> 00:30:05,791
ordering quietly,

755
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:07,791
and Kwang Soo was taking pictures with people.

756
00:30:07,791 --> 00:30:09,961
He approached me and told me to take pictures for him.

757
00:30:10,491 --> 00:30:12,721
- Kwang Soo did? - You were close.

758
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:15,921
- Were you almost finished? - He has a lot of problems.

759
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:17,861
I agree. He has problems.

760
00:30:17,991 --> 00:30:21,391
Thanks to you, I failed. I failed the mission.

761
00:30:21,761 --> 00:30:25,261
(You're handsome.)

762
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:26,521
Thank you.

763
00:30:26,521 --> 00:30:29,491
(Me? I know I look quite good.)

764
00:30:30,021 --> 00:30:31,091
Thank you.

765
00:30:31,091 --> 00:30:33,921
(All right, then.)

766
00:30:34,761 --> 00:30:37,921
(You can take your time.)

767
00:30:38,721 --> 00:30:42,061
(People gather around the dumpling restaurant to look at him.)

768
00:30:42,461 --> 00:30:50,461
(I may not have won, but it's fine as long as my fans smile.)

769
00:30:51,091 --> 00:30:53,621
I'm mad. I'm so mad.

770
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:57,861
Thanks to you, I failed. I failed the mission.

771
00:30:57,861 --> 00:31:01,291
(I didn't get any dumplings but I am a lucky guy.)

772
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:04,361
Thank you. Thank you for the food.

773
00:31:04,461 --> 00:31:05,621
Thank you.

774
00:31:05,691 --> 00:31:07,961
- I'm back. - Kwang Soo, you're back.

775
00:31:08,261 --> 00:31:10,821
Jong Kook. Hold on, you're mistaken.

776
00:31:11,461 --> 00:31:13,991
I merely asked you to take a picture for me.

777
00:31:14,461 --> 00:31:16,821
- Have a seat, Kwang Soo. - You went too far.

778
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:17,921
No, that's not it.

779
00:31:18,221 --> 00:31:20,661
- Let's try these first. - Is it good?

780
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:21,991
(They decide to taste the dumplings first.)

781
00:31:21,991 --> 00:31:23,721
- It has an entire shrimp in it. - These are shrimp dumplings.

782
00:31:23,721 --> 00:31:25,591
- It's mine. - Give me some.

783
00:31:25,721 --> 00:31:27,461
They have shrimps in them.

784
00:31:27,861 --> 00:31:29,191
This is so good.

785
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:31,661
(They decide to eat first.)

786
00:31:31,661 --> 00:31:33,061
This is good.

787
00:31:33,121 --> 00:31:36,421
- They're the same. - This is tasty. The sauce is good.

788
00:31:36,991 --> 00:31:38,661
Anyhow, both of them have failed, right?

789
00:31:39,121 --> 00:31:41,761
Okay!

790
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:44,121
I should stick with Jae Seok.

791
00:31:44,561 --> 00:31:46,221
- That's a good idea. - Right?

792
00:31:46,561 --> 00:31:48,491
Watch me.

793
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:51,291
I'll show you how a professional does it.

794
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:53,521
What kind of a professional is that?

795
00:31:53,521 --> 00:31:55,421
- What is that? - How is that useful?

796
00:31:55,521 --> 00:31:57,191
- Didn't you know? - You must be a thief.

797
00:31:57,191 --> 00:31:58,991
I have two jobs.

798
00:31:58,991 --> 00:32:01,891
- What are they? - I'm a celebrity and an agent.

799
00:32:01,891 --> 00:32:03,121
(He's a celebrity and a secret agent.)

800
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:06,521
You had no idea, right? I collect your information...

801
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:07,961
I collect your information...

802
00:32:08,091 --> 00:32:09,821
- That was so random. - I was hiding my identity.

803
00:32:09,821 --> 00:32:12,561
I was shocked when I watched "Jason Bourne".

804
00:32:12,561 --> 00:32:13,991
I thought they were talking about me.

805
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:18,661
(Forget about the celebrity Jae Seok. He's Jae Seok Bourne.)

806
00:32:18,661 --> 00:32:20,121
- Did you have no idea? - I had no idea.

807
00:32:20,121 --> 00:32:21,361
- You didn't? - What kind of things did you do?

808
00:32:21,361 --> 00:32:22,421
You might not know...

809
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:25,521
Tell me something that made headlines on the news.

810
00:32:25,521 --> 00:32:27,091
This didn't make headlines...

811
00:32:27,091 --> 00:32:29,721
but I passed on Seok Jin's personal information once.

812
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:31,991
(That's a big deal.)

813
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:35,391
My wife knew what I was doing.

814
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:37,391
- Plus... - I told her.

815
00:32:37,521 --> 00:32:39,721
- You almost had me. - I knew.

816
00:32:40,061 --> 00:32:42,091
- Is it me next? - Get ready.

817
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:44,661
- Yes. - Agent Yu.

818
00:32:44,661 --> 00:32:46,961
- Give us some information. - Don't you worry.

819
00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:48,421
- Jae Seok is too noticeable. - I agree.

820
00:32:48,421 --> 00:32:50,361
- You're too noticeable. - You are.

821
00:32:50,561 --> 00:32:52,261
He can't be a secret agent.

822
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:55,061
(Jae Seok is easily noticeable and Seok Jin has a name tag on him.)

823
00:32:55,061 --> 00:32:57,191
- Where are we supposed to go? - Where is it?

824
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:59,121
Look.

825
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,391
People can see you like that.

826
00:33:03,121 --> 00:33:04,361
People can see you.

827
00:33:04,361 --> 00:33:09,491
(You must pick your fortune and return without being noticed.)

828
00:33:09,491 --> 00:33:11,191
I usually don't avoid people.

829
00:33:11,861 --> 00:33:16,261
(Jae Seok Bourne is out on the street.)

830
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:17,361
Where is it?

831
00:33:17,361 --> 00:33:18,421
(Jae Seok Bourne is out on the street.)

832
00:33:18,421 --> 00:33:19,491
Where is it?

833
00:33:20,421 --> 00:33:23,361
(There are a lot of people on the streets.)

834
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:24,961
Where's my destination?

835
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:28,691
(He'll make eye contact with people as soon as he turns his head.)

836
00:33:29,491 --> 00:33:30,621
(He turns away.)

837
00:33:36,121 --> 00:33:40,021
(He turns away and avoids making eye contact.)

838
00:33:40,661 --> 00:33:44,461
(Here's a map.)

839
00:33:45,361 --> 00:33:48,621
(He uses it to cover his face.)

840
00:33:48,621 --> 00:33:52,161
Is that it? There are quite a few people.

841
00:33:54,861 --> 00:33:58,091
(A person in a costume looks in his direction.)

842
00:33:58,091 --> 00:34:02,361
(But he's a secret agent and he escapes suspicion.)

843
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:05,461
We're not noticeable.

844
00:34:05,631 --> 00:34:06,661
(He walks fearlessly.)

845
00:34:07,191 --> 00:34:10,161
(He's almost at his destination.)

846
00:34:10,561 --> 00:34:12,361
Where is it? Where's the place?

847
00:34:12,361 --> 00:34:14,291
(Meanwhile, Seok Jin is lost.)

848
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:16,921
This is the biggest challenge.

849
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:19,191
This is the biggest challenge. There's a lot of people.

850
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:20,631
I'm going to run.

851
00:34:20,921 --> 00:34:22,761
(Sprinting)

852
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:28,091
(He sprints when there's nobody around.)

853
00:34:29,261 --> 00:34:31,091
(He conceals his name tag.)

854
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,461
(People don't even pay attention to him.)

855
00:34:36,021 --> 00:34:39,991
(Are they pretending not to recognize me?)

856
00:34:41,021 --> 00:34:43,761
(Jae Seok arrives at his destination.)

857
00:34:45,361 --> 00:34:46,691
My gosh.

858
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:48,591
What's wrong?

859
00:34:49,191 --> 00:34:53,921
(It's getting more crowded.)

860
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:59,821
Jae Seok, I think I can make it.

861
00:35:02,131 --> 00:35:03,161
Seok Jin.

862
00:35:03,161 --> 00:35:04,391
(People are gathered.)

863
00:35:04,391 --> 00:35:05,591
How does this work?

864
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:08,261
(He puts in a coin.)

865
00:35:09,821 --> 00:35:14,391
(He receives his fortune.)

866
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:19,291
(Jae Seok clears the mission.)

867
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:22,221
I don't have a good feeling about this.

868
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:25,991
How much is it?

869
00:35:26,861 --> 00:35:30,591
(Seok Jin tries to get Jae Seok to talk.)

870
00:35:35,061 --> 00:35:38,421
(Here's somebody from Running Man.)

871
00:35:38,891 --> 00:35:42,861
(Jae Seok runs away after exposing Seok Jin.)

872
00:35:43,691 --> 00:35:46,561
(It's Running Man.)

873
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,721
Hello.

874
00:35:48,691 --> 00:35:51,661
(He's so popular today.)

875
00:35:52,661 --> 00:35:55,921
I'm so mad. I almost had it.

876
00:35:56,961 --> 00:35:58,661
I tried so hard.

877
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,131
Really? Hello.

878
00:36:01,131 --> 00:36:02,591
(He comes back with a fan club.)

879
00:36:02,591 --> 00:36:03,691
Thank you.

880
00:36:03,691 --> 00:36:05,791
(He gathers his fans.)

881
00:36:08,461 --> 00:36:11,561
(That annoying Jae Seok cost me my failure.)

882
00:36:11,991 --> 00:36:14,461
People recognized him, right?

883
00:36:14,461 --> 00:36:16,761
(It's so fun to betray Seok Jin.)

884
00:36:17,991 --> 00:36:20,791
I'll succeed if I make it back to the car without being recognized.

885
00:36:21,761 --> 00:36:23,021
Where is the bus?

886
00:36:24,361 --> 00:36:27,631
(His weakness is his poor sense of direction.)

887
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:29,221
(He looks around.)

888
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:33,421
(Their eyes meet.)

889
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:35,961
Goodness.

890
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:36,961
(Please, pretend to not recognize me.)

891
00:36:39,521 --> 00:36:41,521
(You are Jae Seok, aren't you?)

892
00:36:41,631 --> 00:36:43,361
I mean I can't find the bus.

893
00:36:43,691 --> 00:36:45,291
- Anyway, - Can we take a photo together?

894
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:46,521
This shouldn't...

895
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:48,631
This shouldn't have happened.

896
00:36:49,021 --> 00:36:52,821
I was looking for the bus and our eyes met.

897
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:55,821
- Hold on. - It's Jae Seok.

898
00:36:56,791 --> 00:36:59,361
I was merely looking for the bus and our eyes met.

899
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:01,491
- My name tag got pulled out. - But...

900
00:37:02,091 --> 00:37:04,221
- I was searching for the bus. - Hey.

901
00:37:04,221 --> 00:37:05,521
Why did you do that for?

902
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:07,131
- You betrayed me. - I mean,

903
00:37:07,131 --> 00:37:09,021
this should count as a success.

904
00:37:09,091 --> 00:37:11,261
- I was so close. - I couldn't find the bus.

905
00:37:11,461 --> 00:37:13,791
That's the only reason our eyes met.

906
00:37:14,461 --> 00:37:16,421
- Over there. - This is driving me crazy.

907
00:37:16,421 --> 00:37:17,721
It's making me angry.

908
00:37:17,721 --> 00:37:19,391
(It's all your fault, Jae Seok.)

909
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:22,991
- So both of them failed. - They failed.

910
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,061
Yes, they did.

911
00:37:24,921 --> 00:37:27,091
- Did you picked your fortune? - Yes.

912
00:37:27,261 --> 00:37:29,191
- What does it say? - How's your fortune?

913
00:37:29,361 --> 00:37:30,921
"You'll have good fortunes."

914
00:37:30,921 --> 00:37:34,361
"You'll have a comfortable life."

915
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:38,291
"You will have an abundance of food and wealth."

916
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:41,461
"Mostly, you'll spend the upcoming year without any difficulties."

917
00:37:41,631 --> 00:37:44,921
"If you head north, it'll bring you riches."

918
00:37:45,191 --> 00:37:49,391
"Instead of keeping old things, it's better if you move to a new house."

919
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:52,391
"You'll receive a lot of support in the midst of good fortunes."

920
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:56,091
What a nice fortune.

921
00:37:56,091 --> 00:37:57,461
There's not a single misfortune mentioned.

922
00:37:57,461 --> 00:37:59,631
- You have a good fortune. - Yes, he does.

923
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:02,131
Of course, they wouldn't write something bad in it.

924
00:38:02,391 --> 00:38:06,421
- They won't write a misfortune. - "Your grandchild will be unlucky."

925
00:38:06,421 --> 00:38:08,391
- "Be careful at night." - That makes sense.

926
00:38:08,521 --> 00:38:09,521
I apologize.

927
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:10,761
(It won't feel great reading a bad fortune.)

928
00:38:10,761 --> 00:38:15,631
(Current score of collecting R coins)

929
00:38:16,591 --> 00:38:19,991
(A highlight of a trip to Jeonju is having a Korean traditional meal.)

930
00:38:19,991 --> 00:38:21,661
- Look at this. - What is all this?

931
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:23,661
- This looks amazing. - I have to eat this.

932
00:38:23,661 --> 00:38:24,991
Goodness!

933
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:26,861
(Jeonju brings the best authentic Korean food to the table.)

934
00:38:27,521 --> 00:38:29,521
I have to eat this. I wouldn't have it any other way.

935
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:31,191
- What is this? - Hold on.

936
00:38:31,191 --> 00:38:32,821
This has gotten me all worked up.

937
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,661
- This time, it'll be a food tour. - I must eat it.

938
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:37,761
- This looks so delicious. - I have to try this.

939
00:38:37,761 --> 00:38:41,261
We prepared three kinds of meals to keep up with Jeonju's reputation.

940
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:42,631
- It looks very tasty. - I'm going to eat this.

941
00:38:42,631 --> 00:38:45,061
- This is driving me crazy. - The first one will have...

942
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:48,861
- tteokgalbi, seasoned raw beef... - This is amazing.

943
00:38:48,991 --> 00:38:51,221
- All these are included? - This is incredible.

944
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:52,991
Look at how fat the octopus is.

945
00:38:52,991 --> 00:38:55,161
The next one will only get you one spoonful of food.

946
00:38:55,591 --> 00:38:59,491
You can put as much food as you want in one spoon.

947
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:02,921
The last one is a special rice ball made by the staff.

948
00:39:03,061 --> 00:39:06,821
We put healthy herbs like thistle bitter gourd and motherwort.

949
00:39:06,821 --> 00:39:08,361
This is a punishment.

950
00:39:08,461 --> 00:39:10,491
- They're all healthy for you. - This is a punishment.

951
00:39:10,491 --> 00:39:12,261
(We can take care of our own wellbeing.)

952
00:39:12,261 --> 00:39:14,221
- But it must be healthy. - If we eat that...

953
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:15,761
I think we might become immortal.

954
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,591
- The second one gets me a spoon. - You want to be together or apart?

955
00:39:18,591 --> 00:39:20,921
- Let's stay together. - Let's be together.

956
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:22,091
- Do you want to be together. - Let's stay together.

957
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:23,191
Let's start the game right away.

958
00:39:23,191 --> 00:39:24,861
- Let's split this time. - I want us to be together.

959
00:39:24,861 --> 00:39:27,361
If we do, some people are bound to have this meal.

960
00:39:27,691 --> 00:39:29,521
- Anyone can. - Then how about this?

961
00:39:29,761 --> 00:39:32,221
- I think Jong Kook makes sense. - Yes, some people ought to eat it.

962
00:39:32,221 --> 00:39:34,421
- It's better if some of us eat. - Exactly.

963
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:36,661
- Ji Hyo, which one? - This is strange.

964
00:39:36,661 --> 00:39:38,221
- Will we choose it beforehand? - Yes.

965
00:39:38,361 --> 00:39:39,521
Ji Hyo, which number do you want?

966
00:39:39,521 --> 00:39:41,261
- I'll choose number 5. - Okay, 5th one it is.

967
00:39:41,461 --> 00:39:44,591
- This is nerve-wrecking. - I'm so nervous.

968
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:48,291
- This is driving me crazy. - I didn't eat the meal in Icheon.

969
00:39:48,961 --> 00:39:52,761
(It's the meal of Jeonju that no one can refuse.)

970
00:39:52,761 --> 00:39:53,891
Please.

971
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,721
- Please. - I hope she gets the second course.

972
00:39:56,721 --> 00:39:59,161
- I beg you, please. - Get the second course.

973
00:39:59,161 --> 00:40:00,421
- I hope she gets the rice ball. - Please.

974
00:40:00,421 --> 00:40:02,021
Please, I beg you!

975
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:07,691
(Which food has Ji Hyo picked?)

976
00:40:07,761 --> 00:40:09,291
(It's the special rice ball made by the staff.)

977
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:10,631
- Please. - Please be the second course.

978
00:40:10,631 --> 00:40:13,821
(She gets the healthy rice ball filled with medicinal herbs.)

979
00:40:15,491 --> 00:40:18,191
(Her misery is happiness for everyone else.)

980
00:40:18,191 --> 00:40:19,691
- Great. - It's fine as long as it's not me.

981
00:40:19,861 --> 00:40:21,921
- This is great. - I'm glad it's not me.

982
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:23,261
I'm sorry for you, Ji Hyo.

983
00:40:23,361 --> 00:40:25,291
- You can't be lucky all the time. - Right.

984
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:26,721
- Have the rice ball. - You know it's a punishment, right?

985
00:40:26,721 --> 00:40:27,991
How about you, Jong Kook?

986
00:40:27,991 --> 00:40:29,161
- I choose the 2nd one. - He chose the 2nd one.

987
00:40:29,161 --> 00:40:30,721
- I think it's a lucky number. - I hope he gets the rice ball.

988
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:32,191
- Please get the rice ball. - Get the rice ball.

989
00:40:32,191 --> 00:40:36,161
- Get the rice ball. - Get the rice ball.

990
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:38,361
- Get the rice ball. - No way.

991
00:40:38,361 --> 00:40:42,061
(There are still two vacancies left for the meal. Will he get one?)

992
00:40:42,891 --> 00:40:45,091
(Get the rice ball for your health.)

993
00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:47,631
(What is the result of the second leg?)

994
00:40:47,631 --> 00:40:49,261
(He gets one spoonful of food.)

995
00:40:49,861 --> 00:40:51,721
(Everyone has united for the same purpose.)

996
00:40:53,131 --> 00:40:54,521
This is too harsh.

997
00:40:54,521 --> 00:40:56,491
- How many people are left? - Please.

998
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:58,521
Two of us will have the meal and the other won't.

999
00:40:58,521 --> 00:41:00,221
Yes, two of you will get the meal.

1000
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:02,661
- Please. - I can't believe my luck.

1001
00:41:02,661 --> 00:41:03,921
Who's next? I really want this meal.

1002
00:41:03,921 --> 00:41:05,691
Two of us will be lucky and the other two will be unlucky.

1003
00:41:06,261 --> 00:41:08,661
- I need to eat this meal. - All I want is this meal.

1004
00:41:08,821 --> 00:41:10,791
- I deserve this meal. - You saw what happened to me today.

1005
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:12,291
- Which number? - Get the rice ball.

1006
00:41:12,491 --> 00:41:14,591
- I'll choose lucky number... - Four!

1007
00:41:14,591 --> 00:41:16,161
- five. - That one's already done.

1008
00:41:16,461 --> 00:41:18,631
- We did? - Ji Hyo picked it.

1009
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:21,221
(He again picks the wrong number.)

1010
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:22,561
I almost got the rice ball..

1011
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:24,521
(Join me for a rice ball.)

1012
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:27,131
You saw that, right? If she didn't go before me, I would've gotten it.

1013
00:41:27,261 --> 00:41:29,021
- Which will it be, Jae Seok? - I'll pick lucky number...

1014
00:41:29,021 --> 00:41:30,461
- Choose 4. - Pick 4.

1015
00:41:30,461 --> 00:41:33,061
- I'll choose four! - Don't tell him what to pick.

1016
00:41:33,061 --> 00:41:34,161
- No. - Don't influence him.

1017
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:35,391
(Stop it.)

1018
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:37,421
I pick number six!

1019
00:41:37,721 --> 00:41:39,761
- You want the 6th one? - I'll choose the 4th one, then.

1020
00:41:39,761 --> 00:41:42,791
(He changed his number. Will it be a great move for him?)

1021
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:43,921
(I have a good feeling about this.)

1022
00:41:46,091 --> 00:41:47,091
- Okay. - Here you go.

1023
00:41:47,091 --> 00:41:49,521
- Please be the rice ball. - Get the rice ball.

1024
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:51,761
Get the rice ball. What is it?

1025
00:41:51,761 --> 00:41:52,791
Jae Seok.

1026
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:54,521
- What is it? - Is it the first meal?

1027
00:41:54,691 --> 00:41:56,021
- Did he get lucky or not? - Really?

1028
00:41:56,961 --> 00:41:59,021
- Let me see. - Is it the first meal?

1029
00:41:59,021 --> 00:42:00,131
In 1, 2, 3.

1030
00:42:01,921 --> 00:42:07,191
(Will this unlucky man's fate take a turn?)

1031
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,521
(He gets the meal of Jeonju.)

1032
00:42:09,661 --> 00:42:11,721
(An extraordinary event occurred.)

1033
00:42:11,721 --> 00:42:12,821
I'm so annoyed.

1034
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,631
- We shouldn't have let him change. - What's wrong with him?

1035
00:42:16,591 --> 00:42:19,291
(I got the meal of Jeonju!)

1036
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:20,591
- Now there's only one seat left. - I'm sorry.

1037
00:42:20,591 --> 00:42:22,131
(He's embarrassed.)

1038
00:42:22,921 --> 00:42:25,521
(He yelled loudly at such a peaceful place.)

1039
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:26,761
What's the matter with you?

1040
00:42:26,761 --> 00:42:27,791
(Is this your first time having a proper meal?)

1041
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:28,861
Don't rub it.

1042
00:42:28,861 --> 00:42:29,961
(He's feeling embarrassed.)

1043
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:31,291
- He picked the 6th one, right? - I'll choose the 3rd one.

1044
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:32,721
- I should've picked that one. - Did you pick the third one?

1045
00:42:32,721 --> 00:42:34,521
- Yes, I'll go with that one. - Please.

1046
00:42:34,521 --> 00:42:35,861
Kwang Soo, choose the first one.

1047
00:42:35,861 --> 00:42:37,721
(They are curious about the outcome.)

1048
00:42:38,221 --> 00:42:40,361
Please, there's still one more seat left.

1049
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:43,091
There's one more left.

1050
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:44,521
I still have a shot at it.

1051
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:46,161
- He might get it. - Please get the rice ball.

1052
00:42:46,161 --> 00:42:47,521
- Please. - It can't be the meal.

1053
00:42:47,821 --> 00:42:49,361
Please be the meal.

1054
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:51,091
- It's long. - Peel it.

1055
00:42:51,221 --> 00:42:52,461
The writing is really long, Seok Jin.

1056
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:54,261
- He might get lucky. - In 1, 2, 3.

1057
00:42:54,421 --> 00:42:57,161
(She said the writing was long. Could it be that he got the meal?)

1058
00:42:57,161 --> 00:43:00,991
(Will he get the meal of Jeonju?)

1059
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:04,091
(Or will he get the special rice ball made by the staff?)

1060
00:43:09,091 --> 00:43:11,291
(They shout for joy.)

1061
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:13,691
(He gets the special rice ball.)

1062
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:18,761
(He breaks his own record of being the unlucky one out of them.)

1063
00:43:18,761 --> 00:43:22,291
- How can I be this unlucky? - I will have the last number.

1064
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:23,421
How is this possible?

1065
00:43:23,421 --> 00:43:25,391
- Again, two of us are unlucky. - That's right.

1066
00:43:25,391 --> 00:43:26,591
Please.

1067
00:43:27,191 --> 00:43:28,521
- Should I go with the 1st one? - Yes, get the 1st one.

1068
00:43:29,391 --> 00:43:30,491
(Trust me.)

1069
00:43:30,491 --> 00:43:31,791
- I'll get the 1st one. - Kwang Soo, you want the 1st one?

1070
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:32,791
I'm sure it's the right number.

1071
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:34,991
(When he's not sure, it's better to listen to Jong Kook.)

1072
00:43:35,921 --> 00:43:38,421
(The busybodies of the town gather around him.)

1073
00:43:38,421 --> 00:43:40,121
- Here it is. - It ends up in the first slot.

1074
00:43:40,461 --> 00:43:41,621
Please let me have the meal.

1075
00:43:42,421 --> 00:43:43,421
Kwang Soo.

1076
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:44,961
- This was Kwang Soo's. - It is?

1077
00:43:46,161 --> 00:43:47,191
Kwang Soo.

1078
00:43:48,721 --> 00:43:51,921
(I can't wait to try tteokgalbi and seasoned raw beef.)

1079
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:54,861
(For the last 7 years, he was teased for being so unlucky.)

1080
00:43:54,861 --> 00:43:59,461
(Starting today, I will escape this curse alongside Jae Seok.)

1081
00:44:00,461 --> 00:44:07,021
(He is so close to having the meal. Will he get the meal or the spoon?)

1082
00:44:07,021 --> 00:44:08,461
Congratulations, Kwang Soo.

1083
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:13,491
(There were no surprises.)

1084
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:16,461
I guess only one of us will be lucky.

1085
00:44:16,961 --> 00:44:18,291
I really wanted the meal.

1086
00:44:18,721 --> 00:44:20,821
- Ji Hyo got the rice ball. - This is amazing.

1087
00:44:20,821 --> 00:44:22,061
(Jae Sook and Haha get the meal.)

1088
00:44:22,061 --> 00:44:23,891
(Ji Hyo and Seok Jin get the rice ball.)

1089
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,421
I can put as much food as I want.

1090
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,791
(They can't stop laughing and cheering.)

1091
00:44:29,091 --> 00:44:31,191
This looks amazing. You can just leave us two pieces of that.

1092
00:44:31,191 --> 00:44:34,491
(It's a shame to only have this special meal of Jeonju once.)

1093
00:44:34,491 --> 00:44:35,661
This is delicious.

1094
00:44:35,761 --> 00:44:38,591
(They seem as if they're promoting the meal.)

1095
00:44:38,591 --> 00:44:40,721
- This is incredible. - Bulgogi in the pot is awesome.

1096
00:44:41,821 --> 00:44:44,591
Look at the color of the rice ball.

1097
00:44:45,591 --> 00:44:47,621
- We put red ginseng extract in it. - I can smell it.

1098
00:44:47,621 --> 00:44:49,291
Look at the color of rice inside.

1099
00:44:49,691 --> 00:44:51,691
What is this? How can you call this rice?

1100
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:56,791
Kwang Soo, have tteokgalbi and seasoned raw beef.

1101
00:44:57,291 --> 00:44:59,591
- Why is the rice so bitter? - Isn't the squid good, too?

1102
00:45:00,361 --> 00:45:01,591
(Life of immortality tastes bitter.)

1103
00:45:01,591 --> 00:45:03,591
I'll try bibimbap.

1104
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:05,591
Should I have it like that? I think I should.

1105
00:45:06,091 --> 00:45:07,591
Jong Kook, are you sure that's a spoonful?

1106
00:45:09,421 --> 00:45:11,721
(He concentrates on having a big spoonful of food.)

1107
00:45:11,721 --> 00:45:12,891
I can eat it like this, right?

1108
00:45:13,721 --> 00:45:15,821
- Can you eat it at once? - That's almost 600g.

1109
00:45:16,421 --> 00:45:18,721
- That's 600g. - You're eating a whole cow.

1110
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:25,391
(He opens his mouth wide.)

1111
00:45:25,391 --> 00:45:27,091
- Can he eat it all? - Seriously?

1112
00:45:28,091 --> 00:45:30,561
You just devoured a whole cow.

1113
00:45:31,421 --> 00:45:32,891
Are you bleeding?

1114
00:45:34,021 --> 00:45:35,161
That was a lot.

1115
00:45:36,091 --> 00:45:37,361
But it's really delicious.

1116
00:45:39,221 --> 00:45:40,291
Gosh, it's so bitter.

1117
00:45:40,891 --> 00:45:42,061
Goodness, this is amazing.

1118
00:45:42,921 --> 00:45:45,121
My eyes hurt from eating this.

1119
00:45:45,461 --> 00:45:47,191
The smell's getting into my eyes.

1120
00:45:47,191 --> 00:45:50,991
(We only put healthy ingredients in it just for you.)

1121
00:45:52,061 --> 00:45:54,361
(It's Kwang Soo's turn to have his spoonful.)

1122
00:45:54,991 --> 00:45:56,491
(He's careful.)

1123
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:59,561
I'm already full after a spoonful.

1124
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,261
How is that a spoonful?

1125
00:46:03,591 --> 00:46:05,121
(He's trying hard to get everything in one spoonful.)

1126
00:46:05,121 --> 00:46:06,161
It's so bitter.

1127
00:46:06,161 --> 00:46:07,191
(He's trying hard to get everything in one spoonful.)

1128
00:46:07,491 --> 00:46:09,161
How did he do that?

1129
00:46:09,491 --> 00:46:10,861
Do you think you can fit all that in your mouth?

1130
00:46:10,861 --> 00:46:12,991
Why did you put that on top?

1131
00:46:13,161 --> 00:46:14,161
You don't need that.

1132
00:46:14,161 --> 00:46:16,121
(The nagging starts again.)

1133
00:46:16,121 --> 00:46:17,961
Get your hands off.

1134
00:46:17,961 --> 00:46:19,061
(Kwang Soo is mad.)

1135
00:46:19,061 --> 00:46:22,521
- I almost dropped it. - Fine, Kwang Soo.

1136
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:24,621
You shouldn't have done that to me in Hanok Village.

1137
00:46:25,161 --> 00:46:27,761
- Kwang Soo. - I'm sorry.

1138
00:46:27,761 --> 00:46:28,891
I'm really sorry,

1139
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:32,191
but can you go play somewhere else? We're eating here.

1140
00:46:32,821 --> 00:46:34,291
What?

1141
00:46:35,021 --> 00:46:36,061
There you go.

1142
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:37,291
(He tries a spoonful.)

1143
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:40,661
(The entire Korean course meal is in one spoonful.)

1144
00:46:40,661 --> 00:46:43,091
- It's going to work. - It's looking good.

1145
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:44,291
- It's working. - There you go.

1146
00:46:46,991 --> 00:46:47,991
There you go.

1147
00:46:48,361 --> 00:46:50,891
(He holds grudges.)

1148
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:54,161
Are you going to allow that?

1149
00:46:54,161 --> 00:46:55,621
- You can't do that. - What?

1150
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:57,591
- You'll be able to do it this time. - Right.

1151
00:46:57,591 --> 00:46:59,091
(You can't stop me from eating.)

1152
00:47:00,261 --> 00:47:02,391
(He's shoving it in there.)

1153
00:47:04,261 --> 00:47:07,761
It hurt my Adam's apple when I tried to swallow.

1154
00:47:09,521 --> 00:47:12,191
(Be aware of the attack on your Adam's apple.)

1155
00:47:13,361 --> 00:47:14,491
(It's a tteokgalbi battle in the Adam's apple.)

1156
00:47:14,491 --> 00:47:15,691
You're not supposed to use your hands.

1157
00:47:15,691 --> 00:47:16,691
(It's a battle between tteokgalbi on the battlefield of Adam's apple.)

1158
00:47:16,691 --> 00:47:18,821
It'll keep hurting your Adam's apple.

1159
00:47:19,391 --> 00:47:20,691
You might throw up.

1160
00:47:20,691 --> 00:47:23,161
It's a fish. Look he's a fish.

1161
00:47:23,161 --> 00:47:25,121
(Kwang Soo's fish acting is top of the class.)

1162
00:47:25,121 --> 00:47:26,161
This is delicious.

1163
00:47:28,761 --> 00:47:30,121
Seok Jin isn't eating...

1164
00:47:31,221 --> 00:47:34,221
because he thinks he'll get food after the game ends.

1165
00:47:34,221 --> 00:47:35,491
(Seok Jin thinks he's getting food after the game ends.)

1166
00:47:36,661 --> 00:47:38,261
He doesn't want to fill up on rice balls.

1167
00:47:38,691 --> 00:47:41,861
Can you tell him that he's not getting anything else?

1168
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:43,761
(The satisfying mealtime is over.)

1169
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:46,821
While you're eating, the next decision awaits.

1170
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:49,091
(What next decision?)

1171
00:47:49,091 --> 00:47:50,591
Do we have to pay for the food?

1172
00:47:51,461 --> 00:47:53,221
Do we have to pay for the food?

1173
00:47:54,491 --> 00:47:57,391
(Running Man's Bill, Free Food, The Entire Staff Members' Bill)

1174
00:47:57,761 --> 00:47:59,261
We have to pay for our food?

1175
00:47:59,621 --> 00:48:00,861
But I didn't even get to eat.

1176
00:48:00,861 --> 00:48:03,761
I'd be so mad if I had to pay for everything after eating rice balls.

1177
00:48:03,761 --> 00:48:05,691
- This isn't fair. - We should be apart for this one.

1178
00:48:05,691 --> 00:48:08,191
- We should be. - Okay.

1179
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:12,121
In total, the bill is 578 dollars.

1180
00:48:12,121 --> 00:48:14,161
(Staff members' bill is 392 dollars. Running Man's bill is 186 dollars.)

1181
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,691
Will you be together or apart?

1182
00:48:16,691 --> 00:48:17,791
(Will you split the bill?)

1183
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:19,291
(Or make one person pay for the whole thing?)

1184
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:21,061
How should we do this, Kwang Soo?

1185
00:48:21,061 --> 00:48:24,091
I don't want to pay 100 dollars...

1186
00:48:24,891 --> 00:48:27,091
for a spoonful. Why should I?

1187
00:48:27,091 --> 00:48:28,661
That's what I think, too.

1188
00:48:28,661 --> 00:48:30,791
- What about you, Seok Jin? - We should be apart.

1189
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:33,891
There's no other way. This is war.

1190
00:48:33,891 --> 00:48:35,961
- All right. Then, Seok Jin. - Yes?

1191
00:48:36,661 --> 00:48:38,591
- Pick a number first. - Me?

1192
00:48:38,591 --> 00:48:39,591
(Everyone is on their own.)

1193
00:48:39,591 --> 00:48:40,691
Six was the lucky number, right?

1194
00:48:41,161 --> 00:48:42,991
I think 3 was the unlucky number. I pick number 3.

1195
00:48:42,991 --> 00:48:44,791
- Okay. - It'll be a lucky number this time.

1196
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:47,521
Seok Jin picked number three.

1197
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:49,291
Let's go.

1198
00:48:49,291 --> 00:48:53,861
(Only two people will be able to avoid paying.)

1199
00:48:54,661 --> 00:48:56,191
Please give me a zero.

1200
00:48:56,191 --> 00:48:57,191
(He prays that he won't pay.)

1201
00:48:57,891 --> 00:49:02,391
(Some of them will have to pay for the staff members' food.)

1202
00:49:02,391 --> 00:49:05,961
(How much will Seok Jin have to pay?)

1203
00:49:05,961 --> 00:49:08,391
(He gets 100 dollars.)

1204
00:49:08,691 --> 00:49:09,891
(He has to pay 100 dollars for some rice balls.)

1205
00:49:09,891 --> 00:49:11,861
- That's not that bad. - That's the second best option.

1206
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:13,561
Who's going next?

1207
00:49:14,261 --> 00:49:15,791
- Ji Hyo? - Why am I so unlucky?

1208
00:49:15,791 --> 00:49:18,461
- I'll go with number four. - Okay.

1209
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:22,391
(Ji Hyo also ate rice balls.)

1210
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:26,891
(I was unlucky to get rice balls.)

1211
00:49:26,891 --> 00:49:28,861
(I won't be unlucky this time.)

1212
00:49:29,861 --> 00:49:31,961
(She gets to pay 200 dollars for the staff members.)

1213
00:49:33,161 --> 00:49:34,591
(It's a shocking result.)

1214
00:49:34,591 --> 00:49:36,161
- How much is that? - Ji Hyo.

1215
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:38,291
(Exhilarated)

1216
00:49:38,791 --> 00:49:41,221
- What's going on with you today? - Today's not your day.

1217
00:49:41,221 --> 00:49:42,961
Today is not my day.

1218
00:49:42,961 --> 00:49:43,991
I'll go next.

1219
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:46,491
- Okay, Jong Kook. - I'll go with number two.

1220
00:49:47,761 --> 00:49:50,591
(Jong Kook ate 20 dollars' worth of raw beef from a spoonful.)

1221
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,961
Nobody got a zero so far.

1222
00:49:52,521 --> 00:49:56,221
(How much will he have to pay?)

1223
00:49:56,391 --> 00:49:58,121
(He doesn't need to pay.)

1224
00:49:58,521 --> 00:50:00,021
Haha?

1225
00:50:00,021 --> 00:50:01,891
- I'll go with number one. - Okay.

1226
00:50:02,491 --> 00:50:04,521
(Haha ate a lot today.)

1227
00:50:04,521 --> 00:50:06,761
(How much will he have to pay?)

1228
00:50:06,761 --> 00:50:07,791
(He got 100 dollars.)

1229
00:50:07,791 --> 00:50:09,221
It's not that bad.

1230
00:50:10,861 --> 00:50:12,261
(It's not that bad compared to what he ate.)

1231
00:50:13,191 --> 00:50:15,421
We meet again, Kwang Soo.

1232
00:50:16,121 --> 00:50:18,021
Let the best man win.

1233
00:50:18,691 --> 00:50:20,361
One of us will die.

1234
00:50:20,791 --> 00:50:22,521
We'll see who gets the last dance.

1235
00:50:22,521 --> 00:50:24,961
One of us three always gets to be the lucky one.

1236
00:50:24,961 --> 00:50:27,291
- That's right. - The other two are unlucky.

1237
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:28,721
One of us will live.

1238
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:30,861
Only one will get to live.

1239
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,691
One of you won't have to pay and the other one will pay 200 dollars.

1240
00:50:32,691 --> 00:50:33,691
Please.

1241
00:50:33,691 --> 00:50:35,491
(One of them won't have to pay and the other one will pay 200 dollars.)

1242
00:50:36,721 --> 00:50:39,291
He got lucky because he switched from number 4 to 6.

1243
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:41,861
- I choose number 6. - You shouldn't go for number 6.

1244
00:50:41,861 --> 00:50:43,291
That was the lucky number before.

1245
00:50:44,061 --> 00:50:45,091
It won't be the lucky number again.

1246
00:50:47,061 --> 00:50:48,221
(The two meet again in front of a large bill.)

1247
00:50:48,221 --> 00:50:49,291
It's a difficult path to number six.

1248
00:50:49,291 --> 00:50:51,191
(The two meet again in front of a large bill.)

1249
00:50:51,191 --> 00:50:52,291
I can't see.

1250
00:50:52,691 --> 00:50:55,261
- I must've gotten the good one. - I'll reveal both at once.

1251
00:50:55,291 --> 00:50:57,261
This one is mine and this is Kwang Soo's.

1252
00:50:57,261 --> 00:50:58,261
One...

1253
00:50:58,261 --> 00:50:59,391
(Left is Kwang Soo, right is Jae Seok.)

1254
00:51:00,521 --> 00:51:01,521
Two...

1255
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:03,521
(It's a battle of pride between the two unlucky men.)

1256
00:51:03,521 --> 00:51:04,521
Three.

1257
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:06,891
(How will this battle end?)

1258
00:51:06,891 --> 00:51:07,891
One, two, three.

1259
00:51:10,391 --> 00:51:11,391
One, two, three.

1260
00:51:12,521 --> 00:51:15,491
(Kwang Soo gets 200 dollars.)

1261
00:51:16,661 --> 00:51:18,021
(Jae Seok gets the better of Kwang Soo.)

1262
00:51:18,021 --> 00:51:19,061
Oh, my.

1263
00:51:19,061 --> 00:51:20,361
(Jae Seok gets the better of Kwang Soo.)

1264
00:51:20,361 --> 00:51:21,961
(Let's split the bill, Kwang Soo.)

1265
00:51:22,591 --> 00:51:23,591
I told you not to pick number six.

1266
00:51:23,591 --> 00:51:24,891
(Jae Seok is today's lucky man.)

1267
00:51:24,891 --> 00:51:27,221
Everything's working out for me.

1268
00:51:28,091 --> 00:51:29,591
This is amazing.

1269
00:51:29,591 --> 00:51:31,661
Why are you and I so unlucky today?

1270
00:51:32,691 --> 00:51:33,891
We'll be paying for Running Man.

1271
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:37,991
We're splitting the bill.

1272
00:51:37,991 --> 00:51:39,491
We'll each pay 94 dollars each.

1273
00:51:39,491 --> 00:51:41,261
That's right.

1274
00:51:41,261 --> 00:51:43,021
I only had a spoonful.

1275
00:51:43,261 --> 00:51:44,291
Thank you.

1276
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:45,391
Thank you for the meal.

1277
00:51:46,491 --> 00:51:48,221
(Probability Race: Together or Apart)

1278
00:51:49,491 --> 00:51:52,761
(The fourth course is Nambu Market.)

1279
00:51:55,191 --> 00:51:56,291
(This place has a long history and tradition.)

1280
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:58,891
Is this the famous market?

1281
00:51:59,691 --> 00:52:01,961
- I think we've been here before. - Really?

1282
00:52:01,961 --> 00:52:04,791
(This market is full of all kinds of food and necessities.)

1283
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:06,891
There's choouhtang.

1284
00:52:07,261 --> 00:52:09,591
It says, "Mall of Youth".

1285
00:52:09,591 --> 00:52:12,661
(Different generations coexist in this hot spot of Jeonju.)

1286
00:52:14,521 --> 00:52:16,291
(Today's last mission will be held out at Nambu Market.)

1287
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:18,291
I've seen this place on "VJ's on the Scene".

1288
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:19,961
- Really? - Yes.

1289
00:52:21,491 --> 00:52:22,491
- Really? - Yes.

1290
00:52:22,491 --> 00:52:23,861
(There are chairs and an R sign.)

1291
00:52:23,861 --> 00:52:25,461
- What's this? - What's this?

1292
00:52:26,091 --> 00:52:28,161
- Why are there so many chairs? - What are these chairs?

1293
00:52:29,121 --> 00:52:31,761
There are 10 chairs.

1294
00:52:32,491 --> 00:52:35,421
This course of Probability Race has 50R at stake.

1295
00:52:35,421 --> 00:52:37,591
- 50R? - We're at Nambu Market.

1296
00:52:37,591 --> 00:52:38,591
50R?

1297
00:52:38,591 --> 00:52:42,421
Using the initial consonants of the word, "Nambu Market",

1298
00:52:42,591 --> 00:52:44,521
you have to bring back five things...

1299
00:52:44,521 --> 00:52:47,061
that have at least two of the initial consonants in the name.

1300
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:48,361
What's this?

1301
00:52:48,591 --> 00:52:49,591
What's this?

1302
00:52:50,121 --> 00:52:52,491
You have to wear these before you go.

1303
00:52:52,991 --> 00:52:55,121
The clothes will unravel the longer you travel.

1304
00:52:55,761 --> 00:52:56,991
So that's the distance we're allowed to travel?

1305
00:52:56,991 --> 00:52:58,591
(You're only allowed to travel as far as the clothes allow you to.)

1306
00:52:58,591 --> 00:53:00,691
- We won't be able to go far. - This is fun.

1307
00:53:01,161 --> 00:53:03,291
(Their fates will be decided by random.)

1308
00:53:03,691 --> 00:53:05,661
Before you go,

1309
00:53:06,191 --> 00:53:09,491
you'll need money to purchase the five things.

1310
00:53:09,491 --> 00:53:11,261
- Right. - You will have to earn money...

1311
00:53:11,561 --> 00:53:18,491
by auctioning the name tags with your autographs on them.

1312
00:53:18,491 --> 00:53:21,991
- Why are you doing this? - That's embarrassing.

1313
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:23,791
(Who would buy our name tags?)

1314
00:53:24,121 --> 00:53:27,191
The bidders will be the staff members.

1315
00:53:27,861 --> 00:53:30,421
- The staff members? - Why would they...

1316
00:53:30,421 --> 00:53:31,861
want to have our autographs?

1317
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:36,391
(Win over the staff members to earn money for the mission.)

1318
00:53:36,391 --> 00:53:38,761
- Can I get some hand cream? - I know.

1319
00:53:38,761 --> 00:53:40,521
(These people won't be persuaded easily.)

1320
00:53:41,661 --> 00:53:43,661
Thank you for coming out.

1321
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:47,121
- She's the heart of Running Man. - Nothing gets done without her.

1322
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,861
- She works 4 to 5 jobs. - She does.

1323
00:53:49,861 --> 00:53:52,791
- She's a director. - She's also an actress.

1324
00:53:52,791 --> 00:53:54,491
(Oh Yi Seul, Editorial Director)

1325
00:53:54,491 --> 00:53:56,761
She's a hard-working person.

1326
00:53:56,761 --> 00:53:59,261
She makes many small mistakes.

1327
00:53:59,591 --> 00:54:01,191
- She's famous for that. - But nothing serious.

1328
00:54:01,521 --> 00:54:04,291
It's hard to tell whether we should tell her off or not.

1329
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:05,791
- She makes petty mistakes. - Right.

1330
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:09,421
He's the zimizib director from the field day.

1331
00:54:09,421 --> 00:54:10,491
(Yoon Hong Min, Camera Director)

1332
00:54:10,491 --> 00:54:12,121
He lost to Kwang Soo while arm wrestling.

1333
00:54:12,121 --> 00:54:14,791
(He looks like the Terminator, but he's actually weak.)

1334
00:54:15,621 --> 00:54:16,621
Dong Geun...

1335
00:54:17,661 --> 00:54:19,591
(This staff member is...)

1336
00:54:19,591 --> 00:54:21,191
He had double eyelid surgery done recently.

1337
00:54:21,521 --> 00:54:23,861
- He did? - Don't bring it up.

1338
00:54:24,391 --> 00:54:26,491
- The surgery was successful. - It looks so natural.

1339
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:27,791
- They look so natural. - They do.

1340
00:54:28,621 --> 00:54:30,561
I almost didn't recognize it.

1341
00:54:30,891 --> 00:54:34,291
Why are you looking at me like that? Don't glare at me.

1342
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:35,891
- There's nothing to be ashamed of. - Are you not glaring at me?

1343
00:54:35,891 --> 00:54:36,891
(Is it just your eyes?)

1344
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:38,791
(Enough bashing for now.)

1345
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:40,121
- Let's go by the order. - Okay.

1346
00:54:40,121 --> 00:54:41,591
Let's start with Kwang Soo.

1347
00:54:41,591 --> 00:54:43,361
This is the order?

1348
00:54:43,691 --> 00:54:46,261
We're allowed to appeal to them, right?

1349
00:54:46,391 --> 00:54:50,861
- We'll give you 10 seconds. - We need to appeal.

1350
00:54:50,961 --> 00:54:52,591
- That's too short. - It can't be longer than that.

1351
00:54:52,591 --> 00:54:54,921
You can appeal to them if you want.

1352
00:54:55,221 --> 00:54:56,761
No matter how much you pay for my name tag...

1353
00:54:59,121 --> 00:55:00,761
(What are you going to offer us?)

1354
00:55:01,061 --> 00:55:02,121
I'll pay you back...

1355
00:55:03,391 --> 00:55:04,391
in double.

1356
00:55:04,391 --> 00:55:05,391
I'll pay you back in double.

1357
00:55:05,391 --> 00:55:06,521
(It's a good opportunity to make money.)

1358
00:55:06,521 --> 00:55:08,761
- What? - What are you doing?

1359
00:55:08,761 --> 00:55:10,061
- What are you doing? - You can't do that.

1360
00:55:10,061 --> 00:55:12,491
- This is my campaign. - You can't do that.

1361
00:55:12,491 --> 00:55:13,491
- What are you doing? - I'll pay you in double.

1362
00:55:13,791 --> 00:55:16,191
- He's clever. - As long as it's below 100 dollars.

1363
00:55:16,191 --> 00:55:17,691
I pledge to you.

1364
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:18,891
You can't do that.

1365
00:55:18,891 --> 00:55:21,661
The people after you will pay back in triple.

1366
00:55:21,661 --> 00:55:22,991
(The name tags are very common to the staff.)

1367
00:55:22,991 --> 00:55:25,521
This is Kwang Soo's name tag.

1368
00:55:25,521 --> 00:55:28,261
- "I love you." - This is the name tag.

1369
00:55:28,261 --> 00:55:32,221
This is Kwang Soo's name tag with his autograph on it.

1370
00:55:32,591 --> 00:55:33,891
Starting with one dollar.

1371
00:55:34,061 --> 00:55:35,061
Is there one dollar?

1372
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:36,491
- Nobody. - It's only a dollar.

1373
00:55:36,491 --> 00:55:38,161
- One dollar and 20 cents. - Okay.

1374
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:39,791
- One dollar and 60 cents. - Okay.

1375
00:55:41,221 --> 00:55:43,261
- Two dollars. - We have two dollars.

1376
00:55:43,261 --> 00:55:45,521
Hold on. Are you an expert auctioneer?

1377
00:55:46,591 --> 00:55:48,691
- Do you even want this name tag? - He's not.

1378
00:55:48,691 --> 00:55:50,021
(Are you trying to raise the asking price?)

1379
00:55:50,021 --> 00:55:51,461
You're trying to raise the asking price.

1380
00:55:52,221 --> 00:55:53,791
What are you trying to do here?

1381
00:55:53,791 --> 00:55:55,191
(Why would you bid if you don't even want it?)

1382
00:55:55,591 --> 00:55:57,261
- He seriously wants my name tag. - Are you sure?

1383
00:55:57,261 --> 00:55:58,491
He called two dollars.

1384
00:55:58,791 --> 00:56:00,561
- In 5... - Two dollars and 10 cents.

1385
00:56:00,561 --> 00:56:01,991
- Okay. - Two dollars and 10 cents.

1386
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:03,361
- We're on a roll. - Five...

1387
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:04,961
- I call 2 dollars and 40 cents. - She called 2 dollars and 40 cents.

1388
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:06,621
- In 5, 4... - 2 dollars and 50 cents.

1389
00:56:06,621 --> 00:56:07,991
Two dollars and 50 cents? Thank you.

1390
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,691
- In 5... - Three dollars.

1391
00:56:09,691 --> 00:56:11,661
Are you also participating?

1392
00:56:11,661 --> 00:56:13,891
- That was out of the blue. - Are you also bidding?

1393
00:56:13,891 --> 00:56:15,291
All the staff can bid.

1394
00:56:15,421 --> 00:56:16,821
Really?

1395
00:56:16,821 --> 00:56:19,161
Some of the staff members are there...

1396
00:56:20,561 --> 00:56:22,121
only to lure people.

1397
00:56:22,121 --> 00:56:24,061
- Don't you think? - You're right.

1398
00:56:24,091 --> 00:56:26,691
- Some are acting as auctioneers. - They're auctioneers.

1399
00:56:26,691 --> 00:56:28,721
There are people who set standards.

1400
00:56:28,721 --> 00:56:30,491
We have three dollars.

1401
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:32,791
- If there's no higher bid... - There's one.

1402
00:56:32,791 --> 00:56:34,861
- Three dollars and 30 cents. - Three dollars and 30 cents?

1403
00:56:34,961 --> 00:56:36,591
- We have 3 dollars and 30 cents. - In 5, 4...

1404
00:56:36,591 --> 00:56:38,221
- There should be one more. - three...

1405
00:56:38,221 --> 00:56:40,361
- 10 dollars. - 10 dollars!

1406
00:56:40,791 --> 00:56:42,691
- 10 dollars. - 10 dollars!

1407
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:44,061
(10 dollars?)

1408
00:56:44,061 --> 00:56:45,091
(Kwang Soo walks up to her.)

1409
00:56:45,091 --> 00:56:47,861
- How about 20 dollars? - You'll end up spending more.

1410
00:56:47,961 --> 00:56:49,061
Did you see what she did?

1411
00:56:49,261 --> 00:56:51,291
She made a hand gesture saying 20 dollars.

1412
00:56:51,361 --> 00:56:53,161
- Did you see what she did? - I can't believe it.

1413
00:56:53,221 --> 00:56:54,921
She asked him for 20 dollars.

1414
00:56:55,861 --> 00:56:57,621
She's being tricky.

1415
00:56:57,621 --> 00:56:59,561
- She wants my name tag that much. - 10 dollars.

1416
00:56:59,691 --> 00:57:01,891
In 5, 4, 3...

1417
00:57:01,891 --> 00:57:04,091
- 10 dollars and 10 cents. - All right.

1418
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:06,391
- In 5, 4... - He has to pay 20 dollars.

1419
00:57:06,391 --> 00:57:08,561
- 10 dollars and 20 cents. - That sounds great.

1420
00:57:08,761 --> 00:57:10,461
- In 5, 4... - It's 10 dollars and 20 cents.

1421
00:57:10,461 --> 00:57:12,191
- 10 dollars and 30 cents. - 10 dollars and 30 cents?

1422
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:13,891
It only increases by 10 cents.

1423
00:57:13,891 --> 00:57:15,061
This is what I think.

1424
00:57:15,061 --> 00:57:17,061
Kwang Soo's name tag price increases only by 10 cents.

1425
00:57:17,591 --> 00:57:19,661
Everyone, please spend more money.

1426
00:57:19,661 --> 00:57:21,391
- The price is reaching its limit. - Only 10 cents?

1427
00:57:21,391 --> 00:57:23,121
- It's at its limit. - Everyone.

1428
00:57:23,121 --> 00:57:24,461
- 10 cents can be worth a lot. - It's at its limit.

1429
00:57:24,461 --> 00:57:26,561
I think the price has reached the limit.

1430
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:29,991
- It's at 10 dollars and 30 cents. - Some may increase by 1 cent.

1431
00:57:30,261 --> 00:57:31,721
In five...

1432
00:57:32,161 --> 00:57:33,761
- 11 dollars. - 11 dollars?

1433
00:57:33,761 --> 00:57:35,391
- It increased by a lot. - In 5, 4...

1434
00:57:35,391 --> 00:57:37,621
- 13 dollars. - That sounds good.

1435
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:41,421
- She's good at bidding. - In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1436
00:57:41,661 --> 00:57:42,861
Wait a minute.

1437
00:57:42,861 --> 00:57:45,021
- He raised his hand. - It's sold at 13 dollars.

1438
00:57:45,021 --> 00:57:46,391
It's sold at 13 dollars.

1439
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:49,021
She buys it at 13 dollars.

1440
00:57:49,021 --> 00:57:52,421
- She earned 26 dollars in return. - She made a lot.

1441
00:57:52,621 --> 00:57:55,161
- Wait for me. - She gained 13 dollars in profit.

1442
00:57:55,161 --> 00:57:56,521
That was a good strategy.

1443
00:57:56,521 --> 00:57:59,391
Next auction is...

1444
00:57:59,521 --> 00:58:00,791
for Seok Jin's name tag.

1445
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:05,091
You may convince the audience for the next 10 seconds.

1446
00:58:05,461 --> 00:58:06,861
- Please go on. - I have...

1447
00:58:06,861 --> 00:58:09,161
six beautiful sisters-in-law.

1448
00:58:09,961 --> 00:58:12,291
I'll set you up on a blind date with them.

1449
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:14,091
(Is a blind date on the line?)

1450
00:58:14,091 --> 00:58:16,991
I'll pay all the expenses for your first blind date.

1451
00:58:16,991 --> 00:58:18,221
(He offers to pay the expenses.)

1452
00:58:18,221 --> 00:58:19,991
(That's a good strategy.)

1453
00:58:19,991 --> 00:58:22,691
You should go to a jewelry shop on the first date.

1454
00:58:23,491 --> 00:58:25,661
- Wait a minute. - They need couple rings.

1455
00:58:25,661 --> 00:58:27,521
You need to get couple rings first.

1456
00:58:27,521 --> 00:58:29,061
I'll pay for the meal and the movie.

1457
00:58:29,761 --> 00:58:30,991
Get your couple rings first.

1458
00:58:30,991 --> 00:58:33,691
You'll get a blind date with the beautiful, youngest sister-in-law.

1459
00:58:33,691 --> 00:58:35,661
Do you have her permission?

1460
00:58:35,661 --> 00:58:38,091
Not yet, but I'll take care of that.

1461
00:58:38,261 --> 00:58:40,291
What about...

1462
00:58:40,291 --> 00:58:42,391
the female staff members?

1463
00:58:42,391 --> 00:58:43,821
- What would they get? - Do you have any men?

1464
00:58:43,821 --> 00:58:45,461
I also have a brother-in-law.

1465
00:58:46,021 --> 00:58:47,091
I have a brother-in-law.

1466
00:58:47,091 --> 00:58:48,661
How old is he?

1467
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:50,591
He's 48 years old.

1468
00:58:50,591 --> 00:58:53,461
(He's not too old.)

1469
00:58:53,461 --> 00:58:56,491
My brother-in-law...

1470
00:58:56,521 --> 00:58:59,491
isn't married yet.

1471
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:01,061
- He's 48? - He's still single.

1472
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:02,891
- I also have young brothers-in-law. - Let's get started.

1473
00:59:02,891 --> 00:59:04,991
I have young brothers-in-law who are great.

1474
00:59:04,991 --> 00:59:06,861
- It's for Seok Jin's autograph. - I really do.

1475
00:59:06,861 --> 00:59:10,191
As you saw, he signed it with a pen. Let's start with one dollar.

1476
00:59:10,191 --> 00:59:11,521
- One dollar. - Please.

1477
00:59:12,391 --> 00:59:14,861
- In five... - Don't avoid my eyes.

1478
00:59:14,861 --> 00:59:16,721
- In 3, 2... - Don't do this.

1479
00:59:16,721 --> 00:59:17,991
My sister-in-law is beautiful.

1480
00:59:17,991 --> 00:59:20,921
- We have 1 dollar and 20 cents. - Thank you.

1481
00:59:20,991 --> 00:59:22,261
- She studied chemistry. - 1 dollar and 50 cents.

1482
00:59:22,261 --> 00:59:23,591
We have 1 dollar and 50 cents.

1483
00:59:23,991 --> 00:59:25,761
In 5, 4,

1484
00:59:25,761 --> 00:59:27,291
- She's really beautiful. - three,

1485
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:28,791
- She's like... - One dollar and 60 cents.

1486
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:30,361
- We have 1 dollar and 60 cents. - You'd better show us...

1487
00:59:30,361 --> 00:59:32,891
- a proof of blind date. - In 5, 4...

1488
00:59:32,891 --> 00:59:34,521
- 3, 2... - No one is making a bid.

1489
00:59:34,521 --> 00:59:35,791
- We should confirm it. - Two dollars.

1490
00:59:35,791 --> 00:59:38,191
- We have two dollars. - Thank you.

1491
00:59:38,191 --> 00:59:40,861
I'm telling you. Se Mi is an auctioneer.

1492
00:59:41,221 --> 00:59:43,391
Didn't you hear that he's 48?

1493
00:59:43,921 --> 00:59:45,461
One of them is in his early 30s.

1494
00:59:45,891 --> 00:59:47,421
- Five dollars. - Five dollars!

1495
00:59:47,821 --> 00:59:51,861
In 5, 4, 3, 2...

1496
00:59:51,861 --> 00:59:53,691
- Come on, I need more. - One.

1497
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:55,961
Come on, I need more.

1498
00:59:56,361 --> 00:59:58,221
She was startled.

1499
00:59:58,891 --> 01:00:01,521
Did you hear what she said? "My goodness, five dollars?"

1500
01:00:01,761 --> 01:00:04,261
She's spending her precious five dollars...

1501
01:00:04,261 --> 01:00:05,961
- on him. - What did you say?

1502
01:00:06,691 --> 01:00:09,561
- Goodness. - Take a photo of her blind date.

1503
01:00:09,561 --> 01:00:11,791
- All right. - He's 48 years old.

1504
01:00:13,161 --> 01:00:16,261
Yes, I have a brother-in-law who's younger.

1505
01:00:16,621 --> 01:00:18,291
- He looks like Kim Je Dong. - Here you go.

1506
01:00:19,961 --> 01:00:22,121
- He looks like Je Dong. - Congratulations.

1507
01:00:22,391 --> 01:00:25,291
Next up is Ji Hyo.

1508
01:00:25,491 --> 01:00:27,221
- Come this way. - Ji Hyo's autograph is nice.

1509
01:00:27,491 --> 01:00:29,121
- It's great. - Hers might be sold...

1510
01:00:29,121 --> 01:00:32,391
- She's the only female member. - at the highest price.

1511
01:00:32,391 --> 01:00:33,721
She has many fellow actress friends.

1512
01:00:34,191 --> 01:00:36,661
- Come up with a strategy. - Okay.

1513
01:00:38,761 --> 01:00:40,621
(They're dying to know what she's offering.)

1514
01:00:40,891 --> 01:00:42,861
This is my autograph.

1515
01:00:43,461 --> 01:00:45,291
My strategy is...

1516
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:46,891
(What will be her strategy?)

1517
01:00:46,891 --> 01:00:48,091
Together...

1518
01:00:49,591 --> 01:00:50,921
- Together? - Together with you?

1519
01:00:51,791 --> 01:00:52,921
Together...

1520
01:00:53,521 --> 01:00:54,691
- Together? - Together with you?

1521
01:00:54,691 --> 01:00:56,191
We'll take a selfie.

1522
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:59,021
- Come on, that isn't good enough. - She's being arrogant.

1523
01:00:59,021 --> 01:01:00,991
- Also... - Show her that you disapprove.

1524
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:04,491
- Come on. - Wait.

1525
01:01:04,491 --> 01:01:06,861
She's being too arrogant, don't you think?

1526
01:01:07,021 --> 01:01:08,861
- Let's show that we disapprove. - I am...

1527
01:01:08,861 --> 01:01:11,821
bad at taking selfies, but I'll try my best.

1528
01:01:11,821 --> 01:01:14,161
- I'm saying that I'll try my best. - Actually,

1529
01:01:14,161 --> 01:01:15,861
Ji Hyo doesn't like taking selfies.

1530
01:01:15,861 --> 01:01:17,561
- It's too embarrassing for me. - Here's your chance.

1531
01:01:17,561 --> 01:01:19,661
You never know how it will turn out.

1532
01:01:19,791 --> 01:01:22,061
It'd be embarrassing if hers is sold at a higher price.

1533
01:01:22,061 --> 01:01:24,791
Due to Kim Young Ran Act,

1534
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:27,491
I'll give you 29 dollar 90 cent gift certificate.

1535
01:01:27,491 --> 01:01:30,421
- What kind of gift? - Whatever it is, I'll pay.

1536
01:01:30,421 --> 01:01:33,091
- That's the deal. - Why not just give them cash?

1537
01:01:33,491 --> 01:01:35,691
- Just give them cash. - It's to show my sincerity.

1538
01:01:35,691 --> 01:01:36,861
- Will you give them money? - Yes.

1539
01:01:36,861 --> 01:01:38,691
- You'll pay for whatever it is? - Yes.

1540
01:01:38,691 --> 01:01:40,361
- Will you come if they call you? - Yes.

1541
01:01:40,621 --> 01:01:41,691
- Really? - Yes.

1542
01:01:41,691 --> 01:01:42,991
This is not bad.

1543
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:44,261
- She'll come in person. - Really?

1544
01:01:44,261 --> 01:01:45,691
- This is great. - It's a great prize.

1545
01:01:45,691 --> 01:01:48,121
Let's start the auction for Ji Hyo's autograph.

1546
01:01:48,521 --> 01:01:49,961
- We start with one dollar. - One dollar.

1547
01:01:49,961 --> 01:01:51,061
Five dollars.

1548
01:01:52,121 --> 01:01:53,661
- That's high. - First of all,

1549
01:01:53,861 --> 01:01:55,391
- She might come to Apgujeong. - the first bid is...

1550
01:01:55,391 --> 01:01:57,791
- as high as Seok Jin's final price. - I will.

1551
01:01:58,191 --> 01:02:00,561
It's the same as...

1552
01:02:00,621 --> 01:02:03,891
Seok Jin's final price.

1553
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:05,291
- We have 5 dollars. - 10 dollars.

1554
01:02:05,291 --> 01:02:06,791
10 dollars?

1555
01:02:06,891 --> 01:02:08,661
The final price for...

1556
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:10,721
Kwang Soo was 13 dollars. We have 10 dollars.

1557
01:02:10,721 --> 01:02:11,791
- In 5... - 15 dollars.

1558
01:02:11,791 --> 01:02:13,921
- We have 15 dollars. - Goodness.

1559
01:02:14,961 --> 01:02:17,221
He increased his bid by 10 cents for me.

1560
01:02:17,621 --> 01:02:18,661
Did he?

1561
01:02:19,221 --> 01:02:21,221
Did you have more money?

1562
01:02:21,661 --> 01:02:23,261
- Come back here. - I thought he didn't have money...

1563
01:02:23,261 --> 01:02:24,761
because he increased by 10 cents.

1564
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,021
He's impressive.

1565
01:02:26,361 --> 01:02:27,921
How could he?

1566
01:02:28,491 --> 01:02:31,621
No matter the situation, he increases the price by 10 cents.

1567
01:02:31,621 --> 01:02:34,021
His lips were trembling when he called 10 more cents.

1568
01:02:34,021 --> 01:02:35,791
We have 15 dollars.

1569
01:02:36,121 --> 01:02:37,121
20 dollars.

1570
01:02:37,121 --> 01:02:39,291
- Really? - That's a big increase.

1571
01:02:40,061 --> 01:02:41,461
In 5, 4...

1572
01:02:41,461 --> 01:02:43,291
- 23 dollars. - My goodness.

1573
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:45,361
- 23 dollars. - My goodness.

1574
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:47,361
Take turn one by one!

1575
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:49,661
- You punks. - He called...

1576
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:51,661
for 23 dollars.

1577
01:02:51,891 --> 01:02:53,521
We have 23 dollars.

1578
01:02:53,761 --> 01:02:55,421
- In 5, 4... - 30 dollars.

1579
01:02:55,421 --> 01:02:57,821
- 30 dollars. - Were you that generous?

1580
01:02:59,121 --> 01:03:00,491
Goodness.

1581
01:03:01,521 --> 01:03:02,521
- Four... - How high will it go?

1582
01:03:02,521 --> 01:03:03,891
- 35 dollars. - 35 dollars?

1583
01:03:03,891 --> 01:03:05,761
- People are getting competitive. - I think...

1584
01:03:05,761 --> 01:03:08,821
During our auction, they felt obligated to do it,

1585
01:03:09,521 --> 01:03:11,221
but now they're being honest.

1586
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:13,161
- This is a real auction now. - Five.

1587
01:03:13,261 --> 01:03:14,891
- Four. - 40 dollars.

1588
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:16,761
- 40 dollars? - Really?

1589
01:03:16,761 --> 01:03:19,591
- He has a lot of money. - He became handsome after surgery.

1590
01:03:19,861 --> 01:03:21,021
He's as handsome as a sculpture.

1591
01:03:21,791 --> 01:03:23,121
That's right.

1592
01:03:24,291 --> 01:03:26,091
Okay, in five,

1593
01:03:26,091 --> 01:03:27,691
- four... - 50 dollars.

1594
01:03:27,691 --> 01:03:28,921
50 dollars?

1595
01:03:28,921 --> 01:03:29,961
- 46 dollars and 50 cents. - 50 dollars.

1596
01:03:29,961 --> 01:03:31,021
50 dollars?

1597
01:03:31,021 --> 01:03:33,191
- Come on. - It's 50 dollars.

1598
01:03:33,191 --> 01:03:36,091
- What's wrong with you? - It's 10 times more than mine.

1599
01:03:36,091 --> 01:03:37,221
He called 50 dollars.

1600
01:03:37,691 --> 01:03:38,791
Oh, my goodness.

1601
01:03:39,561 --> 01:03:41,121
It's not over yet, either.

1602
01:03:41,491 --> 01:03:43,221
It's so frustrating.

1603
01:03:43,461 --> 01:03:45,091
It's sold at 50 dollars.

1604
01:03:45,091 --> 01:03:47,021
(Ji Hyo's autograph is sold at 50 dollars.)

1605
01:03:47,521 --> 01:03:49,221
Thank you, Director.

1606
01:03:49,221 --> 01:03:51,591
- I'm doomed. - Women are dangerous beings.

1607
01:03:52,521 --> 01:03:54,191
After something is sold at a high price,

1608
01:03:54,461 --> 01:03:57,161
- It's unlucky to start after. - the next one isn't very high.

1609
01:03:57,591 --> 01:03:59,121
Is it my turn?

1610
01:03:59,391 --> 01:04:00,521
Next up is Haha.

1611
01:04:00,891 --> 01:04:01,961
He's in trouble.

1612
01:04:01,961 --> 01:04:03,461
(The auction for Haha's autograph starts.)

1613
01:04:03,461 --> 01:04:05,421
I'm getting competitive.

1614
01:04:05,561 --> 01:04:08,021
You can tell by the look in their eyes if they're working...

1615
01:04:08,021 --> 01:04:09,921
or if they're being honest.

1616
01:04:09,921 --> 01:04:11,121
Seriously.

1617
01:04:11,721 --> 01:04:12,861
Okay.

1618
01:04:12,861 --> 01:04:15,191
(Will he make a successful bid?)

1619
01:04:15,191 --> 01:04:17,121
- Okay. - What's your strategy?

1620
01:04:17,121 --> 01:04:19,591
Here's to the one who buys my autograph.

1621
01:04:19,661 --> 01:04:22,791
As it's the end of the year, there are many events.

1622
01:04:22,791 --> 01:04:24,761
- That's true. - If you bring this...

1623
01:04:26,921 --> 01:04:33,061
and come to my restaurant in Hongdae,

1624
01:04:33,061 --> 01:04:35,621
the whole party...

1625
01:04:36,291 --> 01:04:37,521
Never mind.

1626
01:04:38,091 --> 01:04:40,261
- No one said anything. - He hasn't decided yet.

1627
01:04:40,261 --> 01:04:42,391
No one said anything.

1628
01:04:42,561 --> 01:04:44,561
- What's going on? - He's estimating the cost.

1629
01:04:44,891 --> 01:04:46,721
- Be careful what you say. - For how many people?

1630
01:04:46,721 --> 01:04:48,291
- Make it clear. - For 10 people.

1631
01:04:48,591 --> 01:04:49,991
10 people? That's a lot.

1632
01:04:49,991 --> 01:04:51,921
I'll give you 10-person family discount...

1633
01:04:52,161 --> 01:04:53,221
Is it only a discount?

1634
01:04:53,221 --> 01:04:54,221
Come on.

1635
01:04:54,221 --> 01:04:55,291
(Is it only a discount?)

1636
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:57,691
- Is it only a discount? - Come on.

1637
01:04:57,721 --> 01:04:59,221
Discount isn't good enough.

1638
01:04:59,221 --> 01:05:02,061
- It won't be a discount. - You should make it free.

1639
01:05:03,091 --> 01:05:05,091
- Gosh. - 10 people is a lot.

1640
01:05:05,091 --> 01:05:06,761
- Isn't it? - Make it four people.

1641
01:05:06,761 --> 01:05:09,291
- Make it four people. - Offer something you can.

1642
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:11,491
- I'll give one table for free. - How about five people?

1643
01:05:12,061 --> 01:05:14,061
10 people can sit at one table.

1644
01:05:14,261 --> 01:05:16,221
People can squeeze in like this.

1645
01:05:16,221 --> 01:05:18,221
That's true.

1646
01:05:18,221 --> 01:05:19,491
(It's a new way to eat.)

1647
01:05:19,821 --> 01:05:21,691
- You can eat like this. - It's possible for four people.

1648
01:05:21,691 --> 01:05:24,161
- It's enough for 10. - It's possible.

1649
01:05:24,161 --> 01:05:25,991
Six people can sit like that.

1650
01:05:25,991 --> 01:05:27,461
Make your offer.

1651
01:05:27,461 --> 01:05:28,861
- Be generous. - What's your offer?

1652
01:05:28,861 --> 01:05:30,621
I'll give you 200-dollar coupon.

1653
01:05:30,861 --> 01:05:31,991
200 dollars?

1654
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:33,661
Isn't that too much?

1655
01:05:33,661 --> 01:05:35,421
- That's not allowed. - You can take 200 dollars...

1656
01:05:35,421 --> 01:05:37,261
for a low price.

1657
01:05:37,591 --> 01:05:39,891
This isn't allowed.

1658
01:05:39,891 --> 01:05:42,021
Let's see what happens.

1659
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,421
Get ready. We start at one dollar.

1660
01:05:44,421 --> 01:05:47,161
- It may be possible. - For 200-dollar gift certificate.

1661
01:05:47,491 --> 01:05:49,291
- That's too much. - We start at one dollar.

1662
01:05:49,291 --> 01:05:51,061
- 200 dollars? - 5 dollars.

1663
01:05:51,061 --> 01:05:52,361
- 5 dollars? - 10 dollars.

1664
01:05:52,361 --> 01:05:54,161
- We have 10 dollars. - He's quite generous.

1665
01:05:54,161 --> 01:05:55,491
- 15 dollars. - 15 dollars.

1666
01:05:55,521 --> 01:05:57,191
I offered a 200-dollar gift, after all.

1667
01:05:57,191 --> 01:05:59,021
- 20 dollars. - 20 dollars?

1668
01:05:59,061 --> 01:06:00,591
They don't care about the autograph.

1669
01:06:02,161 --> 01:06:03,761
They don't even care.

1670
01:06:04,591 --> 01:06:06,291
- Hey. - All right.

1671
01:06:06,721 --> 01:06:08,291
Haha wanted me to tell you this.

1672
01:06:08,291 --> 01:06:09,461
You can't take it home.

1673
01:06:11,021 --> 01:06:12,721
- You have to come... - That's obvious.

1674
01:06:12,721 --> 01:06:14,991
- and eat at the restaurant. - Right.

1675
01:06:14,991 --> 01:06:17,291
- It's for 200 dollars. - You can't take it home.

1676
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:18,291
Sure.

1677
01:06:18,761 --> 01:06:20,161
- Cameraman? - 30 dollars.

1678
01:06:20,821 --> 01:06:22,221
Great.

1679
01:06:22,991 --> 01:06:24,291
33 dollars.

1680
01:06:25,361 --> 01:06:27,361
- 35 dollars. - 35?

1681
01:06:27,361 --> 01:06:29,461
The cameraman wants to use it with his family.

1682
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:30,961
- He made up his mind. - He's serious.

1683
01:06:30,961 --> 01:06:32,291
- He's serious. - He made up his mind.

1684
01:06:32,291 --> 01:06:35,161
He plans to use as much as 100 dollars.

1685
01:06:35,161 --> 01:06:37,121
- He's serious. - Five, four...

1686
01:06:38,091 --> 01:06:39,821
(Is the cameraman the winner?)

1687
01:06:39,821 --> 01:06:41,361
- 100 dollars. - 100 dollars?

1688
01:06:42,691 --> 01:06:44,061
(She has everybody on their toes.)

1689
01:06:44,061 --> 01:06:45,091
Already?

1690
01:06:45,421 --> 01:06:47,121
Mi Yeon says 100 dollars.

1691
01:06:47,591 --> 01:06:49,761
You never did that for me, Mi Yeon.

1692
01:06:50,091 --> 01:06:52,121
- I didn't even know she was there. - Same.

1693
01:06:52,121 --> 01:06:53,361
- Me neither. - 100 dollars.

1694
01:06:53,621 --> 01:06:55,561
- Five, four, - That's great.

1695
01:06:55,721 --> 01:06:58,221
- three, two, one. - People won't go higher than that.

1696
01:06:58,221 --> 01:06:59,721
(That was the highest betting amount yet.)

1697
01:07:00,661 --> 01:07:02,261
That's pretty high.

1698
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:04,661
Mi Yeon didn't want the autograph.

1699
01:07:04,661 --> 01:07:10,021
She wanted the coupon at a 50 percent discount.

1700
01:07:10,021 --> 01:07:11,261
(Is this what you're going to do?)

1701
01:07:11,921 --> 01:07:13,891
(Thank you, anyway.)

1702
01:07:14,891 --> 01:07:16,921
(Here's proof she ate at the restaurant.)

1703
01:07:16,921 --> 01:07:19,861
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1704
01:07:20,561 --> 01:07:22,521
Haha went too far.

1705
01:07:22,521 --> 01:07:24,561
You should do personal training for them.

1706
01:07:24,561 --> 01:07:26,091
- Personal training sounds good. - Consider it.

1707
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:29,521
- They are starting to participate. - That's right.

1708
01:07:29,521 --> 01:07:31,291
They don't want the autograph.

1709
01:07:31,521 --> 01:07:33,791
You have to provide something on the side.

1710
01:07:33,791 --> 01:07:35,521
I should have done that.

1711
01:07:35,521 --> 01:07:36,721
That's not even it.

1712
01:07:36,721 --> 01:07:38,721
- The autograph doesn't matter. - It doesn't.

1713
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,861
- It's not because they like me. - It's not.

1714
01:07:40,861 --> 01:07:47,721
I'm going to hold a concert for Turbo on Valentine's Day.

1715
01:07:48,691 --> 01:07:50,591
- Concert tickets? - If you bring this with you,

1716
01:07:50,591 --> 01:07:53,921
I'll give you two concert tickets.

1717
01:07:54,161 --> 01:07:55,591
- For two? - On top of that,

1718
01:07:55,591 --> 01:07:57,621
and... And.

1719
01:07:57,621 --> 01:08:01,421
During our last concert, we had Park Bo Gum and Song Joong Ki.

1720
01:08:01,421 --> 01:08:03,721
- What about me? - And me?

1721
01:08:03,721 --> 01:08:04,921
Yi Seul...

1722
01:08:04,921 --> 01:08:07,561
Yi Seul reacted for the first time.

1723
01:08:07,561 --> 01:08:10,121
- We're going to have guests. - Really?

1724
01:08:10,121 --> 01:08:12,761
You get a picture with the guest celebrity.

1725
01:08:12,761 --> 01:08:14,591
(A picture with the guest celebrity?)

1726
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:16,161
- Really? - You'll get the opportunity.

1727
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:19,461
- It'll be me. - No.

1728
01:08:20,121 --> 01:08:21,361
(That destroyed her heart.)

1729
01:08:21,361 --> 01:08:23,221
No, it's not him.

1730
01:08:23,461 --> 01:08:24,991
- It's me. - And...

1731
01:08:24,991 --> 01:08:26,221
there's more.

1732
01:08:26,221 --> 01:08:28,721
If you'd like to come as a couple...

1733
01:08:28,721 --> 01:08:31,521
and want to do something special on the stage,

1734
01:08:31,761 --> 01:08:34,661
we'll help you with it.

1735
01:08:34,661 --> 01:08:37,291
We'll plan it ahead of time in secret.

1736
01:08:37,431 --> 01:08:40,361
That's all included...

1737
01:08:40,761 --> 01:08:41,861
- in the package. - That's pretty good.

1738
01:08:41,861 --> 01:08:44,591
It'll be a special segment during the concert.

1739
01:08:44,661 --> 01:08:46,591
- Memories last. - All right.

1740
01:08:47,061 --> 01:08:49,791
Jong Kook's name tag...

1741
01:08:50,221 --> 01:08:51,691
We'll start betting on his name tag.

1742
01:08:52,221 --> 01:08:53,291
One dollar.

1743
01:08:54,021 --> 01:08:55,961
- 20 dollars. - 20 dollars?

1744
01:08:55,961 --> 01:08:57,591
- He has a girlfriend. - Really?

1745
01:08:57,721 --> 01:08:59,891
He wants to do something special.

1746
01:09:00,021 --> 01:09:01,861
- It'll be great for a proposal. - Four, three,

1747
01:09:02,361 --> 01:09:04,621
- two, one. - It's almost done.

1748
01:09:04,861 --> 01:09:05,861
(Hammering)

1749
01:09:07,361 --> 01:09:10,861
(Jong Kook's name tag is sold at 20 dollars.)

1750
01:09:10,861 --> 01:09:12,061
It's done.

1751
01:09:12,061 --> 01:09:14,991
- It's done. - That was too fast.

1752
01:09:14,991 --> 01:09:16,561
There are no couples here.

1753
01:09:17,961 --> 01:09:19,291
That was only 20 dollars.

1754
01:09:19,291 --> 01:09:21,221
- That was only 20 dollars. - My goodness.

1755
01:09:21,221 --> 01:09:23,191
We'll make it great.

1756
01:09:23,191 --> 01:09:25,721
He has a girlfriend.

1757
01:09:26,391 --> 01:09:28,291
Nobody here has girlfriends.

1758
01:09:28,291 --> 01:09:31,191
- We'll do something special. - Nobody here has girlfriends.

1759
01:09:32,291 --> 01:09:34,521
(Watch what I do.)

1760
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:36,491
- I'll show you. - You were talking about couples.

1761
01:09:36,861 --> 01:09:38,721
Look at what Jae Seok is doing.

1762
01:09:39,161 --> 01:09:41,291
What if he invites them over to his house and nags at them?

1763
01:09:42,061 --> 01:09:43,461
What if he disciplines them?

1764
01:09:44,291 --> 01:09:45,691
Everybody.

1765
01:09:45,991 --> 01:09:48,931
- You've worked hard this year. - Come on.

1766
01:09:48,931 --> 01:09:50,161
Let's shake hands.

1767
01:09:50,161 --> 01:09:51,861
Jae Seok, you can't do that.

1768
01:09:51,861 --> 01:09:54,161
- You can't do that. - Stop it.

1769
01:09:54,161 --> 01:09:55,291
You can't shake hands with them.

1770
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:56,961
- Why not? - You can't.

1771
01:09:56,961 --> 01:09:58,591
- Fine. - Get back.

1772
01:09:58,591 --> 01:10:01,061
- Let's get started in 10 seconds. - It must be...

1773
01:10:01,061 --> 01:10:03,431
a coincidence.

1774
01:10:03,431 --> 01:10:05,261
It's the strangest coincidence...

1775
01:10:05,261 --> 01:10:08,091
but I have a gift card on me.

1776
01:10:08,461 --> 01:10:09,521
You have it on you?

1777
01:10:09,991 --> 01:10:11,091
I'll planning to get it.

1778
01:10:12,221 --> 01:10:14,521
I was planning to get one.

1779
01:10:14,521 --> 01:10:16,291
- I was planning to get one. - What do you mean?

1780
01:10:16,291 --> 01:10:18,931
You were planning to get a gift card?

1781
01:10:19,261 --> 01:10:21,521
I mean, I was planning to get one and this happened.

1782
01:10:21,521 --> 01:10:24,591
- It's killing 2 birds with 1 stone. - How much is it worth?

1783
01:10:24,591 --> 01:10:26,861
- How much is it for? - I'll get one...

1784
01:10:26,961 --> 01:10:28,291
for 300 dollars.

1785
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:30,591
- Really? - What are you doing?

1786
01:10:30,961 --> 01:10:32,931
- You must be insane. - You can't go this far.

1787
01:10:32,931 --> 01:10:34,361
That's not fair.

1788
01:10:34,361 --> 01:10:35,431
What are you doing?

1789
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:36,931
- I have a gift card... - Let me go again.

1790
01:10:36,931 --> 01:10:39,931
- at home for 2,000 dollars. - I want to go again.

1791
01:10:40,221 --> 01:10:41,661
- Where's my name tag? - Fine.

1792
01:10:41,661 --> 01:10:43,691
- Bring it back. - I...

1793
01:10:43,691 --> 01:10:46,461
I have a bond at home.

1794
01:10:46,961 --> 01:10:49,461
I thought you might get the wrong idea.

1795
01:10:49,461 --> 01:10:52,791
That's why I was hesitant on saying it.

1796
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:54,391
- Fine, then. - You can't get money involved.

1797
01:10:54,391 --> 01:10:56,821
- It has to be related to you. - Let's not get money involved.

1798
01:10:56,821 --> 01:10:59,461
- It has to be something memorable. - I was just joking...

1799
01:10:59,461 --> 01:11:00,961
but I'll do something memorable for you.

1800
01:11:00,961 --> 01:11:03,931
I recommend slapping your forehead.

1801
01:11:04,391 --> 01:11:07,491
- Slapping his forehead? - Slapping his forehead?

1802
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:09,431
- Seriously? - He wants to slap his forehead.

1803
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:10,891
- That's a great idea. - I'm in.

1804
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:12,521
- Hold on. - I want to participate.

1805
01:11:12,521 --> 01:11:14,261
- Be quick. - Get out.

1806
01:11:14,261 --> 01:11:15,521
Hey.

1807
01:11:15,621 --> 01:11:16,931
- How could you? - What's the matter?

1808
01:11:16,931 --> 01:11:19,821
- 300 dollars. - What's wrong with you?

1809
01:11:19,821 --> 01:11:21,161
2,500 dollars.

1810
01:11:21,761 --> 01:11:23,021
57,000 dollars.

1811
01:11:23,591 --> 01:11:25,561
- That's a great idea. - Okay, then.

1812
01:11:25,821 --> 01:11:29,431
Everybody, along with my name tag,

1813
01:11:30,061 --> 01:11:32,161
you get to slap my forehead.

1814
01:11:32,431 --> 01:11:35,591
- Once is not fun... - Just once.

1815
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:37,591
so you can slap his forehead whenever you want.

1816
01:11:38,361 --> 01:11:41,161
- You can do what you feel like. - You can't do that.

1817
01:11:41,161 --> 01:11:43,291
- What about five times? - You can't do that.

1818
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:45,291
You can slap his forehead with this.

1819
01:11:46,161 --> 01:11:47,621
- This is part of the auction. - Hey.

1820
01:11:47,621 --> 01:11:50,021
- I'm not a lobster. - I'm sorry.

1821
01:11:50,161 --> 01:11:51,591
- It's part of the auction. - Hey.

1822
01:11:51,861 --> 01:11:53,721
- They're related. - I'll break my skull.

1823
01:11:53,721 --> 01:11:55,621
They're related.

1824
01:11:55,991 --> 01:12:00,021
You get a chance to hit a star's forehead.

1825
01:12:00,021 --> 01:12:02,021
(You get to hit a star's forehead.)

1826
01:12:02,021 --> 01:12:04,891
If you are stressed, take it out on me.

1827
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:07,891
You can take your stress out on me.

1828
01:12:07,891 --> 01:12:10,661
I think their stress comes from you.

1829
01:12:10,661 --> 01:12:13,291
I think he'll bet the highest amount.

1830
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:16,361
It's between Chul Min and Hwan Jin.

1831
01:12:16,361 --> 01:12:17,821
(It'll be a close match between those two.)

1832
01:12:17,821 --> 01:12:20,361
- What about Yong Woo? - It's between the producers.

1833
01:12:20,961 --> 01:12:22,091
Let's get started.

1834
01:12:22,821 --> 01:12:23,991
100 dollars and 10 cents.

1835
01:12:26,221 --> 01:12:28,661
You must be crazy. He's definitely insane.

1836
01:12:29,121 --> 01:12:30,661
- Hey. - 120 dollars.

1837
01:12:31,161 --> 01:12:34,931
- 120 dollars? - You're insane.

1838
01:12:34,931 --> 01:12:36,221
- 120 dollars? - 120 dollars and 10 cents.

1839
01:12:36,221 --> 01:12:38,061
- 120 dollars and 10 cents. - It's between them two.

1840
01:12:38,061 --> 01:12:39,821
Five, four...

1841
01:12:39,821 --> 01:12:41,961
(They're not stepping down from the competition.)

1842
01:12:43,091 --> 01:12:47,291
(Why are these two producers so eager?)

1843
01:12:47,291 --> 01:12:53,221
(They had to deal with Jae Seok all this time.)

1844
01:12:53,221 --> 01:12:57,561
(Jae Seok is like the nagging mother-in-law.)

1845
01:12:57,561 --> 01:13:00,121
- Five, four, three... - Go for it.

1846
01:13:00,121 --> 01:13:01,121
150 dollars.

1847
01:13:01,931 --> 01:13:04,821
(And there's Kwon Ryeol.)

1848
01:13:04,821 --> 01:13:06,091
(His forehead is mine.)

1849
01:13:06,091 --> 01:13:07,691
Kwon Ryeol.

1850
01:13:07,961 --> 01:13:10,061
You must be insane.

1851
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:16,091
(Jae Seok's cameraman is the winner.)

1852
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:18,091
All right. Five, four,

1853
01:13:18,091 --> 01:13:20,361
- three, two, one. - My goodness.

1854
01:13:21,861 --> 01:13:23,291
That was 150 dollars.

1855
01:13:23,861 --> 01:13:25,361
- I'm speechless. - Kwon Ryeol.

1856
01:13:25,621 --> 01:13:27,261
- Kwon Ryeol. - Hey.

1857
01:13:27,261 --> 01:13:29,291
- Come here. - I'll record this for you.

1858
01:13:30,361 --> 01:13:32,291
- Can I? - You have to leave it as memory.

1859
01:13:32,291 --> 01:13:33,821
- Record it. - Of course.

1860
01:13:33,821 --> 01:13:35,861
Take your glasses off.

1861
01:13:35,861 --> 01:13:37,861
(Running Man members are very enthusiastic.)

1862
01:13:37,861 --> 01:13:39,861
- I'm the cameraman. - What is he doing?

1863
01:13:39,861 --> 01:13:40,961
Kwon Ryeol.

1864
01:13:40,991 --> 01:13:43,821
(He even wets his hands while preparing.)

1865
01:13:43,891 --> 01:13:45,161
- Get started. - He only gets one chance...

1866
01:13:45,161 --> 01:13:47,761
so you can't do anything about it even if he doesn't do it properly.

1867
01:13:47,761 --> 01:13:49,261
- It'll be funny if he slaps hard. - Hold on.

1868
01:13:49,261 --> 01:13:50,621
I'll see how good you are. Slap my hand.

1869
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:53,721
- That's not good enough. - It's not.

1870
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:55,991
- You have to slap much harder. - Harder than how I slap Ji Hyo.

1871
01:13:55,991 --> 01:13:58,391
- What are you guys doing? - This is how hard I slap her.

1872
01:13:58,391 --> 01:14:00,821
This is how hard I slapped her forehead.

1873
01:14:01,461 --> 01:14:03,161
- I'm afraid he'll get hurt. - No, it's okay.

1874
01:14:03,161 --> 01:14:04,621
We get hurt from time to time.

1875
01:14:04,821 --> 01:14:07,161
- Hey. You're going to hurt me? - It's for 150 dollars.

1876
01:14:07,221 --> 01:14:08,791
- Why did you bet 150 dollars? - It's for 150 dollars.

1877
01:14:09,391 --> 01:14:12,021
If you're worried about hurting me, why did you pay 150 dollars?

1878
01:14:12,361 --> 01:14:14,291
- Hit him. Slap him hard. - Kwon Ryeol.

1879
01:14:15,061 --> 01:14:16,091
- No grudges, right? - Of course not.

1880
01:14:16,091 --> 01:14:17,431
Of course not.

1881
01:14:17,761 --> 01:14:20,021
- Of course not. Don't you know me? - Tell him.

1882
01:14:20,161 --> 01:14:21,391
I'm worried because it's you.

1883
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:24,431
- That's why I'm worried. - Kwon Ryeol.

1884
01:14:24,431 --> 01:14:27,661
- You can slap me. - He made a fist. Don't punch him.

1885
01:14:28,521 --> 01:14:30,591
- You're not supposed to punch him. - Don't worry about it.

1886
01:14:30,821 --> 01:14:32,091
Don't worry. You can slap me hard.

1887
01:14:32,091 --> 01:14:33,991
I won't let it go if you don't slap me hard.

1888
01:14:34,391 --> 01:14:36,891
I won't let it go if you don't slap hard.

1889
01:14:39,261 --> 01:14:40,991
Slap him hard.

1890
01:14:41,161 --> 01:14:43,261
(Slapping)

1891
01:14:43,261 --> 01:14:45,391
(That was a 150-dollars slap.)

1892
01:14:45,721 --> 01:14:47,561
- Hey. - He hit the bottom of his forehead.

1893
01:14:47,561 --> 01:14:49,021
His neck jerked backward.

1894
01:14:49,091 --> 01:14:51,221
- He whacked him. - That wasn't funny.

1895
01:14:51,791 --> 01:14:54,161
It just hurt a lot.

1896
01:14:54,691 --> 01:14:56,431
- There was no sound. - My goodness.

1897
01:14:57,261 --> 01:15:00,091
- Kwon Ryeol. - Okay.

1898
01:15:00,091 --> 01:15:03,191
(Jae Seok sets a new record with 150 dollars.)

1899
01:15:03,191 --> 01:15:04,991
I recorded it all.

1900
01:15:04,991 --> 01:15:06,121
That was hilarious.

1901
01:15:06,121 --> 01:15:08,561
Actually, let's talk about it while we're on it.

1902
01:15:08,891 --> 01:15:12,891
It seems like our cameramen are stressed about their jobs.

1903
01:15:13,361 --> 01:15:15,891
- What are you implying? - That came out of nowhere.

1904
01:15:16,691 --> 01:15:17,821
What was that for?

1905
01:15:17,821 --> 01:15:19,961
- Look at Kwon Ryeol. - That came out of nowhere.

1906
01:15:19,961 --> 01:15:21,721
- Get back. - What are you saying?

1907
01:15:21,721 --> 01:15:23,021
- Who here... - That was just for you.

1908
01:15:23,021 --> 01:15:24,261
Who wants to give it a try?

1909
01:15:24,261 --> 01:15:26,261
- What are you saying? - It's okay if you don't want to.

1910
01:15:26,491 --> 01:15:29,521
- What about you? - Yoon Sang.

1911
01:15:29,521 --> 01:15:32,061
- I was the emcee for his wedding. - Is that right?

1912
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,861
- What if you had the chance? - We text once in a while.

1913
01:15:36,061 --> 01:15:37,961
- I'm fine. - Okay.

1914
01:15:37,961 --> 01:15:39,291
(He's a loyal man.)

1915
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:40,991
That's fine. You can whisper in my ear.

1916
01:15:41,491 --> 01:15:42,621
That's sweet.

1917
01:15:43,461 --> 01:15:45,791
Gary is gone.

1918
01:15:46,961 --> 01:15:48,161
Hey, hey.

1919
01:15:48,621 --> 01:15:50,091
- I'm getting sad. - Jae Seok.

1920
01:15:50,091 --> 01:15:51,461
(Gary's cameraman is lost without him.)

1921
01:15:51,461 --> 01:15:52,761
That's Gary's cameraman.

1922
01:15:52,761 --> 01:15:55,121
- His camera was pointing up. - Hold on.

1923
01:15:55,261 --> 01:15:57,431
I guess you're here just for the sake of it.

1924
01:15:57,891 --> 01:15:59,491
He's shooting the air.

1925
01:15:59,761 --> 01:16:01,391
I was wondering what he was shooting.

1926
01:16:01,391 --> 01:16:02,591
Didn't you get the call?

1927
01:16:03,961 --> 01:16:05,191
Who are you shooting?

1928
01:16:05,191 --> 01:16:07,091
Gary's not here anymore.

1929
01:16:07,791 --> 01:16:09,091
Accept the reality.

1930
01:16:09,091 --> 01:16:10,791
(Sung Oh is a man of loyalty.)

1931
01:16:11,291 --> 01:16:14,461
Fine. Just shoot those things.

1932
01:16:14,461 --> 01:16:16,661
(Jae Seok pities him.)

1933
01:16:17,491 --> 01:16:18,931
We'll put it to good use.

1934
01:16:19,391 --> 01:16:20,791
You should at least do something.

1935
01:16:21,561 --> 01:16:23,891
- Shoot those things over there. - You should.

1936
01:16:23,891 --> 01:16:25,061
(He was hard at work shooting those things.)

1937
01:16:25,061 --> 01:16:26,061
(The next target is Seok Jin's cameraman.)

1938
01:16:26,061 --> 01:16:27,291
I don't have any complaints.

1939
01:16:27,491 --> 01:16:30,261
Are you sure? You don't have any complaints?

1940
01:16:30,291 --> 01:16:31,361
Are you sure?

1941
01:16:31,661 --> 01:16:33,461
(Whispering)

1942
01:16:35,261 --> 01:16:36,991
- What is it? - What did that brat say?

1943
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,861
(What did you say, Yoo Seok?)

1944
01:16:38,861 --> 01:16:39,861
What did he say?

1945
01:16:40,061 --> 01:16:41,261
He doesn't have any complaints...

1946
01:16:41,761 --> 01:16:43,121
other than the fact that Seok Jin isn't funny.

1947
01:16:43,121 --> 01:16:46,961
(He doesn't have any complaints except that Seok Jin isn't funny.)

1948
01:16:46,961 --> 01:16:49,491
(So that's how you've felt all this time.)

1949
01:16:49,491 --> 01:16:50,491
(He's guilty as charged.)

1950
01:16:50,491 --> 01:16:52,661
He's upset that Seok Jin doesn't get much air time despite his efforts.

1951
01:16:52,661 --> 01:16:54,091
He said Seok Jin isn't any fun to be around with.

1952
01:16:54,091 --> 01:16:56,291
(Seok Jin is at a bad spot after placing last at the auction.)

1953
01:16:56,291 --> 01:16:58,221
(What will happen next at Nambu Market?)

1954
01:16:58,591 --> 01:16:59,591
(Next week)

1955
01:17:00,091 --> 01:17:01,461
(Jeonju Tour Part 2)

1956
01:17:02,021 --> 01:17:03,791
(Following the name tag auction,)

1957
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:05,931
(it's a grocery shopping mission.)

1958
01:17:05,931 --> 01:17:06,931
(And...)

1959
01:17:07,191 --> 01:17:09,761
(the super rookie of 2016, Blackpink)

1960
01:17:12,161 --> 01:17:14,021
(They're cheerful and charming.)

1961
01:17:14,021 --> 01:17:15,961
(Watch out for their playing with fire.)

1962
01:17:16,091 --> 01:17:18,061
- You're being used. - Which celebrities did you date?

1963
01:17:20,091 --> 01:17:23,161
(Three reasons why you like Infinite Challenge more than Running Man.)

1964
01:17:23,161 --> 01:17:24,991
(Jeonju Tour Part 2, featuring Blackpink)

1965
01:17:25,461 --> 01:17:27,291
(Running Man is looking for viewers to make memories with.)

1966
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:30,061
