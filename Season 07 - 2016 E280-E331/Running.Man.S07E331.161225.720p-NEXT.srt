1
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:10,900
(Christmas is full of love and joy on the streets and in the hearts.)

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,070
(It's the only day of the year.)

3
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,600
(It feels like there will be a miracle today.)

4
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,500
Christmas season has returned.

5
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,840
- Is it Christmas already? - Merry Christmas.

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,070
- Time flies. - Merry Christmas.

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,340
For our Christmas Special,

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,770
we have invited a lovely Christmas fairy today.

9
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,000
- That's great. - Who is the Christmas fairy?

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
- We must see a fairy on Christmas. - Make us happy for once.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,870
- Who is the fairy? - That's awesome.

12
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,800
Christmas fairy, please come out.

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,070
(Running Man members have worked hard for a year.)

14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,340
(Who is the fairly to present a great Christmas for the members?)

15
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,170
There is a fairy?

16
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,340
(Christmas fairy, who are you?)

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,470
- Who is that? - My gosh.

18
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,000
(Christmas fairy, who are you?)

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,670
(Kim So Hyun is the Christmas fairy and MC for the day.)

20
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,800
(From a child actress, she grew up to be a lady.)

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,140
(So Hyun is the pretty actress with acting skills.)

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,270
(Christmas fairy has descended.)

23
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,740
- Goodness. - It's Kim So Hyun.

24
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:12,840
What are we going to do?

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,140
- Kim So Hyun is here. - I can't believe it.

26
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,440
- She does look like a fairy. - It's been a while, So Hyun.

27
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,200
- Hello. - My gosh, what brings you here?

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,770
- She sure is a fairy. - Indeed.

29
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,800
Why don't you move this way?

30
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,170
- Should I move there? - Please come this way.

31
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,300
(Fairy, please come this way.)

32
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,140
Because of her, I can't quit drinking the sports drink.

33
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,240
(She is synonymous with purity.)

34
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,500
Is that why?

35
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,970
(She promotes a sports drink.)

36
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,870
- She has turned into a lady now. - Indeed, she has.

37
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,970
My goodness.

38
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,140
- How old are you now? - I am 18 years old.

39
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,970
- She's 18 years old? - 18 years old?

40
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,540
Are you only 18 years old?

41
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,340
- Yes, I am. - Go ahead with your hosting.

42
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,770
I came here as a Christmas fairy today.

43
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,440
- You are truly a fairy. - You really are.

44
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,670
- No, I am not. - That's great.

45
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,070
But why don't you have wings?

46
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,140
(What did he just say?)

47
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,270
- What's the matter with you? - She's only 18 years old.

48
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,370
- What are you trying to do here? - I mean...

49
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,670
His lines are out-dated.

50
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,770
So Hyun, do you not like this kind of lines?

51
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,240
- So Hyun. - She acted like she didn't hear it.

52
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,400
- You hated the line he said, right? - I'm sorry.

53
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,300
She doesn't like these things. I got it. I know what she likes now.

54
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,840
- I found out what she dislikes. - It's because of me.

55
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,770
- Did you get that? - Yes, I got it.

56
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,570
- So Hyun, it's almost Christmas. - Okay.

57
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,240
What is your plan?

58
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,010
- What did you do when you were 18? - I...

59
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,900
stayed up all night with my friends.

60
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,670
- Where? Doing what? - Why did you stay up all night?

61
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,900
I had a girlfriend at that time.

62
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,770
(Shy)

63
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,300
- What did you say? - Stop lying.

64
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,340
(Is that from your imagination?)

65
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,700
- You're driving me crazy. - You didn't have a girlfriend.

66
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,040
- He thought we'd let it slide. - It's only your imagination.

67
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,270
No one liked you when you were young.

68
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,470
We played games and talked all night long.

69
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,000
My gosh, I had a great time. I wonder how they are doing.

70
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,770
(I miss you, my friends. Are you well?)

71
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,940
- Anyway... - That was great.

72
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,740
- So... - She didn't listen to my story.

73
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,100
Shouldn't you tell us your plan since we were on the subject?

74
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,570
I should make my Christmas memories here.

75
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,700
- Here? - Yes.

76
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,170
- It won't be easy. - I don't think you can.

77
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,640
She's well-prepared. She has all the answers.

78
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,270
The Christmas Special you will have with me is...

79
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,600
Christmas Race with Bad Santa.

80
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,570
(Christmas Race with Bad Santa)

81
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,670
You see the thermometer here, right?

82
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,300
Through several missions, you need to make it reach 100°C.

83
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,640
Today's race will be over then.

84
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,240
Before the race ends, you have to be each other's bad Santa.

85
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,540
- You must bully each other. - Bully each other?

86
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,970
But you can't let them know whom you are supposed to bully.

87
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,570
- Is it a secret? - Yes.

88
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,000
(Christmas with Bad Santa)

89
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,840
(Christmas with Bad Santa)

90
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,300
If you successfully bully without getting caught, 1,000 dollars...

91
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,670
- will be donated under your name. - It's a donation.

92
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,600
So we'll be doing a good deed and a bad deed together.

93
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,600
- You'll be a good Santa for others. - A bad deed will be a good deed.

94
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,440
He is the expert in bullying.

95
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,800
- No, you're the expert. - How can you let this happen?

96
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,370
I don't know whom I will be bullying,

97
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,870
but I won't be held responsibility if that person cries.

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,900
Since you let me play jokes on people...

99
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,040
When Jong Kook bullies, I can forget about it on that day.

100
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,970
When Jae Seok bullies, it lasts a week.

101
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,900
- That's right. - That's the problem with him.

102
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,600
It's going to last a week.

103
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,200
I'm worried, too.

104
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,670
I'm worried about two things.

105
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,200
First one is who will be bullied by Jong Kook.

106
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,700
Second one is who will bully Jong Kook.

107
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,940
- Please. - I'm really...

108
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,370
- Right. - I really hope...

109
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,100
- that won't be me. - Please don't let it be me.

110
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,400
- What I want to know is... - But how can you not...

111
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,940
get caught if you are to bully Jong Kook?

112
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,310
- That's inevitable. - I want to know...

113
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,170
what the limit is.

114
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,440
- I want to know the limit. - You all know Jong Kook, right?

115
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,500
- He will say, "What are you doing?" - Right.

116
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,170
"Are you the Bad Santa?"

117
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,140
- I won't be able to talk then. - That will be tough.

118
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,900
(He's warming up.)

119
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,440
Starting now, you will choose your Bad Santa.

120
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,040
I will call on each member and you will go up one by one.

121
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,840
You will choose a bag that has the name tag of the person you'll bully.

122
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,500
We will go to another room and you will...

123
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,370
come up with a list of five pranks.

124
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,600
Shall I choose?

125
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,400
I will choose now. Please.

126
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,770
Please let it be anyone, but Jong Kook.

127
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,500
(He will be okay as long as it's not Jong Kook.)

128
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,100
(He grabs a bag.)

129
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,440
(He is flustered.)

130
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,700
What am I going to do?

131
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,970
(Jae Seok is an expert in bullying. Whose Bad Santa is Jae Seok?)

132
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,540
What am I going to do?

133
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,800
I will choose this one.

134
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,570
(He already feels sorry.)

135
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,200
(It's everyone's concern. Who will be bullied by Jong Kook?)

136
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,970
(Everyone has chosen their target to bully.)

137
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,270
- It's your first time. - I picked the wrong person.

138
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,740
It's too easy to bully him.

139
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,870
(She's full of confidence.)

140
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,700
Gosh, what should I do?

141
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,270
They'll find out that it's me.

142
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,370
(Who is Kwang Soo's target?)

143
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,900
(They make a list of their bullying missions.)

144
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,600
"Stepping on their foot like it was a mistake" sounds good.

145
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,340
I'll pick "stepping on their foot".

146
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,870
That's a good one.

147
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,870
(Whose foot will he destroy?)

148
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,900
"Undoing the shoelaces".

149
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,700
"Undoing the shoelaces" shouldn't be too difficult.

150
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,000
(They write down similar things.)

151
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,970
"Pulling on the sideburns and spraying water on the face".

152
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,300
This is what I wrote so far.

153
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,670
(They finish completing their list.)

154
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,440
(Who's their Bad Santas?)

155
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,640
(Their bullying list.)

156
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,700
I tucked it in because I have a smudge.

157
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,100
- Just pull it out. - No, I want to tuck it in.

158
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,770
- Pull it out. - No.

159
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,370
- Have you started already? - Start what?

160
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,170
- Did you start your bullying? - Don't tuck it in.

161
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,270
That hurt.

162
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,600
(He starts bullying in any way he can.)

163
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,770
What's going on?

164
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,770
What's wrong?

165
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,640
(Kwang Soo steps on other members' feet.)

166
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,700
(He's warming up.)

167
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,540
- Why did you step on my foot? - I'm sorry.

168
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,840
You should do it discreetly.

169
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,670
(They fight before the mission starts.)

170
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,170
You should step on the foot discreetly.

171
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,170
(Everyone loves bullying each other.)

172
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,170
Discreetly.

173
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,940
- Has bullying started? - No.

174
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,440
Don't start yet.

175
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,770
- Haven't we started? - No.

176
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,600
- Why are we starting so late? - My goodness.

177
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,870
(It's a big mess.)

178
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,640
Gosh, what's going on here?

179
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,070
The mission starts when you get in the car.

180
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,270
- Okay. - Is that when we start?

181
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,700
- Let's go. - Shall we go?

182
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,770
- Let's go. - Let's go.

183
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,440
(They move to the next location.)

184
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
She's so cute.

185
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,770
All I can think about is bullying.

186
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,970
I want to do the ones that I didn't write on my list.

187
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,800
- They suddenly come to my mind. - Me, too.

188
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,270
I changed my mind.

189
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,040
Regardless of what I wrote on my list,

190
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,370
I'll bully the person in any way I can.

191
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,540
So Hyun, be careful since we might also bully you.

192
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,170
- We should let her know. - Something may happen to you, too.

193
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,870
- I won't stir up anything. - Anything could happen to you.

194
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,270
- It's winter. - Turn on the air conditioner.

195
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,400
It's so hot.

196
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,770
(Jae Seok bullies the wrong person.)

197
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,500
Don't do that.

198
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,670
(He waits for his chance.)

199
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,240
(He pulls Kwang Soo's sideburns.)

200
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,470
(Punching)

201
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,170
- Hey. - I didn't do it.

202
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,240
(Bullying starts right away.)

203
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,770
- I didn't do it. - Jong Kook hit me to be funny.

204
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,700
- Come on, Jong Kook. - What?

205
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,800
I don't like hurting you.

206
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,070
I told you this would happen.

207
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,070
(Scratching)

208
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,670
(Punching)

209
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,670
(It's more like a combat.)

210
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,040
You're basically hitting him.

211
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,170
(He presses her head down.)

212
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,440
Why do you always punch when you're being playful?

213
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,840
He isn't being playful. He's actually hitting me.

214
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,000
This is bullying because we don't know when or what will happen.

215
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,140
(Spraying)

216
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,170
What was that?

217
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,770
(Haha can't breathe.)

218
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,770
What was that?

219
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,410
- What was it? - Isn't that a hairspray?

220
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,540
My cheek is sticky.

221
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,070
It's a hairspray.

222
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,340
I carry it around for a reason.

223
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,570
I'll be merciless today.

224
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,970
(He pokes his eyes.)

225
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,300
(Seok Jin has no lenses in his glasses.)

226
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,670
- My hand is sticky. - Just take them off.

227
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,000
- Take them off. - Are you bullying me?

228
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,500
I think she's bullying me.

229
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,270
- Good job. - We won't go easy on you, either.

230
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,970
- Good job. - We won't go easy on you.

231
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,170
(Bullying should be fair.)

232
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,170
(Let's see.)

233
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,340
(He moves up his hair.)

234
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,340
Seok Jin hates that hairstyle the most.

235
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,740
I hate it the most. Don't push up my hair.

236
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,740
He always presses it down.

237
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,440
It's because of the shape of my head.

238
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,670
(Is that so?)

239
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,170
Goodness, stop it!

240
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,700
(He makes it worse.)

241
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,040
- I don't want my hair to go up. - That's a good thing.

242
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,100
I've never seen your hair like that.

243
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,700
(He presses it down.)

244
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,500
(Seok Jin tries to fix his hair.)

245
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
(Jae Seok spits.)

246
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,700
(He attacks Kwang Soo's head.)

247
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,070
No, don't ruin my hair!

248
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,500
I went to the hair salon today!

249
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,000
(It only takes two seconds to ruin his hair.)

250
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,540
What's wrong with you?

251
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,470
You did a good job.

252
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,540
(He'll take revenge.)

253
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,470
- Are you okay? - What's wrong?

254
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,240
(He punches everyone.)

255
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,970
(Disregarding the mission, he attacks everyone.)

256
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,800
Calm down.

257
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,910
(Will they complete their mission?)

258
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,410
- This is So Hyun. - Stop that.

259
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,470
(SBS Prism Tower in Sangam-dong)

260
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,970
(It's full of Christmas decorations.)

261
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,570
(This is Bad Santa's house.)

262
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,500
Bad Santa's Miracle Race.

263
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,270
Here's how to raise the thermometer.

264
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,470
(Anything sounds good.)

265
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,770
Do you see all these boxes of presents behind us?

266
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,370
- Yes, I do. - If you...

267
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,700
carry out the missions that are written inside the boxes,

268
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,440
you may earn a minimum of 10°C...

269
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,540
to a maximum of 30°C.

270
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,770
If you fail to carry out the mission,

271
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,870
one of you will be punished.

272
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,500
The higher bet you make, the worse your punishment will be.

273
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,470
- Keep that in mind. - The higher bet...

274
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,370
- we make? - Yes.

275
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,740
The punishment will get worse.

276
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,570
It's very easy to understand.

277
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,570
She's good.

278
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,340
She's very calm and concise.

279
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,700
- It's easy to focus on her. - I know.

280
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,840
If she had been my teacher in high school, I'd have earned all A's.

281
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,700
Don't say things like that.

282
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,270
(He deserves some bullying.)

283
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,240
- I'm sorry. - I forgot about bullying.

284
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,970
- I almost forgot. - I'm sorry.

285
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,470
I almost forgot.

286
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,500
(Thank you for reminding me.)

287
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,240
All right, how about...

288
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
(He hits Jae Seok out of nowhere.)

289
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,700
(His throat gets attacked.)

290
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,940
He hit his throat.

291
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,840
Are you my Bad Santa?

292
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,070
(Being traumatized by bullying can be intense.)

293
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,500
(Punching)

294
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,640
That was worse than mine.

295
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,070
- That really hurts. - What's wrong?

296
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,900
- You should have warned me. - What?

297
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,770
- His punches are too strong. - That's true.

298
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,140
(Here's one for you, Haha.)

299
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,500
That must hurt a lot.

300
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,840
Now,

301
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,770
we'll start "Raise the Thermometer".

302
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,140
- Please pick a box. - Shall we?

303
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,270
- Let's do it. - All right.

304
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,800
- Do we pick only 1? - It's 1 per person.

305
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,000
Do we pick one?

306
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,240
Shall I pick a small one?

307
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,500
I'll pick this one.

308
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,070
- This one? - It has Santa Claus on it.

309
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,540
That box stands out the most.

310
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,940
I'm afraid its mission will be difficult.

311
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,870
(In the first box,)

312
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,340
(what kind of mission will they find?)

313
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,000
(The first mission is "Guess the Game".)

314
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,170
- What's "Guess the Game"? - What's that?

315
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,500
You'll be given a tool and hashtags. Based on those,

316
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,070
guess the game you played on Running Man...

317
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,100
and make your temperature bet.

318
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,970
It's one of the games we've played.

319
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,000
- We'll know based on the hashtags. - It'll be easy to guess.

320
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,270
We'll play this game based on the hints, right?

321
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,600
(You must be quick to succeed.)

322
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,740
(Here's the first hint.)

323
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,140
I know what it is. It's breaking boiled eggs.

324
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,140
(There are 12 eggs.)

325
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,770
Here's the hashtags.

326
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,340
The hashtags are "raw eggs", "couple", "Seok Jin and Kwang Soo".

327
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,740
(Raw eggs, couple, Seok Jin and Kwang Soo)

328
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,170
Let's think carefully. One of them is "couple".

329
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,900
- What does it refer to? - One of them is "Seok Jin".

330
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,670
- Why is it me and Kwang Soo? - Neither of them are lucky.

331
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,140
- Oh, I know what it is. - Neither of them are lucky.

332
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,340
It's because we played the final round at Unluckiest Festival.

333
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,970
- That's right. - It's the final round.

334
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,440
- It's the final round. - That's right.

335
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:38,840
(Unluckiest Festival on March 27, 2016)

336
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,000
(To determine the unluckiest one,)

337
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,440
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo competed in the final round.)

338
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,570
(That day, they used their unlucky energy to its fullest.)

339
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:54,640
(Kwang Soo showed off his unlucky energy in the raw egg game.)

340
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,700
(It's "Random Raw Egg".)

341
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,700
- Who's the unluckiest? - It was about that.

342
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,870
- It was at Unluckiest Festival. - Right.

343
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,870
- This is it. - I'm not sure.

344
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,870
(It doesn't seem right.)

345
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,740
(Water Fairy Race on March 15, 2015)

346
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,440
(They played "Making Eggs Stand" at a rest stop.)

347
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,270
(Episode 28 of Running Man on January 30, 2011)

348
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:25,240
(Joong Ki and Kwang Soo played "Rock-Paper-Scissors Eating Eggs".)

349
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,370
Rock-paper-scissors.

350
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,370
(Something doesn't feel right.)

351
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,800
- Please make your bet first. - Let's do that.

352
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,870
- 30. - Shall we bet 30?

353
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,770
- Let's bet 30. - Isn't it too high at first?

354
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,370
How about 20? It's in the middle.

355
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,700
- 20 is good. - Let's bet 20.

356
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,500
- How about 20? - I bet 20.

357
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,600
There isn't much of a difference between 20 and 30.

358
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,770
Raise your hand for 20.

359
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,170
Five people are in favor of 20. Voting is pointless.

360
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,170
(Don't you know democracy?)

361
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,170
Please talk to him, So Hyun.

362
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,270
(What did I do?)

363
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,440
Please decide for us.

364
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,370
- Let's go with 20. - Okay.

365
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,470
- We don't know the outcome. - It probably hurt his feelings.

366
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,170
It's okay, I'm fine.

367
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,170
Ready, set.

368
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,170
- Challenge. - Challenge.

369
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,540
The time limit is five minutes.

370
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,970
(Is there a time limit?)

371
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,640
Hurry up and choose.

372
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,600
(Here's the answer to the first round of "Guess the Game".)

373
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
(Time limit is five minutes.)

374
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,470
(It's "Protecting Raw Eggs".)

375
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,970
(Dangerous Brides on April 26, 2015)

376
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,170
(It's not "Random Raw Eggs".)

377
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,270
(The game is protecting the raw eggs until the end.)

378
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:29,070
(In the 5 minutes, if 1 person breaks all the eggs, they fail.)

379
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,270
(They must protect the eggs with care.)

380
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,540
Two for Kwang Soo.

381
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,470
(They try to guess which ones are boiled.)

382
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,640
Keep them in with you.

383
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,770
- Let's go. - These are raw eggs.

384
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,670
- I'm doomed. - I don't know which one is raw.

385
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
- Are these all raw? - May I see one?

386
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,240
(May I see one?)

387
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,270
Wait a minute.

388
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,170
(Why did So Hyun...)

389
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,900
(break the egg?)

390
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,270
(She cracks it open.)

391
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,800
- What happened? - Why did you do that?

392
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,770
What did you just do?

393
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,000
(They're all startled.)

394
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,240
(The judges approach them.)

395
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,070
This must be a different game.

396
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,270
- What's going on? - Oh, dear.

397
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,340
What's wrong?

398
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,600
What is this?

399
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,470
- Why are you doing this? - What are you doing?

400
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,640
(Their eggs get taken away.)

401
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,300
Why? What are you doing?

402
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,000
- Why are you doing this? - Why?

403
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,170
- Why? - What are you doing?

404
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,270
(Eggs are so expensive these days. The judges cracked all of them.)

405
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,670
Mission failed.

406
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,170
- Why? - Why?

407
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,700
- This mission... - I shouldn't be happy.

408
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,170
- What was this about? - What is it?

409
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,400
- What was that, So Hyun? - Why was she happy?

410
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,500
- This is strange. - We didn't play a game like this.

411
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,540
- We did. - Did we?

412
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,540
We played the game where we had to crack eggs.

413
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,300
It was Dangerous Wives special with Jessi.

414
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,370
Sorry?

415
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:51,540
("Protect the Raw Eggs")

416
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:58,340
(The game was played in pairs.)

417
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:04,000
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo ruined the game for everybody...)

418
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,070
(and they were humiliated.)

419
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:14,400
(Raw eggs, Couples, Seok Jin and Kwang Soo)

420
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,670
- It was in Dangerous Wives special. - That's right.

421
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,700
Sorry?

422
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,940
- Right, Jessi. - We were at a grocery store.

423
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,000
- That's right. - Right.

424
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,540
- Do Yeon was my partner. - It was "Protect the Raw Eggs".

425
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,670
- It was "Protect the Raw Eggs". - That's right. I remember.

426
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,000
I remember because Jessi cracked the egg in my mouth.

427
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,540
Even if we all succeeded, Jae Seok already failed...

428
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,040
You can't.

429
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,610
Exactly.

430
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,900
You can't.

431
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,500
- What? He put the egg in. - No way.

432
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,370
- It can't be. - What?

433
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,070
- He put the egg under your shirt. - You must have cracked it.

434
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,370
Really?

435
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,170
- Really? - It got cracked?

436
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,300
I didn't crack it.

437
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,540
I just put it in.

438
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,870
- Did it crack? - Really?

439
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,000
- I just put it in. Did it crack? - I think it did.

440
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,170
- It didn't crack. - It didn't.

441
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,900
- It must have cracked. - Hey.

442
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,700
It didn't crack.

443
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,170
What is he doing?

444
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,340
(Why is Jong Kook working so hard?)

445
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,970
One person has to be punished.

446
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:05,500
The person who couldn't protect their egg is Jae Seok.

447
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,110
- I think Jae Seok deserves it. - He was the first one to fail.

448
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,140
- Do you have one left? - Yes, I do.

449
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,440
- You have one left? - Yes.

450
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,040
Let's pick the person who still has one left.

451
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,770
- You pass. - I pass, right?

452
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,540
Both of my eggs cracked...

453
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,170
but Seok Jin's cracked first.

454
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,770
I saw them losing their eggs first...

455
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,240
and just followed.

456
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,240
What about the two of you...

457
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,970
pull on each other's sideburns...

458
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,470
and whoever makes a noise first loses?

459
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,170
- Get set, - Don't pull too hard.

460
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,640
Whoever makes a noise first...

461
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,610
- is the loser, okay? - Sure.

462
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,110
In 1, 2, 3.

463
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,270
(First one to scream loses.)

464
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,110
(They don't know what the punishment is so they must avoid it.)

465
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,800
(Their sideburns must endure.)

466
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,800
(Who will take the punishment?)

467
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,240
(They show no mercy from the beginning.)

468
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,070
They're all resisting.

469
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,540
(They're about to rip each other's scalp.)

470
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,700
That looks painful.

471
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,000
(They're about to rip each other's scalp.)

472
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,500
(Seok Jin lets go.)

473
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,640
Let's take a break.

474
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,170
(He wants to take a break all of a sudden.)

475
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,470
He's done.

476
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,110
He let go first.

477
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,240
No, that was a break.

478
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,610
You can't do that.

479
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,500
- It's Seok Jin. - That's not how you play.

480
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,970
(He was in so much pain.)

481
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,540
That was so painful.

482
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,070
- Okay. - Let's take a short break.

483
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,340
It's Seok Jin.

484
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,740
What is the punishment, anyway?

485
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,370
(What would the box contain?)

486
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:22,040
(They haven't seen it before.)

487
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,400
What is that?

488
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,400
(What is that smoke?)

489
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,970
- What's that? - I see something.

490
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,340
I don't like scary things.

491
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,000
Why is today's special scary?

492
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,440
Don't do this. Don't try to startle me.

493
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,240
Seok Jin, put your head in the box.

494
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:48,770
(He has to put his head in the box?)

495
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,170
- My head? - I hate this.

496
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,340
That's good.

497
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,900
(His eyes move fast.)

498
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,670
- You want him to put his head in? - Like this?

499
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,970
Is there a crocodile in there with its mouth open?

500
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,640
He'll come back alive, right?

501
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,840
- This is it, right? - My goodness.

502
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,700
What am I supposed to do?

503
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,610
(He puts on protective goggles.)

504
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,040
I can't see anything at all.

505
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,800
What is it?

506
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,670
- I don't know. - There must be something.

507
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,940
I'd rather get slapped a few hundred times.

508
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,840
(There's the fear of the unknown.)

509
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,110
One...

510
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,170
(I'm getting nervous too.)

511
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,300
Two...

512
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,610
(He merely wanted to take a break but this is too cruel.)

513
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,970
In 1, 2, 3.

514
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,900
(What is the punishment that awaits Seok Jin?)

515
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,570
What is it?

516
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,040
Does he have to kiss somebody?

517
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,070
(That doesn't sound too pleasant.)

518
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,140
Six, seven,

519
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,870
- What's that? - What's that?

520
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,870
- I'm scared. - What's that?

521
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,400
Is it a crocodile?

522
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,940
What was that? It felt like a tongue.

523
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:50,040
(Why is there a tongue?)

524
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,700
(What was the punishment?)

525
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,800
- What is it? - Oh, my goodness.

526
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,400
(His faced got covered in ink.)

527
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,700
(It makes the rest of them walk away.)

528
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,770
- I don't like the look of that. - He startled me.

529
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:07,070
(It's as if only his body is floating in air.)

530
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,610
- Oh, my goodness. - What?

531
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,870
What was that?

532
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,540
- What? - What was that?

533
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,140
It looks hideous.

534
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,500
What was it?

535
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,000
What's this?

536
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,440
It's ink?

537
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,110
What happened to my teeth?

538
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,140
Look.

539
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,840
(That was only worth 20°C.)

540
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,000
It keeps on spreading the more you wipe it.

541
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,370
(Grabbing)

542
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,770
(Punching)

543
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,770
- Hey. - I'm sorry.

544
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,270
I'm sorry.

545
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,900
- This is what the game does to you. - I'm sorry.

546
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,500
It's not going away.

547
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,740
That looks great.

548
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,000
(He looks like a hard worker.)

549
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,840
Let's just go with this.

550
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,400
Let's do this until the end.

551
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,800
We have to be smart with our choices.

552
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,570
- That's right. - We have to.

553
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,270
- Let's do better. - I understand now.

554
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,740
- Let's succeed. - This is no joke.

555
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,970
(Here's the hint for the next game.)

556
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,440
- What is this? - Gary's back?

557
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,470
- Gary's back again? - Gary knows something.

558
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,400
The second tool is Gary's name tag.

559
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,300
- "Unclean". - "7012" and "Apgujeong".

560
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,240
This sounds recent.

561
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,600
What's "unclean"?

562
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,170
It was recent.

563
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,170
What did we do the day after Gary quit?

564
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,070
- What did we do? - We were unclean?

565
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,470
- What did we do? - We went to Han River.

566
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,870
- Our farewell was unclean. - We went to the photo booth.

567
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,640
- We made stickers out of it. - We went to the karaoke.

568
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,870
- That was unclean. - What about this name tag?

569
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,940
Like I said,

570
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:30,570
they might have put something obvious as a trap.

571
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,400
We should think about it another way.

572
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,940
What's "unclean"?

573
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,100
What kind of games have we played involving "7012"?

574
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,240
There was a storage.

575
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,640
The lock code was 7012.

576
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,170
- It was a diamond pattern. - Underneath the bed...

577
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,370
(It was the first time that they used 7012.)

578
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,640
- Look for it. - Gary was trapped.

579
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,600
Do we have to find Gary and stick this on his back?

580
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,940
(Is Gary here?)

581
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,070
- Gary... - Is he here?

582
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,570
(Is Gary disguised as a staff member?)

583
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,700
Let's bet 30°C and try it.

584
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,440
Should we try 20°C first?

585
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,140
- Sure, let's do 20°C. - Let's do that.

586
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,240
- We'll start once you're ready. - Okay.

587
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,300
- Let's go. - Go.

588
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,870
- I think we have to find him. - Really?

589
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,440
It might be somebody related to Gary.

590
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,500
- This is helpful. - In 1, 2, 3.

591
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,600
- Start. - Start.

592
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,140
You have five minutes.

593
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,170
- Look for him. - That's it?

594
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,170
- Yes, that's it. - Gary must be here.

595
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,700
- That's it? - Yes.

596
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,470
- Really? - We have his name tag.

597
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,870
- His name tag... - We have to find him.

598
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,970
It might be something related to him.

599
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,000
(The second game is "Find Mini Name Tags".)

600
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,840
- Is Gary really here? - Gary?

601
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,370
(Running Man can't break up with Gary and he can't leave.)

602
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,100
(They called Gary back for one last time.)

603
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:48,870
(They had to find mini name tags in Gary's studio.)

604
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,470
(They have to find 6 name tags in 5 minutes.)

605
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,540
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

606
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,440
- Look for him. - Yes, Jae Seok.

607
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,640
(Gary can't be here.)

608
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,370
He must be somewhere close.

609
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,940
- Gary. - Try calling Gary, Kwang Soo.

610
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,500
- I'm calling him right now. - Gary.

611
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,100
7012 and Gary.

612
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,670
Gary.

613
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,540
(Where are you, Gary?)

614
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,340
Gary... Hold on...

615
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,100
What game involved Gary's name tag?

616
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,940
- Gary. - Gary.

617
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,040
- Seok Jin. - Yes?

618
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,600
- I can't see you in the dark. - Hey.

619
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,900
Don't we have to find name tags? We played it at his place.

620
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,840
- What was that? - Those small name tags.

621
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,640
- Those small name tags. - That's right.

622
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,340
- Look for something white. - We have to find name tags.

623
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,870
Look for name tags.

624
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,140
- Look for name tags. - Come here. Isn't that it?

625
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,400
- Small name tags. - They're white for sure.

626
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,540
- Look for small name tags. - Small name tags.

627
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,240
- I found one. It's Kwang Soo's. - Really?

628
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,700
- It's Kwang Soo's. - I found one.

629
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,870
- It's here. - We have to find all of ours.

630
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,540
- Our name tags? - You found one?

631
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,170
- I found Kwang Soo's. - You guys are amazing.

632
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,600
I can't believe he found it.

633
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,270
- I found Haha's. - Okay.

634
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,070
- I found Haha's. - We have to find all our name tags.

635
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,540
- Let's succeed this time. - We found Kwang Soo's.

636
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,940
I told you we should bet 30°C.

637
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,300
We don't even know if we'll succeed. What are you talking about?

638
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,540
(We might fail. What are you talking about?)

639
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,000
- He's just... - I found myself.

640
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,040
- Did you? - Really?

641
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,470
- Ji Hyo, can you find mine? - How did you all find it?

642
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,840
Ji Hyo, can you find mine?

643
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,770
You're going to be punished if you don't find your own.

644
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,370
- Ji Hyo. - Find some more.

645
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:19,970
- Ji Hyo, can you find mine? - I'm looking for it right now.

646
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,170
Ji Hyo.

647
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,740
- It's here. - Where?

648
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,870
- Jae Seok's is here. - You found mine.

649
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,170
(You found mine.)

650
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,000
I didn't even find mine. What am I doing?

651
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,970
- Your shoes. - Where is it?

652
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,900
- In ten, - Just a second.

653
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,640
- nine, - Sir.

654
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,500
- eight, - Give us 30 more seconds.

655
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,100
- seven, - Give us 30 more seconds.

656
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,740
- six, - Okay.

657
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,540
- five... - Did you find it?

658
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,400
I found one but it's Seok Jin's.

659
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,670
Four...

660
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,000
(Seok Jin runs for it.)

661
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,240
- Stop. - Hold on.

662
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,270
- Two... - What's next?

663
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,600
(Time's up and they fail their second game.)

664
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,140
We didn't find Jong Kook's name tag.

665
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,800
- We only had one left. - Time's out.

666
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,940
Should a person who found nothing go?

667
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,400
Or should the owner of the name tag that we didn't find go?

668
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,570
But I supervised and controlled the whole game.

669
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:07,000
No, you should go since you didn't find anything.

670
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,340
- Let's have a vote. - No, that's not right.

671
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,400
Okay, let's shuffle the name tags.

672
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,740
Let So Hyun choose one name tag and that person will go.

673
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,670
- Whoever remains should go. - Whoever is picked will survive.

674
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,840
Okay, whoever is chosen won't have to go.

675
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,040
- Whoever is left will have to go. - You saw me, right?

676
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,400
You saw how horrible the punishment can be.

677
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,740
- Okay, So Hyun. Please choose one. - Please.

678
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,470
(To avoid the punishment, the name tag has to be drawn out.)

679
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,600
This person won't face the punishment.

680
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,500
(Who is the first person who will be exempt from the punishment?)

681
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,170
- Who is it? - Yes!

682
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,340
(What a surprise. It's Kwang Soo.)

683
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,540
Okay, then. Kwang Soo will face the punishment.

684
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,800
That's it.

685
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,370
You can't do this to me.

686
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,400
- He's not bullying me. - He is.

687
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,900
No, it can't be. Are you my Bad Santa?

688
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,470
- Are you supposed to bully me? - Fine.

689
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,700
- You're not, right? - Okay.

690
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,700
- We will let you pass. - That was...

691
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,040
- That was the rule. - We will let you pass.

692
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,500
- We will let Kwang Soo pass. - It could've been funny.

693
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,270
So Hyun, please choose my name tag. Is it mine?

694
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,170
- It's Jong Kook. - That's right. Jong Kook is exempt.

695
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,140
(He smiles brightly.)

696
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,140
(Third person to be exempt is surprisingly Seok Jin.)

697
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,140
This is no fun.

698
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,540
- It's Ji Hyo. - My gosh.

699
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,500
- This is crazy. - It's either one of you.

700
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,340
You are not doing this on purpose, right?

701
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,570
(Only Jae Seok and Haha remain.)

702
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,170
- It might be Haha again. - It will be one of you.

703
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,500
- It will be funny if it's Haha. - How can this happen again?

704
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,170
(Who will get to experience the punishment?)

705
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:25,600
(Please...)

706
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,870
- This person will be exempt, right? - Okay!

707
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,470
This is great.

708
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,240
(Jae Seok is chosen. Haha is exempt.)

709
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,770
This is great.

710
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,600
- This is awesome. - Jae Seok will...

711
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,470
You are chosen to face the punishment.

712
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,640
- It won't be the same, will it? - No, it won't be.

713
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,170
- Don't open your mouth. - Will it be the same?

714
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,500
Just have your mouth closed.

715
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,870
I'm telling you. It's a horrendous place.

716
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,400
- What could it be? - I can hear them getting ready.

717
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,570
What are they ripping there?

718
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,000
- Can I put my hands first? - No, you can't.

719
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,040
- My goodness. - Don't put your hands in.

720
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,670
- Get ready. - It's only 10 seconds.

721
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,470
Someone is already here.

722
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,940
- They are well-prepared. - Jae Seok.

723
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,700
We are the country of the courteous people.

724
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,770
Get ready. He went in.

725
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,540
- It started. - What is that?

726
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,970
(He has to endure it for 10 seconds.)

727
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,170
My gosh. What is it?

728
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,570
- It's no joke. - What is it?

729
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,600
Are you rubbing something?

730
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,170
- It's crazy. They're rubbing it. - Is it perfume?

731
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,170
- What is this? - It's only 20°C.

732
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,940
- Is it 20 or 30? - It's 20.

733
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,440
(Shivering)

734
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,440
(Get out now. It's past 10 seconds.)

735
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,700
- Why isn't he coming out? - They must be holding him.

736
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,140
(He is coming back, right?)

737
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,300
(The second victim raises his head.)

738
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,740
(Everyone is curious to see him.)

739
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,240
- Why isn't he coming out? - They must be holding him.

740
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,540
(How will Jae Seok look after facing the punishment?)

741
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,840
What is that?

742
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,670
- It wasn't ink? - My goodness.

743
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,070
That scared me.

744
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,070
- That caught me off guard. - Did you see him?

745
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,270
(His face is colorful like a tree.)

746
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,270
Are you okay, Jae Seok?

747
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:57,700
(This is the Christmas I dreamed of.)

748
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,170
(Please leave me alone. I want to be left alone.)

749
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,300
Is he crying?

750
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,670
He is really crying. Please give us some tissue.

751
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,040
This hurts so much.

752
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,340
- Does it hurt? - Jae Seok.

753
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,240
- My gosh. - Here's tissue.

754
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,970
- How can you do such a thing? - Goodness.

755
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,240
You just made him...

756
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,670
(Now, it's beginning to look like Christmas.)

757
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,640
Shouldn't you experience something like this, too?

758
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,700
Right, you are on a variety show.

759
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,100
- Okay, the third... - She's professional.

760
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,940
- She is professional. - She's so good.

761
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,600
- But she's so cold. - Right.

762
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,870
You're good at this, but you are cold-hearted.

763
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,640
- Please bring in the toy hammer. - It's the toy hammer.

764
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,940
(The hint for the third round is a toy hammer.)

765
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,370
- What episode was that in? - My gosh.

766
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,770
We did a lot of games with this.

767
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,640
We popped the head with it. I mean the balloons.

768
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,040
- What? - Agility?

769
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,370
- There's a heart? - What is this?

770
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,770
- You popped what? - "The back of the head"?

771
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,170
(The hashtags are agility, heart, and the back of the head.)

772
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,900
- Here's the toy hammer. - Can this be the game on agility?

773
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,570
- We covered our heads with a pot. - The one with the pot?

774
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,300
(The Heirs Special was 166th episode of Running Man in 2013.)

775
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:05,670
(It's the first game with the toy hammer that came into his mind.)

776
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,800
(But how does the heart fit into this game?)

777
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,040
- We had balloons on our heads. - I remember.

778
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,840
It's the game we had balloons on the back of our head.

779
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:19,600
(Is it the game we popped the balloons with the toy hammer?)

780
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,240
But how is "heart" related?

781
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:27,700
(Agaility and back of the head are difficult to figure out.)

782
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,140
This is it. The heart...

783
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,000
- Right, it's the game we glued it. - We had to...

784
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,440
It's when Lee Joon Gi appeared on the show.

785
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,970
(The game they played with Joon Gi)

786
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:38,840
(Game of Emperor's Throne was 314th episode.)

787
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,870
(They had to remove the hearts...)

788
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,900
(on the back of their heads with a toy hammer.)

789
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,240
(Is this game right?)

790
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,270
- This is the one with heart. - That sounds right.

791
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,100
- It's the game with Joon Gi. - That's right.

792
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,740
Let's not rush into a decision. We did that before.

793
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,940
- We might... - It doesn't matter if we rush...

794
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,970
or not because we are the ones who face the punishment anyway.

795
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,000
- I mean... - You didn't face it.

796
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,340
I bet it's my turn next since these two already got it.

797
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,540
- This is so odd. - Just put me in that box already.

798
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,170
- We'll end up facing it again. - It's between us three.

799
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,700
I'm the only one left.

800
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,840
- See? - What is the next punishment?

801
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,140
How much will you be betting?

802
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,240
- Let's bet 30. - Let's go with 30.

803
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,870
- So Hyun, this is... - We'll fail anyway.

804
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,170
- In 1, 2, 3. - Start.

805
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,470
- The time limit is five minutes. - That's too long.

806
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,270
(Backing away)

807
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,570
When she said the time limit, she backed away.

808
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,040
(Hold on. Does So Hyun...)

809
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,000
- She backed away when she said it. - I was just giving you space.

810
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,600
How will I avoid them for five minutes?

811
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,370
Why isn't anyone coming?

812
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,900
Is this it?

813
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,070
Why isn't anyone coming? Is this it?

814
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,640
(He found a heart as soon as he started.)

815
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,440
- What is that? - Seriously?

816
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,600
(Wait, this heart is from the game with Joon Gi.)

817
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,370
(They hunted for hearts with the toy hammer in the episode.)

818
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,000
- What is it? - Seriously?

819
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,170
I found it.

820
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,740
(Beep)

821
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,900
That isn't...

822
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:57,000
- That's not how it should be done. - You just hit her.

823
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,340
- "Back of the head". - Did you hit her?

824
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,870
- This was the mission. - Okay.

825
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,270
- Wasn't that amazing? - How did you figure it out?

826
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,870
- That was great. - You successfully completed it.

827
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,140
- How did you figure it out? - As soon as we started,

828
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,240
- she moved back a bit. - Right, she did.

829
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,400
I was wondering why she moved back.

830
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,970
Haha, we collected 30°C.

831
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,140
- I wish it was 40°C. - You got it since you succeeded.

832
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,040
- This is the first. - Great.

833
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,940
- I bet the staff was disappointed. - Right.

834
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,300
- I'll do the slate. - Which one is me? I can't tell.

835
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,340
One, two, and three.

836
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,000
(Punching)

837
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,140
(Kwang Soo got hit in the stomach.)

838
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:35,640
(Seok Jin writes on his name tag.)

839
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,300
How can you try to complete a mission now?

840
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,600
(Let me take your shoe since you are lying down.)

841
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,740
(They remove his name tag and throw his shoe away.)

842
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:49,640
(They are like hyenas attacking their prey. It's a chaos.)

843
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,040
(It's a party for the bullies.)

844
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:59,540
(They try to bully anyone whenever there's a chance.)

845
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,940
(Kicking)

846
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,140
Hey.

847
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,940
(They give a massage and cold water therapy for Seok Jin.)

848
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,070
- Someone bullied me, too. - Who is my Bad Santa?

849
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,240
- Who is it? - I can't figure it out.

850
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,470
You will open the window and confess how many times...

851
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,400
- you bullied so far. - I think Jong Kook picked me.

852
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,800
- But that will be too extreme. - I think everyone picked me.

853
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,040
(What is the result?)

854
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,070
(It's "Bully's Confession".)

855
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,140
Which window? That window?

856
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,270
I managed to do four things from the list.

857
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,000
I stepped on the foot, rubbed ink on the face,

858
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,670
threw the shoe,

859
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,740
and poked the cheek.

860
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,740
(Like an expert, he is fast and accurate.)

861
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,800
(It's hard to count how many times Jae Seok bullied.)

862
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,400
(He threw three people's shoes.)

863
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,770
My gosh, Jae Seok.

864
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,640
(He bullies everyone randomly. Whose Bad Santa is he really?)

865
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,740
It's so hard to guess who my Bad Santa is.

866
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,970
(Whose Bad Santa is Jae Seok?)

867
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:04,400
Out of 5, I successfully did 4.

868
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,140
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin are tied.)

869
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,440
I put spray on the person in the car.

870
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:14,770
I managed to pull the side hair luckily during the game.

871
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,040
Haha, Kwang Soo, and I pulled the side hair.

872
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,800
I pulled the side hair at that moment.

873
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:26,270
(It was to decide who would face the punishment.)

874
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,570
(Whose Bad Santa is Seok Jin out of these two?)

875
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,510
I hit the person hard.

876
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,700
(Surprisingly, he's not doing so well.)

877
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,010
I put something in their clothes. I completed two so far.

878
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,240
(He only managed to do two on the list.)

879
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,840
It's me.

880
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,940
(He punches.)

881
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,300
If you hit like that, I won't give this to you.

882
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,240
(He managed to hit really hard twice.)

883
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,340
- Because Jae Seok failed... - Right.

884
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:52,240
(He mostly attacked Jae Seok and Haha.)

885
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,100
(Who is his real target?)

886
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,570
I untied the shoelace...

887
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,940
(Haha's list of pranks)

888
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,740
and splashed water on the face.

889
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,870
(After checking, he only managed to do one.)

890
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,340
I did two.

891
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,400
I stepped on the person.

892
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,670
(He completed 4 like a bullying mania.)

893
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:15,010
I splashed water on the body.

894
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,040
(He is an expert in bullying.)

895
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,700
I untied the shoelace.

896
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,010
(He's in the lead.)

897
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,340
I hit the throat when the person was talking.

898
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,740
I completed four on the list.

899
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:28,170
I completed one by removing the glasses.

900
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,510
I still have a long way to go.

901
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:37,670
(Status Report on Bullying)

902
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,100
Jae Seok, 3 of us did 4 so far.

903
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,070
- Really? - I heard...

904
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,900
- No wonder. - How can the 3 of us do 4?

905
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,800
No one can beat us when it comes to bullying.

906
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,840
- I'm so proud. - The confession...

907
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,870
- has finished. - But I don't know who picked me.

908
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,300
- I don't know that, either. - Right.

909
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:56,300
We prepared "Guess Your Santa" for those who suffered from bullying.

910
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:02,970
For this game, choose one member whom you think is your Bad Santa.

911
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:07,370
Take them to Room of Truth.

912
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,870
If you guess the right member,

913
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:13,440
your Bad Santa will turn into Rudolph and serve you as the master.

914
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,010
And they will receive the final punishment.

915
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,140
If you guess the wrong member,

916
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,770
the member you chose will spank you five times.

917
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:23,540
(The member you choose will spank you five times if you guess wrong.)

918
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,510
I'm sure it wasn't easy even for Jong Kook to bully discreetly.

919
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,540
That means all three of you did four types of bullying.

920
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,940
- They almost finished. - They don't say a word.

921
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,070
(They stay silent.)

922
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,170
Please continue what you're saying.

923
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,970
I think they picked ones that are easy to bully.

924
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,540
Let's take a guess.

925
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,800
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

926
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,300
(They decide who will guess first.)

927
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,740
- I won. - My gosh.

928
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,070
- Did Jong Kook win? - At once.

929
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,940
(Open, Room of Truth.)

930
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,770
Gosh, Jong Kook always wins at a time like this.

931
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:54,670
I don't think it'll be fun for me to guess.

932
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,370
One of you three should guess.

933
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:58,300
- Give us a chance. - Should I?

934
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,870
- Give me a chance. - Give me a chance.

935
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,040
- Jong Kook. - To whom?

936
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,440
Please give it to me.

937
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,770
- I think I know who it is. - Please, Jong Kook.

938
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,070
I'll bring Rudolph and come back to you.

939
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,670
(He'll bring Rudolph to Jong Kook.)

940
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,670
- Please, Jong Kook. - Give it to me.

941
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:14,870
(They beg him to give them a chance.)

942
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:17,070
(Kissing)

943
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,670
I know who it is. Please give me a chance.

944
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,300
- I'll give it to Kwang Soo. - Yes.

945
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,440
(Kwang Soo gets a chance.)

946
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,770
He could take a wrong guess.

947
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,540
- This is driving me crazy. - Goodness.

948
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,600
Come with me, Rudolph.

949
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,440
(He beckons Jae Seok.)

950
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,670
(Get ready to turn into Rudolph.)

951
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,670
Come with me.

952
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,540
- Hurry up. - My goodness.

953
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,340
Run, Rudolph.

954
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,510
(Kwang Soo picks Jae Seok.)

955
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,700
Oh my goodness.

956
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,370
I asked you to give me a chance.

957
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,700
- Let's go. - Good luck.

958
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,770
Kwang Soo is driving me crazy.

959
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,870
(Is Jae Seok Kwang Soo's Bad Santa?)

960
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,700
- Come in, my Rudolph. - My goodness.

961
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,140
(Everyone gets excited about what's going on.)

962
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,670
- I think he's right. - We have a long way to go.

963
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,470
- I think Jae Seok is it. - Really?

964
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:02,040
(It's the first guess. Will Kwang Soo be spanked?)

965
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,670
(Or will Jae Seok turn into Kwang Soo's Rudolph?)

966
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,070
Kwang Soo's Santa is...

967
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,300
(Or will Jae Seok turn into Kwang Soo's Rudolph?)

968
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,970
Bell of truth.

969
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,170
(Is Kwang Soo right or wrong?)

970
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,470
- Please ring. - Ring.

971
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,010
Rudolph, just come out.

972
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,370
(What happened in Room of Truth?)

973
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,170
Rudolph, just come out.

974
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:29,400
(Kwang Soo will be spanked.)

975
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,640
Oh my goodness.

976
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,510
(He guessed wrong.)

977
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,470
That looks hilarious.

978
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,770
(He's the master of bullies.)

979
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:41,940
I think Kwang Soo had a misunderstanding.

980
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,170
I'm sorry. He bullied me more than 30 times today,

981
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,070
but those were without any reason.

982
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,770
- Please spank him hard. - Okay.

983
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:51,870
You have to spank me five times, so go easy at first.

984
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,940
(It's the result of Kwang Soo's wrong guess.)

985
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,370
(Merry Spanking Christmas)

986
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,300
- That's really painful. - My gosh.

987
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,870
- What did he do so wrong? - It's for when you punish someone.

988
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,600
- He's completely fine. - Rudolph.

989
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,700
Come here, Rudolph.

990
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,270
(Get ready to become Rudolph, Seok Jin.)

991
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,170
- Rudolph. - Who's his Rudolph?

992
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,700
(Is one of them his Bad Santa?)

993
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,800
- Where's my Rudolph? - Who is it?

994
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,240
(They earn 30°C after the first mission.)

995
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,510
That's it for "Guess the Game".

996
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,670
The second mission is called "Childlike Missions".

997
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,440
- "Childlike Missions"? - Let's move to the kindergarten.

998
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,700
- Let's go. - Okay.

999
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,770
(What kind of mission awaits them?)

1000
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,540
(Wow, it's Running Man.)

1001
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:35,470
For the children to live in a beautiful world,

1002
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:38,070
- Right. - we must make it.

1003
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,440
- That's right. - We must change this world.

1004
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,240
Please walk on the right side.

1005
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,870
For the world to be just...

1006
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:48,170
(What's the next mission at the kindergarten?)

1007
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:50,170
- Where shall we go? - There are many boys, too.

1008
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,340
(What kind of dance is that?)

1009
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,300
They look like they're five years old.

1010
00:39:55,300 --> 00:40:03,140
(It's a lovely dance by children who wait for Santa Claus.)

1011
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,600
- We can do anything - We can do anything

1012
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,770
(What's the "Childlike Missions" these children prepared?)

1013
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,900
Look at the child in the back. He's the only one not dancing.

1014
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,400
He isn't dancing.

1015
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,070
(He doesn't care.)

1016
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,540
He's too shy.

1017
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,800
I couldn't go to a kindergarten.

1018
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,170
I went to a kindergarten.

1019
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,570
Me, too.

1020
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:22,770
(He's proud.)

1021
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:25,470
- Kindergarten - Kindergarten

1022
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,800
Why are all the kindergarten songs the same?

1023
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,770
- For nice and cute children - For nice and cute children

1024
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,940
(This is the song.)

1025
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:35,140
I thought only my kindergarten had a song.

1026
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,970
There are three tasks for "Childlike Missions".

1027
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:43,340
1st is hearing a specific comment from a child within 3 minutes.

1028
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,470
- That's really difficult. - It is.

1029
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:51,970
2nd is keeping 15 children quiet for 10 seconds.

1030
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,670
(Keeping 15 children quiet for 10 seconds)

1031
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,540
For 10 seconds.

1032
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:04,040
(How will they keep these children quiet for 10 seconds?)

1033
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,940
- I think 10 seconds are too long. - That's too difficult.

1034
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:11,940
Third is to put on Santa Claus gloves and take off the name tags...

1035
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,840
of 15 children within 60 seconds.

1036
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,540
That's easy.

1037
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,140
(Gosh, that's so easy.)

1038
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,040
Are you going to attack the children?

1039
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,170
They are children.

1040
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:26,170
Will you give them their worst memory?

1041
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:28,170
- These children are innocent. - You might traumatize them.

1042
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,470
It's a Christmas nightmare.

1043
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,540
We have to earn 20 points.

1044
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,700
That's right.

1045
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,040
Except for So Hyun, I'm the most childlike.

1046
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,600
- What did you say? - Come on, Kwang Soo.

1047
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,100
You should quit smoking first.

1048
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,600
(What are you talking about?)

1049
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,340
Stop going to clubs.

1050
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,770
- Why does that matter? - Goodness.

1051
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,040
Guess who's the one living like a child.

1052
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,370
- Who is it? - Who?

1053
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,670
I live like a child because I don't do anything.

1054
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,270
Then why do you look so old?

1055
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,440
When I'm off work, I go home and sleep after eating.

1056
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,900
If you don't do anything,

1057
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,300
it means you're unemployed.

1058
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,240
(Seok Jin is an unemployed old man.)

1059
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:06,070
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo must hear the following in 3 minutes.)

1060
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:08,670
(It's fun. I love you. Stay strong.)

1061
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:11,870
(Kwang Soo is good at fidgeting like a child.)

1062
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,510
Let's go in, Kwang Soo.

1063
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,970
(Will they succeed the first part of the mission?)

1064
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:18,040
Let's start by saying hello.

1065
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,140
Hello.

1066
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,700
- Hello, everyone. - Hello.

1067
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,600
(They're from Running Man.)

1068
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,040
- What's going on here? - I've seen you before.

1069
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,940
- Have you seen me? - Hello.

1070
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,100
- Do you know Running Man? - Yes!

1071
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:34,040
Running Man is about that.

1072
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,170
What? Do you know what it is?

1073
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:38,140
- I've watched all of it. - I know what it is.

1074
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,240
You have?

1075
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,570
(The children are loud and energetic.)

1076
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,700
Right, take a look.

1077
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,540
It'll be hard to make them quiet.

1078
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,470
It won't be easy for 10 seconds.

1079
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,470
They don't stop talking.

1080
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,570
- In 1, 2, 3. Start. - Start.

1081
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,370
What do you think of Running Man?

1082
00:42:52,940 --> 00:43:00,440
(He doesn't need anything else, but "It's fun.")

1083
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,540
It's strange.

1084
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:07,770
(Is it that bad?)

1085
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,540
(He's such a merciless critic.)

1086
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,800
Good job. The children are doing well.

1087
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,370
They're so cute.

1088
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:16,740
It's fun.

1089
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:18,840
Is it fun?

1090
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:21,470
(Did you just say it's fun?)

1091
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:22,640
Is Running Man fun?

1092
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,440
- No. - It's fun.

1093
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,140
What do you think of Running Man?

1094
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,070
(They succeed in hearing "It's fun.")

1095
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,770
- It's fun. - It's fun.

1096
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:31,540
- It's funny. - Everyone.

1097
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,470
Do you know what this is?

1098
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:36,140
- It's a heart, isn't it? - Tell me what you think in three.

1099
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:37,700
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1100
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:45,870
(A heart obviously means "I love you." Will you say it?)

1101
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,800
- It's fun. - It's fun.

1102
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,170
(The heart is fun too.)

1103
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:55,470
- That one is over, okay? - What's this?

1104
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,640
(Laughing)

1105
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,770
"That one is over."

1106
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,170
- That one is over, okay? - What's this?

1107
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,870
- What did you say? - Say it again.

1108
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,040
- I love you. - I love you.

1109
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,440
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1110
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,170
(They succeed in hearing "I love you.")

1111
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:09,170
Everyone.

1112
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:10,400
(They're expert on this.)

1113
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,140
- The children are so innocent. - They're very good.

1114
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,970
Look at me, okay?

1115
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:16,400
(They go for the last comment.)

1116
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,440
What do you think about me?

1117
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,170
(Hurry up and answer.)

1118
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:21,640
- What do you think about me? - You're a middle-aged man.

1119
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:23,070
- A middle-aged man? - What?

1120
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,970
- I'm only 32 years old. - What do you think?

1121
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:31,740
- What's this? - What do you think about me?

1122
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,670
Who wants to arm wrestle with me?

1123
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,270
Do you want to arm wrestle with me?

1124
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:36,770
- Do you want to play? - Who wants to play?

1125
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:37,870
In 1, 2, 3.

1126
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:39,370
- You're very strong. - In 1, 2, 3.

1127
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:41,470
(They try to make them say, "You're strong.")

1128
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,470
(Instead, Kwang Soo loses the arm wrestling match.)

1129
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:49,270
- I want to play. - Shall we?

1130
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,240
He should win instead.

1131
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,400
He must win so that they say, "You're strong."

1132
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,340
Gosh, he should make the children hang on him.

1133
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:59,740
Let's play one by one.

1134
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,470
How am I?

1135
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:02,540
(Everyone plays at the same time.)

1136
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,800
How am I?

1137
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,840
Don't take off my name tag.

1138
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,540
(We hope he keeps his name tag.)

1139
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,340
- Here's what's difficult. - They're getting more energetic.

1140
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,600
(They only have 40 seconds.)

1141
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,570
- What am I like? - How do I look?

1142
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:18,500
(He tenses up without having any muscle.)

1143
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,170
How do I look?

1144
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:21,970
(Punching)

1145
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,500
(A child hits his face.)

1146
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,870
- He got hit in the face. - Gosh.

1147
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,270
(He gets hit by a child.)

1148
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:32,300
He should make the children hang on his arm.

1149
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:33,770
(Oh, no! Only 10 seconds left.)

1150
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:35,270
Is he strong or not?

1151
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,470
- What do you think? - You're not strong.

1152
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,140
- You're strong! - How am I?

1153
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,500
(They try to make them say it.)

1154
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,270
- Be quiet. - Look at him.

1155
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:45,340
- Look. - How am I?

1156
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:51,300
(Please, children. You know what you need to say.)

1157
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,400
(There are 2 seconds left. Please say, "You're strong.")

1158
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,570
In 1, 2, 3.

1159
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,570
You're not strong.

1160
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:04,270
(You're not strong.)

1161
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:05,440
(6-year-olds are scary these days.)

1162
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,670
Mission failed.

1163
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:07,770
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo fail.)

1164
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:11,440
- Let's go. - It's not easy...

1165
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,370
- but it's doable. - They have 10 seconds?

1166
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:18,170
(Jong Kook and Haha must silence the children for 10 seconds.)

1167
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:24,570
(Would they be able to achieve silence in 10 seconds?)

1168
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,040
(They act bright.)

1169
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:33,440
It's Haha.

1170
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:37,340
- It looks dangerous. - They're very hyper right now.

1171
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,670
It's not easy.

1172
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:41,800
(Even 1 second will be a challenge.)

1173
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,140
He's dangerous.

1174
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:48,870
(He's full of energy.)

1175
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:50,040
Look at him.

1176
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:55,270
- Hello, Haha. - Thank you.

1177
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,900
- Hello. - Hello.

1178
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,140
(Hello, everybody.)

1179
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,470
Everybody.

1180
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:04,040
We're going to play a fun game.

1181
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:05,800
(Exclaiming)

1182
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,270
Clap.

1183
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:10,840
(They focus at the word "game".)

1184
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,940
- Haha is good. - It's looking good.

1185
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,540
- It's looking good. - It is.

1186
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:16,170
The children are focused on them.

1187
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,440
Do you know what game it is?

1188
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,570
- Yes. - Yes.

1189
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,070
We have to rip name tags.

1190
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,100
- We have to rip name tags. - Ripping name tags?

1191
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,540
The winner gets a chance to rip our name tags.

1192
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:30,440
If you win this game,

1193
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,940
- you can rip our name tags. - That's right.

1194
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,100
You have to win this game.

1195
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,140
(Are they in or not?)

1196
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:44,900
(He makes weird sounds.)

1197
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,900
They're not ordinary. What are we going to do with him?

1198
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:48,670
(Chuckling)

1199
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:51,340
- He's covering his ears. - Third row, right?

1200
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,470
We need to watch out for him.

1201
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,100
He's the most dangerous child for our mission.

1202
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,140
(He's full of energy.)

1203
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,870
They're not ordinary. What are we going to do with him?

1204
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:00,770
Everybody.

1205
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:05,070
If you stay silent for 10 seconds, you win the game.

1206
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:09,140
If you make noise first, you're last place.

1207
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,140
What do you do if you want to be the winner?

1208
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:14,000
- You must be quiet. - You must be quiet for 10 seconds.

1209
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:15,800
In 1, 2, 3.

1210
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,500
(Would they achieve silence for 10 seconds?)

1211
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:25,740
(They have their mouths sealed.)

1212
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,770
I think it's hard for them.

1213
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:32,040
- Aren't they so cute? - They are.

1214
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:42,340
(We're almost there, guys. Please hold on a bit more.)

1215
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:55,700
(They succeeded the mission.)

1216
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,140
(Great job, kids.)

1217
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,540
- You won. - You won.

1218
00:48:58,540 --> 00:48:59,870
You're all first place.

1219
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,840
- You're first place. - You won.

1220
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:03,840
Wasn't that it?

1221
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,400
(They did it again.)

1222
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,470
- Thank you for not talking. - You won.

1223
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:10,770
- Were you scared? - It ripped.

1224
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,540
(You can walk in here on your own but you can't leave.)

1225
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,870
You're so good at this.

1226
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,640
(A kid starts doing sit-ups.)

1227
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:20,940
What is he doing?

1228
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,340
(This is how children say farewell.)

1229
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,940
Haha is flustered.

1230
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,370
Isn't Haha struggling?

1231
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:28,570
(I want to play with you, Haha.)

1232
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:30,170
- Nobody's here. - Nobody's here, right?

1233
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:31,170
(Haha is popular amongst children.)

1234
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:32,970
What are you doing?

1235
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,000
(Lifting)

1236
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,800
Bye, Haha.

1237
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,070
- I love you. - You'll get to rip name tags soon.

1238
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:43,640
- I love you. - Bye. I love you.

1239
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,040
(Haha and Jong Kook earn 20°C.)

1240
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,070
(The last mission is to rip children's name tags in 1 minute.)

1241
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:51,700
- Hello. - Guys.

1242
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,370
Hello, guys.

1243
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:55,800
(The last duo enters confidently.)

1244
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:57,800
"Infinite Challenge".

1245
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,900
Hello!

1246
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,970
(Jae Seok is a star amongst children too.)

1247
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:04,070
- Guys. - Guys.

1248
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,740
- Guys. - Sure. What?

1249
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,870
(Crowded)

1250
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,140
Polar bears?

1251
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:11,240
They're not even going to Seok Jin.

1252
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,370
Seok Jin.

1253
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,370
Gather around Seok Jin.

1254
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:17,100
- All right. - Let's do this.

1255
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:19,170
I'm the devil.

1256
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,940
(Their plan is to play "Angel and Devil" game.)

1257
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:24,370
I'm the good person.

1258
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:26,170
I'm the angel.

1259
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:30,540
They're going to gather the children and rip their name tags.

1260
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:32,500
That's a good plan.

1261
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:36,970
If you want to be an angel, you can line up in front of me...

1262
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:41,140
and if you want to be on the devil's side, go to him.

1263
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,700
- Yes. - Yes.

1264
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,100
If you come to me, I'll slap your bottoms.

1265
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,140
(He acts mean.)

1266
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,040
(Nobody wants that.)

1267
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,570
Let's get started. Let's say, "Start."

1268
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,700
In 1, 2, 3.

1269
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,870
- Start. - Start.

1270
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:55,870
Don't run.

1271
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:58,100
Come to the angel. One by one.

1272
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,040
Hold on.

1273
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:03,470
I'm the devil. I'm going to rip your name tags.

1274
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:05,740
The devil's going to rip your name tags.

1275
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:06,940
Tae Hee.

1276
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:09,440
If you want to be on the devil's side, come here.

1277
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,070
(The kids try to fight the devil.)

1278
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,140
I'm the devil.

1279
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:14,000
Why is Seok Jin getting punched?

1280
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:15,900
I don't know.

1281
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,770
The children are united. They want to become angels.

1282
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:20,370
The devil can rip the name tags, too.

1283
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:22,140
Why am I getting absorbed in this?

1284
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:24,770
- Hurry up. - Seo Hyun is next.

1285
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:27,000
You should rip them too, Seok Jin.

1286
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,540
- Seo Hyun. - The devil's going to rip it.

1287
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:32,940
I'm the devil. You're on my side.

1288
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:34,340
Hold on.

1289
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,740
Help him, Seok Jin.

1290
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,970
He needs to help.

1291
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:38,840
- He's supposed to help. - My gosh.

1292
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:41,040
They have no time so Seok Jin has to help.

1293
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,570
He should rip them too.

1294
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,470
Stop, Seung Soo.

1295
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,170
- Hold on. - Hey.

1296
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,040
- Seung Soo. - What are you doing?

1297
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,040
It's not coming off.

1298
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,500
I'm going to rip it.

1299
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,900
This won't work.

1300
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,840
- I'll help. - Hold on.

1301
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:59,800
- I guess there's no time. - Seriously.

1302
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:01,800
Why weren't you helping?

1303
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,370
There's not enough time.

1304
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:06,440
- You were supposed to help. - I see.

1305
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,170
He's a fool.

1306
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:11,100
- He thought he was a real devil. - I agree.

1307
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,240
- He was absorbed in it. - He's red like the devil.

1308
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,040
He thought he was Red Devil.

1309
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,000
He thought he was Red Devil.

1310
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:23,770
(The kids are punishing the devil.)

1311
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:26,270
(They're eradicating the devil.)

1312
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:27,540
I love you, guys.

1313
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,570
- Thank you... - I should have helped.

1314
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:33,400
for joining us on Running Man.

1315
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,440
- Yes. - Always listen to your teacher.

1316
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,240
I hope you grow up healthy and bright.

1317
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,940
- Thank you. - Yes.

1318
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,170
- Bye. - Bye.

1319
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:46,500
(Thank you for reminding us of our inner child.)

1320
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,670
(There's a surprise for the children.)

1321
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:54,100
(The staff delivered gifts for each child.)

1322
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:59,770
(Merry Christmas!)

1323
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,040
(Christmas with little angels)

1324
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:08,540
(They've accumulated 50°C.)

1325
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:10,240
I was so absorbed into being a devil.

1326
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,800
- Why didn't you rip the name tags? - I know.

1327
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,870
- I was so absorbed in my role. - Why didn't you help?

1328
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:18,770
What was that?

1329
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,570
(Hitting)

1330
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,840
It's still a mystery to me.

1331
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,070
(Come on.)

1332
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:26,240
Why didn't I help?

1333
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,770
- What are you doing? - It's getting started again.

1334
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,340
It's getting started.

1335
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,700
(You never know when they'll start attacking each other.)

1336
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,000
Jong Kook is...

1337
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,370
(Jae Seok finds a new target.)

1338
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:37,500
(My gosh!)

1339
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,800
- What are you doing? - That's Jae Seok's mission.

1340
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,440
He has to spray water on someone's face.

1341
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,270
- Is it me? - He has to spray water.

1342
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:44,400
There's something to this.

1343
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,840
I know you're not my Bad Santa.

1344
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,400
What are you doing?

1345
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,000
(Here I come.)

1346
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,170
(Kicking)

1347
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:52,770
Did you really kick me?

1348
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:54,970
Wasn't that a low kick? That actually hurt.

1349
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:56,840
- It wasn't. - It really hurt.

1350
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,940
(Why is he pinching?)

1351
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,700
(You idiot)

1352
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,340
- He's kicking him for real. - That looks painful.

1353
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:10,040
(They go back and forth.)

1354
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,440
What should we do?

1355
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,100
(We're close.)

1356
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:16,140
(Jae Seok joins in as well.)

1357
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,970
(They kick as hard as they love each other.)

1358
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,700
(Collapsing)

1359
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:26,270
(Bad Santas work hard even during break.)

1360
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:27,340
That's so funny.

1361
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,600
It's funny.

1362
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:32,570
The second mission has ended.

1363
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,370
It's time for "Bully's Confession" again.

1364
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:36,900
- Let's do it again. - Let's do it.

1365
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,170
- All right. - Okay.

1366
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,040
(How many bullies did each member complete?)

1367
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:42,600
My list...

1368
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:45,240
hasn't changed. It's still the same.

1369
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:46,800
When we went to the kindergarten,

1370
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,470
I stepped on the person's foot as soon as I sat down.

1371
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:51,840
(Jong Kook's list of pranks)

1372
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,300
When we got back, I tripped the person.

1373
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,770
I did two more.

1374
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,040
(Haha's list of pranks)

1375
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,340
(I can't do it.)

1376
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,670
(I couldn't do any.)

1377
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,400
I did five.

1378
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,440
Did you clear them all?

1379
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,570
(Jae Seok's list of pranks)

1380
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:13,770
I just hope it's not Jong Kook.

1381
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:15,770
(Jae Seok is Ji Hyo's Bad Santa.)

1382
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:16,970
What now?

1383
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:19,070
How can I bully Ji Hyo?

1384
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:21,240
("Bullying mission")

1385
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,240
(He stepped on Ji Hyo, poked her cheeks, and put dirt on her face.)

1386
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,800
(He also sprayed water on her face and took her shoe off.)

1387
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,600
I'm done.

1388
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:35,440
(Kwang Soo is Jae Seok's Bad Santa.)

1389
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,870
I'm in trouble.

1390
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,870
("Bullying mission")

1391
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:42,070
(Kwang Soo untied Jae Seok's shoelaces, stepped on his foot,)

1392
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:44,540
(pinched his thigh, got water on him, and hit his Adam's apple.)

1393
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:48,140
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo cleared their mission.)

1394
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:53,900
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo succeed and Haha comes in last.)

1395
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:58,270
When will we ever get a chance to pull pranks like this?

1396
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:00,500
Today is like Jae Seok's birthday.

1397
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:01,970
- That's true. - There's no time.

1398
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:03,800
- Did Jong Kook finish? - Look at Jong Kook's.

1399
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,570
- Is he Ji Hyo's Bad Santa? - I think he's my Bad Santa.

1400
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:08,840
- He kicked me, didn't he? - He did.

1401
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,640
Jong Kook bullied a lot when we came back here.

1402
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:12,700
He seemed so determined.

1403
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,500
- He bullied me a lot just now. - He kicked me once.

1404
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,500
Now, it's time for you...

1405
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,400
- She's really good. - to guess who your Santa is.

1406
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,340
It's not easy to interrupt like that.

1407
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,640
You'll play "Guess Your Santa" again.

1408
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,870
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's do that.

1409
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:30,040
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1410
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,140
(They play to be fair.)

1411
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,500
- Okay. - Okay.

1412
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,140
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo win.)

1413
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,440
- Rock-paper-scissors. - It's one of them.

1414
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,340
- Come in with me. - Me?

1415
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,170
I said to come in right now.

1416
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:43,340
Wait.

1417
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:44,900
- Go in. - I'm not it.

1418
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:45,940
- Go in. - Go in.

1419
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:48,400
- Let's go in. - I'm not the one.

1420
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,400
We have a lot to do.

1421
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,770
If I'm wrong, you can spank me five times.

1422
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:53,440
- Just come in. - Kwang Soo.

1423
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,670
Just come in. We'll find out.

1424
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,340
- Let's go in. - I'm not your Santa.

1425
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,170
You'll be spanked again.

1426
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:03,740
- I'm sure about it this time. - You'll be spanked again.

1427
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:07,340
I'm sorry, but if it's not Jae Seok, it has to be Seok Jin.

1428
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:11,940
Kwang Soo's Bad Santa is...

1429
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:14,340
(If he's right, Seok Jin's donation is made under Kwang Soo's name.)

1430
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,640
(Did Kwang Soo guess correctly?)

1431
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,670
Is it Seok Jin?

1432
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:18,400
- I don't think it's Seok Jin. - I think Seok Jin...

1433
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,240
is Kwang Soo's Bad Santa.

1434
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,300
All right.

1435
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,770
- Bell of truth, please ring. - Please ring.

1436
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:27,640
- What's the result? - Please, please.

1437
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:29,000
Rudolph.

1438
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:32,440
Rudolph.

1439
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,270
(Let me introduce my Rudolph.)

1440
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:36,900
(Kwang Soo guesses correctly.)

1441
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,040
Shouldn't Rudolph be on all fours?

1442
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,500
Shouldn't Rudolph be on all fours?

1443
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:43,870
Didn't Seok Jin make it too obvious?

1444
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,400
- My goodness. - You should be on all fours.

1445
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,970
Finally, I have my own Rudolph.

1446
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:51,670
You have a big nose just like your nickname.

1447
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:54,400
- That's true. - I thought it was your real nose.

1448
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,240
"Guess Your Santa" is over.

1449
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:59,170
Please choose another box for the next mission.

1450
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:01,440
Someone else should choose one this time.

1451
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,670
- Let's pick a big one. - Can my Rudolph pick one?

1452
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:05,540
- Yes, I'll pick one. - My Rudolph will do it.

1453
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,140
- Okay. - He's good at picking.

1454
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:09,170
How about a small one?

1455
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,170
- That's not a box. - It isn't?

1456
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:12,570
How about this one?

1457
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:15,570
I was supposed to pick one.

1458
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:18,170
- It's okay. - You said I should pick one.

1459
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:21,340
You should pick one fast, but you couldn't find the boxes.

1460
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,800
(What's their next mission?)

1461
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,140
- It's inside. - It's "Guess the Result".

1462
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,100
What's that?

1463
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:30,300
The third round is "Guess the Result".

1464
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,340
You must predict whether the member will clear the mission...

1465
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:36,000
or fail.

1466
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:39,100
If you're correct, you'll earn the number of degrees...

1467
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,270
- that you bet. - Do we play this as a group?

1468
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:43,070
If you're incorrect, one of you will be punished.

1469
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:45,140
- Just one person? - The category is music.

1470
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,940
Please choose two members who will compete.

1471
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,670
- Music? - I don't feel confident.

1472
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:50,100
Shouldn't singers do it?

1473
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,670
Let's have Jong Kook and Ji Hyo play.

1474
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,170
- Give it a try, Ji Hyo. - Okay.

1475
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:55,500
- You must bet on... - Bet 30°C.

1476
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,800
- who will clear the mission. - It should be 30°C.

1477
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,440
- 30°C - Let's bet 30°C.

1478
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,840
Let's bet 30°C.

1479
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,000
(They bet 30°C.)

1480
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,340
- Is it difficult? - It's guessing the song title.

1481
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,540
When the music plays, put on the headphones.

1482
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:10,440
Guess the title of the song that I'll sing.

1483
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:13,000
- Are you going to sing? - Yes.

1484
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:14,400
Are you good at singing?

1485
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:16,840
- You won't hear me sing anyway. - Right, right.

1486
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,040
She's wondering why you want to know.

1487
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,800
It doesn't matter whether she sings well or not.

1488
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,770
- You can't hear her anyway. - I can sense the feeling.

1489
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:27,170
- She's very witty. - Don't miss her singing.

1490
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:28,540
So Hyun is quite witty.

1491
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:30,170
I'm sad that I won't hear her sing.

1492
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:32,000
You're witty, So Hyun.

1493
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,640
Please play the music.

1494
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,370
It depends on what the song is.

1495
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,370
- Jong Kook is better at music. - Let's bet on Jong Kook.

1496
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:41,070
Let's bet on Jong Kook.

1497
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,100
In 2, 3.

1498
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:46,300
(Is it Jong Kook or Ji Hyo?)

1499
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:48,100
- In 2, 3. - Jong Kook.

1500
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,140
(They bet on Jong Kook's success.)

1501
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:50,170
Get ready.

1502
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:53,300
You don't know whom we chose, so you must do your best.

1503
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:54,740
That's right.

1504
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,840
Do your best.

1505
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,040
- What did you say? - Good luck.

1506
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:01,370
- Do your best. - Of course, I will.

1507
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:02,470
Get ready.

1508
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:04,840
Start.

1509
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:07,270
(Jong Kook must guess 2 out of 3 first for the bet to succeed.)

1510
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,070
(Will they win their bet?)

1511
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:11,770
Get ready, start.

1512
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,440
("Wrong Meeting" by Kim Gun Mo)

1513
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,040
After we had a big argument

1514
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,600
She's singing with the wrong melody.

1515
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:22,600
This isn't the right one.

1516
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:23,800
Without any contact

1517
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,940
"Any contact"?

1518
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:27,570
I finally realized

1519
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:29,340
The melody sounds strange.

1520
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,270
Just say you can't sing it.

1521
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,970
- One day - Gosh.

1522
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:35,940
(It's difficult to guess.)

1523
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:38,470
- "You and I"? - "Who's Your Mama" by JYP?

1524
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:40,300
(Wrong)

1525
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:41,570
After a big argument

1526
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:42,740
"At home"?

1527
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:46,100
- "You and I"? - After a big argument

1528
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,870
"We could fight"?

1529
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,940
"You and I"?

1530
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:52,040
(So Hyun continues to try.)

1531
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,240
"You and I are friends".

1532
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:57,270
That's not it.

1533
01:00:57,270 --> 01:01:00,070
- Guess the song title. - "You and I are friends".

1534
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:02,540
- That's not a song title. - "You and I"?

1535
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:05,570
- "After a big argument"? - You look so out of it today.

1536
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,340
(She looks out of it.)

1537
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,440
You and my friend

1538
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,100
- Stopped contacting me - "Stopped contacting me".

1539
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,240
- What's next? - You seem

1540
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,140
To avoid me

1541
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,770
- They should know by now. - You seem to avoid me

1542
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:17,470
"You and my friend stopped contacting me".

1543
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:19,940
- Which song is it? - What are the lyrics saying?

1544
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:23,800
Gosh, what are you trying to do?

1545
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:26,370
"You and my friend stopped contacting me".

1546
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,040
Someone is cheating on someone.

1547
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:32,440
- What are you doing? - That's not what the song is about.

1548
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:35,040
Yes, it's about cheating.

1549
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,170
You can't contact them.

1550
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:37,800
Is it "Wrong Meeting" by Kim Gun Mo?

1551
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,570
That's right.

1552
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:40,700
That's correct.

1553
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:42,300
Is that correct?

1554
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,400
What's the answer?

1555
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:44,740
We did it.

1556
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,440
It was "Wrong Meeting" by Kim Gun Mo.

1557
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:48,000
(Answer one more, Jong Kook.)

1558
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,270
Good job.

1559
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:51,000
Jong Kook wins one point.

1560
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,170
("Eyes, Nose, Lips" by Tae Yang)

1561
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:55,970
This is Jae Seok's favorite song.

1562
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,840
(He copies Tae Yang.)

1563
01:01:57,970 --> 01:01:59,240
- "Love"? - Every

1564
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,370
- "Love"? - Fingernail

1565
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:01,500
(Which song is this?)

1566
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,040
(He also copies Tae Yang.)

1567
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:07,040
I can still feel you

1568
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,170
(Neither of them can guess which song it is.)

1569
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:11,770
This is a difficult song.

1570
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:12,970
I know.

1571
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:15,770
(If Jong Kook answers correctly, they win the bet.)

1572
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:16,940
Sing it again.

1573
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:18,570
"Only Look At Me" by Tae Yang?

1574
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:20,170
No.

1575
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:22,270
Is it "Eyes, Nose, Lips" by Tae Yang?

1576
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:24,170
- That's correct. - Is that correct?

1577
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:25,800
- That's amazing. - How did he guess it?

1578
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,470
- That was amazing. - What is it?

1579
01:02:27,470 --> 01:02:29,600
- It's "Eyes, Nose, Lips". - Just watch this on TV.

1580
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:31,000
Just watch this on TV.

1581
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Is the game over?

1582
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,170
- Is the game over? - You helped us, Ji Hyo.

1583
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:35,800
It's a good thing that you didn't guess correctly.

1584
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,770
- We bet on Jong Kook. - Did you?

1585
01:02:37,770 --> 01:02:39,000
- Yes. - Didn't I do a good job?

1586
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,170
- Yes, you did well. - Now,

1587
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:44,170
the thermometer reads 80°C.

1588
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:46,670
- We're almost there. - We have 20°C left.

1589
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,870
We only have 20°C left.

1590
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:51,570
The second category for "Guess the Result" is...

1591
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:53,540
"Rudolph's Horns".

1592
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:54,600
What's that?

1593
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,040
Please choose one member who will play with me.

1594
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,800
"Rudolph's Horns"?

1595
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,640
- Would Rudolph like to try it? - Okay.

1596
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,900
Seok Jin will give it a try.

1597
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,270
(He's the best member to play it.)

1598
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:05,340
What kind of game is it?

1599
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:09,140
Predict if a member can hook at least 3 out of 10 rings...

1600
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:12,270
on Rudolph's horns by throwing them.

1601
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:13,570
By throwing them?

1602
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:16,470
Do we bet whether they will succeed or not?

1603
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:17,640
He has to put on the horns.

1604
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,140
Is that the end if we succeed?

1605
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:20,300
Is that it?

1606
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,300
- Yes. - That's it.

1607
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,300
I have to guess my Santa before it ends.

1608
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:25,540
I have to guess my Santa before it ends.

1609
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:30,840
(Let's earn 20°C so that the others can be punished.)

1610
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:36,470
(When the temperature reaches 100°C, the 3 are punished.)

1611
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:38,940
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo are exempted from the punishment.)

1612
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:40,900
(Jong Kook won't let it happen.)

1613
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,170
Let's bet 10°C for now.

1614
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:44,000
- Let's bet 10°C. - Yes.

1615
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,700
I say we bet 20°C.

1616
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:48,700
- Why should we bet only 10°C? - What do we have to do to win?

1617
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,240
Be quiet. I'll explain to you later.

1618
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:54,370
Let's bet 20°C.

1619
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,340
That's good.

1620
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,870
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's do that.

1621
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:59,240
- All right. - Let's play.

1622
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:01,500
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1623
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:02,970
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1624
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,900
- The three of you stay. - Goodness.

1625
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:07,470
- Please, Jae Seok. - Come on, Jae Seok.

1626
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:08,470
- We have to get 20°C. - I can do it.

1627
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:10,000
- You can do it. - You can do it.

1628
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:12,140
Rock-paper-scissors.

1629
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,470
(How will their fates turn out?)

1630
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:15,040
Rock-paper-scissors.

1631
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,900
(How will their fates turn out?)

1632
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,700
Rock-paper-scissors.

1633
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:21,470
(Jong Kook wins.)

1634
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:22,870
- Bet 10°C. - 10°C.

1635
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:25,000
There we go.

1636
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,240
- Why did you lose? - 10°C.

1637
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:29,500
It's possible to hook three rings.

1638
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,740
- This is difficult. - Really?

1639
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,140
I've done it in elementary school.

1640
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:34,600
- I don't think it's possible. - 3 out of 10...

1641
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,770
I'll do my best.

1642
01:04:36,770 --> 01:04:40,170
In 1, 2, 3.

1643
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:42,840
(They bet on Seok Jin's success.)

1644
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,000
(Show us what you can do.)

1645
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,240
- Get ready. - This isn't easy.

1646
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,940
- So Hyun, you can do it. - You can do it.

1647
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,900
- That's right. - Start.

1648
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,370
Let's go, So Hyun.

1649
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:57,940
(The result depends on So Hyun and Seok Jin's teamwork.)

1650
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,300
- Gosh. - She failed.

1651
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:01,800
(She misses the first ring.)

1652
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:05,270
She still has nine left.

1653
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:07,270
You need to catch it.

1654
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:10,000
- You need to catch it. - Did she make it?

1655
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,000
You succeed if you make two more.

1656
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,400
It may be possible.

1657
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,100
It may be possible.

1658
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:19,170
(She hooks the second ring.)

1659
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:20,570
- I did it. - Did we win?

1660
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:21,640
Not yet.

1661
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:25,670
(If she hooks one more, they can earn 10°C.)

1662
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,040
Wait.

1663
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,170
(She becomes more confident.)

1664
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:38,870
(Please put it on your horn, Rudolph.)

1665
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:46,640
(She hooks the third ring.)

1666
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,170
- Was that a success? - I did it.

1667
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:50,300
(This is a Christmas miracle.)

1668
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:52,000
- What happened? - We did it.

1669
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:54,470
- We won! - Mission accomplished.

1670
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:56,940
(The second "Guess the Result" mission is a success.)

1671
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,270
So Hyun was so good.

1672
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:00,300
(It was a perfect collaboration between So Hyun and Seok Jin.)

1673
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:01,370
Seok Jin.

1674
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:03,140
I did good.

1675
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:05,000
How did you manage, So Hyun?

1676
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,440
It's nothing but I'm happy.

1677
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:07,670
(They earn 10°C and accumulate 90°C.)

1678
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:10,170
- This is amazing. - Right?

1679
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:11,370
(They're almost at 100°C.)

1680
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:14,840
The third game is called "Telepathy".

1681
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,940
- "Telepathy". - Pick one person...

1682
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:19,370
and they can write down one answer...

1683
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:21,070
to my question.

1684
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,070
The rest of the members can discuss...

1685
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:26,800
and guess 3 out of 5 to succeed.

1686
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,600
We have to pick a person who thinks normally.

1687
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,170
Don't pick somebody who has unique views.

1688
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:31,440
- We need somebody normal. - Pick somebody with common views.

1689
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,700
- It's me. - I think I'm the most...

1690
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:35,370
normal here.

1691
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:37,300
- Then you should go. - Sure. Let's pick Haha.

1692
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:39,700
Write down something we would know.

1693
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:40,800
I'll write down something very simple.

1694
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,700
Don't write down your thoughts. Make it simple.

1695
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:43,800
We can do it.

1696
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,440
We can catch one Rudolph.

1697
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:46,900
- We have to hear the question. - Haha is not ordinary.

1698
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,600
Here's the first question.

1699
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,400
(What is the first question?)

1700
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:55,170
When do you think you look the most handsome?

1701
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:58,370
(When do you think you look the most handsome?)

1702
01:06:58,370 --> 01:07:00,640
- This is... - We talked about this.

1703
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:01,700
We talked about this?

1704
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:03,070
(When do I look the most handsome?)

1705
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:04,640
When is it, Haha?

1706
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,640
- The most handsome. - When you think you look the best.

1707
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,700
- Okay. - That's normal.

1708
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,570
- Make it normal. - Let's make it normal.

1709
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,370
(When he takes a shower?)

1710
01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:14,470
- Okay, this is it. - Okay.

1711
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,540
(They pick shower.)

1712
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:18,800
One.

1713
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:20,700
- After taking a shower. - After taking a shower.

1714
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,470
(Did we get it, Haha?)

1715
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,800
- After taking a shower. - After taking a shower.

1716
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,670
(They matched.)

1717
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:31,570
(Guys look the best after taking a shower.)

1718
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:33,040
- Right? - That's when you look sexy.

1719
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:34,940
(Let's keep this going.)

1720
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:36,700
- This is how it goes. - Good job.

1721
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:39,700
Here's the second question. How do you relieve stress?

1722
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,340
- Isn't this it? - This is difficult.

1723
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,700
(Doesn't Haha like basketball?)

1724
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,640
- This is too general. - This is difficult.

1725
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:50,540
Hold on. I have to get this right.

1726
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:52,570
Can I just pick one answer and you try to guess it?

1727
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:54,170
- Sure, let's do that. - That sounds right.

1728
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,700
- Haha, pick whatever you like. - Pick whatever you like.

1729
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:57,800
Don't try to guess what we're going to say.

1730
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:59,600
Should we do this?

1731
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,540
(That's the Haha I know.)

1732
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:04,240
- It's this. - Stop doing that.

1733
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:06,170
- Stop it. - That's it.

1734
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:07,600
You know me, right?

1735
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,300
- Yes. - That's the only way.

1736
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,100
- See? This is it. - What about this?

1737
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,100
(Is it alcohol or basketball?)

1738
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,700
No, that's not it.

1739
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:15,500
- It's this. - It's this.

1740
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,310
- In 1, 2, 3. - It's this.

1741
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:19,170
- In 1, 2, 3. Alcohol. - Alcohol.

1742
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:22,640
(Haha, do you relieve stress by drinking?)

1743
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:24,900
- In 1, 2, 3. Alcohol. - Alcohol.

1744
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,770
(They matched.)

1745
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:28,100
(Talking with good people while drinking)

1746
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,570
(It worked. They're happy.)

1747
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:32,810
That's what Haha does.

1748
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:33,900
(They've been together for 7 years.)

1749
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:35,370
- I like to talk. - We know a lot.

1750
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,400
- We know a lot about you. - I wrote it down right away.

1751
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,740
- This is it. - It's alcohol.

1752
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:39,740
It's the last question.

1753
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,070
That was a bit difficult.

1754
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:43,900
- Think about me. I'm the standard. - Right.

1755
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:45,310
Here's the third question.

1756
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,740
Which celebrity do you want to switch looks with?

1757
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:49,270
He talks about this person all the time.

1758
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:50,900
There's one.

1759
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,470
(It's G-Dragon.)

1760
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:54,810
(They've heard Haha mention his name way too many times.)

1761
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:56,810
It changed recently.

1762
01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:57,810
(I have a new idol now.)

1763
01:08:57,810 --> 01:08:59,100
He has a new one now.

1764
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:01,270
Just write the one you always mention.

1765
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:04,310
I think it hurts his pride to say it.

1766
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,170
(It's a dilemma.)

1767
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:09,400
This is a really difficult question but I think I know the answer.

1768
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:11,900
- Sure, it's simple. - Sure.

1769
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:14,810
You always say this on Running Man.

1770
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:16,310
Write down what you think.

1771
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:18,500
(Whom did Haha pick?)

1772
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:22,440
Haha has a few in mind.

1773
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:24,500
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1774
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:25,540
- G-Dragon. - G-Dragon.

1775
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:29,100
(If they get this right, they'll achieve 100°C.)

1776
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,070
(Did they get it right?)

1777
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:33,640
(G-Dragon)

1778
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:34,770
(They matched.)

1779
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:36,270
- G-Dragon. - G-Dragon.

1780
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:39,700
(They get three questions in a row. They achieve 100°C.)

1781
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:42,000
He liked G-Dragon for a long time.

1782
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,400
Let's do five questions.

1783
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,070
- Shall we continue? - I'm so happy now.

1784
01:09:47,070 --> 01:09:49,400
- You have already... - I'm getting goosebumps.

1785
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,470
- Haha. - We matched.

1786
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:52,700
What was that?

1787
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:54,440
- I love you. - He likes G-Dragon.

1788
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,640
You have already cleared the mission.

1789
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,100
- We cleared it. - Let's go for five questions.

1790
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:59,100
(This is a special round.)

1791
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,570
They know so much about me.

1792
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:02,140
Here's the fourth question.

1793
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:04,900
What do you think is your best body part?

1794
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:08,240
- How am I supposed to write this? - His right arm.

1795
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:10,170
(He used to show off his muscular right arm.)

1796
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:12,170
- How am I supposed to write this? - He always flashes it at us.

1797
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,600
He always flashes it at us.

1798
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:16,000
(Haha, you know your right bicep looks good, right?)

1799
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,870
- In 1, 2, 3. - Right arm.

1800
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:21,000
(Will they get four in a row?)

1801
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,170
(Right arm)

1802
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:23,370
(They matched.)

1803
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:26,140
Is this a prank? Is it?

1804
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:28,640
I'm getting goosebumps.

1805
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:30,310
(It's 100 percent real.)

1806
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:31,740
What was that?

1807
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,470
Is this a prank?

1808
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:35,670
(They're united over the right answer.)

1809
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:39,570
I can't believe it.

1810
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,100
Shall we try one more? How did we get it right?

1811
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:45,070
- This is unbelievable. - We didn't get any wrong.

1812
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:47,270
- Here's the last question. - We got 100 percent right.

1813
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:49,170
- This is a bit difficult. - I'm touched.

1814
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:51,170
When do you feel like an adult?

1815
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,870
I know.

1816
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:57,700
- It's that time. - When Dream was born.

1817
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:59,170
(Is it when Haha became a dad?)

1818
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:01,940
- That's right. - Please. This is the last one.

1819
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:05,000
(We can read each other's minds.)

1820
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,500
(Would they get 5 in a row and make the impossible possible?)

1821
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,000
Please. This is the last one.

1822
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,500
(Dream)

1823
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,740
- When Dream was born. - When Dream was born.

1824
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:13,470
(It's correct.)

1825
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:15,900
(They get 5 in a row.)

1826
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:18,670
(You don't have to say it.)

1827
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:20,340
It's Dream.

1828
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:23,270
- This is amazing. - It's obvious.

1829
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:25,540
- I'm about to cry. - We can guess 200 questions right.

1830
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,100
I guessed it first.

1831
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,540
- What just happened? - I'm about to cry.

1832
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:31,870
- This is a miracle. - It is.

1833
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:34,440
- I told you. - We spent a long time together.

1834
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:38,000
(It's a miracle created by the 7 years they've been together.)

1835
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,900
- I'm touched. - Me too.

1836
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,700
Nobody would guess his right arm.

1837
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:43,400
Nobody would.

1838
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,470
The thermometer's full.

1839
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:46,540
- Okay. We did it. - Yes!

1840
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:47,700
(They achieve 100°C.)

1841
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:50,770
You have achieved 100°C. Here's the final "Bully's Confession".

1842
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:53,100
(If they don't want to be punished,)

1843
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,100
(they must complete their lists.)

1844
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,600
(Haha only completed 1.)

1845
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:02,270
If Seok Jin has him, he can't attack, right?

1846
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:04,170
I can't. I am done.

1847
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:05,170
(Glancing)

1848
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,600
(Haha does something to Jong Kook.)

1849
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:09,970
He's going to kill you.

1850
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:12,040
This wasn't the right timing. I can't help you.

1851
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:14,170
(Did you just touch a tiger's cheek?)

1852
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:16,000
I have no time.

1853
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:18,100
Just do it quickly.

1854
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,170
I think he has him.

1855
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,170
(Haha sprays water on him.)

1856
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:24,170
(I have no mercy.)

1857
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:26,540
(Jong Kook pays back to Jae Seok instead of Haha.)

1858
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:28,100
Why are you twisting my arm?

1859
01:12:28,570 --> 01:12:30,810
All Santas, except for the Rudolph,

1860
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:33,140
open the window and say your last confessions.

1861
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:36,100
(Jong Kook has 4, Ji Hyo has 2, and Haha has 1 so far.)

1862
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:42,370
When he was drinking water, I hit his hand and spilled it.

1863
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:45,170
(Jong Kook had 4 before so does that make it 5?)

1864
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:48,740
(5 hours ago, while picking his opponent)

1865
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:50,810
(Who is Jong Kook's prey?)

1866
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:51,900
(Congratulations, Haha.)

1867
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:52,900
He's my younger brother.

1868
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:53,940
(But I still need to do it.)

1869
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:55,100
I'm reluctant.

1870
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:57,810
("Bullying mission")

1871
01:12:57,810 --> 01:13:00,840
(Jong Kook stepped on Haha, tripped him, put something...)

1872
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,700
(in his shirt, spilled his water, and hit him.)

1873
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,500
Mission cleared.

1874
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:05,500
(Jong Kook clears the mission.)

1875
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,940
(Ji Hyo's target was Seok Jin.)

1876
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:09,400
I didn't get anything.

1877
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,770
(She only took off his glasses and knocked his knees.)

1878
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:16,940
I untied his shoelaces, dabbed his cheek, and sprayed water on him.

1879
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:19,070
(Haha was being a coward and only got 3 done.)

1880
01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:20,500
(He couldn't splash coke on him or hide his shoes.)

1881
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:23,100
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo cleared the missions.)

1882
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:26,310
(Jong Kook also cleared his.)

1883
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:28,810
We're all done.

1884
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:32,070
The three members who didn't clear the mission will be punished.

1885
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:34,670
We'll penalize just one person.

1886
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:37,810
- That's good. - Whoever gets picked...

1887
01:13:37,810 --> 01:13:39,810
- Let's do a lottery. - Let's do that.

1888
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:41,270
I have a feeling it'll be me.

1889
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:42,270
(The lottery starts.)

1890
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:43,370
Please hand them out, So Hyun.

1891
01:13:43,870 --> 01:13:47,100
(Only 1 out of 3 cards is the penalty card.)

1892
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,100
(The unlucky Kwang Soo is interested in this.)

1893
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:49,700
Let's see how you react.

1894
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,270
In 1, 2, 3.

1895
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:54,600
(Which member is the unlucky one on Christmas?)

1896
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
(Ji Hyo has the penalty card.)

1897
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,370
(Oh dear, Ji Hyo.)

1898
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:03,370
Would you like to switch?

1899
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:05,170
Why is it "Oh dear"?

1900
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:06,270
(Should we switch or not?)

1901
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,170
Life is not that complicated.

1902
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:09,170
Okay.

1903
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:12,400
(Seok Jin and Ji Hyo switch.)

1904
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,640
(Seok Jin has the penalty card now.)

1905
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,170
(Would you like to switch?)

1906
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:18,310
No, no.

1907
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,600
(I refuse.)

1908
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:22,570
(I don't have a good feeling about that one.)

1909
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:23,600
I don't want it.

1910
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:26,140
I think he has a bad feeling.

1911
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:29,000
(It's time to check the cards.)

1912
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,270
- In 3, 2, 1. - In 3, 2, 1.

1913
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:32,370
Open it up.

1914
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,170
(Seok Jin has the penalty card.)

1915
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:37,570
I'll never switch with you.

1916
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:40,570
Over my dead body.

1917
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:41,570
(Seok Jin has the worst luck.)

1918
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:43,000
Don't ask for it.

1919
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:45,270
(I'm exempt.)

1920
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:49,170
- Was it me before? - It was you.

1921
01:14:49,170 --> 01:14:51,000
(Seok Jin and Ji Hyo's fates have changed.)

1922
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,100
- All right. - I told you to switch.

1923
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:54,810
What? What did I do?

1924
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:55,940
Haha just looked at his.

1925
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:56,940
(You shouldn't switch without thinking.)

1926
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,840
The ultimate penalty goes to...

1927
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,310
Rudolph Seok Jin.

1928
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:03,270
(Rudolph Seok Jin will get the last penalty.)

1929
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:05,170
- Go in. - This is driving me nuts.

1930
01:15:05,170 --> 01:15:06,740
There goes Jong Kook.

1931
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:09,100
I'll escort him. Here he goes.

1932
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:11,810
Get set, go. Put your head in.

1933
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:14,140
- This is too funny. - My goodness.

1934
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:17,100
(What kind of Christmas nightmare is in the box?)

1935
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:18,870
- You're almost done. - It must be something intense.

1936
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:21,310
I think it's hurting him.

1937
01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:23,570
(My goodness)

1938
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:24,700
(What is wrong with his face?)

1939
01:15:25,370 --> 01:15:26,370
I'm relieved.

1940
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:32,540
(It's clothes pegs, ink, and flour all at once.)

1941
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:36,070
(Welcome to the Christmas horror show.)

1942
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:38,540
- That's horrible. - I'm so relieved.

1943
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:39,700
(Jae Seok, Jong Kook, and Kwang Soo get to donate under their names.)

1944
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:43,700
Anyhow, Merry Christmas, everybody.

1945
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:44,700
Viewers,

1946
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:48,270
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

1947
01:15:48,270 --> 01:15:50,310
(Merry Christmas)

1948
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,100
(On Christmas morning)

1949
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:55,440
- Hello. - Why is it so dark in here?

1950
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,870
- Hello. - Hi.

1951
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:58,700
I never thought I would see you all again.

1952
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,310
- And yet, we are here again. - Yes, we are.

1953
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,810
What is this?

1954
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:03,040
(What is it?)

1955
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,310
- They are apples. - Lift the whole box?

1956
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:06,840
- Apples? - They are apples.

1957
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:08,070
(It's a basket of apples with a Christmas card.)

1958
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:09,970
- Should I read this? - Yes, please.

1959
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:12,100
"Dear beloved members of Running Man,"

1960
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:16,170
"we apologize for hurting your feelings in this past week."

1961
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:19,100
"We will endeavor to be mature and to do our best."

1962
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:22,470
"Once again, we are sorry. We love you. From the Running Man staff."

1963
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:25,870
In the upcoming year,

1964
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:28,600
- we will do our best. - Yes, we will.

1965
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:34,310
Once again, we would like to apologize for worrying you.

1966
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,670
Everyone, Merry Christmas.

1967
01:16:36,670 --> 01:16:39,270
(Have a happy Christmas.)

1968
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:42,370
(Next week)

1969
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:45,540
(2017 Kickoff will be held.)

1970
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:48,470
(Running Man will have a big project in 2017.)

1971
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:51,440
(Their grand project will be revealed.)

1972
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,170
(2017 Kickoff)
