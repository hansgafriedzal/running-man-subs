1
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:10,794
(The third participant is...)

2
00:00:10,794 --> 00:00:13,294
(Jee Seok Jin.)

3
00:00:13,394 --> 00:00:15,664
My time has finally come.

4
00:00:15,664 --> 00:00:17,634
I'm going crazy because I have so many things I want to do.

5
00:00:17,634 --> 00:00:19,764
I want to put all of them in prison...

6
00:00:19,764 --> 00:00:21,924
and be the king in there.

7
00:00:21,924 --> 00:00:21,934
I want to have an event for my loving wife.
and be the king in there.

8
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:26,084
I want to have an event for my loving wife.

9
00:00:26,084 --> 00:00:28,624
I'd like to challenge myself to something I couldn't do before.

10
00:00:28,954 --> 00:00:31,984
Please do one of these three. I won't complain.

11
00:00:32,924 --> 00:00:37,354
(Forget the past Seok Jin. It is a revenge he waited for 7 years.)

12
00:00:38,754 --> 00:00:40,384
(If I'm unhappy, it'll be solitary confinement.)

13
00:00:40,724 --> 00:00:44,784
(Abusing his authority will bring a terrible result.)

14
00:00:44,784 --> 00:00:48,224
(He's had it for the past 7 years. He will get his revenge.)

15
00:00:48,224 --> 00:00:50,954
(His counterattack is about to unfold.)

16
00:00:51,824 --> 00:00:54,654
(A wedding town in Yeoju, Gyeonggi-do)

17
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:57,824
(Warm sunshine welcomes them to a forthcoming blessing.)

18
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,024
- It's warm. It's getting warmer. - It's sunny.

19
00:01:00,254 --> 00:01:02,754
I guess this week's episode is about you.

20
00:01:02,754 --> 00:01:04,824
- I think so. - Then please come to the center.

21
00:01:04,824 --> 00:01:06,624
- Everyone can guess that. - Yes, it's obvious.

22
00:01:06,624 --> 00:01:08,424
I assumed everyone's wearing a tuxedo.

23
00:01:08,424 --> 00:01:09,484
- I'm the only one. - Seok Jin.

24
00:01:09,484 --> 00:01:11,584
- Who wears pants like those? - This is...

25
00:01:12,384 --> 00:01:14,824
- Look at his hands. - Seok Jin.

26
00:01:14,984 --> 00:01:17,924
- It's cold. - You should've taken care of them.

27
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:20,254
The third participant of Member's Week is...

28
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:22,554
- Is it me? - It's Jee Seok Jin.

29
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:25,554
It looks like I'm getting married. It's obvious.

30
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:27,354
He's the third participant of Member's Week.

31
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:30,354
He's known as the dedicated husband in Running Man.

32
00:01:30,354 --> 00:01:32,354
- Why is that? - I'm very devoted and loving.

33
00:01:32,354 --> 00:01:33,884
Is it because of the lie detector?

34
00:01:33,884 --> 00:01:35,154
He said he would remarry...

35
00:01:35,154 --> 00:01:36,454
- his wife in his next life. - I am very dedicated.

36
00:01:36,454 --> 00:01:37,954
I remember now.

37
00:01:37,954 --> 00:01:41,184
"Will you marry your wife in your next life?"

38
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,584
(He nodded without giving a lot of thought.)

39
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:45,024
(He told the truth.)

40
00:01:45,024 --> 00:01:47,724
(The title of the dedicated husband went to the wrong person.)

41
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:51,184
I am truly in love with my wife.

42
00:01:51,254 --> 00:01:54,454
The evidence for it was broadcasted on a nationwide scale.

43
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:57,924
That's how I earned new nicknames such as The Devoted or The Loving.

44
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:02,224
We got married when she was quite young.

45
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:04,924
I haven't done any romantic events for her.

46
00:02:05,254 --> 00:02:07,554
If I have the opportunity, it would be nice to do one.

47
00:02:09,154 --> 00:02:10,254
He's a sunflower.

48
00:02:10,254 --> 00:02:14,754
For Seok Jin who only cares about his wife,

49
00:02:15,194 --> 00:02:17,924
we've prepared Seok Jin's vow renewal ceremony.

50
00:02:18,284 --> 00:02:21,924
- Please enter the wedding hall... - Are you serious?

51
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:23,694
- where the bride is waiting. - Really?

52
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:26,194
- Your wife is here? - We could've come together.

53
00:02:26,384 --> 00:02:28,254
- She said, "Have a good day." - This will be so touching.

54
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:30,884
- What is this? - Will I host the ceremony?

55
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:31,954
Of course, you will.

56
00:02:31,954 --> 00:02:35,024
- I set you up with her. - Yes, you should host the ceremony.

57
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:37,384
(Thanks to an unexpected event, everyone is excited.)

58
00:02:37,384 --> 00:02:42,984
(Just like the day 19 years ago, among the lights that bless them, )

59
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:50,554
(Seok Jin's beautiful wife stands before them.)

60
00:02:52,454 --> 00:02:53,854
Congratulations, Seok Jin.

61
00:02:54,124 --> 00:02:56,584
- What is this? - This is a wedding hall.

62
00:02:58,254 --> 00:02:59,984
His wife will be here?

63
00:03:02,324 --> 00:03:10,324
(Looking like she did 19 years ago, she waits for her husband.)

64
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:13,084
- His wife will be here? - Is it really her?

65
00:03:13,554 --> 00:03:16,054
- Seok Jin. Mrs. Jee. - Are you really here, Honey?

66
00:03:16,754 --> 00:03:19,254
(Honey, what are you doing there?)

67
00:03:19,254 --> 00:03:21,554
- Is she really here? - Is that you, Mrs. Jee?

68
00:03:22,624 --> 00:03:24,084
- Is it her? - It's not you, right?

69
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:26,554
- Is that you? - I don't think it's her.

70
00:03:27,284 --> 00:03:29,084
- Who is it? - Is that you?

71
00:03:29,184 --> 00:03:31,024
- I don't think it's her. - It's not her?

72
00:03:31,984 --> 00:03:33,384
Is that her?

73
00:03:34,454 --> 00:03:39,424
(Thank you for the past 19 years. I'll take better care of you.)

74
00:03:39,424 --> 00:03:41,884
- Is that her? - Hey.

75
00:03:41,924 --> 00:03:43,154
(What's going on?)

76
00:03:43,154 --> 00:03:45,484
- It's Lee Seul. - What?

77
00:03:45,484 --> 00:03:47,424
It's Lee Seul?

78
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:48,584
Hey, you.

79
00:03:48,584 --> 00:03:50,124
- Are you kidding? - You do all sorts of things now.

80
00:03:50,124 --> 00:03:52,154
- What's wrong with you? - You do all kinds of things.

81
00:03:52,154 --> 00:03:54,854
- Are you my wife for the day? - You are so brazen.

82
00:03:54,854 --> 00:03:57,184
- You look like my youngest sister. - Hey, you.

83
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:01,454
(What? Are they police officers?)

84
00:04:01,554 --> 00:04:02,824
- What's going on? - What is this?

85
00:04:02,824 --> 00:04:05,154
- My goodness. What's going on? - Why are they here?

86
00:04:05,154 --> 00:04:07,054
(The police officers are on the move.)

87
00:04:07,054 --> 00:04:09,084
- Why are they coming to us? - What is it?

88
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:10,554
- Come on. What is it? - What's going on?

89
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:12,854
- This always happens. - Come on.

90
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:14,854
- We did something wrong again. - What are you doing?

91
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,224
- What did we do wrong? - Why are you doing this?

92
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:19,854
What did we do? Hold on.

93
00:04:20,584 --> 00:04:22,324
What's the matter? Lee Seul!

94
00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:24,384
- Kwang Soo. - Lee Seul.

95
00:04:24,884 --> 00:04:26,784
- What's happening? - We're at a wedding hall.

96
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:28,384
- Be careful. - What is it?

97
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:30,524
I thought they were going to renew their vows!

98
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:32,384
Where are we going?

99
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:34,224
- Why are you doing this? - Hold on.

100
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:35,994
This is ridiculous. Come on.

101
00:04:35,994 --> 00:04:37,384
(Their arrest warrants have been issued out of the blue.)

102
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:38,424
(Where are we going?)

103
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:39,724
- My goodness. - Where are we headed?

104
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:44,254
Where are we going? Seok Jin. Where are we going?

105
00:04:44,254 --> 00:04:46,954
- That's what I want to ask, too. - I really don't know.

106
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,124
Hey, someone's taking me somewhere.

107
00:04:49,424 --> 00:04:51,684
- This is so scary. - First, let Ji Hyo...

108
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:54,124
- I'm going, too? - Let go of me. Let go!

109
00:04:54,154 --> 00:04:56,784
After the opening segment, I've been dragged around all day long.

110
00:04:57,124 --> 00:04:59,684
(Where is this place?)

111
00:04:59,954 --> 00:05:04,324
(It's Seok Jin's Prison, the shrine for criminals from variety shows.)

112
00:05:04,324 --> 00:05:09,584
(It's a correction center that has strict management and control.)

113
00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:13,454
(One rule of Seok Jin's Prison is not to ask and not to talk back.)

114
00:05:13,454 --> 00:05:16,584
(Will they be able to escape from this suffocating prison?)

115
00:05:16,924 --> 00:05:20,084
Now, you can take your blindfolds off.

116
00:05:20,184 --> 00:05:22,384
- What is it? Where are we? - My goodness.

117
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:23,584
(The prisoners get to see some light after an hour.)

118
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:25,284
- What is it? - This is a prison.

119
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,424
- We are in prison. - My gosh.

120
00:05:27,424 --> 00:05:29,784
- Seok Jin's Prison. - It says "Seok Jin's Prison".

121
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:32,354
- "Seok Jin's Prison"? - What is this?

122
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:34,584
"The boss' word is the law." Are you the boss?

123
00:05:34,654 --> 00:05:36,254
Seok Jin, the participant...

124
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:39,684
of this week's episode, wanted everything in here.

125
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:42,024
- He wanted this? - Yes, I did. However,

126
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:43,954
- this is not... - What's wrong with you?

127
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:46,684
I only said that I wanted to put all of you in prison.

128
00:05:47,684 --> 00:05:50,284
I thought about it and I have something.

129
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:52,424
I spent more time in prison than I did outside.

130
00:05:52,424 --> 00:05:56,724
I want them to experience how painful it feels to be in prison.

131
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:59,654
I want to put all of them in prison...

132
00:05:59,654 --> 00:06:02,224
and be the king in there.

133
00:06:02,224 --> 00:06:04,584
(He will humiliate the rest of them in his hometown.)

134
00:06:04,584 --> 00:06:06,224
- I told them to put you in prison. - Seok Jin.

135
00:06:06,224 --> 00:06:07,624
Then why did you wear a tuxedo?

136
00:06:07,624 --> 00:06:09,454
- Why did you put me in, too? - Goodness.

137
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:11,584
- Why did we go to the wedding hall? - Yes, why did we?

138
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:12,654
- Why am I here? - Seok Jin.

139
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:14,484
Your wife wanted you here.

140
00:06:14,484 --> 00:06:15,624
Is that what happened?

141
00:06:15,884 --> 00:06:17,224
Why am I here?

142
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:20,024
Your sentence in this prison is six hours.

143
00:06:20,024 --> 00:06:23,084
You will follow the schedule which has been already made for you.

144
00:06:23,254 --> 00:06:25,424
Seok Jin is the boss of this prison.

145
00:06:25,424 --> 00:06:26,784
I am the boss?

146
00:06:26,784 --> 00:06:28,554
He has the absolute authority.

147
00:06:29,184 --> 00:06:31,484
He can send whoever offends him and causes...

148
00:06:31,484 --> 00:06:34,484
chaos in the prison to solitary confinement.

149
00:06:34,484 --> 00:06:37,384
- My time has finally come. - This is too cruel.

150
00:06:37,454 --> 00:06:39,824
Is it scary to be in solitary confinement?

151
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:44,254
For your information, solitary confinement will be beyond...

152
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:47,784
your imagination. Whatever you imagine, it'll be worse.

153
00:06:47,784 --> 00:06:51,484
(Solitary confinement is a mysterious and unpredictable place.)

154
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:53,054
Whatever you imagine, it'll be worse.

155
00:06:53,054 --> 00:06:55,054
(Solitary confinement is...)

156
00:06:55,054 --> 00:07:00,884
(the deepest and the dreariest place in prison.)

157
00:07:02,184 --> 00:07:05,554
(Solitary confinement is the darkest place in Seok Jin's Prison.)

158
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,024
- Behave. I'm the boss today. - Seok Jin's the boss.

159
00:07:09,484 --> 00:07:11,484
- We'd better listen to him. - You'd better.

160
00:07:11,554 --> 00:07:13,954
You. Don't make eye contact with me.

161
00:07:13,954 --> 00:07:16,524
- You. - Don't look him in the eye.

162
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:17,624
Don't look at me like that.

163
00:07:17,624 --> 00:07:19,884
(He seizes the chance and stands next to the boss.)

164
00:07:19,884 --> 00:07:21,454
- Are you my right-hand man? - Yes, Sir.

165
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:25,424
Hey, Right-hand.

166
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:26,854
- Yes, Sir. - He's annoying me.

167
00:07:27,024 --> 00:07:29,484
I'm sorry but I believe I look more like the right-hand man.

168
00:07:29,484 --> 00:07:31,224
You can be my right-hand man, too.

169
00:07:31,224 --> 00:07:32,554
So it's starting again.

170
00:07:32,554 --> 00:07:34,284
Be quiet. Look down.

171
00:07:34,284 --> 00:07:35,784
Honestly, I'm okay, right?

172
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:37,254
- Be quiet. - Look down.

173
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:38,724
I'll be your pet dog!

174
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,384
Really?

175
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:42,154
(However, the sweet taste of power leaves its bitter aftertaste.)

176
00:07:43,284 --> 00:07:44,454
- What is this? - What is this?

177
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:47,624
(The 6 prisoners start their life at Seok Jin's Prison.)

178
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,354
What is happening?

179
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:50,724
It's only the beginning.

180
00:07:50,724 --> 00:07:52,524
(Why the sirens?)

181
00:07:52,524 --> 00:07:54,384
Is six lives of imprisonment beginning now?

182
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,254
Six lives of imprisonment?

183
00:07:56,254 --> 00:07:57,424
I meant six hours.

184
00:07:58,024 --> 00:07:59,224
I'm the boss.

185
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:01,124
You made a mistake.

186
00:08:01,424 --> 00:08:04,424
You said six lives of imprisonment.

187
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,084
"Is six lives of imprisonment beginning now?"

188
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,224
(Are you making fun of the boss?)

189
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:12,224
I think he'll be sent away to solitary confinement soon.

190
00:08:12,354 --> 00:08:13,654
You shouldn't do that.

191
00:08:13,654 --> 00:08:15,684
Okay. I understand.

192
00:08:15,684 --> 00:08:16,854
I wanted to apologize.

193
00:08:17,754 --> 00:08:20,954
(All power in Seok Jin's Prison comes from Seok Jin.)

194
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:23,284
(The boss' word is the law.)

195
00:08:23,484 --> 00:08:25,054
I'll be asking you...

196
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:27,254
to compliment...

197
00:08:27,254 --> 00:08:28,754
(Compliment your boss.)

198
00:08:28,754 --> 00:08:29,884
your boss today.

199
00:08:30,184 --> 00:08:31,954
I'll be asking each one of you one by one.

200
00:08:31,954 --> 00:08:32,984
(I have to lie to my conscience.)

201
00:08:32,984 --> 00:08:35,654
If I don't like it, you'll be sent to solitary confinement.

202
00:08:35,684 --> 00:08:39,654
- Okay. - Even one word matters or else.

203
00:08:39,654 --> 00:08:42,284
Ji Hyo, make an acrostic poem for Jee Seok Jin.

204
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,224
Jee.

205
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,184
At this very moment...

206
00:08:46,654 --> 00:08:48,054
I like how it starts.

207
00:08:48,424 --> 00:08:49,484
Seok.

208
00:08:50,224 --> 00:08:51,484
Whatever Seok Jin says...

209
00:08:52,254 --> 00:08:53,384
Jin.

210
00:08:54,094 --> 00:08:55,724
I love him with all my heart.

211
00:08:57,224 --> 00:09:00,124
(She exchanges her conscience with her fake heart.)

212
00:09:00,284 --> 00:09:01,784
(This is what power tastes like.)

213
00:09:01,784 --> 00:09:02,884
What is she doing?

214
00:09:02,984 --> 00:09:05,254
Haha, make an acrostic poem for Jee Seok Jin.

215
00:09:05,424 --> 00:09:06,624
Jee.

216
00:09:07,324 --> 00:09:08,554
Mind your own business.

217
00:09:08,554 --> 00:09:10,754
(Mind your own business.)

218
00:09:11,754 --> 00:09:13,324
It's only the first line.

219
00:09:13,324 --> 00:09:14,484
- No, I didn't mean that. - You should listen to the rest.

220
00:09:14,484 --> 00:09:15,484
So I have to listen to the rest?

221
00:09:15,484 --> 00:09:17,124
You have to wait until the end.

222
00:09:17,554 --> 00:09:18,624
Seok.

223
00:09:18,954 --> 00:09:20,924
You should try to be like Seok Jin.

224
00:09:20,954 --> 00:09:22,924
(You should try to be like Seok Jin.)

225
00:09:22,954 --> 00:09:25,124
If I don't like it, you are going to solitary confinement. Jin.

226
00:09:25,254 --> 00:09:26,484
He's a real man.

227
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:28,784
He's a bulldozer.

228
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:31,354
Go, Seok Jin.

229
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:33,324
(The last part about the bulldozer was touching.)

230
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:36,454
Go, Seok Jin, the icon of power.

231
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:39,024
(I like it.)

232
00:09:39,024 --> 00:09:40,094
Okay.

233
00:09:40,094 --> 00:09:41,254
- Jong Kook. - Yes.

234
00:09:41,254 --> 00:09:42,954
Make an acrostic poem. Jee.

235
00:09:43,484 --> 00:09:44,784
Dear Jee Seok Jin.

236
00:09:45,094 --> 00:09:46,224
Seok.

237
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:47,684
I apologize.

238
00:09:49,324 --> 00:09:50,784
- What is this? - Jin.

239
00:09:50,784 --> 00:09:52,854
I sincerely apologize...

240
00:09:53,724 --> 00:09:55,354
for making fun of you in the past.

241
00:09:55,354 --> 00:09:58,384
- What has happened to him? - I can feel his sincerity.

242
00:09:58,384 --> 00:10:01,054
(The solitary confinement card makes him get on his knees.)

243
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:03,754
(This is what power tastes like.)

244
00:10:03,754 --> 00:10:06,384
Jae Seok, make an acrostic poem.

245
00:10:07,094 --> 00:10:08,184
Jee.

246
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:12,784
Jee Seok Jin!

247
00:10:12,784 --> 00:10:16,184
(Jae Seok is a well-known expert in making fun of Seok Jin.)

248
00:10:16,184 --> 00:10:20,284
(Seok Jin used to be his easiest mark.)

249
00:10:20,284 --> 00:10:22,854
(How will he praise the absolute power that empowered Jong Kook?)

250
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:23,924
Jee.

251
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:25,854
Jee Seok Jin.

252
00:10:26,384 --> 00:10:27,554
Seok.

253
00:10:27,554 --> 00:10:28,554
The billionaire.

254
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,284
What's that supposed to mean?

255
00:10:30,284 --> 00:10:31,784
What do you mean by that?

256
00:10:31,784 --> 00:10:34,254
Why billionaire?

257
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:35,524
You're really funny.

258
00:10:35,524 --> 00:10:38,054
- That's what acrostic poem is like. - But I actually feel good.

259
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,554
- I know, right? - Billionaire.

260
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:41,384
- Jee Seok Jin, the billionaire. - Jin.

261
00:10:41,384 --> 00:10:42,924
You're the real billionaire.

262
00:10:42,924 --> 00:10:44,224
(He is very satisfied.)

263
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:45,984
It's meaningless.

264
00:10:45,984 --> 00:10:47,824
- What exactly does he mean? - Why are you satisfied?

265
00:10:47,824 --> 00:10:48,854
Isn't he making fun of you?

266
00:10:48,854 --> 00:10:51,324
- Billionaire sounds nice. - You are the true billionaire.

267
00:10:52,224 --> 00:10:54,184
(Jae Seok's second acrostic poem)

268
00:10:54,184 --> 00:10:59,084
Who is he to boast around and pretend he is the boss,

269
00:10:59,084 --> 00:11:00,984
bossing us around like that?

270
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:02,584
He's trying to take everything for himself.

271
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:05,054
You should go to the solitary confinement.

272
00:11:05,724 --> 00:11:07,524
I'm not done with my poem yet.

273
00:11:07,524 --> 00:11:09,084
Was that for the letter "Jee"? It's that long?

274
00:11:09,354 --> 00:11:10,784
- He's not done yet. - That was for "Jee".

275
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:12,984
- He's not done. - I was just starting.

276
00:11:12,984 --> 00:11:14,784
- Can you repeat the poem? - Of course.

277
00:11:14,784 --> 00:11:16,354
- Can you repeat the poem? - Yes, I can.

278
00:11:16,354 --> 00:11:18,084
Who is he to boast around and pretend he is the boss...

279
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:20,084
(I'll say it again if you want.)

280
00:11:20,584 --> 00:11:22,054
(He is upset.)

281
00:11:22,524 --> 00:11:24,424
- However, - However?

282
00:11:24,854 --> 00:11:26,024
- Seok. - you're the true billionaire.

283
00:11:28,224 --> 00:11:29,584
Why a billionaire?

284
00:11:30,354 --> 00:11:32,254
- What does that mean? - That's how you make a poem.

285
00:11:32,254 --> 00:11:34,084
- What is that? - Why is he satisfied?

286
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:35,824
That's how you make an acrostic poem.

287
00:11:36,254 --> 00:11:38,124
- Jin. - You're the true billionaire.

288
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,154
- What does that mean? - He's the richest man.

289
00:11:41,154 --> 00:11:43,524
Strangely, I feel good when he calls me a billionaire.

290
00:11:43,524 --> 00:11:45,754
- Yes, you're a billionaire. - I love hearing that.

291
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:46,954
That means he's rich.

292
00:11:47,384 --> 00:11:48,884
- Stand over there. - By the way,

293
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:51,024
- Stand over there. - Are we working for an hour?

294
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:52,724
Boss, how does this schedule work?

295
00:11:52,724 --> 00:11:54,554
I simply wanted to lock you up.

296
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:57,754
This isn't fair.

297
00:11:57,754 --> 00:11:58,954
(Falling)

298
00:11:59,184 --> 00:12:00,854
How dare you say that?

299
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,154
Hey. Hey!

300
00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:05,854
- I'll use the card on you. - What card?

301
00:12:05,854 --> 00:12:07,384
- The solitary confinement card. - Where is it?

302
00:12:07,954 --> 00:12:09,324
- It's in here. - Where? Let me see.

303
00:12:09,324 --> 00:12:10,884
- It's in here. - Where? Do you really have it?

304
00:12:10,884 --> 00:12:12,324
- It's right here. - You really do.

305
00:12:14,254 --> 00:12:15,554
Okay, Sir.

306
00:12:15,554 --> 00:12:16,754
(I must have lost my mind for a minute.)

307
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:20,084
- You shouldn't behave like that. - Okay, Boss.

308
00:12:20,084 --> 00:12:22,154
- Send him away. - He should learn to look down.

309
00:12:22,154 --> 00:12:24,284
- Stand up. Who told you to sit? - Okay.

310
00:12:24,384 --> 00:12:25,784
- He should be sent away. - Okay.

311
00:12:25,784 --> 00:12:27,524
I must have been out of my mind for a moment.

312
00:12:27,524 --> 00:12:29,284
- I'll be obedient. - Okay.

313
00:12:29,284 --> 00:12:31,254
Make an acrostic poem for Jee Seok Jin. Jee.

314
00:12:31,254 --> 00:12:32,424
Jee.

315
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:34,824
You must be a nutcase.

316
00:12:36,124 --> 00:12:37,684
(How could he...)

317
00:12:37,684 --> 00:12:39,224
Send him to solitary confinement!

318
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:42,084
(He's the first prisoner at the solitary confinement.)

319
00:12:42,084 --> 00:12:43,924
- Hey. - Go. Go away.

320
00:12:43,924 --> 00:12:45,924
- I'm so sorry. - Solitary confinement.

321
00:12:45,924 --> 00:12:48,984
- What I said... - Send him away!

322
00:12:48,984 --> 00:12:50,654
- Wait, wait. - You need to be punished.

323
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:52,784
- Can this part be broadcasted? - Yes, it can.

324
00:12:52,784 --> 00:12:54,984
- It can? - It will be censored.

325
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,824
This can't be happening to me.

326
00:12:58,824 --> 00:13:00,254
It's really a solitary confinement?

327
00:13:00,984 --> 00:13:03,924
(This room will make 5 minutes seem like 5 years.)

328
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:06,484
They told us that solitary confinement is really scary.

329
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:08,124
Even I don't know what it looks like.

330
00:13:08,884 --> 00:13:10,454
- What is this? - What is it?

331
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:12,154
- What is it? - No!

332
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:13,154
What is it?

333
00:13:13,154 --> 00:13:15,684
(He tries to run away.)

334
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,424
- What is this? - What's happening?

335
00:13:17,424 --> 00:13:19,584
- Is this real? - He doesn't seem to be faking it.

336
00:13:20,724 --> 00:13:23,184
(How scary is the place?)

337
00:13:23,184 --> 00:13:25,124
No, no.

338
00:13:26,784 --> 00:13:29,684
(It's an unknown place where you don't know what will happen.)

339
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,884
Please!

340
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:33,154
No.

341
00:13:33,154 --> 00:13:35,454
(It's creepy.)

342
00:13:37,054 --> 00:13:38,554
No.

343
00:13:38,554 --> 00:13:41,684
(Finally, the doors to the solitary confinement are open.)

344
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:44,724
(Surprised)

345
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:49,684
What is this?

346
00:13:53,954 --> 00:13:55,254
What is all this?

347
00:13:55,254 --> 00:13:59,124
(This solitary confinement serves as a healing room.)

348
00:13:59,124 --> 00:14:01,254
(It's a comfortable, healing spot that can help everyone relax.)

349
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:02,384
This is the best place ever.

350
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:04,054
The solitary confinement is the best.

351
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:06,384
(Is this really happening? Cheer for solitary confinement!)

352
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:08,724
(This is the best thing ever.)

353
00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:11,224
This is really cool.

354
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:14,354
(There's plenty of nutritious food for the prisoners.)

355
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,154
I feel sorry for Seok Jin.

356
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:20,254
What should I do? They even have sweets.

357
00:14:20,254 --> 00:14:22,784
(This is a 5-minute-long rest at the solitary confinement room.)

358
00:14:24,824 --> 00:14:26,124
I really like it here.

359
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:29,824
I was taken aback.

360
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:31,424
(The others have no idea.)

361
00:14:31,424 --> 00:14:32,954
It's so comfortable.

362
00:14:33,854 --> 00:14:38,584
(This is the future-oriented and advanced Seok Jin's Prison.)

363
00:14:39,154 --> 00:14:41,754
(Meanwhile, the other prisoners don't know what's going on.)

364
00:14:43,524 --> 00:14:44,784
You look cool.

365
00:14:44,954 --> 00:14:46,284
- Give me a massage. - He wasn't lying.

366
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:48,824
- Is this all real? - Of course.

367
00:14:49,084 --> 00:14:51,154
Of course.

368
00:14:51,354 --> 00:14:53,324
You look charismatic.

369
00:14:53,854 --> 00:14:56,684
Jae Seok has made fun of me all his life.

370
00:14:56,684 --> 00:14:58,024
- You did well. - Hey.

371
00:14:58,154 --> 00:14:59,524
You should also...

372
00:14:59,824 --> 00:15:00,924
smile a bit more.

373
00:15:01,054 --> 00:15:02,584
(Smiling)

374
00:15:02,584 --> 00:15:04,824
Yes, that looks better.

375
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,324
(He's fully enjoying the power.)

376
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:08,454
This feels good.

377
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:10,324
- Jae Seok should behave. - He should.

378
00:15:10,324 --> 00:15:11,354
(Jae Seok, have a taste of the solitary confinement.)

379
00:15:11,654 --> 00:15:14,484
(I'm going to have a taste of this citrus tea.)

380
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:16,784
I think I'll be the only one coming here.

381
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,324
You have two minutes left.

382
00:15:20,324 --> 00:15:23,184
What do you mean two minutes? I just came in here.

383
00:15:23,184 --> 00:15:25,284
(A minute in here feels like a second.)

384
00:15:25,284 --> 00:15:28,884
(He's enjoying his leisure time with a cup of tea.)

385
00:15:28,884 --> 00:15:30,284
This feels nice.

386
00:15:32,884 --> 00:15:34,284
It's better than my house.

387
00:15:35,984 --> 00:15:39,954
(It's the perfect day to drink citrus tea.)

388
00:15:40,824 --> 00:15:41,854
What?

389
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:42,924
(The guard approaches him.)

390
00:15:43,584 --> 00:15:44,654
I can't go out now.

391
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:46,924
I haven't been here for long.

392
00:15:47,224 --> 00:15:49,354
Wait... I...

393
00:15:49,354 --> 00:15:50,624
I just made my tea.

394
00:15:50,624 --> 00:15:52,324
(Can't a man drink some tea?)

395
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:55,024
I'll be back before it gets cold.

396
00:15:55,784 --> 00:15:57,124
I'll be back soon.

397
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,354
(I'll have the solitary confinement all to myself.)

398
00:16:00,284 --> 00:16:01,724
Are we going to follow the schedule?

399
00:16:02,384 --> 00:16:03,424
- Of course. - There's a schedule.

400
00:16:03,424 --> 00:16:05,984
- We have to work first. - What kind of work?

401
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:07,324
What kind of work?

402
00:16:07,324 --> 00:16:08,754
Maybe it's something like shoveling?

403
00:16:08,754 --> 00:16:10,584
- It could be an exercise. - Maybe it's pulling weeds?

404
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:12,684
You are really good at working.

405
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:15,284
- What? - You can just sing "Last Love".

406
00:16:15,284 --> 00:16:16,554
("Last Love" works best.)

407
00:16:18,084 --> 00:16:23,754
(He's the best worker with a sweet voice and snake-like eyes.)

408
00:16:24,324 --> 00:16:25,924
(He is embarrassed.)

409
00:16:25,924 --> 00:16:27,054
I'm so sorry.

410
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:30,554
I'm so sorry. I won't do that again.

411
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:33,584
- What is happening? - He sounds well-disciplined.

412
00:16:33,584 --> 00:16:34,754
I won't do that again.

413
00:16:35,484 --> 00:16:37,554
It's so cold in there.

414
00:16:37,554 --> 00:16:38,984
It's really cold.

415
00:16:38,984 --> 00:16:40,624
- It sounds real. - Did he say it's cold?

416
00:16:40,754 --> 00:16:43,354
- No, I'll never do that again. - He says he won't do it again.

417
00:16:43,384 --> 00:16:45,484
- I'll never do that again. - What is it like in there?

418
00:16:45,624 --> 00:16:47,184
He has become a little child.

419
00:16:47,184 --> 00:16:48,884
- What's he saying? - I won't do that again.

420
00:16:49,024 --> 00:16:51,354
- Has he been disciplined? - What did you do?

421
00:16:51,354 --> 00:16:52,924
You are well-disciplined.

422
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,124
It's so cold in there.

423
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:55,484
Attention.

424
00:16:55,654 --> 00:16:56,924
At ease.

425
00:16:56,924 --> 00:16:58,254
- Attention. - He's really doing it.

426
00:16:58,454 --> 00:17:00,584
- He must have been sitting on ice. - He's obedient.

427
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:01,924
I will never ever make the same mistakes.

428
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:03,254
Show me the Grasshopper Dance.

429
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:05,654
(I will dance any time.)

430
00:17:05,654 --> 00:17:06,824
Now, the Dooly Dance.

431
00:17:07,154 --> 00:17:09,384
(To return to the solitary confinement, he's doing his best.)

432
00:17:09,984 --> 00:17:12,084
I don't want to go back there again.

433
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:13,724
- Never? - Never.

434
00:17:13,724 --> 00:17:15,224
- Are you curious? - No, I'm not.

435
00:17:15,224 --> 00:17:16,424
- Tell me if you want to go there. - No, I don't want to go there.

436
00:17:16,454 --> 00:17:19,124
(He swears his loyalty to the boss.)

437
00:17:19,124 --> 00:17:20,484
(What is the sound?)

438
00:17:20,484 --> 00:17:21,854
What's going on?

439
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:25,224
It's time for the first task.

440
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:26,354
(Their work starts.)

441
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:27,654
What's going on?

442
00:17:28,124 --> 00:17:29,484
What is that?

443
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:30,484
(Why is there a sack?)

444
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:33,584
Are they making us search for barley?

445
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:36,254
(That's exactly it.)

446
00:17:37,184 --> 00:17:38,224
(It's the most tedious work.)

447
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,124
Do we have to separate the red beans?

448
00:17:40,124 --> 00:17:41,724
(They must separate yellow and red beans.)

449
00:17:41,724 --> 00:17:44,124
- Seriously? - Do we need to separate the beans?

450
00:17:44,124 --> 00:17:45,684
Do you want us to separate them?

451
00:17:45,754 --> 00:17:47,884
The boss doesn't have to do it.

452
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:49,924
He can distribute the work to the others.

453
00:17:49,924 --> 00:17:51,624
Shouldn't the boss do it, too?

454
00:17:51,624 --> 00:17:52,954
What did you say?

455
00:17:53,254 --> 00:17:54,954
How dare you say that?

456
00:17:55,724 --> 00:17:58,084
- Show your respect to the boss. - Hey, hey.

457
00:17:58,084 --> 00:18:00,224
Starting now, Jae Seok shall treat Haha with respect.

458
00:18:00,224 --> 00:18:02,654
- Okay, Sir. - Haha is above Jae Seok.

459
00:18:02,654 --> 00:18:04,524
- Thank you. - Call him Mr. Haha.

460
00:18:04,524 --> 00:18:05,824
Say Mr. Haha.

461
00:18:05,824 --> 00:18:07,924
This isn't right, Seok Jin.

462
00:18:07,924 --> 00:18:09,254
(Seok Jin is being immature.)

463
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,484
Call him Mr. Haha.

464
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:12,424
Gosh, Mr. Haha.

465
00:18:13,024 --> 00:18:14,654
(Haha can't believe what he heard.)

466
00:18:14,654 --> 00:18:16,724
- You're above him. - Goodness.

467
00:18:16,724 --> 00:18:19,354
Kwang Soo, you're above...

468
00:18:19,624 --> 00:18:21,524
- Jae Seok as well. - Okay, Sir.

469
00:18:21,524 --> 00:18:23,054
Call him Mr. Kwang Soo.

470
00:18:23,454 --> 00:18:24,854
Come on.

471
00:18:25,624 --> 00:18:28,324
(How dare you disrespect me?)

472
00:18:29,324 --> 00:18:30,524
Hey, you.

473
00:18:30,654 --> 00:18:33,184
- He deserves a beating. - He's not well-disciplined.

474
00:18:33,184 --> 00:18:34,724
I don't like his attitude.

475
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:36,084
(It's time for solitary confinement again.)

476
00:18:36,294 --> 00:18:37,484
- Jong Kook. - Yes, Sir.

477
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:38,884
You're above Jae Seok, too.

478
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,954
Of course, I already knew that.

479
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:44,224
- You don't need to mention it. - That's obvious.

480
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:46,684
- Ji Hyo is above Jae Seok. - Ms. Ji Hyo.

481
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:49,294
- Separate the red beans now. - Okay, Sir.

482
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,384
- We'll work hard. - You're a community.

483
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:52,724
- Understand? - Yes, Sir.

484
00:18:52,724 --> 00:18:57,354
Do you know why I'm the boss? I've been here for 20 years.

485
00:18:57,354 --> 00:19:00,024
- It's been that long. - When will you be released?

486
00:19:00,024 --> 00:19:03,384
I received a 20-year sentence for loving my wife too much.

487
00:19:03,654 --> 00:19:04,654
(Seok Jin brags.)

488
00:19:04,654 --> 00:19:07,224
My only sin was loving my wife too much.

489
00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:09,224
Jae Seok, which crime did you commit?

490
00:19:09,424 --> 00:19:12,224
I'm an economic criminal.

491
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:15,924
I shouldn't even be confined here with you.

492
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:18,024
Didn't you commit petty crimes?

493
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:23,424
(Did he say petty crimes?)

494
00:19:23,724 --> 00:19:26,124
(Jae Seok tries to aggravate him.)

495
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:31,354
(It's his strategy to go back to solitary confinement.)

496
00:19:31,684 --> 00:19:32,754
(He considers sending him back.)

497
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,854
I heard that you were caught gambling.

498
00:19:35,854 --> 00:19:37,724
- Everyone, stand up. - No.

499
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:39,654
(He orders everyone to stand up.)

500
00:19:39,654 --> 00:19:41,184
Everyone, get up.

501
00:19:41,184 --> 00:19:43,294
- I didn't say anything. - I told you.

502
00:19:43,294 --> 00:19:45,984
You're a community, so everyone, get up.

503
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,924
- Stand in one line. - Why are you interrupting us?

504
00:19:48,924 --> 00:19:51,424
(Jae Seok is making it worse for everyone.)

505
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:53,024
Why are you interrupting us?

506
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:55,294
Line up like a train and hold the waist in the front.

507
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,294
- Like a train? - Right.

508
00:19:57,294 --> 00:19:58,524
Sit down.

509
00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:00,254
Duckwalk around the cell once.

510
00:20:00,254 --> 00:20:01,724
- Are you serious? - Come on.

511
00:20:01,924 --> 00:20:03,454
- Start. - Wait.

512
00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:05,554
Say, "The boss' word is the law." The boss' word...

513
00:20:05,554 --> 00:20:07,454
- Is the law. - The boss' word...

514
00:20:07,454 --> 00:20:08,884
- Is the law! - The boss' word...

515
00:20:08,884 --> 00:20:11,024
(Seok Jin spots Jae Seok.)

516
00:20:11,024 --> 00:20:12,924
- Is the law! - What are you doing?

517
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:14,624
- What are you doing? - What's wrong?

518
00:20:14,624 --> 00:20:16,294
(Send me to solitary confinement.)

519
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:18,224
Don't you understand the situation?

520
00:20:18,224 --> 00:20:20,354
- We're in prison. - Calm down, Haha.

521
00:20:20,354 --> 00:20:22,984
Send Jae Seok to solitary confinement.

522
00:20:22,984 --> 00:20:25,024
(He deserves to be punished.)

523
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:27,384
(Jae Seok is sent to solitary confinement.)

524
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:30,454
- Good job. - I'm sorry, Sir.

525
00:20:30,454 --> 00:20:31,794
- I'm sorry. - Go now.

526
00:20:31,824 --> 00:20:34,484
I wasn't strong enough to suppress my stress.

527
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,124
I couldn't control my anger.

528
00:20:36,124 --> 00:20:38,184
- He deserves worse punishment. - I'm sorry.

529
00:20:38,184 --> 00:20:39,754
(He's excited to drink some tea.)

530
00:20:39,754 --> 00:20:40,754
I'm sorry.

531
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:43,384
(He passionately acts.)

532
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:45,484
I'm really sorry.

533
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:48,454
Solitary confinement must be terrible.

534
00:20:48,454 --> 00:20:51,584
- He didn't change much physically. - Right.

535
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,624
I wonder if they torture him psychologically.

536
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:59,124
(Solitary confinement is better than hotels.)

537
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,324
(He enjoys some snack.)

538
00:21:03,224 --> 00:21:05,524
Kwang Soo might have noticed.

539
00:21:06,524 --> 00:21:10,524
(Kwang Soo is the curious type.)

540
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:13,754
I wonder what he does over there.

541
00:21:14,654 --> 00:21:16,294
You should go if you're curious.

542
00:21:16,554 --> 00:21:18,684
- Do you want to go? - It's okay, Sir.

543
00:21:20,384 --> 00:21:22,794
Kwang Soo is too curious to stay still.

544
00:21:25,794 --> 00:21:27,024
Jong Kook.

545
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:28,524
(To Kwang Soo, )

546
00:21:28,524 --> 00:21:32,324
(solitary confinement is a world full of mysteries.)

547
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,294
No!

548
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,454
(Come in. You won't regret it.)

549
00:21:40,724 --> 00:21:43,384
- I won't do it ever again. - Go to the corner and kneel.

550
00:21:43,384 --> 00:21:46,824
- Why don't you behave yourself? - Go and kneel.

551
00:21:46,984 --> 00:21:49,124
(Is something good in the solitary confinement?)

552
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:51,454
Kwang Soo, aren't you curious about the solitary confinement?

553
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:53,084
- Aren't you? - I'm curious.

554
00:21:53,084 --> 00:21:54,124
Right?

555
00:21:54,124 --> 00:21:57,724
Hit Seok Jin's head once and check it out.

556
00:21:58,324 --> 00:22:00,354
I'm not sure.

557
00:22:00,354 --> 00:22:01,984
(He hesitates to go.)

558
00:22:02,624 --> 00:22:03,724
Are you curious?

559
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:06,724
(Are you bold enough to be curious?)

560
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:10,324
(Kwang Soo decides...)

561
00:22:10,324 --> 00:22:12,984
(to check the world of the unknown.)

562
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:16,884
(It's a mutiny in prison.)

563
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:17,984
Go ahead.

564
00:22:17,984 --> 00:22:20,024
(It's too easy to go to solitary confinement.)

565
00:22:20,024 --> 00:22:21,884
- Go ahead. - Stop it.

566
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:22,984
(He sends Kwang Soo.)

567
00:22:23,284 --> 00:22:25,524
- I'll be back. - Have a good time.

568
00:22:25,524 --> 00:22:28,124
- Have a good time. - I'm too curious.

569
00:22:28,384 --> 00:22:29,984
(Is he really the boss?)

570
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:33,624
- Go ahead. - It's too hard to stay curious.

571
00:22:34,024 --> 00:22:36,024
(Kwang Soo is nervous to find out.)

572
00:22:36,024 --> 00:22:37,024
It's better to find out.

573
00:22:38,354 --> 00:22:40,554
Wait, no!

574
00:22:42,224 --> 00:22:44,724
- What could it possibly be? - Goodness.

575
00:22:44,724 --> 00:22:46,084
(They get curious more and more.)

576
00:22:50,484 --> 00:22:52,024
(He starts to smile.)

577
00:22:53,484 --> 00:22:55,384
(He screams.)

578
00:22:55,384 --> 00:22:57,284
(This is amazing!)

579
00:22:57,284 --> 00:22:59,654
(Is this solitary confinement?)

580
00:23:00,154 --> 00:23:01,484
(He welcomes himself.)

581
00:23:02,454 --> 00:23:03,454
Please!

582
00:23:03,454 --> 00:23:05,384
(It's a new type of solitary confinement.)

583
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,784
Did you already separate this many?

584
00:23:09,184 --> 00:23:11,124
Jong Kook is good at it.

585
00:23:11,124 --> 00:23:13,184
He's very good at tedious work.

586
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:14,184
(Jae Seok gets playful.)

587
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,754
He's very good at tedious work.

588
00:23:15,754 --> 00:23:17,624
(Stop doing tedious work.)

589
00:23:17,624 --> 00:23:19,554
What's wrong with you?

590
00:23:20,754 --> 00:23:21,884
(He wants to provoke everyone.)

591
00:23:23,884 --> 00:23:26,454
- Have you lost your mind? - What's wrong with you?

592
00:23:26,454 --> 00:23:27,724
Why?

593
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:30,024
- Why are you doing this? - Why not?

594
00:23:30,024 --> 00:23:32,654
- You don't need to do this. - I worked hard.

595
00:23:32,654 --> 00:23:35,454
(The tedious task hypnotizes the prisoners.)

596
00:23:36,554 --> 00:23:38,284
(The boss is angry.)

597
00:23:38,524 --> 00:23:39,654
What is it?

598
00:23:39,824 --> 00:23:40,824
(He flips Haha's bowl.)

599
00:23:42,624 --> 00:23:44,124
What are you doing?

600
00:23:44,354 --> 00:23:45,554
Do you want to know?

601
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:46,654
(If you're curious...)

602
00:23:46,654 --> 00:23:47,924
Do you want to start?

603
00:23:47,924 --> 00:23:50,384
(You know what to do.)

604
00:23:50,384 --> 00:23:52,454
(Just kick Seok Jin.)

605
00:23:52,454 --> 00:23:53,624
Yes, I want to know.

606
00:23:53,624 --> 00:23:55,454
(Just kick Seok Jin.)

607
00:23:55,454 --> 00:23:56,784
I want to know.

608
00:23:56,984 --> 00:23:58,124
Take out the card now.

609
00:23:58,624 --> 00:23:59,824
I want to go to solitary confinement.

610
00:23:59,824 --> 00:24:01,354
This is unbelievable.

611
00:24:01,354 --> 00:24:02,524
(Everyone sends themselves to solitary confinement.)

612
00:24:02,824 --> 00:24:03,824
(He heads there himself.)

613
00:24:03,824 --> 00:24:06,254
We can work on this again together. Don't worry.

614
00:24:08,524 --> 00:24:09,824
What's all this?

615
00:24:10,384 --> 00:24:11,424
(Is this solitary confinement?)

616
00:24:11,424 --> 00:24:13,624
No!

617
00:24:14,254 --> 00:24:15,654
(It's the best room ever.)

618
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:18,024
- What kind of room is this? - I have to leave if you come.

619
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,124
Leave.

620
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,284
Why didn't you take more time?

621
00:24:21,284 --> 00:24:22,284
(Haha is happy he came.)

622
00:24:23,584 --> 00:24:25,224
(He lost his power as the boss.)

623
00:24:25,224 --> 00:24:28,124
It's not like we'll be leaving any time soon.

624
00:24:28,284 --> 00:24:30,524
- Gosh. - You can start over.

625
00:24:30,924 --> 00:24:32,024
Are you out of your mind?

626
00:24:32,024 --> 00:24:34,354
(Seok Jin gets ready to act like a boss.)

627
00:24:34,354 --> 00:24:36,084
(Ready, )

628
00:24:36,084 --> 00:24:38,184
(set, go!)

629
00:24:38,184 --> 00:24:41,084
(The boss takes revenge.)

630
00:24:41,084 --> 00:24:43,724
What happened? Why did you do that?

631
00:24:43,724 --> 00:24:48,384
(Seok Jin takes it out on Jong Kook.)

632
00:24:48,884 --> 00:24:51,924
(Seok Jin is no longer the boss.)

633
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:53,354
Did you fall on your own?

634
00:24:53,354 --> 00:24:55,324
Come here now.

635
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:57,454
Have you lost your mind?

636
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,724
(Will this be the end of Seok Jin?)

637
00:25:00,284 --> 00:25:03,024
- Are you crazy? - Go to solitary confinement.

638
00:25:03,484 --> 00:25:04,624
Are you crazy?

639
00:25:04,624 --> 00:25:05,654
(Seok Jin tries to boss around.)

640
00:25:05,654 --> 00:25:08,024
You were the best target to push.

641
00:25:08,124 --> 00:25:09,724
I thought Jong Kook fell over on purpose.

642
00:25:09,724 --> 00:25:10,854
Open the door!

643
00:25:12,754 --> 00:25:14,024
(Jong Kook's counterattack will continue.)

644
00:25:14,024 --> 00:25:15,254
My goodness.

645
00:25:15,254 --> 00:25:17,124
I hope solitary confinement teaches him a lesson.

646
00:25:17,384 --> 00:25:19,654
No!

647
00:25:19,824 --> 00:25:21,984
What's that sound?

648
00:25:21,984 --> 00:25:25,124
It's quite difficult in solitary confinement.

649
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:26,554
What is it like?

650
00:25:26,624 --> 00:25:29,354
(Rumor has it, )

651
00:25:29,354 --> 00:25:31,554
(it's the most luxurious solitary confinement ever.)

652
00:25:31,554 --> 00:25:33,654
Seok Jin is over there alone.

653
00:25:33,654 --> 00:25:35,754
(He can't stop laughing.)

654
00:25:35,754 --> 00:25:38,084
(Jong Kook arrives.)

655
00:25:39,224 --> 00:25:41,024
(Solitary confinement makes them laugh.)

656
00:25:41,024 --> 00:25:42,754
What's this?

657
00:25:43,024 --> 00:25:44,524
Goodness.

658
00:25:44,754 --> 00:25:47,024
- What's going on here? - Get a foot massage.

659
00:25:47,024 --> 00:25:49,754
Shall I get a foot massage?

660
00:25:49,754 --> 00:25:53,454
(It's a prestigious place to rest for the top one percent.)

661
00:25:56,024 --> 00:25:57,524
I won't do it again.

662
00:25:59,754 --> 00:26:01,884
Everyone becomes obedient after being in solitary confinement.

663
00:26:01,884 --> 00:26:02,884
It's interesting.

664
00:26:02,884 --> 00:26:05,154
- What's in solitary confinement? - What is it?

665
00:26:08,584 --> 00:26:09,924
What is it like?

666
00:26:11,384 --> 00:26:13,124
(Thank you for sending me there.)

667
00:26:13,484 --> 00:26:15,824
- Go back there again. - No way.

668
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,624
(Go back there again.)

669
00:26:18,424 --> 00:26:20,254
- No! - He's being rude.

670
00:26:20,254 --> 00:26:21,254
(He tries not to laugh.)

671
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,824
No!

672
00:26:22,824 --> 00:26:25,554
(Seok Jin abuses his power.)

673
00:26:25,554 --> 00:26:26,824
Go back now.

674
00:26:26,824 --> 00:26:28,254
Don't use the card carelessly.

675
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,454
- Please don't send him. - Go back.

676
00:26:30,454 --> 00:26:32,524
(Seok Jin doesn't listen to anyone.)

677
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:33,884
You go back, too.

678
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,084
(Haha pours the beans on him.)

679
00:26:35,084 --> 00:26:36,154
You, go back.

680
00:26:36,624 --> 00:26:38,754
(Everyone wants to win the solitary confinement card.)

681
00:26:38,754 --> 00:26:40,624
(Everyone wants to go.)

682
00:26:40,624 --> 00:26:42,484
No, no.

683
00:26:42,484 --> 00:26:44,824
- You, too. - He sent me away, too.

684
00:26:44,824 --> 00:26:46,224
- No, please. - Go now.

685
00:26:46,224 --> 00:26:47,554
Forgive me this time.

686
00:26:47,554 --> 00:26:48,984
I won't forgive you.

687
00:26:49,124 --> 00:26:50,224
Go now.

688
00:26:50,654 --> 00:26:53,924
- He sent me there as well. - I can't believe them.

689
00:26:53,924 --> 00:26:55,624
How dare they?

690
00:26:55,624 --> 00:26:56,884
No!

691
00:26:58,124 --> 00:26:59,954
(He gets giddy.)

692
00:26:59,954 --> 00:27:00,984
(They love it here.)

693
00:27:00,984 --> 00:27:02,254
- What? - It's really delicious.

694
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:03,824
I bet he can't even imagine this.

695
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:04,854
No.

696
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,884
Only Ji Hyo hasn't been here.

697
00:27:06,884 --> 00:27:08,424
It's because she doesn't know.

698
00:27:08,424 --> 00:27:10,524
What is she doing?

699
00:27:11,124 --> 00:27:12,754
I should teach them a lesson.

700
00:27:12,754 --> 00:27:13,754
(Ji Hyo is working hard.)

701
00:27:13,754 --> 00:27:15,924
If I go, you'll be left here alone.

702
00:27:15,924 --> 00:27:18,024
- What? - If I go, you'll be here alone.

703
00:27:18,024 --> 00:27:19,724
When were you ever worried about that?

704
00:27:21,124 --> 00:27:22,484
I'll take the card out.

705
00:27:22,884 --> 00:27:25,024
(I need to calm down.)

706
00:27:29,724 --> 00:27:31,754
(Teasing)

707
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,084
(He adds oil to the fire.)

708
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:35,524
Stay still. Don't move.

709
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,354
I'm going to hit your cap.

710
00:27:40,354 --> 00:27:43,284
(My goodness!)

711
00:27:44,354 --> 00:27:45,854
I was being patient with you.

712
00:27:46,554 --> 00:27:49,954
- Hey. - Go ahead. Take the card out.

713
00:27:49,954 --> 00:27:51,784
(You don't have to explain.)

714
00:27:51,784 --> 00:27:52,984
She needs solitary confinement.

715
00:27:53,454 --> 00:27:55,324
- These punks. - Open the door.

716
00:27:55,324 --> 00:27:57,384
(He sends everybody away.)

717
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,754
These punks.

718
00:27:58,754 --> 00:28:02,254
(He is left alone.)

719
00:28:03,824 --> 00:28:05,024
Hold on.

720
00:28:05,824 --> 00:28:07,254
This is solitary confinement.

721
00:28:10,924 --> 00:28:13,354
(Welcome to our house!)

722
00:28:13,354 --> 00:28:14,984
- Start yelling, Ji Hyo. - You're finally here.

723
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,184
Start yelling.

724
00:28:16,524 --> 00:28:18,354
What's all this?

725
00:28:18,354 --> 00:28:19,654
- I'll give you some. - Take a tangerine.

726
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:22,254
Take some tangerine. The fried banana is really good.

727
00:28:22,584 --> 00:28:23,754
The strawberries are really good.

728
00:28:25,424 --> 00:28:33,024
(Gosh. I should have been nicer to them.)

729
00:28:33,024 --> 00:28:39,324
(I wonder what the other members are doing.)

730
00:28:39,324 --> 00:28:41,554
(It's paradise here.)

731
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:42,924
It's paradise here.

732
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:46,854
(She's happy to be in solitary confinement.)

733
00:28:46,854 --> 00:28:48,084
I understand now.

734
00:28:49,524 --> 00:28:51,654
(Siren)

735
00:28:52,284 --> 00:28:54,684
(What's this again?)

736
00:28:54,684 --> 00:28:55,924
What's that?

737
00:28:56,454 --> 00:28:57,554
(It's the meal time.)

738
00:28:57,684 --> 00:28:59,124
- Are we done here? - Are we done?

739
00:28:59,124 --> 00:29:00,924
You can continue tomorrow.

740
00:29:00,924 --> 00:29:02,584
- Yes. - Fine, finish tomorrow.

741
00:29:02,984 --> 00:29:04,824
- I'm hungry. - I'm so tired.

742
00:29:05,584 --> 00:29:07,754
I'm hungry. It's food.

743
00:29:08,524 --> 00:29:10,454
- It looks good. - It looks delicious.

744
00:29:10,454 --> 00:29:11,884
- This is my favorite. - It's pastry.

745
00:29:12,154 --> 00:29:13,684
- It looks good. - It looks delicious.

746
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:18,884
(Are we supposed to eat this?)
sbtitles ripped and synced by riri13

747
00:29:20,054 --> 00:29:24,254
(What about all the food we stuffed down our throats?)

748
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,624
- Bring it over here. - It's filled with whip cream.

749
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:29,184
- Bring it over here. - We'll give it to you after.

750
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,354
Bring it over here.

751
00:29:31,224 --> 00:29:33,084
(Looks delicious.)

752
00:29:33,084 --> 00:29:34,954
- You haven't had these, right? - Boss, I really want some.

753
00:29:34,954 --> 00:29:36,824
- I want some so much. - I'm very hungry.

754
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,054
Smell it.

755
00:29:38,054 --> 00:29:39,254
(You want some, right?)

756
00:29:40,584 --> 00:29:43,524
(Chuckling)

757
00:29:43,524 --> 00:29:44,754
(They crack up.)

758
00:29:44,754 --> 00:29:45,924
What?

759
00:29:46,354 --> 00:29:48,224
- Get out. - Get out.

760
00:29:48,224 --> 00:29:49,324
- Get back. - Get back.

761
00:29:49,324 --> 00:29:50,654
- What's wrong with you? - Are you out of your mind?

762
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:52,184
What's his problem?

763
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,024
- What's he doing? - Why is he laughing alone?

764
00:29:56,624 --> 00:29:58,124
(Smell it, Jae Seok.)

765
00:29:58,124 --> 00:30:00,184
It smells so good.

766
00:30:00,184 --> 00:30:02,124
You thought I was giving it to you, right?

767
00:30:02,124 --> 00:30:04,824
(Seok Jin faked it.)

768
00:30:04,824 --> 00:30:06,954
(Chuckling)

769
00:30:07,524 --> 00:30:09,224
What? What's wrong?

770
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,484
(Please stop.)

771
00:30:11,354 --> 00:30:12,424
Come here.

772
00:30:12,824 --> 00:30:13,954
My mouth is getting watery.

773
00:30:16,324 --> 00:30:17,554
- I almost had it. - Hey.

774
00:30:18,524 --> 00:30:22,624
(Jae Seok tries to trick him. He pretends like he's hungry.)

775
00:30:24,424 --> 00:30:25,554
What's wrong with him?

776
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:28,724
Even if you are hungry and want some food...

777
00:30:30,184 --> 00:30:33,424
(They all devour the food.)

778
00:30:34,224 --> 00:30:35,384
You guys.

779
00:30:35,384 --> 00:30:37,554
(They're in a state of anarchy.)

780
00:30:37,554 --> 00:30:39,884
(Kwang Soo targets the authority figure.)

781
00:30:39,884 --> 00:30:40,954
Hey.

782
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:43,484
(They all act like they're hungry.)

783
00:30:43,484 --> 00:30:44,884
Leave, Kwang Soo.

784
00:30:45,484 --> 00:30:46,754
Are you making me go again?

785
00:30:47,184 --> 00:30:48,854
- My gosh. - Go.

786
00:30:48,854 --> 00:30:50,284
Drop it in three.

787
00:30:50,284 --> 00:30:52,454
In 1, 2, 3.

788
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:53,784
Leave.

789
00:30:54,154 --> 00:30:56,684
- You can leave. - Eat before you leave.

790
00:30:57,754 --> 00:30:58,924
- Let me eat. - Follow them.

791
00:30:59,084 --> 00:31:00,224
I won't let you do that.

792
00:31:01,184 --> 00:31:02,624
(Whatever!)

793
00:31:02,624 --> 00:31:03,684
Come on.

794
00:31:04,224 --> 00:31:06,254
Let me eat.

795
00:31:06,254 --> 00:31:07,284
Give it back.

796
00:31:08,524 --> 00:31:11,754
(Seok Jin takes all the pastries away.)

797
00:31:12,884 --> 00:31:16,054
You kids. I feel so bad for you.

798
00:31:16,554 --> 00:31:19,084
(You shouldn't be.)

799
00:31:19,084 --> 00:31:20,524
Seok Jin was so funny.

800
00:31:20,954 --> 00:31:22,684
He asked if I wanted some.

801
00:31:24,224 --> 00:31:25,684
(He almost burped.)

802
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:27,984
We have so much food here so why would I want some?

803
00:31:27,984 --> 00:31:29,484
I'm too full to eat now.

804
00:31:30,684 --> 00:31:31,984
I'm too full.

805
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:35,854
(Seok Jin takes the food away from each person.)

806
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:37,384
It's really good.

807
00:31:37,384 --> 00:31:39,284
(Seok Jin takes the food away from each person.)

808
00:31:39,284 --> 00:31:41,024
(Smiling)

809
00:31:41,254 --> 00:31:43,284
Stop eating. Give it back.

810
00:31:43,724 --> 00:31:45,454
(He almost threw up from eating too much.)

811
00:31:46,624 --> 00:31:48,454
(Munching)

812
00:31:49,084 --> 00:31:50,754
- You should have let me eat. - Come here.

813
00:31:51,224 --> 00:31:52,454
I feel bad for you.

814
00:31:52,924 --> 00:31:55,584
(Here's some food.)

815
00:31:55,584 --> 00:31:57,484
- Eat it. - That's not fair.

816
00:31:57,984 --> 00:31:59,854
- You should eat. - Eat it.

817
00:31:59,954 --> 00:32:01,284
Finish it.

818
00:32:01,984 --> 00:32:04,424
- You worked hard. - It's from the boss. Finish it.

819
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:07,624
- Be thankful. - It's only for you, Jae Seok.

820
00:32:07,624 --> 00:32:09,624
Say, "Thank you for the food."

821
00:32:09,624 --> 00:32:11,484
Go ahead. Say it.

822
00:32:11,854 --> 00:32:13,124
- Thank you... - Eat it.

823
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,184
Hurry up and eat it.

824
00:32:16,254 --> 00:32:18,584
- Eat. - Thank you.

825
00:32:19,054 --> 00:32:20,854
I sent you to solitary confinement the most.

826
00:32:21,724 --> 00:32:23,124
- He did. - I'm sorry.

827
00:32:23,324 --> 00:32:24,484
- It's okay. - Eat.

828
00:32:24,754 --> 00:32:26,654
I'm starting to tear up. I'll stop eating.

829
00:32:26,854 --> 00:32:27,954
Eat.

830
00:32:28,024 --> 00:32:30,024
- Eat. - It's from the boss.

831
00:32:30,024 --> 00:32:32,424
(Don't try to play smart.)

832
00:32:34,154 --> 00:32:36,254
(Siren goes off.)

833
00:32:36,584 --> 00:32:38,354
What? I didn't get to eat and this is over already.

834
00:32:38,984 --> 00:32:40,024
Is it over?

835
00:32:40,724 --> 00:32:42,054
(The meal time is over. It's now time to exercise.)

836
00:32:42,124 --> 00:32:43,954
I don't usually exercise.

837
00:32:44,384 --> 00:32:46,424
What about this? We can play Statues.

838
00:32:46,724 --> 00:32:48,624
Person that loses heads to solitary confinement.

839
00:32:48,624 --> 00:32:52,954
(Person that loses will head to solitary confinement.)

840
00:32:53,924 --> 00:32:58,384
(All right. The loser heads straight to solitary confinement, right?)

841
00:32:59,954 --> 00:33:02,184
(Come to me.)

842
00:33:03,084 --> 00:33:04,354
If you lose, you're going to solitary confinement.

843
00:33:04,354 --> 00:33:05,784
- Yes. - What if you don't lose?

844
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:07,724
If there's no loser, I'll go there.

845
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:08,854
- Okay. - I'll go.

846
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:10,854
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

847
00:33:10,854 --> 00:33:12,284
- In 1, 2, 3. - We can do this.

848
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:13,454
Okay.

849
00:33:13,954 --> 00:33:20,054
(Let's make this look natural and proceed quickly.)

850
00:33:20,224 --> 00:33:21,454
- Make it quick. - Okay.

851
00:33:21,454 --> 00:33:22,524
Flowers are in full bloom.

852
00:33:22,524 --> 00:33:25,184
(Flowers are in full bloom.)

853
00:33:28,584 --> 00:33:29,624
Flowers are in full bloom.

854
00:33:29,684 --> 00:33:31,884
(Flowers are in full bloom.)

855
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:34,224
Flowers are in full bloom.

856
00:33:36,284 --> 00:33:39,254
(Falling)

857
00:33:40,324 --> 00:33:41,624
What was that for?

858
00:33:41,924 --> 00:33:43,284
- I'm sorry. - What was that?

859
00:33:43,284 --> 00:33:45,824
What was that for?

860
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,654
(Haha is going to solitary confinement.)

861
00:33:47,654 --> 00:33:49,154
- What was that? - No way.

862
00:33:49,154 --> 00:33:50,484
- No way. - Just go.

863
00:33:50,484 --> 00:33:51,924
(Why are you pretending like you're weak?)

864
00:33:51,924 --> 00:33:53,124
Come here.

865
00:33:53,554 --> 00:33:56,354
- You can't do that. - What was that?

866
00:33:56,354 --> 00:33:58,584
- You can't do that. - That was too easy.

867
00:33:58,584 --> 00:34:00,154
- Go. - Please.

868
00:34:00,154 --> 00:34:02,254
- Go. - Leave now.

869
00:34:02,254 --> 00:34:04,424
- No way. - You can't do that.

870
00:34:04,424 --> 00:34:06,054
- I saw him. - No.

871
00:34:06,054 --> 00:34:08,254
- That was too easy. - I saw it clearly.

872
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,624
- No. - You can't do that.

873
00:34:10,624 --> 00:34:12,254
(Seok Jin is happy he's not going and rest are sad they're not.)

874
00:34:13,854 --> 00:34:15,754
This is good. You can't talk back.

875
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,154
(They're ready for Round 2.)

876
00:34:17,154 --> 00:34:23,124
(We don't have time. There's not much space in solitary confinement.)

877
00:34:23,124 --> 00:34:24,984
You look like a leader.

878
00:34:25,154 --> 00:34:26,194
- I agree. - Flowers are in full bloom.

879
00:34:26,524 --> 00:34:28,424
(Halting)

880
00:34:29,024 --> 00:34:32,424
(She stops too late.)

881
00:34:32,424 --> 00:34:34,284
(Oh, dear.)

882
00:34:34,284 --> 00:34:36,194
- Ji Hyo. - Come on, Ji Hyo.

883
00:34:36,194 --> 00:34:37,554
What was that for?

884
00:34:37,554 --> 00:34:40,024
- Please, Seok Jin. - That looked natural.

885
00:34:40,124 --> 00:34:41,194
You're supposed to be better than this.

886
00:34:41,194 --> 00:34:42,354
You were better.

887
00:34:42,354 --> 00:34:43,984
- It wasn't me. - Come on, Ji Hyo.

888
00:34:44,694 --> 00:34:47,224
- Come on. - Hold on.

889
00:34:47,454 --> 00:34:49,154
He's being too intense.

890
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:51,084
- You guys are cute. - He's being too intense.

891
00:34:51,584 --> 00:34:54,084
- My goodness. - What are we supposed to do?

892
00:34:54,724 --> 00:34:55,854
(Haha and Ji Hyo are the lucky ones.)

893
00:34:55,854 --> 00:34:56,984
What happened?

894
00:34:56,984 --> 00:34:58,694
(Haha and Ji Hyo are the lucky ones.)

895
00:34:58,694 --> 00:34:59,724
Let's have some gimbap.

896
00:35:00,024 --> 00:35:01,694
It was so cold there.

897
00:35:01,854 --> 00:35:03,954
- They're... - They're trying to lose, right?

898
00:35:03,954 --> 00:35:05,484
They're all trying to lose.

899
00:35:06,724 --> 00:35:07,884
Let's go.

900
00:35:07,884 --> 00:35:09,884
(It's Round 3.)

901
00:35:09,884 --> 00:35:13,694
(It's a three way competition.)

902
00:35:14,054 --> 00:35:15,154
I think you're cute.

903
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,884
You're being so good and obedient today.

904
00:35:19,824 --> 00:35:20,854
Flowers are in full bloom.

905
00:35:21,224 --> 00:35:22,384
You're done.

906
00:35:22,384 --> 00:35:25,654
(It's the law of inertia.)

907
00:35:25,654 --> 00:35:27,054
(Dashing)

908
00:35:27,054 --> 00:35:28,424
- Hold on. - No way.

909
00:35:28,424 --> 00:35:30,584
- You can't. - That wasn't it.

910
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:31,694
That was too weird.

911
00:35:31,694 --> 00:35:33,554
- Let's go again. - That was fake.

912
00:35:33,754 --> 00:35:35,484
- You saw it, right? - No way.

913
00:35:35,724 --> 00:35:37,824
I was going too fast that I couldn't stop.

914
00:35:37,924 --> 00:35:39,524
- But still... - This is filmed.

915
00:35:39,524 --> 00:35:41,124
- Let's go again. - That's too much.

916
00:35:41,124 --> 00:35:43,954
- I can't let it go. - That looked too fake.

917
00:35:43,954 --> 00:35:45,624
Go. Hurry.

918
00:35:45,984 --> 00:35:47,984
That wasn't good.

919
00:35:47,984 --> 00:35:50,324
(Jae Seok is the third person to leave for solitary confinement.)

920
00:35:51,254 --> 00:35:52,784
(Welcome, my friend.)

921
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:55,284
What was that for, Ji Hyo?

922
00:35:55,824 --> 00:35:57,884
- Jae Seok. - That was too obvious.

923
00:35:57,884 --> 00:36:01,224
- That was too fake, Haha. - Come on.

924
00:36:01,224 --> 00:36:02,924
What was I supposed to do then?

925
00:36:03,924 --> 00:36:06,754
(It's final round.)

926
00:36:06,754 --> 00:36:09,454
(I must lose.)

927
00:36:10,694 --> 00:36:11,954
- Flowers are in full bloom. - Ouch.

928
00:36:11,954 --> 00:36:13,124
(Lying down)

929
00:36:14,554 --> 00:36:15,924
You were worse.

930
00:36:15,984 --> 00:36:17,194
(Jong Kook is out.)

931
00:36:17,724 --> 00:36:19,954
- I can't go now? - You can't. Stay here.

932
00:36:20,084 --> 00:36:22,524
(Everyone but Kwang Soo heads to solitary confinement.)

933
00:36:22,524 --> 00:36:23,924
- I'm sorry. - Don't be.

934
00:36:25,854 --> 00:36:27,954
Give me some gimbap. Let me have some.

935
00:36:27,954 --> 00:36:29,484
I almost didn't make it.

936
00:36:29,484 --> 00:36:30,524
Jae Seok.

937
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:33,194
- What? - I almost didn't make it.

938
00:36:33,194 --> 00:36:34,384
- What is that? - There's something in here.

939
00:36:34,384 --> 00:36:36,154
(Why is there a map in gimbap?)

940
00:36:36,884 --> 00:36:38,084
(What's this?)

941
00:36:38,084 --> 00:36:39,424
- There's something in here. - What's that?

942
00:36:39,924 --> 00:36:41,054
It must be an escape route.

943
00:36:41,084 --> 00:36:42,624
(My gosh!)

944
00:36:43,054 --> 00:36:46,624
(They found a map of the prison.)

945
00:36:47,284 --> 00:36:49,694
There's a 3rd room on the 3rd floor. What's this?

946
00:36:49,694 --> 00:36:53,424
(Is this about escaping the prison now?)

947
00:36:53,424 --> 00:36:54,454
Is the clue just one?

948
00:36:54,654 --> 00:36:56,524
So this was about escaping.

949
00:36:56,654 --> 00:36:58,624
- It's an escape game. - It is.

950
00:36:58,624 --> 00:37:02,624
(That was something unexpected. Would they manage to escape?)

951
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:06,324
(Everybody is enjoying their time in prison.)

952
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:07,454
People...

953
00:37:07,454 --> 00:37:08,924
(Attention, prisoners.)

954
00:37:08,924 --> 00:37:10,654
- People? - Convicts.

955
00:37:10,924 --> 00:37:12,254
You have mail.

956
00:37:12,254 --> 00:37:14,224
- Mail? - Mail?

957
00:37:14,224 --> 00:37:16,824
(Is it mail from the outside world?)

958
00:37:16,824 --> 00:37:18,454
- Who is it for? - Who sent it?

959
00:37:18,554 --> 00:37:20,854
- Is it for me? - It must be from your girlfriend.

960
00:37:20,854 --> 00:37:22,224
To the guy who falls in love quickly?

961
00:37:23,194 --> 00:37:24,584
(What is this?)

962
00:37:24,584 --> 00:37:26,384
- It must be for you. - It says so here.

963
00:37:26,384 --> 00:37:27,854
He dropped something.

964
00:37:27,854 --> 00:37:28,954
Seok Jin.

965
00:37:28,954 --> 00:37:30,524
(Jae Seok finds a mysterious piece of paper.)

966
00:37:30,554 --> 00:37:32,054
(Let's share the information.)

967
00:37:32,324 --> 00:37:34,254
- Let me see. - He dropped it.

968
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:36,584
- He dropped it. - "From 3pm..."

969
00:37:36,584 --> 00:37:37,924
(It must be something important.)

970
00:37:38,024 --> 00:37:40,754
- What is it? - "Electrical equipment inspection"?

971
00:37:40,784 --> 00:37:42,554
(It will take about 10 minutes from 3pm.)

972
00:37:43,354 --> 00:37:46,054
(Wait.)

973
00:37:46,054 --> 00:37:50,854
(It means the guard will be away for 10 minutes from 3pm.)

974
00:37:54,554 --> 00:37:56,924
- It's a letter from my mom. - Really?

975
00:37:58,124 --> 00:38:00,024
"Dear my son who falls in love quickly..."

976
00:38:00,784 --> 00:38:01,984
(It should be Kwang Soo's official nickname.)

977
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,024
Don't do this.

978
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:06,854
- Keep reading. - You're hopelessly romantic.

979
00:38:06,854 --> 00:38:09,854
"Dear my hopelessly romantic son, Kwang Soo."

980
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:12,524
"Are you doing well? It's been cold these days."

981
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:15,384
"I wonder who you fell in love with there."

982
00:38:15,384 --> 00:38:17,824
"You've been always full of love."

983
00:38:18,024 --> 00:38:22,054
"I'm so proud that you're hopelessly romantic. I love you, my son."

984
00:38:22,054 --> 00:38:24,384
- "From your mom." - Mom.

985
00:38:24,454 --> 00:38:27,354
- I'm sorry. - We should write a song about him.

986
00:38:28,054 --> 00:38:31,084
Guys, a wedding invitation just arrived.

987
00:38:31,084 --> 00:38:32,694
- What's that? - A wedding invitation?

988
00:38:32,694 --> 00:38:33,754
(A wedding invitation?)

989
00:38:33,754 --> 00:38:36,284
- A wedding invitation? - It's related to the wedding hall.

990
00:38:36,284 --> 00:38:37,754
(They went to a wedding hall before being sent to here.)

991
00:38:37,754 --> 00:38:41,254
- It's related to the wedding hall. - It is.

992
00:38:41,254 --> 00:38:42,254
Is he taking us...

993
00:38:42,254 --> 00:38:45,954
"Attend Seok Jin's wedding with all the other members."

994
00:38:45,954 --> 00:38:50,454
"If you don't arrive at the wedding hall on time, you'll be penalized."

995
00:38:50,854 --> 00:38:54,054
January 16 is today. What time?

996
00:38:54,884 --> 00:38:56,784
"Jee Seok Jin and Ryu Soo Jeong"?

997
00:38:57,754 --> 00:38:59,554
Ryu Soo Jeong? That's my wife's name.

998
00:39:00,124 --> 00:39:04,324
(Will Seok Jin's bride be at the wedding hall?)

999
00:39:04,924 --> 00:39:08,024
(If they don't arrive there by 5pm, the bride will disappear.)

1000
00:39:08,024 --> 00:39:12,924
(My groom, please escape there.)

1001
00:39:12,924 --> 00:39:13,954
Ryu Soo Jeong?

1002
00:39:13,954 --> 00:39:16,984
(Could the map be...)

1003
00:39:17,784 --> 00:39:19,224
What time is it now?

1004
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:21,224
I think we're supposed to escape using this map.

1005
00:39:21,584 --> 00:39:24,524
We found a map earlier.

1006
00:39:24,524 --> 00:39:26,324
We found a map.

1007
00:39:26,424 --> 00:39:28,484
- Where? - At the solitary confinement.

1008
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,324
At the solitary confinement.

1009
00:39:30,324 --> 00:39:32,694
(The solitary confinement, 20 minutes earlier)

1010
00:39:33,324 --> 00:39:36,724
(They found a map on the wrapping paper by accident.)

1011
00:39:36,724 --> 00:39:37,854
- What's that? - There's something on the paper.

1012
00:39:38,754 --> 00:39:40,024
I think we're supposed to escape here.

1013
00:39:41,654 --> 00:39:44,224
(High and sturdy iron walls)

1014
00:39:44,224 --> 00:39:45,784
(Locked iron bars)

1015
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:47,954
(Passages full of mines)

1016
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:50,224
(Rappelling facilities)

1017
00:39:51,194 --> 00:39:54,224
(We're supposed to escape here.)

1018
00:39:54,584 --> 00:39:56,054
At the solitary confinement?

1019
00:39:56,254 --> 00:39:59,154
We went through so much at the solitary confinement.

1020
00:39:59,154 --> 00:40:00,754
We had to complete missions.

1021
00:40:00,754 --> 00:40:02,754
We had to complete missions to acquire this.

1022
00:40:02,754 --> 00:40:04,424
- Really? - Yes.

1023
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,284
We had to roll on the ice.

1024
00:40:06,284 --> 00:40:08,724
Guys, there's no boss anymore.

1025
00:40:08,724 --> 00:40:10,324
- We're one now. - We are.

1026
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,784
If we don't arrive at the wedding hall by 5pm,

1027
00:40:12,784 --> 00:40:14,724
we'll all be penalized.

1028
00:40:14,724 --> 00:40:16,484
- Do you understand? - We're one.

1029
00:40:16,524 --> 00:40:18,694
- For your wedding. - One, two, three.

1030
00:40:18,694 --> 00:40:19,984
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

1031
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,324
(The prison break starts.)

1032
00:40:24,124 --> 00:40:26,384
(The game is on.)

1033
00:40:26,384 --> 00:40:28,754
(Aim for the 10 minutes when the guards are away.)

1034
00:40:28,754 --> 00:40:32,554
(They must pass the four obstacles on the map to get out.)

1035
00:40:32,554 --> 00:40:36,124
(They need to be at the wedding by 5pm for Seok Jin to meet his bride.)

1036
00:40:36,124 --> 00:40:39,054
(The prisoners' escape starts.)

1037
00:40:39,054 --> 00:40:43,194
(What will happen to them?)

1038
00:40:43,424 --> 00:40:46,694
(Prison Break)

1039
00:40:46,724 --> 00:40:48,484
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1040
00:40:48,484 --> 00:40:49,784
We can't go now.

1041
00:40:50,624 --> 00:40:52,424
Shouldn't the lights be off?

1042
00:40:52,424 --> 00:40:53,554
They're not here.

1043
00:40:53,554 --> 00:40:56,354
- There's an equipment inspection. - We have only 10 minutes.

1044
00:40:57,024 --> 00:41:00,194
(What is waiting behind that door?)

1045
00:41:00,194 --> 00:41:02,324
- The door should open. - The guards are away.

1046
00:41:02,324 --> 00:41:04,694
- Where's everybody? - The door should open.

1047
00:41:04,694 --> 00:41:06,254
Where's everybody?

1048
00:41:07,124 --> 00:41:08,354
The door should open.

1049
00:41:08,354 --> 00:41:10,654
- Where's everybody? - Where's everybody?

1050
00:41:10,654 --> 00:41:13,284
- This is the solitary confinement. - Let me see.

1051
00:41:13,524 --> 00:41:16,224
- What's this? - Didn't you know?

1052
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,284
(What is this luxurious room?)

1053
00:41:18,554 --> 00:41:21,954
- I'm sorry. - Here is where we were confined.

1054
00:41:21,954 --> 00:41:24,484
(You guys deceived me.)

1055
00:41:25,454 --> 00:41:28,524
(He sent them to the solitary confinement.)

1056
00:41:28,524 --> 00:41:32,824
(They had a luxury time in the solitary confinement.)

1057
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:36,124
(The man in power had no idea.)

1058
00:41:36,224 --> 00:41:39,154
(He became a victim.)

1059
00:41:39,154 --> 00:41:41,224
(Is this what I became the boss for?)

1060
00:41:41,554 --> 00:41:44,084
- Were you guys here? - Let's take some candies.

1061
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,524
- Let's take candies. - What's on the other side?

1062
00:41:45,524 --> 00:41:48,024
- Were you eating these? - Let's hurry.

1063
00:41:48,354 --> 00:41:50,724
- Let's go. - This is no time for this.

1064
00:41:50,724 --> 00:41:52,524
- What is this? - We don't have much time.

1065
00:41:52,524 --> 00:41:54,454
Are we supposed to get through this within three minutes?

1066
00:41:54,454 --> 00:41:56,054
To the opposite door?

1067
00:41:56,054 --> 00:41:57,454
(It's impenetrable.)

1068
00:41:58,454 --> 00:42:02,054
(They need to get through this door to get to the next route.)

1069
00:42:02,054 --> 00:42:03,324
What are we supposed to do?

1070
00:42:04,084 --> 00:42:05,924
- I don't understand. - Is there more?

1071
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:07,824
Are we supposed to go over the wall?

1072
00:42:07,824 --> 00:42:08,884
(There must be something more.)

1073
00:42:08,884 --> 00:42:11,324
- We can probably break this. - Break it.

1074
00:42:11,324 --> 00:42:12,754
(This side doesn't look that sturdy.)

1075
00:42:12,754 --> 00:42:14,084
- Break it. - Hurry.

1076
00:42:14,084 --> 00:42:16,084
(It's open.)

1077
00:42:16,324 --> 00:42:18,054
Are we supposed to go through this?

1078
00:42:18,054 --> 00:42:21,084
- Go through it. - I'll go first.

1079
00:42:21,084 --> 00:42:22,954
- Go through it. - One, two, three.

1080
00:42:23,354 --> 00:42:25,824
- There's one at the bottom, too. - Where? Oh, I found it.

1081
00:42:26,124 --> 00:42:28,124
- There's one at the bottom. - Hurry.

1082
00:42:28,124 --> 00:42:29,924
- Wait. - Ji Hyo, go.

1083
00:42:29,924 --> 00:42:31,854
Open the door.

1084
00:42:31,854 --> 00:42:33,154
Can you open the door?

1085
00:42:33,154 --> 00:42:34,854
- Can you open the door? - Open it.

1086
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:37,284
There you go.

1087
00:42:37,284 --> 00:42:39,084
(Doors, be opened.)

1088
00:42:39,084 --> 00:42:40,454
There's no key.

1089
00:42:40,454 --> 00:42:42,154
- Hurry. - We need to go through here.

1090
00:42:42,154 --> 00:42:43,984
- There is. - Did you find it?

1091
00:42:43,984 --> 00:42:46,084
- There is. - Where should I go?

1092
00:42:46,324 --> 00:42:48,194
- Kwang Soo, come here. - What should I do?

1093
00:42:48,194 --> 00:42:49,524
Come down.

1094
00:42:49,524 --> 00:42:50,954
- Come down here. - Should I?

1095
00:42:50,954 --> 00:42:52,484
- Kwang Soo, come down. - Let's go.

1096
00:42:52,824 --> 00:42:55,554
(They passed the 1st course with 3 minutes remaining.)

1097
00:42:55,554 --> 00:42:56,584
Come down.

1098
00:42:57,194 --> 00:42:59,454
- What's that? - It's on the map.

1099
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:01,954
- It's not that way. - Come here.

1100
00:43:02,024 --> 00:43:03,754
We probably need to find the password.

1101
00:43:03,854 --> 00:43:05,884
- Seok Jin, - What is the password?

1102
00:43:05,884 --> 00:43:08,524
- when is your wife's birthday? - Could it be our anniversary?

1103
00:43:08,524 --> 00:43:10,224
- When is your anniversary? - When is it?

1104
00:43:10,224 --> 00:43:11,854
- Try 1031. - Try 7012.

1105
00:43:11,854 --> 00:43:13,354
- Try 1031. - Try 1031.

1106
00:43:13,354 --> 00:43:16,124
(They try her birthday first.)

1107
00:43:16,124 --> 00:43:17,524
Try 1031.

1108
00:43:17,654 --> 00:43:20,384
- It doesn't work. - Try 7012.

1109
00:43:20,924 --> 00:43:23,354
- Are there any clues? - Is there nothing?

1110
00:43:23,354 --> 00:43:24,424
(They try 7012 next.)

1111
00:43:24,424 --> 00:43:26,954
- Are there any clues? - It doesn't work.

1112
00:43:28,324 --> 00:43:30,584
It says, "Race Starter".

1113
00:43:31,124 --> 00:43:32,284
It means Seok Jin.

1114
00:43:32,284 --> 00:43:33,924
- It says, "Race Starter". - Try his phone number.

1115
00:43:33,924 --> 00:43:35,024
Where?

1116
00:43:35,284 --> 00:43:36,884
- That's you. - It says "Race Starter" here.

1117
00:43:36,884 --> 00:43:38,154
Race Starter?

1118
00:43:38,154 --> 00:43:40,194
(Race Starter is Seok Jin's nickname.)

1119
00:43:40,194 --> 00:43:42,584
(Does Seok Jin have the password with him?)

1120
00:43:42,584 --> 00:43:43,654
When is your birthday?

1121
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:46,354
Try 0210.

1122
00:43:46,654 --> 00:43:49,284
- What if they start chasing us? - Is that the right way?

1123
00:43:49,584 --> 00:43:53,284
- Race Starter is Seok Jin. - Isn't this how you do it?

1124
00:43:53,284 --> 00:43:55,254
What if they start chasing us?

1125
00:43:55,254 --> 00:43:56,624
Is this the right way?

1126
00:43:56,624 --> 00:43:58,354
(What is this ominous feeling?)

1127
00:43:58,354 --> 00:44:01,224
(It's 3:10pm. The inspection is over.)

1128
00:44:01,224 --> 00:44:03,784
(The prisoners are attempting to escape.)

1129
00:44:03,784 --> 00:44:06,024
(Arrest them immediately.)

1130
00:44:06,524 --> 00:44:09,124
- Don't you have to push something? - Isn't it right?

1131
00:44:09,124 --> 00:44:11,224
- What could Race Starter mean? - Race Starter.

1132
00:44:11,224 --> 00:44:13,024
What could it mean?

1133
00:44:13,024 --> 00:44:14,984
(What could the code mean?)

1134
00:44:14,984 --> 00:44:17,684
- He needs to be out. - It's not right.

1135
00:44:17,854 --> 00:44:19,024
- Out? - He's usually the first to be out.

1136
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:22,824
(Let's look back on the history.)

1137
00:44:23,124 --> 00:44:24,654
(The name tag is ripped off.)

1138
00:44:24,654 --> 00:44:29,554
(Seok Jin always started the race by getting eliminated first.)

1139
00:44:30,354 --> 00:44:35,354
(The race starts when Seok Jin gets eliminated.)

1140
00:44:36,154 --> 00:44:40,424
(Wait. Could there be something under Seok Jin's name tag?)

1141
00:44:42,184 --> 00:44:44,154
(The name tag is ripped off.)

1142
00:44:44,154 --> 00:44:45,784
- It's here. - Is there something?

1143
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,954
(They found a hint.)

1144
00:44:48,954 --> 00:44:51,524
"The year Seok Jin debuted as a singer".

1145
00:44:51,524 --> 00:44:54,284
"The year Seok Jin passed the comedian exam".

1146
00:44:54,284 --> 00:44:58,224
(It's a summary of Seok Jin's life history.)

1147
00:44:58,484 --> 00:45:00,984
"The year Seok Jin passed the comedian exam". Tell us.

1148
00:45:00,984 --> 00:45:03,554
- It's 1992. - It's 1992.

1149
00:45:03,554 --> 00:45:05,524
- It was there. - Hurry.

1150
00:45:05,524 --> 00:45:06,654
You're amazing.

1151
00:45:06,654 --> 00:45:09,154
Add them up. "The year Seok Jin debuted as a singer".

1152
00:45:09,154 --> 00:45:10,454
"The year Seok Jin passed the comedian exam".

1153
00:45:10,454 --> 00:45:12,284
- Do it one by one. - When did you debut?

1154
00:45:12,284 --> 00:45:14,654
- I debuted in 1993. - Is it 1992?

1155
00:45:14,654 --> 00:45:15,854
- Is it 1993? - Right.

1156
00:45:15,854 --> 00:45:16,924
Remember it.

1157
00:45:16,924 --> 00:45:19,484
- Add 1992... - It's 1992 plus 1993.

1158
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:22,524
- It's hard. - Does anyone have a pen?

1159
00:45:22,784 --> 00:45:25,284
(Where are the prisoners?)

1160
00:45:25,284 --> 00:45:26,984
(Motivated)

1161
00:45:27,254 --> 00:45:29,424
- How are we going to do this? - Let's hurry.

1162
00:45:29,424 --> 00:45:31,524
- When did you debut as a singer? - In 1992.

1163
00:45:31,524 --> 00:45:34,584
- And? - As a comedian in 1993.

1164
00:45:34,654 --> 00:45:37,524
- Okay. - As a host in 1994.

1165
00:45:37,554 --> 00:45:39,884
- Is it 1994? - Yes.

1166
00:45:40,054 --> 00:45:41,384
It's so hard.

1167
00:45:41,584 --> 00:45:44,884
- Let's hurry. - Hurry.

1168
00:45:44,884 --> 00:45:46,324
Let's add them together.

1169
00:45:46,324 --> 00:45:47,724
Each person should remember one number.

1170
00:45:47,724 --> 00:45:51,824
Let's multiply 2000 by 4 and subtract the numbers.

1171
00:45:51,824 --> 00:45:53,184
Add 8, 7, 7, and 6 together.

1172
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:55,084
- Add them together. - Add 8, 7, 7, and 6 together?

1173
00:45:55,084 --> 00:45:56,754
Try 7973.

1174
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:01,484
(If they fail this time, they won't be able to escape.)

1175
00:46:02,654 --> 00:46:03,654
(It's open.)

1176
00:46:03,654 --> 00:46:05,584
- Okay. - Hurry.

1177
00:46:05,584 --> 00:46:07,684
(It's 3:25pm. They passed the 2nd obstacle.)

1178
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:10,524
- Hurry. - Go up.

1179
00:46:10,524 --> 00:46:12,354
- Go up. - Go up.

1180
00:46:12,354 --> 00:46:13,724
(Move towards the 3rd course.)

1181
00:46:15,554 --> 00:46:16,624
- What is this? - What is this?

1182
00:46:16,624 --> 00:46:17,654
I know what it is.

1183
00:46:17,654 --> 00:46:19,224
(What's ahead of them?)

1184
00:46:19,224 --> 00:46:20,754
You should step on the right spots.

1185
00:46:21,924 --> 00:46:24,484
(Find the right way.)

1186
00:46:25,384 --> 00:46:27,254
(They have to start again if they step on a mine.)

1187
00:46:27,324 --> 00:46:29,154
There's a monitor.

1188
00:46:30,784 --> 00:46:32,354
That must be the right path.

1189
00:46:32,354 --> 00:46:35,124
- We have to remember it. - I'll remember the last part.

1190
00:46:35,354 --> 00:46:36,754
Three...

1191
00:46:36,754 --> 00:46:38,324
- It's easy. - Three, three, two, one...

1192
00:46:38,324 --> 00:46:40,084
- It's easy. - Two, two...

1193
00:46:40,084 --> 00:46:42,084
- Three, three... - I memorized it.

1194
00:46:42,084 --> 00:46:43,984
- If you memorized it, start. - Go.

1195
00:46:43,984 --> 00:46:47,384
- Here... - The guards are following.

1196
00:46:47,384 --> 00:46:49,584
- The guards are following. - Two, two...

1197
00:46:49,654 --> 00:46:52,654
- Three, three, two... - They're almost here.

1198
00:46:52,654 --> 00:46:54,884
(We'll catch them by all means.)

1199
00:46:54,884 --> 00:46:56,384
- Two... - Here?

1200
00:46:56,384 --> 00:46:57,424
Two...

1201
00:46:58,324 --> 00:46:59,724
(He tripped.)

1202
00:46:59,724 --> 00:47:01,424
What happened?

1203
00:47:01,424 --> 00:47:03,624
(They can continue because he didn't step on it properly.)

1204
00:47:03,624 --> 00:47:05,454
- There. - That way.

1205
00:47:05,454 --> 00:47:07,224
(They will get caught if they make a mistake.)

1206
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,854
(Will they get caught or will they escape?)

1207
00:47:09,924 --> 00:47:12,024
- It's that way. - It's that one.

1208
00:47:12,024 --> 00:47:14,684
- There. - It's here.

1209
00:47:14,684 --> 00:47:15,824
(They are all so loud.)

1210
00:47:15,824 --> 00:47:17,154
- It's here. - It's here.

1211
00:47:17,184 --> 00:47:18,354
(They're so close.)

1212
00:47:18,354 --> 00:47:20,524
- It's this way. - It's over here.

1213
00:47:20,524 --> 00:47:22,084
(They pass the 3rd obstacle.)

1214
00:47:22,084 --> 00:47:26,254
(The current time is 3:30pm. They have 90 minutes left.)

1215
00:47:26,254 --> 00:47:28,224
(One last obstacle remains.)

1216
00:47:28,284 --> 00:47:30,124
- There's a game. - It's right behind you.

1217
00:47:30,124 --> 00:47:31,624
- Is this it? - What is it?

1218
00:47:31,924 --> 00:47:33,984
- Do we have to go outside? - What is this?

1219
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:35,924
- What is this? - Have they lost their mind?

1220
00:47:35,924 --> 00:47:39,084
- No way. - This is impossible.

1221
00:47:39,084 --> 00:47:42,154
- This can't be true. - We can't do it.

1222
00:47:42,154 --> 00:47:43,654
(What's the last obstacle?)

1223
00:47:43,654 --> 00:47:46,524
- I don't like it. - How could they make us do it?

1224
00:47:46,524 --> 00:47:48,654
(Is it your 1st time falling from the 3rd floor?)

1225
00:47:48,654 --> 00:47:51,154
- Let's just do it. - Seriously?

1226
00:47:51,154 --> 00:47:52,454
(Here's the story behind the obstacle.)

1227
00:47:52,454 --> 00:47:54,724
- What else can we do? - My goodness.

1228
00:47:55,724 --> 00:47:58,384
I'd like to challenge myself to something I couldn't do before.

1229
00:47:58,384 --> 00:47:59,954
I'd like to challenge myself.

1230
00:47:59,954 --> 00:48:03,324
If I make it, it would be very rewarding.

1231
00:48:04,054 --> 00:48:05,724
I'll feel proud of myself.

1232
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:07,284
How can we do this?

1233
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:10,824
(We prepared something he's never done before.)

1234
00:48:10,824 --> 00:48:12,754
(How can they do it?)

1235
00:48:12,754 --> 00:48:15,084
(Many of them are afraid of heights.)

1236
00:48:15,084 --> 00:48:17,954
- Are they being serious? - How could they make us do it?

1237
00:48:17,954 --> 00:48:19,254
Let's put this on.

1238
00:48:19,254 --> 00:48:20,754
(Haha can't believe it.)

1239
00:48:20,754 --> 00:48:22,884
- What else can we do? - My goodness.

1240
00:48:22,884 --> 00:48:24,154
Do we have to do it for real?

1241
00:48:25,084 --> 00:48:27,024
- Are you being serious? - Gosh.

1242
00:48:27,024 --> 00:48:28,824
(Yes, we're being serious.)

1243
00:48:29,154 --> 00:48:31,584
- How? - Let's just go back to prison.

1244
00:48:31,884 --> 00:48:33,424
This is unbelievable.

1245
00:48:33,424 --> 00:48:35,054
(Welcome to the last stage of Seok Jin's Prison.)

1246
00:48:35,054 --> 00:48:36,624
- How can we do it? - Is this it?

1247
00:48:36,624 --> 00:48:40,484
We have professional help for our escape,

1248
00:48:40,554 --> 00:48:42,584
- so don't worry too much. - Right.

1249
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:44,224
Staying in solitary confinement wasn't bad.

1250
00:48:44,224 --> 00:48:45,684
Can you do it, Ji Hyo?

1251
00:48:45,754 --> 00:48:47,924
- I'll do it first. - You go first.

1252
00:48:48,024 --> 00:48:50,724
- She can do it. - She's the bravest one.

1253
00:48:50,724 --> 00:48:52,084
(She's reliable.)

1254
00:48:52,084 --> 00:48:53,784
Ji Hyo is the bravest one of all.

1255
00:48:53,854 --> 00:48:54,984
Go ahead, Ji Hyo.

1256
00:48:54,984 --> 00:48:56,754
- I trust you, Ji Hyo. - Okay.

1257
00:48:56,754 --> 00:48:58,954
This place is too dangerous. You should escape first.

1258
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:00,954
(Kwang Soo lets Ji Hyo go first.)

1259
00:49:00,954 --> 00:49:04,384
Jump off, Ji Hyo. Someone's coming after us.

1260
00:49:04,384 --> 00:49:06,124
- It's not too high. - Can you do it alone?

1261
00:49:06,284 --> 00:49:09,084
(The first to escape is Ji Hyo.)

1262
00:49:09,084 --> 00:49:10,254
(It's frightening.)

1263
00:49:10,254 --> 00:49:11,724
Turn around, Ji Hyo.

1264
00:49:11,724 --> 00:49:13,454
- Tell us if you can't do it. - I can't do it.

1265
00:49:13,454 --> 00:49:15,554
I don't think we'll make it to my wedding.

1266
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:18,054
- Be careful. - Hold the rope tightly.

1267
00:49:18,054 --> 00:49:19,054
(She knows what to do.)

1268
00:49:19,054 --> 00:49:21,084
- Like this? - She's doing it all alone.

1269
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:22,754
(She's not afraid at all.)

1270
00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:25,224
(With cowardly members behind, )

1271
00:49:25,224 --> 00:49:28,254
(she attempts to escape without any hesitation.)

1272
00:49:28,254 --> 00:49:31,254
- Am I good to go? - Here you go.

1273
00:49:31,254 --> 00:49:32,754
(The prison break starts.)

1274
00:49:32,754 --> 00:49:34,924
- Hold onto this, Ji Hyo. - Be careful.

1275
00:49:34,924 --> 00:49:36,954
(All 6 members must escape within 1 hour.)

1276
00:49:36,954 --> 00:49:41,524
(Will all members escape successfully?)

1277
00:49:42,284 --> 00:49:44,654
- Like this? - She's doing it all alone.

1278
00:49:44,654 --> 00:49:47,524
(She descends with stability and composure.)

1279
00:49:47,524 --> 00:49:49,884
- Hold onto this, Ji Hyo. - Be careful.

1280
00:49:49,884 --> 00:49:51,454
- Am I set to go? - You're doing well.

1281
00:49:51,454 --> 00:49:54,054
You're good enough to descend alone.

1282
00:49:54,824 --> 00:49:56,824
- Am I set to go? - You're fine.

1283
00:49:56,824 --> 00:49:58,524
(She descends...)

1284
00:49:58,524 --> 00:50:00,124
(step by step.)

1285
00:50:00,124 --> 00:50:02,024
- You'll be fine. - Am I set to go?

1286
00:50:02,024 --> 00:50:03,954
We should be more worried about ourselves.

1287
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,754
- She's almost there. - You got it.

1288
00:50:05,754 --> 00:50:06,924
(She descends lightly.)

1289
00:50:06,924 --> 00:50:08,154
Ji Hyo is very good.

1290
00:50:08,154 --> 00:50:09,624
She's talented.

1291
00:50:09,624 --> 00:50:11,054
(It's a piece of cake.)

1292
00:50:11,054 --> 00:50:13,054
- See? - She's good.

1293
00:50:13,284 --> 00:50:14,954
- She's very good. - Guys.

1294
00:50:14,954 --> 00:50:16,984
It's okay. It's not scary.

1295
00:50:16,984 --> 00:50:18,884
It isn't scary for you.

1296
00:50:18,884 --> 00:50:20,154
(Ji Hyo fears nothing.)

1297
00:50:20,154 --> 00:50:21,984
I'm scared just by watching it.

1298
00:50:22,654 --> 00:50:24,124
(She descends safely.)

1299
00:50:24,124 --> 00:50:26,654
- I'm so jealous of her. - She made it. It's our turn.

1300
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:28,954
(She escapes successfully.)

1301
00:50:28,954 --> 00:50:30,784
- Did she get to the ground? - Who wants to go next?

1302
00:50:31,054 --> 00:50:33,284
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1303
00:50:33,284 --> 00:50:35,284
(They play rock-paper-scissors to determine the order.)

1304
00:50:35,284 --> 00:50:36,454
- Boss. - Let's hurry.

1305
00:50:36,454 --> 00:50:38,284
Even if we get caught, you should escape.

1306
00:50:38,454 --> 00:50:40,454
- Please go ahead. - I'll go last.

1307
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,824
(He gets special treatment.)

1308
00:50:41,824 --> 00:50:44,124
(Who will go next?)

1309
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,084
(Kwang Soo loses.)

1310
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:49,354
(Unlucky Kwang Soo is selected.)

1311
00:50:49,724 --> 00:50:50,784
Kwang Soo.

1312
00:50:51,154 --> 00:50:54,054
(The sky expresses pity for Kwang Soo.)

1313
00:50:56,184 --> 00:50:57,584
Goodness.

1314
00:50:57,584 --> 00:50:59,454
(He doesn't understand why they're doing this.)

1315
00:50:59,454 --> 00:51:02,784
It's not a real prison break, so what's the fuss about?

1316
00:51:03,384 --> 00:51:05,124
(Right now, )

1317
00:51:05,124 --> 00:51:07,724
(the guards are coming after them.)

1318
00:51:07,924 --> 00:51:09,454
- Let's hurry. - Go now.

1319
00:51:09,454 --> 00:51:11,584
- Hurry up. - Shut your mouth.

1320
00:51:11,654 --> 00:51:13,524
Go up now.

1321
00:51:13,524 --> 00:51:15,884
- How do I do this? - Haven't you done it before?

1322
00:51:15,884 --> 00:51:17,354
(The next one to escape is Kwang Soo.)

1323
00:51:18,124 --> 00:51:20,154
I've never tried it before.

1324
00:51:20,154 --> 00:51:21,984
(The whistles keep blowing.)

1325
00:51:21,984 --> 00:51:23,384
- Hey. - They're coming.

1326
00:51:23,384 --> 00:51:25,724
(He's upset about the reality.)

1327
00:51:25,724 --> 00:51:28,184
- You're younger than me. - Gosh.

1328
00:51:28,184 --> 00:51:29,184
(He's afraid to escape.)

1329
00:51:29,184 --> 00:51:31,154
- Come on, Kwang Soo. - This is too difficult.

1330
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:33,624
- You're set. Go on. - This is too harsh.

1331
00:51:33,624 --> 00:51:35,884
- Go down. - We don't have enough gears.

1332
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,654
(All he has is one rope.)

1333
00:51:37,654 --> 00:51:38,924
It's okay. Just go.

1334
00:51:38,924 --> 00:51:40,524
- Gosh, Kwang Soo. - Wait.

1335
00:51:40,524 --> 00:51:42,984
- I might fall off. - It's okay.

1336
00:51:42,984 --> 00:51:44,754
- I'm going to fall off. - Turn back and go down.

1337
00:51:44,754 --> 00:51:46,354
(He can't move at all.)

1338
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:48,084
- How? - Just go.

1339
00:51:48,084 --> 00:51:50,654
- Grab this. - Otherwise, they'll catch us all.

1340
00:51:50,654 --> 00:51:51,824
Hold on the right.

1341
00:51:51,824 --> 00:51:52,954
(Kwang Soo might not survive.)

1342
00:51:52,954 --> 00:51:54,784
- Get on all fours. - It moves down.

1343
00:51:54,984 --> 00:51:57,724
- It moves down. - Hurry up and come down.

1344
00:51:57,724 --> 00:51:59,084
(Kwang Soo is too cowardly.)

1345
00:51:59,084 --> 00:52:00,524
My goodness.

1346
00:52:00,524 --> 00:52:02,624
I'll stay in prison forever if I have to.

1347
00:52:02,624 --> 00:52:04,384
- I can't do this. - Just go down.

1348
00:52:04,384 --> 00:52:08,024
- Come on, Kwang Soo. - You brake with your right hand.

1349
00:52:08,454 --> 00:52:09,554
That's not it.

1350
00:52:11,024 --> 00:52:12,984
(He's too scared.)

1351
00:52:14,984 --> 00:52:17,754
(Will they make it to the wedding?)

1352
00:52:17,754 --> 00:52:19,554
- Put your feet down. - There you go.

1353
00:52:19,624 --> 00:52:21,384
(He can't make himself escape.)

1354
00:52:21,384 --> 00:52:22,424
Put your feet down.

1355
00:52:22,724 --> 00:52:23,824
Put your feet down.

1356
00:52:24,254 --> 00:52:25,584
Kwang Soo.

1357
00:52:25,984 --> 00:52:27,454
- Stay alert. - Hey!

1358
00:52:27,454 --> 00:52:28,854
(He gets dizzy.)

1359
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,824
(Escaping is too hard for him.)

1360
00:52:30,824 --> 00:52:32,354
Let go of the rope a little.

1361
00:52:32,354 --> 00:52:33,824
(He descends slowly.)

1362
00:52:33,824 --> 00:52:35,554
- Do it slowly. - You'll be okay.

1363
00:52:35,554 --> 00:52:38,524
- You're descending. - There you go.

1364
00:52:38,524 --> 00:52:40,054
(He squirms.)

1365
00:52:40,054 --> 00:52:41,654
It's getting faster.

1366
00:52:41,654 --> 00:52:43,354
No, you can control the speed.

1367
00:52:43,354 --> 00:52:44,984
(He moves slowly like a praying mantis.)

1368
00:52:45,354 --> 00:52:47,784
- Don't look down. - Keep descending.

1369
00:52:48,284 --> 00:52:49,724
- This is very scary. - He's almost there.

1370
00:52:49,724 --> 00:52:51,224
(They're proud of Kwang Soo.)

1371
00:52:51,224 --> 00:52:54,454
- He's almost there. - I'll just stay in prison.

1372
00:52:54,454 --> 00:52:55,554
I can't do it.

1373
00:52:55,554 --> 00:52:57,624
(He barely descends to the 2nd story.)

1374
00:52:57,624 --> 00:52:59,284
- I can't do it. - He's almost there.

1375
00:52:59,284 --> 00:53:00,724
Do you have any water?

1376
00:53:00,954 --> 00:53:02,024
Do you have water?

1377
00:53:02,624 --> 00:53:03,924
I'm getting dizzy.

1378
00:53:04,124 --> 00:53:07,024
Kwang Soo, you must come down now.

1379
00:53:07,024 --> 00:53:08,724
- That's right. - Hurry up.

1380
00:53:08,724 --> 00:53:10,154
(Too much time passed.)

1381
00:53:10,154 --> 00:53:14,084
- You're almost there. - The ground is too far.

1382
00:53:14,084 --> 00:53:16,824
You won't die even if you jump off.

1383
00:53:16,854 --> 00:53:21,154
Keep your legs still and lower your bottom.

1384
00:53:21,154 --> 00:53:24,984
- Keep your legs straight. - Why hasn't he moved at all?

1385
00:53:24,984 --> 00:53:26,954
(He can't control himself.)

1386
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:29,084
- What on earth is he doing? - Wait!

1387
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:31,384
(He can't control his body.)

1388
00:53:31,384 --> 00:53:32,954
- I straightened my legs. - What's going on?

1389
00:53:32,954 --> 00:53:35,024
- Hurry up! - How?

1390
00:53:35,024 --> 00:53:36,454
- Do I let go? - Yes.

1391
00:53:36,454 --> 00:53:38,054
- Do I let my legs go? - Let them go.

1392
00:53:38,054 --> 00:53:40,524
(He's close to the ground.)

1393
00:53:40,524 --> 00:53:42,924
- Let them go. - There you go.

1394
00:53:42,924 --> 00:53:44,724
- He's descending. - There he goes.

1395
00:53:44,724 --> 00:53:45,754
(He descends very slowly.)

1396
00:53:45,754 --> 00:53:47,024
(Dragging)

1397
00:53:47,554 --> 00:53:48,854
He's going down.

1398
00:53:48,854 --> 00:53:50,384
(He lands on his back.)

1399
00:53:50,384 --> 00:53:52,284
He's very startled.

1400
00:53:52,284 --> 00:53:53,754
He looks pale.

1401
00:53:53,754 --> 00:53:55,654
Was it scary, Kwang Soo?

1402
00:53:56,484 --> 00:53:58,154
(He almost died.)

1403
00:53:58,154 --> 00:53:59,554
Thank you.

1404
00:53:59,554 --> 00:54:02,754
- Turn around. - I'm afraid of heights.

1405
00:54:02,754 --> 00:54:06,124
- I'm really terrified of heights. - We know.

1406
00:54:06,124 --> 00:54:07,154
(He makes a big fuss.)

1407
00:54:07,154 --> 00:54:09,984
- We know it better than anyone. - I hate high places.

1408
00:54:09,984 --> 00:54:11,024
(There isn't much time left.)

1409
00:54:11,024 --> 00:54:13,784
It gets easy after you take the first step.

1410
00:54:14,154 --> 00:54:16,654
(He must lean outside the window.)

1411
00:54:16,654 --> 00:54:20,354
- Lean your legs against the wall. - Is this how you do it?

1412
00:54:20,354 --> 00:54:22,654
(He spreads his legs wide.)

1413
00:54:22,654 --> 00:54:24,884
- Is this it? - Is this how I do it?

1414
00:54:25,824 --> 00:54:29,554
(He's determined to marry off Seok Jin today.)

1415
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,024
(Will Jae Seok make it to the ground?)

1416
00:54:33,024 --> 00:54:34,724
This is how you do it.

1417
00:54:34,724 --> 00:54:36,024
(He stumbles.)

1418
00:54:36,024 --> 00:54:38,184
- There you go. - Is this right?

1419
00:54:38,184 --> 00:54:40,854
(He descends while jumping awkwardly.)

1420
00:54:40,854 --> 00:54:42,454
- Like this? - That's right.

1421
00:54:42,454 --> 00:54:44,984
- I'm afraid of falling backwards. - Okay.

1422
00:54:45,754 --> 00:54:47,154
He's doing well.

1423
00:54:47,154 --> 00:54:48,654
(Jae Seok turns into Spiderman.)

1424
00:54:48,654 --> 00:54:49,854
Do it like this.

1425
00:54:50,354 --> 00:54:53,824
- He's very brave. - Watch me carefully.

1426
00:54:53,824 --> 00:54:55,484
- It's okay if you hold on tightly. - Why are you trembling?

1427
00:54:55,484 --> 00:54:58,084
- Look at Jae Seok. - It's because I'm too scared.

1428
00:54:58,084 --> 00:55:01,854
Jae Seok is brave enough to lean back like that.

1429
00:55:01,854 --> 00:55:02,854
(He's determined.)

1430
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:06,224
Jae Seok is brave enough to lean back like that.

1431
00:55:06,224 --> 00:55:07,624
(He lands lightly.)

1432
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,154
Jae Seok.

1433
00:55:09,354 --> 00:55:10,854
(Jae Seok escapes successfully.)

1434
00:55:10,854 --> 00:55:13,024
- You did it. - My goodness.

1435
00:55:13,024 --> 00:55:14,684
You're the best, Jae Seok.

1436
00:55:14,684 --> 00:55:15,984
(Only 50 minutes remain.)

1437
00:55:16,854 --> 00:55:19,924
- Are you taking the same position? - Wait.

1438
00:55:19,924 --> 00:55:22,984
- What's wrong? - My neck feels stiff.

1439
00:55:24,024 --> 00:55:25,724
(His neck hurts in the back.)

1440
00:55:25,724 --> 00:55:27,524
We're such cowards.

1441
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:30,384
(We're a team of cowards.)

1442
00:55:31,084 --> 00:55:32,284
Hurry up.

1443
00:55:33,084 --> 00:55:34,654
Haha, it's okay.

1444
00:55:34,654 --> 00:55:36,854
We have to get to the wedding.

1445
00:55:36,854 --> 00:55:38,454
- You're set. - Wait.

1446
00:55:38,454 --> 00:55:39,454
(Haha is too scared.)

1447
00:55:39,454 --> 00:55:41,554
- Wait, Jong Kook. - You're set.

1448
00:55:41,554 --> 00:55:42,754
(Please call the ambulance.)

1449
00:55:42,754 --> 00:55:44,754
Put your feet out first.

1450
00:55:44,754 --> 00:55:46,454
- Put your feet out first. - Wait.

1451
00:55:46,454 --> 00:55:47,524
(He's too afraid to move.)

1452
00:55:47,524 --> 00:55:48,824
Move your legs first.

1453
00:55:48,884 --> 00:55:51,654
Push your bottom out and straighten your legs.

1454
00:55:51,654 --> 00:55:52,984
I can't straighten my legs.

1455
00:55:52,984 --> 00:55:54,754
(Haha can't make himself do it.)

1456
00:55:55,284 --> 00:55:56,654
You must lean back.

1457
00:55:56,654 --> 00:55:58,754
(Kwang Soo gives advice based on his experience.)

1458
00:55:58,754 --> 00:55:59,754
Just trust the safety guards.

1459
00:55:59,754 --> 00:56:01,724
(Kwang Soo forgot about his past.)

1460
00:56:02,424 --> 00:56:03,924
(Haha finally leans out.)

1461
00:56:03,924 --> 00:56:05,354
Hold the rope with both hands.

1462
00:56:05,354 --> 00:56:07,624
- There you go. - You got it.

1463
00:56:07,624 --> 00:56:11,384
(He's no longer a coward.)

1464
00:56:11,384 --> 00:56:14,454
(He will show what being a real man is all about.)

1465
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,184
- I can't go down. - Use your legs.

1466
00:56:16,184 --> 00:56:17,784
No, wait.

1467
00:56:17,784 --> 00:56:20,354
(He fails to descend.)

1468
00:56:21,054 --> 00:56:22,454
I can't do it.

1469
00:56:22,554 --> 00:56:24,054
- Goodness. - I can't go down.

1470
00:56:24,054 --> 00:56:25,124
I'll go first.

1471
00:56:25,124 --> 00:56:26,824
(He blames the rope for not working properly.)

1472
00:56:26,824 --> 00:56:27,854
Take a rest.

1473
00:56:28,824 --> 00:56:31,554
I'll try it again. I almost made it, didn't I?

1474
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:32,954
You punk!

1475
00:56:33,054 --> 00:56:36,154
Hurry up. We have a wedding to attend.

1476
00:56:36,554 --> 00:56:38,024
Lower yourself slowly.

1477
00:56:38,024 --> 00:56:40,354
- Can you pull me up? Sorry. - What's wrong?

1478
00:56:40,354 --> 00:56:41,624
Let go of your right arm.

1479
00:56:41,624 --> 00:56:42,754
(He fails again.)

1480
00:56:42,754 --> 00:56:44,554
You're gripping too hard with the left hand.

1481
00:56:44,554 --> 00:56:45,724
(It's not that complicated.)

1482
00:56:46,054 --> 00:56:47,284
Okay, I'll do it.

1483
00:56:47,524 --> 00:56:49,354
I'll imagine Dream is down there.

1484
00:56:49,354 --> 00:56:50,354
That's right.

1485
00:56:50,354 --> 00:56:51,454
(He remembers that he's a father.)

1486
00:56:51,454 --> 00:56:54,184
- I must go down to save him. - That's right.

1487
00:56:54,924 --> 00:56:58,854
(As a father, he's determined to succeed.)

1488
00:56:59,954 --> 00:57:01,524
(Dream, are you watching me?)

1489
00:57:02,354 --> 00:57:03,984
- Here I go. - Go.

1490
00:57:05,754 --> 00:57:10,354
(Haha was terribly afraid of heights.)

1491
00:57:11,424 --> 00:57:15,124
(He hated being in high places.)

1492
00:57:15,124 --> 00:57:19,854
(He was never manly enough.)

1493
00:57:21,284 --> 00:57:23,054
(He challenges himself as a father and not just a man.)

1494
00:57:23,424 --> 00:57:25,184
- I'm going. - Go.

1495
00:57:26,584 --> 00:57:29,254
- I need to save Dream, right? - That's right.

1496
00:57:30,424 --> 00:57:31,424
(Haha takes small steps thinking about Dream.)

1497
00:57:31,424 --> 00:57:33,984
Don't worry. You did it.

1498
00:57:34,024 --> 00:57:36,154
You did it. That's it.

1499
00:57:36,154 --> 00:57:37,624
- Good job. - That's it.

1500
00:57:37,624 --> 00:57:39,824
- He's losing focus. - That's it.

1501
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:41,654
- You did it. - Good job.

1502
00:57:41,654 --> 00:57:43,624
- There's a window coming up. - Good job.

1503
00:57:43,624 --> 00:57:46,084
- You're good. - All right.

1504
00:57:47,054 --> 00:57:48,124
You're special forces.

1505
00:57:48,124 --> 00:57:49,524
- Good job. - Why are you so good?

1506
00:57:49,524 --> 00:57:50,754
- All right. - Oh, my goodness.

1507
00:57:50,754 --> 00:57:52,684
(He lands on 2nd floor.)

1508
00:57:53,184 --> 00:57:54,784
Go at once.

1509
00:57:54,784 --> 00:57:58,854
(Haha is Dream's father and not a coward.)

1510
00:57:59,524 --> 00:58:01,084
(I can do it.)

1511
00:58:01,084 --> 00:58:02,384
- Come straight down. - You're good.

1512
00:58:02,454 --> 00:58:03,624
- Come straight down. - All right.

1513
00:58:03,984 --> 00:58:05,324
You're good.

1514
00:58:05,384 --> 00:58:07,124
That's right.

1515
00:58:07,154 --> 00:58:09,284
Dream!

1516
00:58:09,284 --> 00:58:11,724
- I came here to save you. - Dream.

1517
00:58:11,724 --> 00:58:13,424
- Why are you mentioning Dream? - What did he say?

1518
00:58:13,754 --> 00:58:14,884
- Dream. - What did he say?

1519
00:58:14,884 --> 00:58:16,124
Why are you mentioning Dream?

1520
00:58:16,124 --> 00:58:18,654
I came down to save you.

1521
00:58:18,724 --> 00:58:20,424
Why are you mentioning Dream?

1522
00:58:20,424 --> 00:58:21,684
It's really not flattering.

1523
00:58:21,684 --> 00:58:24,484
- It really isn't. - Why are you mentioning Dream?

1524
00:58:24,484 --> 00:58:26,084
- Why did he say his name? - I love you!

1525
00:58:26,554 --> 00:58:28,454
The 7 of us are 1!

1526
00:58:28,884 --> 00:58:31,084
- Why are you mentioning Dream? - I did it.

1527
00:58:31,124 --> 00:58:33,124
- Why are you mentioning Dream? - Dream.

1528
00:58:33,124 --> 00:58:34,554
Why are you mentioning Dream?

1529
00:58:34,754 --> 00:58:35,824
You did it.

1530
00:58:36,754 --> 00:58:38,554
- You can do it. - For goodness' sake.

1531
00:58:39,084 --> 00:58:40,154
(He feels pressured because all the cowards did it.)

1532
00:58:40,154 --> 00:58:41,584
This is driving me nuts.

1533
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:44,154
- It's your wedding, Seok Jin. - Seok Jin.

1534
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:46,424
We're doing this because of you.

1535
00:58:46,424 --> 00:58:48,184
- Seok Jin. - This is all your fault!

1536
00:58:48,284 --> 00:58:50,424
It's your wedding, Seok Jin.

1537
00:58:51,224 --> 00:58:53,084
(Thank you but can I not go?)

1538
00:58:54,124 --> 00:58:57,584
Put your right hand near your waist.

1539
00:58:57,724 --> 00:59:00,454
Bring the rope to your right. It's too near the back.

1540
00:59:00,524 --> 00:59:02,484
- Move your right hand. - Like this?

1541
00:59:02,484 --> 00:59:05,684
Let go. They're holding on so you won't fall.

1542
00:59:06,524 --> 00:59:07,754
(Well...)

1543
00:59:07,754 --> 00:59:09,084
He can't.

1544
00:59:09,084 --> 00:59:11,354
Do you want to go to my wedding first?

1545
00:59:11,354 --> 00:59:14,584
Do you want to go first and collect money gifts?

1546
00:59:14,924 --> 00:59:17,684
- Tell them I'm going to be late. - Seok Jin.

1547
00:59:17,684 --> 00:59:21,084
You can let go a little. You won't fall.

1548
00:59:21,084 --> 00:59:22,684
- That's brake. - Okay.

1549
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,654
Haha, can you be quiet?

1550
00:59:24,924 --> 00:59:26,884
I don't think you're in any position to tell me what to do.

1551
00:59:26,884 --> 00:59:29,084
- You can do it. - You just need to take a step.

1552
00:59:29,084 --> 00:59:31,624
- I'm more of a coward than you. - You two can't tell me what to do.

1553
00:59:31,624 --> 00:59:32,684
- Exactly. - Seok Jin.

1554
00:59:32,684 --> 00:59:35,454
- Even I did it. You can do it. - This is nothing.

1555
00:59:35,884 --> 00:59:38,054
- Is it good? - It's good.

1556
00:59:38,224 --> 00:59:41,924
- Let's go. - My left hand is weak.

1557
00:59:42,024 --> 00:59:43,524
- Is it all right? - Use your right hand.

1558
00:59:43,524 --> 00:59:46,824
(Would Seok Jin manage?)

1559
00:59:47,384 --> 00:59:51,184
(Seok Jin's dream is to have a romantic wedding.)

1560
00:59:51,184 --> 00:59:55,454
(They must get to the venue in 40 minutes to make it happen.)

1561
00:59:55,454 --> 00:59:57,484
It's your wedding, Seok Jin.

1562
00:59:57,824 --> 01:00:00,024
The instructors will take care of it.

1563
01:00:00,524 --> 01:00:02,184
- I didn't do it by myself. - That's good.

1564
01:00:02,584 --> 01:00:05,384
- You're good. - Let go of your right hand.

1565
01:00:05,384 --> 01:00:06,684
You're good.

1566
01:00:06,684 --> 01:00:08,124
- Let go. - You're good.

1567
01:00:08,124 --> 01:00:09,424
Let go. The instructors will help you.

1568
01:00:09,424 --> 01:00:12,054
- Use your right hand. - Let go.

1569
01:00:12,224 --> 01:00:14,254
- You're good. - You're almost there.

1570
01:00:14,824 --> 01:00:17,254
- You're almost there. - Wait. It's going too fast.

1571
01:00:17,254 --> 01:00:18,954
- It's going too fast. - Don't worry.

1572
01:00:18,954 --> 01:00:21,884
- It's going too fast. - Let go of your right hand.

1573
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:23,624
Let go and grab it again.

1574
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:25,824
- It's hardest in the beginning. - All right.

1575
01:00:27,324 --> 01:00:28,454
What do you need?

1576
01:00:30,384 --> 01:00:31,754
Look above.

1577
01:00:31,754 --> 01:00:34,184
Why are you dancing?

1578
01:00:34,684 --> 01:00:36,124
You're almost there.

1579
01:00:36,124 --> 01:00:37,784
(He does a twist on the wall.)

1580
01:00:37,784 --> 01:00:39,924
- You're almost there. - I think he got it.

1581
01:00:40,424 --> 01:00:41,824
Let go of your right hand.

1582
01:00:42,254 --> 01:00:43,584
Don't hold on. Let go.

1583
01:00:43,584 --> 01:00:44,854
- Should I let go? - Yes.

1584
01:00:44,854 --> 01:00:47,584
How? How am I supposed to let go?

1585
01:00:48,624 --> 01:00:49,884
Let go. You can let go.

1586
01:00:49,884 --> 01:00:51,884
Let go. You have to.

1587
01:00:51,884 --> 01:00:53,354
Look at him.

1588
01:00:53,424 --> 01:00:54,524
My gosh.

1589
01:00:54,524 --> 01:00:56,584
- I wasn't that bad, right? - You weren't.

1590
01:00:56,584 --> 01:00:58,084
Didn't I look cool near the end?

1591
01:00:58,084 --> 01:00:59,154
You did.

1592
01:00:59,154 --> 01:01:02,254
You know what's worse about this?

1593
01:01:02,254 --> 01:01:04,984
When Kwang Soo was stuck before,

1594
01:01:04,984 --> 01:01:08,084
he said, "You won't hurt yourself even if you jumped down from there."

1595
01:01:08,084 --> 01:01:09,384
(He was being so harsh to Kwang Soo.)

1596
01:01:10,354 --> 01:01:11,484
I'm so embarrassed.

1597
01:01:11,484 --> 01:01:12,554
(I respect you, Kwang Soo and Haha.)

1598
01:01:12,554 --> 01:01:15,484
- It was so difficult. - I'm happy that I'm on the ground.

1599
01:01:15,484 --> 01:01:16,524
(There's only Jong Kook left.)

1600
01:01:16,984 --> 01:01:19,184
- I was afraid the rope would break. - I'm coming.

1601
01:01:19,184 --> 01:01:21,824
- Hurry up. - Use your right hand.

1602
01:01:22,484 --> 01:01:24,084
He'll be fine.

1603
01:01:26,184 --> 01:01:30,184
(There are prison guards that are after Jong Kook.)

1604
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:35,684
(Will Jong Kook safely escape prison?)

1605
01:01:36,154 --> 01:01:37,554
(He's incredible.)

1606
01:01:38,484 --> 01:01:41,224
- Listen to that. - Be careful.

1607
01:01:42,384 --> 01:01:43,784
He's like Spiderman.

1608
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:46,854
Be careful.

1609
01:01:47,154 --> 01:01:49,154
You can let go.

1610
01:01:49,584 --> 01:01:50,954
He escaped.

1611
01:01:51,884 --> 01:01:53,984
- That was so simple. - It's good.

1612
01:01:53,984 --> 01:01:55,454
(It would be that easy for me if I did it again.)

1613
01:01:55,454 --> 01:01:56,884
- I can do better if I did it again. - Same here.

1614
01:01:56,884 --> 01:01:59,524
- I think... - You're number one.

1615
01:02:00,184 --> 01:02:01,884
Hurry up. There's no time.

1616
01:02:02,254 --> 01:02:03,724
Let's go.

1617
01:02:03,724 --> 01:02:05,854
There are guards after us.

1618
01:02:05,854 --> 01:02:07,824
- Let's go. - There are guards after us.

1619
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:09,424
This isn't necessary.

1620
01:02:09,424 --> 01:02:10,984
Guards are after us.

1621
01:02:10,984 --> 01:02:12,424
(Soo Jeong is waiting for her groom.)

1622
01:02:12,424 --> 01:02:15,554
(Will Seok Jin reach her for the wedding?)

1623
01:02:16,654 --> 01:02:18,884
(What's awaiting the members after their escape?)

1624
01:02:21,384 --> 01:02:22,584
What's this?

1625
01:02:23,554 --> 01:02:25,024
What's this?

1626
01:02:25,254 --> 01:02:26,924
- What's this? - What's this?

1627
01:02:27,024 --> 01:02:28,824
Please stand in front of the boxes.

1628
01:02:28,824 --> 01:02:31,254
- Can we open it? - I was wearing this in the morning.

1629
01:02:31,824 --> 01:02:33,524
I was wearing this in the morning.

1630
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:34,754
I don't have mine.

1631
01:02:34,754 --> 01:02:36,184
Seok Jin is missing his.

1632
01:02:37,524 --> 01:02:39,854
(His tuxedo is gone.)

1633
01:02:39,854 --> 01:02:41,484
Seok Jin, you must be the naked groom.

1634
01:02:41,484 --> 01:02:43,724
"Answer questions about your wife to get your clothes."

1635
01:02:43,724 --> 01:02:47,024
"The box with the correct answer has the tuxedo."

1636
01:02:47,224 --> 01:02:49,154
You won't just give it to me?

1637
01:02:49,154 --> 01:02:50,524
(If his answer is incorrect, he'll get something unexpected.)

1638
01:02:50,524 --> 01:02:52,624
- What's this? - You should just give it to me.

1639
01:02:52,624 --> 01:02:55,024
You thought he'll forget about their first kiss?

1640
01:02:55,024 --> 01:02:56,524
- Right? - Look at the question.

1641
01:02:56,524 --> 01:02:58,324
- Why would I not know? - You don't remember?

1642
01:02:58,324 --> 01:02:59,824
You know me.

1643
01:02:59,824 --> 01:03:02,684
We used to spend a lot of time in my car when we were dating.

1644
01:03:02,684 --> 01:03:05,624
We were by the riverside and I asked my wife to count...

1645
01:03:05,624 --> 01:03:07,254
if 63 Building actually had 63 floors.

1646
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:09,524
That's how much time we spent in the car.

1647
01:03:09,824 --> 01:03:11,554
- Car. - Are you sure?

1648
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:12,884
- Open it. - Are you sure?

1649
01:03:12,884 --> 01:03:15,384
- Of course. It has to be. - It's for sure.

1650
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:19,424
(He was so confident. What's in the box?)

1651
01:03:19,424 --> 01:03:20,754
It's for sure.

1652
01:03:21,154 --> 01:03:23,784
- What a relief. - You don't even have to think.

1653
01:03:24,154 --> 01:03:25,454
This is great.

1654
01:03:25,824 --> 01:03:27,924
- Can he open the other ones? - What's that one?

1655
01:03:27,924 --> 01:03:29,424
(What's in the other boxes?)

1656
01:03:29,484 --> 01:03:30,554
They're straw shoes.

1657
01:03:30,554 --> 01:03:32,854
- It would have been funny. - You almost had these.

1658
01:03:33,284 --> 01:03:34,784
"What gift does your wife want for this wedding anniversary?"

1659
01:03:35,384 --> 01:03:37,224
- This one's difficult. - It's a tough one.

1660
01:03:37,224 --> 01:03:39,184
- I think I know. - Really?

1661
01:03:39,254 --> 01:03:40,754
- I think it's vacation. - I think I know.

1662
01:03:40,754 --> 01:03:42,354
- That's not it. - What about a handbag?

1663
01:03:42,354 --> 01:03:43,884
- A handbag? - A ring and necklace?

1664
01:03:43,884 --> 01:03:45,724
- It is 100 percent this one. - That's right.

1665
01:03:45,724 --> 01:03:46,984
- Really? - He didn't even hesitate.

1666
01:03:46,984 --> 01:03:48,754
- He didn't even hesitate. - That's what she would want.

1667
01:03:48,754 --> 01:03:50,384
It's 100 percent ring and necklace.

1668
01:03:50,384 --> 01:03:52,854
(He's becoming more confident.)

1669
01:03:52,854 --> 01:03:56,154
(Will he get two in a row?)

1670
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:58,984
(He's correct. He gets tuxedo pants.)

1671
01:03:59,354 --> 01:04:01,224
- He's a true lover. - Why am I so good?

1672
01:04:01,224 --> 01:04:02,584
That's so cool.

1673
01:04:02,584 --> 01:04:05,584
- You look so cool. - Why do I know my wife so well?

1674
01:04:05,584 --> 01:04:06,684
It's nothing.

1675
01:04:08,284 --> 01:04:10,124
- Hold on. - What you wore to the first date?

1676
01:04:10,124 --> 01:04:11,484
I don't know about mine.

1677
01:04:11,484 --> 01:04:13,724
- Are you supposed to know this? - How would you know?

1678
01:04:13,884 --> 01:04:15,724
- I'm between these two. - This is confusing.

1679
01:04:15,724 --> 01:04:17,454
- I'm between these two. - This is difficult.

1680
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:19,354
- I remember mine. - I'm between these two.

1681
01:04:19,354 --> 01:04:22,024
I was wearing jeans for sure. The day before,

1682
01:04:22,084 --> 01:04:23,354
I slept over at his place.

1683
01:04:23,354 --> 01:04:24,354
You wore jeans.

1684
01:04:24,354 --> 01:04:26,824
I slept over at his place and went out for the blind date.

1685
01:04:26,824 --> 01:04:28,754
If you slept over, it can't be a white shirt.

1686
01:04:28,954 --> 01:04:30,884
- You don't think so? - It would have gotten dirty.

1687
01:04:30,884 --> 01:04:32,954
- I didn't wear black shirts though. - It would have been dirty.

1688
01:04:32,954 --> 01:04:34,154
- It's a white shirt. - It is, right?

1689
01:04:34,154 --> 01:04:37,324
- It's a white shirt. - It can't be a white shirt.

1690
01:04:37,324 --> 01:04:39,484
(They all sound convincing. What would Seok Jin choose?)

1691
01:04:39,484 --> 01:04:41,224
- I think it's a white shirt. - It's white shirt.

1692
01:04:41,224 --> 01:04:43,524
(He chooses jeans, white shirt, and a black cap.)

1693
01:04:44,024 --> 01:04:45,084
Are you going with that?

1694
01:04:45,224 --> 01:04:46,384
Let's do it.

1695
01:04:46,384 --> 01:04:48,124
In 1, 2, 3.

1696
01:04:48,124 --> 01:04:50,324
(Would he establish himself as a true lover?)

1697
01:04:52,324 --> 01:04:54,254
I had no idea.

1698
01:04:54,684 --> 01:04:56,354
It looks like you're performing.

1699
01:04:56,354 --> 01:04:58,384
(He gets a sweatshirt.)

1700
01:04:58,584 --> 01:04:59,584
It looks like you're performing.

1701
01:04:59,584 --> 01:05:01,924
- It was a black shirt. - It was black.

1702
01:05:02,084 --> 01:05:04,354
- It was a black shirt. - Just wear this.

1703
01:05:04,354 --> 01:05:05,684
I should have used the chance card.

1704
01:05:05,684 --> 01:05:07,684
- I guess it's a casual wedding. - That's right.

1705
01:05:08,024 --> 01:05:09,424
You're so classy.

1706
01:05:09,424 --> 01:05:11,084
- My goodness. - This is good.

1707
01:05:11,084 --> 01:05:12,254
Do I look all right?

1708
01:05:12,254 --> 01:05:13,424
It's excellent.

1709
01:05:13,884 --> 01:05:16,024
- Charming sides are difficult. - This is tough.

1710
01:05:16,054 --> 01:05:17,784
- It's one of these. - It's this one. You're kind.

1711
01:05:17,784 --> 01:05:19,384
- It's one of these. - It's this one.

1712
01:05:19,384 --> 01:05:20,984
- She likes it when I'm kind. - This should be it.

1713
01:05:20,984 --> 01:05:23,584
- The question gave it away. - I'm pretty kind to her.

1714
01:05:23,584 --> 01:05:24,684
What's that?

1715
01:05:24,684 --> 01:05:26,054
(He chooses his charm as being a kind man.)

1716
01:05:26,054 --> 01:05:27,584
"Running Man make-up"?

1717
01:05:29,524 --> 01:05:31,684
- Am I wrong? This is incorrect? - I guess not.

1718
01:05:31,684 --> 01:05:33,554
Maybe it's that he doesn't get mad easily.

1719
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:34,784
- Please. - Don't worry.

1720
01:05:34,784 --> 01:05:36,284
Let me go like this.

1721
01:05:36,284 --> 01:05:37,524
(They've been married for 19 years and he didn't even know.)

1722
01:05:38,824 --> 01:05:40,784
I look like a bully.

1723
01:05:41,324 --> 01:05:43,154
- You look fine. - You look good.

1724
01:05:43,154 --> 01:05:45,284
- You look good. - It's great.

1725
01:05:45,284 --> 01:05:47,824
- It's actually better this way. - Do this side too.

1726
01:05:47,824 --> 01:05:48,884
(This is Seok Jin's type of attire for the wedding.)

1727
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:52,724
(They arrive at the venue at 4:50pm.)

1728
01:05:53,484 --> 01:05:56,024
(Soo Jeong awaits her husband.)

1729
01:05:56,024 --> 01:05:58,954
My gosh.

1730
01:05:59,954 --> 01:06:01,224
It's a reminder wedding.

1731
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:03,254
Excuse me.

1732
01:06:03,254 --> 01:06:04,884
(Where is my lovely bride?)

1733
01:06:04,884 --> 01:06:06,624
It's Soo Jeong.

1734
01:06:06,624 --> 01:06:07,884
- Is it really her? - Soo Jeong.

1735
01:06:07,884 --> 01:06:09,754
- Oh, dear. - Is it you?

1736
01:06:09,754 --> 01:06:12,054
- Is it the groom's entry? - No, not yet.

1737
01:06:12,324 --> 01:06:13,984
I'm sorry for coming like this.

1738
01:06:14,654 --> 01:06:16,424
You look beautiful, Soo Jeong.

1739
01:06:16,424 --> 01:06:19,084
Soo Jeong, it's been a long time.

1740
01:06:19,084 --> 01:06:20,524
- Is it really her? - Hello.

1741
01:06:20,524 --> 01:06:21,884
She looks like Seol Hyun from the back.

1742
01:06:22,384 --> 01:06:24,254
(Is it really Seok Jin's wife?)

1743
01:06:24,854 --> 01:06:27,724
(She's the bride, the most special person for today.)

1744
01:06:28,224 --> 01:06:30,654
- Hello. - Hello.

1745
01:06:31,684 --> 01:06:33,084
Hello, Mrs. Jee.

1746
01:06:35,084 --> 01:06:36,554
- Hello. - We're sorry.

1747
01:06:37,054 --> 01:06:39,824
Soo Jeong.

1748
01:06:39,824 --> 01:06:41,524
- We're sorry. - She's beautiful.

1749
01:06:41,524 --> 01:06:43,184
- She's so pretty. - Hey.

1750
01:06:43,184 --> 01:06:44,784
He got a few questions wrong.

1751
01:06:44,784 --> 01:06:46,324
You're still handsome.

1752
01:06:46,954 --> 01:06:49,424
Really?

1753
01:06:49,424 --> 01:06:50,784
(She's the bride for sure.)

1754
01:06:52,054 --> 01:06:54,484
(Seok Jin's wedding commences.)

1755
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:57,924
Look at the audience.

1756
01:06:57,924 --> 01:07:00,084
(They feel nervous as if it was 19 years ago.)

1757
01:07:00,084 --> 01:07:04,024
Hello, I'm Yu Jae Seok, the host for today's wedding ceremony.

1758
01:07:04,884 --> 01:07:06,584
He's so handsome.

1759
01:07:06,584 --> 01:07:08,684
- He's a great host. - He's our friend.

1760
01:07:09,754 --> 01:07:12,224
Today's wedding...

1761
01:07:12,224 --> 01:07:15,154
is between Seok Jin and Soo Jeong who's been married for 19 years.

1762
01:07:15,154 --> 01:07:16,184
It's a valuable time...

1763
01:07:16,724 --> 01:07:19,154
for them to renew their vows.

1764
01:07:19,454 --> 01:07:21,454
Bride and groom.

1765
01:07:22,554 --> 01:07:23,684
Please come in.

1766
01:07:25,984 --> 01:07:28,184
You are so pretty.

1767
01:07:28,184 --> 01:07:29,584
(They enter with old flower girls.)

1768
01:07:29,584 --> 01:07:31,324
(They are blushing.)

1769
01:07:31,784 --> 01:07:36,024
The groom seems to be very active.

1770
01:07:36,654 --> 01:07:38,424
This is his ceremony to renew his vow.

1771
01:07:38,424 --> 01:07:40,724
This is truly touching.

1772
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:43,384
The groom has starred on "Capture the Moment How is that Possible".

1773
01:07:43,384 --> 01:07:44,984
"Capture the Moment How is that Possible"?

1774
01:07:45,184 --> 01:07:48,524
He appeared as a man who's happy all year long.

1775
01:07:49,354 --> 01:07:50,924
Please have a happy life.

1776
01:07:51,024 --> 01:07:52,384
Congratulations.

1777
01:07:52,384 --> 01:07:53,384
Next,

1778
01:07:53,384 --> 01:07:56,024
please bow to each other.

1779
01:07:57,184 --> 01:07:59,054
Please give a round of applause.

1780
01:08:00,924 --> 01:08:03,054
- They look great. - It has...

1781
01:08:03,124 --> 01:08:06,154
been 19 years since they've been in a wedding hall.

1782
01:08:06,154 --> 01:08:08,784
I imagine that they must be reminded of their memories.

1783
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:11,584
Jee Seok Jin, do you love your wife,

1784
01:08:11,584 --> 01:08:14,324
Ryu Soo Jeong, as you did 19 years ago?

1785
01:08:14,524 --> 01:08:16,654
I do!

1786
01:08:17,584 --> 01:08:18,784
- My gosh. - He's so cool.

1787
01:08:18,784 --> 01:08:21,624
Ryu Soo Jeong,

1788
01:08:21,754 --> 01:08:26,324
do you love your husband, Jee Seok Jin, as you did 19 years ago?

1789
01:08:26,584 --> 01:08:28,054
- I do. - All right.

1790
01:08:28,254 --> 01:08:29,384
She's crying.

1791
01:08:29,384 --> 01:08:32,724
- Why are you crying? - I hope your love won't change.

1792
01:08:32,824 --> 01:08:36,054
- Now, you will exchange the rings. - They have rings?

1793
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:41,684
The crew has prepared R Rings to commemorate the renewal.

1794
01:08:41,954 --> 01:08:45,084
He has never won that before.

1795
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:46,454
Now, he has won it.

1796
01:08:46,454 --> 01:08:48,584
- The ring fits perfectly. - Really?

1797
01:08:48,584 --> 01:08:50,254
My wife's ring size is nine.

1798
01:08:51,224 --> 01:08:53,784
- I'm about to cry now. - What a good husband.

1799
01:08:54,254 --> 01:08:55,554
I'm so moved.

1800
01:08:55,994 --> 01:08:58,884
The bride, Ryu Soo Jeong, has prepared a letter...

1801
01:08:58,994 --> 01:09:01,584
for her husband, Jee Seok Jin.

1802
01:09:01,584 --> 01:09:03,254
- Why did you do that? - Why don't you...

1803
01:09:03,254 --> 01:09:05,354
- read it out loud? - This will make people cry.

1804
01:09:06,054 --> 01:09:08,124
Dear my loving husband,

1805
01:09:09,254 --> 01:09:12,524
I met you when I was 24 years old. I was immature, then.

1806
01:09:12,524 --> 01:09:16,254
We gave birth to Hyun Woo. You became Hyun Woo's father.

1807
01:09:16,254 --> 01:09:20,284
It's been 20 years since you've been my husband.

1808
01:09:21,684 --> 01:09:24,284
We used to argue a lot before.

1809
01:09:24,454 --> 01:09:28,154
Now, we are too busy to argue. We are busy taking care of each other.

1810
01:09:29,454 --> 01:09:32,154
You protect us from this tough world.

1811
01:09:32,154 --> 01:09:34,454
You're always here when I need you.

1812
01:09:34,624 --> 01:09:38,584
You are my eternal, best friend who knows me so well.

1813
01:09:39,424 --> 01:09:41,524
There is no path to happiness.

1814
01:09:41,524 --> 01:09:43,184
Happiness is the path.

1815
01:09:43,754 --> 01:09:47,784
When we follow the path, just looking forward,

1816
01:09:47,994 --> 01:09:50,384
a happy life will unfold before us.

1817
01:09:51,054 --> 01:09:54,724
Let us keep our lifelong friendship, Honey.

1818
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:56,184
I love you.

1819
01:09:57,884 --> 01:09:59,024
Please give a round of applause.

1820
01:09:59,024 --> 01:10:00,954
(The groom holds back his tears.)

1821
01:10:00,954 --> 01:10:01,994
- My gosh. - Goodness.

1822
01:10:02,124 --> 01:10:03,284
(What a touching letter.)

1823
01:10:03,284 --> 01:10:05,054
Don't cry.

1824
01:10:05,054 --> 01:10:08,024
- He seems a bit overwhelmed. - Yes, he does.

1825
01:10:08,424 --> 01:10:09,954
- Seok Jin. - I am overwhelmed a bit.

1826
01:10:09,954 --> 01:10:12,354
Next, it's time for the song.

1827
01:10:12,424 --> 01:10:14,284
Is this how we should do it? Should we hold hands?

1828
01:10:16,054 --> 01:10:18,584
(They hold each other's hands.)

1829
01:10:18,584 --> 01:10:22,954
(They both look the same direction.)

1830
01:10:22,954 --> 01:10:24,054
This is nice.

1831
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:26,124
(She gets teary-eyed.)

1832
01:10:27,684 --> 01:10:33,994
(He sings sincerely to wish the best for them.)

1833
01:10:36,354 --> 01:10:38,284
- Why am I crying? - Why is she crying?

1834
01:10:39,754 --> 01:10:46,554
(Seok Jin and Soo Jeong survived tiring daily life and hard times...)

1835
01:10:46,554 --> 01:10:50,854
(because they have each other.)

1836
01:10:53,784 --> 01:11:01,724
(They stood by each other's side for 20 years as a friend and a lover.)

1837
01:11:02,854 --> 01:11:06,354
(Thank you for always being there.)

1838
01:11:08,994 --> 01:11:13,824
(Seok Jin sings seriously and finishes the song.)

1839
01:11:14,994 --> 01:11:16,584
(He embraces her.)

1840
01:11:17,724 --> 01:11:19,084
(I'm fortunate that you are with me.)

1841
01:11:19,084 --> 01:11:20,584
Thank you.

1842
01:11:20,584 --> 01:11:22,494
(I'm fortunate that you are with me.)

1843
01:11:23,054 --> 01:11:25,054
Congratulations on renewing your vows.

1844
01:11:25,184 --> 01:11:27,784
- This is for Soo Jeong. - Okay.

1845
01:11:28,424 --> 01:11:31,624
(He changes the lyrics to add her name in.)

1846
01:11:33,124 --> 01:11:36,554
(He wittily changes the lyrics so that everyone can sing along.)

1847
01:11:38,254 --> 01:11:40,624
(The groom sings a verse, too.)

1848
01:11:40,624 --> 01:11:42,384
(Blushing)

1849
01:11:43,554 --> 01:11:47,084
Thank you very much, Soo Jeong.

1850
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:52,884
Soo Jeong, it's already been 20 years.

1851
01:11:53,784 --> 01:11:57,494
(The professional singer changes the lyrics to sing a romantic serenade.)

1852
01:11:57,494 --> 01:11:58,824
Give a round of applause.

1853
01:11:59,624 --> 01:12:01,884
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1854
01:12:01,884 --> 01:12:03,254
It was my honor.

1855
01:12:03,454 --> 01:12:04,994
- Thank you. - I knew it.

1856
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:07,154
He improvised.

1857
01:12:07,154 --> 01:12:09,624
- Shouldn't we ask them to kiss? - We should.

1858
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:11,584
- Kiss her. - Give her a kiss.

1859
01:12:11,584 --> 01:12:13,654
- Please give her a kiss. - Kiss her.

1860
01:12:13,854 --> 01:12:16,494
Why don't we let them do it?

1861
01:12:16,494 --> 01:12:18,254
- She looks so pretty. - My goodness.

1862
01:12:18,254 --> 01:12:20,084
Please clap when they kiss.

1863
01:12:20,254 --> 01:12:21,324
To both of you,

1864
01:12:21,454 --> 01:12:22,824
we wish a happy life.

1865
01:12:22,824 --> 01:12:25,954
(We took care of each other with undying love for 20 years.)

1866
01:12:25,954 --> 01:12:27,884
(Let's only walk on flowery roads.)

1867
01:12:27,884 --> 01:12:31,684
Thank you for being with me. You are my rock.

1868
01:12:32,284 --> 01:12:36,184
I hope we can lead a happy and healthy life without getting old.

1869
01:12:36,554 --> 01:12:37,994
I love you, Honey.

1870
01:12:39,954 --> 01:12:44,494
(Seok Jin's week is a success. Seok Jin and Soo Jeong, always be happy.)

1871
01:12:44,494 --> 01:12:46,924
(Ultimate Battle of Supernaturals)

1872
01:12:47,184 --> 01:12:48,254
(Jae Seok)

1873
01:12:48,524 --> 01:12:49,924
(Ji Hyo)

1874
01:12:50,124 --> 01:12:51,184
(Seok Jin)

1875
01:12:51,494 --> 01:12:52,584
(Haha)

1876
01:12:52,584 --> 01:12:53,684
(Jong Kook)

1877
01:12:53,824 --> 01:12:55,324
(Kwang Soo)

1878
01:12:55,424 --> 01:12:56,924
(This is the ultimate battle of returning supernaturals.)

1879
01:12:57,954 --> 01:13:00,424
(This battle will determine the members' fates.)

1880
01:13:00,424 --> 01:13:03,684
(Is there a mysterious person behind this battle?)

1881
01:13:04,524 --> 01:13:08,024
(Who will be the winner of this shocking and terrifying battle?)

1882
01:13:09,254 --> 01:13:11,784
(Next week, Ultimate Battle of Supernaturals)
