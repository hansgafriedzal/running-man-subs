1
00:00:06,728 --> 00:00:09,731
(Spring is here.)

2
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:11,032
(Hangang Park is filled with the scent of flowers.)

3
00:00:11,032 --> 00:00:13,501
- Hello. - Hello.

4
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:14,803
- Hello. - It's a carpet.

5
00:00:14,803 --> 00:00:16,504
(The 6 members are as bright as the weather.)

6
00:00:16,504 --> 00:00:19,507
- Hello. - What is this?

7
00:00:19,507 --> 00:00:22,877
- Each stool has a name on it. - Okay.

8
00:00:22,877 --> 00:00:24,946
- Please sit on your stool. - Okay.

9
00:00:24,946 --> 00:00:28,583
- They do have names on them. - It looks luxurious.

10
00:00:29,017 --> 00:00:31,820
(The members are welcomed by five kinds of bite-size food.)

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,489
I've been feeling hungry.

12
00:00:34,622 --> 00:00:37,525
- It's eel and small octopus. - It's eel.

13
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:40,528
- I love small octopus. - It's braised spicy chicken.

14
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:43,198
- Which one? - The second one.

15
00:00:43,198 --> 00:00:45,333
- Is this chicken? - I love braised spicy chicken.

16
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:48,403
Last week, we asked you to recommend...

17
00:00:48,403 --> 00:00:52,407
your favorite restaurants that would perk up your appetite.

18
00:00:52,707 --> 00:00:56,044
What each of you is seeing on your table is...

19
00:00:56,044 --> 00:00:59,080
food from the restaurants recommended by the other members.

20
00:00:59,514 --> 00:01:01,850
Try them all...

21
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,419
and pick your three favorites.

22
00:01:04,419 --> 00:01:06,521
- Three? - After trying them all?

23
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:09,157
It's a blind test. Put aside your favorites quietly.

24
00:01:09,157 --> 00:01:12,026
- Are we supposed to remain quiet? - Is it a blind test?

25
00:01:12,193 --> 00:01:14,429
- Try them all and pick three? - Right now?

26
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:17,098
One is spicy, and the other is salty.

27
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:19,334
- It tastes good. - I'm done.

28
00:01:19,434 --> 00:01:22,604
- Pick three? - It has potatoes too.

29
00:01:22,604 --> 00:01:25,039
- It's very spicy. - I've picked three.

30
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:27,609
I have to choose this one.

31
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:30,245
- I've picked three. - This one has to be included.

32
00:01:30,245 --> 00:01:33,214
- I'm done. - I'm done.

33
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:34,215
(The blind test is over.)

34
00:01:34,215 --> 00:01:35,450
It tasted very good.

35
00:01:35,884 --> 00:01:38,686
Is the food really from the restaurants?

36
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:41,422
- Yes. - From the restaurants?

37
00:01:41,523 --> 00:01:43,992
I'm sure mine will be popular.

38
00:01:43,992 --> 00:01:47,695
- 4 restaurants have been chosen. - 4?

39
00:01:47,795 --> 00:01:49,631
Two restaurants share the first place.

40
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:52,133
(Which restaurants won the most votes?)

41
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:54,802
They're Seok Jin and Haha's picks.

42
00:01:55,703 --> 00:01:57,071
- See? - Which ones are they?

43
00:01:57,272 --> 00:02:00,775
(Seok Jin's place offers Korean soul food, braised spicy chicken.)

44
00:02:02,577 --> 00:02:07,815
(Haha's place offers spicy and sweet stir-fried small octopus.)

45
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:10,919
- I knew it. - I loved the sauce.

46
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,722
And Jong Kook and Kwang Soo share the second place.

47
00:02:14,722 --> 00:02:15,757
Yes!

48
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:19,427
(Jong Kook's place offers health food, roasted eel.)

49
00:02:21,462 --> 00:02:25,099
(Kwang Soo's place offers bulgogi stew.)

50
00:02:26,334 --> 00:02:30,004
- We'll visit these four. - Okay.

51
00:02:30,004 --> 00:02:33,441
Today's race is called Running Man's Food Guide.

52
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:35,443
- What? - "Running Man's Food Guide"?

53
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:37,078
- It sounds nice. - "Running Man's Food Guide"?

54
00:02:37,345 --> 00:02:40,181
It'd be so nice to have good food in the spring.

55
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:43,017
Running Man's Food Guide starts now.

56
00:02:43,017 --> 00:02:46,287
The food you'll get to try has...

57
00:02:46,354 --> 00:02:48,823
some secrets in it.

58
00:02:48,823 --> 00:02:50,191
(The food has secrets in it.)

59
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:52,627
- What secrets? - Secrets?

60
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:59,233
The team who finds out the secrets first will win.

61
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:02,036
(What's the delicious secret?)

62
00:03:02,236 --> 00:03:05,807
Today, two guests who specialize in food shows...

63
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:08,142
will join the game.

64
00:03:08,142 --> 00:03:10,345
- Do we have guests? - Where are they?

65
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:12,780
- Guests, please come in. - Who are they?

66
00:03:13,214 --> 00:03:16,217
(The guests will join the members on the gourmet tour.)

67
00:03:16,217 --> 00:03:20,154
- Bo Mi. - Min Yong.

68
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:23,524
- What's with your sunglasses? - It's been so long.

69
00:03:23,524 --> 00:03:26,327
- Hello. - What are you doing here?

70
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:28,596
(Let us introduce today's guests to you.)

71
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,232
(They appear on shows just to eat.)

72
00:03:31,232 --> 00:03:33,334
(They've been waiting for this moment.)

73
00:03:33,334 --> 00:03:35,236
(They're perfect guests for the gourmet tour.)

74
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:37,305
(Food shows are their specialty.)

75
00:03:37,305 --> 00:03:39,974
- Hello. - Hello.

76
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:42,977
SBS, Seoul Broadcasting System...

77
00:03:42,977 --> 00:03:45,947
(Seoul Broadcasting System?)

78
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,485
As I'm on Running Man today, I'm wearing running shoes.

79
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:53,688
I thought I'd be running around. I'm wearing a comfortable outfit.

80
00:03:53,688 --> 00:03:55,256
Haha rediscovered you, right?

81
00:03:55,256 --> 00:04:00,228
I don't know what he did, but that's not true.

82
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:03,064
I'd like to put this straight.

83
00:04:03,064 --> 00:04:06,801
Haha didn't rediscover me. I was just worried about him,

84
00:04:06,801 --> 00:04:09,704
so I made a comeback after a 10-year break.

85
00:04:10,004 --> 00:04:12,707
(15 years ago)

86
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:15,009
(Haha and Min Yong appeared in a comedy together.)

87
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:18,179
- Haha, you've got mail. - Mail?

88
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,052
(Min Yong made Haha a star.)

89
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,822
Haha could become a star...

90
00:04:27,822 --> 00:04:29,824
- thanks to Min Yong. - What are you talking about?

91
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:32,226
- He's like your mother. - I passed the audition.

92
00:04:32,226 --> 00:04:34,228
Min Yong gave birth to Haha,

93
00:04:34,228 --> 00:04:36,431
and I raised him.

94
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:38,933
I created him.

95
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:41,202
- What about my parents? - Jae Seok...

96
00:04:41,202 --> 00:04:44,172
- My parents raised me with love. - I'm talking right now.

97
00:04:44,405 --> 00:04:47,341
- I'm talking. - Right, you're our guest today.

98
00:04:47,341 --> 00:04:51,312
In addition to Min Yong, Bo Mi is here.

99
00:04:51,312 --> 00:04:53,214
It's been so long.

100
00:04:53,214 --> 00:04:55,216
- I'm here to eat. - Really?

101
00:04:55,216 --> 00:04:58,453
- You lost so much weight. - I'm gaining some back.

102
00:04:58,453 --> 00:05:01,556
- It's time to gain some back. - Is it an off-season?

103
00:05:01,556 --> 00:05:03,324
- Yes, it is. - I see.

104
00:05:03,324 --> 00:05:06,928
She's the first female singer who showed off her double chin.

105
00:05:06,928 --> 00:05:08,796
- That's right. - Look at that.

106
00:05:08,796 --> 00:05:10,832
- A lot of it has disappeared. - That's true.

107
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:13,000
- It's a shame a lot of it is gone. - You look like a toad.

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,304
- I'll come back when I have more. - I love Bo Mi.

109
00:05:16,304 --> 00:05:18,506
Min Yong, have you ever met Bo Mi before?

110
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:20,041
No. This is the first time.

111
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,509
(This is the first time.)

112
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:23,144
What?

113
00:05:23,911 --> 00:05:25,179
- Nice to meet you. - Are you serious?

114
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:28,850
Wouldn't "Flaming Youth" suit Min Yong better?

115
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:31,619
I'll appear on that one soon too.

116
00:05:31,619 --> 00:05:32,820
(He's set for that too.)

117
00:05:33,187 --> 00:05:35,423
- Really? - Are you serious?

118
00:05:35,423 --> 00:05:37,725
- He sounds like an old man. - He's like a hermit.

119
00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:40,228
- He lived in a mountain. - Really?

120
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:42,130
He was like this even when he was young.

121
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,801
I still look young. I've only just started.

122
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:51,005
I think it'll be an extraordinary episode.

123
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:52,807
Are we going to be divided into two teams?

124
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:56,177
The guests will be given...

125
00:05:56,177 --> 00:05:58,613
very useful hints for the final mission.

126
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:02,150
- Really? - The guests are given hints.

127
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,186
Let's play a game to decide the teams.

128
00:06:05,186 --> 00:06:09,724
The guests will eat something behind a blind. You have to guess...

129
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:12,627
- what they're eating. - Is that possible?

130
00:06:12,627 --> 00:06:15,329
- And the guest will be ours? - I love both.

131
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:16,998
Bo Mi loves food.

132
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:19,200
It's possible for one team to take both guests.

133
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,235
- Really? - Really?

134
00:06:21,235 --> 00:06:22,937
That's nice.

135
00:06:22,937 --> 00:06:24,172
(Which team will win?)

136
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:27,675
(Team Jae Seok and Team Jong Kook)

137
00:06:28,342 --> 00:06:31,412
Min Yong will go in...

138
00:06:31,412 --> 00:06:34,048
and eat the food.

139
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:36,417
The team that guesses it right will take him.

140
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:40,988
Min Yong's outfit is not appropriate for the show.

141
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:43,524
Min Yong, aren't your pants too short?

142
00:06:43,558 --> 00:06:44,992
- What? - Aren't your pants too short?

143
00:06:44,992 --> 00:06:47,295
- Aren't they shorts? - They're capri pants.

144
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:50,331
Park Jin Young wore them when he sang, "I Have a Girl".

145
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,433
Ready.

146
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:53,601
(The games starts.)

147
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:56,337
- I can see something. - I can't see anything.

148
00:06:57,138 --> 00:06:58,172
Oh, my.

149
00:06:58,973 --> 00:07:00,074
Oh, my.

150
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:02,443
- Is it something tasty? - It looks tasty.

151
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:04,412
Is it one of the dishes we tried?

152
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:07,415
This is too heavy to have in the morning.

153
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,686
(Gimbap)

154
00:07:12,887 --> 00:07:15,223
(With various kinds of vegetables, gimbap is very nutritious.)

155
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:18,059
I know what food he likes.

156
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:19,627
- Try it. - Try it.

157
00:07:19,627 --> 00:07:23,197
- It's very fresh. - Okay.

158
00:07:23,197 --> 00:07:26,434
You can find this at the fish market.

159
00:07:26,434 --> 00:07:27,902
(Gimbap at the fish market?)

160
00:07:27,902 --> 00:07:30,371
- Really? - It's lobster.

161
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:31,606
- Wrong. - It's crab.

162
00:07:31,706 --> 00:07:34,709
- Wrong. - It's seafood stew.

163
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:37,411
- What are you doing? - It's sashimi.

164
00:07:37,445 --> 00:07:39,881
- Wrong. - He's supposed to eat it.

165
00:07:39,881 --> 00:07:42,917
- You should show us. - Open your mouth.

166
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,219
- Open your mouth. - You should show us.

167
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:47,255
- Eat it. - Good.

168
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:48,256
(She continuously opens it.)

169
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:51,459
- Does it taste good? - His mouth is full.

170
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:54,228
It's very delicious.

171
00:07:54,228 --> 00:07:56,731
- It's absolutely delicious. - Ji Hyo, don't you see it?

172
00:07:56,731 --> 00:07:58,733
I can't see anything.

173
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:01,903
- Give me a piggyback. - Don't leave it open for too long.

174
00:08:01,903 --> 00:08:02,904
(Jae Seok is on Seok Jin's back.)

175
00:08:03,204 --> 00:08:06,440
- At the Grand Canyon, - Grand Canyon?

176
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,911
- I ate this on the trail. - I've never been there.

177
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:13,014
- Grand Canyon? - Show us the food.

178
00:08:13,014 --> 00:08:14,715
I'm eating it right now.

179
00:08:14,715 --> 00:08:17,785
- How much does it cost? - What?

180
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:19,053
Whatever you call is the price.

181
00:08:19,053 --> 00:08:20,988
- I know. - The price must fluctuate.

182
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:22,056
What do you mean the price is up to the seller?

183
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,091
It's steamed snow crab.

184
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:25,793
(Your answer is far off.)

185
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:27,561
- Haha, you're wrong. - I have the answer!

186
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:29,563
It's ray sea bream.

187
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:31,399
- What? - What did you say?

188
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,701
There's no such fish named that. You meant black sea bream.

189
00:08:33,968 --> 00:08:36,203
- It's black sea bream. - Let him have it.

190
00:08:36,203 --> 00:08:37,672
- The answer is black sea bream. - Hey.

191
00:08:37,672 --> 00:08:39,974
- How could you say that? - The answer is shark's fin.

192
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:42,043
- Shark's fin? - Yes, it's shark's fin.

193
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:43,311
(They are far from the correct answer.)

194
00:08:43,311 --> 00:08:46,047
In fact, you can consider this to be one of our national food.

195
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:48,482
- Really? - His mouth is full with that food.

196
00:08:48,716 --> 00:08:49,951
The answer is gimbap.

197
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:52,119
- That's correct. - Is it really gimbap?

198
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:53,955
(Kwang Soo gets the right answer.)

199
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:56,057
You're telling me that people sell gimbap at Grand Canyon?

200
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,326
- Seriously? - How did you know it was gimbap?

201
00:08:58,326 --> 00:09:00,494
- You said it's from a fish market! - How did you figure it out?

202
00:09:01,395 --> 00:09:03,197
- Yes! - No way.

203
00:09:03,197 --> 00:09:04,432
(The answer is gimbap.)

204
00:09:04,432 --> 00:09:06,467
- The red thing was carrot. - I see.

205
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:08,402
- It was gimbap. - I can't believe it.

206
00:09:08,402 --> 00:09:11,005
- I did have gimbap at Grand Canyon. - Really?

207
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:14,041
Min Yong, you can join Team Jong Kook.

208
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:17,778
(Min Yong joins Team Jong Kook after all.)

209
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:19,580
- I feel like I just got an old man. - We should've gotten him.

210
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,983
- We were supposed to recruit him. - Right. We were supposed to.

211
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,751
Can we take the guest from the other team?

212
00:09:23,751 --> 00:09:25,252
- We have to bring Bo Mi now. - That's right.

213
00:09:25,252 --> 00:09:26,687
- We can also recruit Bo Mi too. - The second...

214
00:09:26,687 --> 00:09:28,089
- Hey, we ought to bring Bo Mi. - You shouldn't be so greedy.

215
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:30,958
Jae Seok. We must recruit Bo Mi. We really have to get her.

216
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,260
- We have to get this one right. - Let's do this.

217
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,528
- Let's get this right. - All right.

218
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:39,333
Please reveal the second dish that Bo Mi will eat.

219
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:42,303
- Bo Mi. - Let us see your reaction to it.

220
00:09:42,303 --> 00:09:43,838
- Bo Mi. - This looks delicious.

221
00:09:43,838 --> 00:09:45,006
- Talk to us. - Stay quiet.

222
00:09:45,006 --> 00:09:46,474
- If you join Jong Kook's team... - You must join our team, Bo Mi.

223
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:48,676
- I haven't had this for a while. - What?

224
00:09:48,676 --> 00:09:50,611
- Really? - Do you like this dish?

225
00:09:50,678 --> 00:09:53,347
- Min Yong, let us see her. - Do female idol singers eat that?

226
00:09:53,447 --> 00:09:54,882
- Who? - Female idol singers.

227
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:56,617
- Can they eat that? - Well...

228
00:09:56,617 --> 00:09:57,918
It must be this if she hasn't had if for a while.

229
00:09:57,918 --> 00:10:00,721
- I haven't had this for a while. - This isn't on her diet then.

230
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:04,592
You can eat this with your hands.

231
00:10:04,592 --> 00:10:05,860
It's similar to Indian food.

232
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:10,131
- There he goes again. - He's lying again.

233
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:11,499
Why are you lying?

234
00:10:11,632 --> 00:10:13,334
I had this in Mumbai.

235
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:14,301
Min Yong. Let us see her a bit.

236
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:16,103
- A bit more. - This is your hint.

237
00:10:16,203 --> 00:10:18,072
I will give you another hint.

238
00:10:18,572 --> 00:10:19,974
It's called white food.

239
00:10:19,974 --> 00:10:21,609
- What did you say? - I said this is white food.

240
00:10:21,609 --> 00:10:24,178
- Did you say "white" or "fight"? - I said "white".

241
00:10:24,178 --> 00:10:25,279
I have the answer!

242
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,781
- It's dumpling. - That's incorrect.

243
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:28,682
- He said it's white. - That was close.

244
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:29,950
- I have the answer! - I got it!

245
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,118
- I yelled first. - It's dim sum.

246
00:10:31,385 --> 00:10:32,453
- Goodness. - Dim sum.

247
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:34,855
- He said it first. - Yes!

248
00:10:34,855 --> 00:10:36,023
What is your answer, Haha?

249
00:10:36,023 --> 00:10:38,626
- It's dim sum. - It wasn't his turn.

250
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:39,627
It was my turn.

251
00:10:39,627 --> 00:10:41,962
- He said it first. - The answer is dim sum.

252
00:10:41,962 --> 00:10:44,231
- It's dim sum. - No, Haha yelled out first.

253
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:46,634
- I really did call out first. - It's spelled...

254
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:49,837
(You're so greedy. Why are you doing this to us?)

255
00:10:49,837 --> 00:10:52,206
- Do rock-paper-scissors to settle. - He said, "dim sum".

256
00:10:52,206 --> 00:10:53,474
- He said, "dim sum". - All right. Then...

257
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:55,776
- Let's do rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors?

258
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:57,611
- The winning team can answer first. - But we were first.

259
00:10:58,446 --> 00:11:00,247
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

260
00:11:00,247 --> 00:11:01,849
- Rock-paper-scissors. - All right. He won.

261
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:03,317
- Rock-paper-scissors. - I lost.

262
00:11:03,484 --> 00:11:04,919
- Rock-paper-scissors. - I won!

263
00:11:05,352 --> 00:11:06,654
What is the answer?

264
00:11:06,654 --> 00:11:09,423
(Seok Jin earns the opportunity to say his answer first.)

265
00:11:09,423 --> 00:11:10,791
- It's dim sum. - That's incorrect.

266
00:11:11,392 --> 00:11:12,827
(Incorrect!)

267
00:11:12,827 --> 00:11:14,795
What are you doing? It's not dim sum?

268
00:11:14,795 --> 00:11:16,097
(It wasn't correct?)

269
00:11:16,097 --> 00:11:18,332
- What did you say? - What did you make us play then?

270
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:20,134
- Hey. - He's doing his job well.

271
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:22,203
Why did you do that? I'm so annoyed.

272
00:11:23,003 --> 00:11:25,439
Pulling pranks is my area of expertise.

273
00:11:25,706 --> 00:11:28,542
- You're making me mad. - I will give you a crucial hint.

274
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,078
There are two kinds of this food.

275
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,814
You have to be fast for this.

276
00:11:34,448 --> 00:11:36,684
- Fertilized and unfertilized. - I have the answer!

277
00:11:36,784 --> 00:11:38,319
I know the answer! I got it.

278
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:39,587
- I figured it out. - What is it?

279
00:11:39,587 --> 00:11:40,654
Be quiet.

280
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,591
What are you doing?

281
00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:45,025
- Stop that. - Go over there.

282
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,261
- Why? Tell us. - Go and stay there.

283
00:11:47,428 --> 00:11:48,729
- Tell us the answer. - What is it?

284
00:11:48,729 --> 00:11:50,164
- What is the answer? - Get lost.

285
00:11:50,164 --> 00:11:51,332
It's boiled egg.

286
00:11:51,332 --> 00:11:53,834
(Ji Hyo's answer is boiled egg.)

287
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:54,935
That's correct!

288
00:11:54,935 --> 00:11:56,036
(Ji Hyo gets it right.)

289
00:11:56,036 --> 00:11:58,405
- That's it. Bo Mi. Come to us. - Come on.

290
00:11:58,405 --> 00:12:00,341
Why would you eat this in Mumbai though?

291
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,377
- Boiled eggs are sold in India too. - Let's switch.

292
00:12:03,777 --> 00:12:06,113
- Is there a chance to switch him? - In Mumbai...

293
00:12:06,113 --> 00:12:07,515
Can you give us a chance to switch him out?

294
00:12:07,515 --> 00:12:09,016
- Let us switch. - Please let us!

295
00:12:09,016 --> 00:12:10,317
- No, you can't! - I can't work with him.

296
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:11,619
I'm not going to be in this then!

297
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:14,855
- Let us change the guests. - He's really unhappy about that.

298
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:16,590
- Let us switch. - You can't do that.

299
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,192
- I can't work with him. - It's not that we don't like him.

300
00:12:18,192 --> 00:12:19,593
- We just want to work with Bo Mi. - If you insist...

301
00:12:19,693 --> 00:12:21,395
- You can't do that. - What about us then?

302
00:12:21,395 --> 00:12:24,131
- I'm begging you. Just this once. - I won't work if you don't let us!

303
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:26,233
- I will take care of Jong Kook. - We are happy with Bo Mi.

304
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:29,003
- I will do whatever you want. - We are happy with Bo Mi.

305
00:12:29,003 --> 00:12:31,071
How can I handle Jong Kook and Min Yong together?

306
00:12:31,405 --> 00:12:33,440
- Switch guests! - This isn't right.

307
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:35,943
- We like Min Yong. - Right. Min Yong is great.

308
00:12:36,177 --> 00:12:38,846
- How about this? Let's do this. - All right.

309
00:12:38,846 --> 00:12:40,848
- Let Bo Mi choose her team. - Right. Let her pick.

310
00:12:40,848 --> 00:12:42,917
- She can join the team she wants. - All right.

311
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:45,586
Will she want a younger or older team?

312
00:12:46,353 --> 00:12:47,454
Can we do that?

313
00:12:47,454 --> 00:12:49,123
(Bo Mi, join the younger team.)

314
00:12:49,123 --> 00:12:50,624
What do you want to do?

315
00:12:50,624 --> 00:12:51,892
- Choose one team. - Well...

316
00:12:51,892 --> 00:12:54,595
- Bo Mi. Do you want to stay or go? - We starred on a show together.

317
00:12:54,595 --> 00:12:56,797
- Bo Mi. - We have our own chat room.

318
00:12:56,797 --> 00:12:59,133
- We really do, Bo Mi. - Which team do you want?

319
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:00,901
- Me? - Bo Mi, everyone here is young.

320
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:02,836
- I like both teams. - All right.

321
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:04,605
- Come to our team, Bo Mi! - Will you be okay?

322
00:13:04,805 --> 00:13:07,141
- Bo Mi! - I'll switch since they're younger.

323
00:13:07,141 --> 00:13:08,909
That's right!

324
00:13:10,177 --> 00:13:11,579
(They complete trading the guests.)

325
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:14,615
- Come here. - Welcome, Min Yong.

326
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:16,450
(Laughing)

327
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,052
It doesn't matter if we lose now.

328
00:13:18,052 --> 00:13:19,220
That's it.

329
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,157
In our team, you can play the role of Kwang Soo.

330
00:13:23,424 --> 00:13:25,125
- Did you get that? - You are tall too.

331
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:26,594
- And... - He's tall too.

332
00:13:26,594 --> 00:13:28,829
- Ji Hyo can play Bo Mi's role. - I'm excited.

333
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:30,631
Just because I'm tall, I don't act like him.

334
00:13:30,631 --> 00:13:31,632
"Like him"?

335
00:13:31,832 --> 00:13:33,901
- What do you mean by that? - He's complicated.

336
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:35,703
(Being tall and unlucky at the same time is complicated.)

337
00:13:35,703 --> 00:13:37,204
- Unbelievable. - He's tall indeed.

338
00:13:37,204 --> 00:13:41,442
Today, you'll visit restaurants recommended by the members.

339
00:13:41,609 --> 00:13:44,211
You will have to unravel the secrets along the way.

340
00:13:44,812 --> 00:13:48,549
A team game will decide the winning and losing team at each restaurant.

341
00:13:48,716 --> 00:13:53,387
The winning team will earn benefits as well as hints.

342
00:13:53,387 --> 00:13:57,358
We will start "Running Man's Food Guide" now. Let us begin!

343
00:13:57,358 --> 00:13:59,093
(They set out to dig up the secrets.)

344
00:14:00,828 --> 00:14:02,029
This is nice.

345
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:04,231
(They'll try braised spicy chicken, small octopus, eel, and bulgogi.)

346
00:14:04,798 --> 00:14:06,100
What should we eat first?

347
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,403
- I picked this restaurant. - Where?

348
00:14:09,403 --> 00:14:12,539
- Is this one in Samseong-dong? - It's bulgogi.

349
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:15,042
This is bulgogi, but this isn't your regular bulgogi.

350
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:16,443
(It's a classy transformation of bulgogi.)

351
00:14:16,443 --> 00:14:18,112
We can grill it on this.

352
00:14:18,112 --> 00:14:20,347
This is similar to shabu shabu.

353
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:21,849
Look. That looks delicious.

354
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:23,517
- This looks tasty. - Bulgogi...

355
00:14:25,185 --> 00:14:28,622
Kwang Soo often goes to this restaurant.

356
00:14:28,622 --> 00:14:31,492
- He takes girls there on a date. - Look at that.

357
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:33,127
- That's how he knows... - What are you saying?

358
00:14:33,193 --> 00:14:34,695
- a lot of good restaurants. - No, I just like delicious food.

359
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:37,131
The girls who went there with him must feel betrayed...

360
00:14:37,131 --> 00:14:39,600
- What are you saying? - when they watch this.

361
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,803
- How many girls did you take there? - I bet there are at least four...

362
00:14:42,803 --> 00:14:47,508
- girls who went there with him. - It's not true. Don't be mistaken.

363
00:14:47,508 --> 00:14:50,611
- Don't be mistaken. - I got my hair done at a salon.

364
00:14:50,911 --> 00:14:52,079
What?

365
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,814
(What did you say that out of the blue?)

366
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:55,416
- I mean... - Let me tell you about him.

367
00:14:55,482 --> 00:14:58,052
- He only thinks about himself. - He was touching my hair.

368
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:01,855
- Does he have his own show? - He only thinks about himself.

369
00:15:01,855 --> 00:15:04,992
This camera is filming Bo Mi and me together.

370
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,294
I thought we could have our own conversation.

371
00:15:07,561 --> 00:15:11,632
I haven't seen anyone pull up the collar since my school teacher.

372
00:15:11,832 --> 00:15:13,500
Really. Not that many people do this.

373
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,103
People pull up their collar not to get the back of their neck tanned.

374
00:15:16,203 --> 00:15:17,938
That's why gym teachers do this...

375
00:15:17,938 --> 00:15:19,740
- since they stay outdoor a lot. - He even curled it a bit.

376
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,743
- He was a gym teacher on a sitcom. - There's a reason why we have this.

377
00:15:22,743 --> 00:15:24,945
He does look like a PE teacher though.

378
00:15:24,945 --> 00:15:26,747
- He played a role of a gym teacher. - Right, he does look like one.

379
00:15:26,747 --> 00:15:29,316
- I can't stop playing that role. - He was...

380
00:15:29,383 --> 00:15:31,452
You can't stop playing it? Stop exaggerating.

381
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:32,886
He's still in the process of assimilating into the present.

382
00:15:32,886 --> 00:15:34,054
(They are on the way to the first course.)

383
00:15:35,055 --> 00:15:37,391
(Kwang Soo's choice in Samseong-dong, Gangnam)

384
00:15:37,391 --> 00:15:40,094
- Hello. - Hi.

385
00:15:40,094 --> 00:15:41,228
- Look at this. - Hello.

386
00:15:41,228 --> 00:15:43,130
(It's the perfect pair of vegetables and beef.)

387
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,032
- Hello. - This is similar to shabu shabu.

388
00:15:45,432 --> 00:15:46,934
- This is shabu shabu. - Goodness.

389
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:48,302
- What is this? - This looks great.

390
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:49,503
(The first restaurant of the tour guide)

391
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,038
- It's bulgogi. - This looks delicious.

392
00:15:51,038 --> 00:15:52,406
- This bulgogi looks different. - It will be so tasty.

393
00:15:52,406 --> 00:15:55,476
- They won't give it to all of us. - Is that it?

394
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:58,445
The first restaurant of "Running Man's Food Guide" is...

395
00:15:59,113 --> 00:16:01,081
a bulgogi stew restaurant...

396
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:03,884
- recommended by Kwang Soo. - This is excellent.

397
00:16:03,884 --> 00:16:07,888
It is the restaurant that Kwang Soo came with the lady he was dating.

398
00:16:07,888 --> 00:16:09,990
No, it's not true. I didn't.

399
00:16:10,391 --> 00:16:12,126
- The owner will know. - It's not that.

400
00:16:12,126 --> 00:16:14,395
This place is famous for beef soup...

401
00:16:14,395 --> 00:16:16,397
- and bulgogi as well. - Beef soup?

402
00:16:16,663 --> 00:16:18,832
The bulgogi meat is like a round ball.

403
00:16:18,932 --> 00:16:20,701
I think this is very unique.

404
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:22,302
You can pop it into your mouth at once.

405
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:23,937
I am going to be impartial when I review the food.

406
00:16:23,937 --> 00:16:25,339
I'm confident about the food.

407
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:29,243
The winning team of the game will only...

408
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,578
(Only the winning team will eat.)

409
00:16:31,578 --> 00:16:33,547
eat the food.

410
00:16:34,448 --> 00:16:36,550
The game you will play at this restaurant is...

411
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,255
that I will show you an enlarged picture of a dish...

412
00:16:41,255 --> 00:16:44,024
- We have to guess the dish, right? - Right. You have to guess it.

413
00:16:44,057 --> 00:16:45,058
- It's a dish? - Yes.

414
00:16:45,058 --> 00:16:46,326
- It won't be easy. - I am an expert.

415
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:49,229
There is a special buzzer for this game.

416
00:16:49,596 --> 00:16:53,100
To ring the buzzer, you have to get the other team to talk.

417
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,636
(The buzzer is the opponent's voice.)

418
00:16:55,636 --> 00:16:56,837
Can I hit their vocal cord?

419
00:16:57,404 --> 00:16:58,572
How could you say that?

420
00:16:58,572 --> 00:17:01,008
The opponent's voice will be the buzzer.

421
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:04,945
(The team that wins 2 rounds out of 3 will win the game.)

422
00:17:04,945 --> 00:17:07,948
Please select one player from each team.

423
00:17:07,948 --> 00:17:09,049
Whom should we pick?

424
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:11,318
We must show our strength in the first round. You must play.

425
00:17:11,485 --> 00:17:12,920
- No. - Should Bo Mi go first?

426
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,221
- Me? - Why don't you go first, Bo Mi?

427
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:15,222
Bo Mi is first?

428
00:17:15,222 --> 00:17:16,323
(Bo Mi will play first.)

429
00:17:16,623 --> 00:17:18,025
Then Seok Jin will play.

430
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:20,427
- Seriously? - Why are you doing that to us?

431
00:17:20,427 --> 00:17:22,663
- He doesn't go easy on women. - I won't go easy on you.

432
00:17:22,663 --> 00:17:24,231
- It's so big. - He only...

433
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:26,700
- He only cares about winning. - I won't go easy on you.

434
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,902
I don't know anything about Apink.

435
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:31,438
(Round 1, Bo Mi versus Seok Jin)

436
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:33,774
- Here is the first question. - All right.

437
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:38,178
(What is this dish?)

438
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:40,914
- What is this? - Can't you recognize it right away?

439
00:17:41,014 --> 00:17:42,583
(What is that red thing?)

440
00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:44,218
- Shall I give you a hint? - Please do so.

441
00:17:44,718 --> 00:17:46,687
The hint is kimchi.

442
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:50,824
- Get ready. - There are a lot of sesame.

443
00:17:50,824 --> 00:17:52,092
- Start! - Really?

444
00:17:52,092 --> 00:17:53,460
(Pinching hard)

445
00:17:54,995 --> 00:17:56,396
(Their passion to ring the buzzer is tremendous.)

446
00:17:56,396 --> 00:17:57,898
Look. Seok Jin is clenching his teeth.

447
00:17:58,899 --> 00:18:01,201
(Pulling)

448
00:18:02,402 --> 00:18:06,340
(They will answer the question first when the opponent makes a sound.)

449
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,275
- Bo Mi is really trying too. - She is.

450
00:18:08,275 --> 00:18:09,576
Both of them are playing this wholeheartedly.

451
00:18:09,576 --> 00:18:10,744
Bo Mi is no joke too.

452
00:18:10,777 --> 00:18:12,212
(She doesn't go easy on him.)

453
00:18:12,246 --> 00:18:13,580
(Pinching)

454
00:18:14,848 --> 00:18:17,651
(He targets her lower jaw which is her weak spot.)

455
00:18:17,784 --> 00:18:19,286
Bo Mi, show your taekwondo moves.

456
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:20,754
Bo Mi, kick him!

457
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:22,723
- Kick him. - That's right.

458
00:18:22,723 --> 00:18:24,525
Attack him.

459
00:18:24,825 --> 00:18:26,226
(They struggle.)

460
00:18:26,226 --> 00:18:27,327
(Let go of my hair.)

461
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:31,431
(She pulls out a chunk of his hair.)

462
00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:34,801
(Each strand of hair is precious at his age.)

463
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:36,236
Bo Mi pulled out his hair.

464
00:18:37,538 --> 00:18:39,873
(Seok Jin cries without a sound.)

465
00:18:39,873 --> 00:18:41,675
What happened?

466
00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:43,377
- You pulled out so much. - Bo Mi.

467
00:18:43,443 --> 00:18:45,412
(It's not like she can implant the hair back.)

468
00:18:45,412 --> 00:18:48,048
Go and wash your hands. What's this?

469
00:18:48,482 --> 00:18:50,851
(Seok Jin can't take back his hair.)

470
00:18:51,351 --> 00:18:52,586
- Bo Mi's hands are dirty. - Bo Mi.

471
00:18:52,586 --> 00:18:54,922
- Her hands are dirty. - That's a lot of hair.

472
00:18:55,556 --> 00:18:57,491
(Her hands are dirty.)

473
00:18:57,491 --> 00:18:59,059
Go and wash your hands.

474
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:00,928
- Use wet tissue. - Do you have wet tissue?

475
00:19:00,928 --> 00:19:02,863
- Did her hands get dirty? - Yes.

476
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:06,333
(She exposed his scalp by force.)

477
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,701
(I still didn't make any sound.)

478
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:10,737
- Bo Mi, use taekwondo. - Kick him.

479
00:19:10,737 --> 00:19:11,939
Just kick him.

480
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:13,974
You can do it, Bo Mi.

481
00:19:13,974 --> 00:19:15,642
- Let's take turns. - Take turns?

482
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:18,211
- You can do it, Bo Mi. - Let's take turns.

483
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:19,880
- Okay. - Take turns in hitting.

484
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,214
(Don't worry.)

485
00:19:21,315 --> 00:19:23,917
- Okay. - What?

486
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:25,619
(She kicks him hard.)

487
00:19:26,653 --> 00:19:30,524
(She attacks him with her leg.)

488
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:35,429
(Everyone gives a standing ovation.)

489
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:37,197
(He's completely embarrassed.)

490
00:19:37,197 --> 00:19:39,633
Bo Mi gets her turn first.

491
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,168
- She goes first. - Good job.

492
00:19:41,168 --> 00:19:44,004
(Bo Mi is good at taekwondo.)

493
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:46,473
(They all feel pity on him.)

494
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:48,609
- She goes first. - Good job.

495
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:50,477
(Seok Jin loses.)

496
00:19:50,577 --> 00:19:52,512
She's good at kicking.

497
00:19:52,512 --> 00:19:54,381
- Go ahead. - She's charming.

498
00:19:54,381 --> 00:19:56,416
- Go, Bo Mi. - She's awesome.

499
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,285
(He gives in.)

500
00:19:58,552 --> 00:20:00,287
- It's Bo Mi's turn. - Go ahead.

501
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:02,389
It's your turn, Bo Mi.

502
00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:03,457
(What could it be?)

503
00:20:03,457 --> 00:20:06,159
- Do you know the answer? - In 5, 4...

504
00:20:07,427 --> 00:20:09,463
Kimchi is the hint.

505
00:20:09,463 --> 00:20:13,500
(It's a dish made with kimchi.)

506
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,835
It's kimchi jeon.

507
00:20:15,802 --> 00:20:20,173
(Is it a photo of kimchi jeon?)

508
00:20:20,173 --> 00:20:21,341
That's correct.

509
00:20:21,341 --> 00:20:23,276
(Bo Mi is correct.)

510
00:20:23,276 --> 00:20:24,645
Is that kimchi jeon?

511
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,246
Good job.

512
00:20:26,246 --> 00:20:28,181
- Really? - It's kimchi jeon.

513
00:20:28,181 --> 00:20:29,583
- Right. - It looks like stew.

514
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,385
- Bo Mi. - It's oily.

515
00:20:31,385 --> 00:20:32,653
- Are you okay? - Yes.

516
00:20:32,653 --> 00:20:34,688
Are you sure? I'm sorry.

517
00:20:34,688 --> 00:20:36,089
Next up is Min Yong.

518
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,325
- I'm okay. - Come on, Min Yong.

519
00:20:38,392 --> 00:20:39,559
Haha is up next.

520
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:41,728
(It's a match between Min Yong and Haha.)

521
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:45,332
(Round 2, Haha versus Min Yong)

522
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:46,733
Here's the photo.

523
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:48,402
(It's the second question.)

524
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:51,805
(What kind of dish is this?)

525
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:53,306
Hey.

526
00:20:53,306 --> 00:20:54,374
(He reaches out.)

527
00:20:54,374 --> 00:20:57,177
(Haha suddenly attacks Min Yong's private part.)

528
00:20:57,978 --> 00:20:59,279
What are you doing?

529
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:01,515
(The two old men play like children.)

530
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:02,949
What are you doing?

531
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:05,852
It'll be blurred on TV.

532
00:21:05,852 --> 00:21:07,154
(They can't help but look.)

533
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:10,190
(He locks his head angrily.)

534
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,558
(Haha laughs.)

535
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:13,593
- Haha made a sound. - I heard it.

536
00:21:13,593 --> 00:21:14,928
It's Min Yong's turn.

537
00:21:14,928 --> 00:21:16,263
I endured it for too long.

538
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,998
My goodness.

539
00:21:17,998 --> 00:21:19,199
Go ahead, Min Yong.

540
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:21,301
(His best friend has given him unspeakable pain.)

541
00:21:21,301 --> 00:21:23,003
How could he endure that?

542
00:21:23,403 --> 00:21:24,805
Min Yong, are you okay?

543
00:21:24,905 --> 00:21:27,607
(He doesn't know how to explain the pain he's in.)

544
00:21:27,641 --> 00:21:29,443
- Are you okay? - Min Yong.

545
00:21:29,443 --> 00:21:31,344
- Min Yong, are you okay? - How did you endure it?

546
00:21:31,344 --> 00:21:33,346
It looked too painful to stay silent.

547
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:36,083
Are you okay? You look pale.

548
00:21:36,516 --> 00:21:38,285
I'm not even married yet.

549
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:41,221
Gosh, how did he endure the pain?

550
00:21:42,656 --> 00:21:43,924
I pinched it hard.

551
00:21:44,691 --> 00:21:45,859
You look exactly like your mother.

552
00:21:46,593 --> 00:21:48,462
Long time no see.

553
00:21:48,628 --> 00:21:50,831
- I hope all goes well. - Ma'am?

554
00:21:51,031 --> 00:21:52,499
You look exactly like her.

555
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:54,301
(Min Yong gets his turn.)

556
00:21:54,301 --> 00:21:56,236
- What's the answer? - Let me take a break.

557
00:21:56,636 --> 00:21:58,805
- I can't calm down. - Go.

558
00:21:59,072 --> 00:22:00,874
- Just answer it. - I almost got it.

559
00:22:00,874 --> 00:22:01,908
That's easy.

560
00:22:01,908 --> 00:22:04,644
- My answer is raw octopus. - That's right.

561
00:22:04,644 --> 00:22:05,879
- Raw octopus? - Yes.

562
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:07,547
(Is it correct?)

563
00:22:07,547 --> 00:22:08,715
(He's correct.)

564
00:22:08,715 --> 00:22:09,816
That's correct.

565
00:22:10,484 --> 00:22:11,685
- That was easy. - It was.

566
00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:13,220
It was too easy.

567
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,323
- It's too bad. - The answer was obvious.

568
00:22:16,323 --> 00:22:17,791
Are you okay?

569
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:19,726
I need to use the restroom.

570
00:22:19,726 --> 00:22:21,561
- Are you bleeding? - I think so.

571
00:22:21,561 --> 00:22:23,330
(It feels warm in his pants.)

572
00:22:23,897 --> 00:22:26,333
(Next is Jong Kook versus Jae Seok.)

573
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:28,935
- Jae Seok. - This is the final round.

574
00:22:29,035 --> 00:22:30,704
- Is it the final round? - You can do it.

575
00:22:30,804 --> 00:22:32,105
I bet it'll be difficult.

576
00:22:32,706 --> 00:22:33,774
Here's the photo.

577
00:22:33,774 --> 00:22:34,841
(It's the third question.)

578
00:22:34,841 --> 00:22:38,411
(What kind of dish is this?)

579
00:22:38,945 --> 00:22:40,180
(Jae Seok attacks.)

580
00:22:41,014 --> 00:22:42,916
(He bites.)

581
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,153
(Jong Kook starts to warm up.)

582
00:22:46,153 --> 00:22:47,154
He's in trouble.

583
00:22:47,154 --> 00:22:48,655
(Jong Kook throws him.)

584
00:22:48,655 --> 00:22:49,990
- The real fight starts now. - Hey.

585
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,158
He made a sound.

586
00:22:51,224 --> 00:22:53,326
Come on. You can't do this.

587
00:22:53,493 --> 00:22:55,495
He can't throw me against the wall.

588
00:22:55,662 --> 00:22:56,763
What is it?

589
00:22:56,763 --> 00:22:58,231
Aren't they rice cakes?

590
00:22:58,431 --> 00:23:00,734
(Can they be rice cakes?)

591
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:02,903
It's incorrect.

592
00:23:03,403 --> 00:23:04,838
(Jae Seok is happy.)

593
00:23:05,972 --> 00:23:07,841
(Did you step on my foot?)

594
00:23:07,841 --> 00:23:09,409
(He laughs out loud.)

595
00:23:10,443 --> 00:23:12,846
(Jong Kook gets his turn again.)

596
00:23:12,946 --> 00:23:14,281
Gosh, I don't believe it.

597
00:23:14,281 --> 00:23:16,116
(What could it be?)

598
00:23:16,516 --> 00:23:18,819
Just answer it since it'll always be your turn.

599
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:20,353
- That's right. - This is annoying.

600
00:23:20,353 --> 00:23:23,190
Is it mandu?

601
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,159
(It's something white and mysterious.)

602
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,663
(Can it be mandu instead of rice cakes?)

603
00:23:29,663 --> 00:23:31,131
- That's correct. - What?

604
00:23:31,198 --> 00:23:32,232
(Jong Kook gets it right.)

605
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:34,501
- How can it be mandu? - We won.

606
00:23:34,501 --> 00:23:36,703
(Jong Kook answers the most difficult question.)

607
00:23:36,837 --> 00:23:38,038
- It's mandu. - Goodness.

608
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:39,906
- We won. - It's obviously mandu.

609
00:23:39,906 --> 00:23:41,441
I thought it was rice.

610
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:42,576
(This is the actual photo.)

611
00:23:42,976 --> 00:23:45,478
(Jong Kook's team gets to taste the bulgogi.)

612
00:23:45,478 --> 00:23:46,880
- Shall we start? - Is it ready to eat?

613
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,849
- Yes. - Thank you.

614
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:51,751
(Boiling broth and moist meat create the best harmony.)

615
00:23:51,751 --> 00:23:53,486
That's how you eat it.

616
00:23:54,287 --> 00:23:55,822
It's quite unique.

617
00:23:55,822 --> 00:23:58,325
(What's the secret hidden in this dish?)

618
00:23:59,192 --> 00:24:00,694
(Blowing)

619
00:24:00,694 --> 00:24:01,828
(She opens her mouth wide.)

620
00:24:01,828 --> 00:24:03,730
Don't pretend to be considerate.

621
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,932
- Thank you. - Help yourselves.

622
00:24:05,932 --> 00:24:07,100
(Isn't it delicious?)

623
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,401
Is that rice?

624
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:10,637
(He tastes some seasoned raw beef.)

625
00:24:10,637 --> 00:24:11,905
It's really delicious.

626
00:24:11,905 --> 00:24:14,507
Don't be disappointed that you can't eat it.

627
00:24:14,507 --> 00:24:15,909
(He makes fun of the others.)

628
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:17,878
My goodness.

629
00:24:18,144 --> 00:24:19,212
Gosh.

630
00:24:19,212 --> 00:24:20,714
(Is it delicious?)

631
00:24:20,714 --> 00:24:22,048
It smells so good.

632
00:24:22,282 --> 00:24:23,450
Here you go.

633
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,684
What's this?

634
00:24:24,784 --> 00:24:26,453
It's an avocado.

635
00:24:26,453 --> 00:24:27,520
Isn't that an avocado?

636
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,890
(Why is there an avocado?)

637
00:24:30,223 --> 00:24:32,158
- Do we share it? - Yes.

638
00:24:32,192 --> 00:24:33,860
Take a bite each.

639
00:24:34,261 --> 00:24:36,496
It's like butter from a tree.

640
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,098
- Is that so? - Yes.

641
00:24:38,098 --> 00:24:41,201
(Avocado is a soft fruit with a lot of vitamins.)

642
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:46,606
(They can't help but look at the bulgogi.)

643
00:24:47,607 --> 00:24:52,279
May I get a bite after Bo Mi kicks me again?

644
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:54,447
Sure, go ahead.

645
00:24:54,814 --> 00:24:56,850
(Do I have to kick him again?)

646
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,652
Jae Seok, take a bite.

647
00:24:58,652 --> 00:25:01,254
(He offers a bite to Jae Seok.)

648
00:25:01,788 --> 00:25:05,558
(Her kick could even break your leg.)

649
00:25:05,558 --> 00:25:06,593
Bo Mi.

650
00:25:07,694 --> 00:25:13,033
(Is getting a kick worth it to taste some bulgogi?)

651
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:15,702
You can get two pieces.

652
00:25:15,702 --> 00:25:17,237
Really? That sounds good.

653
00:25:17,237 --> 00:25:18,972
(Everyone wants to get kicked.)

654
00:25:19,572 --> 00:25:20,807
What are you doing?

655
00:25:20,807 --> 00:25:23,710
My legs can't function properly today anyway.

656
00:25:23,777 --> 00:25:25,679
(He's already given up on his lower body.)

657
00:25:25,979 --> 00:25:27,414
You'll find out after getting kicked.

658
00:25:27,714 --> 00:25:30,016
Do you promise to give us two pieces?

659
00:25:30,016 --> 00:25:31,418
- How about this side? - Yes, two pieces.

660
00:25:31,418 --> 00:25:32,519
She's smart.

661
00:25:32,686 --> 00:25:34,020
(She takes her pose.)

662
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,522
I have red belt in taekwondo.

663
00:25:36,489 --> 00:25:38,658
(She kicks.)

664
00:25:38,692 --> 00:25:41,695
(She kicks him hard.)

665
00:25:42,729 --> 00:25:46,833
(Min Yong's determination for bulgogi deserves respect.)

666
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,703
- I'm really sorry. - Min Yong is in pain.

667
00:25:49,703 --> 00:25:51,004
You can eat now.

668
00:25:51,004 --> 00:25:52,939
- Bo Mi can kick. - Please eat.

669
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,708
Think about something else.

670
00:25:54,874 --> 00:25:56,443
Bo Mi's kicks are impressive.

671
00:25:56,443 --> 00:25:58,178
Jae Seok seems nervous.

672
00:25:58,178 --> 00:26:00,547
- To be honest, I'm scared. - Go ahead.

673
00:26:00,947 --> 00:26:02,515
- He looks scared. - Try it.

674
00:26:02,515 --> 00:26:03,750
She moves forward as she kicks.

675
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,786
(Thud)

676
00:26:07,954 --> 00:26:12,492
(Enjoy your bulgogi.)

677
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:15,695
(He lies down immediately.)

678
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:17,230
(He trembles in pain.)

679
00:26:18,298 --> 00:26:20,233
(He feels it in his whole body.)

680
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:22,435
Good job, Bo Mi.

681
00:26:24,037 --> 00:26:26,673
I'll eat Jae Seok's bulgogi.

682
00:26:28,908 --> 00:26:29,976
Goodness.

683
00:26:29,976 --> 00:26:31,277
(Isn't that mine?)

684
00:26:31,277 --> 00:26:33,079
- Why are you eating mine? - It's gone.

685
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:34,314
Why are you eating?

686
00:26:34,314 --> 00:26:36,850
(You can't taste this bulgogi anywhere else.)

687
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,619
Team Jong Kook wins the first round.

688
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:40,620
(Team Jong Kook wins.)

689
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,057
Here are the two items related to Food Guide's secret.

690
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,159
You ate rice and barley.

691
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,594
Here are rice and barley.

692
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:49,662
Are these hints?

693
00:26:49,863 --> 00:26:51,698
Team Jae Seok lost.

694
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:53,433
- You had an avocado. - Yes.

695
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:54,834
Here's another avocado.

696
00:26:54,934 --> 00:26:56,903
- The number of items is important. - Really?

697
00:26:57,303 --> 00:27:00,040
(Is the number of items important?)

698
00:27:00,707 --> 00:27:03,777
(Team Jae Seok gets an avocado. Team Jong Kook gets rice and barley.)

699
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,011
Bo Mi.

700
00:27:05,211 --> 00:27:07,247
You must be feeling good since you ate tasty food and relieved stress.

701
00:27:07,247 --> 00:27:09,482
- Yes. - Did you relieve stress?

702
00:27:09,582 --> 00:27:11,051
Bo Mi, you look better.

703
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:13,019
- You look much better. - You really do.

704
00:27:13,086 --> 00:27:14,554
Was it painful?

705
00:27:14,954 --> 00:27:16,589
I can't walk properly.

706
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:17,991
(Seok Jin is the most impressed.)

707
00:27:18,191 --> 00:27:20,627
I've never kicked someone so hard.

708
00:27:20,894 --> 00:27:22,595
This can't be your first time.

709
00:27:22,595 --> 00:27:24,431
- No, it really is. - Are you sure?

710
00:27:24,497 --> 00:27:25,832
Are we going to eat again?

711
00:27:25,832 --> 00:27:28,201
I thought she said she'd kick again.

712
00:27:28,635 --> 00:27:30,336
- I misheard her. - He's traumatized.

713
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:31,805
"Shall I kick you again?"

714
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:34,441
I think she'll kick you four times minimum.

715
00:27:34,774 --> 00:27:36,576
Bo Mi is making me upset.

716
00:27:36,876 --> 00:27:38,678
- She is. - I like Bo Mi.

717
00:27:38,678 --> 00:27:39,779
(It's a new side of her.)

718
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:41,114
I like her more than before.

719
00:27:42,015 --> 00:27:43,950
(Which restaurant did Haha recommend?)

720
00:27:44,017 --> 00:27:46,186
Come on, we can win.

721
00:27:46,553 --> 00:27:49,355
(Next is a small octopus restaurant.)

722
00:27:50,857 --> 00:27:52,058
(Haha's choice in Sinsa-dong, Gangnam)

723
00:27:52,058 --> 00:27:54,427
- We've been here a lot. - It was such a long time ago.

724
00:27:54,427 --> 00:27:57,430
- It's been a long time. - The food is delicious.

725
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:00,233
- There was a long line before. - I've only tried the squid.

726
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:03,002
- Was there a long wait before? - Yes.

727
00:28:03,103 --> 00:28:05,171
This restaurant is recommended by Haha.

728
00:28:05,305 --> 00:28:07,307
It's the second restaurant for "Running Man's Food Guide".

729
00:28:07,574 --> 00:28:10,110
It's famous for small octopuses.

730
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:12,278
(It's famous for spicy small octopuses with 28 years of history.)

731
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:14,914
(It's sweet and spicy small octopus bulgogi.)

732
00:28:15,081 --> 00:28:16,149
This place...

733
00:28:16,149 --> 00:28:19,385
- has been here since the 90s. - It's legendary.

734
00:28:19,385 --> 00:28:20,520
I came here often before.

735
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,157
I used to come here and the sausage stew restaurant often.

736
00:28:24,157 --> 00:28:26,159
People came here a lot.

737
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,896
This time, you first need to enjoy all the bulgogi in front of you.

738
00:28:29,896 --> 00:28:31,831
- Really? - My goodness.

739
00:28:32,899 --> 00:28:35,401
(There's no mission?)

740
00:28:36,503 --> 00:28:40,840
(You're going to let us eat this with no strings attached?)

741
00:28:42,175 --> 00:28:46,146
(It's too good to be true.)

742
00:28:46,146 --> 00:28:49,582
- Can we get some rice? - This goes great with rice.

743
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,217
(They soon forget about being suspicious.)

744
00:28:51,784 --> 00:28:54,087
- Do you know what this is? - This tastes great.

745
00:28:54,087 --> 00:28:56,456
- The sauce tastes great. - It's been so long.

746
00:28:56,456 --> 00:28:58,625
- I haven't had this for so long. - Yes.

747
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:01,461
- I came here often with Haha. - That's right.

748
00:29:01,461 --> 00:29:03,530
We used to come here with good friends.

749
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:08,501
I didn't know Min Yong would join us today. I used to eat here with him.

750
00:29:09,102 --> 00:29:11,671
(They were poor, but they were best friends.)

751
00:29:11,671 --> 00:29:15,942
We didn't have enough money to visit anywhere else. It was still fun.

752
00:29:15,942 --> 00:29:17,210
(It's an unforgettable taste.)

753
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,679
- I ran into Jae Seok here a lot. - That's right.

754
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,581
Are you guys going to eat fried rice?

755
00:29:21,581 --> 00:29:24,851
- The sauce tastes incredible. - I agree.

756
00:29:25,451 --> 00:29:27,086
- I love this. - It tastes amazing.

757
00:29:27,086 --> 00:29:29,789
(The sauce tastes spicy at first, but it leaves behind a sweet taste.)

758
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:32,292
It tastes different from the usual stir-fried squid.

759
00:29:32,592 --> 00:29:34,661
Look. That one's a killer. It's deep-fried squid.

760
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,331
(Here's a dish that will calm down the spiciness.)

761
00:29:38,331 --> 00:29:40,533
I used to eat this a lot too.

762
00:29:42,235 --> 00:29:44,204
My gosh, this deep-fried squid tastes incredible.

763
00:29:44,204 --> 00:29:46,472
(Deep-fried squid is another signature menu of this restaurant.)

764
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,675
I really love this.

765
00:29:48,675 --> 00:29:50,843
(The savory deep-fried squid makes you crave spiciness again.)

766
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:54,781
But is it really okay for us to eat so carelessly like this?

767
00:29:54,781 --> 00:29:57,350
- Of course. - I'm not trying to be suspicious.

768
00:29:58,451 --> 00:30:00,720
(They finally finish their meal.)

769
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,889
- Did you enjoy your meal? - Yes.

770
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:04,090
It was amazing.

771
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:06,626
Then let's start the mission right away.

772
00:30:08,595 --> 00:30:10,863
(We got fooled. There was no way they'd let us eat this for nothing.)

773
00:30:11,497 --> 00:30:14,334
The name of this mission is called, "Consume Your Calories".

774
00:30:14,534 --> 00:30:16,302
- We ate a lot. - "Consume Your Calories".

775
00:30:16,603 --> 00:30:19,672
You can exit this place only after you finish...

776
00:30:19,672 --> 00:30:22,675
burning up all the calories you've absorbed.

777
00:30:22,675 --> 00:30:25,311
(Stir-fried small octopus: 366kcal, Deep-fried squid: 378kcal,)

778
00:30:25,311 --> 00:30:27,247
(Side dishes: 100kcal, Total: 844kcal)

779
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,250
- Okay. - Is that even possible?

780
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,484
(I'm doomed.)

781
00:30:31,484 --> 00:30:35,054
Three people will have to turn on their phones...

782
00:30:35,054 --> 00:30:38,057
by using a manual phone charger.

783
00:30:38,057 --> 00:30:43,496
Then you need to take a selfie with your team members and send it to me.

784
00:30:43,696 --> 00:30:44,998
- Get ready. - Okay.

785
00:30:44,998 --> 00:30:46,699
(Start consuming your calories.)

786
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:49,202
Ji Hyo, mine will turn on quickly.

787
00:30:49,202 --> 00:30:51,137
(Everyone is busy turning the handle.)

788
00:30:52,205 --> 00:30:54,173
(Powerful)

789
00:30:54,173 --> 00:30:57,010
I'm scared that this will fall off if I turn it too aggressively.

790
00:30:57,043 --> 00:30:59,579
(Their hands are almost invisible.)

791
00:30:59,579 --> 00:31:02,148
Is this charging? Can you check if this is working?

792
00:31:02,148 --> 00:31:03,616
- Mine turned on. - It's working.

793
00:31:03,616 --> 00:31:04,984
(Excited)

794
00:31:04,984 --> 00:31:07,820
- Hurry. - Calm down and keep going.

795
00:31:07,987 --> 00:31:09,355
- It's working. - It turned on.

796
00:31:09,355 --> 00:31:10,790
(Ji Hyo is in charge of calming the whiners.)

797
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,293
- Ji Hyo, this is killing me. - Keep going.

798
00:31:13,293 --> 00:31:15,461
- We only need to turn on one phone. - My gosh, this is so hard.

799
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:17,397
- My gosh. - We need to take a selfie.

800
00:31:17,397 --> 00:31:19,332
(I can feel...)

801
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:23,703
(my second ego entering my body.)

802
00:31:23,703 --> 00:31:28,207
(Phone, can you hear me?)

803
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:32,679
(Just like how Toruk Makto communicates,)

804
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:38,051
(please hurry up and brighten your screens!)

805
00:31:40,086 --> 00:31:46,459
(Will Kwang Soo be able to awaken the sleeping phones?)

806
00:31:47,894 --> 00:31:50,596
- Keep going. - It's on!

807
00:31:50,596 --> 00:31:51,698
(The phone is on.)

808
00:31:51,698 --> 00:31:53,333
- Hurry. - In 1, 2, 3.

809
00:31:53,633 --> 00:32:00,573
(They need to take a photo and send it to complete their mission.)

810
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:03,242
(Jong Kook's team succeeds with the first phone.)

811
00:32:03,242 --> 00:32:05,845
- I got one from Jong Kook's team. - I sent it.

812
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:08,348
- Let's do this. - Keep going.

813
00:32:08,348 --> 00:32:10,083
Hey, look at the camera while you're at it.

814
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:13,686
- We're almost done. - Everyone, let's take a picture.

815
00:32:14,687 --> 00:32:16,322
(They don't have enough battery.)

816
00:32:16,322 --> 00:32:19,092
- It's on. - My gosh, we need more battery.

817
00:32:19,092 --> 00:32:20,960
(They fail to take a picture.)

818
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,995
- Hurry up. - Give it a try.

819
00:32:22,995 --> 00:32:24,630
- Come on. - Do it with mine.

820
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:25,732
- No. - Try it now.

821
00:32:25,732 --> 00:32:27,433
(Ji Hyo is suffering because of the whiners.)

822
00:32:28,101 --> 00:32:30,036
(Let's try it with another phone.)

823
00:32:30,136 --> 00:32:31,337
Hurry. Come here.

824
00:32:31,337 --> 00:32:33,106
- Why is it only one percent? - What?

825
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:35,875
- Hurry up! - We can still take a photo.

826
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,410
(The other phones only have 1 percent battery life.)

827
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:39,479
(They seem exhausted.)

828
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:42,081
- Shouldn't it have more battery? - It's weird.

829
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:44,684
(Is it my turn to show my power?)

830
00:32:45,952 --> 00:32:49,689
(Endless power)

831
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:55,261
(He's like a human motor.)

832
00:32:56,496 --> 00:32:58,431
(It finally turns on.)

833
00:32:59,298 --> 00:33:02,001
(They even succeed in turning on the camera.)

834
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:04,137
- It worked! Hurry! - Haha, look here!

835
00:33:04,137 --> 00:33:06,105
In 1, 2, 3.

836
00:33:07,073 --> 00:33:10,410
(Jong Kook's team succeeds again with their second phone.)

837
00:33:11,244 --> 00:33:12,578
(The current score is 2 to 0.)

838
00:33:12,578 --> 00:33:14,480
- Hurry. - We don't have enough battery.

839
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,848
Come on. Turn it faster.

840
00:33:15,848 --> 00:33:17,984
(Did you not see what that team has already achieved?)

841
00:33:17,984 --> 00:33:21,354
- Keep going, you guys. - Ji Hyo, this is really killing me.

842
00:33:21,354 --> 00:33:22,388
Wait.

843
00:33:22,388 --> 00:33:23,990
(He's too exhausted to even sit down properly.)

844
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,625
- This is so hard. - Just a second.

845
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:26,993
(This team is a group of weaklings.)

846
00:33:27,727 --> 00:33:28,995
(It's on!)

847
00:33:28,995 --> 00:33:31,831
My phone turned on. Hurry up. Min Yong, come here.

848
00:33:31,831 --> 00:33:33,299
(For the first time, they finally turn on the camera.)

849
00:33:34,133 --> 00:33:36,936
- Jae Seok's team sent me one too. - Nice work.

850
00:33:38,237 --> 00:33:39,372
(The current score is 2 to 1.)

851
00:33:39,372 --> 00:33:40,773
- Let's go. - Hurry up.

852
00:33:40,773 --> 00:33:42,275
(Jong Kook's team only has 1 more phone to turn on.)

853
00:33:42,275 --> 00:33:45,378
- Look here. In 1, 2, 3. - Hurry up.

854
00:33:45,378 --> 00:33:46,846
(They pose for victory.)

855
00:33:46,846 --> 00:33:49,215
- We need more battery. - Let's try again.

856
00:33:49,348 --> 00:33:50,516
(This gives Jae Seok's team a golden opportunity.)

857
00:33:50,516 --> 00:33:53,252
- We need more battery. - You guys are really close.

858
00:33:53,252 --> 00:33:54,787
- Hurry up! - I can't do this.

859
00:33:54,787 --> 00:33:56,689
(Use the energy you used to eat the stir-fried small octopus.)

860
00:33:56,989 --> 00:33:59,192
- Take a photo with mine. - No, wait.

861
00:33:59,192 --> 00:34:01,427
- Try it with mine. - Hurry up.

862
00:34:01,427 --> 00:34:02,462
Okay.

863
00:34:02,462 --> 00:34:03,963
(She turns on Seok Jin's camera.)

864
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,332
(They take a photo.)

865
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:09,435
- We did it. - Hurry up and send it.

866
00:34:09,435 --> 00:34:13,072
(They successfully send their second photo.)

867
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:15,775
(The current score is 2 to 2.)

868
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:18,044
- This is driving me crazy. - This is so hard.

869
00:34:18,044 --> 00:34:19,345
(They need to hurry up to beat the other team.)

870
00:34:19,979 --> 00:34:22,782
(They're already done consuming their calories.)

871
00:34:22,782 --> 00:34:25,251
- Hurry up! - My arm hurts!

872
00:34:26,853 --> 00:34:29,355
- Hey, let's just try this. - Screen capture?

873
00:34:29,355 --> 00:34:30,389
(Whispering)

874
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:32,325
- Be quiet. - Try it.

875
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:34,427
- Let's send this. - Hurry up.

876
00:34:34,427 --> 00:34:36,629
(Can they successfully take a screen shot?)

877
00:34:36,963 --> 00:34:38,831
- In 1, 2, 3. - How are they taking a picture?

878
00:34:39,832 --> 00:34:41,334
(What are they doing?)

879
00:34:42,335 --> 00:34:45,938
(You won't know even if you see it.)

880
00:34:47,874 --> 00:34:49,575
How do you take a screen shot?

881
00:34:49,575 --> 00:34:50,576
(What is Bo Mi trying to screen shot?)

882
00:34:50,576 --> 00:34:52,778
You just need to press that button.

883
00:34:52,778 --> 00:34:55,248
(They're trying to take a screen shot of a video call screen.)

884
00:34:56,215 --> 00:34:57,517
(You can take a video call even with just one percent battery life.)

885
00:34:57,517 --> 00:34:59,252
Send it. We did it, right?

886
00:35:00,052 --> 00:35:01,053
Let's try...

887
00:35:01,053 --> 00:35:04,056
(Jong Kook's team wins.)

888
00:35:05,825 --> 00:35:08,528
- Bo Mi's so smart. - I'm so happy.

889
00:35:08,528 --> 00:35:11,931
- My goodness. - How did you think of that?

890
00:35:11,931 --> 00:35:13,933
Did they send a photo from another phone?

891
00:35:13,933 --> 00:35:16,302
- No, that's not it. - Is it a different number?

892
00:35:16,302 --> 00:35:20,239
Jong Kook's team screen captured a video call screen and sent it.

893
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,240
(Ta-da)

894
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,409
The video call worked. We captured that.

895
00:35:24,477 --> 00:35:26,512
- She's so smart. - Bo Mi.

896
00:35:26,512 --> 00:35:28,981
- How incredible. - You're so smart, Bo Mi.

897
00:35:28,981 --> 00:35:31,884
Here's something for Jong Kook's team who won.

898
00:35:31,884 --> 00:35:33,286
(Jong Kook's team gets 1 item.)

899
00:35:33,286 --> 00:35:36,088
- This is your second hint. - This is a small octopus.

900
00:35:36,088 --> 00:35:39,191
- The second hint is... - Seafood!

901
00:35:39,892 --> 00:35:40,893
It's alive.

902
00:35:41,294 --> 00:35:43,195
(Rice, barley, and seafood are three very different items.)

903
00:35:43,195 --> 00:35:45,531
- We ate small octopus. - It's alive.

904
00:35:46,198 --> 00:35:47,633
The next place is...

905
00:35:47,934 --> 00:35:50,236
recommended by Jong Kook. It's a restaurant that sells eel.

906
00:35:50,236 --> 00:35:52,471
- I love eel. - Let's go.

907
00:35:53,372 --> 00:35:54,373
("Running Man's Food Guide")

908
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,077
(Braised spicy chicken, eel, small octopus, bulgogi)

909
00:35:59,312 --> 00:36:03,883
(Jong Kook's favorite restaurant is located in Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul.)

910
00:36:04,684 --> 00:36:07,086
(It's a restaurant where you can taste fiery eel.)

911
00:36:07,086 --> 00:36:08,321
I'm looking forward to this dish.

912
00:36:08,421 --> 00:36:10,256
It's different.

913
00:36:10,423 --> 00:36:11,924
- Is it good? - Yes.

914
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:15,995
(They serve spicy grilled eel and salted grilled eel.)

915
00:36:15,995 --> 00:36:18,431
We will be going to the restaurant recommended by Jong Kook.

916
00:36:18,497 --> 00:36:20,132
The restaurant that sells grilled eel.

917
00:36:21,067 --> 00:36:23,903
The team that gets to the place through public transportation...

918
00:36:23,903 --> 00:36:26,272
- first will be the winner. - Really?

919
00:36:26,272 --> 00:36:29,775
You just need to get there first. You can use the bus or the subway.

920
00:36:30,676 --> 00:36:32,678
- First you need to... - I guess we need to choose.

921
00:36:32,678 --> 00:36:34,714
- My goodness. - Why are you guys picking first?

922
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:37,316
- But at this hour, the subway... - Let's choose.

923
00:36:37,316 --> 00:36:39,452
(They can only use the transportation they've picked.)

924
00:36:39,452 --> 00:36:42,888
- Yes, we got the subway. - The subway's way better.

925
00:36:42,888 --> 00:36:44,991
- We can let them win at least once. - Sure.

926
00:36:44,991 --> 00:36:46,959
Taking the bus doesn't mean that we'll lose either.

927
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:50,363
- You can go now. - Let's have a fair start.

928
00:36:50,363 --> 00:36:52,898
- The subway is better right now. - The subway is faster.

929
00:36:53,065 --> 00:36:54,500
- See you later. - Bye.

930
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,068
(They all head to the place recommended by Jong Kook.)

931
00:36:56,902 --> 00:36:58,938
- It's here. - We just need to transfer once.

932
00:36:58,938 --> 00:37:00,239
(They need to check the route first.)

933
00:37:00,973 --> 00:37:04,210
Taking a bus is really comfortable.

934
00:37:04,844 --> 00:37:07,246
We need to find a bus that goes to Yeouido.

935
00:37:07,246 --> 00:37:09,348
(Let's take a bus that goes to Yeouido when we're not sure.)

936
00:37:10,716 --> 00:37:13,619
- I found it. Bus number 362. - Let's take that bus.

937
00:37:14,086 --> 00:37:15,421
Where do we get off?

938
00:37:15,421 --> 00:37:18,290
We need to get off at Yeouido and head to Yeongdeungpo from there.

939
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,259
- Really? - I know you.

940
00:37:20,259 --> 00:37:22,228
- Hello. - Hello.

941
00:37:22,361 --> 00:37:25,097
- I watch your show a lot. - Thank you.

942
00:37:25,097 --> 00:37:28,234
- You even had a cute second child. - Yes, thank you.

943
00:37:28,234 --> 00:37:30,336
(He's embarrassed and grateful.)

944
00:37:30,503 --> 00:37:31,704
- Thank you. - Thank you.

945
00:37:31,704 --> 00:37:34,073
- The bus is here! - Bus number 362!

946
00:37:34,073 --> 00:37:36,242
- Get on. - It goes to Yeouido, right?

947
00:37:36,242 --> 00:37:38,978
- We need to get to Yeouido first. - Four people?

948
00:37:39,278 --> 00:37:42,982
- We have four people. - Yes.

949
00:37:42,982 --> 00:37:44,316
Thank you.

950
00:37:44,316 --> 00:37:46,585
(We'll soon be there to greet you guys.)

951
00:37:46,585 --> 00:37:48,054
Go to the back.

952
00:37:50,222 --> 00:37:52,058
(The bus departs.)

953
00:37:53,793 --> 00:37:56,195
(Let's be quiet and not cause trouble to others.)

954
00:37:56,195 --> 00:37:58,931
- How many stations should we go? - Just a few stops.

955
00:37:58,931 --> 00:38:01,434
I'm going to give you guys a mission right now.

956
00:38:01,434 --> 00:38:03,235
- In here? - Yes.

957
00:38:03,235 --> 00:38:04,904
(The mission is rock-paper-scissors.)

958
00:38:04,904 --> 00:38:07,306
(After throwing a dice, they need to win the equivalent amount of...)

959
00:38:07,306 --> 00:38:09,709
(games of rock-paper-scissors in a row.)

960
00:38:09,709 --> 00:38:12,278
(If they win, they'll be given a chance to choose a chance card.)

961
00:38:12,678 --> 00:38:14,780
- There are some chance cards. - Okay.

962
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,916
Among the cards, there's a card where you can take the taxi.

963
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:20,119
(There's a taxi card which will allow them to get there faster.)

964
00:38:20,352 --> 00:38:22,922
- And? - The others are...

965
00:38:22,922 --> 00:38:26,459
two Push-Out Cards and a dud.

966
00:38:26,459 --> 00:38:27,793
(Two Push-Out Cards and a dud)

967
00:38:27,993 --> 00:38:31,597
If you pick a Push-Out Card, the other team has to get off.

968
00:38:31,697 --> 00:38:34,100
Does that mean we might have to get off the bus too?

969
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,201
(It's important to avoid the dud.)

970
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:36,902
Let's hurry.

971
00:38:36,902 --> 00:38:38,404
(The subway team starts from Apgujeong Station.)

972
00:38:38,404 --> 00:38:39,905
- We're finally running. - Ji Hyo.

973
00:38:39,905 --> 00:38:41,907
Hurry. We don't have much time.

974
00:38:42,408 --> 00:38:43,609
We should go that way.

975
00:38:43,609 --> 00:38:46,278
- We have to go to Chungmuro. - It's this way.

976
00:38:46,645 --> 00:38:48,013
It'll open.

977
00:38:48,013 --> 00:38:49,782
(They'll transfer at Jongno 3-ga.)

978
00:38:49,782 --> 00:38:51,217
I haven't been on the subway in a long time.

979
00:38:51,217 --> 00:38:53,185
- It's coming. - It's coming.

980
00:38:53,385 --> 00:38:55,221
- Do you know where we're going? - Of course.

981
00:38:56,222 --> 00:38:57,790
- Let's get on. - Let's get on.

982
00:38:58,491 --> 00:39:00,593
- How many stops? - Please excuse us.

983
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,928
- It's five stops. - There are many senior citizens.

984
00:39:03,395 --> 00:39:05,030
- Let's keep our voices down. - Hello.

985
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,332
(The subway team heads for their third spot.)

986
00:39:06,332 --> 00:39:08,000
Are we going to do it here?

987
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,302
Let's do it here.

988
00:39:11,804 --> 00:39:12,972
- Ji Hyo. - Who should do it?

989
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:19,011
(We lost twice in a row. We have only one to rely on.)

990
00:39:19,011 --> 00:39:20,279
Min Yong, do you want to try?

991
00:39:20,513 --> 00:39:21,947
We need one.

992
00:39:21,947 --> 00:39:23,883
- Do we need 1? - Yes, avoid 6.

993
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,584
- This is my first time. - Say, "challenge".

994
00:39:25,584 --> 00:39:26,652
Challenge.

995
00:39:27,453 --> 00:39:28,754
I'll start.

996
00:39:30,089 --> 00:39:31,190
One!

997
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,291
(He throws the die nonchalantly.)

998
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:33,893
One.

999
00:39:34,093 --> 00:39:35,294
One.

1000
00:39:35,294 --> 00:39:37,229
(Is Min Yong lucky or unlucky?)

1001
00:39:37,963 --> 00:39:39,198
One.

1002
00:39:39,231 --> 00:39:40,332
It's a two.

1003
00:39:40,332 --> 00:39:42,001
(They get 2.)

1004
00:39:42,001 --> 00:39:43,602
(See?)

1005
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,006
- Good. That was amazing. - We got two.

1006
00:39:47,006 --> 00:39:48,073
You're very good.

1007
00:39:48,073 --> 00:39:49,542
I ranked number two in the forgotten celebrity survey.

1008
00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:52,778
- Who was number one? - Goo Bon Seung.

1009
00:39:52,778 --> 00:39:54,713
(Goo Bon Seung was number one.)

1010
00:39:54,713 --> 00:39:56,282
- We need to win just twice. - He did a great job.

1011
00:39:56,282 --> 00:39:58,450
If you win twice in a row, you'll get to pick a card.

1012
00:39:58,584 --> 00:40:00,586
- I'll try it as I threw the die. - You try.

1013
00:40:00,586 --> 00:40:01,654
You should.

1014
00:40:01,654 --> 00:40:03,289
Can you play rock-paper-scissors with him?

1015
00:40:03,355 --> 00:40:04,557
What are you going to show?

1016
00:40:04,557 --> 00:40:06,292
(The woman happily accepts the challenge.)

1017
00:40:06,292 --> 00:40:09,161
- Please. - I'm a man.

1018
00:40:09,161 --> 00:40:13,632
(I'm a man, and you know what that means.)

1019
00:40:13,632 --> 00:40:14,733
Rock-paper-scissors.

1020
00:40:14,733 --> 00:40:17,603
(Then I'll give you paper.)

1021
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:19,572
(Min Yong fails right away.)

1022
00:40:19,572 --> 00:40:21,473
She wants to win of course.

1023
00:40:21,473 --> 00:40:22,675
(He underestimated her.)

1024
00:40:22,675 --> 00:40:23,809
We should try once again.

1025
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:25,911
- It'll be all right. - Throw the die first.

1026
00:40:26,278 --> 00:40:28,214
- I'll throw the die. - We need a one.

1027
00:40:29,615 --> 00:40:32,084
(Will a miracle happen?)

1028
00:40:33,085 --> 00:40:34,553
- It's a 2. - It's a 2.

1029
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,021
Go over there.

1030
00:40:36,088 --> 00:40:38,791
Could you play rock-paper-scissors with me?

1031
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:40,492
(The man is puzzled.)

1032
00:40:40,492 --> 00:40:43,596
Rock-paper-scissors. Rock-paper-scissors.

1033
00:40:44,063 --> 00:40:45,564
(Seok Jin wins.)

1034
00:40:45,631 --> 00:40:46,799
He won.

1035
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:47,933
Thank you.

1036
00:40:47,933 --> 00:40:49,068
(Seok Jin is sneaky.)

1037
00:40:49,201 --> 00:40:50,336
Can we play rock-paper-scissors?

1038
00:40:50,502 --> 00:40:53,072
(He needs to win just one more time.)

1039
00:40:53,072 --> 00:40:54,173
Rock-paper-scissors.

1040
00:40:55,307 --> 00:40:57,843
(Will they get to take a taxi to Yeongdeungpo?)

1041
00:40:57,943 --> 00:41:00,880
(Will they get to push the other team out of the bus?)

1042
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,749
(Will Seok Jin unexpectedly bring victory to his team?)

1043
00:41:05,517 --> 00:41:06,685
(Seok Jin wins.)

1044
00:41:06,685 --> 00:41:09,688
Nice! You did it!

1045
00:41:09,788 --> 00:41:10,823
(Be quiet.)

1046
00:41:10,823 --> 00:41:13,559
(They're celebrating silently.)

1047
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:15,194
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1048
00:41:15,494 --> 00:41:18,931
(The angels gave Seok Jin hope.)

1049
00:41:18,931 --> 00:41:20,432
- I can't believe this. - It's unbelievable.

1050
00:41:20,633 --> 00:41:22,401
That was amazing.

1051
00:41:23,135 --> 00:41:24,303
- That really was. - Everyone.

1052
00:41:24,403 --> 00:41:28,340
As you completed the mission, you get to pick a card.

1053
00:41:28,941 --> 00:41:30,209
Min Yong, go ahead.

1054
00:41:30,476 --> 00:41:31,543
(Min Yong does not hesitate.)

1055
00:41:31,543 --> 00:41:34,046
Min Yong, do a good job. We want a taxi.

1056
00:41:34,179 --> 00:41:37,549
(This is his chance to make up for his failure.)

1057
00:41:38,584 --> 00:41:39,718
We want a taxi.

1058
00:41:39,718 --> 00:41:41,053
(He picks a card without hesitation.)

1059
00:41:41,086 --> 00:41:42,221
It's okay as long as it's not a dud.

1060
00:41:44,356 --> 00:41:47,092
(There's a 25-percent chance it'll be the taxi.)

1061
00:41:47,226 --> 00:41:50,596
(Will Min Yong prove himself?)

1062
00:41:51,063 --> 00:41:52,231
(Sighing)

1063
00:41:52,231 --> 00:41:54,233
(Dud)

1064
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,135
You're unbelievable.

1065
00:41:56,435 --> 00:41:57,703
You're so unlucky.

1066
00:41:57,703 --> 00:41:59,505
(He's as unlucky as Kwang Soo.)

1067
00:41:59,505 --> 00:42:00,606
My goodness.

1068
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,542
(Min Yong reminds them of Kwang Soo.)

1069
00:42:03,542 --> 00:42:06,011
My goodness. I can't believe this.

1070
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,350
(In our team, you can play the role of Kwang Soo.)

1071
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:16,422
(He followed Jae Seok's order too precisely.)

1072
00:42:16,422 --> 00:42:17,589
(Is someone talking about me?)

1073
00:42:17,589 --> 00:42:22,027
You have to win as many times in a row as the number you get.

1074
00:42:22,027 --> 00:42:23,162
Okay.

1075
00:42:23,362 --> 00:42:24,797
One, two, three.

1076
00:42:24,797 --> 00:42:27,232
(Bo Mi throws the die on behalf of the other members.)

1077
00:42:28,434 --> 00:42:30,135
(It's a 2.)

1078
00:42:30,602 --> 00:42:33,339
(Good job, Bo Mi.)

1079
00:42:33,339 --> 00:42:35,074
Could you play rock-paper-scissors with me?

1080
00:42:35,074 --> 00:42:36,542
Rock-paper-scissors.

1081
00:42:36,542 --> 00:42:39,545
(Will Kwang Soo be unlucky today too?)

1082
00:42:39,545 --> 00:42:40,679
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1083
00:42:41,413 --> 00:42:44,016
(Unexpectedly, Kwang Soo wins.)

1084
00:42:44,016 --> 00:42:45,117
Did you win?

1085
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,385
Miss.

1086
00:42:47,386 --> 00:42:49,021
- Thank you. - Excuse me.

1087
00:42:49,088 --> 00:42:50,622
We need to win one more time.

1088
00:42:50,622 --> 00:42:52,491
(They spot two beautiful girls.)

1089
00:42:52,491 --> 00:42:54,093
Beautiful ladies.

1090
00:42:55,294 --> 00:42:56,595
Beautiful ladies.

1091
00:42:56,595 --> 00:42:57,696
- Hello. - Kwang Soo usually...

1092
00:42:57,696 --> 00:42:59,498
wins against beautiful girls.

1093
00:42:59,932 --> 00:43:01,133
- Kwang Soo. - Hello.

1094
00:43:01,433 --> 00:43:03,736
Could you play rock-paper-scissors with me?

1095
00:43:04,503 --> 00:43:07,573
Hello. Could you play rock-paper scissors with me?

1096
00:43:07,906 --> 00:43:08,974
Thank you.

1097
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:10,442
Here we go.

1098
00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:12,044
Rock-paper-scissors.

1099
00:43:12,911 --> 00:43:15,581
(Kwang Soo usually wins against beautiful girls.)

1100
00:43:15,581 --> 00:43:18,150
(Will he win this time too?)

1101
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,351
Rock-paper-scissors.

1102
00:43:20,052 --> 00:43:22,187
(Kwang Soo wins.)

1103
00:43:22,187 --> 00:43:23,922
(The bus team completes the mission.)

1104
00:43:23,922 --> 00:43:25,057
He won.

1105
00:43:25,891 --> 00:43:27,893
Thank you.

1106
00:43:28,994 --> 00:43:30,496
Thank you.

1107
00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:31,864
Kwang Soo is strong against beautiful girls.

1108
00:43:33,432 --> 00:43:35,834
(They celebrate silently.)

1109
00:43:36,835 --> 00:43:38,637
(They have to pick 1 card out of the 4.)

1110
00:43:38,637 --> 00:43:40,906
Each of you take one, and I'll take the one left.

1111
00:43:40,906 --> 00:43:42,875
That sounds good. Kwang Soo, you're unlucky. You go first.

1112
00:43:43,075 --> 00:43:44,209
Take one away.

1113
00:43:44,476 --> 00:43:45,577
I'll take one too.

1114
00:43:46,512 --> 00:43:49,548
(There's only one left.)

1115
00:43:49,548 --> 00:43:51,316
This one is your choice.

1116
00:43:51,316 --> 00:43:52,317
(This card is their choice.)

1117
00:43:52,351 --> 00:43:53,652
Open your cards one by one.

1118
00:43:53,652 --> 00:43:55,320
(Kwang Soo opens his card.)

1119
00:43:55,554 --> 00:43:57,322
(Kwang Soo chose the Taxi Card.)

1120
00:43:57,322 --> 00:43:59,058
Gosh, he's so unlucky.

1121
00:43:59,491 --> 00:44:01,093
I think you have a dud.

1122
00:44:01,093 --> 00:44:02,861
I think it's a dud.

1123
00:44:03,262 --> 00:44:05,998
(If one of them has a dud, it means Bo Mi has the Push-Out Card.)

1124
00:44:06,532 --> 00:44:08,500
(It's a dud.)

1125
00:44:09,935 --> 00:44:12,337
(Excited)

1126
00:44:12,538 --> 00:44:14,573
(It means...)

1127
00:44:14,573 --> 00:44:18,577
(Bo Mi picked the Push-Out Card.)

1128
00:44:21,213 --> 00:44:23,082
The Taxi Card would've been great.

1129
00:44:23,082 --> 00:44:24,650
(The other team will be forced off the subway.)

1130
00:44:25,451 --> 00:44:28,687
The other team just completed the mission.

1131
00:44:28,921 --> 00:44:30,756
You will be forced out of the subway.

1132
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:35,094
- What happens now? - You'll get off at the next stop.

1133
00:44:35,094 --> 00:44:38,197
Wait for the next train there.

1134
00:44:38,197 --> 00:44:39,231
(They'll have to wait for the next train at Euljiro 3-ga.)

1135
00:44:40,132 --> 00:44:42,601
Min Yong, you're so unlucky.

1136
00:44:43,702 --> 00:44:45,137
You're so unlucky.

1137
00:44:45,771 --> 00:44:48,407
I wish we could go just one more stop.

1138
00:44:49,174 --> 00:44:50,709
(It's one stop before the transfer station.)

1139
00:44:50,709 --> 00:44:52,478
Thank you.

1140
00:44:52,478 --> 00:44:53,846
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1141
00:44:54,113 --> 00:44:57,316
Is it one stop before the transfer station?

1142
00:44:57,316 --> 00:44:59,084
Nothing is going our way.

1143
00:44:59,084 --> 00:45:00,752
(What is wrong with us?)

1144
00:45:00,752 --> 00:45:04,723
Usually, Ji Hyo's team is good at these kinds of games,

1145
00:45:04,723 --> 00:45:05,958
but we're so unlucky.

1146
00:45:06,725 --> 00:45:09,294
The next train won't be here soon.

1147
00:45:09,595 --> 00:45:12,731
The train is approaching Chungmuro Station.

1148
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,333
We're so...

1149
00:45:14,399 --> 00:45:16,435
We've been waiting for about 10 minutes now.

1150
00:45:16,435 --> 00:45:17,903
I mean...

1151
00:45:19,004 --> 00:45:20,806
How is this humanely possible?

1152
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,609
So many things went wrong.

1153
00:45:23,609 --> 00:45:25,511
We're so unlucky today.

1154
00:45:25,511 --> 00:45:27,346
- We're not a good team. - We aren't.

1155
00:45:27,446 --> 00:45:30,048
I wish I could team up with Ji Hyo and Bo Mi.

1156
00:45:30,883 --> 00:45:35,053
It's your fault that we were forced off the train.

1157
00:45:35,087 --> 00:45:36,922
I wish I could team up with Ji Hyo and Bo Mi too.

1158
00:45:36,922 --> 00:45:38,056
Same here.

1159
00:45:39,057 --> 00:45:40,192
We all feel the same.

1160
00:45:40,192 --> 00:45:43,562
(What is Bo Mi, the girl everyone wants, doing?)

1161
00:45:43,562 --> 00:45:44,696
We're so lucky.

1162
00:45:44,696 --> 00:45:46,031
(They're relaxed.)

1163
00:45:46,031 --> 00:45:47,099
Be quiet.

1164
00:45:48,834 --> 00:45:49,835
(Blowing)

1165
00:45:49,835 --> 00:45:52,938
Your hair is flying in the wind. You're looking great.

1166
00:45:54,306 --> 00:45:55,841
That looks cool.

1167
00:45:55,841 --> 00:45:58,310
(The wind blows in my heart too.)

1168
00:45:58,310 --> 00:45:59,778
(Uncomfortable)

1169
00:46:00,746 --> 00:46:01,847
Bo Mi, what do you think of guys like him?

1170
00:46:01,847 --> 00:46:03,715
- He's handsome. - Do you think so?

1171
00:46:03,715 --> 00:46:05,684
(Thank you, cute lady.)

1172
00:46:05,684 --> 00:46:07,386
I hope those two end up together.

1173
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,488
Then we could hang out all together.

1174
00:46:10,522 --> 00:46:16,929
Let's play a game, Team White versus Team Black.

1175
00:46:16,929 --> 00:46:19,731
(Bo Mi, give me five.)

1176
00:46:20,933 --> 00:46:22,935
It's a game where you hold each other's hand.

1177
00:46:22,935 --> 00:46:24,603
Right. It's a couple game.

1178
00:46:25,771 --> 00:46:27,873
(Will you give it a try?)

1179
00:46:27,873 --> 00:46:29,074
It's a couple game.

1180
00:46:29,074 --> 00:46:30,442
(We should follow the rules.)

1181
00:46:31,276 --> 00:46:33,712
(Bo Mi...)

1182
00:46:33,712 --> 00:46:34,846
Hold each other's hand.

1183
00:46:34,846 --> 00:46:36,315
(We need to follow the rules.)

1184
00:46:37,316 --> 00:46:39,985
(Kwang Soo is happy.)

1185
00:46:39,985 --> 00:46:41,687
(It's so funny.)

1186
00:46:42,087 --> 00:46:43,422
(Kwang Soo gazes at his hand.)

1187
00:46:44,723 --> 00:46:50,195
(I think spring is here.)

1188
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:53,799
(What is with him?)

1189
00:46:54,132 --> 00:46:56,435
(I won't wash my hands.)

1190
00:46:56,501 --> 00:46:59,972
This time, our faces should touch.

1191
00:46:59,972 --> 00:47:01,206
(Their faces should touch.)

1192
00:47:02,107 --> 00:47:03,508
We shouldn't lose.

1193
00:47:05,877 --> 00:47:07,913
(These guys are hilarious.)

1194
00:47:08,614 --> 00:47:09,781
(Come on.)

1195
00:47:10,382 --> 00:47:11,617
(Ready)

1196
00:47:12,884 --> 00:47:19,958
(Bo Mi, this is just a game. We need to do our best.)

1197
00:47:19,958 --> 00:47:21,827
(Slapping)

1198
00:47:21,827 --> 00:47:24,062
(Wake up.)

1199
00:47:24,596 --> 00:47:25,931
(What did I do wrong?)

1200
00:47:25,931 --> 00:47:27,032
What?

1201
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,035
What did I do wrong?

1202
00:47:30,135 --> 00:47:32,671
You guys look so cute together.

1203
00:47:32,671 --> 00:47:34,773
(Kwang Soo and Bo Mi look cute together.)

1204
00:47:34,773 --> 00:47:36,241
(Kwang Soo feels shy.)

1205
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:37,676
(National Assembly Station)

1206
00:47:37,676 --> 00:47:41,079
(They need to transfer here.)

1207
00:47:44,283 --> 00:47:45,350
Let's do this.

1208
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:46,718
Bye. Thank you.

1209
00:47:46,718 --> 00:47:47,786
(They thank the passengers.)

1210
00:47:47,786 --> 00:47:50,489
(They need to transfer to a bus for Yeongdeungpo.)

1211
00:47:50,489 --> 00:47:52,324
- It's here! - That's our bus!

1212
00:47:52,324 --> 00:47:53,725
- Really? - Let's get on!

1213
00:47:53,725 --> 00:47:55,260
- Is this our bus? - We're so lucky.

1214
00:47:55,694 --> 00:47:56,728
My goodness.

1215
00:47:56,728 --> 00:47:58,430
(They're so lucky.)

1216
00:47:59,564 --> 00:48:01,867
- Hello. - Hello.

1217
00:48:01,867 --> 00:48:04,236
(How can they be this lucky?)

1218
00:48:05,137 --> 00:48:07,973
(The bus team already transferred.)

1219
00:48:08,373 --> 00:48:09,308
(The subway team is about to transfer.)

1220
00:48:09,308 --> 00:48:11,443
- Are we taking Line Five? - Yes.

1221
00:48:13,779 --> 00:48:15,514
I haven't transferred at Jongno 3-ga Station in forever.

1222
00:48:16,782 --> 00:48:18,717
The platform is very far.

1223
00:48:20,252 --> 00:48:21,620
Jae Seok, we have to hurry.

1224
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,888
Right. I know.

1225
00:48:23,055 --> 00:48:24,089
Is this it?

1226
00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:25,290
(They can't give up now.)

1227
00:48:25,457 --> 00:48:27,059
We have to go to Yeongdeungpo Market Station.

1228
00:48:27,092 --> 00:48:28,293
- We have to get on this. - Yeongdeungpo Market Station?

1229
00:48:28,327 --> 00:48:29,928
We have to start now.

1230
00:48:30,295 --> 00:48:31,430
Let's go.

1231
00:48:31,897 --> 00:48:34,700
(In order to rescue his team as the team captain,)

1232
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,803
(he takes the initiative and leads as an example.)

1233
00:48:37,803 --> 00:48:40,138
(Will this throw save his team from this critical situation?)

1234
00:48:40,138 --> 00:48:41,606
I can't believe this.

1235
00:48:41,606 --> 00:48:43,608
(He throws the highest number as the team captain.)

1236
00:48:43,608 --> 00:48:45,077
You are truly unlucky.

1237
00:48:45,077 --> 00:48:47,679
- You have to get smacked by us. - Hold on.

1238
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:49,848
(His unluckiness is beyond their expectations.)

1239
00:48:49,848 --> 00:48:52,517
- How can you get six? - Let me try.

1240
00:48:52,517 --> 00:48:55,220
Who knows? If you succeed, it's a miracle.

1241
00:48:55,354 --> 00:48:57,222
- It's not easy though. - He's really unlucky.

1242
00:48:57,222 --> 00:48:59,591
Excuse me, I have to play rock-paper-scissors with six people.

1243
00:48:59,858 --> 00:49:01,159
How could he get six?

1244
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:02,227
(He's one of a kind.)

1245
00:49:02,828 --> 00:49:05,063
Can you play rock-paper-scissors with me? Rock-paper-scissors.

1246
00:49:05,263 --> 00:49:07,366
(Jae Seok, cheer up with this 1st win.)

1247
00:49:07,632 --> 00:49:08,834
She let him win.

1248
00:49:09,267 --> 00:49:11,303
(He happily wins 2 times in a row.)

1249
00:49:11,303 --> 00:49:12,904
(He has to win 4 more times.)

1250
00:49:12,904 --> 00:49:15,474
(Somehow, he manages to win 3 times in a row.)

1251
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:19,010
(They allow themselves to get their hopes up.)

1252
00:49:19,778 --> 00:49:21,980
Can you play rock-paper-scissors with me? Rock-paper-scissors.

1253
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:24,716
(He miraculously wins 4 times in a row!)

1254
00:49:25,417 --> 00:49:26,551
Jae Seok.

1255
00:49:26,551 --> 00:49:29,087
- You have two more left. - Just think you just started.

1256
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,889
- Just think that. - Can you play rock-paper-scissors?

1257
00:49:30,889 --> 00:49:32,457
(She seems to be ready to play.)

1258
00:49:32,724 --> 00:49:34,426
(The fifth citizen doesn't seem ordinary.)

1259
00:49:34,426 --> 00:49:36,728
(Will he be able to continue his miracle?)

1260
00:49:36,728 --> 00:49:37,963
Rock-paper-scissors.

1261
00:49:40,332 --> 00:49:42,667
(What a surprise! At this point, it's getting a bit scary.)

1262
00:49:42,667 --> 00:49:44,703
- Jae Seok. - You have to win just one more.

1263
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,471
- Just this once. - I only have one person left.

1264
00:49:47,439 --> 00:49:48,473
(He led an unlucky life.)

1265
00:49:48,473 --> 00:49:49,474
Please.

1266
00:49:49,474 --> 00:49:52,444
(A miracle on Line 5 is granted to Jae Seok.)

1267
00:49:52,444 --> 00:49:55,947
(No one had hopes for this sixth match.)

1268
00:49:55,947 --> 00:49:59,851
(What will Jae Seok's fate be?)

1269
00:49:59,851 --> 00:50:01,086
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1270
00:50:01,086 --> 00:50:02,154
(He wins 6 times in a row!)

1271
00:50:02,154 --> 00:50:03,321
He did it!

1272
00:50:03,688 --> 00:50:05,657
(The universe is on his side.)

1273
00:50:06,992 --> 00:50:08,760
- I'm sorry. Are you all right? - I'm okay.

1274
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,262
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1275
00:50:10,262 --> 00:50:11,329
He beat six people.

1276
00:50:11,329 --> 00:50:13,231
- I'm sorry. Are you okay? - How did he do this?

1277
00:50:13,365 --> 00:50:15,033
- This is amazing. - It's unbelievable.

1278
00:50:15,133 --> 00:50:16,701
- This is all thanks to you all. - This is awesome.

1279
00:50:17,169 --> 00:50:18,670
- Thank you all. - You did it, Jae Seok!

1280
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:20,972
- You are the best. - How did you manage that?

1281
00:50:21,139 --> 00:50:22,674
- You did it. - You are so cool.

1282
00:50:23,074 --> 00:50:24,476
You are really cool.

1283
00:50:25,076 --> 00:50:26,144
Is it time now?

1284
00:50:26,144 --> 00:50:27,813
- We have to get 1 Push-Out Card. - There are 2 Push-Out Cards.

1285
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:31,183
If you draw the Taxi Card, you are unlucky again.

1286
00:50:31,183 --> 00:50:32,717
If you choose the Taxi Card, you're ruined.

1287
00:50:32,717 --> 00:50:35,187
If that's the case, we are doomed.

1288
00:50:35,554 --> 00:50:38,490
(A Push-Out Card is their only hope to have a chance at winning.)

1289
00:50:39,658 --> 00:50:41,860
- Jae Seok. - I can't look.

1290
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,295
- I'll look. - Please.

1291
00:50:43,395 --> 00:50:46,498
(So far, they failed all the missions.)

1292
00:50:46,498 --> 00:50:49,434
(They must win this mission by all means.)

1293
00:50:49,434 --> 00:50:50,802
It's a Push-Out Card!

1294
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:54,906
(They are over the moon.)

1295
00:50:54,906 --> 00:50:55,974
Be quiet.

1296
00:50:56,608 --> 00:50:58,477
- This is amazing. - I picked the right one.

1297
00:50:58,477 --> 00:50:59,511
(Get off now.)

1298
00:51:01,613 --> 00:51:03,315
What is your ideal type?

1299
00:51:03,348 --> 00:51:04,783
- Are you asking Kwang Soo? - It's you.

1300
00:51:04,883 --> 00:51:06,051
It's you.

1301
00:51:06,251 --> 00:51:07,319
My ideal type is...

1302
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:11,790
(The type of girl I like is...)

1303
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:13,592
Please get off now.

1304
00:51:14,092 --> 00:51:15,794
- Wait. - They were talking.

1305
00:51:16,161 --> 00:51:18,396
We were talking about my ideal type.

1306
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:19,798
Do we have to get off?

1307
00:51:19,798 --> 00:51:21,500
The other team utilized the Push-Out Card.

1308
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,201
(They were about to arrive at the restaurant.)

1309
00:51:23,201 --> 00:51:24,970
- They got the Push-Out Card? - Really?

1310
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:26,238
(Do we really have to get off?)

1311
00:51:26,238 --> 00:51:27,305
You must get off now.

1312
00:51:27,739 --> 00:51:29,140
- Let's get off. - All right. Let's get off first.

1313
00:51:30,342 --> 00:51:32,177
- Excuse us. - I'm sorry.

1314
00:51:33,879 --> 00:51:35,847
Another bus will come soon, right?

1315
00:51:35,847 --> 00:51:37,849
- We can get on the same one, right? - Right.

1316
00:51:37,849 --> 00:51:40,452
(Both teams are heading to a restaurant chosen by Jong Kook.)

1317
00:51:40,785 --> 00:51:44,990
The other team was only two stops away and was forced to get off.

1318
00:51:45,056 --> 00:51:47,192
- They were two stops away? - They are waiting for the bus?

1319
00:51:47,692 --> 00:51:49,227
- They are that close? - They are waiting for the bus?

1320
00:51:49,427 --> 00:51:52,631
They are only two stops away? It's really close.

1321
00:51:52,831 --> 00:51:54,499
There might be a traffic jam in Yeongdeungpo.

1322
00:51:54,499 --> 00:51:56,735
That's possible. There are a lot of cars in that area.

1323
00:51:56,735 --> 00:51:58,570
We should win at least once.

1324
00:51:58,570 --> 00:51:59,905
- That's my point too. - We must win at least once.

1325
00:52:00,272 --> 00:52:03,008
- It's frustrating. - They took all the hints.

1326
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:04,743
(Team Jae Seok strikes a blow at Team Jong Kook.)

1327
00:52:04,743 --> 00:52:06,244
- This isn't the bus? - It won't go to Yeongdeungpo.

1328
00:52:06,244 --> 00:52:07,412
How about this?

1329
00:52:07,412 --> 00:52:09,381
- It's Bus 650! - I think it goes to Yeongdeungpo.

1330
00:52:09,514 --> 00:52:10,715
Get on.

1331
00:52:11,049 --> 00:52:12,517
It goes to Yeongdeungpo. Thank you.

1332
00:52:12,517 --> 00:52:13,652
The driver told me so.

1333
00:52:13,785 --> 00:52:15,620
(Could they have gotten close?)

1334
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:18,623
This stop is Yeongdeungpo Market Station.

1335
00:52:19,357 --> 00:52:20,492
Hey, we have to run.

1336
00:52:20,492 --> 00:52:21,560
(They arrive at Yeongdeungpo Market Station.)

1337
00:52:22,761 --> 00:52:25,096
- Thank you for your help. - Is this the eel restaurant?

1338
00:52:25,096 --> 00:52:27,132
- Thank you. Have a good day. - From exit 3,

1339
00:52:27,933 --> 00:52:29,200
- how far... - We're running.

1340
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,302
Can we just go straight?

1341
00:52:30,302 --> 00:52:31,369
It's exit 3.

1342
00:52:31,369 --> 00:52:32,404
(Just run.)

1343
00:52:33,171 --> 00:52:35,407
(They also arrive at their destination.)

1344
00:52:35,574 --> 00:52:36,908
We have to hurry.

1345
00:52:37,976 --> 00:52:39,277
Jae Seok, we have to rush.

1346
00:52:39,744 --> 00:52:41,179
Seok Jin, which way do we go?

1347
00:52:41,179 --> 00:52:42,280
We have to find the parking lot.

1348
00:52:42,747 --> 00:52:44,849
- Did the other team arrive yet? - Should we hurry?

1349
00:52:46,418 --> 00:52:50,088
(On the 3rd course, a secret item and roasted eel are at stake.)

1350
00:52:50,088 --> 00:52:51,523
(It's not over until it's over.)

1351
00:52:51,523 --> 00:52:53,224
- Let us go in now. - Hold on.

1352
00:52:53,224 --> 00:52:54,392
It must be somewhere around here.

1353
00:52:54,392 --> 00:52:56,361
(Which team will arrive first?)

1354
00:52:56,528 --> 00:52:59,931
The secrets of Running Man's Food Guide are...

1355
00:52:59,931 --> 00:53:01,199
(Chocolate, rice, barley, avocado)

1356
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,701
It can't be.

1357
00:53:02,734 --> 00:53:04,569
(7 items stir up an incredible twist.)

1358
00:53:04,569 --> 00:53:05,570
(No one can predict the end.)

1359
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:06,605
We don't have time.

1360
00:53:06,605 --> 00:53:07,973
(Who will win?)

1361
00:53:15,447 --> 00:53:18,950
(The third restaurant of Running Man's Food Guide)

1362
00:53:19,551 --> 00:53:20,919
(It's chewy.)

1363
00:53:20,919 --> 00:53:22,954
(It's also cost-appropriate.)

1364
00:53:23,388 --> 00:53:25,156
- Let us go in now. - Hold on.

1365
00:53:25,156 --> 00:53:26,157
It must be somewhere around here.

1366
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:28,627
There it is!

1367
00:53:28,827 --> 00:53:30,362
- I found it. - There it is. Hello.

1368
00:53:30,362 --> 00:53:31,363
I got it.

1369
00:53:31,596 --> 00:53:32,964
There it is. It's over there!

1370
00:53:32,964 --> 00:53:34,032
(They must arrive before the other team does.)

1371
00:53:34,766 --> 00:53:39,904
(They arrive at their destination without taking a breather.)

1372
00:53:40,105 --> 00:53:44,242
(Team Jae Seok finally enters the eel restaurant.)

1373
00:53:44,709 --> 00:53:46,244
- You're here. - Hey, you are here.

1374
00:53:46,244 --> 00:53:48,146
(They are at ease.)

1375
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,615
(Those jerks...)

1376
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,585
- Thank you. - My goodness.

1377
00:53:53,585 --> 00:53:54,653
Leave it.

1378
00:53:54,653 --> 00:53:57,555
(It's a famous eel restaurant in Yeongdeungpo for its soft texture.)

1379
00:53:57,555 --> 00:53:59,257
(This roasted eel goes...)

1380
00:53:59,257 --> 00:54:00,825
- It's tasty. - I can't believe it.

1381
00:54:00,825 --> 00:54:01,926
(This roasted eel goes...)

1382
00:54:01,926 --> 00:54:04,229
(to these people.)

1383
00:54:04,229 --> 00:54:05,363
This is it.

1384
00:54:05,697 --> 00:54:08,199
(What a letdown. Give us some water.)

1385
00:54:08,199 --> 00:54:10,001
- Please give us some water. - This is delicious.

1386
00:54:10,001 --> 00:54:11,836
They only drank water today.

1387
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:13,938
- This is your hint for this round. - All right.

1388
00:54:14,305 --> 00:54:17,609
(The winning team is also provided with peanuts.)

1389
00:54:17,842 --> 00:54:19,511
- We got peanuts. - Peanuts.

1390
00:54:19,511 --> 00:54:21,312
We have peanuts here too.

1391
00:54:21,312 --> 00:54:22,914
Thank you for the food.

1392
00:54:23,615 --> 00:54:26,518
Why can't we win at least once? This is frustrating.

1393
00:54:26,518 --> 00:54:28,653
- I'm full. Thank you for the meal. - Thank you for the food.

1394
00:54:28,653 --> 00:54:30,121
(They head to the fourth restaurant.)

1395
00:54:30,388 --> 00:54:31,456
(Running Man's Food Guide)

1396
00:54:31,456 --> 00:54:35,193
(Braised spicy chicken, eel, octopus, and bulgogi restaurants.)

1397
00:54:36,094 --> 00:54:38,630
(Current status on items obtained by each team)

1398
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,699
- Hello. - I've been here a lot.

1399
00:54:40,699 --> 00:54:42,167
I had so many take-outs.

1400
00:54:42,167 --> 00:54:44,502
- There are outdoor tables. - I didn't know about this place.

1401
00:54:44,502 --> 00:54:45,837
Bo Mi, this is a famous restaurant.

1402
00:54:45,837 --> 00:54:47,605
- I've never been here. - A lot of people buy this dish.

1403
00:54:47,706 --> 00:54:49,340
Seok Jin chose this place, right?

1404
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:51,509
I also come here often.

1405
00:54:51,509 --> 00:54:52,744
- You do? - Yes.

1406
00:54:52,911 --> 00:54:54,412
- I'm glad. - This place is really popular.

1407
00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:56,514
This place is known for having big chicken drumsticks.

1408
00:54:56,514 --> 00:54:59,451
Whenever I come to this area for a shoot,

1409
00:54:59,451 --> 00:55:01,453
- I always get takeout. - You do?

1410
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:03,788
- Of course. - This is delicious.

1411
00:55:05,356 --> 00:55:06,858
- What's wrong, Jae Seok? - If we lost again...

1412
00:55:07,292 --> 00:55:08,727
- What's up? - He's mad.

1413
00:55:08,727 --> 00:55:09,994
- I'm so mad. - You are not in a good mood.

1414
00:55:09,994 --> 00:55:12,063
I ran so much that I lost my appetite.

1415
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:13,698
Can I go to the hair salon?

1416
00:55:14,065 --> 00:55:16,801
- Why? - I think my hair got messy.

1417
00:55:16,968 --> 00:55:19,437
- He's really neat. - Were you in a bad mood like this?

1418
00:55:19,437 --> 00:55:20,939
Were you bickering at each other?

1419
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:24,109
It's not that your team is good. We analyzed about your team.

1420
00:55:24,542 --> 00:55:26,878
Kwang Soo. Haha. What is your job in your team?

1421
00:55:26,878 --> 00:55:29,047
(He takes a shot at these two incompetent members.)

1422
00:55:29,047 --> 00:55:30,715
Me? Were you referring to me?

1423
00:55:30,715 --> 00:55:31,750
- Bo Mi... - Hold on.

1424
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:33,752
- To be honest, Bo Mi... - Bo Mi...

1425
00:55:33,752 --> 00:55:35,019
and Jong Kook. Hold on.

1426
00:55:35,019 --> 00:55:37,522
Jong Kook and Bo Mi are facing the same problem.

1427
00:55:37,522 --> 00:55:39,691
- I can't believe this. - Bo Mi. You should tell him.

1428
00:55:39,691 --> 00:55:42,193
They radiate positive energy.

1429
00:55:42,193 --> 00:55:44,929
- They help us a lot. - You don't have to be nice here.

1430
00:55:45,063 --> 00:55:47,332
The last course of Running Man's Food Guide...

1431
00:55:47,332 --> 00:55:49,501
recommended by the members is...

1432
00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:53,238
a famous braised spicy chicken restaurant. It was Seok Jin's pick.

1433
00:55:53,238 --> 00:55:57,008
You will find out what the game is once you finish...

1434
00:55:57,509 --> 00:55:58,710
braised spicy chicken placed in front of you.

1435
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:00,879
- Really? - You can enjoy the food first.

1436
00:56:01,446 --> 00:56:02,914
- The spice stings your tongue. - It does.

1437
00:56:02,981 --> 00:56:04,883
- It feels like that. - We will eat this with rice.

1438
00:56:05,416 --> 00:56:08,520
(Braised spicy chicken tastes best when it's eaten with rice.)

1439
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,954
(It suits Min Yong's taste perfectly.)

1440
00:56:09,954 --> 00:56:11,456
- Isn't this delicious? - It's good.

1441
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:13,424
Bo Mi. Try this.

1442
00:56:13,424 --> 00:56:15,627
- This is the delicious part. - Thank you.

1443
00:56:17,862 --> 00:56:19,097
Let's stir-fry the rice.

1444
00:56:19,464 --> 00:56:20,632
(She turns into an eater.)

1445
00:56:20,632 --> 00:56:21,866
This is tasty.

1446
00:56:21,866 --> 00:56:23,468
I'm glad we're finishing up with spicy food.

1447
00:56:23,735 --> 00:56:25,103
I think I ate the non-spicy one before.

1448
00:56:25,103 --> 00:56:26,471
You probably did.

1449
00:56:26,938 --> 00:56:28,740
Bo Mi can eat.

1450
00:56:29,107 --> 00:56:30,141
(She's on another level.)

1451
00:56:30,141 --> 00:56:31,810
She slowly eats everything.

1452
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:33,778
We ate all the ingredients from land, sea, and air.

1453
00:56:33,912 --> 00:56:36,948
The highlight of braised spicy chicken is...

1454
00:56:36,948 --> 00:56:38,416
- fried rice. - It's fried rice!

1455
00:56:38,416 --> 00:56:39,417
Of course.

1456
00:56:39,417 --> 00:56:41,452
- It's very delicious. - It's great.

1457
00:56:41,452 --> 00:56:43,621
We will bring in fried rice.

1458
00:56:43,621 --> 00:56:45,824
This place is also famous for cooked glutinous rice.

1459
00:56:46,691 --> 00:56:47,892
- Gosh. - That's it.

1460
00:56:47,892 --> 00:56:50,328
(Is there a chopstick in the middle of the fried rice?)

1461
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:54,866
- We'll play the game with this. - You guys.

1462
00:56:54,866 --> 00:56:57,001
- I am good at this. - Are you?

1463
00:56:57,101 --> 00:56:59,337
- I used to do this with soil a lot. - That's right.

1464
00:56:59,337 --> 00:57:01,206
- Our team will win this game. - Are you serious?

1465
00:57:01,206 --> 00:57:02,807
Ji Hyo, don't you worry. I mean it.

1466
00:57:02,807 --> 00:57:03,942
All right then.

1467
00:57:03,942 --> 00:57:05,210
The rule is simple.

1468
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:07,912
Players from each team will take turns...

1469
00:57:07,912 --> 00:57:10,582
to scoop out a spoonful of fried rice.

1470
00:57:10,582 --> 00:57:13,218
Whichever team tips over the chopstick will lose.

1471
00:57:13,785 --> 00:57:14,953
We have to eat what we scoop out, right?

1472
00:57:14,953 --> 00:57:17,121
- You must eat what you scoop out. - Of course. That's obvious.

1473
00:57:17,422 --> 00:57:19,691
- Let's begin. - Can I go first?

1474
00:57:19,724 --> 00:57:20,992
You have to eat what you spoon out.

1475
00:57:21,726 --> 00:57:22,794
(It's a generous amount.)

1476
00:57:23,094 --> 00:57:25,763
- You have a voracious appetite. - She does.

1477
00:57:25,763 --> 00:57:27,866
- She can eat. - We just started.

1478
00:57:27,866 --> 00:57:29,467
I'll spoon out a lot since it's only the start.

1479
00:57:30,235 --> 00:57:31,302
Right. We just began.

1480
00:57:31,302 --> 00:57:33,605
She looks great when she eats.

1481
00:57:33,705 --> 00:57:35,607
- Look at that. - Goodness.

1482
00:57:35,707 --> 00:57:37,308
She knows how to eat.

1483
00:57:37,308 --> 00:57:39,043
(The way she eats brings good luck.)

1484
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:41,246
(She's a fairy who knows how to eat.)

1485
00:57:41,946 --> 00:57:44,415
- Is it tasty? - Look at her eyes. She likes it.

1486
00:57:44,482 --> 00:57:46,684
- Min Yong is next. - Are we alternating?

1487
00:57:46,684 --> 00:57:49,220
- I played this a lot with soil. - You did?

1488
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,688
He said he was good at this.

1489
00:57:50,688 --> 00:57:52,190
Min Yong. You have to eat what you spoon out.

1490
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:53,791
(He penetrates into the middle.)

1491
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:55,059
It's steaming.

1492
00:57:55,059 --> 00:57:57,996
Why did you scoop out the inner part?

1493
00:57:57,996 --> 00:57:59,864
- It's warm inside. - This looks awkward now.

1494
00:58:00,331 --> 00:58:01,666
- Kwang Soo, you are up. - All right.

1495
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:03,768
I think it needs some sesame oil.

1496
00:58:04,369 --> 00:58:05,703
It's only the beginning.

1497
00:58:05,703 --> 00:58:07,338
(He deeply breaks into the inner part.)

1498
00:58:08,506 --> 00:58:09,507
(He opens his mouth wide.)

1499
00:58:09,507 --> 00:58:12,043
- Kwang Soo has a huge mouth. - He's like a crocodile.

1500
00:58:12,043 --> 00:58:14,145
- He's like a crocodile. - He is.

1501
00:58:14,145 --> 00:58:18,049
- I'm not like a crocodile. - He's a snake.

1502
00:58:18,049 --> 00:58:20,451
(They have to be careful. How would Seok Jin do it?)

1503
00:58:20,451 --> 00:58:22,954
- It's so good. - Take more.

1504
00:58:22,954 --> 00:58:25,023
(He scrapes a little bit.)

1505
00:58:25,256 --> 00:58:28,326
- That's so cheap. Take some more. - It's good.

1506
00:58:28,326 --> 00:58:31,729
- It's up to me. This is a lot. - My goodness.

1507
00:58:31,763 --> 00:58:34,198
- You're barely licking it. - You have to do what you promised.

1508
00:58:34,198 --> 00:58:35,566
It's good but I'm full.

1509
00:58:35,566 --> 00:58:37,135
(The real game starts now.)

1510
00:58:37,135 --> 00:58:38,503
You have to take this much at least.

1511
00:58:38,937 --> 00:58:40,138
(Gobbling)

1512
00:58:40,538 --> 00:58:41,739
That looks messy.

1513
00:58:41,739 --> 00:58:43,308
(I'll win and fill my belly too.)

1514
00:58:43,308 --> 00:58:46,411
- Good job. - It's sticky so it won't fall.

1515
00:58:46,711 --> 00:58:48,846
(She must digest fast.)

1516
00:58:48,846 --> 00:58:49,914
Take more.

1517
00:58:49,948 --> 00:58:52,383
(The rice tower gradually gets smaller.)

1518
00:58:52,383 --> 00:58:54,385
(The chopstick is not stable now.)

1519
00:58:54,385 --> 00:58:56,254
It tastes even better now.

1520
00:58:56,254 --> 00:58:59,557
- Can you eat this much, Bo Mi? - You eat a lot.

1521
00:58:59,557 --> 00:59:01,292
(The game will end soon.)

1522
00:59:02,193 --> 00:59:04,062
(It's Bo Mi's turn again.)

1523
00:59:04,062 --> 00:59:05,763
You eat a lot.

1524
00:59:05,763 --> 00:59:08,166
(A small movement may decide who loses the game.)

1525
00:59:08,166 --> 00:59:10,601
(She has to focus on the spoon...)

1526
00:59:10,601 --> 00:59:11,602
(and save the chopstick in the middle.)

1527
00:59:11,602 --> 00:59:14,939
- She's so good. - You can't say anything to her.

1528
00:59:14,939 --> 00:59:17,608
- Why? She's so good. - We don't have anything to say.

1529
00:59:17,608 --> 00:59:20,578
- What should we say? - She's good.

1530
00:59:20,578 --> 00:59:23,047
(Bo Mi is saved.)

1531
00:59:23,047 --> 00:59:25,650
(She takes a big spoon and makes it tough for the next person.)

1532
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:26,651
(Let's see her eat.)

1533
00:59:26,651 --> 00:59:27,752
What's wrong?

1534
00:59:27,919 --> 00:59:29,954
(It's Bo Mi's eating time.)

1535
00:59:29,954 --> 00:59:31,956
- Good job. - Thank you.

1536
00:59:31,956 --> 00:59:33,458
(It's about to topple over.)

1537
00:59:33,825 --> 00:59:36,027
(Don't you like what I did?)

1538
00:59:36,027 --> 00:59:38,696
(It's Min Yong's turn.)

1539
00:59:38,696 --> 00:59:40,999
Why would you compete over this?

1540
00:59:41,399 --> 00:59:42,467
Hey, hey.

1541
00:59:42,767 --> 00:59:43,835
(Pushing)

1542
00:59:43,868 --> 00:59:45,436
- Keep going. It's okay. - Do it.

1543
00:59:45,436 --> 00:59:47,939
(Keep going, Min Yong.)

1544
00:59:47,939 --> 00:59:49,540
- Keep going. - Do it.

1545
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:51,409
(He doesn't know anymore.)

1546
00:59:51,409 --> 00:59:52,744
- Good. - It's okay.

1547
00:59:52,744 --> 00:59:55,213
(He's bold like when he's shoveling.)

1548
00:59:55,213 --> 00:59:57,648
(How would this long game end?)

1549
00:59:58,483 --> 00:59:59,584
- Good job. - Hey.

1550
01:00:00,418 --> 01:00:01,853
(Falling)

1551
01:00:01,853 --> 01:00:04,689
(The tower falls apart.)

1552
01:00:04,689 --> 01:00:06,157
(What did you do?)

1553
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:09,560
(He messed up.)

1554
01:00:11,462 --> 01:00:13,464
You said you were good.

1555
01:00:13,464 --> 01:00:16,034
(Team Jong Kook wins all the games.)

1556
01:00:16,434 --> 01:00:17,602
You barely scraped it.

1557
01:00:17,602 --> 01:00:19,037
(I want to turn back time.)

1558
01:00:19,037 --> 01:00:21,439
I'm sick of this now.

1559
01:00:21,439 --> 01:00:23,141
- I'm good at this. - Really?

1560
01:00:23,141 --> 01:00:25,810
(He said he's good in shoveling.)

1561
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:29,747
(He was all talk.)

1562
01:00:29,747 --> 01:00:32,683
(He made his team lose with just two turns.)

1563
01:00:32,683 --> 01:00:34,952
(Isn't he a spy?)

1564
01:00:34,952 --> 01:00:36,654
(They're sick of winning now.)

1565
01:00:36,654 --> 01:00:38,556
- You said you were good. - He's really bad.

1566
01:00:38,556 --> 01:00:41,059
(He was all talk and he messed up.)

1567
01:00:41,059 --> 01:00:43,294
- Are you a spy? - He must be.

1568
01:00:43,294 --> 01:00:46,130
(I want to go back home.)

1569
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:51,302
We're going to head to the giant claw crane in SBS lobby.

1570
01:00:51,302 --> 01:00:52,904
- Claw crane. - I saw it.

1571
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:58,042
(Team Jong Kook gets 2 tries for winning and Team Jae Seok gets 1.)

1572
01:00:58,042 --> 01:01:00,645
- We'll win this one for sure. - Are you sure?

1573
01:01:00,645 --> 01:01:03,648
It's not just any ordinary claw crane.

1574
01:01:03,648 --> 01:01:07,051
You can put a name tag of a person inside the claw crane...

1575
01:01:07,051 --> 01:01:10,054
and if you pick the stuffed toy with their name on it,

1576
01:01:10,054 --> 01:01:12,356
they come to your team.

1577
01:01:12,356 --> 01:01:14,659
- We have to pick Bo Mi then. - We do.

1578
01:01:14,659 --> 01:01:16,694
- She has the hint. - We need to get Min Yong.

1579
01:01:16,694 --> 01:01:18,262
(1 hour ago on their way to have braised spicy chicken)

1580
01:01:18,262 --> 01:01:21,299
I'm the guest here but I don't know what the hint is.

1581
01:01:21,299 --> 01:01:23,034
(They're supposed to know something.)

1582
01:01:23,034 --> 01:01:25,303
- Do you know what it is? - No, I don't.

1583
01:01:25,603 --> 01:01:28,940
- You do know. - It must be hidden somewhere.

1584
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:31,209
- You might not know it yet. - Do I...

1585
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:34,312
- What are you doing? - Do I...

1586
01:01:34,645 --> 01:01:36,247
(Coffee Min Yong)

1587
01:01:37,281 --> 01:01:39,517
(This is a real situation.)

1588
01:01:39,684 --> 01:01:43,754
- What are you doing? - I ripped to check. It's a hint.

1589
01:01:43,955 --> 01:01:46,524
(That's what it was.)

1590
01:01:46,524 --> 01:01:48,759
(It's better to have guests on their teams.)

1591
01:01:48,759 --> 01:01:50,161
- That startled me. - Then we...

1592
01:01:50,161 --> 01:01:52,964
(I need to win so that I take Bo Mi's item as well.)

1593
01:01:54,432 --> 01:01:57,502
- I have a claw crane at home. - Forget it.

1594
01:01:57,502 --> 01:02:00,705
(I have a claw crane at home.)

1595
01:02:00,705 --> 01:02:02,240
(That hurt him.)

1596
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,909
- Stop it. - It's about time.

1597
01:02:04,942 --> 01:02:07,445
- He's persistent. He keeps going. - He's flustered.

1598
01:02:07,445 --> 01:02:10,348
- I know you now. - How shameless.

1599
01:02:10,348 --> 01:02:12,850
- Is it the claw type? - We have to get Bo Mi.

1600
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:14,652
- It is. - Okay. Let's go.

1601
01:02:14,652 --> 01:02:16,320
(That's a piece of cake.)

1602
01:02:17,421 --> 01:02:20,691
You saw it, right? I have one at home.

1603
01:02:20,691 --> 01:02:23,961
- I have the same one at home. - It's small though.

1604
01:02:23,961 --> 01:02:26,330
It's the same principle.

1605
01:02:27,064 --> 01:02:28,966
(He keeps on flaunting.)

1606
01:02:28,966 --> 01:02:31,402
He flaunts. He flaunts so much.

1607
01:02:31,402 --> 01:02:34,038
What does the rice tower have to do with a sand tower?

1608
01:02:34,038 --> 01:02:38,009
Rice and sand are very different. I didn't realize.

1609
01:02:38,009 --> 01:02:39,944
Rice is stickier.

1610
01:02:39,944 --> 01:02:41,846
(He's not appreciated by his team.)

1611
01:02:41,846 --> 01:02:43,714
Let's get going first.

1612
01:02:43,814 --> 01:02:45,416
Fine. Go.

1613
01:02:46,584 --> 01:02:49,387
I'm lonely, Haha.

1614
01:02:49,921 --> 01:02:51,255
He's lonely.

1615
01:02:51,255 --> 01:02:52,456
(Their last mission will be held in SBS.)

1616
01:02:52,456 --> 01:02:54,959
- This is it. - It's huge.

1617
01:02:54,959 --> 01:02:56,327
(Have you seen a gigantic claw crane before?)

1618
01:02:56,327 --> 01:02:57,695
(It's made of a huge box that's 4m tall.)

1619
01:02:57,695 --> 01:02:59,297
I haven't seen one this big.

1620
01:02:59,497 --> 01:03:00,965
It's huge.

1621
01:03:00,965 --> 01:03:04,468
- This looks so difficult. - It looks fun.

1622
01:03:04,468 --> 01:03:07,138
I have a problem. It's not the one I have at home.

1623
01:03:07,238 --> 01:03:08,506
(He's scared by how big it is.)

1624
01:03:08,506 --> 01:03:10,708
I have this small one at home.

1625
01:03:11,209 --> 01:03:12,643
Come on, Min Yong.

1626
01:03:12,643 --> 01:03:14,946
All right. I'll explain the rules.

1627
01:03:14,946 --> 01:03:17,348
Jong Kook will start.

1628
01:03:17,348 --> 01:03:19,650
There's a name tag on each stuffed toy.

1629
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:23,020
It has Min Yong's name. If you win the stuffed toy,

1630
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:26,057
he comes to your team.

1631
01:03:26,524 --> 01:03:29,560
The name tag will change to Bo Mi's after.

1632
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,862
- Then the other team can go. - Okay.

1633
01:03:31,862 --> 01:03:34,031
Go ahead, Jong Kook.

1634
01:03:34,031 --> 01:03:36,467
- Who's going to go? - Each person can go once.

1635
01:03:36,467 --> 01:03:40,238
- Should we? - Do the one that's closest to you.

1636
01:03:40,238 --> 01:03:41,639
It's not easy.

1637
01:03:41,639 --> 01:03:43,241
(They take their time to pick the target.)

1638
01:03:43,241 --> 01:03:44,709
- Is this better? - Yes, it is.

1639
01:03:45,209 --> 01:03:46,944
(Jong Kook's 1st attempt)

1640
01:03:46,944 --> 01:03:49,247
- There's a time limit. - Does this even work?

1641
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,381
(Let's look around.)

1642
01:03:50,381 --> 01:03:52,083
This is so huge.

1643
01:03:52,283 --> 01:03:54,485
- He won't be able to do it. - This is impossible.

1644
01:03:54,485 --> 01:03:57,488
- It's impossible. - There's seven seconds left.

1645
01:03:57,488 --> 01:04:00,057
- You have 6 seconds. - 5. Go right.

1646
01:04:00,057 --> 01:04:01,392
(He gets ready to press the button.)

1647
01:04:01,392 --> 01:04:03,394
- It's a fail. - I got it.

1648
01:04:03,394 --> 01:04:06,063
It won't work. Where are you aiming it?

1649
01:04:06,063 --> 01:04:08,766
(Will they get Min Yong or not? That is the question.)

1650
01:04:08,766 --> 01:04:11,669
(Will Jong Kook succeed?)

1651
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:16,440
- I got it. - It won't work.

1652
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,042
- Please. - It needs to be positioned well.

1653
01:04:18,042 --> 01:04:19,210
(Min Yong is nervous as well.)

1654
01:04:19,243 --> 01:04:21,345
- Please. - It needs to be positioned well.

1655
01:04:21,345 --> 01:04:23,414
- It won't work. - Okay.

1656
01:04:23,414 --> 01:04:26,417
(He got it.)

1657
01:04:26,417 --> 01:04:29,487
(It has to reach the hole.)

1658
01:04:29,487 --> 01:04:33,557
(Where would Min Yong end up?)

1659
01:04:33,557 --> 01:04:36,861
- Please. - You have to get the legs.

1660
01:04:36,861 --> 01:04:39,297
- Okay. - He got it.

1661
01:04:39,297 --> 01:04:40,464
It didn't work.

1662
01:04:40,464 --> 01:04:43,367
(It falls within a second.)

1663
01:04:43,768 --> 01:04:44,769
It didn't work.

1664
01:04:44,769 --> 01:04:46,070
(It's not easy to succeed at once.)

1665
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:47,405
- That's right. - Go for that one.

1666
01:04:47,405 --> 01:04:48,939
(Last try goes to Kwang Soo.)

1667
01:04:48,939 --> 01:04:51,309
Didn't you see that? I told you to move back a bit.

1668
01:04:51,309 --> 01:04:53,844
- You should have moved it. - Worry about yourselves.

1669
01:04:53,844 --> 01:04:55,012
(Let's see how good you are.)

1670
01:04:55,012 --> 01:04:56,847
- Are you mad? - It was just too close.

1671
01:04:56,847 --> 01:04:58,749
We just need Bo Mi.

1672
01:04:58,749 --> 01:05:01,052
- Bo Mi! - Wait for us.

1673
01:05:01,052 --> 01:05:03,954
(It's their last chance to get Min Yong on their team.)

1674
01:05:03,954 --> 01:05:06,657
- In 8, 7, 6... - Why?

1675
01:05:06,657 --> 01:05:08,759
(The counting down makes him nervous.)

1676
01:05:08,759 --> 01:05:11,762
- You have enough time. - They're done.

1677
01:05:11,762 --> 01:05:13,597
- It won't work. - It's not easy.

1678
01:05:13,597 --> 01:05:14,765
(Time is now.)

1679
01:05:14,765 --> 01:05:17,468
- Please. - He's in a perfect position.

1680
01:05:17,468 --> 01:05:20,471
- It's a good position. - It's perfect.

1681
01:05:20,905 --> 01:05:22,606
(I have a good feeling.)

1682
01:05:22,606 --> 01:05:25,042
- You got it. - Looking good.

1683
01:05:25,042 --> 01:05:29,113
(He may be unlucky but this looks perfect.)

1684
01:05:29,113 --> 01:05:33,050
It's difficult to win in a few tries.

1685
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:37,355
(Will they get the stuffed toy with Min Yong's name on it?)

1686
01:05:37,655 --> 01:05:38,756
It's going to work.

1687
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:41,258
- He got it. - It's difficult to win.

1688
01:05:41,425 --> 01:05:42,426
It's going up!

1689
01:05:42,426 --> 01:05:44,862
(He picks it up.)

1690
01:05:44,862 --> 01:05:46,664
- He got it. - Please.

1691
01:05:46,664 --> 01:05:48,799
(Would he be lucky just for today?)

1692
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,502
(Please hold on until the stuffed toy gets released.)

1693
01:05:51,502 --> 01:05:54,705
(What would be the result of this game?)

1694
01:05:54,705 --> 01:05:55,840
Please.

1695
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,141
(Slipping)

1696
01:05:57,141 --> 01:05:59,009
(Collapsing)

1697
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:02,847
(The claw is unlucky like Kwang Soo.)

1698
01:06:02,847 --> 01:06:04,115
(His bad luck will last forever.)

1699
01:06:04,115 --> 01:06:05,950
It's difficult to win in a few tries.

1700
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:08,252
(Team Jong Kook fails.)

1701
01:06:08,252 --> 01:06:10,488
- Okay. - It's difficult with two tries.

1702
01:06:10,488 --> 01:06:13,124
- We are done now. - Do you want to give it a try?

1703
01:06:13,124 --> 01:06:17,228
- Should I? It has to be standing. - I'll look for you.

1704
01:06:17,228 --> 01:06:19,397
Let's go for the one at the front. We don't have much options.

1705
01:06:19,397 --> 01:06:23,033
- Do you want to go for that one? - How much time do I have? This one.

1706
01:06:23,033 --> 01:06:24,468
(He finds his target.)

1707
01:06:24,468 --> 01:06:25,469
Okay!

1708
01:06:25,603 --> 01:06:27,438
- This one? - Yes.

1709
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:30,608
- Should I go forward? - You're good on this side.

1710
01:06:31,509 --> 01:06:33,310
(He presses the button.)

1711
01:06:35,112 --> 01:06:38,015
(It goes down for Bo Mi's name.)

1712
01:06:39,116 --> 01:06:41,952
(What will happen to her?)

1713
01:06:41,952 --> 01:06:44,855
- Good. - It dodged.

1714
01:06:45,322 --> 01:06:48,692
- Good. - It's a perfect grip.

1715
01:06:48,692 --> 01:06:50,828
(He has a good feeling.)

1716
01:06:51,695 --> 01:06:53,264
(It's a perfect grip.)

1717
01:06:53,264 --> 01:06:54,565
I have a good feeling about this.

1718
01:06:55,332 --> 01:06:56,667
- Good. - I think we are done.

1719
01:06:56,667 --> 01:06:58,369
(It starts to move.)

1720
01:06:58,369 --> 01:07:01,639
(It just has to reach the hole.)

1721
01:07:01,639 --> 01:07:05,743
(They only have one chance to bring Bo Mi to their team.)

1722
01:07:05,743 --> 01:07:07,378
(His heart is thumping.)

1723
01:07:07,445 --> 01:07:09,313
- Okay! - Please.

1724
01:07:09,313 --> 01:07:12,049
(This claw crane will decide the two teams' fates.)

1725
01:07:12,049 --> 01:07:14,552
(Please hold on.)

1726
01:07:14,552 --> 01:07:15,753
(Her heart is racing.)

1727
01:07:15,753 --> 01:07:17,354
- Please. - No, Bo Mi.

1728
01:07:17,354 --> 01:07:20,925
(That's the exit hole.)

1729
01:07:21,392 --> 01:07:23,027
- Okay. - No way.

1730
01:07:23,027 --> 01:07:24,028
(Sliding)

1731
01:07:25,062 --> 01:07:27,031
(Team Jong Kook tries to protect Bo Mi,)

1732
01:07:27,031 --> 01:07:29,266
(and Team Jae Seok tries to steal her. This is the last game.)

1733
01:07:29,266 --> 01:07:30,968
Please, Ji Hyo.

1734
01:07:30,968 --> 01:07:33,471
(The team with the guests have the upper hand for the last mission.)

1735
01:07:33,471 --> 01:07:35,940
(Who will win this game?)

1736
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:38,809
- No, Bo Mi. - You can't take her.

1737
01:07:39,410 --> 01:07:41,345
- Please, Ji Hyo. - We got it.

1738
01:07:41,345 --> 01:07:42,913
No, Bo Mi.

1739
01:07:42,913 --> 01:07:44,548
(Dropping)

1740
01:07:44,548 --> 01:07:45,549
(They got it.)

1741
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:48,953
(Team Jae Seok gets Bo Mi in one try.)

1742
01:07:48,953 --> 01:07:51,455
(This turns the game around.)

1743
01:07:51,489 --> 01:07:54,358
- We did it. - We got it.

1744
01:07:54,358 --> 01:07:56,827
(Bo Mi gets transferred to Team Jae Seok.)

1745
01:07:56,827 --> 01:07:59,763
- What just happened? - Come here, Bo Mi.

1746
01:07:59,763 --> 01:08:01,765
- Sure. - Come here.

1747
01:08:01,765 --> 01:08:03,701
(They have both Min Yong and Bo Mi.)

1748
01:08:03,701 --> 01:08:06,070
(How would this race end?)

1749
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:07,938
- We're in the same team now. - You look so happy, Bo Mi.

1750
01:08:07,938 --> 01:08:09,106
Give her a jacket.

1751
01:08:09,406 --> 01:08:10,741
Give her our pink jacket.

1752
01:08:10,741 --> 01:08:12,910
Bo Mi joins our team at last.

1753
01:08:12,943 --> 01:08:15,279
Here are the guest members' secrets.

1754
01:08:15,579 --> 01:08:18,215
Take off the guests' name tags.

1755
01:08:18,716 --> 01:08:20,284
Can we do it in the open?

1756
01:08:20,885 --> 01:08:21,986
(He takes it off.)

1757
01:08:22,052 --> 01:08:23,120
"Chocolate Bo Mi"?

1758
01:08:23,721 --> 01:08:24,788
- "Coffee Min Yong". - "Coffee Min Yong".

1759
01:08:24,788 --> 01:08:26,624
- Chocolate Bo Mi, Coffee Min Yong. - What's this?

1760
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:30,928
You'll play Hide and Seek to obtain ingredients you need.

1761
01:08:31,228 --> 01:08:32,263
Hide and Seek?

1762
01:08:32,263 --> 01:08:33,364
That sounds fun.

1763
01:08:33,364 --> 01:08:38,035
The teams will take turns with the time limit of five minutes.

1764
01:08:38,068 --> 01:08:41,138
The team must seek the other team that's hiding.

1765
01:08:41,438 --> 01:08:45,376
If you take off a name tag, you obtain the ingredient written on it.

1766
01:08:45,376 --> 01:08:47,211
How many ingredients can one person attach?

1767
01:08:47,444 --> 01:08:49,380
- It's up to you. - Really?

1768
01:08:49,446 --> 01:08:53,217
The perimeter is limited to the first floor lobby.

1769
01:08:53,317 --> 01:08:55,219
- Is it here? - It's in the lobby.

1770
01:08:55,219 --> 01:08:57,254
- Where can we hide? - Is there a place to hide?

1771
01:08:58,155 --> 01:08:59,590
Determine the order.

1772
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:01,258
What should we do?

1773
01:09:01,825 --> 01:09:04,562
- We have to be strategic. - How?

1774
01:09:04,995 --> 01:09:08,465
It's not about running away. It's important to hide well.

1775
01:09:08,465 --> 01:09:11,769
Let's put all the ingredients on Ji Hyo and Bo Mi.

1776
01:09:11,969 --> 01:09:13,137
- All of them? - Yes.

1777
01:09:13,137 --> 01:09:14,638
Isn't it better to have one each?

1778
01:09:14,638 --> 01:09:15,940
Two is better.

1779
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:17,007
Will it be dangerous?

1780
01:09:17,007 --> 01:09:18,909
- How about Min Yong? - Do you want one?

1781
01:09:18,909 --> 01:09:20,244
It's better to have one each.

1782
01:09:20,244 --> 01:09:22,513
- Do I have to hide? - Let's get one each.

1783
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:25,716
You can hide amongst the stuffed animals.

1784
01:09:25,816 --> 01:09:29,286
The other team will definitely consider it.

1785
01:09:29,653 --> 01:09:31,155
There aren't good places to hide.

1786
01:09:31,155 --> 01:09:32,323
(Kwang Soo has a hard time hiding.)

1787
01:09:32,323 --> 01:09:34,959
How about above the claw crane?

1788
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:36,293
Can I climb up?

1789
01:09:36,527 --> 01:09:39,063
What's that behind?

1790
01:09:39,296 --> 01:09:41,599
There's a ladder.

1791
01:09:41,599 --> 01:09:44,068
We can climb up if there's a ladder.

1792
01:09:44,335 --> 01:09:45,436
Look.

1793
01:09:46,036 --> 01:09:48,439
We can fold the ladder after climbing up.

1794
01:09:48,439 --> 01:09:50,307
(Remove the ladder after using it.)

1795
01:09:51,241 --> 01:09:52,509
Attach everything on me.

1796
01:09:53,377 --> 01:09:56,647
No one can climb up without the ladder.

1797
01:09:56,647 --> 01:09:58,649
- Okay. - Should I take the ladder?

1798
01:09:59,316 --> 01:10:00,317
(Hide and Seek Round One starts.)

1799
01:10:00,317 --> 01:10:02,419
- Can you carry the ladder? - Once...

1800
01:10:02,553 --> 01:10:05,089
we remove their name tags, we can win.

1801
01:10:05,089 --> 01:10:06,357
Remove all their name tags.

1802
01:10:06,624 --> 01:10:09,059
Try to finish the game in round one.

1803
01:10:09,493 --> 01:10:11,061
We have more members, so we have an advantage.

1804
01:10:12,329 --> 01:10:13,497
(The hiding team has two minutes.)

1805
01:10:13,497 --> 01:10:16,033
It'll be fun.

1806
01:10:16,033 --> 01:10:18,268
- Do we start? - Yes.

1807
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:20,938
Will you be okay?

1808
01:10:21,605 --> 01:10:24,208
- Hold it tight. - Okay, I will.

1809
01:10:24,208 --> 01:10:25,809
(Haha is bolder than before.)

1810
01:10:25,909 --> 01:10:26,910
Can you do it?

1811
01:10:26,910 --> 01:10:29,880
- There's a hole. - In the ladder?

1812
01:10:30,948 --> 01:10:33,017
- Move more to the side. - There's a hole.

1813
01:10:33,017 --> 01:10:35,386
(It's a big hole.)

1814
01:10:35,653 --> 01:10:36,887
What should we do?

1815
01:10:36,887 --> 01:10:37,888
(We're doomed.)

1816
01:10:38,055 --> 01:10:40,157
- What do we do? - Isn't it too high?

1817
01:10:41,225 --> 01:10:42,359
What should we do?

1818
01:10:42,926 --> 01:10:44,995
How about that coffee shop?

1819
01:10:45,462 --> 01:10:48,465
- Should we lift it up? - We can go inside for a while.

1820
01:10:48,699 --> 01:10:49,800
Thank you.

1821
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,402
Should we go inside?

1822
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:54,938
(They enter the coffee shop.)

1823
01:10:58,709 --> 01:10:59,710
(He finds a space to hide.)

1824
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:01,111
I'll hide in here.

1825
01:11:02,713 --> 01:11:04,281
(Haha finishes hiding.)

1826
01:11:04,281 --> 01:11:06,050
No one will find you here.

1827
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:07,451
Should we split the items?

1828
01:11:07,551 --> 01:11:09,887
Let's split them.

1829
01:11:09,887 --> 01:11:12,256
(They split the ingredients.)

1830
01:11:12,256 --> 01:11:13,290
Rice.

1831
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:18,862
(Jong Kook, Haha, and Kwang Soo each get ingredients.)

1832
01:11:18,862 --> 01:11:20,631
You have one minute.

1833
01:11:20,631 --> 01:11:22,332
Please hide within one minute.

1834
01:11:22,332 --> 01:11:23,600
(1 minute remains.)

1835
01:11:24,301 --> 01:11:26,670
(Kwang Soo finds something behind the coffee shop.)

1836
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:29,440
(He finds a podium.)

1837
01:11:30,207 --> 01:11:33,711
(He carries it with ease.)

1838
01:11:34,611 --> 01:11:38,282
(He passes the staff members and places the podium...)

1839
01:11:38,282 --> 01:11:41,185
(at an awkward place.)

1840
01:11:43,954 --> 01:11:46,323
Please start now. Hurry.

1841
01:11:47,858 --> 01:11:50,728
(Jong Kook finishes hiding Haha.)

1842
01:11:50,728 --> 01:11:52,062
Make sure no one can see me.

1843
01:11:52,629 --> 01:11:53,664
Okay.

1844
01:11:53,664 --> 01:11:55,632
(Haha's recording)

1845
01:11:57,735 --> 01:12:00,738
(Surprisingly, Haha is hiding in here.)

1846
01:12:00,738 --> 01:12:02,439
(He's fully hidden.)

1847
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,509
(He has 15 seconds left.)

1848
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:08,879
(Jong Kook's physique is difficult to hide.)

1849
01:12:08,879 --> 01:12:11,882
(He hides in front of the elevator.)

1850
01:12:14,051 --> 01:12:15,986
(The hiding team is ready.)

1851
01:12:15,986 --> 01:12:18,388
Please start now. Hurry.

1852
01:12:18,722 --> 01:12:20,057
Is everyone hiding?

1853
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:22,826
The hiding team should be hidden by now.

1854
01:12:22,826 --> 01:12:24,361
Let's finish in one round.

1855
01:12:24,361 --> 01:12:26,029
- Do we have 5 minutes? - Let's finish in 1 go.

1856
01:12:26,029 --> 01:12:27,097
Let's do that.

1857
01:12:27,264 --> 01:12:31,235
In 5, 4, 3,

1858
01:12:31,335 --> 01:12:32,503
- 2... - Finish it in 1 go.

1859
01:12:34,371 --> 01:12:36,440
(The seeking team starts.)

1860
01:12:39,009 --> 01:12:41,445
(Ji Hyo moves towards Kwang Soo.)

1861
01:12:41,445 --> 01:12:42,546
We have five minutes.

1862
01:12:44,047 --> 01:12:47,918
(She knows Kwang Soo usually hides behind staff members.)

1863
01:12:48,352 --> 01:12:50,788
(Please don't come here.)

1864
01:12:51,155 --> 01:12:53,624
(Will Ji Hyo spot Kwang Soo?)

1865
01:12:53,624 --> 01:12:54,758
(She turns around.)

1866
01:12:57,694 --> 01:12:58,829
Act naturally.

1867
01:13:00,831 --> 01:13:02,199
We have five minutes.

1868
01:13:02,199 --> 01:13:03,467
(The seeking team speeds up.)

1869
01:13:04,234 --> 01:13:06,737
(Min Yong searches the claw crane.)

1870
01:13:07,171 --> 01:13:08,238
No one is here.

1871
01:13:08,438 --> 01:13:10,007
(Where is everyone?)

1872
01:13:10,007 --> 01:13:11,008
I can't find anyone.

1873
01:13:12,142 --> 01:13:16,046
(Jae Seok approaches where Jong Kook is hiding.)

1874
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,950
(He searches near the reception desk.)

1875
01:13:20,651 --> 01:13:23,020
(He suddenly turns around.)

1876
01:13:23,554 --> 01:13:28,158
(Is he heading towards where Jong Kook is hiding?)

1877
01:13:32,996 --> 01:13:35,632
He's right here.

1878
01:13:35,766 --> 01:13:38,769
- I found you. Here he is. - I knew it.

1879
01:13:38,769 --> 01:13:41,104
I got Jong Kook and rice.

1880
01:13:41,538 --> 01:13:43,740
I got rice. I found Jong Kook.

1881
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:44,808
Catch him.

1882
01:13:45,309 --> 01:13:46,410
We don't have time.

1883
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:49,046
He caught Jong Kook.

1884
01:13:49,646 --> 01:13:50,781
Where are the others?

1885
01:13:51,114 --> 01:13:52,216
Catch him.

1886
01:13:52,583 --> 01:13:53,784
We don't have time.

1887
01:13:53,784 --> 01:13:55,919
(Kwang Soo is right here.)

1888
01:13:56,753 --> 01:13:58,622
(He turns around again.)

1889
01:13:59,523 --> 01:14:02,226
(Is someone else hiding behind the podium?)

1890
01:14:02,226 --> 01:14:05,062
(Kwang Soo is at risk of being found.)

1891
01:14:05,062 --> 01:14:07,731
(What will happen to Kwang Soo with barley?)

1892
01:14:07,865 --> 01:14:09,032
Here's Kwang Soo.

1893
01:14:09,032 --> 01:14:10,834
(He finds Kwang Soo.)

1894
01:14:10,834 --> 01:14:12,002
Here's Kwang Soo.

1895
01:14:13,403 --> 01:14:15,038
- I found him. - How did you know?

1896
01:14:15,038 --> 01:14:17,140
- We just need to find Haha. - How did you find me?

1897
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:18,408
We need to find Haha.

1898
01:14:18,508 --> 01:14:20,510
- I got barley. - He's good at finding people.

1899
01:14:20,611 --> 01:14:23,213
- We need to find Haha. - We only need to find Haha.

1900
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:24,915
It's over once we find Haha.

1901
01:14:25,382 --> 01:14:27,684
You have two minutes left.

1902
01:14:27,851 --> 01:14:29,486
We only need to find Haha.

1903
01:14:29,786 --> 01:14:32,456
(They won't find where Haha is hiding.)

1904
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:35,158
We only need to find Haha.

1905
01:14:35,158 --> 01:14:36,360
How did he find me?

1906
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,928
(Haha is struggling inside a trash bag.)

1907
01:14:39,696 --> 01:14:41,832
(The game is over once Haha is found.)

1908
01:14:41,832 --> 01:14:43,066
Here are the staff members.

1909
01:14:44,868 --> 01:14:46,403
He's too small to find.

1910
01:14:46,403 --> 01:14:47,738
(He gets anxious.)

1911
01:14:47,738 --> 01:14:48,906
Where's Haha?

1912
01:14:48,939 --> 01:14:50,240
It's hard to find him.

1913
01:14:51,108 --> 01:14:53,377
Haha should have kept all the ingredients.

1914
01:14:53,377 --> 01:14:54,444
Bo Mi.

1915
01:14:54,645 --> 01:14:57,447
Check inside the women's restroom.

1916
01:14:57,814 --> 01:15:00,250
It's difficult to find where Haha is hiding.

1917
01:15:00,651 --> 01:15:03,253
He should have kept them all.

1918
01:15:03,253 --> 01:15:04,721
(It's challenging to find Haha.)

1919
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:07,925
Where did he go?

1920
01:15:07,925 --> 01:15:09,693
(They looked almost everywhere.)

1921
01:15:10,294 --> 01:15:14,498
(Jae Seok senses something and approaches the coffee shop.)

1922
01:15:14,498 --> 01:15:16,099
(Is that Seok Jin?)

1923
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:17,334
I'm sorry.

1924
01:15:18,402 --> 01:15:19,770
May I take a look?

1925
01:15:20,304 --> 01:15:21,505
I'm sorry.

1926
01:15:21,505 --> 01:15:23,040
(No way.)

1927
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,108
I'm sorry.

1928
01:15:25,108 --> 01:15:27,110
(Haha is in trouble.)

1929
01:15:29,446 --> 01:15:30,914
May I take a look?

1930
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:34,818
May I take a look?

1931
01:15:37,454 --> 01:15:39,990
(Seok Jin is in front of Haha.)

1932
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:43,860
(Once Haha is found, Team Jong Kook loses.)

1933
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:45,295
(What will happen to him?)

1934
01:15:45,629 --> 01:15:46,730
He's not here.

1935
01:15:46,730 --> 01:15:47,798
(He gives up quickly.)

1936
01:15:48,865 --> 01:15:51,168
(Haha is relieved.)

1937
01:15:53,537 --> 01:15:54,638
(They have 10 seconds left.)

1938
01:15:54,638 --> 01:15:56,540
In 9, 8...

1939
01:15:56,807 --> 01:15:59,710
Have you seen Haha?

1940
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:00,811
(Min Yong gets desperate.)

1941
01:16:02,312 --> 01:16:04,481
(He's frustrated.)

1942
01:16:04,481 --> 01:16:05,549
Where is he?

1943
01:16:05,782 --> 01:16:07,617
I can't check inside the claw crane.

1944
01:16:07,617 --> 01:16:08,752
(Time is up.)

1945
01:16:08,752 --> 01:16:10,320
I can't find him.

1946
01:16:11,755 --> 01:16:12,756
I couldn't find him.

1947
01:16:14,324 --> 01:16:15,392
Okay.

1948
01:16:15,392 --> 01:16:17,527
(Haha survives.)

1949
01:16:18,261 --> 01:16:19,730
(He returns in glory.)

1950
01:16:19,730 --> 01:16:20,764
I did it.

1951
01:16:21,598 --> 01:16:23,467
I did it.

1952
01:16:23,467 --> 01:16:24,835
(Team Jong Kook wins seafood and peanuts.)

1953
01:16:24,835 --> 01:16:27,404
Haha should have kept all the items.

1954
01:16:27,404 --> 01:16:28,872
That was amazing.

1955
01:16:28,939 --> 01:16:30,440
We'll keep one each.

1956
01:16:30,507 --> 01:16:31,608
Each person keeps two.

1957
01:16:31,942 --> 01:16:33,010
You keep it.

1958
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:34,711
I found a place that's hard to find.

1959
01:16:34,711 --> 01:16:36,380
- You should hide there. - All right.

1960
01:16:36,513 --> 01:16:38,415
- Aren't you keeping one? - No, I won't.

1961
01:16:38,548 --> 01:16:40,584
- Shouldn't we keep one each? - I'll disappoint them.

1962
01:16:40,984 --> 01:16:43,120
- Really? - They'll get exhausted too.

1963
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,956
They'll be disappointed to find that I have nothing.

1964
01:16:46,456 --> 01:16:48,692
- Let's find all of them. - Will we win?

1965
01:16:48,692 --> 01:16:49,726
We have to find them all.

1966
01:16:50,594 --> 01:16:51,962
- Let's hide. - They won't find me.

1967
01:16:51,962 --> 01:16:53,764
We can do it.

1968
01:16:53,764 --> 01:16:55,332
Bo Mi, Ji Hyo, hide well.

1969
01:16:55,332 --> 01:16:56,833
This is where I was talking about.

1970
01:16:56,967 --> 01:16:58,635
- This podium? - No, this one.

1971
01:16:58,902 --> 01:17:00,203
What's this?

1972
01:17:00,504 --> 01:17:01,905
It's a big stuffed animal.

1973
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:05,375
- It's easy to look past it. - You're right.

1974
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:06,943
- Do you want to hide here? - Yes.

1975
01:17:07,244 --> 01:17:08,645
- Wait a minute. - Can you film?

1976
01:17:08,645 --> 01:17:09,780
- Yes. - Wait.

1977
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:12,115
It doesn't look obvious.

1978
01:17:12,883 --> 01:17:14,117
I'm good.

1979
01:17:15,952 --> 01:17:17,087
I'm good now.

1980
01:17:17,087 --> 01:17:19,189
(She's completely hidden.)

1981
01:17:20,057 --> 01:17:21,124
It's difficult.

1982
01:17:21,124 --> 01:17:23,894
(Where will the other members hide?)

1983
01:17:23,894 --> 01:17:24,995
- Is anyone in here? - Min Yong.

1984
01:17:24,995 --> 01:17:27,731
- Can you go inside? - Let me try it.

1985
01:17:27,731 --> 01:17:29,433
- Just go in there. - I know.

1986
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,401
Gosh.

1987
01:17:31,401 --> 01:17:33,336
(He struggles to fit inside.)

1988
01:17:33,937 --> 01:17:36,373
(Seok Jin hides carefully as he has two items.)

1989
01:17:36,373 --> 01:17:37,407
Give that to me.

1990
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,709
- The camera? - Give me that.

1991
01:17:39,709 --> 01:17:41,678
- Which one? - That one.

1992
01:17:41,678 --> 01:17:42,712
I'll hide here.

1993
01:17:42,712 --> 01:17:45,015
(Where did Jae Seok choose?)

1994
01:17:45,015 --> 01:17:46,049
I'll hide here.

1995
01:17:46,817 --> 01:17:49,252
I'll hide right here.

1996
01:17:49,453 --> 01:17:53,323
(He enters the claw crane.)

1997
01:17:53,323 --> 01:17:56,760
(Where will Bo Mi decide to hide?)

1998
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:57,828
Where should I hide?

1999
01:17:58,929 --> 01:18:00,964
Can I hide inside?

2000
01:18:01,064 --> 01:18:02,065
Thank you.

2001
01:18:02,232 --> 01:18:03,867
May I hide behind the trash can?

2002
01:18:05,035 --> 01:18:06,536
Was Haha here?

2003
01:18:06,536 --> 01:18:07,537
(He hid there.)

2004
01:18:07,537 --> 01:18:08,605
Did he hide here?

2005
01:18:08,872 --> 01:18:10,040
(He hid there before.)

2006
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:12,409
Really? He'll definitely find me here.

2007
01:18:12,809 --> 01:18:13,910
Wait.

2008
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:15,479
This is where he was.

2009
01:18:16,179 --> 01:18:17,214
My goodness.

2010
01:18:18,849 --> 01:18:20,717
Can you switch your uniform with me?

2011
01:18:20,717 --> 01:18:22,419
- Me? - I'm really sorry. It's just once.

2012
01:18:23,019 --> 01:18:27,057
(She pretends like she's a barista.)

2013
01:18:27,257 --> 01:18:31,895
(She changes her clothes instead of hiding.)

2014
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:35,031
May I borrow your glasses?

2015
01:18:35,031 --> 01:18:37,868
I'm really sorry. Thank you.

2016
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:39,402
It's okay.

2017
01:18:39,402 --> 01:18:40,737
(She's meticulous.)

2018
01:18:42,739 --> 01:18:45,408
(Find me if you can.)

2019
01:18:45,542 --> 01:18:47,144
Where was that spot?

2020
01:18:47,811 --> 01:18:49,546
Is there nowhere for me to hide?

2021
01:18:49,546 --> 01:18:51,915
(Min Yong hesitates until the end.)

2022
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,984
You have 10 seconds.

2023
01:18:54,017 --> 01:18:56,820
I'll just stand naturally.

2024
01:18:58,088 --> 01:18:59,489
I'll greet them naturally.

2025
01:18:59,756 --> 01:19:03,360
(They're done hiding.)

2026
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,995
- In 4, - There's nowhere to hide.

2027
01:19:04,995 --> 01:19:07,764
- Right? - 3, 2,

2028
01:19:12,269 --> 01:19:14,271
(They have to collect all 7 items in 5 minutes.)

2029
01:19:14,271 --> 01:19:16,039
- This is first floor, right? - Yes.

2030
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:21,211
(Where could they be?)

2031
01:19:21,311 --> 01:19:25,515
(Make sure you hide well. Your hair might get ripped off.)

2032
01:19:27,918 --> 01:19:32,522
(Does Kwang Soo head straight for the bathroom?)

2033
01:19:32,722 --> 01:19:37,794
(Would he greet him naturally?)

2034
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:42,766
(Seok Jin is hiding in here.)

2035
01:19:42,766 --> 01:19:43,833
Give me that.

2036
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:46,036
- This? - Yes.

2037
01:19:46,036 --> 01:19:48,238
(Seok Jin is hiding in here.)

2038
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:50,140
(How did Kwang Soo know right away?)

2039
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:51,341
Okay.

2040
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:53,710
I was going to hide here but decided not to.

2041
01:19:54,411 --> 01:19:56,446
- Check it out. - Should I?

2042
01:19:56,446 --> 01:19:58,048
(Team Jong Kook was hiding 15 minutes ago.)

2043
01:19:58,048 --> 01:19:59,449
I can go in here.

2044
01:19:59,449 --> 01:20:00,483
(They already found this spot.)

2045
01:20:00,483 --> 01:20:02,085
This is good.

2046
01:20:02,252 --> 01:20:04,221
I was going to hide here but decided not to.

2047
01:20:04,854 --> 01:20:06,323
This is tall.

2048
01:20:07,490 --> 01:20:09,926
(I shouldn't have done that.)

2049
01:20:11,061 --> 01:20:12,262
There must be...

2050
01:20:12,796 --> 01:20:13,897
There's somebody here.

2051
01:20:15,398 --> 01:20:19,135
(Did he get caught?)

2052
01:20:19,135 --> 01:20:20,503
Seok Jin!

2053
01:20:20,704 --> 01:20:23,440
Seok Jin! I found him.

2054
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,909
- Seok Jin. - How did you know?

2055
01:20:26,109 --> 01:20:27,644
I don't have to rip his name tag, right?

2056
01:20:28,078 --> 01:20:29,079
My goodness.

2057
01:20:29,079 --> 01:20:30,080
How did you know?

2058
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,681
I was going to hide here earlier but decided not to.

2059
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:34,818
I guess it looked different before.

2060
01:20:34,818 --> 01:20:36,553
Chocolate and rice.

2061
01:20:36,553 --> 01:20:38,321
Why did he give it to me?

2062
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:44,694
(Kwang Soo turns around.)

2063
01:20:44,694 --> 01:20:50,267
(Did Min Yong get caught?)

2064
01:20:50,267 --> 01:20:53,003
(Dashing)

2065
01:20:53,003 --> 01:20:55,739
(That radio booth looks fishy.)

2066
01:20:56,706 --> 01:21:00,110
(Why won't he come here?)

2067
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:03,980
(This is too intense.)

2068
01:21:04,748 --> 01:21:07,217
(3 minutes 30 seconds left until this round is over.)

2069
01:21:08,351 --> 01:21:12,022
(The coffee shop looks fishy.)

2070
01:21:12,022 --> 01:21:17,827
(Would someone be in Haha's hiding place?)

2071
01:21:25,035 --> 01:21:31,207
(She looks somewhat like Bo Mi but maybe not.)

2072
01:21:31,207 --> 01:21:32,309
- Bo Mi? - Yes.

2073
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:34,944
(Peekaboo)

2074
01:21:34,944 --> 01:21:37,080
Let's go, Bo Mi.

2075
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,515
This wasn't supposed to be it.

2076
01:21:39,282 --> 01:21:41,851
Get changed, Bo Mi.

2077
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:44,321
I got caught right away.

2078
01:21:44,621 --> 01:21:47,724
(Team Jae Seok has 2 items left.)

2079
01:21:47,724 --> 01:21:49,392
Who's here?

2080
01:21:49,893 --> 01:21:51,661
How do you go inside the claw crane?

2081
01:21:51,661 --> 01:21:53,596
(Jong Kook heads towards the claw crane.)

2082
01:21:53,596 --> 01:21:55,632
(Is his intuition right?)

2083
01:21:55,632 --> 01:21:57,300
How do you go inside the claw crane?

2084
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:58,335
(My goodness)

2085
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:01,938
How do you go inside the claw crane?

2086
01:22:01,938 --> 01:22:06,209
(Someone is probably hiding in here.)

2087
01:22:06,209 --> 01:22:07,944
(Banging)

2088
01:22:07,944 --> 01:22:09,112
How do you open this?

2089
01:22:09,512 --> 01:22:11,981
(The situation is imminent.)

2090
01:22:11,981 --> 01:22:13,216
How do you get in?

2091
01:22:14,184 --> 01:22:18,555
(What would happen to Jae Seok?)

2092
01:22:18,555 --> 01:22:19,823
Like this?

2093
01:22:20,423 --> 01:22:21,591
Here he is.

2094
01:22:22,092 --> 01:22:23,226
(Here he is.)

2095
01:22:23,226 --> 01:22:24,861
(He gets caught right away.)

2096
01:22:24,861 --> 01:22:26,363
- My gosh. - Hurry up.

2097
01:22:26,363 --> 01:22:27,464
Come out.

2098
01:22:27,464 --> 01:22:28,698
My gosh.

2099
01:22:28,698 --> 01:22:30,500
- Why? - Come out.

2100
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,202
What's wrong with you?

2101
01:22:32,202 --> 01:22:33,336
(He doesn't have anything.)

2102
01:22:33,436 --> 01:22:35,638
He doesn't have anything.

2103
01:22:35,638 --> 01:22:37,907
Did you get caught? I did too.

2104
01:22:39,109 --> 01:22:40,610
I had a great hiding spot.

2105
01:22:40,610 --> 01:22:43,279
(Min Yong and Ji Hyo are still hiding.)

2106
01:22:43,913 --> 01:22:46,416
Who's still missing?

2107
01:22:46,483 --> 01:22:51,221
(There's 1 minute and 30 seconds left.)

2108
01:22:51,221 --> 01:22:52,689
They're nowhere.

2109
01:22:53,456 --> 01:22:54,657
Let's see.

2110
01:22:54,657 --> 01:22:56,126
We only need one chance.

2111
01:22:56,126 --> 01:22:57,660
That's all we need.

2112
01:22:57,660 --> 01:22:59,129
This won't open.

2113
01:22:59,129 --> 01:23:00,630
It won't open.

2114
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:02,565
I found Jae Seok in the claw crane.

2115
01:23:03,466 --> 01:23:06,536
(He's right by Ji Hyo's hiding place.)

2116
01:23:07,137 --> 01:23:09,839
(Shuddering)

2117
01:23:10,874 --> 01:23:12,442
(Does he have a hunch?)

2118
01:23:12,442 --> 01:23:13,743
Who's missing?

2119
01:23:14,210 --> 01:23:15,178
(Kicking)

2120
01:23:15,645 --> 01:23:18,615
(That was a big impact.)

2121
01:23:19,416 --> 01:23:22,018
(Is this a giant doll?)

2122
01:23:22,018 --> 01:23:23,453
There's someone in here.

2123
01:23:23,787 --> 01:23:24,821
It's here.

2124
01:23:25,155 --> 01:23:26,656
Who's this?

2125
01:23:26,656 --> 01:23:28,124
There's someone in here.

2126
01:23:28,425 --> 01:23:31,294
It's here. Who's this?

2127
01:23:31,294 --> 01:23:32,362
(Ji Hyo stays quiet and doesn't move.)

2128
01:23:32,362 --> 01:23:34,397
Hold on. Isn't this it?

2129
01:23:34,397 --> 01:23:36,566
It must be a person. She has long hair. It's Ji Hyo.

2130
01:23:36,566 --> 01:23:38,735
Ji Hyo. Ji Hyo?

2131
01:23:39,569 --> 01:23:40,603
Ji Hyo?

2132
01:23:41,337 --> 01:23:43,106
Come out, Ji Hyo.

2133
01:23:43,239 --> 01:23:45,208
Ji Hyo.

2134
01:23:45,708 --> 01:23:46,910
She's out.

2135
01:23:47,377 --> 01:23:48,711
Who's left now?

2136
01:23:48,812 --> 01:23:50,547
- Whom did you find? - Ji Hyo.

2137
01:23:50,547 --> 01:23:51,815
- You found her? - Yes.

2138
01:23:51,915 --> 01:23:53,249
How much time do they have?

2139
01:23:53,249 --> 01:23:54,851
We're missing Min Yong.

2140
01:23:55,351 --> 01:23:56,686
It's just him?

2141
01:23:57,387 --> 01:23:59,556
It's just you! Hold on!

2142
01:24:03,626 --> 01:24:06,596
Why are you standing like this? You should have done this earlier.

2143
01:24:08,164 --> 01:24:12,735
(They don't think he's in an obvious spot like the bathroom.)

2144
01:24:12,735 --> 01:24:15,038
It's long.

2145
01:24:15,038 --> 01:24:16,039
It's eerie.

2146
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:18,908
What about the bathroom?

2147
01:24:18,908 --> 01:24:22,245
(He heads to the bathroom.)

2148
01:24:22,378 --> 01:24:25,782
(There's only 10 seconds left. What would happen?)

2149
01:24:25,782 --> 01:24:27,283
What about the bathroom?

2150
01:24:27,317 --> 01:24:29,886
(There's only 10 seconds left. What would happen?)

2151
01:24:29,919 --> 01:24:35,758
(He looks at the mirror by the door.)

2152
01:24:36,025 --> 01:24:38,261
It's just you! Hold on!

2153
01:24:38,261 --> 01:24:41,164
(Just a little bit more, Min Yong.)

2154
01:24:41,798 --> 01:24:43,066
He scared me.

2155
01:24:43,066 --> 01:24:45,802
(He finds Min Yong with a few seconds left.)

2156
01:24:45,902 --> 01:24:48,371
He scared me.

2157
01:24:48,638 --> 01:24:49,939
He scared me.

2158
01:24:49,939 --> 01:24:51,007
Why did you scare me?

2159
01:24:51,007 --> 01:24:52,408
You scared me.

2160
01:24:52,408 --> 01:24:54,110
- Did he get caught? - He got caught.

2161
01:24:54,110 --> 01:24:55,745
- He got caught. - Did you find him?

2162
01:24:56,312 --> 01:24:58,147
Everybody got caught. It's over.

2163
01:24:58,214 --> 01:25:00,450
- Really? - I found Min Yong.

2164
01:25:00,817 --> 01:25:03,553
(Team Jae Seok is out.)

2165
01:25:03,553 --> 01:25:05,855
Today's winning team...

2166
01:25:05,855 --> 01:25:07,524
is Team Jong Kook.

2167
01:25:07,524 --> 01:25:10,894
(Team Jong Kook is the winner of Running Man's Food Guide.)

2168
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:12,495
- That was close. - Bo Mi.

2169
01:25:12,495 --> 01:25:14,297
- We have you in our hearts. - That was close.

2170
01:25:14,497 --> 01:25:16,566
- We consider you one of us. - That's right.

2171
01:25:16,566 --> 01:25:18,434
The secret to...

2172
01:25:18,434 --> 01:25:20,236
Running Man's Food Guide...

2173
01:25:20,503 --> 01:25:22,839
had to do with food that might disappear.

2174
01:25:22,839 --> 01:25:25,241
(It had to do with food that might disappear.)

2175
01:25:25,508 --> 01:25:26,809
- What? - Why?

2176
01:25:28,478 --> 01:25:30,880
The Daily Mirror, a British national tabloid newspaper,

2177
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,583
announced eight food items that'll go extinct due to climate change.

2178
01:25:33,583 --> 01:25:35,618
- No way. - Seven of them are...

2179
01:25:35,618 --> 01:25:37,253
- in front of you. - No way.

2180
01:25:37,253 --> 01:25:38,555
We can't live without rice.

2181
01:25:38,555 --> 01:25:40,390
- Chocolate will disappear? - Peanuts too?

2182
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:41,758
- Barely too? - Coffee.

2183
01:25:41,758 --> 01:25:45,128
You must be interested and invested...

2184
01:25:45,128 --> 01:25:47,664
in order to enjoy these items for a longer time.

2185
01:25:47,797 --> 01:25:50,967
Team Jong Kook won today's race,

2186
01:25:51,167 --> 01:25:52,969
so they get...

2187
01:25:52,969 --> 01:25:55,939
these seven items as a prize.

2188
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,942
- That's so meaningful. - I agree.

2189
01:25:58,942 --> 01:26:01,544
Can Min Yong and Bo Mi...

2190
01:26:01,544 --> 01:26:03,146
say something?

2191
01:26:03,146 --> 01:26:04,447
- Something simple? - Yes.

2192
01:26:04,447 --> 01:26:06,149
I feel bad.

2193
01:26:06,249 --> 01:26:08,518
I was happy to have met Bo Mi.

2194
01:26:09,319 --> 01:26:11,487
What about you, Bo Mi?

2195
01:26:11,487 --> 01:26:12,555
I had so much fun...

2196
01:26:12,555 --> 01:26:15,959
and I realized the importance of positive energy.

2197
01:26:15,959 --> 01:26:17,226
- Really? - I'll come back...

2198
01:26:17,226 --> 01:26:19,629
- when I'm skinnier. - You're pretty already.

2199
01:26:19,629 --> 01:26:21,264
- Stop it. - Please stop.

2200
01:26:21,431 --> 01:26:23,733
- You're already pretty. - Please, Bo Mi.

2201
01:26:23,833 --> 01:26:26,469
We'll be back next week. Thank you.

2202
01:26:26,469 --> 01:26:27,770
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2203
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:31,441
(Thank you Min Yong and Bo Mi for joining us.)

2204
01:26:32,208 --> 01:26:35,812
Today is Booking King Race.

2205
01:26:36,012 --> 01:26:37,180
Booking?

2206
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,548
(We have invited booking kings for today's race.)

2207
01:26:38,548 --> 01:26:39,882
He's so sexy.

2208
01:26:39,882 --> 01:26:41,751
- Would you like to join me? - Of course.

2209
01:26:41,751 --> 01:26:44,554
Who booked for me?

2210
01:26:44,554 --> 01:26:46,055
(They must become booking kings of this territory.)

2211
01:26:46,055 --> 01:26:47,624
- What is the booker's name? - Sandara Park.

2212
01:26:48,758 --> 01:26:50,093
(And)

2213
01:26:50,627 --> 01:26:52,629
(A man with another goal.)

2214
01:26:52,629 --> 01:26:54,030
- Keep going. - Go.

2215
01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:55,832
- Does this make any sense? - What was that?

2216
01:26:55,832 --> 01:26:57,066
He's there.

2217
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:58,334
Hey.

2218
01:26:58,334 --> 01:27:00,737
- Jae Seok is acting by himself. - I wonder what the mission is.
