(a cutthroat war of Tour Stickers breaks out.)

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,900
(In the midst of this brutal war, Se Chan takes the lead.)

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,170
- Se Chan will get the Tour Sticker. - Se Chan, you are in the lead.

21

- By the way, So Min. - Yes?

22
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,270
Did you mean any of it or were you just saying it?

23
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,270
For example, before you threw the dice,

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,910
you said you could throw the number you want just by saying it.

25
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,540
(A while ago when she rolled the die for the first time...)

26
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,300
- She said she has a special power. - What is it?

27
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,670
If she picks a number,

28
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,100
- she can get that number. - Then So Min,

29
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,870
- why don't you pick a number? - Choose one.

30
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,640
- I will pick number 5. - Number 5?

31
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,340
- She called it out. - She really said it.

32
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,340
(The result was...)

33
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,540
(4, not 5.)

34
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,540
(Gosh, that was so close.)

35
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,270
I meant it.

36
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,970
- You did? - Yes.

37
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,500
- You really must be crazy. - No.

38
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,670
(He respects the crazy girl.)

39
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,500
Look. 5 and 4 were very close.

40
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,870
If I could've put more energy into it, I could've gotten it.

41
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,800
(She really believes in her power.)

42
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,940
- I have a special power too. - What is it?

43
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,800
- Everyone has their own power. - Okay.

44
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,070
We are the only ones who are aware of this.

45
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,140
I can turn back time.

46
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,840

47
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,570
I have a death note.

48
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,810
You are talking rubbish. I have one too.

49
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,810
(You have it too?)

50
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,870
- What? - I have one at home.

51
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,670
- Do you really have one? - I really do have it.

52
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,840
- Mine really exists. - Really? Please tell us more.

53
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,900
There are a lot. I used to write on that notebook since primary school.

54
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,810
- Are you serious? - How do you write on that notebook?

55
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,700
- You've been writing for 20 years? - Yes.

56
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,570
I write down the name, date of birth, and blood type.

57
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,000
I also write down when and what happened.

58
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,000
(He gets goosebumps.)

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,040
I am serious.

60
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,170
(She is truly crazy.)

61
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,270
- Of course. - Three.

62
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,270
We need 5 or 6. We don't need anything else.

63
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,800
- Where? What do you want? - I want...

64
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,270
- to go to the Philippines. - How about you?

65
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,770
I want Greece. I want to go there quickly.

66
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,470
Let's aim for Greece and Sweden. All right.

67
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,940
Greece! Here we go.

68
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,570
(Their target is either Greece or Sweden.)

69
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,870
Please be 5 or 6. Be 5 or 6.

70
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,970
(The result is...)

71
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,340
- It's 5! - It's 5!

72
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,870
(They get Greece.)

73
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,000
- Jae Seok! - We are off to a good start.

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,040
- We will go to Greece. - It's Greece.

75
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,700
Please give us the board.

76
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,200
- What are some Greek dishes? - Hey, there's one with olive oil...

77
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,470
- What about Greek yogurt? - Right, Greek yogurt.

78
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,900
- We can search them online. - Let's search and go.

79
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,270
- Jae Seok, there's one in Hongdae. - What is it?

80
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,070
There's a Greek and Turkish restaurant at Hapjeong Station.

81
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,970
But people don't usually look up Greek dishes and try them.

82
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,640
Now that I think of it, I've never had Greek food before.

83
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,740
"Moussaka".

84
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,940
- What is moussaka? - What is that?

85
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,200
It's a Greek eggplant dish with ground beef...

86
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,540
- in bechamel sauce. - Eggplant?

87
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,970
(Hesitant)

88
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,200
- Eggplant? - Well... Eggplant?

89
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,070
- Eggplant... - It sounded unappealing with that.

90
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,200
- I was taken aback with that too. - I liked the ground beef part.

91
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,340
- And... - Are there other dishes?

92
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,940
- Tzatziki. - Tzatziki?

93
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,900
It's mixed with yogurt, cucumber, and garlic.

94
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,070
It's a traditional Greek dish.

95
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,940
- Cucumber and garlic? - It can be an appetizer or sauce.

96
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,440
- Cucumber and garlic? - There are a lot of dishes.

97
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,170
We can order three dishes from Athens.

98
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,740
Let's order a course meal.

99
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,170
- Hello, sir. - Hello.

100
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,800
- Hi, this is all very sudden. - Yes, it is.

101
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,970
We happened to come to a Greek restaurant.

102
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,940
- Can we film while we eat? - Thank you.

103
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,570
- Sure. Have a meal too. - Thank you.

104
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,570
- We're here to taste Greek food. - You are?

105
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,740
Winning is important, but we should enjoy our meal.

106
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,440
- That's my point too. - Give me the menu. I'll order.

107
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,970
Is the water from Greece?

108
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,900
No way. Can it be from Athens?

109
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,870
You didn't bring this water from Athens?

110
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,440
- No, we didn't. - I see.

111
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,370
I thought this could be from there.

112
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,170
- Gosh, it's expensive. - Why? How much is it?

113
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,740
- "Lamb steak"... - Do you want to try moussaka?

114
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,970
Gosh, it's 14 dollars.

115
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,840
(The member with the least amount of money will get the Tour Sticker.)

116
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,800
- Sir. - What is souvlaki?

117
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,110
Souvlaki in Greek means "skewer".

118
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,500
I see. It means flower?

119
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,340
(Gosh, people from the Mediterranean country sure are romantic.)

120
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,900
- It means flower? - No, it means skewer.

121
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,470
- It's skewer. - Oh, it means "skewer".

122
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,870
- It's like a chicken skewer. - I thought it meant flower.

123
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,540
- Please give me one. - You'd like this one.

124
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,700
- Chicken souvlaki and spaghetti. - And this one too.

125
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,570
- All right. - Thank you.

126
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,700
But now, I'm curious to taste them.

127
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,440
We never had sea bream spaghetti.

128
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,500
I've never had it before.

129
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,540
If we need more, let's order some more.

130
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,570
Let's see first.

131
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,940
(Souvlaki is being grilled nicely.)

132
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,070
We will see.

133
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,740
(This Greek-style sea bream pasta has a unique flavor.)

134
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,370
- The food is here. - It's here.

135
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,370
- Gosh, they look so delicious. - This is amazing.

136
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,970
Here are your souvlaki and gyros.

137
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,840
- What is this? - This is the souvlaki.

138
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,070
Take the meat out from the skewer, dip it in the sauce,

139
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,040
- and eat it with the bread. - This is my first time trying this.

140
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,700
- First of all... - This is my first Greek dish.

141
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,140
- I should dip it in the sauce... - And the bread...

142
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,070
- and make a wrap with the bread. - Eat it with the bread.

143
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,040
- This smells good. - Jae Seok.

144
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,570
- Is it like yogurt? - It tastes similar to it.

145
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,700
(She takes a bite.)

146
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,440
The sauce tastes like yogurt.

147
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,470
Souvlaki tastes so good.

148
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,640
- What is this? - That's sea bream pasta.

149
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,700
- Gosh. - This looks great too.

150
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,070
- Is this sea bream? - Yes.

151
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,940
Are the pasta noodles made of squid ink?

152
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,800
- Don't you think? - Are they buckwheat noodles?

153
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,070
Do Greeks cook with buckwheat noodles?

154
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,170
(It looks similar.)

155
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,170
- At least I made sense. - Se Chan.

156
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,000
- Did I go too far? - You went too far.

157
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,370
This is a bit sour too.

158
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,840
(The pasta noodles are delicious.)

159
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,470
- This is a bit sour. - Doesn't it taste unique?

160
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,570
Excuse me. I think the pasta noodles are more slippery...

161
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,440
- than the noodles we usually eat. - The pasta noodles are slippery.

162
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,370
It's because we put in a lot of extra virgin olive oil.

163
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,170
I see. Extra... That oil is quite tasty.

164
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,100
It would have been more delicious for my taste if you put in more.

165
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,170
- More what? - Extra...

166
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,340
That oil is nice. I see. That's what he put in this dish.

167
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,840
No wonder it's slippery.

168
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,270
Se Chan.

169
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,740
(I don't know what it is, but I do know.)

170
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,100
- What? - Yang Se Chan.

171
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,400
I went too far.

172
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,900
(In an instant, they are done eating Greek food.)

173
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,670
- This was a nice meal. - It was delicious.

174
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,870
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

175
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,800
- I'm glad. - We really enjoyed the food.

176
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,440
(Team Ji Hyo acquires Greece.)

177
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,740
- Hyorin, eat as much as you want. - Yes?

178
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,900
- Can I eat as much as I want? - Yes, eat.

179
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,370
Of course. Do you know what kind of a man is the easiest to pick up?

180
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,370
What kind?

181
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,200
- Why? - He's the easiest.

182
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,470
- Why? - I am kind of...

183
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,070
- I always say this. - He's really easy.

184
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,170
Say that I wasn't interested in this girl,

185
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,740
but if she says she's interested in me,

186
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,870
I become interested in her too.

187
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,700
(His heart easily pounds.)

188
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,470
- I'm sort of like that. - But that's everyone.

189
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,870
- No, men like to make a move first. - We are similar in that sense.

190
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,940
I don't like someone first.

191
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,000
- When someone likes you first... - Someone has to...

192
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,740
like me first for me to like him back.

193
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,340
That's how I figure out if someone likes me. If not,

194
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,070
- I don't pay attention to him. - They are so similar.

195
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,840
What do you want to drink?

196
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,640
- I heard Thai milk iced tea's good. - Okay.

197
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,140
- Isn't that expensive though? - But I want soda.

198
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,300
What do you want to eat? Choose one.

199
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,740
(Both Hyorin and Jong Kook get Coca Cola.)

200
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,400
How are they so similar?

201
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,840
Jong Kook really likes Coke.

202
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,500
I am getting Diet Coke.

203
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,170
- Are you getting plain Coke? - Really? Diet Coke...

204
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,700
contains more sugar.

205
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,240
I like the taste. Coke tastes too sweet.

206
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,340
- Isn't Diet Coke sweeter? - No, it isn't.

207
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,940
(He feels nervous.)

208
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,640
You have such similar tastes in food and other things...

209
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,210
that you look like you grew up in the same place.

210
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,300
Seriously. Are you from the same town?

211
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,270
I am from Anyang while she is from Incheon.

212
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,710
I know.

213
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,640
(It's fun mealtime among colleagues.)

214
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,600
It will be really hard for you...

215
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,240
to become a couple.

216
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,570
(They are good colleagues.)

217
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,270
(Team Hyorin acquires Thailand.)

218
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,340
We have to pay 20 dollars?

219
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,710
(Team So Min pays 20 dollars to pass through Thailand.)

220
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,710
Do we have to pay?

221
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,370
- Let's play rock, paper, scissors. - Let us.

222
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,100
We decide who pays 10, 7, or 3 dollars.

223
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,300
- Okay? - Sure.

224
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,140
- First place pays three dollars. - Okay.

225
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,400
Rock, paper, scissors.

226
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,470
- Yes! - This is insane.

227
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,070
What is going on with you today?

228
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,370
- Yes! - This is insane.

229
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,400
(Why is he so lucky today?)

230
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,070
Haha.

231
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,600
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

232
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,800
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

233
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,970
(So Min will pay seven dollars.)

234
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,640
- 7 dollars. - Haha, 10 dollars.

235
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,740
It's a relief.

236
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,040
So Min wrote 50 cents.

237
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,140
How can you call yourself human?

238
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,340
(They betrayed each other from the start.)

239
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,900
Kwang Soo wrote...

240
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,470
- 50 cents. - For goodness' sake. Let's stop.

241
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,710
(Kwang Soo and So Min were like twins.)

242
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,070
Did you give me 50 cents?

243
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,300
(I should have realized back then.)

244
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,870
(Between these traitors...)

245
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,340
You are very thorough.

246
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,100
You are very thorough.

247
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,100
(I will only be a victim.)

248
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,640
- Haha, 10 dollars. - It's a relief.

249
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,140
I think you will go to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.

250
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,270
(What will be the fate of Haha, the king of tricks?)

251
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,070
Wait a minute.

252
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,670
So Min has talent.

253
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,100
When she rolls the die or does other things,

254
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,300
what she shouts out loud comes true.

255
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,500
She is serious.

256
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,170
She told us that in the car.

257
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,940
- 1. - 1.

258
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,710
(So Min chooses 1.)

259
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,140
(Will she get one as she has predicted?)

260
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,440
What she shouts out loud comes true.

261
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,970
- We are desperate. - One.

262
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,270
One.

263
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,470
- I will count it on the floor. - Okay.

264
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,240
(She gets 6.)

265
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,570
Perhaps, she wasn't desperate enough.

266
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,940
She didn't say, "Challenge!"

267
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,070
- She didn't say, "Challenge!" - Say, "Challenge!"

268
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,240
Move out of the way.

269
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,710
(Don't go near the die.)

270
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,300
Should I go away?

271
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,300
- Switzerland. - Switzerland.

272
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,170
Hurry up and spin the wheel.

273
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,270
I will give it a go.

274
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,400
(What will be Team So Min's mission regarding Switzerland?)

275
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,040
(Please let it be something easy that involves eating food.)

276
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,700
(Please let it be something like eating Swiss dishes.)

277
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,970
- This is bad. - Buy a "Made in Switzerland".

278
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,600
(They need to buy a Swiss product.)

279
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,900
Buy a "Made in Switzerland".

280
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,570
This is bad. What should we get?

281
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,740
This is a disaster.

282
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,200
I have never seen anything that was made there.

283
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,140
Wait a minute. Gosh, I am so annoyed.

284
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,140
I have never seen anything that was made there.

285
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,470
Who spun the wheel?

286
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,500
Please let me get one.

287
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,340
- Please let me get one. - Please.

288
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,700
Please give me one.

289
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,800
- Please give me 1. - 1.

290
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,900
(Team Ji Hyo will win if they occupy Sweden.)

291
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,600
(Will the spirit of die answer?)

292
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,370
- That's good. - We got a Golden Key.

293
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,870
(They advance two spaces and acquire a Golden Key.)

294
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,570
- It's not bad. - Golden Key.

295
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,900
Jae Seok, it's okay.

296
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,170
Pick one.

297
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,640
Pick the one that gives you a good feeling.

298
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,670
I picked one.

299
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,740
(They don't know what's written inside.)

300
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,940
Let's take a look.

301
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,200
All right. Please.

302
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,640
Lottery ticket will be nice.

303
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,240
- I'm feeling good. - Me too.

304
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,800
- I'm feeling good. - Me too.

305
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,540
Swapping Card?

306
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,640
(Swapping Card?)

307
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,070
(Why does it have to be Swapping Card?)

308
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,100
Swapping Card?

309
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,640
"Swap countries."

310
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,370
(Swap countries with another team.)

311
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,370
You don't swap places. You only swap countries.

312
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,540
You only swap countries.

313
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,570
Countries?

314
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,640
Shall we swap Greece with Thailand?

315
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,400
That would be the best choice. We need to keep Japan.

316
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,900
We need to go quickly and get the country next to it.

317
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,300
Wouldn't you agree?

318
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,470
I agree.

319
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,170
I agree.

320
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,300
Yes.

321
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,740
I should have picked a better one.

322
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,470
(The sinner lowers his head.)

323
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,740
You know,

324
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,370
I am aware that we have many unlucky members,

325
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,470
but this is too much.

326
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,570
I can't believe I got Swapping Card.

327
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,970
There were a lot of lottery tickets.

328
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,500
- Let's do this. - I will make the swap.

329
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,870
You will swap Greece with Thailand.

330
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,370
(Meanwhile, Team So Min is on the Switzerland mission.)

331
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,870
(Will there be anything at the convenience store?)

332
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,970
This is Belgium?

333
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,400
Czech Republic.

334
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,570
(This isn't it.)

335
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,170
Made in Switzerland?

336
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,570
(That one isn't it either.)

337
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,100
How can we find one?

338
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,900
Switzerland...

339
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,870
(Where are you?)

340
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,870
Hey, hey.

341
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,940
- What products do they have? - Hey, hey.

342
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,340
What is it?

343
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,840
- Switzerland. - Where?

344
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,540
My goodness.

345
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,540
This is unbelievable.

346
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,870
- It's from Switzerland. - It says Switzerland right here.

347
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,300
It's from Switzerland.

348
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,070
(It's a precious item that came from a faraway country.)

349
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,140
(Swiss candy is their savior.)

350
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,670
It's made in Switzerland.

351
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,500
(They complete the mission with a 2-dollar Swiss candy.)

352
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
Let's pray.

353
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,540
Roll the die and move to the next location.

354
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,540
This is interesting.

355
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,800
(To which destination will the dice guide them?)

356
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,270
Wait a minute.

357
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,240
(They get 1.)

358
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,740
- Germany. - We got one.

359
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,370
- We got 1. - 1.

360
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,040
(They move one space from Switzerland.)

361
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,070
(Team So Min will win if they occupy Germany.)

362
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,300
Let's get this country no matter what.

363
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,400
Let's get a food-related mission and eat German food.

364
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,600
Let's buy something that is made in Germany.

365
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,940
In 1, 2, 3.

366
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,040
(Please let it be an easy mission.)

367
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,300
Please. Please.

368
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,640
Let's get a food-related mission and eat German food.

369
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,840
Let's buy something that is made in Germany.

370
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,740
Please. Please.

371
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,970
(Which mission will they get on the wheel?)

372
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,400
(Meet a famous person related to the country.)

373
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,800
(How will they meet a famous person who is related to Germany?)

374
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,270
It's one mission we didn't want.

375
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,940
Seriously.

376
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,700
(Haha is acting strange.)

377
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,900
I don't know if this will work. Wait a minute.

378
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,970
- Whom should we meet? - Wait a minute.

379
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,940
- Whom should we meet? - Come here.

380
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,970
Germany...

381
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,970
It has to be someone famous, right?

382
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,770
- Yes. We must know them. - Someone who is related to Germany.

383
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,970
- All of us must know the person. - That's right.

384
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,540
That person doesn't have to be German.

385
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,300
- Someone who is related to Germany. - I will go...

386
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,840
- and do what we discussed earlier. - Okay.

387
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,570
Order something tasty.

388
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,100
He is leaving to cast the person.

389
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,940
- Go on. - We will part ways.

390
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,370
- I will get going. - Let's meet up later.

391
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,670
(What are they thinking?)

392
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,170
Where can we find him?

393
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,940
How will we find a German in the middle of Itaewon?

394
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,200
Seriously. It's not an easy country.

395
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,970
Hello.

396
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,340
Hello.

397
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,970
(They hear a voice from behind.)

398
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,840
- Hello. - What brings you here?

399
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,070
Hello.

400
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,240
What brings you here?

401
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,470
My goodness.

402
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,870
- What brings you here? - Wait a minute.

403
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,100
- Are you Haha? - Yes, I am. Hello.

404
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,670
- Hello. - Hello.

405
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,440
- You know who he is, right? - Hello.

406
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,300
He is famous in Germany.

407
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,640
Good morning.

408
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,240
He was born in Germany.

409
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,970
- Type his name online. - He was born in Germany.

410
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,970
It says right there that I was born in Germany.

411
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,840
- You completed the mission. - Yes!

412
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,370
(Their plan worked.)

413
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,370
However...

414
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,070
(However...)

415
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,870
About three minutes ago,

416
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,700
Team Jae Seok claimed Switzerland as their own.

417
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,300
(They swapped their country with Switzerland.)

418
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,800
(It happened 3 minutes before they met the famous person.)

419
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,340
We got a Golden Key again. Roll the die again.

420
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,370
We got it again.

421
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,800
I can't believe...

422
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,440
we got another Golden Key.

423
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,900
We always get bad cards.

424
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,940
(What did they pick this time?)

425
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,500
Swapping Card.

426
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,070
That's good. Let's get Switzerland.

427
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:57,170
(They stopped Team So Min from winning.)

428
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,940
Pay 20 dollars for Germany.

429
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,340
- Then we will move... - We have to pay again.

430
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,370
to the next destination.

431
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,600
Let's pay.

432
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,670
Let's play rock, paper, scissors. If you play the same hand, you pay.

433
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,340
- If you don't, you are exempt. - Then you are exempt.

434
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,470
(The person who plays a different hand will be exempt.)

435
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,470
- Okay. - Let's go.

436
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,970
What are you doing?

437
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,040
Nothing.

438
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,500
(What are you guys planning?)

439
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,770
- It's impossible to plan ahead. - Don't lie.

440
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,840
- It's impossible. - I saw you exchange looks.

441
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,570
- It's impossible to plan ahead. - I saw you exchange looks.

442
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,970
Think about it. It's impossible to plan ahead.

443
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,970
- I saw you exchange looks. - We must play different hands.

444
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,470
The one with a different hand wins.

445
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,340
I saw you exchange looks.

446
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,640
You fool, think about it. We can't come up with a plan.

447
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,740
- No. - How will we do that?

448
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,570
I can't believe you.

449
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,970
You are mistaken. I swear.

450
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,370
I saw you formulate a plan with your eyes.

451
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,440
It will be good for you if we play the same hand.

452
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,370
- She has issues. - I swear.

453
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,140
- I swear. - She needs treatment.

454
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,300
The one who plays a different hand will be exempt.

455
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,270
Is it even possible for us to win at this point?

456
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,140
That's not what's important.

457
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,970
- I don't care about the result. - This is a matter of pride.

458
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,670
It's a battle between us.

459
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,840
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

460
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,740
(They play rock, paper, scissors with suspicion.)

461
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,940
- Yes! - This is annoying.

462
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,070
(Kwang Soo is exempt from paying.)

463
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,870
(I am spending a lot of money today.)

464
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,140
This is upsetting.

465
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,800
- Ji Hyo, this is the only way. - 1, 2, 3, 4.

466
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,870
We can swap countries.

467
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,040
- This is our best chance. - We can swap countries.

468
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,640
We can swap these two countries.

469
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,870
- Right. - Then we will be done.

470
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,670
(Get 4 on the die and acquire a Golden Key.)

471
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,100
(Get a Swapping Card.)

472
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,370
(Swap Germany with Thailand to win with Germany and Switzerland.)

473
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,370
It's our only chance.

474
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,410
Please show us four.

475
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,410
- It's our only chance. - Please show us four.

476
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,540
(The die is cast.)

477
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,470
(Will she get a four?)

478
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,040
- What? - Hey.

479
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,740
(She really got a four.)

480
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,570
- Hey. - Did you see that?

481
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,600
- We have it. - Did you see that?

482
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,970
- Ji Hyo, you are insane. - Did you see that?

483
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,340
- You are insane. - You saw that, right?

484
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,970
This is crazy. You are the best.

485
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,300
You are insane.

486
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,170
- Ji Hyo. - It's too early to give up.

487
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,540
What will become of Running Man?

488
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,940
- Let's read the signs. - You are insane.

489
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,500
She should be a fortune teller.

490
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,740
What do the signs say?

491
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,140
You are insane. You are insane.

492
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,240
Give us a Golden Key.

493
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,140
Give us one. Ji Hyo, you are the best.

494
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,340
(They succeed in getting a Golden Key.)

495
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,410
It will be game over if we get Swapping Card.

496
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,240
It will be over right here.

497
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,270
I can't believe Haha used such a cheap trick.

498
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,140
He's not that famous.

499
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,170
He's not that famous.

500
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,200
- He isn't good enough yet. - He has to be famous in Germany.

501
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,600
- It'd be insane if you pick it. - You can be psychic.

502
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,940
The probability is too low.

503
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,300
If you draw a Swapping Card, I'll be very happy.

504
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,440
However, I'll be scared of you after this.

505
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,300
Seriously.

506
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:34,870
It's a 1 out of 14 chance.

507
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,070
This is too difficult.

508
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,240
Please throw the die again.

509
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,600
If we land in Spain, don't we win?

510
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,970
(They win if they purchase Spain.)

511
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,970
We're doomed if we have to find something related to Luxembourg.

512
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:55,070
It's hard to find things related to Iceland or Madagascar.

513
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,940
- Don't land in the South Pole. - We'll be doomed.

514
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,600
My fingers went limp.

515
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,840
- One is the best. - Throw a low number.

516
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,270
(She already threw the die.)

517
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:06,200
(Please let it be one.)

518
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
- Throw a low number. - One is the best.

519
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,500
(She throws a 1.)

520
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,840
- Throw a low number. - One is the best.

521
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,340
(We're proud of you, Hyorin.)

522
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,100
I told you that you'd make it.

523
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,940
- This is turning the tables. - It depends on your will.

524
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,740
- Wait a minute. - This is turning the tables.

525
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,800
(Will they get an easy mission?)

526
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,540
- It's "Cultural Experience". - Is that it?

527
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,910
- It's not bad. - It isn't.

528
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,970
- It's "Cultural Experience". - That's right.

529
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:32,970
Here are the rules.

530
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,970
Siesta is a part of Spanish culture.

531
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,970
Here are the rules for "Cultural Experience".

532
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:42,340
Like siesta in Spain, you must take a nap for 10 minutes.

533
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,640
You must take a nap for 10 minutes.

534
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,370
You fail if you open your eyes before 10 minutes pass.

535
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,970
Really?

536
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,740
- Keep your eyes closed. - Let's keep our eyes closed.

537
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,070
Let's talk with our eyes closed.

538
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,670
- 10 minutes is long. - Don't open them.

539
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,470
Imagine that we're sleeping.

540
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,700
I want to open my eyes.

541
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,170
Can we eliminate 1 by 1?

542
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,200
- You may do that. - Is that okay?

543
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,700
- We'll pick the ones to eliminate. - We have unlucky hands.

544
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,300
- Gosh. - Look at that.

545
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,300
- I pick this one. - Turn it over.

546
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,700
It's desert island.

547
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,270
We increased our chance. We only have 12 cards left.

548
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,470
- Let's keep eliminating them. - We're unlucky after all.

549
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,740
Look at this.

550
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,640
(The unlucky men increase Ji Hyo's chances.)

551
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,300
(He hesitates.)

552
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,470
Turn it over once you touch it.

553
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,500
- Otherwise, she'll be confused. - There we go.

554
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,500
You'll get it, Ji Hyo. Please.

555
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,270
- Ji Hyo. - Please.

556
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,570
It's one of these.

557
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,300
(They need Ji Hyo to be lucky again.)

558
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,940
- We win with a Swapping Card. - We win.

559
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,370
It's game over then.

560
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,700
You'll get it, Ji Hyo. Please.

561
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,770
- Please. - It's one of these.

562
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:53,440
(Team Hyorin sleeps while dreaming of turning the tables.)

563
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,370
(Will they clear the mission first or will she pick Swapping Card?)

564
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,740
Don't look yet.

565
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
(She grabs it.)

566
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,700
Don't look yet.

567
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,670
(Ji Hyo picks a card.)

568
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:09,340
(What does her Golden Key say?)

569
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,740
Look at this!

570
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,970
(She screams in joy.)

571
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,740
Look at this!

572
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,770
(They all scream.)

573
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,800
(Ji Hyo gets lucky again.)

574
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,410
(They successfully draw a Swapping Card.)

575
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,410
- What's the mission? - I don't want to play anymore.

576
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,770
We picked a Swapping Card.

577
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:31,910
(They pick a Swapping Card.)

578
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,100
This is amazing.

579
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,970
You swapped Germany with Thailand.

580
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,170
Yes.

581
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,240
The winner of Running Marble is Team Jae Seok.

582
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,100
(They win Running Marble Part Two.)

583
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,970
(It's a result of great teamwork.)

584
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,970
I'm so happy.

585
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,140
- Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo.

586
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,970
- You made our day, Ji Hyo. - Seriously.

587
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,570
(Team Ji Hyo wins Running Marble.)

588
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,470
It's Running Marble, a backpacking trip in the neighborhood.

589
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,270
The team that came in last must take a Tour Sticker.

590
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:10,700
The one with the least amount of money will take it.

591
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,770
- Please count how much... - Goodness.

592
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,270
you have left.

593
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,870
- I might be the one. - Do you have two?

594
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,970
(Haha started with 50 cents.)

595
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,200
(He was betrayed by So Min and Kwang Soo.)

596
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,500
(As his team members continued to betray him,)

597
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,270
(he had to spend his money little by little.)

598
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,270
(He was doomed from the start to the end.)

599
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,240
I'm in trouble.

600
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,740
I'm hopeless.

601
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,970
(Hyoin, order as much as you want.)

602
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:51,340
(He kept spending his money to win her heart.)

603
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,470
(He had to pay many penalty fees.)

604
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,440
(He may go bankrupt soon.)

605
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,900
I need to count every last penny.

606
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,670
I have 18 dollars.

607
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,270
(Jong Kook's remaining amount)

608
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:06,140
(He has 18 dollars.)

609
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,600
I have 18 dollars and 30 cents.

610
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,140
(Haha needs more than that.)

611
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,600
I have...

612
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,240
- I have 18 dollars. - What?

613
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,140
(Haha also has 18 dollars.)

614
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,440
(Who will lose?)

615
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,200
How could he not know?

616
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,970
- I have three coins. - He has a lot.

617
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,640
- He has 18 dollars and 30 cents. - He has the same amount.

618
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,500
(Does he have the same amount?)

619
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,640
I have a 50-cent coin.

620
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:37,170
(Is one of them a 50-cent coin?)

621
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,170
(He has 70 cents total.)

622
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,500
I have 18 dollars and 70 cents.

623
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,340
- You have the least. - It's 18 dollars and 70 cents.

624
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,440
Put a Tour Sticker on Jong Kook's name.

625
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,800
Jong Kook gets a Tour Sticker.

626
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,770
He finally got it.

627
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,670
(Jong Kook gets a Tour Sticker for this round.)

628
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,770
(As the end of a beautiful spring draws near,)

629
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,100
(what type of mission will the members get?)

630
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,800
Hello, hello.

631
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,700
- Hello. - Hello.

632
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,970
Where's Se Chan?

633
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,700
- Right. Where is he? - Why isn't he here?

634
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,340
- Se Chan isn't here. - Where is he?

635
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,640
I guess he isn't coming.

636
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,100
- Really? Already? - That's true.

637
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,840
- I didn't see him in the car. - What happened to him?

638
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,500
Give him one more chance.

639
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,670
He is... No, he was sweet.

640
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,170
(Where could Se Chan be?)

641
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,270
- May is a familial month. - Yes.

642
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,340
For you to get to know the new members like your own family,

643
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,640
you'll visit Se Chan's house.

644
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,170
Are we visiting his house?

645
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:40,200
Se Chan thinks the shoot is in two hours, and he's getting ready.

646
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,740
That's why he isn't here.

647
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,540
This also happened to Kwang Soo.

648
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,200
- He was brushing his teeth. - I remember that.

649
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,300
(He can't forget how shocked he was.)

650
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,140
This is scary.

651
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,240
We can't visit his house empty-handed.

652
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,370
Right.

653
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,840
Here are the rules...

654
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,140
- for Dangerous Gifts. - What are they?

655
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,270
Each of you must buy an item that he needs,

656
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:08,600
but it must be something that he doesn't have at home.

657
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,200
- Goodness. - A necessary item he doesn't have?

658
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,970
- It's difficult. - Something that he doesn't have?

659
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,440
(It's a dangerous, house-warming party.)

660
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,570
You lose a point if you buy an item he already has.

661
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,270
If all seven members buy an item that he doesn't have,

662
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,500
Se Chan will lose one point.

663
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,440
We're sensitive about clearing each mission...

664
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,300
because a Tour Sticker is the penalty.

665
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,970
- It's a harsh price to pay. - It'll determine our next week.

666
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:35,140
This is how to make it fun. Some should get many Tour Stickers.

667
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,700
(Get many Tour Stickers.)

668
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,370
- One member should get many. - That's impossible.

669
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,870
That would be strange.

670
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,840
- Obvious members got them. - That's true.

671
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,140
Why is there so much more space for this round?

672
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,440
- Why? - That's true.

673
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,140
(There's a lot of space in the chart.)

674
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,770
(Is there a hidden intention?)

675
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,940
(One member is selected for a Dangerous Tour.)

676
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,070
- There must be several stickers. - What's the reason?

677
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,940
There must be 2 or 3.

678
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,200
- There are several today. - That's true.

679
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,540
In that case...

680
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:11,740
After you purchase a gift each, we'll drive to Se Chan's place.

681
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,800
Okay.

682
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,840
What should I buy?

683
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,370
What should I buy?

684
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:20,400
This is very difficult.

685
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,970
- Would he have this? - What?

686
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,700
(She whispers to Ji Hyo.)

687
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,600
Why don't you share your idea with us?

688
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:30,340
Come on, you're so silly.

689
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,070
(She thinks as she walks.)

690
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,500
(So Min, you're the best.)

691
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,970
(What kind of gift will So Min buy?)

692
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,240
Can I buy it?

693
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,040
Will they consider me dirty if I buy it?

694
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:52,040
I know many male friends who use it.

695
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,500
It's over there.

696
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,800
Excuse me.

697
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,570
Yes?

698
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,200
Do you have an enema?

699
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,970
(Did she say enema?)

700
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,070
(Her embarrassment disappears.)

701
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,170
May I just get one?

702
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,970
Just 1? It's 40 cents.

703
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,040
It's very cheap.

704
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,170
Please give me 40 cents.

705
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,900
(She begs for 40 cents from the staff.)

706
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,040
Is this okay to be aired?

707
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,140
(Will you be okay with it?)

708
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,370
Thank you.

709
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,640
I'm so smart.

710
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,470
I think I'm so smart.

711
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,870
(Se Chan won't have this at home.)

712
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,600
Something just hit me and...

713
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,040
It was just a fly.

714
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,600
- What's the idea? - Come on, Jae Seok.

715
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,940
- It was a fly that hit you. - It's not what I meant.

716
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,170
Something came up in my head.

717
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,500
- My goodness. - Kwang Soo.

718
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,200
- I know you were joking. - Think carefully.

719
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,370
How about a lottery ticket?

720
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,500
(A lottery ticket)

721
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,840
(Kwang Soo finally comes up with a brilliant idea.)

722
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,200
Do you still think I lack ideas?

723
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,970
Do you still think...

724
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:03,200
(They fight to buy a lottery ticket first.)

725
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,040
Kwang Soo.

726
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,800
- That's such a great idea. - He won't have it at home.

727
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,940
A lottery ticket is perfect.

728
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,700
Do you sell lottery tickets?

729
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,900
(Are you going to buy it first?)

730
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:19,040
Seriously, not many people have lottery tickets at home.

731
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,700
I want to come up with something really unexpected.

732
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,870
Should I get foot care products?

733
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,770
I saw them earlier.

734
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,170
- Do you have this at home? - Everyone does.

735
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:29,900
- Do you have this? - You do, right?

736
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,770
You don't, right? Do you have one of these?

737
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,100
- No, right? - Something like this.

738
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,100
(Ji Hyo gets something unfamiliar.)

739
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,240
Thank you.

740
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,700
He can't have one of these at home.

741
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,700
If a male celebrity has one of these,

742
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,200
he'd be a super, ultra celebrity.

743
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,840
If he has lottery tickets at home, I'll accept my fate.

744
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,340
(Jae Seok is looking for toys.)

745
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,800
What should I get?

746
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,740
- Kwon Ryeol. - Yes?

747
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,100
We're doomed.

748
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,040
(I'm sorry I've dragged you into this.)

749
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,400
We're doomed.

750
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,740
I can't find toys.

751
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,400
How far are we going?

752
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,500
All I see are restaurants.

753
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,940
Could there be one in Sangam?

754
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,870
Perhaps a robot... He probably doesn't have a hamburger.

755
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,070
I'm sure he definitely doesn't have this.

756
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,470
He can't have diapers. Red beans... Stamps...

757
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,100
He can't have tuna at home, right?

758
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,870
Keys... He might have chocolate.

759
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,100
Candles? Tacks... Leads...

760
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,870
He might have a tape measure.

761
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,700
He might have all these things.

762
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,900
(He's wandering anxiously around Sangam.)

763
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,400
(He's back where he started.)

764
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,700
I could have come here in the beginning.

765
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,870
It's right here.

766
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,500
My goodness.

767
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,300
Hello.

768
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,200
He can't have one of these.

769
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,800
(Jae Seok buys his gift.)

770
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,240
They must be waiting for me.

771
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,970
- Gosh. - What happened?

772
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,570
- What happened? - Where did you go?

773
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,640
- What happened? - What happened?

774
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,240
I wanted to get toys, but I couldn't find a store.

775
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,800
- You spent an hour for this? - Let's go.

776
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,240
- Let's go. - Let's hurry.

777
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,240
All right.

778
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,470
(They visit the unsuspecting man.)

779
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,100
(His neighborhood is filled with the beauty of spring.)

780
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,340
We're here.

781
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,140
- We're here. - Let's go.

782
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,070
(Se Chan, here we come.)

783
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,670
- Well... - He lives in Building 125.

784
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,070
- There's the gate. - Let's go in when it opens.

785
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,500
Se Chan's manager is here.

786
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,100
- Hi. - Hello.

787
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,200
- He knows the passcode. - Does he really have no idea?

788
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,100
- Really? - No, he has no idea.

789
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,200
- Se Chan has no idea. - It's exciting.

790
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,100
Let's be quiet.

791
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,600
(Raid Se Chan's place.)

792
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,140
(Se Hyung is not home.)

793
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,140
- Hey. - Where is his place?

794
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,770
Here?

795
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,040
- He really doesn't know? - No.

796
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,400
He doesn't.

797
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
(They're at his door.)

798
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,400
(When the door opens,)

799
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,300
(we'll barge in.)

800
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,470
(We're all set.)

801
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,870
(Let's go.)

802
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,140
(The manager rings the doorbell.)

803
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,400
He might see you.

804
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,600
(The cameramen are hiding too.)

805
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,100
(The door opens.)

806
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,300
(What is this?)

807
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,040
- What is this? - Look at him.

808
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,070
Let's go in.

809
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,600
(Surprise!)

810
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,440
Oh, my. He's not wearing a shirt.

811
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,040
- Hey! - Let's go in.

812
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,600
- He's not wearing a shirt. - Stay that way.

813
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,100
- Stop it. - Stay topless.

814
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,200
- Stay topless. - No!

815
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,670
- He's not wearing a shirt. - It's okay.

816
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,900
- Se Chan. - Stay that way.

817
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,300
Stop it.

818
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,300
Put the shirt on.

819
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,570
You have a nice place.

820
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,870
What is this? What were you watching?

821
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,470
I wasn't watching it.

822
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,540
What is this?

823
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:44,770
(Lingerie channel?)

824
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,570
Why were you watching it with your shirt off?

825
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,140
- What were you doing? - Why weren't you wearing a shirt?

826
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,270
- What's with you? - Why were you watching that?

827
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,870
- Why were you topless? - What were you doing?

828
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,800
- What is this? - Were you watching this?

829
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,600
- Why are you changing the channel? - You were watching something weird.

830
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,300
- Look at that. - Why did you change the channel?

831
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,600
You should have told me in advance.

832
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,140
Why weren't you wearing a shirt?

833
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,940
- What's so wrong about it? - I mean,

834
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,970
- I was at least wearing pants. - you were expecting your manager.

835
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:12,970
Hey! I was going to put on a shirt. Why didn't you tell me in advance?

836
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,670
He wasn't supposed to tell you.

837
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,170
(Satisfied)

838
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,340
You were at least wearing pants.

839
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,240
- Of course. - My goodness.

840
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,400
What are you eating?

841
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,070
They're chips.

842
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,040
- Feel free to eat anything. - Can we?

843
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,840
- Can we look in your fridge? - Go ahead.

844
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,570
- Feel free. - We showed up unannounced.

845
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:33,500
It's chaos. Se Chan.

846
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,970
We brought all the equipment.

847
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:39,640
- We have to install that. - They're going to install that.

848
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,040
- You have a lovely place. - I'm just renting it.

849
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,770
- Let's sit down. - Take a seat.

850
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:45,870
He has a nice place.

851
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:49,570
Se Chan, thank you for letting us come in.

852
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,800
Letting you come in, my foot. You just barged in.

853
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:57,770
We can't say that he let us come in. He was half-naked.

854
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,870
He didn't let us come in.

855
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,940
Seok Jin, you keep shedding something.

856
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,500
It's from his knees.

857
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,100
- Hey. - It's not only his hair that sheds.

858
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,600
His pants shed too.

859
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,140
(Hesitant)

860
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,670
Is it just me or does someone's feet smell bad?

861
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,840
- Why do you ask Kwang Soo? - It's not me.

862
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,040
Why do you pick on me?

863
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,500
You're the only one who's not wearing socks.

864
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,600
- It's not me. Smell my feet. - It's your feet.

865
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,700
Smell mine.

866
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,040
(I'm innocent.)

867
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,340
- Who is it? - So Min.

868
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,140
- You're not wearing socks. - So Min.

869
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,340
- She's not wearing socks. - You're the only one.

870
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,500
- I think it's him. - No, it's not.

871
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,670
- Gosh. - My feet don't smell.

872
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,300
- Stop it. - My feet don't smell.

873
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,700
Your feet are closest to you.

874
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,500
Gosh, it's you.

875
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,100
- It's really you. - That's not true.

876
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,900
- Smell them. - Stop it.

877
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,470
Stop it.

878
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,770
So Min, I'll write about this in my report on you.

879
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,300
My feet never smell.

880
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,670
Did you touch your nose after touching your feet?

881
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,400
That's why.

882
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,500
(It's from your hands.)

883
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,940
- That's why. - Some people do that.

884
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,340
(She should compete with Do Yeon sometime.)

885
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:07,470
The one with the lowest score...

886
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:10,940
will get a Tour Sticker at the end.

887
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,870
With one more sticker, Se Chan will be sent on the trip.

888
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,810
- He will. - You're almost there.

889
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:19,970
Now, you'll give Se Chan the gifts you've bought.

890
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:24,500
If he already has the same thing at home,

891
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,500
the present-giver will lose one point.

892
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:31,100
If he has none of the things the members got,

893
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,470
he will lose one point.

894
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:36,200
I will? Comedians have all kinds of stuff.

895
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,140
- That's right. - I have all kinds of props.

896
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:42,040
- He might have what I got. - What is it?

897
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,400
- What is it? - I'm serious.

898
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,940
- Is it expensive? - It's...

899
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,400
You definitely have one of these.

900
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,310
- It's a beauty product. - A beauty product?

901
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,940
- It's a pack. - I have packs.

902
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,240
- You do? - Let me see.

903
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,870
- What kind of pack is it? - It's a foot pack.

904
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,670
A foot pack?

905
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,770
(Is there such a thing as a foot pack?)

906
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:00,500
- That's awesome. - Are you serious?

907
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,100
- Is this real life? - Is it?

908
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,540
- Is it? - Is this a foot pack?

909
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,570
This is the least strange thing we have.

910
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:09,100
It removes hardened dead skin cells.

911
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:12,840
Jong Kook is so petty.

912
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,310
A foot pack? Give me a second.

913
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,070
- Do you have one? - See if you have one.

914
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,070
- I mean, - You might have one.

915
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,400
he might have gotten one from his fans.

916
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,870
- That's possible. - Se Hyung might have one.

917
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:29,100
(His fridge is full of packs.)

918
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,310
I've never seen a foot pack before.

919
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,310
I've never seen it before.

920
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,700
I think he might have one.

921
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,840
- What if he has one? - I think he has one.

922
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,100
- No way. - A foot pack...

923
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,100
These are all the packs I have.

924
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,240
I've never gone through all these.

925
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,670
- You have so many. - I'm getting nervous.

926
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,340
(One of them might be a foot pack.)

927
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,770
- He has a lot. - Wait.

928
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,870
- Aren't they all face packs? - Gosh.

929
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:54,770
- This one is for the face. - This one is for the face too.

930
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,200
- I hope I have one. - It's for the face.

931
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,100
- They're usually for the face. - They're all for the face.

932
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,040
How did you think of a foot pack?

933
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,310
(Se Chan is new to foot packs,)

934
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,870
(but his brother, Se Hyung, might be familiar with them.)

935
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,900
- There isn't? - There isn't.

936
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,970
That's a relief.

937
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,970
He has no foot packs.

938
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,700
(Jong Kook succeeds.)

939
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,200
This is a very useful gift.

940
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,100
Can I put it away?

941
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,670
I'm worried I'll use it on my face while drunk.

942
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,470
Don't be absurd.

943
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,140
- It might happen. - That's absurd.

944
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,970
- Seriously. - That's absurd.

945
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:28,310
Let's give the foot pack to So Min.

946
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:30,840
Why are you doing this to me?

947
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,400
Stop wriggling your toes.

948
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,240
Hey, don't blame me.

949
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,040
The smell is not too bad.

950
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,500
- It's not too bad. - I have my socks here.

951
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,600
- Don't take them out. - But they're skin-color.

952
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,770
- Why are you showing them to us? - They're skin-color.

953
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,970
(She takes her socks out.)

954
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,840
I took them off because the color is embarrassing.

955
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,840
Do you touch your face after touching them?

956
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,870
- They don't smell. - So Min.

957
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,900
- Put them back in. - They don't smell.

958
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,700
- What are you doing? - They don't smell.

959
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,940
- Put them in. - Put them in.

960
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,200
- Fine, we get it. - They're clean.

961
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,970
- Fine. - Viewers,

962
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,600
- this is not fair. - Put them in.

963
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,840
(She pleads to the viewers.)

964
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,670
- Put them in. - Gosh.

965
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,200
It's you.

966
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,970
No, it's not.

967
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,310
They don't...

968
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,670
What are you doing?

969
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,040
(Seok Jin is knocked out.)

970
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,970
- Hold on. - Why did you rub your fingers?

971
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,570
- Stop it. - What is she doing?

972
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,810
- It makes the smell worse. - I know.

973
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:29,170
- What did you do? - Why did you do that?

974
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,100
Now, it's Ji Hyo's turn.

975
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,570
I got something both Se Chan and Se Hyung can use.

976
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,870
I got chewable toothbrushes.

977
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,940
- I got chewable toothbrushes. - Do you have it?

978
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,400
What's that?

979
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
That's ridiculous.

980
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,140
(Ji Hyo succeeds.)

981
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,500
You might have something that has the same function.

982
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,040
- He must have one. - What is this?

983
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,310
It's hair removal cream.

984
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,310
- It's for waxing. - It's wax.

985
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,870
Wax?

986
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,170
You don't have it, do you?

987
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,100
Haha succeeded.

988
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,570
What's that?

989
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,600
- It's an enema. - It's an enema.

990
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,100
An enema?

991
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,200
(Why is she giving me this?)

992
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,310
- I don't have this. - That's funny.

993
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,100
- I'm... - Show us your present.

994
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,240
- Mine? - Yes.

995
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:13,840
(What will be his gift?)

996
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,700
- What is that? - All right. I...

997
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,270
got you a double eyelid tape.

998
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,570
- A double eyelid tape? - It's to make double eyelids.

999
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,070
- A double eyelid tape? - Yes.

1000
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,370
If he has this at home...

1001
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:28,140
(Let's see.)

1002
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,170
- Wait a second. - You have it?

1003
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,640
- If you have this at home... - Wait a second.

1004
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,440
But you have double eyelids. Are you trying to double what you have?

1005
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,970
- Do you really have it? - "Wait a second" is funny.

1006
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,170
- He's looking around to find it. - No way.

1007
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:43,070
- He can't have it. - Okay.

1008
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,470
(Will Se Chan really have the tape?)

1009
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,970
There we go.

1010
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,810
- He can't have the tape. - Who uses...

1011
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,270
Who uses tapes anyway?

1012
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,440
- He doesn't have much at home. - He can't find it.

1013
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,870
- Jae Seok, what did you bring? - Yes?

1014
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,540
- Double eyelid tape. - Double eyelid tape.

1015
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,100
I'm not sure if this is the right one.

1016
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:02,370
(If he has it at home, Jae Seok will be the first to fail the mission.)

1017
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,700
I'm not sure if this is the right one.

1018
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,200
- Let me see. - Please check.

1019
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,100
- This is right. - Okay!

1020
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,970
(He indeed had it at home!)

1021
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,770
- My gosh! - Why does he have this at home?

1022
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,470
Why do you have this at home?

1023
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:15,870
- Why... - Hey.

1024
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,640
- It's understandable. - He used almost all of them.

1025
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,600
- Yes! - Why do you have them?

1026
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:25,670
I'm not sure. I was trying to take out what was in my pocket and...

1027
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,040
I think it was there.

1028
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:30,770
- Make yourself clear. - It doesn't make sense.

1029
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,240
- In your pocket? - It was in your pocket?

1030
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,310
- You were mumbling just now. - It doesn't make sense.

1031
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,770
It just happened to be here?

1032
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,670
Why do you have used up tapes at home?

1033
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,870
Tell me. Whose is this?

1034
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,600
- Well... - Be honest.

1035
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,070
- Wait. - Why are you blushing?

1036
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,400
- Tell us this instant. - Whose is this?

1037
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,870
- Why is it here? - Why?

1038
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,370
- If it's hard to say... - Why do you have it?

1039
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,470
My acquaintance...

1040
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,740
- Your acquaintance? Who? - Well, my friend...

1041
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,310
Then did your friend...

1042
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:58,200
sleep over for... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days?

1043
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,840
(Is this a dormitory or something?)

1044
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,670
- Your friend stayed for five days. - I mean...

1045
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:04,740
- My eyelids aren't the same. - They don't have the same shape.

1046
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:08,400
- Don't you lie. - That can't be the reason.

1047
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,500
- Do it yourself then. - Right. Do it.

1048
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,970
- Let him do it himself. - Let's see if you're used to this.

1049
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,810
- Don't help him out. - Do it.

1050
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,600
Girls would notice right away.

1051
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,970
Sorry, but are you a detective?

1052
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,540
- Are you from the police? - I'm a sheriff.

1053
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,340
He's a Mapo sheriff.

1054
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,700
- He's investigating now. - Let's see.

1055
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,870
- If you're not good at it... - Do it.

1056
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,670
- You have to do it at once. - How can he have this at home?

1057
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,670
- He's good. - He's actually doing it.

1058
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,200
- He's good at it. - He's really doing it.

1059
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,870
- It looks natural. - He's right.

1060
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,310
- He's good at it. - He's right.

1061
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,200
- It's his. - This side of my eyelid...

1062
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,810
- All right. I admit. - Okay.

1063
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:41,100
(They're still suspicious, but they admit that it's Se Chan's.)

1064
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,440
- It's Seok Jin's turn. - All right.

1065
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,740
- He can't have this at home. - Se Chan has...

1066
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,570
- unusual things at home. - I'm sure of this.

1067
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:53,240
(Seok Jin even confirmed it to the staff before buying.)

1068
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,840
(It's deodorant.)

1069
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,440
I won't say a word if you have it.

1070
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,070
You won't say a word? All right. Wait a second.

1071
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:02,270
(All right, wait a second.)

1072
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,440
- "Wait a second." - Then it'll be mine.

1073
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,140
I'm sure he doesn't have it.

1074
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,240
Bring it in front of me. Then I'll admit.

1075
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,570
Bring it.

1076
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,870
I mean...

1077
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,040
This is right.

1078
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,700
It clearly says so.

1079
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:16,200
(It says deodorant.)

1080
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,740
- Bring it. - It says so.

1081
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,570
- Don't be so sure. - Bring it!

1082
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,940
- I got it. - Isn't that hair spray?

1083
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,940
It says deodorant.

1084
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,970
- It's hair spray. - No.

1085
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,340
It's not.

1086
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,840
(He really didn't want to admit that it's deodorant.)

1087
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,870
- It's deodorant. - No way.

1088
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,370
- It's hair spray. - You spray it on your armpits.

1089
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,310
It's for your armpits. Okay, who's next?

1090
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,970
I have almost everything at home.

1091
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,370
- It's Kwang Soo's turn. - Okay.

1092
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,270
- I got a lottery ticket. - That's tricky.

1093
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,840
- It's a lottery ticket. - Lottery ticket?

1094
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:44,340
- That's tricky. - It's a lottery ticket.

1095
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,340
- Lottery ticket? - I don't think he has it.

1096
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,170
- Do you have it? - Hold on a second.

1097
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,600
Hold on.

1098
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,970
Is any kind of lottery ticket acceptable?

1099
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,400
- Right. - Sure.

1100
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,770
(Well, then.)

1101
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:58,040
- Wait a second. - Do you have a lottery ticket?

1102
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,470
- Wait a second. - Do you have a lottery ticket?

1103
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,170
- Do you really have it? - Let me check first.

1104
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,940
(I shall bring the item to you if you give me some time.)

1105
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,940
- "Wait a second." - Wait a second.

1106
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,810
- This is crazy. - Wait a second.

1107
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,970
- Hold on. - This is now getting scary.

1108
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,370
(People usually throw it away when it's a dud.)

1109
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:14,770
There you go.

1110
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:17,240
- His reaction is too funny. - Does he really have it at home?

1111
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,740
- Don't lose hope yet. - You don't keep a dud at home.

1112
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,070
- This won't make sense. - No way.

1113
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:26,270
(Is he really...)

1114
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:29,400
(returning with a lottery ticket?)

1115
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,340
(He's now going to meet the members.)

1116
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,970
- No, right? - It's not a scratcher.

1117
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,500
But this is also a lottery ticket, right?

1118
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,070
- That's right. - That sure is a lottery ticket.

1119
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,970
- My gosh! - He sure has one.

1120
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,240
(He's taken aback to see him have one.)

1121
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,500
- It's right. - The one with six numbers.

1122
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:46,840
My gosh.

1123
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,600
- So you have it at home. - It was a dud.

1124
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,970
He bought it on September, 2016.

1125
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,810
And he still has it at home?

1126
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:54,470
- This is crazy. - But it's the lottery ticket.

1127
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:55,970
Let's scratch it while we're at it.

1128
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,270
Is it his or yours? Decide on that.

1129
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,970
- Why all of a sudden? - It's mine.

1130
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:02,170
- Is it yours? - I lose a point, but it's mine.

1131
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:05,870
- But you have to give it to him. - Wasn't that a gift for me?

1132
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:08,870
Wait. Did you buy it with your money or the staff's?

1133
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,500
- This will turn the tables. - Right.

1134
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,740
I borrowed money from them.

1135
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:14,840
I plan to pay them back.

1136
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,440
- No, make it clear. - Just in case you win.

1137
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,970
- How much was it? - It's Se Chan's.

1138
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,040
- It was a dollar. - It's the gift after all.

1139
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,810
I'll pay two dollars.

1140
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:26,040
- 2 dollars? - I'll pay 3 dollars.

1141
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,340
Three dollars.

1142
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,440
- I'll pay 5 dollars for it. - 5 dollars?

1143
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,870
- All right, let him have it. - It's done.

1144
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,040
(They close the deal right away.)

1145
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,270
(All of a sudden?)

1146
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,670
- Five dollars are reasonable. - I did that once.

1147
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:36,670
Give him five dollars.

1148
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:38,100
(A 1-dollar ticket turned into a 5-dollar one.)

1149
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,740
You hustlers.

1150
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:42,240
Give a dollar each for Se Chan and the staff, and you take the rest.

1151
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,140
(Jae Seok and Haha did a great job on fooling Seok Jin again.)

1152
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,970
- Give him five dollars. - That was a nice decoy.

1153
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,740
If I win some money, it'll all be mine.

1154
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,340
(He's scratching the ticket with much excitement.)

1155
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,740
- How much is the prize money? - It's 500,000 dollars.

1156
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,970
- Look for a 4. - Okay, the lucky number is 4.

1157
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:58,300
If there's a 4, then I gain 500,000 dollars.

1158
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,300
If there's a 4, I gain 500,000 dollars.

1159
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,600
- You just need a four? - Yes.

1160
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:04,570
Please. Let me give them a lesson.

1161
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:05,870
(Once there's a 4, you'll all be regretting.)

1162
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:06,970
Look.

1163
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:09,470
It's 3, 4... I got 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

1164
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:10,800
- Only four is missing. - I see.

1165
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,700
(He has only one number remaining. He's got a good feeling about this.)

1166
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,670
It's one.

1167
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:18,700
- What is this? - It's a dud.

1168
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,870
- Is this all? - Yes.

1169
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,200
(He was scratching without even knowing the rule.)

1170
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,300
- Kwang Soo gets minus one point. - All right.

1171
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,170
Here's the results of Dangerous Gifts.

1172
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,870
Jae Seok, Kwang Soo, and Seok Jin get minus one point each.

1173
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,770
- Oh, dear. - Stop with that teasing.

1174
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,570
Here, take these Whale Badges.

1175
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:40,570
It's for those who got a deduction in points.

1176
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:42,400
(They're given mysterious Whale Badges.)

1177
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,870
- What is this? - It's small.

1178
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:45,970
What is this for?

1179
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:48,600
(Does today's mission have something to do with whales?)

1180
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,800
Here's today's real mission.

1181
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,770
It's the fourth part of Global Project.

1182
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:54,170
It's called Dangerous Choices.

1183
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:56,100
Dangerous Choices?

1184
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,100
If every one of the members clears a mission,

1185
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:02,370
today's race and the shooting will end right away.

1186
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:07,340
But if at least one of you fails to clear the mission,

1187
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:11,840
one person will be given a Tour Sticker.

1188
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:15,440
- There will be many Stickers. - This is horrible.

1189
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,640
Also, you will each have to earn scores throughout the race.

1190
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,640
- You got a deduction just now. - Right.

1191
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,770
You'll be given a Whale Badge according to a certain standard.

1192
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:28,200
In the end, the person with the most number of badges...

1193
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,570
In the end, the person with the most number of badges...

1194
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:34,900
will ride a whale-watching ferry...

1195
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:36,870
- which departs at 5am... - Whale-watching ferry!

1196
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:38,670
in Ulsan tomorrow.

1197
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:42,100
(One of them will have to ride the whale-watching ferry.)

1198
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,200
What time?

1199
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,300
Did you say 5am?

1200
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:46,900
Then you have to depart at 1am at least.

1201
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,470
- We have to leave immediately. - One person?

1202
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,270
- This is no joke. - My gosh.

1203
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:54,840
The one with the most number of Whale Badges...

1204
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:58,270
- will pick one member to go with. - My gosh!

1205
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:01,170
The two will go together to watch the whales, the symbol for luck.

1206
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:02,770
On their trip,

1207
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,700
if they get to see a whale,

1208
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:07,800
- they won't get a Tour Sticker. - I see.

1209
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,170
- If they don't get to see one... - See whales?

1210
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:11,700
Did you say whales?

1211
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,100
I've never seen a whale in my entire life.

1212
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,970
- Are you serious? - At 5am?

1213
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,740
(They'll be given Whale Badges according to hidden rules.)

1214
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:23,740
(The Whale Badges will decide who will go on the trip.)

1215
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:27,970
(Those who figure out the hidden rule will be safe from the penalty.)

1216
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:29,470
(Will the members be able to guess?)

1217
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:31,270
- Is there something hidden? - Is there?

1218
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:33,270
So we have to find out why we are given the Whale Badges.

1219
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:34,500
Right.

1220
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:36,470
First mission you need to clear together is called...

1221
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,770
- Dangerous Household Items. - What is that?

1222
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:41,070
Among the household items in this house,

1223
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:44,570
- grab one item with you. - So it depends on your luck.

1224
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:47,040
By any chance, did you assume that I'd give permission to all of this?

1225
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:49,970
- What if I reject... - That's what I'm saying.

1226
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:52,270
- What if he says no? - I know.

1227
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:54,170
Please put your socks in, So Min.

1228
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:55,740
- Gosh. - It stinks.

1229
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:56,970
- Can I have some socks? - Seriously.

1230
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,840
I hear sticky noises whenever you walk around.

1231
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,940
- It's not true. - Sticky noises.

1232
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,400
- Household items? - Household items.

1233
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,970
(They start looking.)

1234
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:08,270
So there are hidden rules which only the staff members know.

1235
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:10,640
- What should we pick? - Should it be something long?

1236
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:11,770
What should I pick?

1237
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:12,970
(They're being careful.)

1238
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:15,200
I'll just take this and not think further about it.

1239
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:18,600
(After searching through Se Chan's house,)

1240
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:22,640
(they pick kitchen scissors,)

1241
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,440
(a cleaning roller,)

1242
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,470
Okay.

1243
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,540
(and even a cologne bottle.)

1244
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:29,800
- A cologne. - Kwang Soo!

1245
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,100
Yes, I'm done.

1246
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,300
(They're done choosing the items without knowing the mission.)

1247
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:35,870
Are you done picking?

1248
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:36,940
- Yes. - Yes.

1249
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:40,800
From now on, you will take turns...

1250
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:45,370
to put up a tower with the items you've brought.

1251
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,340
With this?

1252
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:49,900
- Where did you find that anyway? - But...

1253
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:53,270
you must put these cubes between each item.

1254
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,370
(They must put up a tower with the items and the cubes.)

1255
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,970
- We have a table. - How do we...

1256
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:01,600
We can use this table when we pile the items up.

1257
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,670
(We need to focus!)

1258
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:04,240
(Deep in thought)

1259
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:06,770
How about we flip the table...

1260
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:08,870
and put this bottle underneath?

1261
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,470
It's too small to balance.

1262
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,370
Who brought this cologne?

1263
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,270
- Unbelievable. - Kwang Soo, seriously.

1264
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:19,600
Do you want me to take it back?

1265
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,200
That cologne ruined everything.

1266
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,670
Who brought this?

1267
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:25,500
- Why would you bring this? - Why did you bring it?

1268
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,200
Asks the person who brought a useless stick.

1269
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:30,540
(Both of them are just as useless.)

1270
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,870
- Jae Seok, you're about to ruin it. - This isn't just a stick!

1271
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,200
- What kind of stick did I bring? - I bet you will lose today.

1272
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,340
If I am chosen, I will choose you to come with me.

1273
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:39,900
(Kwang Soo is chosen.)

1274
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,400
I'll choose you to come with me.

1275
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,400
I think this side is slanted.

1276
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:46,800
- It's because of the cologne. - What is this hair doing here?

1277
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,800
(Is this hair?)

1278
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,840
(Shaking)

1279
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,340
- Don't touch it! - What are you doing?

1280
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,070
- Don't touch it! - What are you doing?

1281
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,970
(Flinching)

1282
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,840
That hair isn't that important.

1283
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,770
- I'll pull all of your hair out. - Hey.

1284
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,870
Jong Kook, try your best, but his stick...

1285
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:02,140
I will do it.

1286
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,400
- I will do it. - He said he will do it.

1287
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,200
- You're noisy. Go outside. - This one should be...

1288
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,200
Jae Seok, be quiet!

1289
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,570
Hear me out. At the end, I will balance this on the tower.

1290
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:12,770
- At the end, with his stick, - It will stand.

1291
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,500
let him take all the blame.

1292
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,770
(This is the big picture in mind.)

1293
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,340
Let him take all the blame.

1294
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:20,600
Hey, I shouldn't be the one. Kwang Soo should be responsible.

1295
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,070
- Don't touch it. - Leave it alone.

1296
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:24,770
That one is a hard one too. Who brought the feather duster?

1297
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,400
I brought it.

1298
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,170
You did?

1299
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,570
That's understandable.

1300
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:30,570
(He's intimidated.)

1301
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:31,740
That's understandable.

1302
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,070
Balance them for me.

1303
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,470
- This is leaning toward this side. - You must feel frustrated now.

1304
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:37,300
- The staff must feel frustrated. - Jong Kook, move it to this side.

1305
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,800
- Don't you? - It has to go this way.

1306
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,670
- We are almost done. - Why isn't this working?

1307
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,700
- We are almost done. - Why isn't this working?

1308
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,570
(Crashing down)

1309
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,100
(Oh, no. We were so close to finishing it.)

1310
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,640
- It's all because of the cologne. - You have failed.

1311
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,070
- I didn't even get to try mine. - Kwang Soo.

1312
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:55,170
- This should have been on top. - Why did you bring the cologne?

1313
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:56,540
- All right. - To finish that...

1314
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,100
- All of you have failed. - Yes, we have.

1315
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,570
One of you will receive the Whale Badge.

1316
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,500
One of you will receive the Whale Badge.

1317
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,100
(Who will be the recipient of 1 Whale Badge?)

1318
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,600
It will be Jae Seok.

1319
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,670
- Why? - Yes!

1320
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,270
(Jae Seok is the recipient.)

1321
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:09,500
(Why is it me?)

1322
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,100
- Why do I have to get one? - Okay!

1323
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,170
(Why is he getting it?)

1324
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:13,870
- Why did he get one? - We have to figure that out.

1325
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:14,970
It must be that!

1326
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,200
- Okay! - What is it?

1327
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,940
- Can I tell them? - I figured it out.

1328
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:18,940
We have to find the reason why.

1329
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:20,970
It's because he brought the longest item.

1330
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,700
- No, that's incorrect. - It's incorrect?

1331
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:25,140
Move your feet.

1332
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,740
- It could be the penalty. - What is it? Why?

1333
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,470
- Did he get it? - Okay. Haha told me his answer.

1334
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:31,540
(He's known to be quick-witted.)

1335
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:35,500
(Did he really find out the hidden rule?)

1336
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,270
(Haha's answer is...)

1337
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:39,400
"It's because Jae Seok is ugly."

1338
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,500
(Haha's answer is because Jae Seok is ugly.)

1339
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,200
(Somehow, it sounds convincing. Is that why?)

1340
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,700
- What are you trying to do here? - What?

1341
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:47,900
- That's my opinion, Jae Seok. - Goodness.

1342
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,800
All right. Why don't you mark only one piece of paper for us?

1343
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,970
- Mark it a dud. - Okay.

1344
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:55,500
- Whoever gets it is chosen? - Yes.

1345
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,600
(Whoever gets the marked paper is chosen.)

1346
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,800
To be honest, regarding this game,

1347
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,040
I believe Jae Seok should receive one.

1348
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,900
- Why? - It's because...

1349
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,740
Let me be blunt. Seok Jin and my items...

1350
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:08,640
They pile up in a stable manner. I can even show you now.

1351
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,870
- Show us. - Will they still work?

1352
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:11,370
Look. They are stable.

1353
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:12,970
- Mine works too. - I agree with Haha.

1354
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:14,940
- Ours work too. - If they do, I will let you off.

1355
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:15,940
They'll work.

1356
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,900
- I can balance it. Look. - Will it really work?

1357
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,240
If yours work too, I will accept it.

1358
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,340
It has to last five seconds after you put it on.

1359
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,940
- Gosh! - In 5, 4,

1360
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,140
- 3, 2, 1. - It's not a problem at all.

1361
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,270
- This isn't a problem at all. - Kwang Soo is helping.

1362
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:28,300
You all saw this, right?

1363
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,070
That's not it. The thing is, you two made a mistake.

1364
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:31,370
Didn't you make it or not?

1365
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,100
He looks like a magistrate. He turned into a magistrate.

1366
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,670
(He's the strictest magistrate.)

1367
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:36,940
- Hey, think about it. - Hey.

1368
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,470
Can you talk to this magistrate for me?

1369
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,600
And say what?

1370
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,970
- This doesn't make sense. - I can't do this.

1371
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:43,500
- Tell him it's a variety show. - How can we add this on the pile?

1372
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,500
Everyone, everyone.

1373
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,540
Not getting the Tour Sticker is crucial,

1374
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,200
but I will keep getting the Badges and choose...

1375
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,570
one of you to come with me.

1376
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:54,900
- Oh, he's right. I forgot about it. - I mean it.

1377
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,100
All right. Let's go with eight pieces of paper.

1378
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:59,170
- All right. I agree. - Okay, Jae Seok.

1379
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:00,970
- Let the papers decide. - Jae Seok, I agree with you.

1380
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:02,500
- Let's go with these papers. - I want Kwang Soo to get picked.

1381
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,740
Or you can come with me to watch the whales.

1382
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,570
I guess you want to watch the whales with me.

1383
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:10,140
(I have forgotten about Jong Kook.)

1384
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,300
- It's a twist within a twist. - All right then.

1385
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,940
- All right then. - It's a twist within a twist.

1386
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,700
Why don't the seven of us pick the paper?

1387
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,070
(He retreats.)

1388
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:19,970
(In front of Jong Kook, Jae Seok feels small.)

1389
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,640
- We should make him distribute. - Okay.

1390
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,670
Whoever gets the dud will be ruined.

1391
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:25,970
(The chosen one's chance will increase.)

1392
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:28,100
- Please. - If I'm chosen, I am finished.

1393
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,200
- Don't unfold it yet. - How does this make sense?

1394
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,540
I am too nervous to open it.

1395
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:34,670
I hope someone before me gets it.

1396
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:36,800
- I hope someone gets the dud. - Let it be the dud.

1397
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,370
(Ji Hyo is exempted.)

1398
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:39,370
So Min is usually lucky.

1399
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:40,740
No, I bet she will get the dud.

1400
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,270
In 1, 2, 3.

1401
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:43,600
(So Min is exempted.)

1402
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,770
- So Min, come here. Come to me. - Hey, move aside.

1403
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,870
(We are lucky. We survived!)

1404
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:49,700
- We are safe. - He's the new unlucky member.

1405
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,170
- Is it my turn? - Why don't you go last?

1406
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:52,700
If he gets it, he will go on the trip right away.

1407
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,040
- Right. - That's right.

1408
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,600
- I should open mine... - You should open yours.

1409
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,400
- since I am not that unlucky. - You two don't have any Stickers.

1410
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:59,070
There's no way.

1411
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,270
In 1, 2, 3.

1412
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:02,700
(He spoke too soon.)

1413
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:05,400
(Seok Jin gets one Tour Sticker.)

1414
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,740
(He said he's not that unlucky.)

1415
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:07,740
- Gosh. - You have one, right?

1416
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,570
- This is unbelievable. - Let's check ours too.

1417
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,500
- We are all exempted. - All right.

1418
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,540
- Let's keep them. Use them later. - This is amazing.

1419
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,700
- I am relieved. - Seok Jin got it.

1420
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,840
The first round of Dangerous Choices wasn't successful.

1421
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,770
Before we start the second round,

1422
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:23,640
- it's lunchtime. - Yes, it is.

1423
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:26,700
We will order the food you'd like to have.

1424
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,200
- What is this? - This is nice.

1425
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,700
- He might be up to something. - There might be a hidden agenda.

1426
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,040
Hey, if you order something special,

1427
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,300
- there might be something. - I agree.

1428
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,340
You might have to face a penalty.

1429
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:38,340
Hold on, this could be a mission where we have to unify our choices.

1430
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:41,170
- Or they have to be all different. - No, I don't think so.

1431
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:43,100
Or maybe there's a budget limit.

1432
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,940
- No way. - They won't be that petty.

1433
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:48,700
- They should feed us properly. - Let's not overlap.

1434
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:49,970
All right, let's do that.

1435
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,070
- Se Chan, what do you want? - I want...

1436
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:53,200
I'd like to have ganjjajang.

1437
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,440
I'd like to have tangjjamyeon.

1438
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,270
Hey, we are going to order tangsuyuk separately.

1439
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:58,200
- No, we're not. - We are not?

1440
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,640
I guess we're not.

1441
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:01,840
- Let's order one. - All right.

1442
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,800
- Order large tangsuyuk. - Large tangsuyuk.

1443
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,600
I want jjamjjamyeon.

1444
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,100
I want beef brisket jjamppong.

1445
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,800
- Hey. - I want stir-fried jjamppong.

1446
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,040
Kwang Soo chose white broth jjamppong.

1447
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,240
Haha chose beef brisket jjamppong, right?

1448
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,340
Yes, but may I switch to jaengban jjajang?

1449
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:15,500
- You'd like to change? - Yes.

1450
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,500
I think something must be up. They wouldn't give us the menu.

1451
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,970
They would just ask us.

1452
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:21,700
- I think this might be a mission. - It's seven dollars.

1453
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,970
We have ordered now.

1454
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:26,270
The second round is Dangerous Orders.

1455
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:29,140
(The 2nd round of Dangerous Choices is Dangerous Orders.)

1456
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,600
- You said this wasn't the mission. - No way.

1457
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,200
Since you didn't unify your choices,

1458
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,140
- you have failed. - Hold on.

1459
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,170
(They have failed.)

1460
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:37,600
Everyone, sit down!

1461
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,640
Wait.

1462
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,200
What did I tell you?

1463
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,140
Didn't I tell you we should unify our choices?

1464
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,140
He became a thug.

1465
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:45,800
- Didn't I tell you or not? - He looks like a thug now.

1466
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,500
- You did tell us. - Didn't I tell you?

1467
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,100
- Se Chan is teasing you a lot. - Didn't I tell you or not?

1468
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,500
- You did tell us. - He's teasing you.

1469
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,570
- I told you so, didn't I? - We have different tastes in food.

1470
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,640
- I believed you. - All right, the Whale Badge...

1471
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,800
This is driving me crazy.

1472
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,340
- Se Chan, take the Badge. - What?

1473
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,800
(Since you failed, Se Chan, take the Badge.)

1474
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,970
- Is it me? Is it really me? - What's going on?

1475
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,970
- What is it? - I know! I know!

1476
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:04,040
- Why? - Me?

1477
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,240
What did you order?

1478
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,940
- Only you ordered jjajangmyeon. - I did.

1479
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,540
- I ordered jaengban jjajang. - What is it?

1480
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:10,140
- Why is it me? - I know!

1481
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:13,270
(Ji Hyo seems to have figured it out.)

1482
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,200
(It's because Se Chan was the only one who ordered jjajangmyeon.)

1483
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,500
Why is it me?

1484
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,900
(Wait. This is only the 2nd round.)

1485
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,200
I ordered jaengban jjajang.

1486
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,570
(Did she figure it out already?)

1487
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:25,770
- That's incorrect. - I guess it's not correct.

1488
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:27,200
- Ji Hyo, what did you tell him? - What was your answer?

1489
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,740
I said it's because he ordered jjajangmyeon.

1490
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:30,600
Is it the same reason from the first round?

1491
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,040
I told you we should unify our choices. Goodness.

1492
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,670
- Haha. - We...

1493
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:36,540
(He has a mysterious look.)

1494
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,600
Is it correct?

1495
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,870
(Did Haha tell him the correct answer?)

1496
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,340
He said, "It depends on your mood."

1497
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,100
What? "It depends on your mood"?

1498
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,400
(Wasn't that funny?)

1499
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,040
- Haha. - I thought he was about to curse.

1500
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,800
(Haha's guess is obviously incorrect.)

1501
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,040
It's about me. I should get it.

1502
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,500
(It's all right as long as it's funny.)

1503
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,570
Se Chan, what did you do when you were standing here?

1504
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:56,100
Do what you were doing. Try to remember.

1505
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,700
- I massaged his shoulders. - What is the reason?

1506
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,600
- I massaged his shoulders. - Then what did you do?

1507
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,270
Are you certain it's not because they are ugly?

1508
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:03,970
Is it not because we're ugly?

1509
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,970
- I figured it out. - It's the reason for every mission?

1510
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:08,070
Aren't I right?

1511
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:09,670
You are giving the Badge to the ugliest member first.

1512
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,600
Kwang Soo will be next.

1513
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,400
- What are you talking about? - Kwang Soo is next.

1514
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,500
- It's not me. - Isn't he next?

1515
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,070
- Why was I picked? - Wait!

1516
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:18,740
To be honest, I know the answer.

1517
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:21,340
I know the answer. Can I tell you? I won't try to be funny.

1518
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,600
- Yes. - Okay.

1519
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,970
- You just gave me a chance. - Sure.

1520
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,840
(He looks pretty confident of his answer.)

1521
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,340
- I didn't do anything. - Don't pretend you are sharp.

1522
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:34,470
The first person who spoke after you said we failed the mission.

1523
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:36,240
- Goodness. - Hold on.

1524
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,600
(What is that look?)

1525
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:41,740
(Did he really figure it out?)

1526
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:43,500
That's incorrect, but his answer was very close.

1527
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:45,970
- What did you say? - What is it?

1528
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:47,500
(Can you tell us what it is?)

1529
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,140
- Is that so? - What is it?

1530
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,240
(All right. I got it now.)

1531
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,540
Consequently,

1532
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,040
you failed the second round,

1533
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,870
- but your food will arrive. - Right.

1534
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:57,570
The owner of the dish...

1535
00:56:57,670 --> 00:57:01,570
that the delivery man puts down first will receive a Tour Sticker.

1536
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:03,540
(Whoever gets their dish first will get a Sticker.)

1537
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,370
There are two orders of stir-fried jjamppong.

1538
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:08,440
- We have to settle between us. - You have to settle between you.

1539
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,200
If he puts down tangsuyuk first, we are off the hook?

1540
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,540
(What about the dish for all of us?)

1541
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:14,800
Since Se Chan suggested ordering it,

1542
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,270
you have both tangsuyuk and ganjjajang.

1543
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:19,070
(Tangsuyuk and ganjjajang will count as Se Chan's.)

1544
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,240
Let's order large tangsuyuk.

1545
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,900
(He ordered tangsuyuk because he felt sorry for Seok Jin.)

1546
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:25,770
He will be in the lead.

1547
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:27,600
- Se Chan, just give up already. - Se Chan.

1548
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,770
- You are done. - It's over.

1549
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:29,900
- It's game over. - Just go.

1550
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:30,900
(Se Chan is a rising, unlucky member.)

1551
00:57:30,911 --> 00:57:33,341
We ordered your dishes.

1552
00:57:33,341 --> 00:57:36,441
Here's the third mission.

1553
00:57:36,441 --> 00:57:38,211
We invited a special guest.

1554
00:57:38,211 --> 00:57:39,241
What?

1555
00:57:39,241 --> 00:57:41,041
(Who is the special guest?)

1556
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,871
- Who is it? - Is it Se Hyung?

1557
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:50,811
(Is Se Hyung here to check on his younger brother?)

1558
00:57:50,971 --> 00:57:53,341
- He's here again. - It's the massage therapist.

1559
00:57:53,341 --> 00:57:55,341
(Why is he here again?)

1560
00:57:55,341 --> 00:57:56,341
Come on.

1561
00:57:56,341 --> 00:57:58,641
I'll explain again for the new members.

1562
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:01,941
He's a masseur and Running Man's mascot.

1563
00:58:01,941 --> 00:58:03,041
(It's Masseur Kim Hyung Joon.)

1564
00:58:03,671 --> 00:58:08,841
(Your body is in pain every time you see him.)

1565
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:10,811
The rule is the same.

1566
00:58:11,041 --> 00:58:14,811
You clear the mission if none of you make a sound for 10 seconds.

1567
00:58:14,811 --> 00:58:16,641
Everyone has to get a massage, right?

1568
00:58:16,641 --> 00:58:18,671
- It's impossible to stay silent. - I know.

1569
00:58:18,671 --> 00:58:21,411
- It's impossible. - So Min should try it.

1570
00:58:21,711 --> 00:58:23,871
- So Min should go. - Get a hand massage.

1571
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,971
It feels refreshing.

1572
00:58:24,971 --> 00:58:26,711
Just don't make any sounds.

1573
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:27,971
Shouldn't it be her shoulders?

1574
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:30,441
- Get ready. - Please relax.

1575
00:58:30,441 --> 00:58:32,041
- You have to endure it. - Relax.

1576
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:33,671
(Did he feel my tension?)

1577
00:58:33,671 --> 00:58:35,071
- Endure it. - It's shorter than you think.

1578
00:58:35,071 --> 00:58:36,341
- Start. - It will be short.

1579
00:58:36,341 --> 00:58:37,341
(She moans.)

1580
00:58:37,611 --> 00:58:38,611
(She moans.)

1581
00:58:39,411 --> 00:58:41,911
Come on, why did you cry?

1582
00:58:41,911 --> 00:58:43,571
- It hurts. - You should endure it.

1583
00:58:43,571 --> 00:58:44,971
- She should go last. - It hurts.

1584
00:58:44,971 --> 00:58:47,641
- You should go last. - That's okay.

1585
00:58:47,641 --> 00:58:49,241
Come here, So Min. It's okay.

1586
00:58:49,241 --> 00:58:51,771
- He's so strong. - You did a good job.

1587
00:58:51,941 --> 00:58:54,311
- We haven't started the mission. - No, not yet.

1588
00:58:54,311 --> 00:58:56,311
- It was a test. - That's right.

1589
00:58:56,311 --> 00:58:58,041
- Ji Hyo is good at enduring pain. - That's true.

1590
00:58:58,041 --> 00:58:59,711
- She endured it last time. - Get a shoulder massage.

1591
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,841
Try the shoulders. Have a seat.

1592
00:59:00,841 --> 00:59:02,611
- She will endure it. - Have a seat.

1593
00:59:02,911 --> 00:59:05,541
- Do you want a chair? - No, it's okay.

1594
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:09,071
- Get ready, set, go. - It's Ji Hyo's turn.

1595
00:59:09,071 --> 00:59:10,211
(She squirms.)

1596
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:11,541
- She's enduring it. - Endure it.

1597
00:59:11,611 --> 00:59:14,871
(She's determined to endure the pain.)

1598
00:59:15,141 --> 00:59:16,711
- You're a champion. - She's impressive.

1599
00:59:16,711 --> 00:59:18,341
- You're done halfway. - Endure it.

1600
00:59:18,341 --> 00:59:19,541
(She grimaces.)

1601
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:22,241
- She'll make it. - You're doing well today.

1602
00:59:22,241 --> 00:59:23,571
- Stop. - She made it.

1603
00:59:23,571 --> 00:59:25,241
(Ji Hyo succeeds.)

1604
00:59:25,241 --> 00:59:27,441
(She endures the pain by making an ugly face.)

1605
00:59:27,441 --> 00:59:29,141
She's so impressive.

1606
00:59:29,611 --> 00:59:32,371
- You looked the ugliest. - Seriously, Ji Hyo.

1607
00:59:32,511 --> 00:59:35,041
(This is what he says after all she went through.)

1608
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:37,441
- She looked the ugliest ever? - I'm serious.

1609
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:39,611
- I've never seen her that ugly. - Jae Seok.

1610
00:59:39,611 --> 00:59:41,411
- Let's see how you do it. - Goodness.

1611
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,141
Sir, that was so painful.

1612
00:59:43,141 --> 00:59:45,911
I wanted to draw a runny nose on her.

1613
00:59:45,941 --> 00:59:47,571
- To make her more ugly? - It really hurt.

1614
00:59:47,571 --> 00:59:49,541
Now that Ji Hyo finished,

1615
00:59:49,541 --> 00:59:51,441
there's no one else who can endure it.

1616
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,841
(The rest are scaredy-cats.)

1617
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:56,341
- This part hurts the most. - Haha endured it before.

1618
00:59:56,341 --> 00:59:57,771
- That's right. - It's Haha's turn.

1619
00:59:57,771 --> 00:59:59,871
Can you massage this part?

1620
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,441
(Haha is forced to go.)

1621
01:00:01,941 --> 01:00:04,011
- His outfit isn't right for this. - Get ready.

1622
01:00:04,241 --> 01:00:06,241
- Hold on a minute. - Haha is impressive too.

1623
01:00:06,241 --> 01:00:08,371
Can you give me something I can bite on?

1624
01:00:10,671 --> 01:00:12,241
I don't want your foot.

1625
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:14,241
You can bite this stuffed dog.

1626
01:00:14,441 --> 01:00:16,241
- Get ready. - Isn't this your dog's toy?

1627
01:00:16,241 --> 01:00:18,041
- Set. - Didn't your dog play with it?

1628
01:00:18,041 --> 01:00:19,041
That's right.

1629
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:20,041
(He stuffs his mouth with it.)

1630
01:00:20,511 --> 01:00:23,211
- It belongs to his dog. - Start.

1631
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:25,241
Endure the pain.

1632
01:00:25,641 --> 01:00:27,871
(He feels the pain.)

1633
01:00:27,871 --> 01:00:29,441
Just don't make any sounds.

1634
01:00:29,441 --> 01:00:32,111
5 seconds have passed. You have 5 seconds left.

1635
01:00:32,711 --> 01:00:34,411
(He expresses pain through his body.)

1636
01:00:34,511 --> 01:00:35,841
Everyone should endure it.

1637
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:39,411
(Please stop. I can't do it anymore.)

1638
01:00:39,411 --> 01:00:41,041
- He's impressive. - It's a success.

1639
01:00:41,041 --> 01:00:42,871
(Haha succeeds.)

1640
01:00:42,871 --> 01:00:46,241
(Haha endures the pain.)

1641
01:00:46,241 --> 01:00:47,841
It's our turn, so move out of the way.

1642
01:00:48,841 --> 01:00:51,211
- Haha. - Get out of the way.

1643
01:00:51,211 --> 01:00:52,871
Go to the back.

1644
01:00:52,871 --> 01:00:53,911
(Enjoy the pain in the back.)

1645
01:00:53,911 --> 01:00:56,311
- How many more do we have? - I feel bad for them.

1646
01:00:56,311 --> 01:00:58,611
What if we fail after what they've been through?

1647
01:00:58,611 --> 01:00:59,811
(The rest are hopeless.)

1648
01:00:59,811 --> 01:01:01,611
Only the weak members remain.

1649
01:01:01,611 --> 01:01:03,641
Haha, are you okay?

1650
01:01:03,841 --> 01:01:04,841
(Do I look okay?)

1651
01:01:04,841 --> 01:01:06,671
- What's wrong? - Is he okay?

1652
01:01:06,671 --> 01:01:08,771
You shouldn't lie down during a shoot.

1653
01:01:09,141 --> 01:01:11,041
(He disapproves of Haha.)

1654
01:01:11,641 --> 01:01:13,741
- You should get up. - Get up, Haha.

1655
01:01:13,741 --> 01:01:16,141
You shouldn't lie down during the shoot.

1656
01:01:17,611 --> 01:01:19,411
- Look at Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

1657
01:01:19,411 --> 01:01:21,311
It's really painful.

1658
01:01:21,311 --> 01:01:22,941
- Kwang Soo is next. - He can endure it.

1659
01:01:22,941 --> 01:01:24,411
- He's good. - He'll endure it.

1660
01:01:24,411 --> 01:01:25,941
(He exhales.)

1661
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:30,341
Sorry, but may I be anesthetized before we start?

1662
01:01:31,841 --> 01:01:32,941
Bite the stuffed dog.

1663
01:01:33,411 --> 01:01:34,711
(He can only depend on the dog.)

1664
01:01:34,711 --> 01:01:36,041
- Get ready. - Poor dog.

1665
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:37,311
Wait a minute.

1666
01:01:37,641 --> 01:01:39,771
- Start. - We can get off early if we pass.

1667
01:01:39,771 --> 01:01:41,941
Wait a minute, sir.

1668
01:01:41,941 --> 01:01:44,641
(He calls for a break as soon as it starts.)

1669
01:01:44,971 --> 01:01:46,841
- I feel strange. - What's wrong?

1670
01:01:47,041 --> 01:01:48,071
I can't endure it.

1671
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:49,771
(He whispers.)

1672
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:52,641
- You can do it. - Let's go, Kwang Soo.

1673
01:01:52,641 --> 01:01:54,311
- You'll be fine. - I really can't.

1674
01:01:54,311 --> 01:01:56,741
- Make him pass out for a while. - You can endure it.

1675
01:01:56,741 --> 01:01:57,911
Get ready.

1676
01:01:58,541 --> 01:02:00,341
Set, go.

1677
01:02:00,941 --> 01:02:02,241
(He snorts.)

1678
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:06,241
(Jong Kook covers his mouth completely.)

1679
01:02:06,541 --> 01:02:08,171
(He asks for help with his toes.)

1680
01:02:08,171 --> 01:02:09,441
You're almost done!

1681
01:02:09,671 --> 01:02:10,841
(Let me breathe.)

1682
01:02:10,841 --> 01:02:12,971
Look at the masseur.

1683
01:02:13,041 --> 01:02:14,341
You're almost done.

1684
01:02:14,341 --> 01:02:16,211
(Haha is shocked by the masseur.)

1685
01:02:16,741 --> 01:02:17,841
It's a success.

1686
01:02:18,311 --> 01:02:20,541
- Did you see him? - Did you see the masseur?

1687
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:22,941
He pressed while using his foot as a support.

1688
01:02:22,941 --> 01:02:24,241
That's how he pressed.

1689
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:25,671
(He's about to cry.)

1690
01:02:26,671 --> 01:02:29,941
(It's more like a combat.)

1691
01:02:30,341 --> 01:02:32,241
I thought he was doing martial arts.

1692
01:02:32,241 --> 01:02:33,771
(Gripping)

1693
01:02:33,771 --> 01:02:35,741
He blocked me from escaping.

1694
01:02:36,071 --> 01:02:37,641
I had nowhere to go.

1695
01:02:38,311 --> 01:02:40,141
Gosh, that was impressive.

1696
01:02:40,141 --> 01:02:42,311
- It was very impressive. - Jae Seok.

1697
01:02:42,311 --> 01:02:44,241
- We're in trouble. - It's your turn, Jae Seok.

1698
01:02:44,241 --> 01:02:46,241
He will be fine since he exercises a lot.

1699
01:02:46,241 --> 01:02:47,241
(It's another scaredy-cat.)

1700
01:02:48,311 --> 01:02:49,511
He lied down.

1701
01:02:49,541 --> 01:02:51,511
It's obvious he won't make it.

1702
01:02:51,511 --> 01:02:54,071
(They can already predict the outcome.)

1703
01:02:54,071 --> 01:02:55,811
(Failure is written on his face.)

1704
01:02:55,811 --> 01:02:57,511
- I can endure it. - Get ready.

1705
01:02:57,511 --> 01:02:59,041
Bite the stuffed dog.

1706
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,411
- Bite it. - It won't work.

1707
01:03:00,411 --> 01:03:02,571
Set, go.

1708
01:03:02,841 --> 01:03:03,841
(He snorts.)

1709
01:03:04,871 --> 01:03:05,911
There he goes.

1710
01:03:05,911 --> 01:03:08,841
(He makes a fuss.)

1711
01:03:09,611 --> 01:03:11,511
(He flaps his legs helplessly.)

1712
01:03:12,311 --> 01:03:15,041
(We will take care of your legs.)

1713
01:03:16,871 --> 01:03:21,071
(He grunts loudly.)

1714
01:03:21,411 --> 01:03:22,941
(Jae Seok fails.)

1715
01:03:23,211 --> 01:03:24,671
- It's a failure. - It must be painful.

1716
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,241
- Come on, Jae Seok. - I knew it.

1717
01:03:26,241 --> 01:03:28,711
(Once he makes a fuss, he will always make a fuss.)

1718
01:03:29,041 --> 01:03:30,441
Gosh.

1719
01:03:30,441 --> 01:03:32,511
- I knew it'd happen. - It's so painful.

1720
01:03:32,511 --> 01:03:35,711
Not all the members cleared the mission.

1721
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:37,441
Gosh, Jae Seok.

1722
01:03:37,441 --> 01:03:40,071
- It's too hard. - Who gets a Whale Badge?

1723
01:03:40,311 --> 01:03:44,411
Shouldn't the person who failed get a Whale Badge?

1724
01:03:44,511 --> 01:03:45,971
He might not get it.

1725
01:03:45,971 --> 01:03:47,641
- Isn't it obvious? - It could be Kwang Soo.

1726
01:03:47,641 --> 01:03:49,141
I bet it's Jae Seok.

1727
01:03:49,141 --> 01:03:50,941
It's hard to endure the pain.

1728
01:03:50,941 --> 01:03:53,641
(Will Jae Seok get a Whale Badge?)

1729
01:03:53,641 --> 01:03:55,511
- All right. - Who could it be?

1730
01:03:55,811 --> 01:03:57,471
- Is it... - Jae Seok.

1731
01:03:58,411 --> 01:03:59,541
See?

1732
01:03:59,611 --> 01:04:01,741
- Why me? - It's you.

1733
01:04:03,311 --> 01:04:04,771
Why do I get it?

1734
01:04:04,771 --> 01:04:05,771
(Haha knows the reason.)

1735
01:04:06,411 --> 01:04:08,041
There goes Haha.

1736
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:10,441
Haha is so quick-witted.

1737
01:04:10,441 --> 01:04:13,141
- Why is it me? - You made a sound.

1738
01:04:13,241 --> 01:04:17,611
- That can't be the reason. - The one who said the last thing...

1739
01:04:17,741 --> 01:04:21,541
(Haha's answer was close last time.)

1740
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:25,441
(Has he found out the hidden rule?)

1741
01:04:25,441 --> 01:04:27,111
It's very close but wrong.

1742
01:04:27,571 --> 01:04:29,171
Come on.

1743
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:31,941
Is the rule the same as before?

1744
01:04:31,941 --> 01:04:34,941
It is. Here's another hint.

1745
01:04:35,341 --> 01:04:37,811
Look at the people around you.

1746
01:04:37,871 --> 01:04:41,311
(What does he mean by that?)

1747
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:45,411
(Does one of them have a secret?)

1748
01:04:46,811 --> 01:04:50,971
(This was when Se Chan got a Whale Badge.)

1749
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:54,071
(So Min deliberately stopped Jong Kook.)

1750
01:04:54,071 --> 01:04:56,641
(Se Chan got a Whale Badge.)

1751
01:04:57,841 --> 01:05:00,771
(This is when Jae Seok got a Whale Badge.)

1752
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:04,841
(Jong Kook called on Jae Seok.)

1753
01:05:04,841 --> 01:05:08,341
(Jae Seok got a Whale Badge.)

1754
01:05:09,211 --> 01:05:13,941
(This all began this morning.)

1755
01:05:15,341 --> 01:05:17,341
(This was the Sangam SBS parking lot this morning.)

1756
01:05:17,341 --> 01:05:18,541
Hello.

1757
01:05:18,541 --> 01:05:20,811
(So Min had a private meeting with the producer.)

1758
01:05:20,811 --> 01:05:24,041
I'll give you a secret mission.

1759
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:28,211
(Is there a secret mission?)

1760
01:05:28,211 --> 01:05:31,041
You won't be alone in it. He'll join you.

1761
01:05:31,041 --> 01:05:32,211
I'll give it to both of you.

1762
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:34,241
Do we do it together?

1763
01:05:34,241 --> 01:05:35,741
(She has a partner.)

1764
01:05:36,971 --> 01:05:38,641
- So Min. - What's going on?

1765
01:05:38,641 --> 01:05:41,511
(Her partner for the secret mission is Jong Kook.)

1766
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:45,311
It's the presidential election two days after the show is aired.

1767
01:05:45,311 --> 01:05:47,211
- Is that so? - I see.

1768
01:05:47,211 --> 01:05:50,971
Today's secret mission is called Kook-Min's Pick.

1769
01:05:51,141 --> 01:05:54,311
It's Kook from Jong Kook and Min from So Min.

1770
01:05:54,311 --> 01:05:56,311
(Thus, the name of the mission.)

1771
01:05:57,041 --> 01:05:58,071
Kook-Min?

1772
01:05:58,311 --> 01:06:01,211
(That's why they're chosen.)

1773
01:06:01,341 --> 01:06:05,871
A member will get a Whale Badge when all members fail to pass.

1774
01:06:05,871 --> 01:06:07,441
- Whale Badge? - Someone will get it.

1775
01:06:07,441 --> 01:06:11,341
The two of you will decide who gets it.

1776
01:06:11,341 --> 01:06:12,711
- I see. - Here's how.

1777
01:06:12,711 --> 01:06:15,971
As soon as I announce that they failed to clear the mission,

1778
01:06:15,971 --> 01:06:20,241
you need to touch each other and call out the name...

1779
01:06:20,411 --> 01:06:23,571
of the person who will get it within a minute.

1780
01:06:23,571 --> 01:06:26,071
(They must touch and call out his name in 1 minute.)

1781
01:06:26,071 --> 01:06:29,141
The one to notice and tell me what the hidden mission is...

1782
01:06:29,141 --> 01:06:32,541
will be exempted from penalties for today.

1783
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:35,511
If more than three members notice it,

1784
01:06:35,511 --> 01:06:37,841
you'll be sent to the whale tour.

1785
01:06:37,841 --> 01:06:39,341
(They're punished if more than 3 notice it.)

1786
01:06:39,341 --> 01:06:42,241
Don't get playful and do something strange.

1787
01:06:42,771 --> 01:06:45,211
Don't do anything strange. Act natural, okay?

1788
01:06:45,211 --> 01:06:48,241
Honestly, I'm not good at hiding secrets.

1789
01:06:48,341 --> 01:06:49,411
Can you do it?

1790
01:06:49,411 --> 01:06:50,941
(They start their secret mission.)

1791
01:06:50,941 --> 01:06:52,741
- We can do it. - We can do it.

1792
01:06:54,811 --> 01:06:58,511
(This is how the hidden mission started.)

1793
01:06:59,241 --> 01:07:01,611
(Shall I give a Badge to Se Chan?)

1794
01:07:02,171 --> 01:07:04,941
(She pulled on Jong Kook.)

1795
01:07:04,941 --> 01:07:07,241
(She called out Se Chan's name.)

1796
01:07:07,971 --> 01:07:09,771
(How about Jae Seok this time?)

1797
01:07:10,871 --> 01:07:16,311
(Jong Kook hinted while pretending to look at Se Chan.)

1798
01:07:16,311 --> 01:07:19,671
(He called out Jae Seok while touching So Min's arm.)

1799
01:07:19,671 --> 01:07:24,241
(They've been acting naturally so far.)

1800
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:27,441
Look at the people around you.

1801
01:07:27,771 --> 01:07:31,411
(Look at the people around me?)

1802
01:07:31,511 --> 01:07:32,571
(Grabbing)

1803
01:07:32,571 --> 01:07:34,141
- What? - I knew it was you.

1804
01:07:34,141 --> 01:07:35,211
Why me?

1805
01:07:35,211 --> 01:07:36,911
- Me? Why me? - You're the spy, right?

1806
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:38,381
- It's not me. - It's him.

1807
01:07:38,381 --> 01:07:40,411
- Why me? Why? - I don't know what but it's him.

1808
01:07:40,411 --> 01:07:41,511
- What? - I'm sure it's him.

1809
01:07:41,511 --> 01:07:43,671
We don't know what it is but it's him.

1810
01:07:43,811 --> 01:07:44,881
It's Se Chan.

1811
01:07:45,911 --> 01:07:47,971
Pick a person who'll get a Tour Sticker.

1812
01:07:48,941 --> 01:07:50,041
It's Jae Seok.

1813
01:07:51,941 --> 01:07:54,011
- It's Jae Seok. - It's Jae Seok.

1814
01:07:54,241 --> 01:07:55,311
Why me?

1815
01:07:55,311 --> 01:07:57,241
- It has to be him. - Stop acting...

1816
01:07:57,881 --> 01:08:00,611
Stop acting like you're flustered. You're so shameless.

1817
01:08:00,711 --> 01:08:03,241
- I'm so flustered. - You screamed so it's over.

1818
01:08:03,511 --> 01:08:06,211
- I'm so flustered. - Anyhow, you...

1819
01:08:06,211 --> 01:08:08,341
- Let me say this. - It's your fault.

1820
01:08:08,381 --> 01:08:10,111
One of you will come with me.

1821
01:08:11,011 --> 01:08:13,141
I think it's kind of unfair for him.

1822
01:08:13,141 --> 01:08:14,971
- That's right. - This is my true opinion.

1823
01:08:14,971 --> 01:08:16,711
I agree.

1824
01:08:16,941 --> 01:08:19,641
Three people agreed it was unfair for me.

1825
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:20,811
- Seok Jin... - I'm being honest.

1826
01:08:20,941 --> 01:08:22,111
I think it's unfair.

1827
01:08:22,111 --> 01:08:23,771
1 of us 3 will take the Sticker.

1828
01:08:24,071 --> 01:08:25,541
1 of us 3 will take the Sticker.

1829
01:08:26,611 --> 01:08:28,381
- That's a great idea. - Great.

1830
01:08:28,381 --> 01:08:30,311
(The penalty goes to the Unlucky Trio.)

1831
01:08:30,311 --> 01:08:31,671
One of us will take it.

1832
01:08:31,671 --> 01:08:34,171
- I agree. - We'll play Incorrect Times Table.

1833
01:08:34,171 --> 01:08:35,511
- All right. - The loser gets the sticker.

1834
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:36,811
- You know the rules, right? - Yes.

1835
01:08:36,811 --> 01:08:38,841
The 10s have to be correct but the 1s have to be wrong.

1836
01:08:38,841 --> 01:08:40,811
3 times 9 is 24. Is this correct?

1837
01:08:40,811 --> 01:08:42,441
- Okay, I got it. - Okay.

1838
01:08:42,441 --> 01:08:44,241
- Set... - We'll give you the question.

1839
01:08:44,241 --> 01:08:47,171
- Incorrect Times Table - Incorrect Times Table

1840
01:08:47,171 --> 01:08:48,811
- 6 times 9 is? - 45

1841
01:08:48,911 --> 01:08:50,041
What?

1842
01:08:51,011 --> 01:08:52,881
- Hold on. - It has to be 50 something.

1843
01:08:52,881 --> 01:08:54,671
(That was wrong.)

1844
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:56,971
- Hold on. - It has to be 50 something.

1845
01:08:57,411 --> 01:08:58,511
You should have said 52.

1846
01:08:58,511 --> 01:08:59,671
- Is he done? - No way.

1847
01:08:59,671 --> 01:09:00,811
He's done.

1848
01:09:00,811 --> 01:09:01,911
He has to go.

1849
01:09:01,911 --> 01:09:03,511
(Seok Jin climbs to the top of the list within a day.)

1850
01:09:03,511 --> 01:09:05,341
- That was wrong. - It has to be after 50.

1851
01:09:05,381 --> 01:09:07,041
He's right after Se Chan.

1852
01:09:07,241 --> 01:09:08,341
- That's good. - This is great.

1853
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:10,711
This is so unpredictable.

1854
01:09:10,711 --> 01:09:12,141
We don't know about Seok Jin.

1855
01:09:12,141 --> 01:09:13,171
We don't know about Seok Jin.

1856
01:09:13,171 --> 01:09:15,411
- We have to conclude this today. - That's right.

1857
01:09:16,471 --> 01:09:21,241
(If you get 3 Stickers, you will be chosen to go.)

1858
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:22,381
- Do you have to leave right away? - You must.

1859
01:09:22,411 --> 01:09:23,641
This can't be!

1860
01:09:23,641 --> 01:09:24,641
(Which member will go on the Dangerous Tour?)

1861
01:09:24,641 --> 01:09:26,381
Your delivery food is on the first floor.

1862
01:09:26,381 --> 01:09:27,511
- It's here? - Yes.

1863
01:09:27,611 --> 01:09:30,471
It's the dish the delivery man puts down first as soon as he comes in.

1864
01:09:30,471 --> 01:09:31,471
Okay.

1865
01:09:31,911 --> 01:09:32,941
(The owner of the first dish...)

1866
01:09:32,941 --> 01:09:34,741
(to be served gets a Sticker.)

1867
01:09:35,411 --> 01:09:37,541
- He's here. - Your food is here.

1868
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:39,211
He'll come inside and put the food down.

1869
01:09:39,211 --> 01:09:41,571
There's not a lot of space so two of you can come forward.

1870
01:09:41,571 --> 01:09:42,611
We'll look.

1871
01:09:43,011 --> 01:09:44,541
He's here.

1872
01:09:44,811 --> 01:09:46,441
Please come in.

1873
01:09:46,441 --> 01:09:47,471
(They just hope it's not theirs.)

1874
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:48,911
Here he comes.

1875
01:09:48,911 --> 01:09:50,241
He's here.

1876
01:09:50,241 --> 01:09:53,111
- It's a red steel box. - You can take them out here.

1877
01:09:53,841 --> 01:09:56,041
What if it's tangsuyuk?

1878
01:09:56,041 --> 01:09:58,111
It's coming. He opened the lid.

1879
01:09:58,111 --> 01:10:01,841
(If it's Se Chan or Seok Jin's food, they'll go on the tour right away.)

1880
01:10:01,841 --> 01:10:05,441
(Which dish will come out first?)

1881
01:10:05,441 --> 01:10:06,571
He opened the lid.

1882
01:10:06,611 --> 01:10:07,841
It's jaengban jjajang.

1883
01:10:07,841 --> 01:10:09,471
- Jaengban jjajang is number one. - It's Kwang Soo's.

1884
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:10,541
(Kwang Soo is chosen.)

1885
01:10:10,711 --> 01:10:11,881
It's jaengban jjajang.

1886
01:10:11,881 --> 01:10:13,671
- It's jaengban jjajang. - Jaengban jjajang is number one.

1887
01:10:13,671 --> 01:10:16,141
(I think that was mine.)

1888
01:10:16,141 --> 01:10:18,311
- Stir-fried jjamppong is next. - That's second.

1889
01:10:18,741 --> 01:10:20,311
- Thank you. - Why isn't it tangsuyuk?

1890
01:10:20,311 --> 01:10:22,011
- Thank you, sir. - Excuse me.

1891
01:10:22,011 --> 01:10:24,111
- Don't you put it on the bottom? - Here comes jaengban jjajang.

1892
01:10:24,111 --> 01:10:25,241
Wait.

1893
01:10:25,411 --> 01:10:27,241
It's Kwang Soo!

1894
01:10:27,341 --> 01:10:29,041
Don't you usually put jaengban jjajang on the bottom?

1895
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:31,611
(Kwang Soo is back to his unlucky self again.)

1896
01:10:31,611 --> 01:10:32,611
- It's Kwang Soo. - Jaengban jjajang is number one.

1897
01:10:32,611 --> 01:10:34,541
Don't you usually put it on the bottom?

1898
01:10:35,141 --> 01:10:36,671
I'm so happy with it.

1899
01:10:36,671 --> 01:10:38,311
- Thank you, sir. - Doesn't it go on the bottom?

1900
01:10:38,311 --> 01:10:39,311
(Kwang Soo accumulates another Tour Sticker.)

1901
01:10:39,311 --> 01:10:40,771
Jaengban jjajang, it is.

1902
01:10:41,511 --> 01:10:42,611
You must receive a text message within 3 minutes...

1903
01:10:42,611 --> 01:10:45,171
that's longer than 10 syllables.

1904
01:10:45,171 --> 01:10:46,241
- That's the mission. - I got it.

1905
01:10:46,241 --> 01:10:48,671
- I got it too. - I got it from Ryu Hyun Jin.

1906
01:10:48,671 --> 01:10:50,841
- I got it from Hwang Je Seong. - I got so many.

1907
01:10:50,841 --> 01:10:52,941
Jae Seok, Seok Jin, and Kwang Soo are the losers.

1908
01:10:52,941 --> 01:10:54,241
- Are you serious? - You got nothing?

1909
01:10:54,241 --> 01:10:55,771
You think this is unfair?

1910
01:10:55,841 --> 01:10:58,311
Give me the roulette. There's something more important than this.

1911
01:10:59,041 --> 01:11:00,341
The Tour Sticker...

1912
01:11:00,711 --> 01:11:01,771
I can't lose, right?

1913
01:11:01,771 --> 01:11:03,971
If we get Kwang Soo, he'll surpass me again.

1914
01:11:03,971 --> 01:11:05,881
I hope it's 1 of you 2.

1915
01:11:06,011 --> 01:11:07,611
It usually lands on Kwang Soo.

1916
01:11:07,611 --> 01:11:10,341
No, that's not true. I didn't get the ice shower.

1917
01:11:10,541 --> 01:11:14,311
- Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, Jae Seok. - Kwang Soo.

1918
01:11:14,511 --> 01:11:16,841
- I have to write your name again. - That's not fair.

1919
01:11:16,841 --> 01:11:19,171
- I have to write your name again. - That's not fair.

1920
01:11:19,511 --> 01:11:20,511
It can't be helped.

1921
01:11:20,511 --> 01:11:21,571
(This wasn't intentional.)

1922
01:11:22,471 --> 01:11:24,241
- There should be a pass. - I did it in order.

1923
01:11:24,241 --> 01:11:26,411
How can my name be on there twice in a row?

1924
01:11:26,411 --> 01:11:28,711
Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, Jae Seok. Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, Jae Seok.

1925
01:11:28,711 --> 01:11:30,971
- Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, Jae Seok. - It could have been flipped.

1926
01:11:30,971 --> 01:11:33,341
Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, Jae Seok. Then it's you again.

1927
01:11:33,411 --> 01:11:34,881
So it's Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, and Jae Seok?

1928
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,641
Make it a dud.

1929
01:11:36,641 --> 01:11:38,771
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, and Jae Seok?

1930
01:11:38,771 --> 01:11:40,381
- Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, Jae Seok. - You have a chance.

1931
01:11:40,381 --> 01:11:43,071
Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, Jae Seok. And then...

1932
01:11:43,071 --> 01:11:44,341
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, and Jae Seok.

1933
01:11:45,241 --> 01:11:47,771
(So it's Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, and Jae Seok.)

1934
01:11:49,611 --> 01:11:50,881
(Why are you doing this to me?)

1935
01:11:50,881 --> 01:11:52,381
It's Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo, Seok Jin then Jae Seok.

1936
01:11:52,381 --> 01:11:53,771
It's Kwang Soo, Seok Jin then Jae Seok.

1937
01:11:53,771 --> 01:11:54,881
We can't do anything about it.

1938
01:11:54,881 --> 01:11:57,141
Fine. Let's do this then.

1939
01:11:57,141 --> 01:11:58,411
- There are six people. - Right.

1940
01:11:58,411 --> 01:11:59,841
This is different, right?

1941
01:12:00,241 --> 01:12:02,671
(He fills Kwang Soo's name in 2 spaces.)

1942
01:12:02,671 --> 01:12:04,211
- Hold on. - Right?

1943
01:12:04,211 --> 01:12:05,571
- Okay. - Are you happy?

1944
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:07,771
- Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, Jae Seok. - Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, Jae Seok.

1945
01:12:07,771 --> 01:12:09,211
(They explain the logic to Kwang Soo again.)

1946
01:12:09,211 --> 01:12:11,241
- Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, Jae Seok. - Kwang Soo!

1947
01:12:11,241 --> 01:12:13,111
(It's a big Kwang Soo.)

1948
01:12:13,111 --> 01:12:14,611
- Are you happy? - It's good.

1949
01:12:14,711 --> 01:12:15,811
- It's fine. - Let's go.

1950
01:12:15,811 --> 01:12:17,771
- You'll get lucky. - I'll overcome it.

1951
01:12:17,811 --> 01:12:18,841
What if he gets picked?

1952
01:12:18,841 --> 01:12:20,511
I'll do it. I'll overcome it.

1953
01:12:20,511 --> 01:12:22,311
- Should I spin it? - Okay.

1954
01:12:22,311 --> 01:12:23,741
- Go ahead. - Okay.

1955
01:12:23,741 --> 01:12:25,741
- He's good to go. - Here I come.

1956
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:27,571
- He's neutral. - If it's Seok Jin, he leaves.

1957
01:12:27,571 --> 01:12:28,811
- Please. - Jong Kook.

1958
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:29,941
If it's Seok Jin, he leaves right away?

1959
01:12:29,941 --> 01:12:31,241
If it's Jae Seok, he'll have two Tour Stickers.

1960
01:12:31,241 --> 01:12:32,611
- No! - I'll overcome it.

1961
01:12:32,971 --> 01:12:34,041
(The dangerous roulette has spun.)

1962
01:12:34,041 --> 01:12:35,171
It's Kwang Soo.

1963
01:12:35,241 --> 01:12:36,541
Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, Jae Seok.

1964
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:41,411
(If it lands on Seok Jin, he'll be the first person to go on the tour.)

1965
01:12:41,411 --> 01:12:43,841
(What will be their fates?)

1966
01:12:43,841 --> 01:12:44,841
It's Seok Jin.

1967
01:12:44,841 --> 01:12:45,881
(It lands on Seok Jin.)

1968
01:12:45,881 --> 01:12:47,971
- Really? It's over now. - Is it?

1969
01:12:48,381 --> 01:12:50,071
(Seok Jin is the 1st.)

1970
01:12:50,071 --> 01:12:52,311
- Really? It's over now. - Is it?

1971
01:12:52,941 --> 01:12:55,341
(He's the biggest coward.)

1972
01:12:55,341 --> 01:12:56,941
All of this in a day?

1973
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:00,011
(Seok Jin collapses.)

1974
01:13:00,411 --> 01:13:02,071
(Raging)

1975
01:13:02,071 --> 01:13:03,611
This can't be!

1976
01:13:03,611 --> 01:13:04,911
I think...

1977
01:13:05,211 --> 01:13:06,471
Is this possible?

1978
01:13:06,571 --> 01:13:08,471
- How is this possible? - Really?

1979
01:13:08,511 --> 01:13:09,911
This is not possible.

1980
01:13:09,911 --> 01:13:14,471
(He has three Tour Stickers.)

1981
01:13:14,471 --> 01:13:17,541
(2017 Running Man's Global Project)

1982
01:13:18,211 --> 01:13:22,881
(The world's deadliest tourist destinations rated by bloggers)

1983
01:13:22,881 --> 01:13:24,111
How is this possible?

1984
01:13:24,741 --> 01:13:26,041
This is impossible.

1985
01:13:26,041 --> 01:13:27,771
(Seok Jin is the first to go.)

1986
01:13:27,771 --> 01:13:30,211
This mission is called Dangerous Spoon.

1987
01:13:30,211 --> 01:13:31,841
Each member will flick the spoon...

1988
01:13:31,841 --> 01:13:33,381
one at a time and try to get it...

1989
01:13:33,381 --> 01:13:35,011
in the cup. That's the mission.

1990
01:13:35,111 --> 01:13:36,341
I'll go first.

1991
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:39,171
- If you get it in, you're our hero. - Challenge.

1992
01:13:39,471 --> 01:13:41,471
(I'm the hero.)

1993
01:13:41,881 --> 01:13:42,881
(Flicking)

1994
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:45,411
Okay. I failed.

1995
01:13:47,011 --> 01:13:48,771
So...

1996
01:13:48,771 --> 01:13:51,111
all of you fail.

1997
01:13:51,511 --> 01:13:53,711
- How is this possible? - This is really hard.

1998
01:13:53,711 --> 01:13:55,341
Is this even possible?

1999
01:13:55,341 --> 01:13:56,811
- The mission should be reasonable. - It's difficult.

2000
01:13:56,811 --> 01:13:58,241
- You're next. - This is impossible.

2001
01:13:58,341 --> 01:14:00,341
- No way. - It's you.

2002
01:14:00,341 --> 01:14:01,771
- It's you or Jae Seok. - Does it have to go in?

2003
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:06,211
(So Min, pick Jae Seok or Kwang Soo.)

2004
01:14:07,311 --> 01:14:08,471
Jae Seok?

2005
01:14:11,771 --> 01:14:12,971
(She says it right in front of him.)

2006
01:14:14,011 --> 01:14:15,911
- I think... - Jae Seok?

2007
01:14:16,381 --> 01:14:18,071
I think the chance of him going...

2008
01:14:18,311 --> 01:14:19,941
Why are you looking at me?

2009
01:14:20,711 --> 01:14:22,341
How is this even possible?

2010
01:14:22,811 --> 01:14:25,841
(That was too obvious, So Min.)

2011
01:14:26,211 --> 01:14:28,211
All right. The Whale Badge...

2012
01:14:28,211 --> 01:14:29,211
- goes to Jae Seok. - It's Kwang Soo.

2013
01:14:29,211 --> 01:14:30,241
Really?

2014
01:14:31,241 --> 01:14:33,241
- Why is it him? I'm curious. - It's you?

2015
01:14:33,241 --> 01:14:35,811
Why is it you? Do you have a clue?

2016
01:14:35,811 --> 01:14:37,311
(Jae Seok gets a Whale Badge.)

2017
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:39,381
This...

2018
01:14:39,381 --> 01:14:41,141
(They told me to look around,)

2019
01:14:41,141 --> 01:14:45,611
(and what I just saw was a bit strange.)

2020
01:14:47,311 --> 01:14:49,641
Do you know what you did?

2021
01:14:50,011 --> 01:14:51,541
- Try to think. - I think...

2022
01:14:51,541 --> 01:14:53,171
- I know. - Hold on. A little while ago...

2023
01:14:53,171 --> 01:14:54,381
I keep...

2024
01:14:55,381 --> 01:14:57,881
- I'm not sure if I'm right. - It can't be correct, right?

2025
01:14:57,881 --> 01:14:59,211
He can't get the No Tour Card.

2026
01:14:59,441 --> 01:15:01,041
I'm going to drink some water.

2027
01:15:01,041 --> 01:15:02,611
(What now?)

2028
01:15:02,611 --> 01:15:06,671
(Jae Seok seems to have caught on. Is this the end of Kook-Min's Pick?)

2029
01:15:07,611 --> 01:15:08,641
Are you asking for a favor?

2030
01:15:08,641 --> 01:15:09,911
- All right. - No, I...

2031
01:15:10,341 --> 01:15:11,841
As I have mentioned earlier,

2032
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:13,571
if you find out the hidden rule,

2033
01:15:13,571 --> 01:15:15,711
- you're free from all penalties. - All of them?

2034
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:17,171
- What about your Tour Stickers? - Not those, right?

2035
01:15:17,171 --> 01:15:18,171
- Not your Tour Stickers. - Not them?

2036
01:15:18,171 --> 01:15:19,241
It doesn't matter for you.

2037
01:15:19,241 --> 01:15:20,411
I won't get the Whale Badge.

2038
01:15:20,411 --> 01:15:24,841
(Did Jae Seok guess the hidden rule?)

2039
01:15:25,411 --> 01:15:27,011
- Jae Seok is correct. - Really?

2040
01:15:27,241 --> 01:15:29,071
(Jae Seok is correct.)

2041
01:15:29,771 --> 01:15:30,881
I'm right?

2042
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:34,811
Jong Kook and So Min...

2043
01:15:34,811 --> 01:15:36,971
are working on a mission together.

2044
01:15:37,141 --> 01:15:40,071
She said my name, and I got picked.

2045
01:15:40,311 --> 01:15:41,741
(He guessed the rule correctly.)

2046
01:15:41,741 --> 01:15:43,411
- Jae Seok is correct. - Really?

2047
01:15:43,411 --> 01:15:44,411
(Really?)

2048
01:15:44,411 --> 01:15:46,741
I'm right? Okay!

2049
01:15:46,741 --> 01:15:49,241
I'm right? Okay!

2050
01:15:49,241 --> 01:15:50,641
(Roaring)

2051
01:15:50,811 --> 01:15:52,141
It was you two, right?

2052
01:15:52,141 --> 01:15:54,911
(He calls them out.)

2053
01:15:54,911 --> 01:15:55,911
It was you two, right?

2054
01:15:55,911 --> 01:15:57,971
(What did he just say?)

2055
01:15:57,971 --> 01:16:00,241
(Did he just disclose everything?)

2056
01:16:00,241 --> 01:16:02,881
If three or more guess it right, you'll get the penalty.

2057
01:16:02,881 --> 01:16:04,711
- No way. - We can't.

2058
01:16:04,711 --> 01:16:06,971
Just be natural. Play the games.

2059
01:16:07,381 --> 01:16:08,671
It was you two, right?

2060
01:16:08,671 --> 01:16:10,241
- What is he doing? - It was them two.

2061
01:16:10,241 --> 01:16:12,441
(He's spoiling it for everybody.)

2062
01:16:12,441 --> 01:16:13,511
(What is he doing?)

2063
01:16:13,811 --> 01:16:15,671
- What are you doing? - What is he doing?

2064
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:16,881
What are you doing?

2065
01:16:17,211 --> 01:16:19,471
- What is he doing? - What's wrong with you?

2066
01:16:19,471 --> 01:16:20,611
(The staff members panic.)

2067
01:16:20,611 --> 01:16:21,941
- What is it? - You see...

2068
01:16:22,341 --> 01:16:24,341
I don't know what he's talking about.

2069
01:16:24,341 --> 01:16:25,381
Wait.

2070
01:16:25,381 --> 01:16:27,411
When missions are done,

2071
01:16:28,071 --> 01:16:31,571
Jong Kook and So Min...

2072
01:16:31,571 --> 01:16:32,911
(Haha finally catches on.)

2073
01:16:33,241 --> 01:16:34,971
- Haha is correct. - Okay.

2074
01:16:35,011 --> 01:16:37,711
Why did you ruin everything?

2075
01:16:37,711 --> 01:16:39,241
- I had no idea. - What?

2076
01:16:39,241 --> 01:16:41,071
He has to go on the tour.

2077
01:16:41,571 --> 01:16:43,411
He ruined everything.

2078
01:16:43,411 --> 01:16:44,611
What is it? I don't get it.

2079
01:16:44,611 --> 01:16:46,381
- He has to go. - I had no idea.

2080
01:16:46,641 --> 01:16:50,011
Was he accurate? Even the details?

2081
01:16:50,011 --> 01:16:51,541
He was very detailed.

2082
01:16:51,641 --> 01:16:53,071
- Jong Kook and So Min. - Even the details?

2083
01:16:53,071 --> 01:16:54,411
He doesn't know.

2084
01:16:54,411 --> 01:16:56,341
Jong Kook and So Min are the spies.

2085
01:16:57,071 --> 01:16:58,441
- They're the spies. - I had no idea.

2086
01:16:58,571 --> 01:17:01,111
- I had no idea. - Let me do this.

2087
01:17:01,171 --> 01:17:03,511
Jae Seok is correct.

2088
01:17:03,511 --> 01:17:06,711
Haha was 70 to 80 percent correct. He was close,

2089
01:17:06,711 --> 01:17:08,311
- so I'll give him that. - Okay!

2090
01:17:08,311 --> 01:17:10,011
- These two got it correct. - Really?

2091
01:17:10,041 --> 01:17:13,041
The rest of you have no clue,

2092
01:17:13,171 --> 01:17:14,841
so only those two will be exempted.

2093
01:17:14,841 --> 01:17:16,241
- Okay. - What is it?

2094
01:17:16,241 --> 01:17:17,381
(Jong Kook and So Min won't get Whale Badges either.)

2095
01:17:17,381 --> 01:17:19,711
The four of us got the mission correct.

2096
01:17:20,171 --> 01:17:22,411
So for now, Ji Hyo has no Whale Badge,

2097
01:17:22,411 --> 01:17:24,211
- and we each have one. - It'll be 2 out of 3.

2098
01:17:24,211 --> 01:17:25,541
The person without the Whale Badge can go.

2099
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:27,441
- Because... - So this is how it is.

2100
01:17:27,441 --> 01:17:29,711
- Ji Hyo, you have no Whale Badge. - Right.

2101
01:17:29,881 --> 01:17:31,611
- Come forward. - Why?

2102
01:17:31,611 --> 01:17:32,911
- You can't do that. - You can't do that.

2103
01:17:32,911 --> 01:17:36,671
I said the person with the most number of Whale Badges is the loser.

2104
01:17:36,671 --> 01:17:38,611
- I know it's right but... - Right.

2105
01:17:38,611 --> 01:17:40,741
Let go.

2106
01:17:41,071 --> 01:17:43,511
- Let go and talk. - "Let go."

2107
01:17:43,511 --> 01:17:46,441
- She can pick the person, right? - She can.

2108
01:17:46,441 --> 01:17:48,241
- She won't get the penalty. - She can pick one...

2109
01:17:48,241 --> 01:17:49,771
- but we have to pick the loser. - Wait.

2110
01:17:51,471 --> 01:17:53,611
I'm sick of picking.

2111
01:17:54,071 --> 01:17:55,311
I won't pick this time.

2112
01:17:55,611 --> 01:17:56,741
- He's intimidated. - One of us doesn't...

2113
01:17:56,741 --> 01:17:57,941
- Everyone stand back. - have to pick.

2114
01:17:58,071 --> 01:17:59,641
One of us doesn't have to go, right?

2115
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:02,441
Don't touch it. Just pick one.

2116
01:18:02,441 --> 01:18:05,341
The person who'll go on the whale-watching ferry tomorrow...

2117
01:18:05,341 --> 01:18:06,381
Do rock, paper, scissors.

2118
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:07,511
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

2119
01:18:07,511 --> 01:18:08,541
(They're betting their lives on it.)

2120
01:18:08,711 --> 01:18:09,711
- Okay. - Yes!

2121
01:18:09,711 --> 01:18:11,441
- Make sure you open it. - I got this.

2122
01:18:11,911 --> 01:18:13,611
- In one... We have no time. - I'm going crazy.

2123
01:18:13,611 --> 01:18:15,011
- Don't. Give me time. - One.

2124
01:18:15,071 --> 01:18:16,511
Whales, here I come.

2125
01:18:16,771 --> 01:18:18,411
In 12 hours,

2126
01:18:18,411 --> 01:18:20,511
(It takes 5 hours to get there. There isn't much time left.)

2127
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:22,111
- Let's go catch a whale - One.

2128
01:18:22,111 --> 01:18:23,541
- Bye, Kwang Soo. - No!

2129
01:18:23,941 --> 01:18:26,171
- 1, 2... - Please, Kwang Soo.

2130
01:18:26,771 --> 01:18:27,881
Please let it be him.

2131
01:18:27,881 --> 01:18:29,311
(Please don't get unlucky again.)

2132
01:18:30,141 --> 01:18:33,541
(Would Kwang Soo avoid the whales?)

2133
01:18:33,811 --> 01:18:34,881
- Kwang Soo. - Three.

2134
01:18:35,611 --> 01:18:36,741
Yes!

2135
01:18:36,741 --> 01:18:38,111
(There's no Whale Badge?)

2136
01:18:38,211 --> 01:18:39,241
- Goodness. - Yes!

2137
01:18:39,311 --> 01:18:41,041
(Kwang Soo survives.)

2138
01:18:41,041 --> 01:18:42,111
Se Chan is next.

2139
01:18:42,411 --> 01:18:43,911
You're next.

2140
01:18:43,971 --> 01:18:45,511
- He's the rising icon of bad luck. - Yes.

2141
01:18:45,711 --> 01:18:47,341
He's the super rookie bad luck.

2142
01:18:47,341 --> 01:18:48,711
He's the super rookie bad luck.

2143
01:18:48,711 --> 01:18:49,881
(This is a big match between new and old unlucky members.)

2144
01:18:49,881 --> 01:18:51,041
You can open it together.

2145
01:18:51,171 --> 01:18:53,171
Seok Jin, you can open it right after Se Chan.

2146
01:18:53,571 --> 01:18:55,381
- I'll pick this one. - All right.

2147
01:18:55,381 --> 01:18:58,141
If Kwang Soo gets picked to tag along...

2148
01:18:58,141 --> 01:19:00,141
(He'll be going to Ulsan if he gets picked to tag along.)

2149
01:19:00,141 --> 01:19:01,571
(Why would you mention that now?)

2150
01:19:01,571 --> 01:19:02,611
Get ready.

2151
01:19:02,611 --> 01:19:03,771
You know how it goes.

2152
01:19:03,771 --> 01:19:05,611
- Ready. - 1, 2...

2153
01:19:05,771 --> 01:19:08,941
(In 12 hours, 1 person will be standing by the sea in Ulsan.)

2154
01:19:08,941 --> 01:19:11,671
(This is a close match between the unluckiest members.)

2155
01:19:11,671 --> 01:19:13,241
(Who's the unluckiest one between them?)

2156
01:19:13,241 --> 01:19:14,411
Three.

2157
01:19:14,411 --> 01:19:17,511
(It's Seok Jin.)

2158
01:19:19,381 --> 01:19:21,071
(He's impossible to beat.)

2159
01:19:21,071 --> 01:19:22,141
I got lucky.

2160
01:19:23,641 --> 01:19:25,111
(He got 3 Tour Stickers, and he gets to go on whale-watching ferry.)

2161
01:19:25,111 --> 01:19:28,011
- This is insane. - He's going on the tour too.

2162
01:19:28,241 --> 01:19:29,541
- He's going on the tour... - He's definitely...

2163
01:19:29,541 --> 01:19:31,211
- and the whale-watching ferry. - excited today.

2164
01:19:31,911 --> 01:19:33,741
(This is his unluckiest day of all.)

2165
01:19:33,841 --> 01:19:35,511
Seok Jin...

2166
01:19:35,511 --> 01:19:40,411
can take one person out of Kwang Soo, Se Chan and Ji Hyo.

2167
01:19:40,671 --> 01:19:43,311
Seok Jin will give the Whale Badge to one person.

2168
01:19:44,041 --> 01:19:45,341
Why aren't you looking at him,

2169
01:19:45,341 --> 01:19:46,571
- Kwang Soo? - Pardon?

2170
01:19:47,141 --> 01:19:49,541
- It's not me. - Why aren't you looking at me?

2171
01:19:49,541 --> 01:19:52,241
I feel bad for Se Chan. You even got your house taken away.

2172
01:19:52,241 --> 01:19:53,771
- I gave everything I have. - Gosh.

2173
01:19:54,241 --> 01:19:56,441
(Hold on. Who shall I go with?)

2174
01:19:56,511 --> 01:19:59,611
(Should I pick Se Chan because he annoyed me all day?)

2175
01:19:59,881 --> 01:20:02,841
(He was being annoying.)

2176
01:20:04,011 --> 01:20:06,441
(Or should I pick Ji Hyo because she was being curt?)

2177
01:20:07,011 --> 01:20:10,741
(Can you let go of my hand?)

2178
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:14,511
(Or should I pick Kwang Soo because he's always nasty?)

2179
01:20:14,511 --> 01:20:16,041
(Stop bothering me.)

2180
01:20:16,771 --> 01:20:20,641
(He always talks so much whenever I'm being made fun of.)

2181
01:20:21,241 --> 01:20:22,511
- I gave everything I have. - Gosh.

2182
01:20:22,541 --> 01:20:23,941
I'm going on the tour for sure, right?

2183
01:20:23,941 --> 01:20:25,611
- Yes. - You are.

2184
01:20:25,771 --> 01:20:27,711
You're going to Japan and the whale-watching ferry.

2185
01:20:28,771 --> 01:20:31,381
(There's nothing to be confused about.)

2186
01:20:31,471 --> 01:20:33,071
What did you say?

2187
01:20:33,071 --> 01:20:35,311
(Do you want to go too?)

2188
01:20:35,941 --> 01:20:37,571
Seok Jin.

2189
01:20:37,571 --> 01:20:38,881
He didn't clip it on yet.

2190
01:20:38,881 --> 01:20:41,511
- He didn't clip it on yet. - He's not supposed to do it.

2191
01:20:41,511 --> 01:20:42,641
(Kissing)

2192
01:20:42,941 --> 01:20:45,971
(I'll only take your kindness.)

2193
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:47,941
Rip your shirt.

2194
01:20:48,541 --> 01:20:50,111
- If he clips it on, it's over. - Seok Jin.

2195
01:20:50,111 --> 01:20:51,611
(Are you being serious?)

2196
01:20:52,211 --> 01:20:54,541
(He didn't filter out his choice of words.)

2197
01:20:54,541 --> 01:20:56,071
It's Kwang Soo.

2198
01:20:56,071 --> 01:20:57,211
(He gets the badge.)

2199
01:20:57,211 --> 01:20:59,011
It's Kwang Soo and Seok Jin.

2200
01:20:59,511 --> 01:21:00,741
They'll be heading to the seas of Ulsan.

2201
01:21:00,741 --> 01:21:02,241
- Go! - Go!

2202
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:04,011
You would have picked me too.

2203
01:21:04,241 --> 01:21:06,511
This concludes today's missions.

2204
01:21:06,511 --> 01:21:10,511
Seok Jin and Kwang Soo will be going on the whale-watching ferry.

2205
01:21:10,511 --> 01:21:12,671
- That's the final decision. - This is our day.

2206
01:21:12,671 --> 01:21:13,941
(He's going out of his mind.)

2207
01:21:14,171 --> 01:21:16,071
- Feel-Chok cross! - Feel-Chok cross!

2208
01:21:16,381 --> 01:21:18,741
I get to on the tour and watch the whales as well.

2209
01:21:18,741 --> 01:21:22,381
If you don't see the whales, Kwang Soo gets a Tour Sticker.

2210
01:21:23,041 --> 01:21:25,311
- Wait. If we don't see the whales? - Okay. Please.

2211
01:21:25,311 --> 01:21:26,511
Hide, whales.

2212
01:21:26,511 --> 01:21:28,241
- I've never seen whales in my life. - Hide, whales.

2213
01:21:28,571 --> 01:21:30,211
Is it possible to see them?

2214
01:21:30,211 --> 01:21:31,911
I said it before. There's 20 percent chance.

2215
01:21:31,911 --> 01:21:33,671
- Have you seen whales before? - No.

2216
01:21:33,671 --> 01:21:34,741
Are there whales in Korea?

2217
01:21:34,741 --> 01:21:37,411
- This is our king. - It's the king.

2218
01:21:37,411 --> 01:21:38,841
- Let's worship him. - Let's worship him.

2219
01:21:38,841 --> 01:21:40,471
- Let's worship Kwang Soo. - Let's worship him.

2220
01:21:41,241 --> 01:21:44,171
I'll be trapped inside for three hours, and if I don't see a whale,

2221
01:21:45,011 --> 01:21:49,411
I'll be dropped from the sky or get haunted by a ghost?

2222
01:21:50,111 --> 01:21:51,471
- This is a true story. - This is a true story.

2223
01:21:51,471 --> 01:21:53,171
I'm going to make sure I see it.

2224
01:21:53,171 --> 01:21:55,011
(Would they be able to avoid the tour?)

2225
01:21:56,241 --> 01:21:59,841
(Next day 5am in Jangsaengpo, Ulsan)

2226
01:22:03,441 --> 01:22:04,571
Good morning.

2227
01:22:04,571 --> 01:22:05,811
(He's exhausted.)

2228
01:22:05,811 --> 01:22:07,641
I can't stop laughing.

2229
01:22:08,141 --> 01:22:09,811
What time is it right now?

2230
01:22:10,141 --> 01:22:11,511
It's 5am.

2231
01:22:11,511 --> 01:22:14,311
(It took five hours from Seoul to get here.)

2232
01:22:15,141 --> 01:22:16,241
Hurry up.

2233
01:22:16,341 --> 01:22:17,341
(Kwang Soo looks annoyed.)

2234
01:22:18,171 --> 01:22:19,811
Hello. Hi.

2235
01:22:20,741 --> 01:22:22,471
Kwang Soo didn't do anything wrong.

2236
01:22:22,941 --> 01:22:24,241
I dragged you here.

2237
01:22:24,241 --> 01:22:28,671
Seok Jin, you have three Tour Stickers...

2238
01:22:28,741 --> 01:22:30,471
and Kwang Soo, you have two.

2239
01:22:30,941 --> 01:22:32,341
If you think about it,

2240
01:22:32,611 --> 01:22:34,881
- I'm here because of you... - I'm sorry.

2241
01:22:34,881 --> 01:22:37,911
and if I don't see the whales, I might go on the tour because of you.

2242
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:39,211
You ruined my life.

2243
01:22:39,211 --> 01:22:40,881
Hey, we have to see the whales.

2244
01:22:40,881 --> 01:22:41,911
- Did you hear? - What?

2245
01:22:41,911 --> 01:22:43,171
You can see them 2 out of 10 times.

2246
01:22:43,881 --> 01:22:46,611
I've never seen any whales since I've watched "Free Willy" as a kid.

2247
01:22:47,511 --> 01:22:48,911
Drink it.

2248
01:22:49,511 --> 01:22:50,841
Let's go. Let's see it.

2249
01:22:50,971 --> 01:22:53,141
- I hope we can see it. - I really want to see it.

2250
01:22:53,941 --> 01:22:56,141
- Hello. - Hello.

2251
01:22:56,211 --> 01:22:57,841
If you go out to the sea, do you usually see them?

2252
01:22:58,381 --> 01:23:01,571
We don't actually see them too often.

2253
01:23:01,911 --> 01:23:03,241
You need luck.

2254
01:23:03,571 --> 01:23:05,511
(We need luck?)

2255
01:23:05,511 --> 01:23:06,641
We have no luck.

2256
01:23:06,641 --> 01:23:08,611
How recent was the last time you saw one?

2257
01:23:08,611 --> 01:23:10,841
- She saw one. - It was April 12.

2258
01:23:10,841 --> 01:23:12,111
- On April 12? - Yes.

2259
01:23:12,941 --> 01:23:15,811
- They remember the exact date... - Hey.

2260
01:23:15,811 --> 01:23:17,171
because it's precious to them.

2261
01:23:17,541 --> 01:23:19,171
They sail out every day...

2262
01:23:19,511 --> 01:23:22,771
- but it's meaningful to them too. - Why would you say that?

2263
01:23:23,941 --> 01:23:26,611
- Let's get on. - My gosh.

2264
01:23:26,741 --> 01:23:29,381
- Whales... - This is so big.

2265
01:23:29,571 --> 01:23:32,041
- Isn't this like a movie? - It's huge.

2266
01:23:32,041 --> 01:23:35,311
- There's an observatory here. - Second floor is nice too.

2267
01:23:35,611 --> 01:23:37,541
Imagine seeing a whale.

2268
01:23:37,541 --> 01:23:39,411
- It'll be right in front of us. - It'll be here.

2269
01:23:39,411 --> 01:23:41,471
They'll be here right in front of us.

2270
01:23:42,111 --> 01:23:44,511
- It'll be no joke. - It feels so unrealistic.

2271
01:23:44,841 --> 01:23:45,971
Whales, please...

2272
01:23:45,971 --> 01:23:47,471
(I'm quite serious today, whales.)

2273
01:23:47,471 --> 01:23:48,571
We have to see one today.

2274
01:23:49,211 --> 01:23:51,811
(The ferry takes three hours. It heads out to see the whales.)

2275
01:23:51,811 --> 01:23:53,541
- You haven't had breakfast, right? - No.

2276
01:23:53,541 --> 01:23:54,741
- Would you like some noodles? - Give us some food.

2277
01:23:54,741 --> 01:23:56,841
- Really? - They taste great on ferries.

2278
01:23:56,841 --> 01:23:58,071
They taste great.

2279
01:23:58,641 --> 01:24:00,911
- Can I have one? - I was hoping for one.

2280
01:24:01,011 --> 01:24:02,741
I did think about it earlier.

2281
01:24:03,011 --> 01:24:06,141
- It tastes the best. - It tastes great on ferries.

2282
01:24:07,971 --> 01:24:10,211
(They gobble it down.)

2283
01:24:15,141 --> 01:24:16,471
(It's amazing.)

2284
01:24:17,441 --> 01:24:18,971
It's so good.

2285
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:20,241
It's so good.

2286
01:24:20,241 --> 01:24:22,141
(They're happy with just noodles.)

2287
01:24:22,141 --> 01:24:23,771
This will be a happy ending only if we see the whales.

2288
01:24:25,041 --> 01:24:26,111
Then,

2289
01:24:26,341 --> 01:24:29,771
if we see a large 20m whale,

2290
01:24:29,771 --> 01:24:31,541
can you take a Tour Sticker from us?

2291
01:24:31,941 --> 01:24:33,811
You can do that.

2292
01:24:34,111 --> 01:24:35,711
- Of course you can. - How many people do you think...

2293
01:24:35,711 --> 01:24:38,611
- saw a 20m whale in Korea? - You can see it every few years.

2294
01:24:38,611 --> 01:24:39,711
It'll be a miracle.

2295
01:24:40,141 --> 01:24:42,311
- It's impossible. - If you see a 20m whale,

2296
01:24:42,311 --> 01:24:43,441
it's still 3 and 2.

2297
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:45,141
(That's the producer's answer.)

2298
01:24:45,941 --> 01:24:47,241
What about 50m?

2299
01:24:47,881 --> 01:24:49,241
If it's 50m, we'll take it off.

2300
01:24:49,241 --> 01:24:50,541
It can also be three 20m whales.

2301
01:24:51,441 --> 01:24:53,771
(Why does it feel like this negotiation is a fail?)

2302
01:24:54,211 --> 01:24:56,811
It's the size of this ferry?

2303
01:24:58,171 --> 01:25:00,141
- 3 of them. - 3 of them.

2304
01:25:00,241 --> 01:25:03,641
- What about a 10m whale jumps... - Your Tour Stickers...

2305
01:25:03,641 --> 01:25:05,041
and makes a heart with its fins?

2306
01:25:06,041 --> 01:25:07,311
- Like this? - Yes, like this.

2307
01:25:08,471 --> 01:25:10,441
Let's do this. We'll divide it up.

2308
01:25:10,511 --> 01:25:13,411
If we see a 50m whale, we'll take Seok Jin's sticker away.

2309
01:25:13,411 --> 01:25:15,611
If we see 3 20m whales, we'll take Kwang Soo's away.

2310
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:17,381
- You're going to divide it up. - Yes.

2311
01:25:17,711 --> 01:25:21,171
Do you know how rare the chances are? Why would you divide it up?

2312
01:25:21,171 --> 01:25:23,441
- You should just give it to us. - You're so cruel.

2313
01:25:23,441 --> 01:25:24,771
Is this necessary?

2314
01:25:24,771 --> 01:25:27,841
- Did you see him giggle? - Do you think they can do this?

2315
01:25:27,841 --> 01:25:29,541
- Come on. - Is that even possible?

2316
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:33,381
There's a chance we'll see a 50m whale. Who wants to take that one?

2317
01:25:34,211 --> 01:25:36,841
- Me. Please. - I'll take it.

2318
01:25:36,841 --> 01:25:38,171
I got dragged here.

2319
01:25:38,171 --> 01:25:41,041
- Me. - I suggested it. I'll take it.

2320
01:25:41,041 --> 01:25:42,311
Please put your hands down.

2321
01:25:43,011 --> 01:25:44,111
Who wants to take the 50m whale?

2322
01:25:44,111 --> 01:25:45,741
- Me. - Me. I was faster.

2323
01:25:45,741 --> 01:25:47,811
- Me. He didn't say anything. - I stood up.

2324
01:25:47,811 --> 01:25:49,771
- Sir. - It's Kwang Soo.

2325
01:25:49,771 --> 01:25:51,641
- Okay. 50m whale? - What's your standard?

2326
01:25:51,641 --> 01:25:53,071
He was faster.

2327
01:25:53,071 --> 01:25:55,041
- I stood up. - Kwang Soo gets the 50m whale.

2328
01:25:55,041 --> 01:25:58,671
- It's three 20m whales for me? - I'll give you that.

2329
01:25:58,811 --> 01:26:00,171
- You'll take away a Tour Sticker? - I will.

2330
01:26:00,171 --> 01:26:01,171
(They're going beyond Guinness World Records.)

2331
01:26:01,171 --> 01:26:02,311
I'll show you.

2332
01:26:03,971 --> 01:26:05,881
(30 minutes later)

2333
01:26:05,881 --> 01:26:07,471
(An hour later)

2334
01:26:07,471 --> 01:26:09,341
(An hour and a half later)

2335
01:26:10,771 --> 01:26:15,041
(They must sail back in 30 minutes.)

2336
01:26:15,041 --> 01:26:16,641
I have a bad feeling about this.

2337
01:26:18,111 --> 01:26:19,211
Gosh.

2338
01:26:19,211 --> 01:26:23,241
(If they don't see whales, they'll see sharks,)

2339
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:28,381
(ghosts or crocodiles.)

2340
01:26:28,971 --> 01:26:30,471
What if we can't see them?

2341
01:26:30,911 --> 01:26:33,041
(Where are you, whales?)

2342
01:26:35,571 --> 01:26:36,711
This...

2343
01:26:36,711 --> 01:26:41,071
This is an announcement.

2344
01:26:41,771 --> 01:26:45,371
There's a pod of whales on in the front of the ferry.

2345
01:26:45,371 --> 01:26:46,371
Where?

2346
01:26:46,371 --> 01:26:49,771
(There's a pod of whales?)

2347
01:26:50,811 --> 01:26:52,641
- Let me repeat. - Where?

2348
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:55,141
- Where? - Where?

2349
01:26:56,111 --> 01:26:58,811
Do you see the fishing boat? They are near that boat.

2350
01:27:00,941 --> 01:27:02,041
I see them.

2351
01:27:02,441 --> 01:27:03,971
There they are!

2352
01:27:05,541 --> 01:27:10,571
(There's a whale in front of them.)

2353
01:27:10,671 --> 01:27:12,511
It's a whale!

2354
01:27:12,741 --> 01:27:15,341
- It's jumping. - It's jumping.

2355
01:27:15,341 --> 01:27:17,611
- It's coming here. - I see it.

2356
01:27:17,611 --> 01:27:19,741
- I see it. This is awesome. - It's coming.

2357
01:27:19,741 --> 01:27:21,571
- Over there. - You see it, right?

2358
01:27:21,711 --> 01:27:22,741
Sir.

2359
01:27:22,741 --> 01:27:25,141
- There are about 500 of them. - Look at that.

2360
01:27:25,141 --> 01:27:26,141
No!

2361
01:27:26,141 --> 01:27:28,241
There are 6,000 of them.

2362
01:27:28,241 --> 01:27:30,071
No. Look at that!

2363
01:27:30,071 --> 01:27:31,811
Hey!

2364
01:27:31,811 --> 01:27:32,971
(Thrilled)

2365
01:27:33,441 --> 01:27:35,711
- Guys! - Move ship backward!

2366
01:27:35,871 --> 01:27:37,411
- Look! - Move ship backward!

2367
01:27:37,641 --> 01:27:40,341
- They're whales. - This is unbelievable.

2368
01:27:41,671 --> 01:27:43,011
- Look at that. - Guys.

2369
01:27:43,011 --> 01:27:44,811
(They can't believe what's in front of their eyes.)

2370
01:27:47,571 --> 01:27:48,971
My camera can't capture them.

2371
01:27:49,441 --> 01:27:51,241
(The scene is breathtaking.)

2372
01:27:51,241 --> 01:27:52,641
Look at that.

2373
01:27:52,641 --> 01:27:54,341
- This is crazy. - I can't believe this.

2374
01:27:54,341 --> 01:27:55,471
(They approach the ship.)

2375
01:27:55,471 --> 01:27:57,341
Look at that.

2376
01:27:57,911 --> 01:28:00,841
- Please stop the ship! - The whales are here.

2377
01:28:01,341 --> 01:28:04,241
- This is amazing. - This is not computer graphics.

2378
01:28:04,341 --> 01:28:05,711
This is not computer graphics.

2379
01:28:05,911 --> 01:28:08,571
This is unbelievable. Look at that.

2380
01:28:09,111 --> 01:28:11,541
(They're awed by the nature.)

2381
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:13,941
- They're so close. - This is amazing.

2382
01:28:13,941 --> 01:28:18,141
- This might seem unreal... - The whales are dancing.

2383
01:28:18,141 --> 01:28:20,111
You have to film them.

2384
01:28:20,141 --> 01:28:23,671
- Film the whales. - You don't have to film me.

2385
01:28:23,811 --> 01:28:26,611
If I jump off the ship now, I'd land on a whale's back.

2386
01:28:26,911 --> 01:28:28,611
They're that close.

2387
01:28:28,911 --> 01:28:30,741
- Where are they? - Guys.

2388
01:28:30,741 --> 01:28:31,741
- They're right here. - Where?

2389
01:28:31,741 --> 01:28:32,941
(They can't contain the excitement.)

2390
01:28:33,241 --> 01:28:35,111
- The whales are following us. - They're following us.

2391
01:28:35,241 --> 01:28:37,971
- This is so exciting. - Guys.

2392
01:28:37,971 --> 01:28:40,041
I'll go to the other side of the ship.

2393
01:28:40,571 --> 01:28:41,641
Guys.

2394
01:28:41,741 --> 01:28:44,511
(Kwang Soo bumps into a chair.)

2395
01:28:45,371 --> 01:28:47,941
(He was blinded by the excitement.)

2396
01:28:47,941 --> 01:28:49,641
I'm okay.

2397
01:28:49,641 --> 01:28:51,641
Don't film me, film the whales.

2398
01:28:51,941 --> 01:28:54,641
(He's giving up the camera for the whales.)

2399
01:28:54,641 --> 01:28:56,711
Don't film me. I'm okay.

2400
01:28:56,711 --> 01:28:57,971
(Leave me here.)

2401
01:28:58,911 --> 01:29:00,171
Look at that!

2402
01:29:00,171 --> 01:29:02,341
(They're excited at the whale's dance.)

2403
01:29:02,871 --> 01:29:05,611
This is a breathtaking scene.

2404
01:29:05,611 --> 01:29:07,211
This is real.

2405
01:29:07,741 --> 01:29:11,371
We have to go back to the port now.

2406
01:29:11,371 --> 01:29:13,441
We're turning the ship.

2407
01:29:13,441 --> 01:29:15,371
- What are you talking about? - What?

2408
01:29:15,371 --> 01:29:16,371
(Are we going back?)

2409
01:29:16,641 --> 01:29:18,871
We can't!

2410
01:29:18,871 --> 01:29:20,841
(They have to say goodbye to the whales.)

2411
01:29:21,111 --> 01:29:23,571
I was a whale in my past life.

2412
01:29:23,841 --> 01:29:26,441
Leave me here. My family is here.

2413
01:29:26,441 --> 01:29:29,441
- Calm down. - My family is here.

2414
01:29:29,441 --> 01:29:31,441
- Calm down. - I can't.

2415
01:29:31,441 --> 01:29:32,741
(Kwang Soo, we're waiting for you.)

2416
01:29:33,071 --> 01:29:35,241
- Everyone. - Are your knees okay?

2417
01:29:35,241 --> 01:29:37,011
(I'm a whale.)

2418
01:29:37,011 --> 01:29:38,711
My jacket has the whale color.

2419
01:29:39,111 --> 01:29:41,841
(He's sending ultrasonic waves to his family.)

2420
01:29:42,871 --> 01:29:44,371
(My family and friends,)

2421
01:29:44,371 --> 01:29:46,611
(can you hear me?)

2422
01:29:47,041 --> 01:29:49,071
Kwang Soo, calm down.

2423
01:29:49,071 --> 01:29:51,611
- Well... - Yes.

2424
01:29:51,611 --> 01:29:53,041
Seok Jin and Kwang Soo...

2425
01:29:53,941 --> 01:29:57,341
succeeded in spotting whales, which happens only 20 percent of the time.

2426
01:29:57,341 --> 01:29:59,441
(Kwang Soo and Seok Jin completed the whale-watching mission.)

2427
01:30:00,071 --> 01:30:03,341
- Thank you, Kwang Soo. - My pleasure.

2428
01:30:03,341 --> 01:30:05,111
- Whale! - Whale!

2429
01:30:05,111 --> 01:30:06,241
(We love you, whales.)

2430
01:30:06,241 --> 01:30:09,471
- You'll be given a No Tour Card... - Give us five dollars.

2431
01:30:10,441 --> 01:30:11,511
and...

2432
01:30:12,871 --> 01:30:15,141
(The whale mission is not over yet.)

2433
01:30:15,141 --> 01:30:17,211
(This is only the beginning.)

2434
01:30:17,641 --> 01:30:19,141
(Next week)

2435
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:22,011
(Another mission is given.)

2436
01:30:22,011 --> 01:30:23,911
(What is the secret behind the whale-watching tour?)

2437
01:30:24,211 --> 01:30:25,211
(And)

2438
01:30:25,911 --> 01:30:27,711
(Dangerous Tourist Attractions)

2439
01:30:27,711 --> 01:30:28,811
(Global Race)

2440
01:30:29,471 --> 01:30:31,611
(Who will be sent to the Dangerous Tourist Attraction?)

2441
01:30:31,611 --> 01:30:34,971
(The final competition to avoid the dangerous trip)

2442
01:30:36,111 --> 01:30:38,241
(Avoid the dangerous trip if you can.)

2443
01:30:38,241 --> 01:30:39,641
(It's unpredictable.)

2444
01:30:39,641 --> 01:30:42,171
(The result is unexpected.)

2445
01:30:42,171 --> 01:30:44,741
(Soon)

2446
01:30:44,741 --> 01:30:47,541
(The destination will be determined.)

2447
01:30:47,811 --> 01:30:49,941
(Running Man's Global Project coming soon)
