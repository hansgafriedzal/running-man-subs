(Buy Tour Stickers and Reflecting Cards at the Store of Fate.)

18
00:00:58,419 --> 00:01:00,619
(Tour Stickers or Reflecting Cards?)

19
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:02,889
(How will this end?)

20
00:01:04,249 --> 00:01:06,789
(They're on their way to the Store of Fate.)

21
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:09,019
After watching the show, my mom told me...

22
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:11,789
not to behave like I do at home.

23
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:13,989
(Her mom told her not to behave like she does at home.)

24
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:16,489
She said I give others trouble.

25
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,489
Do you give your mother trouble too?

26
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:20,419
- Yes. - Really?

27
00:01:20,419 --> 00:01:22,619
(They didn't know...)

28
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,419
(how much trouble So Min was about to give them.)

29
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:31,719
All right. You can purchase the cards at the Store of Fate now.

30
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,219
We buy them first?

31
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:38,689
(It's been decided that Seok Jin and Se Chan are going on the trip.)

32
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,289
(They can buy Tour Stickers and Reflecting Cards with mission fees.)

33
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:44,549
I want a Tour Sticker.

34
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:45,819
Thank you.

35
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,519
(Haha buys a Tour Sticker for 50 dollars.)

36
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:49,449
Please give me a Tour Sticker.

37
00:01:49,449 --> 00:01:51,049
(Jong Kook buys a Tour Sticker too.)

38
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,789
So Min.

39
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:53,989
(By earning 200 dollars, Jae Seok is the richest member.)

40
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:57,789
Jae Seok could send two people on the trip.

41
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,189
I'm still thinking.

42
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:02,149
So Min, think carefully.

43
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:03,149
See you in a while.

44
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,919
(3 Tour Stickers, or 1 Reflecting Card and 1 Tour Sticker?)

45
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:06,719
I prefer being unhappy together...

46
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,919
than being happy alone.

47
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,189
(I prefer being unhappy together.)

48
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:13,219
- Gosh, you're... - You're unbelievable.

49
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:15,789
You're so...

50
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:17,789
(What will So Min choose?)

51
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:20,219
I want to shout from the top of a mountain.

52
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:21,319
- Shout what? - What?

53
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,289
So Min is crazy!

54
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:25,049
(So Min is very crazy!)

55
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:27,189
(Wait and see.)

56
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:29,989
(Glancing)

57
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:34,289
(What is she buying with a smile on her face?)

58
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:35,519
(So Min's purchase is done.)

59
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,819
- How many did you buy? - How many did you buy?

60
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:38,519
- Is it a secret? - Yes.

61
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,219
Everyone's done purchasing, right?

62
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:42,519
I'm not.

63
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,519
(I'm not done yet.)

64
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:51,049
(Jae Seok accidentally won the Dangerous Shoe Throw.)

65
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:54,119
(Did I just win?)

66
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:58,019
(He can get either 4 Tour Stickers or 2 Reflecting Cards.)

67
00:02:58,019 --> 00:02:59,219
The man of the day.

68
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,289
- Jae Seok, go ahead. - Go ahead.

69
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:03,149
(It's the richest member's turn.)

70
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,619
I trust you, Jae Seok.

71
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:11,349
Let's be unhappy together.

72
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,019
With this money,

73
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,819
I can even send someone who has no Stickers at all.

74
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:19,289
(He can send someone who has nothing.)

75
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:21,249
In addition to that, I could send Kwang Soo too.

76
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:22,249
(Global Race)

77
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:23,789
Please don't.

78
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:25,119
Do you understand?

79
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:27,419
(Jae Seok's purchase...)

80
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:31,789
(will determine everyone's fate.)

81
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:38,189
(A Tour Sticker costs 50 dollars, and a Reflecting Card costs 100.)

82
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:42,449
(Defend with Reflecting Cards or attack with Tour Stickers?)

83
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:44,489
Should I get Reflecting Cards?

84
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:50,219
(I should be careful. I could be counter-attacked.)

85
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,519
(Reflecting Cards will keep him safe...)

86
00:03:54,919 --> 00:04:00,049
(while Tour Stickers can get everyone in trouble.)

87
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:06,619
(After a long pondering, what will Jae Seok choose?)

88
00:04:06,649 --> 00:04:07,649
Please.

89
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:12,789
(All 4 members with money have made purchases.)

90
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:14,889
All right.

91
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:16,249
Let's decide the attacking order now.

92
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:19,619
The attacking order is important.

93
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,089
Ladies first.

94
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,519
Go ahead.

95
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,219
(This attack will...)

96
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:27,689
(determine who will be sent on the trip.)

97
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:30,789
Can we save the Reflecting Cards for later?

98
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:33,219
No, you can't.

99
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,619
Everyone will find out who has them.

100
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:37,719
If your turn comes early...

101
00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:39,889
- It's useless. - So you have to...

102
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:41,289
How many times do we have to tell you?

103
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,819
(What?)

104
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:47,689
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

105
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,719
- Who's number one? - Who is it?

106
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:52,019
- Who's number one? - Who is it?

107
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:53,289
(It's a war of nerves.)

108
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:57,519
(Number 1 won't be able to use their Reflecting Cards.)

109
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,349
Let's check. It's So Min.

110
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:04,389
(So Min goes first.)

111
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:05,889
So Min is number one.

112
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,419
(Then my strategy should be...)

113
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:14,789
(As long as we're together, I don't mind misfortunes.)

114
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:18,349
(3 Tour Stickers, or 1 Reflecting Card and 2 Tour Stickers?)

115
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:20,249
So Min goes first. What did you buy?

116
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:21,289
What did you buy?

117
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:22,789
(3 Tour Stickers, or 1 Reflecting Card and 2 Tour Stickers?)

118
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,019
She bought three.

119
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:26,249
(So Min got 3 Tour Stickers.)

120
00:05:26,249 --> 00:05:30,819
(So Min has 3 Tour Stickers.)

121
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:32,549
You bought three Tour Stickers?

122
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:34,789
You want to be unhappy together.

123
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:36,719
That's what I want.

124
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:39,119
- Great job. - So Min.

125
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:41,519
Number one.

126
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,089
- So Min. - In my opinion,

127
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:46,619
a Reflecting Card can take away only one Sticker, right?

128
00:05:46,619 --> 00:05:48,089
- Yes. - Then...

129
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:52,789
(If that's what a Reflecting Card can do...)

130
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:56,319
I think Jae Seok has Reflecting Cards.

131
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,019
So...

132
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:01,789
if I give him three Tour Stickers...

133
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:04,819
(Tour Stickers)

134
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:06,619
- Wait. - She's so scary.

135
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:08,249
She's crazy.

136
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,719
She's lost her mind.

137
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:13,189
So Min, you're the best.

138
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:15,219
- Why would you do that? - I'm so surprised.

139
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:18,189
That's my plan number one.

140
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:21,819
- Plan number two is this. - Is it Kwang Soo?

141
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:22,819
Is it Kwang Soo?

142
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:24,819
(Her second plan is sending Haha and Kwang Soo.)

143
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:27,019
Plan number three is...

144
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,289
like this.

145
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,619
(She can send Jong Kook and Kwang Soo too.)

146
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:32,289
- Me? - So Min.

147
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:34,319
Why am I included in both plans?

148
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,889
If Haha can promise me...

149
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:38,519
- If he can promise me, - Okay.

150
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:42,119
then here and...

151
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:44,319
As soon as you put one here, we'll be one.

152
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,449
(Let's attack Jae Seok together. We'll be one.)

153
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:49,119
If you attack Jae Seok, we'll all help you.

154
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:50,649
What are you talking about?

155
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:52,719
If Haha can promise me, even if Jae Seok uses a Reflecting Card,

156
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:54,619
Haha will attack him again. Then I can attack Kwang Soo too.

157
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:56,819
- Deal. - Wait.

158
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,149
Look. So Min, look at this.

159
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,189
It's been too long since Haha got his last Tour Sticker.

160
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,519
Send him away.

161
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:06,049
- So Min, I promise you. - Send him away.

162
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:08,619
- I promise you. Trust me. - Fine.

163
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:10,019
It's fun and unexpected.

164
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:13,849
Let's keep our backs turned. Come here. My gosh.

165
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:18,719
So Min will make a decision on her own now.

166
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:20,449
Please put your Stickers on the board.

167
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:21,919
She's crazy.

168
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,319
I don't know what So Min wants.

169
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,089
What if I put one here?

170
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:28,419
I have to put two here no matter what.

171
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:31,819
(Whom did So Min pick?)

172
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,119
It's impossible to know what she's thinking.

173
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:38,119
(So Min makes her decision.)

174
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:41,389
Everyone, come and take a look.

175
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:43,389
(She quietly walks away.)

176
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:44,849
So Min is confident about her decision.

177
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:47,649
(She believes in her decision.)

178
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:52,949
(Who is the lucky member that she chose?)

179
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:57,149
She lost her mind.

180
00:07:57,149 --> 00:07:58,819
(She picked Jae Seok and Kwang Soo.)

181
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:00,419
(Jae Seok gets 2. Kwang Soo gets 1.)

182
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,189
She lost her mind.

183
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:04,549
(Come here, you.)

184
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:05,889
What's wrong with you?

185
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:08,089
What's wrong, So Min?

186
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:10,149
- I'm sorry. - Why did you do that to me?

187
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:13,549
What's wrong with you? I told you to look at the overall picture.

188
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:15,989
- Look at the overall picture. - Why did you do that?

189
00:08:15,989 --> 00:08:17,219
- What's wrong with you? - It's...

190
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:18,919
It's because you had two Tour Stickers.

191
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:21,549
- My goodness. - She made her decision.

192
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,619
Who's next?

193
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:26,849
- It's all because of you, So Min. - How many does he have?

194
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:27,989
He has two.

195
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:29,649
(Does Jae Seok have two cards?)

196
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:32,049
What if Jae Seok has two Reflecting Cards?

197
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:34,119
There's no way he has two.

198
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:35,219
- Definitely not. - No.

199
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,149
It's because Jae Seok is the type to attack others.

200
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:40,889
(Attack others?)

201
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,519
- He has Tour Stickers. - Right?

202
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,589
He may not have any Reflecting Cards.

203
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:46,149
He'd never buy two of them.

204
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:48,789
- That's what I thought. - Okay, everybody.

205
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:51,289
(Haha makes his decision.)

206
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:52,849
It's Jong Kook.

207
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:57,519
(Haha puts a Tour Sticker next to Jong Kook's name.)

208
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,319
(How dare you?)

209
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:01,819
(Laughing)

210
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:04,019
What a piece of trash.

211
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:08,189
(How dare you target me?)

212
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,589
(Haha puts a Tour Sticker on Jong Kook.)

213
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:14,489
- I understand now. - This is the last one.

214
00:09:14,489 --> 00:09:18,489
(Haha and Jong Kook target each other.)

215
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:23,019
Is it finally my turn?

216
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:27,249
(The last member to go is Jae Seok.)

217
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:32,689
(Jae Seok has about 200 dollars.)

218
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:37,089
(Does Jae Seok have 4 Tour Stickers or 2 Reflecting Cards?)

219
00:09:37,349 --> 00:09:39,149
(What does he have?)

220
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:40,489
I've been waiting for this day.

221
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:42,389
(What does he have?)

222
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:44,219
You know exactly the type of person I am.

223
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:45,889
(You were right.)

224
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,419
(What does he mean by that?)

225
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:51,749
(He targets them.)

226
00:09:51,749 --> 00:09:53,089
He has four of them.

227
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:55,189
(I have four Tour Stickers.)

228
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:58,559
(He bought four Tour Stickers and no Reflecting Cards.)

229
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,649
He has four?

230
00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:01,389
He will always attack.

231
00:10:01,749 --> 00:10:04,389
(It's better to attack with Tour Stickers.)

232
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:05,589
So Min, you're in danger.

233
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:09,519
I choose you, So Min.

234
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,919
(She's doomed.)

235
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,519
So Min.

236
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:15,649
(So Min is about to be doomed.)

237
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,149
So Min.

238
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:20,189
- I had no idea that he had four. - So Min.

239
00:10:20,189 --> 00:10:21,849
I choose So Min.

240
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:23,749
I like to jump into the fire.

241
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,749
(He likes to be daring just like So Min.)

242
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,519
Jae Seok is so fiery.

243
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,489
- Here's one for Haha. - Come on.

244
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:31,989
Ji Hyo will be bored, Jae Seok.

245
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:35,389
And then he suddenly attacks Ji Hyo.

246
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:38,489
(Let us surprise her with Tour Stickers.)

247
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:41,589
She doesn't say a word at important times like this.

248
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:43,389
(4 Tour Stickers leave her speechless.)

249
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:46,119
- I have no idea. - Should we look away?

250
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:47,989
- Should we stay away? - Should we?

251
00:10:47,989 --> 00:10:49,819
- Please turn around. - Come to the back.

252
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,619
Everyone knows that...

253
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:53,019
- he'll attack So Min. - Jae Seok.

254
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:58,749
(I beg you on my knees not to give me three Stickers.)

255
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:00,319
- Jae Seok. - Don't you remember...

256
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:02,589
what you've done to me?

257
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:04,349
Did you put this here, So Min?

258
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:06,219
(What is he talking about?)

259
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:08,619
- Yes, she did. - I see.

260
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:10,349
What's wrong with you?

261
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:11,849
Goodness.

262
00:11:11,849 --> 00:11:14,489
I just wanted to ask.

263
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:16,889
He has no idea what's going on.

264
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:18,949
- What's wrong with him? - He was confused.

265
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:20,889
Then why did he laugh with us?

266
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,849
(What was Seok Jin laughing at?)

267
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,549
It's because we sacrificed sleep to see the dolphins.

268
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:26,719
I couldn't sleep.

269
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:27,919
(He blames the dolphins.)

270
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:30,119
- Shall we move back? - Yes.

271
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:31,719
Let's step back.

272
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:33,049
I'll go to Hawaii.

273
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:34,989
(He ponders.)

274
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:37,289
For now...

275
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:38,419
(The past is in the past.)

276
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:45,519
(Jae Seok has four Tour Stickers.)

277
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,989
(Will he choose So Min who attacked him mercilessly?)

278
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:52,749
(Or will he choose other members?)

279
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:54,889
I was completely duped.

280
00:11:54,889 --> 00:12:00,719
(Whom will Jae Seok appoint to go on the Dangerous Trip?)

281
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,289
(He makes shooting sounds again.)

282
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:06,019
(Jae Seok makes his decision.)

283
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:07,189
Let's go.

284
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:09,389
Are you finished?

285
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:12,319
I made a clear decision.

286
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:13,949
(Everyone is at risk.)

287
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:20,189
(Who will go with Jae Seok on the Dangerous Trip?)

288
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:24,249
- Darn it. - It's time to party.

289
00:12:24,249 --> 00:12:25,349
It's time to party.

290
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:27,019
- It's time to party. - Goodness.

291
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:31,489
(Jae Seok chooses Haha and So Min.)

292
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:33,889
- It's time to party. - It's fine.

293
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:36,119
That was a wise decision.

294
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:39,249
- Kwang Soo and So Min. - That's right.

295
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:41,089
This is like "The Sixth Sense".

296
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:43,549
There are twists within twists.

297
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:48,419
I understand now.

298
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:52,449
- Isn't that too many of us? - It is.

299
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:54,619
- That's too many. - What about Jong Kook and Ji Hyo?

300
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:56,449
(The chosen members are finalized.)

301
00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:00,619
There's a total of 6 members with 3 Tour Stickers.

302
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:02,449
It's 6 out of 8 members.

303
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,149
- Everyone goes somewhere together. - Really?

304
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:06,889
(The other 2 members will come.)

305
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:09,289
Everyone will go somewhere together.

306
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,489
Everyone?

307
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:13,789
Only the six members will experience the Dangerous Tour.

308
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:16,389
That's too many. Let's move the stickers.

309
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:19,849
Could you exclude 2 out of 6 members?

310
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,389
Among the six members,

311
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:24,649
please choose a leader.

312
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:26,289
What will the leader do?

313
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,749
- The tour destinations include... - Does the leader choose?

314
00:13:30,989 --> 00:13:32,949
Hawaii, Indonesia, Japan, and many more.

315
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:34,519
(It's a difficult decision.)

316
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,519
The leader decides where you will go.

317
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:39,249
(Shark cage, USA)

318
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:41,619
(Cage of Death, Australia)

319
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,089
(Fly Toledo, Spain)

320
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:46,489
(Active volcano in Mount Bromo and Mount Ijen, Indonesia)

321
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:49,249
(Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear, Japan)

322
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:52,249
(Nevis Swing, New Zealand)

323
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:54,589
(Insano water slide, Brazil)

324
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:58,189
(Where will the members go?)

325
00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:00,419
- You should be the leader. - I'll be the leader.

326
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:03,249
He's lucky today.

327
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:05,689
- It's because... - He's lucky today.

328
00:14:05,689 --> 00:14:06,889
I'm lucky today.

329
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,089
Okay.

330
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:14,649
(Jae Seok will choose one ball.)

331
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:19,689
Which Dangerous Tourist Attraction will Jae Seok choose?

332
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:22,019
Please don't say it like that.

333
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,989
Don't pick anything with heights or ghosts.

334
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:27,189
Didn't you see me win during Dangerous Shoe Throw?

335
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:30,119
Jae Seok, pick a ball with your foot.

336
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,149
- Your feet are lucky today. - Listen.

337
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:34,119
- I saved you today. - That's true.

338
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:35,349
- Haha was being annoying. - Okay.

339
00:14:35,349 --> 00:14:36,889
- Hurry and choose. - Okay.

340
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:38,549
Don't pick Labyrinth of Fear.

341
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:39,989
You should practice picking.

342
00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:45,449
You'd better pick well. Don't pick the one in Japan.

343
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:48,689
(It's scary enough to appear on the Guinness World Records.)

344
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:50,219
No heights and no Labyrinth of Fear.

345
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:53,849
(The pressure is immense from an incredible height.)

346
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:56,549
(Nevis Swing, New Zealand and Insano water slide, Brazil)

347
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:58,049
I'd rather die.

348
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,949
- Labyrinth of Fear is the worst. - I agree.

349
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:03,789
Volcanoes are also scary.

350
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:08,249
(Among the world's seven Dangerous Tourist Attractions...)

351
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:10,149
- Did you pick one? - No heights or Japan.

352
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:11,349
I don't know.

353
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:13,119
You must pick well.

354
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:14,649
No heights or ghosts.

355
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:19,249
(Which place did Jae Seok pick?)

356
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:25,289
(He shuffles the balls.)

357
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:27,349
(This one feels right.)

358
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:29,489
(Please pick a good one.)

359
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:30,949
- Did you pick one? - No heights or Labyrinth of Fear.

360
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:31,989
- I don't know. - Let's see.

361
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:34,689
(Which one did Jae Seok pick?)

362
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:37,989
- Gosh. - Why did you pick this?

363
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:39,589
(What kind of reaction is it?)

364
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:42,119
No heights or Japan.

365
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:43,649
- I don't know. - Let's see.

366
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:46,719
- Gosh. - Why did you pick this?

367
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:48,589
- No. - Let's see.

368
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:50,089
- He lost his mind. - He picked one.

369
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:51,549
- I saw it. - He picked a ball.

370
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:53,219
(Which Tourist Attraction did he pick?)

371
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:56,489
- Please show us the ball. - I can't believe him.

372
00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:00,189
Everyone is murmuring right now.

373
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,349
I've lost my mind.

374
00:16:02,349 --> 00:16:04,189
Let's pick another one.

375
00:16:05,219 --> 00:16:07,549
- He's so unlucky. - Which one is it?

376
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,289
(He picked Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear, Japan.)

377
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:11,349
It's Japan.

378
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:14,889
Why did you pick that of all places?

379
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:18,349
- Gosh. - He's so terrible.

380
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:19,749
Did you really pick that?

381
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:21,049
Please show it to us.

382
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:24,149
The Dangerous Tourist Attraction is...

383
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,949
- the one in Japan. - Hey!

384
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:31,649
(Everyone gets upset.)

385
00:16:32,849 --> 00:16:37,319
(Welcome to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

386
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:39,649
How could I have known?

387
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,519
- Are they all for Japan? - My goodness.

388
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:45,789
No, he picked one ball for Japan.

389
00:16:46,219 --> 00:16:49,219
I wanted to go to the shark cage in Hawaii.

390
00:16:49,219 --> 00:16:51,149
(He wanted to go to Hawaii.)

391
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:52,519
He's an American.

392
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:53,819
I wanted to go.

393
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:56,149
Here are the members...

394
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,449
to be punished on Dangerous Tourist Attractions.

395
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:02,689
They're Jae Seok, So Min, Seok Jin, Se Chan, Kwang Soo, and Haha.

396
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,589
This is so unfair.

397
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:08,049
- You'll be going to Japan. - This is the least fair to me.

398
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:10,589
Getting a visa to film in Japan will take some time.

399
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:13,419
We'll go to Japan as soon as we're ready.

400
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:15,689
What if you're haunted by the ghosts?

401
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:17,349
You have no other choice.

402
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:20,589
What if while children watch Running Man on TV,

403
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,189
we crawl out of the screen?

404
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:25,089
(What if the members pop out of the screen and scare them?)

405
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:27,189
What will you do then?

406
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:30,519
You should give R Badge or something to the ones who get possessed.

407
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,219
If that happened, you should admit they got possessed...

408
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:34,889
for the program's sake.

409
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:37,449
Jae Seok is the one at fault.

410
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:38,649
- What did I do wrong? - So later,

411
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:40,149
let's spin it once more...

412
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:42,149
in front of that ghost's house.

413
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:44,019
That's a great idea. Let's do it just once.

414
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:46,219
- Are you possessed already? - We...

415
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:47,919
(Possessed)

416
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:50,449
- "Who are you?" - "Who are you?"

417
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:52,149
(Hey, producers. Aren't I cute?)

418
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:55,019
(It's for certain they really don't want to go.)

419
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,049
Goodness.

420
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:58,089
Just once.

421
00:17:58,089 --> 00:17:59,419
- Okay? - You...

422
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:01,689
- In front of the entrance. - Let's say he's in.

423
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:02,719
- In front of it. - Do you think I'm crazy?

424
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:03,949
- For us five. Okay? - Why should I go in?

425
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,419
- Okay? - Deal!

426
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:07,489
(Those 6 cowards play especially dirty today.)

427
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:10,219
While we're issuing the visa,

428
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:12,019
we will have some time.

429
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:14,619
So we will plan a special to exclude whom in the meantime.

430
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:15,619
- Great. - Okay.

431
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:17,089
- Thanks. - We'll think about it.

432
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:18,589
(How will their fate turn out to be?)

433
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:22,289
(A week later, Mok-dong SBS)

434
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:23,319
(Let's go on the tour!)

435
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,049
(Congratulations on your tour for Super Scary Labyrinth!)

436
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:27,019
- Hello. - I'm going for certain.

437
00:18:27,449 --> 00:18:29,449
- It's almost decided, right? - Right.

438
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:30,759
(It's the cruel ending of the Tour Sticker battle.)

439
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,789
(The victor is relaxed and excited.)

440
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:35,019
Everyone, did you see the banner behind you?

441
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:36,449
What is that?

442
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:38,689
- Goodness! - We're going at last.

443
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:40,019
Is it something to congratulate?

444
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,149
Yes! We're going.

445
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:44,189
It's rather something painful.

446
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:46,489
After a long journey of our first global project,

447
00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:48,519
Dangerous Tour,

448
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:50,449
we have decided...

449
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:52,189
- I'm going crazy. - the six members...

450
00:18:52,189 --> 00:18:55,819
- to leave for Japan. - So why did he choose Japan?

451
00:18:55,819 --> 00:18:57,049
Six members?

452
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:59,049
- It's all the same anyway. - We had the shark cage.

453
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:00,419
It's close to here at least.

454
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:01,789
- I heard from them briefly, - Six members are too many.

455
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:03,089
and it's worse than your imagination.

456
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:05,489
- That's what I'm saying. - He's so annoying.

457
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:08,319
- You're not even going. - I know. He's not even going.

458
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,049
- Why did you do the research? - He can't stop smiling.

459
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,819
Move aside. Just get lost.

460
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:13,289
(He's so annoyed.)

461
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:14,649
He keeps teasing us when he's not going.

462
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:16,649
- He's so annoying. - Come here.

463
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:19,449
Whatever. You guys just date.

464
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:22,189
Come here, Jong Kook.

465
00:19:22,189 --> 00:19:24,049
(It's more annoying because they accept the teasing.)

466
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:25,149
Don't tease them.

467
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:27,389
- You can't tease them. - We never get worked up.

468
00:19:27,389 --> 00:19:28,819
- They don't care. - We're never upset about our jokes.

469
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:32,019
So we're on the progress of issuing the visa at the moment.

470
00:19:32,389 --> 00:19:33,919
The staff has visited the place last week.

471
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,089
- I see. - We know.

472
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:36,219
You guys look so pale.

473
00:19:36,219 --> 00:19:38,289
- They said it's no joke. - I think some of you are missing.

474
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:40,019
- Are you sure you're not possessed? - The number is fewer than before.

475
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:42,419
- They look so blank. - Bring me salt, please.

476
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,549
We noticed something unusual.

477
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:47,719
They were selling underwear near the exit.

478
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:51,259
(It's for the visitors to take care of accidents.)

479
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:53,219
(Two days ago in Tokyo)

480
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:55,219
Look at the mannequins.

481
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:59,589
(It's scary from the start.)

482
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:01,419
(My gosh, it's so scary.)

483
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:04,119
Goodness.

484
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:05,389
(Freaking out)

485
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:07,319
(Frightened)

486
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:09,319
(Some of them gave up in the middle.)

487
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:10,889
(Main scriptwriter)

488
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:14,719
- Do they really sell underwear? - Yes.

489
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:15,949
We're already...

490
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:18,419
(They should bring extra underwear.)

491
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:20,649
Before we leave for Japan, we've decided to...

492
00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:21,949
throw you a party since you worked hard...

493
00:20:21,949 --> 00:20:24,389
- for this special. - I see.

494
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,089
It's not something to celebrate.

495
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:28,019
- Are you serious? - Must you have prepared this?

496
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,759
They're feeding us before making us suffer more.

497
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,889
The celebration party we've prepared for today...

498
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,759
is about sending only four of you off to the tour.

499
00:20:34,889 --> 00:20:36,089
It's called The Chosen Four.

500
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:37,349
- Only 4? - 4?

501
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:40,759
It's called The Chosen Four.

502
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:41,759
- Only 4? - 4?

503
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:43,289
(They're surprised.)

504
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:44,519
(Did you just say only four will go?)

505
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,889
- Are you serious? - What?

506
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:47,049
- Did you say 4? - 2 of us can survive?

507
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:48,789
- 2 of us will be exempted. - 2 of us!

508
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,649
- Yes! - Only 4 will go!

509
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:52,349
- Yes! - This is it!

510
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:53,889
(Due to team balance, 2 will be exempted.)

511
00:20:53,889 --> 00:20:56,649
- This is why people live in hope. - I'm serious now.

512
00:20:56,649 --> 00:20:59,289
In my opinion, Kwang Soo...

513
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:00,789
would want to go.

514
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:02,049
- Why would I? - I mean...

515
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:04,919
Why would I want to be possessed?

516
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:07,349
Why would I want to pee in my pants?

517
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:08,649
He wants to go.

518
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:11,549
So Min would want to go as well.

519
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:13,389
- No way. - She's curious.

520
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:15,259
You don't want to go, but you will have no choice.

521
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:18,219
(It's the fact that he will eventually have to go.)

522
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,219
- Right. - You're going for certain.

523
00:21:20,219 --> 00:21:21,589
- Hey. - I'm serious.

524
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:22,949
I...

525
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:25,349
We will exempt the two of you...

526
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:27,289
according to the results...

527
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:28,419
- of today's mission. - Okay.

528
00:21:28,949 --> 00:21:30,049
(Desperate)

529
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:33,719
There will be two courses of meals prepared at a dining place outside.

530
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:34,759
Really?

531
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:36,649
The two people whose names are called will head there.

532
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:40,219
They will choose a course they want after checking the ingredients.

533
00:21:40,219 --> 00:21:41,589
- Then... - Okay.

534
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:43,849
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo will go first...

535
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:45,789
- and choose a course. - Are we up?

536
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:47,119
So the two have to make different choices.

537
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,489
- They can't make the same choice. - Right.

538
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:50,689
(What is hidden behind today's course meal?)

539
00:21:50,689 --> 00:21:52,419
What is that? It's alive.

540
00:21:53,719 --> 00:21:56,489
(Lamb chop versus king crab)

541
00:21:56,489 --> 00:21:59,089
(It's the highlight of seafood that looks amazing and tastes great.)

542
00:21:59,349 --> 00:22:02,019
My goodness. I'm choosing lamb chops. Those king crabs are alive.

543
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:04,749
(Juicy and delicious lamb chops)

544
00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:05,789
This is it.

545
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,789
- What do you want to have? - I choose this.

546
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:10,419
- All right. We've done choosing. - I want something dead.

547
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:12,349
King crabs are good for your health.

548
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:13,819
- Goodness. - And...

549
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:15,719
Move to the table if you're done with your choices.

550
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:16,949
- Okay. - Table?

551
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:20,049
(It does look like a party.)

552
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:21,319
My goodness.

553
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:23,219
(The table on the left has various grilled meat.)

554
00:22:23,219 --> 00:22:24,349
- Right. - This table is for lamb chops?

555
00:22:25,349 --> 00:22:28,919
(The table on the right has tasty dishes including king crab.)

556
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:31,049
I see they grilled the lamb chop like steak.

557
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:32,149
(What do these ingredients mean?)

558
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:33,819
(Next up are Jae Seok and Haha.)

559
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:35,189
Do you have king crab in the morning?

560
00:22:35,349 --> 00:22:36,649
I'll choose these lamb chops.

561
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:37,819
(Jae Seok chose lamb chops, and Haha chose king crab.)

562
00:22:37,949 --> 00:22:39,489
Jong Kook chose king crab.

563
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:40,989
I chose king crab too.

564
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:43,249
(Next up are So Min and Se Chan.)

565
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:45,519
- All right. I choose this. - Will you be all right?

566
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:47,719
- Is that right? - So Min is in our group?

567
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:50,489
- Welcome. - Thanks.

568
00:22:50,489 --> 00:22:52,819
(He's worried with Ji Hyo and So Min in his group.)

569
00:22:52,819 --> 00:22:54,389
- I think Kwang Soo... - I think...

570
00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:55,889
- Welcome. - Kwang Soo...

571
00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:57,249
- I chose the king crab. - Okay!

572
00:22:57,249 --> 00:22:59,289
- My goodness. - This should be the way it is.

573
00:22:59,689 --> 00:23:01,289
- Well... - We're in trouble now.

574
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:02,489
It's going strange now.

575
00:23:02,489 --> 00:23:03,649
How did it turn out this way?

576
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,449
We have the weakest members here.

577
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:07,889
- I haven't felt this in a while. - Gosh.

578
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:09,819
- It's not right. - I may not go to the ghost's house.

579
00:23:09,819 --> 00:23:13,049
All right. Go ahead and enjoy your meal.

580
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:14,219
- Can we eat now? - Gosh, this...

581
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:15,889
- Haha. - Do we just eat?

582
00:23:15,889 --> 00:23:18,189
- Give us gloves. - I have a bad feeling about this.

583
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:20,149
Goodness.

584
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,449
What is this tea?

585
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:25,019
- It's called suutei tea. - What is this?

586
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:27,589
(Suutei tea is a kind of milk tea that is seasoned with salt.)

587
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:29,189
- Suutei tea. - Milk tea.

588
00:23:29,189 --> 00:23:30,949
(Why are they giving us this special tea?)

589
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:33,189
(Without any doubt, they start boning the king crab.)

590
00:23:33,189 --> 00:23:34,219
Look at this meat.

591
00:23:34,219 --> 00:23:35,749
It's so plump.

592
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:36,819
(It's filled with meat.)

593
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,589
(They're fully enjoying the party.)

594
00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:41,719
Look at this meat.

595
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:44,049
It's so delicious. I haven't had this for a long time.

596
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:46,489
(They have completely forgotten about the labyrinth.)

597
00:23:46,489 --> 00:23:47,519
It's good.

598
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:49,949
Now, I'm craving king crabs.

599
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:51,389
- Hey. - Look at those king crabs.

600
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:52,419
(The two teams enjoy their meals.)

601
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:53,689
It's only in the morning.

602
00:23:53,689 --> 00:23:55,519
- But we're filling ourselves. - Right.

603
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,689
So Jong Kook and Ji Hyo...

604
00:23:58,219 --> 00:24:00,449
are just helping out their teams?

605
00:24:00,449 --> 00:24:01,619
Yes, they are the team leaders.

606
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:03,049
- I see. - Team leaders?

607
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:04,489
Yes, they are the team leaders.

608
00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:06,049
(They are the team leaders for today.)

609
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:07,249
That's good to hear.

610
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:09,989
If I were in that team, Jong Kook would be my team leader.

611
00:24:09,989 --> 00:24:12,419
- Gosh. - That's one good thing.

612
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:14,019
I should have him as my team member someday.

613
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:16,289
Lucky me.

614
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,919
Your team looks...

615
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,189
exactly like Jong Kook and his lackeys.

616
00:24:20,749 --> 00:24:21,889
You could've made our team perfect.

617
00:24:21,889 --> 00:24:23,589
What did you just say?

618
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:24,789
Jong Kook...

619
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:26,449
- and his lackeys. - You'd have been the same.

620
00:24:26,449 --> 00:24:28,649
- Be quiet. - You would've been the same.

621
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:30,489
I see your team...

622
00:24:30,489 --> 00:24:31,949
has two female members.

623
00:24:31,949 --> 00:24:33,689
You're not having one-sided love, are you?

624
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:35,449
(Two middle aged men's one-sided love)

625
00:24:35,449 --> 00:24:36,489
(So Min and Ji Hyo are like volunteers.)

626
00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:37,649
Give up on them already.

627
00:24:37,649 --> 00:24:39,589
- What did you just say? - This is ridiculous.

628
00:24:39,589 --> 00:24:41,349
- You must spend a lot of money. - What did you just say?

629
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:43,789
- One-sided love? - What?

630
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:46,449
- Sit down. - All right.

631
00:24:46,449 --> 00:24:48,849
(Good boy, Jae Seok.)

632
00:24:49,249 --> 00:24:51,049
(Ji Hyo is the queen bee in the team.)

633
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:53,889
I'll sit down immediately if that's what you want.

634
00:24:53,889 --> 00:24:56,719
- You're lucky to be in this team. - Of course.

635
00:24:56,949 --> 00:24:59,789
For your information, the two team leaders...

636
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:03,749
will decide the two members to be exempted from the tour...

637
00:25:03,889 --> 00:25:06,989
after today's mission.

638
00:25:07,949 --> 00:25:10,249
(The team leaders will decide...)

639
00:25:10,249 --> 00:25:13,349
(the two members to be exempted from the tour.)

640
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:15,689
I'm so glad I'm not on his team.

641
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:17,789
(Standing up immediately)

642
00:25:17,989 --> 00:25:19,119
(Sorry, I didn't get to say hi yet.)

643
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:21,119
He wouldn't choose me for certain.

644
00:25:22,389 --> 00:25:24,189
- Do you want to eat anything? - Go sit down.

645
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,889
- Ji Hyo. - Let go.

646
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:27,749
- Ji Hyo. - Let her go.

647
00:25:27,749 --> 00:25:29,589
- Stop bugging me. - Ji Hyo hates things like that.

648
00:25:29,589 --> 00:25:32,549
- I hate things like this. - She doesn't like it.

649
00:25:33,189 --> 00:25:34,719
(They're treating him like a VIP.)

650
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:36,549
- I count on you. - Ji Hyo hates things like that.

651
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:39,249
By the way, Se Chan didn't call me even once...

652
00:25:39,249 --> 00:25:42,349
- outside the shooting. - My goodness.

653
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:44,489
- He thought lowly of you. - That was too harsh.

654
00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:46,789
(You rude punk!)

655
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:47,849
Why would you do that?

656
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:49,589
- That was out of line. - Scold him.

657
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:51,289
Se Chan, you may not know well about...

658
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:53,089
how variety shows work,

659
00:25:53,349 --> 00:25:54,719
but this is all... You know?

660
00:25:54,849 --> 00:25:56,919
- It's all about relationships. - Right.

661
00:25:56,919 --> 00:25:58,049
(The relationship is irreparable now.)

662
00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:00,489
Considering you're done with your meal,

663
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:03,049
I will now give you the first quiz that has Chance Card on the line.

664
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:04,119
Chance Card?

665
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,219
Trust me.

666
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:06,789
Here's the quiz.

667
00:26:06,949 --> 00:26:11,289
Where are the dishes you just ate from?

668
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,489
Haha!

669
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:13,519
(They're ready to answer already.)

670
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:14,949
- Russia. - Russia.

671
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:17,689
- It's Russia. - King crabs are caught in Russia.

672
00:26:17,689 --> 00:26:19,249
It's not caught in Korea for certain.

673
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,919
- New Zealand. - No.

674
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:22,489
- It's from New Zealand. - Lamb meat...

675
00:26:22,489 --> 00:26:24,789
It's usually from New Zealand or Australia.

676
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:27,149
- It's not right. - Hold on.

677
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:28,549
- It's right. - Shut it!

678
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:29,749
I buy them often.

679
00:26:29,749 --> 00:26:31,649
- So I know. - That's only the usual case.

680
00:26:31,649 --> 00:26:32,689
It says they're from New Zealand.

681
00:26:32,689 --> 00:26:34,319
I think it's done once they answer.

682
00:26:34,489 --> 00:26:35,919
- What? - Why would you shout?

683
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,049
- Don't shout at our team leader! - Seriously.

684
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:39,419
How dare he!

685
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:41,149
- Good job. - You can't do that.

686
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:43,289
How dare you point at my team member?

687
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:44,849
He wasn't pointing at him.

688
00:26:44,849 --> 00:26:46,119
How dare you!

689
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,219
(How dare a newbie act rude?)

690
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:48,819
(Ji Hyo's attack started the battle between the two team.)

691
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:50,489
- What's wrong with her? - Stop it.

692
00:26:50,489 --> 00:26:52,849
- You punks! - Seriously!

693
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:55,189
Seriously.

694
00:26:55,189 --> 00:26:56,789
(Nice catch!)

695
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:59,619
(He caught Seok Jin's slow throw.)

696
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:00,749
I caught it.

697
00:27:00,889 --> 00:27:02,689
(Our team must not lose at anything.)

698
00:27:02,749 --> 00:27:05,119
I should step in after a long time.

699
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:08,149
(Killer Yu of Sanitary Glove Gang)

700
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:09,249
- Jae Seok. - What do you think you're doing?

701
00:27:09,249 --> 00:27:10,519
Don't wear those gloves. They might get hurt.

702
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:12,989
Shall I bring it on, wearing my gloves?

703
00:27:13,489 --> 00:27:15,319
- They might get hurt. - Stop.

704
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:17,119
- What are you doing? - You're safe thanks to me.

705
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:19,449
Killers like us don't leave a trace.

706
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:22,449
- Both of you, sit down. - Will you serve me the food?

707
00:27:22,449 --> 00:27:24,519
- Both of you will get hurt. - Don't put on the gloves.

708
00:27:24,589 --> 00:27:25,989
You punks.

709
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,849
Go to Russia. This king crab is from Russia.

710
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:29,019
No, this is from Chile.

711
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:30,589
This king crab is from Chile.

712
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:32,189
- I advise you to go with Chile. - I second that.

713
00:27:32,189 --> 00:27:33,989
Have you ever had king crab from Chile?

714
00:27:33,989 --> 00:27:35,049
I have seen it.

715
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:37,289
- Please make your decisions. - We should choose this one...

716
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:38,489
since this one is the most well-known.

717
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:39,649
- Okay. - This is better.

718
00:27:39,649 --> 00:27:40,649
Team Jong Kook.

719
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:41,689
- It's Russia. - It's Russia.

720
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:43,649
(Team Jong Kook's answer is Russia.)

721
00:27:43,649 --> 00:27:46,089
Team Jong Kook, the answer for its origin of the product is...

722
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:50,449
(Is the king crab Team Jong Kook ate really from Russia?)

723
00:27:51,849 --> 00:27:52,849
This has to be correct.

724
00:27:52,849 --> 00:27:53,849
The answer is Russia.

725
00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:55,019
(Their answer, Russia, is correct!)

726
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:56,019
(Yes! We got it right!)

727
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:57,449
- Jong Kook. - Trust me.

728
00:27:57,449 --> 00:27:58,989
(Gosh, we're envious.)

729
00:27:58,989 --> 00:28:00,919
Jong Kook, I thought the answer was Russia from the start.

730
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:03,649
- Hey, you said it was from Chile! - Stop it.

731
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:05,589
- Stay out of this, Se Chan. - Hey, he said it was from Chile.

732
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:07,319
- Chile? - Haha, I'm on your side.

733
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,189
- Do you want Jong Kook to fail? - Jong Kook, I am sorry.

734
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:10,889
What is the origin of your food? In 1, 2, 3.

735
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,389
- New Zealand. - Seok Jin keeps saying...

736
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:14,419
Let's go with New Zealand. I'm telling you. It's from New Zealand.

737
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:17,289
Team Ji Hyo, your answer was New Zealand.

738
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:19,389
- Now that I think of it... - The origin of your food is...

739
00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:20,489
(Seok Jin insists the answer is New Zealand.)

740
00:28:20,489 --> 00:28:24,189
(Just like Team Jong Kook, will Team Ji Hyo's answer be correct?)

741
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:26,449
The answer is Mongolia.

742
00:28:26,449 --> 00:28:28,019
(The answer is Mongolia.)

743
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:30,349
(Seok Jin has done it again.)

744
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:31,919
How can the lamb be from Mongolia?

745
00:28:31,949 --> 00:28:33,589
It has to come from New Zealand. Go to the supermarket.

746
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:35,119
- It's all from New Zealand. - The answer was Mongolia.

747
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:37,289
Since Team Jong Kook guessed the origin of the food correctly,

748
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:39,089
- you may take the Blue Chance Card. - Okay!

749
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:40,619
Don't read it yet.

750
00:28:40,689 --> 00:28:42,689
- Don't read it yet. - Don't read it yet.

751
00:28:42,949 --> 00:28:44,689
- My goodness. - Kwang Soo.

752
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:45,689
(Team Ji Hyo gets the Pink Chance Card.)

753
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:47,919
- How many are there? - There are four.

754
00:28:48,189 --> 00:28:50,049
- We had a great start. - Yes, we did.

755
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:54,119
Everyone, now you can read the card inside the envelope.

756
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,219
- Can we read it now? - Do we each get one?

757
00:28:55,219 --> 00:28:56,549
Everyone can read a card each.

758
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:57,889
- What is this? - See? Look at this.

759
00:28:57,889 --> 00:28:59,549
- "Vladivostok..." - What?

760
00:29:00,689 --> 00:29:02,049
- What is this? - See? Look at this.

761
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:03,089
- "Vladivostok..." - What?

762
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:04,389
(What is this now?)

763
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:05,849
- Hold on. We're going there? - Hey.

764
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,749
(The identity of the Chance Cards was...)

765
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:09,919
(flight tickets.)

766
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:12,549
What on earth is this?

767
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,689
- Lately, you've been... - Let me tell you...

768
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,589
- Wait. - what this race is about.

769
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:19,289
The food you enjoyed just now...

770
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:21,389
is the Dangerous Meal.

771
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:25,089
Each team will travel to the origin of the food...

772
00:29:25,089 --> 00:29:28,549
(They will set off for the country.)

773
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,549
You must find the ingredients in that country and come back.

774
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:33,549
- Excuse me. Hold on. - We are going to Russia?

775
00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:34,589
(Go where? What is he saying?)

776
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:35,919
He must be out of his mind.

777
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,949
We are going to Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia?

778
00:29:38,189 --> 00:29:41,219
Since Team Ji Hyo enjoyed a meal from Mongolia,

779
00:29:41,589 --> 00:29:44,689
you will go to Mongolia, meet nomads,

780
00:29:44,689 --> 00:29:47,119
milk the sheep personally, and bring the milk back.

781
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:54,789
(You want us to meet nomads and milk the sheep?)

782
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:57,189
Since we ate lamb, we have to go to Mongolia?

783
00:29:57,189 --> 00:30:00,019
We have to go to Mongolia, meet nomads, and milk the sheep?

784
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:02,319
Since Team Jong Kook had a Russian meal,

785
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:04,549
- What is this? - go to Russia,

786
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:07,049
visit the Sea of Okhotsk, and catch king crabs.

787
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:08,119
- Sea of Okhotsk? - Sea of Okhotsk?

788
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:09,289
- Did you say Sea of Okhotsk? - You must catch king crabs.

789
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:11,119
(They are completely bewildered. They can't believe it.)

790
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:13,389
You mean the Sea of Okhotsk that I learned about in school?

791
00:30:13,389 --> 00:30:15,419
- The Sea of Okhotsk? - You must be out of your senses.

792
00:30:15,949 --> 00:30:18,089
What have we done wrong?

793
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:21,649
- Our mission is better than theirs. - How will they catch them?

794
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:24,689
I saw how they catch king crabs in a documentary. I saw people dying.

795
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:26,289
- A couple of people really died. - Were you aware of this?

796
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:28,849
At first, there were 10 people on the ship and when they were...

797
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:30,819
at the sea, all of a sudden, there were only eight.

798
00:30:31,889 --> 00:30:34,389
(Let us reveal the documentary Jong Kook watched.)

799
00:30:34,389 --> 00:30:35,949
(It only looks tough.)

800
00:30:35,949 --> 00:30:39,449
(In reality, it is quite a safe job.)

801
00:30:39,689 --> 00:30:41,919
- We have to get on that ship. - We must go to Japan after this.

802
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:42,949
Exactly.

803
00:30:42,949 --> 00:30:44,649
We have to get the punishment.

804
00:30:44,649 --> 00:30:46,989
But we figured out where the food came from.

805
00:30:46,989 --> 00:30:48,919
- There's a benefit for that, right? - Do we get something for that?

806
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:50,689
Hold on. What do we get for our correct answer?

807
00:30:50,689 --> 00:30:53,089
There isn't a benefit. They just received the envelopes first.

808
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,919
- No way. - Come on. Seriously?

809
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,589
- Hey. - There must be something.

810
00:30:56,589 --> 00:30:57,919
I should have said Chile.

811
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,449
- I can't believe this. - Really?

812
00:30:59,449 --> 00:31:00,949
This is driving me crazy.

813
00:31:00,949 --> 00:31:02,649
- Jae Seok, are we really going? - We are really going there.

814
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:03,919
I guess so.

815
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,989
Since we are catching king crabs, shouldn't they catch the sheep too?

816
00:31:06,989 --> 00:31:08,919
- Why would we do that? - You should.

817
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:10,689
- Why would we catch them? - Then we will milk the king crabs.

818
00:31:10,689 --> 00:31:12,989
(That is only fair.)

819
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:14,889
- That's right. - Hey, how can we milk them?

820
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:17,849
- If we try, it might be possible. - There must be something.

821
00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:19,089
Seriously.

822
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:20,649
(Moments later, at the land of Genghis Khan,)

823
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:22,649
(the members have arrived.)

824
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:24,919
(They went with the sole purpose of sheep milk.)

825
00:31:25,189 --> 00:31:27,019
In my opinion, this isn't the right ship.

826
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:30,189
(Catch king crabs with methods you have never heard or seen)

827
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:32,819
(Their journeys will air soon.)

828
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:37,019
We will begin Dangerous Quiz, and a Chance Card is at stake.

829
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:39,989
We must decide the order you will solve the quizzes.

830
00:31:39,989 --> 00:31:42,889
We will play Be Irrelevant which is the official game of our show.

831
00:31:42,889 --> 00:31:43,889
All right.

832
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:45,449
- I don't know about this. - I am so bad at this.

833
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:48,049
I don't even like the name of the game.

834
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:50,049
- The game is named after Seok Jin. - Right.

835
00:31:50,049 --> 00:31:52,219
The game should have been famous long before.

836
00:31:52,219 --> 00:31:54,289
This game isn't popular because it's named after him.

837
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:55,889
- I see. - What? Hey.

838
00:31:55,889 --> 00:31:58,889
- This is actually a fun game. - Should we name it after you then?

839
00:31:58,889 --> 00:32:01,049
- My friends are crazy for the game. - Right.

840
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:04,119
- Since the name isn't appealing... - Exactly.

841
00:32:04,449 --> 00:32:06,589
- Why are you being mean too? - You have a valid point.

842
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:07,649
- Hey. - It's true.

843
00:32:07,649 --> 00:32:08,989
Did I come up with the name?

844
00:32:08,989 --> 00:32:10,219
(He feels this isn't fair.)

845
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:12,549
It's true. Seok Jin wasn't involved in the naming process.

846
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:14,049
- Don't call it after me then! - If you...

847
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:15,989
- Seok Jin didn't say anything! - Stop it then!

848
00:32:15,989 --> 00:32:18,749
- Did I name the game? - In the history of his career,

849
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:21,519
this was the first time something was named after him.

850
00:32:21,849 --> 00:32:22,849
(He bragged to his friends.)

851
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:24,849
It's a small segment of the show,

852
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:26,749
- but this is the first time. - Did I name the game?

853
00:32:26,749 --> 00:32:28,049
- I've never done it... - All right.

854
00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:29,489
- Let's start Be Irrelevant. - in my entire career.

855
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,849
Which team would like to go first?

856
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:34,119
- You should go first. - We got the correct answer.

857
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,589
- Haha, you should start. - We will let them start first.

858
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:36,689
- Why? - Team Jong Kook will go first.

859
00:32:36,689 --> 00:32:39,619
- We got the correct answer. - We guessed the right answer.

860
00:32:39,689 --> 00:32:41,649
Let them make a fool out of themselves first.

861
00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:43,289
Fine. I will do an acrostic poem with Russia.

862
00:32:43,289 --> 00:32:46,049
Team Russia is starting.

863
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:47,489
Did you get that?

864
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:49,419
Gosh, that was so annoying.

865
00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:52,219
- Who's up? - Jong Kook. We'll start.

866
00:32:52,219 --> 00:32:53,419
- Get ready. - Okay.

867
00:32:54,189 --> 00:32:57,119
Start. What do you have in your refrigerator?

868
00:32:57,189 --> 00:32:58,189
A person.

869
00:32:59,089 --> 00:33:00,089
A person.

870
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:02,089
- Jong Kook, wait. - Hey, you!

871
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:04,389
- You are scary. - He's a scary guy.

872
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:08,049
(We thought you took out chicken breast from your refrigerator.)

873
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:11,649
(There must be other things along with chicken breast.)

874
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:14,089
(Strangely, it makes sense.)

875
00:33:14,089 --> 00:33:15,389
- This is... - Please keep it a secret!

876
00:33:15,389 --> 00:33:18,089
- Let's arrest him. - Viewers, don't report him!

877
00:33:18,089 --> 00:33:19,389
He has to be arrested.

878
00:33:19,389 --> 00:33:20,789
- No. - The person isn't dead.

879
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:22,819
- Arrest him! - I can swear on my life.

880
00:33:22,819 --> 00:33:24,549
- That's what you said. - I was going to say something else.

881
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:26,449
But I said, "person". I didn't mean it.

882
00:33:26,449 --> 00:33:29,049
- I really... - Let's do it again. This won't air.

883
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,389
- Don't kid yourself. - No.

884
00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:33,089
- I saw the body. - Let's do it again.

885
00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:34,989
- I don't think it's his first time. - Stop it.

886
00:33:34,989 --> 00:33:36,049
Gosh.

887
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:37,849
- All right. It's our turn. - Ji Hyo, we'll start.

888
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,849
Okay.

889
00:33:38,949 --> 00:33:39,989
Get ready.

890
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:43,489
Start. What do you want to eat right now the most?

891
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:44,689
ABC.

892
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,819
What do you want to eat right now the most?

893
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:47,049
(She's confident.)

894
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:49,449
- Hey! It's a chocolate brand! - It's a brand!

895
00:33:49,449 --> 00:33:51,189
(She's flustered. That's not what she meant.)

896
00:33:51,189 --> 00:33:52,819
- That's the name of the chocolate. - Hey, that's chocolate.

897
00:33:52,819 --> 00:33:54,549
- It's the name of the chocolate. - How can you eat the letters?

898
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:56,289
We can't mention brands on air!

899
00:33:56,289 --> 00:33:57,849
- So I avoided company names. - Fine.

900
00:33:57,849 --> 00:33:59,749
- Fine. - You can't think in advance.

901
00:33:59,749 --> 00:34:00,749
(Ji Hyo fails.)

902
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:02,919
- So... - Both teams failed.

903
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:04,389
Let's do rock-paper-scissors. We have no choice now.

904
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:06,189
- Pretend you are playing... - That was all for nothing then.

905
00:34:06,189 --> 00:34:07,219
This is intense.

906
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:08,819
- You can do it! - Rock-paper-scissors.

907
00:34:08,819 --> 00:34:10,489
(They came up with the order easily with this game.)

908
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,919
- Okay. - You can go first.

909
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:14,989
- You never lose this game. - You are so good.

910
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:18,989
Before you set out to the country,

911
00:34:19,189 --> 00:34:21,189
the Biggest Chance Card is at stake.

912
00:34:21,189 --> 00:34:22,889
(The Biggest Chance Card?)

913
00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:26,219
We will start Dangerous Quiz.

914
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,989
(They may earn a Chance Card.)

915
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:30,049
Okay. The Biggest Chance Card!

916
00:34:30,549 --> 00:34:33,719
The quiz is presented by the natives of Mongolia and Russia.

917
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:37,589
Get the right answer for the quiz meant for corresponding teams.

918
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:38,689
I think this is going to be hard.

919
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:41,919
When the team comes up with a wrong answer...

920
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:42,919
- Then? -Yes?

921
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:46,419
The opposing team will use the tool set aside for the question...

922
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:48,489
and punish the other team.

923
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:49,659
It will happen right now?

924
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:52,089
The team that answers more questions...

925
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:54,319
will get the Chance Card which will be...

926
00:34:54,319 --> 00:34:55,689
- advantageous during the mission. - Okay. I got it.

927
00:34:55,689 --> 00:34:57,019
(The team that answers more questions will get the Chance Card.)

928
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:01,749
(The Chance Card was a decisive factor in the last mission.)

929
00:35:01,749 --> 00:35:07,019
(The Chance Card managed to drag Team Osaka from its victory.)

930
00:35:08,049 --> 00:35:09,589
(Which team will take the Chance Card this time?)

931
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:13,089
- I will get this one right. - First, let me introduce...

932
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:14,889
Aengkeubayaseu Gallang...

933
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:17,089
and Ilya Belyakov who will present the questions.

934
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,659
- Hello. - Goodness.

935
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:20,449
- They're here. - He's from Russia.

936
00:35:20,449 --> 00:35:22,189
Isn't he from "Non-Summit"?

937
00:35:22,189 --> 00:35:24,119
- Goodness. Hi. - Hello.

938
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:25,589
- Hi. - Hello.

939
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:29,089
(They're Isijanchan Aengkeubayaseu Gallang and Ilya Belyakov.)

940
00:35:29,389 --> 00:35:32,089
All right. Please bring in the multiple choices.

941
00:35:32,619 --> 00:35:33,949
- What are these? - Gosh.

942
00:35:33,949 --> 00:35:35,519
- We'll be all right. - Are those stockings?

943
00:35:35,819 --> 00:35:37,989
"Draw a hotel on my face."

944
00:35:37,989 --> 00:35:39,819
"Draw a hotel on my face"?

945
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:42,089
Team Ji Hyo.

946
00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:44,289
All right. We can do this.

947
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:48,389
Which of the following means "Where is the hotel" in Mongolian?

948
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:49,889
- Okay. - Yes.

949
00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:51,089
Number one.

950
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:54,189
(Which of the following means "Where is the hotel" in Mongolian?)

951
00:35:54,189 --> 00:35:55,819
(Well, I don't know this at all.)

952
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:56,919
Number two.

953
00:35:57,659 --> 00:35:59,289
(Which of the following means "Where is the hotel" in Mongolian?)

954
00:35:59,289 --> 00:36:00,489
- Does it mean we should lie down? - What?

955
00:36:00,489 --> 00:36:01,619
Number three.

956
00:36:02,089 --> 00:36:04,949
(Which of the following means "Where is the hotel" in Mongolian?)

957
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:06,919
- Bed! - She said, "bed".

958
00:36:06,919 --> 00:36:07,919
Number four.

959
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:09,949
(Which of the following means "Where is the hotel" in Mongolian?)

960
00:36:10,189 --> 00:36:12,919
- Two of them said, "lie down". - There were two of them.

961
00:36:12,919 --> 00:36:15,089
- It has to be one of those. - There were two choices.

962
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:20,749
(This was the second one.)

963
00:36:20,749 --> 00:36:22,919
(This was the fourth one.)

964
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:27,089
(Hotel means a place we lie down. That's the answer!)

965
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:28,289
- Don't you think so? - Aren't we right?

966
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:30,659
- There were two choices for that. - Mongolia and Korea are similar.

967
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:33,589
- We have Mongolian spots. - That's not relevant at all!

968
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:34,989
- Did you seriously say that? - We do.

969
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:36,589
My brother has a Mongolian spot too.

970
00:36:36,589 --> 00:36:38,449
Since we heard, "lie down", that has to be the answer.

971
00:36:38,449 --> 00:36:40,789
Let me explain this in a historical context.

972
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:42,949
Our culture doesn't use beds.

973
00:36:42,949 --> 00:36:44,589
- That's right. - We lie down on the floor.

974
00:36:44,589 --> 00:36:45,589
I've heard it from somewhere.

975
00:36:45,589 --> 00:36:47,119
- When she said, "lie down", - She said, "lie down".

976
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,689
- it's derived from our culture. - Can you elaborate on your claim?

977
00:36:50,189 --> 00:36:52,489
Even our elders say, "Hey, lie down."

978
00:36:52,489 --> 00:36:54,189
(Listen to me. Doesn't it sound exactly the same?)

979
00:36:54,189 --> 00:36:56,749
But you spoke with a heavy dialect from the Gyeongsang Province.

980
00:36:56,849 --> 00:36:58,319
- "Lie down." - The residents are from Mongolia.

981
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:00,119
- That's right. - Is that so?

982
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,219
It's between number 2 or 4.

983
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,289
I think it's number three.

984
00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:04,289
- What? - So Min, what do you think?

985
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,889
I think number two. The one with "lie down" is the answer.

986
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:08,589
- That was number two, right? - Yes.

987
00:37:08,589 --> 00:37:09,589
- Number 2? - But number 4 could be it too.

988
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:11,749
- Number 2 sounded more precise. - It's between number 2 or 4.

989
00:37:11,749 --> 00:37:13,449
Number two? That's great.

990
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:16,289
- Let's get ready. - The answer you chose...

991
00:37:16,289 --> 00:37:17,549
- The answer is number 3. - It's number 2.

992
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:20,419
(If they're wrong, they'll be penalized according to the option.)

993
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:21,549
Number two.

994
00:37:21,549 --> 00:37:23,659
(If they're wrong, they'll be penalized according to the option.)

995
00:37:24,049 --> 00:37:27,619
(They heard "lie down" in number 2.)

996
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:35,519
(Is their choice as logical as they think it is?)

997
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,489
"Put clothespins on my face."

998
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:38,789
We're ready.

999
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,719
- It was number three, right? - Yes.

1000
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:41,849
I knew it.

1001
00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:44,589
What do you mean "lie down"?

1002
00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:46,789
What were you talking about?

1003
00:37:46,789 --> 00:37:47,949
(We clearly heard it.)

1004
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:49,849
- Do they say "bed"? - I knew it was three.

1005
00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:51,119
Whom should I go for?

1006
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,249
- Each attacks one. - Okay.

1007
00:37:53,249 --> 00:37:54,319
Here we go.

1008
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:56,389
(Seok Jin gets a nose ring.)

1009
00:37:56,389 --> 00:37:57,449
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

1010
00:37:58,619 --> 00:37:59,719
It hurts.

1011
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:01,319
- What should I do? - I'll pick another place.

1012
00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:02,659
Gosh.

1013
00:38:03,689 --> 00:38:07,449
(This looks familiar.)

1014
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:11,119
(Do you remember this?)

1015
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:18,849
(Having clothespins on your eyelids hurts every time.)

1016
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:20,519
Jae Seok, lie down.

1017
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:23,219
- Lie down. - Lie down.

1018
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:26,449
(At Hotel Running Man, they even close your eyes.)

1019
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:32,819
(All this started from one sentence.)

1020
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:37,419
(Number 3 was the correct answer.)

1021
00:38:37,419 --> 00:38:39,489
It hurts so much.

1022
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:41,949
It's Team Russia's turn now.

1023
00:38:41,949 --> 00:38:43,049
Again?

1024
00:38:43,049 --> 00:38:44,619
- Please get ready. - Get ready.

1025
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:46,749
- It hurts so much. - Right?

1026
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:50,719
"Help me" in Russian.

1027
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:51,789
- "Help me?" - "Help me?"

1028
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:53,549
- "SOS"? - How do you say it?

1029
00:38:53,659 --> 00:38:54,749
One.

1030
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:58,849
(Pondering)

1031
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:00,219
Two.

1032
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:04,349
(Confused)

1033
00:39:04,489 --> 00:39:05,589
Three.

1034
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:10,019
Four.

1035
00:39:12,089 --> 00:39:13,089
I have no idea.

1036
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:15,489
It's so difficult.

1037
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:17,619
Kwang Soo, Se Chan, you don't have to listen, do you?

1038
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:19,489
(You don't have to listen, do you?)

1039
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:20,619
What?

1040
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:22,789
- Can't we listen one more time? - The thing is,

1041
00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:24,919
Jong Kook likes it when we look like we're thinking.

1042
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:28,019
- I am thinking. - He likes it when we do.

1043
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:29,919
- This is so difficult. - We should pretend.

1044
00:39:29,919 --> 00:39:31,889
They don't even have to listen.

1045
00:39:32,749 --> 00:39:34,119
- Let's go for number two. - Should we?

1046
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:35,219
- Let's do it. - Okay.

1047
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:37,449
- He listened to me. - I was thinking the same.

1048
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:40,019
Jong Kook listened to you guys for the first time in a long time.

1049
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:41,749
If it turns out to be wrong, he'll blame us.

1050
00:39:41,749 --> 00:39:42,949
- Exactly. - Let's go.

1051
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:45,089
The penalty can't be that bad. One, two, three.

1052
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:46,189
- 2. - 2!

1053
00:39:46,189 --> 00:39:48,159
Number two means...

1054
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:52,219
(It sounds so unfamiliar.)

1055
00:39:52,219 --> 00:39:55,289
(Was Kwang Soo's hunch right?)

1056
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:56,819
"Please pull my sideburns."

1057
00:39:56,819 --> 00:39:59,749
(It means "please pull my sideburns.")

1058
00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:02,319
The correct answer is number three, right?

1059
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:03,389
Yes.

1060
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:04,549
(Why did I trust Kwang Soo?)

1061
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:05,989
(It means "please pull my sideburns.")

1062
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:07,589
"Pull my sideburns."

1063
00:40:07,689 --> 00:40:10,249
Start from Kwang Soo.

1064
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:11,419
Go.

1065
00:40:11,419 --> 00:40:12,419
Harder.

1066
00:40:14,489 --> 00:40:15,589
Hey, hold on.

1067
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:18,549
- Stop. - It hurts, right?

1068
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:19,549
(It's fun. Let me go on.)

1069
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:20,549
Go on.

1070
00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:23,659
(Extreme pain)

1071
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,719
(You're crazy.)

1072
00:40:28,249 --> 00:40:30,689
So Min, good job.

1073
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,489
(Seok Jin pulls Jong Kook's sideburns.)

1074
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:34,489
- Hold on, what are you doing? - What?

1075
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:37,389
My sideburns... Can he do this?

1076
00:40:37,419 --> 00:40:39,049
You look like a Chinese doll.

1077
00:40:39,049 --> 00:40:40,349
(Jong Kook in pigtails)

1078
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:41,989
- Come on. - You look so cute.

1079
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:43,289
You look so cute.

1080
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:45,949
You look like a Chinese doll.

1081
00:40:46,049 --> 00:40:49,419
- I don't get to do this often. - What is this?

1082
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:50,789
Are they my sideburns?

1083
00:40:52,289 --> 00:40:54,419
(Seok Jin groans while pulling Jong Kook's hair.)

1084
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:56,719
Seok Jin, what are you doing?

1085
00:40:57,389 --> 00:40:58,619
He's afraid he'll be counter-attacked.

1086
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,319
He's not doing it properly.

1087
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:02,689
His hands don't go up.

1088
00:41:02,689 --> 00:41:04,449
- What are you doing? - They don't move.

1089
00:41:04,449 --> 00:41:06,019
What did you do?

1090
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:07,719
They're not my sideburns.

1091
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:09,589
He just pretended.

1092
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:11,549
Pull my sideburns.

1093
00:41:11,549 --> 00:41:14,419
I'll pretend I'm pulling it. You pretend it hurts.

1094
00:41:14,419 --> 00:41:16,519
(He whispers his plan to Jong Kook.)

1095
00:41:16,659 --> 00:41:17,989
- What is this? - This is not okay.

1096
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:20,319
- Come on. - Did you hear that?

1097
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,819
(Please pretend it hurts.)

1098
00:41:21,819 --> 00:41:22,989
He said, "Pretend it hurts."

1099
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,019
- Come on. - Just pull my sideburns.

1100
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:26,389
You just need to play along.

1101
00:41:26,549 --> 00:41:28,249
You can pull this.

1102
00:41:28,249 --> 00:41:29,489
Just play along.

1103
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:31,119
It's more fun that way.

1104
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,949
Ask someone else to do it. I'll do it for you.

1105
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:35,749
- Why would you? - I'll just get it done.

1106
00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:37,189
Why would you?

1107
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:38,489
My sideburns...

1108
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:39,989
(Determined)

1109
00:41:41,589 --> 00:41:43,549
Good job. That's great.

1110
00:41:44,089 --> 00:41:45,749
I just wanted to get it done.

1111
00:41:45,749 --> 00:41:47,419
- It's done now. - Great.

1112
00:41:47,419 --> 00:41:49,449
I just wanted to get it over with.

1113
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:52,719
- Good job. - I just wanted to get it done.

1114
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,949
- That's why. - Gosh, this is...

1115
00:41:54,989 --> 00:41:56,219
Jong Kook is angry.

1116
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:58,619
Thank you for helping me decide.

1117
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,419
- Kwang Soo will be sent to Japan. - Japan.

1118
00:42:00,549 --> 00:42:02,849
Exchange some money to Japanese yen beforehand.

1119
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:04,549
Get a Japanese conversation book.

1120
00:42:05,249 --> 00:42:08,719
(I have no regrets.)

1121
00:42:08,889 --> 00:42:10,049
It already starts to hurt.

1122
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:11,989
- Get a conversation book. - It already hurts.

1123
00:42:12,789 --> 00:42:14,389
(Screaming)

1124
00:42:14,819 --> 00:42:16,289
(Screaming)

1125
00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:17,689
It's not that bad.

1126
00:42:17,689 --> 00:42:19,489
(It's not that bad.)

1127
00:42:20,089 --> 00:42:21,219
Do it one more time.

1128
00:42:21,549 --> 00:42:22,919
Gosh.

1129
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:24,949
- Do it one more time. - I mean...

1130
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:26,249
- Gosh. - I mean...

1131
00:42:26,249 --> 00:42:27,819
He followed my hands.

1132
00:42:27,819 --> 00:42:29,189
I couldn't pull his hair.

1133
00:42:29,189 --> 00:42:30,349
What were you doing?

1134
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:31,989
(Was it funny?)

1135
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,849
Good job.

1136
00:42:33,849 --> 00:42:35,089
Okay.

1137
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:36,289
It counts.

1138
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:37,989
(The correct answer was number three.)

1139
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:39,289
It's our turn now.

1140
00:42:39,549 --> 00:42:40,889
Let's do this.

1141
00:42:41,189 --> 00:42:42,349
Give us some hints.

1142
00:42:42,349 --> 00:42:43,659
No, you shouldn't.

1143
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,049
The prize is the Biggest Chance Card.

1144
00:42:46,789 --> 00:42:48,349
It's the last question.

1145
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:50,589
(Who will win the Card?)

1146
00:42:50,589 --> 00:42:51,819
It's the same question.

1147
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:53,119
One.

1148
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,849
(How do you say, "Help me", in Mongolian?)

1149
00:42:55,849 --> 00:42:57,789
- It's not this one. - Two.

1150
00:43:00,049 --> 00:43:01,119
It's not this one either.

1151
00:43:01,549 --> 00:43:02,719
Three.

1152
00:43:04,689 --> 00:43:06,049
Please help me.

1153
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:07,289
Four.

1154
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:10,549
(Is it, "Help me?")

1155
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:11,949
- Number one sounded like, - Hold on.

1156
00:43:11,949 --> 00:43:14,289
- "Will you help me?" - What?

1157
00:43:14,289 --> 00:43:16,119
Number one sounded like, "Will you help me?"

1158
00:43:16,489 --> 00:43:17,819
It sounded like, "Will you help me?"

1159
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:19,589
She said, "Will you help me?"

1160
00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:20,749
(It sounded just like Korean.)

1161
00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:25,849
(This was number one.)

1162
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:28,659
(She said, "Will you help me?")

1163
00:43:28,659 --> 00:43:29,889
"Will you help me?"

1164
00:43:30,419 --> 00:43:32,919
- She has a different perspective. - I think it's number one too.

1165
00:43:32,989 --> 00:43:34,919
- You too? - Yes.

1166
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:37,719
- Seok Jin, what about you? - Number two.

1167
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:41,819
I'll go with Ji Hyo and So Min.

1168
00:43:42,689 --> 00:43:44,019
One, two, three.

1169
00:43:44,019 --> 00:43:45,189
- 1! - 2!

1170
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:46,319
- I think it's two. - What is it?

1171
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:47,389
You said different answers.

1172
00:43:47,389 --> 00:43:48,449
- It's 1. - It's 1.

1173
00:43:48,449 --> 00:43:50,289
Please set up a partition here.

1174
00:43:51,049 --> 00:43:52,249
Please divide us.

1175
00:43:52,249 --> 00:43:53,849
- He's not on our team. - I'm on my own.

1176
00:43:53,849 --> 00:43:55,489
- We need a partition. - I'm on my own.

1177
00:43:55,489 --> 00:43:56,519
Number one.

1178
00:43:57,219 --> 00:43:58,489
Let me announce the correct answer.

1179
00:43:58,489 --> 00:43:59,949
You chose number one.

1180
00:43:59,949 --> 00:44:01,049
(They chose number one.)

1181
00:44:01,489 --> 00:44:05,649
(So Min thinks she heard, "Will you help me?")

1182
00:44:05,649 --> 00:44:08,189
(Ji Hyo has a hunch that it's number one.)

1183
00:44:08,189 --> 00:44:11,549
(Are they right?)

1184
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:12,819
It means,

1185
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:15,089
"Please help me."

1186
00:44:15,089 --> 00:44:16,219
See?

1187
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:17,689
- Ji Hyo. - See?

1188
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:18,889
- See? - What about number two?

1189
00:44:19,149 --> 00:44:20,819
- It means, "Pinch my thighs." - "Will you help me?"

1190
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:22,049
Number one sounded a bit peculiar.

1191
00:44:22,049 --> 00:44:23,219
It could have been bad.

1192
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:24,319
How did you know?

1193
00:44:24,689 --> 00:44:26,089
I thought it was number four.

1194
00:44:27,449 --> 00:44:28,819
Team Ji Hyo wins.

1195
00:44:28,819 --> 00:44:30,349
(Team Ji Hyo wins Dangerous Quiz.)

1196
00:44:30,349 --> 00:44:31,989
(How are we going to catch king crabs?)

1197
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:32,989
I knew it.

1198
00:44:32,989 --> 00:44:34,519
Good job.

1199
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:36,519
(Team Ji Hyo wins the Card.)

1200
00:44:38,989 --> 00:44:41,819
(Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear, Japan)

1201
00:44:42,289 --> 00:44:44,749
(6 members are being sent on the Dangerous Trip.)

1202
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:47,649
(But 2 of them get a chance to be excluded.)

1203
00:44:47,649 --> 00:44:50,289
(What's the secret behind the Chance Card?)

1204
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:54,689
Please have photos taken for the visa before you go home.

1205
00:44:54,749 --> 00:44:56,789
My hair looks like this.

1206
00:44:56,919 --> 00:44:58,549
- What about me? - For the passport?

1207
00:44:58,549 --> 00:45:00,849
(He might be denied entry.)

1208
00:45:01,049 --> 00:45:04,649
(He even became an ambassador for the police.)

1209
00:45:04,789 --> 00:45:06,049
Is this a mission?

1210
00:45:06,989 --> 00:45:08,519
Will they let me enter the country?

1211
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:11,419
(His hair looks neater than before.)

1212
00:45:12,189 --> 00:45:13,219
Like this?

1213
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,619
I can't see your ears.

1214
00:45:15,289 --> 00:45:17,049
(Neat)

1215
00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:18,089
Like this?

1216
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:20,819
(More like this.)

1217
00:45:21,449 --> 00:45:24,189
(His hair looks neat now.)

1218
00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:26,489
Team Mongolia, see you next week.

1219
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:30,719
(All photos have been taken.)

1220
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:32,649
(A few days later)

1221
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:34,819
(The night before departure)

1222
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:36,249
Hello, I'm Se Chan.

1223
00:45:38,919 --> 00:45:40,589
Hello, I'm Se Chan.

1224
00:45:40,789 --> 00:45:45,119
We're leaving for Russia tomorrow.

1225
00:45:45,189 --> 00:45:46,689
To be honest,

1226
00:45:47,019 --> 00:45:49,989
I'm very excited.

1227
00:45:50,149 --> 00:45:54,719
I'm looking forward to our trip.

1228
00:45:54,819 --> 00:45:58,549
I don't think they'll be too strict about our mission.

1229
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:01,219
I'm not sure what I should pack.

1230
00:46:01,919 --> 00:46:03,049
Se Hyung.

1231
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:06,689
Se Hyung, I'm going to Russia.

1232
00:46:06,689 --> 00:46:08,319
You've been there.

1233
00:46:08,419 --> 00:46:10,619
(Se Hyung appears, looking natural.)

1234
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:11,989
What should I pack?

1235
00:46:11,989 --> 00:46:13,719
- What? - What should I pack?

1236
00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:18,749
(Se Hyung is familiar with Russia.)

1237
00:46:19,389 --> 00:46:20,719
- Is it an overnight trip? - Yes.

1238
00:46:21,389 --> 00:46:22,519
Just go.

1239
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:23,719
I don't have to bring anything?

1240
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:25,119
- What? - Isn't it cold there?

1241
00:46:25,589 --> 00:46:27,319
Will I need my winter jacket?

1242
00:46:27,949 --> 00:46:30,519
(Are you filming?)

1243
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:34,119
(How does my bare face look?)

1244
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:36,219
Do I need my winter jacket or not?

1245
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:38,119
Warm underclothes,

1246
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:39,389
- gloves, - Gloves.

1247
00:46:39,389 --> 00:46:40,719
- and thick socks. - Gloves?

1248
00:46:40,919 --> 00:46:42,719
Bring them.

1249
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:44,349
(Gloves in the summer?)

1250
00:46:46,689 --> 00:46:50,919
(His gloves become his lifesaver later.)

1251
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:52,749
(Heating pads)

1252
00:46:52,749 --> 00:46:53,919
What are they?

1253
00:46:54,749 --> 00:46:55,849
Are they heating pads?

1254
00:46:55,919 --> 00:46:58,749
(Thank you, Se Chan.)

1255
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:00,219
Heating pads.

1256
00:47:00,749 --> 00:47:02,189
- That'll do. - Okay.

1257
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,919
If it's cold, get some more there.

1258
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:05,489
All right.

1259
00:47:06,919 --> 00:47:08,089
What time is it?

1260
00:47:08,089 --> 00:47:10,649
(It's already 12:30am.)

1261
00:47:10,649 --> 00:47:14,119
(There's another person who is packing.)

1262
00:47:14,189 --> 00:47:15,349
Is it working?

1263
00:47:16,489 --> 00:47:17,619
Gosh.

1264
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:19,149
I can see myself.

1265
00:47:19,749 --> 00:47:22,219
(You can only see her eyes and forehead.)

1266
00:47:22,219 --> 00:47:23,749
How do I do it? Wait.

1267
00:47:24,949 --> 00:47:27,149
I have to pack my things.

1268
00:47:27,749 --> 00:47:30,119
I'm not sure what to pack.

1269
00:47:31,089 --> 00:47:34,149
(She packs a thick jacket in case it gets cold at night.)

1270
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:36,019
I packed some cup noodles.

1271
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:39,249
I also packed really delicious dried laver...

1272
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:40,789
and nurungji.

1273
00:47:41,089 --> 00:47:42,789
These are eye masks for sleeping.

1274
00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:47,119
(She packs cup noodles, nurungji, cute eye masks,)

1275
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,249
(facial masks to share with Ji Hyo, bug repellent,)

1276
00:47:49,249 --> 00:47:51,119
(and heat packs.)

1277
00:47:51,989 --> 00:47:53,989
I heard that there are no bathrooms...

1278
00:47:53,989 --> 00:47:55,619
where we'll be.

1279
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:58,089
We have to go somewhere in the grassland.

1280
00:47:58,389 --> 00:48:00,689
(She feels embarrassed.)

1281
00:48:00,689 --> 00:48:03,389
There is no separate bathroom.

1282
00:48:04,819 --> 00:48:07,689
In case I can't wash my face,

1283
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:09,619
I packed wet tissues.

1284
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:11,849
I bought them.

1285
00:48:12,449 --> 00:48:15,189
I heard the children in Mongolia love hairpins.

1286
00:48:15,189 --> 00:48:17,619
I went to Jeonju recently.

1287
00:48:18,189 --> 00:48:22,389
They were selling heart and dragonfly-shaped hairpins.

1288
00:48:22,389 --> 00:48:24,019
I bought some.

1289
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:25,549
It's a heart-shaped one.

1290
00:48:25,549 --> 00:48:27,289
(She has a heart-shaped one.)

1291
00:48:27,289 --> 00:48:28,319
It's a dragonfly.

1292
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:29,989
(She also has a dragonfly-shaped one.)

1293
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:31,749
(She plans to bring them.)

1294
00:48:31,749 --> 00:48:33,219
Can you see it?

1295
00:48:35,189 --> 00:48:36,249
Hairpin?

1296
00:48:36,689 --> 00:48:38,149
She's so cute.

1297
00:48:38,149 --> 00:48:40,349
(She gives a big present to a child in the grassland.)

1298
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:44,189
Is the suitcase too big for the amount?

1299
00:48:44,189 --> 00:48:47,489
(It's big enough to fit a person.)

1300
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:48,519
Is it too big?

1301
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:50,389
(An ordinary suitcase would've been fine.)

1302
00:48:50,389 --> 00:48:53,219
It's better to take a big suitcase.

1303
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,249
I feel excited.

1304
00:48:56,049 --> 00:48:57,689
What I'm excited about the most...

1305
00:48:57,689 --> 00:49:02,519
is the beautiful, night sky in Mongolia.

1306
00:49:03,689 --> 00:49:05,449
(So Min is excited...)

1307
00:49:05,449 --> 00:49:10,349
(about the beautiful, night sky in Mongolia.)

1308
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:14,819
(She watches the shooting stars with other members.)

1309
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:19,689
(They spend time together under the Great Bear.)

1310
00:49:20,189 --> 00:49:21,419
See you in Mongolia.

1311
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:24,549
Goodnight.

1312
00:49:24,549 --> 00:49:30,189
(Their trip to Russia and Mongolia is coming up next.)

1313
00:49:33,219 --> 00:49:38,649
(On the day of their departure at Incheon International Airport)

1314
00:49:38,919 --> 00:49:40,489
I thought about this last night while packing.

1315
00:49:40,489 --> 00:49:43,189
"Why do I need to go to Mongolia?"

1316
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:45,289
What's the purpose?

1317
00:49:45,389 --> 00:49:47,389
If you clear the mission successfully,

1318
00:49:47,389 --> 00:49:49,749
two members whom Ji Hyo selects...

1319
00:49:49,749 --> 00:49:51,319
- That's right. - will be exempted.

1320
00:49:51,319 --> 00:49:53,219
That's my only hope.

1321
00:49:53,219 --> 00:49:54,719
Honestly.

1322
00:49:55,649 --> 00:49:57,019
Here comes Seok Jin.

1323
00:49:57,819 --> 00:49:58,949
I'm going to Mongolia.

1324
00:49:59,189 --> 00:50:00,449
To Ulaanbaatar.

1325
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,019
The weather is beautiful.

1326
00:50:03,789 --> 00:50:04,889
Seok Jin.

1327
00:50:05,619 --> 00:50:07,149
You're necessary for the trip.

1328
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:08,789
Hello, Jae Seok.

1329
00:50:08,919 --> 00:50:10,919
Why are you wearing makeup?

1330
00:50:10,919 --> 00:50:12,319
- Are you not? - Of course not.

1331
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,419
You should feel free when you travel.

1332
00:50:14,419 --> 00:50:16,049
That's not proper for the camera.

1333
00:50:16,049 --> 00:50:17,189
What?

1334
00:50:17,189 --> 00:50:20,249
That's a big suitcase for a two-night trip.

1335
00:50:20,249 --> 00:50:21,349
(It's because...)

1336
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:23,389
(I'm precious.)

1337
00:50:23,389 --> 00:50:24,649
Did you bring a long jacket?

1338
00:50:24,649 --> 00:50:25,819
Why would I?

1339
00:50:25,819 --> 00:50:26,849
I heard it's cold.

1340
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:28,349
- What's wrong with him? - I heard it's freezing.

1341
00:50:28,349 --> 00:50:29,689
I heard it's freezing.

1342
00:50:29,689 --> 00:50:32,019
The temperature falls below zero at night.

1343
00:50:32,019 --> 00:50:33,019
What's going on?

1344
00:50:33,019 --> 00:50:34,019
(The leader comes with a backpack.)

1345
00:50:34,019 --> 00:50:36,049
- Why did you bring a suitcase? - Here's the team leader.

1346
00:50:36,049 --> 00:50:37,119
Hello, Team Leader.

1347
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,819
You didn't bring anything.

1348
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:41,289
What do you mean? Everything is in here.

1349
00:50:41,449 --> 00:50:42,989
The trip is only for two nights.

1350
00:50:42,989 --> 00:50:44,419
What did you pack?

1351
00:50:44,449 --> 00:50:46,219
- Ji Hyo. - Did you pack kimchi?

1352
00:50:46,219 --> 00:50:47,689
Did you bring kimchi?

1353
00:50:47,689 --> 00:50:49,119
There's no suitcase like that.

1354
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,689
I didn't know what I would need.

1355
00:50:51,689 --> 00:50:53,919
- Jae Seok, what's this? - Jae Seok.

1356
00:50:53,919 --> 00:50:56,949
- It looks so tacky. - I might lose my suitcase.

1357
00:50:57,219 --> 00:50:59,619
- It's really tacky. - There are many suitcases like it.

1358
00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:01,619
- Goodness. - It's tacky.

1359
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:03,649
- I don't want to lose my suitcase. - Is that why?

1360
00:51:03,649 --> 00:51:04,889
- Let it go. - Write your name on it.

1361
00:51:04,889 --> 00:51:06,389
- Seok Jin. - Do you have a marker?

1362
00:51:06,389 --> 00:51:08,019
A suitcase like yours...

1363
00:51:08,019 --> 00:51:10,149
- will be okay. - Yours is tacky too.

1364
00:51:10,149 --> 00:51:12,019
- What's this green thing? - Look at that.

1365
00:51:12,649 --> 00:51:13,689
(A bigger suitcase approaches.)

1366
00:51:13,689 --> 00:51:15,019
Did I pack too much?

1367
00:51:15,549 --> 00:51:16,849
I should hurry.

1368
00:51:17,389 --> 00:51:18,619
Hello.

1369
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:19,819
Hello, So Min.

1370
00:51:19,819 --> 00:51:22,189
(What is that?)

1371
00:51:22,189 --> 00:51:24,489
(It's a huge suitcase.)

1372
00:51:24,489 --> 00:51:25,789
- Hello. - So Min.

1373
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:27,319
- Hello. - What's that?

1374
00:51:27,419 --> 00:51:30,219
Did you pack a person inside?

1375
00:51:30,219 --> 00:51:31,689
Are you moving abroad?

1376
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:33,549
- She's moving. - Are you opening up a business?

1377
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:35,289
Mine is for three days.

1378
00:51:35,289 --> 00:51:36,919
His is for five days to a week.

1379
00:51:37,049 --> 00:51:38,689
Yours is for over 15 days.

1380
00:51:38,689 --> 00:51:40,889
Mine is enough to stay in Mongolia for a month.

1381
00:51:40,949 --> 00:51:42,489
- Look at Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo.

1382
00:51:42,649 --> 00:51:44,989
She will come back after dropping us off.

1383
00:51:45,389 --> 00:51:47,149
- After she drops us off, - Is she a tour guide?

1384
00:51:47,149 --> 00:51:48,489
- Ji Hyo will... - Is she a tour guide?

1385
00:51:49,049 --> 00:51:50,789
- Did you call me a tour guide? - Yes.

1386
00:51:50,789 --> 00:51:52,119
I'm the team leader.

1387
00:51:52,119 --> 00:51:54,049
- I'm sorry. - I have No Tour Cards.

1388
00:51:54,049 --> 00:51:55,289
Ji Hyo made her decision.

1389
00:51:55,289 --> 00:51:56,819
I already decided.

1390
00:51:56,819 --> 00:51:59,449
Ji Hyo, put your backpack in here.

1391
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,589
No, it's okay.

1392
00:52:00,849 --> 00:52:03,619
(Will Team Ji Hyo clear the mission without trouble?)

1393
00:52:04,349 --> 00:52:07,919
(Team Jong Kook must catch king crab.)

1394
00:52:07,919 --> 00:52:09,749
- You're coming too. - Right.

1395
00:52:09,749 --> 00:52:11,749
I didn't know I'd go to Russia.

1396
00:52:12,189 --> 00:52:13,749
- You're going to Russia. - I know.

1397
00:52:13,749 --> 00:52:16,189
(They're going to Russia but...)

1398
00:52:16,189 --> 00:52:18,519
Are you going there with shorts?

1399
00:52:18,849 --> 00:52:20,119
- It's for the flight. - It's cold there.

1400
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:22,289
I wanted to be comfortable during the flight.

1401
00:52:22,289 --> 00:52:23,349
- Really? - Yes.

1402
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,419
I thought...

1403
00:52:24,419 --> 00:52:26,719
Since you're obsessed with wearing shorts...

1404
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:28,749
I thought you were wearing them for Russia.

1405
00:52:29,049 --> 00:52:30,489
I like to wear shorts,

1406
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:33,089
but I want to see how cold it is.

1407
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:36,919
- Will you be okay? - I want to see how cold it is.

1408
00:52:36,919 --> 00:52:38,489
- Someone is coming. - What's that?

1409
00:52:39,649 --> 00:52:40,719
- Is it Kwang Soo? - He has a strange hairdo.

1410
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:42,319
Hello, Haha.

1411
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,019
- Hello. - Hello.

1412
00:52:44,849 --> 00:52:46,849
If you wear shorts, you'll die there.

1413
00:52:47,349 --> 00:52:49,049
(His shorts are hard to miss.)

1414
00:52:49,049 --> 00:52:50,119
I told him already.

1415
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:52,349
It's raining and snowing over there.

1416
00:52:52,489 --> 00:52:54,719
- For now, - No, you'll freeze.

1417
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:56,219
I'll keep them on.

1418
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:58,089
- He loves shorts so much. - I'll see.

1419
00:52:58,249 --> 00:53:00,149
- He doesn't like being stylish. - Hello.

1420
00:53:00,289 --> 00:53:01,849
- Hello. - Hello, Kwang Soo.

1421
00:53:01,889 --> 00:53:04,619
I looked up some information about Russia.

1422
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:06,219
There's a place we must go.

1423
00:53:06,219 --> 00:53:07,919
- Where? - We must go to a maritime park.

1424
00:53:07,919 --> 00:53:09,219
Will you be our tour guide?

1425
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:11,819
- Yes, I will. - That suits you well.

1426
00:53:12,219 --> 00:53:14,349
(He speaks Russian.)

1427
00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:15,549
(The tour starts with learning the language.)

1428
00:53:15,549 --> 00:53:16,719
- Do you know what it means? - Yes.

1429
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:18,289
What does it mean?

1430
00:53:18,289 --> 00:53:19,349
- Hello. - Excuse me.

1431
00:53:19,349 --> 00:53:20,819
It means hello.

1432
00:53:22,289 --> 00:53:23,949
(It means hello in Russian.)

1433
00:53:23,949 --> 00:53:25,119
It means hello.

1434
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,789
- Thank you. - Okay.

1435
00:53:27,789 --> 00:53:29,249
(What did you say?)

1436
00:53:29,249 --> 00:53:30,249
- It means... - Listen.

1437
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:31,949
Don't say that to us.

1438
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:33,549
- Okay. - He's prepared.

1439
00:53:33,549 --> 00:53:34,789
Say it only to Russians.

1440
00:53:34,789 --> 00:53:36,549
Don't say that to us. We may misunderstand.

1441
00:53:36,989 --> 00:53:39,119
- Thank you. - He's prepared.

1442
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:40,589
Let's go to the maritime park.

1443
00:53:40,589 --> 00:53:42,749
Then let's figure out the rest.

1444
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:45,589
- How? - We have to ask them...

1445
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:48,119
- where we can find crab. - Do we have to ask?

1446
00:53:48,189 --> 00:53:50,219
- Who else would ask? - You should prepare beforehand.

1447
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:51,319
- Ask me the question. - Pardon me?

1448
00:53:51,389 --> 00:53:52,689
- Ask me. - Ask where we can find crab.

1449
00:53:52,689 --> 00:53:53,719
(Here's another phrase.)

1450
00:53:54,589 --> 00:53:55,919
What did he say?

1451
00:53:56,919 --> 00:53:57,919
What does that mean?

1452
00:53:57,919 --> 00:54:00,949
(What did he say in Russian?)

1453
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:02,549
"Please help me."

1454
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:04,219
What does it mean?

1455
00:54:04,219 --> 00:54:05,219
I only know that.

1456
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:06,289
We must know this phrase.

1457
00:54:06,289 --> 00:54:07,949
We must remember this phrase.

1458
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:08,949
- Se Chan. - What is it?

1459
00:54:08,949 --> 00:54:11,049
(Do not forget this word.)

1460
00:54:11,049 --> 00:54:12,949
If we fall in the water while catching crab,

1461
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:16,589
say, "Please help me!"

1462
00:54:16,589 --> 00:54:18,219
We must say that.

1463
00:54:18,219 --> 00:54:20,489
We'll say thank you when we fall in the water.

1464
00:54:23,919 --> 00:54:25,749
(Thank you.)

1465
00:54:26,489 --> 00:54:29,289
What do we have to do once we arrive?

1466
00:54:29,289 --> 00:54:31,219
- We'll go to the maritime park. - The maritime park?

1467
00:54:31,219 --> 00:54:32,919
They sell seafood.

1468
00:54:32,919 --> 00:54:34,119
Our mission is...

1469
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:35,619
to find king crab, right?

1470
00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:37,089
Why don't you look at Jong Kook?

1471
00:54:37,749 --> 00:54:39,189
You keep...

1472
00:54:39,249 --> 00:54:41,349
- avoiding my eyes. - He doesn't look at him.

1473
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:42,689
He's scary.

1474
00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:43,989
Do you want to go to Japan?

1475
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,789
- No way. - Don't do that.

1476
00:54:45,789 --> 00:54:47,919
- You should look at me. - I'm very sorry.

1477
00:54:47,919 --> 00:54:50,589
He responded to us when Jong Kook asked.

1478
00:54:50,589 --> 00:54:52,019
Didn't you learn...

1479
00:54:52,019 --> 00:54:53,549
to look at the adults when answering?

1480
00:54:53,549 --> 00:54:54,719
- I should look. - Right?

1481
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,089
It's because your eyes are small.

1482
00:54:57,089 --> 00:54:59,019
(It's because...)

1483
00:54:59,019 --> 00:55:01,149
(your eyes...)

1484
00:55:01,149 --> 00:55:03,189
(are small.)

1485
00:55:03,189 --> 00:55:05,119
I'm really sorry, Jong Kook.

1486
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:07,249
(Se Chan upsets him.)

1487
00:55:07,249 --> 00:55:08,589
I haven't heard it in a while.

1488
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:11,419
- It's been a long time. - I made a mistake.

1489
00:55:11,419 --> 00:55:12,849
(Se Chan is out of the picture.)

1490
00:55:12,849 --> 00:55:14,319
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1491
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:15,919
- Are we really going to Russia? - To Russia.

1492
00:55:15,989 --> 00:55:18,249
Let's go to Russia.

1493
00:55:18,249 --> 00:55:21,119
(How will their trip turn out?)

1494
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:24,919
You had mutton last week. Now, you're going to Mongolia.

1495
00:55:24,919 --> 00:55:27,049
I'm so excited.

1496
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,189
If you meet a nomad and milk their sheep,

1497
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:32,289
you'll clear the mission.

1498
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:35,089
If you clear the mission while the other team fails,

1499
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:37,619
two members will be exempted from the Dangerous Tour.

1500
00:55:38,189 --> 00:55:40,549
Is this notepad for me?

1501
00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:41,989
It's a type of blacklist.

1502
00:55:43,319 --> 00:55:45,789
(Once your name is written on it,)

1503
00:55:45,789 --> 00:55:47,489
(you'll be in trouble.)

1504
00:55:47,489 --> 00:55:48,889
It's a blacklist.

1505
00:55:49,589 --> 00:55:51,889
I'll take a peek later.

1506
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:53,289
- You will? - Goodness.

1507
00:55:53,489 --> 00:55:54,889
Write So Min's name.

1508
00:55:54,889 --> 00:55:56,289
Write her name down.

1509
00:55:56,289 --> 00:55:57,689
- I know you will. - I'll deduct half from So Min.

1510
00:55:57,689 --> 00:55:59,419
- Write her name down. - I'll deduct half a point.

1511
00:55:59,419 --> 00:56:00,449
Your thoughts...

1512
00:56:00,449 --> 00:56:02,819
make us speechless.

1513
00:56:03,189 --> 00:56:05,519
She's always deceitful.

1514
00:56:05,749 --> 00:56:08,019
You're dumb and out of it.

1515
00:56:08,019 --> 00:56:09,189
- "Dumb and out of it"? - You're like sisters.

1516
00:56:09,249 --> 00:56:11,349
- What do you mean? - You're out of it, and she's dumb.

1517
00:56:11,719 --> 00:56:12,749
Goodness.

1518
00:56:12,749 --> 00:56:15,149
- They're like a team. - Dumb and out of it.

1519
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:19,519
(Ji Hyo becomes aggressive again...)

1520
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:23,849
(and blames the clueless So Min.)

1521
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:28,489
(When So Min makes silly comments,)

1522
00:56:28,489 --> 00:56:31,949
(Ji Hyo explodes in anger.)

1523
00:56:33,619 --> 00:56:38,749
(So Min who's happy-go-lucky...)

1524
00:56:38,749 --> 00:56:41,789
(makes Ji Hyo lose her temper.)

1525
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:47,019
(Banging)

1526
00:56:47,019 --> 00:56:49,619
(Are you okay, So Min?)

1527
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:55,919
(They take care of each other at times.)

1528
00:56:57,619 --> 00:56:59,649
What should we do with them?

1529
00:56:59,919 --> 00:57:02,949
Let's go and get your plane tickets.

1530
00:57:02,949 --> 00:57:06,019
There's always someone who didn't bring their passport.

1531
00:57:06,019 --> 00:57:07,619
Come here, So Min.

1532
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:10,749
(Team Ji Hyo and Team Jong Kook...)

1533
00:57:10,749 --> 00:57:12,589
(enter the airport.)

1534
00:57:12,589 --> 00:57:14,249
- We're really going. - This is the airport.

1535
00:57:14,249 --> 00:57:15,789
I can't believe it.

1536
00:57:15,789 --> 00:57:18,119
- Where should we go? - We leave once we enter the gate.

1537
00:57:18,589 --> 00:57:19,919
We leave once we enter the gate.

1538
00:57:19,919 --> 00:57:21,589
(They're really going to Russia.)

1539
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:24,719
I'm so happy that I'm going to Mongolia.

1540
00:57:24,849 --> 00:57:26,889
It's my first time.

1541
00:57:27,889 --> 00:57:29,889
Hey, Ji Hyo. Ma'am.

1542
00:57:29,889 --> 00:57:31,749
- Yes? - Will you cross out if we do well?

1543
00:57:31,749 --> 00:57:33,149
- Sure. - Okay.

1544
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:35,249
Just buy a flight ticket to Japan while you're here.

1545
00:57:35,249 --> 00:57:38,119
I can't go there. You can't send me there.

1546
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:39,149
Did you see the blog?

1547
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:41,889
Did you see what's written about that mysterious case in that blog?

1548
00:57:41,889 --> 00:57:43,289
(Do you mean the Labyrinth of Fear?)

1549
00:57:43,289 --> 00:57:44,789
- Mysterious case? - It's the Labyrinth of Fear.

1550
00:57:44,789 --> 00:57:46,589
You understood, so it's fine.

1551
00:57:47,189 --> 00:57:49,589
It's strange we understood you.

1552
00:57:49,589 --> 00:57:50,589
- Right? - Yes.

1553
00:57:50,589 --> 00:57:53,189
- You get it all. - Even if you say it wrong...

1554
00:57:53,189 --> 00:57:55,649
It's the same when it comes to you.

1555
00:57:57,049 --> 00:57:58,389
(Don't say it like you're not the case.)

1556
00:57:58,389 --> 00:57:59,819
Do you think you say things clearly?

1557
00:58:00,149 --> 00:58:01,789
It's hard understanding her point.

1558
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:03,619
- Ms. Chun Soo Yeon. - I have no bags.

1559
00:58:03,619 --> 00:58:04,619
- You don't? - No.

1560
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:06,019
Who is Chun Soo Yeon?

1561
00:58:06,849 --> 00:58:08,389
Your real name is Chun Soo Yeon?

1562
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:11,049
- That's my real name. - It's not Chun Sung Im?

1563
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:13,219
I guess you changed your name to Soo Yeon.

1564
00:58:13,249 --> 00:58:14,749
Yes, I changed it since too many people recognized it.

1565
00:58:14,749 --> 00:58:15,749
I see.

1566
00:58:15,789 --> 00:58:17,749
Jae Seok was blabbering my name to everyone.

1567
00:58:17,749 --> 00:58:19,589
He kept on calling me Sung Im.

1568
00:58:19,589 --> 00:58:20,889
That's funny.

1569
00:58:20,889 --> 00:58:22,949
- It was Chun Sung Im. - I wondered who Soo Yeon was.

1570
00:58:22,949 --> 00:58:25,189
I was surprised too.

1571
00:58:25,189 --> 00:58:27,389
Your name sounds very modest.

1572
00:58:27,389 --> 00:58:30,349
Okay, so you be quiet.

1573
00:58:30,519 --> 00:58:32,419
- I don't want to change it again. - Soo Yeon.

1574
00:58:32,419 --> 00:58:34,249
Write this on your note.

1575
00:58:34,249 --> 00:58:36,449
You look like an informant or something.

1576
00:58:36,449 --> 00:58:38,749
- Why? - You have so many names.

1577
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:40,089
Chun Sung Im, Chun Soo Yeon, and Song Ji Hyo.

1578
00:58:40,089 --> 00:58:42,219
Should I write it down? Jae Seok?

1579
00:58:42,789 --> 00:58:45,189
- Well... - This is worth writing.

1580
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:46,189
Jee...

1581
00:58:47,289 --> 00:58:48,289
Why me?

1582
00:58:48,289 --> 00:58:49,289
(But I'm loyal to you!)

1583
00:58:49,289 --> 00:58:51,849
- I wrote your name four times now. - Seriously?

1584
00:58:51,849 --> 00:58:53,589
- You should write his name instead. - That was strange.

1585
00:58:53,589 --> 00:58:54,749
Don't touch my note.

1586
00:58:54,749 --> 00:58:56,049
Chun Soo Yeon was hilarious.

1587
00:58:56,049 --> 00:58:58,049
- I wondered who that was. - He says it's hilarious.

1588
00:58:58,689 --> 00:59:01,249
Don't you feel a little...

1589
00:59:01,249 --> 00:59:05,049
(Don't you think his remark is a little...)

1590
00:59:05,049 --> 00:59:06,819
It was nice, right?

1591
00:59:06,889 --> 00:59:08,549
I was just asking. Okay.

1592
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:10,549
- Did you just see? - What?

1593
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:11,719
(He didn't want to upset the team leader.)

1594
00:59:12,689 --> 00:59:15,319
- Okay. - That was a nice try.

1595
00:59:15,949 --> 00:59:17,249
- That was funny. - Why...

1596
00:59:17,249 --> 00:59:18,289
I almost cried.

1597
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:19,949
(Staggering)

1598
00:59:19,949 --> 00:59:21,989
Stay focused, will you?

1599
00:59:21,989 --> 00:59:23,749
You almost became luggage.

1600
00:59:23,989 --> 00:59:25,449
Thank you.

1601
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:27,449
(They excitedly depart to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.)

1602
00:59:27,749 --> 00:59:29,749
- Let's go! - Let's go.

1603
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:35,349
(How far have you been to explore the world?)

1604
00:59:36,349 --> 00:59:37,849
(Getting along so well)

1605
00:59:38,989 --> 00:59:41,319
(The female members are busy with their chitchat.)

1606
00:59:42,219 --> 00:59:45,089
(The middle-aged men are very different.)

1607
00:59:45,419 --> 00:59:47,849
(While they're crossing the wide desert,)

1608
00:59:48,189 --> 00:59:52,419
(Jong Kook's lackeys are busy trying to survive.)

1609
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:54,119
(Scuttling)

1610
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:55,849
- Is it not uncomfortable? - It's okay.

1611
00:59:56,849 --> 00:59:58,349
(Have this.)

1612
00:59:58,349 --> 00:59:59,649
- Thank you in advance. - All right.

1613
01:00:01,189 --> 01:00:02,489
(That young punk!)

1614
01:00:03,949 --> 01:00:07,589
(It's me, your right arm, Kwang Soo.)

1615
01:00:09,319 --> 01:00:10,389
(Hurting)

1616
01:00:10,389 --> 01:00:11,849
(Unpleasant)

1617
01:00:12,349 --> 01:00:14,089
(Kwang Soo, you're out.)

1618
01:00:14,089 --> 01:00:15,089
What?

1619
01:00:15,789 --> 01:00:17,089
Did you just tell me to get lost?

1620
01:00:17,789 --> 01:00:18,949
Have a great rest.

1621
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:21,089
- I'll visit you later. - I love peanuts.

1622
01:00:21,349 --> 01:00:22,719
- Thank you. - No problem.

1623
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,619
He doesn't eat food that has sugar on top.

1624
01:00:24,619 --> 01:00:26,989
- He doesn't eat sugar. - I was just taking care of him.

1625
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:28,589
(It's my careful heart to you.)

1626
01:00:28,589 --> 01:00:29,989
- I'll see you later. - Bye.

1627
01:00:31,749 --> 01:00:33,489
You're annoying.

1628
01:00:36,749 --> 01:00:39,149
(He's opening the peanut bag after losing to Se Chan.)

1629
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:44,949
(Is his plan to serve Jong Kook the peanuts?)

1630
01:00:44,949 --> 01:00:47,089
(Not a chance)

1631
01:00:47,089 --> 01:00:50,789
(I'm Lee Kwang Soo, and I like peanuts very much.)

1632
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:55,049
(He's eating like Ha Jung Woo.)

1633
01:00:58,419 --> 01:01:01,849
(Did you enjoy the peanuts?)

1634
01:01:02,649 --> 01:01:05,489
(Laughing)

1635
01:01:07,019 --> 01:01:09,749
(You're dying to visit the Labyrinth, aren't you?)

1636
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,819
Why did you eat my peanuts?

1637
01:01:12,589 --> 01:01:15,089
- Sorry. - Why did you steal them?

1638
01:01:16,889 --> 01:01:20,489
(They almost flew back to Korea before even arriving.)

1639
01:01:21,689 --> 01:01:26,289
(30 minutes after the peanut incident)

1640
01:01:26,289 --> 01:01:32,389
(They have successfully landed on Vladivostok, Russia.)

1641
01:01:33,789 --> 01:01:36,589
(They arrive at the Vladivostok International Airport at 1pm.)

1642
01:01:36,589 --> 01:01:37,819
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1643
01:01:38,819 --> 01:01:40,489
(Hello, Russia.)

1644
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:41,489
Nice.

1645
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,749
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1646
01:01:43,749 --> 01:01:44,949
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1647
01:01:44,949 --> 01:01:47,749
(Hello, Running Man!)

1648
01:01:48,219 --> 01:01:49,989
(People are gathering because of the members.)

1649
01:01:49,989 --> 01:01:51,419
- I'm so thankful. - Guys, come here.

1650
01:01:51,419 --> 01:01:53,549
- The weather is so nice. - Running Man!

1651
01:01:53,649 --> 01:01:57,189
(People are gathered at Chinggis Khaan International Airport too.)

1652
01:01:57,189 --> 01:01:59,849
(They're surprised to see people welcome them.)

1653
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:02,189
They're here to welcome us.

1654
01:02:02,189 --> 01:02:04,219
(Welcome, Running Man!)

1655
01:02:04,219 --> 01:02:06,419
My goodness. Hello!

1656
01:02:06,419 --> 01:02:07,949
Ji Hyo!

1657
01:02:08,389 --> 01:02:10,349
Sorry. We're passing through.

1658
01:02:10,349 --> 01:02:11,349
(They're careful.)

1659
01:02:11,349 --> 01:02:13,889
Look this way, please!

1660
01:02:13,889 --> 01:02:14,889
This way!

1661
01:02:14,889 --> 01:02:17,689
- Excuse me. - Love you!

1662
01:02:17,689 --> 01:02:21,349
(They decided not to shoot at the airport due to everyone's safety.)

1663
01:02:21,349 --> 01:02:23,349
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

1664
01:02:23,349 --> 01:02:24,749
- The luggage first. - Yes, the luggage.

1665
01:02:24,749 --> 01:02:25,949
Thank you.

1666
01:02:26,049 --> 01:02:28,289
Where is Seok Jin?

1667
01:02:28,689 --> 01:02:32,749
(He's apart from the members, outside the guard.)

1668
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:35,149
You all know the reason why we're here, right?

1669
01:02:35,149 --> 01:02:36,149
- Yes. - We do.

1670
01:02:36,149 --> 01:02:37,789
- We came to milk sheep. - That's one,

1671
01:02:37,789 --> 01:02:39,949
but we came to be exempted from the penalty.

1672
01:02:39,949 --> 01:02:42,049
- Right. - To be chosen by Ji Hyo.

1673
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:43,289
- Again? - My gosh!

1674
01:02:43,689 --> 01:02:44,719
- Gosh. - What is this again?

1675
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,619
- Do we throw a shoe again? - This is driving me crazy.

1676
01:02:47,619 --> 01:02:50,419
It won't go as we want because it's so windy today.

1677
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:52,449
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1678
01:02:52,449 --> 01:02:53,449
(Are they doing the shoe throw again?)

1679
01:02:54,568 --> 01:02:56,468
Here's your mission.

1680
01:02:56,838 --> 01:02:59,738
Like we told you, you must catch king crab.

1681
01:02:59,738 --> 01:03:03,508
Along with it, you have to throw a shoe on the mission board...

1682
01:03:03,608 --> 01:03:05,208
- that has 9 missions on it... - 9 missions?

1683
01:03:05,308 --> 01:03:07,568
and clear the mission you picked.

1684
01:03:08,108 --> 01:03:09,568
- It's the Shoe Throw. - That.

1685
01:03:09,568 --> 01:03:11,938
(Shoe Throw)

1686
01:03:11,938 --> 01:03:13,938
- I remember this. - We did this before.

1687
01:03:13,938 --> 01:03:15,808
- I remember it too. - I did it in Jeju Island.

1688
01:03:15,808 --> 01:03:18,208
- But the missions are different. - It's tough.

1689
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:20,708
(They reveal the upgraded mission board.)

1690
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:22,938
- You can't catch that. - "1m-long king crab"?

1691
01:03:22,968 --> 01:03:26,108
- Does it even exist? - It'll be as big as that board.

1692
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:28,008
It'll be about this size.

1693
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:29,468
It'll be same as that picture.

1694
01:03:29,938 --> 01:03:31,008
What about pollack?

1695
01:03:31,008 --> 01:03:33,408
We have to catch a pollack as well as a king crab...

1696
01:03:33,408 --> 01:03:34,508
if we throw a shoe in that box.

1697
01:03:34,508 --> 01:03:35,808
"10 kinds of fish"?

1698
01:03:35,808 --> 01:03:39,408
That means we have to catch a dolphin too.

1699
01:03:39,408 --> 01:03:41,768
Whatever the mission will be, it won't be easy.

1700
01:03:41,768 --> 01:03:42,768
What are they?

1701
01:03:43,008 --> 01:03:45,138
"Find a nomad who raises more than 100 sheep and milk one of them."

1702
01:03:45,138 --> 01:03:46,738
This doesn't make sense. "Eyesight..."

1703
01:03:46,738 --> 01:03:48,908
We'll never be able to find a nomad with such good eyesight.

1704
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:51,238
How will we find the descendants of Genghis Khan?

1705
01:03:51,668 --> 01:03:53,208
Is that even possible?

1706
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:55,008
(They're worried about today's mission.)

1707
01:03:55,738 --> 01:03:57,408
- Goodness. - Look at the blue sky by the way.

1708
01:03:57,408 --> 01:03:59,568
Ji Hyo. Look over there.

1709
01:03:59,568 --> 01:04:00,608
Look at the sky.

1710
01:04:00,768 --> 01:04:02,768
This is just amazing.

1711
01:04:02,768 --> 01:04:03,938
I didn't know Mongolia was...

1712
01:04:03,938 --> 01:04:05,738
- this beautiful. - Look at the mountains.

1713
01:04:05,738 --> 01:04:09,138
How did you feel as soon as you arrived in Mongolia?

1714
01:04:09,138 --> 01:04:10,508
I happen to run.

1715
01:04:10,508 --> 01:04:12,908
(I just have to run like this.)

1716
01:04:13,238 --> 01:04:15,238
- Gosh. - She's strange.

1717
01:04:15,238 --> 01:04:17,908
- I told you. - Don't you agree?

1718
01:04:17,908 --> 01:04:21,108
It's that you want to run and enjoy the field.

1719
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:22,838
Weren't you surprised in the plane?

1720
01:04:22,838 --> 01:04:24,368
I was.

1721
01:04:24,368 --> 01:04:26,038
- It's flatland. - There were no cities.

1722
01:04:26,038 --> 01:04:28,938
(They were impressed by the vast flatland.)

1723
01:04:28,938 --> 01:04:31,768
She said we were crossing a desert, and it continued for 10 minutes.

1724
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:35,408
- Right. - The trees were scraggly...

1725
01:04:35,408 --> 01:04:37,438
like Seok Jin's hair.

1726
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:40,608
(She only tried to explain the greatness of it.)

1727
01:04:40,608 --> 01:04:43,308
Come over here. You really...

1728
01:04:43,408 --> 01:04:44,708
- What did you say? - So Min.

1729
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:46,608
(So Min still attacks Seok Jin even in Mongolia.)

1730
01:04:46,608 --> 01:04:47,608
(So Min still attacks Seok Jin even in Mongolia.)

1731
01:04:48,708 --> 01:04:51,038
- My gosh. - That was a wrong comparison.

1732
01:04:51,038 --> 01:04:52,238
Do you have any idea?

1733
01:04:52,238 --> 01:04:54,308
(Meanwhile, in Russia)

1734
01:04:54,308 --> 01:04:56,008
Catching 10 kinds of fish will be more difficult.

1735
01:04:56,008 --> 01:04:58,868
If you use a net,

1736
01:04:58,868 --> 01:05:00,768
you'll catch many kinds of fish.

1737
01:05:00,768 --> 01:05:03,208
Just catching 1m king crab would be better.

1738
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:04,708
- Does it even exist? - No way.

1739
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:06,308
You can never catch it.

1740
01:05:06,308 --> 01:05:07,308
This is the easiest.

1741
01:05:07,308 --> 01:05:08,938
- You think everything's so easy. - Catching a pollack.

1742
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:10,738
- I mean... - Now, I know...

1743
01:05:10,738 --> 01:05:13,238
that you're the type he hates the most.

1744
01:05:13,238 --> 01:05:15,208
- Gosh. - I know you're trying...

1745
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:16,838
- to alienate us. - It's not true.

1746
01:05:16,838 --> 01:05:18,508
Sorry, I was too thoughtless.

1747
01:05:18,508 --> 01:05:20,708
How it turns out doesn't really matter to me, you see.

1748
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:22,108
That's my point.

1749
01:05:22,108 --> 01:05:23,468
But you're leading us for our sake now.

1750
01:05:23,468 --> 01:05:25,338
- Thanks so much. - He's so considerate.

1751
01:05:25,468 --> 01:05:27,108
I'll throw my shoe then.

1752
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:29,908
- Okay. - Just avoid throwing here.

1753
01:05:29,908 --> 01:05:31,408
- Not this. - Not the 1m king crab one.

1754
01:05:31,868 --> 01:05:32,868
- You know me. - Okay.

1755
01:05:32,868 --> 01:05:35,208
- You know I'm good at this. - Pick the first one.

1756
01:05:35,208 --> 01:05:36,808
What's in season?

1757
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:38,308
Pollacks are in season.

1758
01:05:38,308 --> 01:05:39,568
Is that right?

1759
01:05:39,608 --> 01:05:41,608
Then let's aim for the pollack mission.

1760
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:45,138
All right. I knew it'd be in season.

1761
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:46,408
Challenge.

1762
01:05:46,408 --> 01:05:47,838
(Jong Kook is ready.)

1763
01:05:47,968 --> 01:05:53,138
(With his lackeys' desperate wishes,)

1764
01:05:53,138 --> 01:05:56,938
(he throws his shoe to the mission board!)

1765
01:05:58,108 --> 01:06:01,108
(Their only hope is to catch pollack in season.)

1766
01:06:01,108 --> 01:06:03,708
(The other missions look impossible.)

1767
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:04,808
Please!

1768
01:06:04,808 --> 01:06:06,368
(The other missions look impossible.)

1769
01:06:06,368 --> 01:06:08,968
(It lands on "Catching a king crab and 10 kinds of fish".)

1770
01:06:10,868 --> 01:06:12,608
- Wait. - Let's do this again.

1771
01:06:12,608 --> 01:06:13,968
It'll not be fun at all.

1772
01:06:14,568 --> 01:06:17,308
"Catching a king crab and 10 kinds of fish".

1773
01:06:17,308 --> 01:06:18,308
Well...

1774
01:06:18,668 --> 01:06:20,138
He didn't shout, "Challenge!"

1775
01:06:20,138 --> 01:06:21,308
He did, but we didn't.

1776
01:06:21,308 --> 01:06:22,408
That doesn't count.

1777
01:06:22,408 --> 01:06:23,738
- We had to do it all together. - One of us should throw.

1778
01:06:23,738 --> 01:06:25,738
We should say "Challenge" all together.

1779
01:06:25,738 --> 01:06:27,568
I should be the one shouting it.

1780
01:06:27,568 --> 01:06:29,038
No, we should do it together.

1781
01:06:29,038 --> 01:06:30,108
He's right.

1782
01:06:30,108 --> 01:06:31,708
Just do it. Catch 10 kinds of fish.

1783
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:33,768
I'm not doing it, so you do it.

1784
01:06:33,768 --> 01:06:36,408
He would've scolded so much if someone else picked this.

1785
01:06:36,808 --> 01:06:39,438
He would've scolded so much if someone else picked this.

1786
01:06:39,808 --> 01:06:41,808
- My gosh. - I didn't say a word.

1787
01:06:41,808 --> 01:06:43,838
- What did you say? - Kwang Soo crossed the line.

1788
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:45,708
- I didn't say anything. - I was joking.

1789
01:06:45,708 --> 01:06:47,208
- I was just saying. - He's hurt now.

1790
01:06:47,208 --> 01:06:48,708
- I'm hurt. - You're out.

1791
01:06:48,708 --> 01:06:51,068
- Are you okay? - It was a joke.

1792
01:06:51,068 --> 01:06:54,168
- We'll be able to make up for it. - Yes, I'll work hard.

1793
01:06:54,168 --> 01:06:56,238
- You know what Kwang Soo said? - What?

1794
01:06:56,468 --> 01:06:58,938
If he's going to win anyway,

1795
01:06:59,338 --> 01:07:02,568
he'd rather lose all the missions so that the three of us can go.

1796
01:07:02,568 --> 01:07:03,838
Thank you.

1797
01:07:04,238 --> 01:07:05,368
He means "Thank you."

1798
01:07:05,508 --> 01:07:06,668
Thank you.

1799
01:07:06,668 --> 01:07:08,268
- He means "Thank you." - He means "Thank you."

1800
01:07:08,268 --> 01:07:09,338
- He means "Thank you." - He means "Thank you."

1801
01:07:09,438 --> 01:07:11,768
- Thank you. - He means "Thank you."

1802
01:07:12,938 --> 01:07:14,208
Thank you.

1803
01:07:14,438 --> 01:07:16,508
- Thank you. - Thank you, Haha.

1804
01:07:16,508 --> 01:07:17,708
Thank you.

1805
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:19,738
(They never got to say how thankful they were to each other.)

1806
01:07:19,938 --> 01:07:22,168
So which one's the best?

1807
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:23,368
"Find a nomad..."

1808
01:07:23,368 --> 01:07:26,108
Isn't it faster to find a nomad who has over 100 sheep?

1809
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:28,738
- I don't know which one's better. - Seok Jin.

1810
01:07:29,108 --> 01:07:30,908
Let's just give it a try.

1811
01:07:31,238 --> 01:07:32,538
- Challenge. - So Min.

1812
01:07:32,538 --> 01:07:34,238
(So Min gives it a try.)

1813
01:07:34,238 --> 01:07:38,038
(She didn't have any luck in Japan.)

1814
01:07:38,038 --> 01:07:39,738
(So Min is not good in the shoe throw.)

1815
01:07:39,908 --> 01:07:41,068
- Challenge. - So Min.

1816
01:07:41,068 --> 01:07:42,768
Aim for the right corner because...

1817
01:07:42,768 --> 01:07:44,438
Descendants of Genghis Khan is better.

1818
01:07:44,438 --> 01:07:46,168
- When I did it last time... - Just go for it.

1819
01:07:46,168 --> 01:07:47,338
You won't get a penalty anyways.

1820
01:07:47,338 --> 01:07:51,538
(She doesn't hesitate and kicks her shoe.)

1821
01:07:51,538 --> 01:07:52,738
She did it.

1822
01:07:52,738 --> 01:07:53,938
(What did we expect?)

1823
01:07:53,938 --> 01:07:55,738
- Here we go again. - How far are you kicking it?

1824
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:56,908
You won't get a penalty anyways.

1825
01:07:57,308 --> 01:07:58,968
(So Min never fails to impress.)

1826
01:07:58,968 --> 01:08:00,838
- Here we go. - Look at her.

1827
01:08:01,078 --> 01:08:02,838
This much is good.

1828
01:08:02,908 --> 01:08:05,038
Aim for the center.

1829
01:08:05,768 --> 01:08:07,138
- Challenge. - Challenge.

1830
01:08:07,578 --> 01:08:09,538
(Dropping)

1831
01:08:09,538 --> 01:08:10,538
Oh, gosh.

1832
01:08:10,668 --> 01:08:12,368
You're such high maintenance.

1833
01:08:12,578 --> 01:08:13,578
Challenge.

1834
01:08:14,008 --> 01:08:19,838
(That's enough fun for now. She'll do it right this time.)

1835
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:24,608
(What will the mission be in Mongolia?)

1836
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:27,578
(Descendants of Genghis Khan, milk a sheep with the nomads)

1837
01:08:27,578 --> 01:08:29,038
I don't know if we should be happy about this.

1838
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:32,578
(Descendants of Genghis Khan, milk a sheep with the nomads)

1839
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:35,468
She said she wanted to do this.

1840
01:08:35,468 --> 01:08:39,138
So you must find Borjigit Tribe...

1841
01:08:39,208 --> 01:08:42,368
- where Genghis Khan belonged to. - Borjigit Tribe?

1842
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:44,208
I guess that's the name of the tribe.

1843
01:08:44,668 --> 01:08:48,268
They're 20 percent of the Mongolian population.

1844
01:08:48,268 --> 01:08:49,408
What's that like for us?

1845
01:08:49,408 --> 01:08:51,768
- They're 20 percent of population? - That's Kim or Park.

1846
01:08:51,768 --> 01:08:54,308
20 percent is not that much.

1847
01:08:54,308 --> 01:08:55,868
- It's not? - It's kind of like Jeon.

1848
01:08:55,868 --> 01:08:57,238
I think there may be more of Song.

1849
01:08:57,238 --> 01:08:58,368
My last name is Chun.

1850
01:08:59,838 --> 01:09:01,968
(Right, your last name is Chun.)

1851
01:09:01,968 --> 01:09:04,108
Are you a secret agent?

1852
01:09:04,768 --> 01:09:05,908
- My last name is Chun. - Hey,

1853
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:07,508
your passport says you're Soo Yeon,

1854
01:09:07,868 --> 01:09:10,868
and you say your last name is Chun when I thought you were Song Ji Hyo.

1855
01:09:10,868 --> 01:09:12,508
- My last name is Chun. - What's wrong with you?

1856
01:09:12,668 --> 01:09:14,338
Chun is my last name.

1857
01:09:14,338 --> 01:09:16,838
Look at you. I don't know what the truth is with you.

1858
01:09:16,838 --> 01:09:19,868
Hey, this is good. Descendants of Genghis Khan.

1859
01:09:19,868 --> 01:09:22,338
- Right. - We'll have to milk a sheep anyhow.

1860
01:09:22,338 --> 01:09:23,578
Have you milked a sheep before?

1861
01:09:24,138 --> 01:09:25,938
- Don't you just pull on them? - But...

1862
01:09:25,938 --> 01:09:27,468
Is this how you do it?

1863
01:09:27,468 --> 01:09:30,438
- I haven't done it before. - Only the females milk, right?

1864
01:09:30,438 --> 01:09:34,738
(Only the females milk, right?)

1865
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:36,668
- What did you say? - Why would rams milk?

1866
01:09:36,668 --> 01:09:38,968
- Only ewes milk, right? - Of course.

1867
01:09:38,968 --> 01:09:40,738
I had to think about that for a second.

1868
01:09:41,008 --> 01:09:42,578
Don't all sheep have udders?

1869
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:43,738
- Don't they? - No.

1870
01:09:43,738 --> 01:09:47,338
All cattles have udders. Even bulls have them.

1871
01:09:47,338 --> 01:09:49,608
- Only cows milk though. - Jae Seok.

1872
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:51,078
- Jae Seok. - Yes?

1873
01:09:51,138 --> 01:09:52,268
And...

1874
01:09:52,908 --> 01:09:55,308
- I was thinking about cattles. - Stop being ignorant.

1875
01:09:55,308 --> 01:09:56,508
They all have udders.

1876
01:09:56,608 --> 01:09:59,408
- That's why they're cattles. - When you go to a farm,

1877
01:09:59,408 --> 01:10:02,168
they only bring out cows that milk.

1878
01:10:02,168 --> 01:10:03,368
- Don't all females and males... - That's not why.

1879
01:10:03,368 --> 01:10:05,908
- have udders? - Bulls don't milk.

1880
01:10:05,908 --> 01:10:07,208
They don't milk.

1881
01:10:07,208 --> 01:10:09,368
They don't, right? They might still have udders.

1882
01:10:09,368 --> 01:10:11,838
Hey, why would you mention this? Stop it.

1883
01:10:11,838 --> 01:10:15,108
(Stop talking nonsense.)

1884
01:10:15,108 --> 01:10:16,438
Excuse me,

1885
01:10:16,438 --> 01:10:18,108
- Ms. Chun Soo Yeon. - Do it.

1886
01:10:18,368 --> 01:10:19,908
She has three personalities in her.

1887
01:10:20,108 --> 01:10:23,538
There are Chun Sung Im, Song Ji Hyo, and Chun Soo Yeon.

1888
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:25,338
- Stop it. - She has three identities.

1889
01:10:25,338 --> 01:10:26,838
- Ms. Chun Soo Yeon. - My goodness.

1890
01:10:26,838 --> 01:10:29,038
- She's not being herself. - Why did you mention it?

1891
01:10:29,238 --> 01:10:30,578
- Don't say anything. - You know what?

1892
01:10:30,578 --> 01:10:33,908
So Min is not intimidated by us...

1893
01:10:33,908 --> 01:10:35,138
but she's intimidated by Ji Hyo.

1894
01:10:35,638 --> 01:10:36,968
She's intimidated by Ji Hyo but not me.

1895
01:10:36,968 --> 01:10:38,808
- She's intimidated by Ji Hyo. - I mean...

1896
01:10:38,808 --> 01:10:41,508
- All cattles, females or males, - They all have it.

1897
01:10:41,508 --> 01:10:43,268
- all have udders, - They do.

1898
01:10:43,268 --> 01:10:45,138
but bulls don't milk, right?

1899
01:10:45,138 --> 01:10:47,168
- Of course now. Do you milk? - But still...

1900
01:10:47,638 --> 01:10:49,368
(That's a very clever answer.)

1901
01:10:49,368 --> 01:10:50,768
- This is driving me nuts. - You don't milk, right?

1902
01:10:51,138 --> 01:10:53,268
They have udders to balance themselves.

1903
01:10:53,438 --> 01:10:54,608
Stop it.

1904
01:10:55,108 --> 01:10:56,308
We just got here and...

1905
01:10:56,308 --> 01:11:00,078
My father has disproportionate nipples so what does that mean?

1906
01:11:00,078 --> 01:11:01,268
Stop it.

1907
01:11:01,538 --> 01:11:03,108
What are you saying?

1908
01:11:03,408 --> 01:11:06,208
- Of course, he has nipples. - So it might be the other way.

1909
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:07,638
- They still don't milk? - They have udders.

1910
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:09,838
(This argument has to be over.)

1911
01:11:09,838 --> 01:11:11,968
- They don't milk, right? - Of course.

1912
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:13,368
- You squeeze their udders, - We finished this discussion.

1913
01:11:13,368 --> 01:11:17,168
- Hey! Stop it! - Why are you still talking?

1914
01:11:17,768 --> 01:11:19,938
- That's Ms. Chun Soo Yeon. - It's Chun Soo Yeon.

1915
01:11:19,938 --> 01:11:22,208
- They all have udders! - Ms. Chun Soo Yeon.

1916
01:11:22,608 --> 01:11:23,668
(She's relieved now.)

1917
01:11:23,668 --> 01:11:25,938
- Don't. - They all have udders.

1918
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:27,908
- We are... - They all have udders!

1919
01:11:28,008 --> 01:11:29,768
We are talking about...

1920
01:11:29,768 --> 01:11:31,908
- udders too much in Mongolia. - Don't be angry.

1921
01:11:31,908 --> 01:11:35,408
- They all have udders, Jae Seok. - We talked a lot about it. Sorry.

1922
01:11:37,468 --> 01:11:38,868
- Your mission... - Yes.

1923
01:11:39,368 --> 01:11:42,708
is to catch king crab and 10 kinds of fish.

1924
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:45,868
Team Ji Hyo's mission is to find a nomad who are descendants...

1925
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:48,638
- of Genghis Khan and milk a sheep. - It's Chun Sung Im.

1926
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:50,078
Each member has to collect 1L...

1927
01:11:50,078 --> 01:11:51,938
- to a total of 4L. - That's too much.

1928
01:11:51,938 --> 01:11:53,608
- 4L? - That's the mission.

1929
01:11:53,608 --> 01:11:55,268
Before you start your mission...

1930
01:11:55,268 --> 01:11:58,038
Before you start your mission, you will be provided money for the trip.

1931
01:11:58,708 --> 01:12:00,968
You will be provided money for the trip.

1932
01:12:00,968 --> 01:12:02,038
- That's good. - Good.

1933
01:12:02,308 --> 01:12:03,908
- Really? - It's a debit card.

1934
01:12:03,908 --> 01:12:05,338
(It's a debit card?)

1935
01:12:05,338 --> 01:12:07,538
You can go to the ATM...

1936
01:12:08,738 --> 01:12:10,308
- Do we cash it out? - It's 800 dollars...

1937
01:12:10,738 --> 01:12:13,608
- or around 40,000 Russian rubles. - 40,000 rubles?

1938
01:12:13,608 --> 01:12:15,838
For a trip of 1 night and 2 days, you get 120 dollars each.

1939
01:12:15,838 --> 01:12:19,838
That adds up to 480 dollars and we added 20 dollars to a total of 500.

1940
01:12:19,908 --> 01:12:22,708
Please cash it out and start your mission right away.

1941
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:24,038
- Do we cash it out now? - Yes.

1942
01:12:24,468 --> 01:12:26,738
Where are we going to stay?

1943
01:12:26,738 --> 01:12:27,838
You must find your own lodging.

1944
01:12:27,838 --> 01:12:29,008
- We do? - Yes.

1945
01:12:29,108 --> 01:12:31,768
- We'll only provide transportation. - With 480 dollars?

1946
01:12:31,768 --> 01:12:35,168
You must find your own boat, captain, and lodging.

1947
01:12:35,168 --> 01:12:37,938
- We must find them ourselves? - You must recruit them.

1948
01:12:38,638 --> 01:12:40,208
So what do you guys do?

1949
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:41,768
(What do the staff do?)

1950
01:12:41,768 --> 01:12:42,768
(We'll make great shots of you.)

1951
01:12:42,768 --> 01:12:43,908
What do you do?

1952
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:45,538
- They film us. - Is that what they do?

1953
01:12:45,808 --> 01:12:47,768
- Let's go downtown. - Let's do that.

1954
01:12:47,768 --> 01:12:48,968
- Let's go there first. - Okay.

1955
01:12:48,968 --> 01:12:50,168
Let's face it first.

1956
01:12:50,168 --> 01:12:52,838
All right, so our team...

1957
01:12:52,838 --> 01:12:54,938
Captain Song's team...

1958
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:57,468
- Chun Soo Yeon's team... - Chun Soo Yeon's team.

1959
01:12:57,468 --> 01:12:59,038
- will be heading to Ulaanbaatar. - Yes!

1960
01:12:59,038 --> 01:13:02,338
- In Mongolia, - Yes!

1961
01:13:02,338 --> 01:13:06,508
Excuse me. Don't say that when I haven't even finished speaking.

1962
01:13:06,508 --> 01:13:08,208
- Why do you sound so robotic? - Don't you know something?

1963
01:13:08,608 --> 01:13:11,138
We'll head to Ulaanbaatar...

1964
01:13:11,138 --> 01:13:12,908
Jae Seok, you've already said that. Let's go.

1965
01:13:12,908 --> 01:13:14,668
Because the sheep...

1966
01:13:14,668 --> 01:13:15,838
One for Jae Seok.

1967
01:13:16,368 --> 01:13:18,138
Give him like three.

1968
01:13:18,338 --> 01:13:19,938
- Come on. - Give him three.

1969
01:13:20,438 --> 01:13:21,708
- Yu... - This is tight.

1970
01:13:21,708 --> 01:13:23,138
But she likes me.

1971
01:13:23,638 --> 01:13:26,368
- She likes me better. - She really likes me.

1972
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:28,578
- Ulaanbaatar! - I like So Min the best.

1973
01:13:28,708 --> 01:13:29,808
Let's go.

1974
01:13:29,868 --> 01:13:31,838
This is nice. Mongolia is nice.

1975
01:13:31,838 --> 01:13:32,838
(What adventure awaits this team?)

1976
01:13:34,308 --> 01:13:35,508
(They don't know where to go.)

1977
01:13:35,508 --> 01:13:36,708
Yes.

1978
01:13:37,168 --> 01:13:38,868
How are the prices here?

1979
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:40,338
Five cents...

1980
01:13:40,338 --> 01:13:43,968
is around one tughrik or something.

1981
01:13:43,968 --> 01:13:45,708
You must have looked into it.

1982
01:13:46,578 --> 01:13:49,578
(During the flight)

1983
01:13:50,638 --> 01:13:57,768
(She wakes up and starts studying about Mongolia.)

1984
01:14:01,138 --> 01:14:03,638
(So Min is the expert on Mongolia.)

1985
01:14:03,638 --> 01:14:08,838
(She knows about their bills and the local food.)

1986
01:14:10,638 --> 01:14:14,868
(She knows their language...)

1987
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:18,078
(and even knows the Mongolian traditional games.)

1988
01:14:18,508 --> 01:14:19,668
Hey.

1989
01:14:21,868 --> 01:14:23,938
(Trust me when it comes to Mongolia.)

1990
01:14:25,078 --> 01:14:27,468
(They drive across an unfamiliar scenery.)

1991
01:14:27,468 --> 01:14:30,138
Mongolia feels so foreign.

1992
01:14:30,138 --> 01:14:31,908
It's what you expected Mongolia to be.

1993
01:14:31,908 --> 01:14:33,938
I haven't been to a country with such clear sky.

1994
01:14:33,938 --> 01:14:35,808
(An endless plain extends under the clear sky.)

1995
01:14:35,808 --> 01:14:37,368
It's so vast.

1996
01:14:37,368 --> 01:14:38,938
It looks like a sheep farm.

1997
01:14:38,938 --> 01:14:41,168
I guess this is what we saw when we got off the plane.

1998
01:14:41,168 --> 01:14:42,808
I was wondering what that was.

1999
01:14:42,808 --> 01:14:44,008
Isn't this fascinating?

2000
01:14:44,838 --> 01:14:46,808
Mountains are like lawns.

2001
01:14:46,808 --> 01:14:48,108
There are no trees in the mountains.

2002
01:14:48,108 --> 01:14:50,738
There are mountains everywhere.

2003
01:14:51,508 --> 01:14:54,638
This is where Genghis Khan would have ridden his horses.

2004
01:14:54,638 --> 01:14:56,208
We don't know if it was here.

2005
01:14:56,208 --> 01:14:57,668
- It would have been here. - We don't know that.

2006
01:14:57,668 --> 01:14:58,868
I'm talking about Mongolia.

2007
01:14:58,868 --> 01:15:00,868
- It's a ger. - I'm talking about Mongolia.

2008
01:15:01,368 --> 01:15:02,938
- Look. - You're right.

2009
01:15:02,938 --> 01:15:04,368
- It's a ger, right? - It is.

2010
01:15:04,578 --> 01:15:05,838
(Ger is a portable tent that the Mongolian tribes use.)

2011
01:15:05,838 --> 01:15:09,368
It feels like the past and the present exist together.

2012
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:13,438
Let's go downtown and exchange money first.

2013
01:15:13,438 --> 01:15:14,438
We should eat.

2014
01:15:14,438 --> 01:15:15,808
- We have to eat. - Let's eat.

2015
01:15:15,808 --> 01:15:17,908
- Let's have something good. - Let's eat something good.

2016
01:15:17,908 --> 01:15:19,668
- Let's go to a convenience store. - Sounds good.

2017
01:15:19,668 --> 01:15:22,138
- We need to get toothpaste. - When you come to a new country...

2018
01:15:22,138 --> 01:15:25,008
- You didn't bring toothpaste? - I didn't.

2019
01:15:25,308 --> 01:15:27,168
- You didn't bring it either, right? - Of course not.

2020
01:15:27,168 --> 01:15:28,838
I knew he wouldn't bring it.

2021
01:15:28,838 --> 01:15:30,308
I didn't like him for it so I didn't bring it either.

2022
01:15:30,308 --> 01:15:31,538
Hey, you...

2023
01:15:31,538 --> 01:15:33,238
That must be downtown.

2024
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:36,108
(They're finally here.)

2025
01:15:36,468 --> 01:15:38,108
- I'm getting excited. - It's interesting.

2026
01:15:38,438 --> 01:15:40,578
It's a city between the mountains.

2027
01:15:41,768 --> 01:15:43,338
I bet lamb is good.

2028
01:15:43,768 --> 01:15:45,108
This looks like downtown.

2029
01:15:45,108 --> 01:15:46,468
- Look. It's big. - It looks good.

2030
01:15:47,338 --> 01:15:48,768
This looks like downtown.

2031
01:15:48,768 --> 01:15:50,108
(It's Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.)

2032
01:15:50,108 --> 01:15:54,638
(Meaning "Red Hero", it's a city of politics, economy, and culture.)

2033
01:15:54,638 --> 01:15:56,638
- Shall we get off? - Let's get off.

2034
01:15:57,738 --> 01:15:58,838
This is Mongolia.

2035
01:15:58,838 --> 01:16:01,738
(Nice to meet you.)

2036
01:16:01,738 --> 01:16:05,738
- This must be a city hall. - Exactly.

2037
01:16:05,738 --> 01:16:08,608
(Sukhbaatar Square is in the center of Ulaanbaatar.)

2038
01:16:08,608 --> 01:16:10,308
It's quiet.

2039
01:16:10,908 --> 01:16:13,268
It looks like Sejong Center Chamber Hall.

2040
01:16:13,638 --> 01:16:16,578
It looks like Sejong Center Chamber Hall here.

2041
01:16:16,578 --> 01:16:18,808
It looks like Sejong Center Chamber Hall, right?

2042
01:16:19,038 --> 01:16:22,308
- He's Genghis Khan. - I see.

2043
01:16:22,468 --> 01:16:23,608
Here he is.

2044
01:16:23,608 --> 01:16:25,538
That's his son.

2045
01:16:25,838 --> 01:16:27,508
- That's his son? - I was going to say that.

2046
01:16:27,508 --> 01:16:30,838
- They usually sit in the middle. - There's one there too.

2047
01:16:30,838 --> 01:16:32,738
- This is his son. - So that's Genghis Khan.

2048
01:16:32,738 --> 01:16:34,668
That's why it's smaller.

2049
01:16:34,768 --> 01:16:37,578
- That one's bigger. - Yes, it's bigger.

2050
01:16:37,838 --> 01:16:40,708
- He's just talking random things. - I don't get anything.

2051
01:16:40,768 --> 01:16:43,578
Just talk about whatever you feel.

2052
01:16:43,768 --> 01:16:45,738
There's another statue there too.

2053
01:16:46,008 --> 01:16:48,238
- That must be his older son. - It's a bit bigger.

2054
01:16:48,238 --> 01:16:50,338
- The other one was his younger son. - It's large, medium, and small.

2055
01:16:50,338 --> 01:16:51,508
That's right.

2056
01:16:51,508 --> 01:16:52,938
This is Genghis Khan.

2057
01:16:53,468 --> 01:16:55,008
He's magnificent.

2058
01:16:55,008 --> 01:16:57,438
- He has a fine appearance. - He does.

2059
01:16:58,238 --> 01:16:59,738
- He's majestic. - He looks dignified.

2060
01:16:59,738 --> 01:17:01,838
(He was a military strategist and founder of Mongol Empire.)

2061
01:17:01,838 --> 01:17:03,038
He looks awesome.

2062
01:17:03,038 --> 01:17:04,108
Look.

2063
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:05,368
It's the same as in Korea.

2064
01:17:05,368 --> 01:17:06,968
- Look at the cop. - I thought he was Korean.

2065
01:17:06,968 --> 01:17:08,168
- He's a Korean cop. - They look the same.

2066
01:17:08,168 --> 01:17:10,108
That looks like a Korean bus.

2067
01:17:10,108 --> 01:17:11,468
(The police uniform looks similar to ones in Korea.)

2068
01:17:11,868 --> 01:17:13,268
I don't know what it says.

2069
01:17:13,268 --> 01:17:15,108
- It says... - I can't read it.

2070
01:17:15,468 --> 01:17:16,538
Mo...

2071
01:17:16,538 --> 01:17:18,578
- Mo... - Isn't it a motel?

2072
01:17:18,578 --> 01:17:20,078
Isn't it something like that?

2073
01:17:20,138 --> 01:17:21,538
It looks like a motel, right?

2074
01:17:22,268 --> 01:17:23,408
- It's like... - Hey.

2075
01:17:23,408 --> 01:17:25,368
Look to the left.

2076
01:17:25,638 --> 01:17:27,868
Don't motels have that sauna symbol?

2077
01:17:27,868 --> 01:17:29,938
- That's not right. - It's not?

2078
01:17:29,938 --> 01:17:31,608
It doesn't look like a sauna symbol.

2079
01:17:31,608 --> 01:17:33,608
- It is. It's a sauna symbol. - Is it a motel?

2080
01:17:34,578 --> 01:17:39,208
(Mohroa Ophoo Mahavyalar?)

2081
01:17:39,208 --> 01:17:41,138
- It's the building for trade union. - Is that right?

2082
01:17:41,138 --> 01:17:42,468
It's for a trade union?

2083
01:17:42,468 --> 01:17:44,268
It started with "Mo" so we thought it was a motel.

2084
01:17:44,268 --> 01:17:45,738
It's a trade union building.

2085
01:17:45,738 --> 01:17:47,578
We're sorry. Excuse us.

2086
01:17:47,578 --> 01:17:48,668
The important thing here...

2087
01:17:48,668 --> 01:17:50,638
is that you guys don't know much about traveling.

2088
01:17:50,638 --> 01:17:53,038
- What do you mean? - Everybody,

2089
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:55,578
so you're here. What time is it by the way?

2090
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:58,078
- It's 7:15pm right now. - What's the time?

2091
01:17:58,468 --> 01:18:01,108
And it feels like broad daylight?

2092
01:18:01,108 --> 01:18:02,938
It's 7pm, and it's so bright.

2093
01:18:02,938 --> 01:18:04,638
- Aren't you guys hungry? - I am.

2094
01:18:04,708 --> 01:18:07,538
- Let's eat first, Captain Song. - Let's eat.

2095
01:18:07,538 --> 01:18:08,578
So Min,

2096
01:18:08,638 --> 01:18:10,508
let's withdraw cash first.

2097
01:18:10,508 --> 01:18:13,038
- Let's withdraw money. - Let's look for the ATM.

2098
01:18:13,038 --> 01:18:14,608
Let's check out...

2099
01:18:14,608 --> 01:18:16,868
- where we got off. There's an ATM. - I don't know if we can do it.

2100
01:18:17,738 --> 01:18:19,238
Babies are so cute.

2101
01:18:19,238 --> 01:18:20,968
They look like Korean babies.

2102
01:18:20,968 --> 01:18:22,738
- They look like Korean kids. - They do.

2103
01:18:22,738 --> 01:18:23,738
It feels like I'm in Korea.

2104
01:18:23,738 --> 01:18:26,078
- It fees like a relaxing afternoon. - It's the weekend.

2105
01:18:26,078 --> 01:18:27,578
It is the weekend.

2106
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:29,238
- Isn't it so nice here? - Yes.

2107
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:31,468
The air is so fresh.

2108
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:34,508
Where's the ATM?

2109
01:18:36,308 --> 01:18:37,968
There it is. It's an ATM.

2110
01:18:38,208 --> 01:18:39,238
There it is.

2111
01:18:39,238 --> 01:18:40,578
- It says ATM. - Let's wait outside.

2112
01:18:42,738 --> 01:18:44,368
It says Busan Terminal.

2113
01:18:44,368 --> 01:18:46,608
- It's Busan Terminal. - Right.

2114
01:18:46,608 --> 01:18:50,308
It's Busan Terminal. It leaves from Gyeongju and Pohang.

2115
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:52,138
- My gosh. - Let's go to Busan.

2116
01:18:52,368 --> 01:18:54,638
It leaves from Gyeongju and Pohang.

2117
01:18:54,808 --> 01:18:56,638
- Hi. - I'm so glad to see it.

2118
01:18:56,638 --> 01:18:58,078
I'm really glad to see it too.

2119
01:18:58,078 --> 01:19:00,638
- These are used cars. - A lot of used cars...

2120
01:19:00,638 --> 01:19:02,668
get exported to Mongolia.

2121
01:19:04,168 --> 01:19:06,208
- Here it is. Captain Song. - Yes?

2122
01:19:07,268 --> 01:19:08,808
Do we know how to use this?

2123
01:19:08,808 --> 01:19:10,608
It's all in Mongolian. What do we do?

2124
01:19:10,908 --> 01:19:12,168
Should we insert the card first?

2125
01:19:12,168 --> 01:19:13,908
How much is 20,000?

2126
01:19:13,908 --> 01:19:14,938
- English. - English.

2127
01:19:14,938 --> 01:19:16,308
- That's 1,000 dollars. - Divided by...

2128
01:19:16,438 --> 01:19:17,608
- Two... - Password.

2129
01:19:19,468 --> 01:19:20,808
It's six digits.

2130
01:19:20,808 --> 01:19:23,368
(They can't get past the password.)

2131
01:19:23,468 --> 01:19:25,578
- It's six digits. - Please...

2132
01:19:26,368 --> 01:19:27,668
"Please enter your..."

2133
01:19:27,668 --> 01:19:30,738
(They stare at the screen without doing anything.)

2134
01:19:30,738 --> 01:19:31,868
This...

2135
01:19:32,168 --> 01:19:34,368
- What's the ID? - We can't do it?

2136
01:19:34,638 --> 01:19:36,038
I knew we wouldn't be able to do it.

2137
01:19:37,008 --> 01:19:39,008
We can't eat because we don't have money.

2138
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:41,308
We just got started.

2139
01:19:41,308 --> 01:19:42,768
- I knew it. - Look at him.

2140
01:19:42,808 --> 01:19:44,908
I couldn't withdraw money one time so I couldn't buy food.

2141
01:19:44,908 --> 01:19:46,838
- It's six digits. - We won't be able to do it.

2142
01:19:46,938 --> 01:19:48,268
What just happened?

2143
01:19:48,268 --> 01:19:49,578
- Jae Seok. - It took our card.

2144
01:19:50,168 --> 01:19:51,338
The card...

2145
01:19:51,768 --> 01:19:53,268
It took our card.

2146
01:19:53,268 --> 01:19:54,508
What happened?

2147
01:19:54,508 --> 01:19:55,768
Let me see.

2148
01:19:55,768 --> 01:19:57,268
I think it's an error.

2149
01:19:58,508 --> 01:20:00,578
- It took our card. - Wait.

2150
01:20:00,578 --> 01:20:01,908
It came out.

2151
01:20:01,908 --> 01:20:02,968
My gosh.

2152
01:20:02,968 --> 01:20:05,578
(That was close.)

2153
01:20:05,578 --> 01:20:07,338
- Give it to me. - Let go.

2154
01:20:07,338 --> 01:20:08,578
- That startled me. - Me too.

2155
01:20:08,578 --> 01:20:09,768
I was startled. I thought it took our card.

2156
01:20:09,768 --> 01:20:12,508
We almost had to sleep at the square.

2157
01:20:12,508 --> 01:20:14,638
He keeps instilling fear in me.

2158
01:20:14,638 --> 01:20:16,508
We can't withdraw money here.

2159
01:20:16,508 --> 01:20:19,268
- We can't do it. - Can't it take another bank's card?

2160
01:20:19,268 --> 01:20:21,338
- Wait. Give it to me. - What do you mean?

2161
01:20:21,338 --> 01:20:22,938
See if it says Visa on it.

2162
01:20:23,038 --> 01:20:24,078
It doesn't.

2163
01:20:24,078 --> 01:20:25,538
We have this though.

2164
01:20:25,708 --> 01:20:26,808
It's not Union Pay.

2165
01:20:26,808 --> 01:20:28,908
It's at the back.

2166
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:31,008
- It should work. - Visa should work then.

2167
01:20:31,008 --> 01:20:32,078
(If they can't withdraw money, they'll be abandoned here.)

2168
01:20:32,908 --> 01:20:35,968
(They focus and try again.)

2169
01:20:37,968 --> 01:20:39,538
- We can't get past the password. - Password...

2170
01:20:39,738 --> 01:20:42,268
(He enters a password.)

2171
01:20:42,268 --> 01:20:43,368
Enter.

2172
01:20:44,008 --> 01:20:45,768
- It worked. - It worked.

2173
01:20:45,968 --> 01:20:48,078
Isn't it "withdraw"?

2174
01:20:48,078 --> 01:20:49,938
- Balance... - Go there.

2175
01:20:50,308 --> 01:20:51,808
Wait. "Please select your..."

2176
01:20:51,808 --> 01:20:53,308
(It's reading comprehension time.)

2177
01:20:53,308 --> 01:20:56,168
Do you understand? Excuse me, Mr. Yu.

2178
01:20:56,168 --> 01:20:57,338
Of course I do.

2179
01:20:57,338 --> 01:20:58,738
Just press anything.

2180
01:20:58,738 --> 01:21:00,838
(Do you even understand it?)

2181
01:21:02,038 --> 01:21:04,038
There's more English!

2182
01:21:06,208 --> 01:21:07,738
- Do we go to savings? - Checking.

2183
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:10,168
Isn't it checking...

2184
01:21:10,168 --> 01:21:11,638
- Account? - Yes.

2185
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:14,578
Why does it say, "respect"?

2186
01:21:15,668 --> 01:21:17,738
Seok Jin, that's not what it says.

2187
01:21:17,738 --> 01:21:19,168
It's "receipt".

2188
01:21:19,238 --> 01:21:20,968
My gosh. Did you say, "respect"?

2189
01:21:20,968 --> 01:21:22,308
That's what I thought it was.

2190
01:21:22,308 --> 01:21:23,608
What was that for?

2191
01:21:23,608 --> 01:21:25,078
Maybe they'll treat us nicely and respect us.

2192
01:21:25,078 --> 01:21:27,308
There are too many options. We just need our money.

2193
01:21:28,038 --> 01:21:29,578
- It worked. - Did it?

2194
01:21:30,438 --> 01:21:32,268
- What? - It's just a receipt.

2195
01:21:33,168 --> 01:21:34,508
I didn't want to check the balance.

2196
01:21:34,508 --> 01:21:36,838
(It prints the balance instead of withdrawing cash.)

2197
01:21:36,838 --> 01:21:37,908
Hold onto this.

2198
01:21:37,968 --> 01:21:40,308
Say yes. Don't you have to do that first?

2199
01:21:40,308 --> 01:21:41,938
Can we withdraw money here?

2200
01:21:41,938 --> 01:21:45,008
- You have to do it again. - My goodness.

2201
01:21:45,008 --> 01:21:46,368
- Let me try it. - Okay.

2202
01:21:46,638 --> 01:21:47,738
This...

2203
01:21:48,038 --> 01:21:50,538
- "Press if correct." - If it's correct...

2204
01:21:50,538 --> 01:21:51,938
Correct.

2205
01:21:51,938 --> 01:21:53,868
(They're not sure.)

2206
01:21:53,868 --> 01:21:55,268
- Press yes for everything? - Yes.

2207
01:21:56,368 --> 01:21:58,108
- Again? - It went back to the first page.

2208
01:21:58,438 --> 01:21:59,508
Move.

2209
01:21:59,508 --> 01:22:02,338
- Gosh, this is so annoying. - Let me see that.

2210
01:22:02,508 --> 01:22:03,868
I'm going to do this.

2211
01:22:03,868 --> 01:22:05,438
I don't know if we can do it.

2212
01:22:05,438 --> 01:22:07,578
My gosh. This is driving me nuts.

2213
01:22:08,838 --> 01:22:11,508
Okay. From checking account...

2214
01:22:11,508 --> 01:22:13,808
Try the checking account. We already tried savings.

2215
01:22:13,808 --> 01:22:16,138
This is to check your account. We have to press savings.

2216
01:22:16,508 --> 01:22:17,908
Don't you have to press the password?

2217
01:22:18,668 --> 01:22:21,168
- Wait. "Please enter..." - You have to enter something.

2218
01:22:21,168 --> 01:22:23,508
- I get it. - How much you want to withdraw?

2219
01:22:23,838 --> 01:22:25,138
Press 80,000.

2220
01:22:25,308 --> 01:22:27,078
- Press 8. - Ones, tens, hundreds, thousands...

2221
01:22:27,078 --> 01:22:28,308
Try 80,000.

2222
01:22:28,308 --> 01:22:30,338
- Let's try 80,000. - Try that.

2223
01:22:30,508 --> 01:22:31,868
There must be a limit.

2224
01:22:31,868 --> 01:22:34,468
- This... - It worked.

2225
01:22:34,508 --> 01:22:36,108
- Look. - I think it'll work.

2226
01:22:36,108 --> 01:22:37,508
- It's coming. - It is.

2227
01:22:37,938 --> 01:22:39,208
80,000 is not enough.

2228
01:22:39,208 --> 01:22:42,108
It's coming out!

2229
01:22:43,408 --> 01:22:44,638
Good job.

2230
01:22:44,638 --> 01:22:46,208
(It's like they won a lottery.)

2231
01:22:46,208 --> 01:22:47,308
It worked.

2232
01:22:47,608 --> 01:22:49,968
- It's coming out. - Let's see.

2233
01:22:49,968 --> 01:22:51,168
This is great.

2234
01:22:51,168 --> 01:22:52,668
- Jae Seok. - We did it.

2235
01:22:52,668 --> 01:22:54,638
You saw that, right?

2236
01:22:54,638 --> 01:22:57,108
(They're all amazed.)

2237
01:22:59,578 --> 01:23:00,738
Did you see that?

2238
01:23:00,738 --> 01:23:02,838
(He's proud of himself.)

2239
01:23:02,838 --> 01:23:04,538
Did you see that, Captain Song?

2240
01:23:04,538 --> 01:23:06,468
- Did you see the money come out? - This is no joke.

2241
01:23:06,468 --> 01:23:07,808
We're so happy.

2242
01:23:07,808 --> 01:23:09,308
Surviving in Mongolia.

2243
01:23:09,808 --> 01:23:11,408
This is our 1st day. 1 day.

2244
01:23:11,668 --> 01:23:15,708
First, withdrawing money from an ATM machine in Mongolia...

2245
01:23:15,708 --> 01:23:17,108
We finally did it.

2246
01:23:17,108 --> 01:23:18,868
- Look. - This is great.

2247
01:23:18,868 --> 01:23:21,638
- We did it. - We figured out the ATM.

2248
01:23:21,638 --> 01:23:22,708
(While Team Ji Hyo was struggling with the ATM machine,)

2249
01:23:22,708 --> 01:23:24,968
(Team Jong Kook is in Russia.)

2250
01:23:24,968 --> 01:23:27,608
Let's complete the mission today and take tomorrow off.

2251
01:23:27,638 --> 01:23:29,008
I think we are here.

2252
01:23:29,038 --> 01:23:30,038
Are we here?

2253
01:23:31,368 --> 01:23:33,208
It's the ATM.

2254
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:35,078
(They also try to withdraw money from the ATM first.)

2255
01:23:36,238 --> 01:23:37,638
(How much will this team struggle?)

2256
01:23:37,638 --> 01:23:38,708
There's the ATM machine.

2257
01:23:38,808 --> 01:23:40,138
- Let's go. - There it is.

2258
01:23:40,138 --> 01:23:42,668
Who would have imagined we'd be strolling in Russia?

2259
01:23:42,668 --> 01:23:45,078
How do we withdraw money? Do you know?

2260
01:23:45,078 --> 01:23:46,738
- Put the card in... - Put it in first.

2261
01:23:46,768 --> 01:23:49,368
The first icon on the left is always withdrawal.

2262
01:23:49,738 --> 01:23:51,008
- Is this right? - I think so.

2263
01:23:51,008 --> 01:23:52,208
(It's all Russian on the screen.)

2264
01:23:52,208 --> 01:23:53,268
Okay.

2265
01:23:53,968 --> 01:23:56,608
Wouldn't it tell us to select a language? English?

2266
01:23:58,768 --> 01:24:01,078
(It's all Russian.)

2267
01:24:02,338 --> 01:24:03,538
Password.

2268
01:24:05,038 --> 01:24:06,868
- Red. On the right. - That's not it.

2269
01:24:07,078 --> 01:24:08,538
- Which one is it? - Enter.

2270
01:24:09,108 --> 01:24:10,468
- Enter? - Yes.

2271
01:24:12,738 --> 01:24:13,738
- It worked. - It worked.

2272
01:24:13,738 --> 01:24:14,768
- How much was it again? - How much was it?

2273
01:24:14,768 --> 01:24:16,108
- 4... - 40,000...

2274
01:24:16,108 --> 01:24:18,038
This is 10,000. Do I press this 4 times?

2275
01:24:18,038 --> 01:24:19,268
- Isn't this "others"? - Others.

2276
01:24:19,268 --> 01:24:20,338
How?

2277
01:24:20,338 --> 01:24:21,538
Press it.

2278
01:24:21,538 --> 01:24:22,538
(Kwang Soo doesn't hesitate and presses the button.)

2279
01:24:22,538 --> 01:24:23,768
- It's right. - 10,000?

2280
01:24:24,108 --> 01:24:27,308
- 4... - 40,000.

2281
01:24:27,308 --> 01:24:28,578
Can we add another zero?

2282
01:24:28,638 --> 01:24:30,338
- Is this good? - Yes. Okay?

2283
01:24:30,508 --> 01:24:31,968
- It worked. - It worked.

2284
01:24:32,368 --> 01:24:33,938
- We did it in one try. - We did.

2285
01:24:34,578 --> 01:24:35,638
That's unbelievable.

2286
01:24:35,638 --> 01:24:37,168
I guess you've done this before.

2287
01:24:37,168 --> 01:24:38,578
- I haven't done this before. - I have.

2288
01:24:38,578 --> 01:24:40,738
You look like a Russian.

2289
01:24:40,738 --> 01:24:42,338
- You can trust me. - Thank you.

2290
01:24:43,438 --> 01:24:44,908
- This is awesome. - Okay.

2291
01:24:45,368 --> 01:24:46,808
- We did it right away. - We're so good in this.

2292
01:24:46,808 --> 01:24:48,868
- We're so good. - This is good.

2293
01:24:48,868 --> 01:24:51,008
It's like we live here.

2294
01:24:51,078 --> 01:24:53,938
My mother became a victim of a spam call not long ago,

2295
01:24:54,008 --> 01:24:55,338
so I'm little bit sensitive over these kinds of things.

2296
01:24:55,338 --> 01:24:57,268
We did it really easily.

2297
01:24:57,938 --> 01:24:59,768
- Let's... - We're one.

2298
01:24:59,768 --> 01:25:01,608
have one person be in charge. You can be the secretary.

2299
01:25:01,608 --> 01:25:02,838
Okay, I will.

2300
01:25:02,838 --> 01:25:05,738
If there's money missing, you're dead.

2301
01:25:05,838 --> 01:25:07,038
(Terrified)

2302
01:25:07,038 --> 01:25:08,238
- Okay, don't worry. - If there's money missing...

2303
01:25:08,238 --> 01:25:09,308
You become a king crab.

2304
01:25:09,308 --> 01:25:11,078
Just imagine living in the sea.

2305
01:25:11,868 --> 01:25:13,968
- Are you serious? - Deep in the water.

2306
01:25:13,968 --> 01:25:15,268
Hold it. Take good care of it.

2307
01:25:15,638 --> 01:25:17,368
(Trembling)

2308
01:25:18,338 --> 01:25:19,438
Are you crying?

2309
01:25:19,438 --> 01:25:21,808
- Are you crying? - Sorry? No, I'm okay.

2310
01:25:21,808 --> 01:25:23,468
He's still here, right?

2311
01:25:23,738 --> 01:25:25,078
I think I'll cry soon.

2312
01:25:25,608 --> 01:25:26,738
Where are we off to?

2313
01:25:26,738 --> 01:25:28,138
- The maritime park. - Maritime park?

2314
01:25:28,138 --> 01:25:29,438
- Let's go. - Are you certain?

2315
01:25:29,438 --> 01:25:30,508
- Okay, let's go. - Let's go.

2316
01:25:31,168 --> 01:25:32,438
Let's go to the maritime park.

2317
01:25:32,438 --> 01:25:34,008
We can do everything.

2318
01:25:34,008 --> 01:25:35,578
(They move in perfect order under the guide of Secretary Yang.)

2319
01:25:37,008 --> 01:25:38,768
- We have to go downtown first. - Downtown.

2320
01:25:38,768 --> 01:25:40,708
- Let's eat street food there. - Let's eat Russian food.

2321
01:25:40,708 --> 01:25:42,438
This place is famous.

2322
01:25:43,108 --> 01:25:45,638
They have lamb, pork, and veal.

2323
01:25:45,638 --> 01:25:47,938
It's the best shashlik restaurant.

2324
01:25:48,238 --> 01:25:50,008
- It sounds expensive. - That won't work.

2325
01:25:50,008 --> 01:25:52,708
We need some street food.

2326
01:25:52,708 --> 01:25:55,168
How's this? It's called pelmeni.

2327
01:25:55,238 --> 01:25:56,368
They're Russian dumplings.

2328
01:25:56,768 --> 01:25:58,868
- He doesn't eat dumplings. - He doesn't?

2329
01:25:58,868 --> 01:26:00,238
- Se Chan. - How's tornado potato?

2330
01:26:00,708 --> 01:26:03,238
It's fried so he won't eat it, Se Chan.

2331
01:26:03,238 --> 01:26:04,368
How's kebab?

2332
01:26:05,108 --> 01:26:06,738
I can't eat carbohydrates.

2333
01:26:07,108 --> 01:26:08,438
Ice cream?

2334
01:26:08,438 --> 01:26:09,578
Hey!

2335
01:26:09,578 --> 01:26:11,608
Wait. Give him one last chance.

2336
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:13,208
Then...

2337
01:26:14,268 --> 01:26:17,508
How's chicken breast salad?

2338
01:26:18,238 --> 01:26:19,968
- Let me see. - What's wrong?

2339
01:26:19,968 --> 01:26:21,768
- Are they known for it? - They are.

2340
01:26:21,768 --> 01:26:24,078
- Let me see. - Chicken breast is everywhere.

2341
01:26:24,238 --> 01:26:25,738
- They should have it. - Where?

2342
01:26:25,738 --> 01:26:27,968
- They have it. - Let me see the menu.

2343
01:26:28,538 --> 01:26:29,738
- Chicken breast is okay, right? - Yes.

2344
01:26:29,738 --> 01:26:30,838
- Let's go with that. - Sure.

2345
01:26:30,838 --> 01:26:32,838
I'll ask for chicken breast salad at a street food stand.

2346
01:26:32,838 --> 01:26:35,638
- You just have to say "Thank you." - Okay.

2347
01:26:35,708 --> 01:26:37,008
Is that okay?

2348
01:26:37,668 --> 01:26:39,168
- It's great. - Chicken breast salad.

2349
01:26:39,168 --> 01:26:40,508
Look to the left.

2350
01:26:40,838 --> 01:26:42,368
Is that where we are headed?

2351
01:26:43,168 --> 01:26:44,338
("Fantastic Duo 2" in a moment)

2352
01:26:44,608 --> 01:26:46,138
(Find Rising Diva Ailee's fantastic duo.)

2353
01:26:46,138 --> 01:26:49,008
(Ailee becomes excited over how skilled the contestants are.)

2354
01:26:49,008 --> 01:26:53,008
(In Soon I and Ailee will have their final match!)

2355
01:26:53,038 --> 01:26:54,938
(It will air shortly.)

2356
01:26:55,368 --> 01:26:56,368
Look to the left.

2357
01:26:57,068 --> 01:26:58,568
That's the sea, right?

2358
01:26:58,568 --> 01:27:00,638
- This is so pretty. - I see the sand.

2359
01:27:00,638 --> 01:27:01,768
- The sand. - The sand.

2360
01:27:01,838 --> 01:27:03,938
Usually, it's white, sandy beach,

2361
01:27:04,208 --> 01:27:08,968
but the beach here is surrounded with the field.

2362
01:27:08,968 --> 01:27:10,008
(The Northeast Sea meets the field.)

2363
01:27:10,008 --> 01:27:12,438
Hey, it's not cold here. This is so interesting.

2364
01:27:12,438 --> 01:27:14,068
(They follow the coast road...)

2365
01:27:14,068 --> 01:27:17,008
(and slowly get closer to the center of the city in Vladivostok.)

2366
01:27:17,368 --> 01:27:18,868
I think we are close to the city center.

2367
01:27:19,208 --> 01:27:20,508
We are in downtown now.

2368
01:27:20,668 --> 01:27:22,568
Now, I see some fancy buildings.

2369
01:27:22,568 --> 01:27:24,168
I can see big buildings now.

2370
01:27:24,168 --> 01:27:26,938
Look at the buildings. The buildings have been preserved from long ago.

2371
01:27:26,938 --> 01:27:28,208
I do feel like I'm in a foreign country.

2372
01:27:28,338 --> 01:27:30,038
Goodness. What is that?

2373
01:27:30,038 --> 01:27:31,938
(They arrive at a maritime park.)

2374
01:27:33,968 --> 01:27:40,708
(Couples and families visit here for the sea and cultural attractions.)

2375
01:27:40,708 --> 01:27:41,938
- Everyone. - Yes?

2376
01:27:41,938 --> 01:27:42,968
Let's get going.

2377
01:27:42,968 --> 01:27:44,538
(It is famous for various kinds of food and beautiful scenery.)

2378
01:27:45,008 --> 01:27:47,868
First, let's head there...

2379
01:27:47,868 --> 01:27:49,568
- Okay. - and get something to eat.

2380
01:27:49,568 --> 01:27:51,108
- This street is pretty. - Gosh, this looks cool.

2381
01:27:51,108 --> 01:27:52,468
Gosh, how pretty.

2382
01:27:52,468 --> 01:27:53,968
This is a beautiful city.

2383
01:27:53,968 --> 01:27:57,468
Vladivostok's animal symbol is a tiger.

2384
01:27:57,468 --> 01:27:58,838
They are two baby tigers.

2385
01:27:58,838 --> 01:28:00,808
- I should take a photo. - Let's take a photo.

2386
01:28:00,808 --> 01:28:01,868
- Jong Kook. - Okay.

2387
01:28:01,868 --> 01:28:03,738
We will start taking photos. Jong Kook, you're first.

2388
01:28:03,738 --> 01:28:05,208
Jong Kook will take his photo first.

2389
01:28:05,208 --> 01:28:07,768
- We will start with you. - Okay. I'll go first.

2390
01:28:08,068 --> 01:28:09,338
- All right. - Gosh, they're so cute.

2391
01:28:09,338 --> 01:28:11,938
Look at the camera. In 1, 2, 3.

2392
01:28:12,268 --> 01:28:14,938
(Reunion of a Separated Family?)

2393
01:28:15,738 --> 01:28:17,638
Jong Kook, can I take a selfie with you?

2394
01:28:17,638 --> 01:28:18,638
- Sure. - Let me take one too.

2395
01:28:18,638 --> 01:28:20,508
(I want to take a photo with Jong Kook.)

2396
01:28:21,968 --> 01:28:23,108
I want to take one with him.

2397
01:28:23,108 --> 01:28:25,908
In 1, 2, 3.

2398
01:28:25,968 --> 01:28:28,938
(I Am Jong Kook's Right Hand Man!)

2399
01:28:29,838 --> 01:28:31,368
- Should we go there? - No, there's no such thing.

2400
01:28:31,368 --> 01:28:32,768
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

2401
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:33,968
(I'm excited.)

2402
01:28:35,338 --> 01:28:37,168
(They start humming a Russian folk song.)

2403
01:28:38,438 --> 01:28:40,268
Do it right here.

2404
01:28:40,268 --> 01:28:41,508
It's just like Tetris.

2405
01:28:41,738 --> 01:28:44,568
(Haha, you are so good!)

2406
01:28:44,568 --> 01:28:45,608
I'm so excited!

2407
01:28:47,768 --> 01:28:50,838
(We are not done yet.)

2408
01:28:50,838 --> 01:28:53,068
(They start dancing right away at the sound of music.)

2409
01:28:54,608 --> 01:28:57,968
(Jong Kook, I am your right hand man, aren't I?)

2410
01:28:59,368 --> 01:29:01,838
(This is a dance competition to win over Jong Kook's heart.)

2411
01:29:01,838 --> 01:29:03,508
Haha, you are not doing your best.

2412
01:29:03,738 --> 01:29:05,808
- Didn't Haha do his best? - No, I did my best.

2413
01:29:06,168 --> 01:29:07,508
I think...

2414
01:29:07,908 --> 01:29:09,838
there is another mission.

2415
01:29:09,908 --> 01:29:11,168
- I agree. - I feel dizzy.

2416
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:12,568
Can we take a break?

2417
01:29:12,568 --> 01:29:13,568
- Wait. - This is too much.

2418
01:29:13,568 --> 01:29:15,808
- I think I'm about to cry. - He's way over the line.

2419
01:29:16,768 --> 01:29:18,208
What should we eat?

2420
01:29:18,868 --> 01:29:20,908
I'm sort of craving chicken breast salad.

2421
01:29:22,668 --> 01:29:24,968
(It's difficult to please Jong Kook.)

2422
01:29:26,638 --> 01:29:28,208
I want to eat something.

2423
01:29:28,708 --> 01:29:30,368
Shall we go into a restaurant?

2424
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,538
All right. Let's do that, Jong Kook.

2425
01:29:31,538 --> 01:29:34,138
- This one serves chicken and pork. - I think there's chicken breast.

2426
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:35,968
- Look at that. - Is there a toilet around here?

2427
01:29:36,108 --> 01:29:37,268
- Hey, find a toilet. - That's shrimp.

2428
01:29:37,268 --> 01:29:38,438
I see one right there.

2429
01:29:38,438 --> 01:29:40,208
- I will be back. - Okay, Jong Kook.

2430
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:41,338
Hey, you guys are...

2431
01:29:41,468 --> 01:29:43,408
Hey, Jong Kook is going to the toilet.

2432
01:29:43,568 --> 01:29:45,268
- One of you should come with me. - I'll go with you.

2433
01:29:45,268 --> 01:29:46,408
Kwang Soo, come with me.

2434
01:29:46,468 --> 01:29:48,438
Let's go. Gosh, this looks great.

2435
01:29:48,438 --> 01:29:50,268
Jong Kook, you made your decision, right?

2436
01:29:50,338 --> 01:29:51,908
- What? - You made your decision, right?

2437
01:29:51,908 --> 01:29:54,808
I can't make it now. I have to make it at the end.

2438
01:29:55,108 --> 01:29:56,368
I can't decide now.

2439
01:29:56,468 --> 01:29:58,408
- "Toilet" - This way, sir.

2440
01:29:59,068 --> 01:30:00,068
(I will polish the path for you.)

2441
01:30:00,068 --> 01:30:02,108
- Isn't this for the ladies? - No, this is for men.

2442
01:30:02,938 --> 01:30:06,168
- This is a unisex, public toilet. - I think we have to pay for this.

2443
01:30:06,938 --> 01:30:10,638
(No way! Someone is coming.)

2444
01:30:10,638 --> 01:30:11,638
Do we have to pay?

2445
01:30:12,068 --> 01:30:15,538
(This is a problem. Jong Kook already went in.)

2446
01:30:17,108 --> 01:30:18,568
(He's about to pay 40 cents.)

2447
01:30:18,568 --> 01:30:20,068
2? 20?

2448
01:30:20,068 --> 01:30:21,068
Twenty.

2449
01:30:22,468 --> 01:30:24,068
I am not using the toilet. Someone is already inside.

2450
01:30:24,068 --> 01:30:25,138
I am not using it.

2451
01:30:26,308 --> 01:30:29,108
He went in because it was urgent.

2452
01:30:29,108 --> 01:30:31,068
(She must have experienced this often.)

2453
01:30:31,538 --> 01:30:33,068
- We have to pay, right? - Yes.

2454
01:30:33,838 --> 01:30:34,838
Se Chan!

2455
01:30:34,838 --> 01:30:36,208
(Se Chan, help us!)

2456
01:30:36,208 --> 01:30:38,508
Se Chan, please give me some money.

2457
01:30:38,568 --> 01:30:41,138
- Why? - You have to pay for the toilet.

2458
01:30:41,268 --> 01:30:42,368
- Really? - I need 40 cents.

2459
01:30:42,368 --> 01:30:43,368
Seriously?

2460
01:30:43,968 --> 01:30:45,968
- Hey. - 40 cents? Hold on.

2461
01:30:45,968 --> 01:30:47,168
(I can't believe we spent money on toilet.)

2462
01:30:48,708 --> 01:30:49,968
Run, run!

2463
01:30:50,338 --> 01:30:52,168
For how long do we have to keep this up?

2464
01:30:52,168 --> 01:30:53,168
Will it last for two days?

2465
01:30:53,908 --> 01:30:56,838
Do we have to spend two days working like a dog for him?

2466
01:30:57,868 --> 01:31:01,438
(They paid 40 cents because Jong Kook had to use the toilet.)

2467
01:31:01,868 --> 01:31:03,268
- Bye. - Bye. But this...

2468
01:31:03,268 --> 01:31:05,168
I should hold it if I can.

2469
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:07,168
I should have held it in and gone to the toilet at once.

2470
01:31:07,338 --> 01:31:08,468
- Haha. - Should we ask him?

2471
01:31:08,468 --> 01:31:10,108
- Can you help us? - The king crab!

2472
01:31:10,108 --> 01:31:11,868
- How do I say, "Please help us." - Show him the pictures.

2473
01:31:12,668 --> 01:31:16,338
(Please help us catch king crabs.)

2474
01:31:16,338 --> 01:31:17,968
- King crabs. - We want to fish for king crabs.

2475
01:31:20,068 --> 01:31:22,208
(Russky Island)

2476
01:31:22,208 --> 01:31:24,438
(We should go to Russky Island?)

2477
01:31:25,108 --> 01:31:26,438
- What? - Isn't that an island?

2478
01:31:26,438 --> 01:31:27,908
- It's an island, right? - Russky...

2479
01:31:27,908 --> 01:31:29,008
(If they go to the island...)

2480
01:31:29,008 --> 01:31:30,768
- It's called Russky Island. - Hey.

2481
01:31:31,368 --> 01:31:34,808
(Will they be able to accomplish their mission?)

2482
01:31:36,108 --> 01:31:39,908
(Vladivostok in Russia)

2483
01:31:40,938 --> 01:31:43,538
(It's their last struggle before they go on the dangerous trip.)

2484
01:31:43,538 --> 01:31:45,968
(If you want to come out alive, survive the tough sea of Russia!)

2485
01:31:47,538 --> 01:31:49,638
(And)

2486
01:31:49,638 --> 01:31:52,908
(Are they crying in the sea?)

2487
01:31:54,068 --> 01:31:58,168
(Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia)

2488
01:31:59,108 --> 01:32:02,368
(In the midst of this vast field in Mongolia,)

2489
01:32:02,368 --> 01:32:05,208
(they have to find the descendants of Genghis Khan.)

2490
01:32:05,208 --> 01:32:06,908
Didn't we fail the mission?

2491
01:32:06,908 --> 01:32:08,768
Where did it go?

2492
01:32:09,068 --> 01:32:10,668
(This is the unprecedented, ultimate mission.)

2493
01:32:10,838 --> 01:32:11,968
Didn't we fail?

2494
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:13,068
Sheep!

2495
01:32:13,068 --> 01:32:14,908
(Seize the last opportunity...)

2496
01:32:14,908 --> 01:32:17,268
(to avoid going on the Dangerous Trip.)

2497
01:32:18,708 --> 01:32:22,068
(Last Chance in Mongolia and Russia)

2498
01:32:23,468 --> 01:32:25,708
(Ji Hyo and So Min get to spend time together.)

2499
01:32:26,838 --> 01:32:29,338
(So Min,)

2500
01:32:29,338 --> 01:32:32,168
(you are so cheerful and positive.)

2501
01:32:32,468 --> 01:32:34,568
(No, that's not true, Ji Hyo.)

2502
01:32:34,568 --> 01:32:36,738
(I am very pessimistic.)

2503
01:32:37,168 --> 01:32:41,438
(It's the end of a tough day on an unfamiliar land.)

2504
01:32:41,668 --> 01:32:44,938
(They sincerely share their feelings.)

2505
01:32:44,938 --> 01:32:49,068
(This is a special story between Ji Hyo and So Min.)

2506
01:32:49,438 --> 01:32:52,738
(We will tell you this story next Sunday.)

2507
01:32:55,938 --> 01:32:56,968
(The 2nd project of the global project)

2508
01:32:56,968 --> 01:33:04,968
(Recommend a destination! Members will go to the destination!)

2509
01:33:07,108 --> 01:33:12,038
(Running Man will air next Sunday)
