00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,670
(2017 Running Man's Second Global Project)

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,840
(People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent)

3
00:00:11,586 --> 00:00:15,386
(Travel destinations for 1 percent pour in from around the world.)

4
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:18,816
(Running Man will visit the place only 1 percent recommended.)

5
00:00:19,856 --> 00:00:24,286
(The member with 3 I Go Stickers will go to a place for the 1 percent.)

6
00:00:24,286 --> 00:00:27,856
(Avoid I Go Sticker to avoid going on an adventure.)

7
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:31,186
(The 1st Place Tour in Tokyo)

8
00:00:31,186 --> 00:00:33,486
(Jae Seok dreamt of being a king.)

9
00:00:33,486 --> 00:00:35,786
(Haha and So Min followed him.)

10
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,856
(Jae Seok rose above his bad luck and took the throne.)

11
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:41,886
(He was given the right to assign the members to the sides of a dice.)

12
00:00:41,886 --> 00:00:44,257
(King, please look over us.)

13
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:47,116
I will assign my team mates to six.

14
00:00:47,686 --> 00:00:50,186
(Jae Seok ends up giving Haha and So Min I Go Stickers.)

15
00:00:50,186 --> 00:00:51,886
- Viewers, look at what... - You jerk!

16
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:52,986
(Today, )

17
00:00:54,186 --> 00:00:56,756
(a suspicious race will unfold.)

18
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:57,986
(A suspicious member)

19
00:00:57,986 --> 00:00:59,456
(A suspicious mission)

20
00:00:59,716 --> 00:01:00,716
(And a suspicious...)

21
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:02,016
(reaction)

22
00:01:02,016 --> 00:01:03,086
(A suspicious dance...)

23
00:01:03,086 --> 00:01:04,686
(and a suspicious charm)

24
00:01:04,686 --> 00:01:06,716
(A very suspicious race will unfold today.)

25
00:01:07,616 --> 00:01:11,886
(They spent the spring of 2017 with Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

26
00:01:11,886 --> 00:01:14,882
(The refreshing summer approaches.)

27
00:01:14,977 --> 00:01:15,977
You know,

28
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:19,777
it's still early in the morning.

29
00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:23,977
I am still recuperating from Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.

30
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:27,407
I am serious. What is going on?

31
00:01:27,407 --> 00:01:28,407
(Where are the other members?)

32
00:01:28,507 --> 00:01:29,507
(Annoyed)

33
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:31,607
Gosh, I can't believe Jae Seok.

34
00:01:31,607 --> 00:01:32,777
(Resentful)

35
00:01:33,347 --> 00:01:34,677
I made him the king.

36
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,877
(He repaid me with an I Go Sticker.)

37
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:40,547
I will be likely to go if I get another I Go Sticker.

38
00:01:40,547 --> 00:01:41,607
This is a race for I Go Stickers, right?

39
00:01:41,647 --> 00:01:42,647
You are right.

40
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:44,477
(What could be today's race for I Go Sticker?)

41
00:01:44,977 --> 00:01:46,677
(This place looks familiar.)

42
00:01:46,677 --> 00:01:48,077
(It's Se Chan's place.)

43
00:01:48,077 --> 00:01:49,247
(The producer aims to make a surprise visit.)

44
00:01:49,607 --> 00:01:50,647
My goodness.

45
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,547
(Who is he?)

46
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:53,577
Gosh, you startled me.

47
00:01:53,577 --> 00:01:54,877
- My goodness. - You startled me.

48
00:01:54,877 --> 00:01:55,877
Hello.

49
00:01:55,877 --> 00:01:57,007
I am here to see Se Chan.

50
00:01:57,007 --> 00:01:58,147
He will be out shortly.

51
00:01:58,147 --> 00:01:59,907
Okay. I am sorry.

52
00:01:59,907 --> 00:02:01,107
It's okay.

53
00:02:01,607 --> 00:02:03,707
I startled you.

54
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:04,707
(The person they were looking for comes out.)

55
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:07,607
For goodness' sake. What is it this time?

56
00:02:08,047 --> 00:02:09,147
You met my brother, right?

57
00:02:09,147 --> 00:02:11,347
We surprised each other.

58
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:12,347
(After the surprise visit, )

59
00:02:12,347 --> 00:02:15,677
(they go to where actresses doll up, Chungdam-dong shop.)

60
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:19,477
(Which muse will we meet here? Ji Hyo or So Min?)

61
00:02:22,907 --> 00:02:24,147
(Kwang Soo appears mid-transformation.)

62
00:02:24,147 --> 00:02:25,277
- Hello. - Hello.

63
00:02:27,577 --> 00:02:28,777
(His eyes are puffy.)

64
00:02:28,777 --> 00:02:30,207
What are you doing?

65
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:32,577
(I can't believe you followed me to the beauty shop.)

66
00:02:32,577 --> 00:02:34,547
- Please take this. - Okay.

67
00:02:35,347 --> 00:02:36,677
We are starting the race separately.

68
00:02:36,677 --> 00:02:38,377
Yes. Today, the race...

69
00:02:39,077 --> 00:02:40,677
- starts here. - Does it start here?

70
00:02:40,677 --> 00:02:41,747
Yes, it does.

71
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:45,947
Where are the members? Why am I getting this alone?

72
00:02:46,977 --> 00:02:47,977
What is this?

73
00:02:48,477 --> 00:02:49,507
It's a mission.

74
00:02:49,647 --> 00:02:51,077
A Mission for the Acquisition of Money.

75
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:52,577
"A Propitious Place for 1 Percent".

76
00:02:52,647 --> 00:02:55,577
"At exits 1 through 8 of Seoul's elevated park..."

77
00:02:55,577 --> 00:02:58,377
"are different amounts of money for the mission."

78
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:01,247
"Exit 1, 40 dollars. Exit 2, 3, and 4, 50 dollars."

79
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:03,907
"Exit 5, 6, and 7, 70 dollars. Exit 8, 100 dollars."

80
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:06,177
"Among exits 1 through 8,"

81
00:03:06,177 --> 00:03:09,047
"choose a number of your liking and gather around by 9:30am."

82
00:03:09,277 --> 00:03:13,177
"However, the money will be divided among the members at the exit."

83
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:14,877
The money will be divided?

84
00:03:14,877 --> 00:03:15,877
(If it overlaps?)

85
00:03:15,877 --> 00:03:17,077
If two members come to the same exit...

86
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:19,447
The money will be divided.

87
00:03:19,477 --> 00:03:21,547
(If the exits overlap, the money will be divided.)

88
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:23,877
(It's a battle of psychology.)

89
00:03:24,047 --> 00:03:25,877
The money you acquire...

90
00:03:25,877 --> 00:03:28,077
will play a big role on the outcome of today's race.

91
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:30,677
- Really? - Choose an exit and let us know...

92
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,607
five minutes prior to your arrival.

93
00:03:35,377 --> 00:03:37,677
(Today's race will take place at Seoul-Ro.)

94
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:42,547
(The money will be divided if other members show up.)

95
00:03:42,547 --> 00:03:45,247
(To avoid getting I Go Stickers, choose an exit no one will go to.)

96
00:03:45,247 --> 00:03:46,377
(40 dollars)

97
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:49,077
(50 dollars, 70 dollars, 100 dollars)

98
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:52,377
(To avoid sharing, keep the others from coming to your exit.)

99
00:03:52,377 --> 00:03:53,577
I will kill you if you come.

100
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:56,077
(A shallow, psychological warfare and the clumsy tactics fill...)

101
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:59,447
(A War for the Money, A Propitious Place for 1 Percent)

102
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,507
(Who will emerge victorious?)

103
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,077
"The money will be divided"?

104
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:07,077
Wait a minute.

105
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:10,707
That means everyone might go to exit eight.

106
00:04:10,707 --> 00:04:11,907
How many members are there?

107
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:13,677
(Let me think.)

108
00:04:15,077 --> 00:04:16,077
There are nine members, right?

109
00:04:16,147 --> 00:04:17,477
(She counts with her fingers in a unique way.)

110
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:20,007
- There are eight members. - I am sorry.

111
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:23,607
Since there are 8 members, 100 dollars will be...

112
00:04:23,907 --> 00:04:25,247
- divided by eight. - Yes.

113
00:04:25,247 --> 00:04:26,247
Then...

114
00:04:26,247 --> 00:04:28,877
(100,000 divided by 8 is...)

115
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:30,677
(Well, )

116
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:32,447
(let me think.)

117
00:04:32,747 --> 00:04:34,477
Why don't you do it on the road?

118
00:04:34,477 --> 00:04:36,747
- May I decide on my way there? - Yes.

119
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:39,477
Let's go. Let's go.

120
00:04:40,577 --> 00:04:42,447
They want us to use our brains again.

121
00:04:43,147 --> 00:04:44,147
The money will be divided.

122
00:04:44,147 --> 00:04:45,907
(He acts like he has used his brain before.)

123
00:04:45,907 --> 00:04:47,877
Exit one won't be a bad choice.

124
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:51,147
Maybe I should choose among exits 5, 6, and 7.

125
00:04:52,477 --> 00:04:55,677
There are members who are bound to aim for 100 dollars.

126
00:04:57,577 --> 00:04:59,577
Wouldn't it be best to go to exit eight?

127
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:03,377
An idea hit my head like a lightning.

128
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:05,817
It occurred to me that I should go to exit eight no matter what.

129
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:07,777
It's an instinct.

130
00:05:07,777 --> 00:05:10,177
Everyone else might go for exits 5, 6, and 7,

131
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:13,247
but I have this strong feeling that I must choose exit eight.

132
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:16,277
Kwang Soo and Jae Seok will choose exit eight for certain.

133
00:05:17,347 --> 00:05:19,247
They're like moths attracted to flames.

134
00:05:19,547 --> 00:05:22,207
It is for certain that So Min,

135
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:25,947
Jae Seok, and Kwang Soo will go for exit eight.

136
00:05:26,647 --> 00:05:28,207
These moths are hard to deal with.

137
00:05:28,477 --> 00:05:30,677
I should carry a bug spray and exterminate them.

138
00:05:31,577 --> 00:05:35,607
(How will these moths' choices turn out?)

139
00:05:36,847 --> 00:05:39,807
(Jae Seok is calling someone.)

140
00:05:40,277 --> 00:05:41,377
Hi, Jae Seok.

141
00:05:41,377 --> 00:05:43,307
- Hi, Kwang Soo. - Hey.

142
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:44,477
Where are you?

143
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,207
I'm on my way to exit one now.

144
00:05:46,907 --> 00:05:49,407
- You're going to exit one? - Yes.

145
00:05:49,777 --> 00:05:52,677
I guess you're thinking of choosing exit eight.

146
00:05:52,777 --> 00:05:55,007
You'll head there first and size the situation up, right?

147
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:58,507
(They know each other too well.)

148
00:05:58,947 --> 00:06:00,607
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

149
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:02,947
I'll tell you flat out honest. I'm going for 100 dollars.

150
00:06:03,777 --> 00:06:05,177
(Disappointed)

151
00:06:05,177 --> 00:06:06,307
So don't come.

152
00:06:06,447 --> 00:06:08,247
I'm warning you not to come.

153
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:11,207
Jae Seok, we're thinking exactly the same way.

154
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:12,877
- Jae Seok. - Kwang Soo.

155
00:06:12,877 --> 00:06:16,107
I know several of us are like moths attracted to flames.

156
00:06:16,107 --> 00:06:17,277
Go ahead and come if you want.

157
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:19,407
We'll have to split the amount, just so you know.

158
00:06:19,407 --> 00:06:20,947
Let's meet up at exit eight then.

159
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,347
Sure, let's do it.

160
00:06:22,447 --> 00:06:24,007
I'm on my way now.

161
00:06:24,107 --> 00:06:25,947
- Okay. - All right, see you there.

162
00:06:25,947 --> 00:06:28,177
- Hey, let's hurry to exit eight. - Hurry there.

163
00:06:28,247 --> 00:06:30,277
- I'll see you there soon. - Okay.

164
00:06:30,277 --> 00:06:31,307
(They act confidently.)

165
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:34,577
Is he going for certain?

166
00:06:34,577 --> 00:06:36,047
(He feels intimidated as soon as he hangs up.)

167
00:06:36,777 --> 00:06:37,907
(He calls another member.)

168
00:06:37,907 --> 00:06:39,177
- Hi, Kwang Soo. - Hey.

169
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:40,947
Where will you go?

170
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:43,177
I'm on my way to exit six for now.

171
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:46,477
Gosh, whatever.

172
00:06:48,247 --> 00:06:50,277
Stop acting because it's not working.

173
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:51,447
I'm not acting.

174
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:53,877
I only said I'm on my way to exit six. Where are you now?

175
00:06:54,177 --> 00:06:57,407
You're going for exit eight, right?

176
00:06:58,677 --> 00:06:59,947
(Gulping)

177
00:07:00,077 --> 00:07:01,147
- Hello? - Well...

178
00:07:02,077 --> 00:07:04,377
Why do you think so?

179
00:07:04,377 --> 00:07:05,507
I know you're heading there too.

180
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:07,477
Of course, I'm going there.

181
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:09,477
I'm going there too, but don't come.

182
00:07:10,107 --> 00:07:11,507
I'm telling you now. Don't come.

183
00:07:11,507 --> 00:07:13,577
I'm going no matter what.

184
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:15,777
(Sighing)

185
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:18,477
- You sound so sure. - Let's hang up for now.

186
00:07:18,477 --> 00:07:20,577
- Jae Seok's calling me. - Okay.

187
00:07:22,347 --> 00:07:23,907
Hi, Jae Seok.

188
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:26,707
- Hi, So Min. - Where are you going?

189
00:07:26,977 --> 00:07:29,977
I'm warning you not to come to exit eight because I'm going there now.

190
00:07:30,777 --> 00:07:32,507
I'll see you at exit eight.

191
00:07:32,507 --> 00:07:33,807
(She ignores his warning.)

192
00:07:33,907 --> 00:07:35,807
- What did you say? - I'll see you there.

193
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:38,047
I just told you I'm on my way there.

194
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:40,047
- All right, see you soon. - So Min.

195
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:42,447
- What? - Will you keep doing this?

196
00:07:42,607 --> 00:07:44,347
- What do you mean? - I said I'm going there.

197
00:07:44,707 --> 00:07:46,577
Okay, I'll see you there.

198
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:49,247
My goodness. She's not listening to me.

199
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:52,347
- Why aren't you listening to me? - Anyway,

200
00:07:52,677 --> 00:07:54,007
I'll see you later.

201
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,707
All right, come then.

202
00:07:55,707 --> 00:07:56,747
(So Min will be there for certain.)

203
00:07:57,207 --> 00:07:59,407
(Ji Hyo tries to call So Min who never listens to others.)

204
00:07:59,407 --> 00:08:00,507
Hi, So Min.

205
00:08:00,507 --> 00:08:01,907
Ji Hyo, where are you going?

206
00:08:01,907 --> 00:08:03,047
(Straightforward)

207
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:04,347
What about you?

208
00:08:04,977 --> 00:08:06,147
I'm going to exit eight now.

209
00:08:06,147 --> 00:08:07,877
(She's going to exit eight.)

210
00:08:07,877 --> 00:08:08,947
Gosh,

211
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,007
you're just going there even if you can't earn any, right?

212
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:13,607
- Hi, Seok Jin. - Hi, Ji Hyo.

213
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:15,177
Where are you now?

214
00:08:15,177 --> 00:08:17,907
I'm on my way to exit eight now.

215
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:19,577
(Seok Jin is also going to exit 8.)

216
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:21,807
(Laughing)

217
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:23,277
Have you decided on it already?

218
00:08:23,907 --> 00:08:25,407
- Hi, Ji Hyo. - Hi, Jong Kook.

219
00:08:26,077 --> 00:08:28,407
So are you going to exit eight too?

220
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:31,277
You know I don't make risky choices.

221
00:08:31,507 --> 00:08:33,507
- Which exit are you headed to? - Exit five.

222
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,307
Exit five?

223
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:37,047
Okay, I'll never go to exit five.

224
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:39,307
- Don't come for certain. - All right, I promise.

225
00:08:39,307 --> 00:08:41,777
I'll kill you if you come.

226
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:44,147
How could you say that?

227
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:46,947
You have so many other expressions, but how could you say you'd kill me?

228
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:48,477
Isn't that inappropriate for TV shows?

229
00:08:48,477 --> 00:08:50,377
You could've said, "I won't forgive you," or something like that.

230
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:52,877
- I won't forgive you. - "I won't forgive you if you come."

231
00:08:52,977 --> 00:08:54,607
But "I'll kill you" is just inappropriate.

232
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:56,077
I won't forgive you.

233
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,247
(Anyway, I won't forgive you.)

234
00:08:57,747 --> 00:08:59,077
- Hello? - Hey, Se Chan.

235
00:08:59,177 --> 00:09:00,347
Hi, Haha.

236
00:09:00,847 --> 00:09:03,347
Be honest and tell me where you're headed.

237
00:09:03,607 --> 00:09:04,747
I'm going for exit five.

238
00:09:05,147 --> 00:09:06,247
- Exit five? - Yes.

239
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:08,707
(Haha and Se Chan share strong faith in each other.)

240
00:09:08,707 --> 00:09:12,847
(They went fishing together early in the morning in Russia.)

241
00:09:12,847 --> 00:09:15,007
(I'm proud of you, Se Chan!)

242
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,277
(They grew a strong bond by catching pollack that day.)

243
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:22,507
(Haha is willing to share important information with Se Chan.)

244
00:09:22,507 --> 00:09:26,417
Just keep in mind that many of our members are going for exit eight.

245
00:09:26,547 --> 00:09:28,347
Really? I see, so that place is like a rest stop.

246
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:30,747
Are you going there though? That's what's important.

247
00:09:30,747 --> 00:09:33,047
Choose among exits 5, 6, or 7.

248
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,577
- Exits 5, 6, or 7? - I'll be in exits 2, 3, or 4.

249
00:09:35,647 --> 00:09:37,877
This is what I like about you. Your leadership.

250
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:40,107
You're going through a lot today.

251
00:09:40,207 --> 00:09:42,307
Not at all. It's you who are going through a lot.

252
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,047
Gosh, our super rookie.

253
00:09:44,047 --> 00:09:45,707
(He's proud of Se Chan.)

254
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,847
Haha, let's not run into each other.

255
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,647
- All right. - Bye!

256
00:09:51,577 --> 00:09:54,447
- Wasn't it suspicious? - I could sense he would betray me.

257
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:56,807
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

258
00:09:57,377 --> 00:09:59,547
Whenever I talk to someone like him on the phone,

259
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:01,247
I don't feel like I had a conversation.

260
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:03,377
(He tries calling another member like Se Chan.)

261
00:10:03,377 --> 00:10:04,417
Kwang Soo.

262
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:06,077
- Hi, Haha. - Hi.

263
00:10:06,377 --> 00:10:08,147
His voice is so scary.

264
00:10:08,347 --> 00:10:10,507
- Seriously. - What are you talking about?

265
00:10:10,947 --> 00:10:12,977
So say what you want to say.

266
00:10:13,677 --> 00:10:15,177
I'll go for exit eight.

267
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:17,347
I don't intend to avoid running into you.

268
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:19,607
How about we all gather at exit eight then?

269
00:10:19,607 --> 00:10:22,247
Look at him. He's playing for high stakes now.

270
00:10:22,577 --> 00:10:25,377
Are you trying to instigate me from the morning?

271
00:10:27,107 --> 00:10:28,977
- Hi, Jae Seok. - Hi, Haha.

272
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:31,247
Thanks for the Sticker last week.

273
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:32,707
Goodness, Haha.

274
00:10:32,977 --> 00:10:34,747
From early in the morning,

275
00:10:35,277 --> 00:10:36,847
I'm very much motivated.

276
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:38,947
Listen to my determined voice.

277
00:10:39,447 --> 00:10:40,707
Are you saying you'll go for exit eight?

278
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:41,747
What?

279
00:10:41,747 --> 00:10:43,347
(He only cares about which exit Haha will choose to go.)

280
00:10:45,147 --> 00:10:47,947
(Why is everyone talking about exit 8?)

281
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,507
You guys are so suffocating.

282
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:50,707
I made my decision...

283
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:53,107
as soon as I received the mission for today.

284
00:10:53,107 --> 00:10:55,147
- Do you get it? - Gosh, seriously.

285
00:10:55,147 --> 00:10:56,347
You know me.

286
00:10:56,347 --> 00:10:58,007
You know me, right?

287
00:10:58,047 --> 00:11:00,877
You know what happens if I go crazy about something.

288
00:11:00,947 --> 00:11:02,007
Hold on.

289
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:04,047
Okay, I get it.

290
00:11:04,177 --> 00:11:06,077
I don't think we need to talk any further.

291
00:11:06,177 --> 00:11:07,647
- Okay. - Okay.

292
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:10,047
Is he serious or what?

293
00:11:10,247 --> 00:11:11,877
What on earth is going on?

294
00:11:11,877 --> 00:11:12,977
(He's frustrated.)

295
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:14,107
I should call So Min.

296
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,377
(He'll decide after calling So Min.)

297
00:11:17,707 --> 00:11:20,247
- Hi, Haha. - Good to hear your bright voice.

298
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:22,107
Thanks, are you on your way to exit eight?

299
00:11:22,107 --> 00:11:23,207
(Out of the blue)

300
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:24,307
It's so tiring.

301
00:11:24,307 --> 00:11:26,247
Gosh, this is just so tiring.

302
00:11:26,377 --> 00:11:27,447
So Min.

303
00:11:27,607 --> 00:11:29,447
- It's exit eight, right? - So Min.

304
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:30,907
I'm so tired.

305
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:35,707
Okay, I'll see you at exit eight then.

306
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:37,607
(Please stop now.)

307
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:38,707
See you soon.

308
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:41,477
Five of us will get to split the money.

309
00:11:41,477 --> 00:11:44,807
Gosh, she's giving me goosebumps.

310
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:47,747
- Se Chan, Jae Seok, Kwang Soo, - Gosh, I'm getting goosebumps.

311
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,907
- Seok Jin, and me. - So Min, I'm so tired now.

312
00:11:52,507 --> 00:11:54,247
So Min, I can't stand this anymore.

313
00:11:54,407 --> 00:11:56,607
Okay, I'll see you there.

314
00:11:56,707 --> 00:11:57,777
So Min!

315
00:11:57,907 --> 00:12:00,947
They all have the same thing in mind.

316
00:12:01,677 --> 00:12:04,047
You can even switch So Min's brain with Kwang Soo's.

317
00:12:04,047 --> 00:12:05,477
They think the same.

318
00:12:06,107 --> 00:12:07,477
(They refuse to make strategies.)

319
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:12,577
(These moths are attracted to a large amount of money.)

320
00:12:13,577 --> 00:12:15,547
They're all coming to exit eight. What should I do?

321
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:19,977
But I'm not going to exit eight actually.

322
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:25,107
It's highly likely that So Min will not go to exit eight.

323
00:12:25,107 --> 00:12:26,807
I'm almost there.

324
00:12:26,907 --> 00:12:29,877
I'll choose among exits 2, 3, or 4. I plan to take just 50 dollars.

325
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:30,907
I think that's the best choice.

326
00:12:31,077 --> 00:12:33,007
Then go to exit 5. I'll go to exit 6.

327
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:35,677
- Hey. - Do you want to go down together?

328
00:12:35,677 --> 00:12:36,977
Let's meet up then.

329
00:12:36,977 --> 00:12:38,147
Great.

330
00:12:38,277 --> 00:12:39,577
Is exit one far from here?

331
00:12:40,307 --> 00:12:42,007
Most of them will choose among exits 5, 6, and 7.

332
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:43,007
(Instead of exit 8)

333
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:45,247
I think it'll be crazy around those exits.

334
00:12:45,977 --> 00:12:48,247
Come if you'd like. Let's all go down together.

335
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:50,077
I'm possessed now.

336
00:12:50,107 --> 00:12:52,647
Only ghosts can take down dumb heads, and that's me.

337
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:54,807
They won't come to this exit, will they?

338
00:12:54,877 --> 00:12:56,907
Will there be two people at the exit? I hope not.

339
00:12:57,147 --> 00:12:59,077
We only have 2... No, 1 minute left now.

340
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:01,807
- Did you decide? - Yes, I did.

341
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:02,877
I have no regrets.

342
00:13:02,877 --> 00:13:04,177
(Haha arrives somewhere.)

343
00:13:04,177 --> 00:13:05,907
It's driving me crazy.

344
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:09,247
(Haha is so nervous because he arrived at exit 8.)

345
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,407
I'll get off.

346
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:13,547
(He's nervous that there might be someone else here.)

347
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:14,947
I'll go and stand there.

348
00:13:16,147 --> 00:13:18,107
(A cameraman is installing something.)

349
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:26,007
(So Min's here.)

350
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:27,307
It's Haha!

351
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:29,807
- Haha. - Don't get off.

352
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:33,277
- Goodness. - Is this real?

353
00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:34,747
Are we seriously doing this?

354
00:13:35,777 --> 00:13:38,447
Actually, I'm not interested in choosing exits 2 to 7.

355
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:40,647
I'll go for either exits 1 or 8.

356
00:13:40,647 --> 00:13:43,347
The other members might choose the exits in the middle.

357
00:13:43,347 --> 00:13:46,747
(Psychologically speaking, my choice would be...)

358
00:13:46,747 --> 00:13:48,107
Can you do rock-paper-scissors with me?

359
00:13:48,147 --> 00:13:49,977
If you win, I'll go for exit one. Rock-paper-scissors.

360
00:13:49,977 --> 00:13:51,077
(If So Min wins, she'll go for exit 8.)

361
00:13:51,077 --> 00:13:52,077
(So Min wins.)

362
00:13:52,077 --> 00:13:53,607
I'll choose exit eight.

363
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:54,907
(The result in choosing exit 8)

364
00:13:54,907 --> 00:13:56,007
It's not true, right?

365
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:57,377
It can't be.

366
00:13:57,377 --> 00:13:58,447
Let's go. Where is it?

367
00:13:58,577 --> 00:13:59,777
Is it over there?

368
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,777
So Min, did you choose here for certain?

369
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,907
I chose to go for exit eight.

370
00:14:04,347 --> 00:14:05,777
(He overestimated her.)

371
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:07,477
Gosh, seriously...

372
00:14:08,777 --> 00:14:09,947
What should I do?

373
00:14:09,947 --> 00:14:11,947
We already need to divide by 2.

374
00:14:12,107 --> 00:14:13,677
Gosh, it's tiring.

375
00:14:14,677 --> 00:14:16,677
Tell me. Did you intend on coming here from the start?

376
00:14:16,777 --> 00:14:18,777
- Tell me. - No, I wanted to go to exit one.

377
00:14:19,147 --> 00:14:21,677
It was exit one in the beginning, and you all said you'd come to...

378
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:22,777
Someone's here.

379
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:24,707
We're in trouble.

380
00:14:24,707 --> 00:14:26,477
(Is someone here again?)

381
00:14:27,207 --> 00:14:28,247
Who is that?

382
00:14:28,377 --> 00:14:29,777
Someone's here again.

383
00:14:29,947 --> 00:14:31,547
What should we do?

384
00:14:31,877 --> 00:14:33,777
- Is it Jae Seok? - It's Seok Jin.

385
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:36,707
Seok Jin! Why did you come here?

386
00:14:36,707 --> 00:14:37,777
(Seok Jin has joined.)

387
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:40,007
- Hey, Speed. - Power, what happened?

388
00:14:41,477 --> 00:14:42,907
(They aren't glad to see each other at all.)

389
00:14:42,977 --> 00:14:44,277
I thought you were going to exit one.

390
00:14:44,277 --> 00:14:45,907
I was going to,

391
00:14:45,907 --> 00:14:48,547
but you all said you'd come to exit eight, so I figured you wouldn't.

392
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:51,677
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

393
00:14:51,677 --> 00:14:53,047
- Hey. - I'm done for.

394
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:54,877
It's all right. It's still 33 dollars each.

395
00:14:56,077 --> 00:14:58,107
They won't come, so don't worry.

396
00:14:58,547 --> 00:15:00,047
I should've gone to exit one.

397
00:15:00,347 --> 00:15:01,807
Gosh, this is crazy.

398
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:05,007
(While these doubtful members are gathered at exit 8...)

399
00:15:05,347 --> 00:15:06,577
It seems like no one's here.

400
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:09,347
I don't think there's anyone there.

401
00:15:09,347 --> 00:15:10,877
(Jae Seok goes somewhere secretly.)

402
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,177
Is this it?

403
00:15:12,507 --> 00:15:13,847
Thank you.

404
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:15,347
Is anyone here?

405
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,377
(There seems to be no one.)

406
00:15:18,677 --> 00:15:19,977
Hello.

407
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:22,847
(He finally slips away from the moths.)

408
00:15:25,977 --> 00:15:27,307
My goodness.

409
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:28,447
It's you, Jae Seok.

410
00:15:29,007 --> 00:15:31,107
Why did you come here?

411
00:15:31,747 --> 00:15:33,507
Gosh, it's Seok Jin.

412
00:15:33,507 --> 00:15:35,477
How annoying.

413
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:36,647
Jae Seok is here.

414
00:15:36,847 --> 00:15:38,077
- No. - Did you come here?

415
00:15:38,077 --> 00:15:39,477
He came to exit eight.

416
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,247
We'll only get 25 dollars each.

417
00:15:42,247 --> 00:15:43,347
(He calculates.)

418
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:46,007
It's time to choose. Which exit will it be?

419
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,277
I choose exit eight.

420
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:52,307
After telling people on the phone that I choose exit eight,

421
00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:54,547
I thought about changing my mind.

422
00:15:54,547 --> 00:15:56,347
I think people will go to exits 5, 6, and 7.

423
00:15:57,307 --> 00:15:58,647
Why did you come here?

424
00:15:58,647 --> 00:16:01,407
- I didn't think you would. - I didn't think it'd be this many.

425
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:04,947
How did you come here? The maximum should be 2 or 3.

426
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:05,947
(Where are the others?)

427
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:09,047
I understand this game perfectly.

428
00:16:10,247 --> 00:16:11,647
The mentality of the members...

429
00:16:12,547 --> 00:16:14,877
and their habits that I've observed so far...

430
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:17,847
Instead of being a moth,

431
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:21,377
I'm clever like Jeong Yak Yong.

432
00:16:22,007 --> 00:16:23,177
I'm clever like Jeong Yak Yong.

433
00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:24,607
(He has a misunderstanding.)

434
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:25,707
Take a look.

435
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:30,777
I'm worried that someone else will come for 50 dollars.

436
00:16:31,477 --> 00:16:33,077
I'll choose among exits 5, 6, and 7.

437
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:34,147
(Will she get greedy or stay safe?)

438
00:16:34,147 --> 00:16:36,747
- Really? - These are three numbers.

439
00:16:36,947 --> 00:16:39,907
I want to be arrogant and go to exit one.

440
00:16:41,277 --> 00:16:44,107
I'll go to exit one like an arrogant person.

441
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:46,577
I want to get 40 dollars and live a normal life.

442
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,247
(Here's the arrogant man.)

443
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:50,677
I'm clever like Jeong Yak Yong.

444
00:16:51,447 --> 00:16:54,307
(Like Jeong Yak Yong, Kwang Soo chooses exit one.)

445
00:16:54,607 --> 00:16:56,447
This is also possible.

446
00:16:56,977 --> 00:16:59,577
Many members could gather at 1 of the 70-dollar exits.

447
00:16:59,577 --> 00:17:00,847
- I hope they're doomed. - That's possible.

448
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:04,877
- Look. - What?

449
00:17:04,877 --> 00:17:05,877
Did someone else come?

450
00:17:05,877 --> 00:17:07,947
- Don't come here. - Is that Se Chan?

451
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:11,577
(They didn't expect someone else would come.)

452
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:14,377
(Se Chan, the youngest moth, arrives.)

453
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:15,907
Se Chan.

454
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:17,907
- Is this a meeting place? - No.

455
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:20,447
- Why did you come here? - Hey, moths.

456
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:21,547
- Leave. - Leave.

457
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:24,177
- All the moths... - Leave.

458
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,777
- are here. - You should leave.

459
00:17:25,777 --> 00:17:27,147
This is incredible.

460
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:28,847
I didn't expect the five of us.

461
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:31,047
Do we get 20 dollars each?

462
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:33,277
This is the worst.

463
00:17:33,277 --> 00:17:35,507
This is exactly what I predicted.

464
00:17:35,507 --> 00:17:37,947
It's because you came here.

465
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:40,117
- Why did you come? - Just wait and see.

466
00:17:40,117 --> 00:17:42,807
I came here to catch you.

467
00:17:44,617 --> 00:17:46,907
What about you? Why did you come here?

468
00:17:46,907 --> 00:17:48,877
I didn't expect you and Se Chan to be here.

469
00:17:48,877 --> 00:17:50,117
There's no one else.

470
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:51,747
Really? Okay.

471
00:17:51,747 --> 00:17:52,747
(Jong Kook gets 50 dollars.)

472
00:17:53,147 --> 00:17:56,677
Really? This is really amazing.

473
00:17:56,677 --> 00:17:58,677
(Ji Hyo gets 70, Jong Kook gets 50, and Kwang Soo gets 40 dollars.)

474
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,117
(The rest gets 20 dollars each.)

475
00:18:00,877 --> 00:18:02,177
It feels cool here.

476
00:18:02,877 --> 00:18:04,117
It's very nice.

477
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,047
You can come here directly from the street.

478
00:18:06,677 --> 00:18:07,777
I've never been here.

479
00:18:07,777 --> 00:18:09,147
It used to be an overpass.

480
00:18:09,147 --> 00:18:11,677
- It was Seoul Station. - Seoul Station?

481
00:18:12,177 --> 00:18:14,077
- People used to... - It's nice here.

482
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:16,177
Walk over the road.

483
00:18:16,377 --> 00:18:18,677
- Look at the trees. - It's in the middle of the city.

484
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:21,547
(Which mission awaits them at Seoul Overpass Park?)

485
00:18:21,677 --> 00:18:24,447
Now that you're all here, here's the status of mission fees.

486
00:18:24,677 --> 00:18:26,077
Jae Seok, Seok Jin,

487
00:18:26,077 --> 00:18:28,377
Haha, Se Chan, and So Min.

488
00:18:28,377 --> 00:18:30,977
All of you were at exit 8, so you get 20 dollars each.

489
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,807
How did all of you choose exit eight?

490
00:18:33,807 --> 00:18:37,577
I thought everyone would think.

491
00:18:37,907 --> 00:18:39,377
(What did he say?)

492
00:18:39,377 --> 00:18:40,977
I thought you'd go to exits 5, 6, or 7.

493
00:18:40,977 --> 00:18:42,407
Did you hear that?

494
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:46,307
It's because he won 50 dollars.

495
00:18:46,307 --> 00:18:47,747
You were too greedy.

496
00:18:47,747 --> 00:18:51,377
Who's more annoying than Jong Kook is Kwang Soo.

497
00:18:51,377 --> 00:18:53,077
- Jae Seok. - How could you?

498
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:54,747
I wasn't being a coward.

499
00:18:54,747 --> 00:18:57,677
I was only being clever. I wasn't being a coward.

500
00:18:57,677 --> 00:18:59,807
What if people gathered at that exit?

501
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:01,507
I thought about exit one.

502
00:19:01,677 --> 00:19:05,877
There's less than one percent chance of winning.

503
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:08,577
It's called Discordance Race.

504
00:19:08,877 --> 00:19:10,577
(What is Discordance Race?)

505
00:19:10,577 --> 00:19:12,117
- What is it? - Discordance Race?

506
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:16,177
If there's discordance among all the members during the mission,

507
00:19:16,277 --> 00:19:18,177
- the race is over immediately. - Really?

508
00:19:18,177 --> 00:19:20,877
- The race is over immediately. - Discordance?

509
00:19:20,877 --> 00:19:22,747
Is it discordance among all of us?

510
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:25,307
- It's discordance among all. - If we went to different exits...

511
00:19:25,307 --> 00:19:27,977
The shoot would be over if we went to different exits.

512
00:19:27,977 --> 00:19:30,147
I just said that. Why are you repeating?

513
00:19:30,477 --> 00:19:32,207
He wants to be heard.

514
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:34,347
You don't know which one the producer will use.

515
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:35,377
We don't know.

516
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:36,577
I already said it.

517
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:38,847
- He said it. - You've been talking a lot so far.

518
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,747
He might use mine.

519
00:19:40,877 --> 00:19:45,177
You've been on the show for eight years.

520
00:19:45,177 --> 00:19:47,777
- You know he won't use your part. - He sometimes does.

521
00:19:47,777 --> 00:19:48,947
(It's sometimes.)

522
00:19:49,377 --> 00:19:50,807
- Sometimes? - He can't...

523
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:52,947
let go of his hope.

524
00:19:52,947 --> 00:19:54,077
Seok Jin continues.

525
00:19:54,077 --> 00:19:57,407
Is the race over once everyone is in discordance?

526
00:19:57,407 --> 00:19:59,477
(She interrupts.)

527
00:19:59,477 --> 00:20:01,347
- Stop it. - Stay quiet.

528
00:20:01,347 --> 00:20:03,047
Your part won't be aired.

529
00:20:03,047 --> 00:20:04,877
Stay quiet. Your part won't be aired.

530
00:20:04,877 --> 00:20:06,407
(Everyone wants to steal the show.)

531
00:20:06,407 --> 00:20:08,547
This is what Seok Jin always says.

532
00:20:08,547 --> 00:20:10,177
Okay, okay.

533
00:20:10,847 --> 00:20:12,207
Is that it?

534
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,507
My line is, "Okay, let's go."

535
00:20:16,177 --> 00:20:18,477
(He cried 8 years for that 1 line.)

536
00:20:18,477 --> 00:20:19,947
That's my one line.

537
00:20:19,947 --> 00:20:21,347
The part when he summarizes is always aired.

538
00:20:21,347 --> 00:20:23,307
It's never aired when he scolds people.

539
00:20:23,617 --> 00:20:25,117
The part when he scolds others.

540
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:28,377
The race will be over when everyone is in discordance.

541
00:20:28,377 --> 00:20:29,447
- Okay. - Is that clear?

542
00:20:29,447 --> 00:20:30,947
In other cases,

543
00:20:31,077 --> 00:20:34,707
the members in accordance will receive Accordance Badges.

544
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:38,047
If there's any member who collects 10 Accordance Badges,

545
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:39,507
the race will be over.

546
00:20:39,707 --> 00:20:41,707
If there's any member, the race will be over.

547
00:20:42,547 --> 00:20:44,407
Everyone being in discordance will be hard.

548
00:20:44,407 --> 00:20:47,447
Let's aim for collecting 10 Accordance Badges.

549
00:20:47,677 --> 00:20:48,777
- Let's do that. - They should be 10.

550
00:20:48,777 --> 00:20:50,507
- Let's go for 10 Accordance Badges. - Okay.

551
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:51,947
That's a good idea.

552
00:20:51,947 --> 00:20:53,807
Accordance Badge.

553
00:20:53,807 --> 00:20:55,007
This is great.

554
00:20:55,007 --> 00:20:56,577
Collecting Accordance Badges is easy.

555
00:20:56,577 --> 00:20:58,007
(They're excited for the race.)

556
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:02,347
Those who receive an Accordance Badge must pay a total of...

557
00:21:02,347 --> 00:21:05,847
one dollar multiplied by the number of members in accordance.

558
00:21:06,117 --> 00:21:08,877
- I see. - We have to pay.

559
00:21:08,877 --> 00:21:10,617
Everything costs money.

560
00:21:11,277 --> 00:21:13,147
When the race is over,

561
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:16,377
the member who has the most mission fee places first.

562
00:21:17,347 --> 00:21:19,547
- That's important. - Will that person throw the dice?

563
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:21,447
Yes. The winner has...

564
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:25,617
the right to choose one member to be exempted from being penalized.

565
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,907
- One member? - Yes.

566
00:21:26,907 --> 00:21:28,907
(The winner can free another member.)

567
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,907
(They must keep as much mission fee as possible until the end.)

568
00:21:34,177 --> 00:21:37,777
(The winner throws the dice and attaches I Go Stickers to someone.)

569
00:21:37,777 --> 00:21:40,247
(Who will win, and who will receive the Sticker?)

570
00:21:40,247 --> 00:21:42,617
Here's your first mission.

571
00:21:43,207 --> 00:21:46,117
It's called Where Is Your Hometown?

572
00:21:46,117 --> 00:21:49,307
(The first mission is Where Is Your Hometown?)

573
00:21:49,647 --> 00:21:53,107
You'll go and choose one of the staff members.

574
00:21:53,407 --> 00:21:56,377
If their hometown is in discordance, the mission is cleared.

575
00:21:56,377 --> 00:21:59,847
The hometown will be limited to 14 provinces.

576
00:22:00,507 --> 00:22:02,677
The sound director isn't here.

577
00:22:02,677 --> 00:22:05,347
(Let's find people from different hometowns.)

578
00:22:05,877 --> 00:22:09,447
Director Kim seems like he's from Jeju Island.

579
00:22:12,277 --> 00:22:13,477
Come here, Young Jin.

580
00:22:13,477 --> 00:22:14,807
Haha.

581
00:22:14,807 --> 00:22:15,807
Young Jin.

582
00:22:15,807 --> 00:22:17,707
- The manager is from Busan. - He's from Incheon.

583
00:22:18,007 --> 00:22:20,077
Someone else might be from Incheon.

584
00:22:20,077 --> 00:22:22,777
There may not be many people...

585
00:22:22,977 --> 00:22:24,907
who are from Seoul.

586
00:22:24,907 --> 00:22:26,547
- Where are you from? - Seoul.

587
00:22:26,907 --> 00:22:29,107
- Are you really? - Yes.

588
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:30,377
Kwon Ryeol.

589
00:22:31,047 --> 00:22:32,777
(Jong Kook chooses Kwon Ryeol.)

590
00:22:32,777 --> 00:22:33,847
Let's go, Kwon Ryeol.

591
00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:35,707
- Where is your hometown? - Me?

592
00:22:35,707 --> 00:22:36,947
I'm from Gangnam, Seoul.

593
00:22:36,947 --> 00:22:38,407
- Stop joking. - Really.

594
00:22:38,407 --> 00:22:40,777
You're lying. You aren't from Gangnam.

595
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,207
I know you're lying.

596
00:22:42,207 --> 00:22:43,307
It's true.

597
00:22:44,507 --> 00:22:45,607
Hyo Jung.

598
00:22:46,247 --> 00:22:49,177
Hyo Jung, come here.

599
00:22:49,907 --> 00:22:52,847
You look preppy today.

600
00:22:53,677 --> 00:22:55,007
Has everyone chosen?

601
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,077
Seok Jin isn't ready.

602
00:22:56,077 --> 00:22:58,407
- Is it only me who hasn't chosen? - Yes.

603
00:22:58,407 --> 00:23:00,007
I can't decide.

604
00:23:01,077 --> 00:23:02,507
Hurry up, Seok Jin.

605
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:03,947
Just choose someone.

606
00:23:03,947 --> 00:23:05,107
Wait.

607
00:23:06,307 --> 00:23:07,477
Where's your hometown?

608
00:23:08,147 --> 00:23:09,177
Where's your hometown?

609
00:23:09,177 --> 00:23:10,647
(He approaches the sound director.)

610
00:23:10,647 --> 00:23:12,777
- How about the sound director? - Please come.

611
00:23:13,377 --> 00:23:15,947
It's because he looks interesting.

612
00:23:15,947 --> 00:23:17,077
Come with us.

613
00:23:17,077 --> 00:23:18,577
Bring the equipment.

614
00:23:18,577 --> 00:23:21,207
- It's like a base station. - Let's go.

615
00:23:21,707 --> 00:23:23,377
He carries a base station.

616
00:23:23,647 --> 00:23:25,207
- Be careful. - You're right.

617
00:23:25,207 --> 00:23:26,807
He makes it look interesting.

618
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:28,947
- But... - It's a base station.

619
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:30,677
The connection should be good.

620
00:23:30,947 --> 00:23:32,477
Use wireless internet.

621
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:35,647
(Use data as much as you want.)

622
00:23:36,307 --> 00:23:38,007
- Everyone. - We feel supported.

623
00:23:38,007 --> 00:23:39,477
Each of you brought a staff member.

624
00:23:39,477 --> 00:23:40,977
Let's check...

625
00:23:40,977 --> 00:23:44,347
the result of Where Is Your Hometown?

626
00:23:44,847 --> 00:23:46,107
Let's start with the left.

627
00:23:46,107 --> 00:23:49,347
Here's the hometown of the staff whom Ji Hyo chose.

628
00:23:49,347 --> 00:23:51,507
- She's our main writer. - Yes, she is.

629
00:23:51,507 --> 00:23:52,977
It's Kim Mi Yeon.

630
00:23:54,007 --> 00:23:55,747
(It's time to announce their hometowns.)

631
00:23:56,847 --> 00:23:58,547
He still has to work.

632
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:01,577
(He stays focused on work.)

633
00:24:01,577 --> 00:24:04,577
- You're getting close. - He has too much work to do.

634
00:24:05,147 --> 00:24:06,507
He has a lot of work.

635
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:08,577
- He's amazing. - He has to work.

636
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:10,007
He's amazing.

637
00:24:10,007 --> 00:24:12,507
- He's a real professional. - I'm sorry.

638
00:24:12,847 --> 00:24:14,377
He's a professional.

639
00:24:14,807 --> 00:24:16,377
He looks great.

640
00:24:16,377 --> 00:24:17,407
(He won't miss a thing.)

641
00:24:17,577 --> 00:24:20,207
Where's your hometown?

642
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:21,477
I'm from...

643
00:24:21,477 --> 00:24:27,207
(My hometown is...)

644
00:24:28,147 --> 00:24:30,477
I'm from Gochang, Jeollabuk-do.

645
00:24:30,477 --> 00:24:31,977
- Jeollabuk-do? - I told you.

646
00:24:31,977 --> 00:24:33,277
That's good.

647
00:24:33,277 --> 00:24:35,007
- It's good. - Isn't Jeollabuk-do rare?

648
00:24:35,577 --> 00:24:37,707
By the way, I worked with Mi Yeon...

649
00:24:37,707 --> 00:24:40,007
when I did Plate Karaoke on "Happy Together".

650
00:24:41,407 --> 00:24:42,777
- What are you doing? - She was the youngest writer.

651
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:45,807
- She was the youngest writer. - What are you doing?

652
00:24:45,807 --> 00:24:47,907
- He's busy working. - Sir.

653
00:24:48,207 --> 00:24:49,907
Let him rest for a while.

654
00:24:50,377 --> 00:24:51,477
We'll record.

655
00:24:51,477 --> 00:24:52,677
We'll record.

656
00:24:52,677 --> 00:24:54,247
Isn't it the limbo game?

657
00:24:55,347 --> 00:24:57,507
(Everything is good with one boom microphone.)

658
00:24:57,507 --> 00:24:59,507
You can leave it.

659
00:24:59,507 --> 00:25:00,847
I'll do it.

660
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:03,677
As I said, she was the youngest writer back then.

661
00:25:03,677 --> 00:25:04,677
Now, she's the main writer.

662
00:25:04,677 --> 00:25:06,077
- Really? - Yes.

663
00:25:06,677 --> 00:25:09,077
(The staff member Ji Hyo chose is from Jeolla-do.)

664
00:25:09,477 --> 00:25:12,177
- Next, Song Hwa. - Our youngest writer.

665
00:25:12,307 --> 00:25:14,777
How long have you been working for Running Man?

666
00:25:14,777 --> 00:25:16,177
- Five months. - Was it her?

667
00:25:16,177 --> 00:25:17,877
- Five months. - How has it been?

668
00:25:17,877 --> 00:25:20,047
Do you like the working environment?

669
00:25:20,107 --> 00:25:21,107
Yes, of course.

670
00:25:21,107 --> 00:25:22,877
Please be honest.

671
00:25:22,877 --> 00:25:24,947
(I love it.)

672
00:25:24,947 --> 00:25:26,747
- It's true. - Are you planning to transfer?

673
00:25:26,847 --> 00:25:27,977
No.

674
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:29,247
Song Hwa works hard.

675
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:30,647
(Song Hwa, that was a nice answer.)

676
00:25:30,977 --> 00:25:32,207
Where do you come from?

677
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:33,207
I come from...

678
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:38,147
(Where is the youngest writer from?)

679
00:25:38,377 --> 00:25:39,807
I come from Daejeon.

680
00:25:39,877 --> 00:25:42,277
- Good. - I come from Daejeon.

681
00:25:42,277 --> 00:25:43,407
(The two answers so far are different.)

682
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:44,607
- Good. - Success.

683
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,107
- Nice. - This is not easy.

684
00:25:46,107 --> 00:25:47,407
- The answers were different. - It might be possible.

685
00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:48,777
- We might succeed. - They might be all different.

686
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:50,947
Who are you in charge of filming?

687
00:25:50,947 --> 00:25:52,907
- After Gary left, - Se Chan.

688
00:25:53,047 --> 00:25:55,407
- he shot only ants for two months. - Actually...

689
00:25:55,407 --> 00:25:57,477
(After Gary left, he shot only ants for two months.)

690
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:01,277
(Since Gary left, )

691
00:26:01,277 --> 00:26:04,947
(I've had no one to shoot.)

692
00:26:05,277 --> 00:26:06,277
Hey.

693
00:26:07,147 --> 00:26:08,647
Just shoot things like those.

694
00:26:09,147 --> 00:26:12,947
(He had to shoot ants instead of Gary.)

695
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:15,747
(Se Chan, thank you for giving me something to do.)

696
00:26:16,177 --> 00:26:17,877
- I see. - All right.

697
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:20,677
We've had Jeolla-do and Daejeon so far.

698
00:26:20,677 --> 00:26:22,677
- Where are you from? - Gyeonggi-do?

699
00:26:22,677 --> 00:26:24,247
(The last two answers have been different.)

700
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:29,647
(Where is the cameraman from?)

701
00:26:29,647 --> 00:26:31,047
Pyeongchang, Gangwon-do.

702
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,747
(Pyeongchang, Gangwon-do)

703
00:26:33,747 --> 00:26:35,207
- Perfect. - We never know.

704
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:36,647
- We might succeed. - We might.

705
00:26:36,647 --> 00:26:38,307
- No one knows. - We might.

706
00:26:41,047 --> 00:26:44,277
(It's as miraculous as that day.)

707
00:26:45,507 --> 00:26:47,877
(Discordance Mission)

708
00:26:47,877 --> 00:26:52,577
(We can do this.)

709
00:26:53,677 --> 00:26:55,277
So Min, we can do this.

710
00:26:55,277 --> 00:26:56,977
Unbelievably,

711
00:26:56,977 --> 00:26:58,777
we just picked random people.

712
00:26:59,277 --> 00:27:01,047
- Kwon Ryeol came late today. - Really?

713
00:27:01,047 --> 00:27:03,007
I know. That's why he's shooting me.

714
00:27:03,007 --> 00:27:05,207
- I see. - He came to the wrong address.

715
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,477
I'd love to know why you were late.

716
00:27:07,477 --> 00:27:09,177
I woke up late.

717
00:27:09,177 --> 00:27:12,147
According to someone on the social media,

718
00:27:12,147 --> 00:27:13,247
you had a party last night.

719
00:27:13,307 --> 00:27:14,947
He had a party?

720
00:27:14,947 --> 00:27:16,107
He did?

721
00:27:16,107 --> 00:27:18,107
When you have a shooting the next day, please don't...

722
00:27:18,107 --> 00:27:19,347
- It applies to us too. - What party?

723
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:20,707
What kind of party was it?

724
00:27:21,247 --> 00:27:22,507
It's my wife's birthday next week,

725
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,077
and I'll be away shooting that day.

726
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:25,507
- So you celebrated early? - Yes.

727
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,207
That's romantic.

728
00:27:27,207 --> 00:27:28,247
(He always celebrates his wife's birthday with her.)

729
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:30,777
What did you do?

730
00:27:31,377 --> 00:27:34,777
We had meat at a restaurant.

731
00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:36,277
Isn't that what you like?

732
00:27:36,677 --> 00:27:37,677
You eat out all the time.

733
00:27:37,677 --> 00:27:40,177
Wasn't it for your sake?

734
00:27:40,177 --> 00:27:42,347
I know where Kwon Ryeol comes from.

735
00:27:42,347 --> 00:27:43,677
Where do you come from?

736
00:27:43,677 --> 00:27:45,207
(It has to be a different answer for the 4th time.)

737
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:51,577
(Where is the romantic husband, Kwon Ryeol, from?)

738
00:27:51,577 --> 00:27:53,347
- I'm from Seoul. - Nice.

739
00:27:53,347 --> 00:27:55,047
(Seoul)

740
00:27:55,047 --> 00:27:56,247
- Hwagok-dong. - Is he from Seoul?

741
00:27:56,247 --> 00:27:58,477
- Really? - This is unbelievable.

742
00:27:58,477 --> 00:27:59,477
Are you from Seoul?

743
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:01,277
You said we could go home.

744
00:28:01,277 --> 00:28:03,107
- We have three people left. - This is going well.

745
00:28:03,377 --> 00:28:04,947
This is unbelievable.

746
00:28:04,947 --> 00:28:07,507
We have three people left.

747
00:28:08,177 --> 00:28:10,347
This microphone belongs to this man.

748
00:28:10,777 --> 00:28:12,447
The moving base station.

749
00:28:12,477 --> 00:28:16,277
While you listen, some members can scream or something.

750
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,277
- Yes. - It must be...

751
00:28:17,277 --> 00:28:20,177
It'd be great if you don't scream.

752
00:28:20,177 --> 00:28:21,377
Whom are you talking about?

753
00:28:21,377 --> 00:28:23,747
Kwang Soo.

754
00:28:24,307 --> 00:28:25,677
He swears too often.

755
00:28:25,677 --> 00:28:26,677
I swear?

756
00:28:26,677 --> 00:28:28,377
- I swear? - Yes.

757
00:28:28,577 --> 00:28:30,747
(Like this?)

758
00:28:31,007 --> 00:28:32,507
I'm sorry.

759
00:28:32,507 --> 00:28:33,877
- I'm sorry. - See?

760
00:28:33,877 --> 00:28:35,677
I apologize.

761
00:28:35,677 --> 00:28:36,677
He's...

762
00:28:36,677 --> 00:28:37,877
He hears it right away.

763
00:28:37,877 --> 00:28:39,677
- I'm sorry. - He hears it right away.

764
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,207
I'm sorry. I was joking.

765
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:43,277
It's different from how we hear it.

766
00:28:43,577 --> 00:28:44,877
He hears it directly.

767
00:28:44,877 --> 00:28:47,577
All right. I'd like to ask you where you come from.

768
00:28:47,577 --> 00:28:49,647
Please. Gyeongsang-do would be great.

769
00:28:49,647 --> 00:28:50,647
That hasn't come out yet, right?

770
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:52,247
- No Gyeonggi-do either. - Where are you from?

771
00:28:52,247 --> 00:28:53,247
I'm...

772
00:28:53,247 --> 00:29:01,047
(Where is this base-station guy from?)

773
00:29:01,047 --> 00:29:02,047
I'm from Seoul.

774
00:29:02,047 --> 00:29:04,107
(Seoul again)

775
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:08,477
(Disappointing)

776
00:29:08,477 --> 00:29:09,577
Is this it?

777
00:29:09,577 --> 00:29:12,147
Wait. Think carefully.

778
00:29:12,147 --> 00:29:13,347
Not where you live right now.

779
00:29:13,577 --> 00:29:14,777
Not where you live.

780
00:29:14,777 --> 00:29:15,777
Where were you born?

781
00:29:15,777 --> 00:29:17,107
You might have been in Gyeonggi-do.

782
00:29:17,107 --> 00:29:18,607
- Siheung, for example. - Where were you born?

783
00:29:18,647 --> 00:29:20,407
Which island are you from?

784
00:29:20,407 --> 00:29:22,077
I'm from Seoul...

785
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,677
(Hitting)

786
00:29:23,677 --> 00:29:27,577
(I don't want to hear it.)

787
00:29:28,577 --> 00:29:30,077
Where in Seoul?

788
00:29:30,077 --> 00:29:31,147
Think carefully.

789
00:29:31,147 --> 00:29:32,647
Did your phone number start with 02?

790
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:34,407
(Discordance Mission has failed.)

791
00:29:34,407 --> 00:29:35,647
Wait.

792
00:29:35,647 --> 00:29:37,547
- Hyo Jung... - Where are you from?

793
00:29:37,677 --> 00:29:39,807
I'm from Yongsan-Gu, Seoul.

794
00:29:39,977 --> 00:29:42,377
Haha's fashion mentor.

795
00:29:42,377 --> 00:29:43,377
Where are you from?

796
00:29:43,377 --> 00:29:44,747
I'm from Itaewon, Seoul.

797
00:29:44,777 --> 00:29:46,407
- Jong Kook's... - Jong Kook's stylist.

798
00:29:46,407 --> 00:29:47,577
Yes, she's his stylist.

799
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,877
Where are you from, Ji Sun?

800
00:29:48,877 --> 00:29:49,947
I'm from Ganghwa Island.

801
00:29:49,947 --> 00:29:50,947
Ganghwa Island.

802
00:29:51,507 --> 00:29:55,077
When do you feel most rewarded while working for Jong Kook?

803
00:29:56,507 --> 00:29:58,207
When was it the hardest?

804
00:29:58,207 --> 00:30:00,647
Every day.

805
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:02,407
(It's challenging every day.)

806
00:30:02,407 --> 00:30:04,047
Well...

807
00:30:04,047 --> 00:30:05,977
(The interview ends abruptly.)

808
00:30:07,177 --> 00:30:09,477
(This is the end of Where Is Your Hometown?)

809
00:30:09,777 --> 00:30:11,007
All right.

810
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:12,677
You've failed the mission.

811
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:13,677
- Yes. - Yes.

812
00:30:14,007 --> 00:30:16,777
Four of the answers were the same.

813
00:30:16,777 --> 00:30:18,047
- Gosh. - Yes.

814
00:30:18,047 --> 00:30:20,047
- Jong Kook, Seok Jin, - That's right.

815
00:30:20,047 --> 00:30:21,677
Jae Seok, and Haha.

816
00:30:21,677 --> 00:30:23,677
You have to pay a fine of four dollars.

817
00:30:23,677 --> 00:30:25,777
- Again? - Please.

818
00:30:25,777 --> 00:30:28,277
I have only 20 dollars. I can't give you 4 dollars.

819
00:30:28,277 --> 00:30:30,247
- Excuse me. - You'll also get...

820
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:31,407
four Accordance Badges each.

821
00:30:31,407 --> 00:30:32,407
- What? - Wait.

822
00:30:32,407 --> 00:30:36,177
(They'll get 4 Accordance Badges each.)

823
00:30:36,677 --> 00:30:38,007
- 4? - Isn't 10 the maximum?

824
00:30:38,007 --> 00:30:39,347
- Yes. - Right?

825
00:30:39,747 --> 00:30:40,777
Four each?

826
00:30:40,777 --> 00:30:42,477
(When you have received 10 badges, the game will be over.)

827
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,047
Right?

828
00:30:44,207 --> 00:30:46,477
- It's great. - Lend me four dollars.

829
00:30:46,877 --> 00:30:49,477
You have to pay what you have to pay.

830
00:30:49,477 --> 00:30:50,947
Just four dollars.

831
00:30:51,207 --> 00:30:52,247
Please.

832
00:30:52,247 --> 00:30:53,677
Give it to me.

833
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:54,677
Can I get one dollar off?

834
00:30:54,677 --> 00:30:56,077
Come on.

835
00:30:56,377 --> 00:30:57,377
I have only 20 dollars.

836
00:30:57,377 --> 00:30:58,947
Take him away. He's asking for a discount.

837
00:30:58,947 --> 00:31:01,007
Stop it.

838
00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:02,077
What are you doing?

839
00:31:02,077 --> 00:31:04,207
What are you doing? It's over.

840
00:31:04,207 --> 00:31:05,207
- You look pathetic. - Pathetic?

841
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:06,207
- Yes. - Am I pathetic?

842
00:31:06,207 --> 00:31:07,577
Yes, you are.

843
00:31:07,577 --> 00:31:08,877
You guys...

844
00:31:08,877 --> 00:31:10,007
You're unbelievable.

845
00:31:10,007 --> 00:31:12,277
You should have chosen the right one.

846
00:31:13,077 --> 00:31:16,347
(Ji Hyo: 70 dollars, Jong Kook: 46 dollars)

847
00:31:17,477 --> 00:31:18,577
The next mission is...

848
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:22,007
Who Will You Eliminate?

849
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:23,047
- What? - What?

850
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,377
(Who Will You Eliminate?)

851
00:31:26,377 --> 00:31:28,047
You'll move to a place...

852
00:31:28,647 --> 00:31:32,107
and write down the name of the person you'll eliminate.

853
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:34,647
Think carefully on the way.

854
00:31:34,647 --> 00:31:36,577
If two or more people write the same name...

855
00:31:36,577 --> 00:31:38,007
Then you're out.

856
00:31:38,007 --> 00:31:39,177
(They all have to write different names.)

857
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:41,007
- My goodness. - This is hard.

858
00:31:41,007 --> 00:31:42,507
If no one else wrote the same name as you,

859
00:31:42,507 --> 00:31:44,377
you don't have to remove the name tag.

860
00:31:44,377 --> 00:31:45,507
(If no one else wrote the same name, you won't get a Badge.)

861
00:31:45,507 --> 00:31:48,577
If someone wrote the same name, you have to remove the name tag.

862
00:31:48,577 --> 00:31:50,677
You have to think.

863
00:31:50,677 --> 00:31:51,677
- All right. - We have 20 dollars.

864
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:54,377
Let's move to the place.

865
00:31:54,377 --> 00:31:55,677
- All right. - Let's go.

866
00:31:55,677 --> 00:31:57,177
(Whose name would be the safest?)

867
00:31:57,747 --> 00:31:59,777
Don't write our names.

868
00:31:59,777 --> 00:32:01,807
- All right. - Don't write my name.

869
00:32:01,847 --> 00:32:03,247
Let me in.

870
00:32:03,247 --> 00:32:04,577
We can't.

871
00:32:04,577 --> 00:32:06,207
Wait, whose name should I write?

872
00:32:06,807 --> 00:32:07,947
I've made up my mind.

873
00:32:09,207 --> 00:32:11,307
Seok Jin was considering Jong Kook.

874
00:32:11,307 --> 00:32:12,647
(If you make the wrong choice, you'll lose money.)

875
00:32:13,947 --> 00:32:16,147
You have to choose a person you think you can eliminate.

876
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:19,647
Or someone no one else would choose.

877
00:32:19,877 --> 00:32:21,977
(Jong Kook? Kwang Soo? Haha? So Min? Seok Jin? Jae Seok?)

878
00:32:21,977 --> 00:32:25,047
If all names are different, you don't have to remove any name tags.

879
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:27,677
- If they're all different? - Jong Kook would be number eight.

880
00:32:27,677 --> 00:32:30,577
(Jong Kook would be number eight.)

881
00:32:30,947 --> 00:32:33,647
(You want to write my name?)

882
00:32:34,007 --> 00:32:36,847
No one can remove Jong Kook's name tag.

883
00:32:36,847 --> 00:32:38,507
(If two or more people write his name, they have to.)

884
00:32:38,577 --> 00:32:40,677
No one can remove Jong Kook's name tag.

885
00:32:40,677 --> 00:32:42,007
Exactly.

886
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:44,647
(Someone has to write Jong Kook's name.)

887
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:47,977
You don't want to give me Badges.

888
00:32:47,977 --> 00:32:50,477
(Who has the courage to write his name?)

889
00:32:51,207 --> 00:32:53,177
Who would write his name?

890
00:32:53,177 --> 00:32:54,747
(Anxious)

891
00:32:56,877 --> 00:32:58,307
You have to remove the name tag.

892
00:32:58,307 --> 00:33:00,647
I will by all means.

893
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:05,377
Okay, I've made up my mind.

894
00:33:05,377 --> 00:33:07,377
I don't think anyone else wrote this name.

895
00:33:08,177 --> 00:33:12,177
(I won't show anyone what I wrote.)

896
00:33:12,877 --> 00:33:14,507
All right, the result is out.

897
00:33:14,507 --> 00:33:15,507
Okay.

898
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:16,577
Please.

899
00:33:16,877 --> 00:33:19,447
I'll read out the names one by one.

900
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:22,307
You better get ready.

901
00:33:22,307 --> 00:33:23,847
- The game starts right away. - All right.

902
00:33:23,847 --> 00:33:25,147
All right.

903
00:33:25,147 --> 00:33:27,577
You have just five minutes.

904
00:33:28,277 --> 00:33:29,647
Don't do this.

905
00:33:30,307 --> 00:33:31,747
Why are you approaching me?

906
00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:35,107
(Your comrade can turn into an enemy soon.)

907
00:33:36,677 --> 00:33:39,107
(Approaching)

908
00:33:39,107 --> 00:33:40,147
You wrote my name, didn't you?

909
00:33:40,147 --> 00:33:41,777
No, I didn't.

910
00:33:41,777 --> 00:33:43,677
(You couldn't have approached me because you missed me.)

911
00:33:43,677 --> 00:33:45,377
- I didn't write your name. - You did, didn't you?

912
00:33:45,377 --> 00:33:47,277
- I didn't. - I can't trust you.

913
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:49,377
That's not true.

914
00:33:49,377 --> 00:33:53,747
(Did So Min really write Ji Hyo's name?)

915
00:33:54,777 --> 00:33:56,047
As I said before...

916
00:33:56,507 --> 00:33:57,577
I promise you that...

917
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,777
if all names are different, we'll stop shooting right away.

918
00:33:59,777 --> 00:34:01,677
Here we go.

919
00:34:01,677 --> 00:34:03,877
Jae Seok chose...

920
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:06,477
(Jae Seok's choice)

921
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:07,477
Kwang Soo.

922
00:34:07,477 --> 00:34:11,207
(Jae Seok chose Kwang Soo.)

923
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:14,147
Kwang Soo chose...

924
00:34:14,777 --> 00:34:18,107
Se Chan.

925
00:34:18,107 --> 00:34:21,047
(The names are different so far.)

926
00:34:21,047 --> 00:34:22,447
It might be possible.

927
00:34:22,947 --> 00:34:25,677
- It might. - Se Chan chose...

928
00:34:25,677 --> 00:34:28,407
(Se Chan's choice)

929
00:34:28,407 --> 00:34:29,477
Jong Kook.

930
00:34:29,477 --> 00:34:32,517
(Se Chan chose Jong Kook.)

931
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:33,847
(He took a risk.)

932
00:34:33,847 --> 00:34:36,077
- We might succeed. - We might.

933
00:34:36,477 --> 00:34:39,977
(Se Chan had announced that he'd choose Jong Kook.)

934
00:34:40,677 --> 00:34:42,877
I don't think anyone else would choose Jong Kook.

935
00:34:42,877 --> 00:34:45,847
(And he really did.)

936
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:50,377
Discordance!

937
00:34:50,377 --> 00:34:52,177
(It's going well thanks to Se Chan's brave choice.)

938
00:34:52,177 --> 00:34:53,277
Come here.

939
00:34:53,977 --> 00:34:54,977
My goodness.

940
00:34:55,947 --> 00:34:57,677
Jong Kook chose...

941
00:34:57,677 --> 00:35:02,377
(Jong Kook's choice)

942
00:35:02,377 --> 00:35:03,377
Haha.

943
00:35:03,377 --> 00:35:04,977
(Jong Kook chose Haha.)

944
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,307
Wait. Hold on.

945
00:35:08,677 --> 00:35:13,647
(Haha thought no one would write Jong Kook's name.)

946
00:35:13,647 --> 00:35:18,307
(If his strategy is the same with Se Chan's, it means war.)

947
00:35:18,307 --> 00:35:19,547
- Jong Kook wrote Haha's name. - Hey.

948
00:35:20,247 --> 00:35:21,377
Hold on.

949
00:35:21,907 --> 00:35:23,147
- Jong Kook wrote Haha's name. - Hey.

950
00:35:23,147 --> 00:35:25,307
(Hold on. Did you write my name?)

951
00:35:26,247 --> 00:35:27,707
(Moving back slowly)

952
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:32,517
(If Haha wrote Jong Kook's name, he will go to a war with Se Chan.)

953
00:35:32,517 --> 00:35:34,107
The name Haha wrote is...

954
00:35:34,107 --> 00:35:36,307
(If Haha wrote Jong Kook's name, he will go to a war with Se Chan.)

955
00:35:36,407 --> 00:35:37,877
The name Haha wrote is...

956
00:35:38,677 --> 00:35:42,347
(Whose name did Haha write?)

957
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:44,577
(What is Haha's decision?)

958
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:45,707
Jae Seok's.

959
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:47,277
We still have a shot!

960
00:35:47,277 --> 00:35:49,677
(Haha chose Jae Seok whom he thinks he can beat.)

961
00:35:50,647 --> 00:35:51,707
Jae Seok's.

962
00:35:51,707 --> 00:35:55,777
(Success is just around the corner!)

963
00:35:55,777 --> 00:35:58,377
- Hey, this is... - We still have a shot!

964
00:35:58,747 --> 00:35:59,807
We might be successful!

965
00:36:00,307 --> 00:36:01,407
This is amazing.

966
00:36:01,407 --> 00:36:02,707
(Only 3 members remain.)

967
00:36:02,707 --> 00:36:04,547
Ji Hyo doesn't look so good though.

968
00:36:04,547 --> 00:36:07,247
(Ji Hyo doesn't look so good though.)

969
00:36:07,347 --> 00:36:14,017
(The names they wrote can't overlap with each other's.)

970
00:36:14,277 --> 00:36:16,277
The name Ji Hyo wrote down is...

971
00:36:18,647 --> 00:36:20,607
The name Ji Hyo wrote down is...

972
00:36:20,607 --> 00:36:22,707
(Ji Hyo has a sombre look on her face.)

973
00:36:22,707 --> 00:36:24,017
Hey, this might work out!

974
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:28,047
(Whose name did Ji Hyo wrote down?)

975
00:36:28,047 --> 00:36:29,147
It's Seok Jin's.

976
00:36:29,347 --> 00:36:30,517
- What happened? - This is amazing.

977
00:36:30,517 --> 00:36:32,607
(Ji Hyo chose to write Seok Jin's name.)

978
00:36:34,277 --> 00:36:36,477
(A miracle is happening!)

979
00:36:36,477 --> 00:36:38,777
I can't believe this. Could we have really done it?

980
00:36:38,877 --> 00:36:41,247
- So Min and Seok Jin are left. - Wait.

981
00:36:42,877 --> 00:36:47,477
(If Seok Jin and So Min wrote the right names, a war won't occur.)

982
00:36:47,477 --> 00:36:52,517
(A series of miraculous decisions continued.)

983
00:36:52,517 --> 00:36:53,647
- What happened? - This is amazing.

984
00:36:53,947 --> 00:36:55,047
Hey, wait.

985
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,647
(Now, only So Min and Seok Jin remain.)

986
00:36:57,647 --> 00:37:02,017
(Whose names did they write?)

987
00:37:02,017 --> 00:37:03,107
(It's a decisive moment for them!)

988
00:37:03,107 --> 00:37:04,747
The name Seok Jin wrote...

989
00:37:04,977 --> 00:37:07,077
is Ji Hyo and So Min wrote Ji Hyo's name too. Start!

990
00:37:07,077 --> 00:37:11,277
(Seok Jin chose Ji Hyo and so did So Min.)

991
00:37:11,277 --> 00:37:12,807
(The 3-way race starts!)

992
00:37:12,807 --> 00:37:14,647
Goodness, she wrote Ji Hyo's name.

993
00:37:14,647 --> 00:37:15,977
(Ji Hyo must hold out for 5 minutes.)

994
00:37:15,977 --> 00:37:17,207
Why did you write my name?

995
00:37:17,207 --> 00:37:19,477
(If she holds out for 5 minutes, it's a success for her.)

996
00:37:19,477 --> 00:37:23,107
(Seok Jin and So Min must remove her name tag before one another.)

997
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:26,207
(It's a bloody battle in which her name tag is at stake.)

998
00:37:27,807 --> 00:37:29,577
- Wait. What about us? - We are not doing that, are we?

999
00:37:30,017 --> 00:37:31,547
- We don't have to remove the tags. - What about us?

1000
00:37:31,547 --> 00:37:32,977
- We don't have to play it. - We don't have to.

1001
00:37:32,977 --> 00:37:34,347
- It doesn't matter for us. - We aren't playing that.

1002
00:37:34,347 --> 00:37:35,907
(Why on earth are we running?)

1003
00:37:35,907 --> 00:37:38,147
- Oh, we don't have to play that. - Unbelievable.

1004
00:37:38,147 --> 00:37:39,247
- We don't have to. - That's right.

1005
00:37:39,907 --> 00:37:44,907
(Let's just watch them fight over a name tag.)

1006
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:46,707
Look. Seok Jin isn't going easy on her at all.

1007
00:37:46,707 --> 00:37:47,847
(They are trying hard.)

1008
00:37:48,077 --> 00:37:49,547
Wait, Seok Jin. Stop.

1009
00:37:49,547 --> 00:37:51,407
- Seok Jin, stop it! - So Min.

1010
00:37:51,407 --> 00:37:55,047
(A battle between one who must keep the tag versus ones who must remove)

1011
00:37:55,047 --> 00:37:58,047
(The name tag is removed at last.)

1012
00:37:58,047 --> 00:38:01,347
(Seok Jin and So Min removed the tag almost at the same time.)

1013
00:38:01,347 --> 00:38:02,377
It's over!

1014
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,377
(Which of them removed Ji Hyo's name tag?)

1015
00:38:05,377 --> 00:38:07,277
- Who removed the tag? - So Min removed it, right?

1016
00:38:07,277 --> 00:38:08,447
No, I did it.

1017
00:38:08,447 --> 00:38:09,547
(What are you talking about?)

1018
00:38:10,017 --> 00:38:12,017
(After replaying the video, )

1019
00:38:12,017 --> 00:38:13,447
(So Min removed the name tag first.)

1020
00:38:13,447 --> 00:38:16,047
Seok Jin, you just grabbed it, but it was her who removed it.

1021
00:38:16,477 --> 00:38:18,207
- It was you? - Hey, when we removed it,

1022
00:38:18,207 --> 00:38:20,447
- it was in my hand. - Hey, hold on.

1023
00:38:20,447 --> 00:38:23,577
- Hey, just let me hang this. - Don't you agree? It's the truth.

1024
00:38:23,577 --> 00:38:25,477
Gosh, it hurts!

1025
00:38:25,477 --> 00:38:28,377
(He accepts the Accordance Badge wholeheartedly.)

1026
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,377
Hey!

1027
00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:31,947
(Can their decisions be all different next?)

1028
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:34,647
(They set out for the next discordance.)

1029
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:35,747
While we are moving,

1030
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:38,977
you will get to play a bonus mission for discordance.

1031
00:38:38,977 --> 00:38:40,407
Okay. Great.

1032
00:38:40,847 --> 00:38:42,307
We won't get the Accordance Badge, right?

1033
00:38:42,307 --> 00:38:43,347
No, you won't.

1034
00:38:43,347 --> 00:38:44,647
- Why? - All right.

1035
00:38:44,647 --> 00:38:46,547
This is a bonus mission for discordance.

1036
00:38:46,747 --> 00:38:48,877
I am going to present you questions.

1037
00:38:48,977 --> 00:38:50,547
The mission is accomplished when every member...

1038
00:38:50,547 --> 00:38:52,707
- tells different, correct answers. - Really?

1039
00:38:53,017 --> 00:38:55,517
- I think this is manageable. - If a member can't...

1040
00:38:55,517 --> 00:38:58,407
answer the question or repeat someone else's answer,

1041
00:38:58,407 --> 00:39:01,607
the member will pay five dollars as a penalty.

1042
00:39:01,677 --> 00:39:03,877
- That's a lot of money. - We can't repeat the answers.

1043
00:39:04,017 --> 00:39:06,247
- That's too high of a fine. - You are too cruel.

1044
00:39:06,247 --> 00:39:07,947
- It's a big fine. - I only have 12 dollars.

1045
00:39:07,947 --> 00:39:09,207
- It's not a bonus mission. - It's a lot of money.

1046
00:39:09,207 --> 00:39:11,207
If all of you manage to say different answers,

1047
00:39:11,207 --> 00:39:14,447
only one member of your choice will receive five dollars.

1048
00:39:14,447 --> 00:39:15,447
Really?

1049
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:16,847
- This is great. - We can play rock-paper-scissors.

1050
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:18,277
- We can do that. - Here it is.

1051
00:39:18,477 --> 00:39:19,547
Ji Hyo will start.

1052
00:39:19,677 --> 00:39:21,207
Get ready.

1053
00:39:21,207 --> 00:39:22,547
Start.

1054
00:39:22,547 --> 00:39:24,077
Who is your closest, ideal type among celebrities?

1055
00:39:25,347 --> 00:39:27,847
- Time's up! - Pay five dollars.

1056
00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:29,577
Who is your closest, ideal type among celebrities?

1057
00:39:29,707 --> 00:39:30,907
(It is...)

1058
00:39:30,907 --> 00:39:32,877
- Time's up! - Pay five dollars.

1059
00:39:32,877 --> 00:39:34,307
- It was a hard question. - Why can't you answer that?

1060
00:39:34,307 --> 00:39:35,847
I can come up with 10 names.

1061
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,247
- Why couldn't you answer that? - Pay five dollars.

1062
00:39:38,307 --> 00:39:39,377
Pay up.

1063
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,907
- Ji Hyo has a lot of money. - Okay.

1064
00:39:41,077 --> 00:39:42,377
- This is hard. - She keeps losing money.

1065
00:39:43,707 --> 00:39:45,577
I'd like to ask Ji Hyo...

1066
00:39:45,577 --> 00:39:47,517
- why she couldn't answer. - Why couldn't you, Ji Hyo?

1067
00:39:47,517 --> 00:39:49,447
You could have just said Seok Jin's name.

1068
00:39:49,607 --> 00:39:52,777
Even though it's just a game, I don't think I can say his name.

1069
00:39:52,777 --> 00:39:55,207
(She bluntly rejects Seok Jin.)

1070
00:39:55,207 --> 00:39:56,277
(He's rejected.)

1071
00:39:56,277 --> 00:39:58,477
- Gosh, aren't you picky? - Even if it's a game...

1072
00:39:58,477 --> 00:40:00,147
- Se Chan will start now. - Okay.

1073
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,407
- I won't fail. - Nice.

1074
00:40:01,477 --> 00:40:03,447
Get ready. Start.

1075
00:40:03,447 --> 00:40:04,747
Who is your closet, ideal type among celebrities?

1076
00:40:05,077 --> 00:40:08,047
(Unable to talk)

1077
00:40:09,517 --> 00:40:10,677
- Time's up. - Lee Ha Nee.

1078
00:40:11,147 --> 00:40:12,807
(The schemer waited...)

1079
00:40:12,807 --> 00:40:15,547
( for the right timing and robbed him of 5 dollars)

1080
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:16,907
Hey, what was that?

1081
00:40:16,907 --> 00:40:18,307
- He covered my mouth. - What?

1082
00:40:18,607 --> 00:40:20,247
What do you think? Should he pay or not?

1083
00:40:20,247 --> 00:40:21,877
- He should pay. - He must.

1084
00:40:22,077 --> 00:40:23,577
But starting now, this isn't acceptable.

1085
00:40:23,577 --> 00:40:25,607
- I agree. - No one can do this from now on.

1086
00:40:25,607 --> 00:40:27,907
(Let's be fair.)

1087
00:40:28,707 --> 00:40:30,017
(This is how they're going to play?)

1088
00:40:30,017 --> 00:40:32,177
- Promise, everyone. - We can't cover someone's mouth?

1089
00:40:32,177 --> 00:40:33,377
- No. - I can do other things, right?

1090
00:40:33,377 --> 00:40:34,707
- I accept. - Okay.

1091
00:40:34,707 --> 00:40:36,877
- Se Chan, it was funny. - It was funny.

1092
00:40:37,247 --> 00:40:38,807
Because of you, we could make a rule.

1093
00:40:38,807 --> 00:40:40,477
- You can do it. - I can do it.

1094
00:40:40,477 --> 00:40:41,877
- Cheer up. - Let me start again.

1095
00:40:41,877 --> 00:40:44,107
If your answer doesn't make sense, it's considered incorrect.

1096
00:40:44,107 --> 00:40:45,607
- Of course. - Really? You can't do that.

1097
00:40:45,607 --> 00:40:46,977
- That's reasonable. - Let me ask you a question.

1098
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,077
It's different from Jae Seok's Game.

1099
00:40:48,077 --> 00:40:49,277
It doesn't exist anymore, right?

1100
00:40:49,277 --> 00:40:50,277
- It doesn't. - It's gone.

1101
00:40:50,277 --> 00:40:53,177
- I'm pressured to change the name. - Change it to something else.

1102
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:55,107
(We were pressured by SBS.)

1103
00:40:55,107 --> 00:40:56,407
Was the order from your supervisors?

1104
00:40:56,407 --> 00:40:58,347
I never knew that the game could disappear because of its name.

1105
00:40:58,947 --> 00:41:00,707
- It was because of the name. - I understand.

1106
00:41:00,707 --> 00:41:02,707
- The name can have a negative vibe. - Exactly.

1107
00:41:03,177 --> 00:41:05,207
Get ready. Start.

1108
00:41:05,207 --> 00:41:06,377
Whom do you want as a guest?

1109
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:09,677
(Whom do you want as a guest on Running Man?)

1110
00:41:09,907 --> 00:41:11,347
Hwang Jung Min.

1111
00:41:12,647 --> 00:41:13,707
- Byul. - He answered it?

1112
00:41:13,707 --> 00:41:14,877
Ahn Jae Wook.

1113
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,477
Noh Sa Yeon.

1114
00:41:17,077 --> 00:41:18,247
Time's up!

1115
00:41:18,407 --> 00:41:19,407
Noh Sa Yeon.

1116
00:41:19,407 --> 00:41:22,577
(That... Goodness.)

1117
00:41:23,707 --> 00:41:25,247
I was ready to say my answer.

1118
00:41:25,247 --> 00:41:26,377
Five dollars?

1119
00:41:27,147 --> 00:41:28,677
- It caught me off guard. - It's a bit hard.

1120
00:41:28,677 --> 00:41:30,907
I thought it was going to end with Seok Jin.

1121
00:41:30,907 --> 00:41:32,517
- You didn't know. - What was your answer?

1122
00:41:32,517 --> 00:41:34,107
- Here you go. - Okay.

1123
00:41:34,107 --> 00:41:35,207
We will start with Jong Kook.

1124
00:41:35,777 --> 00:41:38,547
Get ready. Start.

1125
00:41:38,547 --> 00:41:40,277
Whom do you think is the hottest singer now?

1126
00:41:40,477 --> 00:41:41,607
Yoon Eun Hye.

1127
00:41:41,777 --> 00:41:42,847
Jun Ji Hyun.

1128
00:41:43,207 --> 00:41:44,447
(What?)

1129
00:41:44,447 --> 00:41:45,777
- Gary. - Jong Kook.

1130
00:41:45,777 --> 00:41:47,017
- Wait. - Is Ji Hyun a singer?

1131
00:41:47,017 --> 00:41:48,707
- You were to name a singer. - Name a singer.

1132
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:50,247
- She... - She didn't even release an album.

1133
00:41:50,247 --> 00:41:51,407
Released a song.

1134
00:41:51,407 --> 00:41:52,447
Where? Sing the song.

1135
00:41:52,447 --> 00:41:53,947
- Start. - Where did you hear it?

1136
00:41:54,047 --> 00:41:55,577
- Hold on. - Didn't she release an album?

1137
00:41:55,577 --> 00:41:56,847
Let me tell you.

1138
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,347
She was in one of G.o.d's songs.

1139
00:41:59,347 --> 00:42:01,017
(She screamed "No!" in the song.)

1140
00:42:01,777 --> 00:42:03,607
("Lies" by G.o.d)

1141
00:42:03,607 --> 00:42:05,547
(No, no!)

1142
00:42:06,577 --> 00:42:08,377
- That's right. - That's not singing.

1143
00:42:08,377 --> 00:42:10,477
- She was in the song. - It's "Lies" by G.o.d.

1144
00:42:10,477 --> 00:42:11,517
It's not acceptable.

1145
00:42:11,517 --> 00:42:13,247
- Come on. - We can't accept this answer.

1146
00:42:13,247 --> 00:42:14,707
- Pay up. - Pay five dollars.

1147
00:42:14,807 --> 00:42:16,307
- Give him the money. - Goodness.

1148
00:42:16,307 --> 00:42:18,747
He doesn't have a lot of money. He has only 11 dollars.

1149
00:42:19,807 --> 00:42:21,107
- Jae Seok. - Yes.

1150
00:42:21,107 --> 00:42:22,577
- Get ready. - There are only a few left.

1151
00:42:23,047 --> 00:42:24,777
Start.

1152
00:42:24,777 --> 00:42:26,277
What is your favourite late night food?

1153
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:27,647
Late night food? Tteokbokki!

1154
00:42:27,647 --> 00:42:28,707
- Jokbal. - Kimchi jjigae.

1155
00:42:28,707 --> 00:42:29,777
- Bossam. - Whelks.

1156
00:42:29,777 --> 00:42:31,077
- Sundae. - Doenjang jjigae.

1157
00:42:31,407 --> 00:42:32,407
Kimchi.

1158
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:34,777
(It's late night food...)

1159
00:42:34,777 --> 00:42:37,107
(and kimchi is your favorite?)

1160
00:42:37,447 --> 00:42:39,377
- His favourite is kimchi. - No way.

1161
00:42:39,377 --> 00:42:40,447
What's wrong with that?

1162
00:42:40,447 --> 00:42:42,247
- Seriously? - It's a side dish.

1163
00:42:42,907 --> 00:42:45,377
- He keeps losing at this game. - Jong Kook.

1164
00:42:45,377 --> 00:42:47,047
Let's keep playing this game.

1165
00:42:47,247 --> 00:42:48,707
- He's not good at this. - He lost again.

1166
00:42:48,707 --> 00:42:51,577
- You should said something else. - He doesn't eat a lot.

1167
00:42:51,847 --> 00:42:52,877
We'll start with Ji Hyo.

1168
00:42:52,877 --> 00:42:55,147
- We'll play the last round. - Okay.

1169
00:42:55,517 --> 00:42:57,107
Start.

1170
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,607
Who is your closet, ideal type among celebrities?

1171
00:42:58,607 --> 00:43:00,047
- Seok Jin. - Ha Nee.

1172
00:43:03,307 --> 00:43:05,107
(Seok Jin fails to answer.)

1173
00:43:05,107 --> 00:43:06,247
Time's up!

1174
00:43:06,247 --> 00:43:08,017
- Hey! - He did it for your sake!

1175
00:43:08,147 --> 00:43:09,477
- You can't name an ideal type. - Right.

1176
00:43:09,477 --> 00:43:10,747
- You can't name an ideal type. - You are married.

1177
00:43:10,747 --> 00:43:12,747
- You have a wife. - I can name my ideal type.

1178
00:43:13,807 --> 00:43:17,447
(You have a beautiful wife. How can you name someone else?)

1179
00:43:17,517 --> 00:43:20,077
- I bet she is thanking me now. - I agree.

1180
00:43:20,177 --> 00:43:22,707
- I'm sure she's thankful. - I can't believe I'm paying for it.

1181
00:43:22,707 --> 00:43:23,977
- I agree. - It's not about money.

1182
00:43:23,977 --> 00:43:24,977
You saw what happened though right?

1183
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,207
Ji Hyo named Seok Jin even though she said she couldn't earlier.

1184
00:43:27,207 --> 00:43:30,747
(This is a shocking confession of Ji Hyo.)

1185
00:43:30,747 --> 00:43:32,547
- What's up with you? - She said she won't name him,

1186
00:43:32,747 --> 00:43:35,407
- but she said his name. - Ji Hyo.

1187
00:43:35,517 --> 00:43:36,517
- What's up with you? - Forget it!

1188
00:43:36,517 --> 00:43:38,277
- I'm sorry that I'm married. - Get off me.

1189
00:43:38,477 --> 00:43:39,807
I'm sorry that I'm married.

1190
00:43:40,307 --> 00:43:43,977
- I didn't know. I'm sorry. - "I'm sorry that I'm married."

1191
00:43:44,777 --> 00:43:47,207
- I didn't mean it. - I'm sorry.

1192
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,507
- "Seok Jin". - Okay.

1193
00:43:48,507 --> 00:43:50,947
In five minutes, we will arrive at the restaurant.

1194
00:43:50,947 --> 00:43:53,047
All of us can have lunch, right?

1195
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,307
You'll see.

1196
00:43:54,307 --> 00:43:56,177
- What if we can't have lunch? - Do we have to buy our own meal?

1197
00:43:56,177 --> 00:43:59,047
- No way. - Our choices have to be different?

1198
00:43:59,047 --> 00:44:00,847
- That makes sense. - Gosh, Seok Jin.

1199
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,447
I at least want to have a meal.

1200
00:44:02,447 --> 00:44:04,447
I can eat everything at this time of day.

1201
00:44:05,677 --> 00:44:10,507
(With suspicions, they arrive. What is the mission at the restaurant?)

1202
00:44:10,707 --> 00:44:13,207
We are going to enter the restaurant now.

1203
00:44:13,207 --> 00:44:16,047
- Enter randomly one by one. - Pardon?

1204
00:44:16,177 --> 00:44:19,207
- I knew it. It's about the menu. - Who wants to go first?

1205
00:44:19,207 --> 00:44:20,707
- Se Chan, why don't you go first? - Hey.

1206
00:44:20,707 --> 00:44:21,707
Sure.

1207
00:44:21,707 --> 00:44:23,177
- Go. - Right now...

1208
00:44:24,707 --> 00:44:26,107
(A Chinese restaurant in Seoul)

1209
00:44:26,107 --> 00:44:27,207
This is the place.

1210
00:44:27,407 --> 00:44:28,877
Hand-pulled noodles.

1211
00:44:31,907 --> 00:44:33,207
(What did Se Chan see?)

1212
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:34,207
I have to choose among them?

1213
00:44:34,207 --> 00:44:36,707
(What did Se Chan see?)

1214
00:44:37,807 --> 00:44:41,807
(A menu with 8 dishes?)

1215
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:44,207
This mission is What Will You Eat?

1216
00:44:44,207 --> 00:44:46,907
(The mission is What Will You Eat?)

1217
00:44:46,907 --> 00:44:49,947
The mission is accomplished if everyone choose a different dish.

1218
00:44:49,947 --> 00:44:51,107
(They must choose different dishes.)

1219
00:44:51,107 --> 00:44:54,277
If two or more members' decisions overlap, it's a failed mission.

1220
00:44:54,277 --> 00:44:57,347
The members who choose the same dish can't eat.

1221
00:44:57,347 --> 00:44:59,777
(The members who choose the same dish can't eat.)

1222
00:45:00,947 --> 00:45:02,507
(They can only have the dish they order.)

1223
00:45:02,507 --> 00:45:04,677
- What? Those members can't eat? - No.

1224
00:45:05,207 --> 00:45:09,377
(Guessing the others' choices is the key.)

1225
00:45:09,377 --> 00:45:11,647
(It's what you want to eat versus what others won't choose.)

1226
00:45:11,647 --> 00:45:12,977
Jae Seok will choose jjajangmyeon.

1227
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:14,777
Jong Kook will choose jjamppong.

1228
00:45:15,277 --> 00:45:17,707
- I want to eat what I want. - There's only one dish for me.

1229
00:45:17,707 --> 00:45:19,107
- There's only one. - Jjamppong?

1230
00:45:19,107 --> 00:45:20,107
Yes.

1231
00:45:20,147 --> 00:45:21,407
My goodness.

1232
00:45:22,307 --> 00:45:24,247
(He knows what Jong Kook likes.)

1233
00:45:24,247 --> 00:45:26,307
(There are many dishes to choose.)

1234
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:28,247
It's between Tangsuyuk and fried mandu.

1235
00:45:28,907 --> 00:45:33,507
(Which dish will no one choose?)

1236
00:45:33,507 --> 00:45:35,847
I choose fried mandu.

1237
00:45:36,207 --> 00:45:37,407
Fried mandu.

1238
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,207
I don't like my personality.

1239
00:45:39,277 --> 00:45:41,777
To be honest, I want to choose what I want like Jong Kook.

1240
00:45:42,107 --> 00:45:43,207
I choose fried mandu.

1241
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,307
We'll order fried mandu. Please go upstairs.

1242
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:46,677
(Se Chan chooses fried mandu.)

1243
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:48,407
(It's Seok Jin's turn.)

1244
00:45:48,407 --> 00:45:50,107
- Do I choose? - Yes.

1245
00:45:50,107 --> 00:45:51,947
We discussed before I came.

1246
00:45:53,547 --> 00:45:54,947
I choose the most expensive dish.

1247
00:45:54,947 --> 00:45:57,877
(He chooses the most expensive one.)

1248
00:45:57,877 --> 00:45:59,077
I choose Tangsuyuk.

1249
00:45:59,807 --> 00:46:00,847
Tangsuyuk?

1250
00:46:00,847 --> 00:46:02,777
People won't choose Tangsuyuk.

1251
00:46:02,777 --> 00:46:04,477
I bet they want to eat soup.

1252
00:46:06,077 --> 00:46:07,407
I can't eat?

1253
00:46:08,347 --> 00:46:09,907
(It's Haha's turn.)

1254
00:46:09,907 --> 00:46:13,177
Seok Jin definitely chose Tangsuyuk.

1255
00:46:13,477 --> 00:46:16,147
(He's exactly right.)

1256
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,677
When it's complicated,

1257
00:46:18,807 --> 00:46:20,107
it's fried rice.

1258
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:23,507
When it's depressing, it's ulmyeon.

1259
00:46:24,377 --> 00:46:28,007
(Will others choose fried rice or ulmyeon?)

1260
00:46:28,007 --> 00:46:29,147
I feel depressed.

1261
00:46:30,647 --> 00:46:31,777
I choose ulmyeon.

1262
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,477
(Haha chooses ulmyeon.)

1263
00:46:33,477 --> 00:46:35,877
- It's this way. - I actually want jjajangmyeon.

1264
00:46:37,577 --> 00:46:40,607
(Everyone is in discordance so far, and Jae Seok enters.)

1265
00:46:40,607 --> 00:46:42,847
I must choose a dish that no one else would choose...

1266
00:46:43,547 --> 00:46:45,877
while it's something I want to eat.

1267
00:46:45,877 --> 00:46:48,407
Someone might choose japchae rice.

1268
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:50,207
I'll choose something uncertain.

1269
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:53,947
(He thinks of choosing a dish that people may not pick.)

1270
00:46:53,947 --> 00:46:55,047
Tangsuyuk?

1271
00:46:56,077 --> 00:46:57,847
(It's a time of distress.)

1272
00:46:57,847 --> 00:46:59,607
I don't think it's Tangsuyuk.

1273
00:47:00,077 --> 00:47:01,107
How about fried mandu?

1274
00:47:02,377 --> 00:47:03,747
He's taking long.

1275
00:47:05,047 --> 00:47:07,607
(Why is he taking so long?)

1276
00:47:09,377 --> 00:47:10,377
Tangsuyuk.

1277
00:47:10,377 --> 00:47:11,907
(He chooses Tangsuyuk.)

1278
00:47:11,907 --> 00:47:13,107
What about japchae rice?

1279
00:47:13,107 --> 00:47:15,077
(Is japchae rice better?)

1280
00:47:15,077 --> 00:47:16,707
How about Tangsuyuk or fried mandu?

1281
00:47:17,547 --> 00:47:18,607
I don't know anymore.

1282
00:47:18,607 --> 00:47:19,777
(Which did Jae Seok choose?)

1283
00:47:20,177 --> 00:47:21,647
May I eat some pickled radish?

1284
00:47:21,977 --> 00:47:23,007
You should let us eat it.

1285
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:24,877
- We can eat it, right? - Are we in a cage?

1286
00:47:24,877 --> 00:47:26,277
I should eat just in case.

1287
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:27,647
(Eat something in case you can't later.)

1288
00:47:27,647 --> 00:47:28,847
We can eat it.

1289
00:47:29,677 --> 00:47:31,407
- He's here. - Jae Seok.

1290
00:47:31,407 --> 00:47:32,477
He's here.

1291
00:47:32,477 --> 00:47:33,777
Is it stir-fried or deep-fried?

1292
00:47:33,777 --> 00:47:35,177
Jae Seok definitely chose jjajangmyeon.

1293
00:47:35,607 --> 00:47:36,677
Right?

1294
00:47:36,677 --> 00:47:37,707
(Did he choose jjajangmyeon?)

1295
00:47:38,507 --> 00:47:41,207
Some dishes will coincide,

1296
00:47:41,207 --> 00:47:43,607
but others probably chose unexpected dishes.

1297
00:47:44,847 --> 00:47:46,707
Should I consider what I want to eat?

1298
00:47:46,707 --> 00:47:48,507
(Should I choose what I want?)

1299
00:47:49,877 --> 00:47:54,077
(Inside the bus while Ji Hyo chooses...)

1300
00:47:54,877 --> 00:47:58,477
(So Min starts to behave in a strange way.)

1301
00:48:00,807 --> 00:48:02,677
- Are you sleeping? - No.

1302
00:48:02,947 --> 00:48:04,377
Were you sleeping?

1303
00:48:05,147 --> 00:48:06,907
She tends to fall asleep easily.

1304
00:48:06,907 --> 00:48:08,377
I didn't fall asleep.

1305
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,177
I got tired all of a sudden.

1306
00:48:10,177 --> 00:48:12,277
- What's wrong with me? - How is that possible?

1307
00:48:12,277 --> 00:48:14,077
(She thought about which to choose.)

1308
00:48:14,607 --> 00:48:17,607
Can you see me?

1309
00:48:17,607 --> 00:48:19,577
(We can see everything except her eyes.)

1310
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,377
- You're really silly. - Why?

1311
00:48:23,177 --> 00:48:25,277
Why do you say that? I'm not.

1312
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,607
Right, Jong Kook?

1313
00:48:26,607 --> 00:48:27,877
- That's why you look good together. - Next person is up.

1314
00:48:28,847 --> 00:48:30,977
Gosh, stop it.

1315
00:48:30,977 --> 00:48:32,507
Next person is up.

1316
00:48:32,607 --> 00:48:33,777
I'll go.

1317
00:48:34,847 --> 00:48:36,507
Enjoy your time together.

1318
00:48:37,747 --> 00:48:39,277
I always support you.

1319
00:48:40,607 --> 00:48:44,707
Then you take them away from me.

1320
00:48:44,707 --> 00:48:45,977
Come on.

1321
00:48:45,977 --> 00:48:47,377
It was also the case in Russia.

1322
00:48:47,377 --> 00:48:48,577
Kwang Soo.

1323
00:48:48,577 --> 00:48:50,077
Kwang Soo.

1324
00:48:50,277 --> 00:48:51,277
Yes?

1325
00:48:51,277 --> 00:48:52,407
Good luck.

1326
00:48:53,507 --> 00:48:54,807
Is it high calorie or not?

1327
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:55,977
It's high.

1328
00:48:55,977 --> 00:48:58,607
Ji Hyo definitely chose either jjamppong or jjajangmyeon.

1329
00:48:58,607 --> 00:49:00,577
- No, I didn't. - Is it deep-fried?

1330
00:49:00,577 --> 00:49:02,647
- I didn't choose them. - You like them, don't you?

1331
00:49:02,647 --> 00:49:04,577
Ulmyeon is...

1332
00:49:04,977 --> 00:49:06,547
something you can order.

1333
00:49:06,547 --> 00:49:08,477
I bet Jong Kook will order ulmyeon.

1334
00:49:08,847 --> 00:49:11,647
When it's depressing, it's ulmyeon.

1335
00:49:11,647 --> 00:49:12,707
(Don't order my ulmyeon.)

1336
00:49:13,447 --> 00:49:14,907
Ulmyeon?

1337
00:49:14,907 --> 00:49:16,547
(He's been indecisive for five minutes.)

1338
00:49:17,277 --> 00:49:20,307
I bet no one ordered ulmyeon.

1339
00:49:20,307 --> 00:49:22,247
(Will he order it?)

1340
00:49:23,607 --> 00:49:25,947
- What's there to think about? - Why is he thinking so long?

1341
00:49:26,107 --> 00:49:28,877
- There's no right answer. - What's there to think about?

1342
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,147
Are you talking to me?

1343
00:49:32,877 --> 00:49:34,277
What's there to think about?

1344
00:49:35,147 --> 00:49:36,447
Are you talking to me?

1345
00:49:37,147 --> 00:49:38,177
I meant everyone.

1346
00:49:38,177 --> 00:49:40,377
You seem too bold today.

1347
00:49:41,207 --> 00:49:43,147
Please sit. Did you think a lot?

1348
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:44,877
You don't eat deep-fried food, right?

1349
00:49:44,877 --> 00:49:46,447
I don't.

1350
00:49:46,447 --> 00:49:47,477
(Did he choose ulmyeon?)

1351
00:49:48,307 --> 00:49:49,547
Let's see.

1352
00:49:50,777 --> 00:49:54,007
I can't give up because I might be able to win.

1353
00:49:54,007 --> 00:49:56,007
(He cannot give up winning.)

1354
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,277
I wondered why everyone was taking so long.

1355
00:50:00,047 --> 00:50:01,307
I can't choose.

1356
00:50:01,307 --> 00:50:02,547
(Now he understands.)

1357
00:50:02,547 --> 00:50:03,807
(Which shall I choose?)

1358
00:50:04,007 --> 00:50:05,377
Can you say stop?

1359
00:50:06,107 --> 00:50:08,047
Stop.

1360
00:50:08,447 --> 00:50:09,477
(Is she playing that old game?)

1361
00:50:09,477 --> 00:50:12,107
I choose japchae rice. It's way too common.

1362
00:50:12,107 --> 00:50:14,277
I bet Seok Jin chose it.

1363
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:19,107
Could you say stop?

1364
00:50:20,077 --> 00:50:21,107
Stop.

1365
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:25,247
I don't want Tangsuyuk.

1366
00:50:26,407 --> 00:50:28,707
Why did you ask us to say stop?

1367
00:50:29,677 --> 00:50:31,477
This is the last time. Please say stop.

1368
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:33,477
Stop.

1369
00:50:33,477 --> 00:50:34,677
(The last choice is fried rice.)

1370
00:50:34,677 --> 00:50:35,707
I don't like it.

1371
00:50:35,707 --> 00:50:37,177
What is it?

1372
00:50:37,907 --> 00:50:39,477
(She doesn't like fried rice.)

1373
00:50:39,477 --> 00:50:40,507
(The game was pointless.)

1374
00:50:40,507 --> 00:50:43,447
It was fried rice, but I choose...

1375
00:50:43,777 --> 00:50:47,277
(Which dish did So Min choose?)

1376
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,207
(Se Chan, Seok Jin, and Haha's dishes are revealed.)

1377
00:50:49,207 --> 00:50:52,447
(All 8 members made their decisions.)

1378
00:50:52,577 --> 00:50:54,577
We have an interesting result.

1379
00:50:54,577 --> 00:50:56,407
- Is that so? - Many must coincide.

1380
00:50:56,407 --> 00:50:58,377
- My goodness. - Many of us probably...

1381
00:50:58,377 --> 00:50:59,807
- chose the same dish. - I don't think so.

1382
00:51:00,677 --> 00:51:05,377
(Probability of everyone in discordance is 1 out of 40,320.)

1383
00:51:05,377 --> 00:51:07,577
(Will everyone be in discordance?)

1384
00:51:07,577 --> 00:51:10,307
- I'll announce the result. - Please, please.

1385
00:51:10,307 --> 00:51:12,507
I'll start with Seok Jin.

1386
00:51:12,507 --> 00:51:13,977
He chose Tangsuyuk.

1387
00:51:13,977 --> 00:51:16,077
- I almost chose Tangsuyuk. - Thank goodness.

1388
00:51:16,077 --> 00:51:18,177
(He's relieved.)

1389
00:51:18,347 --> 00:51:20,707
(Which dish did Jae Seok choose?)

1390
00:51:21,647 --> 00:51:22,847
Tangsuyuk.

1391
00:51:22,977 --> 00:51:25,777
We'll order Tangsuyuk for you. Please go upstairs.

1392
00:51:27,607 --> 00:51:28,807
(Wait)

1393
00:51:28,807 --> 00:51:29,807
May I change it?

1394
00:51:30,647 --> 00:51:31,747
May I change it?

1395
00:51:31,747 --> 00:51:33,047
Change to what?

1396
00:51:34,077 --> 00:51:35,247
I choose japchae rice.

1397
00:51:36,547 --> 00:51:38,847
I almost chose Tangsuyuk.

1398
00:51:39,747 --> 00:51:42,847
Next is japchae rice.

1399
00:51:42,847 --> 00:51:46,547
(It'll be amazing if he's the only one.)

1400
00:51:46,547 --> 00:51:48,647
Jae Seok, Jong Kook and So Min.

1401
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,777
(They all chose japchae rice.)

1402
00:51:52,307 --> 00:51:54,247
(3 members chose japchae rice.)

1403
00:51:54,247 --> 00:51:55,377
Gosh.

1404
00:51:55,377 --> 00:51:56,747
That's so many.

1405
00:51:58,807 --> 00:52:01,347
- Congratulations. - Many people chose that one.

1406
00:52:01,347 --> 00:52:03,277
- Congratulations. - Why did you choose japchae rice?

1407
00:52:03,277 --> 00:52:05,277
Don't you like jjajangmyeon?

1408
00:52:05,447 --> 00:52:08,477
I chose it because it was uncertain.

1409
00:52:08,477 --> 00:52:11,247
The three will receive three Accordance Badges each.

1410
00:52:12,047 --> 00:52:14,347
- Jae Seok. - How many badges do you have?

1411
00:52:14,347 --> 00:52:15,847
- You have 7. - You'll pay 3 dollars.

1412
00:52:15,977 --> 00:52:17,547
He has seven badges.

1413
00:52:18,477 --> 00:52:20,977
So Min has three badges.

1414
00:52:21,177 --> 00:52:22,777
My goodness.

1415
00:52:22,947 --> 00:52:24,277
Poor Jae Seok.

1416
00:52:24,277 --> 00:52:26,547
Next is ulmyeon.

1417
00:52:26,547 --> 00:52:28,307
It must coincide.

1418
00:52:28,307 --> 00:52:31,277
(Will Haha get to eat lunch?)

1419
00:52:31,277 --> 00:52:34,207
Haha and Ji Hyo chose ulmyeon.

1420
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,247
When it's depressing, it's ulmyeon.

1421
00:52:37,377 --> 00:52:39,477
- It's jjajangmyeon when annoying - Pay two dollars each.

1422
00:52:39,507 --> 00:52:42,147
- Give it to me. - I'll enjoy my food alone.

1423
00:52:42,507 --> 00:52:44,647
Let's enjoy our food, Seok Jin.

1424
00:52:44,647 --> 00:52:46,177
This is great.

1425
00:52:46,447 --> 00:52:48,577
- This is good. - The rest of you.

1426
00:52:48,577 --> 00:52:49,607
Yes?

1427
00:52:49,877 --> 00:52:53,177
(Se Chan chose fried mandu.)

1428
00:52:53,177 --> 00:52:54,447
Seok Jin.

1429
00:52:54,447 --> 00:52:55,847
He chose Tangsuyuk.

1430
00:52:55,847 --> 00:52:57,107
(Seok Jin chose Tangsuyuk.)

1431
00:52:57,107 --> 00:53:01,477
(Their fate depends on Kwang Soo's choice.)

1432
00:53:01,477 --> 00:53:05,177
Se Chan and Kwang Soo chose fried mandu.

1433
00:53:05,177 --> 00:53:08,277
(They both chose fried mandu.)

1434
00:53:09,177 --> 00:53:11,307
(It's unfortunate.)

1435
00:53:11,307 --> 00:53:12,477
Are you serious?

1436
00:53:13,677 --> 00:53:15,147
I bet no one chose fried mandu.

1437
00:53:16,807 --> 00:53:18,307
I choose fried mandu.

1438
00:53:18,307 --> 00:53:20,047
(Kwang Soo was sure of himself.)

1439
00:53:20,407 --> 00:53:23,507
They chose fried mandu for a meal.

1440
00:53:23,677 --> 00:53:26,807
Fried mandu is too little, and it doesn't look cool.

1441
00:53:27,107 --> 00:53:29,477
How could you choose fried mandu?

1442
00:53:30,277 --> 00:53:31,447
Goodness.

1443
00:53:31,447 --> 00:53:32,747
I like fried mandu.

1444
00:53:32,747 --> 00:53:35,177
I love fried mandu much more than you.

1445
00:53:35,307 --> 00:53:36,507
Put on the badges.

1446
00:53:36,807 --> 00:53:38,347
Here's Tangsuyuk.

1447
00:53:38,347 --> 00:53:40,947
(Seok Jin gets to enjoy Tangsuyuk by himself.)

1448
00:53:41,807 --> 00:53:43,377
- It looks delicious. - May I smell it?

1449
00:53:43,377 --> 00:53:44,807
(He sniffs it.)

1450
00:53:44,807 --> 00:53:46,377
It smells good.

1451
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:49,907
(He really wants some.)

1452
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:54,577
(Why did you order fried mandu?)

1453
00:53:55,777 --> 00:53:57,607
- Goodness. - Give us one more chance.

1454
00:53:57,607 --> 00:53:59,447
- Just one more. - It's the last chance.

1455
00:54:00,107 --> 00:54:01,607
In that case,

1456
00:54:01,877 --> 00:54:03,747
I'll give you the last chance.

1457
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:06,247
Choose a dish...

1458
00:54:06,247 --> 00:54:07,677
- individually. - How about rock-paper-scissors?

1459
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:09,147
The winner should eat.

1460
00:54:09,147 --> 00:54:10,477
- Okay. - Eat something delicious.

1461
00:54:10,807 --> 00:54:12,847
(They're working hard.)

1462
00:54:13,377 --> 00:54:14,777
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1463
00:54:14,777 --> 00:54:16,107
(They play rock-paper-scissors.)

1464
00:54:16,107 --> 00:54:17,447
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1465
00:54:17,907 --> 00:54:19,007
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1466
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:22,277
(Jae Seok, Jong Kook, and Kwang Soo win.)

1467
00:54:22,877 --> 00:54:24,177
Okay.

1468
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,077
- It's not yet. - The three of us should play.

1469
00:54:26,577 --> 00:54:28,347
Gosh, this is annoying.

1470
00:54:28,347 --> 00:54:30,107
We haven't played together in a long time.

1471
00:54:30,107 --> 00:54:31,207
I'll eat.

1472
00:54:31,207 --> 00:54:33,447
Normally, I'm the winner among the three.

1473
00:54:33,647 --> 00:54:35,047
Right?

1474
00:54:35,047 --> 00:54:36,307
It's true.

1475
00:54:36,307 --> 00:54:37,907
Jong Kook is usually the winner.

1476
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:39,277
- We must break the habit. - I will.

1477
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:40,747
(He wants to defeat Jong Kook.)

1478
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:44,907
(Jong Kook always avoids all penalties.)

1479
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:49,747
(That's why the unlucky ones suffered.)

1480
00:54:49,747 --> 00:54:53,147
(They're determined to take revenge.)

1481
00:54:53,147 --> 00:54:54,477
- We must break the habit. - I will.

1482
00:54:54,477 --> 00:54:55,977
Rock-paper-scissors.

1483
00:54:55,977 --> 00:54:58,947
(They fail to defeat Jong Kook.)

1484
00:54:59,777 --> 00:55:02,677
(I was hoping in vain.)

1485
00:55:02,677 --> 00:55:06,047
- It's better to lose first. - Right.

1486
00:55:06,077 --> 00:55:07,777
You can never win.

1487
00:55:08,477 --> 00:55:09,647
If Jong Kook wins this time too,

1488
00:55:09,647 --> 00:55:11,377
it means Kwang Soo and Jae Seok...

1489
00:55:11,377 --> 00:55:12,677
can never beat Jong Kook.

1490
00:55:12,677 --> 00:55:14,107
- I can never beat him. - Never.

1491
00:55:14,107 --> 00:55:15,807
If Kwang Soo loses...

1492
00:55:15,807 --> 00:55:17,907
I've made up my mind.

1493
00:55:17,907 --> 00:55:19,407
- I'll definitely win. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1494
00:55:19,407 --> 00:55:22,907
(Jong Kook has taken everything away from me.)

1495
00:55:23,347 --> 00:55:29,277
(I'll get back at him today.)

1496
00:55:29,777 --> 00:55:30,847
Rock-paper-scissors.

1497
00:55:31,377 --> 00:55:32,377
(It's a tie.)

1498
00:55:33,877 --> 00:55:36,647
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1499
00:55:36,677 --> 00:55:38,947
(Kwang Soo loses.)

1500
00:55:39,777 --> 00:55:41,477
(I see.)

1501
00:55:41,477 --> 00:55:46,007
(It was only a dream.)

1502
00:55:46,407 --> 00:55:48,447
You should have just lost early.

1503
00:55:48,807 --> 00:55:51,077
How embarrassing is this?

1504
00:55:51,677 --> 00:55:52,747
I'll have jjamppong.

1505
00:55:52,747 --> 00:55:55,807
Jjamppong? Okay. Jong Kook will have jjamppong.

1506
00:55:55,807 --> 00:55:59,007
It only did Jong Kook good.

1507
00:55:59,007 --> 00:56:00,877
- Great. - Jong Kook is unbelievable.

1508
00:56:00,877 --> 00:56:02,907
Kwang Soo can never win.

1509
00:56:02,907 --> 00:56:04,677
- It's unbelievable. - It is.

1510
00:56:04,677 --> 00:56:05,877
What are you doing?

1511
00:56:06,077 --> 00:56:07,307
(What are you doing?)

1512
00:56:07,307 --> 00:56:08,677
It seems like...

1513
00:56:08,677 --> 00:56:10,147
- you're getting tired of it. - What are you doing?

1514
00:56:10,147 --> 00:56:11,947
I am.

1515
00:56:11,947 --> 00:56:13,947
If he can't finish it, he has to pay five dollars.

1516
00:56:13,947 --> 00:56:15,807
- That's absurd. - You shouldn't waste food.

1517
00:56:15,807 --> 00:56:17,677
- You didn't say that. - You shouldn't throw away food.

1518
00:56:17,677 --> 00:56:18,747
- You have to pay five dollars. - Don't be absurd.

1519
00:56:18,747 --> 00:56:19,847
Who are you to decide?

1520
00:56:19,847 --> 00:56:22,107
(Don't be absurd. Who are you to decide?)

1521
00:56:22,607 --> 00:56:24,407
He has to pay five dollars if he doesn't finish it.

1522
00:56:24,777 --> 00:56:25,907
Seriously.

1523
00:56:25,907 --> 00:56:27,107
It's unacceptable.

1524
00:56:27,107 --> 00:56:28,907
You usually have to pay 10 dollars.

1525
00:56:29,407 --> 00:56:30,777
That's not okay.

1526
00:56:30,777 --> 00:56:31,777
(He donates his Tangsuyuk to the staff.)

1527
00:56:31,777 --> 00:56:33,547
You can't do that.

1528
00:56:33,707 --> 00:56:35,407
- He couldn't resist. - Why not?

1529
00:56:35,507 --> 00:56:37,647
(He couldn't resist.)

1530
00:56:37,907 --> 00:56:38,947
You should have resisted.

1531
00:56:38,947 --> 00:56:41,747
- Not many could resist that. - I know.

1532
00:56:42,307 --> 00:56:44,177
You should resist.

1533
00:56:46,007 --> 00:56:48,477
(He opens his mouth.)

1534
00:56:49,377 --> 00:56:51,507
(I want to eat it.)

1535
00:56:51,507 --> 00:56:53,477
- Wait. - What are you doing?

1536
00:56:53,477 --> 00:56:54,507
I'm sorry.

1537
00:56:54,507 --> 00:56:55,847
He was testing you.

1538
00:56:56,407 --> 00:56:58,177
- I'm sorry. - Did you see that?

1539
00:56:59,377 --> 00:57:02,177
I'll have to find a way.

1540
00:57:03,307 --> 00:57:04,677
(Careful)

1541
00:57:04,677 --> 00:57:05,877
Isn't it a little weird?

1542
00:57:05,877 --> 00:57:07,207
Ji Hyo.

1543
00:57:07,207 --> 00:57:09,247
Can you lend me five dollars?

1544
00:57:10,907 --> 00:57:12,077
Lend me five dollars.

1545
00:57:12,307 --> 00:57:14,607
- Can we switch places? - Ji Hyo.

1546
00:57:14,607 --> 00:57:16,047
- Jae Seok keeps... - Jae Seok.

1547
00:57:16,047 --> 00:57:18,107
I can lend you some money. Give me three pieces of Tangsuyuk.

1548
00:57:18,307 --> 00:57:19,377
- Sure. - Just three pieces.

1549
00:57:19,377 --> 00:57:20,807
Okay. I'll go get it.

1550
00:57:20,807 --> 00:57:21,907
Five pieces.

1551
00:57:22,047 --> 00:57:23,877
Just 3. You said 3.

1552
00:57:23,877 --> 00:57:25,647
If you have five pieces, you'll get tired of it.

1553
00:57:25,647 --> 00:57:28,077
- 3 pieces for 3 dollars. - You said 5 dollars.

1554
00:57:28,407 --> 00:57:30,147
- 5 dollars. - All right. 3 pieces for 5 dollars.

1555
00:57:30,307 --> 00:57:31,977
It's too expensive.

1556
00:57:32,307 --> 00:57:33,707
Seok Jin.

1557
00:57:33,747 --> 00:57:35,647
Can I get three pieces for a dollar?

1558
00:57:35,647 --> 00:57:37,107
(Can I get 3 pieces for a dollar?)

1559
00:57:38,277 --> 00:57:39,907
(Wait.)

1560
00:57:40,847 --> 00:57:42,407
(3 pieces for a dollar)

1561
00:57:42,407 --> 00:57:44,577
- Sure. - Okay.

1562
00:57:44,577 --> 00:57:47,477
(My goodness.)

1563
00:57:47,477 --> 00:57:48,507
All right.

1564
00:57:48,647 --> 00:57:49,807
Give me the money first.

1565
00:57:49,807 --> 00:57:50,847
So Min, give me the money.

1566
00:57:51,747 --> 00:57:52,777
Right now.

1567
00:57:53,247 --> 00:57:55,007
Give it to me.

1568
00:57:55,007 --> 00:57:56,477
You promised me.

1569
00:57:56,477 --> 00:57:57,947
- Are you a broker? - Give it.

1570
00:57:57,947 --> 00:58:00,407
No, I'm not. I just made a deal.

1571
00:58:00,407 --> 00:58:01,977
Really?

1572
00:58:01,977 --> 00:58:03,647
Give it to me.

1573
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,907
You're taking a commission.

1574
00:58:04,907 --> 00:58:06,547
No, I'm not.

1575
00:58:06,877 --> 00:58:08,577
Are you taking 80 percent?

1576
00:58:08,707 --> 00:58:10,147
- She promised me. - Wait.

1577
00:58:10,147 --> 00:58:11,647
Is the fee 80 percent?

1578
00:58:11,647 --> 00:58:13,707
- I mean... - Give it to me.

1579
00:58:13,877 --> 00:58:15,307
You promised me.

1580
00:58:15,307 --> 00:58:16,307
What?

1581
00:58:16,877 --> 00:58:19,807
Give me three pieces. We made a deal.

1582
00:58:19,877 --> 00:58:21,377
You promised me.

1583
00:58:21,377 --> 00:58:25,477
This is why farmers have a hard time.

1584
00:58:25,907 --> 00:58:27,977
- Okay? - What?

1585
00:58:27,977 --> 00:58:30,307
So Min, give me your plate. I'll put the pieces on your plate.

1586
00:58:30,307 --> 00:58:32,707
- You... - Let me choose the pieces.

1587
00:58:32,707 --> 00:58:34,877
Let me choose the big ones.

1588
00:58:34,877 --> 00:58:36,677
I kept the promise.

1589
00:58:36,877 --> 00:58:38,147
He's taking so much money.

1590
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,347
Kwang Soo.

1591
00:58:40,647 --> 00:58:41,747
(Do you want a piece for five dollars?)

1592
00:58:41,747 --> 00:58:42,807
Kwang Soo.

1593
00:58:43,777 --> 00:58:44,807
What?

1594
00:58:45,307 --> 00:58:46,647
- What? - Hey.

1595
00:58:47,377 --> 00:58:48,377
What?

1596
00:58:48,607 --> 00:58:50,277
Do you think I'm stupid?

1597
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:52,747
(Do you think I'm stupid?)

1598
00:58:53,047 --> 00:58:55,707
I just saw everything.

1599
00:58:56,107 --> 00:58:59,147
Do you seriously think I'm stupid?

1600
00:58:59,147 --> 00:59:01,407
It'd be so funny if Kwang Soo buys it for 10 dollars.

1601
00:59:01,407 --> 00:59:02,407
What is it?

1602
00:59:02,907 --> 00:59:04,877
Two dollars.

1603
00:59:05,377 --> 00:59:06,807
- I'd buy it. - Hey.

1604
00:59:06,807 --> 00:59:09,047
I can buy 6 pieces for 2 dollars there.

1605
00:59:09,047 --> 00:59:11,177
(I can buy 6 pieces for 2 dollars there. )

1606
00:59:12,877 --> 00:59:15,147
There, I can get six.

1607
00:59:15,147 --> 00:59:16,877
Should I put them on sale?

1608
00:59:17,007 --> 00:59:18,577
You can get everything for a dollar.

1609
00:59:19,377 --> 00:59:21,647
I shouldn't use my money.

1610
00:59:21,647 --> 00:59:25,047
My situation is too good to use my money.

1611
00:59:25,047 --> 00:59:27,447
Kwang Soo is...

1612
00:59:27,577 --> 00:59:29,747
chasing Ji Hyo.

1613
00:59:30,477 --> 00:59:31,907
I had only 10 dollars, and I still ate it.

1614
00:59:31,907 --> 00:59:33,307
Just get it for a dollar.

1615
00:59:33,307 --> 00:59:34,977
I could do that.

1616
00:59:35,307 --> 00:59:37,377
Stop it. If you feel so hesitant, forget it.

1617
00:59:37,377 --> 00:59:38,747
Hey.

1618
00:59:38,747 --> 00:59:40,807
Let's play rock-paper-scissors and...

1619
00:59:40,807 --> 00:59:41,807
Okay.

1620
00:59:41,807 --> 00:59:43,147
(Whatever that is, I'm in.)

1621
00:59:43,277 --> 00:59:44,347
If I win, you have to pay two dollars.

1622
00:59:44,577 --> 00:59:45,607
If I lose, I'll give it to you for free.

1623
00:59:45,607 --> 00:59:48,047
(If Seok Jin loses, he'll give the food to Kwang Soo for free.)

1624
00:59:48,907 --> 00:59:50,277
- That sounds good. - If I win, you'll pay two dollars.

1625
00:59:50,277 --> 00:59:51,507
- It's worth a try. - If I lose, it's free.

1626
00:59:51,507 --> 00:59:53,047
- It's a nice deal. - It's for free.

1627
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:57,907
(If Kwang Soo wins, all the food will be his.)

1628
00:59:57,907 --> 01:00:05,007
(But if he loses, he'll fall behind in the competition.)

1629
01:00:05,007 --> 01:00:07,247
- Okay. - It'll be for free.

1630
01:00:07,407 --> 01:00:09,247
(How will this match end?)

1631
01:00:20,184 --> 01:00:22,190
If I win, you have to pay two dollars.

1632
01:00:22,215 --> 01:00:29,784
(If Seok Jin loses, Kwang Soo can have the food for free.)

1633
01:00:29,784 --> 01:00:30,817
It'll be for free.

1634
01:00:30,842 --> 01:00:31,777
Okay.

1635
01:00:32,005 --> 01:00:35,205
(How will this rock-paper-scissors end?)

1636
01:00:35,205 --> 01:00:36,875
(Kwang Soo loses.)

1637
01:00:37,205 --> 01:00:39,805
Good. Give me two dollars.

1638
01:00:39,805 --> 01:00:42,845
(No words are needed.)

1639
01:00:42,845 --> 01:00:44,805
All right.

1640
01:00:45,005 --> 01:00:47,045
You should have said yes to a dollar.

1641
01:00:47,045 --> 01:00:48,375
You could have bought it for a dollar.

1642
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:50,305
Why would you pay two dollars?

1643
01:00:50,305 --> 01:00:52,045
Seok Jin usually doesn't show paper.

1644
01:00:52,045 --> 01:00:53,045
I know.

1645
01:00:53,205 --> 01:00:55,405
- Why didn't you show scissors? - Kwang Soo showed rock.

1646
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:58,175
I made some money with my Tangsuyuk.

1647
01:00:58,175 --> 01:01:00,945
2, 4, 6, 7...

1648
01:01:00,945 --> 01:01:02,005
I have 17 dollars.

1649
01:01:02,645 --> 01:01:04,345
I earned five dollars.

1650
01:01:05,105 --> 01:01:06,945
You could have bought nine pieces for a dollar.

1651
01:01:06,945 --> 01:01:08,005
You got 6 pieces for 2 dollars.

1652
01:01:08,005 --> 01:01:09,275
It tastes good.

1653
01:01:09,275 --> 01:01:11,205
It does.

1654
01:01:11,375 --> 01:01:14,605
(What is So Min doing?)

1655
01:01:17,375 --> 01:01:18,375
So Min.

1656
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:19,545
(Laughing)

1657
01:01:19,545 --> 01:01:21,205
Why are you eating cucumbers?

1658
01:01:21,205 --> 01:01:23,705
Kwang Soo said I could.

1659
01:01:24,275 --> 01:01:27,405
(Kwang Soo is like that.)

1660
01:01:27,745 --> 01:01:29,205
Can I have the cucumbers?

1661
01:01:29,375 --> 01:01:30,375
Sure.

1662
01:01:30,675 --> 01:01:32,975
(He's so kind.)

1663
01:01:33,205 --> 01:01:34,275
(So Min will never starve.)

1664
01:01:34,275 --> 01:01:35,345
So Min is...

1665
01:01:35,845 --> 01:01:37,605
- She's strong. - She's so strong.

1666
01:01:37,605 --> 01:01:39,345
You're so strong.

1667
01:01:40,175 --> 01:01:41,905
She's eating smiling.

1668
01:01:41,905 --> 01:01:44,075
- She let you stay at her place. - She paid the driver too.

1669
01:01:44,305 --> 01:01:45,975
Give a couple of pieces to her.

1670
01:01:46,105 --> 01:01:47,605
I gave her the cucumbers.

1671
01:01:47,605 --> 01:01:49,405
(What more should I give?)

1672
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:50,405
(They're friendly as always.)

1673
01:01:50,405 --> 01:01:51,945
How can you do that?

1674
01:01:51,945 --> 01:01:53,305
There's not much left.

1675
01:01:53,845 --> 01:01:56,305
- It tastes so good. - I was going to...

1676
01:01:56,305 --> 01:01:59,705
(Ji Hyo: 63 dollars, 2 Badges Kwang Soo: 32 dollars, 2 Badges)

1677
01:02:01,405 --> 01:02:04,105
We'll move to another mission spot.

1678
01:02:04,105 --> 01:02:05,905
I think it'll be our last mission.

1679
01:02:05,905 --> 01:02:08,005
This will determine the result.

1680
01:02:08,005 --> 01:02:09,205
I hope it'll be the last one.

1681
01:02:09,205 --> 01:02:10,905
- Let's do this. - We'll...

1682
01:02:10,905 --> 01:02:12,205
give you the last chance.

1683
01:02:12,205 --> 01:02:13,405
Okay.

1684
01:02:13,545 --> 01:02:16,145
If you succeed,

1685
01:02:16,205 --> 01:02:18,445
you can win as much as the amount you bet.

1686
01:02:18,475 --> 01:02:19,645
Again?

1687
01:02:19,905 --> 01:02:21,745
We'll play...

1688
01:02:22,005 --> 01:02:23,305
Jae Seok's Game.

1689
01:02:23,305 --> 01:02:24,705
(Bonus Mission 2: Jae Seok's Game)

1690
01:02:24,705 --> 01:02:25,705
- What? - What about Seok Jin's Game?

1691
01:02:25,705 --> 01:02:29,105
You have to say an irrelevant answer to 3 consecutive questions.

1692
01:02:29,105 --> 01:02:35,305
(You have to say an irrelevant answer to 3 consecutive questions.)

1693
01:02:35,305 --> 01:02:37,005
- Wait. - Has the name changed?

1694
01:02:37,005 --> 01:02:39,505
- I love it. - Wasn't that Seok Jin's Game?

1695
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:41,105
That's Seok Jin's Game.

1696
01:02:41,105 --> 01:02:42,705
Did you change the name?

1697
01:02:42,705 --> 01:02:44,405
Is it the same game with a different name?

1698
01:02:44,405 --> 01:02:45,645
Is this called Jae Seok's Game?

1699
01:02:45,645 --> 01:02:48,275
They're relaunching the game.

1700
01:02:48,275 --> 01:02:50,475
- The changed their sign. - Did they change the sign?

1701
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:52,745
They're opening the store again.

1702
01:02:52,805 --> 01:02:54,305
I love it.

1703
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:57,045
Let's start from Se Chan.

1704
01:02:57,045 --> 01:02:58,045
How much will you bet?

1705
01:02:58,045 --> 01:02:59,775
I have only 10 dollars.

1706
01:02:59,775 --> 01:03:01,105
- Bet 10 dollars. - Bet just a dollar.

1707
01:03:01,105 --> 01:03:02,375
- I couldn't bet just a dollar. - Bet 10 dollars.

1708
01:03:02,375 --> 01:03:04,605
Hey, be a man.

1709
01:03:04,605 --> 01:03:06,105
5 dollars? I shouldn't bet 10 dollars.

1710
01:03:06,105 --> 01:03:07,475
I bet five dollars.

1711
01:03:07,475 --> 01:03:08,675
- Okay. - You're a man.

1712
01:03:08,675 --> 01:03:09,905
Here we go.

1713
01:03:09,905 --> 01:03:10,905
Let's go.

1714
01:03:10,905 --> 01:03:12,805
(What result will his manly betting bring?)

1715
01:03:12,805 --> 01:03:14,375
Ready, start.

1716
01:03:14,375 --> 01:03:16,045
- What's your girlfriend's weakness? - An air conditioner.

1717
01:03:16,205 --> 01:03:17,375
What makes you saddest?

1718
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:18,375
Song Ji Hyo.

1719
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:21,145
(What makes you saddest? Song Ji Hyo.)

1720
01:03:22,375 --> 01:03:24,545
- Do you have a crush on her? - Song Ji Hyo.

1721
01:03:24,545 --> 01:03:27,205
(I had to confess my feelings this way.)

1722
01:03:27,205 --> 01:03:28,375
What about her?

1723
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:29,605
Did I...

1724
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:31,475
- make you sad? - Did she make you sad?

1725
01:03:31,705 --> 01:03:32,945
Could it be because...

1726
01:03:32,945 --> 01:03:36,805
Ji Hyo's dream guy is Seok Jin?

1727
01:03:38,005 --> 01:03:40,205
- I see. - That's not true!

1728
01:03:40,205 --> 01:03:41,275
- Ji Hyo. - That's not true!

1729
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:43,205
- I'm sorry I'm married. - Stop it.

1730
01:03:43,205 --> 01:03:44,405
I'm sorry I'm married.

1731
01:03:44,405 --> 01:03:46,775
I was thinking of Ji Hyo.

1732
01:03:47,105 --> 01:03:48,105
Too bad.

1733
01:03:48,105 --> 01:03:50,505
(Se Chan fails.)

1734
01:03:51,805 --> 01:03:53,205
- Next... - Two dollars.

1735
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:54,775
- So Min, bet just 2 dollars. - 2 dollars.

1736
01:03:54,775 --> 01:03:56,005
- 2 dollars. - All right.

1737
01:03:56,105 --> 01:03:57,105
Ready.

1738
01:03:57,975 --> 01:03:59,045
Start.

1739
01:03:59,045 --> 01:04:00,545
What would you like to say to Kwang Soo's father?

1740
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:01,605
Don't walk, run.

1741
01:04:01,605 --> 01:04:04,305
(Don't walk, run.)

1742
01:04:04,305 --> 01:04:05,445
Don't walk, run.

1743
01:04:06,205 --> 01:04:08,105
- Hey. - What?

1744
01:04:08,105 --> 01:04:09,545
"Don't walk, run?"

1745
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:11,875
How can she say that to my father?

1746
01:04:11,875 --> 01:04:13,045
Please run, sir.

1747
01:04:13,045 --> 01:04:14,805
He's old.

1748
01:04:14,805 --> 01:04:16,175
- "Don't walk, run?" - I mean...

1749
01:04:16,175 --> 01:04:17,375
I mean...

1750
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:19,045
He just turned 60.

1751
01:04:19,045 --> 01:04:20,675
I'm sorry.

1752
01:04:20,675 --> 01:04:22,045
I'm sorry.

1753
01:04:22,045 --> 01:04:23,405
- You can walk. - Sir.

1754
01:04:23,405 --> 01:04:25,305
So Min wants you to run, not walk.

1755
01:04:25,305 --> 01:04:26,405
- I'm sorry. - How am I supposed to take it?

1756
01:04:26,405 --> 01:04:27,405
Here's two dollars.

1757
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:28,405
Kwang Soo.

1758
01:04:29,105 --> 01:04:30,575
Kwang Soo, bet 30 dollars.

1759
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:32,545
You should bet 30 dollars and place 1st.

1760
01:04:32,545 --> 01:04:33,675
Everything else is meaningless.

1761
01:04:33,675 --> 01:04:34,975
You need to place first. How much money do you have?

1762
01:04:35,005 --> 01:04:36,545
I have 55 dollars.

1763
01:04:36,545 --> 01:04:37,645
Ji Hyo has 55 dollars.

1764
01:04:37,645 --> 01:04:39,205
If you bet 30 dollars, you can place 1st with 60 dollars.

1765
01:04:39,205 --> 01:04:40,475
It won't be easy.

1766
01:04:40,475 --> 01:04:42,605
- I will bet 25 dollars. - 25 dollars is a good amount.

1767
01:04:42,605 --> 01:04:44,045
- Wait a minute. - Really?

1768
01:04:44,175 --> 01:04:45,675
- Okay! - Then Se Chan will place last.

1769
01:04:45,675 --> 01:04:48,075
- I will do it! - He will do it.

1770
01:04:48,075 --> 01:04:49,505
- This is a big game. - I'll take the challenge.

1771
01:04:49,505 --> 01:04:51,505
- All right. - I am betting 25 dollars.

1772
01:04:51,505 --> 01:04:53,345
That's a good choice.

1773
01:04:53,345 --> 01:04:57,505
(Kwang Soo overexerted himself to take Ji Hyo down.)

1774
01:04:57,845 --> 01:04:59,205
Let's begin.

1775
01:04:59,205 --> 01:05:00,305
Ready.

1776
01:05:00,305 --> 01:05:01,505
Set, go.

1777
01:05:01,505 --> 01:05:03,645
- What was your conception dream? - 3 times 7.

1778
01:05:03,645 --> 01:05:04,945
What do you want to have the most these days?

1779
01:05:04,945 --> 01:05:06,075
Cucumber kimchi.

1780
01:05:06,075 --> 01:05:10,205
(Cucumber kimchi)

1781
01:05:10,545 --> 01:05:12,005
What do you want to have the most these days?

1782
01:05:12,005 --> 01:05:13,075
Cucumber kimchi.

1783
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:14,405
(Cucumber kimchi)

1784
01:05:14,405 --> 01:05:15,545
That's a small wish.

1785
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:17,375
Did you want cucumber kimchi?

1786
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:18,545
(Kwang Soo dreams of having kimchi.)

1787
01:05:18,545 --> 01:05:19,905
It can't be helped.

1788
01:05:20,205 --> 01:05:22,205
He will lose 25 dollars.

1789
01:05:22,345 --> 01:05:23,705
Why did you say that?

1790
01:05:23,705 --> 01:05:25,005
Why did you say that?

1791
01:05:25,175 --> 01:05:27,545
I will buy you kimchi.

1792
01:05:27,545 --> 01:05:28,775
(Kwang Soo fails to acquire money.)

1793
01:05:29,405 --> 01:05:30,975
The last chance is over.

1794
01:05:30,975 --> 01:05:32,905
We will move to the next location.

1795
01:05:34,175 --> 01:05:36,705
I fell asleep and leaned to this side.

1796
01:05:37,575 --> 01:05:39,145
Please hit me once.

1797
01:05:39,145 --> 01:05:40,245
- Where? - The head.

1798
01:05:40,445 --> 01:05:41,675
You are tired, right?

1799
01:05:41,975 --> 01:05:43,045
(Hitting)

1800
01:05:44,305 --> 01:05:46,775
- You shouldn't have hit so hard. - You need to wake up.

1801
01:05:48,205 --> 01:05:49,505
It hurts.

1802
01:05:50,245 --> 01:05:52,245
- What are you doing? - I asked him to hit me once.

1803
01:05:52,245 --> 01:05:54,045
Are you trying to simulate a relationship?

1804
01:05:54,045 --> 01:05:56,675
Don't force it. We are not interested.

1805
01:05:56,775 --> 01:05:57,945
It's not like that.

1806
01:05:57,945 --> 01:05:59,705
- It's not like that between us. - They are so annoying.

1807
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:02,075
- Don't force it. - Stop it already.

1808
01:06:02,075 --> 01:06:03,105
It's not like that.

1809
01:06:03,105 --> 01:06:04,575
Gosh, So Min is ridiculous.

1810
01:06:04,575 --> 01:06:07,205
I hate it, too. I won't do it.

1811
01:06:07,205 --> 01:06:08,645
I don't want it.

1812
01:06:08,645 --> 01:06:10,145
Do you want it? I don't want it.

1813
01:06:10,145 --> 01:06:11,275
(She is upset.)

1814
01:06:12,175 --> 01:06:14,405
Why are you making a fuss?

1815
01:06:14,405 --> 01:06:15,875
What are you doing?

1816
01:06:16,675 --> 01:06:19,505
- I don't want to see them. - It's not like that.

1817
01:06:19,645 --> 01:06:22,005
Ji Hyo, I bet you want to simulate a relationship with me. I am sorry.

1818
01:06:22,675 --> 01:06:25,475
I am sorry. I won't be able to do it since I am married.

1819
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:26,905
I won't be able to do it.

1820
01:06:26,905 --> 01:06:28,875
- That's not true. - I am sorry.

1821
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:30,375
(Will this be his first on-screen relationship?)

1822
01:06:30,905 --> 01:06:32,405
We are at a coin karaoke.

1823
01:06:32,545 --> 01:06:34,345
- It's a coin karaoke. - A coin karaoke.

1824
01:06:34,345 --> 01:06:35,475
- It's nice. - It's a coin karaoke.

1825
01:06:35,475 --> 01:06:38,605
- This is fascinating. - There are numbers.

1826
01:06:38,605 --> 01:06:41,345
It looks like we have to choose a room.

1827
01:06:41,775 --> 01:06:44,205
- They set up the rooms. - Really?

1828
01:06:44,205 --> 01:06:45,705
(What kind of discordance will they have here?)

1829
01:06:45,705 --> 01:06:48,445
Your next mission is What Will You Sing?

1830
01:06:48,445 --> 01:06:50,645
(What Will You Sing?)

1831
01:06:50,645 --> 01:06:51,745
(What Will You Sing?)

1832
01:06:51,745 --> 01:06:52,845
What Will You Sing?

1833
01:06:53,505 --> 01:06:55,105
Your next mission is What Will You Sing?

1834
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:57,875
When we give you a singer, choose and sing...

1835
01:06:57,875 --> 01:06:59,845
a song of theirs.

1836
01:07:00,005 --> 01:07:02,845
The mission is a success if all members sing different songs.

1837
01:07:04,105 --> 01:07:05,945
- One singer will be given. - One singer will be given.

1838
01:07:06,045 --> 01:07:09,205
- Do we fail if the songs overlap? - Yes. The rules are the same.

1839
01:07:09,245 --> 01:07:10,345
In essence,

1840
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:11,875
those who know a lot...

1841
01:07:11,875 --> 01:07:13,445
- of the songs have an advantage. - Right.

1842
01:07:13,445 --> 01:07:15,575
Those people should sing difficult songs.

1843
01:07:15,575 --> 01:07:16,745
- Okay. - Okay.

1844
01:07:18,245 --> 01:07:19,545
I'll go in room eight.

1845
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:21,375
I am at a coin karaoke.

1846
01:07:21,605 --> 01:07:23,375
- Which song should I sing? - This is nice.

1847
01:07:24,545 --> 01:07:26,405
Before we start the game,

1848
01:07:27,075 --> 01:07:29,045
- we will play a warm-up game. - Okay.

1849
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:33,045
When I tell you to start, begin playing the quick wit game.

1850
01:07:33,045 --> 01:07:34,475
(The quick wit game)

1851
01:07:34,475 --> 01:07:35,545
Does everyone know how to play?

1852
01:07:35,545 --> 01:07:36,645
- Yes. - Yes.

1853
01:07:37,075 --> 01:07:39,545
Open the door and shout your name when the game starts.

1854
01:07:39,675 --> 01:07:41,545
Get ready.

1855
01:07:41,645 --> 01:07:42,805
(They get ready.)

1856
01:07:42,805 --> 01:07:43,875
Get ready.

1857
01:07:44,215 --> 01:07:48,975
(They can neither go together or be the last one remaining.)

1858
01:07:49,175 --> 01:07:51,045
Set, go.

1859
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:52,275
- Song Ji Hyo. - Lee Kwang Soo.

1860
01:07:52,275 --> 01:07:53,975
(Song Ji Hyo, Lee Kwang Soo, Jeon So Min)

1861
01:07:55,445 --> 01:07:59,215
(Kwang Soo, Ji Hyo, and So Min fail from the start.)

1862
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:00,505
(They are in sync in a situation like this.)

1863
01:08:00,505 --> 01:08:02,075
The three of them failed.

1864
01:08:02,675 --> 01:08:04,745
- I knew they would get caught. - That was amazing.

1865
01:08:04,745 --> 01:08:06,605
- Did they get caught? - Pay up three dollars each.

1866
01:08:06,605 --> 01:08:07,875
- Three dollars. - What?

1867
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:09,875
So Min, Kwang Soo, and Ji Hyo must pay up three dollars.

1868
01:08:10,305 --> 01:08:12,045
- They make a great team. - They are hilarious.

1869
01:08:12,045 --> 01:08:13,975
- They make a great team. - That was hilarious.

1870
01:08:14,075 --> 01:08:15,775
What happened to me?

1871
01:08:17,005 --> 01:08:18,375
We will play the game one more time.

1872
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:20,675
If you miss the timing and become the last one remaining,

1873
01:08:20,675 --> 01:08:22,275
- you will need to pay five dollars. - Five dollars?

1874
01:08:22,275 --> 01:08:23,275
(The last one remaining will need to pay 5 dollars.)

1875
01:08:23,775 --> 01:08:25,075
I will be the first one to go.

1876
01:08:25,175 --> 01:08:26,805
I will go first no matter what.

1877
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:28,775
I told you, I am going to go first.

1878
01:08:28,775 --> 01:08:30,105
I will go first.

1879
01:08:30,905 --> 01:08:33,105
My door is already open. You can see it, right?

1880
01:08:33,105 --> 01:08:35,105
You know that I keep my words.

1881
01:08:35,105 --> 01:08:37,175
- I am a moth. - I will go first.

1882
01:08:37,245 --> 01:08:38,475
I have nothing to lose.

1883
01:08:39,005 --> 01:08:40,545
Seok Jin, did you understand the game?

1884
01:08:41,475 --> 01:08:42,505
(Seok Jin is quiet in his room.)

1885
01:08:42,505 --> 01:08:44,945
Seok Jin, did you understand the rules?

1886
01:08:45,775 --> 01:08:47,405
Are you sure you understood the rules?

1887
01:08:47,805 --> 01:08:49,805
- Should we tell him one more time? - Hey.

1888
01:08:49,805 --> 01:08:51,245
- Maybe he is sleeping. - Hold on.

1889
01:08:51,245 --> 01:08:52,575
- Is he alive? - Seok Jin!

1890
01:08:52,575 --> 01:08:53,805
(Wait a minute.)

1891
01:08:54,715 --> 01:08:56,875
I almost put a finger under his nose.

1892
01:08:56,875 --> 01:08:58,775
Watch him carefully.

1893
01:08:59,445 --> 01:09:00,605
I know what I am doing.

1894
01:09:00,715 --> 01:09:02,505
Promise us that you will move every five minutes.

1895
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:03,715
(Do that just in case.)

1896
01:09:04,245 --> 01:09:05,475
This time,

1897
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:08,275
we will include Accordance Badges too.

1898
01:09:08,275 --> 01:09:10,405
- What? - Accordance Badges are involved.

1899
01:09:10,405 --> 01:09:12,305
(It's an intense, warm-up game.)

1900
01:09:12,305 --> 01:09:13,675
This is bad.

1901
01:09:14,745 --> 01:09:16,745
(Relaxed)

1902
01:09:16,745 --> 01:09:17,845
Haven't you played this game before?

1903
01:09:18,105 --> 01:09:19,675
I have never gotten caught.

1904
01:09:19,675 --> 01:09:20,945
They can't hold out until the end.

1905
01:09:20,945 --> 01:09:22,175
(He speaks from experience.)

1906
01:09:22,175 --> 01:09:23,245
They're not patient enough.

1907
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:29,245
(Let's come out in our room's order without telling Seok Jin.)

1908
01:09:30,245 --> 01:09:34,775
(The 7 members will end the game without telling Seok Jin.)

1909
01:09:36,045 --> 01:09:40,545
(Seok Jin will pay a fine of 5 dollars.)

1910
01:09:41,075 --> 01:09:42,245
Okay.

1911
01:09:42,245 --> 01:09:44,475
(They carry out their plan without Seok Jin.)

1912
01:09:45,605 --> 01:09:47,875
(I have never gotten caught.)

1913
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:49,105
Get ready.

1914
01:09:49,105 --> 01:09:50,145
(They get ready.)

1915
01:09:50,215 --> 01:09:51,305
Get ready.

1916
01:09:51,305 --> 01:09:54,575
(Are you ready?)

1917
01:09:54,845 --> 01:09:57,245
Set, go.

1918
01:09:57,245 --> 01:09:58,645
- Yu Jae Seok. - Jeon So Min.

1919
01:09:58,645 --> 01:09:59,845
- Song Ji Hyo. - Haha.

1920
01:09:59,975 --> 01:10:01,545
- Kim Jong Kook. - Lee Kwang Soo.

1921
01:10:01,545 --> 01:10:02,575
Yang Se Chan.

1922
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:06,375
Set, go.

1923
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:07,475
Yu Jae Seok.

1924
01:10:07,475 --> 01:10:12,275
(Wait... What?)

1925
01:10:13,805 --> 01:10:15,245
What happened?

1926
01:10:16,505 --> 01:10:18,175
(Seok Jin gets the penalty.)

1927
01:10:18,175 --> 01:10:19,175
That was perfect.

1928
01:10:19,175 --> 01:10:20,215
You planned it, didn't you?

1929
01:10:20,215 --> 01:10:21,745
We did it.

1930
01:10:21,745 --> 01:10:23,405
He got the penalty.

1931
01:10:23,405 --> 01:10:26,215
- 5 dollars! - 5 dollars!

1932
01:10:26,215 --> 01:10:28,105
- You planned it, didn't you? - Five dollars!

1933
01:10:28,105 --> 01:10:32,045
(We have never had such a fun, warm-up game.)

1934
01:10:32,545 --> 01:10:33,715
Give me five dollars.

1935
01:10:33,775 --> 01:10:35,245
- You didn't come out. - It seems like you planned it.

1936
01:10:35,245 --> 01:10:36,715
You got the penalty because you didn't participate.

1937
01:10:36,715 --> 01:10:38,045
(Seok Jin is completely fooled.)

1938
01:10:38,045 --> 01:10:39,745
Now, let's get the mission started.

1939
01:10:39,745 --> 01:10:40,805
- Okay. - Okay.

1940
01:10:40,805 --> 01:10:44,345
The artist whose songs you must choose from...

1941
01:10:45,005 --> 01:10:46,105
is Kim Jong Kook.

1942
01:10:46,105 --> 01:10:48,045
(Kim Jong Kook)

1943
01:10:48,045 --> 01:10:50,845
(They must pick a song by Turbo or Kim Jong Kook.)

1944
01:10:51,805 --> 01:10:55,105
(He debuted as a member of Turbo in 1995 and swept the nation.)

1945
01:10:55,105 --> 01:11:01,805
(As a solo artist, he won awards in all 3 broadcasting stations.)

1946
01:11:02,575 --> 01:11:05,045
(That's right. Jong Kook is a singer.)

1947
01:11:05,715 --> 01:11:07,375
I know a lot of his songs.

1948
01:11:07,715 --> 01:11:09,445
"One Man", "Reminiscence",

1949
01:11:09,715 --> 01:11:11,805
"At the Ski Resort", "Twist King",

1950
01:11:11,905 --> 01:11:13,105
and "Black Cat".

1951
01:11:14,715 --> 01:11:17,245
Let's see... Jong Kook's songs?

1952
01:11:17,245 --> 01:11:21,405
(They need to choose songs that won't overlap.)

1953
01:11:21,745 --> 01:11:23,575
I need to choose a song no one else would sing.

1954
01:11:24,215 --> 01:11:25,305
Please.

1955
01:11:25,305 --> 01:11:28,475
(The mission will be over if they all choose different songs.)

1956
01:11:31,175 --> 01:11:32,475
Should I sing, "Some Jazz Bar"?

1957
01:11:34,645 --> 01:11:39,715
(It used to be the top 1 song men sang at karaokes.)

1958
01:11:39,715 --> 01:11:40,845
That's the song, right?

1959
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:42,715
Did someone choose this song?

1960
01:11:44,045 --> 01:11:46,445
I have many options.

1961
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:49,575
I only need to choose a song people don't know.

1962
01:11:49,575 --> 01:11:50,605
(He is best-suited for this mission.)

1963
01:11:51,175 --> 01:11:53,505
"Men Are All Like That", "Because I Am a Man"...

1964
01:11:54,975 --> 01:11:56,215
What should I sing?

1965
01:11:56,215 --> 01:11:57,245
(Please don't let the choices overlap.)

1966
01:11:58,075 --> 01:12:00,475
Please write down the title of the song.

1967
01:12:01,105 --> 01:12:04,005
(Everyone has chosen a song.)

1968
01:12:04,005 --> 01:12:05,175
Now,

1969
01:12:05,875 --> 01:12:07,745
press the start button.

1970
01:12:08,805 --> 01:12:12,845
(Music, play)

1971
01:12:18,975 --> 01:12:21,715
("Black Cat" is a song from the 1st album...)

1972
01:12:21,715 --> 01:12:25,105
(with a cheerful beat and cute dance.)

1973
01:12:25,505 --> 01:12:29,505
(When you become sulky)

1974
01:12:29,505 --> 01:12:33,545
(He has no sense of rhythm.)

1975
01:12:33,715 --> 01:12:34,975
(Meanwhile, So Min)

1976
01:12:34,975 --> 01:12:36,215
It has been a while since I sang this song.

1977
01:12:38,645 --> 01:12:40,645
(She is getting ready to dance.)

1978
01:12:40,645 --> 01:12:42,805
(Her good cheer explodes.)

1979
01:12:44,245 --> 01:12:46,645
("Twist King" is a hit song from Turbo's 2nd album...)

1980
01:12:46,645 --> 01:12:48,805
(that made everyone in Korea do the twist.)

1981
01:12:48,905 --> 01:12:51,175
(Shake it.)

1982
01:12:54,575 --> 01:12:56,245
("Choice")

1983
01:12:56,245 --> 01:12:57,375
Turbo.

1984
01:12:57,745 --> 01:12:59,575
"Choice".

1985
01:13:00,575 --> 01:13:03,075
("Choice" is a song from Turbo's 1st album...)

1986
01:13:03,075 --> 01:13:07,215
(that has a stylish beat and sorrowful lyrics.)

1987
01:13:08,145 --> 01:13:11,775
(He lowered the pitch by 5 octaves.)

1988
01:13:15,745 --> 01:13:18,715
(He channels Kim Jong Kook.)

1989
01:13:20,175 --> 01:13:22,875
(A reggae mosquito from Jamaica appears.)

1990
01:13:24,715 --> 01:13:28,005
(He enters the realm of dolphins.)

1991
01:13:30,875 --> 01:13:33,905
(Meanwhile, Kim Jong Kook, the real singer, sings a song.)

1992
01:13:38,215 --> 01:13:41,145
("Don't Be Good to Me" is a song from Kim Jong Kook's 6th album...)

1993
01:13:41,145 --> 01:13:44,275
(about the sorrow of one-sided love...)

1994
01:13:44,275 --> 01:13:47,375
(that made men's hearts ache.)

1995
01:13:48,545 --> 01:13:51,805
(Absorbed)

1996
01:13:53,305 --> 01:13:56,045
(That's right. This muscular man...)

1997
01:13:56,045 --> 01:13:58,905
(was the king of singers...)

1998
01:13:58,905 --> 01:14:01,775
(before he became the king of removing name tags.)

1999
01:14:04,475 --> 01:14:10,605
(So far, the 4 members chose different songs.)

2000
01:14:11,215 --> 01:14:16,075
(Will there be discordance among them?)

2001
01:14:16,075 --> 01:14:19,445
Number one, Jae Seok, please open the door and sing.

2002
01:14:19,445 --> 01:14:21,005
(Jae Seok reveals his song.)

2003
01:14:21,005 --> 01:14:24,375
(Which song did Jae Seok choose?)

2004
01:14:25,075 --> 01:14:28,045
I won't be sad.

2005
01:14:28,045 --> 01:14:30,605
("Some Jazz Bar")

2006
01:14:31,715 --> 01:14:33,745
(5 people have been discordant so far.)

2007
01:14:34,275 --> 01:14:37,775
(So Min chose "Twist King" by Turbo.)

2008
01:14:38,715 --> 01:14:41,775
(What song did Ji Hyo choose?)

2009
01:14:46,345 --> 01:14:49,805
("This Is the Person" by Kim Jong Kook)

2010
01:14:51,075 --> 01:14:57,445
(They all chose different songs.)

2011
01:14:58,375 --> 01:15:01,245
(6 people have been discordant so far.)

2012
01:15:01,545 --> 01:15:03,845
(Haha chose "Choice" by Turbo.)

2013
01:15:04,405 --> 01:15:07,245
(He sings in a high octave.)

2014
01:15:08,505 --> 01:15:10,875
Nobody's the same.

2015
01:15:10,875 --> 01:15:13,215
This might work.

2016
01:15:13,215 --> 01:15:14,275
(They are all hopeful.)

2017
01:15:14,275 --> 01:15:16,745
(He's the biggest obstacle to their success.)

2018
01:15:18,145 --> 01:15:21,405
(What song did Seok Jin choose?)

2019
01:15:23,215 --> 01:15:25,505
("Men Are All Like That" by Kim Jong Kook)

2020
01:15:26,545 --> 01:15:29,845
(They all chose different songs.)

2021
01:15:29,845 --> 01:15:31,005
Next.

2022
01:15:31,275 --> 01:15:33,775
Next. Who's number six?

2023
01:15:33,775 --> 01:15:36,845
(7 people have succeeded so far. Who's left?)

2024
01:15:36,845 --> 01:15:39,345
(It's the unlucky Kwang Soo.)

2025
01:15:41,145 --> 01:15:42,975
(If Kwang Soo chose a new song...)

2026
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:44,345
Nobody else chose "Some Jazz Bar" so far.

2027
01:15:44,345 --> 01:15:46,145
(If Kwang Soo chose a new song, they are all discordant.)

2028
01:15:47,575 --> 01:15:49,675
(Unfortunately, their fates...)

2029
01:15:49,675 --> 01:15:53,275
(are up to Kwang Soo.)

2030
01:15:54,805 --> 01:15:58,745
(What song did he choose?)

2031
01:16:01,745 --> 01:16:02,905
What?

2032
01:16:03,145 --> 01:16:06,715
("Some Jazz Bar")

2033
01:16:08,045 --> 01:16:09,645
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo are concordant with each other.)

2034
01:16:09,645 --> 01:16:11,005
Did you choose "Some Jazz Bar"?

2035
01:16:11,805 --> 01:16:13,105
(They are the Unlucky Duo.)

2036
01:16:13,105 --> 01:16:14,245
Jae Seok.

2037
01:16:14,575 --> 01:16:16,545
Why would you choose this song?

2038
01:16:17,275 --> 01:16:19,215
Why did you choose "Some Jazz Bar"?

2039
01:16:19,215 --> 01:16:20,845
It's my favourite song.

2040
01:16:22,775 --> 01:16:25,005
("Some Jazz Bar"...)

2041
01:16:25,005 --> 01:16:29,275
(by the Unlucky Duo.)

2042
01:16:31,605 --> 01:16:35,905
(You betrayed me back then. How are you doing?)

2043
01:16:37,575 --> 01:16:39,775
Why did you choose "Some Jazz Bar"?

2044
01:16:39,775 --> 01:16:41,575
It's personally my...

2045
01:16:41,775 --> 01:16:43,245
- Jae Seok. - Gosh.

2046
01:16:44,245 --> 01:16:47,775
Since Kwang Soo and Jae Seok are concordant with each other,

2047
01:16:48,175 --> 01:16:51,745
Jae Seok now has 11 Accordance Badges.

2048
01:16:53,445 --> 01:16:56,275
- This is done. - So the mission ends now.

2049
01:16:56,275 --> 01:16:58,715
Kwang Soo paid two dollars as penalty,

2050
01:16:58,845 --> 01:17:01,775
so last place switched from Se Chan to Kwang Soo.

2051
01:17:01,775 --> 01:17:03,845
(After paying the penalty, Kwang Soo comes in last.)

2052
01:17:03,845 --> 01:17:06,145
(The tables are turned.)

2053
01:17:06,145 --> 01:17:07,375
- Really? - How much is it?

2054
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:08,905
- How much is it? - Really?

2055
01:17:08,905 --> 01:17:10,975
- This is the person - This is the person.

2056
01:17:10,975 --> 01:17:15,075
- You're in last place - You're in last place.

2057
01:17:15,075 --> 01:17:16,175
- How much do you have? - You can't switch.

2058
01:17:16,175 --> 01:17:17,245
I have two dollars.

2059
01:17:17,245 --> 01:17:18,745
I have three dollars.

2060
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:20,475
(It's a dollar's miracle.)

2061
01:17:20,475 --> 01:17:21,745
You fool.

2062
01:17:21,745 --> 01:17:25,075
This is the person, you're in last place.

2063
01:17:25,075 --> 01:17:26,545
- That was close. - So today's Discordance Race...

2064
01:17:26,545 --> 01:17:28,175
ends now.

2065
01:17:28,175 --> 01:17:30,075
The winner is Ji Hyo with 50 dollars.

2066
01:17:30,875 --> 01:17:32,945
- That's awesome. - The last place is Kwang Soo...

2067
01:17:32,945 --> 01:17:34,145
with two dollars.

2068
01:17:35,045 --> 01:17:38,045
(It's a new project on Running Man.)

2069
01:17:38,045 --> 01:17:39,715
(People's Recommendation Project:)

2070
01:17:39,715 --> 01:17:44,275
(A Place for 1 Percent)

2071
01:17:44,275 --> 01:17:48,845
(Once you receive 3 I Go Stickers, you must leave.)

2072
01:17:49,605 --> 01:17:50,645
(People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent)

2073
01:17:50,645 --> 01:17:52,215
(So far, Haha and So Min have 1 each.)

2074
01:17:52,375 --> 01:17:54,605
(And today, another I Go Sticker will be given out.)

2075
01:17:54,605 --> 01:17:56,675
Ji Hyo, please put the stickers on.

2076
01:17:56,675 --> 01:17:57,975
I'll do that.

2077
01:17:58,075 --> 01:17:59,775
Are you going in order?

2078
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:01,505
That looks good. I have a chance.

2079
01:18:01,505 --> 01:18:03,405
- Can you give me 5, not 4? - That's for Se Chan.

2080
01:18:03,405 --> 01:18:05,145
- I'm 6. - Kwang Soo is 6 again.

2081
01:18:05,145 --> 01:18:07,445
(She assigns everybody a number.)

2082
01:18:07,445 --> 01:18:11,445
(There are Jae Seok and So Min left. What would Ji Hyo do?)

2083
01:18:13,405 --> 01:18:17,545
(She saves So Min.)

2084
01:18:17,975 --> 01:18:19,275
I left out So Min.

2085
01:18:19,275 --> 01:18:20,345
- Thank you. - She already has...

2086
01:18:20,345 --> 01:18:21,575
- an I Go Sticker. - Ji Hyo.

2087
01:18:21,575 --> 01:18:24,275
Why don't you try throwing the dice before you stick these on?

2088
01:18:24,275 --> 01:18:25,345
Let's just do it.

2089
01:18:25,345 --> 01:18:27,075
- Yes, let's just do it. - Just let it go.

2090
01:18:27,075 --> 01:18:28,305
- It won't be number 1. - I don't want to be number 5.

2091
01:18:28,305 --> 01:18:29,605
I don't want to be number four.

2092
01:18:30,245 --> 01:18:31,605
Are you one, Jae Seok?

2093
01:18:32,775 --> 01:18:34,945
(Haha has an I Go Sticker already.)

2094
01:18:35,645 --> 01:18:37,245
- Let's go. - Roll it.

2095
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:38,715
- Start. - Roll it.

2096
01:18:38,715 --> 01:18:39,845
- Roll it, Ji Hyo. - Please.

2097
01:18:39,845 --> 01:18:41,275
- Start. - Okay.

2098
01:18:41,275 --> 01:18:42,375
(Ji Hyo rolls the dice.)

2099
01:18:43,545 --> 01:18:45,275
(She throws it up.)

2100
01:18:45,845 --> 01:18:52,805
(Who will get an I Go Sticker?)

2101
01:18:57,305 --> 01:18:59,405
(In a moment)

2102
01:18:59,405 --> 01:19:01,675
(These ladies catch the members' attention...)

2103
01:19:01,675 --> 01:19:04,575
(with their unbelievable skills.)

2104
01:19:04,775 --> 01:19:06,345
- Start. - Okay.

2105
01:19:06,345 --> 01:19:10,045
(An I Go Sticker will be given to the person with the number.)

2106
01:19:11,005 --> 01:19:13,675
(People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent)

2107
01:19:17,975 --> 01:19:18,975
- Number four. - Yes.

2108
01:19:18,975 --> 01:19:20,375
- It's Seok Jin. - It's Seok Jin!

2109
01:19:24,175 --> 01:19:25,245
- Number four. - Yes.

2110
01:19:25,245 --> 01:19:26,405
- It's Seok Jin. - It's Seok Jin!

2111
01:19:26,405 --> 01:19:28,645
(Seok Jin is chosen.)

2112
01:19:28,905 --> 01:19:31,075
- Seok Jin is her ideal type of men. - He is.

2113
01:19:31,075 --> 01:19:33,905
(Ji Hyo gives an I Go Sticker to Seok Jin.)

2114
01:19:33,905 --> 01:19:36,675
- He's her ideal type. - I love you, Seok Jin.

2115
01:19:36,875 --> 01:19:38,675
- Good. - I love you.

2116
01:19:38,675 --> 01:19:41,215
(I'm sorry for giving you a Sticker. I love you.)

2117
01:19:41,215 --> 01:19:42,775
He's her ideal type.

2118
01:19:42,775 --> 01:19:44,305
- Seok Jin. - That was a twist.

2119
01:19:44,305 --> 01:19:48,345
(A week later)

2120
01:19:48,345 --> 01:19:49,405
- Hello. - Hello.

2121
01:19:49,405 --> 01:19:50,745
- Hello. - Hello.

2122
01:19:51,005 --> 01:19:53,715
Here we are.

2123
01:19:54,375 --> 01:19:56,105
- How many years has it been? - We're back.

2124
01:19:56,105 --> 01:19:57,745
It feels like we're on a trip.

2125
01:19:57,845 --> 01:19:59,645
It feels like summer when we come here.

2126
01:19:59,645 --> 01:20:01,645
We have a staff member of this water park here.

2127
01:20:01,645 --> 01:20:02,805
Hello.

2128
01:20:03,105 --> 01:20:05,105
Here he goes again.

2129
01:20:05,105 --> 01:20:06,245
- Shouldn't he be... - Excuse me.

2130
01:20:06,245 --> 01:20:07,405
In a safari with these clothes on?

2131
01:20:07,405 --> 01:20:08,875
- Nice to meet you. - Why am I from here?

2132
01:20:08,875 --> 01:20:09,875
Aren't you a zoo keeper?

2133
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:11,475
What do you mean?

2134
01:20:11,475 --> 01:20:14,275
- He works in the safari. - Gosh.

2135
01:20:14,345 --> 01:20:15,845
- Seriously? From the start? - He takes care of rhinoceroses.

2136
01:20:15,845 --> 01:20:17,905
Are you doing this as soon as we start?

2137
01:20:18,875 --> 01:20:20,505
It's going to be my turn soon.

2138
01:20:20,975 --> 01:20:22,605
Is this a bit too much?

2139
01:20:22,605 --> 01:20:24,145
(I have good fashion sense.)

2140
01:20:24,675 --> 01:20:27,575
How could they talk about fashion?

2141
01:20:27,575 --> 01:20:29,775
You were easy on Kwang Soo.

2142
01:20:30,005 --> 01:20:32,075
- Turn around, Kwang Soo. - Excuse me.

2143
01:20:32,075 --> 01:20:35,305
He's just a step before we reach you.

2144
01:20:35,305 --> 01:20:36,545
Is that right?

2145
01:20:36,545 --> 01:20:39,005
- I'm headed towards you. - You're the final destination.

2146
01:20:39,675 --> 01:20:41,575
- Is it my turn? - Are you at a sauna?

2147
01:20:41,745 --> 01:20:45,245
Excuse me for asking,

2148
01:20:45,245 --> 01:20:46,745
but you took care of your pet here, right?

2149
01:20:46,745 --> 01:20:48,105
- Me? - Don't say yes.

2150
01:20:48,375 --> 01:20:49,805
Don't say yes.

2151
01:20:49,805 --> 01:20:51,445
Don't say yes.

2152
01:20:51,445 --> 01:20:52,715
Isn't that it?

2153
01:20:53,505 --> 01:20:55,605
Hand.

2154
01:20:56,805 --> 01:20:58,245
- Good job. - It suits you.

2155
01:20:58,405 --> 01:21:00,075
- I'll give you a snack in a bit. - Nice.

2156
01:21:00,945 --> 01:21:02,375
- Excuse me. - Yes?

2157
01:21:02,545 --> 01:21:03,975
Why aren't you pointing him out?

2158
01:21:04,075 --> 01:21:06,445
- Wait. - Do you think he'll get hurt?

2159
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:08,275
- I'm sorry... - He tried to dress up.

2160
01:21:08,275 --> 01:21:11,075
He's just a tourist here.

2161
01:21:11,375 --> 01:21:14,045
He's a local.

2162
01:21:14,275 --> 01:21:16,105
No, you should ask the ladies when they get here.

2163
01:21:16,105 --> 01:21:17,275
I dressed...

2164
01:21:17,275 --> 01:21:19,645
the best here.

2165
01:21:19,645 --> 01:21:21,145
- Hey. - Are you serious?

2166
01:21:21,145 --> 01:21:24,075
This is the best swimmer's fashion.

2167
01:21:24,675 --> 01:21:26,375
(Confidence completes one's fashion.)

2168
01:21:26,375 --> 01:21:27,975
Don't you like this colour, Jae Seok?

2169
01:21:27,975 --> 01:21:29,445
It's pretty awesome.

2170
01:21:29,805 --> 01:21:31,845
I thought he was my shadow.

2171
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:34,945
(He thought Jong Kook was his shadow.)

2172
01:21:34,945 --> 01:21:36,345
- Look at your backside. - What's wrong?

2173
01:21:36,345 --> 01:21:37,675
- This is normal of me. - You wear...

2174
01:21:37,675 --> 01:21:38,805
black too much.

2175
01:21:38,805 --> 01:21:41,005
- You look like a watermelon seed. - Really?

2176
01:21:41,075 --> 01:21:42,715
All right.

2177
01:21:42,975 --> 01:21:44,545
That's done.

2178
01:21:45,545 --> 01:21:47,445
We started with the zoo keeper.

2179
01:21:47,445 --> 01:21:49,345
We have a lot more to come,

2180
01:21:49,345 --> 01:21:51,545
so we can't waste more time on clothes.

2181
01:21:52,905 --> 01:21:55,745
People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent.

2182
01:21:55,745 --> 01:21:57,975
It's Number One Couple Race.

2183
01:21:57,975 --> 01:22:00,715
(Number 1 Couple Race)

2184
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:02,605
It's Number One Couple Race.

2185
01:22:02,605 --> 01:22:03,945
- Really? - It's a couple race.

2186
01:22:03,945 --> 01:22:05,605
I had a feeling.

2187
01:22:05,605 --> 01:22:08,175
It's usually a couple race when So Min and Ji Hyo are not here.

2188
01:22:08,175 --> 01:22:09,645
It's been a while.

2189
01:22:09,905 --> 01:22:11,845
Before you meet the ladies,

2190
01:22:11,845 --> 01:22:15,305
I'll invite a special, male guest.

2191
01:22:15,345 --> 01:22:16,575
Hello.

2192
01:22:16,575 --> 01:22:19,445
(Who is it?)

2193
01:22:19,445 --> 01:22:21,105
(He's tall and handsome.)

2194
01:22:21,105 --> 01:22:22,805
It's Actor Lee Tae Hwan.

2195
01:22:24,775 --> 01:22:29,445
(He's making his mark on dramas and variety shows.)

2196
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:31,715
(This audacious man is on Running Man.)

2197
01:22:31,715 --> 01:22:33,605
You have such wide shoulders.

2198
01:22:33,605 --> 01:22:35,305
I heard Tae Hwan is known for...

2199
01:22:35,305 --> 01:22:36,845
having broad, thug-like shoulders.

2200
01:22:37,345 --> 01:22:39,575
Whereas, Jong Kook is a real thug.

2201
01:22:39,975 --> 01:22:42,105
- He's just a gangster. - What are you saying?

2202
01:22:42,105 --> 01:22:43,575
- He's just... - I'm known for my shoulders too.

2203
01:22:43,575 --> 01:22:45,645
A normal gangster.

2204
01:22:46,175 --> 01:22:48,575
Tae Hwan is known for his shoulders.

2205
01:22:49,575 --> 01:22:51,975
- He has broad shoulders. - Let's welcome Tae Hwan.

2206
01:22:51,975 --> 01:22:54,175
(Lee Tae Hwan is here.)

2207
01:22:54,175 --> 01:22:55,745
It's a couple race,

2208
01:22:55,745 --> 01:22:59,675
so let's welcome the female guests who will be joining you today.

2209
01:22:59,675 --> 01:23:00,905
This feels so awkward.

2210
01:23:02,215 --> 01:23:04,945
(Are the ladies...)

2211
01:23:04,945 --> 01:23:07,845
(finally here?)

2212
01:23:07,845 --> 01:23:09,905
(Who will they be?)

2213
01:23:09,905 --> 01:23:12,445
First partner, please come on out.

2214
01:23:12,445 --> 01:23:16,005
(The first partner is revealed.)

2215
01:23:17,375 --> 01:23:21,375
(She doesn't hesitate.)

2216
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:23,905
(She loads her finger gun.)

2217
01:23:23,905 --> 01:23:25,645
All right.

2218
01:23:25,645 --> 01:23:27,005
Good. Come on.

2219
01:23:27,945 --> 01:23:31,745
(I'll capture you with my finger.)

2220
01:23:31,745 --> 01:23:33,775
(The owner of tempting fingers, Song Ji Hyo)

2221
01:23:36,215 --> 01:23:39,215
(She only needs a finger...)

2222
01:23:39,215 --> 01:23:40,675
(to make Jae Seok dance.)

2223
01:23:40,675 --> 01:23:42,715
Good job. I like this.

2224
01:23:42,715 --> 01:23:44,545
- Good one. - That was good.

2225
01:23:44,715 --> 01:23:47,275
This must be "A Dog of Flanders".

2226
01:23:48,445 --> 01:23:50,745
(Is it a girl and Patrasche?)

2227
01:23:50,745 --> 01:23:52,645
Come here, puppy.

2228
01:23:52,975 --> 01:23:56,215
We are joined by Ji Hyo.

2229
01:23:56,215 --> 01:23:59,405
Let's welcome the next person following Ji Hyo.

2230
01:23:59,575 --> 01:24:00,805
Please come on out.

2231
01:24:00,805 --> 01:24:02,545
(The second partner is revealed following Ji Hyo.)

2232
01:24:02,545 --> 01:24:05,215
(Who will it be this time?)

2233
01:24:06,345 --> 01:24:09,505
(She looks shy.)

2234
01:24:09,505 --> 01:24:12,845
(Who will it be?)

2235
01:24:13,605 --> 01:24:15,345
It's Koyote.

2236
01:24:15,975 --> 01:24:17,345
- It's So Min. - It's her.

2237
01:24:17,345 --> 01:24:19,845
(It's So Min, the lively mascot of Running Man.)

2238
01:24:19,845 --> 01:24:23,045
Here she comes.

2239
01:24:23,575 --> 01:24:24,945
She's here.

2240
01:24:25,775 --> 01:24:28,375
Our crazy lady is here.

2241
01:24:29,305 --> 01:24:30,545
The crazy lady...

2242
01:24:30,575 --> 01:24:31,575
is here.

2243
01:24:31,575 --> 01:24:32,645
Hello.

2244
01:24:32,775 --> 01:24:33,775
I'm afraid.

2245
01:24:33,775 --> 01:24:35,975
So Min and...

2246
01:24:35,975 --> 01:24:38,145
Ji Hyo look different today.

2247
01:24:38,275 --> 01:24:42,145
(How do we look?)

2248
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:46,075
During couple races, Ji Hyo...

2249
01:24:46,075 --> 01:24:48,405
puts a lot of makeup on her cheeks.

2250
01:24:48,405 --> 01:24:50,175
(Look at her.)

2251
01:24:51,145 --> 01:24:53,375
It looks good. It worked well.

2252
01:24:53,375 --> 01:24:55,245
- You're cute. - Your makeup looks good.

2253
01:24:55,245 --> 01:24:57,775
I heard Tae Hwan was joining us today.

2254
01:24:57,775 --> 01:24:59,845
- I even wore a hat. - Good job.

2255
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:01,245
(Nice to meet you, Ji Hyo.)

2256
01:25:01,475 --> 01:25:03,475
- So Min was saying earlier... - Come on out.

2257
01:25:03,475 --> 01:25:05,875
(Is there somebody new?)

2258
01:25:05,875 --> 01:25:07,045
It starts from here, right?

2259
01:25:07,045 --> 01:25:08,745
(The third partner is revealed.)

2260
01:25:08,745 --> 01:25:10,545
- She has long legs. Who is it? - She has long legs.

2261
01:25:11,575 --> 01:25:13,005
Who are those two?

2262
01:25:13,005 --> 01:25:14,405
(These two ladies have long hair and skinny bodies.)

2263
01:25:14,405 --> 01:25:16,545
I like the color of their clothes.

2264
01:25:16,775 --> 01:25:17,775
(Who are these mysterious ladies?)

2265
01:25:17,775 --> 01:25:19,145
- What? - Come here.

2266
01:25:19,145 --> 01:25:20,215
Are they back?

2267
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:23,745
(Who are these mysterious ladies?)

2268
01:25:23,775 --> 01:25:27,175
(It's Na Eun and Ha Young from Apink.)

2269
01:25:28,175 --> 01:25:30,945
(Here are the beautiful, idol stars.)

2270
01:25:30,945 --> 01:25:31,945
Yes.

2271
01:25:31,945 --> 01:25:34,375
(He's being so fussy.)

2272
01:25:35,675 --> 01:25:36,675
It's Apink.

2273
01:25:37,405 --> 01:25:40,845
(Their dance captures everybody's attention.)

2274
01:25:40,845 --> 01:25:45,775
(They'll steal the men's hearts.)

2275
01:25:46,745 --> 01:25:48,375
- Come here. - Come.

2276
01:25:48,375 --> 01:25:50,275
- Come here. - Come.

2277
01:25:50,275 --> 01:25:52,345
It's Apink's...

2278
01:25:52,345 --> 01:25:54,405
Ha Young and Na Eun.

2279
01:25:55,775 --> 01:25:57,505
This is insane. They're so pretty.

2280
01:25:57,505 --> 01:26:00,375
It's Apink's Ha Young...

2281
01:26:00,375 --> 01:26:02,505
and Na Eun. It's been a long time.

2282
01:26:02,505 --> 01:26:04,505
- Hello. - Hello.

2283
01:26:05,275 --> 01:26:07,605
Se Chan just whispered,

2284
01:26:08,405 --> 01:26:09,575
"She's mine."

2285
01:26:09,575 --> 01:26:12,305
(That's worth a laugh.)

2286
01:26:12,305 --> 01:26:13,645
- I'm not lying. - Hey.

2287
01:26:13,645 --> 01:26:14,845
Who is it? Who's yours, Se Chan?

2288
01:26:14,845 --> 01:26:16,305
- Say it. - Don't say that.

2289
01:26:16,305 --> 01:26:18,245
Don't do that.

2290
01:26:18,245 --> 01:26:19,715
I'm embarrassed.

2291
01:26:19,745 --> 01:26:21,545
- Who is it? - You look so happy.

2292
01:26:21,775 --> 01:26:23,345
They're so pretty.

2293
01:26:23,675 --> 01:26:25,075
All right, then.

2294
01:26:25,215 --> 01:26:26,805
Who's next?

2295
01:26:27,775 --> 01:26:29,375
(With her white shoes, she looks charismatic.)

2296
01:26:29,375 --> 01:26:30,975
- Look at her. - Look at her shoes.

2297
01:26:30,975 --> 01:26:32,405
Her shoes look very fierce.

2298
01:26:32,405 --> 01:26:34,005
They are.

2299
01:26:35,245 --> 01:26:36,245
(Who is the fifth lady...)

2300
01:26:36,245 --> 01:26:38,245
(who looks good in white shoes?)

2301
01:26:38,245 --> 01:26:40,045
Next person, please come on out.

2302
01:26:40,045 --> 01:26:41,045
Who is it?

2303
01:26:41,045 --> 01:26:42,375
(Who is she?)

2304
01:26:42,575 --> 01:26:43,875
That's me.

2305
01:26:43,875 --> 01:26:46,675
(Hey, boy)

2306
01:26:46,675 --> 01:26:50,475
(She causes a stir amongst the guys...)

2307
01:26:50,475 --> 01:26:55,075
(even before she appears.)

2308
01:26:55,845 --> 01:26:58,705
It's Lee Sun Bin.

2309
01:26:58,875 --> 01:27:00,045
(It's Lee Sun Bin.)

2310
01:27:00,505 --> 01:27:01,505
(She has hot looks and personality.)

2311
01:27:01,505 --> 01:27:04,245
Hello. Hello.

2312
01:27:05,875 --> 01:27:06,975
Increase the distance between your arms.

2313
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:11,645
(She set Kwang Soo's heart on fire the last time she was on.)

2314
01:27:12,145 --> 01:27:14,945
(How have you been, Kwang Soo?)

2315
01:27:14,945 --> 01:27:17,475
She has such pretty eyes.

2316
01:27:17,475 --> 01:27:18,475
Her eyes.

2317
01:27:18,475 --> 01:27:20,275
These are the best guests, right?

2318
01:27:20,675 --> 01:27:22,305
I love those colours.

2319
01:27:22,305 --> 01:27:23,305
(Today's guests are some of the best.)

2320
01:27:24,475 --> 01:27:27,105
We're all a mess except for Tae Hwan.

2321
01:27:27,105 --> 01:27:28,145
Aren't we a mess?

2322
01:27:28,675 --> 01:27:31,045
We'll talk to...

2323
01:27:31,045 --> 01:27:33,775
- Sun Bin shortly. - Sure.

2324
01:27:33,775 --> 01:27:36,975
She said she liked Kwang Soo, but when she saw him...

2325
01:27:37,145 --> 01:27:39,075
and got tested on the lie detector, it was proven to be a lie.

2326
01:27:39,075 --> 01:27:40,305
It was a lie.

2327
01:27:41,945 --> 01:27:43,975
(Their first meeting)

2328
01:27:43,975 --> 01:27:48,075
(My ideal type of man is truly Lee Kwang Soo.)

2329
01:27:48,075 --> 01:27:49,845
(She answered yes without hesitation.)

2330
01:27:50,375 --> 01:27:54,405
(Is she telling the truth or a lie?)

2331
01:27:54,405 --> 01:27:56,375
(It's a lie.)

2332
01:27:56,405 --> 01:27:57,405
On interviews...

2333
01:27:59,005 --> 01:28:00,845
(No, you're mistaken.)

2334
01:28:01,175 --> 01:28:03,845
(I tried resisting. It hurts.)

2335
01:28:05,305 --> 01:28:10,045
(Their first encounter was a painful memory to Kwang Soo.)

2336
01:28:12,105 --> 01:28:13,375
Did you use Kwang Soo?

2337
01:28:13,375 --> 01:28:14,775
- I didn't. - You didn't?

2338
01:28:14,775 --> 01:28:16,075
- I'm a woman of principles. - Really?

2339
01:28:16,075 --> 01:28:17,375
Since that day...

2340
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,245
And I'm not lying.

2341
01:28:19,245 --> 01:28:21,805
He couldn't sleep for two weeks because his heart was fluttering.

2342
01:28:21,845 --> 01:28:25,005
He told me on a serious note that he wanted to date somebody.

2343
01:28:25,005 --> 01:28:26,575
He said he wanted to be in love.

2344
01:28:26,575 --> 01:28:27,575
(Will they reunite today?)

2345
01:28:28,005 --> 01:28:30,375
Let's move on. There's another person.

2346
01:28:30,375 --> 01:28:32,245
There's another one? Why are there so many?

2347
01:28:32,245 --> 01:28:33,345
Why are there so many today?

2348
01:28:35,205 --> 01:28:36,245
Who is it?

2349
01:28:37,575 --> 01:28:40,775
(You can't help but be protective of her.)

2350
01:28:40,775 --> 01:28:42,645
(It's Son Yeo Eun who looks younger than her age.)

2351
01:28:43,645 --> 01:28:48,675
(She's a scene stealer on every drama she's in.)

2352
01:28:48,675 --> 01:28:52,275
(She's a great actress who can act as a protagonist and an antagonist.)

2353
01:28:54,105 --> 01:28:56,875
(Son Yeo Eun)

2354
01:28:56,905 --> 01:28:58,275
She's pretty.

2355
01:28:58,745 --> 01:29:00,175
She's Ha Eun's mom.

2356
01:29:00,175 --> 01:29:01,875
She's Ha Eun's mom.

2357
01:29:02,045 --> 01:29:03,975
She kind of looks like So Min.

2358
01:29:03,975 --> 01:29:06,575
- She does. - She looks like So Min.

2359
01:29:06,575 --> 01:29:07,645
This is my first time meeting you.

2360
01:29:07,645 --> 01:29:08,875
- Same here. - Right?

2361
01:29:08,875 --> 01:29:10,205
- You two look alike. - When I went...

2362
01:29:10,205 --> 01:29:13,005
somewhere, this person...

2363
01:29:13,005 --> 01:29:15,245
called me by your name.

2364
01:29:15,245 --> 01:29:17,405
- Really? - That's when I realized.

2365
01:29:17,405 --> 01:29:19,175
- Really? - She's much prettier than I am.

2366
01:29:19,175 --> 01:29:21,245
- No way. - They look alike...

2367
01:29:21,245 --> 01:29:22,505
because...

2368
01:29:22,505 --> 01:29:23,675
they're both pale.

2369
01:29:23,675 --> 01:29:25,945
(They look alike because they're both pale.)

2370
01:29:25,945 --> 01:29:28,675
They both have light skin.

2371
01:29:29,045 --> 01:29:30,945
What if she talks a lot too?

2372
01:29:31,275 --> 01:29:33,505
I've met Yeo Eun before on a different show.

2373
01:29:33,505 --> 01:29:35,145
- She's not easy. - She's not?

2374
01:29:35,145 --> 01:29:36,145
Right.

2375
01:29:36,145 --> 01:29:38,045
(Who follows Yeo Eun?)

2376
01:29:38,045 --> 01:29:39,405
Next...

2377
01:29:39,405 --> 01:29:41,405
Jong Kook's woman is here.

2378
01:29:41,405 --> 01:29:42,405
Really? Oh, dear.

2379
01:29:42,405 --> 01:29:44,675
- They dressed the same! - Who is it?

2380
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:49,375
- Jong Kook's woman is here today. - That's right.

2381
01:29:49,375 --> 01:29:51,405
He dressed like this for a reason.

2382
01:29:51,405 --> 01:29:52,405
I see.

2383
01:29:52,405 --> 01:29:53,405
Who's my woman?

2384
01:29:53,405 --> 01:29:55,045
You have one.

2385
01:29:55,045 --> 01:29:57,045
(Who's Jong Kook's woman with a similar fashion sense as him?)

2386
01:29:59,545 --> 01:30:01,975
("Ring Ring")

2387
01:30:01,975 --> 01:30:04,775
("Ring Ring"?)

2388
01:30:04,775 --> 01:30:06,205
(It's Hong Jin Young, the woman of trot music.)

2389
01:30:06,205 --> 01:30:07,205
It's Jin Young.

2390
01:30:07,645 --> 01:30:10,775
It's Hong Jin Young!

2391
01:30:10,775 --> 01:30:12,575
They're matching.

2392
01:30:12,575 --> 01:30:13,645
They're both wearing black.

2393
01:30:13,775 --> 01:30:16,045
That's too much.

2394
01:30:16,805 --> 01:30:18,375
My goodness.

2395
01:30:18,375 --> 01:30:20,075
Come here. Come to Jong Kook.

2396
01:30:20,075 --> 01:30:21,405
- It's okay. - Come to Jong Kook.

2397
01:30:21,405 --> 01:30:23,305
Hello.

2398
01:30:23,305 --> 01:30:25,705
It's been a long time.

2399
01:30:26,345 --> 01:30:27,845
It's been a long time.

2400
01:30:27,845 --> 01:30:29,375
- How have you been? - She's here.

2401
01:30:29,945 --> 01:30:30,945
Hello.

2402
01:30:30,945 --> 01:30:32,045
(It's Hong Jin Young, Jong Kook's woman.)

2403
01:30:32,045 --> 01:30:34,045
You've gained weight.

2404
01:30:34,045 --> 01:30:35,305
I had chicken feet last night before sleeping.

2405
01:30:35,305 --> 01:30:36,545
Is that right?

2406
01:30:36,945 --> 01:30:40,405
She looks like Ahn Moon Sook.

2407
01:30:40,405 --> 01:30:42,045
(Is she the friendly and easy-going Moon Sook?)

2408
01:30:42,045 --> 01:30:43,475
Who?

2409
01:30:43,745 --> 01:30:44,975
I agree.

2410
01:30:45,675 --> 01:30:47,175
No, Jin Young.

2411
01:30:47,175 --> 01:30:48,775
- He's wrong. - He's wrong.

2412
01:30:48,775 --> 01:30:50,675
- He means... - You should wear something else.

2413
01:30:50,675 --> 01:30:52,375
You look like a mature woman.

2414
01:30:52,375 --> 01:30:53,375
You look like a mature woman.

2415
01:30:53,375 --> 01:30:55,545
- That's what he means. - You look fine.

2416
01:30:55,775 --> 01:30:58,105
Jin Young is the last guest.

2417
01:30:58,105 --> 01:30:59,775
(The best guests are here today.)

2418
01:30:59,775 --> 01:31:01,275
It'll be fun.

2419
01:31:01,675 --> 01:31:05,245
Let's have a small talk with each of them.

2420
01:31:05,405 --> 01:31:07,275
As you may know,

2421
01:31:07,275 --> 01:31:09,575
- Na Eun is on Psy's "New Face". - "New Face".

2422
01:31:09,575 --> 01:31:11,105
She's the muse on it.

2423
01:31:11,105 --> 01:31:12,275
- That's right. - She's incredible.

2424
01:31:13,475 --> 01:31:17,075
("New Face" by Psy)

2425
01:31:17,075 --> 01:31:20,045
(Na Eun is the best of the best as an elegant lady.)

2426
01:31:20,575 --> 01:31:23,145
Can you show us "New Face"?

2427
01:31:23,145 --> 01:31:25,145
- Can you show it to us? - We need to see it.

2428
01:31:25,145 --> 01:31:27,205
- Look expressionless. - Let's see it.

2429
01:31:27,745 --> 01:31:28,745
Please come forward.

2430
01:31:28,745 --> 01:31:32,645
(She hesitates and takes a step forward.)

2431
01:31:32,645 --> 01:31:35,405
(She changes 180 degrees.)

2432
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:39,545
Here it is.

2433
01:31:40,045 --> 01:31:42,875
(Yes, I want some new face)

2434
01:31:42,875 --> 01:31:44,045
- New face - New face.

2435
01:31:44,045 --> 01:31:45,105
One more.

2436
01:31:46,775 --> 01:31:48,075
My goodness.

2437
01:31:48,675 --> 01:31:50,675
(It's a powerful dance from such a small lady.)

2438
01:31:50,675 --> 01:31:54,205
Good job.

2439
01:31:55,245 --> 01:31:57,205
She's good.

2440
01:31:57,205 --> 01:31:59,475
- She's good. - She's good.

2441
01:31:59,875 --> 01:32:02,175
Good job.

2442
01:32:02,175 --> 01:32:03,745
She's so charming.

2443
01:32:03,745 --> 01:32:04,845
She's not done.

2444
01:32:04,845 --> 01:32:06,575
- Good one. - Good.

2445
01:32:06,775 --> 01:32:08,175
- New face - Good job.

2446
01:32:08,275 --> 01:32:09,745
- Na Eun. - Good job.

2447
01:32:09,745 --> 01:32:11,245
- You're the best. - That's it.

2448
01:32:11,245 --> 01:32:12,745
(Watch out for Na Eun's irresistible charms.)

2449
01:32:12,745 --> 01:32:14,145
(She's ready to dominate Running Man.)

2450
01:32:14,145 --> 01:32:15,575
- Move. - Move.

2451
01:32:15,745 --> 01:32:17,205
- Move. - You move.

2452
01:32:17,305 --> 01:32:18,645
They're my glasses!

2453
01:32:18,645 --> 01:32:19,675
Na Eun.

2454
01:32:19,775 --> 01:32:20,875
Hey.

2455
01:32:22,306 --> 01:32:23,306
Move over.

2456
01:32:23,306 --> 01:32:25,336
She cares about Psy's song more than she does her own.

2457
01:32:25,606 --> 01:32:26,906
What are you going to do?

2458
01:32:27,176 --> 01:32:29,706
I do dance to it more than our own songs these days.

2459
01:32:29,706 --> 01:32:32,106
You're dancing too hard.

2460
01:32:32,436 --> 01:32:34,806
- That was powerful. - Your producer will be upset.

2461
01:32:34,806 --> 01:32:35,906
What are you doing?

2462
01:32:35,906 --> 01:32:38,306
- What's wrong with him? - You are not on her level.

2463
01:32:38,406 --> 01:32:39,436
- Avoid him. - I just...

2464
01:32:39,436 --> 01:32:41,176
wore these sunglasses. What's wrong?

2465
01:32:41,176 --> 01:32:44,136
- I'm sorry, - Ha Young is next.

2466
01:32:44,576 --> 01:32:46,276
But do you sell weapons?

2467
01:32:46,336 --> 01:32:48,836
(He's dressed like someone who secretly sells weapons.)

2468
01:32:49,806 --> 01:32:51,936
You look like someone from Cuba.

2469
01:32:51,936 --> 01:32:53,036
That was good.

2470
01:32:53,036 --> 01:32:55,336
- That was great. - You guys are too funny.

2471
01:32:55,336 --> 01:32:56,336
(Talent show is always fun.)

2472
01:32:56,336 --> 01:32:58,206
(Next week)

2473
01:32:58,776 --> 01:33:01,206
(This is not the end.)

2474
01:33:01,206 --> 01:33:03,206
(The ladies show their charms.)

2475
01:33:04,406 --> 01:33:06,036
(They cry...)

2476
01:33:06,036 --> 01:33:07,506
(and laugh.)

2477
01:33:07,506 --> 01:33:10,906
(These love stories take many turns.)

2478
01:33:12,506 --> 01:33:14,206
(And)

2479
01:33:14,576 --> 01:33:15,706
Hey.

2480
01:33:15,706 --> 01:33:18,436
(Is this her charm or a horror movie?)

2481
01:33:18,436 --> 01:33:20,876
(It's a transformation beyond your imagination.)

2482
01:33:20,876 --> 01:33:23,006
(It's a bloody race...)

2483
01:33:23,006 --> 01:33:26,776
(to avoid I Go Stickers.)

2484
01:33:28,406 --> 01:33:30,806
(Who will become...)

2485
01:33:30,806 --> 01:33:33,406
(Running Man's best partner?)

2486
01:33:34,306 --> 01:33:36,336
(Suspicious Partners, next Sunday)
