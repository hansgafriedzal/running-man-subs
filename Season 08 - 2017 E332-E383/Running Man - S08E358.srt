00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:07,538
(2017 Running Man's Second Global Project)

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,148
People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent.

3
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:16,348
(People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent)

4
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,108
(The member with 3 I Go Stickers will go to a place for 1 percent...)

5
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:24,978
(with a member they choose to go with.)

6
00:00:25,848 --> 00:00:29,608
(Their fates depend on the die that the victor throws.)

7
00:00:29,608 --> 00:00:30,978
(Haha and So Min received one Sticker each.)

8
00:00:31,878 --> 00:00:33,648
(As a result of the second race,)

9
00:00:33,648 --> 00:00:35,978
(Seok Jin received a Sticker.)

10
00:00:36,948 --> 00:00:41,178
(As a result of the third race, Suspicious Partner,)

11
00:00:41,178 --> 00:00:44,578
(Haha is in the lead with 2 I Go Stickers.)

12
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:49,148
(Will someone be selected for the trip today?)

13
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:51,631
- Hello. - Hi.

14
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:53,031
- What are we doing today? - Hello.

15
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:54,061
Hi.

16
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:55,661
- Hello. - Hi.

17
00:00:55,661 --> 00:00:57,891
(They start with the status report on I Go Stickers today again.)

18
00:00:58,508 --> 00:01:00,608
- Hello. - Haha is in trouble.

19
00:01:00,608 --> 00:01:01,908
- He is. - Good grief.

20
00:01:02,678 --> 00:01:04,508
Haha, if you get another Sticker, it's over.

21
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,408
I think Haha will go on that trip.

22
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,078
(If Haha gets 1 more Sticker, with 1 member, he will go on the trip.)

23
00:01:11,078 --> 00:01:12,078
Congratulations.

24
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:14,578
All right. Whom shall I take?

25
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,178
Who's going to join me?

26
00:01:16,178 --> 00:01:17,208
(Hugging)

27
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:18,508
It's Jae Seok.

28
00:01:18,508 --> 00:01:20,208
(Haha, I like you a lot.)

29
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:22,508
- You know I didn't say anything. - Goodness, look at you guys.

30
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:24,878
- They clapped, - Whom shall I take?

31
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:26,608
- but I didn't say anything. - All right.

32
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:27,708
Who wants to go with me?

33
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:29,508
- Don't give up hope until the end. - Thank you!

34
00:01:31,778 --> 00:01:33,038
Before we start the mission,

35
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:38,108
we will reveal a new recommendation from the viewers.

36
00:01:38,108 --> 00:01:39,408
We are still getting recommendations.

37
00:01:39,908 --> 00:01:41,508
We have a new travel destination.

38
00:01:42,608 --> 00:01:43,978
It's the place I will have to go.

39
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:48,908
(The 4 proposed places that were revealed the last time)

40
00:01:49,308 --> 00:01:51,378
(The mysterious underground ossuaries in the heart of Paris)

41
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:52,408
- Where is this place? - The ossuaries.

42
00:01:52,408 --> 00:01:53,878
My goodness.

43
00:01:54,978 --> 00:01:57,408
- It will be too scary. - That place has ghosts.

44
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,008
- They have real ghosts. - It's another scary place.

45
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:00,308
Are those bones?

46
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:04,208
- That's ridiculous. - Those are human bones.

47
00:02:05,308 --> 00:02:09,708
(A shocking collaboration between a valley and a cliff.)

48
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:10,938
Where is this place?

49
00:02:10,938 --> 00:02:12,408
That's a foreigner.

50
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:14,008
That's no joke.

51
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,238
My goodness.

52
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:17,838
I want to try it.

53
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:18,978
- Really? - What?

54
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:20,678
Do you want to try it?

55
00:02:22,238 --> 00:02:23,608
It's a swing.

56
00:02:23,608 --> 00:02:25,008
Look at that.

57
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:26,378
Why would anyone ride it?

58
00:02:26,378 --> 00:02:27,508
It will be impossible to go on it.

59
00:02:27,508 --> 00:02:28,878
Why would anyone ride it?

60
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:30,048
(It's the legendary swing even the architect rode only once.)

61
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:32,878
(The scary flight on the cliff, Giant Canyon Swing)

62
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:37,838
(If you find a diamond, it will be yours.)

63
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:40,138
- Let's go to this place. - I wouldn't mind this place.

64
00:02:40,138 --> 00:02:41,808
This place has diamonds.

65
00:02:41,808 --> 00:02:42,978
It will be nice to go there.

66
00:02:43,508 --> 00:02:45,908
(2 places were added)

67
00:02:46,108 --> 00:02:49,878
(Who knew such a charming activity existed in Indonesia?)

68
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,378
(You will be surprised when you go there.)

69
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:54,108
(There are hammocks between the peaks.)

70
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:55,208
Which activity is it?

71
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,308
What is that?

72
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:57,408
- Are those hammocks? - Hammocks?

73
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,808
No way!

74
00:03:00,808 --> 00:03:02,708
That's impossible.

75
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,138
I don't use hammocks on the ground because they are scary.

76
00:03:05,608 --> 00:03:08,508
(Try flying across the ocean!)

77
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:11,508
(I want Running Man to have this thrilling experience.)

78
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:12,938
This one involves the sea. This will be nice.

79
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:14,038
- What is this? - Look at those waves.

80
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:15,508
What is this?

81
00:03:16,478 --> 00:03:18,008
It's in Indonesia.

82
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:19,708
Don't people catch shrimp here?

83
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,408
(A cable car flies across the sea.)

84
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:24,708
- How is that possible? - I can do it.

85
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:27,008
(This small machine is the only way to brave the waves.)

86
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,478
It's manually run.

87
00:03:33,678 --> 00:03:37,108
Who gets the I Go Sticker is very important.

88
00:03:37,308 --> 00:03:38,508
From the start,

89
00:03:39,108 --> 00:03:41,738
- I will bet I Go Stickers. - That's fast.

90
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:44,008
People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent,

91
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:45,808
Defend the Stickers.

92
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,508
(Defend the Stickers)

93
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:51,308
I will first bid two I Go Stickers...

94
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:53,138
(2 I Go Stickers)

95
00:03:53,138 --> 00:03:55,308
- for the auction. - Two Stickers?

96
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:57,208
- This one will be important. - Two Stickers will end you.

97
00:03:57,408 --> 00:03:58,578
Two Stickers?

98
00:03:58,578 --> 00:03:59,778
(Two Stickers will be given at once.)

99
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:02,978
(Two Stickers can send Haha, Seok Jin, or So Min on a trip.)

100
00:04:02,978 --> 00:04:04,508
Wait a minute.

101
00:04:04,508 --> 00:04:08,208
It will be game over if So Min or I get two Stickers.

102
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,138
(I don't want to go on a trip.)

103
00:04:11,138 --> 00:04:13,878
- Can I distribute the Stickers? - Of course.

104
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,038
I see.

105
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:16,848
The person who gets the Stickers...

106
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:18,008
- can distribute them. - I see.

107
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,308
You can give them out after you win them.

108
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:20,738
(That's a relief.)

109
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:24,608
Inside the safe on the left are two I Go Stickers.

110
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:26,908
The person who wins the bid...

111
00:04:26,908 --> 00:04:29,308
can put two Stickers under anyone's name.

112
00:04:29,738 --> 00:04:30,738
We will have...

113
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:35,238
a blind auction with Slap the Forehead as the bids.

114
00:04:35,848 --> 00:04:40,508
(Slap the Forehead is the specialty of Running Man.)

115
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:45,678
The person with the highest number from 1 to 10 will win the bid.

116
00:04:45,978 --> 00:04:49,408
That person will get his forehead slapped...

117
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:52,138
by the bidder with the second highest number,

118
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,848
and take the two Stickers.

119
00:04:54,848 --> 00:04:57,678
Bidders with overlapping numbers...

120
00:04:57,678 --> 00:04:59,478
will be dropped out.

121
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:02,608
(Bidders with overlapping numbers will be dropped out.)

122
00:05:03,308 --> 00:05:05,608
- That's an important rule. - No overlapping numbers.

123
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,908
Moths,

124
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,108
you need to think carefully.

125
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:11,408
- I am warning you. - Don't be so extreme.

126
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:14,008
Our skulls might crack during the shoot.

127
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:16,378
(I don't want to get my forehead slapped by the 2nd highest bidder.)

128
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:18,408
(They begin to write down the number.)

129
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:19,708
If I win the bid, I won't have three I Go Stickers.

130
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,608
Are we allowed to give 2 Stickers to 1 person?

131
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:22,778
- Of course. - Oh, my goodness.

132
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:25,108
(The rookie moth, So Min, finishes writing down a number.)

133
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:26,408
Send me on a trip.

134
00:05:26,778 --> 00:05:27,978
I wrote down a number.

135
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:30,608
She is a moth.

136
00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:31,778
If you are done, please turn it in.

137
00:05:31,778 --> 00:05:33,508
- I knew which number to write. - Really?

138
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:36,108
- Did you write a number to win? - Me?

139
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:37,908
I don't know...

140
00:05:37,908 --> 00:05:40,038
- what she is thinking. - Can I give myself the Stickers?

141
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:41,778
Look at her.

142
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:42,878
(She turns in the number.)

143
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:46,678
She has ruined my plan so many times.

144
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:50,108
I am ready to have my skull cracked today.

145
00:05:50,108 --> 00:05:53,478
(I am ready to have my skull cracked today.)

146
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:56,108
Why would your skull crack?

147
00:05:56,308 --> 00:05:57,938
(Which number did So Min write down?)

148
00:05:57,938 --> 00:05:59,378
So Min, you scare me.

149
00:06:00,738 --> 00:06:01,838
I need to use my brain.

150
00:06:01,838 --> 00:06:03,008
I am so confused.

151
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:04,938
What should I do?

152
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:08,208
People may not write 10 down. I will write 10 down.

153
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,138
- Our numbers might overlap. - I will write 10 down.

154
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,508
- I will write it down as well. - I will write 10 down.

155
00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:16,738
(It looks like they will write 10 down.)

156
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:18,978
(In that case,)

157
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,508
(I will write 3 down.)

158
00:06:20,938 --> 00:06:23,608
Kwang Soo, I bet you will write three down.

159
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:25,808
(I have a feeling.)

160
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:28,838
It's not that small a number.

161
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:30,878
- I bet you will write three down. - It's not that small a number.

162
00:06:31,138 --> 00:06:33,878
(How did they know? I will erase it.)

163
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:35,708
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

164
00:06:36,778 --> 00:06:38,008
You erased three, right?

165
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:39,208
(You punk.)

166
00:06:39,878 --> 00:06:41,708
(No, I didn't.)

167
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,208
You need to think hard.

168
00:06:43,678 --> 00:06:44,808
(They write down numbers in a fierce war of nerves.)

169
00:06:44,808 --> 00:06:45,878
Okay.

170
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:48,708
I am done.

171
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:54,208
(Jae Seok finishes writing down a number.)

172
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:56,778
I didn't know Jae Seok would do that.

173
00:06:56,778 --> 00:06:57,808
(I saw his number.)

174
00:06:57,808 --> 00:06:58,908
Seriously.

175
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,678
(I hope my number doesn't overlap.)

176
00:07:01,678 --> 00:07:02,678
The future is uncertain.

177
00:07:03,408 --> 00:07:05,308
They say the scariest people have nothing to lose.

178
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:06,778
I became scary.

179
00:07:06,878 --> 00:07:10,378
(They turn in the numbers for Slap the Forehead.)

180
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:13,008
I will announce the result.

181
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,308
Is the result interesting?

182
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:17,008
- Yes, it is. - Really?

183
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,308
One was written by...

184
00:07:19,508 --> 00:07:21,508
- Did someone write down one? - No way.

185
00:07:21,738 --> 00:07:23,108
- Did someone write down one? - Really?

186
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,978
- Who did that? - Who wrote down one?

187
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,408
That's too much.

188
00:07:26,408 --> 00:07:28,038
(Did Kwang Soo write down 1 after erasing 3?)

189
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:29,208
For goodness' sake.

190
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,508
No one wrote it.

191
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:31,838
No one did that.

192
00:07:31,838 --> 00:07:33,108
We would have slapped the person who did it.

193
00:07:33,108 --> 00:07:35,378
- 3 was written by... - 3? Is it Kwang Soo?

194
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,208
It's not me.

195
00:07:38,778 --> 00:07:42,508
(People suspected Kwang Soo to write down 3.)

196
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:47,108
(Which number did he write after erasing 3?)

197
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:48,878
Three was written by...

198
00:07:48,878 --> 00:07:50,608
- Three? Is it Kwang Soo? - It's not me.

199
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:51,978
No one.

200
00:07:52,508 --> 00:07:53,738
You must have erased it.

201
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,808
All right.

202
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,378
- The bid of 4 slaps... - 4 slaps.

203
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:58,978
- The bid of four slaps was made... - Someone made the bid, right?

204
00:07:59,138 --> 00:08:00,138
Someone made the bid, right?

205
00:08:00,308 --> 00:08:02,678
- Did someone write down four? - The bid of four slaps was made...

206
00:08:02,678 --> 00:08:05,008
(Who made a bid of four slaps?)

207
00:08:05,008 --> 00:08:06,038
by Haha.

208
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:07,108
(Haha wrote 4.)

209
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:08,108
Come on.

210
00:08:08,308 --> 00:08:10,208
- Who said, "Come on"? - Haha.

211
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,838
- It was Seok Jin. - It wasn't me.

212
00:08:11,838 --> 00:08:13,108
(Surprised)

213
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:15,878
(If you mess with me, I will take you on the trip.)

214
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:17,678
Five was written by...

215
00:08:17,678 --> 00:08:19,678
(5 slaps)

216
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:20,808
Jae Seok and Ji Hyo.

217
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:22,308
For goodness' sake, Jae Seok.

218
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:23,878
Jae Seok and Ji Hyo.

219
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,408
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo are dropped out of the auction.)

220
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:27,308
Why did you do that?

221
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,008
I thought six would be the highest number.

222
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,978
Why did you do that?

223
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:38,208
(They fell into the trap of overlapping numbers.)

224
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,908
- Did you write down five? - Yes, I did.

225
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:41,738
For goodness' sake.

226
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:44,408
Six was written by...

227
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,808
- Seok Jin. - Yes!

228
00:08:47,808 --> 00:08:48,838
(My number didn't overlap.)

229
00:08:48,838 --> 00:08:49,838
I might win with six.

230
00:08:50,308 --> 00:08:51,808
If the higher numbers overlap, I will win.

231
00:08:51,878 --> 00:08:53,508
If the higher numbers overlap, I will win.

232
00:08:53,838 --> 00:08:55,908
I almost wrote six.

233
00:08:55,908 --> 00:08:56,978
I am glad I didn't do that.

234
00:08:56,978 --> 00:08:58,408
I didn't write six.

235
00:08:58,408 --> 00:08:59,608
It's possible to win with six.

236
00:08:59,608 --> 00:09:01,838
I will win if the higher numbers overlap.

237
00:09:01,838 --> 00:09:03,208
Seven was written by...

238
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,948
(Will Seok Jin's plans come true?)

239
00:09:05,948 --> 00:09:09,008
(The thing is,)

240
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:12,378
(Jong Kook wrote 7.)

241
00:09:12,378 --> 00:09:14,108
(If no one else wrote 7, Jong Kook will take the 1st place.)

242
00:09:14,108 --> 00:09:15,308
Seven was written by...

243
00:09:16,378 --> 00:09:17,908
Jong Kook.

244
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:19,778
- What? - Am I the only one who did that?

245
00:09:19,778 --> 00:09:21,308
Jong Kook.

246
00:09:21,308 --> 00:09:23,878
(Jong Kook takes the 1st place.)

247
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:25,008
Am I the only one who did that?

248
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:26,378
- Wait a minute. - Seok Jin is in second.

249
00:09:26,378 --> 00:09:27,478
Then I will get to slap him, right?

250
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:29,108
Me, Kwang Soo, and So Min remain.

251
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:30,978
- Jong Kook will slap hard. - That's right.

252
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:33,948
If their numbers overlap, Jong Kook will win.

253
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:36,208
Kwang Soo, did you write 10?

254
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,408
(There could be a winner among Kwang Soo, Se Chan, and So Min.)

255
00:09:38,408 --> 00:09:39,708
Eight was written by...

256
00:09:42,678 --> 00:09:44,208
Whoever gets slapped by me will die.

257
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:49,308
(Will Jong Kook win? Will there be a new winner?)

258
00:09:49,308 --> 00:09:51,708
Se Chan alone.

259
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:54,038
Wait a minute.

260
00:09:54,908 --> 00:09:57,978
(It's good to take the 1st place, but he will get slapped.)

261
00:09:57,978 --> 00:09:59,308
- Wait a minute. - Are you the only one?

262
00:10:00,008 --> 00:10:01,738
Who will slap me?

263
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:03,378
Jong Kook will.

264
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:06,708
I am going to die.

265
00:10:06,878 --> 00:10:07,948
I hope the numbers overlap.

266
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:09,008
Wait a minute, that would be bad.

267
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,208
I hope the numbers don't overlap.

268
00:10:11,008 --> 00:10:12,778
The remaining numbers are 9 and 10.

269
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:14,508
I hope the numbers don't overlap.

270
00:10:14,508 --> 00:10:16,138
(If the numbers overlap, Jong Kook will slap Se Chan.)

271
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:17,878
I hope someone wrote nine so that I can slap them.

272
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:19,508
The remaining members are So Min and Kwang Soo.

273
00:10:19,508 --> 00:10:20,878
The remaining numbers are 9 and 10.

274
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:22,578
(The remaining numbers are 9 and 10.)

275
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:23,838
Nine was written by...

276
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:25,608
Please.

277
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:27,508
Please don't let the numbers overlap.

278
00:10:27,508 --> 00:10:29,408
(Let me keep my skull in one piece.)

279
00:10:29,808 --> 00:10:31,708
Maybe someone else will take the 1st place.

280
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,678
(I want to massage Se Chan's forehead.)

281
00:10:33,678 --> 00:10:34,878
Nine was written by...

282
00:10:34,878 --> 00:10:36,478
(9 slaps)

283
00:10:36,478 --> 00:10:37,908
Kwang Soo and So Min.

284
00:10:37,908 --> 00:10:39,478
(Kwang Soo and So Min)

285
00:10:39,478 --> 00:10:42,478
(Kwang Soo and So Min are dropped out of the auction.)

286
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:44,408
You are the winner.

287
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:47,948
(Congratulations on winning the bid of death.)

288
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,978
The first place is Se Chan,

289
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:51,608
and the second place is Jong Kook. Congratulations.

290
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:53,008
My goodness, Se Chan.

291
00:10:53,008 --> 00:10:54,108
Congratulations.

292
00:10:54,378 --> 00:10:55,508
I am so excited.

293
00:10:55,508 --> 00:10:56,708
My goodness.

294
00:10:56,878 --> 00:10:58,878
- I am so excited. - I should have written eight.

295
00:10:59,808 --> 00:11:01,938
Se Chan, congratulations on winning the bid with eight slaps.

296
00:11:01,938 --> 00:11:03,378
Please take your eight slaps.

297
00:11:03,378 --> 00:11:06,938
(Se Chan exchanged his life for 2 I Go Stickers.)

298
00:11:07,938 --> 00:11:09,878
Se Chan, you will get the Stickers.

299
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:10,908
That's true.

300
00:11:10,978 --> 00:11:12,308
I don't mind going on a trip.

301
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:14,408
I like traveling abroad.

302
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:15,908
We can take the easy way.

303
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,208
I like traveling abroad. Give me the Stickers.

304
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,738
You can't negotiate with him.

305
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,778
You are so stubborn. Indeed.

306
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:24,078
- In every way, he's inflexible. - All right.

307
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:25,108
- He drives me crazy. - Sit down.

308
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:27,808
For your information, Jong Kook is the type...

309
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:30,978
to hit hard without making it funny.

310
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:34,508
(They were surprised by his powerful slap that was not funny at all.)

311
00:11:34,508 --> 00:11:35,508
It's going to hurt a lot.

312
00:11:35,538 --> 00:11:39,308
(They were surprised by his powerful slap that was not funny at all.)

313
00:11:39,438 --> 00:11:43,378
(Jong Kook tends to hit them in their eyes.)

314
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,908
(The game is about slapping one's forehead,)

315
00:11:46,908 --> 00:11:50,078
(but he likes to slap them in their eyes.)

316
00:11:50,178 --> 00:11:52,078
I'm the type that makes oneself in trouble.

317
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,838
(You understand me, right?)

318
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,438
He's the most annoying type.

319
00:11:57,978 --> 00:11:59,338
- All right. - Don't do that.

320
00:11:59,338 --> 00:12:01,578
Slap me lightly first so that I can grasp how it'll be.

321
00:12:01,578 --> 00:12:02,608
- Okay. - Lightly.

322
00:12:02,608 --> 00:12:03,708
I'll slap harder little by little.

323
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,908
(Slap)

324
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,508
(It's like there's an earthquake in his brain.)

325
00:12:10,808 --> 00:12:12,508
(It's just as I heard.)

326
00:12:12,508 --> 00:12:15,108
No, I didn't put much strength into it.

327
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:16,908
He's in pain, but it's not funny at all.

328
00:12:16,908 --> 00:12:18,978
What's going on? It's not funny at all.

329
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,208
- All of a sudden, - It's even boring.

330
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,408
I couldn't control my temper.

331
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,008
- Sit down already. - Goodness.

332
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:25,478
You got slapped only once.

333
00:12:25,638 --> 00:12:27,578
You won first place though.

334
00:12:27,578 --> 00:12:29,008
(Se Chan has 7 times more to be slapped left.)

335
00:12:29,008 --> 00:12:31,178
(Slap)

336
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:33,578
Jong Kook, hold on.

337
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,078
(Merciless)

338
00:12:36,308 --> 00:12:39,078
- It's just beating him up. - Hold on.

339
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:40,838
Make it interesting, will you?

340
00:12:40,838 --> 00:12:42,978
- What is going on? - He's really beating him up.

341
00:12:42,978 --> 00:12:44,108
This is too much.

342
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:46,178
- Remember it'll be aired. - My goodness.

343
00:12:46,608 --> 00:12:48,808
- He's committing violence. - This isn't right.

344
00:12:49,108 --> 00:12:51,378
- It's no joke. - He clenched his teeth.

345
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:54,838
(He's tearing up.)

346
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,578
- Come here. - He's crying.

347
00:12:56,578 --> 00:12:57,608
Hold on.

348
00:12:57,608 --> 00:12:58,738
Wait.

349
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:00,978
- Se Chan. - I just got slapped twice, right?

350
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:02,008
(I'm not this kind of person, but I can't stop crying.)

351
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:06,108
I'm telling you the truth that I didn't put my strength at all.

352
00:13:06,108 --> 00:13:08,738
If you're on Se Chan's side, you should take one slap for him.

353
00:13:08,738 --> 00:13:09,808
- Right. - Right.

354
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:12,538
If anyone gets slapped on behalf of me, I'll repay for their kindness.

355
00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:13,578
- Sure. - I'll take one.

356
00:13:13,578 --> 00:13:14,808
- I'll take one too. - I think I'm sick.

357
00:13:14,808 --> 00:13:17,108
- I'm dizzy now. - Guys, I'm the first in line.

358
00:13:17,108 --> 00:13:18,278
Give me one slap.

359
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:19,708
Tell me who'll go first so I can remember.

360
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:20,708
- Me! - I'll go first.

361
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,108
- I'm the first in line. - So Min, you too?

362
00:13:22,108 --> 00:13:23,538
- Yes. - So Min too?

363
00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:24,538
I can't slap a girl.

364
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:26,208
Please slap me.

365
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:29,178
Okay, that's the spirit, So Min.

366
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,378
(Please don't mind me and just slap.)

367
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:32,608
Take one slap.

368
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:35,278
Still, you're a girl. It's not right.

369
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:36,838
Then I'll slap her on behalf of you.

370
00:13:36,838 --> 00:13:39,438
(If you think it's not right, let me slap her.)

371
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:42,908
(What is he saying?)

372
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:44,338
I know you can't hit girls.

373
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:47,278
I'll slap her with my dirty hand.

374
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:49,638
- Let me slap her. - My hands are tainted already.

375
00:13:50,178 --> 00:13:51,208
- Yes. - Really?

376
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,278
- You have to think carefully. - Ji Hyo.

377
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:54,838
It'll hurt more than you think.

378
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,708
(How do I know? Because I took a slap like you,)

379
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,908
(and faced incredible pain before.)

380
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:04,438
I'll slap her.

381
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:06,208
So Min, you have to stay still.

382
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,808
- I won't slap hard. - She must not have seen...

383
00:14:07,808 --> 00:14:08,808
Ji Hyo get slapped then.

384
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:10,578
(Since you're my friend, I won't slap hard.)

385
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:15,438
(You mean it, right? I'll trust you.)

386
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:18,808
(Of course, So Min. Trust me.)

387
00:14:18,808 --> 00:14:19,908
(Slap)

388
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:21,008
Gosh, hey.

389
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,578
(High five)

390
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:24,608
(She's a fool to be deceived again.)

391
00:14:24,608 --> 00:14:26,008
- Goodness. - That was too hard.

392
00:14:26,178 --> 00:14:27,508
You slapped too hard.

393
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:29,578
- Goodness. - This isn't right.

394
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,608
This shouldn't be aired.

395
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,838
- Kwang Soo, how could you... - Look at her forehead.

396
00:14:34,838 --> 00:14:36,638
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?

397
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:39,278
- Magnet Lady, are you okay? - Are you okay?

398
00:14:40,108 --> 00:14:41,208
I'm sorry, So Min.

399
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,538
(He didn't know it'd be this hard.)

400
00:14:42,538 --> 00:14:43,738
That's not it.

401
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,638
- Hey, you. - Next, please come forward.

402
00:14:46,638 --> 00:14:48,308
- So Min. - Don't forget about me.

403
00:14:48,308 --> 00:14:49,708
- I won't. - Remember me.

404
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:52,608
It's the fourth slap now.

405
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:54,078
- So Min. - Let me slap him.

406
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:55,338
Sure, do that.

407
00:14:55,338 --> 00:14:58,808
(She's been waiting for his turn to come.)

408
00:14:59,008 --> 00:15:00,538
You have to slap him hard though.

409
00:15:00,538 --> 00:15:02,308
- You can't make her do that. - Slap him hard.

410
00:15:02,308 --> 00:15:03,908
- This isn't right. - With my palm, right?

411
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:06,008
(That's my girl, So Min.)

412
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:09,338
- Close your eyes. - It doesn't matter where she slaps.

413
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:10,708
(Slap)

414
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:11,808
Nice.

415
00:15:15,608 --> 00:15:19,308
(Today's lesson: Nice slaps for nice slaps)

416
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:20,478
That wasn't too hard.

417
00:15:20,578 --> 00:15:21,638
That was the fourth slap.

418
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:25,108
Se Chan acquired the right to give out...

419
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:26,408
two I Go Stickers.

420
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:27,808
Please open the strongbox and take the Stickers.

421
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:29,108
All right.

422
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,178
It doesn't matter even if you give one to me.

423
00:15:31,178 --> 00:15:32,208
Okay.

424
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,308
In the strongbox on your left,

425
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,108
there are two I Go Stickers.

426
00:15:36,808 --> 00:15:37,808
(Se Chan gets to give one to whomever he wants.)

427
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:39,578
Who didn't volunteer to help me out just before?

428
00:15:39,578 --> 00:15:41,108
Was it Seok Jin and Jae Seok?

429
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,108
What?

430
00:15:42,538 --> 00:15:45,438
The member with three I Go Stickers will...

431
00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:48,278
choose one member to go on the trip with.

432
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:51,108
- It's done for Haha if he gets one. - It's for certain he'll go.

433
00:15:51,478 --> 00:15:53,538
(Will he give all 2 Stickers to Seok Jin or So Min?)

434
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:55,508
Can he give all 2 Stickers to 1 person?

435
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:56,708
- Sure. - My goodness.

436
00:15:57,178 --> 00:16:01,908
(Any 1 of the 3 will have to go if they get 2 Stickers.)

437
00:16:01,978 --> 00:16:03,178
I'm nervous.

438
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:04,608
It's making me nervous to press the buttons.

439
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:06,078
(Everything is up to Se Chan now.)

440
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,478
(What will his choice be?)

441
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,308
It's not there?

442
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,278
(But)

443
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:16,638
- It's not there. - Was it a lie?

444
00:16:16,638 --> 00:16:18,108
- What's this? - It's a prank?

445
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,708
(The Stickers...)

446
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,178
(aren't there.)

447
00:16:22,178 --> 00:16:23,608
It must be hilarious if it was a lie.

448
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,708
- They're not there? - What's going on?

449
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,108
(The Stickers aren't there?)

450
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:28,538
- They must have lied to us. - It was a lie.

451
00:16:28,538 --> 00:16:29,808
- They're not there? - They're not in here.

452
00:16:29,808 --> 00:16:30,838
- What? - Really?

453
00:16:30,838 --> 00:16:33,178
The real race for today is...

454
00:16:33,738 --> 00:16:35,008
- What? - What's going on?

455
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:36,278
(Was there a hidden race behind today's mission?)

456
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:38,908
- The real race for today is... - What?

457
00:16:38,908 --> 00:16:42,508
Defend the Stickers, Thieves Among Us.

458
00:16:42,508 --> 00:16:45,508
(Today's real race is Thieves Among Us.)

459
00:16:45,908 --> 00:16:47,808
(What did he just say?)

460
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:48,908
My goodness.

461
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:51,108
(What did he just say?)

462
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:52,378
Let me slap him just once.

463
00:16:53,308 --> 00:16:56,008
(Is this really happening?)

464
00:16:56,008 --> 00:16:57,478
You went too far.

465
00:16:57,478 --> 00:16:58,838
(Don't you see my red forehead?)

466
00:16:58,838 --> 00:17:00,838
- What are you trying to pull? - This is ridiculous.

467
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,738
- Excuse me. - What's going on?

468
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:03,908
You're not the one to be worked up.

469
00:17:03,908 --> 00:17:05,408
- What was all that we did today? - Se Chan...

470
00:17:05,408 --> 00:17:07,208
- My goodness. - You shouldn't be the one.

471
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,508
- Se Chan... - So this is how you do it.

472
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:10,278
- Se Chan... - What are you doing?

473
00:17:10,538 --> 00:17:12,838
You made me get slapped from the start.

474
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:14,338
What does it make Se Chan?

475
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:15,608
(He's still in pain.)

476
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:19,008
Se Chan's two I Go Stickers...

477
00:17:19,008 --> 00:17:21,608
have been stolen by someone among the Running Man members.

478
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,838
- Among us? - Who is it?

479
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:26,808
Among you, there are two thieves...

480
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:29,008
who stole the Stickers, five civilians,

481
00:17:29,008 --> 00:17:32,008
and one sheriff who is on the civilians' side.

482
00:17:32,808 --> 00:17:36,608
The civilians will win the race if all two thieves are caught...

483
00:17:36,608 --> 00:17:38,278
before the race ends.

484
00:17:38,278 --> 00:17:42,208
The stolen Stickers will be given to the two thieves.

485
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:45,338
However, if the sheriff on the civilians' side is taken out,

486
00:17:45,338 --> 00:17:47,578
the thieves will win today's race,

487
00:17:47,578 --> 00:17:50,538
and the Stickers will be given to whomever they want.

488
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:54,208
I'll provide the first hint for catching the thieves...

489
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,208
to Se Chan who was supposed to have the right to give out the Stickers.

490
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,308
(Se Chan's provided a hint.)

491
00:17:57,308 --> 00:17:58,708
- That's worth being slapped. - Yes, after all.

492
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,008
Se Chan could be the thief.

493
00:18:00,008 --> 00:18:01,278
- I got slapped for something. - It could be him.

494
00:18:01,278 --> 00:18:02,808
- You did. - It's not me.

495
00:18:02,808 --> 00:18:04,538
I wouldn't tell you even if I was the thief.

496
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,008
It's really not me.

497
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:08,578
You can either share the hint with the others or not.

498
00:18:08,578 --> 00:18:11,508
But you should be careful since you don't know who the thieves are.

499
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:14,578
All right. 30 seconds have passed. Please destroy the hint.

500
00:18:14,808 --> 00:18:16,508
- Goodness. - Let's share it.

501
00:18:16,508 --> 00:18:19,408
I read the first hint,

502
00:18:19,408 --> 00:18:23,608
and I think I can share this with you because it's too broad.

503
00:18:23,608 --> 00:18:25,408
We need to guess by looking at each hint 1 by 1.

504
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:26,578
Why are you sweating so much?

505
00:18:26,578 --> 00:18:28,008
There are two thieves.

506
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:30,008
- One is... - It's a woman, right?

507
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:31,208
- No. - Then?

508
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,908
One is married.

509
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:35,708
- I'm married. - That's a big hint.

510
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,008
- It can't be me. - All right.

511
00:18:37,008 --> 00:18:38,078
- Listen to me. - It's them two.

512
00:18:38,078 --> 00:18:39,408
Have you seen me this calm before?

513
00:18:39,408 --> 00:18:40,478
(The married members deny first.)

514
00:18:40,478 --> 00:18:42,378
- Look. - 1 among those 3 is the thief.

515
00:18:42,378 --> 00:18:43,908
Let me clear things out.

516
00:18:43,908 --> 00:18:45,738
So Min and Jae Seok.

517
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:47,078
- They're likely to be the thieves. - It's not me.

518
00:18:47,078 --> 00:18:48,438
- Think about it. - I...

519
00:18:48,438 --> 00:18:49,908
Se Chan may be lying.

520
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:52,378
- All right. - For today's mission,

521
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:54,708
you'll change into uniforms and move to another place.

522
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:55,738
Let's go.

523
00:18:55,738 --> 00:18:57,608
(1 of the 2 thieves is married.)

524
00:18:59,078 --> 00:19:00,978
(They move to another location.)

525
00:19:00,978 --> 00:19:03,278
So far, I have...

526
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:07,578
Jae Seok and So Min as the thieves in mind.

527
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:08,578
It's similar to my guess.

528
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:10,208
Shut it, you punk.

529
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,978
- What did you say? - You punk.

530
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:14,378
You know nothing, so don't be cheeky.

531
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:15,408
(They act up drastically.)

532
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:16,578
- My goodness. - You punk.

533
00:19:16,578 --> 00:19:18,578
But So Min is unusually quiet today.

534
00:19:18,578 --> 00:19:20,078
Trust me. It's really not me.

535
00:19:20,078 --> 00:19:22,108
- She's not talkative today. - I promise.

536
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:23,578
(Ji Hyo is quiet too.)

537
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:25,108
All right, everyone.

538
00:19:25,108 --> 00:19:27,808
You'll start your mission to acquire...

539
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:29,208
the second hint.

540
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,708
My goodness.

541
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,608
(They go onto their mission with suspicions.)

542
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:36,108
This mission is called...

543
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,508
Song Relay.

544
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:38,808
(The mission is called Song Relay.)

545
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:40,108
- Oh, this. - It's difficult.

546
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:42,808
I'll sing a song first.

547
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:45,278
The next person will sing another song...

548
00:19:45,278 --> 00:19:47,478
that starts with the last word of my lyrics.

549
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:48,808
(They'll acquire a hint if they succeed.)

550
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:50,478
All right, we'll now start...

551
00:19:50,478 --> 00:19:51,708
- Song Relay. - The last word.

552
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,308
- Let's do this. - Watch each other closely.

553
00:19:53,578 --> 00:19:55,508
I'll go first.

554
00:19:56,408 --> 00:20:02,408
("I'm Sorry" by Kim Gun Mo)

555
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:04,508
- That's the last word. - A song that starts with it.

556
00:20:04,508 --> 00:20:09,708
Excuse me, is someone out there?

557
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,408
- Is someone out there? - There.

558
00:20:14,178 --> 00:20:16,008
(He's flustered.)

559
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:17,078
There...

560
00:20:18,648 --> 00:20:21,208
(Jong Kook fails.)

561
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,578
- You're suspicious. - Hey.

562
00:20:22,578 --> 00:20:23,708
I swear.

563
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,408
- Hold on. - Think of one.

564
00:20:25,578 --> 00:20:28,378
- There, there - You just heard him say it.

565
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:29,808
Try it.

566
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:32,008
- I love you - See? You can't think of one.

567
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,308
- Jong Kook, don't be so worked up. - Try it!

568
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:38,208
I mean, it doesn't make sense. I can't think of anything.

569
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,378
I swear.

570
00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:41,278
- Hold on. - I swear.

571
00:20:41,278 --> 00:20:43,108
Why is he so worked up when he got it wrong?

572
00:20:44,278 --> 00:20:45,808
What's wrong with you?

573
00:20:45,808 --> 00:20:48,338
- It's not that we made a mistake. - Why are you so mad at us?

574
00:20:48,338 --> 00:20:49,808
But it's so difficult.

575
00:20:49,908 --> 00:20:53,108
I'm not sure what his identity is, but he's so mad at us.

576
00:20:53,438 --> 00:20:54,808
- Think about it. - We can't say anything to you.

577
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:55,838
You're...

578
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:58,008
You're either a thief, the sheriff, or a psychopath.

579
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,408
Hey.

580
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:03,338
If you can't control your temper like this...

581
00:21:03,338 --> 00:21:05,008
He isn't just a civilian.

582
00:21:05,008 --> 00:21:06,378
You'll cause a big mess at this rate.

583
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:07,608
(He may be a psychopathic civilian.)

584
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:09,838
- He's strange. - Just suspect me. I don't care.

585
00:21:09,838 --> 00:21:12,108
- He's suspicious. - But I really can't do this.

586
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:13,978
I really can't do this. Seriously.

587
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:15,478
Gosh.

588
00:21:15,478 --> 00:21:16,608
(We've done nothing so far.)

589
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,908
- What are you doing? - If you can't do it,

590
00:21:17,908 --> 00:21:19,108
get off this bus.

591
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:22,378
(They're now criticizing him instead of suspecting him.)

592
00:21:22,378 --> 00:21:23,508
Leave.

593
00:21:23,508 --> 00:21:25,738
I can't play Name Tag Elimination either.

594
00:21:25,738 --> 00:21:28,278
I've never seen a member like him before.

595
00:21:28,778 --> 00:21:29,838
By the way,

596
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:32,208
can we play a different game?

597
00:21:32,578 --> 00:21:34,608
How about you recite...

598
00:21:35,508 --> 00:21:36,508
the time tables?

599
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:38,408
Okay, that sounds good.

600
00:21:38,408 --> 00:21:40,838
Let's start with Jong Kook.

601
00:21:40,838 --> 00:21:42,278
- Give us something easy. - Our pride is on the line.

602
00:21:42,278 --> 00:21:44,738
(They succeed if all members answer correctly.)

603
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:46,278
- 5 times 3? - 15.

604
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:47,778
- 6 times 3? - 18.

605
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:48,808
7 times 3?

606
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:49,908
21.

607
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,178
- 2 times 5? - 10.

608
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,508
- 6 times 4? - 24.

609
00:21:52,508 --> 00:21:53,838
- 6 times 5? - 15.

610
00:21:53,838 --> 00:21:57,508
(Her answer to 6 times 5 is 15.)

611
00:21:57,808 --> 00:21:59,008
That's wrong, Ji Hyo.

612
00:21:59,008 --> 00:22:00,608
Come on. Let's do it again.

613
00:22:00,608 --> 00:22:01,938
- What did you say? - Ji Hyo.

614
00:22:01,938 --> 00:22:05,908
(How can she answer incorrectly so naturally?)

615
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,338
I'm suspicious of you.

616
00:22:07,338 --> 00:22:08,678
- Why did you do that? - She's strange.

617
00:22:08,678 --> 00:22:09,738
Are you a thief?

618
00:22:09,738 --> 00:22:14,808
(They get no hints due to Ji Hyo and Jong Kook's mistakes.)

619
00:22:15,378 --> 00:22:16,408
- I'm sorry. - Are you a thief?

620
00:22:16,408 --> 00:22:18,078
- No, I'm not. - I think she is.

621
00:22:18,078 --> 00:22:19,208
- No. - Aren't you a thief?

622
00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:24,278
You will not be given the hint related to the thief.

623
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:27,378
I wish I had memorized the multiplication tables.

624
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:29,938
I know that 6 times 5 is 30.

625
00:22:29,938 --> 00:22:30,938
Of course you do.

626
00:22:31,478 --> 00:22:33,608
(A gymnasium at D University)

627
00:22:33,608 --> 00:22:34,778
What's going on?

628
00:22:35,408 --> 00:22:37,378
(They must identify the thieves.)

629
00:22:37,378 --> 00:22:39,808
(Is this where the missions are?)

630
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:40,808
One-person Mission.

631
00:22:40,808 --> 00:22:42,308
(What are these missions?)

632
00:22:42,308 --> 00:22:43,738
I know what it is.

633
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:46,738
(He recalls the missions.)

634
00:22:46,738 --> 00:22:49,008
- What is it? - It's my favorite.

635
00:22:49,008 --> 00:22:51,408
- I remember this game. - I used to play it a lot.

636
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,338
Rock-paper-scissors. I lost.

637
00:22:53,508 --> 00:22:54,678
That's right, Kwang Soo.

638
00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:58,378
All right. For this mission,

639
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,038
you'll play as a team.

640
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:02,108
It's called Relaying with the Thieves.

641
00:23:02,108 --> 00:23:03,138
(Relaying with the Thieves)

642
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:06,408
(Relaying with the Thieves?)

643
00:23:06,408 --> 00:23:08,738
You succeed if you finish the five courses...

644
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:11,878
in relay within the time limit.

645
00:23:12,108 --> 00:23:15,578
Randomly pick a member's name from the box.

646
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:17,178
That person is the player.

647
00:23:17,508 --> 00:23:19,138
It's not about your skills.

648
00:23:19,838 --> 00:23:21,408
- This is difficult. - Ji Hyo...

649
00:23:21,408 --> 00:23:23,608
must pick the name since she's lucky.

650
00:23:23,608 --> 00:23:25,408
You don't know what will happen.

651
00:23:25,508 --> 00:23:27,338
Do you see the tank filled with ink?

652
00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:28,478
- Yes. - Come on.

653
00:23:28,478 --> 00:23:31,908
There are three hints related to the thieves inside the tank.

654
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:34,938
The ink fills up as time passes.

655
00:23:34,938 --> 00:23:37,338
All hints are gone after 10 minutes.

656
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:39,008
Okay.

657
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,578
The thieves will try to stop us.

658
00:23:40,578 --> 00:23:42,138
It will become more obvious.

659
00:23:42,138 --> 00:23:43,738
It definitely will be obvious.

660
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:47,338
(While members try to clear the missions to obtain hints,)

661
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:48,608
(the thieves will try to stop them from clearing the mission.)

662
00:23:48,608 --> 00:23:50,208
It'll be very obvious.

663
00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:52,308
Here's a short explanation. The first course is...

664
00:23:52,308 --> 00:23:55,008
kicking a jegi 5 times after 5 elephant nose turns.

665
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:56,838
- Kicking a jegi is hard. - I can't kick a jegi...

666
00:23:56,838 --> 00:23:59,208
- even without turning. - The second course...

667
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,338
- involves two people. They must... - Don't try so hard.

668
00:24:01,338 --> 00:24:04,978
touch their index fingers after 5 elephant turns.

669
00:24:05,178 --> 00:24:07,038
It's more difficult than you think.

670
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:08,838
- It's hard. - You're right.

671
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:10,108
(It's rather difficult.)

672
00:24:10,478 --> 00:24:12,478
The third course is a game from the past.

673
00:24:12,478 --> 00:24:13,508
Rock-paper-scissors.

674
00:24:13,508 --> 00:24:15,338
The game is based on luck.

675
00:24:15,338 --> 00:24:18,208
I'm confident about playing rock-paper-scissors.

676
00:24:18,408 --> 00:24:22,208
For the 4th course, 3 people must say words that start...

677
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,608
- with the given consonant. - The first consonant?

678
00:24:23,938 --> 00:24:25,138
It involves thinking.

679
00:24:25,138 --> 00:24:26,808
Here's the last course.

680
00:24:27,138 --> 00:24:29,108
It's shooting the basketball into the hoop.

681
00:24:29,108 --> 00:24:31,308
Haha should play basketball.

682
00:24:31,308 --> 00:24:33,038
- Haha? - I'm good at it.

683
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,108
If Haha gets picked...

684
00:24:34,508 --> 00:24:35,508
He's good at basketball.

685
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:41,408
Don't the thieves have too much of a disadvantage?

686
00:24:42,778 --> 00:24:45,608
Don't the thieves have too much of a disadvantage?

687
00:24:45,608 --> 00:24:46,908
Why do you say that?

688
00:24:47,408 --> 00:24:49,838
Are you at a disadvantage?

689
00:24:49,838 --> 00:24:50,838
(Flustered)

690
00:24:50,838 --> 00:24:51,838
- Yes. - Why do you say that?

691
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:53,338
I saw you swallow.

692
00:24:53,838 --> 00:24:56,908
(His throat trembles.)

693
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:58,308
Why do you say that?

694
00:24:58,408 --> 00:24:59,608
The thieves are at a disadvantage.

695
00:24:59,908 --> 00:25:01,508
- Are you... - It will be difficult.

696
00:25:01,508 --> 00:25:03,408
Are you thinking from the thieves' perspective?

697
00:25:03,408 --> 00:25:05,178
- That's right. - Right?

698
00:25:05,178 --> 00:25:06,938
We didn't think that way.

699
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,338
- Let's find out if it is. - It's disadvantageous.

700
00:25:08,338 --> 00:25:10,208
It's easy to clear the mission.

701
00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:11,378
Let's do it.

702
00:25:11,378 --> 00:25:13,008
(Will the thieves succeed?)

703
00:25:13,008 --> 00:25:15,308
- Right? - I can't do it.

704
00:25:15,308 --> 00:25:17,808
- You have to kick harder. - Jae Seok is good at it.

705
00:25:17,938 --> 00:25:19,008
The jegi seems strange.

706
00:25:19,338 --> 00:25:20,338
It's a good jegi.

707
00:25:20,338 --> 00:25:21,708
Jae Seok is good.

708
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:23,308
- It's difficult. - Try it, Seok Jin.

709
00:25:23,308 --> 00:25:24,308
It's difficult.

710
00:25:24,478 --> 00:25:26,338
It's hard to kick it without turning.

711
00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:27,508
- Okay. - Hey.

712
00:25:27,738 --> 00:25:29,938
We must suspect those who say that they can't do it.

713
00:25:29,938 --> 00:25:32,338
(Haha starts playing detective.)

714
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:37,208
(Thieves will pretend that they can't kick the jegi.)

715
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:39,208
I've never been good at it.

716
00:25:40,738 --> 00:25:41,938
Give it to me.

717
00:25:41,938 --> 00:25:43,208
Wait in line.

718
00:25:44,738 --> 00:25:45,838
It's loose.

719
00:25:45,838 --> 00:25:47,078
Look, this is how to do it.

720
00:25:47,508 --> 00:25:48,908
- It's loose. - Look.

721
00:25:48,908 --> 00:25:50,938
(Goodness)

722
00:25:52,508 --> 00:25:54,938
Seok Jin is really annoyed.

723
00:25:56,378 --> 00:25:58,138
It's better to do it loose.

724
00:25:58,138 --> 00:25:59,138
(Jae Seok takes it away.)

725
00:25:59,408 --> 00:26:01,078
(How dare you?)

726
00:26:02,838 --> 00:26:04,578
He took it away.

727
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:07,978
It might be better to play it loose.

728
00:26:09,408 --> 00:26:12,108
(Did you trust me?)

729
00:26:12,478 --> 00:26:14,808
It may be better to play it loose.

730
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:16,408
It's frustrating.

731
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,938
Let me try it.

732
00:26:17,938 --> 00:26:19,578
Let's do a cheer.

733
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,578
Come together.

734
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,408
- In 3, 2, 1. Let's go. - Let's go.

735
00:26:22,408 --> 00:26:24,578
- We're good at playing as a team. - Right.

736
00:26:24,578 --> 00:26:25,578
Get ready.

737
00:26:25,578 --> 00:26:27,808
(The time limit is 10 minutes. The countdown starts.)

738
00:26:28,938 --> 00:26:29,938
Haha.

739
00:26:29,938 --> 00:26:31,308
(The first player is Haha.)

740
00:26:31,308 --> 00:26:32,608
- Do it now. - Start turning.

741
00:26:32,608 --> 00:26:34,138
- Hurry. - Turn now.

742
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:35,708
- Start. - You should turn first.

743
00:26:35,938 --> 00:26:39,378
- 2, 3, 4, 5. - That's good.

744
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:41,308
Kick it five times. Start.

745
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:43,608
- 1, 2. - That's good.

746
00:26:43,608 --> 00:26:45,578
- 3, 4. - Come on.

747
00:26:45,578 --> 00:26:48,338
(Haha only kicks it 3 times.)

748
00:26:48,338 --> 00:26:50,308
- What happened? - That's not right.

749
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:51,408
- I was so close. - So Min.

750
00:26:51,408 --> 00:26:52,908
- It's So Min. - Hurry up.

751
00:26:52,908 --> 00:26:54,608
The next player is up.

752
00:26:54,608 --> 00:26:56,608
- 1, 2. - 1, 2.

753
00:26:56,608 --> 00:26:58,478
(She can't even hold her nose.)

754
00:26:58,478 --> 00:27:00,478
- 3, 4. - We don't have time.

755
00:27:00,478 --> 00:27:01,838
Turn quickly. Here you go.

756
00:27:01,838 --> 00:27:03,178
Don't try so hard.

757
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:04,608
She seems suspicious.

758
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:06,478
- Get out. - She seems suspicious.

759
00:27:06,478 --> 00:27:07,478
(Get out.)

760
00:27:07,808 --> 00:27:08,808
Hurry, we don't have time.

761
00:27:09,408 --> 00:27:10,408
Next is Se Chan.

762
00:27:10,408 --> 00:27:11,408
(Se Chan is up next.)

763
00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:13,078
He'll definitely succeed.

764
00:27:13,108 --> 00:27:14,108
It's strange if he fails.

765
00:27:14,108 --> 00:27:16,178
- 3, 4. - It's 4.

766
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,738
- Five. - Go ahead.

767
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:19,838
- 1, 2. - He'll make it.

768
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,178
- He got it. - Five.

769
00:27:21,178 --> 00:27:22,408
Let's go.

770
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:24,138
(He somehow completes the first course.)

771
00:27:24,138 --> 00:27:25,408
- Let's go. - Great.

772
00:27:25,578 --> 00:27:26,738
I'll pick the names.

773
00:27:26,738 --> 00:27:28,808
- Okay. - Let's see.

774
00:27:28,808 --> 00:27:30,308
- Jae Seok. - Pick another one.

775
00:27:30,308 --> 00:27:31,338
Pick another one.

776
00:27:31,338 --> 00:27:32,408
Pick one more name.

777
00:27:33,178 --> 00:27:34,578
- Gosh, it's me. - Turn.

778
00:27:34,578 --> 00:27:35,738
- Get ready, set, go. - Go.

779
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:37,678
- 1, 2. - 1, 2.

780
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:40,078
- 3, 4. - 3, 4.

781
00:27:40,078 --> 00:27:41,938
- Will they succeed? - Touch the finger.

782
00:27:41,938 --> 00:27:42,938
Do it in one go.

783
00:27:44,408 --> 00:27:45,508
They're dizzy.

784
00:27:45,808 --> 00:27:46,908
Try it again.

785
00:27:46,908 --> 00:27:48,038
(They fail to touch.)

786
00:27:49,178 --> 00:27:51,008
(They're pathetic.)

787
00:27:51,008 --> 00:27:53,338
(If they fail, they must start again from the beginning.)

788
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,808
We have to start again.

789
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:56,508
(They're at the risk of losing one hint.)

790
00:27:56,838 --> 00:27:58,508
- Jong Kook. - He'll make it.

791
00:27:58,508 --> 00:27:59,508
We'll succeed.

792
00:27:59,508 --> 00:28:01,508
1, 2... 5.

793
00:28:01,508 --> 00:28:02,508
- He got it. - Hurry.

794
00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:03,838
- Concentrate. - You must concentrate.

795
00:28:03,838 --> 00:28:05,278
- 1, 2. - He got it.

796
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:06,908
- 3, 4. - Let's go.

797
00:28:06,908 --> 00:28:08,608
- He made it. - Let's go.

798
00:28:08,608 --> 00:28:10,338
(He's proud of himself.)

799
00:28:10,808 --> 00:28:12,508
- Pick two names. - Ji Hyo and Jae Seok.

800
00:28:12,508 --> 00:28:13,938
- Hurry up. - Jae Seok.

801
00:28:14,078 --> 00:28:15,078
- Turn. - One.

802
00:28:15,078 --> 00:28:17,038
Jae Seok is bad at turning.

803
00:28:17,138 --> 00:28:18,138
You're doing well.

804
00:28:18,138 --> 00:28:19,178
Come on.

805
00:28:19,178 --> 00:28:20,408
- Hurry up. - Start.

806
00:28:20,478 --> 00:28:23,508
(They successfully come in contact.)

807
00:28:24,138 --> 00:28:25,508
- We did it. - They made it.

808
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:27,108
Move to the next one.

809
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:28,578
- Hurry up. - It's rock-paper-scissors.

810
00:28:28,578 --> 00:28:29,978
Who is it?

811
00:28:30,078 --> 00:28:31,778
- Se Chan. - I'm good at it.

812
00:28:32,108 --> 00:28:33,138
(He's confident.)

813
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,108
(From the start,)

814
00:28:36,108 --> 00:28:39,078
(he expressed his confidence about the game.)

815
00:28:39,508 --> 00:28:41,138
Se Chan is good.

816
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:44,278
(Will he defeat the machine?)

817
00:28:46,078 --> 00:28:48,578
(He loses in 1 second.)

818
00:28:48,578 --> 00:28:49,578
I lost.

819
00:28:51,008 --> 00:28:52,008
(Flustered)

820
00:28:52,008 --> 00:28:53,008
Come on.

821
00:28:53,008 --> 00:28:54,338
(Everyone is annoyed.)

822
00:28:54,338 --> 00:28:55,608
You said you were confident.

823
00:28:55,938 --> 00:28:57,308
- Did he lose? - Is that all?

824
00:28:57,308 --> 00:28:59,108
- Wait. - You said you're good.

825
00:28:59,108 --> 00:29:00,578
You said you're good at it.

826
00:29:00,578 --> 00:29:01,608
Do we go back?

827
00:29:02,078 --> 00:29:03,908
- Let's start again. - Pick a name.

828
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,308
- Pick a name now. - I'm so sorry.

829
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:06,708
- I'm sorry. - Pick a name.

830
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:09,178
The hints are getting erased.

831
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:10,578
- Seok Jin. - Seok Jin.

832
00:29:10,578 --> 00:29:11,838
Seok Jin is up.

833
00:29:11,838 --> 00:29:13,278
- It's Seok Jin. - I don't think...

834
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:14,838
- he'll make it. - One.

835
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:16,838
2, 3.

836
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,508
- Four. - You must succeed.

837
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:19,508
(He turns one more time.)

838
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:20,938
He turned six times.

839
00:29:21,608 --> 00:29:22,678
(We don't have time to waste.)

840
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,078
- What is he doing? - 1, 2.

841
00:29:24,078 --> 00:29:25,108
Did he get it?

842
00:29:25,108 --> 00:29:26,778
He seems suspicious.

843
00:29:27,508 --> 00:29:29,208
(Seok Jin is suspicious.)

844
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:30,208
He's also strange.

845
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:33,478
- Wasn't Seok Jin good at it? - No.

846
00:29:33,578 --> 00:29:35,338
- It's strange. - It's Seok Jin.

847
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:36,908
1, 2.

848
00:29:37,378 --> 00:29:39,208
- 3, 4. - This is too difficult.

849
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,508
- Okay. - Turn one more time.

850
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:43,308
- Give me the jegi. - Turn one more time.

851
00:29:43,308 --> 00:29:45,408
(He doesn't know what he's doing.)

852
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,038
Here you go, Seok Jin.

853
00:29:47,938 --> 00:29:48,938
One.

854
00:29:48,938 --> 00:29:49,938
(He falls already.)

855
00:29:50,338 --> 00:29:52,338
(Unnatural behavior and strange reaction)

856
00:29:52,338 --> 00:29:54,578
Wasn't Seok Jin good at kicking jegis?

857
00:29:54,578 --> 00:29:55,808
(Wasn't he good at it before?)

858
00:29:57,208 --> 00:30:01,408
(He moved smoothly during practice.)

859
00:30:01,408 --> 00:30:05,178
(However, he suddenly loses balance.)

860
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:07,838
It'll be strange if he's a thief.

861
00:30:07,838 --> 00:30:09,478
I can't turn anymore.

862
00:30:09,478 --> 00:30:10,478
I'm not.

863
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,208
- It makes you dizzy. - You can't fail now.

864
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:14,838
Gosh, I'm dizzy.

865
00:30:14,838 --> 00:30:16,708
- Darn it. - Kwang Soo.

866
00:30:16,738 --> 00:30:18,408
I can't kick a jegi.

867
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:20,608
That's good.

868
00:30:20,608 --> 00:30:22,178
- We don't have time. - He's ready.

869
00:30:22,478 --> 00:30:24,038
- Good luck. - Concentrate.

870
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:27,608
It's okay. Just concentrate.

871
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:29,338
(He misses it.)

872
00:30:29,338 --> 00:30:31,108
- Goodness. - I can't kick a jegi.

873
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:33,378
- I feel dizzy. - I feel too dizzy to do it.

874
00:30:33,378 --> 00:30:35,208
Keep turning. Turn more quickly.

875
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,708
You're too slow.

876
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:38,478
So Min, you turned more than five times.

877
00:30:38,478 --> 00:30:39,738
Turn one more time.

878
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:42,278
- Go and touch his finger. - Come here.

879
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,908
- Wait, come here. - I'm too dizzy.

880
00:30:44,908 --> 00:30:46,008
Come on, Jae Seok.

881
00:30:46,108 --> 00:30:48,908
(He's very suspicious.)

882
00:30:50,338 --> 00:30:52,178
- Wait. - Come on.

883
00:30:52,408 --> 00:30:54,308
- Jae Seok is suspicious. - Pick a name now.

884
00:30:54,378 --> 00:30:56,408
Isn't Jae Seok suspicious?

885
00:30:56,578 --> 00:30:57,738
I'm suspicious of him.

886
00:30:57,738 --> 00:30:59,208
(A thief could be Jae Seok.)

887
00:30:59,978 --> 00:31:01,338
Next is rock-paper-scissors.

888
00:31:01,338 --> 00:31:02,608
Kwang Soo is doing well.

889
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:04,378
- Slow down. - Don't turn too many times.

890
00:31:04,378 --> 00:31:06,038
Why did you turn so quickly?

891
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:08,938
- It makes you dizzy. - Go, Jong Kook.

892
00:31:08,938 --> 00:31:11,038
(They trusted Jong Kook.)

893
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:12,338
Go.

894
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:14,278
- Get closer. - They made it.

895
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:15,308
We made it.

896
00:31:15,308 --> 00:31:16,978
- What's next? - Next is rock-paper-scissors.

897
00:31:18,008 --> 00:31:19,508
- Se Chan. - I'm sorry.

898
00:31:19,508 --> 00:31:20,508
(He's the best at this game.)

899
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:22,578
There he is.

900
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:24,908
(He lost the game which was humiliating for him.)

901
00:31:24,908 --> 00:31:25,938
I have a good feeling about it.

902
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:30,308
(I'm going to earn my respect as the representative of the humankind.)

903
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,678
- I won! - He won!

904
00:31:31,678 --> 00:31:33,308
(I'm the king of games in Dongducheon.)

905
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,778
- I won. - He won.

906
00:31:34,778 --> 00:31:35,878
Hurry and draw the names.

907
00:31:35,878 --> 00:31:37,378
(3 members must present a word that has given syllables.)

908
00:31:37,378 --> 00:31:38,838
They are Se Chan, Jong Kook,

909
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:40,808
- and Seok Jin. - It's me?

910
00:31:40,808 --> 00:31:42,308
- They are our key players. - I'm about to throw up.

911
00:31:42,308 --> 00:31:44,208
- I'm a key player? - Who is up first?

912
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:45,278
It's "E" and "N".

913
00:31:45,378 --> 00:31:46,538
- Wife. - Today.

914
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:47,978
Today.

915
00:31:48,938 --> 00:31:50,008
Hi. Day.

916
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,908
(He gives an absurd answer.)

917
00:31:54,908 --> 00:31:56,578
- Start from the beginning. - What was that?

918
00:31:56,578 --> 00:31:58,008
What kind of a word is that?

919
00:31:58,178 --> 00:31:59,208
Hey, let's take a breath.

920
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:00,578
Let us take a moment.

921
00:32:00,808 --> 00:32:02,008
You could've said, "Hello."

922
00:32:02,008 --> 00:32:04,178
- Jong Kook, Jae Seok, - Jae Seok.

923
00:32:04,178 --> 00:32:05,408
- What is it? - and So Min.

924
00:32:05,408 --> 00:32:06,808
Get ready. Start.

925
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:07,908
"P" and "P".

926
00:32:07,908 --> 00:32:10,008
Waterfall.

927
00:32:12,408 --> 00:32:13,738
(She fails.)

928
00:32:13,738 --> 00:32:15,108
Do it again from the top.

929
00:32:16,308 --> 00:32:17,538
- We have to do it again? - It was hard getting this far.

930
00:32:17,538 --> 00:32:18,938
- Let's go. - What's wrong with you?

931
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:20,508
(They only have less than 2 minutes.)

932
00:32:20,508 --> 00:32:21,708
- We are in trouble. - What is it?

933
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:23,338
I bet the thieves are happy now.

934
00:32:23,338 --> 00:32:24,378
We lost two hints.

935
00:32:24,378 --> 00:32:25,478
- We did it. - It's here.

936
00:32:25,478 --> 00:32:26,908
This game is holding us back.

937
00:32:26,908 --> 00:32:28,178
- Let's succeed for once. - This is the problem.

938
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,478
- So Min. - It's So Min.

939
00:32:30,838 --> 00:32:34,708
(The first match of the artificial intelligence and the magnetic human)

940
00:32:35,808 --> 00:32:37,078
- You won. - We won.

941
00:32:37,078 --> 00:32:38,738
(So Min wins.)

942
00:32:39,178 --> 00:32:40,208
Everyone, come.

943
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,638
(This is So Min's first assist in the win.)

944
00:32:41,838 --> 00:32:42,908
- Kwang Soo, - Kwang Soo.

945
00:32:42,908 --> 00:32:44,308
- Se Chan, - This is the hard one.

946
00:32:45,308 --> 00:32:47,108
- and Ji Hyo. - I'll be the last.

947
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:49,108
- Hold on. - "K" and "S".

948
00:32:49,538 --> 00:32:51,108
- Hardship. - Gratitude.

949
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:53,008
- Kwang Soo. - Great.

950
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,208
(They pass the problematic 4th course at last.)

951
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:56,278
- That works. - It's the free throw.

952
00:32:56,278 --> 00:32:57,408
- It's my turn. - Do it at once.

953
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:58,538
- Please pick me. - Pick Haha.

954
00:32:58,538 --> 00:33:00,608
- Ji Hyo, pick my name. - Just pick anyone.

955
00:33:00,608 --> 00:33:02,638
- Please pick me. - Let it be Haha.

956
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:04,378
- Please. - Please.

957
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:05,708
Pick me.

958
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:08,378
(I'm the king of basketball.)

959
00:33:08,378 --> 00:33:10,578
(My left hand merely helps.)

960
00:33:10,578 --> 00:33:14,578
(To get the last hint, they are desperate for a basketball hero.)

961
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:15,578
- Don't do that. - Just pick one.

962
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:17,208
- It's Kwang Soo. - He's good.

963
00:33:18,108 --> 00:33:19,738
(Kwang Soo steps up to the line.)

964
00:33:19,738 --> 00:33:20,738
Kwang Soo, take a breath.

965
00:33:20,738 --> 00:33:22,608
You have to make a big parabola.

966
00:33:22,608 --> 00:33:25,108
- I'll see if you're a thief or not. - Go back to your spot.

967
00:33:25,108 --> 00:33:26,608
- We don't know what will happen. - I'll keep an eye on you.

968
00:33:26,608 --> 00:33:29,178
(The fates of the citizens depend on Kwang Soo's free throw.)

969
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:30,808
- We don't know what will happen. - I'll keep an eye on you.

970
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:34,008
(Will Kwang Soo be able to make the free throw?)

971
00:33:37,938 --> 00:33:38,938
He did it.

972
00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:41,708
Nice!

973
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:43,108
(The ball goes in!)

974
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,638
Nice!

975
00:33:45,338 --> 00:33:46,408
He did it.

976
00:33:46,408 --> 00:33:49,678
(Of course I did it! I am a genius.)

977
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:51,278
He did that on his first try.

978
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:52,638
That was great.

979
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:54,378
- It was amazing. - You did it.

980
00:33:54,938 --> 00:33:56,738
(With 50 seconds left, they accomplished their mission.)

981
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:58,008
He's not the thief.

982
00:33:58,338 --> 00:33:59,578
Everyone,

983
00:33:59,578 --> 00:34:02,878
- you may take the last hint. - What is it?

984
00:34:03,378 --> 00:34:04,938
- Let's read it together. - Let's do that.

985
00:34:05,578 --> 00:34:06,578
- Let's see. - The thieves...

986
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:09,608
(It's a happy moment for everyone except for the thieves.)

987
00:34:09,608 --> 00:34:10,808
- Here it is. - What is it?

988
00:34:10,908 --> 00:34:12,308
- What is it? - It's long.

989
00:34:12,908 --> 00:34:14,708
"One of the thieves is unlucky."

990
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:15,838
"I'm not sure about the other one."

991
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:21,178
(One of the thieves is unlucky. I'm not sure about the other one.)

992
00:34:21,178 --> 00:34:25,408
(One of the thieves is unlucky. I'm not sure about the other one.)

993
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,478
- It's Kwang Soo. - Unlucky ones, please gather.

994
00:34:28,008 --> 00:34:29,438
- It's Kwang Soo. - There are four.

995
00:34:29,508 --> 00:34:30,638
- You should stay. - Wait, I am...

996
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:32,438
- I am not unlucky. - You are unlucky too.

997
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:34,208
- Hey. - Kwang Soo must be the thief.

998
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:36,278
- He's single too. - I am luckier than you guys.

999
00:34:36,278 --> 00:34:37,778
Everyone, the thief is out.

1000
00:34:37,778 --> 00:34:39,838
- So Min, you need to join us. - The hints tell us it's Jae Seok.

1001
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:40,838
- That's right. - It must be him.

1002
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:42,778
- It's Jae Seok. - He's married and unlucky.

1003
00:34:43,108 --> 00:34:45,908
The other one isn't married and unlucky. It must be one of the rest.

1004
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:49,278
We can speculate that the thieves are So Min and Jae Seok.

1005
00:34:49,278 --> 00:34:52,078
(So Min and Jae Seok become the leading candidates.)

1006
00:34:52,078 --> 00:34:54,208
Who is someone that is married and unlucky?

1007
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:55,438
- It's Jae Seok. - It must be Jae Seok.

1008
00:34:55,438 --> 00:34:56,878
- You are married and unlucky too. - The description fits you too.

1009
00:34:57,278 --> 00:34:59,478
(Are you introducing yourself?)

1010
00:34:59,908 --> 00:35:01,838
- When I was kicking the jegi... - You all know me.

1011
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:03,548
- I don't look suspicious today. - Actually, Seok Jin...

1012
00:35:03,548 --> 00:35:06,908
- failed a lot of missions. - I'm myself today.

1013
00:35:06,908 --> 00:35:09,008
- I suspected him a few times. - No, you don't.

1014
00:35:09,578 --> 00:35:13,208
(At this moment, So Min takes a step back and observes.)

1015
00:35:13,408 --> 00:35:17,078
(Se Chan clearly said one of the thieves was married.)

1016
00:35:17,638 --> 00:35:22,208
- I think it's Jong Kook. - That was out of nowhere.

1017
00:35:22,638 --> 00:35:23,678
Really?

1018
00:35:23,678 --> 00:35:28,738
Unlucky member who is single is Kwang Soo. They're the thieves.

1019
00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:29,938
I am not married.

1020
00:35:29,938 --> 00:35:32,108
(I am not married.)

1021
00:35:32,108 --> 00:35:33,508
- Hey. - Oh, right.

1022
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:35,708
(She suspects a bachelor as a married thief.)

1023
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:37,708
- Oh, right. - I'm single.

1024
00:35:37,738 --> 00:35:38,738
- What's up with her? - I'm about to lose it.

1025
00:35:38,738 --> 00:35:40,008
Shouldn't you feel disappointed?

1026
00:35:40,008 --> 00:35:42,008
Hey, let's know the facts before we pick a thief.

1027
00:35:42,178 --> 00:35:43,978
- You should know he's single. - Hey, I am...

1028
00:35:43,978 --> 00:35:45,208
Who is my wife?

1029
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:46,608
- Look him up online. - I got mixed up.

1030
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:47,878
- Why do you say I'm married? - I made a mistake.

1031
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:49,678
Is it so wrong that he is still single?

1032
00:35:49,678 --> 00:35:51,838
You think he got married when he filmed "X-Man".

1033
00:35:52,508 --> 00:35:54,578
- "X-Man"? - I'm telling her that you didn't.

1034
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:56,108
He didn't get married then.

1035
00:35:56,108 --> 00:35:57,578
- I'm sorry. - Poor Jong Kook.

1036
00:35:57,938 --> 00:36:00,338
- We'll solve it with one more hint. - We can solve it then.

1037
00:36:00,338 --> 00:36:01,578
Is there another one in it?

1038
00:36:01,678 --> 00:36:03,008
We can't read anyway because of the ink.

1039
00:36:03,008 --> 00:36:05,738
There might be people who aren't sad about losing the hints.

1040
00:36:05,738 --> 00:36:07,178
- Check their reactions. - I was very sad.

1041
00:36:07,178 --> 00:36:08,438
He didn't look sad.

1042
00:36:08,438 --> 00:36:09,778
- Haha. - You looked relieved.

1043
00:36:09,778 --> 00:36:11,608
Haha, think about what I did in the beginning.

1044
00:36:11,608 --> 00:36:12,878
If you think I'm one of the thieves...

1045
00:36:13,008 --> 00:36:15,978
- Se Chan did well kicking the jegi. - Isn't Haha weird?

1046
00:36:15,978 --> 00:36:18,108
- You say others are the thieves. - He's acting strangely.

1047
00:36:18,108 --> 00:36:19,548
- You are... - He does that because it's him.

1048
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:21,808
You are leading the investigation today.

1049
00:36:21,808 --> 00:36:23,008
- I am? - Yes.

1050
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:26,178
All right, everyone. You will move to the next place.

1051
00:36:26,548 --> 00:36:29,938
When you are moving to the next place, you won't go all together.

1052
00:36:30,478 --> 00:36:33,608
You will split into 2 groups of 4 and go.

1053
00:36:34,338 --> 00:36:35,738
We are isolating the thieves?

1054
00:36:36,478 --> 00:36:38,108
Everyone, let us get going.

1055
00:36:38,108 --> 00:36:40,478
- Thieves will try to ride together. - Let's go.

1056
00:36:40,478 --> 00:36:42,378
They know each other. So they will try to ride together.

1057
00:36:43,408 --> 00:36:46,208
You think you are certain that I am the thief.

1058
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,478
Yes, I just wanted to ride with a thief.

1059
00:36:47,908 --> 00:36:49,108
I wonder what you will do.

1060
00:36:49,108 --> 00:36:51,678
- I think two thieves are in here. - Goodness.

1061
00:36:51,678 --> 00:36:52,908
What I'm certain about is that...

1062
00:36:52,908 --> 00:36:55,978
The one thing we learned from the game we just played...

1063
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:58,008
- What is it? - The truth is...

1064
00:36:58,178 --> 00:36:59,308
(Sneezing)

1065
00:36:59,308 --> 00:37:00,508
I was talking about something important.

1066
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:04,008
(I felt nervous about hearing this important clue.)

1067
00:37:04,008 --> 00:37:05,108
What is it?

1068
00:37:06,008 --> 00:37:07,278
I don't think Se Chan is the thief.

1069
00:37:08,178 --> 00:37:09,738
- He's not it. - Hey, I am...

1070
00:37:09,738 --> 00:37:11,208
- You can see I'm not one either. - But...

1071
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:12,978
- before... - I am not certain about that.

1072
00:37:12,978 --> 00:37:14,208
What I'm suspicious about is...

1073
00:37:14,378 --> 00:37:16,338
when you played the second course, you were a bit weird.

1074
00:37:16,338 --> 00:37:17,738
You don't know how dizzy I was.

1075
00:37:17,738 --> 00:37:19,308
- Isn't Jae Seok the sheriff? - Really?

1076
00:37:19,378 --> 00:37:21,738
- No, he is the thief. - I think he's the sheriff.

1077
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:22,778
(I bet he is a thief.)

1078
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:25,838
- We all agree he is a thief. - He has to be the thief.

1079
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:28,108
- I think he is the thief. - Is the other one So Min?

1080
00:37:28,108 --> 00:37:29,338
I do believe it's Jae Seok.

1081
00:37:29,738 --> 00:37:32,178
Look at this. So Min is talkative.

1082
00:37:32,178 --> 00:37:34,838
- She talks a lot before the shoot. - That's right.

1083
00:37:35,178 --> 00:37:37,638
- She didn't talk during the shoot. - That's true.

1084
00:37:37,778 --> 00:37:38,978
- What's up with that? - That's a bit odd.

1085
00:37:45,108 --> 00:37:46,508
How do you feel being pegged as the thief?

1086
00:37:46,508 --> 00:37:47,708
Jae Seok, who do you think is the thief?

1087
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:49,078
- What do you think? - What's your opinion?

1088
00:37:49,078 --> 00:37:50,308
I get the feeling...

1089
00:37:50,308 --> 00:37:51,878
that it could be Haha.

1090
00:37:52,008 --> 00:37:53,408
- Haha? - Yes.

1091
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:54,708
It's because...

1092
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:56,938
(Guys, listen up.)

1093
00:37:56,938 --> 00:37:59,378
They should have a reason to steal the Stickers.

1094
00:37:59,508 --> 00:38:02,208
- Then he has the perfect motive. - That's a valid point.

1095
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:03,338
Why does he have to steal them?

1096
00:38:03,338 --> 00:38:04,838
- He has two Stickers already. - That's right.

1097
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:06,808
(Is it because he felt he would go on the trip?)

1098
00:38:06,808 --> 00:38:08,838
He is going to catch the sheriff.

1099
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:10,678
- That's right. Exactly. - He can give out the Stickers?

1100
00:38:10,878 --> 00:38:11,908
That's true.

1101
00:38:12,008 --> 00:38:13,938
- Now that I heard that... - Think rationally.

1102
00:38:13,938 --> 00:38:17,078
(Can Haha be one of the thieves since he has the motive?)

1103
00:38:19,108 --> 00:38:20,638
Anyway, I am not completely certain.

1104
00:38:21,078 --> 00:38:22,178
That's my opinion.

1105
00:38:22,178 --> 00:38:23,308
Then who is the sheriff?

1106
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:25,078
Actually...

1107
00:38:25,078 --> 00:38:26,438
I can't figure this out.

1108
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:27,938
Se Chan, I'm actually the sheriff.

1109
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:31,408
(Se Chan, I'm actually the sheriff.)

1110
00:38:31,408 --> 00:38:32,408
You are?

1111
00:38:32,408 --> 00:38:33,608
(So Min is the sheriff?)

1112
00:38:34,638 --> 00:38:37,478
(30 minutes before the opening segment)

1113
00:38:37,478 --> 00:38:40,548
(A mysterious figure came to the crew's office before the shoot.)

1114
00:38:40,808 --> 00:38:41,938
Hello.

1115
00:38:42,638 --> 00:38:46,308
(Someone visited the crew?)

1116
00:38:46,308 --> 00:38:50,608
(Why is Se Chan here?)

1117
00:38:51,008 --> 00:38:52,078
What is it?

1118
00:38:52,078 --> 00:38:54,578
(What is the identity of Se Chan?)

1119
00:38:55,578 --> 00:38:56,738
Please sit down.

1120
00:38:57,178 --> 00:39:00,808
Why did you call me here alone in secret?

1121
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:02,838
Se Chan,

1122
00:39:03,478 --> 00:39:07,008
you are the sheriff who is on the civilians' side.

1123
00:39:08,108 --> 00:39:10,478
I'm the sheriff and on the civilians' side?

1124
00:39:12,078 --> 00:39:14,678
The sheriff and the civilians must find the thieves.

1125
00:39:14,878 --> 00:39:17,808
When you eliminate the thieves at the last race, you will win.

1126
00:39:18,878 --> 00:39:20,738
(He feels a lot of pressure.)

1127
00:39:20,738 --> 00:39:21,908
Really?

1128
00:39:22,308 --> 00:39:23,738
If the sheriff is eliminated,

1129
00:39:24,438 --> 00:39:26,478
the victory will go to the thieves right away,

1130
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:28,478
and the race will end.

1131
00:39:28,938 --> 00:39:31,578
As a sheriff, do everything in your power to conceal your identity.

1132
00:39:32,178 --> 00:39:33,908
Catching the thieves without exposing yourself is the key.

1133
00:39:34,738 --> 00:39:39,178
Soon, there will be an auction, and you will bid for I Go Stickers.

1134
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:43,308
Two I Go Stickers have already been stolen by the thieves.

1135
00:39:43,478 --> 00:39:46,778
The one with the winning bid of this auction...

1136
00:39:47,378 --> 00:39:50,878
will receive a hint about the thieves instead of the Stickers.

1137
00:39:50,878 --> 00:39:53,078
In order to uncover the identities of the thieves,

1138
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,108
it's in your best interest to get the hint since you are the sheriff.

1139
00:39:56,638 --> 00:39:58,808
I will look forward to your performance today.

1140
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:04,408
(Numerous fates of the civilians are on his shoulders.)

1141
00:40:04,548 --> 00:40:06,708
If Jae Seok is the thief...

1142
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:08,308
- and choose you, it's over. - That's right.

1143
00:40:09,078 --> 00:40:12,608
I think everyone here isn't the thief.

1144
00:40:12,938 --> 00:40:14,478
- The three civilians... - I am the sheriff.

1145
00:40:15,278 --> 00:40:16,438
I don't believe you.

1146
00:40:16,438 --> 00:40:18,678
Look! I think Kwang Soo is the sheriff.

1147
00:40:18,678 --> 00:40:20,608
- He must be the sheriff. - You're the sheriff, Kwang Soo.

1148
00:40:21,508 --> 00:40:23,578
- Kwang Soo, are you the sheriff? - No, I am not.

1149
00:40:23,578 --> 00:40:25,808
(What is So Min's identity who is sounding him out?)

1150
00:40:26,678 --> 00:40:28,578
Gosh, a delicious meal is prepared for us.

1151
00:40:28,578 --> 00:40:30,208
(At a wrap restaurant in Seoul,)

1152
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,938
(there's an abundance of delicious meat and fresh vegetables.)

1153
00:40:32,978 --> 00:40:35,208
There's meat. Meat!

1154
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:36,308
(Why are they here?)

1155
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,708
- This is nice. - There's pork belly meat.

1156
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:40,578
This is one healthy meal.

1157
00:40:40,578 --> 00:40:42,078
(Who is the thief?)

1158
00:40:42,678 --> 00:40:44,708
You all chose your own seats.

1159
00:40:44,938 --> 00:40:48,278
This mission is Ssam My Way.

1160
00:40:48,278 --> 00:40:50,578
(This mission is Ssam My Way.)

1161
00:40:50,578 --> 00:40:52,338
(Ssam My Way?)

1162
00:40:52,338 --> 00:40:53,608
- Ssam My Way? - Ssam My Way?

1163
00:40:55,408 --> 00:40:56,408
This is an individual match.

1164
00:40:56,508 --> 00:40:58,838
A member who fails the mission is eliminated right away.

1165
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:02,308
Only the final victor of the mission will receive the hint.

1166
00:41:02,638 --> 00:41:05,108
If a civilian wins, the hint will be about the thieves.

1167
00:41:05,438 --> 00:41:09,008
If a thief wins, the hint will be about the sheriff.

1168
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,808
(If a thief wins, the hint will be about the sheriff and vice versa.)

1169
00:41:12,808 --> 00:41:14,008
(I have to win this game by all means.)

1170
00:41:14,008 --> 00:41:15,838
This is an important mission.

1171
00:41:18,438 --> 00:41:20,108
The first round of Ssam My Way is...

1172
00:41:20,108 --> 00:41:22,438
Ssam Relay.

1173
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:25,478
It's similar to when you play When I Go To a Market.

1174
00:41:25,478 --> 00:41:29,078
An ingredient will be added as you take turns...

1175
00:41:29,078 --> 00:41:32,138
in making a ssam in the same order. If you get the order wrong...

1176
00:41:32,138 --> 00:41:34,178
or put in a different ingredient, you'll be out.

1177
00:41:34,178 --> 00:41:36,108
You'll also have to eat all the ssam you've made until then.

1178
00:41:36,108 --> 00:41:38,078
- All of them? - Okay.

1179
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,908
(If you fail the mission, you have to eat all the ssam.)

1180
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:43,008
We'll start from So Min then.

1181
00:41:43,008 --> 00:41:44,608
Take lettuce or sesame leaf.

1182
00:41:44,608 --> 00:41:46,208
Should it be lettuce or sesame leaf?

1183
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:47,408
- It must be lettuce. - Lettuce.

1184
00:41:47,408 --> 00:41:49,638
Let's take one of each.

1185
00:41:49,638 --> 00:41:51,738
- Okay. - I'll just take lettuce.

1186
00:41:51,738 --> 00:41:54,548
- Let's take both. - I don't like having them together.

1187
00:41:54,548 --> 00:41:55,608
Seriously.

1188
00:41:55,678 --> 00:41:57,048
- Okay? - Add it as an ingredient.

1189
00:41:57,278 --> 00:41:59,308
- I'll do that. - Okay.

1190
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,708
- Okay. - It'll be my first ingredient.

1191
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:03,378
Whatever the role may be, I don't want to do it with you.

1192
00:42:03,908 --> 00:42:05,108
(Speechless)

1193
00:42:06,138 --> 00:42:08,378
All right. Let's get it started. So Min is the first to go.

1194
00:42:08,378 --> 00:42:09,778
- Okay. - Ready,

1195
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:11,138
set, go.

1196
00:42:11,638 --> 00:42:13,438
- When I make a ssam - All right.

1197
00:42:13,438 --> 00:42:15,138
I put a pickled radish on top

1198
00:42:15,138 --> 00:42:16,778
I put a pickled radish on top

1199
00:42:16,778 --> 00:42:17,778
(What's next?)

1200
00:42:17,778 --> 00:42:19,208
I put a grilled onion on top

1201
00:42:19,508 --> 00:42:22,708
A pickled radish, grilled onion

1202
00:42:23,478 --> 00:42:25,208
And a piece of pork belly on top

1203
00:42:25,508 --> 00:42:28,808
When I make a ssam, I put a pickled radish on top

1204
00:42:29,808 --> 00:42:30,878
(What was next?)

1205
00:42:30,878 --> 00:42:32,548
- You can't remember? - I do.

1206
00:42:32,548 --> 00:42:34,508
- Already? - You can't go on like this.

1207
00:42:34,508 --> 00:42:35,938
- Grilled... - She's suspicious.

1208
00:42:35,938 --> 00:42:38,048
- A grilled onion - She's really suspicious.

1209
00:42:38,048 --> 00:42:40,408
- Already? - A piece of pork belly

1210
00:42:40,408 --> 00:42:42,008
Already?

1211
00:42:42,008 --> 00:42:44,138
- It's actually... - Did you understand the rule?

1212
00:42:44,138 --> 00:42:46,338
We can't actually say she's the thief or not...

1213
00:42:46,338 --> 00:42:48,778
- by this game. - I'm thinking what to put next.

1214
00:42:48,778 --> 00:42:50,208
- She's just not good at memorizing. - I'm thinking about...

1215
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:52,638
- what to put on top next. - It's strange not to suspect her.

1216
00:42:52,638 --> 00:42:53,808
A grilled clove of garlic will do.

1217
00:42:54,078 --> 00:42:55,978
- A grilled clove of garlic on top - There you go.

1218
00:42:55,978 --> 00:42:58,878
- Okay, when I make a ssam... - Gosh, it's scary.

1219
00:42:59,738 --> 00:43:01,608
(Confident)

1220
00:43:01,608 --> 00:43:05,278
- A radish... Grilled onions. - Okay.

1221
00:43:05,278 --> 00:43:08,078
A piece of pork belly.

1222
00:43:08,308 --> 00:43:10,838
- Next is grilled garlic. - Okay.

1223
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:14,878
- And I'll put a sesame leaf on top. - My goodness.

1224
00:43:17,548 --> 00:43:20,978
(He can't believe Jong Kook put a sesame leaf on top.)

1225
00:43:20,978 --> 00:43:22,008
Why would you...

1226
00:43:22,438 --> 00:43:24,708
When I make a ssam

1227
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:26,508
I put a pickled radish

1228
00:43:26,508 --> 00:43:29,508
A grilled onion

1229
00:43:30,138 --> 00:43:33,708
I'll put a piece of pork belly on top

1230
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:37,208
Next is grilled garlic

1231
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:41,548
- I don't want to put a sesame leaf - My favorite sesame leaf

1232
00:43:41,548 --> 00:43:43,208
- But I have to - It's my favorite

1233
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:47,078
Jae Seok hates it, but he has to put it on top

1234
00:43:48,338 --> 00:43:50,638
(Shall I make a wrap with him?)

1235
00:43:50,638 --> 00:43:53,178
- A sesame leaf on top - He has to put it on top

1236
00:43:53,338 --> 00:43:54,838
- And... - It's great

1237
00:43:54,838 --> 00:43:58,578
- I'll put gochujang on top - Gochujang!

1238
00:43:58,578 --> 00:43:59,638
(He adds gochujang to it.)

1239
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:02,308
I'll make a ssam

1240
00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:04,378
I'll put a pickled radish

1241
00:44:04,878 --> 00:44:06,308
Grilled onions

1242
00:44:06,308 --> 00:44:08,638
He sounds like those typical, old men.

1243
00:44:08,638 --> 00:44:09,878
"Let me see"

1244
00:44:09,878 --> 00:44:11,708
- A piece of pork belly - All right

1245
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:14,808
- Like grannies. - Shall I put grilled garlic on top?

1246
00:44:15,338 --> 00:44:16,638
And...

1247
00:44:18,508 --> 00:44:19,508
Gochujang sounds delicious.

1248
00:44:19,508 --> 00:44:21,208
I can't put them on my ssam yet?

1249
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:22,608
No, you can't.

1250
00:44:23,008 --> 00:44:24,608
(Putting them back)

1251
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:27,708
(You have to do it when your turn comes back.)

1252
00:44:28,438 --> 00:44:31,108
(So Min, please understand the rules clearly.)

1253
00:44:31,108 --> 00:44:32,138
(Smiling brightly)

1254
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:35,278
- A sesame leaf. - Don't let them know from now on.

1255
00:44:35,578 --> 00:44:40,178
After putting a sesame leaf on top

1256
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,538
Ssamjang

1257
00:44:41,538 --> 00:44:42,738
(He's so sure.)

1258
00:44:42,738 --> 00:44:44,338
(Not gochujang?)

1259
00:44:44,338 --> 00:44:46,108
- You haven't put mine yet. - Okay!

1260
00:44:46,108 --> 00:44:47,308
(He fails the mission.)

1261
00:44:47,308 --> 00:44:48,378
It's not ssamjang?

1262
00:44:48,778 --> 00:44:51,208
- It's not ssamjang? - Yes!

1263
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:53,838
It's gochujang

1264
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:54,878
Seok Jin is out.

1265
00:44:54,878 --> 00:44:57,208
- You can have your ssam now. - It's gochujang

1266
00:44:57,208 --> 00:44:58,808
Why don't you play cards more often?

1267
00:44:59,638 --> 00:45:01,078
You should use your brain more.

1268
00:45:01,938 --> 00:45:03,108
- Do I just eat it? - Yes.

1269
00:45:03,108 --> 00:45:04,408
It looks delicious.

1270
00:45:04,908 --> 00:45:06,478
- You'll go from the start. - Right.

1271
00:45:06,478 --> 00:45:09,208
- Please have... - Do I get to eat it too?

1272
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:10,538
- You can. - Do we have it too?

1273
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:11,878
- Sure, you can. - Okay.

1274
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:14,078
- Can I add other ingredients? - Can we?

1275
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:15,508
- Can we add others on top? - Can we add other ingredients?

1276
00:45:15,508 --> 00:45:16,738
No, just have what you've made.

1277
00:45:16,738 --> 00:45:18,208
Are you telling me to eat only the radish and onion?

1278
00:45:18,678 --> 00:45:20,538
(There's nothing much inside.)

1279
00:45:20,538 --> 00:45:22,638
- She gets to have only the radish. - Yes, have it.

1280
00:45:22,638 --> 00:45:24,308
- I have meat inside. - And you're enjoying it.

1281
00:45:24,308 --> 00:45:25,578
You can't put anything else.

1282
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:27,008
(They're forced to practice non-possession.)

1283
00:45:27,008 --> 00:45:28,408
Let me put at least a piece of meat.

1284
00:45:28,408 --> 00:45:31,438
Seok Jin is out, and let's move onto another round.

1285
00:45:31,438 --> 00:45:32,678
- Let's start. - Why did I get it wrong?

1286
00:45:32,678 --> 00:45:33,708
Let's start from Haha.

1287
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:36,408
So Min will be next after Haha.

1288
00:45:36,408 --> 00:45:37,638
(2nd round of Ssam Relay)

1289
00:45:37,638 --> 00:45:39,538
When I make a ssam

1290
00:45:41,078 --> 00:45:44,138
I put three pieces of jeyuk bokkeum

1291
00:45:44,938 --> 00:45:46,938
Three pieces of jeyuk bokkeum.

1292
00:45:46,938 --> 00:45:49,678
(After jeyuk bokkeum)

1293
00:45:49,678 --> 00:45:51,378
I'll put a whole pepper.

1294
00:45:51,978 --> 00:45:53,938
(A whole pepper on top)

1295
00:45:53,938 --> 00:45:55,208
- What did you say? - What?

1296
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:57,678
- What's wrong with you? - What are you doing?

1297
00:45:58,008 --> 00:46:00,078
(I like it spicy.)

1298
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:02,508
Are you saying this whole pepper?

1299
00:46:03,438 --> 00:46:04,778
(Of course.)

1300
00:46:04,938 --> 00:46:06,908
Why would she put this in her ssam?

1301
00:46:07,138 --> 00:46:08,708
Can't we make it delicious?

1302
00:46:09,638 --> 00:46:11,308
When I make a ssam

1303
00:46:11,308 --> 00:46:13,538
I put three pieces of jeyuk bokkeum

1304
00:46:13,538 --> 00:46:15,508
A whole pepper

1305
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:18,338
Are you sure about this?

1306
00:46:19,108 --> 00:46:20,538
I'll put another lettuce on top

1307
00:46:20,538 --> 00:46:21,578
(He adds another lettuce on top.)

1308
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:24,178
This is crazy. I think I'll get it wrong again.

1309
00:46:24,808 --> 00:46:26,278
(What?)

1310
00:46:26,278 --> 00:46:28,208
When I make a ssam

1311
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:29,338
(I'm sorry, but you're out.)

1312
00:46:29,338 --> 00:46:31,478
I put three pieces of jeyuk bokkeum

1313
00:46:31,478 --> 00:46:32,938
- And - Three pieces of this...

1314
00:46:32,938 --> 00:46:34,538
(He doesn't understand the rule and memorizes hard.)

1315
00:46:34,538 --> 00:46:35,838
A whole pepper on top

1316
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:37,178
A whole pepper...

1317
00:46:38,608 --> 00:46:39,908
And

1318
00:46:40,008 --> 00:46:43,208
- Lettuce on top - Lettuce on top

1319
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:46,408
- What will go on top? - And...

1320
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:49,178
You should add grilled garlic

1321
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:53,878
No, I'll put another whole chili pepper on top

1322
00:46:54,508 --> 00:46:56,608
(A whole chili pepper is a must for ssam.)

1323
00:46:56,608 --> 00:46:57,878
I'm not going to eat this.

1324
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:02,108
It's fine as long as I don't get it wrong.

1325
00:47:03,038 --> 00:47:04,738
(What should I do if I get it wrong?)

1326
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:07,508
They're two whole chili peppers, right? After lettuce...

1327
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:10,738
- Three pieces of jeyuk bokkeum. - I think you're out.

1328
00:47:10,738 --> 00:47:12,038
- What? - You're out.

1329
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,938
- I'm out? - You're out.

1330
00:47:13,938 --> 00:47:15,138
I'm out?

1331
00:47:15,738 --> 00:47:16,938
Oh, I see.

1332
00:47:16,938 --> 00:47:17,938
(Please use your brain.)

1333
00:47:17,938 --> 00:47:19,038
Why are you making a ssam?

1334
00:47:19,038 --> 00:47:20,778
It's better to be the first to be out.

1335
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,378
When I make a ssam

1336
00:47:23,678 --> 00:47:25,938
Another lettuce on top

1337
00:47:25,938 --> 00:47:27,408
- It goes on top - Goes on top

1338
00:47:27,408 --> 00:47:29,208
Another whole chili pepper

1339
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:30,338
It goes on top

1340
00:47:30,338 --> 00:47:32,408
And I'll place one more chili on top

1341
00:47:33,008 --> 00:47:34,308
What's this?

1342
00:47:35,138 --> 00:47:37,308
(This ssam is all about chili peppers.)

1343
00:47:37,308 --> 00:47:38,538
What's this?

1344
00:47:39,538 --> 00:47:41,438
Could you give us about eight more peppers, please?

1345
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:42,708
Let's see how it goes.

1346
00:47:43,378 --> 00:47:48,008
When I make a ssam, I'll put three pieces of jeyuk bokkeum

1347
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:49,908
And!

1348
00:47:50,608 --> 00:47:54,308
I'll put a sesame leaf on top

1349
00:47:54,308 --> 00:47:55,908
Stop with that sesame leaf already!

1350
00:47:55,908 --> 00:47:56,938
(They're sick of it now.)

1351
00:47:56,938 --> 00:47:59,708
You really like sesame leaves, don't you?

1352
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:01,938
I love the smell of perilla leaves

1353
00:48:02,138 --> 00:48:04,878
Some strange punk puts a sesame leaf on top

1354
00:48:04,938 --> 00:48:07,578
- It's my favorite - And

1355
00:48:07,578 --> 00:48:09,038
It's my turn now

1356
00:48:09,038 --> 00:48:11,338
I'm not going to have this anyway

1357
00:48:11,338 --> 00:48:14,208
So I'll put three slices of raw onions

1358
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:16,178
Are you kidding me?

1359
00:48:16,178 --> 00:48:17,178
(Jae Seok adds 3 slices of raw onions.)

1360
00:48:17,178 --> 00:48:18,938
Should I put a bowl of rice on top?

1361
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:20,178
(The race is going fierce.)

1362
00:48:20,178 --> 00:48:22,508
Calm down. We have to make it edible at least.

1363
00:48:22,508 --> 00:48:25,278
We can't miss out garlic

1364
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:27,178
One clove of raw garlic

1365
00:48:27,178 --> 00:48:28,538
(He adds a clove of raw garlic to it.)

1366
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:31,678
I'll put a clove of raw garlic

1367
00:48:31,678 --> 00:48:33,208
On top

1368
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:36,708
I'll put

1369
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:41,408
1, 2, 3 napa cabbage leaves

1370
00:48:41,408 --> 00:48:43,408
- Are you serious? - On top

1371
00:48:43,778 --> 00:48:45,178
That's definitely for cows.

1372
00:48:45,508 --> 00:48:47,338
That's not for humans.

1373
00:48:47,338 --> 00:48:49,538
I'll put ssamjang on top

1374
00:48:49,538 --> 00:48:51,738
I'll put six pieces of jeyuk bokkeum

1375
00:48:51,738 --> 00:48:53,678
I'll take six pieces of jeyuk bokkeum.

1376
00:48:53,678 --> 00:48:56,608
Lettuce... Gosh, I'm so nervous.

1377
00:48:56,608 --> 00:48:58,078
- You are? - I'm so nervous.

1378
00:48:58,338 --> 00:49:00,108
- When I make a ssam - All right.

1379
00:49:00,108 --> 00:49:02,578
When I make a ssam

1380
00:49:02,578 --> 00:49:03,808
You have to hurry.

1381
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:05,408
Don't take time trying to remember.

1382
00:49:05,978 --> 00:49:07,978
- You're running out of time. - When I make a ssam

1383
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:09,608
Chili pepper

1384
00:49:09,608 --> 00:49:12,478
When I make a ssam, I put a chili pepper first

1385
00:49:12,478 --> 00:49:13,708
- Wrong. - You got it wrong.

1386
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:15,638
(She's out.)

1387
00:49:15,778 --> 00:49:17,278
It was three pieces of jeyuk bokkeum.

1388
00:49:17,278 --> 00:49:18,638
(Her love for chili peppers caused her trouble.)

1389
00:49:18,638 --> 00:49:20,338
It finally came to an end.

1390
00:49:20,338 --> 00:49:21,538
(I'm so glad it's not me.)

1391
00:49:21,538 --> 00:49:22,708
It's amazing.

1392
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:24,008
I was so nervous.

1393
00:49:24,278 --> 00:49:26,108
All right, So Min. You need to have that ssam now.

1394
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:28,008
How can she eat that?

1395
00:49:28,138 --> 00:49:30,978
She can't eat it. It's huge like a sandwich.

1396
00:49:30,978 --> 00:49:35,538
(It's a sandwich for cows, not a ssam for So Min.)

1397
00:49:35,538 --> 00:49:36,608
I...

1398
00:49:36,608 --> 00:49:38,938
(So Min's reaping what she sowed.)

1399
00:49:38,938 --> 00:49:40,108
I'm reaping what I sowed.

1400
00:49:43,708 --> 00:49:45,538
It'll even make a bear turn into a human.

1401
00:49:48,578 --> 00:49:50,378
I love how passionate you are.

1402
00:49:50,778 --> 00:49:51,938
Is it good?

1403
00:49:52,438 --> 00:49:53,878
It must be tasty.

1404
00:49:55,978 --> 00:49:57,778
(How about a well-being, ssam burger as a snack for today?)

1405
00:49:57,778 --> 00:49:58,878
She eats it well.

1406
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:01,208
She fails the mission.

1407
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:02,808
(So Min is out.)

1408
00:50:03,108 --> 00:50:06,178
The second round of Ssam My Way is called Ssam Says.

1409
00:50:06,438 --> 00:50:07,538
Ready, go.

1410
00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:09,878
Grab a lettuce,

1411
00:50:09,878 --> 00:50:11,478
and put a perilla leaf and chicory on top.

1412
00:50:11,478 --> 00:50:14,738
Make a nice ssam with ingredients except for raw garlic.

1413
00:50:14,738 --> 00:50:16,878
Show me the ingredients I've mentioned in your ssam.

1414
00:50:16,878 --> 00:50:18,838
- All right. - Lettuce, perilla leaf...

1415
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:19,938
(Will Se Chan win first place and acquire a hint?)

1416
00:50:19,938 --> 00:50:21,508
- It's difficult. - I don't have it.

1417
00:50:21,508 --> 00:50:23,408
- I only have two of them. - She's out.

1418
00:50:23,508 --> 00:50:25,308
Then Se Chan is the only one to clear the mission.

1419
00:50:25,308 --> 00:50:26,338
Okay!

1420
00:50:26,338 --> 00:50:27,438
(Sheriff Se Chan wins first place.)

1421
00:50:27,438 --> 00:50:28,578
It's amazing.

1422
00:50:28,578 --> 00:50:30,708
It was grilled onions, not garlic.

1423
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:32,778
(He gets to receive a hint.)

1424
00:50:33,278 --> 00:50:35,308
It'd be the best if he's the sheriff.

1425
00:50:37,708 --> 00:50:39,338
It'd be the best if he's the sheriff.

1426
00:50:39,438 --> 00:50:40,808
(Anxious)

1427
00:50:40,808 --> 00:50:43,138
Think about what I've done so far.

1428
00:50:43,138 --> 00:50:45,308
- Can I have it now? - He might be the thief.

1429
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,978
- You can't share it with us, right? - He can't.

1430
00:50:48,508 --> 00:50:50,038
Let us know though.

1431
00:50:50,978 --> 00:50:52,708
- What? - Share it with us.

1432
00:50:52,878 --> 00:50:55,638
Share it with someone you can really trust.

1433
00:50:55,778 --> 00:50:57,178
Can I read it now?

1434
00:50:57,308 --> 00:50:59,578
It has to be destroyed 30 seconds after you read it.

1435
00:50:59,578 --> 00:51:00,608
My goodness.

1436
00:51:00,608 --> 00:51:02,078
(The hint will be destroyed 30 seconds after he reads it.)

1437
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:04,278
(Se Chan knows all the hints which came out so far.)

1438
00:51:04,278 --> 00:51:05,408
Se Chan, you're awesome.

1439
00:51:06,338 --> 00:51:09,008
It's strange how Se Chan gets all the hints.

1440
00:51:09,008 --> 00:51:10,638
(He can't share the hint because no one can be trusted.)

1441
00:51:10,938 --> 00:51:12,338
I'll read it at the back.

1442
00:51:12,338 --> 00:51:13,578
(He can't share the hint because no one can be trusted.)

1443
00:51:15,078 --> 00:51:17,208
It was so close.

1444
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:19,208
It was the chance to win first place.

1445
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:22,078
(What's the last hint about?)

1446
00:51:24,938 --> 00:51:28,878
(Thieves are very talkative.)

1447
00:51:29,438 --> 00:51:33,208
(He also obtained another hint.)

1448
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:35,078
(One of the thieves...)

1449
00:51:35,078 --> 00:51:37,278
(is married.)

1450
00:51:37,278 --> 00:51:39,138
One of them is married.

1451
00:51:39,978 --> 00:51:40,978
One of them.

1452
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:46,678
(Is it Jae Seok or Haha?)

1453
00:51:46,678 --> 00:51:50,308
(If the other thief is not married,)

1454
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:54,378
(is it Kwang Soo or So Min who are both talkative?)

1455
00:51:54,378 --> 00:51:57,938
(It's been narrowed down. Thieves, you'll be caught soon.)

1456
00:51:58,838 --> 00:52:01,378
(Place for the last race)

1457
00:52:02,378 --> 00:52:03,408
What's in here?

1458
00:52:04,938 --> 00:52:05,938
What's this?

1459
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:10,338
(It's a courtroom.)

1460
00:52:12,138 --> 00:52:13,178
What's this?

1461
00:52:13,438 --> 00:52:14,478
What's going on?

1462
00:52:15,378 --> 00:52:16,938
Is it about telling the truth?

1463
00:52:17,338 --> 00:52:19,508
- It's a courtroom. - It is.

1464
00:52:19,778 --> 00:52:20,908
It looks amazing.

1465
00:52:21,378 --> 00:52:22,378
It's a trial.

1466
00:52:22,678 --> 00:52:23,978
This mission...

1467
00:52:24,378 --> 00:52:26,838
is the last chance to identify the thieves.

1468
00:52:26,838 --> 00:52:29,578
It's called Judgment Day.

1469
00:52:29,578 --> 00:52:32,178
(Judgment Day)

1470
00:52:34,078 --> 00:52:37,878
(It's Judgment Day?)

1471
00:52:37,878 --> 00:52:39,278
Inside this building,

1472
00:52:39,278 --> 00:52:43,038
hints related to the thieves and the sheriff are hidden.

1473
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:45,408
Find the hints...

1474
00:52:45,408 --> 00:52:47,608
and figure out who the thieves and the sheriff may be.

1475
00:52:47,608 --> 00:52:49,808
There will be a trial every 30 minutes...

1476
00:52:49,808 --> 00:52:52,078
during which you can identify the thieves.

1477
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:53,438
We must find proof.

1478
00:52:55,178 --> 00:52:57,878
The civilians should work together.

1479
00:52:57,878 --> 00:53:01,138
(He claps.)

1480
00:53:01,138 --> 00:53:02,408
What was that?

1481
00:53:02,508 --> 00:53:03,778
What was that?

1482
00:53:03,878 --> 00:53:06,838
- Wait a minute. - Why are you putting on an act?

1483
00:53:06,838 --> 00:53:08,778
May I suspect someone before we start?

1484
00:53:08,778 --> 00:53:09,938
He's so strange.

1485
00:53:09,938 --> 00:53:11,308
(Why are you so awkward?)

1486
00:53:11,308 --> 00:53:13,178
You're so cute today, Jae Seok.

1487
00:53:13,178 --> 00:53:14,938
I know you feel impatient.

1488
00:53:14,938 --> 00:53:17,678
- Wait a little longer. - If you get identified so quickly,

1489
00:53:17,678 --> 00:53:20,578
wouldn't the other thief be nervous?

1490
00:53:20,608 --> 00:53:22,978
So Min will start to get nervous.

1491
00:53:24,038 --> 00:53:26,878
(Jae Seok looks suspicious.)

1492
00:53:26,878 --> 00:53:28,878
(Is he really a thief?)

1493
00:53:28,878 --> 00:53:30,478
Let's start. We'll figure it out when we get the hints.

1494
00:53:30,478 --> 00:53:32,778
You'll start at different places.

1495
00:53:32,778 --> 00:53:35,208
- Please go to your places. - Let's go.

1496
00:53:35,978 --> 00:53:37,908
Let's eliminate Seok Jin first.

1497
00:53:38,578 --> 00:53:40,038
- We'll start with you. - No.

1498
00:53:40,038 --> 00:53:41,408
(Who will be on trial 30 minutes later?)

1499
00:53:41,678 --> 00:53:42,938
Are you not a thief?

1500
00:53:43,478 --> 00:53:45,178
Are you really not?

1501
00:53:45,178 --> 00:53:47,208
- I'm not. - I think it's you.

1502
00:53:47,208 --> 00:53:48,208
Why?

1503
00:53:48,608 --> 00:53:50,178
- Is it because you're a thief? - It can't be Seok Jin.

1504
00:53:50,178 --> 00:53:51,438
- Is that why? - No.

1505
00:53:51,438 --> 00:53:53,308
- Listen to her. - What did she say?

1506
00:53:53,308 --> 00:53:55,708
She suspects that I'm a thief.

1507
00:53:55,708 --> 00:53:56,878
- So Min does? - Yes.

1508
00:53:56,878 --> 00:53:59,278
- She suspected everyone. - Do you know why?

1509
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:00,608
It's because she's a thief.

1510
00:54:00,608 --> 00:54:01,678
I think she is.

1511
00:54:01,678 --> 00:54:02,678
I'm the sheriff.

1512
00:54:02,678 --> 00:54:03,878
- It's unfortunate. - What?

1513
00:54:03,878 --> 00:54:05,608
- I'm the sheriff. - That also sounds strange.

1514
00:54:05,608 --> 00:54:07,178
- It sounds strange. - Are you the sheriff?

1515
00:54:07,438 --> 00:54:10,408
- That makes no sense. - If you are, you must tell us.

1516
00:54:10,478 --> 00:54:12,338
- Yes, I'm the sheriff. - We have to protect you.

1517
00:54:12,338 --> 00:54:13,708
We have to protect her.

1518
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,678
This isn't Name Tag Elimination.

1519
00:54:15,678 --> 00:54:16,878
We have to find the hints.

1520
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:19,778
Once we find them, we'll figure out together.

1521
00:54:19,878 --> 00:54:21,578
We must remember this.

1522
00:54:21,578 --> 00:54:24,408
The civilians must...

1523
00:54:24,778 --> 00:54:27,278
come together to identify the thieves.

1524
00:54:27,338 --> 00:54:28,608
Protect me since I'm the sheriff.

1525
00:54:28,608 --> 00:54:30,038
- I'm also a civilian. - I'm sure.

1526
00:54:30,038 --> 00:54:31,038
I'm quite sure.

1527
00:54:32,778 --> 00:54:34,838
- Here's a thief. - What is this?

1528
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:36,608
(Running)

1529
00:54:36,608 --> 00:54:38,608
- It's a thief. - Come on.

1530
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,078
(They exclude the prime suspect.)

1531
00:54:40,078 --> 00:54:41,538
- Go away. - We won't include you.

1532
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:42,978
We won't include you.

1533
00:54:42,978 --> 00:54:43,978
Brave civilians.

1534
00:54:43,978 --> 00:54:46,208
(Let's come together.)

1535
00:54:46,208 --> 00:54:47,838
(That includes me.)

1536
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:51,038
Civilians, do not be confused.

1537
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:52,038
(The civilians disperse.)

1538
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,608
Honestly speaking,

1539
00:54:54,138 --> 00:54:55,738
- Haha is suspicious. - Please press three.

1540
00:54:56,438 --> 00:54:57,578
Haha is suspicious.

1541
00:54:57,578 --> 00:54:59,208
- He's also suspicious. - It's difficult.

1542
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:00,838
- It's difficult. - He really is.

1543
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:01,938
It's strange.

1544
00:55:01,938 --> 00:55:03,478
He's too suspicious.

1545
00:55:03,478 --> 00:55:05,278
This isn't Name Tag Elimination.

1546
00:55:05,678 --> 00:55:06,708
Third floor.

1547
00:55:06,708 --> 00:55:08,078
- We have to get off. - Second floor.

1548
00:55:08,078 --> 00:55:09,708
We're having an important conversation.

1549
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:12,978
I don't believe this.

1550
00:55:13,278 --> 00:55:14,938
- Kwang Soo. - I was saying...

1551
00:55:14,938 --> 00:55:16,838
- Get off the elevator. - Get off.

1552
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:20,108
- Get off. So Min. - I'm getting off.

1553
00:55:20,138 --> 00:55:21,608
- See you later, So Min. - See you later.

1554
00:55:21,608 --> 00:55:23,378
- See you. - I'm a civilian.

1555
00:55:23,378 --> 00:55:25,078
You said you're the sheriff earlier.

1556
00:55:25,078 --> 00:55:27,208
- Civilian. - You said you're the sheriff.

1557
00:55:27,308 --> 00:55:28,338
Haha is suspicious.

1558
00:55:28,338 --> 00:55:29,708
- He is. - He really is.

1559
00:55:29,708 --> 00:55:31,478
- I'm a civilian. - He overreacts.

1560
00:55:31,978 --> 00:55:32,978
- You know? - Yes.

1561
00:55:32,978 --> 00:55:35,508
The phone call at the restaurant was too much.

1562
00:55:35,508 --> 00:55:37,208
Do you realize that I'm not a thief?

1563
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,508
- You could be the sheriff. - I'm not sure.

1564
00:55:38,508 --> 00:55:39,778
- I'll protect you. - You...

1565
00:55:39,778 --> 00:55:41,278
- I'll protect you. - have to be protected.

1566
00:55:41,278 --> 00:55:42,308
(He suspects So Min.)

1567
00:55:42,308 --> 00:55:43,908
Don't do anything to me if you're a thief.

1568
00:55:45,038 --> 00:55:46,738
Don't do anything to me.

1569
00:55:47,008 --> 00:55:48,608
I'll be disappointed if you do.

1570
00:55:49,478 --> 00:55:50,478
(The real sheriff appears.)

1571
00:55:50,478 --> 00:55:52,208
Are you filming me?

1572
00:55:52,878 --> 00:55:53,908
What's going on?

1573
00:55:55,308 --> 00:55:57,438
(A moving camera follows him.)

1574
00:55:57,438 --> 00:56:00,408
(He feels happy to be the sheriff.)

1575
00:56:01,578 --> 00:56:03,938
Here are the rules.

1576
00:56:04,438 --> 00:56:08,778
This is how the sheriff can eliminate others secretly.

1577
00:56:08,778 --> 00:56:13,208
(How the sheriff can eliminate others secretly)

1578
00:56:13,408 --> 00:56:14,878
You may eliminate others...

1579
00:56:14,878 --> 00:56:16,508
(Dear Sheriff)

1580
00:56:16,508 --> 00:56:17,678
with a water gun.

1581
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:18,708
A water gun?

1582
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,278
(Shoot the water gun.)

1583
00:56:20,408 --> 00:56:21,408
(The water gun is loaded with blue paint.)

1584
00:56:21,408 --> 00:56:25,478
Shoot the water gun at the member's name tag.

1585
00:56:25,678 --> 00:56:29,578
Then rip off the name tag to eliminate him or her.

1586
00:56:29,578 --> 00:56:31,508
(He must shoot and take off the name tag.)

1587
00:56:31,508 --> 00:56:32,708
This'll be hard.

1588
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:37,208
(Arrest the thieves by shooting blue paint water gun.)

1589
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:38,508
(Sheriff)

1590
00:56:38,508 --> 00:56:40,578
This is amazing. Put it on neatly.

1591
00:56:40,578 --> 00:56:42,438
When someone asks who the sheriff is,

1592
00:56:42,438 --> 00:56:45,178
I'll appear all of a sudden.

1593
00:56:45,178 --> 00:56:47,578
(I'm the sheriff.)

1594
00:56:47,578 --> 00:56:50,138
I'm nervous as I'm given an important task.

1595
00:56:50,138 --> 00:56:52,308
(This is Sheriff Yang who will protect the civilians.)

1596
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:55,078
I'm nervous since I'm in the spotlight today.

1597
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,078
I'm nervous.

1598
00:56:56,078 --> 00:56:58,938
(Rest assured, Civilians.)

1599
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:03,338
The game will be boring since Jae Seok is acting too obvious.

1600
00:57:03,338 --> 00:57:06,278
Everyone in my car suspected Jae Seok.

1601
00:57:07,078 --> 00:57:09,678
He'll give up soon.

1602
00:57:09,678 --> 00:57:11,838
The unlucky thief may be single.

1603
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:13,038
It could be Kwang Soo.

1604
00:57:13,578 --> 00:57:16,578
Could the unlucky thief be Haha?

1605
00:57:17,378 --> 00:57:19,478
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo. Ji Hyo is suspicious.

1606
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:21,178
How can she say 6 times 5 is 15?

1607
00:57:21,178 --> 00:57:22,938
(He calculates the probability.)

1608
00:57:22,938 --> 00:57:23,978
Whatever.

1609
00:57:24,378 --> 00:57:27,308
I don't know what I'm doing right now.

1610
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:29,978
I don't know. It's not me anyway.

1611
00:57:29,978 --> 00:57:32,008
I'm just a good civilian.

1612
00:57:33,138 --> 00:57:34,938
(Seok Jin is a civilian.)

1613
00:57:34,938 --> 00:57:38,108
See? I'm a civilian.

1614
00:57:38,878 --> 00:57:41,278
Jae Seok is definitely a thief.

1615
00:57:41,878 --> 00:57:43,478
It could also be So Min.

1616
00:57:43,478 --> 00:57:45,378
(So Min?)

1617
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,978
I think it may be Se Chan.

1618
00:57:49,278 --> 00:57:51,738
I have no idea who the sheriff is.

1619
00:57:52,308 --> 00:57:54,308
I'm definitely a civilian.

1620
00:57:54,578 --> 00:57:56,808
I'm bad at multiplication tables.

1621
00:57:57,208 --> 00:57:58,278
I made a mistake.

1622
00:57:58,278 --> 00:57:59,508
(That's a misunderstanding.)

1623
00:57:59,508 --> 00:58:02,478
I'm sorry. My mind was somewhere else.

1624
00:58:03,178 --> 00:58:05,678
(Ji Hyo is also a civilian.)

1625
00:58:07,038 --> 00:58:10,038
(The suspects are narrowed down to 5 people.)

1626
00:58:10,038 --> 00:58:12,008
I'm sure Se Chan is a civilian.

1627
00:58:12,778 --> 00:58:14,738
I think Seok Jin is also a civilian.

1628
00:58:17,438 --> 00:58:18,608
So Min is...

1629
00:58:18,608 --> 00:58:21,138
(However, So Min is...)

1630
00:58:21,138 --> 00:58:22,438
I have no idea who she is.

1631
00:58:22,438 --> 00:58:24,038
I don't understand her as a person.

1632
00:58:24,978 --> 00:58:26,878
The more I get to know her, the less I understand.

1633
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,278
(Who is she?)

1634
00:58:28,278 --> 00:58:30,978
(So Min is...)

1635
00:58:30,978 --> 00:58:32,308
(moving about.)

1636
00:58:33,678 --> 00:58:35,178
Why do you keep filming me?

1637
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,278
(She likes to avoid the camera.)

1638
00:58:36,878 --> 00:58:39,478
Are the hints in an envelope?

1639
00:58:39,478 --> 00:58:41,138
Or is it a flag?

1640
00:58:41,678 --> 00:58:43,438
(Where are they?)

1641
00:58:43,438 --> 00:58:45,808
They aren't easily visible, are they?

1642
00:58:46,178 --> 00:58:47,408
Are they hard to find?

1643
00:58:47,408 --> 00:58:48,678
(They must be hidden well.)

1644
00:58:48,778 --> 00:58:54,308
(What is the identity of So Min?)

1645
00:58:54,611 --> 00:58:57,381
The race will start now.

1646
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:58,951
Five.

1647
00:58:59,211 --> 00:59:03,011
4, 3, 2, 1.

1648
00:59:03,251 --> 00:59:04,781
The race starts.

1649
00:59:04,951 --> 00:59:07,681
All right. Let's go.

1650
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:09,181
Okay.

1651
00:59:10,281 --> 00:59:12,081
I have to find the hints.

1652
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:15,451
(Looking through)

1653
00:59:16,851 --> 00:59:17,881
Where are they?

1654
00:59:17,881 --> 00:59:19,151
(They must find the hints first.)

1655
00:59:19,151 --> 00:59:20,351
Goodness. This race...

1656
00:59:21,611 --> 00:59:23,751
Let's get it over with.

1657
00:59:23,751 --> 00:59:25,251
I can't do it any longer.

1658
00:59:25,251 --> 00:59:26,581
- Se Chan. - Where are you going?

1659
00:59:26,581 --> 00:59:27,751
- Did you find anything? - I'm still looking.

1660
00:59:27,751 --> 00:59:29,611
(Haha appears.)

1661
00:59:29,611 --> 00:59:30,611
I'm looking.

1662
00:59:30,611 --> 00:59:31,851
(They look at each other.)

1663
00:59:31,851 --> 00:59:32,851
(He senses something.)

1664
00:59:32,851 --> 00:59:34,751
- Se Chan, what are you doing? - What?

1665
00:59:34,751 --> 00:59:35,811
What's wrong?

1666
00:59:36,051 --> 00:59:37,711
Stop it. I'm looking.

1667
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:40,011
Your facial expression.

1668
00:59:41,111 --> 00:59:42,781
- Haha. - Your behavior.

1669
00:59:42,781 --> 00:59:44,481
- What are you? - Listen.

1670
00:59:45,151 --> 00:59:47,611
We'll protect you since you're a civilian.

1671
00:59:47,611 --> 00:59:49,511
Tell me who the thieves are. Just name one.

1672
00:59:49,951 --> 00:59:51,211
I know one of them.

1673
00:59:51,211 --> 00:59:52,211
Jae Seok?

1674
00:59:52,351 --> 00:59:54,551
Who protects Jae Seok the most?

1675
00:59:54,611 --> 00:59:56,911
Who is the one that protects Jae Seok the most?

1676
00:59:56,951 --> 00:59:58,081
You'll find out soon.

1677
00:59:58,881 --> 00:59:59,951
Who could it be?

1678
01:00:00,111 --> 01:00:01,281
- Good luck. - Thank you.

1679
01:00:02,011 --> 01:00:03,451
If you're the sheriff...

1680
01:00:03,451 --> 01:00:07,951
(If you're the sheriff...)

1681
01:00:08,851 --> 01:00:10,751
(If I'm the sheriff?)

1682
01:00:10,751 --> 01:00:11,781
I'll still protect you.

1683
01:00:11,781 --> 01:00:12,851
(I'll still protect you.)

1684
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,751
(He'll still protect me?)

1685
01:00:15,751 --> 01:00:16,751
What are you?

1686
01:00:16,751 --> 01:00:18,711
(What are you?)

1687
01:00:19,251 --> 01:00:20,981
Who are you?

1688
01:00:21,381 --> 01:00:23,511
- Who are you to protect me? - Me?

1689
01:00:23,851 --> 01:00:24,851
- Who are you? - Se Chan.

1690
01:00:24,851 --> 01:00:26,181
You punk.

1691
01:00:26,251 --> 01:00:27,751
I said I'll protect you.

1692
01:00:27,751 --> 01:00:30,611
You're the sheriff of Mapo.

1693
01:00:30,751 --> 01:00:32,251
- What? - I'll protect you.

1694
01:00:32,251 --> 01:00:33,381
Who am I?

1695
01:00:33,381 --> 01:00:35,981
- Who are you to protect me? - Didn't I sound cool?

1696
01:00:35,981 --> 01:00:38,111
You did at first, but now that I think of it,

1697
01:00:38,381 --> 01:00:40,111
who are you to protect me?

1698
01:00:40,111 --> 01:00:41,211
(Who are you, Haha?)

1699
01:00:41,211 --> 01:00:43,151
See you later.

1700
01:00:43,151 --> 01:00:45,051
Something amazing will happen in 30 minutes.

1701
01:00:45,251 --> 01:00:46,981
We will get so much air time this week.

1702
01:00:47,251 --> 01:00:49,551
- Just wait and see. - I don't know what Haha is.

1703
01:00:49,781 --> 01:00:50,851
I don't.

1704
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,151
"What are you?"

1705
01:00:53,381 --> 01:00:54,551
I got flustered.

1706
01:00:56,511 --> 01:00:58,281
Haha...

1707
01:00:58,981 --> 01:01:00,781
I'm bothered by him.

1708
01:01:03,751 --> 01:01:04,781
This is funny.

1709
01:01:04,781 --> 01:01:06,581
(Does Haha really know something?)

1710
01:01:07,251 --> 01:01:09,381
- Hello, Seok Jin. - So Min.

1711
01:01:09,381 --> 01:01:10,781
You're in danger right now.

1712
01:01:10,981 --> 01:01:12,011
Why?

1713
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:14,151
You'll be mentioned at the trial.

1714
01:01:14,511 --> 01:01:16,481
- Me? - Yes, I'm giving you information.

1715
01:01:18,011 --> 01:01:19,481
I'm a civilian.

1716
01:01:20,081 --> 01:01:21,351
Who do you think it is then?

1717
01:01:22,081 --> 01:01:23,151
Me?

1718
01:01:23,151 --> 01:01:24,181
(She approaches Seok Jin.)

1719
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:25,251
I think it's Jong Kook.

1720
01:01:25,251 --> 01:01:26,581
(She approaches Seok Jin.)

1721
01:01:26,581 --> 01:01:27,981
(She slides in.)

1722
01:01:28,481 --> 01:01:29,851
I didn't find anything. I'm clean.

1723
01:01:30,251 --> 01:01:32,011
What are you doing?

1724
01:01:32,581 --> 01:01:34,011
You look so natural.

1725
01:01:34,211 --> 01:01:36,011
- What are you doing? - Let me see it once.

1726
01:01:36,111 --> 01:01:37,311
There's nothing in it.

1727
01:01:37,311 --> 01:01:38,451
You wrote something down.

1728
01:01:38,551 --> 01:01:39,911
- Just once. - There's nothing.

1729
01:01:40,151 --> 01:01:42,351
- What are you doing, by the way? - You wrote something down.

1730
01:01:43,351 --> 01:01:44,481
Can you show it to me?

1731
01:01:44,481 --> 01:01:46,751
You're not supposed to show it to each other.

1732
01:01:46,751 --> 01:01:48,751
- Can you show it to me once? - I found it.

1733
01:01:48,751 --> 01:01:50,811
I looked everywhere and found nothing.

1734
01:01:50,811 --> 01:01:52,381
I'll tell you.

1735
01:01:53,351 --> 01:01:54,511
"There is a big difference in height."

1736
01:01:54,511 --> 01:01:56,511
(He just says something random.)

1737
01:01:56,581 --> 01:01:58,251
- Height? Between two people? - Yes.

1738
01:01:58,251 --> 01:01:59,611
- Between two people? - Their height is largely different.

1739
01:02:00,011 --> 01:02:02,251
It's Kwang Soo.

1740
01:02:02,481 --> 01:02:04,151
It's Kwang Soo and Haha.

1741
01:02:04,311 --> 01:02:07,051
It has to be Kwang Soo and Haha.

1742
01:02:07,051 --> 01:02:08,751
(Does she really believe me?)

1743
01:02:08,781 --> 01:02:10,451
Don't they look like the thieves from "Home Alone"?

1744
01:02:10,451 --> 01:02:12,051
Yes, It's Kwang Soo and Haha.

1745
01:02:12,511 --> 01:02:15,811
(Thieves Among Us)

1746
01:02:17,351 --> 01:02:18,481
Kwang Soo.

1747
01:02:18,481 --> 01:02:20,651
What is it? What were you laughing about?

1748
01:02:20,781 --> 01:02:22,081
It's nothing. It was just funny.

1749
01:02:22,081 --> 01:02:24,381
(They bump into each other in a secluded area.)

1750
01:02:25,511 --> 01:02:27,481
- I should try here. - What?

1751
01:02:27,581 --> 01:02:28,751
- I should look here. - I think...

1752
01:02:29,381 --> 01:02:32,211
it's you and Jong Kook, or Jong Kook and Jae Seok.

1753
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:33,651
I think it's Jae Seok too.

1754
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:36,351
Jae Seok and Jong Kook.

1755
01:02:37,111 --> 01:02:39,181
- Let's look some more. - What if we do Jong Kook first?

1756
01:02:39,181 --> 01:02:41,551
- I like that idea. - Me too. I made up my mind.

1757
01:02:41,551 --> 01:02:42,681
I think it's Jong Kook.

1758
01:02:43,451 --> 01:02:45,711
- I think the culprit... - Civilian Song Ji Hyo is out.

1759
01:02:46,081 --> 01:02:47,811
Civilian Song Ji Hyo is out.

1760
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:53,681
(Ji Hyo is out?)

1761
01:02:53,681 --> 01:02:55,881
The thief eliminated an innocent civilian.

1762
01:02:55,881 --> 01:02:58,181
(You can get eliminated from this game?)

1763
01:02:59,251 --> 01:03:01,251
Civilian Song Ji Hyo is out.

1764
01:03:01,351 --> 01:03:02,481
What?

1765
01:03:02,481 --> 01:03:03,751
(They are in panic mode over the announcement.)

1766
01:03:03,751 --> 01:03:06,151
The thief eliminated an innocent civilian.

1767
01:03:06,211 --> 01:03:08,081
Here's a hint about the thief.

1768
01:03:08,081 --> 01:03:09,351
(How, when, and who eliminated a civilian?)

1769
01:03:09,351 --> 01:03:10,651
(A hint is released about the thief for killing a civilian.)

1770
01:03:10,651 --> 01:03:11,981
- A hint about the thief? - They're giving us a hint.

1771
01:03:11,981 --> 01:03:14,351
- What is it? - It's a hint. Hold up.

1772
01:03:14,481 --> 01:03:15,551
Listen carefully.

1773
01:03:16,081 --> 01:03:17,951
Here's a hint about the thief.

1774
01:03:18,381 --> 01:03:21,651
Thief A has the letter S in their name.

1775
01:03:21,651 --> 01:03:24,581
(Here's the hint.)

1776
01:03:24,981 --> 01:03:26,851
Thief A has the letter S in the name?

1777
01:03:27,481 --> 01:03:28,581
Lee Kwang Soo.

1778
01:03:29,281 --> 01:03:30,551
Jee Seok Jin.

1779
01:03:30,551 --> 01:03:32,181
(Jee Seok Jin?)

1780
01:03:33,081 --> 01:03:34,481
(Is it you?)

1781
01:03:34,481 --> 01:03:35,511
Hold on.

1782
01:03:35,581 --> 01:03:36,981
The fact that she's out means...

1783
01:03:39,181 --> 01:03:40,551
How do you eliminate somebody?

1784
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:42,911
Why did she get eliminated all of a sudden?

1785
01:03:43,011 --> 01:03:44,951
I'm scared right now. Don't come near me.

1786
01:03:45,011 --> 01:03:47,051
- Don't come near me. - I'm scared of your eyes.

1787
01:03:47,051 --> 01:03:49,051
No. Why are you coming closer?

1788
01:03:49,281 --> 01:03:51,311
Why are you coming closer? Don't come.

1789
01:03:51,381 --> 01:03:54,511
The trial will begin in one minute.

1790
01:03:54,551 --> 01:03:56,811
- Please assemble. - It's hot.

1791
01:03:57,751 --> 01:03:59,811
(Will the truth be revealed at the court?)

1792
01:03:59,811 --> 01:04:01,251
She's so scary.

1793
01:04:02,811 --> 01:04:04,251
I'm getting scared of him.

1794
01:04:07,981 --> 01:04:09,211
There's an S?

1795
01:04:09,211 --> 01:04:10,481
(Thinking)

1796
01:04:10,481 --> 01:04:12,051
There's an S. So Min,

1797
01:04:12,781 --> 01:04:13,881
Jae Seok,

1798
01:04:14,481 --> 01:04:15,581
Seok Jin...

1799
01:04:15,581 --> 01:04:19,181
(He lists all the S's.)

1800
01:04:19,181 --> 01:04:20,251
Kwang Soo...

1801
01:04:20,581 --> 01:04:22,311
I don't think you rip off the name tag.

1802
01:04:22,381 --> 01:04:23,981
- What? - I don't think it's the name tags.

1803
01:04:24,381 --> 01:04:25,481
I don't think so either.

1804
01:04:25,551 --> 01:04:26,781
- What? - What is it?

1805
01:04:28,181 --> 01:04:29,351
What?

1806
01:04:29,351 --> 01:04:31,551
(Why is he surprised at Seok Jin?)

1807
01:04:31,981 --> 01:04:33,181
- What is this? - What?

1808
01:04:33,181 --> 01:04:35,711
(What's going on with Seok Jin?)

1809
01:04:35,711 --> 01:04:36,911
What's wrong?

1810
01:04:37,811 --> 01:04:39,011
What is it?

1811
01:04:39,011 --> 01:04:40,051
Hold on.

1812
01:04:42,581 --> 01:04:45,451
- What? - You got shot by a water gun.

1813
01:04:46,311 --> 01:04:49,151
(He got shot by a water gun?)

1814
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,751
(I got shot by a water gun?)

1815
01:04:50,751 --> 01:04:51,951
- I did? - Yes.

1816
01:04:52,311 --> 01:04:53,551
What color is it?

1817
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:54,781
It's pink.

1818
01:04:54,781 --> 01:04:57,111
(There's a pink stain on Seok Jin's name tag.)

1819
01:04:57,111 --> 01:05:02,281
(It's different from Se Chan's blue paint.)

1820
01:05:02,851 --> 01:05:04,381
I got shot by a water gun?

1821
01:05:04,551 --> 01:05:05,711
I think you're out.

1822
01:05:06,451 --> 01:05:07,481
I'll get going.

1823
01:05:07,851 --> 01:05:09,381
I have to survive. I'm sorry.

1824
01:05:09,711 --> 01:05:11,751
- I have to go. I'm sorry. - I mean...

1825
01:05:11,751 --> 01:05:13,981
- I might get infected. - Is there a mirror?

1826
01:05:14,381 --> 01:05:16,381
- Who shot the water gun? - It's a water gun.

1827
01:05:16,381 --> 01:05:17,811
Did you do it?

1828
01:05:17,811 --> 01:05:20,381
- How's that possible? - You were here for a while.

1829
01:05:20,511 --> 01:05:22,951
- Let me check. Be honest. - I don't have anything.

1830
01:05:22,951 --> 01:05:25,011
- Didn't you shoot it? - I can't get infected.

1831
01:05:25,011 --> 01:05:26,911
- Kwang Soo. - You've been infected.

1832
01:05:26,911 --> 01:05:29,781
- It could have been you. - It's not me.

1833
01:05:29,881 --> 01:05:30,981
Who did you meet before me?

1834
01:05:32,181 --> 01:05:34,111
(Who did he meet before Kwang Soo?)

1835
01:05:34,111 --> 01:05:35,181
So Min,

1836
01:05:36,611 --> 01:05:37,711
Jae Seok...

1837
01:05:39,351 --> 01:05:40,681
- Did you find something? - Did you find anything?

1838
01:05:40,681 --> 01:05:42,051
There's nothing.

1839
01:05:42,051 --> 01:05:43,881
Tell me what's going on. I have no idea.

1840
01:05:43,911 --> 01:05:46,311
I'm looking for a hint, but there aren't any.

1841
01:05:46,311 --> 01:05:47,981
(Hold on.)

1842
01:05:47,981 --> 01:05:50,451
I just saw it.

1843
01:05:50,551 --> 01:05:52,451
I have a good eye.

1844
01:05:53,011 --> 01:05:54,581
I think Jae Seok has a water gun too.

1845
01:05:54,581 --> 01:05:57,351
(He's 200 percent sure.)

1846
01:05:58,211 --> 01:06:00,711
(A short while ago, in front of the elevator)

1847
01:06:00,711 --> 01:06:01,751
Are you going down?

1848
01:06:01,751 --> 01:06:03,751
(Jae Seok was spotted by Sheriff Yang.)

1849
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:07,181
- I'm going to check downstairs. - Okay.

1850
01:06:07,181 --> 01:06:09,911
(Wait. What's that?)

1851
01:06:09,911 --> 01:06:13,311
(Is that a pink stain on Jae Seok's shirt?)

1852
01:06:13,311 --> 01:06:15,581
(Everything is pointing towards Jae Seok.)

1853
01:06:15,581 --> 01:06:16,681
All right.

1854
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,281
(He's onto Jae Seok.)

1855
01:06:18,281 --> 01:06:19,381
I'll go around.

1856
01:06:20,081 --> 01:06:21,911
I'll go around. There's no hint here.

1857
01:06:22,781 --> 01:06:24,151
Jae Seok, gosh.

1858
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:27,381
(Jae Seok has been acting strange all day.)

1859
01:06:27,381 --> 01:06:28,651
(He's going to meet him.)

1860
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:31,581
Here's an announcement.

1861
01:06:31,751 --> 01:06:34,311
- Please listen up. - What were they saying earlier?

1862
01:06:34,311 --> 01:06:35,581
(This looks like a natural encounter.)

1863
01:06:35,581 --> 01:06:37,551
- What? - What letter was it?

1864
01:06:37,551 --> 01:06:38,681
An S?

1865
01:06:40,381 --> 01:06:42,881
I didn't find anything.

1866
01:06:43,051 --> 01:06:44,311
- Did you find anything? - Nothing.

1867
01:06:48,151 --> 01:06:49,251
How long is a minute?

1868
01:06:49,251 --> 01:06:53,551
(He looks for a good timing...)

1869
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:55,811
(and spots Jae Seok's back.)

1870
01:06:56,751 --> 01:06:57,911
We didn't see here.

1871
01:06:58,011 --> 01:06:59,381
- Should we look here? - Okay.

1872
01:07:00,811 --> 01:07:04,211
(He makes it look like he's looking for a hint.)

1873
01:07:04,211 --> 01:07:06,181
(He loads the blue water gun.)

1874
01:07:06,181 --> 01:07:07,211
(Spraying)

1875
01:07:07,711 --> 01:07:13,381
(Jae Seok is shot.)

1876
01:07:15,951 --> 01:07:17,251
- We didn't look here. - Exactly.

1877
01:07:17,251 --> 01:07:19,381
(He just has to rip off Jae Seok's name tag now.)

1878
01:07:24,051 --> 01:07:25,111
I have to hide it again.

1879
01:07:26,111 --> 01:07:28,311
Time is up. Please head towards the court.

1880
01:07:28,311 --> 01:07:30,451
(He hides the evidence.)

1881
01:07:30,451 --> 01:07:32,011
(He finally did it.)

1882
01:07:32,011 --> 01:07:33,451
Did you see that? That looked cool.

1883
01:07:34,481 --> 01:07:37,211
(30 minutes have passed. The 1st race is over.)

1884
01:07:37,211 --> 01:07:38,881
(This is where the trial will be held.)

1885
01:07:38,881 --> 01:07:40,751
Seok Jin. So Min is pink.

1886
01:07:40,851 --> 01:07:42,581
I'm right. It's her.

1887
01:07:42,581 --> 01:07:43,911
I'm going to say it.

1888
01:07:43,911 --> 01:07:44,911
(Even her shirt is pink.)

1889
01:07:44,911 --> 01:07:47,381
- It's not me. - You got shot.

1890
01:07:47,381 --> 01:07:49,181
I'm going to the restroom.

1891
01:07:49,181 --> 01:07:51,051
The water gun... Why are you going to the restroom?

1892
01:07:51,051 --> 01:07:52,151
- Where are you going? - I'll be right back.

1893
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:53,251
Are you filling up your water gun?

1894
01:07:53,251 --> 01:07:54,481
Are you hiding it?

1895
01:07:54,581 --> 01:07:56,381
We'll treat you to something nice after this.

1896
01:07:56,381 --> 01:07:57,611
I'm going to the restroom.

1897
01:07:57,751 --> 01:07:59,251
This is not fair. Where's the restroom?

1898
01:07:59,251 --> 01:08:00,521
It's not me.

1899
01:08:00,521 --> 01:08:01,781
Se Chan has it too.

1900
01:08:02,251 --> 01:08:05,381
Se Chan, you got shot too.

1901
01:08:05,851 --> 01:08:07,021
What?

1902
01:08:07,021 --> 01:08:09,311
(Why does Se Chan have a pink stain too?)

1903
01:08:09,311 --> 01:08:10,551
- Come here. - You got shot too.

1904
01:08:10,851 --> 01:08:11,911
Me?

1905
01:08:11,911 --> 01:08:14,881
(If the sheriff is out, the thief wins. Se Chan is in danger.)

1906
01:08:14,881 --> 01:08:18,521
(When did he get attacked?)

1907
01:08:18,981 --> 01:08:24,481
(During the past 30 minutes, Se Chan bumped into many people.)

1908
01:08:24,481 --> 01:08:26,051
(There's a thief among them.)

1909
01:08:26,051 --> 01:08:27,651
Did I get shot?

1910
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,811
Did I get shot?

1911
01:08:30,811 --> 01:08:33,381
(Will Sheriff Yang be able to catch the thieves?)

1912
01:08:34,181 --> 01:08:35,851
(It's the first trial.)

1913
01:08:35,851 --> 01:08:38,151
- I can't trust you. - You can.

1914
01:08:38,151 --> 01:08:40,881
- I'm being honest. - The thieves can lie.

1915
01:08:40,951 --> 01:08:43,481
I think you two will be eliminated soon.

1916
01:08:43,481 --> 01:08:45,551
(They both have water gun stains.)

1917
01:08:46,481 --> 01:08:49,751
- Can you leave a long testament? - Why?

1918
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:51,251
- No, look. - I think they'll be gone soon.

1919
01:08:51,251 --> 01:08:53,021
- He got shot. - Jae Seok, let me see your back.

1920
01:08:53,021 --> 01:08:54,251
- Let me see you. - Let's see.

1921
01:08:54,521 --> 01:08:58,151
- He has 2. - There are 2.

1922
01:08:58,151 --> 01:09:01,251
(There are two?)

1923
01:09:01,281 --> 01:09:02,481
- Let me see you. - Let's see.

1924
01:09:02,751 --> 01:09:04,451
- He has 2. - There are 2.

1925
01:09:04,451 --> 01:09:06,581
(He got shot twice?)

1926
01:09:06,581 --> 01:09:12,911
(There's the blue paint from Se Chan, and what's the other one?)

1927
01:09:12,911 --> 01:09:16,381
(Who shot the pink one?)

1928
01:09:16,381 --> 01:09:19,811
(Was it the thief? Then, Jae Seok is...)

1929
01:09:19,851 --> 01:09:21,711
- I got shot too? - You did.

1930
01:09:22,281 --> 01:09:25,451
You're a target too. This is getting confusing.

1931
01:09:25,451 --> 01:09:26,911
- I'm getting goosebumps. - I had no idea.

1932
01:09:28,681 --> 01:09:31,811
(Everything is still a mystery. First trial begins.)

1933
01:09:31,811 --> 01:09:33,181
Let me speak first.

1934
01:09:33,451 --> 01:09:35,151
So Min,

1935
01:09:35,151 --> 01:09:37,781
you tried to look.

1936
01:09:38,111 --> 01:09:42,051
You spun it around and tried to look at it.

1937
01:09:42,051 --> 01:09:44,981
Then, Kwang Soo was surprised by my name tag. Why?

1938
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:47,481
I got shot by the water gun.

1939
01:09:47,481 --> 01:09:49,211
(Did So Min do that?)

1940
01:09:49,281 --> 01:09:50,751
I got shot by the water gun.

1941
01:09:51,181 --> 01:09:52,851
What is the color of your shirt?

1942
01:09:52,851 --> 01:09:54,611
- It's pink. - What's this color?

1943
01:09:54,611 --> 01:09:56,211
It's pink. But it's not...

1944
01:09:56,211 --> 01:09:57,651
How long were you around me?

1945
01:09:58,021 --> 01:09:59,311
- Around 5 minutes? - It was around 5 minutes.

1946
01:09:59,311 --> 01:10:00,381
That's enough time.

1947
01:10:00,581 --> 01:10:01,611
That's it, everybody.

1948
01:10:02,251 --> 01:10:03,711
So Min...

1949
01:10:03,711 --> 01:10:04,811
(Seok Jin suspects So Min and she doesn't have an alibi.)

1950
01:10:05,081 --> 01:10:09,381
I bumped into So Min on the seventh floor.

1951
01:10:09,811 --> 01:10:12,851
With a blushed face, she said,

1952
01:10:13,451 --> 01:10:17,481
"Haha, I'm a civilian."

1953
01:10:17,581 --> 01:10:21,151
I instinctively turned my back towards the wall.

1954
01:10:21,451 --> 01:10:22,581
It was an instinct.

1955
01:10:22,581 --> 01:10:24,581
And then, I heard the announcement.

1956
01:10:24,781 --> 01:10:28,081
It was about the trial being held in one minute.

1957
01:10:28,081 --> 01:10:30,251
Suddenly, without thinking...

1958
01:10:30,251 --> 01:10:32,111
Without thinking, she asked the staff members.

1959
01:10:32,351 --> 01:10:34,311
"There's no name tag ripping on the way to the court, right?"

1960
01:10:35,981 --> 01:10:37,381
(1 minute before the trial, on the 7th floor hallway)

1961
01:10:37,381 --> 01:10:38,851
She's so scary.

1962
01:10:39,211 --> 01:10:40,251
Go first.

1963
01:10:40,881 --> 01:10:42,851
You can't rip it off here, right?

1964
01:10:42,851 --> 01:10:44,951
(You can't rip it off here, right?)

1965
01:10:44,951 --> 01:10:46,251
What? You're supposed to rip off name tags?

1966
01:10:46,581 --> 01:10:48,311
- Just in case. - How do you know that?

1967
01:10:48,381 --> 01:10:50,251
- I mean, earlier... - What do you mean?

1968
01:10:50,251 --> 01:10:51,611
You knew it was about ripping the name tag.

1969
01:10:51,611 --> 01:10:53,311
- Right now... - The civilians had no idea.

1970
01:10:53,311 --> 01:10:56,611
Don't only the thieves know about it?

1971
01:10:56,811 --> 01:10:59,211
(Isn't Running Man about ripping name tags?)

1972
01:10:59,211 --> 01:11:01,851
- If you think I'm a thief... - Everyone, let's save So Min...

1973
01:11:02,851 --> 01:11:04,711
from this suffering.

1974
01:11:06,111 --> 01:11:07,151
It's not me.

1975
01:11:07,151 --> 01:11:09,211
- I never thought it was her. - It's not me.

1976
01:11:09,211 --> 01:11:11,481
It's not really me.

1977
01:11:11,481 --> 01:11:13,311
- Who do you think the thief is? - Mention one name.

1978
01:11:13,311 --> 01:11:14,911
I think it's Jong Kook. He's my first pick.

1979
01:11:14,911 --> 01:11:17,711
- Why? Why is it me? - Earlier...

1980
01:11:17,711 --> 01:11:18,881
- You were acting strange. - Look into my eyes.

1981
01:11:18,881 --> 01:11:20,881
What did you find strange?

1982
01:11:20,881 --> 01:11:22,451
You were really angry today.

1983
01:11:22,451 --> 01:11:25,911
Aren't you way too close? Don't you think?

1984
01:11:25,911 --> 01:11:27,251
You were really angry,

1985
01:11:27,251 --> 01:11:30,211
and you are usually good in games.

1986
01:11:30,211 --> 01:11:31,521
- I was good today. - You were...

1987
01:11:31,521 --> 01:11:33,051
But you were being too angry.

1988
01:11:33,051 --> 01:11:36,021
- That's normal of me. - Especially today, right?

1989
01:11:36,021 --> 01:11:38,651
If he's not the thief, and if he's still this angry,

1990
01:11:38,651 --> 01:11:40,381
he should go see a counselor.

1991
01:11:40,381 --> 01:11:42,781
(He should go see a counselor.)

1992
01:11:42,851 --> 01:11:45,281
- I think strongly of this. - Hold on.

1993
01:11:45,281 --> 01:11:47,081
It's not time to look for a thief if you're not one.

1994
01:11:47,081 --> 01:11:48,381
I don't feel different.

1995
01:11:48,381 --> 01:11:49,711
I don't think you can control your emotions.

1996
01:11:49,711 --> 01:11:51,311
I'm not bothered by it.

1997
01:11:51,311 --> 01:11:53,981
I'm totally fine.

1998
01:11:54,521 --> 01:11:57,521
Let's commence the trial.

1999
01:11:57,521 --> 01:11:58,551
Starting from Haha,

2000
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:02,051
please state who you'd like to put on trial.

2001
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:03,381
(The person who gets picked will be eliminated with the majority vote.)

2002
01:12:03,381 --> 01:12:05,381
- I don't know. - Everybody.

2003
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:08,211
Please trust my instinct as the Mapo Sheriff.

2004
01:12:08,311 --> 01:12:10,521
Let's put So Min to ease.

2005
01:12:10,521 --> 01:12:12,481
- It's not me. - Kwang Soo is next.

2006
01:12:12,481 --> 01:12:15,211
- So Min. - It's not me.

2007
01:12:15,211 --> 01:12:16,311
Se Chan?

2008
01:12:16,611 --> 01:12:19,111
I pick...

2009
01:12:19,111 --> 01:12:20,181
(He takes his time.)

2010
01:12:20,181 --> 01:12:21,951
(He's careful.)

2011
01:12:22,711 --> 01:12:28,181
(He thought it was Jae Seok before going into the court.)

2012
01:12:28,181 --> 01:12:33,381
(He shot Jae Seok and waited to eliminate him.)

2013
01:12:33,381 --> 01:12:35,211
(There has been a twist in the story.)

2014
01:12:35,211 --> 01:12:37,711
(Jae Seok got shot by the thief?)

2015
01:12:37,711 --> 01:12:39,611
- I got shot too? - You got shot.

2016
01:12:40,081 --> 01:12:42,111
(If Jae Seok is not the thief,)

2017
01:12:42,111 --> 01:12:44,451
(the only potential suspect is...)

2018
01:12:44,451 --> 01:12:46,081
You'll get punished. It's not me.

2019
01:12:46,081 --> 01:12:47,711
(The only potential suspect is...)

2020
01:12:47,711 --> 01:12:48,911
So Min.

2021
01:12:48,911 --> 01:12:50,281
(He picks So Min after some thought.)

2022
01:12:50,551 --> 01:12:51,751
(Sheriff Yang picks So Min after some thought.)

2023
01:12:51,751 --> 01:12:53,581
- So Min. - This is done.

2024
01:12:53,581 --> 01:12:56,451
Then, a majority has been reached,

2025
01:12:56,451 --> 01:12:59,381
so we'll have So Min stand on the R mark.

2026
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:01,181
It's not me.

2027
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:03,951
I was always weird.

2028
01:13:03,951 --> 01:13:05,911
- I think it might be her. - I didn't do anything.

2029
01:13:05,911 --> 01:13:07,581
I didn't do anything.

2030
01:13:07,581 --> 01:13:09,381
You can change your mind now. It's not me.

2031
01:13:09,381 --> 01:13:11,021
So Min's identity is...

2032
01:13:11,021 --> 01:13:12,081
(So Min is the first defendant.)

2033
01:13:12,081 --> 01:13:15,311
In 1, 2, 3.

2034
01:13:15,311 --> 01:13:16,951
(Her identity is written inside her name tag.)

2035
01:13:16,951 --> 01:13:18,081
If you're a civilian, I'll treat you to dinner.

2036
01:13:18,981 --> 01:13:21,051
(She was always weird,)

2037
01:13:21,051 --> 01:13:24,251
(but she was weirder today.)

2038
01:13:24,381 --> 01:13:26,351
(Se Chan, I'm actually the sheriff.)

2039
01:13:26,351 --> 01:13:29,111
(She impersonated the sheriff in front of a real one.)

2040
01:13:29,111 --> 01:13:31,911
(Was it because she was the thief?)

2041
01:13:31,911 --> 01:13:34,881
(Or was she always weird?)

2042
01:13:34,881 --> 01:13:38,451
(So Min, please rest now.)

2043
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:42,781
(What is her identity?)

2044
01:13:48,711 --> 01:13:50,811
(It's unbelievable.)

2045
01:13:51,111 --> 01:13:53,051
(The first defendant, So Min, is...)

2046
01:13:53,051 --> 01:13:54,951
I told you it's not me.

2047
01:13:54,951 --> 01:13:57,311
(She is an innocent civilian.)

2048
01:13:57,451 --> 01:14:00,211
(She's the first victim.)

2049
01:14:00,211 --> 01:14:03,151
It's not her. I can't watch this.

2050
01:14:03,951 --> 01:14:06,651
(I need to break out of jail.)

2051
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:07,651
I'm so mad.

2052
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:10,581
Why did Haha say that?

2053
01:14:10,581 --> 01:14:11,951
- What happened? - I told you.

2054
01:14:11,951 --> 01:14:13,951
I didn't suspect So Min.

2055
01:14:13,951 --> 01:14:16,211
I told you it's not me.

2056
01:14:16,211 --> 01:14:19,211
Everybody, we should suspect Haha.

2057
01:14:19,211 --> 01:14:20,211
(Haha becomes the main suspect for accusing So Min.)

2058
01:14:20,211 --> 01:14:21,251
It's not me.

2059
01:14:21,251 --> 01:14:23,311
He's strange. He accused So Min.

2060
01:14:23,681 --> 01:14:25,611
An innocent civilian died,

2061
01:14:25,611 --> 01:14:28,551
so the race resumes now.

2062
01:14:28,551 --> 01:14:30,481
Please move back to your original positions.

2063
01:14:31,521 --> 01:14:33,311
(Haha, Kwang Soo, Jong Kook, and Jae Seok are the candidates.)

2064
01:14:33,311 --> 01:14:34,951
I think Kwang Soo is the sheriff.

2065
01:14:36,151 --> 01:14:37,981
I have to find something to make progress.

2066
01:14:38,551 --> 01:14:42,981
(They can't trust each other, so they must find the hints.)

2067
01:14:44,251 --> 01:14:46,381
Hey, are you the sheriff?

2068
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:48,211
- I'm not. - You're not?

2069
01:14:48,211 --> 01:14:49,611
- I'm not. - Are you the thief?

2070
01:14:49,851 --> 01:14:51,581
I'm not. Jae Seok,

2071
01:14:52,451 --> 01:14:54,651
I think you'll be eliminated soon.

2072
01:14:55,851 --> 01:14:57,651
If you have some hints, please share it with me.

2073
01:14:57,651 --> 01:14:58,911
I have none.

2074
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:00,451
You got shot twice.

2075
01:15:00,911 --> 01:15:02,211
You're a living dead.

2076
01:15:02,951 --> 01:15:05,911
Tell me everything and die in honor.

2077
01:15:05,911 --> 01:15:07,751
I don't know who shot me.

2078
01:15:07,981 --> 01:15:09,781
Try guessing who shot you.

2079
01:15:10,711 --> 01:15:11,851
I met you,

2080
01:15:12,311 --> 01:15:13,521
Se Chan...

2081
01:15:13,521 --> 01:15:14,811
(He met everybody.)

2082
01:15:14,811 --> 01:15:15,951
- I met Seok Jin... - Twice...

2083
01:15:16,111 --> 01:15:17,181
What's that?

2084
01:15:18,181 --> 01:15:19,211
Your sock...

2085
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:20,581
What's that?

2086
01:15:21,251 --> 01:15:22,981
(Your sock...)

2087
01:15:22,981 --> 01:15:24,111
What's that?

2088
01:15:24,111 --> 01:15:25,181
(Kwon Ryeol's sock?)

2089
01:15:25,181 --> 01:15:26,251
What's that?

2090
01:15:26,521 --> 01:15:30,811
(Why is there pink paint?)

2091
01:15:31,611 --> 01:15:32,651
(Hold on.)

2092
01:15:32,651 --> 01:15:34,451
Look at him. Hey.

2093
01:15:35,451 --> 01:15:37,851
(It's the paint they saw earlier.)

2094
01:15:37,851 --> 01:15:39,381
(It was on Seok Jin...)

2095
01:15:39,381 --> 01:15:42,451
(and Se Chan's backs.)

2096
01:15:42,551 --> 01:15:47,281
(Why is Kwon Ryeol's sock soaked with it?)

2097
01:15:47,681 --> 01:15:48,911
Did you shoot?

2098
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:51,811
(No way. Is it...)

2099
01:15:52,081 --> 01:15:54,651
(Is it him?)

2100
01:15:56,081 --> 01:15:58,751
(This morning, 30 minutes before the start of filming)

2101
01:16:01,021 --> 01:16:05,181
(Jae Seok and another thief are here.)

2102
01:16:05,881 --> 01:16:08,651
(Jae Seok is Thief A.)

2103
01:16:08,751 --> 01:16:12,111
Today's special is Defend the Stickers.

2104
01:16:12,111 --> 01:16:14,351
Thieves Among Us.

2105
01:16:14,351 --> 01:16:16,381
- Is that right? - The two of you...

2106
01:16:16,381 --> 01:16:18,951
are thieves who stole the I Go Stickers.

2107
01:16:19,551 --> 01:16:20,651
Us?

2108
01:16:20,651 --> 01:16:22,451
The rest of the members are civilians.

2109
01:16:22,451 --> 01:16:23,521
(These are innocent civilians who must reveal the thieves.)

2110
01:16:23,521 --> 01:16:25,381
And one of them...

2111
01:16:25,381 --> 01:16:27,381
is the sheriff, who is on the civilians' side.

2112
01:16:27,481 --> 01:16:30,211
You must find the sheriff...

2113
01:16:30,211 --> 01:16:32,111
and eliminate him or her to win.

2114
01:16:32,111 --> 01:16:35,111
On the other hand, if you get eliminated, the civilians win.

2115
01:16:35,111 --> 01:16:36,711
(They'll try to eliminate each other to win.)

2116
01:16:36,811 --> 01:16:38,081
(So that's how Jae Seok started.)

2117
01:16:38,081 --> 01:16:39,451
- Your fingers. - Do it in one shot.

2118
01:16:40,381 --> 01:16:42,181
(He interfered with the missions so that they can't get hints.)

2119
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:43,811
- Hold on. - So Min.

2120
01:16:43,811 --> 01:16:44,981
- Jae Seok. - He did that on purpose.

2121
01:16:46,551 --> 01:16:48,611
You're one of the thieves, Jae Seok.

2122
01:16:48,611 --> 01:16:49,681
Oh, gosh.

2123
01:16:49,681 --> 01:16:51,481
- Here's something special. - What is it?

2124
01:16:51,481 --> 01:16:53,751
The thieves and the sheriff...

2125
01:16:53,751 --> 01:16:55,851
can kill each other...

2126
01:16:55,851 --> 01:16:58,211
during the 30 minutes of the race.

2127
01:16:58,351 --> 01:17:00,951
You can kill the sheriff or the civilians by...

2128
01:17:00,951 --> 01:17:02,681
- What is it? - What are you known for?

2129
01:17:04,151 --> 01:17:06,311
The water gun. Do I shoot it?

2130
01:17:06,351 --> 01:17:07,521
(Jae Seok makes his return with the water gun as the thief.)

2131
01:17:07,521 --> 01:17:09,211
This water gun is important...

2132
01:17:09,481 --> 01:17:13,081
because once you shoot at a civilian's name tag,

2133
01:17:13,081 --> 01:17:18,021
he must rip the name tag to eliminate the civilian.

2134
01:17:18,021 --> 01:17:19,781
This is difficult.

2135
01:17:19,781 --> 01:17:21,751
(If he eliminates a civilian, a hint will be released about him.)

2136
01:17:22,981 --> 01:17:25,881
- Why are you drinking that? - It's open.

2137
01:17:26,811 --> 01:17:28,521
(Spraying)

2138
01:17:30,151 --> 01:17:32,651
(Jae Seok shot at everybody...)

2139
01:17:32,651 --> 01:17:35,681
(he suspected to be the sheriff.)

2140
01:17:35,811 --> 01:17:38,881
(He planned it out so that they will be eliminated quickly.)

2141
01:17:38,881 --> 01:17:40,451
- Okay. - I'm getting goosebumps.

2142
01:17:40,451 --> 01:17:42,551
(He also approached Se Chan.)

2143
01:17:42,551 --> 01:17:43,881
Why is he doing that?

2144
01:17:44,351 --> 01:17:47,381
(He shot at the sheriff without incurring any suspicion.)

2145
01:17:47,381 --> 01:17:49,181
Me? Why me?

2146
01:17:49,181 --> 01:17:53,851
(Why did he turn away on his way to the court?)

2147
01:17:54,481 --> 01:17:55,581
Can you shoot at me too?

2148
01:17:55,581 --> 01:17:57,311
(Kwon Ryeol, shoot at me too.)

2149
01:17:57,311 --> 01:18:01,581
(He shoots at his own back too.)

2150
01:18:01,851 --> 01:18:06,381
(He avoided everybody's suspicion.)

2151
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:08,111
- I got shot too? - You got shot.

2152
01:18:09,681 --> 01:18:14,181
(Everything was going perfect for him,)

2153
01:18:14,181 --> 01:18:15,481
(and Kwon Ryeol's sock might give him away.)

2154
01:18:15,481 --> 01:18:17,381
Kwang Soo, I don't know anything.

2155
01:18:17,751 --> 01:18:19,711
It's not me. Kwang Soo...

2156
01:18:19,711 --> 01:18:20,711
(That's what it is.)

2157
01:18:20,711 --> 01:18:23,581
Hey, how can you do this? My gosh.

2158
01:18:23,711 --> 01:18:24,911
Kwang Soo.

2159
01:18:24,911 --> 01:18:25,951
(Kwang Soo sprints away.)

2160
01:18:26,311 --> 01:18:27,381
Jong Kook!

2161
01:18:27,711 --> 01:18:28,851
My goodness.

2162
01:18:30,951 --> 01:18:32,811
It's not me. My gosh.

2163
01:18:34,551 --> 01:18:38,611
(Kwang Soo ran off without the cameraman.)

2164
01:18:38,711 --> 01:18:40,351
Your cameraman is back there.

2165
01:18:40,351 --> 01:18:42,181
- Where was he? - He was looking for you.

2166
01:18:42,181 --> 01:18:44,211
- Jong Kook. - What is it?

2167
01:18:44,521 --> 01:18:46,951
- This is so shocking. - Why?

2168
01:18:47,151 --> 01:18:48,381
- This is so shocking. - Why?

2169
01:18:48,381 --> 01:18:49,481
(His heart is still pounding.)

2170
01:18:49,481 --> 01:18:51,311
What's going on? What is it?

2171
01:18:52,211 --> 01:18:54,551
- Tell me what's going on. - I was talking to Jae Seok.

2172
01:18:54,551 --> 01:18:56,481
I don't know if I should tell you this.

2173
01:18:56,481 --> 01:18:57,581
Why not?

2174
01:18:57,581 --> 01:18:59,911
I thought it was Jae Seok for sure.

2175
01:18:59,911 --> 01:19:02,651
I was talking to him, and I was looking around.

2176
01:19:02,651 --> 01:19:03,681
Okay.

2177
01:19:03,681 --> 01:19:06,581
Kwon Ryeol was wearing a pink sock and a white sock.

2178
01:19:07,311 --> 01:19:08,911
- What? - I thought...

2179
01:19:09,551 --> 01:19:12,281
that was strange, and I looked.

2180
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:16,521
His sock was soaked with pink paint.

2181
01:19:17,881 --> 01:19:19,281
- Really? - Yes, it was Kwon Ryeol.

2182
01:19:19,281 --> 01:19:21,811
I'm right. It's Jae Seok. I'm certain.

2183
01:19:21,811 --> 01:19:23,381
I don't think it's something to be surprised about.

2184
01:19:23,381 --> 01:19:25,021
(Is that all?)

2185
01:19:25,181 --> 01:19:27,381
I gave you an important information.

2186
01:19:27,381 --> 01:19:29,311
It's not something to consider lightly.

2187
01:19:29,311 --> 01:19:32,281
We kind of suspected him from the beginning.

2188
01:19:33,581 --> 01:19:34,651
Kwang Soo.

2189
01:19:34,651 --> 01:19:35,751
(Jae Seok joins them.)

2190
01:19:36,911 --> 01:19:39,021
Hey, you... Listen to me.

2191
01:19:39,021 --> 01:19:40,611
(He runs away as soon as he sees the thief.)

2192
01:19:43,481 --> 01:19:44,981
- Don't come near. Talk there. - What did he say?

2193
01:19:45,581 --> 01:19:48,151
- Hey, Kwang Soo. - Hey...

2194
01:19:48,311 --> 01:19:50,911
What are we supposed to do?

2195
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:52,481
No... Hold on.

2196
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:55,481
- Hold on. Don't tell Jong Kook. - Are you the sheriff?

2197
01:19:57,381 --> 01:19:59,651
You're not the sheriff.

2198
01:20:00,581 --> 01:20:02,781
(If you're the sheriff,)

2199
01:20:02,781 --> 01:20:04,751
(you shouldn't run away from the thief.)

2200
01:20:04,751 --> 01:20:05,851
You're not the sheriff.

2201
01:20:09,521 --> 01:20:11,021
(He starts a mission of his own.)

2202
01:20:11,021 --> 01:20:13,811
You're not the sheriff, so you can't go around talking about me.

2203
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:16,851
I'll be in trouble.

2204
01:20:17,181 --> 01:20:18,381
Be careful, Kwang Soo.

2205
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:21,021
I'm the sheriff.

2206
01:20:21,551 --> 01:20:24,681
Are you planning to spoil everything?

2207
01:20:24,681 --> 01:20:26,021
(Keep my identity a secret.)

2208
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:27,751
You told Jong Kook I was acting strange, right?

2209
01:20:28,551 --> 01:20:29,751
Be careful, Kwang Soo.

2210
01:20:29,751 --> 01:20:31,451
(I didn't know you were the sheriff.)

2211
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:34,021
You can't go around saying that.

2212
01:20:34,681 --> 01:20:36,211
Be quiet.

2213
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:38,151
(It's fun lying to Kwang Soo.)

2214
01:20:39,281 --> 01:20:42,451
(Kwang Soo knows about the water gun so Jae Seok gets ready to shoot.)

2215
01:20:42,681 --> 01:20:43,751
(Spraying)

2216
01:20:44,981 --> 01:20:47,111
(Kwang Soo's name tag is ready to be ripped off.)

2217
01:20:47,981 --> 01:20:49,081
You need to think.

2218
01:20:49,081 --> 01:20:50,381
(If you are a civilian, you should protect the sheriff.)

2219
01:20:50,381 --> 01:20:52,811
What are you going to do if I am the sheriff?

2220
01:20:52,811 --> 01:20:55,051
Kwon Ryeol, change socks with me.

2221
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:58,021
For goodness' sake.

2222
01:20:58,111 --> 01:20:59,711
You need to think.

2223
01:20:59,811 --> 01:21:01,211
You are the sheriff.

2224
01:21:01,211 --> 01:21:02,581
Of course, I am.

2225
01:21:03,581 --> 01:21:05,381
- For goodness' sake. - You are the sheriff.

2226
01:21:06,211 --> 01:21:07,381
Don't tell anyone.

2227
01:21:07,381 --> 01:21:08,811
(Keep my identity a secret.)

2228
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:10,521
You aren't the sheriff.

2229
01:21:10,911 --> 01:21:11,911
Then keep quiet.

2230
01:21:11,911 --> 01:21:12,911
(He checks until the end.)

2231
01:21:14,021 --> 01:21:15,981
(Jae Seok acquires a dependable ally.)

2232
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:19,181
(The real sheriff is looking for the thieves.)

2233
01:21:19,181 --> 01:21:20,581
- Did you find the thieves? - Kwang Soo.

2234
01:21:20,911 --> 01:21:22,521
- Did you find the thieves? - No, I didn't.

2235
01:21:22,521 --> 01:21:23,651
(Who are the thieves?)

2236
01:21:23,651 --> 01:21:25,551
- Where is Haha? - I don't know. Tell me.

2237
01:21:25,551 --> 01:21:27,351
- I have no idea. - Jae Seok,

2238
01:21:27,711 --> 01:21:28,711
it's showing.

2239
01:21:28,711 --> 01:21:30,681
(His water gun is showing.)

2240
01:21:32,181 --> 01:21:34,381
(The person who has a water gun...)

2241
01:21:34,381 --> 01:21:37,851
(other than the sheriff is...)

2242
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:39,381
(the thief.)

2243
01:21:39,381 --> 01:21:40,451
Wait a minute.

2244
01:21:41,581 --> 01:21:43,551
Catch him.

2245
01:21:43,711 --> 01:21:44,711
I am not a thief.

2246
01:21:44,711 --> 01:21:45,811
Wait a minute.

2247
01:21:46,521 --> 01:21:47,581
(Jae Seok's name tag has been sprayed.)

2248
01:21:47,981 --> 01:21:51,521
(Removing the name tag will eliminate him.)

2249
01:21:51,521 --> 01:21:52,521
(Slipping)

2250
01:21:52,911 --> 01:21:54,381
You are mistaken.

2251
01:21:54,381 --> 01:21:55,851
He could be the sheriff.

2252
01:21:55,851 --> 01:21:57,311
- No, he isn't. Catch him. - He could be the sheriff.

2253
01:21:57,311 --> 01:21:58,711
He could be the sheriff.

2254
01:21:58,711 --> 01:22:00,281
- Catch him. - Come to your senses.

2255
01:22:00,281 --> 01:22:02,851
(Jae Seok is the sheriff.)

2256
01:22:03,281 --> 01:22:04,311
- No, he isn't. - Come to your senses.

2257
01:22:04,311 --> 01:22:05,651
- Come to your senses. - Think.

2258
01:22:05,651 --> 01:22:06,911
- Come to your senses. - Think.

2259
01:22:06,911 --> 01:22:07,911
What's going on?

2260
01:22:07,911 --> 01:22:08,911
(The members gather.)

2261
01:22:08,911 --> 01:22:10,211
Who is the sheriff?

2262
01:22:10,211 --> 01:22:11,751
What's going on?

2263
01:22:12,021 --> 01:22:14,351
- He is the sheriff. - Kwang Soo, come here.

2264
01:22:14,351 --> 01:22:15,811
- Jae Seok, come here. - Who is the sheriff?

2265
01:22:15,811 --> 01:22:17,481
- Who is the sheriff? - Come here.

2266
01:22:17,481 --> 01:22:19,311
- Who is the sheriff? - What's going on?

2267
01:22:19,311 --> 01:22:20,751
I will finish everyone off.

2268
01:22:21,381 --> 01:22:24,451
There is no need to think. He is the thief.

2269
01:22:24,811 --> 01:22:26,211
I need to be alone.

2270
01:22:26,211 --> 01:22:27,381
Let me go over my thoughts.

2271
01:22:27,381 --> 01:22:28,481
(Get out. I need to be alone.)

2272
01:22:29,021 --> 01:22:30,211
Come here.

2273
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:32,081
(Thanks to Kwang Soo, Jae Seok escapes.)

2274
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:37,081
(It's all thanks to Kwang Soo that I lost Jae Seok.)

2275
01:22:38,481 --> 01:22:41,021
(Jae Seok has Kwang Soo fooled.)

2276
01:22:41,021 --> 01:22:42,021
Haha.

2277
01:22:44,611 --> 01:22:47,311
(Finding hints is the way to go.)

2278
01:22:47,711 --> 01:22:48,711
Have you been sprayed?

2279
01:22:49,611 --> 01:22:50,711
You haven't been sprayed yet, right?

2280
01:22:50,811 --> 01:22:51,811
I have been sprayed.

2281
01:22:51,981 --> 01:22:53,311
- You have? - Yes.

2282
01:22:53,811 --> 01:22:58,311
(Have you been sprayed?)

2283
01:22:59,851 --> 01:23:02,181
I must find hints, and deduce the answer...

2284
01:23:02,181 --> 01:23:03,681
without talking to anyone.

2285
01:23:04,711 --> 01:23:06,681
I don't know whom to trust.

2286
01:23:10,181 --> 01:23:11,711
You just need to remove the name tag.

2287
01:23:12,351 --> 01:23:13,451
Just eliminate him.

2288
01:23:16,811 --> 01:23:18,281
(Why do I feel...)

2289
01:23:18,281 --> 01:23:22,081
(a sense of foreboding?)

2290
01:23:23,651 --> 01:23:27,481
Civilian Lee Kwang Soo is out.

2291
01:23:27,851 --> 01:23:30,211
Civilian Lee Kwang Soo is out.

2292
01:23:31,611 --> 01:23:34,521
(Since a civilian is out, it's time to get a hint on the thieves.)

2293
01:23:34,521 --> 01:23:36,811
Kwang Soo was a civilian. This is bad.

2294
01:23:36,811 --> 01:23:39,451
Thief B didn't go into Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.

2295
01:23:39,451 --> 01:23:43,181
(Thief B didn't go into Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

2296
01:23:43,951 --> 01:23:48,211
(Haha and Jong Kook are the only ones.)

2297
01:23:48,211 --> 01:23:51,981
(Is one of them Thief B?)

2298
01:23:53,211 --> 01:23:57,281
(Since Jae Seok had already sprayed Kwang Soo's name tag,)

2299
01:23:57,281 --> 01:24:01,851
(the other thief only had to remove it.)

2300
01:24:01,851 --> 01:24:05,211
(Who is the other thief?)

2301
01:24:07,711 --> 01:24:08,711
Jong Kook.

2302
01:24:10,551 --> 01:24:13,181
(Kim Jong Kook)

2303
01:24:13,811 --> 01:24:15,811
You are the thief. Jong Kook.

2304
01:24:15,811 --> 01:24:17,551
(Ripping)

2305
01:24:18,711 --> 01:24:20,911
- Jong Kook. - Stay down.

2306
01:24:20,911 --> 01:24:22,021
(Kwang Soo is out.)

2307
01:24:24,281 --> 01:24:25,281
All right.

2308
01:24:25,281 --> 01:24:26,281
(Kwang Soo, are you surprised?)

2309
01:24:28,111 --> 01:24:29,981
(This morning, 30 minutes before the shoot)

2310
01:24:31,021 --> 01:24:32,451
(Two thieves gathered to receive a secret order.)

2311
01:24:36,081 --> 01:24:38,581
(Thief B, Kim Jong Kook)

2312
01:24:39,521 --> 01:24:40,951
(Jae Seok and Jong Kook hadn't worked together recently.)

2313
01:24:40,951 --> 01:24:42,081
For goodness' sake.

2314
01:24:42,281 --> 01:24:43,951
We are in...

2315
01:24:44,021 --> 01:24:45,911
the opposing teams.

2316
01:24:45,911 --> 01:24:46,951
Listen.

2317
01:24:46,981 --> 01:24:49,951
We aren't meant to sit together like this.

2318
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:51,551
This is frustrating.

2319
01:24:51,551 --> 01:24:53,021
- How frustrating. - Give us the mission. What is it?

2320
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:54,181
Let us finish it, and leave.

2321
01:24:54,181 --> 01:24:56,581
It's stifling to be in the same room as Jong Kook.

2322
01:24:56,581 --> 01:24:58,711
I can't breathe.

2323
01:24:58,711 --> 01:25:02,111
Today, we will have Defend the Stickers,

2324
01:25:02,111 --> 01:25:03,811
Thieves Among Us.

2325
01:25:03,811 --> 01:25:05,021
Really?

2326
01:25:05,021 --> 01:25:06,551
Will he be the thief?

2327
01:25:06,551 --> 01:25:07,651
- For goodness' sake. - Will I catch him?

2328
01:25:07,651 --> 01:25:09,311
Both of us will be thieves.

2329
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:13,211
But you know, since Jae Seok is sloppy,

2330
01:25:13,211 --> 01:25:14,781
I am a bit worried.

2331
01:25:14,811 --> 01:25:15,911
How frustrating.

2332
01:25:15,911 --> 01:25:18,281
He should be the thief, and I, the sheriff.

2333
01:25:18,611 --> 01:25:20,451
That's the relationship we have.

2334
01:25:20,451 --> 01:25:22,751
If one of us gets caught,

2335
01:25:22,751 --> 01:25:23,751
- can the other play the game? - Will it end the game?

2336
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:26,481
Thieves will win if only one survives and catches the sheriff.

2337
01:25:26,481 --> 01:25:27,981
- Really? - I see.

2338
01:25:28,021 --> 01:25:29,281
- In that case, - That's nice.

2339
01:25:29,281 --> 01:25:30,911
I can use him as bait.

2340
01:25:31,111 --> 01:25:32,711
What are you talking about?

2341
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:34,521
That will be nice.

2342
01:25:34,521 --> 01:25:37,311
If you do that, I will destroy everything.

2343
01:25:37,311 --> 01:25:38,521
(Try me.)

2344
01:25:38,911 --> 01:25:40,281
- You know what I am like, right? - Don't be that way.

2345
01:25:40,281 --> 01:25:41,851
- I won't die alone. - For goodness' sake.

2346
01:25:41,851 --> 01:25:43,521
You know what Kwang Soo and I are like, right?

2347
01:25:43,711 --> 01:25:45,211
- We are moths. - I know.

2348
01:25:45,211 --> 01:25:47,111
- We fly into the flame. - I know.

2349
01:25:47,311 --> 01:25:49,211
All right.

2350
01:25:49,211 --> 01:25:50,981
For goodness' sake.

2351
01:25:50,981 --> 01:25:51,981
My goodness.

2352
01:25:53,651 --> 01:25:56,811
(As soon as the other members suspected Jae Seok,)

2353
01:25:56,811 --> 01:26:00,811
(Jong Kook cast him as bait.)

2354
01:26:00,811 --> 01:26:05,811
(He lead the suspicion on Jae Seok,)

2355
01:26:05,811 --> 01:26:09,281
(and avoided getting suspected himself.)

2356
01:26:10,551 --> 01:26:11,851
The doors are closing.

2357
01:26:13,451 --> 01:26:15,081
For goodness' sake.

2358
01:26:15,081 --> 01:26:17,381
- You need to work properly. - You need to work properly.

2359
01:26:18,081 --> 01:26:19,181
You need to work properly.

2360
01:26:19,181 --> 01:26:20,651
What in the world are you doing?

2361
01:26:20,651 --> 01:26:22,911
- I have never seen anyone... - Do you want me to self-destruct?

2362
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:24,851
- who is worse at this. - Do you want me to self-destruct?

2363
01:26:25,081 --> 01:26:26,111
Do you want to ruin everything?

2364
01:26:26,111 --> 01:26:28,211
- What choice did I have? - How dare you throw me to them?

2365
01:26:28,211 --> 01:26:30,451
Had I defended you,

2366
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:33,911
we would have fallen under everyone's suspicion.

2367
01:26:33,911 --> 01:26:35,811
- Let's catch the sheriff. - All right.

2368
01:26:35,811 --> 01:26:36,851
Work properly.

2369
01:26:36,851 --> 01:26:38,481
Hold on. I have a plan.

2370
01:26:38,711 --> 01:26:40,881
- Did you find the hints? - They are hard to find.

2371
01:26:41,751 --> 01:26:43,581
- You didn't find anything? - No, I didn't.

2372
01:26:43,581 --> 01:26:45,081
Jae Seok, aren't you busy?

2373
01:26:45,211 --> 01:26:47,451
- What? - Do you have time to play around?

2374
01:26:47,451 --> 01:26:48,851
(Let's go, Jae Seok.)

2375
01:26:48,851 --> 01:26:50,211
We should finish her off.

2376
01:26:51,811 --> 01:26:53,451
It's a water gun!

2377
01:26:53,451 --> 01:26:56,381
Ji Hyo, be quiet. Be quiet.

2378
01:26:56,381 --> 01:26:58,081
- Remove the name tag. - Come here.

2379
01:26:58,081 --> 01:26:59,911
Hurry up, and remove it.

2380
01:26:59,911 --> 01:27:02,481
(Jae Seok sprayed the name tag, and Jong Kook removed it.)

2381
01:27:02,651 --> 01:27:04,181
(That's how Ji Hyo got eliminated first.)

2382
01:27:04,611 --> 01:27:06,851
Since there is glass everywhere, we should talk at a distance.

2383
01:27:06,851 --> 01:27:09,451
Listen to what I have to say from over there.

2384
01:27:09,551 --> 01:27:11,311
I will spray Kwang Soo's name tag.

2385
01:27:11,311 --> 01:27:13,981
- Spray Kwang Soo's name tag. - Even if I die,

2386
01:27:14,111 --> 01:27:17,011
- you need to finish the rest. - I will take care of them.

2387
01:27:17,011 --> 01:27:18,351
- Okay? - Okay.

2388
01:27:18,351 --> 01:27:19,681
Be careful.

2389
01:27:19,981 --> 01:27:22,081
I bet the sheriff has something he can use on us.

2390
01:27:22,081 --> 01:27:23,081
Okay.

2391
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:29,811
(Jae Seok followed the plan, and sprayed Kwang Soo's name tag.)

2392
01:27:29,811 --> 01:27:33,551
(Afterwards, Jong Kook finished him off.)

2393
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:36,751
Kwang Soo.

2394
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:38,711
(Kwang Soo, are you okay?)

2395
01:27:40,081 --> 01:27:41,711
(Kwang Soo still believes Jae Seok is the sheriff.)

2396
01:27:41,711 --> 01:27:42,751
You have been eliminated.

2397
01:27:42,751 --> 01:27:44,511
(Kwang Soo still believes Jae Seok is the sheriff.)

2398
01:27:45,651 --> 01:27:46,651
Kwang Soo.

2399
01:27:46,651 --> 01:27:47,881
What happened?

2400
01:27:49,011 --> 01:27:50,281
This is driving me crazy.

2401
01:27:50,711 --> 01:27:52,211
Who is the sheriff?

2402
01:27:53,851 --> 01:27:56,381
(Come here, you thief.)

2403
01:27:58,181 --> 01:28:01,281
(Kwang Soo, thank you for saving me earlier.)

2404
01:28:02,811 --> 01:28:05,811
(Kwon Ryeol, give me back my socks.)

2405
01:28:07,911 --> 01:28:10,011
Civilian Lee Kwang Soo is out.

2406
01:28:10,011 --> 01:28:12,311
Civilian Lee Kwang Soo is out.

2407
01:28:12,311 --> 01:28:14,381
The thieves eliminated an innocent civilian.

2408
01:28:14,381 --> 01:28:17,081
Thief B didn't go into Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.

2409
01:28:17,111 --> 01:28:18,481
It's Jong Kook.

2410
01:28:18,481 --> 01:28:19,611
(People become certain that Jong Kook is the thief.)

2411
01:28:20,351 --> 01:28:21,381
(If they have a trial, Jong Kook will be eliminated.)

2412
01:28:22,311 --> 01:28:23,511
It's Jong Kook.

2413
01:28:23,511 --> 01:28:25,111
(If they have a trial, Jong Kook will be eliminated.)

2414
01:28:25,111 --> 01:28:26,111
It's certain.

2415
01:28:26,851 --> 01:28:30,381
You have three minutes until the trial.

2416
01:28:30,381 --> 01:28:31,911
(The thieves have no time.)

2417
01:28:31,911 --> 01:28:32,911
Let's talk.

2418
01:28:34,211 --> 01:28:36,651
Jae Seok, shall we out everyone?

2419
01:28:36,651 --> 01:28:37,681
Hold on.

2420
01:28:38,351 --> 01:28:40,551
Either Seok Jin or Se Chan is the sheriff.

2421
01:28:40,581 --> 01:28:42,511
- Really? - The hint I found said...

2422
01:28:42,511 --> 01:28:43,711
the sheriff's name contains the letter S.

2423
01:28:44,381 --> 01:28:46,451
(A moment ago)

2424
01:28:47,851 --> 01:28:51,711
(Jae Seok found a hint by pure luck.)

2425
01:28:51,711 --> 01:28:53,151
Please let it be a hint on the sheriff.

2426
01:28:55,651 --> 01:28:58,181
(The sheriff's name contains the letter S.)

2427
01:28:58,581 --> 01:28:59,951
- Let's find and eliminate them. - That's right.

2428
01:28:59,951 --> 01:29:01,511
Don't worry about Haha.

2429
01:29:01,511 --> 01:29:03,381
- Let's find Seok Jin or Se Chan. - Are you sure it's one of them?

2430
01:29:03,381 --> 01:29:04,951
Remove their name tags as soon as you see them.

2431
01:29:05,181 --> 01:29:06,181
(Se Chan is their number 1 target.)

2432
01:29:06,181 --> 01:29:07,751
He isn't here.

2433
01:29:08,551 --> 01:29:10,011
It must be Se Chan.

2434
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:11,811
(They must catch Se Chan before the trial.)

2435
01:29:11,811 --> 01:29:12,811
Should I go here?

2436
01:29:14,011 --> 01:29:15,011
Where could he be?

2437
01:29:15,011 --> 01:29:16,011
(Se Chan's target is Jae Seok.)

2438
01:29:16,011 --> 01:29:17,251
Where could Jae Seok be?

2439
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:19,611
Hurry up and find him.

2440
01:29:19,611 --> 01:29:22,381
(The sheriff and the two thieves chase each other.)

2441
01:29:24,551 --> 01:29:27,011
- You have a minute until the trial. - We must catch him.

2442
01:29:27,811 --> 01:29:28,851
Otherwise, we will die.

2443
01:29:29,211 --> 01:29:32,081
(At that moment,)

2444
01:29:32,081 --> 01:29:36,111
(Jong Kook finds Se Chan.)

2445
01:29:38,381 --> 01:29:39,451
All right.

2446
01:29:39,911 --> 01:29:41,211
Come here.

2447
01:29:41,481 --> 01:29:42,481
Don't do that.

2448
01:29:42,481 --> 01:29:44,111
(He only needs to hold out for 20 seconds to catch them.)

2449
01:29:44,111 --> 01:29:45,781
- Se Chan. - Don't do that.

2450
01:29:45,811 --> 01:29:47,181
Se Chan.

2451
01:29:47,351 --> 01:29:48,851
Se Chan.

2452
01:29:48,851 --> 01:29:50,111
It's okay.

2453
01:29:50,111 --> 01:29:51,211
- Se Chan. - Wait a minute.

2454
01:29:51,211 --> 01:29:53,611
Jae Seok.

2455
01:29:53,611 --> 01:29:55,111
(The sheriff is out 15 seconds before the trial.)

2456
01:29:55,111 --> 01:29:56,681
- Are you the sheriff? - Are you the sheriff?

2457
01:29:57,711 --> 01:29:58,711
He is the sheriff.

2458
01:29:59,011 --> 01:30:00,251
Really?

2459
01:30:00,511 --> 01:30:01,511
(Sheriff)

2460
01:30:02,381 --> 01:30:05,051
My goodness.

2461
01:30:05,081 --> 01:30:08,611
- My goodness. - My goodness.

2462
01:30:08,711 --> 01:30:10,381
My goodness.

2463
01:30:13,381 --> 01:30:16,211
The winners are the thieves.

2464
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:18,511
Here comes the board.

2465
01:30:18,511 --> 01:30:21,751
The 2 thieves will take 2 I Go Stickers.

2466
01:30:21,751 --> 01:30:23,811
(The stolen I Go Stickers become theirs.)

2467
01:30:23,811 --> 01:30:25,811
This is the most important part.

2468
01:30:25,851 --> 01:30:28,111
Jong Kook and Jae Seok, discuss among yourselves,

2469
01:30:28,111 --> 01:30:30,611
and put the I Go Stickers on the board.

2470
01:30:30,611 --> 01:30:32,351
Will they put the Stickers without rolling a die?

2471
01:30:32,351 --> 01:30:33,381
That's right.

2472
01:30:33,751 --> 01:30:35,651
(Jae Seok and Jong Kook's Stickers...)

2473
01:30:35,651 --> 01:30:39,381
(will decide who goes on the trip.)

2474
01:30:39,381 --> 01:30:40,381
Congratulations.

2475
01:30:40,381 --> 01:30:42,651
(Congratulations.)

2476
01:30:42,651 --> 01:30:44,711
Thieves. Thieves.

2477
01:30:44,751 --> 01:30:46,881
Your eloquent words had me fooled.

2478
01:30:47,551 --> 01:30:49,481
We can't do anything when someone tries to con us.

2479
01:30:49,481 --> 01:30:50,851
- I... - You weren't feeling well, right?

2480
01:30:50,851 --> 01:30:52,851
There was no way we could have beaten you.

2481
01:30:52,851 --> 01:30:54,081
- Go, Jong Kook! - Today...

2482
01:30:54,311 --> 01:30:56,981
If we give one to this guy...

2483
01:30:57,051 --> 01:30:58,451
- Isn't that so sudden? - That's great.

2484
01:30:58,451 --> 01:30:59,781
- Hear me out. - This is fun.

2485
01:30:59,781 --> 01:31:01,981
We don't have to give one to this guy...

2486
01:31:01,981 --> 01:31:03,981
because he will be chosen by the member with three Stickers anyway.

2487
01:31:03,981 --> 01:31:05,211
(He will accompany the member.)

2488
01:31:06,081 --> 01:31:07,251
(He's bound to go.)

2489
01:31:07,251 --> 01:31:08,711
You didn't have to say that.

2490
01:31:08,711 --> 01:31:09,911
Why do you jump to conclusions?

2491
01:31:09,911 --> 01:31:14,151
Whoever gets three Stickers will choose him.

2492
01:31:14,151 --> 01:31:16,051
(It will be Kwang Soo.)

2493
01:31:16,051 --> 01:31:17,111
We can conclude he will go.

2494
01:31:17,111 --> 01:31:19,311
Why would we waste one Sticker on him?

2495
01:31:19,311 --> 01:31:20,881
I have no I Go Stickers.

2496
01:31:20,881 --> 01:31:21,981
(Will he continue to go on the trip?)

2497
01:31:22,711 --> 01:31:24,151
Is there something you want to say, So Min?

2498
01:31:24,781 --> 01:31:26,911
- I will do my best. - Wait.

2499
01:31:26,911 --> 01:31:28,211
- Should we give you one? - No.

2500
01:31:28,211 --> 01:31:29,211
(Will you do your best there?)

2501
01:31:29,511 --> 01:31:32,211
We will stand in the back and you can put the Stickers.

2502
01:31:32,211 --> 01:31:33,351
- Let's do that. - Okay.

2503
01:31:34,011 --> 01:31:35,811
- Let's have a close match. - Turn around and face the back.

2504
01:31:35,881 --> 01:31:37,281
This is intense.

2505
01:31:37,351 --> 01:31:38,951
- I think we can choose this member. - Okay.

2506
01:31:39,011 --> 01:31:40,551
- Please. - Should we put it here?

2507
01:31:40,551 --> 01:31:41,781
- I agree with you. - Okay.

2508
01:31:41,781 --> 01:31:44,281
- This member will go next week. - Consider it done.

2509
01:31:44,281 --> 01:31:48,381
(This is a place for 1 percent which is full of extreme experiences.)

2510
01:31:49,351 --> 01:31:53,211
(Haha is about to go on the trip and Seok Jin and So Min are close too.)

2511
01:31:54,711 --> 01:31:58,951
Everyone, on my count of three, turn around and see the result.

2512
01:31:59,581 --> 01:32:02,851
In 1, 2, 3.

2513
01:32:04,911 --> 01:32:06,581
What? Goodness.

2514
01:32:06,981 --> 01:32:08,011
Three.

2515
01:32:08,011 --> 01:32:10,051
(I didn't get the Sticker.)

2516
01:32:10,051 --> 01:32:11,311
- Is someone going? - Oh, no.

2517
01:32:11,311 --> 01:32:13,011
(Seok Jin and So Min get 1 Sticker each.)

2518
01:32:13,711 --> 01:32:15,281
(Seok Jin, So Min, and Haha all have 2 Stickers.)

2519
01:32:15,281 --> 01:32:18,051
- This is a three-way race. - It is.

2520
01:32:18,111 --> 01:32:19,511
- Kwang Soo. - Why?

2521
01:32:19,511 --> 01:32:21,651
- You survived. - Of course.

2522
01:32:21,651 --> 01:32:24,711
The number of Stickers for him doesn't matter.

2523
01:32:24,711 --> 01:32:26,311
(What are you talking about?)

2524
01:32:26,911 --> 01:32:28,351
In my opinion, Kwang Soo...

2525
01:32:28,881 --> 01:32:30,511
should start packing this week.

2526
01:32:30,511 --> 01:32:32,051
Why would I pack now?

2527
01:32:32,511 --> 01:32:35,051
- You can start now. - It won't be me.

2528
01:32:36,211 --> 01:32:39,811
- Next week, someone will be picked. - I agree.

2529
01:32:39,811 --> 01:32:41,311
- I'm certain of it. - That's right.

2530
01:32:41,551 --> 01:32:42,681
- Jong Kook. - Yes?

2531
01:32:42,681 --> 01:32:43,981
Are you okay going on the trip?

2532
01:32:43,981 --> 01:32:45,011
- Me? - Yes.

2533
01:32:45,011 --> 01:32:46,111
Who put this on here?

2534
01:32:46,111 --> 01:32:47,651
I am going to go with that person.

2535
01:32:47,651 --> 01:32:49,211
I don't know who it is. I will watch the episode.

2536
01:32:49,211 --> 01:32:50,811
- I'll pick that person. - Look.

2537
01:32:50,811 --> 01:32:53,981
- It will be a new world next week. - That's right.

2538
01:32:53,981 --> 01:32:56,951
(Next week, there will be a whole new world.)

2539
01:32:57,951 --> 01:33:01,611
(A Place for 1 Percent, the Final Race)

2540
01:33:02,551 --> 01:33:04,611
(The ones who want to be exempted from the trip...)

2541
01:33:04,611 --> 01:33:06,851
(must avoid being the unlucky one.)

2542
01:33:07,511 --> 01:33:09,811
(This is only a taste of the real trip.)

2543
01:33:10,351 --> 01:33:12,681
(There are no enemies...)

2544
01:33:12,681 --> 01:33:14,251
(or comrades.)

2545
01:33:14,251 --> 01:33:17,781
(This is a series of mistrust and betrayals.)

2546
01:33:18,611 --> 01:33:20,281
(No one can...)

2547
01:33:20,311 --> 01:33:22,911
(make any prediction.)

2548
01:33:22,911 --> 01:33:26,851
(This is the ultimate race of the twists.)

2549
01:33:27,811 --> 01:33:30,611
(If you can't avoid it, enjoy it.)

2550
01:33:30,611 --> 01:33:32,581
(Final Race for 1 Percent)

2551
01:33:34,111 --> 01:33:38,875
(Running Man)
