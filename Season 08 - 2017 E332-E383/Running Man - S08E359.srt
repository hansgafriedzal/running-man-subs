1
00:00:04,977 --> 00:00:08,077
(The 2017 Running Man's Second Global Project)

2
00:00:08,807 --> 00:00:10,777
(People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent)

3
00:00:11,607 --> 00:00:13,877
(The global viewers recommend A Place for 1 Percent.)

4
00:00:13,877 --> 00:00:17,147
(You can have a unique experience of seeing rare animals.)

5
00:00:17,407 --> 00:00:20,877
(The global viewers recommend destinations only they know about.)

6
00:00:20,877 --> 00:00:25,447
(A member with 3 I Go Stickers will go to A Place for 1 Percent.)

7
00:00:25,977 --> 00:00:28,047
(Thus started Global Project Part 2.)

8
00:00:28,907 --> 00:00:31,007
(Haha and So Min received a Sticker during the first race.)

9
00:00:32,177 --> 00:00:34,577
(Seok Jin received a Sticker during the second race.)

10
00:00:35,347 --> 00:00:36,347
Six!

11
00:00:36,607 --> 00:00:39,677
(Haha received a Sticker again during the third race.)

12
00:00:40,047 --> 00:00:43,507
(Last week, the thieves caught the sheriff and won.)

13
00:00:43,507 --> 00:00:45,507
(The thieves gave 1 Sticker each to Seok Jin and So Min.)

14
00:00:46,077 --> 00:00:47,077
It's a three-cornered fight.

15
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:51,247
(Among Haha, So Min, and Seok Jin, who will win a trip?)

16
00:00:51,577 --> 00:00:53,147
(A hot summer day at Sangam SBS Prism Tower)

17
00:00:53,147 --> 00:00:54,247
- Hello. - Hello.

18
00:00:54,247 --> 00:00:55,477
- Hello. - Hello.

19
00:00:55,477 --> 00:00:56,677
- Hello. - Hello.

20
00:00:56,677 --> 00:00:58,507
- Hello. - Hello.

21
00:00:58,507 --> 00:00:59,547
- Hello. - Hello.

22
00:00:59,547 --> 00:01:01,177
Hello.

23
00:01:01,177 --> 00:01:02,177
Hello.

24
00:01:02,477 --> 00:01:04,347
(Limping)

25
00:01:04,977 --> 00:01:08,877
(Wait a minute.)

26
00:01:08,877 --> 00:01:11,977
(Why is he wearing slippers?)

27
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:13,877
Jong Kook got a gout attack.

28
00:01:13,877 --> 00:01:15,477
Jong Kook is suffering...

29
00:01:15,647 --> 00:01:17,147
from a gout attack.

30
00:01:17,547 --> 00:01:18,647
I knew it would happen.

31
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:20,277
I asked the doctor,

32
00:01:20,277 --> 00:01:21,277
"Why does it happen to me?"

33
00:01:21,277 --> 00:01:22,647
It's because you consume too much protein.

34
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:24,177
- I know that, but... - It's the chicken breast.

35
00:01:24,177 --> 00:01:25,977
You need to eat less chicken breast.

36
00:01:25,977 --> 00:01:28,047
Wait a minute, does that mean we have an opportunity today?

37
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:29,177
- What kind of an opportunity? - Today is the day.

38
00:01:29,877 --> 00:01:30,877
Today is the day we strike back.

39
00:01:30,877 --> 00:01:32,647
You got an opportunity in eight years.

40
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:34,147
You got an opportunity in eight years.

41
00:01:34,777 --> 00:01:37,577
While he wore slippers because of his swollen feet,

42
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:39,107
Jong Kook's upper body is very much alive.

43
00:01:39,677 --> 00:01:40,677
He is still strong.

44
00:01:40,677 --> 00:01:42,247
His upper body is fine.

45
00:01:42,247 --> 00:01:43,977
Jong Kook is still strong.

46
00:01:43,977 --> 00:01:46,707
He will follow you in a handstand.

47
00:01:47,377 --> 00:01:48,977
The strength my legs can't contain...

48
00:01:48,977 --> 00:01:50,347
all went to my upper body.

49
00:01:50,607 --> 00:01:52,047
My upper body is angry.

50
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:53,377
Let me summarize.

51
00:01:53,377 --> 00:01:55,777
Jong Kook wont' be able to chase you down.

52
00:01:55,777 --> 00:01:56,877
However, he will end you if you come at him.

53
00:01:57,477 --> 00:01:58,477
Understood?

54
00:01:58,477 --> 00:02:00,347
- That's scarier. - Keep that in mind.

55
00:02:00,347 --> 00:02:01,677
- That's scarier. - That's scarier.

56
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:04,877
So Min, you have news.

57
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:06,807
She will finally move to Yongsan.

58
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,877
Please keep it quiet.

59
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:09,977
She bought an apartment.

60
00:02:09,977 --> 00:02:11,047
Please don't do this.

61
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,277
- Let's have a housewarming party. - I won't reveal where I live.

62
00:02:12,277 --> 00:02:14,517
She recently filmed a commercial.

63
00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:17,517
She used her income from it as seed money...

64
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:19,477
to buy an apartment of her dreams.

65
00:02:19,477 --> 00:02:20,977
80 percent of it is a loan.

66
00:02:20,977 --> 00:02:22,677
80 percent of it is a loan.

67
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:25,247
Still, So Min has dreamed...

68
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:28,277
of moving out of her parents’ place.

69
00:02:28,277 --> 00:02:30,247
She managed to do that four months after joining the show.

70
00:02:30,247 --> 00:02:31,247
That's incredible.

71
00:02:31,247 --> 00:02:33,907
She showed me a risk upon arrival.

72
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:36,307
- You mean list, not risk. - A list.

73
00:02:36,577 --> 00:02:38,277
- A list. - He embarrasses me.

74
00:02:38,277 --> 00:02:40,877
- The brothers are the same. - He embarrasses me.

75
00:02:41,177 --> 00:02:42,477
- A list. - My goodness.

76
00:02:42,477 --> 00:02:43,547
He shocked me.

77
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:46,447
You have a risk.

78
00:02:46,447 --> 00:02:49,507
She showed me a list of items she needs.

79
00:02:49,777 --> 00:02:51,147
She wants a gift from everyone.

80
00:02:51,147 --> 00:02:52,777
- Everyone should give her a gift. - That's right.

81
00:02:52,777 --> 00:02:54,447
- That's right. - Also,

82
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:56,607
we should congratulate Se Chan.

83
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,777
He got to spend time with Na Eun.

84
00:02:58,777 --> 00:02:59,777
That's right.

85
00:02:59,777 --> 00:03:01,177
- It was a short-lived love. - Did something happen?

86
00:03:01,177 --> 00:03:02,247
(He was Na Eun's butler during the first Couple Race.)

87
00:03:03,177 --> 00:03:06,647
(Na Eun found a place in Se Chan's heart from the start.)

88
00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:10,047
(I was happy to be your butler.)

89
00:03:10,047 --> 00:03:11,577
Na Eun appeared in his dream.

90
00:03:11,577 --> 00:03:12,877
- Did she appear in your dream? - Yes, she did.

91
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:14,747
- What did she say? - I don't remember,

92
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:18,747
but I led her and took her to places.

93
00:03:19,947 --> 00:03:22,807
Did you want to do that in your dream?

94
00:03:23,577 --> 00:03:24,677
- You... - I keep thinking about her.

95
00:03:25,077 --> 00:03:26,677
- Never mind. - What is it?

96
00:03:26,677 --> 00:03:28,077
(What did Kwang Soo want to say?)

97
00:03:28,677 --> 00:03:30,277
- What is it? - I had the same experience.

98
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,477
- He had the same experience. - He had the same experience.

99
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:32,807
- It happens when I fall in love. - She appears in your dream.

100
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:34,577
- Let's talk later. - Did you have a similar dream?

101
00:03:34,577 --> 00:03:35,877
The dream made me lose my hair.

102
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:38,547
If it goes on,

103
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,677
- you will lose your hair. - Do you become stressed out?

104
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:42,277
- Yes. - You feel like you are dating.

105
00:03:42,407 --> 00:03:44,107
Haha is quite used to the experience.

106
00:03:44,777 --> 00:03:45,777
I am envious.

107
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:48,077
In any case,

108
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:50,277
you will soon see...

109
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:51,907
who will go on a trip.

110
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:57,377
(They will have the winner of A Place for 1 Percent today.)

111
00:03:58,777 --> 00:04:01,177
- Today is the day. - What should I do?

112
00:04:01,177 --> 00:04:05,807
(Seok Jin, Haha, and So Min are at a high risk.)

113
00:04:06,277 --> 00:04:08,677
It will be decided today.

114
00:04:08,677 --> 00:04:10,607
(They will go on a trip if they receive another Sticker.)

115
00:04:10,607 --> 00:04:11,647
Bye, So Min.

116
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:13,177
Don't you want to go on a trip?

117
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:14,347
I won't go alone.

118
00:04:14,347 --> 00:04:15,977
That's right. I need to be on your good side.

119
00:04:15,977 --> 00:04:17,607
As you have guessed,

120
00:04:17,677 --> 00:04:20,547
we will have a final mission to decide who receives a penalty.

121
00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:21,547
Okay.

122
00:04:21,547 --> 00:04:23,407
(The final mission to decide who receives the penalty)

123
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:25,907
Currently, Seok Jin, Haha, and So Min...

124
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:29,477
have two I Go Stickers each and are most likely to be chosen.

125
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,077
Before we have the final mission,

126
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:33,407
we will go over...

127
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,647
the six finalists of A Place for 1 Percent.

128
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,777
Okay.

129
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,977
(The 6 finalists of A Place for 1 Percent)

130
00:04:40,977 --> 00:04:41,977
I am nervous.

131
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:46,077
Kim Cho Rong's recommendation, Catacombs of Paris.

132
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,407
(Catacombs of Paris)

133
00:04:47,877 --> 00:04:51,607
(The mysterious underground ossuaries in the heart of Paris)

134
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:54,207
(The 300km-long underground tunnel is filled with human bones.)

135
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:57,447
Unlike her cute name,

136
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,877
Cho Rong recommended us a scary travel destination.

137
00:05:00,877 --> 00:05:03,447
Abril's recommendation, Copper Canyon of Mexico.

138
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:04,507
My goodness.

139
00:05:04,777 --> 00:05:06,507
I can't go there.

140
00:05:06,777 --> 00:05:09,777
(It's a frightening collaboration between a canyon and a cliff.)

141
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:14,977
(With the zipline across the canyon, face your fear of heights.)

142
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:19,377
Hong Se Hee's recommendation, Giant Canyon Swing in the US.

143
00:05:19,507 --> 00:05:21,277
- I remember that one. - It will give you a heart attack.

144
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:23,177
- I can't ride it. - It will give you a heart attack.

145
00:05:23,677 --> 00:05:26,677
(A swing on the 400m-high cliff goes up to the sky.)

146
00:05:26,677 --> 00:05:31,047
(It's a legendary swing even the architect only rode once.)

147
00:05:31,507 --> 00:05:34,647
Park Ji Ni's recommendation, Crater of Diamonds State Park.

148
00:05:34,647 --> 00:05:35,647
Let's go there.

149
00:05:35,647 --> 00:05:36,977
- I would go there. - I would go there.

150
00:05:36,977 --> 00:05:37,977
I wouldn't mind going to Crater of Diamonds State Park.

151
00:05:37,977 --> 00:05:40,377
- It would be a nice trip. - I would go there.

152
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:45,907
(If you find a diamond, it will be yours.)

153
00:05:45,907 --> 00:05:48,507
(The land of opportunity is open to anyone...)

154
00:05:48,507 --> 00:05:50,607
(who pays 7 dollars for its entrance fee.)

155
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:52,747
Another candidate is Hammocking in Indonesia...

156
00:05:52,747 --> 00:05:54,407
which Bi Kyung has suggested.

157
00:05:54,407 --> 00:05:56,777
Are you talking about taking a nap in a hammock placed on a cliff?

158
00:05:56,777 --> 00:05:59,607
- That sounds risky. - That's too dangerous.

159
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:04,177
(A hammock is placed in between the two mountaintops.)

160
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:07,447
(They'll enjoy a thrilling nap in the air 2078m above the sea level.)

161
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:10,577
(Clouds will be their blankets. It's both romantic and thrilling.)

162
00:06:10,677 --> 00:06:12,747
- Who recommended it again? - Goo Bi Kyung.

163
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:15,077
You better watch your back.

164
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:17,077
(Join us, Bi Kyung.)

165
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,507
The last candidate is...

166
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:21,277
the manual wooden cable car in Indonesia...

167
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:24,177
which has been recommended by Syifa.

168
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:27,447
(The waves are menacing as if they'll swallow everything.)

169
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:32,507
(They'll have to move above the waves alone on the cable car.)

170
00:06:32,947 --> 00:06:37,247
(Today, the members to go on the dangerous trip will be decided.)

171
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:39,407
All right, so today's final mission is called...

172
00:06:39,547 --> 00:06:41,747
I Go, Stop Race.

173
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:43,907
(The final mission is called I Go, Stop Race.)

174
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:47,307
Seok Jin, Haha, and So Min currently have...

175
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:49,377
two I Go Stickers each.

176
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:51,407
They'll be Dud Man...

177
00:06:51,407 --> 00:06:53,107
to determine the result of today's race.

178
00:06:53,107 --> 00:06:57,577
(These three members are the Dud Men to determine today's race.)

179
00:06:57,607 --> 00:07:01,007
(The name sounds suspicious enough. What will be their mission?)

180
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:02,907
All right, please wear this badge.

181
00:07:02,907 --> 00:07:04,647
- Dud Men gets to wear something. - They get something.

182
00:07:04,647 --> 00:07:06,347
I guess they'll be our team leaders.

183
00:07:06,847 --> 00:07:08,777
Do we have to win their favors from now on?

184
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:10,707
(Are they the team leaders for today or the members to go on the trip?)

185
00:07:10,707 --> 00:07:11,777
Still...

186
00:07:12,107 --> 00:07:14,077
Still, at least 1 of us 3 may not go on the trip.

187
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:15,707
- You're right. - At least one of us.

188
00:07:15,707 --> 00:07:17,677
I hope it'll be two among us.

189
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:19,677
- You never know. - Gosh, that stings!

190
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,747
(I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.)

191
00:07:22,747 --> 00:07:24,347
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

192
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:25,877
(I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.)

193
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:27,977
- Hey! - Goodness.

194
00:07:27,977 --> 00:07:29,777
How many times has it been?

195
00:07:29,777 --> 00:07:32,647
Seok Jin is aware of it, but he still lets Jae Seok do it.

196
00:07:32,647 --> 00:07:34,107
He was waiting for it.

197
00:07:34,107 --> 00:07:36,077
He was waiting for you to prick him.

198
00:07:36,807 --> 00:07:37,807
He was aware of it.

199
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:39,377
(It's a must to see their teasing each other now.)

200
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:41,477
Some of our viewers wait to see me tease him.

201
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:43,677
I've succeeded to tease him today as well!

202
00:07:43,677 --> 00:07:46,047
(He clears his self mission to tease Seok Jin for today.)

203
00:07:46,177 --> 00:07:47,247
Today,

204
00:07:47,507 --> 00:07:49,877
you will go through the race in two teams.

205
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:51,907
At the end of the race,

206
00:07:51,907 --> 00:07:54,607
the team with fewer Dud Men will win.

207
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:58,677
(The team with fewer Dud Men will win today's race.)

208
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:01,347
After each mission, the winning team will get to have a chance...

209
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:04,907
to change one of your team members.

210
00:08:05,807 --> 00:08:06,977
If you choose to switch members,

211
00:08:06,977 --> 00:08:09,177
each team'll play the roulette that has members' names written on it.

212
00:08:09,177 --> 00:08:12,407
You'll pick one member to change by playing it.

213
00:08:12,407 --> 00:08:14,307
Or you may choose not to change members.

214
00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:18,147
This is going to be fun.

215
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:19,807
So 1 of 3 will go for certain.

216
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:21,377
If there's 2 Dud Men in 1 team, they'll have to go on the trip?

217
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:22,847
(Dud Men in the losing team will go on the trip.)

218
00:08:23,247 --> 00:08:25,177
Today's missions will be fierce.

219
00:08:25,647 --> 00:08:28,807
Two Dud Men in the losing team will be given a I Go Sticker each.

220
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:31,207
- Dud Men will... - There's no need for us to do hard.

221
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,147
choose whom to go on the trip with...

222
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,677
- Within their team? - within their team.

223
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:36,807
- That's scary. - Within their team.

224
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,377
- They'll take Dud Men out. - This is incredible.

225
00:08:38,377 --> 00:08:39,547
- Kwang Soo... - This is bad.

226
00:08:39,547 --> 00:08:41,077
It's a chance for Kwang Soo to survive though.

227
00:08:41,077 --> 00:08:43,577
Thank you. I'll do my best.

228
00:08:43,577 --> 00:08:44,747
I'll put all my effort.

229
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:46,107
(He's been penalized for 7 years, but not today.)

230
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:48,417
If you win today's race, you won't go on the trip for certain.

231
00:08:48,547 --> 00:08:49,647
- Right. - You're right.

232
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:51,807
Okay, I'll be really serious today.

233
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:54,417
(Will his dream to be exempted from the penalty come true?)

234
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:57,307
Before the race, you'll be divided into two teams by this mission.

235
00:08:57,307 --> 00:08:59,077
It's called Up and Down.

236
00:08:59,077 --> 00:09:00,747
- What is it about? - I'm serious today.

237
00:09:00,777 --> 00:09:01,847
- This? - Serious.

238
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:03,417
(What is it about?)

239
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:05,777
All the members will either sit down or stand up...

240
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:08,247
with the count of three.

241
00:09:08,477 --> 00:09:10,977
As soon as there are four members who are standing up,

242
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:12,307
the mission will come to an end.

243
00:09:12,307 --> 00:09:15,877
- I'll say, "Up and Down, 1, 2, 3." - Okay.

244
00:09:16,107 --> 00:09:17,107
Up and Down.

245
00:09:17,107 --> 00:09:18,807
(It's the most important part of the race.)

246
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:19,807
One.

247
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:22,007
Two.

248
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:23,147
(The fewer Dud Men are in your team, the better it will be.)

249
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:24,307
Three.

250
00:09:24,307 --> 00:09:25,417
(The fewer Dud Men are in your team, the better it will be.)

251
00:09:25,477 --> 00:09:27,917
(How will these 3 Dud Men be divided in teams?)

252
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:30,677
Up and Down, 1, 2, 3.

253
00:09:31,377 --> 00:09:35,177
(Seok Jin stands up while Haha and So Min stay seated.)

254
00:09:35,177 --> 00:09:36,947
Thank goodness.

255
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:38,577
- We're a team! Wait. - Gosh, I'm going crazy.

256
00:09:39,007 --> 00:09:40,977
- Are we a team? - I'm the only Dud Man here.

257
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:45,847
- We have the unluckiest members. - Hold on.

258
00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:47,677
- Let's win. - Let go!

259
00:09:47,677 --> 00:09:50,347
- Let me go! - I can't go on the trip!

260
00:09:50,547 --> 00:09:54,107
I can already see who'll go on the trip with Seok Jin.

261
00:09:54,247 --> 00:09:55,807
I'm confident in this team.

262
00:09:55,947 --> 00:09:58,047
- I can do this. - All right.

263
00:09:58,047 --> 00:10:01,377
Ji Hyo, Jong Kook, So Min, and Haha...

264
00:10:01,377 --> 00:10:03,277
will be in Team Black with two Dud Men.

265
00:10:03,877 --> 00:10:07,307
Seok Jin, Jae Seok, Se Chan, and Kwang Soo...

266
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,147
will be in Team White with one Dud Man.

267
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:11,547
If the race ends as it is,

268
00:10:11,547 --> 00:10:14,677
- Team Black'll all go on the trip. - The game ended at once.

269
00:10:14,677 --> 00:10:16,147
- Right. - That's right.

270
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:17,417
Let's keep things as it is.

271
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,547
- Let's keep things this way. - Great.

272
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:20,777
- Let's do that. - Really.

273
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:22,107
- Don't betray us. - It's all right.

274
00:10:22,107 --> 00:10:23,947
- Let's do that. - Let's not change members.

275
00:10:23,947 --> 00:10:25,577
It can't stay this way until the end.

276
00:10:25,577 --> 00:10:26,977
- It's not possible. - It can't be.

277
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:31,207
You'll be given a chance to switch members once every mission.

278
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:32,807
We never know yet.

279
00:10:32,807 --> 00:10:35,177
- We never know. - This is amusing.

280
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,477
(Until when will these two teams remain the same?)

281
00:10:39,107 --> 00:10:40,177
I have a feeling...

282
00:10:40,177 --> 00:10:41,777
that my team will try to send me away if we win.

283
00:10:41,777 --> 00:10:43,147
It's you for certain.

284
00:10:43,147 --> 00:10:45,177
- The four of us are like family. - Just keep this in mind.

285
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,547
We'll win if the four of us stay in this team.

286
00:10:47,807 --> 00:10:49,977
- Then... - Seok Jin, you have to know this.

287
00:10:50,177 --> 00:10:51,677
You may stay the same all you want,

288
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:54,077
but if we send one of our Dud Men in the end, you'll be doomed.

289
00:10:54,547 --> 00:10:55,607
It'll be you.

290
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,777
Just get your gout treated already.

291
00:11:00,307 --> 00:11:01,777
I hope you'll recover soon.

292
00:11:02,677 --> 00:11:04,447
- I'm just saying it. - Focus on your treatment.

293
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:05,847
I have a point though.

294
00:11:06,147 --> 00:11:08,147
- This is frustrating. - Goodness.

295
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:09,347
Look at the color of our outfits.

296
00:11:09,347 --> 00:11:10,907
We're in the same team.

297
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:12,177
It's white.

298
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:13,507
- Seok Jin. - It's an angelic color.

299
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,107
We're unlucky, but we'll show them.

300
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,577
Let's show them what we can do.

301
00:11:16,577 --> 00:11:17,947
Am I supposed to trust you guys?

302
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:19,147
Goodness.

303
00:11:19,147 --> 00:11:21,407
You never know what they're thinking inside their outfits.

304
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:23,507
You can't see through their thoughts.

305
00:11:23,507 --> 00:11:25,307
Now that he can't use his legs freely, he's talking so freely.

306
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:27,247
He's using his mouth instead.

307
00:11:27,247 --> 00:11:28,747
He has abs on his tongue.

308
00:11:28,747 --> 00:11:31,577
- Come on. - He has abs on his tongue.

309
00:11:31,577 --> 00:11:35,007
(Jong Kook has trained his tongue through exercising squats.)

310
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:36,707
I'm serious.

311
00:11:37,147 --> 00:11:39,007
He holds a dumbbell with his tongue.

312
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:40,907
That's how he gained the abs on his tongue.

313
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:44,077
He even does tongue sit-ups. He exercises his tongue.

314
00:11:45,307 --> 00:11:47,747
You're all aware that your team members are very important.

315
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:50,607
Now, you'll play a game to win a Chance Card.

316
00:11:50,607 --> 00:11:52,407
- Okay. - This Chance Card...

317
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:54,677
- Do you think it'll be yours? - Goodness.

318
00:11:54,677 --> 00:11:57,277
- I may look forward to having it. - Do you think it'll be yours?

319
00:11:57,277 --> 00:12:00,247
This Chance Card will allow you...

320
00:12:00,747 --> 00:12:04,477
to spin the roulette again if you have to switch your member...

321
00:12:04,477 --> 00:12:07,107
with a Dud Man or you're not satisfied with the result.

322
00:12:07,277 --> 00:12:08,407
We must win this.

323
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:10,507
- It's a must. - We must win this card.

324
00:12:10,507 --> 00:12:11,677
This Chance Card is huge...

325
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:13,977
because if Team White wins it, they can send Seok Jin over...

326
00:12:14,277 --> 00:12:15,877
to the other team.

327
00:12:15,877 --> 00:12:16,907
- Really? - Right.

328
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:18,907
- Then it's not great. - It's good for our team.

329
00:12:18,907 --> 00:12:20,007
Will you not choose to stay?

330
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,577
- It's good for our team. - We gets to spin again with it.

331
00:12:21,577 --> 00:12:23,477
Seok Jin seems to want to try that thing.

332
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:24,847
What was it, the swing?

333
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:26,177
What I meant is that I can't ride it.

334
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:28,347
I'll have terrible motion sickness if I ride that.

335
00:12:28,507 --> 00:12:29,807
Does it mean you can go to the charnel house?

336
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:31,077
- I can. - He can't.

337
00:12:31,077 --> 00:12:34,477
It'll be a huge mess if he does something wrong.

338
00:12:35,107 --> 00:12:36,777
- I'm okay with it. - It'll be his charnel house.

339
00:12:36,907 --> 00:12:39,607
- We have to avoid it. - It might be his charnel house.

340
00:12:39,977 --> 00:12:42,277
It might be his last place.

341
00:12:42,277 --> 00:12:43,307
So he can't go there.

342
00:12:43,307 --> 00:12:47,107
Well, it can be done at a right timing.

343
00:12:47,107 --> 00:12:48,207
He might find his place to rest in.

344
00:12:48,777 --> 00:12:50,647
(What are they talking about when he still has many days left?)

345
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:52,007
"It can be done at a right timing."

346
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,777
When he went to Japan...

347
00:12:53,777 --> 00:12:54,847
Take it easy.

348
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:56,407
- We're a team. - Goodness.

349
00:12:56,407 --> 00:12:58,107
(Long live Seok Jin!)

350
00:12:58,107 --> 00:13:01,007
You'll start the game to win the Chance Card.

351
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:04,607
You'll play Jae Seok's Game that's trendy nowadays.

352
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:06,477
(Jae Seok's Game)

353
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:09,807
(It's a success if they answer randomly...)

354
00:13:09,807 --> 00:13:12,547
(for 3 consecutive times to the producer's questions.)

355
00:13:12,547 --> 00:13:16,977
(It's become even more amusing ever since its name got chanced.)

356
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,247
All right. Starting from So Min.

357
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:21,147
(3 members from each team will play the 1st round.)

358
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:23,047
- So Min, you need to focus. - Ji Hyo.

359
00:13:23,377 --> 00:13:24,777
- Focus. - This game is so hard.

360
00:13:24,777 --> 00:13:25,877
- Hey, this... - Ready,

361
00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:28,447
set, go.

362
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,707
What do you like to do the most recently?

363
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:31,047
Thank you for visiting us.

364
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:32,307
What's the word you often say?

365
00:13:32,307 --> 00:13:33,407
Jung Chul Min.

366
00:13:33,407 --> 00:13:34,577
(That's the producer's name.)

367
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:37,047
(Why would you say his name often?)

368
00:13:37,047 --> 00:13:38,407
- That makes sense. - Why?

369
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:40,947
Do you say his name often to win him over?

370
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:42,877
- So Min. - She must like him.

371
00:13:42,877 --> 00:13:44,307
- That's not it. - She likes him.

372
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:46,607
Don't be so sly trying to win him over.

373
00:13:46,977 --> 00:13:50,307
Why are you looking at her so dearly?

374
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:51,307
You're mistaken.

375
00:13:51,307 --> 00:13:52,677
I know you have a girlfriend.

376
00:13:52,677 --> 00:13:54,407
They might argue over this later.

377
00:13:54,577 --> 00:13:56,647
It's Ji Hyo's turn now.

378
00:13:57,507 --> 00:14:00,047
- You can do it! - Be confident.

379
00:14:00,677 --> 00:14:02,077
- Ready. - Don't try to think.

380
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:05,007
Set, go.

381
00:14:05,007 --> 00:14:07,007
- How will you be after 10 years? - 6 times 5 is 15.

382
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:09,047
- What do you want to be afterlife? - 6 times 3 is 18.

383
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,477
What's your favorite math formula?

384
00:14:11,647 --> 00:14:13,807
(Oh, dear.)

385
00:14:13,807 --> 00:14:15,077
What's your favorite math formula?

386
00:14:16,347 --> 00:14:18,307
(Ji Hyo fails.)

387
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:19,377
That was witty.

388
00:14:19,377 --> 00:14:21,347
- He improvised it. - He didn't follow the script.

389
00:14:21,347 --> 00:14:22,607
(He's so meticulous!)

390
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:24,407
- He didn't follow the script. - He put down the script.

391
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:27,007
This game keeps being upgraded.

392
00:14:27,877 --> 00:14:31,177
(When she answered in calculations, he improvised to change questions.)

393
00:14:31,177 --> 00:14:33,347
He put down the script and improvised his question.

394
00:14:33,347 --> 00:14:34,477
That was so cool.

395
00:14:34,477 --> 00:14:36,377
That was cool. I admit it.

396
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:38,847
- Haha, we only have you. - That was great.

397
00:14:39,477 --> 00:14:41,807
- Okay, I'll do my best. - You can do this.

398
00:14:42,277 --> 00:14:43,877
- Ready. - Let's go.

399
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:45,347
Set, go.

400
00:14:45,347 --> 00:14:47,247
- How'll you name your third child? - 6 times 4 is 24.

401
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:50,407
(Wrong)

402
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:51,877
- Why? - That makes sense.

403
00:14:51,877 --> 00:14:54,977
(Didn't you say you'd name your third child "6 times 4 is 24"?)

404
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,347
It's my baby's name!

405
00:14:56,677 --> 00:14:58,047
- I know. - What...

406
00:14:58,347 --> 00:14:59,947
- Hey, 24. - It's my...

407
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,547
- It makes sense. - Why would I name...

408
00:15:01,707 --> 00:15:04,607
Why would I name my baby "6 times 4 is 24"?

409
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:05,977
6 times 4 is 24!

410
00:15:05,977 --> 00:15:08,407
- Come to your senses! - 6 times 4 is 24!

411
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:10,277
It doesn't make sense at all!

412
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:12,007
- That sounds cool. - It's unfair.

413
00:15:12,407 --> 00:15:15,477
- Let this one slide, seriously. - All right.

414
00:15:15,477 --> 00:15:17,247
I'll give you another chance then.

415
00:15:17,677 --> 00:15:18,677
Ready,

416
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,307
set, go.

417
00:15:21,307 --> 00:15:22,607
What comes in your mind if you see Jae Seok?

418
00:15:22,607 --> 00:15:23,947
1 plus 1 equals 2.

419
00:15:24,477 --> 00:15:26,277
What do you wish to give your mother-in-law as a gift?

420
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:29,947
- Gift... - Gift voucher?

421
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:31,147
(Gift vouchers are the best gift for your mother-in-law!)

422
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:32,747
- Gift voucher. - I'll present you this time.

423
00:15:32,747 --> 00:15:34,847
I'll make sure to give it to you this time.

424
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:35,977
Gift voucher!

425
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,577
The producer asked about his family.

426
00:15:38,577 --> 00:15:40,977
(Haha fails to answer randomly to his family-related questions.)

427
00:15:40,977 --> 00:15:42,607
- Gift voucher! - I'll give it to you.

428
00:15:43,007 --> 00:15:44,147
I love you!

429
00:15:44,147 --> 00:15:45,907
(Team Black fails to succeed in the 1st round.)

430
00:15:46,377 --> 00:15:48,147
- Okay. - Let's go.

431
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,107
- One of us should succeed. - One of us.

432
00:15:50,107 --> 00:15:51,347
Just one of us.

433
00:15:51,347 --> 00:15:52,707
We'll decide.

434
00:15:52,707 --> 00:15:53,777
(If Team White wins, they'll win the Chance Card.)

435
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:55,607
6 times 4 is 24. All right.

436
00:15:55,777 --> 00:15:57,177
- Se Chan. - Yes.

437
00:15:57,177 --> 00:15:58,177
(Se Chan's turn)

438
00:15:58,177 --> 00:16:00,877
- Stay cool. - Ready, set, go.

439
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:01,947
What does Son Na Eun remind you of?

440
00:16:01,947 --> 00:16:03,007
Son Na Eun.

441
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:05,407
(Na Eun reminds him of her.)

442
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:10,677
(All I can think of is you.)

443
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:12,747
- Nice. - What?

444
00:16:12,747 --> 00:16:14,077
I love it.

445
00:16:14,077 --> 00:16:15,447
Na Eun...

446
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:16,807
Is she all you can think of?

447
00:16:17,307 --> 00:16:21,447
(I don't mind losing a game as long as I have memories of you.)

448
00:16:21,877 --> 00:16:24,277
My head is full of her.

449
00:16:24,707 --> 00:16:27,207
It's full of Na Eun.

450
00:16:27,207 --> 00:16:29,347
All right. It's Kwang Soo's turn.

451
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:33,507
- Okay. - Ready, set, go.

452
00:16:33,507 --> 00:16:34,647
What do you call your girlfriend?

453
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:35,707
I'm sorry.

454
00:16:35,707 --> 00:16:37,507
(I'm sorry.)

455
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:40,877
- Hold on. - Why are you so sorry?

456
00:16:41,347 --> 00:16:46,977
(Were you looking for your girlfriend in the labyrinth?)

457
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,677
(Why are you so sorry?)

458
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,707
I call my girlfriend that?

459
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:55,207
It's not even Korean.

460
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:57,877
My third child is called 6 times 4 is 24.

461
00:16:58,247 --> 00:17:00,607
- What about Thank You? - I love you, I'm Sorry.

462
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:02,847
- Is it Thank You? - That'd be weird.

463
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:04,347
It sounds good.

464
00:17:04,347 --> 00:17:07,117
It's not even Korean.

465
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:08,777
I'm Sorry?

466
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,347
- If Jae Seok fails, - It's Jae Seok's turn.

467
00:17:11,347 --> 00:17:12,847
- Look how I do it. - Team White will...

468
00:17:12,847 --> 00:17:14,077
Jae Seok.

469
00:17:14,077 --> 00:17:15,777
- You've never succeeded. - Of course.

470
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:17,047
- You've never succeeded, right? - No.

471
00:17:17,047 --> 00:17:18,617
- Succeed today. - Today, I'll succeed.

472
00:17:18,617 --> 00:17:20,617
(Jae Seok is determined to succeed today.)

473
00:17:20,977 --> 00:17:22,807
- This is our last chance. - All right.

474
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:26,447
Ready, set, go.

475
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:27,877
What did you say when you proposed?

476
00:17:27,877 --> 00:17:29,647
Well... Toad.

477
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:32,617
(Toad)

478
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:36,047
(Will you be my toad?)

479
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:37,947
I was going to say, "toad".

480
00:17:38,977 --> 00:17:40,347
This is not okay.

481
00:17:40,347 --> 00:17:42,577
- Did you say, "toad", to her? - Gosh.

482
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:44,447
- Did you say that? - This is too much.

483
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,647
"Toad" is a bit too...

484
00:17:46,647 --> 00:17:48,007
I can't believe this.

485
00:17:48,007 --> 00:17:49,947
- It's too difficult. - Then...

486
00:17:49,947 --> 00:17:51,547
I'll give you another chance. I won't ask about your family.

487
00:17:51,547 --> 00:17:54,047
- Don't ask about our family. - Don't ask about our family.

488
00:17:54,547 --> 00:17:55,947
I have answers in mind.

489
00:17:55,947 --> 00:17:57,177
Ready, set, go.

490
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:58,707
What do you want to eat to stay healthy in the summer?

491
00:17:59,147 --> 00:18:02,377
(Well...)

492
00:18:02,377 --> 00:18:03,547
Why do you make that sound?

493
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:05,747
(Why do you keep making that sound?)

494
00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:07,077
Why do you make that sound?

495
00:18:07,077 --> 00:18:09,877
- Why do you make that sound? - What?

496
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:11,977
Didn't I succeed?

497
00:18:11,977 --> 00:18:14,447
Why do you keep making that sound?

498
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:19,117
(He can't stop making that sound.)

499
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:22,347
- My goodness. - You failed.

500
00:18:22,547 --> 00:18:23,847
Let's play fair.

501
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:25,617
- Let's play another game. - Let's play another game.

502
00:18:25,617 --> 00:18:26,877
Why don't we play the multiplication game?

503
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:29,077
Should we play a game where you have to say the wrong answer?

504
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:30,617
- Okay. Let's do that. - Ji Hyo is on the other team.

505
00:18:30,617 --> 00:18:32,147
She said, "6 times 5 equals 15."

506
00:18:32,147 --> 00:18:35,407
(The problematic player, Ji Hyo, is on the other team.)

507
00:18:36,307 --> 00:18:39,807
(Ji Hyo once answered, "6 times 5 equals 15.")

508
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:42,347
Let's go. Let's start from Team Black.

509
00:18:42,347 --> 00:18:43,977
Just say the last digit wrong.

510
00:18:43,977 --> 00:18:45,077
The rules are simple.

511
00:18:45,077 --> 00:18:47,007
You have to say only the last digit wrong.

512
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:48,877
If you don't say the answer right away, it doesn't count.

513
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,807
So Min will play first,

514
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:52,477
- and Haha will play last. - Okay.

515
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:54,047
- Here we go. - Here we go.

516
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:56,947
- Let's play the multiplication game - Let's play the multiplication game

517
00:18:56,947 --> 00:18:58,547
- 6 times 3? - 30.

518
00:19:00,677 --> 00:19:01,777
Fail.

519
00:19:01,777 --> 00:19:03,677
(She fails.)

520
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:06,117
- Fail. - Hey.

521
00:19:07,277 --> 00:19:09,507
6 times 3 equals 24.

522
00:19:09,507 --> 00:19:12,007
You just have to finish one round.

523
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:13,047
Let's finish one round.

524
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:14,777
You just have to finish one round.

525
00:19:14,777 --> 00:19:15,777
- All right. - Who should start?

526
00:19:15,777 --> 00:19:17,347
Seok Jin will play first.

527
00:19:17,347 --> 00:19:19,047
If we succeed, we'll win.

528
00:19:20,147 --> 00:19:25,577
(This is the last chance to win the Chance Card.)

529
00:19:25,877 --> 00:19:27,577
(Will Team White win?)

530
00:19:27,577 --> 00:19:29,807
- Let's play the multiplication game - Let's play the multiplication game

531
00:19:29,807 --> 00:19:31,347
- 8 times 8? - 62.

532
00:19:31,617 --> 00:19:33,177
- 6 times 4? - 21.

533
00:19:33,307 --> 00:19:34,947
- 7 times 5? - 38.

534
00:19:34,947 --> 00:19:35,947
2 times 9?

535
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:42,047
(Team White will win if Jae Seok succeeds.)

536
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,277
2 times 9?

537
00:19:44,307 --> 00:19:45,377
15.

538
00:19:45,377 --> 00:19:46,877
- 7 times 5? - 38.

539
00:19:46,877 --> 00:19:48,477
- 2 times 9? - 15.

540
00:19:48,847 --> 00:19:52,077
(Team White wins.)

541
00:19:52,077 --> 00:19:54,247
- We did it! - Team White wins.

542
00:19:54,247 --> 00:19:56,117
- We weren't slow. - We weren't.

543
00:19:56,747 --> 00:19:59,117
- I was determined. - Good job.

544
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:01,407
We were so desperate.

545
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,847
After spinning the roulette wheel,

546
00:20:03,847 --> 00:20:05,947
if you don't like the result, you can spin it one more time.

547
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:07,807
I did my best in the game,

548
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,377
but I can't benefit from it.

549
00:20:09,377 --> 00:20:10,647
You did a great job.

550
00:20:11,507 --> 00:20:12,777
Where are we?

551
00:20:12,847 --> 00:20:14,077
We're outdoors.

552
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,947
There are dice.

553
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:18,477
- There are dice. - There are dice.

554
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:21,407
(What mission will they be given?)

555
00:20:21,947 --> 00:20:24,847
- Do you see the dice? - Yes.

556
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:26,847
You'll have lunch soon.

557
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:30,177
Before that, you'll carry out the first mission.

558
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:34,307
(They can change their team members.)

559
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:35,847
- I like it. - Okay.

560
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:37,147
Are we already saying goodbye?

561
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,077
- Don't think too much. - We won't.

562
00:20:39,077 --> 00:20:40,277
If we stay this way, we'll win.

563
00:20:41,147 --> 00:20:45,647
The mission is called, "Dice Go, Stop".

564
00:20:46,507 --> 00:20:48,877
You'll take turns in throwing the dice.

565
00:20:48,877 --> 00:20:51,807
The team with the sum of the dice...

566
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:54,507
closest to 10 will win.

567
00:20:56,207 --> 00:20:57,807
After throwing the dice,

568
00:20:57,807 --> 00:21:02,377
decide if you want the other team to continue or stop.

569
00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:05,747
If the sum exceeds 10, you'll lose.

570
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,807
That sounds fun.

571
00:21:08,807 --> 00:21:10,947
(They have to carefully decide if they'll stop the other team.)

572
00:21:10,947 --> 00:21:13,807
(It's the perfect chance to send Dud Men to the other team.)

573
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:15,677
Please decide who will play first.

574
00:21:15,677 --> 00:21:16,677
Who should play first?

575
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:18,047
It might be better to play first.

576
00:21:18,047 --> 00:21:19,347
Let's play rock–paper–scissors.

577
00:21:19,347 --> 00:21:20,547
- Should we do that? - Yes.

578
00:21:20,777 --> 00:21:22,777
- Rock–paper–scissors. - Rock–paper–scissors.

579
00:21:22,777 --> 00:21:24,907
Don't sound so angry.

580
00:21:25,147 --> 00:21:26,577
- Are you angry? - No.

581
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,947
Why did he get angry while saying, "rock–paper–scissors"?

582
00:21:28,947 --> 00:21:31,617
Rock–paper–scissors.

583
00:21:32,147 --> 00:21:34,907
(Are you pulling my leg?)

584
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:36,047
I'm thinking.

585
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:37,947
(Jong Kook is already angry.)

586
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:40,177
- I mean... - Why do you need to think?

587
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:42,777
- Why do you need to think? - I have to.

588
00:21:42,777 --> 00:21:44,807
- Okay. - Okay.

589
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:46,777
- Rock–paper–scissors. - Rock–paper–scissors.

590
00:21:46,777 --> 00:21:48,847
Rock–paper–scissors. Okay.

591
00:21:48,847 --> 00:21:49,907
Hey.

592
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:51,677
Ji Hyo, you go first.

593
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,007
They have so many lucky members.

594
00:21:53,007 --> 00:21:54,477
A four is a good one.

595
00:21:54,477 --> 00:21:55,547
Good luck.

596
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:58,407
- They have so many lucky members. - A four is a good one.

597
00:21:59,307 --> 00:22:01,247
- A four is good. - It's good.

598
00:22:01,477 --> 00:22:03,847
Ji Hyo, get a four.

599
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,077
Ji Hyo, throw the dice.

600
00:22:06,077 --> 00:22:08,077
(Please get a 4.)

601
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:10,647
(If she gets a 4,)

602
00:22:10,647 --> 00:22:13,147
(it'll be a good start.)

603
00:22:13,647 --> 00:22:15,207
A four.

604
00:22:15,207 --> 00:22:16,577
(She got a 4.)

605
00:22:18,977 --> 00:22:21,607
It's a four. You're crazy.

606
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:24,007
- Amazing. - You're crazy.

607
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:27,407
What is with her?

608
00:22:27,977 --> 00:22:29,007
Please decide between Go and Stop.

609
00:22:29,007 --> 00:22:30,207
- Go. - Go, definitely.

610
00:22:30,207 --> 00:22:31,747
My goodness.

611
00:22:31,907 --> 00:22:33,607
- You're unbelievable. - You're amazing.

612
00:22:33,607 --> 00:22:35,047
We can do this.

613
00:22:35,847 --> 00:22:38,077
- They're so lucky. - It's okay.

614
00:22:38,277 --> 00:22:40,107
- Don't feel burdened. - A four is good.

615
00:22:40,107 --> 00:22:41,707
(They loved a 4.)

616
00:22:41,707 --> 00:22:43,847
(Then I will...)

617
00:22:44,047 --> 00:22:45,277
Nice, it's a six.

618
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,107
Why is it nice?

619
00:22:48,107 --> 00:22:49,747
- It's not? - Why is it nice?

620
00:22:50,607 --> 00:22:53,577
(Isn't a bigger number better?)

621
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:56,847
(With a 5 or 6 in the next round, they'll lose.)

622
00:22:56,947 --> 00:22:58,447
- I like big numbers. - Why is it nice?

623
00:22:58,447 --> 00:23:00,407
- We might lose. - Why are you so oblivious?

624
00:23:00,677 --> 00:23:02,047
I'm sorry.

625
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:06,547
You were the only happy one here.

626
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:08,777
You two should stay out of the game.

627
00:23:09,677 --> 00:23:11,647
(Me too?)

628
00:23:11,647 --> 00:23:14,077
- Why? - You're so bad.

629
00:23:15,147 --> 00:23:17,677
- Get a 6 and win. - I need a 6.

630
00:23:17,677 --> 00:23:18,747
Here we go.

631
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:20,607
Let's do this.

632
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,677
Let's go.

633
00:23:21,677 --> 00:23:22,777
(Confident)

634
00:23:23,947 --> 00:23:25,607
Wait. Hey!

635
00:23:25,907 --> 00:23:27,207
- It ended up on his foot. - It doesn't count.

636
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:29,007
- Give it to me. - Why did you do that?

637
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,207
It doesn't count.

638
00:23:30,207 --> 00:23:32,407
Why doesn't it count?

639
00:23:32,407 --> 00:23:34,347
Let me explain.

640
00:23:36,477 --> 00:23:38,807
(I won't explain in detail.)

641
00:23:38,807 --> 00:23:40,807
Let me tell you.

642
00:23:40,807 --> 00:23:43,207
In every game...

643
00:23:43,707 --> 00:23:47,777
(Jong Kook answers the question in an aggressive way.)

644
00:23:48,377 --> 00:23:49,577
In every game...

645
00:23:51,507 --> 00:23:52,977
In every game...

646
00:23:52,977 --> 00:23:54,547
Wait, why are you guys just watching?

647
00:23:54,547 --> 00:23:57,247
Why are you just watching?

648
00:23:57,247 --> 00:23:59,507
- I'm so relieved. - We're just like you.

649
00:23:59,507 --> 00:24:00,577
Fine.

650
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:02,247
(Who could stop him?)

651
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:04,407
Every game has this rule.

652
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:06,247
My goodness.

653
00:24:06,247 --> 00:24:07,247
(They got a 3.)

654
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:08,277
Go or Stop?

655
00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:09,547
- What is our sum? - It's seven.

656
00:24:09,547 --> 00:24:11,647
It's a bit risky.

657
00:24:11,647 --> 00:24:13,977
- We have get either 1, 2, or 3. - You have a 50-percent chance.

658
00:24:13,977 --> 00:24:15,607
You have a 50-percent chance.

659
00:24:15,607 --> 00:24:16,747
It's a 50-percent chance.

660
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:19,547
- Can you give us 10 seconds? - Okay.

661
00:24:19,547 --> 00:24:21,107
I'll just listen to you.

662
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:25,607
(What will Ji Hyo choose?)

663
00:24:25,607 --> 00:24:27,107
Stop.

664
00:24:27,577 --> 00:24:29,407
(Stop by all means.)

665
00:24:29,407 --> 00:24:31,747
(Settle at 7.)

666
00:24:31,747 --> 00:24:33,807
(Don't take risks.)

667
00:24:34,447 --> 00:24:35,547
We would...

668
00:24:35,547 --> 00:24:36,847
We would choose Go.

669
00:24:36,847 --> 00:24:38,247
Let's just stop.

670
00:24:38,347 --> 00:24:39,777
- We have the next round too. - You're right.

671
00:24:40,407 --> 00:24:41,907
- Let's go. - Let's go.

672
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:43,877
If you get a three...

673
00:24:44,177 --> 00:24:45,677
Kiss the dice.

674
00:24:45,677 --> 00:24:48,407
(They kiss the dice.)

675
00:24:48,507 --> 00:24:50,477
That was a bad idea.

676
00:24:51,347 --> 00:24:52,507
If you get a six...

677
00:24:52,677 --> 00:24:54,507
I don't believe I'll get a six.

678
00:24:55,707 --> 00:24:58,447
(I don't believe I'll get a six.)

679
00:24:58,447 --> 00:24:59,807
We just have to avoid a six.

680
00:25:00,807 --> 00:25:07,147
(I'll finish the game.)

681
00:25:10,707 --> 00:25:11,807
(It's a 6.)

682
00:25:12,207 --> 00:25:14,447
It exceeds 10. We win!

683
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:17,507
(I didn't believe I'd see a 6.)

684
00:25:17,507 --> 00:25:19,107
I told you.

685
00:25:20,447 --> 00:25:23,377
(Happy, sad)

686
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:28,607
Why did you get the dice dirty?

687
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:32,507
- What? - What?

688
00:25:32,507 --> 00:25:34,607
- What did you just say? - Our lips are dirty?

689
00:25:34,607 --> 00:25:36,707
- Our lips are not dirty. - What are you talking about?

690
00:25:36,947 --> 00:25:38,507
- How can you say that? - Let's continue.

691
00:25:38,507 --> 00:25:39,777
(Team Black wins.)

692
00:25:39,977 --> 00:25:42,207
Please. For the last time.

693
00:25:42,277 --> 00:25:44,747
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo, So Min. Please.

694
00:25:44,747 --> 00:25:46,077
- I won't do it again. - Hey.

695
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,307
Apologize to the viewers.

696
00:25:47,307 --> 00:25:49,707
You were so indecent. You really were.

697
00:25:49,707 --> 00:25:51,277
- You can't do that. - That's right, Kwang Soo.

698
00:25:51,347 --> 00:25:52,777
- Shame on you. - Hold on.

699
00:25:52,777 --> 00:25:54,507
I am only as honest as you are.

700
00:25:54,507 --> 00:25:56,807
(I am only as honest as you are.)

701
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:58,907
- How could you? - I learned this from you.

702
00:25:58,907 --> 00:26:00,277
Then slap me once.

703
00:26:00,577 --> 00:26:01,577
(Slapping)

704
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:02,947
Then slap me once.

705
00:26:03,577 --> 00:26:05,407
(He slaps Jae Seok without hesitating.)

706
00:26:05,407 --> 00:26:07,107
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

707
00:26:07,407 --> 00:26:09,107
We won't do that again.

708
00:26:09,107 --> 00:26:10,107
(It's delightful.)

709
00:26:10,177 --> 00:26:11,177
Well done.

710
00:26:11,247 --> 00:26:13,477
- We won't try to break rules again. - Kids are watching our show.

711
00:26:13,577 --> 00:26:15,407
- We won't try to break rules again. - That's right.

712
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,607
We mustn't do this.

713
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:18,347
- We won't do it again. - We won't do it again.

714
00:26:18,347 --> 00:26:19,807
(As they respect the rules...)

715
00:26:20,147 --> 00:26:21,377
Team Black wins.

716
00:26:22,307 --> 00:26:24,347
It's a variety show after all. It must be exciting anyway.

717
00:26:24,347 --> 00:26:25,777
Ji Hyo.

718
00:26:25,777 --> 00:26:27,507
- This is great. - It was a fun game.

719
00:26:27,507 --> 00:26:30,777
- Team Black can change a member. - We have to switch someone.

720
00:26:30,777 --> 00:26:31,777
- We have to. - I agree.

721
00:26:31,777 --> 00:26:33,447
- I wish Haha would go. - Either So Min or I…

722
00:26:33,447 --> 00:26:34,507
- has to go. - We'll deal with this.

723
00:26:34,507 --> 00:26:36,407
- That's how we can survive. - Will you change or not?

724
00:26:36,407 --> 00:26:38,547
- We will switch no matter what. - We have to try.

725
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:40,447
Who is going to spin the roulette?

726
00:26:40,907 --> 00:26:42,907
- The opposing team should spin it. - All right.

727
00:26:43,077 --> 00:26:44,507
We want either Ji Hyo or Jong Kook.

728
00:26:44,507 --> 00:26:47,577
(Team White wants either Ji Hyo or Jong Kook.)

729
00:26:48,077 --> 00:26:50,007
We want to change So Min.

730
00:26:50,577 --> 00:26:51,847
- No, it's Haha. - It's So Min.

731
00:26:51,847 --> 00:26:52,977
Haha.

732
00:26:54,107 --> 00:26:56,377
In 1, 2,

733
00:26:57,507 --> 00:26:58,677
- Three. Here we go. - Here it is!

734
00:26:58,677 --> 00:26:59,677
Please be So Min.

735
00:26:59,677 --> 00:27:01,847
(If it's Jong Kook or Ji Hyo, Team White has a better chance.)

736
00:27:01,847 --> 00:27:04,807
(If it's So Min or Haha, it will be favorable for Team Black.)

737
00:27:04,807 --> 00:27:06,407
- Please, please. - Be So Min.

738
00:27:07,307 --> 00:27:08,477
Please be So Min.

739
00:27:09,607 --> 00:27:10,907
- Ji Hyo! - It's Jong Kook.

740
00:27:10,977 --> 00:27:13,507
(Jong Kook is chosen.)

741
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:14,547
- It's Jong Kook. - Jong Kook!

742
00:27:14,607 --> 00:27:18,247
(Breaking News: Jong Kook Is Transferred to Team White.)

743
00:27:18,247 --> 00:27:20,307
- Come here. - I have to make sure I stay.

744
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:21,947
(We are doomed.)

745
00:27:21,947 --> 00:27:23,677
- We are doomed. - I have to make sure I stay.

746
00:27:23,677 --> 00:27:24,677
I just have to stay in this team.

747
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:26,477
- The chosen one is the unluckiest. - Jong Kook.

748
00:27:26,477 --> 00:27:28,107
I have to make sure I stay in this team. That's all.

749
00:27:28,307 --> 00:27:30,807
(Welcome, Jong Kook who is not a Dud Man.)

750
00:27:30,807 --> 00:27:32,047
- Jae Seok. - Why were you so mean before?

751
00:27:32,047 --> 00:27:33,047
- I don't know. - Jong Kook.

752
00:27:33,047 --> 00:27:34,807
I don't know who will be picked.

753
00:27:34,807 --> 00:27:35,947
- Good work. - Well done.

754
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:36,947
- Well done. - Great work.

755
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,407
- It was fun. - It was great.

756
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,107
If Seok Jin is chosen, it will be awesome.

757
00:27:41,477 --> 00:27:43,507
- That's right. - It will be amazing.

758
00:27:43,507 --> 00:27:45,377
(He plans to put all the Dud Men into Team Black.)

759
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:47,077
- If it's Seok Jin, it'll be great. - No way.

760
00:27:47,077 --> 00:27:48,077
(Shaking his head)

761
00:27:49,807 --> 00:27:52,477
The member who is picked now is the unluckiest.

762
00:27:52,477 --> 00:27:54,247
It can't be me. I don't want to go.

763
00:27:54,247 --> 00:27:55,277
I really don't want to go.

764
00:27:56,347 --> 00:27:57,377
Get ready.

765
00:27:57,607 --> 00:27:59,877
- Please! - If it's Seok Jin, it'll be great.

766
00:27:59,947 --> 00:28:01,577
We need either Kwang Soo or Se Chan.

767
00:28:01,577 --> 00:28:03,507
- No, it has to be Seok Jin. - If it's Seok Jin, it's perfect.

768
00:28:03,507 --> 00:28:05,047
No way. It won't be me. It can't be.

769
00:28:05,047 --> 00:28:06,377
Please be Seok Jin.

770
00:28:06,507 --> 00:28:08,207
- Please be Seok Jin. - No.

771
00:28:08,207 --> 00:28:09,207
It can't be him.

772
00:28:09,677 --> 00:28:12,047
- Seok Jin should be picked. - No, it won't be me.

773
00:28:12,047 --> 00:28:13,507
It has to be Seok Jin. Please.

774
00:28:13,507 --> 00:28:15,407
(Who is the unlucky member that will...)

775
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:16,707
(join Team Black?)

776
00:28:16,707 --> 00:28:17,707
- Be Seok Jin. - No.

777
00:28:17,707 --> 00:28:19,107
- No way. - Please be Seok Jin.

778
00:28:19,707 --> 00:28:20,947
- It's Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo!

779
00:28:20,947 --> 00:28:22,807
(Kwang Soo is picked.)

780
00:28:23,147 --> 00:28:24,277
- Be Seok Jin. - No.

781
00:28:24,677 --> 00:28:27,207
- It's Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo!

782
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:29,307
Kwang Soo, come quickly!

783
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:31,407
- Why were you so mean before? - Kwang Soo, hurry.

784
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:32,607
Don't ever bring in the roulette again.

785
00:28:32,607 --> 00:28:33,707
Okay!

786
00:28:33,707 --> 00:28:35,507
- Don't bring it in again. Please. - He's unbeatable.

787
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:38,377
Some can't do the multiplication, but I'm not good at the roulette.

788
00:28:39,507 --> 00:28:41,607
Please give them the team uniforms. They'll change now.

789
00:28:41,607 --> 00:28:42,607
(It's time to change uniforms.)

790
00:28:42,607 --> 00:28:43,607
He can't be saved.

791
00:28:43,707 --> 00:28:45,807
Look at him. He looks great in black.

792
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:46,847
Let's get it.

793
00:28:47,277 --> 00:28:49,777
- We have to change here? - Team White,

794
00:28:49,777 --> 00:28:51,807
you had a chance to spin the roulette one more time,

795
00:28:51,807 --> 00:28:53,577
but you decided that you won't use it now, right?

796
00:28:53,577 --> 00:28:54,577
(You won't use it?)

797
00:28:57,307 --> 00:28:58,877
Hold on! The roulette!

798
00:28:59,077 --> 00:29:00,847
- What is he talking about? - We'll spin it again!

799
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:02,977
- We'll use it. - No.

800
00:29:02,977 --> 00:29:03,977
- Give me that. - I used it. Hold on.

801
00:29:03,977 --> 00:29:05,307
- No. - I already used it.

802
00:29:05,347 --> 00:29:06,477
- I just used it! - Okay.

803
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:07,577
- I used it. - Disregard this.

804
00:29:07,577 --> 00:29:10,247
- Hey, look. - It was in my pocket!

805
00:29:10,407 --> 00:29:12,477
Give me that. Give it back.

806
00:29:12,977 --> 00:29:13,977
- Hold on. - He's...

807
00:29:13,977 --> 00:29:15,807
- We'll use it later. - You are one strange guy.

808
00:29:15,807 --> 00:29:16,877
Why would we use it now?

809
00:29:16,877 --> 00:29:18,477
- It's for the team! - Look at you, weirdo.

810
00:29:18,477 --> 00:29:19,977
This is for Team White. Why did you take it?

811
00:29:19,977 --> 00:29:21,577
You are a member of Team Black. Why did you do that?

812
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:22,847
What a funny guy.

813
00:29:22,847 --> 00:29:24,847
(Don't push it. I'm already mad as it is.)

814
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:28,507
Since this belongs to Team White, use it at a crucial moment.

815
00:29:28,507 --> 00:29:30,847
How can a moment be more crucial than now?

816
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:33,107
What color is your shirt?

817
00:29:33,677 --> 00:29:34,777
It's black.

818
00:29:35,077 --> 00:29:36,077
It's black, but...

819
00:29:37,507 --> 00:29:39,547
- Come to your spot. - That was close.

820
00:29:39,847 --> 00:29:41,707
No one really thought about that.

821
00:29:42,507 --> 00:29:45,407
Now, you will go inside and have your meal.

822
00:29:45,407 --> 00:29:46,407
Let's go in.

823
00:29:46,707 --> 00:29:48,847
(Since some switched teams,)

824
00:29:48,847 --> 00:29:51,047
(you can give us a meal without playing a game, right?)

825
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:55,047
For members who will travel to the place for one percent,

826
00:29:55,047 --> 00:29:58,577
we prepared a meal with three kinds of duck dishes to invigorate.

827
00:29:58,577 --> 00:29:59,747
- This is great. - Okay.

828
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,007
It looks really tasty.

829
00:30:01,577 --> 00:30:03,207
It does. Gosh, look at the roasted duck.

830
00:30:04,947 --> 00:30:06,907
- There are dice over there again. - Yes, there are.

831
00:30:07,047 --> 00:30:08,407
There are dice again.

832
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:09,877
(Is there another mission in the restaurant?)

833
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:12,807
You will play the game, Dice Go, Stop, which you played earlier.

834
00:30:12,807 --> 00:30:14,347
- Only the winning team... - I'm in!

835
00:30:14,347 --> 00:30:15,477
- can eat. - Okay.

836
00:30:15,477 --> 00:30:18,207
(Only the winning team of Dice Go, Stop can have the meal.)

837
00:30:18,347 --> 00:30:20,107
It's the game our team is the most confident at!

838
00:30:21,047 --> 00:30:22,077
Let's go.

839
00:30:22,247 --> 00:30:23,247
- Please throw a 6. - Be 6.

840
00:30:23,247 --> 00:30:24,707
- It's 2. - 2 is great.

841
00:30:24,707 --> 00:30:26,307
(Lucky Ji Hyo throws a 2.)

842
00:30:27,307 --> 00:30:29,307
This is all luck.

843
00:30:29,347 --> 00:30:30,777
- It's 5. - It's great.

844
00:30:30,777 --> 00:30:31,777
Throw a two.

845
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:33,707
- She threw a two! - What?

846
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,047
(The total score is 4.)

847
00:30:35,407 --> 00:30:37,877
- When I throw it, I'll get a five. - I know.

848
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,407
I'm sure I'll throw a five.

849
00:30:39,407 --> 00:30:41,507
Look at this. It will be a five.

850
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:44,047
(If Jong Kook throws a 5, the game is over.)

851
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:47,807
(Will he be able...)

852
00:30:47,807 --> 00:30:51,047
(to throw a 5 as he predicted?)

853
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:55,047
- Yes! - Did you see that?

854
00:30:55,047 --> 00:30:56,807
(He really threw a 5!)

855
00:30:57,077 --> 00:30:58,247
- Yes! - Did you see that?

856
00:30:58,247 --> 00:30:59,777
- I can't believe it. - It really happened.

857
00:30:59,777 --> 00:31:01,347
(Team White gets the meal as they score 10 points.)

858
00:31:01,347 --> 00:31:02,347
- It really happened. - No way.

859
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,947
- Haha, can this be possible? - I told you so.

860
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:05,947
Seriously?

861
00:31:07,107 --> 00:31:08,947
Can I sit in front of the soup?

862
00:31:08,947 --> 00:31:10,347
- Yes, please. - I'll sit here. You can sit there.

863
00:31:10,347 --> 00:31:12,607
- Okay. Let's sit and eat. - Goodness, look at this.

864
00:31:12,607 --> 00:31:14,077
Let us enjoy our meal.

865
00:31:14,077 --> 00:31:16,347
(Should we, Team White, enjoy the victors' meal by ourselves?)

866
00:31:16,347 --> 00:31:19,177
Goodness, we have some leftover duck.

867
00:31:20,077 --> 00:31:23,777
(Since he feels sad to enjoy this amazing meal alone...)

868
00:31:23,777 --> 00:31:25,477
Kwang Soo, you know that...

869
00:31:25,707 --> 00:31:28,647
duck dishes are healthy summer food...

870
00:31:28,677 --> 00:31:29,877
that energize us, right?

871
00:31:30,047 --> 00:31:32,677
These dishes have unsaturated fat.

872
00:31:32,677 --> 00:31:34,007
- It's good for people on a diet. - That's right.

873
00:31:34,007 --> 00:31:35,077
Those are healthy fats.

874
00:31:35,077 --> 00:31:36,707
- Ducks are great for our bodies. - It's really healthy.

875
00:31:36,847 --> 00:31:39,577
Ducks are full of protein,

876
00:31:39,577 --> 00:31:42,077
but what's more is that this fat is healthy.

877
00:31:42,077 --> 00:31:44,177
Even the skin tastes awesome.

878
00:31:44,207 --> 00:31:45,777
The skin is the tastiest.

879
00:31:45,777 --> 00:31:47,047
Goodness.

880
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:49,977
I want to give this wrap to someone.

881
00:31:51,507 --> 00:31:53,507
I want to give this wrap to someone.

882
00:31:53,507 --> 00:31:54,507
Me.

883
00:31:54,977 --> 00:31:55,977
(Give it to me.)

884
00:31:56,107 --> 00:31:57,107
Me.

885
00:31:57,777 --> 00:31:59,047
- It's refreshing. - So Min.

886
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:00,507
(I can't just give it to you.)

887
00:32:00,507 --> 00:32:02,307
Show us your skills with the magnet.

888
00:32:03,077 --> 00:32:04,707
Can the lid of the rice bowl stick on your face?

889
00:32:04,707 --> 00:32:05,707
- This one? - Yes.

890
00:32:05,907 --> 00:32:07,447
- If you can do, I'll give you this. - I haven't done it with this.

891
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:08,847
If I can do this, will you really give it to me?

892
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:10,407
(She hasn't put the lid of the rice bowl on her face,)

893
00:32:10,407 --> 00:32:16,007
(but since I'm the magnet, everything sticks onto my body.)

894
00:32:18,307 --> 00:32:20,207
(Let me see.)

895
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:22,947
(It sticks.)

896
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:25,207
Stay as you are. I'll feed it to you.

897
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:27,207
- No way. - Gosh.

898
00:32:27,207 --> 00:32:28,247
(It's the skill of the magnet.)

899
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:29,247
Let me have one too.

900
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,107
- I did it too. - You are amazing.

901
00:32:32,307 --> 00:32:34,307
- Give me a wrap too. - Kwang Soo, you are late.

902
00:32:34,307 --> 00:32:36,247
(Kwang Soo becomes the magnet too.)

903
00:32:36,777 --> 00:32:38,477
(When people are desperate, things go their way.)

904
00:32:38,477 --> 00:32:40,477
Please. Let me do this once.

905
00:32:41,507 --> 00:32:43,307
(It's a miracle!)

906
00:32:43,607 --> 00:32:45,507
- Give me a wrap too. - Kwang Soo, you are late.

907
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:46,507
- I did it too! - Please.

908
00:32:46,607 --> 00:32:47,607
Give me the meat too!

909
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,447
I did it too.

910
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:51,077
I can do this too. It worked.

911
00:32:51,147 --> 00:32:52,207
Kwang Soo, you were late.

912
00:32:52,207 --> 00:32:53,347
(Show us something else.)

913
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:55,307
- Kwang Soo, do something else. - Kwang Soo.

914
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:57,577
Please give me a chance.

915
00:32:57,907 --> 00:32:59,407
- Hey, this is... - Please give me a chance.

916
00:32:59,407 --> 00:33:00,677
(He shows his greatest skill.)

917
00:33:00,677 --> 00:33:01,877
- If that works, I'll give you one. - Please.

918
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:03,907
I did it. I can do this too.

919
00:33:04,747 --> 00:33:05,777
Let me have just one wrap, please.

920
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:07,647
- Please. - Kwang Soo.

921
00:33:08,307 --> 00:33:09,577
(He gives advice.)

922
00:33:09,577 --> 00:33:12,047
I can give you food if you stick the dried laver on your teeth.

923
00:33:12,507 --> 00:33:14,007
- If you do it, we'll give you food. - But...

924
00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:16,607
whoever puts the dried laver on their sideburns is the worst.

925
00:33:16,607 --> 00:33:17,607
I won't give that person the food.

926
00:33:20,507 --> 00:33:22,677
(He's the worst.)

927
00:33:25,347 --> 00:33:27,807
What is it? He put it on his sideburns?

928
00:33:27,807 --> 00:33:29,507
(I didn't know you were doing that.)

929
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,577
You can't do that.

930
00:33:30,577 --> 00:33:31,977
What do I have to do next?

931
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:34,107
(How do I look? He distinguishes himself from others.)

932
00:33:35,407 --> 00:33:36,507
(Impersonate a dummy)

933
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:38,307
(If you do well, I'll think about it.)

934
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,107
Say, "Kwang Soo isn't here."

935
00:33:40,107 --> 00:33:41,377
You have to do exactly he did.

936
00:33:43,477 --> 00:33:44,507
I'm starting to have second thoughts.

937
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:46,477
Why are you having second thoughts?

938
00:33:46,477 --> 00:33:47,977
Hey, I even put it here.

939
00:33:47,977 --> 00:33:49,007
- That's great. - Hey, just do it.

940
00:33:49,007 --> 00:33:50,007
- Great. - Nice.

941
00:33:50,007 --> 00:33:51,147
(She shows off her skills.)

942
00:33:51,147 --> 00:33:52,177
(Floundering)

943
00:33:52,177 --> 00:33:53,707
Hey, stop it.

944
00:33:54,147 --> 00:33:56,347
Hey, stop it. That's enough!

945
00:33:56,347 --> 00:34:01,877
(Why are you doing that? Just ask them to give you food!)

946
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:03,307
Stop it.

947
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:06,777
(Do you not have self-respect? It's only duck.)

948
00:34:08,407 --> 00:34:09,777
(Impersonating a dummy)

949
00:34:09,777 --> 00:34:11,017
Kwang Soo isn't here.

950
00:34:13,947 --> 00:34:16,677
(He doesn't have even the slightest self-respect.)

951
00:34:17,607 --> 00:34:20,577
(He swaps his self-respect for a piece of duck.)

952
00:34:20,577 --> 00:34:21,707
Kwang Soo succeeded.

953
00:34:23,677 --> 00:34:25,577
(Delicious)

954
00:34:26,347 --> 00:34:29,107
The myeongyi wrap is really good. It's the tastiest.

955
00:34:29,107 --> 00:34:30,807
- It's really tasty. - By the way,

956
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:34,747
don't put the dried laver under your eyes like the baseball players.

957
00:34:37,247 --> 00:34:39,107
(Sighing)

958
00:34:40,207 --> 00:34:42,977
Hey, Se Chan, stop being so mean. Haha is older than you.

959
00:34:43,477 --> 00:34:45,307
- Let's eat. - He's a father of two children.

960
00:34:46,047 --> 00:34:47,307
Do you think he wants to do that?

961
00:34:47,777 --> 00:34:48,777
I'm sorry.

962
00:34:48,777 --> 00:34:50,307
(I'm a respected father at home.)

963
00:34:51,207 --> 00:34:52,777
- Did we eat it all? - Hey, then...

964
00:34:52,907 --> 00:34:54,407
- If you think... - His son watches Running Man now.

965
00:34:54,407 --> 00:34:56,877
How can we work if we think about those things?

966
00:34:57,107 --> 00:34:59,877
We ought to do our job when we are at work.

967
00:34:59,877 --> 00:35:01,177
(I have to eat that duck.)

968
00:35:02,877 --> 00:35:04,707
(He becomes G-Dragon.)

969
00:35:05,447 --> 00:35:07,347
Wow, fantastic baby

970
00:35:07,347 --> 00:35:10,907
That's great. Haha, I like that.

971
00:35:10,907 --> 00:35:12,207
(Satisfied)

972
00:35:13,347 --> 00:35:16,207
(G-Dragon, are you watching?)

973
00:35:16,777 --> 00:35:18,077
- I'm Mamamoo. - You didn't like it?

974
00:35:18,077 --> 00:35:19,307
Give me a wrap.

975
00:35:19,307 --> 00:35:21,247
(I even danced for you.)

976
00:35:21,247 --> 00:35:22,347
If he can't eat it even after this...

977
00:35:22,347 --> 00:35:23,877
(Poor Dad)

978
00:35:23,877 --> 00:35:25,307
(Son, it's hard to make a living.)

979
00:35:25,307 --> 00:35:26,677
I even danced twice.

980
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:31,047
- You are too cruel. - Others have to agree.

981
00:35:31,047 --> 00:35:32,877
- Before you danced, - No way.

982
00:35:32,877 --> 00:35:34,407
what Kwang Soo did left a stronger impression.

983
00:35:34,707 --> 00:35:38,907
- You can sing for us too. - That's right.

984
00:35:41,577 --> 00:35:43,907
(My heart is reminded of you)

985
00:35:44,207 --> 00:35:48,577
(My heart is reminded of the duck.)

986
00:35:48,577 --> 00:35:49,707
That was pretty funny.

987
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:51,547
That's right. Give me a bite.

988
00:35:51,547 --> 00:35:52,677
I liked it.

989
00:35:54,017 --> 00:35:56,307
Here is a duck leg.

990
00:35:57,017 --> 00:35:58,077
Here you go.

991
00:35:59,177 --> 00:36:00,347
Enjoy.

992
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:04,047
Why are you eating it?

993
00:36:05,407 --> 00:36:06,647
So Min, wait a minute.

994
00:36:06,647 --> 00:36:07,847
She is crazy.

995
00:36:07,847 --> 00:36:09,447
Why are you eating it?

996
00:36:09,777 --> 00:36:11,207
(Justice wins.)

997
00:36:12,947 --> 00:36:14,047
Why are you eating it?

998
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:20,347
(He confiscates the duck.)

999
00:36:20,547 --> 00:36:21,877
That was incredible.

1000
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:24,207
She had it past her molars.

1001
00:36:24,477 --> 00:36:26,517
How did you take out food past her molars?

1002
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,577
That was incredible.

1003
00:36:27,577 --> 00:36:31,807
(He studies the opponent and puts the food in his mouth.)

1004
00:36:31,807 --> 00:36:34,047
His fingers came down to my uvula.

1005
00:36:34,047 --> 00:36:37,707
(His fingers came down to my uvula.)

1006
00:36:38,677 --> 00:36:40,307
I thought I had missed something.

1007
00:36:40,307 --> 00:36:41,677
Was that your uvula?

1008
00:36:42,907 --> 00:36:44,447
I thought it was meat.

1009
00:36:45,047 --> 00:36:46,777
I pulled it because I thought it was meat.

1010
00:36:46,777 --> 00:36:48,047
(They now move for the next mission.)

1011
00:36:49,517 --> 00:36:51,777
(This mission will chase away the heat.)

1012
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:52,777
What is that?

1013
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,077
What is that?

1014
00:36:54,077 --> 00:36:55,877
- What is that? - Will they make us dive?

1015
00:36:55,877 --> 00:36:56,977
(What is that?)

1016
00:36:58,307 --> 00:37:01,607
(There are tall diving platforms...)

1017
00:37:01,607 --> 00:37:05,647
(and frightening flying chairs.)

1018
00:37:05,647 --> 00:37:06,777
(The oasis of celebrities in variety shows)

1019
00:37:06,777 --> 00:37:08,247
- Aren't those flying chairs? - Those are flying chairs.

1020
00:37:08,407 --> 00:37:09,807
My goodness.

1021
00:37:10,747 --> 00:37:13,147
The season of flying chairs has begun.

1022
00:37:13,277 --> 00:37:15,747
- I haven't used it before. - This is a disaster.

1023
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:17,477
- Haven't you used it before? - No, this will be my first time.

1024
00:37:17,707 --> 00:37:19,107
(Fascinated)

1025
00:37:19,107 --> 00:37:20,647
I have used it recently.

1026
00:37:21,047 --> 00:37:22,107
What?

1027
00:37:22,647 --> 00:37:24,407
So Min!

1028
00:37:25,207 --> 00:37:26,277
It's a frog.

1029
00:37:26,747 --> 00:37:29,677
(It's good to see you, my friend.)

1030
00:37:30,777 --> 00:37:32,047
Why is the pool so deep?

1031
00:37:32,047 --> 00:37:33,247
It's nice.

1032
00:37:33,707 --> 00:37:37,377
(She doesn't pay attention to the flying chairs.)

1033
00:37:37,377 --> 00:37:40,077
(She is cheerful.)

1034
00:37:40,307 --> 00:37:42,277
Please stand in the center.

1035
00:37:42,277 --> 00:37:44,517
- Okay. - I hate this.

1036
00:37:44,747 --> 00:37:46,347
- For goodness' sake. - This is fascinating.

1037
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,407
(It makes me realize that I joined Running Man.)

1038
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,107
This mission is...

1039
00:37:49,107 --> 00:37:51,517
Jukebox Go Stop.

1040
00:37:51,607 --> 00:37:52,777
What is that?

1041
00:37:53,847 --> 00:37:56,047
Listen to the song that is playing on the jukebox.

1042
00:37:56,047 --> 00:37:59,547
If you know the title, come out to the front and say it.

1043
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,677
If your answer is wrong, wind will blow on your face...

1044
00:38:01,677 --> 00:38:03,517
and a chance to answer will be given to the next person.

1045
00:38:03,517 --> 00:38:05,077
While the person who got the title right sings the song,

1046
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:08,207
other members will quickly sit on the flying chairs.

1047
00:38:08,307 --> 00:38:10,977
Then they will hold a beach ball and play rock, paper, scissors.

1048
00:38:11,447 --> 00:38:14,877
The beach ball can be passed down only if they play the same hand.

1049
00:38:15,017 --> 00:38:16,747
When the person who was singing...

1050
00:38:16,747 --> 00:38:18,777
yells "Stop" and raises the flag,

1051
00:38:18,777 --> 00:38:21,847
the person with the ball will fly backwards.

1052
00:38:22,077 --> 00:38:23,777
(When the person who was singing yells "Stop",)

1053
00:38:23,777 --> 00:38:27,517
(the person with the ball will fly backwards.)

1054
00:38:27,517 --> 00:38:29,647
If you sing for a long time, the ball will continue to move.

1055
00:38:29,647 --> 00:38:31,707
That's right. You can sing for a long time.

1056
00:38:31,707 --> 00:38:34,307
The winning team will get a chance to change a team member.

1057
00:38:34,947 --> 00:38:37,807
(The winning team will get a chance to change a team member.)

1058
00:38:37,877 --> 00:38:41,207
The first problem is a K-Pop song from the past.

1059
00:38:41,207 --> 00:38:43,077
- That's great. - A K-Pop song from the past.

1060
00:38:43,077 --> 00:38:44,777
The first problem is a K-Pop song from the past.

1061
00:38:44,777 --> 00:38:46,347
- That's great. - A K-Pop song from the past.

1062
00:38:46,347 --> 00:38:48,347
- That's great. - I love K-Pop songs from the past.

1063
00:38:48,347 --> 00:38:49,577
I love K-Pop songs from the past.

1064
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,647
(We can't win against those middle-aged men.)

1065
00:38:51,647 --> 00:38:53,647
The first problem, a K-Pop song from the past.

1066
00:38:53,777 --> 00:38:55,347
Music, please.

1067
00:38:55,347 --> 00:38:57,247
(The music begins to play.)

1068
00:38:57,647 --> 00:38:58,647
This is...

1069
00:39:00,147 --> 00:39:01,247
This is...

1070
00:39:01,947 --> 00:39:04,447
(What is this strange intro?)

1071
00:39:04,447 --> 00:39:05,577
Is it by Chakra?

1072
00:39:06,047 --> 00:39:07,707
(Moving)

1073
00:39:07,707 --> 00:39:08,877
- Do you know this song? - I have the answer.

1074
00:39:08,877 --> 00:39:10,277
(He slowly moves as if something is pulling him.)

1075
00:39:10,277 --> 00:39:11,517
- Do you know this song? - I have the answer.

1076
00:39:12,047 --> 00:39:13,207
(You are younger than me.)

1077
00:39:14,647 --> 00:39:18,977
(Is Se Chan unexpectedly well-versed in old songs?)

1078
00:39:18,977 --> 00:39:21,777
- Tell us the answer. - Between the sky and the earth

1079
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,977
(Confident)

1080
00:39:23,977 --> 00:39:25,407
-You need to tell us the artist... - The artist?

1081
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:27,077
and the title of the song.

1082
00:39:27,077 --> 00:39:28,877
- Was there a rule like that? - I told you earlier.

1083
00:39:30,047 --> 00:39:31,177
That's right.

1084
00:39:31,247 --> 00:39:33,177
(Jae Seok figures out the answer.)

1085
00:39:33,177 --> 00:39:34,207
Was there a rule like that?

1086
00:39:34,207 --> 00:39:35,277
Ahn Seong Il?

1087
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,877
I have the answer.

1088
00:39:38,907 --> 00:39:41,577
Dosi Brothers.

1089
00:39:41,577 --> 00:39:43,147
(Confident)

1090
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:44,577
"The Fairy and the Woodcutter".

1091
00:39:45,147 --> 00:39:49,017
(Is the answer Dosi Brother's "The Fairy and the Woodcutter"?)

1092
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:52,907
(The answer is "The Fairy and the Woodcutter"...)

1093
00:39:52,907 --> 00:39:57,247
(by the former member of Dosi Brothers, Kim Chang Nam.)

1094
00:39:58,207 --> 00:39:59,947
Dosi Brothers.

1095
00:39:59,947 --> 00:40:01,517
(He didn't get the artist right.)

1096
00:40:01,517 --> 00:40:02,677
"The Fairy and the Woodcutter".

1097
00:40:02,677 --> 00:40:04,147
- "The Fairy and the Woodcutter". - I have the answer.

1098
00:40:04,677 --> 00:40:07,447
- It's right. - I have the answer.

1099
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:08,747
(He gets a gust of wind in Jae Seok's place.)

1100
00:40:08,747 --> 00:40:10,707
Dosi Brothers' "The Woodcutter and the Fairy".

1101
00:40:10,877 --> 00:40:12,477
(Incorrect)

1102
00:40:12,807 --> 00:40:14,107
It's "The Fairy and the Woodcutter".

1103
00:40:14,447 --> 00:40:15,517
I have the answer.

1104
00:40:16,017 --> 00:40:17,147
The Fairy and the Kids'...

1105
00:40:17,477 --> 00:40:19,107
"The Woodcutter, You, and Me".

1106
00:40:19,107 --> 00:40:21,307
("The Woodcutter, You, and Me")

1107
00:40:22,077 --> 00:40:23,177
What was that?

1108
00:40:23,177 --> 00:40:25,847
(The title is too sentimental for a woodcutter.)

1109
00:40:26,447 --> 00:40:27,577
Dosi Brothers.

1110
00:40:27,677 --> 00:40:29,207
"The Fairy and the Woodcutter".

1111
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:31,147
- And? - "The Fairy and the Woodcutter".

1112
00:40:31,247 --> 00:40:32,807
"The Fairy's Woodcutter".

1113
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:34,647
Dosi Brothers.

1114
00:40:34,747 --> 00:40:36,177
It's "The Fairy and the Woodcutter".

1115
00:40:36,177 --> 00:40:37,517
It's "The Fairy and the Woodcutter".

1116
00:40:37,517 --> 00:40:39,307
"The Fairy and the Woodcutter" is correct.

1117
00:40:39,677 --> 00:40:42,017
A member of Dosi Brothers...

1118
00:40:42,017 --> 00:40:43,377
(The producer gives them a hint.)

1119
00:40:43,377 --> 00:40:45,017
- It must be a solo song. - I have the answer.

1120
00:40:45,017 --> 00:40:46,517
(It looks like he will get it right.)

1121
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,847
Kim Chang Nam and Dosi Brothers.

1122
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:50,277
I have the answer.

1123
00:40:50,677 --> 00:40:52,877
Kim Chang Nam's "The Fairy and the Woodcutter".

1124
00:40:53,607 --> 00:40:57,607
(Seok Jin's answer is correct.)

1125
00:41:01,107 --> 00:41:03,247
- Our team got it right. - Sit down.

1126
00:41:03,407 --> 00:41:04,577
Do we need to sit down?

1127
00:41:04,577 --> 00:41:05,947
- Sit down. - Do we need to sit down, too?

1128
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:07,477
We need to sit down as well.

1129
00:41:07,477 --> 00:41:09,847
(What will become of Pass the Bomb?)

1130
00:41:10,307 --> 00:41:11,517
Fools.

1131
00:41:11,517 --> 00:41:12,747
I won't get thrown into the pool.

1132
00:41:12,747 --> 00:41:13,877
How do we play?

1133
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,747
(Dancing)

1134
00:41:16,747 --> 00:41:18,377
Please enjoy it.

1135
00:41:18,747 --> 00:41:21,677
(They begin to pass the bomb.)

1136
00:41:21,777 --> 00:41:23,247
Rock, paper, scissors.

1137
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:26,807
(The ball can be passed down if they play the same hand.)

1138
00:41:27,177 --> 00:41:29,277
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Your teammates are at the end.

1139
00:41:29,847 --> 00:41:33,777
(He doesn't hear anything.)

1140
00:41:33,847 --> 00:41:35,377
Rock, paper, scissors. Rock, paper, scissors.

1141
00:41:35,377 --> 00:41:37,107
(They begin to feel nervous.)

1142
00:41:37,107 --> 00:41:38,177
Rock, paper, scissors.

1143
00:41:38,177 --> 00:41:40,477
You have five seconds left.

1144
00:41:40,477 --> 00:41:42,977
(He announces he will yell "Stop" 5 seconds later.)

1145
00:41:42,977 --> 00:41:45,347
(They rush their movements in nervousness.)

1146
00:41:46,177 --> 00:41:48,707
(When Seok Jin yells "Stop",)

1147
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:52,177
(someone will get plunged into the pool.)

1148
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:55,147
(Who will be the first member?)

1149
00:41:55,147 --> 00:41:56,477
Rock, paper, scissors. Rock, paper, scissors.

1150
00:41:57,477 --> 00:41:58,607
Five.

1151
00:41:59,177 --> 00:42:00,307
- Five. - Rock, paper, scissors.

1152
00:42:00,307 --> 00:42:04,247
4, 3.

1153
00:42:04,247 --> 00:42:06,647
(The countdown makes Team Black flustered.)

1154
00:42:06,647 --> 00:42:07,707
Two.

1155
00:42:07,707 --> 00:42:09,447
(The countdown has 2 seconds left to go.)

1156
00:42:09,447 --> 00:42:10,447
One.

1157
00:42:11,177 --> 00:42:13,647
(Who will be holding the bomb?)

1158
00:42:14,277 --> 00:42:16,477
(They tied with 1 second remaining.)

1159
00:42:16,477 --> 00:42:17,577
One.

1160
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:18,647
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Stop.

1161
00:42:18,647 --> 00:42:20,347
(Stop.)

1162
00:42:20,647 --> 00:42:22,707
Haha. In 1, 2...

1163
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,277
In 1, 2, 3.

1164
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:30,807
It's too intense.

1165
00:42:31,707 --> 00:42:33,947
(Shocked and scared)

1166
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:36,547
Haha. In 1, 2, 3.

1167
00:42:36,777 --> 00:42:39,677
(The upgraded flying chair of 2017)

1168
00:42:41,677 --> 00:42:46,847
(The height, degree, and comfort of the flight are the best.)

1169
00:42:48,807 --> 00:42:50,207
It's too intense.

1170
00:42:50,207 --> 00:42:52,277
(The first customer is satisfied.)

1171
00:42:52,807 --> 00:42:54,177
It's too intense.

1172
00:42:54,177 --> 00:42:55,177
(This is no joke.)

1173
00:42:55,177 --> 00:42:56,677
He flew so high.

1174
00:42:57,017 --> 00:42:58,517
He flew very high.

1175
00:42:58,517 --> 00:43:00,847
It's not dangerous since the water is deep.

1176
00:43:02,977 --> 00:43:05,077
- That was intense. - It will be the end of you.

1177
00:43:05,077 --> 00:43:06,807
(The customer's review)

1178
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,707
All right.

1179
00:43:08,777 --> 00:43:09,847
That was incredible.

1180
00:43:10,447 --> 00:43:12,047
I had a lot of thoughts up there.

1181
00:43:12,607 --> 00:43:13,707
It took forever to come down.

1182
00:43:13,877 --> 00:43:15,647
This problem...

1183
00:43:16,017 --> 00:43:17,577
is an OST of the past.

1184
00:43:17,577 --> 00:43:18,847
We have an advantage.

1185
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:20,647
That's my specialty. I know a lot of OSTs.

1186
00:43:20,647 --> 00:43:23,177
Kwang Soo, Ji Hyo, and So Min would know a lot too.

1187
00:43:23,177 --> 00:43:24,807
You don't need to get the artist this time.

1188
00:43:24,807 --> 00:43:26,207
Name which drama or movie it was in.

1189
00:43:26,207 --> 00:43:27,807
I don't know the OSTs for movies.

1190
00:43:28,517 --> 00:43:30,907
I need to beat the person next to me to pass down the ball.

1191
00:43:30,907 --> 00:43:33,047
That's right. You need to beat the person.

1192
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:35,677
Music, please.

1193
00:43:35,677 --> 00:43:37,077
(The music for the second problem begins to play.)

1194
00:43:38,277 --> 00:43:39,377
- I have the answer. - I have the answer.

1195
00:43:39,377 --> 00:43:41,377
(Everyone knows the answer.)

1196
00:43:41,377 --> 00:43:42,777
- I have the answer. - I have the answer.

1197
00:43:42,777 --> 00:43:44,307
- I have the answer. - I have the answer.

1198
00:43:44,307 --> 00:43:45,377
- Se Chan. - He grabbed the microphone.

1199
00:43:45,377 --> 00:43:47,377
Get in the line. Se Chan will answer first.

1200
00:43:47,377 --> 00:43:48,877
- This is... - Get in the line.

1201
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:49,977
Get in the line.

1202
00:43:50,107 --> 00:43:52,007
The answer is "Piano".

1203
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:53,247
- That's it. - It's incorrect.

1204
00:43:53,247 --> 00:43:54,277
- It's correct. - It's correct.

1205
00:43:54,277 --> 00:43:55,407
- It's correct. - It's "Piano".

1206
00:43:55,407 --> 00:43:56,847
The answer is "Piano".

1207
00:43:56,847 --> 00:43:57,977
I am sure it's correct.

1208
00:43:57,977 --> 00:43:59,807
- It's the correct answer. - The answer is "Piano".

1209
00:43:59,807 --> 00:44:00,877
"Piano".

1210
00:44:00,877 --> 00:44:02,077
Don't we need to name the artist?

1211
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:05,907
("Piano" is an SBS drama...)

1212
00:44:05,907 --> 00:44:08,847
(that had a viewer rating of 40 percent.)

1213
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:12,877
(The drama made stars like Go Soo, Zo In Sung, and Kim Ha Neul.)

1214
00:44:16,407 --> 00:44:17,747
Let's try not to receive the penalty.

1215
00:44:18,407 --> 00:44:20,477
- Let's do a good job. - We didn't answer the problem.

1216
00:44:20,477 --> 00:44:23,007
We can do this.

1217
00:44:23,647 --> 00:44:26,277
(Everyone is scared.)

1218
00:44:26,547 --> 00:44:28,877
I will enjoy singing. Let's get it on. Okay.

1219
00:44:29,507 --> 00:44:30,577
Let's go.

1220
00:44:30,577 --> 00:44:32,477
(He is in good cheer.)

1221
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:35,407
(The members in the back play rock, paper, scissors of death.)

1222
00:44:35,677 --> 00:44:36,877
- Rock, paper, scissors. - This is great.

1223
00:44:36,877 --> 00:44:38,307
I bet he will stop after the first verse.

1224
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:43,177
(Se Chan begins to sing.)

1225
00:44:45,207 --> 00:44:47,777
(Absorbed)

1226
00:44:48,907 --> 00:44:50,147
He is good.

1227
00:44:50,777 --> 00:44:51,807
He is good.

1228
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:55,277
(Se Chan has no intention of yelling "Stop".)

1229
00:44:56,077 --> 00:44:57,277
He is good.

1230
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,347
(They waste time.)

1231
00:44:59,347 --> 00:45:01,847
(Hurry up and pass the ball.)

1232
00:45:02,447 --> 00:45:05,307
(Taking their time)

1233
00:45:06,447 --> 00:45:08,107
(Slow)

1234
00:45:09,847 --> 00:45:13,007
(The sadness brings tears to my eyes)

1235
00:45:13,007 --> 00:45:14,077
Here I go.

1236
00:45:14,077 --> 00:45:17,707
(They were taking time, but their bodies react to "Here I go".)

1237
00:45:17,707 --> 00:45:20,447
(Don't call me a coward)

1238
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:24,577
(I love Se Chan.)

1239
00:45:25,377 --> 00:45:27,677
(Towards the end of the chorus,)

1240
00:45:27,677 --> 00:45:30,507
(they begin to worry.)

1241
00:45:31,407 --> 00:45:32,777
(Hurried)

1242
00:45:33,447 --> 00:45:36,477
(They are nervous as if it's a real bomb.)

1243
00:45:36,807 --> 00:45:39,677
(Please let me win.)

1244
00:45:40,907 --> 00:45:43,247
(The bomb is close to exploding.)

1245
00:45:44,307 --> 00:45:45,847
He is good.

1246
00:45:45,847 --> 00:45:46,907
(It's a fight with time.)

1247
00:45:46,907 --> 00:45:49,047
(The sky... Here I go.)

1248
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,877
(Se Chan shouts, "Here I go.")

1249
00:45:50,877 --> 00:45:53,277
(Jae Seok still has the ball.)

1250
00:45:53,277 --> 00:45:54,647
(The moment you look away)

1251
00:45:54,647 --> 00:45:56,207
Stop!

1252
00:45:56,977 --> 00:45:59,377
(He yells stop.)

1253
00:45:59,377 --> 00:46:01,747
(Who has the ball?)

1254
00:46:02,847 --> 00:46:05,847
(They both stop.)

1255
00:46:06,107 --> 00:46:08,877
(Haha gets selected for two consecutive times.)

1256
00:46:08,877 --> 00:46:10,307
It's Haha.

1257
00:46:10,307 --> 00:46:12,647
In 1, 2, 3.

1258
00:46:13,077 --> 00:46:15,447
(Welcome, customer.)

1259
00:46:16,477 --> 00:46:18,777
(This is the standard posture for the flying chair.)

1260
00:46:20,047 --> 00:46:21,307
(With eyes open wide,)

1261
00:46:21,307 --> 00:46:23,747
(he flaps his feeble arms.)

1262
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:26,747
(This is the standard way to fall in the water.)

1263
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:32,207
That was so close.

1264
00:46:32,207 --> 00:46:33,977
- It was so close. - Was it?

1265
00:46:34,777 --> 00:46:37,607
- I almost got thrown in. - He yelled stop as you passed it.

1266
00:46:37,747 --> 00:46:39,547
That was amazing.

1267
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,877
- I won many times. - It's scary.

1268
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:43,947
I defeated Jae Seok many times.

1269
00:46:43,947 --> 00:46:45,747
- He kept winning. - If I had won...

1270
00:46:45,747 --> 00:46:47,107
one more round.

1271
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,947
(He wins once.)

1272
00:46:48,947 --> 00:46:50,107
(Twice)

1273
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:51,207
(3 times)

1274
00:46:51,207 --> 00:46:53,547
(4 and 5 times)

1275
00:46:53,547 --> 00:46:56,707
(Se Chan yells stop after they play 5 rounds.)

1276
00:46:57,207 --> 00:47:00,277
- If I had won one more round... - That was close.

1277
00:47:00,277 --> 00:47:01,307
Next category is...

1278
00:47:02,177 --> 00:47:04,547
old Korean pop songs.

1279
00:47:04,547 --> 00:47:06,107
- This is great. - Old Korean pop songs.

1280
00:47:06,107 --> 00:47:07,947
- Old Korean pop songs? - Here we go.

1281
00:47:07,947 --> 00:47:10,647
Please play the music.

1282
00:47:11,077 --> 00:47:12,647
Why are you competing against me?

1283
00:47:14,077 --> 00:47:15,277
Deux.

1284
00:47:15,277 --> 00:47:16,277
Is it correct?

1285
00:47:16,847 --> 00:47:18,107
Isn't it correct?

1286
00:47:18,307 --> 00:47:19,477
Come back here.

1287
00:47:19,477 --> 00:47:20,677
May I answer it?

1288
00:47:20,677 --> 00:47:22,377
- Go ahead. - May I answer it?

1289
00:47:22,377 --> 00:47:23,407
Yes.

1290
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:26,907
(Will he answer correctly again after the first measure?)

1291
00:47:27,647 --> 00:47:29,147
It's "Two of Us" by Chae Yeon.

1292
00:47:29,907 --> 00:47:33,007
(Is he being arrogant or is he correct?)

1293
00:47:33,007 --> 00:47:34,047
What's the answer?

1294
00:47:34,047 --> 00:47:35,247
(He's incorrect.)

1295
00:47:36,007 --> 00:47:38,077
The answer is "I Don't Know" by Uhm Jung Hwa.

1296
00:47:38,477 --> 00:47:39,707
Uhm Jung Hwa?

1297
00:47:42,307 --> 00:47:43,847
Wait a minute.

1298
00:47:43,847 --> 00:47:45,947
- What are you doing? - "Festival" by Uhm Jung Hwa.

1299
00:47:46,347 --> 00:47:48,377
The answer is "Betrayal of the Rose" by Uhm Jung Hwa.

1300
00:47:48,747 --> 00:47:51,047
- That's wrong. - "I Don't Know" by Uhm Jung Hwa.

1301
00:47:51,507 --> 00:47:53,447
- That's wrong. - "Poison" by Uhm Jung Hwa.

1302
00:47:53,447 --> 00:47:55,577
The answer is "Betrayal of the Rose" by Uhm Jung Hwa.

1303
00:47:55,577 --> 00:47:57,047
It's not a song by Uhm Jung Hwa.

1304
00:47:57,047 --> 00:47:58,407
- Let's go again. - We were fooled.

1305
00:47:58,407 --> 00:47:59,777
Play music.

1306
00:48:02,207 --> 00:48:03,307
I know this song.

1307
00:48:03,307 --> 00:48:04,647
(It sounds familiar.)

1308
00:48:04,707 --> 00:48:05,847
I know the answer.

1309
00:48:06,147 --> 00:48:08,007
"You're So Sexy".

1310
00:48:08,977 --> 00:48:10,807
- I know the answer. - It's Korean pop.

1311
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:13,177
It's "Wa" by Lee Jung Hyun.

1312
00:48:13,177 --> 00:48:14,607
- That's wrong. - That's not it.

1313
00:48:14,607 --> 00:48:15,607
Come back.

1314
00:48:16,077 --> 00:48:17,847
- I know the answer. - That's the one.

1315
00:48:17,847 --> 00:48:19,607
- It's something else. - Doesn't it go like this?

1316
00:48:21,647 --> 00:48:23,507
It's by Chae Jung An.

1317
00:48:23,547 --> 00:48:25,277
- I was going to say that. - Chae Jung An's...

1318
00:48:25,377 --> 00:48:26,477
What is it?

1319
00:48:26,477 --> 00:48:27,677
(People start to wonder.)

1320
00:48:27,677 --> 00:48:30,207
It's Chae Jung An's...

1321
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:32,377
Come on, you know the song.

1322
00:48:32,477 --> 00:48:33,847
- It's Chae Jung An's... - Didn't it play yesterday?

1323
00:48:34,147 --> 00:48:35,207
I know the answer.

1324
00:48:36,007 --> 00:48:39,447
It's "Two of Us Alone" by Chae Jung An.

1325
00:48:41,007 --> 00:48:42,447
You sounded so cheesy.

1326
00:48:42,547 --> 00:48:43,707
Chae Jung An?

1327
00:48:44,307 --> 00:48:45,747
Isn't it correct?

1328
00:48:45,747 --> 00:48:47,477
Keep listening to the song.

1329
00:48:47,477 --> 00:48:48,477
I have no idea.

1330
00:48:48,477 --> 00:48:49,977
I thought it was Chae Jung An.

1331
00:48:50,707 --> 00:48:53,447
It's by Chae Jung An, but I don't remember the song title.

1332
00:48:54,307 --> 00:48:55,347
Gosh.

1333
00:48:55,347 --> 00:48:56,377
I know this.

1334
00:48:57,177 --> 00:48:58,777
- Gosh. - I know this.

1335
00:48:58,777 --> 00:49:01,047
The song goes like this.

1336
00:49:01,047 --> 00:49:02,077
You must know it.

1337
00:49:02,077 --> 00:49:03,107
It's by Chae Yeon.

1338
00:49:03,647 --> 00:49:05,507
- Chae Yeon? - Chae Yeon?

1339
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:06,847
(Isn't that right?)

1340
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:08,847
It's by Chae Yeon.

1341
00:49:09,307 --> 00:49:10,747
- That's wrong. - Isn't it by Chae Yeon?

1342
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:12,107
It's by Lee Jung Hyun.

1343
00:49:12,347 --> 00:49:15,307
I was attracted by your quivering look

1344
00:49:15,507 --> 00:49:17,647
Don't try to avoid me

1345
00:49:21,947 --> 00:49:23,247
It's called "Half".

1346
00:49:23,447 --> 00:49:24,477
That's correct.

1347
00:49:24,477 --> 00:49:27,477
(Jae Seok answers correctly.)

1348
00:49:27,477 --> 00:49:30,747
(He finally answers "Half" by Lee Jung Hyun.)

1349
00:49:30,747 --> 00:49:32,077
My goodness.

1350
00:49:32,077 --> 00:49:34,077
- We said all possible answers. - Goodness.

1351
00:49:35,047 --> 00:49:38,977
(Released in her 3rd album, it represents techno music.)

1352
00:49:38,977 --> 00:49:42,547
(Though it wasn't her main song, it swept all music charts.)

1353
00:49:43,377 --> 00:49:44,947
I almost didn't make it.

1354
00:49:45,747 --> 00:49:47,447
Please play the music.

1355
00:49:47,447 --> 00:49:48,977
("Half" by Lee Jung Hyun)

1356
00:49:51,307 --> 00:49:53,547
(I was attracted by your look)

1357
00:49:53,647 --> 00:49:55,577
Rock-paper-scissors.

1358
00:49:56,607 --> 00:49:58,607
(They're very serious.)

1359
00:49:59,377 --> 00:50:02,247
(Singing with his harsh voice, he dances along.)

1360
00:50:02,247 --> 00:50:04,277
Rock-paper-scissors.

1361
00:50:05,107 --> 00:50:06,877
Rock-paper-scissors.

1362
00:50:06,877 --> 00:50:11,547
(While everyone else is nervous, he finishes the first verse.)

1363
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:14,877
Rock-paper-scissors.

1364
00:50:14,877 --> 00:50:17,947
(If he yells stop, Jong Kook will be selected.)

1365
00:50:17,947 --> 00:50:19,647
(Please say stop.)

1366
00:50:23,677 --> 00:50:26,307
I'll sing a little more.

1367
00:50:26,307 --> 00:50:27,707
Rock-paper-scissors.

1368
00:50:27,947 --> 00:50:29,607
I'll sing a little more.

1369
00:50:29,707 --> 00:50:32,177
Shall I stop here or continue?

1370
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:34,447
(I want to continue, but shall I stop here?)

1371
00:50:35,077 --> 00:50:36,507
I'm wondering.

1372
00:50:36,507 --> 00:50:37,507
(It's nerve-racking.)

1373
00:50:37,507 --> 00:50:39,847
Goodness, what should I do?

1374
00:50:39,847 --> 00:50:40,847
(Don't come to me.)

1375
00:50:40,847 --> 00:50:42,977
Rock-paper-scissors.

1376
00:50:42,977 --> 00:50:44,207
(He keeps singing.)

1377
00:50:44,647 --> 00:50:46,207
Rock-paper-scissors.

1378
00:50:46,207 --> 00:50:48,107
Rock-paper-scissors.

1379
00:50:48,107 --> 00:50:50,247
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Don't insist upon me

1380
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:51,977
I only loved you

1381
00:50:51,977 --> 00:50:53,347
(It's coming up soon.)

1382
00:50:53,547 --> 00:50:55,507
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Come on.

1383
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:56,907
Rock-paper-scissors.

1384
00:50:56,907 --> 00:51:00,107
(He yells out stop.)

1385
00:51:00,107 --> 00:51:03,407
- Stop. - Wait a minute.

1386
00:51:03,777 --> 00:51:05,277
- Stop. - Wait.

1387
00:51:05,277 --> 00:51:07,007
- Stop. - I'll go after I take a breath.

1388
00:51:07,007 --> 00:51:08,647
- Is it So Min? - Yes.

1389
00:51:08,747 --> 00:51:10,977
- Did So Min get selected? - In 1, 2, 3.

1390
00:51:11,207 --> 00:51:13,807
(Welcome.)

1391
00:51:13,807 --> 00:51:16,547
(Is this your first time on the flying chair?)

1392
00:51:17,177 --> 00:51:19,977
(She falls forward as she dives.)

1393
00:51:20,207 --> 00:51:22,907
So Min, you fell on your face.

1394
00:51:22,947 --> 00:51:24,277
What happened?

1395
00:51:24,277 --> 00:51:25,977
Why did you fall on your face?

1396
00:51:25,977 --> 00:51:27,047
(Why did you fall forward?)

1397
00:51:27,047 --> 00:51:28,047
Are you okay?

1398
00:51:28,047 --> 00:51:29,607
I'm okay.

1399
00:51:29,747 --> 00:51:31,777
- I'm sorry. - I was so nervous.

1400
00:51:31,777 --> 00:51:34,507
I can't be on Running Man anymore.

1401
00:51:35,877 --> 00:51:37,447
It's okay, So Min.

1402
00:51:37,847 --> 00:51:40,247
Mom, take out the deposit on the house.

1403
00:51:40,407 --> 00:51:42,547
- No. - If you want to...

1404
00:51:42,547 --> 00:51:44,107
buy a house,

1405
00:51:44,207 --> 00:51:45,747
you have to work more.

1406
00:51:45,847 --> 00:51:47,907
- If you want to buy a house, - Go in the water once more.

1407
00:51:47,907 --> 00:51:50,407
you have to fall in the water more.

1408
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:52,147
It's only for today.

1409
00:51:52,147 --> 00:51:55,007
Mom, I'm sorry. I'll buy you delicious food instead.

1410
00:51:55,707 --> 00:51:57,577
So Min, you have to persevere.

1411
00:51:58,777 --> 00:52:02,907
The next category is old Korean pop songs again.

1412
00:52:03,177 --> 00:52:04,947
Let's try to win.

1413
00:52:04,947 --> 00:52:07,707
(Team White wins if they win one more round.)

1414
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:11,307
(Will Team Black turn the tables?)

1415
00:52:11,307 --> 00:52:13,277
Play music.

1416
00:52:14,707 --> 00:52:16,877
It's the sound of a boat horn.

1417
00:52:16,877 --> 00:52:18,147
I want to sing at least once.

1418
00:52:22,377 --> 00:52:24,947
I don't know the song.

1419
00:52:25,077 --> 00:52:26,547
- I have no idea. - Me neither.

1420
00:52:26,547 --> 00:52:29,247
All techno songs from early 2000s start like this.

1421
00:52:29,247 --> 00:52:30,447
What's the answer?

1422
00:52:31,377 --> 00:52:33,447
Is it "999"?

1423
00:52:33,447 --> 00:52:34,707
("Galaxy Express 999")

1424
00:52:34,807 --> 00:52:36,607
- What did you say? - "999".

1425
00:52:36,607 --> 00:52:38,507
It's "Genuine" by Koyote.

1426
00:52:38,547 --> 00:52:40,547
- That's wrong. - We should listen farther.

1427
00:52:40,547 --> 00:52:42,277
- We do. - Play music.

1428
00:52:44,707 --> 00:52:46,007
I know this song.

1429
00:52:46,007 --> 00:52:47,107
They all start like this.

1430
00:52:47,107 --> 00:52:48,177
Right.

1431
00:52:48,647 --> 00:52:49,707
(Hesitant)

1432
00:52:49,707 --> 00:52:51,347
- What is it? - You lost your chance.

1433
00:52:51,347 --> 00:52:52,377
(He seems to recognize it.)

1434
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,747
That's right.

1435
00:52:55,207 --> 00:52:56,807
I don't remember the song title.

1436
00:52:56,807 --> 00:52:58,107
Who knows the answer?

1437
00:52:58,147 --> 00:52:59,247
I know.

1438
00:52:59,277 --> 00:53:01,447
(Seok Jin knows many old Korean pop songs.)

1439
00:53:01,447 --> 00:53:04,247
(If he answers correctly, Team Black will be defeated.)

1440
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:05,277
I know the answer.

1441
00:53:05,277 --> 00:53:07,307
It's "Seoul" by Lee Yong.

1442
00:53:07,307 --> 00:53:08,747
(Incorrect)

1443
00:53:09,007 --> 00:53:10,947
What are you talking about?

1444
00:53:10,947 --> 00:53:11,947
Seok Jin.

1445
00:53:11,947 --> 00:53:13,607
Will you keep losing our chance?

1446
00:53:14,207 --> 00:53:15,507
What you're doing is pointless.

1447
00:53:15,507 --> 00:53:17,177
Will you keep saying nonsense?

1448
00:53:17,177 --> 00:53:19,407
How could he say Lee Yong?

1449
00:53:19,407 --> 00:53:21,077
Continue playing music.

1450
00:53:23,747 --> 00:53:25,247
I know this song.

1451
00:53:25,947 --> 00:53:27,747
What you want is

1452
00:53:27,747 --> 00:53:30,347
It's a song by Chae Jung An.

1453
00:53:30,347 --> 00:53:31,747
Are you serious?

1454
00:53:31,747 --> 00:53:33,307
You must love her song,

1455
00:53:33,477 --> 00:53:35,507
- but it's not her song. - I'm sure it's Chae Jung An.

1456
00:53:35,507 --> 00:53:36,647
It wasn't her song last time.

1457
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:37,777
I don't remember the title.

1458
00:53:37,777 --> 00:53:38,807
It's by Chae Jung An.

1459
00:53:38,807 --> 00:53:40,107
(What was it?)

1460
00:53:40,107 --> 00:53:41,147
It's Chae Jung An's...

1461
00:53:41,147 --> 00:53:42,247
What is it?

1462
00:53:42,247 --> 00:53:44,447
Song titles were short at this time.

1463
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:47,007
- It goes like this. - Right.

1464
00:53:47,007 --> 00:53:48,077
Continue the music.

1465
00:53:50,547 --> 00:53:52,247
It's definitely by Chae Jung An.

1466
00:53:52,547 --> 00:53:53,947
- It's by Chae Jung An. - I can't remember the title.

1467
00:53:53,947 --> 00:53:55,607
It goes like this.

1468
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,107
- I have no idea. - It goes like this.

1469
00:53:57,107 --> 00:53:58,677
How does it go?

1470
00:53:58,677 --> 00:54:00,107
What's the title?

1471
00:54:00,107 --> 00:54:02,007
All we need to know is the title.

1472
00:54:02,377 --> 00:54:03,907
I told you that it's by Chae Jung An.

1473
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,707
It really is.

1474
00:54:06,707 --> 00:54:08,407
(His body remembers the song.)

1475
00:54:08,407 --> 00:54:09,577
That's right.

1476
00:54:09,577 --> 00:54:11,407
- The lyrics are correct. - Wait.

1477
00:54:12,447 --> 00:54:13,977
- I know the answer. - Even if you do it

1478
00:54:13,977 --> 00:54:15,847
(He barges in.)

1479
00:54:16,607 --> 00:54:17,677
What's the answer?

1480
00:54:18,147 --> 00:54:19,377
"Gratitude" by Chae Jung An.

1481
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:22,777
(How can that be the title of a techno song?)

1482
00:54:22,777 --> 00:54:26,507
"Ula Ula Ulaleyo" by Chae Jung An.

1483
00:54:28,177 --> 00:54:29,777
That will cause us trouble.

1484
00:54:30,607 --> 00:54:31,947
I made a guess.

1485
00:54:33,707 --> 00:54:36,047
(Everyone remembers the song.)

1486
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:42,607
(They remember the lyrics.)

1487
00:54:43,477 --> 00:54:44,577
I know the answer.

1488
00:54:44,647 --> 00:54:46,047
- Is this it? - What is it?

1489
00:54:47,107 --> 00:54:50,347
(The song has a special refrain.)

1490
00:54:50,347 --> 00:54:54,077
(If song titles from early 2000s were short...)

1491
00:54:54,077 --> 00:54:56,407
"Ula" by Chae Jung An.

1492
00:54:56,577 --> 00:54:58,507
- Come on. - Isn't it?

1493
00:54:58,577 --> 00:55:01,207
You'll hear the title in the second verse.

1494
00:55:01,277 --> 00:55:04,477
The second verse starts soon. Play music.

1495
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:06,177
Pupa?

1496
00:55:07,947 --> 00:55:09,947
(The second verse starts soon.)

1497
00:55:09,947 --> 00:55:10,947
Here it is.

1498
00:55:11,547 --> 00:55:14,777
(The song title is included in the lyrics of the 2nd verse.)

1499
00:55:14,777 --> 00:55:17,307
(The lyrics will determine the winner.)

1500
00:55:20,007 --> 00:55:22,447
(It's time to dance.)

1501
00:55:22,647 --> 00:55:26,007
- Dance time - Dance time

1502
00:55:26,007 --> 00:55:27,877
(The 2nd verse starts.)

1503
00:55:27,877 --> 00:55:29,807
(Love opened my eyes)

1504
00:55:29,807 --> 00:55:31,147
I know the answer.

1505
00:55:31,147 --> 00:55:32,447
- The answer is... - "Love" by Chae Jung An.

1506
00:55:32,447 --> 00:55:33,977
- "Love" by Chae Jung An. - That's not it.

1507
00:55:33,977 --> 00:55:35,107
She said love.

1508
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:36,247
Play music.

1509
00:55:36,947 --> 00:55:38,547
I know the answer.

1510
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:39,607
What?

1511
00:55:39,607 --> 00:55:41,277
- "Farewell" by Chae Jung An. - "Farewell".

1512
00:55:41,277 --> 00:55:42,607
That's wrong.

1513
00:55:42,607 --> 00:55:43,877
Everyone goes one by one.

1514
00:55:43,877 --> 00:55:45,447
- I know the answer. - Take a guess.

1515
00:55:45,447 --> 00:55:46,607
- "Regrets" by Chae Jung An. - Step back.

1516
00:55:46,607 --> 00:55:47,647
Step back.

1517
00:55:47,647 --> 00:55:49,007
Let's step back.

1518
00:55:49,007 --> 00:55:50,007
Let's step back.

1519
00:55:50,007 --> 00:55:51,477
We started here.

1520
00:55:51,477 --> 00:55:53,607
You'll hear it right away. Cue the music.

1521
00:55:53,607 --> 00:55:57,077
(They have to move fast.)

1522
00:55:58,877 --> 00:56:00,177
(Heartless)

1523
00:56:00,177 --> 00:56:01,177
I'll answer!

1524
00:56:01,177 --> 00:56:02,877
(I'll answer!)

1525
00:56:03,607 --> 00:56:05,107
"Heartless" by Chae Jung An.

1526
00:56:05,107 --> 00:56:06,407
(Correct)

1527
00:56:06,407 --> 00:56:08,007
"Heartless"!

1528
00:56:08,007 --> 00:56:09,077
We need to pull ourselves together.

1529
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:10,307
You know this, right?

1530
00:56:11,407 --> 00:56:15,547
("Heartless" is Chae Jung An's debut song.)

1531
00:56:15,547 --> 00:56:19,107
(The lyrics and performance have been loved for a long time.)

1532
00:56:19,907 --> 00:56:21,547
It was "Heartless".

1533
00:56:21,547 --> 00:56:23,777
Cue the music.

1534
00:56:23,777 --> 00:56:26,707
(Heartless)

1535
00:56:27,607 --> 00:56:30,377
(Seok Jin dances to the techno music.)

1536
00:56:30,647 --> 00:56:32,377
- Rock-paper-scissors. - I hope this will be the last time.

1537
00:56:32,547 --> 00:56:34,707
Please end this pain.

1538
00:56:34,707 --> 00:56:35,707
It's so painful!

1539
00:56:35,707 --> 00:56:37,247
Rock-paper-scissors.

1540
00:56:37,247 --> 00:56:40,907
(It's also painful for the staff who has to listen to Seok Jin sing.)

1541
00:56:40,907 --> 00:56:42,777
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1542
00:56:42,907 --> 00:56:44,107
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1543
00:56:44,107 --> 00:56:45,707
I'll stop as soon as the second verse starts.

1544
00:56:46,307 --> 00:56:48,407
(The 2nd verse starts.)

1545
00:56:48,407 --> 00:56:49,407
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1546
00:56:50,177 --> 00:56:51,177
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1547
00:56:51,247 --> 00:56:52,977
(They're desperate.)

1548
00:56:52,977 --> 00:56:54,007
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1549
00:56:54,207 --> 00:56:55,847
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1550
00:56:56,207 --> 00:56:57,647
It's coming soon.

1551
00:56:58,347 --> 00:56:59,377
We're almost there.

1552
00:56:59,977 --> 00:57:01,707
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1553
00:57:01,707 --> 00:57:03,707
(Who will be penalized this time?)

1554
00:57:03,707 --> 00:57:05,207
- Yes! - Let's go.

1555
00:57:05,207 --> 00:57:06,347
Stop!

1556
00:57:07,547 --> 00:57:09,307
(Ji Hyo)

1557
00:57:09,807 --> 00:57:11,007
Stop!

1558
00:57:11,777 --> 00:57:14,277
(Ji Hyo falls into the trap.)

1559
00:57:14,277 --> 00:57:16,647
1, 2, 3.

1560
00:57:19,377 --> 00:57:20,707
(Ji Hyo enters the water.)

1561
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:23,747
(Her movements look cool.)

1562
00:57:24,907 --> 00:57:26,147
(Team White wins by a score of 4 to 0.)

1563
00:57:26,147 --> 00:57:27,347
Are you okay?

1564
00:57:27,407 --> 00:57:29,577
- Team White wins. - Yes!

1565
00:57:29,707 --> 00:57:31,907
The songs were so old.

1566
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:33,477
You should have played new songs.

1567
00:57:33,607 --> 00:57:35,077
The result is out.

1568
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:38,347
Team White can spin the roulette wheel twice.

1569
00:57:38,347 --> 00:57:40,177
We can choose not to change the members too, right?

1570
00:57:40,177 --> 00:57:42,407
- Yes. - You have a Chance Card.

1571
00:57:42,407 --> 00:57:44,347
You have a Chance Card.

1572
00:57:44,647 --> 00:57:48,277
You're going to spin the wheel until I'm gone, right?

1573
00:57:49,077 --> 00:57:50,277
Guys.

1574
00:57:50,647 --> 00:57:51,807
Did you realize it now?

1575
00:57:51,807 --> 00:57:53,777
- I mean... - Choose Stay.

1576
00:57:53,777 --> 00:57:54,777
I mean...

1577
00:57:54,777 --> 00:57:57,347
You might be sent too. You should know that.

1578
00:57:57,377 --> 00:57:58,607
You should use your chance.

1579
00:57:58,607 --> 00:58:00,507
Let's spin the wheel.

1580
00:58:00,507 --> 00:58:01,507
- Let's go! - Come on.

1581
00:58:02,207 --> 00:58:04,277
Hey, I have a 25-percent share.

1582
00:58:04,277 --> 00:58:06,877
We'll spin the wheel first.

1583
00:58:06,877 --> 00:58:08,147
Let's see.

1584
00:58:08,707 --> 00:58:10,407
- Kim... - Kim, Ji...

1585
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:13,107
I'll be sent with a 50-percent chance.

1586
00:58:14,077 --> 00:58:15,807
If So Min or I get chosen,

1587
00:58:15,807 --> 00:58:17,377
it'll be amazing.

1588
00:58:17,377 --> 00:58:18,507
It'll be fantastic.

1589
00:58:19,877 --> 00:58:21,107
(The roulette wheel is spinning.)

1590
00:58:21,107 --> 00:58:22,207
- Is it spinning? - Yes.

1591
00:58:22,807 --> 00:58:24,007
It's to decide who will come here, right?

1592
00:58:24,277 --> 00:58:25,277
Please.

1593
00:58:25,277 --> 00:58:27,277
(It's the last chance to change the team members.)

1594
00:58:27,277 --> 00:58:30,277
(Who will move to Team White?)

1595
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:32,077
- Kwang Soo. - Okay.

1596
00:58:32,077 --> 00:58:34,307
(Kwang Soo moves to Team White.)

1597
00:58:34,307 --> 00:58:36,377
It's Kwang Soo.

1598
00:58:36,377 --> 00:58:39,277
(They now just have to send Seok Jin away.)

1599
00:58:39,277 --> 00:58:42,147
If Seok Jin is sent away, it'll be perfect.

1600
00:58:42,147 --> 00:58:43,647
That's the plan.

1601
00:58:43,647 --> 00:58:45,747
We'll spin the wheel.

1602
00:58:46,007 --> 00:58:47,107
It'll be amazing if Seok Jin gets chosen.

1603
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:48,607
Why am I here?

1604
00:58:48,607 --> 00:58:50,707
If Seok Jin gets chosen, the game will be over.

1605
00:58:50,707 --> 00:58:53,147
(If Seok Jin gets chosen, Team Black will have 3 Dud Men.)

1606
00:58:54,077 --> 00:58:55,507
- The game will be over. - Please.

1607
00:58:55,507 --> 00:58:57,107
It'll be over.

1608
00:58:57,107 --> 00:58:59,977
(Who will be sent to Team Black from Team White?)

1609
00:59:00,407 --> 00:59:01,407
I mean...

1610
00:59:02,777 --> 00:59:05,177
It'll be over.

1611
00:59:07,607 --> 00:59:08,647
(Jae Seok gets chosen.)

1612
00:59:08,647 --> 00:59:09,707
Jae Seok!

1613
00:59:09,707 --> 00:59:10,707
- You go. - Let's do it one more time.

1614
00:59:10,707 --> 00:59:11,907
- We'll use the Chance Card. - Are you using it?

1615
00:59:11,907 --> 00:59:13,707
We have to use it now.

1616
00:59:13,707 --> 00:59:15,447
- It'll become useless later. - We have to use it now.

1617
00:59:15,447 --> 00:59:17,647
- We have to use it now. - I have a 25-percent share.

1618
00:59:17,647 --> 00:59:20,007
Se Chan and I have 50-percent share combined.

1619
00:59:20,007 --> 00:59:21,777
We have a 50-percent share.

1620
00:59:21,777 --> 00:59:23,147
- We'll use the card. - I'm in too.

1621
00:59:23,147 --> 00:59:24,507
- We'll use it. - I have a 25-percent share too.

1622
00:59:24,507 --> 00:59:25,777
- Survive, Jae Seok. - Let's do it.

1623
00:59:25,777 --> 00:59:28,747
- The next slot is Seok Jin. - I hope Jae Seok will be chosen.

1624
00:59:29,977 --> 00:59:33,547
(If Seok Jin gets chosen, Team White will have no Dud Man.)

1625
00:59:34,347 --> 00:59:35,907
- Please. - I hope Jae Seok will be chosen.

1626
00:59:35,907 --> 00:59:36,442
Please.

1627
00:59:36,534 --> 00:59:37,774
- Survive, Jae Seok. - Let's do it.

1628
00:59:37,804 --> 00:59:39,934
(They won another chance by using the Chance Card.)

1629
00:59:41,974 --> 00:59:45,674
(If Seok Jin gets chosen, Team White will have no Dud Man.)

1630
00:59:46,734 --> 00:59:49,404
(What will happen to the two teams?)

1631
00:59:50,034 --> 00:59:51,134
Seok Jin.

1632
00:59:51,134 --> 00:59:53,234
(Seok Jin is sent away.)

1633
00:59:53,234 --> 00:59:55,904
- Be quiet. - Was Seok Jin chosen?

1634
00:59:55,904 --> 00:59:59,904
(The non-Dud Men achieved independence.)

1635
01:00:00,274 --> 01:00:01,434
(Fussing)

1636
01:00:01,434 --> 01:00:02,904
It's Seok Jin.

1637
01:00:02,904 --> 01:00:04,134
(I tried so hard to win.)

1638
01:00:04,134 --> 01:00:05,234
It's Seok Jin.

1639
01:00:05,404 --> 01:00:06,434
It's perfect.

1640
01:00:06,434 --> 01:00:08,304
There's another round, right?

1641
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:09,974
I can't believe this.

1642
01:00:09,974 --> 01:00:11,504
- There's another round, right? - Yes.

1643
01:00:11,704 --> 01:00:12,734
My goodness.

1644
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,704
- It's perfect. - It's perfect.

1645
01:00:15,034 --> 01:00:16,034
I can't believe this.

1646
01:00:16,134 --> 01:00:18,034
- How can this happen? - It's perfect.

1647
01:00:18,034 --> 01:00:19,904
- It's perfect. - What about me?

1648
01:00:19,904 --> 01:00:21,534
What am I doing here?

1649
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,074
- Poor Ji Hyo. - What about me?

1650
01:00:23,074 --> 01:00:24,874
- Save me. - Poor Ji Hyo.

1651
01:00:24,874 --> 01:00:28,334
Change your clothes and move to the next place.

1652
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:29,334
- Okay. - Okay.

1653
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,734
(Will miracles continue to happen to Team White?)

1654
01:00:33,634 --> 01:00:36,004
Are we playing a name-tag game?

1655
01:00:36,604 --> 01:00:37,704
We play name-tag games whenever we're here.

1656
01:00:37,704 --> 01:00:39,274
We always play it here.

1657
01:00:39,534 --> 01:00:41,534
Our team has an advantage.

1658
01:00:42,234 --> 01:00:43,974
We look so weak.

1659
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:44,974
(All three Dud Men are on Team Black.)

1660
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:48,174
Before I introduce the final mission,

1661
01:00:48,174 --> 01:00:50,974
Team Black will put on red caps.

1662
01:00:50,974 --> 01:00:54,304
(Team Black will wear red caps.)

1663
01:00:54,304 --> 01:00:56,234
- Team White will put on blue caps. - Thank you.

1664
01:00:56,234 --> 01:00:57,234
What are we going to do?

1665
01:00:57,774 --> 01:00:59,804
- Are we doing something with them? - What are these?

1666
01:00:59,804 --> 01:01:02,034
(Why are we putting on caps?)

1667
01:01:02,034 --> 01:01:03,704
In the final mission,

1668
01:01:03,974 --> 01:01:06,734
you can reverse the situation.

1669
01:01:06,734 --> 01:01:08,634
It's Life-changing Name Tag Elimination.

1670
01:01:08,634 --> 01:01:09,634
Name Tag Elimination?

1671
01:01:09,634 --> 01:01:11,034
(Life-Changing Name Tag Elimination)

1672
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:15,774
(Life-Changing Name Tag Elimination?)

1673
01:01:15,774 --> 01:01:16,874
Is it Name Tag Elimination?

1674
01:01:17,504 --> 01:01:18,504
With these members?

1675
01:01:18,504 --> 01:01:20,774
(Team Black is at a disadvantage.)

1676
01:01:21,934 --> 01:01:25,404
The game will last 30 minutes.

1677
01:01:25,704 --> 01:01:29,434
If you rip someone's name tag off, you'll switch places.

1678
01:01:29,434 --> 01:01:36,934
(If you rip someone's name tag off, you'll switch places.)

1679
01:01:36,934 --> 01:01:39,704
The team with fewer Dud Men at the end of the game...

1680
01:01:39,704 --> 01:01:40,704
will win.

1681
01:01:40,804 --> 01:01:42,934
- Then... - Hold on.

1682
01:01:43,034 --> 01:01:44,974
We'll have to run away from them.

1683
01:01:44,974 --> 01:01:47,934
(Team White has to run away from Team Black.)

1684
01:01:49,404 --> 01:01:53,174
(Team Black will try to rip off Team White's name tags.)

1685
01:01:53,174 --> 01:01:55,774
(The game will change their lives.)

1686
01:01:56,904 --> 01:02:00,804
Member changes will be announced in real time.

1687
01:02:01,034 --> 01:02:04,304
Please keep an eye on the situation.

1688
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:05,304
(Team Blue versus Team Red)

1689
01:02:06,834 --> 01:02:08,604
(This final race will...)

1690
01:02:08,604 --> 01:02:11,634
(determine who will be sent to the Place for 1 Percent.)

1691
01:02:13,234 --> 01:02:15,974
Then we'll have to wait until the last minute.

1692
01:02:15,974 --> 01:02:17,234
(Then we'll have to wait until the last minute.)

1693
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,704
That sounds so easy.

1694
01:02:19,704 --> 01:02:21,934
He's the king of games.

1695
01:02:21,934 --> 01:02:23,304
Can you do that if you want to?

1696
01:02:23,304 --> 01:02:24,634
He can do it.

1697
01:02:24,634 --> 01:02:26,234
If I want to rip a name tag off, I can do it.

1698
01:02:26,234 --> 01:02:28,934
I can start when there is five minutes left.

1699
01:02:28,934 --> 01:02:30,504
(He'll start when there is 5 minutes left.)

1700
01:02:30,504 --> 01:02:32,034
Okay.

1701
01:02:32,034 --> 01:02:33,604
- He could do that. - Okay?

1702
01:02:33,604 --> 01:02:35,404
I'll just look around.

1703
01:02:35,774 --> 01:02:36,834
I'm jealous.

1704
01:02:37,034 --> 01:02:39,334
Please move to your starting points.

1705
01:02:39,334 --> 01:02:41,434
Let the Life-changing Name Tag Elimination begin.

1706
01:02:41,434 --> 01:02:42,604
- Gosh. - Let's go.

1707
01:02:42,604 --> 01:02:44,534
We'll have to hold out.

1708
01:02:45,074 --> 01:02:47,604
- Gosh. - Let's not waste our energy.

1709
01:02:47,904 --> 01:02:49,174
We don't know what will happen.

1710
01:02:49,174 --> 01:02:50,604
What will happen?

1711
01:02:50,604 --> 01:02:52,234
- You have to think. - Let's say...

1712
01:02:52,234 --> 01:02:54,874
they get the name tags of two of us.

1713
01:02:54,874 --> 01:02:59,504
The team with two Dud Men...

1714
01:02:59,504 --> 01:03:01,274
- will lose, right? - Yes.

1715
01:03:01,274 --> 01:03:02,534
If we lose two, it'll be over.

1716
01:03:02,534 --> 01:03:04,904
We can't rip off their name tags yet.

1717
01:03:04,904 --> 01:03:06,534
If we do that, we have to go to that team.

1718
01:03:06,534 --> 01:03:08,834
(Team Blue has to run away from the other team for now.)

1719
01:03:10,334 --> 01:03:12,474
We have to think carefully.

1720
01:03:12,874 --> 01:03:15,174
One of us has to...

1721
01:03:15,504 --> 01:03:17,704
- go to that team. - For us to have a chance.

1722
01:03:17,704 --> 01:03:19,104
One of us will survive.

1723
01:03:19,174 --> 01:03:21,104
- Only one of us will survive. - That's right.

1724
01:03:21,234 --> 01:03:22,734
Or we'll all lose.

1725
01:03:22,734 --> 01:03:24,504
(They aim to reverse the situation.)

1726
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:27,034
We can do this. Let's meet here.

1727
01:03:27,534 --> 01:03:28,904
- 1, 2, 3. - Let's do this.

1728
01:03:28,904 --> 01:03:29,974
- Let's meet here. - Okay.

1729
01:03:29,974 --> 01:03:31,234
We sound so discouraged.

1730
01:03:31,234 --> 01:03:32,274
(How will this race end?)

1731
01:03:32,274 --> 01:03:33,604
It's because I have a lot on my mind.

1732
01:03:33,604 --> 01:03:34,604
See you later.

1733
01:03:34,604 --> 01:03:36,774
(How will this race end?)

1734
01:03:38,604 --> 01:03:40,034
(They're at their starting points.)

1735
01:03:40,034 --> 01:03:41,304
In the beginning,

1736
01:03:42,134 --> 01:03:44,234
should I run away from them?

1737
01:03:44,234 --> 01:03:46,804
(Keeping your name tag doesn't guarantee anything.)

1738
01:03:46,804 --> 01:03:49,134
(It's important to watch the situation.)

1739
01:03:49,134 --> 01:03:50,574
I'll just have to try.

1740
01:03:51,904 --> 01:03:53,404
If you think about it,

1741
01:03:54,334 --> 01:03:57,034
it might not be a bad idea to do nothing.

1742
01:03:58,074 --> 01:04:01,234
They'll do their best to get our name tags.

1743
01:04:02,974 --> 01:04:03,974
Anyway...

1744
01:04:03,974 --> 01:04:04,974
(Thinking)

1745
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:07,574
If I think only about myself,

1746
01:04:07,974 --> 01:04:10,534
I should be the only Dud Man on the team.

1747
01:04:12,304 --> 01:04:15,534
It's not a competition between teams.

1748
01:04:15,534 --> 01:04:16,704
It's not.

1749
01:04:16,704 --> 01:04:18,404
- It's between individuals. - It's me against the others.

1750
01:04:18,874 --> 01:04:19,874
It's between individuals.

1751
01:04:19,874 --> 01:04:21,204
Who is talking to me?

1752
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:22,974
(It's me.)

1753
01:04:22,974 --> 01:04:24,374
- I'm alone here. - Your heart is talking to you.

1754
01:04:25,074 --> 01:04:26,234
Is it my heart?

1755
01:04:26,234 --> 01:04:28,234
It's your heart. It's a competition between individuals.

1756
01:04:28,234 --> 01:04:29,234
Okay.

1757
01:04:29,734 --> 01:04:31,004
- Jae Seok. - Yes?

1758
01:04:31,904 --> 01:04:34,504
I won't go after you. I don't want to.

1759
01:04:34,834 --> 01:04:37,874
- I don't want to compete with you. - Haha.

1760
01:04:37,904 --> 01:04:39,604
Just give Se Chan to me.

1761
01:04:39,604 --> 01:04:41,904
I'll switch with Se Chan.

1762
01:04:42,134 --> 01:04:43,704
Okay? Give Se Chan to me.

1763
01:04:43,704 --> 01:04:45,134
- Listen to me. - Hold him.

1764
01:04:45,134 --> 01:04:46,134
Haha.

1765
01:04:46,234 --> 01:04:48,374
Otherwise, I'll bring my members and attack you.

1766
01:04:48,974 --> 01:04:50,174
- Fine. - Just give me Se Chan.

1767
01:04:50,174 --> 01:04:51,874
- Fine. - I...

1768
01:04:51,874 --> 01:04:53,974
- never lie on the first deal. - Okay.

1769
01:04:53,974 --> 01:04:55,904
I'll hold out for the next 25 minutes.

1770
01:04:55,904 --> 01:04:56,934
All right.

1771
01:04:57,404 --> 01:04:58,404
I look forward to your cooperation.

1772
01:04:58,404 --> 01:04:59,674
We don't know how things will turn out.

1773
01:05:00,604 --> 01:05:02,204
This is so complicated.

1774
01:05:02,534 --> 01:05:03,674
This is driving me crazy.

1775
01:05:03,874 --> 01:05:05,074
I guess you really don't want to go.

1776
01:05:05,074 --> 01:05:06,874
No.

1777
01:05:07,134 --> 01:05:10,504
I really don't want to go, Jae Seok.

1778
01:05:10,904 --> 01:05:13,534
- Earlier... - I have a heavy heart.

1779
01:05:16,674 --> 01:05:17,704
Go.

1780
01:05:18,304 --> 01:05:19,904
I'll go if I have to.

1781
01:05:19,904 --> 01:05:21,204
He kept on talking about it.

1782
01:05:21,204 --> 01:05:23,074
(I'm going to survive on my own.)

1783
01:05:23,904 --> 01:05:25,034
Jong Kook.

1784
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:27,804
- Can you rip off my name tag? - Yours?

1785
01:05:28,404 --> 01:05:31,704
- You can come and rip off mine. - Jong Kook.

1786
01:05:32,704 --> 01:05:33,874
So Min.

1787
01:05:35,134 --> 01:05:36,304
Will you let me?

1788
01:05:36,304 --> 01:05:37,874
You can try.

1789
01:05:37,874 --> 01:05:39,904
(Come get it if you're feeling confident.)

1790
01:05:42,134 --> 01:05:43,334
What should I do?

1791
01:05:43,334 --> 01:05:45,174
(It might not be a good idea to rip off people's name tags.)

1792
01:05:45,774 --> 01:05:48,104
Let's get the race started.

1793
01:05:48,234 --> 01:05:49,234
10.

1794
01:05:49,234 --> 01:05:50,334
(There are only 30 minutes.)

1795
01:05:50,334 --> 01:05:51,404
Nine.

1796
01:05:51,404 --> 01:05:52,404
Let's hold out.

1797
01:05:52,404 --> 01:05:54,134
(As soon as your name tag comes off, your team changes.)

1798
01:05:54,134 --> 01:05:55,434
This requires a lot of thinking.

1799
01:05:56,074 --> 01:05:58,034
- Eight. - This is war.

1800
01:05:59,304 --> 01:06:01,974
- Seven. - I am afraid of heights.

1801
01:06:01,974 --> 01:06:03,974
(The team with more Dud Men will be penalized.)

1802
01:06:03,974 --> 01:06:05,234
My goodness.

1803
01:06:06,304 --> 01:06:07,404
Six.

1804
01:06:07,604 --> 01:06:09,604
Gosh, I don't want to go.

1805
01:06:10,704 --> 01:06:12,204
- Five. - I'm scared.

1806
01:06:12,204 --> 01:06:13,504
- Four. - It's starting.

1807
01:06:14,504 --> 01:06:15,534
Three.

1808
01:06:16,904 --> 01:06:17,974
Two.

1809
01:06:19,504 --> 01:06:20,674
Race starts now.

1810
01:06:21,074 --> 01:06:22,404
I have to go meet people.

1811
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:24,874
(The final race starts.)

1812
01:06:25,004 --> 01:06:26,774
(Seok Jin, Haha, and So Min are Dud Men.)

1813
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,234
Hold on.

1814
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,604
(Jae Seok is on the run.)

1815
01:06:29,604 --> 01:06:31,504
I have to run away for now.

1816
01:06:37,774 --> 01:06:38,804
There he is.

1817
01:06:38,804 --> 01:06:39,804
(Seok Jin finds Jae Seok.)

1818
01:06:39,804 --> 01:06:41,804
He's coming. It's Seok Jin.

1819
01:06:42,404 --> 01:06:44,804
I never thought I'd be running away from Seok Jin.

1820
01:06:45,704 --> 01:06:47,504
I need to run away from him.

1821
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:50,334
(He gets chased by the weakest member.)

1822
01:06:50,434 --> 01:06:51,434
Hey, Jae Seok.

1823
01:06:52,804 --> 01:06:56,504
(He must stay in Team Blue right now.)

1824
01:06:56,534 --> 01:06:58,534
- What? - Come here.

1825
01:06:59,504 --> 01:07:01,534
- I can't get your name tag anyway. - What?

1826
01:07:01,534 --> 01:07:02,874
You know that.

1827
01:07:03,674 --> 01:07:04,804
So Seok Jin,

1828
01:07:05,704 --> 01:07:06,934
let's think about this.

1829
01:07:07,234 --> 01:07:08,604
- Then... - All right.

1830
01:07:10,034 --> 01:07:11,804
Can you help me get Kwang Soo's name tag?

1831
01:07:12,404 --> 01:07:14,004
There's no point in doing that right now.

1832
01:07:14,874 --> 01:07:17,074
- You know what I mean? - You can help me get Kwang Soo.

1833
01:07:17,604 --> 01:07:19,404
If Kwang Soo leaves my team,

1834
01:07:19,404 --> 01:07:21,504
we'll get another Dud Man.

1835
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:22,604
You won't.

1836
01:07:22,604 --> 01:07:23,704
They won't go.

1837
01:07:23,704 --> 01:07:25,004
They won't go unless they're stupid.

1838
01:07:25,504 --> 01:07:27,004
They'll try to get me.

1839
01:07:27,134 --> 01:07:28,304
Think about it.

1840
01:07:28,304 --> 01:07:29,344
(It's all so complicated,)

1841
01:07:29,344 --> 01:07:31,704
(so let's rip off the name tag first.)

1842
01:07:31,704 --> 01:07:33,934
(Give me your name tag.)

1843
01:07:35,404 --> 01:07:36,534
Wait.

1844
01:07:36,534 --> 01:07:38,704
(As soon as your name tag comes off, you switch teams.)

1845
01:07:38,704 --> 01:07:39,904
- Wait. - I'm sorry.

1846
01:07:40,904 --> 01:07:41,934
I don't even know now.

1847
01:07:42,004 --> 01:07:43,134
I don't want the penalty.

1848
01:07:43,134 --> 01:07:44,504
(Jae Seok keeps on defending himself.)

1849
01:07:44,504 --> 01:07:45,974
I can't go, Jae Seok.

1850
01:07:46,344 --> 01:07:47,974
Please.

1851
01:07:48,404 --> 01:07:49,434
Don't do this.

1852
01:07:49,434 --> 01:07:52,134
- Help me get Kwang Soo's name tag. - Okay.

1853
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:54,344
(He gives up very fast.)

1854
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:56,904
(Or not?)

1855
01:07:56,904 --> 01:07:59,404
(Give me your name tag.)

1856
01:07:59,404 --> 01:08:01,404
- I'll help you get Kwang Soo. - Will you?

1857
01:08:02,604 --> 01:08:03,874
(That was a lie.)

1858
01:08:04,234 --> 01:08:05,304
That little...

1859
01:08:05,304 --> 01:08:08,434
(Jae Seok gets out of the situation by running away.)

1860
01:08:09,404 --> 01:08:11,804
(It's so easy to fool Seok Jin.)

1861
01:08:11,974 --> 01:08:13,104
I have to go this way anyway.

1862
01:08:13,104 --> 01:08:14,934
(He tries to keep his pride.)

1863
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:18,434
(You got lucky, Jae Seok.)

1864
01:08:19,004 --> 01:08:20,344
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo is here.)

1865
01:08:20,344 --> 01:08:22,074
I have no choice but to run away.

1866
01:08:24,104 --> 01:08:25,174
Let's hold out.

1867
01:08:26,234 --> 01:08:27,874
I must hold out.

1868
01:08:28,874 --> 01:08:29,904
Let's hold out.

1869
01:08:31,304 --> 01:08:32,404
Kwang Soo.

1870
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:34,304
Jong Kook.

1871
01:08:34,704 --> 01:08:35,804
Come here.

1872
01:08:36,504 --> 01:08:37,934
It's 30 minutes.

1873
01:08:40,974 --> 01:08:42,434
Here comes So Min.

1874
01:08:42,434 --> 01:08:44,304
(So Min comes by.)

1875
01:08:44,304 --> 01:08:45,304
(They run away from Team Red.)

1876
01:08:45,304 --> 01:08:46,534
What is she thinking?

1877
01:08:47,304 --> 01:08:49,344
Why are you running away?

1878
01:08:50,344 --> 01:08:51,404
You startled me.

1879
01:08:51,904 --> 01:08:55,934
(Ji Hyo was waiting on the 2nd floor.)

1880
01:08:57,674 --> 01:09:00,934
(So Min lures them,)

1881
01:09:00,934 --> 01:09:03,774
(and Ji Hyo will attack.)

1882
01:09:03,774 --> 01:09:06,134
(Ji Hyo and So Min are on their way.)

1883
01:09:06,134 --> 01:09:07,304
Jong Kook.

1884
01:09:07,304 --> 01:09:08,344
I'm sorry.

1885
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:10,504
(Ji Hyo is after Jong Kook.)

1886
01:09:10,504 --> 01:09:12,074
I'm sorry. Run, Jong Kook.

1887
01:09:12,304 --> 01:09:13,344
I'm sorry.

1888
01:09:13,534 --> 01:09:14,704
Hang in there.

1889
01:09:14,704 --> 01:09:16,504
(So Min is after Kwang Soo.)

1890
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:18,434
Hang in there.

1891
01:09:22,874 --> 01:09:24,134
Catch him.

1892
01:09:24,134 --> 01:09:25,404
(Haha is in the front.)

1893
01:09:25,404 --> 01:09:27,504
(So Min is in the back.)

1894
01:09:28,204 --> 01:09:32,434
(Can you give me your name tag, Kwang Soo?)

1895
01:09:34,234 --> 01:09:35,344
What are you doing? Run.

1896
01:09:35,704 --> 01:09:36,774
Run.

1897
01:09:37,934 --> 01:09:39,074
Catch him.

1898
01:09:39,904 --> 01:09:41,004
(Dashing)

1899
01:09:42,674 --> 01:09:45,804
(Haha is after Kwang Soo now. So Min changes her target.)

1900
01:09:45,804 --> 01:09:47,774
Guys. Why are you doing this to me?

1901
01:09:48,344 --> 01:09:50,404
- Let's do this together, Kwang Soo. - Do what together?

1902
01:09:50,404 --> 01:09:51,604
- Let's catch Se Chan. - Do what together?

1903
01:09:52,004 --> 01:09:53,234
What are you saying?

1904
01:09:53,874 --> 01:09:54,904
Let's catch Se Chan.

1905
01:09:54,974 --> 01:09:56,904
- We have to get Jong Kook. - What?

1906
01:09:56,904 --> 01:09:58,504
- We have to get him. - We can't.

1907
01:09:59,034 --> 01:10:00,204
- Wait. - Let go first.

1908
01:10:00,204 --> 01:10:01,804
- Let's talk. - What are you planning to do?

1909
01:10:01,804 --> 01:10:03,504
- Let's talk. - Why me?

1910
01:10:03,504 --> 01:10:05,304
- We won't do anything. - Go somewhere else first.

1911
01:10:05,304 --> 01:10:07,134
Go somewhere else. Why are you doing this to me?

1912
01:10:07,134 --> 01:10:08,704
- Fine. We'll go somewhere else. - Good. Come back.

1913
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:09,804
Let go.

1914
01:10:09,804 --> 01:10:10,874
(Let's talk first, Jong Kook.)

1915
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:12,344
- My hair. - Here.

1916
01:10:12,704 --> 01:10:15,504
- Hey, why are you doing this? - Let's talk.

1917
01:10:15,504 --> 01:10:18,304
What are you thinking? Tell me what you're thinking.

1918
01:10:18,704 --> 01:10:20,604
Help us get one person. Please save So Min and me.

1919
01:10:20,604 --> 01:10:21,604
- Please, Jong Kook. - Who do you want?

1920
01:10:21,604 --> 01:10:23,174
If either of us go to your room...

1921
01:10:23,174 --> 01:10:25,904
What if we get a Dud Man on our team then?

1922
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:27,434
You have to stop that from happening.

1923
01:10:27,434 --> 01:10:29,174
(She's so square.)

1924
01:10:29,904 --> 01:10:31,344
- What? - You have to stop it.

1925
01:10:31,674 --> 01:10:33,404
- What? - You have to stop it.

1926
01:10:33,504 --> 01:10:34,774
So we can't...

1927
01:10:34,774 --> 01:10:36,934
let people know that we're allies.

1928
01:10:36,934 --> 01:10:39,304
Stay far away and once you catch your target,

1929
01:10:39,604 --> 01:10:41,074
I'll go...

1930
01:10:41,074 --> 01:10:42,904
and pretend like I'm helping. But I'll catch them for you.

1931
01:10:42,904 --> 01:10:44,174
- Okay. Really? - Yes.

1932
01:10:44,174 --> 01:10:45,434
- You have to help us. - Okay.

1933
01:10:45,434 --> 01:10:47,134
- Don't touch me then. - Okay.

1934
01:10:47,134 --> 01:10:48,904
As soon as you touch me,

1935
01:10:49,234 --> 01:10:50,804
I'll destroy you.

1936
01:10:51,344 --> 01:10:53,604
- Gosh. - He's really strong.

1937
01:10:54,034 --> 01:10:56,034
Hey, did you just realise that?

1938
01:10:57,534 --> 01:11:00,034
- Hey. - The lights won't go out.

1939
01:11:00,034 --> 01:11:01,504
- Hurry up. - What were you planning on doing?

1940
01:11:01,804 --> 01:11:03,434
My goodness.

1941
01:11:03,974 --> 01:11:05,074
I have no choice.

1942
01:11:05,074 --> 01:11:07,204
- We just got started. - I know.

1943
01:11:07,204 --> 01:11:09,404
I have no choice, Kwang Soo.

1944
01:11:10,004 --> 01:11:11,134
You should rip mine off.

1945
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:12,974
You can rip my name tag off.

1946
01:11:12,974 --> 01:11:14,034
What are you talking about?

1947
01:11:14,434 --> 01:11:15,934
Rip it off.

1948
01:11:16,104 --> 01:11:17,974
Here it is. Rip it right off.

1949
01:11:18,604 --> 01:11:20,174
- Please. - Kwang Soo.

1950
01:11:20,674 --> 01:11:21,904
You can rip mine off.

1951
01:11:21,974 --> 01:11:23,504
I have to survive.

1952
01:11:23,504 --> 01:11:24,804
Rip it off. Go ahead.

1953
01:11:24,904 --> 01:11:26,704
Good job.

1954
01:11:26,704 --> 01:11:27,704
Here it is.

1955
01:11:27,704 --> 01:11:30,034
- I have to survive. - Rip it off.

1956
01:11:30,034 --> 01:11:31,504
- Try harder. - No.

1957
01:11:31,504 --> 01:11:33,174
Just hold onto it. I'll do the rest.

1958
01:11:33,534 --> 01:11:34,704
- Please. - Save me.

1959
01:11:35,504 --> 01:11:36,674
Please, Kwang Soo.

1960
01:11:36,804 --> 01:11:37,804
I'm sorry.

1961
01:11:39,304 --> 01:11:40,404
I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

1962
01:11:40,404 --> 01:11:41,904
(Ripping)

1963
01:11:43,974 --> 01:11:46,504
(Haha and Kwang Soo switch teams.)

1964
01:11:46,504 --> 01:11:47,704
I'm really sorry, Kwang Soo.

1965
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:49,934
- I'm sorry. - Okay. Let's see how this ends.

1966
01:11:50,604 --> 01:11:51,804
Fine.

1967
01:11:52,404 --> 01:11:57,034
(Kwang Soo is on Team Red, and Haha is on Team Blue.)

1968
01:11:57,034 --> 01:12:02,104
Haha from Team Red and Kwang Soo from Team Blue...

1969
01:12:02,104 --> 01:12:04,134
have switched teams.

1970
01:12:04,804 --> 01:12:07,404
(Haha is on Team Blue now?)

1971
01:12:07,404 --> 01:12:08,604
Haha switched?

1972
01:12:10,504 --> 01:12:12,174
From the three of us...

1973
01:12:12,174 --> 01:12:14,344
One has to switch teams to make it a tight race.

1974
01:12:14,344 --> 01:12:15,504
Only one person will survive.

1975
01:12:15,704 --> 01:12:17,504
- 1 out of 3 will survive. - That's right.

1976
01:12:17,804 --> 01:12:19,104
Or we'll all die.

1977
01:12:19,104 --> 01:12:22,434
(As of right now, only Haha will be the only Dud Man to survive.)

1978
01:12:22,434 --> 01:12:24,904
(I'm saved.)

1979
01:12:26,404 --> 01:12:27,604
He ripped it off.

1980
01:12:28,534 --> 01:12:30,344
We just have to rip off Haha's now.

1981
01:12:32,804 --> 01:12:33,974
Let's join hands.

1982
01:12:34,404 --> 01:12:38,304
(How long can he be in Team Blue for?)

1983
01:12:39,004 --> 01:12:41,104
Kwang Soo is behind you.

1984
01:12:41,104 --> 01:12:42,674
(Kwang Soo is behind me?)

1985
01:12:42,674 --> 01:12:44,034
He's after me already.

1986
01:12:44,604 --> 01:12:46,604
(I won't leave you alone.)

1987
01:12:46,604 --> 01:12:48,004
He's after me already.

1988
01:12:48,674 --> 01:12:54,504
(If Kwang Soo gets me, I'll end up on the team full of Dud Men.)

1989
01:12:55,234 --> 01:12:56,604
That was close.

1990
01:12:57,234 --> 01:12:59,804
(He sprints away.)

1991
01:13:00,534 --> 01:13:03,134
(I just need one guy in a blue cap.)

1992
01:13:03,134 --> 01:13:04,204
He's coming.

1993
01:13:05,174 --> 01:13:08,504
(I got one.)

1994
01:13:08,504 --> 01:13:10,104
(Ripping)

1995
01:13:11,074 --> 01:13:14,174
(Kwang Soo and Se Chan switch teams.)

1996
01:13:14,174 --> 01:13:16,804
Why is it a dead-end here?

1997
01:13:17,104 --> 01:13:18,234
This is where I got mine ripped off too.

1998
01:13:18,234 --> 01:13:19,804
(Kwang Soo is safe for now.)

1999
01:13:19,804 --> 01:13:20,934
I'll get going.

2000
01:13:22,074 --> 01:13:24,534
Se Chan from Team Blue...

2001
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:28,934
got his name tag ripped off by Kwang Soo from Team Red.

2002
01:13:28,934 --> 01:13:30,104
Okay.

2003
01:13:30,704 --> 01:13:32,704
(Team Blue doesn't have more Dud Men, so it's still safe.)

2004
01:13:32,704 --> 01:13:33,804
Hello.

2005
01:13:34,234 --> 01:13:36,104
Excuse me. Come in.

2006
01:13:36,974 --> 01:13:38,344
(Let's hide in the waiting room.)

2007
01:13:38,344 --> 01:13:40,004
I'm not here. Please help me.

2008
01:13:40,304 --> 01:13:41,504
Excuse me.

2009
01:13:42,004 --> 01:13:43,504
I'm really sorry.

2010
01:13:44,344 --> 01:13:47,204
I'm good. Sit down.

2011
01:13:47,344 --> 01:13:48,974
It's okay.

2012
01:13:49,204 --> 01:13:50,304
I can't go.

2013
01:13:50,304 --> 01:13:52,934
(He hopes the teams don't change.)

2014
01:13:52,934 --> 01:13:55,344
I did everything I can. I'm going to stay here for 25 minutes.

2015
01:13:56,034 --> 01:13:58,074
So Min from Team Red...

2016
01:13:58,344 --> 01:14:01,034
ripped off the name tag of Team Blue's Jong Kook.

2017
01:14:01,034 --> 01:14:03,074
- Their teams have switched. - She's coming to Team Blue then.

2018
01:14:04,074 --> 01:14:06,344
My gosh. Why would she do that? Is she stupid?

2019
01:14:06,904 --> 01:14:10,434
(Team Blue is tainted now.)

2020
01:14:10,434 --> 01:14:13,074
(They must flee to Team Red now.)

2021
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:14,434
- So Min is on this team? - Yes.

2022
01:14:14,874 --> 01:14:15,974
Goodness.

2023
01:14:16,804 --> 01:14:17,904
My gosh.

2024
01:14:17,904 --> 01:14:20,504
(Team Blue has more Dud Men now.)

2025
01:14:20,504 --> 01:14:21,934
I have to switch over.

2026
01:14:22,504 --> 01:14:23,534
I have to switch.

2027
01:14:26,204 --> 01:14:27,344
(3 minutes ago in a confrontational situation)

2028
01:14:27,344 --> 01:14:29,004
Let's get Jong Kook. Come here.

2029
01:14:29,404 --> 01:14:30,974
- What are you going to do? - No, no.

2030
01:14:30,974 --> 01:14:32,534
- Hey. - Think first.

2031
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:34,204
There's no point in ripping his name tag off.

2032
01:14:34,204 --> 01:14:36,504
- We should switch caps. - Really?

2033
01:14:36,504 --> 01:14:37,604
Hey.

2034
01:14:37,604 --> 01:14:40,504
(We need a Dud Man to go over to Team Blue.)

2035
01:14:40,504 --> 01:14:42,074
- Hey. - What do we do with the caps?

2036
01:14:42,074 --> 01:14:44,804
Just let So Min rip his name tag off.

2037
01:14:45,504 --> 01:14:47,204
- What do we do with the caps? - Let her do it.

2038
01:14:47,204 --> 01:14:50,134
(Jong Kook, send So Min to your team.)

2039
01:14:50,134 --> 01:14:53,804
(It doesn't matter for Jong Kook if he gets switched.)

2040
01:14:53,804 --> 01:14:56,804
(Would Jong Kook and So Min switch according to Seok Jin's plan?)

2041
01:14:56,874 --> 01:14:58,104
Never mind.

2042
01:14:59,474 --> 01:15:00,904
Come here.

2043
01:15:00,904 --> 01:15:01,904
(They get started.)

2044
01:15:03,104 --> 01:15:04,174
Rip it off.

2045
01:15:05,204 --> 01:15:07,174
- So Min, rip it off. - Rip it off.

2046
01:15:09,344 --> 01:15:11,734
(Would this lame plan work?)

2047
01:15:12,104 --> 01:15:13,174
(Ripping)

2048
01:15:14,404 --> 01:15:17,204
(So Min rips Jong Kook's name tag off.)

2049
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:19,174
(Seok Jin's plan worked.)

2050
01:15:19,174 --> 01:15:20,904
- All right. - I'm sorry.

2051
01:15:20,904 --> 01:15:22,574
- It's okay. - Jong Kook.

2052
01:15:23,504 --> 01:15:25,004
- You know, right? - Of course.

2053
01:15:25,004 --> 01:15:27,634
He's so smart. I just had to look at him.

2054
01:15:27,634 --> 01:15:28,804
(What? What happened?)

2055
01:15:29,104 --> 01:15:30,604
I'll stay here. I'll hide.

2056
01:15:30,604 --> 01:15:31,974
- Okay. We're one. - I'll stay here.

2057
01:15:32,344 --> 01:15:34,634
- We have to run. - Their teams have...

2058
01:15:34,734 --> 01:15:36,574
switched.

2059
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:37,774
He's so good.

2060
01:15:37,974 --> 01:15:39,204
- We're fine. - This is good.

2061
01:15:39,374 --> 01:15:40,504
Yes.

2062
01:15:40,634 --> 01:15:42,004
What?

2063
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:44,634
What happened? Seok Jin.

2064
01:15:44,804 --> 01:15:46,904
That was so mean of you.

2065
01:15:46,904 --> 01:15:47,974
What?

2066
01:15:47,974 --> 01:15:50,074
- You tricked me. - That's how the world works.

2067
01:15:50,534 --> 01:15:51,974
- That's how it works. - Seok Jin.

2068
01:15:51,974 --> 01:15:53,734
- How can you do this to me? - What? What are you going to do?

2069
01:15:53,734 --> 01:15:56,474
I won't do anything. Why did you lie to me?

2070
01:15:56,474 --> 01:15:57,534
I didn't.

2071
01:16:00,534 --> 01:16:02,104
(He can hear Kwang Soo gasping...)

2072
01:16:02,104 --> 01:16:04,804
(and coming after him.)

2073
01:16:04,804 --> 01:16:06,104
(Kwang Soo's target is Seok Jin.)

2074
01:16:06,104 --> 01:16:07,704
Why are you after me? You shouldn't rip mine off.

2075
01:16:07,704 --> 01:16:09,844
(Please)

2076
01:16:09,844 --> 01:16:10,904
(It's time to switch over to Team Red.)

2077
01:16:10,904 --> 01:16:13,004
Why would you rip mine off? It doesn't matter.

2078
01:16:13,844 --> 01:16:15,874
Why would you rip mine off?

2079
01:16:16,074 --> 01:16:17,104
I don't even know.

2080
01:16:17,104 --> 01:16:18,204
I don't know.

2081
01:16:19,574 --> 01:16:21,204
Why would you rip mine off?

2082
01:16:21,404 --> 01:16:22,474
I'm leaving.

2083
01:16:22,474 --> 01:16:23,674
Can you help me?

2084
01:16:23,674 --> 01:16:25,844
Kwang Soo from Team Blue...

2085
01:16:26,004 --> 01:16:28,844
ripped off the name tag of Team Red's Seok Jin.

2086
01:16:28,904 --> 01:16:30,904
Their teams have switched.

2087
01:16:31,344 --> 01:16:32,604
This is the worst place to be.

2088
01:16:32,604 --> 01:16:33,734
(This is the worst place to be.)

2089
01:16:33,734 --> 01:16:36,174
My gosh. It's the opposite now.

2090
01:16:36,304 --> 01:16:38,104
- Jong Kook. - Do we have no Dud Man at all?

2091
01:16:38,104 --> 01:16:40,174
- We don't. - Rip it off. There's Kwang Soo.

2092
01:16:40,174 --> 01:16:42,804
(They can't just sit and watch now.)

2093
01:16:42,804 --> 01:16:44,974
(Seok Jin's target is Kwang Soo.)

2094
01:16:44,974 --> 01:16:46,004
Hey.

2095
01:16:46,004 --> 01:16:48,104
(They quarrel.)

2096
01:16:48,504 --> 01:16:50,304
So Min, get it.

2097
01:16:50,304 --> 01:16:52,104
No, So Min.

2098
01:16:52,104 --> 01:16:53,504
(This is for you.)

2099
01:16:53,504 --> 01:16:54,974
(Ripping)

2100
01:16:54,974 --> 01:16:57,874
(Kwang Soo is back to Team Blue after 1 minute.)

2101
01:16:57,874 --> 01:16:59,204
Run.

2102
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:02,504
What's going on? This is confusing.

2103
01:17:02,504 --> 01:17:04,404
(So Min and Kwang Soo switch.)

2104
01:17:04,404 --> 01:17:05,474
So...

2105
01:17:08,404 --> 01:17:12,104
(He's coming.)

2106
01:17:12,104 --> 01:17:16,344
(Somebody is coming.)

2107
01:17:16,344 --> 01:17:18,904
Wait. He's too fast.

2108
01:17:18,904 --> 01:17:21,374
Let's talk.

2109
01:17:21,474 --> 01:17:22,474
Hey.

2110
01:17:22,474 --> 01:17:25,104
Let's talk. Hold on.

2111
01:17:25,104 --> 01:17:27,004
Hold on.

2112
01:17:27,004 --> 01:17:29,404
Let's talk, Kwang Soo.

2113
01:17:29,534 --> 01:17:32,104
Sit down. Let's talk.

2114
01:17:32,304 --> 01:17:34,804
Kwang Soo, why are you trying to get me?

2115
01:17:34,804 --> 01:17:36,434
Think about it. What if you rip off mine,

2116
01:17:36,434 --> 01:17:38,004
and then I rip Haha's name tag off?

2117
01:17:38,204 --> 01:17:39,604
Then I'll rip yours off again.

2118
01:17:41,504 --> 01:17:42,634
You have to be smart.

2119
01:17:42,634 --> 01:17:43,674
(Kwang Soo doesn't budge.)

2120
01:17:43,674 --> 01:17:45,504
- Kwang Soo, become stupid again. - What?

2121
01:17:45,504 --> 01:17:47,504
(What?)

2122
01:17:47,504 --> 01:17:51,074
(All of a sudden?)

2123
01:17:51,074 --> 01:17:53,704
What are you talking about?

2124
01:17:54,004 --> 01:17:55,804
- Do you think I'm dumb? - Yes.

2125
01:17:59,204 --> 01:18:00,674
(Ripping)

2126
01:18:00,774 --> 01:18:04,904
(Se Chan becomes Kwang Soo's victim.)

2127
01:18:04,904 --> 01:18:05,904
(Kwang Soo and Se Chan switch.)

2128
01:18:05,904 --> 01:18:07,174
I'm sorry.

2129
01:18:07,174 --> 01:18:08,474
I'll remember this.

2130
01:18:08,604 --> 01:18:09,734
I'm sorry.

2131
01:18:10,904 --> 01:18:14,844
(He has a chance if he holds out for a little bit longer.)

2132
01:18:20,344 --> 01:18:21,474
Wait. What color are you?

2133
01:18:22,004 --> 01:18:23,844
Wait. That's not it.

2134
01:18:23,844 --> 01:18:25,804
Hold on.

2135
01:18:25,804 --> 01:18:28,174
Hold on. Jae Seok, listen to me.

2136
01:18:28,174 --> 01:18:30,174
Be quiet.

2137
01:18:30,174 --> 01:18:32,674
(It's survival of the fittest. Kwang Soo is the weak one here.)

2138
01:18:32,674 --> 01:18:33,674
Kwang Soo.

2139
01:18:34,344 --> 01:18:35,904
There are 10 minutes left.

2140
01:18:35,904 --> 01:18:38,074
(10 minutes until the race ends)

2141
01:18:39,344 --> 01:18:42,404
- Where's Ji Hyo? - These two have reasons to get you.

2142
01:18:42,404 --> 01:18:43,474
I'm sorry.

2143
01:18:43,474 --> 01:18:46,174
(Here are the blue guys.)

2144
01:18:46,904 --> 01:18:47,974
Do it.

2145
01:18:47,974 --> 01:18:49,904
- Kwang Soo. - Don't.

2146
01:18:51,404 --> 01:18:53,204
(It looks like Team Blue is getting attacked.)

2147
01:18:53,204 --> 01:18:54,344
Right now...

2148
01:18:54,344 --> 01:18:55,774
Rip it off.

2149
01:18:55,904 --> 01:18:59,374
You like ripping them off. Go ahead.

2150
01:18:59,604 --> 01:19:01,904
Rip it off. It's your specialty.

2151
01:19:02,604 --> 01:19:05,674
You rip these off more often than you eat chicken breasts. Do it.

2152
01:19:06,344 --> 01:19:08,534
Rip it off. Do it!

2153
01:19:09,074 --> 01:19:11,004
- Come on. - She's so strong.

2154
01:19:11,004 --> 01:19:12,104
Wait.

2155
01:19:12,604 --> 01:19:14,004
(He rips it off and puts it back on.)

2156
01:19:14,004 --> 01:19:16,074
(Turning)

2157
01:19:16,074 --> 01:19:17,204
(Was that not good enough?)

2158
01:19:17,204 --> 01:19:19,104
What are you doing?

2159
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:23,634
- There are 10 minutes left. - There's still time.

2160
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:25,404
- Wait five more minutes. - I'm going to rip it off and hide.

2161
01:19:25,404 --> 01:19:27,404
- Come on. - Mine got ripped eight times today.

2162
01:19:27,404 --> 01:19:29,734
Let's rest now and do it later.

2163
01:19:30,204 --> 01:19:31,374
Please do it for us.

2164
01:19:32,074 --> 01:19:35,404
(Goodness)

2165
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:37,404
(The tiger is on top of the food chain.)

2166
01:19:37,404 --> 01:19:39,574
No, Jong Kook.

2167
01:19:39,774 --> 01:19:42,074
- I won't rip yours off. - Do it later.

2168
01:19:42,074 --> 01:19:43,204
I wasn't even thinking of getting you.

2169
01:19:43,204 --> 01:19:44,344
Do it later.

2170
01:19:44,904 --> 01:19:47,534
What did I say? Let's do it later.

2171
01:19:49,274 --> 01:19:50,574
Jong Kook.

2172
01:19:51,004 --> 01:19:53,304
I'll go to him. I'll ask him to protect me.

2173
01:19:54,004 --> 01:19:55,104
I'll ask him.

2174
01:19:56,534 --> 01:19:57,604
There she is.

2175
01:19:58,004 --> 01:20:00,204
(I have to stay here to survive.)

2176
01:20:00,204 --> 01:20:01,274
(Seok Jin's only target is So Min.)

2177
01:20:01,274 --> 01:20:03,204
There she is. Catch her.

2178
01:20:03,474 --> 01:20:05,304
- Come here, So Min. - Seok Jin.

2179
01:20:05,504 --> 01:20:07,574
- Seok Jin. - I have something to say.

2180
01:20:08,504 --> 01:20:09,574
You.

2181
01:20:09,574 --> 01:20:10,774
(She lies down.)

2182
01:20:10,774 --> 01:20:13,004
I have nothing to say.

2183
01:20:13,734 --> 01:20:15,634
- Seok Jin. - This is awkward.

2184
01:20:15,634 --> 01:20:19,004
I'll give it to you if you win in rock, paper, scissors.

2185
01:20:19,004 --> 01:20:21,304
(She makes a proposal.)

2186
01:20:21,304 --> 01:20:23,734
If you lose, let me go.

2187
01:20:23,734 --> 01:20:25,434
I can't let you go.

2188
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:26,574
Let me go.

2189
01:20:26,904 --> 01:20:28,474
You have to win three times in a row then.

2190
01:20:28,474 --> 01:20:30,104
How am I supposed to do that?

2191
01:20:30,104 --> 01:20:31,774
(What's that about?)

2192
01:20:31,774 --> 01:20:34,874
That's what you did to Kwang Soo.

2193
01:20:34,904 --> 01:20:37,004
I'm doing what you did.

2194
01:20:37,074 --> 01:20:39,504
- He had to win three times. - Jae Seok on Team Red...

2195
01:20:39,504 --> 01:20:41,604
(There's an announcement.)

2196
01:20:41,604 --> 01:20:44,004
- Jae Seok on Team Red... - What?

2197
01:20:44,004 --> 01:20:48,704
ripped off Haha's name tag from Team Blue. Their teams have switched.

2198
01:20:48,704 --> 01:20:51,904
(Team Red has 2 Dud Men now.)

2199
01:20:52,804 --> 01:21:00,774
(Team Red is tainted again. They must switch over to Team Blue.)

2200
01:21:00,774 --> 01:21:01,844
What does that mean?

2201
01:21:01,844 --> 01:21:05,104
(The table has been turned.)

2202
01:21:06,104 --> 01:21:07,634
(Ripping)

2203
01:21:08,004 --> 01:21:09,374
(Kwang Soo gets his taken off instantly.)

2204
01:21:09,374 --> 01:21:10,434
Come here.

2205
01:21:11,904 --> 01:21:13,074
Run!

2206
01:21:13,074 --> 01:21:15,304
(You'll die once you get caught.)

2207
01:21:15,304 --> 01:21:18,304
What's going on? Come on.

2208
01:21:18,474 --> 01:21:20,674
Why are you doing this?

2209
01:21:20,734 --> 01:21:24,734
Hey, why is she doing this? Don't do this to me.

2210
01:21:24,734 --> 01:21:28,004
Ji Hyo. Ji Hyo!

2211
01:21:28,004 --> 01:21:29,404
(She snatched his name tag...)

2212
01:21:29,404 --> 01:21:33,104
(and ripped it off.)

2213
01:21:33,204 --> 01:21:35,074
- What did it say? - Haha...

2214
01:21:35,074 --> 01:21:36,074
(It's reversed now.)

2215
01:21:37,004 --> 01:21:38,204
What happened?

2216
01:21:38,204 --> 01:21:40,634
(Oh, right. That's what happened.)

2217
01:21:41,304 --> 01:21:42,844
What just happened?

2218
01:21:42,904 --> 01:21:45,074
- I should have switched with him. - What now?

2219
01:21:45,604 --> 01:21:46,804
What happened?

2220
01:21:46,804 --> 01:21:49,404
(Dud Man Haha is on Team Red now, so Team Blue is the safe zone.)

2221
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:51,374
I should have switched with him. That was close.

2222
01:21:52,634 --> 01:21:55,344
(Blue Dud Man runs away,)

2223
01:21:55,344 --> 01:21:56,704
(and Red Dud Man chases him.)

2224
01:21:56,704 --> 01:21:57,844
I'm tired.

2225
01:21:57,844 --> 01:22:02,204
(Who will be the one Dud Man that will remain in the safe zone?)

2226
01:22:02,204 --> 01:22:03,904
- So Min is coming. - What?

2227
01:22:04,204 --> 01:22:06,604
Come. She saw us.

2228
01:22:06,604 --> 01:22:10,474
(It's best to avoid Team Red.)

2229
01:22:13,504 --> 01:22:15,704
I'm tired.

2230
01:22:15,704 --> 01:22:17,204
Five minutes remaining.

2231
01:22:17,204 --> 01:22:18,534
(Let me hide here.)

2232
01:22:21,534 --> 01:22:26,634
Five minutes remaining.

2233
01:22:28,344 --> 01:22:29,604
Right now,

2234
01:22:31,204 --> 01:22:34,634
I turned on my phone camera. I lost my cameraman.

2235
01:22:35,844 --> 01:22:38,874
I was running away and lost him.

2236
01:22:39,504 --> 01:22:42,004
I was being chased by So Min.

2237
01:22:42,004 --> 01:22:45,574
I'm hiding right now. There are only three minutes left.

2238
01:22:47,074 --> 01:22:49,604
Please cheer me on.

2239
01:22:52,874 --> 01:22:56,704
(Will Seok Jin be safe for the remaining time?)

2240
01:22:56,704 --> 01:23:01,344
(Ready or not, here I come.)

2241
01:23:01,344 --> 01:23:04,304
(So Min approaches him.)

2242
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:08,844
(Please go. His mouth is getting dry.)

2243
01:23:09,704 --> 01:23:15,904
(She gets near him.)

2244
01:23:16,344 --> 01:23:18,274
He went out that way.

2245
01:23:20,904 --> 01:23:23,304
(She fails to spot him.)

2246
01:23:23,304 --> 01:23:25,404
He went out this way.

2247
01:23:26,104 --> 01:23:28,174
You have five minutes remaining.

2248
01:23:28,374 --> 01:23:29,734
Who's on our team?

2249
01:23:29,974 --> 01:23:32,474
- It's going to change near the end. - You have Seok Jin.

2250
01:23:32,534 --> 01:23:34,204
Seok Jin will get his ripped off.

2251
01:23:34,204 --> 01:23:36,004
It's likely So Min will be the one to do that.

2252
01:23:36,004 --> 01:23:37,574
Let's go to her.

2253
01:23:37,574 --> 01:23:39,504
Let's sit and watch first.

2254
01:23:40,344 --> 01:23:42,504
- Goodness. - So Min...

2255
01:23:42,504 --> 01:23:45,574
I think there will be chaos when we have two minutes left.

2256
01:23:47,804 --> 01:23:50,004
(It's almost the end of the race.)

2257
01:23:50,004 --> 01:23:51,404
Right now,

2258
01:23:51,734 --> 01:23:54,974
it's Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, Seok Jin, and me, right?

2259
01:23:56,004 --> 01:23:58,574
(Is this the right time?)

2260
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:01,974
What's wrong with you guys? You have to look at the big picture.

2261
01:24:01,974 --> 01:24:04,604
(He was talking about a "big picture" all this time.)

2262
01:24:04,604 --> 01:24:07,204
Kwang Soo, Se Chan, Haha, and So Min.

2263
01:24:07,204 --> 01:24:08,974
(He checks who are on the other team.)

2264
01:24:08,974 --> 01:24:10,974
They're all vicious.

2265
01:24:12,904 --> 01:24:17,574
(What is Jae Seok's big picture?)

2266
01:24:20,574 --> 01:24:25,574
(A month and a half ago in Japan)

2267
01:24:25,574 --> 01:24:28,734
(Dangerous Tourist Attractions Project ended that day.)

2268
01:24:29,174 --> 01:24:33,374
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo were exempt from any penalty.)

2269
01:24:33,374 --> 01:24:37,304
(With the start of a new project,)

2270
01:24:37,304 --> 01:24:42,734
(Jae Seok's big picture started.)

2271
01:24:44,104 --> 01:24:46,604
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo)

2272
01:24:46,604 --> 01:24:49,844
(I'll send those two.)

2273
01:24:51,474 --> 01:24:55,604
(In order to send Jong Kook and Ji Hyo abroad,)

2274
01:24:55,604 --> 01:24:58,904
(one of Team Red's Dud Men has to go over to Team Blue.)

2275
01:24:59,004 --> 01:25:00,844
You have one minute before the race is over.

2276
01:25:00,844 --> 01:25:01,844
Goodness.

2277
01:25:01,844 --> 01:25:06,374
(He only has one minute left. What will be his decision?)

2278
01:25:10,634 --> 01:25:14,304
(Hello, So Min.)

2279
01:25:14,304 --> 01:25:16,574
(What's going on now?)

2280
01:25:16,574 --> 01:25:19,504
(He chases after her.)

2281
01:25:19,844 --> 01:25:21,904
(To achieve his big goal,)

2282
01:25:21,904 --> 01:25:23,274
You must see the bigger picture.

2283
01:25:23,804 --> 01:25:26,504
(a small sacrifice is necessary.)

2284
01:25:26,504 --> 01:25:28,874
Come on, Jae Seok.

2285
01:25:29,704 --> 01:25:31,604
You have 10 seconds.

2286
01:25:31,604 --> 01:25:33,374
- Hurry up. - 10.

2287
01:25:33,374 --> 01:25:34,474
Seok Jin isn't here.

2288
01:25:34,474 --> 01:25:35,774
- Look for Ji Hyo. - I must find Ji Hyo.

2289
01:25:36,604 --> 01:25:38,474
(Team Blue must survive for 10 seconds.)

2290
01:25:38,604 --> 01:25:41,204
(Team Red tries to turn the tables.)

2291
01:25:41,374 --> 01:25:44,634
(Everything depends on the last 10 seconds.)

2292
01:25:44,634 --> 01:25:46,534
- Hurry. - Goodness.

2293
01:25:47,704 --> 01:25:49,704
- One. - The race is over.

2294
01:25:49,844 --> 01:25:52,204
Time is up.

2295
01:25:52,204 --> 01:25:53,304
(Life-changing race is over.)

2296
01:25:55,504 --> 01:25:58,304
The race is over.

2297
01:25:58,304 --> 01:26:00,574
(If the team members stayed the same...)

2298
01:26:00,574 --> 01:26:01,734
The race is over.

2299
01:26:04,204 --> 01:26:10,674
(The fate of two teams depend on So Min and Jae Seok.)

2300
01:26:10,904 --> 01:26:14,574
(If he takes off So Min's name tag, Team Blue will be punished.)

2301
01:26:15,274 --> 01:26:19,844
(Did Jae Seok rip off So Min's name tag?)

2302
01:26:20,404 --> 01:26:23,274
- The race is over. - Where's So Min?

2303
01:26:25,804 --> 01:26:27,204
Where were you hiding?

2304
01:26:27,204 --> 01:26:29,204
- I was in the makeup room. - Were you hiding?

2305
01:26:29,804 --> 01:26:30,844
I couldn't find you.

2306
01:26:30,844 --> 01:26:32,844
Where were you?

2307
01:26:32,844 --> 01:26:37,574
(What's the color of So Min's cap?)

2308
01:26:40,634 --> 01:26:42,374
(It's red.)

2309
01:26:43,604 --> 01:26:46,974
(A few seconds before the time is up)

2310
01:26:47,004 --> 01:26:49,374
(Jae Seok chases after her to change their caps.)

2311
01:26:49,374 --> 01:26:50,374
I must catch her.

2312
01:26:50,374 --> 01:26:54,474
The race is over.

2313
01:26:54,474 --> 01:26:57,474
(The race finished before he could switch the caps.)

2314
01:26:58,804 --> 01:27:01,074
(The only Dud Man on Team Blue succeeds.)

2315
01:27:01,074 --> 01:27:04,134
It's me. I'm the hero today.

2316
01:27:04,474 --> 01:27:05,474
Goodness.

2317
01:27:05,474 --> 01:27:08,104
(Haha, So Min, and Seok Jin are Dud Men.)

2318
01:27:08,104 --> 01:27:10,804
The race was exactly for 30 minutes.

2319
01:27:10,804 --> 01:27:12,574
- I thought so. - As you can see,

2320
01:27:12,574 --> 01:27:15,004
there are two Dud Men on Team Red.

2321
01:27:15,004 --> 01:27:16,704
The winning team is Team Blue.

2322
01:27:16,704 --> 01:27:19,404
(Team Blue wins.)

2323
01:27:19,404 --> 01:27:21,174
- I knew it. - Seriously.

2324
01:27:21,334 --> 01:27:23,834
These two members are impressive.

2325
01:27:23,834 --> 01:27:25,904
They're always exempted from being punished.

2326
01:27:25,904 --> 01:27:26,904
I wanted to go.

2327
01:27:26,904 --> 01:27:28,974
They're good after all.

2328
01:27:28,974 --> 01:27:30,434
I really wanted to go.

2329
01:27:31,004 --> 01:27:32,874
It's not over yet.

2330
01:27:33,834 --> 01:27:34,834
It's not?

2331
01:27:34,834 --> 01:27:36,204
(It's not over yet?)

2332
01:27:36,204 --> 01:27:38,304
We have two Dud Men.

2333
01:27:38,304 --> 01:27:41,434
(There are two Dud Men on Team Red.)

2334
01:27:41,434 --> 01:27:45,274
You'll be sent to two different places of our choice.

2335
01:27:45,274 --> 01:27:49,504
(Haha and So Min will choose where they go.)

2336
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:51,534
("People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent")

2337
01:27:51,974 --> 01:27:53,534
It's called Catacombs of Paris.

2338
01:27:53,534 --> 01:27:56,574
(Catacombs of Paris, France)

2339
01:27:56,574 --> 01:28:00,374
(Giant Canyon Swing, United States)

2340
01:28:00,374 --> 01:28:04,374
(Copper Canyon Ziprider, Mexico)

2341
01:28:04,374 --> 01:28:08,474
(Manual Wooden Cable Car, Indonesia)

2342
01:28:08,474 --> 01:28:12,434
(Hammocking, Java, Indonesia)

2343
01:28:12,434 --> 01:28:17,574
(Crater of Diamonds State Park, United States)

2344
01:28:18,004 --> 01:28:20,574
(Where will they go out of these 6 places?)

2345
01:28:23,804 --> 01:28:25,304
Haha.

2346
01:28:25,304 --> 01:28:27,104
- I'll spin it. - Please go first.

2347
01:28:27,104 --> 01:28:28,634
(Haha is very nervous.)

2348
01:28:28,634 --> 01:28:30,304
Where do you want to go?

2349
01:28:30,304 --> 01:28:31,574
I want to go here.

2350
01:28:31,574 --> 01:28:32,704
Diamonds State Park?

2351
01:28:32,704 --> 01:28:34,374
I think this is the worst.

2352
01:28:34,374 --> 01:28:36,004
(The worst is Copper Canyon.)

2353
01:28:36,004 --> 01:28:37,204
This is the worst.

2354
01:28:38,274 --> 01:28:41,074
(The best and the worst are next to each other.)

2355
01:28:41,204 --> 01:28:42,474
Let's go for the diamond.

2356
01:28:42,474 --> 01:28:45,434
(He spins for Crater of Diamonds State Park.)

2357
01:28:46,734 --> 01:28:48,604
(Where will...)

2358
01:28:48,604 --> 01:28:52,534
(the pointer stop after Haha spins it?)

2359
01:28:53,304 --> 01:28:54,304
Please.

2360
01:28:54,304 --> 01:28:58,574
(Please help me.)

2361
01:28:58,574 --> 01:29:03,604
(He has 1 out of 6 chance to get Diamonds State Park.)

2362
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:05,204
It's Crater of Diamonds State Park.

2363
01:29:05,204 --> 01:29:09,534
(It's Crater of Diamonds State Park.)

2364
01:29:11,104 --> 01:29:14,504
(It keeps moving.)

2365
01:29:14,504 --> 01:29:15,804
It's Giant Canyon Swing.

2366
01:29:15,804 --> 01:29:17,574
(He's selected for Giant Canyon Swing.)

2367
01:29:18,474 --> 01:29:19,474
What's that?

2368
01:29:21,334 --> 01:29:23,904
(It's the legendary swing.)

2369
01:29:23,904 --> 01:29:27,274
(This is Giant Canyon Swing.)

2370
01:29:27,804 --> 01:29:30,674
Haha can't even ride the Vikings.

2371
01:29:30,904 --> 01:29:32,574
Giant Canyon Swing?

2372
01:29:32,574 --> 01:29:34,204
I was hoping he wouldn't get it.

2373
01:29:35,404 --> 01:29:37,004
- I don't know anymore. - I think...

2374
01:29:37,004 --> 01:29:38,804
- I don't know either. - he should do what he wants.

2375
01:29:39,834 --> 01:29:42,434
I bet I'll get something dangerous.

2376
01:29:42,434 --> 01:29:43,874
- Give it a try. - Go ahead.

2377
01:29:44,434 --> 01:29:46,174
(Spinning)

2378
01:29:46,804 --> 01:29:48,204
- Give it a try. - Go ahead.

2379
01:29:49,404 --> 01:29:50,574
Where do you want to go?

2380
01:29:50,574 --> 01:29:51,604
I want to go to Diamonds Park.

2381
01:29:51,604 --> 01:29:52,604
Where do you not want to go?

2382
01:29:52,734 --> 01:29:54,504
I don't want anything scary.

2383
01:29:56,404 --> 01:29:59,374
(So Min wants to go to Crater of Diamonds State Park.)

2384
01:29:59,374 --> 01:30:07,204
(Will her wish come true?)

2385
01:30:07,641 --> 01:30:09,641
Manual Wooden Cable Car?

2386
01:30:09,641 --> 01:30:10,911
(Laughing)

2387
01:30:10,911 --> 01:30:12,171
It's manual.

2388
01:30:12,271 --> 01:30:13,271
Manual Wooden Cable Car?

2389
01:30:13,271 --> 01:30:17,111
(She gets selected for Manual Wooden Cable Car.)

2390
01:30:17,111 --> 01:30:18,441
It's Manual Wooden Cable Car.

2391
01:30:18,441 --> 01:30:19,441
(She gets selected for Manual Wooden Cable Car.)

2392
01:30:20,941 --> 01:30:23,671
I think this is the end.

2393
01:30:23,711 --> 01:30:26,341
I'm leaving Running Man today.

2394
01:30:26,811 --> 01:30:28,841
Even if you leave, you must go there first.

2395
01:30:29,241 --> 01:30:31,571
I can't go there. How can I?

2396
01:30:32,841 --> 01:30:35,071
(You must fight against the current.)

2397
01:30:35,071 --> 01:30:38,541
(Manual Wooden Cable Car, Indonesia.)

2398
01:30:41,941 --> 01:30:45,941
It's time to choose a partner.

2399
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:47,841
Get ready.

2400
01:30:47,841 --> 01:30:49,311
(They will go with the Dud Man whom they select.)

2401
01:30:49,311 --> 01:30:50,341
You'll be fine.

2402
01:30:54,011 --> 01:30:55,371
I picked it first.

2403
01:30:55,371 --> 01:30:56,641
I want this one.

2404
01:30:56,641 --> 01:30:57,941
I want it too.

2405
01:30:57,941 --> 01:30:59,941
- Let me have it. - Here they go again.

2406
01:30:59,941 --> 01:31:01,411
They're going to make a fuss again.

2407
01:31:01,541 --> 01:31:02,541
Shall I just do it?

2408
01:31:03,241 --> 01:31:04,241
- I don't know. - Never mind.

2409
01:31:04,241 --> 01:31:06,241
No, I choose that one.

2410
01:31:06,241 --> 01:31:07,711
I already picked it.

2411
01:31:07,711 --> 01:31:09,211
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2412
01:31:09,211 --> 01:31:10,571
Rock-paper-scissors. Okay.

2413
01:31:10,571 --> 01:31:12,711
(It's difficult to let go, but they finish picking their partners.)

2414
01:31:13,371 --> 01:31:14,411
Now,

2415
01:31:14,741 --> 01:31:16,711
show us the names in the count of three.

2416
01:31:17,071 --> 01:31:18,111
One.

2417
01:31:18,711 --> 01:31:19,711
Two.

2418
01:31:19,711 --> 01:31:23,111
(Which partner did they pick?)

2419
01:31:23,111 --> 01:31:24,111
Three.

2420
01:31:24,111 --> 01:31:29,471
(Their partners are revealed.)

2421
01:31:29,471 --> 01:31:31,471
(Kwang Soo picks So Min.)

2422
01:31:31,471 --> 01:31:33,141
It'll be noisy when we go together.

2423
01:31:33,141 --> 01:31:35,241
(Kwang Soo and So Min are sent to Wooden Cable Car.)

2424
01:31:37,341 --> 01:31:40,111
(Haha and Se Chan are sent to Giant Canyon Swing.)

2425
01:31:40,441 --> 01:31:43,441
There will be romance that nobody cares about.

2426
01:31:43,441 --> 01:31:45,541
We'll see it again.

2427
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:46,941
Nobody will care.

2428
01:31:47,441 --> 01:31:50,171
Those who will be punished on...

2429
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:51,511
People's Recommendation Project...

2430
01:31:51,741 --> 01:31:54,711
are Haha, Se Chan, So Min, and Kwang Soo.

2431
01:31:54,841 --> 01:31:58,371
We need more than one month to request visas for our shoot.

2432
01:31:58,371 --> 01:32:00,941
We'll leave as soon as we're ready.

2433
01:32:00,941 --> 01:32:03,941
Are we going with the viewer who recommended the place?

2434
01:32:04,841 --> 01:32:07,471
We'll send the viewers gifts.

2435
01:32:07,471 --> 01:32:08,641
- They won't go with you. - Why?

2436
01:32:08,641 --> 01:32:09,641
They should go with them.

2437
01:32:09,711 --> 01:32:11,541
Shouldn't we go with them?

2438
01:32:12,241 --> 01:32:14,211
If they're not coming, tell us their IDs.

2439
01:32:15,141 --> 01:32:16,271
- Please. - Give us their IP address.

2440
01:32:16,271 --> 01:32:17,311
Give us their IP address.

2441
01:32:17,311 --> 01:32:19,441
(Running Man is always on the viewers' side.)

2442
01:32:20,011 --> 01:32:21,841
(7th anniversary of Running Man)

2443
01:32:21,841 --> 01:32:23,711
(Special people are coming.)

2444
01:32:24,111 --> 01:32:26,111
(Their family is here.)

2445
01:32:26,641 --> 01:32:28,041
(What are his drinking habits?)

2446
01:32:28,041 --> 01:32:29,141
(He becomes a mess.)

2447
01:32:29,141 --> 01:32:30,911
(They're more vicious than Running Man members.)

2448
01:32:31,111 --> 01:32:32,141
(He's not good at anything.)

2449
01:32:32,141 --> 01:32:34,811
(They're funnier than them.)

2450
01:32:34,811 --> 01:32:36,111
(Cho Sae Ho)

2451
01:32:36,111 --> 01:32:37,641
(Kim Soo Yong)

2452
01:32:37,641 --> 01:32:39,441
(Son Na Eun)

2453
01:32:39,441 --> 01:32:41,141
(Tae Hang Ho)

2454
01:32:41,141 --> 01:32:43,011
(Real family members are coming.)

2455
01:32:43,741 --> 01:32:44,741
