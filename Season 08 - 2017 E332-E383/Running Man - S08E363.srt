1
00:00:07,582 --> 00:00:09,512
The weather is amazing today.

2
00:00:09,512 --> 00:00:11,212
I'm sweating immediately.

3
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,782
It's either rain or hot weather.

4
00:00:12,782 --> 00:00:13,782
- Because it's summer. - It's so hot.

5
00:00:13,782 --> 00:00:15,692
- Today... - Luckily, it's not humid.

6
00:00:15,692 --> 00:00:17,352
- Look at the sky. - It's so hot.

7
00:00:17,652 --> 00:00:19,822
Today's race is the Summer Vacation Special,

8
00:00:19,822 --> 00:00:21,492
and it's called Partner Race at Running High School.

9
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,162
- Running High School? - Partner?

10
00:00:24,162 --> 00:00:26,432
- We took a gap year. - It's like Benjamin Button.

11
00:00:26,432 --> 00:00:27,532
- Traveling back in time. - We took a gap year.

12
00:00:27,532 --> 00:00:29,672
Since it's Partner Race, you need to partner up with someone.

13
00:00:29,672 --> 00:00:31,332
- Sure. - Please come in.

14
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:32,442
Right away?

15
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:34,272
Where are they coming from?

16
00:00:34,942 --> 00:00:37,142
(The music sounds familiar.)

17
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:39,142
What?

18
00:00:39,142 --> 00:00:40,442
(Could their partners be...)

19
00:00:41,512 --> 00:00:44,682
(They are hotter than this hot summer.)

20
00:00:45,152 --> 00:00:47,722
(They're joining today's race as the members' partners.)

21
00:00:47,722 --> 00:00:50,092
- It's Girls' Generation. - Girls' Generation!

22
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:52,192
- My goodness! - Girls' Generation!

23
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,392
(They're happy to see them.)

24
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:56,492
Girls' Generation!

25
00:00:57,462 --> 00:00:59,562
- Welcome! - Goodness!

26
00:00:59,562 --> 00:01:00,802
How long has it been?

27
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,572
My goodness.

28
00:01:02,872 --> 00:01:07,142
(They're back on Running Man after 2 years.)

29
00:01:07,142 --> 00:01:09,172
- Right, this was it. - They still remember the dance.

30
00:01:09,342 --> 00:01:10,612
They haven't forgotten about it.

31
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,682
("Into the New World" by Girls' Generation)

32
00:01:11,682 --> 00:01:12,782
Goodness.

33
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:14,142
("Into the New World" by Girls' Generation)

34
00:01:16,982 --> 00:01:18,752
I remember those dance moves.

35
00:01:19,182 --> 00:01:20,682
(It's their debut song that portrays their youthful charms 10 years ago.)

36
00:01:20,682 --> 00:01:21,692
Great.

37
00:01:21,692 --> 00:01:22,692
(It's their debut song that portrays their youthful charms 10 years ago.)

38
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:24,722
It was like an oasis during my military life!

39
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:27,322
Let's go!

40
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,392
Is it "Gee" this time?

41
00:01:30,392 --> 00:01:32,062
(The entire country knows this song.)

42
00:01:32,632 --> 00:01:36,772
- No, no, no, no, no - No, no, no, no, no

43
00:01:41,272 --> 00:01:43,472
(They're releasing all their stress.)

44
00:01:44,442 --> 00:01:48,182
- My body shakes, gee - My body shakes, gee

45
00:01:48,182 --> 00:01:50,052
(Shouting with all his might)

46
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:53,152
- Oh, yes - Oh, yes

47
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:57,092
(You can't help but fall straight into their charms.)

48
00:01:59,022 --> 00:02:01,222
(I love it!)

49
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:04,462
(Girls' Generation has returned to Running Man after 2 years.)

50
00:02:04,462 --> 00:02:05,902
- They're still pretty. - Goodness.

51
00:02:07,702 --> 00:02:08,872
Girls' Generation!

52
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:09,872
(He's going crazy to see them.)

53
00:02:10,972 --> 00:02:12,602
It's awesome.

54
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:14,402
- It's so exciting. - Hi, guys.

55
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:15,812
- So exciting. - I know.

56
00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:17,912
- I love it. - All your songs...

57
00:02:17,912 --> 00:02:20,082
- became incredibly famous. - We were crazy about their songs.

58
00:02:20,382 --> 00:02:21,982
They're all just so good.

59
00:02:21,982 --> 00:02:23,782
They didn't show us "Gee" though.

60
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:24,782
(Come to think of it...)

61
00:02:25,052 --> 00:02:26,782
(He wonders why they didn't perform "Gee".)

62
00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:27,982
They just showed us that song.

63
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,392
- It was the second song. - Did they?

64
00:02:29,392 --> 00:02:31,392
- They performed "Gee". - We did it.

65
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:34,422
- It was the second song. - What's wrong with you?

66
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:35,762
They did it.

67
00:02:35,762 --> 00:02:36,762
(Embarrassed)

68
00:02:36,762 --> 00:02:38,332
- I can't believe you said that. - Sorry.

69
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,432
This is wonderful news. It's finally...

70
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:45,072
their 10th year anniversary since their debut.

71
00:02:45,072 --> 00:02:46,602
(Congratulations!)

72
00:02:46,602 --> 00:02:48,772
You should all be aware of...

73
00:02:48,772 --> 00:02:49,872
how great this means.

74
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:51,942
They debuted when they were high school students.

75
00:02:51,942 --> 00:02:53,682
They were so young when they first made their debut.

76
00:02:53,682 --> 00:02:56,782
Now, they're showing their amazing talents in many kinds of fields.

77
00:02:56,782 --> 00:02:59,522
- I know. - Right.

78
00:02:59,522 --> 00:03:01,692
Yu Ri is still panting.

79
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:03,422
(Her body is different from 10 years ago.)

80
00:03:05,092 --> 00:03:06,592
- Come on. - Why don't you go wash your face?

81
00:03:06,592 --> 00:03:07,922
- I mean... - You're being too mean...

82
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:09,592
when I'm here after a long time.

83
00:03:09,592 --> 00:03:11,532
- Are you tired? - Yu Ri is the only one...

84
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:13,032
- who seems very exhausted. - Goodness.

85
00:03:13,032 --> 00:03:16,572
Whenever I see Yu Ri, I'm reminded of Trick Yu Ri,

86
00:03:16,672 --> 00:03:18,502
- the segment we did long ago. - Right.

87
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:19,572
- Oh, right. - The questions.

88
00:03:19,572 --> 00:03:21,042
Right, I remember too. The quiz.

89
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:22,372
- Right. - The quiz.

90
00:03:22,372 --> 00:03:24,172
She made Kwang Soo's heart flutter then.

91
00:03:24,172 --> 00:03:25,982
- She was the first one to do so. - There was something between us.

92
00:03:25,982 --> 00:03:27,212
It was Yu Ri.

93
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:30,312
(During Trick Yu Ri 7 years ago)

94
00:03:30,312 --> 00:03:32,552
(He's shy.)

95
00:03:33,452 --> 00:03:34,682
(His face turned red.)

96
00:03:34,722 --> 00:03:35,952
I've never seen him this way.

97
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:37,522
Do you love her? Is your heart beating quickly?

98
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:40,692
(I'm glad that I joined this program.)

99
00:03:41,862 --> 00:03:44,492
(What is happening? Are we in a romantic relationship now?)

100
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:46,032
(I'm envious.)

101
00:03:47,032 --> 00:03:51,572
(Yu Ri became the first woman to make his heart flutter in the show.)

102
00:03:52,342 --> 00:03:54,872
She definitely made his heart flutter back then.

103
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:56,672
We were a thing.

104
00:03:57,372 --> 00:04:00,612
I remember now. You're doing this program for quite a long time.

105
00:04:00,612 --> 00:04:03,412
(She treats him like an outdated celebrity.)

106
00:04:03,412 --> 00:04:04,782
- What do you mean? - I mean...

107
00:04:05,182 --> 00:04:06,482
Yes, I'm still alive.

108
00:04:07,152 --> 00:04:08,182
What are you talking about?

109
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:10,422
- Kwang Soo is alive. - Goodness.

110
00:04:10,422 --> 00:04:11,992
- It's so funny. - Seriously.

111
00:04:12,192 --> 00:04:13,362
- He falls in love quickly. - Right.

112
00:04:13,362 --> 00:04:14,362
He never dies.

113
00:04:14,362 --> 00:04:18,462
Please introduce yourselves to the viewers one by one.

114
00:04:19,232 --> 00:04:21,872
Hello, viewers of Running Man.

115
00:04:21,872 --> 00:04:24,632
I'm Tiffany who's shinier than jewelry.

116
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:26,342
- Tiffany. - Good.

117
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:27,902
(She introduces herself like a rookie.)

118
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:30,242
(She's become much cuter than before.)

119
00:04:30,242 --> 00:04:31,412
- Good. - You became so cute.

120
00:04:31,412 --> 00:04:33,482
- She's still motivated. - Good.

121
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:37,882
- Next up is Hyo Yeon. - Like when you were a rookie.

122
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:39,152
- All of a sudden? - Hyo Yeon.

123
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:42,192
Hello, I'm the dancing queen, Hyo Yeon.

124
00:04:43,192 --> 00:04:45,092
- Should I do this? - Do it all the way through.

125
00:04:45,092 --> 00:04:46,392
- Goodness. - Dancing queen.

126
00:04:46,392 --> 00:04:48,462
I'm sorry, but I guess you don't remember how you did it.

127
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:49,492
- Pardon? - How you did it.

128
00:04:49,492 --> 00:04:51,262
- Do you not remember? - Was that your nickname?

129
00:04:51,262 --> 00:04:52,402
I'm not sure.

130
00:04:52,402 --> 00:04:53,432
(Silly)

131
00:04:53,932 --> 00:04:54,972
I'm not sure.

132
00:04:55,572 --> 00:04:57,272
- The dance... - What are you doing?

133
00:04:57,272 --> 00:04:58,602
- What was it? - Wasn't it a dancing machine?

134
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:00,402
- Dancing machine? - That's right.

135
00:05:00,402 --> 00:05:02,772
- Dancing machine... - Didn't you do like this?

136
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:04,442
They say I was a dancing machine.

137
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:05,882
I see, dancing machine.

138
00:05:05,882 --> 00:05:07,242
- Right. - Please do it again then.

139
00:05:07,242 --> 00:05:08,882
I'm the dancing machine, Hyo Yeon.

140
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:13,252
- Goodness. - Like a machine. I see.

141
00:05:13,282 --> 00:05:15,652
Next up is Soo Young.

142
00:05:16,152 --> 00:05:20,022
Hello, I'm the bright princess of Girls' Generation, Soo Young!

143
00:05:20,022 --> 00:05:22,362
- Right, she was the princess. - Princess Myeongnyang?

144
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:23,532
(He heard it wrong.)

145
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,562
- Was it your nickname? - Yes.

146
00:05:25,562 --> 00:05:27,432
We were all princesses with particular talents.

147
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:29,172
- Really? - Why was I the machine then?

148
00:05:29,172 --> 00:05:31,942
I don't know why her nickname was the machine.

149
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:34,942
- She was the only one? - Yes.

150
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:36,672
All right. Yu Ri, please go ahead.

151
00:05:36,672 --> 00:05:39,382
Hello, I'm the black pearl of Girls' Generation, Yu Ri.

152
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:41,082
- Black pearl. - Right.

153
00:05:41,082 --> 00:05:43,382
- Because of your skin. - Following Lee Bon.

154
00:05:43,712 --> 00:05:46,282
Hello, I'm the tiny leader, Tae Yeon.

155
00:05:47,652 --> 00:05:49,592
- So cute! - Tae Yeon.

156
00:05:49,592 --> 00:05:52,892
Hello, I'm the charming girl of Girls' Generation, Yoon A.

157
00:05:52,892 --> 00:05:54,492
The charming girl.

158
00:05:54,492 --> 00:05:55,932
- Charming girl. - Charming girl.

159
00:05:55,932 --> 00:05:57,692
It's not easy to call oneself charming.

160
00:05:58,302 --> 00:06:02,672
Seo Hyun couldn't make it because of her drama schedule.

161
00:06:02,672 --> 00:06:05,442
- But Yoon A also... - Don't you have to film your drama?

162
00:06:05,572 --> 00:06:07,972
We already finished filming the drama before its broadcast.

163
00:06:08,342 --> 00:06:09,372
I see.

164
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:10,712
When will it start?

165
00:06:10,712 --> 00:06:13,042
- It's being broadcast now. - It already started.

166
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:14,812
(It's being broadcast, so please stay quiet.)

167
00:06:15,082 --> 00:06:17,112
Whisper to me before acting so stupidly.

168
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:19,182
- Okay. - Goodness.

169
00:06:19,182 --> 00:06:20,982
- I understand your intention. - Come on.

170
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:22,792
Please don't upset our guests.

171
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:24,922
- Please don't. - I'm so embarrassed.

172
00:06:25,462 --> 00:06:26,562
(Seok Jin's still the same as before.)

173
00:06:27,322 --> 00:06:29,792
Following Yoon A,

174
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:34,262
- next is Sunny's turn. - Sunny!

175
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:36,272
(It's Soon Gyu's turn.)

176
00:06:36,802 --> 00:06:37,972
(Hesitant)

177
00:06:38,072 --> 00:06:40,872
Hello, I'm the energizer of Girls' Generation, Sunny.

178
00:06:41,972 --> 00:06:43,672
Her gestures are still there.

179
00:06:43,672 --> 00:06:45,282
- I'm sorry. - "Sunny."

180
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:47,782
I think she's the best in appealing her charms.

181
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,812
She always makes a huge impression even if her part is very small.

182
00:06:50,812 --> 00:06:52,182
She gives a huge impact.

183
00:06:52,182 --> 00:06:53,582
- Right. - She's impressive.

184
00:06:53,582 --> 00:06:55,792
Actually, rather than appealing myself in my part,

185
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:58,992
I mostly do it behind others when they're doing their parts.

186
00:06:59,662 --> 00:07:02,032
(They totally agree with it.)

187
00:07:02,032 --> 00:07:03,032
That's selfish.

188
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:04,662
- Show us. - Show us an example.

189
00:07:04,662 --> 00:07:06,732
Have you been surprised to watch one of your music videos?

190
00:07:06,762 --> 00:07:08,032
Behind us, she goes...

191
00:07:08,232 --> 00:07:09,802
Right, I know what she's talking about.

192
00:07:09,802 --> 00:07:11,232
She does something like this.

193
00:07:11,232 --> 00:07:13,572
- Right, she winks a lot. - Show us a little bit of it.

194
00:07:13,572 --> 00:07:15,142
Please show us a bit.

195
00:07:15,772 --> 00:07:19,782
- Let's say it's Yoon A's part. - The part we saw earlier.

196
00:07:20,742 --> 00:07:23,382
Don't laugh because I am embarrassed

197
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:26,382
Don't tease because I am serious

198
00:07:27,252 --> 00:07:33,062
(She catches everyone's attention.)

199
00:07:33,622 --> 00:07:37,162
(It looks like Sunny's part.)

200
00:07:38,262 --> 00:07:39,432
I thought it was Sunny's part.

201
00:07:39,802 --> 00:07:41,262
I only had eyes for Sunny.

202
00:07:41,362 --> 00:07:42,432
- Didn't you look at me? - No, I didn't.

203
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:43,572
(Yoon A is disappointed.)

204
00:07:43,572 --> 00:07:45,002
I didn't see Yoon A once.

205
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:47,102
How did she do that in such a short period of time?

206
00:07:47,142 --> 00:07:48,342
She is fresh.

207
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:50,142
She is like a vacuum cleaner of attention.

208
00:07:50,142 --> 00:07:52,782
- She is ready for the camera. - I know. She is amazing.

209
00:07:52,782 --> 00:07:54,342
- She works hard. - That's right.

210
00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:57,852
Today, you will have Partner Race with Girls' Generation.

211
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:01,082
My Girls' Generation, My Bad Girls' Generation.

212
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:03,352
(Girls' Generation...)

213
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:08,832
(and Bad Girls' Generation?)

214
00:08:08,992 --> 00:08:10,492
What is that?

215
00:08:10,632 --> 00:08:12,662
Since there are six male members,

216
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:14,832
there will be six teams that are comprised of a man and a woman.

217
00:08:15,402 --> 00:08:17,302
Three women without partners...

218
00:08:17,302 --> 00:08:20,302
will make up Team Singles.

219
00:08:20,472 --> 00:08:26,312
(6 men make 6 teams, and 3 women make Team Singles.)

220
00:08:26,312 --> 00:08:28,142
That means we will be partnered with a woman no matter what.

221
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:30,682
I can't believe we got this opportunity.

222
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:32,982
We will be partnered with a woman no matter what.

223
00:08:33,482 --> 00:08:34,722
Among the female members...

224
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,452
are three bad girls who break up couples.

225
00:08:37,452 --> 00:08:40,492
(Among the 9 female members are 3 bad girls.)

226
00:08:40,762 --> 00:08:44,292
(The men need to beware of the 3 bad girls during the race.)

227
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:45,662
I want to be in a team with the female members.

228
00:08:45,732 --> 00:08:47,762
The team that wins in a mission...

229
00:08:47,762 --> 00:08:51,072
will be given a hint about the bad girls and an exchange card.

230
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:53,842
After the final race,

231
00:08:53,842 --> 00:08:56,212
Team Partners wins if they find two or more bad girls.

232
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:58,842
Team Bad Girls win if they don't.

233
00:08:58,842 --> 00:09:00,812
The losing team will receive an ice shower.

234
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:03,252
- Ice shower? - In short,

235
00:09:03,582 --> 00:09:05,322
- we need to find the bad girls. - That's right.

236
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:07,222
Three bad girls are hiding among you.

237
00:09:07,222 --> 00:09:08,622
- This is like "X-Man". - Already?

238
00:09:08,622 --> 00:09:11,222
(3 bad girls with a mission are hiding among the female members.)

239
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,722
- They are already among us. - We have three bad girls.

240
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:15,662
They received a mission.

241
00:09:15,662 --> 00:09:17,362
- They received a mission. - Sunny seems to be a bad girl.

242
00:09:17,492 --> 00:09:19,532
We must watch carefully when we play games.

243
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:23,172
Even if the men succeed in apprehending the bad girls,

244
00:09:23,172 --> 00:09:26,102
they will receive the penalty if their partners are bad girls.

245
00:09:26,102 --> 00:09:29,412
Please be careful in choosing and exchanging partners.

246
00:09:29,742 --> 00:09:32,242
(Partner up with a trustworthy girl and avoid the bad ones.)

247
00:09:32,242 --> 00:09:33,812
We might have to exchange partners.

248
00:09:33,812 --> 00:09:35,452
(Partner up with a trustworthy girl and avoid the bad ones.)

249
00:09:36,112 --> 00:09:37,412
Since heatwave alert has been issued,

250
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:39,952
we will start the race inside the school.

251
00:09:39,952 --> 00:09:41,922
- Let's go. - Go, go.

252
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:44,152
(Partner Race starts inside the school building.)

253
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:48,562
We are inside the school to avoid the heatwave.

254
00:09:48,562 --> 00:09:49,862
- All right. - Yes.

255
00:09:49,862 --> 00:09:51,192
(They are glad to enter the air-conditioned classroom.)

256
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:52,962
- Thank you. - This is nice.

257
00:09:52,962 --> 00:09:54,062
Beware of heatwave.

258
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:55,072
(He is the honorary ambassador of health.)

259
00:09:56,002 --> 00:09:58,702
We will now have a mission to decide on the partners.

260
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:00,272
The title of the mission is...

261
00:10:00,272 --> 00:10:02,372
Tell Me Your Wish.

262
00:10:02,372 --> 00:10:04,412
(Tell Me Your Wish)

263
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:06,642
- Tell me your wish - Tell me your wish

264
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:12,552
Six male members will give a keyword for the partner of their wish.

265
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:15,322
Then the female members will compete against each other.

266
00:10:17,822 --> 00:10:20,122
(The female members must compete against each other.)

267
00:10:20,122 --> 00:10:21,892
The winner will get to be the partner.

268
00:10:21,892 --> 00:10:25,802
There will be a fierce competition.

269
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:27,702
They must compete for us.

270
00:10:27,702 --> 00:10:29,372
It will be ruthless.

271
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:31,942
(I want to be a member of Team Singles.)

272
00:10:31,942 --> 00:10:34,072
- You must be thinking... - We just need to choose.

273
00:10:34,072 --> 00:10:35,372
We just need to choose.

274
00:10:35,372 --> 00:10:37,042
"Why do I need to do that..."

275
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:39,542
"when I am back after a two-year break?"

276
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,882
- However, it can't be helped. - Someone will be my partner.

277
00:10:42,882 --> 00:10:44,452
Someone will be my partner.

278
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:46,222
- Okay. - Get excited.

279
00:10:46,222 --> 00:10:48,252
- Be prepared. - They need to be prepared.

280
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:50,092
(They have chills down their spines.)

281
00:10:50,722 --> 00:10:53,322
Seok Jin, please present a keyword for your partner.

282
00:10:53,322 --> 00:10:54,422
- Should I go first? - Yes.

283
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:55,562
(Haughty)

284
00:10:55,562 --> 00:10:56,592
- Should I go first? - Yes.

285
00:11:02,402 --> 00:11:05,472
- Look at them. - Whoever...

286
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:06,842
Look at them.

287
00:11:07,002 --> 00:11:09,112
- I can feel the atmosphere. - Hey.

288
00:11:09,112 --> 00:11:11,512
I thought I was at the North Pole.

289
00:11:11,512 --> 00:11:13,712
- Why did it become so cold? - They turned ice cold.

290
00:11:13,712 --> 00:11:14,952
- What is up with the atmosphere? - Don't ignore me.

291
00:11:14,952 --> 00:11:16,082
They turned cold.

292
00:11:16,752 --> 00:11:19,222
Let me give you a tip.

293
00:11:19,222 --> 00:11:22,252
I will consider partnering up with the one who meets my eyes.

294
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:29,692
I will consider partnering up with the one who meets my eyes.

295
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:31,832
Hey.

296
00:11:32,002 --> 00:11:33,562
You...

297
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:35,202
(Why are you looking away?)

298
00:11:35,202 --> 00:11:36,702
For goodness' sake.

299
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:39,872
This is incredible.

300
00:11:39,872 --> 00:11:41,972
He is like Medusa.

301
00:11:41,972 --> 00:11:44,912
They don't want to meet Medusa's eyes.

302
00:11:45,712 --> 00:11:47,342
Seok Jin is Medusa.

303
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:48,652
Okay.

304
00:11:48,652 --> 00:11:51,382
Accept the reality. There are fewer men than women.

305
00:11:51,382 --> 00:11:53,452
- Think of it as an honor. - Seok Jin.

306
00:11:53,452 --> 00:11:55,652
You don't have to pretend to be okay.

307
00:11:55,952 --> 00:11:58,362
Your face turned red.

308
00:11:58,362 --> 00:11:59,822
To be honest, my heart is wounded.

309
00:12:00,062 --> 00:12:01,192
W.H.

310
00:12:02,092 --> 00:12:03,292
W.H.

311
00:12:03,662 --> 00:12:05,032
Do you know what W.H. is?

312
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:06,602
- A wounded heart. - That's right.

313
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:09,972
They are the new generation.

314
00:12:09,972 --> 00:12:11,532
Don't look this way.

315
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:13,472
- "They are the new generation." - The new generation?

316
00:12:13,472 --> 00:12:14,942
- They are the new generation. - W.H. is old.

317
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,542
You know that W.H. stands for a wounded heart.

318
00:12:16,972 --> 00:12:18,782
- Don't be ridiculous. - My goodness.

319
00:12:18,782 --> 00:12:20,012
(The girls of the new generation are shocked.)

320
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:21,982
I like rock, paper, scissors.

321
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:25,322
I will choose the one who comes first...

322
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:27,552
in a game of rock, paper, scissors.

323
00:12:27,552 --> 00:12:30,352
(The one who comes first in a game of rock, paper, scissors)

324
00:12:30,352 --> 00:12:31,992
What?

325
00:12:31,992 --> 00:12:33,092
- What? - The winner will be my partner.

326
00:12:33,092 --> 00:12:34,422
The winner will be my partner.

327
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:36,232
You have to participate in a game of rock, paper, scissors.

328
00:12:36,232 --> 00:12:37,832
Does that mean I have to lose?

329
00:12:37,832 --> 00:12:39,332
- You have to lose. - Right.

330
00:12:39,432 --> 00:12:41,702
- You have to lose. - You have to lose.

331
00:12:41,872 --> 00:12:43,972
- You are good at it. - No.

332
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,002
Yu Ri is good at it.

333
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:47,302
I think...

334
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:49,842
Sunny will be my partner. I think Sunny will win.

335
00:12:49,842 --> 00:12:52,842
(He thinks Sunny will be his partner.)

336
00:12:52,842 --> 00:12:54,742
- Sunny, Sunny! - Sunny, Sunny!

337
00:12:54,742 --> 00:12:57,512
- Sunny, Sunny! - Sunny.

338
00:12:57,512 --> 00:12:59,022
(He is flustered.)

339
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:01,222
You don't have to pretend to be okay.

340
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:03,092
(Stop it.)

341
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:04,392
- Seok Jin. - My heart is wounded.

342
00:13:04,652 --> 00:13:05,992
(The shoot almost gets stopped.)

343
00:13:05,992 --> 00:13:07,322
- He might collapse. - I am smiling...

344
00:13:07,322 --> 00:13:08,662
for the shoot.

345
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,732
Look at their facial expressions.

346
00:13:10,732 --> 00:13:12,802
I remember the dance.

347
00:13:13,302 --> 00:13:16,302
The first round is between Yu Ri and Hyo Yeon.

348
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:17,732
(Hyo Yeon versus Yu Ri)

349
00:13:17,732 --> 00:13:19,902
This is the tournament of death.

350
00:13:19,902 --> 00:13:21,442
- The tournament of death. - Please step forward.

351
00:13:21,442 --> 00:13:22,572
The unlucky one will win.

352
00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:24,272
- This is a death match. - The unlucky one will win.

353
00:13:24,272 --> 00:13:25,712
This is a death match.

354
00:13:26,582 --> 00:13:28,752
You only get one chance.

355
00:13:29,052 --> 00:13:30,512
- In 1, 2, 3. - I hope I don't win.

356
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:31,852
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

357
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,952
(The winner takes one step towards Seok Jin.)

358
00:13:35,152 --> 00:13:36,392
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

359
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:39,292
(Yu Ri wins.)

360
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:42,062
(Happy versus sad)

361
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:43,092
That surprised me.

362
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:47,562
She hates the fact that she won.

363
00:13:47,562 --> 00:13:49,232
I haven't seen anyone become that sad after a victory.

364
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:50,902
She hates the fact that she won.

365
00:13:51,132 --> 00:13:52,172
I don't know what to do.

366
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:53,402
How unfortunate!

367
00:13:53,742 --> 00:13:56,642
The next round is between Soo Young and Yoon A.

368
00:13:56,872 --> 00:13:58,482
Why am I so nervous?

369
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:02,312
(It's a fierce match between the tall rivals.)

370
00:14:02,312 --> 00:14:03,452
Why am I so nervous?

371
00:14:03,452 --> 00:14:04,582
(Seok Jin is even more nervous.)

372
00:14:04,882 --> 00:14:06,052
Let's play rock, paper, scissors.

373
00:14:06,052 --> 00:14:07,222
Rock, paper, scissors.

374
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,552
(Yoon A wins.)

375
00:14:09,552 --> 00:14:11,962
(Screaming)

376
00:14:11,962 --> 00:14:14,062
(Their screams have different meanings.)

377
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,392
Yes!

378
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:16,892
She is so upset.

379
00:14:19,132 --> 00:14:20,632
I feel bad for Seok Jin.

380
00:14:20,632 --> 00:14:21,902
Seok Jin's heart is wounded.

381
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:25,072
- My heart is wounded. - He got a heart attack.

382
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,372
You can't help but scream, right?

383
00:14:26,372 --> 00:14:27,842
(She can relate.)

384
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:29,242
I couldn't help it either.

385
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,242
Rock, paper, scissors.

386
00:14:31,242 --> 00:14:33,442
(Tae Yeon wins.)

387
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:37,812
(I have to go because I lost.)

388
00:14:41,452 --> 00:14:42,452
(Screaming)

389
00:14:42,722 --> 00:14:43,752
(Seok Jin tries to give her a high five.)

390
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:45,562
(She hates it.)

391
00:14:45,562 --> 00:14:47,592
- You acted like... - What was that?

392
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:49,192
(What am I? An insect?)

393
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:50,832
- What was that? - You acted like he was a cockroach.

394
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,132
What was that?

395
00:14:52,362 --> 00:14:54,032
You acted like he was a cockroach.

396
00:14:54,032 --> 00:14:55,732
- Seok Jin became a cockroach. - Seriously.

397
00:14:56,602 --> 00:14:58,472
I just wanted to give her a high five.

398
00:14:58,902 --> 00:15:00,302
Don't treat Seok Jin that way.

399
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,712
Rock, paper, scissors.

400
00:15:01,712 --> 00:15:05,982
(In Round 4, Tiffany wins.)

401
00:15:07,412 --> 00:15:09,812
(I can't believe I won.)

402
00:15:09,812 --> 00:15:10,912
My goodness.

403
00:15:11,212 --> 00:15:14,322
(All 4 remaining contestants are members of Girls' Generation.)

404
00:15:14,322 --> 00:15:16,522
- What is going on? - What is going on?

405
00:15:16,522 --> 00:15:18,562
- What is going on? - This is incredible.

406
00:15:18,762 --> 00:15:20,662
Yu Ri, Yoon A, Tae Yeon, and Tiffany.

407
00:15:21,492 --> 00:15:22,492
This is incredible.

408
00:15:22,492 --> 00:15:24,492
- Their reactions are... - They are genuine.

409
00:15:24,492 --> 00:15:26,532
genuine. It is very obvious.

410
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:28,062
This is happening for real.

411
00:15:28,062 --> 00:15:29,502
Now, we will have...

412
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:31,202
a match between Yu Ri and Yoon A.

413
00:15:31,202 --> 00:15:33,202
(Yoon A versus Yu Ri)

414
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:34,742
This is fierce.

415
00:15:34,742 --> 00:15:36,742
You will only get one chance.

416
00:15:37,342 --> 00:15:38,482
Who do you want to win?

417
00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:40,882
I hope Yu Ri wins.

418
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:42,152
- What about you, Yu Ri? - Yoon A.

419
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:46,022
This is like the final round of a beauty pageant.

420
00:15:46,022 --> 00:15:47,322
- Miss Korea. - Seriously.

421
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,322
- They care about each other. - That's right.

422
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:51,322
(The 10-year-old girl group has a deep friendship.)

423
00:15:51,322 --> 00:15:54,562
(Each of them wants the other to win.)

424
00:15:54,592 --> 00:15:55,632
All right.

425
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:58,662
This is the semifinal. Rock, paper, scissors.

426
00:15:59,462 --> 00:16:01,732
(Yu Ri wins.)

427
00:16:01,732 --> 00:16:03,702
For goodness' sake.

428
00:16:04,202 --> 00:16:05,802
I won.

429
00:16:07,972 --> 00:16:09,772
Seok Jin, I am sorry.

430
00:16:09,772 --> 00:16:11,142
(She hides her happiness.)

431
00:16:11,142 --> 00:16:13,082
My goodness.

432
00:16:13,082 --> 00:16:14,182
You are sad, right?

433
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,082
- All right. - This is a disaster.

434
00:16:16,082 --> 00:16:18,752
You are one step closer to becoming Seok Jin's partner.

435
00:16:19,482 --> 00:16:20,652
This is a disaster.

436
00:16:21,452 --> 00:16:22,652
(The ones who were eliminated are relaxed.)

437
00:16:22,652 --> 00:16:23,852
Good job.

438
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:26,222
This is the semifinal of rock, paper, scissors.

439
00:16:26,762 --> 00:16:28,792
Who will meet Yu Ri at the final round?

440
00:16:28,992 --> 00:16:30,292
Rock, paper, scissors.

441
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:34,532
(Tiffany wins.)

442
00:16:34,532 --> 00:16:35,972
Congratulations, Tiffany.

443
00:16:36,672 --> 00:16:38,702
You are almost there.

444
00:16:38,702 --> 00:16:40,402
Endure the wounds for a little bit longer.

445
00:16:40,902 --> 00:16:42,012
Hang in there.

446
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:43,372
Endure the wounds for a little bit longer.

447
00:16:43,372 --> 00:16:46,212
Tae Yeon, you look very happy.

448
00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:48,212
Either Tiffany or Yu Ri will be my partner.

449
00:16:48,212 --> 00:16:49,312
This is the final round, right?

450
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:50,352
- Yes. - Okay.

451
00:16:50,352 --> 00:16:52,952
This is the end.

452
00:16:53,152 --> 00:16:54,282
Let's go.

453
00:16:54,282 --> 00:16:58,962
(Only one of them gets the honor of becoming Seok Jin's partner.)

454
00:16:59,492 --> 00:17:00,622
This is the final round.

455
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:03,792
Rock, paper, scissors.

456
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:08,532
(Who is lucky enough to be Seok Jin's partner upon comeback?)

457
00:17:08,832 --> 00:17:10,072
Rock, paper, scissors.

458
00:17:10,772 --> 00:17:14,402
(Yu Ri and Seok Jin become partners.)

459
00:17:14,402 --> 00:17:15,542
My goodness.

460
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:19,942
(Screaming)

461
00:17:20,912 --> 00:17:23,712
(What a bitter victory.)

462
00:17:25,022 --> 00:17:28,082
(Strangely, the selection of Seok Jin's partner made him sad.)

463
00:17:28,452 --> 00:17:30,892
- Everyone. - I screamed without realizing it.

464
00:17:30,892 --> 00:17:31,922
(The loser accepts the defeat well.)

465
00:17:31,922 --> 00:17:33,122
So with this,

466
00:17:33,992 --> 00:17:37,592
Yu Ri and Seok Jin will be each other's partners.

467
00:17:37,592 --> 00:17:40,062
(It's settled that Seok Jin and Yu Ri will be a pair.)

468
00:17:40,062 --> 00:17:42,102
- Accept it. It's fate. - No.

469
00:17:42,802 --> 00:17:44,272
(Sighing)

470
00:17:45,602 --> 00:17:47,372
Why are you so good at rock, scissors, paper?

471
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:49,512
I don't know.

472
00:17:49,512 --> 00:17:52,112
(I don't know.)

473
00:17:52,312 --> 00:17:53,542
You did well. What's wrong?

474
00:17:53,842 --> 00:17:55,682
- You did a great job. - You won.

475
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:57,152
Accept it.

476
00:17:57,152 --> 00:17:58,212
(Seok Jin, stop pretending you're okay.)

477
00:17:58,352 --> 00:18:00,822
Next up is Kwang Soo.

478
00:18:00,822 --> 00:18:02,492
(It's Kwang Soo's turn to choose a partner.)

479
00:18:03,152 --> 00:18:05,122
- Kwang Soo has a good start. - He already loves them.

480
00:18:05,122 --> 00:18:06,962
- Everyone is looking at you. - Hold on.

481
00:18:07,092 --> 00:18:09,692
To become my partner,

482
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:12,162
you must be chosen by Mr. Barrel.

483
00:18:12,162 --> 00:18:13,562
(To become my partner, you must be chosen by Mr. Barrel.)

484
00:18:14,062 --> 00:18:18,032
(Kwang Soo is the guy Mr. Barrel has chosen.)

485
00:18:20,572 --> 00:18:22,242
(Probability-wise,)

486
00:18:22,242 --> 00:18:25,382
(it can't be explained how he is the favorite of Mr. Barrel.)

487
00:18:27,912 --> 00:18:31,282
Whoever gets Mr. Barrel to pop out will become my partner.

488
00:18:31,282 --> 00:18:32,652
- That sounds good. - All right.

489
00:18:33,152 --> 00:18:36,252
- He's the popular guy among us. - That's right.

490
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:38,422
- He's handsome. - He's the best one here.

491
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:40,392
He's pretty good-looking.

492
00:18:40,392 --> 00:18:41,962
- He's the most good-looking here. - Look. Jae Seok is laughing.

493
00:18:42,192 --> 00:18:43,662
- Among us... - Are you looking down on him?

494
00:18:43,662 --> 00:18:45,202
(Hello, I'm Kwang Soo from Running High School.)

495
00:18:45,202 --> 00:18:46,702
He's very popular here.

496
00:18:46,962 --> 00:18:48,702
Unexpectedly, you look quite nice.

497
00:18:48,702 --> 00:18:49,972
(Kwang Soo is everyone's pick.)

498
00:18:49,972 --> 00:18:51,172
- He's gone mad. - I...

499
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,672
I talk Kwang Soo up to my acquaintances a lot.

500
00:18:54,672 --> 00:18:57,172
- Everyone. - Yes?

501
00:18:57,172 --> 00:18:58,842
- We have to improve ourselves. - We have to improve our looks?

502
00:18:58,842 --> 00:19:00,382
Yes, we must.

503
00:19:00,382 --> 00:19:02,612
- Goodness. - He's the good-looking one here.

504
00:19:02,612 --> 00:19:04,282
- That's right. - I agree with him.

505
00:19:04,282 --> 00:19:05,822
- Kwang Soo, do your best. - He's the good-looking one.

506
00:19:05,822 --> 00:19:08,082
Yu Ri, but I'm ranked second though.

507
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:09,722
- But... - Yes?

508
00:19:09,722 --> 00:19:12,522
can I challenge to enter the race?

509
00:19:12,522 --> 00:19:14,192
- Do you... - Can I?

510
00:19:14,262 --> 00:19:15,632
- Stay out of this. - I mean...

511
00:19:16,392 --> 00:19:18,362
- Stay out of this. - You can't do that...

512
00:19:18,362 --> 00:19:20,862
because it was a cutthroat battle to select you as his partner.

513
00:19:20,862 --> 00:19:22,802
- This is why. - I told you to accept the reality.

514
00:19:23,002 --> 00:19:25,172
- Kwang Soo, this is good for you. - You'll be my partner for today.

515
00:19:25,842 --> 00:19:27,442
All right. Everyone.

516
00:19:27,702 --> 00:19:29,542
You should play the game one by one.

517
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:30,942
- Should we stab the barrel? - That's good.

518
00:19:31,612 --> 00:19:32,812
- Let's do this. - Stab the barrel.

519
00:19:32,812 --> 00:19:34,042
- Let's go. - Hurry.

520
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,252
- Hurry. - Goodness.

521
00:19:35,312 --> 00:19:37,082
- It'd be funny if it pops up early. - This is quite exciting.

522
00:19:37,412 --> 00:19:38,952
One of you should stab it.

523
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,582
Okay. Go back to your spot.

524
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:42,422
- Next is Hyo Yeon. - In 1, 2, 3.

525
00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:43,992
(Hyo Yeon and Soo Young pass their turns safely.)

526
00:19:43,992 --> 00:19:45,762
- You passed. - Sunny, you are next.

527
00:19:45,862 --> 00:19:46,962
- Sunny. - We'll know soon.

528
00:19:47,362 --> 00:19:49,392
I think Sunny is a bit nervous.

529
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:52,662
(Sunny, are you desperate to be my partner?)

530
00:19:53,002 --> 00:19:55,472
(Unlike other girls, Sunny seems nervous.)

531
00:19:55,472 --> 00:19:57,232
That's right. She has to get Mr. Barrel to pop out.

532
00:19:57,232 --> 00:19:58,602
(Does Sunny really want Kwang Soo as her partner?)

533
00:19:58,602 --> 00:20:00,242
She's being very careful.

534
00:20:00,602 --> 00:20:02,142
We have to see how this will go first.

535
00:20:02,142 --> 00:20:03,142
(Choosing carefully)

536
00:20:03,442 --> 00:20:04,572
It didn't pop out.

537
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:07,042
(As soon as she stabs it, she seems happy.)

538
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:09,352
- You don't want me, do you? - She doesn't want him.

539
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:14,282
(He has a realization that Sunny doesn't want him as her partner.)

540
00:20:15,352 --> 00:20:17,692
She's reacting in a similar way when it was Seok Jin's turn.

541
00:20:17,692 --> 00:20:19,262
- Fine. I got it. - Okay.

542
00:20:19,262 --> 00:20:21,092
- A similar thing happened to me. - I didn't want her either.

543
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:22,762
- Okay. - I wasn't thinking of her either.

544
00:20:22,762 --> 00:20:24,062
- Tae Yeon, you are next. - Did that hurt you?

545
00:20:24,062 --> 00:20:25,562
She's thinking hard about this.

546
00:20:25,562 --> 00:20:26,632
- Stab it. - Here we go.

547
00:20:27,002 --> 00:20:28,132
(She breathes a sigh of relief.)

548
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:29,232
Hold on.

549
00:20:31,472 --> 00:20:32,742
- What? - Can it be slow?

550
00:20:32,872 --> 00:20:33,972
Are you sad?

551
00:20:34,272 --> 00:20:35,942
- Yoon A, you're next. - She's playing it.

552
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:37,742
(Yoon A also passes her turn safely.)

553
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:39,542
She's happy about it.

554
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,712
What? You don't want me as your partner?

555
00:20:42,912 --> 00:20:43,982
- No. - You don't?

556
00:20:43,982 --> 00:20:45,822
- What is this? - She looks happy.

557
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:47,722
- She doesn't want you. - Tiffany.

558
00:20:47,722 --> 00:20:48,752
So Min.

559
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:49,852
You should take him.

560
00:20:49,852 --> 00:20:51,022
The spirit of variety shows.

561
00:20:52,222 --> 00:20:54,392
- We are starting once again. - No way, So Min.

562
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:55,462
- No way. - I'm relieved.

563
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,062
- Ji Hyo, you should take him. - Ji Hyo.

564
00:20:57,432 --> 00:20:59,062
- All right. - Let's start with her again.

565
00:20:59,062 --> 00:21:01,332
First of all, it went around once.

566
00:21:01,332 --> 00:21:02,502
(Everyone passed their first turn.)

567
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:04,332
This is a very exciting game.

568
00:21:05,742 --> 00:21:07,402
- Jae Seok, let's start with Ji Hyo. - Kwang Soo.

569
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:10,012
Did you feel that among them,

570
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:12,442
there was someone who wanted to be your partner?

571
00:21:12,442 --> 00:21:13,612
- Tell us. - So...

572
00:21:13,612 --> 00:21:15,312
it's someone who wants to be your partner, not vice versa.

573
00:21:15,312 --> 00:21:16,412
- From the feeling I got? - Yes.

574
00:21:16,412 --> 00:21:19,322
- I have about two in mind. - Isn't it Tae Yeon?

575
00:21:19,982 --> 00:21:21,822
- I bet Tae Yeon is one of them. - Really?

576
00:21:22,092 --> 00:21:23,792
- Who are they? - Who are they? Can you tell us?

577
00:21:24,192 --> 00:21:27,062
(This is embarrassing. Let me whisper their names to you.)

578
00:21:27,062 --> 00:21:31,292
- They are Tae Yeon and Yoon A. - Hold on.

579
00:21:31,432 --> 00:21:33,132
- How can you tell their names? - Well...

580
00:21:33,132 --> 00:21:35,272
- They might not be my partner. - Why did you tell me then?

581
00:21:35,272 --> 00:21:36,602
You told me to do so.

582
00:21:36,602 --> 00:21:39,102
I told you to tell us, not whisper them to me.

583
00:21:39,102 --> 00:21:40,242
Goodness. Tae Yeon?

584
00:21:40,242 --> 00:21:42,672
- He picked Tae Yeon and Yoon A. - They will try to fail on purpose.

585
00:21:42,672 --> 00:21:45,312
All right. This time, Ji Hyo, you will start.

586
00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:46,742
Go for it. You can do it.

587
00:21:47,112 --> 00:21:48,882
- It's right next to another one. - Let it pop out.

588
00:21:48,882 --> 00:21:52,052
(The girls are avoiding the dud slot as they choose very carefully.)

589
00:21:53,082 --> 00:21:54,552
(Gosh, I survived.)

590
00:21:56,222 --> 00:21:57,892
Goodness, this guy doesn't want to pop out at all.

591
00:21:57,892 --> 00:22:00,592
(Goodness, this guy doesn't want to pop out at all.)

592
00:22:00,622 --> 00:22:02,392
What is this? What's going on?

593
00:22:02,932 --> 00:22:04,832
This is weird. We have a lot of turns left.

594
00:22:04,832 --> 00:22:06,362
We never made it this far before.

595
00:22:07,132 --> 00:22:08,162
(Time has passed.)

596
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:09,802
- Tae Yeon. - Now,

597
00:22:09,902 --> 00:22:11,772
two guests you wanted still remain.

598
00:22:11,772 --> 00:22:13,642
- Tae Yeon and Yoon A have to go. - Kwang Soo.

599
00:22:13,702 --> 00:22:16,112
(Everyone can see that Mr. Barrel is about to pop out.)

600
00:22:16,112 --> 00:22:17,412
(This is a fierce battle.)

601
00:22:17,472 --> 00:22:19,482
- Tae Yeon and Yoon A have to go. - Kwang Soo.

602
00:22:19,742 --> 00:22:22,582
- Kwang Soo. - If you want it desperate, wait.

603
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:23,952
- There are five left. - All right.

604
00:22:24,682 --> 00:22:26,352
- No way. - I bet he's going to pop out.

605
00:22:26,352 --> 00:22:28,322
If she stabs the right slot...

606
00:22:28,622 --> 00:22:31,122
- Yoon A, you're up. - Is there something wrong with it?

607
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,992
(She's disappointed Mr. Barrel didn't pop out.)

608
00:22:35,492 --> 00:22:36,792
There are four left.

609
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:38,762
- This is so interesting. - If she doesn't get it...

610
00:22:42,872 --> 00:22:46,272
(Kwang Soo and Yoon A become partners.)

611
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:50,512
(The partner Mr. Barrel has chosen is Yoon A.)

612
00:22:52,012 --> 00:22:54,242
(Mr. Barrel has made my wish come true.)

613
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:55,412
Here you go.

614
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:56,752
(He's overwhelmed.)

615
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:58,422
- I was so startled. - That was cute.

616
00:22:58,552 --> 00:23:00,082
- What is this? - Excuse me.

617
00:23:00,082 --> 00:23:01,322
- I'm sorry to interrupt, - He seems so happy.

618
00:23:01,582 --> 00:23:04,152
but you two are not going to be a couple or anything.

619
00:23:04,152 --> 00:23:06,322
- I'm aware of it. - It seemed you wanted Yoon A.

620
00:23:06,322 --> 00:23:07,822
This is so funny.

621
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:10,262
- He's really different. - Mr. Barrel approved this.

622
00:23:10,762 --> 00:23:12,262
Next up is Haha.

623
00:23:12,262 --> 00:23:14,332
(Haha is the third to choose his partner.)

624
00:23:14,932 --> 00:23:16,632
- How are you going to choose yours? - Well,

625
00:23:16,702 --> 00:23:18,272
I'm going to choose the most flexible one.

626
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,742
- I'm really flexible. - Most flexible one?

627
00:23:19,742 --> 00:23:22,972
- I'll choose the most flexible one. - I'm really flexible.

628
00:23:23,342 --> 00:23:24,712
Yu Ri is the most flexible.

629
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:26,142
- Is that so? - I'm really flexible.

630
00:23:26,582 --> 00:23:29,412
(Why are we playing this game now?)

631
00:23:30,812 --> 00:23:32,122
- Hey, you. - Yu Ri.

632
00:23:32,122 --> 00:23:34,152
No, it's just that I'm sad I didn't get to play.

633
00:23:34,152 --> 00:23:35,652
- I don't want you either. - No.

634
00:23:35,652 --> 00:23:37,792
(He tries to keep the last trace of his dignity.)

635
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,962
(I don't want you either.)

636
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:41,162
(She's at a loss for words.)

637
00:23:42,992 --> 00:23:45,032
(Seok Jin is upset.)

638
00:23:45,762 --> 00:23:47,362
I was sad about the game.

639
00:23:47,362 --> 00:23:49,232
- All right. The first one... - Should I go first?

640
00:23:49,232 --> 00:23:50,402
Would you like to go first, Ji Hyo?

641
00:23:50,402 --> 00:23:53,072
Ji Hyo seems enthusiastic about the game. All right, Ji Hyo.

642
00:23:53,072 --> 00:23:55,242
- By nature, my body is stiff. - Mine too.

643
00:23:55,572 --> 00:23:56,942
I can't do the split.

644
00:23:56,942 --> 00:23:59,842
She and I live in the same district. We are close friends.

645
00:24:00,212 --> 00:24:01,812
- Don't talk. - All right.

646
00:24:01,812 --> 00:24:04,912
- It hurts already. - You have to start from here.

647
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:06,982
You have to start from here.

648
00:24:07,422 --> 00:24:08,492
Come on, Haha.

649
00:24:08,952 --> 00:24:10,752
- You need to start here. - Wait.

650
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:12,922
You're already hinting that you don't want her?

651
00:24:12,922 --> 00:24:15,092
- Go easy on her. - You're being too obvious.

652
00:24:15,092 --> 00:24:17,132
- It's not that, Ji Hyo. - He doesn't want you.

653
00:24:17,132 --> 00:24:19,402
- You little... - I'm serious.

654
00:24:19,732 --> 00:24:21,302
- Did you just curse at me? - Ji Hyo.

655
00:24:21,302 --> 00:24:22,472
- Calm down. - Don't curse in your uniform.

656
00:24:22,472 --> 00:24:23,832
Ji Hyo, please calm down.

657
00:24:23,832 --> 00:24:25,502
You have to do Muay Thai too.

658
00:24:25,572 --> 00:24:28,042
This morning, Ji Hyo put on the uniform...

659
00:24:28,072 --> 00:24:30,912
and crossed the center of the school yard with the crew.

660
00:24:30,942 --> 00:24:33,082
As soon as Se Chan saw her walking, he asked,

661
00:24:33,642 --> 00:24:36,612
"Didn't she have colorful school days?"

662
00:24:37,982 --> 00:24:39,722
I could sense that right away.

663
00:24:39,722 --> 00:24:41,082
- That's right. - I felt that.

664
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:42,092
- Didn't you sense that? - I did.

665
00:24:42,092 --> 00:24:43,952
- She gave off that vibe. - She made me feel modest.

666
00:24:45,022 --> 00:24:46,422
- We're starting. - Let's start.

667
00:24:46,422 --> 00:24:48,022
You have to start at the line.

668
00:24:48,022 --> 00:24:49,962
- Put your foot on the line. - It has to be fair.

669
00:24:49,962 --> 00:24:51,232
- Goodness. - This is good.

670
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,002
- Let's stop. - Stop.

671
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:56,202
- Okay. - Ji Hyo's record...

672
00:24:56,202 --> 00:24:57,972
- is 182cm. - Was she this flexible?

673
00:24:57,972 --> 00:24:59,342
(Flustered)

674
00:24:59,342 --> 00:25:01,542
- That's not a bad record. - You got flexible.

675
00:25:02,672 --> 00:25:05,142
(Ji Hyo's record is 182cm.)

676
00:25:05,142 --> 00:25:07,182
- You got flexible. - She's flexible.

677
00:25:07,182 --> 00:25:09,252
- Tae Yeon is next. - That was amazing.

678
00:25:09,252 --> 00:25:10,552
(Tae Yeon is the second challenger.)

679
00:25:11,452 --> 00:25:12,982
- Tae Yeon. - Can I do the split like this?

680
00:25:12,982 --> 00:25:14,182
- Of course. - That doesn't matter.

681
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:15,892
- Everyone seems willing to play. - They are.

682
00:25:15,892 --> 00:25:19,092
- We were partners a lot before. - Hold on.

683
00:25:20,822 --> 00:25:23,032
- Goodness. - To be honest... Oh, my.

684
00:25:23,032 --> 00:25:25,132
(Stretching)

685
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:27,202
Hey, try to point your toes.

686
00:25:27,202 --> 00:25:28,702
- Move back a bit. - She's doing it.

687
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,232
It's okay if you get cramps.

688
00:25:30,702 --> 00:25:31,772
- Hold on. - More.

689
00:25:31,772 --> 00:25:34,402
(Haha wants Tae Yeon as his partner. What will be the result?)

690
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,012
- All right. - Your foot...

691
00:25:40,142 --> 00:25:41,812
(Stretching)

692
00:25:41,812 --> 00:25:43,212
Your sock...

693
00:25:43,412 --> 00:25:45,682
Your sock...

694
00:25:45,682 --> 00:25:46,852
(Laughing)

695
00:25:48,122 --> 00:25:50,452
(What are they doing right now?)

696
00:25:50,452 --> 00:25:53,492
Tae Yeon's record is 200cm.

697
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:55,532
(Tae Yeon defeats Ji Hyo with the record of 200cm.)

698
00:25:55,532 --> 00:25:57,592
All right. It's 200cm.

699
00:25:58,192 --> 00:25:59,332
Tae Yeon's record is 200cm.

700
00:25:59,332 --> 00:26:00,702
Is her shoe size 300mm?

701
00:26:01,632 --> 00:26:03,602
This...

702
00:26:03,702 --> 00:26:05,802
depends on Haha since he came up with the game.

703
00:26:05,802 --> 00:26:07,142
(All right. This was good defense.)

704
00:26:07,472 --> 00:26:09,412
Hyo Yeon is next.

705
00:26:09,612 --> 00:26:10,812
Hyo Yeon.

706
00:26:10,812 --> 00:26:13,382
- I really like you. - Wasn't she on a Christmas special?

707
00:26:13,382 --> 00:26:14,842
- I mean it. You know that, right? - Yes.

708
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,252
I haven't stretched in ages.

709
00:26:16,252 --> 00:26:17,612
Stretch before you start.

710
00:26:17,812 --> 00:26:19,052
- Hyo Yeon. - Hyo Yeon.

711
00:26:19,052 --> 00:26:20,682
Do you really want me as your partner?

712
00:26:20,682 --> 00:26:21,822
Yes. Where...

713
00:26:22,322 --> 00:26:23,792
(Kicking)

714
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:26,322
(She's forced to take off her shoe.)

715
00:26:26,492 --> 00:26:28,192
This is great.

716
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:30,362
I like how active you are.

717
00:26:30,592 --> 00:26:32,362
You're eager. I like that.

718
00:26:32,362 --> 00:26:34,202
Oh, my. I got a cramp in my leg.

719
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:36,932
(I got a cramp in my leg.)

720
00:26:37,502 --> 00:26:40,402
(For the first time on a show, a singer complains of a leg cramp.)

721
00:26:41,002 --> 00:26:43,112
- It's dangerous. - Hey, stop.

722
00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:45,082
(I will help you get rid of your cramp.)

723
00:26:45,082 --> 00:26:46,212
Where is your cramp?

724
00:26:46,482 --> 00:26:48,512
- No. - Where is your cramp?

725
00:26:48,512 --> 00:26:50,452
- Right here. - Where?

726
00:26:50,712 --> 00:26:53,322
- Where is it? Are you okay? - It's right here.

727
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:54,352
(Excessive enthusiasm may cause cramps.)

728
00:26:54,352 --> 00:26:58,562
(Because of her leg cramp, the set is thrown into a chaos.)

729
00:26:59,222 --> 00:27:02,432
(This is too embarrassing that I can't look.)

730
00:27:02,432 --> 00:27:04,392
All right. Hyo Yeon is out of the game.

731
00:27:04,392 --> 00:27:06,162
(Hyo Yeon is out of the game.)

732
00:27:06,162 --> 00:27:07,402
All right. We'll exclude you.

733
00:27:07,402 --> 00:27:08,532
(This is for her own welfare.)

734
00:27:08,532 --> 00:27:10,172
- That was close. - Goodness, the look on her face.

735
00:27:10,502 --> 00:27:12,302
- Are you okay? - I really like you though.

736
00:27:13,242 --> 00:27:15,872
- Goodness, Hyo Yeon. - Sadly, she'll be excluded.

737
00:27:16,072 --> 00:27:18,172
- Hyo Yeon is disqualified. - Oh, no. She's the best.

738
00:27:18,172 --> 00:27:20,712
It's finally Soo Young's turn.

739
00:27:20,712 --> 00:27:22,452
- She has long legs. - Take off your shoes.

740
00:27:22,452 --> 00:27:24,582
- She has long legs. - Her feet are big.

741
00:27:24,752 --> 00:27:26,052
That's great.

742
00:27:26,052 --> 00:27:27,052
Goodness.

743
00:27:27,052 --> 00:27:28,322
(What will be Soo Young's record?)

744
00:27:31,962 --> 00:27:33,722
However...

745
00:27:33,722 --> 00:27:35,862
- She's better than So Min. - Soo Young.

746
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:42,702
(What are you doing, Soo Young?)

747
00:27:43,132 --> 00:27:47,472
(Is it as far as she can go?)

748
00:27:47,472 --> 00:27:49,372
- Wait a minute. - Her legs are long.

749
00:27:49,372 --> 00:27:50,942
She's not flexible at all.

750
00:27:50,942 --> 00:27:51,942
Are you being serious?

751
00:27:51,942 --> 00:27:53,042
Soo Young.

752
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:55,552
(She's being serious indeed.)

753
00:27:55,552 --> 00:27:57,552
- Her legs are long. - Wait a minute.

754
00:27:57,552 --> 00:27:59,982
- She's not flexible at all. - Go back.

755
00:28:00,052 --> 00:28:02,222
- Soo Young. - What's wrong with her?

756
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,652
- Let's see. - Come on, you can do it.

757
00:28:04,652 --> 00:28:07,322
- Stretch farther. - You can do it.

758
00:28:07,322 --> 00:28:11,702
(Will she break the record?)

759
00:28:11,702 --> 00:28:13,632
- Soo Young wins. - It's 210cm.

760
00:28:13,632 --> 00:28:16,532
(Her record is 210cm.)

761
00:28:16,532 --> 00:28:20,072
- Her legs are cramping. - Your legs are so long.

762
00:28:20,072 --> 00:28:21,442
(Soo Young wins.)

763
00:28:22,142 --> 00:28:23,942
- She went over the line. - By the way,

764
00:28:23,942 --> 00:28:26,142
there must be bad girls among them.

765
00:28:26,142 --> 00:28:29,752
(There must be bad girls among them.)

766
00:28:29,752 --> 00:28:31,052
Is that true?

767
00:28:31,052 --> 00:28:32,752
That's why they're working hard.

768
00:28:34,352 --> 00:28:35,752
Do bad girls work hard?

769
00:28:35,752 --> 00:28:37,752
Everyone, I just got goosebumps.

770
00:28:37,752 --> 00:28:40,062
- I thought they simply liked me. - Bad girls must find partners.

771
00:28:40,222 --> 00:28:43,262
Three bad girls are given a mission.

772
00:28:43,562 --> 00:28:44,932
They must find a partner.

773
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,032
Otherwise, they get an ice shower.

774
00:28:46,032 --> 00:28:47,202
I see.

775
00:28:47,202 --> 00:28:49,402
(Bad girls must do their best to find partners.)

776
00:28:49,732 --> 00:28:53,442
(Who are the bad girls among them?)

777
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:54,442
Are you a bad girl?

778
00:28:54,642 --> 00:28:56,442
- What? - You can't tell us, right?

779
00:28:56,442 --> 00:28:57,812
She's definitely not it.

780
00:28:58,012 --> 00:28:59,312
My goodness.

781
00:28:59,312 --> 00:29:01,012
- I tried my best. - She worked very hard.

782
00:29:01,012 --> 00:29:03,182
I played rock, paper, scissors and won.

783
00:29:03,312 --> 00:29:05,582
- She's not it. - I won the game.

784
00:29:05,582 --> 00:29:10,192
Haha's partner is Soo Young.

785
00:29:10,192 --> 00:29:12,062
(Haha and Soo Young get paired up.)

786
00:29:13,622 --> 00:29:18,032
You only have three chances...

787
00:29:18,032 --> 00:29:20,102
- to find a partner. - It's competitive.

788
00:29:20,102 --> 00:29:22,432
Those who don't get a partner...

789
00:29:22,702 --> 00:29:25,542
have to be on a different team.

790
00:29:25,572 --> 00:29:28,142
I'd like to see how much fun you can have.

791
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,142
- "Fun"? - Yes.

792
00:29:29,242 --> 00:29:31,212
Express the amount of fun you have.

793
00:29:31,242 --> 00:29:32,812
You don't have to dance.

794
00:29:32,942 --> 00:29:34,182
Let's play some music.

795
00:29:34,182 --> 00:29:36,552
Let's take a look since one of them likes to dance.

796
00:29:36,552 --> 00:29:40,852
Shouldn't they express themselves without music?

797
00:29:41,152 --> 00:29:43,552
- We'll play music for them. - Right.

798
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,122
Se Chan dances well.

799
00:29:45,122 --> 00:29:46,192
This is an example.

800
00:29:46,462 --> 00:29:48,862
(He demonstrates dancing without music.)

801
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,732
(Singing)

802
00:29:50,732 --> 00:29:52,262
(He enjoys himself.)

803
00:29:52,262 --> 00:29:54,562
(He's full of fun.)

804
00:29:54,562 --> 00:29:58,072
Do something like this, and show me your fun

805
00:29:58,072 --> 00:29:59,742
(Jae Seok's partner must be a lot of fun.)

806
00:30:00,142 --> 00:30:01,302
That's great.

807
00:30:01,302 --> 00:30:02,342
(Will she get another chance?)

808
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,942
It's more than possible. You can do it.

809
00:30:05,442 --> 00:30:06,742
(What is she doing?)

810
00:30:06,742 --> 00:30:07,742
It's possible.

811
00:30:08,452 --> 00:30:09,452
That's good.

812
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:15,552
(So Min tucks in her skirt to dance.)

813
00:30:17,052 --> 00:30:22,032
(She dances without any music.)

814
00:30:23,162 --> 00:30:24,162
(She grabs him.)

815
00:30:25,062 --> 00:30:28,232
(Jae Seok, let me be your partner.)

816
00:30:28,872 --> 00:30:31,902
(She experiences a culture shock.)

817
00:30:31,902 --> 00:30:33,072
Look at her skirt.

818
00:30:33,802 --> 00:30:35,542
Look at her skirt.

819
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,572
She did it.

820
00:30:36,572 --> 00:30:37,712
(What have you done with your skirt?)

821
00:30:38,612 --> 00:30:41,342
(She has tight pants on.)

822
00:30:41,852 --> 00:30:43,552
What kind of pants are they?

823
00:30:44,182 --> 00:30:45,952
She's so annoying.

824
00:30:46,122 --> 00:30:48,452
What are you doing?

825
00:30:48,452 --> 00:30:51,022
- Goodness. - She lost her mind.

826
00:30:51,022 --> 00:30:52,022
Gosh.

827
00:30:52,022 --> 00:30:54,522
All of you seem lost in thoughts.

828
00:30:55,362 --> 00:30:57,332
My mind went blank.

829
00:30:57,462 --> 00:30:59,002
- It's because... - I don't know what to do.

830
00:30:59,002 --> 00:31:01,562
they didn't expect anything like this.

831
00:31:01,702 --> 00:31:03,472
Why did you tuck in your skirt?

832
00:31:03,472 --> 00:31:05,202
I can't believe it.

833
00:31:05,702 --> 00:31:07,972
All right, please play the music.

834
00:31:08,342 --> 00:31:12,442
(It's time to find Jae Seok's partner.)

835
00:31:12,442 --> 00:31:14,412
This song is for dancing.

836
00:31:15,012 --> 00:31:16,052
Isn't it a great song?

837
00:31:16,052 --> 00:31:17,382
(Only 3 out of 6 will find a partner.)

838
00:31:17,382 --> 00:31:18,582
- This is exciting. - It's great.

839
00:31:19,122 --> 00:31:20,552
(Ji Hyo approaches.)

840
00:31:21,052 --> 00:31:22,422
That's great.

841
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:24,292
You're doing well, Ji Hyo.

842
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:25,292
(She dances for Jae Seok.)

843
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:27,292
She can't control her excitement.

844
00:31:27,292 --> 00:31:28,832
(Jae Seok is impressed.)

845
00:31:29,232 --> 00:31:30,862
She can't control it.

846
00:31:30,862 --> 00:31:31,862
- Let's go. - That's right.

847
00:31:31,862 --> 00:31:33,262
- Let's go. - Let's go.

848
00:31:33,302 --> 00:31:36,472
(Jae Seok, make me your partner.)

849
00:31:37,072 --> 00:31:39,102
(Ji Hyo knows how to have fun.)

850
00:31:39,502 --> 00:31:41,542
(Running Man members are intense.)

851
00:31:42,072 --> 00:31:43,542
(Having a partner is an advantage.)

852
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:45,712
She can't control her excitement.

853
00:31:45,942 --> 00:31:47,042
That's great.

854
00:31:47,042 --> 00:31:48,212
(Having a partner is an advantage.)

855
00:31:49,712 --> 00:31:50,712
You can stop.

856
00:31:51,082 --> 00:31:53,352
Go back to your place, Ji Hyo.

857
00:31:53,552 --> 00:31:55,222
Go back.

858
00:31:55,452 --> 00:31:57,922
- Next up is So Min. - So Min is up.

859
00:31:57,922 --> 00:31:59,422
(So Min starts.)

860
00:31:59,862 --> 00:32:00,862
Here's So Min.

861
00:32:00,862 --> 00:32:01,932
(Dancing left to right)

862
00:32:02,492 --> 00:32:08,062
(She dances and bounces like a gangster.)

863
00:32:08,062 --> 00:32:10,372
What's wrong with her?

864
00:32:10,372 --> 00:32:11,472
Goodness.

865
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:13,802
(What do you think of me, Jae Seok?)

866
00:32:16,242 --> 00:32:17,242
So Min is great.

867
00:32:17,472 --> 00:32:20,312
(They look like a pair of gorillas.)

868
00:32:21,342 --> 00:32:22,352
She's great.

869
00:32:22,712 --> 00:32:23,712
That's good.

870
00:32:23,712 --> 00:32:25,582
(Her dance gets more desperate.)

871
00:32:25,582 --> 00:32:27,452
What kind of move is this?

872
00:32:30,222 --> 00:32:33,092
(She gives up competing against her.)

873
00:32:33,192 --> 00:32:34,222
My goodness.

874
00:32:34,222 --> 00:32:35,932
She's impressive.

875
00:32:35,932 --> 00:32:37,762
- Keep going! - I can't watch her anymore.

876
00:32:37,762 --> 00:32:39,832
(I'm Jae Seok's partner today.)

877
00:32:41,102 --> 00:32:42,602
- Here she comes. - You should go.

878
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,002
It's Hyo Yeon.

879
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:47,042
(She's full of confidence.)

880
00:32:47,442 --> 00:32:51,542
(She grooves with confidence with 10 years of experience.)

881
00:32:54,952 --> 00:32:56,052
She dances well.

882
00:32:56,482 --> 00:32:58,552
(She gets into the music.)

883
00:32:59,222 --> 00:33:01,922
(He likes Hyo Yeon's dance.)

884
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,992
She dances well.

885
00:33:03,492 --> 00:33:05,722
(Do you want to dance with me, Yu Ri?)

886
00:33:06,292 --> 00:33:07,292
Yu Ri.

887
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:10,332
(I already have a partner.)

888
00:33:10,332 --> 00:33:12,902
(She joins her.)

889
00:33:13,532 --> 00:33:15,732
(What are you doing?)

890
00:33:16,102 --> 00:33:17,172
(She dances her heart out.)

891
00:33:19,102 --> 00:33:21,712
(She dances passionately, hoping to change her partner.)

892
00:33:21,712 --> 00:33:22,712
(She makes weird noises.)

893
00:33:23,342 --> 00:33:26,512
(She expresses her regret of having Seok Jin as her partner.)

894
00:33:27,482 --> 00:33:28,482
Goodness.

895
00:33:28,482 --> 00:33:29,482
(He's disappointed.)

896
00:33:30,552 --> 00:33:32,852
Next up is Soo Young.

897
00:33:32,852 --> 00:33:35,152
Show us your hip hop dance.

898
00:33:35,152 --> 00:33:36,692
- Hip hop. - Hip hop.

899
00:33:36,692 --> 00:33:38,192
- Hip hop. - Dance hip hop.

900
00:33:38,622 --> 00:33:40,922
(Are you talking about this?)

901
00:33:40,922 --> 00:33:41,962
What are you doing?

902
00:33:42,392 --> 00:33:44,132
(It looks creepy.)

903
00:33:45,102 --> 00:33:47,802
- That's not hip hop. - Where's hip hop?

904
00:33:48,332 --> 00:33:50,432
What kind of hip hop is that?

905
00:33:50,432 --> 00:33:51,472
Wait a minute.

906
00:33:51,472 --> 00:33:53,202
(It's similar to a comedian's dance.)

907
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:55,272
That's unbelievable.

908
00:33:55,912 --> 00:33:58,112
(Please don't do that, Soo Young.)

909
00:33:59,642 --> 00:34:00,912
How about you, Yoon A?

910
00:34:00,912 --> 00:34:01,912
(My partner is the best.)

911
00:34:02,482 --> 00:34:04,352
Next up is Tae Yeon.

912
00:34:05,452 --> 00:34:09,592
(She bounces lightly.)

913
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:13,122
(She gets very cute with her bounces.)

914
00:34:14,562 --> 00:34:17,462
(Do you want to be my partner, Jae Seok?)

915
00:34:18,062 --> 00:34:19,702
(Of course, I do.)

916
00:34:20,632 --> 00:34:21,702
Goodness.

917
00:34:21,702 --> 00:34:25,472
(She attracts others who have partners already.)

918
00:34:26,372 --> 00:34:27,372
(He gets on the floor.)

919
00:34:28,272 --> 00:34:30,912
(Bouncing)

920
00:34:31,372 --> 00:34:37,052
(Inspired by Tae Yeon, Haha creates his R-rated bouncing.)

921
00:34:38,112 --> 00:34:39,452
(Sunny is up next.)

922
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,552
Next up is Sunny.

923
00:34:41,552 --> 00:34:43,992
- It's your turn, Sunny. - That was funny.

924
00:34:44,222 --> 00:34:46,322
She's so good at dancing.

925
00:34:46,322 --> 00:34:48,432
There she goes.

926
00:34:51,662 --> 00:34:55,332
(She's cute and sexy.)

927
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:59,542
(They go weak at the knees for Sunny.)

928
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:02,342
(She does a body wave.)

929
00:35:02,342 --> 00:35:03,542
She dances so well.

930
00:35:03,542 --> 00:35:05,542
(She does a body wave with confidence.)

931
00:35:06,142 --> 00:35:08,012
(She's so good.)

932
00:35:08,012 --> 00:35:09,552
Next is So Min.

933
00:35:09,552 --> 00:35:10,912
(So Min dances again.)

934
00:35:10,912 --> 00:35:12,382
- Go. - Go, So Min.

935
00:35:12,382 --> 00:35:13,752
(Shall I try again?)

936
00:35:14,282 --> 00:35:16,592
(What is she doing?)

937
00:35:17,592 --> 00:35:23,562
(She's not as good as Sunny, but she slides on the floor.)

938
00:35:23,562 --> 00:35:25,132
(Moving about)

939
00:35:27,302 --> 00:35:29,432
- Stop it. - So Min.

940
00:35:29,432 --> 00:35:32,742
- Please stop dancing. - Stop it.

941
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:33,942
Hey!

942
00:35:33,942 --> 00:35:34,942
(The music stops.)

943
00:35:36,272 --> 00:35:39,342
So Min, do your own dance.

944
00:35:39,712 --> 00:35:41,712
Why did you ruin the fun?

945
00:35:42,482 --> 00:35:44,952
- I wanted to try it. - She wanted to try it.

946
00:35:44,952 --> 00:35:46,352
- You'll hurt your knees. - Do your own dance.

947
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,582
She wanted to imitate her.

948
00:35:47,582 --> 00:35:50,052
Yu Ri was hilarious. She wanted to survive.

949
00:35:50,492 --> 00:35:51,552
(She danced out of desperation.)

950
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:53,122
She wanted to get another chance.

951
00:35:53,122 --> 00:35:54,762
(She danced out of desperation.)

952
00:35:54,762 --> 00:35:57,092
- Come on. - You danced well.

953
00:35:58,602 --> 00:36:04,002
(She danced passionately, hoping to change her partner.)

954
00:36:04,702 --> 00:36:07,542
(Seok Jin is sad.)

955
00:36:08,312 --> 00:36:10,072
Please save me.

956
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:12,042
"Help me!"

957
00:36:12,742 --> 00:36:14,112
"Someone is drowning!"

958
00:36:16,282 --> 00:36:17,652
Should I laugh?

959
00:36:17,652 --> 00:36:18,922
- Yes. - I should laugh, right?

960
00:36:18,922 --> 00:36:19,922
You should laugh.

961
00:36:19,922 --> 00:36:22,052
You'll seem laid-back if you laugh.

962
00:36:22,752 --> 00:36:26,362
It's very difficult to select a partner.

963
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:29,562
Let's imagine that we're at a dance club.

964
00:36:29,962 --> 00:36:34,302
The person to pick the number one spoon will be my partner.

965
00:36:34,302 --> 00:36:35,302
(The person to pick number one becomes his partner.)

966
00:36:36,172 --> 00:36:39,902
(Running Man's dance club opens.)

967
00:36:40,572 --> 00:36:45,912
(I heard this club is full of hot boys.)

968
00:36:47,112 --> 00:36:48,182
Here he comes.

969
00:36:48,812 --> 00:36:50,912
(Who is this man?)

970
00:36:51,212 --> 00:36:52,322
He's hot.

971
00:36:52,822 --> 00:36:55,152
He's hot. It's Jae Seok.

972
00:36:55,322 --> 00:36:57,122
It's Jae Seok.

973
00:36:57,122 --> 00:36:58,222
Gosh, it's him.

974
00:36:58,562 --> 00:37:00,362
(He steals everyone's attention.)

975
00:37:00,362 --> 00:37:01,362
It's Jae Seok.

976
00:37:02,492 --> 00:37:04,832
(He's Jae Seok who knows how to have fun.)

977
00:37:06,262 --> 00:37:11,032
(All the women are excited to see Jae Seok.)

978
00:37:11,032 --> 00:37:14,242
(They want to be partners with him.)

979
00:37:15,142 --> 00:37:16,212
(It's tiring to be so popular.)

980
00:37:16,212 --> 00:37:17,242
It's Jae Seok.

981
00:37:17,242 --> 00:37:18,312
(It's tiring to be so popular.)

982
00:37:19,042 --> 00:37:21,712
(Splash)

983
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,282
(I'm sorry. You looked so cool.)

984
00:37:25,752 --> 00:37:28,792
(The hot guy is understanding.)

985
00:37:28,792 --> 00:37:31,152
- He's so cool. - He's amazing.

986
00:37:31,152 --> 00:37:33,222
- He's sexy. - He's so cool.

987
00:37:33,392 --> 00:37:38,262
(Sunny picks a spoon.)

988
00:37:39,232 --> 00:37:42,132
(Sunny is eliminated.)

989
00:37:42,832 --> 00:37:45,602
(Spitting)

990
00:37:45,602 --> 00:37:49,572
(Fine, I'll get going.)

991
00:37:49,912 --> 00:37:52,512
(I'm sorry.)

992
00:37:54,142 --> 00:37:56,882
(Hyo Yeon is eliminated.)

993
00:37:56,882 --> 00:37:59,482
(Tae Yeon is eliminated.)

994
00:37:59,882 --> 00:38:01,082
There are not many left.

995
00:38:01,252 --> 00:38:02,622
There are not many left.

996
00:38:03,552 --> 00:38:04,892
It serves you right.

997
00:38:04,892 --> 00:38:06,092
(Only Tiffany, Ji Hyo, and So Min are left.)

998
00:38:06,392 --> 00:38:08,832
(Tiffany is eliminated.)

999
00:38:10,092 --> 00:38:13,002
(The remaining ones are...)

1000
00:38:13,532 --> 00:38:17,232
(Family is the best.)

1001
00:38:18,032 --> 00:38:21,442
(Come here, Jae Seok.)

1002
00:38:22,642 --> 00:38:25,782
(The final candidates are Ji Hyo and So Min.)

1003
00:38:28,752 --> 00:38:32,952
(Hi, Running High School's hottest boy.)

1004
00:38:33,582 --> 00:38:38,322
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo become partners.)

1005
00:38:38,722 --> 00:38:41,362
Now, it's Se Chan's turn.

1006
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:42,862
(Se Chan and Jong Kook are the only male members left.)

1007
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,002
We've been having so much fun. It's time to calm down.

1008
00:38:45,002 --> 00:38:47,632
Let's calm down a little.

1009
00:38:47,632 --> 00:38:49,872
(We have to be chosen this time.)

1010
00:38:50,772 --> 00:38:53,642
Let's do an acrostic poem with my name.

1011
00:38:53,642 --> 00:38:55,342
- With "Yang Se Chan". - That's not easy.

1012
00:38:55,342 --> 00:38:57,642
Make it funny, clever,

1013
00:38:57,642 --> 00:38:59,282
or romantic.

1014
00:38:59,782 --> 00:39:02,012
- They can choose. - If I hear it...

1015
00:39:02,012 --> 00:39:03,712
- and like it, - It's for your own satisfaction.

1016
00:39:03,782 --> 00:39:05,382
- I'll choose that person. - Selfish interests.

1017
00:39:05,382 --> 00:39:08,622
I'm not sure if the bad girls are...

1018
00:39:08,622 --> 00:39:10,692
among these three.

1019
00:39:11,052 --> 00:39:13,292
If they are, they have to be chosen.

1020
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:14,662
- That's right. - That's right.

1021
00:39:15,132 --> 00:39:16,362
(The bad girls have to be chosen by either Se Chan or Jong Kook.)

1022
00:39:16,362 --> 00:39:19,932
The bad girls have to be chosen.

1023
00:39:21,002 --> 00:39:22,702
Let's start from Sunny.

1024
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:26,272
I want to hear hers last.

1025
00:39:26,272 --> 00:39:27,442
- You do? - Yes.

1026
00:39:28,072 --> 00:39:29,512
- Really? - Yes.

1027
00:39:29,512 --> 00:39:31,442
- What are you doing? - What's with you?

1028
00:39:31,442 --> 00:39:32,942
- I want to hear hers last. - I see.

1029
00:39:32,982 --> 00:39:34,782
Just choose Sunny.

1030
00:39:34,782 --> 00:39:36,752
(If that's how you're going to be...)

1031
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:37,812
Sorry?

1032
00:39:37,812 --> 00:39:39,522
She's losing her patience.

1033
00:39:39,522 --> 00:39:41,052
It's too hot here.

1034
00:39:41,052 --> 00:39:42,822
All right.

1035
00:39:42,822 --> 00:39:44,392
Let's start from So Min.

1036
00:39:45,192 --> 00:39:47,822
(So Min goes first.)

1037
00:39:47,822 --> 00:39:49,062
- All right. - Let's do this.

1038
00:39:49,162 --> 00:39:51,392
An acrostic poem with "Yang Se Chan".

1039
00:39:51,632 --> 00:39:53,302
Come here.

1040
00:39:54,832 --> 00:39:56,432
Are we supposed to look at each other?

1041
00:39:56,432 --> 00:39:57,972
(It's too much for her.)

1042
00:39:57,972 --> 00:39:59,242
- Yes. - Yes.

1043
00:39:59,602 --> 00:40:00,842
Later,

1044
00:40:00,842 --> 00:40:03,372
we'll hold hands too.

1045
00:40:03,372 --> 00:40:04,812
Why would you hold hands?

1046
00:40:04,812 --> 00:40:07,142
- Are you going to hold hands? - Yes, for the sake of variety.

1047
00:40:07,142 --> 00:40:08,352
But not now.

1048
00:40:08,352 --> 00:40:10,052
(We're not holding hands now.)

1049
00:40:10,052 --> 00:40:11,382
Just stand straight.

1050
00:40:11,382 --> 00:40:13,582
No. Stand straight.

1051
00:40:13,582 --> 00:40:15,522
We'll start standing straight.

1052
00:40:15,522 --> 00:40:17,522
Stand straight.

1053
00:40:17,522 --> 00:40:18,822
I'm sorry.

1054
00:40:19,262 --> 00:40:20,862
- Not now. - Give me your hands.

1055
00:40:20,862 --> 00:40:22,562
Why don't you make her turn around?

1056
00:40:22,592 --> 00:40:23,692
- Turn around? - Yes.

1057
00:40:23,732 --> 00:40:26,102
That sounds good. Turn around.

1058
00:40:26,362 --> 00:40:28,972
Look at the mountain over there.

1059
00:40:28,972 --> 00:40:30,802
Look at the mountain far away.

1060
00:40:30,802 --> 00:40:35,072
Imagine I'm over there.

1061
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,612
Look away.

1062
00:40:37,612 --> 00:40:38,712
Yang.

1063
00:40:39,212 --> 00:40:40,612
- Yang? - Yang.

1064
00:40:40,782 --> 00:40:42,552
Yang, you punk.

1065
00:40:43,012 --> 00:40:44,482
What did you say?

1066
00:40:44,712 --> 00:40:47,822
(Yang, you punk.)

1067
00:40:48,552 --> 00:40:50,352
- What did you say? - "Yang, you punk?"

1068
00:40:50,352 --> 00:40:52,262
Can't you make it nicer?

1069
00:40:52,362 --> 00:40:54,622
- Yang... - Yang.

1070
00:40:54,622 --> 00:40:56,432
Yang. Look away.

1071
00:40:56,992 --> 00:40:58,462
Yang.

1072
00:40:58,462 --> 00:41:01,032
(She is forced to look away.)

1073
00:41:01,362 --> 00:41:02,402
Se.

1074
00:41:02,572 --> 00:41:03,802
Gosh, you brat.

1075
00:41:03,802 --> 00:41:07,472
(Gosh, you brat.)

1076
00:41:07,472 --> 00:41:08,772
What are you doing?

1077
00:41:08,772 --> 00:41:11,242
Just insult me in my ear.

1078
00:41:11,272 --> 00:41:13,342
- It's an acrostic poem. - It is?

1079
00:41:13,582 --> 00:41:15,152
Why do you put weird words in the beginning?

1080
00:41:15,152 --> 00:41:17,782
- She said, "you punk". - Yang Se.

1081
00:41:17,782 --> 00:41:19,252
She said, "you punk".

1082
00:41:19,322 --> 00:41:20,382
Chan.

1083
00:41:20,952 --> 00:41:23,052
Chan.

1084
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:24,452
Is that it?

1085
00:41:24,892 --> 00:41:25,962
Chan.

1086
00:41:25,962 --> 00:41:27,062
Get lost.

1087
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:28,632
Disappear into the mountain.

1088
00:41:29,032 --> 00:41:30,462
(Chan)

1089
00:41:30,462 --> 00:41:31,662
That's enough.

1090
00:41:32,362 --> 00:41:35,272
Is she drunk?

1091
00:41:35,802 --> 00:41:38,472
So Min, it wasn't bad. I get your intention.

1092
00:41:38,742 --> 00:41:40,402
All right. Tae Yeon.

1093
00:41:40,472 --> 00:41:41,912
They should hold hands.

1094
00:41:42,072 --> 00:41:43,942
- Both hands? - Yes.

1095
00:41:43,942 --> 00:41:45,142
Both hands.

1096
00:41:45,142 --> 00:41:46,642
- Both hands? - Yes.

1097
00:41:46,642 --> 00:41:47,742
Both hands.

1098
00:41:47,742 --> 00:41:49,012
What are you doing?

1099
00:41:49,212 --> 00:41:50,952
It's to develop a new kind of acrostic poem.

1100
00:41:50,952 --> 00:41:52,252
What are you doing?

1101
00:41:52,252 --> 00:41:53,422
What is this?

1102
00:41:53,422 --> 00:41:55,252
It'd be boring if we just stand straight.

1103
00:41:55,252 --> 00:41:57,152
- Give me the first word. - Yang.

1104
00:41:57,152 --> 00:41:58,252
What are you? A punk?

1105
00:41:58,252 --> 00:42:01,592
(Are you a punk?)

1106
00:42:01,592 --> 00:42:02,932
That was great.

1107
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:05,532
- I love her voice. - Good job.

1108
00:42:05,762 --> 00:42:07,502
- Her voice is amazing. - What are you? A punk?

1109
00:42:07,502 --> 00:42:09,232
It was amazing.

1110
00:42:09,702 --> 00:42:11,532
- What are you? A punk? - I love that.

1111
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:13,342
- Se. - My goodness.

1112
00:42:14,842 --> 00:42:16,372
- Chan. - Cut it out.

1113
00:42:16,372 --> 00:42:19,442
(Cut it out.)

1114
00:42:20,112 --> 00:42:23,152
(It was a simple and clever poem.)

1115
00:42:23,152 --> 00:42:24,452
That was great.

1116
00:42:25,652 --> 00:42:27,222
You're amazing.

1117
00:42:27,452 --> 00:42:28,952
I love her voice.

1118
00:42:30,192 --> 00:42:32,462
- What are you? A punk? - I love that.

1119
00:42:32,922 --> 00:42:34,992
- Good job. - Hyo Yeon.

1120
00:42:34,992 --> 00:42:36,292
(It's Hyo Yeon's turn.)

1121
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,302
- Are you ready? - Yes.

1122
00:42:39,032 --> 00:42:40,062
Yang.

1123
00:42:40,462 --> 00:42:41,802
Quality over quantity.

1124
00:42:41,802 --> 00:42:45,702
(Quality over quantity)

1125
00:42:45,702 --> 00:42:46,772
Se.

1126
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,372
- I'm a tenant. - A tenant?

1127
00:42:48,372 --> 00:42:52,342
(I'm a tenant.)

1128
00:42:53,342 --> 00:42:54,982
I can relate.

1129
00:42:54,982 --> 00:42:56,252
- I'm a tenant. - You're a tenant.

1130
00:42:56,252 --> 00:42:57,582
Quality over quantity, and I'm a tenant.

1131
00:42:57,582 --> 00:43:00,252
It makes sense. Okay.

1132
00:43:00,252 --> 00:43:01,252
Chan.

1133
00:43:01,252 --> 00:43:02,252
I have no cold water.

1134
00:43:02,252 --> 00:43:04,592
(I have no cold water.)

1135
00:43:04,592 --> 00:43:09,292
(It was a clever, realistic poem that Se Chan could relate to.)

1136
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:15,802
(It deals with the depressing situation many tenants are in.)

1137
00:43:15,972 --> 00:43:18,842
"I'm a tenant, and I have no cold water."

1138
00:43:21,242 --> 00:43:22,312
It was clever.

1139
00:43:22,312 --> 00:43:24,672
Well... Tae Yeon...

1140
00:43:25,442 --> 00:43:31,652
(Sunny is standing before Se Chan.)

1141
00:43:32,182 --> 00:43:35,292
I think he'll choose Sunny regardless.

1142
00:43:35,292 --> 00:43:38,152
- It's neck and neck. - You can change the format too.

1143
00:43:38,192 --> 00:43:40,122
Sunny, do a cute one.

1144
00:43:40,122 --> 00:43:41,162
Cute one?

1145
00:43:41,162 --> 00:43:42,462
I'll let go of your hands.

1146
00:43:42,462 --> 00:43:45,302
(If you're going to do a cute one, I'll let go of your hands.)

1147
00:43:45,302 --> 00:43:46,902
Do whatever you want.

1148
00:43:47,262 --> 00:43:49,932
- "Do whatever you want?" - Surprise me.

1149
00:43:49,932 --> 00:43:51,132
I won't look away.

1150
00:43:51,132 --> 00:43:52,542
(What is she going to do?)

1151
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:53,972
- Sunny. - Let's go.

1152
00:43:53,972 --> 00:43:55,072
Here we go.

1153
00:43:55,472 --> 00:43:56,772
Yang.

1154
00:43:57,712 --> 00:43:59,342
I'm a sheep.

1155
00:43:59,342 --> 00:44:02,052
(I'm a sheep.)

1156
00:44:02,052 --> 00:44:08,222
(A sheep? From the beginning?)

1157
00:44:08,222 --> 00:44:09,392
My goodness.

1158
00:44:11,892 --> 00:44:15,362
(The impact is massive.)

1159
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:18,462
Unbelievable.

1160
00:44:18,462 --> 00:44:20,302
(I have a partner. I shouldn't be like this.)

1161
00:44:21,262 --> 00:44:22,402
Se.

1162
00:44:23,032 --> 00:44:24,332
Let's not look at her.

1163
00:44:24,332 --> 00:44:26,202
I wash my face.

1164
00:44:26,202 --> 00:44:30,272
(I wash my face.)

1165
00:44:30,272 --> 00:44:37,512
(You can do whatever you want.)

1166
00:44:37,512 --> 00:44:41,152
(I can't breathe.)

1167
00:44:41,992 --> 00:44:43,052
Chan.

1168
00:44:43,052 --> 00:44:45,292
It's a beautiful morning.

1169
00:44:45,292 --> 00:44:47,492
(It's a beautiful morning.)

1170
00:44:47,492 --> 00:44:49,092
(Cute)

1171
00:44:52,132 --> 00:44:54,832
I've made up my mind.

1172
00:44:55,632 --> 00:44:58,372
- My goodness. - Amazing.

1173
00:44:58,372 --> 00:44:59,772
- I love it. - Good job.

1174
00:44:59,772 --> 00:45:02,442
(What is that sheep?)

1175
00:45:02,442 --> 00:45:03,442
It was so clever.

1176
00:45:04,842 --> 00:45:06,642
I'm a sheep.

1177
00:45:07,442 --> 00:45:09,812
- I'm a sheep. - So Min.

1178
00:45:09,812 --> 00:45:10,952
Stop it.

1179
00:45:12,052 --> 00:45:13,922
- Try. - Try.

1180
00:45:14,452 --> 00:45:16,392
Give it a try.

1181
00:45:16,392 --> 00:45:17,392
Go.

1182
00:45:19,292 --> 00:45:21,662
- I'm a sheep. - You are?

1183
00:45:22,392 --> 00:45:24,892
- I wash my face. - I see.

1184
00:45:25,532 --> 00:45:27,302
It's a beautiful morning.

1185
00:45:27,302 --> 00:45:29,002
Okay, next.

1186
00:45:29,402 --> 00:45:31,202
It's a beautiful morning.

1187
00:45:31,202 --> 00:45:32,872
Okay, next.

1188
00:45:33,942 --> 00:45:39,682
(It doesn't work for So Min.)

1189
00:45:39,682 --> 00:45:41,242
(I want only Sunny.)

1190
00:45:41,812 --> 00:45:44,382
- Se Chan. - All right.

1191
00:45:44,552 --> 00:45:46,682
Sunny is here.

1192
00:45:47,282 --> 00:45:48,392
No.

1193
00:45:48,392 --> 00:45:50,622
(He hesitates.)

1194
00:45:50,652 --> 00:45:51,962
Just tell me, and I'll...

1195
00:45:52,662 --> 00:45:53,822
- This will be easier. - Yes.

1196
00:45:53,822 --> 00:45:55,062
- Please say it loud. - Sure.

1197
00:45:56,392 --> 00:45:57,492
So.

1198
00:45:58,262 --> 00:45:59,602
What?

1199
00:46:00,332 --> 00:46:02,032
That's what I heard.

1200
00:46:02,032 --> 00:46:04,132
There has been a misunderstanding.

1201
00:46:04,132 --> 00:46:05,472
My pronunciation was bad, right?

1202
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:07,372
- That's what I heard. - Diction is important.

1203
00:46:07,372 --> 00:46:08,742
Diction. Pronunciation.

1204
00:46:09,012 --> 00:46:10,542
- Pronunciation. - All right.

1205
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:12,812
(Enunciating)

1206
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:13,842
Sun...

1207
00:46:14,682 --> 00:46:15,852
Sun...

1208
00:46:15,852 --> 00:46:17,282
(Angry)

1209
00:46:17,282 --> 00:46:18,382
Sunny.

1210
00:46:18,382 --> 00:46:21,122
(Se Chan chooses Sunny.)

1211
00:46:21,452 --> 00:46:22,852
(Se Chan and Sunny become partners.)

1212
00:46:22,852 --> 00:46:24,252
They look cute together.

1213
00:46:26,922 --> 00:46:30,832
Seok Jin and Yu Ri,

1214
00:46:30,832 --> 00:46:34,532
Haha and Soo Young, Kwang Soo and Yoon A, Jae Seok and Ji Hyo,

1215
00:46:34,532 --> 00:46:37,702
Se Chan and Sunny, and Jong Kook and Tiffany are partners.

1216
00:46:37,832 --> 00:46:39,202
You belong to Team Partners.

1217
00:46:39,442 --> 00:46:42,642
So Min, Hyo Yeon, and Tae Yeon belong to Team Singles.

1218
00:46:42,642 --> 00:46:44,442
(These three don't have partners.)

1219
00:46:44,442 --> 00:46:45,942
- They have strong members. - They're strong.

1220
00:46:45,942 --> 00:46:47,042
I want to join that team.

1221
00:46:47,242 --> 00:46:49,182
They're strong. You never know.

1222
00:46:49,382 --> 00:46:51,112
However,

1223
00:46:51,112 --> 00:46:52,622
this is not the end.

1224
00:46:52,882 --> 00:46:54,782
As I said earlier,

1225
00:46:54,782 --> 00:46:56,852
the winners of each game will get hints about the bad girls...

1226
00:46:56,852 --> 00:46:59,762
and the chance to change partners.

1227
00:46:59,762 --> 00:47:03,162
(They get the chance to change partners.)

1228
00:47:04,162 --> 00:47:06,262
Soo Young has been quiet.

1229
00:47:06,262 --> 00:47:08,032
Yoon A has been quiet too.

1230
00:47:08,132 --> 00:47:10,172
I'll get hurt if Yoon A is a bad girl.

1231
00:47:10,172 --> 00:47:11,742
- I'm not. - A bad girl is quiet?

1232
00:47:11,942 --> 00:47:13,672
Soo Young is usually a good talker.

1233
00:47:13,672 --> 00:47:15,672
Are bad girls supposed to be quiet?

1234
00:47:15,672 --> 00:47:18,242
- Aren't they supposed to try hard? - No, I mean...

1235
00:47:18,382 --> 00:47:20,882
- Aren't they supposed to try hard? - No, I mean...

1236
00:47:21,412 --> 00:47:22,412
I'm sorry.

1237
00:47:22,712 --> 00:47:24,012
See?

1238
00:47:24,012 --> 00:47:25,482
Haha, you seem to be scolded a lot.

1239
00:47:26,782 --> 00:47:28,252
Don't be.

1240
00:47:28,352 --> 00:47:30,452
Don't say something meaningless.

1241
00:47:30,452 --> 00:47:32,162
Don't say something meaningless.

1242
00:47:32,362 --> 00:47:34,662
- Don't try to blame an innocent. - Okay.

1243
00:47:34,892 --> 00:47:36,432
She's unbelievable.

1244
00:47:37,192 --> 00:47:39,532
She's so attractive.

1245
00:47:39,702 --> 00:47:40,932
Soo Young...

1246
00:47:40,932 --> 00:47:42,432
I love the words she says.

1247
00:47:42,432 --> 00:47:44,172
Her attitude tells us she's the bad girl.

1248
00:47:45,172 --> 00:47:46,442
I love it.

1249
00:47:47,302 --> 00:47:48,842
Aren't you a little hungry?

1250
00:47:48,842 --> 00:47:49,912
- Yes. - Yes.

1251
00:47:49,912 --> 00:47:52,582
We've reserved two restaurants nearby.

1252
00:47:52,582 --> 00:47:54,242
(Braised spicy seafood and short rib patties.)

1253
00:47:54,242 --> 00:47:57,112
There are four cars parked outside,

1254
00:47:57,112 --> 00:47:58,822
and two couples will ride in each car.

1255
00:47:59,022 --> 00:48:02,192
But Team Singles will not share a car with the other teams.

1256
00:48:02,492 --> 00:48:06,262
You'll compete against a team that goes the same direction as you go.

1257
00:48:06,262 --> 00:48:08,162
You'll have to choose which team to share your car with carefully.

1258
00:48:08,162 --> 00:48:09,362
Okay.

1259
00:48:09,362 --> 00:48:10,832
Let's move now.

1260
00:48:10,832 --> 00:48:12,162
- Seok Jin! - What?

1261
00:48:12,162 --> 00:48:14,202
Let's go together.

1262
00:48:14,832 --> 00:48:16,972
- No, he's coming with us. - Come on.

1263
00:48:16,972 --> 00:48:18,272
- Hold on. - Goodness.

1264
00:48:18,272 --> 00:48:19,342
- No. - He's going with us.

1265
00:48:19,342 --> 00:48:21,602
Were you that easy to deal with?

1266
00:48:21,942 --> 00:48:24,612
It seems like everyone thinks you're easy.

1267
00:48:24,612 --> 00:48:27,442
- He's just popular. - Right, I am.

1268
00:48:27,942 --> 00:48:29,252
Go with me.

1269
00:48:29,712 --> 00:48:31,452
- Ji Hyo! - Okay?

1270
00:48:32,022 --> 00:48:33,382
Should we choose braised spicy seafood?

1271
00:48:33,522 --> 00:48:34,682
Let's go.

1272
00:48:34,682 --> 00:48:35,722
(Which teams will head to the same location?)

1273
00:48:35,722 --> 00:48:36,722
We must have meat.

1274
00:48:37,692 --> 00:48:39,362
I thought I would be a couple.

1275
00:48:39,422 --> 00:48:40,462
Me too.

1276
00:48:41,222 --> 00:48:42,932
Whom did you want to partner up with?

1277
00:48:43,332 --> 00:48:45,132
When we started our shooting,

1278
00:48:45,162 --> 00:48:47,702
I found Se Chan so funny.

1279
00:48:47,702 --> 00:48:49,932
The way he danced and everything.

1280
00:48:49,932 --> 00:48:52,172
- He's unexpectedly popular. - Really?

1281
00:48:52,372 --> 00:48:54,602
Did you have anyone you wanted to partner up with?

1282
00:48:54,902 --> 00:48:56,412
I...

1283
00:48:58,642 --> 00:49:03,012
(The member I wanted to partner up with was...)

1284
00:49:03,012 --> 00:49:06,722
I think it's so much better to do it alone.

1285
00:49:07,052 --> 00:49:09,852
(They're all the same anyway.)

1286
00:49:09,852 --> 00:49:12,292
- Team Singles. - I'm happy to be Team Singles.

1287
00:49:12,562 --> 00:49:15,292
You must not be a bad girl for certain then.

1288
00:49:16,392 --> 00:49:17,892
(That, I don't know.)

1289
00:49:18,162 --> 00:49:23,632
- Aren't you a bad girl? - No, I'm not.

1290
00:49:23,632 --> 00:49:26,902
(Perhaps, one of Running Man members is a bad girl.)

1291
00:49:26,902 --> 00:49:29,072
They never give me a crucial role.

1292
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:30,742
I see.

1293
00:49:30,972 --> 00:49:32,342
They're worried I mess it up.

1294
00:49:32,342 --> 00:49:34,212
I made a huge mistake last time.

1295
00:49:34,212 --> 00:49:36,752
(Is So Min the bad girl?)

1296
00:49:36,982 --> 00:49:38,982
- Hyo Yeon is suspicious. - Hyo Yeon.

1297
00:49:39,082 --> 00:49:41,022
- Sunny. - I think...

1298
00:49:41,352 --> 00:49:42,552
What do you think?

1299
00:49:42,852 --> 00:49:44,692
- I think it's Sunny. - Right?

1300
00:49:44,692 --> 00:49:47,522
- Sunny? - She tried really hard just before.

1301
00:49:47,522 --> 00:49:49,832
Sunny acted unusually cute.

1302
00:49:49,962 --> 00:49:52,562
She did act unusually cute.

1303
00:49:53,662 --> 00:49:54,832
(She has a point.)

1304
00:49:54,832 --> 00:49:57,332
She does seem suspicious.

1305
00:49:57,332 --> 00:49:58,502
Sunny...

1306
00:49:58,502 --> 00:49:59,572
(Is Sunny a bad girl?)

1307
00:49:59,572 --> 00:50:00,942
From what I saw today,

1308
00:50:00,942 --> 00:50:03,512
I think Tae Yeon, Hyo Yeon, and Sunny...

1309
00:50:03,512 --> 00:50:04,942
acted very unusual.

1310
00:50:04,942 --> 00:50:06,282
- Really? - They're suspicious.

1311
00:50:06,342 --> 00:50:09,052
All of them are going to where we're going.

1312
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:11,582
No, Sunny is going the other direction.

1313
00:50:11,582 --> 00:50:13,322
It's Tae Yeon, Hyo Yeon, and Soo Young.

1314
00:50:13,322 --> 00:50:15,192
No, it's Sunny.

1315
00:50:15,822 --> 00:50:17,522
Tiffany, Haha has decided...

1316
00:50:17,522 --> 00:50:19,722
that I'm the bad girl since yesterday.

1317
00:50:19,722 --> 00:50:21,992
To him, Soo Young is the bad girl for certain.

1318
00:50:21,992 --> 00:50:25,062
- It's been decided. - She's the bad girl.

1319
00:50:25,062 --> 00:50:27,062
It's been decided.

1320
00:50:27,202 --> 00:50:30,402
Her role is to cause confusion in her team.

1321
00:50:30,532 --> 00:50:32,972
Bad girls, you have to be thankful to me.

1322
00:50:32,972 --> 00:50:36,312
- I'm not sure who you are, - She's taken the role.

1323
00:50:36,312 --> 00:50:38,042
- but be thankful. - Right.

1324
00:50:38,042 --> 00:50:39,882
- Goodness. - He's sure about it.

1325
00:50:40,982 --> 00:50:44,052
Did you have anyone in mind whom you wanted to partner up with?

1326
00:50:44,052 --> 00:50:45,422
- Right. - That's important.

1327
00:50:46,182 --> 00:50:48,082
You had someone in mind?

1328
00:50:48,082 --> 00:50:49,722
I really wanted to partner up with Kwang Soo.

1329
00:50:49,722 --> 00:50:50,992
- Really? - Really.

1330
00:50:50,992 --> 00:50:52,862
(I really wanted to partner up with Kwang Soo.)

1331
00:50:53,122 --> 00:50:54,862
(Are you sure?)

1332
00:50:54,862 --> 00:50:56,292
- Really? - Really.

1333
00:50:56,462 --> 00:50:57,692
Tell me the reason.

1334
00:50:58,462 --> 00:51:00,262
You look great...

1335
00:51:00,662 --> 00:51:02,072
with that long hair.

1336
00:51:02,132 --> 00:51:05,272
- It's not easy to look great in it. - My long hair...

1337
00:51:05,842 --> 00:51:07,942
(Happy)

1338
00:51:07,942 --> 00:51:09,972
So you like men with long hair.

1339
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:11,842
- Ryoo Seung Bum has long hair. - Yoon A,

1340
00:51:12,212 --> 00:51:14,012
I can grow my hair to my bottom.

1341
00:51:14,412 --> 00:51:16,612
I can do that as long as you like it.

1342
00:51:16,612 --> 00:51:18,452
(Thank goodness I grew my hair.)

1343
00:51:19,322 --> 00:51:20,582
Give us an example.

1344
00:51:20,582 --> 00:51:22,952
Who do you think looks good with long hair?

1345
00:51:23,552 --> 00:51:25,792
Won Bin with long hair, for example.

1346
00:51:25,892 --> 00:51:28,532
Won Bin and Kwang Soo are way too different.

1347
00:51:28,532 --> 00:51:30,392
(It's like they're two different species.)

1348
00:51:30,392 --> 00:51:34,332
(So you just like handsome guys instead of long hair.)

1349
00:51:34,332 --> 00:51:36,272
- You're a bad girl, aren't you? - She must be.

1350
00:51:36,472 --> 00:51:39,002
(As soon as she mentions Won Bin, she is cornered as a bad girl.)

1351
00:51:39,002 --> 00:51:40,702
- I just thought of him. - Well...

1352
00:51:40,702 --> 00:51:42,972
- She's a total bad girl. - Goodness.

1353
00:51:43,172 --> 00:51:45,082
He's a fool to be deceived like this.

1354
00:51:45,082 --> 00:51:47,112
How can he fall in love this quickly?

1355
00:51:47,112 --> 00:51:48,582
What are you talking about? She meant it.

1356
00:51:48,582 --> 00:51:50,312
I wouldn't have partnered up with you...

1357
00:51:50,312 --> 00:51:52,752
- if I hadn't liked you. - Right, right.

1358
00:51:53,952 --> 00:51:55,752
You chose to have braised spicy seafood.

1359
00:51:55,752 --> 00:51:56,892
- Yes. - Yes.

1360
00:51:57,022 --> 00:51:58,662
Now, you'll play a game to acquire...

1361
00:51:58,662 --> 00:52:00,862
a hint, a chance to switch partners, and the food.

1362
00:52:00,862 --> 00:52:02,062
- What is it? - It's called 5 Seconds.

1363
00:52:02,062 --> 00:52:03,662
You'll play this game.

1364
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:07,202
You have to give 3 answers to a question in 5 seconds.

1365
00:52:07,202 --> 00:52:09,032
For example, the question is "What do you do before you go to bed?"

1366
00:52:09,032 --> 00:52:10,372
- You answer three things you do. - I see.

1367
00:52:10,372 --> 00:52:12,072
- You have to give three answers. - Got it.

1368
00:52:12,372 --> 00:52:14,972
A female member from each team will play.

1369
00:52:15,042 --> 00:52:17,842
The winning team will receive a hint and a chance to switch partners.

1370
00:52:18,412 --> 00:52:22,182
They'll also be given the main menu, braised spicy seafood.

1371
00:52:22,912 --> 00:52:25,322
The rest two teams will be given...

1372
00:52:25,322 --> 00:52:26,982
rice and dried laver.

1373
00:52:28,052 --> 00:52:29,792
- Okay. - It sounds hard.

1374
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:31,022
Is it just one question?

1375
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:33,062
Only the female members will play it, right?

1376
00:52:33,062 --> 00:52:34,122
- Right. - I see.

1377
00:52:34,822 --> 00:52:37,362
(Which team will win 5 Seconds?)

1378
00:52:38,092 --> 00:52:39,162
Ready.

1379
00:52:39,162 --> 00:52:41,062
(Yoon A will ask a question first.)

1380
00:52:41,062 --> 00:52:42,102
Go.

1381
00:52:43,272 --> 00:52:46,072
What do you do when you go to the toilet?

1382
00:52:46,272 --> 00:52:49,012
(What will be Ji Hyo's answers?)

1383
00:52:49,012 --> 00:52:50,512
I poop, wash up, and brush my teeth.

1384
00:52:50,512 --> 00:52:53,412
(I poop, wash up, and brush my teeth.)

1385
00:52:53,412 --> 00:52:54,442
(She's so straightforward.)

1386
00:52:54,442 --> 00:52:57,052
- Gosh, this... - You got this.

1387
00:52:57,352 --> 00:52:59,682
- Goodness. - They all do what you do.

1388
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:01,422
- Don't you agree? - Ji Hyo.

1389
00:53:01,422 --> 00:53:03,722
- Everyone poops. - Of course.

1390
00:53:03,892 --> 00:53:05,822
(Team Ji Hyo succeeds.)

1391
00:53:05,822 --> 00:53:06,892
Well...

1392
00:53:07,722 --> 00:53:10,332
When do you hate to see Kwang Soo's face?

1393
00:53:11,432 --> 00:53:15,702
When he eats, sleeps, and washes up.

1394
00:53:15,702 --> 00:53:16,772
(When do you hate to see Kwang Soo's face?)

1395
00:53:17,102 --> 00:53:18,342
When he sleeps?

1396
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:20,502
How do you know that?

1397
00:53:20,502 --> 00:53:22,042
(Did you just say when he sleeps?)

1398
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:25,982
(Shy)

1399
00:53:26,142 --> 00:53:27,442
When he sleeps?

1400
00:53:27,442 --> 00:53:29,012
Have you seen him sleep and wash up?

1401
00:53:29,152 --> 00:53:31,782
- When he washes up? - Goodness.

1402
00:53:31,782 --> 00:53:34,922
- Goodness. - When he sleeps and washes up.

1403
00:53:35,392 --> 00:53:37,152
- She said it so suddenly. - Kwang Soo.

1404
00:53:37,722 --> 00:53:40,322
- Kwang Soo. - When did you see me wash?

1405
00:53:40,322 --> 00:53:43,032
(He's so shy.)

1406
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,232
Even my mom didn't get to see it yet.

1407
00:53:45,232 --> 00:53:47,062
- By the way... - When he washes up.

1408
00:53:47,062 --> 00:53:48,732
(Yoon A and Kwang Soo succeed as well.)

1409
00:53:49,702 --> 00:53:50,802
Let's go with something silly.

1410
00:53:50,932 --> 00:53:54,572
Give me three reasons why you hate the producer of Running Man.

1411
00:53:54,572 --> 00:53:56,872
(Three reasons why she hates the producer of Running Man)

1412
00:53:56,872 --> 00:53:58,942
He's ugly, talkative, and annoying.

1413
00:54:01,952 --> 00:54:05,582
(The producer is ugly, talkative, and annoying.)

1414
00:54:05,582 --> 00:54:07,652
(She was in a hurry, and said her real opinions about him.)

1415
00:54:07,652 --> 00:54:10,192
I'm sure this is what she really thinks.

1416
00:54:10,952 --> 00:54:12,962
- Poor Chul Min. - Goodness.

1417
00:54:12,962 --> 00:54:14,222
(I just said whatever came to my mind.)

1418
00:54:14,222 --> 00:54:16,632
Good job, Ji Hyo. Good job.

1419
00:54:16,632 --> 00:54:19,432
He placed 128th among all the staff members for his looks.

1420
00:54:19,432 --> 00:54:21,002
- He placed 128th? - Yes.

1421
00:54:21,332 --> 00:54:23,202
- Isn't that the last? - 128th.

1422
00:54:23,202 --> 00:54:25,002
- He isn't within the 101 members. - No, he isn't.

1423
00:54:25,002 --> 00:54:27,102
He can't be 1 of the 101 members.

1424
00:54:27,102 --> 00:54:29,812
(We can't show you his front side due to his appearance rank.)

1425
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:31,272
What do you think...

1426
00:54:33,182 --> 00:54:35,182
Kwang Soo was in his past life?

1427
00:54:35,452 --> 00:54:37,852
Goblin, beggar,

1428
00:54:37,852 --> 00:54:39,582
and... Wait.

1429
00:54:39,582 --> 00:54:41,022
Yes!

1430
00:54:41,452 --> 00:54:44,392
(Goblin, beggar,)

1431
00:54:44,392 --> 00:54:46,562
(and something unknown)

1432
00:54:46,562 --> 00:54:48,022
She said beggar.

1433
00:54:48,192 --> 00:54:50,932
A beggar with long hair. Gosh, you beggar.

1434
00:54:51,492 --> 00:54:53,302
A beggar with this kind of hair.

1435
00:54:53,962 --> 00:54:55,732
Beggar.

1436
00:54:56,102 --> 00:54:58,172
- Beggar... - Beggar...

1437
00:54:58,172 --> 00:54:59,842
Didn't you say you liked my hair?

1438
00:54:59,842 --> 00:55:01,672
(Didn't you say you liked my hair?)

1439
00:55:02,142 --> 00:55:05,282
Now, you'll play a game to acquire...

1440
00:55:05,542 --> 00:55:09,212
a hint, a chance to switch partners, and the food.

1441
00:55:09,482 --> 00:55:12,052
- You'll play Yu Jae Seok's Game. - Okay.

1442
00:55:12,452 --> 00:55:13,852
- Tiffany. - What is that?

1443
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:14,922
You have to give random answers.

1444
00:55:14,922 --> 00:55:18,892
A female member of each team will play the game.

1445
00:55:19,622 --> 00:55:20,992
The winning team will receive...

1446
00:55:20,992 --> 00:55:23,662
a hint and a chance to switch partners.

1447
00:55:23,792 --> 00:55:26,062
They'll also be given the main menu, grilled short rib patties.

1448
00:55:26,402 --> 00:55:28,572
- You can do it! - Okay.

1449
00:55:28,572 --> 00:55:30,232
(Tae Yeon versus Soo Young)

1450
00:55:30,232 --> 00:55:31,742
- Let's go. - Start.

1451
00:55:32,302 --> 00:55:33,372
Whom do you respect the most?

1452
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:34,442
I'm so hot.

1453
00:55:34,442 --> 00:55:35,842
What do you want to have for your birthday gift?

1454
00:55:35,842 --> 00:55:37,112
You have a very big nose.

1455
00:55:37,112 --> 00:55:38,512
How do you release your stress?

1456
00:55:38,512 --> 00:55:40,712
Poop color.

1457
00:55:41,112 --> 00:55:43,352
(Why did she have to mention someone else's nose?)

1458
00:55:43,352 --> 00:55:45,282
All right, next.

1459
00:55:45,682 --> 00:55:47,152
What's wrong with you?

1460
00:55:47,352 --> 00:55:48,792
It's only a game, so why are you sulky?

1461
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:52,362
She only said your nose was big. Why are you sulky?

1462
00:55:52,422 --> 00:55:53,662
- Is it because of me? - Yes.

1463
00:55:54,222 --> 00:55:55,462
I'm sorry.

1464
00:55:57,292 --> 00:55:58,532
(His mind isn't as broad as his nose.)

1465
00:55:58,532 --> 00:55:59,962
You're handsome.

1466
00:56:00,532 --> 00:56:01,562
Awesome.

1467
00:56:01,562 --> 00:56:03,002
It's Tae Yeon's turn now.

1468
00:56:03,002 --> 00:56:04,072
(Soo Young succeeds.)

1469
00:56:05,242 --> 00:56:06,242
Let's go.

1470
00:56:06,772 --> 00:56:07,802
What's your nickname?

1471
00:56:07,802 --> 00:56:08,942
It's too hot.

1472
00:56:08,942 --> 00:56:10,242
What does Kwang Soo mean to you?

1473
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:11,842
Handmade acorn jelly.

1474
00:56:11,842 --> 00:56:13,482
(Handmade acorn jelly)

1475
00:56:13,482 --> 00:56:18,052
(Kwang Soo is handmade acorn jelly.)

1476
00:56:18,052 --> 00:56:21,852
(They didn't know there was a menu like Kwang Soo until now.)

1477
00:56:22,152 --> 00:56:23,522
They won.

1478
00:56:23,522 --> 00:56:25,792
This completely makes sense.

1479
00:56:25,792 --> 00:56:27,262
- We won. - Perfect.

1480
00:56:27,262 --> 00:56:28,432
They won.

1481
00:56:28,432 --> 00:56:32,562
- Why? - Kwang Soo is handmade acorn jelly.

1482
00:56:33,232 --> 00:56:34,862
Gosh, the rice is yellow.

1483
00:56:34,972 --> 00:56:36,372
Because it's turmeric rice.

1484
00:56:36,372 --> 00:56:38,172
(Only the winning team gets to taste the main dishes.)

1485
00:56:38,172 --> 00:56:39,972
This tastes interesting.

1486
00:56:40,572 --> 00:56:42,172
(They enjoy the dishes.)

1487
00:56:43,772 --> 00:56:44,942
It's good.

1488
00:56:44,942 --> 00:56:46,012
(They try not to get envious.)

1489
00:56:46,012 --> 00:56:47,412
What are they eating?

1490
00:56:47,882 --> 00:56:50,652
(The grilled short rib patties are delicious,)

1491
00:56:50,652 --> 00:56:54,552
(but the braised spicy seafood is delicious too.)

1492
00:56:54,822 --> 00:56:56,452
(Team Ji Hyo is the winning team.)

1493
00:56:56,452 --> 00:56:57,722
Gosh, this abalone.

1494
00:56:58,522 --> 00:57:01,762
- It looks so tasty. - Right? It looks so good.

1495
00:57:02,292 --> 00:57:03,432
(Whispering)

1496
00:57:03,432 --> 00:57:04,432
Is that octopus?

1497
00:57:04,432 --> 00:57:05,862
- Yes. - Yes, it's octopus.

1498
00:57:07,302 --> 00:57:08,332
Look.

1499
00:57:09,002 --> 00:57:11,602
Yu Ri prepared something.

1500
00:57:11,602 --> 00:57:13,542
- What is it? - Take a look.

1501
00:57:13,842 --> 00:57:16,342
Could you please share some of it with us?

1502
00:57:17,442 --> 00:57:20,182
(It's Fools' Generation.)

1503
00:57:21,412 --> 00:57:22,612
That's not good enough.

1504
00:57:22,612 --> 00:57:23,652
What?

1505
00:57:24,052 --> 00:57:27,182
(It's not acceptable if it doesn't meet his standard.)

1506
00:57:27,182 --> 00:57:28,652
(Seok Jin said it'd work.)

1507
00:57:28,652 --> 00:57:31,392
- She's a Girls' Generation member. - What happened?

1508
00:57:31,622 --> 00:57:33,022
(Laughing)

1509
00:57:33,562 --> 00:57:34,622
What are you doing, Yoon A?

1510
00:57:34,622 --> 00:57:37,732
(Yoon A prepares something.)

1511
00:57:38,862 --> 00:57:40,632
She'll be the female version of Se Chan.

1512
00:57:41,032 --> 00:57:42,102
Female version?

1513
00:57:42,102 --> 00:57:43,702
(Will she turn into Se Chan?)

1514
00:57:46,372 --> 00:57:48,812
Give me some braised spicy seafood right now.

1515
00:57:49,272 --> 00:57:52,912
(Yoon A shows her unexpected charm.)

1516
00:57:53,412 --> 00:57:55,712
(Even Se Chan enjoys her imitation of himself.)

1517
00:57:56,712 --> 00:57:58,922
(It's 22-year-old Se Chan.)

1518
00:57:58,922 --> 00:58:02,392
(He acted as a father on "People Looking for Laughter".)

1519
00:58:02,392 --> 00:58:03,592
Give me some braised spicy seafood.

1520
00:58:04,222 --> 00:58:05,692
Give me some now.

1521
00:58:06,292 --> 00:58:07,492
(He's very content.)

1522
00:58:07,492 --> 00:58:09,492
- "Give it to me now." - "Give it to me."

1523
00:58:09,592 --> 00:58:10,592
"Give it to me now."

1524
00:58:10,792 --> 00:58:13,032
(Their fun lunchtime is over.)

1525
00:58:13,762 --> 00:58:17,432
Jae Seok and Ji Hyo came first place.

1526
00:58:18,102 --> 00:58:20,572
- Here's a hint for you. - Thank you.

1527
00:58:20,572 --> 00:58:22,812
(They get a hint about the bad girls.)

1528
00:58:22,812 --> 00:58:24,112
That's very important.

1529
00:58:24,912 --> 00:58:26,312
(They take a look at the hint.)

1530
00:58:27,082 --> 00:58:29,112
Take a look at the hint.

1531
00:58:29,212 --> 00:58:31,822
Jae Seok will decide whether to exchange partners or not.

1532
00:58:32,322 --> 00:58:34,322
Will you exchange your partner?

1533
00:58:34,752 --> 00:58:36,652
Does it say who they are?

1534
00:58:36,652 --> 00:58:38,692
Is the hint too general?

1535
00:58:38,692 --> 00:58:40,822
- No, it's pretty specific. - Really?

1536
00:58:41,292 --> 00:58:43,962
I had no idea before reading this hint.

1537
00:58:44,232 --> 00:58:46,532
I have to exchange partners.

1538
00:58:46,532 --> 00:58:47,862
(He decides to exchange partners.)

1539
00:58:47,862 --> 00:58:48,932
You read it too, Ji Hyo.

1540
00:58:48,932 --> 00:58:51,232
- Really? - Come on.

1541
00:58:51,372 --> 00:58:52,472
May I say the answer?

1542
00:58:52,472 --> 00:58:53,742
With whom will you exchange?

1543
00:58:53,742 --> 00:58:54,772
I will...

1544
00:58:55,112 --> 00:58:58,172
If he's partnered with a bad girl, he'll be punished.

1545
00:58:58,282 --> 00:59:01,042
(Whom will Jae Seok choose?)

1546
00:59:01,042 --> 00:59:02,052
I choose Sunny.

1547
00:59:02,612 --> 00:59:04,182
Why? Isn't she a bad girl?

1548
00:59:04,782 --> 00:59:07,822
(Is Sunny not a bad girl?)

1549
00:59:07,822 --> 00:59:09,222
- Why not? - What?

1550
00:59:09,222 --> 00:59:10,592
Isn't Sunny a bad girl?

1551
00:59:10,592 --> 00:59:12,292
We thought Sunny was a bad girl.

1552
00:59:12,292 --> 00:59:14,422
- We thought so. - I'm innocent.

1553
00:59:14,422 --> 00:59:15,432
I had no idea.

1554
00:59:16,703 --> 00:59:22,013
(Bad girls were born in Korea. Sunny and Tiffany were born in the US.)

1555
00:59:22,854 --> 00:59:23,884
Haha,

1556
00:59:24,714 --> 00:59:26,684
will you exchange partners?

1557
00:59:26,884 --> 00:59:27,884
Yes.

1558
00:59:27,884 --> 00:59:30,894
(Haha changes his partner since Soo Young was born in Korea.)

1559
00:59:32,294 --> 00:59:34,164
I choose Tiffany.

1560
00:59:34,494 --> 00:59:35,494
Me?

1561
00:59:35,894 --> 00:59:36,894
I'm sorry.

1562
00:59:36,894 --> 00:59:38,434
(She's very happy.)

1563
00:59:39,064 --> 00:59:41,534
It's bad to be partnered up with Soo Young.

1564
00:59:41,534 --> 00:59:42,534
What's wrong with me?

1565
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:45,444
- Here's some information. - Don't share any information.

1566
00:59:45,474 --> 00:59:49,814
(What information is he about to share?)

1567
00:59:49,814 --> 00:59:50,874
Don't say anything.

1568
00:59:50,874 --> 00:59:52,144
- It says... - No.

1569
00:59:53,084 --> 00:59:54,644
"Soo Young is a bad girl."

1570
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:58,084
(Soo Young is a bad girl no matter what.)

1571
00:59:58,084 --> 01:00:00,454
- Bad girls are alive. - Is she that bad?

1572
01:00:01,054 --> 01:00:03,824
I told you not to blame an innocent, didn't I?

1573
01:00:04,924 --> 01:00:06,794
I told you not to say anything meaningless.

1574
01:00:07,994 --> 01:00:08,964
Therefore...

1575
01:00:08,964 --> 01:00:10,834
(Tiffany looks at So Min.)

1576
01:00:10,834 --> 01:00:12,564
You seem like a bad girl.

1577
01:00:12,664 --> 01:00:14,864
That's also possible.

1578
01:00:14,864 --> 01:00:17,104
I heard what she said in the car.

1579
01:00:17,104 --> 01:00:18,104
What did she say?

1580
01:00:18,434 --> 01:00:21,004
(What did she notice about So Min?)

1581
01:00:21,004 --> 01:00:24,974
(It could be a determining factor.)

1582
01:00:27,444 --> 01:00:29,484
She really wants to be a bad girl.

1583
01:00:31,254 --> 01:00:35,284
(She wants to be in the center of attention.)

1584
01:00:35,284 --> 01:00:37,094
- That's right. - That's what I felt.

1585
01:00:37,094 --> 01:00:38,594
Are you serious?

1586
01:00:38,594 --> 01:00:41,894
She always wants to be the cause of a conflict.

1587
01:00:41,894 --> 01:00:43,464
(Let me be in the center of attention.)

1588
01:00:44,834 --> 01:00:47,264
She's such a genius.

1589
01:00:47,264 --> 01:00:48,434
She's wise.

1590
01:00:48,734 --> 01:00:49,934
- She's a narrator. - She's amazing.

1591

01:00:52,344 --> 01:00:56,444
You changed your partner to Tiffany after reading the hint.

1593
01:00:56,974 --> 01:00:59,244
Sunny and Tiffany aren't bad girls...

1594
01:00:59,244 --> 01:01:00,344
- based on the hint. - Shall we sit here?

1595
01:01:00,484 --> 01:01:01,544
Okay.

1596
01:01:01,544 --> 01:01:03,114
- 2, 3. - Let's sit here.

1597
01:01:03,114 --> 01:01:05,014
- Have a seat. - I want to fight.

1598
01:01:05,014 --> 01:01:06,384
- Sit down. - Come here.

1599
01:01:06,384 --> 01:01:08,124
Please take a seat.

1600
01:01:08,124 --> 01:01:09,454
- Okay. - Where should we sit?

1601
01:01:09,454 --> 01:01:10,454
(They take a seat.)

1602
01:01:10,454 --> 01:01:12,694
One sitting mat is missing. Take a seat anywhere.

1603
01:01:12,694 --> 01:01:16,894
- What did he say? - It's Tae Yeon.

1604
01:01:16,894 --> 01:01:19,164
It has to be in the right form.

1605
01:01:19,964 --> 01:01:22,204
Tae Yeon doesn't have a sitting mat.

1606
01:01:22,474 --> 01:01:23,474
You're the tagger.

1607
01:01:24,004 --> 01:01:26,774
(She's the tagger?)

1608
01:01:26,774 --> 01:01:28,244
(What on earth?)

1609
01:01:28,674 --> 01:01:30,374
She's the tagger.

1610
01:01:31,474 --> 01:01:33,414
- Stand in the center. - This is fun.

1611
01:01:33,844 --> 01:01:35,044
I'm flustered.

1612
01:01:35,384 --> 01:01:36,384
Is it a talent show?

1613
01:01:36,384 --> 01:01:37,384
(What kind of a game is it?)

1614
01:01:37,654 --> 01:01:41,724
This mission is called Run Devil Run.

1615
01:01:41,984 --> 01:01:43,994
(Run Devil Run?)

1616
01:01:45,024 --> 01:01:48,764
(She has to steal a seat.)

1617
01:01:49,294 --> 01:01:53,004
All the members except the tagger stay seated on the mats.

1618
01:01:53,004 --> 01:01:56,904
Of the numbered mats, there are three red mats.

1619
01:01:56,974 --> 01:02:00,404
Those sitting on the red mat when the game ends...

1620
01:02:00,574 --> 01:02:02,674
will receive a hint and an Exchange Card.

1621
01:02:02,674 --> 01:02:04,644
(If you're on the red mat, you get a hint and Exchange Card.)

1622
01:02:04,644 --> 01:02:05,884
You can exchange partners?

1623
01:02:05,884 --> 01:02:06,884
It's the red mat.

1624
01:02:06,884 --> 01:02:08,984
(Only three members get a hint and an Exchange Card.)

1625
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:13,554
The tagger will be asked, "Which partner do you like?"

1626
01:02:13,554 --> 01:02:16,894
If the tagger says, "I like partners with glasses",

1627
01:02:16,894 --> 01:02:18,594
- those wearing glasses... - I must stand up.

1628
01:02:18,624 --> 01:02:20,464
must run and grab a toy.

1629
01:02:20,464 --> 01:02:21,964
- Grab a toy. - Then return to your seat.

1630
01:02:22,034 --> 01:02:24,164
Tae Yeon, as soon as you answer the question,

1631
01:02:24,164 --> 01:02:25,704
take an empty seat.

1632
01:02:25,704 --> 01:02:27,934
Every time you're a tagger,

1633
01:02:27,934 --> 01:02:30,234
you'll get a mark on your face.

1634
01:02:30,474 --> 01:02:31,734
The tagger before you will mark the face.

1635
01:02:31,734 --> 01:02:34,274
I'll do it for Tae Yeon since she's the first tagger.

1636
01:02:35,004 --> 01:02:37,174
Make a mark on her nose.

1637
01:02:37,274 --> 01:02:39,284
Put it next to her lips.

1638
01:02:39,844 --> 01:02:41,744
- Put a mark. - That's it.

1639
01:02:41,744 --> 01:02:42,914
- It's so hot. - It's hot.

1640
01:02:42,914 --> 01:02:45,354
(I'll destroy whomever I catch next.)

1641
01:02:48,454 --> 01:02:49,724
(I don't want to be a tagger.)

1642
01:02:49,854 --> 01:02:51,354
Let's start Round One.

1643
01:02:51,554 --> 01:02:52,564
Get ready.

1644
01:02:52,864 --> 01:02:54,094
Start.

1645
01:02:54,264 --> 01:02:58,194
- Which partner do you like? - Which partner do you like?

1646
01:02:58,364 --> 01:02:59,404
I like...

1647
01:02:59,704 --> 01:03:02,734
partners wearing black microphones.

1648
01:03:02,774 --> 01:03:04,604
(A black microphone?)

1649
01:03:04,604 --> 01:03:05,974
(That's me.)

1650
01:03:05,974 --> 01:03:07,574
"Partners wearing black microphones"?

1651
01:03:07,574 --> 01:03:09,474
My goodness. It's all of us.

1652
01:03:09,874 --> 01:03:11,274
(Tae Yeon runs to a sitting mat.)

1653
01:03:11,274 --> 01:03:13,484
You're the tagger.

1654
01:03:13,544 --> 01:03:15,354
What happened?

1655
01:03:15,814 --> 01:03:17,684
(Seok Jin is the tagger.)

1656
01:03:17,684 --> 01:03:19,624
Tae Yeon, mark him properly.

1657
01:03:19,624 --> 01:03:21,284
- Okay. - It's a nice mark.

1658
01:03:21,284 --> 01:03:22,494
That's too nice.

1659
01:03:22,494 --> 01:03:25,154
- Tae Yeon is too kind. - He looks like Rudolph.

1660
01:03:25,394 --> 01:03:26,694
- Look. - This isn't nice.

1661
01:03:26,694 --> 01:03:28,094
(He's angry.)

1662
01:03:28,094 --> 01:03:29,594
(Seok Jin turns into Rudolph.)

1663
01:03:30,064 --> 01:03:34,334
- Which partner do you like, So Min? - Which partner do you like, So Min?

1664
01:03:34,334 --> 01:03:35,334
Look at the front.

1665
01:03:35,334 --> 01:03:38,104
I like partners with green ties.

1666
01:03:38,474 --> 01:03:41,074
(Her eyebrows are connected across her forehead.)

1667
01:03:42,174 --> 01:03:44,914
- What are you doing? - Look at Sunny's face.

1668
01:03:44,914 --> 01:03:45,984
(She drew on her face.)

1669
01:03:45,984 --> 01:03:47,084
My goodness.

1670
01:03:47,084 --> 01:03:48,114
She looks good.

1671
01:03:48,114 --> 01:03:49,554
You look good, So Min.

1672
01:03:49,554 --> 01:03:52,024
(People go far in their revenge.)

1673
01:03:52,624 --> 01:03:54,284
(I like partners with green ties.)

1674
01:03:54,284 --> 01:03:55,824
- What did she say? - What?

1675
01:03:56,594 --> 01:03:57,754
Get out of the way.

1676
01:03:57,754 --> 01:03:59,664
(He catches So Min,)

1677
01:03:59,664 --> 01:04:01,694
(and nails her to the ground.)

1678
01:04:01,694 --> 01:04:04,194
- How could you? - Goodness.

1679
01:04:04,634 --> 01:04:05,664
Hey.

1680
01:04:05,664 --> 01:04:07,764
(He still ends up being the tagger.)

1681
01:04:07,764 --> 01:04:08,934
It's Kwang Soo.

1682
01:04:10,804 --> 01:04:13,804
Kwang Soo needs a pair of sunglasses for the summer.

1683
01:04:13,804 --> 01:04:15,844
Kwang Soo has many moles on his face.

1684
01:04:15,844 --> 01:04:17,074
Connect all of them.

1685
01:04:17,074 --> 01:04:19,444
(Simple as that.)

1686
01:04:19,584 --> 01:04:20,714
Connect all of his moles.

1687
01:04:21,084 --> 01:04:23,754
- You'll find a constellation. - Are you serious?

1688
01:04:23,754 --> 01:04:24,784
Connect them.

1689
01:04:25,014 --> 01:04:26,184
She's connecting his moles.

1690
01:04:26,184 --> 01:04:27,454
(It's a game of connecting dots.)

1691
01:04:27,454 --> 01:04:29,394
It looks amazing.

1692
01:04:29,494 --> 01:04:30,554
It's amazing.

1693
01:04:31,254 --> 01:04:35,224
Kwang Soo, you look like Johnny Depp dressed as a pirate.

1694
01:04:35,224 --> 01:04:38,364
(He doesn't look like him at all.)

1695
01:04:38,364 --> 01:04:39,464
(He's humiliated.)

1696
01:04:39,464 --> 01:04:41,034
"Johnny Depp"?

1697
01:04:42,004 --> 01:04:44,604
- "Johnny Depp"? - This is the final round.

1698
01:04:44,874 --> 01:04:45,874
(It's their last chance.)

1699
01:04:45,874 --> 01:04:47,074
This is the final round.

1700
01:04:47,074 --> 01:04:48,074
It's the final.

1701
01:04:48,074 --> 01:04:49,074
(It's their last chance.)

1702
01:04:49,714 --> 01:04:53,484
- Which partner do you like? - Which partner do you like?

1703
01:04:54,084 --> 01:04:59,124
I like partners who weigh over 40kg.

1704
01:04:59,124 --> 01:05:00,284
Goodness.

1705
01:05:00,284 --> 01:05:03,494
(Kwang Soo runs toward the mats.)

1706
01:05:03,494 --> 01:05:05,594
(He takes a blue sitting mat.)

1707
01:05:05,594 --> 01:05:07,024
Where?

1708
01:05:07,024 --> 01:05:08,024
Where?

1709
01:05:08,024 --> 01:05:10,334
(Se Chan takes a red mat.)

1710
01:05:11,834 --> 01:05:13,264
- Sit here. - I won't sit here.

1711
01:05:14,004 --> 01:05:15,374
I have no idea.

1712
01:05:15,374 --> 01:05:17,634
(Instead of Yoon A, Hyo Yeon takes a red mat.)

1713
01:05:18,534 --> 01:05:20,974
(Haha also takes a red mat.)

1714
01:05:21,604 --> 01:05:22,874
I have no idea.

1715
01:05:23,614 --> 01:05:24,844
Are you okay?

1716
01:05:24,844 --> 01:05:25,884
I'm okay.

1717
01:05:25,884 --> 01:05:27,614
(Run Devil Run is over.)

1718
01:05:27,614 --> 01:05:28,954
- I dropped it. - Raise your hand...

1719
01:05:28,954 --> 01:05:30,284
if you're on a red mat.

1720
01:05:30,354 --> 01:05:31,384
Yes!

1721
01:05:31,914 --> 01:05:32,924
Please stand up.

1722
01:05:32,924 --> 01:05:34,454
- Okay. - How did they take it?

1723
01:05:34,454 --> 01:05:35,994
I want to read the hint.

1724
01:05:36,124 --> 01:05:37,324
Let's see.

1725
01:05:38,194 --> 01:05:40,124
She seems very anxious.

1726
01:05:40,124 --> 01:05:41,124
(Hyo Yeon seems worried as she reads the hint.)

1727
01:05:41,124 --> 01:05:43,094
Hyo Yeon, whom will you choose...

1728
01:05:43,294 --> 01:05:44,334
to be your partner?

1729
01:05:44,464 --> 01:05:46,364
She should be partners with a bad girl since...

1730
01:05:46,364 --> 01:05:48,164
bad girls should be on Team Singles.

1731
01:05:48,164 --> 01:05:49,734
- Right. - I choose...

1732
01:05:50,674 --> 01:05:53,174
(Whom will Hyo Yeon choose?)

1733
01:05:53,174 --> 01:05:54,174
Yoon A.

1734
01:05:54,444 --> 01:05:55,874
- Is she a bad girl? - Who's her partner?

1735
01:05:55,874 --> 01:05:56,914
- Is she a bad girl? - What's going on?

1736
01:05:56,914 --> 01:05:58,444
Shall we ask if she thinks Yoon A is a bad girl...

1737
01:05:58,444 --> 01:06:00,384
or if she simply likes Yoon A's partner?

1738
01:06:00,844 --> 01:06:03,984
(He's suddenly interested in Hyo Yeon's choice.)

1739
01:06:04,714 --> 01:06:06,054
- Which one is it? - Kwang Soo.

1740
01:06:06,124 --> 01:06:07,854
I want to know the reason.

1741
01:06:07,854 --> 01:06:09,524
Is that important?

1742
01:06:10,924 --> 01:06:14,664
(He said he'd grow his hair down to his bottom.)

1743
01:06:14,664 --> 01:06:18,864
(He said he'd gobble up the hint that could make Yoon A suspicious.)

1744
01:06:18,864 --> 01:06:20,164
(Yoon A is betrayed.)

1745
01:06:20,164 --> 01:06:21,804
Why did she exchange with Yoon A?

1746
01:06:21,804 --> 01:06:23,234
(Hyo Yeon and Kwang Soo are a team.)

1747
01:06:23,704 --> 01:06:25,034
Why was it with Yoon A?

1748
01:06:25,034 --> 01:06:26,374
- It's my turn. - Look at the hint.

1749
01:06:26,374 --> 01:06:27,544
(It's Se Chan's turn to look at the hint.)

1750
01:06:27,544 --> 01:06:31,674
(Why was Yoon A sent to Team Singles?)

1751
01:06:31,674 --> 01:06:34,884
(Bad girls do not have a stage name.)

1752
01:06:34,884 --> 01:06:38,384
(So Min, Tae Yeon, Yoon A, Soo Young, Yu Ri, Hyo Yeon)

1753
01:06:38,724 --> 01:06:41,654
(There are six members who do not have stage names.)

1754
01:06:42,654 --> 01:06:45,464
(Ji Hyo is eliminated.)

1755
01:06:45,464 --> 01:06:48,264
I'd like Ji Hyo...

1756
01:06:48,264 --> 01:06:51,664
(However)

1757
01:06:51,664 --> 01:06:53,634
I'd like Ji Hyo to switch places with Sunny.

1758
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:54,804
(He chooses Sunny again.)

1759
01:06:54,804 --> 01:06:57,304
Is Sunny a safe one?

1760
01:06:57,734 --> 01:06:59,644
- Sunny must be a safe one. - Exactly.

1761
01:06:59,644 --> 01:07:02,014
- She's a safe one. - She must not be a bad girl.

1762
01:07:02,814 --> 01:07:04,044
- I'm scared. - Yoon A.

1763
01:07:04,044 --> 01:07:06,284
I'd like Tiffany...

1764
01:07:06,484 --> 01:07:07,614
You're a bad girl.

1765
01:07:07,614 --> 01:07:09,884
(Haha's partner, Tiffany, is not a bad girl.)

1766
01:07:09,884 --> 01:07:11,014
I'd like Tiffany to switch places with Sunny.

1767
01:07:11,914 --> 01:07:13,524
- What? - That's funny.

1768
01:07:13,984 --> 01:07:15,554
(Se Chan became partners with Sunny 30 seconds ago.)

1769
01:07:15,554 --> 01:07:16,794
What?

1770
01:07:16,794 --> 01:07:18,024
(I will kill you.)

1771
01:07:18,024 --> 01:07:21,224
It's been just 30 seconds.

1772
01:07:21,224 --> 01:07:22,334
(Partners)

1773
01:07:22,334 --> 01:07:24,094
It makes no difference.

1774
01:07:24,094 --> 01:07:25,734
(Partners)

1775
01:07:26,634 --> 01:07:27,804
(The final race)

1776
01:07:27,804 --> 01:07:30,234
- They're Team Singles. - Team Singles.

1777
01:07:30,604 --> 01:07:32,444
Yoon A is on Team Singles.

1778
01:07:32,444 --> 01:07:34,444
I wasn't expecting this.

1779
01:07:34,904 --> 01:07:36,544
The members have changed.

1780
01:07:36,544 --> 01:07:38,914
Let me announce the final mission.

1781
01:07:39,384 --> 01:07:42,284
It's called I Got a Boy Race.

1782
01:07:42,284 --> 01:07:44,784
(I Got a Boy Race)

1783
01:07:44,784 --> 01:07:46,024
(I got a boy?)

1784
01:07:46,024 --> 01:07:47,084
It's a race.

1785
01:07:47,084 --> 01:07:48,924
- I got a handsome boy - It's a nice name.

1786
01:07:48,924 --> 01:07:50,454
I got a nice boy

1787
01:07:51,594 --> 01:07:53,724
The race will start soon.

1788
01:07:53,724 --> 01:07:57,334
Find the hidden hints within 30 minutes,

1789
01:07:57,334 --> 01:07:59,464
and arrest the three bad girls.

1790
01:08:00,164 --> 01:08:01,834
If two or more bad girls get arrested,

1791
01:08:01,834 --> 01:08:04,274
Team Partners will win.

1792
01:08:04,674 --> 01:08:06,844
If not, Team Bad Girls will win.

1793
01:08:06,844 --> 01:08:08,814
The losing team will get an ice shower.

1794
01:08:08,814 --> 01:08:16,384
(The losing team will get an ice shower.)

1795
01:08:18,484 --> 01:08:21,024
Bad girls can be arrested through a vote.

1796
01:08:21,024 --> 01:08:22,194
Through a vote?

1797
01:08:22,194 --> 01:08:24,054
After the race,

1798
01:08:24,054 --> 01:08:26,324
Team Partners will get two voting rights per team.

1799
01:08:26,324 --> 01:08:28,834
Team Singles won't be given the right to vote.

1800
01:08:28,834 --> 01:08:30,064
We don't?

1801
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,594
We don't.

1802
01:08:31,794 --> 01:08:33,164
Once the race starts,

1803
01:08:33,664 --> 01:08:36,974
Team Partners have to wear couple bracelets.

1804
01:08:37,104 --> 01:08:39,304
Team Singles can take someone's place...

1805
01:08:39,304 --> 01:08:40,604
by cutting her bracelet.

1806
01:08:40,604 --> 01:08:43,174
(Team Singles can take someone's place by cutting a bracelet.)

1807
01:08:43,174 --> 01:08:44,314
The three of them?

1808
01:08:45,174 --> 01:08:48,514
Team Singles will, of course, try to attack Team Partners.

1809
01:08:48,644 --> 01:08:51,354
Team Partners can stop their attack...

1810
01:08:51,514 --> 01:08:53,584
by eliminating their name tags,

1811
01:08:53,684 --> 01:08:56,554
which will force them to dance at the spot for a minute.

1812
01:08:56,554 --> 01:08:59,364
(They have to dance at the spot for a minute.)

1813
01:08:59,364 --> 01:09:00,994
(Dance?)

1814
01:09:00,994 --> 01:09:03,064
That's too harsh.

1815
01:09:03,064 --> 01:09:05,234
- I got a boy - That's too harsh.

1816
01:09:05,234 --> 01:09:06,404
(Like this)

1817
01:09:06,764 --> 01:09:09,004
If any of the guys become partners with a bad girl...

1818
01:09:09,634 --> 01:09:13,604
more than twice, he'll lose the right to vote.

1819
01:09:13,604 --> 01:09:17,814
(They'll lose the right to vote.)

1820
01:09:17,814 --> 01:09:20,244
If you become partners with a bad girl more than twice?

1821
01:09:20,944 --> 01:09:23,284
But if you become partners with the boss...

1822
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:26,584
of Team Bad Girls even once, you'll lose your right to vote.

1823
01:09:26,584 --> 01:09:27,984
(Becoming partners with the boss will take away the right to vote.)

1824
01:09:27,984 --> 01:09:29,794
I'll announce who has lost the right to vote...

1825
01:09:29,794 --> 01:09:32,924
one minute before the race ends.

1826
01:09:35,224 --> 01:09:37,834
Let's say my partner already is a bad girl, and I become partners...

1827
01:09:37,934 --> 01:09:39,734
with another bad girl. Will that take away my right to vote?

1828
01:09:39,734 --> 01:09:41,204
Yes, it will.

1829
01:09:41,434 --> 01:09:42,904
But I'm not a bad girl. Don't worry.

1830
01:09:42,904 --> 01:09:44,234
You said you'd be a bad girl today.

1831
01:09:44,234 --> 01:09:45,504
I did,

1832
01:09:45,504 --> 01:09:47,044
- but I'm not. - You're not?

1833
01:09:47,304 --> 01:09:49,544
If I end up with a bad girl, will I be penalized?

1834
01:09:49,614 --> 01:09:50,874
Correct.

1835
01:09:50,914 --> 01:09:52,144
(Glancing)

1836
01:09:53,614 --> 01:09:54,884
(Smiling)

1837
01:09:56,284 --> 01:09:57,484
Am I already partners with a bad girl?

1838
01:09:57,484 --> 01:09:58,824
(Tell me.)

1839
01:09:58,824 --> 01:09:59,824
(Laughing)

1840
01:09:59,824 --> 01:10:00,924
Am I?

1841
01:10:00,984 --> 01:10:03,294
I'm confused.

1842
01:10:03,894 --> 01:10:05,594
(What is this girl?)

1843
01:10:05,594 --> 01:10:07,364
All right.

1844
01:10:07,364 --> 01:10:09,564
Please put on the bracelets.

1845
01:10:09,564 --> 01:10:10,634
Let's go.

1846
01:10:10,634 --> 01:10:11,964
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1847
01:10:11,964 --> 01:10:13,264
Where are we going?

1848
01:10:13,264 --> 01:10:15,434
(Who will end up with the bad girls?)

1849
01:10:15,874 --> 01:10:17,974
It's definitely Tae Yeon, So Min, and Hyo Yeon.

1850
01:10:17,974 --> 01:10:19,174
(Tiffany makes her guesses.)

1851
01:10:19,174 --> 01:10:21,504
You're very good at games.

1852
01:10:21,574 --> 01:10:23,644
- I watch a lot of television. - Really?

1853
01:10:23,644 --> 01:10:25,514
I watch a lot of American dramas.

1854
01:10:25,514 --> 01:10:26,814
How is that related to this?

1855
01:10:26,814 --> 01:10:28,344
- It's... - How is that related to this?

1856
01:10:28,344 --> 01:10:30,484
Today, it's pretty much "Game of Thrones"

1857
01:10:30,484 --> 01:10:32,654
(You just don't know, Se Chan.)

1858
01:10:32,654 --> 01:10:33,984
- "Game of Thrones"? - Yes.

1859
01:10:35,124 --> 01:10:37,054
We move from place to place,

1860
01:10:37,054 --> 01:10:38,994
fight, and suspect each other...

1861
01:10:38,994 --> 01:10:40,394
- It's a big-scale game, right? - Yes.

1862
01:10:41,094 --> 01:10:42,494
I know you're not a bad girl.

1863
01:10:42,764 --> 01:10:44,594
- How did you find out? - I just know.

1864
01:10:45,294 --> 01:10:46,764
- Thank you. - I really know.

1865
01:10:46,864 --> 01:10:48,104
That's why I chose you.

1866
01:10:48,804 --> 01:10:50,404
- I'm so touched. - Really.

1867
01:10:51,204 --> 01:10:54,104
Hyo Yeon. I'm 100 percent sure she is a bad girl.

1868
01:10:55,004 --> 01:10:56,614
(Me?)

1869
01:10:56,614 --> 01:10:59,744
Is there a reason why you sent Yoon A...

1870
01:11:00,414 --> 01:11:01,644
to the other team?

1871
01:11:01,914 --> 01:11:03,014
She looked like a bad girl.

1872
01:11:03,014 --> 01:11:05,184
(She looked like a bad girl.)

1873
01:11:07,124 --> 01:11:09,024
Were there any hints or...

1874
01:11:09,524 --> 01:11:13,094
Either you or Yoon A is a bad girl, right?

1875
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:15,534
Correct.

1876
01:11:16,534 --> 01:11:17,634
Is it you?

1877
01:11:18,964 --> 01:11:20,664
I'm sorry.

1878
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:22,804
If you are a bad girl, why did you choose me?

1879
01:11:22,804 --> 01:11:24,804
I'm definitely not a bad girl.

1880
01:11:24,804 --> 01:11:27,304
You'll see when this is aired.

1881
01:11:27,304 --> 01:11:32,014
The red mat just happened to be in front of me.

1882
01:11:32,484 --> 01:11:35,114
(Confused)

1883
01:11:35,384 --> 01:11:36,784
Who do you think is a bad girl?

1884
01:11:36,914 --> 01:11:39,754
We didn't have lunch together.

1885
01:11:41,684 --> 01:11:44,254
(You)

1886
01:11:44,254 --> 01:11:46,264
Let me explain.

1887
01:11:46,264 --> 01:11:48,194
- What should I do? - Let me explain.

1888
01:11:49,664 --> 01:11:52,404
We'll just have to break up the couples.

1889
01:11:52,464 --> 01:11:54,464
We have to take someone's place.

1890
01:11:54,634 --> 01:11:56,234
- Yes. - We have to do that.

1891
01:11:56,234 --> 01:11:58,374
(Bad girls on Team Singles have to become someone's partner.)

1892
01:11:58,374 --> 01:11:59,744
I'll just chase everyone.

1893
01:12:00,404 --> 01:12:01,974
I'll do my best.

1894
01:12:01,974 --> 01:12:03,444
I haven't had any partners yet.

1895
01:12:03,474 --> 01:12:05,314
(The good girls on Team Singles have to rescue...)

1896
01:12:05,344 --> 01:12:07,214
(the boys from the bad girls.)

1897
01:12:07,214 --> 01:12:10,114
(How will the three play?)

1898
01:12:10,654 --> 01:12:12,584
- The race will start soon. - Let's go.

1899
01:12:12,854 --> 01:12:14,284
- Five, - Let's go.

1900
01:12:14,284 --> 01:12:16,194
four, three...

1901
01:12:16,194 --> 01:12:17,994
- Two, one. - Two, one.

1902
01:12:18,124 --> 01:12:19,764
The race starts now.

1903
01:12:19,964 --> 01:12:21,024
Let's go.

1904
01:12:21,694 --> 01:12:22,834
(They have to find as many hints as possible.)

1905
01:12:22,834 --> 01:12:25,664
- Let's look for evidence. - Let's go.

1906
01:12:25,834 --> 01:12:27,164
We have to find hints.

1907
01:12:27,564 --> 01:12:32,444
(Partners)

1908
01:12:32,604 --> 01:12:34,874
We have to find as many hints as possible.

1909
01:12:34,874 --> 01:12:36,214
(Once a bracelet is cut, partners will be changed.)

1910
01:12:36,214 --> 01:12:39,084
If Team Singles tries to cut our bracelet, remove their name tags.

1911
01:12:39,514 --> 01:12:41,344
- Okay. - They'll stop for a minute.

1912
01:12:43,514 --> 01:12:44,614
Wait.

1913
01:12:45,924 --> 01:12:47,424
This camera...

1914
01:12:47,454 --> 01:12:50,324
- only follows special people. - Why is it here?

1915
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:52,764
(A camera for special people?)

1916
01:12:53,464 --> 01:12:54,794
Why is it here?

1917
01:12:54,794 --> 01:12:57,334
It means either you or I am special.

1918
01:12:57,694 --> 01:12:58,804
(I don't think I'm special.)

1919
01:12:58,804 --> 01:13:00,134
I mean...

1920
01:13:00,134 --> 01:13:02,474
- Why do you suspect me? - I'll stop.

1921
01:13:02,474 --> 01:13:03,634
(Doubtful)

1922
01:13:03,634 --> 01:13:05,674
You're suspecting me.

1923
01:13:05,674 --> 01:13:07,104
- Not here? - It's filming you.

1924
01:13:07,104 --> 01:13:09,674
(It's filming you.)

1925
01:13:09,674 --> 01:13:11,074
I'm not a bad girl.

1926
01:13:13,044 --> 01:13:15,284
(Gosh, you bad girl.)

1927
01:13:15,284 --> 01:13:16,554
(Wink)

1928
01:13:17,384 --> 01:13:19,684
(Team Partners are looking for hints.)

1929
01:13:19,684 --> 01:13:22,054
(Team Singles are waiting.)

1930
01:13:22,054 --> 01:13:24,154
Last time, I was an angel.

1931
01:13:24,594 --> 01:13:25,694
This time...

1932
01:13:27,224 --> 01:13:29,894
Let's do this.

1933
01:13:29,894 --> 01:13:31,264
(Here we go.)

1934
01:13:31,264 --> 01:13:35,534
(Team Singles are on the move.)

1935
01:13:37,934 --> 01:13:39,174
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1936
01:13:40,104 --> 01:13:41,204
Do you want to go first?

1937
01:13:41,204 --> 01:13:42,314
(Looking around)

1938
01:13:45,884 --> 01:13:47,114
(Who is that?)

1939
01:13:49,114 --> 01:13:50,284
It's Tae Yeon.

1940
01:13:50,854 --> 01:13:52,054
Let's run.

1941
01:13:52,054 --> 01:13:54,824
(They instinctively run.)

1942
01:13:56,054 --> 01:13:59,624
(It's a dead end.)

1943
01:14:01,964 --> 01:14:03,834
- We can't go here. - Come.

1944
01:14:04,064 --> 01:14:05,164
Come here.

1945
01:14:05,164 --> 01:14:08,334
(Come here, cameraman.)

1946
01:14:08,934 --> 01:14:11,934
(Is she gone?)

1947
01:14:13,374 --> 01:14:15,174
What are you doing there?

1948
01:14:15,174 --> 01:14:17,474
(Here you are.)

1949
01:14:17,474 --> 01:14:19,584
(Smiling)

1950
01:14:20,314 --> 01:14:21,714
You're not a bad girl, are you?

1951
01:14:22,754 --> 01:14:25,454
You shouldn't ask that so explicitly.

1952
01:14:28,024 --> 01:14:29,494
(Locked)

1953
01:14:30,224 --> 01:14:31,594
What are you doing?

1954
01:14:31,594 --> 01:14:35,634
(They have to eliminate Tae Yeon's name tag.)

1955
01:14:35,634 --> 01:14:38,234
She is a bad girl. I told you.

1956
01:14:38,334 --> 01:14:40,034
- Is the door locked? - I know you.

1957
01:14:40,164 --> 01:14:41,204
Is it locked?

1958
01:14:43,574 --> 01:14:45,234
She is a bad girl.

1959
01:14:45,234 --> 01:14:46,474
Hold on.

1960
01:14:46,474 --> 01:14:48,844
Didn't you see how she came down the stairs?

1961
01:14:49,114 --> 01:14:50,774
If we tear her name tag,

1962
01:14:50,774 --> 01:14:52,984
we can just enjoy her dance.

1963
01:14:54,144 --> 01:14:56,984
(You want to rip my name tag?)

1964
01:14:57,884 --> 01:14:59,254
What?

1965
01:14:59,254 --> 01:15:00,554
Has the situation reversed?

1966
01:15:00,824 --> 01:15:02,224
Come here.

1967
01:15:02,224 --> 01:15:03,694
Come here.

1968
01:15:04,154 --> 01:15:06,894
Let's see her dance.

1969
01:15:07,394 --> 01:15:08,594
- Hurry up. - No.

1970
01:15:08,594 --> 01:15:10,434
No. I'm not a bad girl.

1971
01:15:10,434 --> 01:15:12,634
I'm not, guys.

1972
01:15:12,634 --> 01:15:13,734
Dance now.

1973
01:15:13,734 --> 01:15:15,064
(Name tag eliminated)

1974
01:15:15,904 --> 01:15:16,974
(Tae Yeon is penalized.)

1975
01:15:16,974 --> 01:15:18,574
- Dance for a minute. - Go.

1976
01:15:18,574 --> 01:15:19,804
She looks scary.

1977
01:15:19,804 --> 01:15:21,604
(Dancing)

1978
01:15:22,014 --> 01:15:24,014
- Let's go. - She's scary.

1979
01:15:24,644 --> 01:15:26,944
(She is definitely a bad girl.)

1980
01:15:27,784 --> 01:15:30,684
(A bad girl's groove)

1981
01:15:32,554 --> 01:15:38,824
(Is Tae Yeon really a bad girl?)

1982
01:15:42,034 --> 01:15:45,294
(Dressing room)

1983
01:15:45,294 --> 01:15:48,774
(There may be hints hidden around here.)

1984
01:15:48,774 --> 01:15:50,134
Where?

1985
01:15:51,534 --> 01:15:52,604
(A hint is found.)

1986
01:15:52,604 --> 01:15:54,104
Let's go.

1987
01:15:54,104 --> 01:15:55,374
We have to hide.

1988
01:15:56,774 --> 01:15:59,484
(Bad girls have won a Rookie of the Year award.)

1989
01:15:59,484 --> 01:16:00,944
"Bad girls have won a Rookie of the Year award."

1990
01:16:01,084 --> 01:16:02,454
- Girls' Generation... - You've won it, right?

1991
01:16:02,514 --> 01:16:04,284
- We've won it. - Then everyone has.

1992
01:16:06,484 --> 01:16:07,554
What about So Min?

1993
01:16:08,854 --> 01:16:10,124
We should ask.

1994
01:16:11,124 --> 01:16:17,334
(If So Min has won the award, she is a candidate too.)

1995
01:16:17,334 --> 01:16:18,534
She has.

1996
01:16:18,534 --> 01:16:20,634
(So Min has won a Rookie of the Year award.)

1997
01:16:20,634 --> 01:16:22,634
So Min should be included too then.

1998
01:16:22,934 --> 01:16:24,004
Okay.

1999
01:16:24,404 --> 01:16:26,174
- Okay. - We can't exclude her.

2000
01:16:26,174 --> 01:16:27,604
This is incredible, isn't it?

2001
01:16:28,274 --> 01:16:29,844
So that's how it is.

2002
01:16:31,114 --> 01:16:34,484
(Where is everyone?)

2003
01:16:34,484 --> 01:16:36,554
Over there is...

2004
01:16:36,554 --> 01:16:37,684
a bad girl.

2005
01:16:38,154 --> 01:16:40,124
- She looks like a ghost. - Over there is So Min.

2006
01:16:40,124 --> 01:16:41,184
Let's run.

2007
01:16:41,754 --> 01:16:42,794
This isn't the right way.

2008
01:16:42,924 --> 01:16:43,994
No.

2009
01:16:44,924 --> 01:16:46,864
Run.

2010
01:16:46,864 --> 01:16:48,494
(The partners run away.)

2011
01:16:49,664 --> 01:16:51,634
Stop running.

2012
01:16:51,634 --> 01:16:52,834
No, we need to run.

2013
01:16:53,304 --> 01:16:55,034
- Stop running. - She is coming this way.

2014
01:16:55,234 --> 01:16:56,274
Run.

2015
01:16:56,274 --> 01:16:57,274
(So Min targets the weakest couple.)

2016
01:16:57,534 --> 01:16:59,544
Stop following us.

2017
01:16:59,544 --> 01:17:01,704
- No, Seok Jin. - No.

2018
01:17:01,704 --> 01:17:03,474
No, no, no.

2019
01:17:03,844 --> 01:17:05,314
Let go of me.

2020
01:17:05,314 --> 01:17:06,814
(So Min tries to take Seok Jin while Yu Ri tries to stop her.)

2021
01:17:06,814 --> 01:17:09,114
No, So Min. No, no, no.

2022
01:17:09,114 --> 01:17:11,354
- No. - I cut it.

2023
01:17:11,414 --> 01:17:14,224
- I cut her bracelet. - So Min cut the bracelet.

2024
01:17:14,224 --> 01:17:15,224
(Seok Jin and So Min are the new partners.)

2025
01:17:16,724 --> 01:17:18,964
If Yoon A is a bad girl, I don't have the right to vote.

2026
01:17:20,194 --> 01:17:22,894
You are right.

2027
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:25,234
- "You are right"? - Wait, that's not true.

2028
01:17:25,564 --> 01:17:27,404
- You said, "You are right." - No.

2029
01:17:27,534 --> 01:17:28,564
That's not true.

2030
01:17:28,564 --> 01:17:29,604
(Are you a bad girl too?)

2031
01:17:30,634 --> 01:17:32,144
I don't think it's here.

2032
01:17:32,144 --> 01:17:37,444
(Partnering up with a bad girl twice makes you lose your right to vote.)

2033
01:17:37,644 --> 01:17:38,844
Gosh, look.

2034
01:17:38,844 --> 01:17:40,284
That's incredible.

2035
01:17:40,944 --> 01:17:42,284
(The boss of Team Bad Girls is over 165cm tall.)

2036
01:17:42,284 --> 01:17:43,954
The boss of Team Bad Girls is over 165cm tall.

2037
01:17:44,284 --> 01:17:47,284
Kwang Soo, I am 161.4cm tall.

2038
01:17:48,154 --> 01:17:51,054
Yoon A is 168cm tall and Yu Ri is 167cm tall.

2039
01:17:51,054 --> 01:17:52,564
Soo Young is 170cm tall.

2040
01:17:54,664 --> 01:17:56,834
One of the bad girls is over 165cm tall.

2041
01:17:56,834 --> 01:17:57,894
That's right.

2042
01:17:57,994 --> 01:17:59,734
Other bad girls could be shorter.

2043
01:18:00,434 --> 01:18:02,434
Do you think I am one of them? Wait and see.

2044
01:18:02,434 --> 01:18:04,504
- Let's find one more hint. - You will see that I was right.

2045
01:18:04,504 --> 01:18:05,974
We just need to find one more hint.

2046
01:18:07,174 --> 01:18:10,314
- Who are the candidates? - Yoon A, Yu Ri, and Soo Young.

2047
01:18:11,544 --> 01:18:13,584
- What about So Min? - Right, there is So Min.

2048
01:18:13,984 --> 01:18:15,614
Is she over 165cm tall?

2049
01:18:15,614 --> 01:18:16,784
I am not sure.

2050
01:18:17,214 --> 01:18:18,884
I think she is taller than that.

2051
01:18:20,154 --> 01:18:21,384
Who do you think it is?

2052
01:18:22,194 --> 01:18:24,124
(Staring)

2053
01:18:24,824 --> 01:18:26,764
I am sorry.

2054
01:18:26,764 --> 01:18:28,834
I didn't stare because I thought it's you.

2055
01:18:29,564 --> 01:18:30,594
I was thinking.

2056
01:18:31,394 --> 01:18:33,464
It really isn't me.

2057
01:18:35,574 --> 01:18:37,734
Let's put our hands inside the blood pressure monitor.

2058
01:18:37,734 --> 01:18:39,004
(Jong Kook and Soo Young are looking for hints.)

2059
01:18:39,104 --> 01:18:40,304
(Putting his hand inside)

2060
01:18:41,174 --> 01:18:42,444
This is unbelievable.

2061
01:18:42,444 --> 01:18:43,914
(He finds a hint out of pure luck.)

2062
01:18:43,914 --> 01:18:46,044
This is unbelievable, Soo Young.

2063
01:18:47,144 --> 01:18:48,214
All right.

2064
01:18:48,214 --> 01:18:50,554
The bad girls' blood types are O or AB.

2065
01:18:50,554 --> 01:18:53,324
(The bad girls' blood types are O or AB.)

2066
01:18:53,324 --> 01:18:55,694
You must know their blood types.

2067
01:18:55,694 --> 01:18:57,494
- I am type O. - You are type O.

2068
01:18:58,624 --> 01:19:00,124
- I am type O. - You are type O.

2069
01:19:00,124 --> 01:19:01,764
- Tae Yeon is type O. - Okay.

2070
01:19:02,464 --> 01:19:04,464
Yu Ri is type AB and Hyo Yeon is type AB.

2071
01:19:04,464 --> 01:19:06,834
(Soo Young, Tae Yeon, Yu Ri, and Hyo Yeon)

2072
01:19:06,834 --> 01:19:08,164
Is Yu Ri type AB?

2073
01:19:09,374 --> 01:19:10,704
- Hyo Yeon. - Tiffany is type O.

2074
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:12,444
What? Really?

2075
01:19:13,944 --> 01:19:17,274
(The combined hints reveal the 4 bad girl candidates.)

2076
01:19:17,674 --> 01:19:19,644
Every hint must be like this.

2077
01:19:19,784 --> 01:19:21,914
You are right. It doesn't tell us anything definite.

2078
01:19:21,914 --> 01:19:22,984
Did you say you are type O?

2079
01:19:22,984 --> 01:19:24,414
- A lot of us are. - So...

2080
01:19:24,414 --> 01:19:26,324
Most members are type O or AB.

2081
01:19:26,324 --> 01:19:28,554
- They are types O and AB too. - You are right.

2082
01:19:28,654 --> 01:19:30,924
That's right. They are types O and AB.

2083
01:19:31,054 --> 01:19:33,494
Look at her. She has a strong will.

2084
01:19:33,564 --> 01:19:35,264
Tae Yeon does. Right?

2085
01:19:35,764 --> 01:19:37,364
- Tae Yeon has a strong will. - She looks scary.

2086
01:19:38,094 --> 01:19:40,634
- Look. She has a strong will. - She looks scary.

2087
01:19:41,034 --> 01:19:42,174
Let's go down.

2088
01:19:42,974 --> 01:19:44,534
We need to go. She is suspicious.

2089
01:19:44,534 --> 01:19:46,004
(Not even Jong Kook can fight the bad girl.)

2090
01:19:46,004 --> 01:19:48,504
Don't run. I am not going to run.

2091
01:19:48,974 --> 01:19:50,144
She told us not to run.

2092
01:19:50,144 --> 01:19:52,144
- "Don't run"? - That's scarier.

2093
01:19:53,684 --> 01:19:54,984
For goodness' sake.

2094
01:19:55,684 --> 01:19:56,754
Why are they coming down?

2095
01:19:57,014 --> 01:19:58,454
Do you know So Min's blood type?

2096
01:19:58,554 --> 01:20:00,554
So Min's blood type? It's AB.

2097
01:20:02,094 --> 01:20:03,554
So Min said that her blood type is AB.

2098
01:20:04,554 --> 01:20:06,864
(Does that mean So Min is a bad girl?)

2099
01:20:07,124 --> 01:20:09,434
- You aren't a bad girl, are you? - No, I am not.

2100
01:20:10,594 --> 01:20:11,894
I want to be a bad girl.

2101
01:20:13,804 --> 01:20:16,534
(Both So Min and Yoon A are in Team Partners now.)

2102
01:20:16,534 --> 01:20:17,634
This is crazy.

2103
01:20:17,774 --> 01:20:18,904
I am so scared.

2104
01:20:19,104 --> 01:20:20,844
- Who is next to Kwang Soo? - Yoon A.

2105
01:20:20,844 --> 01:20:23,774
- Yoon A. - Hyo Yeon is gritting her teeth.

2106
01:20:23,774 --> 01:20:26,584
- I heard you gave your arm. - You gave your arm.

2107
01:20:27,884 --> 01:20:29,114
Are you sure you aren't a bad girl?

2108
01:20:29,114 --> 01:20:31,154
- If you aren't a bad girl... - Listen to me.

2109
01:20:31,154 --> 01:20:32,924
- Are you sure that you aren't? - I am not.

2110
01:20:32,924 --> 01:20:34,584
- Wait a minute. - Listen to me.

2111
01:20:34,584 --> 01:20:36,524
- Let go of his arm. - You can decide.

2112
01:20:36,524 --> 01:20:37,754
(You can decide.)

2113
01:20:38,594 --> 01:20:42,764
(What is Kwang Soo's decision?)

2114
01:20:42,764 --> 01:20:44,234
(He exchanges his partner.)

2115
01:20:44,234 --> 01:20:47,304
I knew he wasn't a cool man.

2116
01:20:47,304 --> 01:20:49,404
- What are you talking about? - Hyo Yeon.

2117
01:20:49,404 --> 01:20:51,534
Having Terius' hairstyle doesn't make him cool.

2118
01:20:51,534 --> 01:20:53,174
I need to look for hints.

2119
01:20:53,174 --> 01:20:55,174
People all think you are a bad girl.

2120
01:20:55,304 --> 01:20:56,374
Forget it.

2121
01:20:58,684 --> 01:21:00,714
I didn't give my arm.

2122
01:21:01,814 --> 01:21:03,414
Let's get some air on our palms.

2123
01:21:04,914 --> 01:21:06,784
(Let's see.)

2124
01:21:06,784 --> 01:21:08,154
I think she is...

2125
01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:10,254
My goodness.

2126
01:21:13,694 --> 01:21:14,794
What was that?

2127
01:21:14,794 --> 01:21:15,994
(Laughing)

2128
01:21:17,064 --> 01:21:18,294
Are you a bad girl?

2129
01:21:18,294 --> 01:21:19,904
- You lost your voting right. - Why?

2130
01:21:19,904 --> 01:21:21,234
- Why? - You changed partners twice.

2131
01:21:21,804 --> 01:21:27,004
(What is So Min's identity?)

2132
01:21:27,974 --> 01:21:31,444
(The preliminary shoot before the opening)

2133
01:21:31,444 --> 01:21:33,084
- Hello. - Hello.

2134
01:21:33,944 --> 01:21:36,484
(So Min is a bad girl.)

2135
01:21:36,484 --> 01:21:39,954
Today, it'll be Partner Race with Girls' Generation.

2136
01:21:39,954 --> 01:21:42,254
The mission is called My Girls' Generation,

2137
01:21:42,254 --> 01:21:44,054
My Bad Girls' Generation.

2138
01:21:44,054 --> 01:21:45,124
(The bad girls are So Min and 2 members of Girls' Generation.)

2139
01:21:45,124 --> 01:21:48,524
The three of you are the bad girls...

2140
01:21:48,524 --> 01:21:50,194
- who break apart the partners. - We are the bad girls.

2141
01:21:51,134 --> 01:21:54,234
So Min is the boss of Team Bad Girls.

2142
01:21:54,504 --> 01:21:57,804
(Am I the boss of Team Bad Girls?)

2143
01:21:57,904 --> 01:21:59,474
(So Min is the boss of Team Bad Girls.)

2144
01:21:59,474 --> 01:22:00,674
- Look at his face. - Kwang Soo,

2145
01:22:00,674 --> 01:22:03,444
- Jong Kook said she is a bad girl. - I am not a bad girl.

2146
01:22:03,444 --> 01:22:04,774
- I am not. - Jae Seok said the same thing.

2147
01:22:04,774 --> 01:22:07,044
- I am not a bad girl. - Get a new partner quickly.

2148
01:22:07,044 --> 01:22:09,884
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo don't have voting rights.)

2149
01:22:10,984 --> 01:22:11,984
Who is that?

2150
01:22:12,054 --> 01:22:13,184
Yu Ri is okay.

2151
01:22:13,854 --> 01:22:15,494
- Who is that? - Who is that?

2152
01:22:15,494 --> 01:22:16,724
(Tae Yeon is behind Yu Ri.)

2153
01:22:16,724 --> 01:22:18,254
Who are the bad girls?

2154
01:22:19,524 --> 01:22:21,024
What is it? Are you a bad girl?

2155
01:22:21,124 --> 01:22:22,164
Are you a bad girl?

2156
01:22:22,164 --> 01:22:25,264
- Stick to the wall. - Tae Yeon is just standing there.

2157
01:22:25,264 --> 01:22:26,264
(Cutting)

2158
01:22:27,904 --> 01:22:29,274
- My goodness. - You have a new partner.

2159
01:22:29,274 --> 01:22:31,534
It's an exchange.

2160
01:22:31,534 --> 01:22:33,344
(Who is Yu Ri?)

2161
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:34,344
- It's an exchange. - Are you a bad girl?

2162
01:22:34,344 --> 01:22:35,974
I am not a bad girl.

2163
01:22:35,974 --> 01:22:37,774
It's just that I don't have a partner.

2164
01:22:37,774 --> 01:22:41,184
(Team Singles continues to thrive.)

2165
01:22:41,184 --> 01:22:42,984
You cut the couple bracelet to make me lose my voting right.

2166
01:22:42,984 --> 01:22:45,684
- That's not true. - She must be a bad girl.

2167
01:22:46,054 --> 01:22:47,724
(Peeking)

2168
01:22:49,194 --> 01:22:50,654
(This is the moment.)

2169
01:22:50,654 --> 01:22:52,164
Seok Jin.

2170
01:22:52,164 --> 01:22:53,194
(Tae Yeon attacks.)

2171
01:22:53,194 --> 01:22:57,334
(Tae Yeon Alert is issued.)

2172
01:22:58,864 --> 01:23:01,034
My goodness. What are you doing?

2173
01:23:02,374 --> 01:23:04,074
The couple bracelet got ripped.

2174
01:23:05,504 --> 01:23:07,474
It got ripped when you fell down.

2175
01:23:08,044 --> 01:23:09,074
Are you okay?

2176
01:23:10,574 --> 01:23:12,644
For goodness' sake.

2177
01:23:12,714 --> 01:23:14,014
Did you cut it?

2178
01:23:14,014 --> 01:23:16,284
(She loses her position as Seok Jin's partner.)

2179
01:23:16,354 --> 01:23:19,124
With so many partners, I must have lost my voting right.

2180
01:23:19,754 --> 01:23:21,254
- Seriously. - This is hilarious.

2181
01:23:21,254 --> 01:23:22,754
My partner got switched so often.

2182
01:23:23,894 --> 01:23:25,994
(The current couples)

2183
01:23:25,994 --> 01:23:28,524
(Yoon A, Hyo Yeon, and Tiffany are the singles.)

2184
01:23:29,494 --> 01:23:30,764
(Meanwhile)

2185
01:23:30,764 --> 01:23:34,834
Why are we running? Do we need to run away?

2186
01:23:35,164 --> 01:23:38,174
- It's not like that. - Let's go.

2187
01:23:38,774 --> 01:23:40,674
(Let's take away his voting right.)

2188
01:23:40,674 --> 01:23:41,974
You have a partner.

2189
01:23:41,974 --> 01:23:43,444
- What is going on? - She has to be a bad girl.

2190
01:23:43,444 --> 01:23:45,014
- That's not true. - She has to be a bad girl.

2191
01:23:45,044 --> 01:23:46,184
What is wrong with you?

2192
01:23:46,714 --> 01:23:48,884
It hasn't been 30 seconds since we became a couple.

2193
01:23:49,254 --> 01:23:51,714
She rips every couple bracelet in sight.

2194
01:23:51,714 --> 01:23:52,984
It's So Min.

2195
01:23:53,754 --> 01:23:54,924
What was that?

2196
01:23:55,284 --> 01:23:57,454
Don't you want to be my partner? What is wrong with you?

2197
01:23:58,054 --> 01:23:59,194
What is wrong with you?

2198
01:23:59,364 --> 01:24:00,964
Are you a crazy girl or a bad girl?

2199
01:24:01,694 --> 01:24:03,194
Do you have something against couple bracelets?

2200
01:24:04,134 --> 01:24:05,134
Wait a minute.

2201
01:24:05,364 --> 01:24:06,534
You are a bad girl, right?

2202
01:24:06,664 --> 01:24:08,134
I am not.

2203
01:24:08,304 --> 01:24:09,674
- I am not. - Come here.

2204
01:24:10,474 --> 01:24:12,274
- Come here. - It's not like that.

2205
01:24:12,274 --> 01:24:13,674
- You have to be a bad girl. - I am not a bad girl.

2206
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:14,944
Save me.

2207
01:24:15,674 --> 01:24:18,114
Here is a bad girl. Here is a bad girl.

2208
01:24:18,244 --> 01:24:19,284
I will help him.

2209
01:24:19,284 --> 01:24:20,444
I am not a bad girl.

2210
01:24:20,944 --> 01:24:23,084
(Thanks to So Min, Kwang Soo doesn't have the voting right.)

2211
01:24:24,284 --> 01:24:26,484
You have one minute before the end of the race.

2212
01:24:26,854 --> 01:24:30,454
Currently, Seok Jin doesn't have the voting right.

2213
01:24:30,454 --> 01:24:31,494
What?

2214
01:24:31,494 --> 01:24:32,524
(Seok Jin doesn't have the voting right.)

2215
01:24:32,994 --> 01:24:37,264
Currently, Kwang Soo doesn't have the voting right.

2216
01:24:37,994 --> 01:24:39,964
(Kwang Soo doesn't have the voting right.)

2217
01:24:40,564 --> 01:24:42,874
Seok Jin, you don't have the voting right.

2218
01:24:43,134 --> 01:24:44,204
Why?

2219
01:24:44,704 --> 01:24:47,204
He partnered up with a bad girl more than twice.

2220
01:24:47,204 --> 01:24:49,574
- Are you a bad girl? - No, I am not.

2221
01:24:49,574 --> 01:24:51,214
I told you before.

2222
01:24:51,214 --> 01:24:55,044
You may not talk about bad girls and partners.

2223
01:24:55,714 --> 01:24:56,854
Who are the bad girls?

2224
01:24:57,054 --> 01:24:58,924
- This is incredible. - It's not Hyo Yeon, is it?

2225
01:24:58,984 --> 01:25:01,184
- I am not a bad girl. - It's you, right?

2226
01:25:01,184 --> 01:25:02,494
It's not me.

2227
01:25:03,924 --> 01:25:05,864
- So Min was Kwang Soo's partner. - Hyo Yeon.

2228
01:25:05,864 --> 01:25:07,064
So was Hyo Yeon. He had a lot partners.

2229
01:25:07,064 --> 01:25:09,164
- Yoon A. - So Min is a bad girl.

2230
01:25:10,094 --> 01:25:11,794
- Hyo Yeon has a brother too. - I think Tae Yeon is too.

2231
01:25:11,794 --> 01:25:13,064
I think Hyo Yeon is a bad girl too.

2232
01:25:13,334 --> 01:25:15,634
- Hyo Yeon has a brother. - She does, right?

2233
01:25:17,234 --> 01:25:18,404
Everyone,

2234
01:25:18,634 --> 01:25:20,004
the race is over.

2235
01:25:20,274 --> 01:25:24,944
Each person can vote for two bad girls.

2236
01:25:25,144 --> 01:25:29,384
The three girls with the most number of votes will be judged.

2237
01:25:29,384 --> 01:25:30,754
(The 3 girls with the most number of votes are the final candidates.)

2238
01:25:30,754 --> 01:25:32,824
Soo Young's couple bracelet hasn't been cut once.

2239
01:25:32,824 --> 01:25:34,354
She could be a bad girl.

2240
01:25:34,754 --> 01:25:37,054
I... Sure, I am a bad girl.

2241
01:25:38,894 --> 01:25:41,364
So Min had different partners.

2242
01:25:41,364 --> 01:25:42,594
So Min is a bad girl.

2243
01:25:42,664 --> 01:25:45,564
- So Min is a bad girl. - So Min.

2244
01:25:45,664 --> 01:25:46,934
The other two bad girls are...

2245
01:25:47,704 --> 01:25:49,434
The ones without voting rights are...

2246
01:25:49,574 --> 01:25:53,144
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo don't have voting rights.)

2247
01:25:53,144 --> 01:25:55,474
Yoon A, Tae Yeon, and So Min.

2248
01:25:55,574 --> 01:25:58,174
Now, Jong Kook will vote first.

2249
01:25:58,514 --> 01:26:00,744
We need to catch two bad girls. I am going in.

2250
01:26:02,884 --> 01:26:04,954
(The 3 girls with the most number of votes are the final candidates.)

2251
01:26:04,954 --> 01:26:06,684
My goodness.

2252
01:26:07,784 --> 01:26:09,424
I have no idea.

2253
01:26:10,794 --> 01:26:13,564
(The vote of fate begins.)

2254
01:26:17,934 --> 01:26:19,364
I am not sure about the last one.

2255
01:26:19,364 --> 01:26:20,534
(The suspicious ones,)

2256
01:26:20,534 --> 01:26:22,434
(Tae Yeon)

2257
01:26:22,434 --> 01:26:23,474
Tae Yeon.

2258
01:26:23,474 --> 01:26:25,774
(Tae Yeon and So Min are picked the most.)

2259
01:26:25,774 --> 01:26:26,774
I'm certain.

2260
01:26:26,804 --> 01:26:28,504
(Tae Yeon and So Min are picked the most.)

2261
01:26:28,504 --> 01:26:29,544
Here you go.

2262
01:26:29,944 --> 01:26:31,044
(So Min)

2263
01:26:31,674 --> 01:26:32,684
(Tae Yeon)

2264
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:36,784
(The polls close.)

2265
01:26:37,814 --> 01:26:40,454
(If 2 out of 3 chosen ones are bad girls, Team Partners wins.)

2266
01:26:40,454 --> 01:26:41,984
- We have the result. - Okay.

2267
01:26:41,984 --> 01:26:44,054
(The result is revealed.)

2268
01:26:45,624 --> 01:26:47,624
The one with the most votes...

2269
01:26:47,624 --> 01:26:50,934
(The one with the most votes...)

2270
01:26:50,934 --> 01:26:52,134
received nine votes.

2271
01:26:52,604 --> 01:26:53,764
Everyone voted for her.

2272
01:26:54,334 --> 01:26:56,234
- It's So Min. - Why am I always suspected?

2273
01:26:56,234 --> 01:26:58,134
- Really? - Haha,

2274
01:26:58,134 --> 01:27:00,244
- why do you always suspect me? - No, I didn't.

2275
01:27:00,244 --> 01:27:02,174
We have apprehended a bad girl.

2276
01:27:02,544 --> 01:27:04,344
- We have caught a bad girl. - Right.

2277
01:27:06,284 --> 01:27:07,444
And the second-most voted one...

2278
01:27:07,444 --> 01:27:10,484
(The 2nd-most voted one...)

2279
01:27:10,484 --> 01:27:12,184
- received six votes. - Is it Tae Yeon?

2280
01:27:12,954 --> 01:27:13,984
It's Tae Yeon.

2281
01:27:14,784 --> 01:27:16,424
- Were you confused? - Goodness.

2282
01:27:16,424 --> 01:27:17,694
- You're not a bad girl. - She is...

2283
01:27:17,694 --> 01:27:19,724
It'd be crazy if she turns out innocent.

2284
01:27:19,724 --> 01:27:21,464
If she weren't, why did she play like that?

2285
01:27:21,464 --> 01:27:23,364
Exactly.

2286
01:27:23,764 --> 01:27:27,864
(What is the identity of Tae Yeon?)

2287
01:27:29,604 --> 01:27:31,034
Let's look for hints.

2288
01:27:31,574 --> 01:27:33,244
(Actually, she was...)

2289
01:27:33,244 --> 01:27:35,244
Please give me a hint.

2290
01:27:35,244 --> 01:27:38,074
(Actually, she was an innocent girl, desperate for a hint.)

2291
01:27:40,514 --> 01:27:42,654
(She just looked for hints the best she could.)

2292
01:27:42,654 --> 01:27:44,614
Can you give me a hint?

2293
01:27:44,614 --> 01:27:46,824
(She just wanted to become a couple.)

2294
01:27:46,824 --> 01:27:50,054
(Unfortunately, she took the 2nd place in the voting of bad girls.)

2295
01:27:51,654 --> 01:27:55,164
(So Min, the 1st place, is a bad girl while Tae Yeon isn't.)

2296
01:27:55,764 --> 01:27:56,934
Who took the third place?

2297
01:27:56,934 --> 01:28:01,004
I will announce the one with the third-most votes.

2298
01:28:01,464 --> 01:28:04,774
The final result will be revealed at the set...

2299
01:28:04,904 --> 01:28:06,774
for the ice shower.

2300
01:28:07,874 --> 01:28:09,674
The one with the third-most votes...

2301
01:28:10,374 --> 01:28:11,374
received three votes.

2302
01:28:12,084 --> 01:28:13,084
It's Yu Ri.

2303
01:28:13,084 --> 01:28:15,884
(Yu Ri received 3 votes.)

2304
01:28:17,484 --> 01:28:20,254
(It's Yu Ri? What a twist.)

2305
01:28:21,654 --> 01:28:25,024
Hyo Yeon took the 4th place by 1 vote.

2306
01:28:26,294 --> 01:28:29,264
(So Min is a bad girl, and Tae Yeon is innocent. What about Yu Ri?)

2307
01:28:30,094 --> 01:28:31,094
(The final judgment)

2308
01:28:31,094 --> 01:28:32,264
This is the final judgment.

2309
01:28:32,904 --> 01:28:36,674
On the count of three, if you are not a bad girl,

2310
01:28:36,674 --> 01:28:39,074
you can take a step back. We'll start.

2311
01:28:39,274 --> 01:28:41,674
Were you able to apprehend...

2312
01:28:42,614 --> 01:28:43,644
the bad girls?

2313
01:28:45,174 --> 01:28:48,244
(So far, there is 1 bad girl and 1 innocent girl.)

2314
01:28:48,444 --> 01:28:52,524
(What is the identity of the third nominee, Yu Ri?)

2315
01:28:52,884 --> 01:28:54,824
- Someone who can lie well. - Someone brazen.

2316
01:28:54,924 --> 01:28:59,064
(Yu Ri has been constantly suspected as a bad girl.)

2317
01:28:59,424 --> 01:29:00,694
I think Yu Ri is a bad girl.

2318
01:29:00,694 --> 01:29:04,394
(Their suspicion continued until the final race.)

2319
01:29:04,394 --> 01:29:08,034
(As she daringly attacked others,)

2320
01:29:08,034 --> 01:29:12,644
(she managed to stay as a couple until the end.)

2321
01:29:12,804 --> 01:29:16,874
(Is Yu Ri a bad girl or just an innocent girl?)

2322
01:29:18,444 --> 01:29:22,514
(Or is Hyo Yeon a bad girl who had the 4th most votes by 1 vote?)

2323
01:29:23,084 --> 01:29:25,454
- That's right. - The reason why you chose Yoon A...

2324
01:29:25,454 --> 01:29:28,894
(She seemed suspicious during every game.)

2325
01:29:30,324 --> 01:29:33,994
(She, who's known to be strong, lost an arm wrestling match to Tae Yeon.)

2326
01:29:35,364 --> 01:29:36,834
(All day long, Hyo Yeon has been enjoying the twists.)

2327
01:29:36,834 --> 01:29:39,104
(Is Hyo Yeon a bad girl?)

2328
01:29:40,164 --> 01:29:42,034
(The final judgment)

2329
01:29:42,034 --> 01:29:43,204
Were you able to...

2330
01:29:43,604 --> 01:29:46,244
(If they are not bad girls, they will retreat on the count of three.)

2331
01:29:46,344 --> 01:29:47,344
One.

2332
01:29:47,774 --> 01:29:48,774
(If Hyo Yeon is a bad girl, Team Bad Girls wins.)

2333
01:29:48,774 --> 01:29:49,774
Two.

2334
01:29:50,974 --> 01:29:51,974
Three.

2335
01:29:51,974 --> 01:29:52,984
(If Yu Ri is a bad girl, Team Partners wins.)

2336
01:29:52,984 --> 01:29:55,354
(What is the result?)

2337
01:29:59,584 --> 01:30:02,424
(Yu Ri and So Min are the bad girls.)

2338
01:30:02,424 --> 01:30:05,464
(These two bad girls get the ice shower.)

2339
01:30:08,524 --> 01:30:09,934
- Tae Yeon wasn't a bad girl? - What?

2340
01:30:12,604 --> 01:30:13,764
Hey, Yu Ri!

2341
01:30:14,064 --> 01:30:15,874
I didn't know she was one.

2342
01:30:15,874 --> 01:30:17,274
Tae Yeon wasn't a bad girl?

2343
01:30:17,404 --> 01:30:19,704
- Jong Kook, I'm really sorry. - What?

2344
01:30:19,704 --> 01:30:21,274
(Jong Kook, I'm really sorry.)

2345
01:30:21,274 --> 01:30:23,014
(I'm a bad girl.)

2346
01:30:23,014 --> 01:30:24,644
She said she's sorry. She apologized to me.

2347
01:30:25,274 --> 01:30:27,684
(Soo Young and Jong Kook get the ice shower as well.)

2348
01:30:28,344 --> 01:30:29,354
She was a bad girl?

2349
01:30:29,354 --> 01:30:31,484
(What a shocking twist!)

2350
01:30:31,484 --> 01:30:33,784
- This is unbelievable. - You were a bad girl?

2351
01:30:33,784 --> 01:30:36,194
- I told you it was Soo Young! - It was Soo Young?

2352
01:30:36,194 --> 01:30:38,354
- She was the last bad girl? - Goodness.

2353
01:30:38,354 --> 01:30:39,764
- Tae Yeon wasn't the bad girl? - Unbelievable.

2354
01:30:39,794 --> 01:30:42,234
I told you that I wasn't the bad girl!

2355
01:30:42,634 --> 01:30:44,194
Gosh, I didn't see that coming.

2356
01:30:44,194 --> 01:30:46,504
- Goodness, Soo Young. - Gosh.

2357
01:30:46,504 --> 01:30:48,634
- I was so surprised. - I got goose bumps.

2358
01:30:48,634 --> 01:30:52,144
(Today's bad girls were Soo Young, Yu Ri, and So Min.)

2359
01:30:52,774 --> 01:30:54,074
(Running High School)

2360
01:30:54,144 --> 01:30:55,374
Hello.

2361
01:30:55,374 --> 01:30:56,674
(This morning, 30 minutes before the shoot)

2362
01:30:58,074 --> 01:30:59,414
Hello.

2363
01:30:59,414 --> 01:31:00,514
(The bad girls' preliminary meeting)

2364
01:31:00,514 --> 01:31:02,054
- Hello. - Hi.

2365
01:31:02,054 --> 01:31:03,454
(The bad girls' preliminary meeting)

2366
01:31:03,684 --> 01:31:10,424
You are bad girls who will interfere with other partners.

2367
01:31:10,424 --> 01:31:14,564
(The birth of bad girls)

2368
01:31:14,564 --> 01:31:16,094
You know us well.

2369
01:31:17,794 --> 01:31:19,204
I'm at a disadvantage.

2370
01:31:19,334 --> 01:31:21,064
No one will try to be my partner.

2371
01:31:21,064 --> 01:31:22,874
Girls' Generation is joining us today.

2372
01:31:23,074 --> 01:31:25,504
Should I rip my uniform, so I can seduce them?

2373
01:31:26,244 --> 01:31:27,674
What should I do?

2374
01:31:27,674 --> 01:31:30,544
(So Min, no. That's what a crazy girl does.)

2375
01:31:32,684 --> 01:31:34,584
- It's Bad Girls' Generation now. - It's Bad Girls' Generation now.

2376
01:31:34,584 --> 01:31:36,284
- It will be Bad Girls' Generation. - It will be Bad Girls' Generation.

2377
01:31:36,284 --> 01:31:38,354
- Bad Girls' Generation forever. - Bad Girls' Generation forever.

2378
01:31:41,224 --> 01:31:43,494
(Thus began the highlights of the bad girls.)

2379
01:31:43,494 --> 01:31:44,794
We have to separate the bad girls.

2380
01:31:44,794 --> 01:31:47,524
(During the race, they deceived everyone...)

2381
01:31:47,524 --> 01:31:49,664
(and did their celebratory gestures alone.)

2382
01:31:50,834 --> 01:31:52,834
(The bad girl of this area...)

2383
01:31:52,834 --> 01:31:55,474
(is me!)

2384
01:31:57,174 --> 01:31:59,874
(Before she got caught, she put on a serious look.)

2385
01:32:01,104 --> 01:32:03,574
(The best bad girl has to be Soo Young, hands down.)

2386
01:32:04,174 --> 01:32:05,174
Hey, bad girls.

2387
01:32:05,174 --> 01:32:08,444
(Sometimes, she acted tough.)

2388
01:32:08,444 --> 01:32:12,254
(Sometimes, she was gentle.)

2389
01:32:12,254 --> 01:32:14,624
(She was even able to make Jong Kook let his guard down.)

2390
01:32:14,624 --> 01:32:16,694
(She's the ultimate femme fatale.)

2391
01:32:18,994 --> 01:32:21,164
All right. So today's bad girls were...

2392
01:32:21,264 --> 01:32:24,134
Soo Young, Yu Ri, and So Min.

2393
01:32:24,964 --> 01:32:26,664
This is a twist after a twist.

2394
01:32:26,864 --> 01:32:29,334
- I didn't know Yu Ri was one. - I didn't know Soo Young was.

2395
01:32:29,334 --> 01:32:31,334
- I didn't even suspect her. - Soo Young.

2396
01:32:31,334 --> 01:32:34,674
It's their 10-year anniversary. They joined us after 2 years.

2397
01:32:34,704 --> 01:32:36,644
Thank you for joining us on a hot day like today.

2398
01:32:36,644 --> 01:32:39,084
It was fun, and we enjoyed it very much.

2399
01:32:39,084 --> 01:32:40,884
Thanks to you, we were so happy.

2400
01:32:40,884 --> 01:32:42,384
Let's give it up for Girls' Generation.

2401
01:32:42,384 --> 01:32:43,384
Great work!

2402
01:32:43,384 --> 01:32:45,484
(Their lovely day with the girls has gone by.)

2403
01:32:46,484 --> 01:32:50,754
(All of a sudden, someone has paid them a visit.)

2404
01:32:51,094 --> 01:32:52,194
This is giving me the chills.

2405
01:32:52,724 --> 01:32:55,194
(It's a series of mysterious events...)

2406
01:32:55,194 --> 01:32:58,464
(that can't be identified.)

2407
01:32:58,464 --> 01:33:01,034
(There's more than meets the eye.)

2408
01:33:01,404 --> 01:33:05,134
(This is 2017 Running Man's Horror Special.)

2409
01:33:05,134 --> 01:33:06,604
(Find the Ghost)
