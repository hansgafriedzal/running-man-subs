1
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:08,080
(Do you remember I-Go Project?)

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,080
(Those with 3 I Go Stickers must go on a penalty trip with a member.)

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,289
(So Min's destination is Indonesia's Manual Wooden Cable Car.)

4
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:17,960
(So Min's partner for the penalty is Kwang Soo.)

5
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:20,089
(Jakarta)

6
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:25,660
(Kwang Soo and So Min left for Indonesia.)

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,469
(Indonesia Tiger Moth Tour started.)

8
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:34,310
(The door to the underworld of missions opened.)

9
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:40,079
(The tiger moth siblings' fierce survival in Indonesia)

10
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,719
(Who will earn more mission money and become the winner?)

11
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,060
(Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game)

12
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,789
(Find the one who is speaking the truth.)

13
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:59,259
(The professional liars searched for the truth.)

14
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:03,270
(The unchosen one and the fooled members received penalty badges.)

15
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,870
(The toll of penalty badges)

16
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,709
(They accumulated penalty badges through Round 1 and 2.)

17
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:15,209
(Jae Seok and Se Chan had to go on a slingshot ride.)

18
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,349
(They were forced to enjoy the sky from a height.)

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,849
(The toll of penalty badges)

20
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,489
(Finally,)

21
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:25,890
(the tiger moth siblings arrive at their destination.)

22
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,900
(They must ride a wooden cable car and fight against the waves.)

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,099
(Did they safely carry out the penalty?)

24
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:37,569
(Today comes a legendary penalty that is even scarier.)

25
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,870
(The 2 members with the most number of penalty badges...)

26
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,310
(will receive a live penalty for Chuseok.)

27
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,379
(Who will be the 2 members?)

28
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:49,750
Everyone, Round Two is over.

29
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,120
Let's move to the next location for Round 3 and 4 of Truth Game.

30
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,120
Okay.

31
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,719
Let's go.

32
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,620
- For goodness' sake. - This ride has cameras.

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,819
What is this?

34
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,900
(A ride blocks them on their way to Round 3.)

35
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,530
What is this?

36
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,170
Will we get dropped from a height again?

37
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,930
From where will we drop?

38
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,539
It looks like we will get dropped from a height again.

39
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,139
It's called Big Swing.

40
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,740
(At the height of 40m,)

41
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,379
(the riders charge forward as they make a semicircle.)

42
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,379
(It's a VIP ride that lets you feel the nature with your entire body.)

43
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,590
- My goodness. - I can't go on it.

44
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,419
- I am getting motion sickness. - Nevis Swing.

45
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:31,560
Nevis Swing.

46
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,919
(The others worry about Big Swing, but he goes on about Nevis Swing.)

47
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:38,430
(Haha and Se Chan must go to Nevis Swing due to visa issues.)

48
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,530
(Nevis Swing in New Zealand is the scariest swing in the world.)

49
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,900
(Why do we need to go?)

50
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,840
(Am I going on...)

51
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,009
(Nevis Swing?)

52
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,810
(Nevis Swing occupied Haha's mind throughout the shoot.)

53
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:56,009
Please help me.

54
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,479
I really don't think I can do it.

55
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:01,319
Please give me another way.

56
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:03,389
I can go on anything but that.

57
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:05,490
Don't do that to the scriptwriter.

58
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,490
It's you, right? You are the one who is riding Nevis Swing with me.

59
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,259
It's you, right?

60
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,659
What are you doing here?

61
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,400
Hurry up, and return to your position.

62
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:16,129
My goodness.

63
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:18,099
We are ruined.

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,340
We will reveal the penalty of Round Three first.

65
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:24,879
- The penalty of Round Three is... - There is a penalty.

66
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:29,449
an extreme ride that lets you fly like a moth from the height of 36m.

67
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,219
It's really scary.

68
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:33,389
It's really scary.

69
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:34,750
Please focus.

70
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,620
I'll be really focused.

71
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,759
Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game Round 3.

72
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,789
- Play video. - I can't do it.

73
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:42,129
(Will they win or be penalized?)

74
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:45,500
(Tiger Moth Tour Question 3)

75
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,969
(Kwang Soo and So Min head to Pantai Timang.)

76
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:48,400
I still can't believe it.

77
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,240
- That we're in Indonesia? - Yes.

78
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,740
(Depressed)

79
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,810
Let's stay in a good mood by laughing.

80
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,379
We can laugh like this.

81
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,379
(Let's enjoy it.)

82
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:00,650
I'll try to enjoy it.

83
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,310
- How... - It was really pretty.

84
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,050
The color of the sea was beautiful when I saw it yesterday.

85
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,150
(The cable car that So Min saw on video)

86
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,090
(It's a bright emerald color.)

87
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,629
(In the middle of the vast sea...)

88
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,430
(is a relaxing ride.)

89
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,899
(Cable car at Pantai Timang where you can relax and enjoy)

90
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
It'll be beautiful.

91
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,870
(It may turn out better than expected.)

92
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,240
(With hopes in their hearts, they travel for 3.5 hours.)

93
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,279
It's cloudy.

94
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:33,750
It might rain.

95
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,779
- I think... - Are we here?

96
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:41,089
We have to take a four-wheel jeep from here.

97
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:42,350
- Do we have to travel more? - Do we transfer?

98
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:44,519
- Yes. - We aren't here yet?

99
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,430
The road is too dangerous to travel in this car.

100
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,160
Where are we going?

101
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,399
Is this "The Law of Jungle"?

102
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:54,470
How far are we going?

103
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,139
I thought we arrived.

104
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,670
Please transfer to the jeep.

105
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,670
(It's another penalty.)

106
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,180
(You're watching Tiger Moth Penalty Tour.)

107
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,480
They continue traveling.

108
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:07,050
We went farther.

109
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,079
Much farther.

110
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,879
(One hour left until the cable car)

111
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,490
(What's going on?)

112
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:15,050
- It's endless. - On the way...

113
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,959
to be penalized isn't easy.

114
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,220
The trip itself is a penalty.

115
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,129
- It's so cute. - Which do we ride?

116
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:22,759
It's this one.

117
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,329
- It's really cute. - Are we supposed to take a jeep?

118
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,000
Does it wobble a lot?

119
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:29,000
It seems like a honeymoon.

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,399
They're wearing matching outfits.

121
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:32,899
- It was by accident. - It was.

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,170
They look good together.

123
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,980
You're too tall to fit.

124
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,449
It's cool.

125
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:42,779
The jeep is so small.

126
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:44,579
(They'll arrive at the destination soon.)

127
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,050
(He doesn't forget to wave to his fans.)

128
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,689
(It's exciting to ride the jeep.)

129
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,589
It feels like we're traveling.

130
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,569
It doesn't wobble as much as I expected.

131
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,600
(After traveling for 5 minutes,)

132
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,269
(they enter an unpaved road.)

133
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:10,439
- Goodness. - I feel nauseous.

134
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,750
(Shaking)

135
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,379
All my insides are shaking.

136
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,680
This is only the start.

137
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,290
I was excited for nothing.

138
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,220
(It's definitely not a pleasant trip.)

139
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,259
Is this necessary?

140
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,990
That must be nauseating.

141
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,759
It was terrible.

142
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,000
We came in farther.

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,230
It's a long trip.

144
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,100
I keep thinking whether I did something terribly wrong...

145
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,240
since yesterday.

146
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,870
(He blames Unlucky Ones' Race.)

147
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,709
I hope this suffering will end.

148
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:46,339
- I know. - It's painful.

149
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:49,050
It feels like overdue homework. Let's finish it.

150
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,519
We travel much farther.

151
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,649
Much farther.

152
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,519
It's a rough trip.

153
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,519
(How far must they go?)

154
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,589
(The trip is endless and rough.)

155
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:01,089
(They're on their way to finish their overdue homework.)

156
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,000
Let's pretend to look happy from the back.

157
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,069
They're filming us behind.

158
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,399
(It's a wonderful trip.)

159
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:15,610
(She's with the Prince of Asia.)

160
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,379
Are you pretending to be excited?

161
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:18,579
(The smell of wood from the cable car)

162
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:23,350
(Cable car and Pantai Timang, here we come.)

163
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:25,779
(They look happy from the back.)

164
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,350
Doesn't it smell like the sea?

165
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,720
- I start to smell it. - It smells like the sea.

166
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,459
- This is great. - I smell the sea.

167
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:33,490
What's this?

168
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,329
(What do they see?)

169
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:38,860
- We're here for a penalty. - I know.

170
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,699
- What's going on? - It was crowded with his fans.

171
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Really?

172
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Were your fans there?

173
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,110
They came all the way here.

174
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,170
(You're awesome, Kwang Soo.)

175
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:54,579
(Prince of Asia appears.)

176
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,579
(Not only do the fans welcome Kwang Soo,)

177
00:07:57,579 --> 00:08:01,290
(but they also welcome the other Running Man members.)

178
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,860
I knew it, Kwang Soo.

179
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Will Kwang Soo make another disgusting face?

180
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,529
(No way,)

181
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,529
What did you say?

182
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,230
- I don't want to see it. - What?

183
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,430
There it is.

184
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,769
- He starts again. - There's the look.

185
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,870
(He shows his charming smile.)

186
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,939
(Hello, I'm Lee Kwang Soo.)

187
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:24,939
They even liked his hairstyle.

188
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,779
I don't understand why.

189
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:28,379
He seems so happy.

190
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,180
He can't stop smiling.

191
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,350
He doesn't stop waving his hand.

192
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,620
Let me see.

193
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,519
You don't forget to wave your hand.

194
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,490
You keep waving.

195
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,129
(They arrive at the final destination.)

196
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,200
I'm exhausted.

197
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,799
Welcome to Pantai Timang.

198
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,799
(The cable car is right in the front.)

199
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,100
Look at that.

200
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,710
- It looks unreal. - We might break a camera.

201
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,080
(It's a steep cliff.)

202
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,480
Is that it?

203
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,409
It looks amazing when that happens.

204
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,679
Are the waves that big?

205
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,379
Yes, they're huge.

206
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
Is that it?

207
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:09,220
It looks quite different from the photos.

208
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,259
(It looks very different.)

209
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:17,230
(It's a thrilling ride over the emerald ocean.)

210
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,070
- The video was unrealistic. - I can do that.

211
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,500
- I can't ride the Nevis Swing. - I can.

212
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,070
It's much different in reality.

213
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:26,200
- Is it really scary? - Look at that.

214
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,370
(Welcome to Pantai Timang.)

215
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,379
(Will we be safe?)

216
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,750
Do you see what the locals prepared for you?

217
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,519
"Running Man".

218
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,350
They hung it for us.

219
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,750
(The locals made a welcome sign.)

220
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,419
- Really? - They made a sign.

221
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:45,159
- That's nice of them. - It's so cool.

222
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,629
- It's such a big welcome. - I know.

223
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,860
- We should be happy... - I'm grateful.

224
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,259
and try to enjoy it.

225
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,029
We can enjoy it, right?

226
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:56,169
Please do.

227
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,600
Let's go.

228
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,970
(Thank you, everyone.)

229
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,269
The waves are very strong.

230
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:01,740
(As soon as he tries to enjoy himself...)

231
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,379
I've never seem them so big.

232
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:05,179
They're unreal.

233
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:06,850
(They seem modified by a computer.)

234
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,850
Seriously.

235
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,549
- What's that bridge for? - That must be a bridge.

236
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,480
Do we cross the bridge?

237
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,490
No way.

238
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,389
This is the way.

239
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,259
You're at the penalty site after a long trip.

240
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:21,360
Yes, we are. This is the site of the accident.

241
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
(Do you see what's behind us?)

242
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:26,299
- In "Haeundae"... - We'll be on SBS News.

243
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:27,330
(It's not a movie.)

244
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,330
I've seen it before.

245
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,539
- Recommended by Syifa Amalina... - What?

246
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:33,840
- What did you say? - Say it again.

247
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,509
- The destination was recommended... - That's right.

248
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:37,779
by Syifa Amalina.

249
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:40,279
- Made with clotheslines and wood, - Clothesline?

250
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:42,250
it's a 100m Manual Wooden Cable Car.

251
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,379
Are these clotheslines?

252
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,950
Yes.

253
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,950
- They're real clotheslines? - Yes.

254
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,250
- Where we hang laundry? - Yes.

255
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:53,360
It's often used by fishermen to catch crayfish...

256
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,230
that lives near that small island.

257
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:59,700
It's not a tourist spot. It's used for transport.

258
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:01,629
It's to catch crayfish.

259
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:06,000
A net is laid out a day before to catch crayfish.

260
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,240
- It sounds delicious. - With the help of the village head,

261
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,940
we laid out a net.

262
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:13,779
Bring the crayfish in the net from the island.

263
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:16,879
What? I'm not a fisherman.

264
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,620
That's a professional task.

265
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,320
Bring the crayfish in the net.

266
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:23,620
As it's a wooden cable car, there's a weight limit.

267
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,860
You'll ride it separately.

268
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,460
Decide who will go first.

269
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:28,789
They can't go together?

270
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,659
Decide who will go first.

271
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,929
So Min will go first.

272
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:34,500
(Good luck, Kwang Soo.)

273
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,029
So Min?

274
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
No.

275
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,100
An ant bit me.

276
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,769
Look, I'm hurt.

277
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,580
An ant bit me.

278
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,879
- I have an ant bite. - I got injured here.

279
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,379
- An ant bite. - I got hurt.

280
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:48,480
It's a fire ant.

281
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,419
You should go first. I want to see how it is beforehand.

282
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,190
Gosh, look at that.

283
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,419
(The waves suddenly crash.)

284
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:00,789
The waves came all the way here.

285
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:03,129
Do you want to choose by Plus and Minus?

286
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,700
Shall we spin the roulette?

287
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,629
I pick plus.

288
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:08,299
You pick minus.

289
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,799
(He's in a turmoil.)

290
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:11,799
Pick one.

291
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:12,899
I pick plus.

292
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,039
(If So Min picks plus...)

293
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,210
Do you pick minus?

294
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:16,779
Yes.

295
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:17,840
(Kwang picks minus.)

296
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Here we go.

297
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,480
(Will it be So Min...)

298
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,320
(or Kwang Soo who goes first?)

299
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,389
(Unsurprisingly, it's Kwang Soo.)

300
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,120
(It's only natural.)

301
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,389
Kwang Soo will go first.

302
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,259
You know I wanted to go first, right?

303
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:37,500
- No. - Just remember that.

304
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,500
No way.

305
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,600
Even if it were a plus, I'd have gone first.

306
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,899
The waves have calmed down.

307
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,200
You should go now. The time is now.

308
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
(The waves calmed down?)

309
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,240
(That's not calm.)

310
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,080
- Gosh. - Look at the waves.

311
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,279
They look scary.

312
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:54,850
(Is the time now?)

313
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:59,149
(Kwang Soo mentally prepares himself.)

314
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:05,220
- We don't have much to carry... - My goodness.

315
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,320
(Screaming)

316
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,090
(Shrieking)

317
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:10,230
Goodness.

318
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,899
I can't do it.

319
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,600
- I can't do it. - I won't do it.

320
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,700
Gosh, they're in trouble.

321
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,700
(She's shocked by the waves.)

322
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,210
- That's frightening. - That's impossible.

323
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:24,309
(As Kwang Soo gets ready to go,)

324
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:28,080
(the waves frighten him at the perfect time.)

325
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,450
I won't do it.

326
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:31,580
- I won't do it. - I give up.

327
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,580
(He gives up.)

328
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:36,759
(The locals are used to the waves.)

329
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,629
(The waves are crashing down heavily.)

330
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:45,600
(Will he be able to go through the penalty today?)

331
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:49,129
Okay. All right.

332
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,240
(I can do this.)

333
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,039
- Look at the waves. - Everyone rides this.

334
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,470
- I bet you must've hated riding it. - From here...

335
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,179
(He says he can ride it, but he keeps going to the back.)

336
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:58,809
I can just sit there. That's all.

337
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,909
This is the same as spraying water on me when I'm sitting on a chair.

338
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:03,110
(This is just a common penalty.)

339
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,549
Let's go.

340
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,320
You can swim. You learned how to swim.

341
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,149
(He tells himself that he's a swimming prodigy.)

342
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,389
There's no way I'd fall into the sea.

343
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:14,059
(He's about to face the penalty after hesitating for 30 minutes.)

344
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,259
Kwang Soo, good luck!

345
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:17,429
(She sincerely roots for him.)

346
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:22,629
(It's time to end the long-lasting homework of the I-Go Project.)

347
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,539
- Should I go this way? - You want me to put this away?

348
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:26,639
Yes, just for a moment, please.

349
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,580
Please help me with this.

350
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,509
(Kwang Soo, the 1st one to face the penalty, gets on the cable car.)

351
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,149
Should I do this after lunch?

352
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:39,379
(Is it safe for me to ride this on an empty stomach?)

353
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,990
(No, I should get this over with quickly, right?)

354
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:49,730
(Tired of waiting, the spirit of variety shows slaps his cheeks.)

355
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,460
I don't think I can do this! I can't do this!

356
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:55,129
I lost!

357
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't think I can ride this cable car!

358
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:00,070
What a timing.

359
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,169
- This doesn't seem possible. - It looks like a skit, doesn't it?

360
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,049
(Oh, poor Kwang Soo. What an unfortunate timing!)

361
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:11,720
Did you see Kwang Soo?

362
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:14,419
(Giggling)

363
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:18,159
I want to go back to Korea!

364
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,490
(Mom...)

365
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:24,129
All right. Let's do this.

366
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:26,330
Let's go. I should get this over with.

367
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,730
Please move up a bit.

368
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,539
- Put this up. - Gosh, this is shaking.

369
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:32,799
- You can just put this up. - This is shaking.

370
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:34,340
(At the news of Kwang Soo's appearance,)

371
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,379
(the color of the waves begins to darken.)

372
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,009
(So many of my fans are watching me now.)

373
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,450
(He goes inside the cable car after 40 minutes.)

374
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,919
Go forward. Wait, no.

375
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:51,720
(He puts on the safety gear to prepare just in case.)

376
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,190
It fits perfectly.

377
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,429
This is...

378
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,230
Now that I'm sitting here...

379
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,230
I can't...

380
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,399
(What should I do?)

381
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,129
I can't do this now that I'm sitting here.

382
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,370
What's your name?

383
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,139
- I'm Murphy. Yes. - Murphy?

384
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:07,970
How old are you?

385
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:10,580
I'm 25 years old.

386
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:12,809
Tell him that I'm older than he is.

387
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:14,980
(He feels proud of his age.)

388
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,149
- He's older? - Yes.

389
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:17,419
- I see. - I'm older than you.

390
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:20,149
(I'm counting on you, Murphy. Don't forget I'm older than you.)

391
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:21,320
Be careful.

392
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,419
He told you to be careful.

393
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:25,720
Be careful? How can I be careful here?

394
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,330
How?

395
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,789
(I can't do anything here!)

396
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:34,230
(Murphy explains something to Kwang Soo.)

397
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,429
I speak Korean.

398
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,610
- I'm Korean. - It was calm for three days.

399
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,179
But today, the waves are big today. So you should grab the handle...

400
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:45,610
tightly because it might be dangerous.

401
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,220
It was calm for three days, but the waves got big just today?

402
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,350
No, that's not how it happened.

403
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,250
Kwang Soo made the sea angry.

404
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,990
Hold on. What did I do to upset the sea?

405
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:02,360
(But the sea does look like it's upset.)

406
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:06,029
(Screaming)

407
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,400
(He's completely soaked. This guy has upsetted Poseidon.)

408
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,670
Please. Please spare me!

409
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:19,509
(His misfortunes even upsetted the sea that had been calm.)

410
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:21,480
After Kwang Soo rode the cable car, the waves are crashing even harder.

411
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:22,980
So it's been confirmed.

412
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:25,680
He has the energy that upsets everyone.

413
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,019
The sea is very angry now.

414
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,990
Were you having fun?

415
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,519
(Feeling guilty)

416
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:33,390
- So Min, you had to ride that next. - Right.

417
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,190
- Right now, I can't laugh. - That looks so scary.

418
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,029
- That must be so terrifying. - Goodness, that cable car...

419
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:39,799
The waves were so big to the point that it was so weird.

420
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:42,869
Please. Please stop this!

421
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,940
Please stop the waves.

422
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:48,440
(But it can no longer be delayed as the waves are getting stronger.)

423
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:52,539
(I can do this.)

424
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,319
(The 1st one to face the penalty of I-Go Project)

425
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:59,750
(Kwang Soo sets out at last.)

426
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,490
Go!

427
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:04,759
(It stops.)

428
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:05,990
- What's going on? - Oh, dear!

429
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:07,460
- It's going. - He's going.

430
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,890
- What's going on? - Hey.

431
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,900
- Be careful! - What is it?

432
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,430
(Because of the cameras, it can't speed up.)

433
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,529
What's wrong?

434
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,069
It's shaking. The string got stretched because he's heavy.

435
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,599
The string is stretched out.

436
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,369
(When he's about to have a moment of peace,)

437
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:24,809
(the fierce waves visit him.)

438
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:28,710
(For Kwang Soo, the locals are speeding the process.)

439
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,980
(However, as he penetrates through the strong waves,)

440
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,420
(he begins to advance little by little.)

441
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,190
I'm sorry.

442
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,430
(He keeps on mumbling.)

443
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,859
What's happening to me now?

444
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,599
This is where I am after I regained my senses.

445
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,900
(Why am I here?)

446
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,099
I'm doomed.

447
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,140
My life is in ruins.

448
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:59,109
I should've removed Ji Hyo's name tag.

449
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:00,650
I should've done it at all cost.

450
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,880
(During the last race of I-Go Project,)

451
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,119
(things would have been different had I removed hers.)

452
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:07,750
I should've caught the king crabs.

453
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,250
- I should've done that in Russia. - Did you catch them?

454
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,759
(No, if only I caught the king crabs 5 months ago...)

455
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,460
(If only the king crabs were hanging at the end of my fishing line...)

456
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:19,960
(If only a king crab bit my bait by any chance...)

457
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:24,140
Where did I go wrong?

458
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:26,869
(Sighing in despair)

459
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:28,940
It must be after that time. No, it's not.

460
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,109
It started even before then.

461
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,509
(He begins to regret his past misfortunes as the waves flood in.)

462
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:36,779
I'm almost there. I'm almost there.

463
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:39,880
What a beautiful view. The scenery is dazzling.

464
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:42,819
This is pretty. How beautiful.

465
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,619
(The view is amazing.)

466
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:45,990
This is straight from a painting.

467
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:57,470
(At that time, the painting comes alive.)

468
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,039
Hold on!

469
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,339
(Gosh, that looks horrifying.)

470
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:02,440
This is... Oh, no.

471
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,140
Everyone was so surprised. They all screamed.

472
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,309
Kwang Soo disappeared for a second.

473
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,019
(He comes to his senses.)

474
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,880
Hold on!

475
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:20,930
(A helicopter camera was filming him.)

476
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,690
Oh, no! The helicopter camera!

477
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,259
Did you see the drone camera that just fell?

478
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:25,630
(The drone crashed down.)

479
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,869
- That's a helicopter camera. - It fell!

480
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:27,900
Oh, no!

481
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,299
- All the cameras turned off. - What's going on?

482
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:31,700
- Really? - The waves were just too big.

483
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,099
- It's all my fault! - Goodness.

484
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,210
It's just...

485
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,579
(While Kwang Soo is facing the waves that crashed the drone...)

486
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,619
It's all my fault.

487
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,079
It's dangerous.

488
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,420
I should put on suncream.

489
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,759
(She doesn't show much interest.)

490
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,690
Where is my bag? Would you like something to drink?

491
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,460
Do you want a drink?

492
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:00,799
- No? I'm rich. I have 100 dollars. - On which car did you leave it?

493
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,869
(Someone is shaking this cable car!)

494
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:08,109
Please!

495
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,480
Pull me back! Pull!

496
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:14,309
Hey, pull me back there! Come on!

497
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,150
It's coming again. Don't do it! Stop!

498
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:19,950
(Screaming in agony)

499
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:22,549
(He swears at Poseidon.)

500
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,859
(While Kwang Soo is doing this unforgettable activity...)

501
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:29,230
Where is she?

502
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,559
(So Min's "Backpack Travels")

503
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:32,960
Would you like to try this?

504
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,700
What is this?

505
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:36,769
(Longan is a tropical fruit from dry seasons.)

506
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:38,700
She told me to press it in the center.

507
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,509
This has a hint of garlic smell.

508
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:46,880
But the aftertaste is quite fruity, isn't it?

509
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,849
(Thus, she continued experiencing the culture.)

510
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,220
You weren't watching him?

511
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,890
When I turned back, that's how she looked. She crossed her legs.

512
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,190
(I'm sorry. I got scared watching you.)

513
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,430
I shouldn't have been chosen by the roulettes!

514
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:08,769
(Gosh, I can't believe I went through those waves.)

515
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:13,569
(Kwang Soo is soaked in waves, sweat, and tears.)

516
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:17,140
(Kwang Soo has reached the island on the other side.)

517
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,279
(Who am I?)

518
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,650
(Where am I?)

519
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:25,220
(At last, I feel much better. I am done with my penalty!)

520
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,319
(Kwang Soo, the 1st one to face the penalty,)

521
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:29,420
(reaches the island on the other side.)

522
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,990
(So Min, you're up next.)

523
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:35,529
I'm getting all nervous.

524
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:36,559
(Gosh, you did well.)

525
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,400
- But why do people... - The waves are crazy.

526
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:40,599
cross to the other side?

527
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,869
(Why do people cross to the other side?)

528
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:43,869
To catch shrimps.

529
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:45,170
- He told us that. - He already said that earlier.

530
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,009
He already told us that. Why are you talking about that again?

531
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:50,339
(You're so frustrating. Please listen to others.)

532
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:52,839
- For the locals there... - When?

533
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,309
Why are you keeping this a secret from me?

534
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,319
(Seok Jin is hilarious.)

535
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:59,079
But that's better than Nevis Swing.

536
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,819
(You're laughing now, Haha?)

537
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,759
- Jae Seok, please stop it. - I'm serious.

538
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,589
If you keep this up, he might stop filming.

539
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:08,329
- This is better in every aspect. - This is way better than that.

540
00:23:08,329 --> 00:23:09,559
(Compared to Nevis Swing, this is easy.)

541
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,460
All right, So Min. You'll get on the cable car now.

542
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,470
I ate too many fruits.

543
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:16,470
I think I should go to the bathroom.

544
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,670
Let me pray before I go.

545
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,170
(Please help me make a safe return.)

546
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,839
Hello.

547
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:24,980
(The 3rd question of Truth Game)

548
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,240
Thank you for your help.

549
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:30,750
(So Min finally gets on the cable car after a long wait.)

550
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,250
This is so high. This is higher than I expected.

551
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,119
(Seeing it up close makes her feel dizzy.)

552
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:38,359
What should I do?

553
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,460
(How did Kwang Soo ride this?)

554
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,289
(Question number 3)

555
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:45,430
(What did So Min hand Kwang Soo as soon as she finished the ride?)

556
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,430
- What? - What is it?

557
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,529
(It's the third question.)

558
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:51,339
(It's the 3rd question to determine who will take the penalty.)

559
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,240
(What did So Min hand Kwang Soo as soon as she finished the ride?)

560
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,240
All right, you two. Please come out...

561
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,880
and pick Truth or Lie.

562
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,180
What did she give?

563
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,779
(Only one of the two will tell them the truth.)

564
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:04,950
(The others must pick who's telling the truth to avoid the penalty.)

565
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,319
I really don't know.

566
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,920
I can't trust them anymore.

567
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,319
Who will speak first?

568
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,990
Can we listen to Kwang Soo first?

569
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,460
All right. I'll speak.

570
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:16,460
I picked Truth this time for certain.

571
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,900
- Is that right? - So Min handed me...

572
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,299
the fruit which she was eating a while ago.

573
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:24,099
(Kwang Soo claims that So Min gave him the fruit.)

574
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:28,369
(After riding that dangerous cable car,)

575
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:29,970
(So Min handed him the fruit?)

576
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,809
What nonsense is he talking about now?

577
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,450
- That's not funny at all. - What's wrong with you?

578
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,980
- This is the truth. - It's not funny.

579
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,049
I'm telling you the truth.

580
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:40,150
I only said two sentences just now.

581
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,420
Why on earth would she give you the fruit?

582
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,960
I'm telling you the truth.

583
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,519
- It was the fruit for certain. - Kwang Soo.

584
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:47,289
I trust you. I know you're telling the truth.

585
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,390
- Listen to me. - This isn't it.

586
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,500
- He's lying for certain. - Hey.

587
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,759
- Because... - Goodness.

588
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,029
Jong Kook isn't getting things right today.

589
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:56,769
As soon as I heard the question, I thought it was the fruit.

590
00:24:56,769 --> 00:24:58,599
- I thought it was the fruit too. - Listen to me.

591
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:00,670
There were fruits...

592
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,839
beside the entrance of the cable car.

593
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,710
What kind of fruit was it?

594
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:06,779
I had never seen that kind before.

595
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:07,880
- It was... - Was it dried or not?

596
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,019
- They were hanging on a tree. - He doesn't know...

597
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:11,849
- It was sweet and sour. - because he didn't have it.

598
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:13,519
(He had never seen it before, but it tasted sweet and sour.)

599
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:19,490
- I forgot its name. - All fruits are sweet and sour.

600
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,329
Are you kidding me?

601
00:25:21,329 --> 00:25:23,529
- It was yellow. - I know what it was.

602
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:25,329
- What was it? - I know what that was.

603
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:27,670
It was yellow,

604
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,269
and it tasted like grapes.

605
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:32,940
- One of them was like snake skin. - Right, right.

606
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,039
- What do you mean? - Say its color at the same time.

607
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,440
Tell us the color at the same time.

608
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:40,650
It's a fact that So Min had the fruit.

609
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,809
So why would she give you the fruit?

610
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:44,579
- It had a huge seed inside. - Listen to me.

611
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:47,220
- Why would I... - It's the fruit.

612
00:25:47,349 --> 00:25:49,390
- give him the fruit? - What did you give him then?

613
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,190
- You tell me then. - She wouldn't give him that.

614
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,220
- Tell us. - What did you give him?

615
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,460
Think of an idea quickly.

616
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,460
I swore at you.

617
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,930
(So Min claims that she gave him swear words.)

618
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:02,500
- You gave him swear words? - That wouldn't be aired then.

619
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,240
He shouted at me from the other side...

620
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,170
because he became upset...

621
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,940
that I enjoyed eating the fruit and watched him get the penalty.

622
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,039
He yelled at me from the other side.

623
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,309
So as soon as I got off, he went,

624
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:17,279
"You brat, you're dead meat."

625
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,480
What's that?

626
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,549
(Kwang Soo swore at So Min?)

627
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,349
(What is she talking about?)

628
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:23,960
It's all right if she lies, but...

629
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,559
Hold on.

630
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,690
Hold on. When did I...

631
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:30,960
- I didn't say that. - Goodness.

632
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,400
- Did I say that to you? - You're impossible.

633
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,799
- Did I? - Is this real?

634
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,839
- Is this real? - No, listen to me.

635
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,400
Does it make sense?

636
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,170
You helpless punk!

637
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,680
- How could you... - Gosh.

638
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,039
I'm sorry,

639
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,809
but why is Seok Jin upset?

640
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,380
I got upset too late.

641
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,180
I thought about it for some time, and it made me mad.

642
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,390
That was so sudden.

643
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,789
I became righteous all of a sudden.

644
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,759
I'm sure about this.

645
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,930
It's what Kwang Soo usually behaves.

646
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,359
So what did you give him?

647
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,259
- So what did you give him? - You'll find out soon.

648
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:06,769
So I gave him...

649
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:07,829
- You gave him the finger? - Yes.

650
00:27:07,829 --> 00:27:09,000
You'll know if you hear me.

651
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,740
That's what she'd do.

652
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,799
(It sounds about right.)

653
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,470
She often does that.

654
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:16,710
- You're right. - She often does that.

655
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,309
I'm getting goosebumps.

656
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:20,250
- My goodness. - A while ago,

657
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,809
- Haha guessed... - I didn't believe it at first.

658
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,019
the same thing.

659
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:27,049
- Because it's plausible. - He guessed this.

660
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,559
(Right after the question was given)

661
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:33,259
By any chance,

662
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,029
is it what I think it is?

663
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,029
Is it?

664
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:41,970
(Haha guessed if So Min gave him the bad finger.)

665
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:46,539
- Goodness. - She was...

666
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:48,269
She was too frightened...

667
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:50,380
- to give me such a thing. - Guys.

668
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,779
Listen to me.

669
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:55,549
You tend to comfort each other when you face some kind of trouble...

670
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,750
even though you're filming a variety show.

671
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,049
That's what I'm talking about.

672
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:01,690
I'm aware So Min is such a playful girl,

673
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,690
but she must've given him the fruit in that situation.

674
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,589
Hold on. I'm suspicious of one thing.

675
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:09,960
How did you know So Min was eating the fruit?

676
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:11,400
I watched it on TV.

677
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,000
(He was receiving the penalty, so how did he know?)

678
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,630
- Don't you think so? - You're right.

679
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,069
- I kept telling you this. - He's being suspicious.

680
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:20,039
How did you know what she was doing behind you?

681
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,309
- His eyesight is that good? - At that time,

682
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:23,809
I didn't know she was eating fruit.

683
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:25,079
- He couldn't see. - I only saw her...

684
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:27,549
- take selfies at that time. - He saw her take selfies.

685
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:29,150
- Right. - I saw that.

686
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:32,180
Because where I was wasn't that far from the other side.

687
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,190
Jae Seok must really not want to get penalized.

688
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,589
He's thinking so hard.

689
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:39,660
- He's never been... - He's being extra careful.

690
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,259
It was an important moment.

691
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:42,329
(If they can't guess this, they'll get closer to the penalty.)

692
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:44,559
It was the moment when she just finished her ride.

693
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,130
There's no way I swore at her at that moment.

694
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,470
You must be aware of how Kwang Soo usually behaves.

695
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,170
- You must all know. - Right.

696
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,299
- I had no strength either. - Think about it.

697
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:56,309
Do you think I crawled to her and swore at her?

698
00:28:56,809 --> 00:28:58,480
I had no strength to even walk.

699
00:28:58,539 --> 00:28:59,740
But I swore at her?

700
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,849
- Trust me. - I can't...

701
00:29:00,849 --> 00:29:03,109
trust either of them to be honest.

702
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:04,650
That's true.

703
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,250
Hold on, guys. You have to ride that one this time.

704
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,650
- Keep that in mind. - Guys, look behind you.

705
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,089
(So Min gave Kwang Soo the fruit or swear words?)

706
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:11,220
(Who's telling the truth?)

707
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,559
It's an extreme ride...

708
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,430
that you fly from 36m above the ground to the lake.

709
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,130
(Those who pick the wrong side will experience the big swing.)

710
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:22,869
(Who will get to fly across the sky like a moth that jumps into flames?)

711
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:25,640
- One. - Trust me this once.

712
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,309
We're in the same situation again.

713
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:28,470
(1 of the 2 will be exempted.)

714
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,640
You'll never get married in your life if you're lying.

715
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:30,880
- Are you still sure? - Yes.

716
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,109
(Whom will the members choose?)

717
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:33,410
All right. One.

718
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,309
(Whom will the members choose?)

719
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:36,349
Two.

720
00:29:36,349 --> 00:29:38,779
(Is it Kwang Soo or So Min?)

721
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,720
- Three. - It's so hard to decide.

722
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,390
(They're torn.)

723
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,490
I don't know.

724
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:47,660
(Turning)

725
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,660
(Only two chose So Min.)

726
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,500
- I really don't know. - They didn't give us enough time.

727
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,500
(Ji Hyo decides to trust So Min.)

728
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,529
(It's 4 to 2.)

729
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:56,769
Why?

730
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,039
Why don't you trust me?

731
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,069
I suspected Kwang Soo at first.

732
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:04,140
But he's persuasive.

733
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,339
He wouldn't have sworn at her when he just finished his penalty.

734
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:07,410
- Right? - He wouldn't have done that.

735
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,349
Only Ji Hyo and Se Chan chose to trust So Min.

736
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:11,819
- What? - Ji Hyo chose So Min?

737
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,250
Ji Hyo chose to trust me.

738
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,750
- I chose So Min. - Give us a final chance.

739
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,059
- Look at you. - Don't be swayed.

740
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:19,819
- Step away. - I'm telling you the truth.

741
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:20,960
- See? - Ji Hyo...

742
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,160
Don't be swayed.

743
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,160
- Why did she choose So Min? - I'm right.

744
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,460
Anyway, it's decided that So Min will get the penalty.

745
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,900
- I don't know. - Let's check the answer now.

746
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,869
(What's the truth behind this question?)

747
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,809
Hello.

748
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:38,839
Thank you in advance.

749
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,410
(So Min gets ready for the ride.)

750
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,750
(Frightened)

751
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,380
Wait a second.

752
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:48,720
This is much higher than expected.

753
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,960
Wait a second. This is much higher than expected.

754
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:57,700
(Kwang Soo must've felt this way a while ago.)

755
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,559
What should I do?

756
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
So Min!

757
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,970
So Min, you must come back.

758
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,740
(Focus!)

759
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,779
We must return home.

760
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:17,250
What is that on his head? Is it a jellyfish or what?

761
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,650
- It's my hair. - Is that seaweed?

762
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,490
- It's my real hair. - Oh, I see.

763
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:23,190
You must come back.

764
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,819
(His seaweed hairstyle captures attention.)

765
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,220
You can return home.

766
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,259
(It turns the Prince of Asia into a beggar.)

767
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:28,430
Let's go, So Min!

768
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,299
This is much scarier than I thought it'd be.

769
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:34,130
Gosh, this seems so fragile.

770
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:41,569
(It's difficult to even fit her body into the tiny space.)

771
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:42,809
It might break.

772
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:44,740
Gosh, it's frightening.

773
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,640
(Will she successfully finish the ride?)

774
00:31:47,549 --> 00:31:49,109
What if a wave hits me?

775
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,420
What should I do then?

776
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:58,789
(Welcome. It's your first time at Pantai Timang, isn't it?)

777
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:01,990
(She didn't realize it then.)

778
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:03,599
Be careful!

779
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,470
(I love Indonesia.)

780
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,569
(She had no idea then...)

781
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:15,410
(just how nice it was to relax and wait for Kwang Soo.)

782
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:18,940
(Now, she's sitting in the cable car.)

783
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,009
Okay.

784
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,210
Goodness, I don't think I can do this.

785
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,420
Goodness.

786
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:30,390
(She's about to enter the world of waves.)

787
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,029
(Nervous)

788
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:35,990
Be careful.

789
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,559
(She can't take it back anymore.)

790
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,069
What should I do? My goodness.

791
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,069
Hold on. Oh, no.

792
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,039
- Please. - That looks so scary.

793
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,210
- That's scary. - I'll never be able to do that.

794
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,279
Hold on. Oh, no.

795
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:53,750
Hold on.

796
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,420
Gosh, the waves.

797
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,450
Please don't come near me.

798
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:03,420
Please don't. Not the waves.

799
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,059
Please.

800
00:33:06,829 --> 00:33:09,789
(Will she get to avoid facing the waves as she wishes?)

801
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:11,130
Oh, no.

802
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,170
(It doesn't seem that bad.)

803
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,640
(It doesn't seem as bad this time.)

804
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,440
Here come the waves.

805
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,240
Gosh, the waves.

806
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:23,680
Oh, dear.

807
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,640
(What's going on?)

808
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,180
Let's go.

809
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,680
(Pantai Timang never disappoints you.)

810
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:36,549
(It's a gift only for So Min.)

811
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:39,420
(The waves are here again.)

812
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,029
After those waves?

813
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:43,089
She can't have sworn after those waves.

814
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:45,130
It was scary when it wobbled.

815
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,430
Those waves were huge.

816
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,869
They're so strong.

817
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,069
(Waves)

818
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:57,380
(Scary waves hit the cable car.)

819
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,779
(Screaming)

820
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:01,779
Gosh!

821
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:05,849
Gosh!

822
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,920
(Engulfed)

823
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:14,860
(What is this?)

824
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,190
I hate this.

825
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:20,800
(Wasn't she taking selfies and eating fruits until a moment ago?)

826
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:23,400
I hate this.

827
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,599
(Am I being punished for being too happy?)

828
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:25,940
Seriously.

829
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,340
I hate this so much.

830
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:32,380
(After a few big waves, So Min finally gets to the other side.)

831
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,780
(She's smiling again.)

832
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,550
(She's smiling now.)

833
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,579
Gosh.

834
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:42,949
Did you see how the car wobbled?

835
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:46,360
- Do you know how it was for me? - Did you see it?

836
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:48,889
- Are you okay? - Yes.

837
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:52,659
Excuse me. Sorry.

838
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:54,099
(So Min and Kwang Soo's cable car rides are finished.)

839
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:56,429
We have to go back, right?

840
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:57,699
Yes.

841
00:34:57,699 --> 00:34:59,199
(So Min is about to give something to Kwang Soo.)

842
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:01,210
- Kwang Soo. - It wasn't that bad.

843
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:03,070
(What is she going to give him?)

844
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,639
Kwang Soo might have said something to make her swear.

845
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:06,179
That's possible.

846
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:08,210
- Kwang Soo... - This is an important moment.

847
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,210
(What is she going to give him?)

848
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:12,480
- Kwang Soo. - It wasn't that bad.

849
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,949
(She takes something out.)

850
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,190
It wasn't that bad.

851
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:20,559
(If So Min swears to Kwang Soo, So Min is the truthful one.)

852
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,960
(If she gives Kwang Soo fruits, Kwang Soo is the truthful one.)

853
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,099
(What is she going to give him?)

854
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:32,699
(The correct answer is fruits.)

855
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:34,469
- Yes! - Yes!

856
00:35:34,469 --> 00:35:38,210
(So Min was lying.)

857
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,679
(So Min and those who believed her are going to be penalized.)

858
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:42,309
Of course, she didn't swear.

859
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:43,679
Of course.

860
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,079
It was wrong.

861
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,090
(We were fooled by So Min.)

862
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:50,420
- Of course, it was fruits. - By the way,

863
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,190
you guys are so sweet.

864
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,090
- I had never tried them. - It's so heartwarming.

865
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,030
- They're called lychees. - Throughout her ride,

866
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,300
she must have wanted to give the fruits to Kwang Soo.

867
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,199
- It's so sweet of her. - It's so heartwarming.

868
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:07,070
(She carried the fruits throughout her ride.)

869
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,670
(I'm going to give him fruits.)

870
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,710
So Min, it's so sweet of you.

871
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,079
What's this?

872
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,650
(She takes them out of her pocket.)

873
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,980
- What are all these? - They're fruits.

874
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:20,250
I brought them for you.

875
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,690
- Did you eat them? - Yes, I ate a lot.

876
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,659
(I brought them in my pocket for you.)

877
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:26,619
Don't eat the seed.

878
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,130
Eat the skin too. It tastes good, right?

879
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:31,059
Are you okay?

880
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:32,099
Yes, I am.

881
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:33,230
(She successfully delivered the fruits to Kwang Soo.)

882
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,929
- I'm okay. - Are you mentally okay?

883
00:36:35,929 --> 00:36:38,239
I actually panicked a little during the ride...

884
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,269
because...

885
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,869
(The waves crash again.)

886
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,840
The car wobbled during your ride too.

887
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,179
You were invisible for a moment.

888
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:48,679
When I looked back, you were looking at your phone.

889
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:51,550
You were sitting down, looking at your phone.

890
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,820
(That's not true.)

891
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:56,019
(Truth or Lie Quiz is finished.)

892
00:36:56,019 --> 00:36:58,219
- It brings back memories. - I don't want to go on that swing.

893
00:36:58,489 --> 00:36:59,659
Gosh.

894
00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:03,130
So Min, Se Chan, and Ji Hyo will receive penalty badges.

895
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,699
I'm doomed. I already have two.

896
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,800
(What have they done wrong?)

897
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,500
- Se Chan is doomed. - He is.

898
00:37:08,869 --> 00:37:10,440
- We don't know yet, right? - We don't.

899
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,300
Someone might get more than him.

900
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,369
Right. Gosh, that was a mistake.

901
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:15,570
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan get penalty badges.)

902
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,380
- So Min... - I'm sorry.

903
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,679
A cameraman has to be there too,

904
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:22,050
so only two people will ride the swing.

905
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,050
(Only 1 person will go on it.)

906
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,980
- Only 2 people total. - Only 1 of us?

907
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,050
All the cameramen look so shocked.

908
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,190
(A cameraman has to be there.)

909
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,760
Right?

910
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,289
(One of us will be there?)

911
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:36,929
Have the cameramen agreed on this?

912
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:39,559
Why don't our cameramen play rock-paper-scissors?

913
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:40,570
That sounds good.

914
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,500
- Let's do that. - Rock-paper-scissors.

915
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,699
The cameramen will play rock-paper-scissors.

916
00:37:43,699 --> 00:37:46,969
Se Chan, Ji Hyo, and So Min's cameramen, please come out.

917
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:49,469
Seong Oh hates these things.

918
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:51,739
Rock-paper-scissors. Ready.

919
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,980
(The loser will be penalized.)

920
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,010
Please.

921
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,280
(The cameramen will determine...)

922
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,119
(the members and their own fates.)

923
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:06,019
(The loser and a member will go on the swing.)

924
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:08,059
(Who will that be?)

925
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:12,429
(Se Chan, Ji Hyo, and So Min's cameramen)

926
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:14,699
(Ji Hyo's cameraman loses.)

927
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:17,599
All right! Yes!

928
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:24,309
(Chan Gyu and Ji Hyo are going to ride the swing.)

929
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:25,840
He's so bad.

930
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,349
- I was so surprised. - How is that possible?

931
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:32,480
Ji Hyo will ride the swing.

932
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:35,190
I'm escaping many dangers today.

933
00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:37,690
Ji Hyo, I didn't expect you to go on that swing.

934
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,489
Neither did I.

935
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:43,329
(I didn't expect it either.)

936
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:44,329
Ji Hyo.

937
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:46,099
(Are you okay?)

938
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:51,300
(I miss my mom.)

939
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,909
Why did you lose?

940
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,679
Why did you lose rock-paper-scissors?

941
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,650
(Sorry)

942
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:04,050
(It's not enough to be the lucky one yourself.)

943
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,050
It's at least better than Nevis Swing.

944
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:11,119
Maybe it's a good thing.

945
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,389
- Ji Hyo is the only one... - Ji Hyo is the only one...

946
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:14,429
- who can do this. - who can do this.

947
00:39:14,429 --> 00:39:15,860
Among all of us.

948
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,300
She's the bravest one.

949
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,260
She's my hero.

950
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:27,340
(She did the 233m bungee jump in Macau.)

951
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:32,179
(She's successfully managed many extreme sports.)

952
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:35,079
(Ji Hyo is the queen of extreme sports.)

953
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:37,179
(You're the only one who can smile in this situation.)

954
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:38,849
Ji Hyo.

955
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:42,019
Are you okay?

956
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:45,719
I'm scared too.

957
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:48,889
Just so you know, Bo Gum has done it.

958
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:50,860
- He has? - Really?

959
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,900
That's great.

960
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:58,500
(Bo Gum is Ji Hyo's favorite.)

961
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,010
(She was so thrilled when she took a picture with him.)

962
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:05,579
(If Bo Gum was with me,)

963
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:09,909
(I could do it a hundred times.)

964
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:14,650
(Sorry, I'm the one who will be with you.)

965
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,920
You look great.

966
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,860
You look fantastic.

967
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,960
(Thumbs up)

968
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,960
This is crazy.

969
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,969
(The swing ascends.)

970
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:33,840
Mom, Dad, friends, Running Man members,

971
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,070
and the staff,

972
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:38,739
thank you for everything.

973
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,579
(Why is she making a confession?)

974
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:43,579
Chan Gyu, I don't blame you.

975
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:44,679
(We're in this together.)

976
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,219
We can do this.

977
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,989
Ji Hyo, are you okay?

978
00:40:48,389 --> 00:40:50,159
I don't know. I'm scared.

979
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,219
Ji Hyo!

980
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:53,320
It's going up so high.

981
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:55,690
It's going up too high.

982
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,159
(My goodness.)

983
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:59,159
Gosh, it's too high.

984
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:02,329
This is not okay!

985
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,440
- Ji Hyo. - I can't watch it.

986
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,739
How high is it going?

987
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,639
Gosh.

988
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:11,840
Are we there?

989
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,110
You can do this!

990
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,849
(Screaming)

991
00:41:15,579 --> 00:41:16,579
(Jae Seok's legs fail him.)

992
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:17,579
Gosh.

993
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,320
We'll count down for you.

994
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,320
(Countdown)

995
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:27,289
- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

996
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:28,489
Let's go!

997
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:32,329
(Launching)

998
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:36,869
(Plunging)

999
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,139
(Screaming)

1000
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:43,139
(Cutting through the wind,)

1001
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:45,909
(the swing plunges.)

1002
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:51,079
(Shocked)

1003
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:52,219
(It comes back at an incredible speed too.)

1004
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,250
Gosh.

1005
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:56,690
(It comes back at an incredible speed too.)

1006
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,690
(Ji Hyo is smiling.)

1007
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,530
(So is the cameraman.)

1008
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:02,960
(They're both so brave.)

1009
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,130
They're not even screaming.

1010
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:09,199
(The others are holding their breaths as they watch.)

1011
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:12,800
- This is crazy. - It's incredible.

1012
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,539
You look like Wonder Woman.

1013
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:19,480
Superman!

1014
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:22,449
- Superman! - Superman!

1015
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:26,280
(Mapo-gu is under my protection.)

1016
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:29,289
We survived.

1017
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,559
- We're still alive. - That's amazing.

1018
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:34,289
- We survived. - Ji Hyo, you're amazing.

1019
00:42:34,489 --> 00:42:36,389
- We're still alive! - Superman!

1020
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:37,400
(Ji Hyo is incredible.)

1021
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,059
Superman.

1022
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:40,869
I have so much respect for you.

1023
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:43,840
A big respect for you.

1024
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,170
It's you guys next time.

1025
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,969
- You're going on Nevis Swing. - I respect you.

1026
00:42:48,969 --> 00:42:50,079
I respect you.

1027
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,079
- I respect you. - You're going on Nevis Swing.

1028
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,380
Which was scarier, bungee jumping in Macau or this?

1029
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,780
This was a bit scarier.

1030
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,179
- Really? - Really?

1031
00:42:57,579 --> 00:42:59,119
It must be really scary.

1032
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,019
If Ji Hyo says so...

1033
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,119
We survived.

1034
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,219
(They've safely landed.)

1035
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:05,260
We're still alive.

1036
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:08,190
(Ji Hyo's swing ride is finished.)

1037
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,929
- Let me summarize it for you. - Okay.

1038
00:43:11,929 --> 00:43:14,670
Se Chan has the most penalty badges.

1039
00:43:14,969 --> 00:43:17,900
- He has three. - He's doomed.

1040
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,539
(Se Chan is likely to be penalized.)

1041
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:23,070
So Min and Jong Kook have two badges each.

1042
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:25,079
The other members have one each.

1043
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,210
There's only one more person who has two.

1044
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,179
I'm at risk.

1045
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:30,579
Is it decided that I'll be penalized?

1046
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:32,119
We don't know yet.

1047
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:34,590
- We don't? - No. Those with two badges...

1048
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:36,250
- might receive more. - That's right.

1049
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,420
That's right.

1050
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,190
She and I should give different answers.

1051
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:40,389
- That's right. - We should give different answers.

1052
00:43:40,389 --> 00:43:42,090
Think about this.

1053
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:43,699
If the two of you answer correctly...

1054
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,059
and the ones with 1 badge come to have 2 badges,

1055
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:47,230
- 4 people will compete. - 4 people will have 2 badges each.

1056
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:48,929
- Okay. - That makes sense.

1057
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,900
In that case, what does the one with three badges do?

1058
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,900
If that happens, the one with three badges,

1059
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,940
you, will choose among the ones with two badges.

1060
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,079
- Do I get to choose? - Yes.

1061
00:43:57,639 --> 00:43:59,780
- That's a good idea. - Let's get it.

1062
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,079
Here comes the fourth problem.

1063
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:05,280
Play the video.

1064
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:08,349
(Tiger Moth Penalty Tour, The 4th problem)

1065
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,219
Let's go and get crayfish.

1066
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:11,659
- What does crayfish look like? - Wait for me, Kwang Soo.

1067
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:13,960
- I wonder what it looks like. - Doesn't it look fragile?

1068
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:15,190
You will be surprised when you see it.

1069
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,630
- Why? Is it because it's big? - It's my first time seeing it.

1070
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,099
- It's my first time seeing it. - It's incredible.

1071
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:20,670
- This place looks cool. - It's a cave.

1072
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:21,929
- It looks cool. - Is it a cave?

1073
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:23,500
(Are the crayfish here?)

1074
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,500
It's fascinating how people made this structure.

1075
00:44:26,869 --> 00:44:28,239
- There is a crab. - It must be here.

1076
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:29,969
- Crayfish live there. - This must be it.

1077
00:44:29,969 --> 00:44:32,340
There were crabs too.

1078
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,409
- There is a crab. - This must be it.

1079
00:44:34,849 --> 00:44:36,510
There is crayfish.

1080
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:38,920
Where?

1081
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:42,289
Is that crayfish? It looks like a lobster.

1082
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,960
- It looks like a lobster. - Is this crayfish?

1083
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,519
Why is it so big?

1084
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:49,789
- Isn't that a lobster? - It's crayfish.

1085
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:52,559
- It's huge. - It is.

1086
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,429
- That's crayfish? - Yes.

1087
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,039
There are two crabs.

1088
00:44:57,039 --> 00:44:59,539
(The local fisherman gives them the crabs too.)

1089
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,139
Wait a minute.

1090
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:04,710
This is "The Law of Jungle".

1091
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:05,909
(I've seen this somewhere.)

1092
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:08,280
It really is "The Law of Jungle".

1093
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,880
It would have been complete with Kim Byung Man.

1094
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:14,489
(Kwang Soo and So Min succeed in catching crayfish and crabs.)

1095
00:45:14,489 --> 00:45:15,789
- My goodness. - There are two crabs.

1096
00:45:15,989 --> 00:45:18,119
- The color is different. - That's a lobster.

1097
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:19,289
- How pretty! - No, it's crayfish.

1098
00:45:19,289 --> 00:45:20,389
- Is that crayfish? - Look at this.

1099
00:45:20,389 --> 00:45:22,789
It's hanging on to the trap.

1100
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,059
I have never seen this kind of a crab before.

1101
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,699
(Hello, crabs with a blue carapace.)

1102
00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:27,130
They look like a porcelain.

1103
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,170
- Thank you so much. - It's a lobster.

1104
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,139
- It doesn't look like crayfish. - That one is on the small side.

1105
00:45:34,139 --> 00:45:36,940
You are watching Running Man.

1106
00:45:39,409 --> 00:45:41,280
(Do you want to see crab roe?)

1107
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,280
- It's roe. - It has roe.

1108
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:45,179
(It is filled with roe.)

1109
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:46,219
(Telur means "Roe".)

1110
00:45:46,989 --> 00:45:48,289
- Did he say, "Daughter"? - May we try it now?

1111
00:45:48,289 --> 00:45:49,849
It's a daughter, not a son.

1112
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:51,219
It means "Roe".

1113
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:53,090
Daughters.

1114
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:55,130
I am sorry.

1115
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,900
This crab is foaming.

1116
00:45:58,929 --> 00:46:00,030
May we try it now?

1117
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:01,969
Do you want to try it raw?

1118
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:03,400
Crab roe can be eaten raw.

1119
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,400
Can crab roe be eaten raw?

1120
00:46:06,809 --> 00:46:08,739
While it tastes a bit fishy, you can eat it raw.

1121
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:10,480
While it tastes a bit fishy, you can eat it raw.

1122
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,840
(This is how you eat it.)

1123
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:14,780
You should try it.

1124
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:16,820
How fascinating!

1125
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:17,880
Try it.

1126
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,320
This is my first time seeing crab roe like this.

1127
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,420
(He carefully gives it a taste.)

1128
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,690
- How does it taste? - It's delicious. It tastes nutty.

1129
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:26,730
Is it delicious?

1130
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:27,829
- Did it taste nutty? - It was good.

1131
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:29,659
- Wasn't it salty? - It was nutty.

1132
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:31,230
- It's good, right? - Yes.

1133
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,159
I have seen this scene from somewhere.

1134
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:36,840
It was "The Law of Jungle".

1135
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,599
It was "The Law of Jungle".

1136
00:46:41,309 --> 00:46:43,139
People on that program look dirty...

1137
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:45,309
because they can't take a shower.

1138
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:47,679
You can't say that just because I touched a crab.

1139
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,809
This is fascinating. They are really pretty.

1140
00:46:50,019 --> 00:46:51,119
- Let's go. - Do we need to carry them?

1141
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,320
Let's get going.

1142
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,949
I don't think that part is edible.

1143
00:46:53,949 --> 00:46:56,250
- Are we taking the cable car? - Yes, we are.

1144
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,289
(Are we taking the cable car?)

1145
00:46:59,289 --> 00:47:01,460
How are we going back?

1146
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:03,500
I don't want to go on it.

1147
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,699
The waves were really scary. There are no waves under the bridge.

1148
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,500
(I prefer walking across the bridge.)

1149
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,929
Try walking on the bridge.

1150
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,199
If it's okay, I will follow you.

1151
00:47:15,409 --> 00:47:17,010
(The producer goes first.)

1152
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,179
He is going.

1153
00:47:23,179 --> 00:47:25,119
Let's go. This is better.

1154
00:47:26,789 --> 00:47:29,150
Kwang Soo is a man.

1155
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:30,519
He takes the lead.

1156
00:47:30,659 --> 00:47:32,420
This is my choice.

1157
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,960
(He charges forward like a man.)

1158
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,699
(There is nothing scary about a short walk.)

1159
00:47:42,469 --> 00:47:43,500
It's shaky.

1160
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:45,269
It's shaky.

1161
00:47:45,269 --> 00:47:47,639
(The spirited man who took the lead turns back.)

1162
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:49,610
The bridge is shaky.

1163
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:50,610
Really?

1164
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,750
Si Yeon, you should go first.

1165
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:56,079
You should go first.

1166
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,019
Don't add weight to the bridge.

1167
00:47:58,550 --> 00:47:59,849
- Seriously. - Hurry up.

1168
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:01,550
(Why do these combinations look familiar?)

1169
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:02,690
She wants you to go first.

1170
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:04,219
She wants you to go first.

1171
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:10,530
(Kwang Soo and Yoon Sang were a duo at Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

1172
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:19,539
(So Min and Si Yeon were a duo with a tearful welcoming ceremony.)

1173
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:23,380
She wants you to go first.

1174
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:27,210
- Come on. - I can't take a follow shot.

1175
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:28,550
(I am too scared.)

1176
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:31,050
- Come on. - I can't do it.

1177
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:33,889
Don't move all at once.

1178
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,619
Come on.

1179
00:48:35,619 --> 00:48:39,320
(The junior cameraman, Si Yeon, moves forward in the end.)

1180
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:42,789
Don't look down. Don't look down.

1181
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,800
Go quickly because I am scared.

1182
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:47,300
(Don't look back either, So Min.)

1183
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,500
I am sorry for suggesting to take this route.

1184
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:54,039
(He walks back because he is scared.)

1185
00:48:54,039 --> 00:48:56,840
(This route isn't any easier.)

1186
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,739
It's really windy.

1187
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,480
I won't go this way.

1188
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,909
(I am sorry. You should go ahead.)

1189
00:49:01,909 --> 00:49:03,519
No, I won't go this way.

1190
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,449
(An angry wave intimidates the tiger moths.)

1191
00:49:05,449 --> 00:49:07,289
The wave is so big.

1192
00:49:07,289 --> 00:49:08,690
It came up as high as the bridge.

1193
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:11,090
I won't go this way.

1194
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:13,019
Let's go. Let's go.

1195
00:49:13,929 --> 00:49:16,230
- We must go when the sea is calm. - What should I do?

1196
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,159
What should I do? The bridge is shaking.

1197
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:19,960
For goodness' sake.

1198
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,929
(With Kwang Soo's encouragement, she gathers up her courage.)

1199
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:27,639
(I don't think I am ready for this.)

1200
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:34,550
(He is going back from the middle.)

1201
00:49:39,949 --> 00:49:41,150
(If you can't avoid it, overcome it.)

1202
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:42,619
What should I do?

1203
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:43,989
What should I do?

1204
00:49:43,989 --> 00:49:46,289
(Let's pick up the pace and cross the bridge quickly.)

1205
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,659
You are almost there. Stay strong just a while longer.

1206
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:00,070
Go quickly. Go quickly.

1207
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:01,340
Go quickly.

1208
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:05,739
(They finally reach the land.)

1209
00:50:05,739 --> 00:50:06,880
How scary!

1210
00:50:07,309 --> 00:50:09,550
My legs are shaking.

1211
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,219
It was so scary.

1212
00:50:11,219 --> 00:50:13,389
(Kwang Soo is coming safely, right?)

1213
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:15,150
Are you okay?

1214
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,889
(No, I am not.)

1215
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:20,260
- My hands are shaking. - I think I lost weight.

1216
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:25,360
(The duo of scared men is at a standstill.)

1217
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:28,170
(I can't take a step forward.)

1218
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,969
(They remain standing on the bridge for a long time.)

1219
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:35,340
- I have no strength. - I used up all my energy.

1220
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:38,210
- My legs are shaking. - I used up three days' worth of it.

1221
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:41,179
Now, it's time to try...

1222
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:43,079
crayfish of Indonesia.

1223
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:44,550
- Crayfish. - Crayfish.

1224
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:45,880
(Come on, crayfish.)

1225
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:49,889
(It's time for the seafood party they've been dreaming of.)

1226
00:50:50,989 --> 00:50:52,360
I wonder how it tastes.

1227
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,659
I can't describe it with words.

1228
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:55,159
My goodness.

1229
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:56,429
- How pretty! - The crabs are so pretty.

1230
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:57,860
- They're not seasoned. - They are really pretty.

1231
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,070
You will see that we have brought your luggage.

1232
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:02,130
Yes.

1233
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:04,269
(It's the luggage they have forgotten about.)

1234
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,469
From your luggage,

1235
00:51:06,469 --> 00:51:10,210
please choose and bring two items you need.

1236
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,679
- Right now? - Two items each?

1237
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:14,679
Two items each.

1238
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:15,710
(We are on Tiger Moth Tour.)

1239
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:17,719
(The person with the higher amount of mission money remaining wins.)

1240
00:51:17,719 --> 00:51:19,219
Don't you think you should give us a change of clothes?

1241
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:22,150
- I need a change of clothes. - We need that much.

1242
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,320
(Taking out an item from the luggage costs 30 dollars.)

1243
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:25,159
(Kwang Soo opens his luggage.)

1244
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:26,420
You have so many clothes.

1245
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,789
(What should I take out?)

1246
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,360
How much time do we have?

1247
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:33,800
For goodness' sake.

1248
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:36,699
(Why do I need to do this?)

1249
00:51:36,699 --> 00:51:37,869
For goodness' sake.

1250
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,269
He is truly annoyed.

1251
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:41,969
Kwang Soo, children are watching. Calm down.

1252
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:43,739
It's nothing.

1253
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,309
Look at that fake smile.

1254
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:47,449
Kwang Soo.

1255
00:51:47,909 --> 00:51:48,980
(Don't be mad, Kwang Soo.)

1256
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,820
Take out what you need.

1257
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:52,849
(What should I take out?)

1258
00:51:52,849 --> 00:51:54,820
Take out what you need. My goodness, there is ramyeon.

1259
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,949
In that situation,

1260
00:51:56,519 --> 00:51:58,590
- ramyeon was the best. - Of course it was.

1261
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:00,260
- Let's get ramyeon. - There's ramyeon.

1262
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:02,659
Let's take out ramyeon. I really want it.

1263
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:04,059
- Ramyeon? - Yes.

1264
00:52:04,059 --> 00:52:07,170
I need a top and a bottom.

1265
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:08,199
You took this out already.

1266
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:09,800
Let's pay 15 dollars each to take out ramyeon.

1267
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,869
We are going to eat it together anyway.

1268
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,010
We will pay 15 dollars each for ramyeon.

1269
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:18,579
Let's pay 15 dollars each to take out ramyeon.

1270
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:19,809
- Where is my t-shirt? - Currently,

1271
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:21,809
So Min has 155 dollars.

1272
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:23,210
You shouldn't reveal that.

1273
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,750
Kwang Soo has 88 dollars.

1274
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:27,050
I won't pay for ramyeon.

1275
00:52:27,889 --> 00:52:28,920
I won't eat it.

1276
00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:30,920
Are you sure about that?

1277
00:52:31,289 --> 00:52:32,489
- Yes. - You said you won't eat it.

1278
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,159
I will pay 30 dollars to take out ramyeon.

1279
00:52:34,329 --> 00:52:35,429
- 30 dollars. - Yes.

1280
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:36,530
Don't eat it.

1281
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:38,659
Shoes.

1282
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,960
Kwang Soo.

1283
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,670
- Shoes and clothes. - A pack of clothes and shoes.

1284
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:46,139
- So Min. - I will take out...

1285
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:48,570
a top and a bottom.

1286
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:50,239
I will pay for ramyeon.

1287
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:53,139
A t-shirt, a pair of pants, and ramyeon for 30 dollars.

1288
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:55,010
- Yes. - You paid for it.

1289
00:52:55,309 --> 00:52:56,780
We will now close the luggage.

1290
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,519
(Taking out the 2 items comes to an end.)

1291
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:01,190
- Let's go and eat. - Let's go.

1292
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:04,590
- Please bring them in. - Please bring them in.

1293
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:06,489
(Since they worked hard to catch them,)

1294
00:53:06,489 --> 00:53:10,400
(they are that much happier to finally eat crayfish.)

1295
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,630
It looks so good.

1296
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,000
Seriously.

1297
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,900
- It looks tasty. - I can't describe it with words.

1298
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,570
Were they steamed without any sauce?

1299
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:18,670
Yes. There is a sauce for dipping.

1300
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:19,769
- Really? - Yes.

1301
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,539
- Is this the one I caught earlier? - Yes.

1302
00:53:21,539 --> 00:53:22,769
The color of the crabs changed.

1303
00:53:22,769 --> 00:53:24,880
They look like regular crabs when they are steamed.

1304
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:27,150
They are the ones we saw earlier.

1305
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:28,309
(The crabs return to them after getting steamed.)

1306
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:30,280
- Before you dig in... - Yes.

1307
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,320
- It looks delicious. - You see the crayfish...

1308
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,719
- on a small plate, right? - Yes.

1309
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,889
Try that first.

1310
00:53:35,889 --> 00:53:36,960
This?

1311
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,889
- What's happening? - The tiny one.

1312
00:53:38,889 --> 00:53:39,889
This?

1313
00:53:39,889 --> 00:53:40,929
It's not a crayfish?

1314
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:43,559
It is. Try it.

1315
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:46,599
Be careful not to hurt your hands.

1316
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:48,199
Look at all that flesh.

1317
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,369
- You caught it? - It was a bit small.

1318
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:52,500
(Soft flesh is hiding inside the hard shell.)

1319
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,739
It must be expensive.

1320
00:53:53,969 --> 00:53:56,170
- It was so tasty. - It looks so tasty.

1321
00:53:56,739 --> 00:53:58,840
It looks so tasty.

1322
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,679
It deserves a thumbs-up.

1323
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:01,679
- This? - Yes.

1324
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:02,750
(It's a gift from the sea.)

1325
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,280
It feels like we're in a jungle.

1326
00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:07,719
You should pay for that trip.

1327
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:09,889
- Totally. - It's not a penalty.

1328
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,360
Thank you.

1329
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:16,360
- How does it taste? - It tastes great.

1330
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,429
It's so fresh.

1331
00:54:17,429 --> 00:54:18,599
(The taste is fabulous.)

1332
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,400
It has so much flesh.

1333
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:27,139
(It's steak from the sea.)

1334
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:28,809
Look at this.

1335
00:54:28,809 --> 00:54:30,880
(Let me try some.)

1336
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,280
That looks like a lobster.

1337
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,380
It's so tasty.

1338
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:35,849
You should dip it in sauce.

1339
00:54:38,619 --> 00:54:40,289
- It gave me goosebumps. - It tastes amazing.

1340
00:54:40,289 --> 00:54:41,289
But...

1341
00:54:42,949 --> 00:54:45,360
for some reason, Kwang Soo doesn't make it look appetizing.

1342
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,159
- He doesn't make it appetizing. - Look at it closely.

1343
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:51,699
(Kwang Soo doesn't make food look appetizing.)

1344
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,500
It tastes like meat.

1345
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,300
(They're enjoying meat from the sea.)

1346
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,500
It has so much flesh. I've never tasted anything like this.

1347
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,809
The texture is so nice.

1348
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:03,039
Does it taste good?

1349
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:04,380
It tastes fantastic.

1350
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:05,380
(It's beyond words.)

1351
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,610
- The tasting session is over. - Sorry?

1352
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:09,809
I knew it.

1353
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,849
(Shocked)

1354
00:55:11,849 --> 00:55:14,590
Are you trying to be mean?

1355
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:17,059
What's happening?

1356
00:55:17,059 --> 00:55:18,059
(Why are they taking it from us?)

1357
00:55:18,059 --> 00:55:19,860
How is this different from "12 Years a Slave"?

1358
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,489
How is it different?

1359
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,329
You're tasting crayfish.

1360
00:55:26,329 --> 00:55:27,469
(The producer gets to the point.)

1361
00:55:27,469 --> 00:55:29,800
It's quite rare in Yogyakarta too. Even locals...

1362
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,000
- It must be. - don't get to taste it often.

1363
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,869
Even locals don't get to taste it often.

1364
00:55:33,869 --> 00:55:36,210
You can choose to either retrieve some of your items...

1365
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:38,179
or eat some more food.

1366
00:55:38,179 --> 00:55:41,579
Would you like to retrieve two of your items...

1367
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:43,280
or eat more crayfish?

1368
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,679
If you choose crayfish,

1369
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:47,849
you can continue to eat.

1370
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:49,150
(If they give up on their items, they can eat more.)

1371
00:55:49,489 --> 00:55:52,090
- Just eat. - I choose my clothes.

1372
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:55,260
(So Min chooses clothes over crayfish.)

1373
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,590
What are you going to choose?

1374
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,599
- What will Kwang Soo choose? - What are you going to choose?

1375
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:00,530
- You should choose crayfish. - He'll choose crayfish.

1376
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:02,269
- I choose... - He'll choose crayfish.

1377
00:56:02,269 --> 00:56:04,670
- He definitely will. - I'm 100 percent sure.

1378
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:06,080
I choose crayfish.

1379
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,780
(Crayfish)

1380
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:09,180
You choose crayfish.

1381
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:13,280
Kwang Soo will continue to eat then.

1382
00:56:13,479 --> 00:56:15,019
I have no clothes.

1383
00:56:15,019 --> 00:56:16,620
Can I continue to eat?

1384
00:56:16,789 --> 00:56:18,050
Not everyone gets to taste it.

1385
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:19,589
- Right. - The flesh is...

1386
00:56:19,589 --> 00:56:21,589
- seasoned. - Really?

1387
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:24,760
(That looks tasty.)

1388
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:31,399
(It looks like she is breaking up with someone.)

1389
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:33,300
Can he even eat that?

1390
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,439
(Amazed)

1391
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:38,010
(There is so much meat.)

1392
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:41,080
My hands are big.

1393
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,109
(I should have been there.)

1394
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:45,479
(Amazed)

1395
00:56:45,479 --> 00:56:47,950
I choose crayfish.

1396
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:50,149
(So Min changes her mind immediately.)

1397
00:56:50,149 --> 00:56:51,189
- Me too. - What's this?

1398
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,760
I choose crayfish.

1399
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:55,490
- Make up your mind. - I don't need clothes.

1400
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,560
- Okay. - Let's have it together.

1401
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,430
Let's share it. I can't help it.

1402
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:02,330
- I have no choice. - You can't do this.

1403
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:03,530
I was wrong.

1404
00:57:03,769 --> 00:57:05,229
(Excited)

1405
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,609
It's incredible.

1406
00:57:09,609 --> 00:57:11,010
(It's dipped in chili sauce.)

1407
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:15,010
(A big bite)

1408
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:16,649
(Her eyes become big.)

1409
00:57:16,649 --> 00:57:18,379
- It tastes amazing. - Gosh.

1410
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:20,180
It tastes so good.

1411
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:22,850
That looks amazing. How did it taste?

1412
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:23,990
It tasted amazing.

1413
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,289
You forgot about your penalty.

1414
00:57:26,289 --> 00:57:27,859
It was just...

1415
00:57:27,859 --> 00:57:28,959
It hasn't been frozen.

1416
00:57:28,959 --> 00:57:31,589
It was 1 of the 5 tastiest foods I'd ever had.

1417
00:57:31,589 --> 00:57:32,600
- Really? - Yes.

1418
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,499
(They fall in love with the taste of the crayfish.)

1419
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,300
It tastes amazing.

1420
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,169
(It's Kwang Soo's turn.)

1421
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:44,470
Is this chili sauce?

1422
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:48,280
(He skillfully removes the flesh and dips it in sauce.)

1423
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,780
It tastes so good.

1424
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:53,120
Has his face been enlarged?

1425
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,919
It looks longer than before.

1426
00:57:54,919 --> 00:57:56,890
You look so ugly.

1427
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,819
He looks like a horse.

1428
00:57:59,319 --> 00:58:00,789
The flesh is so soft.

1429
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:02,390
It melts in your mouth.

1430
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:04,930
They all taste different.

1431
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:07,160
It's amazing.

1432
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,260
I've seen this somewhere.

1433
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,430
Isn't this "Youn's Kitchen"?

1434
00:58:12,399 --> 00:58:13,999
(They're having food on the beach.)

1435
00:58:13,999 --> 00:58:15,069
Isn't this "Youn's Kitchen"?

1436
00:58:15,069 --> 00:58:16,569
(They're having food on the beach.)

1437
00:58:16,569 --> 00:58:17,839
You're Shin Gu.

1438
00:58:19,109 --> 00:58:21,140
- He's Shin Gu. - You're Youn Yuh Jung.

1439
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,680
Jung Yu Mi is not here.

1440
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:25,149
(You're watching Running Man.)

1441
00:58:25,149 --> 00:58:27,950
The flesh is so chewy.

1442
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:29,419
(Their stomachs are filling up.)

1443
00:58:29,419 --> 00:58:31,890
I've never filled my mouth with shrimp before.

1444
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:33,390
(Slurping)

1445
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:34,390
This is the first time.

1446
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:38,129
(So Min is slurping 30-dollar noodles.)

1447
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:42,830
I feel pain in my chest.

1448
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:44,100
- Why? - I don't know.

1449
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,600
Isn't it because of instant noodles?

1450
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,410
- No. - Are you okay?

1451
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:50,410
(Can I have some?)

1452
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:53,479
I'm sorry, but I can't give you any.

1453
00:58:53,479 --> 00:58:54,479
(It cost 30 dollars.)

1454
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,580
I gave up on my clothes.

1455
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:01,749
(Kwang Soo uses crayfish to lure her.)

1456
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,089
It's filled with flesh.

1457
00:59:05,089 --> 00:59:06,589
Let me have a bite.

1458
00:59:06,589 --> 00:59:09,060
- I'll have a bite first. - Okay.

1459
00:59:09,289 --> 00:59:10,789
Let me have a bite of your noodles.

1460
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:13,200
(So Min's in a dilemma.)

1461
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:15,899
(Check this out.)

1462
00:59:15,899 --> 00:59:17,600
- I'm tired. - Look at this.

1463
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,439
That looks so tasty.

1464
00:59:19,439 --> 00:59:20,870
Let me have a bite of your noodles.

1465
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:22,169
(Desperate)

1466
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:23,870
Fine.

1467
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:24,939
(You can have a bite.)

1468
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,709
Let me have a bite of your noodles.

1469
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,879
(So Min gets to have a bite of the crayfish.)

1470
00:59:32,419 --> 00:59:33,950
Did her tooth just fall out?

1471
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:35,519
Right.

1472
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:36,519
Have just one bite.

1473
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:39,319
(Kwang Soo gets to try the noodles.)

1474
00:59:39,319 --> 00:59:40,819
It tastes amazing.

1475
00:59:41,419 --> 00:59:43,229
(One bite)

1476
00:59:43,229 --> 00:59:46,060
(One big bite)

1477
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:49,200
It tastes so good.

1478
00:59:55,769 --> 00:59:56,769
Hey!

1479
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,839
(Empty)

1480
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:04,879
(What is with this guy?)

1481
01:00:07,419 --> 01:00:09,419
He looks so ugly.

1482
01:00:09,419 --> 01:00:12,019
He ate everything.

1483
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:16,629
After going into the water, instant noodles taste amazing.

1484
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:19,030
(Angry)

1485
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:22,300
- Give me some crab. - Okay.

1486
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:25,669
Kwang Soo peeled all the crayfish for me.

1487
01:00:25,769 --> 01:00:28,200
- He deserved the noodles. - He's feeding her.

1488
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:30,870
(Satisfied)

1489
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:31,939
It tastes so good.

1490
01:00:32,209 --> 01:00:35,410
It tastes a bit lighter.

1491
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,620
How can you be so good at peeling them?

1492
01:00:39,879 --> 01:00:42,189
You must have done it many times.

1493
01:00:42,189 --> 01:00:44,620
- Are you jealous? - You must have done it many times.

1494
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:47,390
You've done it for many girls, right?

1495
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:48,390
What are you talking about?

1496
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,189
It tastes so good.

1497
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,930
It shows.

1498
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,129
Can you fry the heads for us?

1499
01:00:56,129 --> 01:00:57,569
(He changes the subject.)

1500
01:00:57,569 --> 01:00:59,740
- They usually do that. - They do.

1501
01:01:00,669 --> 01:01:03,410
Did you know? Shrimps are the cockroaches of the sea.

1502
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:05,910
What do you mean?

1503
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:08,039
They're called so.

1504
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:09,879
Why?

1505
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:16,089
(They take pictures to celebrate the successful trip.)

1506
01:01:17,019 --> 01:01:20,890
(I-Go Project is over. We did it!)

1507
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:26,600
(They did some sightseeing on their own the next day.)

1508
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,899
(Tiger Moth Tour is over.)

1509
01:01:27,899 --> 01:01:30,330
- You had so much fun. - Right.

1510
01:01:31,569 --> 01:01:37,140
(This question will determine who will receive the live show penalty.)

1511
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:39,209
Kwang Soo looks like a celebrity.

1512
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,209
His face looks bigger than Darth Vader's.

1513
01:01:42,379 --> 01:01:45,209
- It's because I'm in the front. - Are you sure?

1514
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,120
I can't stop laughing.

1515
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,680
(The memories make them laugh.)

1516
01:01:49,149 --> 01:01:52,050
Was everything just a dream?

1517
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:53,589
A midsummer night's dream.

1518
01:01:53,689 --> 01:01:58,289
Whoever will be going to Australia...

1519
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:00,060
I feel sorry for you.

1520
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:02,629
It'll be harder than you imagine.

1521
01:02:03,499 --> 01:02:04,769
It's beyond your imagination.

1522
01:02:04,769 --> 01:02:06,640
- It was painful... - Really?

1523
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:09,140
- and exhausting. - But we're still alive.

1524
01:02:09,339 --> 01:02:13,039
We managed to buy some souvenirs for you.

1525
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,879
I bought what Seok Jin wanted too.

1526
01:02:15,109 --> 01:02:18,780
No, you didn't. I was watching you.

1527
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:19,780
Again?

1528
01:02:19,879 --> 01:02:21,249
Attention, guys.

1529
01:02:21,819 --> 01:02:23,350
Is it whether he bought my present or not?

1530
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:24,649
No way.

1531
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:27,260
I was with you the whole time. You didn't get it.

1532
01:02:27,689 --> 01:02:29,490
- He didn't get it. - On the last day,

1533
01:02:30,129 --> 01:02:31,629
I went with Chul Min.

1534
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,800
I couldn't buy one for everybody,

1535
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:36,729
but I got a small present.

1536
01:02:37,399 --> 01:02:39,300
No, he didn't. I'm sure.

1537
01:02:39,569 --> 01:02:40,700
Yesterday, I...

1538
01:02:41,399 --> 01:02:45,709
bought a present for sure.

1539
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:49,580
(Kwang Soo claims that he bought small presents for the members.)

1540
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,479
I assure you.

1541
01:02:51,649 --> 01:02:54,479
Kwang Soo never bought any presents.

1542
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:57,749
(So Min claims that he's lying and that he didn't buy anything.)

1543
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:00,189
I was so tired.

1544
01:03:00,189 --> 01:03:01,419
(Did Kwang Soo buy presents for the members?)

1545
01:03:01,419 --> 01:03:02,930
He mentioned it earlier.

1546
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:05,459
Kwang Soo claims that he bought the presents,

1547
01:03:05,459 --> 01:03:07,899
and So Min claims that he didn't.

1548
01:03:07,899 --> 01:03:09,330
- Kwang Soo? - For us?

1549
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:10,700
- Can it be for just one person? - I couldn't buy one for everybody.

1550
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:11,729
I couldn't.

1551
01:03:11,729 --> 01:03:14,240
It's something memorable. We didn't film the last day.

1552
01:03:14,899 --> 01:03:16,109
- We couldn't film it, - I see.

1553
01:03:16,109 --> 01:03:17,640
so we went out on our own.

1554
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,680
I bought a few memorable things.

1555
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,280
- He usually buys presents. - He does.

1556
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,649
Did the two of you go around together or separately?

1557
01:03:25,649 --> 01:03:26,780
We went around together.

1558
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:28,890
- All day? - Yes, we went around together.

1559
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:32,260
We ate with the camera crew.

1560
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:34,319
- We went out without the cameras. - We went...

1561
01:03:34,689 --> 01:03:37,959
If there were no cameras, he probably didn't buy it.

1562
01:03:38,729 --> 01:03:40,129
What do you mean?

1563
01:03:40,129 --> 01:03:42,330
- Someone has to be filming him? - Yes.

1564
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:44,629
(He likes to take credits for what he does.)

1565
01:03:44,629 --> 01:03:46,939
We went and when Kwang Soo came back to the hotel,

1566
01:03:46,939 --> 01:03:48,800
he only had a shopping bag.

1567
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,240
He only had chocolate wrappers...

1568
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:54,680
and trash. That was all he had in the white plastic bag.

1569
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:55,749
(So Min argues that Kwang Soo came back with a plastic bag.)

1570
01:03:56,749 --> 01:04:00,620
(He did go around downtown with a plastic bag.)

1571
01:04:01,319 --> 01:04:04,089
Didn't you talk about Seok Jin's present earlier?

1572
01:04:04,089 --> 01:04:06,760
He asked me for something over the phone.

1573
01:04:06,859 --> 01:04:08,459
Did I? I told you to get something, right?

1574
01:04:08,459 --> 01:04:09,890
- You mentioned it. - Right,

1575
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:12,030
- I remember. - He said it in the morning.

1576
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:13,760
He called me and told me to get something.

1577
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,530
I remember it clearly.

1578
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:17,229
- I told him to get fish jerky. - Fish jerky?

1579
01:04:17,229 --> 01:04:18,430
- Fish jerky. - Jerky?

1580
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:19,999
- You asked for the marinated ones. - The marinated ones...

1581
01:04:19,999 --> 01:04:22,039
- You didn't get it. - from Indonesia and Thailand.

1582
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:23,209
- The spicy ones? - Yes, the spicy ones.

1583
01:04:23,209 --> 01:04:25,039
- I know. - You know, right?

1584
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:26,180
- It's good. - We couldn't find them.

1585
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,839
- He didn't get it. - It's the red one.

1586
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:31,080
Hold on. If I didn't get it, why would I say that?

1587
01:04:31,979 --> 01:04:32,979
Why?

1588
01:04:33,979 --> 01:04:35,850
If he took his sunglasses off,

1589
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:37,620
we could have seen his eyes.

1590
01:04:38,019 --> 01:04:39,660
You won't be able to tell.

1591
01:04:39,859 --> 01:04:42,189
If we knew, we wouldn't be here.

1592
01:04:42,189 --> 01:04:43,189
(Come on, Se Chan.)

1593
01:04:43,189 --> 01:04:45,189
(That's true.)

1594
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,060
When did you get it?

1595
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,470
- When was it? - I walked...

1596
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:51,200
- You guys were together. - I walked from the restaurant...

1597
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,240
- to the coffee shop. - You were walking.

1598
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,870
- What did you buy on the way? - There were no coffee shops.

1599
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:57,669
Where? Where was it?

1600
01:04:57,910 --> 01:04:59,780
- Where was it? - They had it.

1601
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,539
On the way...

1602
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:03,249
Hold on.

1603
01:05:03,249 --> 01:05:07,180
Are they playing detectives?

1604
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:09,319
- It's called an interrogation. - An interrogation.

1605
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:11,390
That's what I meant.

1606
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:13,089
I knew I had to get it.

1607
01:05:13,089 --> 01:05:14,359
Was it a grocery store?

1608
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,390
- Hey, did you get it or not? - You didn't see him?

1609
01:05:18,459 --> 01:05:19,859
- You punk. - Look at this guy.

1610
01:05:19,859 --> 01:05:21,560
What are you doing?

1611
01:05:21,899 --> 01:05:23,629
This is annoying. Did you get it or not?

1612
01:05:23,629 --> 01:05:25,200
I got it. I got it, Jae Seok.

1613
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,269
- Did you? - Yes.

1614
01:05:26,399 --> 01:05:28,100
- He was busy taking pictures. - This is annoying. Did you get it?

1615
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,240
- There was a lot of construction. - Did you?

1616
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:32,979
Don't they look like a couple who defrauds people?

1617
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,240
If I didn't get it...

1618
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,850
(They are both tiger moths.)

1619
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:39,149
Did you use cash or credit card?

1620
01:05:39,419 --> 01:05:40,680
- I used cash. - What did you say?

1621
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:43,220
Stop lying. You brought a credit card with you.

1622
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:44,390
I paid cash.

1623
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:45,620
What did you say?

1624
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:46,890
(Why is he stuttering?)

1625
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:48,060
You didn't get a refund, right?

1626
01:05:48,959 --> 01:05:49,959
You didn't get a refund, right?

1627
01:05:50,189 --> 01:05:52,160
- When you play games, - A refund?

1628
01:05:52,359 --> 01:05:53,600
you need betting money.

1629
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,060
- Did you get money exchanged? - Isn't it an exchange?

1630
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:56,129
What did you say?

1631
01:05:56,129 --> 01:05:58,069
- My bad. - It's because of the Nevis Swing.

1632
01:05:58,269 --> 01:06:00,399
It's because of the Nevis Swing. Please understand.

1633
01:06:00,769 --> 01:06:04,169
(This is how much he's scared of it.)

1634
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:05,910
Please make your final decisions.

1635
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:07,209
He might not have gotten the presents,

1636
01:06:07,209 --> 01:06:08,680
but Seok Jin asked for it.

1637
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,910
So Min knows that...

1638
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:11,209
- I got it for sure. - There was nowhere to buy it.

1639
01:06:11,209 --> 01:06:13,919
- Did you get it yet? - No, I didn't.

1640
01:06:13,919 --> 01:06:15,689
It's whether he got the present or not.

1641
01:06:15,689 --> 01:06:17,620
This is your final decision. In one...

1642
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:19,160
- No way. - She saw me getting it.

1643
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,589
- Two, - No, I didn't.

1644
01:06:20,959 --> 01:06:22,019
three.

1645
01:06:22,689 --> 01:06:26,560
(Kwang Soo named what he got, so he sounds trustworthy.)

1646
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:32,069
(So Min had a picture to prove her point.)

1647
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:34,569
(Se Chan has the most penalty badges.)

1648
01:06:34,569 --> 01:06:37,370
(Jong Kook and So Min are closely after him.)

1649
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:44,510
(This question decides what they'll be doing on the holiday.)

1650
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:47,979
In 1, 2, 3.

1651
01:06:47,979 --> 01:06:49,149
(Which of the tiger moths will they trust?)

1652
01:06:49,149 --> 01:06:50,620
- I want to trust him. - I trust Kwang Soo.

1653
01:06:51,189 --> 01:06:52,760
- I pick Kwang Soo. - I trust him.

1654
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,620
(3 pick Kwang Soo, and 3 others pick So Min.)

1655
01:06:54,959 --> 01:06:56,289
(They are tied 3 to 3.)

1656
01:06:56,289 --> 01:06:57,830
All day...

1657
01:06:58,229 --> 01:07:00,629
I didn't trust him all day and now I do.

1658
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,330
The thing is...

1659
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:03,600
- It might not be something big, - I think he got it.

1660
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,270
but he usually gets little things.

1661
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,739
He usually doesn't get money exchanged.

1662
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:10,039
He could have borrowed it.

1663
01:07:10,869 --> 01:07:13,909
So Kwang Soo gets a penalty badge.

1664
01:07:13,909 --> 01:07:16,350
(Kwang Soo gets another penalty badge.)

1665
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:17,449
- Right. - It's 3 on 3.

1666
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:19,820
There might be a twist to this story.

1667
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:21,350
(If they tie, Kwang Soo gets a penalty badge.)

1668
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:22,690
- Hold on. - We are safe now.

1669
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:23,919
So Min and I are safe now.

1670
01:07:23,919 --> 01:07:25,560
I lost this?

1671
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,190
He ate it all. He bought and ate...

1672
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:29,829
- all the snacks and chocolate. - Okay.

1673
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:31,190
He ate it all.

1674
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:32,360
(Their fates depend on who's telling the truth.)

1675
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,999
The person...

1676
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:36,970
who's lying will stand up...

1677
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:39,100
- on my count of three. - The person who lied?

1678
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:40,869
The person who lied?

1679
01:07:40,869 --> 01:07:43,039
- That person will stand up. - Okay.

1680
01:07:43,209 --> 01:07:44,739
- 1, - 1,

1681
01:07:44,739 --> 01:07:45,779
- 2... - 2...

1682
01:07:45,779 --> 01:07:47,739
(Se Chan, Seok Jin, and Jae Seok think he got the present.)

1683
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:49,180
- 2, 3. - 2, 3.

1684
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:50,449
(Jong Kook, Haha, and Ji Hyo believe So Min.)

1685
01:07:50,449 --> 01:07:52,220
(They think Kwang Soo didn't get the present.)

1686
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:55,989
(Who's lying here?)

1687
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:59,520
(Kwang Soo is lying.)

1688
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,989
How can you lie to me about my present?

1689
01:08:00,989 --> 01:08:02,390
Are you human?

1690
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:04,260
Are you human?

1691
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:05,289
Sorry.

1692
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:06,560
I said he didn't get it.

1693
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,659
Why would I get presents when I went there for a penalty?

1694
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:10,869
You should have said you didn't get it.

1695
01:08:10,869 --> 01:08:12,199
Why did you lie?

1696
01:08:12,699 --> 01:08:14,499
- Well... - What if I...

1697
01:08:14,539 --> 01:08:16,369
You know I didn't get once right?

1698
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:18,169
I changed my mind at the end.

1699
01:08:18,169 --> 01:08:19,640
- You wanted me to trust you? - I'm sorry.

1700
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,640
How can I trust you?

1701
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:22,709
I'm sorry.

1702
01:08:22,709 --> 01:08:24,110
I think I know now.

1703
01:08:24,209 --> 01:08:25,350
Good job, So Min.

1704
01:08:25,879 --> 01:08:27,480
It depends on Se Chan's decision.

1705
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:31,050
(The Tiger Moth Tour finally came to an end.)

1706
01:08:31,589 --> 01:08:33,989
All right. I'll tell you the final scores.

1707
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:36,489
Se Chan has four penalty badges.

1708
01:08:36,489 --> 01:08:37,860
I didn't even get one right.

1709
01:08:38,029 --> 01:08:39,959
- How's that possible? - You're incredible.

1710
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,699
He must be a shaman.

1711
01:08:41,959 --> 01:08:43,529
What is he saying?

1712
01:08:43,529 --> 01:08:44,930
(This is all because of you.)

1713
01:08:45,369 --> 01:08:47,400
So Min, Kwang Soo,

1714
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:48,699
Jong Kook, Jae Seok,

1715
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:50,440
and Seok Jin have two each.

1716
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:54,209
For me, it's a big accomplishment to get half right,

1717
01:08:54,209 --> 01:08:56,279
but I can't believe I'm in crisis again.

1718
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,320
(You should have trusted me.)

1719
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,379
Ji Hyo and Haha...

1720
01:09:01,379 --> 01:09:03,119
are exempt from the penalty.

1721
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:05,249
Enjoy your holidays.

1722
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,659
I'll watch you guys on TV.

1723
01:09:06,659 --> 01:09:08,289
I'll watch you on TV.

1724
01:09:08,289 --> 01:09:10,760
Nevis Swing.

1725
01:09:12,329 --> 01:09:13,360
(It makes him tear up.)

1726
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,699
Nevis Swing.

1727
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:16,699
I'd rather work on a holiday.

1728
01:09:17,329 --> 01:09:18,869
Now,

1729
01:09:19,669 --> 01:09:21,640
- Se Chan... - Does he get to choose?

1730
01:09:21,999 --> 01:09:23,539
will choose one person.

1731
01:09:23,610 --> 01:09:26,839
I'll introduce the live broadcast you'll be doing on Chuseok.

1732
01:09:26,839 --> 01:09:28,039
- What is it? - What is it?

1733
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:30,350
It's a water bomb penalty with the citizens.

1734
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:31,909
What did you say? Water bomb?

1735
01:09:31,909 --> 01:09:33,119
(It's a water bomb penalty with the citizens.)

1736
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:36,489
(Se Chan and another member will complete a mission.)

1737
01:09:36,489 --> 01:09:40,390
(The loser gets the water bomb.)

1738
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:42,060
Depending on the viewer's pick,

1739
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:44,760
one of you will be exempted and the other will get the water bomb.

1740
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:45,760
It'll be live.

1741
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:48,060
I'm fine with the water bomb,

1742
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:49,669
but we have to go all the way there.

1743
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:52,800
We have to leave early from home.

1744
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:53,839
Right.

1745
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:57,010
Cars make an endless line.

1746
01:09:57,770 --> 01:10:00,510
Highways around the country had traffic from the morning.

1747
01:10:00,539 --> 01:10:02,350
The congestion has been the worst.

1748
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:03,350
(They must fight the traffic and get to the rest stop first.)

1749
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:06,919
Se Chan is in last place.

1750
01:10:07,249 --> 01:10:08,720
This is so tiring.

1751
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:10,320
I'm so tired.

1752
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,720
To be honest, Se Chan.

1753
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:14,289
I'm not lying about this.

1754
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:17,190
I have to go on a trip from the 5th or the 6th.

1755
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:21,129
- It's from the 5th to the 12th. - So what?

1756
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,970
- That's what I mean. - So what?

1757
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:25,100
What am I supposed to do about that?

1758
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:27,039
Are you asking me...

1759
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:29,140
- to refund your flight? - He can go another time.

1760
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:30,270
What am I supposed to do?

1761
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:32,440
That's what I was thinking. What are you supposed to do?

1762
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:34,180
It's until the 12th.

1763
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,909
Just keep it in mind.

1764
01:10:35,909 --> 01:10:36,949
(I'm away until the 12th, just to let you know.)

1765
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:38,350
Let me say this one thing.

1766
01:10:38,779 --> 01:10:40,180
If you skip me,

1767
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,119
I'll skip you too.

1768
01:10:43,789 --> 01:10:46,119
That doesn't bother me at all.

1769
01:10:46,119 --> 01:10:48,220
I already have the Nevis Swing, so what would I skip?

1770
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,390
I have nothing to back off from.

1771
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:51,730
I'm just going forward.

1772
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:54,129
He has to go to Oceania anyways.

1773
01:10:54,129 --> 01:10:56,430
- I have to go. - You might provoke him even more.

1774
01:10:56,430 --> 01:10:57,829
Why are you provoking me?

1775
01:10:57,829 --> 01:10:59,300
I was just saying.

1776
01:10:59,539 --> 01:11:00,999
What do you want me to do?

1777
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:03,409
This is a coincidence,

1778
01:11:03,539 --> 01:11:05,610
but candidates for the penalty are sitting on one side,

1779
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:06,839
and you two are sitting on the other side.

1780
01:11:06,839 --> 01:11:07,909
You're my sister from Mapo-gu.

1781
01:11:07,909 --> 01:11:08,909
I feel at ease.

1782
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:12,180
Se Chan, stand behind...

1783
01:11:12,279 --> 01:11:14,379
and rip the name tag of the person you want to go with.

1784
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:16,190
On October 18,

1785
01:11:17,449 --> 01:11:19,119
you two will go ahead with the penalty.

1786
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:21,989
Ask who wants to volunteer.

1787
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:24,659
Who wants to come with me?

1788
01:11:26,329 --> 01:11:27,900
Who wants to come with me?

1789
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,970
(They're silent.)

1790
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:35,770
- Goodness. - Look at all of you.

1791
01:11:36,409 --> 01:11:38,640
I see. Hold on.

1792
01:11:38,709 --> 01:11:40,279
- Hold on. - Wherever it may be.

1793
01:11:40,279 --> 01:11:42,249
- I'll go. - I was going to pass that person.

1794
01:11:42,409 --> 01:11:44,680
- I guess none of you want to come. - Where ever it may be.

1795
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:46,180
I want to join you.

1796
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:47,419
- By the way, - This is a mental game.

1797
01:11:47,419 --> 01:11:49,789
- I don't like what he's saying. - He's on my team.

1798
01:11:49,789 --> 01:11:50,820
He's on the Nevis team.

1799
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:51,989
You have to think about this too.

1800
01:11:51,989 --> 01:11:56,029
Who do you think the viewers would like to see?

1801
01:11:57,029 --> 01:11:58,360
That's right.

1802
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,129
He's a present to them.

1803
01:12:00,129 --> 01:12:02,129
He's a present himself.

1804
01:12:02,129 --> 01:12:04,169
Who do you think is the best in Running Man?

1805
01:12:05,999 --> 01:12:07,400
He's really a present.

1806
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,369
- People will be so happy. - What are holidays for?

1807
01:12:09,369 --> 01:12:11,239
Who do you think can make people happy?

1808
01:12:11,239 --> 01:12:13,980
I'll exclude two people.

1809
01:12:15,079 --> 01:12:19,579
I'll exclude the Indonesian team.

1810
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:21,879
- Thank you. - Why would you exclude them?

1811
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:23,489
- Why would you do that? - I watched the video,

1812
01:12:23,489 --> 01:12:25,690
and they worked too hard. You know.

1813
01:12:25,789 --> 01:12:27,520
You have to admit that it was tough for them.

1814
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:28,890
- Run towards me. - Yes.

1815
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:32,129
Gosh.

1816
01:12:32,129 --> 01:12:34,400
(We'll watch the live broadcast at home.)

1817
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:37,800
Please count down so that he can choose.

1818
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,199
This is something good.

1819
01:12:40,199 --> 01:12:42,100
- Of course. - Please smile for me.

1820
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:43,810
- From the sixth. - Show me your beautiful smiles.

1821
01:12:43,810 --> 01:12:45,409
We know how to smile.

1822
01:12:45,409 --> 01:12:47,209
I have a nice smile.

1823
01:12:47,209 --> 01:12:49,110
- Show me your beautiful smiles. - From the 6th to the 12th...

1824
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:50,480
I get it. So what?

1825
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,279
Why are you telling me that?

1826
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:53,980
I'm Smile Kim.

1827
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:55,419
Five.

1828
01:12:55,419 --> 01:12:56,949
- No way. - It's coming.

1829
01:12:56,949 --> 01:12:58,289
- Three, - Jae Seok.

1830
01:12:58,289 --> 01:12:59,890
two...

1831
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:01,589
Make up your mind.

1832
01:13:01,959 --> 01:13:04,589
What is Se Chan's decision?

1833
01:13:04,989 --> 01:13:06,400
- Hurry up. - Everybody,

1834
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,629
who would you like to see?

1835
01:13:07,629 --> 01:13:10,129
- Se Chan. - Who is it?

1836
01:13:10,369 --> 01:13:13,300
Is it Jong Kook or Seok Jin?

1837
01:13:13,869 --> 01:13:15,770
It's...

1838
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:20,510
(Is it Jong Kook?)

1839
01:13:20,510 --> 01:13:23,680
(Is it Seok Jin who has a trip planned?)

1840
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:28,480
(Is it Jae Seok who's the best emcee out there?)

1841
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,589
Jae Seok.

1842
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:30,850
It's Jae Seok.

1843
01:13:30,850 --> 01:13:35,260
(Jae Seok will be joining him for the live broadcast.)

1844
01:13:36,289 --> 01:13:39,699
(Se Chan and Jae Seok will be broadcasting on Chuseok.)

1845
01:13:39,699 --> 01:13:41,529
Everybody wanted to see him, right?

1846
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:45,770
(We'll be watching from home as well.)

1847
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:48,869
It's Korea's best emcee, Yu Jae Seok.

1848
01:13:49,169 --> 01:13:50,510
We'll see you at the rest stop.

1849
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:53,940
Good job, Se Chan.

1850
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:55,749
- I listened to Jong Kook. - It's a present.

1851
01:13:55,749 --> 01:13:57,480
It's a present for the people.

1852
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,520
- That's right. - Jong Kook was convincing.

1853
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,190
I was convincing.

1854
01:14:02,190 --> 01:14:05,089
People will be so happy. They'll be so thankful.

1855
01:14:05,089 --> 01:14:06,320
Good job, Se Chan.

1856
01:14:06,489 --> 01:14:08,520
Bring your car, and pick me up.

1857
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,029
Of course. I'll pick you up.

1858
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:12,230
All right.

1859
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:13,999
(He tries to calm down.)

1860
01:14:13,999 --> 01:14:15,400
- On the 8th... - Are you all right?

1861
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,869
(Are you all right?)

1862
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,400
- Are you all right? - He's not happy.

1863
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,600
- Jae Seok. - Please smile, Jae Seok.

1864
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,140
- Please. - He's not happy.

1865
01:14:22,339 --> 01:14:23,970
You should spend some time with him.

1866
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:25,310
- I will. - Sure.

1867
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:28,480
After this, the live broadcast will continue.

1868
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,680
- We'll follow it. - Please smile.

1869
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:32,079
"At the scene..."

1870
01:14:32,079 --> 01:14:33,150
(That's what they say on live broadcasts.)

1871
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:35,079
You and I...

1872
01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:36,749
Reporter Yu Jae Seok.

1873
01:14:36,789 --> 01:14:39,589
You can call yourself.

1874
01:14:39,589 --> 01:14:41,320
Let's get to the scene.

1875
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:42,760
I'll be there.

1876
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:45,129
(Yes, I'll be there.)

1877
01:14:45,129 --> 01:14:47,499
(As the top emcee, he starts the broadcast right away.)

1878
01:14:47,499 --> 01:14:48,869
Yes, I'll be there.

1879
01:14:48,869 --> 01:14:50,999
Let's get it. Okay.

1880
01:14:50,999 --> 01:14:51,999
I'll be there.

1881
01:14:51,999 --> 01:14:54,999
(Jae Seok and Se Chan's Chuseok live broadcast starts now.)

1882
01:15:02,579 --> 01:15:06,480
(Deokpyeong Rest Stop, Icheon)

1883
01:15:18,230 --> 01:15:19,230
(Yu Jae Seok, Yang Se Chan)

1884
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:21,499
- Hello. Nice to meet you. - Hello.

1885
01:15:21,499 --> 01:15:22,800
Hello, I'm Yang Se Chan.

1886
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:24,199
Nice to meet you.

1887
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:26,699
Finally,

1888
01:15:26,699 --> 01:15:29,539
- as you see, it's Chuseok. - You're right.

1889
01:15:29,539 --> 01:15:31,310
There's not much of it left,

1890
01:15:31,310 --> 01:15:33,709
but Se Chan and I...

1891
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:36,850
- are here with many guests. - That's right.

1892
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:39,650
We're doing a live broadcast at the rest stop.

1893
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,279
It's a penalty.

1894
01:15:41,279 --> 01:15:43,320
That's right. Today finally came.

1895
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,249
- Of course. - I didn't think it would come.

1896
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:47,119
I thought about this.

1897
01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:50,959
Do we have to do the penalty on live broadcast?

1898
01:15:51,159 --> 01:15:53,329
Anyway, I'm here now.

1899
01:15:53,329 --> 01:15:56,070
We're here, and so many people are cheering for us.

1900
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:57,970
- Isn't it great? - I'm so happy...

1901
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:00,699
- that they are welcoming us. - So many people are here.

1902
01:16:00,699 --> 01:16:01,699
I'm so happy.

1903
01:16:01,699 --> 01:16:03,369
Did you enjoy the Chuseok holidays?

1904
01:16:03,369 --> 01:16:05,909
Se Hyung and I went to Dongducheon.

1905
01:16:05,909 --> 01:16:08,980
- I guess you met your friends. - Yes, we had many meatballs.

1906
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:13,220
I heard Se Hyung was catching up with his friends...

1907
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:15,589
and woke up at 5pm the next day.

1908
01:16:15,589 --> 01:16:16,919
Yes, he got a hangover.

1909
01:16:17,089 --> 01:16:18,989
- He's still bedridden. - I see.

1910
01:16:18,989 --> 01:16:23,459
Anyhow, Se Chan and I are at this rest stop...

1911
01:16:23,459 --> 01:16:26,860
doing a live broadcast. We have around 14 minutes left.

1912
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:28,900
- Time flies. - I hope that...

1913
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:31,369
we finish off nicely without making any mistakes.

1914
01:16:31,369 --> 01:16:32,699
- We'll get the penalty... - That's right.

1915
01:16:32,699 --> 01:16:35,039
and return home.

1916
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:37,539
We still have tomorrow left of the holidays,

1917
01:16:37,539 --> 01:16:40,779
so please join Running Man during your long weekend.

1918
01:16:40,779 --> 01:16:42,480
I hope that you enjoy the rest of it.

1919
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,310
Can you explain the rules to us?

1920
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:47,150
- Should I explain it? - Should I?

1921
01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:48,680
- Yes. - I'll do it.

1922
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,350
You're good at this.

1923
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:52,690
I'll say it then. It's simple.

1924
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:54,989
Today, we came here early...

1925
01:16:55,089 --> 01:16:58,629
and recruited three people per team.

1926
01:16:58,690 --> 01:17:00,430
We divided them up into Team Jae Seok and Team Se Chan.

1927
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:03,629
We'll play three rounds.

1928
01:17:03,699 --> 01:17:05,539
There are four rounds in total.

1929
01:17:05,539 --> 01:17:09,110
We'll play four rounds. You see the roulette there?

1930
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:12,110
- Yes, I do. - Whenever you lose,

1931
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:14,039
- The name tags. - we'll put our names on it.

1932
01:17:14,039 --> 01:17:16,779
We'll spin the roulette at the end,

1933
01:17:17,379 --> 01:17:19,579
and if it stops on my name, I'll take the water bomb.

1934
01:17:19,779 --> 01:17:23,320
If it stops on your name, you'll get the water bomb.

1935
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,690
If it lands on both of us, we'll both get it.

1936
01:17:25,690 --> 01:17:27,989
We'll both get the water bomb.

1937
01:17:27,989 --> 01:17:30,489
This is live, so we can't fake it.

1938
01:17:30,489 --> 01:17:32,159
We have to speak quickly...

1939
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,100
because we have to finish in 15 minutes.

1940
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:35,600
We have 13 minutes left.

1941
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,770
We'll get started with the games for the live broadcast.

1942
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:42,610
- Let's go. - Let's get started with round one.

1943
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:45,779
The first game...

1944
01:17:45,810 --> 01:17:48,209
is something our viewers would have wanted to try.

1945
01:17:48,209 --> 01:17:49,879
- Many people would have. - It's Pirate Roulette.

1946
01:17:49,879 --> 01:17:51,409
Here it is.

1947
01:17:51,409 --> 01:17:53,879
Kwang Soo, Seok Jin,

1948
01:17:53,879 --> 01:17:55,850
- and I... You are one of us too. - Kind of.

1949
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:58,220
- We are unlucky. - You are unlucky.

1950
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:01,159
Our producer is rushing us.

1951
01:18:01,159 --> 01:18:03,659
Why did you set up a live broadcast then?

1952
01:18:03,789 --> 01:18:06,100
- You should have filmed it. - Let's get to the point.

1953
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:08,060
- All right. - Shall we play?

1954
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:09,529
He wants to get to the point.

1955
01:18:09,529 --> 01:18:11,900
Once I start talking, I can't stop.

1956
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,100
Please interrupt me.

1957
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:15,510
Here's round one. The game is,

1958
01:18:15,510 --> 01:18:17,369
as I have mentioned, it's Pirate Roulette.

1959
01:18:17,369 --> 01:18:19,940
Let me take one person from each team.

1960
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:22,079
- Please come up. - It's Mr. Jung Bong Jun...

1961
01:18:22,079 --> 01:18:24,209
and Mr. Um Ki Young.

1962
01:18:24,209 --> 01:18:25,619
- Please come up. - Let's welcome them.

1963
01:18:25,619 --> 01:18:26,619
Please.

1964
01:18:26,949 --> 01:18:28,779
Nice to meet you. Hello.

1965
01:18:28,779 --> 01:18:29,989
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1966
01:18:30,119 --> 01:18:33,060
Let's conduct a short interview.

1967
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:35,690
Did you have a good holiday?

1968
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:37,060
Where are you coming back from?

1969
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:38,459
I went to Jecheon.

1970
01:18:38,489 --> 01:18:39,959
What were you doing there?

1971
01:18:39,959 --> 01:18:41,400
I went with my friends.

1972
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:43,529
This is live, so you must be nervous.

1973
01:18:43,529 --> 01:18:45,100
Yes, a little bit.

1974
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:48,970
You're joining us for the penalty today.

1975
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:50,869
You'll be playing this game. How are you usually?

1976
01:18:50,869 --> 01:18:55,110
Are you lucky or unlucky like us?

1977
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:56,150
I'm unlucky.

1978
01:18:56,850 --> 01:18:58,680
You chose the wrong person.

1979
01:18:58,779 --> 01:19:00,480
- I have to win. - Let me ask.

1980
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,879
- Please introduce yourself. - How about you, Ki Young?

1981
01:19:02,079 --> 01:19:04,289
I'm Um Ki Young from Suwon. I'm 37 years old.

1982
01:19:04,289 --> 01:19:06,159
Do you usually get lucky?

1983
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:07,360
I get really lucky.

1984
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,589
- Really? - Where are you returning from?

1985
01:19:09,589 --> 01:19:11,789
- I was in Daegu. - I see.

1986
01:19:12,329 --> 01:19:14,360
- So you are lucky, right? - Yes.

1987
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:16,400
- All right. - We would love to...

1988
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,800
conduct longer interviews.

1989
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:22,369
- But we have no time. - We have no time,

1990
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:26,510
so we'll get started with round one right away.

1991
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:29,279
You're unlucky like me,

1992
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:31,150
- but I trust you this time. - Let's get it.

1993
01:19:31,150 --> 01:19:33,850
- Please come forward, Bong Jun. - Please come forward, Ki Young.

1994
01:19:34,119 --> 01:19:36,690
Please do rock-paper-scissors.

1995
01:19:36,690 --> 01:19:38,419
- The winner... - The winner will go first.

1996
01:19:38,789 --> 01:19:40,619
You can choose.

1997
01:19:40,619 --> 01:19:41,690
Please do rock-paper-scissors.

1998
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:43,060
Rock-paper-scissors

1999
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:44,430
- He won. - You won.

2000
01:19:44,430 --> 01:19:45,459
He can go first.

2001
01:19:45,459 --> 01:19:46,459
Good job.

2002
01:19:46,499 --> 01:19:48,199
It won't pop up from the beginning, right?

2003
01:19:48,199 --> 01:19:49,230
That'll be fun.

2004
01:19:49,869 --> 01:19:51,600
Okay... What?

2005
01:19:51,869 --> 01:19:53,800
Everybody.

2006
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,709
(Team Se Chan wins.)

2007
01:19:55,709 --> 01:19:57,610
Everybody, this is live broadcast.

2008
01:19:57,610 --> 01:19:59,010
This wasn't made up.

2009
01:19:59,310 --> 01:20:01,680
Bong Jun, you are so unlucky.

2010
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:03,350
You're so unlucky.

2011
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:05,680
- Ki Young didn't even do anything. - I know...

2012
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,480
I'm unlucky but not this much.

2013
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,449
You're Kwang Soo's level.

2014
01:20:09,949 --> 01:20:12,890
- I just got goosebumps. - Me too.

2015
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:15,320
Ki Young didn't even go.

2016
01:20:15,489 --> 01:20:16,589
Round one is over.

2017
01:20:16,589 --> 01:20:18,860
That was too short.

2018
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:20,029
You're in disbelief.

2019
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:22,230
How do you feel?

2020
01:20:22,499 --> 01:20:23,499
I'm happy.

2021
01:20:24,129 --> 01:20:25,169
You're happy?

2022
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,169
- Really? - I'm so unhappy right now.

2023
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,869
- How can you do that in 1 try? - He lost in 1 try.

2024
01:20:29,869 --> 01:20:32,239
- So round one, - I won.

2025
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:35,379
I lost. Thank you, Bong Jun and Ki Young.

2026
01:20:35,379 --> 01:20:37,180
- Thank you. - Thank you. Please have a seat.

2027
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:39,020
I'll stick on your name tag.

2028
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:40,480
I'm so...

2029
01:20:40,879 --> 01:20:41,879
Thank you.

2030
01:20:42,890 --> 01:20:44,350
During the holidays...

2031
01:20:45,589 --> 01:20:46,860
You're supposed to stick mine up.

2032
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:48,959
- That was close. - This is live,

2033
01:20:48,959 --> 01:20:50,659
so it's...

2034
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:52,900
a small glitch.

2035
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:54,499
You can put it anywhere.

2036
01:20:55,999 --> 01:20:56,999
Sure.

2037
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,900
I was so flustered...

2038
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:02,470
on live television.

2039
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:05,709
As soon as Bong Jun said that he's unlucky...

2040
01:21:05,709 --> 01:21:07,539
- As soon as he said it. - As soon as he played,

2041
01:21:07,579 --> 01:21:09,310
- the pirate popped up. - Right.

2042
01:21:09,310 --> 01:21:11,279
This could have been made up.

2043
01:21:11,279 --> 01:21:13,220
I was so flustered that I almost stuck my name up.

2044
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:15,749
Bong Jun had no idea.

2045
01:21:15,749 --> 01:21:18,350
I find something else really strange.

2046
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:20,390
Bong Jun looks too happy.

2047
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:21,390
He looks so composed.

2048
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:22,989
He thinks he did something grand.

2049
01:21:22,989 --> 01:21:25,430
He forgot that he's on my team.

2050
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:27,329
Ki Young didn't do anything. I feel bad for him.

2051
01:21:27,329 --> 01:21:29,499
That's right. He only introduced himself.

2052
01:21:29,529 --> 01:21:32,199
He merely said he's from Suwon.

2053
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:33,869
He didn't do anything, and he's back in his seat.

2054
01:21:33,869 --> 01:21:35,709
- Thank you, Ki Young. - Thank you.

2055
01:21:35,709 --> 01:21:38,470
Let's get started with round two.

2056
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:42,879
This is live so we must hurry. Please understand.

2057
01:21:42,879 --> 01:21:45,879
Round two is another roulette game we played a lot.

2058
01:21:45,879 --> 01:21:47,079
We did.

2059
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:48,949
- It's Water Gun Roulette. - Let's go.

2060
01:21:48,949 --> 01:21:50,150
Let's invite our guests.

2061
01:21:50,150 --> 01:21:53,190
It's Ms. Kim Min Soo and Mr. Cho Seung Hoon.

2062
01:21:53,190 --> 01:21:54,860
- Hello. - Hello.

2063
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:56,629
- I'm... - Sorry?

2064
01:21:56,629 --> 01:21:58,999
I'm Kim Min Soo, and I'm a mom with two kids.

2065
01:21:58,999 --> 01:22:01,360
- She's Kim Min Soo. - Please introduce yourself.

2066
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,699
I'm Cho Seung Hoon from Suwon. I'm 33 years old.

2067
01:22:03,699 --> 01:22:04,999
He's Seung Hoon.

2068
01:22:04,999 --> 01:22:06,839
I heard that...

2069
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:08,600
you are a married couple.

2070
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:09,640
- Is that right? - Yes.

2071
01:22:09,770 --> 01:22:12,110
One of you are on my team, and the other is on Se Chan's team.

2072
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:14,010
- You're separated. Is that okay? - It's okay.

2073
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:16,110
- Is it okay? - Yes, it is.

2074
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:17,879
Are you okay too, Min Soo?

2075
01:22:17,879 --> 01:22:19,449
- Yes, I am. - I see.

2076
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:22,650
We separated the team. I'm sure you saw earlier.

2077
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:24,520
During the first round,

2078
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,560
our team lost.

2079
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,390
We need for you to win.

2080
01:22:29,390 --> 01:22:30,430
Okay.

2081
01:22:30,430 --> 01:22:32,629
Are you good with games? Are you usually lucky?

2082
01:22:33,029 --> 01:22:34,159
Yes, I am.

2083
01:22:34,499 --> 01:22:36,369
- That's great. What about you? - I'm relieved.

2084
01:22:36,369 --> 01:22:38,430
- I'm usually unlucky. - He...

2085
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:39,940
- Are you really? - He has bad luck.

2086
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:41,140
Thank goodness.

2087
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:43,940
We need to win this time...

2088
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:45,310
for the game...

2089
01:22:45,310 --> 01:22:46,610
- to become neck and neck. - That's right.

2090
01:22:46,610 --> 01:22:48,779
How has your Chuseok holiday been so far?

2091
01:22:49,079 --> 01:22:51,249
My family... Our family...

2092
01:22:51,249 --> 01:22:52,449
went on a trip.

2093
01:22:52,449 --> 01:22:53,680
- A trip? - Where did you go?

2094
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,489
- The east coast. - That's so nice.

2095
01:22:55,619 --> 01:22:57,289
How was the trip?

2096
01:22:57,390 --> 01:22:58,520
- It was fun. - Was it?

2097
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,690
Were you driving the whole time?

2098
01:22:59,690 --> 01:23:01,390
No, my wife...

2099
01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:03,560
took turns with me. It was a relaxing trip.

2100
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:06,600
Were there any funny happenings on the trip?

2101
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:10,029
It was my first time seeing the sunrise.

2102
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:11,629
It was very meaningful for me.

2103
01:23:11,629 --> 01:23:12,800
- Wish. - When you saw it,

2104
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,640
- did you make a wish? - Yes.

2105
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:15,709
What did you wish for?

2106
01:23:15,839 --> 01:23:17,239
For my family to have luck.

2107
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:19,079
- What about you? - What about you?

2108
01:23:19,079 --> 01:23:21,579
- I was sleeping then. - You were sleeping.

2109
01:23:22,949 --> 01:23:24,209
Did you only sleep?

2110
01:23:24,209 --> 01:23:25,749
- I slept in. - You shouldn't say that.

2111
01:23:26,379 --> 01:23:27,850
This can't be aired.

2112
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:29,190
She just told me something.

2113
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:31,489
Did she say something? Is she mad about him sleeping?

2114
01:23:31,489 --> 01:23:33,520
- I can't say it since we're live. - You can't.

2115
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,360
I would say it if we're recording since we can edit it out.

2116
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,089
However, I can't say this. She was so mad...

2117
01:23:38,089 --> 01:23:40,300
- that she told me something. - She was mad.

2118
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:42,770
I'll tell you what she said after the live show finishes.

2119
01:23:42,829 --> 01:23:44,770
Do you have any idea what she might have said?

2120
01:23:44,970 --> 01:23:46,999
- I'm not sure. - No?

2121
01:23:46,999 --> 01:23:48,909
- You'll be shocked. - Shocked?

2122
01:23:48,909 --> 01:23:52,010
Since we're live, we'll hurry and move on.

2123
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:54,339
- Water gun. - If you keep rolling that,

2124
01:23:54,339 --> 01:23:56,050
you might accidentally roll forward...

2125
01:23:56,050 --> 01:23:58,980
since it's their first live show. Please be very careful.

2126
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:00,650
Anyway...

2127
01:24:00,650 --> 01:24:02,690
Anyway, the live show continues.

2128
01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:04,720
First round of penalties.

2129
01:24:05,489 --> 01:24:06,619
They're a married couple.

2130
01:24:06,890 --> 01:24:09,060
One water gun has water in it...

2131
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:10,890
- while the other doesn't. - No.

2132
01:24:10,989 --> 01:24:13,060
You must choose 1 on the count of 3,

2133
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:15,800
then shoot toward your opponent.

2134
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:16,829
Toward the face.

2135
01:24:16,829 --> 01:24:18,940
- Will that be all right? - Yes, it's fine.

2136
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:20,499
- Are you okay with it? - Yes, I'm fine.

2137
01:24:20,499 --> 01:24:22,669
- Great. - They're so into it that...

2138
01:24:22,770 --> 01:24:24,839
- we question their marriage. - You're right.

2139
01:24:24,839 --> 01:24:26,440
- They're so focused. - They're focused.

2140
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:28,510
- Okay, move up. - Please move up.

2141
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:30,779
We'll now start the Water Gun Roulette.

2142
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:33,180
You can choose the one you want.

2143
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:34,779
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2144
01:24:34,779 --> 01:24:36,289
Rock-paper-scissors

2145
01:24:36,289 --> 01:24:37,650
Okay, Seung Hoon.

2146
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:39,489
Are you sure it's that one?

2147
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:40,789
Okay.

2148
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:42,159
Min Soo.

2149
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:44,089
Please be careful with what you mouth.

2150
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:46,360
- All right. - Min Soo.

2151
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,800
Point it towards your opponent.

2152
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,230
- Don't shoot it yet. - Not yet.

2153
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:51,300
- Now... - Aim it towards the face.

2154
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,600
- Towards the face. - Yes.

2155
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,169
One. Towards the face.

2156
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,739
1, 2, 3. Shoot.

2157
01:24:56,739 --> 01:24:58,980
Okay! Hold on.

2158
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:00,839
- Stop. - Stop shooting.

2159
01:25:00,839 --> 01:25:02,680
- She's really mad. - She's your wife.

2160
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:03,779
Are you all right?

2161
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:06,419
She's so mad.

2162
01:25:06,779 --> 01:25:08,079
We lost again.

2163
01:25:08,079 --> 01:25:09,989
- In the middle... - I'm going crazy.

2164
01:25:10,089 --> 01:25:11,320
I thought you were lucky.

2165
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,860
I guess I'm not.

2166
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:14,690
What I'm worried about...

2167
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:17,089
- is that they'd fight. - They might fight.

2168
01:25:17,089 --> 01:25:18,360
You shouldn't do that.

2169
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:20,860
Are you all right? There's a lot of water. Sorry.

2170
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:23,669
- With that, Se Chan won again. - This round too.

2171
01:25:23,669 --> 01:25:25,470
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

2172
01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:27,539
Min Soo, are you okay? We don't have any towels.

2173
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:29,310
It's my name again.

2174
01:25:30,270 --> 01:25:32,480
Why are we doing this?

2175
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,980
It's just my name on the roulette.

2176
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:36,650
We only have about five minutes

2177
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:38,949
- You have to stick it on faster. - All right.

2178
01:25:38,949 --> 01:25:40,150
Se Chan.

2179
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:42,650
We have to proceed to the third round...

2180
01:25:42,650 --> 01:25:45,320
- within 2 minutes and 30 seconds. - It's your turn.

2181
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:47,320
Let's invite Hyun Jung and Gyu Ri up.

2182
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:49,789
- Come on up! - What is the next game?

2183
01:25:49,789 --> 01:25:51,959
- This will be our last game. - Yes.

2184
01:25:52,199 --> 01:25:55,360
- It's Egg Roulette! - Egg war!

2185
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:56,999
It's Egg Roulette.

2186
01:25:56,999 --> 01:25:58,570
One will be boiled...

2187
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:00,570
- while the other will be raw. - It's raw.

2188
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:02,409
The two of you will strike...

2189
01:26:02,409 --> 01:26:04,510
the eggs on our heads as hard as you can.

2190
01:26:04,570 --> 01:26:06,440
The one with the raw egg loses.

2191
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:08,039
- We'll put on the name sticker. - That's right!

2192
01:26:08,039 --> 01:26:09,650
How will the last round go?

2193
01:26:09,650 --> 01:26:11,110
Hyun Jung,

2194
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:13,419
this is a live show. Are you nervous?

2195
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:15,279
I'm really nervous.

2196
01:26:15,789 --> 01:26:17,249
- Are you all right? - Yes.

2197
01:26:17,249 --> 01:26:18,350
Where are you coming from?

2198
01:26:18,350 --> 01:26:20,860
We went to visit my grandpa's grave.

2199
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:23,730
You saw how hard our teammates played,

2200
01:26:23,730 --> 01:26:25,600
but we're losing. I really want you to win.

2201
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,129
Gyu Ri, please introduce yourself.

2202
01:26:27,129 --> 01:26:29,930
Hello, I'm Kim Gyu Ri from Incheon. I'm 20 years old.

2203
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:32,270
Gyu Ri, are you the lucky type?

2204
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,239
- No. - You're not?

2205
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:36,110
She's not. Gyu Ri,

2206
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:38,140
I heard that you're a fan of Yang Se Hyung.

2207
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:39,709
Yes, I'm his fan.

2208
01:26:39,709 --> 01:26:40,909
- Really? - You're in front of Se Chan.

2209
01:26:40,909 --> 01:26:42,449
- He's Se Hyung's brother. - What do you think?

2210
01:26:42,449 --> 01:26:43,579
Do you prefer my brother?

2211
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:45,310
Pardon?

2212
01:26:45,310 --> 01:26:46,520
All right, all right.

2213
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:49,190
We don't have time, so we won't interrogate.

2214
01:26:49,190 --> 01:26:50,589
- Please don't. - All right.

2215
01:26:50,589 --> 01:26:52,989
Hyun Jung and Gyu Ri, please step forward.

2216
01:26:52,989 --> 01:26:54,890
- Should we prepare ourselves? - All right.

2217
01:26:55,289 --> 01:26:56,989
Yes, let's get started right away.

2218
01:26:56,989 --> 01:26:58,730
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Hyun Jung and Gyu Ri,

2219
01:26:58,730 --> 01:27:00,129
you don't have to be nice to us.

2220
01:27:00,129 --> 01:27:02,930
Just strike us as hard as you can. Rock-paper-scissors

2221
01:27:02,930 --> 01:27:04,329
- We keep on winning. - Please pick one first.

2222
01:27:04,329 --> 01:27:06,440
- Great. - You too, Hyun Jung.

2223
01:27:06,539 --> 01:27:08,499
- Let's go. - Only one is boiled.

2224
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:11,839
Hit us on our foreheads. 1, 2, 3!

2225
01:27:15,079 --> 01:27:16,110
Great.

2226
01:27:16,749 --> 01:27:17,779
Thank you, Hyun Jung.

2227
01:27:17,779 --> 01:27:19,449
- I lost. - Put it down here.

2228
01:27:19,449 --> 01:27:20,749
- It's fine. - Are you all right?

2229
01:27:20,749 --> 01:27:22,789
- Go wipe your hand. - You can wipe it over there.

2230
01:27:22,989 --> 01:27:24,089
Thank you.

2231
01:27:24,390 --> 01:27:25,789
I lost this time.

2232
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:28,390
Since I lost, we have to put up my name.

2233
01:27:29,730 --> 01:27:32,199
Did we use that again this time?

2234
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:33,400
Great.

2235
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:35,060
Thanks to Hyun Jung, I won.

2236
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:36,869
- Now, we don't have time. - Time...

2237
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:38,900
It'll be our last round.

2238
01:27:38,999 --> 01:27:41,339
Se Chan and I will play rock-paper-scissors...

2239
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:43,409
to stick on the last two names.

2240
01:27:43,409 --> 01:27:44,440
Let's go.

2241
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:45,440
Yes. You and me.

2242
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:46,909
- One against one? - A single-round match.

2243
01:27:46,909 --> 01:27:48,640
- Okay, rock-paper-scissors - Scissors

2244
01:27:48,709 --> 01:27:50,279
- Rock-paper-scissors - I won!

2245
01:27:50,579 --> 01:27:51,650
Okay!

2246
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:53,980
(Se Chan wins!)

2247
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:55,690
This is driving me crazy.

2248
01:27:55,890 --> 01:27:58,589
Okay, we don't have much time. I'm so sorry.

2249
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:01,520
If you see us rushing on the screen,

2250
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:03,089
you would feel anxious too.

2251
01:28:03,089 --> 01:28:05,260
- However, it can't be helped. - I'm putting on two, right?

2252
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:06,430
Last 1. Yes, 2.

2253
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:07,930
Min Ki, please come up.

2254
01:28:09,730 --> 01:28:10,770
All right.

2255
01:28:10,770 --> 01:28:12,100
- This is the last bit. - It's the final.

2256
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:13,800
Thank you for waiting, Min Ki.

2257
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,400
Since we're out of time,

2258
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,310
I need you to turn the roulette right away. Min Ki,

2259
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:18,640
- please turn it well. - Okay.

2260
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:20,810
- Okay. - Please get Se Chan.

2261
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:22,279
- Good luck, Min Ki. - Min Ki.

2262
01:28:22,279 --> 01:28:23,279
All right.

2263
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:24,510
(Final Roulette)

2264
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:25,619
We...

2265
01:28:25,619 --> 01:28:27,220
- We have to put this down. - The penalty...

2266
01:28:27,419 --> 01:28:30,449
Whoever gets picked will get the water bomb.

2267
01:28:30,449 --> 01:28:31,520
Turn it!

2268
01:28:33,959 --> 01:28:36,489
(Their fates lies with this roulette!)

2269
01:28:36,489 --> 01:28:38,360
(Who will get the water bomb?)

2270
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:39,600
Who will it be?

2271
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,499
Please! Please. Please...

2272
01:28:47,369 --> 01:28:48,869
Yu Jae Seok!

2273
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:52,680
(Yu Jae Seok gets the water bomb.)

2274
01:28:57,110 --> 01:28:58,449
- Microphone. - Hand it to me.

2275
01:28:58,949 --> 01:29:00,980
All right. I'm fine.

2276
01:29:01,079 --> 01:29:02,749
Don't worry.

2277
01:29:02,749 --> 01:29:04,390
You got the penalty again.

2278
01:29:04,390 --> 01:29:06,159
We should be saying...

2279
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:07,690
- our last goodbyes. - Yes.

2280
01:29:07,690 --> 01:29:10,329
Whenever I play these games,

2281
01:29:10,329 --> 01:29:12,089
- I see how unlucky I am. - You're unlucky.

2282
01:29:12,089 --> 01:29:13,400
However, I had fun.

2283
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,129
Thank you for joining us today.

2284
01:29:15,499 --> 01:29:17,699
As I've mentioned before,

2285
01:29:17,699 --> 01:29:20,140
- the holiday is almost over. - That's right.

2286
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:22,640
I hope you all spent a lovely, long holiday.

2287
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:24,239
Do you feel refreshed?

2288
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:26,480
It's very refreshing. I want to thank those that helped us.

2289
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,980
Bong Jun, Min Soo, Hyun Jung,

2290
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:29,550
Gyu Ri, Seung Hoon, Ki Young,

2291
01:29:29,550 --> 01:29:31,409
- and also Min Ki. - Min Ki.

2292
01:29:31,409 --> 01:29:34,220
I want to thank all of you that joined us today.

2293
01:29:34,449 --> 01:29:37,089
All of the citizens that participated in our shoot...

2294
01:29:37,089 --> 01:29:39,220
and also the audience joining us at home, thank you.

2295
01:29:39,459 --> 01:29:40,959
We have a minute left.

2296
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:42,289
We rushed,

2297
01:29:42,289 --> 01:29:43,890
- and now there's a minute left. - You told us to rush.

2298
01:29:43,890 --> 01:29:45,699
We have a minute left now.

2299
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:49,369
- We have about 50 seconds left. - About 50 seconds.

2300
01:29:49,369 --> 01:29:52,440
We were saying goodbye, and it didn't occur to us.

2301
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:54,039
Today, you came...

2302
01:29:54,039 --> 01:29:57,070
all the way to a rest stop and proved how unlucky you are.

2303
01:29:57,070 --> 01:29:58,110
How do you feel?

2304
01:29:58,110 --> 01:29:59,339
Aside from how I feel,

2305
01:29:59,339 --> 01:30:00,409
I...

2306
01:30:00,709 --> 01:30:03,279
My pants are really wet right now.

2307
01:30:03,279 --> 01:30:04,680
- Do you feel damp? - It's damp.

2308
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,150
- That is Chuseok. - Yes.

2309
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:07,720
Chuseok should be damp.

2310
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:09,650
- It should be damp? - Yes.

2311
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:10,989
- Is that so? - Yes.

2312
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:13,659
Anyway, I think we can take our time...

2313
01:30:13,659 --> 01:30:15,989
- to say our goodbyes. - Yes.

2314
01:30:15,989 --> 01:30:17,890
I suddenly thought of this.

2315
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:20,699
We're always rushing too much with our lives.

2316
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:22,669
It just occurred to me.

2317
01:30:22,669 --> 01:30:24,699
- We could have taken it slowly. - Yes.

2318
01:30:24,699 --> 01:30:26,600
We rushed too much.

2319
01:30:26,869 --> 01:30:29,070
My microphone was put on in a rush.

2320
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:30,869
- It's such a mess. - Yes.

2321
01:30:30,869 --> 01:30:32,209
The lines are tangled.

2322
01:30:32,209 --> 01:30:34,440
- There are seven seconds left. - We should say bye.

2323
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:36,510
We'll send you our goodbyes now.

2324
01:30:36,579 --> 01:30:38,480
Dear everyone, please look forward...

2325
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:41,350
- to next week. Bye! - Bye!

2326
01:30:48,589 --> 01:30:50,730
(Next week)

2327
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,529
(It's finally here.)

2328
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:59,369
(They need to decide who will join him in the crocodile cage.)

2329
01:30:59,369 --> 01:31:04,510
(Mission name: Find Kwang Soo's Assistant)

2330
01:31:05,239 --> 01:31:06,909
(Shin Sung Rok)

2331
01:31:06,909 --> 01:31:08,409
(Yoon Bo Mi)

2332
01:31:09,610 --> 01:31:11,949
(No one knows...)

2333
01:31:11,949 --> 01:31:14,879
(about their mysterious existence.)

2334
01:31:14,879 --> 01:31:17,050
(The clues about the assistant...)

2335
01:31:17,050 --> 01:31:19,489
(will be revealed one by one.)

2336
01:31:21,419 --> 01:31:22,860
(It's him?)

2337
01:31:26,329 --> 01:31:28,459
(They must be eliminated!)

2338
01:31:29,270 --> 01:31:31,600
(Find the Assistant)
