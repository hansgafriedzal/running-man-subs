00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,770
(It's the first Sunday of 2017, the Year of the Chicken.)

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,530
(A special ceremony for the new year is prepared.)

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,900
(2017 Running Man Kickoff)

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,370
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,970
- It's Hwan. - Nice to meet you.

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,070
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,370
- It's Hwan. - Happy New Year.

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,170
- Happy New Year. - Hello.

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,870
- Hello. - It's a kickoff.

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,870
- Please stand in a line. - Okay.

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,500
We will now begin...

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,670
- Running Man kickoff of 2017. - All right.

13
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,500
It's a new year. Please tell the viewers...

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,230
about your New Year's resolutions.

15
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,900
- Okay. - You go first, Haha.

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,430
(Haha will speak first.)

17
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,500
For the New Year...

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,070
(Stuttering)

19
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,500
I will round this year off.

20
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,670
(He's getting laughed at since the start of the year.)

21
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,000
I will try my best and stay healthy.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
(Please become a grown up this year, Haha.)

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,330
- You can go next, Seok Jin. - Okay.

24
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,530
Staying healthy is the best.

25
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,330
I got a checkup last year.

26
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,170
- Really? - How did it go?

27
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,940
They said I screamed a lot when I was doing endoscopy under sedation.

28
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,100
I became a baby all of a sudden and said,

29
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,600
"Please..."

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,530
(He became a baby.)

31
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,170
- My wife was... - That's so scary.

32
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,470
- very embarrassed. - You sounded so scary.

33
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,200
I think you were possessed.

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,330
(50-year-old baby ghost)

35
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,900
- It was a baby ghost. - That could be possible.

36
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,870
My wife was very embarrassed.

37
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,000
My priority is also staying healthy.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,270
I will keep staying healthy...

39
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,770
and continue to be a health preacher.

40
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,700
How exactly are you going to be a health preacher?

41
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,170
Staying healthy doesn't make you a health preacher.

42
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,930
I wish a day would come...

43
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,870
when Jong Kook turns 80...

44
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,800
and appear on "How is that Possible"...

45
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,000
with his bulky body.

46
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,900
- I think I could do that. - Right?

47
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,800
- You would be shirtless. - I can see that happening.

48
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,730
You could show off your back muscles.

49
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,470
(The secret behind 80-year-old Jong Kook's body)

50
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,270
"Let's find out how Jong Kook manages to stay fit."

51
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,470
You could do this to your daughter-in-law.

52
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,570
(The grandpa uses his daughter-in-law to play basketball.)

53
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,770
He's so full of energy.

54
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,000
I could do that.

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,130
What a way to celebrate your 80th birthday.

56
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,870
I'll make sure that happens.

57
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,370
If I want to see that, I'd have to stay alive.

58
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,270
- Right. - Please stay alive for long.

59
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,930
I'll do that.

60
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,100
Kwang Soo?

61
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,500
For this year, I wish everyone happiness...

62
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,300
including my family and the viewers.

63
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,970
Personally, I hope Jong Kook gets married.

64
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,170
- That was random. - What?

65
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,730
I wanted to cheer you up.

66
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,130
(May Jong Kook get married in 2017.)

67
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,170
I wish many good things happen not to just us,

68
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,270
- but to all the viewers. - Of course.

69
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,530
- I wish them happiness. - I do, too.

70
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,500
We'll try really hard...

71
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,630
to make you laugh.

72
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,070
Everyone, Happy New Year.

73
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,070
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

74
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,270
To celebrate a new year,

75
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,330
we'll announce the launch of Running Man's new project.

76
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,330
Oh, my goodness.

77
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,870
(What is that?)

78
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,430
What is that?

79
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,900
2017 Running Man Project.

80
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,870
- Member's Week. - Member's Week.

81
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,230
(Member's Week?)

82
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,900
It's Running Man's New Year project for 2017.

83
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,000
It's Member's Week.

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,530
A project has been prepared for your seven years of hard work.

85
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,870
Each week, members of Running Man...

86
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,970
will each choose an item of their liking and go on a race.

87
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,970
Seok Jin.

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This is amazing.

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,570
(This is amazing.)

90
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,970
Can we team up?

91
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,300
Please tell us if there are specific items you prefer.

92
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,800
There was a project Seok Jin and I were seriously working on.

93
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,600
- What is it? - If we can do whatever we want,

94
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,000
we'd like to do that project.

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
- You can do whatever you want. - Really?

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,700
I can't talk about it.

97
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,730
- We two have the main roles. - Don't talk about it.

98
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,900
- We're the leading roles. - We'll destroy everyone.

99
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,700
- You'll destroy everyone? - Watch your mouth.

100
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,330
Get ready to get imprisoned.

101
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,870
Should I get my water gun ready?

102
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,130
(Jae Seok threatens them.)

103
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,800
Do you want me to spray you?

104
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,500
(Should I wake Jae Seok Bond up from his sleep?)

105
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,530
You're all done for once I ready my water gun.

106
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,430
What about you, Ji Hyo?

107
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,970
I wish we could all go on a trip together.

108
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,970
- Without cameras. - Without cameras?

109
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,870
How are we supposed to record it then?

110
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,430
Think before you speak.

111
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,170
You asked me what I wanted to do.

112
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,930
We'll get to go on a trip. Don't worry about that.

113
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,500
- I really wish for that to happen. - All right.

114
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,000
- A real trip? - We could record it ourselves.

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I wish I could personally train all of you.

116
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,730
(Do you want to get personally trained by Jong Kook?)

117
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:47,170
It'll be called "Jong Kook's Intense Training".

118
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,700
Why do you keep trying to give us a hard time?

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,730
- Did we do wrong by you? - What did we do so wrong?

120
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,000
I won't go easy on you.

121
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,270
Member's Week will start next week.

122
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,000
- Really? - For such reason,

123
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,530
we'll choose the first runner...

124
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,900
to start off the first race.

125
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,270
The winner of the race will get an R Ball.

126
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,500
- It's the R Ball again. - It's been quite a long time.

127
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,000
It'll be a lot of pressure to be the first runner.

128
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,600
There are benefits for the first runner.

129
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,370
The winner will be given water bombs to clarify the body and soul.

130
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,130
(Water bombs for clarifying body and soul)

131
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,270
(The ice bath will refresh you to the bones.)

132
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,200
There will be a purifying bath.

133
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,070
(How is that a benefit?)

134
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,800
You call that purifying? It's a penalty.

135
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,130
(They're frozen up already.)

136
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,370
The first runner will choose...

137
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,770
the next runner of the following week.

138
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,500
(Member's Week will continue until all members get selected.)

139
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,530
- Will it be like a relay? - You could do that.

140
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,900
With a big project coming up,

141
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,370
it's important to get yourself checked out.

142
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,370
We'll get moving...

143
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,770
to have our fortunes told.

144
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,770
- Shall we do that? - Yes.

145
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,300
- Let's get moving. - Let's go.

146
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,230
(Announcement of Running Man's 2017 Project)

147

(Running Man Checkup: New Year Fortune Telling)

148
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,500
(It'll be a time to take a peak at Running Man's fortune.)

149
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,870
This mission is called The Fortune Race.

150
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,800
We will tell your fortune of this year.

151
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,000
The person with the best fortune told...

152
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,770
will get to decide on which game we'll play first.

153
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,730
Fortuneteller Park Sung Joon will help us today.

154
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,800
(Fortuneteller Park Sung Joon will read Running Man's fortune.)

155
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,470
He's the fortuneteller from last year.

156
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,230
- Hello. - Hello.

157
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,870
He's got quite a sharp tongue.

158
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,500
(You should stay still for 2016.)

159
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:41,000
(Park Sung Joon started 2016 off by making spiteful remarks.)

160
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,230
(He gave everyone a mental breakdown by giving them pieces of advice.)

161
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,870
He'll read each of your fortunes.

162
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,330
- Should I go first? - You should go first.

163
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,270
Seok Jin is very curious right now.

164
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,530
Please listen to him this year.

165
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,630
- I should. - Last year,

166
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,500
- you didn't listen to him. - He told you not to do anything.

167
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,470
He argued with him.

168
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,330
(Seok Jin was full of hopes and dreams for 2016.)

169
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,000
(It'll be better if you just stay still.)

170
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,430
(Seok Jin was told to stay still.)

171
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,930
Last year, I told you to stay still.

172
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,070
- For this year... - This is important.

173
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,330
(Can I move around this year?)

174
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,900
You should stay still again.

175
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,430
(He should stay still again.)

176
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,500
(It's been 2 consecutive years.)

177
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,370
Really? What did you say?

178
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,630
He has to stay still again?

179
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,900
(Is he a statue?)

180
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,000
Living isn't living for him.

181
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,600
Seok Jin has to stay still again?

182
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,270
Shouldn't I at least do something?

183
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,230
It's a windy season so if you decide to do something,

184
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,700
you should keep your head down and lay down flat.

185
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,630
(Keep your head down and lay down flat.)

186
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,500
How much longer does he have to crawl?

187
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,000
- That's what you need to do. - I need to keep my head down?

188
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,330
After 3 or 4 years, you will finally get lucky.

189
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,070
I'll be 60 by then.

190
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,070
(He'll be a grandpa by then.)

191
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,700
That's true.

192
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,000
- You won't get lucky until 2020. - 2020?

193
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,130
Don't you think you'll have a grandson by then?

194
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,130
- He has to stay still until 2020? - This is driving me crazy.

195
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,970
This feels a lot like last year.

196
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,230
Your keyword of this year is...

197
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,900
"No Investing".

198
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,170
(Seok Jin's keyword for this year is "No Investing".)

199
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,900
(I have to stay still and can't even invest my money?)

200
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,000
Mr. Park. What if...

201
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,500
he has already invested some money? Should he retrieve the investment?

202
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,770
When did you invest your money?

203
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,800
I started investing seriously since last year.

204
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,200
- Since last year? - Yes.

205
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,000
You shouldn't put more money in.

206
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,170
(He recommends freezing his account.)

207
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,270
I recommend you retrieve your investment...

208
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,600
- as soon as possible. - It's funny because he's serious.

209
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,800
(Is there anything I can do?)

210
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't know if he's speaking from the bottom of his heart but...

211
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,770
We go see fortunetellers in the beginning of a new year...

212
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,500
- to get hope. - That's right.

213
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,270
That didn't sound hopeful at all.

214
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,970
I've done this before. They usually give you at least one good news.

215
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,170
There's nothing good about what he's saying.

216
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,740
Seok Jin, you should go back to your seat now.

217
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,000
(Looks like I'll be unlucky this year again.)

218
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,600
Please stay still, Seok Jin.

219
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,740
(Don't invest your money and lay down flat.)

220
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,100
Seok Jin, stay still.

221
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:21,270
Haha was born as land.

222
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,630
- I get that a lot. - He's a rich land.

223
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,330
It's a big and rich tract of land.

224
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,700
That's good.

225
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,600
There's even water. It has a good environment.

226
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,670
However, there aren't any trees to plant there.

227
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,000
That means you want to harvest, but you don't have...

228
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,070
any crops to plant.

229
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,970
I don't know why that is. I'm not getting any results.

230
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,770
One good thing about you...

231
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,370
is that your children are your hope.

232
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,630
- Dream. - That's very good news.

233
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,130
- That's good news. - Only your children...

234
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,630
can make you feel stable.

235
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,370
Really?

236
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,470
He used to be such a brat.

237
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,000
He's become a changed man after he got married and had a child.

238
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
(He is no longer a brat thanks to Dream.)

239
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,700
(Kicking)

240
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,630
(If it wasn't for Dream, he would be much worse now.)

241
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,970
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

242
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,800
You should have many children.

243
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,430
The more children you give birth to, the better.

244
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,570
- I see. - Really?

245
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,200
In terms of your fortune,

246
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,430
there is no powerful, determining force.

247
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,100
(It's good to have many children, but there is no powerful force.)

248
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,570
What does that mean?

249
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,170
What does it mean?

250
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,900
He wants to have more children, but his situation doesn't allow it.

251
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,830
(He is flustered.)

252
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,930
How can you see that?

253
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,070
- Gosh. - I'm being serious.

254
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,000
It surprises me these days.

255
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,630
It's too difficult.

256
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,470
Gosh, is that so?

257
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,070
- Despite all that, - How did he know?

258
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,470
the more children you have, the better it is.

259
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:49,170
Your keyword for the year 2017 is...

260
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,300
"Keep Your Head Down with Seok Jin".

261
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,630
That's the best thing to do this year.

262
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,800
- Let's not do anything together. - That's your fortune this year.

263
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,570
- Haha's is the same as Seok Jin's. - Stay down on your stomach.

264
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,870
It wasn't so bad.

265
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,270
(He's disappointed by his fortune reading.)

266
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,930
(Haha's hopes are his children.)

267
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,730
(Stay low with Seok Jin.)

268
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,500
Jong Kook, your fortune...

269
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,800
for this year is that you'll be stronger in maintaining your life.

270
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,530
Your greed for money and women...

271
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,970
(He gets extremely greedy about money and romance.)

272
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,130
Is that finally happening?

273
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,930
Wait a minute.

274
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,370
Jong Kook, remember the rich woman whom you mentioned?

275
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,300
- Remember the rich woman? - What?

276
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,700
You said she was rich.

277
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,000
Have you lost your mind? Whom are you talking about?

278
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,130
He must know someone who's wealthy.

279
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,670
- He's been busy with his finances. - I'm really interested...

280
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,930
because I want to meet a good woman these days.

281
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,770
In terms of your romantic life,

282
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,200
stop analyzing.

283
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,470
- Gosh, please stop analyzing. - Seriously.

284
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,370
- You can't analyze women. - Right.

285
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,430
You need to open up your heart more.

286
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,900
Jong Kook, this is your keyword for this year.

287
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,230
"The Time to Make New Changes".

288
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:03,930
Changes in your life could be good for you...

289
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,730
if you follow through.

290
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,000
Whom should I follow?

291
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,630
- You're great with Ji Hyo. - Really?

292
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,470
- Ji Hyo is good in many ways. - That's true.

293
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,670
I might be getting ahead of myself,

294
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,200
but it'd be best if Ji Hyo and Jong Kook got married.

295
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,730
- What are you talking about? - Let's have them get married.

296
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,130
What are you talking about?

297
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,330
- She's the rich woman. - Ji Hyo is...

298
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,870
really rich.

299
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,130
- What's wrong with Ji Hyo? - She bought me a fan before.

300
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,230
Why can't it be her?

301
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:30,230
- She's like family. - She'd be perfect.

302
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,630
Ji Hyo, think about it.

303
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,000
You never know how life will turn out.

304
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,600
The score of your match with Ji Hyo is 85 to 90 out of 100.

305
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
(Ji Hyo and Jong Kook make a 90-point couple.)

306
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,500
- 90 points? - Is that good?

307
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,530
You should live together.

308
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,830
- Do you mean me and Ji Hyo? - She showed her interest.

309
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,930
Okay, thank you.

310
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,770
Gary would be disappointed if he hears this.

311
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,600
Sir, please take a look at it one more time!

312
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,070
Sir, please!

313
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,900
- That's big news. - They get 90 points?

314
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,770
("The Time to Make New Changes")

315
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,370
(He may get lucky financially and romantically.)

316
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,130
Ji Hyo, based on your fortune,

317
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,470
you were born as a thirsty tree in the summer.

318
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,230
The summer is hot and lacks water.

319
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,330
That's why you always seem thirsty for something.

320
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,100
Jong Kook is your great source of water.

321
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,370
(They're a perfect match.)

322
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,900
- There you go. - Does Jong Kook represent water?

323
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,800
You're a good match as he waters a thirsty tree like you.

324
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,070
This year...

325
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,530
is when you get your hands on money.

326
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,230
(She's surprised.)

327
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,100
Suddenly, she stretched out her arms.

328
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,930
She did.

329
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,000
(She feels more confident.)

330
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,170
In terms of your romantic life,

331
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,900
you've had strange and lowly men around you.

332
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,930
(She's had strange and lowly men around her.)

333
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,330
Don't say it that way.

334
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,600
- Do you mean us? - Is that us?

335
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,170
- We're not lowly men. - That sounds funny.

336
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,870
They're the closest men around me.

337
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,500
- That was funny. - Are we lowly?

338
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,130
Did you hear that, Gary?

339
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,100
Gary is one of them.

340
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,300
As those unnecessary men get out of your life,

341
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:05,670
the time for you to meet a good partner...

342
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,970
is this year.

343
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,200
That makes me feel sad.

344
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,300
Your weakness in your romantic life is that...

345
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,800
you have high standards for men.

346
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,430
- Really? - No, she doesn't.

347
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,670
You have high standards.

348
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,700
However, even if you choose someone based on your standards,

349
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,670
it's likely that he's strange.

350
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,800
(She has the worst judgment when it comes to men.)

351
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:33,970
In other words, only she thinks that she has high standards.

352
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,400
It's okay as long as she's happy.

353
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,470
You choose men based on your own standards,

354
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,530
but it's hard for others to accept him.

355
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,930
You may have high standards, but you have bad judgment.

356
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,970
That's why you may find an unusual man.

357
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,300
That's why she's working with us.

358
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,570
(Lower your standards and make better judgments.)

359
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,770
- It's like us who aren't so smart. - Right.

360
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,900
- I bet Kwang Soo is lucky. - Last year,

361
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,000
- Kwang Soo's fortune was the best. - Is that so?

362
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:02,400
(Both Kwang Soo and Jong Kook had good fortunes in 2016.)

363
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,800
(Kwang Soo was selected as the luckiest in 2016.)

364
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,270
Kwang Soo was the luckiest.

365
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,370
Kwang Soo, you're already accomplished,

366
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,330
but your willingness and desire to grow are excessive.

367
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,270
- Right now? - You want to do better.

368
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,930
You're almost 2m tall, Kwang Soo.

369
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,000
Do you want to be 3m tall?

370
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,130
That's not it.

371
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,270
That's why you always feel frustrated.

372
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,930
- Frustrated? - Yes.

373
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,400
- You're lonely. - Right.

374
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,630
- You feel inadequate. - That's correct.

375
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,830
- And... - He can't sleep alone.

376
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,270
your personality is...

377
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,430
What are you talking about?

378
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:43,370
(Has he lost his mind?)

379
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:48,770
(Stop talking nonsense on the first day of the new year.)

380
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,100
(Laughing)

381
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,370
You have many thoughts.

382
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,870
- Kwang Soo thinks a lot. - Many thoughts are on your mind.

383
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,000
You also daydream a lot, too.

384
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,730
Does he daydream?

385
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,800
Your fortune regarding romance this year...

386
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,970
is that you desperately want to find a woman, but there aren't any.

387
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,000
(There's no woman available to him.)

388
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,230
Could you read the fortune again?

389
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,670
- That's the worst. - Why?

390
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,700
Why isn't there any?

391
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,900
He desperately wants to find one, but there isn't any.

392
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,170
Kwang Soo, you and I are quite similar.

393
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,970
Since you feel lonely very often,

394
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,370
you fall in love easily.

395
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,530
- That's right. - That's true.

396
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,470
- You fall in love at first sight. - That's right.

397
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,270
He's an easy guy.

398
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,770
What are you talking about?

399
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:37,130
- Don't you think so? - That was too rude.

400
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,270
What's wrong?

401
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,870
He's easy because he falls in love easily.

402
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,200
How could he say that?

403
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,470
- You fall in love easily. - What does that supposed to mean?

404
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,530
Don't misunderstand me.

405
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,470
You fall in love easily.

406
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,670
What do you mean?

407
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,600
I meant that you're a man who falls in love easily.

408
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,700
- That still sounds rude. - I'm an easy guy?

409
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,900
(Kwang Soo is ready to argue.)

410
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,070
Kwang Soo, don't misunderstand.

411
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,870
I just said he falls in love easily.

412
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,800
- I'm sorry about that. - Many thoughts are on your mind.

413
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,900
Since you aren't good at expressing yourself,

414
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,670
the thoughts only stay in your head.

415
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,470
The other person wasn't even thinking about it,

416
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,370
but you think you're in a relationship.

417
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,000
Is that how it is?

418
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That's right.

419
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,270
You're amazing, Sir.

420
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,500
- That's completely true. - It's true.

421
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,800
He gets into relationships and breaks up all by himself.

422
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,470
I broke up with about 30 people this year.

423
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,970
- He threw a birthday party alone. - You're full of imaginations.

424
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,700
You imagine as if you're dating someone.

425
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,300
You feel impatient, and you consider yourself as her boyfriend already.

426
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,570
In other words,

427
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,470
you're full of desire and passion,

428
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,530
but your plans don't usually come to fruition.

429
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,700
However,

430
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,570
when you meet Jong Kook, the story changes.

431
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,900
A tree should be rooted in the ground, but when you meet him,

432
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,400
the ground gets muddy.

433
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,570
- Muddy? - You can't establish roots.

434
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,500
- Does it turn into poop water? - It becomes muddy.

435
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,730
Muddy?

436
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,670
Don't they usually meet...

437
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,530
- each other often? - They hang out together the most.

438
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,970
- Does it become muddy? - They hang out the most.

439
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,530
- They meet each other often. - He said it becomes muddy.

440
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,900
The tree can't photosynthesize because there's no sun.

441
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,770
If it can't root in the ground, it can only float.

442
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,670
I've never heard something bad like this.

443
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,700
His fortune is similar to mine.

444
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,130
I suggest...

445
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,600
to distance yourself from Jong Kook.

446
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,270
The person you're good to work with is Jae Seok.

447
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,440
Really?

448
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,470
When you meet him, it's not only good for him,

449
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,200
but it's also good for you.

450
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,530
Keep close to Jae Seok and distance yourself from Jong Kook.

451
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,170
Kwang Soo, you can live in one of the rooms at my house.

452
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,770
I have an extra room.

453
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,470
We heard the same thing last year.

454
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,630
- That's right. - Right.

455
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,870
(Do what matters the most.)

456
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:49,440
(Avoid Jong Kook and stay close to Jae Seok.)

457
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,400
Jae Seok, you're a giving person...

458
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,200
- and have people's support. - I do?

459
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,630
You may seem friendly but...

460
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,100
you distance yourself from others except close friends and family.

461
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,130
- That's right. - That's why...

462
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,170
I don't have that many close friends.

463
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,670
- That's why you don't have hobbies. - Right.

464
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,830
There's not much going on in your life.

465
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,570
- That's true. - I feel bad for him.

466
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,100
- All I do is... - I feel bad for Jae Seok.

467
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,330
hang out with my close friends. I don't do much else.

468
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:20,130
- I'd like to tell you something. - What is it?

469
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,770
This is your keyword this year.

470
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,370
- This is your keyword. - I'm curious.

471
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,230
"Be Devoted to Your Wife".

472
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,200
("Be Devoted to Your Wife")

473
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,500
You should have a second child.

474
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,800
That's my wish.

475
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:34,570
Your wife can also be a daughter to you.

476
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,570
She wants to receive a lot of unconditional love.

477
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,900
That's something you can work on.

478
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,170
I'd like to travel more with her,

479
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,000
but I didn't have the chance yet.

480
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,400
My plan is to travel more this year.

481
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,770
You should be more devoted to your wife this year.

482
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,940
- I plan to do that. - Take care of her like a daughter.

483
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,440
- You need to focus more on her. - Okay.

484
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,800
There's one thing you should be careful about.

485
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,330
Your fortune says that you may have a health problem this year.

486
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,600
Let's start training from tomorrow.

487
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,400
You lose more energy when you meet Haha.

488
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
(Haha sucks the energy out of people.)

489
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,370
- Why is it always him? - He sucks everyone's energy.

490
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,600
- I'm already tired. - What is wrong with him?

491
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,700
My goodness.

492
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,940
You don't know why, but he'll drain your energy out.

493
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,100
- That's the chemistry. - There's no reason?

494
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,900
What about my chemistry with Seok Jin?

495
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,070
When you meet Seok Jin, he reminds you of money.

496
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,940
- He reminds me of money? - He does...

497
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,870
and he provokes the ambition for you...

498
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,370
to be more active in the society.

499
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,100
- That's right. - Seok Jin...

500
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,440
He gives me a lot of suggestions.

501
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,330
- That's right. - It's right.

502
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,770
I want to own an organic bakery with Jae Seok.

503
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,300
He keeps on offering the idea to me.

504
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,130
- He mentioned it several times. - Jae Seok will bake.

505
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,300
But you don't go well with bakeries.

506
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,870
- What suits him, then? - What suits me?

507
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,940
- What suits him? - He wants to open a business.

508
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,730
- What suits him? - Tell us.

509
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,940
What is it?

510
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,370
- What should he do? - How...

511
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,530
- Would nothing work out for him? - What am I supposed to do?

512
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:05,100
Seok Jin is patient...

513
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,970
- Should he wait? - What about charity work?

514
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,130
What about charity work?

515
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,000
(He's forced to do charity work.)

516
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,630
- That's right. - You should do some good deeds.

517
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,130
You should.

518
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,070
This is funny.

519
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,470
Thank you. He was right...

520
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,130
- about everyone. - He was close.

521
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,000
Let's give the fortuneteller a round of applause for joining us.

522
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,900
- Thank you. - Thank you.

523
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,870
- Thank you. - Thanks so much.

524
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,500
He was so funny. He made me laugh.

525
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,770
My feet are numb.

526
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,200
Did your feet fall asleep?

527
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,940
- My feet are numb. - Are you okay?

528
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,230
(He's about to fall.)

529
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,230
(Slipping)

530
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,170
(He can't get up by himself.)

531
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,100
- What's the matter with him? - What's going on?

532
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,400
(Gathering)

533
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,930
You should take care of yourself.

534
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,530
You should take care of yourself first.

535
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,830
Don't worry about me.

536
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,730
- What's going on? - He has to lie down.

537
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,570
- He has to lie down. - Lie down.

538
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,070
What's the matter with him?

539
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,400
What's going on?

540
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,330
- Sir. - His feet are numb.

541
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,170
You should join me at the gym tomorrow.

542
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,770
Don't do anything this year.

543
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,370
You should stay at home.

544
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,430
You should lie down at home.

545
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,330
- Don't do anything. - Are you all right?

546
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,800
You told me not to do anything. You shouldn't either.

547
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,000
(Limping)

548
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,800
Sorry.

549
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,270
He was so funny.

550
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,630
That was today's best moment.

551
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,670
- That was the best moment. - He's so funny.

552
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:34,130
We had the fortuneteller interpret our 2017.

553
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,600
I'll reveal who have the best fortune for the new year...

554
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,200
- out of the Running Man members. - You have the order?

555
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,270
- I'll reveal 6th place. - It's 6th place?

556
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,470
- It's the last. - All right. It goes to...

557
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,930
(Who has the worst fortune for Year of the Chicken?)

558
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,370
(I hope it's not me.)

559
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,000
It's Seok Jin.

560
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,900
- I'm not surprised. - That was anti-climactic.

561
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,370
- I'm not surprised either. - That was predictable.

562
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,500
(It follows the fortuneteller's predictions.)

563
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,730
Haha is in fifth place.

564
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,130
(Haha in 5th place)

565
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,400
It hasn't changed from last year.

566
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,570
That's right.

567
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,730
In fourth place is Ji Hyo.

568
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,130
- Ji Hyo is in fourth place? - She is.

569
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
In third place...

570
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,870
is Jong Kook.

571
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,000
- It's the same as last year. - Is it him and me?

572
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,270
It's similar from last year.

573
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,930
We have 1st and 2nd places remaining.

574
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,930
First place goes to...

575
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:26,930
(Who will have the best luck for Year of the Chicken?)

576
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:28,930
Kwang Soo.

577
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,870
(Kwang Soo is the man of Year of the Chicken.)

578
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,630
Congratulations.

579
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,570
It was the same for last year.

580
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,130
- It was. - It's the same.

581
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,730
With everything combined,

582
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,070
- Kwang Soo scores first place. - That's great.

583
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,530
That's right. He's still young.

584
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,130
- He has a bright future. - The first game of 2017...

585
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:48,230
is called "When the Chicken Lays".

586
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,670
"When the Chicken Lays"?

587
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,670
Kwang Soo have the best fortune...

588
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,700
so you can pick the order that each person will go.

589
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:58,700
There's a chicken toy that lays eggs but you don't know when.

590
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,800
You can press the button three times at a maximum.

591
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,370
If the chicken lays eggs during your turn,

592
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,630
- you're eliminated. - They're eliminated.

593
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,830
- It's easy, right? - All right.

594
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,130
The last person to stay alive will get 50 R Balls.

595
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,070
- That many? - You can give them to others...

596
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,200
but you must keep one at least.

597
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,130
- That's good. - It's bad to have them, right?

598
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,200
- That's right. - It's no good.

599
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,530
We might get the water bucket.

600
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,470
Kwang Soo, please designate the order.

601
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,770
I'll have everybody move up one and I'll go to the end.

602
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,900
- Really? - You're going last?

603
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,770
I need to distance myself from Jong Kook and get close to Jae Seok.

604
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,800
- That's fine. - He's doing as the fortune says.

605
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,970
- Let's listen to the fortune. - All right.

606
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,330
- I'll go first. - You're first?

607
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:38,700
- Kwang Soo is first. - Am I last place?

608
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,070
That punk.

609
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,000
- Do you see the egg? - Where does it come out from?

610
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,830
You need to press the egg three times.

611
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,530
- It's three maximum, right? - Right.

612
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:48,400
(If he gets unlucky, he might get the water bucket.)

613
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,800
(Who would be the first unlucky one of the new year?)

614
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,470
That was one.

615
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,670
That was one.

616
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,400
- That's two. - Hey.

617
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,300
- It's totally luck. - Totally?

618
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,830
(Should I do another click or not?)

619
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,430
It clicks. Stop. Yes.

620
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,100
- All right, Kwang Soo. - Yes.

621
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,670
It clicks. Stop. Yes.

622
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,600
(Kwang Soo gets the first egg.)

623
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,330
- All right, Kwang Soo. - Yes.

624
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,400
- You're first to be eliminated. - Look what happens.

625
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,100
(His bad luck continues in the new year.)

626
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,630
- He's unlucky. - He still is.

627
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,630
- You need to stay by me. - This is weird.

628
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,930
- Our luck shows here. - He didn't pick properly.

629
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,600
- This is interesting. - It is.

630
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,770
That's what unlucky ones are like.

631
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,500
- This is interesting. - It is.

632
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,430
- Kwang Soo is eliminated. - It's unpleasant to see the egg.

633
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,100
It rolled out. It made me mad.

634
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,200
I agree it looks unpleasant.

635
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,400
- We'll start again with Jae Seok. - We'll start again.

636
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,970
Press it hard. That's one.

637
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,800
(He passes it on after one click.)

638
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,000
No way.

639
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,470
(Here's the egg.)

640
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,170
How can I believe this?

641
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,470
(What's going on?)

642
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:00,300
- How can I believe this? - You've been eliminated.

643
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,770
Look at the egg.

644
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,870
I don't understand. I only pressed it once.

645
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,870
Seok Jin is eliminated as well.

646
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,900
You guys are so unlucky.

647
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,000
Let's start again with Ji Hyo.

648
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,700
- Once. - Twice,

649
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,330
and three. Aren't you scared?

650
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,730
- Haha is next. - She must be at ease.

651
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,930
Once, twice.

652
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,400
(Would Haha choose to go again?)

653
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,570
(I don't know.)

654
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,070
- Here's the egg. - Oh, dear.

655
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,600
(Oh my goodness!)

656
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,000
- You're eliminated. - Why were you being greedy?

657
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,630
You shouldn't have done it.

658
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,570
- What's wrong with you? - You didn't have to press it.

659
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,130
You could have stopped at two.

660
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,270
Why did you do that? This kid.

661
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,930
- You should have stopped. - That was unfortunate.

662
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,500
We have three people left.

663
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,000
(Jong Kook, Ji Hyo and Jae Seok are left.)

664
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,700
Once.

665
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,670
Once.

666
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,100
- Ji Hyo. - All once?

667
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,200
Ji Hyo.

668
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,000
Ji Hyo.

669
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,230
(Here's the egg.)

670
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,000
(I miss my luck.)

671
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,700
- Ji Hyo is eliminated. - It lays eggs every time.

672
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,300
It comes out near the end.

673
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,100
- We have two people left. - It could have been you.

674
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,330
- Who will take... - It's love and hatred relationship.

675
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,230
- 50 R Balls? - We'll see.

676
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,270
- My gosh. - Whoever wins...

677
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,770
- will get 50 R Balls. - It's 50 R Balls.

678
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,000
Go ahead.

679
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,300
(We meet again.)

680
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,730
(Who will be the first winner of the new year?)

681
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,070
Jong Kook goes first.

682
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,800
Once.

683
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,470
(Clicking)

684
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,230
Just once?

685
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:37,830
(Clicking)

686
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,700
- Don't hesitate. - Go again.

687
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,170
(He hesitates.)

688
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,370
- Go again. It's okay. - Go.

689
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,900
(Here you go.)

690
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:51,400
Something spilled from your mouth. You must be nervous.

691
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,770
Who will be the last one standing?

692
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:56,600
(Is this how you want to do it?)

693
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,500
(Please lay the egg.)

694
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,000
(Their fates can change at any moment.)

695
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,330
Who will it be?

696
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:04,600
(Clicking)

697
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,430
(Will he go or stop? That is the question.)

698
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:11,000
(What will Jong Kook do?)

699
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,430
Don't hesitate.

700
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
(He goes again.)

701
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,630
(Jae Seok feels the pressure.)

702
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,870
I bet my entire savings on Jong Kook's win.

703
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,670
(Here's the egg.)

704
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:33,300
(Sorrow)

705
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,830
(Joy)

706
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,270
Congratulations. Jong Kook is in first place.

707
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,100
It's not anything new.

708
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:41,470
- Why does it never work out for me? - It's not anything new.

709
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,600
Jong Kook will be awarded with 50 R Balls.

710
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,670
It's not anything new.

711
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,530
Why does it not work?

712
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,230
You can distribute the R Balls.

713
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,330
It's obviously not good to have a lot of them.

714
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,470
However, you must keep one at least.

715
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:59,230
- You can't distribute everything. - I'll keep one.

716
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,130
You can distribute the rest.

717
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,700
Should we play another game with 10 R Balls?

718
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,670
- Let's go. - Should we give it to one person?

719
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,930
- Should we? Let's do a hand flip... - All right.

720
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,930
- Okay. - and whoever faces the wrong way...

721
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,870
- will take the R Balls. - Bring your hands to the middle.

722
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,270
It'll be the person who faces the wrong side.

723
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,070
- Do it. - Isn't Jong Kook doing it too?

724
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,700
- He's not. - Why would I?

725
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,330
- Kwang Soo. - No, I'm sorry.

726
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,530
I was just asking.

727
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,900
Thank you.

728
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,230
(Lee Kwang Soo)

729
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,500
- The loser... - That wasn't funny, right?

730
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,430
That was all right.

731
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,600
- Thank you. I appreciate it. - That was all right?

732
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,970
- That was all right? - Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

733
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,370
What should our next game be?

734
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,100
- Let's pull on people's sideburns. - That's a good idea.

735
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,800
That's a good idea. What do you think about the game, Kwang Soo?

736
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,930
I think it's great.

737
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,170
Should we do this?

738
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,430
- Let's go on our knees. - Go on your knees.

739
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,500
Let's do one at a time.

740
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,870
- Let's see. - Why are you playing?

741
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,170
There's no one else on this side.

742
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,430
- Keep going. - Don't you want to move there?

743
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,500
No, no.

744
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,330
- All right. - Why are you playing?

745
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,970
I'll actually move to that side.

746
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,270
- Are you moving here? - Yes.

747
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,130
- I'll come here. - What about Haha?

748
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,800
Move one space down.

749
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,200
You just have to pull with your right hand.

750
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,030
- Ready. - Anyone who screams first.

751
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,570
Whoever screams first will receive R Balls.

752
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,670
I don't think we should try hard.

753
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,170
- We don't have to. - Right.

754
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,370
Get ready.

755
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,500
(The game starts.)

756
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,500
Start.

757
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,670
(He throws a punch.)

758
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:26,270
(He lost his rationality due to strong pain.)

759
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,570
(Jong Kook could have peeled off his skin.)

760
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:31,000
- My gosh. - What?

761
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,800
(I only touched your sideburns. What's wrong?)

762
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,400
Jong Kook, Seok Jin screamed first.

763
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,870
- That's right. - Did he?

764
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,370
Start.

765
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,770
(Seok Jin screams.)

766
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,530
- Did he scream first? - Yes, he did.

767
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,900
- No, I didn't. It didn't hurt. - He did.

768
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,600
You did scream first, Seok Jin.

769
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,530
- I wasn't supposed to scream? - No, you weren't.

770
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,970
I have 20 left.

771
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,930
- Shall we half them, 15 each? - Shall we?

772
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,000
We will split them and each group will have 15.

773
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,400
- How can you split 20, you dummy? - One will have 15 and the other 5.

774
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,900
- He just called you dumb. - We can do 15 each.

775
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,500
- Let's give him 5. - Let's do 15 and 5.

776
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,000
(I should have held my tongue.)

777
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
- He called you dumb. - I was talking to Jae Seok.

778
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,470
(I will give you more R Balls for your courageous advice.)

779
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,500
- Thank you. - Seok Jin, you have a lot.

780
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,370
- You have four? - Prepare an extra basket for him.

781
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,000
(For 2017 Kickoff, New Year's fortune is first on the list.)

782
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,600
(This is the number of R Balls each member has.)

783
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
This is amazing.

784
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,470
- Please come in. - My gosh... This is...

785
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:21,500
The second stop on today's race is...

786
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,100
"Find Your Soulmate" which will be revealed through tarot cards.

787
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:26,730
You can discover who will be helpful to you in 2017.

788
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:30,570
You will find out about partners who will bring good luck to you.

789
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,930
You can consult the result...

790
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:35,770
when you choose your partner for the game.

791
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,500
Let me bring in an expert in this field.

792
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,000
Lee Yoon Jung will be the reader for today.

793
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,470
- Welcome. - Hello.

794
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,630
- She filmed with us before. - Right, it was last year.

795
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,770
(A reader, Lee Yoon Jung)

796
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,900
(She is a tarot master and a former president of a tarot society.)

797
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,730
Who should have the reading first?

798
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,700
- Seok Jin should. - Should I go first?

799
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,670
He gets really excited about this kind of stuff.

800
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:58,130
- It's true. I'm always curious. - He has a hard time waiting for it.

801
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,200
I see.

802
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,670
- You must've made a lot of money. - Should we sit?

803
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,670
I guess we can sit down.

804
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,500
Stop talking nonsense.

805
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,770
It's just to break the ice at first.

806
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,900
We need to get along.

807
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,900
I think he is more interested in finding out about his...

808
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,570
- personal business than his mate. - Right, he is.

809
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,100
- I will start. - Here I go.

810
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,370
(He will pick the first tarot card.)

811
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:21,670
(He has the reputation of being unlucky.)

812
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,500
Think about organic bakery.

813
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,400
One,

814
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
two...

815
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:31,870
I'm sorry, Seok Jin. Can you not throw the cards?

816
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,000
The viewers might assume you are playing poker.

817
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,900
I'm sorry. She's sitting a bit far from me.

818
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,200
- Please place the cards gently. - My apologies.

819
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,700
- I think this person goes well. - Really?

820
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,000
- Is everyone good for me? - This person may try...

821
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,970
to control you the way he or she wants.

822
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,800
- This must be Jae Seok. - This must be Jae Seok.

823
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,300
- He will be good for you. - He will?

824
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,000
He always nags me.

825
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,270
- Jae Seok. - Gosh, he's such a nagger.

826
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,830
Sometimes, I think he's older than me.

827
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:01,500
- He is your best partner. - He is?

828
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,900
I know Seok Jin really well. I am certain he's not interested in this.

829
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,270
Seok Jin, don't you want to pick cards for this year?

830
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,900
Can you read my fortune for this year?

831
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,400
- Be honest with him. - Please.

832
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,430
It is different from Korean fortune reading since it's from overseas.

833
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,500
This originated from the West.

834
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,430
People tell me that I look very western.

835
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:21,900
Where?

836
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,800
- My facial features are western. - Your facial features?

837
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,700
(He gingerly chooses his cards.)

838
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,470
- He's careful. - Yes, he is.

839
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:34,170
You saw it, right? His attitude is very different.

840
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,900
- He's picking them with two hands. - Exactly.

841
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,270
(The universe is on my side.)

842
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,900
This is good.

843
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,900
However, the only thing is that when you start something,

844
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,870
you don't finish strong.

845
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,870
(It doesn't end on a good note.)

846
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,930
(His fortune reading doesn't end on a good note.)

847
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,630
- She's being honest. - I am fine.

848
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,300
- This is scary. I have goosebumps. - So is it good or bad?

849
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,700
It's okay to maintain and keep what you have, but it's

850
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,730
- risky to start something new. - She's on point.

851
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:02,100
The reading matches completely.

852
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,130
So you are saying it's better if I just don't do anything. Right?

853
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,100
Or you can do something that will be quick.

854
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,470
- Something quick? - Right.

855
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,700
Nothing too permanent?

856
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,570
Do something that will be temporary.

857
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:13,000
You can do something like a street stall.

858
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,900
You can call it "Seok Jin's Street Stall".

859
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,900
(Seok Jin's Tarot Reading Stall?)

860
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,730
Is there any specific business you want to start?

861
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,870
- There is. - Well, I run a business.

862
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:25,800
- He wants to expand. - I see. You want to expand?

863
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:33,000
(What is Seok Jin's fortune regarding his business?)

864
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,100
You shouldn't expand.

865
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:40,100
(I shouldn't, right?)

866
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,900
It doesn't matter if it's from the East or the West.

867
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,770
- The whole world is stopping him. - The universe...

868
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:47,500
- The universe wants him to stop. - The whole world is stopping him.

869
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,600
(This is Seok Jin's compatibility with the members.)

870
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,800
Next up is Haha.

871
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,500
(Haha, a father of one child, is next.)

872
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,670
(Cards have been spread.)

873
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,670
Please choose three cards.

874
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,170
Your compatibility with this person...

875
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,300
At first, it may seem great, but as it heads to the end,

876
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,630
- it's a bit ambiguous. - Why?

877
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,470
- They don't end well. - When you actually play games...

878
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,470
with this person, the result isn't that great.

879
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,470
You are right.

880
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:13,770
Who is that?

881
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:14,770
(Who is the member he didn't accomplish much with?)

882
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,730
- It's Jae Seok. - My goodness.

883
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,770
- When we partnered up, - That applies to me, too.

884
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:21,870
- You're right. - we never won anything.

885
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,570
That's right. When I work with Haha...

886
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,870
It's either you betray me or I do.

887
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,200
He betrayed me a lot.

888
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,370
Jae Seok, you betrayed me a lot, too.

889
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,000
- You came to my house on Christmas. - Stay quiet. Stop lying.

890
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
You left me at a gas station and ran off.

891
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,840
(That was so long ago.)

892
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,000
- That happened ages ago. - Jae Seok.

893
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,470
- It's when the show just started. - Right. Jong Kook...

894
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,530
- Right, he was with me. - My goodness.

895
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,930
However, in terms of personal compatibility, it is very good.

896
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,730
- I see. - We aren't good professionally.

897
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,500
- We shouldn't play games together. - Right.

898
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,770
Now about the second person...

899
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,000
(How compatible is Haha with the second member?)

900
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,300
I think it's all or nothing with this person.

901
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,530
And I will pick on from the middle.

902
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,170
Here we go.

903
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,000
This is a bit disappointing.

904
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,770
- Didn't I pick this card before? - You are disappointed again, Haha.

905
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,630
- How can I pick the same one? - That's why...

906
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,130
- Maybe something's wrong with you. - With this person...

907
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,840
- You're the trouble. - Something's wrong with you.

908
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,870
The result leaves something to be desired.

909
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,000
But it's only professionally, right? We are good personally, right?

910
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,630
No, even personal compatibility isn't good.

911
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,170
Who is it? Is it me?

912
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,930
- No, it's Kwang Soo. - It's me?

913
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,300
We aren't compatible personally?

914
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,300
- This is weird. - It can't be.

915
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,670
- They're good together. - Something has to be changed.

916
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,700
(There needs to be a change.)

917
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,670
(He picks the cards for the third time.)

918
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,730
Why do I keep picking this card?

919
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,400
(A card keeps following Haha.)

920
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,340
I think you ought to shuffle the cards better.

921
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,800
- You're not doing it well. - Don't blame it on her.

922
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,130
Do you know how to shuffle properly?

923
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,570
She's not a poker player.

924
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,300
- This can't be right. - Haha.

925
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,300
I chose this card five times in a row.

926
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,000
- You picked it. - You are the one picking it.

927
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
- How can this be possible? - Then don't pick that one.

928
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,930
I'm going crazy. Why is this following me?

929
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,770
She isn't a gambler.

930
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,100
(As Haha wished, she shuffles the cards better.)

931
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,600
- He didn't get a compatible member. - That's right.

932
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,800
- You should shuffle a bit more. - Should I?

933
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:08,470
Then you can be a dealer and try to shuffle.

934
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,100
How can he?

935
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,000
- That's a bit much. - Why should he shuffle?

936
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,370
(He cultivates his own fortune.)

937
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:16,000
These cards are hard to shuffle.

938
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,930
I haven't seen anyone trying to shuffle the cards like a dealer.

939
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,000
It's my first time, too.

940
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,070
- Shuffling doesn't matter. - It was too disappointing.

941
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,500
(How will this one work?)

942
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,370
It's up to the person who picks the cards.

943
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,370
Jong Kook said...

944
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,800
- He has no future. - This person is better than others.

945
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,700
- It's not perfect... - But it's better than others.

946
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,370
Out of the bunch, this person is better.

947
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,000
Haha, let's try to get along.

948
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,630
Why is it him?

949
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:46,300
(Seok Jin is most compatible with Haha.)

950
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,570
It was Seok Jin.

951
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,400
She told me that my compatibility with you isn't that bad, either.

952
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,730
Haha and Seok Jin will partner up.

953
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,000
- It's a match. - It is.

954
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,000
(This is Haha's compatibility with the members.)

955
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,930
(Next is Jong Kook, the luckiest member of all.)

956
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,930
- We will start. - I will think about this person.

957
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,470
(How compatible is he with the first member he thought about?)

958
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,600
It was so hard to pick.

959
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:14,300
- This person will be challenging. - Seriously?

960
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,900
- Is that me? - You must lead this person.

961
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,130
- Is that so? I didn't expect much. - Yes.

962
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,770
It's Seok Jin.

963
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,200
- I didn't expect much. - Was that me?

964
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,800
(He's the only challenging one.)

965
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,970
This is a good result for both of you.

966
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,130
All right.

967
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,200
We are...

968
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,200
(Whispering.)

969
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,300
Of course.

970
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,900
Haha told me that fates are to be cultivated independently.

971
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,200
(Fortunes can be changed.)

972
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,230
Was that a consolation?

973
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,670
- This is too funny. - Let's cultivate ours.

974
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,570
He was so cute when he whispered.

975
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,670
- So this person isn't good for me? - Yes.

976
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,400
(How compatible is Jong Kook with the second member?)

977
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,530
- It's good this time. - Really?

978
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,770
You can be friends with this person and will be at ease.

979
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,300
Out of 100 percent, it's about 80.

980
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,800
- This is good. - Is it Ji Hyo?

981
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,570
- It's Ji Hyo. - Me?

982
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,340
This is amazing.

983
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:04,670
Really.

984
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:08,900
(How compatible is he with the third member?)

985
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,930
- It's you. - You may face troubles.

986
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:15,200
You and this person will constantly fight and struggle.

987
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,840
- It will be difficult. - How can you be so on point?

988
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,170
- It's about 40 percent. - She's accurate.

989
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,000
You are generous.

990
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,200
- She sure is generous. - Seriously.

991
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,500
She is...

992
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,600
I figured it would be more like three percent.

993
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:32,000
- I didn't expect a lot. - That's a generous score.

994
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,000
- About the last person... - One more person to go.

995
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,500
- Who's left? - Haha.

996
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,500
It's Haha.

997
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,670
(How compatible are Haha and Jong Kook?)

998
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:42,100
I don't have to be careful when it's about Haha.

999
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,900
We are like brothers.

1000
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,770
(He picks three cards randomly.)

1001
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:55,770
(From their time on "X-Man", they spent a decade together.)

1002
00:39:55,770 --> 00:40:00,000
(They showed off the best compatibility.)

1003
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,400
He chose three cards at once.

1004
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,000
The cards tell me you aren't.

1005
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,170
The cards tell me you aren't.

1006
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,340
- Shouldn't you be more careful? - I mean...

1007
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,700
Okay.

1008
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,840
(What's the score of the tarot read that put friendship in jeopardy?)

1009
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,370
- I'm sorry. - Be more cautious.

1010
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,670
What's the score?

1011
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,270
- It's zero. - Zero?

1012
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,670
You can get a zero?

1013
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,370
He didn't do it with caution. He should've drawn more carefully.

1014
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,730
- He'll go again. - You make your own fortune.

1015
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,100
Be more cautious.

1016
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,100
I feel bad for her because you got a zero.

1017
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,730
(We can have a fresh start, Haha.)

1018
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:31,530
(This is Jong Kook's compatibility with the members.)

1019
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,630
- It's Ji Hyo's turn. - Let's see how she does.

1020
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,900
(Ji Hyo is the luckiest member.)

1021
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,340
I feel like Ji Hyo will get lucky even with this.

1022
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,600
- It's me. - No, it's me.

1023
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,000
There's nothing but disappointment with this person.

1024
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,070
(There will only be disappointment.)

1025
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,130
Nothing but disappointment.

1026
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,970
It says there's no way of making it work with this person.

1027
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:53,630
I don't think this person is the right partner for you.

1028
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,470
I also feel like that with Seok Jin.

1029
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,230
They've never been good partners.

1030
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,000
- They've never been a good team. - I feel the same way.

1031
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:03,430
Why is everything related to Seok Jin sad?

1032
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,400
- It's breaking my heart. - Gosh, I'm upset.

1033
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,970
(It's heartbreaking but true.)

1034
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,840
He said I make my own fortune.

1035
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:13,600
(You make your own fortune.)

1036
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,430
- I can't believe this. - Me, neither.

1037
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:20,100
(What's Kwang Soo's compatibility with the other members?)

1038
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,340
He didn't forget to iron his coat, did he?

1039
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,230
(Gosh)

1040
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,840
I have to focus right now.

1041
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:29,470
He kind of looks like Gong Yoo when filming "Goblin".

1042
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,970
(Gong Yoo?)

1043
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:39,200
(I look like him?)

1044
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,270
(Do you mean the handsome Goblin?)

1045
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,570
(Do I look like Goblin?)

1046
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,340
Oh, it was just a hallucination.

1047
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:55,270
Oh, it was just a hallucination.

1048
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,000
I realized it was a hallucination when he turned around.

1049
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,230
(Be aware of replicas.)

1050
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,230
- It was a hallucination. - A hallucination?

1051
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:02,840
I was mistaken.

1052
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,340
- How can someone even say that? - It was a hallucination.

1053
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,470
I realized when you turned your head around.

1054
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:11,230
- You saw a hallucination. - I did.

1055
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:13,100
It was just a hallucination.

1056
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,430
This person will feel like a good partner,

1057
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:19,770
but later on, you'll feel suffocated.

1058
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,730
I'll feel suffocated?

1059
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:24,800
Is it me?

1060
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,630
I'll feel suffocated?

1061
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,400
Does it say so on the cards?

1062
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,970
- He'll feel suffocated. - I got goose bumps.

1063
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:30,970
This is great.

1064
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,670
I got goose bumps when she said I'll feel suffocated.

1065
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,070
- He'll feel suffocated. - Disappointment and suffocation.

1066
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:37,600
It'll be hard on you.

1067
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,670
But I'm so good to you.

1068
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,600
But I still feel suffocated.

1069
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,630
Being good to him suffocates him.

1070
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:47,070
(Jong Kook makes Kwang Soo feel suffocated.)

1071
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:51,200
(It's the unlucky Jae Seok.)

1072
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,840
(What is compatibility with the other members?)

1073
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,370
You can't focus on each other.

1074
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:59,270
If you decide to work together,

1075
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:02,700
your concentration will be dispersed.

1076
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,800
- But it won't be of disadvantage. - I see.

1077
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,340
You'll have to gradually build up the relationship.

1078
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,600
Is it Seok Jin or Haha?

1079
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,470
I was thinking of Jong Kook.

1080
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,840
- Me? - You have to build it up.

1081
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,840
I have to build up the relationship.

1082
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,000
The results weren't bad...

1083
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,200
- when I teamed up with Jong Kook. - That's true.

1084
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,270
What score would you give it?

1085
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:23,630
- About 70. - That's pretty high.

1086
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,730
- That's high. - It's 70 and 40.

1087
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
It's 110 in total then.

1088
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,770
- That's way too high. - This doesn't make sense.

1089
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:32,730
- Why was it so high? - You must have a crush on me.

1090
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:33,800
You wish.

1091
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,530
- I guess so. - Were you secretly in love with me?

1092
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:40,130
- I guess I liked you more. - I guess so.

1093
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:42,700
- You scored 70. - That's way too high.

1094
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,970
- My score was 40. - Really?

1095
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,970
Is it better to get a lower score in this game?

1096
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:51,570
(Jae Seok has a crush on Jong Kook.)

1097
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:56,700
(Running Man's level of affection)

1098
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,600
You can now partner up...

1099
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,230
according to the partnership level.

1100
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:02,900
I'll team up with Seok Jin.

1101
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,500
- I have Haha. - That'll be for the best.

1102
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,730
- We'll have each other. - Let's do this, Seok Jin.

1103
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,130
We're the remaining three.

1104
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:12,130
I scored 100 with Kwang Soo. The score with Ji Hyo isn't too bad.

1105
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,730
I have Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo.

1106
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:16,330
- You can team up with Jong Kook. - I have Jong Kook, too.

1107
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:19,000
Jae Seok and Kwang Soo will be a team.

1108
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,070
Let's do this.

1109
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:21,970
- Let's show them what we've got. - Let's do this.

1110
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:24,000
- Let's see if we can overcome fate. - Let's go.

1111
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,670
- We have to overcome it. - That's right.

1112
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,430
All right. This game is called "Press and Hide".

1113
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:31,500
(Press and Hide)

1114
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,730
The teams will take turns being the tagger.

1115
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:38,400
After you ring the bell, you have to catch the others.

1116
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:40,630
You can get them out just by touching them.

1117
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:43,370
- You will play here in this room. - Okay.

1118
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:46,870
The two people will ring the bell and come back inside.

1119
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:49,100
(Is this what the game was about?)

1120
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,730
You should've explained the game before we could draw.

1121
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:54,200
(This is also your fate.)

1122
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,400
What difference did it make?

1123
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,630
(We're ready to begin the game.)

1124
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:04,670
- Let's catch them all. - Okay.

1125
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:06,170
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo are the taggers for Round One.)

1126
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,430
Your pants are too big. You should get them tailored.

1127
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:10,500
This is how you wear these.

1128
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,370
- Kwang Soo. - The game didn't even start yet.

1129
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:15,400
I'll go to the cleaner's and tighten them for you.

1130
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:17,670
- You're supposed to wear these big. - Really?

1131
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,570
Do we go together to ring the bell?

1132
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:21,430
Or can one person do it?

1133
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,370
We can gather here and make a run for it later.

1134
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,000
You should be gathered over there.

1135
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,900
But it'll be over if they come at us from both directions.

1136
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,430
- No. - We'll start once we verify it.

1137
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,600
Should we ring the bell?

1138
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:37,230
(I'll do it.)

1139
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:41,130
(You can count on me.)

1140
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:45,100
(Why is Seok Jin so confident?)

1141
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,070
(What is Seok Jin's strategy that makes him so confident?)

1142
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:51,330
Press it.

1143
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,730
(Let's go, Seok Jin.)

1144
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,100
(I'm so nervous.)

1145
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:04,100
(Everyone is ready to play Press and Hide.)

1146
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,600
- It started. - Let's go.

1147
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:11,600
(Ringing)

1148
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,670
Let's go, Kwang Soo.

1149
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,970
(Press and Hide has been started.)

1150
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:18,770
Let's go, Kwang Soo. Let's go.

1151
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:25,400
Let's go, Kwang Soo. Let's go.

1152
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,130
(What kind of bad strategy is this?)

1153
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:29,170
Gosh.

1154
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:32,330
- Seok Jin is out. - They caught me. Why weren't you...

1155
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:34,770
Seok Jin is out.

1156
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:36,900
They caught me. Why weren't you...

1157
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,900
(Caught you.)

1158
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,070
Ji Hyo is over here.

1159
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,070
(Let's get Ji Hyo.)

1160
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,870
Ji Hyo is over here.

1161
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,000
Ji Hyo is over here.

1162
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:49,670
(Kwang Soo joins the chase.)

1163
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:50,770
Song Ji Hyo!

1164
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:52,970
- Song Ji Hyo! - I touched you.

1165
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:54,770
Ji Hyo is out.

1166
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,470
I touched you!

1167
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:58,930
(Is something there?)

1168
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:00,100
Did you touch someone?

1169
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,300
- No. - Where are they?

1170
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,730
(There was something here.)

1171
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:06,670
I touched Haha!

1172
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,970
He was hiding there?

1173
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:09,670
- Where's Jong Kook? - He's not here.

1174
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:11,130
- There's only one left. - Jong Kook's the only one left.

1175
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,870
- Kim Jong Kook. - We only have to catch Jong Kook.

1176
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:15,470
Jong Kook, you have to hold out for long.

1177
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,570
(Jong Kook is hiding.)

1178
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:20,400
- Kim Jong Kook! - Where did he go?

1179
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,170
Where did you go, Jong Kook?

1180
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:24,470
He hid very well.

1181
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:26,430
(The whereabouts of a muscular man)

1182
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:27,600
(A muscular man has gone missing.)

1183
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,830
You have to hold them out.

1184
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:32,500
He hid so well.

1185
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:34,200
They're never going to find him.

1186
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,870
Tell the cameramen to shoot him.

1187
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:41,430
(Kwang Soo is on a chase for a missing man.)

1188
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:42,530
He's not here.

1189
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,400
- He's over here! - Where is he?

1190
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:51,300
(Did they finally find Jong Kook?)

1191
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:55,070
Gosh, that scared me. What is that?

1192
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,300
I got really scared.

1193
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,170
- What is that? - I thought his head was floating.

1194
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:03,130
- Find Jong Kook. - His head was floating in the air.

1195
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,730
(He thought something horrible happened.)

1196
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:06,000
Where did he go?

1197
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,730
- He hid so well. - Where is he hiding?

1198
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:10,670
Jong Kook sure is good.

1199
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:11,970
(Where on earth is he?)

1200
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:15,000
(He's gone missing in the small studio.)

1201
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,200
How are we...

1202
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:19,370
Where is he hiding?

1203
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,400
He vanished.

1204
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,800
- Is he hanging from the ceiling? - Over here!

1205
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,330
- He's over here! - Where is he?

1206
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:26,470
Where is he hiding?

1207
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,900
(Detective Yu wandered around for a long time.)

1208
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:34,230
- Is he hanging from the ceiling? - Over here!

1209
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:35,470
- He's over here! - Where is he?

1210
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:37,830
- Why are you filming me? - He's over here.

1211
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:39,600
- I found him. - What are you doing right now?

1212
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,670
- How did you find him? - You can't be filming me.

1213
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,600
- That was amazing. - It really was.

1214
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,800
- We didn't know until now. - We really didn't know.

1215
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:49,430
They were never going to find me.

1216
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:55,300
(Seok Jin and Haha are the taggers for Round Two.)

1217
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,770
Let's show them that we're different.

1218
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:59,370
With your power and my speed.

1219
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,300
Don't you think I can fit in there?

1220
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,200
- How are you going to fit in there? - You don't think I can?

1221
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,800
- You can't fit in there. - Let me try.

1222
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,970
(What kind of a plan is this?)

1223
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:12,000
Even Mr. Barrel wouldn't be able to fit here.

1224
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:14,600
I think I can fit in here.

1225
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,470
- In here? - Don't you think so?

1226
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:18,570
It'll be easy.

1227
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:22,500
They caught me so easily. Why did he look aside while running?

1228
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,600
There's no reason for him to look there.

1229
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,130
The fact that he looked over here is absurd.

1230
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,730
People would usually just run past it.

1231
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,170
- What's Jae Seok doing? - What are you doing?

1232
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,500
(What a bad timing.)

1233
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,200
- What? - Why would you open the door?

1234
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,530
Why would you open our door?

1235
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,870
You won't have time for that. The game starts at the bell.

1236
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,900
(Jae Seok's plan has failed.)

1237
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,400
- I'll run and... - What are you trying to do?

1238
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,430
I'll run and...

1239
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,830
This is good.

1240
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,470
The eggs keep coming out of there.

1241
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:53,100
(He's planning on getting vacuum sealed as the bell goes off.)

1242
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:56,000
- This won't be easy. - This game is not about being fast.

1243
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,370
This is about finding them. It's not about being fast.

1244
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:00,970
- Don't you think so? - We have to find them quickly.

1245
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,800
We have to be really quick.

1246
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,970
(What will Jae Seok's power and Haha's speed bring?)

1247
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:08,770
(Ji Hyo will be the one pressing the bell this time.)

1248
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,170
(The game will start any time now.)

1249
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,870
(The fast team will distribute 50R.)

1250
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:15,300
We have to do it very fast.

1251
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,000
(The fast team will distribute 50R.)

1252
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,200
(The doorbell rings.)

1253
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,270
We were too busy talking.

1254
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,530
(The game has begun.)

1255
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:23,600
Hey.

1256
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:27,200
- That's not the way. - Where did you go?

1257
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:29,170
(Is anyone next to the door?)

1258
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:31,900
Where did he go?

1259
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:35,000
(Before getting vacuum sealed...)

1260
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,930
- Here he is. - Catch him.

1261
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:38,900
(Seok Jin spots Jong Kook.)

1262
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,430
(Seok Jin runs very fast.)

1263
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,500
He's over here. Attack him on the other side, Haha.

1264
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,070
- Hey. - Where is he?

1265
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:47,500
(Why can't she catch him?)

1266
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,570
Wait, I'm getting close.

1267
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:50,700
(She isn't close to catching him.)

1268
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:52,970
There's Jae Seok.

1269
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:57,330
(Haha succeeds in spotting Jae Seok.)

1270
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:01,830
(Jae Seok is completely trapped.)

1271
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:02,900
I touched you.

1272
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:07,130
How did you get in so quickly?

1273
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:09,630
(On the other hand...)

1274
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,230
This is frustrating.

1275
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,470
(Seok Jin struggles...)

1276
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:13,630
I can't catch her.

1277
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:15,830
(Seok Jin struggles to catch Ji Hyo.)

1278
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:17,170
Haha.

1279
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:18,930
Why can't you catch her?

1280
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:20,000
(He's running out of breath.)

1281
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,770
Why can't you catch her?

1282
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:23,070
(She giggles.)

1283
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:25,570
(Are they playing tag or simply going in circles?)

1284
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:26,630
Ji Hyo!

1285
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,130
(Haha joins.)

1286
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:33,200
(Haha starts running to catch Ji Hyo.)

1287
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:37,000
- I got you. - Where's Jong Kook?

1288
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,400
- Who did it? - Jae Seok is out.

1289
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,500
Ji Hyo is also out.

1290
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,270
- Only two members remain. - I tried my best.

1291
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,100
There you are. I touched you.

1292
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:52,770
- There you are. I touched you. - He touched you.

1293
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:54,370
We only have one member left.

1294
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:55,500
Jong Kook.

1295
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,430
(Only Jong Kook remains.)

1296
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:59,170
Jong Kook, keep hiding.

1297
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:00,870
Hide well, Jong Kook.

1298
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:03,430
- We're quite quick. - Keep hiding.

1299
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:04,970
He was behind the curtain.

1300
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:06,570
Actually, we didn't have to hide.

1301
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:08,370
We just needed Jong Kook to hide.

1302
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:10,070
Isn't it impossible to find him?

1303
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:11,400
He disappeared.

1304
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,670
The time keeps ticking.

1305
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:15,770
- Where is he? - Take a break. We can't find him.

1306
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:17,700
Where is he hiding?

1307
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,430
He's the biggest one, but where is he?

1308
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:25,370
Where could he be? I saw him at the beginning.

1309
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:27,600
Is he hanging from the ceiling?

1310
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,570
- Isn't this team running last? - No, we aren't.

1311
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,730
(Where could Jong Kook be in this small studio?)

1312
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:34,970
Where is he?

1313
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:36,570
(Where could Jong Kook be in this small studio?)

1314
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,100
He disappeared.

1315
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:40,170
Where did he go?

1316
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:43,930
Seok Jin keeps repeating himself.

1317
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:45,500
He's stating the obvious.

1318
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,730
- Did you check there? - Is he here?

1319
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:53,300
- Is he there? - I found him!

1320
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:54,470
- Where? - He's over here.

1321
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,930
- Where? - He's over here.

1322
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:57,570
Seok Jin.

1323
00:52:57,670 --> 00:53:00,830
Seok Jin. Corner him.

1324
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:03,070
(They finally found their long lost brother.)

1325
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:05,770
Let's corner him. He's going that way.

1326
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:07,970
Gosh.

1327
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:09,070
(Shy Jong Kook finally appears.)

1328
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:11,330
- Where is he? - Catch him. He's over there.

1329
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:14,170
I touched you.

1330
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,530
We finally caught him.

1331
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:17,200
(Jong Kook is out.)

1332
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,470
Where was he hiding?

1333
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:20,470
- When did he go there? - He was hiding over here.

1334
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:22,100
I definitely saw him around here.

1335
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:23,630
This is great.

1336
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,170
(Round Two of "Press and Hide" ends.)

1337
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,400
We're doing well.

1338
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,170
You played an important role.

1339
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,100
Shall we go in quickly?

1340
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:32,970
Let's catch whoever we see first.

1341
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,470
Let's divide the area.

1342
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:36,430
- You can take this side. - Me?

1343
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:38,870
- I'll take this side. - I'll take the other side.

1344
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:42,670
Kwang Soo might be in disguise this time.

1345
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,670
The doorbell sounds funny.

1346
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,830
- He's too fast. - No, I'm not.

1347
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:50,100
He's not too fast.

1348
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,470
(He's very nervous.)

1349
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,730
Coincidentally, we're on the same team.

1350
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:00,970
They're done for.

1351
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:06,070
("Press and Hide" starts.)

1352
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:09,700
(Run away, they're coming.)

1353
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:16,700
(Ji Hyo and Jong Kook take off to catch the others.)

1354
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:22,900
(Seok Jin is found as soon as the game starts.)

1355
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:27,330
(He runs away with all his might, but he's not strong enough.)

1356
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,600
Seok Jin is out.

1357
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,500
(Seok Jin is out.)

1358
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,700
(Where is everyone?)

1359
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:36,300
There he is.

1360
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,070
(He gets punched.)

1361
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:41,800
(Kwang Soo is also out.)

1362
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,000
- I just caught Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo is out.

1363
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:46,630
- This is so embarrassing. - Did you catch him?

1364
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,370
Who else is there?

1365
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:51,370
- Haha? - There's Jae Seok and Haha.

1366
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:52,530
You're doing well.

1367
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:54,070
(Ji Hyo climbs up to look far.)

1368
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:56,800
It couldn't have been easy to run and hide so quickly.

1369
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:01,100
(He's dying to catch them.)

1370
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,670
- He's good at hiding. - He hid himself well.

1371
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:06,170
People are getting better at hiding after trying it a few times.

1372
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,670
(They're as good as ninjas.)

1373
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:09,900
- Jong Kook, did you check there? - Where?

1374
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:13,730
- Where? - It's where staff members are.

1375
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:17,000
Over here? Let me see.

1376
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:19,770
Get out.

1377
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:20,800
(He found him.)

1378
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,600
- Isn't he over there? - You're embarrassing me.

1379
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:26,300
Jae Seok is out.

1380
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,730
- I have to find Haha. - Only Haha remains.

1381
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:32,930
- I must find Haha. - He hid himself well.

1382
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:34,930
- You did quite well though. - Didn't I?

1383
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:37,900
- You have a good chance to win. - Haha can't go up high.

1384
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:40,130
- Where is Haha hiding? - Where is he?

1385
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:42,270
What if he keeps hiding until the shooting ends?

1386
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:43,700
(Haha is excellent at hiding.)

1387
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:44,770
I haven't seen him.

1388
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:46,830
He might not come out until the award ceremony.

1389
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:48,300
He might be at a dangerous place.

1390
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:50,470
I haven't seen him. Where did he go?

1391
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:51,530
(Did Haha become part of an object?)

1392
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:53,170
I don't think he went this way.

1393
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:55,930
- What if he went home? - Did he run and hide?

1394
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:57,770
I haven't seen Haha, either.

1395
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,530
- He's not here. - He isn't.

1396
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:02,630
Why am I looking for him?

1397
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,930
I was just curious.

1398
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:05,630
(She peeks behind.)

1399
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:07,200
Did you check on this side, Ji Hyo?

1400
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,770
(Did he rise up to the ceiling or go down to the ground?)

1401
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:12,870
He did something with his clothes.

1402
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,430
Buy time.

1403
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:18,500
(Try to find where Haha is.)

1404
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:24,400
(We'll play it one more time.)

1405
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,400
(Haha is here.)

1406
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:28,000
(He pretends to be with the sound crew.)

1407
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,070
I'm sure hiding places are limited.

1408
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,730
- Do you mean Haha? - Yes.

1409
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:34,800
(Ji Hyo comes back to the studio.)

1410
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,330
- Do you mean Haha? - Yes.

1411
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:37,470
(She looks around the sound crew.)

1412
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:39,170
- Where did he go? - Did you check this side?

1413
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:41,530
- Where did he go? - Did you check this side?

1414
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:43,230
No, I didn't.

1415
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:48,400
- Did you check this side? - No, I didn't.

1416
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,970
Where did he go?

1417
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:51,830
(Haha is at risk.)

1418
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:55,300
(She approaches very close to where he is.)

1419
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,870
I can't find him at all.

1420
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,670
I can't find him at all.

1421
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,770
It's slowly getting scary.

1422
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:04,900
(Jae Seok spots Haha.)

1423
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,570
In the beginning...

1424
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,700
Why aren't you filming him? You filmed me when I was hiding.

1425
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:12,800
You should film him by now.

1426
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,430
- That's right. - Film him like how you filmed me.

1427
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:17,170
(He's being filmed.)

1428
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,470
Really? You're filming him?

1429
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:22,730
I can't see anyone filming him, though.

1430
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:25,000
Where on earth is he?

1431
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,000
Where are people filming him?

1432
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,230
(Others start to spot Haha.)

1433
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:29,730
- Where are people filming him? - He won.

1434
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:32,300
He's in complete disguise.

1435
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:34,270
I found him.

1436
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,000
Where are people filming him?

1437
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:38,570
You won't find him.

1438
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,000
Where did Haha go?

1439
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,800
I can see that he's being filmed, Jong Kook.

1440
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:45,000
- Is someone filming him? - Time is ticking.

1441
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,370
- He's in complete disguise. - I see where he is.

1442
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,900
Jong Kook is very upset.

1443
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,370
(I'll take care of you now.)

1444
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:54,800
(Run for your life.)

1445
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,870
(Ji Hyo touches him.)

1446
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:58,370
- He was standing there. - That was great.

1447
00:57:58,370 --> 00:57:59,430
(Haha is out.)

1448
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:02,370
Here are the results of "Press and Hide".

1449
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:06,130
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo took 4 minutes 30 seconds.

1450
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:08,900
- We took a long time. - They're running last.

1451
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:12,730
Haha and Seok Jin took 2 minutes 55 seconds.

1452
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:14,170
We don't know who's winning yet.

1453
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:17,430
Jae Seok and Kwang Soo...

1454
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:18,630
(What about Jae Seok and Kwang Soo?)

1455
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:19,670
Three minutes?

1456
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,400
They took 1 minute 41 seconds.

1457
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,470
(They're the winners.)

1458
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:23,730
- Therefore, - Did they win?

1459
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:27,800
we'll give 50 R Balls to Jae Seok and Kwang Soo.

1460
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,930
Thank you.

1461
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:30,170
Gosh, thank you.

1462
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,900
- Let's share one by one. - Okay.

1463
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,200
Each can take 10 balls.

1464
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:34,770
Take out your basket.

1465
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:35,870
(Try taking 10 balls.)

1466
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:38,170
- That's too many. - We should hurry.

1467
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:40,400
- I have a lot. - Okay.

1468
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:42,470
Be careful, Kwang Soo. Take them to the others.

1469
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,170
There's no rule. They give out however many they want.

1470
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:48,470
It's like shopping at a market on the street.

1471
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:50,430
We have a lot of love.

1472
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:52,200
Here are some for Seok Jin.

1473
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,070
What are you doing?

1474
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:55,630
You don't have to give me many.

1475
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,900
You already gave me a lot.

1476
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,000
- That's good enough. - It's more even now.

1477
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,730
(These are the numbers of R Balls each member has.)

1478
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:05,370
(Running Man's New Year's fortune)

1479
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:07,400
(Running Man's physical checkup)

1480
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,000
- What's this? - Please come in.

1481
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,370
Welcome.

1482
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:12,370
- What's going on here? - Please come in.

1483
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:13,930
There's a lot to listen today.

1484
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:15,900
Seok Jin didn't hear anything good today.

1485
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:17,670
- It's driving me crazy. - Now that it's the new year...

1486
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:19,870
I even thought about changing my career.

1487
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:22,330
Seok Jin is under a lot of stress.

1488
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,700
This is the second part of Running Man's New Year.

1489
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:28,230
For the new year, you can't ever emphasize enough about...

1490
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:30,270
- health. - Health is the most important.

1491
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,570
We'd like to take responsibility of your health.

1492
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:34,230
Isn't iridodiagnosis accurate?

1493
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:36,800
Isn't iridodiagnosis accurate? I've gotten one before.

1494
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,070
- Really? - The diagnosis is so accurate.

1495
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:40,700
I have the result attached on my fridge.

1496
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,730
- Is it accurate? - Yes.

1497
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,370
We'll rank you by your state of health.

1498
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,670
Won't Jong Kook rank first?

1499
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:48,270
It may be different from what you see.

1500
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:50,530
We can't be sure about our health.

1501
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,400
We'll invite him right away.

1502
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,600
- Please welcome Dr. Park Sung Il. - Welcome!

1503
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,730
(He has spared time today for the Running Man members.)

1504
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,600
He's here to examine our health.

1505
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,630
- Hello. - Hello.

1506
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,930
(Park Sung Il, Korean medicine doctor)

1507
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:05,300
We've never done this before.

1508
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,000
I'm nervous about it.

1509
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
- Me, too. - Iridodiagnosis can...

1510
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:13,230
figure out your strengths and weaknesses.

1511
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:15,870
It tells you how healthy you are.

1512
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:18,530
It can predict your past diseases as well as diseases that you may face.

1513
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:21,400
- Diseases we might have? - It's possible to predict them.

1514
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,870
- Can we try? - Of course.

1515
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:24,430
I never knew such a thing existed.

1516
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:27,000
- I'm so curious. - You already took the photo...

1517
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,330
- of your iris. It will be good... - I see.

1518
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,800
if I can explain while we see them together.

1519
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,830
- It will be good if you listen... - The iris looks so exhausted.

1520
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,630
The iris looks so exhausted. Whose is it?

1521
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:39,130
Why don't you guess whose it is?

1522
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:40,230
I'm not sure.

1523
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:41,770
- It's Ji Hyo's. - I think it's Ji Hyo's.

1524
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:44,130
- It looks like a lady's eye. - It doesn't look good.

1525
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:46,130
- I don't know whose it is, but... - Ji Hyo has a lot of eye lashes.

1526
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:47,170
The color looks a bit murky.

1527
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:48,170
(If it's murky...)

1528
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:49,670
- This has to be Seok Jin's. - It's Seok Jin's.

1529
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:52,330
(The murky eye is Seok Jin's eye.)

1530
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:54,000
- Is it mine? - Yes.

1531
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,330
- It's too murky. - Seok Jin.

1532
01:00:55,330 --> 01:00:57,500
- It sure is murky. - It is Seok Jin's.

1533
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,970
When you look at his eyes, sometimes they look a bit hazy.

1534
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:02,430
As you see, the surface of his iris...

1535
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,600
isn't smooth like marble.

1536
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:07,130
Right? What do you see in the upper part of his iris?

1537
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:09,330
(The upper part of his iris is especially hazy.)

1538
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:11,530
- It's gray. - It's not clear.

1539
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:13,730
Couldn't it because I am a bit westernized?

1540
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,430
Your brain has already started to age.

1541
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:18,400
(Getting into the point right away)

1542
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,400
(Has he gotten old already?)

1543
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,500
- No way. - This can't be true.

1544
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,070
- My brain? - Yes.

1545
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:25,700
- How's your memory lately? - My gosh.

1546
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,430
- My memory? - He can't distinguish faces.

1547
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,230
Your memory will start to deteriorate.

1548
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:34,000
This part shows your stomach condition.

1549
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,230
Do you see how there's a tear here?

1550
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:38,330
It shows your stomach condition isn't well.

1551
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:39,670
Not long ago, I started...

1552
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:42,000
- taking pills for my stomach. - You said your stomach was...

1553
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,270
Can you tell him at least one good news? Please.

1554
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:45,430
Just one.

1555
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:47,000
- Fortune reading didn't go well. - Please.

1556
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,970
I am about to pass out.

1557
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,700
You can be careful in the future.

1558
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:54,000
(Seok Jin's physical condition)

1559
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
(New Year's advice is to improve eating habits and exercise muscles.)

1560
01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:00,230
- Next up is Jae Seok's eye. - It's mine?

1561
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:02,730
I like this kind of people.

1562
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:04,300
The reason is...

1563
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:08,000
I usually say that people with this kind of eyes have a sexy brain.

1564
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,530
- A sexy brain? - He has a sexy brain?

1565
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:12,230
- It means he is smart... - He must have dirty thoughts.

1566
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:14,170
(He's the man who only thinks of dirty thoughts.)

1567
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:16,370
His brain is filled with adult videos.

1568
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:20,200
Let's look at his left eye.

1569
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:22,000
His stomach isn't good.

1570
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:25,000
- It isn't? - He can't digest well.

1571
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:27,870
You need to be careful of what you eat and your environment.

1572
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:30,000
- I see. - Live in a good environment.

1573
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,730
A good environment? I will eat some delicious food.

1574
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,670
Please understand if I eat delicious food alone.

1575
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:38,470
- Alone? - We can eat it together.

1576
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:40,630
- You should think about us, too. - Okay, okay.

1577
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:43,530
- Let's eat together. - Of course.

1578
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:45,870
Can we look at his right eye one more time?

1579
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:48,230
- The right eye? - The upper part is gray, too.

1580
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:50,070
This is actually a shadow.

1581
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:52,000
(He's firm.)

1582
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:53,530
(Mine is aging process and his is shadow?)

1583
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:54,530
This can't be right.

1584
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:57,400
- How can it be... - He said that's a shadow.

1585
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,430
(They accuse him of favoring Jae Seok.)

1586
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:01,530
- Are you sure it's a shadow? - Let's look at mine.

1587
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:03,700
- Can we look at mine again? - Here you go.

1588
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:05,200
Look. This isn't a shadow.

1589
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,400
How are they different? His eye is grayer.

1590
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,530
- Yours is certainly gray. - This is crazy.

1591
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:13,000
(Seok Jin's eye is hazy while Jae Seok's eye is clear.)

1592
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,430
It's a shadow of his eyelid.

1593
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:15,800
It's a shadow of his eyelid?

1594
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,900
(Jae Seok's physical condition)

1595
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,700
(New Year's advice is to enjoy working in a good environment.)

1596
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,200
Guess whose eye this is.

1597
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:25,070
This eye looks healthy.

1598
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:30,330
- It's smooth as marble. - It's smooth. It's Ji Hyo's.

1599
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:33,730
It means this person is full of energy. Energy is like a fire.

1600
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,830
- This person has a fire inside. - It's Jong Kook.

1601
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:37,130
To whom does it belong?

1602
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:38,800
- This person is too energetic. - It has to be one of them.

1603
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:41,770
This person won't die even if he or she doesn't eat for 10 days.

1604
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:42,930
It's Jong Kook.

1605
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
This person recovers quickly even after a surgery.

1606
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,430
It's Jong Kook.

1607
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:49,430
- I do recover fast. - Isn't he a cyborg?

1608
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:50,430
It's Jong Kook's eye.

1609
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:51,430
(It's Jong Kook's iris.)

1610
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:54,430
You are lucky to have parents like yours.

1611
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:58,170
You're born to be healthy. It's thanks to your parents.

1612
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:03,400
Men with this kind of healthy condition was considered to be...

1613
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,900
the best in times of war...

1614
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:09,170
during the 16th and 17th centuries.

1615
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:10,630
(He must have been preferred in war times.)

1616
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:12,430
He should have been born during the Roman Era.

1617
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:14,200
If we were in war,

1618
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,270
- we would all be killed by him. - Right.

1619
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:19,000
- We'd all be dead. - That's right.

1620
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,770
(Even his iris is manly.)

1621
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:22,970
(Jong Kook's physical condition)

1622
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:25,970
(New Year's advice is to exercise as much as he did last year.)

1623
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:28,900
- Let's look at the next eye. - Shall we?

1624
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,830
This is Haha's.

1625
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,930
You should notice...

1626
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:36,530
that the upper part is brown,

1627
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:38,170
but the lower part is brighter.

1628
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:39,230
That's right.

1629
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:40,870
- Isn't it? - It is.

1630
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:44,000
This is related to his spine and bones.

1631
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,500
(How did he know?)

1632
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:50,430
Next, urogenital organs will start to weaken.

1633
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:52,170
The same thing showed up in his fortune reading.

1634
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:54,500
That's why...

1635
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,530
(He's in shock.)

1636
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:57,600
- You need to make children quickly. - He has no time.

1637
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,730
He won't be able to later.

1638
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:00,170
(You can also predict that from my iris?)

1639
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:04,330
You should try to strengthen your lower body and your waist.

1640
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:07,330
- You should walk a lot. - Walk?

1641
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,600
Go for a walk by yourself.

1642
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:13,000
I can see some gray parts in the bottom. Why is that?

1643
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,830
This is because...

1644
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:16,930
you often drink a lot.

1645
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:18,570
- He does drink a lot. - Why is...

1646
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:21,900
Why do you say mine shows aging process...

1647
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
and his is caused by drinking?

1648
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,130
(You need to accept the reality, Seok Jin.)

1649
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:28,230
- He's really hurt. - There's a slight difference.

1650
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:30,170
- I'm disappointed. - Don't be.

1651
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:32,530
- He's telling you what he sees. - Everyone's eyes are gray.

1652
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:34,430
Let me continue.

1653
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:38,870
On the left, I can see that you have a hole in your lung.

1654
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:40,730
You have a hole in your lung.

1655
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:42,130
(He's surprised.)

1656
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:44,730
There's a chance you may get lung cancer.

1657
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:46,330
His lung isn't in a good condition in fact.

1658
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:48,830
- You must stop smoking completely. - You should go to the hospital.

1659
01:05:48,830 --> 01:05:50,900
(He is shocked.)

1660
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,330
You really should quit smoking.

1661
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:54,000
Then everyone else can smoke?

1662
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,730
No one should smoke.

1663
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:57,330
(He's frustrated.)

1664
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,430
Please just don't do anything.

1665
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:01,830
Don't smoke or do anything.

1666
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:02,830
(You should've stayed quiet.)

1667
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:04,070
Just keep quiet.

1668
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:06,230
(Haha's physical condition)

1669
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:09,330
(New Year's advice is to stay away from cold food and exercise.)

1670
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:11,600
- Who's next? - Shall we see the next one?

1671
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,700
- It's pretty. - What a clear eye. It's Ji Hyo's.

1672
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,170
- It has to be a lady's eye. - It's mine.

1673
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:17,170
(Unlike previous eyes, it is clear and pure.)

1674
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:19,330
Her eyes are pretty just like her face.

1675
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:21,370
It's Ji Hyo's eye.

1676
01:06:21,930 --> 01:06:24,170
But don't you see...

1677
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:25,630
some parts are cracked?

1678
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:27,000
- That's true. - There are.

1679
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,170
Her stomach is weak.

1680
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:31,530
It's because she's stressed out and it affects her stomach.

1681
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:34,270
Because there are a lot of parts cracked,

1682
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:37,200
you should avoid stress and spicy or salty food.

1683
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:42,700
There are small holes on the edge.

1684
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:46,730
Your immune system for throat and lymph nodes are weak.

1685
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:49,000
- I get sore throat often. - She does.

1686
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,630
Your immune system is weak.

1687
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:52,430
- This is amazing. - Your throat is weak.

1688
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:54,270
- You can find out everything. - So...

1689
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:56,970
the best medicine for you is...

1690
01:06:56,970 --> 01:06:58,700
Since you are very active,

1691
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:00,870
sleeping is the best medicine.

1692
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:02,430
That's why I sleep a lot.

1693
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:04,430
- She does. - She really sleeps a lot.

1694
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:07,830
She sleeps when she's tired. So you shouldn't wake her up.

1695
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,870
After you sleep, you don't feel the need to eat.

1696
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:11,530
- She sleeps without eating. - She doesn't eat.

1697
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:14,730
It's better for her to sleep well instead of...

1698
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:17,170
eating and not sleeping.

1699
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:18,430
There was a reason.

1700
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:20,700
- That's right. - Sleep is good for Ji Hyo.

1701
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:24,530
Her body is trying to get what's most needed.

1702
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:26,170
- Take care of your lymph nodes. - I will.

1703
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,770
(Ji Hyo's physical condition)

1704
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:31,630
(New Year's advice is to sleep well.)

1705
01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:34,470
- Next is the last eye. - It's Kwang Soo's.

1706
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:36,730
- His eye is... - What is this?

1707
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:38,630
- It's too gray. - I'm wearing contact lenses.

1708
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:39,830
- It's because of the lenses. - My gosh.

1709
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:42,600
- I can see he drinks a lot. - It's because of the lenses.

1710
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,900
Isn't this an eye of fish?

1711
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,230
(It does look similar.)

1712
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:47,430
Isn't this an eye of fish?

1713
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:48,830
How could you say that?

1714
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:50,500
(He's angry.)

1715
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,100
What's the black thing at the bottom?

1716
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:54,330
Does it have to do with his heart?

1717
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:55,630
It's like a dot.

1718
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:57,870
- It relates to his liver. - His liver isn't good.

1719
01:07:57,870 --> 01:08:00,530
You can't eat junk food.

1720
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:03,000
- This is amazing. - When you see the iris,

1721
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,400
you have sensitive intestines. That's why you don't gain weight.

1722
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,600
You have weak intestines.

1723
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:09,270
Your lung, respiratory system, and intestines are weak.

1724
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,900
You have hormone imbalance in your brain.

1725
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:13,430
My condition is just terrible.

1726
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:16,900
You need to work on your muscles and you must do cardio exercises.

1727
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:20,000
Is that it for me? Is there anything good about me?

1728
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,170
Please find one.

1729
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:22,700
You are worse than me.

1730
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:25,000
(Something good?)

1731
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,970
(Like my waist or my lower body?)

1732
01:08:28,330 --> 01:08:30,830
Let's give a round of applause to the doctor.

1733
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:33,170
(I am not done yet.)

1734
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:35,070
- Thank you. - This was interesting.

1735
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:36,600
Thank you so much.

1736
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,430
- Thank you, Doctor. - Thank you.

1737
01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:39,430
(All I remember is the eye of fish.)

1738
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:41,270
(Kwang Soo's physical condition)

1739
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:44,000
(New Year's advice is to cut back junk food and improve muscles.)

1740
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,230
- Thank you. - This was amazing.

1741
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:46,600
It's quite convincing.

1742
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,530
- It's so interesting. - The iris...

1743
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,100
We will reveal the ranks...

1744
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:52,640
of your iris conditions.

1745
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,300
- Not this again. - We've graded the results.

1746
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:59,870
Whoever is ranked last...

1747
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:02,330
will receive herbal medicine...

1748
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,530
and a chance to distribute R Balls.

1749
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:06,870
- It's good to be ranked last. - Whoever is last can...

1750
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:08,100
It's to comfort that person.

1751
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:10,140
Who knew I would be competing with Seok Jin?

1752
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:12,070
I will announce the first place.

1753
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:13,430
- It's the best. - The first place...

1754
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:16,070
(Who will get the first place and have a healthy start?)

1755
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:19,700
(Even his DNA is capable.)

1756
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:22,230
(Is it the manliest member, Jong Kook?)

1757
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:25,330
(Even his brain is intelligent.)

1758
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:28,870
(Is it Jae Seok, a man of talents that the 21st century seeks for?)

1759
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:29,870
The first place...

1760
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,140
goes to Kim Jong Kook.

1761
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:33,000
(Everyone expected him to take the first place.)

1762
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,230
- I'm jealous. - Congratulations.

1763
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:36,830
- It's as expected. - I will try to be healthier.

1764
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:39,640
- The second place goes to... - Jae Seok?

1765
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:40,640
It goes to Yu Jae Seok.

1766
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,770
- Thank you. - These two exercise the most.

1767
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:45,140
The ranking is proportionate to the exercises we do.

1768
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:47,830
- I will announce the third place. - It's Ji Hyo.

1769
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:49,000
It's Song Ji Hyo.

1770
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,430
(She's satisfied with the result.)

1771
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:52,230
- My goodness. - Now we have...

1772
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,230
It's us three.

1773
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:54,640
- Now we will... - We all drink a lot.

1774
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,330
We will announce the fourth place. It goes to...

1775
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:59,230
(The first nominee is Seok Jin whose brain started to age.)

1776
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:02,870
(The second nominee is Haha whose manhood is at risk.)

1777
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:07,700
(The third nominee is Kwang Soo whose body is undergoing a crisis.)

1778
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:09,640
We will announce the fourth place. It goes to...

1779
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:10,930
(Who's in 4th place among these 3?)

1780
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:11,970
- It's Haha. - It's me?

1781
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:13,400
(It's Haha.)

1782
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,330
- For real? - This is nonsense.

1783
01:10:15,730 --> 01:10:17,400
- Congratulations. You're fourth. - It's me?

1784
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,370
I'm the youngest in Running Man.

1785
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,830
You're in fourth place.

1786
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:23,900
I'm okay with losing to you.

1787
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:26,570
- You're right above me. - He's 20 years older than me.

1788
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:30,970
It's because I've been drinking a lot these days.

1789
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:32,000
You've been drinking too much.

1790
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,500
He'd call me out and make me drink. He doesn't drink himself.

1791
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:39,300
Who'll score the last place on their physical checkup?

1792
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:40,730
- Let me reveal 6th place. - It's 6th place.

1793
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:42,100
Please.

1794
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,700
(He can't embarrass himself as the youngest member.)

1795
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:48,900
(He already has the worst fortune.)

1796
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,730
Sixth place goes to...

1797
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:52,640
(Who has the worst results for their physical checkup?)

1798
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,000
Seok Jin.

1799
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:55,370
Seok Jin.

1800
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:56,430
(Seok Jin has the worst luck, tarot read, and health.)

1801
01:10:56,430 --> 01:10:58,640
Are you okay? Don't cry.

1802
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:00,870
I'm sick of being last place.

1803
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:03,330
- I'm relieved. - I'm sick of being last place.

1804
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:06,140
- Seok Jin will get 50 R Balls... - That's good.

1805
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:08,670
- That's not good. - It is.

1806
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:09,770
Please give him some herbal medicine.

1807
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:12,000
- He's not healthy. - Isn't that sophora root tea?

1808
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:16,100
It's a type of tonic.

1809
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,530
It invigorates and improves blood circulation.

1810
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:20,070
Really? It's good for him.

1811
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:21,930
- Seok Jin will distribute these. - I'll take one.

1812
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:24,500
- I'll take one. - Seok Jin will hand them out.

1813
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:27,470
- I really like you. - Thank you.

1814
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,370
You don't have to give me so many.

1815
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:31,500
And...

1816
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:34,270
- I feel sorry for Haha. - Have pity on me.

1817
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:36,700
- You pity me, right? - I do.

1818
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:39,640
- We've been hurt. - Ji Hyo.

1819
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:41,300
- Excuse me. - I like you a lot.

1820
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:42,430
We've been hurt a lot.

1821
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:45,000
- We've been hurt a lot, Seok Jin. - I like you a lot.

1822
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,200
(Jong Kook will take it all.)

1823
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,270
For you...

1824
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:50,430
Here you go.

1825
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:51,700
(Ripping)

1826
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,200
Here you go.

1827
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:54,700
Is this allowed?

1828
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,400
I'm envious of you.

1829
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,470
(That concludes the checkup. There's only one category left.)

1830
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:02,140
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo have the most R Balls and Haha has the least.)

1831
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:03,700
(Running Man's new year physical checkup)

1832
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:05,430
(Running Man's new year verification of competence)

1833
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:06,570
Here's the last category.

1834
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,000
It's time to verify your competences.

1835
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
It's "R Ball Name Tag Elimination".

1836
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,170
It's Name Tag Elimination?

1837
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:16,230
You'll be assigned a target by lottery.

1838
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:18,640
Whenever you remove a person,

1839
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,370
the number of R Balls reduces by half.

1840
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:24,000
You also get a chance for revival.

1841
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:27,270
There are three boxes that contain Revival Cards.

1842
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:29,070
(Targets have been assigned and the game starts.)

1843
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:30,500
I have no chance.

1844
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,300
Who has me?

1845
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,670
We don't know who has who. I can't just pick on people.

1846
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:38,140
- You must trust me. - Okay, let's go.

1847
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:39,500
Jae Seok.

1848
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:41,730
Who do you have?

1849
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:45,670
(Kwang Soo picked Jong Kook. The three of them face each other.)

1850
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:47,830
You scared me.

1851
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:50,700
If you're going to help me, you have to be all-in.

1852
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,970
(Kwang Soo pretended that his target is Jae Seok.)

1853
01:12:52,970 --> 01:12:55,640
(Jong Kook got fooled.)

1854
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:56,700
(Kwang Soo backstabs him.)

1855
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:57,770
Was it me?

1856
01:12:57,770 --> 01:13:00,270
(That's the 1st backstabbing of 2017.)

1857
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:01,800
He's very mad right now.

1858
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,170
Leave, Kwang Soo.

1859
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:06,230
(Kwang Soo didn't realize what tragedy lied ahead of him.)

1860
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:08,230
(Jong Kook awakens.)

1861
01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:10,700
(Kwang Soo's betrayal...)

1862
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:11,970
(makes Jong Kook mad.)

1863
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:14,140
- What's going on? - Rip his name tag.

1864
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,270
(I'll eradicate the root of treachery.)

1865
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,070
(This is the start of Jong Kook's name tag hunting.)

1866
01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:21,140
Don't do this.

1867
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:22,700
(Jong Kook shows what he's capable of.)

1868
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:23,870
(He's invincible in 2017 yet again.)

1869
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:25,000
You're done.

1870
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,140
(He goes from 20 R Balls to 1.)

1871
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:29,500
(This is how risky betrayals are.)

1872
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,900
(Outdoor parking lot at SBS Headquarters)

1873
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:36,140
2017 Running Man,

1874
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:38,930
it's time for the bath.

1875
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:41,970
Please place your R Balls inside this lottery wheel.

1876
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:44,000
- Let's start with Haha. - I have 10.

1877
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:45,640
You only have 10?

1878
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,530
- Haha, it's behind you. - My goodness.

1879
01:13:47,530 --> 01:13:50,140
Place your R Balls inside the lottery wheel.

1880
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:53,570
(Haha has 10 R Balls.)

1881
01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:55,430
(Seok Jin has 26 R Balls.)

1882
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:57,270
This is making me nervous.

1883
01:13:57,430 --> 01:13:58,640
I have less than before.

1884
01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:01,870
Jong Kook, not only should you wish that you don't get picked,

1885
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,770
but you better also wish that I don't get picked.

1886
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,530
Let's say Jong Kook put 21 R Balls in the wheel.

1887
01:14:07,070 --> 01:14:09,600
- Shake it well. - I did.

1888
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:10,770
This is insane.

1889
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,170
I'll close the opening.

1890
01:14:14,270 --> 01:14:15,430
Please.

1891
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:17,000
(This is the final R Ball count.)

1892
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,100
(Running Man members await their fates.)

1893
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,670
Let me reiterate.

1894
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:24,330
The person that gets picked by lottery...

1895
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,140
will get the water bucket.

1896
01:14:26,330 --> 01:14:28,930
They'll become the first runner for Member's Week.

1897
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:32,270
As the first runner,

1898
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:36,070
they can pick the next runner.

1899
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:39,270
Whoever is picked will also get the water bucket.

1900
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,400
- Are you ready? - Yes.

1901
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,270
- The draw... - Please.

1902
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:45,800
- The draw starts now. - Please.

1903
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:47,430
(The draw starts.)

1904
01:14:47,430 --> 01:14:49,300
- Please. - Please.

1905
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:51,830
- Please. - Please.

1906
01:14:51,870 --> 01:14:54,230
(There are about 80 R Balls with 6 names on them.)

1907
01:14:54,230 --> 01:14:56,500
- Take your time, Hwan. - Please.

1908
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:57,970
(Nobody can predict the result.)

1909
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:00,300
The first person that will take the water bucket...

1910
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:03,700
(The first person that will take the water bucket...)

1911
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,730
- Please. - Please, Hwan.

1912
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:07,430
- Please, Hwan. - Please.

1913
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:09,100
(The decision can't be taken back.)

1914
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:10,230
Please.

1915
01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:14,330
(Who will get the water bucket...)

1916
01:15:14,330 --> 01:15:17,730
(and be the first runner of the Member's Week?)

1917
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:19,730
- Please. - Don't let it be me.

1918
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:21,140
(Who will get the honor?)

1919
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:22,140
Please.

1920
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:24,870
- Please. - He has it.

1921
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:26,170
He has it.

1922
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:28,470
- He has it. - He has it.

1923
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:29,700
Please. I can't see.

1924
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,100
Please, please. I can't see.

1925
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:43,930
Please. It can't be Kwang Soo.

1926
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:47,470
(What would the result be?)

1927
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:49,700
All right. The first runner...

1928
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:51,770
- for the Member's Week... - No!

1929
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:53,600
(First runner for the Member's Week)

1930
01:15:53,600 --> 01:16:01,600
(Who does it go to?)

1931
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:02,970
It's Ji Hyo.

1932
01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:04,270
(Ji Hyo gets picked.)

1933
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:05,730
It's Ji Hyo.

1934
01:16:05,730 --> 01:16:07,430
(Oh my goodness!)

1935
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:08,870
It's Ji Hyo.

1936
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,770
(Splashing)

1937
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:18,100
(That was a powerful one.)

1938
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,330
- Are you okay, Ji Hyo? - Ji Hyo.

1939
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:25,700
(It's holy water that contains the spirit of Year of the Chicken.)

1940
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:30,800
(I hope everybody is happy this year.)

1941
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:33,570
(Ji Hyo is the first runner for the Member's Week.)

1942
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:35,430
- Ji Hyo. - Are you okay, Ji Hyo?

1943
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:37,530
- Ji Hyo. - Are you okay, Ji Hyo?

1944
01:16:37,530 --> 01:16:39,300
You almost fainted.

1945
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,200
- Are you okay, Ji Hyo? - Think about...

1946
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:45,430
- who ripped your name tag. - Ji Hyo is the first runner.

1947
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:47,730
- That was strong. - Do I get to pick now?

1948
01:16:47,730 --> 01:16:50,330
You get to pick the second person.

1949
01:16:50,330 --> 01:16:52,170
- Really? - Are you all right?

1950
01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:54,330
- Yes, I'm okay. - Whisper in my ear.

1951
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:55,470
- You are okay, right? - Miss Ji Hyo.

1952
01:16:55,470 --> 01:16:57,370
- Miss Ji Hyo. - Today...

1953
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:59,270
- Ji Hyo. - Today...

1954
01:16:59,270 --> 01:17:01,400
- No, Ji Hyo. - Do you think it was me?

1955
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:04,100
- Are you all right, Ji Hyo? - Get back to your spots.

1956
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:06,070
- All right. - Go back.

1957
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:07,530
(Let's see.)

1958
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:09,830
- Ji Hyo, - Yes?

1959
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:11,530
you can whisper one's name in my ear.

1960
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:16,400
(Would she punish Jong Kook for being ruthless...)

1961
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,830
(or punish somebody else that she prefers?)

1962
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:22,000
- I let you rip my name tag. - Seriously...

1963
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,570
(His loyalty grows all of a sudden.)

1964
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,070
Please do me a favor.

1965
01:17:27,070 --> 01:17:29,470
- Miss Ji Hyo. - I love you, Ji Hyo.

1966
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:31,500
- You're beautiful. You're so sexy. - Let's pick Kwang Soo.

1967
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,400
Just think about what happened today.

1968
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,430
- That doesn't matter. - Do you want to talk it over?

1969
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:39,730
- I'll talk it over with you. - I'm serious.

1970
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:42,500
The second runner...

1971
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:44,930
for the Member's Week...

1972
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:48,830
- Is it me? - Why are you looking at me?

1973
01:17:49,170 --> 01:17:50,370
Is it me?

1974
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:51,800
Why is he looking in this direction?

1975
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:56,230
(Ji Hyo is unpredictable. Who did she pick?)

1976
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,730
It's Jong Kook.

1977
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:02,430
(She picked Jong Kook.)

1978
01:18:03,070 --> 01:18:05,100
(Let's go, Ji Hyo.)

1979
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:09,730
(Splashing)

1980
01:18:09,730 --> 01:18:12,600
(Jong Kook is the second runner for the Member's Week.)

1981
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:15,230
Are you all right?

1982
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,000
Aren't you cold?

1983
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,730
(They all look after Jong Kook in case he gets mad.)

1984
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:21,470
- Are you all right? - Are you okay?

1985
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,270
Why did these two get picked?

1986
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,100
This is what I told Hwan. Things have happened already,

1987
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,730
- so let's take the water bucket. - Let's start fresh.

1988
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,330
- That's what I told him. - Excellent.

1989
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:32,000
- Let's take the water bucket. - That's what she said.

1990
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,600
- Let's start fresh. - Next year,

1991
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:36,570
- let's have good things happen. - That's right.

1992
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:37,770
That makes sense.

1993
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:41,000
- Ji Hyo. - I wish you the best.

1994
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,140
- Ji Hyo. - Jong Kook.

1995
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:47,570
- Jong Kook. - Be quiet.

1996
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,500
- You're all in this together. - We're not.

1997
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,700
Don't say that.

1998
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,600
That's not true.

1999
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,230
You're all in this together.

2000
01:18:56,530 --> 01:18:58,470
- Are you in this too? - That's not true.

2001
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,070
Are you in it too?

2002
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,530
You too?

2003
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,200
What are you talking about?

2004
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:06,670
That's not true, Jong Kook.

2005
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:09,800
- Is it you? You punk. - Hey.

2006
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,000
- Come here. Punish him. - You punks.

2007
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,100
- Where's Cheol Min? - Take the water bucket.

2008
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:16,500
The members have agreed...

2009
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:19,770
- You punks. - to punish the staff members.

2010
01:19:20,070 --> 01:19:22,000
Let's take the water buckets...

2011
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
- and start fresh next year. - Let's start fresh.

2012
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,970
We apologize again, viewers. We'll work harder.

2013
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:28,900
- We'll run harder. - Thank you.

2014
01:19:29,170 --> 01:19:30,700
Let's pour the water buckets.

2015
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:34,200
- In 1, 2, 3. - They need to experience it.

2016
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:40,170
(The volume of water increased.)

2017
01:19:40,170 --> 01:19:43,370
(We're sorry for not able to protect you, Running Man members.)

2018
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:46,470
(We'll treat you better.)

2019
01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:48,970
(They didn't realize how strong the water force was.)

2020
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,800
Thank you for joining us today, Hwan.

2021
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:54,970
(We thank Hwan for being the host for the kickoff.)

2022
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:58,430
We'll renew our determinations...

2023
01:19:58,430 --> 01:20:01,370
and work with the staff to run even farther.

2024
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:04,970
- Viewers, Happy New Year! - Happy New Year!

2025
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:07,230
(Viewers, Happy New Year.)

2026
01:20:07,730 --> 01:20:10,300
(Member's Week is finally getting started.)

2027
01:20:11,570 --> 01:20:14,670
(Ji Hyo will be coming to you for next week's Member's Week.)
