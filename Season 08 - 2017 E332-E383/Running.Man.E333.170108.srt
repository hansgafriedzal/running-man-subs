1
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:08,906
It's 2017 Running Man's new project, Member's Week.

2
00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:12,116
The first member is Song Ji Hyo.

3
00:00:12,286 --> 00:00:16,156
I've been wanting to go on a trip with the members.

4
00:00:16,156 --> 00:00:18,746
We'll have a barbecue and a campfire.

5
00:00:18,746 --> 00:00:21,216
We can roast sweet potatoes with the bonfire.

6
00:00:21,216 --> 00:00:24,316
We will go on a trip as a whole. I can't wait for it.

7
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:25,846
(However...)

8
00:00:26,286 --> 00:00:29,946
(Is this a tangled link between you and me?)

9
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,756
(The staff members are bullies.)

10
00:00:32,756 --> 00:00:35,586
(This isn't the trip I expected.)

11
00:00:35,586 --> 00:00:39,246
(The ultimate winter trip beyond imagination is here.)

12
00:00:40,816 --> 00:00:41,886
(Even the 900-year-old goblin visited here.)

13
00:00:41,886 --> 00:00:43,946
The drama, "Goblin", was filmed here.

14
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:45,286
- Really? - I'm certain.

15
00:00:45,316 --> 00:00:47,516
- Look at this. - Thanks to Ji Hyo, we are here.

16
00:00:47,746 --> 00:00:50,646
- Let's hear why she picked here. - Yes, let's do that.

17
00:00:50,686 --> 00:00:53,946
Besides, she wanted to go on a trip...

18
00:00:53,946 --> 00:00:55,916
- without the cameras. - This isn't what she wanted.

19
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:58,316
- We can't do this with cameras. - If only there were no cameras...

20
00:00:58,316 --> 00:01:01,586
Can't we each have an individual camera on our own?

21
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:03,616
Ji Hyo, why are we here?

22
00:01:03,616 --> 00:01:06,546
- At least we should know why. - Why are we here?

23
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:08,786
- Thanks to Ji Hyo, we are here. - Everyone,

24
00:01:08,886 --> 00:01:10,786
- we are on our trip! - Why are we here?

25
00:01:11,456 --> 00:01:13,216
- We are on a trip. - She looks happy.

26
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,086
I'm glad we are here, but we should've come without the cameras.

27
00:01:16,586 --> 00:01:18,286
I didn't know there were so many cameras here.

28
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,846
- That's exactly my point. - How can you not know?

29
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,986
- How can you not see them? - What are you saying?

30
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:24,986
- It's been seven years. - You really didn't know?

31
00:01:24,986 --> 00:01:27,286
- Why are we here? - Yes, why?

32
00:01:27,286 --> 00:01:28,346
- Why? - Why are we in Pyeongchang?

33
00:01:28,346 --> 00:01:29,586
- Let's hear it. - Today, I...

34
00:01:29,586 --> 00:01:32,116
Just like we told you last week,

35
00:01:32,316 --> 00:01:34,586
today is the first day of Member's Week.

36
00:01:34,946 --> 00:01:36,716
- The first member is... - It's Ji Hyo.

37
00:01:36,716 --> 00:01:38,086
Right, it's Ji Hyo.

38
00:01:38,146 --> 00:01:41,846
I will reveal the theme that Ji Hyo has decided for Member's Week.

39
00:01:41,846 --> 00:01:42,916
What is it?

40
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,916
- "Ranch"? - There's a barbecue?

41
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,086
This does look like a trip.

42
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:48,646
- There's a campfire. - We're going to Daegwallyeong?

43
00:01:48,646 --> 00:01:50,886
- Are we going to a sheep ranch? - Barbecue and campfire...

44
00:01:50,886 --> 00:01:52,016
Ranch in Daegwallyeong?

45
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:54,416
- This is my first time going there. - Someone told me to prepare...

46
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:57,716
two sets of underwear, but I can't see where we would get wet.

47
00:01:57,716 --> 00:01:59,816
Soon, the season of winter trips will begin.

48
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,616
During the snowy winter,

49
00:02:01,786 --> 00:02:04,646
as Ji Hyo wished to go on a trip...

50
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:06,516
that brought the members together,

51
00:02:07,046 --> 00:02:09,146
we have prepared a winter trip for the members...

52
00:02:09,146 --> 00:02:11,516
right here in Pyeongchang.

53
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:13,646
The itinerary that you are looking at was...

54
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,386
put together to suit your preferences.

55
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:17,646
Do you like the itinerary?

56
00:02:17,646 --> 00:02:19,416
- Why do we need extra underwear? - We have to see it.

57
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:21,816
Are you worried we might pee during the campfire?

58
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,516
The board wasn't big enough.

59
00:02:24,516 --> 00:02:26,646
- Could you flip it? - There's a back side of it?

60
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,716
I guess there is.

61
00:02:28,746 --> 00:02:34,146
(What is it? What are we doing today?)

62
00:02:34,146 --> 00:02:37,886
(Is it a romantic trip on a snowy field?)

63
00:02:37,886 --> 00:02:44,216
(Is it a trip that will unite us as one on a romantic snowfield?)

64
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:47,386
(The last stop is ice shower at an icy valley.)

65
00:02:47,386 --> 00:02:49,416
(This is why they need two sets of underwear.)

66
00:02:51,146 --> 00:02:52,216
My goodness.

67
00:02:52,216 --> 00:02:54,816
- What do you mean by ice shower? - Are we really doing that?

68
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:56,616
We can just go to a sauna.

69
00:02:56,786 --> 00:02:59,086
- Another ice shower? - We did that last week.

70
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:01,346
What's the point of it if it's going to be edited out?

71
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:03,516
It's no use if it will be edited out.

72
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,586
It might not be edited out this time.

73
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:06,786
(His part for the shower was cut.)

74
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:10,386
Water in Pyeongchang is known to be cold.

75
00:03:10,386 --> 00:03:12,646
- Look at that water. - It looks so cold.

76
00:03:12,646 --> 00:03:14,646
Look at it. Chunks of ice are floating.

77
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:18,686
My goodness. This is no joke.

78
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:22,216
(If Ji Hyo wants us to do it, then we will.)

79
00:03:22,216 --> 00:03:25,986
(Who will face the ice shower? It will be the highlight of the trip.)

80
00:03:28,546 --> 00:03:29,886
This isn't the end.

81
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:33,686
We've prepared something to bring you all together.

82
00:03:33,986 --> 00:03:35,016
What is it?

83
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:36,846
- Why? - Come on.

84
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:39,846
- This is too much. - Is this what Ji Hyo wanted?

85
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:41,746
- We're going to be tied together? - My gosh.

86
00:03:42,146 --> 00:03:44,546
- Come on. - Please.

87
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,946
- Did I want this? - Is this what you wanted?

88
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:49,616
- This isn't what I expected. - Why do we need to be tied?

89
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,386
- I don't understand why we should. - This isn't what I wanted.

90
00:03:52,686 --> 00:03:54,386
- How do we... - With this...

91
00:03:54,386 --> 00:03:56,286
When I said I wanted the trip to unite us as one,

92
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:58,846
I didn't mean it literally.

93
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,816
- My gosh. - We are united as one indeed.

94
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,646
Hey, we are at last united as one.

95
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:05,216
What is all this?

96
00:04:05,586 --> 00:04:07,686
- Is this it? - This is it.

97
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:10,486
- She's going to lead us? - She will drag us?

98
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:12,946
- Ji Hyo will... - We aren't dogs.

99
00:04:12,946 --> 00:04:14,156
We look like slaves.

100
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:16,416
Ji Hyo, can you pull the rope?

101
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:19,346
- The secret of this rope is... - Move as far as it allows you to.

102
00:04:19,446 --> 00:04:20,886
When she pulls the rope...

103
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,046
(When she pulls the linked rope...)

104
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:24,616
What's going on?

105
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:28,046
- It's pulling us closer. - I see now.

106
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:30,946
- We are all clustered. - What is this? Come on.

107
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:32,686
- My goodness. - Gosh.

108
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:35,086
- What is all this? - Is it really necessary?

109
00:04:35,086 --> 00:04:36,446
- What is this? - You don't have to do this.

110
00:04:37,046 --> 00:04:39,656
- We can't be united like this. - This looks weird.

111
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,186
The first week of Member's Week.

112
00:04:42,186 --> 00:04:44,186
It's Running Man Link Trip.

113
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:47,316
The subtitle for this episode is "It's Not What You Think".

114
00:04:47,686 --> 00:04:48,816
This is it.

115
00:04:48,816 --> 00:04:50,416
Do you want us to bury you in a mountain?

116
00:04:51,786 --> 00:04:54,516
We made this link following Ji Hyo's wish...

117
00:04:54,686 --> 00:04:57,116
to bring all the members together through the trip.

118
00:04:57,116 --> 00:04:59,916
Starting now, you will have to survive...

119
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,446
until the trip is over.

120
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:04,346
- Even when we go to the restroom? - Yes.

121
00:05:04,616 --> 00:05:07,686
Moreover, you must be chosen in order to enjoy...

122
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:10,686
what's on the itinerary. Chosen members will be...

123
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,516
able to get off the rope for it.

124
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:13,946
There's a chance we can get out?

125
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:15,986
- Yes, there is. - I see.

126
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:19,546
Until the trip is over, you can only...

127
00:05:19,816 --> 00:05:22,546
- disengage the rope twice. - Is that so?

128
00:05:23,386 --> 00:05:25,386
When you want to disengage the rope,

129
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:28,316
Ji Hyo has to give you permission.

130
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:31,486
How do the members get selected? Does Ji Hyo get to choose?

131
00:05:31,486 --> 00:05:33,946
Will our beautiful Ji Hyo pick?

132
00:05:34,586 --> 00:05:35,916
(My gosh.)

133
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,716
- You're glowing today. - You get one point.

134
00:05:37,716 --> 00:05:38,886
We're 30-year-old friends!

135
00:05:39,446 --> 00:05:41,986
- She will personally choose. - My gosh.

136
00:05:41,986 --> 00:05:44,946
- Last week, you had the ice... - It will be too cold.

137
00:05:44,946 --> 00:05:46,846
Shower, representing the Running Man members.

138
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:52,016
(Last week, the first episode of the new year)

139
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:56,186
(She endured the pouring water as they welcomed the new year.)

140
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:59,486
- Ji Hyo. - I was the first one to get it.

141
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,946
I felt a bit disappointed for the members who didn't...

142
00:06:03,316 --> 00:06:04,386
have the chance to get it.

143
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:07,516
I wish they can feel what it is to become one with water.

144
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:12,646
- Ice shower? - We did that last week.

145
00:06:12,646 --> 00:06:14,816
She wanted to share this since it was...

146
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:16,546
- a great experience for her. - I experienced it.

147
00:06:16,546 --> 00:06:17,746
I did, too.

148
00:06:18,216 --> 00:06:19,616
- I did. - When did you do it, Seok Jin?

149
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:21,386
- It was edited out. - When did you get it?

150
00:06:21,386 --> 00:06:22,916
- Where did you do it? - When did you do it, Seok Jin?

151
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,046
- I did it. - When?

152
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:27,486
- Don't you remember? - Seriously. When did you do it?

153
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:30,546
- It wasn't aired. - Please stop it, Seok Jin.

154
00:06:30,546 --> 00:06:31,786
Seok Jin.

155
00:06:32,046 --> 00:06:33,786
- Please stop. - I mean...

156
00:06:33,786 --> 00:06:35,916
How can you not remember it? It was only last week.

157
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,546
- I don't. - What is he talking about?

158
00:06:37,546 --> 00:06:39,946
- When did he do it? - This is how you ruin a person.

159
00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:41,516
This is how.

160
00:06:41,716 --> 00:06:44,386
Members who may face an ice shower are...

161
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:46,746
all the members except for Ji Hyo.

162
00:06:46,746 --> 00:06:49,086
- She's exempted? - But I had it last week.

163
00:06:49,086 --> 00:06:51,716
- Exclude the ones who did it. - However, as always,

164
00:06:51,716 --> 00:06:52,816
there's hope.

165
00:06:52,816 --> 00:06:55,346
There are several missions during the trip.

166
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:58,886
Every time you accomplish your mission, we will grant you...

167
00:06:59,016 --> 00:07:01,386
- a chance to exclude one member. - Is that so?

168
00:07:01,886 --> 00:07:05,746
- Is that true? - Let's enjoy the trip as you...

169
00:07:05,746 --> 00:07:07,446
come together as one. Let's go to the first stop.

170
00:07:07,446 --> 00:07:09,846
- Are we going to the sheep ranch? - Yes.

171
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,916
Let's go.

172
00:07:11,446 --> 00:07:13,546
- Disengage us. - Where should I go?

173
00:07:13,546 --> 00:07:15,486
Give us some room.

174
00:07:15,486 --> 00:07:17,746
Let's get our trip started.

175
00:07:17,746 --> 00:07:19,386
Are we your huskies?

176
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:22,146
- I'm hungry. Let's eat ramyeon. - What is this?

177
00:07:22,346 --> 00:07:25,286
- Let's start our trip. - Ji Hyo, let's eat first.

178
00:07:25,286 --> 00:07:27,186
- I should've worn boots like yours. - Ji Hyo,

179
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:29,086
I like your outfit today.

180
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,716
- My outfit? - You look like a foreigner.

181
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:33,416
- You can release two people. - I like your outfit.

182
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,316
You look better when you show your forehead.

183
00:07:35,316 --> 00:07:37,886
- Her forehead is so pretty. - That's a pretty forehead.

184
00:07:37,886 --> 00:07:40,016
- Ji Hyo already started. - This isn't the trip I wanted.

185
00:07:40,086 --> 00:07:42,586
- Ji Hyo, you are so pretty. - I can't stand cheesy comments.

186
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:45,886
- She hates this kind of thing. - Please stop it.

187
00:07:45,986 --> 00:07:48,086
I knew she was pretty, but her forehead is stunning.

188
00:07:48,116 --> 00:07:50,486
- Seok Jin, you lost a point. - Why?

189
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:52,346
- Seok Jin, you lost a point. - I didn't do anything, Ji Hyo.

190
00:07:52,486 --> 00:07:54,416
She can take away a point from Seok Jin.

191
00:07:54,716 --> 00:07:56,716
- Are we going to have lamb? - I like lamb.

192
00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:58,316
Kwang Soo deserves to lose two points.

193
00:07:58,316 --> 00:08:00,516
Hey, you lost five points.

194
00:08:01,586 --> 00:08:03,946
- You can't bribe me. - It's not that cold today.

195
00:08:03,946 --> 00:08:06,146
- It isn't a bribe. - Yes, it's not cold.

196
00:08:06,146 --> 00:08:08,446
- Pre-schools are on a break. - This is so pretty.

197
00:08:08,546 --> 00:08:10,816
- This is pretty, but will we go in? - It is beautiful.

198
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:11,846
How beautiful.

199
00:08:12,146 --> 00:08:14,146
- You are prettier. - You are prettier.

200
00:08:14,146 --> 00:08:15,446
You are more beautiful.

201
00:08:15,446 --> 00:08:18,086
- Seok Jin, you lost two points. - I only complimented you.

202
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:20,216
- Why do you keep deducting points? - This is beautiful indeed.

203
00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:22,646
Why don't you take off points for Seok Jin from the start?

204
00:08:22,646 --> 00:08:25,316
- Ji Hyo. - Should we take a photo there?

205
00:08:25,316 --> 00:08:27,886
- Yes, let's take a picture. - Shall we?

206
00:08:27,886 --> 00:08:29,846
In 1, 2, 3.

207
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:32,786
- Hey, why am I not in the frame? - Seok Jin's not in it.

208
00:08:32,786 --> 00:08:33,846
Hey.

209
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,786
- Seriously, Seok Jin isn't in it. - Well done, Ji Hyo.

210
00:08:35,786 --> 00:08:36,916
(They are excited to be on a trip.)

211
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,216
- Did you see that? - This is too cruel.

212
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:40,016
Do you know how many points you have lost so far, Seok Jin?

213
00:08:40,016 --> 00:08:41,516
He's going to get it today.

214
00:08:41,516 --> 00:08:43,146
I'm certain you will get it, Seok Jin.

215
00:08:43,186 --> 00:08:44,986
I think we're going there by bus.

216
00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:47,446
- Let's get on the bus. - Can we get on it like this?

217
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:49,216
- Can we sit? - It's cold.

218
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:51,186
- How can we sit? - I see towels on the bus.

219
00:08:51,256 --> 00:08:53,016
- What are the towels implying? - I see them.

220
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:54,916
- Does it mean we'll get wet? - Towels are on the bus.

221
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,116
You can scoot over and I will sit here.

222
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,816
It feels like we are all tangled up here.

223
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:02,946
- We are tangled. - Kwang Soo, sit there.

224
00:09:03,516 --> 00:09:04,786
- I think you should come here. - That's better.

225
00:09:04,786 --> 00:09:07,046
- Why is the rope twisted? - That's it.

226
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,346
- Hold on. - We can sit down.

227
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:10,386
Seok Jin will get in the water.

228
00:09:10,386 --> 00:09:13,116
- No, to be honest... - I bet you won't be chosen.

229
00:09:13,116 --> 00:09:14,786
- Ji Hyo. - Seok Jin.

230
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:17,256
Since his part was edited out last week, this week's part won't be.

231
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,486
Seok Jin, you should just give up.

232
00:09:18,486 --> 00:09:22,316
After that, I was only in the full shot.

233
00:09:22,816 --> 00:09:24,886
Ji Hyo's side face is so...

234
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:27,916
How would you grade that, Ji Hyo?

235
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,416
That made you really uncomfortable, didn't it?

236
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,586
Seok Jin keeps studying her face.

237
00:09:32,586 --> 00:09:34,316
I never compliment women.

238
00:09:34,316 --> 00:09:37,116
- That's not true. - I don't even compliment my wife.

239
00:09:37,216 --> 00:09:39,586
She's the only woman you didn't give compliment to. I saw you...

240
00:09:39,586 --> 00:09:41,686
Be quiet. Shut it.

241
00:09:41,686 --> 00:09:43,046
(The compliment relay left nothing but scars.)

242
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:44,516
Why would you say that?

243
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:47,386
Doesn't this place really feel like winter?

244
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,386
Yes.

245
00:09:48,716 --> 00:09:50,316
(Now is the time to flatter her.)

246
00:09:50,316 --> 00:09:53,346
I can't express how grateful I am.

247
00:09:53,346 --> 00:09:54,346
I'm so happy.

248
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:56,516
What's his score? Is it in the minus?

249
00:09:56,516 --> 00:09:58,116
It's not in the minus. It's a positive score.

250
00:09:58,516 --> 00:10:01,756
(Why do you only hate me?)

251
00:10:01,756 --> 00:10:04,186
Ji Hyo won't even look to Seok Jin's side.

252
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,756
Why am I the only one in the minus?

253
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:08,646
- Why do you only hate me? - Look at the mountains.

254
00:10:08,646 --> 00:10:10,446
(Let's enjoy the scenery and relax ourselves.)

255
00:10:12,286 --> 00:10:14,946
- It feels like winter now. - If we kept staying in Seoul,

256
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:17,046
- we wouldn't have known. - Right.

257
00:10:17,286 --> 00:10:19,346
There's actual sheep.

258
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:21,716
- Where is it? - Over there.

259
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:24,146
- They're sheep. - She's right.

260
00:10:24,146 --> 00:10:25,446
(They're sheep.)

261
00:10:25,446 --> 00:10:27,216
- They look so cute running around. - Look at the sheep.

262
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,646
(This ranch is the first course of Running Man Link Trip.)

263
00:10:29,646 --> 00:10:30,756
- Where is it? - It's a sheep.

264
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:31,846
They look so cute running around.

265
00:10:31,846 --> 00:10:33,646
(It's therapeutic to just look at the cute herds of sheep.)

266
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:35,686
Look at the sheep. Hello, sheep!

267
00:10:35,686 --> 00:10:37,756
- There really are sheep. - Hello.

268
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:39,516
- There are even horses. - There are.

269
00:10:39,516 --> 00:10:40,516
(The snow covered field creates a beautiful scenery.)

270
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:45,686
(It's a therapeutic ranch in Pyeongchang.)

271
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,816
- How do we unlock this? - Just hop over it for now.

272
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,586
(It's a chaos.)

273
00:10:49,586 --> 00:10:51,916
- Does this go in here? - How does this work?

274
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,646
(It won't be therapeutic like this.)

275
00:10:53,646 --> 00:10:55,046
- Hop over it. - You have to come back, Seok Jin.

276
00:10:55,046 --> 00:10:56,746
- You have to do it over, Seok Jin. - You have to do it again, Seok Jin.

277
00:10:56,746 --> 00:10:57,946
- I do? - Yes.

278
00:10:57,946 --> 00:10:59,746
This is such a mess.

279
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:01,216
Is this it?

280
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:03,216
Gosh.

281
00:11:03,216 --> 00:11:04,286
Don't drag us around.

282
00:11:04,286 --> 00:11:05,486
Can I not go forward?

283
00:11:05,486 --> 00:11:07,286
(Ji Hyo is the only one who looks happy.)

284
00:11:07,286 --> 00:11:08,646
- There's sheep. - Gosh.

285
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:10,446
- I can't move forward like this. - There's sheep. Come on.

286
00:11:10,446 --> 00:11:11,586
(Ji Hyo has gone wild by the sheep.)

287
00:11:11,586 --> 00:11:12,846
Come on!

288
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:15,046
- There's sheep over there. - Come on!

289
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:16,386
- Gosh. - I don't know how this works.

290
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:17,586
- We'll have to look into it. - There are even horses.

291
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:19,446
There are even horses there.

292
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:22,746
- Stop running! - I can't look forward.

293
00:11:22,746 --> 00:11:23,946
- Sheep! - There really are sheep here.

294
00:11:23,946 --> 00:11:25,746
(Who's calling us?)

295
00:11:25,746 --> 00:11:27,386
- Ji Hyo. - Sheep!

296
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,016
(Answer me, Sheep.)

297
00:11:29,946 --> 00:11:32,286
- I didn't know it'd be this cold. - It's so cold.

298
00:11:32,446 --> 00:11:34,686
- Look at the sheep herd. - I have to wear the hood.

299
00:11:34,686 --> 00:11:36,016
- We really have to. - What do we do now?

300
00:11:36,016 --> 00:11:37,946
Let's go look at the horses.

301
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:39,686
- What? - Let's go look at the horses.

302
00:11:39,686 --> 00:11:41,686
- Why would we go there? - We can see them from here.

303
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:42,846
(The link is unintentionally having them go through winter training.)

304
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:44,246
- We can already see them from here. - Are you...

305
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:45,246
(Unlike them, the horses are free.)

306
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,586
Come over here.

307
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:49,986
- Ji Hyo, this episode is ruined. - This is not looking good.

308
00:11:50,386 --> 00:11:52,586
We should untie ourselves and go home after eating soondaeguk.

309
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,846
- Trips are supposed to be fun. - Why is it so windy?

310
00:11:54,846 --> 00:11:56,116
(What are they doing here?)

311
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,146
Gosh, it's so cold. What is that?

312
00:11:58,146 --> 00:11:59,346
(The members of Running Man arrive at the place of the mission.)

313
00:11:59,346 --> 00:12:00,586
Isn't this the electric thing?

314
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,816
(Are those lie detectors?)

315
00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:03,916
There are only five of them.

316
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,146
- Ji Hyo must not be doing it. - I guess so.

317
00:12:05,146 --> 00:12:08,646
Ji Hyo's Week, Running Man Link Trip.

318
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:12,716
The first course is called Shepherd Running Man.

319
00:12:13,016 --> 00:12:16,416
You will go look around the ranch...

320
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,246
as it's the first event of Ji Hyo's trip.

321
00:12:18,246 --> 00:12:20,846
- We're looking around? - Only one member...

322
00:12:21,046 --> 00:12:24,446
can be free from the link and look around freely.

323
00:12:24,446 --> 00:12:25,916
Nice.

324
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:30,646
Ji Hyo will conduct a polygraph test on the other members.

325
00:12:31,246 --> 00:12:33,646
She will take the person who only tell the truth...

326
00:12:33,646 --> 00:12:35,946
to go look around with her.

327
00:12:35,946 --> 00:12:38,416
For Ji Hyo and that other person,

328
00:12:38,646 --> 00:12:40,116
we've prepared a sled.

329
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:41,116
(Succeeding the mission will grant you a two-seater sled.)

330
00:12:41,116 --> 00:12:43,146
I bet the rest of the members will be pulling it.

331
00:12:43,186 --> 00:12:44,586
Are you kidding me?

332
00:12:44,586 --> 00:12:46,046
(The group opposes.)

333
00:12:46,046 --> 00:12:47,646
- Do you take us as Rudolph? - Gosh.

334
00:12:47,646 --> 00:12:48,686
Is this a Slave Special?

335
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:51,716
The other four members...

336
00:12:51,846 --> 00:12:54,486
will pull the sled and show the two around the ranch.

337
00:12:54,946 --> 00:12:57,916
I want to untie myself. It feels so uncomfortable.

338
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,246
I feel nauseous because of this.

339
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,416
I never thought a rope would do this.

340
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,786
Especially for Kwang Soo who falls in love quickly...

341
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,486
- Jae Seok. - He does.

342
00:13:05,486 --> 00:13:07,246
- Don't call me that. - Why?

343
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,286
Let's call him that from now on.

344
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:10,516
(Kwang Soo is at it again in Daegwallyeong.)

345
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:12,116
I watched the show with my mom last week.

346
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:14,516
I've never seen my mom laugh so hard.

347
00:13:14,516 --> 00:13:16,746
- Your mother likes it too. - She was laughing so hard.

348
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,146
- My mom was... - Your mother likes it too.

349
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:21,016
- My mom loved it. - See?

350
00:13:21,146 --> 00:13:22,746
It's good that your mother likes it.

351
00:13:22,746 --> 00:13:24,046
It's good.

352
00:13:24,046 --> 00:13:25,516
We just have to tell the truth, right?

353
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:28,046
- That's right. - That's all we have to do.

354
00:13:28,046 --> 00:13:30,686
- That's all it takes. - That's right.

355
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:31,746
(Kwang Soo goes first.)

356
00:13:31,746 --> 00:13:33,216
Let's start with Kwang Soo.

357
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,716
"Honestly, I think I'm just as popular as Song Joong Ki."

358
00:13:38,186 --> 00:13:40,316
That's a difficult question.

359
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:41,446
This is annoying.

360
00:13:41,746 --> 00:13:43,686
But isn't this an obvious question?

361
00:13:43,686 --> 00:13:47,316
(He doesn't even need to think about it.)

362
00:13:47,316 --> 00:13:50,446
- Isn't this an obvious question? - Yes.

363
00:13:51,146 --> 00:13:53,016
You think you're just as popular?

364
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:55,146
- Okay, let's see what it says. - That's what I think.

365
00:13:55,146 --> 00:13:56,416
You think you're just as popular?

366
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,046
That's what I think.

367
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,386
You're very confident.

368
00:14:01,146 --> 00:14:06,846
(You're definitely taller and funnier than him.)

369
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,846
(Kwang Soo told the truth.)

370
00:14:09,846 --> 00:14:11,286
Are you serious?

371
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:13,686
(Kwang Soo is a very confident guy.)

372
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,346
He thinks he's as sexy and as popular as Joong Ki.

373
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:16,746
He's a psychopath.

374
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:18,416
I'm entitled to my own opinions.

375
00:14:18,586 --> 00:14:20,246
- You think you're as sexy as him? - He's not lying right now.

376
00:14:20,246 --> 00:14:21,686
Fine. Take a seat.

377
00:14:21,686 --> 00:14:23,686
- He's not lying. - I'll ask another question.

378
00:14:23,686 --> 00:14:25,686
Haha just called you a psychopath.

379
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:27,816
- Why am I a psychopath? - Gosh.

380
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:29,586
- He really thinks that. - You should try again.

381
00:14:29,586 --> 00:14:30,816
- He's so weird. - Fine.

382
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:33,016
- Let's do another one. - Ask a question.

383
00:14:33,016 --> 00:14:36,616
"I'd marry my wife again in the next life."

384
00:14:36,846 --> 00:14:37,886
That's...

385
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:39,516
- Isn't it obvious? - He has to say yes.

386
00:14:39,686 --> 00:14:41,746
- Of course. - That is correct.

387
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:43,846
This is obvious for Seok Jin.

388
00:14:43,846 --> 00:14:46,816
(It should be true.)

389
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:49,646
(It's obviously...)

390
00:14:49,646 --> 00:14:51,486
(true.)

391
00:14:51,486 --> 00:14:52,986
- Okay. - What's going on?

392
00:14:53,146 --> 00:14:54,446
Is he serious?

393
00:14:54,446 --> 00:14:56,146
He must be.

394
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,486
Are you serious right now?

395
00:14:57,846 --> 00:14:58,846
Of course.

396
00:14:58,846 --> 00:15:00,746
- I got so surprised just now. - Hold on.

397
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:01,946
Ask him one more time, Ji Hyo.

398
00:15:02,046 --> 00:15:04,516
I didn't know you could fool yourself.

399
00:15:04,516 --> 00:15:07,116
- It's my turn now. - I'm a romantic person.

400
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:08,116
(Jae Seok goes third.)

401
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,816
Ask him if he'll marry his wife in the next life.

402
00:15:09,816 --> 00:15:11,116
- I'm confident. - Ask him.

403
00:15:11,116 --> 00:15:13,746
- Yes. I'm sure of it. - Are you sure?

404
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,016
- Let's see. - Will you marry your wife again...

405
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:18,316
- in the next life? - Of course.

406
00:15:18,316 --> 00:15:19,846
I'll marry her again.

407
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:21,446
By the way, Seok Jin passed.

408
00:15:21,446 --> 00:15:22,516
I passed.

409
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:28,646
(Will Jae Seok become a romantic person too?)

410
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:32,646
(It's a lie.)

411
00:15:32,646 --> 00:15:35,286
(The lie detector knows a thing or two.)

412
00:15:35,286 --> 00:15:36,686
There's something wrong with the machine.

413
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:38,646
Oh my.

414
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:41,646
- She might get the wrong idea. - Jae Seok.

415
00:15:41,646 --> 00:15:43,946
- There's been a misunderstanding. - How shocking.

416
00:15:43,946 --> 00:15:45,216
(Jae Seok fails.)

417
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:46,816
- She'll get the wrong idea. - I'm better than him.

418
00:15:46,816 --> 00:15:49,586
- This isn't... - Humans are imperfect beings.

419
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:51,486
There's been a misunderstanding.

420
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:52,816
This is so shocking.

421
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,046
Even I passed.

422
00:15:55,046 --> 00:15:58,216
- This result is shocking to me. - Goodness.

423
00:15:58,316 --> 00:15:59,916
This is the best twist since "The Sixth Sense".

424
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,216
- I love you. - Gosh.

425
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:03,746
It's Jong Kook's turn now.

426
00:16:04,286 --> 00:16:05,846
"I still like Yoon Eun Hye."

427
00:16:05,846 --> 00:16:09,046
(Does he still have Yoon Eun Hye on his mind?)

428
00:16:09,046 --> 00:16:10,246
Gosh.

429
00:16:10,246 --> 00:16:12,516
(Everyone wants to know the answer to that question.)

430
00:16:12,516 --> 00:16:15,416
(What will his answer be?)

431
00:16:16,946 --> 00:16:19,246
(They met 10 years ago.)

432
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:21,016
(Does he still have feelings for her?)

433
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:22,916
This one's nice.

434
00:16:23,186 --> 00:16:24,316
(Thinking carefully)

435
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,916
Look at Jong Kook.

436
00:16:26,646 --> 00:16:29,116
- Answer her. - Do I still like her?

437
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:31,216
- No. - It's a no.

438
00:16:31,216 --> 00:16:33,516
(His answer was no.)

439
00:16:33,516 --> 00:16:36,286
(Has he completely...)

440
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:40,416
(gotten over her?)

441
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:46,186
(He hasn't.)

442
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,986
What a liar.

443
00:16:48,516 --> 00:16:49,816
(They caught me.)

444
00:16:49,846 --> 00:16:51,586
You still haven't gotten over her.

445
00:16:52,116 --> 00:16:54,616
- How many years has it been? - The machine is faulty.

446
00:16:55,116 --> 00:16:56,746
(Jong Kook became a romantic person.)

447
00:16:56,746 --> 00:16:58,286
- You still haven't gotten over her. - No.

448
00:16:58,316 --> 00:17:00,046
No. That's not true.

449
00:17:00,046 --> 00:17:02,816
If you think about it, he's so clingy it's scary.

450
00:17:02,816 --> 00:17:04,186
- I know. - There's been a misunderstanding.

451
00:17:04,186 --> 00:17:05,416
You should meet again this year.

452
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,746
- That took me by surprise. - Jong Kook is amazing.

453
00:17:07,746 --> 00:17:09,046
He still hasn't gotten over her.

454
00:17:09,046 --> 00:17:10,816
He's a fool who only loves one person.

455
00:17:11,216 --> 00:17:12,816
(You should let her go in 2017.)

456
00:17:12,816 --> 00:17:15,046
That was such a long time ago.

457
00:17:15,046 --> 00:17:16,916
Next up is Haha.

458
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,146
(Haha goes last.)

459
00:17:18,146 --> 00:17:21,416
"Among all the female celebrities in Korea,."

460
00:17:21,816 --> 00:17:23,616
"Byul is the prettiest."

461
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,586
- You're doomed. - He has to say yes.

462
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,316
- It won't be right otherwise. - He has to.

463
00:17:27,316 --> 00:17:28,686
Is she the prettiest to you?

464
00:17:28,686 --> 00:17:30,046
- Yes. - He said yes.

465
00:17:30,046 --> 00:17:31,386
It's so obvious.

466
00:17:31,386 --> 00:17:33,146
He says it's obvious. What will it be?

467
00:17:33,146 --> 00:17:35,916
(Is his obvious answer the truth or not?)

468
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,646
(Are you watching, Byul?)

469
00:17:38,646 --> 00:17:41,246
(To me, )

470
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:45,646
(you're the prettiest.)

471
00:17:47,846 --> 00:17:51,346
(What is the result of the polygraph test?)

472
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:52,416
His hands are shaking.

473
00:17:53,016 --> 00:17:56,016
(It's a lie.)

474
00:17:58,146 --> 00:17:59,146
(I have to beg for forgiveness.)

475
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:00,386
Who is it then?

476
00:18:00,386 --> 00:18:03,016
(Will you be able to go home after this?)

477
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:05,346
Who do you think is the prettiest then?

478
00:18:05,346 --> 00:18:07,816
Can you let me go again? I'll say no.

479
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:11,116
She's not the prettiest. She's the most beautiful.

480
00:18:11,116 --> 00:18:14,416
This man still hasn't gotten over Yoon Eun Hye.

481
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,046
- Stop it. - This man...

482
00:18:16,046 --> 00:18:17,686
will marry a different woman in another life.

483
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:19,646
- That's right. - That's a misunderstanding.

484
00:18:19,646 --> 00:18:22,146
She may not be the prettiest celebrity...

485
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:23,586
But she's the one I'll marry.

486
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:24,916
- I'll marry her. - Are you happy?

487
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,646
Yes.

488
00:18:27,116 --> 00:18:29,346
- It's either one of these two. - Right.

489
00:18:29,646 --> 00:18:31,716
- I'll ask Kwang Soo now. - Okay.

490
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:33,146
"To be honest,."

491
00:18:33,686 --> 00:18:36,246
"I'm better than Jo In Sung."

492
00:18:37,286 --> 00:18:39,746
- Personally, I think I am. - In Sung?

493
00:18:40,246 --> 00:18:42,046
(Kwang Soo over In Sung?)

494
00:18:42,046 --> 00:18:43,346
He's so confident.

495
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:44,956
- We have different charms. - How?

496
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:46,646
- You think you're better? - Better than In Sung?

497
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:48,146
I think I am.

498
00:18:48,786 --> 00:18:54,146
(What does Kwang Soo really think?)

499
00:18:54,146 --> 00:18:57,516
(He couldn't beat In Sung.)

500
00:18:57,956 --> 00:18:59,586
(Kwang Soo is the only one who doesn't know.)

501
00:18:59,586 --> 00:19:01,956
- What's wrong with this? - He's absolutely crazy.

502
00:19:01,956 --> 00:19:03,216
- He's so confident. - He's crazy.

503
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:04,686
Who are you calling crazy?

504
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,916
- He's a lunatic. - It's my personal opinion.

505
00:19:07,516 --> 00:19:08,956
I'm just speaking my mind.

506
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:10,986
You think you're better than...

507
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:12,116
In Sung and Joong Ki?

508
00:19:12,116 --> 00:19:13,586
It's my personal opinion.

509
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,286
- That's true, but... - Everyone is unique in a way.

510
00:19:15,286 --> 00:19:16,456
He's completely crazy.

511
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,916
Why does this make me a crazy psychopath?

512
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,586
- It's Seok Jin's turn. - Gosh.

513
00:19:20,716 --> 00:19:23,386
Do you always want to go home early?

514
00:19:23,716 --> 00:19:24,746
Yes.

515
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:28,016
Is it because you want to see your beloved wife?

516
00:19:28,846 --> 00:19:31,316
He says he always wants to go home early.

517
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:32,956
- Must you ask that? - Yes.

518
00:19:32,956 --> 00:19:34,916
It's to save his own face.

519
00:19:34,986 --> 00:19:36,046
Of course.

520
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:38,616
I always want to go home early to eat dinner.

521
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:40,416
Is it to see your wife?

522
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:44,286
Yes, I want to eat dinner with my wife.

523
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:51,346
(Is he telling the truth about his love life?)

524
00:19:51,346 --> 00:19:54,286
(It's true.)

525
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,516
Gosh, Seok Jin.

526
00:19:56,846 --> 00:19:59,416
- That's impressive. - He's such a romantic guy.

527
00:19:59,516 --> 00:20:00,686
He's romantic after all.

528
00:20:00,686 --> 00:20:02,216
He's like Choi Su Jong.

529
00:20:02,216 --> 00:20:04,686
- He's very romantic. - He's like Sean.

530
00:20:05,646 --> 00:20:06,956
- That's right. - That's me.

531
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:09,816
Seok Jin isn't actually like this.

532
00:20:09,886 --> 00:20:13,016
- I feel like I'm born again today. - What a gentleman.

533
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:17,846
Ji Hyo and Seok Jin will take a look around the ranch.

534
00:20:17,846 --> 00:20:20,016
Please get on the sledge.

535
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,186
The remaining four members will pull the sledge.

536
00:20:23,186 --> 00:20:24,916
- All right. - My goodness.

537
00:20:26,646 --> 00:20:27,786
He looks excited.

538
00:20:27,786 --> 00:20:28,886
(It's time to take a look around.)

539
00:20:28,886 --> 00:20:30,046
This is the sledge.

540
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,716
- Where is it? - It's over here.

541
00:20:31,716 --> 00:20:32,816
(It's a great sledge for the ranch tour.)

542
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:34,456
- Are you okay? - Let's go.

543
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:36,616
- Let's go. - Come on.

544
00:20:36,616 --> 00:20:39,216
(Rudolph, let's go.)

545
00:20:39,216 --> 00:20:40,846
- What's this? - What's wrong with this?

546
00:20:40,846 --> 00:20:42,416
Here you go, Seok Jin.

547
00:20:42,486 --> 00:20:43,956
There's no cushion on it.

548
00:20:44,486 --> 00:20:46,346
There's no cushion on a sledge.

549
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:47,716
Here we go.

550
00:20:48,886 --> 00:20:50,316
(Struggling)

551
00:20:51,386 --> 00:20:53,916
(They wonder why they came on the trip.)

552
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,146
- Hurry. - I can't stay seated.

553
00:20:57,116 --> 00:20:58,116
Pull harder.

554
00:20:58,816 --> 00:21:01,346
(What kind of cruel passenger is this?)

555
00:21:02,456 --> 00:21:03,516
My goodness.

556
00:21:03,516 --> 00:21:05,486
Okay, in 1, 2, 3.

557
00:21:06,746 --> 00:21:07,916
What's this?

558
00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:10,716
This isn't a trip. It's a boot camp.

559
00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:13,316
Riding the sledge is more difficult.

560
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,586
- Ji Hyo. - What on earth is this?

561
00:21:17,216 --> 00:21:19,246
This is not a trip.

562
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:21,286
(What are they doing in the middle of winter?)

563
00:21:21,286 --> 00:21:22,586
In 1, 2, 3.

564
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:25,646
- This isn't a trip. - What are we doing?

565
00:21:25,816 --> 00:21:27,186
What kind of trip is this?

566
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,586
This isn't a trip.

567
00:21:29,586 --> 00:21:32,016
- This isn't a trip. - What are we doing?

568
00:21:32,016 --> 00:21:33,246
(We feel bad for you.)

569
00:21:33,786 --> 00:21:36,316
It's time for your mission.

570
00:21:36,316 --> 00:21:37,746
- If you succeed, - We don't go in the water?

571
00:21:38,186 --> 00:21:39,686
One of you is exempted from the punishment.

572
00:21:39,686 --> 00:21:41,786
- Okay. - At this place,

573
00:21:41,986 --> 00:21:45,346
there are many sheep running in the snow.

574
00:21:45,716 --> 00:21:49,186
Do you see the sheep shed in the back?

575
00:21:49,346 --> 00:21:51,886
If you put 30 sheep in the shed within 3 minutes, you succeed.

576
00:21:51,886 --> 00:21:54,016
- Which sheep? - Sheep are very heavy.

577
00:21:54,286 --> 00:21:55,886
You herd the sheep.

578
00:21:55,886 --> 00:21:57,216
- You herd them. - Why would you carry them?

579
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:58,986
- You herd the sheep. - I see.

580
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:00,346
You don't carry the sheep.

581
00:22:00,346 --> 00:22:03,646
- There's no need to use strength. - That's such foolish thinking.

582
00:22:03,646 --> 00:22:05,516
I've carried sheep before.

583
00:22:05,516 --> 00:22:06,716
Can we carry sheep?

584
00:22:06,786 --> 00:22:08,416
They're very heavy.

585
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,286
I'm surprised that you've carried them before.

586
00:22:10,286 --> 00:22:12,286
- I've carried them before. - You can carry them if you want.

587
00:22:13,316 --> 00:22:14,646
Go this way.

588
00:22:14,646 --> 00:22:16,816
- Let's go. - Herd them to one side.

589
00:22:16,886 --> 00:22:18,846
The sheep are very cute.

590
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:21,446
- Come here. - Ji Hyo, Seok Jin.

591
00:22:21,486 --> 00:22:22,716
They're looking at us.

592
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:24,586
- Come here. - They're looking at us.

593
00:22:24,586 --> 00:22:26,016
They're looking at us.

594
00:22:26,016 --> 00:22:27,946
- They're looking at us. - They're so cute.

595
00:22:28,016 --> 00:22:29,716
It's like they're challenging us.

596
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,586
It's okay because our color is similar to theirs.

597
00:22:31,586 --> 00:22:32,946
- I was born in the Year of Sheep. - They're so cute.

598
00:22:32,946 --> 00:22:34,146
We're wearing the same color.

599
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:35,286
- They're coming. - They're coming.

600
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:36,686
- Come here. - They're coming to eat.

601
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:37,946
That sheep looks like Kwang Soo.

602
00:22:37,946 --> 00:22:39,516
- One of us can do it. - Come this way.

603
00:22:39,516 --> 00:22:43,016
- Herd them on one side. - That's good.

604
00:22:43,016 --> 00:22:45,316
- Herd them to that side. - Go to that side.

605
00:22:45,316 --> 00:22:46,686
- Which side? - Let's go over there.

606
00:22:46,686 --> 00:22:47,686
Come here.

607
00:22:47,686 --> 00:22:50,086
- Come here, guys. - Come here.

608
00:22:50,086 --> 00:22:52,046
- Come here. - Let's go.

609
00:22:53,516 --> 00:22:55,446
Let's go.

610
00:22:56,586 --> 00:22:58,216
(More sheep follow them.)

611
00:22:58,216 --> 00:22:59,416
Shall we start the challenge?

612
00:22:59,716 --> 00:23:00,816
Come this way.

613
00:23:00,816 --> 00:23:01,846
(They get closer together.)

614
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:03,116
That sheep looks like Kwang Soo.

615
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:04,446
- One of us can do it. - Come this way.

616
00:23:04,446 --> 00:23:06,686
- Herd them. - Herd them on one side.

617
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:08,146
- That's good. - Herd them first.

618
00:23:08,146 --> 00:23:09,946
Send them to the shed right away.

619
00:23:09,946 --> 00:23:11,286
(They finally get a chance.)

620
00:23:11,286 --> 00:23:13,846
- Challenge. - Challenge.

621
00:23:13,946 --> 00:23:15,286
(They move forward.)

622
00:23:15,286 --> 00:23:16,946
- Let's go. - Challenge.

623
00:23:17,716 --> 00:23:19,286
- Let's go. - Guys.

624
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:21,186
- We're doing well. - Wait.

625
00:23:21,186 --> 00:23:22,816
- What do we do with that sheep? - Go.

626
00:23:24,086 --> 00:23:25,886
(The sheep move in a herd.)

627
00:23:26,216 --> 00:23:27,716
- Kwang Soo. - Gosh.

628
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:28,986
Gosh, Jae Seok.

629
00:23:29,316 --> 00:23:30,786
(Jae Seok falls on his bottom.)

630
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:32,446
- We're doing well. - Wait.

631
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:34,216
- What do we do with that sheep? - Go.

632
00:23:35,686 --> 00:23:36,986
(Falling)

633
00:23:37,786 --> 00:23:39,816
(He slips twice in a row.)

634
00:23:39,816 --> 00:23:41,416
- Kwang Soo. - Keep them together.

635
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:44,586
(The shepherds lose control of their bodies.)

636
00:23:44,586 --> 00:23:46,116
- Kwang Soo. - Keep them together.

637
00:23:46,316 --> 00:23:48,186
- Wait. - There's poop everywhere.

638
00:23:48,186 --> 00:23:50,046
- Look at this. - I think I slipped in their urine.

639
00:23:50,146 --> 00:23:51,886
- Be careful. - I slipped in their urine.

640
00:23:51,886 --> 00:23:52,916
- They're moving. - Kwang Soo.

641
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,016
Let's go.

642
00:23:54,346 --> 00:23:58,246
(The herd moves toward the exit.)

643
00:23:58,246 --> 00:24:00,516
(My dear sheep, let's go home.)

644
00:24:00,516 --> 00:24:02,016
- Go out. - Go out.

645
00:24:02,016 --> 00:24:03,586
- Everyone, get out. - Go out.

646
00:24:04,186 --> 00:24:05,316
We might make it.

647
00:24:05,316 --> 00:24:07,186
- They're leaving. - Keep going.

648
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,446
(It's time to go home.)

649
00:24:10,686 --> 00:24:12,316
- Keep going. - Go out.

650
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:14,946
- Go out 1 by 1. - Be careful.

651
00:24:14,946 --> 00:24:18,886
- You're getting stuck. Go slowly. - Be careful.

652
00:24:18,986 --> 00:24:20,916
(One sheep stays inside the fence.)

653
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:21,986
Go slowly.

654
00:24:21,986 --> 00:24:23,216
What about this sheep?

655
00:24:23,216 --> 00:24:24,586
- Come here. - We have one sheep left.

656
00:24:25,086 --> 00:24:26,986
- Come this way. - Take this sheep with you.

657
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,316
- Hey. - Don't go.

658
00:24:28,486 --> 00:24:29,516
Hey!

659
00:24:29,646 --> 00:24:31,616
- Come this way. - Take this sheep with you.

660
00:24:31,616 --> 00:24:33,346
(The sheep runs away.)

661
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,616
- No. - Get it!

662
00:24:35,746 --> 00:24:37,616
(The sheep wants to play alone.)

663
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:39,516
It knows how variety shows work.

664
00:24:40,116 --> 00:24:42,886
(They have an escapee.)

665
00:24:42,886 --> 00:24:44,216
It knows how variety shows work.

666
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,816
- Come here. - He's coming.

667
00:24:46,046 --> 00:24:47,216
Go back to your friends.

668
00:24:47,216 --> 00:24:49,416
- Come here. - Come this way.

669
00:24:49,846 --> 00:24:51,386
Jong Kook, carry him.

670
00:24:51,516 --> 00:24:52,986
No, lure him slowly.

671
00:24:53,446 --> 00:24:54,516
Come here.

672
00:24:54,516 --> 00:24:55,646
(The sheep is upset.)

673
00:24:55,646 --> 00:24:57,446
- Here. - Don't go that way.

674
00:24:57,446 --> 00:24:59,446
- It's not that way. - Go up there and block him.

675
00:24:59,716 --> 00:25:00,916
Don't go that way.

676
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:02,716
What's going on?

677
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:04,086
He's moving away.

678
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,486
- What's going on? - He's moving.

679
00:25:05,486 --> 00:25:06,646
- He's moving. - Get out.

680
00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:09,486
(He decides to leave due to their effort.)

681
00:25:10,716 --> 00:25:12,516
The exit to the left is open.

682
00:25:12,516 --> 00:25:14,116
- That's right. - Right.

683
00:25:14,116 --> 00:25:15,746
- Go out that way. - Go out.

684
00:25:16,446 --> 00:25:17,686
(The sheep goes out.)

685
00:25:17,686 --> 00:25:18,746
Let's go to the sheep shed.

686
00:25:18,986 --> 00:25:20,116
Where's the sheep shed?

687
00:25:20,446 --> 00:25:21,586
He's going in.

688
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,616
- They know where to go. - They're moving.

689
00:25:23,986 --> 00:25:25,316
They're already trained.

690
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:28,586
Go inside.

691
00:25:29,386 --> 00:25:30,516
- All right. - Did all go in?

692
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:33,416
- Go inside. - Close the door.

693
00:25:33,486 --> 00:25:35,616
- No. - Don't go that way.

694
00:25:35,986 --> 00:25:37,186
That's not the way.

695
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:40,346
(It's the 2nd escape.)

696
00:25:40,346 --> 00:25:41,446
Hey, hey.

697
00:25:41,586 --> 00:25:43,716
(The whole herd escape.)

698
00:25:43,846 --> 00:25:45,746
- Don't run away. - Stop.

699
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:47,946
(Did you think we were that easy?)

700
00:25:48,786 --> 00:25:49,886
Stay inside.

701
00:25:49,886 --> 00:25:51,786
Ji Hyo has to go inside with the food.

702
00:25:51,786 --> 00:25:53,316
- Go inside, Ji Hyo. - I'll go in.

703
00:25:53,316 --> 00:25:54,486
- All of us have to go in. - Wait.

704
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,616
We must lure them in first.

705
00:25:56,616 --> 00:25:59,686
- I'll go in first. - Sheep, it's time to eat.

706
00:25:59,686 --> 00:26:01,216
All we have to do is lure in the rest.

707
00:26:01,516 --> 00:26:02,686
Be quiet.

708
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,986
Guess what we have.

709
00:26:03,986 --> 00:26:05,486
- Here you go. - They'll come toward us.

710
00:26:05,486 --> 00:26:07,516
- Here you go. - Come here. Let's eat.

711
00:26:07,516 --> 00:26:09,046
- Let's eat. - Let's go in.

712
00:26:09,046 --> 00:26:10,716
- We should go in. - Let's go in.

713
00:26:10,716 --> 00:26:12,986
- Come here and eat. - We should go in.

714
00:26:13,186 --> 00:26:14,216
Don't go in yet.

715
00:26:14,216 --> 00:26:15,986
Wait until all the sheep are near us.

716
00:26:16,486 --> 00:26:19,116
- Let's eat. - We're trying to feed you.

717
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:20,746
Open the gate.

718
00:26:21,086 --> 00:26:22,386
Wait. Let's go in.

719
00:26:22,616 --> 00:26:25,086
- Open the gate. - They're coming in.

720
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,616
- Stop. - Wait a minute.

721
00:26:26,616 --> 00:26:28,786
- Go in. - In 3, 2.

722
00:26:28,786 --> 00:26:30,216
- Come here. - Go in.

723
00:26:30,216 --> 00:26:31,516
- One. - Come here.

724
00:26:31,516 --> 00:26:34,216
(The time is up.)

725
00:26:34,216 --> 00:26:36,386
- Come here. - They're leaving.

726
00:26:36,446 --> 00:26:38,816
(They run out without turning back.)

727
00:26:38,816 --> 00:26:40,216
- Come here now. - All the sheep are leaving.

728
00:26:40,216 --> 00:26:41,446
- Hey. - Hey.

729
00:26:41,716 --> 00:26:42,746
They're all leaving.

730
00:26:43,216 --> 00:26:44,346
My goodness.

731
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:47,146
- Where are you going? - This is difficult.

732
00:26:47,516 --> 00:26:48,916
It's not easy at all.

733
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:51,786
Are they trying to tease us?

734
00:26:52,586 --> 00:26:53,746
Ji Hyo.

735
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:54,946
(Look, Ji Hyo.)

736
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,286
Is this the kind of trip you wanted?

737
00:26:57,186 --> 00:26:58,286
What happened?

738
00:26:59,086 --> 00:27:00,916
(They're exhausted after the 1st 2 hours.)

739
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:02,646
That was so tiring.

740
00:27:02,646 --> 00:27:04,086
It's difficult.

741
00:27:04,386 --> 00:27:06,216
- It's not easy at all. - You failed the mission.

742
00:27:06,446 --> 00:27:08,016
- You seem happy that we failed. - It was difficult.

743
00:27:08,016 --> 00:27:09,346
You were very close.

744
00:27:09,346 --> 00:27:12,016
Five of you will still go in the water.

745
00:27:12,016 --> 00:27:13,786
- Fine. - We'll be doomed.

746
00:27:13,786 --> 00:27:15,016
- Let's just go in. - It's time...

747
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:17,886
- We'll go in together. - for the barbecue. Let's move on.

748
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,986
Let's go.

749
00:27:18,986 --> 00:27:20,186
- Barbecue. - Barbecue.

750
00:27:20,246 --> 00:27:22,116
- Let's go. - It's my favorite time.

751
00:27:22,116 --> 00:27:23,916
- I'm hungry. - We'll get barbecue.

752
00:27:24,516 --> 00:27:26,286
- We were so close. - Barbecue time.

753
00:27:27,716 --> 00:27:29,516
The sheep were so cute.

754
00:27:29,516 --> 00:27:31,916
- Right now, - I've never seen them in person.

755
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:35,646
Ji Hyo who suggested this trip is very upset.

756
00:27:35,646 --> 00:27:38,786
- It's not the trip she wanted. - She's been upset for a while.

757
00:27:38,846 --> 00:27:40,346
This isn't what I wanted.

758
00:27:40,346 --> 00:27:42,046
Here's what was scary.

759
00:27:42,046 --> 00:27:44,686
At first, Ji Hyo said that the sheep were very cute.

760
00:27:44,946 --> 00:27:46,986
When things didn't turn out well, she cursed at them.

761
00:27:46,986 --> 00:27:48,216
She said, "Are you a gangster?"

762
00:27:49,286 --> 00:27:50,416
I'm being serious.

763
00:27:50,646 --> 00:27:52,386
I think this rope is the problem.

764
00:27:52,616 --> 00:27:54,986
- It's a big problem. - What does it mean exactly?

765
00:27:55,086 --> 00:27:57,116
- It means we should become one. - The rope is...

766
00:27:57,116 --> 00:28:00,216
- soaked with sheep poop. - Really?

767
00:28:00,216 --> 00:28:02,216
Kwang Soo stepped on poop and slipped.

768
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:05,846
(During the sheep herding mission)

769
00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:07,446
- Kwang Soo. - Keep them together.

770
00:28:07,446 --> 00:28:08,746
There's poop everywhere.

771
00:28:08,886 --> 00:28:12,286
(The link is covered with sheep poop.)

772
00:28:13,386 --> 00:28:14,716
He fell on his bottom.

773
00:28:14,716 --> 00:28:16,686
I slipped on where the sheep pooped and peed.

774
00:28:16,686 --> 00:28:18,316
(He fell in sheep poop.)

775
00:28:18,516 --> 00:28:21,816
Kwang Soo can't help but attract poop.

776
00:28:22,986 --> 00:28:24,486
- He can't pass by poop. - Did you see him?

777
00:28:24,486 --> 00:28:26,186
There are two who slipped on poop.

778
00:28:26,216 --> 00:28:27,486
They're me and Kwang Soo.

779
00:28:27,486 --> 00:28:28,986
That's right.

780
00:28:29,516 --> 00:28:32,416
When will we take a beautiful trip that we want?

781
00:28:33,016 --> 00:28:34,416
- It's time for barbecue. - Without the cameras and shooting.

782
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:35,886
- We need to schedule it. - We'll eat barbecue soon.

783
00:28:35,886 --> 00:28:37,846
- We're going to have barbecue. - What?

784
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:39,786
- We're having barbecue, right? - That's right.

785
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:41,616
We won't get barbecue so easily.

786
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,886
- There's no way. - I hope I get some barbecue.

787
00:28:43,886 --> 00:28:46,816
Here's a mission for the barbecue party.

788
00:28:46,816 --> 00:28:48,146
- Okay. - First,

789
00:28:48,446 --> 00:28:51,316
Ji Hyo will write 10 ingredients...

790
00:28:51,316 --> 00:28:53,786
she wants for the barbecue.

791
00:28:53,786 --> 00:28:55,146
Don't include meat.

792
00:28:55,216 --> 00:28:57,016
- Ji Hyo likes ramyeon. - Right.

793
00:28:57,016 --> 00:28:58,786
- Do you know her well? - We need ramyeon.

794
00:28:58,786 --> 00:29:02,086
- These are for barbecue. - How about potatoes and such?

795
00:29:02,086 --> 00:29:04,286
- I have so much I want to eat. - Ramyeon and kimchi.

796
00:29:05,646 --> 00:29:07,086
How about a leaf of lettuce?

797
00:29:08,486 --> 00:29:10,586
- The list is ready. - How about chocolate chips?

798
00:29:11,186 --> 00:29:13,616
- Did you write down bread? - No.

799
00:29:13,746 --> 00:29:15,886
- We need some bread. - I'm hungry.

800
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:18,146
She wrote down the 10 ingredients.

801
00:29:18,886 --> 00:29:20,616
- Here's the mission. - Sure.

802
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:23,286
You have three minutes...

803
00:29:23,286 --> 00:29:26,886
to buy all 10 ingredients that Ji Hyo wrote down.

804
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:30,786
Here's the condition. Ji Hyo cannot move from the front.

805
00:29:30,786 --> 00:29:32,516
(Ji Hyo cannot step out of the designated area.)

806
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:35,386
Let's get started.

807
00:29:35,386 --> 00:29:37,946
- Let's go. - Ji Hyo has to stay at the counter.

808
00:29:38,086 --> 00:29:42,216
- Let's try to go fast. - We have to know what she picked.

809
00:29:42,216 --> 00:29:43,746
(They'll be awarded meat according to how many they get right.)

810
00:29:43,986 --> 00:29:46,746
- Go in the red square, Ji Hyo. - Let's get fish cake bar.

811
00:29:47,316 --> 00:29:48,646
- Are you ready? - Yes.

812
00:29:48,646 --> 00:29:49,846
- Do you remember them? - Haha.

813
00:29:49,846 --> 00:29:52,516
- Tell us, Ji Hyo. - Tangerine, rice, and mushrooms.

814
00:29:52,516 --> 00:29:53,816
- Tangerine. - Let's go this way.

815
00:29:53,816 --> 00:29:55,386
- Tangerine. - Tangerine's right here.

816
00:29:55,446 --> 00:29:56,986
- You can't move, Ji Hyo. - Chili peppers,

817
00:29:56,986 --> 00:29:58,986
- sweet potatoes, and potatoes. - Get set...

818
00:29:59,516 --> 00:30:01,286
- Tangerines. - And?

819
00:30:01,286 --> 00:30:02,786
You have three minutes. Get mushrooms.

820
00:30:02,786 --> 00:30:04,386
(They get lucky and find tangerines right away.)

821
00:30:04,516 --> 00:30:05,586
Weren't there also chili peppers?

822
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:07,746
- Chili peppers. - Here's garlic.

823
00:30:07,746 --> 00:30:09,586
- Garlic. - Garlic?

824
00:30:09,586 --> 00:30:10,916
(They find chili pepper, tangerines, and garlic.)

825
00:30:10,916 --> 00:30:12,646
- Get mushroom. - Here's king oyster mushroom.

826
00:30:12,646 --> 00:30:14,486
(They get chili pepper, garlic, mushrooms in the vegetable section.)

827
00:30:14,486 --> 00:30:16,686
- Mushrooms and what? - Garlic.

828
00:30:16,686 --> 00:30:18,116
- We have garlic. - Get snacks.

829
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:20,186
- Ramyeon. - Get kimchi.

830
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:22,086
- This one? - Yes, that one.

831
00:30:22,786 --> 00:30:24,646
- Get instant rice. - Is there rice?

832
00:30:24,646 --> 00:30:26,946
- Get tuna. - We don't have tuna or potatoes.

833
00:30:26,946 --> 00:30:29,746
(What?)

834
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:31,886
(Why would he get a whole sac?)

835
00:30:31,886 --> 00:30:32,986
Why would you get that, fool?

836
00:30:32,986 --> 00:30:35,186
- It's instant rice. - She means instant rice.

837
00:30:35,186 --> 00:30:36,646
Get instant rice.

838
00:30:36,646 --> 00:30:38,086
- Don't. - It's okay.

839
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,516
(I don't know anymore.)

840
00:30:39,516 --> 00:30:42,086
- Get instant rice. - She means instant rice.

841
00:30:42,086 --> 00:30:43,086
Where's potato?

842
00:30:43,086 --> 00:30:44,586
(Would we be able to do a proper barbecue?)

843
00:30:44,586 --> 00:30:46,186
- Get potatoes. - It's below here.

844
00:30:46,186 --> 00:30:48,286
- Here's sweet potato. - That's potato.

845
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:50,346
(They find potato and sweet potatoes together.)

846
00:30:50,346 --> 00:30:51,816
- I got potatoes. - Did you?

847
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,786
- One minute has passed. - Really?

848
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:54,916
What else?

849
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:56,646
- Hurry up. - Here's sweet potato.

850
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,886
- Get some snacks. - I see snacks.

851
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:00,746
- It's over there. - All right.

852
00:31:00,746 --> 00:31:02,086
(They look for snacks now.)

853
00:31:02,086 --> 00:31:04,186
Raise the rope.

854
00:31:04,186 --> 00:31:05,286
(He's so close.)

855
00:31:05,286 --> 00:31:06,646
Pull on the rope.

856
00:31:06,646 --> 00:31:08,386
(The link limits their movement.)

857
00:31:08,386 --> 00:31:10,286
- Hold on. - Sit down.

858
00:31:10,516 --> 00:31:11,586
(It's so tight.)

859
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:13,346
- Sit down. - You're done.

860
00:31:13,346 --> 00:31:15,186
- Please, get me that one. - That's enough.

861
00:31:15,186 --> 00:31:16,916
- I really like that one. - The rope is getting in the way.

862
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,086
(Snacks?)

863
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:19,886
Can I get the one next to it?

864
00:31:19,886 --> 00:31:21,886
- Get back. - Stop it. Come back.

865
00:31:21,886 --> 00:31:23,746
(He shows perfect teamwork with the lady.)

866
00:31:23,746 --> 00:31:26,116
- Raise the rope. - Didn't we get bread?

867
00:31:26,186 --> 00:31:28,186
- Where's tuna? - You have 30 seconds.

868
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:29,686
- We didn't get bread. - Get tuna.

869
00:31:29,686 --> 00:31:31,486
- Tuna's a hard one. - We need to find it.

870
00:31:31,486 --> 00:31:32,486
(The length of the rope is limited.)

871
00:31:32,486 --> 00:31:33,586
- We need tuna. - Get instant rice.

872
00:31:33,586 --> 00:31:35,586
- Where's tuna, ma'am? - Go.

873
00:31:35,586 --> 00:31:38,186
- Keep going. - Ask one of them.

874
00:31:38,186 --> 00:31:40,486
Excuse me. Can you throw me one?

875
00:31:40,486 --> 00:31:42,286
(She's like the 7th member of Running Man.)

876
00:31:42,286 --> 00:31:43,386
(Here's tuna.)

877
00:31:43,386 --> 00:31:45,616
- Get instant rice, too. - Thank you.

878
00:31:45,616 --> 00:31:46,686
Excuse me.

879
00:31:46,686 --> 00:31:48,716
- We have 10 seconds. - Can you throw me instant rice?

880
00:31:48,846 --> 00:31:50,186
- Throw it. Thank you. - Ten.

881
00:31:50,186 --> 00:31:51,946
- Bring it. - Can you throw me another one?

882
00:31:51,946 --> 00:31:54,016
(She comes to their aid again.)

883
00:31:54,016 --> 00:31:55,186
- This one. - Five.

884
00:31:55,316 --> 00:31:57,486
(Thank you, ma'am.)

885
00:31:57,486 --> 00:31:59,446
- Thank you. - Four, three...

886
00:31:59,446 --> 00:32:00,446
You're good.

887
00:32:00,446 --> 00:32:02,446
- Two. - Hold it.

888
00:32:02,446 --> 00:32:04,346
- Put it in. - We're good.

889
00:32:04,346 --> 00:32:05,686
(Time's over.)

890
00:32:05,986 --> 00:32:07,446
- I'm sorry. - Hey.

891
00:32:07,446 --> 00:32:10,716
How much sweet potatoes and rice did you get?

892
00:32:11,116 --> 00:32:12,586
- Potatoes. - Where's garlic?

893
00:32:12,586 --> 00:32:13,686
(They check the ingredients.)

894
00:32:13,686 --> 00:32:15,086
- It was right in front. - What about ramyeon?

895
00:32:15,086 --> 00:32:16,486
- We have it. - Did we get it?

896
00:32:16,486 --> 00:32:17,916
- We don't have ramyeon. - We missed it.

897
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:19,916
- We don't have it, right? - Why didn't we get it?

898
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:21,786
- Why didn't we get it? - I didn't even think of it.

899
00:32:21,786 --> 00:32:23,946
You are missing ramyeon. You got nine items correct.

900
00:32:23,946 --> 00:32:26,086
(They got 9 out of 10 ingredients.)

901
00:32:26,086 --> 00:32:29,686
You have earned five servings of Korean beef.

902
00:32:29,686 --> 00:32:30,816
- That's good enough. - We get five servings.

903
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:32,346
- We did well. - That's fine.

904
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:35,186
- I think we did pretty well. - We did.

905
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:36,646
It wasn't easy.

906
00:32:36,886 --> 00:32:37,946
(This is where they'll get meat.)

907
00:32:37,946 --> 00:32:40,146
We got a lot of good ones.

908
00:32:40,216 --> 00:32:41,286
Did we?

909
00:32:41,286 --> 00:32:42,816
(This is where they'll get meat.)

910
00:32:43,216 --> 00:32:44,846
(They earned the meat by completing the mission.)

911
00:32:44,846 --> 00:32:46,946
- I can already smell it. - There's meat.

912
00:32:46,946 --> 00:32:49,116
(They earned the meat by completing the mission.)

913
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:52,686
- It's Korean beef. - We need to get five servings.

914
00:32:52,686 --> 00:32:54,446
- It looks so good. - Right?

915
00:32:54,446 --> 00:32:56,446
- It does look good. - How many grams is two servings?

916
00:32:56,486 --> 00:32:58,386
It's 300g for 1 serving. You can get 5 servings.

917
00:32:58,386 --> 00:33:01,346
That's for 1 serving? How many grams is this? It's 200g.

918
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,446
(They try to measure 5 servings.)

919
00:33:03,446 --> 00:33:04,516
That looks good, too.

920
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:07,686
- Get some sirloin. - Let's get rib eye.

921
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:09,286
- This is 200g. - That doesn't look good.

922
00:33:09,286 --> 00:33:11,446
It sounds funny when you say, "sirloin".

923
00:33:11,446 --> 00:33:13,646
I like sirloin.

924
00:33:13,646 --> 00:33:16,186
- I mean... - What if I like it?

925
00:33:16,186 --> 00:33:17,186
(Grabbing)

926
00:33:17,186 --> 00:33:19,386
This looks so good.

927
00:33:19,386 --> 00:33:21,346
I didn't think we'd eat beef in Pyeongchang.

928
00:33:21,486 --> 00:33:23,686
- Thank you. - Thank you.

929
00:33:23,686 --> 00:33:24,686
Thank you.

930
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:29,286
(They head to the barbecue place.)

931
00:33:29,286 --> 00:33:32,586
(A resort in Daegwallyeong, Pyeongchang)

932
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:34,516
(This is the highlight of winter trips.)

933
00:33:34,516 --> 00:33:38,186
(It's barbecue time in Pyeongchang.)

934
00:33:38,186 --> 00:33:40,446
Can't we untie the rope while we eat?

935
00:33:40,446 --> 00:33:41,646
- We can untie it twice. - Let's untie it.

936
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:43,486
Let's untie it while we eat.

937
00:33:43,486 --> 00:33:44,986
- Let's do that. - We have two chances.

938
00:33:44,986 --> 00:33:47,486
- Let's untie it. - Seriously.

939
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:49,086
We need to untie it while we eat.

940
00:33:49,086 --> 00:33:51,216
Isn't it so much better without it?

941
00:33:51,216 --> 00:33:52,446
Yes.

942
00:33:52,446 --> 00:33:53,716
I'm getting excited.

943
00:33:53,746 --> 00:33:54,886
Can we eat now?

944
00:33:55,346 --> 00:33:57,686
- Let's grill the meat now. - I'll do it.

945
00:33:57,686 --> 00:33:58,686
- Sorry? - I'll do it.

946
00:33:58,686 --> 00:34:01,346
- Seok Jin, you... - You shouldn't, Seok Jin.

947
00:34:01,346 --> 00:34:02,916
He's known for being bad in grilling meat.

948
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,916
I'm so good.

949
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:06,986
I'll make kimchi jjigae.

950
00:34:06,986 --> 00:34:08,746
- Sure. - Let's make kimchi jjigae.

951
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,086
Get some meat.

952
00:34:10,086 --> 00:34:11,516
Meat...

953
00:34:13,016 --> 00:34:14,486
(He cooks each piece like a master.)

954
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:15,686
- Here. - Where's tuna?

955
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:17,316
(It's prime beef.)

956
00:34:17,316 --> 00:34:19,386
We have to eat it right away.

957
00:34:19,386 --> 00:34:21,386
It's done.

958
00:34:21,386 --> 00:34:23,586
(It looks so delicious that it might dance inside your mouth.)

959
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,516
Come here. Hey.

960
00:34:26,686 --> 00:34:28,886
(I'll take it, then.)

961
00:34:29,686 --> 00:34:31,686
(Swallowing)

962
00:34:31,856 --> 00:34:33,986
- Let's eat... - Open your mouth.

963
00:34:33,986 --> 00:34:35,586
(It turns the grumbling tiger...)

964
00:34:35,586 --> 00:34:38,356
(into a gentle sheep.)

965
00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:40,746
- Oh, dear. - Isn't it insane?

966
00:34:43,386 --> 00:34:44,986
Eat some meat first.

967
00:34:44,986 --> 00:34:46,286
(It's like something came alive...)

968
00:34:46,286 --> 00:34:47,586
(in my mouth.)

969
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:48,716
It's good.

970
00:34:48,716 --> 00:34:50,486
(It's like something came alive in my mouth.)

971
00:34:50,816 --> 00:34:53,216
- It looks good. - It's so good.

972
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:56,216
Let's see. Is it good?

973
00:34:56,216 --> 00:34:57,986
(They all fall for it.)

974
00:34:59,286 --> 00:35:01,116
It separates easily.

975
00:35:01,116 --> 00:35:04,516
(He's amazed. It's so juicy.)

976
00:35:05,086 --> 00:35:06,486
It's so good.

977
00:35:06,516 --> 00:35:09,016
It finally feels like we're on a trip.

978
00:35:09,016 --> 00:35:10,486
I agree.

979
00:35:10,486 --> 00:35:11,516
Really?

980
00:35:11,746 --> 00:35:12,986
Let's see what this is.

981
00:35:13,746 --> 00:35:15,116
- What is it? - Brisket?

982
00:35:15,386 --> 00:35:16,586
Brisket?

983
00:35:16,816 --> 00:35:19,746
Go ahead and grill some basket.

984
00:35:20,916 --> 00:35:22,086
How about grilling some bosket?

985
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:25,516
(The older members laugh...)

986
00:35:25,516 --> 00:35:26,586
(over old jokes.)

987
00:35:26,586 --> 00:35:28,646
That was seriously not funny.

988
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:31,786
(There's no age limit to going on trips, though.)

989
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:36,186
Why didn't anybody get ramyeon?

990
00:35:36,186 --> 00:35:38,086
We should have gotten some.

991
00:35:38,086 --> 00:35:39,646
- I'm glad we didn't. - Kwang Soo.

992
00:35:39,646 --> 00:35:42,016
- Yes? - Can you get some from a neighbour?

993
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,986
Stop talking about ramyeon.

994
00:35:43,986 --> 00:35:45,986
It's the highlight of outdoor trips.

995
00:35:45,986 --> 00:35:48,286
We have so many food. Why do we need ramyeon?

996
00:35:48,286 --> 00:35:49,786
(Isn't there any ramyeon?)

997
00:35:50,586 --> 00:35:52,386
- Do you want some ramyeon? - Yes.

998
00:35:52,386 --> 00:35:53,516
(Why would you even ask?)

999
00:35:53,516 --> 00:35:56,886
We'll give you a special utensil.

1000
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:59,286
If you eat with them, we'll give you one bag each.

1001
00:35:59,286 --> 00:36:00,286
What is it?

1002
00:36:01,146 --> 00:36:03,716
(What's the special utensil?)

1003
00:36:04,356 --> 00:36:06,216
(It looks like wooden sticks.)

1004
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:07,916
Come on.

1005
00:36:10,486 --> 00:36:12,286
(Everyone but Jong Kook wants ramyeon.)

1006
00:36:12,286 --> 00:36:17,186
(They can only eat with 100cm chopsticks.)

1007
00:36:17,786 --> 00:36:19,786
Let's stop the joke since we all laughed about it.

1008
00:36:20,716 --> 00:36:23,016
- Good joke. - How can we eat with it?

1009
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:25,356
- Is it even possible? - It is.

1010
00:36:25,356 --> 00:36:28,816
(It looks rather inconvenient.)

1011
00:36:29,446 --> 00:36:30,916
Are we supposed to eat with this?

1012
00:36:32,086 --> 00:36:33,386
Let me get started.

1013
00:36:33,386 --> 00:36:34,816
(Let's try eating with this.)

1014
00:36:34,816 --> 00:36:36,986
Be careful. Don't drop them.

1015
00:36:37,716 --> 00:36:38,746
I'm going to eat with this.

1016
00:36:38,746 --> 00:36:40,686
- I love the sirloin. - I'm going to do it, too.

1017
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:43,186
You need to use these, Seok Jin.

1018
00:36:43,446 --> 00:36:44,686
Kwang Soo's doing it.

1019
00:36:44,886 --> 00:36:47,286
(He sticks his tongue out.)

1020
00:36:47,286 --> 00:36:48,386
He's good.

1021
00:36:48,486 --> 00:36:49,686
It's good.

1022
00:36:49,886 --> 00:36:51,386
- He's good. - It's delicious.

1023
00:36:51,486 --> 00:36:53,116
(Should I try it?)

1024
00:36:53,116 --> 00:36:55,286
Be careful. Don't drop them.

1025
00:36:55,286 --> 00:36:58,516
(You should just eat. Don't close your eyes.)

1026
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:02,286
(They start sharing.)

1027
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:05,686
(They are being kind to each other without intending to.)

1028
00:37:05,686 --> 00:37:07,286
Is it good? I was pleasantly shocked.

1029
00:37:07,286 --> 00:37:08,786
(They harmonize due to large chopsticks.)

1030
00:37:08,786 --> 00:37:11,046
Kwang Soo, come and wash the vegetables with me.

1031
00:37:11,046 --> 00:37:13,516
Now? I don't like vegetables.

1032
00:37:13,516 --> 00:37:15,186
- Hey. - Are you going to wash them?

1033
00:37:15,186 --> 00:37:17,746
Eat some mushrooms. We can put them in kimchi jjigae.

1034
00:37:17,746 --> 00:37:19,786
(It's cold and dangerous out there.)

1035
00:37:19,786 --> 00:37:21,116
I'll make ramyeon instead.

1036
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:23,586
Come with me, Kwang Soo.

1037
00:37:24,646 --> 00:37:27,286
- Somebody has to make it. - Come with me, Kwang Soo.

1038
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,516
- I'll make it. - Hurry up.

1039
00:37:28,516 --> 00:37:29,886
- I'll make it. - I mean...

1040
00:37:29,886 --> 00:37:31,356
- Hurry up. - I'm the youngest...

1041
00:37:31,356 --> 00:37:32,586
(They were never this nice to me before.)

1042
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:33,586
Isn't it hard to chew?

1043
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:36,516
(12 minutes of Kwang Soo's slavery begins.)

1044
00:37:36,516 --> 00:37:38,016
Hold this.

1045
00:37:39,286 --> 00:37:41,046
Aren't these pre-washed?

1046
00:37:43,016 --> 00:37:44,356
Hurry up, Kwang Soo.

1047
00:37:44,356 --> 00:37:45,946
(You talk too much, Kwang Soo.)

1048
00:37:46,986 --> 00:37:48,856
You should have just sent me on my own.

1049
00:37:49,716 --> 00:37:50,716
(It's cold.)

1050
00:37:50,716 --> 00:37:53,286
- It's not hard. - Don't just wash one.

1051
00:37:53,286 --> 00:37:54,916
Wash the other ones, too.

1052
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:56,046
(Can't you wash them more carefully?)

1053
00:37:56,046 --> 00:37:57,286
- It's good, right? - Yes. Come.

1054
00:37:58,046 --> 00:38:00,086
(She punishes Kwang Soo for being lazy in the first place.)

1055
00:38:00,086 --> 00:38:02,086
- That's too much. - Is this good?

1056
00:38:02,086 --> 00:38:03,816
- Isn't this how you do it? - Come here.

1057
00:38:04,486 --> 00:38:05,716
You're dripping water.

1058
00:38:06,186 --> 00:38:07,186
Good.

1059
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:09,146
Why did you even come?

1060
00:38:10,116 --> 00:38:13,086
(Meanwhile at the tent...)

1061
00:38:13,086 --> 00:38:14,886
I'll make some good soup.

1062
00:38:15,686 --> 00:38:17,686
(Add kimchi.)

1063
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:19,386
(Add anything else you can get your hands on.)

1064
00:38:19,386 --> 00:38:21,186
Try tasting it.

1065
00:38:21,186 --> 00:38:22,946
(Add some gochujang to make it spicy and flavourful.)

1066
00:38:23,516 --> 00:38:24,646
It looks good.

1067
00:38:24,646 --> 00:38:26,356
(How does Haha's kimchi jjigae taste?)

1068
00:38:26,356 --> 00:38:27,646
It's like ramyeon.

1069
00:38:29,116 --> 00:38:30,516
Ramyeon's genuine taste...

1070
00:38:33,386 --> 00:38:36,016
(This won't work.)

1071
00:38:36,016 --> 00:38:38,286
Let's add some meat.

1072
00:38:38,286 --> 00:38:39,856
It doesn't taste like anything.

1073
00:38:39,886 --> 00:38:41,516
What about mushroom?

1074
00:38:41,516 --> 00:38:42,516
(They add mushroom.)

1075
00:38:43,786 --> 00:38:46,446
(His first attempt is unsuccessful.)

1076
00:38:47,446 --> 00:38:48,986
Should we add some meat?

1077
00:38:48,986 --> 00:38:50,446
(They add meat to revive it.)

1078
00:38:51,786 --> 00:38:52,946
It's so bad.

1079
00:38:53,686 --> 00:38:54,686
(Pondering)

1080
00:38:54,986 --> 00:38:56,746
We need to add this if nothing works out.

1081
00:39:00,216 --> 00:39:03,356
(Their last hope is the ramyeon seasoning.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1082
00:39:04,016 --> 00:39:06,856
(Would they be able to revive the taste with the seasoning?)

1083
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:15,786
(How is it? Would rice go well with it?)

1084
00:39:18,716 --> 00:39:20,646
It doesn't taste anything like kimchi jjigae.

1085
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:23,986
(Even the ramyeon seasoning can't save kimchi jjigae.)

1086
00:39:24,516 --> 00:39:27,816
(Everyone has given up, )

1087
00:39:27,816 --> 00:39:30,986
(It leaves me no choice, but to...)

1088
00:39:31,516 --> 00:39:34,116
- Jae Seok. - Let's put ham in it. We have it.

1089
00:39:36,986 --> 00:39:39,286
- That's spicy tuna. - It's spicy tuna.

1090
00:39:39,286 --> 00:39:41,746
(She completely empties the spicy tuna can.)

1091
00:39:42,016 --> 00:39:43,246
How can you put the spicy tuna?

1092
00:39:43,716 --> 00:39:46,446
What's the matter with you? Is there a secret mission?

1093
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:50,446
(She made a bold choice. Was there a reason for it?)

1094
00:39:50,446 --> 00:39:51,986
How can this work?

1095
00:39:55,886 --> 00:39:58,216
- This is tasty. - It's delicious.

1096
00:39:58,716 --> 00:39:59,716
Isn't it delicious?

1097
00:39:59,716 --> 00:40:01,386
(What a miracle.)

1098
00:40:01,386 --> 00:40:03,946
This almost tastes like tomato soup.

1099
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:05,146
This is so tasty.

1100
00:40:05,146 --> 00:40:06,316
(Kimchi, mushroom, beef, ramyeon, and spring onion aren't necessary.)

1101
00:40:06,316 --> 00:40:09,086
(You only need a can of spicy tuna.)

1102
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,516
(This looks very delicious.)

1103
00:40:11,516 --> 00:40:14,916
He hated ramyeon when we filmed "Family Outing". He still doesn't.

1104
00:40:15,016 --> 00:40:17,886
But I cooked all the stew he ate with ramyeon seasoning.

1105
00:40:18,146 --> 00:40:20,146
- He enjoyed them though, right? - He never figured it out.

1106
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:23,686
I cooked all of them with ramyeon seasoning.

1107
00:40:23,686 --> 00:40:24,856
It's delicious.

1108
00:40:25,116 --> 00:40:26,616
He could've eaten it pretending to be clueless.

1109
00:40:26,616 --> 00:40:28,586
It's tasty because the seasoning is in it.

1110
00:40:28,856 --> 00:40:29,916
It's all cooked. Let's eat.

1111
00:40:30,046 --> 00:40:32,816
- I didn't put a lot of seasoning. - It's cooked.

1112
00:40:32,816 --> 00:40:34,856
- No, it's not. - Let's eat before it's overcooked.

1113
00:40:34,856 --> 00:40:36,416
- What's wrong? - Leave it.

1114
00:40:36,416 --> 00:40:37,716
That's how I eat my ramyeon.

1115
00:40:37,716 --> 00:40:39,116
- But I'm cooking it. - Boil it more.

1116
00:40:39,316 --> 00:40:40,386
I will do it.

1117
00:40:40,386 --> 00:40:41,716
- Boil it more. - I will do it.

1118
00:40:41,716 --> 00:40:43,716
- Why did you put garlic? - Why did you put garlic?

1119
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:46,386
- It's delicious. - How can you put it in?

1120
00:40:46,386 --> 00:40:49,356
- Did she put garlic in it? - It will taste good.

1121
00:40:49,356 --> 00:40:51,286
- Ji Hyo. - Why are you ruining it?

1122
00:40:51,286 --> 00:40:52,646
Why did you put that in?

1123
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:54,786
I think it will be tasty with it.

1124
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:57,386
- Have you never cooked ramyeon? - Yes, I have.

1125
00:40:57,386 --> 00:40:58,416
(She gets a handful of hot chili peppers.)

1126
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:00,146
We need to eat ramyeon as it is.

1127
00:41:01,046 --> 00:41:02,356
- What? - Hey.

1128
00:41:03,116 --> 00:41:06,016
(His plan to taste it as it is goes out the window.)

1129
00:41:06,886 --> 00:41:08,646
You've never cooked ramyeon with toppings before, right?

1130
00:41:08,646 --> 00:41:10,516
(They can't complain since it's Ji Hyo's week.)

1131
00:41:11,216 --> 00:41:13,356
This is a culture shock.

1132
00:41:14,516 --> 00:41:15,886
Let's dig in.

1133
00:41:16,446 --> 00:41:17,886
- My gosh. - Here is the ramyeon.

1134
00:41:19,046 --> 00:41:21,816
Jong Kook, how can you not eat this?

1135
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:23,446
We have meat.

1136
00:41:23,486 --> 00:41:24,516
(He's always the first to eat.)

1137
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:27,216
You're so frustrating. Can you bring kimchi?

1138
00:41:27,216 --> 00:41:28,386
(He eats before it gets swollen.)

1139
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:29,416
Let's eat.

1140
00:41:30,216 --> 00:41:31,646
(Pushing)

1141
00:41:31,986 --> 00:41:34,146
(Please move aside.)

1142
00:41:34,516 --> 00:41:37,086
- Hey. - What?

1143
00:41:37,086 --> 00:41:38,246
(I don't have energy for any more struggles.)

1144
00:41:41,016 --> 00:41:42,016
This is delicious.

1145
00:41:42,986 --> 00:41:44,816
(The highlight of the trip is eating ramyeon.)

1146
00:41:44,816 --> 00:41:46,286
Ramyeon tastes great.

1147
00:41:46,946 --> 00:41:50,116
Ji Hyo, we could've put more hot chili peppers in.

1148
00:41:50,116 --> 00:41:51,786
(Ji Hyo was right after all.)

1149
00:41:52,356 --> 00:41:55,016
Since hot chili peppers are in it,

1150
00:41:55,216 --> 00:41:57,286
- Isn't it spicy? - it's spicy and delicious.

1151
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:00,416
She did a good job.

1152
00:42:00,716 --> 00:42:03,116
- Her decision was good. - Garlic suits well, too.

1153
00:42:03,116 --> 00:42:04,386
You thought well putting the garlic in.

1154
00:42:04,716 --> 00:42:06,616
(He's on the move.)

1155
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:10,216
(He tries to eat the sweet potato first.)

1156
00:42:10,216 --> 00:42:11,446
This is a hit.

1157
00:42:12,086 --> 00:42:13,646
How delicious.

1158
00:42:14,046 --> 00:42:15,046
It's hot.

1159
00:42:16,016 --> 00:42:18,786
He never eats with us. You saw it, right?

1160
00:42:18,986 --> 00:42:20,856
After eating the meat first, he ate ramyeon first.

1161
00:42:21,046 --> 00:42:23,946
After he finishes eating ramyeon, he reaches for this first.

1162
00:42:23,946 --> 00:42:25,916
He's eating them all.

1163
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:27,916
(Did everyone know about it?)

1164
00:42:28,486 --> 00:42:30,516
He comes here after he finishes eating ramyeon.

1165
00:42:31,046 --> 00:42:33,016
- You should take it out. - Excuse me.

1166
00:42:33,016 --> 00:42:36,016
I'm glad you're eating well, but don't trash the wrappers.

1167
00:42:36,746 --> 00:42:38,446
- Clean up afterwards. - Where would I throw them out?

1168
00:42:38,486 --> 00:42:40,856
- Put them here. - I did.

1169
00:42:40,946 --> 00:42:41,986
Are you happy?

1170
00:42:43,946 --> 00:42:46,946
My goodness. You're like a nagging mother-in-law.

1171
00:42:46,946 --> 00:42:48,746
You're like a nagging mother-in-law.

1172
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:52,086
- Hold on. - You're just like a mother-in-law.

1173
00:42:52,086 --> 00:42:54,356
Did you just disrespected every mother-in-law in Korea?

1174
00:42:54,356 --> 00:42:56,416
- I mean... - What's wrong with them?

1175
00:42:56,516 --> 00:42:58,786
- You just disrespected them. - That's not what I meant.

1176
00:42:58,786 --> 00:43:01,086
The mother-in-law association will be furious about this.

1177
00:43:01,086 --> 00:43:02,786
How do you plan to straighten things out with them?

1178
00:43:02,886 --> 00:43:05,786
- My mother is no joke. - My mom's also a mother-in-law.

1179
00:43:05,786 --> 00:43:07,646
My mom's also a mother-in-law.

1180
00:43:07,646 --> 00:43:10,216
I ask that you make a formal apology.

1181
00:43:10,216 --> 00:43:13,516
- Seok Jin. - We're in trouble because of you.

1182
00:43:13,516 --> 00:43:15,416
Disrespecting a family member is the worst.

1183
00:43:15,416 --> 00:43:18,446
I didn't mean any harm by my comment.

1184
00:43:18,746 --> 00:43:22,416
I would like to apologize to every mother-in-law in Korea.

1185
00:43:22,616 --> 00:43:26,016
- If I hurt or upset you in any way, - I'm sure they are hurt.

1186
00:43:26,016 --> 00:43:28,216
Please understand I didn't mean to.

1187
00:43:28,216 --> 00:43:31,146
- I would like to apologize to you. - Let's gather and protest.

1188
00:43:31,146 --> 00:43:32,646
Okay, this is good.

1189
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:35,286
- Sorry. I didn't mean to. - Apologize to them.

1190
00:43:35,286 --> 00:43:37,446
- My gosh. - Don't disrespect them.

1191
00:43:37,616 --> 00:43:39,246
- Let's not do that. - Kwang Soo, is there a plate?

1192
00:43:39,246 --> 00:43:40,416
If things go wrong...

1193
00:43:40,716 --> 00:43:42,986
- But this is so delicious. - I was totally framed.

1194
00:43:42,986 --> 00:43:44,586
My gosh. I was falsely charged.

1195
00:43:44,916 --> 00:43:47,186
- My mom is pacifist. - That's not true. Oh, dear.

1196
00:43:47,186 --> 00:43:48,286
(Ji Hyo's special dessert is the steamed bun.)

1197
00:43:48,286 --> 00:43:49,486
Steamed bun.

1198
00:43:50,716 --> 00:43:52,746
I want a red bean steamed bun.

1199
00:43:52,916 --> 00:43:56,446
By the way, isn't this plate part of the microwave?

1200
00:43:56,946 --> 00:43:58,486
Isn't this plate part of the microwave?

1201
00:43:58,486 --> 00:43:59,486
(Feeling guilty)

1202
00:43:59,486 --> 00:44:00,716
- I mean I thought you... - I couldn't...

1203
00:44:00,716 --> 00:44:02,916
- find a plate. - I wondered where you got this.

1204
00:44:02,916 --> 00:44:04,386
Did you pull it out from the microwave?

1205
00:44:04,386 --> 00:44:06,386
I thought it looked a bit fancy.

1206
00:44:06,516 --> 00:44:08,316
- How can a plate like this be here? - The microwave...

1207
00:44:08,316 --> 00:44:10,916
- Did you pull it out? - There were no plates.

1208
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:12,386
It's like the board of the microwave.

1209
00:44:12,386 --> 00:44:14,716
- She's a good housekeeper. - She is indeed.

1210
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:17,486
(Their meal started off with Korean beef and ended with steamed bun.)

1211
00:44:17,486 --> 00:44:19,446
This was a delicious meal.

1212
00:44:20,816 --> 00:44:21,816
(But the water is getting colder.)

1213
00:44:21,816 --> 00:44:23,886
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

1214
00:44:24,446 --> 00:44:26,586
- Did you enjoy your dinner? - Yes, we did.

1215
00:44:26,586 --> 00:44:27,686
We very much enjoyed it.

1216
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:30,916
Five of you will still face the ice shower.

1217
00:44:30,916 --> 00:44:32,486
- That's right. - Five of us?

1218
00:44:32,486 --> 00:44:35,486
It's the second mission to lower the number of members for the shower.

1219
00:44:35,646 --> 00:44:37,516
It's "Song Ji Hyo Speed Quiz".

1220
00:44:37,516 --> 00:44:39,316
(Song Ji Hyo Speed Quiz)

1221
00:44:39,316 --> 00:44:41,446
(What is "Song Ji Hyo Speed Quiz"?)

1222
00:44:41,446 --> 00:44:44,186
You will have two ice cubes in your mouth.

1223
00:44:44,646 --> 00:44:47,446
You will take turns to explain certain words.

1224
00:44:47,816 --> 00:44:49,686
Ji Hyo will have to guess the answers.

1225
00:44:49,686 --> 00:44:50,946
- I have to guess the answers? - Yes.

1226
00:44:50,946 --> 00:44:54,046
All the questions are related to Ji Hyo.

1227
00:44:54,086 --> 00:44:56,516
If you complete the mission, one of you will be exempted.

1228
00:44:56,516 --> 00:44:57,686
Okay.

1229
00:44:58,116 --> 00:45:00,286
(There are too many things to do on this trip.)

1230
00:45:00,286 --> 00:45:02,716
- Give me the ice. - Here you go.

1231
00:45:03,916 --> 00:45:05,846
(They put the ice cubes in their mouths.)

1232
00:45:05,846 --> 00:45:07,616
I can see the steam from your mouths.

1233
00:45:09,346 --> 00:45:10,486
(Let's hurry. It's cold.)

1234
00:45:10,486 --> 00:45:12,686
Hey, hurry. Hurry.

1235
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,116
Get ready.

1236
00:45:14,916 --> 00:45:16,416
Start.

1237
00:45:16,416 --> 00:45:18,586
("Song Ji Hyo Speed Quiz" starts.)

1238
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:19,986
(The answer is sleeping.)

1239
00:45:19,986 --> 00:45:23,716
(Sleeping is her talent and hobby.)

1240
00:45:23,716 --> 00:45:27,646
(You think of sleeping when you think about Ji Hyo.)

1241
00:45:28,746 --> 00:45:30,916
(Will she be able to figure out right away?)

1242
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:33,046
You like this a lot.

1243
00:45:33,046 --> 00:45:35,316
- You like this a lot. - Sleeping.

1244
00:45:35,586 --> 00:45:36,786
- Like this. - Sleeping.

1245
00:45:36,886 --> 00:45:39,016
(She gets the first question right.)

1246
00:45:39,646 --> 00:45:41,316
(Jong Kook is next. The answer is ice shower.)

1247
00:45:41,316 --> 00:45:44,616
You and I did this last week.

1248
00:45:45,486 --> 00:45:50,346
(Ji Hyo, you remember last week, right?)

1249
00:45:50,716 --> 00:45:55,246
(She was picked as the first runner and had the ice shower.)

1250
00:45:55,246 --> 00:46:00,086
(She picked him as the next runner and he faced the ice shower, too.)

1251
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:01,716
You and I did this last week.

1252
00:46:03,286 --> 00:46:04,616
We faced the water.

1253
00:46:06,216 --> 00:46:07,686
We are doing it today.

1254
00:46:07,686 --> 00:46:09,186
- Is it water shower? - No.

1255
00:46:10,816 --> 00:46:13,286
Shower... New Year...

1256
00:46:13,446 --> 00:46:15,316
I don't think she knows this word.

1257
00:46:15,786 --> 00:46:17,716
- You and I did this. - We will do it today.

1258
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:18,986
It's ice shower.

1259
00:46:20,186 --> 00:46:21,346
It's ice shower.

1260
00:46:21,646 --> 00:46:22,886
(She gets the second question correct.)

1261
00:46:22,886 --> 00:46:23,946
Hurry.

1262
00:46:23,946 --> 00:46:26,586
(The third one is curse.)

1263
00:46:26,946 --> 00:46:29,346
(This is too easy.)

1264
00:46:29,346 --> 00:46:31,716
You do this a lot.

1265
00:46:31,716 --> 00:46:33,646
(I do this a lot?)

1266
00:46:33,686 --> 00:46:34,916
(He's frustrated.)

1267
00:46:36,386 --> 00:46:38,046
It's curse.

1268
00:46:38,346 --> 00:46:40,246
(She gets the third question correct.)

1269
00:46:40,946 --> 00:46:43,116
(I will see you after the show.)

1270
00:46:44,986 --> 00:46:48,116
Cheer up, baby.

1271
00:46:48,846 --> 00:46:50,316
(We have a lot of memories with this song.)

1272
00:46:50,316 --> 00:46:51,416
It's Twice's song.

1273
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:52,646
Twice.

1274
00:46:52,646 --> 00:46:53,946
(Twice?)

1275
00:46:53,946 --> 00:46:56,086
(Then could it be...)

1276
00:46:56,216 --> 00:46:58,516
Cheer up, baby.

1277
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:00,486
(She was so sure the answer was "Shut it, baby.")

1278
00:47:00,486 --> 00:47:04,446
(Her answer made everyone speechless.)

1279
00:47:04,486 --> 00:47:05,686
It's Twice's song.

1280
00:47:06,316 --> 00:47:07,686
- It's a song. - It's "Cheer up".

1281
00:47:07,686 --> 00:47:09,746
(I won't get it wrong this time.)

1282
00:47:09,746 --> 00:47:11,986
(She gets the fourth question correct.)

1283
00:47:12,016 --> 00:47:13,516
(Ji Hyo the Thug)

1284
00:47:13,616 --> 00:47:14,786
Ji Hyo.

1285
00:47:14,816 --> 00:47:16,746
(This nickname suits you the best.)

1286
00:47:16,746 --> 00:47:19,486
(The answer is Ji Hyo the Thug.)

1287
00:47:19,486 --> 00:47:20,716
(Ji Hyo the Thug)

1288
00:47:20,716 --> 00:47:23,646
Ji Hyo, you are...

1289
00:47:23,646 --> 00:47:25,386
(He stutters since it's too cold.)

1290
00:47:25,386 --> 00:47:27,316
- Hurry. - Talk faster.

1291
00:47:27,316 --> 00:47:30,386
When you are mad, this is whom you turn into.

1292
00:47:30,386 --> 00:47:31,586
It starts with your name.

1293
00:47:31,786 --> 00:47:33,146
It starts with your name.

1294
00:47:33,146 --> 00:47:36,286
(If it starts with my name, it has to be...)

1295
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:37,416
Hey, you.

1296
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:38,986
(Ji Hyo the Thug appears.)

1297
00:47:39,046 --> 00:47:40,786
Why? What are you doing? Hold on.

1298
00:47:40,786 --> 00:47:42,886
(Ji Hyo the Thug appears.)

1299
00:47:43,316 --> 00:47:47,686
(Ji Hyo turns into a thug.)

1300
00:47:47,686 --> 00:47:49,286
(It's another side of her. Will she get it right?)

1301
00:47:49,286 --> 00:47:50,716
It has your name in it.

1302
00:47:50,716 --> 00:47:52,146
It's Ji Hyo the Thug.

1303
00:47:52,646 --> 00:47:54,046
It's Ji Hyo the Thug.

1304
00:47:54,516 --> 00:47:56,846
(She gets the fifth question right. Only the last question remains.)

1305
00:47:56,846 --> 00:47:58,786
What is it?

1306
00:47:58,786 --> 00:48:00,586
(It's the dance.)

1307
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:04,316
(It's the only dance she manages to do. They saw it more than 10 times.)

1308
00:48:05,746 --> 00:48:09,816
(The song came out 8 years ago, but it's still a new song for her.)

1309
00:48:10,416 --> 00:48:12,986
That dance is the only talent she has.

1310
00:48:13,316 --> 00:48:17,586
(It's her version of "Hot Issue". It is lovely to watch at any time.)

1311
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:19,616
(She will get this right away.)

1312
00:48:19,616 --> 00:48:21,786
- From my head to my toe - "Hot Issue"!

1313
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,046
- It's "Hot Issue". - That's right.

1314
00:48:24,286 --> 00:48:25,346
What's wrong with me?

1315
00:48:25,386 --> 00:48:26,516
Mission success.

1316
00:48:26,516 --> 00:48:27,916
(She successfully answered 6 questions within 1 minute.)

1317
00:48:27,916 --> 00:48:29,116
Mission success.

1318
00:48:29,116 --> 00:48:31,016
(Ji Hyo is the best!)

1319
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,186
(She is indeed the best player of them all.)

1320
00:48:32,186 --> 00:48:33,586
- We did it. - We sure did.

1321
00:48:33,916 --> 00:48:37,646
The number of members who will face the ice shower...

1322
00:48:38,346 --> 00:48:39,516
went down to four.

1323
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:41,346
- That's great. - Nice.

1324
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:42,816
- Great. - Let's move to the next place.

1325
00:48:42,816 --> 00:48:44,216
Let's go.

1326
00:48:45,816 --> 00:48:47,916
(Ji Hyo's Week)

1327
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:52,946
(They move to have the campfire.)

1328
00:48:54,746 --> 00:48:58,616
(They have the campfire at late night in Pyeongchang.)

1329
00:48:58,616 --> 00:48:59,916
- Everyone. - Yes?

1330
00:48:59,916 --> 00:49:02,386
Do you like the trip Ji Hyo prepared for you?

1331
00:49:02,446 --> 00:49:04,516
- Can you get rid of the rope? - The trip...

1332
00:49:04,516 --> 00:49:07,286
- It will be much better without it. - You're right.

1333
00:49:07,316 --> 00:49:08,516
You are united as one.

1334
00:49:08,716 --> 00:49:11,916
It's the highlight of the trip. It's the campfire.

1335
00:49:12,286 --> 00:49:14,046
It's time for "I'm Sorry, I'm Thankful, I Love You".

1336
00:49:14,046 --> 00:49:16,616
(It's time for "I'm Sorry, I'm Thankful, I Love You".)

1337
00:49:16,616 --> 00:49:17,786
"I'm Sorry, I'm Thankful, I Love You"?

1338
00:49:17,786 --> 00:49:19,586
(What is "I'm Sorry, I'm Thankful, I Love You"?)

1339
00:49:19,616 --> 00:49:21,616
I'm sorry I came late.

1340
00:49:22,186 --> 00:49:23,586
Thank you for working hard today.

1341
00:49:23,986 --> 00:49:25,016
I love you.

1342
00:49:25,016 --> 00:49:27,216
(They have to express such feelings towards each other.)

1343
00:49:27,216 --> 00:49:29,616
We will now begin "I'm Sorry, I'm Thankful, I Love You".

1344
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:32,846
Ji Hyo will pick two members.

1345
00:49:32,846 --> 00:49:34,646
- I will? - Ji Hyo's not playing?

1346
00:49:34,646 --> 00:49:36,516
Ji Hyo has to play, too. We are six people.

1347
00:49:36,686 --> 00:49:38,086
Should I do it with my junior, Seok Jin?

1348
00:49:38,286 --> 00:49:40,716
- I pick Jae Seok and Seok Jin. - I'll go with Seok Jin.

1349
00:49:40,716 --> 00:49:41,886
Okay.

1350
00:49:42,016 --> 00:49:44,516
- I'll go with Seok Jin. - He needs to be taught a lesson.

1351
00:49:44,616 --> 00:49:45,686
You're supposed to be my junior.

1352
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,316
- I got these for you two. - What is that?

1353
00:49:48,716 --> 00:49:50,016
You have to wear these.

1354
00:49:51,316 --> 00:49:55,386
(What is that for?)

1355
00:49:55,386 --> 00:49:57,116
There's no way of avoiding eye contact this way.

1356
00:49:57,746 --> 00:49:59,286
You have to make eye contact from up close.

1357
00:49:59,286 --> 00:50:00,986
(It's a tool that will fix their eyes.)

1358
00:50:00,986 --> 00:50:02,746
- Come over here. - Gosh.

1359
00:50:03,046 --> 00:50:05,116
You won't be able to avoid eye contact unless you close your eyes.

1360
00:50:05,116 --> 00:50:06,186
- Are you ready? - Yes.

1361
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:07,386
(They begin.)

1362
00:50:07,386 --> 00:50:09,316
- Do you want to go first? - Should I?

1363
00:50:09,486 --> 00:50:10,616
The junior may start first.

1364
00:50:11,486 --> 00:50:13,146
I've been meaning to tell you this.

1365
00:50:14,046 --> 00:50:15,846
When we have get-togethers,

1366
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,186
I wonder if I have to pay the bill since I'm the oldest.

1367
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,046
I wonder if I have to pay the bill.

1368
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:25,046
(Stingy Seok Jin says he's sorry.)

1369
00:50:25,046 --> 00:50:26,686
- He is serious. - I wonder...

1370
00:50:27,016 --> 00:50:30,816
if I have to pay or not. I worried about that a lot.

1371
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:34,846
When you pay the bill, I...

1372
00:50:34,946 --> 00:50:36,586
Seok Jin loves going to the washroom.

1373
00:50:37,616 --> 00:50:39,986
I should've said, "I'll get it, Jae Seok."

1374
00:50:40,616 --> 00:50:45,246
When you paid the bill, I said, "Thanks for buying."

1375
00:50:45,746 --> 00:50:48,686
On my way home, I thought to myself whether I should've paid the bill.

1376
00:50:48,686 --> 00:50:50,346
- He really is a junior. - But...

1377
00:50:50,346 --> 00:50:54,016
- Since you're the senior and all, - Right.

1378
00:50:54,016 --> 00:50:56,146
I thought that's why you paid the bill.

1379
00:50:56,146 --> 00:50:58,486
I'm sorry about that.

1380
00:50:58,486 --> 00:51:00,986
- You do pay the bill sometimes. - It's okay. And...

1381
00:51:00,986 --> 00:51:02,516
(This time, Jae Seok says he's sorry.)

1382
00:51:02,516 --> 00:51:05,746
- I introduced you to your wife. - Right.

1383
00:51:05,746 --> 00:51:07,846
You do know that now is the time to say that you're sorry, right?

1384
00:51:08,516 --> 00:51:09,816
I'm sorry to your wife.

1385
00:51:12,016 --> 00:51:13,386
But not to me?

1386
00:51:13,816 --> 00:51:15,986
- I'm sorry to your wife. - You must feel sorry for me.

1387
00:51:15,986 --> 00:51:18,246
She made the wrong decision because of me.

1388
00:51:18,246 --> 00:51:21,516
- I'm sorry to your wife. - If you knew the details,

1389
00:51:21,516 --> 00:51:23,846
- you'd feel sorry. - I feel sorry to your wife.

1390
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:28,346
And you were the one who gave me...

1391
00:51:28,616 --> 00:51:32,016
- the nickname, Big Nose. - That's right.

1392
00:51:32,216 --> 00:51:36,046
It's been over 20 years since I made my debut...

1393
00:51:36,346 --> 00:51:39,346
and that is my only nickname. So I thank you.

1394
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,116
- Thanks for giving me a character. - This is heartwarming.

1395
00:51:42,116 --> 00:51:43,586
I remember. I think it was the second episode.

1396
00:51:43,586 --> 00:51:44,916
- That's right. - Yes.

1397
00:51:47,846 --> 00:51:49,286
(He gave him that nickname on the first episode.)

1398
00:51:49,286 --> 00:51:50,586
You have a pretty big nose.

1399
00:51:52,086 --> 00:51:54,046
- That's right. - I remember that.

1400
00:51:54,046 --> 00:51:56,746
- You called me, Big Nose. - Right.

1401
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:59,016
After that, the whole country knew me as Big Nose.

1402
00:51:59,016 --> 00:52:02,616
Your DJ name for your radio show is "Nose DJ".

1403
00:52:02,616 --> 00:52:05,246
- I got that from Big Nose. - Right.

1404
00:52:05,346 --> 00:52:07,246
- Thanks for that. - You don't have to thank me.

1405
00:52:07,246 --> 00:52:08,746
- Thank you. - It's nothing.

1406
00:52:09,216 --> 00:52:10,486
I...

1407
00:52:10,986 --> 00:52:12,616
I'm thankful that...

1408
00:52:12,916 --> 00:52:14,516
your wife is happy with you.

1409
00:52:15,516 --> 00:52:17,316
- What? - What does that mean?

1410
00:52:17,316 --> 00:52:19,416
- Why would you thank her for that? - What's that supposed to mean?

1411
00:52:19,416 --> 00:52:20,416
I'm really thankful...

1412
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:23,346
- that you and your wife are happy. - Why would you be thankful?

1413
00:52:23,346 --> 00:52:25,116
If you knew the situation I'm in, you wouldn't be.

1414
00:52:25,316 --> 00:52:26,986
- I envy you. - I'm really thankful.

1415
00:52:26,986 --> 00:52:30,386
(Seok Jin is as bold as the size of his nose.)

1416
00:52:30,386 --> 00:52:33,316
Right. Anyway, I remember when...

1417
00:52:33,516 --> 00:52:35,816
you used to live in Bbalaegol...

1418
00:52:35,816 --> 00:52:37,646
- You used to live in Gao-ri. - Right.

1419
00:52:37,786 --> 00:52:41,116
- We met on the number 725 bus. - That's right.

1420
00:52:41,146 --> 00:52:44,246
- We've known each other since then. - We go way back.

1421
00:52:44,246 --> 00:52:47,916
Right. But I've never said this to you all this time.

1422
00:52:47,946 --> 00:52:49,686
I'll take this chance to say it.

1423
00:52:50,246 --> 00:52:51,346
I love you.

1424
00:52:51,346 --> 00:52:53,516
(He confesses his love for Jae Seok.)

1425
00:52:53,516 --> 00:52:56,786
(I love you, Jae Seok.)

1426
00:52:56,786 --> 00:52:57,986
(Oh, gosh.)

1427
00:52:57,986 --> 00:53:00,286
I'm saying it for the first time in 20 something years.

1428
00:53:00,346 --> 00:53:02,086
I don't usually say this.

1429
00:53:02,086 --> 00:53:07,516
We've known each other since we were in our early 20s.

1430
00:53:08,346 --> 00:53:09,516
That's right.

1431
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:15,146
(After 25 years of time, they're still together.)

1432
00:53:15,146 --> 00:53:21,916
(May the two be together for a long time.)

1433
00:53:21,916 --> 00:53:26,616
(I'm inside you and you're inside me.)

1434
00:53:26,616 --> 00:53:30,146
Now that you said that, I'll say it, too.

1435
00:53:30,586 --> 00:53:32,346
I love you, too.

1436
00:53:33,186 --> 00:53:34,416
Okay.

1437
00:53:35,716 --> 00:53:41,786
(I love you, Seok Jin.)

1438
00:53:43,786 --> 00:53:45,346
- This is nice. - I love you.

1439
00:53:45,346 --> 00:53:48,786
(Let me give you a hug, Jae Seok.)

1440
00:53:48,786 --> 00:53:50,986
(I don't know about that.)

1441
00:53:50,986 --> 00:53:54,246
(Jae Seok killed the mood.)

1442
00:53:55,086 --> 00:53:56,746
Seok Jin was about to hug you.

1443
00:53:57,016 --> 00:54:00,186
- Why would you reject him? - It's awkward now.

1444
00:54:00,186 --> 00:54:01,286
(Let's stop here so people won't feel cringy.)

1445
00:54:01,286 --> 00:54:03,246
- This is so awkward. - It sure is.

1446
00:54:03,246 --> 00:54:05,346
- We never talked like this. - You're right.

1447
00:54:06,146 --> 00:54:08,786
- We never said these things before. - We met on the number 725 bus.

1448
00:54:08,786 --> 00:54:11,246
- Haha and Ji Hyo will go now. - I have nothing to say to her.

1449
00:54:11,246 --> 00:54:12,916
(Up next are Ji Hyo and Haha.)

1450
00:54:13,146 --> 00:54:15,586
- It's Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo is...

1451
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,586
the host of today's episode.

1452
00:54:18,446 --> 00:54:19,486
- That's right. - Ji Hyo.

1453
00:54:20,846 --> 00:54:23,486
Do you remember when we used to be in a love triangle?

1454
00:54:24,786 --> 00:54:26,446
That's such a long time ago.

1455
00:54:26,446 --> 00:54:29,916
You don't seem to remember. You, Gary, and I were in a love triangle.

1456
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:30,986
(That was such a long time ago.)

1457
00:54:31,716 --> 00:54:33,216
Ji Hyo is...

1458
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:34,846
so pretty.

1459
00:54:36,016 --> 00:54:39,846
(Haha made Gary nervous seven years ago.)

1460
00:54:39,846 --> 00:54:42,516
(Is it true that you have absolutely no feelings for Haha?)

1461
00:54:42,516 --> 00:54:43,686
(Yes.)

1462
00:54:43,686 --> 00:54:45,216
(It was a lie.)

1463
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:47,246
In what ways is Haha better than me?

1464
00:54:47,246 --> 00:54:49,716
That's not correct. It's really not.

1465
00:54:49,716 --> 00:54:51,146
(There was a love triangle seven years ago.)

1466
00:54:51,146 --> 00:54:53,386
- That was seven years ago. - I...

1467
00:54:53,386 --> 00:54:55,216
(I...)

1468
00:54:55,216 --> 00:54:57,446
(You felt sorry about that?)

1469
00:54:57,446 --> 00:55:00,516
- It's been a long time since then. - I'm sorry...

1470
00:55:01,516 --> 00:55:02,586
I married Byul.

1471
00:55:02,586 --> 00:55:03,916
(I'm sorry I married Byul.)

1472
00:55:03,916 --> 00:55:05,046
Why would you be sorry?

1473
00:55:06,246 --> 00:55:08,086
- Why would you be sorry about that? - Why would you be sorry?

1474
00:55:08,086 --> 00:55:09,486
- Why would you be sorry? - If it was okay with you,

1475
00:55:09,486 --> 00:55:10,816
I could have made you my girlfriend.

1476
00:55:12,346 --> 00:55:13,516
This is funny.

1477
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:15,316
Haha.

1478
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,716
Do you remember when we went to Dongbaek Island for shooting?

1479
00:55:19,186 --> 00:55:21,346
- It was in the early days. - Right. We went there.

1480
00:55:21,346 --> 00:55:23,046
When we were there,

1481
00:55:23,216 --> 00:55:25,716
I was overzealous...

1482
00:55:26,016 --> 00:55:28,586
and wasn't communicating with other members.

1483
00:55:28,586 --> 00:55:32,516
I didn't know how to talk to other people. I had a closed mind.

1484
00:55:32,516 --> 00:55:36,086
At the end of the shooting,

1485
00:55:36,146 --> 00:55:38,946
I saw you and felt sorry.

1486
00:55:39,016 --> 00:55:42,586
When I said I was sorry...

1487
00:55:42,586 --> 00:55:48,146
(When she apologized to Haha...)

1488
00:55:48,146 --> 00:55:49,786
You said it was okay.

1489
00:55:49,786 --> 00:55:51,816
(He told her it was all right.)

1490
00:55:51,816 --> 00:55:53,346
- You're sorry? - I'm sorry.

1491
00:55:53,346 --> 00:55:55,016
I'm just really sorry.

1492
00:55:55,016 --> 00:55:58,846
(What happened in the past was still troubling her.)

1493
00:55:58,846 --> 00:56:01,486
You're apologizing for what happened seven years ago?

1494
00:56:02,316 --> 00:56:03,686
She can be strange like that.

1495
00:56:03,686 --> 00:56:04,946
(It's late, but I wanted to say it.)

1496
00:56:04,946 --> 00:56:06,186
Ji Hyo.

1497
00:56:06,216 --> 00:56:09,046
You have loyalty.

1498
00:56:09,146 --> 00:56:12,316
We didn't work out but...

1499
00:56:13,046 --> 00:56:14,716
- Stop that. - But really...

1500
00:56:14,716 --> 00:56:16,846
- What are you talking about? - We don't even remember that.

1501
00:56:17,316 --> 00:56:20,346
Anyway, Ji Hyo...

1502
00:56:21,016 --> 00:56:23,716
It must've been hard because of me.

1503
00:56:23,716 --> 00:56:26,146
- Why would she be? - What are you talking about?

1504
00:56:26,146 --> 00:56:27,946
Especially when I got married...

1505
00:56:29,216 --> 00:56:30,616
Ji Hyo.

1506
00:56:30,616 --> 00:56:33,216
Thanks for letting me go so that I could be happy.

1507
00:56:33,216 --> 00:56:35,846
(Thanks for letting me go so I can be happy.)

1508
00:56:35,846 --> 00:56:37,816
You do know that we used to be in a love triangle, right?

1509
00:56:37,816 --> 00:56:39,246
We were famous for that.

1510
00:56:39,246 --> 00:56:41,586
- This is what Haha did on "X-Man". - That's right.

1511
00:56:41,586 --> 00:56:43,746
- He was the playboy of "X-Man". - Right.

1512
00:56:44,386 --> 00:56:49,286
Okay. I'm thankful that...

1513
00:56:49,516 --> 00:56:51,046
Byul made you get it together.

1514
00:56:51,946 --> 00:56:54,146
It's too early to say he's gotten it all together.

1515
00:56:54,646 --> 00:56:55,946
Ji Hyo.

1516
00:56:55,946 --> 00:56:57,646
(Haha is sincere now.)

1517
00:56:57,646 --> 00:57:00,286
We guys can be insensitive.

1518
00:57:00,846 --> 00:57:03,046
We couldn't take care of you that well.

1519
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:06,716
We're not good at that since we're all guys.

1520
00:57:06,716 --> 00:57:08,086
It must've been really hard on her.

1521
00:57:09,846 --> 00:57:13,516
Thank you for putting up with us...

1522
00:57:13,516 --> 00:57:16,986
and staying by our side for seven years.

1523
00:57:16,986 --> 00:57:18,646
- I love you. - It's not an easy thing to do.

1524
00:57:18,646 --> 00:57:21,216
(Thank you and I love you.)

1525
00:57:21,386 --> 00:57:27,116
(Ji Hyo has always been cheerful. We love you so much.)

1526
00:57:27,116 --> 00:57:28,286
Haha.

1527
00:57:29,786 --> 00:57:33,216
I'm a very lacking person.

1528
00:57:34,216 --> 00:57:36,286
I did try to become friends.

1529
00:57:36,616 --> 00:57:39,416
You stayed by my side for all the seven years.

1530
00:57:39,986 --> 00:57:41,746
Thank you and I love you.

1531
00:57:42,046 --> 00:57:43,946
I love you.

1532
00:57:44,386 --> 00:57:46,086
You do know that we used to be in a love triangle, right?

1533
00:57:46,086 --> 00:57:47,416
Stop it now.

1534
00:57:47,416 --> 00:57:49,616
Stop it. Gosh.

1535
00:57:51,986 --> 00:57:55,516
Yes. Let's have Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo go next.

1536
00:57:55,516 --> 00:57:56,846
- Yes. - Kwang Soo and I?

1537
00:57:57,146 --> 00:57:58,946
Kwang Soo will start crying soon.

1538
00:57:59,846 --> 00:58:01,516
- Kwang Soo can do that. - Not at all.

1539
00:58:01,516 --> 00:58:02,986
I saw him at the awards ceremony.

1540
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:06,186
- He really is an actor. - He can start the waterworks fast.

1541
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:08,316
For seven years,

1542
00:58:09,646 --> 00:58:11,416
even when you're a woman,

1543
00:58:12,416 --> 00:58:16,316
I grabbed you by the hair, kicked you, and punched you in the stomach.

1544
00:58:16,316 --> 00:58:18,046
(I'm sorry I did mean things to you.)

1545
00:58:19,846 --> 00:58:26,286
(He didn't go easy on her to make this show funny.)

1546
00:58:26,286 --> 00:58:33,116
(They were like realistic siblings.)

1547
00:58:34,086 --> 00:58:39,716
(He did get beaten up from time to time, though.)

1548
00:58:41,486 --> 00:58:42,586
I'm sorry.

1549
00:58:42,586 --> 00:58:47,446
(I'm sorry about that, Ji Hyo.)

1550
00:58:47,446 --> 00:58:49,416
Don't be, Kwang Soo.

1551
00:58:50,516 --> 00:58:53,486
I felt more comfortable around you than the others,

1552
00:58:55,016 --> 00:58:57,686
and I behaved a bit carelessly towards you.

1553
00:58:58,516 --> 00:58:59,616
So...

1554
00:59:00,946 --> 00:59:02,516
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

1555
00:59:02,516 --> 00:59:05,286
(She apologizes as well.)

1556
00:59:06,416 --> 00:59:07,786
Six years ago,

1557
00:59:08,816 --> 00:59:12,386
you called me out and bought me bori gulbi.

1558
00:59:13,786 --> 00:59:16,146
When I moved, you bought me an electric fan.

1559
00:59:17,816 --> 00:59:20,586
At times, you sent me text messages...

1560
00:59:20,986 --> 00:59:23,516
to congratulate me...

1561
00:59:23,516 --> 00:59:26,686
and encourage me, so thank you.

1562
00:59:27,516 --> 00:59:31,346
Three years ago, when I left home after arguing with my mom...

1563
00:59:31,346 --> 00:59:32,486
What?

1564
00:59:33,586 --> 00:59:37,716
You said I could come to your place because I had nowhere to go.

1565
00:59:37,716 --> 00:59:39,486
Thank you for saying that.

1566
00:59:41,016 --> 00:59:43,516
Is this my cue to say I love her?

1567
00:59:44,686 --> 00:59:47,446
(Something seems very strange and inappropriate.)

1568
00:59:47,446 --> 00:59:48,786
Wait a minute.

1569
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:51,046
Was something going on between you two?

1570
00:59:51,186 --> 00:59:53,916
How many people are in love with Ji Hyo?

1571
00:59:53,916 --> 00:59:54,986
(Is that why they fought often?)

1572
00:59:55,986 --> 01:00:00,846
(You get closer as you fight.)

1573
01:00:00,846 --> 01:00:07,946
(Were all those fights simply lovers' quarrels?)

1574
01:00:09,746 --> 01:00:11,086
- That's not it. - No.

1575
01:00:11,246 --> 01:00:13,186
I ended up not going to his place.

1576
01:00:13,186 --> 01:00:15,016
- You didn't go? - No, I didn't.

1577
01:00:15,016 --> 01:00:16,316
He told me to come.

1578
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:19,386
I invited her because I was away from home for a shoot.

1579
01:00:19,586 --> 01:00:21,916
- She didn't come as I wasn't there. - Tell her you love her.

1580
01:00:21,916 --> 01:00:23,086
It felt strange back then, too.

1581
01:00:23,146 --> 01:00:24,486
Tell her you love her.

1582
01:00:24,886 --> 01:00:29,146
You're like a sister to me. I love you.

1583
01:00:29,146 --> 01:00:31,186
(Thank you for being a sister to me. I love you.)

1584
01:00:31,186 --> 01:00:33,886
I'm thankful that you're there for me,

1585
01:00:33,886 --> 01:00:38,116
(They're always there for each other.)

1586
01:00:38,116 --> 01:00:41,086
(Thank you and I love you.)

1587
01:00:41,146 --> 01:00:44,716
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo love each other like family.)

1588
01:00:46,186 --> 01:00:48,786
- It's Seok Jin's turn with her. - Let's stop.

1589
01:00:48,786 --> 01:00:50,516
- Come here. - Seok Jin should have his turn.

1590
01:00:50,516 --> 01:00:51,516
He's the last one.

1591
01:00:51,516 --> 01:00:53,586
- You're the main member today. - This is the last time.

1592
01:00:53,846 --> 01:00:55,446
- You like it, don't you? - Don't be shy.

1593
01:00:55,446 --> 01:00:57,146
I don't like it.

1594
01:00:57,146 --> 01:00:58,916
Ji Hyo doesn't like it.

1595
01:00:59,586 --> 01:01:03,886
Ji Hyo, this is my opinion,

1596
01:01:04,216 --> 01:01:07,386
and the other members agree because we've talked about it a lot.

1597
01:01:07,386 --> 01:01:10,416
When other actresses are on the show,

1598
01:01:10,486 --> 01:01:12,986
we called you unlucky only for fun...

1599
01:01:12,986 --> 01:01:15,116
and said you're ugly.

1600
01:01:15,516 --> 01:01:16,646
You know we don't mean it, right?

1601
01:01:16,986 --> 01:01:19,446
It always bothered me.

1602
01:01:19,446 --> 01:01:23,516
We all talked about how sorry we felt towards you.

1603
01:01:23,516 --> 01:01:25,686
However, we never had the chance to bring it up to you.

1604
01:01:25,846 --> 01:01:28,586
I hope you know that we didn't mean it. I'm very sorry.

1605
01:01:28,646 --> 01:01:30,416
We were only playing.

1606
01:01:30,446 --> 01:01:33,716
You know that it was only to be funny, right?

1607
01:01:33,716 --> 01:01:35,486
(The members' favorite actress is Ji Hyo.)

1608
01:01:35,486 --> 01:01:37,716
You're the eldest one...

1609
01:01:37,946 --> 01:01:39,516
among the members.

1610
01:01:39,516 --> 01:01:40,746
(Ji Hyo wants to apologize to him.)

1611
01:01:40,746 --> 01:01:43,186
You aren't as young and healthy as us,

1612
01:01:43,186 --> 01:01:44,616
- I'm healthy enough. - but we...

1613
01:01:45,246 --> 01:01:47,316
I'm sorry for complaining that you're a slow runner...

1614
01:01:47,316 --> 01:01:50,516
- and that you're a handful. - I understand.

1615
01:01:50,746 --> 01:01:53,286
There's something I really want to thank you for.

1616
01:01:53,686 --> 01:01:57,016
You know exactly what I like to eat.

1617
01:01:57,616 --> 01:02:01,086
You sent dried herring twice to the other members.

1618
01:02:02,086 --> 01:02:04,686
But since you knew that I don't like dried herring,

1619
01:02:04,686 --> 01:02:06,516
you didn't send it to me the second time around.

1620
01:02:07,046 --> 01:02:08,516
Oh, my goodness.

1621
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:09,746
Thank you for that.

1622
01:02:10,646 --> 01:02:11,916
- You know my taste in food. - Gosh.

1623
01:02:11,916 --> 01:02:15,046
- You said you didn't want it. - She sent it to everyone except me.

1624
01:02:15,086 --> 01:02:17,786
- You told her not to send you any. - I'm very thankful.

1625
01:02:18,086 --> 01:02:20,216
I didn't know you knew my taste in food.

1626
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:22,716
My family really enjoyed the first dried herring you sent us.

1627
01:02:23,286 --> 01:02:26,516
I don't eat herring, but my family enjoyed it.

1628
01:02:26,946 --> 01:02:29,986
I wondered why you didn't send me the herring for the second time.

1629
01:02:30,286 --> 01:02:34,346
I realized that it was because I said I can't eat herring.

1630
01:02:34,586 --> 01:02:36,216
That's what I thought.

1631
01:02:36,216 --> 01:02:37,886
Thank you.

1632
01:02:39,316 --> 01:02:40,786
- Seok Jin. - Yes?

1633
01:02:40,786 --> 01:02:43,316
(Ji Hyo wants to thank Seok Jin.)

1634
01:02:43,316 --> 01:02:46,146
I'm still glad that you're there.

1635
01:02:47,086 --> 01:02:48,216
Thank you.

1636
01:02:48,346 --> 01:02:49,986
"Thank you for your existence."

1637
01:02:50,046 --> 01:02:51,846
Is that what you mean?

1638
01:02:51,846 --> 01:02:52,916
What?

1639
01:02:52,916 --> 01:02:56,046
- "Thank you for your existence." - She has nothing else to thank for.

1640
01:02:56,516 --> 01:02:58,186
For my existence?

1641
01:02:58,186 --> 01:03:01,486
- I hope you'll stay healthy. - I love you anyway.

1642
01:03:02,186 --> 01:03:04,516
(Please be healthy.)

1643
01:03:04,516 --> 01:03:05,586
All right.

1644
01:03:06,246 --> 01:03:08,886
Here's the last mission for Running Man Link Trip.

1645
01:03:09,146 --> 01:03:11,386
- It's "Great Minds Think Alike". - What's that?

1646
01:03:11,516 --> 01:03:13,816
For this mission, Ji Hyo and...

1647
01:03:13,816 --> 01:03:17,516
the remaining five members must choose the same thing.

1648
01:03:17,886 --> 01:03:20,686
You clear the mission when more than three people agree with Ji Hyo.

1649
01:03:20,686 --> 01:03:24,086
When their choice agrees with Ji Hyo's,

1650
01:03:24,086 --> 01:03:26,586
one member is exempted from the punishment.

1651
01:03:27,346 --> 01:03:29,286
If it's 4 members, 2 are exempted.

1652
01:03:29,286 --> 01:03:31,416
- If it's 5 members, 3 are exempted. - Okay.

1653
01:03:32,216 --> 01:03:34,846
- This isn't easy. - It's difficult.

1654
01:03:34,946 --> 01:03:37,016
First player, please come out.

1655
01:03:37,386 --> 01:03:38,586
- Shall I start? - Okay.

1656
01:03:38,646 --> 01:03:40,486
- Go ahead. - Are you starting?

1657
01:03:41,486 --> 01:03:42,716
Here's the first game.

1658
01:03:43,246 --> 01:03:47,786
In the count of 3, choose 1 of the 2 flags.

1659
01:03:48,586 --> 01:03:49,746
Our choices have to match, right?

1660
01:03:49,986 --> 01:03:51,116
It's a short game.

1661
01:03:51,116 --> 01:03:52,616
(Let's avoid the ice shower.)

1662
01:03:53,016 --> 01:03:54,146
One.

1663
01:03:54,146 --> 01:03:55,746
(They hope for the same flag.)

1664
01:03:56,016 --> 01:03:57,116
Two.

1665
01:03:57,116 --> 01:03:59,416
(Are we thinking about the same color?)

1666
01:03:59,416 --> 01:04:04,416
(Sometimes they argued, but they worked well as a team.)

1667
01:04:04,746 --> 01:04:08,846
(Will their seven years of teamwork prove itself?)

1668
01:04:09,516 --> 01:04:10,516
Two.

1669
01:04:10,516 --> 01:04:11,816
(The success rate is 50 percent.)

1670
01:04:13,116 --> 01:04:14,246
Three.

1671
01:04:14,246 --> 01:04:16,516
(Will they lift the same flag?)

1672
01:04:16,516 --> 01:04:17,516
Three.

1673
01:04:19,846 --> 01:04:20,886
Three.

1674
01:04:20,886 --> 01:04:23,316
(Ji Hyo and Seok Jin choose the same flag.)

1675
01:04:23,716 --> 01:04:25,486
They did it.

1676
01:04:25,516 --> 01:04:26,916
(That was too easy.)

1677
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:28,846
- That was great. - They wouldn't choose the blue.

1678
01:04:29,386 --> 01:04:31,816
- This one was easy. - Choose what Ji Hyo would like.

1679
01:04:31,816 --> 01:04:32,886
The success rate is 50 percent.

1680
01:04:32,886 --> 01:04:35,186
- Choose what Ji Hyo would like. - That's right.

1681
01:04:35,186 --> 01:04:36,846
Choose what Ji Hyo would like.

1682
01:04:36,916 --> 01:04:38,516
Second player, please come out.

1683
01:04:39,086 --> 01:04:41,146
They're bungeoppang.

1684
01:04:41,146 --> 01:04:42,786
I like bungeoppang.

1685
01:04:42,786 --> 01:04:44,746
- Is it which part you eat first? - They look like real fish.

1686
01:04:44,746 --> 01:04:46,786
- Go ahead, Haha. - Wait.

1687
01:04:46,786 --> 01:04:48,486
- I'll play. - What about Kwang Soo?

1688
01:04:48,646 --> 01:04:49,816
It's okay.

1689
01:04:49,916 --> 01:04:50,986
You can go last.

1690
01:04:50,986 --> 01:04:52,286
Here's the same game.

1691
01:04:52,646 --> 01:04:56,446
Among the head, tail, and belly of bungeoppang,

1692
01:04:57,016 --> 01:04:59,786
choose a part and eat it.

1693
01:05:00,786 --> 01:05:03,746
- Eat it the way you usually do. - Of course.

1694
01:05:03,746 --> 01:05:07,116
(The success rate is one-third.)

1695
01:05:08,886 --> 01:05:10,216
(Will they choose the same part?)

1696
01:05:10,216 --> 01:05:11,216
One.

1697
01:05:11,216 --> 01:05:12,486
(Will they choose the same part?)

1698
01:05:12,816 --> 01:05:17,046
(Is it true that opposites attract?)

1699
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:22,286
(The two showed great teamwork and strong friendship.)

1700
01:05:23,246 --> 01:05:24,286
One.

1701
01:05:24,286 --> 01:05:25,946
(They test their friendship.)

1702
01:05:26,086 --> 01:05:29,846
(Wait, they're holding different parts.)

1703
01:05:30,286 --> 01:05:31,346
Two.

1704
01:05:31,346 --> 01:05:35,146
(Eat it the way Ji Hyo would eat it.)

1705
01:05:36,086 --> 01:05:37,216
(Which part will they eat first?)

1706
01:05:37,216 --> 01:05:38,616
Three.

1707
01:05:40,916 --> 01:05:42,246
What happened?

1708
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:44,516
- Please. - What happened?

1709
01:05:45,146 --> 01:05:47,246
(Ji Hyo bites the tail.)

1710
01:05:47,346 --> 01:05:49,786
- They chose the opposite. - Why did she eat the tail first?

1711
01:05:50,216 --> 01:05:52,486
Why would you eat the tail first?

1712
01:05:52,486 --> 01:05:53,986
I eat the tail first, too.

1713
01:05:53,986 --> 01:05:57,046
Isn't it because the tail is the crunchiest? It's crunchy.

1714
01:05:57,416 --> 01:05:59,716
- What's wrong with her? - Do you eat the tail first?

1715
01:05:59,846 --> 01:06:01,686
Most red beans are in the head.

1716
01:06:01,686 --> 01:06:03,316
- I know. - Calm down, Kwang Soo.

1717
01:06:03,316 --> 01:06:04,786
There are no red beans in the tail.

1718
01:06:04,786 --> 01:06:06,586
- Look. - Many people throw out the tail.

1719
01:06:06,586 --> 01:06:08,786
- Don't make her upset. - Stop it.

1720
01:06:08,786 --> 01:06:10,516
- I'm sorry. - It's not her fault.

1721
01:06:10,516 --> 01:06:12,386
- It's okay. - Thank you.

1722
01:06:12,386 --> 01:06:14,716
- I'm sorry. - Why do you eat bungeoppang then?

1723
01:06:14,786 --> 01:06:17,516
- I'm sorry. - You eat it for the red beans.

1724
01:06:17,516 --> 01:06:19,816
Why don't you eat plain batter instead?

1725
01:06:20,116 --> 01:06:23,116
- You haven't had your turn yet. - You need red beans.

1726
01:06:23,246 --> 01:06:27,116
Don't people say fish heads are the best part?

1727
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:28,386
What are you talking about?

1728
01:06:28,386 --> 01:06:29,886
What did you say?

1729
01:06:29,916 --> 01:06:30,946
You know what I mean.

1730
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:32,416
You said the wrong word.

1731
01:06:32,746 --> 01:06:34,886
- What? - There's a saying.

1732
01:06:34,886 --> 01:06:36,446
- What did he say? - You failed.

1733
01:06:36,446 --> 01:06:37,746
(Two more members must succeed.)

1734
01:06:37,746 --> 01:06:39,416
Third player, please come out.

1735
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:41,416
- Who's going third? - I'll play.

1736
01:06:42,016 --> 01:06:44,516
- This is the last chance. - We may have to take an ice shower.

1737
01:06:44,516 --> 01:06:46,216
This is the third round.

1738
01:06:46,846 --> 01:06:50,616
With one hand, indicate a number.

1739
01:06:50,946 --> 01:06:52,786
Indicate a number.

1740
01:06:53,116 --> 01:06:54,116
One.

1741
01:06:54,116 --> 01:06:58,386
(There are five numbers you can indicate with a hand.)

1742
01:06:59,386 --> 01:07:03,886
(Ji Hyo and Haha are close like family.)

1743
01:07:04,686 --> 01:07:11,286
(After a love triangle, they continue to be close friends.)

1744
01:07:12,346 --> 01:07:13,346
(The success rate is one-fifth.)

1745
01:07:13,346 --> 01:07:14,416
One.

1746
01:07:14,416 --> 01:07:16,386
(The success rate is one-fifth.)

1747
01:07:16,816 --> 01:07:17,886
Two.

1748
01:07:17,886 --> 01:07:21,186
(Will they choose the same number?)

1749
01:07:21,186 --> 01:07:22,246
Three.

1750
01:07:23,516 --> 01:07:24,686
You're the best.

1751
01:07:27,346 --> 01:07:28,416
You're the best.

1752
01:07:28,416 --> 01:07:30,216
(They choose the same number.)

1753
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:32,516
(The two are the best.)

1754
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:33,916
They did it.

1755
01:07:34,146 --> 01:07:36,316
- I love you. - That was impressive, Ji Hyo.

1756
01:07:36,346 --> 01:07:37,386
- Ji Hyo. - We did it.

1757
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:38,986
I thought you'd choose this.

1758
01:07:38,986 --> 01:07:42,446
I'm so nervous that my heart is beating so fast.

1759
01:07:42,586 --> 01:07:44,086
I'd have chosen this sign.

1760
01:07:44,086 --> 01:07:46,446
- The peace sign? - Yes.

1761
01:07:46,786 --> 01:07:49,416
Here's the next round.

1762
01:07:50,516 --> 01:07:51,886
- It's not easy. - Really?

1763
01:07:52,146 --> 01:07:53,886
(It's a difficult one.)

1764
01:07:54,886 --> 01:07:58,386
(No matter how hard the mission was, Ji Hyo and Jong Kook cleared it.)

1765
01:07:59,046 --> 01:08:04,886
(They make the strongest team.)

1766
01:08:05,716 --> 01:08:07,446
This is the fourth round.

1767
01:08:08,246 --> 01:08:09,386
Please open them.

1768
01:08:10,116 --> 01:08:11,216
What's that?

1769
01:08:11,816 --> 01:08:12,886
Open the lid.

1770
01:08:14,016 --> 01:08:15,916
- No way. - Gosh.

1771
01:08:15,916 --> 01:08:18,156
- This is too difficult. - It's impossible.

1772
01:08:18,156 --> 01:08:20,156
The success rate is too low.

1773
01:08:20,156 --> 01:08:22,746
Do we have to get the same number?

1774
01:08:22,746 --> 01:08:24,986
- You choose the number. - They choose the number?

1775
01:08:24,986 --> 01:08:26,816
Really? That's easy.

1776
01:08:26,816 --> 01:08:28,156
Okay.

1777
01:08:28,156 --> 01:08:30,186
This one is easy.

1778
01:08:30,186 --> 01:08:31,216
Let's start.

1779
01:08:31,286 --> 01:08:33,086
Wait, I'm not ready yet.

1780
01:08:33,086 --> 01:08:35,116
Show the number to the camera.

1781
01:08:35,116 --> 01:08:36,846
- Show it to the camera. - It's not the side facing you.

1782
01:08:36,986 --> 01:08:38,486
- One. - It's easy.

1783
01:08:38,486 --> 01:08:40,616
(Everyone expect them to choose the same number.)

1784
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:41,786
Two.

1785
01:08:42,516 --> 01:08:48,616
(If they succeed, they save one more member from the ice shower.)

1786
01:08:48,716 --> 01:08:49,786
Three.

1787
01:08:49,786 --> 01:08:52,286
(Jong Kook chooses one.)

1788
01:08:52,816 --> 01:08:53,886
Three.

1789
01:08:53,886 --> 01:08:55,386
(How about Ji Hyo?)

1790
01:08:55,386 --> 01:08:58,656
(She also chooses one.)

1791
01:08:58,846 --> 01:08:59,886
Three.

1792
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:00,986
(Both choose the same.)

1793
01:09:00,986 --> 01:09:02,086
Did we get it?

1794
01:09:02,316 --> 01:09:03,986
- That's right. - Did we get it?

1795
01:09:03,986 --> 01:09:06,516
- That's right. - We chose the same number.

1796
01:09:06,516 --> 01:09:08,156
We chose the same.

1797
01:09:08,316 --> 01:09:09,886
- Thank you. - We chose the same.

1798
01:09:09,886 --> 01:09:12,346
- Are we of one mind? - A moment ago,

1799
01:09:12,346 --> 01:09:14,316
she chose number one.

1800
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:15,386
Gosh.

1801
01:09:15,386 --> 01:09:16,746
That's not it.

1802
01:09:17,156 --> 01:09:18,156
(Haha is so cute.)

1803
01:09:18,156 --> 01:09:20,716
Isn't it the six of us? I would have picked this.

1804
01:09:21,016 --> 01:09:22,816
- There's six of us. - You would have picked that, right?

1805
01:09:22,816 --> 01:09:24,186
- I would have done this. - I wasn't sure either.

1806
01:09:24,186 --> 01:09:26,816
I thought she might pick 6. She really liked "7012".

1807
01:09:26,816 --> 01:09:28,516
- One is the best. - No,

1808
01:09:28,516 --> 01:09:31,016
there wasn't 7 and I didn't think it'd be 6.

1809
01:09:31,016 --> 01:09:32,016
There was no seven.

1810
01:09:32,316 --> 01:09:34,916
- We just did this, too. - You got this one right...

1811
01:09:34,916 --> 01:09:36,786
but why did you eat the bungeoppang's tail first?

1812
01:09:37,186 --> 01:09:38,216
(It's a 7-year-old telepathy.)

1813
01:09:38,216 --> 01:09:39,716
How did you get it right?

1814
01:09:39,716 --> 01:09:41,086
I told you.

1815
01:09:41,086 --> 01:09:43,246
There's the last round left.

1816
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:48,786
(It's Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo. How tough will the mission be?)

1817
01:09:50,346 --> 01:09:54,846
(They always quarrel but they take care of each other.)

1818
01:09:56,316 --> 01:09:59,316
(These two know each other very well.)

1819
01:10:00,016 --> 01:10:01,516
Bring in the question.

1820
01:10:01,516 --> 01:10:02,616
(We can do this, right?)

1821
01:10:03,016 --> 01:10:04,386
Is it one exemption so far?

1822
01:10:04,586 --> 01:10:06,346
- We have one exemption so far. - What's that?

1823
01:10:06,616 --> 01:10:08,216
Wait. No way. What's that?

1824
01:10:08,216 --> 01:10:10,656
- It looks difficult. - Eight?

1825
01:10:11,316 --> 01:10:14,286
You each have a calendar placed in front of you.

1826
01:10:15,216 --> 01:10:17,516
- In a count of three, - You know, right?

1827
01:10:17,516 --> 01:10:19,816
- flip to the same page. - You know, right?

1828
01:10:19,816 --> 01:10:23,416
(Here's the real test.)

1829
01:10:23,516 --> 01:10:24,846
You know right, Kwang Soo?

1830
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:26,446
(You know that number, right?)

1831
01:10:26,846 --> 01:10:29,216
We've been doing the same all this time.

1832
01:10:29,216 --> 01:10:33,086
- One... - Hold on.

1833
01:10:33,086 --> 01:10:34,486
(His eyes move.)

1834
01:10:34,486 --> 01:10:35,846
You know it, right?

1835
01:10:35,846 --> 01:10:37,516
- I would have done this, too. - Of course.

1836
01:10:37,516 --> 01:10:39,086
One,

1837
01:10:39,086 --> 01:10:40,216
(Everybody is thinking of the same number.)

1838
01:10:40,216 --> 01:10:41,746
In 1, 2, 3.

1839
01:10:41,746 --> 01:10:42,816
(Everybody is thinking of the same number.)

1840
01:10:43,716 --> 01:10:47,386
(Is this the number?)

1841
01:10:48,246 --> 01:10:50,416
(The answer to the 3rd mission was number 1.)

1842
01:10:51,116 --> 01:10:54,186
(The answer to the 4th mission was also number 1.)

1843
01:10:55,186 --> 01:10:56,916
(Is it January?)

1844
01:10:58,616 --> 01:11:03,916
(But there are 6 Running Man members.)

1845
01:11:05,316 --> 01:11:07,516
(There's also June.)

1846
01:11:08,316 --> 01:11:10,586
(What did Kwang Soo choose?)

1847
01:11:12,946 --> 01:11:15,386
(He picks July.)

1848
01:11:17,216 --> 01:11:22,186
(That was unexpected. What did Ji Hyo choose?)

1849
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:28,686
Did they match?

1850
01:11:28,686 --> 01:11:30,416
(They both chose July.)

1851
01:11:30,446 --> 01:11:31,616
It's right.

1852
01:11:31,616 --> 01:11:32,846
(They both chose July.)

1853
01:11:33,686 --> 01:11:34,816
It's seven.

1854
01:11:34,816 --> 01:11:35,816
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo pass.)

1855
01:11:35,816 --> 01:11:37,516
- I was thinking of January. - Me, too.

1856
01:11:37,516 --> 01:11:39,116
Running Man started in July.

1857
01:11:39,116 --> 01:11:41,016
- No, there are 7 of us. - We have 7 people.

1858
01:11:41,016 --> 01:11:42,686
- That's right, too. - We have seven people.

1859
01:11:42,686 --> 01:11:44,086
(We did it, Kwang Soo.)

1860
01:11:44,086 --> 01:11:46,486
- I would have picked number one. - Me, too.

1861
01:11:48,716 --> 01:11:52,016
(They started in July 2010 and spent 7 years together.)

1862
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:54,656
("7012" means that the 7 of them are together forever.)

1863
01:11:55,286 --> 01:11:57,716
(She starts tearing up.)

1864
01:11:58,616 --> 01:12:00,516
- I would have picked number one. - Me, too.

1865
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:02,116
- Ji Hyo. - Because it's January.

1866
01:12:02,116 --> 01:12:03,816
(No, we'll be 7 until the end.)

1867
01:12:04,446 --> 01:12:06,716
But why did you eat the tail first?

1868
01:12:07,086 --> 01:12:08,716
(Still, their chemistry was unbelievable.)

1869
01:12:08,716 --> 01:12:11,016
- How did you guess this correctly? - It was close.

1870
01:12:11,186 --> 01:12:12,446
7012.

1871
01:12:12,446 --> 01:12:15,416
(The 7 of them are 1 forever.)

1872
01:12:17,816 --> 01:12:19,446
You have successfully completed this mission.

1873
01:12:19,446 --> 01:12:20,586
It's two people.

1874
01:12:20,616 --> 01:12:22,916
Two people have been exempted from the penalty.

1875
01:12:22,916 --> 01:12:24,386
(There will be 2 less people taking the shower.)

1876
01:12:24,386 --> 01:12:25,656
- We have 1 from before... - It's 1 of us 3.

1877
01:12:25,656 --> 01:12:27,616
- We have 1 from before... - Up until now,

1878
01:12:27,816 --> 01:12:30,916
three people have been exempted...

1879
01:12:30,916 --> 01:12:33,656
- so two will receive the penalty. - I see.

1880
01:12:33,656 --> 01:12:36,516
These people will be picked.

1881
01:12:36,816 --> 01:12:37,816
Should we head down there?

1882
01:12:37,816 --> 01:12:39,586
- Please head to the valley. - Sure.

1883
01:12:39,616 --> 01:12:41,416
Let's go.

1884
01:12:41,416 --> 01:12:43,386
If we got the bungeoppang question, it would have been three people.

1885
01:12:43,386 --> 01:12:44,446
If we had gotten it correct...

1886
01:12:44,446 --> 01:12:46,386
(How would they take a shower on a winter night?)

1887
01:12:46,386 --> 01:12:48,116
- At least we won't be alone. - We're still incredible.

1888
01:12:48,116 --> 01:12:49,886
- We got them right. - Turn on the hot water.

1889
01:12:50,486 --> 01:12:52,016
(Final penalty spot)

1890
01:12:52,016 --> 01:12:53,716
Hold onto this.

1891
01:12:53,716 --> 01:12:55,316
- Is that cold water? - Is this it?

1892
01:12:55,316 --> 01:12:56,816
Cold water is good for men.

1893
01:12:56,816 --> 01:12:57,816
(Why are they so shocked?)

1894
01:12:59,156 --> 01:13:01,216
(It's nature's gift...)

1895
01:13:01,216 --> 01:13:03,086
(created by the freezing wind.)

1896
01:13:03,616 --> 01:13:06,016
(It's a freezing, outdoor sauna.)

1897
01:13:06,016 --> 01:13:08,186
- This is unbelievable. - This is no joke.

1898
01:13:08,316 --> 01:13:09,416
(They better not get picked.)

1899
01:13:09,416 --> 01:13:11,386
- It looks so cold. - It looks so cold.

1900
01:13:11,386 --> 01:13:12,486
Look at the ice.

1901
01:13:14,916 --> 01:13:16,686
This is impossible.

1902
01:13:16,816 --> 01:13:18,286
It's pure ice.

1903
01:13:18,516 --> 01:13:20,686
This is a lottery.

1904
01:13:21,316 --> 01:13:23,746
Pick a spot and stand behind it.

1905
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:24,986
Pick a spot.

1906
01:13:26,116 --> 01:13:28,816
(Ji Hyo will pick 2 people who will receive the penalty.)

1907
01:13:28,816 --> 01:13:30,316
My goodness. I don't know.

1908
01:13:30,316 --> 01:13:31,916
This is unbelievable.

1909
01:13:31,916 --> 01:13:34,046
I'm going to go with whatever's left. I can't choose.

1910
01:13:34,046 --> 01:13:35,216
I don't know.

1911
01:13:35,216 --> 01:13:37,586
(Ji Hyo will pull 2 ropes in random and pick 2 people.)

1912
01:13:37,586 --> 01:13:39,016
- I'll go with whatever's left. - I don't know.

1913
01:13:39,016 --> 01:13:40,656
- I'm going to change. - Let's go.

1914
01:13:40,656 --> 01:13:42,086
- Go. - I'll pick this one.

1915
01:13:42,086 --> 01:13:44,186
- I don't know. - You'll die in this weather.

1916
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:46,086
- It's fine. - I can manage.

1917
01:13:46,086 --> 01:13:48,516
- We can change. - Of course.

1918
01:13:48,516 --> 01:13:49,816
(She feels the pressure.)

1919
01:13:50,316 --> 01:13:51,686
- Right? - I think it's me.

1920
01:13:51,846 --> 01:13:53,116
It's two from here, right?

1921
01:13:53,116 --> 01:13:54,186
- It is. - I don't think it's me.

1922
01:13:54,186 --> 01:13:55,846
- Who wants to switch? - I don't think it's me.

1923
01:13:55,846 --> 01:13:56,846
(Please...)

1924
01:13:56,846 --> 01:13:57,886
Me.

1925
01:13:58,516 --> 01:14:00,086
- Anything can happen. - Let's switch.

1926
01:14:00,086 --> 01:14:01,616
- Never mind. - Just once.

1927
01:14:01,616 --> 01:14:03,686
(He refuses Kwang Soo.)

1928
01:14:03,816 --> 01:14:05,416
- Let's just go. - Come on.

1929
01:14:05,416 --> 01:14:06,816
- Switch with me. - I don't feel good about switching.

1930
01:14:06,816 --> 01:14:08,846
Why? What's wrong with me?

1931
01:14:08,846 --> 01:14:11,886
I think two from the Unlucky Trio will be picked.

1932
01:14:13,156 --> 01:14:15,216
I don't have a good feeling about this.

1933
01:14:15,216 --> 01:14:16,916
(Would it be from the Unlucky Trio?)

1934
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:19,086
It's up to Ji Hyo, right?

1935
01:14:19,086 --> 01:14:20,116
It's up to me?

1936
01:14:20,116 --> 01:14:21,986
You need to pull on the rope.

1937
01:14:22,846 --> 01:14:24,946
- Good luck. - This is driving me nuts.

1938
01:14:25,816 --> 01:14:26,816
(There are 5 ropes tangled inside the box. Her choices are random.)

1939
01:14:26,816 --> 01:14:28,586
- Ji Hyo. - There's a lot of anger in me.

1940
01:14:28,586 --> 01:14:29,816
I love you.

1941
01:14:29,816 --> 01:14:31,656
- Ji Hyo. - She won't know either.

1942
01:14:31,656 --> 01:14:34,516
I'll let you walk on the flowery path.

1943
01:14:34,516 --> 01:14:36,386
- This is driving me nuts. - I'm filled with anger.

1944
01:14:36,386 --> 01:14:37,746
Just pull one.

1945
01:14:38,416 --> 01:14:40,316
These are the last moments.

1946
01:14:40,486 --> 01:14:41,716
It's already cold.

1947
01:14:42,216 --> 01:14:43,216
I'm so cold.

1948
01:14:43,316 --> 01:14:45,716
- I'm cold. - How did you pick today?

1949
01:14:45,716 --> 01:14:47,446
We're deep in the mountains of Gangwon-do.

1950
01:14:47,616 --> 01:14:51,716
Ji Hyo will pull on the ropes now.

1951
01:14:51,716 --> 01:14:54,086
If you get picked, are you saved or do you get the penalty?

1952
01:14:54,086 --> 01:14:56,116
- You get the penalty. - Would our hands go up?

1953
01:14:56,716 --> 01:15:00,446
(Don't blame me.)

1954
01:15:01,486 --> 01:15:05,816
(Nobody knows who'll get picked.)

1955
01:15:06,816 --> 01:15:08,616
(Pick anything.)

1956
01:15:08,616 --> 01:15:10,016
- We know. - It's random.

1957
01:15:10,016 --> 01:15:11,516
- I love you. - Go for it.

1958
01:15:11,516 --> 01:15:13,286
(I just hope it's not me.)

1959
01:15:13,286 --> 01:15:15,656
- It's okay. - Thanks to you, we had meat...

1960
01:15:15,656 --> 01:15:18,316
- in Pyeongchang today. - Let's go.

1961
01:15:18,316 --> 01:15:19,416
(It's a difficult situation at the end of a happy trip.)

1962
01:15:21,186 --> 01:15:26,846
(Who will be the first one to enter the icy water?)

1963
01:15:27,916 --> 01:15:30,416
Who wants to take a rose petal bath...

1964
01:15:30,516 --> 01:15:32,016
in the new year?

1965
01:15:32,016 --> 01:15:33,016
Ji Hyo.

1966
01:15:33,516 --> 01:15:35,186
Who wants to take a rose petal bath?

1967
01:15:35,186 --> 01:15:39,046
(Me)

1968
01:15:39,516 --> 01:15:42,286
(Jae Seok gets picked.)

1969
01:15:43,516 --> 01:15:45,016
(She feels so bad.)

1970
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:48,446
Ji Hyo, it started with the bungeoppang.

1971
01:15:48,446 --> 01:15:49,786
He got picked again. One is done.

1972
01:15:49,786 --> 01:15:51,746
That's good.

1973
01:15:51,746 --> 01:15:53,516
- What happens next? - That was so intense.

1974
01:15:53,516 --> 01:15:54,916
This is driving me nuts.

1975
01:15:54,916 --> 01:15:57,656
He was the first one to pick.

1976
01:15:57,656 --> 01:15:59,656
I had a bad feeling.

1977
01:16:01,386 --> 01:16:03,216
(A few minutes ago)

1978
01:16:04,346 --> 01:16:07,416
(Jae Seok was the first to pick.)

1979
01:16:07,586 --> 01:16:08,586
I can't choose.

1980
01:16:08,586 --> 01:16:11,186
(He thought today might be different but no.)

1981
01:16:11,716 --> 01:16:13,446
- I'll go. It's okay, Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo picked.

1982
01:16:13,446 --> 01:16:16,086
- She's picking. - It's okay. Pick one more person.

1983
01:16:16,086 --> 01:16:17,116
(I can't do this.)

1984
01:16:17,516 --> 01:16:19,846
- It'd be funny if it's Kwang Soo. - I agree.

1985
01:16:20,046 --> 01:16:21,116
(I don't want to be funny today.)

1986
01:16:21,116 --> 01:16:23,116
Please let it be Seok Jin or Kwang Soo.

1987
01:16:23,116 --> 01:16:24,946
- It's not me. - This is killing me.

1988
01:16:24,946 --> 01:16:27,016
- I don't think it's me. - Please.

1989
01:16:27,746 --> 01:16:29,816
- It's not me. - Let's make it funny.

1990
01:16:29,816 --> 01:16:31,516
- Go, Ji Hyo. - Pull hard.

1991
01:16:31,516 --> 01:16:33,016
Pick whatever.

1992
01:16:33,086 --> 01:16:34,686
Who wants to...

1993
01:16:34,686 --> 01:16:37,846
(Ji Hyo was the first host of Member's Week.)

1994
01:16:38,916 --> 01:16:46,916
(Who will be the last person to enter the icy water?)

1995
01:16:47,516 --> 01:16:50,586
Who wants to take a rose petal bath?

1996
01:16:51,186 --> 01:16:55,086
(Me?)

1997
01:16:55,086 --> 01:16:56,946
(Haha gets picked.)

1998
01:16:58,086 --> 01:16:59,656
(I'm sorry.)

1999
01:17:00,086 --> 01:17:01,416
(He's in despair.)

2000
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:03,686
He wanted to switch with you.

2001
01:17:03,686 --> 01:17:05,186
I told you to switch with me.

2002
01:17:05,186 --> 01:17:06,316
(I should have switched with Kwang Soo.)

2003
01:17:06,416 --> 01:17:10,186
Pyeongchang has fresh air...

2004
01:17:10,186 --> 01:17:12,916
- and beautiful landscape. - That's right.

2005
01:17:12,916 --> 01:17:15,116
We hope that many people visit and enjoy their time.

2006
01:17:15,116 --> 01:17:16,656
- That's right. - Let's go,

2007
01:17:16,656 --> 01:17:18,116
- Haha. - It'd be funny if it was Kwang Soo.

2008
01:17:18,116 --> 01:17:19,286
What can you do?

2009
01:17:19,286 --> 01:17:21,116
- Let's go. - I'm sorry.

2010
01:17:21,116 --> 01:17:22,486
(It's time for icy water bath.)

2011
01:17:23,746 --> 01:17:25,816
Don't you have to wet your chest to protect your heart?

2012
01:17:25,916 --> 01:17:27,186
You should.

2013
01:17:27,186 --> 01:17:29,156
- I'm an expert in this. - Is that right?

2014
01:17:29,656 --> 01:17:30,716
Look at their feet.

2015
01:17:30,716 --> 01:17:31,716
(That's a fancy warm up.)

2016
01:17:32,116 --> 01:17:35,016
You're going in the water in the new year...

2017
01:17:35,086 --> 01:17:36,686
so I hope that you'll be healthy this year.

2018
01:17:36,686 --> 01:17:38,216
- That's for sure. - Health is of foremost importance.

2019
01:17:38,216 --> 01:17:39,786
Please be healthy.

2020
01:17:40,116 --> 01:17:42,246
- Be healthy, viewers. - Running Man will last forever.

2021
01:17:42,386 --> 01:17:44,216
It's time for Jae Seok to have his second child.

2022
01:17:44,216 --> 01:17:47,316
- Okay. That's great. - This will bring you good luck.

2023
01:17:48,086 --> 01:17:50,786
- Running Man, forever. - Let's do this.

2024
01:17:51,746 --> 01:17:53,386
There's ice.

2025
01:17:53,846 --> 01:17:55,116
(It will wake them up.)

2026
01:17:55,116 --> 01:17:56,686
They added ice.

2027
01:17:56,816 --> 01:17:58,186
- Hold on. - Let's check it out.

2028
01:17:58,186 --> 01:17:59,586
(They check the temperature.)

2029
01:18:00,046 --> 01:18:01,116
For goodness' sake.

2030
01:18:02,186 --> 01:18:06,216
(It's "Frozen" in the middle of winter.)

2031
01:18:06,216 --> 01:18:07,316
Hey.

2032
01:18:07,446 --> 01:18:09,446
(I hope you come out alive.)

2033
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:11,986
- Is it that bad? - This is ice water.

2034
01:18:12,486 --> 01:18:13,486
(Come. I'll give you your second child.)

2035
01:18:13,486 --> 01:18:14,516
It's cold water.

2036
01:18:16,156 --> 01:18:17,446
(Let's go in.)

2037
01:18:17,446 --> 01:18:19,716
You're amazing.

2038
01:18:20,016 --> 01:18:23,386
Viewers, I wish you the best in the new year.

2039
01:18:23,386 --> 01:18:27,116
Happy New Year!

2040
01:18:27,116 --> 01:18:28,116
(Choking)

2041
01:18:28,486 --> 01:18:29,516
Are you all right?

2042
01:18:29,686 --> 01:18:31,616
- Are you all right? - What's wrong?

2043
01:18:31,716 --> 01:18:34,216
- Go in the warm water. - What's wrong with you?

2044
01:18:34,216 --> 01:18:36,446
Let's go in the rose petal water.

2045
01:18:36,446 --> 01:18:37,746
All right.

2046
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:39,916
The flowery path.

2047
01:18:39,916 --> 01:18:41,086
Don't worry.

2048
01:18:41,186 --> 01:18:42,816
Viewers,

2049
01:18:42,816 --> 01:18:44,286
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

2050
01:18:44,286 --> 01:18:45,656
(The icy water will bring everyone luck.)

2051
01:18:46,746 --> 01:18:50,946
(Let's do this and bring in all the luck for Ji Hyo.)

2052
01:18:51,416 --> 01:18:53,916
(Let's go in on three.)

2053
01:18:55,716 --> 01:18:57,116
(Neither of them move.)

2054
01:18:57,116 --> 01:18:59,116
- You shouldn't jump. - We have our own timing.

2055
01:18:59,116 --> 01:19:00,946
- It's slippery. - Don't jump.

2056
01:19:00,946 --> 01:19:02,986
- We should just go in. - Just stand.

2057
01:19:03,016 --> 01:19:05,156
- One, two, - Two.

2058
01:19:05,216 --> 01:19:06,216
Three.

2059
01:19:06,586 --> 01:19:08,486
(Jae Seok dives in.)

2060
01:19:09,616 --> 01:19:11,616
(He's completely submerged.)

2061
01:19:12,886 --> 01:19:15,186
(Way to go, Jae Seok!)

2062
01:19:16,246 --> 01:19:18,946
(Haha goes in as well.)

2063
01:19:21,116 --> 01:19:24,686
(Ji Hyo, we will make you walk on the flowery road.)

2064
01:19:25,846 --> 01:19:29,586
(This trip isn't what I thought it was going to be.)

2065
01:19:30,686 --> 01:19:33,286
(I'm sorry, I'm thankful, and I love you.)

2066
01:19:33,286 --> 01:19:36,346
Happy New Year, viewers!

2067
01:19:36,416 --> 01:19:37,786
Happy New Year!

2068
01:19:37,786 --> 01:19:38,846
(He aggressively washes his face.)

2069
01:19:39,116 --> 01:19:42,386
(The trip of becoming one was a huge success.)

2070
01:19:42,386 --> 01:19:44,116
Wear this, Jae Seok.

2071
01:19:44,516 --> 01:19:46,786
- Here you go. - Get out of there.

2072
01:19:46,886 --> 01:19:50,216
(What will Jong Kook's wish be for next week?)

2073
01:19:50,386 --> 01:19:54,216
It's Running Man's New Year Project for 2017. It's Member's Week.

2074
01:19:54,486 --> 01:19:55,986
The second runner is...

2075
01:19:56,786 --> 01:19:58,016
Jong Kook.

2076
01:19:58,016 --> 01:19:59,786
(Kim Jong Kook)

2077
01:19:59,786 --> 01:20:01,746
(Have you ever seen Jong Kook like this?)

2078
01:20:01,746 --> 01:20:04,156
I won't get upset no matter what you say to me.

2079
01:20:04,156 --> 01:20:05,786
(Jong Kook has never been shy like this before.)

2080
01:20:05,786 --> 01:20:08,486
(Jong Kook goes on a real date.)

2081
01:20:08,486 --> 01:20:12,186
(His brother is there.)

2082
01:20:12,186 --> 01:20:14,386
(His friends on Running Man are there, too.)

2083
01:20:14,386 --> 01:20:18,346
(Let's make Jong Kook get married.)

2084
01:20:19,516 --> 01:20:21,316
Where should he go next?

2085
01:20:21,816 --> 01:20:25,846
(How will this date end?)

2086
01:20:26,286 --> 01:20:28,286
(Next week's Member's Week, Marrying Jong Kook Off)
