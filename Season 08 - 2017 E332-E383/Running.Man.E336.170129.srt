1
00:00:04,987 --> 00:00:07,857
(Member's Week on Running Man)

2
00:00:07,857 --> 00:00:08,987
(Fourth)

3
00:00:08,987 --> 00:00:10,457
(Who is the fourth participant?)

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,970
Today's rule is if the participant wins, the prize will be doubled.

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,500
Say a few words to the members.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,740
Are you fully prepared?

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,200
I won't go easy on you.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,840
I won't feel bad.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,340
My plan is to get rid of them all at once.

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,870
(Please look forward to my great accomplishment.)

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,570
(Running Man, Ultimate Battle of Supernaturals)

12
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,940
(Gary was the winner of the 1st and the 2nd Ultimate Battle.)

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,640
(Haha was the winner of the 3rd Ultimate Battle.)

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,500
(Jae Seok was the winner of the 4th Ultimate Battle.)

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,070
(Haha was the winner of the 5th Ultimate Battle.)

16
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,270
I am Agent Jae Seok.

17
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:55,840
(Agent Jae Seok)

18
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,440
I am Black Widow Ji Hyo.

19
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,000
(Black Widow Ji Hyo)

20
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,670
(Avatar Kwang Soo)

21
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,400
I am Thor.

22
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,670
(Thor Jong Kook)

23
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,240
In front of your eyes...

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,070
(Detective Seok Jin)

25
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,940
I am the Time Controller.

26
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,500
(Time Controller Haha)

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,340
(Who will be the final winner?)

28
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,940
(Magic energy surrounds Sangam-dong.)

29
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,070
(R Headquarters have an unapproachable aura.)

30
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:26,170
(It's the shrine of the best supernaturals.)

31
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,840
(Jae Seok appears first in R Headquarters.)

32
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,740
The fourth Member's Week is Ultimate Battle of Supernaturals.

33
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,300
You are to prevent the host of the fourth Member's Week from winning...

34
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,640
and to become the ultimate winner.

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,700
I understand.

36
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,970
- You are Agent Jae Seok. - That's right.

37
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,240
- You are Agent Jae Seok. - That's right.

38
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,140
Water gun is a symbol of me.

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,340
(The first supernatural is Agent Jae Seok.)

40
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,770
(He approaches quietly and eliminates his target at once.)

41
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,600
Your special ability is to snipe at the name tags.

42
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,940
- What is that? - If you shoot the name tags...

43
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,370
with your water gun,

44
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
you can eliminate the corresponding member.

45
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,700
Everyone is on their toes about my water gun.

46
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,940
(Agent Jae Seok has to shoot their name tags with the water gun.)

47
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,240
Haha, you are Time Controller.

48
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,900
I can travel the time.

49
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,970
I am Time Controller Haha.

50
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,370
(The second supernatural is Time Controller Haha.)

51
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,810
(He has a superhuman ability that stops the time from passing by.)

52
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,970
Your mission will determine the level of your special ability.

53
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,940
Your mission is to deactivate bombs.

54
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,970
Did you say I have to deactivate bombs?

55
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,270
You have to solve the hints in order to deactivate each bomb.

56
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,970
The level of the ability will depend on how many bombs you deactivate.

57
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,240
Will it explode here?

58
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,870
I have to succeed this mission then.

59
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,240
I am Time Controller.

60
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,740
(Time Controller Haha's mission is to deactivate bombs.)

61
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,400
You are Black Widow Ji Hyo.

62
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,770
Your special ability is your looks.

63
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,700
With a particular motion and spell, your ability will be put in action.

64
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,400
It will help you defend yourself and is divided into three stages.

65
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,900
Your mission is to make the coin stand.

66
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,270
If you can make the coin stand for three seconds, it's a success.

67
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,500
(Black Widow Ji Hyo's mission is to make the coin stand.)

68
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,540
I am Detective Seok Jin.

69
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,440
It's the unfortunate character.

70
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,500
(Unfortunate Detective Seok Jin is stepping up.)

71
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,000
You have to spot the differences to complete the mission.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,440
- Spot the differences? - Yes.

73
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,440
Take a good look at the scriptwriter in front of you.

74
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,770
I have to figure out what has changed.

75
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,170
(He has to find 7 differences to get the highest level.)

76
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,340
In 10 seconds?

77
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,200
(Detective Seok Jin's mission is to spot the differences.)

78
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,340
You are Thor Jong Kook.

79
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Your special ability can enlarge the name tags.

80
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,270
When you hit the ground with the hammer,

81
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,740
the chosen member's name tag will be enlarged.

82
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,870
In 30 seconds, you have to hammer the nails stuck on the wood.

83
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,940
You clear the mission if you hammer them properly at the first try.

84
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,140
The ability level will be determined by the number of nails you hammer.

85
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,270
(Thor Jong Kook's mission is to hammer the nails at once.)

86
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,100
You are Avatar Kwang Soo.

87
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,640
You have the ability to control other supernaturals' abilities.

88
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,340
You can control one of the members' abilities that you want.

89
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,900
- So I can absorb their abilities? - Yes.

90
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,270
You can absorb them. The mission for you is...

91
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,800
to make bonds with people as an Avatar.

92
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,000
Put on an Avatar make-up and meet citizens...

93
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,900
What? Hey.

94
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,540
(You are joking, right?)

95
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,640
It's not difficult. Go meet the citizens...

96
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,900
and say the certain spell out loud.

97
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,370
- Then bond your hair with others'. - What?

98
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,000
Did I do something wrong? Is this a penalty?

99
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,300
- What? Spell? - Yes, that's your mission.

100
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,370
Hold out your hair after then.

101
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,670
If the citizens say those words and hold out their hair in return,

102
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,610
you accomplish the mission.

103
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,670
It's easy, right?

104
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,670
I give up.

105
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,740
What is this?

106
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,400
(Perfect urination system)

107
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,500
We prepared so well.

108
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,440
Thank you so much.

109
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,770
(Avatar Kwang Soo's mission is to bond with people.)

110
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,540
(We can sometimes find the Na'vi people in Sangam-dong.)

111
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,370
(We hear that a new Avatar has been born.)

112
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,800
(Earth, are you ready to meet the new Avatar?)

113
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,800
(Kwang Soo's waiting room)

114
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,840
Why?

115
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,800
(I see you.)

116
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,040
I give up.

117
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,540
You can't give up.

118
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll rather accept the penalty.

119
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,600
You remember the spell, right?

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,200
(Avatar Kwang Soo heads out to the outside world.)

121
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,600
(Walking on eggshells)

122
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,800
Hello.

123
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,870
- Are you an Avatar? - Yes.

124
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,170
- You are Kwang Soo, right? - Yes, hello.

125
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,700
- You can't recognize easily, right? - I can know because of your height.

126
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,400
You can recognize with me with my height.

127
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,570
I'd rather be nude.

128
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,700
(He finds people in the elevator.)

129
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,700
(Embarrassed)

130
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,370
(Please leave the elevator. I want to be left alone.)

131
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,000
(It's hard to even look at him with his hideous aura.)

132
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,170
(Are there anyone who will join me in my mission?)

133
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,200
(The area is full of people today.)

134
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,370
I really can't go outside like this. What should I do?

135
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,000
He's over there.

136
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,800
What's that Avatar doing there?

137
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,900
(Strong impression)

138
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,200
Avatar Kwang Soo.

139
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,100
Hello. Wait a second.

140
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,540
Why do you look so normal?

141
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,900
What are you doing?

142
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,900
(Why are you dressed like that?)

143
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,800
Kwang Soo...

144
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,700
(I was tricked.)

145
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,870
That scumbag.

146
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,840
(Do you think I'm easy?)

147
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,400
(Jae Seok's mission is to shoot as many name tags as possible.)

148
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,370
(Avatar Kwang Soo is occupied with the director.)

149
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,200
What is this?

150
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,100
(He approaches slowly and shoots quietly.)

151
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,540
That's not what you told me.

152
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,970
Why are you dressed like that?

153
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,270
(Agent Jae Seok succeeded in shooting one person.)

154
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,800
What are we doing today?

155
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,500
(He hides the evidence quickly after he's done.)

156
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,600
Hey, why are you...

157
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,040
Why are you dressed like this?

158
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,140
Did they tell you that everyone's doing the same?

159
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,370
(I need to do something with that director.)

160
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,600
By the way, what is this? Are you a servant or something?

161
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,900
What are you talking about?

162
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,700
I have to go now. See you later.

163
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,540
You are doing something, right? What are we doing today?

164
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,700
I don't know. What's she doing over there?

165
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,600
She's not wearing any costumes.

166
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,940
(Black Widow Ji Hyo is absorbed in her mission.)

167
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,940
Don't come near me.

168
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,800
- What are you doing? - Oh, my. What is that?

169
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,300
(It's a shocking visual.)

170
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,470
(Silently approaching)

171
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,500
What are you doing?

172
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,170
(Ji Hyo is absorbed in her mission.)

173
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,600
How did you get this to stand up?

174
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Don't come near me.

175
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,300
(In that case,)

176
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,200
(shall I do my mission?)

177
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,670
- How did you make this stand up? - Leave me alone.

178
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,070
- Kwang Soo. - How?

179
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,070
(Shooting)

180
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,570
(Agent Jae Seok succeeded in shooting 2 people.)

181
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,570
Don't come near me.

182
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,540
(He shot at a single chance with his confusion tactics.)

183
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,600
How did you do it?

184
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,070
- It's easy with one-cent coin. - It's so cool.

185
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,070
(Ji Hyo doesn't know anything.)

186
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,840
- Is that your mission? - Leave me alone.

187
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,800
(Going this way and that)

188
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
Go away.

189
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,770
(He's hiding the name tag in case Kwang Soo notices.)

190
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,170
Where is Seok Jin and Haha?

191
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,540
Ten seconds left.

192
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,600
Ten seconds? She must have a deadline.

193
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,500
Do you have a mission?

194
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,200
(Wait a minute. Why does the paint stain look so familiar?)

195
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,300
Wait a minute.

196
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,440
(Did you see it?)

197
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,700
(Please keep quiet.)

198
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,800
I didn't do it to yours.

199
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,070
(It might feel suspicious but I didn't shoot at yours.)

200
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,640
- You didn't do mine? - I didn't do yours.

201
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,000
(What is happening?)

202
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,210
- You didn't do mine? - I didn't do yours.

203
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,600
I couldn't do yours.

204
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,270
(Anyway, I caught you.)

205
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,540
- Be quiet. - Everything is up to me now.

206
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,940
You know that you can't finish your mission if everyone knows, right?

207
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,000
- I'm begging you. - In that case,

208
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,470
- I'll give you a final chance. - Okay.

209
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,100
(Avatar spell)

210
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,070
- Think carefully. - What is that?

211
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,070
You need to make a bond with me. Using the hair.

212
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,470
Yes, I remember.

213
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,740
(Give and take)

214
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,070
This is your final chance.

215
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,540
(It's okay to commune in exchange for keeping quiet.)

216
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,800
- It's your final chance. - What is that?

217
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,640
I told you to concentrate.

218
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,710
It's your final chance.

219
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,400
I told you that it's your final chance.

220
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,670
- Okay. - I can tell...

221
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,710
I get it.

222
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,900
(Running away)

223
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,500
Hey.

224
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,800
(Sorry, Kwang Soo. I can't do this.)

225
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,900
I'm telling you.

226
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,570
Jae Seok, wait!

227
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,100
What are you doing?

228
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,400
(Be careful of that blue giant.)

229
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,770
- Be aware of Kwang Soo. - What is it?

230
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,270
(I only need a strand of hair.)

231
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,570
- Wait. - He looks really like an Avatar.

232
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,940
He's scary.

233
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,440
(Jae Seok runs away leaving the cameraman.)

234
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,540
Please do the mission with me.

235
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,840
What am I supposed to do?

236
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,900
You know how they make a bond, right?

237
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,370
Jae Seok, wait. Do this for me.

238
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,170
(Jae Seok runs towards Thor Jong Kook without a cameraman.)

239
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,300
(Shooting)

240
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,070
(Agent Jae Seok succeeded in shooting 3 people.)

241
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,710
(He hammers in anger without knowing anything.)

242
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,340
The time is up.

243
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,640
I can't do this.

244
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,670
Jong Kook, you couldn't hammer even a single nail.

245
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,900
- Oh, my. - Your ability will be level one.

246
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,470
You get a cotton hammer and an Exchange Card.

247
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,570
(Filming is not important. Kwang Soo is in a rush.)

248
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,770
You have to do this.

249
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Please.

250
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,900
(Avatar spell)

251
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,470
(What would the first captured human do?)

252
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,600
(Shy)

253
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
Thank you.

254
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,740
(Kwang Soo succeeds in communing with one person.)

255
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,900
Thank you! You're the best.

256
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,570
(He's the best cameraman.)

257
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,900
(Thank you, kind human.)

258
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,040
Thank you.

259
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,470
Where is Seok Jin?

260
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,270
(After shooting at Jong Kook's name tag, Jae Seok looks for Seok Jin.)

261
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,440
(Detective Seok Jin is trying to find the differences.)

262
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,540
The glasses.

263
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,400
- Where is Seok Jin? - Here.

264
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,370
- I'm really good at this. - He's here? Okay.

265
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,570
(After a quick interrogation, he finds where Seok Jin is.)

266
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,100
Do we have to tear out name tags today?

267
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,770
It's not finished yet.

268
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,800
(He hides the water gun before going inside.)

269
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,400
- What are you doing? - Oh, hey.

270
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,500
- I'm doing my mission now. - What is it?

271
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,300
It's important. You can't see.

272
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,340
- I can. - No, you can't.

273
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,370
Why not?

274
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,440
I shouldn't let you know what my ability is.

275
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,500
What is your power?

276
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,000
(What would his deadly shot be like?)

277
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,070
This cigarette box looks suspicious.

278
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,070
(Shooting)

279
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,200
(One shot, one kill)

280
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,800
You can't see this. Go away.

281
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,000
This cigarette box...

282
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,440
(Seok Jin couldn't have noticed, right?)

283
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,000
- This isn't your week, is it? - Go away.

284
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,270
(This detective is very naive.)

285
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,000
He's acting weirdly.

286
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,700
(Then I'll get going.)

287
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,700
(Agent Jae Seok succeeded in shooting 4 people.)

288
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,400
Their knowing my mission doesn't matter, right?

289
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,370
(If he shoots Haha's name tag, his ability becomes the highest level.)

290
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,440
Where is Haha?

291
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,600
(The six members are busy doing their missions.)

292
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,570
(Kwang Soo has a long way to go.)

293
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,800
What should I do?

294
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,940
I mean, they seem scared of me.

295
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,970
What should I do?

296
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,900
I should go ask them.

297
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,240
(He finds the target to make a bond.)

298
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,100
- Hi. - What are you shooting?

299
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,470
(They seem curious. It's a nice start.)

300
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,000
- Aren't you cold? - Yes.

301
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,640
I got a hot pack for you.

302
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,670
- Thank you. - I only have one.

303
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,900
- He's so kind. - I'm not finished.

304
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,800
(Don't just go after receiving my hot pack.)

305
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,300
I have a mission.

306
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,870
Look at me and listen carefully.

307
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,470
- We're busy. - I'll be quick.

308
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,600
(Avatar spell)

309
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,270
(Desperate)

310
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,940
What is he talking about?

311
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,600
(Can you feel my telepathy?)

312
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,400
I want to bond with you.

313
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,670
I really like your hair.

314
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,570
(Avatar Kwang Soo fails to make a bond.)

315
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,370
Thank you.

316
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,740
(Please stop following us.)

317
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,770
Thank you.

318
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,640
(He now feels even colder without his hot pack.)

319
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,200
I'm sorry but can you get my hot pack back?

320
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,600
Can you get my hot pack back?

321
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,470
(Everyone is looking.)

322
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,600
What should I do?

323
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,070
(He wants to hide as everyone's looking at him.)

324
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,070
You can't see me, right?

325
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,500
I am of the same color.

326
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,800
(He's proud of his protective color tactics.)

327
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
I feel like a chameleon.

328
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,370
(I should keep looking for the color blue.)

329
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,440
It's the perfect color.

330
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,000
(We still can see you.)

331
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,700
Hello.

332
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,740
(Some people approach him.)

333
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,940
- Have you seen the movie "Avatar"? - Yes.

334
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,370
Do you know how they bond each other?

335
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,700
- Yes. - You know?

336
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,470
Do you want to make a bond?

337
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,270
(I found the perfect partner.)

338
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,840
Can you look at my actions and do what comes into your mind?

339
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,870
- Is that okay? - Yes.

340
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,040
- You do it. - Well...

341
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,600
(Avatar spell)

342
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,900
(It's the same scene from the movie.)

343
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,570
(Just connect your shiny hair to mine.)

344
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,900
Don't they do like this?

345
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,070
(Shrieking)

346
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,400
(What is this?)

347
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,240
What is wrong with you?

348
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,740
Wait a second.

349
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,240
(She must have thought of an archaeopteryx.)

350
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,400
I couldn't find it on the internet when I searched.

351
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,040
Do we do the same thing?

352
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,000
(That's correct.)

353
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,540
(He tries one more time.)

354
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,100
(He says the word.)

355
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,240
(Will she help Avatar Kwang Soo clear the mission?)

356
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,270
(She repeats after him.)

357
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,340
(The mission is cleared.)

358
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,770
- Mission accomplished. - Yes!

359
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,900
Thank you so much.

360
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,840
(Kwang Soo reaches level two.)

361
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,470
Of course. Thank you.

362
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,270
(They take a photo together.)

363
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,900
(Avatar Kwang Soo, The Legend of the Blue Sea)

364
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,000
Where's Haha?

365
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,770
Which floor is he on?

366
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,640
I have no idea.

367
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
(Agent Jae Seok's last target is Haha.)

368
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,800
What does this mean?

369
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,740
Who's Grakkus?

370
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,870
"What's the color of the lightsaber blade in 'Star Wars'"?

371
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,800
Is it red or blue?

372
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,170
(He chooses blue.)

373
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,400
Was that wrong?

374
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,200
(He fails the first bomb.)

375
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:09,470
Wait, what's Wright and Grimm?

376
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,700
(They refer to brothers.)

377
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,840
Is it the Wright brothers?

378
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,800
(Which number do the words refer to?)

379
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,570
(He picks the second.)

380
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,640
It was right.

381
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,370
"Which color do the blank letters refer to?"

382
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,070
(The answer is red.)

383
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,470
(If he's correct, he reaches level two.)

384
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,040
(Will Haha cut the red cord?)

385
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,200
(He chooses black.)

386
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,300
What happened?

387
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,870
(He only reaches level one.)

388
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,070
You answered one correctly.

389
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,070
Let's go to the third floor.

390
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,240
(At that time)

391
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,740
(Agent Jae Seok's last target is Haha.)

392
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,800
(Run quickly and send Haha away.)

393
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,300
What are you doing?

394
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,100
(Haha spots Jae Seok.)

395
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,370
- What are you doing? - What's this?

396
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,000
- What are you doing? - What's this?

397
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,840
What was this?

398
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,370
Who's Grakkus?

399
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,970
- What are you looking at? - You didn't do well.

400
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,800
- I'm wandering about. - Don't come near me.

401
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,200
- Don't come near me. - What's wrong?

402
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,240
You have a water gun.

403
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,540
I was only scratching myself.

404
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,970
Goodness, what's this?

405
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,070
Why do you keep coming here? Go away.

406
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,040
I was only passing by.

407
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,300
Are you trying to do something to me?

408
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,400
Where's Seok Jin?

409
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,970
Have you seen Seok Jin?

410
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,670
No.

411
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,240
Where's Seok Jin?

412
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,500
(Jae Seok seems suspicious.)

413
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,340
He's too suspicious.

414
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,840
(He waits for another chance.)

415
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,570
This is my superpower.

416
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,400
(He's ready to say the word.)

417
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
Let's go back in time.

418
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,840
(Haha gets the superpower to turn back 10 seconds.)

419
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,670
He's still there.

420
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,640
It's better to attack Haha after his mission.

421
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,000
(Haha, you're terribly mistaken if you think it's over.)

422
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,370
What's going on?

423
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,740
Gosh, he's done.

424
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,070
Turn off the lights.

425
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,170
(It's time to charge.)

426
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:04,410
(Agent Jae Seok goes back to where Haha came from.)

427
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,570
Can I go this way?

428
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,970
(He goes to the waiting room.)

429
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,970
(Jae Seok follows him in secret.)

430
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,340
(He waits to attack when Haha is off guard.)

431
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,600
(Haha enters the waiting room.)

432
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,740
It's not over yet.

433
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,270
(He's fully prepared to reach level three.)

434
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,240
(It's his last chance.)

435
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,300
(Haha's waiting room)

436
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,300
(Agent Jae Seok arrives at Haha's hideout.)

437
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,870
(It's not over until it is.)

438
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,970
It's not over yet.

439
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,040
(Will Agent Jae Seok successfully attack his last target?)

440
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,800
Come on, you can't do this.

441
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,910
What do you mean?

442
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,140
You can't do this.

443
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,410
(Haha is completely defenseless.)

444
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,570
- I'm not even fully dressed. - What?

445
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,770
Come on.

446
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,240
- What's wrong? - I know you'll attack me,

447
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,940
but what are you hiding behind?

448
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,970
- What? - You're hiding something.

449
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,540
(Here's Agent Jae Seok's item.)

450
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,070
(It's a water gun.)

451
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,340
(He shoots.)

452
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,470
(Haha is angry.)

453
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,470
Okay, I'm leaving.

454
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,270
You jerk.

455
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,370
(What an annoying sniper.)

456
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,370
You're such a jerk.

457
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,370
- See you. - Stop filming!

458
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,300
(Agent Jae Seok reaches level three.)

459
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,370
Mission cleared.

460
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,340
Let's break up.

461
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,370
(Good job, everyone.)

462
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:32,970
(The final battle begins for the supernaturals.)

463
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,140
(Agent Jae Seok, level three)

464
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,100
(Black Widow Ji Hyo, level one)

465
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,940
(Avatar Kwang Soo, level two)

466
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,800
(Thor Jong Kook, level one)

467
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,240
(Detective Seok Jin, level two)

468
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,870
(Time Controller Haha, level one)

469
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,300
(Who will have the last laugh?)

470
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,540
(Prism Tower in Sangam)

471
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:01,200
(Ultimate Battle of Supernaturals equipped with superpowers)

472
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,970
(Who's the first supernatural?)

473
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,910
I'm Detective Seok Jin.

474
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,140
(He's the most observant.)

475
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,870
(It's Detective Seok Jin who hasn't reached his dream yet.)

476
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,670
It's Agent Jae Seok.

477
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,840
(He's the best spy despite his green outfit.)

478
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,970
Here's Agent Jae Seok.

479
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,640
(He's the best spy despite his green outfit.)

480
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,000
(Agent Jae Seok has a fake employment for 7 years.)

481
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,440
Is that your gun?

482
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,270
(He's invincible.)

483
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,410
Look at him.

484
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,910
(He moves like a robot.)

485
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,800
(It's Thor Jong Kook, the strongest of all.)

486
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,500
What kind of hammer is that?

487
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,410
(The hammer is smaller than his fist.)

488
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,570
Look at you.

489
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,740
- What's that? - Did you hear it break?

490
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,440
Do you want me to break you?

491
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,570
He looks so cute.

492
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,970
What's that?

493
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,070
Who's that?

494
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,000
Hello, I'm the hare from "The Tortoise and the Hare".

495
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,640
Are you a cartoon character?

496
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,070
I'm the time controller,

497
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,410
the rabbit from "Alice in Wonderland".

498
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,640
(It's Time Controller Haha, an idol for children.)

499
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,000
Did you open up a new bar?

500
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,200
(How dare you?)

501
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,770
- You look like a bartender. - His mission was terrible.

502
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,340
- Who's that? - Who's that?

503
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,640
Does that run?

504
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,870
(They're jealous of her toy car.)

505
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,770
- What are you doing? - Who are you?

506
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,170
Who are you?

507
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,670
- I'm Black Widow Ji Hyo. - Black Widow Ji Hyo?

508
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,340
(She's the beautiful Black Widow Ji Hyo.)

509
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,000
I'll go and park it.

510
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,540
It's valet parking.

511
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,870
(Jae Seok is kind.)

512
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,870
Reverse.

513
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,570
- I can't reverse it. - You can't fit in the space?

514
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,910
Come on.

515
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,570
(He's all over the place.)

516
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,100
Look at him.

517
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,600
- You're too playful. - What are you doing?

518
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
(He finally parks the car.)

519
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,770
I did it.

520
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,770
(What is this sound?)

521
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,140
(Kwang Soo says the word.)

522
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:55,440
(His superpower matches his outfit.)

523
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,070
(It's Avatar Kwang Soo who just arrived from Hollywood.)

524
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,370
- You went through a lot. - Why do you all look normal?

525
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,240
- He deserves Top Excellence Award. - That's not it.

526
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,000
He deserves the Grand Award.

527
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,440
Why is everyone else normal?

528
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,170
This suits you better. You're not an actor.

529
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,910
- What? - Don't even try.

530
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,440
(He's annoyed.)

531
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,240
Welcome, everyone.

532
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,140
Welcome to Ultimate Battle of Supernaturals.

533
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:25,470
Each of you reached a certain level by clearing missions.

534
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,670
We'll give you a chance to obtain additional superpowers.

535
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,140
Depending on the result, you'll win Superpower Exchange Cards.

536
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,940
Superpower level is based on how many cards you win.

537
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,300
It's best to win as many cards as possible.

538
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,240
- Here is the group mission. - What is it?

539
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:51,040
It's "Group Jump Rope" which all members will participate.

540
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,100
- Gosh. - I like that.

541
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,270
If you jump 10 times, you get 5. If you jump 20, you get 7.

542
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,870
The number of jumps determines the number of cards.

543
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,770
- Do we get one chance? - Yes.

544
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,900
(They only get one chance in "Group Jump Rope".)

545
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,900
- Let's determine the order. - Jae Seok goes first.

546
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,870
- I'll go first. - Does it start when we all jump?

547
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,100
- Let's hurry then. - Get ready.

548
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,240
- Please do well. - I'll start.

549
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,370
- Let's go. - We can do it.

550
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,900
- In 1, 2, 3, challenge. - Challenge!

551
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,070
We're good at this.

552
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,470
("Group Jump Rope" starts.)

553
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,870
All right, go.

554
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,240
Go next.

555
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,840
(The first and second are off to a good start.)

556
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,040
(Avatar Kwang Soo hesitates.)

557
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,540
(He joins without a problem.)

558
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,940
(Even Seok Jin joins safely.)

559
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,270
- I'm next. - Go.

560
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,600
- Wait. - Go.

561
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,340
- Hurry up. - Go now.

562
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,870
(You can do it.)

563
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,940
(Ji Hyo joins safely.)

564
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,870
(If Haha joins safely, they can start counting.)

565
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,140
Do we get one chance?

566
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,540
(All members jump the rope.)

567
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,000
- Six, seven, eight. - Turn the rope faster.

568
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,140
(Kwang Soo looks like an alien.)

569
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,100
(They win 5 Superpower Exchange Cards.)

570
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,100
(If they continue at this pace...)

571
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,800
(Someone trips.)

572
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,040
What happened?

573
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,940
We could have done 100.

574
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,840
You jumped 15 times.

575
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,140
We will...

576
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,770
(Kwang Soo takes it away.)

577
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,670
(It's too loud.)

578
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,570
That was my hammer.

579
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,640
What did you do?

580
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,770
- That was mine. - I'm sorry, but I'm too sensitive.

581
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,970
- Give it back to me. - My hearing is sensitive.

582
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,870
Give back my hammer.

583
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,870
Take out the batteries.

584
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,800
It needs to make sounds.

585
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,800
You jumped 15 times.

586
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,900
We'll give you five cards.

587
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,500
We only get five?

588
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,070
- We could have jumped more. - 30 jumps were possible.

589
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,670
- How do we share them? - How?

590
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,800
- Who tripped on the rope? - Check the camera recording.

591
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,800
To be honest, I shouldn't say this but...

592
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,300
("To be honest"?)

593
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,940
(Who tripped on the rope?)

594
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,600
I don't think Seok Jin skipped the rope at the end.

595
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,070
- I agree. - I'm being honest.

596
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,800
- He's right. - I'm being honest.

597
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,870
Am I not right?

598
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,400
- Right? - I agree.

599
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,040
- It wasn't me. - Let's be honest.

600
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,140
Don't replay the camera but...

601
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,370
it wasn't me.

602
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,000
(He's not convincing enough.)

603
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,000
- It's because... - Excuse me.

604
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,070
- It's because... - Be honest.

605
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,670
- Be honest. - It wasn't me.

606
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,970
You were the only one on this side. Everybody else jumped over.

607
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,070
- Give me one. - That was too obvious.

608
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,540
- Let's be honest. - Come on.

609
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,840
Weren't you behind me?

610
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,170
- I was. - See?

611
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,300
- It was you, then. - It wasn't.

612
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,140
- It wasn't me. - Fine. Give it to me.

613
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,340
- Let's do a lottery pick. - Okay.

614
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,870
- We had an even number. - Let's give him a chance.

615
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,900
- We'll let it go if you admit it. - Admit what?

616
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,670
We'll give you another chance if you admit your mistake.

617
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,540
- Admit it. - Well...

618
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,800
To be honest,

619
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,670
the rope got caught on my left foot.

620
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,170
Give it to me.

621
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,600
(Seok Jin is out.)

622
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,100
Give it to me.

623
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,770
- It's definite. - It was my mistake but...

624
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,000
- He admitted it. - He even lied.

625
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,740
- You can't do that. - He even lied.

626
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,570
- Let it go. - You made me confess.

627
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,200
I understand your point of view,

628
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,440
- but let's do a lottery pick. - We're one.

629
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,570
Hey.

630
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,340
(He collapses.)

631
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,270
- That's cheating. - His legs gave out.

632
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,840
His legs gave out.

633
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,840
(The elderly deserves some credit.)

634
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,100
- How does this sound? - What?

635
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,100
We'll ask the staff to place these cards in the rooms we were in.

636
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,870
- We'll pick which rooms to go in. - That works.

637
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,570
- That sounds fair, right? - That sounds fun.

638
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,740
If you open the door...

639
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,300
and there's no card, you don't get one.

640
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,870
It sounds like it's better to go first.

641
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,100
It's better to go at random...

642
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,870
- or go first. - I agree.

643
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:51,270
But if the first person goes and there's nothing, it's done.

644
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,940
Let's do rock, paper, scissors. Rock, paper, scissors.

645
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,940
(They do rock, paper, scissors.)

646
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,270
(Kwang Soo and Jae Seok win.)

647
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,370
Yes!

648
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:03,640
(The unlucky ones meet again.)

649
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,270
(Who will be the ultimate winner?)

650
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,870
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

651
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,800
(Avatar Kwang Soo wins.)

652
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,870
Yes!

653
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,640
(I'm going to pick the right one.)

654
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,270
(His unlucky DNA has been with him for 7 years.)

655
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,140
(Would be become the lucky icon of 2017?)

656
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,370
- It'll be crazy if he loses. - That would be.

657
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,740
Imagine having no card and looking like this.

658
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,700
- He'll look like a loser. - That'll be the best.

659
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,400
I pick R5!

660
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,070
(Avatar Kwang Soo chooses R5.)

661
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,370
- That's 5. - He chooses 5.

662
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,740
Okay. I think there'll be one.

663
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,070
I think so too.

664
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,800
There's a high possibility.

665
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,140
It's 5 out of 6.

666
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,640
(Opening)

667
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,940
(R5 has opened.)

668
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,470
(They get nervous.)

669
00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:00,200
(Is there an Exchange Card or not?)

670
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,200
(What?)

671
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,570
There's none.

672
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,870
(What? Why is there none?)

673
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,200
- There's none. - Really?

674
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,200
There's nothing.

675
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,340
There's none.

676
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,900
- There's none. - Really?

677
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,740
There's nothing.

678
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,140
- There's none. - How's this even possible?

679
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,540
- Hey. - I'll help you.

680
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,740
- There's actually nothing. - Hey.

681
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,440
- I pick three. - Let's look in the other ones.

682
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,940
- There's really nothing? - There's one here.

683
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,500
- There's one here. - Same here.

684
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,870
- There is. - My goodness.

685
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,440
- This is insane. - Kwang Soo.

686
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,070
Should I turn time back for you?

687
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,140
- How's this possible? - Do you want me to turn time back?

688
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,940
- How could this be? - My gosh.

689
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,770
This is insane.

690
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,470
- How could this be? - This is impossible.

691
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:42,040
I can't be as unlucky as him.

692
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,440
You're unbelievable.

693
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,370
You shouldn't do anything this year.

694
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:48,070
What? What do you mean I shouldn't do anything?

695
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,270
Just appear on variety shows.

696
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,700
The next game is "One on One Match".

697
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,900
("One on One Match")

698
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,540
You'll be given keywords related to the game you'll be playing.

699
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,370
You can then choose the person you'll be playing against...

700
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:03,070
and conduct a one on one match.

701
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,800
However, you must bet your Superpower Exchange Card.

702
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,840
If you win, you get two times the numbers of cards you bet.

703
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,500
If you lose, they'll be taken away.

704
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,570
Go ahead and pick.

705
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,140
- Who would like to go first? - I'll go.

706
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,370
Sure. Go ahead, Kwang Soo.

707
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,670
- Kwang Soo. - Let's keep going like this.

708
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,670
- Blue ball. - All right.

709
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,840
They're all blue.

710
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,040
They're all blue.

711
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,970
(Whose name is written in the first ball?)

712
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,140
- Jee Seok Jin. - Jee Seok Jin.

713
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,300
(Seok Jin's name is written on the ball.)

714
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,440
- Do I go first? - Seok Jin has to pick.

715
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,700
We're not facing each other?

716
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,000
You're not.

717
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,700
- Seok Jin goes first. - I'm the first to go, right?

718
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,240
- Go Seok Jin. - Okay.

719
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,670
The first keyword is...

720
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,270
- "vision". - He has bad vision.

721
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,540
- If you take your glasses off... - Do I have to take them off?

722
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,370
No, you wouldn't look good if you took them off.

723
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,870
Why wouldn't we look good?

724
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,600
- What are you talking out? - What's the point, then?

725
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,870
What do you mean we wouldn't look good?

726
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,400
We should all take them off.

727
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,740
My goodness.

728
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,870
Who has bad vision here?

729
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,970
Kwang Soo's pretty bad but he's wearing contact lenses.

730
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,640
- Right. - Choose whom you'll be playing.

731
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,370
Song Ji Hyo.

732
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,740
(He chooses Black Widow Ji Hyo.)

733
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,540
We've played it many times.

734
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,770
I pick Ji Hyo.

735
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,970
(Black Widow Ji Hyo vs Detective Seok Jin)

736
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,800
Bring in the game.

737
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:22,770
(What kind of "vision game" could this be?)

738
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,800
(There's a steel container.)

739
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,870
("Steel Container Game")

740
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,870
- I'm an expert in this. - That's right.

741
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,600
I am.

742
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,070
He used to do this on "Achieve the Goal Saturday".

743
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,700
(It makes use of Agent Jae Seok's agility.)

744
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,240
(Any agent should be able to do this.)

745
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,340
You can only see this if you try hard enough.

746
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:47,370
If you stay still, you won't be able to find out.

747
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,600
(Detective Seok Jin bets 2 cards.)

748
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,970
(Black Widow Ji Hyo bets 1.)

749
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,200
Ready.

750
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,170
(The game starts.)

751
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,600
(Lifting)

752
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,570
(Their gazes are fixed on it.)

753
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:02,540
(He does his tricks.)

754
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,840
- He's so fast. - There's nothing.

755
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,240
How silly.

756
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,670
How many are there?

757
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,870
- It's behind. - It must be on top.

758
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,970
Hey, I can't see anything.

759
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,240
(Peekaboo)

760
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,340
I saw it.

761
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,770
(They spot something.)

762
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,970
You can see it, right?

763
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,240
A pill.

764
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,640
(Black Widow Ji Hyo makes a guess.)

765
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,670
Incorrect.

766
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,840
Listen. The container is faced this way so you need to come here.

767
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,770
Why would you stay there?

768
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,770
(The steel container is tightly secured.)

769
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,870
You need to come here. That's right.

770
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,270
You can only see this if you work hard for it.

771
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,900
I open it like this.

772
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,040
(Is the door open?)

773
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,270
Look.

774
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,570
(The other members are curious too.)

775
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,670
He's so bold.

776
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,940
Is this some kind of trick?

777
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,540
- Is that what this is? - Look.

778
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:46,970
(Turning)

779
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,200
(They can't stand it anymore.)

780
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,770
Can we go up?

781
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,440
You can't be so far away.

782
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,400
Not too close, though. That's good.

783
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,340
I'm opening it.

784
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,070
I keep opening like this. See? Look.

785
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,670
- Look. - He's doing it in a new way.

786
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,240
- See? - Hey.

787
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,670
(For goodness' sake!)

788
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,070
- My gosh. - What's wrong?

789
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,240
What are you doing?

790
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,000
You have to leave it open until we can see it.

791
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,440
I'm so mad.

792
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,870
- I saw it a few times. - What am I doing?

793
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,500
You have to keep following me.

794
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,600
(They take a breather.)

795
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,000
I'll reveal it this time. Here I go, Ji Hyo.

796
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,640
(He takes the lid off.)

797
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,900
(As soon as you see it first, you'll win.)

798
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,300
(What?)

799
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,540
(His spins are becoming fancier.)

800
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,370
(You have eyes so why can't you see it?)

801
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,570
- I can't see any of it. - Me neither.

802
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,570
(He adds more tricks.)

803
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:44,570
(He must have learned a lot from the agent academy.)

804
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,440
(Spinning)

805
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,500
(Spinning)

806
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,470
(Up, down, up, up, down)

807
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,340
(You little...)

808
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,270
(Game on?)

809
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,900
What is he doing?

810
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,370
(Back and forth)

811
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,540
(Have you heard of the tornado skill?)

812
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,000
(Once you take the punch, you're done for good.)

813
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,500
(He's the best master out there.)

814
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,000
(It's an honor to meet you, Master.)

815
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,170
- What was that? - He looks so cool.

816
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,570
What are you doing?

817
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,970
(Martial arts should have been his superpower.)

818
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,140
(His wrist snaps are getting better and better.)

819
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,500
- What's this? - What's this?

820
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,700
I think you two need to see a doctor.

821
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,370
Bubble gum. It's bubble gum.

822
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,600
(He repeatedly flips it over.)

823
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,900
(You have to get it this time.)

824
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,670
(If you win, you get double the number of cards you bet.)

825
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,870
- Pebbles. - What?

826
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,340
(The answer is "pebbles".)

827
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,600
You saw that?

828
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,870
- I knew it from the beginning. - They're pebbles.

829
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:49,540
- They're pebbles. - I knew it from the beginning.

830
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,870
- I thought it was a hair tie. - I thought it was an eraser.

831
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,900
It was so obvious.

832
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,040
I thought it was a colorful hair tie.

833
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,870
- I saw the color. - You have to focus to see it.

834
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,570
(Ji Hyo gets 2 cards and Seok Jin loses 2.)

835
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,840
- The second game... - I'll pick.

836
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,270
Seok Jin.

837
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,270
(Hitting)

838
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:08,440
- You can't do that. - What did I do?

839
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,300
(Ta-da)

840
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,940
That looks fun.

841
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,400
Lee Kwang Soo.

842
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,870
(Next person to play is Avatar Kwang Soo.)

843
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,000
Keyword for the next game...

844
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,200
What is it?

845
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:27,300
(Next keyword is "senses".)

846
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,040
- What is it? - Senses.

847
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,370
I think I know this.

848
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:32,370
- I hate this game. - You have to stick your hand in.

849
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,370
I know this one.

850
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,000
- You have to stick your hand in. - Haha.

851
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,770
No, don't. Go with Jae Seok.

852
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,300
(I choose you.)

853
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,500
- Please. - No.

854
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,500
I pick you.

855
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,470
It has to be you.

856
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,040
(Time Controller Haha vs Avatar Kwang Soo)

857
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:52,070
(Avatar Kwang Soo bets 1 Superpower Exchange Card.)

858
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,670
(Haha bets 1 as well.)

859
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,400
This game is called "Cheek to Cheek".

860
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,540
There'll be an object placed between your cheeks.

861
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,870
You must only use your sense of touch to guess what it is.

862
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,540
Whoever guesses it correctly wins that round.

863
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,240
The one who wins twice first will be the winner.

864
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,810
- Okay, shall we... - Are you ready?

865
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,470
Why did you pick me?

866
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,940
Because you're bad at this.

867
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,400
(What will be the first item?)

868
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,940
(Gosh)

869
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,040
(Why?)

870
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,570
I'm so disappointed.

871
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:24,200
(The first shocking item is here.)

872
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,000
Oh, my.

873
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,540
- This is not okay. - This is too...

874
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,570
(Here we go.)

875
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,670
(Yu Jae Seok?)

876
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,040
This is not okay.

877
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,500
(They have to feel Jae Seok with their cheeks.)

878
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,340
- This is too much. - It is.

879
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,970
- This is not okay. - This is too much.

880
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,670
(Nervous)

881
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,700
- This kind of thing... - I'm not going to be fooled.

882
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,640
I'm not going to be fooled, but it's still annoying.

883
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,840
(Feel Jae Seok between your cheeks.)

884
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,770
- We mean it. - Let me tell you.

885
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:01,740
When you find out the answer, you'll be so annoyed.

886
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,500
- I'm not sure they can do it. - I know.

887
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,470
- We should win twice first? - Are you ready?

888
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,100
Let's go.

889
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,670
Gosh, I'm scared.

890
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,900
Is it here.

891
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,370
(Will they get it right?)

892
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,770
Please tell me when you touch it.

893
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,840
It's coming now.

894
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,340
Tell me beforehand.

895
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,770
(Touching)

896
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,870
(What are you guys doing?)

897
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,340
(It's forbidden love that goes beyond gender and race.)

898
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,370
(They start feeling each other's cheeks.)

899
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,700
What are you doing?

900
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,370
Someone licked my nose.

901
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,400
(Someone licked my nose.)

902
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,000
(Hilarious)

903
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,100
I mean...

904
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,310
I felt some hair.

905
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:52,470
There's hair.

906
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,500
(Haha's mustache felt like a hairy monster.)

907
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,000
That's strange.

908
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,770
(Kwang Soo's lips felt like a monster's tentacles.)

909
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,240
Gosh.

910
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,440
I mean...

911
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,070
(Here it really comes.)

912
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,770
Start. It's there.

913
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,500
Where is it? I can't find it.

914
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,970
(Kiss)

915
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,740
(He escapes.)

916
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,370
(It rekindles the forbidden love.)

917
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,470
- Wait. - Where is it?

918
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Where is it?

919
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,400
(Gosh, it's disgusting.)

920
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,200
- Here it comes. - Here it comes.

921
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,700
Is this the thing?

922
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,140
It's there.

923
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,700
(Kwang Soo sticks out his tongue.)

924
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,570
(It's the sweetest kiss in the world.)

925
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,200
(Jae Seok is blushing.)

926
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,100
- Don't stick out your tongue. - I know the answer.

927
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:46,200
(Did Haha already figure out that it's Jae Seok?)

928
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,470
- Pig skin. - It's wrong.

929
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,810
(It felt like pig skin.)

930
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,870
I thought it was something else.

931
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,470
(Does my skin feel like food?)

932
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,310
Ready.

933
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,400
Let's go.

934
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,070
(Jae Seok gets hurt many times today.)

935
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:02,740
Here it comes.

936
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,770
What is this?

937
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,570
I felt some hair.

938
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,940
(After kissing the microphone, Kwang Soo is shocked.)

939
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,240
There's hair.

940
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,900
(After kissing the microphone, Kwang Soo is shocked.)

941
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,310
(What kind of mammal did I just kiss?)

942
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,200
I told you you'd be annoyed.

943
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,810
You'll be really annoyed.

944
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,440
Here it comes.

945
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,500
I know the answer.

946
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,810
- I know the answer. - What is it?

947
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,200
- Was that it? - What's your guess?

948
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,200
(Will he get it right this time?)

949
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,370
Yu Jae Seok.

950
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,700
(Correct)

951
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,700
Is it right?

952
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,200
(He feels disgusted.)

953
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,770
- Was it you? - Hey.

954
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,600
Why did you feel my face with your tongue?

955
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,310
- It was... - I thought it was food.

956
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,640
The second item will be ready soon.

957
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,310
- Broccoli. - Correct.

958
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,100
(Kwang Soo wins the second round.)

959
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,170
Here we go.

960
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,870
(What's the last item?)

961
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,940
Here we go.

962
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,310
(Watch how they react.)

963
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:05,100
- This is too... - This is too much.

964
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,940
- This is too... - This is too much.

965
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,370
- It's alive, I swear. - Did you hear how Ji Hyo reacted?

966
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,000
- It's alive, I swear. - Did you hear how Ji Hyo reacted?

967
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,140
(What are you?)

968
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,200
This is too...

969
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
(Abalone)

970
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,870
(It's too alive.)

971
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:26,870
(Here comes fresh abalone.)

972
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,700
- Is it here? - Yes.

973
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,470
It's cold.

974
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:34,000
(Why is it moist?)

975
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,970
Don't get too close too fast.

976
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,270
You'll hurt your face.

977
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,200
(Gosh)

978
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:42,000
I can't tell if it's your tongue or the item.

979
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,600
I didn't stick out my tongue.

980
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,400
- Don't stick out your tongue. - I didn't.

981
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,970
Hey, you sucked my eye earlier.

982
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,840
- I didn't suck it. - I did?

983
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,240
- Hey. - That's not true.

984
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,570
Your tongue touched my eyes.

985
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:55,840
There was some hair.

986
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,700
(They try again.)

987
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,100
Change the direction a little.

988
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,340
What?

989
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,100
(Biting)

990
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,240
(It's love beyond race again.)

991
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,500
What's this?

992
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,310
Look at him.

993
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,000
Kwang Soo.

994
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:15,470
(Biting)

995
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,840
- Stop it. - Is he eating it?

996
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,100
(Stop eating it.)

997
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,870
(I haven't had enough.)

998
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,500
(I need to take a big bite.)

999
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,810
Is he eating it?

1000
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,900
(Licking)

1001
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,310
(He's tasting Haha.)

1002
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,900
Stop licking.

1003
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,370
I know the answer.

1004
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:47,140
(Did he figure it out?)

1005
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,840
- Abalone. - Correct.

1006
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,940
(Correct)

1007
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,400
(Kwang Soo beats Haha 2 to 1.)

1008
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,810
Gosh.

1009
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,140
(We thank Kwang Soo's tongue, the abalone, and Jae Seok.)

1010
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,540
- Gosh. - You're disgusting.

1011
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,100
(Kwang Soo has 3 Superpower Exchange Cards now.)

1012
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,700
- It's time for the last game. - Let's go.

1013
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,600
- Is it between Jong Kook and me? - They're the only ones left.

1014
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,570
- It'll be only one round. - What is it?

1015
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,000
Face each other...

1016
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,770
and take turns putting clothespins on each other's faces.

1017
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:20,240
The one who screams first loses.

1018
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,670
Decide who will go first by rock, paper, scissors.

1019
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,400
This is Jae Seok's hobby.

1020
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,440
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

1021
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,170
The winner goes first.

1022
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:29,340
- I'll bet one. - I'll do the same.

1023
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,740
No. I'll bet two.

1024
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,970
You're determined to win.

1025
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:37,310
Someone might have broken my record by now,

1026
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:39,700
I have a Guinness World Record...

1027
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,700
for putting 28 clothespins on my face.

1028
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,400
You could scream then.

1029
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,000
Yes, I was screaming.

1030
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,270
Eyelids will hurt.

1031
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,840
Start.

1032
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,770
(Where will Jong Kook's first clothespin end up?)

1033
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,240
- Do I go first? - Yes.

1034
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,310
(Where will Jong Kook's first clothespin end up?)

1035
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,400
- Look at him. - Are you starting there?

1036
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,310
- He's... - From the beginning?

1037
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:01,900
(There?)

1038
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:06,100
(Jong Kook is confident.)

1039
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,740
(It's on his eyelid.)

1040
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,570
He's standing it.

1041
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,570
- Jae Seok. - He's thinking.

1042
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,840
Don't think too much.

1043
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,740
Don't hesitate.

1044
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,100
(Coughing)

1045
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,670
What's the point?

1046
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,370
The nest one will go to your right eyelid.

1047
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,470
(Jong Kook is nervous.)

1048
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,600
Can you really stand it?

1049
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,000
How much does it hurt?

1050
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,940
(Jae Seok attacks this time.)

1051
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,770
- I don't think that will hurt. - Oh, my.

1052
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,370
(He's not good at attacking.)

1053
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,440
All right.

1054
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,970
Please.

1055
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,600
- He's a devil. - This is too much.

1056
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,740
How could he start from there?

1057
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,340
Oh, my.

1058
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,470
It's barely hanging there.

1059
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:51,100
- Just give up. - Please.

1060
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,870
(Someone's squeezing my eyes.)

1061
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:55,040
My stomach hurts.

1062
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,770
He looks like a cartoon character.

1063
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:58,040
(He's dancing to "TT".)

1064
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,310
They look like tears.

1065
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,870
Just scream and get it over with.

1066
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:03,140
(It's too much.)

1067
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,600
They're dangling.

1068
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,940
Can you see anything?

1069
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:10,140
I can't see anything.

1070
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,470
(Gosh, I can't see anything.)

1071
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,840
(She's cracking up.)

1072
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,740
Take revenge.

1073
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,500
(Here I go.)

1074
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,400
That won't hurt. You should get back at him.

1075
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,000
That should hurt.

1076
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,400
(He's so bad at attacking.)

1077
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,700
- It's over now. - Are you sure?

1078
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,900
(Where will the next clothespin go?)

1079
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,470
There again?

1080
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,970
(It's the eyelid again.)

1081
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,810
Oh, my. That's not okay.

1082
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:46,600
(It's a new year, but I can't see anything.)

1083
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,570
(Soon, a kid will be hanging from his eyelid.)

1084
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:49,600
That's not okay.

1085
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,770
(Soon, a kid will be hanging from his eyelid.)

1086
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:53,500
Drink some water.

1087
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,700
Drink water.

1088
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,840
Gosh.

1089
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,400
(Jae Seok gives up.)

1090
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,640
Take them off.

1091
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,810
(Screaming)

1092
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:07,840
(Jong Kook now has four Superpower Exchange Cards.)

1093
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,670
You can exchange the Superpower Exchange Cards you have now...

1094
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,140
with supernatural powers.

1095
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:17,770
In the armory are three different kinds of boxes.

1096
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,600
What you can have is determined by the number of your cards.

1097
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,570
Each box has a different supernatural power.

1098
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:28,640
You'll choose one randomly...

1099
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,840
and use it in the final round.

1100
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:35,000
(Jae Seok goes in first.)

1101
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,500
I only have three.

1102
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,840
(Jae Seok has three Superpower Exchange Cards.)

1103
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:42,600
(He needs to make a rational decision.)

1104
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:47,140
(Should I get one of each?)

1105
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,370
I'll choose a gold box.

1106
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,840
(Gold boxes are the strongest. What will he get?)

1107
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,570
It's a Death Note Card.

1108
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,670
(Death Note Card)

1109
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:03,500
I guess 1 gold box will be better than 1 silver and 1 bronze.

1110
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,800
(Ji Hyo chooses a gold box as well.)

1111
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,740
(What is the additional superpower Ji Hyo has picked?)

1112
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:17,800
You can choose one.

1113
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,200
(Seok Jin has only one Superpower Exchange Card.)

1114
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,840
(He has obtained this superpower with the bronze box.)

1115
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,040
It's GPS Card.

1116
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,840
(GPS Card reveals the location of a member via walkie-talkie.)

1117
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,600
(Haha has only one Superpower Exchange Card.)

1118
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,770
This is nice.

1119
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,770
(He has obtained Blinding Card.)

1120
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,440
I have three cards.

1121
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,700
(He owns 3 Superpower Exchange Cards.)

1122
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,170
I have to use them all here, right?

1123
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,300
(Avatar Kwang Soo chooses the gold box.)

1124
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:51,370
(What is the extra superpower that surprised Avatar Kwang Soo?)

1125
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:57,840
(Exchanging superpowers is over. Who will win this Ultimate Battle?)

1126
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:02,000
The final war of the Ultimate Battle of Supernaturals will start.

1127
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,170
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1128
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:06,770
(Agent Jae Seok's ability is level 3 and he uses a big water gun.)

1129
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,500
(Black Widow Ji Hyo's level of superpower is 1.)

1130
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,240
(She can pause a member for 1 minute and run away.)

1131
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,700
Does this look weirder without it?

1132
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,940
(Avatar Kwang Soo's level of superpower is 2.)

1133
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,840
(Thor Jong Kook's superpower level is 1.)

1134
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,770
(He can double the size of a name tag.)

1135
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,270
I will disappear in front of you.

1136
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:21,370
(Detective Seok Jin's superpower level is 2.)

1137
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:23,370
(Time Controller Haha's superpower level is 1.)

1138
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:24,970
(He can rewind 10 seconds.)

1139
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:27,600
(The final war starts.)

1140
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,000
In the final war of the Ultimate Battle of Supernaturals,

1141
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,070
the last member, who survives after everyone is eliminated, will win.

1142
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:40,500
But if this week's participant wins, the prize will be doubled.

1143
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,870
The rest of you will face a punishment.

1144
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,740
I have to eliminate the participant for this week's episode.

1145
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,740
In addition, a special room has been prepared.

1146
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,000
You can either strengthen...

1147
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,370
or lose your superpower in this room.

1148
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,670
(Finding Reinforcement Room, which will appear randomly, is crucial.)

1149
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:58,900
It's like a secret room.

1150
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,400
(It's more crucial for supernaturals with lower levels.)

1151
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,300
I should find the Reinforcement Room and improve my power.

1152
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,470
(Haha is also wandering around to look for the Reinforcement Room.)

1153
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:07,570
Will it be here?

1154
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:10,800
I have to find that room,

1155
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,470
but I may lose my power.

1156
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:16,500
(Agent Jae Seok walks quietly.)

1157
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,670
(People are talking.)

1158
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,140
(Shall I start wetting them with my water gun?)

1159
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:29,040
The rest of the members don't have to...

1160
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,840
(Jae Seok targets Seok Jin who is usually clueless.)

1161
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:33,600
(Approaching)

1162
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:38,270
You startled me. Hey!

1163
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:40,070
You can't start shooting now.

1164
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:41,600
You won't shoot me, right?

1165
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,670
What's your superpower?

1166
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:44,840
- My superpower? - Yes.

1167
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,500
- I shouldn't tell you that, right? - No, you shouldn't.

1168
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,000
Then why do you ask?

1169
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,770
- Why were you about to answer? - Well...

1170
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,570
- You're not the participant, right? - No, I am not.

1171
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,970
- It's not my week. - It's not.

1172
00:46:57,970 --> 00:46:59,300
I think it's Kwang Soo's.

1173
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,340
- Symbol of power. - There's Haha.

1174
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,640
(Haha appears.)

1175
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,740
Cross!

1176
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,200
- Power. - Speed.

1177
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,370
- Cross! - Cross!

1178
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,240
(He retreats instinctively.)

1179
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:13,900
I shouldn't provoke them first.

1180
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,600
(It's better to avoid members who play dirty.)

1181
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,900
My goodness.

1182
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:23,800
If I shoot, it will be the end of me.

1183
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,140
I'm certain there will be someone who controls time.

1184
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:27,840
I can't use it until then.

1185
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,270
What should I do?

1186
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:32,940
(Agent Jae Seok is contemplating.)

1187
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,440
(At the same time,)

1188
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:38,100
(Avatar Kwang Soo is still looking for Reinforcement Room.)

1189
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:39,940
(I have to strengthen my power quickly.)

1190
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,570
(He spots Thor Jong Kook from a distance.)

1191
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,370
- Hey. Kwang Soo. - Yes, Jong Kook?

1192
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,870
- Kwang Soo. - Come here, Kwang Soo.

1193
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,740
Kwang Soo.

1194
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,270
It's Jong Kook. It's him.

1195
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:54,670
(Alert for Thor Jong Kook is issued.)

1196
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:57,800
Let's stop the participant from winning first.

1197
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,800
Who do you think came up with this theme?

1198
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,900
- Jae Seok. - It's Jae Seok.

1199
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,940
- I think so, too. - Didn't I predict accurately?

1200
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,370
- Jae Seok thinks it's Kwang Soo. - No, it's not him.

1201
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:09,500
Compared to our missions, his mission was too easy.

1202
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:14,600
(He strolled around Sangam-dong, butting in their missions.)

1203
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:19,300
(After eliminating everyone, he put his superpower in the 3rd level.)

1204
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,970
(His mission did seem noticeably easy.)

1205
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,470
I predict it's Jae Seok's week. I am not certain, though.

1206
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,470
(At the same time, he's filming a spy movie all by himself.)

1207
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,970
Before he is eliminated,

1208
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:37,700
we shouldn't be separated.

1209
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,400
- We have to avoid the punishment. - Let's not leave each other.

1210
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,940
- I agree. - I heard it's terrible.

1211
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,070
Haha, why are you doing that?

1212
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:43,170
(Talking)

1213
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,270
(He stops.)

1214
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:48,040
(Turning back)

1215
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,400
I can't shoot when they're all together.

1216
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,540
(I should be extra careful today.)

1217
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:51,600
That will be the end of me.

1218
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,400
What I hate the most is...

1219
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:57,140
I have to compete against you with just my superpower.

1220
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,240
Can you stop this?

1221
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:00,100
Give it back.

1222
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,040
This is the best part of it. This is what's keeping me happy.

1223
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,700
We are talking about something important.

1224
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,240
(This is my hammer.)

1225
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:07,770
That's bothering me.

1226
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,800
(Hammering)

1227
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,340
It doesn't do anything. It's really nothing.

1228
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,600
Stop it.

1229
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,240
It's the only fun part about this.

1230
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,070
- It does something, right? - All right.

1231
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:19,400
It doesn't do anything.

1232
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,540
- I will break this. - I swear. It doesn't do anything.

1233
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,740
- Let's find the room, Ji Hyo. - Let's find that first.

1234
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,170
- Okay. Let's do that. - Let's find the Reinforcement Room.

1235
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:27,340
(He's being careful.)

1236
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:32,100
(I think they are coming this way.)

1237
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,200
(Seok Jin spots Jae Seok.)

1238
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,270
Jae Seok.

1239
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:39,800
- It's your week, right? - What?

1240
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:41,400
It's not my week.

1241
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,470
You are in danger.

1242
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:44,900
I will tell you something as your old friend.

1243
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:46,170
You are in danger.

1244
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,570
I heard you encourage others to eliminate me first.

1245
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:51,170
(I know I am in danger.)

1246
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,000
I didn't say that.

1247
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,500
You said it right there.

1248
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,370
Stop lying.

1249
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:59,200
I heard it. That's why I was leaving.

1250
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:00,900
- Did you hear it? - Yes.

1251
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,700
(He talked with Jong Kook minutes ago.)

1252
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,400
- I had my week. - It's not me as well. Shouldn't...

1253
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,070
Shouldn't we eliminate Jae Seok first?

1254
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,940
(Listening)

1255
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,340
Seok Jin just said I should be eliminated first.

1256
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,240
- When did you hear it? - You said I must be removed first.

1257
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:18,840
You said that to Jong Kook.

1258
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,940
You are so funny.

1259
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,440
- You were listening? - Yes.

1260
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,940
I don't know if you believe me, but it's not me.

1261
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,900
(To communicate with the room, he wanders around.)

1262
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:36,170
(There's an object that looks like a room.)

1263
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,840
(No one's here, right?)

1264
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:40,900
(Avatar Kwang Soo finds Reinforcement Room.)

1265
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:45,140
(If he's successful, he can upgrade his 2nd level to the 3rd level.)

1266
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:49,470
(However, if he fails, he will lose the superpower he has now.)

1267
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,600
(Should I do it or not?)

1268
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,700
(Haha gets close to the Reinforcement Room.)

1269
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,640
(Here comes Haha.)

1270
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,040
- Did you succeed? - Yes, I did.

1271
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,600
(How brazen.)

1272
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:02,370
- Don't lie. - I'm not lying.

1273
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,600
- You are not? - I am not.

1274
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,940
- Did you upgrade your power? - Yes.

1275
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,770
- Is it closed? - It's not closed.

1276
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,500
Come on.

1277
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,770
(I knew it.)

1278
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:16,700
- Why do you lie? - You know I was here first.

1279
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,440
- I came in first. - What is wrong with you?

1280
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,600
- I was here first. - You...

1281
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,000
If you fail, let me try.

1282
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,400
I found it first.

1283
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,200
- Then why don't you try it? - Let me make a call first.

1284
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:31,370
What is he doing? He's not doing it.

1285
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:34,700
- Yes, Kwang Soo. - Ji Hyo.

1286
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,270
- What? - Where are you?

1287
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,870
I am in the main building.

1288
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:41,700
I found the Reinforcement Room. Do you want to come?

1289
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,340
Why would you want me there?

1290
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:46,200
- What? - What are you doing?

1291
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:47,870
Don't come, Ji Hyo.

1292
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:49,140
You must come.

1293
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,440
Why would I go there? Where are you?

1294
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,440
Ji Hyo, you can strengthen your superpower.

1295
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,040
(I'm wondering if I can take your superpower.)

1296
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:59,200
(Kwang Soo acquired the ability to control Ji Hyo's superpower.)

1297
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,700
(Ji Hyo's superpower is Kwang Soo's superpower.)

1298
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,370
Where are you?

1299
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,400
Come to the annex on the fourth floor.

1300
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,770
- If he fails... - Okay.

1301
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,940
(Ji Hyo, you will come to see me, right?)

1302
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:20,500
(You will also successfully improve your superpower, right?)

1303
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,440
- What? - It's there.

1304
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:25,400
What is it?

1305
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,740
It's the Reinforcement Room. I didn't use it yet.

1306
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:28,700
You can strengthen your power.

1307
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:29,970
(Why is he being so helpful today?)

1308
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:35,470
(It looks suspicious, but can't you just reinforce your power?)

1309
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:36,600
You should use it.

1310
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,170
- What? - You should use this room.

1311
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,770
It's pointless for me.

1312
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:41,970
Why is it pointless for you?

1313
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:43,440
- My level of superpower is three. - What?

1314
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,900
- My power is in the 3rd level. - Really?

1315
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,040
I'm fine without it.

1316
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,200
(But I am not fine with that.)

1317
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,540
I don't think so.

1318
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,440
Why?

1319
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,700
Can I try?

1320
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,100
- You can try. - No, you can't.

1321
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,240
He said I can't.

1322
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,900
Why are they clustered there?

1323
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,070
What is it?

1324
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:04,200
You startled me.

1325
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,140
- It's the room. - Something's fishy about him.

1326
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:08,800
He keeps telling me to go in, but Seok Jin can't.

1327
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:11,140
If one of you wants to come in...

1328
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,470
(Shall I give you a massage with my hammer?)

1329
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:15,040
- Why are you guarding it? - That's exactly my point.

1330
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,600
- He's acting strangely. - I didn't...

1331
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,070
- It's just... - Shall I get rid of his name tag?

1332
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,840
Let's do it so that we can be comfortable.

1333
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,270
Do I make you uncomfortable?

1334
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:22,400
I mean...

1335
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,100
How can you say such things? You're making me sad.

1336
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,700
Look at my clothes.

1337
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,340
- I will remove your name tag. - Jong Kook.

1338
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:30,300
- All you want is for me to go in? - You can go in...

1339
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,040
and it might be better if you can strengthen your superpower.

1340
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,100
(You are falling for my trap.)

1341
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,500
But why does it have to be her?

1342
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,500
- You don't make sense. - Maybe he can exchange...

1343
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,500
- his power with yours. - It's doesn't add up.

1344
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:44,070
- I can't understand this. - This is good for you, Ji Hyo.

1345
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:47,840
It's good for you. So stop talking and go in already.

1346
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,170
- I'll just go in. - Fine. I will go in first.

1347
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:52,640
Okay. I will go in.

1348
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,900
Ji Hyo. Practice. Practice before you try it.

1349
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:59,800
Practice. Adjust your power when you spin it.

1350
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,470
This is so funny.

1351
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,270
Practice until you get the hang of it.

1352
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,900
I'll start.

1353
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,140
You know what to do with this. You turn it.

1354
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:16,770
(If she fails, Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo both lose their superpowers.)

1355
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:21,400
(Will it be an upgrade or a co-destruction?)

1356
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,000
(Black Widow Ji Hyo fails.)

1357
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:27,700
(I failed. What should I do?)

1358
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,040
Don't even think about it.

1359
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:32,370
Come here. What happened?

1360
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,470
I lost everything because of you.

1361
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:36,440
I lost everything because of you.

1362
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:39,170
(Are you serious?)

1363
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:40,670
- Ji Hyo. - You lost everything?

1364
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:42,640
- Ji Hyo. - Did you lose everything too?

1365
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,670
- You scumbag. - Let's just...

1366
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,300
Did you say scumbag?

1367
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,970
You scumbag. It's because of you...

1368
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,200
that I lost everything.

1369
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:53,070
What are you talking about.

1370
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:56,200
You shouldn't only think about yourself.

1371
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,370
(The unluckiness is infectious.)

1372
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:00,100
(Jae Seok hears some noise.)

1373
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,040
They are still there.

1374
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:07,470
(In that case...)

1375
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:10,070
(Crouching)

1376
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:12,740
Hide.

1377
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:18,040
(He lowers his body and tells the cameraman to stay behind.)

1378
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,700
(Now that everything is in place, he is ready.)

1379
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:27,000
(Pressing)

1380
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:34,800
(He leaves the cameraman and takes the elevator alone.)

1381
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:38,200
(Where are you going without me?)

1382
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,670
(Cameraman Kwon Ryeol and the staff are retreating for the moment.)

1383
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:44,970
- Let's go for now. - We can't even start.

1384
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:48,800
It's relaxing to be with people that don't want your name tag.

1385
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,940
Sure.

1386
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,640
- Where should we go next? - That way?

1387
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:53,740
- Where should we go next? - That way?

1388
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,600
Let's go down the stairs.

1389
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,000
I think there's someone here.

1390
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,170
(Aren't you Kwon Ryeol?)

1391
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:02,240
- Jae Seok is here somewhere... - Where?

1392
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:03,670
because Kwon Ryeol is here.

1393
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,640
(I'm sorry, Jae Seok.)

1394
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,000
Jae Seok is here.

1395
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,370
He's here.

1396
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:11,170
(Passing by)

1397
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,670
(Where are you going so suspiciously?)

1398
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:17,970
- Hey. - What?

1399
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:19,870
(He is keeping quiet while pressing the close button.)

1400
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:21,540
- Hey. - Why?

1401
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:23,840
He's here? He's here.

1402
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,040
(Jae Seok, why won't you open the door?)

1403
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:28,500
(She presses the button.)

1404
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:30,640
(I should move downstairs to be safe.)

1405
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,900
- So he went down. - He went down.

1406
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:35,300
- He went down. - He went with Kwon Ryeol.

1407
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:37,700
Kwon Ryeol was here.

1408
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:38,970
He went down with Kwon Ryeol.

1409
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:40,500
He's here. Come here, Haha.

1410
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:44,370
- Have you seen Jae Seok? - I followed him up the stairs.

1411
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:46,800
He went downstairs on the elevator.

1412
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,400
Without the cameraman?

1413
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,700
Is Kwon Ryeol following him?

1414
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,740
- Let's go. - Let's follow Kwon Ryeol.

1415
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:54,400
Let's run!

1416
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,200
- I have to do something. - Be quick.

1417
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:58,600
- Kwang Soo. - Let's have a talk.

1418
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:02,340
(Where there is Kwon Ryeol, there is Agent Jae Seok.)

1419
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:03,640
Is this the third floor?

1420
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:07,400
(Jae Seok arrives downstairs without knowing anything.)

1421
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:12,100
(Sorry, Kwon Ryeol. I'm here.)

1422
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,540
(I see you, Agent Jae Seok.)

1423
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,340
Is this the third floor?

1424
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:20,540
(This is one hectic, wild goose chase!)

1425
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,540
(He's running away while trying to take Kwon Ryeol with him.)

1426
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:29,300
(Is this the end?)

1427
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,600
Hey. Hey.

1428
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,240
(The Kwon Ryeol followers have arrived.)

1429
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,370
Listen to me.

1430
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:36,770
It's not me. It's really not me.

1431
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:38,470
- It's you or Haha. - Kwang Soo.

1432
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,170
It's you or Haha.

1433
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:42,040
- What's this water gun? - It's not me.

1434
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,600
This isn't anything. Someone's setting me up.

1435
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,640
In my perspective, it's either you or Haha.

1436
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,840
Think carefully.

1437
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,170
If I made this up,

1438
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:53,540
I would choose a smaller one.

1439
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,600
I'm spilling water everywhere.

1440
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,770
Look at this. I wouldn't have chosen this one.

1441
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,070
I'm not that dumb.

1442
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,800
- Seok Jin is out. - What?

1443
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,000
- Seok Jin is out. - What?

1444
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,100
(Why is he out all of a sudden?)

1445
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,870
We were all here.

1446
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:08,000
Out?

1447
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,140
(What is this?)

1448
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:13,570
(Few minutes ago, when everyone was focused on chasing Jae Seok,)

1449
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:17,240
(Detective Seok Jin quietly left the group.)

1450
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,200
You'll be out now.

1451
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:24,300
(His level 2 power is pretending to be out. One false alarm is allowed.)

1452
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,440
I'll disappear in front of your eyes.

1453
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,370
(He used his superpower.)

1454
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,500
No one has done it. He just outed himself.

1455
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:38,070
He's Sherlock. He's trying to do something while faking his death.

1456
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,270
(That's right.)

1457
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:44,600
Anyway, it's not me.

1458
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,640
Kwon Ryeol, why are you pretending to be on their side?

1459
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:50,100
- You have to be where I am. - I'm sorry.

1460
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,400
We're not here for this.

1461
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,470
I told you. I'm not that person.

1462
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:56,900
(He escapes amidst suspicion.)

1463
00:58:57,470 --> 00:58:58,540
Is it you?

1464
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:00,640
(Staring)

1465
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,670
You know that Jong Kook is staring at you, right?

1466
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:04,740
Yes, but I don't know why.

1467
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:06,500
(Chuckling)

1468
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,300
He's staring at you.

1469
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:10,840
I mean...

1470
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,500
I don't know if he's giving me a sign or if he's suspicious of me.

1471
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,000
He is suspicious of you.

1472
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,870
Really?

1473
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,640
It's pretty obvious.

1474
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,540
I think he knows something.

1475
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:24,440
Kwang Soo.

1476
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:28,000
(Do you want to know what he knows?)

1477
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,170
What is this?

1478
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:30,840
You should do something, right?

1479
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,100
Is it me? Wait.

1480
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:34,740
- You can turn back the time. - Not now.

1481
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:35,940
- You'll turn it anyway. - Not now.

1482
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:38,000
- You'll turn it anyway. - Not now. Wait.

1483
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,170
- What is this. - You should do something.

1484
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:42,000
Wait. Is it me?

1485
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,900
(Agent Jae Seok begins his mission.)

1486
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:47,300
- Why me? - Someone has to...

1487
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,500
- Someone has to give himself in. - Wait.

1488
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,240
Wait.

1489
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,500
You can do it after you're out.

1490
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:57,000
(His target is Thor Jong Kook.)

1491
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:00,070
- Okay. - Why me?

1492
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,870
(Thor Jong Kook doesn't have his guard up at the moment.)

1493
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:07,800
(Agent Jae Seok's gun is fully loaded.)

1494
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,070
(He commences.)

1495
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,570
(Can Jong Kook be outed first for the first time in history?)

1496
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:16,370
Wait. The time controller!

1497
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,240
The time controller!

1498
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,970
I'm not supposed to use it like this.

1499
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:24,240
(Agent Jae Seok has succeeded.)

1500
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,840
(Thor Jong Kook is out.)

1501
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,040
He called the time controller.

1502
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:30,000
You shot me after that.

1503
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:31,740
You shot me after that.

1504
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,670
We'll go back to 10 seconds ago.

1505
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:35,070
- What is this? - Oh boy.

1506
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:37,540
Okay, I got it. You're a dead man now.

1507
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,000
This can't be happening.

1508
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,600
This was the perfect timing.

1509
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,170
- You're a dead man now. - Goodness, I'm dead.

1510
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:45,500
This was the perfect timing.

1511
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:47,370
The time controller!

1512
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:54,170
(Time Controller Haha turns time back to 10 seconds ago.)

1513
01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:00,140
You can't do this to me.

1514
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:01,970
What did I do to you?

1515
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:03,470
Five, four,

1516
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:04,940
- We'll talk later. - three,

1517
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,670
- It's over. - two, one.

1518
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:10,040
- Start. - Run!

1519
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:13,800
(They are closing up to the likely suspect, Jae Seok.)

1520
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,570
(It's a door! He heads straight to the emergency exit.)

1521
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,740
What is this?

1522
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,470
(Thor Jong Kook aims for the target.)

1523
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:28,770
(He rips Jae Seok's name tag.)

1524
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:34,040
(However, the main character tag that everyone expected isn't there.)

1525
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,570
We were wrong.

1526
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:38,070
(The main character wasn't Agent Jae Seok.)

1527
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:40,040
Does he have another power?

1528
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:44,270
(I said it wasn't me.)

1529
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:48,500
(Jae Seok is out.)

1530
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,340
(Jae Seok wasn't the main character. They're in an emergency meeting.)

1531
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,700
It looks pitiful.

1532
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,170
(History will remember the good hero under false accusations.)

1533
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,640
It looks like blood, too.

1534
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:03,040
(Meanwhile, if Jae Seok isn't the main character,)

1535
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,000
(it's one of these two.)

1536
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,340
Let's not count the people who have already done Member's Week.

1537
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:12,140
All right. We're safe.

1538
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:17,400
(They're talking out loud on purpose, right?)

1539
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,970
Should we scatter first?

1540
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:22,070
Okay. Let's do that first.

1541
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:23,500
(To isolate the suspects, they part ways.)

1542
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,740
They will plan something if they are together.

1543
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:29,040
We should take all the name tags.

1544
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,470
Let us live.

1545
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:32,770
So it's you.

1546
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,200
If it isn't Jae Seok, it's you.

1547
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:37,600
Tell me the truth.

1548
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,100
- I'd tell you if it were the truth. - The viewers are watching...

1549
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,700
- and blaming you. - It's not me.

1550
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,440
You know, right?

1551
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:44,900
- It's not me. - You know, right?

1552
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:47,800
If we add up all the times that...

1553
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:51,440
I was betrayed by him, I am nothing compared to him.

1554
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,740
Let's take Haha first...

1555
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:56,200
and then Kwang Soo.

1556
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:58,440
You are really good at acting.

1557
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:02,470
You are doing all the acting you should be doing in dramas.

1558
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:04,170
What did you say?

1559
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:07,340
Don't squeeze too hard. I know you are feeling guilty.

1560
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:09,800
You need me if you want to take Jong Kook's name tag.

1561
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:11,670
Trust me.

1562
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:14,500
- What did you say? - Why is he still here?

1563
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,770
You told me we'd cooperate, Haha.

1564
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,500
Let's take Kwang Soo's name tag.

1565
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:20,570
I'm telling you. It isn't me.

1566
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:23,370
I'm not the one. I swear.

1567
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:26,670
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1568
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,800
It isn't me. I promise you.

1569
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,670
It isn't me.

1570
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:32,970
(This is a dilemma.)

1571
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:35,670
Isn't it like this?

1572
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:38,270
What is that?

1573
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,370
- What is that? - They're clones.

1574
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,270
(Clones?)

1575
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:47,270
(All of a sudden, there are unidentified men in the hall.)

1576
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:50,740
(Who are they?)

1577
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,300
Hold on!

1578
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,700
Wait.

1579
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,470
(The unidentified men pounce on Kwang Soo.)

1580
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,400
Wait.

1581
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,040
(Who summoned the clones?)

1582
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,970
Come here. It's not time yet.

1583
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:08,100
What?

1584
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:11,370
What?

1585
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:12,700
Gary?

1586
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,770
(It's Gary?)

1587
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:18,600
- It's not time yet. Come here. - It's Gary?

1588
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,770
- It's Gary? - Isn't it his voice?

1589
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:22,440
- Yes. - Wasn't it Gary?

1590
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,370
(They all panic.)

1591
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:26,400
- What? What's going on? - What's going on?

1592
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,500
(What did I just see?)

1593
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:30,200
That was Gary's voice.

1594
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,070
This is Gary's week.

1595
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:35,640
(Avatar Kwang Soo is pale because he's in shock.)

1596
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:36,800
For real?

1597
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,670
(He doesn't understand what's going on.)

1598
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:44,870
(The four clones appeared out of nowhere.)

1599
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:48,500
(There could only be one person behind it.)

1600
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,040
(It's Gary, the 1st and 2nd winner of Battle of Supernaturals.)

1601
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:56,270
(What happened?)

1602
01:04:57,770 --> 01:05:00,300
(Two hours before filming)

1603
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:05,870
(One man awaits for the beginning of Battle of Supernaturals.)

1604
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:09,600
The invitation came in a rush...

1605
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:12,600
but thank you for having me here.

1606
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:15,240
(Gary is the fourth participant of the Member's Week.)

1607
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:19,600
(He's the man of the Battle of Supernaturals.)

1608
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,870
(Your abilities are useless in the face of his clones.)

1609
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:24,800
(There's no Battle of Supernaturals without him.)

1610
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:28,440
We called you in a hurry to invite you.

1611
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:29,900
Thank you.

1612
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:32,300
It's been a while since I've met them...

1613
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:33,570
but I'll never...

1614
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:35,640
go easy...

1615
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:37,200
or be soft-hearted.

1616
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,270
I will be...

1617
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:40,440
the winner.

1618
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:43,970
(He plays a game to earn his superpower.)

1619
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:49,970
(He earns 4 clones which is the 3rd level of superpower.)

1620
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,340
(Gary is the man of Battle of Supernaturals.)

1621
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:59,300
(He transforms into Ga Wukong.)

1622
01:06:02,370 --> 01:06:04,040
(30 minutes before start of the race)

1623
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,470
They're going to try to eliminate me for certain.

1624
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:10,570
Jong Kook will hold on to two of you.

1625
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,440
Let me go in the middle.

1626
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:17,770
(Gary is back.)

1627
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:20,200
Haha, you wanted to work together.

1628
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,870
(They were being suspicious over whose special this was.)

1629
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,700
(Here comes Ga Wukong.)

1630
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:27,200
Should I eliminate Seok Jin?

1631
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,700
- Who's that? - Go after Kwang Soo.

1632
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:32,700
Hold on.

1633
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:36,040
(The surprise attack shocked everybody.)

1634
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:37,440
Who is it?

1635
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,440
Let go.

1636
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,670
Come back. It's not time yet.

1637
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:43,670
(His first target has gone pale.)

1638
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,240
That's enough.

1639
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,500
You just have to scare them.

1640
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,340
It's Gary. That was his voice.

1641
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,670
(They didn't expect to see Gary.)

1642
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:54,770
(That was Gary for certain.)

1643
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:00,370
(The real battle starts now.)

1644
01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:03,900
- I'm getting goosebumps. - I was shocked.

1645
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:06,540
- That was Gary. - Are they all dead, then?

1646
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:08,670
They're all dead.

1647
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:09,770
(That was totally unexpected.)

1648
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:12,170
His clones are too strong. He has the best superpower.

1649
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:13,540
- That's right. - I thought...

1650
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,240
he quit.

1651
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,440
Why does he keep coming back?

1652
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,500
We start forgetting about him and he comes back.

1653
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,970
How does that work for us?

1654
01:07:21,970 --> 01:07:24,800
(We said our farewells and wished each other the best.)

1655
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,770
We try to move on but he comes back every time.

1656
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:28,740
Ji Hyo has to cry again today.

1657
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,240
I'm sick of this.

1658
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,670
Tell him to just show himself.

1659
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:37,100
We should bring all the Avengers together.

1660
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,240
Jae Seok and...

1661
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:40,600
Time Controller Haha.

1662
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:42,340
Thor Jong Kook.

1663
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,700
The big, blue...

1664
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,400
(He's a blue man in vacation clothing.)

1665
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,570
- I have no power. - Black Widow Ji Hyo.

1666
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,200
We'll protect the Earth.

1667
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,240
We will.

1668
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,240
(We are here to protect the Earth.)

1669
01:07:57,570 --> 01:07:58,670
(Rummaging)

1670
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:00,900
Time Controller.

1671
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:03,470
Blue long hair.

1672
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:06,970
(We'll protect the Earth by ourselves.)

1673
01:08:06,970 --> 01:08:08,700
I don't know how else to introduce myself.

1674
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:10,640
Pervert.

1675
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:13,140
(Call the police to report indecent behaviors.)

1676
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,270
(I want to be something cool.)

1677
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,110
First person should be Haha...

1678
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:20,240
or Jong Kook.

1679
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:23,840
I can eliminate Gary.

1680
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:26,040
- You can? - Yes. Should I?

1681
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,300
- Yes. - Now?

1682
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:28,900
- Can you just do it? - Yes.

1683
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:30,840
- Are you going to use it? - I have my superpower.

1684
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:35,000
(A few hours earlier at the Superpower Exchange Card Room)

1685
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,500
"Stick any member's name tag on yourself to eliminate them."

1686
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,770
(Jong Kook earned an extra name tag.)

1687
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:44,870
(He just needs a copy of Gary's name tag.)

1688
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,400
(Should I do it?)

1689
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,500
Keep going forward.

1690
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,870
(What are those four planning?)

1691
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,940
Somebody's coming.

1692
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,670
- Somebody's coming. - What's the announcement?

1693
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:02,540
Jong Kook is out.

1694
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:04,500
- Jong Kook, you've been eliminated. - What?

1695
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,610
Why?

1696
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:10,500
(Grinning)

1697
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:13,400
(Whose special do you think this is?)

1698
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,700
(He was sure it was Jae Seok.)

1699
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:19,200
(Throughout the race, Jong Kook was questioning Jae Seok.)

1700
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:23,200
(I'm in trouble.)

1701
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,040
I might...

1702
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,140
get eliminated with no chance.

1703
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:36,200
(Jong Kook is Jae Seok's biggest obstacle.)

1704
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:39,940
Okay. Give it to me.

1705
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,400
Give me the Death Note Card.

1706
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:43,900
- Would you like to use it? - Yes.

1707
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:45,870
I'll write his name down just to be safe.

1708
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:50,040
(He wrote Jong Kook's name down so that he can't eliminate him.)

1709
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:55,140
(If I get eliminated, Jong Kook will also be out 10 minutes later.)

1710
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:58,500
(If I get eliminated, Jong Kook will also be out 10 minutes later.)

1711
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:01,370
(He got no chance to negotiate.)

1712
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,970
(Fine. Let's die together.)

1713
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:06,610
(Jae Seok got eliminated without doing anything.)

1714
01:10:06,610 --> 01:10:10,770
(10 minutes has passed.)

1715
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:12,670
Jong Kook is out.

1716
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:16,700
(Jong Kook is out.)

1717
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:19,340
I've thought it over but I have no choice.

1718
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,870
If I get eliminated,

1719
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,770
you're out as well.

1720
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,300
I'm sorry.

1721
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:28,170
(Thor Jong Kook is eliminated because of Jae Seok.)

1722
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,000
I have such a good superpower.

1723
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,140
(He's mad.)

1724
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:35,300
(Did you think I'll let it go?)

1725
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:38,340
- This is too funny. - You should have kept him alive.

1726
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:39,400
- Why? - Jae Seok.

1727
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:41,970
There's Gary.

1728
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:44,300
- What? - It's Gary's special.

1729
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:46,170
- What? - Gary's here.

1730
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:48,540
- Gary's here? - He's here with his clones.

1731
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:50,270
It's Gary's special.

1732
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:52,870
- I told you it wasn't me. - It's your fault.

1733
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:54,700
It's not me, you fool.

1734
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:56,800
I was trying to bring you back alive.

1735
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,900
Forward.

1736
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,570
Stop.

1737
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:03,570
- What's that? - Hurry.

1738
01:11:03,670 --> 01:11:05,400
(Without Jong Kook,)

1739
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,200
(Gary has nothing to be scared of.)

1740
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:12,570
It's Gary. His clones are with him.

1741
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,340
Get Haha. Haha.

1742
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,440
Let's get far away.

1743
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:21,200
He's coming.

1744
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,500
(Just run.)

1745
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Get Haha.

1746
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,700
(Dashing)

1747
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,170
You guys are too fast.

1748
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:34,000
These clones have upgraded.

1749
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:37,040
What if I die, guys?

1750
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,700
What's going on?

1751
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:43,870
(Black Widow Ji Hyo sprints away.)

1752
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:46,700
(Gasping)

1753
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,740
This is insane.

1754
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:52,400
This is insane.

1755
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,670
Is Haha not here?

1756
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,540
He went downstairs?

1757
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:57,970
(Gary and his clones are closing in.)

1758
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,300
Gary... That was unexpected.

1759
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:05,610
That was totally unexpected.

1760
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:07,700
(Gary is the real champion of the Battle of Supernaturals.)

1761
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:10,610
(Would he remain as the ultimate winner?)

1762
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,800
(The members are scattered everywhere.)

1763
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,300
(Frightened)

1764
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:23,540
Fetch Haha. It's Haha.

1765
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:26,440
(The clones are faster and more powerful than before.)

1766
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,770
It's me? Hold on.

1767
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:30,540
Gary. Hey.

1768
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:31,870
(We'll deliver you to him without hurting you.)

1769
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:33,300
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

1770
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:35,500
(He waits for an opportunity to attack.)

1771
01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:38,110
Hey, let's change plans.

1772
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:39,300
Gary.

1773
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,500
(It's a surprise attack.)

1774
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,670
(Bye, Haha.)

1775
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,610
Blinding Card.

1776
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:47,700
(Blinding Card)

1777
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,870
(Gary is blinded for 1 minute.)

1778
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:52,900
What's this?

1779
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:56,500
(He runs away.)

1780
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:58,500
Is he gone?

1781
01:12:58,610 --> 01:13:00,900
(The camera has been filming his back all day.)

1782
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:02,770
How does this work?

1783
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:06,070
What I'm hoping is that Haha...

1784
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:07,270
(They discuss how they'll be revived.)

1785
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:09,800
- He can turn back time. - That's one possible way.

1786
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:12,170
If we get revived,

1787
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:14,970
I'll kill Gary right away.

1788
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:18,070
- That's a good plan. - I'll do it right away.

1789
01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:19,170
We have to avoid the penalty.

1790
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:20,700
There might be something else.

1791
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:23,940
If Gary wins, we'll all be penalized.

1792
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:25,270
Do you have no superpower at all?

1793
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:26,400
I have none.

1794
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:30,070
Haha. Kwang Soo.

1795
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:31,270
Be quiet.

1796
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:34,140
- If we don't work together, - Right.

1797
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:35,640
- Gary will win. - Right.

1798
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,270
He has his clones so there's nothing we can do.

1799
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:39,900
And Gary is still affectionate about you...

1800
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,540
so can you eliminate him?

1801
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:44,300
That's not the problem. He has his clones so I can't even get close.

1802
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:45,500
They'll grab me.

1803
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,000
Why do his clones follow him all the time?

1804
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,300
Come with me and grab on to the clones.

1805
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,500
Okay. Let's go.

1806
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:52,610
Let's go.

1807
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:54,200
Let's go.

1808
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,000
(Am I supposed to come, too?)

1809
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:04,700
(Gary and Ji Hyo haven't met for a while on Mondays.)

1810
01:14:04,870 --> 01:14:06,670
- Since when have you been here? - Are you with them?

1811
01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:08,570
Ji Hyo.

1812
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:10,470
Hold both of his hands.

1813
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:13,140
I can't eliminate her.

1814
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:14,500
(He gets soft-hearted.)

1815
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,540
- Let's shake hands at least. - Sure.

1816
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:18,870
- It's great to see you. - You, too.

1817
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:20,170
(They're happy to see each other.)

1818
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:24,340
- Aren't they happy to see me? - Come on, Gary.

1819
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:26,070
Don't plot something against me.

1820
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:27,670
- Of course not. - Don't say that.

1821
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:29,700
Are you going to turn back the time?

1822
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:31,270
Turn back to when?

1823
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:33,770
To seven years ago.

1824
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:36,070
(Please turn the time to 7 years ago.)

1825
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:38,240
Let's go back to July, seven years ago.

1826
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:39,670
It's good to see you.

1827
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:42,770
- Are you the main member today? - Give me a high five.

1828
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,770
Are you the main member of this week?

1829
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:45,970
- I love you, Gary. - Me?

1830
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:47,370
I'm not sure about that.

1831
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,470
If you aren't, it's one of these two.

1832
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:55,070
(Does Ji Hyo trust Gary and suspect these two?)

1833
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:57,070
(Gary summons Haha.)

1834
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,670
(He orders his clones to capture Haha.)

1835
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:05,670
- I summon Haha. - Wait.

1836
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:06,700
(Kwang Soo runs away.)

1837
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:08,170
Wait a minute. Kwang Soo.

1838
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:11,670
(Ji Hyo starts to attack.)

1839
01:15:11,670 --> 01:15:14,040
- Don't push me. - Hurry up, Ji Hyo.

1840
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:17,270
- Ji Hyo, please. - There you go.

1841
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:19,770
Haha is out.

1842
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:21,470
(Time Controller Haha is eliminated.)

1843
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:22,800
Haha is out.

1844
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,500
(Kwang Soo has the superpower to betray.)

1845
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:28,070
Haha, who eliminated you?

1846
01:15:28,670 --> 01:15:30,240
Gary and the clones.

1847
01:15:30,570 --> 01:15:32,040
Why didn't you eliminate Gary?

1848
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:35,240
- It wasn't possible. - Actually, I'm not out yet.

1849
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:36,970
(Seok Jin is still alive.)

1850
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:42,610
(His superpower was to pretend as if he's eliminated.)

1851
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:46,970
(He's happy to disappear.)

1852
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:52,070
(Detective Seok Jin pretended to be out and waited for his chance.)

1853
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,170
Actually, I'm not out yet.

1854
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:55,610
- Seriously? - Yes.

1855
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:58,040
- Gary doesn't know. - What's going on over there?

1856
01:15:58,070 --> 01:15:59,770
- Is Ji Hyo eliminated? - Eliminate Gary.

1857
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:00,970
Just go.

1858
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:02,970
Okay, I'll go and improvise.

1859
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:06,970
(Everyone's hope, Detective Seok Jin, is back.)

1860
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:11,470
(He's surprised.)

1861
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,900
Kwang Soo, I'll tell you the truth.

1862
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:15,800
I seem eliminated, right?

1863
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,800
- Everyone forgot about you. - I know.

1864
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,770
As soon as he sees me, he'll wonder.

1865
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:23,770
We should team up.

1866
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:26,340
- Gary is too strong. - Isn't he?

1867
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:27,540
Let's go to Ji Hyo.

1868
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:31,140
Gary is coming.

1869
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,500
Get Kwang Soo.

1870
01:16:33,170 --> 01:16:35,800
Hurry, we must catch him this time.

1871
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:39,470
Gary is coming.

1872
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:41,970
We must catch him.

1873
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:44,700
(They run after Kwang Soo.)

1874
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:53,700
(Seok Jin hides behind the door to chase after Gary.)

1875
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:56,900
(He's after Gary.)

1876
01:16:58,170 --> 01:17:01,140
(Gary doesn't notice Seok Jin.)

1877
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:04,770
(What?)

1878
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:06,870
Hey.

1879
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,040
(They stop.)

1880
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:11,140
Clones, hurry and catch him!

1881
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:14,140
Stop it.

1882
01:17:15,610 --> 01:17:16,670
(Tearing)

1883
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:19,170
No way.

1884
01:17:19,570 --> 01:17:21,140
He startled me.

1885
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:23,970
Seok Jin is out.

1886
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:25,610
You surprised me.

1887
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:27,610
This is what I heard when I turned.

1888
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:29,400
(It's the sound of Seok Jin running.)

1889
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,700
It's the sound of your footsteps.

1890
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,700
- It's obvious. - It could have been amazing.

1891
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,500
(Detective Seok Jin tried his best.)

1892
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:36,700
I was so close.

1893
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,900
I definitely heard that you were eliminated.

1894
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:42,300
- Seok Jin is really eliminated. - Is it real this time?

1895
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:45,370
Clones! Clones!

1896
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:47,270
He held my arms!

1897
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:48,770
Gary is out.

1898
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:51,400
I'm out?

1899
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,240
Am I eliminated?

1900
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,070
(How did he get eliminated?)

1901
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,970
(This is what happened during the superpower exchange.)

1902
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:01,700
Death Note Card?

1903
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:05,870
(Ji Hyo obtained the Death Note Card like Agent Jae Seok.)

1904
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:08,570
(She wrote on it beforehand to defend herself.)

1905
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:14,170
(Whoever holds both of her arms will be eliminated.)

1906
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:16,900
(Whoever holds both of her arms will be eliminated.)

1907
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:20,270
(Gary was happy after eliminating Seok Jin.)

1908
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:21,700
- Gary. - Seok Jin.

1909
01:18:21,870 --> 01:18:23,270
You startled me.

1910
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:27,770
(Black Widow Ji Hyo hid behind and waited for her chance.)

1911
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:31,670
(It was when Gary was relieved.)

1912
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:35,670
(She gave both of her arms while pretending to attack him.)

1913
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:36,800
(He's flustered.)

1914
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,470
(Gary holds both of her arms.)

1915
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:43,270
The person to hold both of my arms is eliminated.

1916
01:18:43,610 --> 01:18:44,770
Am I really eliminated?

1917
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:49,440
Right?

1918
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:52,500
(Today's main member, Gary, is eliminated.)

1919
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:55,470
(The other members are exempted from punishment.)

1920
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:56,570
Ji Hyo.

1921
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:58,340
You must win.

1922
01:18:58,470 --> 01:19:01,300
Kwang Soo still remains.

1923
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,370
I can't help you.

1924
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:05,770
I completely failed.

1925
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:06,900
(He fails.)

1926
01:19:06,970 --> 01:19:08,610
I couldn't defeat Ji Hyo.

1927
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:11,770
(It's too difficult to defeat Ji Hyo.)

1928
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,470
What do I do?

1929
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:22,070
(It's a match between Avatar Kwang Soo and Black Widow Ji Hyo.)

1930
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:25,540
I can't eliminate him because he's too strong.

1931
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:29,610
(He's too strong to defeat. Is the strategy the only answer?)

1932
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:32,800
(Tall and blue Kwang Soo appears.)

1933
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:35,670
There he is.

1934
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:37,240
(She hides to attack him from behind.)

1935
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:42,300
(Kwang Soo is within her radar.)

1936
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:44,870
Go away. Don't film me.

1937
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:47,240
(He stops filming.)

1938
01:19:47,970 --> 01:19:52,440
(Avatar Kwang Soo slowly approaches Ji Hyo.)

1939
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:55,670
(She's fully alert.)

1940
01:19:56,240 --> 01:20:00,440
(Ji Hyo is only 10m away from Kwang Soo.)

1941
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:02,300
(She runs up quickly.)

1942
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,670
(She approaches him.)

1943
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:09,800
(Black Widow Ji Hyo silently follows Kwang Soo from behind.)

1944
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:13,570
(She just needs to remove his name tag.)

1945
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:15,070
(Now is the time.)

1946
01:20:15,070 --> 01:20:16,170
(Tearing)

1947
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:18,470
(She takes off his name tag.)

1948
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:20,800
(She stops.)

1949
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:23,370
I knew you would do that.

1950
01:20:23,370 --> 01:20:26,300
(Ji Hyo isn't happy, and Kwang Soo is smiling.)

1951
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:28,770
(Something is written under Kwang Soo's name tag.)

1952
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:32,370
(He has a Reflecting Card.)

1953
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:36,170
(Kwang Soo chose a gold box.)

1954
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:40,070
(Luckily, he got a Reflecting Card.)

1955
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,500
I'm blue with long hair.

1956
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:45,170
(He relieves everyone by acting foolishly.)

1957
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:47,240
Only you and Ji Hyo remain.

1958
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:51,400
(That means...)

1959
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:54,900
(it's time to use the hidden card.)

1960
01:20:55,540 --> 01:21:01,400
(While Ji Hyo is hiding, Kwang Soo spots her.)

1961
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,140
(He smiles a little.)

1962
01:21:04,370 --> 01:21:09,670
(He turns back and exposes his name tag.)

1963
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:16,270
(Black Widow Ji Hyo falls for Kwang Soo's acting.)

1964
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:19,170
(Goodbye, Ji Hyo.)

1965
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:22,670
(He shouts joyfully.)

1966
01:21:22,970 --> 01:21:25,610
With his Reflecting Card, Ji Hyo is out.

1967
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:26,900
(Black Widow Ji Hyo is out.)

1968
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:28,670
Why did I even believe you?

1969
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:29,870
(She's completely fooled.)

1970
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:31,170
(He unbuttons himself.)

1971
01:21:33,070 --> 01:21:36,440
(He shows off his blue muscles.)

1972
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:40,570
(The winner of Ultimate Battle of Supernaturals is Avatar Kwang Soo.)

1973
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:44,340
He let her rip his name tag on purpose.

1974
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:46,610
I didn't expect Gary to appear.

1975
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:48,070
I had no idea, either.

1976
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:50,870
I follow Gary on social media.

1977
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:53,070
- He's been in China. - Right.

1978
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:56,040
- I posted more photos on purpose... - Really?

1979
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,170
after receiving the invitation.

1980
01:21:57,670 --> 01:21:59,170
- He was in China. - I was surprised.

1981
01:21:59,170 --> 01:22:01,900
- My appearance was perfect. - You stayed in China for long.

1982
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,670
How you showed up was perfect.

1983
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:05,610
- I was so surprised. - I had no idea.

1984
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:06,900
I was very surprised.

1985
01:22:06,970 --> 01:22:08,770
Why don't you come back?

1986
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,270
- Just come back. - Come on, Gary.

1987
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:13,270
- I'll return once in a while... - You should.

1988
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:14,970
after I travel abroad.

1989
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:17,770
Today's winner is Avatar Kwang Soo.

1990
01:22:17,770 --> 01:22:19,610
(Avatar Kwang Soo wins.)

1991
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:20,900
That was impressive.

1992
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,870
- The trophy looks better. - It's all gold.

1993
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,070
We're together again after a long time.

1994
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,340
We're together again.

1995
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:29,970
I still have the pen at my studio.

1996
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:32,500
(The members can't let go of Gary, and he can't leave.)

1997
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:35,440
Gary joined us for Lunar New Year.

1998
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,700
It was a pleasant surprise.

1999
01:22:37,770 --> 01:22:39,300
The Running Man family is together.

2000
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:43,470
I'm happy that all seven of us can wish Happy New Year to the viewers.

2001
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:46,570
- Everyone, Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

2002
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:51,240
(We'll work hard again this year. Everyone, Happy New Year.)

2003
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:53,270
This is Running Man, Member's Week.

2004
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:56,340
(It's the 5th main member.)

2005
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:58,870
(Haha)

2006
01:22:58,970 --> 01:23:00,900
Haha!

2007
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:02,170
It's because I trust you.

2008
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:06,470
(Haha can't decide while the members are at risk.)

2009
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:07,570
I'm about to lose my mind.

2010
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:09,670
Haha, please save me.

2011
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:12,870
(The members' fates depend on Haha.)

2012
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:17,870
(It's the moment of decision. Haha must choose only one.)

2013
01:23:17,870 --> 01:23:19,870
(Whom will he choose to save?)

2014
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:21,870
(The Fifth Member's Week, Haha's Choice)
