00:00:07,761 --> 00:00:11,791
(The 5th Member's Week, "What Is Wrong with Him?")

2
00:00:15,942 --> 00:00:20,272
I am Kim Sang Joong Ha from What Is Wrong with Him?

3
00:00:21,472 --> 00:00:25,312
It's been five weeks since the Member's Week had started.

4
00:00:25,412 --> 00:00:29,442
This week's host is Running Man's child,

5
00:00:29,808 --> 00:00:32,538
Haha.

6
00:00:33,372 --> 00:00:35,742
(Haha's office in Hapjeong-dong)

7
00:00:35,742 --> 00:00:39,012
The host of this week's episode is you, Haha.

8
00:00:39,012 --> 00:00:42,182
If there's anything you wanted or wished to do,

9
00:00:42,672 --> 00:00:44,442
please tell us honestly.

10
00:00:45,642 --> 00:00:50,312
(Haha, the host of the 5th Member's Week)

11
00:00:50,312 --> 00:00:53,442
What shall I do? What do I do?

12
00:00:53,442 --> 00:00:55,412
Should we play basketball?

13
00:00:56,412 --> 00:01:01,042
Or should we play baseball? I don't think we should do sports.

14
00:01:02,142 --> 00:01:05,672
Should we do something with music?

15
00:01:05,842 --> 00:01:08,212
But I'm not confident in music.

16
00:01:08,742 --> 00:01:10,412
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

17
00:01:10,812 --> 00:01:12,142
Or should I bully the members?

18
00:01:12,142 --> 00:01:15,442
How about going to Dokdo? We can build a ship and go.

19
00:01:15,672 --> 00:01:16,942
Shall we do a live show?

20
00:01:16,942 --> 00:01:19,212
Should we do something that offers prize money?

21
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,642
Or we can just fight?

22
00:01:21,642 --> 00:01:23,912
There are so many things I would like to try,

23
00:01:23,912 --> 00:01:26,772
but I can't include all that in one episode. It's so hard.

24
00:01:28,472 --> 00:01:29,512
What am I going to do?

25
00:01:29,512 --> 00:01:31,912
(The 5th Member's Week hits a wall.)

26
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:37,242
But you see,

27
00:01:37,272 --> 00:01:39,972
during the interview with Haha,

28
00:01:40,212 --> 00:01:45,442
we were able to discover something strange about him.

29
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:48,642
Do I look bad? Should I put on some makeup?

30
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,042
Should I put on a mask or not?

31
00:01:51,642 --> 00:01:53,042
It's cold, right?

32
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:54,672
Shall I drink hot coffee?

33
00:01:55,412 --> 00:01:56,912
This is iced coffee.

34
00:01:57,342 --> 00:02:00,242
As I think about it, I want to do a lot of things.

35
00:02:00,242 --> 00:02:02,372
I don't know what I should do.

36
00:02:02,742 --> 00:02:04,242
I'm going crazy.

37
00:02:06,172 --> 00:02:07,312
What should I do?

38
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:10,942
(Laughing)

39
00:02:10,942 --> 00:02:12,282
(Here he goes again.)

40
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:14,112
(Screaming)

41
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:15,372
My head hurts!

42
00:02:17,942 --> 00:02:21,012
It seems like Haha has a difficult time...

43
00:02:21,012 --> 00:02:24,412
when he has to decide on something.

44
00:02:24,642 --> 00:02:26,412
But you see,

45
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:30,072
why can't he decide on his own?

46
00:02:30,642 --> 00:02:35,372
We should meet his acquaintances to see if he struggles...

47
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:38,642
to decide on something in his daily life.

48
00:02:39,342 --> 00:02:42,472
I think he contemplates a lot...

49
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:44,282
even when he eats.

50
00:02:44,282 --> 00:02:47,642
He has a hard time choosing which one to buy. He can't decide.

51
00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:49,942
It takes a long time for him to decide.

52
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:51,412
He asks me...

53
00:02:51,412 --> 00:02:53,642
what he should do. He asks me this quite a lot.

54
00:02:53,642 --> 00:02:57,172
I find that side of him very irritating.

55
00:02:57,372 --> 00:02:59,172
When I gave him his outfit and even though...

56
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:01,842
the socks were the same design, he contemplated between two pairs.

57
00:03:01,842 --> 00:03:04,042
He said that one of the pairs looked more loose than the other one.

58
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:06,672
So I ended up helping him choose.

59
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:08,272
In that sense, it's a bit frustrating.

60
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,912
He irritates me a lot.

61
00:03:09,912 --> 00:03:11,672
He should make his decisions quickly.

62
00:03:13,312 --> 00:03:14,572
According to the interviews,

63
00:03:14,572 --> 00:03:18,372
his inability to decide seems to be more serious than we thought.

64
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:21,542
In order to help him,

65
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:25,912
we decided to put him under extreme situations to decide.

66
00:03:26,642 --> 00:03:30,042
We had to face the result...

67
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:32,372
of his profound decisions.

68
00:03:32,372 --> 00:03:33,412
(The result of Haha's decision)

69
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:35,942
Why don't we look at these...

70
00:03:36,672 --> 00:03:37,942
thrilling situations together?

71
00:03:39,672 --> 00:03:41,372
(The whole world has turned into a snow-white, winter palace.)

72
00:03:41,372 --> 00:03:43,942
- This week is Haha's week. - Haha's the host.

73
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:44,942
(What will the members face here?)

74
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:47,972
The host of the fifth Member's Week...

75
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:49,942
is Haha.

76
00:03:50,872 --> 00:03:53,042
- Right. - What will he do?

77
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:55,172
- He will do something childish. - Right? I think so, too.

78
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:57,372
- I thought last week was his week. - So did I.

79
00:03:57,372 --> 00:03:58,912
- Right. - I didn't imagine it'd be Gary's.

80
00:03:58,912 --> 00:04:02,542
This episode is for Haha who is always at a crossroad...

81
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,442
between two important choices and struggles to decide.

82
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:07,512
- You're right. - He thinks too much.

83
00:04:07,512 --> 00:04:08,812
- He can't decide at all. - I agree.

84
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:10,372
He seriously struggles to decide.

85
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:12,742
So we have prepared a race named,

86
00:04:12,742 --> 00:04:14,742
I've Made My Decision.

87
00:04:14,742 --> 00:04:15,812
What is that?

88
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:18,412
- What? - Are we being taken again?

89
00:04:18,412 --> 00:04:20,112
- This is happening again? - We're being dragged again?

90
00:04:20,112 --> 00:04:21,942
(Please come with us.)

91
00:04:21,942 --> 00:04:24,042
- Stop this. - They're getting tired of it, too.

92
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:27,542
- What are you doing? - This is driving me crazy.

93
00:04:28,512 --> 00:04:29,842
Why do you always do this?

94
00:04:29,842 --> 00:04:32,012
The blindfolds are always changing every week though.

95
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:34,012
(To where are they forcefully being taken?)

96
00:04:34,012 --> 00:04:35,542
Why is this blindfold so tight?

97
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,542
I can't see anything.

98
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,312
(How will this place be relevant to Haha?)

99
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,212
Where are we going?

100
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:41,442
(What are you up to, Haha?)

101
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:43,872
I think Haha will do something hard.

102
00:04:44,472 --> 00:04:45,472
(They arrive.)

103
00:04:45,472 --> 00:04:48,082
We've already arrived? What is this?

104
00:04:48,772 --> 00:04:51,772
- What is that crane-looking object? - Wait.

105
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:52,912
What is it?

106
00:04:53,912 --> 00:04:54,942
What is that?

107
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:57,542
(What is the view unfolded before the members' eyes?)

108
00:04:57,542 --> 00:05:00,582
- What? It's for bungee jumping. - Isn't this bungee jumping?

109
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,012
Hey!

110
00:05:02,012 --> 00:05:03,642
(Welcome to a high-altitude drop point.)

111
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:06,672
Haha's gone mad.

112
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:07,942
(We will provide you with fresh, wintry air.)

113
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:10,672
(This will introduce you to a luxurious sky view.)

114
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:12,812
Are we going to bungee jump in this cold wind?

115
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,412
(This 63m tall, bungee jumping platform is the highest in Korea.)

116
00:05:16,412 --> 00:05:17,542
What is this?

117
00:05:17,812 --> 00:05:20,242
- We won't bungee jump, right? - No way.

118
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:23,472
- This isn't possible. - What on earth is this?

119
00:05:23,472 --> 00:05:24,842
(Please enter quickly.)

120
00:05:24,842 --> 00:05:27,012
- No way. This can't be right. - What's wrong with him?

121
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:28,212
(He doesn't mean we should jump here, right?)

122
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:31,542
- It's bungee jumping. Haha's mad. - It's bungee jumping.

123
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:33,442
- Hey! - Jae Seok. It's for bungee jumping.

124
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:35,912
(He has already lost his senses.)

125
00:05:35,912 --> 00:05:37,412
- Wait. Jae Seok! - Hey.

126
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:38,842
I can't do this.

127
00:05:38,842 --> 00:05:39,842
(I want to go home.)

128
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:42,242
How can we do bungee jumping in the midst of winter?

129
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,342
(The elevator welcomes them.)

130
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:45,742
(You've come in one piece, but I won't let that happen when you go.)

131
00:05:45,742 --> 00:05:48,042
This isn't acceptable. He really must be out of his mind.

132
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:49,042
This can't be happening.

133
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:51,772
- It's too cold to bungee jump. - I can't do this.

134
00:05:51,942 --> 00:05:54,272
- We can't do this. - He must have lost his senses.

135
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:55,372
(Haha, what are you up to?)

136
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:57,012
Why are we going there?

137
00:05:57,012 --> 00:05:59,312
(They are unable to ask or discuss. They are forced to get on.)

138
00:06:00,512 --> 00:06:02,212
Should I sit here?

139
00:06:02,212 --> 00:06:03,742
My gosh.

140
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:06,112
I'm going insane.

141
00:06:06,812 --> 00:06:09,412
(He hasn't even gone up, but he's already feeling dizzy.)

142
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:11,542
Gosh, this is total insanity.

143
00:06:11,742 --> 00:06:13,112
I mean...

144
00:06:13,742 --> 00:06:15,942
I really hate high places.

145
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,042
(I'm only sitting down, but it's enough to make me cry.)

146
00:06:18,972 --> 00:06:21,172
(Here comes the customers.)

147
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,642
Do we really have to go up? It's quite high.

148
00:06:27,912 --> 00:06:30,212
(Let's meet again alive.)

149
00:06:30,842 --> 00:06:31,842
- It's going up. - My gosh.

150
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:33,542
(Goodness)

151
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:34,812
Stop it.

152
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:36,542
Don't go up too high.

153
00:06:37,012 --> 00:06:39,542
(The lift is about to break through the atmosphere.)

154
00:06:40,172 --> 00:06:41,572
I'm about to lose it.

155
00:06:41,572 --> 00:06:43,012
(Why do I have to undergo this hardship?)

156
00:06:44,372 --> 00:06:47,272
(Haha, what have we done so wrong to deserve this?)

157
00:06:47,272 --> 00:06:49,012
This is really scary. Let's stop here.

158
00:06:49,212 --> 00:06:51,742
My whole body is going numb.

159
00:06:51,742 --> 00:06:53,442
(Jae Seok and Jong Kook are 40m above the ground.)

160
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:55,572
Stop going up. It's seriously scaring me.

161
00:06:55,572 --> 00:06:57,672
It's really windy.

162
00:06:57,672 --> 00:06:58,672
(The wind is teasing this coward.)

163
00:06:58,842 --> 00:07:01,012
(I can't get up since it's too frightening.)

164
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:02,742
I'm not kidding here. I'm serious.

165
00:07:02,842 --> 00:07:04,672
I can't look outside.

166
00:07:05,012 --> 00:07:07,042
Stop it please.

167
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:11,042
(What is their fate as they dangle from the atmosphere?)

168
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:14,942
How can we go bungee jumping in this cold weather? Come on.

169
00:07:15,472 --> 00:07:16,642
What is this?

170
00:07:17,342 --> 00:07:19,642
(What is it that Kwang Soo and Seok Jin will face?)

171
00:07:19,642 --> 00:07:21,342
I can't do this.

172
00:07:21,342 --> 00:07:23,672
I can't handle this.

173
00:07:23,672 --> 00:07:25,672
I won't do it. I'm going to the bathroom.

174
00:07:26,272 --> 00:07:28,172
- Where is Haha? - Wait.

175
00:07:28,172 --> 00:07:30,442
(We will boycott this episode as a whole.)

176
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:34,012
(What's causing them to make a fuss already?)

177
00:07:34,012 --> 00:07:35,942
- Are you serious? - I really can't do this.

178
00:07:36,912 --> 00:07:38,112
I won't be able to handle this.

179
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:40,142
(It's a slingshot ride. It's a new kind of fearless ride.)

180
00:07:40,772 --> 00:07:42,142
(With one shot, it'll send you to another universe.)

181
00:07:42,142 --> 00:07:43,572
What is this? What's happening?

182
00:07:43,572 --> 00:07:44,642
(Welcome to 50m above the ground.)

183
00:07:44,642 --> 00:07:47,312
- Are we doing this right away? - Hey! Be quiet!

184
00:07:47,312 --> 00:07:49,572
My gosh. Come on.

185
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:51,542
Look, they installed cameras. They are planning to film this.

186
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,172
(The moment you depart is precious.)

187
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,412
- Come on. - Hold on.

188
00:07:55,412 --> 00:07:56,872
I won't get on it.

189
00:07:57,112 --> 00:07:59,812
(Run for your life.)

190
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,112
(There's a fugitive who refuses to get on the ride.)

191
00:08:04,912 --> 00:08:08,272
(The mission to capture Kwang Soo has been put into action.)

192
00:08:09,142 --> 00:08:10,942
(Running)

193
00:08:10,942 --> 00:08:12,012
Hey!

194
00:08:12,012 --> 00:08:14,812
(Since you've stepped on the premises, you can't leave.)

195
00:08:14,812 --> 00:08:16,242
My gosh.

196
00:08:16,742 --> 00:08:18,172
(I caught you, Kwang Soo.)

197
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:20,112
- I seriously can't handle this. - Let me go.

198
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,272
Let go of me!

199
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:24,612
Come out, Haha.

200
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:26,912
Please report them to the police!

201
00:08:27,412 --> 00:08:29,542
(I am innocent.)

202
00:08:29,812 --> 00:08:31,112
This is driving me crazy.

203
00:08:31,272 --> 00:08:32,312
Let go!

204
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:33,342
(How is 50m possible?)

205
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:35,012
(I want to go home.)

206
00:08:36,312 --> 00:08:37,372
Let me go!

207
00:08:37,372 --> 00:08:38,642
(What are you giving me this hardship?)

208
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:40,572
Can I take it off?

209
00:08:40,572 --> 00:08:42,942
(What is it that awaits Ji Hyo?)

210
00:08:44,572 --> 00:08:45,812
What is that?

211
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:47,472
Is that a snake?

212
00:08:47,472 --> 00:08:49,642
(What is that bizarre creature?)

213
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:51,412
(It's an ominous feeling.)

214
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:52,472
What is this?

215
00:08:53,072 --> 00:08:54,472
What is that?

216
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:55,812
(She's shocked.)

217
00:08:56,572 --> 00:08:57,572
(Flinching)

218
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:01,342
I hate this so much!

219
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:04,272
(What is the mysterious creature that's put in front of her eyes?)

220
00:09:04,272 --> 00:09:07,012
(Welcome. Would you like to touch me?)

221
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:10,642
Please, I can't do things like this.

222
00:09:11,682 --> 00:09:14,472
(Ji Hyo's Achilles' heel is anything involving insects.)

223
00:09:14,472 --> 00:09:17,372
Has Haha lost his mind?

224
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:22,112
What's going on? I hate it.

225
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:23,742
It's so annoying.

226
00:09:24,712 --> 00:09:26,772
(Ji Hyo, who hates bugs, is trapped by insects.)

227
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:28,682
I want to go home.

228
00:09:29,272 --> 00:09:31,712
(The worst possible scenarios are about to happen.)

229
00:09:31,712 --> 00:09:34,612
(What will happen to the members?)

230
00:09:34,612 --> 00:09:36,442
(Haha, please save me.)

231
00:09:37,372 --> 00:09:39,842
Hello, where are the other members?

232
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:44,212
The main member of the fifth Member's Week is you.

233
00:09:44,212 --> 00:09:46,412
Please take a look at this.

234
00:09:47,942 --> 00:09:51,712
(Haha receives a mysterious mobile phone.)

235
00:09:51,712 --> 00:09:57,412
(What could be inside the phone?)

236
00:09:58,712 --> 00:10:00,772
- Haha! - What's going on with Seok Jin?

237
00:10:00,772 --> 00:10:03,142
- What's going on? - Seriously.

238
00:10:03,682 --> 00:10:06,612
(He hears Seok Jin's desperate voice.)

239
00:10:06,742 --> 00:10:07,972
What's going on?

240
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:09,712
What is this?

241
00:10:10,112 --> 00:10:12,312
- Haha! - What's going on with Seok Jin?

242
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:15,712
You know me. I'm in a desperate situation.

243
00:10:15,712 --> 00:10:17,812
Haha, I can't get on this ride.

244
00:10:17,812 --> 00:10:20,242
- Please, I beg you. - What is it?

245
00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:22,682
I'm like your brother.

246
00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:25,542
Please, I consider you as my older brother.

247
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:26,842
What's going on?

248
00:10:27,412 --> 00:10:28,682
What is this?

249
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:30,512
- Haha. - It's Kwang Soo.

250
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:34,342
- I wonder why he's making a fuss. - I can't ride it!

251
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,812
I'm staying calm because I trust you.

252
00:10:36,812 --> 00:10:39,542
I wasn't going to say this,

253
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:42,372
but Seok Jin has said bad things about your family.

254
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:44,182
- What? - When we aren't filming,

255
00:10:44,182 --> 00:10:47,042
- I'll tell you later. - Okay.

256
00:10:47,142 --> 00:10:48,142
It's Jae Seok.

257
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,972
I don't know what's going on,

258
00:10:50,972 --> 00:10:54,742
- but I can't bungee jump... - Jae Seok...

259
00:10:54,872 --> 00:10:56,642
in the middle of winter.

260
00:10:56,642 --> 00:10:58,612
- He really hates it. - Please, Haha.

261
00:10:58,772 --> 00:11:02,072
- Please save me, Haha! - How can I save him?

262
00:11:02,072 --> 00:11:03,842
What's going on?

263
00:11:04,312 --> 00:11:07,172
Haha, you know me.

264
00:11:07,512 --> 00:11:09,442
I hate it more than bungee jumping.

265
00:11:09,972 --> 00:11:11,842
- What? - Please save me.

266
00:11:11,842 --> 00:11:14,642
He has to eat ramyeon and cake.

267
00:11:14,642 --> 00:11:16,472
- Haha. - What's wrong?

268
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:18,142
- It's terrible. - What's wrong, Ji Hyo?

269
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:21,972
There are so many centipedes...

270
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,112
that are about this big.

271
00:11:24,112 --> 00:11:27,412
- Please save me. I beg you. - Ji Hyo.

272
00:11:27,742 --> 00:11:31,142
- Please do me a favor. - What's wrong?

273
00:11:31,142 --> 00:11:33,372
She's about to cry.

274
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:35,672
What on earth is going on?

275
00:11:35,742 --> 00:11:37,842
As you always have a difficult time making...

276
00:11:37,842 --> 00:11:41,172
important decisions, we prepared this for you.

277
00:11:41,472 --> 00:11:44,472
Here's the race that the production team prepared.

278
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:48,612
It's called Haha's Choice, I've Made My Decision.

279
00:11:48,612 --> 00:11:50,372
(I've Made My Decision?)

280
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:54,172
What happens to the members depends on you.

281
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:57,872
As time passes, the members will suffer more.

282
00:11:57,912 --> 00:12:01,172
You must decide the order of whom you will save.

283
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:05,712
This morning, I couldn't decide between hot and iced coffee.

284
00:12:05,712 --> 00:12:07,312
In the end, I drank Job's tears tea.

285
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:09,672
I almost lost my mind this morning.

286
00:12:10,142 --> 00:12:11,942
I've made my decision.

287
00:12:12,242 --> 00:12:14,672
My goodness, this is too hard.

288
00:12:14,672 --> 00:12:17,442
Usually, I like to...

289
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:19,772
follow the majority rule.

290
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:22,942
I'm a pacifist so I like peace.

291
00:12:23,172 --> 00:12:26,412
One of the hardest things is...

292
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,612
having to choose a dish when there's a lot on the menu.

293
00:12:29,612 --> 00:12:33,972
I get a panic attack when I have to choose an ice cream flavor.

294
00:12:33,972 --> 00:12:36,072
I should have come up with an idea.

295
00:12:36,072 --> 00:12:39,212
I hate having to make decisions.

296
00:12:39,312 --> 00:12:41,012
(It's almost time to decide.)

297
00:12:41,372 --> 00:12:44,472
(Will he save Jae Seok or Jong Kook?)

298
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,342
He has to make a good decision.

299
00:12:46,912 --> 00:12:48,772
I have to make a decision.

300
00:12:50,142 --> 00:12:51,812
Please call the police.

301
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,472
This is driving me crazy.

302
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,112
(Will it be Seok Jin or Kwang Soo?)

303
00:12:56,372 --> 00:12:59,572
(Or will it be Ji Hyo who's afraid of insects?)

304
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,112
Oh, my goodness.

305
00:13:01,242 --> 00:13:02,772
I can't decide.

306
00:13:02,772 --> 00:13:04,572
(Whom will he choose? That's the question.)

307
00:13:04,572 --> 00:13:06,672
Gosh, what is that?

308
00:13:06,672 --> 00:13:08,442
(Haha arrives at Decision World.)

309
00:13:08,442 --> 00:13:11,842
(His decision will determine the others' fates.)

310
00:13:11,842 --> 00:13:13,772
My goodness.

311
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:18,672
What is that? Is that for bungee jumping?

312
00:13:18,712 --> 00:13:20,972
That's just crazy.

313
00:13:21,312 --> 00:13:24,042
Why are the members placed in such extreme situations?

314
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:26,742
How can anyone jump from there?

315
00:13:26,742 --> 00:13:28,642
It's impossible.

316
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,472
How is this possible?

317
00:13:30,472 --> 00:13:32,012
(How will he decide their fates?)

318
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:35,312
(What happens to those at 63m above ground depends on Haha.)

319
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:36,812
Jae Seok!

320
00:13:36,842 --> 00:13:37,972
Jong Kook!

321
00:13:38,112 --> 00:13:40,742
What? Was that Haha's voice?

322
00:13:40,842 --> 00:13:43,072
Hey, Jong Kook.

323
00:13:43,112 --> 00:13:44,812
- Haha! - What's happening?

324
00:13:45,372 --> 00:13:47,642
(Haha's voice from below comforts them.)

325
00:13:47,642 --> 00:13:48,712
- Jae Seok. - Haha.

326
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:50,572
- I didn't know what was going on. - Haha is here.

327
00:13:50,572 --> 00:13:52,242
- Haha. - Please save me.

328
00:13:52,412 --> 00:13:53,542
Please save me.

329
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:57,012
- Please save me. - What's going on?

330
00:13:57,142 --> 00:13:58,472
Save me.

331
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:01,072
Haha, please save me.

332
00:14:01,272 --> 00:14:02,672
- Gosh. - Haha.

333
00:14:02,912 --> 00:14:05,112
- If they fall off, - Please.

334
00:14:05,242 --> 00:14:07,542
They'll fall in the water.

335
00:14:07,742 --> 00:14:09,172
I'm so scared!

336
00:14:09,712 --> 00:14:11,542
What do I do?

337
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:13,712
Here's your first decision to make.

338
00:14:14,372 --> 00:14:16,772
Starting now,

339
00:14:17,142 --> 00:14:20,342
within five minutes, you must decide...

340
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:22,612
one member to save.

341
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:25,512
(Decide only 1 between 2 members?)

342
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:31,612
The member who isn't chosen will be punished immediately.

343
00:14:31,812 --> 00:14:33,042
- Gosh. - Why?

344
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:36,142
- Jae Seok is afraid of heights. - Haha.

345
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:38,512
- Please save me. - If he isn't chosen,

346
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:41,272
he'll jump off from 63m above ground.

347
00:14:41,642 --> 00:14:43,012
My goodness.

348
00:14:43,672 --> 00:14:46,072
- Haha. - Healthy Jong Kook...

349
00:14:46,272 --> 00:14:47,812
- It's over 10,000 calories. - will eat...

350
00:14:47,972 --> 00:14:49,912
high-calorie foods before coming down.

351
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:52,172
If I eat all of it, I'll die today.

352
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,712
If you exceed the time limit,

353
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:57,742
both members will be punished.

354
00:14:57,842 --> 00:15:01,112
- Please decide within five minutes. - Let me come down!

355
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:05,412
How can I decide?

356
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:10,612
(Whom will Haha choose?)

357
00:15:10,612 --> 00:15:11,672
Jong Kook!

358
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:14,672
- What? - It's just high-calorie foods!

359
00:15:14,672 --> 00:15:16,372
- How can I eat all this? - Jong Kook.

360
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:18,912
- I have to eat all of it. - I thought you had to bungee jump.

361
00:15:18,912 --> 00:15:21,672
- I have to eat all the food. - Come on.

362
00:15:21,742 --> 00:15:24,072
- Jong Kook, that's nothing. - I have to eat them all.

363
00:15:24,072 --> 00:15:25,442
All you have to do is eat.

364
00:15:26,412 --> 00:15:28,012
- My goodness. - All you have to do is jump.

365
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:29,072
What did you say?

366
00:15:29,072 --> 00:15:32,012
- The jump won't take long. - It's the middle of winter.

367
00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:33,872
- All you have to do is jump. - Gosh.

368
00:15:33,872 --> 00:15:36,842
- This will stay in my body. - Just eat and use the toilet.

369
00:15:36,842 --> 00:15:39,472
- I have to exercise a lot. - Haha!

370
00:15:40,242 --> 00:15:42,472
- What are they saying? - Yours is much easier.

371
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:43,542
- Jae Seok! - I'm serious.

372
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,672
What?

373
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,872
How do you feel today?

374
00:15:47,142 --> 00:15:48,842
I feel terrible!

375
00:15:48,842 --> 00:15:50,512
Jae Seok is in his best condition!

376
00:15:50,512 --> 00:15:52,512
- Are you feeling well? - I feel terrible.

377
00:15:52,512 --> 00:15:55,412
He wants to bungee jump for the first time.

378
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,472
Haha.

379
00:15:56,542 --> 00:16:00,412
Jong Kook will have a fit if he eats all the food.

380
00:16:00,472 --> 00:16:03,512
If he gets angry, I'll get beaten up instead!

381
00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:06,112
I had a big breakfast this morning.

382
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:09,072
I can't eat all of this. It's too hard.

383
00:16:09,742 --> 00:16:11,812
(Haha can't decide.)

384
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:14,312
My goodness, what should I do?

385
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:17,912
I think the ramyeon is over 10,000 calories!

386
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:20,042
Can you believe what Jong Kook is saying?

387
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,572
- Do you love me? - It's perfect for bungee jumping.

388
00:16:22,572 --> 00:16:24,572
- Haha. - I said, do you love me?

389
00:16:24,672 --> 00:16:26,212
I love you, Haha.

390
00:16:26,442 --> 00:16:27,812
Make the decision now.

391
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:30,372
- Haha. - I can't decide.

392
00:16:30,642 --> 00:16:33,412
Do you want to see me dead?

393
00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:36,142
All you have to do is jump.

394
00:16:36,142 --> 00:16:37,842
It's over after you jump.

395
00:16:37,842 --> 00:16:40,772
How could you even say that?

396
00:16:40,842 --> 00:16:43,012
- Just jump. - Bungee jumping is scary.

397
00:16:43,012 --> 00:16:45,312
Jump and enjoy the cool weather.

398
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,872
Jong Kook, you can eat that.

399
00:16:47,872 --> 00:16:49,112
No, I can't!

400
00:16:49,612 --> 00:16:51,312
I have to eat all of it.

401
00:16:51,672 --> 00:16:54,072
It's ramyeon and pizza.

402
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:57,512
Gosh, I know how much he hates it.

403
00:16:57,542 --> 00:17:02,872
(To Jong Kook, fast food is the worst food in the world.)

404
00:17:03,012 --> 00:17:05,642
Do you know how much oil is added to jjajangmyeon?

405
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:11,772
(Despite what others said, he was determined to stay healthy.)

406
00:17:11,772 --> 00:17:14,712
- I know how much he hates it. - There are chips.

407
00:17:15,312 --> 00:17:16,842
Jae Seok.

408
00:17:17,142 --> 00:17:18,642
Please save me.

409
00:17:18,642 --> 00:17:19,772
You have 30 seconds.

410
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,142
Jae Seok, just...

411
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:23,812
- Please let me go down. - You've bungee jumped before.

412
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:25,272
(Will it be Jae Seok?)

413
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:27,212
You've bungee jumped before.

414
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,112
I like the ground. Please.

415
00:17:30,242 --> 00:17:31,942
Haha, please save me.

416
00:17:31,942 --> 00:17:33,612
(Please, I'm a total coward.)

417
00:17:34,742 --> 00:17:41,212
(Jae Seok was seen as a coward due to his fear of heights.)

418
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:42,312
It's too high.

419
00:17:42,912 --> 00:17:44,072
I'm so nervous.

420
00:17:44,172 --> 00:17:45,942
(Trembling)

421
00:17:45,942 --> 00:17:49,442
(He loses his mind when he's somewhere high.)

422
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:52,972
I know Jae Seok also hates it. My goodness.

423
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:55,942
- What about Jong Kook? - You have 15 seconds.

424
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,242
I have 15 seconds left!

425
00:17:59,142 --> 00:18:00,942
What about the consequences?

426
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:03,512
I have to make a decision.

427
00:18:03,812 --> 00:18:05,912
(It's time to decide.)

428
00:18:05,912 --> 00:18:08,342
Please, Haha.

429
00:18:08,742 --> 00:18:10,442
Don't make me bungee jump.

430
00:18:10,712 --> 00:18:13,512
No, I can't eat it.

431
00:18:13,812 --> 00:18:16,942
I know Jae Seok hates bungee jumping.

432
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:18,882
- All Jong Kook has to do is eat. - Please.

433
00:18:18,882 --> 00:18:21,472
Sometimes, he wanted to eat junk food.

434
00:18:21,472 --> 00:18:22,972
- Please. - It's just a jump.

435
00:18:22,972 --> 00:18:24,882
- People like bungee jumping. - Please.

436
00:18:25,212 --> 00:18:27,172
I've made my decision.

437
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:35,412
(Jong Kook, the strongest, always protected Haha.)

438
00:18:36,842 --> 00:18:42,112
(Jae Seok, the funniest, always cared for Haha.)

439
00:18:43,472 --> 00:18:45,042
- Please. - I don't know.

440
00:18:45,072 --> 00:18:46,882
- What should I do? - Please.

441
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:51,672
(On the other hand, both embarrassed him, too.)

442
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:55,942
(However, which of them does he like more?)

443
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:56,942
He changed.

444
00:18:58,042 --> 00:18:59,572
I'll save...

445
00:19:00,642 --> 00:19:06,382
(Whom will Haha choose?)

446
00:19:06,382 --> 00:19:07,542
Yu Jae Seok.

447
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:09,772
(Haha chooses Jae Seok.)

448
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:10,942
Yu Jae Seok.

449
00:19:11,612 --> 00:19:13,882
You just have to jump.

450
00:19:16,312 --> 00:19:18,842
No!

451
00:19:18,942 --> 00:19:21,212
You just have to jump.

452
00:19:23,742 --> 00:19:26,142
No!

453
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:30,512
(Jae Seok descends, and Jong Kook rises towards high-calorie foods.)

454
00:19:31,172 --> 00:19:33,772
(Say hello to high-calorie foods.)

455
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:36,612
- No! - Thank you. Thank you!

456
00:19:37,712 --> 00:19:40,712
(I survived.)

457
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:42,142
No.

458
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:43,772
(This can't be happening.)

459
00:19:43,812 --> 00:19:46,842
- No! - Thank you, Producer.

460
00:19:46,842 --> 00:19:50,342
- Call Haha. - Thank you, Cameraman.

461
00:19:50,382 --> 00:19:53,882
Thank you, Sir. Thank you.

462
00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:56,512
Haha saved me.

463
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:58,072
(Haha saved my life.)

464
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,772
I know that Jae Seok has fear of heights...

465
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:05,642
and Jong Kook once told me that he wanted to eat ramyeon.

466
00:20:05,642 --> 00:20:07,042
I remember him telling me.

467
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:09,612
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

468
00:20:09,612 --> 00:20:12,712
What am I to do?

469
00:20:12,842 --> 00:20:14,672
- I'm sorry, Jong Kook! - You are a dead man now!

470
00:20:14,972 --> 00:20:16,812
- I won't forgive you! - I didn't mean to.

471
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,572
You are dead!

472
00:20:18,572 --> 00:20:19,812
Have a nice meal!

473
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:21,842
- I am going to hit you! - Jong Kook.

474
00:20:23,342 --> 00:20:25,912
Why do I have to go up so high to eat?

475
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:28,072
Gosh.

476
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:31,842
- Enjoy it. You wanted it! - You are dead!

477
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:35,212
Thank you, Haha.

478
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:36,612
Oh, my. I'm alive.

479
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:39,612
Jae Seok, I know how it feels like!

480
00:20:40,112 --> 00:20:43,382
It's too high up here.

481
00:20:44,642 --> 00:20:46,112
Why do we have to go up so high?

482
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,112
What am I to do with these?

483
00:20:48,112 --> 00:20:49,312
(High-calorie foods)

484
00:20:49,772 --> 00:20:52,172
It's been years since I had ramyeon.

485
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,342
Haha must have gone crazy.

486
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:01,642
- Haha, thank you. - Jae Seok.

487
00:21:01,772 --> 00:21:03,272
- I'm safe now. - Jae Seok.

488
00:21:03,272 --> 00:21:05,812
- You saved my life. - I know how much you hate it.

489
00:21:05,812 --> 00:21:07,242
I hate bungee jumping.

490
00:21:07,242 --> 00:21:08,742
I hate it too.

491
00:21:08,912 --> 00:21:10,512
Do you know what Jong Kook said?

492
00:21:11,412 --> 00:21:14,412
He said I can simply jump, whereas he can't eat those food.

493
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:16,112
How could he say that?

494
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,942
They are having a dramatic reunion down there.

495
00:21:19,772 --> 00:21:21,042
They seem happy.

496
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:22,572
(Are you guys happy now?)

497
00:21:23,142 --> 00:21:24,842
What am I to do?

498
00:21:27,072 --> 00:21:29,572
Jong Kook will probably thank us.

499
00:21:29,842 --> 00:21:32,882
He wanted to eat ramyeon but didn't have an excuse.

500
00:21:33,112 --> 00:21:35,612
But it's like poison to Jong Kook.

501
00:21:35,612 --> 00:21:36,912
It's over.

502
00:21:37,142 --> 00:21:38,742
Jong Kook is furious.

503
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:42,072
How can you say that?

504
00:21:42,412 --> 00:21:44,812
- What? - How can you say that?

505
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,912
I saved your life.

506
00:21:46,912 --> 00:21:49,012
- I saved your life. - What life?

507
00:21:49,012 --> 00:21:50,542
(What did I do wrong?)

508
00:21:50,912 --> 00:21:52,242
What? Why?

509
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,742
You chose me. So?

510
00:21:55,712 --> 00:21:57,872
Can you please take this off me?

511
00:21:58,072 --> 00:21:59,342
I'm so angry.

512
00:22:00,072 --> 00:22:02,712
(Thanks to Haha, I get to eat hamburgers.)

513
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:03,712
Haha.

514
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:05,872
(Munching)

515
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:09,412
(What's this salty and sugary flavor?)

516
00:22:10,072 --> 00:22:12,542
(Chocolate cake, the highest-calorie food here, is next.)

517
00:22:13,172 --> 00:22:14,412
(Is this what people call, "cake"?)

518
00:22:14,412 --> 00:22:15,512
I can't cut it.

519
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:21,712
(He is eating as if he were chewing on rubber.)

520
00:22:21,972 --> 00:22:23,342
Haha, it's over. Let's go.

521
00:22:23,912 --> 00:22:26,612
- You are heartless. - Why?

522
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:29,212
- How can you change like that? - What?

523
00:22:29,642 --> 00:22:31,572
- It's over. - Don't you feel sorry for him?

524
00:22:31,712 --> 00:22:33,442
I told you already.

525
00:22:33,442 --> 00:22:35,372
How often do you eat ramyeon?

526
00:22:35,742 --> 00:22:37,942
- I eat it 200 days a year. - See?

527
00:22:37,942 --> 00:22:39,812
I eat it at least twice a week.

528
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:42,112
Eating ramyeon once is not so bad.

529
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,042
Jong Kook!

530
00:22:44,512 --> 00:22:47,012
That's enough.

531
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:48,542
I'm sorry, Jong Kook!

532
00:22:49,012 --> 00:22:50,872
Why are you sorry? Let's go.

533
00:22:51,012 --> 00:22:52,312
I'm sorry!

534
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:53,912
Let's go.

535
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:55,442
Enjoy your meal!

536
00:22:55,642 --> 00:22:58,142
Jong Kook, enjoy your meal!

537
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:01,572
Haha must have gone crazy.

538
00:23:01,572 --> 00:23:04,512
(Taking one bite after another, he's having an inner conflict.)

539
00:23:06,242 --> 00:23:09,912
(Along with the amount of calories he consumes, his anger rises.)

540
00:23:10,712 --> 00:23:14,112
(He's eating chocolate as if he were chewing on plastic.)

541
00:23:16,942 --> 00:23:20,642
(He's eating them one by one.)

542
00:23:21,142 --> 00:23:22,312
Ramyeon's next.

543
00:23:22,312 --> 00:23:23,742
(Next up is ramyeon.)

544
00:23:23,742 --> 00:23:24,812
Gosh.

545
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,142
(I did miss ramyeon sometimes...)

546
00:23:27,142 --> 00:23:31,042
(but I never thought I'd eat it today.)

547
00:23:31,972 --> 00:23:33,072
Haha.

548
00:23:34,242 --> 00:23:36,812
(Jong Kook finally eats ramyeon.)

549
00:23:37,172 --> 00:23:38,572
I'm going to hit him hard.

550
00:23:39,312 --> 00:23:40,812
He will regret his choice.

551
00:23:41,842 --> 00:23:42,842
I trusted you.

552
00:23:42,842 --> 00:23:43,912
(That was my fault.)

553
00:23:43,912 --> 00:23:45,042
See you soon.

554
00:23:46,242 --> 00:23:52,642
(I'll have to burn some calories off by dealing with you later.)

555
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:54,942
Jong Kook!

556
00:23:56,042 --> 00:23:57,942
- Hey. - I'm sorry!

557
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,312
Forget it.

558
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:03,112
Jong Kook, send me some kind of signal that you are okay!

559
00:24:03,112 --> 00:24:04,612
- It's over. - 7012!

560
00:24:06,542 --> 00:24:09,642
- Be quiet. - We're one. Let's last forever.

561
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:11,712
Haha, I love you.

562
00:24:11,712 --> 00:24:12,942
This one is hard, too.

563
00:24:12,942 --> 00:24:14,842
- Haha. - What am I to do?

564
00:24:14,842 --> 00:24:15,942
Hello.

565
00:24:16,312 --> 00:24:17,612
I love you, Haha.

566
00:24:17,872 --> 00:24:20,342
- I can even bow down to you. - Haha.

567
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,972
- Oh, my. - I can bow down to you.

568
00:24:21,972 --> 00:24:23,142
- It will be a pleasure. - Can I ask you a favor?

569
00:24:23,142 --> 00:24:24,642
Please let me kneel down.

570
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:27,542
- It's comparatively easier here. - Why is it easier?

571
00:24:27,712 --> 00:24:31,112
As I told you before, you have to choose...

572
00:24:31,112 --> 00:24:33,572
a member to save within five minutes.

573
00:24:34,342 --> 00:24:38,242
(Even if he wants to send them both away, he has to choose one to save.)

574
00:24:38,242 --> 00:24:39,672
I'll tell you one thing.

575
00:24:40,142 --> 00:24:41,642
That was really charming.

576
00:24:41,642 --> 00:24:43,242
Seok Jin's Member's Week is over.

577
00:24:43,612 --> 00:24:44,972
Mine isn't.

578
00:24:44,972 --> 00:24:46,442
- I... - You don't know what I'll do.

579
00:24:46,442 --> 00:24:47,872
Come to think of it,

580
00:24:47,942 --> 00:24:49,842
I have my Member's Week left.

581
00:24:49,842 --> 00:24:52,042
- Think carefully. - I have, for Running Man...

582
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:54,372
Think carefully. Look at me.

583
00:24:54,372 --> 00:24:56,112
- I brought my wife. - Haha.

584
00:24:56,112 --> 00:24:57,242
Are you threatening me?

585
00:24:57,242 --> 00:24:59,072
Do you want to ride this naked next week?

586
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:01,772
Wake up.

587
00:25:01,772 --> 00:25:02,972
Come here and take this off.

588
00:25:04,072 --> 00:25:05,742
- I'll give you five seconds. - He really means it.

589
00:25:05,742 --> 00:25:06,972
- I'll give you five seconds. - You've got to send him off.

590
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,872
- It's too much. - Are you threatening me like this?

591
00:25:08,872 --> 00:25:11,772
Do you want to ride this naked next week?

592
00:25:11,772 --> 00:25:13,412
If that happens,

593
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:14,742
I'll use my Member's Week to make him ride it naked.

594
00:25:14,742 --> 00:25:15,842
- Jae Seok. - I like that.

595
00:25:16,412 --> 00:25:18,312
- What are you doing? - That's a good idea.

596
00:25:18,312 --> 00:25:19,972
- He's being cheeky. - He learned all the bad things...

597
00:25:19,972 --> 00:25:22,142
- from the other members. - I didn't mean it.

598
00:25:22,142 --> 00:25:25,142
Tell me a good memory you had with me. Be concise.

599
00:25:25,312 --> 00:25:28,072
Haha, during the seven years of Running Man,

600
00:25:28,072 --> 00:25:31,212
I can never forget the day...

601
00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:33,972
- we fought in the mud. - It was incredible.

602
00:25:35,012 --> 00:25:36,812
- That day... - It was incredible.

603
00:25:36,942 --> 00:25:38,712
It was incredible.

604
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:44,912
(Do you remember the feeling of adrenaline flowing that day?)

605
00:25:44,912 --> 00:25:46,072
It's incredible.

606
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:51,242
(Some say it felt like Jung Woo Sung and Lee Jung Jae fighting.)

607
00:25:51,372 --> 00:25:53,112
It was incredible.

608
00:25:53,112 --> 00:25:54,312
I know what you mean.

609
00:25:54,572 --> 00:25:56,242
- It was incredible. - You remember, right?

610
00:25:56,242 --> 00:25:59,272
- However, looking back, - Haha.

611
00:25:59,272 --> 00:26:01,842
- I've spent a lot of time... - Haha.

612
00:26:01,842 --> 00:26:03,542
With Kwang Soo.

613
00:26:05,612 --> 00:26:09,042
(They share the DNA of betrayal.)

614
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:12,742
(They have a strong friendship amidst suspicion and resentment.)

615
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:15,112
I love you both so much. You know that.

616
00:26:15,772 --> 00:26:17,712
I love you, too.

617
00:26:17,712 --> 00:26:21,042
Raise your hand if you want to volunteer for me.

618
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:22,872
- I can. - Okay.

619
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,412
- For you... - Okay.

620
00:26:24,412 --> 00:26:25,712
- It has been decided. - Wait!

621
00:26:25,712 --> 00:26:27,442
(Why do you say okay?)

622
00:26:27,512 --> 00:26:28,672
It has been decided.

623
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:30,642
- Wait, no. - Thank you, Kwang Soo.

624
00:26:30,642 --> 00:26:32,642
Haha, please.

625
00:26:32,642 --> 00:26:34,242
- Don't do this to me. - Thank you, Kwang Soo.

626
00:26:34,242 --> 00:26:35,712
For further reference,

627
00:26:35,712 --> 00:26:38,642
it's a ride for two.

628
00:26:38,942 --> 00:26:43,042
If you decide on the member, his cameraman has to ride it with him.

629
00:26:43,872 --> 00:26:45,172
Yoo Seok.

630
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:46,942
- Yoo Seok. - Yoo Seok.

631
00:26:46,942 --> 00:26:48,272
Yoon Sang, you told me that you have diarrhea.

632
00:26:48,272 --> 00:26:51,172
Yoo Seok, say something.

633
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:53,642
- Yoo Seok told me he wants to try. - Really?

634
00:26:53,642 --> 00:26:54,742
Don't lie.

635
00:26:54,742 --> 00:26:57,442
- They are professional liars. - Or Haha...

636
00:26:57,442 --> 00:26:58,672
Me, me, me.

637
00:26:59,172 --> 00:27:01,542
- Haha. - Yoo Seok is calling you.

638
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:02,912
- What is he doing? - I visited your restaurant...

639
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:06,572
- three times a week when it opened. - That's right.

640
00:27:06,572 --> 00:27:07,772
That's right.

641
00:27:07,912 --> 00:27:10,642
- That's right. - Look at Yoon Sang.

642
00:27:11,012 --> 00:27:12,312
- That's right. - Yoon Sang has to go now.

643
00:27:12,312 --> 00:27:13,542
You never showed up.

644
00:27:14,512 --> 00:27:15,772
- Yoon Sang. - What is this?

645
00:27:15,772 --> 00:27:18,312
He always went home staggering.

646
00:27:18,312 --> 00:27:19,712
- Yoo Seok. - I remember.

647
00:27:20,112 --> 00:27:22,572
- I remember. - It's decided then.

648
00:27:22,572 --> 00:27:24,072
- It's decided. - Okay, I've decided.

649
00:27:24,412 --> 00:27:26,112
- Wait. - Kwang Soo doesn't have memories.

650
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:27,372
He went to the restaurant...

651
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:29,242
Why didn't you go?

652
00:27:29,242 --> 00:27:32,642
I choose Seok Jin.

653
00:27:32,642 --> 00:27:34,242
(Haha chooses to save Seok Jin.)

654
00:27:34,442 --> 00:27:35,772
That's right.

655
00:27:36,372 --> 00:27:37,512
Really?

656
00:27:38,272 --> 00:27:40,072
- Really? - You helped a lot.

657
00:27:40,072 --> 00:27:42,542
I had a hard time then.

658
00:27:42,542 --> 00:27:44,912
- I went there a lot, too. - I know.

659
00:27:44,912 --> 00:27:46,012
My voice is hoarse.

660
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:49,442
- I know but Yoo Seok helped a lot. - Really?

661
00:27:49,442 --> 00:27:50,742
Yoo Seok.

662
00:27:50,742 --> 00:27:52,012
Blame Yoon Sang.

663
00:27:52,012 --> 00:27:53,442
Well done!

664
00:27:53,442 --> 00:27:56,112
- It's because of Yoon Sang. - Why didn't you go?

665
00:27:56,112 --> 00:27:58,512
- I'm sorry, Kwang Soo. - Do I really have to ride this?

666
00:27:58,512 --> 00:28:00,572
(Am I riding this because I ate less pork entrails?)

667
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,572
- I actually texted your wife. - What did you say?

668
00:28:04,012 --> 00:28:05,212
I asked her to persuade you.

669
00:28:05,942 --> 00:28:07,572
I texted her because of you.

670
00:28:07,572 --> 00:28:10,372
(However, Byul checked the text two hours later.)

671
00:28:11,372 --> 00:28:14,372
Why didn't you eat pork entrails? Why didn't you visit the restaurant?

672
00:28:16,412 --> 00:28:17,842
I don't like pork entrails.

673
00:28:17,842 --> 00:28:18,972
But why...

674
00:28:19,112 --> 00:28:21,012
Why don't you like pork entrails?

675
00:28:21,312 --> 00:28:23,772
- I'm sorry Kwang Soo. I love you. - I'm sorry, too.

676
00:28:23,772 --> 00:28:25,042
You understand, right?

677
00:28:25,042 --> 00:28:26,672
I still have Member's Week left.

678
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:28,812
- I'm really sorry. - I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

679
00:28:28,972 --> 00:28:31,542
Yoon Sang. I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

680
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:33,242
Let's start!

681
00:28:33,242 --> 00:28:36,972
- Please save me. - The cameraman looks more scared.

682
00:28:37,642 --> 00:28:40,742
- What? Why aren't we going? - What's happening?

683
00:28:43,572 --> 00:28:46,442
(Kwang Soo and Yoon Sang shoot up to the sky.)

684
00:28:47,242 --> 00:28:49,642
(It's a vertical takeoff towards space.)

685
00:28:51,112 --> 00:28:53,442
(The gravity is pulling down their faces.)

686
00:28:55,142 --> 00:28:57,472
(Surprised)

687
00:28:58,142 --> 00:29:01,172
(Lee Kwang Soo and Choi Yoon Sang aboard. Apollo 7012 takes off.)

688
00:29:07,572 --> 00:29:10,772
(Are you listening, Earth?)

689
00:29:10,772 --> 00:29:13,612
(Do you copy? Is anyone there?)

690
00:29:14,142 --> 00:29:15,472
(I, Lee Kwang Soo, )

691
00:29:15,472 --> 00:29:18,372
(finally became Prince Universe from Asia Prince.)

692
00:29:19,412 --> 00:29:22,842
(The history of the universe has been rewritten.)

693
00:29:24,742 --> 00:29:26,112
(Shrieking)

694
00:29:26,112 --> 00:29:27,512
(Screaming)

695
00:29:28,472 --> 00:29:31,212
(It looks like his face is weighed down by 10 times the gravity.)

696
00:29:32,372 --> 00:29:35,112
(He drools.)

697
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:38,842
(They really don't look charming.)

698
00:29:38,842 --> 00:29:39,842
Look at Yoon Sang.

699
00:29:40,642 --> 00:29:41,942
(He spits out gibberish.)

700
00:29:41,942 --> 00:29:43,212
Look at Yoon Sang.

701
00:29:43,442 --> 00:29:46,612
(He loses his speaking ability due to zero gravity.)

702
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:49,612
(Earth is much better than space.)

703
00:29:53,412 --> 00:29:55,542
(They reach stable orbit.)

704
00:29:55,542 --> 00:29:57,212
It looks doable.

705
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:03,242
(Welcome back to Earth.)

706
00:30:03,842 --> 00:30:05,172
I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

707
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:07,812
Wasn't it fun, Yoon Sang?

708
00:30:08,242 --> 00:30:10,342
I thought only the ball would fly off.

709
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:11,342
(They pretend to have enjoyed it.)

710
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:13,012
Wasn't it better than you thought?

711
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:15,312
(Kwang Soo's Week will feature dark scenarios.)

712
00:30:15,312 --> 00:30:16,812
Good job, Kwang Soo.

713
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:18,272
Let's go.

714
00:30:18,272 --> 00:30:19,312
(They move to the third location.)

715
00:30:19,312 --> 00:30:20,442
It's freezing.

716
00:30:21,242 --> 00:30:22,372
Jong Kook.

717
00:30:22,372 --> 00:30:25,672
You look good together as a team.

718
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:28,042
- It looks great. - Did you enjoy the food?

719
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:29,512
What a team.

720
00:30:29,512 --> 00:30:31,112
What did I do?

721
00:30:31,272 --> 00:30:32,672
Jong Kook. Kwang Soo.

722
00:30:32,672 --> 00:30:34,312
- What did I do? - What's this?

723
00:30:34,312 --> 00:30:35,312
What's this?

724
00:30:35,472 --> 00:30:37,242
(Jae Seok spots grasshoppers.)

725
00:30:37,242 --> 00:30:38,642
Save me, Jae Seok.

726
00:30:38,642 --> 00:30:41,442
- Isn't this an anaconda? - Save me, Jae Seok.

727
00:30:41,442 --> 00:30:43,212
Isn't this what Byung Man eats?

728
00:30:43,212 --> 00:30:46,142
They must have brought it from the jungle.

729
00:30:46,142 --> 00:30:47,772
Isn't this an anaconda or something?

730
00:30:47,772 --> 00:30:49,542
- It looks like a dragon. - What are they?

731
00:30:49,572 --> 00:30:51,542
What am I supposed to do?

732
00:30:52,212 --> 00:30:54,112
This is driving me crazy.

733
00:30:54,112 --> 00:30:56,042
What am I supposed to do?

734
00:30:56,042 --> 00:30:58,142
All right. Jong Kook and Kwang Soo,

735
00:30:58,312 --> 00:31:00,372
put your heads in the punishment box.

736
00:31:00,642 --> 00:31:02,712
Put your heads in the punishment box.

737
00:31:02,772 --> 00:31:05,242
(Put our heads in the punishment box?)

738
00:31:05,242 --> 00:31:07,042
(Why do we...)

739
00:31:07,042 --> 00:31:08,442
(have to...)

740
00:31:08,442 --> 00:31:11,372
(do this again?)

741
00:31:12,672 --> 00:31:14,412
- Why would we do that? - You want us to put our heads in?

742
00:31:14,412 --> 00:31:16,212
(It's all your fault, Haha.)

743
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:18,042
Is this a punishment?

744
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,672
It already upsets me that I didn't get chosen.

745
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,712
It's your third decision time.

746
00:31:22,742 --> 00:31:26,312
There's Ji Hyo or Jong Kook and Kwang Soo.

747
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,442
Within five minutes,

748
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:30,642
you must choose which member to save.

749
00:31:30,642 --> 00:31:32,042
What? From them?

750
00:31:32,042 --> 00:31:35,112
You can choose Ji Hyo or Jong Kook and Kwang Soo.

751
00:31:35,112 --> 00:31:36,642
You must make up your mind.

752
00:31:36,642 --> 00:31:39,772
I'll be abandoning her twice.

753
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,742
(What did I do so wrong?)

754
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:45,372
The member that doesn't get picked with receive punishment.

755
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:49,512
Ji Hyo has to put her hand in the insect box.

756
00:31:49,512 --> 00:31:50,842
(She has to touch the insects in the box.)

757
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:54,512
(Ji Hyo is scared of insects.)

758
00:31:55,442 --> 00:31:58,642
Every time a minute passes, the box will get closer to her.

759
00:31:59,772 --> 00:32:01,942
The member that doesn't get chosen...

760
00:32:01,942 --> 00:32:04,542
will receive the punishment in the punishment box.

761
00:32:04,742 --> 00:32:06,742
(It's hard to gauge how much fear they'll be in.)

762
00:32:07,072 --> 00:32:10,312
(There's also a fear of the unknown.)

763
00:32:10,312 --> 00:32:12,412
- Save me, Haha. - You're supposed...

764
00:32:12,412 --> 00:32:15,112
to do this at the end. Why would you do this from the start?

765
00:32:15,112 --> 00:32:16,572
Isn't this too much?

766
00:32:16,572 --> 00:32:17,842
Haha.

767
00:32:17,842 --> 00:32:20,042
- You have five minutes. - Haha.

768
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:22,742
- It's decision time. - This is driving me crazy.

769
00:32:22,742 --> 00:32:24,572
Is Ji Hyo supposed to touch that?

770
00:32:24,572 --> 00:32:26,572
Haha, it's me.

771
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:29,012
- I don't know what to do. - For goodness' sake.

772
00:32:29,012 --> 00:32:31,142
It just moved. What now?

773
00:32:31,142 --> 00:32:32,442
(They get louder.)

774
00:32:32,442 --> 00:32:34,172
Why are you coming closer? Hold on.

775
00:32:34,642 --> 00:32:36,042
(With every minute passing, the insects get closer to Ji Hyo.)

776
00:32:36,042 --> 00:32:37,642
- I don't know what to do. - Isn't this too much?

777
00:32:37,642 --> 00:32:40,212
This is too much.

778
00:32:40,212 --> 00:32:41,672
Haha.

779
00:32:41,842 --> 00:32:43,942
I'm going to keep it inside forever.

780
00:32:44,412 --> 00:32:46,142
(Are you going to betray us twice?)

781
00:32:46,672 --> 00:32:48,642
(They are about to crawl out.)

782
00:32:48,642 --> 00:32:50,612
How am I supposed to save you?

783
00:32:50,612 --> 00:32:52,942
(He can't make her touch the insects because she's frightened of them.)

784
00:32:52,942 --> 00:32:54,672
What am I supposed to do?

785
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:58,112
(Jong Kook and Kwang Soo have been hurt already.)

786
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,342
- You have one minute left. - This is driving me crazy.

787
00:33:00,342 --> 00:33:01,672
- My gosh. - Haha.

788
00:33:01,672 --> 00:33:05,312
Haha. I love you.

789
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:07,772
- I'm being serious. - Don't do this.

790
00:33:07,772 --> 00:33:08,942
(She loves him out of fear.)

791
00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:11,212
It's already over between us.

792
00:33:11,212 --> 00:33:12,542
You used to like me in the beginning.

793
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:15,042
- We had a love triangle. - Come on, I...

794
00:33:15,942 --> 00:33:18,242
(Don't you remember, Haha?)

795
00:33:18,242 --> 00:33:19,612
You're just pretty.

796
00:33:20,312 --> 00:33:22,042
(You said I was the prettiest girl in the world.)

797
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:26,142
(You used to take good care of me.)

798
00:33:26,142 --> 00:33:27,942
I didn't like you.

799
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:30,642
- Come on, Haha. - You have 10 seconds.

800
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:32,472
- Save me this once. - This is driving me crazy.

801
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:34,412
- What am I supposed to do? - Haha.

802
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,672
- Kwang Soo, tell me it's okay. - I'll be...

803
00:33:35,672 --> 00:33:37,512
- good to you all my life! - Four, three,

804
00:33:37,512 --> 00:33:39,612
- two, one. - Kwang Soo.

805
00:33:40,142 --> 00:33:41,472
What's your decision, Haha?

806
00:33:41,472 --> 00:33:42,742
(Haha runs out of time.)

807
00:33:44,242 --> 00:33:49,112
(Would he be a gentleman and save Ji Hyo from the insects?)

808
00:33:49,942 --> 00:33:52,242
(Or...)

809
00:33:53,142 --> 00:33:55,042
I won't let this one go.

810
00:33:55,372 --> 00:33:59,242
(Would he save the two members whom he betrayed already?)

811
00:33:59,742 --> 00:34:01,042
Please, Haha.

812
00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:02,942
- Haha. - Haha.

813
00:34:06,142 --> 00:34:08,342
I'll save Ji Hyo.

814
00:34:08,342 --> 00:34:10,742
(That must have been a difficult decision.)

815
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:13,312
How was Ji Hyo supposed to put her hand in?

816
00:34:13,312 --> 00:34:15,072
Haha!

817
00:34:15,142 --> 00:34:17,412
I'm sorry, Jong Kook. I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

818
00:34:18,412 --> 00:34:19,412
(Collapsing)

819
00:34:20,212 --> 00:34:22,472
Ji Hyo.

820
00:34:23,112 --> 00:34:24,342
Where are you going?

821
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:27,512
(Her legs give out.)

822
00:34:27,512 --> 00:34:29,242
What's wrong with you?

823
00:34:29,242 --> 00:34:31,282
Stop it, Ji Hyo.

824
00:34:31,472 --> 00:34:33,672
You're saved.

825
00:34:33,842 --> 00:34:35,542
(The punishment box opens.)

826
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:37,412
What did I do to you?

827
00:34:37,412 --> 00:34:39,742
- Watch, Haha. - Why am I doing this?

828
00:34:39,742 --> 00:34:41,942
My goodness. Haha.

829
00:34:41,942 --> 00:34:42,942
(We have to live.)

830
00:34:42,942 --> 00:34:44,042
I'm sorry.

831
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:45,042
(Rest of them are on their way.)

832
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:47,372
I remember the old times.

833
00:34:47,372 --> 00:34:50,742
- I have to decide for myself. - Really?

834
00:34:50,742 --> 00:34:53,212
Why are you so indecisive? Just do it.

835
00:34:53,212 --> 00:34:54,442
It's hard for me.

836
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:55,912
You are...

837
00:34:55,912 --> 00:34:57,842
so indecisive. How are you supposed to survive in this world?

838
00:34:57,842 --> 00:34:59,112
Exactly.

839
00:34:59,112 --> 00:35:00,142
I...

840
00:35:00,782 --> 00:35:03,812
bought land on the day I checked it out.

841
00:35:03,842 --> 00:35:07,542
Seok Jin is too rash.

842
00:35:08,842 --> 00:35:09,912
Hey.

843
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:13,842
If I was a bad guy, I would have made Seok Jin homeless.

844
00:35:13,842 --> 00:35:16,212
Hey. When I retire,

845
00:35:16,212 --> 00:35:18,342
I'm going to backstab you first.

846
00:35:18,342 --> 00:35:19,942
He gets defrauded easily.

847
00:35:20,112 --> 00:35:21,542
I don't anymore.

848
00:35:22,812 --> 00:35:24,672
You won't have to decide again, right? What do you think?

849
00:35:24,672 --> 00:35:27,282
- I think it continues. - I think it's for the entire day.

850
00:35:27,282 --> 00:35:29,642
My gosh. Do I have to flatter you all day?

851
00:35:29,842 --> 00:35:32,142
That's not nice, Seok Jin.

852
00:35:32,142 --> 00:35:33,842
It doesn't suit my personality.

853
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:35,672
It suits you perfectly, Seok Jin.

854
00:35:36,412 --> 00:35:37,742
You're the best at it.

855
00:35:37,742 --> 00:35:40,542
- I'm usually quiet. - You're Flatter Jee.

856
00:35:41,442 --> 00:35:45,112
(Flatter Jee, flatter, flatter)

857
00:35:45,112 --> 00:35:48,512
Flatter Jee, flatter, flatter.

858
00:35:48,512 --> 00:35:49,912
(This is his third nickname.)

859
00:35:49,912 --> 00:35:52,512
It's your song.

860
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,212
You should talk back to him.

861
00:35:55,212 --> 00:35:56,412
I think he's funny.

862
00:35:56,412 --> 00:35:58,112
(He just thinks it's funny.)

863
00:35:58,112 --> 00:35:59,842
Flatter Jee, Flatter Jee.

864
00:35:59,842 --> 00:36:01,442
(Dancing)

865
00:36:01,642 --> 00:36:06,212
(The chosen ones are on their way to a restaurant.)

866
00:36:06,212 --> 00:36:08,142
What did I ever do wrong?

867
00:36:08,142 --> 00:36:10,542
How long do I have to be in here for?

868
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:12,012
It's over.

869
00:36:12,012 --> 00:36:13,012
(He pops his head out.)

870
00:36:13,012 --> 00:36:14,742
What did I do to you?

871
00:36:14,742 --> 00:36:16,112
(He gets a makeover.)

872
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:20,442
(His lips are intensely red and his mustache is alluring.)

873
00:36:20,842 --> 00:36:22,912
(Jong Kook is next.)

874
00:36:23,342 --> 00:36:25,742
You need professionals for this.

875
00:36:25,742 --> 00:36:27,342
(He also gets a makeover.)

876
00:36:28,342 --> 00:36:29,542
(They're shocked by each other's faces.)

877
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:31,282
This is too...

878
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:33,672
I take it back. Can I be in a different team?

879
00:36:33,672 --> 00:36:35,742
- I accept my mistakes. - Hey.

880
00:36:35,742 --> 00:36:36,942
- Can I be in a different team? - Come on.

881
00:36:37,012 --> 00:36:39,112
(This is too beautiful to be aired on television.)

882
00:36:39,112 --> 00:36:40,112
What am I supposed to say to this?

883
00:36:40,112 --> 00:36:42,972
Wait. You actually have a theme to your makeup.

884
00:36:43,012 --> 00:36:44,472
(What theme?)

885
00:36:44,472 --> 00:36:45,542
What are you supposed to be?

886
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:46,782
(Jong Kook's makeup looks futuristic.)

887
00:36:46,782 --> 00:36:47,782
What am I supposed to say about this?

888
00:36:47,782 --> 00:36:49,672
He has a theme to his makeup. What about me?

889
00:36:49,672 --> 00:36:51,342
- He looks disgusting. - What did you say?

890
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:54,042
How am I supposed to have this on all day?

891
00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:56,872
Can you take off his hairpin? It's really scary.

892
00:36:57,142 --> 00:36:59,242
(Is he a clown or an entertaining beggar?)

893
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:02,042
You must be either one of them.

894
00:37:02,742 --> 00:37:06,742
(Jong Kook and Kwang Soo's revenge starts now.)

895
00:37:07,572 --> 00:37:09,042
(The survivors are at a Korean restaurant nearby.)

896
00:37:09,042 --> 00:37:11,042
Thank you, Haha.

897
00:37:11,042 --> 00:37:13,242
- Come in. - This is amazing.

898
00:37:13,242 --> 00:37:14,572
(It's a feast.)

899
00:37:14,572 --> 00:37:16,942
- This is amazing. - I'm so hungry.

900
00:37:16,942 --> 00:37:18,572
Isn't this fried smelt?

901
00:37:18,572 --> 00:37:19,642
(The table is filled with delicious dishes.)

902
00:37:19,642 --> 00:37:22,472
This is such a great plan.

903
00:37:22,472 --> 00:37:23,472
(What would Haha have to decide in front of the food?)

904
00:37:23,472 --> 00:37:25,142
- Haha. - Haha.

905
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:27,512
- Haha. - Haha.

906
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:30,212
I have a question, Sir. The two left behind.

907
00:37:30,742 --> 00:37:31,942
Would they not come here?

908
00:37:31,942 --> 00:37:33,572
- They won't come. - Really?

909
00:37:33,572 --> 00:37:35,812
Do I have to decide from this group?

910
00:37:36,312 --> 00:37:37,312
(Laughing)

911
00:37:37,372 --> 00:37:39,072
That little Haha...

912
00:37:39,242 --> 00:37:42,412
(Are you happily eating warm food?)

913
00:37:43,212 --> 00:37:44,542
I see.

914
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:45,842
(We understand, Haha.)

915
00:37:45,842 --> 00:37:47,212
I'm speechless.

916
00:37:47,212 --> 00:37:49,542
(Laughing)

917
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:53,472
That was a big mistake.

918
00:37:55,372 --> 00:37:57,512
You have to be good.

919
00:37:57,512 --> 00:37:59,742
In front of you is...

920
00:37:59,942 --> 00:38:01,782
a table full of food...

921
00:38:01,782 --> 00:38:04,642
or a triangle gimbap and a yogurt drink.

922
00:38:04,642 --> 00:38:07,112
If Haha chooses to eat the food from the table,

923
00:38:07,282 --> 00:38:10,412
the rest of the members must share the gimbap...

924
00:38:10,412 --> 00:38:12,742
- and the yogurt drink. - Sorry?

925
00:38:12,742 --> 00:38:16,412
If Haha chooses to eat the gimbap and the drink,

926
00:38:16,442 --> 00:38:18,142
the rest will have good food.

927
00:38:18,142 --> 00:38:20,112
- Excuse me. - Excuse me.

928
00:38:20,112 --> 00:38:22,242
- That doesn't make any sense. - You're not making any sense.

929
00:38:22,242 --> 00:38:24,112
- Who would choose otherwise? - Do you think he'll be different?

930
00:38:24,112 --> 00:38:26,042
Why would he choose this over the good food?

931
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:28,042
- Don't you trust me? - He loves to eat.

932
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:31,282
What would you like to choose, Haha?

933
00:38:31,282 --> 00:38:33,942
This is making me so sad.

934
00:38:33,942 --> 00:38:36,442
- I was going to consider. - What is your justification?

935
00:38:36,442 --> 00:38:39,042
I'll give you five minutes. If you can't choose...

936
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:41,142
If you eat the gimbap and we eat the good food...

937
00:38:41,142 --> 00:38:43,742
- That would be nice. - I would be touched.

938
00:38:43,742 --> 00:38:45,312
- Me, too. - Wouldn't Haha's public image...

939
00:38:45,312 --> 00:38:48,542
- look great? - You could've been nicer.

940
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:51,012
- You can't yell... - What are you doing?

941
00:38:51,012 --> 00:38:53,042
- Stop it. - Get back.

942
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:55,142
- He's being too bossy. - Get back.

943
00:38:55,142 --> 00:38:57,042
- This is too much. - I'm bossy?

944
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:58,112
(Do you want to eat gimbap?)

945
00:38:58,112 --> 00:39:00,372
I was actually thinking...

946
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:03,512
how it would look if we did it that way.

947
00:39:03,512 --> 00:39:05,242
If that was your plan, do that.

948
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:08,112
- I'm so disappointed. - Okay.

949
00:39:08,342 --> 00:39:10,842
Please face the wall.

950
00:39:11,072 --> 00:39:14,282
I'm not sure where I'll sit but...

951
00:39:14,572 --> 00:39:17,942
If you sit here, I might cry.

952
00:39:18,212 --> 00:39:20,872
We'll be so touched if you sit here.

953
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:25,142
(Will he have the meal to himself or try to look like a nice person?)

954
00:39:25,812 --> 00:39:28,742
- Seven, six... - Do you remember our trip?

955
00:39:28,872 --> 00:39:30,782
That's right. Haha.

956
00:39:30,782 --> 00:39:32,972
(Do you remember our happy trip?)

957
00:39:33,742 --> 00:39:36,872
(The meat tasted better because they were together.)

958
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:42,312
(They could laugh more because they were together.)

959
00:39:43,212 --> 00:39:45,212
(We were so happy then.)

960
00:39:45,212 --> 00:39:47,072
Turn back on three.

961
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:50,782
One, two, three.

962
00:39:50,782 --> 00:39:53,012
(Even the nicest meal wouldn't taste so good if you ate it alone.)

963
00:39:53,872 --> 00:39:56,282
(Where is Haha sitting after hesitation?)

964
00:39:59,012 --> 00:40:00,212
(He's enjoying the meal himself.)

965
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:01,642
I knew it.

966
00:40:02,072 --> 00:40:03,642
I knew he'd do that.

967
00:40:03,872 --> 00:40:06,172
This is what I was talking about.

968
00:40:06,282 --> 00:40:08,572
Hey.

969
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,842
This is what I meant, Ji Hyo.

970
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:13,542
I was going to have the gimbap.

971
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:16,612
- Don't blame me. Blame Jae Seok. - That's absurd.

972
00:40:16,612 --> 00:40:19,172
- You're lying. - I mean it.

973
00:40:19,172 --> 00:40:21,212
Hold on. Is that your choice?

974
00:40:22,012 --> 00:40:23,142
Haha can...

975
00:40:24,612 --> 00:40:26,712
eat with 1 of the 3.

976
00:40:26,712 --> 00:40:28,342
- Really? - Haha.

977
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:31,112
(They change their attitude right away.)

978
00:40:31,442 --> 00:40:33,472
Haha.

979
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,172
- Haha. - Look at me.

980
00:40:36,172 --> 00:40:37,672
- Hey. - I can eat really well.

981
00:40:37,672 --> 00:40:39,242
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

982
00:40:39,472 --> 00:40:40,782
You should have told us earlier.

983
00:40:40,782 --> 00:40:42,542
- Haha. - Let go of me.

984
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:43,782
- Haha. - Haha.

985
00:40:43,782 --> 00:40:45,042
I'm so sick of you guys.

986
00:40:45,172 --> 00:40:46,842
- Haha. - I'm so tired of you.

987
00:40:46,842 --> 00:40:49,642
- Haha, cheer up - I can't live without Haha.

988
00:40:49,742 --> 00:40:52,112
- I can't live without Haha - I'm sick of you guys.

989
00:40:52,112 --> 00:40:53,612
- I'm so tired. - Haha.

990
00:40:53,612 --> 00:40:55,212
You're our only hope.

991
00:40:55,212 --> 00:40:57,442
You're...

992
00:40:57,572 --> 00:40:59,642
the real hero.

993
00:40:59,642 --> 00:41:00,842
(Haha, you're our only hope. You're the real hero.)

994
00:41:00,872 --> 00:41:03,242
I think Ji Hyo can have the gimbap.

995
00:41:03,242 --> 00:41:04,372
Do you know me?

996
00:41:04,372 --> 00:41:06,172
(Excuse me?)

997
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,942
- Are you my attorney? - That's not it.

998
00:41:08,942 --> 00:41:11,072
Don't touch me.

999
00:41:11,072 --> 00:41:14,042
- Send Ji Hyo to the gimbap. - You're unbelievable.

1000
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:15,342
If you'd like to...

1001
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:17,282
volunteer...

1002
00:41:17,572 --> 00:41:20,672
to have the gimbap, please raise your hand.

1003
00:41:21,372 --> 00:41:23,442
All right, Jae Seok.

1004
00:41:23,642 --> 00:41:26,342
(Jae Seok volunteered.)

1005
00:41:26,342 --> 00:41:27,342
- Wait. - Sit here.

1006
00:41:27,342 --> 00:41:29,472
- Hear me out. - Just sit there.

1007
00:41:29,472 --> 00:41:31,572
- Wait. - Sit.

1008
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,242
Sit here.

1009
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:34,912
Gosh.

1010
00:41:35,212 --> 00:41:36,712
You have 10 seconds.

1011
00:41:36,972 --> 00:41:38,172
10,

1012
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,142
- You're unbelievable. - nine,

1013
00:41:40,142 --> 00:41:42,112
I didn't want to say this but...

1014
00:41:42,342 --> 00:41:43,572
my mom hit me...

1015
00:41:44,072 --> 00:41:46,312
with a triangular ruler when I was a kid.

1016
00:41:47,942 --> 00:41:50,372
He's lying.

1017
00:41:50,372 --> 00:41:53,712
Any triangular objects frighten me.

1018
00:41:53,712 --> 00:41:54,942
(He has a phobia for triangles.)

1019
00:41:54,942 --> 00:41:56,242
All right.

1020
00:41:56,372 --> 00:41:58,542
- Seok Jin... - He's...

1021
00:41:58,542 --> 00:42:00,442
He doesn't even deserve this.

1022
00:42:00,442 --> 00:42:01,672
(Munching)

1023
00:42:02,842 --> 00:42:05,742
Hey, you shouldn't eat it all. You're supposed to share it.

1024
00:42:06,042 --> 00:42:07,542
(He doesn't care.)

1025
00:42:07,542 --> 00:42:08,942
- Did you eat it? - Yes.

1026
00:42:08,942 --> 00:42:10,442
He ate it all.

1027
00:42:10,442 --> 00:42:11,712
You're supposed to share it.

1028
00:42:11,712 --> 00:42:13,282
You're supposed to share it.

1029
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:15,012
(I didn't know.)

1030
00:42:15,012 --> 00:42:16,142
He grabbed it.

1031
00:42:16,282 --> 00:42:18,242
We don't know who'll be sharing it with you.

1032
00:42:19,112 --> 00:42:22,012
The one who doesn't get chosen won't have any lunch.

1033
00:42:22,012 --> 00:42:23,412
(There will be no lunch for one.)

1034
00:42:23,672 --> 00:42:25,072
What's your choice, Haha?

1035
00:42:25,812 --> 00:42:30,212
I'll put a piece of fried smelt in the mouth of the person I choose.

1036
00:42:30,642 --> 00:42:31,812
Close your eyes.

1037
00:42:32,912 --> 00:42:37,842
(Please come to my mouth.)

1038
00:42:38,742 --> 00:42:40,912
- Keep your eyes closed. - Keep them closed.

1039
00:42:41,012 --> 00:42:44,542
(Their lunch depends on Haha.)

1040
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,372
(Jae Seok approaches.)

1041
00:42:46,372 --> 00:42:49,012
One, two, three.

1042
00:42:49,012 --> 00:42:50,972
(Who has the fried smelt?)

1043
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:57,012
(Enjoy the finger.)

1044
00:42:57,572 --> 00:42:59,912
(You brats.)

1045
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:02,312
Hey, come here.

1046
00:43:02,312 --> 00:43:04,782
- You don't have anything. - How dare you make fun of me?

1047
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,842
- That was funny. - Enjoy your lunch.

1048
00:43:06,842 --> 00:43:09,572
(It's finally lunch time.)

1049
00:43:09,572 --> 00:43:10,942
Let's eat.

1050
00:43:11,112 --> 00:43:13,412
Do we have to do this?

1051
00:43:14,972 --> 00:43:16,372
The potatoes are so chubby.

1052
00:43:16,842 --> 00:43:19,142
(Are you happy?)

1053
00:43:19,572 --> 00:43:20,642
Is that potato jeon?

1054
00:43:21,912 --> 00:43:24,172
It's so hard to decide what to start with.

1055
00:43:25,072 --> 00:43:26,242
It's so painful.

1056
00:43:26,242 --> 00:43:28,642
But you seem to be making decisions with no problems.

1057
00:43:28,742 --> 00:43:30,912
- It's too difficult. - That's absurd.

1058
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:32,372
You're so annoying.

1059
00:43:33,112 --> 00:43:36,012
You're being absurd. What's so difficult?

1060
00:43:36,012 --> 00:43:40,412
(Here, you see only dried fish hanging.)

1061
00:43:40,842 --> 00:43:44,312
(The losers arrive at an unknown place.)

1062
00:43:44,312 --> 00:43:46,912
Where are we going now?

1063
00:43:46,912 --> 00:43:48,772
A special lunch is prepared for you.

1064
00:43:49,242 --> 00:43:50,572
- A special lunch? - Are we going to eat?

1065
00:43:50,572 --> 00:43:52,042
(We at least get food.)

1066
00:43:52,042 --> 00:43:53,672
Aren't we going to a restaurant?

1067
00:43:55,742 --> 00:43:58,172
(Ice)

1068
00:43:58,672 --> 00:44:00,312
Aren't we going to a restaurant?

1069
00:44:00,312 --> 00:44:01,842
(At the end of the mysterious mountain path, )

1070
00:44:02,472 --> 00:44:04,112
(they end up having lunch outside.)

1071
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:07,742
(There are two cold lunchboxes and frozen water bottles.)

1072
00:44:09,472 --> 00:44:11,212
Why are there bottles of ice?

1073
00:44:11,772 --> 00:44:12,942
Is the water frozen?

1074
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:15,112
(It froze in a second.)

1075
00:44:16,442 --> 00:44:19,012
(In the cold lunchboxes...)

1076
00:44:19,372 --> 00:44:22,012
- Are we at war? - Is there a war?

1077
00:44:23,172 --> 00:44:24,812
- Are we at war? - Are we refugees?

1078
00:44:25,142 --> 00:44:28,772
Is this how Member's Week works? My turn hasn't come yet.

1079
00:44:28,842 --> 00:44:30,672
Are we at war or something?

1080
00:44:30,942 --> 00:44:32,272
(Let's eat anyway.)

1081
00:44:32,272 --> 00:44:33,372
It tastes good.

1082
00:44:33,442 --> 00:44:36,572
(Wait. It tastes like...)

1083
00:44:37,712 --> 00:44:38,812
(Surprised)

1084
00:44:39,442 --> 00:44:43,912
(Did someone dip the potatoes in honey?)

1085
00:44:44,542 --> 00:44:46,242
Why is it so sweet?

1086
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,442
It's really sweet.

1087
00:44:48,972 --> 00:44:50,672
Is it because we look like beggars?

1088
00:44:51,472 --> 00:44:52,742
(Their costumes perk up their appetites.)

1089
00:44:52,742 --> 00:44:55,312
- This is the best potato I've had. - Me, too.

1090
00:44:55,712 --> 00:44:56,872
It's my first.

1091
00:44:56,872 --> 00:45:00,242
(These potatoes are lovely.)

1092
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:04,442
Is it minus 17°C today?

1093
00:45:04,772 --> 00:45:06,542
It's the coldest day this winter.

1094
00:45:07,542 --> 00:45:09,572
It'll be the coldest day this winter.

1095
00:45:09,572 --> 00:45:11,972
The whole country is frozen.

1096
00:45:14,012 --> 00:45:15,472
Haha is crazy.

1097
00:45:16,242 --> 00:45:17,242
How dare he do this to us?

1098
00:45:17,242 --> 00:45:19,172
(We won't forgive you.)

1099
00:45:21,742 --> 00:45:28,712
(It's such a beautiful, winter scene covered with snow.)

1100
00:45:28,712 --> 00:45:33,272
(The frozen river and the stiff cliff create a beautiful harmony.)

1101
00:45:33,972 --> 00:45:36,772
- This is not okay. - The wind comes through the shoes.

1102
00:45:36,912 --> 00:45:40,342
Seok Jin, that's same for everyone.

1103
00:45:40,342 --> 00:45:43,072
The wind comes through. These are summer shoes.

1104
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:45,012
(On this cold day...)

1105
00:45:45,012 --> 00:45:46,042
What's that?

1106
00:45:46,872 --> 00:45:48,172
- What's that? - What's that?

1107
00:45:51,072 --> 00:45:52,572
- What's that? - What's that?

1108
00:45:53,342 --> 00:45:55,642
Why did you come up with an idea like this?

1109
00:45:55,642 --> 00:46:01,642
(There's a game board on the ice and a backboard on the handrail.)

1110
00:46:01,642 --> 00:46:02,942
- Haha. - Yes?

1111
00:46:02,942 --> 00:46:05,112
- A video clip has arrived. - A video clip?

1112
00:46:05,612 --> 00:46:07,712
Why did you come up with an idea like this?

1113
00:46:08,142 --> 00:46:09,172
Haha.

1114
00:46:10,472 --> 00:46:12,342
You'll regret your choice.

1115
00:46:12,342 --> 00:46:13,872
(How dare you discard us?)

1116
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:15,972
(He looks scary.)

1117
00:46:17,312 --> 00:46:18,572
Did they eat there?

1118
00:46:19,242 --> 00:46:20,412
Haha.

1119
00:46:21,342 --> 00:46:25,142
Is this all that we mean to you?

1120
00:46:25,542 --> 00:46:26,912
We'll show you what revenge is.

1121
00:46:26,912 --> 00:46:31,672
(The video contains a warning about revenge.)

1122
00:46:31,672 --> 00:46:34,142
Everyone,

1123
00:46:34,512 --> 00:46:37,242
- you're going to bungee jump. - We'll make you all feel this cold.

1124
00:46:38,242 --> 00:46:39,612
Run within five minutes.

1125
00:46:39,872 --> 00:46:43,042
See what consequences your choice will bring.

1126
00:46:43,112 --> 00:46:44,172
Be prepared.

1127
00:46:44,572 --> 00:46:45,612
Run!

1128
00:46:45,742 --> 00:46:47,272
We're going to get you.

1129
00:46:47,342 --> 00:46:48,472
Run!

1130
00:46:50,312 --> 00:46:51,412
Run!

1131
00:46:51,412 --> 00:46:52,642
(The choice has brought consequences.)

1132
00:46:52,642 --> 00:46:54,172
- Run within five minutes? - What are we supposed to do?

1133
00:46:54,542 --> 00:46:57,272
They just got a little makeup.

1134
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,312
- What are we supposed to do? - What did we do so wrong?

1135
00:46:59,312 --> 00:47:00,672
This is too much.

1136
00:47:00,672 --> 00:47:01,842
Here are the rules.

1137
00:47:01,942 --> 00:47:05,012
Haha needs to complete the final mission...

1138
00:47:05,012 --> 00:47:07,672
before the losers rip off your name tag to avoid the penalty.

1139
00:47:07,672 --> 00:47:08,742
What am I supposed to do?

1140
00:47:09,812 --> 00:47:11,212
Haha's final mission is...

1141
00:47:11,742 --> 00:47:13,872
putting the ball into the basket five times with your eyes covered.

1142
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:16,042
(He needs to shoot 5 hoops blindfolded.)

1143
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:18,112
Put the ball into the basket five times with your eyes covered.

1144
00:47:18,112 --> 00:47:25,842
(He has to put the ball into the basket five times blindfolded.)

1145
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:29,412
The other members should stall the beggars...

1146
00:47:29,412 --> 00:47:32,672
- by fighting against them. - All right.

1147
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:34,772
If Haha fails,

1148
00:47:35,012 --> 00:47:38,872
all of you will receive the final penalty.

1149
00:47:38,872 --> 00:47:42,112
(The remaining 3 have to share the penalty.)

1150
00:47:42,112 --> 00:47:46,872
(Are we receiving penalty, too?)

1151
00:47:48,042 --> 00:47:50,312
(Today's final penalty)

1152
00:47:50,442 --> 00:47:53,642
(Bungee jumping from 63m high)

1153
00:47:53,842 --> 00:47:56,972
Let me explain how it works.

1154
00:47:56,972 --> 00:47:59,212
You're going to play "Rock-Paper-Scissors",

1155
00:47:59,312 --> 00:48:00,912
"Speedy Eating",

1156
00:48:01,072 --> 00:48:03,942
- and "Icy Slap-Match". - "Icy Slap-Match"?

1157
00:48:03,942 --> 00:48:05,742
Each person will play one game.

1158
00:48:05,742 --> 00:48:07,812
- To stall them? - Yes, you should hold them back.

1159
00:48:07,812 --> 00:48:11,042
Haha is going to...

1160
00:48:11,642 --> 00:48:15,142
try to put the ball into the basket over there on the ice.

1161
00:48:16,072 --> 00:48:17,342
We'll make sure you succeed.

1162
00:48:17,342 --> 00:48:18,542
- My goodness. - Try it.

1163
00:48:18,542 --> 00:48:20,072
- You can do it. - You can do it.

1164
00:48:20,072 --> 00:48:21,812
- Don't worry. - Please go to your positions.

1165
00:48:21,912 --> 00:48:23,572
- With my eyes covered? - Yes.

1166
00:48:23,572 --> 00:48:25,142
We can do this.

1167
00:48:25,142 --> 00:48:26,712
- One, two, three. Let's go. - One, two, three. Let's go.

1168
00:48:26,812 --> 00:48:28,012
Let's avoid the penalty.

1169
00:48:29,472 --> 00:48:33,412
(The death match starts.)

1170
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:36,572
(Careful)

1171
00:48:37,412 --> 00:48:38,612
It's so cold.

1172
00:48:39,112 --> 00:48:40,512
I'll practice a little.

1173
00:48:40,512 --> 00:48:44,712
(He'll fight alone on the ice.)

1174
00:48:44,842 --> 00:48:48,612
(Will he manage?)

1175
00:48:49,542 --> 00:48:52,472
(He's the Michael Jordan of Running Man.)

1176
00:48:52,472 --> 00:48:57,442
(I play basketball with my heart, not my height.)

1177
00:48:57,442 --> 00:49:01,772
(This slippery ice can't stop me.)

1178
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:02,942
(Bouncing)

1179
00:49:03,912 --> 00:49:06,212
(He misses the hoop.)

1180
00:49:06,212 --> 00:49:08,272
Can I make five shots?

1181
00:49:09,272 --> 00:49:11,172
I should shoot it like this.

1182
00:49:12,642 --> 00:49:15,042
(That was not even close.)

1183
00:49:15,042 --> 00:49:18,172
(He keeps missing the hoop with his eyes open.)

1184
00:49:18,172 --> 00:49:19,342
(The ball rolls away.)

1185
00:49:19,342 --> 00:49:20,472
I'm sorry.

1186
00:49:21,142 --> 00:49:22,542
(Will he be penalized?)

1187
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,372
We're on a frozen river.

1188
00:49:24,912 --> 00:49:26,772
This is a frozen river.

1189
00:49:27,842 --> 00:49:29,312
This is unbelievable.

1190
00:49:29,742 --> 00:49:31,242
The river is completely frozen.

1191
00:49:31,242 --> 00:49:32,612
(Ji Hyo will play "Icy Slap-Match".)

1192
00:49:33,342 --> 00:49:36,342
Gosh, we're standing on a frozen river.

1193
00:49:37,472 --> 00:49:40,812
(Will she also play well on ice?)

1194
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:43,612
My goodness, this is crazy.

1195
00:49:44,612 --> 00:49:45,872
(How about a Popsicle?)

1196
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:48,812
(Mixing the hot and the cold is key.)

1197
00:49:48,812 --> 00:49:49,972
Gosh, it's cold.

1198
00:49:50,372 --> 00:49:53,312
I'll play rock. If it's paper,

1199
00:49:54,172 --> 00:49:55,442
I'll play scissors.

1200
00:49:55,442 --> 00:49:56,542
(He has to go over the rules first.)

1201
00:49:57,542 --> 00:50:00,442
(Which team will win?)

1202
00:50:01,012 --> 00:50:05,742
(They put on black gloves. They have thick red lipstick on.)

1203
00:50:05,742 --> 00:50:07,812
(You won't find such gangsters anywhere.)

1204
00:50:07,812 --> 00:50:09,072
What do we have to do?

1205
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:11,942
(They're Kwang Soo and Jong Kook.)

1206
00:50:13,872 --> 00:50:16,272
One of my socks is wet, so I took it off.

1207
00:50:16,942 --> 00:50:19,372
(Kwang Soo isn't wearing a sock.)

1208
00:50:19,372 --> 00:50:21,072
How can they treat me like this?

1209
00:50:21,342 --> 00:50:22,912
Please save us.

1210
00:50:22,972 --> 00:50:25,412
What's going on? Where should we go?

1211
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:29,042
(While suppressing their anger, they enter the kingdom of ice.)

1212
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:31,342
(They're finally here.)

1213
00:50:31,342 --> 00:50:33,012
What happened to your face?

1214
00:50:33,012 --> 00:50:35,042
It's nice to be in nature.

1215
00:50:35,042 --> 00:50:37,742
Come on. It wasn't my fault.

1216
00:50:38,042 --> 00:50:39,142
I'm innocent.

1217
00:50:39,872 --> 00:50:41,412
Please, Jong Kook.

1218
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,612
(Jong Kook's anger rises.)

1219
00:50:43,612 --> 00:50:45,772
- Seok Jin. - You look cute.

1220
00:50:45,772 --> 00:50:47,212
Here are the rules.

1221
00:50:47,742 --> 00:50:50,772
The first match to protect Haha is called...

1222
00:50:50,772 --> 00:50:52,672
"Rock-Paper-Scissors".

1223
00:50:53,012 --> 00:50:55,142
You must win three consecutive rounds...

1224
00:50:55,142 --> 00:50:57,942
You must win three consecutive rounds to pass.

1225
00:50:57,942 --> 00:50:59,512
Three consecutive rounds?

1226
00:51:00,812 --> 00:51:02,972
- I tell you what I'll play. - Okay.

1227
00:51:02,972 --> 00:51:04,972
- You can win, Kwang Soo. - Let's play.

1228
00:51:05,172 --> 00:51:08,072
- Let's go, Haha. - Let's go.

1229
00:51:08,842 --> 00:51:10,712
Good luck, Haha.

1230
00:51:10,872 --> 00:51:12,712
Please put on the blindfold.

1231
00:51:12,712 --> 00:51:14,042
(Haha's performance will determine everything.)

1232
00:51:14,042 --> 00:51:16,312
I have no sense of direction at all.

1233
00:51:18,272 --> 00:51:21,912
Make it in the hoop five times. Get ready, set, go.

1234
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,412
(Protecting Haha starts.)

1235
00:51:24,412 --> 00:51:29,242
(Haha shoots his first ball.)

1236
00:51:30,442 --> 00:51:32,412
(He misses.)

1237
00:51:32,412 --> 00:51:33,712
You missed.

1238
00:51:33,712 --> 00:51:34,842
Did I miss it?

1239
00:51:34,872 --> 00:51:36,112
(When will he do it 5 times?)

1240
00:51:36,342 --> 00:51:37,712
- I'll play rock. - Rock?

1241
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,672
- I'll play paper. - Okay.

1242
00:51:41,212 --> 00:51:44,612
(Do you remember, Kwang Soo?)

1243
00:51:44,612 --> 00:51:49,542
(Their "Rock-Paper-Scissors" was very competitive.)

1244
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:51,372
(Seok Jin is the king of rock-paper-scissors.)

1245
00:51:51,372 --> 00:51:52,472
- I'll play rock. - Rock?

1246
00:51:52,472 --> 00:51:54,042
- I'll play paper. - Okay.

1247
00:51:54,042 --> 00:51:57,572
(Will Kwang Soo defeat the legendary player Seok Jin?)

1248
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:59,942
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1249
00:52:00,472 --> 00:52:01,542
Okay.

1250
00:52:01,542 --> 00:52:04,772
(Kwang Soo wins.)

1251
00:52:04,772 --> 00:52:06,042
(Seok Jin got weak.)

1252
00:52:06,042 --> 00:52:08,312
- We have two more rounds. - Let's go.

1253
00:52:08,312 --> 00:52:09,612
What will you play?

1254
00:52:09,772 --> 00:52:11,242
- I'll play rock. - Me, too.

1255
00:52:11,242 --> 00:52:12,742
- I'll play rock. - Me, too.

1256
00:52:12,742 --> 00:52:14,112
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1257
00:52:14,572 --> 00:52:16,142
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1258
00:52:16,142 --> 00:52:17,142
(What's the result?)

1259
00:52:17,142 --> 00:52:18,412
- I'll play rock. - Me, too.

1260
00:52:18,412 --> 00:52:19,942
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1261
00:52:20,042 --> 00:52:23,242
(Kwang Soo wins again.)

1262
00:52:24,112 --> 00:52:25,472
- You won. - What will you play?

1263
00:52:25,472 --> 00:52:26,942
- What will you play? - I'll play scissors.

1264
00:52:26,942 --> 00:52:28,512
- Scissors? - It's the last.

1265
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:30,772
Just win this round.

1266
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:34,472
(Will they defeat Seok Jin and pass through?)

1267
00:52:34,472 --> 00:52:39,242
(The fate of Haha's team depends on Seok Jin's performance.)

1268
00:52:39,242 --> 00:52:41,512
(Buy us more time, Seok Jin.)

1269
00:52:42,342 --> 00:52:45,642
(What's the result of "Rock-Paper-Scissors"?)

1270
00:52:45,642 --> 00:52:48,442
Rock-paper-scissors.

1271
00:52:49,172 --> 00:52:50,512
Rock-paper-scissors.

1272
00:52:50,742 --> 00:52:54,042
(Amazingly, Kwang Soo wins again.)

1273
00:52:54,042 --> 00:52:59,112
(Jong Kook and Kwang Soo win 3 consecutive rounds.)

1274
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:02,372
Ji Hyo should have played it instead.

1275
00:53:03,142 --> 00:53:04,342
Oh, no.

1276
00:53:04,742 --> 00:53:05,812
No, Seok Jin.

1277
00:53:05,812 --> 00:53:08,812
Jong Kook and Kwang Soo win. Please go to the next game.

1278
00:53:08,812 --> 00:53:10,512
(Jong Kook and Kwang Soo take off.)

1279
00:53:10,512 --> 00:53:11,712
I'm so annoyed.

1280
00:53:11,712 --> 00:53:14,842
(They run angrily to the next game.)

1281
00:53:16,412 --> 00:53:17,612
Please.

1282
00:53:18,142 --> 00:53:20,142
(He shoots the ball and misses.)

1283
00:53:20,472 --> 00:53:22,112
My goodness.

1284
00:53:22,642 --> 00:53:24,572
(He focuses.)

1285
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:29,172
- You made it. - Did I?

1286
00:53:29,542 --> 00:53:30,672
(Haha scores one.)

1287
00:53:30,672 --> 00:53:31,772
Did I make it?

1288
00:53:31,772 --> 00:53:33,242
- You made it. - Did I?

1289
00:53:34,612 --> 00:53:37,142
(Jong Kook and Kwang Soo approach Jae Seok.)

1290
00:53:37,142 --> 00:53:38,742
They look hilarious.

1291
00:53:39,072 --> 00:53:41,672
It serves you right, Jong Kook.

1292
00:53:42,442 --> 00:53:44,572
I'll take revenge on you.

1293
00:53:45,172 --> 00:53:47,442
- It serves you right. - Jae Seok.

1294
00:53:47,472 --> 00:53:48,742
Here are the rules.

1295
00:53:49,042 --> 00:53:51,172
The second match to protect Haha is called...

1296
00:53:51,512 --> 00:53:54,042
"Speedy Eating".

1297
00:53:54,042 --> 00:53:55,442
(The game is called "Speedy Eating".)

1298
00:53:55,512 --> 00:53:58,072
It's called "Speedy Eating".

1299
00:53:58,072 --> 00:54:00,812
(The first to finish eating wins.)

1300
00:54:00,812 --> 00:54:06,042
(They have to eat ice cream and sweet potatoes at minus 17°C.)

1301
00:54:07,542 --> 00:54:09,512
- Okay. - The first to whistle...

1302
00:54:09,612 --> 00:54:13,012
- Okay. - The first to whistle after...

1303
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:15,642
eating sweet potatoes and ice cream wins.

1304
00:54:16,342 --> 00:54:18,342
(They're fighting for food.)

1305
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:20,542
- Come on. - You eat this.

1306
00:54:20,542 --> 00:54:21,572
They must be hungry.

1307
00:54:21,572 --> 00:54:22,642
Wait a minute.

1308
00:54:22,642 --> 00:54:24,872
My teeth will hurt.

1309
00:54:25,212 --> 00:54:26,972
I'll eat the sweet potatoes.

1310
00:54:27,372 --> 00:54:30,012
- Get ready. - Get ready.

1311
00:54:30,342 --> 00:54:33,672
Get ready, set, go.

1312
00:54:33,672 --> 00:54:36,272
("Speedy Eating" starts.)

1313
00:54:37,512 --> 00:54:38,972
My goodness.

1314
00:54:39,872 --> 00:54:42,172
(They eat ice cream in the freezing cold.)

1315
00:54:42,172 --> 00:54:43,672
Kwang Soo.

1316
00:54:43,672 --> 00:54:47,042
(Their tongues get stuck to the ice cream.)

1317
00:54:48,672 --> 00:54:50,672
(Their mouths freeze.)

1318
00:54:51,072 --> 00:54:54,212
(Their mouths are filled with hot sweet potatoes.)

1319
00:54:55,742 --> 00:54:57,112
You can do it.

1320
00:54:57,112 --> 00:54:58,872
(Haha only scored one.)

1321
00:54:58,872 --> 00:55:03,242
(Haha is running out of time.)

1322
00:55:04,572 --> 00:55:06,372
(His nervousness makes him fail.)

1323
00:55:06,372 --> 00:55:07,742
Oh, no.

1324
00:55:07,742 --> 00:55:09,842
(When will he make 4 more?)

1325
00:55:09,842 --> 00:55:12,072
I can do it. I'm Michael Jordan.

1326
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,642
(He imagines himself to be Michael Jordan.)

1327
00:55:15,142 --> 00:55:20,072
(Michael Jordan made successful free throws with his eyes closed.)

1328
00:55:20,072 --> 00:55:22,972
(Please give strength to Haha.)

1329
00:55:22,972 --> 00:55:25,012
Feel the wind.

1330
00:55:26,542 --> 00:55:29,972
(We hope he makes it in the hoop.)

1331
00:55:30,472 --> 00:55:35,012
(Will he make it through the hoop despite the strong wind?)

1332
00:55:35,012 --> 00:55:37,242
I'll make it. I love you.

1333
00:55:37,742 --> 00:55:39,172
Welcome to Running Man.

1334
00:55:39,742 --> 00:55:42,042
"I've shot the ball 10 million times."

1335
00:55:44,012 --> 00:55:47,672
(Here he goes.)

1336
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:51,342
- You made it. - Okay.

1337
00:55:51,342 --> 00:55:52,372
(He scored 2.)

1338
00:55:52,372 --> 00:55:53,712
Let's do it again.

1339
00:55:54,242 --> 00:55:55,272
(Meanwhile)

1340
00:55:55,272 --> 00:55:56,312
We can do it.

1341
00:55:56,312 --> 00:55:57,842
(They experience two extreme temperatures.)

1342
00:55:57,842 --> 00:56:00,512
(Kwang Soo enjoys the ice cream.)

1343
00:56:00,512 --> 00:56:02,412
Do you want to switch?

1344
00:56:02,572 --> 00:56:05,172
No, I know you want to eat ice cream because you're thirsty.

1345
00:56:05,842 --> 00:56:08,272
Kwang Soo, scold him.

1346
00:56:08,272 --> 00:56:09,472
What are you doing?

1347
00:56:09,472 --> 00:56:11,442
- What? - Let me go.

1348
00:56:11,442 --> 00:56:12,942
I'm so thirsty.

1349
00:56:13,012 --> 00:56:15,042
- My throat is so dry. - Drink some water.

1350
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:17,272
- Give them water. - Where is it?

1351
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:21,212
(Here's some snow.)

1352
00:56:21,212 --> 00:56:22,212
What is that?

1353
00:56:22,272 --> 00:56:24,912
- Here's some water for you. - That's snow.

1354
00:56:25,172 --> 00:56:26,372
Stop.

1355
00:56:26,872 --> 00:56:29,572
(Kwang Soo whistles.)

1356
00:56:29,572 --> 00:56:31,372
- Kwang Soo made it. - Okay.

1357
00:56:31,772 --> 00:56:32,772
Hurry up.

1358
00:56:32,772 --> 00:56:36,572
(Once Jong Kook finishes eating, they move on to the next.)

1359
00:56:36,572 --> 00:56:39,042
Gosh, I'm cold.

1360
00:56:39,042 --> 00:56:41,572
(Who will finish eating first?)

1361
00:56:41,642 --> 00:56:43,112
- He did it. - He made it.

1362
00:56:44,142 --> 00:56:45,342
(Jong Kook whistles.)

1363
00:56:45,342 --> 00:56:47,612
- Okay. - Jong Kook and Kwang Soo win.

1364
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:49,242
(They move to the next game.)

1365
00:56:49,242 --> 00:56:51,212
We only have two games left.

1366
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:53,112
(They head to Ji Hyo.)

1367
00:56:53,112 --> 00:56:54,512
Haha, keep trying.

1368
00:56:54,742 --> 00:56:56,142
My goodness.

1369
00:56:57,672 --> 00:57:00,672
(Haha scored twice so far.)

1370
00:57:03,542 --> 00:57:05,942
- You made it. - Okay, this is good.

1371
00:57:05,942 --> 00:57:08,612
I'm coming to get you, Haha.

1372
00:57:09,712 --> 00:57:11,442
They're coming.

1373
00:57:12,612 --> 00:57:14,012
Hurry up.

1374
00:57:14,012 --> 00:57:16,212
(They're coming after Haha's name tag.)

1375
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:18,412
(Haha misses.)

1376
00:57:18,412 --> 00:57:19,442
Hurry.

1377
00:57:20,512 --> 00:57:23,172
Haha, you must hurry up.

1378
00:57:23,172 --> 00:57:25,042
- You must make it. - Keep trying, Haha.

1379
00:57:25,172 --> 00:57:26,972
- You must make it. - Keep trying, Haha.

1380
00:57:27,042 --> 00:57:28,172
Please.

1381
00:57:32,842 --> 00:57:34,812
(He scored 4 so far.)

1382
00:57:34,812 --> 00:57:36,272
Here's the last one.

1383
00:57:37,512 --> 00:57:39,112
Rock-paper-scissors.

1384
00:57:39,112 --> 00:57:40,342
(She must buy Haha time.)

1385
00:57:40,342 --> 00:57:41,672
Let's win.

1386
00:57:42,142 --> 00:57:46,572
(Jong Kook starts the game.)

1387
00:57:46,572 --> 00:57:51,312
(4 years ago, he was amazing at playing slap.)

1388
00:57:51,312 --> 00:57:55,812
(He won without breaking a sweat.)

1389
00:57:55,812 --> 00:57:58,042
(Here he goes again.)

1390
00:57:58,742 --> 00:57:59,912
It didn't flip.

1391
00:57:59,912 --> 00:58:01,242
(He fails.)

1392
00:58:01,242 --> 00:58:02,942
Hurry, Ji Hyo.

1393
00:58:03,942 --> 00:58:05,612
(It's Ji Hyo's turn.)

1394
00:58:06,272 --> 00:58:10,072
The slap will flip when you hit it right in the center.

1395
00:58:10,072 --> 00:58:12,042
(Ji Hyo even received a special lesson from her father.)

1396
00:58:12,742 --> 00:58:14,172
(Is it like this?)

1397
00:58:14,172 --> 00:58:15,842
You shouldn't do that.

1398
00:58:17,212 --> 00:58:18,212
Okay.

1399
00:58:18,312 --> 00:58:20,672
(He claps.)

1400
00:58:21,212 --> 00:58:22,972
- Is this mine? - Yes, hurry up.

1401
00:58:22,972 --> 00:58:24,572
The paper might tear.

1402
00:58:24,572 --> 00:58:26,612
(Ji Hyo is ready to show what she learned.)

1403
00:58:26,612 --> 00:58:31,272
(She'll show the power of education.)

1404
00:58:31,272 --> 00:58:34,912
(Jong Kook and Kwang Soo must play until they win.)

1405
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:37,972
(She fails to flip it.)

1406
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:40,172
- It's hard because it's slippery. - It doesn't flip easily.

1407
00:58:40,172 --> 00:58:41,512
You can do it!

1408
00:58:42,712 --> 00:58:47,772
(Jong Kook and Kwang Soo are getting closer to Haha.)

1409
00:58:47,772 --> 00:58:48,842
Did I make it?

1410
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:52,342
(He shot from a good angle but failed.)

1411
00:58:52,342 --> 00:58:55,542
(Just one more)

1412
00:58:55,672 --> 00:58:56,812
It bounced off.

1413
00:58:59,712 --> 00:59:00,912
What?

1414
00:59:02,542 --> 00:59:04,242
This is driving me crazy.

1415
00:59:04,512 --> 00:59:05,942
Hurry up.

1416
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:07,942
(It's Jong Kook's turn again.)

1417
00:59:07,942 --> 00:59:11,372
(I'll flip it this time.)

1418
00:59:13,512 --> 00:59:14,712
Hey.

1419
00:59:15,142 --> 00:59:18,412
(He ruins his team's chances.)

1420
00:59:18,412 --> 00:59:20,142
I'm sorry.

1421
00:59:20,142 --> 00:59:21,372
(It's the ice.)

1422
00:59:21,372 --> 00:59:22,842
Hurry up.

1423
00:59:22,842 --> 00:59:25,542
(It's Ji Hyo's turn again.)

1424
00:59:25,542 --> 00:59:27,542
Let's go, Ji Hyo.

1425
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:29,272
This won't flip.

1426
00:59:29,272 --> 00:59:31,172
(She fails.)

1427
00:59:31,172 --> 00:59:32,312
Hurry.

1428
00:59:32,312 --> 00:59:37,012
(They have to rely on Haha's shooting ability.)

1429
00:59:37,572 --> 00:59:38,572
Fail.

1430
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,842
(Is it Haha's shooting ability...)

1431
00:59:41,842 --> 00:59:44,912
(or Jong Kook's fingertips?)

1432
00:59:45,742 --> 00:59:49,172
(If Jong Kook manages to flip, Haha's name tag will be in reach.)

1433
00:59:52,742 --> 00:59:53,772
It flipped.

1434
00:59:54,372 --> 00:59:55,772
- It flipped. - I did it.

1435
00:59:56,412 --> 00:59:59,372
(He's successful.)

1436
00:59:59,372 --> 01:00:01,142
- I sacrificed myself. - I did it.

1437
01:00:01,142 --> 01:00:03,142
- I did it. - It worked.

1438
01:00:03,142 --> 01:00:04,212
(Jong Kook and Kwang Soo clear all the missions.)

1439
01:00:04,212 --> 01:00:06,072
Hey, Haha.

1440
01:00:06,072 --> 01:00:07,942
(There's only Haha's name tag left.)

1441
01:00:08,372 --> 01:00:10,212
- You're done. - Haha.

1442
01:00:10,412 --> 01:00:12,742
(I can hear him approaching.)

1443
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:15,272
- Hurry. - This is cold.

1444
01:00:15,272 --> 01:00:16,542
(We're coming for you.)

1445
01:00:16,542 --> 01:00:18,572
- Hurry and get it in! - Haha.

1446
01:00:18,572 --> 01:00:20,942
It didn't go in. Use more force.

1447
01:00:20,942 --> 01:00:22,012
I'm scared.

1448
01:00:22,012 --> 01:00:23,042
(He just needs to get one in.)

1449
01:00:24,742 --> 01:00:27,312
(Here it goes.)

1450
01:00:27,312 --> 01:00:31,372
(It's Haha's last shot.)

1451
01:00:31,372 --> 01:00:36,572
(Is it in or out?)

1452
01:00:36,572 --> 01:00:37,572
Fail.

1453
01:00:37,572 --> 01:00:38,872
(He fails again.)

1454
01:00:38,872 --> 01:00:40,172
Can I rip his name tag?

1455
01:00:40,472 --> 01:00:42,872
I ripped it.

1456
01:00:43,542 --> 01:00:44,972
(Jong Kook and Kwang Soo take the win.)

1457
01:00:44,972 --> 01:00:47,272
Why couldn't you get that in?

1458
01:00:47,272 --> 01:00:49,312
- You're done. - How many did you get?

1459
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,772
You're done.

1460
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,372
(You humiliated us.)

1461
01:00:52,372 --> 01:00:54,172
- You're done. - My goodness.

1462
01:00:54,172 --> 01:00:56,872
- This is totally frozen. - You're done.

1463
01:00:56,872 --> 01:00:58,472
(Haha's mission fails.)

1464
01:00:58,472 --> 01:01:01,542
Haha, you have failed the ultimate mission.

1465
01:01:01,672 --> 01:01:04,272
- You have failed... - What goes around comes around.

1466
01:01:04,272 --> 01:01:06,372
- You did well. - What goes around comes around.

1467
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:10,542
Haha and the three members you rescued...

1468
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:11,772
will all receive punishment.

1469
01:01:11,772 --> 01:01:12,842
Yes!

1470
01:01:12,842 --> 01:01:15,672
We'll go back to the bungee-jumping location.

1471
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,272
My goodness.

1472
01:01:17,272 --> 01:01:19,742
(They will go bungee jumping.)

1473
01:01:19,742 --> 01:01:21,672
We'll head to our last location.

1474
01:01:21,672 --> 01:01:23,942
- Don't joke around. - Will they all be doing it?

1475
01:01:23,942 --> 01:01:24,972
(Let's go for bungee jumping.)

1476
01:01:26,072 --> 01:01:28,042
(Location of the punishment)

1477
01:01:29,312 --> 01:01:31,842
(It was filled with Jae Seok's cries before.)

1478
01:01:31,842 --> 01:01:33,942
The fifth Member's Week,

1479
01:01:33,942 --> 01:01:37,242
Haha's I've Made My Decision race.

1480
01:01:37,542 --> 01:01:39,872
There's only one decision left.

1481
01:01:40,042 --> 01:01:41,312
He has to choose again?

1482
01:01:41,312 --> 01:01:42,312
It's rather...

1483
01:01:42,312 --> 01:01:45,972
he'll live or not. That is the question.

1484
01:01:46,872 --> 01:01:49,972
If Haha chooses to take the punishment himself,

1485
01:01:50,172 --> 01:01:53,642
the rest of the members will be exempted.

1486
01:01:53,642 --> 01:01:56,312
(If Haha takes the punishment, the others will be exempted.)

1487
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:58,942
If Haha decides not to take the punishment,

1488
01:01:59,012 --> 01:02:02,172
the three of you will be punished.

1489
01:02:02,912 --> 01:02:04,672
If you cannot decide within five minutes,

1490
01:02:04,672 --> 01:02:06,642
- all four of you... - Yes.

1491
01:02:06,642 --> 01:02:09,442
Will have to bungee jump.

1492
01:02:09,472 --> 01:02:11,412
(Will Haha live...)

1493
01:02:11,412 --> 01:02:13,172
(or will the other 3 live?)

1494
01:02:13,712 --> 01:02:16,012
How are we all supposed to bungee jump?

1495
01:02:16,012 --> 01:02:17,212
You can try it.

1496
01:02:17,212 --> 01:02:18,242
(This is complicating.)

1497
01:02:18,242 --> 01:02:19,972
- My goodness. - Come here for a second.

1498
01:02:19,972 --> 01:02:21,072
(This is the cruelest decision of the day.)

1499
01:02:21,072 --> 01:02:23,672
The thing that scares me the most...

1500
01:02:23,672 --> 01:02:26,172
is that Haha is not making eye contact.

1501
01:02:26,172 --> 01:02:28,272
It means he already made up his mind.

1502
01:02:28,472 --> 01:02:31,542
(I didn't know my decisions would affect me this way.)

1503
01:02:33,312 --> 01:02:36,172
(Their fates are entirely upon Haha.)

1504
01:02:36,842 --> 01:02:37,842
What would you do?

1505
01:02:37,842 --> 01:02:39,372
You can't do this.

1506
01:02:39,372 --> 01:02:41,012
- If it was me, - I'm not sure.

1507
01:02:41,112 --> 01:02:43,012
I would take the punishment.

1508
01:02:43,072 --> 01:02:44,672
- If it was me. - Haha, if it was me,

1509
01:02:44,912 --> 01:02:48,042
- I would do that. - But you are different.

1510
01:02:48,042 --> 01:02:50,012
We have our own way of living, right?

1511
01:02:50,012 --> 01:02:51,972
- Exactly. - Of course.

1512
01:02:52,312 --> 01:02:55,412
Did you put your ear muffs on so that you don't have to listen?

1513
01:02:55,572 --> 01:02:57,742
(He ignores Seok Jin.)

1514
01:02:58,142 --> 01:02:59,912
What would you do, Jae Seok,

1515
01:02:59,912 --> 01:03:03,012
if you had to make this decision?

1516
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:04,012
You must choose.

1517
01:03:04,012 --> 01:03:05,572
I have no choice.

1518
01:03:05,572 --> 01:03:07,412
- Jae Seok will jump. - He will.

1519
01:03:07,412 --> 01:03:09,412
- That's what I would do. - To be honest...

1520
01:03:09,412 --> 01:03:12,112
- You can do what you think. - He wouldn't have been happy.

1521
01:03:12,142 --> 01:03:15,372
Don't think too much, Haha.

1522
01:03:15,372 --> 01:03:18,372
It's all right. This is a variety show.

1523
01:03:18,372 --> 01:03:21,142
- Don't worry, Haha. - You look scary right now.

1524
01:03:21,142 --> 01:03:23,272
(Do you think you won't worry?)

1525
01:03:25,272 --> 01:03:27,312
(Get away from me. I want to be alone.)

1526
01:03:27,312 --> 01:03:29,742
What am I supposed to do? How do I jump?

1527
01:03:30,542 --> 01:03:33,572
I can't do this for my life. How am I supposed to jump?

1528
01:03:33,972 --> 01:03:36,412
He's never done bungee jumping before.

1529
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:37,572
Try it, Haha.

1530
01:03:37,572 --> 01:03:39,312
He failed to do it on "Infinite Challenge".

1531
01:03:39,312 --> 01:03:42,112
(Why are they doing this to me?)

1532
01:03:43,372 --> 01:03:46,912
(All I did today was make decisions.)

1533
01:03:47,542 --> 01:03:50,272
(His indecisiveness should have gotten better by now.)

1534
01:03:50,872 --> 01:03:54,642
(He didn't expect he'd have to do this.)

1535
01:03:55,372 --> 01:03:56,542
(Can I cry?)

1536
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:58,172
What do I do?

1537
01:03:58,942 --> 01:04:00,172
What should I do?

1538
01:04:00,372 --> 01:04:01,372
10...

1539
01:04:01,372 --> 01:04:03,372
(Haha has tried bungee jumping before but was never successful.)

1540
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:05,772
- Nine, eight, - What now?

1541
01:04:06,072 --> 01:04:08,712
- seven, six, - This is too cruel.

1542
01:04:09,272 --> 01:04:10,572
- five... - five...

1543
01:04:10,572 --> 01:04:13,372
(Make a decision for us, Haha.)

1544
01:04:14,372 --> 01:04:15,472
- two... - two...

1545
01:04:15,472 --> 01:04:16,472
(He's desperate.)

1546
01:04:16,472 --> 01:04:18,572
- One. - What is your decision?

1547
01:04:18,572 --> 01:04:19,572
(He looks determined.)

1548
01:04:20,672 --> 01:04:21,912
What is your decision?

1549
01:04:21,912 --> 01:04:25,872
(Will he die or live by himself?)

1550
01:04:25,872 --> 01:04:27,212
We'll all jump.

1551
01:04:27,212 --> 01:04:29,742
(We'll all jump.)

1552
01:04:30,572 --> 01:04:32,772
- What did he say? - He wants all of us to jump.

1553
01:04:32,772 --> 01:04:35,272
(It'll be a good memory.)

1554
01:04:35,272 --> 01:04:36,542
Let's do it together.

1555
01:04:36,542 --> 01:04:38,872
Hey. Don't do that.

1556
01:04:38,872 --> 01:04:41,642
From his face, I thought he was going to jump by himself.

1557
01:04:41,642 --> 01:04:44,272
- But I knew. - I thought he was going to jump.

1558
01:04:44,272 --> 01:04:46,842
- I knew. I saw it coming. - What was that face for?

1559
01:04:46,842 --> 01:04:49,312
Why did you have a determined look?

1560
01:04:49,312 --> 01:04:51,142
- Even Seok Jin... - I can't jump by myself.

1561
01:04:51,142 --> 01:04:53,942
- Bungee jumping is hard. - I was...

1562
01:04:53,942 --> 01:04:55,572
just joking. I just...

1563
01:04:56,742 --> 01:04:58,172
(He can't seem to talk.)

1564
01:04:58,172 --> 01:05:00,012
I can't say it.

1565
01:05:01,072 --> 01:05:04,542
(You can put yourself at ease and just save us.)

1566
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:07,572
The sun's going down.

1567
01:05:07,572 --> 01:05:08,642
(The sun can't wait no longer.)

1568
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:11,912
I should've chosen a blind date.

1569
01:05:12,212 --> 01:05:13,842
(Blind dates are difficult too.)

1570
01:05:14,372 --> 01:05:16,972
(It's time to make a decision.)

1571
01:05:18,472 --> 01:05:20,172
(Every Member's Week up to now had a happy ending.)

1572
01:05:21,372 --> 01:05:26,272
(Everybody suffered in the freezing cold during Haha's Week.)

1573
01:05:26,312 --> 01:05:30,172
(End our suffering, Haha.)

1574
01:05:30,742 --> 01:05:35,112
(This is all because I'm too indecisive.)

1575
01:05:36,542 --> 01:05:38,042
I'll jump by myself.

1576
01:05:38,912 --> 01:05:42,172
(He finally decides to jump by himself.)

1577
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:43,172
Really?

1578
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:44,542
(He's about to tear up.)

1579
01:05:46,112 --> 01:05:47,572
Are you crying?

1580
01:05:48,172 --> 01:05:50,112
(I usually don't cry but I'm right now.)

1581
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:52,642
What's wrong?

1582
01:05:52,772 --> 01:05:55,012
- He's getting teary-eyed - Is he crying?

1583
01:05:55,012 --> 01:05:57,672
- It's okay. - Haha.

1584
01:05:57,672 --> 01:05:58,672
(He can't talk.)

1585
01:05:59,642 --> 01:06:00,912
Are you crying?

1586
01:06:00,912 --> 01:06:02,012
(Are you really crying over bungee jumping?)

1587
01:06:02,012 --> 01:06:04,942
- Are you really crying? - He's actually crying.

1588
01:06:05,212 --> 01:06:06,542
(Haven't you seen someone cry?)

1589
01:06:06,542 --> 01:06:08,572
Haha.

1590
01:06:09,172 --> 01:06:11,412
He doesn't have to cry.

1591
01:06:11,412 --> 01:06:12,772
- Be quiet. - He's never done it before.

1592
01:06:12,772 --> 01:06:14,542
- Don't say that. - Excuse me.

1593
01:06:14,542 --> 01:06:16,872
I have a fear of heights but he's worse.

1594
01:06:17,742 --> 01:06:20,212
(Smile so that your tears won't fall.)

1595
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:25,472
I really can't do this.

1596
01:06:25,472 --> 01:06:27,472
I'm sorry. I can't.

1597
01:06:27,642 --> 01:06:29,972
(Haha chose the impossible for the members.)

1598
01:06:30,972 --> 01:06:34,872
(Would he get down safely?)

1599
01:06:34,872 --> 01:06:37,612
Do we have to end a variety show...

1600
01:06:37,742 --> 01:06:40,512
this sad?

1601
01:06:41,172 --> 01:06:42,742
We feel bad.

1602
01:06:42,942 --> 01:06:44,172
Haha.

1603
01:06:44,972 --> 01:06:46,172
I'm sorry.

1604
01:06:46,212 --> 01:06:48,372
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

1605
01:06:48,372 --> 01:06:49,542
(They're all together in spirit.)

1606
01:06:49,542 --> 01:06:52,012
- I'm sorry. - Thank you. I'm more thankful.

1607
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:54,472
- Thank you. - I can feel your heart.

1608
01:06:54,572 --> 01:06:57,612
You're doing it for us.

1609
01:06:57,742 --> 01:06:59,142
Thank you.

1610
01:06:59,142 --> 01:07:01,172
(Thanks for your decision, Haha.)

1611
01:07:02,212 --> 01:07:03,272
It's cold.

1612
01:07:03,272 --> 01:07:04,472
(Haha gets on the elevator by himself.)

1613
01:07:04,472 --> 01:07:06,472
It's cold.

1614
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:11,712
- Please put on the equipment. - Yes.

1615
01:07:14,012 --> 01:07:16,572
(As soon as he gets on, the elevator speeds up.)

1616
01:07:16,572 --> 01:07:17,842
What should I do?

1617
01:07:17,842 --> 01:07:20,272
He puts the equipment on first.

1618
01:07:20,272 --> 01:07:21,972
(They cheer him on.)

1619
01:07:21,972 --> 01:07:23,472
He has the rope fastened.

1620
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:25,572
- I'm scared looking at the rope. - How is he going to do it?

1621
01:07:25,572 --> 01:07:27,812
The rope scares me too.

1622
01:07:28,972 --> 01:07:30,012
(Bouncing)

1623
01:07:30,912 --> 01:07:34,272
(Even the smallest wind makes the elevator shake.)

1624
01:07:34,272 --> 01:07:37,672
(He must endure it on his own.)

1625
01:07:38,542 --> 01:07:42,012
(He never even dreamed of being this high.)

1626
01:07:43,042 --> 01:07:45,542
(He chose to jump from 63m for the members.)

1627
01:07:45,542 --> 01:07:49,612
This is killing me. What do I do now?

1628
01:07:49,672 --> 01:07:51,212
He's going all the way up.

1629
01:07:51,212 --> 01:07:52,642
All the way there?

1630
01:07:52,672 --> 01:07:55,372
- My goodness. - The elevator went all the way.

1631
01:07:55,372 --> 01:07:57,272
(He ascends very quickly.)

1632
01:07:57,272 --> 01:07:58,742
I can hear him yelling.

1633
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:00,642
- What now? - It's too high.

1634
01:08:00,642 --> 01:08:03,312
- I can't watch. - Let's go, Haha.

1635
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:05,112
Don't say that.

1636
01:08:05,112 --> 01:08:07,772
I want to say something for him.

1637
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:11,742
(His eyes are shut.)

1638
01:08:13,272 --> 01:08:15,842
(He keeps repeating himself.)

1639
01:08:16,872 --> 01:08:21,242
(He didn't know his indecisiveness would lead him here.)

1640
01:08:22,372 --> 01:08:25,012
(He keeps climbing higher...)

1641
01:08:25,012 --> 01:08:27,742
(and higher.)

1642
01:08:27,742 --> 01:08:30,942
(He finally stops at 63m.)

1643
01:08:34,272 --> 01:08:36,412
This is driving me crazy.

1644
01:08:37,582 --> 01:08:40,842
(He puts a safety harness on.)

1645
01:08:42,172 --> 01:08:47,242
(He's both desperate and fearful.)

1646
01:08:48,672 --> 01:08:55,642
(The final punishment is held at 63m above ground.)

1647
01:08:57,212 --> 01:08:59,742
- You can do it, Haha. - I love you!

1648
01:09:00,212 --> 01:09:02,542
- I can relate. - I love you.

1649
01:09:02,542 --> 01:09:03,972
Thank you, Haha.

1650
01:09:03,972 --> 01:09:05,972
- I was there, too. - He's standing, right?

1651
01:09:06,512 --> 01:09:07,872
Oh, gosh.

1652
01:09:09,372 --> 01:09:11,342
I'm dying up here.

1653
01:09:12,012 --> 01:09:14,612
I can't even root for him. I know that feeling.

1654
01:09:14,812 --> 01:09:15,972
He gets scared easily.

1655
01:09:17,472 --> 01:09:18,712
Please stand in front of the door.

1656
01:09:18,712 --> 01:09:20,042
You will jump after 10 seconds.

1657
01:09:21,342 --> 01:09:22,412
(Only 10 seconds remain until the jump.)

1658
01:09:22,412 --> 01:09:23,912
Haha, please untie it.

1659
01:09:24,212 --> 01:09:26,242
After 10 seconds, you will jump.

1660
01:09:26,372 --> 01:09:28,582
- My gosh. - You can get ready now.

1661
01:09:28,642 --> 01:09:29,642
I don't think I can do this.

1662
01:09:31,582 --> 01:09:32,582
I can't even look at it.

1663
01:09:32,582 --> 01:09:34,872
(I have to stand here, relying on a single string.)

1664
01:09:35,842 --> 01:09:38,042
(He's teary.)

1665
01:09:38,212 --> 01:09:40,112
You will jump after 10 seconds.

1666
01:09:40,112 --> 01:09:41,412
(It's time to face his extreme fear.)

1667
01:09:41,412 --> 01:09:42,542
Ten.

1668
01:09:42,542 --> 01:09:44,212
- Hold on. - Nine.

1669
01:09:44,712 --> 01:09:46,542
- I can't do this. - Eight.

1670
01:09:46,742 --> 01:09:48,412
- Wait. - Seven.

1671
01:09:48,412 --> 01:09:50,512
- No way. - Six.

1672
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:52,872
Five.

1673
01:09:53,712 --> 01:09:55,512
- Four. - No, I can't do this.

1674
01:09:55,772 --> 01:09:56,772
Three.

1675
01:09:57,082 --> 01:09:59,582
Gosh. I wouldn't be able to do it.

1676
01:09:59,772 --> 01:10:01,342
You can do it, Haha!

1677
01:10:01,672 --> 01:10:04,212
- You can do it, Haha! - He can't even talk to someone.

1678
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:06,472
Two.

1679
01:10:06,472 --> 01:10:09,342
(There are 2 seconds left before the jump.)

1680
01:10:09,342 --> 01:10:10,372
One.

1681
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:11,942
(1 second before the jump)

1682
01:10:11,972 --> 01:10:14,472
(It's time to jump.)

1683
01:10:14,472 --> 01:10:16,112
Before you jump,

1684
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:19,272
(Before you jump...)

1685
01:10:19,412 --> 01:10:20,472
Wait.

1686
01:10:20,472 --> 01:10:22,942
(His legs give way.)

1687
01:10:24,042 --> 01:10:26,582
(What? Why? What's happening now?)

1688
01:10:26,812 --> 01:10:29,412
Do you see that door over there?

1689
01:10:29,842 --> 01:10:31,372
Can you open the door?

1690
01:10:32,512 --> 01:10:37,342
(Why did you ask me to open the door 1 second before the jump?)

1691
01:10:39,082 --> 01:10:44,042
(What is behind this door?)

1692
01:10:44,612 --> 01:10:45,742
What is this?

1693
01:10:47,012 --> 01:10:50,412
(What is waiting for Haha behind the door?)

1694
01:10:54,312 --> 01:10:57,472
(It's a diaper-shaped cake and an unidentified video.)

1695
01:10:58,742 --> 01:11:01,712
(He plays it not knowing what's happening.)

1696
01:11:07,082 --> 01:11:09,112
Haha, were you surprised?

1697
01:11:09,142 --> 01:11:11,472
We know you have an extreme fear of heights.

1698
01:11:11,472 --> 01:11:14,612
- It must've been hard. - It must have been difficult...

1699
01:11:14,712 --> 01:11:16,242
for you to come up here.

1700
01:11:16,742 --> 01:11:20,772
(Hold on. What is this?)

1701
01:11:21,872 --> 01:11:25,012
It's absolutely for you.

1702
01:11:25,172 --> 01:11:26,972
We are not doing this to avenge ourselves on you.

1703
01:11:27,272 --> 01:11:29,442
It's to congratulate you about your second child.

1704
01:11:29,442 --> 01:11:32,772
We made this in order to celebrate for So Wool, your second child.

1705
01:11:32,772 --> 01:11:34,542
(It's to celebrate for So Wool, his second child.)

1706
01:11:35,042 --> 01:11:37,312
(So this is a surprise party?)

1707
01:11:37,842 --> 01:11:41,712
The most important thing is that I hope there is a twist.

1708
01:11:42,272 --> 01:11:43,772
There has to be a twist.

1709
01:11:43,772 --> 01:11:45,242
(Haha dreamed of a week with a twist.)

1710
01:11:45,412 --> 01:11:47,582
(That's why we've prepared this.)

1711
01:11:47,582 --> 01:11:52,972
Jong Kook and Kwang Soo. You were informed you came to avenge Haha,

1712
01:11:53,112 --> 01:11:57,872
but you've been assigned with a task to help with Haha's party.

1713
01:11:57,972 --> 01:11:59,972
- You brought the gift, right? - We have to throw him a party?

1714
01:12:00,242 --> 01:12:02,582
- A surprise party? - Yes.

1715
01:12:02,582 --> 01:12:04,712
(This is why they told us to prepare a gift.)

1716
01:12:05,582 --> 01:12:07,042
- We are supposed to avenge him. - Right.

1717
01:12:07,042 --> 01:12:08,312
- But it's not it. - It's not it.

1718
01:12:08,312 --> 01:12:12,772
- It's not? - We must do a surprise event.

1719
01:12:12,872 --> 01:12:14,972
- I have to lose? - When you do your mission...

1720
01:12:14,972 --> 01:12:16,112
I will play rock, paper, and scissors respectively.

1721
01:12:16,112 --> 01:12:17,342
(They managed to persuade him.)

1722
01:12:17,912 --> 01:12:21,512
(Of course, they won consecutively.)

1723
01:12:21,612 --> 01:12:22,672
That's it, right?

1724
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:24,242
(Haha, are you watching?)

1725
01:12:24,742 --> 01:12:26,842
- You have to lose, too. - Of course.

1726
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:28,642
(They convinced him to eat slowly.)

1727
01:12:28,642 --> 01:12:32,772
(They quickly passed through the second gateway.)

1728
01:12:33,042 --> 01:12:34,212
Please lose. We have to throw a surprise party.

1729
01:12:34,212 --> 01:12:35,742
We are throwing him a surprise party.

1730
01:12:35,742 --> 01:12:37,372
(They convinced Ji Hyo in "Icy Slap-Match".)

1731
01:12:37,372 --> 01:12:39,872
(Their fake revenge was successful.)

1732
01:12:41,312 --> 01:12:44,412
(They easily removed Haha's name tag.)

1733
01:12:44,412 --> 01:12:47,742
(They managed to escort him to the platform.)

1734
01:12:49,042 --> 01:12:52,472
(It's a story only Haha wasn't aware of.)

1735
01:12:52,942 --> 01:12:54,972
Overcome this fear.

1736
01:12:55,442 --> 01:12:58,012
I hope you will become a cool father.

1737
01:12:58,612 --> 01:13:03,242
(The elevator slowly starts to come down.)

1738
01:13:03,242 --> 01:13:04,372
What is this?

1739
01:13:05,212 --> 01:13:07,872
(He's relieved and grateful.)

1740
01:13:07,872 --> 01:13:09,742
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1741
01:13:09,742 --> 01:13:11,312
- Congratulations. - I'm so happy for you.

1742
01:13:11,312 --> 01:13:12,742
Congratulations, Go Eun.

1743
01:13:12,742 --> 01:13:15,012
- Congratulations. - I'm so jealous.

1744
01:13:15,012 --> 01:13:18,342
- Congratulations. - I hope the child is healthy.

1745
01:13:18,442 --> 01:13:23,112
I hope your family will be happy and So Wool will grow up to be bright.

1746
01:13:23,172 --> 01:13:24,742
- So Wool. - I love you, Haha.

1747
01:13:24,742 --> 01:13:26,112
- You can do it. - You can do it.

1748
01:13:26,112 --> 01:13:27,472
So Wool, be healthy.

1749
01:13:27,472 --> 01:13:29,372
So Wool, be brave.

1750
01:13:29,442 --> 01:13:30,472
(We'll see you soon, So Wool.)

1751
01:13:32,212 --> 01:13:33,372
This must have surprised you a lot.

1752
01:13:33,372 --> 01:13:36,172
(He got comfort and a present in a moment of an extreme situation.)

1753
01:13:37,842 --> 01:13:42,542
(He's about to cry. Tears are filling in.)

1754
01:13:42,542 --> 01:13:43,812
I could've jumped.

1755
01:13:45,372 --> 01:13:46,672
Gosh.

1756
01:13:47,612 --> 01:13:51,042
(He lets out a laughter as he feels embarrassed.)

1757
01:13:51,672 --> 01:13:53,412
(I'm sorry I can't make decisions.)

1758
01:13:53,412 --> 01:13:55,582
Why don't you go and meet the members?

1759
01:13:55,582 --> 01:13:57,412
(Thank you.)

1760
01:13:58,012 --> 01:13:59,612
(The mission of Haha's week is over.)

1761
01:13:59,612 --> 01:14:00,872
Thank you.

1762
01:14:02,242 --> 01:14:03,612
- Haha. - Haha!

1763
01:14:03,612 --> 01:14:05,472
- Haha. - Haha, come here quickly.

1764
01:14:05,472 --> 01:14:07,872
- Haha. - Congratulations, Haha.

1765
01:14:08,672 --> 01:14:10,612
(Were you surprised?)

1766
01:14:11,172 --> 01:14:15,582
(Stop teasing me. If you keep at it, I will feel more embarrassed.)

1767
01:14:15,582 --> 01:14:17,412
- Where are you going? - Are you embarrassed?

1768
01:14:18,042 --> 01:14:19,772
- Come back. - Are you embarrassed?

1769
01:14:20,272 --> 01:14:21,642
- Gosh. - Are you embarrassed?

1770
01:14:23,342 --> 01:14:26,042
What would have happened if you told us to jump?

1771
01:14:26,582 --> 01:14:27,872
I was only joking.

1772
01:14:27,872 --> 01:14:30,742
- This is embarrassing. Thank you. - Did you cry?

1773
01:14:31,112 --> 01:14:33,312
- We even bought presents. - Thank you.

1774
01:14:33,312 --> 01:14:35,212
This is the present from us. That is from the staff.

1775
01:14:35,212 --> 01:14:36,672
- Here they are. - Thank you.

1776
01:14:37,472 --> 01:14:39,582
- Eat this at home. - Please do.

1777
01:14:39,582 --> 01:14:42,912
The members have prepared gifts for Haha...

1778
01:14:43,012 --> 01:14:48,212
and his second child who will be born soon.

1779
01:14:48,212 --> 01:14:49,272
- It's So Wool. - Right. So Wool.

1780
01:14:49,272 --> 01:14:50,842
- For So Wool. - Yes.

1781
01:14:50,842 --> 01:14:52,512
Why don't we give him a round of applause?

1782
01:14:52,512 --> 01:14:54,512
(Congratulations on the birth of his new family member.)

1783
01:14:54,512 --> 01:14:56,112
We bought it last night...

1784
01:14:56,112 --> 01:14:57,512
- at a department store. - Really? Thank you.

1785
01:14:57,672 --> 01:14:59,012
Goodness.

1786
01:14:59,342 --> 01:15:02,582
I had no idea you prepared a surprise event like this.

1787
01:15:03,112 --> 01:15:04,642
I think all of us should stay together forever.

1788
01:15:04,642 --> 01:15:06,272
(He's crazy about the members.)

1789
01:15:06,272 --> 01:15:07,612
We are the one.

1790
01:15:07,612 --> 01:15:09,542
- Thank you so much. - Our pleasure.

1791
01:15:09,642 --> 01:15:12,672
I hope we can grow old together.

1792
01:15:12,672 --> 01:15:14,442
- It's touching. - I hope we can smile along the way.

1793
01:15:14,442 --> 01:15:15,582
- I hope so, too. - Thank you.

1794
01:15:15,582 --> 01:15:17,512
- Anyway, Haha... - Thank you.

1795
01:15:17,512 --> 01:15:20,412
- Haha. - We also thank you.

1796
01:15:20,412 --> 01:15:23,242
- I hope So Wool will be healthy. - This is embarrassing.

1797
01:15:23,242 --> 01:15:26,042
- I hope she grows up healthy. - She will grow up to be happy.

1798
01:15:26,242 --> 01:15:29,172
Go Eun, it's a difficult time for you since you are almost due.

1799
01:15:29,582 --> 01:15:33,642
Hang in there a bit more. Let's deliver the baby safely.

1800
01:15:33,742 --> 01:15:36,742
I love you, So Wool and I hope you will be born healthy.

1801
01:15:36,742 --> 01:15:37,942
I love you, my family.

1802
01:15:38,472 --> 01:15:39,772
I love you too, Go Eun.

1803
01:15:39,772 --> 01:15:41,172
(We will always root for Haha's decision.)

1804
01:15:41,172 --> 01:15:43,342
- It's so touching. - My goodness.

1805
01:15:43,712 --> 01:15:45,712
This is Running Man's Member's Week.

1806
01:15:46,242 --> 01:15:47,742
(It's the 6th week.)

1807
01:15:47,742 --> 01:15:48,912
(Ji Hyo, Jong Kook)

1808
01:15:48,912 --> 01:15:50,012
(Seok Jin, Gary)

1809
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:51,042
(Then Haha)

1810
01:15:51,042 --> 01:15:52,772
(Who are the 6th and 7th hosts?)

1811
01:15:52,772 --> 01:15:55,842
(It's a special gift from the staff for the members who worked hard.)

1812
01:15:55,842 --> 01:15:59,712
(It will be revealed on next Sunday.)
