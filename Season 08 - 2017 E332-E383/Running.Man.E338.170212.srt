1
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,410
This is Running Man's Member's Week.

2
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:09,210
(Week 6)

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,810
(It's a week of rest.)

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,540
(It's a paradise in the city. The paradise welcomes the members.)

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,110
(It's a marvelous break that they haven't had for a long time.)

6
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,270
(While you are asleep,)

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,340
(they start executing their mission.)

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,370
(He's a very suspicious clothes thief.)

9
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,370
(Yu Jae Seok against Lee Kwang Soo)

10
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,310
(The robbery in the sauna occurs in Seoul.)

11
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,940
(It's a neck and neck match between two thieves.)

12
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,340
(If you commit a burglary, you must pay for your crime.)

13
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,640
(The dragnet is closing in on the thieves.)

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,180
(It's a race between the hunter and the hunted.)

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,180
(What will these two thieves' fate be?)

16
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,370
(Taking a rest is a hard thing to do in the midst of a busy life.)

17
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:49,110
(Sauna is a vacation spot in the city where one can visit easily.)

18
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,540
We are at a sauna.

19
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,910
- You're right. - It's been so long.

20
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,940
You've been participating in Member's Week so far.

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,210
You must've been tired visiting...

22
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,670
- cold places. - Yes, it was so cold.

23
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,110
We prepared a break for you since you are...

24
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,010
physically and mentally exhausted.

25
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,310
- Is that so? - Really?

26
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,270
The race is called Walk, Don't Run.

27
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,040
We have prepared a race called Walk, Don't Run.

28
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,740
In order to start resting,

29
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,840
please get changed and gather here again.

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,140
- They're going to give us clothes? - All right!

31
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,110
(We are going to change right away?)

32
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,370
- Let's film a bit more. - Hey.

33
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,110
- Then why did we have to dress up? - What is this?

34
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,170
My stylist went to six different places for this outfit.

35
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,110
- Let's film a bit longer. - My stylist visited six places.

36
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,810
- Look at Kwang Soo. - What is your outfit?

37
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,640
- Who wears a long coat to a sauna? - It's not a long coat.

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,670
- We can play a game about it. - Look at Ji Hyo's jacket.

39
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,540
- You'd see this on a fashion show. - Hey.

40
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,840
I dressed up nicely today.

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,540
(Her arms catch everyone's eyes.)

42
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,240
- Let's go. - What?

43
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,470
- Let's go. - Okay. We should.

44
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,310
(Is this it?)

45
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,670
(Our runway has just started.)

46
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,410
(It's a complete outfit in a sauna that you've been dreaming of.)

47
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,640
(If it could make us stylish even for just 1 second...)

48
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,940
(She attracts attention.)

49
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,210
- That's not very ladylike. - What's wrong with it?

50
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,440
- What kind of lady would do that? - The arms are the highlight.

51
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,570
- Try this one. - The arms are the selling point.

52
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,470
(I will be fine if I can show off my fur.)

53
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,110
I'd like to apologize to my stylist.

54
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,370
- I'm sorry. - Let's wear it again.

55
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,010
- You should've told us before. - What a waste.

56
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,540
(Everyone goes to get changed.)

57
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,840
The number is 283.

58
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,670
Mine is 171.

59
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,310
What are you doing? How far are you going to follow me?

60
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,840
You're going to keep filming?

61
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,140
Fine. Film us. It's fine by me.

62
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,470
(They're filming us up close today.)

63
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,140
Is there a mission? What if someone starts removing the name tags?

64
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,810
(You're filming this, too?)

65
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,340
(Uncomfortable Sauna)

66
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,170
(What is this?)

67
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,640
(A mission card is in Kwang Soo's locker.)

68
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,170
(You are the thieves of the sauna. Steal others' clothes in secret.)

69
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,810
(Whoever steals more clothes wins.)

70
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,170
(Jae Seok and I are clothes thieves?)

71
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,810
(What?)

72
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,140
(The same mission card is in Jae Seok's locker.)

73
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,210
What is this?

74
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,840
(A hidden mission has been sent.)

75
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,910
What is all this now? My gosh. I'll go crazy.

76
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,540
(It's a mission called "Steal Their Clothes".)

77
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,640
How could I steal their clothes?

78
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,110
(If they steal 4 members' clothes, the mission is a success.)

79
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,440
(If the others find out about it, the punishment will be doubled.)

80
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,040
(From the start, the battle between two thieves has started.)

81
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,640
(Will Jae Seok, who has the experience in spying, win?)

82
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,910
(Or will Kwang Soo, who is fast and has good acting skills, win?)

83
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,210
(Who will be the winner?)

84
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,540
(Their mission starts.)

85
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,570
- This is huge. - It sure is.

86
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,310
We really should come here to have fun, but we don't have the time.

87
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,840
It's not like we don't want to.

88
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,570
There are so many things to do here.

89
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,240
- Of course. It will be so much fun. - Let's have sikhye.

90
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,840
(A sight of a warm red clay floor relaxes their bodies.)

91
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,570
I want to go into that room and sleep.

92
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,440
- They have a snack bar, too. - It's a snack bar.

93
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,410
- Where is Ji Hyo? - That's right.

94
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,840
- Ji Hyo has to come. - She's not here?

95
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,040
I thought she might have a separate mission. She's just late.

96
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,840
(What do you mean by a separate mission?)

97
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,040
She's always late.

98
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,170
What a surprise.

99
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,310
No one scolds her for being late.

100
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,610
- We should scold her once. - It's too late for that.

101
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,840
- It's too late. - It's been seven years.

102
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,210
- I will do it. - Why would we do that to her?

103
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,740
- I can't believe she's late again. - Sorry to say this, Seok Jin.

104
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,170
- She doesn't listen to you. - That's true.

105
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,540
(He can't deny it.)

106
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,110
- Let me stretch first. - Seok Jin. If you are going to...

107
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,670
(He seriously gets ready,)

108
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,210
(but he slips.)

109
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,270
- Goodness. - What's wrong with you?

110
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,510
(What an out-dated slapstick.)

111
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,580
(They can't believe Seok Jin did that.)

112
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,140
Seok Jin. Please apologize to the viewers.

113
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,470
- Stop it. - With 20 years of career,

114
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,170
you shouldn't have done it.

115
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,910
- What is this? - He did that on purpose.

116
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,410
(Anyone can do this.)

117
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,410
- Everyone can pull it off. - Everyone can slip.

118
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,140
- Who can't do this? - I didn't do it on purpose.

119
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,940
- Imagine young comedians saw this. - Seriously.

120
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,770
- I slipped because of the socks. - This isn't right.

121
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,940
It's because you wore your socks inside out.

122
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,870
- Hey. - Run. Run!

123
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,040
(Here comes Ji Hyo.)

124
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,110
What time is it?

125
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,910
- What was that? - That's your locker key, not watch.

126
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,270
It's 5:31pm.

127
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,410
(They think it's funny this time.)

128
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,270
Why are you always late?

129
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,210
I was changing.

130
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,840
(That's understandable.)

131
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,610
You're not the only one who went to get changed.

132
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,170
I'm a woman, though.

133
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,870
- That's possible. - Ladies take longer.

134
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,870
- Is this how you'll play it? - What do you mean?

135
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,910
- Hey. Say something. - Girls need more time.

136
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,070
- Girls might need more time. - He must be drunk.

137
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,240
Why is he like this before the shooting?

138
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,310
I apologize.

139
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,970
Why did you scold Ji Hyo?

140
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,440
- Why does it always end like this? - Why is it always like this?

141
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,140
Someday, I will scold you for certain.

142
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,210
- Someday soon, - "I will scold you..."

143
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,140
- I will scold you. - "for certain."

144
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,440
- He will. - I failed again.

145
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,210
In the sauna, you take a rest.

146
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,470
For your rest...

147
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,640
If you have your phones or locker keys...

148
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,370
(Locker room keys?)

149
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,740
(They have to put their phones and keys away.)

150
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,010
- Put them away back there. - My key?

151
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,540
- You have to leave them? - I see.

152
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,410
You usually pay later in saunas.

153
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,370
- We don't have phones with us now. - Let's leave it here.

154
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,270
(They leave their keys without any suspicion.)

155
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,310
Put your phones away, too.

156
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,640
(If the keys are away from the owners,)

157
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,970
(they simply need to steal it in secret.)

158
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,510
(The 4 targets are placed in an open area. Will they be able to succeed?)

159
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,270
This is the break of Member's Week.

160
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,510
Here are the rules of Walk, Don't Run.

161
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,540
In the sauna, there are various relaxing courses.

162
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,270
The members who enjoy each course the most...

163
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,270
will be given mileage points according to their ranking.

164
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,940
- Mileage points? - Yes.

165
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,510
This is an individual match.

166
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,770
With the mileage points,

167
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,770
you can earn prizes and use the snack bar.

168
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,610
If you finish the last course, today's race will end.

169
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,740
Okay.

170
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,740
Now, we'll be heading to savanna,

171
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,170
the first vacation spot.

172
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,410
- Okay. - Let's go.

173
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,210
- Savanna. - Savanna.

174
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,540
Where's savanna?

175
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,340
- It's a room? - It's over there.

176
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,210
- Savanna. - It's the tropics.

177
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,470
Are we going to a hot place?

178
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,740
Where's savanna?

179
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,240
(Even by the name of the first course, we can tell it's hot.)

180
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,440
I really like it.

181
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,270
(Even by the name of the first course, we can tell it's hot.)

182
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,070
(Gosh)

183
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,340
I really like it.

184
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,070
- What do you mean? - This is it.

185
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,910
(The heat wave will fend off all the cold this winter.)

186
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,710
Welcome to the savanna course.

187
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:35,240
There will be missions to help you enjoy the heat in savanna.

188
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,210
It's "Lunch at the Savanna".

189
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,310
"Lunch"?

190
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,640
- So we are eating? - How can we eat in this heat?

191
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,940
In that case,

192
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,110
- you should give us iced sikhye. - I want red-bean sherbet.

193
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,440
Enjoy savanna as long as you can.

194
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,310
The longer you stay, the more mileage points you get.

195
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,810
Your lunch is coming in.

196
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,810
- Gosh. Seriously. - What is it?

197
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,310
(What is it?)

198
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,010
It can't be spicy food.

199
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:06,540
(They want us to eat this?)

200
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,440
(It's hot coffee and a cup of soup.)

201
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,840
It's too hot.

202
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,770
It's too hot.

203
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,240
- It looks hot. - It is.

204
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,810
It would be better to have ramyeon here.

205
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,410
If you finish your meal, you can go outside.

206
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,040
(If I finish my meal, I can go outside?)

207
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,140
- You can go outside. - If I finish my meal?

208
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,510
(If I leave first and secure the targets,)

209
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,640
(the stealing would be much easier.)

210
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,970
(Glancing)

211
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,610
(Let's see who wins.)

212
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,440
(Kwang Soo, you thief!)

213
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,180
(Look who's talking.)

214
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,680
(The first one to finish the meal will get the keys.)

215
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,310
They are so creative in making games.

216
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,740
- Can I have water? - I'm already sweating.

217
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,440
(Slurping)

218
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,210
What's wrong with him?

219
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,510
(He sacrifices his mouth to get out first.)

220
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,840
- It's too hot. - What's wrong with you?

221
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,940
It's really hot.

222
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,840
It's really hot.

223
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,740
(Savanna doesn't get along with me.)

224
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,180
- Look at this. - It's steaming.

225
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,240
This is too hot.

226
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,910
- This is too much. - It's steaming.

227
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,180
- I can't eat all of this. - Like cures like.

228
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,180
(It doesn't have to be this hot.)

229
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,640
(The temperature is high, the food is hot, and they are stressed out.)

230
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,910
It's regretful that the viewers...

231
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,840
won't be able to feel this heat.

232
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,210
- It's really hot. - You don't have to eat fast, right?

233
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,640
Seok Jin, what's that over there?

234
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,810
(Pouring)

235
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,510
What are you doing?

236
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,040
(Have some more. It's a present from me.)

237
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,510
(He wishes Seok Jin to eat slowly and sweat it out.)

238
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,370
- Did you pour yours here? - No, I didn't.

239
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,870
- I'm being serious. I ate them all. - You don't have much left.

240
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,210
- I ate them all. - I saw you did it.

241
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,140
(Look at his being cunning.)

242
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,840
(He stands up slowly.)

243
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,710
- I saw you did it. - I didn't.

244
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,310
(He's blocking the exit.)

245
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,270
- What are you doing? - It's really hot.

246
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,910
- What are you doing? - It's really hot.

247
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,740
- What is he doing? - He's trying to do something.

248
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,440
- What are you trying to do? - Nothing.

249
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,510
- The speed isn't important here. - It's better to eat slowly.

250
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,180
Can I have this?

251
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,610
- Why are you using that? - I want to cool it off.

252
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,070
- Why are you eating so fast? - Why is that?

253
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,470
- Why? - Why?

254
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,840
Was this your idea?

255
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,810
- He's hiding something. - He probably is.

256
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,040
- I like hot food. - He's hiding something.

257
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,040
He's hiding something. Are you?

258
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,040
- It's not me. - I knew something was off.

259
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,610
There are only giraffes on the wall when they say it's savanna.

260
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,940
- What? Where? - That's true.

261
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,740
(Savanna and giraffe? They are correlatable.)

262
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,240
- Wait a second. - He's right.

263
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,570
We shouldn't let him out.

264
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,510
- Kwang Soo. - We shouldn't let him out.

265
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,470
- He's trying to go outside fast. - He's acting weird.

266
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,070
- Come here. - Come here. Give it to me.

267
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,180
- No, that's not true. - Give me the cup.

268
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,270
- It's a giraffe room. - It's a safari.

269
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,970
- He is sharp. - It's a giraffe room.

270
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,470
This is a giraffe room and Kwang Soo's mission.

271
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,810
- How did you spot the giraffe? - He's so sharp.

272
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,370
How can you not?

273
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,740
This is suspicious.

274
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,770
He's acting strangely now. He's very suspicious.

275
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,340
Kwang Soo is sweating so much.

276
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,440
I just can't stand it here.

277
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,240
Wait. Let's look behind the picture.

278
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,910
- You're not supposed to go out. - It's too hot in here.

279
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,870
(Where are you going?)

280
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,370
It's too hot in here.

281
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,970
Look. He's trying to stop me.

282
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,310
You can't give up already.

283
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,010
- You can't give up already. - It's too hot. My feet are too hot.

284
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,640
- You can't give up now. - Let me out.

285
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,810
- What are you doing? - He's hiding something.

286
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,140
What are you doing?

287
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,310
(Chaos in savanna)

288
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,310
If you finish your meal, you can go outside?

289
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,570
(The herbivores suffering from heat waves are in chaos.)

290
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:38,340
(The seemingly impregnable fortress is now defenseless.)

291
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,840
(Jae Seok succeeds in escaping without being suspected.)

292
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,370
(He's a nimble grasshopper.)

293
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,940
It's so hot.

294
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,010
(He reaches the snack bar faster than anyone.)

295
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,470
(There are four targets.)

296
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,670
(Who has the heaviest clothes?)

297
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,740
Who has the heaviest clothes?

298
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,670
I think it's Ji Hyo.

299
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,710
(Ji Hyo's fur jacket?)

300
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,770
I choose Seok Jin.

301
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,410
(He steals Seok Jin's key as it's easily accessible.)

302
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,110
Can I have a key?

303
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:10,470
(He borrows a fake key so that he won't be suspected.)

304
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,770
(Now that he has the key, he only has to steal.)

305
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,940
It's Seok Jin's.

306
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,170
(I'm going to steal his clothes now.)

307
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,540
It was really hot.

308
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,270
(It's a long way from the sauna to the locker room.)

309
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,540
(The target is right in front of me.)

310
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,540
It's 1731.

311
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,410
Where is his locker?

312
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,140
(Somewhere here...)

313
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,070
(I found it!)

314
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,010
(He even takes the socks.)

315
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,940
(He's running really fast.)

316
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,440
(Seok Jin's clothes get stolen first.)

317
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,940
- Here you go. - Whose clothes are they?

318
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,940
It's Seok Jin's.

319
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,840
- Where's the key? - It's here.

320
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,410
(Jae Seok succeeds in stealing Seok Jin's clothes.)

321
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,670
Did I succeed?

322
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:00,070
(Jae Seok earns 2.6kg.)

323
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,840
- Why did Kwang Soo stop him? - Wait.

324
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,270
Kwang Soo is hiding something.

325
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,410
- Kwang Soo is very suspicious. - He is?

326
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,010
- He tried to stop Jae Seok. - I know. Why would he do that?

327
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,570
(Why did Kwang Soo stop Jae Seok?)

328
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,510
(This game is about staying as long as possible.)

329
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,710
Why did he stop Jae Seok?

330
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,970
Everything is weird.

331
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,110
(He can't think of an excuse.)

332
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,110
Jae Seok failed because he went out first.

333
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,140
It's driving me crazy.

334
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,140
You came back. Welcome.

335
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,570
I went outside first. I guess I failed.

336
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,170
(Temper rising)

337
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:36,510
- This is the second dish for you. - What is this?

338
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,040
(What is this smell?)

339
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,640
- It's not steaming, yet so hot. - I can't eat all of this.

340
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,340
(We introduce you to the spicy chicken feet from savanna.)

341
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,140
I want to escape because of the food.

342
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,210
(I'm stressed out already.)

343
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,140
(This is supposed to be delicious when it's eaten in hot places.)

344
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,810
- It's killing me. - This is too much.

345
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,740
I can't eat all of this.

346
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,210
(Ji Hyo, who enjoys spicy food, tastes the dish first.)

347
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,810
This looks so red.

348
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,470
They put too much spicy sauce.

349
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,670
(It's really spicy.)

350
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,740
It's too spicy.

351
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,640
(This is my chance to escape.)

352
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,170
(My tongue hurts.)

353
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,010
It's hot in here.

354
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,810
It's driving me crazy.

355
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,240
(This feels like a virtual reality of savanna.)

356
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,410
It's no joke.

357
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,840
(Heat rising)

358
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,110
- It's really spicy. - It is.

359
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,040
Chicken feet are delicious when it is spicy.

360
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,540
If it's not, it loses its taste.

361
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,840
It's unbelievable.

362
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,210
Can I drink water outside?

363
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,010
(Are you using water as your excuse?)

364
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:38,010
(No one is thinking straight. This is the only opportunity.)

365
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,910
- Yes. - I can't do it anymore.

366
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,140
He's hiding something.

367
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,910
He's hiding something.

368
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,840
(His plan fails in 5 seconds.)

369
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,440
- I'm 100 percent sure. - He's hiding something.

370
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,840
You're making it too obvious.

371
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,210
(I don't care.)

372
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,670
Kwang Soo is going out. I'm going too.

373
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,510
Wait. I'll stay a bit more.

374
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,570
- Go out. - Wait.

375
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,740
- It's better when you stand up. - I'm the fourth then.

376
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,310
- Aren't you out? - You are already out.

377
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,840
- He's out. - I'm going crazy.

378
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,170
- Am I out? - You are out.

379
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,070
- Are you going outside? - He's out, right?

380
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
I can't stand it.

381
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,310
(Seok Jin gives up and heads to the ice room.)

382
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,570
- There's an ice room there. - I'm going crazy.

383
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,410
(Seok Jin is not helping.)

384
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,540
The ice room is the best.

385
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,070
How can they stay inside?

386
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,070
(What am I to do?)

387
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,710
I really can't stand it.

388
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,170
- What are you doing? - He's leaving.

389
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,740
(Kwang Soo, you should stay inside. Where are you going?)

390
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,610
Maybe Jae Seok and Kwang Soo have something together.

391
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,040
(Are those two going mad because of the heat?)

392
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,140
Why can't I do this?

393
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,810
(Kwang Soo punches Jae Seok.)

394
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,410
(There's a lot going on in this room.)

395
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,370
(He finally escapes from the savanna.)

396
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,440
(While Seok Jin is away, he runs towards the locker room.)

397
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,810
(Kwang Soo's first target is Haha.)

398
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,210
Haha's clothes looked the heaviest.

399
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,670
Here's your third menu.

400
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,240
- What's this? - It's spicy ramyeon.

401
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,710
I love this ramyeon.

402
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,510
(They only focus on the mission.)

403
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,270
I don't want to eat that.

404
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,570
You must leave if you don't eat.

405
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,410
Fine, I'll go out.

406
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,940
- He's heading to the ice room. - What?

407
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,570
Haha's clothes looked the heaviest.

408
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,610
(Haha is too busy eating ramyeon.)

409
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,940
(He's running out of time.)

410
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,140
It's 2127.

411
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,640
(He must steal Haha's clothes before he leaves the savanna.)

412
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,840
Here's a warm jacket for you.

413
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,310
(Haha gives up.)

414
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,140
No, don't leave.

415
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,710
(Ji Hyo is the final winner.)

416
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,770
Ji Hyo wins first place.

417
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,840
(Kwang Soo has no time.)

418
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,110
It's locker number 2127.

419
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,440
(He must steal now.)

420
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,040
Okay.

421
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,110
(There's a heap of clothes.)

422
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,210
(He's in a hurry.)

423
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,810
(He goes to weigh the clothes.)

424
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:43,870
Hello.

425
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,340
(How much do Haha's clothes weigh?)

426
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,640
Please weigh these.

427
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,810
They're lighter than I thought.

428
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,440
I should have stolen Ji Hyo's.

429
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,170
(Jae Seok is ahead by 0.4kg.)

430
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,270
Is Kwang Soo missing?

431
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,370
(He hurries to go back.)

432
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,510
Things became clear.

433
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,540
What are you doing, Kwang Soo?

434
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,310
(He's in a daze after his first theft.)

435
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,740
How dejected do you feel?

436
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,610
It's because we found out.

437
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,070
He didn't have enough time to clear the mission.

438
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,170
Is that so?

439
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,440
I'm not the one.

440
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,340
His plan was wasted because of you, Jae Seok.

441
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,510
Is that right? You must...

442
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,570
- do something for me in return. - Of course.

443
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,210
- His plan was wasted because of me. - Right.

444
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,710
(Kwang Soo wants to expose him.)

445
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,740
- What's wrong? - Stop it.

446
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,110
What's wrong with you?

447
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,770
- I'm a victim. - This is unfair.

448
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,610
- What Haha said reminded me. - Either way,

449
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,810
- we recognize you for what you did. - Okay.

450
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,710
People were suspicious of me last week when it was Gary.

451
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,840
Why did you try to stop Jae Seok from leaving?

452
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,740
I'm very curious.

453
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,240
It was strange that Kwang Soo tried to stop him.

454
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,010
Why did you try to stop him?

455
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:54,210
Why did Kwang Soo block Jae Seok from leaving?

456
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,170
- I'm very curious. - Why did you do it?

457
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:00,940
- Why did you block me? - Follow me, Kwang Soo.

458
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,610
- To where? - Come to this room.

459
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,710
Do you have to discuss something?

460
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,380
They're suspicious.

461
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,710
- It's very hot in here. - Are they up to something?

462
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,070
- We don't have our phones or keys. - They took them from us.

463
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,270
There's something going on over there.

464
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,070
- They may put something in lockers. - That's right.

465
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,970
They shot a video of that.

466
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,340
- There must be a reason why. - They took a video...

467
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,880
of us changing as well.

468
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,570
- Why did we have to leave them? - They recorded me when I was naked.

469
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,970
Stop acting like that, Jae Seok.

470
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,310
What do you mean?

471
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,440
- They might find out. - Okay, let's be careful.

472
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,640
(What will happen to Jae Seok and Kwang Soo?)

473
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,940
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo are the remaining targets.)

474
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,840
(The members return to the locker room.)

475
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,240
Why do you keep filming us?

476
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,970
- Why do you film so much today? - What's going on?

477
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,540
It's strange.

478
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,740
(He suspects something.)

479
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,010
Why do you keep filming us?

480
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,910
Why do you keep filming us?

481
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,840
Why?

482
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,410
They do?

483
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,840
Are you filming us?

484
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,540
It's locker number 2127.

485
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,710
(Kwang Soo searches something.)

486
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,410
Kwang Soo.

487
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,740
(Haha is too quick to notice.)

488
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,170
Kwang Soo? Is he here?

489
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,210
(Haha is suspicious while Jong Kook is the target.)

490
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,240
Things became clear.

491
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,670
- Jong Kook, do you want to go? - Where?

492
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:26,270
I need to check the counter where I left my phone.

493
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,040
(My goodness)

494
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,010
Something is going on.

495
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,610
(He definitely senses something.)

496
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,510
Shall I check it out?

497
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,640
(He might find out.)

498
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,210
(They must move quickly.)

499
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:44,410
(Jae Seok must start the mission before Haha finds out.)

500
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,470
(He starts his 2nd theft.)

501
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,140
(He runs for Jong Kook's key.)

502
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,240
Which way?

503
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,910
Where are you going?

504
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,510
- I'm going to the bathroom. - It's this way.

505
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,340
- Where? - The bathroom is here.

506
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,440
(They run for the key.)

507
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,470
(It's a chase in the sauna.)

508
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,880
(The first to arrive takes the key.)

509
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,310
(Kwang Soo won't let him go.)

510
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,170
- Don't go. - You can't do this.

511
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,140
You can't do this, Kwang Soo.

512
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,510
(Their peace breaks after 5 minutes.)

513
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,770
Calm down, Kwang Soo.

514
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,470
(Calm down.)

515
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,710
- Kwang Soo, calm down. - If we don't stop, we'll be caught.

516
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,010
- I'm at a disadvantage. - Let's calm down.

517
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,240
Let's calm down, Kwang Soo.

518
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,140
- How about this? - I'm in a bad situation.

519
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,440
That's why I'm acting like this.

520
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,070
Let's try to control ourselves.

521
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,540
Please give me a break.

522
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,810
Why did you...

523
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,740
Let's just tell them the truth.

524
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,940
(He sighs.)

525
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,010
Don't be such a bully.

526
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,440
You shouldn't talk like that.

527
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,440
Let's tell them the truth.

528
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,380
Let's be honest to them.

529
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,240
I scalded my tongue.

530
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,770
I had to endure the pain because of what you did.

531
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:02,940
Let's be fair.

532
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,710
Let's play fairly.

533
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:08,640
(They promise to be at peace.)

534
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,440
(Kwang Soo was lying.)

535
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,770
(They go back to fighting again.)

536
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,640
(They won't be easy on each other.)

537
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,070
(Jae Seok bites him.)

538
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,410
(Kwang Soo hits him.)

539
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,110
(He goes for a vital point as they're in a sauna.)

540
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,110
(Here's a massage for Jae Seok.)

541
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,670
(They struggle.)

542
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,770
(Kwang Soo doesn't let him go.)

543
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,970
(Kwang Soo continues to hit.)

544
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,970
(Disobedience deserves a good beating.)

545
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,770
(It prickles his whole body.)

546
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,340
(He runs as fast as possible.)

547
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,140
(Catch the thief.)

548
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,240
(He continues to run.)

549
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,310
(He grabs Ji Hyo's key.)

550
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,370
Please give me the key.

551
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,510
Give me the key.

552
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,040
(Jae Seok chooses Ji Hyo as his target.)

553
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,010
(He's a little late.)

554
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,010
(He goes for Jong Kook's.)

555
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,370
(Kwang Soo takes Jong Kook's key.)

556
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,010
Will you do it now?

557
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,870
- Will you steal now? - What?

558
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,110
- Are you going to steal? - No, not right away.

559
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,070
My goodness.

560
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,570
When I compete with you, it becomes too messy.

561
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,240
What's wrong with you?

562
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,170
You punk.

563
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,270
(You're so clumsy.)

564
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,610
It's too tight on you.

565
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,070
(He slaps him.)

566
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,940
(He gives a high five to his cheek.)

567
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,440
I was fixing your microphone. It's too short.

568
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,910
It's too short.

569
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,540
I don't understand every time you attack me.

570
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,340
I never know when to expect it.

571
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,340
Wait, Jae Seok.

572
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,610
(He slaps him back.)

573
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,470
What are you doing?

574
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,140
I'm sorry, but I couldn't help myself.

575
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,270
You're a dirty punk.

576
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,710
(They start to fight again.)

577
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,070
(They break into a messy fight.)

578
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,670
(Jae Seok bites him.)

579
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,170
(Kwang Soo attacks him the same way.)

580
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,570
(Electricity runs through his body.)

581
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,540
Kwang Soo, you're a dirty punk.

582
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,540
I'm not the only one.

583
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,610
Whom are you calling dirty?

584
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,670
Let's not make it messy.

585
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,970
If they find out, it's over for us.

586
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:18,970
(The others are clueless.)

587
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,840
We must be very careful.

588
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,740
We'll look suspicious if we go in together.

589
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,340
- I'll go in first. - Okay.

590
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,940
(They move separately all the time.)

591
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,110
Could you keep it for me?

592
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,710
Keep it for me.

593
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,070
(He gets rid of evidence.)

594
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,640
Are you still filming us?

595
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,370
Are you still filming?

596
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,070
They keep filming us.

597
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,410
(Why?)

598
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,210
(He feels something strange.)

599
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,310
What's going on?

600
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,210
(Where's Jong Kook?)

601
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,070
(Where are you, Jong Kook?)

602
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,340
I'm going to the bathroom.

603
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:57,640
(Jong Kook goes to the bathroom.)

604
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,640
Okay, now is the time.

605
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,140
Shall I go check? Jong Kook?

606
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,010
(Kwang Soo steals while Haha suspects something.)

607
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,970
(Kwang Soo finds the locker.)

608
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:19,070
(He steals Jong Kook's clothes discreetly.)

609
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:24,870
(Will Kwang Soo leave the scene before Jong Kook comes out?)

610
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,410
(He covers up the clothes with towels.)

611
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,840
What are you doing?

612
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,040
(He's startled.)

613
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,770
What are you doing?

614
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,440
(Kwang Soo is caught in the act.)

615
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,570
What are you doing?

616
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,340
Kwang Soo.

617
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,810
You're being too suspicious.

618
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,440
What are you doing?

619
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,840
Hey.

620
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,410
(He simply wants to talk.)

621
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,370
(He runs barefoot.)

622
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,010
Gosh.

623
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:59,710
(He's doomed.)

624
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,470
He's acting very strange.

625
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,870
What's going on?

626
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,510
I think he did something in the locker room.

627
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,610
(My goodness, Kwang Soo is caught.)

628
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,210
- He's on a mission. - Where's Jong Kook?

629
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,570
(He pretends not to know.)

630
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,040
Around which locker was he?

631
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,440
It must be one of ours.

632
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,910
(He's definitely caught.)

633
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,970
What?

634
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,370
Jong Kook.

635
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,010
Pardon me.

636
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,210
Did we get caught?

637
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,540
(They completely ruined it.)

638
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,770
He got caught.

639
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,770
(Why is he still running around?)

640
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,710
Didn't he get caught?

641
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:43,340
(Kwang Soo is running as fast as he can.)

642
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,270
(I'll just check these in anyway.)

643
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,870
Whatever. It's Jong Kook's.

644
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,940
- Hey. - Don't talk to me.

645
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,440
Hey, come here.

646
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,340
(He submitted 1.1kg of Jong Kook's clothes.)

647
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,910
You got caught.

648
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,410
(I don't care.)

649
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,940
- What is this? - What are you doing?

650
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,610
What are you doing?

651
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,870
(We'd love to hear your story.)

652
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,510
(He's still acting.)

653
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:14,310
- What are you doing? - What is this?

654
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:17,010
- How can you be so clumsy? - It's nothing.

655
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,310
What is this?

656
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,510
Don't follow me.

657
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,310
What is this? How can you do it so blatantly?

658
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,740
- From now on... - It's a fail, isn't it?

659
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,970
- What is he thinking? - He's in trouble.

660
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,340
What's his plan?

661
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:35,970
This is hilarious.

662
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,410
I was wondering why cameras were following us around.

663
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,040
It's a total fail.

664
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,440
Viewers, I'm sorry.

665
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,140
I'm hopeless.

666
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,610
(The hopeless man speaks.)

667
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,940
I'm ruined.

668
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,040
(Miserable)

669
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,210
Viewers.

670
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,640
Please look forward to my Member's Week.

671
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,140
See you then.

672
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,310
(Bye for now.)

673
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:08,040
I'll work harder from next week.

674
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,170
(I'm a terrible sinner.)

675
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,670
I'm sorry.

676
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:14,310
(What are we going to do now?)

677
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,710
I'm sorry.

678
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:19,710
Hey, look forward to my Member's Week.

679
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:25,440
(The "Steal Their Clothes" project is off the track.)

680
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,040
I caught him rummaging through your locker.

681
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,070
- Really? - His locker?

682
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,140
- Right in front of my eyes. - Gosh.

683
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,610
What is he going to do now? It's become a total flop.

684
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,510
What are you doing, Kwang Soo?

685
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,970
- What are you going to do? - It's such a flop.

686
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:41,110
- You blew it, right? - Did you blow it?

687
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,110
(I need to record this moment.)

688
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,210
He did seem suspicious.

689
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,870
(The aftermath of failure.jpg)

690
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,910
It's time for a special activity.

691
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:54,910
- What is it? - What is it?

692
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:58,910
It has a theme of Jeju Island, the representative vacation spot.

693
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,670
Welcome to Jeju Island!

694
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,610
(Jeju Island)

695
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:08,310
(How will they be forced to relax on Jeju Island?)

696
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,740
The mission is called "Resting Room".

697
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:15,170
- I love it. - Behind you...

698
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,340
are rooms for you.

699
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,610
People actually sleep in here.

700
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,940
You can lie down and relax there.

701
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,170
You're supposed to lie straight.

702
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,810
If your back comes off the floor...

703
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,240
(Funny)

704
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,010
- You're out. - What?

705
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,370
- It's a great chance for Kwang Soo. - Exactly.

706
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,810
Doesn't it remind you of the movie "Saw"?

707
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,340
(Stop talking about my mission.)

708
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,310
(Hilarious)

709
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,310
If you get up last,

710
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,510
you can get something...

711
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,070
- at the cafeteria. - Right.

712
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,540
- They're giving us money. - Really?

713
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,340
We should do our best to the end.

714
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,710
- Let's not get up. - Of course not.

715
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,610
(Do whatever you wish.)

716
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,810
- Okay. - Let's do that.

717
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,710
- Let's not get up. - For Kwang Soo to do his job...

718
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:58,710
(Forget about stealing clothes.)

719
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,040
- Let's... - Kwang Soo needs to do his job.

720
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,710
Let's not get up no matter what.

721
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,770
Don't take your back off the floor, Ji Hyo.

722
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,040
Shouldn't he be taken home?

723
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,610
- Okay, so first... - He's done with his job.

724
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,140
Let's let him do his job.

725
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,340
- Don't come out. - We won't.

726
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,970
- Let's go. - Let's lie down.

727
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,140
(The Jeju Island course starts.)

728
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,570
It's so nice.

729
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:21,970
We get to relax while shooting.

730
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,710
(The sound of waves)

731
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,440
- What is it? - What is it?

732
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,870
It's the sound of waves.

733
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,340
We're on Jeju Island.

734
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,870
Will music play?

735
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,510
I wonder what Kwang Soo will do.

736
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,610
Let's leave

737
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,170
(It's Red Velvet's song.)

738
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:45,040
- What is this? - Is Red Velvet here?

739
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,110
- Are they here? - Really?

740
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,110
(Is Red Velvet here?)

741
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,210
- Wait. - Really?

742
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:54,310
(They're the most popular girl group right now.)

743
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,910
(Are they really at the sauna?)

744
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,970
(Everyone is extremely curious.)

745
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,310
Is Red Velvet here?

746
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,510
Are they here?

747
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,410
(We're here.)

748
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,210
Really?

749
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,710
(Red Velvet is performing at the sauna.)

750
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,140
- Wait. - Where are they?

751
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,810
(You can't resist us.)

752
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,670
Is Red Velvet here?

753
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,770
- What should I do? - Are they here?

754
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,940
(They're too attractive to resist.)

755
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:23,970
(Wriggling)

756
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,910
- Seul Gi. - They're really here.

757
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,110
Wait!

758
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,410
(He gets up.)

759
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,110
(They're really here.)

760
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,140
What should I do?

761
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,270
(He falls.)

762
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,770
(Jae Seok is out.)

763
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:41,970
This can't be true.

764
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,110
(Jong Kook is desperate.)

765
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,110
Oh, my.

766
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,810
("Rookie" by Red Velvet)

767
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,070
What's going on?

768
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,410
(Cute)

769
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,440
What is this?

770
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,410
(Please tell me they're not here.)

771
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,270
(They start to sing their new song "Rookie".)

772
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:59,910
(I want to see them.)

773
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,010
Why are you here?

774
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,470
Mister, you're blocking me!

775
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,740
Mister, you're blocking me!

776
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,440
(Kwang Soo gets up.)

777
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:10,870
(You should have gotten up earlier.)

778
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,310
- Even Seul Gi is here. - Seriously.

779
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,440
- Is everyone here? - It's unbelievable.

780
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,710
Nice to see you. What brings you here?

781
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,140
- Why are you here? - Hello.

782
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,610
(Welcome, Red Velvet.)

783
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,710
- Hello. - What is this?

784
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,940
Jae Seok is in 7th place, and Kwang Soo is in 5th.

785
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,310
(They both lose 3 points.)

786
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,310
My goodness.

787
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,770
I have nothing to do with this game. Leave me alone.

788
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,210
- Jae Seok is in seventh place. - My goodness.

789
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,910
- This is unbelievable. - Goodness.

790
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,140
(The others will soon get cramps.)

791
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,910
Welcome to Jeju Island.

792
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,710
You're going to carry out this mission with Red Velvet.

793
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:46,440
- With them? - It's "Couple Race on Olle Trails".

794
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,440
What's that?

795
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,570
You're going to play charades...

796
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:52,140
- with Red Velvet... - Joy is not here.

797
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,070
- to decide partners. - Joy isn't here.

798
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:57,040
The one who says the right answer first will be the member's partner.

799
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,570
Is it a couple game?

800
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,770
- Yes. - Really?

801
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,010
(Is it a couple game?)

802
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,110
Really?

803
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,210
(Motivated)

804
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,940
We need to get it right to become partners?

805
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,040
Can we get up now?

806
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,770
Kwang Soo has been Joy's partner.

807
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,810
(Kwang Soo was Joy's partner in a race before.)

808
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,770
(Today, Joy couldn't come because of another show.)

809
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,010
(Will he stay faithful to Joy?)

810
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:24,710
No. We broke up. It was a long time ago.

811
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,240
(To get over someone, meet someone new.)

812
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,440
- It was nothing serious. - I'll tell Joy.

813
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,340
- Gosh. - It was nothing serious.

814
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,810
I'll tell Joy.

815
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,940
She had a husband in another show!

816
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,970
That's over now.

817
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,810
(I enjoyed watching your marriage life.)

818
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,110
That's over.

819
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,740
- It's over now. - By the way,

820
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,270
if you take your back off the floor,

821
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,070
you'll be out.

822
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,710
Keep your back on the floor.

823
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,910
- You can still see them. - Can we?

824
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,010
If you do, you're out.

825
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,340
Can't we take our backs off the floor?

826
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,810
(Kwang Soo's neck is off the floor.)

827
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,710
(Kwang Soo, keep your neck on the floor.)

828
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,170
What? My back is still on the floor.

829
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,140
My back is still on the floor.

830
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,340
What are you doing?

831
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,510
My back is on the floor.

832
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,070
- What about other parts? - You can take them off the floor.

833
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:09,040
(I'm happy I'm short.)

834
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,310
The first question will be given...

835
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:15,210
- by Irene. - Irene?

836
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,670
(These guys are a bit scary.)

837
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,810
I'll get this one.

838
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,910
Ready, start.

839
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,070
Is it a proverb?

840
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,210
(A bump on the back)

841
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:28,210
(There's a bump on her back, and she's startled.)

842
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:33,310
(The one who says the right answer will be Irene's partner.)

843
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,170
(Jae Seok gets up.)

844
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,210
I know.

845
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:40,240
- You're out. - Why?

846
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,410
(Jae Seok is out as soon as he shouts, "I know.")

847
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,440
Your back is off the floor. Stand over there.

848
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,810
- Why am I out? - Your back is off the floor.

849
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,610
Can't I get up when I say the answer?

850
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,410
No. You're out.

851
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:54,070
(The other five have the chance now.)

852
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,710
I know.

853
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,510
- "Startled by a caldron lid..." - "Startled by a caldron lid..."

854
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,270
- "after by a turtle." - "after by a turtle."

855
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,570
- Correct, Haha. - Gosh.

856
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,570
(I'm Irene's partner.)

857
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:04,940
I wanted to help Kwang Soo.

858
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,940
(I want a partner, too.)

859
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:12,040
- I said the answer, too. - Irene doesn't seem happy.

860
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,170
(Haha and Irene are a couple.)

861
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,410
The second question will be given by...

862
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:18,110
Wendy.

863
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,610
- Wendy? - Wendy?

864
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,870
(Creeping)

865
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,410
(He's so fast.)

866
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,610
(What is this mysterious creature?)

867
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,640
- I can't see anything! - Kwang Soo.

868
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,710
Aren't there clams like that?

869
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,170
Pen shells.

870
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,010
(Name: Kwang Soo, Habitat: Sauna)

871
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,970
Ready, start.

872
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,440
(Two)

873
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,440
(Diving)

874
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,210
- I think I know. - What is it?

875
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,410
It's a dolphin.

876
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:44,610
(Fins)

877
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,040
(Fighting)

878
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,810
"When whales fight, shrimps burst."

879
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,210
(I said it first, Wendy.)

880
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,610
- I know. - I know.

881
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,910
(They shout the answer at the same time.)

882
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:57,810
(Who gets the chance?)

883
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:59,370
- Kwang Soo. - I know!

884
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:02,070
- Kwang Soo. - I'm not done yet.

885
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,710
- She's so motivated. - Wait.

886
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,810
Am I...

887
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,610
- not your type? - Hold on.

888
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,070
(She's finishing up.)

889
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:11,070
I know! "When whales fight, shrimps burst."

890
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,470
Correct. Go.

891
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,840
Wait. Is this how you're going to do it?

892
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:18,140
(Ji Hyo and Wendy are a couple.)

893
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,340
Are you serious?

894
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,670
(Both his mission and quiz failed.)

895
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,210
I already blew the mission.

896
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,870
Kwang Soo said the answer.

897
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,870
My Member's Week will be a war against the staff.

898
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:35,170
Isn't this your Member's Week?

899
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,210
- I thought this was your special. - I'm going to go against them.

900
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:41,840
(They thought it was Kwang Soo's Week for sure.)

901
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,310
Here's the third question.

902
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,110
- Here's question number 3. - There are only 2 people left.

903
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,510
- Ye Ri. - Yes!

904
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,140
I think she'll be good.

905
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,140
Ready. Make sure you say, "I know".

906
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,210
- I'm going to get this one right. - Ready.

907
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,310
Set...

908
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,340
Kwang Soo, you can't look...

909
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,840
Why are you only picking on me?

910
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,310
I'm losing patience.

911
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,340
- You're done. - Ready.

912
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,040
Set, go.

913
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,240
How do I describe this?

914
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,410
(Crouching)

915
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,840
- Are you taking a dump? - No way.

916
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,840
(No way.)

917
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,870
(Why did you do that?)

918
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,970
I know!

919
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,640
(He knows.)

920
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,670
(There are only Ye Ri and Seul Gi left from Red Velvet.)

921
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:26,740
(If you're unlucky, you'll end up with 1 of these 3.)

922
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,870
I know!

923
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,570
"The pot calling the kettle black."

924
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,710
- Correct. - Yes.

925
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,410
(Kwang Soo is correct.)

926
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,840
- Finally. - There's only one left.

927
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,210
(Kwang Soo finally becomes a couple.)

928
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,340
- Hello. - How did you guess that?

929
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,040
My gosh.

930
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,280
(Are you watching, Joy?)

931
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,410
Now,

932
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,370
- there's only one couple left. - There's Seul Gi left.

933
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,640
It's Seul Gi.

934
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,610
Ready.

935
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,410
Set, go.

936
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:02,240
(Collapsing)

937
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,410
"Even if you die..."

938
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,740
(The name tag?)

939
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,110
- I know! - "He who leaves the fame..."

940
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,110
- I know! - I know!

941
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,710
- I know! - Jae Seok.

942
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,040
"There's always a way out if you keep your head on..."

943
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,070
I know!

944
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,540
(Let's go down together, partner in crime.)

945
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,280
- I know. - Jong Kook.

946
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,840
- "He who leaves the fame..." - I know.

947
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,240
"of good works after him does not die."

948
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,540
- Correct. - That's the answer?

949
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,670
Of course.

950
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,070
Good job.

951
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,340
She explained it well.

952
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,170
- You're the best. - So...

953
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:34,240
Jae Seok and Seok Jin are a couple.

954
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,740
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin are a couple.)

955
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,240
What is this?

956
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,670
- You're the Team Middle Age. - You didn't answer correctly.

957
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,570
(These are the couples.)

958
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:48,170
We'll get started with "Couple Race on Olle Trails".

959
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:51,310
You cannot run. You can only power walk.

960
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,940
If you get two warnings, you're eliminated.

961
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,140
- Do we go together? - I think so.

962
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,810
(It looks like...)

963
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:02,210
(there's only Ji Hyo's locker left.)

964
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:05,310
(There are two thieves and only one Ji Hyo.)

965
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,570
(The result depends on Ji Hyo's locker room.)

966
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,910
(Which thief will steal Ji Hyo's clothes?)

967
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,670
(They get ready for the race.)

968
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,510
Ye Ri, I'm sorry...

969
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,410
- but everybody will attack us. - 10 seconds.

970
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,040
- Us? Why? - 10,

971
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,840
nine,

972
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,210
- eight, - They'll come at us for sure.

973
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,840
(He rushes her.)

974
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,940
I'm done today.

975
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,040
- Four, - Get ready.

976
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,570
- He's going down. - three, two,

977
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,140
- Let's go after him. - one.

978
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,910
(The chasing starts.)

979
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,340
- There's a mission. - He ran for a mission.

980
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,570
(They think Kwang Soo left for a mission.)

981
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,470
My goodness.

982
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,010
(Is that Kwang Soo?)

983
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:46,170
(He ran into a dead end.)

984
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,870
- You startled me. - My goodness.

985
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,940
- I feel so bad. - Leave me alone.

986
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,610
Please leave me alone.

987
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,740
You startled me.

988
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,610
(This must be your day.)

989
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,910
- What if I don't do anything? - I'm scared.

990
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,540
(Leave me alone.)

991
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,040
Is everybody here?

992
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,470
They are.

993
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,280
(Jong Kook's team is not around.)

994
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,670
Is there any other teams?

995
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:12,440
(The tiger eyes for its prey that's away from the others.)

996
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,470
All right.

997
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,710
What's going on?

998
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:18,040
(He lies in ambush.)

999
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,870
He's not very useful.

1000
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:20,910
(The cameramen start moving.)

1001
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:21,970
Kwang Soo's coming.

1002
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,170
- Let's follow them. - There's somebody.

1003
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,710
(Why is everybody moving away?)

1004
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,470
(They exchange glances.)

1005
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:33,470
- I saw his yellow hair. - She saw your yellow hair and face.

1006
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,940
- He looks like a lion. - He saw your lion-like face.

1007
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,870
- That's right, Kwang Soo. - Jong Kook.

1008
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,670
- Hello. - Hi.

1009
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,870
Help us.

1010
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,540
Kwang Soo's having a mental breakdown.

1011
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,280
- There's nothing he can do. - There's absolutely nothing.

1012
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,870
He has to do something but everybody's watching him.

1013
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,170
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin are looking for a chance.)

1014
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,540
What's going on with Haha?

1015
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,340
We have to get started.

1016
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,040
We have to rip their name tags.

1017
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,470
(We have to look for a chance.)

1018
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,940
- Should I start with the guys? - Sure.

1019
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,780
- Should I start with the guys? - Sure.

1020
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,640
What if we become allies, Kwang Soo?

1021
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,780
(They join force to eliminate Jae Seok and Seok Jin.)

1022
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,280
They're planning to get rid of us.

1023
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,310
(They decide to eliminate Jae Seok and Seok Jin first.)

1024
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,370
They're coming.

1025
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:19,280
(It's a power walking race.)

1026
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:20,780
Go for it, Jong Kook.

1027
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,670
(Is he using the elevator?)

1028
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,240
(These two are in trouble.)

1029
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,510
(Let's use the elevator.)

1030
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:35,740
(He can't face them by himself.)

1031
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,410
(Where are the others?)

1032
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:39,170
Run in immediately.

1033
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,540
(He bumps into Jong Kook.)

1034
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,370
(Jong Kook is in the elevator.)

1035
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,440
(They show up in front of Jong Kook.)

1036
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:51,740
- No way. - Eliminate them.

1037
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,670
(Kwang Soo joins in.)

1038
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,280
- Jae Seok. - Yes.

1039
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,280
- We ripped it. - This is no joke.

1040
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,570
My gosh.

1041
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:03,410
- Good luck, everybody. - Okay.

1042
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,040
You're good.

1043
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,010
- What should we do? - What if we join hands?

1044
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,070
If we form allies and start eliminating one at a time...

1045
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,370
- Hold on. - What's wrong?

1046
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,240
- Why? - I'll just...

1047
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,640
go upstairs and discuss with her.

1048
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,210
- With whom? - Sorry?

1049
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,670
- With her. - Why?

1050
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,840
You must have something to do on the second floor.

1051
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,240
- Why? - Do you think we're that easy?

1052
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,110
Do you have to be on the second floor?

1053
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,470
- Can you give me some time? - Why?

1054
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,410
What's wrong with him?

1055
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,370
"What's wrong with him?"

1056
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,280
"What's wrong with him?"

1057
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,780
- Hey, Kwang Soo. - Save us.

1058
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,410
- Where are you going? - Kwang Soo.

1059
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,840
- I'm sorry. - Don't go.

1060
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,840
(Catch Kwang Soo.)

1061
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,280
(They power walk.)

1062
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:50,510
- Are you going to do this? - Don't.

1063
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,410
- Stick your hand in. - Okay.

1064
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,310
(He's cornered.)

1065
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,110
You can't.

1066
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:57,640
Please don't.

1067
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,810
Move. You can't.

1068
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,840
- Watch Irene. - This is no joke.

1069
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,040
This is the right timing. Attack.

1070
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,280
(Haha and Irene change their target to Jong Kook.)

1071
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,940
- Rip it. - You can't.

1072
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:13,210
(We're going to be the king.)

1073
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,710
(Ripping)

1074
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,070
Did you rip it?

1075
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,540
(Jong Kook and Seul Gi are eliminated.)

1076
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,740
- Rip it. - Ji Hyo.

1077
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:26,280
I stopped Kwang Soo even when he was biting me.

1078
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,410
(They are not listening.)

1079
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:29,740
I can't trust anybody.

1080
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,610
(Nobody is worth trusting.)

1081
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,070
Hold on.

1082
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,870
Everybody, please move.

1083
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,740
What did I do? This week is not my special.

1084
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,810
(Kwang Soo and Ye Ri are eliminated.)

1085
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,040
- My gosh. - Are you all right?

1086
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,240
- Oh, my goodness. - Her hair got ripped.

1087
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,470
- Are you all right? - Yes, I am.

1088
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,170
(2 teams are left.)

1089
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,540
- I hope you all fail. - Good job.

1090
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,670
(Only one team wins.)

1091
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:53,170
(Only the winning team gets 30 points.)

1092
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,240
- My gosh. - Good one.

1093
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,470
Good job, Irene.

1094
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,610
(It's Ji Hyo and Wendy versus Haha and Irene.)

1095
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,070
You can't do this, Haha.

1096
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:04,010
(Irene goes for it.)

1097
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,870
No way.

1098
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:07,240
Good job, Irene.

1099
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,470
Just rip it off.

1100
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:11,940
(Her hand reaches for the bracelet.)

1101
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,110
- You can't. - Did you get it?

1102
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:16,110
You did. Just grab it.

1103
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:19,280
(Ji Hyo and Wendy are eliminated.)

1104
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,040
I tried my best.

1105
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,310
We won!

1106
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:24,810
(Haha and Irene are the champions.)

1107
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:28,440
Jeju Island Mission, "Couple Race on Olle Trails".

1108
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,440
First place is Haha and Irene.

1109
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,910
Really?

1110
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,740
That wasn't nice.

1111
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:38,610
It's time to let Red Velvet go.

1112
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,070
- Why? - Why?

1113
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,770
Do they have to go?

1114
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:43,110
Yes.

1115
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:45,340
- We're sad to let them go. - We like them so much.

1116
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,940
We're sad to let them go.

1117
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:50,340
Running Man members will head to Santorini.

1118
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,970
- Santorini. - Santorini.

1119
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,840
- That sounds good. - Greece.

1120
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:57,710
- Thank you. - Let me use the restroom.

1121
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,340
- Can we? - I need to go.

1122
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:02,340
I'll quickly use the restroom.

1123
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,310
(Jae Seok disappears.)

1124
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,340
- See you later. - Thank you.

1125
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,340
See you again.

1126
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,970
That's Wendy.

1127
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:10,910
- Thank you. - Really?

1128
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:12,410
Thanks, guys.

1129
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:13,870
(Kwang Soo is focused on the album.)

1130
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:17,510
(Dashing)

1131
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:22,970
(He's busy completing his mission.)

1132
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,470
Hurry up, Kwon Ryeol.

1133
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,210
(I'm coming.)

1134
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,240
What number is it?

1135
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,370
(Where's Ji Hyo's locker room?)

1136
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:35,540
What number is it?

1137
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,940
(He left Ji Hyo's locker key with Kwon Ryeol.)

1138
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,140
Hurry.

1139
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:40,940
I'm done if they see me.

1140
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,910
Come out later. Be careful.

1141
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,270
- Were you born in 1999? - Yes, I'm 19.

1142
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:49,170
- You're still 19? - Yes, I am.

1143
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:51,270
- When did you make your debut? - I was 17.

1144
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:54,110
- When were you born? - In 1999.

1145
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,440
She was born in 1999?

1146
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,710
Yes, I was born in 1999.

1147
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,570
I got married that year.

1148
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:03,310
(Jae Seok is not returning from the restroom.)

1149
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:05,370
Where's Jae Seok?

1150
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,270
Jae Seok?

1151
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:08,640
(He's anxious.)

1152
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,670
Did the cameraman go with him?

1153
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:11,770
(He doesn't have a good feeling.)

1154
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,270
(Jae Seok has to get out of here as soon as possible.)

1155
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:16,340
1770.

1156
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:19,670
(Jae Seok has to get out of here as soon as possible.)

1157
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:22,470
(Here it is.)

1158
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:28,470
(Opening)

1159
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:30,070
I feel like a real thief.

1160
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:31,970
(This is quite thrilling.)

1161
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:33,640
(This is like the story "Fairy and the Wood Cutter".)

1162
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,370
I can't get caught while leaving.

1163
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:37,340
(This is like the story "Fairy and the Wood Cutter".)

1164
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:41,410
(He goes to the restroom to search for Jae Seok.)

1165
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,870
Jae Seok?

1166
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:47,040
(Jae Seok is definitely up to something.)

1167
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:48,970
I should go around.

1168
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:51,810
(All he has to do is deliver the clothes.)

1169
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,670
(Dashing)

1170
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:59,840
(Here are Ji Hyo's clothes.)

1171
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,040
Here they are.

1172
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,870
Yes, that's all.

1173
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:05,070
(He hands in Ji Hyo's clothes.)

1174
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:09,440
(He can't let it happen.)

1175
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:14,640
(He'll clear the mission only if he returns safely.)

1176
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:19,270
(He's furious with Jae Seok.)

1177
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:25,210
(What will happen to Jae Seok?)

1178
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,240
(Kwang Soo misses him by a split second.)

1179
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,540
Where's the women's locker room?

1180
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,310
Isn't he here?

1181
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:38,710
(He looks through the locker room only after the clothes go missing.)

1182
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,570
(Jae Seok returns with confidence.)

1183
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:45,840
Let's go.

1184
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:48,110
- Did you wash your hair? - Let's go.

1185
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,040
Wait a minute.

1186
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,010
(They say goodbye to Red Velvet.)

1187
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,070
What is it?

1188
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,970
(Kwang Soo ran for nothing.)

1189
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:58,110
My goodness, Kwang Soo.

1190
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,610
What are you doing? Where were you?

1191
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:02,570
Did you really go to the restroom?

1192
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,270
(It's by the Mediterranean and full of sunlight.)

1193
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:14,670
- My goodness. - Is this the place?

1194
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:15,810
Why is it called Santorini?

1195
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:18,040
It's quite hot in here.

1196
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,040
Kwang Soo, sit where you're supposed to.

1197
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,540
- That's right. - Take your assigned seating.

1198
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,210
- Is it here? - Stand up.

1199
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:24,440
He has his assigned seat.

1200
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,110
- Is it here? I'll move. - Stand up.

1201
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,910
He has his assigned seat.

1202
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:29,010
Please have a seat.

1203
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:30,510
- Have a seat, Kwang Soo. - I'll sit here.

1204
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:32,240
- Where will you sit? - I don't know.

1205
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,840
- Really? - There must be something here.

1206
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:36,440
- There's nothing here. - Kwang Soo.

1207
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,270
I feel bad for Kwang Soo today.

1208
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:39,940
Poor Kwang Soo.

1209
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,110
Everyone, it's been difficult for you.

1210
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:45,340
- Now is the time to take a rest. - That's great.

1211
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:48,540
- In Santorini, Greece, - Santorini...

1212
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:51,340
there's a tradition of napping, which is called "siesta".

1213
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,540
- I know what it is. - I'm sure you know.

1214
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:56,570
They take a nap when it's the hottest during the day.

1215
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:01,110
Since you're in Greece, you can take a "siesta".

1216
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,810
- May we sleep? - Yes, you may.

1217
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:04,410
Do we win the longer we stay here?

1218
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,240
I'll tell you once you lie down.

1219
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:09,040
- Kwang Soo is up to something. - Right.

1220
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,440
He'll do something again.

1221
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:13,340
(He's tired of defending himself.)

1222
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,970
- It's comfortable. - Gosh, this is great.

1223
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:18,370
- Please close your eyes. - Do we close them? Okay.

1224
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:19,610
Something will happen.

1225
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:24,540
- We must close them for Kwang Soo. - The first person...

1226
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:27,410
Be quiet.

1227
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,410
(Laughing)

1228
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:31,810
- Please leave me alone. - Okay.

1229
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:35,270
The first person to open their eyes...

1230
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:37,710
will be eliminated.

1231
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:39,640
It's time to meditate.

1232
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,710
- Do we sleep? - Yes.

1233
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:47,240
I wish Sistar would come during our "siesta".

1234
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,840
(Tired from a demanding race, the members try to sleep.)

1235
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,710
It's a good place to fall asleep.

1236
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:54,740
(He gets up suddenly.)

1237
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:57,270
(He waits for his chance.)

1238
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:03,440
(Kwang Soo secretly goes to the locker room.)

1239
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,340
(He hears something.)

1240
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:10,870
(While being clueless, Kwang Soo goes to Ji Hyo's locker room.)

1241
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:13,640
(He senses that Kwang Soo has left.)

1242
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,370
They didn't say anything about not getting caught.

1243
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,740
(He enters the women's locker room.)

1244
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,040
I don't care if I get caught...

1245
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,470
as long as it weighs a lot.

1246
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:26,410
Kwang Soo is making us sleep because he didn't do enough.

1247
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:28,040
Kwang Soo?

1248
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:30,640
- Is Kwang Soo here? - He's not here.

1249
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,010
He isn't.

1250
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,040
He left.

1251
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,770
He's being too obvious.

1252
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,270
Seven.

1253
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:41,140
Seven.

1254
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:44,640
(Everyone is sleeping in peace.)

1255
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:48,370
(He finds Ji Hyo's locker.)

1256
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:51,570
(The empty locker seems ominous.)

1257
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,370
(It's completely empty.)

1258
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:58,140
(It must be Jae Seok.)

1259
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:04,840
(Jae Seok already stole everything from Ji Hyo's locker.)

1260
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:07,070
I'm doomed, aren't I?

1261
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,210
(Yes, you're doomed.)

1262
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,370
Doesn't Kwang Soo...

1263
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,710
deserve some kind of punishment?

1264
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,270
Just go back to sleep.

1265
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,770
I'm so curious to find out.

1266
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,670
Open your eyes.

1267
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,140
Open your eyes and tell us.

1268
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,570
I can't open them first.

1269
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,740
- Are you sleeping, Seok Jin? - Seok Jin is good at this.

1270
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:34,240
How amazing. Kwang Soo came back.

1271
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,670
(Darn it.)

1272
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:38,710
- Is that so? - Can he do that?

1273
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:39,940
I just woke up.

1274
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:42,440
Can he reappear like that?

1275
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,410
He's trying to catch his breath.

1276
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,310
(Laughing)

1277
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,640
We can't let him do that.

1278
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:50,910
Gosh, I'm doomed.

1279
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:52,340
It's okay.

1280
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:55,070
(Ruffling sounds)

1281
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:57,470
Take a look over here.

1282
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,840
Take a look over here.

1283
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,010
I don't want to.

1284
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,210
I'm not buying it.

1285
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:05,170
I was so curious that I almost opened my eyes.

1286
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:06,740
Who is it?

1287
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:08,740
- Haha, you must see this. - Who is it?

1288
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,610
Wait, what if it's someone famous?

1289
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,110
- Is it a celebrity? - You must take a look.

1290
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,340
(Oh, my!)

1291
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:18,070
(Oh, my!)

1292
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:21,110
(Kwang Soo tries to trick the others.)

1293
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:22,670
Whose voice is it?

1294
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,810
(He opens his eyes.)

1295
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:25,840
(What's going on?)

1296
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:28,710
(It reads, "You're out.")

1297
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,810
- Who is it? - Hello.

1298
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:33,340
(Whoever opens their eyes is eliminated.)

1299
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,470
- What's going on? - Who is it?

1300
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,170
Jae Seok is eliminated.

1301
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:40,510
You couldn't wait, could you?

1302
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:43,170
Kwang Soo, you brat. Hey.

1303
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:44,970
I did a good job.

1304
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,610
This is the best thing I've done on this episode.

1305
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,870
I thought he saw someone.

1306
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:52,670
(Eliminating Jae Seok was the best thing he did.)

1307
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:53,870
My goodness.

1308
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:57,970
Jae Seok, please leave the room.

1309
00:51:57,970 --> 00:51:59,210
Is he leaving?

1310
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:01,710
I should put the beds together.

1311
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:03,910
Stop it. Stop it.

1312
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:07,940
You can't make me look by stealing from me.

1313
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:10,070
(He takes something out.)

1314
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:11,110
(Where are my points?)

1315
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:12,440
- Hey. - What's going on?

1316
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:15,140
Come on, you can't do this.

1317
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,440
Come on, don't take it.

1318
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,970
Did he steal your points?

1319
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,670
Hey.

1320
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:25,710
(You stole Ji Hyo's clothes, too.)

1321
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,070
(I'm taking you down with me.)

1322
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:30,140
It's a big mess over here.

1323
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:32,540
I feel like I'm being bewitched.

1324
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:34,670
Don't touch that.

1325
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:37,670
- I want to see what he's touching. - I'm curious.

1326
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:40,070
- Don't touch that. - What is he touching?

1327
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:43,670
Don't get fooled by what they're saying.

1328
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:46,010
(Seok Jin talks too much.)

1329
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:49,110
I won't open my eyes even if Jeon Do Yeon is here.

1330
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:51,010
I'm serious.

1331
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,840
(He spills something on him.)

1332
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,140
(He forces Seok Jin to open his eyes.)

1333
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:56,540
What's going on?

1334
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,640
- Jae Seok. - What are you doing?

1335
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,440
- Come on, he can't do that. - What happened?

1336
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:07,210
(Haha wants to see what's going on.)

1337
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:09,340
(Haha is eliminated.)

1338
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:12,370
I'm nervous. Tell the ones who are out to leave.

1339
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,810
- She opened her eyes. - She's out.

1340
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:19,510
(She's also curious to see the fight.)

1341
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:23,040
- What happened? - Jong Kook is the winner.

1342
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,070
(Jong Kook wins.)

1343
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:27,010
- He didn't open until the end. - It's incredible.

1344
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:30,340
Open your eyes. Please go to the last course.

1345
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:32,510
- It's the last. - There's another one?

1346
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:33,970
Did Kwang Soo clear his mission?

1347
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:39,410
- Only the last course remains. - What is it?

1348
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:42,640
You may go home after you finish this.

1349
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:47,610
(It's a chance for them to run away.)

1350
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:49,710
Go home right away?

1351
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:53,710
Change into your clothes and go back to where we opened the show.

1352
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:56,340
We don't have clothes, do we?

1353
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,040
(Look at Kwang Soo's face.)

1354
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,710
- We don't have clothes. - Look at him.

1355
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:01,170
His face completely changed.

1356
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,340
No, I just didn't understand when he said we could go home.

1357
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,510
Can we go home right after?

1358
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,710
Please go to the locker room to get changed.

1359
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:11,240
- What a surprise. - Yes.

1360
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,970
I'll act surprised.

1361
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:15,240
I'll act very surprised.

1362
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:18,540
The cameras are following us to catch our being surprised.

1363
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:23,610
(Everyone, I'll do better next time.)

1364
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:24,870
(They head to the locker room.)

1365
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:26,640
I will act surprised.

1366
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,910
(They're ready for the last mission.)

1367
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:30,610
I wonder what's waiting for us.

1368
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,710
How should I act surprised?

1369
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:37,140
(Jae Seok is very close to winning.)

1370
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,010
It's locker number 1731.

1371
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:43,740
(There's something inside.)

1372
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:44,740
What is it?

1373
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,610
- There's something here. - Kwang Soo.

1374
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:48,670
(Jong Kook acts surprised.)

1375
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:51,370
What is it? Goodness.

1376
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:55,140
"Your clothes are stolen. One of the members stole them."

1377
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:58,870
- "Within the time limit..." - "You must eliminate his name tag."

1378
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,110
"If not, you'll return home with the clothes from the sauna."

1379
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:04,370
"If the thieves are caught by the members..."

1380
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,210
(What?)

1381
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:11,170
(The thieves get their last mission.)

1382
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:14,410
(They win if they protect their name tags for 15 minutes.)

1383
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:18,270
(They must change into their clothes hidden on the second floor.)

1384
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:20,840
No one is surprised at all.

1385
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:23,540
(They must separate themselves from the others.)

1386
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:25,170
Has Kwang Soo gone far?

1387
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,210
Where's Kwang Soo?

1388
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:29,210
(Kwang Soo goes to get changed.)

1389
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:30,870
Where is Kwang Soo?

1390
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:32,870
We're leaving together.

1391
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,540
We're starting together.

1392
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:37,970
I'm in trouble.

1393
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:39,310
(It looks like Jae Seok is stuck with the other members.)

1394
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:40,910
I'm speechless.

1395
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:44,910
(I'll show you what hiding is about.)

1396
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:47,440
The clothes...

1397
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,710
They took the clothes.

1398
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:50,340
Everybody.

1399
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:52,240
You know, right?

1400
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,310
We don't even have to mention it.

1401
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:56,210
It's obvious.

1402
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:59,810
This is funny. It made me laugh.

1403
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:02,240
(He feels anxious while everybody's laughing.)

1404
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,470
- This is too funny. - I'm speechless.

1405
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,840
(They're relaxed.)

1406
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:09,210
- This is too funny. - Silence.

1407
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:11,440
Come on, Kwang Soo.

1408
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,840
(He keeps acting.)

1409
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:18,570
(Kwang Soo runs for his life.)

1410
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:20,040
I'm in trouble.

1411
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:24,170
Let's start hunting.

1412
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:27,040
Where could he be?

1413
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,340
If I were him, I'd go to the water park.

1414
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:31,770
(Bingo)

1415
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:32,840
Where am I?

1416
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,040
Please.

1417
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:37,210
Where do I go?

1418
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,740
Where am I? Hold on.

1419
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,240
Where am I? I have nowhere to run.

1420
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,540
(Kwang Soo is here.)

1421
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:49,570
I have to last only 15 minutes.

1422
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,340
(Sliding)

1423
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:58,710
(He decides to hide in the water slide for 15 minutes.)

1424
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:01,140
We have to run if we see them.

1425
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,210
Five, four...

1426
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:05,410
(Would they be able to survive for 15 minutes?)

1427
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:06,970
- This is easy. - One.

1428
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:09,340
This is too easy.

1429
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,340
("Catch the Thief" race starts now.)

1430
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,770
- Jong Kook. - Yes?

1431
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,510
Kwang Soo stole our clothes.

1432
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:18,070
- We have to catch him. - That's right.

1433
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,670
I'm not surprised. We weren't even surprised.

1434
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:23,310
- We only have 15 minutes. - That's why he took our clothes.

1435
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:24,340
I think he went far.

1436
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:27,570
I think he headed for the water park. I'll head that way.

1437
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:30,310
(They start looking for him on the 1st and 2nd floors.)

1438
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:32,970
He might be pretending to be a staff member.

1439
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:35,440
- Right. That's what I thought. - He could be.

1440
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:41,640
(Haha, Jong Kook, and Jae Seok look around the water park.)

1441
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:45,740
(Do your best to hide well.)

1442
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:48,540
This place is huge.

1443
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:53,170
Where should I go to change?

1444
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:57,710
I can't be here right now.

1445
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,510
(Meanwhile, here's Kwang Soo.)

1446
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:04,810
(He's right in the middle of the water slide.)

1447
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:06,870
I don't know where the middle is.

1448
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:12,070
The water slide...

1449
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,710
Could he be stuck in the middle?

1450
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,540
(Yes, that's possible.)

1451
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:24,510
(Jong Kook's hunch is scary.)

1452
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:28,140
Okay. I'll get through this.

1453
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:31,840
(Haha approaches the slide.)

1454
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,940
We're here. Where's...

1455
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,840
(Whose voice is that?)

1456
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:48,810
Don't shine the light that way.

1457
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:50,710
(He's enraged.)

1458
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:52,670
Do you want to die together?

1459
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,540
(I found Kwang Soo.)

1460
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:57,570
Hey.

1461
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,210
(I can't do this alone.)

1462
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,740
(Kwang Soo can't get caught already.)

1463
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:07,840
Where are you?

1464
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,770
(Startled)

1465
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:14,170
Turn off the light.

1466
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:17,670
What's wrong?

1467
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:19,610
(Assistance arrives.)

1468
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:21,310
He's in the slide.

1469
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:24,270
- I thought so, too. - He's in the slide. I heard him.

1470
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:28,710
(Kwang Soo's arrest is imminent.)

1471
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:31,210
(This is his only chance to escape.)

1472
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:34,310
Jae Seok.

1473
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:36,240
Jae Seok.

1474
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:37,970
Jae Seok.

1475
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:42,710
(Did Jong Kook find out about my identity?)

1476
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,070
Stay near the bottom of the slide.

1477
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:46,970
Stay near the bottom of the slide.

1478
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:48,810
(That was very close.)

1479
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:52,270
They're moving.

1480
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:56,610
(I can smell the thief close by.)

1481
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:02,110
Turn off the light. Turn it off completely.

1482
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,540
I'm sorry, viewers.

1483
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:07,440
You can't see anything, right?

1484
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,270
Give me a second.

1485
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,370
Kwang Soo!

1486
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:12,870
Kwang Soo!

1487
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:15,810
Turn off the camera. Turn it off.

1488
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:18,540
Haha, go to the bottom.

1489
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:19,540
Okay.

1490
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:22,040
(It's a mop-up operation to catch Kwang Soo.)

1491
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:27,440
(They seal the bottom, and Jong Kook will pressure him.)

1492
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,910
I hope he gets caught here.

1493
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:35,270
Somebody is trying to run away. He's running away.

1494
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:39,410
Hey. What happened?

1495
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:41,970
He's in here.

1496
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:43,210
(They miss Kwang Soo by a whisker.)

1497
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,270
Where did Jae Seok go?

1498
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,810
I told him to be at the bottom.

1499
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,610
(Jae Seok heads upstairs to get changed.)

1500
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,610
This is too scary.

1501
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:58,840
That was close.

1502
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,670
That was so close.

1503
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:03,310
- What happened? Is he gone? - He ran away.

1504
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:06,040
- Did you see him? - He was inside the slide.

1505
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:08,240
- Didn't you see him outside? - No.

1506
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,040
He's in here.

1507
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:12,940
(He's nervous.)

1508
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,310
(Glancing)

1509
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:23,810
(With 10 minutes left, Jae Seok finds his clothes.)

1510
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:27,010
Close the door.

1511
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,710
He wasn't near the top. He climbed from the bottom.

1512
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:33,610
- We almost had him. - He might be here.

1513
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:36,870
He probably panicked and just went in anywhere.

1514
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:38,940
That was so close.

1515
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:39,940
(You just wait.)

1516
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:41,040
We almost had him.

1517
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:42,410
(Where did he go?)

1518
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:45,910
Kwang Soo is here!

1519
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:48,340
Kwang Soo is here!

1520
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:50,610
Where? Where?

1521
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:54,140
- Where? - He's in the water.

1522
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:56,310
(They finally spot Kwang Soo.)

1523
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:58,410
Kwang Soo!

1524
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,940
I'm going to go down by myself.

1525
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:05,410
(Jong Kook and Haha started inching in on him.)

1526
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:10,940
(He slipped away with perfect timing.)

1527
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:12,970
He's running away.

1528
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:17,770
(He's careful and even removed his microphone.)

1529
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,610
He's running away.

1530
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:27,310
(I can't ruin today like this.)

1531
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:31,340
It's cold.

1532
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:35,140
(He left without a camera.)

1533
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:39,870
Go away. Don't film me.

1534
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:42,770
He's in the water.

1535
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:44,670
- In the water? - He's in the water?

1536
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:46,340
- The tube. - That way's faster.

1537
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:48,470
- Where? - I'll corner him.

1538
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:50,670
What are we supposed to do?

1539
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:52,140
He's here.

1540
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:54,610
(Here's the clothes thief.)

1541
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:55,840
Hi, Kwang Soo.

1542
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,340
- Don't come. It's really cold. - I think we have to go in.

1543
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,040
(She doesn't care.)

1544
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,640
(There's only 7 minutes left. There's no time to lose.)

1545
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:11,410
(She's no joke.)

1546
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:19,510
(He moves farther away. Would he manage to run again?)

1547
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:24,740
(Here's Jong Kook.)

1548
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:27,440
(Kwang Soo falls into danger.)

1549
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,840
(Ripping)

1550
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:31,810
(Sadly, he is eliminated.)

1551
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:33,740
Why did you make me come in here?

1552
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:36,310
(Justice prevails.)

1553
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:39,070
Why did you steal everybody's clothes? Come here.

1554
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:42,510
- Hey. - What's the time? We were close.

1555
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:44,040
I don't have extra underwear.

1556
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:46,940
It's five minutes before the race is over.

1557
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:48,970
The race is not over yet.

1558
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,840
(It's not over?)

1559
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:54,940
(There's another thief...)

1560
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:58,310
(who was plotting the perfect crime when nobody was looking.)

1561
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:00,040
Kwon Ryeol.

1562
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:02,340
They have no idea it's me...

1563
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:05,340
so you should stay away.

1564
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:10,070
(They had no idea Jae Seok was the thief.)

1565
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:12,870
It's Jae Seok.

1566
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:14,770
Everybody!

1567
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:17,240
We're Running Man!

1568
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,140
Let's do this!

1569
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:23,540
(There's not much time left.)

1570
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:28,310
(Jae Seok finds a hiding spot.)

1571
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:32,610
(He's urgent.)

1572
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:35,240
Don't film me.

1573
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:37,540
(He tells Kwon Ryeol to stay away.)

1574
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:43,040
(He hides underneath a stack of chairs.)

1575
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:45,670
(He springs up.)

1576
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,310
Don't film me.

1577
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,670
(Jae Seok spent all day committing a perfect crime.)

1578
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:54,510
(He can see the end of it.)

1579
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,410
(Catch Jae Seok.)

1580
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:02,470
Please.

1581
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:04,470
I'm so nervous.

1582
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,810
(Jong Kook approaches Jae Seok.)

1583
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:11,910
(His gaze fixes on the chairs.)

1584
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:16,840
(Is it Jong Kook? Please go on your way.)

1585
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:20,570
(He stares in Jae Seok's direction.)

1586
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:29,940
(Jong Kook can't look away for some reason.)

1587
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:35,110
(Will Jong Kook spot Jae Seok?)

1588
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:37,740
(He passes by.)

1589
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:42,340
(He is 1m away from Jae Seok, but he passes by.)

1590
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:44,840
(He hid well. Where did he hide?)

1591
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:48,110
(I'm safe.)

1592
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,540
I can't trust no one in this world.

1593
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:54,110
(They've been betrayed. They start speeding up their search.)

1594
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:02,810
(Wait! That's a familiar figure.)

1595
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:05,810
(Kwon Ryeol, don't film me.)

1596
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,810
(Thanks to Jae Seok, Kwon Ryeol started his Week.)

1597
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:11,710
Hey.

1598
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:13,340
Why didn't you follow Jae Seok?

1599
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,610
- Pardon? - What are you doing here?

1600
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:18,810
- I got hungry. - Forget that. Where is he?

1601
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:20,970
Hey. Where is he?

1602
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:23,610
You should be filming Jae Seok.

1603
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:24,770
Would you like an egg?

1604
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:27,140
Hold on. I think he might be around here.

1605
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:29,470
If you're not with him...

1606
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:30,870
(Kwon Ryeol, buy some time for me.)

1607
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:32,710
He must be somewhere here.

1608
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:36,770
Kwon Ryeol, you must be filming Jae Seok. What are you doing here?

1609
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:38,310
There's a door here.

1610
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:40,740
Hey. We might go home in this outfit.

1611
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:41,810
I'm so mad.

1612
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:45,410
(It's difficult to find his hideout since no one paid attention to him.)

1613
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:46,840
Where would he be?

1614
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,370
Jae Seok. You're seriously good.

1615
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:56,410
(It can't be. Is Seok Jin's voice getting closer?)

1616
01:06:56,410 --> 01:06:58,710
(He's desperate. Please go away.)

1617
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:05,240
(Will he be lucky and raid Jae Seok's hideout?)

1618
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:08,410
(He holds his breath.)

1619
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:12,770
(Jumping)

1620
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:14,040
Could he be underneath this?

1621
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:17,640
(As Seok Jin jumps, the pile of chairs shakes.)

1622
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:19,610
Could he be underneath this?

1623
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:21,510
What? There's a hat.

1624
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:23,770
What? There's a hat.

1625
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:26,270
(Is he referring to this hat?)

1626
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:27,670
(Smiling)

1627
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:32,610
(He's caught.)

1628
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:36,370
He's here. He's here!

1629
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:40,040
(He faces the biggest crisis 30 seconds before it ends.)

1630
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:41,440
Where?

1631
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:43,910
(Haha and Ji Hyo join.)

1632
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:44,940
Hold him.

1633
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:47,040
He's here. What do you mean I should be quiet?

1634
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:48,440
Come here!

1635
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:50,410
- Come here. - I only have to hold out a minute.

1636
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:51,940
- I just need a minute. - Hold him.

1637
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:53,310
- Hold him. - This is it.

1638
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:56,010
- I only need a minute. - We have only a minute left.

1639
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:58,610
- It's less than a minute. - Hey. Move aside.

1640
01:07:58,610 --> 01:08:00,210
- It's not even a minute. - My goodness.

1641
01:08:00,270 --> 01:08:01,770
Quickly. Move in.

1642
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:03,740
- In 1, 2... - Get him up.

1643
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:04,840
In 1, 2...

1644
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:06,810
One minute.

1645
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,010
I got it.

1646
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:10,310
(Time's up.)

1647
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:13,070
Did it end?

1648
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:15,080
- Is it over? - Is it?

1649
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:16,340
Time's over.

1650
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:18,440
(Jae Seok miraculously accomplishes his mission.)

1651
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,580
We didn't get to remove it.

1652
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:22,470
(They are disappointed. Is it really over?)

1653
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:23,610
I'm so angry.

1654
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:24,640
(This is the perfect crime.)

1655
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,940
Do you know what he said when I found him?

1656
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:28,770
"Quiet." Why would I keep quiet?

1657
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:31,580
(The members were fooled the entire day.)

1658
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:33,580
If he lies down on his back, I wouldn't have had any shot at it.

1659
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:34,640
I made it.

1660
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:36,670
Were you here all along?

1661
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:38,540
I passed by and wondered if you were here.

1662
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:42,080
- I looked at it. - You should've come here.

1663
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,740
(Trudging)

1664
01:08:45,210 --> 01:08:46,540
- Kwang Soo. - Did you get his name tag?

1665
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:48,640
Did you remove his name tag?

1666
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,080
- No, I couldn't. Jae Seok hid well. - You look mad.

1667
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:52,870
- I guess they were the thieves. - I'm sorry.

1668
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:54,210
Kwang Soo, I am sorry.

1669
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:55,870
(You took advantage of me?)

1670
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:58,040
Kwang Soo, I am sorry. I apologize.

1671
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,610
(The punishment for failing the mission will be revealed soon.)

1672
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,340
Kwang Soo. I am sorry.

1673
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:03,970
(The week of rest ends.)

1674
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:06,510
It's been a while since I've done well after the spy episode.

1675
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:07,840
(He's proud.)

1676
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,080
(Slapping)

1677
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:12,010
(Are you happy that you won?)

1678
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:13,370
Kwang Soo helped him win.

1679
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:15,710
- Seriously. - If you didn't do what you did...

1680
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:17,840
I think I have to get a health check after the shoot.

1681
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,910
- Why? - I've been so stressed out...

1682
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:21,670
the entire day.

1683
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:22,910
Today,

1684
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:25,510
it was a week of rest.

1685
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:30,170
Ji Hyo, who was the most well-rested member of all, has earned a trip...

1686
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:32,770
- to South East Asia. - Really?

1687
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,610
- Is this real? - I have?

1688
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:37,610
- How can she be so lucky? - Are you serious?

1689
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:41,970
The hidden race, "Steal Their Clothes",

1690
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:44,640
- goes to Jae Seok. - You're right.

1691
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:47,270
Congratulations.

1692
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:49,010
- Isn't there a prize? - Is that it?

1693
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:50,410
This is it.

1694
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:52,210
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1695
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:53,610
- Hold on. - Congratulations.

1696
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:55,140
Congratulations.

1697
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:56,810
I'm no match for him.

1698
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:58,340
Congratulations.

1699
01:09:58,340 --> 01:09:59,740
- Goodness. - What a performance.

1700
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:00,910
Come on. Are you serious?

1701
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:04,270
- Jae Seok is the winner of the day. - He's great.

1702
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:05,870
We will return your clothes now.

1703
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:08,610
Clothes only Kwang Soo stole will be returned.

1704
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:10,840
(Since he lost the race, clothes only he stole will be returned.)

1705
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:12,010
It's because he got caught.

1706
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:13,810
- You stole my clothes. - Nice. I'll get my clothes.

1707
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,240
(I almost had Jae Seok.)

1708
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:19,170
I knew I only had to catch Kwang Soo.

1709
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:20,470
Cross!

1710
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:22,640
- I knew it. - This is making me so angry.

1711
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:26,910
Seok Jin and Ji Hyo, who didn't retrieve their clothes,

1712
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:29,210
will go home as they're dressed.

1713
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:31,970
- We have our clothes! - Yes, we do!

1714
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:33,580
Thank goodness we caught him!

1715
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:35,770
Kwang Soo lost the race.

1716
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:37,940
- Is there a punishment? - As it's the Year of the Rooster,

1717
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:40,040
- we've prepared a rooster costume. - It's a rooster.

1718
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,210
(It will catch everyone's eyes.)

1719
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:44,170
(The rooster costume was made manually.)

1720
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:45,910
- Where is it? - It's the red rooster!

1721
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:48,810
It's a continuation of last year's monkey costume.

1722
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:54,740
(In 2016, he started the Year of the Monkey with this outfit.)

1723
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:58,940
(What sort of an eyesore will he present this year?)

1724
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:01,970
It's the same one. Instead of monkeys, they are roosters.

1725
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:04,870
Try the shoes on.

1726
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:06,470
This is heavy.

1727
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:10,080
(Even the shoes crow. Many roosters are on the costume.)

1728
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,310
Look at that.

1729
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,580
(Laughing)

1730
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,270
(What kind of a punishment is this?)

1731
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,440
- It's cute. - The roosters cry so weirdly.

1732
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,640
(Seok Jin, Ji Hyo, and Kwang Soo go to a nearby train station.)

1733
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:24,540
- This is so embarrassing. - It's embarrassing.

1734
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:25,970
It's freezing.

1735
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:28,580
- How can you be embarrassed? - Be quiet.

1736
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:31,240
- I said to be quiet. - You're wearing a shirt and shorts.

1737
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:34,210
People are starting to gather around us.

1738
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:36,140
- It's a road. My goodness. - I'm starting to see people.

1739
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,010
It's a road.

1740
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:40,370
- They're starting to stare at us. - They're staring because of you.

1741
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:43,170
- Try to keep quiet. - You should be quiet.

1742
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:46,340
Let it go. I will give it to you later.

1743
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:47,940
I will give it to you later.

1744
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,340
- Ma'am. - Sir.

1745
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:52,440
- Please take one. - It's for the Year of the Rooster.

1746
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,810
- Take one please. - Here you go.

1747
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:55,610
- You can take one. - Happy New Year.

1748
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:57,240
You can just yank it out from him.

1749
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:59,470
I will allow it. You can pull one out.

1750
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:03,080
Hold on. What are you doing?

1751
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:04,610
Wait. Why are you pulling it out?

1752
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,170
Hold on. Why did you do that?

1753
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:07,540
Let's cross here.

1754
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:09,140
- You can take one. - It's for the Year of the Rooster.

1755
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:10,440
Am I a display shelf?

1756
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:14,940
(The Giving Tree, Kwang Soo, gives away roosters and receives love.)

1757
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:16,640
Hold on.

1758
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:18,270
(Pulling)

1759
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:21,170
(He's willing to give everything.)

1760
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,240
(He's embarrassed all of a sudden.)

1761
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:26,410
It's freezing. We're almost there.

1762
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:27,740
(Is the rooster crowing or is he crying?)

1763
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:29,940
This is better.

1764
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:31,610
(They've reached a nearby train station.)

1765
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:33,740
We have arrived.

1766
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:35,040
We are here. Can we go now?

1767
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:37,740
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

1768
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:40,040
I won't burgle anymore.

1769
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,670
I didn't steal them...

1770
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:43,740
- because I needed them. - Hey, you.

1771
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,610
- Everyone. Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

1772
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:47,910
All right. Let's hurry.

1773
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:49,110
- I'm freezing. - I'm embarrassed.

1774
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:51,440
(The members made the best out of the week of rest.)

1775
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,710
This is Running Man's Member's Week.

1776
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:55,370
(Member's Week)

1777
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:56,770
(The 6th host is...)

1778
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:57,910
(Yu Jae Seok.)

1779
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:00,010
This is Jae Seok's Sports Day.

1780
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:03,580
(We are Jae Seok's friends. We've been waiting for this day.)

1781
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:04,810
(Lee Chun Hee, Heo Kyung Hwan, KCM)

1782
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:11,110
(They are stronger and more determined than Jae Seok.)

1783
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:18,410
(Their top-notch performance dominates the members.)

1784
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:21,370
(And)

1785
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:24,110
(What is the element of surprise behind their performance?)

1786
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:27,010
(Jae Seok's Sports Day)
