1
00:00:04,749 --> 00:00:07,649
It's Running Man Member's Week.

2
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:09,779
(The sixth member is...)

3
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:10,909
(Yu Jae Seok.)

4
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:14,749
(Jae Seok's week offers more than any other member's week.)

5
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:16,979
(Kim Yong Man, Kim Won Hee, Lee Chun Hee, Heo Kyeong Hwan, KCM)

6
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:20,349
(Jae Seok's strong friends have come to teach the members a lesson.)

7
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:21,849
Don't tense up.

8
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:24,879
(This is a very large scale battle.)

9
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:29,279
(It's an Olympics with fun, sports, songs, and talks.)

10
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:30,709
(However,)

11
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:34,479
(if you aim for the throne, watch your back.)

12
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,979
(There is a secret hidden inside.)

13
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:40,809
(What is the secret surrounding Jae Seok?)

14
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:45,609
(The entertainment industry is focusing on this big event of 2017.)

15
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:48,379
(It's a special day with special guests.)

16
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,109
What is this?

17
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:52,679
It's Yu Jae Seok's Member's Week.

18
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:55,009
You are here as his friends.

19
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:56,449
(These five friends will help him.)

20
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:58,479
We are the people that have some connections to him.

21
00:00:58,679 --> 00:00:59,949
What are you saying?

22
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:01,079
(Don't pretend like you didn't know.)

23
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,349
- I'm just saying. - They...

24
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:04,479
called the obvious people.

25
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,579
- What is he trying to do? - I was explaining just in case.

26
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:10,049
- You are still being mean. - I know.

27
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,049
I think Jae Seok was thinking about...

28
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,419
how he could match us with the Running Man members.

29
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:19,109
There's no one other than KCM who can challenge Jong Kook.

30
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,979
I know Chun Hee will be in charge of Kwang Soo.

31
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:24,609
- That's right. - Yes.

32
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:28,079
I am always in charge of Kwang Soo or Seok Jin.

33
00:01:28,779 --> 00:01:29,809
How about you?

34
00:01:29,809 --> 00:01:31,649
I'll take care of Seok Jin.

35
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:32,709
(Leave Seok Jin to me.)

36
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:34,049
I'll take care of him.

37
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,449
He is quite strong, though.

38
00:01:35,449 --> 00:01:38,009
- He is? For him, his legs... - That's true.

39
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:40,109
I do have strong legs because I play soccer.

40
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:42,149
- I was going to say they are weak. - Really?

41
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,109
- I did play a lot of soccer. - But you miss a lot.

42
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:48,579
(These members were invited by this man.)

43
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,549
(Jae Seok is the main member today.)

44
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:51,709
What's over there?

45
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:52,749
(He enters first as the main MC.)

46
00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:55,079
Lee Seul started the job in her early 20s.

47
00:01:55,779 --> 00:01:57,849
As Jae Seok wished, there will be an entertaining sports game...

48
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:00,649
between Team Running Man and Team Friends today.

49
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:03,649
The winner will get to receive the prize he promised.

50
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,579
However...

51
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:08,579
However, there is a hidden rule...

52
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:10,509
that Jae Seok doesn't know about.

53
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:13,179
(Is there a secret on Jae Seok's Sports Day?)

54
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:16,709
I mentioned that the winner gets the prize...

55
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:18,249
he promised for each round.

56
00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:19,679
- Right. - So there are prizes?

57
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:23,479
In each prize, there will be hidden hints.

58
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:28,479
They are about the location of the last prize which is a treasure.

59
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,179
The team that finds the treasure first wins.

60
00:02:33,179 --> 00:02:34,249
Are we a team?

61
00:02:34,249 --> 00:02:37,179
Yes. However, if you are clumsy...

62
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:40,379
and Jae Seok finds the hints and the treasure first,

63
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:43,279
he gets to win alone.

64
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:47,379
(It's important to get as many hints as possible without his knowing.)

65
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,449
The scale is different for Jae Seok's Week.

66
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,109
- I knew it. - It's Jangchung Gymnasium.

67
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:58,309
It's my Member's Week today.

68
00:02:58,309 --> 00:03:00,049
I realized that...

69
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:03,549
we had too many touching...

70
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:06,109
- and teary episodes. - Why not?

71
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:08,779
- I really liked it. - There were...

72
00:03:08,779 --> 00:03:11,049
too many episodes like that.

73
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:13,309
So I told the staff that I wanted my episode...

74
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:14,849
- To be fun? - to be fun.

75
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:17,709
- I wanted to spend a happy day. - Okay.

76
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:20,179
That's why I decided to buy the prizes...

77
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:21,849
with my own money.

78
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:24,579
- Really? - There is one for each round.

79
00:03:25,149 --> 00:03:26,679
- I bought them with my own money. - Really?

80
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:27,949
- Yes. - Really?

81
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:31,449
I brought my friends that could be matches with...

82
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:35,649
- each of the Running Man members. - Really? I like that.

83
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,509
Please welcome, Team Friends!

84
00:03:39,649 --> 00:03:40,979
Who is that?

85
00:03:41,749 --> 00:03:43,849
- It's Yong Man. - What is he doing here?

86
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:45,349
It's Yong Man.

87
00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:47,309
(It's the Fantastic Five, armed with wit and experience.)

88
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:49,609
- It's Chun Hee. - And KCM.

89
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,049
It's KCM.

90
00:03:51,249 --> 00:03:52,279
Oh my!

91
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:53,779
- Hello. - Hello.

92
00:03:53,779 --> 00:03:55,849
- Hello. - Thank you for coming.

93
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:58,409
- Hello. It's been a long time. - KCM is here.

94
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:00,909
- Hello. - Hello.

95
00:04:01,749 --> 00:04:03,509
Put this away.

96
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:06,709
- KCM, it's been a long time. - Hello.

97
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:08,679
It's been a long time.

98
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:09,709
(Here are the five friends.)

99
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:11,549
They rented a gymnasium.

100
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:13,379
It's incredible.

101
00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:16,409
It's the unforgettable two-shot from...

102
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:18,079
"Mystic TV: Surprise."

103
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,179
(They used to emcee together.)

104
00:04:19,179 --> 00:04:20,649
I was in that program as well.

105
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,049
- For 6 weeks. - For 6 weeks.

106
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:24,409
- "Surprise". - It's incredible.

107
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:27,649
- "Come to Play". - "Come to Play".

108
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:29,509
- There is "Jagiya", too. - Okay.

109
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:32,049
- "Jagiya". - "Jagiya".

110
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:33,849
The show is still broadcasting until now...

111
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:35,709
but there was a little problem.

112
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:37,579
There was.

113
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,849
- It just happened. - He's not coming back.

114
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:42,879
- He isn't. - No.

115
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:46,449
Let me introduce them one by one.

116
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:48,749
The rival of Seok Jin is...

117
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:51,409
- Kim Yong Man. - Thank you.

118
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:53,149
Hello.

119
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:54,709
- It's been a long time. - It's been a long time.

120
00:04:54,749 --> 00:04:55,909
It's been a long time.

121
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,349
- I laughed when I was cast. - Why?

122
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,009
I knew I'm not a match for Jong Kook...

123
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,779
but I thought I could be a match for Kwang Soo or Haha.

124
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,509
Why did it have to be him?

125
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:07,149
- It was like that before. - He's quite strong.

126
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:09,209
After doing Running Man, he was given a new lease on life.

127
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,349
- I know. - What are you talking about?

128
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:13,049
How would you know?

129
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:14,979
- He was. - How would you know?

130
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:18,749
Yong Man is used to being an MC in a studio.

131
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:21,309
I have returned after a long break.

132
00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:23,949
I had doubts about Running Man at first, but I came because...

133
00:05:24,179 --> 00:05:26,149
they told me we were shooting under a roof.

134
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:27,949
We are shooting under a roof.

135
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:30,849
- And it's a huge roof. - At least, there's a roof.

136
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:32,149
It's almost like we're outdoors.

137
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:35,749
The most important factor for him is not how much he gets paid.

138
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:37,779
- It's the existence of a roof. - Is it the roof?

139
00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:39,949
It's whether or not there is a roof.

140
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:42,649
Yong Man will be...

141
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:46,149
the leader of Team Friends.

142
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,479
Who do you think is the weakest in your team?

143
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,679
It's Chun Hee, of course.

144
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,849
He seems like the weakest.

145
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:53,879
- He has that aura. - Totally.

146
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:56,509
He's confident because he has a lot of experience.

147
00:05:56,509 --> 00:05:59,649
- He does. - I saw the episodes and he's weak.

148
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:01,449
He doesn't do anything.

149
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:05,779
He did seem uncertain about his past battles with Kwang Soo.

150
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:09,149
He admits to losing. But...

151
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:12,249
- he's grinding his teeth today. - In "Family Outing",

152
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:14,209
- there was a famous incident... - Right.

153
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:16,779
where he washed radish with soap.

154
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:20,409
(November 2, 2008, Episode 20 from "Family Outing")

155
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:22,249
(What is this?)

156
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,209
(Is it soap?)

157
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:26,649
Chun Hee!

158
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:29,779
(Puzzled)

159
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:33,779
- Really? - It was my first day on the show.

160
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:35,749
- That can happen. - With soap?

161
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:38,379
As you know well enough,

162
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:40,979
the next contestant will be in rivalry with...

163
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:42,649
Song Ji Hyo.

164
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,649
It's Kim Won Hee.

165
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:46,779
- Kim Won Hee. - It's Won Hee!

166
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:48,079
- Look at her. - Kim Won Hee.

167
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,049
(The queen of variety shows declares war.)

168
00:06:51,049 --> 00:06:52,809
- Look at her. - Look.

169
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:54,549
- You can't lose. - Look at her.

170
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:55,579
It's just as expected.

171
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:58,109
She's the first generation of female entertainers.

172
00:06:58,109 --> 00:06:59,979
She opened up a new world.

173
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:01,749
- She's like Lee Seong Gye. - Lee Seong Gye?

174
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:04,879
- The first king of Joseon Dynasty. - Stop teasing her.

175
00:07:05,109 --> 00:07:06,709
Kyung Hwan is...

176
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:08,979
- watching out for a chance. - He's really small.

177
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:11,549
I chose the wrong place. They are too tall for me.

178
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:13,709
I am hidden by them.

179
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:15,679
It's driving me crazy.

180
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:18,849
This was supposed to be...

181
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:20,879
a team game.

182
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:23,309
But you all try to stand out.

183
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,779
We have to survive.

184
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,609
There is no team work.

185
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:28,579
- This could be the last chance. - We're all under pressure.

186
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:30,879
And they say things as to...

187
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,849
stand out.

188
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:35,409
- Let's control ourselves. - Let us.

189
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,779
- Do you mean it? - Yes, I do.

190
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:39,279
- Go. - Go.

191
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,649
- Go. - Go.

192
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:42,049
- Go Team Friends. - Go Team Friends.

193
00:07:42,049 --> 00:07:43,809
- It's really old-fashioned. - It's really old-fashioned.

194
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:46,179
We didn't even do that on "X-Man".

195
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:48,749
- Who made that? - We did that decades ago.

196
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:52,349
I only helped Chun Hee make the slogan.

197
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:55,309
- All right. First, Kyung Hwan, - What's our slogan?

198
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:58,909
when you are in rivalry with Haha...

199
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:01,249
- Please listen to me. - Okay.

200
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:03,149
- We're making our slogan. - We don't want to.

201
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,549
- Let's make one. - Why?

202
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:06,909
He's envying our slogan.

203
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:09,079
- Yes. - Seok Jin always makes one.

204
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,349
- He'll make one today. - One important fact is...

205
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:14,279
that Seok Jin is not the leader of this team unlike Yong Man is.

206
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,749
Why not?

207
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:17,609
- Jong Kook is the leader. - Why?

208
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:20,549
There's hierarchy here.

209
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:23,379
- We respect him because he's old. - You're not the leader here.

210
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:26,579
It's not well-balanced then. The balance has tipped.

211
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:28,949
You should change places.

212
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,749
The balance is tipped.

213
00:08:31,049 --> 00:08:33,009
- Here... - Age doesn't play a role.

214
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:34,679
It's best to clear any confusion.

215
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,179
No. You are not the leader.

216
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,379
- No, you are not. - We should clarify it first.

217
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:38,909
- You are such a great host. - Goodness.

218
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,649
The time has finally come.

219
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:43,409
- Goodness. - It's been a while.

220
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,879
I thought about who could be a suitable match for Jong Kook.

221
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:49,249
- There was only one person, KCM. - It's KCM.

222
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:51,609
(KCM, who has a sweet voice, visits a variety show after a long time.)

223
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:55,719
I thought KCM had a cast on his arm.

224
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,219
Isn't that a cast?

225
00:08:57,219 --> 00:08:59,149
It's an arm warmer, a leading fashion accessory.

226
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,449
- Why did you put it on? - Long time ago,

227
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:02,509
when he was actively starring on TV shows,

228
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,449
he wore arm warmers with sleeveless shirts.

229
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:07,909
I haven't seen it outside of billiard parlors.

230
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:10,509
This is my first time seeing it outside.

231
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:13,949
I have prepared something to compete against Jong Kook.

232
00:09:13,949 --> 00:09:15,009
- What is it? - What have you prepared?

233
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:17,649
(They're matching arm warmers.)

234
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:20,679
- Let's wear them together. - Let's not. I don't wear them.

235
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,649
- I have prepared them for you. - I don't want to wear them.

236
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:23,949
- You should try them on. - Stop it.

237
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:26,079
- Take off your parka. - He can wear them over.

238
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:27,609
- What's happening? - Wear them over the parka.

239
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,349
- I've prepared them for him. - Where's the sleeveless shirt?

240
00:09:30,349 --> 00:09:33,049
- Why do I have to wear them? - He even sewed them.

241
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:35,309
- I made them in a hurry. - It's driving me crazy.

242
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,449
You made holes here.

243
00:09:38,609 --> 00:09:39,809
(They look stylish and warm.)

244
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:40,849
You look scary.

245
00:09:40,849 --> 00:09:43,409
- You two should stand together. - What is this?

246
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:45,079
My goodness.

247
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:47,909
(These arm warmers will make you a professional billiard player.)

248
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:51,009
KCM, can't you imitate Jong Kook when he sings?

249
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:53,149
- Of course, I can. - You can, right?

250
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:55,079
- Can you sing a bit? - I was the first to imitate him,

251
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:57,049
but a lot of people started imitating.

252
00:09:57,049 --> 00:09:59,079
- Can you sing for a bit? - I am so curious.

253
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:00,179
Sing, "One Man".

254
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:03,449
There is one man

255
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:06,219
- I think his pitch is off. - He's out of tune.

256
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:07,249
Can you sing?

257
00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:08,409
Show us the original.

258
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:09,609
There is

259
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,719
- One man - He's trying to sound different.

260
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:16,549
- He sang it differently. - No, I didn't.

261
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:17,909
That's low even for you.

262
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,219
- You should've matched his singing. - I didn't sing it differently.

263
00:10:20,409 --> 00:10:22,509
- I mean KCM... - There is one man

264
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:23,679
- That's it. - He sounds exactly like Jong Kook.

265
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:26,049
Who loves you very much

266
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:27,909
- It sounds exactly like the CD. - You think so?

267
00:10:27,979 --> 00:10:29,109
- Is that the right pitch? - He doesn't sound like me.

268
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:30,379
Try again.

269
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:32,409
- There is one man - There he goes again.

270
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:35,179
(Even before listening, she criticizes him.)

271
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:36,979
- Exactly. - What are you talking about?

272
00:10:36,979 --> 00:10:38,309
He's the original singer.

273
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:40,949
- KCM should match his singing. - Why do I have to match him?

274
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:43,879
- KCM was supposed to imitate him. - He did a fine job.

275
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:47,579
Why don't we start now? Why don't we start with an applause?

276
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:48,679
(The match begins.)

277
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,179
The first round is a battle of rivalry.

278
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:56,679
We have prepared a triathlon for...

279
00:10:57,409 --> 00:10:59,079
- men of strength. - Men of strength?

280
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:01,249
Who do you think suits the description?

281
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:02,749
- They are Jong Kook and KCM. - It must be Jong Kook.

282
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:05,479
(It's a battle of power. It's Jong Kook against KCM.)

283
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:07,279
- Are you going to be okay? - We get to see this at last.

284
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,949
Look at his body. He has a good build.

285
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:10,609
- They're bringing in something. - Goodness.

286
00:11:10,609 --> 00:11:12,079
- It's arm-wrestling. - They're really going to play it?

287
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,679
He must be good at arm-wrestling.

288
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:15,879
- I can't predict who will win. - Me, neither.

289
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,109
(It's a chance to scare off the other team.)

290
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:20,309
(Jong Kook is a true man of strength and a symbol of power.)

291
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:24,549
(He's an exceptional arm-wrestler who won against 52 people in a row.)

292
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:28,709
(KCM is the only match among the celebrities to compete against him.)

293
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:32,049
(He will knock him out with unusual power and exercise capability.)

294
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:34,149
(Who will be the victor of the first battle?)

295
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:36,149
I am really curious to find out the result.

296
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:37,779
- They are really going to do it. - This is amazing.

297
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:40,609
- Show him. - The pride of athletes is at stake.

298
00:11:40,609 --> 00:11:42,009
This will be quite a match.

299
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:45,609
Both of you are known to work out a lot.

300
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:48,049
You two are considered to be really strong.

301
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,649
Why don't you sing your songs...

302
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:52,979
in order to vanquish your opponents?

303
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,809
You can sing the highlight of your songs.

304
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:56,009
Jong Kook, go first.

305
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:59,349
There is one man

306
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:02,349
Who loves you very much

307
00:12:02,349 --> 00:12:03,679
- You love me? - All right.

308
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:04,849
It's your turn.

309
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:08,549
- Should I say I love you again? - They sound the same.

310
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:11,909
- Should I wait a bit more? - I haven't heard it for so long.

311
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,749
Can you sing one more song? Sing one more.

312
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:20,109
A day passes by, a month passes by

313
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:23,549
(Somehow, they are getting a bit too emotional.)

314
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:25,809
Both of their songs are so sentimental.

315
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:29,749
- They have similar voices. - It feels weird to sing right now.

316
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,809
This was supposed to distract your opponent.

317
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:36,279
Why don't you grab the stick? Get ready.

318
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:39,509
- Please move to my side. - Goodness. He's strong.

319
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,649
(They can feel each other's power just by holding each other's hand.)

320
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:43,409
Get ready. Please move to the side.

321
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:45,209
- I am so curious. - Shouldn't someone grab the table?

322
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:46,879
- They are so serious. - Let me hold the table.

323
00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:48,209
- Ready. - Goodness, KCM.

324
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:49,479
- It will be just one round. - You'll play only one game.

325
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:51,479
- Their pride is at stake. - This is...

326
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,309
- It will light up. - It's quite a rare scene to watch.

327
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:55,009
- Yes, it is a rare scene. - This is my first time seeing it.

328
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:57,209
- KCM, show him what you've got. - Get ready.

329
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,649
(Who will take the first win?)

330
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:02,249
(Will it be KCM with arm warmers that will increase his offense?)

331
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:04,849
(Or will it be Jong Kook who has a great defense?)

332
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:07,879
(It's a battle of their pride as they work out at the gym zealously.)

333
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,179
(Start!)

334
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:13,209
(From the start, they go hard at each other.)

335
00:13:15,849 --> 00:13:16,909
(He clenches his teeth.)

336
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:17,979
This is...

337
00:13:19,109 --> 00:13:22,649
(At that moment, the momentum of the game seems to change.)

338
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:26,209
(To whose side will the arms go down?)

339
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,409
This is..

340
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:29,879
(Pulling)

341
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:31,649
This is...

342
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:33,579
(Jong Kook is shocked.)

343
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:37,609
(Will KCM be able to win?)

344
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:42,549
- KCM has won. KCM won. - It's over.

345
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:46,409
(KCM, the father of arm warmers, wins.)

346
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,309
(The score is 0 to 1.)

347
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:51,109
- Are you okay? - Jong Kook is strong, too.

348
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:52,879
(It's been years since he lost in a strength battle.)

349
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,709
- This can't be right. - This can't be happening.

350
00:13:55,749 --> 00:13:57,279
- I can't believe this. - This must be a dream.

351
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,509
He's really strong.

352
00:13:58,509 --> 00:13:59,609
(What will be the second battle?)

353
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,979
- We'll start the next battle. - It's thigh wrestling.

354
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:06,909
- Jong Kook's thighs are amazing. - This won't be easy.

355
00:14:06,909 --> 00:14:08,309
- It's easier if he... - Here we go again.

356
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:09,609
Sit closer.

357
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:11,479
- This is nice. - This won't be the same.

358
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:14,749
(Jong Kook's thighs are like steel.)

359
00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:17,509
(He overpowered Kim Dong Hyun, an MMA fighter.)

360
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:22,949
(He even had a neck and neck battle with Choi Shin Soo.)

361
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:26,609
(It's the ultimate pride of muscular athletes, iron-like thighs.)

362
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:27,679
- Goodness. - He's so strong.

363
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:30,079
It's easier to split the legs.

364
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,349
Should I play defense first?

365
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:32,949
You can play defense first.

366
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:34,149
(It won't be easy this time.)

367
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:36,179
Please check the time.

368
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:38,279
- Ready. - The camera...

369
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,649
(Jong Kook will play defense and KCM will play offense.)

370
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:40,849
Offense is harder.

371
00:14:40,849 --> 00:14:42,579
(Thigh wrestling starts!)

372
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:44,379
Hold the chairs.

373
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:46,109
- Goodness. - Check the time.

374
00:14:46,109 --> 00:14:48,909
(If he holds KCM's legs together for 15 seconds, he wins.)

375
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:50,649
- They have 10 seconds left. - Are you timing it?

376
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:51,909
- For KCM to compete with him... - They have 10 seconds?

377
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:53,079
- Only 10 seconds left. -10 seconds?

378
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:55,179
(If KCM splits Jong Kook's legs in 15 seconds, he wins.)

379
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:58,479
For KCM to compete with him is amazing.

380
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:01,309
(They are amazed at KCM and respect him at the same time.)

381
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,309
10 seconds left.

382
00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:04,979
(They won't give in.)

383
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:06,209
This is impossible.

384
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:13,549
(Jong Kook finally meets a suitable match today.)

385
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:14,679
Time's up.

386
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:19,479
- Look at his face. It's so red. - Good job.

387
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:21,809
- You have a runny nose. - All you have to do is hold out.

388
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:24,509
- My legs are about to fall off. - You just have to withstand him.

389
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:25,679
How was it?

390
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:27,949
I felt like I was going against a rock.

391
00:15:28,609 --> 00:15:30,509
Your legs are not fixed, are they?

392
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:33,309
We will switch positions now. KCM will play defense.

393
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:34,449
This is so challenging.

394
00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:36,479
- It will be another 15 seconds. - It will last for 15 seconds.

395
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:38,279
- Get ready. - He has to play defense now?

396
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:42,049
I bet they worked out more than all of us combined.

397
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:43,609
- That's true. - They do work out a lot.

398
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,049
Ready. Jong Kook.

399
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:46,849
- Playing offense is harder. - It is.

400
00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:48,549
It will be tied if KCM wins, right?

401
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:50,709
Yes, it will be even. Get ready.

402
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:52,409
You can do it.

403
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,509
(Thigh wrestling starts!)

404
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:54,949
- Hold them together. - There you go.

405
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:57,479
(They're using up all their energy.)

406
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:59,109
- This is it. - Keep your thighs together.

407
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:01,409
- It's almost over. - You can do it.

408
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:04,409
(It's a strong offense against a tight defense.)

409
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:09,509
(It's a battle of a spear against a shield. Who will win?)

410
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:11,979
(Their legs tremble.)

411
00:16:11,979 --> 00:16:13,949
(KCM's legs are slowly splitting.)

412
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:16,049
- Keep them together. - It's almost done.

413
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,879
(He tries with all his might.)

414
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:21,779
(Who are these scary people?)

415
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:28,809
(Jong Kook wants to separate KCM's legs while KCM resists.)

416
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:36,849
(As they go through several battles, their battles get more intense.)

417
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:41,279
(KCM's lower body strength is gone along with his upper body strength.)

418
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:42,809
- Good job. - Well done.

419
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:44,249
(His mouth drops open.)

420
00:16:44,609 --> 00:16:46,949
- He won, right? He spread more. - Who won?

421
00:16:46,979 --> 00:16:48,949
- It was a close match. - As a judge,

422
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:52,979
- Jong Kook did separate them more. - He did win, right?

423
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:54,109
Goodness.

424
00:16:54,109 --> 00:16:55,309
Give a round of applause for them.

425
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:57,309
(What will be their next battle?)

426
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:59,579
- Goodness, he's strong. - That was crazy.

427
00:17:00,349 --> 00:17:03,279
- It's the last battle. - I see.

428
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,579
This battle will decide who wins overall, right?

429
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,249
- If you wind it up, it will hurt. - Yes, it will.

430
00:17:06,249 --> 00:17:08,709
This is the game that made Jae Seok stand up.

431
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:15,449
(This miraculous, leg-wrestling game made Jae Seok stand up.)

432
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:19,279
(Jong Kook's opponent for today is the powerful KCM.)

433
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,009
- It will be hard. - Get ready.

434
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,309
This is the last battle.

435
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:25,179
I've never seen Jong Kook this nervous.

436
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:27,179
- It's been ages. - He's not an easy opponent.

437
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,809
You weren't this nervous before.

438
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:30,709
Ready.

439
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:32,209
You can do it.

440
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:34,679
(Leg wrestling starts!)

441
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,779
(From the start, he clenches his teeth.)

442
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:37,979
Goodness.

443
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:42,879
(KCM manages to withstand Jong Kook's power.)

444
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:45,509
- You should hold the rope again. - Yes, I should.

445
00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:47,779
(They pause the game for a moment.)

446
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:49,209
Goodness, they tested each other's power.

447
00:17:49,449 --> 00:17:50,649
Give them a round of applause.

448
00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:52,279
This is amazing.

449
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:53,879
How can this be?

450
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:55,609
(We are very serious.)

451
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,419
It's as if I'm watching a bullfight in Cheongdo.

452
00:17:58,349 --> 00:18:00,979
(He feels the atmosphere of Cheongdo in Jangchung Gymnasium.)

453
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,279
You shouldn't spread your legs like that.

454
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:05,279
How can you compare them to bulls? They are not animals.

455
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:08,549
Their power struggle reminded me of the fight.

456
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:10,419
They are really strong.

457
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:12,979
(They resume the match.)

458
00:18:13,749 --> 00:18:16,949
(Their pride as athletes is at stake on this last battle.)

459
00:18:16,949 --> 00:18:18,979
I think the rope might snap.

460
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:20,079
They are in the air.

461
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:27,209
(To which team will the victory of the first round go?)

462
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,979
(The rope is dangerously tight.)

463
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:34,949
(Slipping)

464
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:37,949
(This is intense.)

465
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:39,579
This won't settle.

466
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:40,879
- This won't work. - They'll hurt themselves.

467
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:42,579
This won't work. Let's do something else.

468
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,179
(It's a tie since they're at similar levels.)

469
00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:48,049
(The result is 1 win, 1 loss, and 1 tie.)

470
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:51,049
(Team Running Man: 1, Team Friends: 1)

471
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:53,479
(Next game is "5-Second Quiz".)

472
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:59,079
All right. It's Haha and Kyung Hwan's turns.

473
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:01,419
"5-Second Quiz".

474
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:03,349
("5-Second Quiz")

475
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:06,279
If you're unable to answer my question in five seconds,

476
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,309
I'll cut one of the wires.

477
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:12,209
There are colors designated to you.

478
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:13,579
If that wire is cut,

479
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:15,609
the balloon filled with flour will pop above your head.

480
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:17,179
Please inflate the balloons.

481
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:18,309
(The balloons are inflated.)

482
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,309
I'm scared of balloons.

483
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:22,449
(It sounds scary.)

484
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:27,179
(Can't we just do something physical?)

485
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:29,349
Can you stop it?

486
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:31,309
(The others are scared as well.)

487
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:33,449
(They get farther away from the balloons.)

488
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:35,309
(All of Jae Seok's friends are cowards.)

489
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:37,879
That's fine. You're good there.

490
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,149
Don't worry.

491
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,779
Please stop.

492
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,679
- It's about to pop. - Please stop.

493
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:45,149
- Is that sound effect? - No, it's not.

494
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:46,919
Are you ready?

495
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:49,309
- Let's start with Haha. - Okay.

496
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:50,949
- Go ahead. - You're dead.

497
00:19:50,949 --> 00:19:52,979
You must answer in five seconds.

498
00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:55,079
Running Man is 7012.

499
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,079
Let's go!

500
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,979
- All right. - What was that?

501
00:19:57,979 --> 00:19:59,609
(We are embarrassed for you.)

502
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:01,579
- Let's get started. - I don't feel good about this.

503
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:03,209
What was your first impression of me?

504
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:08,479
(I have to answer this question in 5 seconds?)

505
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:10,449
- You were handsome, ugly, and nice. - In 4, 3...

506
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:13,349
and 2. All right. What was your first impression of me?

507
00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:15,379
In 5, 4,

508
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:17,479
You had wrinkles. You were losing weight.

509
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:19,479
You had tidy hair.

510
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:21,879
- I said all of them. - He did.

511
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:24,609
- I didn't say how many. - The wrinkles around your eyes.

512
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:25,609
(Kyung Hwan is safe.)

513
00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:27,079
I didn't say how many.

514
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,979
- Why are you take his side? - I'm not taking his side.

515
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,919
- It's obvious you are. - I'm not.

516
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:33,579
Do you choose us or them?

517
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:35,579
- Let me say this again. - Have you forgotten 7012?

518
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:37,149
- I didn't say how many. - You said we were one.

519
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:38,379
Let's continue. Here's the next question.

520
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:39,979
(He gets anxious.)

521
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:41,879
- You're taking his side. - What is it?

522
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:43,179
Does he get you chicken breast?

523
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:44,609
(Kyung Hwan has a chicken breast brand.)

524
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:46,149
(Jae Seok is under fire for getting chicken breast from Kyung Hwan.)

525
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:47,779
- I don't. - I was wondering which one you ate.

526
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,579
- You're mistaken. - I see how it is.

527
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:51,979
(You can't be biased.)

528
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:55,509
Name five positive qualities about me.

529
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:57,579
- In 5, 4, - You talk fast,

530
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:59,449
- you're handsome, and tall. - 3, 2,

531
00:20:59,449 --> 00:21:01,709
- On top of that... - Time's up!

532
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:03,309
My goodness.

533
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:05,379
Why did you change your position?

534
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:07,609
- You should have just said it. - It's Haha's turn.

535
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:11,379
Let's go. Name five positive qualities about me.

536
00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:13,709
- You're ugly, more ugly, very ugly, - In 5, 4, 3,

537
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:15,249
- really ugly, and extremely ugly. - 2...

538
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:17,579
(Haha thinks Jae Seok is just ugly.)

539
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:20,779
(He bombards Jae Seok with bitter facts.)

540
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:23,279
(Haha is safe.)

541
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:24,579
That's good.

542
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:26,349
(He knows Jae Seok well.)

543
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:28,249
Please choose a color.

544
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:31,349
Jae Seok is a grasshopper so I choose green.

545
00:21:31,349 --> 00:21:32,379
All right!

546
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:33,579
(Haha chooses the green wire.)

547
00:21:33,979 --> 00:21:35,179
Green, it is.

548
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:36,419
(Will Kyung Hwan be showered in flour?)

549
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:37,949
You're not changing your mind, right?

550
00:21:37,949 --> 00:21:39,209
No.

551
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:41,479
(There's a 20-percent probability. Will this be the end?)

552
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:43,249
Will Kyung Hwan be eliminated on the first try?

553
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:45,009
1, 2...

554
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:50,679
(They're tied right now. Which team will take the win?)

555
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:53,779
(Cutting)

556
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:54,849
I think that's it.

557
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:55,949
(Kyung Hwan survives.)

558
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,879
(He could have won.)

559
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:00,979
- He survived. - This is so nerve-racking.

560
00:22:00,979 --> 00:22:01,979
(The game continues until the balloon pops.)

561
00:22:01,979 --> 00:22:03,309
That was close.

562
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:06,809
Haha, what are three things you don't want to hear from me?

563
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:09,309
"You're boring, you're ugly, get lost."

564
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:10,679
(Haha replies.)

565
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,049
(Did I say that?)

566
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:14,249
"Get lost" was good.

567
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,449
(Haha passes.)

568
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:17,879
Haha has the upper hand in this game.

569
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,079
- Exactly. - He doesn't usually think.

570
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,079
Kyung Hwan can do this as well. Don't worry.

571
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,879
Kyung Hwan, don't think too much.

572
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:28,079
What are three things you hear a lot from me?

573
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,579
- 5, 4, - He doesn't see him a lot.

574
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:34,479
"Kyung Hwan, Heo Kyung Hwan, you punk, where are you?"

575
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:36,579
(Kyung Hwan passes.)

576
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:38,579
"What are you doing?"

577
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:40,149
(He can almost hear Jae Seok.)

578
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:41,579
I...

579
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:43,879
- Was that three? - Whenever I meet Kyung Hwan,

580
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:45,709
- I say that. - "Heo Kyung Hwan".

581
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:48,209
- You punk. - "You punk".

582
00:22:48,349 --> 00:22:49,609
Those are the things...

583
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:51,579
- I say to him all the time. - Why do you keep...

584
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:52,779
taking his side?

585
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:54,609
- You must be on their team. - What's wrong with you?

586
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:57,449
It's true. I say that all the time.

587
00:22:57,449 --> 00:22:59,709
It's like I bumped into you in the hallway.

588
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:01,409
- Next. - This is difficult.

589
00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:05,049
Five things you think you're better than me in.

590
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:06,949
I'm handsome, my family is better off, and my wife is prettier.

591
00:23:06,949 --> 00:23:07,949
Four...

592
00:23:07,949 --> 00:23:10,209
(He's more handsome and better off. He has a more beautiful wife, too.)

593
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:13,379
(He has no logic behind his answers.)

594
00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:16,679
- Hold on. - That was incredible.

595
00:23:17,409 --> 00:23:19,949
I don't know about the last one.

596
00:23:19,949 --> 00:23:20,949
(I'm sorry, my honey.)

597
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,679
(My wife is the best.)

598
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:26,049
He's saying whatever.

599
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:27,679
(Everybody starts talking.)

600
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:30,779
- Okay, I'll give you that. - All right.

601
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:34,179
I'm not approving his answer but we'll just move on.

602
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,379
- Byul is pretty. - Let's just do three.

603
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,709
- Do you know what he just said? - What did he say?

604
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,849
"Byul is pretty."

605
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:43,049
(Jae Seok receives an unexpected, second blow.)

606
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:44,879
- She's pretty. - He thinks she's pretty.

607
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:46,049
(My friends are too involved in the game.)

608
00:23:46,849 --> 00:23:48,279
- She's pretty. - He thinks she's pretty.

609
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:49,279
(Haha is just happy.)

610
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:51,979
- Byul is pretty. - Next.

611
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:53,579
Kyung Hwan.

612
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,349
Three things you think you're better than me in.

613
00:23:57,349 --> 00:23:59,179
I'm shorter but more handsome, I'm shorter but more awesome,

614
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:01,979
I'm shorter but faster, and I'm shorter but stronger.

615
00:24:01,979 --> 00:24:03,149
(He's shorter but better in many ways.)

616
00:24:03,249 --> 00:24:05,349
You asked for 3 things but he said 4.

617
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:08,079
- You can choose them. - Only answer three from now on.

618
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,349
Good job, Kyung Hwan.

619
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:12,249
Three times you didn't want to see me.

620
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:13,679
- Now, yesterday, and 2 days ago. - 5...

621
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:15,409
Correct!

622
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:16,879
(These are facts, too.)

623
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:17,879
Correct.

624
00:24:17,879 --> 00:24:20,079
- Correct. - That was the best.

625
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,079
(Haha passes easily.)

626
00:24:21,849 --> 00:24:24,449
He knows Jae Seok too well.

627
00:24:24,449 --> 00:24:26,709
He has experience. He's good at this.

628
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:28,309
It's your turn, Kyung Hwan.

629
00:24:28,949 --> 00:24:31,709
Five things you want to change about me.

630
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:33,579
- 5, 4... - Talking about work during dinner,

631
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:36,679
talking about work after work is over,

632
00:24:37,149 --> 00:24:38,979
(I win.)

633
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:40,579
This won't work.

634
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,609
- Fail. - Why is that a fail?

635
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:44,679
How do I beat Haha?

636
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,979
Should I choose red?

637
00:24:46,979 --> 00:24:48,049
Sure.

638
00:24:48,349 --> 00:24:51,179
Running man is passion! The color of passion is red!

639
00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:53,949
- 7012! - Red?

640
00:24:53,949 --> 00:24:55,309
(They're so cheesy.)

641
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,379
(Kyung Hwan is in danger again.)

642
00:24:58,379 --> 00:25:00,779
Is red correct?

643
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:08,049
(Would Team Friends lose or get another chance?)

644
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,049
(Cutting)

645
00:25:09,879 --> 00:25:10,949
He cut it.

646
00:25:10,949 --> 00:25:15,249
(The team that wins round 1 will get a prize and a hint.)

647
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,849
(Popping)

648
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:21,579
(Haha wins.)

649
00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:23,679
Haha wins.

650
00:25:24,749 --> 00:25:26,649
Do your move and shake it off.

651
00:25:27,379 --> 00:25:30,049
(There's flour everywhere.)

652
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:32,979
(He's mad at Haha.)

653
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:35,949
(Team Running Man: 2, Team Friends: 1)

654
00:25:35,949 --> 00:25:39,479
(Ji Hyo and Won Hee are up next.)

655
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:41,479
(Entering)

656
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:45,679
(She looks very spiritual.)

657
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:47,679
It suits you well.

658
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,309
Did you get involved in a new religion?

659
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:51,949
(She's here to experience the flour baptism.)

660
00:25:51,949 --> 00:25:54,179
- Sister. - She looks like a nun.

661
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:57,349
It looks nice on both of you.

662
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,209
(The gymnasium is turned into a sacred place.)

663
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:01,279
- She looks exotic. - Somebody from Dubai.

664
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,409
She looks like a rich lady from Dubai.

665
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:05,579
Won Hee used to be so pretty.

666
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:07,949
All right. Ji Hyo is ready.

667
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:10,309
- You saw the previous game, right? - Yes.

668
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:12,949
We'll get started right away then.

669
00:26:12,949 --> 00:26:17,249
Name five negative qualities about me.

670
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,579
- 5, 4, - You talk a lot, you glare at me,

671
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,609
- He wears glasses. - you wear glasses,

672
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:23,879
your lips protrude, and your eyes are small.

673
00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:25,309
Okay.

674
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:27,149
Don't be so honest.

675
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:28,379
(It sounded like the truth.)

676
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,449
Do I glare at you?

677
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:32,179
She was looking at you straight in the eye.

678
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:35,679
All right. Name five negative qualities about me.

679
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,449
- Negative qualities? - Name five. Start.

680
00:26:38,449 --> 00:26:40,409
You only wear tight pants, your nose is round,

681
00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:42,579
- 3, 2, - you change your glasses too often,

682
00:26:42,579 --> 00:26:44,149
your lips protrude, and your teeth are ugly.

683
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:45,979
(These are her truthful answers.)

684
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:49,449
You got two from his mouth. Good job.

685
00:26:49,449 --> 00:26:50,849
(Jae Seok's worst qualities come from his mouth.)

686
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:52,179
You were close.

687
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:53,609
(Won Hee passes.)

688
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:55,579
The other team complained.

689
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,879
Let's move on.

690
00:26:56,879 --> 00:26:59,849
Three things I say a lot.

691
00:26:59,849 --> 00:27:02,209
- 5, 4, 3, - "Be quiet, get lost,"

692
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:03,679
- 2, - "you're too loud, go away,"

693
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,279
"go."

694
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:07,879
(Ji Hyo passes.)

695
00:27:07,949 --> 00:27:09,779
She said, "Go."

696
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:12,809
Three times when you think...

697
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:16,249
I look pitiful. Go. Five,

698
00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:17,579
- When you get wedgies, - four,

699
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:19,279
(When he gets wedgies.)

700
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:22,209
when you argue with your wife...

701
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:25,949
- and ask me to talk. - Time's up.

702
00:27:25,949 --> 00:27:27,279
Time's up. You fail.

703
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,349
You're trying to be honest. Just make it up.

704
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:32,409
- Ji Hyo. - You have to make it up.

705
00:27:32,409 --> 00:27:33,409
All right.

706
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:35,579
(Ji Hyo gets to choose a color.)

707
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:37,309
- Blue. - Blue, it is.

708
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,179
- I think she's right. - I think she is.

709
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:40,349
Hold on.

710
00:27:40,349 --> 00:27:44,179
(Will Won Hee get another chance?)

711
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:48,479
(Or will Ji Hyo continue Running Man's winning streak?)

712
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:49,479
(Cutting)

713
00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:51,349
(The wire has been cut.)

714
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:52,979
- Hold on. - The balloon is blue.

715
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:55,949
(Popping)

716
00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:00,679
(Ji Hyo wins in one try.)

717
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,849
Ji Hyo wins.

718
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,049
(Team Running Man: 3, Team Friends: 1)

719
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:09,179
(Seok Jin and Yong Man are next.)

720
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:12,809
Seok Jin and Yong Man...

721
00:28:12,979 --> 00:28:15,579
will face each other in a one-legged fight.

722
00:28:15,579 --> 00:28:17,349
You haven't played this against each other, right?

723
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:19,009
- We haven't. - We've never played it.

724
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:20,209
I haven't seen it, either.

725
00:28:20,209 --> 00:28:21,949
We don't play physical games.

726
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:23,709
We hardly exercised together.

727
00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:26,809
Exactly. I go to the gym...

728
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:29,079
that Yong Man recommended.

729
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:31,449
I didn't know he'd get so addicted to it.

730
00:28:31,449 --> 00:28:34,479
I go frequently but Yong Man stopped after three times.

731
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:37,909
I looked around the gym and it wasn't my style.

732
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:41,209
I felt like smelling the place...

733
00:28:41,209 --> 00:28:43,349
gave me enough energy...

734
00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:45,909
so I just smelled around and headed for the sauna.

735
00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:47,409
That's where I go.

736
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:50,149
Are you ready?

737
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:51,849
- Yes. - It's Seok Jin and Yong Man.

738
00:28:51,849 --> 00:28:53,709
- Okay. - All right.

739
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:56,209
- We've never done this before. - Let's go!

740
00:28:56,209 --> 00:28:58,949
I wonder how this will turn out.

741
00:28:58,949 --> 00:29:01,149
These two never had...

742
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:03,349
- physical contact with each other. - Never.

743
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:05,879
They only talked.

744
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:07,179
This is their first time.

745
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:09,709
I wanted to face him physically today.

746
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:12,209
- I've known him for 30 years. - Get ready.

747
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,349
Let's get started with the one-legged fight.

748
00:29:14,349 --> 00:29:16,709
- You can do it. - Ready.

749
00:29:17,009 --> 00:29:19,309
Seok Jin played a lot of games.

750
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:21,249
- Seok Jin! - All right.

751
00:29:22,209 --> 00:29:24,949
You have a weird form.

752
00:29:24,949 --> 00:29:27,109
(They look for a chance to attack.)

753
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:30,149
(Bumping)

754
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:32,949
(Yong Man attacks first.)

755
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:35,509
(Striking)

756
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,149
Are you all right?

757
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:39,049
- Isn't this what we do? - That's right.

758
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:41,779
(He continues to attack.)

759
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:44,079
- Yong Man is good at this. - He is.

760
00:29:44,109 --> 00:29:46,949
- Be careful. - He's really good at this.

761
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:49,409
(This is an unexpected side of him.)

762
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,209
He's really good at this.

763
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:53,549
- Seok Jin. - Be careful.

764
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:55,309
Yong Man is unexpectedly...

765
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:56,879
- You're tired already. - For 30 years...

766
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:57,879
(Attacking)

767
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,609
- Why are they so slow? - You're breathing heavily.

768
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:01,579
(Yong Man's breathing heavily.)

769
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,779
Should we take a break?

770
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:05,679
That sounds like a good idea.

771
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,209
- Put our legs down in three. - Sure.

772
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:08,809
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

773
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:11,879
- No, I won't put it down. - Me, neither.

774
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:14,009
- Let's just take a break. - Shall we?

775
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:15,579
This is your chance.

776
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:17,879
What was that?

777
00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:21,409
(Groaning)

778
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:24,709
(Collapsing)

779
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:26,249
What was that?

780
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:28,379
Why did you collapse?

781
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:30,409
What did you do?

782
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,509
I tried to attack.

783
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:35,309
- Come back. - That was embarrassing.

784
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,349
That was a humiliating loss.

785
00:30:37,949 --> 00:30:40,579
- I feel bad. - You bowed in their direction.

786
00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:43,309
I didn't know you'd collapse so easily.

787
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,049
Nobody gets thrown to the ground in a one-legged fight.

788
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:47,709
(Yong Man, I didn't know you were this strong.)

789
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,779
(Team Running Man: 3, Team Friends: 2)

790
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:53,579
(Kwang Soo and Chun Hee will play "Pole Wrestling".)

791
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:55,209
"Pole Wrestling"...

792
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:58,209
will be played by Kwang Soo and Chun Hee.

793
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:01,449
This is Kwang Soo's game.

794
00:31:01,449 --> 00:31:03,779
Kwang Soo is strong, too.

795
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:05,509
I haven't heard that before.

796
00:31:05,749 --> 00:31:07,349
Me, neither.

797
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:10,249
- That was discouraging. - Is he strong?

798
00:31:10,249 --> 00:31:13,379
- Yes. - Chun Hee surfed for a long time.

799
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:15,649
He has real muscles.

800
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:18,209
He's a surfer.

801
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,549
You can do it.

802
00:31:19,749 --> 00:31:21,179
- Ready. - Let's go.

803
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,849
Get set, go.

804
00:31:24,409 --> 00:31:25,409
All right.

805
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:26,679
(They both climb at once.)

806
00:31:27,449 --> 00:31:31,679
(The two giraffes reach the top.)

807
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,579
(They don't hesitate.)

808
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:37,579
Push him down. Attack.

809
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:40,409
- Good job. - He's winning.

810
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:43,309
- Tickle him. - He's winning.

811
00:31:43,579 --> 00:31:45,349
- Kwang Soo. - What's wrong, Chun Hee?

812
00:31:45,879 --> 00:31:47,809
What's with that face?

813
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:50,579
Don't make that face.

814
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:51,979
You're supposed to use your feet.

815
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:54,779
- Use your feet, Chun Hee. - Don't make that face.

816
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,409
Do something. Come on.

817
00:31:58,209 --> 00:32:00,079
Ouch! Hold on!

818
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:01,649
(He feels pain.)

819
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:04,979
Hold on. I said, hold on.

820
00:32:05,379 --> 00:32:07,649
(He doesn't know what to do.)

821
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:11,079
(This is your chance, Chun Hee.)

822
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:13,509
Spin him around.

823
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:14,549
(Spinning)

824
00:32:15,209 --> 00:32:18,649
(Is Kwang Soo out?)

825
00:32:18,649 --> 00:32:20,279
Good job.

826
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,949
(Did you think I was going to let go?)

827
00:32:21,949 --> 00:32:24,879
- Good job. - You have the advantage.

828
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:26,279
- Let's go, Chun Hee. - Spin him around.

829
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:29,379
- All right. - Good job.

830
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:31,909
Kwang Soo and Chun Hee.

831
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:32,909
(If Chun Hee loses, his team loses.)

832
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,649
- You have to attack now. - This is looking good.

833
00:32:34,649 --> 00:32:36,679
- You have to attack now. - Attack.

834
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:38,479
- Come closer. - I can't.

835
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:39,979
I can't come closer.

836
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:43,309
- Don't get closer. - He's coming.

837
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:45,479
- We have to win, Chun Hee. - You can do it!

838
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:48,509
- Let's go. - We can't lose.

839
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:50,579
(Grabbing)

840
00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:52,749
All right. Good job.

841
00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:54,679
- Chun Hee. - You're fierce.

842
00:32:54,979 --> 00:32:57,079
You're fierce. Don't let go.

843
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:58,179
He's winning.

844
00:32:58,449 --> 00:33:00,749
Good job. Keep going.

845
00:33:00,749 --> 00:33:03,779
(Kwang Soo hangs on with his hands.)

846
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:07,609
(Chun Hee looks for a chance to make a tie.)

847
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:10,609
(Who will touch the ground first?)

848
00:33:10,609 --> 00:33:13,409
(Good bye, Kwang Soo.)

849
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:18,709
(Chun Hee is the better giraffe.)

850
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:21,879
Chun Hee wins!

851
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:25,809
(Team Running Man: 3, Team Friends: 3)

852
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:27,949
Round one was a tie.

853
00:33:28,349 --> 00:33:29,909
- What about the vitamins? - It was a tie.

854
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:32,209
It'll be added on to the prize for the next round.

855
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:34,179
(Prizes and hint for round 1 will be added to the next round.)

856
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:38,209
- That sounds good. - Prizes for the next round doubles.

857
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:39,249
It will double.

858
00:33:39,249 --> 00:33:41,679
- It doubles. - Let's get started with round two.

859
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:42,809
(We'll win the next round.)

860
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:45,209
Thanks to you, we tied.

861
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:54,549
Round two involves eating.

862
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:55,679
(Lunch is a bonus.)

863
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,809
- I didn't have breakfast. - You didn't?

864
00:33:57,809 --> 00:34:00,649
I love sausage stew.

865
00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:02,449
(They have everything from sausage stew to bulgogi.)

866
00:34:02,449 --> 00:34:04,579
It's braised spicy chicken.

867
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:06,349
That looks so good.

868
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:08,709
- There's octopus as well. - Where?

869
00:34:08,709 --> 00:34:11,009
- There it is. - This is hot pot bulgogi.

870
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:12,249
(What game will they play?)

871
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:14,149
We can't just let you eat.

872
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:17,579
We'll do a chatting battle. It's time to talk.

873
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:19,179
We have Seok Jin.

874
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:21,349
He's the chatty king.

875
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:24,649
There's chicken as well. I want Seok Jin to have some.

876
00:34:26,209 --> 00:34:27,549
Why?

877
00:34:27,549 --> 00:34:29,409
- Just because. - Excuse me.

878
00:34:30,049 --> 00:34:32,449
Let's arm wrestle.

879
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:33,549
Look at that.

880
00:34:33,549 --> 00:34:37,749
Anyway, we have the vitamins from round one...

881
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:40,319
- and the prize from round two. - What is it?

882
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:42,009
It's accumulated.

883
00:34:42,009 --> 00:34:44,509
Prize for round two is a set of Korean beef.

884
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:45,679
It's Korean beef.

885
00:34:46,509 --> 00:34:47,509
(Prize for round two is a set of Korean beef.)

886
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:50,249
It's for the winner to take.

887
00:34:50,249 --> 00:34:56,249
(On top of that, the winning team gets 2 hints on the treasure.)

888
00:34:56,249 --> 00:34:59,079
(However, Jae Seok doesn't know that.)

889
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:02,749
You don't have to talk about me.

890
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:04,649
Let's talk comfortably.

891
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:08,409
I'll reward you with a dish on the spot.

892
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:10,909
You probably have many stories to share.

893
00:35:11,779 --> 00:35:14,249
We have a friend named Yoon Gi Won.

894
00:35:14,249 --> 00:35:16,509
He bought his first car.

895
00:35:16,509 --> 00:35:18,079
We're all fellow comedians.

896
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:20,949
It wasn't a good car.

897
00:35:20,949 --> 00:35:23,279
- It was an old car. - He bought an old car.

898
00:35:23,779 --> 00:35:26,879
We were all staring at it.

899
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:30,209
We were supposed to meet in Apgujeong-dong.

900
00:35:30,209 --> 00:35:33,209
When it got dark, his car lightened up when he drove.

901
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:35,249
When he stopped, the light turned off.

902
00:35:35,449 --> 00:35:37,979
- Isn't that a good car? - I was wondering what it was.

903
00:35:37,979 --> 00:35:40,409
This was 20 years ago.

904
00:35:40,649 --> 00:35:42,949
It was like neon lights.

905
00:35:42,949 --> 00:35:46,209
The light turned on and went away when he stopped.

906
00:35:46,649 --> 00:35:49,609
I thought it was incredible. I went to have a look.

907
00:35:49,749 --> 00:35:51,709
He rolled down his window.

908
00:35:51,709 --> 00:35:55,549
(What was the secret behind the technology?)

909
00:35:56,449 --> 00:35:58,819
The seat belt was broken...

910
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:01,549
so the metal buckle was screeching the ground.

911
00:36:01,779 --> 00:36:03,409
(The spark was from the metal buckle.)

912
00:36:03,409 --> 00:36:06,079
- This is a true story. - It was gone.

913
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,479
- There was a spark? - This is a true story.

914
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:09,449
It was gone.

915
00:36:09,449 --> 00:36:11,279
(Gi Won decided not to have a seat belt.)

916
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:14,009
When he drove, the spark came on...

917
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:15,979
- and when he stopped, it went away. - It's true.

918
00:36:15,979 --> 00:36:17,609
- The light would come on? - That's right.

919
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:20,279
When he drove faster, the light was more intense.

920
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,349
It's true. Good job, Yong Man.

921
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:25,379
Here's hot pot bulgogi.

922
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:28,979
- That is your reward. - That was great teamwork.

923
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:32,849
I'll talk about my car and manager in the same story.

924
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:36,009
It's not about my current manager. My previous manager...

925
00:36:36,379 --> 00:36:38,609
would always be sleeping when I returned from work.

926
00:36:38,849 --> 00:36:41,109
So I gave him an advice. I told him not to sleep...

927
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:43,579
and read a book to make better use of his time.

928
00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:46,379
I told him a few times so he said he won't fall asleep again.

929
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:49,819
One day after "Gag Concert", I opened the car door...

930
00:36:50,049 --> 00:36:51,279
and he sprang up from his seat.

931
00:36:51,649 --> 00:36:54,149
I asked if he was sleeping and he said no.

932
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:57,879
I told him to drive. He used a water bottle as the gear stick.

933
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:01,819
His water bottle was always on the side. He grabbed it.

934
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:04,679
- He didn't even look. - Good one.

935
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:06,319
(Here's braised short ribs for you.)

936
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:08,779
Let's do something.

937
00:37:08,779 --> 00:37:10,379
That was good.

938
00:37:10,549 --> 00:37:11,709
So...

939
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:14,379
(If they win another point, Team Friends will win this round.)

940
00:37:14,379 --> 00:37:15,649
It's a true story.

941
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:19,049
Lee Hoon's manager...

942
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:22,009
His manager gets nervous easily.

943
00:37:22,009 --> 00:37:23,749
He's been on television quite a few times.

944
00:37:23,749 --> 00:37:25,749
He's a funny guy.

945
00:37:25,749 --> 00:37:28,449
He was nervous about his job.

946
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:31,009
One time, Hoon had a few drinks.

947
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:34,449
He's a manly guy so he sat next to the driver's seat.

948
00:37:34,509 --> 00:37:38,149
He said, "Let's go." The manager was backing up and grabbed his head.

949
00:37:38,649 --> 00:37:39,649
(He grabbed Hoon's head.)

950
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:42,449
(My gosh)

951
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:44,649
He was nervous.

952
00:37:44,649 --> 00:37:45,779
That was good teamwork.

953
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:47,449
Good job, Seok Jin.

954
00:37:47,449 --> 00:37:49,949
That was good teamwork with Seok Jin.

955
00:37:49,949 --> 00:37:52,209
- He was backing up. - That was good teamwork.

956
00:37:52,209 --> 00:37:55,079
- He was too nervous. - That was funny.

957
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:57,849
- I just remembered something. - Here he goes.

958
00:37:58,149 --> 00:37:59,949
- Here he goes. - This is true.

959
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:02,009
Don't say that.

960
00:38:02,109 --> 00:38:04,479
- You're a bad person. - You're the chatty king.

961
00:38:04,479 --> 00:38:06,819
- I'm not the chatty king. - But you are.

962
00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:07,849
Fine.

963
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:10,449
- Don't make fun of me. - What? It's true.

964
00:38:10,449 --> 00:38:12,509
Let's keep it natural. Why would you say that?

965
00:38:12,509 --> 00:38:15,149
- He can beat Yong Man. - I'm not trying to beat him.

966
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:18,179
Why would I try to beat him? I'm happy my friend is here.

967
00:38:19,149 --> 00:38:22,109
- It's a story about a thug boss. - I like this.

968
00:38:22,179 --> 00:38:24,879
He had this tattoo across his chest.

969
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:27,449
During a fierce fight,

970
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:30,379
he was stabbed in the stomach.

971
00:38:31,149 --> 00:38:32,979
(They start to get bored.)

972
00:38:33,149 --> 00:38:34,609
He was transferred to the operation room.

973
00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:35,749
(Isn't it working?)

974
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:38,179
- To the operation room. - Wait.

975
00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:39,879
- Hear me out. - They look uncertain.

976
00:38:39,909 --> 00:38:41,379
- That's why he can't talk. - Hear me out.

977
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:43,149
Yong Man.

978
00:38:43,149 --> 00:38:45,979
- Show some response. - They're just sneering.

979
00:38:45,979 --> 00:38:47,249
Show some response.

980
00:38:47,249 --> 00:38:49,549
I can't look him in the eye.

981
00:38:49,549 --> 00:38:51,909
- He's acting like the leader. - Wait.

982
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:54,549
No one here is saying anything.

983
00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:57,079
- Right? - We're just relaxed.

984
00:38:57,109 --> 00:38:58,449
- Hear me out. - Calm down.

985
00:38:59,109 --> 00:39:00,279
Sit down.

986
00:39:01,249 --> 00:39:02,549
He's sent to the operating room.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

987
00:39:02,779 --> 00:39:04,409
He's admitted to the operating room.

988
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:05,609
I'm telling a short version.

989
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:07,179
The doctor asks him,

990
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:09,179
"Do you have a wish?"

991
00:39:09,249 --> 00:39:10,409
Is he skipping everything in between?

992
00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:13,579
He's about to have surgery.

993
00:39:14,049 --> 00:39:15,049
"Please..."

994
00:39:15,049 --> 00:39:16,949
(They're all hoping Seok Jin will make them laugh.)

995
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:20,949
(What favor did the boss ask the doctor before the surgery?)

996
00:39:21,449 --> 00:39:23,179
"Please connect the tattoos correctly."

997
00:39:23,179 --> 00:39:25,819
(The boss asked the doctor to connect the tattoos properly.)

998
00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:27,149
Give up now!

999
00:39:27,149 --> 00:39:28,449
(Haha explodes.)

1000
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,249
- Give up! - Wasn't it funny?

1001
00:39:30,249 --> 00:39:31,479
(Aren't you holding back your laughter?)

1002
00:39:31,479 --> 00:39:33,749
Tell him he doesn't have to do this just because he's the leader.

1003
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:36,609
You don't have to do this.

1004
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:39,209
He's feeling so burdened.

1005
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:42,149
Seok Jin is usually not like this.

1006
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:43,909
It's your fault.

1007
00:39:43,909 --> 00:39:45,379
Sit down.

1008
00:39:45,379 --> 00:39:46,579
It's time to listen to them.

1009
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:47,709
All right.

1010
00:39:47,709 --> 00:39:51,279
We have sausage stew left. You can have it.

1011
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:52,879
We have sausage stew left.

1012
00:39:52,979 --> 00:39:55,609
Jokes need context.

1013
00:39:55,609 --> 00:39:57,609
We have sausage stew left.

1014
00:39:57,609 --> 00:39:59,979
I'll talk about army lives.

1015
00:40:00,249 --> 00:40:01,319
It's about my friend.

1016
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:02,509
(He'll talk about army lives.)

1017
00:40:02,509 --> 00:40:04,909
He got a subordinate...

1018
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,679
who's a martial-arts champion.

1019
00:40:06,749 --> 00:40:09,149
One night, they were on patrol.

1020
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:11,909
He was getting bored, so he talked to his subordinate.

1021
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:13,409
"Hey, come here."

1022
00:40:14,249 --> 00:40:16,079
"Ghosts appear around here from time to time."

1023
00:40:16,609 --> 00:40:19,609
"Some were so shocked that they had to be discharged."

1024
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:22,479
"You should be careful, too." He tried to scare him.

1025
00:40:22,979 --> 00:40:26,149
What he wanted to do was startle the martial-arts champion.

1026
00:40:26,149 --> 00:40:27,819
"So..."

1027
00:40:27,819 --> 00:40:30,079
"Oh, it's there!" The champion was startled...

1028
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,349
and punched his superior.

1029
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:34,779
He had a double nosebleed.

1030
00:40:35,879 --> 00:40:38,319
He had a double nosebleed.

1031
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,349
That's funny.

1032
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:40,949
That was so predictable.

1033
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:43,849
- He pulled it off. - So...

1034
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:46,179
- The punching part was funny. - Punch.

1035
00:40:46,509 --> 00:40:49,149
Anyway...

1036
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:50,609
In the second round,

1037
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:52,649
Team Friends wins.

1038
00:40:52,649 --> 00:40:54,549
(Team Friends wins.)

1039
00:40:54,609 --> 00:40:57,179
As promised, you can take the vitamins...

1040
00:40:57,609 --> 00:40:58,979
and Korean beef.

1041
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,679
Each should get one.

1042
00:41:01,979 --> 00:41:04,109
Don't worry. There are two more rounds left.

1043
00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:05,279
Sure.

1044
00:41:05,279 --> 00:41:06,509
In the silver box...

1045
00:41:10,749 --> 00:41:12,979
(The first hint is a paper ship.)

1046
00:41:13,709 --> 00:41:15,049
This is the hint.

1047
00:41:15,149 --> 00:41:16,549
- Where? - Be careful.

1048
00:41:17,179 --> 00:41:19,449
(You like my gifts, right?)

1049
00:41:19,819 --> 00:41:22,179
(They must have found a hint.)

1050
00:41:23,409 --> 00:41:25,449
Can we take a look?

1051
00:41:26,409 --> 00:41:28,479
- No. - Can we take a look?

1052
00:41:28,479 --> 00:41:30,549
- Just see it from a distance. - Show us.

1053
00:41:30,549 --> 00:41:31,579
Look.

1054
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:33,709
(They find the second hint in the beef, too.)

1055
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:39,379
Wait.

1056
00:41:39,379 --> 00:41:42,979
- There are many gifts left. - Are they good ones?

1057
00:41:42,979 --> 00:41:44,979
- Are they better than the first? - Of course.

1058
00:41:44,979 --> 00:41:47,649
We've already won two gifts.

1059
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:49,079
I feel so confident.

1060
00:41:49,149 --> 00:41:50,819
The vitamins are working.

1061
00:41:50,819 --> 00:41:52,009
- They are. - They woke me up.

1062
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:56,009
The gifts in the third round are even better.

1063
00:41:56,009 --> 00:41:57,579
Better than beef?

1064
00:41:57,579 --> 00:41:59,549
- What would it be? - Do you have the beef with you?

1065
00:41:59,549 --> 00:42:01,149
- Yes. - It's ours.

1066
00:42:01,509 --> 00:42:04,609
Let's discuss how to divide it.

1067
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:06,609
Each can take his or her favorite part.

1068
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:09,109
Let's talk when we get off.

1069
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,879
(Will Team Friends find the treasure before Team Running Man does?)

1070
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,909
We don't have much time.

1071
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:16,379
We have two hints.

1072
00:42:16,509 --> 00:42:19,779
Each vitamin box had a paper boat.

1073
00:42:19,779 --> 00:42:21,379
- That's right. - Do we have to take it out?

1074
00:42:21,379 --> 00:42:22,909
- No. It's just a paper ship. - What was the other one?

1075
00:42:22,909 --> 00:42:24,179
What was in the beef box?

1076
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:25,649
There's no text, right?

1077
00:42:25,749 --> 00:42:27,319
The second hint is very simple, too.

1078
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:29,009
- What is it? - It's this.

1079
00:42:29,009 --> 00:42:30,979
- A grasshopper? - It must mean...

1080
00:42:30,979 --> 00:42:32,879
Jae Seok knows something.

1081
00:42:32,979 --> 00:42:35,479
- This is it. - Is that it?

1082
00:42:35,479 --> 00:42:38,779
- A grasshopper and a ship? - This was in the beef box.

1083
00:42:38,779 --> 00:42:40,649
Is the paper ship a hint?

1084
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:43,479
- There are ships. - There are ships.

1085
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:44,649
There are four ships.

1086
00:42:44,709 --> 00:42:48,679
It has something to do with Jae Seok.

1087
00:42:48,749 --> 00:42:51,979
- I think we're right. - I think it's about his stomach.

1088
00:42:51,979 --> 00:42:53,509
Something must be in his stomach.

1089
00:42:54,479 --> 00:42:55,579
Hair?

1090
00:42:55,879 --> 00:42:57,079
Hair?

1091
00:42:57,179 --> 00:42:58,579
The treasure's in his hair?

1092
00:42:58,879 --> 00:42:59,979
What is this?

1093
00:42:59,979 --> 00:43:01,509
(They need to find the treasure.)

1094
00:43:01,509 --> 00:43:04,549
It's time for the third round.

1095
00:43:04,819 --> 00:43:09,049
It's simple. It's a match between the teams.

1096
00:43:09,049 --> 00:43:13,349
If your song gets more than 90 points, you'll get 5 minutes.

1097
00:43:13,749 --> 00:43:15,749
If your song gets between 80 and 90 points, you'll get 3 minutes.

1098
00:43:15,749 --> 00:43:16,949
We get 5 or 3 minutes?

1099
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:20,179
I'll tell you what to do during the given time.

1100
00:43:20,279 --> 00:43:23,949
Behind you are 30 vans.

1101
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:26,079
While the tagging team is...

1102
00:43:26,279 --> 00:43:29,049
staying here,

1103
00:43:29,049 --> 00:43:31,509
the other team will hide themselves in the vans.

1104
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:33,549
(It's a hide-and-seek inside the vans.)

1105
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:37,449
(Find the best spots to hide yourselves in the vans.)

1106
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:38,649
("Hide-and-Seek")

1107
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:39,979
There are so many vans.

1108
00:43:40,009 --> 00:43:43,179
(They'll hide in the vans while the tagging team sings.)

1109
00:43:43,209 --> 00:43:46,509
(The tagging team will be given either 3 or 5 minutes to find them.)

1110
00:43:46,549 --> 00:43:48,379
We'll sing first.

1111
00:43:48,379 --> 00:43:49,549
- Do you want to sing first? - Yes.

1112
00:43:49,549 --> 00:43:51,179
All right. While we're singing,

1113
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:53,479
- Team Friends will hide themselves. - We'll hide.

1114
00:43:53,479 --> 00:43:55,079
Start as soon as the song begins.

1115
00:43:55,249 --> 00:43:56,809
Pick a long song.

1116
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,079
Ready.

1117
00:43:58,609 --> 00:44:00,179
Start.

1118
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,249
("Unconditionally")

1119
00:44:01,379 --> 00:44:02,549
Here we go.

1120
00:44:02,549 --> 00:44:05,809
(They're getting ready to sing.)

1121
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,349
Who wants to sing?

1122
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:09,279
What should we do?

1123
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:10,909
- Okay. - Let's go.

1124
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:12,349
Let me see.

1125
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:13,409
Where should we hide?

1126
00:44:13,709 --> 00:44:15,879
Psychologically...

1127
00:44:15,879 --> 00:44:17,509
- In the middle? - The middle?

1128
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:19,909
How can we not get caught?

1129
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:22,709
Let's find vans with dark windows.

1130
00:44:23,309 --> 00:44:25,509
(Which vans have dark windows?)

1131
00:44:26,279 --> 00:44:30,179
Should I hide in the trunk? They might open it.

1132
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:31,179
The trunk?

1133
00:44:31,509 --> 00:44:32,679
Should I hide here?

1134
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:35,979
(Won Hee and KCM will hide in the trunk.)

1135
00:44:35,979 --> 00:44:38,079
I wish I had a smaller body.

1136
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,509
Please cover me up.

1137
00:44:39,509 --> 00:44:42,109
If they find you, drive them away.

1138
00:44:42,709 --> 00:44:44,709
Cover me up.

1139
00:44:44,709 --> 00:44:45,749
(KCM will divert their attention.)

1140
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:48,249
(Won Hee hides under a blanket.)

1141
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,079
Stay there. It's perfect.

1142
00:44:51,149 --> 00:44:52,879
Should I lower my body?

1143
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:55,249
No. It looks perfect.

1144
00:44:55,709 --> 00:44:57,649
Find vans with dark windows.

1145
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,349
Should we hide ourselves behind the drivers?

1146
00:45:01,749 --> 00:45:04,349
Here. Can we hide here?

1147
00:45:04,879 --> 00:45:06,449
You can stay here.

1148
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,379
Just make yourself comfortable.

1149
00:45:08,749 --> 00:45:11,849
I should pretend that I'm a driver.

1150
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:13,179
(Yong Man and Chun Hee pretend to be drivers.)

1151
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:15,049
- Come here. - In the front...

1152
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:17,649
Wait. I'll sit first.

1153
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:19,449
Sit in front of me.

1154
00:45:19,449 --> 00:45:21,409
(Yong Man sits the driver on his lap.)

1155
00:45:21,409 --> 00:45:22,779
Like this.

1156
00:45:22,779 --> 00:45:24,149
(They can even hear each other breathe.)

1157
00:45:25,279 --> 00:45:26,409
(Honking)

1158
00:45:26,409 --> 00:45:29,009
(His stomach pushes the horn.)

1159
00:45:29,009 --> 00:45:30,079
What's this?

1160
00:45:30,279 --> 00:45:31,649
Why are they honking?

1161
00:45:32,249 --> 00:45:34,009
(They won't be able to find us.)

1162
00:45:34,009 --> 00:45:35,149
Stop honking.

1163
00:45:35,249 --> 00:45:37,449
It'll be impossible to find me.

1164
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,649
The song is almost over.

1165
00:45:40,049 --> 00:45:41,179
Be careful.

1166
00:45:41,479 --> 00:45:44,449
Why is the song so long?

1167
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:47,709
(To get the hint, they have to hide in the right spots.)

1168
00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:50,179
Why is it already over?

1169
00:45:51,579 --> 00:45:53,249
This jacket will trick them.

1170
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:58,809
(Kyung Hwan plans to distract them with his jacket.)

1171
00:45:59,449 --> 00:46:02,879
(There's a 10-percent chance that they'll be caught.)

1172
00:46:03,509 --> 00:46:07,179
(Team Running Man's performance is almost over.)

1173
00:46:07,179 --> 00:46:10,479
(They sing the last line.)

1174
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:11,579
What's our score?

1175
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:13,709
(They need a high score to win more time.)

1176
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:15,709
Please.

1177
00:46:15,709 --> 00:46:17,279
Is it 98?

1178
00:46:17,279 --> 00:46:18,609
(A new, singing king is born.)

1179
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,609
100 points.

1180
00:46:20,109 --> 00:46:21,149
(They get 100 points.)

1181
00:46:21,149 --> 00:46:22,609
100 points.

1182
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:23,749
What should we do?

1183
00:46:23,749 --> 00:46:25,449
- We have five minutes. - What are we supposed to do?

1184
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,009
We have five minutes.

1185
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:28,609
Start.

1186
00:46:28,609 --> 00:46:31,009
- Has it already started? - How do I do this?

1187
00:46:31,749 --> 00:46:33,379
(The search begins.)

1188
00:46:34,409 --> 00:46:37,809
(We're coming to get you.)

1189
00:46:37,809 --> 00:46:39,149
Stop him from moving.

1190
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,779
(They start the search at once.)

1191
00:46:46,009 --> 00:46:47,249
Open the doors!

1192
00:46:48,349 --> 00:46:49,409
In the front...

1193
00:46:49,409 --> 00:46:51,809
(Some of them start from the front.)

1194
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,649
- There's no one here, right? - Can they be in the trunk?

1195
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,249
Can they be in the trunk?

1196
00:46:55,409 --> 00:46:56,879
I didn't look in the trunk.

1197
00:46:57,509 --> 00:46:58,579
There's no one.

1198
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:03,349
(Kwang Soo is near them.)

1199
00:47:04,209 --> 00:47:05,949
(Ji Hyo focuses on opening the doors.)

1200
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:07,109
- They're not here, right? - Seok Jin.

1201
00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:08,649
I'll open the doors. You look.

1202
00:47:08,949 --> 00:47:10,979
- I'll open the doors. - There are only 30 vans.

1203
00:47:11,479 --> 00:47:13,249
- Seok Jin. - Look in the trunks.

1204
00:47:13,849 --> 00:47:15,509
We should check the trunks.

1205
00:47:15,509 --> 00:47:17,209
(Yong Man and Chun Hee are in danger.)

1206
00:47:17,509 --> 00:47:19,909
Look into the vans I opened. What are you doing?

1207
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:20,909
Look into the vans you opened?

1208
00:47:20,909 --> 00:47:23,179
- I've been opening the doors! - Okay.

1209
00:47:23,179 --> 00:47:27,679
(Will they be caught?)

1210
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,079
We should look in the trunks, too.

1211
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:33,379
(Seok Jin fails to spot them.)

1212
00:47:33,379 --> 00:47:35,509
It'll be impossible to find me.

1213
00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:38,279
- Where are they? - They're nowhere.

1214
00:47:38,749 --> 00:47:39,849
They're nowhere.

1215
00:47:39,949 --> 00:47:42,779
Do you think you can search for them with me on your back?

1216
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:44,779
Do you think I can't?

1217
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:47,009
Do you think you can?

1218
00:47:47,479 --> 00:47:48,609
Let's go.

1219
00:47:48,609 --> 00:47:51,679
(Moving)

1220
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:52,749
My goodness.

1221
00:47:53,279 --> 00:47:54,579
Jong Kook.

1222
00:47:55,479 --> 00:47:58,049
(It's my week. Why do I have to go through this?)

1223
00:47:58,049 --> 00:47:59,579
- My goodness. - The doors are open.

1224
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:00,749
Did they already look?

1225
00:48:00,749 --> 00:48:02,979
- This is not how you do it. - Yes, it is.

1226
00:48:02,979 --> 00:48:04,509
This is not how you do it.

1227
00:48:04,509 --> 00:48:06,149
It's supposed to be easy for me.

1228
00:48:06,609 --> 00:48:08,709
This is too exhausting.

1229
00:48:09,049 --> 00:48:10,479
We need to find them.

1230
00:48:12,479 --> 00:48:15,009
Don't exercise using me.

1231
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:17,079
Don't train your legs using me.

1232
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:18,379
(Exercising)

1233
00:48:18,379 --> 00:48:20,149
Don't train your legs using me.

1234
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:23,009
- This is impossible. - It's impossible.

1235
00:48:23,009 --> 00:48:24,049
(2 minutes remain and they haven't found anyone.)

1236
00:48:24,049 --> 00:48:25,109
Why is there no one?

1237
00:48:25,509 --> 00:48:26,609
Where are they?

1238
00:48:28,809 --> 00:48:29,879
There's no one.

1239
00:48:29,879 --> 00:48:31,349
(They have to win a hint this time.)

1240
00:48:31,449 --> 00:48:33,309
I thought someone was here.

1241
00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:34,549
There's no one.

1242
00:48:34,649 --> 00:48:35,909
We looked everywhere.

1243
00:48:35,909 --> 00:48:37,009
Where are they?

1244
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:38,509
Why is it so hard?

1245
00:48:38,509 --> 00:48:40,149
They just have to open all the cars.

1246
00:48:40,149 --> 00:48:42,209
I think I hear someone.

1247
00:48:42,309 --> 00:48:44,779
I'll act. I'll open the door to lure them.

1248
00:48:44,779 --> 00:48:46,709
If they find you, leave the van screaming.

1249
00:48:47,109 --> 00:48:50,849
(Will the bait strategy work?)

1250
00:48:50,949 --> 00:48:52,909
They just have to open all the cars.

1251
00:48:55,649 --> 00:48:57,049
(KCM tries to escape.)

1252
00:48:57,949 --> 00:48:59,079
Gosh.

1253
00:49:01,449 --> 00:49:03,149
(Catch me if you can.)

1254
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:07,509
(The bait is here.)

1255
00:49:08,709 --> 00:49:13,249
(He's running away to distract them.)

1256
00:49:13,249 --> 00:49:15,379
He shouldn't run away.

1257
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:18,649
You can't run away.

1258
00:49:20,949 --> 00:49:22,449
(He's caught.)

1259
00:49:22,449 --> 00:49:26,779
(KCM lets them arrest him while saving Won Hee.)

1260
00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:28,909
(Thank you, Mr. Bait.)

1261
00:49:28,909 --> 00:49:30,109
What should I do?

1262
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:32,349
You can't run away.

1263
00:49:32,349 --> 00:49:33,779
(They start looking for the others.)

1264
00:49:34,649 --> 00:49:36,449
(Kyung Hwan hears someone.)

1265
00:49:36,449 --> 00:49:37,979
You can't run away.

1266
00:49:39,149 --> 00:49:40,449
Is someone here?

1267
00:49:41,249 --> 00:49:42,749
I found one.

1268
00:49:42,809 --> 00:49:44,009
I found Kyung Hwan.

1269
00:49:44,709 --> 00:49:46,949
(That was close.)

1270
00:49:46,949 --> 00:49:48,009
I found him.

1271
00:49:48,249 --> 00:49:50,079
(They approach Chun Hee.)

1272
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,149
They're nowhere.

1273
00:49:51,149 --> 00:49:52,979
Can they be in the trunks?

1274
00:49:52,979 --> 00:49:53,979
(Frozen)

1275
00:49:54,649 --> 00:49:56,179
I didn't look in the trunks.

1276
00:49:57,149 --> 00:49:58,179
You're out.

1277
00:49:58,449 --> 00:49:59,449
Gosh.

1278
00:49:59,449 --> 00:50:01,649
- Chun Hee is out. - What is this?

1279
00:50:01,649 --> 00:50:02,879
(Team Running Man found 3.)

1280
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,509
- Chun Hee was here. - How did you know?

1281
00:50:04,509 --> 00:50:06,009
It was easy.

1282
00:50:07,249 --> 00:50:10,009
Yong Man is completely invisible.

1283
00:50:10,379 --> 00:50:12,849
It'll be impossible to find me.

1284
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:14,849
Where's Won Hee?

1285
00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:16,149
She's nowhere.

1286
00:50:16,909 --> 00:50:18,949
(Someone must be around here.)

1287
00:50:21,149 --> 00:50:24,179
(Ji Hyo is right in front of Yong Man.)

1288
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:25,649
I didn't look in the trunks.

1289
00:50:25,649 --> 00:50:26,879
(He might get caught.)

1290
00:50:27,049 --> 00:50:29,509
(Ji Hyo is near Yong Man.)

1291
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:33,509
(Yong Man is sitting in the front seat.)

1292
00:50:34,749 --> 00:50:38,709
(Yong Man is in danger. Will he get caught?)

1293
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:43,309
(Let me search your van.)

1294
00:50:46,649 --> 00:50:48,949
I found Yong Man.

1295
00:50:48,949 --> 00:50:50,809
- Gosh. - I found him.

1296
00:50:50,809 --> 00:50:53,809
(Ji Hyo found Yong Man with her gut feeling.)

1297
00:50:53,809 --> 00:50:55,949
- I found him. - Where was he?

1298
00:50:55,949 --> 00:50:57,249
(How did she find him?)

1299
00:50:58,149 --> 00:50:59,549
There's only five seconds left.

1300
00:50:59,549 --> 00:51:01,509
(He could have held out a few more seconds.)

1301
00:51:01,509 --> 00:51:02,509
It's unbelievable.

1302
00:51:03,249 --> 00:51:04,849
Ji Hyo is amazing.

1303
00:51:05,049 --> 00:51:07,249
(The search is over.)

1304
00:51:07,249 --> 00:51:09,549
We haven't found Won Hee.

1305
00:51:09,549 --> 00:51:11,079
Where's she?

1306
00:51:11,609 --> 00:51:12,909
(Here I am.)

1307
00:51:13,249 --> 00:51:17,009
(Team Running Man missed Won Hee.)

1308
00:51:18,349 --> 00:51:20,809
(Team Running Man found everyone except Won Hee.)

1309
00:51:20,809 --> 00:51:22,809
- Let's sing something easy. - It'll bring us together.

1310
00:51:22,809 --> 00:51:24,849
As we're Team Friends, let's sing "My Friend".

1311
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:25,979
("My Friend" by Insooni)

1312
00:51:25,979 --> 00:51:28,449
- It has rap. - Let's do it.

1313
00:51:28,449 --> 00:51:29,979
(Team Friends are singing "My Friend".)

1314
00:51:29,979 --> 00:51:31,049
Do something.

1315
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:32,809
The song started.

1316
00:51:33,449 --> 00:51:35,079
The door won't open.

1317
00:51:35,549 --> 00:51:37,809
What should I do? There's nowhere to hide.

1318
00:51:38,049 --> 00:51:40,709
I think it'll show.

1319
00:51:41,049 --> 00:51:42,779
Kwang Soo, what are you going to do?

1320
00:51:42,779 --> 00:51:44,749
Can I hide behind your legs?

1321
00:51:44,749 --> 00:51:46,809
- Here? - Yes.

1322
00:51:46,809 --> 00:51:48,049
I think it'll be hard.

1323
00:51:48,049 --> 00:51:49,049
(Struggling)

1324
00:51:49,909 --> 00:51:51,049
What should I do?

1325
00:51:51,049 --> 00:51:52,079
(He gave up right away.)

1326
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:53,249
The song is almost over.

1327
00:51:53,479 --> 00:51:56,409
(The song is almost over. They need to hide soon.)

1328
00:51:57,709 --> 00:51:59,509
(What's their score?)

1329
00:51:59,509 --> 00:52:01,349
It's 90...

1330
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:02,679
We got 100 points.

1331
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:05,179
(Their performance of friendship got 100 points.)

1332
00:52:05,179 --> 00:52:07,409
(They won 5 minutes.)

1333
00:52:07,409 --> 00:52:08,809
We don't have much time.

1334
00:52:08,809 --> 00:52:10,609
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can run.

1335
00:52:10,609 --> 00:52:11,879
(The search begins.)

1336
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:12,909
Push it.

1337
00:52:12,909 --> 00:52:15,049
(They have to find everyone to win.)

1338
00:52:15,249 --> 00:52:16,609
- There. - Hurry.

1339
00:52:16,609 --> 00:52:18,949
- Start from here. - From here?

1340
00:52:19,049 --> 00:52:20,309
Go through them one by one.

1341
00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:22,049
Turn on the light.

1342
00:52:22,449 --> 00:52:23,849
(Searching)

1343
00:52:25,249 --> 00:52:27,279
There's one. I found one right away.

1344
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:28,849
It's Ji Hyo.

1345
00:52:31,049 --> 00:52:33,349
(She runs away.)

1346
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:34,909
You're out.

1347
00:52:34,909 --> 00:52:37,609
(Ji Hyo got caught after 30 seconds.)

1348
00:52:37,609 --> 00:52:39,309
I was caught by you.

1349
00:52:39,309 --> 00:52:41,809
I got caught while looking at Jong Kook.

1350
00:52:43,149 --> 00:52:44,309
(Jong Kook was sending a signal to Ji Hyo.)

1351
00:52:44,809 --> 00:52:45,879
He's there.

1352
00:52:45,879 --> 00:52:47,249
(I found him.)

1353
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:49,079
(He's caught.)

1354
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:50,309
I'm caught, right?

1355
00:52:50,779 --> 00:52:51,949
Am I caught?

1356
00:52:53,049 --> 00:52:54,449
(Jong Kook got caught after a minute, too.)

1357
00:52:54,449 --> 00:52:56,549
- I'm caught. - I see.

1358
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:58,549
(I feel something.)

1359
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:03,309
Who's this?

1360
00:53:03,309 --> 00:53:04,909
- Who is this? - It's Seok Jin.

1361
00:53:05,109 --> 00:53:07,849
- I found Seok Jin. - I didn't know you'd find me.

1362
00:53:07,849 --> 00:53:09,549
I found Seok Jin.

1363
00:53:09,909 --> 00:53:11,149
(Someone's here.)

1364
00:53:12,149 --> 00:53:14,709
(What is this weird-looking creature?)

1365
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:16,909
(Laughing)

1366
00:53:18,679 --> 00:53:19,809
What is this?

1367
00:53:19,809 --> 00:53:20,849
(It's Kwang Soo.)

1368
00:53:20,849 --> 00:53:22,649
You're unbelievable.

1369
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:24,509
What is this?

1370
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:28,149
(He made himself more conspicuous.)

1371
00:53:28,149 --> 00:53:30,779
- How did you know it was me? - Gosh.

1372
00:53:31,049 --> 00:53:34,509
- How did you know? - How would I not know?

1373
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:35,649
I covered my head.

1374
00:53:35,649 --> 00:53:37,449
How did you know?

1375
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:39,349
- What is this? - I thought no one would know.

1376
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:40,809
It didn't work.

1377
00:53:40,809 --> 00:53:42,149
(Kwang Soo got caught with 1 minute left.)

1378
00:53:42,149 --> 00:53:44,679
- That was close. - Gosh.

1379
00:53:44,779 --> 00:53:48,079
(Haha is the only hope now.)

1380
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:50,479
Haha is playing a trick.

1381
00:53:50,779 --> 00:53:51,949
Excuse me.

1382
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:53,709
Look closely behind the drivers.

1383
00:53:53,779 --> 00:53:54,779
Is he not here?

1384
00:53:54,779 --> 00:53:56,649
(If they find Haha, they'll win the hint.)

1385
00:53:56,649 --> 00:53:57,709
Is he not here?

1386
00:53:58,149 --> 00:53:59,649
(Let's find Haha and win the hint.)

1387
00:53:59,649 --> 00:54:00,749
That's strange.

1388
00:54:01,509 --> 00:54:04,049
(They're approaching Haha.)

1389
00:54:04,049 --> 00:54:05,249
This is strange.

1390
00:54:05,979 --> 00:54:07,209
Are they here?

1391
00:54:07,609 --> 00:54:09,009
(He has to hold out just a little bit longer.)

1392
00:54:09,949 --> 00:54:12,609
Look closely. Check the front seat.

1393
00:54:12,609 --> 00:54:13,949
Is he not there?

1394
00:54:14,749 --> 00:54:17,209
How can he be nowhere?

1395
00:54:18,949 --> 00:54:20,949
This is impossible.

1396
00:54:20,949 --> 00:54:22,879
(Yong Man approaches Haha with 10 seconds left.)

1397
00:54:22,879 --> 00:54:23,909
Are there only 10 seconds left?

1398
00:54:24,349 --> 00:54:25,549
Excuse me.

1399
00:54:25,549 --> 00:54:26,949
(Let me search your van.)

1400
00:54:27,979 --> 00:54:29,409
(Gosh)

1401
00:54:31,049 --> 00:54:35,149
(Will he get caught or not?)

1402
00:54:36,149 --> 00:54:37,179
All right.

1403
00:54:38,749 --> 00:54:40,949
(Yong Man moves away.)

1404
00:54:40,949 --> 00:54:42,949
- Are there only 10 seconds left? - Only 10 seconds?

1405
00:54:42,949 --> 00:54:43,949
(That was close.)

1406
00:54:44,809 --> 00:54:46,509
(There are 5 seconds left.)

1407
00:54:49,449 --> 00:54:50,509
Did you find him?

1408
00:54:50,509 --> 00:54:51,709
(Where are you?)

1409
00:54:53,209 --> 00:54:55,149
Time's up.

1410
00:54:55,849 --> 00:54:57,349
They haven't found Haha.

1411
00:54:58,049 --> 00:54:59,949
Haha is great at hiding.

1412
00:54:59,979 --> 00:55:01,079
Where is he?

1413
00:55:01,609 --> 00:55:02,679
Where is he?

1414
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,449
That was incredible.

1415
00:55:04,749 --> 00:55:06,879
(Haha was hiding under the passenger seat.)

1416
00:55:06,879 --> 00:55:08,549
Thank you.

1417
00:55:08,549 --> 00:55:09,949
(Haha saved his team members' faces.)

1418
00:55:10,949 --> 00:55:12,009
This is unbelievable.

1419
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,179
(Team Friends found everyone except Haha.)

1420
00:55:13,179 --> 00:55:15,809
We have no choice.

1421
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,149
We'll have to have a singing competition.

1422
00:55:18,149 --> 00:55:20,849
- We're tied again. - Both teams got 100 points earlier.

1423
00:55:20,849 --> 00:55:25,309
I'm sorry to say this, but I looked down on them at first.

1424
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:27,249
- We shouldn't. - But you're amazing.

1425
00:55:27,249 --> 00:55:28,449
(Did you just judge us?)

1426
00:55:28,949 --> 00:55:31,709
You guys are clumsier than we expected.

1427
00:55:31,709 --> 00:55:33,309
(You guys are clumsy.)

1428
00:55:33,949 --> 00:55:35,949
Pick a member of the other team who should sing.

1429
00:55:35,949 --> 00:55:37,549
- Would that be okay? - Then...

1430
00:55:37,549 --> 00:55:39,949
- We choose Won Hee. - I think we'll win.

1431
00:55:39,949 --> 00:55:42,609
Won Hee will sing on behalf of Team Friends. Who do you choose?

1432
00:55:42,609 --> 00:55:45,349
- We choose Ji Hyo. - You choose Ji Hyo.

1433
00:55:45,349 --> 00:55:46,879
She's making that face again.

1434
00:55:46,879 --> 00:55:51,149
Won Hee and Ji Hyo's scores will...

1435
00:55:51,149 --> 00:55:52,749
determine the result of the third round.

1436
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:55,349
- All right. - Are songs with high notes better?

1437
00:55:55,349 --> 00:55:57,649
If you sing loud, you'll probably get a high score.

1438
00:55:57,649 --> 00:55:59,449
That's why we got a high score earlier.

1439
00:55:59,449 --> 00:56:01,549
- Try "Tears". - How does it go?

1440
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:04,509
(This song is known for extremely high notes.)

1441
00:56:04,509 --> 00:56:06,649
- Won Hee's going to sing "Tears". - Go to the center.

1442
00:56:07,349 --> 00:56:08,949
(She drinks water before singing.)

1443
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:10,449
Please make some room.

1444
00:56:10,449 --> 00:56:11,949
(This singing competition will determine the result.)

1445
00:56:11,949 --> 00:56:13,909
It's for your team.

1446
00:56:13,909 --> 00:56:15,509
- Your team's destiny depends on it. - Go for it.

1447
00:56:15,509 --> 00:56:16,749
("Tears" by So Chan Whee)

1448
00:56:17,109 --> 00:56:18,949
- All right. - Here we go.

1449
00:56:18,949 --> 00:56:21,709
(Let me introduce you to tonight's singer, Kim Won Hee.)

1450
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:24,709
(Walking)

1451
00:56:25,609 --> 00:56:27,609
(She sets the mood by walking sexily.)

1452
00:56:27,609 --> 00:56:28,679
Go, Won Hee!

1453
00:56:29,149 --> 00:56:30,779
(I have a good feeling.)

1454
00:56:30,779 --> 00:56:32,549
- Let's go. - You can do it.

1455
00:56:32,549 --> 00:56:34,949
(Give me the beat.)

1456
00:56:34,949 --> 00:56:36,479
Here we go.

1457
00:56:38,349 --> 00:56:41,309
(Everyone's having fun.)

1458
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:44,849
(Enjoying)

1459
00:56:44,849 --> 00:56:48,549
(How will she start the first line?)

1460
00:56:48,549 --> 00:56:49,609
Nothing!

1461
00:56:49,609 --> 00:56:53,809
- Nothing... Nothing has happened - Oh, no.

1462
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:56,909
(She stuttered.)

1463
00:56:56,909 --> 00:56:59,679
(It wasn't a good start.)

1464
00:57:00,909 --> 00:57:02,949
(She's calm again.)

1465
00:57:02,949 --> 00:57:06,349
(She's fully focused.)

1466
00:57:08,309 --> 00:57:10,249
(She's following the camera skilfully.)

1467
00:57:10,249 --> 00:57:14,509
(Her awesome stage presence is exciting the audience.)

1468
00:57:14,809 --> 00:57:16,549
Waiting for me

1469
00:57:16,549 --> 00:57:19,409
(Amazing vibration skills)

1470
00:57:19,409 --> 00:57:21,949
(That sounded very heartfelt.)

1471
00:57:21,949 --> 00:57:25,709
- Just hate me instead - Good.

1472
00:57:25,709 --> 00:57:28,409
- Hate! - Hate me!

1473
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:32,909
(Her voice is surprisingly addictive.)

1474
00:57:32,909 --> 00:57:35,049
- Don't show! - Good!

1475
00:57:35,979 --> 00:57:39,779
(The high notes are coming.)

1476
00:57:39,779 --> 00:57:40,909
(Here we go.)

1477
00:57:40,909 --> 00:57:42,379
Here we go.

1478
00:57:43,149 --> 00:57:45,909
(Are you ready for the climax?)

1479
00:57:45,979 --> 00:57:48,309
- Here we go. - Let's go!

1480
00:57:48,609 --> 00:57:50,049
Don't say

1481
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:52,449
I'm a cruel woman

1482
00:57:52,449 --> 00:57:54,779
(She pulled off the high notes.)

1483
00:57:54,779 --> 00:57:55,879
(The middle-aged man is having fun.)

1484
00:57:55,879 --> 00:57:58,909
It's for your sake

1485
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:00,809
(He's feeling the groove.)

1486
00:58:01,179 --> 00:58:02,179
Let's go.

1487
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:05,779
Don't forget my love

1488
00:58:05,779 --> 00:58:09,509
You're in my heart

1489
00:58:09,509 --> 00:58:10,609
(Perfect shouting)

1490
00:58:10,609 --> 00:58:12,309
It won't take long

1491
00:58:12,309 --> 00:58:13,749
(It is a passionate performance.)

1492
00:58:13,749 --> 00:58:15,179
Until your sadness goes away

1493
00:58:15,779 --> 00:58:18,809
(Kim Won Hee forever!)

1494
00:58:20,549 --> 00:58:22,249
(She's exhausted.)

1495
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:24,449
- What's the score? - What's the score?

1496
00:58:24,979 --> 00:58:26,909
- No. - Let's see.

1497
00:58:26,909 --> 00:58:28,809
(The queen of singing is born.)

1498
00:58:29,909 --> 00:58:31,149
(Thank goodness.)

1499
00:58:31,149 --> 00:58:32,809
You did it. It's a decent score.

1500
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:34,879
- It was higher than I expected. - Ji Hyo, you can do this.

1501
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,879
- A score of 82 is very high. - Be prepared.

1502
00:58:37,179 --> 00:58:39,079
I think I burst a capillary.

1503
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:41,049
(Shouting without proper instruction might cause high blood pressure.)

1504
00:58:41,049 --> 00:58:42,449
It's okay, Won Hee.

1505
00:58:42,449 --> 00:58:44,309
Everything was good except for the score.

1506
00:58:45,109 --> 00:58:46,609
- Ji Hyo can sing very well. - Really?

1507
00:58:46,609 --> 00:58:48,549
- I heard Ji Hyo is a good singer. - Will it be a close match?

1508
00:58:49,179 --> 00:58:51,479
- All right. - I will sing "Mr. Chu".

1509
00:58:51,609 --> 00:58:53,049
- "Mr. Chu". - That's nice.

1510
00:58:53,049 --> 00:58:54,709
It's a song by Apink.

1511
00:58:55,549 --> 00:58:57,909
- You can do this. - Dance, Ji Hyo.

1512
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,449
- How will she sing? - You are cool.

1513
00:58:59,449 --> 00:59:00,649
All right.

1514
00:59:00,649 --> 00:59:02,709
You look young.

1515
00:59:03,179 --> 00:59:05,679
- You look young. - Here I go.

1516
00:59:07,479 --> 00:59:09,349
- That's good. - Her voice is steady.

1517
00:59:09,509 --> 00:59:11,109
- We will lose. - Song Ji Hyo!

1518
00:59:11,149 --> 00:59:13,779
Even when I pinch my cheeks 2 and 3 times

1519
00:59:13,779 --> 00:59:14,909
- Song Ji Hyo! - Song Ji Hyo!

1520
00:59:14,909 --> 00:59:16,249
It's like dreaming, dreaming

1521
00:59:16,249 --> 00:59:17,479
My goodness.

1522
00:59:18,749 --> 00:59:21,779
(Here comes the highlight of cuteness.)

1523
00:59:21,779 --> 00:59:24,309
- Let's go. - In 1, 2, 3.

1524
00:59:24,309 --> 00:59:28,549
Mr. Chu, kiss on your lips

1525
00:59:28,549 --> 00:59:31,879
(Ji Hyo's unexpected charm brings everyone together.)

1526
00:59:32,749 --> 00:59:34,679
- Come to me secretly - Come to me secretly

1527
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:36,849
(Middle-aged men suddenly join in.)

1528
00:59:36,849 --> 00:59:38,909
- My goodness. - She is doing a good job.

1529
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:41,879
You are my one and only Mr. Chu

1530
00:59:41,879 --> 00:59:43,809
We don't know what her score will be.

1531
00:59:44,149 --> 00:59:46,409
- I think she did well. - Please let it be 83.

1532
00:59:46,409 --> 00:59:47,909
The winning team will be decided.

1533
00:59:47,909 --> 00:59:49,609
This is nerve-wracking.

1534
00:59:49,609 --> 00:59:51,479
(Which team will win and receive a hint on treasure?)

1535
00:59:51,979 --> 00:59:54,649
- The winning team will be decided. - This is nerve-wracking.

1536
00:59:54,649 --> 00:59:56,179
(You sang well.)

1537
00:59:56,179 --> 00:59:57,379
It's a bad score.

1538
00:59:57,749 --> 01:00:00,009
(The final score is 82 to 75.)

1539
01:00:00,009 --> 01:00:03,949
(Team Friends receives a prize and a hint on treasure.)

1540
01:00:05,209 --> 01:00:07,609
It's better to sing a song with high notes.

1541
01:00:07,609 --> 01:00:08,649
You did a good job.

1542
01:00:08,649 --> 01:00:11,609
- High notes have an advantage. - It was fun.

1543
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:13,509
You are lacking in many ways.

1544
01:00:13,779 --> 01:00:15,679
Even I didn't sing like you.

1545
01:00:16,049 --> 01:00:18,579
- She did a good job. - Won Hee was smart.

1546
01:00:18,579 --> 01:00:21,179
As promised, I will give you a prize of Round Three.

1547
01:00:21,179 --> 01:00:22,509
(The prize of Round Three goes to Team Friends as well.)

1548
01:00:22,509 --> 01:00:25,579
- We lost again. - They are good.

1549
01:00:25,579 --> 01:00:28,279
- Here is the prize I prepared. - It's inside a silver box.

1550
01:00:28,279 --> 01:00:29,709
I am so jealous.

1551
01:00:30,249 --> 01:00:31,809
It can't be helped.

1552
01:00:31,979 --> 01:00:33,109
I am excited.

1553
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:36,549
- Here is the prize I prepared. - It's inside a silver box.

1554
01:00:37,249 --> 01:00:39,709
- It's a tablet PC. - I knew it.

1555
01:00:39,749 --> 01:00:41,849
- Congratulations. - It's yours, Won Hee.

1556
01:00:41,849 --> 01:00:43,249
Thank you.

1557
01:00:43,509 --> 01:00:45,649
- All right. - Is a tablet PC inside?

1558
01:00:45,709 --> 01:00:48,579
- Can I open it? - No way.

1559
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:51,309
I shouldn't open it now. Thank you.

1560
01:00:51,309 --> 01:00:54,279
- Round Four starts now. - The prize will be a laptop.

1561
01:00:54,509 --> 01:00:57,679
- Jae Seok is cool. - Maybe there are two inside.

1562
01:00:57,679 --> 01:00:58,949
There is only one.

1563
01:00:59,279 --> 01:01:00,949
Will Round Four take place here?

1564
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:02,279
(Haha picked something up.)

1565
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:06,209
Will Round Four take place here?

1566
01:01:06,209 --> 01:01:07,409
(He steals the hint.)

1567
01:01:07,409 --> 01:01:09,579
- Stay quiet. - All right.

1568
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:11,649
They dropped the hint...

1569
01:01:11,649 --> 01:01:13,579
while dancing.

1570
01:01:13,579 --> 01:01:14,879
- Really? - Is that a hint?

1571
01:01:15,279 --> 01:01:16,709
Really?

1572
01:01:16,809 --> 01:01:19,309
What does it say?

1573
01:01:19,779 --> 01:01:21,409
It's green grasshopper.

1574
01:01:21,709 --> 01:01:23,079
- Really? - Yes.

1575
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,109
- What does it mean? - What is it?

1576
01:01:25,779 --> 01:01:28,479
It's incredible that we got this hint.

1577
01:01:29,249 --> 01:01:31,249
(During the singing competition five minutes ago)

1578
01:01:31,249 --> 01:01:33,549
(Grasshopper was dangling from his pocket.)

1579
01:01:34,409 --> 01:01:37,209
(It fell right away.)

1580
01:01:37,809 --> 01:01:40,349
(What's the new hint Team Friends received?)

1581
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,849
What is this?

1582
01:01:42,149 --> 01:01:44,379
- Wait a minute. - This is incredible.

1583
01:01:46,349 --> 01:01:47,779
- Inside the ship... - A washing machine?

1584
01:01:47,779 --> 01:01:50,509
must be a washing machine or laundry.

1585
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:52,649
- It could be laundry. - Laundry.

1586
01:01:52,879 --> 01:01:54,209
I don't think it's a ship.

1587
01:01:54,209 --> 01:01:56,109
- You don't think it's a ship. - I think...

1588
01:01:56,149 --> 01:01:58,909
it means Jae Seok's stomach.

1589
01:01:59,309 --> 01:02:01,179
- Jae Seok's stomach. - That's right.

1590
01:02:02,279 --> 01:02:04,479
Listen, everyone.

1591
01:02:04,479 --> 01:02:07,009
Team Running Man isn't doing so well in games.

1592
01:02:07,009 --> 01:02:08,609
We will win for certain this time.

1593
01:02:08,609 --> 01:02:12,479
The last round is "Telepathy with Jae Seok".

1594
01:02:13,209 --> 01:02:15,749
- Telepathy. - I don't know the questions.

1595
01:02:16,409 --> 01:02:19,179
The team with the same answer as mine will win.

1596
01:02:19,179 --> 01:02:20,949
(The team with the same answer as Jae Seok's answer will win.)

1597
01:02:21,179 --> 01:02:24,049
- We are confident. - There is only one question.

1598
01:02:24,049 --> 01:02:26,279
- This is nerve-wracking. - There is only one question.

1599
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,179
- All right. - Here is the question.

1600
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:31,379
When Jae Seok takes a shower,

1601
01:02:31,549 --> 01:02:33,779
which body part does he wash first?

1602
01:02:33,779 --> 01:02:35,409
(When Jae Seok takes a shower, which body part does he wash first?)

1603
01:02:35,409 --> 01:02:37,579
Which body part does he wash first?

1604
01:02:37,579 --> 01:02:39,679
(When Jae Seok takes a shower, which body part does he wash first?)

1605
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:44,449
(Where does Jae Seok wash first?)

1606
01:02:45,209 --> 01:02:47,309
- Wait a minute. - We can't write it.

1607
01:02:47,309 --> 01:02:48,549
We can't write it.

1608
01:02:48,649 --> 01:02:50,549
- What do you mean? - Can we write it?

1609
01:02:50,609 --> 01:02:53,409
- How precise do we need to be? - My goodness.

1610
01:02:54,409 --> 01:02:56,449
- He washes vigorously. - Like crazy.

1611
01:02:56,449 --> 01:02:58,009
(That's embarrassing.)

1612
01:02:58,009 --> 01:02:59,649
- I need to keep the answer clean. - It will air after all.

1613
01:02:59,649 --> 01:03:01,209
I will be straightforward with my answer.

1614
01:03:02,949 --> 01:03:05,379
- I will be straightforward. - Ji Hyo is speechless.

1615
01:03:05,379 --> 01:03:06,679
We know the answer.

1616
01:03:06,679 --> 01:03:09,009
- Ji Hyo is speechless. - We have known him for seven years.

1617
01:03:09,009 --> 01:03:11,109
- We know. - It has to be the right answer.

1618
01:03:11,509 --> 01:03:14,409
Yong Man has taken a bath with Jae Seok.

1619
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:16,349
Didn't you take a bath with him often?

1620
01:03:16,349 --> 01:03:17,909
- It has been many years. - That's right.

1621
01:03:17,909 --> 01:03:19,979
It has been a while since we went to a sauna.

1622
01:03:19,979 --> 01:03:22,349
- It has been over 10 years. - It has been 10 years.

1623
01:03:22,349 --> 01:03:25,709
At the count of three, lift up the answer.

1624
01:03:26,309 --> 01:03:28,849
In 1, 2, and 3.

1625
01:03:29,409 --> 01:03:30,609
(Face, head)

1626
01:03:30,609 --> 01:03:31,649
What did they write?

1627
01:03:31,779 --> 01:03:32,949
- Face? - We wrote, "Face".

1628
01:03:32,949 --> 01:03:34,379
We wrote, "Head".

1629
01:03:34,379 --> 01:03:37,349
- I have seen Jae Seok wash it. - We mean the entire head.

1630
01:03:37,909 --> 01:03:40,809
What's the answer? Jae Seok, lift up your answer.

1631
01:03:40,809 --> 01:03:42,679
In 1, 2, and 3.

1632
01:03:42,679 --> 01:03:44,249
(What could Jae Seok's answer be?)

1633
01:03:44,949 --> 01:03:49,049
(Which body part does he wash first in a shower?)

1634
01:03:49,049 --> 01:03:50,709
- In 1, 2, and 3. - Face.

1635
01:03:50,709 --> 01:03:52,149
(Face)

1636
01:03:52,149 --> 01:03:53,179
Face.

1637
01:03:53,179 --> 01:03:54,509
(Jae Seok's most precious body part is face.)

1638
01:03:54,509 --> 01:03:56,579
- It was face. - We are right!

1639
01:03:56,949 --> 01:03:58,649
(What about head?)

1640
01:03:59,079 --> 01:04:01,279
You should count "Head" as the right answer.

1641
01:04:01,509 --> 01:04:03,909
- I wash my face and head together. - I often take a shower with him.

1642
01:04:03,909 --> 01:04:07,009
Jae Seok washes his face and head together.

1643
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:09,709
Answers from both teams are correct.

1644
01:04:09,709 --> 01:04:11,549
- It's the right decision. - My goodness.

1645
01:04:11,549 --> 01:04:12,749
To be honest,

1646
01:04:12,749 --> 01:04:15,009
this isn't the right answer.

1647
01:04:15,609 --> 01:04:18,409
- Here is the right answer. - His hand moves south.

1648
01:04:18,409 --> 01:04:20,479
He does this.

1649
01:04:20,509 --> 01:04:22,509
He gently wets it.

1650
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:25,709
- My goodness. - Then he washes his hair.

1651
01:04:25,709 --> 01:04:26,779
(Running Man cheers for your shower.)

1652
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:28,049
Let's move on to the last question.

1653
01:04:28,309 --> 01:04:30,309
Here is the question. Which one...

1654
01:04:30,809 --> 01:04:33,009
is Jae Seok more confident about?

1655
01:04:33,449 --> 01:04:35,809
Face or personality?

1656
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:38,779
- Is there body? - This is too easy.

1657
01:04:38,949 --> 01:04:41,109
- Everyone can shout out the answer. - There is no doubt.

1658
01:04:41,479 --> 01:04:43,579
The entire nation will be able to get it right.

1659
01:04:43,709 --> 01:04:45,679
- It's his thought that matters. - Is that right?

1660
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:48,609
- He might think the same. - Will he write honestly?

1661
01:04:48,609 --> 01:04:50,549
He has conscience, right?

1662
01:04:50,809 --> 01:04:52,979
- I think so. - Let's leave it to his conscience.

1663
01:04:52,979 --> 01:04:54,649
I trust him to have conscience.

1664
01:04:54,649 --> 01:04:57,309
- He might lie to be funny. - This is hard.

1665
01:04:57,309 --> 01:04:58,979
He might choose the other one.

1666
01:04:59,209 --> 01:05:00,479
I think it's personality.

1667
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,809
- This can't be right. - Not his face.

1668
01:05:03,709 --> 01:05:06,809
He won't choose this one if he has conscience.

1669
01:05:06,879 --> 01:05:08,609
Please answer conscientiously.

1670
01:05:08,979 --> 01:05:11,779
I hope Jae Seok will answer with his hand over his heart.

1671
01:05:11,779 --> 01:05:13,679
- Me, too. - I trust him to have conscience.

1672
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:16,279
Raise your answers at the count of three.

1673
01:05:17,009 --> 01:05:20,049
- In 1, 2, and 3. - I hope he isn't shameless.

1674
01:05:20,379 --> 01:05:21,749
This must be what he wrote.

1675
01:05:21,749 --> 01:05:23,179
(Personality)

1676
01:05:23,179 --> 01:05:24,509
This must be what he wrote.

1677
01:05:24,509 --> 01:05:26,609
(Face)

1678
01:05:26,609 --> 01:05:28,279
(Personality versus face)

1679
01:05:28,279 --> 01:05:29,949
- His answer can't be face. - Jae Seok.

1680
01:05:29,949 --> 01:05:32,749
Raise your answer at the count of three.

1681
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:35,609
I say this with a hand over my heart.

1682
01:05:36,409 --> 01:05:38,809
When I look back on my life,

1683
01:05:39,449 --> 01:05:42,049
this is the logical choice between the two.

1684
01:05:42,379 --> 01:05:49,879
(Will Jae Seok's choice be his unique face?)

1685
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:56,409
(Will it be his considerate personality?)

1686
01:05:57,149 --> 01:05:59,479
(What did Jae Seok choose as his lethal charm?)

1687
01:05:59,479 --> 01:06:00,909
If he has conscience...

1688
01:06:01,609 --> 01:06:03,479
- What is his answer? - Show us.

1689
01:06:03,479 --> 01:06:04,679
(What did Jae Seok choose?)

1690
01:06:04,679 --> 01:06:07,849
- In 1, 2, and 3. - It has to be his answer.

1691
01:06:08,209 --> 01:06:09,649
He didn't lift it up right away.

1692
01:06:09,649 --> 01:06:13,549
(Jae Seok chose face.)

1693
01:06:13,549 --> 01:06:18,279
(Jae Seok has a nice face.)

1694
01:06:18,279 --> 01:06:20,249
- In 1, 2, and 3. - Face.

1695
01:06:20,379 --> 01:06:21,709
- My goodness. - Yes!

1696
01:06:21,709 --> 01:06:26,949
(Team Running Man's answer is correct.)

1697
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:29,109
- You are the absolute worst. - It's not personality.

1698
01:06:29,109 --> 01:06:30,709
- You are shameless. - It's not personality.

1699
01:06:30,709 --> 01:06:33,179
- How could you do that? - You are the national MC.

1700
01:06:33,179 --> 01:06:34,979
- It's not personality. - You are the national MC.

1701
01:06:34,979 --> 01:06:36,449
- It's not personality. - You succeeded because of it.

1702
01:06:36,449 --> 01:06:38,279
- You face didn't make you famous. - I think it's face.

1703
01:06:38,279 --> 01:06:40,079
- You are shameless. - My face.

1704
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,679
- It's my face. - You have problems.

1705
01:06:42,779 --> 01:06:44,809
You chose face. You know me well.

1706
01:06:44,809 --> 01:06:47,149
I am annoyed even though we got it right.

1707
01:06:47,149 --> 01:06:49,209
Even Team Running Man are annoyed.

1708
01:06:49,209 --> 01:06:51,779
- It's frustrating. - I don't care.

1709
01:06:51,949 --> 01:06:54,549
If I must choose between the two, it's face.

1710
01:06:54,549 --> 01:06:56,309
You have no conscience.

1711
01:06:57,049 --> 01:06:59,609
- My goodness. - I can't believe him.

1712
01:06:59,609 --> 01:07:02,609
Team Friends won prizes up to Round Three.

1713
01:07:02,649 --> 01:07:04,909
- The prize of Round Four... - A small car.

1714
01:07:04,949 --> 01:07:08,379
- goes to Team Running Man. - A small car?

1715
01:07:08,379 --> 01:07:13,949
(Team Running Man took a win. What will be the prize?)

1716
01:07:14,979 --> 01:07:19,079
(The prize of Round One was a set of vitamin supplements.)

1717
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:22,809
(The prize of Round Two was a set of Korean beef.)

1718
01:07:22,809 --> 01:07:27,549
(The prize of Round Three was a tablet PC.)

1719
01:07:27,549 --> 01:07:31,709
(What will be the prize of Round Four?)

1720
01:07:31,709 --> 01:07:34,079
(For goodness' sake!)

1721
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:35,449
(He throws it on the floor.)

1722
01:07:35,449 --> 01:07:38,249
- What is it? - Are you out of your mind?

1723
01:07:38,249 --> 01:07:39,709
It's my signed name tag.

1724
01:07:39,709 --> 01:07:41,449
It's Jae Seok's name tag.

1725
01:07:41,449 --> 01:07:42,809
(The prize of Round Four is Jae Seok's signed name tag.)

1726
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,809
- Are you out of your mind? - Are you serious?

1727
01:07:45,149 --> 01:07:47,279
- It suits the theme of the day. - Gosh...

1728
01:07:47,379 --> 01:07:51,149
(What's the last hint?)

1729
01:07:51,149 --> 01:07:54,409
You are supposed to have a nice personality.

1730
01:07:54,409 --> 01:07:58,449
(All the hints for the treasure have been distributed.)

1731
01:07:59,149 --> 01:08:01,349
- Let me see your navel. - Why do you want to see my navel?

1732
01:08:01,349 --> 01:08:02,949
(He is flustered.)

1733
01:08:02,949 --> 01:08:04,449
Paper ship.

1734
01:08:04,449 --> 01:08:09,479
(The hints from Round One and Two were paper ship and grasshopper.)

1735
01:08:09,479 --> 01:08:14,049
(The hint from Round Three was a care label for clothes.)

1736
01:08:14,049 --> 01:08:15,979
(Clothes, ship, grasshopper)

1737
01:08:15,979 --> 01:08:18,879
- What are you talking about? - You shouldn't have done that.

1738
01:08:18,879 --> 01:08:21,709
- What are you doing? - Come over here.

1739
01:08:22,149 --> 01:08:23,509
There is something.

1740
01:08:23,779 --> 01:08:25,149
- Wait a minute. - Let go.

1741
01:08:25,149 --> 01:08:27,249
- Get out of the way. - What is happening?

1742
01:08:27,709 --> 01:08:29,679
- What are you doing? - Microphone.

1743
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:31,549
What about the microphone?

1744
01:08:31,549 --> 01:08:33,479
(A hint for the treasure is somewhere on his clothes.)

1745
01:08:33,579 --> 01:08:34,649
What are you keeping from me?

1746
01:08:35,179 --> 01:08:36,279
What is going on?

1747
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:38,049
He took it away.

1748
01:08:38,049 --> 01:08:39,379
(They thoroughly search his body.)

1749
01:08:39,379 --> 01:08:40,479
What are you doing to me?

1750
01:08:41,479 --> 01:08:42,779
(Screaming)

1751
01:08:42,779 --> 01:08:45,549
- Where is it? - Take off his pants.

1752
01:08:45,549 --> 01:08:48,079
Won Hee, how can you say that to your friend?

1753
01:08:48,309 --> 01:08:50,279
(He gets goosebumps.)

1754
01:08:50,379 --> 01:08:51,549
- Take them off. - No!

1755
01:08:51,549 --> 01:08:53,709
(In the midst of public's roaring attention,)

1756
01:08:53,709 --> 01:08:55,779
(his clothes are taken off.)

1757
01:08:55,779 --> 01:08:58,409
(They take off his clothes rather forcefully.)

1758
01:08:59,209 --> 01:09:00,479
It's here.

1759
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:02,149
- What is happening? - Hey. It's in here.

1760
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:03,779
- Take it. - Hurry.

1761
01:09:03,809 --> 01:09:04,979
Hey. That's mine.

1762
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:06,549
(He has finally gotten wind of it.)

1763
01:09:06,549 --> 01:09:08,149
(It's a tight tug of war.)

1764
01:09:08,149 --> 01:09:09,749
- It's inside the clothes. - It's ours.

1765
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:17,709
(What is it that you need at a moment like this?)

1766
01:09:17,709 --> 01:09:20,509
(It's speed!)

1767
01:09:20,509 --> 01:09:23,709
(Jong Kook gets Jae Seok's clothes.)

1768
01:09:23,709 --> 01:09:26,379
(Run away with his clothes!)

1769
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:29,049
Jong Kook. Get in the car.

1770
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:30,909
Get in the car and lock it.

1771
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:33,379
Run. We have to run. Hurry.

1772
01:09:35,149 --> 01:09:36,879
Close the door. Close it!

1773
01:09:37,179 --> 01:09:38,179
Lock the door.

1774
01:09:38,179 --> 01:09:39,749
- Lock the door. - I did.

1775
01:09:39,979 --> 01:09:43,379
(Jong Kook manages to get inside the car.)

1776
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:44,479
"Yu Jae Seok".

1777
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:47,709
(What is the hint for the treasure hidden inside Jae Seok's clothes?)

1778
01:09:47,709 --> 01:09:49,809
(Yu Jae Seok's cameraman)

1779
01:09:49,809 --> 01:09:54,479
(Does Kwon Ryeol have the treasure?)

1780
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:55,479
(Ripping)

1781
01:09:55,479 --> 01:09:57,749
(He hides the hint first.)

1782
01:09:57,749 --> 01:10:00,209
Did you find it?

1783
01:10:00,209 --> 01:10:03,309
(When Team Friends surrounds Jong Kook,)

1784
01:10:03,309 --> 01:10:06,879
(Kwang Soo runs at his full speed to Kwon Ryeol.)

1785
01:10:06,879 --> 01:10:10,379
(Kwon Ryeol, give me the treasure.)

1786
01:10:10,379 --> 01:10:12,809
(What is happening now?)

1787
01:10:12,809 --> 01:10:13,879
What is it?

1788
01:10:13,879 --> 01:10:16,079
(Other members start to gather around him.)

1789
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:17,579
What is it? What do you know?

1790
01:10:17,579 --> 01:10:19,409
- Help me. - Come on.

1791
01:10:19,779 --> 01:10:21,509
She's bluffing. Go. Hurry.

1792
01:10:21,619 --> 01:10:23,709
Hurry. They already took it.

1793
01:10:23,709 --> 01:10:25,409
You are pretending, right? You don't have it, right?

1794
01:10:25,509 --> 01:10:26,509
Goodness.

1795
01:10:27,479 --> 01:10:28,679
Okay!

1796
01:10:30,379 --> 01:10:32,309
It's over!

1797
01:10:32,679 --> 01:10:34,379
Ji Hyo! We found it.

1798
01:10:34,379 --> 01:10:36,479
Ji Hyo found it!

1799
01:10:36,479 --> 01:10:38,149
(Team Running Man acquires the treasure.)

1800
01:10:38,549 --> 01:10:39,709
What is this?

1801
01:10:39,709 --> 01:10:40,809
(He's still confused.)

1802
01:10:41,149 --> 01:10:43,619
Jae Seok's cameraman had the treasure.

1803
01:10:43,909 --> 01:10:46,849
- What's going on? - You must be cold. Wear this.

1804
01:10:47,049 --> 01:10:49,479
- Put this on. Thank you. - How could you...

1805
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:51,279
Are you telling me now that I should put this on?

1806
01:10:51,749 --> 01:10:53,279
- You must be cold. - Are you okay?

1807
01:10:53,379 --> 01:10:55,879
Don't drop hints like this.

1808
01:10:55,879 --> 01:10:58,279
- Why would you lose hints? - I lost this before.

1809
01:10:58,279 --> 01:10:59,779
I lost this hint before.

1810
01:10:59,849 --> 01:11:01,579
I looked for this for so long.

1811
01:11:01,709 --> 01:11:04,119
Running Man, Member's Week.

1812
01:11:04,379 --> 01:11:06,149
It was Jae Seok's week.

1813
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:07,279
How can you call it's my week?

1814
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:08,879
(He's about to cry.)

1815
01:11:08,909 --> 01:11:10,779
- My gosh. - His clothes are all ripped.

1816
01:11:10,879 --> 01:11:14,009
You did what you wanted. You even have a nice outfit.

1817
01:11:14,009 --> 01:11:15,749
- I am so jealous. - Didn't you have fun?

1818
01:11:15,749 --> 01:11:17,679
- That's right. - You pretended to be generous...

1819
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,009
and gave us presents.

1820
01:11:19,009 --> 01:11:20,649
Now that I think about it, you are right.

1821
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:24,549
Everyone all gathered around you at the end. You are a powerful man.

1822
01:11:24,549 --> 01:11:25,909
(Even a film star can't get that much attention.)

1823
01:11:25,909 --> 01:11:27,709
- You're right. - Everyone clustered around you.

1824
01:11:27,709 --> 01:11:28,749
Everyone.

1825
01:11:28,749 --> 01:11:30,379
- You had fun, right? - Yes, we did.

1826
01:11:30,809 --> 01:11:32,479
I haven't filmed anything like this before.

1827
01:11:34,149 --> 01:11:37,279
As I told you before...

1828
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:38,979
Although I didn't know about the twist at the end,

1829
01:11:38,979 --> 01:11:42,809
my week with the people I love has delightfully finished.

1830
01:11:43,009 --> 01:11:45,049
I'd like to thank the five of you who joined us today.

1831
01:11:45,049 --> 01:11:48,209
- Thank you. - Next week will be Kwang Soo's.

1832
01:11:48,209 --> 01:11:51,209
(Please look forward to Kwang Soo's week.)

1833
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:54,509
It's the Member's Week of Running Man.

1834
01:11:55,309 --> 01:11:56,479
(The 7th host)

1835
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:59,809
(The last host is Lee Kwang Soo.)

1836
01:11:59,809 --> 01:12:01,549
Hello, members of Running Man!

1837
01:12:01,549 --> 01:12:04,879
I will give you a mission.

1838
01:12:04,879 --> 01:12:06,479
Until the midnight,

1839
01:12:06,749 --> 01:12:09,949
think about a trip we can take at night for me.

1840
01:12:09,949 --> 01:12:11,809
Then, come to the place where we film our opening segment.

1841
01:12:11,809 --> 01:12:12,809
(However)

1842
01:12:12,809 --> 01:12:13,949
Don't wear any makeup.

1843
01:12:14,379 --> 01:12:15,749
Don't do your hair.

1844
01:12:15,949 --> 01:12:18,309
Don't bring your manager or your stylist.

1845
01:12:18,309 --> 01:12:20,949
Running Man members, don't forget to come at 12am.

1846
01:12:20,949 --> 01:12:23,149
Viewers, my week will be...

1847
01:12:23,149 --> 01:12:25,709
I will bet everything I have and make sure...

1848
01:12:26,379 --> 01:12:28,149
I will absolutely make sure...

1849
01:12:29,049 --> 01:12:30,149
that I succeed this time.

1850
01:12:30,149 --> 01:12:31,209
Thank you!

1851
01:12:31,209 --> 01:12:34,209
(The last Member's Week will visit you.)

1852
01:12:34,209 --> 01:12:37,209
(Running Man)
