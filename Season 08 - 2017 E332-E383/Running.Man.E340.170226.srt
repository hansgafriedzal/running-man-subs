1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,240
It's Running Man Member's Week.

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,210
(The seventh and the last member is...)

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,810
(Lee Kwang Soo.)

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,940
(I get lonely often.)

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,010
(I am lonely all day long, but it gets worse at night.)

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,910
(I want a travel plan for myself as I live alone.)

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,710
(I'd like a night tour to fill in my loneliness.)

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,480
(And...)

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,310
(there has to be a penalty this week.)

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,280
(I am always the one to be doubted first. I'm sick of it.)

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,380
(Maybe there could be a twist...)

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,740
(so that the members won't be suspicious of me.)

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,710
You can make some kind of system.

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,840
(If you fail this time,)

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,580
(I will be fighting against the staff.)

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,110
(I look forward to my Member's Week.)

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,780
(That's how Kwang Soo's Week started.)

18
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,840
Hello, members of Running Man!

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,340
I will give you a mission.

20
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,040
Until midnight,

21
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,440
think about a trip we can take at night for me.

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,210
Then come to the place where we film our opening segment.

23
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,210
(However)

24
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,280
Don't wear any makeup.

25
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,040
Don't do your hair.

26
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,810
Don't bring your manager or your stylist.

27
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,240
Running Man members, don't forget to come at 12am.

28
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,510
Viewers, during my week,

29
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,380
I will bet everything I have and make sure...

30
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,880
I will absolutely make sure...

31
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,710
that I succeed this time.

32
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,210
Thank you!

33
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,080
(This is how Kwang Soo disclosed his surprise mission.)

34
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,910
(That night at 11:52pm...)

35
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,780
(Mokdong SBS)

36
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,940
(Somehow, they look grubby.)

37
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,080
Why?

38
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,180
(They're not dressed up.)

39
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,610
It's midnight.

40
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,180
(They have minimalist looks.)

41
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,610
Put your microphones on.

42
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,310
Why did you wear a long, padding coat?

43
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,940
It might get cold.

44
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,210
- Why not? - How can you wear that to a shoot?

45
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,540
It's because I had to wear my own clothes.

46
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,310
(He's wearing clothes he'd wear to a shop nearby.)

47
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,910
(Someone arrives in a taxi without his manager.)

48
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,280
Thank you.

49
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,680
(Haha is full of annoyance.)

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,780
So why did you call me all of a sudden?

51
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,880
What are we doing now?

52
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,010
I came as soon as I finished another shoot.

53
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,910
This is my second shooting today.

54
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,050
What are we doing in the middle of the night?

55
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,810
Haha is here.

56
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,580
He looks shabby.

57
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,810
What's with those blue pants?

58
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,510
Are you going to a morning soccer club?

59
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,480
Are you playing soccer?

60
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,910
- You deserve a penalty. - It's fashion.

61
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,810
- It's fashion. - Just don't say anything.

62
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,210
(His fashion is friendly and stylish.)

63
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,280
- Oh, my. - People will go crazy over this.

64
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,010
- They might go mad. - You're sometimes so out of style.

65
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,910
- It's Ji Hyo. - Are you all right?

66
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,440
- Well... - Why did he call us at night?

67
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,510
He's here. He's here.

68
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,640
- Jong Kook. - He's here.

69
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,480
I worked out my legs today because I thought I'd have no shooting.

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,110
I can't even walk well.

71
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,840
Why do you exercise until you can't walk?

72
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,380
Why would you?

73
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,910
- How much do you exercise? - This is bad.

74
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,210
You only worked out your legs?

75
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,940
- What is that? - What is that?

76
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,480
(The scum is here.)

77
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,910
- I don't want to see him again. - What is he doing?

78
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,710
(Because the day was good, because the day was bad,)

79
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,610
(because it was just right. It's a good day for a Member's Week.)

80
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,540
Hello.

81
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,710
(Goblin Kwang enters.)

82
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,810
What is this?

83
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,010
- Why aren't you in your clothes? - Why aren't you dressed casually?

84
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,110
(Why are you dressed up?)

85
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,080
- Are you wearing your own clothes? - Yes.

86
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,010
- Did you put makeup on? - You're wearing makeup.

87
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,840
- I did. - Why did you?

88
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,110
(I'm the main character.)

89
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,210
By the way, I have to sleep now.

90
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,310
- Why did you call me at midnight? - Jae Seok.

91
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,310
- I'm sleepy. - Even the weather is bad today.

92
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,380
- Why is it raining today? - I know, it's raining.

93
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,210
It's your week. Do as you want.

94
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,080
It better be fun. I'll be watching.

95
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,380
How can I do anything about it?

96
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,640
Calling me at midnight is okay. But I'll be watching you.

97
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,640
All right.

98
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,010
It's 12am now.

99
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,310
We will start Kwang Soo's Week.

100
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,680
Please give a big hand.

101
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
(Kwang Soo's Week begins.)

102
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,640
I will if you say so.

103
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,280
(Annoyed)

104
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,610
You have to introduce one by one your night tour course...

105
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,710
that you've thought of.

106
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,740
Kwang Soo will choose four according to his preference.

107
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,140
- That's right. - After completing all the trips,

108
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,040
if you return to SBS by 6am, it will be considered as a success.

109
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,350
- Really? - If you fail to return in time,

110
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,410
- there will be a terrible penalty. - A terrible penalty?

111
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,610
So please try to be punctual.

112
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,710
(This terrifying punishment is...)

113
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,710
It is the tallest in Korea.

114
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,480
(The tallest bungee jump scared Haha and Jae Seok to death.)

115
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,140
(We will escort you to another one this morning.)

116
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,710
(If they fail, they will be sent straight to do bungee jumping.)

117
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,040
(As soon as their trip starts, the countdown will begin.)

118
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,540
(However, the members are not aware of this fact.)

119
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,710
Is that all?

120
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,510
Today,

121
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,110
as we told you previously, we are going to...

122
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,040
have a night tour.

123
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,350
A night tour?

124
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,280
Is this all?

125
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,110
The members always doubted and suspected me.

126
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,710
I wanted some tricks to get even. Aren't there any?

127
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,710
Of course, we have prepared a hidden rule.

128
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,710
A hidden rule?

129
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,610
(This element of surprise will catch them off guard.)

130
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,880
(What can this hidden rule be?)

131
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,980
Moreover, the members whose trips are selected...

132
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,380
will receive a special benefit.

133
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,410
The key point is to make sure the trip is to Kwang Soo's liking.

134
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,510
This is true.

135
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,610
- He has to approve of the trip. - So...

136
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,310
Kwang Soo has to like the trip.

137
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,210
You should have behaved like this long before.

138
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,640
We will select the first course.

139
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,010
If I choose one,

140
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,910
there will be added points.

141
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,940
Kwang Soo only likes specific things.

142
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,280
(A throne is brought out for him to sit.)

143
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,910
You probably already know. Thank you.

144
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,480
- You're desperate to become a king. - Thank you. Goodness.

145
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,240
I haven't seen this for a while.

146
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,910
This is my week, and there will be extra points.

147
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,980
- Kwang Soo has to like it. - We have to please you?

148
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,310
I had a lot of possible destinations in mind.

149
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,680
I decided on Kwang Soo's home at the end.

150
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,580
- I bet you will place last. - I didn't know about this.

151
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,640
- He didn't want to stay at home. - You're right.

152
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,840
- Did you really decide on my home? - No, I didn't.

153
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,680
I also thought of his house.

154
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,680
(To be honest, Kwang Soo has a bad memory regarding his house.)

155
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,410
(In May, 2015, they forcefully let themselves in.)

156
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,710
(Screaming)

157
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,380
(He had no choice but to reveal his privacy during the shoot.)

158
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,010
Why are you doing this to me?

159
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,010
Did everyone...

160
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,310
They were lazy.

161
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,310
Hey.

162
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,840
Why did you pick my house?

163
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,940
- Hey, your house... - Don't bring my house into this.

164
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,710
- By the way... - Don't come to my house anymore.

165
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,210
You don't know what Kwang Soo likes.

166
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,610
- You are clueless. - I can take away points.

167
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,780
Kwang Soo, aren't you feeling a bit hungry?

168
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,710
- I was feeling slightly hungry. - I knew it.

169
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,340
- Are you planning to... - Do you want some tteokbokki?

170
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,380
(It is the perfect late-night snack for Kwang Soo.)

171
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:09,440
(Kwang Soo, I will show you the paradise for snack bar food.)

172
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,880
- I do like snack bar food. - You do?

173
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,110
- Kwang Soo does like them. - It's too late...

174
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,680
- to eat that. - He almost won me over, too.

175
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,180
- I have a place in mind, too. - Where is it?

176
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,140
I went there a while ago and had so much fun.

177
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,680
- It's the fish market. - It's Noryangjin...

178
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,710
Hey, I'm supposed to tell him.

179
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,610
- He told me. We went together. - I should be telling him.

180
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,710
- Fish market. - There, we can see raw fish.

181
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,240
- We can pick fish and eat it. - Raw fish is great.

182
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,210
- This will be great. - I know Kwang Soo well.

183
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,240
It's amazing.

184
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,580
- You don't know him at all. - Why?

185
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,810
- He likes raw fish. - At this hour, raw fish isn't good.

186
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,540
- Kwang Soo. - No, it's the perfect time for it.

187
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,880
- I am not sure. - It's all protein.

188
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,310
It's great. He likes raw fish.

189
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,910
So far, we have snack bar and fish market.

190
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,010
Let's go for meat.

191
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,110
(Haha suggests meat.)

192
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,040
(Hold on. Did you just say meat?)

193
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,840
(Raw fish? Tteokbokki? Forget it.)

194
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,680
- I will buy you beef. - Beef?

195
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,880
- Did you say beef? - Hey.

196
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,310
I will buy you doenjang jjigae with beef brisket.

197
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,710
- We have three choices so far. - The time's perfect.

198
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,880
I heard this place is popular these days.

199
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,710
I heard rooftop bars are trending.

200
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,980
(Would you like to have a dance party at a trendy place?)

201
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,210
I heard G-Dragon often visits that bar.

202
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,640
- Don't say things like that. - Then let's not go there.

203
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,010
- You will ruin the mood at the bar. - G-Dragon...

204
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,080
- What are you talking about? - Let G-Dragon enjoy it.

205
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,180
- What are you implying? - You aren't good enough for it.

206
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,240
- That's right. - You can't go there.

207
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,480
Let's just go to the fish market.

208
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,880
It suits us. Let's go and have some delicious food.

209
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,080
- Let's go to the fish market. - Let's head to Dongdaemun.

210
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,140
- I know an incredible place. - Let's go shopping.

211
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,110
- Eat something nutritious. - Think about a fish this big.

212
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,040
Imagine having a raw fish sliced.

213
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,580
The chef with 30 years of experience is slicing the raw fish.

214
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,280
- How about snow crabs? - Snow crabs?

215
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,180
There are snow crabs, too?

216
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,540
- There are all kinds of seafood. - Of course.

217
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,950
Besides, you know what?

218
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,640
It takes a while to cook snow crabs.

219
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,040
- No, it takes 15 minutes. - They have it cooked already.

220
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,140
- It takes 15 minutes? - Yes, it does.

221
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,540
- It's edible undercooked. - Besides...

222
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,180
Tteokbokki is served right away.

223
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,240
- Tteokbokki sounds good. - I asked you that.

224
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,450
What is your decision?

225
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,710
(Let me think.)

226
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,450
(The 1st possible place is Seok Jin's fish market.)

227
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,580
(The 2nd possible place is Jae Seok's snack bar.)

228
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,980
(The 3rd possible place is Ji Hyo's rooftop bar.)

229
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,310
(The 4th possible place is Haha's meat restaurant.)

230
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,610
(It's a dilemma. What's his decision?)

231
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,780
It's Noryangjin fish market!

232
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,910
(Seok Jin's fish market has been selected.)

233
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,040
- Great. - That's it.

234
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,540
- This is good. - This isn't bad.

235
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,380
- This is... - That will be the first course.

236
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,840
- We are wasting time. - Right. Let's eat first.

237
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,310
- We have three more places. - Exactly.

238
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,540
(Remaining time)

239
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,010
(They must rush to Noryangjin.)

240
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,310
- We have to be back by 6am? - Let's go to nearby places.

241
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,540
- That's right. - You have booked the place, right?

242
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,610
I am going to book it.

243
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,280
You don't have to do anything. I will take care of everything.

244
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,180
If you don't want raw fish, we have other options.

245
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,680
I can also introduce you to the tasty world of seashells.

246
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,010
You won't regret this.

247
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,450
- It's chewy when it's cooked. - It sounds delicious.

248
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,840
Indeed, it is delicious.

249
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,180
(The seafood paradise is still bright at night.)

250
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,610
(Noryangjin's fish market is full of night air and fresh scent of sea.)

251
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,610
All right. I am introducing you to this fish market.

252
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,180
Kwang Soo, please come this way.

253
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,310
Hello.

254
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,510
(He tries to book a seafood restaurant.)

255
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,080
- Nice to meet you. - Hello. Nice to meet you.

256
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,780
- We must have steamed seashells. - Right. With steamed seashells...

257
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,450
I am in charge of this area today.

258
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,010
- Do you serve steamed seashells? - Of course.

259
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,910
Aren't they delicious around this time?

260
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,140
- How about steamed snow crabs? - We serve that, too.

261
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,380
(It will be a shame to only eat seashells and snow crabs.)

262
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,280
The scallops look so tasty.

263
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,240
- Steamed scallops are good, too. - That's fine.

264
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,040
You should choose since you are the host of this week.

265
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,080
Even though we are tight on time, we'll include...

266
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,580
snow crabs!

267
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,240
- All three of them. - Great!

268
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,910
- Let's go. - Let's go now.

269
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,340
- I can't wait. - Add the seashells.

270
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,680
I did. Thank you.

271
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,710
- Let's go. - Gosh.

272
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,610
Sir, try this.

273
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,240
- Imagine you are... - What did you say?

274
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,280
Imagine you are having this with seafood noodles, sir.

275
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,380
- Why are you flattering him? - Kwang Soo.

276
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,540
Try some.

277
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,480
- Why are you... - I should've done this for my week.

278
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,680
- He likes to be flattered. - Look at this.

279
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,610
- That's true. I do like it. - He likes to be treated well.

280
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,880
But still...

281
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,910
It's nice to be here though, right?

282
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,710
- We are eating altogether. - Until when do we have to wait?

283
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,680
- Please manage your time well. - All right.

284
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,310
- I don't know who will be next. - I should manage the time.

285
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,110
- You're right. - We have to eat fast.

286
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,240
During the shoot,

287
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,410
if you want to play games, let's go to an arcade.

288
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,240
It won't take long to get there.

289
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,640
- In Hongdae... - I have...

290
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,710
- We can go play table tennis. - Excuse me.

291
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,310
- Sir. - How about table tennis?

292
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,510
(He tries to convince Kwang Soo.)

293
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,140
- What are you doing here? - Hey, Jae Seok.

294
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,210
- Stop cheating. - Can we switch seats?

295
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,240
(Haha wants to switch seats.)

296
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,880
How can we convince you when he's next to you?

297
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,580
(This is why everyone wanted their week so badly.)

298
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,910
(Steamed seashells are served.)

299
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,640
All right. Here's the first mission.

300
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,880
- What? - What?

301
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,980
(Hold on. What mission?)

302
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,940
(The first mission is introduced out of the blue.)

303
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,610
- What's happening? - Is there only one plate?

304
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,610
- You will get one plate. - I see.

305
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,680
- Can we eat? - We can eat, right?

306
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,310
- Dip it in chojang, everyone. - Should I?

307
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,610
I don't have any.

308
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:21,980
Here it is.

309
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,880
Gosh. This is delicious.

310
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,310
- It's tasty. - It is, isn't it?

311
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,440
- Try other dishes, too. - This is good.

312
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,140
- I can put this here and... - How delicious.

313
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,680
- It's good. - Isn't it?

314
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,610
- Have this, sir. - Who made it possible to eat this?

315
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,410
- You should have this and... - Kwang Soo made it possible.

316
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,010
- It's all thanks to Kwang Soo. - I made this happen.

317
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,610
- Who thought of this idea? - But I...

318
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,310
came up with the idea of this week for you to have this idea.

319
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,810
Can we have more seashells?

320
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,910
- You have failed the first mission. - What?

321
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,480
(What on earth is this mission that we failed?)

322
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,180
- We will start the second mission. - What did you say?

323
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,710
(Starting the second mission, a plate of seashells is served.)

324
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,710
(There is another mission?)

325
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,510
- Does Kwang Soo have to eat first? - No. Eating together isn't it.

326
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,580
(It sounds about right.)

327
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,510
- Hold on. He has to eat that part? - That's right. Feed him.

328
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,580
(Let Kwang Soo eat first.)

329
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,280
- I guess we have to eat that part. - No. They can't predict that.

330
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,040
Wait. Perhaps, we have a time limit to finish eating.

331
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,910
- He's looking at his clock. Hurry. - Let's hurry.

332
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,910
- What did you say? - Is that it?

333
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,580
We ate this before.

334
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,480
(They come up with various guesses.)

335
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,910
- What is that? - We are done.

336
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,810
(They finish eating quickly.)

337
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:27,840
We are done eating.

338
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,510
We will start the third mission.

339
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,080
(They've failed the third mission. They are bewildered.)

340
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,980
If you can't accomplish the mission, you can't go to the next place.

341
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,640
- Those snow crabs... - What could the mission be?

342
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,140
This is an escaping game.

343
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,980
They are purposely trying to delay us.

344
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,240
But what is the mission?

345
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,440
Is this a hint?

346
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,540
(A hint is given.)

347
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,310
"Hashtag, Lee Kwang Soo".

348
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,880
(The hint is Lee Kwang Soo.)

349
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,180
(The mission has to be about me.)

350
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,910
Could it be his feeding us?

351
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,240
- Kwang Soo. - What if it's swallowing after him?

352
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,140
- Or maybe he needs to eat first. - Maybe he needs to feed himself.

353
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,610
Maybe he needs to feed us.

354
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,840
- Maybe he has to eat all of it. - Or he has to feed us all.

355
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,210
- First of all, we should... - Kwang Soo.

356
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,480
How can you be in the dark if you came up with this idea?

357
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,080
- Don't let them drag you around. - I didn't plan this part.

358
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,680
(This hidden mission which the host isn't even aware of is...)

359
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,080
(If Kwang Soo has the last bite, the mission is accomplished.)

360
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,980
- Don't be a pushover. - Is this your revenge?

361
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,210
Is this your revenge?

362
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,280
- No, I'm not. - Are you trying to stop us...

363
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,780
from clearing the mission?

364
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,710
- I thought about taking revenge. - He must be a spy.

365
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,680
I've done it so much, so I decided not to.

366
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,780
Jong Kook is starting to get upset.

367
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,380
That doesn't make sense.

368
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,140
I don't understand, so help us understand.

369
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,710
This is my Member's Week.

370
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,710
Do you want to be kicked out without clothes on?

371
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,640
- Can you do that? - Yes.

372
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,380
- You can do whatever you want. - Right.

373
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,910
Here's the mission for the third time.

374
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,210
Here's the king crab.

375
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,210
We get to eat because of Kwang Soo.

376
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,680
Thank him and enjoy it.

377
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,410
- Thank you. - Give everyone a leg each.

378
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,580
How many legs are there?

379
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,480
- There are 6. - I'll give 1 each.

380
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,210
- Thank you. - I'll give one each.

381
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,540
- Thank you. - Give everyone a leg. Thank you.

382
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,310
I think that's the mission.

383
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,180
(Despite being nervous, they enjoy the king crab.)

384
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,510
You're penalized if you can't remove the shell.

385
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,580
(Despite being nervous, they enjoy the king crab.)

386
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,980
What if Kwang Soo has to feed us?

387
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,610
(Did they clear the mission?)

388
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,640
- Did we clear the mission? - We did.

389
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,010
- Did you finish? - Yes.

390
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,510
- Did you finish? - Yes.

391
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,010
See? We cleared the mission.

392
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,240
Here's the next hint.

393
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,140
- Okay, that wasn't it. - Come on.

394
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,710
I told you that wasn't it.

395
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,510
Should I be the only one eating?

396
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,710
Here's an important hint.

397
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,710
- Is there another one? - We need the hint.

398
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,140
- "Yield". - "Yield".

399
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:34,110
(The second hint is yield.)

400
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,780
- We must yield to Kwang Soo. - He should yield to us.

401
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,010
- I yield to you? - You shouldn't eat.

402
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,540
- You shouldn't eat. - Only the rest of us eat.

403
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,210
Kwang Soo shouldn't eat.

404
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,040
I'll be furious if this is the mission.

405
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,240
- You can't eat, Kwang Soo. - Don't eat.

406
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,680
You shouldn't eat.

407
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,980
Everything we ordered is what I wanted to eat.

408
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,240
- That's right. - That's the mission.

409
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,510
- This is it. - Right.

410
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,940
I guess it is.

411
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,610
Everyone knows that Kwang Soo yields.

412
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,480
- He's impressive. - He's so generous and caring.

413
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,980
- He's amazing. - I agree.

414
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,480
- Right? - It's true.

415
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,410
We ordered what I wanted.

416
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,880
The mission is ordering the dishes you like.

417
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,140
- You share with others. - You share with other members.

418
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,640
- That's what yielding is. - He's so generous.

419
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,610
- What do you mean? - You're an angel without wings.

420
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,340
He's loving like a mother.

421
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,180
It's good to hear that.

422
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,610
He's like a mother who yields food to her children.

423
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,310
Did you finish the dish?

424
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,910
- Will rice be served after? - We finished.

425
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,840
- Did you finish the dish? - We finished.

426
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,710
- Did you finish the dish? - Did you finish?

427
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,780
You're very close to clearing the mission.

428
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,580
- See? - What did we do?

429
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,180
(What did he do?)

430
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,310
(Kwang Soo took the last piece of the crab.)

431
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,040
- Kwang Soo has to eat the last. - He has to eat the last piece.

432
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,210
We understand.

433
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,880
We'll give him the leftovers.

434
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,140
- We just give him the leftovers. - That's right.

435
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,540
Okay.

436
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,540
- It's fried rice with crab meat. - Goodness.

437
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,680
It looks delicious.

438
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,710
- Let's do it. - Okay.

439
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,010
Leave this much for Kwang Soo.

440
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,710
- It's his last bite. - He gets the last bite.

441
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,780
I really like that dish.

442
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,310
(Thanks to Kwang Soo, they enjoy a seafood course meal.)

443
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,080
It's delicious.

444
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,310
(Kwang Soo's week is the best.)

445
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,880
I really like that dish.

446
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,940
Leave some for Kwang Soo.

447
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,810
Are these the leftovers? Do I get to finish?

448
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,710
- Go ahead. - You should eat it.

449
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,680
The leftovers are for you. I must say it out loud.

450
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,380
Finish everything.

451
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,710
He's doing a good job of finishing it.

452
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,710
- It's delicious. - Take the last bite.

453
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,410
(He eats the last bite perfectly with some kimchi.)

454
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:47,480
(Time passed as they failed to clear the mission.)

455
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:53,910
(They still have three courses left.)

456
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,150
The mission is cleared.

457
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,840
(They barely clear the 1st hidden mission.)

458
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,180
- Shall we go? - We cleared the mission.

459
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,180
The first course...

460
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,340
was selected by Seok Jin.

461
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,780
As I mentioned, you get a benefit when your suggestion is chosen.

462
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,080
Only you can read it.

463
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,010
Don't share it with others.

464
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,010
(Kwang Soo prepared it.)

465
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,180
The benefit is very special, so please keep it with you.

466
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,310
(What is the special benefit Seok Jin received?)

467
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,410
- You can throw it away. - Can we read it?

468
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,240
- I can't throw it away. - What is it, Seok Jin?

469
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,710
I can't tell you.

470
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,840
- Show us. - I can't.

471
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,680
Show us if you can't tell us.

472
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,540
Do you think I'm a pushover?

473
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,280
(How dare you say that?)

474
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,780
- Really? - Goodness.

475
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,180
- Please sit. Don't attack him. - Stop it.

476
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,810
- What's wrong with you? - Calm down.

477
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,380
- What's the matter with you? - How can I calm down?

478
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,210
- I'm getting upset. - You're acting strange.

479
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,080
- I'm so upset. - What's wrong?

480
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,510
- His face is flushed. - How could you say that?

481
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,380
Now that we ate, let's go and exercise.

482
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,440
How about a baseball field?

483
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,910
- How about a baseball field? - We mentioned it before.

484
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,410
How about playing baseball on the screen?

485
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,710
- A shooting range. - Let's play table tennis.

486
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,440
- A shooting range in Hongdae. - How about an arcade?

487
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,650
We can eat again when we get hungry after playing games.

488
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,310
Kwang Soo, how about a shooting range in Hongdae?

489
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,580
- It's really fun. - A shooting range.

490
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,810
I'll decide.

491
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,380
We should do what Kwang Soo can play well.

492
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,280
- It should be what I like. - Shooting is really fun.

493
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,680
It's very popular because you can win big dolls.

494
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,410
- He won 100-dollar worth of dolls. - You can win dolls.

495
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,410
Hurry up.

496
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,610
(The clock is ticking.)

497
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,650
It's really fun.

498
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,110
(There are 4 candidates.)

499
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,680
- Choose my suggestion. - I choose the arcade.

500
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,880
(He takes Jae Seok's suggestion.)

501
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,610
- We should play... - This is awesome.

502
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,710
- the claw crane. - We should play that.

503
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,940
- Let's go. - We don't have time.

504
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,380
- Take my suggestion next time. - Let's go.

505
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,510
(Second course is the arcade.)

506
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,610
Listen, Kwang Soo.

507
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,610
We're making great memories.

508
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,210
- I know. - They'll be unforgettable.

509
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,880
- Thank you. - It's an early morning trip.

510
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,910
- Yes. - That's right.

511
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,380
We're doing something when everyone else is sleeping.

512
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,380
Everyone else is sleeping right now.

513
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,180
It's like a secret trip.

514
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,150
- That's right. - After everyone falls asleep

515
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,680
- I will love you - I will love you

516
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,540
- You're such an old generation. - Without anyone knowing

517
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,310
(They sing an old song by Kim Won Jun.)

518
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,510
- Gosh. - We all know the lyrics.

519
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,440
The song was released in early 90s.

520
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,810
It's 1:45am.

521
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,540
We'll leave the arcade by 2:30am.

522
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,010
- Then we'll have patbingsu. - That sounds delicious.

523
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,680
That will be perfect.

524
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,180
How about foot massage, Kwang Soo?

525
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,580
I like foot massages too.

526
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,880
- I like foot massages too. - I can give you one now.

527
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,940
How about a foot massage in warm water?

528
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,410
- Let's do that. - You're trying so hard, Haha.

529
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,610
Let's find an arcade in Hongdae.

530
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,710
Do you know a place?

531
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,880
- We can play claw crane here. - Here it is.

532
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,310
- Let's go there. - It's also deserted.

533
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,150
- Even on Sunday, it's crowded. - It's full of people.

534
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,310
- It's so busy here. - What's going on here?

535
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,010
- Is it a club? - They're waiting in line for a bar.

536
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,610
- It's too crowded here. - Right?

537
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,910
- Let's go to the last one. - Shall we?

538
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,480
- Let's do that. - It wasn't crowded there.

539
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,810
- How about here? - It looks great.

540
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,650
- Isn't this great? - This part of Hongdae is empty.

541
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:56,650
- Is it claw crane? - No one is working there.

542
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,580
- Let's go. - This is a great place.

543
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,410
- Okay. - This is good.

544
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,910
It's a great place.

545
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,940
It's nice and empty. There's no one here.

546
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,480
Here's the mission for the second course.

547
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,040
Kwang Soo, please step up.

548
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,610
- Only me? - Yes.

549
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,210
What is it?

550
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,240
Here's your secret mission.

551
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,340
If you disclose this mission,

552
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,480
your penalty will double.

553
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,840
- It must be a mission for us. - I think so.

554
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,710
You must clear it in secret.

555
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,210
(What's the mission for Kwang Soo?)

556
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,240
(Each member has to do something for Kwang Soo.)

557
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,340
Gosh, it's not easy at all.

558
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,980
(He must choose wisely to save time.)

559
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,680
Your success...

560
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,980
depends on Kwang Soo.

561
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,210
What is it?

562
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,880
- Kwang Soo. - Is it guessing the order?

563
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,910
It's either probability or order.

564
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,980
I think he decides the order in which we play claw crane.

565
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,710
(Please think before talking.)

566
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,210
- Is it the number of dolls? - We must clear...

567
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,780
- the mission quickly. - Kwang Soo.

568
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,710
- This is our second course. - Jae Seok is good at it.

569
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,210
I'm not bad either.

570
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,340
I love Pink Panther.

571
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,510
It's ugly.

572
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,010
(He finishes the list.)

573
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,240
- These aren't random. - Kwang Soo.

574
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,440
They're based on their habits and what happened today.

575
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,110
(Jae Seok has to win a doll for me.)

576
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,980
(Seok Jin has to kiss me on the cheek.)

577
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,140
(Jong Kook has to lend me a mask. Haha has to give me a foot massage.)

578
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,010
(Ji Hyo has to wipe off when I spill water.)

579
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,940
The mission starts now.

580
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,440
What should we do, Kwang Soo?

581
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,710
Just start because I can't tell you anything.

582
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,710
- Just start? - Yes.

583
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,840
- I can't tell you. - If you win the game, you pass.

584
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,480
I'm addicted to playing claw crane these days.

585
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,180
- Give me some money. - Right.

586
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,140
- What? - Give me some money.

587
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,840
- Give me some money. - Give us two dollars each.

588
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,110
- Were you keeping 50 dollars? - Give me some.

589
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,440
Give us two dollars each.

590
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,580
- Give me 10 dollars. - Give me some.

591
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,710
Just give us 10 dollars each.

592
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,540
- Why are you so greedy? - Goodness.

593
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,810
Please start playing.

594
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,110
- Can I start? - Yes.

595
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,610
- Act freely. - I'll start.

596
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,980
- Okay. - Jae Seok.

597
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,710
- I'll get the white one. - Here I go.

598
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,710
Let's go, Jae Seok.

599
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,880
- I'm good at this. - Please win a doll.

600
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,940
He's cheering for Jae Seok for a reason.

601
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,780
Jae Seok has to clear the mission.

602
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,980
(He cheers for Jae Seok who's good at playing claw crane.)

603
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:07,040
(Jae Seok has to win a doll for me.)

604
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,380
- Please get it. - He's close.

605
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,680
- He got it. - I should do that.

606
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,380
(Jae Seok is amazing at playing claw crane.)

607
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,510
I'm addicted to playing claw crane these days.

608
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,840
Let me get one for Kwang Soo. That's right. I got you.

609
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,480
(Will he clear the mission easily?)

610
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,480
You almost got it.

611
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
(Dropping)

612
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,980
No way.

613
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,010
You have more chances left.

614
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,310
That was the second attempt.

615
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,480
- I spent a lot of money. - There we go.

616
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,180
I caught one.

617
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,340
That's right.

618
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,340
(He drops it.)

619
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,080
It's driving me crazy.

620
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,380
(It's not as easy as he thought.)

621
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,880
(Kwang Soo watches Haha.)

622
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,240
Here I go.

623
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,240
- My goodness. - Haha.

624
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,240
- That's right. - Haha.

625
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,610
Let's continue our conversation we had in the car.

626
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,510
The next course is very important.

627
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,510
(Do you remember?)

628
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,710
(Haha has to give me a foot massage.)

629
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,240
(A conversation took place in the car.)

630
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,780
- I like foot massages too. - I can give you one now.

631
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:11,080
(Let's eat patbingsu as I recommended.)

632
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,310
(Remember your promise?)

633
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,310
- I'll be honest with you. - Okay.

634
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,710
- I have two things in mind. - That's right!

635
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,310
- Patbingsu or foot massage. - All right.

636
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,240
Let's go with patbingsu.

637
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,240
(Is it that simple?)

638
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,680
It's important where we go.

639
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,280
Let's go with patbingsu. It's right next door.

640
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,680
- But I really want a foot massage. - Great job.

641
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,880
- Don't go with foot massage. - All right.

642
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,540
- I don't need any hot water... - Foot massage...

643
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,610
I'll do it for you.

644
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,310
- That's it. - Really?

645
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,810
- That wasn't fair. - Do I have to do it now?

646
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,610
- I want to know how good you are. - This is driving me nuts.

647
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,840
I can do it but we have to focus on this game now.

648
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,240
(He doesn't understand.)

649
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,810
- I'll do it now. - Can you?

650
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,710
(Kwang Soo keeps on being bossy,)

651
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,440
(so Haha agrees.)

652
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,980
You volunteered to do it.

653
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,580
Great job.

654
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,580
(Punching)

655
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,610
(Haha tries to impress Kwang Soo.)

656
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,110
You get to play twice, dummy.

657
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,510
- I can always do it for you. - That's good.

658
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,140
- I know. - There you go.

659
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,880
(Kwang Soo completes his mission with Haha.)

660
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,040
I kept on using my coins.

661
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,640
(Who's next?)

662
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,080
That worked.

663
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,780
(He spots Ji Hyo.)

664
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,680
(Ji Hyo has to wipe off when I spill water.)

665
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,140
(She's a nice person.)

666
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,640
- So... - I got it.

667
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,980
(He starts spilling water on himself.)

668
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,380
(Spilling)

669
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,610
(She starts wiping water off.)

670
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,180
(He completes his mission with Ji Hyo right away.)

671
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,640
- No, Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

672
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,180
(She always takes care of him.)

673
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,240
Kwang Soo.

674
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,280
- I won something. - This is a hint.

675
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,540
- I won something. - You won this?

676
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,110
- Yes. - I didn't get one yet.

677
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,040
(Seok Jin has to kiss him on the cheek.)

678
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,040
- Did you win this? - I did.

679
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,540
(Seok Jin is proud.)

680
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,080
I did.

681
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,810
- Seok Jin. - I'm serious.

682
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,380
(Kwang Soo acts like he's touched.)

683
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,080
(Smacking)

684
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,040
(Seok Jin has to return the kiss.)

685
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,640
(Smacking)

686
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,640
Thank you.

687
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,640
(He's satisfied.)

688
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,580
(Was that good, Kwang Soo?)

689
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,080
You can't lie.

690
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,980
- I'm so happy right now. - Really?

691
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,080
(Seok Jin is happy.)

692
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,210
- Okay. Should I go for a big one? - I got three.

693
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:16,140
(He completed his missions with Seok Jin, Haha, and Ji Hyo.)

694
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,880
(There are 3 hours and 45 minutes left for Jae Seok and Jong Kook.)

695
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,340
(Jae Seok keeps on missing.)

696
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,380
I almost had two.

697
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,610
(Let me go with Jong Kook first.)

698
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,710
(Coughing)

699
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,540
- All right. - I keep coughing.

700
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,810
I'm getting worried.

701
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,340
I think I'm catching a cold.

702
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,710
Kwang Soo is coughing. That's strange. What's going on?

703
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,240
(I told you I'm feeling sick.)

704
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,810
It's not working.

705
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,780
(Look at me.)

706
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,680
Do you have any more change?

707
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,780
(Are you going to keep ignoring me?)

708
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,140
(Jae Seok stares in his direction.)

709
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,580
Can you give me some change?

710
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,680
(Stop coughing and give me change.)

711
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,580
Get some change.

712
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,540
- He wants to take my money. - I'll get you some change.

713
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,540
(He tries to borrow Jong Kook's mask by saying he caught a cold.)

714
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,680
- I'll be back. - That's not it.

715
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,880
- Jong Kook. - Get me some change, Kwang Soo.

716
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,610
- I'll be back. - Sure.

717
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,640
Should I just go?

718
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,180
(I need something warm, Jong Kook.)

719
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,240
Go.

720
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,280
(Just go.)

721
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,680
(This won't work.)

722
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,440
(He plans to borrow the mask to disguise himself.)

723
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,980
Hurry up, Kwang Soo.

724
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,810
There are a lot of people. Would I be okay?

725
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,140
(He doesn't care.)

726
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,840
- I need a cap or a mask. - That's right.

727
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,580
(I need that thing...)

728
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,480
(on your chin.)

729
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,280
Hey.

730
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,380
(Take my cap.)

731
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:46,480
(You're kind only at times like this.)

732
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,340
Kwang Soo.

733
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,580
(They're so clueless.)

734
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,340
Okay.

735
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,140
(He heads to a convenience store to get change.)

736
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,640
Hello.

737
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,440
Do you have masks by any chance?

738
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,810
(He'll get it himself and make Jong Kook hand it over to him.)

739
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,880
I can give it to him...

740
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,910
and make him give it back, right?

741
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,640
Kwang Soo.

742
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,510
(Time is ticking and he still has two missions to complete.)

743
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,880
- Did you see how it dropped? - I don't have too much change.

744
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,040
(How do I hand this over to him?)

745
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,310
Here's your change.

746
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,040
- Why are you giving this to me? - I got it.

747
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,240
- Why? - I don't have too much change.

748
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,710
It worked.

749
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,480
- Am I not supposed to talk? - Sorry?

750
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,640
What does this mean?

751
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,680
(He doesn't understand what Kwang Soo is doing.)

752
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,580
If this doesn't work...

753
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,610
(Do you get what I want?)

754
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,780
It's 2. I won 2.

755
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,640
Stop doing this.

756
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,910
- Focus on me. - Pardon?

757
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,880
- It's my Member's Week. - So?

758
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,140
(Coughing)

759
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:47,140
You're coughing too hard.

760
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,810
(Does he get it now?)

761
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,680
(Is this my mission?)

762
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,780
You...

763
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,580
(You never disappoint me.)

764
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,580
(He completes Jong Kook's mission. There's only Jae Seok left.)

765
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,480
It's my first time winning something ever.

766
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,780
- Really? - It's my first time.

767
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,240
(They are impressed over their wins.)

768
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,910
I won two puppies.

769
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,480
Kwang Soo, wait for me. I'll win something for you.

770
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,810
How long do I have to wait? It's been over an hour.

771
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,880
- Look at me. I won 2. - Jae Seok.

772
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,310
- What's wrong with you today? - This one's good.

773
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:23,280
This one will work. That was so difficult.

774
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,710
That was so difficult.

775
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,810
That's right.

776
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,480
(You're more than just clueless.)

777
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,810
I'll win you something. Don't worry.

778
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,510
Kwang Soo. I won something again.

779
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,680
(Praise me, Kwang Soo.)

780
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,510
(Congratulations)

781
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,540
You're on a roll.

782
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,540
(Am I 1st place right now?)

783
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,510
- Kwang Soo. - I'm so happy.

784
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,980
(I'll give you a peck. You can take some rest.)

785
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,680
- Let's do this. - Thank you.

786
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,140
This will work.

787
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,140
(Jae Seok is unsuccessful again.)

788
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,510
Can you get me some change, Kwang Soo?

789
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,910
- Kwang Soo. - Did you win again?

790
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,680
- What's up with you? - I'm so good at this.

791
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,780
Why are you so good?

792
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,280
- You can stop. - This is insane.

793
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,240
(I won three this time.)

794
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,140
(Please stop.)

795
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,780
(He gives him a peck for the 4th time.)

796
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,280
Okay.

797
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,280
- Kwang Soo. - I must be really bad at this.

798
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,680
Kwang Soo.

799
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,410
- There you go. - Shut your mouth.

800
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,640
What's wrong? I won eight.

801
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,980
Do you know how much money I used on this?

802
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,480
You're the only one who didn't win anything.

803
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,640
Exactly. I'm trying to win it for you.

804
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,480
Try a different machine.

805
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,640
I'm so close with this one.

806
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,280
This is how you go broke.

807
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,140
- Stop losing it. - Hey.

808
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,680
Don't you like Pink Panther?

809
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,080
- I do... - Hold on then.

810
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,580
- We have 3 hours and 30 minutes. - Fine.

811
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,380
We have two more places to go.

812
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,080
I won, Kwang Soo.

813
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,180
Come to your senses. Please come to your senses.

814
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,540
Don't you know what the penalty is?

815
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,440
(Something is waiting for us in Inje.)

816
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,040
- You can catch that one. - Get the blue one.

817
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
Let's do it.

818
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,780
(He's focused.)

819
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,440
- Yu Jae Seok. - Yu Jae Seok.

820
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,310
This one's for certain.

821
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,640
You got it.

822
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,980
(Would he succeed this time?)

823
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,380
(Please)

824
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,210
- You got it. - You got it.

825
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,910
- You got it. - Yes.

826
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,780
(He succeeds.)

827
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,540
(He finally did it.)

828
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,540
(He didn't know it was going to take this long.)

829
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,280
Aren't you happy?

830
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,780
(They're this happy over a stuffed animal.)

831
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,610
- Let's move on. - Is that good?

832
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:32,440
- Jae Seok. - You completed the mission.

833
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,580
(That concludes the missions at the arcade.)

834
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,180
(There are three and a half hours left.)

835
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:41,440
Jae Seok, your suggestion was chosen as the second place,

836
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,640
so you win a hint. It's just for you.

837
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,280
- Look at it by yourself. - It's just for you.

838
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,640
(What's this?)

839
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,610
Do we choose the next place?

840
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,680
- The third place... - Let's go for tteokbokki.

841
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,940
(Let's go for tteokbokki.)

842
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,710
- Okay. - Tteokbokki?

843
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,640
- Tteokbokki is first on the list. - Let's go for tteokbokki.

844
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,640
- Very tasty waffles... - No.

845
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,140
- and patbingsu. - Waffles and patbingsu?

846
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,880
And ice cream.

847
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,240
- What about udon? - Udon.

848
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,680
(That sounds good.)

849
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,080
- I'm craving for udon. - What was that?

850
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,380
- Let's get udon at a food stall. - Why udon all of a sudden?

851
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,880
I choose udon.

852
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,010
(Ji Hyo is the host for the next round.)

853
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,480
I swear I was going to call tteokbokki.

854
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,710
- Jong Kook, I was going to do it. - I'm sorry.

855
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,680
- Did you see Ji Hyo's face? - It's because of the rain.

856
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,440
- I was going to say tteokbokki too. - She surprised me.

857
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,610
Do you have a place in mind, Ji Hyo?

858
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,340
Do you know a good place?

859
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,540
Yes, I do. Turn right at the next traffic light.

860
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,810
All the food stalls there are gone.

861
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,040
- Really? - Yes.

862
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,140
They're all gone.

863
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,780
(That's an unexpected situation.)

864
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,540
You're talking about the one across from the hospital, right?

865
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,710
- They're all gone. - Kwang Soo,

866
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,680
if we went for tteokbokki, it would have been next door.

867
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,940
That's not good.

868
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,180
- There it is. It's next to the cab. - Is it?

869
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,480
- Where? - There it is.

870
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,910
(She finds a food stall.)

871
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,540
- It's there. - It is.

872
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,140
- There it is. - They have udon.

873
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,880
(This is what they had in mind.)

874
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,180
- They would have it for certain. - There it is.

875
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,880
I hope they have udon.

876
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,480
Please.

877
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,210
- Hello, ma'am. - Hello. Do you have udon?

878
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,480
We don't.

879
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,240
You don't?

880
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,640
- What about just noodles? - We don't.

881
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,840
What now?

882
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,410
(They don't have udon. What now?)

883
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,380
- They don't have udon. - Let's go for any udon.

884
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,180
Hold on.

885
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,210
You said udon at a food stall.

886
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,480
We can go to a different food stall.

887
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,880
You don't have to be so inflexible.

888
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,140
(We're not doing this because we're afraid of the penalty.)

889
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,910
This happens. It could be difficult to find things at late night,

890
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,540
so we prepared to give you a chance.

891
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,280
- I see. - We were mistaken. We're sorry.

892
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,380
- We really like udon. - You're a nice person.

893
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:45,380
Many places are closed on Sunday nights.

894
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,280
- That's right. - So we're giving you a chance.

895
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,610
Choose 1 of the 2 cards.

896
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:52,080
- Do I pick one? - Kwang Soo does?

897
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,380
It's a special chance.

898
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,810
(There are two cards.)

899
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:55,980
Choose the one at the bottom.

900
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,640
There's a reason it's at the bottom.

901
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,710
(They have to be very careful about it.)

902
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,480
This is up to what's written inside, not my will.

903
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,680
(There are many restrictions due to the time.)

904
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,880
(This card is supposed to help them at situations like this.)

905
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,280
(What did Kwang Soo pick?)

906
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,880
Friend Card.

907
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,810
- Friend Card? - If there's anyone still up,

908
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,480
you can ask that person for an udon place.

909
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,410
(They have to go to an udon place Kwang Soo's friend recommends.)

910
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:22,410
(At this hour?)

911
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:23,580
The thing is,

912
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,050
we're awake because we're on a trip.

913
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,240
- But it's 3am now. - Everyone's asleep.

914
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,910
It's Sunday, too.

915
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,640
- Exactly. - It'd be rude of me to call.

916
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,580
Aren't we Kwang Soo's friends?

917
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,780
We're his friends.

918
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,510
I'm your friend.

919
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,550
Seok Jin is your friend.

920
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,280
He is.

921
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,550
Are you my friend?

922
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,710
Yes, I am.

923
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,510
Mapo Station is right around the corner.

924
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:50,410
Can we exchange cards?

925
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,110
I'll give you this.

926
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,140
It's what I got.

927
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,140
Do you want to...

928
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,440
- switch to another card? - Yes.

929
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,550
It must be a difficult one.

930
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:06,280
(What's the other card?)

931
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,610
- Night Bus Card? - What's that?

932
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,340
(Are we taking a bus at this hour?)

933
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,940
Have you heard of night buses?

934
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
- Yes. - No.

935
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,550
(There are buses that run only late at night.)

936
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,280
- Take any night bus. - And then?

937
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,680
Throw a dice. The number you get will be the number of stops...

938
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,940
you have to move. You'll have to find an udon place there.

939
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,810
We'll take the Friend Card.

940
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:30,140
- Give it back. - You can't do that.

941
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,340
Give it back to us.

942
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,880
That's what we picked.

943
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,710
Take this and give us the card.

944
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,910
Take this.

945
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,510
We picked the Friend Card.

946
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,340
Wake someone up.

947
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,240
Whom should I call?

948
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,410
We have to go somewhere near here. We don't have much time.

949
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:48,240
All stores are closed, and everyone's asleep.

950
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,580
- Send a text first. - Wait.

951
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,050
Bo Young seems to be awake.

952
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,610
- Who? - Park Bo Young.

953
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,580
(Are you talking about the one and only Park Bo Young?)

954
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,940
(Is this cute woman awake at this hour?)

955
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,710
- Try calling. - All right.

956
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,640
- Let's call her. - Does she have your number?

957
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,180
- Text her. - Tell her to say Hapjeong-dong.

958
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,640
Say that Mapo has the best udon.

959
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,710
And then call her.

960
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,780
If she says Gangnam, we'll have to go there.

961
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,810
- Text, "Mapo has the best udon." - Do that.

962
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,710
- I'll call her. - Call her.

963
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,410
Put it on speaker.

964
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:28,240
(Bo Young, please pick up if you can hear me.)

965
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,610
- Hello? - Bo Young.

966
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,010
(Bo Young picked up.)

967
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,210
Where are you?

968
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:36,110
I'm in Paju.

969
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,550
Are you shooting?

970
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,910
- In this cold? - It's late.

971
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,610
- Hi, Bo Young. - It must be cold.

972
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,180
- Hi. - I miss you.

973
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,080
- Hi. - We're shooting, too.

974
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,910
We're shooting Running Man.

975
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,880
- Did you read my message? - No.

976
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,640
- Read it. - Read it.

977
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,610
I'm sure you don't want to read Kwang Soo's message.

978
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,980
Why didn't you read it before taking the call?

979
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:58,080
- Just ask her. - Bo Young.

980
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,810
Bo Young. Udon...

981
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,440
(Bo Young, about that udon...)

982
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,280
(Their night depends on Bo Young's answer.)

983
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,080
(Will they have to cross the Han River or not?)

984
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,710
(What does udon mean to her?)

985
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,410
The best udon is in Mapo.

986
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,780
(You know your udon well.)

987
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,380
Exactly.

988
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,240
- My question wasn't finished. - Bo Young.

989
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,710
- Thank you so much. - The best udon is...

990
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,110
- in Mapo. - In Mapo.

991
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,410
It must be very cold there.

992
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,840
It must be cold there, too.

993
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,380
Still, where's the best udon?

994
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,610
In Mapo.

995
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,410
(The best udon is in Mapo.)

996
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,710
Thank you.

997
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,480
- Thank you, Bo Young. - Bye.

998
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,280
- Goodbye. - Let's hurry.

999
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,380
We should send a picture of us having udon to Bo Young.

1000
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,380
Let's get it done and go home.

1001
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,550
Are we going to Mapo?

1002
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,410
(They set off to try udon in Mapo.)

1003
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,110
It's possible. We can do it.

1004
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,510
Don't worry. I'll make it.

1005
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,140
There's not much time left.

1006
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,180
I'm worried.

1007
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,710
It must be this way.

1008
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,610
Look to the left.

1009
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:57,310
- Does it have to be a cart bar? - Wait.

1010
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,710
I found it.

1011
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,180
Go straight.

1012
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,180
Do you remember something?

1013
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,210
Right there.

1014
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,010
- It's there! - Right there!

1015
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:06,680
(Did they find an udon place?)

1016
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,780
- It's open! - It is!

1017
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,550
We found it.

1018
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,410
(They find an udon place.)

1019
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,310
(They arrive at an udon place in Mapo.)

1020
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,980
Let me show you.

1021
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,640
Cameramen,

1022
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,240
please take a close-up shot of the word "udon".

1023
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,340
Right there.

1024
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,440
(We need to take this.)

1025
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,280
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1026
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,710
Hello.

1027
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,710
(Ji Hyo asks them for help.)

1028
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:30,140
We're shooting Running Man.

1029
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:35,110
We have a mission to have udon.

1030
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,810
Please.

1031
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,510
I really want to have it.

1032
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,310
- We have to have it. - I'm going crazy.

1033
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,880
If the owner doesn't allow us, let's shoot outside.

1034
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,280
- We have to have it. - We'll have takeout.

1035
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,010
We could eat outside. Did it work?

1036
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,910
Well...

1037
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,510
The owner is not here.

1038
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:54,710
As long as we don't shoot the employees, we can shoot here.

1039
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,440
Thank you. It's done.

1040
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,080
Thank you.

1041
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,680
Thank you. We're sorry.

1042
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,680
- Thank you. - We're sorry to bother you.

1043
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,010
- We're sorry. - We're sorry.

1044
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,140
We'll keep quiet.

1045
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,310
This place has a nice feeling.

1046
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,140
(They enter the restaurant.)

1047
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,710
They close at 4am. We could have missed it.

1048
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,080
- They close at 4am. - We could have been late.

1049
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,680
The mission at this restaurant...

1050
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,710
- is extremely simple. - What is it?

1051
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,140
Turn this roulette.

1052
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,210
The chosen ones will have udon, and that's it.

1053
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,980
- Really? - Will it be only one person?

1054
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,550
You'll see soon.

1055
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,680
What?

1056
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,840
(How does the roulette look?)

1057
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,380
It's Kwang Soo versus the other five.

1058
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,640
- It's either Kwang Soo or us. - It's either him or us.

1059
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,780
(Kwang Soo or the other five? That is the question.)

1060
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,810
This is crazy.

1061
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,550
I mean...

1062
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,050
Kwang Soo.

1063
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:50,240
Wait. Why are you doing this? It's my week.

1064
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,510
Shouldn't there be all of our names?

1065
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,340
- Let's just do it. - Let's do it.

1066
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,440
They need to take customers.

1067
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,140
- Let's do it. - They need to take customers.

1068
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,310
I'll do it...

1069
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,680
- Ready. - really seriously.

1070
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,340
- We have to eat it. - Turn it hard.

1071
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,910
(This whole tour must have started for this udon.)

1072
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,080
(They're all desperate.)

1073
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,140
Turn it hard.

1074
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,140
(It's turned.)

1075
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,880
(Their fate changes every 0.1 second.)

1076
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,210
(Please let me eat udon.)

1077
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:18,610
(It's a cruel game.)

1078
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,710
(Who will have a warm bowl of udon?)

1079
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,840
Yes!

1080
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,980
(It is Kwang Soo.)

1081
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,550
- Do it again. - You didn't say, "Start."

1082
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,180
- You didn't turn it properly. - It was a bit...

1083
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,110
Turn it hard.

1084
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,440
(What is going on?)

1085
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,010
(Everyone is his enemy.)

1086
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,710
- You should say, "Start." - Turn it this hard.

1087
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,840
- Turn it hard. - Okay.

1088
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,110
Say, "Start."

1089
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,680
Start.

1090
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:44,410
- I said it, okay? - All right.

1091
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,280
I think I'm going to cry.

1092
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,240
Do it.

1093
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:49,880
Turn it hard.

1094
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,410
(It's real this time.)

1095
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,140
Turn it hard.

1096
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,080
(Kwang Soo turns it hard.)

1097
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,240
(No mistake is allowed.)

1098
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,340
(The fierce udon game is on.)

1099
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:04,440
(Chewy noodles in warm soup)

1100
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:09,410
(Who will get to taste it?)

1101
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,640
Yes!

1102
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,340
(The other 5 are chosen.)

1103
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,980
(What a twist of fate!)

1104
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,880
(I'm going to cry.)

1105
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,780
All right. Give us udon.

1106
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,550
4 fish cake udon and 1 udon with rice.

1107
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,640
(We respect Kwang Soo's opinion.)

1108
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,910
Kwang Soo, I knew it.

1109
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:25,910
(Teary-eyed)

1110
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,010
Let's change places.

1111
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,780
(He is hurt.)

1112
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,710
Kwang Soo, where are you going?

1113
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,940
(Are you upset?)

1114
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,080
I'm...

1115
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,550
- going home. - Home?

1116
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,280
Try some of ours.

1117
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,210
- I don't eat much these days. - We'll share it with you.

1118
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:42,310
I mean...

1119
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,410
We'll share it.

1120
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,940
- That's right. - We'll do that.

1121
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,380
- If all of us give you a little... - Right.

1122
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,510
Is that allowed?

1123
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,280
Kwang Soo, can you go outside for a moment?

1124
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,080
- Why? - I'll announce a rule.

1125
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,780
Is he not allowed to see us eat?

1126
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,410
Is there something?

1127
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,810
Are they having a meeting?

1128
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:06,880
- Did something go wrong? - There must be something.

1129
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,010
We're probably supposed to do something.

1130
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,210
No. I'll give you a rule.

1131
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:15,010
- I'll give you a rule. - What is it?

1132
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,680
Here's the mission at this restaurant.

1133
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:19,610
When the udon is served,

1134
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:23,180
you'll offer some to Kwang Soo. If he refuses...

1135
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,280
(They'll be given extra 30 minutes.)

1136
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,580
(And Kwang Soo will get a bowl of udon.)

1137
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,680
What should we do?

1138
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,010
I feel sorry for him.

1139
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,680
(Kwang Soo has no idea.)

1140
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,310
This restaurant is completely soundproof.

1141
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,510
I mean...

1142
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,510
This building is very well-built.

1143
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,210
I've never seen such a soundproof udon place.

1144
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:52,050
(Now that I think of it...)

1145
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,140
Why am I left out? This is my week.

1146
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,580
What's that?

1147
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,940
- It looks so tasty. - It's here.

1148
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,910
- Look at that. - I can smell the green onions.

1149
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,140
It looks so tasty.

1150
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,440
(It looks so appetizing.)

1151
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,710
It looks amazing.

1152
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,550
It costs only 4 dollars and 50 cents.

1153
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,050
(Even the price is perfect.)

1154
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,440
(Slurping)

1155
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:19,380
This udon tastes like the one I had in high school.

1156
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,980
(You've never tasted anything like this.)

1157
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,050
It tastes amazing, right?

1158
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,580
(Kwang Soo returns.)

1159
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,680
I love anchovy stock.

1160
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,640
Let me remind you. Kwang Soo can't have any of it.

1161
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,780
Why not?

1162
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:35,610
According to the roulette, you're not allowed to eat.

1163
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:36,880
That's the rule.

1164
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:38,880
(Slurping)

1165
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:44,310
(The sound is torturing Kwang Soo.)

1166
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:45,480
I'm going crazy.

1167
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,010
It tastes so good.

1168
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:50,210
- I want to give up everything. - It's been 10 years for Seok Jin.

1169
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,510
We used to have this after chatting until late at night.

1170
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:55,140
(It tastes just like 10 years ago.)

1171
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,340
- Kwang Soo, do you want a bite? - Have a bite.

1172
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,880
(This is the 1st time they've asked.)

1173
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,710
Have a bite.

1174
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,410
(He looks at the staff.)

1175
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:06,540
Try it.

1176
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,210
Do you want it or not?

1177
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,240
(It's a temptation.)

1178
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,910
(The noodles are irresistible.)

1179
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,880
This is perfect for when you're hungry.

1180
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,110
(Is that so?)

1181
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,040
- The fish cakes are delicious. - They're chewy, too.

1182
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:28,180
(The slurping sounds make Kwang Soo's mouth water.)

1183
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,540
It's especially delicious today.

1184
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,640
Do you want some or not?

1185
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,180
I'm glad I didn't eat the noodles.

1186
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,610
(What will Kwang Soo do?)

1187
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:39,710
(He successfully overcomes the 1st temptation.)

1188
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,980
(They're impressed by his determination.)

1189
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:48,440
(How about this, Kwang Soo?)

1190
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,580
- I'm glad I didn't eat the noodles. - Me, too.

1191
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,910
(Jjajangmyeon looks too good.)

1192
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:53,640
What's this?

1193
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,040
(Jae Seok acts cautiously.)

1194
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,310
- How about some jjajangmyeon? - Try some of this.

1195
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,210
Can I have some jjajangmyeon?

1196
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,640
Of course not.

1197
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,410
It's against the result of the roulette.

1198
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,840
Why should I listen to you?

1199
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:08,580
(Kwang Soo doesn't care about his future.)

1200
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:11,280
(Kwang Soo will give in soon.)

1201
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:14,880
(He stares at the udon.)

1202
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,480
Do you want some?

1203
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,040
(Haha offers some.)

1204
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,710
(This is the 2nd temptation.)

1205
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:20,980
- Can I eat it? - Why not?

1206
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,140
What's wrong with that?

1207
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,810
The fish cakes are delicious.

1208
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:27,040
They aren't high-quality,

1209
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,580
and it's made with a lot of flour.

1210
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,810
It's more delicious.

1211
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,280
Try some. Hurry up so I can eat.

1212
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:33,610
It's made with a lot of flour.

1213
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,540
(He slowly approaches.)

1214
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,210
(He takes the bait.)

1215
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,840
That's right.

1216
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,140
(He hesitates.)

1217
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,640
(He's indecisive.)

1218
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,140
(Jae Seok is surprised.)

1219
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,140
Have some, Kwang Soo.

1220
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,010
(It's okay, Kwang Soo.)

1221
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:57,640
- Here, have some. - I'll eat some.

1222
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,040
(He's close to taking a bite.)

1223
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:03,610
(Will Kwang Soo overcome the 2nd temptation?)

1224
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:11,380
(Will he lose after a bite, or will he resist and win?)

1225
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:14,140
(What will Kwang Soo choose?)

1226
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:15,510
(He stops suddenly.)

1227
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:16,510
Don't eat it.

1228
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,080
(He overcomes the 2nd temptation.)

1229
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,080
Don't eat it.

1230
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,780
(We're proud of you.)

1231
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,440
- It's good. - The fish cakes are delicious.

1232
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,680
I was surprised by the wasabi.

1233
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:28,210
Forget it.

1234
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:30,240
(He gives in.)

1235
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:31,410
(He can't resist any longer.)

1236
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:32,440
Forget it.

1237
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,110
(He can't resist any longer.)

1238
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:39,040
(Kwang Soo fails.)

1239
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,240
You shouldn't have eaten it.

1240
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,510
- Why did you eat it? - Why?

1241
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,780
(He lost the chance to win 30 minutes and a bowl of udon.)

1242
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:51,310
(Kwang Soo is taken away.)

1243
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:53,910
You shouldn't have eaten it.

1244
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:56,110
- Why did you eat it? - Why?

1245
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:57,140
Wait a minute.

1246
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,040
My goodness, Kwang Soo.

1247
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,540
(Kwang Soo is taken away for eating udon.)

1248
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,010
Let me go. Let go!

1249
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:07,180
(This is so unfair.)

1250
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,210
It's so delicious.

1251
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:10,480
It's very delicious.

1252
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:16,140
(He hasn't even swallowed the noodles.)

1253
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,180
If he didn't take the bite, he would've gotten the udon.

1254
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,310
I thought he would make it.

1255
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:25,580
I know.

1256
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,980
When Kwang Soo took a bite, dark shadows appeared.

1257
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,580
(He's angry and hungry.)

1258
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:37,410
(At times like this...)

1259
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,440
(He gets out of the car.)

1260
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:42,240
(He can't resist anymore.)

1261
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:45,580
(Kwang Soo escapes and goes back to the restaurant.)

1262
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,380
- Kwang Soo. - I want to eat.

1263
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,580
(He wants to eat it all.)

1264
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,080
- What's going on? - Eat this one.

1265
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:53,080
- Eat this one, Kwang Soo. - What?

1266
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,440
What's going on?

1267
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:55,880
What's going on?

1268
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:00,480
(That's all Kwang Soo gets.)

1269
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,640
What?

1270
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,780
(He flaps to get away.)

1271
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:06,180
(Let me go.)

1272
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,180
Let me go!

1273
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,440
Hey, let me go.

1274
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,640
(He's the Korean Jean Valjean.)

1275
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,510
Let me go now.

1276
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:15,280
Let go of me.

1277
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,440
(He has the right to eat.)

1278
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:19,540
(He feels ashamed for what he's done.)

1279
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,540
One bite of it can make you crazy.

1280
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:25,510
- I completely understand. - It's delicious.

1281
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:27,280
It's really delicious.

1282
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,980
It was really good.

1283
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,580
My goodness.

1284
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:35,640
(Udon on a rainy day is perfect.)

1285
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,280
Udon is perfect for this weather. I'm about to lose it.

1286
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:44,840
(What can he do to win a bowl of udon?)

1287
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,610
(At times like this,)

1288
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,040
(he needs his ultimate weapon.)

1289
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:58,140
Excuse me.

1290
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,680
(He attempts to bribe.)

1291
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,910
This is my favorite doll.

1292
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,610
It's my favorite.

1293
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,380
Please, I'll be right back.

1294
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:09,710
I'll be back soon.

1295
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:11,140
(Everyone deserves a nice doll.)

1296
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,580
It was difficult to win this.

1297
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,080
(Everyone deserves a nice doll.)

1298
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,080
Sorry?

1299
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,910
(Go back in.)

1300
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:17,940
What?

1301
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,380
Wait...

1302
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,140
(There's no negotiation.)

1303
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:26,540
(How dare he try to bribe them?)

1304
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,810
Wait, hear me out.

1305
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,840
Give me back my doll.

1306
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,280
Hello?

1307
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,210
(He worked hard to win the doll.)

1308
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,380
Hold on.

1309
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,040
How... How could you do this?

1310
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:44,280
I gave him my doll.

1311
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:47,510
He took my doll without letting me go.

1312
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:53,110
(That's what Kwang Soo deserves for trying to bribe.)

1313
00:49:55,940 --> 00:50:00,680
(Even the security men can't be trusted.)

1314
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:01,910
What can I do?

1315
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:05,810
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

1316
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:06,810
- Thank you. - It was amazing.

1317
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,980
(Everyone else is full and happy.)

1318
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,940
- Here comes Kwang Soo. - Come here, Kwang Soo.

1319
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:11,980
(Everyone else is full and happy.)

1320
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,710
If you didn't take the bite, you would've won a bowl of udon.

1321
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,840
Did you know about that?

1322
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,910
- Of course. - Everyone knew.

1323
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:21,210
You did that when you knew?

1324
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:23,710
- We tried to help you. - We were being intentional.

1325
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:27,210
You're going to hit me, right?

1326
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,910
You're such a know-it-all.

1327
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,780
You're such a know-it-all.

1328
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:34,180
You can see the future.

1329
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:37,440
We knew but pretended not to know.

1330
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,910
(We forgot it was your week.)

1331
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,510
- We knew about it. - We have one last course.

1332
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:42,910
- Yes. - We have one last course.

1333
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:44,280
- Let's discuss. - Tell me your thoughts.

1334
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,440
Iced coffee, sandwiches,

1335
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,540
- cake, and tiramisu sound good. - That's a good idea.

1336
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,440
All right. What else?

1337
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,810
- You couldn't eat udon. - Right.

1338
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:55,380
Let's go eat tteokbokki.

1339
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:59,340
Let's go get some tteokbokki and fish cakes.

1340
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,110
We ate, but you have not.

1341
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,780
- You should go and eat. - I feel his love.

1342
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,810
You deserve to eat, too.

1343
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:08,340
I'm too full, so I'm going home.

1344
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,140
(He doesn't care about Kwang Soo.)

1345
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,280
Do I have money for taxi?

1346
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,710
We can have ice cream after he eats tteokbokki.

1347
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,880
He wasted all his money on the claw crane.

1348
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:20,180
- How will you go home? - I don't have enough.

1349
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,380
How will you go home?

1350
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,580
- He can't go home. - Just get off at Sinsa Station.

1351
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,210
You need to wait at a PC room until the first train arrives.

1352
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:29,210
- I don't know what to do. - It's not enough for a PC room.

1353
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:30,610
Make your choice, Kwang Soo.

1354
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,310
- Can I do whatever I want? - Of course.

1355
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,640
(Will it be cake?)

1356
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:39,480
(Will it be spicy tteokbokki?)

1357
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:42,780
I choose tteokbokki.

1358
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:44,310
(He chooses Jong Kook's tteokbokki.)

1359
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,040
That's right. You should eat.

1360
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,580
- You must be hungry. - I shouldn't stay hungry.

1361
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,940
- Why should I? - Of course not.

1362
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,440
- Okay, let's go. - He wants to eat.

1363
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,180
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1364
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:54,310
- We can walk there. - Let's go.

1365
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:55,410
(They head to a tteokbokki restaurant.)

1366
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,910
(The last course is a snack bar.)

1367
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:02,810
I don't remember. I should ask.

1368
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,110
Thankfully, no one is here.

1369
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:06,710
- Is it closed? - I hope it's open.

1370
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,910
I think it's closed.

1371
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,780
- It says naengmyeon... - Tteokbokki is on the menu.

1372
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,980
- It's on the menu. - It is.

1373
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,310
Tteokbokki is on the menu.

1374
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,240
- This is great. - Is it open?

1375
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:20,180
- Excuse me. - They have everything here.

1376
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,580
- We're shooting a TV show. - We'll stay in one corner.

1377
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,880
Thank you.

1378
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,610
- Come in. They sell everything. - Thank you.

1379
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:29,510
- Everything's on the menu. - There's even sundae.

1380
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:31,710
- There's everything. - This is the original restaurant.

1381
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:32,880
Right.

1382
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,140
Let's order tteokbokki and sundae.

1383
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,710
- The roulette's here again. - I'm scared.

1384
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:39,140
Here's the mission.

1385
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:40,840
You'll turn the roulette again.

1386
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,380
- Come on. - Turn the roulette.

1387
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,840
- Please. - Let him eat.

1388
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,040
The roulette chooses who will eat.

1389
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,680
- You must eat this time. - For Kwang Soo,

1390
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:52,440
we increased the probability twofold.

1391
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:55,280
- Let him eat. - We definitely should.

1392
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,180
- You should eat. - You will eat.

1393
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,110
- You can do it. - You should eat.

1394
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:00,710
- Turn the roulette. - I don't believe this.

1395
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,510
- Go on. - Turn the roulette.

1396
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,510
- Turn it hard. - Do it in one go.

1397
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,010
He'll get to eat.

1398
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:08,540
He'll get to eat. He can't be that unlucky.

1399
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:10,580
- Go ahead. - Don't feel pressured.

1400
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,610
He'll get to eat. He can't be that unlucky.

1401
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:14,440
- He got it. - Okay!

1402
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,580
(Kwang Soo is picked.)

1403
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,040
- Okay! - That's great.

1404
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:20,110
It's a happy ending.

1405
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,310
It is.

1406
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:22,880
- This is what I wanted. - Thank you.

1407
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,440
Enjoy your food.

1408
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:27,340
- Kwang Soo, you can start eating. - It's a lot of food.

1409
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:30,510
- Try it. It's delicious. - This restaurant is the original.

1410
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,180
The mandu...

1411
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,910
- is very good here. - Try it.

1412
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,440
They are delicious.

1413
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,010
They're very delicious.

1414
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:39,440
Here comes the tteokbokki.

1415
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:41,180
(Here's the best snack food.)

1416
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:42,280
Here you go.

1417
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,680
- Dip sundae in it. - It's gukmul tteokbokki.

1418
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:48,180
- Gosh. - I can finish the whole bowl.

1419
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,040
- Of course. - That's easy.

1420
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,180
I'm sure he can eat them all.

1421
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,080
- Kwang Soo. - I'm full,

1422
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,810
- but it still looks good. - I want a bite.

1423
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:59,280
- Don't you want a bite or two? - I want to try the mandu.

1424
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:00,540
This is amazing.

1425
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,380
- Dip this in the tteokbokki sauce. - Are they wheat cakes?

1426
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:06,280
I was thinking about the same thing.

1427
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,810
I was thinking about dipping mandu in the sauce.

1428
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:10,580
- Try it. - These days,

1429
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,680
there are many one-man shows.

1430
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:14,610
This is what it reminds me of.

1431
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,340
That's what I wanted them to try.

1432
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:20,710
Dip the sundae in the sauce.

1433
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:21,980
Dip the sundae in the sauce...

1434
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,940
- but put it on your spoon. - That sounds good.

1435
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:26,480
That's right.

1436
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,710
- No, pick up the sundae first. - Put it on your spoon first.

1437
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,140
- Sundae first. - Put it on your spoon first...

1438
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:34,340
and then dip it.

1439
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,280
If you look here, there's carrot filling.

1440
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,640
That's unnecessary information. Don't talk about that.

1441
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,280
People don't like it when you talk too much.

1442
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,880
- That's it. - Submerge it. Oh my.

1443
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,480
That looks so good.

1444
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,880
It must be good.

1445
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:48,380
Let me try some.

1446
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:51,080
- People don't say that these days. - Do they not?

1447
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,580
- They don't. - Just smell it.

1448
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,410
Talk about how it tastes.

1449
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:56,310
(- Ji Hyo looks beautiful. - She looks hungry as well.)

1450
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,940
- It must be good. - Is it good?

1451
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:00,280
- It's good, right? - Try more sauce.

1452
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,980
- Right away. - One more time.

1453
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,680
Slurp it.

1454
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,840
(- That sounds amazing. - The sauce is a must.)

1455
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,880
Listen to that sound.

1456
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,480
- How was it? - It has to be good.

1457
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,180
- It's insane. - Really?

1458
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,110
- It must be really good. - I can't stop eating.

1459
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:15,340
Is it that good?

1460
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:18,110
- I want some. - Udon was good, but this is great.

1461
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:19,840
(1 hour and 59 minutes remain.)

1462
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,840
- Are you enjoying your meal? - Yes.

1463
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,780
Can Kwang Soo stay and the rest of you come out?

1464
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,440
Don't make me lonely.

1465
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,440
- Are you assigning them missions? - Yes, I am.

1466
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,380
(The 5 members go outside to hear their missions.)

1467
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,410
- Is it good? - I wonder what it is.

1468
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,710
Everything's so good today.

1469
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:37,210
- Here's the rule. - What is it?

1470
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:39,480
Kwang Soo is eating inside, right?

1471
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:41,980
- You have an option. - What is it?

1472
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,580
You can all leave now...

1473
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:46,580
and finish early.

1474
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,510
Or you can wait for Kwang Soo to finish eating...

1475
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,580
and complete another mission before going home.

1476
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,780
That's harsh.

1477
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:57,210
If we wait for him, we have to complete another mission?

1478
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:59,710
- What time is it? - We don't know when it'll finish.

1479
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:01,380
If we leave now...

1480
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,480
Are you sure this is Kwang Soo's Week?

1481
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,480
What are we supposed to do?

1482
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,480
(That sounds really tempting.)

1483
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:12,540
(Will they stay together or leave Kwang Soo alone?)

1484
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,140
It's 4am right now.

1485
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:16,910
I'm sleepy.

1486
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:19,840
- There's no traffic right now. - You're right. We can leave.

1487
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,710
- Look at his eyes. - It'll only take 30 minutes.

1488
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:23,780
(Jong Kook is trying to avoid rush hour.)

1489
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,880
Look at his face.

1490
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,980
- He made up his mind. - Come on.

1491
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:30,680
- We'll see him again next week. - You made up your mind.

1492
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,810
(He's anxious for some reason.)

1493
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,010
I think we should go home because of Jong Kook.

1494
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:36,580
That's important. We are one.

1495
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:37,980
He lives far.

1496
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:40,410
- I live far. - He lives in Anyang.

1497
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:42,640
- You're falling asleep, too. - I am.

1498
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,780
- But she lives close-by. - And Kwang Soo...

1499
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,380
must be getting full now, so we should decide quickly.

1500
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,940
- I agree. - Sure.

1501
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,410
What do you think?

1502
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,040
Everybody agrees.

1503
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,340
(Do I have to say it?)

1504
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:59,010
(They all agree.)

1505
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:00,840
- That was funny. - All right.

1506
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,940
- I agree. - Your face was funny.

1507
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:05,180
You can look through the window...

1508
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,840
- and say bye. - I feel bad for him.

1509
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,380
This is what we should do.

1510
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:11,440
Haha, can you move a few steps forward?

1511
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,710
(They're not plotting anything, right?)

1512
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:16,180
Crawl. Go lower.

1513
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,180
(Let's go home now.)

1514
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,180
(They run away before Kwang Soo notices.)

1515
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,340
Go.

1516
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,680
(They run away before Kwang Soo notices.)

1517
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,210
Kwang Soo is still eating.

1518
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:26,010
(Enjoy the night eating alone, Kwang Soo.)

1519
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:28,810
- That's not the right car. - It's at the front.

1520
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:30,180
(He glances around.)

1521
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,210
Can you get Jae Seok's autograph?

1522
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:34,710
(They're running away outside.)

1523
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:37,010
- What about me? - I'm not sure.

1524
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:38,280
(You should care about me, too.)

1525
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,710
Your granddaughter might like me, too.

1526
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:43,210
I'm not sure. I don't know your name.

1527
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:45,110
I'm on this show as well.

1528
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:47,040
(I should work harder.)

1529
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:51,640
(The other members are running away while Kwang Soo is distracted.)

1530
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,840
(They must leave quickly.)

1531
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,940
What if he tries to get revenge?

1532
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:00,710
Here it is.

1533
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:01,710
(They steal the one and only car.)

1534
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:03,080
Let's go.

1535
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:07,080
(If they return before the end of the race, they get to go home.)

1536
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,210
Your Member's Week is supposed to be bad for you.

1537
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:11,210
(He is this week's victim.)

1538
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,980
Are you holding me hostage?

1539
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:17,280
- I feel sorry for Kwang Soo. - Same here.

1540
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,010
This is actually for him.

1541
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,710
It's his week.

1542
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:22,440
(The 5 escapees head back.)

1543
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:25,940
I feel sorry for him.

1544
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,680
(He starts getting lonely.)

1545
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,680
Why aren't they coming back?

1546
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:33,480
(He finishes his food while the others run away.)

1547
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,580
Did I clear the mission? I'm done.

1548
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:36,910
- Did you finish? - Yes.

1549
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:40,010
The others have left for the final place already.

1550
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,580
(This is supposed to be my week.)

1551
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,210
Isn't this my week?

1552
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:47,340
They left me here?

1553
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:49,880
This is how your week is supposed to be.

1554
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,310
(The host always goes through some hardship.)

1555
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:54,540
- I was a victim once, too. - Me, too.

1556
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:56,280
You know what happened to me, right?

1557
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,110
(He gets furious.)

1558
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,680
They took the car,

1559
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,180
so you can take a taxi.

1560
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:07,710
(Am I supposed to take a taxi alone at this hour?)

1561
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,910
(1 hour and 47 minutes remain.)

1562
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:12,480
We'll make it on time.

1563
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,010
You would've been on the Gangbyeon Expressway.

1564
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:16,640
(If they're caught, they can't leave early.)

1565
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,210
- Turn back and go straight. - Should he take a U-turn?

1566
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:21,710
They were saying how it's Monday, and the traffic will be crazy.

1567
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:23,280
Is that why they left?

1568
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,340
My gosh.

1569
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:29,180
(Did they leave me because of the traffic?)

1570
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,410
This isn't nice.

1571
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:35,440
(I can't let you go home early.)

1572
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:40,280
I'm in a hurry, so can you please go a little bit faster?

1573
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,980
(Will the others manage to go home early?)

1574
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,380
What if we get punished for betraying him?

1575
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:49,080
I thought about it.

1576
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:52,180
What if this is a test?

1577
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:54,710
- That's what I'm saying. - What if it backfires?

1578
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:56,840
(They start getting suspicious.)

1579
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:58,910
I think that might be it.

1580
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,080
- I doubt it. - I was wondering about it.

1581
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,440
(Is this a part of Kwang Soo's plan?)

1582
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:06,580
(During the pre-meeting)

1583
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:09,710
(He wanted to test the members' loyalty.)

1584
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:12,910
What if this is a test?

1585
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:15,210
(Is this Kwang Soo's plan?)

1586
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:17,540
(They get back with 1 hour and 45 minutes left.)

1587
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:19,940
- The lights are on. - We have to go the other way.

1588
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:22,780
- Let's finish it up and go. - The lights are on.

1589
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:23,980
Really?

1590
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:25,810
Is there a penalty?

1591
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:27,440
- I doubt it. - I don't think there is.

1592
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,610
Just in case.

1593
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,480
- This might be a trap. - Let's not think that way.

1594
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,710
- Kwang Soo's plan? - His scheme?

1595
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:35,240
Is this part of his plan to test our friendship?

1596
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:38,540
He probably thought we'd betray him.

1597
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:39,980
Let's not think negatively.

1598
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,380
(A mysterious truck appears in front of them.)

1599
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:45,880
What's this? What's that?

1600
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:48,440
- What's that? - Why is there a sprinkler truck?

1601
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:49,710
(This doesn't look good.)

1602
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:51,540
What's that? It's from Running Man.

1603
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:53,580
- It's a sprinkler truck. - Let's get off first.

1604
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,710
(Will they go home early or fall into Kwang Soo's trap?)

1605
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:58,340
- Hold on. - We can't take it back.

1606
01:00:58,340 --> 01:00:59,910
- What is it? - Let's get out.

1607
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:02,710
(Thank to their betraying Kwang Soo, they return on time.)

1608
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:04,110
There's a polling station.

1609
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:06,080
I didn't feel so good about this.

1610
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,640
(There's a polling station.)

1611
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,440
(You thought it was over, right?)

1612
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:12,780
We didn't have to do this,

1613
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:14,910
but it's for the excitement of the show.

1614
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:17,340
We did it for the show.

1615
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,440
- That's right. - Please take it that way.

1616
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:22,880
Here's the final mission for Night Tour Course.

1617
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,440
(Final mission?)

1618
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,240
We started Member's Week with an ice shower,

1619
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,840
so we'll end with...

1620
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:34,180
an ice shower for a fresh start.

1621
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,540
There's only one member...

1622
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,010
who will get the shower.

1623
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:42,480
(Only one of them will be penalized.)

1624
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,140
Through a voting process, the person who gets the most votes...

1625
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:48,280
will take the shower today.

1626
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,840
Each member gets to vote once.

1627
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,710
If your course was chosen today,

1628
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,040
you receive an extra vote.

1629
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:56,480
We'll start...

1630
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:58,380
voting now.

1631
01:01:58,380 --> 01:01:59,610
How could you...

1632
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:02,080
It's so cold today.

1633
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,440
Please hand out the ballots.

1634
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,480
(They must choose a person to punish.)

1635
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,380
How are we supposed to do this?

1636
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,780
Look at his face.

1637
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,210
Is this why we came back early?

1638
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,780
Where's Kwang Soo?

1639
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:16,340
I'm in a hurry, so can you please go a little bit faster?

1640
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:17,580
7012?

1641
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:18,980
(7012, my foot.)

1642
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,910
(Enraged, he almost arrives.)

1643
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:23,180
- This makes us uncomfortable. - Why would you do this?

1644
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:24,710
Why would we do this?

1645
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:26,540
You said it'd be over once we get here.

1646
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:27,710
(Who will they vote?)

1647
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:30,980
- Please vote. - You know whom this is for.

1648
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,180
(Kwang Soo is the host.)

1649
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:35,110
You're so cruel.

1650
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:36,580
You know whose week this is.

1651
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:38,540
(They're in this together.)

1652
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,780
Which one of us didn't get the ice shower?

1653
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:42,340
- Did you get it? - I did.

1654
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:44,710
- Did you? - It started off with me.

1655
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:46,180
- You didn't get it. - Did you?

1656
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:47,710
You didn't get it either.

1657
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:49,440
- I did. - When did you?

1658
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,540
- It wasn't aired. - What are you talking about?

1659
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:54,710
- Haha and I dived into ice water. - We all did it.

1660
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:57,040
It almost killed me.

1661
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,580
- We all did it except Kwang Soo. - It almost killed me.

1662
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,680
- He didn't do it. - He didn't?

1663
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:03,540
- That's right. - My gosh.

1664
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:05,980
We're not trying to make things up. It's just strange.

1665
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:07,840
(They all settle on Kwang Soo.)

1666
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:10,110
Let's get this over with, everybody.

1667
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:12,710
Sure.

1668
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:14,380
- I don't even know. - We can't do anything else.

1669
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:16,080
(They try to finish before they feel more guilty.)

1670
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,580
- There's a reason. - We can't do much else.

1671
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:19,880
Let's just do it.

1672
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,710
(It's supposed to be Kwang Soo's Week anyways.)

1673
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,840
Thank you.

1674
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,280
(He arrives late.)

1675
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,840
(Stop it, you punks.)

1676
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:31,240
Kwang Soo is here.

1677
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,680
He's here.

1678
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:34,110
(He's in tatters.)

1679
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:35,180
Hey.

1680
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:37,380
- You can't do this to me. - Kwang Soo.

1681
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:39,080
(We're just helping you stand out.)

1682
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,340
- Come here. - I'm sorry.

1683
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:41,580
Isn't this too harsh?

1684
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,440
- You're mistaken. - We did it for you.

1685
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,010
(Here comes our main host.)

1686
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:47,210
You have to understand. We were trying to make it funny.

1687
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:49,540
We couldn't do anything else. Look at the big picture.

1688
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:51,380
- You would have done the same. - Look at the big picture.

1689
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:52,980
- Are you serious? - Tell me this.

1690
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:54,880
If you were in our shoes, wouldn't you've done the same?

1691
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,010
(Be honest with us.)

1692
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:58,180
- I would have left too, but... - Exactly.

1693
01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:00,840
Kwang Soo, here's the rule for the final mission.

1694
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:03,580
You get to vote...

1695
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:05,180
who gets the ice shower.

1696
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:07,080
(That person will play the tragic, lead character.)

1697
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,040
That person will get the ice shower.

1698
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:11,840
(He panics.)

1699
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,210
Why are you avoiding me?

1700
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:14,880
Why aren't you looking at me?

1701
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,480
All right. They have already voted.

1702
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:19,010
You are the last one to vote.

1703
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:21,410
They finished voting?

1704
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:22,480
Behind you...

1705
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:24,680
- They are done voting? - Yes, they are.

1706
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,340
- Hey. - This is my week though.

1707
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:28,710
- I guess this is the fate of hosts. - Hurry up.

1708
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:29,940
- I mean... - Vote first.

1709
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:31,480
- You should vote. - Go and vote.

1710
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,080
- We all have the right to vote. - It's all the same.

1711
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,940
- The conditions are all the same. - Go and exercise your right.

1712
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:38,410
This is a strange omen.

1713
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:39,980
I'm sorry, but can I go first?

1714
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:42,780
(The king of variety shows is too cruel.)

1715
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:44,310
- I feel really bad. - We mustn't watch it happen.

1716
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:45,710
- I feel so bad. - I feel so horrible.

1717
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:48,540
- There's no need for us to watch. - I can't look at him.

1718
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:50,510
- Isn't it better if we just go? - I can't face him.

1719
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:52,080
If he faces the punishment by himself...

1720
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,210
- He has to face it alone. - We feel really bad.

1721
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:56,410
- We feel sorry. - Aren't you being too harsh?

1722
01:04:56,410 --> 01:04:58,340
- It's because we are sorry. - Let's announce.

1723
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:01,110
You can announce the result from far away.

1724
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:03,310
- Why would you do it here? - Just let us know the result.

1725
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:06,340
- Post it on the social media. - Call us to inform the result.

1726
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,940
- We can all be in the car. - How about this?

1727
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:11,710
We can get on our own car and head out.

1728
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:15,480
- Whoever it is can come back. - That's right.

1729
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,580
- We will begin counting the votes. - Don't call it out one by one.

1730
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:19,980
- We will start. - Hey, by the way...

1731
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:22,810
- We can see it from here. - "Lee Kwang Soo".

1732
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:24,240
Kwang Soo gets one vote.

1733
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,640
You won't tell me who voted for me?

1734
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,240
Kwang Soo has two votes so far.

1735
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:28,440
(He's in a daze.)

1736
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,280
Kwang Soo has three votes so far.

1737
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:32,410
Three votes? Did you say three?

1738
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:34,340
This is the fourth vote for Kwang Soo.

1739
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:36,510
(Kwang Soo is bound to be the star.)

1740
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:39,910
"Lee Kwang Soo". "Lee Kwang Soo".

1741
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,380
Are you serious?

1742
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,710
- Everyone voted for me? - It was an unanimous decision.

1743
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:45,040
Every single one voted for me?

1744
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:49,280
The ballot has been closed.

1745
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:51,440
I'm not lying. I have goosebumps.

1746
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,080
(Their friendship gives him goosebumps.)

1747
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,410
- I'm serious. - By the way...

1748
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:56,910
- We have our reasons. - I really did get the goosebumps.

1749
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:59,510
- Look. I have them right here. - You haven't had that shower.

1750
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:02,010
- You are the last one. - You're the only one left.

1751
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:06,580
Excluding Kwang Soo, everyone voted for Kwang Soo.

1752
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:09,110
Does he really have face that shower?

1753
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:10,180
Kwang Soo...

1754
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:12,240
accomplished his hidden mission.

1755
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:19,710
(He accomplished a hidden mission?)

1756
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:20,940
- What's happening? - I knew it.

1757
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:22,680
Was there another mission?

1758
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:25,180
(Laughing)

1759
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:26,880
This Member's Week is so much fun.

1760
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,240
Hidden mission?

1761
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:31,540
(1 hour before the shoot)

1762
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:37,010
(He had a secret rendezvous with a producer.)

1763
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:40,280
(Kwang Soo is always suspected.)

1764
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:44,280
(This is why the staff prepared a revenge race after 7 years.)

1765
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:47,080
(A hidden rule was a bonus.)

1766
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,840
(I do like hidden rules.)

1767
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,010
A hidden rule?

1768
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:52,510
If you are voted...

1769
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:55,980
to receive the punishment...

1770
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:57,880
I am 99 percent positive it will be me.

1771
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:02,410
The members who voted for you will receive the punishment.

1772
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:03,940
(It's a boomerang effect.)

1773
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:06,380
- Only the members who voted for me? - That's correct.

1774
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:08,680
What if all five of them vote for me?

1775
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:10,940
All five of them will face the ice shower.

1776
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:13,710
(Everyone will have the ice shower?)

1777
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:14,880
What if I am not chosen?

1778
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:16,610
If that happens,

1779
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:21,480
you will face the shower by yourself since you doubted their loyalty.

1780
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:24,010
It doesn't sound right, but this is a fact.

1781
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,610
There hasn't been a single incident that they didn't betray me.

1782
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:33,210
I am not sure if I should be happy or sad. I don't know.

1783
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:35,880
I wasn't going to write his name.

1784
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,780
- What's going to happen? - However,

1785
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,780
- there is alway a hope. - You're right.

1786
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,580
Since Kwang Soo is generous...

1787
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,210
No, I am not.

1788
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:45,340
(I don't know what generosity is.)

1789
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:46,410
What should I be?

1790
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:48,780
- Let me try it again. - Everyone here voted for me.

1791
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,880
- They were ready to leave me. - Kwang Soo.

1792
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,710
You will...

1793
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:56,410
pick only one member to face the punishment with your own hands.

1794
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:57,910
- That's too mean. - I have to?

1795
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:00,440
We thought it might be too hard for you to choose one.

1796
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:02,310
We have prepared a dart board.

1797
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:04,180
- We will write the names and spin. - This is unbelievable.

1798
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:06,880
The board is split into 12 parts.

1799
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:10,810
Kwang Soo can write names however he wants.

1800
01:08:11,410 --> 01:08:13,640
Since I feel bad, I will write my own name in one blank spot.

1801
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:15,380
- Are you serious? - Really?

1802
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:17,510
- Hey. - I will write it once. Can I?

1803
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,680
- You can. - In one blank spot?

1804
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:19,980
- Even if you might get it? - Really?

1805
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:20,980
- I can do that? - Yes, you can.

1806
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:23,880
How can you agree so easily in times like this? Are you certain?

1807
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,180
Since you are the host, you can do whatever you want.

1808
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:29,080
- You can write anyone. - Write the staff members' names.

1809
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:31,980
- Both of our names will be on it. - He had udon by himself before.

1810
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:34,680
- I am fine with that. - That's right. Write his name too.

1811
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:37,480
Why don't you write everyone's name at least once? It's confusing.

1812
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,240
First, let's write everyone's name at least once.

1813
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,440
Hold on.

1814
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:43,240
- You put my names in one area. - That's true.

1815
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:44,280
(That part has become my area.)

1816
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:45,540
Your handwriting is so neat.

1817
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:48,410
- You write so well. - How about writing Seok Jin again?

1818
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:50,040
You wrote Haha's name only once.

1819
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:51,780
- That's right. - Haha.

1820
01:08:51,780 --> 01:08:53,540
You were a bit annoying today.

1821
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:56,410
- He lives so close from here. - Before...

1822
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:58,580
Who fed you the noodles?

1823
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:00,110
(Right. It was you.)

1824
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:02,480
- I ate the noodles on my own. - It was him.

1825
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,240
- You can write his name once more. - I did it for the mission.

1826
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,710
- Why don't you write down his name? - You should write it again.

1827
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:08,480
- It was to complete the mission. - Write his name again.

1828
01:09:08,610 --> 01:09:10,440
I only ate so that we could complete the mission.

1829
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:13,080
(He smacks the back of Kwang Soo's head.)

1830
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,140
Help him erase the names.

1831
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:16,440
- Give me a new one. - All right. I am sorry.

1832
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:17,850
I got it. I'm sorry.

1833
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:20,680
- You should write his name. - I think you should.

1834
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,640
- There's no need to think about. - Great.

1835
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:24,350
- Are you done writing? - Yes, I am.

1836
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:26,280
- I have one more than others. - You have the most.

1837
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,640
- Ji Hyo has one less than us. - Right.

1838
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,240
- Haha does have one more. - Right.

1839
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:31,140
- Ready. - You only get to spin it once.

1840
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:32,940
- He gets to spin it once. - Yes, only once.

1841
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:34,280
- You can't complain afterwards. - Okay.

1842
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,580
- Please. - Goodness.

1843
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:38,350
- My names are clustered together. - Why is my name on three spaces?

1844
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:42,380
(Only one member will face the ice shower.)

1845
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:44,850
(The roulette is spinning.)

1846
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:47,680
(As long as it's not me, it's fine.)

1847
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:50,710
(Please don't let it be my name.)

1848
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:54,440
(The roulette slows down between Jae Seok and Jong Kook's names.)

1849
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,410
- My name is written twice. - So is mine.

1850
01:09:56,410 --> 01:09:57,580
It's the same with my name.

1851
01:09:57,580 --> 01:10:00,910
(Who will be the one to face the ice shower?)

1852
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:04,640
(If it continues, it might be either Jae Seok or Jong Kook.)

1853
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,280
(Moving back and forth)

1854
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:10,510
(Yu Jae Seok is chosen.)

1855
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:14,110
(It's Jae Seok.)

1856
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:16,280
(Sighing)

1857
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:22,940
(Yes! We can go home dry.)

1858
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:24,810
I thought it would be me. I really thought so.

1859
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:27,410
- I thought I was going to get it. - It's Jae Seok.

1860
01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:29,010
(They are so annoying.)

1861
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:30,910
(For what did I rush today?)

1862
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:33,440
- He got it. - Look at him.

1863
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:37,210
(I don't have a change of clothes or my manager with me.)

1864
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:39,140
- I thought I was going to die. - How can this be?

1865
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:41,540
- This is unbelievable. - How can this happen?

1866
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:42,710
Let's get going.

1867
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:47,380
(A splendid finale of Member's Week is Jae Seok's ice shower.)

1868
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:49,110
Hurry.

1869
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:51,710
Goodness. I love you, Jae Seok.

1870
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,880
- Jae Seok, I love you. - Okay.

1871
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:56,380
Somehow, he always gets this sort of punishment.

1872
01:10:57,180 --> 01:10:59,980
Anyway, this is the last week of Member's Week.

1873
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:01,110
Let's work harder starting next week.

1874
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:02,240
- Let's work harder. - Let's do that.

1875
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:05,080
- I can't watch this. - I'm sorry, Jae Seok.

1876
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:06,580
We love you.

1877
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:08,780
(The ice shower will be colder than the coldness at dawn.)

1878
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:10,850
(I think I might freeze from watching him.)

1879
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:16,280
(Splashing)

1880
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,010
- Jae Seok. - I'm freezing.

1881
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:21,810
- Goodness. Are you okay? - You'll be okay.

1882
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:23,480
This isn't as bad as I thought.

1883
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,540
I thought it would be worse.

1884
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:26,680
I'm fine, Kwang Soo.

1885
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,850
(Member's Week is a complete success.)

1886
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:31,780
- Great work, Kwang Soo. - You too. Jae Seok.

1887
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:36,140
We are indeed unlucky.

1888
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:38,940
- Go home. - Good job, Jae Seok.

1889
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:40,310
I'm sorry. I love you.

1890
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:42,310
I love you.

1891
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,110
(He's gone, right?)

1892
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:51,380
(Jae Seok deserves it. It serves him right.)

1893
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:53,910
(They are acting silly.)

1894
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,810
I really thought it was my name.

1895
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:01,980
(They can't hold in the excitement.)

1896
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:04,040
(Member's Week reaches an end.)

1897
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,510
We haven't seen that for a while.

1898
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:10,080
(We will start afresh with warm breeze of spring.)

1899
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:14,080
(This is the most dangerous deal in Running Man's history.)

1900
01:12:14,110 --> 01:12:15,980
(Resting Place)

1901
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,980
If Running Man members win the battle against the staff,

1902
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:20,980
we will provide you a resting place.

1903
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:23,680
However, if the staff wins,

1904
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:26,110
one of the members have to provide their house as the resting place.

1905
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:28,210
- No way. - This won't happen.

1906
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:29,710
We have to win no matter what.

1907
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:32,540
