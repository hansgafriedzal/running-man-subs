1
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:08,008
(The most dangerous deal in the history of Running Man)

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,143
(Resting Place)

3
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,979
If members win in the competition against the staff,

4
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:14,814
they will be provided the resting place.

5
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,551
However, if the members lose,

6
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:20,153
one of them has to let their house to be the resting place.

7
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:23,590
(The last struggle to protect their private area)

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,992
(Will they gain something or lose something?)

9
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:28,962
(How would this dangerous deal end?)

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,398
(A spring day in March in Seoul)

11
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:34,935
Thank you for your hard work...

12
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:36,303
during the Member's Week.

13
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:39,639
We will start again with a new race.

14
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,409
Today, there is a new staff member...

15
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,545
- who is also off to a new start. - Really?

16
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,947
(Staff off to a new start?)

17
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,583
It's our youngest staff member, Se Mi.

18
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:50,717
Se Mi.

19
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,018
(Se Mi is...)

20
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:56,122
(the energizer and the scene stealer of Running Man.)

21
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:58,158
(She successfully bid Kwang Soo with 10 dollars.)

22
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:01,561
(She entertained us with her humor and wit.)

23
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,831
(She is the official vitamin of Running Man.)

24
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,367
She is supposed to be having the last shoot...

25
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,003
- with us today. - Really?

26
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,304
- That's why Se Mi is... - I see.

27
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:14,774
As it happens, she's moving to another place today,

28
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:19,279
and we will be helping her to move and make a fresh start.

29
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,547
- Move? - To where?

30
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,449
- Why should we help? - She could do it by herself.

31
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,951
- What do you mean? - We have...

32
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,254
helped celebrities move houses before.

33
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,089
But for the staff?

34
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,858
- It's nice to help out, but... - To what extent should we help you?

35
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:34,861
I really moved yesterday.

36
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:35,895
My real house.

37
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,731
- Oh, yes. I heard he did. - He moved again.

38
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,599
- It's my ninth move after marriage. - He went to Sinsa-dong.

39
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,103
- So Hyun Woo moved once every year? - He did.

40
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,372
He has five kids of school uniform.

41
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,073
(We will count on Seok Jin, the expert on moving.)

42
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:50,810
You'll be competing with the staff as you help out her moving.

43
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,212
What kind of race?

44
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:56,716
If you win, we will provide Se Mi's previous house...

45
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,885
as your new resting place.

46
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:02,756
(Resting place for Running Man?)

47
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,892
Are you asking the married men to have two houses at once?

48
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:09,262
Why does it have to be here? I live in Anyang.

49
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:12,399
I don't even come here.

50
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:15,902
You live in Anyang, but you work in Gangnam.

51
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:19,205
I live in Anyang and work in Gangnam, but why here in Mapo?

52
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:20,840
For these two, it's a nice spot.

53
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,709
- It would be nice for them. - We live in Mapo.

54
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,813
If these two use the resting place, there will be strange rumors.

55
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,782
It will definitely seem strange.

56
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,317
- Right? - We used to be in a love triangle.

57
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,185
- It might seem strange. - It will.

58
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,321
Nowadays, rumors...

59
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,523
- can be a big deal. - It will be endless.

60
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,492
However, if you lose...

61
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,661
and the staff members win,

62
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:45,365
one of you has to let your house be the resting place.

63
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,467
- We have one here. - His house will do.

64
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,635
Why are you pointing at me?

65
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,403
- It can't be mine. - I live with my parents.

66
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,572
- Me too. - I have my second baby coming.

67
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:56,876
- My mother in law... - It's the staff against Kwang Soo.

68
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,479
- It's his race again. - When will this stop?

69
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,014
It's Kwang Soo's week again.

70
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,852
(They visit his house out of the blue.)

71
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,756
(Whenever they visit, they devastate his house.)

72
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:13,460
(I want this nightmare to end this time.)

73
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,861
- Poor Kwang Soo. - You can't.

74
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,763
I'm actually living with a woman.

75
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:17,864
I don't live alone anymore.

76
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,599
You can no longer come to my house.

77
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,036
- Don't come to my house. - I know this. We can't go there.

78
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,071
I'm going to kick the camera. Don't you dare come to my place.

79
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,874
- Don't even come near my house. - You can't do this to him anymore.

80
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,876
- He's living with a woman? - Stop it already.

81
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,112
- Right now... - I just moved into that house.

82
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,348
That means we have to win by all means.

83
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,416
- Let's win. - We ought to win.

84
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,151
- It's for Kwang Soo's sake. - We must protect Kwang Soo's place.

85
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,853
We should respect Kwang Soo's privacy.

86
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,556
The house you see behind you is Se Mi's house.

87
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,492
- I see. - We'll head there to help her move.

88
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,994
- Isn't it nice to have a home here? - We have to go around then.

89
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:51,865
Nowadays, it's quite romantic to live in a neighborhood like this.

90
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,734
- A house on the rooftop? - A rooftop house.

91
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,703
- We're on our way. - That must be it.

92
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,838
- I guess this is it. - It's that yellow building.

93
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:01,608
- It's right here. - It's here. I see her moving stuff.

94
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,576
- Se Mi. - Se Mi. This is where you lived.

95
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,078
This was your house.

96
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,713
Where are you moving to?

97
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,481
I'm moving to a house within the neighborhood.

98
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,183
- You are? - You are wearing a microphone.

99
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,885
- Se Mi. - Look at you, Se Mi.

100
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,586
- Hey. - You put on a microphone.

101
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,655
- You even wore makeup. - Goodness, Se Mi.

102
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,056
You've fully prepared to be on TV.

103
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,391
- Let's go. - You even washed your hair.

104
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:19,592
You usually wear hats.

105
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,562
I've been on TV for a long time, but I've never...

106
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,331
- been to a writer's house. - It's my first time too.

107
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,333
- Exactly. - Do we have to go this far?

108
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,537
What's more is that I've never helped a writer with her move.

109
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,405
We might see some things you might be embarrassed about.

110
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,240
All right. Let's get moving first. Se Mi.

111
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,942
- Do you live alone? - It's a lady's house.

112
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,210
- It's a bit awkward. - You should've moved on your own.

113
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,212
- It's a bit embarrassing. - The house seems too good to leave.

114
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,780
- Yes, it is too good to leave. - She's even wearing socks.

115
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,881
(What will the race be?)

116
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,349
Did you say she's wearing socks?

117
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,584
Do we go up one more floor?

118
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:45,852
- Yes, we do. - It must be the rooftop house.

119
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,087
- It's a house you see on dramas. - It does look like one on TV.

120
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,722
- It's a rooftop house! - It's quite charming.

121
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:50,757
Really?

122
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,091
- Se Mi, is it the rooftop house? - Yes, it is.

123
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,793
- This is nice. - It's charming.

124
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,396
The view here is awesome too.

125
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,164
- It's amazing here. - Here it is.

126
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,799
- You really lived here? - It's a scene from a drama.

127
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,201
(Sky is the ceiling of this romantic rooftop house.)

128
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,102
You can even raise something on the roof.

129
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,437
That will make a nice slide.

130
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,805
There's even a garden.

131
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,707
This is romantic.

132
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,443
- Rooftop houses can be... - We have fantasies about it.

133
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,011
- I agree. - It's really nice.

134
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,214
- Everyone wants to live here once. - This is...

135
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,049
- I want to live here with friends. - So do I.

136
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,651
- We can have a barbecue party. - Right.

137
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,821
- You can even raise a dog. - You can raise a big dog.

138
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,890
- Shall we go in now? - It's this way.

139
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,659
- I've been to a coworker's house. - Right.

140
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,461
- I haven't been to a writer's home. - This is the first time.

141
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,562
Somehow, I feel shy about this.

142
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,231
- Se Mi, you have a clean house. - This is nice.

143
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,732
- Can we go in? - Can we?

144
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,267
This is a cool place.

145
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,804
- You can use this for a drama set. - It's charming.

146
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,873
- It's romantic. - I haven't seen that kind of TV.

147
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,476
- The name tag I signed is there. - Where?

148
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:44,744
- Where? - Gosh.

149
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,113
- They are Jae Seok and Kwang Soo's. - There they are.

150
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,049
- She doesn't have ours. - She doesn't have the rest.

151
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,351
Se Mi.

152
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,520
- Isn't this really an old TV? - It is.

153
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,488
- I bought this when I first... - I really like this place.

154
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,890
started living on my own. I still watch it.

155
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,057
- Do you really? - Yes, I do.

156
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,293
I haven't seen this kind of TV for so long.

157
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,862
- It works. - No way.

158
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,532
- Do you have a remote control? - Yes. It's right there.

159
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,467
- We can even replay this. - Seriously?

160
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,669
- Look. It's working. - It's better than one in my house.

161
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,104
(It's a unique combination of the old and new.)

162
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,273
She has so many books since she is a writer.

163
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,441
(Books are the must-have items for a writer.)

164
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,343
Hey, I think Se Mi plays guitar.

165
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,546
- What? - Do you play guitar?

166
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,581
- Do you really? - I guess she does.

167
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,882
No way.

168
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,617
- Se Mi, you do play guitar. - It's nice.

169
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,554
The color of her blankets is similar to Kwang Soo's blankets.

170
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,255
- The curtain is nice too. - It is similar to his.

171
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,691
By the way, we get to see Se Mi's stuff.

172
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:32,859
Her place is quite clean.

173
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,061
- Take your time. - Did you clean it?

174
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,196
- Did you cook a lot too? - What a cute place.

175
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,531
- It's cute and cozy. - I did. I have the rice cooker.

176
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,401
- She has a rice cooker for 1. - Yes, it's for 1 person.

177
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,936
How cute.

178
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,038
The rice cooker is really cute.

179
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,473
- This is how she cooks for herself. - That's correct.

180
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,609
- If she lives alone... - You take care of your body a lot.

181
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,643
- I do. - What are these?

182
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,779
- What are those? - You eat herbal medicine.

183
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,113
- She should. - She ought to have them.

184
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,281
She needs to when she lives alone.

185
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,817
You froze the food waste. You are good at housekeeping.

186
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,019
- Where is that? - She did freeze the food waste.

187
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,788
- Really? - She did?

188
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,691
Hold on. So we have to move everything in here?

189
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,460
We will start moving now.

190
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,195
This is your first mission.

191
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,463
There is a mission?

192
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,700
There are five things Se Mi will dispose of...

193
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:17,637
when she moves into her new house.

194
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:18,738
She will throw them out?

195
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,039
I already know what it's going to be.

196
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:26,479
Your mission is to put everything on the van except the five things.

197
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,482
In order to accomplish your mission,

198
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,585
you must be able to find at least 3 out of 5 things.

199
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,087
- This is... - Things she will discard?

200
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,888
Let's decide on this TV.

201
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,023
We should...

202
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,491
- This is... - We should throw this out.

203
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,293
- No, I think... - Let's get rid of it.

204
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:41,861
she wants to take this.

205
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,863
- This TV? - I think she wants to bring it too.

206
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,298
- It's because... - You think so?

207
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,735
this is the very first TV she bought when she started to live on her own.

208
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,937
- It is? - This has a sentimental value.

209
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,306
- It could be her guitar. - Is it the bed?

210
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,341
She might throw out the guitar.

211
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,243
- How about the doll? - Could it be the bed?

212
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,544
It's the doll her ex-boyfriend gave.

213
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,513
- She will take the bed, right? - The bed?

214
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,282
- The bed is quite small. - Clothes?

215
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,717
- Will she discard her clothes? - Clothes...

216
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,220
Hey, but isn't this too challenging for a mission?

217
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,422
- How can we read her mind? - Five things?

218
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,057
Don't you think she's going to throw out this curtain?

219
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,093
- Won't she definitely throw it out? - That curtain is...

220
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,361
I think the curtain came with the house.

221
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:17,864
- No, I think she put this up. - She installed the curtain.

222
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,234
- I have a feeling it's the bed. - You think so too?

223
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,102
I am not so certain.

224
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,171
This is too difficult.

225
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,206
- Won't she throw out this charcoal? - This doll?

226
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,574
- The charcoal? - This is...

227
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,109
I think she will throw this out.

228
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,878
Why would she? She can keep it at home.

229
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,846
She has to buy new one.

230
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,182
- It's collecting dust. - It gets dusty.

231
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,250
Why would this be here?

232
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,886
- That doesn't fit in here. - Doesn't it look out of place?

233
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,655
- It does look like it. - Does it go with this one?

234
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,657
These two don't match the rest of the furniture.

235
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,292
It's a bit wasteful to throw out the chair.

236
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:49,696
- I think she has a story behind it. - I bet she will throw this out.

237
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,699
- Let's move these first. - Let me get the boxes.

238
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,866
Shall we start with the floor?

239
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,270
- Hey, let's hurry. - It's in there.

240
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,371
- All right. - This is...

241
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,605
(They start with Ji Hyo's sign.)

242
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,873
We will take out these books now.

243
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,443
- Right, the books. - Get me a box.

244
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,646
She still has this book on Stanislavski. I have one too.

245
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,847
What did you say?

246
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,215
Stanislavski.

247
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,283
- Se Mi. - Yes?

248
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,884
Did you major in theater?

249
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,653
I majored in playwriting.

250
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:17,056
I knew it. I figured you did since you had this book on Stanislavski.

251
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:20,460
- I see. - So you know about Stanislavski.

252
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,994
- Stop it. - It's driving me crazy.

253
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:25,231
- Let me tell you about acting... - Come on.

254
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:28,868
- If you majored in acting... - You said his name so many times.

255
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,337
We only need to know Tchaikovsky.

256
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,139
- Unbelievable. - Stanislavski was...

257
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,241
Knowing Tchaikovsky is enough.

258
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,676
Se Mi. What a shame I didn't know about this sooner.

259
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,711
She has "Status Anxiety" by Alain de Botton.

260
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,581
- I like this writer. - Goodness.

261
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,350
- Se Mi. - Hey, Se Mi.

262
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,885
- I'm going to pack this. - All right.

263
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,287
- I'm going to pack this. - Sure. Go ahead.

264
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,056
Se Mi. Don't just stand there. Help us.

265
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,592
- You don't need these clothes yet. - Pass me that box.

266
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,693
- Can you pass me that box? - All right.

267
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,863
Se Mi. Can you give us a hint for us? Just one hint.

268
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,931
- Shall I give you a hint? - Yes.

269
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,135
I'm so busy that I don't have time to work out.

270
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:06,706
(She doesn't have time to work out?)

271
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:11,043
(Does it mean she will throw out things related to her exercise?)

272
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:14,147
- It's the scale. - That's right.

273
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,649
- It must be the scale. - Yes, it has to be the scale.

274
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,685
The scale is a way to check if she gained weight or not.

275
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,587
- It stresses her out. - You can't throw this out.

276
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,890
- But this is... - She should always check.

277
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,858
Or it could be her running shoes.

278
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,960
The reason why I thought it could be the scale is...

279
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,797
- It's been so long it had been on. - It doesn't work.

280
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,132
- Really? - We'll throw it out.

281
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,468
- Let's get going. - Hey, let's take this.

282
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,870
All right. Give me another box.

283
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,972
- We need slippers for this job. - This is heavier than it looks.

284
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,440
(They start moving her things.)

285
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,409
- In 1, 2... - Okay.

286
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,078
- Hey. - What?

287
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,713
How about throwing out the name tags?

288
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,817
It's because she's leaving Running Man now.

289
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,351
- That doesn't sound right. - Let's get rid of it.

290
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,786
- Do you want to throw these out? - She had to give it to her friend.

291
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:57,757
Se Mi. I signed this in February, 2016. It's been too long.

292
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,192
I haven't met my friend yet.

293
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,294
- When are you going to see her? - When will you meet her?

294
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,795
- You're moving now. - You don't see your friends.

295
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:06,465
How could you have not given Da Hae this? I signed this in 2016.

296
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,468
- She's waiting, but I couldn't. - Really?

297
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,003
- Just throw this out. - You should see your friends.

298
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,039
Just throw this away since you are moving.

299
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,874
- Will she take this? - What?

300
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,076
Don't you think she will leave this here?

301
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,679
- I think she will want that. - You think so?

302
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,148
Se Mi. Is there a story behind this chair?

303
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,117
My mom bought this to congratulate me on living alone.

304
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:26,419
- Your mom bought it? - Yes.

305
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,288
Since your mom bought this for you, it's meaningful.

306
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,691
Don't you like this chair?

307
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,492
(Sure, I like it.)

308
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,761
(I will put this on. I trust you.)

309
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:36,796
This has to be then.

310
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,731
- We have to bring this out. - Hold on.

311
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,767
We have to unload that thing. Why are we taking that?

312
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,936
- Take what? - That chair.

313
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,806
- We have to take that chair. - No, we shouldn't.

314
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:47,840
Hey, that chair...

315
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,809
- It's expensive. - It has memories.

316
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,178
Her mom bought it for the 1st time when she was 20 years old.

317
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,013
Is she on good terms with her mom?

318
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,782
Haha. She said they get along well.

319
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,050
We have to take this, right?

320
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,852
I have a feeling about this washing machine.

321
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,420
Let's take the washing machine.

322
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,656
- Should we? - No, she won't take it.

323
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,691
It's possible that she might not want to take it.

324
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,260
Will she take the vacuum?

325
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,861
- Check if it works. - Hold on.

326
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,063
- I'm looking at this... - See if it works or not.

327
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,632
- and this is way too dusty. - Did someone give this to her?

328
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,134
- Look at this part. - Exactly.

329
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,936
Doesn't that imply that she doesn't use this?

330
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,006
This does work, but it doesn't work well.

331
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,875
- This vacuum. - It is too dusty.

332
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,710
- It's dusty. - It doesn't work.

333
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,612
They can't even suck in the hair.

334
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,881
- Are you sure it's hair? - Get rid of this.

335
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,284
- She has to throw this out. - If she doesn't, she has a problem.

336
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,419
- This has to be trashed. - It doesn't work.

337
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,022
- She won't need it. - It's broken. She can't use it.

338
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,490
Leave it.

339
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,192
- Let's leave it. It's weird. - I think it's right to leave it.

340
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,161
It's because Se Mi...

341
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,663
- She's taking the fan. - It works.

342
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:48,434
(I have to find something to prove my capability.)

343
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,703
- Guitar. - Why is it here?

344
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,271
(Let me see.)

345
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,708
(He gazes at something while they struggle.)

346
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:00,212
(While everyone is busy,)

347
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,581
(he is investigating alone.)

348
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,216
What are some things here?

349
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,419
She will definitely take things like this mirror.

350
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,020
Of course, she will.

351
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:09,956
It's a chipmunk.

352
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,592
- We should take the mirror. - I've been watching you.

353
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,861
- Seok Jin, please work. - Wait, Seok Jin.

354
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,264
- Wait a minute. - What's wrong?

355
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,032
I've been watching Seok Jin.

356
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,834
- He doesn't work. - Look.

357
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,870
When we go out of the room, he goes into the room.

358
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:28,240
When we come back, he leaves the room.

359
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,444
- He doesn't do anything. - Come on, Seok Jin.

360
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:34,080
- I'm trying to be efficient. - Seriously.

361
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,715
- That's why I'm instructing. - Seok Jin, come and carry this.

362
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:39,151
- Come here, Seok Jin. - He's not doing any work.

363
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,820
Come and carry this.

364
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,488
I'm helping now.

365
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,489
(He barely works.)

366
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,791
Seok Jin.

367
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,861
What are you doing with that?

368
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,463
(He pretends to work.)

369
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,332
Why don't you take a nap if you have nothing to do?

370
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,068
- What are you doing? - He's going back and forth.

371
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,336
Goodness.

372
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:02,108
He moved recently, and his wife begged him to stay outside.

373
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:04,176
- There's nothing to clean. - What do you mean?

374
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,213
- There's so much to clean. - What should I do with this?

375
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,949
She hasn't packed up her clothes. We're in trouble.

376
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,284
(The room is still full of things.)

377
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,352
(It's very messy.)

378
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,288
(Is it time to take initiatives?)

379
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,891
(She starts to work efficiently.)

380
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,560
Se Mi.

381
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,863
She packed some things.

382
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:25,531
(Things pile up.)

383
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,601
(Ji Hyo takes care of packing.)

384
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:35,007
(Ji Hyo will help you move with the best service and hard work.)

385
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,876
Okay, Seok Jin.

386
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,445
- Yes? - Take these outside instead.

387
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,546
- Those? - Yes.

388
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,816
These are fragile, so be careful.

389
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:44,884
Okay.

390
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,487
- Ji Hyo is doing well. - She's so detailed.

391
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,257
- That's good, Ji Hyo. - Thank you, Jae Seok.

392
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,458
(Men carry things outside.)

393
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,760
- Take them out. - Where's Seok Jin?

394
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,696
He's moving the washing machine.

395
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,965
He's exaggerating again.

396
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,334
(He's trying to do the impossible.)

397
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,436
(He takes a peek.)

398
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:05,805
(I'm moving the washing machine.)

399
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:08,074
- Look at him. - He's showing off.

400
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,443
- No, I'm not. - He's pretending again.

401
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,611
He knows it's impossible to move it by himself.

402
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,447
He's being conscious of the camera.

403
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,382
Did you make an eye contact with him?

404
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,585
He's not even moving it. This is what he's doing.

405
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,821
(Exact eye contact with the camera)

406
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:24,657
(He pretends not to look at the camera.)

407
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,892
How can I move it? It's stuck.

408
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,661
Let him move the washing machine.

409
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,797
Let Seok Jin take care of the washing machine.

410
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,934
He'll be there until we finish moving everything out.

411
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,435
(Jae Seok is too smart.)

412
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,238
There was a man like him in the army.

413
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,973
(Seok Jin reminds him of someone.)

414
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,109
I remember those days.

415
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,443
(He reminds you of old memories.)

416
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,446
Come here and move it outside.

417
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,348
What's this?

418
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,584
She might leave it here.

419
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,054
Don't think that just because you don't want to move it.

420
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,723
(He's extremely lazy.)

421
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,293
Don't you think she'll leave it here?

422
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,562
This may be the case for new apartments.

423
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,864
(He starts to talk again.)

424
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,432
The former owner left the curtains.

425
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,634
(It seems like he procrastinates too much.)

426
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,236
- What? - You should do some work.

427
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:12,838
No one asked you to give a lecture.

428
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:16,275
What we take is more important.

429
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,943
Get us some water.

430
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:21,113
- Bring us some water. - Get it yourself.

431
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,381
Everyone, have some water.

432
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,750
- Can we drink it? - Get out of the way, Seok Jin.

433
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,819
Stop getting in the way.

434
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,454
(He gets in the way.)

435
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:29,755
You asked me for water.

436
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,791
Gosh, he gets in the way all the time.

437
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,460
(Seok Jin starts to do something.)

438
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,795
Turn it like this.

439
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:37,863
(He's unstable.)

440
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,632
- It doesn't fit. - Wait.

441
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:42,134
Get out of the way, Seok Jin.

442
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,836
(His lack of experience is obvious.)

443
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,105
- It works if you turn it. - What's the fuss?

444
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:49,642
(He causes more trouble than help.)

445
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:52,645
- Keep going. - Holding at the bottom is better.

446
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,380
(He doesn't help at all.)

447
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,447
My goodness.

448
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,749
(He's a nightmare.)

449
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,083
You should hold it like this.

450
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,985
He doesn't do any work.

451
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,754
(Seok Jin only talks.)

452
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,657
There's so much to do, but you aren't doing anything.

453
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,360
- She bought it to fit... - No.

454
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,262
the window size.

455
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:13,199
- Wait. What should we do? - It's too big.

456
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,333
She took it off.

457
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,834
It's because she wants to take it.

458
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,337
She had to take it off before moving out.

459
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,273
I think she used the same thing in the other room.

460
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,175
It's strange that there are no curtains.

461
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:27,246
- The blinds are difficult to fit. - We should take them.

462
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,415
What's this? Wait a minute.

463
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,218
Doesn't she exercise at home?

464
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,220
(Jong Kook is happy to find a pink yoga mat.)

465
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,621
Does she exercise at home?

466
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,389
- No, that's not it. - Look.

467
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,892
- Let's throw it away. - She said she doesn't exercise.

468
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,261
- Let's throw it away. - This could be it.

469
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,231
(The second possible item is a yoga mat.)

470
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,734
Let me see. What's that?

471
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,603
(Will she throw it away?)

472
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,304
She won't throw this away.

473
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,139
Se Mi.

474
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:57,109
- Take the towel. - Are you taking the charcoal?

475
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:00,846
(Jae Seok is suspicious of the charcoal.)

476
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,449
Se Mi, what are these?

477
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,819
I wear those slippers at home.

478
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,621
Have you used them?

479
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:09,822
(They look quite old.)

480
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,357
She won't take them.

481
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,993
Do you want to take them or not?

482
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,995
I have to take them.

483
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,063
- You want to take them? - I'll wear them.

484
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,432
Everyone, keep this in mind.

485
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:23,035
- What? - Se Mi said she'll use them.

486
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:26,305
- These look unused for a long time. - I don't believe it.

487
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,607
You can use after washing them.

488
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,609
Se Mi, just throw them out.

489
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,944
(We'll get you another pair.)

490
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,245
I'll buy you a new pair.

491
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,347
- What about these? - How about the shoes?

492
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,017
Can we pack them carelessly? They'll get mixed anyway.

493
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,752
Do you want to keep these?

494
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,087
(What's the point in asking?)

495
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,555
(She didn't wear them for a long time.)

496
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,557
- Will you wear them? - Aren't these props?

497
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,693
Ask her if she'll wear them.

498
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,561
Come on.

499
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,463
You don't throw things away, do you?

500
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,332
- Se Mi. - Don't wear them.

501
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,868
- These are too old. - You should throw them away.

502
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,137
You can wear these if you wash them.

503
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,872
Se Mi doesn't wear them.

504
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,008
- Please throw away these boxes. - She wants to take them.

505
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,044
Why do you keep the shoe boxes?

506
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:07,179
She stores things inside.

507
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,282
Se Mi collects alcohol bottles too.

508
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,351
- Leave her alone. - She's strange.

509
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:17,656
- Why do you collect these boxes? - She wants to take them too.

510
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,691
Look.

511
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,659
(These are the worst.)

512
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,361
(They look older than Se Mi.)

513
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,130
(They're pink sandals.)

514
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,333
(She likes those shoes.)

515
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,534
Everything is precious to her.

516
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,469
My mother used to wear them in the 60s.

517
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,371
- They're her great-grandmother's. - They're ancient.

518
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,707
My mom wore sandals like these in the 60s.

519
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:36,108
Please throw them away.

520
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,178
- Se Mi, please. - She wants to take them.

521
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,146
(The sandals look ancient.)

522
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,215
- She wants to take them. - Come on, Se Mi.

523
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,484
My mom wore sandals like these when she was young.

524
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,620
How can you keep these?

525
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,556
They're worn out.

526
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,058
- Throw them away. - They're vintage.

527
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,560
These are too raggedy.

528
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,095
(They can't accept them.)

529
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,063
- Throw them away. - She wants to keep them.

530
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,832
You'd better wear them!

531
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:01,433
Let her keep them.

532
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,335
They might be meaningful to her.

533
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,104
- What are you talking about? - Wait.

534
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,739
What's this?

535
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,942
- Se Mi. - Is it a snake?

536
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,510
Se Mi, what's this?

537
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,644
I don't know.

538
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,546
- Why do you have it? - Is it from the washing machine?

539
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,749
Are you throwing away the washing machine?

540
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,151
I found it in the house.

541
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,754
(Se Mi's rooftop house is full of mysteries.)

542
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:25,324
- It reminds me. - This was buried in the drain.

543
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,292
It was standing like this.

544
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:30,362
I've seen this a long time ago.

545
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,164
(It's incredible.)

546
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,932
(Her rooftop house is full of collections.)

547
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,801
Will she leave the trash bin?

548
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,137
- What? - The trash bin.

549
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:42,107
This is what I do when I move. Think about it, Ji Hyo.

550
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:45,744
Most people get a new trash bin when they move to a new place.

551
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,179
It's for a fresh start.

552
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,348
Isn't this too old?

553
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,683
That's not the only thing.

554
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,620
(She's too frugal.)

555
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,488
Let's move the refrigerator.

556
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,490
- Wait. - Let's move it.

557
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:02,694
(They move the refrigerator that's big and heavy.)

558
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,096
(They also move the washing machine.)

559
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,364
How did you take it out?

560
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,433
- Why couldn't you do it? - That's great.

561
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,435
- That's unbelievable. - In 1, 2.

562
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,136
- Let's lift it. - Okay.

563
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:12,971
(They move the furniture...)

564
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,374
(that filled Se Mi's old house.)

565
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,476
It's good for Jong Kook who wanted to carry heavy things.

566
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,611
- I know. Do I leave it here? - Yes.

567
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,979
(Seok Jin is on the truck.)

568
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,549
(He continues to talk while working.)

569
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:24,750
Are we almost done?

570
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,452
(They finish moving out as a team.)

571
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,821
(It looks almost empty.)

572
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,989
Did you leave the five items?

573
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:33,192
- These look similar. - That's not the one.

574
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:35,561
(It's time to choose five items to throw away.)

575
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,464
No one ever takes blinds when they move out.

576
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,998
- They don't fit. - Leave them here.

577
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,867
- Here you go. - The vacuum doesn't work.

578
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,435
They won't fit the window.

579
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,437
- She doesn't exercise, right? - No.

580
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,739
(The third item is a pink yoga mat.)

581
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,709
I don't think Se Mi would throw this away.

582
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:53,712
Of course, she won't throw it away.

583
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,814
- She'll take everything. - I saw her old sandals.

584
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,183
- She won't throw away anything. - This is what will happen.

585
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:00,219
Once she checks these five items,

586
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:02,221
she'll take them with her at night.

587
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:05,023
- I think so. - She'll wake up at night.

588
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,360
She'll come back in the middle of the night.

589
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,862
- That's possible. - I'm being serious.

590
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:12,231
(Who will win the first mission?)

591
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:14,132
Let's check the answer.

592
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,134
Here's Lee Se Mi.

593
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,135
(Here's the owner of the house.)

594
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,338
- Here's our writer. - Please come this way.

595
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,339
She won't take the scale.

596
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,241
- Right. - Among the five items,

597
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:24,776
take the ones you need.

598
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,046
(These are the items Running Man members chose.)

599
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:32,251
(More than 3 must be what Se Mi wants to throw away.)

600
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:33,852
Is there any?

601
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,120
Throw it away.

602
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,222
- It's broken. - It doesn't work.

603
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,191
(She takes the old trash bin and the vacuum.)

604
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,059
(They're precious to her.)

605
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,262
- It doesn't work. - Just throw them away.

606
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:44,363
(It's time to let it go.)

607
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,832
- It doesn't work. - Yes, it does.

608
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,834
- The vacuum doesn't work. - Come on, Se Mi.

609
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,203
It's pointless to use it.

610
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,271
(She's extremely frugal.)

611
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:54,473
Will she throw away these three items?

612
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:57,442
- Are we correct? - The three items are correct.

613
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,612
(They clear the first mission.)

614
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,214
- I don't believe it. - Thank goodness.

615
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,082
- Why isn't she taking that? - Among the five items,

616
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:06,752
she took the two oldest ones.

617
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,053
I don't understand.

618
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,221
- Why would you not take this? - It's brand new.

619
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,689
- Why aren't you taking this? - This is...

620
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:14,860
I got it as a gift, but I never used it.

621
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,261
- All right. - What are the last two?

622
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:18,397
Isn't that garbage bin better?

623
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,499
It's the drawer in the shape of a rabbit.

624
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,067
- The one that was here? - Yes, it was there.

625
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,069
That's right. I saw it.

626
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,572
The house I'm moving into is slightly smaller than this.

627
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,941
- It didn't fit. - You have no space.

628
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,809
- It was messy. - Right.

629
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,444
- What about the last one? - It was charcoal.

630
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:35,013
- I thought it was the nicest one. - Charcoal!

631
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,982
See? I told you.

632
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:40,018
- Who would take charcoal? - Hold on.

633
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,887
We won anyway. Why are you upset?

634
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:45,390
- He's right. - We won, so why are you upset?

635
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,293
You're not mad, but I am for some reason.

636
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,062
- What are you doing? - He usually gets mad.

637
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,930
We were happy that we won.

638
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,999
- We should be celebrating. - I agree.

639
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,567
- He's right. - That's right.

640
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,970
- You're so calm. - Of course.

641
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,372
- We have a long way to go. - You're right.

642
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,140
Why aren't you taking the scale?

643
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,176
- It's new. - I don't think...

644
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,844
it fits.

645
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,680
The numbers have nothing to do with your health.

646
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,850
- It doesn't. - They have nothing to do with it.

647
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,087
- People are mistaken. - You're too...

648
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,356
- What? - She said she's leaving it.

649
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:19,591
- But many people... - You don't have to be so mad.

650
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,193
- I guess you're right. - That's right.

651
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,462
- Don't be so mad. - They're making our lives easier.

652
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,497
- Don't you agree? - It's peaceful.

653
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:26,732
- Right. - Keep talking it out.

654
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:28,800
- You don't have to be mad. - I agree.

655
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,370
None of us told him this in seven years.

656
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,372
- Don't you agree? - I guess I do.

657
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,073
- That's right. - We never asked him...

658
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,842
why he always gets mad.

659
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:39,378
What he said about the charcoal was right.

660
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,747
He was right. I agree with you.

661
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:43,248
I agree too.

662
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,851
You have successfully completed your first mission.

663
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:49,321
You have obtained 30 Running Balls.

664
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,390
- Okay. - That's exciting.

665
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,393
- Let's move on. - Okay. Let's go.

666
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:56,261
- Here we go. - You haven't unpacked yet, right?

667
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,563
- Here we go. - It's a new house.

668
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,799
There isn't much to clean here.

669
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,368
We did it in one shot.

670
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:05,537
That was...

671
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:07,873
simple.

672
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:11,043
- She doesn't have much. - That was faster than I thought.

673
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,945
- That's right. - I want jjajangmyeon.

674
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,714
That sounds good.

675
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,282
I want jjamppong.

676
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,550
Let's have jjamppong.

677
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,753
- I don't know which one I want. - I'm craving it.

678
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,488
Kwang Soo.

679
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:24,623
(They arrive at Se Mi's new house.)

680
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:27,059
Jjajangmyeon, jjajangmyeon

681
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,660
This is where she's moving in.

682
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,362
It's...

683
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:35,767
(There are warm, brick houses and a nice street.)

684
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,736
(It's Se Mi's home.)

685
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,171
Look behind you.

686
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,341
- This is Se Mi's new house. - It's this one?

687
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:47,512
Your second mission will be happening on your way inside.

688
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:51,550
It's a mission that has to do with moving customs...

689
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,119
in order to wish her the best luck at her new place.

690
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,356
You must piggyback one member, and their feet can't touch the ground.

691
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:01,093
You must pass 4 stations in 99 seconds.

692
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:05,630
At the first station, you must drink salt water. It means to purify.

693
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,132
- We can't just drink water? - Salt water?

694
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,401
- You must pick salt water. - Kwang Soo should do it.

695
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:11,169
- Let's do rock, paper, scissors. - Go, Kwang Soo.

696
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:15,440
At the second station, you must throw your shoe in the basket.

697
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:20,212
At the third station, you must break a gourd with your bottom.

698
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:23,515
At the last station, you'll be given a question about an object.

699
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,584
You have to enter the house with that object.

700
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,420
You have 99 seconds to complete the mission.

701
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,322
- You have three chances. - I think we can do it.

702
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,690
We can do it.

703
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,291
We'll do a good one.

704
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,861
- Who are we? - Please choose the order.

705
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:38,263
The salt water station should be done by the unlucky ones.

706
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,832
- That sounds good. - It should be one of us.

707
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,801
- Let's decide. - Rock, paper, scissors!

708
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:46,805
- It's you. - Do it.

709
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,875
The unlucky one should be doing this.

710
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,209
(Kwang Soo is the unluckiest one here.)

711
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,711
Ready.

712
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:54,346
We can do it.

713
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,682
Get ready. Set...

714
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,751
(They get ready for "Moving Customs Relay".)

715
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:03,555
(If they don't win 30 Running Balls, they have to give up their house.)

716
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,690
Get ready. Set...

717
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:08,193
You have to hurry.

718
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,494
(Is that salt water?)

719
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:10,495
- Good job. - Is that right?

720
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,397
(Is it salt water or just water?)

721
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,266
(He drinks regular water.)

722
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,968
I knew it. He...

723
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,772
Time's ticking. You must drink salt water.

724
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,142
- It's regular water. - He fails again.

725
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,877
No wonder he's the unlucky one.

726
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,312
Kwang Soo.

727
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,081
Yes, Jae Seok. Hold on.

728
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:33,385
(It's his third attempt.)

729
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,520
- What's going on? - What's wrong with you?

730
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,389
What do you think you're doing?

731
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,691
You're supposed to drink salt water.

732
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:43,261
- This won't do. - What's wrong with you?

733
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,596
(What about his fourth try?)

734
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,700
That's right.

735
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,435
It's so salty!

736
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,404
(He passes the 1st station.)

737
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,607
(Next station is throwing a shoe into a basket.)

738
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,510
- Hold this. - Hurry. Hurry.

739
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:00,579
- Hurry. - You have to be precise.

740
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:02,881
- Slow down. - Here I come, Ji Hyo.

741
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,316
(They only have 15 seconds left.)

742
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:06,718
- In 1, 2, 3. - You have to get this.

743
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,455
(Take it, Ji Hyo.)

744
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,123
(Don't worry, Haha.)

745
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:15,293
(Please...)

746
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,963
- Oh, dear. - Hey.

747
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,998
(That's a home run.)

748
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,634
You were supposed to move faster, Seok Jin.

749
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,704
- Aim here, Haha. - You got it.

750
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,705
- We got it. - Goodness.

751
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,341
(Haha has a bad aim and Seok Jin has weak legs.)

752
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:31,676
That was a good one.

753
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,511
You are driving me nuts.

754
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,480
Let's focus on the next try.

755
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:38,283
What's wrong with Seok Jin and Kwang Soo?

756
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:41,119
Why did you keep missing salt water?

757
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,420
He's really unlucky.

758
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,890
- You're really unlucky. - I'll get it in one try.

759
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,092
It's not supposed to be hard.

760
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,194
- This is difficult. - It's not.

761
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:53,698
We need you to move faster, Mr. Jee.

762
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,267
I'm trying my best.

763
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:57,669
- You have to go lower. - He sounds mad.

764
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,070
Why are you calling me like that?

765
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,205
- Mr. Jee. - Aren't you mad?

766
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,207
This is a formal occasion, Mr. Jee.

767
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,308
Let's go.

768
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:04,843
We can do it.

769
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,311
Set...

770
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,479
(This is their second attempt.)

771
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:10,181
Let's go. Drink salt water.

772
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,719
- What's wrong with you? - Look at him.

773
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,888
(What's wrong with you?)

774
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,157
- This is strange. - I'll get it this time.

775
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,593
Look at the color. Open your eyes!

776
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,795
Look at the color. Open your eyes!

777
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,498
(It's just water again.)

778
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,867
- You punk. - Look at the color.

779
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,168
(His eyes move back and forth.)

780
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:33,405
- What's wrong with me? - What's he doing?

781
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:34,806
You can do it.

782
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,008
- That's salt. - I think it's the one on the right.

783
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,577
It's the right one. I can see it from far away.

784
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,546
(What about now?)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

785
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:44,649
My mouth is salty, so I can't tell. Try it. Is it salt water?

786
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:51,856
(It's salt water.)

787
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,792
- Hey. - Hurry.

788
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,493
This is the most difficult part.

789
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:57,095
Move fast.

790
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,863
- Give me the rope. - Mr. Jee.

791
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:00,832
- Lower yourself. - Let's go.

792
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,667
- Give me a good throw. - Lower yourself more.

793
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,502
- That's too far. - Move back.

794
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,705
- That's too far. - You have the other shoe, Haha.

795
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,707
- We can do it. - You have to get it.

796
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:10,709
- I'll give you a good throw. - You have to get it.

797
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,278
- Hey. - Hey.

798
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,814
(That was an out-of-the-park homer.)

799
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,949
- Why would you throw it so far? - Okay, sorry.

800
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:20,285
What are they even doing?

801
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,987
Are you playing a game amongst the four of you?

802
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,756
How many seconds? All right.

803
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:25,991
(Would it be over at the 2nd station again?)

804
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:28,259
You should have moved.

805
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:32,063
(Is the 2nd station the hardest?)

806
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:35,033
- Ji Hyo. - Why are you giving bad throws?

807
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,669
- Let's switch. - Move back, Haha.

808
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,105
Okay. Can you try this?

809
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,640
- Okay. - Let's go.

810
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:44,342
- Let's go. - Set...

811
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,011
(This is their last attempt.)

812
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,114
(Gagging)

813
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:50,415
(He drinks salt water on his first try.)

814
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:51,683
He's the best.

815
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,485
Stop faking it.

816
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:54,652
(It's the 2nd station again.)

817
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,021
Pass her over, Seok Jin.

818
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,823
- Come over. - You let go of me too early!

819
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,959
Don't rush.

820
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,861
- Seok Jin. - Seok Jin.

821
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,462
- That wasn't nice. - Let's go.

822
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:06,998
- Use 2 hands. - Get it in 1 try.

823
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,266
I'm ready.

824
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:09,768
(It's the same pitcher but with a better catcher.)

825
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:11,836
(He kicks his shoe.)

826
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:16,207
(We'll get it this time for sure.)

827
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:18,743
It looks good.

828
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,380
- Shoot. - Use your left shoe.

829
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,316
(That was close.)

830
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,186
Oh, dear. It's driving me nuts.

831
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:31,523
What are you doing, Seok Jin?

832
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,330
(Please help us.)

833
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:41,933
- We did it. - What are you doing?

834
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:45,770
(They finally pass the second station.)

835
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,073
- Hurry. - Who is it? Is it you?

836
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,274
(They get to the 3rd station on their 3rd try.)

837
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,575
Hey. There you go.

838
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:52,410
- There you go, Kwang Soo. - Okay.

839
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,113
- Do it in one try. - Oh, dear.

840
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,981
(Cracking)

841
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,149
There you go.

842
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:00,351
(That was a hard drop.)

843
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:04,789
(She can feel the pain radiating in her bottom.)

844
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:07,392
(It started in Mapo-gu,)

845
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,761
(and it's shaking up the entire Seoul.)

846
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:14,065
(It shook the entire Earth.)

847
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,234
- There you go. - Are you all right?

848
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:17,368
(Thank you for your sacrifice.)

849
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,237
- Are you all right? - I have to give her a piggyback?

850
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,239
Come here, Ji Hyo.

851
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,608
- What's the question. - Give me the question.

852
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,543
- Here's the question. - Is it just for him?

853
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:28,580
There's an object that's supposed to give you good luck...

854
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,682
if you move into a new place with it.

855
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:33,485
Find that object and enter the house.

856
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,987
- I have to find it? From here? - What is it?

857
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,822
- What is it? - You have to find it?

858
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:39,190
- What is it? - Ji Hyo.

859
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,492
Shoes?

860
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:42,093
(Shoes?)

861
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:47,632
(What do you bring to a new place?)

862
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,734
- Clock. - What could it be?

863
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,369
- Rice. Isn't this a rice cooker? - Is it here?

864
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,438
- Rice cooker. - Are you sure?

865
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,340
- It is. - It is. I saw it somewhere.

866
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,474
- Really? - I saw it on "I Live Alone".

867
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,810
- All right. - That's what they did.

868
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,345
- Go. - Hurry. Let's go.

869
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:03,781
- It's a rice cooker. - I think you're right.

870
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:05,016
- I'm 100 percent sure. - It's right.

871
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:07,218
- He's right. - Rice cooker.

872
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,387
(They choose a rice cooker.)

873
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:13,758
(Please... Please...)

874
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:14,792
Correct.

875
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,763
(Rice is supposed to give you wealth in cultures that eat mainly rice.)

876
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,465
- How did you get it right? - How did you know?

877
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,534
I remember watching it.

878
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:25,670
(They have 60 Running Balls total, and the staff has 20.)

879
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,438
It's time for lunch.

880
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:29,807
- There must be more. - Can you take the menu?

881
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:32,143
It's not a normal menu.

882
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,678
Can you just let us eat?

883
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,713
Don't do this.

884
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,082
(They're really annoyed.)

885
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,486
(They get food according to missions.)

886
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:43,555
You can't do this on a moving day.

887
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:44,856
- Let us eat. - This...

888
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,791
We have to eat Set C.

889
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,893
- We have to eat Set B at least. - Set C.

890
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:49,961
Here are the rules.

891
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:53,565
It's simple. Do you recognize this?

892
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:54,732
Is it just once?

893
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:59,270
If the pirate pops up before you complete a cycle, you get Set A.

894
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,407
- Complete a cycle, Set B. - Set B.

895
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:06,010
If you complete two cycles, it's Set C.

896
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,880
- Should I go? - Yes.

897
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,082
On your side?

898
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:12,984
(Jong Kook goes for it.)

899
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,787
(He does it easily.)

900
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:20,592
(He laughs at the next person to go.)

901
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:22,860
If the pirate pops up now, I'll be so mad.

902
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,362
- I'll be okay. - I'll stab you with this.

903
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:25,396
That won't happen.

904
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,532
(I trust you.)

905
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:32,203
(He always lost in this game.)

906
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:38,076
(He always makes the pirate pop out.)

907
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,646
(Would he do it again?)

908
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,014
(Clicking)

909
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,717
(Kwang Soo passes.)

910
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:48,019
- We only have to do it 12 times. - That's right.

911
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,855
- This is nothing. - They were being nice to us.

912
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,423
- This is nothing. - It's not.

913
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,259
You need to be confident with this.

914
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:59,497
(Jae Seok is the next unluckiest one after Kwang Soo.)

915
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:03,234
(How is he today?)

916
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:04,602
See?

917
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:06,004
(Jae Seok passes.)

918
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:08,506
Just put it in. There you go.

919
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:11,342
(Seok Jin passes as well.)

920
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:12,477
We're good.

921
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:15,446
(Ji Hyo passes as well.)

922
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,416
- We only have to do it once more. - It's Set B.

923
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:19,751
Let's go for Set C.

924
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:26,157
(The pirate pops up.)

925
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:27,392
(He's guilty.)

926
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:28,493
Hey!

927
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,496
(You punk!)

928
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:34,065
(There's no sweet and sour pork, or seafood platter for them.)

929
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:36,934
Why would you do that? It's you, Jong Kook.

930
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,569
I was going to do the other one, but I picked this one.

931
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:40,672
- Why would you do that? - Hey.

932
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,307
So we can't have sweet and sour pork?

933
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,375
- You can't. - Can we still have Set B?

934
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:47,712
My gosh. We almost had it.

935
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,348
- I can't reach the fried rice. - We could have had Set C.

936
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,183
I can smell it.

937
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:54,185
You're supposed to eat this on moving days.

938
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,820
- It's tasty. - It's delicious.

939
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:58,256
But seriously, Seok Jin...

940
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:00,458
is eating too much compared to how little he did.

941
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,492
I agree.

942
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,727
I worked so hard.

943
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,163
Remember when we were moving the washing machine?

944
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,465
(He pretended like he was helping.)

945
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,802
Is the jjamppong good?

946
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,840
(Jjajangmyeon and jjamppong are always good on moving days.)

947
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,974
It's really good.

948
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,377
(It's tasty.)

949
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:21,279
The soup is good.

950
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:26,250
(What is the next mission that's waiting for them?)

951
00:36:26,718 --> 00:36:28,853
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

952
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,855
(It's time to do work now.)

953
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,390
Let's move the furniture.

954
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,093
What's this?

955
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:37,395
There's something here.

956
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:41,733
The saying goes, if you organize your furniture...

957
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,335
according to topography, they'll bring you luck.

958
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:45,703
- That's right. - I've heard it.

959
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:50,808
Bed, sofa, mirror, desk, flower pot, and a desk lamp.

960
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,745
There are six items.

961
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,948
They are essential parts of topography.

962
00:36:57,014 --> 00:37:01,185
Place them wherever you think fits best.

963
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,756
We have invited an expert who'll verify your answers.

964
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:05,890
A topography expert?

965
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,459
- Here you are again. - Hello.

966
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:11,162
You told me not to do anything.

967
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:12,597
(It's Park Sung Joon, the fortune teller.)

968
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:17,135
(He's a fortune telling idol star, known for his cutting remarks.)

969
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:21,072
(You should stay low.)

970
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,274
You were so funny. You made us laugh.

971
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:24,475
I got a cramp.

972
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,145
(Slipping)

973
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:31,816
(He had his funny side behind his analytic skills.)

974
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:34,819
(He's Running Man's favorite fortune teller.)

975
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,254
Weren't you the one who got cramps?

976
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,488
(He's returns, looking healthier.)

977
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:38,823
- Did you get home safely? - Yes.

978
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,058
- He was sitting down for a while. - He collapsed.

979
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:46,297
If you get 4 out of 6 right, you win.

980
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:49,534
- Just four? - Do we bring them in?

981
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:51,469
Shouldn't Seok Jin and I stay still?

982
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,404
- Why? - He told us to.

983
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,106
- You can't. - He told us not to do anything.

984
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:56,641
You have to stay low.

985
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:58,576
Get started.

986
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,845
When we go into a house,

987
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,114
we know how beds are usually placed.

988
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:04,449
Let's just think simply.

989
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,084
Let's take them inside.

990
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:08,486
(He's stealth.)

991
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,055
(He sneaks in.)

992
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,892
(Seok Jin goes inside with light hands.)

993
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,727
It's good because it's the first floor.

994
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:17,728
Seok Jin.

995
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:20,431
- Is he just holding that? - It's just a flower pot.

996
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,600
How could he just take that?

997
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,336
Isn't that selfish?

998
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,505
- Are you holding that by yourself? - I'm okay.

999
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,539
- He is. - I'm all right.

1000
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,541
Hold on.

1001
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,777
- A mirror should be in the front. - Is it this way?

1002
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:33,811
Do we go this or that way?

1003
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,880
- This way. - This way is right.

1004
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:39,083
- In front of the bed... - I would put it in the middle.

1005
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,686
You have to face the window.

1006
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,221
Isn't it supposed to be by your head?

1007
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:46,224
You're supposed to face the curtain.

1008
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,692
The sun shines this way.

1009
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:48,860
Aren't you supposed to face the sun?

1010
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,662
No, I think the head should face this way.

1011
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,730
It should be this way.

1012
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,865
That's what most people do.

1013
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:55,233
Once you walk in,

1014
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,335
aren't you supposed to see the headboard?

1015
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,437
You're supposed to face it this way.

1016
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,072
- This way? - Isn't that what people do?

1017
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:02,673
Look at the power outlet.

1018
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,076
This is where you place the television.

1019
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:08,279
It's either of these two. It's this...

1020
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,715
- or that. - It's this way.

1021
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,283
- It looks stable. - I think it's this way.

1022
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,851
- No, it is not. - No,

1023
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,387
- the head goes this way. - That's where the head goes.

1024
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,456
- No, it's not. - Shouldn't you face the window?

1025
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,591
You're supposed to place the headboard...

1026
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:21,893
- by the window. - No, no.

1027
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:23,861
- Let's just hide the bed. - This is right.

1028
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,062
I'm sure this is right.

1029
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,765
- Let's just try it. - It's this way.

1030
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,166
It's good.

1031
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,168
- Where's the headboard? - This is not it.

1032
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,938
- One person holds while one lifts. - I'll lift.

1033
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:36,407
It's supposed to be the opposite.

1034
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:40,111
(Haha is the expert here.)

1035
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:41,879
- This is basic. - And then...

1036
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,515
I think it's right.

1037
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:45,750
Isn't this what people do?

1038
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,818
- This is right. - I'm sure.

1039
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:49,554
- This is right. - Is it?

1040
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,255
This is what I would do.

1041
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:52,957
- This is right. - Really?

1042
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,725
- Would you set it there? - You have to face the window.

1043
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,193
- Would you do it there? - The head would go this way.

1044
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:57,728
Like this?

1045
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,865
You can place the bed here and have the television there.

1046
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,466
Let's try it.

1047
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:03,568
I would do that.

1048
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:04,802
(Should we try it?)

1049
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,003
Is this it?

1050
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,371
This looks good.

1051
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,141
It's not bad, right?

1052
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,310
We changed our minds.

1053
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,311
What's this now?

1054
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:15,046
- It looks good. - Isn't this better?

1055
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,014
What do you think?

1056
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:19,283
You can leave things here.

1057
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,185
Rather than arguing over where the headboard goes,

1058
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,588
let's think about what people commonly do.

1059
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:24,722
This is the middle ground.

1060
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:25,890
This looks good.

1061
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:27,458
We don't know where to put the sofa.

1062
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,260
We have to move the sofa.

1063
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,294
Put it here.

1064
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,964
(Let's see what they did.)

1065
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,067
(Did they place the bed right according to topography?)

1066
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:39,203
I think the desk should go in this room.

1067
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:40,871
- I agree. - Can we put the sofa in this room?

1068
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,073
Hey. Move the desk.

1069
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,241
- Let's move it. - It has to go in the room.

1070
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,410
- The desk goes in this room. - You're right.

1071
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:48,613
- Let's put it here. - Put it in the room.

1072
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,281
Why would you put it there?

1073
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,282
This is it.

1074
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,551
- This is where you do work. - This is it. Put it down.

1075
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:55,886
There you go. This is it.

1076
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,856
Like this? There you go.

1077
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,592
- It looks all right. - It's not bad.

1078
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:03,861
Right. We have a desk lamp as well.

1079
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,496
We can put it there.

1080
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:09,667
(Should we move it by the bed?)

1081
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:13,537
(She places it by the headboard.)

1082
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:14,572
Se Mi.

1083
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,374
This... Se Mi.

1084
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:17,642
(Haha sets up the sofa by himself.)

1085
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:21,445
You can place a carpet here and hang out with your friends.

1086
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:24,382
I'm serious.

1087
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:27,385
You can make a home theater here.

1088
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:28,619
That's a good idea.

1089
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,887
(She answers reluctantly.)

1090
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:33,591
(Right? Isn't this great?)

1091
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:34,692
What are you doing?

1092
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,395
I think it'll be nice to put the television here.

1093
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:38,763
What are you talking about?

1094
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,866
- Who would do that? - I'm serious.

1095
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,834
It might not be right according to topography...

1096
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,236
- Move. Get lost. - You're wrong.

1097
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,004
That doesn't make any sense.

1098
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,239
Is this a hip-hop music video?

1099
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:49,774
You can place the projector there.

1100
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:52,543
- Move. - That's the new style.

1101
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,279
- Put it here. - It goes there. What did I say?

1102
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,049
It goes here, and you watch the television.

1103
00:41:58,049 --> 00:41:59,116
- No, Seok Jin. Look. - Is that right?

1104
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:00,885
- Place the television here. - How would you do it?

1105
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,586
Place the television here,

1106
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:04,021
and you can welcome your visitors.

1107
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,356
Who watches the television like this?

1108
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,490
This is how you watch it.

1109
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:08,092
Why don't you...

1110
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,161
just set it up however you want and live here?

1111
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,962
- That's not it. - Come on.

1112
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,765
- Don't you get it, Jae Seok? - Let's just do it.

1113
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,868
- Where do I put this? - I think the flower...

1114
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,970
- should face the entrance. - I agree.

1115
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:21,672
I think it goes here.

1116
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,275
- What about this side? - I think this is right.

1117
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:25,876
- What about the mirror, Ji Hyo? - Where should we put it?

1118
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,344
It goes here.

1119
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:31,015
You shouldn't see the mirror as soon as you walk in.

1120
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,551
Why shouldn't it be there?

1121
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,720
He says you shouldn't be able to see it when you open the door.

1122
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:37,488
Why not?

1123
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:40,224
This is good. Look.

1124
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,259
- That's a good place. - It's by the bathroom.

1125
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:45,162
You can look at yourself before going out...

1126
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:46,864
- and leave. - Put it there.

1127
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,667
- Have you made up your mind? - Put it on the floor.

1128
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:50,801
We made up our minds.

1129
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:52,937
How many do we have to get right?

1130
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,239
You must get at least 4 out of 6.

1131
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,474
That's not easy.

1132
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:57,775
(How many did they get right so far?)

1133
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,076
How does it look?

1134
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:03,047
I watched you as you placed the items.

1135
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:05,216
What Haha said...

1136
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:06,951
- was mostly wrong. - Right.

1137
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,019
(Everything Haha said was wrong.)

1138
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,988
What's wrong with him?

1139
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,592
(Haha was being bossy with his loud voice.)

1140
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:15,693
I'm being serious.

1141
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:20,765
(He was too ambitious without much knowledge.)

1142
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,233
(He pretended to know feng shui.)

1143
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:23,300
(He was only a fool.)

1144
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:26,170
Who puts the sofa here and faces that way?

1145
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:28,205
(Wasn't it sensible?)

1146
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:30,007
- That's only what you like. - That's my thought for Haha.

1147
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:33,210
Half of what Jong Kook said was correct.

1148
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,945
I was wrong half of the time.

1149
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,515
On the other hand, Jae Seok and Ji Hyo...

1150
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:40,417
were almost always correct.

1151
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:42,419
However, you couldn't stay with the plan.

1152
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:44,221
They wouldn't listen to me.

1153
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:45,890
- I agreed with them. - I couldn't stay with the plan.

1154
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:48,692
- How should we arrange things? - We can cooperate.

1155
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,861
- Right? - That's why we're a team.

1156
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:53,798
We must work as a team, not as individuals.

1157
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,065
- We're a team. - A team.

1158
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:57,601
Among the six items,

1159
00:43:57,601 --> 00:44:01,338
there's only one that was correctly arranged.

1160
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,174
- Only one? - It must be the bed.

1161
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:06,877
There was one more that was close to being correct.

1162
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:09,346
- It was correct by 70 percent. - There are 2.

1163
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:12,516
In other words, you correctly arranged 1.7 items.

1164
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:15,219
- We failed. - What about in the bedroom?

1165
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,054
In the bedroom...

1166
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:20,391
(They arranged 3 items in the bedroom.)

1167
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:22,393
(Nothing was arranged correctly.)

1168
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:24,862
- Nothing was correct. - I knew it.

1169
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,864
I told you it should be over there.

1170
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,065
The room looks great though.

1171
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:30,401
- Starting now, - It should be over here.

1172
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,570
you have five minutes to rearrange.

1173
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:34,772
- The flowers are correct. - Get out of the way.

1174
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:36,674
The bed isn't in the right place.

1175
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,576
(Jae Seok raises his voice thanks to the feedback.)

1176
00:44:38,576 --> 00:44:40,544
Who put the camera here?

1177
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:43,180
- It was in the corner. - We should move the bed.

1178
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:45,249
(Some of them lower their voices.)

1179
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,051
Get out of the way.

1180
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:48,619
- It's the bed. - Move.

1181
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:50,888
(They rearrange the room under Jae Seok's order.)

1182
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:52,523
- Put the desk here. - Okay.

1183
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,391
That's perfect.

1184
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,261
- This is good. - It looks cozier.

1185
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:58,562
- Right? - This looks good.

1186
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:00,931
- It looks so different. - She can come in the room.

1187
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:02,600
She can unpack here.

1188
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,868
- That's right. - That's right.

1189
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,102
(The angle is perfect to lie down.)

1190
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,304
- This is great. - She can lie down.

1191
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:09,707
- She can say hello to her mom. - "Hello, Mother."

1192
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,309
- The window is right there. - She can open the window.

1193
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,178
- That's right. - There we go.

1194
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:15,679
(He smiles mysteriously.)

1195
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,082
- Let's go. - You only have three minutes left.

1196
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:19,350
You have three minutes.

1197
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,885
The sofa is in an awkward place.

1198
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:22,052
It's awkward.

1199
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,889
- We should move it this way. - What I said before is correct.

1200
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,323
I think this is correct.

1201
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:29,293
Let's move the lamp first.

1202
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,595
- I'll put it next to the desk. - Put it here.

1203
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:33,464
There you go.

1204
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:36,934
All we have to do is move the sofa, right?

1205
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:39,403
The sofa should be moved all the way here.

1206
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,138
Let's move it then.

1207
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:43,307
- Can we push it in more? - We moved everything together.

1208
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:45,009
I think this is a good place.

1209
00:45:45,009 --> 00:45:47,378
Can we put the sofa against this wall?

1210
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,180
- That's possible. - Put it there, Ji Hyo.

1211
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,582
Put it against this wall.

1212
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,551
(They rearrange the sofa according to Ji Hyo's advice.)

1213
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,186
- It's better to face the sun. - If you put it there...

1214
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:58,255
- How about this? - What are you doing?

1215
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,323
(The men are gullible.)

1216
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:00,891
I think this is cozier.

1217
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:02,793
This is according to feng shui.

1218
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:04,194
It's about facing the sun or not.

1219
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:07,398
- Let it face the sun. - She can drink some coffee here.

1220
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:09,400
- Move out of the way. - Throw away the television.

1221
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,368
- She can watch the blue roof. - Right.

1222
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:13,604
Why are you carrying it around?

1223
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,439
(The blue roof is good to look at.)

1224
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,607
This is the right place.

1225
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,808
(They rearrange the sofa.)

1226
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:20,177
- Let's move the flower pot. - It should face the sun.

1227
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:22,413
- The plant needs light. - Shouldn't it be there?

1228
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:24,815
- This is what was wrong. - We should move them there.

1229
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:26,884
- Let's see. - Which direction is the east?

1230
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:29,086
Seok Jin puts them carelessly.

1231
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:31,088
- Okay. - We can put it there.

1232
00:46:31,322 --> 00:46:32,423
Look at the plant.

1233
00:46:32,423 --> 00:46:34,358
Plants should face the sun.

1234
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:35,793
- Right. - Don't you know that?

1235
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,962
When you said that, he laughed.

1236
00:46:38,062 --> 00:46:39,596
(Seok Jin should stay quiet.)

1237
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:40,864
He laughed at you.

1238
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:44,201
What do you think of what Seok Jin did?

1239
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,804
What he did didn't make a difference.

1240
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,405
(His action didn't make a difference.)

1241
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:51,275
I told you not to do anything.

1242
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:52,810
Just stay still.

1243
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,511
It's better that you stay still.

1244
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:57,614
- The plant isn't the problem. - It isn't.

1245
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,817
- It's the mirror. - It must be the mirror.

1246
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:03,620
Perhaps, the mirror shouldn't be in the living room.

1247
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:05,889
- Put it in the room. - Here.

1248
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:07,358
- Here? - This looks good.

1249
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:08,692
- We finished. - We're done.

1250
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:09,893
(They finish rearranging.)

1251
00:47:10,361 --> 00:47:11,862
(How many items are correct?)

1252
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:13,998
He'll review each item.

1253
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,166
I'm worried about the plant.

1254
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,935
The first item is the flower pot.

1255
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:20,771
Normally, flowers should be...

1256
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:22,673
placed in the kitchen.

1257
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:23,807
(The plant is placed correctly.)

1258
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:25,075
- Close to water? - Yes.

1259
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:26,710
Many people put plants in the kitchen.

1260
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,046
We put it in the bedroom instead.

1261
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:32,249
It's also correct to put it in the bedroom.

1262
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:35,619
That's why what Seok Jin did didn't make a difference.

1263
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:38,889
There are sources of water and fire in the kitchen.

1264
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:41,191
Water puts out fire.

1265
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,961
The plant needs water, and it burns to make fire.

1266
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:45,796
They create synergy.

1267
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:48,866
That's why it's good to put plants in the kitchen.

1268
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,702
- Next is the sofa. - I'm curious about that.

1269
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,405
It's best to place the sofa where you can face people...

1270
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:56,206
when they enter the house.

1271
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,543
I told you. It must be clearly visible to people.

1272
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,878
Is that the right place?

1273
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:05,416
It's good to put it here to invite the family and guests.

1274
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:07,518
It's bad to have your back on people.

1275
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:11,855
- We were wrong. - It's good to put it in the corner.

1276
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:13,590
- That's the best place. - That place was correct.

1277
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,793
That's why this is the best place.

1278
00:48:15,793 --> 00:48:17,761
It's not completely facing the back.

1279
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,263
You can welcome the guests from here.

1280
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:21,565
You can turn to the side.

1281
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:24,334
- You can turn to the side. - It's possible.

1282
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:26,336
When you welcome guests,

1283
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:29,139
the location of the sofa isn't important.

1284
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:30,841
As soon as they come in,

1285
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:32,876
it's better to run towards them.

1286
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,879
Based on what you said, the sofa should be here.

1287
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,415
(He's lost for words.)

1288
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:41,118
The other items are in the room.

1289
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:43,220
- I'll tell you in the room. - Okay.

1290
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,523
- At first, you placed the bed here. - Right.

1291
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:48,392
However, this direction is the south.

1292
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:50,861
- And this is the east. - Right.

1293
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:53,063
It should point southeast.

1294
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,498
When you enter the room,

1295
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:56,700
it's best to lie down with the head pointing to the corner.

1296
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,136
- You were right. - Yes.

1297
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,305
- That's the most stable. - I knew it.

1298
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:03,240
It made me feel comfortable.

1299
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,875
The bed is in the right place.

1300
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,677
(The bed is in a good place.)

1301
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:07,945
It was exactly right.

1302
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:09,379
Next is the desk.

1303
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:12,349
This is the right location.

1304
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:14,585
(The desk is also correct.)

1305
00:49:14,585 --> 00:49:17,421
It's best to put the desk toward the east...

1306
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:19,823
because it's where everything revives.

1307
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:24,561
It's good to keep the door visible from the desk.

1308
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:27,030
- I think it's perfect here. - Don't keep the back to the door.

1309
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:31,168
My instincts told me that this was the perfect place.

1310
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:32,669
(Stop bragging.)

1311
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:35,105
Where were you thinking of putting the mirror?

1312
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:38,041
- We thought of here. - On the wall?

1313
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:42,179
Arranging the mirror there would bring...

1314
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:45,415
- bad luck to Se Mi. - Really?

1315
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:49,119
The worst place to put the mirror is facing the bed.

1316
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:50,821
(No wonder!)

1317
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,890
- As such, the mirror should be... - Right.

1318
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:55,792
- It shouldn't face the bed. - I had a mirror facing my bed.

1319
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:57,961
- Then I had nightmares. - Right.

1320
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:01,698
- The mirror can create chaos. - That's right.

1321
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:04,168
- I should rearrange my mirror. - Me too.

1322
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,136
The mirror should be placed...

1323
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:09,006
either on the right or the left of the entrance.

1324
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:11,808
This is the right place.

1325
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:15,412
Mirror on the left of the entrance increases your financial luck.

1326
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:18,882
If it's on the right, it increases your luck in honor.

1327
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:21,618
You put the mirror in the wrong place.

1328
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:23,954
It should be near the entrance.

1329
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,356
- You got 3 correct. - We got 2 wrong.

1330
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,457
You missed two items.

1331
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:30,561
If the lamp is in the right place, you win.

1332
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:33,463
If not, you lose.

1333
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:36,300
Lighting should be...

1334
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,769
- in the bedroom. - Right.

1335
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:42,206
Also, it's better to keep the bedroom dark.

1336
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:45,475
It's where people rest and keep their belongings.

1337
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:48,946
However, there was one time...

1338
00:50:48,946 --> 00:50:52,216
you placed the lamp correctly.

1339
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:54,618
(They were correct one time.)

1340
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:56,687
(What does that mean?)

1341
00:50:57,321 --> 00:50:59,256
(In other words,)

1342
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:00,591
(someone moved it.)

1343
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:03,393
However, someone moved it.

1344
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,662
- Was it Seok Jin? - She moved it by herself.

1345
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:07,598
- Was it me? - Ji Hyo...

1346
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:11,668
moved the lamp from the bed to here.

1347
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:12,970
Let's move the lamp first.

1348
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:15,772
(Ji Hyo came to move the lamp alone.)

1349
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:19,476
- It was Ji Hyo. - The lamp is in the wrong place.

1350
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:24,982
(Running Man has 10 Running Balls, and the staff has 30.)

1351
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,085
Here's the last mission.

1352
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:30,621
It takes place in Running House,

1353
00:51:30,621 --> 00:51:33,090
which can be our new resting place.

1354
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,192
You must clear the mission...

1355
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:38,195
in a chicken restaurant, a hair salon, and a yoga academy.

1356
00:51:38,362 --> 00:51:41,198
You must obtain the digits of the passcode.

1357
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:44,134
3 teams must clear the mission in 30 minutes.

1358
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:46,136
You succeed when you return to Running House.

1359
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:48,672
- Let's go. - Please go now.

1360
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,040
(Let's beat the staff.)

1361
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,043
(They take off.)

1362
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,245
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo: yoga academy)

1363
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:56,613
(Jong Kook and Haha: chicken restaurant)

1364
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:57,981
(Seok Jin and Ji Hyo: hair salon)

1365
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:00,017
- Enjoy yoga. - Thank you.

1366
00:52:00,017 --> 00:52:01,418
(Each team must obtain a digit.)

1367
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:03,387
- Okay, let's go, everybody. - See you later.

1368
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,957
- See you later. - See you later.

1369
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,092
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo arrive at a yoga academy.)

1370
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,162
(What mission awaits them?)

1371
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:15,499
- It should be someone flexible. - I'm not flexible at all.

1372
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:18,001
Here's your mission.

1373
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:20,570
It's called "Namaste Picture Quiz".

1374
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,172
- "Namaste"? - Yes.

1375
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:24,341
"Namaste" is Hindi.

1376
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:28,011
Both of you will perform a yoga position.

1377
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:32,215
One of you will draw with a pen in your mouth.

1378
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:34,985
The other must guess what it is.

1379
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:37,421
Here are the poses.

1380
00:52:37,421 --> 00:52:38,989
(It's a difficult mission.)

1381
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:42,059
- These look difficult. - These positions are extreme.

1382
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:43,593
They're very popular yoga positions.

1383
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:46,396
We can't do yoga at all.

1384
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:50,067
We'll give you a digit of the passcode if you clear the mission.

1385
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:51,168
(Answer 4 questions in 60 seconds.)

1386
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:54,137
(We hope they answer at least one.)

1387
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:56,807
- 4 out of 6? - Yes.

1388
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,142
Kwang Soo, watch carefully.

1389
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:00,711
Let's start now.

1390
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:02,579
(Jae Seok is the drawer.)

1391
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:03,847
Get ready.

1392
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:05,782
(He trembles.)

1393
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:07,017
Get ready.

1394
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,852
Set...

1395
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:11,421
("Namaste Picture Quiz" begins.)

1396
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,890
(The first word is "piano".)

1397
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:16,360
(Jae Seok begins to draw.)

1398
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,061
(Piano)

1399
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,931
(He draws without hesitation.)

1400
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,400
We don't have much time. Hurry up.

1401
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,036
(He draws without hesitation.)

1402
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,772
(Kwang Soo is getting anxious.)

1403
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:32,008
(Struggling)

1404
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,645
(Focused)

1405
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,050
(It's quite realistic.)

1406
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,818
- Kwang Soo. - Please hold it higher.

1407
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:45,956
- Piano. - Correct!

1408
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,792
(They get the first question right.)

1409
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:50,594
(Jae Seok is unexpectedly talented.)

1410
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:54,231
Jae Seok, you draw better with your mouth than with your hand.

1411
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:59,569
(When he drew with his hand, the drawings turned out terrible.)

1412
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:04,040
(He drew an alien when he was supposed to draw a kangaroo.)

1413
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:07,444
(Jae Seok is usually a terrible drawer.)

1414
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:11,314
Jae Seok is good at everything that makes him use his mouth.

1415
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:13,283
(He draws without hesitation.)

1416
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:15,552
You draw better with your mouth than with your hand.

1417
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,888
(Amazed)

1418
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:19,890
I'm done!

1419
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:21,291
I'm done!

1420
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:24,394
(It's a masterpiece.)

1421
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:25,662
- Glasses. - Correct.

1422
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:27,431
How can he draw so well with his mouth?

1423
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:31,735
(His back and teeth start to ache.)

1424
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:34,004
(Grapes)

1425
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,980
What is this sound? What are you doing?

1426
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:46,516
You're supposed to be drawing.

1427
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:51,621
We don't have much time.

1428
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:54,691
(The grapes start to take form with unpleasant noises.)

1429
00:54:55,192 --> 00:54:58,361
(Time is running out.)

1430
00:54:58,361 --> 00:54:59,763
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1431
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,865
- Kwang Soo. - I can't see it.

1432
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,100
- I can't see it. - Look at this.

1433
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,937
- Look at this. - I really can't see it.

1434
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,773
(Shaking)

1435
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:11,641
Look at that.

1436
00:55:12,576 --> 00:55:13,610
Look at that.

1437
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:17,514
Look at the drawing.

1438
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:20,717
- Kwang Soo, look at that. - I really can't see it.

1439
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,886
My goodness, this is so frustrating.

1440
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:24,888
Look at the drawing.

1441
00:55:25,222 --> 00:55:27,123
Look at the drawing.

1442
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:28,959
- Grapes. - Correct.

1443
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,761
(They get the third question right too.)

1444
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:34,564
(They have to get just one more right.)

1445
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:36,132
I'm dizzy.

1446
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:40,837
Jae Seok, my eyes were almost spinning.

1447
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,474
(The king of mouth drawing starts another piece.)

1448
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:47,177
Kwang Soo.

1449
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:48,245
Kwang Soo.

1450
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:51,982
TV? Computer? PC?

1451
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:54,718
- What's that? - A pig!

1452
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:57,053
- A pig! - What?

1453
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:59,022
- A pig! - What?

1454
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,958
That's the nose of a pig.

1455
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,861
Kwang Soo, that's obviously a pig.

1456
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,596
(His drawing is minimalistic.)

1457
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:09,065
Kwang Soo, that's obviously a pig.

1458
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:11,101
Do you want me to hit you?

1459
00:56:11,268 --> 00:56:13,503
- What are you talking about? - That's obviously a pig.

1460
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:16,306
- That's obviously a pig. - I thought it said, "PC".

1461
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:18,975
- My goodness. - That was so close.

1462
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:22,112
- Kwang Soo, you should do better. - Your drawings were amazing.

1463
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:23,580
I know.

1464
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,081
(Their first try failed.)

1465
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:30,020
(Chicken restaurant)

1466
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,223
Gosh, it looks so tasty.

1467
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:37,060
(The delicious smell of fried chicken welcomes them.)

1468
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,161
Okay.

1469
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:39,362
(Here is the mission.)

1470
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:40,864
"Battle with Customers".

1471
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:44,434
"When someone orders delivery, go to the customer's house."

1472
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:47,404
"Play a game related to chicken against them."

1473
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:50,607
- Are we delivering chicken? - Yes.

1474
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:53,376
What if no one calls within 30 minutes?

1475
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:55,579
- Then you'd fail. - What?

1476
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,281
Let me make it clear.

1477
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:01,484
When someone orders delivery, go to the customer's house.

1478
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:04,421
You'll complete the mission if you manage to...

1479
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:07,657
finish the children's song, "Animal Farm".

1480
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:09,459
("Animal Farm"?)

1481
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,162
("Animal Farm" is a popular song among children.)

1482
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:15,498
(With all kinds of animals, the lyrics are complicated.)

1483
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:19,936
You have to sing the parts with a hen, a goat, and a calf.

1484
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:23,373
(The customer has to finish the parts Jong Kook and Haha sing.)

1485
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:27,510
(They practice first.)

1486
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,447
- It's been such a long time. - Is it "quack, quack"?

1487
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,582
Under the pear tree

1488
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:35,151
- Is a goat under the pear tree? - A goat.

1489
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:38,588
(The lyrics sound strange after such a long time.)

1490
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:42,092
(This is too difficult.)

1491
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:45,261
Give us a mission where we have to eat.

1492
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:47,998
There are many foreigners around this area.

1493
00:57:47,998 --> 00:57:50,600
A Japanese person wouldn't know this song.

1494
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:53,436
(Hair salon)

1495
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:54,804
- We're here. - We're here.

1496
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:59,542
This is Ji Hyo's territory.

1497
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:01,077
(The others got difficult missions. What about them?)

1498
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:02,512
- Look at this. - What's that?

1499
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:06,016
- Do we sit here? - Just sit here?

1500
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:07,617
Like this?

1501
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:09,085
- Let me give you a mission. - Okay.

1502
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:12,288
The mission is called, "Invisible Texting".

1503
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:15,091
Under your gown,

1504
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:17,560
without looking,

1505
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:20,664
you have to type, "What's the passcode?"

1506
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,700
Then you have to send it to me.

1507
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,403
If both of you send it without any typos,

1508
00:58:26,403 --> 00:58:28,338
you'll get a digit of the passcode.

1509
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:32,375
Every time you fail, we'll put one perm rod...

1510
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:34,678
- on you. - Don't do that.

1511
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:37,747
You should do it. My hair is tied.

1512
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:39,249
- Really? - Yes.

1513
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:42,519
- Please put on your gowns. - I'm wearing hair powder.

1514
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:47,791
(I'm sorry. I didn't know.)

1515
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,393
Let's just try.

1516
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:51,461
(Seok Jin, we're sorry.)

1517
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,096
All right. It's okay.

1518
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,565
(They practice.)

1519
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:57,467
- "What's the passcode?" - "What's the passcode?"

1520
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:59,335
- With a question mark? - Let's do this.

1521
00:58:59,803 --> 00:59:01,171
I think I can do it.

1522
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:02,639
You do it.

1523
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,874
I'm not sure if I can press the "send" button.

1524
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:06,176
Let's go.

1525
00:59:06,176 --> 00:59:07,477
(The phones go under.)

1526
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:09,479
- Let's start if you're ready. - Okay.

1527
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:10,513
(This is their first attempt.)

1528
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:11,648
Start.

1529
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:16,286
(Thumbs, you can do this.)

1530
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:19,689
Where's the space bar?

1531
00:59:21,091 --> 00:59:23,660
"What's..."

1532
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:24,861
(They have to rely on their senses.)

1533
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:27,564
"What's the passcode?"

1534
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:30,767
- Did you receive it? - Not yet.

1535
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:32,302
- Not yet? - No.

1536
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:34,337
I pushed the "send" button a hundred times.

1537
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,606
- Did you still not get it? - No, I didn't.

1538
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:37,941
I sent it.

1539
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:40,276
- I got one. - Did you?

1540
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:41,845
It's probably correct.

1541
00:59:41,845 --> 00:59:45,715
(Did their first try succeed?)

1542
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:46,950
(Not a single typo is allowed.)

1543
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:50,353
There are typos.

1544
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:53,256
(It's full of typos.)

1545
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:55,792
It was almost right, wasn't it?

1546
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:57,093
Mine is a mess.

1547
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:00,063
(She pushed another button instead of the "send" button.)

1548
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:02,699
Send it.

1549
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:03,967
Manager.

1550
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:06,469
Who's the manager?

1551
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:09,372
Hello.

1552
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:11,641
(You'll get a perm rod.)

1553
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:15,445
I think we'll be here until dinner time.

1554
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:17,981
Will we be able to finish it?

1555
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:19,282
(Will they be able to do it by today?)

1556
01:00:19,883 --> 01:00:21,785
Has anyone succeeded?

1557
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:23,586
(Remaining time)

1558
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:25,655
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo try for the second time.)

1559
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:30,193
Jae Seok, this time, we'll be able to do it.

1560
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:34,531
Jae Seok, you're talented.

1561
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:38,868
(It's an accurate drawing of a candy.)

1562
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:41,304
- A candy. - Correct.

1563
01:00:41,538 --> 01:00:44,040
(They got the first question right.)

1564
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:46,943
(Keep up the good work, Jae Seok.)

1565
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,145
(Struggling)

1566
01:00:51,548 --> 01:00:53,216
Jae Seok, time is running out.

1567
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:55,652
(Will they be able to finish it within 60 seconds?)

1568
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,820
Jae Seok.

1569
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,588
(Kwang Soo lifts his body.)

1570
01:00:58,588 --> 01:00:59,589
A rabbit.

1571
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,192
(The get the second question right.)

1572
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:06,963
(Kwang Soo is already feeling dizzy.)

1573
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:09,632
(Kwang Soo, hang in there.)

1574
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:12,702
(Drawing)

1575
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,239
- Are you done? - Yes.

1576
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:17,440
(They have to get just two more questions right.)

1577
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:21,211
A bicycle.

1578
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:23,947
(The get the third question right.)

1579
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:27,317
(It's the last question!)

1580
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:29,652
It's the last one. We're almost there.

1581
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:33,122
(Jae Seok is drawing with all his might.)

1582
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:34,757
Good.

1583
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:38,561
(Kwang Soo, look at this.)

1584
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:42,866
(We don't have much time. You know what this is, right?)

1585
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:45,969
- An apple. - Correct.

1586
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:48,705
(He says the correct answer right away.)

1587
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,374
- There you go. - We did it.

1588
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:53,476
We did it.

1589
01:01:54,244 --> 01:01:55,245
Great work.

1590
01:01:55,245 --> 01:01:56,646
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo worked well together.)

1591
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,782
- It took 50 seconds. - Jae Seok.

1592
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:01,284
It was possible.

1593
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,886
This is unbelievable.

1594
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,022
I'll give you 1 of the 4 digits.

1595
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,857
(They get one digit of the passcode.)

1596
01:02:07,991 --> 01:02:09,158
- It's 1. - It's 1.

1597
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:10,793
(One of the digits is 1.)

1598
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:14,664
(Meanwhile)

1599
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:18,234
We might get an unprecedented outcome.

1600
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:23,072
(The phone hasn't rung in 14 minutes.)

1601
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:27,210
If the phone doesn't ring, we fail our mission.

1602
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:30,079
(Someone needs to call.)

1603
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,881
Who would order delivery at this hour?

1604
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:33,383
(Silent)

1605
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:36,386
- This is too difficult. - Right?

1606
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,155
What is that?

1607
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:40,189
I'm getting scared.

1608
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:43,893
Have you ever thought...

1609
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,963
this mission might be in favor of the staff?

1610
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:48,598
- At least once? - Never.

1611
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:50,333
Are you serious?

1612
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:51,634
(Determined)

1613
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:53,069
That was funny.

1614
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:55,505
The original plan was to make you sing the refrain as well.

1615
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:56,873
- How does it go? - What is it like?

1616
01:02:56,873 --> 01:03:00,576
(Only the difficult part is left.)

1617
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:02,412
(It's all meaningless if no one calls.)

1618
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:03,980
This song is...

1619
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:06,616
This song is...

1620
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:08,885
(The phone rings.)

1621
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:10,420
You have a call.

1622
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:11,554
Should I pick up?

1623
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:12,956
It can't be.

1624
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,291
We can't take the order.

1625
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,993
(Is this a delivery order?)

1626
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:18,261
We have an order.

1627
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:22,298
(Finally, they receive an order.)

1628
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:24,434
- Sir, do we have an order? - Yes.

1629
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:25,835
What did they order?

1630
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:27,036
No bones, half sauce-half original.

1631
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:28,204
I see.

1632
01:03:28,338 --> 01:03:31,841
Say that you deliver the food at this hour.

1633
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:35,445
They won't look presentable when they come out to get the food.

1634
01:03:35,445 --> 01:03:36,879
- Right. - Aren't I right?

1635
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:40,249
It's possible they might not want to be filmed.

1636
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:41,851
Today, the order...

1637
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,387
- came from a cafe. - What?

1638
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:45,722
Is that so?

1639
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:48,658
- I'm glad. - A cafe ordered chicken?

1640
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:51,661
Oh, right. Then it must be for the workers.

1641
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,163
I think they will cooperate in filming, right?

1642
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:56,132
This is nice.

1643
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:58,201
(Half of a crispy, fried chicken)

1644
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:00,169
- Let me come with you. - Will you?

1645
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,571
All right. Let's head out.

1646
01:04:01,738 --> 01:04:02,839
Let's go.

1647
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:05,775
(They set out with no bones, half sauce-half original.)

1648
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:07,844
- This does look delicious. - It does.

1649
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:09,879
(He hugs the chicken.)

1650
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:10,880
It might get cold.

1651
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:15,852
(They deliver the food by the owner's car before it gets cold.)

1652
01:04:16,386 --> 01:04:17,954
It goes from hen...

1653
01:04:19,756 --> 01:04:21,491
(He's remembering the lyrics.)

1654
01:04:21,491 --> 01:04:22,492
Goose is next.

1655
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:25,561
- It's hen, goose, goat, and calf. - Right.

1656
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:28,398
(They are working hard.)

1657
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:32,568
If they are young, they might not know the lyrics.

1658
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:35,271
(They have only 10 minutes left.)

1659
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:36,305
This is it, sir.

1660
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:37,874
- I don't have to come out, right? - Please come with us.

1661
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,376
Inside the henhouse.

1662
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:41,744
Inside the henhouse.

1663
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:44,547
(Who will receive the fried chicken and sing in return?)

1664
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,349
Who ordered fried chicken?

1665
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:49,185
(Who will sing in exchange for fried chicken?)

1666
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:53,589
Did you order fried chicken?

1667
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,293
(I ordered, but why are they here?)

1668
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:58,995
This looks delicious.

1669
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:01,431
(He will determine the result of the mission.)

1670
01:05:01,431 --> 01:05:02,598
We are...

1671
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:06,002
going to do a mission.

1672
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:07,737
Can you help us?

1673
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,106
(If he refuses, the mission fails by default.)

1674
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:12,141
- This is a very simple mission. - What is it?

1675
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:13,509
It's relay singing.

1676
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:16,379
We will sing the beginning, and you can finish the lyrics.

1677
01:05:16,446 --> 01:05:18,581
- It's quite simple. - It is. Let's try it.

1678
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:19,882
Let's give this a try.

1679
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:22,385
- It's a children's song. 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

1680
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:24,253
Inside the henhouse

1681
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:27,256
There is a hen

1682
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,892
(He gets the first animal correct.)

1683
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:31,961
Next to the doorway

1684
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:33,196
(This is the hard part.)

1685
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:37,667
("Doorway" itself is unfamiliar enough,)

1686
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:40,436
(but on top of that, an uncommon animal, goose, is in the lyrics.)

1687
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,638
Next to the doorway

1688
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:47,143
There is a goose

1689
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:50,446
(He gets the second animal correct.)

1690
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,815
Under a pear tree

1691
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:54,250
(This is harder than the previous one.)

1692
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:59,088
(A pear tree is strange enough, but there's a goat under it.)

1693
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:03,793
(For a young adult, this line could be the hardest.)

1694
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:05,661
Under a pear tree

1695
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:08,197
(Will he be able to manage this crisis?)

1696
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:12,568
(Under a pear tree)

1697
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:15,605
There is a goat

1698
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:19,742
(How amazing! He gets the third animal correct.)

1699
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,811
In the stable

1700
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:24,680
There is a calf

1701
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:27,383
(He's the king of children's songs.)

1702
01:06:27,884 --> 01:06:29,252
(They accomplish the mission.)

1703
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:30,987
We did it. We accomplished the mission.

1704
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,054
- How did this happen? - We did it.

1705
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:33,723
- How is this possible? - How can this happen?

1706
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:34,991
Do you know this song?

1707
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,459
He's amazing.

1708
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:38,961
Thank you so much.

1709
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:40,463
Did you go to kindergarten?

1710
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:41,864
- I did. - You did?

1711
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,066
- You are awesome. - He must've learned it there.

1712
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:45,368
- How can this be? - Goodness.

1713
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:46,769
We came here thinking we wouldn't succeed.

1714
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,337
Let me buy this chicken.

1715
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:50,273
- Let us buy it. - Enjoy the food.

1716
01:06:50,273 --> 01:06:51,974
- Thank you. - It's on us.

1717
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:53,743
- Let us treat you. - Thank you.

1718
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:55,278
- Unbelievable. - How did he guess the animals?

1719
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:58,648
- Do you know this song? - In the stable

1720
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:00,082
There is a calf

1721
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:02,351
Gosh. It's like a national anthem.

1722
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:03,553
(They discover a national anthem.)

1723
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:05,188
(The last destination, Running House)

1724
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,590
- Se Mi's house is there. - It's where we started.

1725
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:08,791
Right.

1726
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:11,694
(After accomplishing their mission, Jae Seok and Kwang Soo arrive.)

1727
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:12,862
What is this?

1728
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:14,497
We did it.

1729
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:18,301
(Are we the first ones here?)

1730
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:21,571
(Remaining time)

1731
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:22,805
Other members didn't come yet.

1732
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:25,007
(They should be arriving soon.)

1733
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:28,644
- You have eight minutes left. - Hey, hurry.

1734
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,146
(Running)

1735
01:07:30,246 --> 01:07:31,447
Hey, you need to hurry.

1736
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:33,482
- What is it? - Hey, run faster.

1737
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:35,484
Wait, we weren't the first ones?

1738
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:39,222
Our mission was really challenging.

1739
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:40,590
- Really? - It was by far the hardest.

1740
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:42,391
- We had to deliver food. - And then?

1741
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:43,793
Press it now.

1742
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:44,860
(It will be a success when Seok Jin and Ji Hyo arrive.)

1743
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,696
- Okay! - What did you do there?

1744
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:48,064
Where is Seok Jin?

1745
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:50,433
(Remaining time)

1746
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:52,001
What happened to him?

1747
01:07:52,335 --> 01:07:53,636
We don't have much time left.

1748
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:56,239
This is so frustrating.

1749
01:07:57,873 --> 01:08:00,810
Aren't you putting too much effort into it?

1750
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:03,412
Excuse me.

1751
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:04,981
Could you just wrap it up?

1752
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:06,882
I can't do this.

1753
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:09,385
Can you shorten the number of words?

1754
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:11,687
Please put more perm rods on them.

1755
01:08:11,687 --> 01:08:14,557
- I knew this would happen. - This is too challenging.

1756
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:17,193
My hair is short. I don't have any hair left for that.

1757
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,263
This is frustrating.

1758
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:22,064
This is why he irritates me.

1759
01:08:22,732 --> 01:08:26,002
- Come on. - Darn Seok Jin.

1760
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:27,770
This time, we will try this.

1761
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:31,307
- What is it? - How about just "passcode?"

1762
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:32,408
Are you serious?

1763
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:33,542
- Just those words, right? - You are certain, right?

1764
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:35,544
- "Passcode?" - With the question mark.

1765
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,380
Hold on. Sending it is the problem.

1766
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,081
It's hard to send it.

1767
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:40,750
"Passcode?"

1768
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:43,219
(Pressing the send button isn't the only problem.)

1769
01:08:44,387 --> 01:08:46,255
You said it just has to be under the gown.

1770
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:48,190
You are not allowed to look.

1771
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:50,192
Why? It's under the gown.

1772
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:51,594
(She focuses with her eyes closed.)

1773
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,196
(Pressing)

1774
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:57,433
(She manages to send it without any typos.)

1775
01:08:57,867 --> 01:08:59,635
(Ji Hyo succeeds.)

1776
01:09:00,102 --> 01:09:02,171
I did it. I did it!

1777
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:03,205
(Passcode?)

1778
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:06,676
(She escapes from the trap of typos.)

1779
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,244
(Darn it.)

1780
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:09,345
I need to succeed too.

1781
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:11,580
This is so frustrating.

1782
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:13,883
I only have four letters to type.

1783
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:16,118
Here it goes. I can do it!

1784
01:09:16,118 --> 01:09:17,586
(He must succeed now.)

1785
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:18,654
Seok Jin.

1786
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,389
All right. What's next?

1787
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:22,058
I typed it three times,

1788
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:23,793
and I sent it.

1789
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,028
Seok Jin, you accomplished it as well.

1790
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:28,831
(Seok Jin and Ji Hyo accomplish their mission.)

1791
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:29,965
We did it.

1792
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:32,034
Seok Jin, you succeeded too!

1793
01:09:32,702 --> 01:09:33,736
We did it.

1794
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:35,204
In 8, 7...

1795
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:37,740
(We did it, but the time has run out.)

1796
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:40,710
- In 3, 2... Gosh. - That's it.

1797
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,478
- They failed. - Shoot.

1798
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:44,880
Seok Jin.

1799
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,083
- Thank you. - Goodness.

1800
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:48,517
Ji Hyo. Hurry.

1801
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:52,755
(Only these two are in a hurry. We have time left, right?)

1802
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:54,657
Where is it? Where?

1803
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:55,958
Is this the building?

1804
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:58,394
Gosh.

1805
01:09:58,394 --> 01:09:59,662
What's going on?

1806
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:02,565
You would've looked the same if you went there.

1807
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:05,434
- Ji Hyo. - It suits you.

1808
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:07,002
- This is funny. - It's driving me crazy.

1809
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:09,438
Ji Hyo, what happened? Why do you look like that?

1810
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:12,074
Since one team didn't arrive in time,

1811
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:14,276
I will give you 10 Running Balls.

1812
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:15,444
(They receive 10 Running Balls.)

1813
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:17,413
- What was your mission? - The passcode...

1814
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:19,982
- is 0613. - It's 0613?

1815
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:22,451
The four-digit number represents Se Mi's birthday.

1816
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:25,020
I won't ever forget her birthday.

1817
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:29,692
- So far, the score is 2 to 2. - That's right.

1818
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:31,660
Both teams have 80 Running Balls.

1819
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:33,662
- This is a close match. - All right.

1820
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:37,833
We will open the door and draw the final Running Ball.

1821
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,535
- It's 0613. - I'm nervous.

1822
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:41,637
- Ji Hyo. We will get it, right? - The passcode is simple.

1823
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,439
- Look at that. - What do we do when we draw it?

1824
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,242
We will put them in it and draw from it.

1825
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:49,245
These are all mixed. Please put them into it.

1826
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,814
- Kwang Soo... - If the staff wins, it's his place.

1827
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:53,749
- How can you say that right away? - If the staff's Running Ball is...

1828
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:55,985
drawn, it has to be one of your houses.

1829
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:58,154
- Your place is the most convenient. - It's not just about convenience.

1830
01:10:58,154 --> 01:10:59,989
We all live with someone.

1831
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:02,691
- You live alone. - We live with our family.

1832
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:03,993
(I might end up moving.)

1833
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:05,294
- Here we go. - Hey, give that to me.

1834
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:07,596
(The draw of fate starts.)

1835
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:09,031
- Here it goes. - All right.

1836
01:11:10,533 --> 01:11:12,368
- Here we go. - Okay.

1837
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:15,204
- Let us start. - In 1, 2, 3.

1838
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:16,439
(If they win, this place will be their resting place.)

1839
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:18,541
(If the staff wins, one of the members will sacrifice.)

1840
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:20,309
- Look. - It came out.

1841
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:23,612
- All right. - If it says "Running Man", we win.

1842
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:26,015
If it says "Running Man", you win.

1843
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:28,317
- Do you want to switch? - Kwang Soo.

1844
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:29,585
Please, Jae Seok.

1845
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:33,556
- If we lose, it's Kwang Soo's home. - Yes, it is.

1846
01:11:33,556 --> 01:11:35,191
- Hold on. - It will be your house.

1847
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:37,159
In 1, 2...

1848
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:39,462
(This is the last moment of the dangerous deal.)

1849
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:45,034
(What will be the result of this deal?)

1850
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:47,837
Three.

1851
01:11:48,571 --> 01:11:51,740
(Running Man's Running Ball is drawn.)

1852
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:52,775
Three.

1853
01:11:53,209 --> 01:11:56,712
(Hooray! We will seize this resting place.)

1854
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:57,813
- Kwang Soo. - We saved him.

1855
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,548
- We saved him. - We did.

1856
01:11:59,548 --> 01:12:01,851
- Don't worry. - Your place is safe now.

1857
01:12:01,851 --> 01:12:03,352
- No need to worry now. - Kwang Soo.

1858
01:12:03,586 --> 01:12:05,788
- Kwang Soo. - I was so nervous.

1859
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:08,357
I wanted to go to his place.

1860
01:12:08,591 --> 01:12:10,025
Congratulations.

1861
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:11,660
- This is good for us. - Right.

1862
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:14,063
The victory goes to you.

1863
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:15,130
(Running Man members take the victory.)

1864
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:18,400
- This will be our resting place. - Thank you.

1865
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,768
(I like this resting place.)

1866
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:21,504
Can we use this place whenever we want?

1867
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:22,671
- Yes. - Whenever?

1868
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:24,874
The secret behind Running House...

1869
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:26,976
will be revealed soon.

1870
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,312
(The Secret behind Running House?)

1871
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:33,983
(What is the secret behind this rooftop house?)

1872
01:12:33,983 --> 01:12:35,017
There's a secret?
