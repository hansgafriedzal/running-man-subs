1
00:00:05,974 --> 00:00:08,214
Previously on Running Man...

2
00:00:08,744 --> 00:00:12,414
(Last week, the Running Man
members won the resting place.)

3
00:00:13,274 --> 00:00:15,243
(However, )

4
00:00:15,244 --> 00:00:17,543
(it's not over.)

5
00:00:17,544 --> 00:00:20,143
You have to bring all the things
you wrote in the wish list.

6
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:21,144
(The mission is to decorate
the resting place.)

7
00:00:21,145 --> 00:00:22,543
(There is only one rule.)

8
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:24,013
(Self-sufficiency)

9
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:25,343
(The members call their friends...)

10
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,543
(without mercy.)

11
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:30,543
(There are endless donations from
top stars we can only dream of.)

12
00:00:30,544 --> 00:00:31,544
Is In Sung here?

13
00:00:31,545 --> 00:00:32,913
(The strange, self-sufficient mission...)

14
00:00:32,914 --> 00:00:35,714
(is unpredictable.)

15
00:00:36,214 --> 00:00:38,044
This is unbelievable.

16
00:00:38,974 --> 00:00:42,413
(And the secret behind the roulette
that decides their destiny)

17
00:00:42,414 --> 00:00:45,113
(The strange, self-sufficient mission
is breathtakingly exciting.)

18
00:00:45,114 --> 00:00:47,844
(Running Man starts now.)

19
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:49,674
Come in.

20
00:00:49,714 --> 00:00:53,044
- This is our resting place.
- It's a real resting place.

21
00:00:53,074 --> 00:00:56,073
- This is our home. For all of us.
- Now that the furniture is gone...

22
00:00:56,074 --> 00:00:57,414
(They moved in last week.)

23
00:00:57,774 --> 00:00:59,973
- It looks smaller unlike before.
- It has heating too.

24
00:00:59,974 --> 00:01:03,813
Welcome to Running Man's new resting place.

25
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,443
- Yes.
- No, wait.

26
00:01:05,444 --> 00:01:08,574
We should be the ones to
welcome you to our house.

27
00:01:08,614 --> 00:01:11,544
- We can kick you out. It's ours.
- It's our home.

28
00:01:12,144 --> 00:01:15,444
On the empty floor plan of this house,

29
00:01:15,844 --> 00:01:19,374
write down your wish list...

30
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:22,913
including things you want
and things you need.

31
00:01:22,914 --> 00:01:25,543
(Write down your wish list as you wish.)

32
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:26,614
- Claw crane.
- Gosh.

33
00:01:26,914 --> 00:01:29,173
- Machines too?
- Like the ones in arcades.

34
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:31,173
- Whatever we want?
- I want claw cranes too.

35
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,343
I used to want them when I was young.

36
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:35,343
(Today's mission is to fill
in the empty floor plan.)

37
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:36,543
- Really?
- I see.

38
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:39,413
First, we need a television
in the living room.

39
00:01:39,414 --> 00:01:42,143
- Yes.
- We need to monitor the show.

40
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,413
- We need a television.
- Yes, right there.

41
00:01:44,414 --> 00:01:46,144
- TV.
- Next to the other one.

42
00:01:46,644 --> 00:01:49,343
- How about two claw cranes here?
- We don't need them.

43
00:01:49,344 --> 00:01:52,013
- Why do you need them?
- It's fun.

44
00:01:52,014 --> 00:01:54,043
- Claw cranes come here.
- Claw cranes are supposed to be...

45
00:01:54,044 --> 00:01:57,173
- connected to the manufacturer.
- No, we can buy one separately.

46
00:01:57,174 --> 00:01:59,344
- Really?
- It's in Yeongdeungpo.

47
00:02:00,014 --> 00:02:01,314
Sunbed.

48
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:04,174
- Okay.
- Is it for tanning?

49
00:02:04,244 --> 00:02:07,643
This one is probably Kwang
Soo with a long waist.

50
00:02:07,644 --> 00:02:09,843
- Kwang Soo!
- No, it's not me.

51
00:02:09,844 --> 00:02:13,574
- It looks like your waist.
- But it has short legs.

52
00:02:13,744 --> 00:02:15,943
It's not me.

53
00:02:15,944 --> 00:02:17,883
- How would you know?
- A bed in the bedroom.

54
00:02:17,884 --> 00:02:20,073
- We should get 2 mattresses.
- Okay, 2 mattresses.

55
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:23,173
- Let's make this a playroom.
- Let's make this a playroom.

56
00:02:23,174 --> 00:02:26,843
- With disco balls.
- Disco balls?

57
00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:28,643
- Mirror balls.
- I like disco balls.

58
00:02:28,644 --> 00:02:31,243
- Disco balls.
- We also need mattresses.

59
00:02:31,244 --> 00:02:33,143
- Cover the floor with the mattress.
- Put them on the floor.

60
00:02:33,144 --> 00:02:36,943
All right. We can sleep anywhere
if the mattress covers the floor.

61
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:39,743
- I like it.
- And a basketball stand.

62
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,413
- I like it too.
- Let's hang it from the ceiling.

63
00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:43,813
- Let's put a dart board here.
- I like it.

64
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:46,613
- I like it too.
- Next to the basketball stand?

65
00:02:46,614 --> 00:02:48,343
- All right.
- Next to the basketball stand.

66
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:52,243
Maybe we could put chairs and
barbecue grills instead of sunbeds.

67
00:02:52,244 --> 00:02:55,443
We could have parasols, too.

68
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:58,913
- Let's get one.
- It's better.

69
00:02:58,914 --> 00:03:01,543
- A parasol and chairs.
- All right.

70
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:04,273
- We could sit there to talk.
- That's enough.

71
00:03:04,274 --> 00:03:06,173
- Chair.
- A rug.

72
00:03:06,174 --> 00:03:08,243
- We need a sofa here.
- A zebra-patterned rug.

73
00:03:08,244 --> 00:03:10,713
- All right.
- You should do everything.

74
00:03:10,714 --> 00:03:12,643
- Haha.
- I learned the tricks.

75
00:03:12,644 --> 00:03:14,073
Don't we need a bidet?

76
00:03:14,074 --> 00:03:16,073
- Are we really getting claw cranes?
- I need a bidet.

77
00:03:16,074 --> 00:03:19,014
- Are we really getting claw cranes?
- We need a bidet.

78
00:03:19,674 --> 00:03:21,713
- Don't put a bidet here.
- Why?

79
00:03:21,714 --> 00:03:23,874
- They put cameras in here.
- Come on.

80
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:26,944
I don't care about having cameras,
but they need to be blurred.

81
00:03:27,644 --> 00:03:30,143
- Let's put a model figure here.
- Don't.

82
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:33,544
- Don't. That's what you want.
- Here?

83
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,713
Why do you erase it? Please.

84
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:37,944
Can't you just stand there?

85
00:03:38,014 --> 00:03:40,044
Why?

86
00:03:40,174 --> 00:03:41,773
I need to shoot Running Man.

87
00:03:41,774 --> 00:03:43,814
He should be in the Avatar costume.

88
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:45,973
You should stand there.

89
00:03:45,974 --> 00:03:47,613
(Avatar figure, 190cm, for free)

90
00:03:47,614 --> 00:03:50,714
It takes three hours for me
to get dressed as an Avatar.

91
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:53,913
- You could stay there every day.
- Can I put a full-length mirror?

92
00:03:53,914 --> 00:03:55,414
You can.

93
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:57,443
I need to see myself when I shower.

94
00:03:57,444 --> 00:04:01,014
- Why would you take a shower?
- It needs to be over 190cm.

95
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,143
It's a waste of money.

96
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:07,543
- Put a small one.
- Then we need hair dryers, too.

97
00:04:07,544 --> 00:04:10,073
- See? We need hair dryers, too.
- Hair dryers.

98
00:04:10,074 --> 00:04:12,273
- We also need shampoo and rinse.
- We need towels.

99
00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:14,273
- We need towels.
- And washing machine for towels.

100
00:04:14,274 --> 00:04:15,643
(Everyone criticizes intensely.)

101
00:04:15,644 --> 00:04:17,813
- How much is the mirror?
- Haha.

102
00:04:17,814 --> 00:04:21,343
- How much is the mirror?
- Haha.

103
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,243
- Take it out.
- The two wishes I made were erased.

104
00:04:23,244 --> 00:04:26,143
- Stop it.
- We have a mirror.

105
00:04:26,144 --> 00:04:29,073
- Kwang Soo.
- Why would we need a bigger mirror?

106
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:30,774
Who wrote down zebra-patterned rug?

107
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:33,544
It was me. Wait.

108
00:04:33,644 --> 00:04:36,013
- Who wrote that down?
- You can't get away with this.

109
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:38,343
- This is unnecessary.
- Why?

110
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:41,543
- Why would you need the design?
- Then what have I done today?

111
00:04:41,544 --> 00:04:43,713
Get out. Get out.

112
00:04:43,714 --> 00:04:45,544
- This is my house.
- Get out.

113
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,374
My house contract is over soon.

114
00:04:47,444 --> 00:04:49,013
- Are you finished?
- Yes.

115
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:51,214
Now, you have to bring...

116
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:52,844
the items you wrote down.

117
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:56,913
(Where can we get...)

118
00:04:56,914 --> 00:04:59,144
(all of these?)

119
00:04:59,344 --> 00:05:01,614
- Bring them?
- Bring them?

120
00:05:01,914 --> 00:05:04,273
- Give us 20,000 dollars.
- Without money?

121
00:05:04,274 --> 00:05:06,374
(How do we get them without any money?)

122
00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:08,214
Where would I get a bidet?

123
00:05:08,544 --> 00:05:10,143
Do we need the sunbed?

124
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:11,183
- No.
- No.

125
00:05:11,184 --> 00:05:13,343
(They wrote down so much without thinking.)

126
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:16,873
- Good thing we erased the zebra.
- It is. I wasn't thinking straight.

127
00:05:16,874 --> 00:05:19,273
Today's mission is...

128
00:05:19,274 --> 00:05:20,844
Decorate Your Place.

129
00:05:21,344 --> 00:05:23,443
If you fail to bring everything,

130
00:05:23,444 --> 00:05:26,713
- there will be an annoying penalty.
- Annoying penalty?

131
00:05:26,714 --> 00:05:28,973
- What would it be?
- We probably need to come here.

132
00:05:28,974 --> 00:05:31,843
We will decide the number of
people getting the penalty...

133
00:05:31,844 --> 00:05:34,143
according to the number
of things you missed out.

134
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:36,843
To save more people, - Yes.

135
00:05:36,844 --> 00:05:38,914
Bring as much as you can.

136
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:42,414
There is a chance card...

137
00:05:42,544 --> 00:05:44,744
for each product you bring.

138
00:05:44,974 --> 00:05:46,343
It's important you get them fast.

139
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:48,513
We can't divide the teams
according to the area...

140
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,243
because we don't know
where we could get them.

141
00:05:51,244 --> 00:05:54,373
- It will be hard to get a sofa.
- Sofa.

142
00:05:54,374 --> 00:05:56,243
I could ask my dad.

143
00:05:56,244 --> 00:05:58,873
- All right.
- I could call him.

144
00:05:58,874 --> 00:06:01,273
He likes to be on television too.

145
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:03,913
He doesn't like to be on television.

146
00:06:03,914 --> 00:06:06,543
He smiles when the camera focuses on him.

147
00:06:06,544 --> 00:06:09,543
- He is very smiley.
- Your dad...

148
00:06:09,544 --> 00:06:12,574
You could get a sofa, a rug,
and a table from the company.

149
00:06:12,644 --> 00:06:15,443
- In the Running Man office...
- That's right.

150
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:18,973
- They have these things.
- They do.

151
00:06:18,974 --> 00:06:21,343
- I will get the mattress.
- All right.

152
00:06:21,344 --> 00:06:23,143
- And the parasol.
- All right.

153
00:06:23,144 --> 00:06:25,343
I can get the parasol
from my stylist's office.

154
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:28,343
- Okay then.
- Then our first destination...

155
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:30,443
- will be the Running Man office.
- It's not clean.

156
00:06:30,444 --> 00:06:32,443
- We'll bring what we can.
- Okay.

157
00:06:32,444 --> 00:06:36,173
- Okay. We'll go now.
- I think we could find a rug.

158
00:06:36,174 --> 00:06:38,513
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

159
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:40,944
(Decorate Your Place starts now.)

160
00:06:41,814 --> 00:06:43,043
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin heads to SBS.)

161
00:06:43,044 --> 00:06:45,714
We need to get a lot of things.

162
00:06:45,744 --> 00:06:48,144
Is it okay to take things from SBS?

163
00:06:48,414 --> 00:06:50,543
- It won't matter, right?
- Where do you shoot Running Man?

164
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:53,543
- SBS.
- Where does the show broadcast?

165
00:06:53,544 --> 00:06:56,214
- SBS.
- That's why we're going to SBS.

166
00:06:56,544 --> 00:06:59,344
- It's very persuasive.
- It's okay.

167
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:03,214
We're here. Okay.

168
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:04,444
Let's go.

169
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:06,773
(They look like sons coming
home to take Mom's food.)

170
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:09,813
- They might have everything.
- They might.

171
00:07:09,814 --> 00:07:12,273
- They might have everything.
- It's always SBS.

172
00:07:12,274 --> 00:07:14,143
- Yes, it's SBS.
- It's here.

173
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:16,344
- Where?
- Gigantic claw crane.

174
00:07:17,544 --> 00:07:19,913
- You're right.
- Can't we take it home?

175
00:07:19,914 --> 00:07:21,044
(They find a gigantic one.)

176
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,344
It looks fun.

177
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,614
Hey,

178
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:27,343
where are you going?

179
00:07:27,344 --> 00:07:28,413
(He finds an actor.)

180
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,644
Hello.

181
00:07:29,974 --> 00:07:33,013
(It's Son Hyun Joo who appeared
in Running Man twice.)

182
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:35,343
- Where are you going?
- I had a radio broadcast.

183
00:07:35,344 --> 00:07:36,813
A radio?

184
00:07:36,814 --> 00:07:38,374
When will you come out
on Running Man again?

185
00:07:38,444 --> 00:07:40,343
Let's run now.

186
00:07:40,344 --> 00:07:42,373
(He's ready to go.)

187
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:43,913
(Hyun Joo is always full of drive.)

188
00:07:43,914 --> 00:07:45,943
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

189
00:07:45,944 --> 00:07:47,674
- Good luck.
- Bye.

190
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:50,974
- We could have asked for something.
- I know.

191
00:07:51,874 --> 00:07:54,013
Can't we take the
television from the lobby?

192
00:07:54,014 --> 00:07:55,713
- You can't.
- How many are they?

193
00:07:55,714 --> 00:07:57,943
There are five televisions here.

194
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,143
This is a treasure chest.

195
00:08:00,144 --> 00:08:02,343
Don't tell us off for taking everything.

196
00:08:02,344 --> 00:08:04,344
We might get everything from here.

197
00:08:05,074 --> 00:08:06,074
(They are emptying the
Running Man office first.)

198
00:08:06,075 --> 00:08:07,974
Can you open the door
with the entrance card?

199
00:08:08,274 --> 00:08:10,444
- Where is the Running Man team?
- It's here.

200
00:08:11,614 --> 00:08:14,243
- Look at this.
- It's a treasure chest.

201
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,513
- It's unbelievable.
- It's unbelievable.

202
00:08:16,514 --> 00:08:19,773
It looks like a stationery store.

203
00:08:19,774 --> 00:08:22,013
- It was a great choice coming here.
- I know.

204
00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:24,273
You are unbelievable. I didn't know.

205
00:08:24,274 --> 00:08:26,073
Here are the Running Balls.

206
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:27,243
(It's a paradise.)

207
00:08:27,244 --> 00:08:29,374
There is a stapler and a stamp.

208
00:08:29,444 --> 00:08:32,343
- They have everything.
- It's a stationery store.

209
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:35,844
- What is this?
- It's almost like...

210
00:08:36,014 --> 00:08:37,713
"Daiso".

211
00:08:37,714 --> 00:08:39,713
You didn't know, right?

212
00:08:39,714 --> 00:08:41,813
I didn't know this existed. Look at this.

213
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:43,774
- This is...
- Look at the thing outside the box.

214
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:46,713
I knew about the other things,

215
00:08:46,714 --> 00:08:48,414
but why would they need fertilizers?

216
00:08:50,074 --> 00:08:51,643
(Fertilizers are necessary for games!)

217
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:52,973
This is too much.

218
00:08:52,974 --> 00:08:56,443
- Fertilizers?
- Why would they have that?

219
00:08:56,444 --> 00:08:59,013
- This is unbelievable.
- It is.

220
00:08:59,014 --> 00:09:01,013
I thought I saw a
basketball stand somewhere.

221
00:09:01,014 --> 00:09:02,543
(Where is the basketball
stand and the dart board?)

222
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:05,074
Wait, I think they would have a dart board.

223
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:07,974
They don't have them.

224
00:09:08,444 --> 00:09:10,283
The things we need aren't here.

225
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:12,843
(They have fertilizers,
but not game utilities.)

226
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:13,973
(It's here somewhere.)

227
00:09:13,974 --> 00:09:15,574
- Where is the basketball stand?
- Hey.

228
00:09:15,614 --> 00:09:18,543
- What?
- Isn't this a basketball stand?

229
00:09:18,544 --> 00:09:21,343
(Seok Jin has a good feeling about this.)

230
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:23,214
- Gosh.
- It is, right?

231
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:24,474
Wait.

232
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:26,283
We got a basketball stand.

233
00:09:26,284 --> 00:09:29,073
(It looks somewhat strange.)

234
00:09:29,074 --> 00:09:31,143
We have a basketball stand.

235
00:09:31,144 --> 00:09:32,873
(It's really small, but it
is a basketball stand!)

236
00:09:32,874 --> 00:09:35,414
- Basketball stand.
- We got it.

237
00:09:35,514 --> 00:09:37,913
- Let's tell the others.
- We should.

238
00:09:37,914 --> 00:09:40,344
You found a basketball stand.

239
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,574
- You can spin the roulette.
- What is this?

240
00:09:42,674 --> 00:09:44,844
(What is this roulette for?)

241
00:09:44,874 --> 00:09:49,473
With the roulette, you can earn from
one dollar to an infinite check.

242
00:09:49,474 --> 00:09:53,144
We will give you the amount
selected by this roulette.

243
00:09:53,574 --> 00:09:55,284
- They'll even give us 100 dollars.
- This is amazing.

244
00:09:55,414 --> 00:09:57,544
- This is what we need.
- This is incredible.

245
00:09:58,074 --> 00:09:59,314
It says "100 dollars" and "1 dollar".

246
00:09:59,544 --> 00:10:01,343
- What is this "infinite check"?
- When you get an infinite check,

247
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:03,713
we will give you an item
you want free of charge.

248
00:10:03,714 --> 00:10:05,213
- Yes!
- This is splendid!

249
00:10:05,214 --> 00:10:07,474
Great job. This is a way
to do your job right.

250
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:10,514
To spin this... Wait. Are
you going to spin this?

251
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:13,473
- Let me practice once.
- Why are you spinning this?

252
00:10:13,474 --> 00:10:15,394
- Let me try this.
- Both of us should try once.

253
00:10:15,544 --> 00:10:19,514
(Jae Seok tests out the roulette
to evaluate his condition.)

254
00:10:20,574 --> 00:10:23,143
(He wins a dollar which is
the lowest amount of money.)

255
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:25,344
How could you get a dollar?

256
00:10:25,614 --> 00:10:28,514
He has to be the unluckiest guy.
He got a dollar.

257
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:31,444
- My hands are doomed.
- You should stay out of this.

258
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:32,813
I'm relieved this was a practice round.

259
00:10:32,814 --> 00:10:34,413
- You're practicing too, right?
- Yes.

260
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:36,174
(Seok Jin also tests out the roulette.)

261
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:37,884
I will get a better amount than you.

262
00:10:38,214 --> 00:10:41,644
(He's not so lucky either. He wins
a dollar just like Jae Seok.)

263
00:10:41,714 --> 00:10:42,814
It's a dollar.

264
00:10:43,044 --> 00:10:45,813
(They are the unluckiest.)

265
00:10:45,814 --> 00:10:46,913
Hey, then...

266
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:48,113
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

267
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,473
- The loser will spin it.
- Okay.

268
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:50,674
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

269
00:10:50,974 --> 00:10:52,644
(Jae Seok gets to spin it.)

270
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:53,943
Let go of my hand.

271
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,573
(He's nervous to let Jae Seok spin.)

272
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:57,814
You can't get a dollar.

273
00:10:58,244 --> 00:10:59,944
You have to win more than a dollar.

274
00:11:00,314 --> 00:11:02,844
I'd rather have a passer-by
spin this for us.

275
00:11:03,474 --> 00:11:04,814
Let's put this on here and spin.

276
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:06,744
Challenge!

277
00:11:07,914 --> 00:11:09,744
Watch me. I'll win an infinite check.

278
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:11,414
Winning 100 dollars will be enough.

279
00:11:11,644 --> 00:11:15,673
(A saying goes, if one's desperate,
things will go one's way.)

280
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:21,273
(Will Jae Seok be able
to pull off a miracle?)

281
00:11:21,274 --> 00:11:24,444
(There's no such miracle.
He wins a dollar.)

282
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:25,544
A dollar!

283
00:11:25,774 --> 00:11:28,014
(No way.)

284
00:11:29,414 --> 00:11:31,143
(He's consistent.)

285
00:11:31,144 --> 00:11:33,344
- How can you win only a dollar?
- Here is your dollar.

286
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:35,743
(His unlucky hands go at it again!)

287
00:11:35,744 --> 00:11:37,113
I can't believe this.

288
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,574
Your hands are so unlucky.

289
00:11:38,844 --> 00:11:42,643
- I can't believe you won a dollar.
- My goodness.

290
00:11:42,644 --> 00:11:44,474
(Meanwhile, where are other members?)

291
00:11:45,114 --> 00:11:46,714
(If they continue on this road,
they'll arrive at Itaewon.)

292
00:11:47,044 --> 00:11:49,914
If we pass by Itaewon, we
can meet Hong Suk Chun!

293
00:11:49,944 --> 00:11:51,444
Hong Suk Chun. Right. I met yesterday.

294
00:11:51,474 --> 00:11:53,074
He tends to be quite generous.

295
00:11:54,074 --> 00:11:55,074
Hello?

296
00:11:55,444 --> 00:11:57,173
- Suk Chun.
- What?

297
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,273
Were you sleeping?

298
00:11:58,274 --> 00:11:59,814
No. I'm in Itaewon.

299
00:12:02,544 --> 00:12:05,213
Suk Chun. We are filming Running Man.

300
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:08,713
You know how you are known to
be an angel without wings.

301
00:12:08,714 --> 00:12:11,874
- That's why Haha and I...
- Come here then.

302
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:13,713
- You're generous.
- You're our giving tree!

303
00:12:13,714 --> 00:12:16,174
We plan to visit you, the
wingless angel of Itaewon.

304
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:18,743
We are wondering if there
are things we could get.

305
00:12:18,744 --> 00:12:21,843
- Suk Chun.
- I'm glad to have you visit me.

306
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:24,113
- Then we'll head to your place.
- All right.

307
00:12:24,114 --> 00:12:26,244
- See you soon.
- Okay!

308
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:29,514
We are in Itaewon!

309
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:32,513
- It's nice to come on a sunny day.
- Right. On a sunny day,

310
00:12:32,514 --> 00:12:34,834
you can't just pass by Itaewon
without visiting this area.

311
00:12:36,744 --> 00:12:37,874
An outdoor table?

312
00:12:41,044 --> 00:12:44,314
(This is a place where they
can't hold in their freedom.)

313
00:12:48,744 --> 00:12:50,844
(Jong Kook, the movie actor)

314
00:12:51,974 --> 00:12:54,474
- You're good.
- Hey.

315
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,544
(They act silly out of excitement.)

316
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,243
See? This isn't weird.
No one is staring at us.

317
00:13:00,244 --> 00:13:02,743
Right? When we do this, - I feel free.

318
00:13:02,744 --> 00:13:04,844
No one considers our behavior strange.

319
00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:06,374
They're taking photos.

320
00:13:06,774 --> 00:13:09,344
(Their eyes meet with a citizen
inside the restaurant.)

321
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,773
(Out of nowhere, they start dancing.)

322
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:13,374
Look at this. Don't they look so free?

323
00:13:13,574 --> 00:13:15,643
- Freedom in Itaewon.
- "Freedom in Itaewon."

324
00:13:15,644 --> 00:13:18,444
Itaewon is a place of freedom.

325
00:13:19,244 --> 00:13:21,574
- It's a place of freedom.
- Yes, it is.

326
00:13:21,774 --> 00:13:22,774
We are the world.

327
00:13:23,514 --> 00:13:26,514
(They arrive at Suk Chun's place.)

328
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:28,914
Hello. Is Suk Chun here?

329
00:13:29,614 --> 00:13:31,244
I see. He's in the bathroom.

330
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,514
This is a nice, calm place.

331
00:13:33,744 --> 00:13:35,443
- I see a mirror ball.
- I see it too.

332
00:13:35,444 --> 00:13:37,574
(As soon as they step in,
they spot a mirror ball.)

333
00:13:37,744 --> 00:13:40,813
How could he have thought of
putting a mirror ball here?

334
00:13:40,814 --> 00:13:42,143
How nice.

335
00:13:42,144 --> 00:13:43,814
(There might be a lot of things
we could get from here.)

336
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:46,113
(He welcomes Suk Chun zealously.)

337
00:13:46,114 --> 00:13:47,713
Hong Suk Chun!

338
00:13:47,714 --> 00:13:49,143
- Stop it.
- Hong Suk Chun!

339
00:13:49,144 --> 00:13:51,343
(Suk Chun looks great even after
he comes back from the bathroom.)

340
00:13:51,344 --> 00:13:54,374
- Our generous angel, Hong Suk Chun!
- Our generous angel, Hong Suk Chun!

341
00:13:55,374 --> 00:13:57,013
- I knew it.
- We were passing by...

342
00:13:57,014 --> 00:13:59,143
- and thought of you.
- Why did you come to Itaewon?

343
00:13:59,144 --> 00:14:00,944
Look at your outfit. It's as
if you knew we were coming.

344
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,313
- No.
- He's always prepared.

345
00:14:03,314 --> 00:14:05,473
- He always dresses up nicely.
- I always look presentable.

346
00:14:05,474 --> 00:14:07,373
- My gosh.
- You're amazing.

347
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:10,073
Suk Chun. We are in a hurry.

348
00:14:10,074 --> 00:14:12,944
- Why are you in a hurry?
- We got a resting place.

349
00:14:13,114 --> 00:14:15,914
This is a list of furniture we need.

350
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:20,044
Take a look at this and see if there
is any furniture you can donate.

351
00:14:20,374 --> 00:14:21,873
If there is,

352
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:24,013
we can do its worth by working for you.

353
00:14:24,014 --> 00:14:25,914
We have the basketball stand.

354
00:14:26,674 --> 00:14:29,034
- We need a mirror ball...
- You need to get a mirror ball?

355
00:14:29,314 --> 00:14:30,943
- Yes.
- It's good if we have it.

356
00:14:30,944 --> 00:14:33,424
- I can see a mirror ball.
- I happened to spot a mirror ball.

357
00:14:33,814 --> 00:14:36,254
(There is a mirror ball in a
perfect place for them to take.)

358
00:14:36,314 --> 00:14:38,443
(You want to take my mirror ball?)

359
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,413
- I'm not trying to pressure you.
- No.

360
00:14:40,414 --> 00:14:42,174
- We didn't mean that.
- You don't have to give it to us.

361
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,413
- We were just mentioning it.
- There's no need to give it to us.

362
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:47,243
- You happened to have it.
- There are smaller ones.

363
00:14:47,244 --> 00:14:48,884
We'll have to get it from somewhere else.

364
00:14:48,914 --> 00:14:50,573
Are you here to steal from me?

365
00:14:50,574 --> 00:14:52,243
- No, we are not here to steal.
- That's not it.

366
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:54,613
You can ask us to do something for
you in exchange for these things.

367
00:14:54,614 --> 00:14:56,374
- You will?
- We'll do something.

368
00:14:57,274 --> 00:14:59,143
- We'll do it for you.
- Really?

369
00:14:59,144 --> 00:15:01,274
Then both of you will...

370
00:15:02,544 --> 00:15:03,674
Come on, Suk Chun.

371
00:15:05,144 --> 00:15:07,413
What? Hold on.

372
00:15:07,414 --> 00:15:09,174
- You two overestimated yourselves.
- We are?

373
00:15:09,214 --> 00:15:10,343
I only said,

374
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:13,513
- "Then both of you will..."
- What were you going to say?

375
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:16,744
- I was going to ask you to clean.
- To clean? I see.

376
00:15:16,844 --> 00:15:18,243
- I'm sorry.
- What were you thinking?

377
00:15:18,244 --> 00:15:20,743
- I'm sorry.
- That was the funny part.

378
00:15:20,744 --> 00:15:22,213
You two are unbelievable.

379
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:23,773
- We're sorry.
- I'm not like that.

380
00:15:23,774 --> 00:15:25,243
We can definitely clean for you.

381
00:15:25,244 --> 00:15:26,944
Besides, you're the last
person I'd think about.

382
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:29,344
(He speaks bluntly to Haha.)

383
00:15:30,344 --> 00:15:32,744
I know your wife.

384
00:15:33,514 --> 00:15:36,243
All right. Then do you want a desk?

385
00:15:36,244 --> 00:15:38,414
- Or do you want a mirror ball?
- Okay.

386
00:15:39,074 --> 00:15:41,644
- I mean...
- I'd like to give you everything.

387
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:45,213
I just got goosebumps. When
you starred on our show,

388
00:15:45,214 --> 00:15:47,414
- we were on the same team.
- Were we?

389
00:15:47,844 --> 00:15:50,344
- I think we were. Yes, we were.
- We were on the same team.

390
00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:53,174
(Running Man, Episode 206)

391
00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:59,474
(Their teamwork was fantastic
and they won the race.)

392
00:15:59,844 --> 00:16:01,443
- Yes, we were.
- Suk Chun.

393
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:02,974
We were a team.

394
00:16:03,114 --> 00:16:05,243
- Suk Chun.
- Right. We were family.

395
00:16:05,244 --> 00:16:06,743
Then give us a sofa.

396
00:16:06,744 --> 00:16:08,714
(We are family, aren't we?)

397
00:16:08,774 --> 00:16:12,174
(Family members share everything.)

398
00:16:12,944 --> 00:16:14,914
Oh, right. It turns out that...

399
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,843
- I have a sofa I'm not using.
- Really?

400
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,273
Don't you have a lot of refrigerators?

401
00:16:19,274 --> 00:16:20,774
(You own a lot of restaurants.)

402
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:22,873
(Can't you give your
family a refrigerator?)

403
00:16:22,874 --> 00:16:24,444
Hold on.

404
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:25,973
Family is...

405
00:16:25,974 --> 00:16:28,374
Family is such a burden!

406
00:16:29,574 --> 00:16:30,873
(They obtain a microwave
and a mirror ball.)

407
00:16:30,874 --> 00:16:32,213
I can't even swear at you guys.

408
00:16:32,214 --> 00:16:35,443
(Nothing is free in life.
It's time for them to work.)

409
00:16:35,444 --> 00:16:38,144
- We are very thankful.
- A microwave and a mirror ball.

410
00:16:38,614 --> 00:16:41,614
- How many dirty dishes do we have?
- Give me the dishes.

411
00:16:41,644 --> 00:16:43,714
- You can give everything to him.
- Please give them to me.

412
00:16:43,974 --> 00:16:45,743
- He's going to wash them.
- Of course.

413
00:16:45,744 --> 00:16:47,704
- He'll clean them nicely.
- I like doing dishes.

414
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,273
- Bring them.
- I like cleaning dishes.

415
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,913
Give him anything that has
to be washed and cleaned.

416
00:16:51,914 --> 00:16:53,214
(He starts washing dishes.)

417
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:55,614
- Look at this.
- What is it?

418
00:16:57,074 --> 00:16:58,943
- It's still greasy.
- Really?

419
00:16:58,944 --> 00:17:00,414
- Do it again!
- Are you certain?

420
00:17:01,614 --> 00:17:02,874
It can't be.

421
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:06,173
- You'd better wash them well.
- My goodness.

422
00:17:06,174 --> 00:17:07,313
(Sloppy)

423
00:17:07,314 --> 00:17:09,843
You don't seem to be
good at washing dishes.

424
00:17:09,844 --> 00:17:14,044
You only used those hands of yours
to lift weights. They're sloppy.

425
00:17:14,484 --> 00:17:16,073
You need to be thorough with every dish.

426
00:17:16,074 --> 00:17:17,954
(My boss seems to be strict.
I will work hard.)

427
00:17:18,044 --> 00:17:21,744
I hire part-timers for their looks.

428
00:17:22,484 --> 00:17:23,713
Look at you.

429
00:17:23,714 --> 00:17:25,574
You are definitely in charge of cleaning.

430
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:28,074
(It was really Haha.)

431
00:17:28,374 --> 00:17:29,573
Oh, my.

432
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:32,444
- He's a part-timer.
- Right, I am.

433
00:17:32,944 --> 00:17:35,674
I really thought you were
a part-timer at first.

434
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:37,273
- You're Haha.
- Yes, I am.

435
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:39,573
(He smiles like an angle since
he's in front of a customer.)

436
00:17:39,574 --> 00:17:42,014
By the way, both of you are good-looking.

437
00:17:42,214 --> 00:17:44,014
I will give you something.
It's on the house.

438
00:17:44,674 --> 00:17:48,443
You have no right to do that.
Don't you know how much you earn?

439
00:17:48,444 --> 00:17:50,244
(Where did that angel go?)

440
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:52,813
In 1, 2, 3.

441
00:17:52,814 --> 00:17:54,274
(Taking photos with
customers is their duty.)

442
00:17:54,484 --> 00:17:56,843
- You are one lucky lady.
- You're right.

443
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:58,244
- Thank you.
- I'm a fan.

444
00:17:58,414 --> 00:17:59,414
Suk Chun.

445
00:17:59,874 --> 00:18:01,074
- Gosh.
- By the way,

446
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:03,143
- this is a bit dirty.
- It doesn't matter.

447
00:18:03,144 --> 00:18:04,843
- Clean it before using it.
- This is a used microwave.

448
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:07,484
Where would we have gotten this?

449
00:18:07,644 --> 00:18:08,773
Here is the mirror ball.

450
00:18:08,774 --> 00:18:11,213
- I have memories with this.
- I see.

451
00:18:11,214 --> 00:18:12,714
- Use it well.
- Of course.

452
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:15,344
- We appreciate it.
- Thank you. We'll use it well.

453
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:18,244
- It's only possible in Running Man.
- I can't thank you enough.

454
00:18:18,374 --> 00:18:21,113
- Suk Chun should spin this.
- Me?

455
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:22,213
- Don't worry.
- I'm not very good at this.

456
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:24,144
- I don't get lucky.
- That's fine.

457
00:18:24,274 --> 00:18:25,613
What am I going to do?

458
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:27,513
You never know. This isn't for you.

459
00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:29,143
- You can spin it twice.
- Really?

460
00:18:29,144 --> 00:18:31,173
- Spin it from here.
- All right.

461
00:18:31,174 --> 00:18:32,213
Hold this.

462
00:18:32,214 --> 00:18:33,943
- Don't practice.
- Let me practice.

463
00:18:33,944 --> 00:18:36,744
- You can spin it twice. Do it.
- Win an infinite check.

464
00:18:37,014 --> 00:18:38,313
- Do it now?
- Do it.

465
00:18:38,314 --> 00:18:40,113
You are our generous angel.
The universe will help you.

466
00:18:40,114 --> 00:18:41,273
- Let's do this.
- Let's go.

467
00:18:41,274 --> 00:18:42,713
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Give it a good spin.

468
00:18:42,714 --> 00:18:44,344
(Right, I am an angel.)

469
00:18:44,714 --> 00:18:50,044
(Suk Chun. You always share. You
were busy taking care of us, right?)

470
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:55,574
(The universe won't turn its back
on you and your good deeds.)

471
00:18:57,444 --> 00:19:00,113
(He wins a dollar!)

472
00:19:00,114 --> 00:19:01,674
- I said I shouldn't do it.
- That's all right.

473
00:19:01,844 --> 00:19:03,274
- I said I should practice.
- Don't worry.

474
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:05,573
- Why are you doing this to me?
- It's okay.

475
00:19:05,574 --> 00:19:07,243
- You'll get lucky now.
- This is all right.

476
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:08,873
- Win us 100 dollars.
- Let's win 100 dollars.

477
00:19:08,874 --> 00:19:10,484
- It's on the roulette?
- Yes, it is.

478
00:19:10,644 --> 00:19:11,773
- Spin it.
- Here it goes.

479
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:13,644
(He's hesitant.)

480
00:19:14,644 --> 00:19:20,484
(We're grateful for the items, but
we hope we can thank you even more.)

481
00:19:21,144 --> 00:19:25,744
(What will generous Suk Chun
win at his second try?)

482
00:19:26,674 --> 00:19:29,374
(He wins a dollar again.)

483
00:19:30,484 --> 00:19:32,143
(He's a man who only wins a dollar.)

484
00:19:32,144 --> 00:19:33,643
How could he get a dollar again?

485
00:19:33,644 --> 00:19:35,143
(He's a man who only wins a dollar.)

486
00:19:35,144 --> 00:19:37,144
How can he win a dollar twice in a row?

487
00:19:37,714 --> 00:19:38,873
He could have won 10 dollars.

488
00:19:38,874 --> 00:19:40,613
(I'm sorry.)

489
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:41,744
Goodness.

490
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,344
Two dollars are nothing.

491
00:19:43,484 --> 00:19:45,573
I told you I'm unlucky.

492
00:19:45,574 --> 00:19:46,913
You're right.

493
00:19:46,914 --> 00:19:48,774
(Where's Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo?)

494
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:51,414
- Can we accept things?
- Yes.

495
00:19:52,314 --> 00:19:54,713
- Whom are you calling?
- I'm calling my brother.

496
00:19:54,714 --> 00:19:56,614
- Sung Moon is...
- Is he at home?

497
00:19:56,814 --> 00:19:59,414
We can ask favors from him, right?

498
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,054
- Right, he's your family.
- However,

499
00:20:01,314 --> 00:20:03,214
he usually doesn't answer my calls.

500
00:20:03,314 --> 00:20:05,374
- I'll call him.
- Wait.

501
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:07,314
Let me call him first.

502
00:20:09,314 --> 00:20:10,714
Where are you?

503
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:13,173
- I'm at home.
- That's good.

504
00:20:13,174 --> 00:20:15,414
- I'm recording Running Man.
- Hello, this is Kwang Soo.

505
00:20:15,844 --> 00:20:18,944
- Hello, Kwang Soo.
- Your voice suddenly changed.

506
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:23,614
- We're coming to the house.
- Is it close to here?

507
00:20:23,714 --> 00:20:26,574
Do you know the table I use
when I read my scripts?

508
00:20:28,174 --> 00:20:34,143
(Actresses have a special
table for reading scripts.)

509
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:35,174
Which one?

510
00:20:35,744 --> 00:20:36,774
Which one?

511
00:20:37,074 --> 00:20:38,513
"Which one?"
- He doesn't know.

512
00:20:38,514 --> 00:20:41,774
- Go and wash your face.
- Bring the table outside.

513
00:20:42,314 --> 00:20:44,874
- Why?
- Wash your face for now.

514
00:20:45,174 --> 00:20:46,414
- Okay.
- Okay.

515
00:20:46,944 --> 00:20:48,573
- Let's go to the house.
- To Sung Moon?

516
00:20:48,574 --> 00:20:49,844
(They head to Ji Hyo's house.)

517
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,013
(They arrive to meet her brother.)

518
00:20:53,014 --> 00:20:54,843
It'd be perfect if we can take that chair.

519
00:20:54,844 --> 00:20:57,113
Gosh, those would be perfect.

520
00:20:57,114 --> 00:20:58,843
(It's a nice table and chair set.)

521
00:20:58,844 --> 00:21:01,484
- I'll call Sung Moon.
- I want to steal them.

522
00:21:02,914 --> 00:21:04,773
- I have an urge to steal.
- No way.

523
00:21:04,774 --> 00:21:06,713
- I want to run away with it.
- I'm regular here.

524
00:21:06,714 --> 00:21:08,114
(He has a sudden urge.)

525
00:21:09,844 --> 00:21:12,114
- Sung Moon is coming.
- Is he here already?

526
00:21:13,714 --> 00:21:15,044
What's wrong with him?

527
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:18,213
(He delivers a table for reading scripts.)

528
00:21:18,214 --> 00:21:19,374
He looks embarrassing.

529
00:21:19,574 --> 00:21:21,574
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

530
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:24,414
Does he know he's on camera?
Come to senses, Sung Moon.

531
00:21:24,744 --> 00:21:27,444
- Isn't that good?
- The table looks good.

532
00:21:27,714 --> 00:21:30,314
- Isn't that good?
- The table looks good.

533
00:21:31,344 --> 00:21:34,413
Have you been well? Thank you.
Did you just get up?

534
00:21:34,414 --> 00:21:37,744
- This is a great table.
- It's a table.

535
00:21:37,814 --> 00:21:39,314
Let's use it.

536
00:21:39,514 --> 00:21:41,213
This is good enough.

537
00:21:41,214 --> 00:21:42,744
Do you usually use this table?

538
00:21:43,114 --> 00:21:45,514
No, Ji Hyo uses it when she drinks beer.

539
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:48,074
Ji Hyo uses it when she drinks beer.

540
00:21:48,844 --> 00:21:51,743
She said something different on the phone.

541
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,613
- She said it's for reading scripts.
- I read scripts at this table.

542
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:57,173
- That's once in 10 times.
- She uses it once out of 10 times.

543
00:21:57,174 --> 00:22:00,944
Mostly, she uses it for drinking
beer before going to bed.

544
00:22:01,114 --> 00:22:03,274
You can't simply take this table.

545
00:22:03,674 --> 00:22:06,844
You must do a favor of
the person who owns it.

546
00:22:06,874 --> 00:22:09,943
- I own this table.
- Don't say that.

547
00:22:09,944 --> 00:22:11,774
- The table is Sung Moon's.
- Right.

548
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:15,144
It's Sung Moon's. Is
there anything you want?

549
00:22:15,374 --> 00:22:18,074
(He whispers.)

550
00:22:19,314 --> 00:22:21,914
(Are you sure that's what you want?)

551
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:25,644
Sung Moon wants to hit Ji Hyo.

552
00:22:26,014 --> 00:22:27,774
He wants to hit Ji Hyo.

553
00:22:27,974 --> 00:22:30,544
She always hits him, but he
never gets to hit her back.

554
00:22:30,574 --> 00:22:34,174
He'd like to hit her lightly with care.

555
00:22:34,944 --> 00:22:36,314
- Okay.
- Okay?

556
00:22:37,344 --> 00:22:41,273
(You won't hit me hard, will you?)

557
00:22:41,274 --> 00:22:43,314
(That was a lie.)

558
00:22:43,474 --> 00:22:46,074
- In 3, 2, 1.
- Look at his pose.

559
00:22:46,374 --> 00:22:49,713
(He gets into a position to hit her.)

560
00:22:49,714 --> 00:22:50,714
- Sung Moon.
- What?

561
00:22:50,715 --> 00:22:53,113
You look like you're ready
to kick a soccer ball.

562
00:22:53,114 --> 00:22:55,614
- I thought you were Ronaldo.
- Okay.

563
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,173
In 3, 2, 1.

564
00:22:58,174 --> 00:22:59,974
(He's ready to take revenge.)

565
00:23:00,314 --> 00:23:03,913
(He kicks hard.)

566
00:23:03,914 --> 00:23:06,344
(She feels extreme pain.)

567
00:23:07,114 --> 00:23:08,614
Where did he go?

568
00:23:09,144 --> 00:23:10,643
(Love is deep between siblings.)

569
00:23:10,644 --> 00:23:11,944
It really hurts.

570
00:23:13,414 --> 00:23:14,674
(Punching)

571
00:23:14,844 --> 00:23:18,643
Your brother kicked you.
I don't deserve this.

572
00:23:18,644 --> 00:23:20,374
You encouraged him.

573
00:23:20,674 --> 00:23:23,214
- That really hurt.
- Thank you anyway.

574
00:23:23,714 --> 00:23:24,873
Thank you.

575
00:23:24,874 --> 00:23:26,173
(They obtain a table.)

576
00:23:26,174 --> 00:23:28,913
When you obtain an item,
you may spin the roulette.

577
00:23:28,914 --> 00:23:30,843
Here's the roulette.

578
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:33,544
- Don't do it. Here, Sung Moon.
- Sung Moon should do it.

579
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:35,544
I'm unlucky like you.

580
00:23:35,644 --> 00:23:36,873
- Try it, Sung Moon.
- Try it.

581
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,213
You have good energy.

582
00:23:38,214 --> 00:23:39,914
In 1, 2, 3.

583
00:23:40,074 --> 00:23:41,713
In 1, 2, 3.

584
00:23:41,714 --> 00:23:45,674
(Will Sung Moon get lucky?)

585
00:23:46,444 --> 00:23:49,114
(It's one dollar.)

586
00:23:49,374 --> 00:23:52,943
(How dare you after kicking your sister?)

587
00:23:52,944 --> 00:23:55,643
(I'm sorry.)

588
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:58,773
(They obtain a table and a dollar.)

589
00:23:58,774 --> 00:24:00,814
- See you.
- Bye, Sung Moon.

590
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:02,414
Thank you. Bye.

591
00:24:02,844 --> 00:24:04,643
Let's make another call.

592
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:06,873
(What's the next item?)

593
00:24:06,874 --> 00:24:08,374
Lee Dong Wook isn't answering.

594
00:24:08,444 --> 00:24:10,043
Lee Dong Wook isn't answering.

595
00:24:10,044 --> 00:24:11,973
(Is it who I think he is?)

596
00:24:11,974 --> 00:24:17,044
(Lee Dong Wook, the best-looking man
in afterlife, is a popular actor.)

597
00:24:17,814 --> 00:24:19,574
Lee Dong Wook isn't answering.

598
00:24:19,814 --> 00:24:21,774
- Hello?
- Where are you?

599
00:24:22,414 --> 00:24:25,674
- I'm at a film shoot.
- When will you finish?

600
00:24:25,914 --> 00:24:27,413
I'll finish around 9pm.

601
00:24:27,414 --> 00:24:29,074
Listen to me carefully.

602
00:24:29,244 --> 00:24:31,044
- Listen carefully?
- Bidet...

603
00:24:31,314 --> 00:24:33,474
- Bidet?
- And a mirror ball.

604
00:24:33,814 --> 00:24:34,814
A mirror ball.

605
00:24:34,815 --> 00:24:38,643
(She recites the list of items.)

606
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:41,243
(What is she talking about?)

607
00:24:41,244 --> 00:24:43,443
- Claw crane.
- Claw crane.

608
00:24:43,444 --> 00:24:45,673
- Parasol.
- Parasol.

609
00:24:45,674 --> 00:24:46,844
Barbecue grill.

610
00:24:48,114 --> 00:24:49,473
Are you teaching me Korean now?

611
00:24:49,474 --> 00:24:52,014
No, that's not it.

612
00:24:52,274 --> 00:24:54,843
- Among these items...
- Should I repeat after you?

613
00:24:54,844 --> 00:24:56,613
- No.
- No, we're sorry.

614
00:24:56,614 --> 00:24:59,874
Is there an item you can
give me as you don't use it?

615
00:25:00,174 --> 00:25:02,143
- Claw crane.
- Do you have a claw crane?

616
00:25:02,144 --> 00:25:04,873
(That's a difficult item to find.)

617
00:25:04,874 --> 00:25:06,513
- What?
- Do you have a claw crane?

618
00:25:06,514 --> 00:25:07,973
Do you mean something I have?

619
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:10,013
- What are you doing?
- Are you joking?

620
00:25:10,014 --> 00:25:14,244
We have to obtain these items.

621
00:25:14,744 --> 00:25:16,474
How can I give it to you?

622
00:25:16,944 --> 00:25:19,143
Tell me. I'll take it from your house.

623
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:23,014
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry, Dong Wook.

624
00:25:23,044 --> 00:25:24,114
(Hey, you jerks.)

625
00:25:24,144 --> 00:25:27,444
I'm sorry. It's because we're in a hurry.

626
00:25:27,514 --> 00:25:29,074
- Dong Wook.
- We're really in a hurry.

627
00:25:29,614 --> 00:25:31,614
I really enjoyed your drama.

628
00:25:33,314 --> 00:25:34,473
It came out of nowhere.

629
00:25:34,474 --> 00:25:35,713
We should hang up.

630
00:25:35,714 --> 00:25:37,373
- Okay.
- What's going on?

631
00:25:37,374 --> 00:25:38,513
I'm sorry.

632
00:25:38,514 --> 00:25:40,143
- If you think of something,
- We should hang up.

633
00:25:40,144 --> 00:25:42,374
Please call me.

634
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,973
Are you hanging up because
you don't need me?

635
00:25:44,974 --> 00:25:47,444
- That's not why.
- Hey.

636
00:25:47,744 --> 00:25:49,543
- Call me if you think of something.
- We'll call you again.

637
00:25:49,544 --> 00:25:51,614
Call me if you have an item.

638
00:25:51,814 --> 00:25:52,814
Okay.

639
00:25:52,815 --> 00:25:54,873
- Thank you.
- Good luck, Dong Wook.

640
00:25:54,874 --> 00:25:56,344
- Have a good day.
- Bye.

641
00:25:57,114 --> 00:25:58,874
I'll call Park Jung Min.

642
00:25:59,144 --> 00:26:01,014
- Is he nearby?
- He's moving.

643
00:26:01,074 --> 00:26:02,914
- Is he moving?
- He's moving two days later.

644
00:26:03,244 --> 00:26:05,484
- That sounds good.
- Jung Min is moving two days later.

645
00:26:05,514 --> 00:26:07,474
(Give us things you don't need.)

646
00:26:07,814 --> 00:26:09,314
- Hello.
- Where are you?

647
00:26:10,014 --> 00:26:12,134
- I'm in Samcheong-dong.
- Do you have a mirror ball?

648
00:26:12,444 --> 00:26:15,074
- Why would I have it?
- You don't have it?

649
00:26:15,344 --> 00:26:18,813
- I have things at home.
- When will you go back home?

650
00:26:18,814 --> 00:26:20,314
I'm going home at night.

651
00:26:21,214 --> 00:26:23,044
I'll come to you. Let's talk in person.

652
00:26:23,244 --> 00:26:25,314
You can come, but I can only...

653
00:26:25,414 --> 00:26:29,114
- take a 10-minute break.
- Of course I know.

654
00:26:29,344 --> 00:26:31,243
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

655
00:26:31,244 --> 00:26:34,544
(They head to Samcheong-dong
for possible items.)

656
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,174
- Is this the place?
- Yes.

657
00:26:38,144 --> 00:26:40,943
(We're here for your donations.)

658
00:26:40,944 --> 00:26:42,274
He and I look similar.

659
00:26:42,374 --> 00:26:44,043
He looks similar to Seok Jin.

660
00:26:44,044 --> 00:26:46,113
- He really does.
- The door is open.

661
00:26:46,114 --> 00:26:47,214
Okay.

662
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,754
- How do we open it?
- I don't know.

663
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:50,114
The door is open.

664
00:26:52,314 --> 00:26:53,443
Hello.

665
00:26:53,444 --> 00:26:55,744
(Jo Woo Jong)

666
00:26:55,844 --> 00:26:58,344
- Hello, congratulations.
- Is this the apartment?

667
00:26:58,374 --> 00:27:00,243
(He's getting married on March.)

668
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,914
Congratulations. When is your wedding?

669
00:27:02,074 --> 00:27:03,774
- It's on the 16th.
- I see.

670
00:27:03,974 --> 00:27:06,344
Are you getting along at work?

671
00:27:07,014 --> 00:27:10,044
He told me to stay at home,

672
00:27:10,444 --> 00:27:12,314
- so I'm at home every day.
- That's good.

673
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:14,643
- Come on. You work a lot.
- By the way,

674
00:27:14,644 --> 00:27:18,014
- you're getting married suddenly.
- Right.

675
00:27:18,574 --> 00:27:20,414
Are you here to interview me?

676
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:23,343
- No, I'm not.
- Weren't you a reporter?

677
00:27:23,344 --> 00:27:24,743
- Right.
- I was too.

678
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:27,513
We were reporters on
"Entertainment Weekly".

679
00:27:27,514 --> 00:27:28,813
- That's true.
- I worked there too.

680
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,913
All of us are former reporters
on "Entertainment Weekly".

681
00:27:30,914 --> 00:27:32,714
- That's right.
- We're coworkers.

682
00:27:32,914 --> 00:27:34,973
- We were on that show.
- I was a reporter...

683
00:27:34,974 --> 00:27:37,414
on "Entertainment Weekly", and I got fired.

684
00:27:37,844 --> 00:27:40,613
- He was a reporter at that time.
- Right.

685
00:27:40,614 --> 00:27:42,313
- Soon after, I got fired.
- I remember.

686
00:27:42,314 --> 00:27:43,674
You were fired next.

687
00:27:44,074 --> 00:27:45,974
- Woo Jong was...
- I was a reporter,

688
00:27:46,074 --> 00:27:48,244
- but then I got fired.
- Were you?

689
00:27:48,914 --> 00:27:52,473
Woo Jong seems to get fired
often from TV shows.

690
00:27:52,474 --> 00:27:54,613
(Woo Jong had forgotten his past.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

691
00:27:54,614 --> 00:27:56,014
That's what I noticed.

692
00:27:56,144 --> 00:27:58,574
Thank you, Woo Jong.

693
00:27:59,214 --> 00:28:00,973
- For what?
- I'm just thankful.

694
00:28:00,974 --> 00:28:02,773
- Seriously.
- I haven't done anything.

695
00:28:02,774 --> 00:28:05,813
Shall we take a look at your house?

696
00:28:05,814 --> 00:28:06,974
Let's see.

697
00:28:07,344 --> 00:28:10,743
(They start to take a look at the house.)

698
00:28:10,744 --> 00:28:11,773
Wait a minute.

699
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:14,543
- I'm not married yet. I need them.
- Don't worry. I know.

700
00:28:14,544 --> 00:28:15,843
You'll be next week.

701
00:28:15,844 --> 00:28:18,644
- Let me take a look.
- I need it for cooking.

702
00:28:19,174 --> 00:28:21,844
We won't take it. We can't.

703
00:28:22,414 --> 00:28:24,943
- May I get a drink?
- This isn't new.

704
00:28:24,944 --> 00:28:27,343
- Do you have food?
- I bought a used fridge.

705
00:28:27,344 --> 00:28:28,843
I bought it for 600 dollars.

706
00:28:28,844 --> 00:28:29,944
Is it a used fridge?

707
00:28:30,514 --> 00:28:32,814
- This is great.
- It works well.

708
00:28:32,874 --> 00:28:35,244
Even if it works well,

709
00:28:35,444 --> 00:28:38,713
it's still a used fridge.

710
00:28:38,714 --> 00:28:42,443
A new fridge might be better
since you're getting married.

711
00:28:42,444 --> 00:28:45,743
I have a question. I've been living here,

712
00:28:45,744 --> 00:28:47,914
so using an old fridge doesn't matter.

713
00:28:47,974 --> 00:28:49,713
- My wife may feel differently.
- She'd like a new one.

714
00:28:49,714 --> 00:28:51,974
- Right.
- You know that sofa?

715
00:28:52,074 --> 00:28:54,613
- Your wife might want a new one.
- She keeps talking about it.

716
00:28:54,614 --> 00:28:56,714
- Of course.
- This is why.

717
00:28:56,774 --> 00:28:59,744
- She may want new furniture.
- Come here. My goodness.

718
00:28:59,844 --> 00:29:02,314
- It may be okay for you.
- Is it true?

719
00:29:02,744 --> 00:29:04,713
- Are you trying to take it?
- No.

720
00:29:04,714 --> 00:29:06,914
- Listen to me carefully.
- Listen.

721
00:29:07,514 --> 00:29:08,774
You should sit here.

722
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:12,314
I thought Seok Jin was Woo Jong.

723
00:29:13,114 --> 00:29:15,013
It doesn't matter where we sit.

724
00:29:15,014 --> 00:29:16,573
- It's hard to differentiate.
- It's confusing.

725
00:29:16,574 --> 00:29:18,813
- It's hard to differentiate.
- You have to look carefully.

726
00:29:18,814 --> 00:29:22,714
Your wife may feel this way.

727
00:29:22,774 --> 00:29:24,974
- It's her one and only marriage.
- Look.

728
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:28,714
- Not because she doesn't like it.
- It's not because it's old.

729
00:29:28,814 --> 00:29:30,574
It's you and her apartment.

730
00:29:30,814 --> 00:29:33,544
These things are yours.

731
00:29:33,744 --> 00:29:37,614
To decorate it as a new apartment,

732
00:29:37,774 --> 00:29:39,513
you should get rid of the used ones.

733
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:42,514
It's fun to fill the house
with more furniture.

734
00:29:42,674 --> 00:29:44,773
That's true, but the bride
might not think so.

735
00:29:44,774 --> 00:29:46,274
That's right.

736
00:29:46,714 --> 00:29:48,344
- Woo Jong.
- Yes.

737
00:29:48,774 --> 00:29:50,474
Are we taking that television?

738
00:29:50,674 --> 00:29:53,673
Pardon? That's the only television I have.

739
00:29:53,674 --> 00:29:55,843
- I know.
- You're planning...

740
00:29:55,844 --> 00:29:57,873
to get a new one, right?

741
00:29:57,874 --> 00:29:59,673
It's a nice television. It's too nice.

742
00:29:59,674 --> 00:30:01,314
It's even nicer than mine.

743
00:30:01,474 --> 00:30:04,744
Are you going to... Right now... I see.

744
00:30:05,374 --> 00:30:09,073
- We are.
- I have around 10 days until...

745
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:11,843
- my wedding. I like watching TV.
- I see.

746
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:14,043
- Is there anything else you want?
- We...

747
00:30:14,044 --> 00:30:16,373
There's nothing else.

748
00:30:16,374 --> 00:30:17,674
(He doesn't sound happy.)

749
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,174
(We really like your TV, Woo Jong.)

750
00:30:21,414 --> 00:30:23,443
- No, it's okay.
- Is that the only thing you want?

751
00:30:23,444 --> 00:30:25,873
- That's not it.
- Do you have a gas burner?

752
00:30:25,874 --> 00:30:28,514
- Do you have it, by any chance?
- A gas burner?

753
00:30:28,774 --> 00:30:30,414
I do.

754
00:30:32,074 --> 00:30:33,773
I have it.

755
00:30:33,774 --> 00:30:36,073
- I don't even use it.
- That's it!

756
00:30:36,074 --> 00:30:37,373
(They finally agree.)

757
00:30:37,374 --> 00:30:39,043
It worked out.

758
00:30:39,044 --> 00:30:40,713
- I have it.
- That's good.

759
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,073
- I was planning to give it away.
- That's perfect.

760
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,473
- I have it.
- That's great.

761
00:30:45,474 --> 00:30:48,473
I'm happy that he's giving it up so easily.

762
00:30:48,474 --> 00:30:51,213
People have it at home,
but they hardly use it.

763
00:30:51,214 --> 00:30:53,673
Same goes for me. I have
one, but I don't use it.

764
00:30:53,674 --> 00:30:56,513
You only use it when you go camping.

765
00:30:56,514 --> 00:30:58,243
That's right.

766
00:30:58,244 --> 00:31:00,773
- Woo Jong.
- I didn't know what to do with it.

767
00:31:00,774 --> 00:31:02,513
- It's nice.
- Woo Jong.

768
00:31:02,514 --> 00:31:04,873
You hardly used it.

769
00:31:04,874 --> 00:31:06,673
Do you need anything else?

770
00:31:06,674 --> 00:31:08,943
- Do you need rugs?
- We do.

771
00:31:08,944 --> 00:31:10,443
- Do you have it?
- Of course, I do.

772
00:31:10,444 --> 00:31:12,513
(I have rugs.)

773
00:31:12,514 --> 00:31:15,613
- I don't use them. I have them.
- That's great.

774
00:31:15,614 --> 00:31:18,714
You only wrote down what I don't need.

775
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:21,243
That's amazing. How can you have rugs?

776
00:31:21,244 --> 00:31:23,613
- You don't use it?
- I have so many.

777
00:31:23,614 --> 00:31:24,644
This?

778
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:27,874
- We only need one.
- I have...

779
00:31:28,474 --> 00:31:29,973
- so many.
- This is awesome.

780
00:31:29,974 --> 00:31:31,773
This is awesome.

781
00:31:31,774 --> 00:31:34,313
- Keep the rest. This is enough.
- I have more.

782
00:31:34,314 --> 00:31:37,273
- These rugs.
- Woo Jong's house...

783
00:31:37,274 --> 00:31:40,174
- is great.
- We got a lot.

784
00:31:40,244 --> 00:31:42,673
If you need something, you
have to visit newlyweds.

785
00:31:42,674 --> 00:31:44,314
- Yes.
- You're right.

786
00:31:44,374 --> 00:31:46,973
Do you need anything from them, Woo Jong?

787
00:31:46,974 --> 00:31:49,314
Do I need anything? Would
they grant anything?

788
00:31:49,444 --> 00:31:50,873
Tell us.

789
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:53,543
- Me?
- What if Running Man members...

790
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:57,413
Then... - create a video message for you?

791
00:31:57,414 --> 00:31:59,644
- We can do that.
- That's too easy.

792
00:31:59,674 --> 00:32:01,843
- A video message?
- I'm sorry to say this,

793
00:32:01,844 --> 00:32:05,343
That's too easy.
But he's a celebrity as well.

794
00:32:05,344 --> 00:32:07,573
What is he saying?

795
00:32:07,574 --> 00:32:09,973
- It'll help.
- He thinks he's so important.

796
00:32:09,974 --> 00:32:12,443
It'll only help if you're a non-celebrity.

797
00:32:12,444 --> 00:32:15,713
- It doesn't help me.
- He's a celebrity himself.

798
00:32:15,714 --> 00:32:18,443
- Tell me if you need it.
- Are you really doing that?

799
00:32:18,444 --> 00:32:19,444
Sorry?

800
00:32:20,614 --> 00:32:22,673
- I need a humidifier.
- That's perfect.

801
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,043
- We can get it for him.
- Let's do that.

802
00:32:24,044 --> 00:32:26,273
- It's not too much, right?
- No way.

803
00:32:26,274 --> 00:32:28,513
That's great.

804
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:31,173
- That's not difficult.
- We'll get you a humidifier...

805
00:32:31,174 --> 00:32:33,573
to put in your couple's room.

806
00:32:33,574 --> 00:32:36,674
It'll be filled with love.

807
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:40,573
- Thank you.
- You have gained your items.

808
00:32:40,574 --> 00:32:42,713
- Do we spin it again?
- My gosh.

809
00:32:42,714 --> 00:32:44,373
- Let me spin it this time.
- All right.

810
00:32:44,374 --> 00:32:46,443
He got a dollar last time.

811
00:32:46,444 --> 00:32:48,574
- Let me try it.
- Go ahead.

812
00:32:50,674 --> 00:32:52,313
I hope we get 100 dollars.

813
00:32:52,314 --> 00:32:53,874
(Is he lucky or unlucky?)

814
00:32:54,444 --> 00:32:55,773
Look at that.

815
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:57,713
- You should do it.
- I'm good at things like this.

816
00:32:57,714 --> 00:32:59,843
- Should I do it?
- You do it.

817
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,673
- You have to say, "Go."
- Say it.

818
00:33:01,674 --> 00:33:03,874
- You have to say, "Go."
- Go.

819
00:33:04,614 --> 00:33:07,413
(Spinning)

820
00:33:07,414 --> 00:33:11,714
(How good is he when it really counts?)

821
00:33:12,414 --> 00:33:13,443
A dollar?

822
00:33:13,444 --> 00:33:16,674
(It's only a dollar.)

823
00:33:17,114 --> 00:33:21,043
(He was doing well before.)

824
00:33:21,044 --> 00:33:22,044
(He feels guilty now.)

825
00:33:22,045 --> 00:33:25,073
I'm sorry.

826
00:33:25,074 --> 00:33:27,814
Take your dollar. I'm sorry.

827
00:33:27,874 --> 00:33:29,844
I landed on 100 dollars before.

828
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:32,673
I don't know what happened
to the 99 dollars.

829
00:33:32,674 --> 00:33:35,513
He gave you another item, so
we'll give you one more chance.

830
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,174
- One more chance?
- Okay.

831
00:33:37,244 --> 00:33:38,673
- It's our last chance.
- I'll do it.

832
00:33:38,674 --> 00:33:39,773
Go.

833
00:33:39,774 --> 00:33:41,043
(He needs every luck he can afford.)

834
00:33:41,044 --> 00:33:42,613
I hope it's the infinite check.

835
00:33:42,614 --> 00:33:44,213
(He spins it with all the
luck he can afford.)

836
00:33:44,214 --> 00:33:45,343
Infinite check.

837
00:33:45,344 --> 00:33:48,544
(They need a big one this time.)

838
00:33:50,474 --> 00:33:54,673
(It lands on 100 dollars.)

839
00:33:54,674 --> 00:33:55,943
You did it!

840
00:33:55,944 --> 00:33:57,973
(It's the miracle of the unlucky one.)

841
00:33:57,974 --> 00:33:59,773
(That was the 1st time in 7 years.)

842
00:33:59,774 --> 00:34:01,873
- It's 100 dollars.
- Good job.

843
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,943
See?

844
00:34:03,944 --> 00:34:05,773
(I'm happy you got 100 dollars.)

845
00:34:05,774 --> 00:34:07,713
- 100 dollars? Really?
- They really give it to you?

846
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:10,073
That's awesome. They give
it to you right away.

847
00:34:10,074 --> 00:34:11,713
(They earned 2 items plus 100 dollars.)

848
00:34:11,714 --> 00:34:13,343
(The unlucky ones are doing well today.)

849
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:15,773
- Is that yours now?
- This is amazing.

850
00:34:15,774 --> 00:34:17,773
- We're leaving.
- See you.

851
00:34:17,774 --> 00:34:19,573
See you, Woo Jong.

852
00:34:19,574 --> 00:34:21,674
- Thank you.
- No problem.

853
00:34:21,944 --> 00:34:24,413
(They get going after
meeting the new groom.)

854
00:34:24,414 --> 00:34:26,114
I think we're hitting most of it.

855
00:34:26,614 --> 00:34:29,244
We're lucky there are
people getting married.

856
00:34:29,314 --> 00:34:32,244
- Good thing we went to his house.
- Exactly.

857
00:34:32,514 --> 00:34:35,114
We have 100 dollars,

858
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:37,914
so let's tell the members that
we'll get the television.

859
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:40,644
- That's right.
- We can even buy games.

860
00:34:40,974 --> 00:34:43,114
- Do you think we can?
- No,

861
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,314
we have to go see it first.

862
00:34:45,444 --> 00:34:48,673
- We can get a small one.
- We can get a 27-inch.

863
00:34:48,674 --> 00:34:49,944
That's right.

864
00:34:50,444 --> 00:34:52,883
- There it is. It says "Recycling".
- Where?

865
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:54,773
- Okay.
- Okay.

866
00:34:54,774 --> 00:34:57,213
- Here it is.
- Okay.

867
00:34:57,214 --> 00:34:58,713
It's going to be fun.

868
00:34:58,714 --> 00:35:00,883
- This is amazing.
- Look at that.

869
00:35:00,884 --> 00:35:02,973
- They sell those.
- They should have parasols as well.

870
00:35:02,974 --> 00:35:04,673
- They should.
- They have refrigerators too.

871
00:35:04,674 --> 00:35:05,973
(It looks like they have everything.)

872
00:35:05,974 --> 00:35:07,613
The price is the problem.

873
00:35:07,614 --> 00:35:09,044
I don't think they'll be expensive.

874
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:12,473
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.

875
00:35:12,474 --> 00:35:15,014
- Hello.
- Oh, dear.

876
00:35:15,574 --> 00:35:17,944
- Can we browse?
- Sure.

877
00:35:18,474 --> 00:35:20,344
There are so many interesting things.

878
00:35:20,714 --> 00:35:22,843
- Look at the fridge.
- It's 40 dollars.

879
00:35:22,844 --> 00:35:24,883
(They were here for a TV, but
they look at something else.)

880
00:35:24,884 --> 00:35:27,213
- It's 170 dollars.
- It's expensive.

881
00:35:27,214 --> 00:35:28,474
(The fridge is expensive.)

882
00:35:29,974 --> 00:35:32,173
- This one's nice.
- How much is it?

883
00:35:32,174 --> 00:35:33,343
It's 530 dollars.

884
00:35:33,344 --> 00:35:35,073
(They look at all the fridges.)

885
00:35:35,074 --> 00:35:36,444
We can't get one.

886
00:35:38,744 --> 00:35:40,474
Are there any small ones?

887
00:35:40,884 --> 00:35:44,114
There must be 50-dollar ones.
We need half that size.

888
00:35:46,384 --> 00:35:47,844
What about this?

889
00:35:48,574 --> 00:35:50,073
This is 100 dollars.

890
00:35:50,074 --> 00:35:52,073
- This is 100?
- It is.

891
00:35:52,074 --> 00:35:54,413
(They want a fridge more
than a television.)

892
00:35:54,414 --> 00:35:55,473
This one's perfect.

893
00:35:55,474 --> 00:35:58,313
Is there something smaller
than this that's 50 dollars?

894
00:35:58,314 --> 00:36:01,074
What's the cheapest television you have?

895
00:36:01,384 --> 00:36:04,644
- Let's look at this one.
- It's expensive. It's 230 dollars.

896
00:36:05,614 --> 00:36:07,744
- This is 50 dollars.
- It is.

897
00:36:08,774 --> 00:36:10,573
It works well.

898
00:36:10,574 --> 00:36:12,274
(It looks decent.)

899
00:36:14,044 --> 00:36:17,413
(If we get this television, we
only have 50 dollars left.)

900
00:36:17,414 --> 00:36:21,844
(Do we have to give up on the fridge then?)

901
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:25,883
Should we call them?

902
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:27,574
It's more expensive than we thought.

903
00:36:27,714 --> 00:36:28,714
(Is it the TV or the fridge?)

904
00:36:28,715 --> 00:36:31,384
- They might not pick up.
- The television works well.

905
00:36:33,674 --> 00:36:35,174
- Hello?
- Hello?

906
00:36:35,884 --> 00:36:38,384
Do you want a fridge or a TV?

907
00:36:38,474 --> 00:36:40,573
Television? That's awesome.

908
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:43,513
We can take care of the fridge.

909
00:36:43,514 --> 00:36:44,714
You think so? All right.

910
00:36:44,944 --> 00:36:46,014
Bye.

911
00:36:46,074 --> 00:36:48,344
It's 100 dollars, so should we get it?

912
00:36:49,744 --> 00:36:52,344
- Should we get that?
- What if we get this?

913
00:36:53,614 --> 00:36:55,414
- Should we get this?
- The fridge?

914
00:36:56,074 --> 00:36:57,883
You're debating...

915
00:36:57,884 --> 00:36:59,273
because the television is 50
dollars and the fridge...

916
00:36:59,274 --> 00:37:00,674
- is 100, right?
- Yes.

917
00:37:00,944 --> 00:37:02,884
What if...

918
00:37:03,044 --> 00:37:05,944
we bet 50 dollars...

919
00:37:06,144 --> 00:37:07,974
and play a game of roulette?

920
00:37:09,174 --> 00:37:10,314
(A game of roulette?)

921
00:37:10,384 --> 00:37:11,843
- Let's do it.
- How do you play it?

922
00:37:11,844 --> 00:37:13,644
We spin the roulette...

923
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:15,513
and whoever gets the larger amount wins.

924
00:37:15,514 --> 00:37:16,883
Let's do it.

925
00:37:16,884 --> 00:37:18,473
If you lose, we take 50 dollars from you.

926
00:37:18,474 --> 00:37:20,914
- We know.
- We can buy the television then.

927
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:23,244
If we win, we can get both.

928
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:25,814
Are you going to play or not?

929
00:37:28,114 --> 00:37:29,943
I used all the luck I
had on the 100 dollars.

930
00:37:29,944 --> 00:37:31,273
I'll do it.

931
00:37:31,274 --> 00:37:33,383
Don't do it.

932
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,384
Let's do it.

933
00:37:34,674 --> 00:37:36,944
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

934
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:39,973
- I'll do it. Do I go first?
- Okay.

935
00:37:39,974 --> 00:37:42,144
Say, "Go." Don't make excuses.

936
00:37:42,574 --> 00:37:43,943
- Go.
- Go.

937
00:37:43,944 --> 00:37:45,244
(The director goes first.)

938
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:49,673
(I hope it's a small amount.)

939
00:37:49,674 --> 00:37:52,343
(What number would he land on?)

940
00:37:52,344 --> 00:37:53,344
10 dollars.

941
00:37:53,384 --> 00:37:55,174
(He gets 10 dollars.)

942
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:56,883
This is bad.

943
00:37:56,884 --> 00:37:58,273
(They need something bigger
than 10 dollars to win.)

944
00:37:58,274 --> 00:37:59,313
Go.

945
00:37:59,314 --> 00:38:00,813
(Jae Seok goes after.)

946
00:38:00,814 --> 00:38:03,713
(Hopefully, he has some luck left.)

947
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:07,883
(Would he kill 2 birds with 1 stone?)

948
00:38:07,884 --> 00:38:11,174
(He lands on one dollar.)

949
00:38:12,814 --> 00:38:14,383
I said I was going to do it.

950
00:38:14,384 --> 00:38:16,443
- Give me the money.
- Come on.

951
00:38:16,444 --> 00:38:17,773
(They lose 50 dollars.)

952
00:38:17,774 --> 00:38:21,344
- It makes me laugh.
- Give it to me.

953
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,073
- My gosh.
- One dollar.

954
00:38:23,074 --> 00:38:25,974
What's wrong with us? We're so unlucky.

955
00:38:26,274 --> 00:38:28,614
What now? We need to get the fridge.

956
00:38:29,884 --> 00:38:31,144
Let's bet this as well.

957
00:38:31,574 --> 00:38:32,574
Let's bet this as well.

958
00:38:32,575 --> 00:38:34,243
(Let's bet everything on this.)

959
00:38:34,244 --> 00:38:36,383
Do it.

960
00:38:36,384 --> 00:38:37,773
(Let's bet 50 more dollars
and spin it again.)

961
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,673
- There you go.
- Are you sure?

962
00:38:39,674 --> 00:38:41,773
- Of course.
- Let's do it.

963
00:38:41,774 --> 00:38:43,343
We have nothing more.

964
00:38:43,344 --> 00:38:45,774
But let me go first. Let me do it.

965
00:38:46,414 --> 00:38:47,414
Go.

966
00:38:47,415 --> 00:38:52,443
(What would Seok Jin land on?)

967
00:38:52,444 --> 00:38:55,774
(One dollar)

968
00:38:56,384 --> 00:38:59,244
(Shoot)

969
00:38:59,574 --> 00:39:01,383
- You get nothing if you lose.
- Okay.

970
00:39:01,384 --> 00:39:03,843
- How's this possible?
- What's wrong with us?

971
00:39:03,844 --> 00:39:05,313
I don't understand.

972
00:39:05,314 --> 00:39:07,273
(What would the director land on?)

973
00:39:07,274 --> 00:39:11,384
(He gets 10 dollars again.)

974
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:15,444
You're a gambler.

975
00:39:16,044 --> 00:39:18,513
- You're good at this.
- Is this how you bought a house?

976
00:39:18,514 --> 00:39:21,173
- Hold on.
- I swear you did.

977
00:39:21,174 --> 00:39:24,474
How's this possible? I don't understand.

978
00:39:25,414 --> 00:39:28,914
Gambling robs you of your fortune.

979
00:39:29,474 --> 00:39:30,644
You should never...

980
00:39:30,944 --> 00:39:34,173
bet your luck on something so trivial.

981
00:39:34,174 --> 00:39:36,213
We got a dollar again. How's that possible?

982
00:39:36,214 --> 00:39:37,214
You see...

983
00:39:37,215 --> 00:39:39,444
(What just happened?)

984
00:39:39,714 --> 00:39:41,573
- We'll be back.
- Sorry?

985
00:39:41,574 --> 00:39:43,043
(They're quiet.)

986
00:39:43,044 --> 00:39:45,574
I'm sorry. We wanted to get them.

987
00:39:46,574 --> 00:39:49,143
- Why did you agree on this?
- We didn't know he gambles.

988
00:39:49,144 --> 00:39:51,944
- Why did you agree to play this?
- He's a gambler.

989
00:39:53,074 --> 00:39:54,543
(He is doomed by the roulette.)

990
00:39:54,544 --> 00:39:56,974
- What a letdown.
- You agreed too.

991
00:39:59,074 --> 00:40:01,244
- Call them.
- This is driving me nuts.

992
00:40:02,044 --> 00:40:04,614
- What a letdown.
- My gosh.

993
00:40:05,144 --> 00:40:07,414
- This is driving me nuts.
- What a letdown.

994
00:40:08,244 --> 00:40:09,843
(They can't explain the feeling.)

995
00:40:09,844 --> 00:40:11,414
We worked so hard for that money.

996
00:40:13,474 --> 00:40:14,944
What now?

997
00:40:15,074 --> 00:40:16,513
This is driving me nuts.

998
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:17,844
(What are we supposed to tell the others?)

999
00:40:18,074 --> 00:40:21,243
- What now?
- This is driving me insane.

1000
00:40:21,244 --> 00:40:22,244
(Let's not do this ever again.)

1001
00:40:22,245 --> 00:40:23,644
I'm ashamed of myself.

1002
00:40:24,244 --> 00:40:26,774
Do you want to bet the gas burner?

1003
00:40:28,474 --> 00:40:30,043
- Don't do that.
- What are you trying to do?

1004
00:40:30,044 --> 00:40:32,674
- He's a gambler.
- We're on television right now.

1005
00:40:33,144 --> 00:40:35,343
Why do you keep asking us to bet things?

1006
00:40:35,344 --> 00:40:36,944
(We barely made up our minds.)

1007
00:40:37,044 --> 00:40:38,844
Let's do it.

1008
00:40:39,414 --> 00:40:40,443
Let's do it.

1009
00:40:40,444 --> 00:40:41,473
(Their firm and determined
response is "Go.")

1010
00:40:41,474 --> 00:40:42,544
We can get a television.

1011
00:40:42,884 --> 00:40:43,944
We want the television.

1012
00:40:44,344 --> 00:40:46,473
How much would you give us
if we bet on the gas burner?

1013
00:40:46,474 --> 00:40:47,743
We'll bet 50 dollars.
50 dollars?

1014
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:49,044
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

1015
00:40:49,544 --> 00:40:50,943
Are you going to do it?

1016
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,774
- Don't do it.
- You can do it.

1017
00:40:52,944 --> 00:40:54,044
You keep losing.

1018
00:40:54,214 --> 00:40:55,443
Do rock, paper, scissors.

1019
00:40:55,444 --> 00:40:56,473
Rock, paper, scissors.

1020
00:40:56,474 --> 00:40:58,843
- I won. You can go first.
- Go first.

1021
00:40:58,844 --> 00:41:01,243
- I'm going to watch you.
- What's wrong with it?

1022
00:41:01,244 --> 00:41:02,413
(The director goes first.)

1023
00:41:02,414 --> 00:41:03,473
One dollar.

1024
00:41:03,474 --> 00:41:07,443
(Would he get 10 dollars
this time as well?)

1025
00:41:07,444 --> 00:41:08,573
That's right!

1026
00:41:08,574 --> 00:41:11,343
(He gets a dollar this time.)

1027
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:13,943
(We have a chance.)

1028
00:41:13,944 --> 00:41:15,243
We can get the television.

1029
00:41:15,244 --> 00:41:16,844
(We win if we get 10 dollars or more.)

1030
00:41:18,644 --> 00:41:22,473
(If they win, they accomplish
a part of their goal.)

1031
00:41:22,474 --> 00:41:27,243
(If they lose, they'll get Woo
Jong's gas burner taken away.)

1032
00:41:27,244 --> 00:41:32,843
(What will be the result
of this last round?)

1033
00:41:32,844 --> 00:41:35,943
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin
win with 10 dollars.)

1034
00:41:35,944 --> 00:41:38,473
(They get 50 dollars.)

1035
00:41:38,474 --> 00:41:39,644
That's it.

1036
00:41:40,074 --> 00:41:42,544
- Bring it.
- Give us 50 dollars.

1037
00:41:43,344 --> 00:41:44,443
Thank you.

1038
00:41:44,444 --> 00:41:45,843
(After an intense match,
they get a television.)

1039
00:41:45,844 --> 00:41:48,414
- Take care. Thank you.
- Which one's our car?

1040
00:41:48,744 --> 00:41:50,043
- Is this it?
- This is it.

1041
00:41:50,044 --> 00:41:51,484
(At least they won't be humiliated.)

1042
00:41:53,314 --> 00:41:55,044
- I'll call Ji Min.
- Sure.

1043
00:41:56,044 --> 00:41:58,144
- Don't come.
- Ji Min.

1044
00:41:58,944 --> 00:42:01,644
- Don't come.
- Why not? We're already here.

1045
00:42:01,774 --> 00:42:02,944
Can you come down?

1046
00:42:02,974 --> 00:42:04,514
- There she is.
- Where?

1047
00:42:04,574 --> 00:42:05,644
Ji Min.

1048
00:42:05,674 --> 00:42:06,773
Drive safe.

1049
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,343
- Come down.
- Come on.

1050
00:42:09,344 --> 00:42:10,613
Come down, Ji Min.

1051
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:13,344
(Kim Ji Min, Korea's most
beautiful comedienne)

1052
00:42:13,944 --> 00:42:15,343
(She lets them in on a surprise visit.)

1053
00:42:15,344 --> 00:42:16,883
She has a puppy.

1054
00:42:16,884 --> 00:42:18,844
Your house is so nice.

1055
00:42:19,074 --> 00:42:20,943
Look at her house.

1056
00:42:20,944 --> 00:42:22,843
(Her puppy welcomes them.)

1057
00:42:22,844 --> 00:42:23,944
You're so cute.

1058
00:42:24,714 --> 00:42:26,744
You're so clean.

1059
00:42:26,974 --> 00:42:28,213
- I'm clean.
- It smells like a lady's house.

1060
00:42:28,214 --> 00:42:29,943
Look at the wine.

1061
00:42:29,944 --> 00:42:31,513
(Her house is clean and pretty.)

1062
00:42:31,514 --> 00:42:32,973
You've lit a candle.

1063
00:42:32,974 --> 00:42:36,214
- I need to wipe off...
- We feel bad.

1064
00:42:36,474 --> 00:42:38,644
- Can you wipe off the dust?
- Sure, I'll do it.

1065
00:42:38,884 --> 00:42:40,644
I feel bad now.

1066
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:42,244
What are you doing?

1067
00:42:42,444 --> 00:42:45,244
- He's trying to look cute.
- I'm not.

1068
00:42:45,444 --> 00:42:47,943
- He's acting like he's warmhearted.
- I'm not. I love puppies.

1069
00:42:47,944 --> 00:42:49,773
Stop lying. I've never
seen you with a puppy.

1070
00:42:49,774 --> 00:42:51,743
I feel bad looking around your house.

1071
00:42:51,744 --> 00:42:54,213
This is so cool.

1072
00:42:54,214 --> 00:42:56,883
Do you sit here by yourself and play games?

1073
00:42:56,884 --> 00:42:58,243
- No, I don't.
- Don't you play games?

1074
00:42:58,244 --> 00:43:00,043
- I read books here.
- You read?

1075
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,144
Of course.

1076
00:43:01,514 --> 00:43:03,444
You have two refrigerators.

1077
00:43:03,744 --> 00:43:05,213
How are you going to take that?

1078
00:43:05,214 --> 00:43:07,213
- We can't take it.
- Your vacuum.

1079
00:43:07,214 --> 00:43:08,744
You can't take it. It's broken.

1080
00:43:09,144 --> 00:43:11,714
- Wait a minute.
- It just broke.

1081
00:43:11,774 --> 00:43:13,244
It just broke?

1082
00:43:13,944 --> 00:43:15,074
Look. This...

1083
00:43:15,614 --> 00:43:17,543
You can't take this.

1084
00:43:17,544 --> 00:43:20,213
- No, I'm not taking it.
- You have so many awards.

1085
00:43:20,214 --> 00:43:22,444
- You can't take this.
- I'm not taking this.

1086
00:43:22,574 --> 00:43:24,043
There's nothing. Get out.

1087
00:43:24,044 --> 00:43:25,883
(There's nothing she doesn't use.)

1088
00:43:25,884 --> 00:43:27,043
- You want us to get out?
- Get out.

1089
00:43:27,044 --> 00:43:28,044
Don't say that.

1090
00:43:28,045 --> 00:43:29,885
- Take the printer.
- Who's that? Is that you?

1091
00:43:30,614 --> 00:43:32,343
- You used to be so pretty.
- Do you want it?

1092
00:43:32,344 --> 00:43:34,573
- It'll make you feel better.
- It's okay.

1093
00:43:34,574 --> 00:43:36,443
- It's fine. I'll give it to you.
- It's okay.

1094
00:43:36,444 --> 00:43:39,143
- It's okay. We're fine.
- It'll make you feel better.

1095
00:43:39,144 --> 00:43:41,513
- Hang it up on the wall.
- You used to be so pretty.

1096
00:43:41,514 --> 00:43:42,644
- Of course.
- Let's see.

1097
00:43:42,974 --> 00:43:44,614
- Right?
- You're right.

1098
00:43:44,644 --> 00:43:47,143
- You were so charming.
- I'll give you all of them to take.

1099
00:43:47,144 --> 00:43:48,344
It's okay.

1100
00:43:48,744 --> 00:43:51,414
We can't take anything.

1101
00:43:51,944 --> 00:43:54,473
- I do have something I don't need.
- What is it?

1102
00:43:54,474 --> 00:43:56,443
- You have something?
- Give us everything you don't need.

1103
00:43:56,444 --> 00:43:59,044
It's too out of style, so I stored it away.

1104
00:43:59,514 --> 00:44:01,074
- Let's see.
- It's a chair.

1105
00:44:01,944 --> 00:44:03,944
Ji Hyo doesn't have to sit on the floor.

1106
00:44:04,444 --> 00:44:07,614
- What do you think?
- It's a chair with a back.

1107
00:44:07,714 --> 00:44:10,074
Try sitting on it.

1108
00:44:10,574 --> 00:44:12,343
- It's nice.
- It's not bad.

1109
00:44:12,344 --> 00:44:14,144
- It's so comfortable.
- It's nice.

1110
00:44:14,244 --> 00:44:20,044
Since you're giving this chair to us...

1111
00:44:20,344 --> 00:44:22,313
- The puppy...
- Are you going to ask for a favor?

1112
00:44:22,314 --> 00:44:24,044
Can you walk him for the first time?

1113
00:44:24,214 --> 00:44:27,714
I brought him outside before,

1114
00:44:27,774 --> 00:44:29,143
- He doesn't move?
- But he doesn't move.

1115
00:44:29,144 --> 00:44:32,044
- Really?
- He never walked outside before.

1116
00:44:32,244 --> 00:44:34,713
- Should we go?
- You want us to walk him?

1117
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:37,843
- Okay, we can do that.
- It'll be great if he walks.

1118
00:44:37,844 --> 00:44:38,844
(They decide to walk the dog.)

1119
00:44:38,845 --> 00:44:41,314
- Jong Kook, that's a good spot.
- It's sunny.

1120
00:44:41,544 --> 00:44:44,043
- Neu Kkim.
- Neu Kkim. We know how it feels.

1121
00:44:44,044 --> 00:44:46,313
- We know how it feels.
- Neu Kkim.

1122
00:44:46,314 --> 00:44:48,614
We know how to walk.
Let's go this way. Come.

1123
00:44:49,044 --> 00:44:50,944
(This is how you walk.)

1124
00:44:51,144 --> 00:44:52,344
Good job.

1125
00:44:52,744 --> 00:44:54,714
Come here, Neu Kkim. Catch me.

1126
00:44:55,244 --> 00:44:57,613
You're fast.

1127
00:44:57,614 --> 00:45:00,144
(He's as excited as the puppy.)

1128
00:45:01,944 --> 00:45:03,143
(Neu Kkim did well, so
that wasn't difficult.)

1129
00:45:03,144 --> 00:45:04,973
- Good job.
- He runs well.

1130
00:45:04,974 --> 00:45:07,144
- Give us the roulette.
- There you go.

1131
00:45:08,144 --> 00:45:09,714
- You can spin it.
- Go ahead, Ji Min.

1132
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:12,544
This is how you do it. Do I spin it?

1133
00:45:12,574 --> 00:45:13,774
- Do I spin it?
- Spin it this way.

1134
00:45:13,874 --> 00:45:14,973
(She doesn't hesitate.)

1135
00:45:14,974 --> 00:45:16,244
You're too careless.

1136
00:45:16,444 --> 00:45:18,514
(Spinning)

1137
00:45:20,544 --> 00:45:21,844
You're too careless.

1138
00:45:23,344 --> 00:45:24,514
Infinite check!

1139
00:45:25,944 --> 00:45:27,243
(It's an infinite check.)

1140
00:45:27,244 --> 00:45:29,043
You're insane.

1141
00:45:29,044 --> 00:45:31,843
(That's amazing.)

1142
00:45:31,844 --> 00:45:33,713
- You're insane.
- What's going on?

1143
00:45:33,714 --> 00:45:35,243
It's an infinite check.

1144
00:45:35,244 --> 00:45:37,473
- This is real.
- How is this possible?

1145
00:45:37,474 --> 00:45:38,513
We got an infinite check.

1146
00:45:38,514 --> 00:45:39,943
Can you get anything you want?

1147
00:45:39,944 --> 00:45:42,943
- We can get a fridge.
- Really?

1148
00:45:42,944 --> 00:45:46,044
- We're getting a fridge.
- Thank you, Ji Min.

1149
00:45:46,314 --> 00:45:47,443
I didn't know you were so lucky.

1150
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:48,944
Why are they all glaring at me?

1151
00:45:50,144 --> 00:45:51,513
- We're getting a fridge.
- Really?

1152
00:45:51,514 --> 00:45:53,844
Isn't this a miracle?

1153
00:45:54,344 --> 00:45:56,413
We have no time. It's 6:30pm.

1154
00:45:56,414 --> 00:45:57,744
Let's hurry.

1155
00:45:58,044 --> 00:45:59,044
Ha Nan.

1156
00:45:59,045 --> 00:46:00,343
(Jong Kook visits his stylist.)

1157
00:46:00,344 --> 00:46:01,444
Come here.

1158
00:46:01,714 --> 00:46:03,213
- It's so heavy.
- I have that too.

1159
00:46:03,214 --> 00:46:04,513
- Up there.
- What's that?

1160
00:46:04,514 --> 00:46:05,613
She has it.

1161
00:46:05,614 --> 00:46:07,344
- Okay.
- You have a parasol.

1162
00:46:07,674 --> 00:46:10,444
You put this together.

1163
00:46:10,744 --> 00:46:12,773
This is a parasol.

1164
00:46:12,774 --> 00:46:14,844
- It's a perfect table.
- That's right.

1165
00:46:14,944 --> 00:46:16,243
It's a parasol.

1166
00:46:16,244 --> 00:46:18,714
(They earn 10 out of 16 items.)

1167
00:46:19,244 --> 00:46:20,974
- There it is. We're here.
- Where?

1168
00:46:21,144 --> 00:46:22,974
He's doing an interview right now.

1169
00:46:23,844 --> 00:46:25,444
- Hello.
- Hello.

1170
00:46:26,414 --> 00:46:28,444
Let's eat first.

1171
00:46:28,874 --> 00:46:30,044
Don't go.

1172
00:46:30,744 --> 00:46:32,043
He's being interviewed.

1173
00:46:32,044 --> 00:46:33,444
- Interviewed?
- He is.

1174
00:46:33,644 --> 00:46:34,744
He's a celebrity.

1175
00:46:35,144 --> 00:46:36,464
Jung Min's sitting in the middle,

1176
00:46:36,614 --> 00:46:38,644
- and there are people around him.
- Really?

1177
00:46:39,144 --> 00:46:40,314
There's only one left.

1178
00:46:40,944 --> 00:46:44,644
We talked to your dad about the sofa.

1179
00:46:45,644 --> 00:46:47,214
- Let's ask him.
- Should we?

1180
00:46:47,974 --> 00:46:49,514
- Hello?
- Hello.

1181
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:52,744
Have you thought about a wish?

1182
00:46:53,214 --> 00:46:55,343
- What was that?
- A wish.

1183
00:46:55,344 --> 00:46:56,614
(They want to know his wish.)

1184
00:46:57,044 --> 00:46:59,043
(Three hour earlier, they
were coming up with plans.)

1185
00:46:59,044 --> 00:47:01,343
Are there any sofas you don't use at work?

1186
00:47:01,344 --> 00:47:02,543
- Sofas we don't use?
- Yes.

1187
00:47:02,544 --> 00:47:05,613
- It doesn't have to be nice.
- I'll have to look.

1188
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:08,414
- Can you have a look?
- All right.

1189
00:47:08,474 --> 00:47:10,413
Have you thought about a wish?

1190
00:47:10,414 --> 00:47:13,243
(What is his wish in
exchange for the sofa?)

1191
00:47:13,244 --> 00:47:14,924
Song Joong Ki and Jo In Sung's autographs.

1192
00:47:16,614 --> 00:47:19,343
That's great. That's perfect.

1193
00:47:19,344 --> 00:47:22,444
Why would you ask me for that?

1194
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:25,543
Is that what your employees want?

1195
00:47:25,544 --> 00:47:28,613
You just need Song Joong Ki and...

1196
00:47:28,614 --> 00:47:32,943
- Jo In Sung's autographs, right?
- Your son is Lee Kwang Soo.

1197
00:47:32,944 --> 00:47:35,743
- Tell them not to upset me.
- I see.

1198
00:47:35,744 --> 00:47:39,544
We'll get the autographs and
send the pictures to you.

1199
00:47:39,674 --> 00:47:40,943
Sure.

1200
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:42,743
- I have my own signature too.
- Stop it.

1201
00:47:42,744 --> 00:47:44,474
Yours is not important.

1202
00:47:44,744 --> 00:47:46,944
Hurry. Call Joong Ki and In Sung.

1203
00:47:47,414 --> 00:47:50,344
Hurry up and call Joong Ki and In Sung.

1204
00:47:52,044 --> 00:47:53,243
(He's embarrassed to ask.)

1205
00:47:53,244 --> 00:47:55,674
That's the only way we can get the sofa.

1206
00:47:56,844 --> 00:47:58,343
I know it's not difficult.

1207
00:47:58,344 --> 00:48:00,024
(Jung Min gets them food while they wait.)

1208
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:02,474
- Hi, In Sung.
- Aren't you working?

1209
00:48:02,574 --> 00:48:04,844
- I'm filming right now.
- Okay.

1210
00:48:05,144 --> 00:48:06,344
Can I...

1211
00:48:07,874 --> 00:48:08,943
- Hello?
- Hi.

1212
00:48:08,944 --> 00:48:10,144
I'm not buying.

1213
00:48:10,544 --> 00:48:12,943
Don't do that.

1214
00:48:12,944 --> 00:48:14,244
- In Sung.
- Yes.

1215
00:48:14,414 --> 00:48:17,243
I need your autograph.

1216
00:48:17,244 --> 00:48:20,713
You can leave the parcel
in front of my house.

1217
00:48:20,714 --> 00:48:22,774
What are you talking about?

1218
00:48:22,974 --> 00:48:24,414
- Thank you.
- In Sung.

1219
00:48:24,744 --> 00:48:26,613
You can leave it at the real estate office.

1220
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:28,974
I'm not leaving anything.
That's not why I called.

1221
00:48:29,514 --> 00:48:30,844
I need your autograph.

1222
00:48:31,844 --> 00:48:33,513
I don't have an autograph anymore.

1223
00:48:33,514 --> 00:48:36,513
What do you mean? How's that possible?

1224
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:38,234
- I only shake hands these days.
- In Sung.

1225
00:48:38,714 --> 00:48:41,214
- Don't lie.
- I don't have one anymore.

1226
00:48:41,744 --> 00:48:43,844
- I'm eating. Call back later.
- Are you eating?

1227
00:48:44,044 --> 00:48:45,614
- Yes.
- I'll call you back.

1228
00:48:45,674 --> 00:48:46,844
Sure.

1229
00:48:47,444 --> 00:48:49,474
(I'll be nice because we need the sofa.)

1230
00:48:50,144 --> 00:48:51,844
(What are you guys doing?)

1231
00:48:52,244 --> 00:48:53,674
Hello.

1232
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:56,474
- Long time no see.
- How are you?

1233
00:48:57,044 --> 00:48:59,514
- Excuse us.
- Thank you for the food, Jung Min.

1234
00:49:00,044 --> 00:49:02,873
- Excuse us.
- We ate before we saw you.

1235
00:49:02,874 --> 00:49:03,974
(Actor Park Jung Min, the
rising star of Chungmuro)

1236
00:49:04,314 --> 00:49:05,644
- You're moving, right?
- Yes.

1237
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:07,473
- You're moving in two days, right?
- Yes.

1238
00:49:07,474 --> 00:49:08,644
What are you throwing away?

1239
00:49:09,214 --> 00:49:11,574
- I'm throwing out my bidet.
- And then?

1240
00:49:11,874 --> 00:49:13,744
Here are the list of items we need.

1241
00:49:13,844 --> 00:49:15,443
- We're already getting the sofa.
- These are what we need.

1242
00:49:15,444 --> 00:49:16,444
What's this?

1243
00:49:16,445 --> 00:49:18,143
- Numbers.
- Numbers we need.

1244
00:49:18,144 --> 00:49:19,424
Is there a fridge you don't use?

1245
00:49:19,844 --> 00:49:21,844
- Are you going to take it?
- Who doesn't use one?

1246
00:49:22,314 --> 00:49:24,744
- That's not what I meant.
- Everybody uses it.

1247
00:49:24,844 --> 00:49:26,843
- Do you have a claw crane?
- Claw crane?

1248
00:49:26,844 --> 00:49:28,443
- You don't own a claw crane?
- I don't.

1249
00:49:28,444 --> 00:49:31,074
- Darts? Don't you play games?
- No.

1250
00:49:31,674 --> 00:49:33,514
What do you do?

1251
00:49:33,644 --> 00:49:34,843
I have a bidet.

1252
00:49:34,844 --> 00:49:36,773
- Only the bidet?
- Yes.

1253
00:49:36,774 --> 00:49:39,244
- Can't you take it from my house?
- Then...

1254
00:49:39,974 --> 00:49:43,174
I know it's a lot to ask.

1255
00:49:43,544 --> 00:49:46,444
If he gives us his passcode,
we'll go to his house.

1256
00:49:46,514 --> 00:49:49,314
- We'll go there.
- We'll take his bidet and leave.

1257
00:49:49,644 --> 00:49:51,543
- Okay.
- We'll assemble it.

1258
00:49:51,544 --> 00:49:53,143
We need to do you a favor.

1259
00:49:53,144 --> 00:49:55,944
- Right.
- We'll grant you a wish.

1260
00:49:56,414 --> 00:49:57,844
May I advertise a movie?

1261
00:49:58,274 --> 00:50:00,743
- Of course.
- It can be anything you want.

1262
00:50:00,744 --> 00:50:03,143
- Isn't it okay for 30 seconds?
- Can you advertise it?

1263
00:50:03,144 --> 00:50:04,374
- Me?
- Yes.

1264
00:50:05,114 --> 00:50:07,274
(Asian Prince Kwang Soo
speaks about a movie.)

1265
00:50:07,314 --> 00:50:09,614
I won't tell you the movie's title.

1266
00:50:09,944 --> 00:50:12,443
The lead actors are Park
Jung Min and Ryu Hyun Kyung.

1267
00:50:12,444 --> 00:50:13,543
(It'll be a big hit.)

1268
00:50:13,544 --> 00:50:14,544
It sounds fun.

1269
00:50:14,744 --> 00:50:18,444
You can find it when you search
these actors on the Internet.

1270
00:50:18,644 --> 00:50:20,373
It's an incredible movie.

1271
00:50:20,374 --> 00:50:22,044
- When will it be released?
- On March 9.

1272
00:50:22,114 --> 00:50:24,774
- It's March 9.
- It makes you cry and laugh.

1273
00:50:24,874 --> 00:50:28,113
My goodness. How can I describe it?

1274
00:50:28,114 --> 00:50:29,144
You haven't seen it.

1275
00:50:30,044 --> 00:50:33,643
Don't say that. I was too
busy to go to the premiere.

1276
00:50:33,644 --> 00:50:35,343
Please watch the movie because it's fun.

1277
00:50:35,344 --> 00:50:38,013
You won't be disappointed. I
put my everything on the line.

1278
00:50:38,014 --> 00:50:40,114
(They advertise the movie in 30 seconds.)

1279
00:50:41,014 --> 00:50:42,144
Thank you.

1280
00:50:42,444 --> 00:50:45,174
It's much farther than I thought.

1281
00:50:45,614 --> 00:50:46,714
Let's call Joong Ki.

1282
00:50:52,944 --> 00:50:54,243
- Hello?
- Hey.

1283
00:50:54,244 --> 00:50:56,643
(Welcome back, Joong Ki.)

1284
00:50:56,644 --> 00:50:58,544
- Hi.
- We're shooting Running Man.

1285
00:50:58,814 --> 00:51:01,214
- Joong Ki, this is Ji Hyo.
- We have to...

1286
00:51:01,544 --> 00:51:03,443
- Hi, Ji Hyo.
- Get a sofa...

1287
00:51:03,444 --> 00:51:07,044
from my father, but I
need to grant him a wish.

1288
00:51:07,944 --> 00:51:10,214
His wish was to get your autograph.

1289
00:51:10,274 --> 00:51:13,973
- I don't know how it happened.
- Joong Ki.

1290
00:51:13,974 --> 00:51:15,713
- That's what's going on.
- We're in a hurry.

1291
00:51:15,714 --> 00:51:17,944
I'd like to get your autograph.

1292
00:51:18,114 --> 00:51:19,244
Are you far away?

1293
00:51:20,174 --> 00:51:22,374
Yes, I have to go to Gwangju, Gyeonggi-do.

1294
00:51:22,744 --> 00:51:24,373
We're coming to your office.

1295
00:51:24,374 --> 00:51:26,713
(We'll go anywhere for your autograph.)

1296
00:51:26,714 --> 00:51:28,614
I need your autograph.

1297
00:51:28,714 --> 00:51:31,443
Why does he wish to get my
autograph and not yours?

1298
00:51:31,444 --> 00:51:34,274
- How would I know?
- Are you okay?

1299
00:51:35,444 --> 00:51:37,713
- Of course, he isn't.
- That's his wish, okay?

1300
00:51:37,714 --> 00:51:38,843
I have no choice.

1301
00:51:38,844 --> 00:51:42,314
Can you give us your autograph?
We need to get it.

1302
00:51:42,514 --> 00:51:43,744
My manager may have it.

1303
00:51:43,874 --> 00:51:46,044
Does he? See you later.

1304
00:51:46,114 --> 00:51:47,974
- Good luck, Ji Hyo.
- Thank you.

1305
00:51:48,044 --> 00:51:49,444
Let's go to Gangnam.

1306
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,714
In Sung isn't answering.

1307
00:51:51,944 --> 00:51:54,613
(The remaining time is 1
hour and 40 minutes.)

1308
00:51:54,614 --> 00:51:57,343
(Where is Jong Kook and Haha going?)

1309
00:51:57,344 --> 00:51:58,974
- What's up?
- Tae Hyun.

1310
00:51:59,774 --> 00:52:01,143
(Who is he calling?)

1311
00:52:01,144 --> 00:52:02,713
- What?
- What are you doing?

1312
00:52:02,714 --> 00:52:04,514
- I'm at home.
- Tae Hyun.

1313
00:52:04,774 --> 00:52:05,944
Tae Hyun.

1314
00:52:06,544 --> 00:52:09,943
(He's calling someone named Tae Hyun.)

1315
00:52:09,944 --> 00:52:12,113
(Is he the man on "One Night Two Days"?)

1316
00:52:12,114 --> 00:52:13,744
- I'm at home.
- Tae Hyun.

1317
00:52:14,944 --> 00:52:17,374
I have a favor to ask.

1318
00:52:18,274 --> 00:52:20,144
We're shooting Running Man.

1319
00:52:21,344 --> 00:52:24,243
- Running Man?
- I know I shouldn't do this.

1320
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:26,843
(He tries to cast him on Running Man.)

1321
00:52:26,844 --> 00:52:29,813
It's okay if it's only my voice.

1322
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:32,944
Right, it could be only your voice...

1323
00:52:33,174 --> 00:52:35,643
- on Running Man.
- Is this a quiz?

1324
00:52:35,644 --> 00:52:37,374
It's nothing like that.

1325
00:52:38,174 --> 00:52:40,443
(How will he ask him to visit his house?)

1326
00:52:40,444 --> 00:52:43,913
May I see you for a minute?
We can blur your face out.

1327
00:52:43,914 --> 00:52:45,643
(He makes a difficult request.)

1328
00:52:45,644 --> 00:52:49,373
Could you appear on the show?

1329
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:51,514
We'll blur your face out.

1330
00:52:51,774 --> 00:52:53,374
I'll come to your house.

1331
00:52:54,644 --> 00:52:57,114
Could you...

1332
00:52:57,414 --> 00:53:00,944
I don't have many friends with children,

1333
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:04,174
but you do. Do you have
a mattress for babies?

1334
00:53:05,014 --> 00:53:07,243
Do you want a baby mattress?

1335
00:53:07,244 --> 00:53:10,973
Yes, may I get one from you?

1336
00:53:10,974 --> 00:53:13,344
Could we get a few, please?

1337
00:53:13,414 --> 00:53:16,313
- You want a few pieces?
- Yes.

1338
00:53:16,314 --> 00:53:19,043
- Just a few pieces.
- Do you know what it's like?

1339
00:53:19,044 --> 00:53:22,313
- Please give us a few pieces.
- I can't detach the pieces.

1340
00:53:22,314 --> 00:53:24,444
- May I get a piece?
- It's not detachable.

1341
00:53:24,844 --> 00:53:26,944
Then give me the whole thing.

1342
00:53:27,274 --> 00:53:28,513
(Jong Kook doesn't give up.)

1343
00:53:28,514 --> 00:53:30,744
- Come on.
- Why do you need it?

1344
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:33,173
On Running Man,

1345
00:53:33,174 --> 00:53:35,973
- we're trying to decorate...
- Don't tell him so much.

1346
00:53:35,974 --> 00:53:37,144
Anyway...

1347
00:53:38,174 --> 00:53:39,843
- Tae Hyun.
- Yes?

1348
00:53:39,844 --> 00:53:42,644
Come to our resting place
and spend a night.

1349
00:53:43,644 --> 00:53:44,843
We'll rent it out.

1350
00:53:44,844 --> 00:53:47,044
You may rent our resting place.

1351
00:53:47,544 --> 00:53:49,414
You can come and spend a night.

1352
00:53:49,774 --> 00:53:52,713
Anyway, - Call me when you arrive.

1353
00:53:52,714 --> 00:53:56,844
We're coming to your house.

1354
00:53:57,044 --> 00:54:00,174
- Gosh, he's easygoing.
- Yes, he is.

1355
00:54:00,544 --> 00:54:01,643
(They finally meet him.)

1356
00:54:01,644 --> 00:54:02,814
Let's ring the door.

1357
00:54:03,274 --> 00:54:05,444
- Is this the doorbell?
- Yes.

1358
00:54:08,544 --> 00:54:12,113
(What kind of a situation is this?)

1359
00:54:12,114 --> 00:54:14,043
(He still can't believe it.)

1360
00:54:14,044 --> 00:54:16,213
The gate is open. Excuse us.

1361
00:54:16,214 --> 00:54:18,814
- Excuse us.
- Is this the place?

1362
00:54:18,944 --> 00:54:21,043
Wait, is this the place?

1363
00:54:21,044 --> 00:54:24,114
(Today, they're meeting him
as a friend, not a rival.)

1364
00:54:24,974 --> 00:54:27,044
- Hello.
- My goodness.

1365
00:54:27,714 --> 00:54:29,273
(5-year-old Cha Soo Jin)

1366
00:54:29,274 --> 00:54:32,744
- Hello.
- Where's your dad?

1367
00:54:34,414 --> 00:54:37,043
(Actor Cha Tae Hyun)

1368
00:54:37,044 --> 00:54:38,113
Where's your dad?

1369
00:54:38,114 --> 00:54:40,644
(Mask Tae Hyun appears.)

1370
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,913
(He hasn't been on SBS
on Sunday in a while.)

1371
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:46,273
(He appears in a shocking manner.)

1372
00:54:46,274 --> 00:54:49,013
The production team and I know each other.

1373
00:54:49,014 --> 00:54:51,514
Blurring my face is more work for them.

1374
00:54:51,544 --> 00:54:53,313
Is that why you're wearing it?

1375
00:54:53,314 --> 00:54:54,813
I'm also wearing "One
Night Two Days" jacket.

1376
00:54:54,814 --> 00:54:57,513
- Really?
- Yes, look.

1377
00:54:57,514 --> 00:54:58,814
I see.

1378
00:54:59,144 --> 00:55:01,173
My daughter is laughing too.

1379
00:55:01,174 --> 00:55:03,274
- Hello.
- Hello.

1380
00:55:03,374 --> 00:55:05,873
- Hello.
- This is hilarious.

1381
00:55:05,874 --> 00:55:07,513
His daughter is excited.

1382
00:55:07,514 --> 00:55:09,244
She's so cute.

1383
00:55:09,614 --> 00:55:12,143
Did you say, a resting place?
Wait a minute.

1384
00:55:12,144 --> 00:55:14,043
- What is it?
- Do you have a dartboard?

1385
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:16,613
- Tae Hyun.
- Do you have a dartboard for kids?

1386
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:18,174
- I don't.
- He doesn't.

1387
00:55:18,274 --> 00:55:20,443
- I'm sorry for bothering you.
- I'm sorry.

1388
00:55:20,444 --> 00:55:22,913
- It's okay.
- Are you giving it to us?

1389
00:55:22,914 --> 00:55:24,774
- We need them.
- Tae Hyun.

1390
00:55:24,814 --> 00:55:26,443
You'll need it.

1391
00:55:26,444 --> 00:55:29,244
- What's this?
- Why are you wearing a mask?

1392
00:55:29,344 --> 00:55:31,814
- It's better this way.
- Are you going to sign it?

1393
00:55:31,874 --> 00:55:35,444
Here's what's incredible.
Tae Hyun is wearing a mask.

1394
00:55:36,014 --> 00:55:38,113
3 TV broadcasting stations became 1.

1395
00:55:38,114 --> 00:55:40,014
Tae Hyun signed here.

1396
00:55:40,274 --> 00:55:42,444
I'm impressed. You're so open-minded.

1397
00:55:42,774 --> 00:55:44,744
Isn't she so cute?

1398
00:55:44,844 --> 00:55:46,044
Come here.

1399
00:55:46,444 --> 00:55:47,914
(He's moved.)

1400
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:50,543
- Isn't she cute?
- She's the youngest.

1401
00:55:50,544 --> 00:55:52,264
(He supports the harmony of variety shows.)

1402
00:55:52,914 --> 00:55:56,113
(It's a historic moment as Korean
variety shows come together.)

1403
00:55:56,114 --> 00:56:01,014
(It's a festival of weekend
variety shows becoming one.)

1404
00:56:01,514 --> 00:56:02,713
You're so cute.

1405
00:56:02,714 --> 00:56:05,813
He doesn't need a microphone.

1406
00:56:05,814 --> 00:56:08,513
- You're so cute.
- We should let him go.

1407
00:56:08,514 --> 00:56:10,143
We're almost done.

1408
00:56:10,144 --> 00:56:12,013
- Next week...
- Could you sign here?

1409
00:56:12,014 --> 00:56:14,773
- Sign here?
- Sign your autograph.

1410
00:56:14,774 --> 00:56:16,043
(He signs the baby mattress.)

1411
00:56:16,044 --> 00:56:17,343
Goodness.

1412
00:56:17,344 --> 00:56:18,743
"King of Mask Singer",

1413
00:56:18,744 --> 00:56:21,114
"One Night Two Days", and
"Running Man" became one.

1414
00:56:21,174 --> 00:56:22,444
That's impressive.

1415
00:56:22,814 --> 00:56:25,043
- Right.
- Variety shows are one.

1416
00:56:25,044 --> 00:56:26,114
Thank you.

1417
00:56:26,214 --> 00:56:28,313
Tae Hyun is wearing a mask.

1418
00:56:28,314 --> 00:56:30,544
(We are the world.)

1419
00:56:31,174 --> 00:56:33,744
- Thank you, Tae Hyun.
- Thank you so much.

1420
00:56:34,244 --> 00:56:35,614
- It's good to see you.
- Gosh.

1421
00:56:37,414 --> 00:56:38,874
I wanted to try that.

1422
00:56:39,914 --> 00:56:41,973
Thank you so much.

1423
00:56:41,974 --> 00:56:45,044
- See you later.
- Thank you.

1424
00:56:46,044 --> 00:56:48,973
- Goodbye.
- Excuse us.

1425
00:56:48,974 --> 00:56:50,043
We won't need to blur your face out.

1426
00:56:50,044 --> 00:56:51,913
- Don't do it.
- Goodness.

1427
00:56:51,914 --> 00:56:54,314
- Don't blur it. Soo Jin.
- It's up to our imaginations.

1428
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:55,843
- Say goodbye.
- He's leaving.

1429
00:56:55,844 --> 00:56:57,713
- See you.
- Say, "Happy New Lunar Year".

1430
00:56:57,714 --> 00:56:59,843
She doesn't have to wear a mask.

1431
00:56:59,844 --> 00:57:00,873
She doesn't.

1432
00:57:00,874 --> 00:57:03,044
Just change her name to Jin Soo.

1433
00:57:03,944 --> 00:57:06,543
She was on "One Night Two Days" last week.

1434
00:57:06,544 --> 00:57:08,544
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1435
00:57:09,814 --> 00:57:11,643
We'll grant a wish.

1436
00:57:11,644 --> 00:57:14,274
- We have to do something.
- We have to give back...

1437
00:57:14,314 --> 00:57:16,714
- by doing something you want.
- How about this?

1438
00:57:16,774 --> 00:57:19,244
Soo Jin, is there something you want?

1439
00:57:19,374 --> 00:57:20,873
- Do you want to eat anything?
- Ice cream.

1440
00:57:20,874 --> 00:57:23,044
- Ice cream?
- You'll catch a cold.

1441
00:57:23,414 --> 00:57:25,343
What type of ice cream?

1442
00:57:25,344 --> 00:57:27,614
- I want vanilla.
- Vanilla ice cream?

1443
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:29,444
Go outside.

1444
00:57:29,644 --> 00:57:31,943
- There's a market nearby.
- I know.

1445
00:57:31,944 --> 00:57:33,543
- You should go.
- I'll go.

1446
00:57:33,544 --> 00:57:35,974
What else would you like?
I'll buy it for you.

1447
00:57:36,174 --> 00:57:37,714
- Do you want chocolate?
- Ice cream for my siblings.

1448
00:57:37,914 --> 00:57:39,874
She wants ice cream for her siblings too.

1449
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:42,914
- Do you want enough for everyone?
- She's nice.

1450
00:57:43,144 --> 00:57:45,443
How about something everyone can share?

1451
00:57:45,444 --> 00:57:46,743
(They buy ice cream as a thank you.)

1452
00:57:46,744 --> 00:57:48,443
- Okay.
- Look at her hand.

1453
00:57:48,444 --> 00:57:50,543
We should spin the roulette.

1454
00:57:50,544 --> 00:57:52,613
Why don't Tae Hyun spin it?

1455
00:57:52,614 --> 00:57:55,043
- How do I do it?
- Tae Hyun should spin it.

1456
00:57:55,044 --> 00:57:56,443
I'll show you.

1457
00:57:56,444 --> 00:57:58,274
- You should spin it.
- Soo Jin.

1458
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:00,713
- Spin this roulette.
- That's a good idea.

1459
00:58:00,714 --> 00:58:02,513
- Soo Jin.
- I'll hold it for you.

1460
00:58:02,514 --> 00:58:03,713
- Come here.
- Could you hold it?

1461
00:58:03,714 --> 00:58:06,713
Hold it and spin it like this.

1462
00:58:06,714 --> 00:58:08,644
- Spin it like this.
- Can you do it?

1463
00:58:08,714 --> 00:58:10,443
- Try it.
- Practice spinning.

1464
00:58:10,444 --> 00:58:13,043
- Spin it harder.
- Do it harder.

1465
00:58:13,044 --> 00:58:15,974
- In 1, 2, 3.
- This is how you do it.

1466
00:58:16,014 --> 00:58:18,013
- This is how you do it.
- We got it!

1467
00:58:18,014 --> 00:58:21,043
- In 1, 2, 3.
- This is how you do it.

1468
00:58:21,044 --> 00:58:23,613
- We got it.
- We got 100 dollars.

1469
00:58:23,614 --> 00:58:25,494
- That was only practice.
- We got 100 dollars.

1470
00:58:25,774 --> 00:58:27,014
You must say, "Go."

1471
00:58:27,244 --> 00:58:29,014
The staff is always against us.

1472
00:58:29,314 --> 00:58:32,214
Regardless of the broadcast
network, they're always against us.

1473
00:58:32,274 --> 00:58:33,644
Soo Jin, spin it one more time.

1474
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:35,543
Soo Jin, spin it again.

1475
00:58:35,544 --> 00:58:37,544
- Soo Jin, spin it again.
- Do it one more time.

1476
00:58:37,874 --> 00:58:40,174
Spin it one more time. Spin it hard.

1477
00:58:40,244 --> 00:58:41,973
- Spin it hard.
- That's right.

1478
00:58:41,974 --> 00:58:43,444
You're good at spinning.

1479
00:58:43,644 --> 00:58:46,643
- It's an infinite check.
- That's insane.

1480
00:58:46,644 --> 00:58:48,174
You're good at spinning.

1481
00:58:48,644 --> 00:58:50,814
(Soo Jin gets the infinite check.)

1482
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,013
That's insane.

1483
00:58:52,014 --> 00:58:53,114
That's right.

1484
00:58:55,144 --> 00:58:56,873
(They get another infinite check.)

1485
00:58:56,874 --> 00:58:59,743
(It's another shocking result.)

1486
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:01,874
We got another infinite check.

1487
00:59:02,044 --> 00:59:04,643
- My goodness.
- It's infinite check.

1488
00:59:04,644 --> 00:59:07,343
- This is crazy.
- It was 100 dollars before.

1489
00:59:07,344 --> 00:59:09,774
(The harmony of variety shows
brings about a miracle.)

1490
00:59:10,044 --> 00:59:11,444
I get lucky on Running Man.

1491
00:59:11,544 --> 00:59:13,213
I should be on Running Man.

1492
00:59:13,214 --> 00:59:14,214
This is unbelievable.

1493
00:59:14,215 --> 00:59:16,443
- I belong on this show.
- Goodness.

1494
00:59:16,444 --> 00:59:19,113
- This is incredible.
- We got an infinite check.

1495
00:59:19,114 --> 00:59:20,973
- We can't change it.
- No, we can't.

1496
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,644
They should have stopped at 100 dollars.

1497
00:59:23,714 --> 00:59:26,114
- It's incredible.
- Goodness.

1498
00:59:26,374 --> 00:59:28,044
Okay, we got it.

1499
00:59:28,514 --> 00:59:29,944
We're so lucky today.

1500
00:59:30,044 --> 00:59:31,743
- Barbecue grill.
- What do we do?

1501
00:59:31,744 --> 00:59:34,173
We have so many things.

1502
00:59:34,174 --> 00:59:37,144
- I'll go get ice cream.
- Go on.

1503
00:59:38,314 --> 00:59:39,644
This is amazing.

1504
00:59:39,944 --> 00:59:44,243
(Haha runs to the convenience
store for Soo Jin.)

1505
00:59:44,244 --> 00:59:45,513
This and...

1506
00:59:45,514 --> 00:59:46,743
(What will she like?)

1507
00:59:46,744 --> 00:59:49,144
This. How much would this be?

1508
00:59:49,844 --> 00:59:51,714
Thank you. Goodbye.

1509
00:59:52,974 --> 00:59:54,043
Okay.

1510
00:59:54,044 --> 00:59:55,044
(Excited)

1511
00:59:57,044 --> 00:59:59,613
I'm appearing for too long.

1512
00:59:59,614 --> 01:00:01,143
I'm doing too much.

1513
01:00:01,144 --> 01:00:03,113
You should get ready to leave that show.

1514
01:00:03,114 --> 01:00:06,774
There's nothing to cut out.

1515
01:00:06,874 --> 01:00:09,273
My face is appearing too much.

1516
01:00:09,274 --> 01:00:10,813
You're wearing a mask.

1517
01:00:10,814 --> 01:00:13,273
It's someone else that
appears on the other show.

1518
01:00:13,274 --> 01:00:15,643
- Exactly.
- Don't worry.

1519
01:00:15,644 --> 01:00:18,514
- It's okay.
- He's working hard.

1520
01:00:19,714 --> 01:00:21,973
- Here.
- Did you get it?

1521
01:00:21,974 --> 01:00:25,343
It's a mix between
strawberry and chocolate.

1522
01:00:25,344 --> 01:00:27,813
- All right.
- It's totally worth it.

1523
01:00:27,814 --> 01:00:30,174
It's here.

1524
01:00:30,244 --> 01:00:31,743
- Say thank you.
- Thank you.

1525
01:00:31,744 --> 01:00:33,713
- I'm more thankful.
- Thank you.

1526
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:36,343
- I seriously am.
- Enjoy.

1527
01:00:36,344 --> 01:00:38,744
- Bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

1528
01:00:39,244 --> 01:00:40,913
He's my friend.

1529
01:00:40,914 --> 01:00:41,974
Thank you so much.

1530
01:00:42,044 --> 01:00:43,644
- Bye.
- Thank you.

1531
01:00:43,814 --> 01:00:45,974
- Go, Running Man!
- Go!

1532
01:00:46,644 --> 01:00:48,543
- Bye.
- Bye.

1533
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,174
- Thank you.
- All right.

1534
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:52,344
(Their hands are full.)

1535
01:00:52,544 --> 01:00:53,544
My goodness.

1536
01:00:54,014 --> 01:00:55,513
We'll get going.

1537
01:00:55,514 --> 01:00:56,873
(Tiger Mask sees them
off from the balcony.)

1538
01:00:56,874 --> 01:00:59,444
We're leaving. Bye.

1539
01:01:00,714 --> 01:01:02,614
Thank you so much.

1540
01:01:03,244 --> 01:01:04,843
That was amazing.

1541
01:01:04,844 --> 01:01:06,443
I feel so rich.

1542
01:01:06,444 --> 01:01:08,844
- Let's go.
- How can this be possible?

1543
01:01:09,814 --> 01:01:12,273
I'm especially happy because
the baby picked it.

1544
01:01:12,274 --> 01:01:15,044
Right? The baby picked an infinite check.

1545
01:01:15,914 --> 01:01:18,044
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo are
at Jo In Sung's agency.)

1546
01:01:19,344 --> 01:01:20,543
Hello.

1547
01:01:20,544 --> 01:01:21,743
(Why is Lee Kwang Soo here?)

1548
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:23,374
Hello.

1549
01:01:23,444 --> 01:01:24,844
Do you have In Sung's autograph?

1550
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:27,373
(Why is Kwang Soo asking for that?)

1551
01:01:27,374 --> 01:01:30,614
I'm sorry. You must be surprised.

1552
01:01:30,744 --> 01:01:32,544
Hello. Do you have In Sung's...

1553
01:01:33,744 --> 01:01:35,113
Thank you.

1554
01:01:35,114 --> 01:01:36,144
(In Sung left his autograph
for his good friend.)

1555
01:01:36,844 --> 01:01:38,643
We're here. It's on the sixth floor.

1556
01:01:38,644 --> 01:01:42,044
We need to go up to the office.

1557
01:01:42,614 --> 01:01:44,544
Is this it?

1558
01:01:44,714 --> 01:01:46,144
Is this his autograph?

1559
01:01:47,144 --> 01:01:48,743
He left this.

1560
01:01:48,744 --> 01:01:51,743
(Kwang Soo looks like a fanboy.)

1561
01:01:51,744 --> 01:01:53,373
I need his autograph.

1562
01:01:53,374 --> 01:01:54,844
- Hello.
- Hi, Bo Gum.

1563
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:57,714
("Hi, Bo Gum?")

1564
01:01:57,744 --> 01:01:58,774
What are you doing?

1565
01:01:59,544 --> 01:02:01,914
(Park Bo Gum is here.)

1566
01:02:02,374 --> 01:02:05,614
(The most sought-after actor, Park Bo Gum)

1567
01:02:06,044 --> 01:02:08,714
I see. You were here.

1568
01:02:09,174 --> 01:02:11,043
Are you having a meeting? I see.

1569
01:02:11,044 --> 01:02:14,044
Bo Gum, do you have an
extra fridge at home?

1570
01:02:14,744 --> 01:02:16,443
You don't, right? You're
not moving, are you?

1571
01:02:16,444 --> 01:02:18,513
No. Do you need a fridge?

1572
01:02:18,514 --> 01:02:20,644
- Do you have one?
- No.

1573
01:02:21,244 --> 01:02:22,843
Can I have your autograph?

1574
01:02:22,844 --> 01:02:25,474
- Me?
- Do you want mine?

1575
01:02:26,374 --> 01:02:28,444
- I do.
- Okay.

1576
01:02:28,514 --> 01:02:31,814
Bo Gum wants my autograph.
I'll give him one.

1577
01:02:31,974 --> 01:02:34,273
- On your name tag?
- Yes.

1578
01:02:34,274 --> 01:02:36,244
I'm so honored.

1579
01:02:37,114 --> 01:02:39,244
- Like this?
- Yes.

1580
01:02:39,974 --> 01:02:41,543
(It's an honor.)

1581
01:02:41,544 --> 01:02:44,044
- Thank you.
- All right.

1582
01:02:44,144 --> 01:02:46,043
I'll treasure it.

1583
01:02:46,044 --> 01:02:48,344
- Bo Gum.
- This is so precious.

1584
01:02:48,744 --> 01:02:51,914
- Oh, it sticks.
- I don't do this often.

1585
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:55,143
I don't sign my name tag often.

1586
01:02:55,144 --> 01:02:56,314
Thank you.

1587
01:02:56,614 --> 01:02:59,173
Can you give me your autograph?

1588
01:02:59,174 --> 01:03:01,314
- Should I write the date?
- Sure.

1589
01:03:01,514 --> 01:03:03,173
(Kwang Soo got Bo Gum's autograph.)

1590
01:03:03,174 --> 01:03:05,314
- Thank you.
- No problem.

1591
01:03:05,614 --> 01:03:06,944
- Thank you.
- I'll get going.

1592
01:03:07,444 --> 01:03:10,113
Thank you.

1593
01:03:10,114 --> 01:03:11,843
(They even give Kwang Soo drinks.)

1594
01:03:11,844 --> 01:03:14,144
Thank you, Bo Gum. You
didn't have to do this.

1595
01:03:15,114 --> 01:03:17,544
- Thank you.
- I hope you'll win.

1596
01:03:17,644 --> 01:03:19,044
I feel great.

1597
01:03:19,614 --> 01:03:20,743
(He has good friends.)

1598
01:03:20,744 --> 01:03:22,614
I have Joong Ki and Bo Gum's autographs.

1599
01:03:24,444 --> 01:03:27,513
(He won a sofa.)

1600
01:03:27,514 --> 01:03:28,543
Let's go to Gangnam.

1601
01:03:28,544 --> 01:03:31,043
Is there a place that sells
dartboards around Jung Min's place?

1602
01:03:31,044 --> 01:03:32,414
Can you think of any places?

1603
01:03:33,244 --> 01:03:34,574
Dartboards are...

1604
01:03:34,914 --> 01:03:37,543
easy to find at stationery stores.

1605
01:03:37,544 --> 01:03:39,244
Is there a stationery store around there?

1606
01:03:39,344 --> 01:03:41,373
Hello. Do you have a spanner?

1607
01:03:41,374 --> 01:03:43,373
- Do you have a spanner?
- Is this okay?

1608
01:03:43,374 --> 01:03:44,913
It's perfect.

1609
01:03:44,914 --> 01:03:47,343
- We'll return it soon.
- We'll return it.

1610
01:03:47,344 --> 01:03:48,714
Thank you.

1611
01:03:49,644 --> 01:03:52,344
- Done.
- Hold on.

1612
01:03:52,374 --> 01:03:53,614
Just a second.

1613
01:03:54,014 --> 01:03:55,674
I'll take a look.

1614
01:03:55,814 --> 01:03:58,114
I'll take a look in his bathroom.

1615
01:03:58,544 --> 01:03:59,614
How is it?

1616
01:04:01,374 --> 01:04:03,514
(Flushing)

1617
01:04:04,614 --> 01:04:05,643
Just a second.

1618
01:04:05,644 --> 01:04:06,843
(It must be dirty.)

1619
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:09,014
- Don't do anything.
- It's just...

1620
01:04:09,444 --> 01:04:11,874
Give me just a second. This is not okay.

1621
01:04:12,514 --> 01:04:14,344
(Water splashing)

1622
01:04:14,614 --> 01:04:18,244
Is he cleaning the bathroom?

1623
01:04:18,444 --> 01:04:19,744
Are you cleaning?

1624
01:04:20,614 --> 01:04:23,643
I was going to clean the
bathroom if it's dirty,

1625
01:04:23,644 --> 01:04:25,044
but it was very clean.

1626
01:04:25,844 --> 01:04:28,044
The bathroom is here.

1627
01:04:28,714 --> 01:04:29,714
Let's...

1628
01:04:30,044 --> 01:04:32,714
(How do we separate it?)

1629
01:04:35,014 --> 01:04:37,443
Kwang Soo, move.

1630
01:04:37,444 --> 01:04:39,343
How do we do it?

1631
01:04:39,344 --> 01:04:41,373
Hold this and step aside.

1632
01:04:41,374 --> 01:04:43,143
(I'm a bidet expert today.)

1633
01:04:43,144 --> 01:04:45,013
How do we do it?

1634
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:46,444
Hold this.

1635
01:04:47,144 --> 01:04:49,343
(Can you do this?)

1636
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:51,643
How do you separate a bidet?

1637
01:04:51,644 --> 01:04:53,543
(Ji Hyo starts to separate the bidet.)

1638
01:04:53,544 --> 01:04:55,113
How do you know how to do this?

1639
01:04:55,114 --> 01:04:56,343
What are you doing?

1640
01:04:56,344 --> 01:04:58,273
I need to turn off the water.

1641
01:04:58,274 --> 01:04:59,514
- Is it separated?
- Yes.

1642
01:04:59,944 --> 01:05:02,374
- Hold it.
- What's going on?

1643
01:05:03,344 --> 01:05:05,474
She just separated the bidet.

1644
01:05:05,644 --> 01:05:07,744
- Hold it.
- Look at this.

1645
01:05:08,744 --> 01:05:12,814
(Now, she can even separate a bidet?)

1646
01:05:14,174 --> 01:05:16,443
(Thanks to Ji Hyo, they acquired a bidet.)

1647
01:05:16,444 --> 01:05:17,874
Are there dartboards?

1648
01:05:19,444 --> 01:05:20,973
Let's buy them.

1649
01:05:20,974 --> 01:05:22,444
(They're rummaging through
someone else's stuff.)

1650
01:05:22,914 --> 01:05:24,543
We separated the bidet.

1651
01:05:24,544 --> 01:05:26,943
- Can you help me when I move?
- Hey.

1652
01:05:26,944 --> 01:05:29,174
When I move... Right.

1653
01:05:29,374 --> 01:05:31,113
- Here I go.
- Start.

1654
01:05:31,114 --> 01:05:32,643
(It's time to spin the roulette wheel.)

1655
01:05:32,644 --> 01:05:33,774
Do it.

1656
01:05:34,144 --> 01:05:35,244
Go!

1657
01:05:36,174 --> 01:05:39,813
(There's only 10 minutes left.)

1658
01:05:39,814 --> 01:05:44,843
(They need some money to get
dartboards and a claw crane.)

1659
01:05:44,844 --> 01:05:46,043
(100 dollars)

1660
01:05:46,044 --> 01:05:47,244
100 dollars!

1661
01:05:47,874 --> 01:05:49,744
(It's a miracle.)

1662
01:05:50,144 --> 01:05:51,144
100 dollars!

1663
01:05:51,145 --> 01:05:53,973
We won 100 dollars!

1664
01:05:53,974 --> 01:05:55,743
Let's buy dartboards first.

1665
01:05:55,744 --> 01:05:57,414
Where can we buy them?

1666
01:05:57,874 --> 01:06:01,114
Excuse me, is there a
stationery store around here?

1667
01:06:01,544 --> 01:06:03,813
- Can we walk there? Thank you.
- Are we walking?

1668
01:06:03,814 --> 01:06:05,974
Yes, it's right around the corner.
Let's hurry.

1669
01:06:07,114 --> 01:06:08,814
What if they don't have dartboards?

1670
01:06:09,114 --> 01:06:10,574
They must have them.

1671
01:06:11,014 --> 01:06:12,143
We don't have much time.

1672
01:06:12,144 --> 01:06:14,844
Hi, where's the stationery store?

1673
01:06:15,044 --> 01:06:16,543
You'll see a pole.

1674
01:06:16,544 --> 01:06:17,643
- Is it there?
- Yes.

1675
01:06:17,644 --> 01:06:19,674
What if they don't have them?

1676
01:06:19,914 --> 01:06:21,644
Then we're doomed.

1677
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:23,644
- Where is it?
- Where is it?

1678
01:06:23,814 --> 01:06:26,314
- It's there!
- Where?

1679
01:06:26,444 --> 01:06:27,444
(They find a stationery store.)

1680
01:06:27,445 --> 01:06:29,644
It's big. Let's go in.

1681
01:06:30,044 --> 01:06:32,444
- They must have them.
- They have a lot of toys.

1682
01:06:33,044 --> 01:06:36,273
- Excuse me, do you have dartboards?
- Do you have dartboards?

1683
01:06:36,274 --> 01:06:38,643
- Yes, we do.
- Where are they?

1684
01:06:38,644 --> 01:06:40,443
- Over there.
- Let me see.

1685
01:06:40,444 --> 01:06:42,273
It'll be okay.

1686
01:06:42,274 --> 01:06:44,043
(If there are dartboards,
they can just buy them.)

1687
01:06:44,044 --> 01:06:45,444
There it is.

1688
01:06:45,914 --> 01:06:47,174
Here. How much is it?

1689
01:06:48,674 --> 01:06:51,143
It's 17 dollars. Thank you.

1690
01:06:51,144 --> 01:06:53,414
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1691
01:06:53,514 --> 01:06:56,113
We can do this.

1692
01:06:56,114 --> 01:06:57,243
(They acquire a dartboard.)

1693
01:06:57,244 --> 01:06:59,713
You got a dartboard.
Spin the roulette wheel.

1694
01:06:59,714 --> 01:07:01,714
This is our last chance.

1695
01:07:02,144 --> 01:07:04,474
If we don't get an infinite
check, we're doomed.

1696
01:07:04,644 --> 01:07:06,444
- We need an infinite check.
- Let's do this.

1697
01:07:07,144 --> 01:07:08,443
Let's do it together.

1698
01:07:08,444 --> 01:07:10,913
1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

1699
01:07:10,914 --> 01:07:13,974
(Will a miracle happen?)

1700
01:07:15,574 --> 01:07:17,314
This is our last chance.

1701
01:07:17,644 --> 01:07:19,914
If we don't get an infinite
check, we're doomed.

1702
01:07:22,244 --> 01:07:26,144
(Please move one more slot.)

1703
01:07:27,274 --> 01:07:29,674
If we don't get an infinite
check, we're doomed.

1704
01:07:30,214 --> 01:07:31,713
(No way)

1705
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:33,944
You won one dollar.

1706
01:07:34,914 --> 01:07:37,674
Why do we keep getting one dollar?

1707
01:07:37,974 --> 01:07:40,373
- It's...
- Too bad.

1708
01:07:40,374 --> 01:07:42,813
We didn't get any infinite checks.

1709
01:07:42,814 --> 01:07:44,813
It's just one slot before.

1710
01:07:44,814 --> 01:07:47,373
(They failed to acquire a claw crane.)

1711
01:07:47,374 --> 01:07:49,273
Let's just go, Kwang Soo.

1712
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:50,443
(Kwang Soo is unlucky today too.)

1713
01:07:50,444 --> 01:07:53,743
It needed to move just one more slot.

1714
01:07:53,744 --> 01:07:55,784
(Everything except a claw
crane has been acquired.)

1715
01:07:56,144 --> 01:08:00,114
You have brought all the items.

1716
01:08:00,144 --> 01:08:03,514
Among the things you listed,

1717
01:08:03,544 --> 01:08:06,714
you failed to get a claw crane.

1718
01:08:06,844 --> 01:08:09,344
One person will be penalized.

1719
01:08:09,814 --> 01:08:11,774
- It's too harsh.
- But...

1720
01:08:13,474 --> 01:08:16,183
(But?)

1721
01:08:16,184 --> 01:08:17,974
You have a last minute chance.

1722
01:08:19,114 --> 01:08:21,543
- You have a last minute chance.
- Really?

1723
01:08:21,544 --> 01:08:24,213
You can save everyone
from being penalized...

1724
01:08:24,214 --> 01:08:26,643
- and acquire the last item.
- Now, you're talking.

1725
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:28,644
You have a chance to do that.

1726
01:08:28,974 --> 01:08:31,273
- Can you open the bathroom door?
- Okay.

1727
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:35,214
(What is the last chance?)

1728
01:08:37,344 --> 01:08:40,013
It's "Dirty Golfing".
"Dirty Golfing"?

1729
01:08:40,014 --> 01:08:42,113
You sit on the toilet...

1730
01:08:42,114 --> 01:08:44,613
and get the ball in the hole.

1731
01:08:44,614 --> 01:08:47,774
- Sitting on the toilet?
- Only one person gets to try.

1732
01:08:48,544 --> 01:08:51,014
You're given only one chance.

1733
01:08:52,144 --> 01:08:54,244
It's going to be hard.

1734
01:08:54,274 --> 01:08:56,973
(Their fate depends on one try.)

1735
01:08:56,974 --> 01:08:59,043
- Here.
- You have to sit.

1736
01:08:59,044 --> 01:09:01,043
You have to sit.

1737
01:09:01,044 --> 01:09:02,944
But the floor isn't even.

1738
01:09:02,974 --> 01:09:05,013
Where's the hole?

1739
01:09:05,014 --> 01:09:06,713
It's here.

1740
01:09:06,714 --> 01:09:09,144
- It's not impossible.
- Try it.

1741
01:09:09,244 --> 01:09:10,644
Practice.

1742
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,243
It should go this way.

1743
01:09:18,244 --> 01:09:21,214
It has nothing to do with
your golfing skills.

1744
01:09:21,914 --> 01:09:25,344
(The floor is slanted.)

1745
01:09:26,274 --> 01:09:28,873
(In addition...)

1746
01:09:28,874 --> 01:09:31,944
(to the narrow, slated floor...)

1747
01:09:32,814 --> 01:09:34,143
It should go this way.

1748
01:09:34,144 --> 01:09:35,743
My legs are numb.

1749
01:09:35,744 --> 01:09:37,813
You have to put up with it.

1750
01:09:37,814 --> 01:09:38,943
I have to squat.

1751
01:09:38,944 --> 01:09:39,974
My legs are going numb.

1752
01:09:40,044 --> 01:09:41,804
- Why is this here?
- This side is better...

1753
01:09:43,044 --> 01:09:45,944
(Dripping)

1754
01:09:46,214 --> 01:09:48,444
- Come out.
- What are you doing?

1755
01:09:48,814 --> 01:09:50,613
He turned on the water all of a sudden.

1756
01:09:50,614 --> 01:09:52,343
- Come out now.
- You're unbelievable.

1757
01:09:52,344 --> 01:09:54,184
- My goodness.
- Why did you turn on the water?

1758
01:09:54,214 --> 01:09:55,944
- He's not helping.
- Seriously.

1759
01:09:56,374 --> 01:09:58,544
I served with someone like
him in the army. I swear.

1760
01:09:59,044 --> 01:10:00,143
I can't believe this.

1761
01:10:00,144 --> 01:10:01,514
- Get out.
- It's not easy.

1762
01:10:01,874 --> 01:10:04,214
- My socks got wet.
- You're a troublemaker.

1763
01:10:04,344 --> 01:10:06,183
- Jae Seok should try.
- It's not easy.

1764
01:10:06,184 --> 01:10:08,044
- How can we get a hole-in-one?
- It will go over.

1765
01:10:08,114 --> 01:10:11,144
I see. This doesn't come out of its place.

1766
01:10:11,644 --> 01:10:14,844
It's a matter of luck anyway.

1767
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:16,214
Gosh. This is...

1768
01:10:16,314 --> 01:10:18,014
This is not an easy thing to do.

1769
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:20,414
- It won't go in, right?
- It's hard.

1770
01:10:20,444 --> 01:10:22,444
(He focuses the best he can.)

1771
01:10:22,914 --> 01:10:23,973
(It goes in.)

1772
01:10:23,974 --> 01:10:25,044
- He did it.
- Jong Kook.

1773
01:10:25,814 --> 01:10:27,543
(He gets it in, practicing it only twice?)

1774
01:10:27,544 --> 01:10:29,184
- You should do it, Jong Kook.
- You have to do it, Jong Kook.

1775
01:10:29,844 --> 01:10:32,313
(It has to be Jong Kook
who will try this game.)

1776
01:10:32,314 --> 01:10:33,973
- You should do it.
- Let's do it right away.

1777
01:10:33,974 --> 01:10:35,473
- You must do it.
- Challenge!

1778
01:10:35,474 --> 01:10:36,813
- Let's do it now.
- We're going to do it now.

1779
01:10:36,814 --> 01:10:38,743
- Say "Challenge" to start.
- Wait.

1780
01:10:38,744 --> 01:10:40,113
- Challenge!
- Hold on.

1781
01:10:40,114 --> 01:10:42,043
(Jong Kook tries.)

1782
01:10:42,044 --> 01:10:44,843
(Everything depends on his putting.)

1783
01:10:44,844 --> 01:10:47,213
(Please just do what you just did.)

1784
01:10:47,214 --> 01:10:48,214
(He hits it.)

1785
01:10:50,774 --> 01:10:53,914
(Will Jong Kook be able to succeed?)

1786
01:10:56,944 --> 01:10:58,814
(It goes in.)

1787
01:11:00,114 --> 01:11:01,973
(It goes in.)

1788
01:11:01,974 --> 01:11:05,014
(It's a miracle. What a perfect shot!)

1789
01:11:05,974 --> 01:11:09,044
(Jong Kook succeeds at "Dirty Golfing".)

1790
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:12,113
- This is incredible.
- Amazing!

1791
01:11:12,114 --> 01:11:14,274
- He's the best.
- This is splendid.

1792
01:11:14,614 --> 01:11:18,913
(Thanks to his perfect shot, they
are exempted from the punishment.)

1793
01:11:18,914 --> 01:11:21,043
This is crazy. How could
it have possibly gone in?

1794
01:11:21,044 --> 01:11:22,473
(It's a celebratory shot.)

1795
01:11:22,474 --> 01:11:23,813
- You are unbelievable.
- This is beyond my imagination.

1796
01:11:23,814 --> 01:11:25,574
- You are amazing.
- Right.

1797
01:11:25,874 --> 01:11:29,473
You successfully
accomplished the race today.

1798
01:11:29,474 --> 01:11:31,683
No. It's more than that. This is...

1799
01:11:31,684 --> 01:11:33,273
- a complete success!
- A complete success!

1800
01:11:33,274 --> 01:11:34,444
(Congratulations!)

1801
01:11:34,774 --> 01:11:37,414
You even successfully
accomplished the bonus mission.

1802
01:11:37,814 --> 01:11:40,914
- How about the claw machine?
- We will give you the claw machine.

1803
01:11:43,644 --> 01:11:47,143
- Anyway, we succeeded!
- We succeeded!

1804
01:11:47,144 --> 01:11:50,874
(We thank those who appeared on the
show despite their busy schedule.)

1805
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:56,244
(The night deepens at the resting
place of Running Man members.)

1806
01:11:56,974 --> 01:11:59,443
(Spring has returned with...)

1807
01:11:59,444 --> 01:12:01,313
(Jeon So Min, )

1808
01:12:01,314 --> 01:12:02,713
(Lee Se Young, )

1809
01:12:02,714 --> 01:12:03,813
(Park Jin Joo, )

1810
01:12:03,814 --> 01:12:04,814
(Um Ji, )

1811
01:12:04,815 --> 01:12:06,014
(Kang Han Na, )

1812
01:12:06,114 --> 01:12:07,344
(and Choi Tae Joon.)

1813
01:12:08,244 --> 01:12:10,613
(These lovely ladies
show unexpected charms.)

1814
01:12:10,614 --> 01:12:13,574
(It's a spring race of the couples.)

1815
01:12:14,044 --> 01:12:16,844
(They will visit Running Man next week.)
