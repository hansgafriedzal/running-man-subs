(Members will depart on the day of the shooting.)

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,700
(They were half in doubt, and their speculation has become the reality.)

00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,060

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,530
(And today,)

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,060
(these two will accompany the members on their journey...)

18
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,930
(and join Running Man.)

19
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,660

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,030

My goodness.

00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,930
(Opening)

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,230
Hello. Hello.

31
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,160
(It's her first day with Running Man.)

32
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,000
My gosh, look at all the cameras.

(She has changed completely to befit the show.)

36
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,700
(She is a charming woman with a little bit of twist.)

37
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,230
(Jeon So Min is ready to start shooting.)

38
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,700
What's your resolution?

39
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,100
I was told to prepare myself.

40
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,530
So I did, but what's that?

41
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,100
What's that?

42
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,860
(A mysterious set welcomes the newcomer.)

43
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,760
I'm not going to get hit, right?

44
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,500
I'm so scared.

45
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,460
Why is there no one here?

46
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,100
Why is there no one here?

47
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,560
Should I go in?

48
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,360
You can go in.

49
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,660
Why is there no one here?

50
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,500
Do I go in there by myself?

51
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,930
(She repeatedly asks why no one is here.)

52
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,660
(She decides to open the suspicious door.)

53
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,630
(Opening)

54
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,860
My gosh. Hello.

55
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,360
- Hello. - Hello.

56
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,930
- Welcome to Running Man. - Thank you.

57
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,230
I'm scared.

58
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,460
Welcome.

59
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,700
- It's safe, right? - Yes. You can wait over there.

60
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,100
(A luxurious waiting room waited for her.)

61
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,900
- Can I eat this? - Go ahead.

62
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,260
(A luxurious waiting room waited for her.)

63
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,660
I know that you guys aren't usually this nice.

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,000
I've already heard so many things about this show.

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,100
(I heard rumors about you people.)

66
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,200
I heard you guys are bullies. People said that you guys are bullies.

67
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,360
(She's a scary woman who says mean stuff with a smile on her face.)

68
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,160
But why is there no one here?

69
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,860
You'll soon find out why.

70
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,360
(While So Min is being treated luxuriously,)

71
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,200
(a black van enters the site.)

72
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
(Opening)

73
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,660
Hello.

74
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,700
(It's the guy who's always funny.)

75
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,260
Don't you think this set is a bit too much?

76
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,800
(Yang Se Chan also joins as a new member.)

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,930
(He makes everyone laugh whenever he appears on TV.)

78
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,530
(The master of comedy finally joins Running Man.)

79
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,660
(What's this suspicious-looking room?)

80
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,660
- Hey. - Hi, Se Chan.

81
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,830
We're the new members of Running Man.

82
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,360
(I'm not alone any more. It's nice to see you.)

83
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,400
- It's nice to see you. - Se Chan, welcome to Running Man.

84
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,530
You startled me. Nice to see you guys.

85
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,900
(Congratulations on joining Running Man.)

86
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,030
Congratulations.

87
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,100
I thought people mistook us as a couple.

88
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,460
Me too. I was so surprised.

89
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,630
- Here. They said we could eat this. - Really?

90
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,530
(Now, all they have to do is enjoy their luxurious waiting room.)

91
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,260
- They're looking at us funnily. - No, don't worry. It'll be fine.

92
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,260
- They kept looking at me like that. - No.

93
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,500
- How did they look at you? - It looked like...

94
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,830
they knew what was coming for me.

95
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,000
- I even gave you a flower necklace. - He's right.

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,460
I got scared because I thought this would give me an electric shock.

97
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,630
(She must have a lot of misunderstandings about our staff.)

98
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,860
Do you think this is an American variety show?

99
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,330
Why are you so scared? Don't worry.

100
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,070
- Why didn't you eat anything? - The food here? I did.

101
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,930
Eat something. I can't be the only one.

102
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,860
My goodness, I can't believe this. You're incredible.

103
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,100
Fine, I'll eat.

104
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,570
(How will their future unfold?)

105
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,260
- Look. They built a set. - What's that?

106
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,430
It's a new set.

107
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,800
- Hello. - Hello.

108
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,160
Look at the weather.

109
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,070
- The weather is so nice. - It's beautiful.

110
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,000
To celebrate the beginning of spring, we're going to start...

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,460
- a new project for 2017. - Yes!

112
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,530
Here's what the new project for 2017 will be.

113
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,760
It's called Global Race.

114
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,860
- Global? - Global Race?

115
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,630
Until now, you have visited the major parts of our country.

116
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,330
Through Global Race, you'll be running in other countries overseas.

117
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,360
(It's the first step for them to run farther.)

118
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,100
You all know about the new members, right?

119
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,330
- Yes. - Yes. It's So Min...

120
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,360
- 9012! - and Se Chan.

121
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,500
- We are one! - 9012!

122
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,130
- We were one from birth! - Yes!

123
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,930
- 9012! - Forever!

124
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,560
Here are the two new members who'll be joining you for Global Race.

125
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,760
- Welcome, Se Chan and So Min! - Come on out!

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,330
I'm so excited to see So Min...

127
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,000
and Se Chan.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,630
(The door is still closed.)

129
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,860
- They should hurry up and come out. - They're here.

130
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,600
- Are you going to stay there? - Se Chan! So Min!

131
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,560
I think I hear them. Should we go out now?

132
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,660
Yes.

133
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,260
(Shall we slowly show ourselves?)

134
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,600
(What's going on?)

135
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,000
- What's happening? - What? Stop it!

136
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,530
(Why are you doing this to me?)

137
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,060
(The waiting room starts to move.)

138
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,430
(What is the secret behind this waiting room?)

139
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,130
- Aren't they going to come out? - Why aren't they coming out?

140
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,760
- Look! - What's that?

141
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,860
(The excavator pulls the container out.)

142
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,930
Isn't that an excavator?

143
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,700
Gosh, don't do this. Stop it!

144
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,100
Guys!

145
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,530
- My gosh, what's happening? - That's already too high up.

146
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,800
- That's dangerous. - My gosh, what is this?

147
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,330
- Please help us! - So Min!

148
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,160
(The bullies have prepared something for the newcomers.)

149
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,230
- What if this falls? - This is crazy.

150
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,700
It's too high. This is too high!

151
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,700
(Is this really necessary?)

152
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,900
I would've cried if it was me up there.

153
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,360
(We prepared a new kind of high-rise studio for you.)

154
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,760
What is this?

155
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,100
(And...)

156
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,760
(there are 6 ice showers welcoming the members who are on the ground.)

157
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,560
- What's this? - This is water.

158
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,660
- What are you doing? - We're doing this from the start?

159
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,460
- We're supposed to be one. - We're going to get wet already?

160
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,930
Kwang Soo got his hair done today.

161
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,830
What is this? Please explain.

162
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,560
The waiting room that's hanging from the excavator...

163
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,760
is a new mission to welcome the newcomers to the show.

164
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,900
- It's called "Risky Waiting Room". - And?

165
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,560
- They are 15m above the ground. - It's really high up.

166
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,930
- Their mission is to come down. - Okay.

167
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,860
They can use two methods to come down.

168
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,860
- What are they? - What are they?

169
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,360
The first method is...

170
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:41,060
to go down yourselves by using a ladder or a rope.

171
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,330
What did you say?

172
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,630
(You want us to go down ourselves?)

173
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,730
So Min, you were right. They really are bullies.

174
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,000
- What is this nonsense? - The second method is...

175
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,600
The waiting room will descend 3m every time...

176
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,730
- a member gets an ice shower. - My goodness.

177
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,260
They should rappel down.

178
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,000
- They should know how to do that. - This is nothing.

179
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,260
- She's right. It's nothing. - This is for babies.

180
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,830
It's not up to you to decide. It's up to the new members.

181
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,860
If they decide to come down themselves,

182
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,100
no one here will have to receive an ice shower.

183
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,100
My goodness, but how will they come down from there?

184
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,060
So they're the ones who'll be deciding everything?

185
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,860
- Why? - Yes. They're your family now.

186
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,260
They should be grateful that they got picked for the show.

187
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,830
(They should just be quiet and be thankful.)

188
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,530
- Why do we have to go through... - Is he trying to act like a senior?

189
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,330
- My goodness. - No, I'm just saying.

190
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,760
- Why do we have to go through this? - He's so mad.

191
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,360
I think Jong Kook will be the one to get the ice shower.

192
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,000
- You're going to get chosen. - Guys, listen up!

193
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,460
- No, I'm just... - Se Chan, show him!

194
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,930
You guys can jump.

195
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,930
You need to make a good first impression.

196
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,600
Can you please sacrifice yourselves?

197
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,060
No way. What are you saying?

198
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,760
- She's really brazen. - Aren't you scared?

199
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,930
- How can you stand there like that? - Please help us.

200
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,500
Shut it!

201
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,830
"Shut it"?

202
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,560
I didn't say that. It wasn't me.

203
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,200
- I love you too! - They get to decide, right?

204
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,260
- I will always be on your side. - It was Seok Jin!

205
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,260
You guys heard what Jong Kook and Seok Jin said, right?

206
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,060
I'm going to kill you later!

207
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,760
What? Do you want to get killed by an ice shower?

208
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,460
Seok Jin, do you want to get killed by an ice shower?

209
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,530
(What will the newcomers decide to do?)

210
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,170
- Kwang Soo! - Yes?

211
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,860
Would you like an ice shower?

212
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,760
- No! - Then dance for us.

213
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,860
(Then show us your dance moves.)

214
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,460
(If that's what you want)

215
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,060
(I'm your dancing machine.)

216
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,400
- That's not a dance. - He should get wet.

217
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,600
Okay, Kwang Soo. Move to the right.

218
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,330
- He got exempted. - Yes.

219
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,760
- Jong Kook! - Yes?

220
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,300
Do an acrostic poem with So Min's name.

221
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,300
What?

222
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,760
- Fail! - Yes, he failed.

223
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,260
Jong Kook, move to your left.

224
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,530
Okay!

225
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,560
That's great.

226
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,260
(He should experience failure from time to time.)

227
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,430
- Jong Kook will get... - I know I'll get it.

228
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,830
the ice shower. He already knows that.

229
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,430
I'll get hit by an ice shower today, but you'll get hit by me every day.

230
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,760
(You'll get beaten every week.)

231
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,930
- I'll beat you every week. - Se Chan!

232
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,360
- Did you hear what Jong Kook said? - What did he say?

233
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,460
He said he'll beat you after he receives the ice shower.

234
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,170
Jong Kook! You can move to the right!

235
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,260
- Should I go? - Yes, go to the right. I'm sorry.

236
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,760
I should've known better.

237
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,860
- I should've known better. - Okay.

238
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,760
Se Chan knows what he's doing.

239
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,260
So Min wants to say something to Jae Seok.

240
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,260
Please show us your fist dance.

241
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,030
- I can do that for you. It's easy. - It's this dance.

242
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,930
- It's simple. - So Min, you're discriminating.

243
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,460
- This is nothing. - Okay, you can move to the right.

244
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,930
(After a short dance, he gets exempted.)

245
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,930
- Hey, this is unfair. - This is crazy.

246
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,500
- I can do it too. - I can dance too.

247
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,860
(This is so fun.)

248
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,100
Are you satisfied?

249
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,860
That's not enough.

250
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,170
So Min. Se Chan.

251
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,000
Haha, what did you think of me?

252
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,860
To be honest, I like you a lot more than your brother.

253
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,430
Move to your right. That was great!

254
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,160
- Seok Jin! - Yes?

255
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,560
(Seok Jin, you can...)

256
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,630
Go to your left.

257
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,800
(He sends Seok Jin away from the group.)

258
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,300
- Ask me questions. - Just go.

259
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,700
- I can do it too. - That's incorrect.

260
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,800
- Look. - Go over there.

261
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,200
(Seok Jin is desperate.)

262
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,460
Goodness.

263
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,930
- Ji Hyo. - Se Chan.

264
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,260
- Ji Hyo. - Yes?

265
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,730
So Min said you should go this way.

266
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,430
Thank you so much, So Min.

267
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,900
- Seok Jin will get it, won't he? - Thanks!

268
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,800
- Seok Jin should go first. - Really?

269
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,100
- Hey! - Thank you, So Min.

270
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,560
Give me one more chance.

271
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,900
- You don't have another one. - Don't.

272
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,160
Why were you disappointed to see us?

273
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,300
I already knew it from the article.

274
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,130
I was only disappointed in the morning.

275
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,500
- In the morning? - Yes.

276
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,660
Let's go back. We made our decision.

277
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,900
Choose between parachuting and ice shower.

278
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,160
In 3, 2, 1.

279
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,360
- Ice shower. - Ice shower.

280
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,400
Choose one member who will get an ice shower.

281
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,500
(Who will make the sacrifice?)

282
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,960
- Stand under the ice shower. - Do you mean me?

283
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,830
- I mean everyone. - Everyone?

284
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,900
Everyone?

285
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,800
(Will Seok Jin get the ice shower?)

286
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,300
That's a lot of water.

287
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,730
A shower in the beginning is harsh.

288
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,630
Could you consider it one more time?

289
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,900
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

290
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,630
So Min has something to say to you.

291
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,660
Tell me, So Min.

292
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,460
- I'm sorry, Kwang Soo. - For what?

293
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,960
For everything.

294
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,400
- Gosh, for what? - He's scared.

295
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,030
Why are you sorry?

296
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,830
She's sorry for betraying you during the last shoot.

297
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,930
It's completely fine, So Min. Just do better next time.

298
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,900
I'm sorry for everything.

299
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,300
Why are you sorry for everything?

300
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,260
I'm so sorry for everything.

301
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,860
Everything is my fault.

302
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,600
(Why is she apologizing?)

303
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,160
Did they choose parachuting or ice shower?

304
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,560
It's obvious.

305
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,630
Parachuting isn't possible from there.

306
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,600
(Someone has to make a sacrifice.)

307
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,700
What did Se Chan and So Min choose?

308
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,230
- One. - Please.

309
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,800
- Two. - I haven't done anything wrong.

310
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,230
- No way. - Three.

311
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,330
It's me.

312
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,560
(The shower turns on.)

313
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,000
(Seok Jin gets an ice shower.)

314
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,700
(He's happy as long as it isn't him.)

315
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,300
- Congratulations. - I love you.

316
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,130
You wait and see.

317
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,760
- I'm sorry. - Goodness.

318
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,300
I'm sorry, Seok Jin.

319
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,800
Thank you. Please wait for us.

320
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,860
- They're going down. - We're descending 3m.

321
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,060
We're descending.

322
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,630
I feel bad because Seok Jin put on a lot of hair powder today.

323
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,330
The ground became dark.

324
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,100
It's the stage set. I was startled.

325
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,300
- I thought the stage became black. - It's the original color.

326
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,400
I was startled.

327
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,330
They're filling up the water.

328
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,230
(They hope it's Seok Jin again.)

329
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,060
- Are you filling up the water? - Seok Jin.

330
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,800
- Seok Jin. - What are you doing?

331
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,130
Please make your second choice.

332
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,560
Will it be parachuting or ice shower?

333
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,360
(Which will they choose?)

334
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,460
(Will they parachute and make everyone else happy?)

335
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,760
(Or will they make someone get an ice shower?)

336
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,130
Let's make it fun.

337
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,060
Haha.

338
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,100
- Haha is next. - Yes, So Min.

339
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,260
Thank you for buying me meat.

340
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,330
No problem.

341
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,800
I'll always give it to you for free.

342
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,360
Haha, the meat was really delicious.

343
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,560
(Haha, you're awesome.)

344
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,730
I choose Haha.

345
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,100
(Haha gets an ice shower.)

346
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,260
I don't know what to say.

347
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,630
(Didn't she thank him just now?)

348
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,000
- Did you buy the meat? - No, he bought it for me.

349
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,230
Why did you choose Haha then?

350
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,000
We aren't very close.

351
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,060
He still bought you meat.

352
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,300
It was at Haha's restaurant.

353
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,600
- I don't know what to say. - He offered it for free.

354
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,100
Don't you think it's okay since we aren't so close?

355
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,760
It's your choice.

356
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,000
We're in trouble.

357
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,360
What did Se Chan and So Min choose?

358
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,560
In 3, 2, 1.

359
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,000
- What? - That's right.

360
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,500
- Gosh. - Okay.

361
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,030
(Is it me?)

362
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,130
(Haha is chosen for an ice shower.)

363
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,630
- Hey. - Se Chan.

364
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,260
- How could she be so ungrateful? - So Min.

365
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,800
I love you, Se Chan.

366
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,460
- Thank you. - What's the reason?

367
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,230
I'm sorry, Haha.

368
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,030
It's because we aren't close.

369
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,600
Are you close with anyone here?

370
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,130
She's grateful for the meat. She wants to be friends with you.

371
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,930
Thank you, Se Chan.

372
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,630
Don't worry, Jae Seok.

373
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,860
Now that Haha is wet, his sleeves will fit him.

374
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,200
- They shrank. - They became longer.

375
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,100
He can do the Korean mask dance.

376
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,530
- Look. - He should dance.

377
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,160
Aren't they too long?

378
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,700
(This isn't fashionable.)

379
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,900
It looks ridiculous.

380
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,430
- There's Young Jin, Haha's stylist. - Stop it.

381
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,830
- Where is he? - Look at him.

382
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,300
- It's Young Jin. - Young Jin.

383
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,930
He's Haha's stylist.

384
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,930
- Haha dresses exactly like him. - Go away!

385
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,200
- Go home. - He's Haha's muse.

386
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,560
He's Haha's muse.

387
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,300
He's Haha's mentor.

388
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,900
Go inside the car.

389
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,230
Haha dresses exactly like his stylist.

390
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,900
(He copies Young Jin's fashion style.)

391
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,460
(The Waiting Room is 9m above ground.)

392
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,900
- Who was your partner, So Min? - You.

393
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,260
- Who was on your team, Se Chan? - You.

394
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,130
You can depend on us, Kwang Soo.

395
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,500
- Don't pick me. - We'll be on Kwang Soo's side.

396
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,060
(They claim to be on Kwang Soo's side.)

397
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,760
- Really? - Young Kwang Soo.

398
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,200
- Young Kwang Soo. - Let's go.

399
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,930
- Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

400
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,230
- Next is Kwang Soo. - It's Kwang Soo.

401
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,000
- It's Kwang Soo next. - Please don't do it.

402
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,330
He doesn't know. He's the only one who doesn't know.

403
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,000
It's their rule.

404
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,960
When they say, "Don't worry, Kwang Soo,"

405
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,600
they mean he'll get an ice shower.

406
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,860
I don't like this. Don't talk to me.

407
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,700
Don't even call me my name.

408
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,660
They said that it's our rule, but let's break it.

409
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,860
- Okay. - Let's break it.

410
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,330
(Will they break the rule?)

411
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:59,260
Will we get in trouble if we choose Jong Kook?

412
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,660
(What?)

413
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,730
He won't catch a cold because he's healthy.

414
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,130
Catching a cold isn't what's important.

415
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,660
He won't catch a cold because he exercises a lot.

416
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,870
The other members are older.

417
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,260
It's okay to choose Jong Kook since he's physically fit.

418
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,760
(It's a big risk.)

419
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,870
Listen to me first.

420
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,700
Why am I being persuaded by you?

421
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,560
I feel like that's what's happening.

422
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,160
Shall we go for it?

423
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,830
(Will they take a risk?)

424
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:30,800
(Will they take the risk and choose Jong Kook?)

425
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,530
I feel bad for him, but let's do it.

426
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,630
(Is it a thoughtless decision?)

427
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,870
Whom will you choose?

428
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,330
In 3, 2, 1.

429
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,000
- Jong Kook. - Jong Kook.

430
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,530
(They choose Jong Kook.)

431
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,870
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

432
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,700
- We're on your side. - You're the best.

433
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,900
Let's go, Kwang Soo.

434
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,800
- It's you. - Why are you cheering for me?

435
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,060
(No news is good news.)

436
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,460
- I mean it. - Kwang Soo.

437
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,930
Stop it.

438
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,800
(He doesn't trust them.)

439
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,230
(Everyone wants it to be Kwang Soo.)

440
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,260
- It's not me. - It's definitely you.

441
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,430
Gosh, what should we do? I'm scared of Jong Kook.

442
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,400
Gosh, I'm scared of him.

443
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,000
So Min had her eyes on Kwang Soo.

444
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,560
I thought they would choose him first today.

445
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,660
Seriously.

446
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,960
So Min had her eyes on Kwang Soo the most.

447
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:22,500
Kwang Soo, why did you betray me last time?

448
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,700
I didn't betray you.

449
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,160
So Min betrayed you.

450
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,930
(It was So Min.)

451
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,760
It wasn't me. It was So Min.

452
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,400
I'll change my mind.

453
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,900
- What? - Shall I change my mind?

454
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,430
(Will she change her mind?)

455
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,730
(Will you?)

456
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,660
Do you want to get an ice shower?

457
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,500
(It's a struggle between the powerful and the powerless.)

458
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,000
Shall we change or not?

459
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,400
- Change it. - Say it in three seconds.

460
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,800
Don't change it.

461
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,630
Don't change it? Okay, stay there.

462
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,830
- Change it. - Change it?

463
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,030
- Change it? - Change it?

464
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,100
- Are you sure? - Darn it.

465
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,600
- Shall we change it? You decide. - Hey!

466
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,200
- In 3, 2, 1. - 2, 1.

467
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,130
(What will Kwang Soo choose?)

468
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,760
(Kwang Soo usually makes bad choices.)

469
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,760
(If he doesn't change it, Jong Kook will get an ice shower.)

470
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,800
(What will be Kwang Soo's answer?)

471
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,960
(He spits.)

472
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,960
Gosh. Hey.

473
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,700
How old are you?

474
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,830
Goodness.

475
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,930
(How dare they test him?)

476
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,460
Change it.

477
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,830
- Change it? - Change it?

478
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,560
He told us to change.

479
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,700
(Did he make the right decision?)

480
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,330
What's going on?

481
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,370
They'll change.

482
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,630
- Didn't they choose Kwang Soo? - Maybe not.

483
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,260
- He told us to change. - He did.

484
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,930
It's unfortunate. I wasn't going to choose Kwang Soo.

485
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:40,130
I also chose him at first, but we have no choice now.

486
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,900
- Cover this side of your face. - In 1, 2.

487
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,230
- Kwang Soo. - We choose Kwang Soo.

488
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,500
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

489
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,030
- We changed our mind as you told. - We did what you told us.

490
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,400
- Did you change it? - Yes.

491
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,370
- We changed because you told us. - Listen up.

492
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,000
Here's the person to get an ice shower.

493
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,660
(Who is it this time?)

494
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,900
It's Kwang Soo.

495
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,800
(Kwang Soo gets an ice shower.)

496
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,630
(How dare they?)

497
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,730
It was so obvious.

498
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,160
- You told us to change. - Thank you.

499
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,130
- Kwang Soo. - Thank you.

500
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,200
- You told them to change. - You told us to change.

501
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,260
- Wasn't it me? - No, it wasn't.

502
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,930
- It wasn't? - No.

503
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,370
Who was it?

504
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,000
It was Jong Kook.

505
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,530
- Jong Kook? - It was Jong Kook at first.

506
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,830
- Me? - That's great.

507
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,800
You told them to change it.

508
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,060
Am I next?

509
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,930
No, we'll change it.

510
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,530
My goodness.

511
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,030
They have us in their hands.

512
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,630
Let's go once more.

513
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,530
Let's go for two people at once.

514
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,200
- Right. - This is easier.

515
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,700
- Choose 2. - You'll descend 6m.

516
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,130
Okay, Se Chan.

517
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,000
- That's right. - I choose Kwang Soo.

518
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,800
- It's okay. - Will you choose two?

519
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,060
You can choose the same person.

520
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,560
- You can choose the same person. - I recommended you.

521
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,370
- Okay. - Everyone knows that.

522
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,930
- Everyone does. - Okay, Jong Kook.

523
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,600
I recommended you immediately.

524
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,660
- Thank you, Jong Kook. - You're welcome.

525
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,930
Jong Kook is the best.

526
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,600
They can parachute down.

527
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,630
Whom shall we choose?

528
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,930
Please choose again.

529
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,660
(It's time to choose the 4th victim.)

530
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,500
Should we choose Kwang Soo and ask him again?

531
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,060
- Kwang Soo? - Yes.

532
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,400
- Let's cover our mouths. - He just looked at us.

533
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,000
In 1, 2, 3.

534
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,160
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

535
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,030
(Worried)

536
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,370
We have to choose between Jong Kook and Jae Seok.

537
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,460
(They'll choose one more person.)

538
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,800
- It's hard. - It's so hard.

539
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,330
(The scary one or the national celebrity?)

540
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,430
Kwang Soo, should we change our minds or not?

541
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,430
- What? - Should we change our minds?

542
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,100
Don't change your minds.

543
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,460
Don't.

544
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,800
Don't.

545
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,000
- No? - Why are you doing this to me?

546
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,500
I've already been splashed.

547
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,530
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

548
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,660
They're taming you right now.

549
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,870
Guys!

550
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:46,730
I can see that Se Chan and So Min look down on you.

551
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,900
You guys are the youngest.

552
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,660
I've been the youngest for the past seven years.

553
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,800
- You were not our youngest member. - Who is it then?

554
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,030
It was Seok Jin.

555
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,300
- Really? - You didn't know?

556
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,200
- I didn't. Now, it makes sense. - Now, you know.

557
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,600
- I always thought you were so cute. - Right?

558
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,130
- Seok Jin ages backwards. - Really.

559
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,000
Seok Jin is so immature.

560
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,930
- That's right. - You didn't know?

561
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,230
Should we change our minds?

562
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,560
- Don't. - What?

563
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,630
- Do whatever you want. - Don't change your minds.

564
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,900
- No? - No.

565
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,200
He says no.

566
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,730
(The new members are playing around with Kwang Soo.)

567
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,160
The decision has been made.

568
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,360
(It's time for the 4th ice shower.)

569
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,760
We've chosen two people this time.

570
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,760
- All right. - Okay.

571
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,030
That sounds good.

572
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,300
(Kwang Soo has no idea.)

573
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,630
Two people will be splashed with water.

574
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,300
One, two...

575
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,360
I bet it's Jae Seok.

576
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,460
- Three. - I agree.

577
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,460
- Okay. - What?

578
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,500
(Splash)

579
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,260
I bet it's Jae Seok.

580
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,230
(Is it Jong Kook or Jae Seok?)

581
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,700
(Splash)

582
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,130
(Bye, guys.)

583
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,500
(See you on the ground.)

584
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,030
What happened?

585
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,300
It was Jong Kook.

586
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,760
This is nice.

587
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,500
(Thanks, new members.)

588
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,430
- I'm sorry. - Are you okay?

589
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,060
- Oh, my. - I'm sorry.

590
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,760
I'm so glad...

591
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,930
- you're here. - Look who is here.

592
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,830
You can come down now.

593
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,230
- Come down. - Please cover me.

594
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,760
- Oh, my. - Come down.

595
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,830
Come out.

596
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,060
I won't be able to like them.

597
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,360
- They're here. - Lay him down.

598
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,000
- Se Chan. - Hello.

599
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,060
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

600
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,960
I'm sorry.

601
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,560
- Wait. - I'm sorry, Jong Kook.

602
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,130
(The members welcome them first then force them out.)

603
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,560
- No! - Catch them.

604
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,630
What are you doing?

605
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,860
- Press the button. - What are you doing?

606
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,160
- Let us welcome you. - I have no extra clothes.

607
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,500
- I have no other clothes. - It'll be fine.

608
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,160
- It'll be all right. - Come here.

609
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,500
- It'll be okay. - I have no other clothes.

610
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,830
It's going to hurt.

611
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,530
It's going to hurt.

612
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,800
Press the button. Seok Jin, press the button.

613
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,200
Don't do it!

614
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,230
(Splash)

615
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,900
(Once you're in, you can't get out.)

616
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,030
(The welcoming ceremony is over.)

617
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,560
Party time!

618
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,730
We have new members.

619
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:06,060
Please welcome Se Chan and So Min.

620
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,460
Hello.

621
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,260
Se Chan.

622
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,430
- Well... - So Min.

623
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:14,260
- Let me talk about So Min. - So Min.

624
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,830
- Recently, she betrayed Kwang Soo. - Right.

625
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,060
Many viewers loved it.

626
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,360
We've never had a female betrayer.

627
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,700
- I'm not a betrayer. - Actually, we've been wondering...

628
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,260
who will be the next betrayer.

629
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,800
- I didn't expect it to be a girl. - Right.

630
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,460
As Jong Kook said, we now have a female betrayer.

631
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,200
- It's refreshing. - It is.

632
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,300
It's very refreshing.

633
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,360
- It's good news. - You're right.

634
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,830
Please welcome Se Chan too.

635
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,830
Hello.

636
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,030
Se Chan did an amazing job...

637
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,700
every time he appeared on Running Man.

638
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,060
- He blended in very well. - He did a great job.

639
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,330
I like him so much.

640
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:50,100
- I heard he recommended me. - I strongly recommended you.

641
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,160
Really?

642
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,730
I put as much effort as I put into my workouts.

643
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:55,330
It almost worked against you.

644
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,730
- It almost did. - I recommended you too strongly.

645
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,960
You must have made a fuss.

646
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,900
If you had been quiet, it would have gone more smoothly.

647
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,360
They thought you bribed me.

648
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,160
(Suspicious connection between Jong Kook and Se Chan)

649
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,030
- I recommended you so strongly. - Don't do that from now on.

650
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,360
I shouldn't.

651
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:13,500
Se Chan and So Min joined us.

652
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,960
As the producer said,

653
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,260
Running Man is starting over...

654
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,560
from this episode.

655
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,700
This is a very important time for us.

656
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,460
- You're right. - If we fail, we'll blame those two.

657
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,160
That's great.

658
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,100
- Guys. - I feel so relieved.

659
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,730
We'll give you guys an excuse.

660
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,160
Don't worry. If we fail, we'll all fail together.

661
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,860
- Not just us? - No.

662
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,060
- Don't worry. - Don't worry.

663
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,860
With the new members,

664
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,600
let's start Global Race.

665
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,260
- What's Global Race? - Are we going abroad?

666
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,360
Spring is here. Many television shows...

667
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,800
and people around us go on trips abroad.

668
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,860
- They do. - You're right.

669
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,260
- So many do that. - We've decided...

670
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,500
to send some of you...

671
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,760
on a trip abroad.

672
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,930
(Are we going abroad?)

673
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,530
- How many? - Only some of us?

674
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,160
Not all of you can go.

675
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,300
- I see. - I see.

676
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,530
We'll decide who will go through the race.

677
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,460
I'll show you the places you'll be visiting.

678
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,200
- Okay. - Please look at the screen.

679
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,230
What are the places?

680
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,430
(Hawaii)

681
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,000
(A paradise on the Earth, Hawaii)

682
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,230
Hawaii?

683
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,830
(Are we really going there?)

684
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,060
- I really want to go. - Seriously?

685
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,100
Hawaii.

686
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,430
(They've never been this eager before.)

687
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:31,030
(Beautiful sunshine and sparkling ocean)

688
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,100
(Dangerous tourist attractions)

689
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,760
What do you mean by dangerous tourist attractions?

690
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,530
Look at that.

691
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,730
(What's going on?)

692
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,660
(Dangerous tourist attractions?)

693
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,760
(You've never experienced a sea like this.)

694
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,230
(Shark cage diving)

695
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,360
- That looks scary. - That's so scary.

696
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,630
- We can't do that. - Are you out of your mind?

697
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,400
We can't do that.

698
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,100
(See you soon.)

699
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,760
(Australia)

700
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,800
(Are they crocodiles?)

701
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,830
- They're crocodiles. - Gosh.

702
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,630
It says, "Experience crocodiles."

703
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,860
I can't do that.

704
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,230
I can't trust the cage.

705
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,560

00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,930
- I can't do that. - My goodness.

709
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,230
I can't do that.

710
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,060
- That's too high. - It's a zipline.

711
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,830
That's crazy.

712
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,560
(Indonesia)

713
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,900
That's an active volcano.

714
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,430
Why would we go there?

715
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,330
Isn't that a fiery pit?

716
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,130
(A volcano tour in Indonesia)

717
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,730
Are you planning to terminate the show?

718
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,930
(Is this the last episode?)

719
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,860
It seems like...

720
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,860
- What's that? - That's not okay.

721
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,700
- That's not okay. - We shouldn't do this.

722
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,460
(Japan)

723
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,800
The whole building is haunted.

724
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,500
- Ghosts appear. - Ghosts appear.

725
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,760
It's included in Guinness World Records.

726
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,900
Really?

727
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,500
I won't be able to sleep for six months.

728
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,900
(Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear in Japan)

729
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,860
(New Zealand)

730
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,560
- I can't do that. - This is not okay.

731
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,730
My goodness.

732
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,830
(It's 160m high.)

733
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,760
- What's that? - That's not okay.

734
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,960
- What's that? - How will we do that?

735
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,860
Why has the show changed so suddenly?

736
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,530
Do you mean that it'll be the end of us?

737
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,960
Why does it say "the end"?

738
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,760
- Oh my. - That's...

739
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,000
That's too much.

740
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,060
You've just seen...

741
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,830
tourist attractions that many people wish to visit...

742
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,300
- You're lying. - before they die.

743
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,760
Who wants to go to those places?

744
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,860
Why do you have to do this right after we join?

745
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,960
You won't visit all of the places you've just seen.

746
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,300
Each of you will win points as you clear the missions.

747
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,000
- Points? - Is it an individual game?

748
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,100
Each week, the member with the lowest score...

749
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,560
will get a Tour Sticker.

750
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,960
The one who accumulates 3 stickers 1st...

751
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,300
will have to visit...

752
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,560
one of the places.

753
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,800
That's too harsh.

754
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,130
You must have wanted us to do our very best.

755
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,630
Briefcases, please.

756
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,730
- What? - What?

757
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,060
(It feels dangerous.)

758
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,130
Why are there only six of them?

759
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,100
In the briefcases are...

760
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,760
two No Tour Cards,

761
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,260
two Solo Tour Cards,

762
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,630
and two Couple Tour Cards.

763
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:22,230
You'll exclude briefcases one by one.

764
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,700
The one with the lowest score...

765
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,100
will choose one briefcase among the remaining ones.

766
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,560
There's no choice.

767
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,430
We shouldn't exclude No Tour Cards.

768
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,760
We should exclude the right ones.

769
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,730
- I'm confused. - Now,

770
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,260
Se Chan and So Min will...

771
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,900
exclude two briefcases.

772
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,830
- Do a good job. - There are only two No Tour Cards.

773
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,630
Do a good job.

774
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,830
So Min is usually lucky.

775
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,800
(Will she turn out to be lucky?)

776
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,100
Exclude a Solo Tour Card.

777
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,630
(She's examining the briefcases.)

778
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,200
(She chooses number 3 without hesitation.)

779
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,100
- Good job. - She's so brave.

780
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,160
Se Chan, go.

781
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,730
They must have put a lot of thought in it.

782
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,030
Exactly. Do some analysis.

783
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,900
Those who think a lot usually get in trouble.

784
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,700
(Se Chan is thinking hard.)

785
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,060
Four.

786
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,060
Four is usually associated with bad things.

787
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,800
(He believes briefcase number 4 has a bad card.)

788
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,060
People these days don't believe in that.

789
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,430
(Se Chan chooses number 4 after thinking carefully.)

790
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,030
- Okay. - I choose number four.

791
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,200
Let's open So Min's briefcase.

792
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,160
- Please. - I hope she'll bring us good luck.

793
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,060
- It's important. - I hope she's lucky.

794
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,900
(Please eliminate a bad card.)

795
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,660
- It's a Solo Tour Card. - Okay.

796
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,960
(A Solo Tour Card is excluded.)

797
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,100
Good job.

798
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,730
- It's excluded now. - Good job.

799
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,230
- Good job, So Min. - Is it a good thing?

800
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,060
- It's a very good thing. - Really? Is it?

801
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,400
- You're so lucky. - You brought us good luck.

802
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,930
So Min is lucky. So Min is so lucky.

803
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,960
The staff members are shocked.

804
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,030
They're taken aback.

805
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,200
(What's in Se Chan's briefcase?)

806
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,500
(Will his analysis pay off?)

807
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,400
- Except Solo Tour Card... - Is he unlucky?

808
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,930
(Will his analysis pay off?)

809
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,360
- What's in it? - Guys.

810
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,360
I'm sorry.

811
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,260
(One No Tour Card is taken away.)

812
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,530
- I picked a No Tour Card. - You two are complete opposite.

813
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,300
They did put a bad card in this fourth briefcase.

814
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,330
(He's a new unlucky guy.)

815
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:14,100
- There are no exceptions here. - He's really unlucky.

816
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,530
- He should've picked the 6th one. - Or the 1st.

817
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,300
Jae Seok. Then get the sixth briefcase.

818
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,300
- Can I? - Sure. We'll switch them later.

819
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,360
- Can I choose one then? - Sure. Go ahead.

820
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,200
(Jae Seok, known as the unlucky guy, tries.)

821
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,000
- Goodness. Hey. - Let's see it.

822
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,260
(He's confident today. What will be in the 6th briefcase?)

823
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,530
Lately, I am not that unlucky.

824
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,860
I had a hunch that he should have picked the sixth briefcase.

825
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,760
I am 100 percent certain there will be a No Tour Card.

826
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,930
(Of course.)

827
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,730
- You never pick something useful. - I knew it.

828
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,000
(Why do you get your hopes up?)

829
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,300
- Why did you pick on me? - Goodness.

830
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,630
- You are also unlucky. - That's what he picked.

831
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,430
- You are truly unfortunate. - I guess I am really unlucky.

832
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,000
(His reputation is everlasting.)

833
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
The new Running Man's project...

834
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,730
is a Global Race joined by new members of the program.

835
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,200
(Global Race)

836
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,530
(With 3 Solo Tour Cards, one can go on a trip.)

837
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,400
(Who will be chosen?)

838
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,000
(Global Race)

839
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:02,800
(They are heading to the next dangerous place.)

840
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,200
- Kwon Ryeol. I have to buy that. - Congratulations.

841
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,700
All right. We will set out now.

842
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,300
(They sit where they want to sit.)

843
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:13,000
- You are all seated. - Yes, we are.

844
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,030
Is there anyone who wants to switch seats?

845
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,330
Is there anyone who wants to switch seats?

846
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,700
- Why? - Does our seats play a role?

847
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,830
Are you up to something?

848
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,000
We are going to do something while we move to our next place.

849
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,100
Our seats must mean something.

850
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,330
(Why does he want our seats switched?)

851
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,130
- I like my seat. - I want to change my seat.

852
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,260
So Min. Come here.

853
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,030
- Go away. - How can you just sit here?

854
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,160
- Why are you here? - We can't continue with our show.

855
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,700
(Their first instinct is to switch first.)

856
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,730
- There's no room! - Ji Hyo!

857
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,330
- Hold on. - We are all set.

858
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,360
Can you move?

859
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,200
- Four people can sit in the back. - Exactly.

860
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,200
Jae Seok. You should sit up front since you are like our captain.

861
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,430
Okay. Fine. I will sit here then.

862
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,100
- I will accept your recommendation. - Kwang Soo. Sit here.

863
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:58,060
Why don't we put all the unlucky members in one team?

864
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,300
(Observation 1: Kwang Soo can't look So Min in the eye.)

865
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,000
Do you remember how you pushed me before?

866
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,730
You pushed me, but you are not pushing Jae Seok.

867
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:10,360
(Observation 2: He picks a fight with Se Chan for nothing.)

868
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,060
(Then does it mean...)

869
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,260
Kwang Soo, do you have feelings for So Min?

870
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,360
- It's not that. - Stop chasing her.

871
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,830
As I told you before, So Min doesn't have the slightest interest in you.

872
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,630
- Don't flirt with her. - Jae Seok, the feelings are mutual.

873
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:26,460
She and I were never each other's love interests.

874
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,430
You seem to like other women though.

875
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,160
- What do you mean? - He liked every female guest.

876
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,330
- On every episode... - He does really like them.

877
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,530
He has never looked at me the same way.

878
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,660
I don't have feelings for you. What can I do?

879
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,100
(He falls in love with the touch of their hands.)

880
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,730
(But with So Min, he didn't fall in love. Rather, he bickered with her.)

881
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,360
- Really? - You are just a good colleague.

882
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,530
- I still don't feel that way. - Are you certain?

883
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,630
- You are all seated, right? - Yes. What is it?

884
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,230
By the location of your seats,

885
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,300
So Min, Kwang Soo, Se Chan, and Jae Seok will make one team.

886
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,930
- The seats did matter. - Just like this?

887
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,230
So this is our team?

888
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,730
Goodness. I already have two traitors on my team.

889
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:08,130
- They are more likely to betray us. - Jae Seok. You have three.

890
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,830
(He's a super rookie in the world of betrayals.)

891
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:14,300
The worst thing about Se Chan is that he's the new unlucky traitor.

892
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,700
(Se Chan, a symbol of misfortune)

893
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,900
- He has all the negative aspects. - No, I am not. I am not unlucky.

894
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,730
- You are full of misfortunes. - No, I am not.

895
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,030
No, I won't betray. I trust you.

896
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,530
Why did they use people?

897
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,200
- So Min. - Yes?

898
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,330
- You just told your first lie. - Goodness.

899
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,730
(She's getting ready to betray.)

900
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:33,200
- This is your problem. - You're making me mad.

901
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,330
- Are you preparing to betray me? - No, I am not.

902
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,130
- Don't backhit me. - I won't.

903
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,900
- Did you mean "backstab"? - "Backhit"?

904
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,700
I didn't mean to.

905
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,830
- Are you trying to picking on him? - I am.

906
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,460
- He wants to be involved. - It's because I have to show...

907
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,330
- them this is a tough show. - He wants to join the fun.

908
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,430
He's being mean to the new members.

909
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:51,430
He is the baby of that team.

910
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:53,200
Hey, our baby.

911
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,160
- Goodness. Aren't you a cutie? - Good boy.

912
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,530
(Seok Jin still suffers.)

913
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,200
- Jong Kook is the team leader. - Gosh.

914
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,830
Se Chan was sitting here before.

915
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:06,160
We will start the mission now.

916
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,430
The mission is "Nonsense Quiz".

917
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,560
(The second mission is "Nonsense Quiz".)

918
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,360
- What is that? - It will be 4 on 4.

919
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,330
Members from the winning team will earn points individually.

920
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,030
Right. This will be played individually.

921
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:24,800
You have to respond to the questions with unrelated answers.

922
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,800
If you give unrelated answers three times in a row, it's a success.

923
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,530
The team with more members who succeed is the winning team.

924
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,700
The winning team will earn 1 point. The losing team will lose 1 point.

925
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,460
- We're good at this. - Seok Jin.

926
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,830
Can we talk nonsense or does it have to make a bit of sense?

927
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,000
- You can talk nonsense. - Really? Okay.

928
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,100
Seok Jin has the upper hand in this game.

929
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,360
He usually talks nonsense.

930
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,300
(That jerk...)

931
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,730
- He does. - He doesn't make sense.

932
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,900
It's true indeed.

933
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,900
I don't remember when I last had a proper conversation with him.

934
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,930
- He doesn't put any effort into it. - Wait. I'm going to hit you today.

935
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,300
Stop hitting him.

936
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,530
He really talks a lot of nonsense.

937
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,930
Which team will go first?

938
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,430
- Our team will. - Okay. They can go first.

939
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,830
- Will you go first, Seok Jin? - You can start with Seok Jin.

940
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,300
Start. What did you do when you woke up today?

941
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,300
Lion.

942
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,530
- What are you doing? - What?

943
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,700
- What are you doing? - What?

944
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,930
- Wrong. - Come on.

945
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,430
So this is how you play.

946
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,830
Now, I figured it out.

947
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,700
Seok Jin. I told you we should play after we see them play!

948
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,930
- You can't do that now. - I get it now.

949
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,230
(We can call this Seok Jin's game.)

950
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,230
- He's out. He failed. - If you ask that question...

951
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,100
- He failed. - No, I didn't.

952
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,230
- If you hesitate, you fail. - The questions are not specific.

953
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,100
- The range of questions is wide. - Here we go.

954
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,030
Ji Hyo. Get ready.

955
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,630
Start. What is in your refrigerator?

956
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,830
I'm hungry.

957
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,630
- What is your wish? - I am sleepy.

958
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:47,300
- What do you want to do now? - I want to sleep.

959
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,800
(You want to sleep? That makes sense!)

960
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,270
- Why? - You want to sleep?

961
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,230
(Ji Hyo fails.)

962
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,160
(I just told you my specialty.)

963
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,660
- I want to sleep. - That made sense.

964
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,730
- What's wrong with that? - You said...

965
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,730
- you want to sleep. - But you don't want to.

966
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:03,460
- That's what she wanted to do. - We agree. We admit her mistake.

967
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,900
- You did want to sleep, right? - Ji Hyo failed.

968
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,800
- Both of them failed? - Haha. It's your turn.

969
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,600
- You were close though. - Goodness.

970
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,360
Start. Which member is your favorite?

971
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,630
Raise my fee.

972
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,460
- What is your phone's wallpaper? - My house is ruined.

973
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,730
- What do you want from me? - My second child was just born.

974
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,630
- He succeeded. - Great.

975
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,830
(Haha is the first to succeed.)

976
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,000
All right.

977
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,660
This is really nervous.

978
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,930
It goes so fast.

979
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,160
- Get ready. - Have your answers ready.

980
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,430
Start. What is your motto?

981
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,830
The weather is very nice.

982
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:34,930
What do you want to say now?

983
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:38,460
- When will you fix me a date? - What?

984
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,700
(Jong Kook fails.)

985
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,300
"What do you want to say now?"

986
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,530
- His answer made sense. - Why did you say that?

987
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:47,100
- I didn't know. It does make sense. - Goodness, Jong Kook.

988
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,630
Your answer should have been something like "red".

989
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,530
- Let's do it again now. - Why would we do that?

990
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,330
(I could have just said anything.)

991
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,230
- Jong Kook fails. - Great. We can do this!

992
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,900
(Only Haha succeeded.)

993
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,160
- It's not that. - Let's be clear on this topic.

994
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,900
- You must be really lonely. - I think he meant it.

995
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,930
- I meant it. - I guess so.

996
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,130
- What is your ideal type? - What do you mean?

997
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,430
He likes tanned women with thick thighs.

998
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:11,160
No, that's not true. That's not my ideal type.

999
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,130
- Isn't that Hyo Lyn? - I don't know my type.

1000
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,270
- Hyo Lyn it is! - Yes!

1001
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,270
(That's correct!)

1002
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,800
(Here is your other half.)

1003
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,630
- I don't have an ideal type. - It must be Hyo Lyn.

1004
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,660
- She's the Beyonce of Korea. - I have no standards about looks.

1005
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,130
Really. I don't have them anymore.

1006
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,200
(Don't lie.)

1007
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,100
- That's not true. - You're lying.

1008
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,270
Let's see whom you marry.

1009
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:32,430
I really don't have any standards about looks now.

1010
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,800
- It's our turn. You saw it, right? - All right.

1011
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,830
(I'm going to be in charge of the xylophone.)

1012
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,360
- Here we go. - Wait.

1013
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,830
- Give it back. - Why?

1014
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:44,300
- I'm going to do it. - But it's your team's turn.

1015
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,630
- He hosted "Star Golden Bell". - Stop it.

1016
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,160
- You are not the only host! - What did you say?

1017
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,900
Have you ever hosted "Star Golden Bell"?

1018
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,300
(Seok Jin, the legendary host and the ruler of xylophones)

1019
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,800
I am a host too!

1020
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,000
I am a better host!

1021
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,900
- I agree with you on that point. - He has experience.

1022
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,270
(I haven't touched a xylophone in ages.)

1023
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,730
- All right. - I'll go first. Watch and learn.

1024
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:06,430
- So Min. Kwang Soo. Watch me. - Only two of us have to succeed.

1025
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,730
- I will copy you. - All of us could have succeeded.

1026
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:12,360
Don't give a long answer just because the question is long.

1027
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,830
- Keep them short. - Watch how I do this. Observe.

1028
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:21,360
(Jae Seok seems unusually confident. Will he succeed?)

1029
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,300
- Who is your role model? - Poop.

1030
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,030
(Poop is his role model?)

1031
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,830
- Hold on! It makes sense. - It makes sense!

1032
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:35,000
- Poop is his role model. - It's true. He failed.

1033
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,230
(Did Jae Seok fail?)

1034
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,130
- His role model is indeed poop. - Hey.

1035
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:41,230
He told me that his role model is diarrhea in 2017.

1036
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:44,230
Before shooting, he did confess that his role model is poop.

1037
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,700
Besides, he's unlucky as poop.

1038
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:51,560
(Was he unlucky since he was trying to take after his role model?)

1039
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,200
I am always unlucky.

1040
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,430
- Hey, how can it be my role model? - Right.

1041
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,730
- It is completely true. - You said your true role model.

1042
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,830
I thought whatever the question was, poop wouldn't make sense.

1043
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,630
(This is how he got a fragrant role model.)

1044
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:04,900
- It did somehow make sense. - Didn't it make sense though?

1045
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,900
- Pull yourself together. Se Chan. - I will.

1046
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,400
Start. Which part of your body itches?

1047
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,530
My knee hurts.

1048
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,900
- What is your nickname? - I am a strawberry.

1049
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,230
(Is Strawberry your nickname?)

1050
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,270
(Se Chan fails because it makes so much sense.)

1051
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:21,830
- Why did you say that? - Is your nickname Strawberry?

1052
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,630
- It is not. - Is it Strawberry?

1053
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,330
- Why did you say Strawberry? - Come on.

1054
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,930
- He is just like his brother. - He is.

1055
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:30,200
- He's just like Se Hyung. - We are brothers.

1056
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,730
Your brother lost every game on Saturday.

1057
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,830
Don't badmouth my brother. He's good at games.

1058
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:37,060
Don't you dare look down on my brother.

1059
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,060
- I won't let you live. - How heartwarming.

1060
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,800
- Don't bring family into this. - You are so nice.

1061
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,430
(Their brotherly love is overwhelming.)

1062
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:47,130
- Kwang Soo. Stay on your toes. - I will.

1063
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,630
(I must succeed.)

1064
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:51,430
Start. What do you want to tell your girlfriend when you have one?

1065
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,960
Australopithecus.

1066
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:55,460
(Australopithecus?)

1067
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,060
(To my future girlfriend,)

1068
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,730
(you are an Australopithecus.)

1069
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:00,830
- Do you mean that? - What's wrong with that?

1070
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,130
(Kwang Soo fails.)

1071
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,230
What was wrong?

1072
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,430
Would I really say that to my girlfriend?

1073
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,560
No, that's not what I meant.

1074
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,200
- Your answer... - It makes sense.

1075
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,030
shouldn't make any sense.

1076
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,030
- She could look like an ape. - Right.

1077
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,530
- What did you say about my girl? - It's possible.

1078
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,400
So Min, you're our only hope.

1079
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,300
- Please, So Min. - Goodness.

1080
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:21,900
Get ready.

1081
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,430
(So Min distracts herself.)

1082
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,560
What are you looking at?

1083
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,700
She won't make eye contact. It's her strategy.

1084
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,160
That's a good idea.

1085
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,060
- So Min. - Say nonsense.

1086
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,130
You're up, So Min.

1087
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,960
Get ready, set, go.

1088
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,460
- What are you looking at? - An apple.

1089
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,600
- She lost. - What's wrong?

1090
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,660
Wait a minute.

1091
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:44,030
We got poop, strawberry, apple, and Australopithecus.

1092
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:46,200
(Their answers are short and strange.)

1093
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:47,560
What about my answer?

1094
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,230
We won!

1095
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,100
- I won't look at the camera. - Come on, So Min.

1096
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,360
What are you looking at?

1097
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,100
I was about to say "camera".

1098
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,830
She was looking at the camera,

1099
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,100
and the red button reminded her of an apple.

1100
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,770
What kind of answer was that?

1101
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,800
Look at this.

1102
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,030
Jong Kook, Haha, Ji Hyo, and Seok Jin earn one point each.

1103
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,230
(They earn 1 point.)

1104
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,530
We did a good job.

1105
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:14,100
It's possible that we'll get punished.

1106
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,500
Did we lose one point?

1107
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,860
My goodness.

1108
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:20,730
We have to determine who has the least score anyway.

1109
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,660
Each of you should choose whom you'll compete with.

1110
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,830
- I'll compete with Haha. - Okay.

1111
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,330
- Show us, Kwang Soo. - Okay.

1112
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:29,960
- Haha is too good. - No, I'm not.

1113
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,930
- Who starts first? - Kwang Soo.

1114
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:34,230
Kwang Soo starts. Ready, set, go.

1115
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,460
Say something to your wife.

1116
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,600
Say something to your wife.

1117
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,900
I love you.

1118
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,460
(He says after a pause.)

1119
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,460
(He says he loves her after a moment of hesitation.)

1120
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,200
He said it too late.

1121
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,560
- It took him a while to say it. - Wait a minute.

1122
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,800
My original answer was, "You're being ridiculous."

1123
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,300
(He almost couldn't return home today.)

1124
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:58,530
His wife is in a postpartum care center right now.

1125
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,400
She's still there.

1126
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,000
- I thought you'd say, - He can't say she's ridiculous.

1127
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,860
"poop" or something.

1128
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,960
- My answer was, "I love you." - You responded late.

1129
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,330
You should air it.

1130
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,830
Don't edit out the part when I say I love her.

1131
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,160
- Okay? - He loses one point.

1132
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,630
(The staff prepared something special.)

1133
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:15,800
Say something to your wife.

1134
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,100
(To Go Eun)

1135
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,230
I love you.

1136
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,060
(Congratulations on your second child.)

1137
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:26,300
Can't we get a point because our team lost?

1138
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,200
Haha lost a point, but Kwang Soo earned one.

1139
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,330
What about me?

1140
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,330
- Kwang Soo's score is zero. - Okay.

1141
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:32,860
Haha as well.

1142
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,130
- It's because he lost. - Zero?

1143
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,300
Okay.

1144
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,460
This is important.

1145
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:40,030
I don't want to get the sticker.

1146
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,200
- Are we really going? - Yes, we have to go.

1147
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,560
- It must be difficult. - I don't like haunted houses.

1148
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:48,100
Here's why.

1149
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,800
- Do you know Kim Hyun Ki? - I know him.

1150
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,060
When he worked as a reporter,

1151
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:57,000
he visited haunted houses in Japan.

1152
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,030
- At that time, - Did ghosts appear?

1153
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:02,400
he heard ghosts on the walkie-talkie and the radio.

1154
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,860
- It's very scary in Japan. - Once you go to...

1155
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:08,630
a haunted house in Japan, you feel confused for days.

1156
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,560
- Have you been there? - I heard about it.

1157
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,930
Then stay quiet.

1158
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,000
- I only heard it. - Stay quiet unless you went there.

1159
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,760
Don't try to brag.

1160
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,060
I just heard it.

1161
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,630
The crocodiles were scary too.

1162
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,660
They come through the wire fence.

1163
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,660
(Global Race)

1164
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:26,500
(The most dangerous tourist spots selected by travelers)

1165
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,660
(With 3 Solo Tour Cards,)

1166
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,160
(one can go on a trip.)

1167
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,960
(Who will be chosen?)

1168
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,630
(Global Race)

1169
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:35,230
(SBS Prism Tower)

1170
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:38,030
Something smells good. It's not what I thought.

1171
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,860
- What's this? - I thought they were watermelons.

1172
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,830
What's going on?

1173
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:44,530
Didn't we lose?

1174
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:45,830
- Come here. - Yes, we did.

1175
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,100
All right. Here's the next mission.

1176
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:51,100
It's a unanimous OX quiz called "Danger Next Door".

1177
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,900
(The second mission is "Danger Next Door".)

1178
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,830
("Danger Next Door"?)

1179
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:57,400
- What is it? - "Danger Next Door"?

1180
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,660
(Why is everything dangerous?)

1181
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,030
It's a unanimous OX quiz.

1182
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,260
(What's the dangerous secret hidden next door?)

1183
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:07,830
Please take a seat on the cushion laid out behind you.

1184
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,400
Which cushion you take is up to you.

1185
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:13,660
(Is it up to us?)

1186
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,930
(That sounds most suspicious.)

1187
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:17,000
Let's see.

1188
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,560
- There's something by the entrance. - Wait a minute.

1189
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:23,630
- This is the entrance. - There's something here.

1190
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:26,100
- Are you sitting there? - Something might come out.

1191
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,500
Something might come out.

1192
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,030
I trust Se Chan.

1193
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:32,800
- Me too. - Something is going on.

1194
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,260
What could it be?

1195
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:38,060
I hear some murmuring inside.

1196
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:40,260
What is it?

1197
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,600
(Everyone takes a seat nervously.)

1198
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,700
Here are the rules. As we have new members,

1199
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,100
we'll give an OX quiz to know each other's preferences and thoughts.

1200
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,100
The number of people with an opinion of the minority decides how many...

1201
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,360
are sent to the room next door starting from the right.

1202
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,100
I shouldn't sit here.

1203
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,160
(Why are you telling this now?)

1204
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,100
- I had no idea. - You should have told us before.

1205
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,960
This isn't right.

1206
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,660
- Come on. - This is great.

1207
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,930
- It's what Jong Kook said. - I told you.

1208
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,300
- This isn't right. - Jae Seok.

1209
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,200
- You can't sit there. - You have no choice.

1210
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,630
- Go back. - Play rock-paper-scissors.

1211
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:14,500
- No way. - Play fairly.

1212
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,730
I thought something good would come out.

1213
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,330
That's why...

1214
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:20,460
So Min told me...

1215
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,530
something would come out from next door.

1216
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,400
Hey!

1217
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,830
We have to go in there instead.

1218
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,700
She sat near the kitchen,

1219
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,160
so I thought food would come out.

1220
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,700
All the unlucky members are sitting here.

1221
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,030
Let's do well.

1222
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,800
(No one knows what's inside.)

1223
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,930
In the room next door...

1224
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,160
(What's in the dangerous room?)

1225
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,000
There are dangerous punishments.

1226
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,660
- Pardon me? - Punishments?

1227
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:53,700
(It's a compilation of the "best" punishments on Running Man.)

1228
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:58,500
There are amazing prizes as well.

1229
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,600
- That's right. - There are also good things.

1230
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,560
(There's a variety of benefits.)

1231
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,560
If you win a prize, you earn a point.

1232
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,600
If you get punished, you lose a point.

1233
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,730
Those who can't go in the room will get a chance.

1234
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:19,300
- What is it? - Based on the members' reactions,

1235
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,060
- guess if they got a prize or not. - Can you decide to go in?

1236
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,900
One person can volunteer to enter.

1237
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,360
This is better.

1238
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,500
- It depends on how we act. - Okay.

1239
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,530
That's right.

1240
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:28,860
They can trick us.

1241
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,760
If you have a unanimous opinion,

1242
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:34,400
you'll get one No Dangerous Bag Card.

1243
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,300
("Danger Next Door" starts.)

1244
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,930
Here's the first question. Please answer honestly.

1245
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:49,600
"I had my first kiss before I was 20."

1246
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,300
(Their hearts start to flutter.)

1247
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,030
Are we being really honest?

1248
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:54,600
Mine is unclear.

1249
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:57,330
- I think... - One, two, three.

1250
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,960
Mine is unclear.

1251
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,760
(Haha, Se Chan, Jong Kook, and Ji Hyo raise O.)

1252
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,460
(Seok Jin and So Min raise X.)

1253
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:10,200
There we go.

1254
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,260
(Moving)

1255
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:13,760
(Two members enter the room.)

1256
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,030
- What's going on? - No.

1257
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:18,360
(Jae Seok and So Min are selected.)

1258
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,730
- What's going on? - Am I also going in?

1259
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,660
I'm not, right?

1260
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,400
Okay.

1261
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,830
(What's inside the room?)

1262
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,130
- No! - What's going on?

1263
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:35,330
(He keeps screaming.)

1264
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:37,430
It must be a punishment.

1265
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,560
What's going on?

1266
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,000
- They're being punished. - It's a punishment.

1267
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,830
I think I know what it is.

1268
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,100
- They're being beaten. - It must be a punishment.

1269
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,260
Who thinks it's a prize and wants to go in?

1270
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:52,200
This can't be something good.

1271
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,500
- Here's why. - It's definitely a punishment.

1272
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,160
I heard other people inside.

1273
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:58,360
- No one wants to go in? - No.

1274
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,730
It's delicious.

1275
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,200
(She laughs emptily.)

1276
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,400
She said it's delicious.

1277
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,700
- She was screaming before. - That was a late reaction.

1278
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,530
The naengmyeon tastes great.

1279
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:10,060
It's really delicious.

1280
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:14,030
They're coming out.

1281
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:20,030
(Was it a prize or a punishment?)

1282
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:21,060
It was a punishment.

1283
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,060
(They were punished.)

1284
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,630
It was a punishment indeed!

1285
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,060
- It hurts. - So Min.

1286
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,360
Look at So Min.

1287
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:30,830
They have clothespins.

1288
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,030
I knew he was unlucky.

1289
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,160
It hurts.

1290
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,800
Take them off.

1291
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,060
It really hurts.

1292
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,630
You can't hide your reaction.

1293
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,030
Suddenly, she said it was delicious.

1294
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,230
"The naengmyeon tastes great."

1295
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:48,830
What was delicious?

1296
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:52,200
I shouldn't have sat here. I really shouldn't have.

1297
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:54,200
Gosh, I was so startled.

1298
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,260
We asked if your first kiss was before you were 20.

1299
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,230
Two members raised X.

1300
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,500
- Who were they? - Seok Jin and So Min.

1301
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,630
Wait.

1302
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,260
Was Jae Seok's first kiss in high school?

1303
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:06,260
It's unclear because it was when I was a senior.

1304
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,930
- It was during winter... - Stop lying.

1305
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,430
(What are you talking about, Jae Seok?)

1306
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:14,230
Don't pretend like you had your first kiss then.

1307
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,560
- Goodness. - Stop acting.

1308
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,630
He pretends to be strong.

1309
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:19,400
- Did you lie? - You didn't kiss.

1310
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,460
- Whom was it with? - Hey, do you believe me?

1311
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,600
- No. - No?

1312
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,530
- What are you talking about? - This is driving me crazy.

1313
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,030
My goodness. Hey.

1314
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:30,760
Wait a minute.

1315
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,260
- Did you raise O, Haha? - Of course.

1316
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,330
- How old were you? - It was early.

1317
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:37,330
- How old were you? - I was an expert at kissing.

1318
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:38,500
Stop joking.

1319
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,230
- How old were you, Se Chan? - I was a sophomore.

1320
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:45,330
- I was also an expert. - Wait a minute.

1321
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:46,330
(Their childhood was full of love.)

1322
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:49,600
I also like to kiss.

1323
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:51,630
Is this a competition?

1324
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,360
- Is it? - I was three.

1325
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,660
- What did you say? - I was three.

1326
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,160
(He gets competitive.)

1327
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,230
How about you, Kwang Soo?

1328
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:59,800
I was in seventh grade.

1329
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,160
- Stop joking. - It's true.

1330
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,230
- He said it was at home. - It was.

1331
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,660
- Kwang Soo. - That's early.

1332
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,100
Apologize. That was too early.

1333
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:10,860
The girl was older.

1334
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,360
You were wild.

1335
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,460
What?

1336
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,260
(She means that he was mature.)

1337
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,360
I wasn't wild.

1338
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,930
We had our parents'...

1339
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,930
- You brat. - It wasn't like that.

1340
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:21,930
- We had our parents' permission. - From that early age...

1341
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:24,300
- It wasn't like that. - You punk.

1342
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,160
- It wasn't like that. - You brat.

1343
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,200
What about you, So Min?

1344
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,500
When I was 21, at a bus stop.

1345
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,300
- That sounds very romantic. - Yes.

1346
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,300
- When there were no buses? - How?

1347
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,930
Yes, the buses had stopped running.

1348
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:36,030
How did it happen?

1349
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:37,300
It was sudden.

1350
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:38,930
The guy suddenly kissed me.

1351
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,230
(It was sudden.)

1352
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,860
(The quiet night air...)

1353
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:45,260
(was filled with my heartbeats.)

1354
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:48,500
(She suddenly felt the boy's lips.)

1355
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,800
It was sudden. The guy suddenly kissed me.

1356
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,060
- Was he your boyfriend? - Yes.

1357
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,160
- It was very short. - How did it feel?

1358
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,830
After the kiss, weren't you embarrassed?

1359
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:58,060
Sometimes, it becomes awkward.

1360
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,800
- Yes. It was my first kiss. - It can become awkward.

1361
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,630
- People say you hear bells ringing. - And?

1362
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,200
(How was So Min's first kiss...)

1363
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,800
(at a bus stop when she was 21?)

1364
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,930
It was my first kiss.

1365
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:12,400
- People say you hear bells ringing. - And?

1366
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,530
All I remember is the smell of his saliva.

1367
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:18,060
Gosh.

1368
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:19,230
(The smell of his saliva)

1369
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:21,860
- Don't give us too much details. - Gosh.

1370
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,960
So Min, don't say something like that.

1371
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,430
Don't ruin my fantasy.

1372
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:27,030
(Her first kiss was gross.)

1373
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:28,500
Please.

1374
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,200
- Can we switch places? - Of course.

1375
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,760
- Switch however you want. - It might be food this time.

1376
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,830
In any case, I don't want to sit here.

1377
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,600
So Min. It might be food.

1378
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,100
Do you want to switch with me?

1379
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:45,030
- Seok Jin will sit at the end. - It must be food this time.

1380
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:47,200
Doesn't it sound like they're cooking?

1381
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,960
Here's the second question.

1382
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,100
In relationships,

1383
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,760
I usually get dumped.

1384
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,760
My pride is at stake.

1385
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,130
One, two, three.

1386
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,400
My goodness.

1387
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:04,900
What's the result?

1388
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,800
Kwang Soo is showing an X.

1389
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,500
What?

1390
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,200
Jae Seok is showing an X too.

1391
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,830
(Four of them are sent to the next room.)

1392
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:13,200
- Jae Seok is showing an X too. - Why?

1393
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,830
What's with you?

1394
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,300
- How many are going in? - How many are going in?

1395
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,730
- How many are going in? - Am I going in too?

1396
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,260
- How many are going in? - Again?

1397
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,500
(Is it a penalty or a reward?)

1398
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,560
Is it four?

1399
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,230
(Shouting)

1400
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:28,700
(Why are they shouting?)

1401
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:29,760
All right.

1402
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,500
Does any of you want to participate?

1403
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,500
(The next room is dangerous.)

1404
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,260
Does any of you want to participate?

1405
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,730
(They're screaming.)

1406
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:39,730
I won't.

1407
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:40,900
(Se Chan raises his hand.)

1408
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,160
I want to participate.

1409
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,260
- Would you like to participate? - Yes.

1410
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,400
(Se Chan will participate.)

1411
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,330
(What's in the next room?)

1412
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:51,730
Go in.

1413
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,560
Oh, my.

1414
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,860
(What does he mean?)

1415
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:58,430
Come out.

1416
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:00,100
Really?

1417
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:05,630
(It's fried chicken.)

1418
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,830
It's food.

1419
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:10,360
It tastes so good.

1420
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,460
- Each gets a whole bucket. - It's a whole bucket.

1421
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:14,600
It tastes so good.

1422
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,130
(It was a reward this time.)

1423
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:17,460
It tastes amazing.

1424
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,000
(Se Chan wins fried chicken and one point.)

1425
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,630
Haha, I told you to come.

1426
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:25,100
(It's so tasty that it's dangerous.)

1427
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,600
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1428
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,560
Did you show an X?

1429
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,400
(Kwang Soo doesn't get dumped?)

1430
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,330
I know many cases.

1431
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:35,630
We know many cases. Why did you show an X?

1432
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:37,360
I don't usually get dumped.

1433
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,700
- I know about three cases. - That's...

1434
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,200
My girlfriend cheated on me, so I dumped her.

1435
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,530
It's you that got dumped.

1436
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,630
(It's you that got dumped.)

1437
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:48,100
What are you talking about?

1438
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:49,930
What makes you say that?

1439
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:52,530
She left you first.

1440
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:54,500
She cheated on me, so I dumped her.

1441
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,400
Hey.

1442
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,830
She turned out to have another guy.

1443
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:00,600
- Kwang Soo. - I broke up with her.

1444
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,730
Kwang Soo.

1445
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:03,130
- You know this story, right? - Kwang Soo.

1446
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,830
Everyone except you was aware...

1447
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,100
that you got dumped.

1448
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,600
I know what happened, and you got dumped.

1449
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:11,060
That's not true.

1450
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:13,630
(We root for you, Kwang Soo.)

1451
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:16,100
- So Min, what did you show? - I showed an O.

1452
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:17,700
How many boyfriends have you had so far?

1453
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,930
I've had three.

1454
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:21,260
- What? - Only three?

1455
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,360
- Are you sure? - I had three serious relationships.

1456
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,360
That's so few.

1457
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,330
In the three relationships, how many times did you get dumped?

1458
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,200
Twice.

1459
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:33,060
Why has everyone become so quiet?

1460
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,760
Why are we so quiet?

1461
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,460
- Have some chicken. - By the way...

1462
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,530
It's okay.

1463
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:39,930
- So Min. - Give her some water.

1464
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:41,560
You should eat a lot of good food.

1465
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,660
So Min, did you dump the other one?

1466
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,230
He cheated on me,

1467
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:49,260
and I clung to him.

1468
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,560
- Later, I dumped him. - That's enough.

1469
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,030
(That's enough.)

1470
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:54,060
Stop it now.

1471
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,360
We understand. Stop it.

1472
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,460
- Wait. - I took revenge.

1473
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:01,900
You said Kwang Soo is the one who got dumped.

1474
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,630
It means that you got dumped all three times.

1475
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,100
That's not true.

1476
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,730
So Min is the female version of Kwang Soo.

1477
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:09,830
- It's not like that. - You and I are the same.

1478
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:14,430
No. He cheated on me, and I wanted to forgive him,

1479
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:16,130
but he still didn't wish to come back.

1480
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:17,500
The girl told me to get lost.

1481
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,030
(They're the same.)

1482
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,030
She said she didn't want me. We're the same.

1483
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:22,600
- Both of you got dumped. - No.

1484
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,200
Don't ever call me since I dumped you.

1485
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,030
(All of the sudden)

1486
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:29,130
(Whom are you talking to?)

1487
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:30,930
- Whom are you talking to? - What?

1488
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,260
- Who are you talking to? - Is he here?

1489
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,800
- The cameraman? - Is it the cameraman?

1490
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,830
No.

1491
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:38,230
Call me. It's still not too late.

1492
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:40,460
Give me another chance.

1493
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:43,730
My goodness.

1494
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:44,830
(Clingy)

1495
00:56:45,584 --> 00:56:46,214
(Dangerous tourist attractions)

1496
00:56:46,414 --> 00:56:49,014
(They'll visit the most dangerous tourist attractions.)

1497
00:56:49,014 --> 00:56:50,344
(Global Race)

1498
00:56:50,344 --> 00:56:51,544
(The one who gets 3 Tour Stickers will go on a trip.)

1499
00:56:51,744 --> 00:56:53,544
(Who will go on the dangerous trip?)

1500
00:56:53,544 --> 00:56:55,114
(Dangerous tourist attractions)

1501
00:56:55,684 --> 00:56:57,114
Here's the next question.

1502
00:56:57,214 --> 00:57:01,784
"I'm 1 of the 3 most handsome members in Running Man."

1503
00:57:01,784 --> 00:57:03,684
- Of course. - One...

1504
00:57:03,684 --> 00:57:05,614
"I'm 1 of the 3 most handsome members in Running Man."

1505
00:57:05,614 --> 00:57:07,784
- Of course. - One...

1506
00:57:07,784 --> 00:57:08,944
One,

1507
00:57:08,944 --> 00:57:10,584
- two, - Of course it's an O.

1508
00:57:10,584 --> 00:57:12,344
three.

1509
00:57:12,514 --> 00:57:13,584
Okay.

1510
00:57:13,584 --> 00:57:14,644
- It must be unanimous. - Okay.

1511
00:57:14,644 --> 00:57:16,414
(Unanimous)

1512
00:57:17,244 --> 00:57:19,744
- Is it unanimous? - It's unanimous.

1513
00:57:19,744 --> 00:57:20,984
- Yes! - Yes!

1514
00:57:20,984 --> 00:57:22,444
It was too easy.

1515
00:57:22,444 --> 00:57:24,784
- You shouldn't have asked this. - It's obvious.

1516
00:57:24,784 --> 00:57:26,584
Everyone has their unique charms.

1517
00:57:26,584 --> 00:57:30,444
It's hard to say who's the most good-looking.

1518
00:57:30,444 --> 00:57:33,084
Number one would be Ji Hyo.

1519
00:57:33,084 --> 00:57:34,684
- Of course. - If we're only talking about looks.

1520
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:36,144
Tell us what you are.

1521
00:57:36,144 --> 00:57:37,284
I'm number two.

1522
00:57:37,284 --> 00:57:38,444
- What? - Number two.

1523
00:57:38,444 --> 00:57:42,714
You look like the master in "Drunken Master".

1524
00:57:43,014 --> 00:57:45,514
You look like the red-nosed master.

1525
00:57:45,514 --> 00:57:46,584
He's right.

1526
00:57:46,584 --> 00:57:49,284
- The master in "Drunken Master"? - He's right.

1527
00:57:49,284 --> 00:57:50,644
- The master? - He's right.

1528
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,414
Do you mean the man who does this?

1529
00:57:52,414 --> 00:57:53,484
(Speechless)

1530
00:57:53,484 --> 00:57:56,284
How can you be number two?

1531
00:57:56,284 --> 00:57:58,014
You look like the master in "Drunken Master".

1532
00:57:58,014 --> 00:58:00,144
Okay. For me,

1533
00:58:00,584 --> 00:58:02,914
it's hard to say who looks better between Ji Hyo and So Min,

1534
00:58:02,914 --> 00:58:05,044
but I'd be number two.

1535
00:58:05,444 --> 00:58:07,444
What did you just say?

1536
00:58:07,444 --> 00:58:10,614
- You're unbelievable. - What did you just say?

1537
00:58:10,614 --> 00:58:12,514
Are you out of your mind?

1538
00:58:12,744 --> 00:58:14,114
Are you out of your mind?

1539
00:58:14,284 --> 00:58:15,544
Hey, you're number eight.

1540
00:58:15,544 --> 00:58:16,584
(Not a chance)

1541
00:58:16,584 --> 00:58:18,444
- Are you out of your mind? - Get lost.

1542
00:58:18,444 --> 00:58:19,984
You're so shameless.

1543
00:58:20,684 --> 00:58:22,944
- He's out of his mind. - He's unbelievable.

1544
00:58:22,944 --> 00:58:23,944
Get off me.

1545
00:58:23,944 --> 00:58:25,384
- It's so annoying. - Get off me.

1546
00:58:25,814 --> 00:58:27,184
Get off me.

1547
00:58:29,414 --> 00:58:30,644
Let me tell you one more time.

1548
00:58:30,644 --> 00:58:34,314
- I'm 2nd. So Min is 3rd. - What about me?

1549
00:58:34,314 --> 00:58:35,814
You're uglier than me.

1550
00:58:36,944 --> 00:58:38,044
My goodness.

1551
00:58:38,044 --> 00:58:39,914
We have different charms.

1552
00:58:39,914 --> 00:58:42,014
Number eight would be Se Chan.

1553
00:58:42,014 --> 00:58:43,544
(That's one thing for certain.)

1554
00:58:43,884 --> 00:58:45,184
(Shocked)

1555
00:58:45,184 --> 00:58:46,844
- I agree. - Don't say that.

1556
00:58:46,844 --> 00:58:48,784
I agree.

1557
00:58:48,784 --> 00:58:51,214
Se Chan, you're the last.

1558
00:58:51,214 --> 00:58:52,814
- You're number eight. - Are you serious?

1559
00:58:52,814 --> 00:58:54,014
To be honest,

1560
00:58:54,014 --> 00:58:55,814
as he is ugly, I was afraid I'd hurt him...

1561
00:58:55,814 --> 00:58:57,284
if I say he's ugly.

1562
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,914
- You're lying. - You really are ugly.

1563
00:58:58,914 --> 00:58:59,914
- Kwang Soo. - I mean it.

1564
00:58:59,914 --> 00:59:02,684
Apart from your height, you're no match for me.

1565
00:59:02,844 --> 00:59:04,284
It's so infuriating.

1566
00:59:04,284 --> 00:59:06,084
- Do you want to see? - Kwang Soo.

1567
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,714
I had a hard time choosing between you and Se Chan.

1568
00:59:07,714 --> 00:59:09,184
Don't say that.

1569
00:59:09,484 --> 00:59:10,944
What about you, Ji Hyo?

1570
00:59:10,944 --> 00:59:12,014
Me?

1571
00:59:12,214 --> 00:59:13,214
You can be first.

1572
00:59:13,214 --> 00:59:14,614
- You're number one. - You can have it.

1573
00:59:14,644 --> 00:59:16,744
So Min would be number two.

1574
00:59:17,014 --> 00:59:18,444
- All right. - Number three would be...

1575
00:59:18,614 --> 00:59:20,744
Do you mean So Min is not as pretty as you are?

1576
00:59:20,744 --> 00:59:22,884
(Can't So Min be number one?)

1577
00:59:23,144 --> 00:59:24,444
- She isn't? - She isn't?

1578
00:59:24,444 --> 00:59:25,514
You know that?

1579
00:59:25,514 --> 00:59:28,614
She's never as pretty as you are, right?

1580
00:59:28,884 --> 00:59:30,344
What can I do about that?

1581
00:59:30,344 --> 00:59:32,984
(Embarrassed)

1582
00:59:32,984 --> 00:59:34,784
(I'm sorry I'm so pretty.)

1583
00:59:34,784 --> 00:59:36,244
What can I do?

1584
00:59:36,544 --> 00:59:38,214
- You're honest. - You're right.

1585
00:59:38,214 --> 00:59:39,244
Number eight?

1586
00:59:39,244 --> 00:59:40,784
- Tell us who you think is last. - Number eight?

1587
00:59:40,784 --> 00:59:41,814
Yes.

1588
00:59:41,814 --> 00:59:44,614
- Be honest. - It's neck and neck.

1589
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:46,144
- Who? - Pick one.

1590
00:59:46,144 --> 00:59:47,784
- Tell us. - Just pick one.

1591
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:49,484
Jae Seok and Se Chan are neck and neck.

1592
00:59:49,484 --> 00:59:52,744
(Jae Seok versus Se Chan)

1593
00:59:52,744 --> 00:59:54,044
- Ji Hyo. - By the way,

1594
00:59:54,044 --> 00:59:56,814
does she hate guys whose mouths stick out?

1595
00:59:57,084 --> 00:59:58,214
- Hey. - I mean...

1596
00:59:58,214 --> 00:59:59,484
- Come here. - I mean...

1597
00:59:59,484 --> 01:00:02,344
- Come here. Look at Kwang Soo. - Leave me out.

1598
01:00:02,344 --> 01:00:04,184
- Don't pick me, seriously. - Look at Kwang Soo.

1599
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:05,414
He looks so ugly right now.

1600
01:00:05,414 --> 01:00:07,844
- Look at him. - It's because I got splashed.

1601
01:00:08,514 --> 01:00:10,614
- Am I ugly? - Se Chan just gave me goosebumps.

1602
01:00:10,744 --> 01:00:12,684
Listen to what he just said later.

1603
01:00:12,684 --> 01:00:14,714
- What did I say? - He said to himself,

1604
01:00:15,014 --> 01:00:17,114
"Really? Me?"

1605
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:19,984
- Come here, Kwang Soo. - Really? Me?

1606
01:00:19,984 --> 01:00:21,014
(Has he never been called ugly?)

1607
01:00:21,014 --> 01:00:24,384
(Ugly? Me?)

1608
01:00:24,384 --> 01:00:27,214
- Am I really ugly? - "Am I really ugly"?

1609
01:00:27,244 --> 01:00:28,784
I think he's being serious.

1610
01:00:28,784 --> 01:00:31,344
The Yang brothers are nuts.

1611
01:00:31,344 --> 01:00:34,284
- Don't talk about my family. - Fine.

1612
01:00:34,284 --> 01:00:37,014
Okay. I'm sorry.

1613
01:00:37,014 --> 01:00:40,684
I'm wondering who So Min thinks is in last place.

1614
01:00:40,684 --> 01:00:42,884
- Me? - Purely based on our faces.

1615
01:00:42,884 --> 01:00:46,784
- I have a unique taste. - So who is it?

1616
01:00:46,914 --> 01:00:48,714
(Staring)

1617
01:00:48,714 --> 01:00:49,814
(He's still in last place.)

1618
01:00:49,814 --> 01:00:51,314
You...

1619
01:00:52,184 --> 01:00:54,714
Come on. This won't do.

1620
01:00:54,714 --> 01:00:56,244
(They applaud her for being objective.)

1621
01:00:56,244 --> 01:00:58,984
- Welcome, So Min. - She's good.

1622
01:00:58,984 --> 01:01:01,844
- She was being honest. - This is war, So Min.

1623
01:01:02,084 --> 01:01:03,914
It's war, So Min.

1624
01:01:03,914 --> 01:01:07,484
I'll explain it so that you can understand.

1625
01:01:07,484 --> 01:01:09,844
- Do it. - Listen. Ji Hyo is in first place.

1626
01:01:09,884 --> 01:01:11,584
- Right. - She's in first place.

1627
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:13,884
So Min and I...

1628
01:01:14,584 --> 01:01:16,814
are in 2nd place. We're both in 2nd place.

1629
01:01:16,814 --> 01:01:18,244
- For goodness' sake. - For goodness' sake.

1630
01:01:18,244 --> 01:01:21,544
(They get mad at each other.)

1631
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:24,344
- Do you want me to headbutt you? - My goodness.

1632
01:01:24,344 --> 01:01:26,784
Do you want me to hit you with my double eyelid?

1633
01:01:26,784 --> 01:01:29,544
(Everybody thinks they're last, but they think they're second.)

1634
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:32,514
And the rest of you can pick your spots.

1635
01:01:32,514 --> 01:01:35,644
No way. Don't group me with them, Haha.

1636
01:01:35,644 --> 01:01:37,144
- Don't do that to me. - Come on.

1637
01:01:37,144 --> 01:01:38,784
(Everybody else is the same.)

1638
01:01:38,784 --> 01:01:41,084
- What are you talking about? - Hey, Kwang Soo.

1639
01:01:41,084 --> 01:01:43,914
Haha's face is so common...

1640
01:01:43,914 --> 01:01:47,614
that 40 percent of our staff members have his face.

1641
01:01:47,614 --> 01:01:50,744
Look. If you find anybody with protruding lips,

1642
01:01:50,744 --> 01:01:54,144
they look like Jae Seok. Here he is. It's Jae Seok.

1643
01:01:54,144 --> 01:01:55,714
It's Jae Seok. They look exactly the same.

1644
01:01:55,714 --> 01:01:57,514
(It's Jae Seok's twin.)

1645
01:01:57,514 --> 01:02:00,144
They look the same. Put this cap on. They look the same.

1646
01:02:00,144 --> 01:02:02,314
- It's Jae Seok. How can you say no? - Hey.

1647
01:02:02,384 --> 01:02:03,544
(He's just slightly taller.)

1648
01:02:03,544 --> 01:02:06,084
- Right? Watch. - Hey.

1649
01:02:06,084 --> 01:02:07,984
(This is not it.)

1650
01:02:07,984 --> 01:02:09,544
(There's a group of people who look like him.)

1651
01:02:09,544 --> 01:02:13,014
If they wear glasses and a cap, they all look like you.

1652
01:02:13,014 --> 01:02:14,914
- Put it on. - There's another one here.

1653
01:02:14,914 --> 01:02:16,344
(Cap, glasses and protruded lips equal Jae Seok.)

1654
01:02:16,344 --> 01:02:19,584
- Don't do this to me. - What's going on?

1655
01:02:19,584 --> 01:02:21,484
- What's going on? - You're driving me nuts.

1656
01:02:21,484 --> 01:02:23,284
(It's okay. We're all living happily.)

1657
01:02:23,284 --> 01:02:25,914
- I'm sorry. - Don't worry.

1658
01:02:25,984 --> 01:02:27,884
- "Don't worry"? - Don't worry.

1659
01:02:28,184 --> 01:02:31,484
He's got the Korean face. I didn't realize it before.

1660
01:02:31,484 --> 01:02:32,544
(This is the new paradigm of Korean men.)

1661
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:34,884
(Find the real Jae Seok.)

1662
01:02:36,014 --> 01:02:37,544
Here's the next question.

1663
01:02:37,544 --> 01:02:41,984
"If Earth is destroyed and only these members are left,"

1664
01:02:41,984 --> 01:02:44,684
"there is someone here I'd like to date."

1665
01:02:44,684 --> 01:02:47,684
(I'd like to date one of the members if Earth was destroyed.)

1666
01:02:47,684 --> 01:02:49,814
- This is too difficult. - Hold on.

1667
01:02:49,814 --> 01:02:50,914
(These questions are getting difficult.)

1668
01:02:50,914 --> 01:02:52,344
Let's be honest with ourselves.

1669
01:02:52,344 --> 01:02:54,084
There are only eight people left on Earth.

1670
01:02:54,084 --> 01:02:56,684
Wait. There are only eight people left?

1671
01:02:56,684 --> 01:02:59,184
- Yes, there are. - He's the ugliest in the world?

1672
01:02:59,184 --> 01:03:01,644
What are you saying? We are similar.

1673
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:02,914
- No way. - Why me?

1674
01:03:02,914 --> 01:03:04,484
(You're 1st from the bottom.)

1675
01:03:04,484 --> 01:03:06,144
(We respect you.)

1676
01:03:06,144 --> 01:03:07,814
That's what it is.

1677
01:03:07,814 --> 01:03:10,744
- Am I that ugly? - Under this assumption, you are.

1678
01:03:10,744 --> 01:03:11,984
(We don't understand why he doesn't get it.)

1679
01:03:11,984 --> 01:03:15,384
One, two, three.

1680
01:03:15,384 --> 01:03:18,144
- Yes. - This is so obvious.

1681
01:03:21,984 --> 01:03:23,884
(2 people are chosen.)

1682
01:03:23,884 --> 01:03:24,884
(It's Jae Seok and Se Chan.)

1683
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,784
- How many people is it? - I'm worried about this one.

1684
01:03:26,784 --> 01:03:29,744
- My gosh. - Two people, right?

1685
01:03:30,144 --> 01:03:32,214
- Is it three? - Is it?

1686
01:03:32,384 --> 01:03:34,284
It's two.

1687
01:03:34,684 --> 01:03:35,884
Come in. It's three.

1688
01:03:35,884 --> 01:03:38,144
(You're here already so join us.)

1689
01:03:39,844 --> 01:03:40,984
(He's splayed out.)

1690
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:43,444
- It's 3. Come in. - It's 3.

1691
01:03:43,544 --> 01:03:44,984
(He's dragged.)

1692
01:03:44,984 --> 01:03:46,884
It's 2. It's 2, Seok Jin.

1693
01:03:46,884 --> 01:03:49,514
- It's 3. - Drag him. He can get the penalty.

1694
01:03:49,514 --> 01:03:51,484
- Do you want to save him? - No.

1695
01:03:51,484 --> 01:03:54,014
- He's in there already. - I'm not playing again.

1696
01:03:54,084 --> 01:03:55,284
It's two!

1697
01:03:56,144 --> 01:03:57,444
(Why me?)

1698
01:03:57,444 --> 01:03:58,644
(Laughing)

1699
01:03:59,014 --> 01:04:00,284
Come back out.

1700
01:04:00,284 --> 01:04:05,544
(What was in the room next door this time?)

1701
01:04:08,714 --> 01:04:11,144
It was two. Why did you drag me in?

1702
01:04:11,144 --> 01:04:15,844
(We're sorry if any of the viewers were having dinner.)

1703
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:17,744
This isn't fair.

1704
01:04:17,744 --> 01:04:20,644
- This is great. - Even when we were inside,

1705
01:04:20,644 --> 01:04:23,344
they wouldn't paint my face, saying I was already ugly.

1706
01:04:23,344 --> 01:04:25,084
(It looks like someone painted his face already.)

1707
01:04:25,084 --> 01:04:27,984
- They said he was okay. - They said I was ugly enough.

1708
01:04:27,984 --> 01:04:29,944
They said they could leave him be.

1709
01:04:30,184 --> 01:04:32,014
Why did you drag me in?

1710
01:04:32,014 --> 01:04:34,814
- Seok Jin looks the prettiest. - He looks the most decent.

1711
01:04:34,814 --> 01:04:35,814
(You're the prettiest.)

1712
01:04:35,814 --> 01:04:37,684
Who cares?

1713
01:04:37,714 --> 01:04:40,484
Two people said no. They won't date anybody here.

1714
01:04:40,484 --> 01:04:42,744
- Who were they? - It was me.

1715
01:04:42,744 --> 01:04:45,444
- Why? - To be honest,

1716
01:04:45,484 --> 01:04:48,714
So Min and Ji Hyo are like family to me.

1717
01:04:48,713 --> 01:04:51,713
- That's why. - What? You can't put it that way.

1718
01:04:51,713 --> 01:04:55,113
- I'm serious. I thought about it. - What about the rest of us?

1719
01:04:55,243 --> 01:04:56,583
I think it'll be a no.

1720
01:04:56,583 --> 01:05:00,213
I bet you'll be the most easily convinced.

1721
01:05:00,384 --> 01:05:02,644
Ji Hyo and So Min are very charming,

1722
01:05:02,644 --> 01:05:04,084
but they're not my style.

1723
01:05:04,084 --> 01:05:06,014
(I'm sorry, but it's true.)

1724
01:05:06,014 --> 01:05:08,814
I can win Jae Seok over with one finger.

1725
01:05:08,814 --> 01:05:11,484
(One finger is enough.)

1726
01:05:11,484 --> 01:05:13,514
- Come on. - That easily?

1727
01:05:13,514 --> 01:05:15,684
Hey, that's impossible.

1728
01:05:15,684 --> 01:05:17,114
Watch out.

1729
01:05:17,684 --> 01:05:18,714
(Pointing)

1730
01:05:18,784 --> 01:05:22,444
If it comes to that situation, he'll be at Ji Hyo's door all night...

1731
01:05:22,444 --> 01:05:25,514
saying, "Ji Hyo, give me a minute."

1732
01:05:25,514 --> 01:05:27,884
(Open the door for me, Ji Hyo.)

1733
01:05:27,884 --> 01:05:30,514
Hold on. We have to ask the others.

1734
01:05:30,514 --> 01:05:32,244
- Did you say yes? - I did.

1735
01:05:32,244 --> 01:05:34,744
- I want to date Ji Hyo. - Really?

1736
01:05:34,744 --> 01:05:37,384
- He's talking about the present. - The world doesn't have to end.

1737
01:05:37,383 --> 01:05:39,613
(It's a confession from the ugliest to the prettiest.)

1738
01:05:39,714 --> 01:05:43,684
The Earth doesn't have to be destroyed. She's very charming.

1739
01:05:43,684 --> 01:05:45,444
She's beautiful.

1740
01:05:45,444 --> 01:05:48,984
I'm sorry to say this, but it'll look just like this.

1741
01:05:48,984 --> 01:05:51,944
When the world comes to an end, the four of you will be there,

1742
01:05:52,084 --> 01:05:54,184
- and we'll be here. - Don't say that.

1743
01:05:54,184 --> 01:05:56,684
Don't say that. I don't belong here.

1744
01:05:56,684 --> 01:05:59,344
(They all fight back.)

1745
01:05:59,344 --> 01:06:02,084
Don't say that to me. I don't belong here.

1746
01:06:02,084 --> 01:06:04,984
- I'm disappointed in you. - Wait.

1747
01:06:04,984 --> 01:06:07,884
- Did you dress up, Kwang Soo? - Hey, look.

1748
01:06:07,884 --> 01:06:11,284
- Don't we look like a tribe? - Not me!

1749
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,084
- I didn't dress up! - It looks like you did.

1750
01:06:13,084 --> 01:06:16,144
(It's the ugly tribe.)

1751
01:06:16,814 --> 01:06:19,344
(The OX quiz continues.)

1752
01:06:19,344 --> 01:06:21,784
- Is it 2? - It's 2 again?

1753
01:06:21,784 --> 01:06:24,014
(They continue to earn points next door.)

1754
01:06:24,014 --> 01:06:25,714
What's this?

1755
01:06:26,544 --> 01:06:29,984
Hey. You...

1756
01:06:29,984 --> 01:06:31,584
(Who'll become the chosen tourist?)

1757
01:06:31,584 --> 01:06:33,514
I've seen you in a cartoon.

1758
01:06:40,014 --> 01:06:42,814
You all answered unanimously,

1759
01:06:42,814 --> 01:06:44,814
so you can remove one briefcase.

1760
01:06:44,814 --> 01:06:47,014
One person can remove it.

1761
01:06:47,014 --> 01:06:48,744
- Who wants to go? - Let's have So Min do it.

1762
01:06:48,744 --> 01:06:49,984
- You should. - Should I?

1763
01:06:49,984 --> 01:06:51,384
She has good senses.

1764
01:06:52,684 --> 01:06:55,244
(Two hours ago during the opening hour,)

1765
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:58,584
(she removed the Solo Tour Card.)

1766
01:06:58,584 --> 01:07:01,084
(Would her luck...)

1767
01:07:01,084 --> 01:07:03,884
(work this time as well?)

1768
01:07:03,884 --> 01:07:06,284
(There is 1 No Tour and Solo Tour Card each and 2 Couple Tour Cards.)

1769
01:07:06,284 --> 01:07:07,914
Pick the Solo Tour Card.

1770
01:07:07,914 --> 01:07:09,444
Please. That's what I want too.

1771
01:07:09,444 --> 01:07:10,544
(Please get rid of...)

1772
01:07:10,544 --> 01:07:13,084
(the Solo Tour Card.)

1773
01:07:14,244 --> 01:07:15,284
(She picks number 2.)

1774
01:07:15,284 --> 01:07:18,144
- Okay. - I pick number two.

1775
01:07:18,144 --> 01:07:19,744
I don't know about this one.

1776
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:21,884
(They're all worried.)

1777
01:07:21,884 --> 01:07:23,614
Okay, pick this one. Go ahead, So Min.

1778
01:07:23,744 --> 01:07:25,014
She picked this one.

1779
01:07:25,014 --> 01:07:26,644
As long as it's not the No Tour Card.

1780
01:07:26,644 --> 01:07:28,184
- Please. - One, two.

1781
01:07:28,184 --> 01:07:32,184
(What is in the briefcase that So Min has picked?)

1782
01:07:34,084 --> 01:07:36,644
- It's the Couple Tour Card. - It's the Couple Tour Card.

1783
01:07:36,644 --> 01:07:38,584
(Couple Tour Card)

1784
01:07:38,584 --> 01:07:41,384
(At least it's not the No Tour Card.)

1785
01:07:41,384 --> 01:07:43,014
This is not bad.

1786
01:07:43,014 --> 01:07:46,284
- Good thing it wasn't No Tour Card. - Exactly.

1787
01:07:46,284 --> 01:07:49,084
- We have one left of each. - We just need the No Tour Card.

1788
01:07:49,084 --> 01:07:51,344
We have one of each card now.

1789
01:07:51,344 --> 01:07:54,184
- We still have hope. - This is why it's 50-50 chance.

1790
01:07:54,184 --> 01:07:55,684
There's the Couple Tour Card left.

1791
01:07:55,684 --> 01:07:59,514
You can erase your makeup, and we'll move onto the next game.

1792
01:07:59,514 --> 01:08:00,984
- All right. - Okay.

1793
01:08:00,984 --> 01:08:03,184
(They move onto the next dangerous game.)

1794
01:08:04,084 --> 01:08:05,084
(Global Race)

1795
01:08:05,084 --> 01:08:07,784
(The most dangerous tour sites chosen by bloggers)

1796
01:08:07,784 --> 01:08:09,084
(With 3 Solo Tour Cards,)

1797
01:08:09,084 --> 01:08:10,384
(one can go on a trip.)

1798
01:08:10,384 --> 01:08:12,344
(Who will be chosen?)

1799
01:08:12,344 --> 01:08:13,784
(Global Race)

1800
01:08:14,384 --> 01:08:18,284
Before we play the last game, divide yourselves into two teams.

1801
01:08:18,284 --> 01:08:19,984
- Is it up to us? - It's 4 on 4?

1802
01:08:19,984 --> 01:08:21,384
It's up to us?

1803
01:08:21,384 --> 01:08:22,684
(We have to make our own teams?)

1804
01:08:22,684 --> 01:08:25,384
(Then...)

1805
01:08:25,984 --> 01:08:28,884
- It worries me to be on your team. - Isn't this fine?

1806
01:08:28,884 --> 01:08:31,244
Please choose carefully. This is your last chance.

1807
01:08:32,554 --> 01:08:33,884
Who has the same number of points as me?

1808
01:08:33,884 --> 01:08:35,744
- Me. - Him.

1809
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:39,514
- You too? Go there then. - Yes.

1810
01:08:39,584 --> 01:08:43,084
Why are you handing over the burden?

1811
01:08:43,084 --> 01:08:45,814
- That's what I'm saying. - No, you just have to come over.

1812
01:08:45,814 --> 01:08:48,114
- You just have to come over. - Switch with him?

1813
01:08:49,014 --> 01:08:50,444
(Sure)

1814
01:08:51,444 --> 01:08:54,084
- Don't go. - Jong Kook.

1815
01:08:54,084 --> 01:08:55,244
(It's an unfair trade.)

1816
01:08:55,244 --> 01:08:56,644
Where are you going?

1817
01:08:56,644 --> 01:08:58,284
(That's a huge imbalance.)

1818
01:08:58,284 --> 01:09:00,784
- He's so weird. - What's wrong with you?

1819
01:09:00,784 --> 01:09:03,744
- This is not fair. - I'll say this.

1820
01:09:03,814 --> 01:09:07,284
There's no advantage for being strong.

1821
01:09:07,284 --> 01:09:11,714
Why are you telling us that?

1822
01:09:12,184 --> 01:09:14,014
- What are you saying? - What are you saying?

1823
01:09:14,014 --> 01:09:15,554
(Do we look that weak?)

1824
01:09:15,884 --> 01:09:18,584
- Hey. Let's do this. - All right.

1825
01:09:18,584 --> 01:09:21,184
- This looks good. - These are the teams.

1826
01:09:21,184 --> 01:09:24,784
(Seok Jin, Jong Kook, and Haha lead with 1 point each.)

1827
01:09:25,314 --> 01:09:29,514
This mission is your last chance to earn your points.

1828
01:09:29,514 --> 01:09:32,514
It's called, "Dangerous Gathering".

1829
01:09:32,514 --> 01:09:34,214
- You have to find something. - "Gathering"?

1830
01:09:34,244 --> 01:09:35,914
Pick who's going to go first,

1831
01:09:35,914 --> 01:09:38,684
and you can hide behind the curtains.

1832
01:09:38,784 --> 01:09:41,244
The other team will stand on any one spot...

1833
01:09:41,244 --> 01:09:43,984
from the square that lists numbers 1 to 4.

1834
01:09:43,984 --> 01:09:47,554
Each spot can hold up to three people.

1835
01:09:47,554 --> 01:09:51,554
Add your numbers together...

1836
01:09:52,184 --> 01:09:54,984
- to earn your points. - I might lose all my points.

1837
01:09:55,014 --> 01:09:57,014
- I'm minus 2... - You're minus 2.

1838
01:09:57,014 --> 01:09:59,744
so if you pick me, I'll be minus one.

1839
01:09:59,744 --> 01:10:01,444
(You'll earn the added points.)

1840
01:10:01,444 --> 01:10:05,514
However, since Kwang Soo is minus 1 and Jae Seok is minus 2...

1841
01:10:06,144 --> 01:10:11,514
(If you combine these 2...)

1842
01:10:12,144 --> 01:10:14,084
- We're nuclear bombs. - Right.

1843
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:15,554
(They're the bombs.)

1844
01:10:15,554 --> 01:10:17,744
- This is awesome. - Okay.

1845
01:10:17,744 --> 01:10:19,554
It's better to have more minuses.

1846
01:10:19,554 --> 01:10:20,714
- That's right. - Minuses are good.

1847
01:10:20,714 --> 01:10:22,344
We just have to avoid Se Chan.

1848
01:10:22,344 --> 01:10:23,944
This is bad.

1849
01:10:23,944 --> 01:10:25,484
(They're full of minuses.)

1850
01:10:25,484 --> 01:10:27,084
But you have me. Don't worry.

1851
01:10:27,084 --> 01:10:31,414
If you land on us, you'll get destroyed.

1852
01:10:31,414 --> 01:10:32,714
This isn't beneficial to us.

1853
01:10:32,714 --> 01:10:35,714
Let's separate ourselves.

1854
01:10:36,484 --> 01:10:37,484
Go ahead.

1855
01:10:38,314 --> 01:10:39,414
Well...

1856
01:10:39,684 --> 01:10:42,684
It'll be bad for us whatever we pick.

1857
01:10:43,014 --> 01:10:44,514
It's good if they pick me.

1858
01:10:44,784 --> 01:10:47,284
- It'll be good for us. - Exactly.

1859
01:10:47,284 --> 01:10:48,554
So I have to stand by myself.

1860
01:10:48,814 --> 01:10:50,314
- Let's separate. - Let's all separate.

1861
01:10:51,584 --> 01:10:52,884
Is this good?

1862
01:10:53,244 --> 01:10:55,984
We're competing against them,

1863
01:10:56,554 --> 01:10:58,514
but I'm also competing against Jae Seok.

1864
01:10:58,514 --> 01:11:01,214
(They're racing for last place.)

1865
01:11:01,314 --> 01:11:03,984
- We're both minuses. - If I become minus two...

1866
01:11:03,984 --> 01:11:06,114
If I pick Se Chan,

1867
01:11:06,244 --> 01:11:08,144
- it's over for me. - It'll be the worst score.

1868
01:11:08,244 --> 01:11:09,244
Jae Seok.

1869
01:11:09,714 --> 01:11:12,484
If you pick Se Chan, you have to book a flight to Japan.

1870
01:11:13,514 --> 01:11:15,644
(Goodbye)

1871
01:11:15,644 --> 01:11:17,684
You can pick first since you're last place.

1872
01:11:17,684 --> 01:11:19,914
- My goodness. - You can go.

1873
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:22,344
- It's competition again. - This is an individual race...

1874
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:23,784
- so let's do rock, paper, scissors. - Do rock, paper, scissors.

1875
01:11:23,784 --> 01:11:25,414
- As long as we don't get this. - Exactly.

1876
01:11:25,413 --> 01:11:27,813
- Avoid Se Chan. - As long as I don't get this.

1877
01:11:27,983 --> 01:11:29,283
- Rock, paper, scissors - Scissors

1878
01:11:29,983 --> 01:11:32,383
- What do people usually... - When it comes to numbers...

1879
01:11:32,643 --> 01:11:35,243
They're always unlucky so I can't predict what they're going to pick.

1880
01:11:35,384 --> 01:11:36,984
(It's impossible to analyze them.)

1881
01:11:36,984 --> 01:11:38,114
I don't know what to do.

1882
01:11:39,814 --> 01:11:42,784
(I think Jae Seok will pick this.)

1883
01:11:43,344 --> 01:11:45,484
(That's right. You're right.)

1884
01:11:45,484 --> 01:11:46,684
You're right.

1885
01:11:46,684 --> 01:11:49,914
(They want Jae Seok to pick Se Chan so that he comes in last place.)

1886
01:11:49,914 --> 01:11:50,944
(What would the result be?)

1887
01:11:50,944 --> 01:11:53,214
Rest of you, please face the other way.

1888
01:11:53,584 --> 01:11:57,784
What number did you choose, Kwang Soo?

1889
01:11:59,844 --> 01:12:00,984
I pick...

1890
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:02,054
(Hesitating)

1891
01:12:02,054 --> 01:12:04,484
Number two!

1892
01:12:04,484 --> 01:12:09,144
(Kwang Soo picks number 2. If he picks Se Chan, he's last.)

1893
01:12:09,144 --> 01:12:10,614
My gosh.

1894
01:12:11,414 --> 01:12:12,844
What am I supposed to choose?

1895
01:12:12,844 --> 01:12:14,014
(He only has to avoid Se Chan.)

1896
01:12:14,644 --> 01:12:16,054
(Opening)

1897
01:12:17,514 --> 01:12:23,144
(Who's standing on number 2?)

1898
01:12:23,144 --> 01:12:26,054
(It's Haha.)

1899
01:12:27,184 --> 01:12:31,184
(Kwang Soo picks Haha.)

1900
01:12:31,184 --> 01:12:34,684
(He has 0 points now.)

1901
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:37,514
(It's between me and Jae Seok.)

1902
01:12:38,944 --> 01:12:40,844
So Min is next.

1903
01:12:41,584 --> 01:12:43,054
I don't know what to do.

1904
01:12:44,284 --> 01:12:46,614
I pick number three.

1905
01:12:46,944 --> 01:12:49,184
(She picks Jong Kook.)

1906
01:12:49,184 --> 01:12:50,914
I was going to do that.

1907
01:12:54,084 --> 01:12:56,914
(Don't say anything, So Min.)

1908
01:12:58,414 --> 01:13:02,914
(So Min also has 0 points.)

1909
01:13:02,914 --> 01:13:04,214
It's Jae Seok's turn.

1910
01:13:04,214 --> 01:13:06,284
(Come here, Jae Seok.)

1911
01:13:06,684 --> 01:13:08,114
- What's left now? - Number 1 and 4.

1912
01:13:08,114 --> 01:13:10,784
(Number 1 and 4 are left.)

1913
01:13:11,644 --> 01:13:14,484
(He has to avoid Se Chan on number 1.)

1914
01:13:15,184 --> 01:13:16,344
(Sighing)

1915
01:13:20,184 --> 01:13:22,884
- I'm done if I choose Se Chan. - You are.

1916
01:13:22,884 --> 01:13:26,554
(Jae Seok and Se Chan are both last place with minus 2 points.)

1917
01:13:26,554 --> 01:13:30,884
(He has to avoid losing more points so that he doesn't end up last.)

1918
01:13:30,884 --> 01:13:36,284
(He picks a number. He walks towards it.)

1919
01:13:36,284 --> 01:13:40,444
(What number did he pick?)

1920
01:13:45,484 --> 01:13:47,614
(What?)

1921
01:13:48,314 --> 01:13:50,314
(Did he pick Se Chan?)

1922
01:13:51,214 --> 01:13:53,184
(My gosh)

1923
01:13:53,184 --> 01:13:55,814
Jae Seok is done for!

1924
01:13:55,814 --> 01:13:56,914
(What happened?)

1925
01:13:57,514 --> 01:13:59,344
(3 minutes ago...)

1926
01:13:59,344 --> 01:14:00,684
I choose number one.

1927
01:14:00,684 --> 01:14:02,514
(He makes up his mind.)

1928
01:14:03,644 --> 01:14:05,784
(You're coming here?)

1929
01:14:08,344 --> 01:14:11,344
(He's ready to welcome Jae Seok.)

1930
01:14:12,344 --> 01:14:16,554
Jae Seok is done for!

1931
01:14:16,554 --> 01:14:18,444
(Boiling)

1932
01:14:18,444 --> 01:14:19,684
This is unbelievable.

1933
01:14:20,184 --> 01:14:23,644
(Let's worship Jae Seok.)

1934
01:14:23,644 --> 01:14:25,414
- He's so unlucky. - This is so strange.

1935
01:14:25,414 --> 01:14:27,944
(Jae Seok has minus 4 points now.)

1936
01:14:28,014 --> 01:14:29,644
He's doomed!

1937
01:14:29,644 --> 01:14:32,214
- My gosh. - How's this possible?

1938
01:14:32,314 --> 01:14:34,414
Book him a ticket to the shark cage in Hawaii!

1939
01:14:35,144 --> 01:14:36,784
He has no time to waste!

1940
01:14:36,784 --> 01:14:41,984
(He's getting closer to meeting the sharks.)

1941
01:14:41,984 --> 01:14:43,884
- Why did you go to number one? - But...

1942
01:14:44,014 --> 01:14:46,014
- You don't know yet. - We do not.

1943
01:14:46,014 --> 01:14:47,284
- We don't know yet. - We have Se Chan.

1944
01:14:47,284 --> 01:14:49,414
- These two might stand together. - That's right.

1945
01:14:49,414 --> 01:14:50,814
We might stand together.

1946
01:14:51,014 --> 01:14:52,614
(What will happen to Jong Kook's team?)

1947
01:14:52,614 --> 01:14:54,214
These are the points.

1948
01:14:54,214 --> 01:14:56,284
Look. I'm sure...

1949
01:14:56,284 --> 01:14:58,884
- minus 2 and 1 will go together. - Of course.

1950
01:14:58,884 --> 01:15:00,244
Even if I pick it...

1951
01:15:00,514 --> 01:15:01,584
You'll be minus 2.

1952
01:15:01,584 --> 01:15:04,614
I'll be minus 2 and Jae Seok will still lose.

1953
01:15:04,614 --> 01:15:06,344
- As long as you don't get Jae Seok. - You have to be careful.

1954
01:15:06,344 --> 01:15:07,844
It's between me and Jae Seok.

1955
01:15:07,844 --> 01:15:08,914
(It's a race against the losers.)

1956
01:15:08,914 --> 01:15:10,314
- No, no. - Let's stand together.

1957
01:15:10,484 --> 01:15:12,884
- You have to go together. - We have to.

1958
01:15:13,054 --> 01:15:14,244
It's useless otherwise.

1959
01:15:14,244 --> 01:15:16,284
The best you can do is a tie.

1960
01:15:16,284 --> 01:15:17,514
(The minuses have to team up for Jae Seok's sake.)

1961
01:15:17,514 --> 01:15:20,054
- We have to hope Se Chan picks us. - I got it.

1962
01:15:20,614 --> 01:15:23,814
(Would Se Chan avoid them?)

1963
01:15:24,084 --> 01:15:25,114
Haha.

1964
01:15:26,144 --> 01:15:27,644
Where will you go?

1965
01:15:29,284 --> 01:15:30,684
(I choose 2.)

1966
01:15:31,344 --> 01:15:35,144
(He picks number 2 without any pressure.)

1967
01:15:37,514 --> 01:15:40,344
(Don't come here, Haha.)

1968
01:15:42,214 --> 01:15:46,214
(Where did he choose?)

1969
01:15:47,844 --> 01:15:52,884
(He picked So Min. He has 0 points.)

1970
01:15:53,644 --> 01:15:55,784
(It's okay as long as he's not last.)

1971
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:58,784
(We want you so much, Se Chan.)

1972
01:15:58,784 --> 01:15:59,814
Ji Hyo.

1973
01:16:00,054 --> 01:16:01,584
(Next is Ji Hyo with 0 points.)

1974
01:16:02,414 --> 01:16:03,484
Pick, please.

1975
01:16:04,384 --> 01:16:07,514
(If Ji Hyo picks Jae Seok, he's automatically in last place.)

1976
01:16:15,344 --> 01:16:21,144
(You're not coming to us, right?)

1977
01:16:21,144 --> 01:16:22,614
(She passes by.)

1978
01:16:24,054 --> 01:16:26,384
(Good job, Ji Hyo.)

1979
01:16:27,884 --> 01:16:32,584
Jong Kook and Se Chan, you can pick together and check.

1980
01:16:33,884 --> 01:16:35,054
Please go in.

1981
01:16:35,054 --> 01:16:39,914
(If Se Chan picks 3, he's last. If he picks 4, Jae Seok is last.)

1982
01:16:41,084 --> 01:16:45,284
(Who'll be the first runner-up for the dangerous tour?)

1983
01:16:45,284 --> 01:16:52,214
(Is it Jae Seok or Se Chan? Who's the unluckiest one?)

1984
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:59,244
(Se Chan picked number 3.)

1985
01:17:00,814 --> 01:17:03,314
(Se Chan got unlucky again.)

1986
01:17:05,614 --> 01:17:07,984
Really? Are you serious?

1987
01:17:08,114 --> 01:17:09,444
He's so unlucky.

1988
01:17:09,914 --> 01:17:11,444
(Jae Seok is not last anymore.)

1989
01:17:11,444 --> 01:17:12,714
- Really? - This is impossible.

1990
01:17:13,014 --> 01:17:15,314
- Are you serious? - He's so unlucky.

1991
01:17:15,314 --> 01:17:18,944
He's so unlucky.

1992
01:17:18,944 --> 01:17:20,984
- He's so unlucky. - He's so bad.

1993
01:17:20,984 --> 01:17:22,484
- He's so unlucky. - He's so unlucky.

1994
01:17:22,484 --> 01:17:24,344
(Even the staff's in awe of his "great" foresight.)

1995
01:17:24,344 --> 01:17:25,344
(10 minutes ago...)

1996
01:17:25,344 --> 01:17:27,414
- You can pick ours. - Go ahead.

1997
01:17:27,844 --> 01:17:29,144
Can I do this?

1998
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:30,914
- Sure. - It's up to you.

1999
01:17:30,914 --> 01:17:32,114
- I'll pick this. - You get first pick.

2000
01:17:33,244 --> 01:17:37,144
(He assigned the rest of his team.)

2001
01:17:37,144 --> 01:17:40,054
(While he picked number 3 and assigned the others,)

2002
01:17:40,054 --> 01:17:41,844
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo stood on number 3.)

2003
01:17:41,844 --> 01:17:42,914
I'll go first.

2004
01:17:42,914 --> 01:17:44,944
- I'm safe. - How?

2005
01:17:45,314 --> 01:17:46,444
I understand him now.

2006
01:17:46,444 --> 01:17:47,714
- I finally got lucky. - I understand him now.

2007
01:17:47,714 --> 01:17:49,884
- He's the ticking bomb. - He is.

2008
01:17:49,884 --> 01:17:50,944
You're incredible.

2009
01:17:50,944 --> 01:17:52,484
- He's the bomb. - It's not a prank, right?

2010
01:17:52,484 --> 01:17:54,014
It's not. We're here from the beginning.

2011
01:17:54,014 --> 01:17:56,214
- He's the bomb. - This was the original.

2012
01:17:56,514 --> 01:17:59,554
Se Chan is in last place with minus five points.

2013
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:02,744
Jae Seok survived.

2014
01:18:04,944 --> 01:18:07,084
Let's see what happens to Se Chan.

2015
01:18:07,084 --> 01:18:09,344
- There's the No Tour Card. - We'll go to the lobby,

2016
01:18:09,344 --> 01:18:15,114
and you'll pick either No Tour, Solo, or Couple Tour Card.

2017
01:18:15,114 --> 01:18:16,114
There's Couple Tour Card.

2018
01:18:16,114 --> 01:18:19,514
What if he picks Couple Tour Card and takes Jae Seok?

2019
01:18:21,184 --> 01:18:23,944
If I pick Couple Tour Card, I'll take you.

2020
01:18:23,944 --> 01:18:25,184
- Se Chan. - Se Chan.

2021
01:18:25,344 --> 01:18:27,744
Se Chan. Calm down.

2022
01:18:27,744 --> 01:18:29,144
- Why? - Calm down.

2023
01:18:29,144 --> 01:18:30,584
- Let me breathe. - There's No Tour Card.

2024
01:18:30,584 --> 01:18:32,554
- That's right. - There is.

2025
01:18:32,554 --> 01:18:34,484
- Let me breathe. - There's one of each.

2026
01:18:34,484 --> 01:18:35,884
(It's the moment of truth.)

2027
01:18:35,884 --> 01:18:38,414
This is fun. It's fun until the end.

2028
01:18:38,514 --> 01:18:41,214
- Those briefcases are scary. - This is exciting.

2029
01:18:41,284 --> 01:18:42,554
- Se Chan. - Yes.

2030
01:18:42,554 --> 01:18:43,554
(Se Chan's decision remains.)

2031
01:18:43,984 --> 01:18:45,484
Pick a briefcase.

2032
01:18:46,084 --> 01:18:49,814
I'll be so happy if he gets the No Tour Card.

2033
01:18:49,814 --> 01:18:50,914
(Everybody will be happy that way.)

2034
01:18:50,914 --> 01:18:55,144
- Be calm, Se Chan. - I'll be calm.

2035
01:18:55,144 --> 01:18:57,784
(This doesn't just involve you.)

2036
01:18:57,844 --> 01:18:59,014
- I'll pick. - Go.

2037
01:18:59,014 --> 01:19:00,214
It won't be easy.

2038
01:19:01,184 --> 01:19:02,484
- I pick five. - I knew it.

2039
01:19:03,414 --> 01:19:04,784
(He's certain.)

2040
01:19:04,784 --> 01:19:06,114
- You knew? - I did.

2041
01:19:06,314 --> 01:19:07,784
- I thought so. - I won't open it.

2042
01:19:07,844 --> 01:19:10,054
- Se Chan picked five. - I knew it.

2043
01:19:10,054 --> 01:19:14,054
For transparency, please open number six.

2044
01:19:15,444 --> 01:19:17,614
This is fun. It's exciting. How nervous.

2045
01:19:17,984 --> 01:19:19,884
- I hope it's not the No Tour Card. - What is it?

2046
01:19:19,884 --> 01:19:21,554
(Please don't be.)

2047
01:19:22,314 --> 01:19:25,484
(What is in briefcase number 6 that Se Chan didn't pick?)

2048
01:19:25,484 --> 01:19:26,884
- What is it? - Solo Tour Card.

2049
01:19:28,054 --> 01:19:29,214
Solo Tour Card.

2050
01:19:29,214 --> 01:19:31,184
(The Solo Tour Card is out.)

2051
01:19:31,184 --> 01:19:33,484
He escaped the solo tour.

2052
01:19:33,614 --> 01:19:36,684
(It's still possible he picked the Couple Tour Card.)

2053
01:19:36,684 --> 01:19:39,884
- He escaped the solo tour. - I'm relieved.

2054
01:19:40,414 --> 01:19:42,484
- I'm relieved. - What did I say?

2055
01:19:43,914 --> 01:19:46,684
- Congratulations. - Good job.

2056
01:19:46,844 --> 01:19:48,714
Wait. Jae Seok wanted him...

2057
01:19:48,714 --> 01:19:51,214
to pick the No Tour Card, and he looks so sad now.

2058
01:19:51,214 --> 01:19:53,414
- Why do you look regretful? - Inside that briefcase...

2059
01:19:54,114 --> 01:19:57,114
is either a Couple Tour or a No Tour Card.

2060
01:19:57,114 --> 01:19:59,714
Would you like to switch...

2061
01:19:59,784 --> 01:20:01,684
- or not? - Se Chan...

2062
01:20:03,214 --> 01:20:06,644
(Se Chan has one last chance to switch.)

2063
01:20:06,644 --> 01:20:09,744
(Will he take the chance or refuse?)

2064
01:20:09,744 --> 01:20:12,144
I need the No Tour Card, right?

2065
01:20:12,384 --> 01:20:14,144
- Only think about that. - No Tour Card, right?

2066
01:20:14,144 --> 01:20:15,844
- Think about that card. - That's what you need.

2067
01:20:16,114 --> 01:20:17,984
- I picked number five, right? - Yes.

2068
01:20:18,614 --> 01:20:20,844
- Don't hesitate. - I will...

2069
01:20:20,844 --> 01:20:24,314
This is your first time starring on the show as a member of the show.

2070
01:20:24,314 --> 01:20:26,744
(Haha recommends the briefcase number 1 since it's his 1st time.)

2071
01:20:28,684 --> 01:20:30,614
(This is his first appearances as a regular member.)

2072
01:20:30,614 --> 01:20:34,744
(This is the first episode of the global project.)

2073
01:20:34,744 --> 01:20:37,214
(This suggestion sounds tempting. Will he change?)

2074
01:20:37,214 --> 01:20:39,784
I will switch.

2075
01:20:39,784 --> 01:20:40,944
- Really? - The first briefcase?

2076
01:20:40,944 --> 01:20:43,884
(He kept making the wrong decisions. He feels he must change his choice.)

2077
01:20:43,884 --> 01:20:46,554
- I think I must change my decision. - You think so?

2078
01:20:46,554 --> 01:20:48,244
(He really changed?)

2079
01:20:48,244 --> 01:20:51,884
We will open the briefcase Se Chan has selected.

2080
01:20:53,884 --> 01:20:55,784
(The member who will go...)

2081
01:20:55,784 --> 01:20:59,384
(to the dangerous tourist attraction depends on this briefcase.)

2082
01:21:00,014 --> 01:21:02,744
(If a No Tour Card is inside, Se Chan won't go on a trip.)

2083
01:21:02,744 --> 01:21:06,484
(If a Couple Tour Card is inside, a member will go on a trip with him.)

2084
01:21:06,484 --> 01:21:09,014
(What is inside the briefcase number 1?)

2085
01:21:10,744 --> 01:21:14,144
(He picks the Couple Tour Card.)

2086
01:21:15,314 --> 01:21:18,514
- Wait. Hold on. - You have to...

2087
01:21:18,784 --> 01:21:20,944
(This is crazy. Goodness!)

2088
01:21:20,944 --> 01:21:22,014
(He checks the briefcase number 5.)

2089
01:21:22,014 --> 01:21:24,144
- You are amazing. - This had the No Tour Card.

2090
01:21:24,144 --> 01:21:26,644
- This is crazy. - What is wrong with you?

2091
01:21:26,644 --> 01:21:29,444
Is this true? That was the Couple Tour Card?

2092
01:21:29,444 --> 01:21:31,514
(He is truly the unluckiest one.)

2093
01:21:32,014 --> 01:21:34,344
He is the unluckiest.

2094
01:21:34,344 --> 01:21:36,244
(This is the class of new master of the misfortunes.)

2095
01:21:36,244 --> 01:21:38,054
You had the No Tour Card right here.

2096
01:21:38,054 --> 01:21:39,554
He's the king of misfortunes.

2097
01:21:39,554 --> 01:21:41,244
(Se Chan will choose his companion.)

2098
01:21:41,244 --> 01:21:44,414
The rest of the members will turn around.

2099
01:21:44,484 --> 01:21:47,414
- He'll remove a member's name tag. - Okay.

2100
01:21:47,644 --> 01:21:49,344
- Is there a point of this? - All right.

2101
01:21:49,844 --> 01:21:52,244
We never know whom Se Chan will choose.

2102
01:21:52,244 --> 01:21:54,054
- Se Chan. Choose whoever you want. - All right. I will.

2103
01:21:54,054 --> 01:21:55,244
- I'm not even worried. - Choose whoever you want.

2104
01:21:55,444 --> 01:21:56,844
No one will scold you.

2105
01:21:57,584 --> 01:22:00,114
- Who is the companion... - I'm nervous.

2106
01:22:00,114 --> 01:22:02,584
that will join you on your trip?

2107
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:03,884
(Why are all the cameras filming me?)

2108
01:22:04,614 --> 01:22:08,314
(When you said you will choose me as your companion 30 minutes ago,)

2109
01:22:08,314 --> 01:22:10,744
(I've never imagined I would be in this position.)

2110
01:22:11,144 --> 01:22:12,414
(He's thinking hard.)

2111
01:22:12,414 --> 01:22:14,344
- Why are you behind us? - Exactly.

2112
01:22:15,054 --> 01:22:17,054
(Let's see whose name tag is the softest.)

2113
01:22:17,744 --> 01:22:19,684
- You startled me. - Hey.

2114
01:22:19,684 --> 01:22:21,684
- Hey. You really startled me. - What are you doing?

2115
01:22:21,684 --> 01:22:24,884
- You are going too far. - Hey! What's wrong with you?

2116
01:22:24,884 --> 01:22:27,114
- Let's see whose name tag is loose. - Hey.

2117
01:22:27,114 --> 01:22:29,244
(She gets goosebumps.)

2118
01:22:29,614 --> 01:22:31,644
- Did you have fun today? - Hey.

2119
01:22:31,644 --> 01:22:33,944
- You had new members today. - It was fun.

2120
01:22:33,944 --> 01:22:35,844
What did you say before?

2121
01:22:35,844 --> 01:22:37,214
- I am the unluckiest? - Se Chan.

2122
01:22:37,214 --> 01:22:38,784
You really startled me.

2123
01:22:38,784 --> 01:22:42,784
Okay. I will be running from here...

2124
01:22:42,784 --> 01:22:45,844
- and remove that person's name tag. - Okay.

2125
01:22:45,844 --> 01:22:47,584
(This is nerve-wrecking.)

2126
01:22:47,944 --> 01:22:50,014
(Take care, Jae Seok.)

2127
01:22:50,414 --> 01:22:52,514
(Running Man is really fun.)

2128
01:22:53,054 --> 01:22:54,844
- Off I go. - Please.

2129
01:22:55,944 --> 01:22:57,644
(Who will get closer...)

2130
01:22:57,644 --> 01:23:00,744
(to the dangerous tourist attraction with Se Chan's Couple Tour Card?)

2131
01:23:09,144 --> 01:23:10,554
(No way!)

2132
01:23:11,114 --> 01:23:12,184
What?

2133
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:17,054
(Haha. Why don't you join me?)

2134
01:23:17,944 --> 01:23:19,944
(We survived!)

2135
01:23:21,014 --> 01:23:22,244
It was Haha.

2136
01:23:22,244 --> 01:23:23,484
(Jae Seok is safe.)

2137
01:23:23,584 --> 01:23:24,784
That was a good choice.

2138
01:23:24,784 --> 01:23:27,414
Haha. Spare me this once. I'm sorry.

2139
01:23:27,414 --> 01:23:28,744
(Haha encouraged him to change the briefcase.)

2140
01:23:28,744 --> 01:23:30,644
(Se Chan punished him with the Couple Tour Card.)

2141
01:23:30,644 --> 01:23:33,644
- That was great. - He picked the right person.

2142
01:23:33,644 --> 01:23:35,314
- We survived. - We did.

2143
01:23:36,054 --> 01:23:38,614
(Haha is mad.)

2144
01:23:40,944 --> 01:23:43,214
- You can do it! - That was a surprise.

2145
01:23:43,214 --> 01:23:45,984
Haha and Se Chan will each get...

2146
01:23:46,014 --> 01:23:49,554
one Tour Sticker for Global Race.

2147
01:23:50,244 --> 01:23:53,554
(Who will collect 3 Tour Stickers and go on the trip?)

2148
01:23:53,554 --> 01:23:56,114
(Few days later)

2149
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:58,314
(April 10 at Incheon International Airport)

2150
01:23:58,314 --> 01:24:00,144
We are at the airport.

2151
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,914
Are we really going to Osaka?

2152
01:24:02,244 --> 01:24:04,384
(They are half in doubt.)

2153
01:24:04,514 --> 01:24:05,644
- Take care. - Bye.

2154
01:24:05,644 --> 01:24:08,844
(Are we really saying goodbye here?)

2155
01:24:08,844 --> 01:24:10,784
- I guess they're really going. - Take care of them, So Min.

2156
01:24:10,784 --> 01:24:12,614
- Are you really going? - Take care, Ji Hyo.

2157
01:24:12,614 --> 01:24:16,054
- They are really going. - It's happening. What will we do?

2158
01:24:16,054 --> 01:24:19,214
- How can this happen? - Will we come back?

2159
01:24:19,214 --> 01:24:20,444
(Can we come back today?)

2160
01:24:20,554 --> 01:24:23,514
- I have a live radio show tomorrow. - I have to come back.

2161
01:24:23,514 --> 01:24:26,214
Ji Hyo. Once we go through here, we are really going.

2162
01:24:26,314 --> 01:24:28,784
- Haha. We already have our tickets. - We can't come back out.

2163
01:24:28,784 --> 01:24:30,414
(The staff suddenly informed them about their departure.)

2164
01:24:30,414 --> 01:24:33,114
(Did they really go abroad?)

2165
01:24:33,714 --> 01:24:35,314
(Few hours later)

2166
01:24:36,184 --> 01:24:39,484
(They really went! Having no twists is the element of the surprise.)

2167
01:24:39,484 --> 01:24:40,944
(They are in the center of Osaka.)

2168
01:24:40,944 --> 01:24:43,614
(Seok Jin, So Min, and Jae Seok are dispatched to Japan.)

2169
01:24:44,714 --> 01:24:46,984
(Welcome to Taiwan, the city of delicious food)

2170
01:24:46,984 --> 01:24:48,144
(A unique trip)

2171
01:24:48,144 --> 01:24:50,314
(Haha, Ji Hyo, and Se Chan are distracted to Taiwan.)

2172
01:24:50,684 --> 01:24:53,984
(On this island, there's a magnificent view of the blue sky.)

2173
01:24:53,984 --> 01:24:55,684
(Running Man members are here,)

2174
01:24:55,684 --> 01:24:57,844
(but it turns into a nature documentary.)

2175
01:24:57,944 --> 01:25:01,054
(Wondrous stories are unfolded on this wondrous island.)

2176
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:03,684
(Jong Kook, Do Yeon, and Kwang Soo are dispatched to this island.)

2177
01:25:03,684 --> 01:25:04,744
(To find the taste)

2178
01:25:04,744 --> 01:25:06,114
(To find the hidden mission)

2179
01:25:07,014 --> 01:25:08,114
(Body language)

2180
01:25:08,414 --> 01:25:09,944
I can already smell the food.

2181
01:25:09,944 --> 01:25:11,484
(Food trip in Osaka)

2182
01:25:11,644 --> 01:25:15,014
(They are overly motivated.)

2183
01:25:15,014 --> 01:25:16,054
(He runs into a pole.)

2184
01:25:17,214 --> 01:25:21,244
(The core of his motivation is damaged.)

2185
01:25:21,244 --> 01:25:23,984
(Jae Seok takes the lead since Seok Jin is injured.)

2186
01:25:23,984 --> 01:25:26,414
(Do you know that place?)

2187
01:25:27,554 --> 01:25:30,014
(She's kindly explaining it.)

2188
01:25:30,884 --> 01:25:34,314
(After listening to her)

2189
01:25:35,344 --> 01:25:37,614
(We can communicate telepathically in Osaka.)

2190
01:25:41,484 --> 01:25:44,014
(It's a blockbuster race on a global scale.)

2191
01:25:44,814 --> 01:25:47,444
(We are the world)

2192
01:25:48,244 --> 01:25:50,314
(Through this race, they become one with the whole world.)

2193
01:25:50,314 --> 01:25:52,384
He's a running man.

2194
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:53,644
(Ripping)

2195
01:25:53,644 --> 01:25:54,744
I ripped it.

2196
01:25:54,744 --> 01:25:56,014
(And)

2197
01:25:56,014 --> 01:25:58,384
(They discover a shrine of variety shows in Osaka.)

2198
01:25:59,984 --> 01:26:02,014
(Are they at a public bathhouse?)

2199
01:26:02,584 --> 01:26:03,944
I will be back.

2200
01:26:05,414 --> 01:26:06,414
Hey.

2201
01:26:07,214 --> 01:26:08,714
(He suddenly shows up on camera.)

2202
01:26:08,714 --> 01:26:11,784
(What is next week's mission that made them go naked?)

2203
01:26:11,844 --> 01:26:14,714
(Running Man)
