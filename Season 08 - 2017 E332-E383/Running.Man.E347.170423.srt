00:00:05,123 --> 00:00:07,863
(This is Running Man's global project of 2017.)

2
00:00:08,563 --> 00:00:10,593
(The world's deadliest tourist destinations rated by the bloggers)

(Insano water slide, Brazil)

10
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:32,093
(We are going to visit those places?)

11
00:00:32,093 --> 00:00:35,763
(With this global project, the show has moved to another level.)

12
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,029
(Last week)

13
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:42,029
(In this dangerous moment, Se Chan and So Min joined the cast.)

14
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:44,429
Don't do it. Don't!

15
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,199
(Se Chan looks like he's fully adjusted to the show.)

16
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:49,629
They said I'm the ugliest here.

17
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:53,499
(With his perfect looks for variety shows, he happens to be unlucky.)

18
00:00:54,099 --> 00:00:55,329
(With bad luck,)

19
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:59,059
(he and Haha receive 1 Tour Sticker each.)

20
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,059
(And today)

21
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:03,729
(What? You want us to leave right now?)

22
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:05,329
I didn't even buy the flight ticket.

23
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:07,399
(Are they really going overseas on the morning of the shoot?)

24
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:10,329
(They went indeed.)

25
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:13,599
(A specialized mission in Taiwan where the temperature is 34Â°C)

26
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:19,059

(Part 2 of the global project begins now!)

29
00:01:25,774 --> 00:01:27,408
(Everyone is asleep at this quiet dawn.)

30
00:01:27,408 --> 00:01:30,778
I slept briefly at home and woke up at 2am.

31
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:32,148
(Every member gathers at a hotel at 4am.)

32
00:01:32,148 --> 00:01:34,078
- This is too early in the morning. - It's cold.

33
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:37,078
- Please don't be mistaken. - We need one more person.

34
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:39,148
- We're filming at dawn, not night. - You should explain.

35
00:01:39,148 --> 00:01:42,248
When the sun rises, the viewers might be surprised to see the sun.

36
00:01:42,248 --> 00:01:44,648
- Even the sun hasn't risen yet. - The viewers may be flustered.

37
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:46,278
- They might think the show ended. - Right.

38
00:01:46,278 --> 00:01:48,878
We will tell you why we are filming early today.

39
00:01:48,878 --> 00:01:50,048
- You ought to. - Okay.

40
00:01:50,048 --> 00:01:51,678
Why did you tell us to bring our passport?

41
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,948
We have to get ready for the trip.

42
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:56,348
Someone will have to go three weeks later.

43
00:01:56,348 --> 00:01:58,978
- I don't believe him. - Today isn't the day though.

44
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:01,478
- We have two more shoots left. - We are researching in advance.

45
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:04,048
- That's why... - Strangely, we're near the airport.

46
00:02:04,048 --> 00:02:06,208
- This is weird. - What a coincidence, right?

47
00:02:06,248 --> 00:02:08,978
(What a coincidence, right?)

48
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:12,478
(What is that crazy producer plotting?)

49
00:02:12,478 --> 00:02:14,448
- Is someone leaving today? - What?

50
00:02:14,448 --> 00:02:16,248
- No way. This can't be happening. - Will there be two stickers?

51
00:02:16,248 --> 00:02:18,418
- Is today the last day? - It'll be two stickers and be over.

52
00:02:18,418 --> 00:02:20,378
- Really? - Yes.

53
00:02:22,178 --> 00:02:24,248
(We will get on a plane at Incheon International Airport...)

54
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:29,548
(and will be forced to head to this pit of fire today. Is that right?)

55
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:31,778
- This is crazy. You two are done. - That means...

56
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:34,308
- It will be Haha and Se Chan. - No way.

57
00:02:34,308 --> 00:02:36,448
- We have to film one more time. - It will be one of you.

58
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,978
- Perhaps, both of them will go. - By the way, last week...

59
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:41,978
after the shoot, one of the members...

60
00:02:41,978 --> 00:02:44,878
- sent a text late at night. - What did it say?

61
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,348
We showed you the possible destinations last week.

62
00:02:47,348 --> 00:02:49,948
The member recommended another destination in the text.

63
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:53,378
(These destinations are scary enough.)

64
00:02:53,378 --> 00:02:54,578
(Another destination?)

65
00:02:54,578 --> 00:02:56,708
- Who sent the text? - That was completely useless.

66
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,048
- Who is it? - Didn't you send it?

67
00:02:59,048 --> 00:03:01,378
Wait. If that person recommended it, he or she should go.

68
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:03,578
We will show you the recommended destination. Here it is.

69
00:03:03,578 --> 00:03:05,878
That person ought to go since he or she recommended it.

70
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:07,878
- That person will know this. - What is this?

71
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:10,678
- Is this it? - Where is it? I can't see.

72
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:14,178
- In which country is this? - Is this in the States?

73
00:03:14,178 --> 00:03:16,278
(The roller coaster climbs up briskly.)

74
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:17,578
- Goodness. - What is it?

75
00:03:17,578 --> 00:03:18,808
Seriously?

76
00:03:18,808 --> 00:03:20,578
- Isn't this too high? - It will drop from the top.

77
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:22,508
- Where is it? They are in the air. - This is in the States.

78
00:03:22,508 --> 00:03:25,348
(It drops vertically perpetually.)

79
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:27,078
(What is this merciless ride?)

80
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:28,708
- It keeps going down. - Goodness.

81
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,778
(What is the identity of this roller coaster heading to the underworld?)

82
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,278
- I can't ride this. - No way. I can't ride it.

83
00:03:34,278 --> 00:03:36,678
- Who sent you this? - This is impossible.

84
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:39,348
- Who recommended this ride? - Putting aside this ride...

85
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:41,348
- Who sent the text? - Is it you?

86
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:43,878
- You know I hate roller coasters. - Kwang Soo didn't send it.

87
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:46,078
- Did you send it, Seok Jin? - It has to be So Min.

88
00:03:46,078 --> 00:03:48,578
- Is it you, So Min? - I haven't even been in the US.

89
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:50,578
- It's not me. - Is it you, Se Chan?

90
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:52,408
- It's not me. - It has to be one of you.

91
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:54,148
- It can't never be me. It's not me. - You sent it, Haha. Right?

92
00:03:54,148 --> 00:03:56,878
- Isn't it you? - I swear I didn't recommend it.

93
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,308
- I swear I didn't recommend it. - Then it cannot be you.

94
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:01,878
Hey, then was it you?

95
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:04,308
Was it you? Did you recommend it?

96
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,078
It was you, Ji Hyo.

97
00:04:06,648 --> 00:04:08,608
- Gosh. You've gone mad. - Why did you do that?

98
00:04:08,608 --> 00:04:10,978
- Go there in your free time. - Just because you like it...

99
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:14,778
- How did you find this though? - Why did you do that?

100
00:04:14,778 --> 00:04:18,948
The ride you just saw is in Ohio, USA.

101
00:04:18,948 --> 00:04:20,978
- It's far. - It's called Top Thrill Dragster.

102
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:24,718
- This 130m tall ride drops... - What is this? Gosh.

103
00:04:24,718 --> 00:04:27,078
at a right angle. This is known to be the most brutal roller coaster.

104
00:04:27,078 --> 00:04:28,548
- This is crazy. - It's the most brutal.

105
00:04:28,548 --> 00:04:30,308
Did you know this when you sent it?

106
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:31,978
- I recommend her... - I didn't know.

107
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:33,008
to collect insects in Africa.

108
00:04:33,008 --> 00:04:35,608
(I recommend that Ji Hyo collects insects in Africa.)

109
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,978
- There are so many insects there. - I agree.

110
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,648
- There will be bugs all over her. - Let's see him getting bitten.

111
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:43,978
I recommend this ride for Kwang Soo.

112
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:46,878
I recommend that we make a situation where she has to eat the insects.

113
00:04:46,878 --> 00:04:50,078
I recommend that he rides the roller coaster without the safety bars.

114
00:04:50,078 --> 00:04:53,248
I recommend that he rides the roller coaster without the safety bars.

115
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:54,808
She wants me dead.

116
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:56,378
You wanted the same for me too.

117
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:58,678
Imagine you stay in the air when everyone else goes down.

118
00:04:58,678 --> 00:04:59,808
(Why are you bullying me too?)

119
00:04:59,808 --> 00:05:01,878
- It will be just like in a cartoon. - Right.

120
00:05:01,878 --> 00:05:05,308
(He'll savor the sweet taste of the gravity without the safety bars.)

121
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:07,718
- He will stay in the air. - You will fall later.

122
00:05:07,718 --> 00:05:09,948
Haha and Se Chan will most likely go.

123
00:05:09,948 --> 00:05:11,178
- No. - No way.

124
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,548
- This is driving me crazy. - You are the closest.

125
00:05:13,548 --> 00:05:15,178
- That can't happen. - Thank you.

126
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:16,778
(She feels bad.)

127
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:21,278
The race for these destinations will start today as well.

128
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:23,378
- That's horrible. - Today's mission will be...

129
00:05:23,378 --> 00:05:26,148
carried out by 3 teams. 3 members will make 1 team.

130
00:05:26,148 --> 00:05:30,508
(There are only 8 of us. How will we make 3 teams?)

131
00:05:30,508 --> 00:05:32,578
Even when we have two new members, it's not even.

132
00:05:32,578 --> 00:05:34,378
- Don't you need one more person? - What is it?

133
00:05:34,378 --> 00:05:36,548
- We invited a special guest. - Is someone coming?

134
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:39,148
We invited a beautiful lady to join us.

135
00:05:39,148 --> 00:05:40,778
(A beautiful lady will fill in the last spot?)

136
00:05:42,248 --> 00:05:44,708
- I was about to say that... - A beautiful guest.

137
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:48,078
new members haven't adjusted yet and we shouldn't call a new guest.

138
00:05:48,078 --> 00:05:50,608
- I don't want to say that anymore. - There will be a beautiful guest.

139
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:53,578
- I changed my mind. - Who is the beautiful guest?

140
00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:56,148
- We will move to meet the princess. - The princess?

141
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,248
(Who is the princess that will join them on the dangerous trip?)

142
00:05:58,248 --> 00:05:59,908
- Let's go. - I'm curious to find out.

143
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:03,908
(Current time is 4:46am.)

144
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:08,348
(They are walking towards the princess with fluttering hearts.)

145
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:10,548
(At the end of the path, who will be waiting for the members?)

146
00:06:10,548 --> 00:06:12,978
- We are doing this again. - Again?

147
00:06:14,848 --> 00:06:16,348
(Is it the belt from last week?)

148
00:06:16,348 --> 00:06:18,508
- What is it? - Please sit comfortably.

149
00:06:18,648 --> 00:06:22,278
(The advanced belt that delivered them to the dangerous next door)

150
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:26,448
- There are 2 belts. - There are 2 ways.

151
00:06:26,448 --> 00:06:30,548
All right. The princess you have been waiting for is...

152
00:06:30,548 --> 00:06:32,978
- in the room you see in front. - In that room?

153
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:34,808
- She's in that room. - There she is.

154
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,048
- It's nice to meet you. - What?

155
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:40,708
(It's nice to meet you.)

156
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,978
- I like her laugh. - She sounds cute.

157
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:45,148
- I really like her laugh. - She sounds really cute.

158
00:06:45,548 --> 00:06:48,178
I think I heard her laugh a lot from somewhere.

159
00:06:48,178 --> 00:06:50,178
Can you laugh one more time?

160
00:06:50,408 --> 00:06:53,448
I will laugh when I want to.

161
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:57,078
(I will laugh when I want to.)

162
00:06:57,078 --> 00:06:59,808
- She sounds a bit weird. - Isn't she Hong Yun Hwa?

163
00:06:59,808 --> 00:07:02,878
She must have appeared on a lot of variety shows.

164
00:07:02,878 --> 00:07:05,248
- I don't think she's an actress. - You think so?

165
00:07:05,248 --> 00:07:08,378
- Her laugh sounds so familiar. - It does for me too.

166
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:11,948
(Who is this mysterious princess that lets out a cute laugh?)

167
00:07:12,678 --> 00:07:15,278
All right. I will reveal today's mission.

168
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:18,348
- What is it? - Part two of the global project.

169
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:20,208
The mission is Dangerous Princess.

170
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:23,678
In order for you to meet the princess,

171
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:26,178
you have to accomplish the mission.

172
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:29,548
Here are the rules. Each one of you will write one questionnaire...

173
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:33,308
about a topic in which you think you will be ranked first.

174
00:07:33,308 --> 00:07:35,448
The princess will choose the topic randomly...

175
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:37,578
and personally rank the members.

176
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:41,808
The member ranked first will receive a Golden Badge.

177
00:07:43,008 --> 00:07:46,548
The member ranked last and the members on the same belt...

178
00:07:46,548 --> 00:07:49,148
will be dragged to the dangerous next door and face the penalty.

179
00:07:49,148 --> 00:07:50,948
- Good. Kwang Soo is on that belt. - Jae Seok.

180
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:52,378
Everyone on the same belt will face the penalty?

181
00:07:52,378 --> 00:07:54,348
(They must predict their ranking and choose their seat.)

182
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,978
She might answer the questions differently though.

183
00:07:56,978 --> 00:07:58,708
I have played this game before.

184
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,978
I can write a question I know for certain I will be ranked first.

185
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:01,978
There are so many questions.

186
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:04,578
- Questions I will be ranked first? - I have to...

187
00:08:04,578 --> 00:08:06,248
It's not easy to write one.

188
00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:08,178
I don't have any special traits.

189
00:08:08,178 --> 00:08:10,678
- So Min, that's not true. - Questions I will be ranked first?

190
00:08:10,678 --> 00:08:11,808
(Everyone finishes writing the questions.)

191
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:12,808
(Kwang Soo, The person you want to kiss the most)

192
00:08:12,808 --> 00:08:13,808
(So Min, The member who has the lowest income)

193
00:08:13,808 --> 00:08:14,878
(Jong Kook, The one you want to go to a jungle with)

194
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:15,908
(Ji Hyo, The one you think has a short temper)

195
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:16,908
(Seok Jin, The one you think looks good in glasses)

196
00:08:17,178 --> 00:08:19,878
- She's reading them, right? - Who is this princess though?

197
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:21,308
- Princess. - Yes?

198
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:23,878
Please tell us what you chose for the first topic.

199
00:08:24,048 --> 00:08:26,748
The first topic that I've chosen...

200
00:08:26,748 --> 00:08:27,978
- is... - She sounds familiar.

201
00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:29,878
- I think I recognize her voice. - Me too.

202
00:08:29,878 --> 00:08:30,878
Is it Bo Mi?

203
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:33,248
It's the person I want to kiss the most.

204
00:08:34,378 --> 00:08:36,408
- Who wrote this? - That's the topic.

205
00:08:36,408 --> 00:08:37,408
- Okay. - We can't say it out loud, right?

206
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:40,048
- You guys can rank yourselves. - We rank ourselves?

207
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:41,278
- Move over. - Hey, move.

208
00:08:41,408 --> 00:08:42,978
- Move. - Be honest.

209
00:08:42,978 --> 00:08:44,508
- Everyone thinks I have great lips. - Get out of my place.

210
00:08:44,548 --> 00:08:47,648
I'll be honest. I've had a lot of women kiss me first.

211
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:49,248
What are you talking about?

212
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:51,048
I got married thanks to my lips.

213
00:08:52,178 --> 00:08:54,208
I'm being serious. Jae Seok, come on.

214
00:08:54,348 --> 00:08:56,148
- My lips... - That's such a lie.

215
00:08:56,148 --> 00:08:59,848
- My bottom lip is so plump. - Stop talking nonsense.

216
00:08:59,848 --> 00:09:01,978
- So Min, why are you sitting there? - Move.

217
00:09:01,978 --> 00:09:03,478
- Seok Jin, let's be serious. - Move over.

218
00:09:03,478 --> 00:09:06,008
- My gosh, these two are so brazen. - Get out of my seat.

219
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:07,778
- They must be crazy. - Move over.

220
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:09,478
- Get out of my seat. - My lips are like latex.

221
00:09:09,478 --> 00:09:11,008
- Get out of my seat. - You should avoid...

222
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,548
sitting in the same line as the person who comes last.

223
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:16,408
- You sit here. I'll be the second. - Okay.

224
00:09:16,408 --> 00:09:18,078
- You can sit next to me. - What are you doing?

225
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:19,408
- Move! - You honestly...

226
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:20,678
- It's my seat! - You honestly deserve it.

227
00:09:20,678 --> 00:09:22,178
- Fine, I'll be the third. - Okay.

228
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:23,348
How are you the third?

229
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:25,908
Fine, I'll be the fourth then.

230
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,648
Okay, I'll be the fourth.

231
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:30,578
I forgot to put on lip balm today.

232
00:09:30,878 --> 00:09:32,448
I should've put on lip balm today.

233
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:34,378
Who put it on? Let me use it too.

234
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,878
Did you finish writing down their names?

235
00:09:36,348 --> 00:09:38,178
Yes, I finished ranking them.

236
00:09:38,648 --> 00:09:41,178
- You guys must be nervous. - Yes.

237
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:43,748
- I'll announce the ranking. - Okay.

238
00:09:44,478 --> 00:09:45,978
The person who came in first is...

239
00:09:47,148 --> 00:09:52,848
(You've seen how charming our lips are, right?)

240
00:09:52,848 --> 00:09:55,348
- Congratulations, Ji Hyo. - I told you.

241
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:57,048
(She has the most charming lips.)

242
00:09:57,078 --> 00:09:58,508
- Thank you. - No.

243
00:09:58,508 --> 00:10:01,208
- Thank you. - It's hard for her to choose a guy.

244
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,248
- It's hard for her to choose a guy. - May I continue?

245
00:10:04,248 --> 00:10:05,348
- Yes. - Yes.

246
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:06,748
- The person who came in second... - It's probably So Min.

247
00:10:06,748 --> 00:10:08,578
- is So Min. - See? I told you.

248
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:11,178
- That's so unfair. - She's being unfair.

249
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:13,678
- She's being unfair. - I'm so nervous.

250
00:10:13,678 --> 00:10:16,248
- Please calm down, everyone. - You should be more honest.

251
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:18,348
- She's trying to seem naive. - I can't believe this.

252
00:10:18,348 --> 00:10:20,378
I'm sure the next person was supposed to be number one.

253
00:10:20,748 --> 00:10:22,678
I'll announce the next person.

254
00:10:23,478 --> 00:10:26,408
- The person who came in third is... - This is the real deal.

255
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:32,378
(Who will come in first among the male members?)

256
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:33,948
- It's Haha! - I knew it.

257
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:36,848
This princess really knows what she's talking about.

258
00:10:36,848 --> 00:10:38,408
- I'm being serious. - What are you talking about?

259
00:10:38,408 --> 00:10:41,148
- She's trying to save her face. - She's not being honest.

260
00:10:41,148 --> 00:10:42,778
- She's just trying to be nice. - No, she's being honest.

261
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:46,408
I used to say that my ideal kind of woman is Ms. Kim Hye Ja.

262
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:48,408
- She's just trying to play safe. - I know.

263
00:10:48,408 --> 00:10:50,548
She's the type that wants to play safe.

264
00:10:51,048 --> 00:10:52,778
- Who came in fourth? - This is so funny.

265
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:55,578
The person who came in fourth is Jae Seok.

266
00:10:55,578 --> 00:10:57,778
(Jae Seok ranks 4th on the list.)

267
00:10:58,548 --> 00:11:00,578
You see that? She's only trying to save her face.

268
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:02,578
- She's being serious, right? - Okay, fine.

269
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,848
- She's being absolutely serious. - I think I'm going to come in last.

270
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:10,508
(Only 30 seconds ago, he was busy criticizing her.)

271
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,848
(But he quickly changes his attitude.)

272
00:11:13,848 --> 00:11:15,178
She's not joking at all.

273
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,478
I didn't know she'd be so cunning.

274
00:11:19,348 --> 00:11:23,078
Please announce who ranked last. Everyone on that line will lose.

275
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:26,608
I'm sorry, but the last person on the list is...

276
00:11:26,608 --> 00:11:28,348
(It's either Kwang Soo or Se Chan.)

277
00:11:28,348 --> 00:11:34,248
(Which line will end up getting a group penalty?)

278
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:35,878
It's Kwang Soo.

279
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:37,208
(Kwang Soo ranks last on the list.)

280
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,748
(Everyone sitting on the same line as Kwang Soo will get penalized.)

281
00:11:39,748 --> 00:11:41,808
- I'm sorry. - I came in last?

282
00:11:42,878 --> 00:11:45,208
(The 4 men who fought over the seats enter the dangerous room.)

283
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,978
- This doesn't make any sense. - I should've sat there.

284
00:11:48,378 --> 00:11:50,048
- She should be more honest. - I can't believe this.

285
00:11:50,048 --> 00:11:51,978
- What is this? - Bye

286
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,978
(I hope you return safely.)

287
00:11:57,748 --> 00:11:59,878
- It's not because I'm scared. - My goodness.

288
00:12:00,248 --> 00:12:01,578
My gosh, Kwang Soo.

289
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:03,278
What is this?

290
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:04,378
(What did they encounter?)

291
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:08,578
- I think she's going to be pretty. - Yes, I agree.

292
00:12:08,678 --> 00:12:11,508
She might even be an actress.

293
00:12:11,548 --> 00:12:13,248
- Please send them back out. - Do you think so?

294
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:14,608
This is unbelievable.

295
00:12:14,678 --> 00:12:16,708
Tell her that she should be more honest.

296
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,108
(Shocking)

297
00:12:20,778 --> 00:12:22,648
- My goodness, look at them. - They look so pretty.

298
00:12:23,448 --> 00:12:25,308
Tell her that she should be honest.

299
00:12:25,308 --> 00:12:26,608
You guys look pretty.

300
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:28,108
- He looks so cheap. - My goodness.

301
00:12:28,608 --> 00:12:30,108
She really should be more honest.

302
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:33,148
- You guys look pretty. - This is ridiculous.

303
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:38,078
May I tell you why Seok Jin had a low rank?

304
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:39,378
- Yes, please tell us. - Yes.

305
00:12:39,478 --> 00:12:43,248
I think Seok Jin's lips...

306
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:47,678
will feel a bit soggy.

307
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:51,878
(She shocks them with the word "soggy".)

308
00:12:51,878 --> 00:12:54,308
- "Soggy"? - My goodness.

309
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:56,708
She's one weird lady.

310
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:57,878
I'm sorry.

311
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:59,508
- It's because... - Your lips do look soggy.

312
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:02,378
They're not soggy. They're moist.

313
00:13:02,378 --> 00:13:05,308
- They look very damp. - Exactly.

314
00:13:05,748 --> 00:13:07,908
- She's an eloquent speaker. - Wait.

315
00:13:08,678 --> 00:13:10,048
Is she Do Yeon?

316
00:13:10,178 --> 00:13:11,908
- Do Yeon? - She sounds like her.

317
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:13,748
She talks like Do Yeon.

318
00:13:13,748 --> 00:13:14,948
- He's right. - Right?

319
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:16,078
Hey, Do Yeon.

320
00:13:16,308 --> 00:13:18,008
(You're all curious, aren't you?)

321
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:19,908
She sounds like Do Yeon.

322
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:21,578
- She does talk like her. - I agree.

323
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:22,948
- Do Yeon tends to... - Right.

324
00:13:22,948 --> 00:13:25,708
- She uses words like "soggy". - Yes, she does.

325
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,908
- Go ahead. - The next topic I chose is...

326
00:13:30,148 --> 00:13:34,278
the person who seems to earn the least amount of money.

327
00:13:35,178 --> 00:13:37,208
- The person who earns the least? - Isn't it you, So Min?

328
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,678
- Who wrote this? - It's So Min.

329
00:13:38,678 --> 00:13:40,048
I wrote it!

330
00:13:40,408 --> 00:13:42,008
You might not come in first.

331
00:13:42,008 --> 00:13:45,178
- She probably has her own standard. - Everyone.

332
00:13:45,178 --> 00:13:48,478
I'm not aware of how much money you guys all earn.

333
00:13:48,478 --> 00:13:51,078
Therefore, I'll be writing the list based on your outer appearances.

334
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:54,848
Our appearances? That means it's not based on actual facts.

335
00:13:54,878 --> 00:13:56,848
Then we need to change seats.

336
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,308
What's wrong with my appearance?

337
00:13:59,748 --> 00:14:00,978
Do I look poor?

338
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:04,148
- This is confusing. - So Min should come down.

339
00:14:04,148 --> 00:14:05,548
We really can't predict anything.

340
00:14:05,548 --> 00:14:07,878
- Your eyes are fine, right? - Yes, they're fine.

341
00:14:07,878 --> 00:14:12,208
The person who I think earns the least amount of money is...

342
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:16,378
(Who does she think is the poorest member?)

343
00:14:16,378 --> 00:14:17,878
It's Seok Jin.

344
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:20,208
Congratulations.

345
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,278
- Why? - Hey.

346
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,448
Right now,

347
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:26,308
he befits that image because of how he looks.

348
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:28,908
(Seok Jin is penniless and has soggy lips.)

349
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:31,648
- Excuse me, do you think... - Yes?

350
00:14:31,648 --> 00:14:33,548
Does it seem like I'll earn less money than Se Chan?

351
00:14:34,008 --> 00:14:36,908
Well, Se Chan is still young...

352
00:14:36,908 --> 00:14:40,908
and has a longer life ahead of him.

353
00:14:40,908 --> 00:14:42,008
(She's very logical.)

354
00:14:42,008 --> 00:14:43,808
- She's right. - I'm sorry.

355
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:45,478
- I'm still young. - Right.

356
00:14:45,478 --> 00:14:47,508
- She's realistic. - That makes sense.

357
00:14:47,508 --> 00:14:49,478
- She's very logical. - I'm sorry.

358
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:52,178
- I'll announce who came in last. - Listen up.

359
00:14:52,178 --> 00:14:53,808
- It's probably Jae Seok. - The last person on the list is...

360
00:14:53,808 --> 00:14:55,548
(Who does she think earns the most amount of money?)

361
00:14:55,548 --> 00:14:56,978
It's Jae Seok.

362
00:14:56,978 --> 00:14:59,308
(Jae Seok ranks last on the list.)

363
00:14:59,308 --> 00:15:00,448
You just came in last.

364
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,148
- You shouldn't be happy. - It's a bad thing.

365
00:15:03,148 --> 00:15:04,948
- Bye. - See you.

366
00:15:05,678 --> 00:15:07,378
(Ji Hyo, Haha, Jae Seok, and Jong Kook will get penalized.)

367
00:15:07,378 --> 00:15:08,708
I'm happy with being the seventh.

368
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,908
(Ji Hyo, Haha, Jae Seok, and Jong Kook will get penalized.)

369
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:14,478
I came in first, but I it doesn't feel so great.

370
00:15:14,978 --> 00:15:16,178
(Screaming)

371
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:18,108
- It must be something painful. - I think they're getting a massage.

372
00:15:18,248 --> 00:15:19,348
Maybe they're getting pinched.

373
00:15:19,348 --> 00:15:20,478
My goodness.

374
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,778
My goodness.

375
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:26,708
(Who could it be?)

376
00:15:26,948 --> 00:15:30,508
(Who is this familiar person?)

377
00:15:31,178 --> 00:15:36,478
(He's responsible for taking care of the members' health.)

378
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:41,348
(He's Masseur Kim Hyung Joon, the master of sports massage.)

379
00:15:41,348 --> 00:15:42,908
- Please don't hurt us. - My goodness.

380
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,148
I'll try to endure it.

381
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:46,408
(Screaming)

382
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,878
(Along with his students, he gives them a massage.)

383
00:15:49,878 --> 00:15:51,308
(Screaming)

384
00:15:51,308 --> 00:15:52,548
My gosh, stop.

385
00:15:52,548 --> 00:15:54,078
(Electrifying)

386
00:15:55,348 --> 00:15:56,608
It must be painful.

387
00:15:57,578 --> 00:15:58,948
It must hurt a lot.

388
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:00,978
- Be careful. - They're coming.

389
00:16:00,978 --> 00:16:03,448
- What was the penalty? - We got a sports massage.

390
00:16:03,448 --> 00:16:04,808
- I see. - Sports massage?

391
00:16:04,808 --> 00:16:06,778
I shouldn't have cried for joy.

392
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:09,748
- Why were you happy? - He thought it was a compliment.

393
00:16:09,748 --> 00:16:11,308
I thought it was a compliment.

394
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:12,478
(He was excited for a split moment.)

395
00:16:13,008 --> 00:16:16,008
(Next topic is the one looks like they'll have a short temper.)

396
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:20,108
(They each try their best to show her their temper.)

397
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:23,478
(Jong Kook comes in last, so Ji Hyo, Haha, and Kwang Soo get penalized.)

398
00:16:23,878 --> 00:16:25,978
- The princess... - She makes bad decisions.

399
00:16:25,978 --> 00:16:29,548
- Why didn't Jae Seok come in last? - I ranked first on the list.

400
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:31,478
How old are you?

401
00:16:31,508 --> 00:16:33,478
I'm old enough.

402
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:35,648
Hey, Do Yeon.

403
00:16:35,648 --> 00:16:36,848
I think she's Do Yeon.

404
00:16:36,848 --> 00:16:38,378
- It's not her. - She sounds like Do Yeon.

405
00:16:38,378 --> 00:16:40,348
- It must be her. - How tall are you?

406
00:16:40,478 --> 00:16:41,948
Your foot size is 280mm, right?

407
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:44,078
- 280mm? - Yes.

408
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:45,278
You're funny.

409
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:47,178
(She thinks he's funny.)

410
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:48,608
(That has to be Do Yeon.)

411
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,108
- She's definitely Do Yeon. - It's Do Yeon.

412
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:51,778
- She's Do Yeon. - Her foot size is 280mm.

413
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:54,548
The way she just laughed. Her laugh sounded familiar.

414
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:56,548
I agree with everyone else, but not with Jong Kook.

415
00:16:58,678 --> 00:17:00,608
I agree with everyone else, but not with Jong Kook.

416
00:17:00,608 --> 00:17:02,048
(They return with shocking appearances.)

417
00:17:02,548 --> 00:17:04,908
(It's both shocking and scary.)

418
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:07,678
- I can't agree with Jong Kook. - Do Yeon, this is too much.

419
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:09,108
- Look at Ji Hyo! - This is ridiculous.

420
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:11,348
- Do Yeon. - Do Yeon, this is too much.

421
00:17:11,348 --> 00:17:12,808
Look at Ji Hyo!

422
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:15,848
- My gosh, Do Yeon. - How can you do this me, Do Yeon?

423
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:17,848
- I treat you nicely. - Good job.

424
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:21,848
(This is fun.)

425
00:17:22,648 --> 00:17:23,808
- Hey! - Ji Hyo.

426
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,778
I'll deal with you once you come out.

427
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,708
- Seriously. - I'm not going to let this pass.

428
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,078
She's not a princess. She's just a giant.

429
00:17:30,748 --> 00:17:33,018
It's been a while since I've seen Kwang Soo like this.

430
00:17:33,248 --> 00:17:36,078
- He looked like this before. - We wore green sweatsuits.

431
00:17:36,078 --> 00:17:37,408
(He looks very familiar now.)

432
00:17:38,248 --> 00:17:41,518
(In 2013, he came out looking like the stupidest person on Earth.)

433
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,948
(He was bald and wore green sweatsuits.)

434
00:17:43,948 --> 00:17:45,978
Yes, that's right. I remember.

435
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:47,278
(He's back.)

436
00:17:47,278 --> 00:17:50,018
- This is nice. - You used to look like this.

437
00:17:50,378 --> 00:17:54,548
But I noticed that Do Yeon...

438
00:17:54,548 --> 00:17:55,608
(They've already decided that she's Do Yeon.)

439
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:56,948
- We know her now. - It's her.

440
00:17:56,948 --> 00:18:00,148
I don't understand why you think I'm Jang Do Yeon.

441
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:01,578
I can smell your feet from here.

442
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:04,018
- Does her feet smell? - Really?

443
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:06,308
- Her feet stink. - I see.

444
00:18:06,308 --> 00:18:08,448
It's Do Yeon whose foot size is 280mm and has stinky feet.

445
00:18:08,448 --> 00:18:11,148
- Her foot size is similar to mine. - She has bigger feet than I do.

446
00:18:11,978 --> 00:18:14,748
- Is she really Do Yeon? - She must be.

447
00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:16,578
(Is the princess really Jang Do Yeon?)

448
00:18:17,018 --> 00:18:18,248
Come on out.

449
00:18:18,248 --> 00:18:19,408
(The princess finally reveals herself.)

450
00:18:19,408 --> 00:18:20,808
Bigfoot.

451
00:18:21,608 --> 00:18:23,348
Why do they keep saying I'm Jang Do Yeon?

452
00:18:25,248 --> 00:18:26,678
If not, I'm very sorry.

453
00:18:26,878 --> 00:18:28,148
It's definitely Do Yeon.

454
00:18:28,578 --> 00:18:29,648
(Who's the one with stinky feet?)

455
00:18:29,648 --> 00:18:31,478
- I knew it. - Hello.

456
00:18:31,548 --> 00:18:32,648
It's definitely Do Yeon.

457
00:18:32,648 --> 00:18:33,878
(Dangerous Princess is Jang Do Yeon.)

458
00:18:33,878 --> 00:18:36,078
- I knew it. - Hello.

459
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:37,978
She has big feet.

460
00:18:37,978 --> 00:18:41,408
The princess is Jang Do Yeon with big feet.

461
00:18:42,248 --> 00:18:44,108
It was Jang Do Yeon after all.

462
00:18:44,108 --> 00:18:45,978
(Dangerous Princess is Jang Do Yeon.)

463
00:18:45,978 --> 00:18:47,948
Each woman will be a team leader.

464
00:18:47,948 --> 00:18:50,978
You'll be divided into three groups. Let's go.

465
00:18:50,978 --> 00:18:52,478
- Okay. - Three women?

466
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:54,408
(What's the dangerous mission that awaits them?)

467
00:18:55,018 --> 00:18:57,078
The sun is finally rising.

468
00:18:58,678 --> 00:19:02,548
With Ji Hyo, Do Yeon, and So Min as team leaders,

469
00:19:02,678 --> 00:19:04,878
you'll compete with three members on each team.

470
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:06,248
- Really? - Yes.

471
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,878
The mission to determine the teams...

472
00:19:08,078 --> 00:19:10,078
is called You're My Cinderella.

473
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,018
- What is it? - Cinderella?

474
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,578
It must be related to shoes. Are your feet okay, Do Yeon?

475
00:19:15,608 --> 00:19:17,018
- No way. - It relates to shoes.

476
00:19:17,018 --> 00:19:18,248
- Stop it. - You have a disadvantage.

477
00:19:18,248 --> 00:19:19,708
Her feet are big and stinky.

478
00:19:20,178 --> 00:19:21,448
That's Do Yeon.

479
00:19:21,448 --> 00:19:22,808
This is terrible.

480
00:19:23,048 --> 00:19:25,778
Any part of the skin can smell.

481
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:28,148
On the 11th floor of this hotel,

482
00:19:28,248 --> 00:19:30,208
three pairs of glass slippers...

483
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,908
for the princesses are hidden.

484
00:19:32,518 --> 00:19:34,878
Male members are given 10 minutes to find the slippers...

485
00:19:34,978 --> 00:19:37,448
that belong to the princess they want to choose.

486
00:19:37,448 --> 00:19:38,778
Come back here once you find them.

487
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,808
While the male members look for the slippers,

488
00:19:40,808 --> 00:19:42,408
the team leaders will compete...

489
00:19:42,408 --> 00:19:43,878
by shelling pumpkin seeds.

490
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:45,978
The one who shells the most pumpkin seeds...

491
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:47,848
will get a Chance Card.

492
00:19:47,908 --> 00:19:50,848
The princesses may sit here and shell pumpkin seeds.

493
00:19:50,908 --> 00:19:53,878
The male members will look for glass slippers for 10 minutes.

494
00:19:53,878 --> 00:19:58,308
Will Seok Jin draw us in the meantime?

495
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,448
Stop it.

496
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,948
- Like that painter? - Remember him?

497
00:20:00,948 --> 00:20:02,608
I remember that painter.

498
00:20:02,608 --> 00:20:03,748
- That painter? - Yes.

499
00:20:03,748 --> 00:20:05,148
- Today, - Let's draw.

500
00:20:05,148 --> 00:20:06,648
maybe he has an exhibition.

501
00:20:06,648 --> 00:20:08,678
(He dances like a fool.)

502
00:20:08,678 --> 00:20:10,078
I'm sorry, Seok Jin.

503
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:12,308
Don't you know who the painter is?

504
00:20:12,308 --> 00:20:14,108
- I don't. - He's a fool.

505
00:20:14,248 --> 00:20:15,948
Maybe he's a fool.

506
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,108
- Maybe he's a fool. - Don't you know him?

507
00:20:17,478 --> 00:20:19,178
(Whom are they talking about?)

508
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:21,348
I was wondering why he was acting this way.

509
00:20:21,348 --> 00:20:23,078
He thought we called him a fool.

510
00:20:23,078 --> 00:20:24,408
- Come on, Seok Jin. - He thought we said a fool.

511
00:20:24,408 --> 00:20:27,678
- What was he doing? - He was acting like a fool.

512
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:31,348
That's enough. Let's go.

513
00:20:31,348 --> 00:20:32,708
(He goes to look for the slippers.)

514
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:33,908
That's outdated.

515
00:20:35,148 --> 00:20:37,348
- Let's go. - Did you mean that painter?

516
00:20:37,948 --> 00:20:39,908
You have 10 minutes.

517
00:20:40,018 --> 00:20:42,518
Do Yeon's slippers will be stinky.

518
00:20:42,518 --> 00:20:43,748
- They'll definitely stink. - They'll be 180mm.

519
00:20:43,748 --> 00:20:45,348
No, they're 280mm.

520
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,608
Is this a room?

521
00:20:46,608 --> 00:20:48,708
(The slippers are hidden somewhere.)

522
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,108
This is amazing.

523
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:52,178
(The slippers are hidden somewhere.)

524
00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:54,578
(It's great in here.)

525
00:20:55,248 --> 00:20:56,578
Are they glass slippers?

526
00:20:57,348 --> 00:20:59,308
We haven't searched for things in a long time.

527
00:20:59,648 --> 00:21:01,678
(He looks around thoroughly.)

528
00:21:01,948 --> 00:21:03,648
I'm careless when I search.

529
00:21:03,648 --> 00:21:04,708
Right.

530
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:07,378
(He finds things even when he searches carelessly.)

531
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:10,948
(He peeks inside.)

532
00:21:10,948 --> 00:21:11,978
What?

533
00:21:11,978 --> 00:21:14,278
(He finds a box in the fridge.)

534
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:15,878
It's here.

535
00:21:18,348 --> 00:21:21,078
(He finds So Min's slipper.)

536
00:21:22,378 --> 00:21:25,478
(Kwang Soo searches in the bathroom.)

537
00:21:25,478 --> 00:21:26,518
What?

538
00:21:26,878 --> 00:21:29,148
(He finds a box under the bathroom sink.)

539
00:21:29,608 --> 00:21:32,848
(To whom does the slipper belong?)

540
00:21:33,978 --> 00:21:36,078
Get ready, set, go.

541
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:37,678
(The princesses start the competition.)

542
00:21:37,678 --> 00:21:39,048
How do I shell them?

543
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,048
(Snap)

544
00:21:40,248 --> 00:21:42,348
I'll just shell them.

545
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:44,748
Does it still count if the seed breaks in half?

546
00:21:44,848 --> 00:21:46,578
I'll eat those that break.

547
00:21:46,778 --> 00:21:47,908
How do I shell them?

548
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:50,678
Shelling pumpkin seeds can be boring.

549
00:21:51,148 --> 00:21:54,148
Who do you want to join your team?

550
00:21:54,248 --> 00:21:56,448
I hope it won't be Seok Jin.

551
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,778
Why not?

552
00:21:57,778 --> 00:21:59,678
Seok Jin is very needy.

553
00:22:00,578 --> 00:22:02,748
During the beginning of the show,

554
00:22:02,848 --> 00:22:04,508
he looked exhausted already.

555
00:22:04,848 --> 00:22:08,848
(He's too old for clearing missions.)

556
00:22:08,848 --> 00:22:11,848
No one wants Seok Jin to join her team.

557
00:22:11,848 --> 00:22:13,508
- Right. - Is that what we all think?

558
00:22:13,508 --> 00:22:14,508
That's right.

559
00:22:14,508 --> 00:22:16,378
He needs to be taken care of all the time.

560
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,478
- That's true. - What about you, So Min?

561
00:22:18,478 --> 00:22:20,908
I was always on the same team with Kwang Soo.

562
00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:23,408
I want to work with someone else this time.

563
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,448
He always makes me nervous.

564
00:22:25,448 --> 00:22:26,978
I know what you mean.

565
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,808
You never know when he'll betray you.

566
00:22:29,908 --> 00:22:31,078
He makes people nervous.

567
00:22:31,078 --> 00:22:32,608
We could say he's Cheap Lover.

568
00:22:33,008 --> 00:22:35,508
- Cheap Lover? - It sounds offensive.

569
00:22:36,348 --> 00:22:39,208
- Cheap Lover? - He falls in love easily.

570
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,608
(They concentrate.)

571
00:22:41,448 --> 00:22:43,608
Can we go home even if we don't shell everything?

572
00:22:43,908 --> 00:22:46,708
(Can we move on to the next mission?)

573
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:48,978
Are you really doing it?

574
00:22:48,978 --> 00:22:50,708
Are you shelling pumpkin seeds?

575
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,148
They're shelling pumpkin seeds.

576
00:22:52,148 --> 00:22:53,548
Was that the real mission?

577
00:22:53,548 --> 00:22:55,478
So Min, you hardly shelled anything.

578
00:22:55,478 --> 00:22:56,878
So Min ate some.

579
00:22:57,148 --> 00:22:59,848
So Min does so many strange things.

580
00:22:59,848 --> 00:23:01,648
(Time is up for You're My Cinderella.)

581
00:23:01,778 --> 00:23:04,508
It's time to announce to whom the glass slippers...

582
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,248
- belong. - Okay.

583
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,678
Mine belongs to Do Yeon.

584
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,008
(He's on Do Yeon's team.)

585
00:23:10,008 --> 00:23:12,478
She's my soul mate.

586
00:23:13,648 --> 00:23:14,678
It's Ji Hyo.

587
00:23:14,678 --> 00:23:16,778
(Haha is on Ji Hyo's team.)

588
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:18,978
Did you know they were in a love triangle at first?

589
00:23:19,408 --> 00:23:22,148
- She made my heart flutter. - We were in a love triangle.

590
00:23:22,148 --> 00:23:23,248
(We look forward to their teamwork.)

591
00:23:23,348 --> 00:23:24,678
(Team leaders)

592
00:23:24,678 --> 00:23:27,848
(The members on each team)

593
00:23:27,848 --> 00:23:30,148
Here's the result for shelling pumpkin seeds.

594
00:23:30,148 --> 00:23:31,508
Ji Hyo shelled the most.

595
00:23:31,508 --> 00:23:33,708
That wasn't the real mission.

596
00:23:35,508 --> 00:23:37,648
That wasn't the real mission.

597
00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:38,708
What is it then?

598
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,748
(What was the real mission?)

599
00:23:39,748 --> 00:23:42,008
(Their shelling effort was in vain.)

600
00:23:42,008 --> 00:23:45,108
In the meantime, I asked them a few questions.

601
00:23:45,108 --> 00:23:47,078
They shelled pumpkin seeds while answering.

602
00:23:47,548 --> 00:23:48,578
I see.

603
00:23:48,578 --> 00:23:49,908
They also badmouthed other members.

604
00:23:50,008 --> 00:23:51,048
Is that what they did?

605
00:23:51,048 --> 00:23:53,608
- This isn't a mission. - So Min is the best at it.

606
00:23:53,678 --> 00:23:55,148
Let's start with Do Yeon.

607
00:23:55,548 --> 00:23:57,378
She made comments twice.

608
00:23:57,378 --> 00:23:58,478
- Twice? - Is that all?

609
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,008
She agreed with the others once.

610
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,278
- I agreed? - She agreed?

611
00:24:01,478 --> 00:24:03,408
- She agreed with them. - I see.

612
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,078
Ji Hyo agrees with others a lot.

613
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:06,908
- You say, "That's right." - I agree with people a lot.

614
00:24:06,908 --> 00:24:08,848
- Is it a reaction? - Next is So Min.

615
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:10,748
- It's revealing. - I'm sure she talked a lot.

616
00:24:10,748 --> 00:24:12,108
She made comments seven times.

617
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:13,548
- Comments? - Seven times.

618
00:24:13,548 --> 00:24:16,048
- You're scary. - Did she talk about others?

619
00:24:16,048 --> 00:24:18,308
- It's possible in 10 minutes. - What about pumpkin seeds?

620
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:20,078
She said Jae Seok and Seok Jin...

621
00:24:20,078 --> 00:24:22,008
are needy when they're on her team.

622
00:24:22,178 --> 00:24:23,978
- How could you say that? - She considers them old.

623
00:24:23,978 --> 00:24:25,008
- Gosh. - This is surprising.

624
00:24:25,008 --> 00:24:27,248
She said she's least comfortable with Haha.

625
00:24:27,248 --> 00:24:28,378
- Really? - Why?

626
00:24:28,378 --> 00:24:29,448
- So Min? - Why?

627
00:24:29,448 --> 00:24:31,108
- Didn't he buy you a meal? - She's like that.

628
00:24:31,108 --> 00:24:32,608
- What's wrong? - She's like that.

629
00:24:33,448 --> 00:24:35,648
- I don't understand Haha. - Why not?

630
00:24:35,648 --> 00:24:39,448
I'm the least close to him.

631
00:24:39,448 --> 00:24:41,148
(It was hard to approach Haha.)

632
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:44,008
- She's like that. - She thought he wasn't friendly.

633
00:24:44,008 --> 00:24:46,408
She thought he wasn't friendly.

634
00:24:46,578 --> 00:24:48,048
- So Min. - He isn't friendly.

635
00:24:48,048 --> 00:24:49,748
I didn't want her to get a wrong idea.

636
00:24:49,748 --> 00:24:52,078
- Gosh. - I didn't want to make her uneasy.

637
00:24:52,078 --> 00:24:53,708
She wouldn't feel uneasy.

638
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,008
- Don't misunderstand. - Okay.

639
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:56,608
I'll show you how friendly I am.

640
00:24:56,608 --> 00:24:57,978
(He'll be friendly.)

641
00:24:57,978 --> 00:24:59,848
So Min has the most points.

642
00:24:59,848 --> 00:25:03,378
Ji Hyo made six comments about others.

643
00:25:03,478 --> 00:25:05,448
- My goodness. - That's a lot.

644
00:25:05,448 --> 00:25:06,878
She agreed with others five times.

645
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,948
- I knew it. - With a total of 11, Ji Hyo wins.

646
00:25:09,948 --> 00:25:11,648
(Ji Hyo's team wins.)

647
00:25:11,908 --> 00:25:13,308
She's the best.

648
00:25:13,308 --> 00:25:14,848
She talks a lot about others.

649
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:15,978
No, I don't.

650
00:25:15,978 --> 00:25:18,108
- Do Yeon is nice. - It's because she's nice.

651
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:19,908
I didn't know this was the mission.

652
00:25:19,908 --> 00:25:22,208
- She could have done well. - I can make nasty comments.

653
00:25:22,808 --> 00:25:25,348
You're divided into teams now.

654
00:25:25,348 --> 00:25:27,448
We'll start the real competition.

655
00:25:27,448 --> 00:25:28,608
- Let's go. - Okay.

656
00:25:28,608 --> 00:25:30,608
(What's the next dangerous mission?)

657
00:25:30,608 --> 00:25:31,748
This is amazing.

658
00:25:31,848 --> 00:25:32,848
What's this?

659
00:25:33,178 --> 00:25:35,248
It's Running Marble.

660
00:25:35,348 --> 00:25:37,578
You put a lot of effort in the dresses.

661
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:38,648
It's that board game.

662
00:25:38,648 --> 00:25:39,708
(What is this about?)

663
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:41,178
I like the color of your t-shirt.

664
00:25:41,178 --> 00:25:42,578
- Really? - It's pink.

665
00:25:42,578 --> 00:25:44,078
My team's outfit looks depressing.

666
00:25:44,078 --> 00:25:46,208
- I asked for one in my size. - The outfit looks bad.

667
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:48,678
Goodness. Why didn't we get something in pink?

668
00:25:48,678 --> 00:25:51,408
Are you being biased towards us because we're old?

669
00:25:51,408 --> 00:25:53,178
(Is it because of our age?)

670
00:25:54,608 --> 00:25:56,808
- My goodness. - We're old?

671
00:25:56,908 --> 00:25:58,908
- What are you talking about? - It has nothing to do with it.

672
00:25:58,908 --> 00:26:00,648
You don't look good in clothes as an actress.

673
00:26:00,648 --> 00:26:01,648
(He counterattacks.)

674
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:02,948
- Seriously. - Listen.

675
00:26:03,248 --> 00:26:05,148
Let's just focus on work.

676
00:26:05,248 --> 00:26:06,448
Okay.

677
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:08,878
I'll make you do all the difficult tasks.

678
00:26:09,148 --> 00:26:11,748
The first team mission is called...

679
00:26:11,848 --> 00:26:13,408
Running Marble.

680
00:26:13,408 --> 00:26:15,148
- Do you know how to play it? - Yes.

681
00:26:15,578 --> 00:26:17,578
There's money in the back.

682
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:18,848
Each team gets 2,000 dollars.

683
00:26:18,848 --> 00:26:20,178
It's money.

684
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:21,348
- That's a lot. - Each gets 2,000 dollars?

685
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:22,648
It's like the board game.

686
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:24,108
The rules are simple.

687
00:26:24,108 --> 00:26:26,178
The winning team of Running Marble...

688
00:26:26,178 --> 00:26:27,878
will get a reward.

689
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,608
You may buy land after you finish one round.

690
00:26:30,878 --> 00:26:34,308
Only the female members can throw the dice.

691
00:26:34,308 --> 00:26:35,848
- Let's start with Do Yeon. - Okay.

692
00:26:35,848 --> 00:26:36,908
Please throw the dice.

693
00:26:37,148 --> 00:26:39,548
It's nice to get Golden Key from the start.

694
00:26:39,548 --> 00:26:40,578
Here I go.

695
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:41,808
It's quite heavy.

696
00:26:42,378 --> 00:26:44,948
(She throws the dice.)

697
00:26:44,948 --> 00:26:46,448
- It's really heavy. - Four.

698
00:26:46,778 --> 00:26:48,578
(It's 4.)

699
00:26:48,578 --> 00:26:50,378
- Let's see. - It's Jeju Island.

700
00:26:50,378 --> 00:26:51,608
- Okay. - Who's next?

701
00:26:52,648 --> 00:26:54,048
- There's no pressure. - Do you need help?

702
00:26:54,048 --> 00:26:55,948
(Ji Hyo throws the dice.)

703
00:26:56,408 --> 00:26:58,578
(Where will Ji Hyo's team land?)

704
00:26:58,578 --> 00:26:59,748
- It's 1. - It's 1.

705
00:27:00,178 --> 00:27:01,278
(They go to Taipei.)

706
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:03,708
- It's Taipei. - That's not bad, Ji Hyo.

707
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,778
- It's not very heavy. - It isn't?

708
00:27:05,778 --> 00:27:07,448
- Isn't it okay? - Throw it high.

709
00:27:08,948 --> 00:27:09,978
Throw it high.

710
00:27:09,978 --> 00:27:11,748
(Where will So Min's team land?)

711
00:27:11,748 --> 00:27:12,978
It's three.

712
00:27:12,978 --> 00:27:14,108
(They head to Osaka, Japan.)

713
00:27:14,108 --> 00:27:16,608
Everyone, you went around once.

714
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,608
- You didn't build any hotels yet. - Right.

715
00:27:19,608 --> 00:27:21,378
- What's this? - It's interesting.

716
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,548
This is Part Two of Global Project.

717
00:27:23,548 --> 00:27:25,478
The real mission is called...

718
00:27:26,148 --> 00:27:29,648
Dangerous Trips.

719
00:27:29,878 --> 00:27:31,708
- Pardon me? - Go to the city...

720
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:32,908
where you landed.

721
00:27:32,908 --> 00:27:34,678
- What? - You may go now.

722
00:27:34,678 --> 00:27:36,108
- What? - Do we have to go there?

723
00:27:36,478 --> 00:27:37,908
- You may go now. - What?

724
00:27:38,008 --> 00:27:39,148
Do we have to go there?

725
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,408
- It's a joke. - Really?

726
00:27:41,408 --> 00:27:42,708
No way.

727
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:45,278
- No way. - What are you talking about?

728
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:47,378
- Do we go to Jeju Island? - Do we go to Taipei?

729
00:27:47,378 --> 00:27:49,748
How can you say that with a straight face?

730
00:27:49,748 --> 00:27:51,248
I have a live recording tomorrow.

731
00:27:51,248 --> 00:27:53,008
- How can we go to Osaka now? - Do you mean that?

732
00:27:53,008 --> 00:27:54,808
I have a live recording tomorrow.

733
00:27:54,908 --> 00:27:56,908
The three teams will go to their city...

734
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:58,678
on a backpacking trip for one day.

735
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:00,608
Go and enjoy your trip.

736
00:28:00,608 --> 00:28:01,908
I can't believe it.

737
00:28:01,908 --> 00:28:03,978
- What about the other pieces? - I don't believe it.

738
00:28:04,048 --> 00:28:06,178
- How can we go to Osaka now? - We have to go to Osaka.

739
00:28:06,348 --> 00:28:07,408
One day in Osaka?

740
00:28:07,408 --> 00:28:09,478
That's why you asked us to bring passports.

741
00:28:09,478 --> 00:28:11,208
That's why you asked us to bring passports.

742
00:28:11,348 --> 00:28:13,548
Was it for this mission?

743
00:28:13,548 --> 00:28:14,708
- Is it a one-day trip? - My manager said...

744
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:17,478
I'll be starting a new show on MBC.

745
00:28:17,778 --> 00:28:20,748
I was happy to get more work, but it was about this.

746
00:28:20,808 --> 00:28:23,308
- Gosh. - Unbelievable.

747
00:28:23,308 --> 00:28:25,408
There are backpacks behind you.

748
00:28:25,408 --> 00:28:27,478
Each backpack has...

749
00:28:27,478 --> 00:28:30,448
a member's name in it.

750
00:28:31,048 --> 00:28:34,578
You have to get a souvenir...

751
00:28:34,578 --> 00:28:38,048
for the member whose name is in your backpack.

752
00:28:38,048 --> 00:28:39,048
A souvenir?

753
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:41,478
(A one-day trip...)

754
00:28:41,478 --> 00:28:43,408
(and souvenirs?)

755
00:28:43,408 --> 00:28:44,778
This is unbelievable.

756
00:28:44,778 --> 00:28:47,548
Please pick a backpack.

757
00:28:48,378 --> 00:28:49,578
- Okay. - Well...

758
00:28:49,648 --> 00:28:51,648
We won't have time to eat anything.

759
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:54,108
Your backpacks are important.

760
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:56,578
- So Min, please go ahead. - Pick a blue one.

761
00:28:57,908 --> 00:28:59,008
(She touches the props.)

762
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,378
I'll go with the members, right?

763
00:29:02,548 --> 00:29:05,248
(She destroys everything around her.)

764
00:29:06,008 --> 00:29:07,378
Look at this.

765
00:29:07,578 --> 00:29:09,578
I told you, right?

766
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:11,778
I'm so worried about you.

767
00:29:11,778 --> 00:29:14,108
- I thought you were bowling. - There's so much space.

768
00:29:14,108 --> 00:29:16,478
Exactly. How did she even touch them?

769
00:29:16,478 --> 00:29:18,308
- Did you see? - She's so clumsy.

770
00:29:18,308 --> 00:29:20,148
I'm so worried.

771
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:23,108
(Everyone has picked a backpack.)

772
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:27,108
Now, please leave for the country you chose.

773
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:29,578
We don't even have flight tickets.

774
00:29:29,578 --> 00:29:32,148
- When are we buying tickets? - As soon as the choices were made,

775
00:29:32,148 --> 00:29:35,678
we started booking flight tickets.

776
00:29:35,678 --> 00:29:37,208
- You're unbelievable. - That's amazing.

777
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,078
Give us our passports back.

778
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,978
- This is unbelievable. - Let's go.

779
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:42,778
- Let's go. - Let's go.

780
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:44,278
- See you. - See you.

781
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:47,178
(What will be waiting for them on this unexpected trip?)

782
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:52,878
(With everyone getting ready for departure, it's a chaos.)

783
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:54,748
(All they have is a backpack.)

784
00:29:54,748 --> 00:29:58,478
- Please give me a pair of socks. - Okay.

785
00:29:58,548 --> 00:30:01,278
I have to come back.

786
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:03,178
I have a shooting tomorrow.

787
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:05,678
Are we really leaving now?

788
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,878
Like this?

789
00:30:06,948 --> 00:30:09,078
Let's hurry.

790
00:30:09,078 --> 00:30:10,778
The flight is five hours long.

791
00:30:10,778 --> 00:30:13,678
(They get in the cars to head to the airport.)

792
00:30:14,448 --> 00:30:16,178
- We really are going to Osaka. - We are leaving.

793
00:30:16,178 --> 00:30:18,078
This is really happening.

794
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:20,778
We're going abroad from this early morning.

795
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:22,348
My goodness.

796
00:30:22,648 --> 00:30:24,178
I didn't know we'd go abroad.

797
00:30:24,308 --> 00:30:27,108
- I never imagined this. - This is so unexpected.

798
00:30:27,108 --> 00:30:29,078
- It's unbelievable. - It is.

799
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:32,048
- Seaweed soup with roe is amazing. - It's amazing.

800
00:30:32,048 --> 00:30:34,008
- I love roe. - It's fantastic.

801
00:30:34,008 --> 00:30:36,148
Grilled cutlassfish is good too.

802
00:30:36,148 --> 00:30:38,948
Jeju Island has great cutlassfish. We made a great choice.

803
00:30:40,008 --> 00:30:42,008
- We made the best choice. - We did.

804
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:44,048
Jeju Island is the best place in Korea.

805
00:30:44,048 --> 00:30:45,178
(Let's go to Jeju Island.)

806
00:30:47,408 --> 00:30:48,848
This is unbelievable.

807
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:50,408
Are we really going?

808
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:52,478
We really are at Incheon International Airport.

809
00:30:52,478 --> 00:30:53,778
(They arrive at Incheon International Airport.)

810
00:30:53,778 --> 00:30:55,648
- This is impossible. - Are we really going?

811
00:30:55,648 --> 00:30:57,978
(Everyone keeps asking, "Are we really going?")

812
00:30:59,048 --> 00:31:01,648
Are we really going to Osaka? Maybe we are.

813
00:31:01,648 --> 00:31:04,048
- We really are going. - Is it this way?

814
00:31:04,078 --> 00:31:06,478
- See you later. - See you.

815
00:31:06,478 --> 00:31:08,678
- Are you really going? - See you, Ji Hyo.

816
00:31:08,678 --> 00:31:10,678
- Maybe we really are going. - So Min, good luck.

817
00:31:10,678 --> 00:31:13,778
- Okay, see you. - You guys are not going, are you?

818
00:31:13,778 --> 00:31:16,278
Are you sure you're not going somewhere else?

819
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:17,708
Are we really going to Osaka?

820
00:31:17,748 --> 00:31:20,108
- This might be a prank. - We might not go.

821
00:31:20,448 --> 00:31:22,978
I have a live show tomorrow.

822
00:31:23,478 --> 00:31:25,548
- Even I... - We're coming back tonight.

823
00:31:25,548 --> 00:31:27,808
We must come back tonight.

824
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:31,148
(I'm sorry, but you guys really are going.)

825
00:31:32,648 --> 00:31:34,548
Guys, we don't know yet.

826
00:31:34,548 --> 00:31:36,648
We don't know until we're on the plane.

827
00:31:36,648 --> 00:31:39,308
Hey, it's over.

828
00:31:39,948 --> 00:31:43,348
- Se Chan, it's over. - I don't believe that.

829
00:31:45,148 --> 00:31:47,178
- Hello. - Hello.

830
00:31:47,178 --> 00:31:48,978
Are we really going to Japan?

831
00:31:48,978 --> 00:31:50,978
Yes, you're going to Osaka.

832
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:54,578
(There really are boarding passes for them.)

833
00:31:54,578 --> 00:31:55,748
Are they business-class seats?

834
00:31:55,778 --> 00:31:58,108
Yes, all three of them.

835
00:31:58,108 --> 00:32:00,278
- Why? - There were no economy-class seats.

836
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:02,208
Oh, my.

837
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:04,648
- We're lucky. - This is my first time.

838
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:07,308
They had to book the tickets this morning.

839
00:32:07,308 --> 00:32:09,678
- It was last minute. - Economy-class seats were sold out.

840
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:12,378
Were there only business-class seats? We're lucky.

841
00:32:12,378 --> 00:32:14,278
- This is my first time. - Really?

842
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:17,708
- Really? - I've never sat in business class.

843
00:32:18,378 --> 00:32:20,778
This is fun. What's different? Is the food different?

844
00:32:20,778 --> 00:32:22,178
Yes, the food is different.

845
00:32:22,448 --> 00:32:25,948
(Then...)

846
00:32:25,948 --> 00:32:27,208
Can I have some beer?

847
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:33,108
- We're shooting. - What are you talking about?

848
00:32:33,178 --> 00:32:36,648
I'm getting excited no matter what this is.

849
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:38,678
This is your itinerary.

850
00:32:38,678 --> 00:32:41,408
- We have 9 hours. - You're coming back tonight.

851
00:32:41,408 --> 00:32:44,648
Our return flight is at 5:50pm.

852
00:32:44,748 --> 00:32:48,278
Is this really possible?

853
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:50,378
- You visited Osaka last year. - Yes.

854
00:32:50,378 --> 00:32:52,878
Let's make an acrostic poem with Osaka.

855
00:32:52,878 --> 00:32:54,748
- "O". - On our trip,

856
00:32:54,748 --> 00:32:57,308
- "Sa". - I'll disappear.

857
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,678
(What?)

858
00:32:58,908 --> 00:32:59,978
Where's So Min?

859
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,278
(So Min goes missing in Osaka.)

860
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:05,578
(They shout So Min's name in the middle of Osaka.)

861
00:33:05,578 --> 00:33:07,478
(Criss-crossing Osaka)

862
00:33:07,478 --> 00:33:09,178
(Bouncing around)

863
00:33:09,478 --> 00:33:12,908
(You'll find out what happens in Osaka soon.)

864
00:33:14,108 --> 00:33:15,748
- "Ka". - It's the last one.

865
00:33:15,748 --> 00:33:18,178
(What about the last one?)

866
00:33:18,778 --> 00:33:20,178
- "Ka". - "Ka".

867
00:33:22,308 --> 00:33:24,278
(What is this?)

868
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:27,008
(What is with her?)

869
00:33:28,078 --> 00:33:29,078
Well...

870
00:33:29,078 --> 00:33:30,308
(He changes the subject quickly.)

871
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:31,308
What's wrong with that?

872
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,378
Let's go.

873
00:33:33,448 --> 00:33:34,608
(How will their trip go?)

874
00:33:35,678 --> 00:33:38,108
Once we go in there, it's over.

875
00:33:38,108 --> 00:33:40,948
- We can't come back here. - We already have boarding passes.

876
00:33:40,948 --> 00:33:43,278
They might cancel them later.

877
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:45,678
- We'll just go in. - We'll be back.

878
00:33:45,678 --> 00:33:47,948
- We can do this. - I'll be kicked out.

879
00:33:47,948 --> 00:33:49,378
(I'll be kicked out of "Comedy Big League" if I don't return.)

880
00:33:49,378 --> 00:33:50,878
He might be kicked out of his show if he doesn't come back in time.

881
00:33:50,878 --> 00:33:52,508
I'll be kicked out.

882
00:33:53,378 --> 00:33:55,308
Is this really happening?

883
00:33:55,308 --> 00:33:57,248
- Okay, this is it. - Are we going in?

884
00:33:57,578 --> 00:33:58,778
Let's go.

885
00:33:58,778 --> 00:34:00,308
- We don't have much time. - We don't.

886
00:34:00,308 --> 00:34:02,048
- We really are going. - We are.

887
00:34:02,048 --> 00:34:03,208
Are we really going?

888
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:05,308
This is incredible. We're such a global show.

889
00:34:05,308 --> 00:34:07,978
- We're global. - We really are.

890
00:34:10,478 --> 00:34:13,978
(The flight for Osaka departs.)

891
00:34:14,378 --> 00:34:15,848
I feel good.

892
00:34:15,848 --> 00:34:17,418
(It's always fun to go on a trip.)

893
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:19,008
- I'm feeling good. - Me too.

894
00:34:19,478 --> 00:34:21,178
(Crying)

895
00:34:21,178 --> 00:34:22,278
(It reminds her of something.)

896
00:34:22,678 --> 00:34:24,378
I used to cry a lot when I was a baby.

897
00:34:24,378 --> 00:34:25,578
My mom said...

898
00:34:25,578 --> 00:34:27,108
(Why are you suddenly talking about it?)

899
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,808
I cried even at a honking car.

900
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:33,108
(Talking)

901
00:34:33,108 --> 00:34:34,848
(It never ends.)

902
00:34:34,848 --> 00:34:36,978
So Min sure...

903
00:34:37,548 --> 00:34:39,278
loves to talk.

904
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:40,478
You never stop.

905
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,478
You have too many stories to tell.

906
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:47,878
(They fly over the sea with fluttering hearts.)

907
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:49,948
(The talkative girl has fallen asleep.)

908
00:34:50,108 --> 00:34:52,178
(Sleep is better than beer.)

909
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:55,848
(Shaking)

910
00:34:57,548 --> 00:35:01,148
(They arrive at Kansai International Airport at 11:20am.)

911
00:35:01,578 --> 00:35:02,948
Ladies and gentlemen...

912
00:35:02,948 --> 00:35:05,248
- We're here. - We're in Japan.

913
00:35:05,248 --> 00:35:07,078
We really are in Japan.

914
00:35:07,748 --> 00:35:09,748
- We're in Japan. - It's quite chilly.

915
00:35:09,778 --> 00:35:11,348
It's chilly.

916
00:35:11,748 --> 00:35:13,748
It's a lot colder here than in Korea.

917
00:35:13,748 --> 00:35:15,008
It's colder here.

918
00:35:15,008 --> 00:35:17,148
You should protect your bones from the cold wind.

919
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,148
We're not that old.

920
00:35:19,148 --> 00:35:22,348
- So Min. - It's quite chilly.

921
00:35:23,978 --> 00:35:25,478
(Their trip in Japan starts.)

922
00:35:25,478 --> 00:35:27,208
Where are we going now?

923
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,548
Where are we going?

924
00:35:28,548 --> 00:35:31,048
- We're in Taiwan. - We are.

925
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:33,278
- Is this Taiwan? - We're not in Incheon.

926
00:35:33,278 --> 00:35:34,878
(It feels like they're just in another city in Korea.)

927
00:35:35,778 --> 00:35:37,648
- It's hot. - It's so hot.

928
00:35:37,648 --> 00:35:41,248
Do you think Taiwan is Daejeon?

929
00:35:41,278 --> 00:35:42,678
Welcome to Taiwan.

930
00:35:42,678 --> 00:35:45,548
- Why did you make us come here? - Gosh.

931
00:35:46,848 --> 00:35:49,948
- We're in Jeju Island. - Welcome to Jeju Island.

932
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:52,178
It feels so exotic.

933
00:35:53,148 --> 00:35:56,008
Only one option was in Korea, and Do Yeon chose it.

934
00:35:56,978 --> 00:35:59,278
- Right? - I'm a patriot.

935
00:35:59,578 --> 00:36:01,378
- You really are. - She's a daughter of Korea.

936
00:36:01,378 --> 00:36:04,148
Of course. This is the best place in Korea.

937
00:36:04,148 --> 00:36:06,308
I'm so happy.

938
00:36:06,948 --> 00:36:08,948
- You're in Osaka now. - Yes.

939
00:36:08,948 --> 00:36:12,308
As I said, you'll look around the city...

940
00:36:12,308 --> 00:36:14,278
and get souvenirs for the members whose names are in your bags.

941
00:36:14,378 --> 00:36:16,048
- Souvenirs. - Okay.

942
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:19,048
It would be nice if that was all you have to do.

943
00:36:19,048 --> 00:36:21,108
- Go on. - I'm sure there's something more.

944
00:36:21,108 --> 00:36:23,478
- There's a mission for you. - What is it?

945
00:36:23,478 --> 00:36:25,678
You have to complete a mission here in Taiwan.

946
00:36:25,678 --> 00:36:27,778
You have to complete a mission here in Jeju Island.

947
00:36:27,778 --> 00:36:29,178
- What is it? - A mission?

948
00:36:29,178 --> 00:36:33,208
If you fail to complete the mission or go back to Korea today,

949
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:34,678
you'll get a Tour Sticker.

950
00:36:34,678 --> 00:36:36,248
Tour Sticker is on the line again.

951
00:36:36,248 --> 00:36:37,948
(They'll be given a Tour Sticker if they fail.)

952
00:36:37,948 --> 00:36:40,278
(The one who accumulates 3 Tour Stickers...)

953
00:36:40,278 --> 00:36:43,478
(will be sent to a dangerous tourist attraction.)

954
00:36:43,478 --> 00:36:45,478
We're at a disadvantage.

955
00:36:45,478 --> 00:36:49,148
Let's just avoid getting Tour Stickers.

956
00:36:49,148 --> 00:36:50,278
- Okay. - Okay.

957
00:36:50,378 --> 00:36:51,548
(Why are you telling us now?)

958
00:36:51,548 --> 00:36:53,178
Let's go.

959
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:56,108
Here is today's mission.

960
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:57,248
What is it?

961
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,418
- "Costume play"? - What?

962
00:36:59,478 --> 00:37:01,608
I saw "costume play" written on it.

963
00:37:02,278 --> 00:37:04,278
- "Hair salon"? - What are those?

964
00:37:04,278 --> 00:37:05,478
(What's that?)

965
00:37:05,478 --> 00:37:07,578
- What's that? - "Getting a hairstyle..."

966
00:37:07,578 --> 00:37:09,008
(Getting a hairstyle that is trendy here)

967
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:11,278
My goodness.

968
00:37:11,278 --> 00:37:13,178
What do you think you're doing?

969
00:37:13,478 --> 00:37:16,148
- Are we to pick one? - "Bathhouse"?

970
00:37:17,448 --> 00:37:20,148
- Are we picking one? - Wait. "Visiting a bathhouse..."

971
00:37:20,148 --> 00:37:23,178
"run by an owner whose last name is Suzuki"?

972
00:37:23,678 --> 00:37:26,948
- What is this... - There are three options.

973
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:31,548
Visiting a bathhouse, taking a picture with costume players,

974
00:37:31,548 --> 00:37:35,178
or getting a hairstyle that is trendy here.

975
00:37:35,178 --> 00:37:36,948
My goodness.

976
00:37:36,948 --> 00:37:39,178
So Min will throw her shoe.

977
00:37:39,178 --> 00:37:41,418
- Me? - So Min has to do it.

978
00:37:41,418 --> 00:37:44,378
- So Min, do a good job. - Do a good job.

979
00:37:44,378 --> 00:37:46,378
Which one do you want?

980
00:37:46,378 --> 00:37:47,748
Taking a picture with costume players seems best.

981
00:37:47,748 --> 00:37:49,278
I'll aim for it then.

982
00:37:49,278 --> 00:37:52,048
- Don't pick the hairstyle one. - Don't pick that one.

983
00:37:52,048 --> 00:37:55,008
- That's the worst. - I didn't bring my hair powder.

984
00:37:55,178 --> 00:37:57,078
- Hey. - Hey.

985
00:37:57,078 --> 00:37:58,678
(She threw her shoe all of a sudden.)

986
00:37:58,678 --> 00:38:00,008
Be more careful.

987
00:38:00,008 --> 00:38:01,308
(She started without any notice.)

988
00:38:01,308 --> 00:38:02,378
Visiting a bathhouse is not that nice either.

989
00:38:02,378 --> 00:38:03,378
(Screaming)

990
00:38:03,378 --> 00:38:06,308
- Don't aim for anything. - What did you do?

991
00:38:06,308 --> 00:38:09,278
I aimed for the costume play one.

992
00:38:09,278 --> 00:38:10,678
Costume play.

993
00:38:10,678 --> 00:38:13,278
- Don't aim for anything. - My gosh.

994
00:38:13,278 --> 00:38:15,878
(Will you please listen to us?)

995
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:18,478
- I said not to aim for anything. - Goodness.

996
00:38:18,948 --> 00:38:20,808
- Tell us before you start. - Okay.

997
00:38:20,808 --> 00:38:22,378
Let's start. Start!

998
00:38:22,378 --> 00:38:23,748
(They can't even start their mission.)

999
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:26,418
- You can't even succeed in this? - So Min.

1000
00:38:26,778 --> 00:38:28,278
Just land it on the paper.

1001
00:38:28,278 --> 00:38:30,378
It doesn't matter which mission we do.

1002
00:38:30,378 --> 00:38:32,208
- She's a terrible new member. - Gosh.

1003
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:34,248
Hey.

1004
00:38:34,248 --> 00:38:35,918
You are driving me crazy.

1005
00:38:35,978 --> 00:38:37,448
You can't land it there?

1006
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:40,048
- So Min. - Can't you just kick it there?

1007
00:38:41,378 --> 00:38:42,848
- Try to do better. - Try it.

1008
00:38:42,848 --> 00:38:44,748
(There's no more time to waste.)

1009
00:38:45,978 --> 00:38:51,378
(She must gently place the shoe on it while her foot merely helps.)

1010
00:38:51,378 --> 00:38:54,048
(Will they be able to start their mission?)

1011
00:38:54,278 --> 00:38:57,708
"Take a bath at the bathhouse run by a Suzuki."

1012
00:38:58,778 --> 00:38:59,878
A bath?

1013
00:39:00,178 --> 00:39:01,308
All right.

1014
00:39:01,378 --> 00:39:05,308
The most common last name in Japan is "Sato".

1015
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:07,448
The second most common last name is "Suzuki".

1016
00:39:07,448 --> 00:39:09,308
So you didn't book one already?

1017
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:10,748
- You didn't? - We didn't.

1018
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,478
We have to find a bathhouse owned by a Suzuki?

1019
00:39:12,478 --> 00:39:15,108
(On a one-day trip, we will go to a Suzuki's bathhouse?)

1020
00:39:15,248 --> 00:39:16,278
So we have to find it.

1021
00:39:16,308 --> 00:39:18,678
The bathhouse must be owned by a Suzuki.

1022
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:21,448
- The owner must have... - The last name must be Suzuki.

1023
00:39:21,448 --> 00:39:22,648
I got it.

1024
00:39:22,648 --> 00:39:25,448
We will get going to start your mission.

1025
00:39:25,448 --> 00:39:26,508
- Yes! - Immediately?

1026
00:39:26,508 --> 00:39:29,078
- Yes? We have to find the place. - Let's go.

1027
00:39:29,108 --> 00:39:30,578
My goodness.

1028
00:39:30,778 --> 00:39:32,378
Are there a lot of bathhouses?

1029
00:39:33,078 --> 00:39:34,418
- You will know when you get there. - I don't think so.

1030
00:39:34,418 --> 00:39:35,548
- What? - We will know once we are there.

1031
00:39:35,548 --> 00:39:37,208
- You will know once we are there? - Yes.

1032
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:40,148
They didn't reserve a place in advance.

1033
00:39:40,148 --> 00:39:42,148
(They are busy.)

1034
00:39:42,578 --> 00:39:44,478
- They should have... - Hey, help us remove them.

1035
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,508
You ought to help us get rid of them.

1036
00:39:46,878 --> 00:39:48,778
- It's only us here. - Someone will remove them.

1037
00:39:48,778 --> 00:39:50,308
I guess it's hard to remove them.

1038
00:39:50,648 --> 00:39:52,208
Why is it so hard to detach this?

1039
00:39:52,778 --> 00:39:54,608
- Remove this. - Is it that hard?

1040
00:39:54,608 --> 00:39:55,648
Yes.

1041
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,918
- Let me try. - I already finished.

1042
00:40:02,778 --> 00:40:05,748
By the way, this mission sounds really challenging.

1043
00:40:06,078 --> 00:40:07,178
First of all...

1044
00:40:07,178 --> 00:40:09,678
- We have to find Mr. or Ms. Suzuki. - We can't even speak Japanese.

1045
00:40:09,678 --> 00:40:13,008
- How can we find a bathhouse? - Let's use a translating program.

1046
00:40:13,008 --> 00:40:14,148
- What? - A translating program?

1047
00:40:14,148 --> 00:40:16,078
- Suzuki. - A translating program.

1048
00:40:18,278 --> 00:40:19,748
What are the other teams doing?

1049
00:40:19,748 --> 00:40:21,078
What do we do?

1050
00:40:21,078 --> 00:40:23,418
The mission is about food. This is amazing.

1051
00:40:23,608 --> 00:40:25,578
This is the best.

1052
00:40:25,678 --> 00:40:27,348
The rule is very simple.

1053
00:40:27,578 --> 00:40:30,308
Three of you will kick your shoes.

1054
00:40:31,278 --> 00:40:35,948
You finish the mission when you eat all the food your shoe chose.

1055
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:38,878
- Look. We have to eat beef noodles. - We must eat beef noodles.

1056
00:40:38,878 --> 00:40:40,608
- Look at that. It's tasty too. - Danzai noodles?

1057
00:40:40,608 --> 00:40:41,678
Are those noodles?

1058
00:40:41,678 --> 00:40:43,148
- It is. - Those noodles are tasty.

1059
00:40:43,148 --> 00:40:44,478
- Hot pot. - We must have the hot pot!

1060
00:40:44,478 --> 00:40:47,148
- Hot pot! - Hot pot!

1061
00:40:47,148 --> 00:40:49,208
We should buy pineapple cakes. There's xiaolongbao. Look.

1062
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:51,208
- Stinky tofu dish? - Will it...

1063
00:40:51,578 --> 00:40:54,548
- I can't eat stinky tofu dish. - We can't eat that.

1064
00:40:54,548 --> 00:40:55,678
I can't eat that.

1065
00:40:55,678 --> 00:40:56,848
Let's avoid that.

1066
00:40:56,848 --> 00:41:01,648
If your shoe falls on more than one dish, you must eat all the dishes.

1067
00:41:02,808 --> 00:41:05,848
Eating is not a problem, but can we finish on time?

1068
00:41:05,848 --> 00:41:07,608
- What time is our flight? - We have to eat them in time.

1069
00:41:07,608 --> 00:41:10,108
We might get the stinky tofu dish if we try to get the hot pot.

1070
00:41:10,108 --> 00:41:11,648
- Okay. I'll aim for beef noodles. - Aim for beef noodles.

1071
00:41:11,748 --> 00:41:13,808
- Kick gently. Gently. - She's right.

1072
00:41:14,448 --> 00:41:16,248
- Gently. - Please.

1073
00:41:16,248 --> 00:41:18,978
(Will his shoe make their wish come true?)

1074
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:26,448
(Please don't let it be the stinky tofu dish.)

1075
00:41:27,278 --> 00:41:29,008
Haha, it fell short. Don't! Goodness.

1076
00:41:29,418 --> 00:41:31,678
(It's a betrayal of his shoe.)

1077
00:41:31,678 --> 00:41:33,178
- Don't! Goodness, Haha. - Hold on.

1078
00:41:33,178 --> 00:41:35,708
(They'll taste the stinky tofu dish which they've been wishing for.)

1079
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:37,918
Your shoe chose the stinky tofu dish and mango shaved ice.

1080
00:41:37,918 --> 00:41:39,448
Haha, you kicked in that direction on purpose, right?

1081
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:42,578
Next member, please get ready.

1082
00:41:42,578 --> 00:41:44,378
- Ji Hyo. Let me try. - Okay.

1083
00:41:44,748 --> 00:41:46,578
Haha, we ought to eat beef noodles.

1084
00:41:46,578 --> 00:41:47,848
(Let's eat beef noodles.)

1085
00:41:47,848 --> 00:41:49,708
We really should at least eat beef noodles.

1086
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:52,178
Move a bit more. Just a little bit more.

1087
00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:56,508
(On which dish will his shoe fall?)

1088
00:41:57,808 --> 00:42:00,048
- Hey, that's great. - This is great.

1089
00:42:00,048 --> 00:42:02,078
- It's on the line. - No.

1090
00:42:02,178 --> 00:42:04,418
- It's on the line for beef noodles? - Is it on the line?

1091
00:42:04,418 --> 00:42:05,648
Look. The beef noodles...

1092
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,748
(Pushing)

1093
00:42:07,748 --> 00:42:10,248
(I really want to taste beef noodles.)

1094
00:42:10,248 --> 00:42:11,778
(Did they forget about Tour Stickers?)

1095
00:42:11,778 --> 00:42:12,918
Beef noodles...

1096
00:42:13,418 --> 00:42:14,548
We will let you have the beef noodles.

1097
00:42:14,548 --> 00:42:16,078
(They add the beef noodles on the list!)

1098
00:42:16,078 --> 00:42:17,418
Ji Hyo. You are the last one.

1099
00:42:18,108 --> 00:42:19,708
- Let's have the hot pot. - Hot pot!

1100
00:42:20,048 --> 00:42:21,178
- Shall we? - Or the pineapple cakes.

1101
00:42:21,418 --> 00:42:22,808
Xiaolongbao isn't a bad choice too.

1102
00:42:24,978 --> 00:42:26,178
- Gosh! - Pineapple cakes!

1103
00:42:28,348 --> 00:42:29,578
(Pineapple cakes and danzai noodles are selected!)

1104
00:42:30,278 --> 00:42:32,748
- We have 5 dishes to eat. - 5 dishes.

1105
00:42:32,748 --> 00:42:35,578
- I should have gotten the hot pot. - You got those two dishes.

1106
00:42:35,578 --> 00:42:37,348
- We have to eat quickly and go. - Right. Let's go.

1107
00:42:37,348 --> 00:42:38,748
We really should hurry.

1108
00:42:38,748 --> 00:42:40,278
- Let's go. - Let's go!

1109
00:42:40,278 --> 00:42:43,278
To taste the stinky tofu dish, come to Taiwan!

1110
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:46,378
We should eat the stinky tofu dish and mango shaved ice, right?

1111
00:42:46,808 --> 00:42:48,278
Right. We have to eat something sweet after that.

1112
00:42:48,508 --> 00:42:50,278
Shall we start with danzai noodles?

1113
00:42:50,278 --> 00:42:52,418
- Let's start with danzai noodles. - Great.

1114
00:42:52,418 --> 00:42:54,748
- This kind of trip isn't easy. - You're right.

1115
00:42:54,748 --> 00:42:55,918
- We have to make time for trips. - Right.

1116
00:42:55,918 --> 00:42:57,918
- We have to make time for trips. - We are here to have lunch.

1117
00:42:57,918 --> 00:43:00,008
You know what? Other teams...

1118
00:43:00,008 --> 00:43:01,478
Should we do this? It's been a while.

1119
00:43:02,008 --> 00:43:04,948
- What are other teams doing? - What are other teams doing?

1120
00:43:07,508 --> 00:43:09,208
(Jeju Island, foreign land in Korea)

1121
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:11,278
- What are we going to do? - Let's go with ramyeon.

1122
00:43:11,778 --> 00:43:13,178
Don't pick women divers.

1123
00:43:13,178 --> 00:43:18,178
(On a lucky day, what will the shoe choose?)

1124
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,078
(Will it choose oranges from Jeju?)

1125
00:43:20,078 --> 00:43:23,078
(Will it choose sightseeing a view that UNESCO acknowledged?)

1126
00:43:24,078 --> 00:43:28,308
(Please let today be a happy day.)

1127
00:43:29,808 --> 00:43:31,508
(Sea?)

1128
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:35,248
(Will they have to dive into the water?)

1129
00:43:35,248 --> 00:43:37,208
(They all freeze.)

1130
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:38,548
Your shoe chose the sea.

1131
00:43:38,548 --> 00:43:40,208
Wasn't UNESCO a good choice too?

1132
00:43:40,378 --> 00:43:42,848
I will explain the mission for the sea.

1133
00:43:43,048 --> 00:43:44,608
The mission for the sea is that...

1134
00:43:45,148 --> 00:43:48,278
you have to wear a diving suit and dive into the sea with women divers.

1135
00:43:48,278 --> 00:43:50,808
You must catch an octopus with your own hands and make ramyeon with it.

1136
00:43:51,508 --> 00:43:53,408
(Sea? Women divers?)

1137
00:43:55,348 --> 00:44:01,848
(Catch an octopus with women divers in the blue sea of Jeju Island.)

1138
00:44:02,108 --> 00:44:03,408
We have to catch an octopus?

1139
00:44:03,978 --> 00:44:06,308
We have to dive into the water and get an octopus, right?

1140
00:44:06,308 --> 00:44:08,008
- Right. - What was the mission for UNESCO?

1141
00:44:08,108 --> 00:44:10,648
Women divers are registered as Intangible Cultural Heritage...

1142
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,078
of Humanity. You will wear the diving suit with them and...

1143
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:15,648
(Welcome)

1144
00:44:17,278 --> 00:44:19,048
He's a con artist!

1145
00:44:19,108 --> 00:44:21,178
When did Running Man degenerate?

1146
00:44:21,478 --> 00:44:23,478
I thought this was a just program.

1147
00:44:23,478 --> 00:44:24,478
(The truth of their mission board is revealed.)

1148
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,448
The mission about the activity is...

1149
00:44:26,678 --> 00:44:28,248
It's the most famous activity in Jeju Island.

1150
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:31,348
Through the activity of women divers, you will catch an octopus.

1151
00:44:31,448 --> 00:44:36,408
(Welcome. You won't be able to escape from this trap.)

1152
00:44:37,178 --> 00:44:38,278
What a jerk!

1153
00:44:38,278 --> 00:44:39,508
(They must cook octopus ramyeon.)

1154
00:44:39,508 --> 00:44:42,248
(They set out to experience women divers' job.)

1155
00:44:43,178 --> 00:44:46,878
(Which team will receive a Tour Sticker?)

1156
00:44:58,127 --> 00:45:02,097
(Their mission is to visit a bathhouse run by Mr. or Ms. Suzuki.)

1157
00:45:02,857 --> 00:45:05,297
Since Suzuki is the second most common last name,

1158
00:45:05,297 --> 00:45:07,697
it's like Lee if I were to compare it to a Korean last name.

1159
00:45:08,357 --> 00:45:11,827
Hey, I'm not just saying this. This is really absurd.

1160
00:45:12,297 --> 00:45:15,727
- What are we doing here? - Why do we have to find it?

1161
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:18,157
We have to find a bathhouse run by Mr. or Ms. Suzuki. Goodness.

1162
00:45:18,157 --> 00:45:21,797
- We can't call... - By the way, our flight is at 6pm.

1163
00:45:21,797 --> 00:45:22,897
It's around 5pm.

1164
00:45:23,227 --> 00:45:25,627
- We have to be back by 4pm. - We have two hours.

1165
00:45:25,627 --> 00:45:27,657
- We don't have much time left. - I told you. We do not.

1166
00:45:27,657 --> 00:45:29,727
- We have to buy presents too. - This is...

1167
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,427
We are in trouble.

1168
00:45:31,427 --> 00:45:32,857
What is bathhouse in Japanese?

1169
00:45:32,857 --> 00:45:34,697
- I will let you know. - What is it?

1170
00:45:35,157 --> 00:45:36,597
- First of all, we should... - "Sento".

1171
00:45:36,597 --> 00:45:38,227
- "Sento". - "Sento"?

1172
00:45:38,227 --> 00:45:39,457
("Sento" means a bathhouse.)

1173
00:45:39,457 --> 00:45:41,727
- We should know it before we go. - "Sento".

1174
00:45:41,727 --> 00:45:42,997
Suzuki's "sento".

1175
00:45:43,397 --> 00:45:44,897
What happens if we can't find one?

1176
00:45:44,927 --> 00:45:46,297
(Their destination is Suzuki's bathhouse.)

1177
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:48,427
- "Sento". - "Sento".

1178
00:45:48,427 --> 00:45:49,757
"Suzuki's bathhouse".

1179
00:45:49,757 --> 00:45:51,027
Was it "sento"?

1180
00:45:51,027 --> 00:45:52,157
- Yes. - Yes.

1181
00:45:52,157 --> 00:45:54,557
"Suzuki's..."

1182
00:45:54,727 --> 00:45:57,497
"Suzuki's bathhouse".

1183
00:45:57,757 --> 00:46:00,057
- You need to sound cheeky. - "Sento".

1184
00:46:00,627 --> 00:46:02,497
- "Suzuki's bathhouse". - What do you mean, cheeky?

1185
00:46:02,797 --> 00:46:05,157
(You are cheeky for saying that.)

1186
00:46:05,797 --> 00:46:07,127
Doesn't it sound a bit manly?

1187
00:46:07,127 --> 00:46:09,257
"Suzuki's bathhouse". You have to sound nice.

1188
00:46:09,257 --> 00:46:11,457
- You sounded like a girl. - No, I was being kind.

1189
00:46:11,797 --> 00:46:12,827
(He sounds like an angry father.)

1190
00:46:12,827 --> 00:46:13,927
What was that?

1191
00:46:13,927 --> 00:46:16,497
Shouldn't we say, "Are you Suzuki?"

1192
00:46:16,497 --> 00:46:17,697
"Are you Suzuki?"

1193
00:46:17,997 --> 00:46:19,727
Isn't it asking if something is a bathhouse?

1194
00:46:19,727 --> 00:46:21,557
No, it isn't.

1195
00:46:22,457 --> 00:46:25,297
Now that I speak decent English, I can't speak Japanese.

1196
00:46:25,457 --> 00:46:27,127
What do you mean you can speak English?

1197
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,697
- Goodness. You're frustrating me. - There you go again.

1198
00:46:29,697 --> 00:46:31,327
- Fine. - Lower your knees.

1199
00:46:31,327 --> 00:46:33,427
- To where? Here? - Hey. Look.

1200
00:46:33,427 --> 00:46:36,297
- You're blocking the shot. - Where would I put my feet?

1201
00:46:36,297 --> 00:46:38,227
I have to split my legs like this then.

1202
00:46:38,227 --> 00:46:40,097
- Look at the frame. - Aren't you being too mean?

1203
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:42,327
- That camera is filming you two. - Seriously.

1204
00:46:42,327 --> 00:46:44,057
- The camera is filming only her. - You don't have to...

1205
00:46:44,057 --> 00:46:45,957
Only this camera is filming me.

1206
00:46:45,957 --> 00:46:47,697
Your knees are blocking the shot.

1207
00:46:47,697 --> 00:46:49,857
- Hey, lower them. - Let go of them.

1208
00:46:49,957 --> 00:46:51,827
Other cameras are filming you guys, but not me.

1209
00:46:51,827 --> 00:46:52,927
- This one is filming you. - Hey.

1210
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,297
- Let go of my leg. - Move your legs.

1211
00:46:55,497 --> 00:46:57,997
- It's the only camera filming me. - Let go of me.

1212
00:47:03,597 --> 00:47:05,527
(Surprised)

1213
00:47:05,897 --> 00:47:07,057
What happened?

1214
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:09,697
The camera is so up close.

1215
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:11,797
(It's as if she found a hidden camera.)

1216
00:47:11,797 --> 00:47:13,657
That was sudden. You've been sitting like this.

1217
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,227
Just because you act surprised...

1218
00:47:16,357 --> 00:47:18,197
What are you doing, So Min?

1219
00:47:18,197 --> 00:47:20,227
- Just stay still. - Stay as you are.

1220
00:47:20,227 --> 00:47:22,827
- She's such an odd girl. - She is.

1221
00:47:23,127 --> 00:47:24,497
Nothing changes because you act surprised.

1222
00:47:24,727 --> 00:47:26,757
- Will that change anything? - Will it?

1223
00:47:27,157 --> 00:47:29,357
- She's so weird. - She's strange.

1224
00:47:29,357 --> 00:47:30,497
What are you looking at?

1225
00:47:30,497 --> 00:47:32,297
- What are you doing? - What's wrong?

1226
00:47:32,427 --> 00:47:34,327
- You shouldn't avoid your camera. - Sit back.

1227
00:47:34,327 --> 00:47:35,697
I feel suddenly...

1228
00:47:35,697 --> 00:47:36,857
(Can I borrow your shoulder for a moment?)

1229
00:47:36,857 --> 00:47:38,627
What are you doing?

1230
00:47:39,027 --> 00:47:41,727
- So Min is so weird. - She's so weird.

1231
00:47:41,727 --> 00:47:43,657
She's really weird.

1232
00:47:44,327 --> 00:47:45,797
- My goodness. - Gosh.

1233
00:47:45,797 --> 00:47:46,827
(She covers the camera with her hand.)

1234
00:47:46,827 --> 00:47:47,897
What are you doing?

1235
00:47:47,897 --> 00:47:49,297
Give me that camera.

1236
00:47:49,297 --> 00:47:50,957
Stop it.

1237
00:47:50,997 --> 00:47:51,997
My goodness.

1238
00:47:51,997 --> 00:47:54,827
Will we be able to find a bathhouse run by Suzuki?

1239
00:47:54,957 --> 00:47:57,127
We'll go to Dotonbori...

1240
00:47:57,227 --> 00:47:58,727
and have lunch.

1241
00:47:58,727 --> 00:48:01,697
And then we'll take a bath at a bathhouse run by Suzuki.

1242
00:48:01,697 --> 00:48:02,997
- Okay. - That's our plan.

1243
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,297
Good.

1244
00:48:04,857 --> 00:48:07,057
(Osaka, Japan's second largest city, is famous for...)

1245
00:48:07,057 --> 00:48:11,127
(its historical sites and food.)

1246
00:48:12,327 --> 00:48:14,597
- It'll be so tasty. - I'm hungry.

1247
00:48:14,597 --> 00:48:16,557
I didn't eat anything on the plane.

1248
00:48:16,557 --> 00:48:17,557
Are we there yet?

1249
00:48:19,957 --> 00:48:21,857
- What are you doing? - I spoke Korean unconsciously.

1250
00:48:22,557 --> 00:48:23,697
I think we're here.

1251
00:48:24,057 --> 00:48:25,097
Should we get out?

1252
00:48:25,097 --> 00:48:26,457
(Are we really in Osaka?)

1253
00:48:27,827 --> 00:48:29,797
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1254
00:48:29,797 --> 00:48:31,257
Thank you.

1255
00:48:31,457 --> 00:48:34,227
Thank you.

1256
00:48:36,427 --> 00:48:37,927
We're in Japan.

1257
00:48:37,927 --> 00:48:39,297
(We really are in Osaka.)

1258
00:48:39,297 --> 00:48:40,357
We're in Japan.

1259
00:48:40,357 --> 00:48:41,697
Gosh, we're in Japan.

1260
00:48:42,997 --> 00:48:44,357
(Colorful signs welcome them.)

1261
00:48:44,357 --> 00:48:45,827
That sign is so pretty.

1262
00:48:45,927 --> 00:48:46,927
It's so cute.

1263
00:48:47,397 --> 00:48:48,897
(Delicious Japanese food)

1264
00:48:48,897 --> 00:48:49,997
This is nice.

1265
00:48:49,997 --> 00:48:50,997
This is really nice.

1266
00:48:50,997 --> 00:48:52,857
We came here unexpectedly,

1267
00:48:52,857 --> 00:48:54,327
- and it's nice. - This is nice.

1268
00:48:54,327 --> 00:48:55,797
It's nice to be here so unexpectedly.

1269
00:48:55,797 --> 00:48:57,257
(It's even nicer because it's unexpected.)

1270
00:48:57,257 --> 00:48:58,797
I feel so good.

1271
00:48:58,927 --> 00:49:00,597
- Where are we now? - The sign...

1272
00:49:00,597 --> 00:49:01,927
We're in Dotonbori. Look at that.

1273
00:49:02,597 --> 00:49:04,557
- Oh, that. - You know that, right?

1274
00:49:04,557 --> 00:49:06,357
- Are we in Dotonbori? - Yes.

1275
00:49:06,357 --> 00:49:07,527
This is nice.

1276
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:08,527
Now I understand...

1277
00:49:08,527 --> 00:49:11,097
- what you meant by Cheonggyecheon. - It's right here.

1278
00:49:12,027 --> 00:49:13,697
I smell food.

1279
00:49:13,697 --> 00:49:15,427
Okonomiyaki...

1280
00:49:15,427 --> 00:49:16,957
- Let's go. - We're going to play a game.

1281
00:49:17,127 --> 00:49:18,557
The loser will treat the whole staff.

1282
00:49:19,097 --> 00:49:20,657
(Ouch)

1283
00:49:21,657 --> 00:49:24,097
(The pole was there the whole time.)

1284
00:49:24,097 --> 00:49:26,627
(He bumped into it.)

1285
00:49:28,197 --> 00:49:29,997
"The loser will treat the whole staff."

1286
00:49:29,997 --> 00:49:31,597
(Seok Jin was too excited.)

1287
00:49:32,327 --> 00:49:33,457
- Seok Jin. - Gosh.

1288
00:49:33,457 --> 00:49:36,097
- What did you do? - I'm okay.

1289
00:49:36,427 --> 00:49:38,257
You can get on a boat here too.

1290
00:49:38,257 --> 00:49:39,997
We should try.

1291
00:49:39,997 --> 00:49:42,127
We should try, but we don't have time.

1292
00:49:42,127 --> 00:49:43,557
We have to... Gosh.

1293
00:49:43,557 --> 00:49:45,697
We have to leave here around 3pm at the latest.

1294
00:49:45,697 --> 00:49:48,597
Hey, we're not shooting a travel show.

1295
00:49:48,597 --> 00:49:49,957
What is she doing?

1296
00:49:51,357 --> 00:49:53,397
I wish we could get on a boat.

1297
00:49:53,627 --> 00:49:54,957
My goodness.

1298
00:49:54,957 --> 00:49:56,427
- What is she doing? - What are you doing?

1299
00:49:56,427 --> 00:49:57,497
Like I said,

1300
00:49:57,497 --> 00:50:00,027
I'm going to write a report on her within two weeks.

1301
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:02,197
She's...

1302
00:50:02,427 --> 00:50:03,757
on the verge now.

1303
00:50:04,197 --> 00:50:05,797
So far, she's been just a little odd.

1304
00:50:06,197 --> 00:50:08,297
- She's been a little odd. - She's really odd.

1305
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:09,397
She's odd.

1306
00:50:10,357 --> 00:50:12,797
(So Min is going to turn Osaka upside down today.)

1307
00:50:12,797 --> 00:50:14,297
There are so many people.

1308
00:50:15,197 --> 00:50:16,997
Goodness. What should we do?

1309
00:50:17,757 --> 00:50:19,557
(Meanwhile...)

1310
00:50:20,457 --> 00:50:22,297
(Next to the weird girl...)

1311
00:50:22,297 --> 00:50:24,097
(is an overly excited middle-aged man.)

1312
00:50:24,097 --> 00:50:25,127
This is nice.

1313
00:50:25,997 --> 00:50:28,527
(He has gotten his youth back.)

1314
00:50:28,527 --> 00:50:29,557
I love this.

1315
00:50:29,557 --> 00:50:31,227
I love sudden trips.

1316
00:50:31,527 --> 00:50:32,757
I'm feeling so good.

1317
00:50:32,757 --> 00:50:33,797
(I'm feeling great.)

1318
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:35,357
I love it.

1319
00:50:35,357 --> 00:50:36,357
Hi.

1320
00:50:37,197 --> 00:50:38,297
Hi.

1321
00:50:38,757 --> 00:50:39,797
Hi!

1322
00:50:42,057 --> 00:50:44,227
(He encounters a group of Western tourists.)

1323
00:50:44,227 --> 00:50:46,857
We are the world

1324
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:50,457
We are the children

1325
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:53,127
We are the world

1326
00:50:53,327 --> 00:50:54,857
We should take a picture.

1327
00:50:54,857 --> 00:50:55,857
(They take a picture.)

1328
00:50:55,857 --> 00:50:57,727
One, two, three.

1329
00:50:57,827 --> 00:50:59,797
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1330
00:51:00,497 --> 00:51:01,657
Why do you speak English?

1331
00:51:01,657 --> 00:51:02,697
Thank you.

1332
00:51:02,697 --> 00:51:04,827
Why do you speak English? She's Korean.

1333
00:51:05,227 --> 00:51:07,397
Why do you speak English? Thank you.

1334
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,357
Didn't she speak Korean?

1335
00:51:09,757 --> 00:51:11,427
Seok Jin is...

1336
00:51:12,597 --> 00:51:14,697
- I love this place. - So Min, this place is fantastic.

1337
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:15,927
- Right? - Yes.

1338
00:51:16,597 --> 00:51:18,057
- So Min. - Yes?

1339
00:51:18,197 --> 00:51:19,627
Let's have lunch.

1340
00:51:19,627 --> 00:51:20,697
- Okay. - Let's have lunch.

1341
00:51:20,697 --> 00:51:21,797
Oh, it's takoyaki.

1342
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:23,227
It's takoyaki.

1343
00:51:23,297 --> 00:51:24,427
It looks good.

1344
00:51:24,897 --> 00:51:26,427
- Is that takoyaki? - Yes.

1345
00:51:26,427 --> 00:51:27,497
Takoyaki?

1346
00:51:27,497 --> 00:51:29,697
- It must be a famous place. - It is.

1347
00:51:29,997 --> 00:51:31,327
- It is? - Should we try some?

1348
00:51:31,527 --> 00:51:33,727
Should we play rock-paper-scissors to decide who will pay?

1349
00:51:33,727 --> 00:51:34,797
Should we do that?

1350
00:51:34,927 --> 00:51:36,527
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1351
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:38,197
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1352
00:51:38,457 --> 00:51:39,827
(Jae Seok wins.)

1353
00:51:40,857 --> 00:51:41,997
Rock-paper-scissors

1354
00:51:42,127 --> 00:51:43,797
(Seok Jin loses.)

1355
00:51:43,797 --> 00:51:44,997
Thank you.

1356
00:51:44,997 --> 00:51:46,357
Thank you, Seok Jin.

1357
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,427
(Welcome)

1358
00:51:49,527 --> 00:51:51,727
- They look so tasty. - They look amazing.

1359
00:51:51,827 --> 00:51:53,597
- They're huge. - They look so tasty.

1360
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,297
My goodness.

1361
00:51:55,297 --> 00:51:56,857
We're having takoyaki...

1362
00:51:56,857 --> 00:51:58,827
for lunch in Osaka.

1363
00:51:59,197 --> 00:52:01,997
This morning, I had no idea.

1364
00:52:01,997 --> 00:52:03,357
This is unbelievable.

1365
00:52:03,557 --> 00:52:05,797
They look so tasty.

1366
00:52:06,197 --> 00:52:08,827
(Jae Seok's camera angle is a bit strange.)

1367
00:52:08,997 --> 00:52:10,627
(Surprised)

1368
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,727
They look great.

1369
00:52:13,457 --> 00:52:15,027
Thank you.

1370
00:52:15,027 --> 00:52:17,657
(This is the birthplace of takoyaki.)

1371
00:52:19,397 --> 00:52:21,697
Try it. This is great.

1372
00:52:22,227 --> 00:52:23,527
(He takes a bite.)

1373
00:52:23,527 --> 00:52:24,657
We should...

1374
00:52:25,257 --> 00:52:27,697
find the restaurant and have lunch.

1375
00:52:27,697 --> 00:52:28,727
(They have to find the restaurant.)

1376
00:52:28,727 --> 00:52:29,997
Let's move.

1377
00:52:29,997 --> 00:52:32,357
- Let's cool it down. - Let's do that.

1378
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,697
I'm so excited.

1379
00:52:33,697 --> 00:52:35,327
Isn't it nice?

1380
00:52:35,627 --> 00:52:36,797
Let's try it.

1381
00:52:37,657 --> 00:52:39,757
It's still hot. Be careful.

1382
00:52:39,757 --> 00:52:41,657
(There are not many.)

1383
00:52:41,657 --> 00:52:43,157
They taste great.

1384
00:52:43,157 --> 00:52:44,227
(He takes the tray in his hands.)

1385
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:45,427
It's too hot.

1386
00:52:45,427 --> 00:52:46,797
You just have to eat it...

1387
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:48,627
- There's so much octopus in it. - even if it's hot.

1388
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:50,297
It tastes great.

1389
00:52:50,297 --> 00:52:52,527
(They eat,)

1390
00:52:52,527 --> 00:52:55,527
(eat,)

1391
00:52:55,527 --> 00:52:57,257
(and eat.)

1392
00:52:57,657 --> 00:52:58,727
Well...

1393
00:53:02,327 --> 00:53:03,827
Is this your lunch?

1394
00:53:05,797 --> 00:53:07,127
(He finished 5 pieces in a flash.)

1395
00:53:07,127 --> 00:53:08,997
You had five pieces.

1396
00:53:09,427 --> 00:53:10,527
So Min.

1397
00:53:10,727 --> 00:53:12,327
Seok Jin has already had lunch.

1398
00:53:12,327 --> 00:53:13,527
(We're still going to have lunch.)

1399
00:53:13,527 --> 00:53:15,427
He had five pieces of takoyaki.

1400
00:53:15,757 --> 00:53:18,357
(This takoyaki tastes great.)

1401
00:53:19,797 --> 00:53:21,057
Where's So Min?

1402
00:53:21,827 --> 00:53:23,097
(So Min has disappeared?)

1403
00:53:23,097 --> 00:53:24,597
Where did she go?

1404
00:53:25,357 --> 00:53:27,797
(She talks to someone.)

1405
00:53:29,157 --> 00:53:31,097
(30 minutes ago)

1406
00:53:33,197 --> 00:53:34,357
- Wait. - Wait.

1407
00:53:34,457 --> 00:53:35,657
- What did you say? - What does it mean?

1408
00:53:35,957 --> 00:53:37,257
Is it a line from a drama?

1409
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:38,397
(Is she good at Japanese?)

1410
00:53:40,197 --> 00:53:41,927
Suzuki's bathhouse...

1411
00:53:42,157 --> 00:53:44,297
Where is the bathhouse?

1412
00:53:44,297 --> 00:53:47,057
(Where is the bathhouse?)

1413
00:53:47,297 --> 00:53:48,357
Bathhouse...

1414
00:53:48,397 --> 00:53:49,597
In Dotonbori?

1415
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:51,157
- Yes. - That way.

1416
00:53:51,157 --> 00:53:52,457
(Dotonbori is that way.)

1417
00:53:52,457 --> 00:53:53,927
Is it in Dotonbori?

1418
00:53:53,927 --> 00:53:55,857
Is it in Dotonbori?

1419
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:58,257
What should I do? They're Japanese.

1420
00:53:59,997 --> 00:54:02,427
(They manage to find each other.)

1421
00:54:02,427 --> 00:54:04,857
(She keeps exploring the place on her own.)

1422
00:54:05,727 --> 00:54:06,897
Where's So Min?

1423
00:54:06,897 --> 00:54:08,157
She has disappeared again.

1424
00:54:08,397 --> 00:54:09,697
Where did she go?

1425
00:54:10,327 --> 00:54:12,227
(She carries out a mission on her own.)

1426
00:54:12,327 --> 00:54:13,557
Where is So Min?

1427
00:54:13,657 --> 00:54:15,327
- Hey! - The thing we've said the most...

1428
00:54:15,327 --> 00:54:17,097
- in Japan is, "Where is So Min?" - So Min!

1429
00:54:17,697 --> 00:54:19,627
(She's shopping bath products.)

1430
00:54:19,627 --> 00:54:21,327
- We need some lotion... - Should we get something?

1431
00:54:21,327 --> 00:54:22,797
- if we're going to have a bath. - You're right.

1432
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:25,997
Excuse me.

1433
00:54:27,657 --> 00:54:29,427
You were here.

1434
00:54:29,427 --> 00:54:31,097
(They've finally found each other.)

1435
00:54:33,257 --> 00:54:35,357
- This place is nice. - I love it.

1436
00:54:35,627 --> 00:54:37,727
- Seok Jin, come here. - Seok Jin.

1437
00:54:38,327 --> 00:54:40,327
- We have to get tickets. - What are you doing?

1438
00:54:41,227 --> 00:54:42,597
- Are we going to eat here? - Yes.

1439
00:54:43,497 --> 00:54:45,297
- Let's eat here. - What do they have?

1440
00:54:45,357 --> 00:54:46,697
- Ramen. - Ramen.

1441
00:54:46,697 --> 00:54:47,957
Ramen?

1442
00:54:47,957 --> 00:54:49,257
It looks tasty.

1443
00:54:49,727 --> 00:54:53,427
(Rich broth and chewy noodles)

1444
00:54:53,427 --> 00:54:55,157
This is interesting.

1445
00:54:55,657 --> 00:54:57,357
- This is... - What is this?

1446
00:54:58,297 --> 00:55:00,757
Noodles in soup with extra...

1447
00:55:00,757 --> 00:55:02,157
(They have to use a machine to order.)

1448
00:55:02,157 --> 00:55:04,057
This one has pork too.

1449
00:55:04,057 --> 00:55:05,597
- Let's take that one. - Okay.

1450
00:55:06,457 --> 00:55:07,727
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1451
00:55:07,727 --> 00:55:09,927
(Jae Seok loses.)

1452
00:55:09,927 --> 00:55:10,997
Okay.

1453
00:55:10,997 --> 00:55:12,057
- Was this your plan? - Thank you.

1454
00:55:12,057 --> 00:55:13,127
- No. - No.

1455
00:55:13,127 --> 00:55:14,627
We don't do such a thing.

1456
00:55:14,627 --> 00:55:15,627
Insert it here.

1457
00:55:15,627 --> 00:55:16,657
(They have to order.)

1458
00:55:16,657 --> 00:55:17,827
That's where tickets come out.

1459
00:55:18,927 --> 00:55:20,757
(How...)

1460
00:55:20,757 --> 00:55:22,997
(does this machine work?)

1461
00:55:22,997 --> 00:55:24,897
This is hard.

1462
00:55:24,897 --> 00:55:26,057
It doesn't light up.

1463
00:55:26,827 --> 00:55:27,957
You have to press this.

1464
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:29,757
I think it's this one.

1465
00:55:29,757 --> 00:55:31,527
Hold on.

1466
00:55:31,527 --> 00:55:32,627
(If it's hard to order three bowls at the same time...)

1467
00:55:32,627 --> 00:55:34,597
- There's only one solution. - Order them separately.

1468
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:35,597
Exactly.

1469
00:55:35,597 --> 00:55:36,997
(They'll order one bowl at a time.)

1470
00:55:36,997 --> 00:55:39,057
- That's a good idea. - Order three times.

1471
00:55:39,197 --> 00:55:40,457
- And... - Hold on.

1472
00:55:40,457 --> 00:55:41,557
Wait.

1473
00:55:41,727 --> 00:55:43,327
- Wait. - You have to insert the money.

1474
00:55:43,327 --> 00:55:45,597
- That was why. - You have to insert the money.

1475
00:55:45,597 --> 00:55:48,097
(They should have inserted the money first.)

1476
00:55:48,497 --> 00:55:49,757
- There you go. - It worked.

1477
00:55:50,157 --> 00:55:51,397
Two dollars.

1478
00:55:51,397 --> 00:55:53,057
(They're done ordering the food.)

1479
00:55:53,157 --> 00:55:54,227
We can finally eat now.

1480
00:55:54,227 --> 00:55:55,727
We're having ramen.

1481
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:56,797
(How will the ramen taste?)

1482
00:55:56,797 --> 00:55:58,557
I wonder how it'll taste.

1483
00:55:58,557 --> 00:56:01,397
You can smell...

1484
00:56:01,427 --> 00:56:03,897
- the pork broth. - Yes.

1485
00:56:04,257 --> 00:56:05,897
(Tourists are taking pictures.)

1486
00:56:06,557 --> 00:56:08,427
I'm sorry to make it inconvenient for you two.

1487
00:56:08,427 --> 00:56:09,697
No, I'm sorry.

1488
00:56:09,857 --> 00:56:11,857
I'm the one who should apologize.

1489
00:56:12,527 --> 00:56:13,657
- So Min. - Yes?

1490
00:56:13,657 --> 00:56:17,227
It must be very new to you.

1491
00:56:17,227 --> 00:56:18,527
- Yes. - Right?

1492
00:56:19,127 --> 00:56:20,197
I'm sorry.

1493
00:56:20,197 --> 00:56:22,697
They just care a lot about me, that's all.

1494
00:56:22,997 --> 00:56:24,657
Please understand.

1495
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:26,157
The staff should understand too.

1496
00:56:26,157 --> 00:56:27,757
- It's not because of you. - I'm sorry.

1497
00:56:27,757 --> 00:56:30,497
It's so hard to even get some lunch.

1498
00:56:32,127 --> 00:56:33,127
I'm sorry.

1499
00:56:33,697 --> 00:56:37,457
(While they're being narcissistic,)

1500
00:56:37,457 --> 00:56:38,457
(the ramen is prepared.)

1501
00:56:38,457 --> 00:56:39,657
It's here.

1502
00:56:40,457 --> 00:56:41,627
It's here.

1503
00:56:41,627 --> 00:56:43,527
(Steaming)

1504
00:56:43,627 --> 00:56:44,757
This...

1505
00:56:44,757 --> 00:56:46,997
So Min, I'm so curious how it'll taste.

1506
00:56:47,097 --> 00:56:48,427
Thank you for the meal.

1507
00:56:48,427 --> 00:56:51,457
(Minced garlic is added.)

1508
00:56:51,457 --> 00:56:52,757
Where's Seok Jin?

1509
00:56:52,957 --> 00:56:54,427
We can just leave him behind.

1510
00:56:54,427 --> 00:56:55,697
(Chives are added too.)

1511
00:56:55,697 --> 00:56:57,597
(Let's start.)

1512
00:56:57,597 --> 00:56:58,627
What do you think?

1513
00:56:59,557 --> 00:57:00,557
It tastes good.

1514
00:57:01,797 --> 00:57:02,997
It's tasty.

1515
00:57:04,757 --> 00:57:06,857
(Wait.)

1516
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:08,997
(What is this perfect combination of flavors?)

1517
00:57:10,797 --> 00:57:11,857
It tastes great.

1518
00:57:13,657 --> 00:57:15,627
(Jae Seok starts eating.)

1519
00:57:15,627 --> 00:57:19,897
(He takes big bites.)

1520
00:57:22,727 --> 00:57:23,797
This is nice.

1521
00:57:24,397 --> 00:57:25,657
It tastes good.

1522
00:57:25,657 --> 00:57:31,557
(So Min slurps continuously.)

1523
00:57:33,057 --> 00:57:34,227
It's tasty.

1524
00:57:34,227 --> 00:57:37,227
(Slurping)

1525
00:57:39,357 --> 00:57:43,427
(She doesn't cut the noodles.)

1526
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:46,157
I don't know how this ramen compares to other dishes.

1527
00:57:46,157 --> 00:57:48,227
(She slurps without taking a break.)

1528
00:57:48,227 --> 00:57:49,657
Perhaps it tastes better because I am hungry.

1529
00:57:50,797 --> 00:57:52,257
(Meanwhile, Seok Jin...)

1530
00:57:52,257 --> 00:57:53,357
(slurps a little.)

1531
00:57:53,357 --> 00:57:55,127
(He cuts the noodles right away.)

1532
00:57:56,127 --> 00:57:57,697
(He groans like a middle-aged man.)

1533
00:57:58,797 --> 00:58:00,457
It's savory.

1534
00:58:00,457 --> 00:58:02,497
It's bit spicy.

1535
00:58:03,797 --> 00:58:05,157
It's really good.

1536
00:58:05,157 --> 00:58:07,897
The more I eat it, the better it tastes.

1537
00:58:07,897 --> 00:58:09,227
(The more you eat,)

1538
00:58:09,227 --> 00:58:11,957
(the bigger bites you want.)

1539
00:58:13,727 --> 00:58:14,757
This is nice.

1540
00:58:14,797 --> 00:58:17,157
- I am serious. It's really tasty. - It's really tasty.

1541
00:58:17,157 --> 00:58:18,657
It's a bit...

1542
00:58:18,657 --> 00:58:19,757
small.

1543
00:58:20,457 --> 00:58:23,057
Thank you, So Min. It's delicious.

1544
00:58:23,757 --> 00:58:25,457
I don't usually add rice to ramen soup.

1545
00:58:27,597 --> 00:58:28,657
(They groan like middle-aged men.)

1546
00:58:29,327 --> 00:58:31,327
- It's really tasty. - It's really tasty.

1547
00:58:31,327 --> 00:58:33,257
(So Min inhales the dish.)

1548
00:58:33,257 --> 00:58:35,397
I am not lying when I say it's tasty.

1549
00:58:35,457 --> 00:58:37,327
(I am glad I came to Osaka.)

1550
00:58:37,327 --> 00:58:40,097
(Taipei, Jeju Island, Osaka)

1551
00:58:40,797 --> 00:58:43,127
(Team Taipei begins the tour.)

1552
00:58:44,027 --> 00:58:45,427
(It's a trip with great taste and atmosphere.)

1553
00:58:45,427 --> 00:58:46,897
(Welcome to Taipei, Taiwan.)

1554
00:58:46,897 --> 00:58:48,327
Let's go.

1555
00:58:48,327 --> 00:58:51,227
Let's begin the tour. Gosh, it's hot.

1556
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:54,127
- My goodness. - My goodness. Hello.

1557
00:58:54,127 --> 00:58:56,257
This place makes me realize I am in a foreign country.

1558
00:58:56,257 --> 00:58:59,057
- This is Taiwan. - This is Taiwan.

1559
00:59:00,257 --> 00:59:02,357
I like the atmosphere.

1560
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:04,057
(The center of food and shopping...)

1561
00:59:04,057 --> 00:59:05,057
(has a great atmosphere.)

1562
00:59:05,057 --> 00:59:07,897
The atmosphere is really nice.

1563
00:59:11,127 --> 00:59:14,657
(We are here.)

1564
00:59:14,857 --> 00:59:16,457
(Look at how cool they are.)

1565
00:59:17,327 --> 00:59:18,727
(Haha)

1566
00:59:18,727 --> 00:59:19,757
(Song Ji Hyo)

1567
00:59:20,157 --> 00:59:21,597
(Yang Se Chan)

1568
00:59:22,327 --> 00:59:23,897
(We are...)

1569
00:59:23,897 --> 00:59:27,157
(currently absorbed in the atmosphere of Taiwan.)

1570
00:59:28,497 --> 00:59:30,657
- Danzai noodles. - Danzai noodles.

1571
00:59:30,657 --> 00:59:34,357
The dish looks similar to ulmyeon.

1572
00:59:34,357 --> 00:59:36,357
- It looks like kalguksu. - That's right.

1573
00:59:36,357 --> 00:59:39,227
Kalguksu or ulmyeon.

1574
00:59:39,357 --> 00:59:41,627
This place feels like Hongdae.

1575
00:59:41,627 --> 00:59:43,357
- You are right. - It feels like Hongdae.

1576
00:59:43,357 --> 00:59:45,697
This is incredible. This place is really pretty.

1577
00:59:45,697 --> 00:59:48,127
Haha, that alley looks like Yeonhui-dong.

1578
00:59:48,127 --> 00:59:51,697
You are right. This is very cute. You should take a picture of it.

1579
00:59:51,697 --> 00:59:53,957
Taiwan has a nice atmosphere.

1580
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:56,627
- It's very cute. - It's Running Man.

1581
00:59:56,957 --> 00:59:59,597
Taipei and Running Man go incredibly well together.

1582
00:59:59,597 --> 01:00:00,827
I don't know what to do.

1583
01:00:00,857 --> 01:00:02,797
- There is mango shaved ice. - My goodness.

1584
01:00:02,797 --> 01:00:05,257
- This place is the best. - You are right.

1585
01:00:05,257 --> 01:00:08,227
Let's come back here later. That restaurant is the best.

1586
01:00:08,227 --> 01:00:10,057
- It's peking duck. - Peking duck.

1587
01:00:10,057 --> 01:00:12,857
(Peking duck looks impressive.)

1588
01:00:14,497 --> 01:00:16,897
- It looks really tasty. - My goodness.

1589
01:00:16,897 --> 01:00:18,897
- It's chicken. - I don't know what to do.

1590
01:00:18,997 --> 01:00:20,527
It looks incredible.

1591
01:00:20,527 --> 01:00:23,897
There are so many clean venues that serve delicious dishes.

1592
01:00:23,897 --> 01:00:25,127
(I want to eat everything.)

1593
01:00:25,257 --> 01:00:26,857
- Tripe. - My goodness.

1594
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,057
- What's that? - It's tripe.

1595
01:00:29,057 --> 01:00:30,097
- Right? - Tripe?

1596
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:31,697
What is that?

1597
01:00:32,157 --> 01:00:34,857
This is danzai... Danzai...

1598
01:00:34,857 --> 01:00:36,427
Danzai noodles.

1599
01:00:36,427 --> 01:00:37,697
This is the dish.

1600
01:00:37,697 --> 01:00:39,957
- Is this the right dish? - Danzai noodles. This is the dish.

1601
01:00:39,997 --> 01:00:42,057
Thank you. Danzai noodles?

1602
01:00:42,257 --> 01:00:45,127
- Danzai noodles. - They have the dish. Let's go.

1603
01:00:45,127 --> 01:00:47,697
The menu is in Korean, too.

1604
01:00:47,897 --> 01:00:50,727
(The considerate menu makes the mission easier.)

1605
01:00:50,727 --> 01:00:54,657
(Danzai noodles is a dish which originated from Tainan.)

1606
01:00:54,657 --> 01:00:58,957
(It is made with mung bean sprouts, cilantro, shrimp, and minced meat.)

1607
01:01:00,527 --> 01:01:03,597
(Its rich meat broth satisfies the five senses.)

1608
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:06,897
(They only need to order now.)

1609
01:01:06,897 --> 01:01:08,827
- The menu is in Korean, too. - Best of the best.

1610
01:01:10,257 --> 01:01:12,827
The best product. Wait, I said, "product" in Korean.

1611
01:01:12,897 --> 01:01:15,357
Danzai noodles.

1612
01:01:15,357 --> 01:01:16,957
Three, please.

1613
01:01:16,957 --> 01:01:19,757
Also... Wait, wait.

1614
01:01:21,527 --> 01:01:23,797
You continue to mix English and Korean.

1615
01:01:23,797 --> 01:01:24,827
(Choose a language.)

1616
01:01:24,827 --> 01:01:25,827
(Embarrassed)

1617
01:01:27,597 --> 01:01:29,627
Is this roll tasty? Let's eat fried shrimp.

1618
01:01:29,627 --> 01:01:31,727
- She said it's tasty. - Are you in Korea?

1619
01:01:31,727 --> 01:01:33,597
- You are in a foreign country. - People understand.

1620
01:01:33,597 --> 01:01:35,997
- People understand. - We are the world.

1621
01:01:35,997 --> 01:01:38,857
- I can communicate using Korean. - We have the best teamwork.

1622
01:01:38,857 --> 01:01:41,857
- We are doing great. - I feel bad for other teams.

1623
01:01:41,857 --> 01:01:44,427
Should we give them a call?

1624
01:01:44,427 --> 01:01:45,427
Let's do that.

1625
01:01:46,257 --> 01:01:48,327
Should we call the team in Osaka?

1626
01:01:48,327 --> 01:01:50,227
- Osaka? - Should we call Team Osaka?

1627
01:01:51,497 --> 01:01:53,457
I am answering a video call from Ji Hyo.

1628
01:01:53,497 --> 01:01:55,327
Ji Hyo. Did you answer the call?

1629
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:57,357
- Ji Hyo. - Where are you?

1630
01:01:57,357 --> 01:01:59,227
- Where are you? - Seok Jin.

1631
01:01:59,227 --> 01:02:02,057
- Where are you? - We are in Taiwan.

1632
01:02:02,557 --> 01:02:04,757
- Taiwan? - We are in Osaka, Japan.

1633
01:02:04,757 --> 01:02:07,757
- We are in Osaka. - What is your mission?

1634
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:08,957
"Mission".

1635
01:02:09,157 --> 01:02:10,557
(She pronounced it as if it's a Korean word.)

1636
01:02:10,557 --> 01:02:12,227
How else should I pronounce it?

1637
01:02:12,497 --> 01:02:14,757
- This is green plum liquor. - We are on a food trip.

1638
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:17,127
- What? - Your mission is nice.

1639
01:02:17,157 --> 01:02:18,797
- Green plum? - Green plum?

1640
01:02:18,797 --> 01:02:21,927
You look exhausted because of So Min.

1641
01:02:22,057 --> 01:02:24,757
We are exhausted. She keeps saying she will take care of us.

1642
01:02:24,757 --> 01:02:26,397
I apologize for her behavior.

1643
01:02:26,597 --> 01:02:28,857
You will know when you watch the episode. She runs wild.

1644
01:02:28,957 --> 01:02:30,857
She runs wild.

1645
01:02:30,857 --> 01:02:33,157
Everything looks peaceful over there.

1646
01:02:33,157 --> 01:02:34,957
- I will leave on my own. - We are so confused.

1647
01:02:34,957 --> 01:02:36,857
Look at her. She is leaving on her own.

1648
01:02:37,157 --> 01:02:38,957
What is your mission?

1649
01:02:39,497 --> 01:02:42,597
We need to find Suzuki's bathhouse and take a bath.

1650
01:02:42,697 --> 01:02:43,957
Suzuki's bathhouse?

1651
01:02:43,957 --> 01:02:46,257
- Stop lying. - You are lying.

1652
01:02:46,257 --> 01:02:49,427
I am serious. We are looking for Suzuki's bathhouse.

1653
01:02:49,427 --> 01:02:51,527
We need to go. We will see you later.

1654
01:02:51,527 --> 01:02:53,327
- Okay. - See you later.

1655
01:02:53,327 --> 01:02:54,327
(They end the call after checking up on each other.)

1656
01:02:54,327 --> 01:02:57,257
- Our mission is the best. - It seems that way.

1657
01:02:57,257 --> 01:02:59,757
- The dishes are here. - It's very small.

1658
01:02:59,757 --> 01:03:02,497
- Danzai noodles? - Danzai noodles. Yes.

1659
01:03:02,657 --> 01:03:04,227
The dish is very small.

1660
01:03:04,227 --> 01:03:06,727
We ordered other dishes as well.

1661
01:03:06,727 --> 01:03:11,057
- It smells of meat. - It is topped...

1662
01:03:11,057 --> 01:03:14,227
- with minced meat. - There are mung bean sprouts.

1663
01:03:14,597 --> 01:03:18,057
It looks like miniature pho.

1664
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:20,057
It smells great.

1665
01:03:20,597 --> 01:03:21,957
Ji Hyo will try it first.

1666
01:03:23,797 --> 01:03:25,157
My goodness.

1667
01:03:27,757 --> 01:03:29,857
Se Chan, good job. It tastes amazing.

1668
01:03:29,857 --> 01:03:31,527
- Is it good? - Yes.

1669
01:03:31,857 --> 01:03:32,957
(Slurping)

1670
01:03:35,257 --> 01:03:38,327
Joon Hyun will finish it in one bite.

1671
01:03:38,327 --> 01:03:39,857
(It's self-explanatory.)

1672
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:43,057
- Try it. - I feel bad for other members.

1673
01:03:43,257 --> 01:03:44,257
Haha.

1674
01:03:44,257 --> 01:03:46,597
(He stuffs his mouth with noodles.)

1675
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:49,997
- It's good, right? - It's good, right?

1676
01:03:49,997 --> 01:03:51,327
(He drinks the broth immediately.)

1677
01:03:52,797 --> 01:03:54,157
(My goodness.)

1678
01:03:56,697 --> 01:03:57,697
I was...

1679
01:03:58,657 --> 01:04:00,757
in a program called "Gourmet Road".

1680
01:04:00,757 --> 01:04:02,127
I will describe the taste.

1681
01:04:02,127 --> 01:04:03,857
(Haha will give an assessment of the dish.)

1682
01:04:03,857 --> 01:04:05,097
This taste is...

1683
01:04:06,657 --> 01:04:08,997
crazy.

1684
01:04:09,897 --> 01:04:11,857
(He uses cliche expressions.)

1685
01:04:11,857 --> 01:04:13,027
I am serious.

1686
01:04:13,227 --> 01:04:15,097
It contains a bit of cilantro.

1687
01:04:15,427 --> 01:04:18,427
- It has the taste of Taiwan. - Yes, it has the taste of Taiwan.

1688
01:04:18,997 --> 01:04:21,997
In conclusion,

1689
01:04:22,657 --> 01:04:23,697
- it's crazy. - It's crazy.

1690
01:04:26,157 --> 01:04:28,197
- Do you understand me? - Yes.

1691
01:04:29,227 --> 01:04:31,157
(She doesn't care if the others are talking or not.)

1692
01:04:31,157 --> 01:04:32,627
It has a clean taste.

1693
01:04:32,627 --> 01:04:34,957
(Ji Hyo unleashes her appetite.)

1694
01:04:36,097 --> 01:04:38,227
(She spots another target.)

1695
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:40,057
- Bulgogi. - It tastes like bulgogi.

1696
01:04:40,057 --> 01:04:42,057
(She forgets about the shoot and focuses on the food.)

1697
01:04:42,757 --> 01:04:44,297
It's not too rich.

1698
01:04:44,997 --> 01:04:47,697
I am happy to be in Taiwan with the two of you.

1699
01:04:47,697 --> 01:04:48,797
This is great.

1700
01:04:48,797 --> 01:04:50,357
It's so tasty.

1701
01:04:50,357 --> 01:04:52,997
(We cleared the dishes.)

1702
01:04:53,357 --> 01:04:56,197
I wonder how the other teams are doing.

1703
01:04:56,797 --> 01:04:58,327
- What are they up to? - What are they up to?

1704
01:04:59,997 --> 01:05:01,997
(Jeju Island is raining.)

1705
01:05:01,997 --> 01:05:05,257
I can't believe I am going into the sea.

1706
01:05:05,257 --> 01:05:06,427
Me neither.

1707
01:05:06,427 --> 01:05:08,157
- It doesn't feel real. - I know.

1708
01:05:08,157 --> 01:05:09,157
(Jeju Island is known for its good weather.)

1709
01:05:09,157 --> 01:05:10,597
We will be able to come back, right?

1710
01:05:10,597 --> 01:05:12,597
(However, this is the reality today.)

1711
01:05:12,597 --> 01:05:14,457
What? Okay.

1712
01:05:14,857 --> 01:05:16,157
My goodness.

1713
01:05:17,257 --> 01:05:18,527
How is this happening?

1714
01:05:20,157 --> 01:05:22,657
- So it's really happening. - How is the weather so bad?

1715
01:05:22,657 --> 01:05:25,697
- We are really going into the sea. - This is ridiculous.

1716
01:05:25,697 --> 01:05:27,297
How will we find octopus?

1717
01:05:27,727 --> 01:05:29,727
My goodness, it's so cold.

1718
01:05:29,727 --> 01:05:30,727
(Even the camera sways.)

1719
01:05:31,057 --> 01:05:32,227
What is going on?

1720
01:05:33,157 --> 01:05:34,357
What is going on?

1721
01:05:34,727 --> 01:05:37,457
(How can Jeju Island have this kind of weather?)

1722
01:05:38,027 --> 01:05:39,327
We can't enter the sea in this weather.

1723
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:41,657
(She was hailed as the princess.)

1724
01:05:41,657 --> 01:05:44,557
(She was happy to wear a dress.)

1725
01:05:44,557 --> 01:05:46,657
(She thought she would get to eat...)

1726
01:05:46,657 --> 01:05:49,727
(grilled hairtail, sea urchin, and seaweed soup.)

1727
01:05:49,727 --> 01:05:52,657
(She wanted to make good memories under the sunlight of the island.)

1728
01:05:54,057 --> 01:05:56,697
(How is this happening?)

1729
01:05:57,627 --> 01:06:00,127
(They need to catch an octopus in this weather.)

1730
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:03,157
The wind makes it hard to stand on land.

1731
01:06:04,457 --> 01:06:06,127
How will we find octopus...

1732
01:06:06,657 --> 01:06:08,527
in the open sea?

1733
01:06:08,557 --> 01:06:12,257
Isn't this what you see in the news when there's an incoming storm?

1734
01:06:12,257 --> 01:06:16,597
The waves are very big. Is it safe to enter the water?

1735
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:17,727
(They must catch an octopus to return to Seoul.)

1736
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:20,557
We welcome you to women divers mission.

1737
01:06:20,557 --> 01:06:21,757
You welcome us?

1738
01:06:23,457 --> 01:06:25,727
- They must be serious. - Is this really happening?

1739
01:06:25,727 --> 01:06:28,227
- We are really doing this. - They are not hired by the program.

1740
01:06:28,227 --> 01:06:29,227
(Women divers enter proudly.)

1741
01:06:29,457 --> 01:06:32,457
(They are on the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage.)

1742
01:06:32,457 --> 01:06:36,127
(They gather seafood in all types of weather.)

1743
01:06:36,127 --> 01:06:37,757
(Even the giant octopus...)

1744
01:06:38,597 --> 01:06:40,627
(is an easy prey for them.)

1745
01:06:41,527 --> 01:06:43,427
(They specialize in catching octopus.)

1746
01:06:43,957 --> 01:06:45,727
They are real women divers.

1747
01:06:45,727 --> 01:06:46,857
Hello.

1748
01:06:46,857 --> 01:06:48,897
- Hello. - Hello.

1749
01:06:49,357 --> 01:06:50,597
(It's nice to meet you.)

1750
01:06:50,597 --> 01:06:53,557
Ma'am, do you go into the sea in this kind of weather?

1751
01:06:53,557 --> 01:06:54,927
- No, we don't. - What?

1752
01:06:55,357 --> 01:06:57,357
- No, we don't. - What?

1753
01:06:57,357 --> 01:06:59,357
(What did you say?)

1754
01:06:59,357 --> 01:07:02,497
You can't go in right now. The waves are too strong.

1755
01:07:02,497 --> 01:07:04,327
- You can't go in? - No, you can't.

1756
01:07:04,327 --> 01:07:06,597
- Then why are we going in? - The weather is too bad.

1757
01:07:06,597 --> 01:07:07,797
Then why are we going in?

1758
01:07:07,797 --> 01:07:09,897
You can't go in.

1759
01:07:09,897 --> 01:07:12,997
- You are a real diver, right? - Yes, I am.

1760
01:07:12,997 --> 01:07:16,457
We came here to gather seafood, but had to cancel.

1761
01:07:16,457 --> 01:07:17,757
(They canceled their plans.)

1762
01:07:17,757 --> 01:07:19,857
- What should we do? - That means we can't go in.

1763
01:07:19,857 --> 01:07:21,157
Today...

1764
01:07:21,157 --> 01:07:22,227
(He stifles his laughter.)

1765
01:07:22,897 --> 01:07:25,597
- We won't be able to go in. - We can't catch an octopus.

1766
01:07:25,597 --> 01:07:27,497
I was so ready.

1767
01:07:27,497 --> 01:07:30,097
I really wanted to catch an octopus.

1768
01:07:30,097 --> 01:07:33,897
On our way here, we heard the news that you can't enter the water.

1769
01:07:34,397 --> 01:07:35,427
That's sad.

1770
01:07:35,427 --> 01:07:37,027
- What now? - What now?

1771
01:07:37,027 --> 01:07:38,227
Please.

1772
01:07:38,897 --> 01:07:41,427
- I'll hold it for you. It's heavy. - We're so disappointed.

1773
01:07:41,427 --> 01:07:42,797
- It's okay. - We're so disappointed.

1774
01:07:42,797 --> 01:07:45,057
We'll be back next time to help.

1775
01:07:45,057 --> 01:07:47,257
- Thank you. - Look at the forecast next time.

1776
01:07:47,257 --> 01:07:49,127
- That's right. - We're sorry.

1777
01:07:49,197 --> 01:07:51,527
- It was supposed to rain today. - Yes.

1778
01:07:51,727 --> 01:07:53,497
So we...

1779
01:07:53,697 --> 01:07:56,427
wanted to experience this indirectly...

1780
01:07:56,827 --> 01:07:58,427
(He's flustered.)

1781
01:07:58,427 --> 01:07:59,527
How do I put this?

1782
01:07:59,667 --> 01:08:01,327
Are you making this up?

1783
01:08:01,797 --> 01:08:03,327
- You can't think of it? - No,

1784
01:08:03,427 --> 01:08:05,167
I'm not making anything up.

1785
01:08:05,497 --> 01:08:07,927
One of you will put on the diving suit...

1786
01:08:07,927 --> 01:08:10,097
and eat the octopus ramyeon to complete the mission.

1787
01:08:10,097 --> 01:08:11,927
It must be sold nearby.

1788
01:08:12,057 --> 01:08:14,597
It'll be funny if Kwang Soo puts it on.

1789
01:08:14,597 --> 01:08:15,927
Yes, he'll look like a model.

1790
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:18,957
(We'll see who gets to wear it.)

1791
01:08:19,127 --> 01:08:20,697
Please come over here, ma'am.

1792
01:08:20,697 --> 01:08:22,457
(The women divers will decide who gets the punishment.)

1793
01:08:22,457 --> 01:08:24,167
Please pick somebody who'll look good in it.

1794
01:08:24,727 --> 01:08:25,997
Because...

1795
01:08:25,997 --> 01:08:28,257
(They're thinking seriously.)

1796
01:08:28,257 --> 01:08:30,857
- Look at this broad back. - Madam.

1797
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:33,797
I don't think I'll fit into diving suits.

1798
01:08:33,797 --> 01:08:36,667
- I'm over 2m tall. - He looks like a model.

1799
01:08:37,127 --> 01:08:40,327
- I'm over 2m tall. - It'll be funny for a tall person.

1800
01:08:40,327 --> 01:08:42,327
- I don't agree. - Let's do it for fun.

1801
01:08:42,357 --> 01:08:44,297
Please go ahead...

1802
01:08:44,297 --> 01:08:47,727
and stand behind the person who'll look the best in the suit.

1803
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:52,357
(One person will have the honor of wearing the diving suit.)

1804
01:08:52,357 --> 01:08:55,797
(The chosen one will have the chance to look great in it.)

1805
01:08:57,097 --> 01:08:59,197
(They'll be picked by the women divers.)

1806
01:08:59,197 --> 01:09:00,997
Which star will look the best in the diving suit?

1807
01:09:01,997 --> 01:09:04,327
In 1, 2, 3.

1808
01:09:04,327 --> 01:09:05,457
(Who will it be?)

1809
01:09:08,127 --> 01:09:10,597
(It's Model Lee Kwang Soo.)

1810
01:09:11,097 --> 01:09:12,997
Thank you. You're the best.

1811
01:09:12,997 --> 01:09:14,957
- He's a model. - Thank you.

1812
01:09:14,957 --> 01:09:16,427
- He's a model. - Madam.

1813
01:09:16,427 --> 01:09:18,027
- He'll look great. - Thank you.

1814
01:09:18,357 --> 01:09:20,497
- Thanks so much. - Thank you.

1815
01:09:20,697 --> 01:09:23,757
- I feel happy. - Oh, dear.

1816
01:09:24,597 --> 01:09:26,827
- You're skinny... - And tall.

1817
01:09:26,827 --> 01:09:28,167
- You also have a nice body. - That's right.

1818
01:09:28,167 --> 01:09:29,397
You're handsome too.

1819
01:09:29,397 --> 01:09:31,257
- That's right. - I agree.

1820
01:09:31,697 --> 01:09:32,727
He's so happy.

1821
01:09:32,727 --> 01:09:34,257
- This is great. - You didn't have to.

1822
01:09:34,497 --> 01:09:36,497
- Don't say that. - He's happy.

1823
01:09:37,127 --> 01:09:39,727
Don't say that in front of others.

1824
01:09:40,627 --> 01:09:41,727
It worked out.

1825
01:09:41,727 --> 01:09:43,357
(Let's see his fashion.)

1826
01:09:43,357 --> 01:09:45,127
- You can come out. - Come out.

1827
01:09:46,757 --> 01:09:47,857
Come out.

1828
01:09:52,097 --> 01:09:54,957
(He looks pretty good.)

1829
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:56,167
You look good.

1830
01:09:56,597 --> 01:09:58,457
- He looks good. - Wait a minute.

1831
01:09:58,457 --> 01:10:00,427
(He's satisfied himself.)

1832
01:10:00,427 --> 01:10:02,057
Doesn't he have to put this on?

1833
01:10:02,057 --> 01:10:03,227
- There's a hood. - The hood?

1834
01:10:03,227 --> 01:10:05,167
- There's a hood? - You have to put it on.

1835
01:10:05,327 --> 01:10:06,597
This looks too good.

1836
01:10:06,597 --> 01:10:07,997
You look so fashionable.

1837
01:10:08,757 --> 01:10:11,827
- What hood? - It's the seal-looking one.

1838
01:10:11,827 --> 01:10:14,857
- I forgot. - You did forget.

1839
01:10:14,857 --> 01:10:17,457
You have to wear it. That's right.

1840
01:10:19,357 --> 01:10:20,697
She's putting it on for him.

1841
01:10:20,757 --> 01:10:23,027
- Put it on. - That's the right way to put it on.

1842
01:10:24,057 --> 01:10:26,097
Is it always this hard to put it on?

1843
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:27,697
Ma'am.

1844
01:10:27,697 --> 01:10:29,397
- You look like a monkey. - It's good.

1845
01:10:29,397 --> 01:10:31,457
- Is this how you put it on? - Yes.

1846
01:10:31,457 --> 01:10:34,057
- Is this right? - Oh, dear.

1847
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,327
(The divers have fallen for his beauty.)

1848
01:10:36,327 --> 01:10:38,427
- Is this right? - Yes.

1849
01:10:38,627 --> 01:10:40,167
What about the goggles? Right.

1850
01:10:40,167 --> 01:10:41,357
- That's good. - Okay.

1851
01:10:41,357 --> 01:10:42,827
(His style has improved.)

1852
01:10:42,827 --> 01:10:44,227
They're so happy.

1853
01:10:44,557 --> 01:10:46,057
It's perfect.

1854
01:10:46,057 --> 01:10:47,427
I can't hear you. Can you speak up?

1855
01:10:47,697 --> 01:10:48,797
You look good.

1856
01:10:48,797 --> 01:10:50,427
- Do I look okay? - You look handsome.

1857
01:10:50,667 --> 01:10:52,167
- Does it look okay? - Yes.

1858
01:10:52,327 --> 01:10:55,227
Your face is so small right now. It's one-twelfth of your height.

1859
01:10:56,097 --> 01:10:57,327
- Really? - Your face is so small.

1860
01:10:57,397 --> 01:10:58,457
I'm so jealous.

1861
01:10:59,057 --> 01:11:01,727
Is this how I look?

1862
01:11:01,927 --> 01:11:04,167
- Why am I frowning so much? - No, you look happy.

1863
01:11:04,497 --> 01:11:05,927
That's it. This is great.

1864
01:11:05,927 --> 01:11:08,357
(Meanwhile, in Osaka...)

1865
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:11,197
- I think we should ask. - Let's ask.

1866
01:11:11,197 --> 01:11:13,327
- Let's ask a Japanese. - Come here, Seok Jin.

1867
01:11:13,697 --> 01:11:17,797
- Let's ask a Japanese person. - Ask about Suzuki.

1868
01:11:18,227 --> 01:11:20,297
- Ask them, So Min. - Those police officers.

1869
01:11:20,297 --> 01:11:21,527
Ask the policemen.

1870
01:11:21,897 --> 01:11:23,827
- Say excuse me. - Excuse me.

1871
01:11:23,827 --> 01:11:25,027
(She asks carefully.)

1872
01:11:25,027 --> 01:11:26,197
(They pass by.)

1873
01:11:27,527 --> 01:11:28,757
- Hey... - Thank you.

1874
01:11:28,757 --> 01:11:30,027
I knew it.

1875
01:11:30,097 --> 01:11:32,197
"Excuse me and thank you"?

1876
01:11:32,927 --> 01:11:34,197
Hey.

1877
01:11:35,397 --> 01:11:39,357
(She thanks them as soon as she excuses herself.)

1878
01:11:42,827 --> 01:11:44,667
- Who wants to ask? - Excuse me.

1879
01:11:44,697 --> 01:11:45,927
Excuse me.

1880
01:11:46,957 --> 01:11:50,857
Where's Suzuki in the bathhouse?

1881
01:11:50,927 --> 01:11:51,927
What was that?

1882
01:11:51,927 --> 01:11:54,057
(What was that?)

1883
01:11:54,057 --> 01:11:57,527
(What did you say?)

1884
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:01,197
(They don't know how to reply.)

1885
01:12:01,957 --> 01:12:04,527
- Bathhouse. - Bathhouse.

1886
01:12:04,527 --> 01:12:06,327
- Bathhouse? - Bathhouse.

1887
01:12:06,527 --> 01:12:09,527
Are you talking about bathing? Where you wash yourself?

1888
01:12:10,327 --> 01:12:12,597
(It's the place where you do this.)

1889
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:17,597
- Mr. Suzuki. - Mr. Suzuki.

1890
01:12:17,597 --> 01:12:18,627
(Let me see.)

1891
01:12:18,627 --> 01:12:21,167
Is Mr. Suzuki's bathhouse...

1892
01:12:21,167 --> 01:12:23,427
a liquor bottle?

1893
01:12:24,927 --> 01:12:26,327
(What are they saying?)

1894
01:12:27,257 --> 01:12:30,627
If you go straight from the lights, there's a bathhouse.

1895
01:12:31,527 --> 01:12:33,597
But I don't know if it's Mr. Suzuki's.

1896
01:12:34,727 --> 01:12:36,197
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1897
01:12:36,327 --> 01:12:37,427
- So... - So...

1898
01:12:37,427 --> 01:12:39,857
after listening to her...

1899
01:12:40,227 --> 01:12:42,057
(They just laugh.)

1900
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:43,457
You're trying to guess.

1901
01:12:43,457 --> 01:12:45,457
- You found out when she did this. - Don't try to guess.

1902
01:12:45,457 --> 01:12:47,497
I heard it exactly.

1903
01:12:47,757 --> 01:12:49,757
It's like she was saying, "I'm not too sure."

1904
01:12:49,757 --> 01:12:52,757
- No, what she said was... - "That might not be it."

1905
01:12:52,927 --> 01:12:55,527
"There's a bathhouse if you go this way,"

1906
01:12:55,527 --> 01:12:59,667
"but I'm not sure if it's Mr. Suzuki's."

1907
01:13:00,127 --> 01:13:02,727
(There's a bathhouse if you go this way,)

1908
01:13:02,727 --> 01:13:06,857
(but I'm not sure if it's Mr. Suzuki's.)

1909
01:13:06,857 --> 01:13:08,597
(They translated by looking at her.)

1910
01:13:08,597 --> 01:13:09,697
Excuse me.

1911
01:13:09,697 --> 01:13:12,027
(They ask another person just to make sure.)

1912
01:13:12,357 --> 01:13:13,527
Mr. Suzuki...

1913
01:13:13,697 --> 01:13:15,097
- Mr. Suzuki? - Yes, Mr. Suzuki.

1914
01:13:15,327 --> 01:13:17,697
Where's Mr. Suzuki's bathhouse?

1915
01:13:17,897 --> 01:13:20,327
- Bathhouse. - Bathhouse.

1916
01:13:20,757 --> 01:13:23,667
(They all pretend like they're taking a bath.)

1917
01:13:23,927 --> 01:13:25,857
- It's a bathhouse called Suzuki? - Yes.

1918
01:13:28,257 --> 01:13:29,927
There's a bathhouse across the street.

1919
01:13:30,727 --> 01:13:33,127
But I'm not sure if it's called Suzuki.

1920
01:13:33,457 --> 01:13:36,127
- There's a bathhouse across. - Did you understand?

1921
01:13:36,127 --> 01:13:37,257
Of course, I did.

1922
01:13:37,327 --> 01:13:38,597
That's what she said.

1923
01:13:38,597 --> 01:13:40,397
- Thank you so much. - Thank you so much.

1924
01:13:40,397 --> 01:13:41,557
What did she say?

1925
01:13:41,557 --> 01:13:43,557
- This is what she did. - Did you understand her?

1926
01:13:43,557 --> 01:13:45,757
- You understood her, right? - She said, "It's quite tricky."

1927
01:13:45,757 --> 01:13:48,327
- No, she said this. - What did she say?

1928
01:13:48,627 --> 01:13:50,527
"There's a bathhouse nearby,"

1929
01:13:50,667 --> 01:13:52,797
"but I'm not sure if it's Mr. Suzuki's."

1930
01:13:53,667 --> 01:13:55,227
You're guessing.

1931
01:13:55,227 --> 01:13:58,127
You're supposed to understand language by gestures.

1932
01:13:58,297 --> 01:14:01,457
But how are we supposed to find Mr. Suzuki?

1933
01:14:01,857 --> 01:14:03,027
Where's his bathhouse?

1934
01:14:04,727 --> 01:14:06,327
(I have to step up.)

1935
01:14:06,397 --> 01:14:08,927
Mr. Suzuki's...

1936
01:14:09,597 --> 01:14:10,757
bathhouse...

1937
01:14:11,097 --> 01:14:13,197
(He pretends to bathe himself.)

1938
01:14:14,257 --> 01:14:15,757
Where?

1939
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,897
(Jae Seok asks on his own.)

1940
01:14:19,927 --> 01:14:21,127
Excuse me.

1941
01:14:23,097 --> 01:14:26,197
(He repeats the question again.)

1942
01:14:26,197 --> 01:14:28,757
(He's been asking about the bathhouse for two hours.)

1943
01:14:28,757 --> 01:14:30,927
(Mr. Suzuki's bathhouse?)

1944
01:14:31,957 --> 01:14:34,797
(Please tell me you know.)

1945
01:14:34,927 --> 01:14:38,597
I know where the bathhouse is. Should I try looking for it?

1946
01:14:39,357 --> 01:14:41,227
You're looking it up.

1947
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:42,627
Yes, please.

1948
01:14:43,127 --> 01:14:45,427
- He's looking it up. - He is too.

1949
01:14:47,897 --> 01:14:49,427
There's a Sumoto Hot Spring nearby.

1950
01:14:49,627 --> 01:14:50,757
Where?

1951
01:14:50,757 --> 01:14:51,857
(He can't tell.)

1952
01:14:51,857 --> 01:14:53,327
Here? Mr. Suzuki?

1953
01:14:53,327 --> 01:14:55,297
I'm not sure if it's Mr. Suzuki's.

1954
01:14:56,297 --> 01:14:58,297
Can you unlock the pattern?

1955
01:15:00,357 --> 01:15:02,397
(Everybody in the world does down and right.)

1956
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:04,697
Everybody's similar. It's simple.

1957
01:15:04,797 --> 01:15:05,957
Here.

1958
01:15:06,397 --> 01:15:08,197
I found it.

1959
01:15:08,197 --> 01:15:09,757
I found it.

1960
01:15:09,757 --> 01:15:11,297
(Excuse me. He found it.)

1961
01:15:11,727 --> 01:15:13,427
(Go ahead.)

1962
01:15:14,497 --> 01:15:16,297
- Thank you. Bye. - Mr. Suzuki's here?

1963
01:15:16,797 --> 01:15:19,027
- Take a picture of this. - Try it.

1964
01:15:19,027 --> 01:15:21,457
- Go ahead. - Hold on. How do I do this?

1965
01:15:23,057 --> 01:15:24,557
Can we ask him to send it to us?

1966
01:15:24,557 --> 01:15:26,497
(That's a good idea.)

1967
01:15:26,527 --> 01:15:28,727
- Then we'll become friends. - We need his number.

1968
01:15:29,027 --> 01:15:30,167
We have to be friends?

1969
01:15:30,457 --> 01:15:32,167
- Don't do that. - I mean...

1970
01:15:32,167 --> 01:15:34,197
- I'm sorry. - Where's the address?

1971
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:37,127
Address?

1972
01:15:37,557 --> 01:15:40,697
(They're friends already.)

1973
01:15:41,327 --> 01:15:43,757
- "Three people". - It's every Saturday.

1974
01:15:44,257 --> 01:15:45,897
If it's more than three people, it's free.

1975
01:15:46,457 --> 01:15:49,027
- It's free if it's more than three? - No?

1976
01:15:49,027 --> 01:15:50,957
- How can you... - Isn't that what it says?

1977
01:15:50,957 --> 01:15:52,527
- Here it is. - Where?

1978
01:15:53,127 --> 01:15:54,527
- This. - Okay.

1979
01:15:54,527 --> 01:15:56,357
(They find something that looks like an address.)

1980
01:15:56,357 --> 01:15:57,557
- That's it. - Thank you.

1981
01:15:57,557 --> 01:16:00,297
- Let's hurry. Thank you. - Thank you.

1982
01:16:00,757 --> 01:16:03,127
We found it.

1983
01:16:03,227 --> 01:16:04,397
How do we get there?

1984
01:16:04,457 --> 01:16:06,797
- Let's take a cab. - What were you saying earlier?

1985
01:16:06,797 --> 01:16:09,027
If it's free for 3, is it free for a group of 50?

1986
01:16:10,627 --> 01:16:12,897
- Come on. - How does that make sense?

1987
01:16:13,097 --> 01:16:15,597
- That's not nice. - Maybe it's 1 free for every 3.

1988
01:16:15,597 --> 01:16:17,427
- You shouldn't forget this. - It should be 1 free for every 3.

1989
01:16:17,427 --> 01:16:18,897
The highlight of today was this.

1990
01:16:18,957 --> 01:16:20,167
"Excuse me."

1991
01:16:20,697 --> 01:16:21,827
"Thank you."

1992
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:22,927
(She was so timid.)

1993
01:16:23,197 --> 01:16:24,957
I saw too.

1994
01:16:24,957 --> 01:16:25,957
(She apologizes and thanks people.)

1995
01:16:27,457 --> 01:16:30,457
- Show him, Seok Jin. - Right, the picture.

1996
01:16:30,757 --> 01:16:31,997
Excuse me.

1997
01:16:32,357 --> 01:16:33,667
- Here. - Okay.

1998
01:16:34,027 --> 01:16:35,297
- Okay? - Okay.

1999
01:16:35,727 --> 01:16:38,457
- Navigation. Okay. - That's right. Thank you.

2000
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:41,127
I wonder if it's Mr. Suzuki's. We need to ask once we get there.

2001
01:16:41,127 --> 01:16:43,427
I know. I hope...

2002
01:16:43,427 --> 01:16:44,697
it's Mr. Suzuki's.

2003
01:16:44,697 --> 01:16:47,957
We came this far. It has to be right.

2004
01:16:47,997 --> 01:16:51,167
Wait a minute. You kind of look like No Ju Hyeon.

2005
01:16:53,227 --> 01:16:54,397
"You punk."

2006
01:16:55,057 --> 01:16:56,257
That's Joo Hyun.

2007
01:16:57,057 --> 01:16:59,297
- Wasn't that No Ju Hyeon? - No.

2008
01:16:59,297 --> 01:17:02,757
We didn't ask for an impression of him.

2009
01:17:04,057 --> 01:17:05,427
That came out of nowhere.

2010
01:17:05,427 --> 01:17:07,257
I've never had someone respond like that.

2011
01:17:07,797 --> 01:17:09,667
- You didn't expect it. - I'm flustered.

2012
01:17:09,997 --> 01:17:13,127
(Actresses usually don't volunteer to do it.)

2013
01:17:13,127 --> 01:17:15,257
(She keeps trying it.)

2014
01:17:16,357 --> 01:17:19,497
Seok Jin is really good at impressions. He used to be so good.

2015
01:17:19,597 --> 01:17:21,357
- It's too old. - It's just too old.

2016
01:17:21,797 --> 01:17:22,957
(I used to be funny.)

2017
01:17:23,197 --> 01:17:25,097
Were you a comedian, Seok Jin?

2018
01:17:25,297 --> 01:17:26,697
You didn't know?

2019
01:17:27,857 --> 01:17:29,827
I debuted four times.

2020
01:17:31,497 --> 01:17:33,627
- Isn't he steadily funny? - Yes, I agree.

2021
01:17:33,857 --> 01:17:35,627
It's like he's a quiet river.

2022
01:17:36,667 --> 01:17:38,197
A small fish jumps up once in a while.

2023
01:17:38,197 --> 01:17:39,827
That's about it.

2024
01:17:40,557 --> 01:17:42,227
Jae Seok...

2025
01:17:42,227 --> 01:17:43,797
is like a valley.

2026
01:17:43,797 --> 01:17:45,397
- A valley? I'm deep, right? - What's that?

2027
01:17:45,397 --> 01:17:46,897
No, it's not deep.

2028
01:17:46,897 --> 01:17:48,297
It keeps on trickling with water.

2029
01:17:49,667 --> 01:17:52,097
The stream bumps against rocks.

2030
01:17:52,097 --> 01:17:53,597
- You're like the current. - I'm like the current.

2031
01:17:53,597 --> 01:17:54,927
- He's the current. - That sounds good.

2032
01:17:54,927 --> 01:17:56,227
I'm like the current.

2033
01:17:56,227 --> 01:17:57,827
- He keeps on chatting away, right? - Yes.

2034
01:17:57,827 --> 01:17:59,197
So Min,

2035
01:17:59,427 --> 01:18:02,757
is it difficult for you to act as a tragic character?

2036
01:18:03,097 --> 01:18:04,527
No, I can do it.

2037
01:18:04,527 --> 01:18:06,097
- Don't you want to do it? - Can you do it?

2038
01:18:06,227 --> 01:18:07,797
- A tragic... - I can do it.

2039
01:18:08,457 --> 01:18:11,257
Can you act as if...

2040
01:18:11,667 --> 01:18:14,097
you're going home after a breakup?

2041
01:18:14,097 --> 01:18:15,727
You can look out the window.

2042
01:18:15,727 --> 01:18:16,757
(She starts acting right away.)

2043
01:18:17,857 --> 01:18:19,557
(I sometimes...)

2044
01:18:19,557 --> 01:18:22,697
(tear up.)

2045
01:18:22,857 --> 01:18:24,997
(I like how...)

2046
01:18:24,997 --> 01:18:27,597
(I cry my heart out and not think about it.)

2047
01:18:27,597 --> 01:18:28,597
Are there any lines?

2048
01:18:29,227 --> 01:18:30,457
I teared up.

2049
01:18:30,457 --> 01:18:31,757
(She teared up.)

2050
01:18:31,757 --> 01:18:33,167
- That's awesome. - I acted with my eyes.

2051
01:18:34,027 --> 01:18:35,557
- I saw her tears. - She's good.

2052
01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:36,827
- So Min, - That was fast.

2053
01:18:36,827 --> 01:18:38,497
you didn't have to do that.

2054
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:40,757
- Why are you crying? - You didn't have to cry.

2055
01:18:40,757 --> 01:18:42,927
- Were you serious? - I'll work hard.

2056
01:18:43,627 --> 01:18:45,397
Drama producers...

2057
01:18:45,997 --> 01:18:47,667
SBS drama producers,

2058
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:49,427
I'll work hard.

2059
01:18:49,427 --> 01:18:50,897
Whom are you talking to?

2060
01:18:51,167 --> 01:18:53,257
Focus on Running Man.

2061
01:18:53,257 --> 01:18:54,827
(Let's find the bathhouse first.)

2062
01:18:54,827 --> 01:18:56,027
- I think we're here. - We're here.

2063
01:18:56,027 --> 01:18:58,327
(They have arrived at their destination.)

2064
01:18:58,327 --> 01:19:00,297
(They came,)

2065
01:19:00,297 --> 01:19:02,757
(but would Mr. Suzuki's bathhouse be here?)

2066
01:19:02,827 --> 01:19:04,597
- So Min. - So Min.

2067
01:19:04,597 --> 01:19:05,997
(So Min)

2068
01:19:07,797 --> 01:19:08,897
Let's...

2069
01:19:08,897 --> 01:19:10,397
not give her time.

2070
01:19:10,397 --> 01:19:13,127
Why do you keep... We keep calling you.

2071
01:19:13,127 --> 01:19:14,697
We are always looking for you.

2072
01:19:14,857 --> 01:19:16,197
When we started out,

2073
01:19:16,197 --> 01:19:18,997
you said you'd look after us.

2074
01:19:18,997 --> 01:19:20,627
Do you know how many times we looked for you?

2075
01:19:20,627 --> 01:19:22,427
We've been repeating...

2076
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:25,227
Mr. Suzuki and your name.

2077
01:19:25,257 --> 01:19:27,197
It's just been you two.

2078
01:19:27,357 --> 01:19:30,797
We keep looking for Mr. Suzuki and you, So Min.

2079
01:19:30,957 --> 01:19:32,227
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2080
01:19:32,227 --> 01:19:33,627
- Where is it? - Let's go.

2081
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:35,027
Let's go. Where is it?

2082
01:19:35,197 --> 01:19:37,097
- Where is it? - Here.

2083
01:19:37,097 --> 01:19:39,357
- Where... - We can't go if we don't know.

2084
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:41,697
- Where's the bathhouse? - Hold on.

2085
01:19:41,757 --> 01:19:43,667
We need to find a similar sign.

2086
01:19:43,667 --> 01:19:46,297
We don't know...

2087
01:19:46,297 --> 01:19:47,357
Where are we?

2088
01:19:47,357 --> 01:19:49,057
That's the sign we saw.

2089
01:19:49,057 --> 01:19:50,357
- It's right. - What is it?

2090
01:19:50,957 --> 01:19:52,127
It's here.

2091
01:19:52,127 --> 01:19:53,997
(Is that the bathhouse?)

2092
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:56,227
(It says something hot spring.)

2093
01:19:56,227 --> 01:19:57,857
- I think it's here. - Please.

2094
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:01,127
(These are the same words they saw before.)

2095
01:20:01,127 --> 01:20:02,397
(They match what they found earlier.)

2096
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:03,667
When I saw it,

2097
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,997
it said they open around 3:30pm.

2098
01:20:05,997 --> 01:20:07,227
- Okay. - If three people come together...

2099
01:20:07,227 --> 01:20:08,227
Here.

2100
01:20:08,297 --> 01:20:10,757
They open at 3:30pm.

2101
01:20:11,197 --> 01:20:12,497
It's 2:45pm right now.

2102
01:20:12,497 --> 01:20:13,957
Should we check if it's run by Mr. Suzuki?

2103
01:20:13,957 --> 01:20:15,727
- Right. - That's what we have to check.

2104
01:20:15,727 --> 01:20:17,997
If 3 people come together, it's 1 free admission.

2105
01:20:17,997 --> 01:20:20,167
It's so nice here. It smells nice.

2106
01:20:20,857 --> 01:20:21,927
This is Japanese...

2107
01:20:22,757 --> 01:20:23,797
Excuse me.

2108
01:20:23,857 --> 01:20:26,257
(Is he...)

2109
01:20:26,257 --> 01:20:28,667
(Mr. Suzuki?)

2110
01:20:28,667 --> 01:20:29,757
Suzuki...

2111
01:20:30,257 --> 01:20:31,397
Mr. Suzuki?

2112
01:20:32,827 --> 01:20:34,097
Yes, you're right.

2113
01:20:35,027 --> 01:20:37,957
(They found Mr. Suzuki in Osaka.)

2114
01:20:37,957 --> 01:20:40,167
- Bathhouse? - Yes, I run the bathhouse.

2115
01:20:40,327 --> 01:20:42,897
- Yes. - Hold on. We have to be sure.

2116
01:20:42,897 --> 01:20:44,127
(They don't know what he's saying.)

2117
01:20:44,127 --> 01:20:46,057
- Wait. - You learned something earlier.

2118
01:20:46,057 --> 01:20:47,397
- Hold on. - Try it.

2119
01:20:47,727 --> 01:20:49,597
I should look it up.

2120
01:20:50,127 --> 01:20:52,667
"Is this Mr. Suzuki's bathhouse?"

2121
01:20:53,397 --> 01:20:55,727
Is this Mr. Suzuki's bathhouse?

2122
01:20:55,727 --> 01:21:01,527
Is this Suzuki... Suzuki's... Bathhouse?

2123
01:21:02,167 --> 01:21:06,027
(Is this Mr. Suzuki's...)

2124
01:21:06,697 --> 01:21:08,697
(He practiced,)

2125
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:12,667
(and practiced, and practiced.)

2126
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:14,697
Mr. Suzuki... Bathhouse...

2127
01:21:15,397 --> 01:21:17,257
(Even So Min practiced in her sleep.)

2128
01:21:17,257 --> 01:21:19,257
(They came this far to ask one question.)

2129
01:21:19,257 --> 01:21:21,857
(Is this Mr. Suzuki's bathhouse?)

2130
01:21:21,857 --> 01:21:24,857
Yes, it's fun.

2131
01:21:25,027 --> 01:21:26,057
(Is he saying yes?)

2132
01:21:26,057 --> 01:21:27,597
- It's right? Mr. Suzuki? - Yes.

2133
01:21:28,127 --> 01:21:30,497
- You're the CEO? - Yes.

2134
01:21:30,497 --> 01:21:32,957
This is Mr. Suzuki's bathhouse.

2135
01:21:33,227 --> 01:21:35,527
(They've been asking for 20 minutes.)

2136
01:21:35,797 --> 01:21:37,227
(It's the name of the bathhouse.)

2137
01:21:37,227 --> 01:21:38,397
- Your brother? - Yes.

2138
01:21:38,397 --> 01:21:40,627
(You're Mr. Suzuki's brother?)

2139
01:21:40,627 --> 01:21:41,927
Are you Suzuki's brother?

2140
01:21:42,227 --> 01:21:43,997
(Well...)

2141
01:21:43,997 --> 01:21:45,557
You're the boss.

2142
01:21:45,557 --> 01:21:46,597
(He's the boss.)

2143
01:21:46,597 --> 01:21:48,927
- Your full name. - My business card.

2144
01:21:49,527 --> 01:21:50,927
Business card?

2145
01:21:50,927 --> 01:21:52,257
- It smells... - It smells nice.

2146
01:21:52,257 --> 01:21:54,667
- like soap here. - It smells like a bathhouse.

2147
01:21:55,697 --> 01:21:56,957
Let's see.

2148
01:21:56,957 --> 01:21:58,757
- Can you read it? - "Mr. Suzuki".

2149
01:21:58,757 --> 01:22:00,257
(He's very precise.)

2150
01:22:00,897 --> 01:22:03,957
(Is that a Korean business card?)

2151
01:22:03,957 --> 01:22:05,557
- I'm right. - You don't know.

2152
01:22:05,557 --> 01:22:07,357
Owned by... Bath...

2153
01:22:07,927 --> 01:22:09,927
(Look at this.)

2154
01:22:11,227 --> 01:22:13,257
- Suzuki? What's your full name? - He's the owner.

2155
01:22:13,667 --> 01:22:15,357
- Junji. - Junji Suzuki?

2156
01:22:15,527 --> 01:22:18,357
(His last name is Suzuki and first name is Junji?)

2157
01:22:18,357 --> 01:22:21,897
(They have confirmed his identity.)

2158
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:24,457
- I'm Jee. - Mr. Jee.

2159
01:22:24,957 --> 01:22:26,457
- Jeon... - Ms. Jeon.

2160
01:22:26,797 --> 01:22:28,427
Ms. Jeon?

2161
01:22:28,427 --> 01:22:29,627
What is your name again?

2162
01:22:29,627 --> 01:22:31,167
- It's So Min. - Yes, So Min.

2163
01:22:31,167 --> 01:22:32,457
- "What is your name?" - Jeon.

2164
01:22:32,457 --> 01:22:34,557
(He's losing his memory.)

2165
01:22:34,557 --> 01:22:35,697
Jeon and Yu.

2166
01:22:35,697 --> 01:22:38,697
- Is it the name for women? - So Min.

2167
01:22:38,697 --> 01:22:40,397
- So Min. - She's cute.

2168
01:22:40,627 --> 01:22:41,827
Thank you.

2169
01:22:41,827 --> 01:22:43,297
- She's cute? - Yes.

2170
01:22:45,457 --> 01:22:47,297
(Japanese people think she's cute too.)

2171
01:22:47,297 --> 01:22:50,297
- You must love it. - That looked so strange.

2172
01:22:51,457 --> 01:22:53,057
(Shaking)

2173
01:22:53,257 --> 01:22:54,397
What was that?

2174
01:22:54,727 --> 01:22:58,167
We have to keep watching her. She has multiple personalities.

2175
01:22:59,257 --> 01:23:01,527
Can we take a bath now?

2176
01:23:01,527 --> 01:23:03,957
This is for men.

2177
01:23:03,957 --> 01:23:06,227
Wait. Let me ask.

2178
01:23:06,227 --> 01:23:09,227
It said 1 admission for 3 people.

2179
01:23:09,397 --> 01:23:11,357
"Is it 1 free admission for 3 people?"

2180
01:23:11,357 --> 01:23:12,727
- Hold on. - Free pass?

2181
01:23:12,727 --> 01:23:14,457
- Three person? - Stop it.

2182
01:23:15,527 --> 01:23:17,757
"I heard it's 1 free admission for 3 people."

2183
01:23:17,927 --> 01:23:19,427
It'll be awesome if it's true.

2184
01:23:19,597 --> 01:23:22,857
I heard it's 1 free admission for 3 people.

2185
01:23:22,957 --> 01:23:23,957
(What is he saying?)

2186
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:25,297
No?

2187
01:23:25,297 --> 01:23:27,827
(Is there 1 free admission?)

2188
01:23:27,827 --> 01:23:28,897
(That's not possible.)

2189
01:23:29,827 --> 01:23:31,697
Can we take a bath now?

2190
01:23:31,697 --> 01:23:33,527
Yes, okay.

2191
01:23:33,927 --> 01:23:35,197
It's boiling.

2192
01:23:35,257 --> 01:23:36,297
- Boiling? - Yes?

2193
01:23:36,297 --> 01:23:38,097
Did he say, "Shy"?

2194
01:23:38,097 --> 01:23:41,627
- Shy? - Shy, shy, I'm shy

2195
01:23:41,627 --> 01:23:42,627
(We're embarrassed by these two.)

2196
01:23:42,627 --> 01:23:46,057
We have a staff member who speaks Japanese so he'll speak.

2197
01:23:46,057 --> 01:23:48,297
Can you ask if we can film...

2198
01:23:48,297 --> 01:23:50,527
before 3:30pm?

2199
01:23:50,527 --> 01:23:53,757
(Can we film before you open at 3:30pm?)

2200
01:23:53,757 --> 01:23:57,557
(It's okay as long as you stop before 3:30pm.)

2201
01:23:58,297 --> 01:23:59,757
- We can film? - Yes.

2202
01:23:59,757 --> 01:24:01,557
Can we go?

2203
01:24:01,557 --> 01:24:03,297
Yes, this way is for men.

2204
01:24:03,297 --> 01:24:04,427
That way's for men.

2205
01:24:04,427 --> 01:24:05,857
This is for women.

2206
01:24:05,857 --> 01:24:07,797
- So Min. - She's cute.

2207
01:24:07,957 --> 01:24:10,167
We don't meet inside, right?

2208
01:24:10,397 --> 01:24:11,757
How much is it for three people?

2209
01:24:11,897 --> 01:24:13,857
4 times 3 is 12. It's 12 dollars.

2210
01:24:13,957 --> 01:24:15,297
- Three people. - Yes.

2211
01:24:15,297 --> 01:24:16,897
(They pay for 3 adults.)

2212
01:24:16,897 --> 01:24:18,927
(Who knew they'd take a bath in Japan?)

2213
01:24:18,927 --> 01:24:20,497
He didn't have to say, "Three people".

2214
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:21,727
See you.

2215
01:24:21,827 --> 01:24:24,197
This is Mr. Suzuki's bathhouse.

2216
01:24:24,197 --> 01:24:25,197
We're here.

2217
01:24:25,197 --> 01:24:26,457
All are welcome here.

2218
01:24:26,457 --> 01:24:28,427
(They finally enter Mr. Suzuki's bathhouse.)

2219
01:24:28,427 --> 01:24:30,397
It's nice.

2220
01:24:30,397 --> 01:24:33,527
(They enter the bathhouse.)

2221
01:24:34,627 --> 01:24:35,997
Look.

2222
01:24:35,997 --> 01:24:37,497
(It's nice here.)

2223
01:24:37,497 --> 01:24:39,297
- It's nice. - It's like those old bathhouses.

2224
01:24:39,297 --> 01:24:40,697
- Are you filming? - Yes.

2225
01:24:41,397 --> 01:24:43,357
- This is a community bathhouse. - It's nice.

2226
01:24:43,457 --> 01:24:46,427
- These are... - It feels like a bathhouse.

2227
01:24:46,427 --> 01:24:47,897
(You can see how detailed Mr. Suzuki is.)

2228
01:24:47,897 --> 01:24:52,927
(The bathhouse is simple and neat.)

2229
01:24:52,927 --> 01:24:54,497
It's been such a long time.

2230
01:24:54,857 --> 01:24:56,297
It's been a long time.

2231
01:24:56,397 --> 01:24:58,457
- We can take a locker. - Let's hurry.

2232
01:24:58,457 --> 01:25:00,057
- We have to hurry. - We have no time.

2233
01:25:00,057 --> 01:25:01,827
(How's So Min in the women's side?)

2234
01:25:02,957 --> 01:25:04,627
It's a real bathhouse.

2235
01:25:06,427 --> 01:25:07,627
The scale.

2236
01:25:08,297 --> 01:25:09,997
It's an old scale.

2237
01:25:10,797 --> 01:25:12,927
It's fascinating. Should I weigh myself?

2238
01:25:14,427 --> 01:25:16,427
(Flapping)

2239
01:25:16,427 --> 01:25:18,497
(She's 52kg.)

2240
01:25:18,497 --> 01:25:20,757
I usually don't weigh this much.

2241
01:25:21,857 --> 01:25:22,897
This scale...

2242
01:25:23,667 --> 01:25:24,997
The needle...

2243
01:25:26,257 --> 01:25:28,427
(She's exactly 52kg.)

2244
01:25:28,427 --> 01:25:29,527
(She's flustered.)

2245
01:25:29,527 --> 01:25:31,257
I ate too much in Japan.

2246
01:25:31,257 --> 01:25:32,897
(She reveals her weight just like that.)

2247
01:25:33,997 --> 01:25:35,697
It's open here.

2248
01:25:35,697 --> 01:25:37,257
- You can talk to each other. - Really?

2249
01:25:37,397 --> 01:25:39,857
- What? - It's open on top.

2250
01:25:40,167 --> 01:25:41,557
- So Min. - Yes?

2251
01:25:41,557 --> 01:25:42,857
Seok Jin, it's...

2252
01:25:43,597 --> 01:25:44,997
- So Min. - Yes?

2253
01:25:44,997 --> 01:25:46,227
Seok Jin, it's...

2254
01:25:46,227 --> 01:25:48,627
Do we have to buy towels?

2255
01:25:49,027 --> 01:25:50,827
That's right. It's 90 cents.

2256
01:25:50,827 --> 01:25:52,197
- Right? - We have to buy towels.

2257
01:25:52,197 --> 01:25:53,197
Hold on.

2258
01:25:54,257 --> 01:25:56,527
It's open, So Min.

2259
01:25:56,527 --> 01:25:57,597
Right.

2260
01:25:57,597 --> 01:26:00,427
(Would Team Osaka be able to complete their mission?)

2261
01:26:00,597 --> 01:26:03,757
Ta-da. This is the bathhouse.

2262
01:26:04,527 --> 01:26:05,727
Can you see this?

2263
01:26:06,397 --> 01:26:10,227
It smells like an old bathhouse.

2264
01:26:10,397 --> 01:26:12,497
These things are so tiny.

2265
01:26:12,697 --> 01:26:13,857
They're so cute.

2266
01:26:13,857 --> 01:26:15,427
(The boiling bathhouse has cute decorations.)

2267
01:26:15,527 --> 01:26:16,627
(Groaning)

2268
01:26:18,097 --> 01:26:19,997
(Shall we go in?)

2269
01:26:21,897 --> 01:26:23,097
(Here comes the first old man.)

2270
01:26:23,097 --> 01:26:25,397
It's nice here. It's so nice.

2271
01:26:26,727 --> 01:26:28,167
- It's nice. - This place...

2272
01:26:28,167 --> 01:26:29,197
(And here's the second old man.)

2273
01:26:30,057 --> 01:26:31,297
(Groaning)

2274
01:26:31,297 --> 01:26:32,297
(Exclaiming)

2275
01:26:32,457 --> 01:26:34,597
- You left your glasses on? - Pardon?

2276
01:26:34,797 --> 01:26:36,427
It's nice here.

2277
01:26:36,427 --> 01:26:37,827
(They're being so loud.)

2278
01:26:37,827 --> 01:26:39,227
It's nice.

2279
01:26:41,797 --> 01:26:43,797
It's so cute.

2280
01:26:44,527 --> 01:26:46,197
(They finish bathing at Mr. Suzuki's bathhouse.)

2281
01:26:46,197 --> 01:26:47,627
It was so nice.

2282
01:26:47,627 --> 01:26:48,797
(They finish bathing at Mr. Suzuki's bathhouse.)

2283
01:26:48,797 --> 01:26:50,997
We have no time. We have to leave.

2284
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:52,697
It's like we're at somebody else's house.

2285
01:26:52,997 --> 01:26:54,427
I need to dry my hair.

2286
01:26:54,957 --> 01:26:56,397
You have to pay. It's 20 cents.

2287
01:26:56,897 --> 01:26:58,927
This is quite...

2288
01:26:58,927 --> 01:27:00,227
private.

2289
01:27:01,297 --> 01:27:03,097
(It's cozy.)

2290
01:27:03,097 --> 01:27:04,557
- It's... - It looks like a library.

2291
01:27:04,597 --> 01:27:06,657
- It's private. - I'm going to do it too.

2292
01:27:06,657 --> 01:27:07,957
There isn't one here.

2293
01:27:08,057 --> 01:27:10,357
As you can see, this is a powder room.

2294
01:27:10,727 --> 01:27:14,297
It's for personal use.

2295
01:27:14,297 --> 01:27:16,297
I'm going to get a massage.

2296
01:27:16,427 --> 01:27:18,297
I'm drying my hair right now.

2297
01:27:18,397 --> 01:27:20,957
- Would 20 cents... - Would it dry?

2298
01:27:20,957 --> 01:27:22,027
(Would he be able to dry his hair with 20 cents?)

2299
01:27:22,027 --> 01:27:24,297
I wasn't sure, but it's enough.

2300
01:27:25,357 --> 01:27:26,627
It lasts a long time.

2301
01:27:26,757 --> 01:27:28,527
It's enough for two.

2302
01:27:29,057 --> 01:27:30,957
(He's become one with the massage chair.)

2303
01:27:31,297 --> 01:27:34,597
I'm done drying my hair. Let me dry Seok Jin's too.

2304
01:27:34,597 --> 01:27:36,727
(Can two people dry their hair with just 20 cents?)

2305
01:27:36,727 --> 01:27:38,827
- Does it still work? - Yes.

2306
01:27:40,197 --> 01:27:41,497
Is it still working?

2307
01:27:41,557 --> 01:27:44,527
- It's still working. - Let's switch. Come here.

2308
01:27:44,627 --> 01:27:45,697
Use the massage chair.

2309
01:27:47,497 --> 01:27:49,297
(They're using their 20 cents to the fullest.)

2310
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:51,557
This lasts a really long time.

2311
01:27:51,557 --> 01:27:52,827
It really does.

2312
01:27:54,097 --> 01:27:55,227
What time is it?

2313
01:27:55,497 --> 01:27:57,297
It's 3:20pm.

2314
01:27:57,297 --> 01:27:59,697
- We need to hurry up. - We need to go.

2315
01:27:59,757 --> 01:28:02,457
(Taipei, Jeju Island, Osaka)

2316
01:28:03,397 --> 01:28:04,397
(Meanwhile, in Taipei...)

2317
01:28:04,397 --> 01:28:07,797
- We succeeded with our first meal. - It was a great success.

2318
01:28:07,897 --> 01:28:11,357
- We did it. - The first meal was a success.

2319
01:28:11,357 --> 01:28:14,827
Let's have beef noodles as our last meal.

2320
01:28:14,827 --> 01:28:16,897
- We should leave that for last. - I'm not lying.

2321
01:28:16,897 --> 01:28:19,697
- I'll just follow your orders. - Look for the stinky tofu dish.

2322
01:28:19,697 --> 01:28:21,597
Okay, I'll do that.

2323
01:28:21,597 --> 01:28:24,127
- Where is the stinky tofu? - Okay.

2324
01:28:24,197 --> 01:28:25,557
Excuse me.

2325
01:28:27,027 --> 01:28:29,327
Where is the restaurant that sells stinky tofu?

2326
01:28:30,197 --> 01:28:33,257
(What?)

2327
01:28:33,257 --> 01:28:35,927
Tofu. Stinky tofu.

2328
01:28:37,097 --> 01:28:38,697
(Stinky tofu?)

2329
01:28:38,697 --> 01:28:40,357
(Tofu?)

2330
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:41,397
(Stinky tofu?)

2331
01:28:41,397 --> 01:28:42,627
We're talking about tofu.

2332
01:28:42,727 --> 01:28:45,527
Stinky... The square-shaped food.

2333
01:28:45,857 --> 01:28:49,357
- Stinky tofu. Stinky tofu. - Haha.

2334
01:28:49,357 --> 01:28:51,697
- This place just sells socks. - Stinky tofu.

2335
01:28:51,697 --> 01:28:53,897
- Why are you asking here? - This place sells socks.

2336
01:28:53,897 --> 01:28:57,357
- We should go to a restaurant. - Why are you asking for tofu here?

2337
01:28:57,357 --> 01:28:58,557
(Embarrassed)

2338
01:28:59,097 --> 01:29:01,357
People who sell socks tend to be nice.

2339
01:29:01,357 --> 01:29:03,757
You're right. Haha, look here.

2340
01:29:03,757 --> 01:29:05,927
(If you have trouble abroad, just go to a place that sells socks.)

2341
01:29:05,927 --> 01:29:07,657
- Stinky tofu. - What's this?

2342
01:29:08,357 --> 01:29:09,357
Stinky tofu.

2343
01:29:09,357 --> 01:29:11,397
(They continuously...)

2344
01:29:11,397 --> 01:29:14,997
(look for stinky tofu.)

2345
01:29:14,997 --> 01:29:16,697
We're looking for stinky tofu.

2346
01:29:16,697 --> 01:29:18,697
- They don't sell it here. - This place sells ribs.

2347
01:29:18,697 --> 01:29:21,397
I think they only sell side dishes.

2348
01:29:21,697 --> 01:29:23,027
- Do you sell stinky tofu? - Stinky tofu?

2349
01:29:23,027 --> 01:29:24,327
- No, no. - You don't have it?

2350
01:29:25,097 --> 01:29:27,827
(They eagerly look for stinky tofu.)

2351
01:29:27,827 --> 01:29:28,827
No?

2352
01:29:29,027 --> 01:29:30,827
A lot of celebrities must've came here.

2353
01:29:30,827 --> 01:29:32,027
(Does this restaurant sell stinky tofu?)

2354
01:29:32,497 --> 01:29:34,357
Isn't that stinky tofu?

2355
01:29:35,197 --> 01:29:36,457
Stinky tofu.

2356
01:29:36,457 --> 01:29:39,597
(Did they finally find it?)

2357
01:29:39,927 --> 01:29:42,097
- Do they have it? - Is it this?

2358
01:29:42,097 --> 01:29:43,697
(Is this the stinky tofu they've been searching for?)

2359
01:29:43,697 --> 01:29:46,397
- It's a skewer. - No, that doesn't count.

2360
01:29:46,397 --> 01:29:47,557
(That doesn't qualify.)

2361
01:29:47,557 --> 01:29:48,897
Thank you.

2362
01:29:49,097 --> 01:29:50,757
It's really hard to find stinky tofu.

2363
01:29:50,757 --> 01:29:53,627
- Finding stinky tofu isn't easy. - Right.

2364
01:29:55,457 --> 01:29:57,657
I feel like this place will sell stinky tofu.

2365
01:29:58,027 --> 01:29:59,027
Excuse me.

2366
01:29:59,027 --> 01:30:00,027
(Please be here.)

2367
01:30:00,757 --> 01:30:03,497
- You have the best pronunciation. - Okay.

2368
01:30:04,797 --> 01:30:06,327
Excuse me.

2369
01:30:07,827 --> 01:30:11,197
(Do you guys sell stinky tofu?)

2370
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:12,757
(Yes, we sell it.)

2371
01:30:12,757 --> 01:30:14,197
- Do they have it? - Stinky tofu?

2372
01:30:14,197 --> 01:30:15,557
(Do they really have it?)

2373
01:30:15,557 --> 01:30:17,197
Okay, thank you.

2374
01:30:17,297 --> 01:30:19,697
- Where should we sit? - This place is nice.

2375
01:30:19,727 --> 01:30:21,157
It looks yummy.

2376
01:30:21,257 --> 01:30:23,997
If we even succeed with stinky tofu,

2377
01:30:23,997 --> 01:30:25,357
- that'll be beautiful. - This is...

2378
01:30:25,557 --> 01:30:28,127
Because your team leader, Ji Hyo, peeled off...

2379
01:30:28,127 --> 01:30:31,297
the most pumpkin seeds earlier,

2380
01:30:31,827 --> 01:30:34,427
- you guys won a Chance Card. - That's right.

2381
01:30:34,497 --> 01:30:37,797
We will give you guys the Chance Card right now.

2382
01:30:37,797 --> 01:30:40,197
- Right now? - My goodness.

2383
01:30:40,297 --> 01:30:41,497
Can we open it?

2384
01:30:41,497 --> 01:30:42,657
(What could it be?)

2385
01:30:42,657 --> 01:30:44,757
- What is this? - You can use this card...

2386
01:30:46,227 --> 01:30:48,027
against the other teams.

2387
01:30:48,427 --> 01:30:49,927
(What is it?)

2388
01:30:49,927 --> 01:30:51,757
We can use this against them?

2389
01:30:52,457 --> 01:30:53,597
This is incredible.

2390
01:30:53,597 --> 01:30:56,857
- We're so lucky. - I can't believe our luck.

2391
01:30:56,857 --> 01:31:00,027
You guys can choose one team...

2392
01:31:00,497 --> 01:31:02,397
and use this card against that team.

2393
01:31:02,497 --> 01:31:05,997
Which team will you attack?

2394
01:31:05,997 --> 01:31:08,997
- We don't even need time to think. - Let's just choose.

2395
01:31:08,997 --> 01:31:11,927
Please tell us the team you've chosen. In 1, 2, 3.

2396
01:31:11,927 --> 01:31:13,497
- Osaka. - Osaka.

2397
01:31:13,657 --> 01:31:15,597
You've used your card against Team Osaka.

2398
01:31:15,597 --> 01:31:18,857
- Did we just use it? - Did we use the card?

2399
01:31:18,857 --> 01:31:21,757
- I wonder how they'll react. - I wonder.

2400
01:31:21,757 --> 01:31:22,997
I wonder.

2401
01:31:25,857 --> 01:31:27,027
- Thank you. - I feel great.

2402
01:31:27,357 --> 01:31:30,657
(They've finished taking a bath without knowing what's going on.)

2403
01:31:31,557 --> 01:31:33,497
I was in a rush, so I didn't even put lotion on.

2404
01:31:33,497 --> 01:31:35,827
- So Min. - I didn't get to put lotion on.

2405
01:31:35,827 --> 01:31:36,827
(Is that you, So Min?)

2406
01:31:37,227 --> 01:31:39,757
You look so clean. Do you want to borrow our lotion?

2407
01:31:39,757 --> 01:31:43,097
- I have one. My face is bare. - Do you have one?

2408
01:31:43,627 --> 01:31:45,297
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2409
01:31:45,297 --> 01:31:46,497
Thank you.

2410
01:31:47,097 --> 01:31:49,597
Wait. Where's So Min?

2411
01:31:49,597 --> 01:31:51,927
Where's So Min? Where are your eyebrows?

2412
01:31:51,927 --> 01:31:53,857
(She doesn't look familiar.)

2413
01:31:53,857 --> 01:31:56,557
I'm going to put makeup on now.

2414
01:31:56,857 --> 01:31:58,597
- Really? - You don't need to put makeup on.

2415
01:31:58,597 --> 01:32:01,357
- Let me see your face. - It's better to see her like this.

2416
01:32:01,357 --> 01:32:03,357
- You don't need to put makeup on. - Everyone.

2417
01:32:03,357 --> 01:32:06,357
You've succeeded in finding...

2418
01:32:06,357 --> 01:32:09,357
- Suzuki's bathhouse. - Yes, we did.

2419
01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:12,127
- You've completed your mission. - Yes!

2420
01:32:12,127 --> 01:32:15,257
- It was really nice. - I loved it.

2421
01:32:15,257 --> 01:32:18,357
- I wanted to stay here longer. - Me too.

2422
01:32:18,357 --> 01:32:20,657
- I really liked this place. - Me too. It was so cute.

2423
01:32:20,727 --> 01:32:22,927
- It was also very clean. - It really was.

2424
01:32:22,927 --> 01:32:24,257
However,

2425
01:32:25,427 --> 01:32:28,797
Ji Hyo received a Chance Card earlier. Do you remember that?

2426
01:32:28,797 --> 01:32:29,797
Yes.

2427
01:32:29,797 --> 01:32:30,797
(Team Taipei has attacked Team Osaka.)

2428
01:32:30,857 --> 01:32:31,997
That card...

2429
01:32:31,997 --> 01:32:33,357
(What kind of effect will it have on Team Osaka?)

2430
01:32:33,357 --> 01:32:35,057
- Will have an effect on your team. - What?

2431
01:32:35,197 --> 01:32:37,857
(Team Osaka has cleared their mission,)

2432
01:32:37,857 --> 01:32:39,197
(but they will now be facing hardships.)

2433
01:32:39,197 --> 01:32:41,197
- On our team? - Ji Hyo's team...

2434
01:32:41,197 --> 01:32:43,297
used that card against your team.

2435
01:32:43,557 --> 01:32:45,927
- They're unbelievable. - What is...

2436
01:32:45,927 --> 01:32:47,297
- wrong with them? - Why are they doing this?

2437
01:32:47,297 --> 01:32:49,497
So that's why we were given such a nice meal.

2438
01:32:49,497 --> 01:32:51,157
I guess so.

2440
01:32:54,427 --> 01:32:56,827
(The three teams are not done with their missions yet.)

2441
01:32:56,827 --> 01:32:59,657
(What will be the result?)

2442
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:00,657
(Also,)

2444
01:33:04,497 --> 01:33:06,097
(One single dice...)

2445
01:33:06,097 --> 01:33:09,997
(will decide on their future destiny.)

2446
01:33:09,997 --> 01:33:11,897
(Where will they end up going?)
