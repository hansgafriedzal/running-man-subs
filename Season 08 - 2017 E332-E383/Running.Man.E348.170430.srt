11
00:00:34,586 --> 00:00:36,226
(And)

12
00:00:36,926 --> 00:00:40,586
(Last week, they played Running Marble for their dangerous trip.)

13
00:00:40,586 --> 00:00:43,126
(Before they knew it, their one-day trip around the world began.)

14
00:00:43,686 --> 00:00:47,926
(They had no plans or preparations and went to the airport with a bag.)

15
00:00:48,426 --> 00:00:50,926
(They arrived at the airport at 7:30am. Is it really happening?)

16
00:00:51,386 --> 00:00:53,256
(3 hours later)

17

(Do Yeon's team arrived in Jeju Island.)

20
00:01:02,556 --> 00:01:04,056
(However)

21
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:07,126
(They can't see further than their nose. Can they finish the mission?)

00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:09,556
(Team Taipei has to complete eating five dishes.)

23
00:01:09,556 --> 00:01:11,656

24
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:15,056
(In the center of Osaka, they are looking for Suzuki.)

25
00:01:15,356 --> 00:01:17,026
Where did So Min go? Where is So Min?

26
00:01:17,556 --> 00:01:20,226
(In the center of Osaka, they are screaming So Min's name.)

27
00:01:21,326 --> 00:01:24,056
Jae Seok is like a valley.

28
00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:25,386
It's not deep.

29
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:27,456
It keeps on trickling with water.

30
00:01:27,656 --> 00:01:30,686
(Team Osaka is in chaos as they are trapped in So Min's conversations.)

31
00:01:30,686 --> 00:01:33,526
(She is shy to be in front of the cameras. She's a new crazy member.)

32
00:01:34,686 --> 00:01:37,226
(She doesn't care about the mission and is filming a movie alone.)

33
00:01:37,986 --> 00:01:42,156
(Team Osaka's hidden mission is to analyse So Min's personality.)

34
00:01:42,226 --> 00:01:44,426
- We found it. - That bathhouse is it.

35
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:47,226
(After many obstacles, they found a bathhouse run by Suzuki.)

36
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:51,026
(They accomplished their mission. Can they return safely to Korea?)

37
00:01:51,526 --> 00:01:53,456
(Team Osaka, stop right there!)

38
00:01:53,456 --> 00:01:56,156
(Team Taipei is pursuing Team Osaka with a voracious appetite.)

39
00:01:56,156 --> 00:01:57,686
Stinky tofu dish?

40
00:01:57,686 --> 00:02:00,226
(They are on the move to find a stinky tofu dish.)

41
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:04,656
(Will Team Taipei be able to find a stinky tofu dish?)

42
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:10,886
Since the team leader, Ji Hyo peeled off the most pumpkin seeds earlier,

43
00:02:11,456 --> 00:02:13,756
- you guys won a Chance Card. - That's right.

44
00:02:13,956 --> 00:02:16,186
We will give you guys the Chance Card right now.

45
00:02:16,186 --> 00:02:18,686
- Right now? - My goodness.

46
00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:21,026
(Team Taipei has the Chance Card in their hands at last.)

47
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:23,756
(It's a hidden weapon that will change the game completely.)

48
00:02:23,756 --> 00:02:25,796
- What is this? - You can use this card...

49
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:27,556
against the other teams to...

50
00:02:29,556 --> 00:02:31,356
We can use this against them?

51
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:34,296
(The secret of this Chance Card will be revealed right now.)

52
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:37,256
(Team Taipei doesn't hesitate...)

53
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:38,686
(to use this on Team Osaka.)

54
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:42,656
(Meanwhile, Team Osaka enjoyed their bath.)

55
00:02:44,226 --> 00:02:45,386
- Gosh, this is refreshing. - Nice.

56
00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:46,656
(They had a wash and brush up.)

57
00:02:49,956 --> 00:02:51,926
I was in a rush, so I didn't even put lotion on.

58
00:02:51,926 --> 00:02:54,286
- So Min. - I didn't get to put lotion on.

59
00:02:54,286 --> 00:02:55,656
(You washed thoroughly.)

60
00:02:55,656 --> 00:02:58,286
You look so clean. Do you want to borrow our lotion?

61
00:02:58,286 --> 00:03:01,656
- I have one. My face is bare. - Do you have one?

62
00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:03,956
- Thank you. - Thank you.

63
00:03:03,956 --> 00:03:05,786
(Thank you, Mr. Suzuki.)

64
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,456
Wait. Where's So Min?

65
00:03:07,456 --> 00:03:09,386
(When will So Min be out?)

66
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:10,526
Where are your eyebrows?

67
00:03:11,286 --> 00:03:13,986
I'm going to put makeup on now.

68
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:16,056
- Really? - You don't have to put makeup on.

69
00:03:16,056 --> 00:03:17,126
Let me see your face.

70
00:03:17,126 --> 00:03:19,856
- It's better to see you like this. - You don't have to put makeup on.

71
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:23,856
Everyone. You've succeeded in finding Suzuki's bathhouse even...

72
00:03:23,856 --> 00:03:27,186
- though the mission was difficult. - Yes, we did.

73
00:03:27,186 --> 00:03:29,656
- You've completed your mission. - Yes!

74
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:30,756
(Team Osaka accomplished their mission.)

75
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:33,656
- It was really nice. - I loved it.

76
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:36,956
- I wanted to stay longer. - Me too.

77
00:03:36,956 --> 00:03:39,156
- I really liked this kind of place. - Me too. It was so cute.

78
00:03:39,156 --> 00:03:41,426
- It was also very clean. - It really was.

79
00:03:41,426 --> 00:03:42,556
However...

80
00:03:43,786 --> 00:03:44,786
However...

81
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:46,586
(They get a bad feeling right away.)

82
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:49,856
Ji Hyo received a Chance Card earlier. Do you remember that?

83
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:51,856
(They had forgotten about the card.)

84
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,956
The Chance Card was Doubling Card.

85
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:56,126
- Okay. - What is that?

86
00:03:56,126 --> 00:03:59,786
The team which the card was used on has to do another mission.

87
00:04:00,456 --> 00:04:02,286
(Why are you telling us that?)

88
00:04:02,426 --> 00:04:05,456
Ji Hyo used that card against Team Osaka.

89
00:04:05,586 --> 00:04:07,926
- They are unbelievable. - What is...

90
00:04:07,926 --> 00:04:09,356
- wrong with them? - Why are they doing this?

91
00:04:09,356 --> 00:04:11,756
That's why they took time enjoying their meal.

92
00:04:11,756 --> 00:04:13,026
I guess so.

93
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:16,056
Look at us. We are completely ready to go home.

94
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:18,596
- I don't look presentable for TV. - We had a nice meal.

95
00:04:18,596 --> 00:04:20,056
- We even had snacks. - He washed his hair...

96
00:04:20,056 --> 00:04:21,456
with cleansing foam.

97
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:22,926
My hair is so dry right now.

98
00:04:22,926 --> 00:04:25,026
Don't I look like I came from hiking?

99
00:04:25,326 --> 00:04:26,486
- Gosh. - You...

100
00:04:26,486 --> 00:04:28,596
- You don't have time. Let's hurry. - What is the mission?

101
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:32,686
The mission is to get a trendy Japanese hairstyle.

102
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:36,056
(Japanese hairstyle?)

103
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:38,526
(Japanese hairstyle?)

104
00:04:38,686 --> 00:04:42,026
(Welcome to the world of style.)

105
00:04:42,926 --> 00:04:44,826
- We don't have much time. - Do we have time for that?

106
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,126
We need to leave soon. Where is a hair salon?

107
00:04:47,126 --> 00:04:48,926
We could have gone to a barbershop, but it's closed.

108
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:50,256
It's closed.

109
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:53,226
Let's go to a shopping mall...

110
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,426
- and see if there is a hair salon. - We won't find anything here.

111
00:04:55,926 --> 00:04:58,556
- This is harsh. - What do you mean?

112
00:04:58,556 --> 00:05:00,126
I thought we were done with the mission.

113
00:05:00,126 --> 00:05:02,156
- You pronounced it wrong again. - I know.

114
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,126
How else am I supposed to pronounce it?

115
00:05:04,126 --> 00:05:05,226
- "Mission". - "Mission".

116
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:06,926
Mission.

117
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:11,456
(It's So Min's mission to learn how to pronounce it.)

118
00:05:11,826 --> 00:05:12,856
Mission.

119
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:14,386
- Wait a minute. - Let's have something to drink.

120
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:15,756
- Shall we get beverages? - Yes.

121
00:05:15,756 --> 00:05:18,186
- Who wants something to drink? - Let's get green tea.

122
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:19,486
- Green tea. - Okay.

123
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,326
This tour is very homely and nice.

124
00:05:22,326 --> 00:05:24,986
- I feel like I am playing house. - Get green tea.

125
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:28,686
- It's cheaper than it is in Korea. - Let's get one more bottle.

126
00:05:28,686 --> 00:05:31,326
Wait a minute. In that case, give me green tea as well.

127
00:05:33,586 --> 00:05:34,726
Why won't it come out?

128
00:05:34,926 --> 00:05:36,656
Did you insert the coins wrong?

129
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:39,086
- The machine ate the coins. - I inserted them.

130
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:41,026
- I inserted them. - The machine ate the coins.

131
00:05:41,026 --> 00:05:42,086
I inserted them.

132
00:05:43,626 --> 00:05:45,186
This is...

133
00:05:45,786 --> 00:05:47,556
- It came out. - Vending machines are the same.

134
00:05:47,826 --> 00:05:50,786
- Vending machines are the same. - It came out.

135
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:53,756
(Vending machines are the same everywhere around the world.)

136
00:05:55,086 --> 00:05:56,426
Okay.

137
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,286
This is a tour in Japan.

138
00:05:58,286 --> 00:05:59,826
(He is excited.)

139
00:06:00,286 --> 00:06:02,256
- Put some lotion on your face. - Suddenly...

140
00:06:02,656 --> 00:06:04,986
- Your face... - I'm feeling good all of a sudden.

141
00:06:04,986 --> 00:06:06,756
- Seok Jin's face is too dry. - Let's drink...

142
00:06:06,756 --> 00:06:08,256
cool green tea.

143
00:06:08,256 --> 00:06:10,326
Seok Jin's face is like a dry rice paddy.

144
00:06:10,986 --> 00:06:13,656
- A dry rice paddy. - This is a tour in Japan.

145
00:06:13,656 --> 00:06:15,986
- Did you apply lotion? - Yes, I did. Why do you ask?

146
00:06:15,986 --> 00:06:17,156
- Do I look weird? - What are you doing?

147
00:06:17,756 --> 00:06:19,126
- I am putting makeup on. - Do it thoroughly.

148
00:06:19,126 --> 00:06:20,486
How does my face look?

149
00:06:20,986 --> 00:06:22,926
- Is it flushed? - It looks like a dry rice paddy.

150
00:06:22,926 --> 00:06:24,256
(She applies makeup in front of the camera.)

151
00:06:24,856 --> 00:06:26,226
Please show me how I look on the camera.

152
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:28,256
(Staring)

153
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:29,886
- I cleansed my face. - You look fine.

154
00:06:30,826 --> 00:06:32,326
Let's get in the car.

155
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:35,586
(They go to the center of the city in search of a hair salon.)

156
00:06:35,586 --> 00:06:37,126
It would have been nice if the barbershop was open.

157
00:06:37,556 --> 00:06:40,286
Then we could have left after getting our hair done.

158
00:06:41,456 --> 00:06:42,786
We still have 30km left to go.

159
00:06:43,226 --> 00:06:46,026
Will we be able to complete the mission?

160
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:47,426
(What will be the fate of Team Osaka?)

161
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:50,356
(Meanwhile, in Taiwan...)

162
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:52,886
(Team Taipei entered the stinky tofu restaurant.)

163
00:06:52,886 --> 00:06:54,986
Thank you. Thank you.

164
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:57,926
- The atmosphere is nice. - I bet the dishes are delicious.

165
00:06:58,186 --> 00:07:02,026
We won't have any problems if we succeed in eating stinky tofu.

166
00:07:02,826 --> 00:07:04,956
- Here is the menu. - It looks nice.

167
00:07:04,956 --> 00:07:06,956
It says it's spicy. "Duck".

168
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:09,286
"Spicy duck"...

169
00:07:09,286 --> 00:07:11,586
- This is seonji. Seonji. - Blood?

170
00:07:11,726 --> 00:07:14,526
"Tofu". It says "stinky tofu".

171
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:15,826
(That sounds intense.)

172
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:18,156
(Nervous)

173
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:24,126
(Stinky tofu is made with tofu that is salted and fermented.)

174
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:27,786
(It's hard to enjoy the dish because of its strong smell.)

175
00:07:28,026 --> 00:07:30,186
(The stinky tofu dish is served.)

176
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,886
(What is this smell?)

177
00:07:35,886 --> 00:07:37,426
It looks like it would be difficult to eat.

178
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:39,226
(They are lost for words.)

179
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,386
(What should we eat first?)

180
00:07:44,286 --> 00:07:46,586
Tell yourself that it smells like hot pot.

181
00:07:46,586 --> 00:07:47,786
- It smells like hot pot. - It does.

182
00:07:48,756 --> 00:07:51,086
- Let's try the dish. - Shall we try the soup first?

183
00:07:51,756 --> 00:07:52,886
Stay positive.

184
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:55,626
(How does the soup of duck blood and stinky tofu taste?)

185
00:07:57,126 --> 00:07:59,226
- It's tasty. - It's delicious!

186
00:07:59,456 --> 00:08:00,686
This is duck blood.

187
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:03,056
(She tries duck blood this time.)

188
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:08,026
- It tastes like seonji. - Seonji?

189
00:08:08,826 --> 00:08:10,756
Ji Hyo is incredible.

190
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,356
She is Big Mama of variety shows.

191
00:08:14,756 --> 00:08:15,956
She is like Lee Hye Jung.

192
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:18,556
- This is stinky tofu, right? - This is stinky tofu.

193
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:20,126
I am serious.

194
00:08:20,856 --> 00:08:22,026
It smells a bit.

195
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:25,686
- Wait a minute. It smells a bit. - Ji Hyo, what is up with you?

196
00:08:27,686 --> 00:08:30,556
(Chewing)

197
00:08:32,256 --> 00:08:34,086
(She puts down the chopsticks.)

198
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:36,856
- The smell isn't too strong, is it? - It isn't too strong.

199
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:39,426
(Even Ji Hyo gave up on eating this dish.)

200
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:43,456
Try it. It tastes like tofu that tastes slightly strange.

201
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:47,826
Stay positive.

202
00:08:48,256 --> 00:08:50,026
(Chewing)

203
00:08:50,526 --> 00:08:51,586
It's okay.

204
00:08:52,526 --> 00:08:53,626
(Staying positive makes him strong.)

205
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:55,286
(Your face tells me otherwise.)

206
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:56,826
You aren't breathing.

207
00:08:56,826 --> 00:08:58,826
- The power of positivity! - "It's okay."

208
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:00,586
Let's eat a dumpling each.

209
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:02,126
- That's a good idea. - Let's eat a dumpling each.

210
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:03,886
Let's soothe our stomach first.

211
00:09:04,786 --> 00:09:07,086
The dumpling wrapper...

212
00:09:07,086 --> 00:09:09,056
is thicker than it is in Korea.

213
00:09:10,056 --> 00:09:11,326
(Putting something on the top)

214
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,586
(Here is stinky tofu for you.)

215
00:09:17,286 --> 00:09:19,956
(Don't be picky with your food, Haha.)

216
00:09:21,456 --> 00:09:22,626
Eat it with stinky tofu on the top.

217
00:09:22,626 --> 00:09:25,256
Ji Hyo is working hard today.

218
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:26,786
Okay.

219
00:09:26,786 --> 00:09:28,786
(Haha tries stinky tofu thanks to Ji Hyo.)

220
00:09:31,356 --> 00:09:32,456
It's okay, right?

221
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:36,156
Does the juice of dumpling conceal the smell of stinky tofu?

222
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:37,986
Do you taste the dishes separately?

223
00:09:37,986 --> 00:09:39,256
I taste the dishes separately.

224
00:09:39,256 --> 00:09:40,886
(It doesn't conceal anything.)

225
00:09:42,356 --> 00:09:44,256
Then there is no point in eating them together.

226
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:46,956
- It's delicious. - Is it okay to eat it that way?

227
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:52,226
- Foreigners hate cheonggukjang. - This is the same thing.

228
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:54,326
The more you eat cheonggukjang, the more charming its taste becomes.

229
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:56,886
I know. You fall in love with its savoury taste.

230
00:09:56,886 --> 00:09:59,486
I want to fall into the charms of stinky tofu.

231
00:09:59,986 --> 00:10:01,786
- Try another bite. - You should go first.

232
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:04,456
You should fall into its charms first.

233
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:07,256
- Since there is a piece... - Let's have one person eat it.

234
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:08,696
Let's get rid of it that way.

235
00:10:08,696 --> 00:10:09,856
After you eat it,

236
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:14,156
you can't drink soda. Swallow and stick out your tongue.

237
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,086
- After that, you can eat dumplings. - Okay.

238
00:10:16,696 --> 00:10:17,856
Here comes the roulette.

239
00:10:18,026 --> 00:10:19,926
(The roulette appears.)

240
00:10:19,926 --> 00:10:21,026
I have an idea.

241
00:10:21,026 --> 00:10:23,156
- 1st place gets 3 slots. - 1st place gets 3 slots.

242
00:10:23,326 --> 00:10:25,286
- 2nd place gets 5 slots. - Then there will be a slot left.

243
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:26,786
Last place gets eight slots.

244
00:10:26,786 --> 00:10:28,386
Even if we do that, we won't know...

245
00:10:28,386 --> 00:10:29,886
- who will get chosen. - That's right.

246
00:10:30,286 --> 00:10:32,126
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

247
00:10:32,886 --> 00:10:35,286
(Haha gets 8 slots.)

248
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:37,026
Haha is unlucky today.

249
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:39,196
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

250
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:41,086
(Se Chan won.)

251
00:10:41,356 --> 00:10:43,656
- Nice! I am lucky today. - He is lucky.

252
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:45,026
I am lucky today.

253
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:47,196
You are the ones who came up with the rules.

254
00:10:47,456 --> 00:10:51,126
You have to chew the tofu without soda...

255
00:10:51,386 --> 00:10:53,626
or dumplings before you finish it and stick out your tongue.

256
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:56,786
Who will spin it? Will the producer do it?

257
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:58,326
- Let's have the producer spin it. - Okay.

258
00:10:58,326 --> 00:11:00,026
Otherwise, we might resent each other.

259
00:11:00,456 --> 00:11:02,386
In 1, 2, 3.

260
00:11:03,256 --> 00:11:06,656
(Stinky tofu dish has rich history and nutrients.)

261
00:11:06,656 --> 00:11:10,426
(Who will get to enjoy the precious taste?)

262
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:13,756
(Stinky tofu dish is ready to show its charms.)

263
00:11:14,826 --> 00:11:17,086
(What will be the result?)

264
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:20,256
(Congratulations, Se Chan.)

265
00:11:21,726 --> 00:11:24,586
(This is incredible.)

266
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:27,456
(Is this for real?)

267
00:11:29,686 --> 00:11:30,756
(He defied the probability.)

268
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,356
His luck is like super poop.

269
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,986
He is the unluckiest.

270
00:11:36,356 --> 00:11:38,286
(What have I done wrong?)

271
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:42,256
(I won the game of rock-paper-scissors.)

272
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:46,126
(Haha was supposed to be the one.)

273
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:49,086
I have 3 slots. Don't you have 8 slots?

274
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:52,486
(Start eating.)

275
00:11:53,356 --> 00:11:55,526
(He starts eating the sticky tofu.)

276
00:11:57,026 --> 00:11:58,486
Stay positive.

277
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,286
Stay positive. It will be tasty.

278
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,586
Please make this match come true.

279
00:12:02,986 --> 00:12:05,326
- Yang Se Chan versus Lee Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

280
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:09,556
It will be a match of the century. It's like Batman versus Superman.

281
00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:10,686
He is right.

282
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:12,326
Who do you think will win?

283
00:12:12,326 --> 00:12:14,226
- The recent events say Se Chan. - Right?

284
00:12:14,226 --> 00:12:17,126
- He is terribly unlucky. - Go, Se Chan.

285
00:12:17,126 --> 00:12:18,826
I can drink soda after I stick out my tongue, right?

286
00:12:18,826 --> 00:12:19,926
Yes.

287
00:12:19,926 --> 00:12:21,156
(He puts stinky tofu in his mouth.)

288
00:12:22,026 --> 00:12:23,426
(Chewing)

289
00:12:27,256 --> 00:12:29,786
(Did the charm of stinky tofu touch you?)

290
00:12:29,786 --> 00:12:31,186
(Grabbing)

291
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:34,456
Think of your mom.

292
00:12:34,456 --> 00:12:37,556
(My mom and my brother were so happy when I joined Running Man.)

293
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,126
Think about the hard times.

294
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,826
Hang in there.

295
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:44,326
(Se Chan, stay positive.)

296
00:12:45,026 --> 00:12:46,156
He is incredible.

297
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:48,526
I stuck out my tongue.

298
00:12:50,556 --> 00:12:52,886
(Se Chan succeeded in eating stinky tofu in one bite.)

299
00:12:52,886 --> 00:12:53,926
I respect you.

300
00:12:54,986 --> 00:12:56,026
I totally respect you.

301
00:12:56,856 --> 00:12:59,986
It felt like I was eating Do Yeon's foot.

302
00:13:00,756 --> 00:13:02,556
It felt like I was eating Do Yeon's foot.

303
00:13:03,286 --> 00:13:06,156
(The woman with charms of stinky tofu is in Jeju Island.)

304
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:07,756
- Thank you. Thank you. - Thank you.

305
00:13:08,426 --> 00:13:09,456
Thank you.

306
00:13:09,726 --> 00:13:12,086
(They leave for a mission of eating octopus ramyeon.)

307
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:14,686
- Let's go. - He won't be able to hear us well.

308
00:13:14,686 --> 00:13:16,086
(Come closer, Kwang Soo.)

309
00:13:17,126 --> 00:13:18,986
- Hold our hands. - I mean...

310
00:13:19,486 --> 00:13:22,026
Hold our hands.

311
00:13:23,456 --> 00:13:25,226
- Slide in. - Well...

312
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:28,626
Do it like you are slipping on sea water.

313
00:13:29,356 --> 00:13:31,756
(Depressed)

314
00:13:31,756 --> 00:13:33,926
(This isn't Jeju Island we dreamed of.)

315
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:35,386
My hands and feet are numb.

316
00:13:37,386 --> 00:13:38,526
Who is that?

317
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,586
(Who is calling me?)

318
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:42,186
Ji Hyo video called me earlier.

319
00:13:42,926 --> 00:13:43,956
I didn't answer.

320
00:13:45,256 --> 00:13:46,786
Why did my sister call me?

321
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:52,026
My sister called...

322
00:13:53,756 --> 00:13:56,086
to show her child, but I can't answer the call.

323
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,426
(My sister called to show her child, but I can't answer the call.)

324
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,986
- It's heartbreaking, right? - Take off the head part.

325
00:14:01,986 --> 00:14:03,026
(She feels bad.)

326
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:05,986
(I am sorry. Uncle is working hard.)

327
00:14:05,986 --> 00:14:09,126
The fabric must be very tough. I can't see the outline of his ears.

328
00:14:10,826 --> 00:14:14,156
- I have big ears too. - His ears are missing.

329
00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:16,156
- Do you have big ears? - His ears are missing.

330
00:14:16,386 --> 00:14:17,626
- That's hilarious. - Why are his ears missing?

331
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:18,686
Jong Kook.

332
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:21,326
Didn't you force me to wear the cap and goggles?

333
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,126
(Give him the cap and goggles.)

334
00:14:25,126 --> 00:14:26,356
(Is there a cap?)

335
00:14:26,526 --> 00:14:27,656
That'd complete the outfit.

336
00:14:27,726 --> 00:14:30,156
(He is very kind in moments like this one.)

337
00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:32,626
(Laughing)

338
00:14:33,056 --> 00:14:35,186
I was perfectly fine before you interfered.

339
00:14:35,386 --> 00:14:38,086
- This is how women divers look. - You're right.

340
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,186
You looked too good before putting on the cap.

341
00:14:40,186 --> 00:14:41,186
Exactly.

342
00:14:41,186 --> 00:14:43,226
Every time I look at him... Gosh, look at him.

343
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:46,626
(Ridiculous)

344
00:14:46,626 --> 00:14:48,126
(Where...)

345
00:14:48,126 --> 00:14:50,186
(did it all go wrong?)

346
00:14:51,656 --> 00:14:54,326
Before it gets colder...

347
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,186
We haven't eaten anything since 1pm.

348
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,386
I'm so hungry.

349
00:14:57,386 --> 00:14:59,156
- We even went into the water. - Let's eat something.

350
00:14:59,156 --> 00:15:00,786
Jeju Island is famous for...

351
00:15:01,286 --> 00:15:03,626
- omegi rice cakes. - Omegi rice cakes?

352
00:15:03,626 --> 00:15:06,486
There's a rice cake shop. Should we buy some?

353
00:15:06,486 --> 00:15:07,686
- Should we do that? - Should we try?

354
00:15:07,886 --> 00:15:09,756
(They're finally getting something to eat.)

355
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:12,126
What's going on? Are they out of business?

356
00:15:12,986 --> 00:15:15,326
(Is no one here?)

357
00:15:15,326 --> 00:15:17,556
- Are we breaking in? - Excuse... Is this a private home?

358
00:15:17,556 --> 00:15:18,626
Isn't this omegi rice cakes?

359
00:15:19,026 --> 00:15:20,426
Excuse me.

360
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:24,156
- Look at this. - Excuse me.

361
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,386
(What is this creepy-looking rice cakes?)

362
00:15:25,586 --> 00:15:28,026
- Excuse me. - Hello.

363
00:15:29,156 --> 00:15:31,386
We'd like to buy some rice cakes.

364
00:15:34,126 --> 00:15:36,926
- Is this a prank? - It reminds me of "The Chaser".

365
00:15:37,226 --> 00:15:39,156
It looks so old.

366
00:15:39,156 --> 00:15:40,726
(The rice cakes look mysterious.)

367
00:15:40,726 --> 00:15:41,886
It's green.

368
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:44,526
Excuse me.

369
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,326
Should we report?

370
00:15:46,326 --> 00:15:47,456
Excuse me.

371
00:15:48,026 --> 00:15:51,326
(But they could find no one in there.)

372
00:15:53,356 --> 00:15:55,656
Why is it so hard... Why are we so unlucky today?

373
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:56,856
My goodness.

374
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:59,386
Why is it so hard to have a little rice cakes?

375
00:15:59,386 --> 00:16:01,286
(Team Jeju Island's misfortune continues.)

376
00:16:01,756 --> 00:16:03,826
(They had to buy donuts at a bakery instead.)

377
00:16:03,826 --> 00:16:05,126
- Did you buy something? - Yes.

378
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,656
(I've been so hungry.)

379
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:14,956
(Something is wrong again.)

380
00:16:14,956 --> 00:16:16,286
I don't believe you.

381
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:18,856
Usually, fresh donuts taste good.

382
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:21,126
(Laughing)

383
00:16:21,126 --> 00:16:23,126
Seriously? What's going on today?

384
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:25,756
You can't expect everything to taste good.

385
00:16:26,726 --> 00:16:28,656
- What do you think? - Be honest.

386
00:16:28,886 --> 00:16:30,026
It makes me thirsty.

387
00:16:30,026 --> 00:16:31,856
- I know. - My throat hurts.

388
00:16:32,026 --> 00:16:34,226
It's so dry.

389
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:36,786
It absorbed all the moisture...

390
00:16:36,786 --> 00:16:38,226
- in my body. - Exactly.

391
00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:39,886
I've never been this thirsty since my military training.

392
00:16:39,886 --> 00:16:41,786
Seriously.

393
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:44,886
(So far, they've been able to laugh it off.)

394
00:16:44,886 --> 00:16:46,156
Here.

395
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:50,326
- We got another bad news. - What is it?

396
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:53,586
We booked flight tickets this morning, right?

397
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:55,556
The teams were decided this morning.

398
00:16:55,826 --> 00:16:58,956
We're trying to book our return tickets right now.

399
00:16:59,656 --> 00:17:01,726
- But it's not going so well. - No way.

400
00:17:01,726 --> 00:17:02,726
No way.

401
00:17:02,726 --> 00:17:04,396
Kwang Soo and Jong Kook's flight...

402
00:17:04,396 --> 00:17:06,186
departs at 5pm.

403
00:17:06,186 --> 00:17:07,856
(Kwang Soo and Jong Kook's flight departs at 5pm.)

404
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:10,396
Kwang Soo and Jong Kook's flight departs at 5pm.

405
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,396
(So soon?)

406
00:17:11,586 --> 00:17:13,126
- We should hurry. - Really?

407
00:17:13,126 --> 00:17:15,086
Do Yeon's flight...

408
00:17:15,086 --> 00:17:16,286
departs at 8pm.

409
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,926
What am I supposed to do here alone for three hours?

410
00:17:17,926 --> 00:17:20,486
There are no available tickets for the rest of the staff.

411
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:21,726
Really?

412
00:17:22,226 --> 00:17:25,126
(Jeju Island has been harsh on them.)

413
00:17:26,026 --> 00:17:28,656
(They head for the airport without having octopus ramyeon.)

414
00:17:29,486 --> 00:17:31,956
(Kwang Soo and Jong Kook have to get on the flight.)

415
00:17:31,956 --> 00:17:33,656
Put on the goggles.

416
00:17:33,956 --> 00:17:36,356
(They have to get on the plane within 10 minutes.)

417
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:41,086
(All they did in Jeju Island was struggle.)

418
00:17:41,086 --> 00:17:44,186
(Will Do Yeon be all right?)

419
00:17:44,726 --> 00:17:46,086
Gosh, it's cold.

420
00:17:46,826 --> 00:17:49,126
(What will happen to us?)

421
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,186
(Meanwhile, what is Team Taipei doing?)

422
00:17:52,756 --> 00:17:55,286
It feels like we're backpackers.

423
00:17:55,396 --> 00:17:56,526
You're right.

424
00:17:56,586 --> 00:17:57,726
We're backpackers.

425
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,756
- We are. - Our backpacks are pretty too.

426
00:17:59,826 --> 00:18:00,956
- You're right. - They have nice colours.

427
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,326
They're red, yellow, and green.

428
00:18:02,326 --> 00:18:03,356
(They look like traffic lights.)

429
00:18:03,356 --> 00:18:05,256
Wait. There's a beef place.

430
00:18:05,456 --> 00:18:06,556
- Where? - There's a cow.

431
00:18:06,556 --> 00:18:07,986
That's right.

432
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:09,926
That's the place.

433
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:11,926
Let's go.

434
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:14,726
- What's this place? - It opened in 1958.

435
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,056
(They found a place with a long history.)

436
00:18:16,056 --> 00:18:17,326
- Jackie Chan was here. - That's right.

437
00:18:17,326 --> 00:18:18,526
- Jackie Chan was here. - Let me see.

438
00:18:18,526 --> 00:18:20,086
Look. It's Jackie Chan.

439
00:18:20,086 --> 00:18:23,256
He appeared on Running Man before too.

440
00:18:23,256 --> 00:18:25,086
(Jackie, is this place good?)

441
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:26,826
- Let's go in. - Let's go.

442
00:18:27,556 --> 00:18:31,626
(Beef noodles, a representative noodle dish of Greater China)

443
00:18:31,626 --> 00:18:36,486
(The broth is made only with beef and has a clear taste.)

444
00:18:36,486 --> 00:18:37,526
I'm excited.

445
00:18:37,526 --> 00:18:39,226
- I think it'll taste good. - I think so too.

446
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:40,896
(The combination of rich beef broth and chewy noodles)

447
00:18:41,756 --> 00:18:42,786
Today...

448
00:18:43,086 --> 00:18:45,226
- To our memorable trip. - Yes.

449
00:18:45,756 --> 00:18:46,896
We must be ahead of the others.

450
00:18:46,896 --> 00:18:49,326
We gave them another mission.

451
00:18:49,326 --> 00:18:50,926
Team Osaka has to complete another mission.

452
00:18:50,926 --> 00:18:52,286
They might be late.

453
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:55,126
Ji Hyo, you did a great job badmouthing other members.

454
00:18:55,126 --> 00:18:56,926
You did a great job.

455
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:58,586
I'm good at badmouthing people.

456
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,686
- We found her talent. - She's good at agreeing too.

457
00:19:02,686 --> 00:19:04,526
If we continue this way,

458
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:06,856
- we'll win. - But we can't relax.

459
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:08,426
There's something Jae Seok said on "X-Man".

460
00:19:08,426 --> 00:19:09,826
- What is it? - We have...

461
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:12,656
safety bread.

462
00:19:12,656 --> 00:19:13,786
What does that mean?

463
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,026
It means we're safe.

464
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:16,786
(We're safe.)

465
00:19:17,186 --> 00:19:19,356
(We know we won't lose for certain.)

466
00:19:19,356 --> 00:19:20,896
We're very safe.

467
00:19:21,456 --> 00:19:23,956
(Beef noodles are served.)

468
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:26,156
It looks so tasty.

469
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:28,126
(It looks and smells tasty.)

470
00:19:28,926 --> 00:19:30,486
(Let me try the soup.)

471
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,896
Please describe the taste well.

472
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:35,586
Try it.

473
00:19:36,396 --> 00:19:37,626
(Slurping)

474
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:42,526
(Impressed)

475
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:46,626
(How can it taste so good?)

476
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:49,626
This is insane.

477
00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:53,326
(Emotional)

478
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:57,626
(He thinks of his mother back home.)

479
00:19:57,626 --> 00:19:58,686
Don't cry.

480
00:19:58,686 --> 00:20:00,556
(The beef broth makes you cry.)

481
00:20:00,556 --> 00:20:02,426
Haha, stop crying. It's okay.

482
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:06,526
(My mother likes beef noodles.)

483
00:20:08,726 --> 00:20:11,686
(Holding back his tears, Haha tries the soup again.)

484
00:20:11,686 --> 00:20:12,956
My gosh.

485
00:20:12,956 --> 00:20:18,226
I think this is the tastiest broth I've ever tasted in my life.

486
00:20:18,396 --> 00:20:20,256
This is the best meat broth I've tasted.

487
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,726
If you eat the noodles with the beef,

488
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,656
it tastes like galbijjim.

489
00:20:25,656 --> 00:20:26,786
Really?

490
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,126
It tastes like galbijjim.

491
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:30,426
(Every bite surprises them.)

492
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:31,626
(Tasting)

493
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:32,986
It's interesting.

494
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:34,056
(Beef noodles tastes interesting.)

495
00:20:34,056 --> 00:20:35,656
The texture is very interesting.

496
00:20:36,186 --> 00:20:37,486
The taste is very interesting.

497
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:41,826
(Is this your first time trying beef noodles?)

498
00:20:41,926 --> 00:20:43,396
It's very interesting.

499
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:48,456
(The taste is unbelievable.)

500
00:20:49,526 --> 00:20:52,356
It tastes so refreshing at the end.

501
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:54,026
I'm so full.

502
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:55,986
(They've emptied their bowls.)

503
00:20:56,826 --> 00:20:58,356
I'm so full.

504
00:20:58,356 --> 00:21:00,656
When you're full,

505
00:21:00,986 --> 00:21:02,396
- you should have dessert. - You're right.

506
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:03,856
(They have to try mango shaved ice and pineapple cake.)

507
00:21:03,856 --> 00:21:05,826
I wish I could do this every day.

508
00:21:07,626 --> 00:21:09,626
- Look. - It's right here.

509
00:21:10,956 --> 00:21:13,056
- Look at that. - It's crazy.

510
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:14,256
(They found a shaved ice place.)

511
00:21:14,686 --> 00:21:16,186
Let's share it.

512
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:19,626
(Mango shaved ice has a sweet and fresh taste.)

513
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:21,256
(They're about to enjoy it now.)

514
00:21:21,256 --> 00:21:22,926
- Ji Hyo. - Oh, my.

515
00:21:23,286 --> 00:21:25,556
- It's here. - I can't believe this.

516
00:21:25,556 --> 00:21:26,896
(It's the perfect time for mango shaved ice.)

517
00:21:26,896 --> 00:21:29,586
- It looks so tasty. - Is that kimchi? What's that?

518
00:21:29,586 --> 00:21:32,056
It looks so luxurious. I don't want to touch it.

519
00:21:32,056 --> 00:21:34,026
- I don't want to crush it. - Let's try.

520
00:21:40,056 --> 00:21:41,456
(All three of them are amazed.)

521
00:21:41,456 --> 00:21:42,786
- It tastes so good. - Taiwan.

522
00:21:42,786 --> 00:21:45,926
It feels like when you go into a bank...

523
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:48,626
to avoid heat on a hot summer day.

524
00:21:48,626 --> 00:21:51,056
It's so cool in the bank.

525
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:52,526
It feels exactly like that.

526
00:21:52,656 --> 00:21:54,286
It feels like I stepped into a bank.

527
00:21:54,986 --> 00:21:57,156
- Good job. - I'm relieved.

528
00:21:57,256 --> 00:21:58,826
It's the best way to describe it.

529
00:22:00,226 --> 00:22:02,926
(I love Taiwan.)

530
00:22:03,586 --> 00:22:05,226
(An arm comes in.)

531
00:22:05,626 --> 00:22:08,756
Our staff members couldn't resist, and they are starting to try it.

532
00:22:09,026 --> 00:22:10,086
It's beautiful.

533
00:22:10,086 --> 00:22:12,086
- It's too hot. - Come here.

534
00:22:13,686 --> 00:22:16,056
Try it. It feels like you're in a bank.

535
00:22:16,056 --> 00:22:17,526
- Right? - It's delicious.

536
00:22:17,926 --> 00:22:19,686
- It tastes so good. - It's tasty.

537
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:21,086
(The bank is crowded.)

538
00:22:22,656 --> 00:22:24,486
We have to get on the plane soon.

539
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:26,226
- We don't have much time. - It was so tasty.

540
00:22:26,226 --> 00:22:28,156
- Let's get souvenirs. - Okay.

541
00:22:28,156 --> 00:22:29,156
- Okay? - I'll...

542
00:22:29,156 --> 00:22:30,656
(Souvenirs?)

543
00:22:31,086 --> 00:22:34,086
You have to get souvenirs for a member...

544
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:37,756
whose name is in your backpack.

545
00:22:39,256 --> 00:22:41,456
What should I get?

546
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:42,786
(They separate to buy souvenirs.)

547
00:22:43,356 --> 00:22:46,586
What should I buy?

548
00:22:47,686 --> 00:22:49,856
I've been thinking,

549
00:22:50,256 --> 00:22:51,456
and I have an idea.

550
00:22:52,356 --> 00:22:53,356
(What kind of souvenirs will they get?)

551
00:22:53,356 --> 00:22:56,756
Once you see it, you'll know whom I'm getting it for.

552
00:22:58,456 --> 00:23:00,586
(Sa Chan finds a pineapple cake store.)

553
00:23:00,886 --> 00:23:02,386
(It's a cake made with pineapple jam.)

554
00:23:02,386 --> 00:23:05,186
- I'll open it for you. - Thank you.

555
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:08,256
I tried one earlier.

556
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:10,556
- You did? - Yes.

557
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:11,786
(It's their fifth food.)

558
00:23:12,886 --> 00:23:15,856
We picked the right dishes.

559
00:23:15,856 --> 00:23:17,686
(It was like a course meal.)

560
00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:19,586
This jam tastes so good.

561
00:23:20,156 --> 00:23:22,156
Our parents would love it.

562
00:23:22,156 --> 00:23:23,456
(It's a popular souvenir too.)

563
00:23:23,456 --> 00:23:27,686
Your mission has been completed.

564
00:23:27,686 --> 00:23:30,686
(They have completed their mission by trying 5 Taiwanese dishes.)

565
00:23:31,926 --> 00:23:33,426
Haha looks so happy.

566
00:23:33,686 --> 00:23:34,786
He's so happy.

567
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:37,626
I feel sorry for Team Osaka.

568
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:39,186
I wonder...

569
00:23:39,526 --> 00:23:41,286
- what they're doing right now. - What they're doing right now.

570
00:23:45,526 --> 00:23:47,326
We've been in a hurry all day.

571
00:23:47,656 --> 00:23:49,256
We've been so busy.

572
00:23:49,256 --> 00:23:51,586
If there's a shopping mall around the airport,

573
00:23:51,586 --> 00:23:54,286
let's look around.

574
00:23:55,286 --> 00:23:56,956
How long does it take to the airport?

575
00:23:56,956 --> 00:23:59,556
- More than 30 minutes. - We'll be there around 4:30pm.

576
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:00,756
(We spent too much time in the bathhouse.)

577
00:24:00,756 --> 00:24:03,256
This tour has been so hectic.

578
00:24:03,386 --> 00:24:04,426
It has.

579
00:24:04,426 --> 00:24:05,956
We've done so much.

580
00:24:05,956 --> 00:24:07,926
(The six hours went so fast.)

581
00:24:08,226 --> 00:24:10,086
So Min is so funny.

582
00:24:10,086 --> 00:24:11,556
She said...

583
00:24:11,556 --> 00:24:14,186
- she'd take care of us. - She said she'd take care of us.

584
00:24:14,456 --> 00:24:16,986
I made things easier for you.

585
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,656
"Eat."

586
00:24:20,086 --> 00:24:22,126
"Add chives. Add garlics."

587
00:24:22,856 --> 00:24:25,186
We like freedom.

588
00:24:25,456 --> 00:24:27,726
- We don't want to be controlled. - We hate it.

589
00:24:28,326 --> 00:24:30,786
You're so oblivious.

590
00:24:31,756 --> 00:24:35,586
As I'm on the same team with Seok Jin this time,

591
00:24:35,856 --> 00:24:37,926
So I think I'll be able to enjoy being on the same team...

592
00:24:37,956 --> 00:24:39,726
with anybody else and...

593
00:24:40,056 --> 00:24:41,426
Wait. That's not what I mean.

594
00:24:41,426 --> 00:24:45,926
So you're saying that I'm the worst teammate you could ever have.

595
00:24:45,926 --> 00:24:48,786
Right? After being on the same team with me,

596
00:24:48,786 --> 00:24:50,256
you can handle everybody else.

597
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:52,456
Am I really the worst teammate you could ever have?

598
00:24:52,456 --> 00:24:55,556
- I can't believe she said that. - My goodness.

599
00:24:56,826 --> 00:24:57,986
We're here.

600
00:24:58,656 --> 00:25:00,456
We don't have enough time to do the mission, right?

601
00:25:01,026 --> 00:25:05,586
Right now, it's time for us to go back.

602
00:25:05,586 --> 00:25:07,756
- Exactly. We have to go back. - My gosh.

603
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,056
Is this the last plane?

604
00:25:09,056 --> 00:25:14,026
Yes. I'm sorry to say that you've failed the mission.

605
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:16,786
So one of you are going to get the Tour Sticker.

606
00:25:16,786 --> 00:25:19,856
- Do you remember the game? - Yes.

607
00:25:19,856 --> 00:25:23,526
The one whose shoe lands on a different mission will get it.

608
00:25:23,526 --> 00:25:25,956
- That's a great idea. - Yes, let's do that.

609
00:25:25,956 --> 00:25:27,656
(There are 9 boxes with 3 different types of missions written on them.)

610
00:25:27,656 --> 00:25:28,786
So Min can go first.

611
00:25:28,786 --> 00:25:30,286
You need to follow me, okay?

612
00:25:30,286 --> 00:25:32,226
If you fail to throw your shoe inside the box,

613
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:34,156
- you're out. - That person will get the sticker.

614
00:25:34,156 --> 00:25:36,856
- That's not fair. - Go on.

615
00:25:36,856 --> 00:25:38,356
(The reason she's so nervous is because...)

616
00:25:38,586 --> 00:25:40,226
(when they arrived at Osaka 7 hours ago,)

617
00:25:41,186 --> 00:25:43,126
(she failed to throw her shoe inside the box.)

618
00:25:43,226 --> 00:25:45,426
- Hey! - Put some effort into the game.

619
00:25:45,426 --> 00:25:48,056
- Costume play! - Don't aim for a certain box.

620
00:25:48,056 --> 00:25:49,656
(She failed to get her shoe inside any of the boxes.)

621
00:25:50,586 --> 00:25:53,056
(She wasted 30 minutes in selecting a mission.)

622
00:25:54,056 --> 00:25:56,556
(So Min doesn't know how to aim and throw.)

623
00:25:57,986 --> 00:25:59,586
- Do I go first? - Yes.

624
00:25:59,586 --> 00:26:01,556
- You need to follow me, okay? - Okay, don't worry.

625
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,456
(Please aim for the mission I get.)

626
00:26:04,286 --> 00:26:07,126
(Previously, out of 14 throws, she only succeeded once.)

627
00:26:07,926 --> 00:26:10,426
(Will she fail again?)

628
00:26:11,956 --> 00:26:13,056
You got it in.

629
00:26:13,056 --> 00:26:14,756
(She got it inside the box.)

630
00:26:15,056 --> 00:26:17,156
- You're good. - It's my turn.

631
00:26:17,156 --> 00:26:18,656
- It's your turn. - Aim for the costume play box.

632
00:26:18,656 --> 00:26:20,586
- I'll go for the costume play. - Okay.

633
00:26:20,586 --> 00:26:22,726
I'm really bad at aiming.

634
00:26:23,686 --> 00:26:25,456
I'm not so confident.

635
00:26:25,456 --> 00:26:27,226
(If he fails, he'll be the one to get the Tour Sticker.)

636
00:26:29,056 --> 00:26:32,386
(He must get it inside one of the boxes.)

637
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:38,256
(What will happen to Jae Seok?)

638
00:26:39,286 --> 00:26:41,186
You failed!

639
00:26:43,456 --> 00:26:45,956
- Wait a minute. - You failed. Let go of me.

640
00:26:45,956 --> 00:26:48,026
- Let go! - Wait, Seok Jin.

641
00:26:48,026 --> 00:26:51,486
- Please give me another chance. - No way. It doesn't work like that.

642
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:52,756
You failed.

643
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,186
- If you fail, we get to go again. - Of course.

644
00:26:55,186 --> 00:26:56,656
(If Seok Jin fails too, they'll have a rematch.)

645
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:59,586
(If he succeeds, Jae Seok will be the one to get the Tour Sticker.)

646
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:04,026
(The fate of the Tour Sticker is in Seok Jin's shoe.)

647
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:06,286
(Will he fail?)

648
00:27:06,286 --> 00:27:08,756
(Or will he succeed?)

649
00:27:09,656 --> 00:27:11,686
(What will be their destiny?)

650
00:27:12,686 --> 00:27:15,456
(Seok Jin succeeds.)

651
00:27:16,456 --> 00:27:19,426
(Jae Seok gets one Tour Sticker.)

652
00:27:19,426 --> 00:27:21,056
- Jae Seok failed on purpose. - Yes, I think he did.

653
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,426
I can't believe how hard this is.

654
00:27:23,426 --> 00:27:24,486
(Feeling unfair.)

655
00:27:24,526 --> 00:27:27,026
(All three teams have now completed their one-day trip.)

656
00:27:28,256 --> 00:27:29,326
(Everyone comes back at around 10pm.)

657
00:27:29,326 --> 00:27:31,686
- I'm so tired. - We're back.

658
00:27:31,926 --> 00:27:34,026
Is it 3am again?

659
00:27:34,156 --> 00:27:36,856
I'm sorry Do Yeon. Do Yeon!

660
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:38,126
Do Yeon, are you okay?

661
00:27:38,226 --> 00:27:40,326
- I'm back alive. - Do Yeon.

662
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:41,656
Good job, Do Yeon.

663
00:27:42,226 --> 00:27:44,226
I thought I was going to be treated like a queen.

664
00:27:45,126 --> 00:27:46,556
You're just a tall woman.

665
00:27:46,556 --> 00:27:47,986
I guess I'm just a tall woman.

666
00:27:48,256 --> 00:27:50,256
I'll announce the results of the team missions.

667
00:27:50,256 --> 00:27:52,426
Team Taipei, you completed your mission.

668
00:27:52,456 --> 00:27:55,656
(Team Taipei succeeded in their mission.)

669
00:27:55,656 --> 00:27:58,326
- All you had to do was eat. - Exactly.

670
00:27:58,326 --> 00:27:59,386
We had to eat stinky tofu,

671
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,256
- I'm so hungry. - and Se Chan...

672
00:28:01,256 --> 00:28:02,756
- Stop it. - Should I?

673
00:28:02,756 --> 00:28:03,956
- Why? - Tell us.

674
00:28:03,956 --> 00:28:05,456
He said it tasted like Do Yeon's foot.

675
00:28:05,456 --> 00:28:07,686
- Stop. - Stop it already.

676
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,926
(Was Do Yeon's foot in Taipei?)

677
00:28:09,926 --> 00:28:11,756
(Stop making fun of me.)

678
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:14,026
- Can I just say one swear word? - Don't.

679
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,456
(You little stinky tofu.)

680
00:28:15,456 --> 00:28:17,286
What? What did you say?

681
00:28:17,286 --> 00:28:19,656
- What was that? - It was nothing.

682
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:23,226
- Good job. - It's really a bad habit.

683
00:28:23,226 --> 00:28:24,786
- He uses my weakness. - I understand.

684
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,926
I always say good things about you. My gosh, forget it.

685
00:28:27,926 --> 00:28:29,226
(Forget it.)

686
00:28:29,226 --> 00:28:31,326
(There's no point in talking to you.)

687
00:28:31,656 --> 00:28:34,056
- Let's carry on with the show. - You lost.

688
00:28:34,056 --> 00:28:36,226
- Don't take it too seriously. - He's right.

689
00:28:36,226 --> 00:28:37,656
- I lost. - It's just a joke.

690
00:28:37,656 --> 00:28:40,156
- Team Jeju Island. - Yes.

691
00:28:40,156 --> 00:28:42,956
Thanks to your team leader, Do Yeon, you guys completed the mission.

692
00:28:42,956 --> 00:28:44,286
(Thanks to Do Yeon, they successfully completed the mission.)

693
00:28:44,286 --> 00:28:46,186
- We did it. - Thank you.

694
00:28:46,186 --> 00:28:48,026
(Do Yeon was left alone in Jeju Island.)

695
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,126
Hello. I'd like to have one bowl of ramyeon, please.

696
00:28:51,756 --> 00:28:53,326
My gosh, it looks incredible.

697
00:28:53,526 --> 00:28:56,686
Look at this meal. It looks great.

698
00:28:58,156 --> 00:28:59,356
(Its spicy soup is perfect for chilly weather.)

699
00:28:59,356 --> 00:29:02,956
Look at the octopus and abalone. They're so big.

700
00:29:04,226 --> 00:29:05,556
It's so soft.

701
00:29:06,156 --> 00:29:08,556
Kwang Soo, we suffered so much because of this octopus.

702
00:29:08,556 --> 00:29:10,156
(If only Kwang Soo knows what this tastes like...)

703
00:29:10,156 --> 00:29:12,456
(Here, have a bite, my friend.)

704
00:29:12,456 --> 00:29:13,756
(The imaginary Kwang Soo takes a big bite.)

705
00:29:14,156 --> 00:29:15,656
You eat well, Kwang Soo.

706
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,156
(I'm so lonely.)

707
00:29:20,156 --> 00:29:21,286
I'm so lonely.

708
00:29:23,056 --> 00:29:24,656
(She completed the mission on her own.)

709
00:29:24,656 --> 00:29:28,156
Team Osaka. You succeeded in meeting Mr. Suzuki,

710
00:29:28,156 --> 00:29:30,356
but because of the Chance Card attack, you failed your mission.

711
00:29:30,356 --> 00:29:31,856
This is so unfair.

712
00:29:31,856 --> 00:29:34,956
It was so hard to find Mr. Suzuki. Jae Seok gets one sticker.

713
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:36,926
- Jae Seok got one. - He might go on the trip.

714
00:29:36,926 --> 00:29:40,626
It's not over yet. You were told to buy a gift for...

715
00:29:40,626 --> 00:29:42,926
- your designated member. - That's right.

716
00:29:42,926 --> 00:29:44,156
- I remember. - Yes, that's right.

717
00:29:44,156 --> 00:29:47,656
Now, it's time for you to give it to its owner.

718
00:29:47,656 --> 00:29:51,686
- Okay. - Let's start from Kwang Soo.

719
00:29:51,686 --> 00:29:52,726
Okay.

720
00:29:52,856 --> 00:29:54,926
(Kwang Soo chose...)

721
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,686
He chose Jae Seok.

722
00:29:56,786 --> 00:29:58,526
- It's my present for you. - It's very heavy.

723
00:29:58,526 --> 00:30:01,156
- It's nothing much. - Thank you, Kwang Soo.

724
00:30:01,256 --> 00:30:03,286
The person who received a present should go next.

725
00:30:03,286 --> 00:30:05,326
- It looks light. - What?

726
00:30:05,456 --> 00:30:06,526
Give it to Jong Kook.

727
00:30:07,226 --> 00:30:10,026
- Is it for me? - I got it from Japan.

728
00:30:10,026 --> 00:30:11,656
- Really? - I'll go next.

729
00:30:11,656 --> 00:30:14,326
- You will be so moved. - Why?

730
00:30:14,326 --> 00:30:15,956
- It's for Seok Jin. - Really?

731
00:30:15,956 --> 00:30:18,256
- Take a look. You'll like it. - It looks heavy.

732
00:30:18,256 --> 00:30:20,156
- It's really warm. - It must be poop.

733
00:30:20,156 --> 00:30:22,026
(It must be poop.)

734
00:30:22,026 --> 00:30:23,386
(You little...)

735
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:25,486
- My gosh. - It's not poop.

736
00:30:25,486 --> 00:30:27,756
- I can't believe you said that. - It could be his own.

737
00:30:27,756 --> 00:30:30,486
- My gosh. - If it's warm, it could be that.

738
00:30:31,486 --> 00:30:33,286
(Everyone finishes exchanging gifts.)

739
00:30:33,286 --> 00:30:36,556
- This was great. - It's getting warmer,

740
00:30:36,556 --> 00:30:39,326
- so a lot of people were on trips. - There were so many.

741
00:30:39,326 --> 00:30:42,156
- The ambiance was lovely. - I had a great time.

742
00:30:42,156 --> 00:30:44,786
- It was really lovely. - You guys must think it's over now.

743
00:30:44,786 --> 00:30:47,126
- Aren't we done? - We exchanged gifts.

744
00:30:47,126 --> 00:30:49,486
Do we have to play another game now?

745
00:30:49,486 --> 00:30:53,486
- You guys exchanged gifts. - That's right.

746
00:30:53,486 --> 00:30:56,226
- I knew this would happen. - There's one last mission for you.

747
00:30:56,226 --> 00:30:58,226
- What is it? - It's Scale of Justice.

748
00:30:58,226 --> 00:31:00,786
- Please hold this. - We need to weigh something?

749
00:31:00,786 --> 00:31:03,526
The weight of your gift will decide whether you win or lose.

750
00:31:03,526 --> 00:31:06,586
The person who has the heavier present will be the winner.

751
00:31:06,586 --> 00:31:08,086
- My gosh. - The heavier one?

752
00:31:08,556 --> 00:31:11,526
(It's advantageous to have a heavier present?)

753
00:31:11,526 --> 00:31:13,856
Do we get a Tour Sticker if we lose?

754
00:31:13,926 --> 00:31:16,786
- Yes. - Are you serious?

755
00:31:17,526 --> 00:31:20,026
(The loser will get a Tour Sticker.)

756
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:24,356
(It'll bring them one step closer to the dangerous tourist attraction.)

757
00:31:24,356 --> 00:31:26,956
(Who will be the unlucky one to get the Tour Sticker?)

758
00:31:26,956 --> 00:31:29,356
- Mine's really light too. - The first person to...

759
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:32,526
- weigh their bag is Jong Kook. - It's Jong Kook's turn.

760
00:31:32,786 --> 00:31:34,926
- The heavier one will win. - But Jong Kook's bag looks light.

761
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:38,286
- Exactly. - I didn't know about this game.

762
00:31:38,286 --> 00:31:40,556
- I got him something light. - This is as light as his mouth.

763
00:31:40,956 --> 00:31:42,856
- I'm serious. - My goodness.

764
00:31:42,856 --> 00:31:46,156
- Is it that light? - I'm sure you'll like the present.

765
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:48,056
- I'm doomed. - I guess he got him something nice.

766
00:31:48,056 --> 00:31:49,456
Who's going to go against me?

767
00:31:49,456 --> 00:31:52,226
- It's going to be Jae Seok. - My gosh, this is unbelievable.

768
00:31:52,226 --> 00:31:54,586
- I can't believe this. - You can just leave it there.

769
00:31:54,586 --> 00:31:56,856
I already have a Tour Sticker.

770
00:31:56,856 --> 00:31:58,656
- You can get one more. - Let's go.

771
00:31:58,656 --> 00:32:01,156
In 1, 2, 3.

772
00:32:01,156 --> 00:32:03,056
(The first round of Scale of Justice)

773
00:32:03,686 --> 00:32:07,126
(Whose bag will be lighter?)

774
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:09,926
(Jong Kook's bag is light while Jae Seok's bag is very heavy.)

775
00:32:11,726 --> 00:32:13,656
(What?)

776
00:32:13,656 --> 00:32:16,156
- You lost. - My goodness.

777
00:32:16,156 --> 00:32:18,986
- My gosh, Jong Kook. - I feel so bad.

778
00:32:19,226 --> 00:32:21,226
- You're so stupid. - What were you thinking?

779
00:32:21,226 --> 00:32:23,426
- Hey, Kwang Soo! - He thought he won.

780
00:32:23,426 --> 00:32:25,326
- No problem, Jae Seok. - Thank you.

781
00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:27,656
The person who loses against Jong Kook...

782
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:30,326
- He got me tangerines. - Really?

783
00:32:30,326 --> 00:32:32,856
(These tangerines saved my life.)

784
00:32:32,856 --> 00:32:34,456
- That's right! - Kwang Soo!

785
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:36,656
- Kwang Soo. - When did you get them?

786
00:32:36,656 --> 00:32:39,026
- I got them just for you. - When did you buy them?

787
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:40,486
I got it when I had time.

788
00:32:40,486 --> 00:32:42,956
I would've gotten a Tour Sticker if it hadn't been for you.

789
00:32:43,386 --> 00:32:45,556
I could've gone on the trip next week.

790
00:32:45,556 --> 00:32:47,326
That's enough. Stop it.

791
00:32:47,326 --> 00:32:50,156
- Stop it. - I'm so happy.

792
00:32:50,156 --> 00:32:52,856
- It's Seok Jin's turn now. - Come on.

793
00:32:52,856 --> 00:32:54,326
In 1, 2, 3.

794
00:32:54,626 --> 00:32:55,926
(Seok Jin wins easily.)

795
00:32:55,926 --> 00:32:57,026
(What a gift!)

796
00:32:57,026 --> 00:32:59,926
- Thank you. - Seok Jin's really happy right now.

797
00:32:59,926 --> 00:33:02,056
- Did you see him disappointed? - My goodness.

798
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:04,126
(So Min wins easily too.)

799
00:33:04,126 --> 00:33:06,156
- What is it? - It's bread.

800
00:33:06,156 --> 00:33:07,486
They're leftovers of what we had.

801
00:33:07,856 --> 00:33:09,756
(Jong Kook wanted to give her the leftovers.)

802
00:33:09,756 --> 00:33:11,486
- We ate that. - Look.

803
00:33:11,486 --> 00:33:13,086
It wasn't delicious at all.

804
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:14,586
(He's lost for 4 consecutive times now.)

805
00:33:14,586 --> 00:33:16,586
How light is Jong Kook's bag?

806
00:33:16,586 --> 00:33:18,726
I got it for you so you can drink at home.

807
00:33:19,326 --> 00:33:21,786
- Who got that? - Seok Jin.

808
00:33:21,956 --> 00:33:22,956
(Jong Kook loses again.)

809
00:33:22,956 --> 00:33:24,556
- My gosh. - How can this be?

810
00:33:24,556 --> 00:33:27,256
- This is a great present. - I know.

811
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:29,426
- Really? - You can give that to your son.

812
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:31,326
- Thank you so much. - It's a coin bank.

813
00:33:31,326 --> 00:33:33,586
- Where's the rock? I brought it. - The rock?

814
00:33:33,586 --> 00:33:34,626
Here it is.

815
00:33:35,126 --> 00:33:36,726
- What? - What is that?

816
00:33:37,426 --> 00:33:39,026
(It's really just a rock.)

817
00:33:39,426 --> 00:33:41,356
- She's really weird. - Right?

818
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:44,326
I told you, didn't I? She becomes really weird.

819
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:46,126
- What is that? - What's that for?

820
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:48,556
- I got it for you as a souvenir. - Are you serious?

821
00:33:48,556 --> 00:33:49,856
He might throw it away.

822
00:33:49,856 --> 00:33:51,056
In 1, 2, 3.

823
00:33:51,056 --> 00:33:52,956
(Jong Kook loses six times in a row.)

824
00:33:52,956 --> 00:33:55,326
- Jong Kook. - Jong Kook, you're doomed.

825
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:58,156
- What is in that bag? - I'm so curious.

826
00:33:58,156 --> 00:33:59,656
There's a meaning behind my present.

827
00:33:59,656 --> 00:34:01,386
(What's inside Kwang Soo's bag?)

828
00:34:02,426 --> 00:34:03,926
(3 hours ago at a convenience store in Jeju Island)

829
00:34:04,156 --> 00:34:05,226
(She grabs something.)

830
00:34:05,226 --> 00:34:07,026
I'm going to get octopus' friends.

831
00:34:07,026 --> 00:34:08,386
(She gets a squid snack.)

832
00:34:08,386 --> 00:34:12,226
(She gets Kwang Soo some squid snacks.)

833
00:34:12,226 --> 00:34:13,956
He won't throw these away, will he?

834
00:34:13,986 --> 00:34:15,826
(No way.)

835
00:34:15,856 --> 00:34:17,856
(Throwing)

836
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:18,956
(He immediately throws them away.)

837
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:20,856
- Why did you do that? - Are you serious?

838
00:34:20,856 --> 00:34:23,556
- Hey! - What did she get you?

839
00:34:23,556 --> 00:34:25,386
(The memories of Jeju Island are quite painful.)

840
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,956
- Se Chan. - Now, it's...

841
00:34:29,156 --> 00:34:31,656
- Se Chan's turn. - Se Chan needs to be careful.

842
00:34:31,656 --> 00:34:34,156
- Se Chan. - If you lose,

843
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:35,556
- you'd be done for. - Se Chan.

844
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:37,686
- Se Chan. - Just go to the airport right away.

845
00:34:37,686 --> 00:34:40,026
- What did you put in the backpack? - Se Chan, snacks are in there.

846
00:34:40,026 --> 00:34:42,156
- We don't know what will happen. - Se Chan can head straight there.

847
00:34:42,156 --> 00:34:44,186
- His backpack is really light. - One...

848
00:34:44,186 --> 00:34:45,656
(Se Chan's backpack looks light at a glance.)

849
00:34:46,186 --> 00:34:47,326
Two...

850
00:34:47,326 --> 00:34:49,986
(What is the result of the seventh weighing?)

851
00:34:49,986 --> 00:34:51,056
Let go.

852
00:34:51,686 --> 00:34:53,386
- What's happening? - What is going on?

853
00:34:53,386 --> 00:34:54,456
- How can this happen? - What is this?

854
00:34:55,186 --> 00:34:56,656
(How can this be so close?)

855
00:34:56,656 --> 00:34:57,926
- Does this make sense? - Is it tied?

856
00:34:57,926 --> 00:34:59,556
In case this happened,

857
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,296
we have prepared a scale that will tell us the weight.

858
00:35:03,156 --> 00:35:06,526
We will weigh the backpacks to figure out their weights.

859
00:35:06,526 --> 00:35:07,756
If I lose here, I'm done.

860
00:35:08,626 --> 00:35:09,856
This is Jong Kook's backpack.

861
00:35:09,856 --> 00:35:11,826
(We will weigh it precisely.)

862
00:35:12,586 --> 00:35:15,326
(The weight of Jong Kook's is...)

863
00:35:15,326 --> 00:35:16,586
It's 945g.

864
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,556
- It weighs 945g. - The weight is 945g.

865
00:35:18,556 --> 00:35:19,586
Next.

866
00:35:20,226 --> 00:35:21,796
I don't know who's going to win.

867
00:35:21,796 --> 00:35:23,426
(If Se Chan loses, he will move one step closer to the dangerous trip.)

868
00:35:23,426 --> 00:35:24,756
Se Chan.

869
00:35:26,886 --> 00:35:30,926
(Will Jong Kook lose? Or will Se Chan, the new unlucky guy, lose?)

870
00:35:31,726 --> 00:35:32,826
Let go of the backpack.

871
00:35:32,826 --> 00:35:33,926
- Yes! - It weighs 822g.

872
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:36,056
(Se Chan's backpack weighs 822g.)

873
00:35:36,056 --> 00:35:37,586
- I won, right? - Jong Kook wins.

874
00:35:38,056 --> 00:35:39,226
- Poor Se Chan. - I'm saved.

875
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,756
- Poor Se Chan. - Show us what's in the backpack.

876
00:35:42,756 --> 00:35:44,256
- Se Chan will go on the trip. - I didn't know.

877
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,796
- Se Chan now has two stickers. - I really didn't know about this.

878
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:48,256
- I got this for Jong Kook. - Is that underwear?

879
00:35:48,256 --> 00:35:50,296
- What is this? - They are underpants.

880
00:35:51,256 --> 00:35:53,326
- You like the US. - Aren't they for a girl?

881
00:35:54,426 --> 00:35:55,726
(It was underwear.)

882
00:35:55,726 --> 00:35:56,796
I like it.

883
00:35:56,796 --> 00:35:58,726
- It's a thoughtful gift. - Aren't they nice?

884
00:35:58,726 --> 00:36:00,756
- I'll wear them in the US. - You should.

885
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,026
You'll feel like you're in the US with just socks and underpants.

886
00:36:05,326 --> 00:36:07,626
- I thought about you. - Thank you.

887
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:09,296
- Jae Seok thought about him. - That is a sincere gift.

888
00:36:09,296 --> 00:36:10,626
- Of course. - They look great on you.

889
00:36:10,686 --> 00:36:13,386
Do Yeon, you are the last one and will place your backpack soon.

890
00:36:13,526 --> 00:36:17,056
Do Yeon is a guest and Tour Stickers don't apply to her.

891
00:36:17,056 --> 00:36:19,956
That's why we installed something special in her name tag...

892
00:36:19,956 --> 00:36:22,226
- just in case she lost. - Really?

893
00:36:22,226 --> 00:36:26,356
(If she is ranked last, the member on her left gets the Tour Sticker.)

894
00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:27,526
- Please. - All right.

895
00:36:27,526 --> 00:36:29,386
- We will weigh Do Yeon's backpack. - Let's weigh mine.

896
00:36:29,586 --> 00:36:31,156
- Se Chan's weighs 822g. - We don't know yet.

897
00:36:31,296 --> 00:36:32,826
- You have to place it on the scale. - Wait.

898
00:36:32,826 --> 00:36:34,386
(Will it weigh more than 822g or not?)

899
00:36:34,386 --> 00:36:37,156
(The last weighing will determine the member who will be ranked last.)

900
00:36:38,256 --> 00:36:43,556
(The result will bring him closer to the dangerous tourist attraction.)

901
00:36:43,556 --> 00:36:46,556
(Which 1 of these 2 will be ranked last?)

902
00:36:47,326 --> 00:36:49,386
- It's 835g. - Her backpack weighs 835g.

903
00:36:50,086 --> 00:36:52,796
(On the grounds that he has the lightest backpack,)

904
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:55,086
(Se Chan will receive a Tour Sticker.)

905
00:36:55,086 --> 00:36:56,256
Good for you!

906
00:36:57,556 --> 00:36:58,796
- It's Se Chan. - He got it.

907
00:36:58,796 --> 00:36:59,796
(Why is my life so hard?)

908
00:36:59,796 --> 00:37:01,856
- The difference was 13g. - Is this really happening?

909
00:37:02,026 --> 00:37:03,826
- I didn't know this would happen. - Okay, Haha.

910
00:37:03,826 --> 00:37:05,426
- We were family. - Let's open her backpack.

911
00:37:05,426 --> 00:37:06,586
Let's see what Ji Hyo gave her.

912
00:37:06,586 --> 00:37:07,886
- Sure. - It's Se Chan.

913
00:37:07,886 --> 00:37:09,426
- He's so unlucky. - He is indeed.

914
00:37:09,556 --> 00:37:11,156
- What is it? - It's aroma oil.

915
00:37:11,886 --> 00:37:13,326
- I like it. - I bought it for her because...

916
00:37:13,326 --> 00:37:16,226
Se Chan kept teasing her about her feet.

917
00:37:16,226 --> 00:37:18,826
Is this show about health? We talked about my feet for hours.

918
00:37:18,826 --> 00:37:22,226
(This isn't a health program. Let's stop talking about my feet.)

919
00:37:22,226 --> 00:37:23,426
- No. - Do Yeon, you will need it.

920
00:37:23,426 --> 00:37:24,756
- You will need it later. - What is this?

921
00:37:24,756 --> 00:37:26,626
- My feet are healthy. - It will be useful in the future.

922
00:37:26,626 --> 00:37:27,796
It's for your future.

923
00:37:27,796 --> 00:37:29,556
- When you have your foot bath, - She washed her feet.

924
00:37:29,556 --> 00:37:31,486
- I really like this though. - you can relax.

925
00:37:31,486 --> 00:37:32,986
- I really like this oil. - It's good oil too.

926
00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:35,226
- What does this mean? - It holds a meaning.

927
00:37:35,226 --> 00:37:37,856
Since you became a part of our Running Man family,

928
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:40,796
you'll be running a lot. I didn't want you to get athlete's foot.

929
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:42,886
- That's why I gave them to you. - That's cool.

930
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,686
- These are meaningful. - Yes, they are.

931
00:37:44,856 --> 00:37:46,656
You can go and get that meaningful punishment.

932
00:37:46,986 --> 00:37:48,126
You can wear them on the trip.

933
00:37:48,526 --> 00:37:52,586
Anyway, Se Chan is ranked last for the race, Dangerous Trips.

934
00:37:52,586 --> 00:37:53,856
(Se Chan finishes last in the race.)

935
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:56,296
- He's the new unlucky guy. - It was so close though.

936
00:37:56,556 --> 00:37:58,326
- He's in the lead. - I can't believe it.

937
00:37:58,386 --> 00:38:02,186
Running Man's new project is a global race with new members.

938
00:38:02,186 --> 00:38:03,256
(Global race with new members)

939
00:38:03,256 --> 00:38:04,626
(A member will go on a trip with 3 Tour Stickers.)

940
00:38:04,626 --> 00:38:06,626
(Which member will go on a trip to the dangerous tourist attraction?)

941
00:38:06,626 --> 00:38:08,226
(Running Man's Global Project: Dangerous Tourist Attractions)

942
00:38:08,226 --> 00:38:10,426
- Hello. Hi. - Hi.

943
00:38:10,426 --> 00:38:12,056
(In April, Deungchon SBS)

944
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,826
(Haha is the last one to stand in his spot for the opening segment.)

945
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,456
(What? What is that?)

946
00:38:17,456 --> 00:38:19,726
(He's wearing a colorful outfit for spring.)

947
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,026
(The whole staff laugh.)

948
00:38:22,156 --> 00:38:23,556
Haha looks like a kid.

949
00:38:24,326 --> 00:38:25,556
Look at the color of your pants.

950
00:38:25,726 --> 00:38:28,256
Now, even the staff members are laughing at me.

951
00:38:28,386 --> 00:38:31,126
After the identity of his mentor for the outfits was revealed,

952
00:38:31,626 --> 00:38:34,126
his outfits have changed a lot and that part even aired on TV.

953
00:38:34,126 --> 00:38:36,926
(His outfits changed after everyone found out he was copying outfits.)

954
00:38:37,556 --> 00:38:40,626
- Look! It's Haha's fashion mentor. - Stop it.

955
00:38:40,856 --> 00:38:43,796
(I'm sorry, Haha, but stop copying my outfits.)

956
00:38:43,796 --> 00:38:45,426
Stay in the car!

957
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:48,256
I said hello to Young Jin because I thought he was Haha.

958
00:38:48,256 --> 00:38:49,886
He used to copy his outfits.

959
00:38:50,626 --> 00:38:52,326
Fortunately,

960
00:38:52,326 --> 00:38:57,556
a lot of viewers are happy that Se Chan and So Min have joined.

961
00:38:57,656 --> 00:38:59,556
- 9012... - Forever!

962
00:38:59,556 --> 00:39:00,656
Forever!

963
00:39:00,656 --> 00:39:02,086
Although Gary did get married...

964
00:39:02,456 --> 00:39:04,086
Although Gary changed his number...

965
00:39:04,456 --> 00:39:06,426
- Although we didn't know... - Although we didn't know...

966
00:39:06,456 --> 00:39:08,186
- 9012! - 9012!

967
00:39:08,386 --> 00:39:09,986
- We won't abandon him. - He didn't even contact us.

968
00:39:10,226 --> 00:39:12,986
- Right. He did change his number. - He didn't tell us he got married.

969
00:39:13,126 --> 00:39:15,456
Gary, where are you?

970
00:39:16,156 --> 00:39:19,626
- We won't try to visit you. - Are you even in Korea?

971
00:39:19,626 --> 00:39:22,296
You're forever in our hearts. 9012!

972
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:24,586
The funny thing about him is that he keeps sending me hats.

973
00:39:24,726 --> 00:39:26,326
- He does? - I just can't reach him.

974
00:39:26,326 --> 00:39:28,356
- He sent them anonymously. - That's right.

975
00:39:28,356 --> 00:39:29,926
- I'm so grateful. - He keeps sending the hats.

976
00:39:29,926 --> 00:39:31,726
He turned into an anonymous philanthropist.

977
00:39:32,296 --> 00:39:34,056
He became an anonymous philanthropist for Haha.

978
00:39:34,796 --> 00:39:36,296
- Goodness. - I don't know his number.

979
00:39:36,296 --> 00:39:39,186
Se Chan and So Min. What do your acquaintances say about the show?

980
00:39:39,186 --> 00:39:44,626
Before I joined, fans abroad already told me how they felt about me.

981
00:39:45,296 --> 00:39:47,926
- I don't speak English though. - Me neither.

982
00:39:47,926 --> 00:39:50,686
- Do you understand only a bit? - I know "Don't" and "Hate you".

983
00:39:51,086 --> 00:39:52,856
Those comments sort of bothered me.

984
00:39:52,856 --> 00:39:54,026
I know what "Hate you" means.

985
00:39:54,326 --> 00:39:55,586
They don't want me to join.

986
00:39:55,686 --> 00:39:58,856
A fan put a heart between Se Chan and me...

987
00:39:58,856 --> 00:40:00,156
- so that we become a couple. - That's right.

988
00:40:00,156 --> 00:40:02,056
- The fan wants you to be a couple. - Nowadays,

989
00:40:02,256 --> 00:40:04,756
- fans want a love interest. - That's true.

990
00:40:04,756 --> 00:40:06,456
- They wrote nice comments. - The fan meant that I can't be...

991
00:40:06,456 --> 00:40:09,926
a couple with other members. I should only be with Se Chan.

992
00:40:09,926 --> 00:40:11,626
- Only you and I. - So it means...

993
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,456
the fans want them to be only with each other.

994
00:40:13,526 --> 00:40:16,226
- She can't be with other members? - Fans are protecting other members.

995
00:40:16,226 --> 00:40:17,726
- They don't want us to be involved. - How about with Kwang Soo?

996
00:40:17,726 --> 00:40:19,456
They said I can never be with him.

997
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,926
I am only allowed to be with Se Chan.

998
00:40:21,756 --> 00:40:24,226
But a lot of people liked them after the show aired.

999
00:40:24,226 --> 00:40:25,386
- I agree. - They did.

1000
00:40:25,386 --> 00:40:29,326
Anyway, Se Chan has two Tour Stickers for the race.

1001
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:30,456
- I do. - Look at Se Chan.

1002
00:40:30,456 --> 00:40:32,796
If he gets another one this week, he will have to go on the trip.

1003
00:40:32,796 --> 00:40:34,856
This is driving me crazy.

1004
00:40:35,586 --> 00:40:38,796
Today is the part 3 of Running Man's global project.

1005
00:40:39,686 --> 00:40:41,356
Before we reveal today's mission,

1006
00:40:41,826 --> 00:40:44,886
only So Min and Ji Hyo...

1007
00:40:45,926 --> 00:40:48,156
will go inside.

1008
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:49,386
- Why? - To where?

1009
00:40:49,386 --> 00:40:52,226
(Will So Min and Ji Hyo receive a hidden mission or something?)

1010
00:40:53,456 --> 00:40:54,586
What is this?

1011
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:56,756
(There's a huge world map and mysterious houses.)

1012
00:40:56,756 --> 00:40:57,886
Are we going in?

1013
00:40:59,086 --> 00:41:04,386
(There are only 2 female members, but why are there 3 houses?)

1014
00:41:04,386 --> 00:41:08,556
The first mission will divide you into 3 teams of 3 members.

1015
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:11,686
It's Guess with Your Senses.

1016
00:41:11,686 --> 00:41:15,756
So Min, Ji Hyo, and a special, female guest...

1017
00:41:15,886 --> 00:41:20,056
are in the houses you see on the side.

1018
00:41:20,056 --> 00:41:21,186
- Okay! - Who is it?

1019
00:41:21,186 --> 00:41:22,426
I will be on the special guest's team.

1020
00:41:22,426 --> 00:41:24,456
(I will definitely choose the special guest by all means.)

1021
00:41:24,456 --> 00:41:28,856
You will have to guess the house the guest is in using your senses.

1022
00:41:28,926 --> 00:41:33,456
Members who are on the guest's team will receive a Chance Card.

1023
00:41:33,586 --> 00:41:36,256
- I have to be on the guest's team. - Why?

1024
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:38,926
I have to get that benefit. I am in the most vulnerable position.

1025
00:41:38,926 --> 00:41:40,156
You're right.

1026
00:41:40,156 --> 00:41:42,526
Can we hear them say hello?

1027
00:41:42,526 --> 00:41:45,686
The red house is the first house and so on.

1028
00:41:45,926 --> 00:41:47,926
The first lady in the red house, say hello.

1029
00:41:48,296 --> 00:41:51,456
Hello.

1030
00:41:52,086 --> 00:41:54,126
- That's the guest. - It's Ji Hyo.

1031
00:41:54,126 --> 00:41:55,386
- It has to be the guest. - It sounds like Ji Hyo.

1032
00:41:55,386 --> 00:41:56,926
Let's move onto the second house.

1033
00:41:57,756 --> 00:41:58,886
(How will the 2nd lady sound like?)

1034
00:41:58,886 --> 00:42:01,326
Hello.

1035
00:42:01,326 --> 00:42:02,796
- It's Ji Hyo! - It's her.

1036
00:42:02,926 --> 00:42:04,186
- No, I am not certain that she is. - It's Ji Hyo.

1037
00:42:04,186 --> 00:42:06,086
- That's her. - I know her voice.

1038
00:42:06,086 --> 00:42:07,426
- No, it's not her. - That's definitely her.

1039
00:42:07,426 --> 00:42:09,356
- The second one is Ji Hyo. - I agree.

1040
00:42:09,356 --> 00:42:10,486
- It's Ji Hyo. - It's her.

1041
00:42:10,886 --> 00:42:12,796
Let's hear the third lady's voice.

1042
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:16,186
Hello.

1043
00:42:16,296 --> 00:42:17,986
- It's So Min! - That's right.

1044
00:42:18,226 --> 00:42:20,126
- Is it really her? - "Hello." She tried to sound cute.

1045
00:42:20,126 --> 00:42:22,486
- I think she sounded a bit old. - It's not So Min?

1046
00:42:22,486 --> 00:42:23,686
- "Hello." - Who is that?

1047
00:42:23,686 --> 00:42:26,386
I think I am positive that Ji Hyo is in the second house.

1048
00:42:26,386 --> 00:42:27,556
Really?

1049
00:42:27,556 --> 00:42:29,456
(You think Ji Hyo is in the 2nd house?)

1050
00:42:29,456 --> 00:42:31,926
I won't choose the second house.

1051
00:42:33,186 --> 00:42:34,826
- Don't say that out loud. - Hey, that's mean.

1052
00:42:35,256 --> 00:42:37,586
- Keep your opinion to yourself. - I'm sorry.

1053
00:42:37,586 --> 00:42:38,886
I almost said, "Me too."

1054
00:42:39,826 --> 00:42:42,426
(Jong Kook and Haha, let's have a talk later.)

1055
00:42:42,756 --> 00:42:44,986
All right. The first hint of the senses is...

1056
00:42:45,326 --> 00:42:46,486
sight.

1057
00:42:46,486 --> 00:42:47,626
- Sight? - Sight.

1058
00:42:48,086 --> 00:42:53,156
Their feet will be exposed through the door in the bottom.

1059
00:42:53,296 --> 00:42:57,226
You can guess the house the guest is in by looking at their feet.

1060
00:42:57,456 --> 00:43:00,756
- I've never seen their feet though. - That's true.

1061
00:43:00,756 --> 00:43:03,026
For the last seven years, I've never seen Ji Hyo's feet.

1062
00:43:03,296 --> 00:43:05,856
- You've never seen them? - Maybe I just don't remember.

1063
00:43:05,856 --> 00:43:07,856
- Her feet never left an impression. - It could be because...

1064
00:43:07,856 --> 00:43:10,126
Ji Hyo kicked you a long time ago.

1065
00:43:10,126 --> 00:43:12,056
- That's true. - That's why you don't remember.

1066
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:13,426
Now, Seok Jin goes along with your teasing.

1067
00:43:13,886 --> 00:43:15,256
He doesn't fight you.

1068
00:43:15,456 --> 00:43:17,826
- Ji Hyo kicked him in the face. - She kicked my face.

1069
00:43:17,826 --> 00:43:19,926
He passed out. That's why he doesn't remember her feet.

1070
00:43:19,926 --> 00:43:21,256
(This is the class of a talker with 25 years of experience.)

1071
00:43:21,256 --> 00:43:22,386
We will begin now.

1072
00:43:22,386 --> 00:43:26,356
We will start with the lady in the first house. Please show your foot.

1073
00:43:26,626 --> 00:43:27,686
(Sticking out)

1074
00:43:29,956 --> 00:43:31,356
- Wait! - I can recognize Ji Hyo's feet.

1075
00:43:31,686 --> 00:43:33,226
- Hold on a second. - We can look at it up close?

1076
00:43:33,956 --> 00:43:35,086
- Her pants... - Hey,

1077
00:43:35,086 --> 00:43:36,686
- I think it's Ji Hyo's foot. - It's So Min's foot.

1078
00:43:36,686 --> 00:43:38,186
(Her foot is white and long.)

1079
00:43:38,186 --> 00:43:41,026
Wait. I think she doesn't wear heels a lot by the look of it.

1080
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:42,326
- No, she does. - Since So Min is...

1081
00:43:42,326 --> 00:43:45,156
- tall, she doesn't wear heels. - I see calluses.

1082
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:47,356
- So Min's feet are white. - She has long toes.

1083
00:43:47,356 --> 00:43:48,656
I don't think this is Ji Hyo though.

1084
00:43:48,656 --> 00:43:50,726
Aren't her feet as big as 280mm?

1085
00:43:50,926 --> 00:43:52,156
- It's Do Yeon. - Do Yeon!

1086
00:43:52,156 --> 00:43:53,386
- This is Do Yeon. - It's Do Yeon.

1087
00:43:53,386 --> 00:43:55,386
- Is it her? It's a big foot. - Look at this.

1088
00:43:55,386 --> 00:43:56,786
Look, her foot is as big as Haha's.

1089
00:43:57,526 --> 00:43:59,386
- Stop it. - Come on.

1090
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,826
Kwang Soo, that's not a polite thing to do to a lady.

1091
00:44:01,826 --> 00:44:04,156
- How can a lady's foot be so big? - I'm sorry to do this,

1092
00:44:04,326 --> 00:44:06,856
but my shoe size is about 270mm.

1093
00:44:07,226 --> 00:44:08,286
(Her foot is quite big.)

1094
00:44:08,286 --> 00:44:09,686
- Your foot is big. - It is indeed.

1095
00:44:09,686 --> 00:44:10,886
It's bigger than 250mm.

1096
00:44:10,886 --> 00:44:12,926
- I think so. - If her feet are big,

1097
00:44:13,486 --> 00:44:16,026
- it's not Ji Hyo. - Which celebrities have big feet?

1098
00:44:16,026 --> 00:44:17,226
Can it be Park Chan Sook?

1099
00:44:17,226 --> 00:44:18,326
(Chan Sook is a basketball player.)

1100
00:44:18,326 --> 00:44:19,586
How about Kim Yeon Koung?

1101
00:44:20,086 --> 00:44:21,556
- She can be an athlete. - She could be a player.

1102
00:44:21,556 --> 00:44:23,286
- That's possible. - It's because...

1103
00:44:23,326 --> 00:44:24,926
- her foot is as big as 270mm. - It's Yeon Koung.

1104
00:44:24,926 --> 00:44:26,186
- Yeon Koung? - Yeon Koung?

1105
00:44:26,186 --> 00:44:27,326
(Her identity is becoming more of a mystery.)

1106
00:44:27,326 --> 00:44:28,886
Isn't that So Min's?

1107
00:44:28,886 --> 00:44:30,156
I think it is.

1108
00:44:30,156 --> 00:44:32,286
Let's look at the second lady's foot.

1109
00:44:34,226 --> 00:44:35,886
(Pushing out)

1110
00:44:37,756 --> 00:44:39,386
- It's Ji Hyo. - It's Ji Hyo.

1111
00:44:39,556 --> 00:44:41,656
- It's Ji Hyo. - It's definitely Ji Hyo.

1112
00:44:41,656 --> 00:44:44,856
Ji Hyo likes to paint her toenails dark.

1113
00:44:44,956 --> 00:44:47,226
- It doesn't look cute at all. - It's definitely Ji Hyo.

1114
00:44:47,426 --> 00:44:49,456
- It doesn't look cute at all. - It's very dry.

1115
00:44:49,456 --> 00:44:51,326
- It's very still. - Let's find out her personality.

1116
00:44:51,926 --> 00:44:53,186
See?

1117
00:44:53,186 --> 00:44:54,756
(Don't touch me.)

1118
00:44:54,756 --> 00:44:56,656
(It's definitely Ji Hyo.)

1119
00:44:56,656 --> 00:44:58,756
See? It's Ji Hyo.

1120
00:44:58,756 --> 00:45:00,326
- Definitely. - It's definitely Ji Hyo.

1121
00:45:00,326 --> 00:45:03,026
(Is it really Ji Hyo's foot?)

1122
00:45:03,256 --> 00:45:05,726
You can guess the person's personality from her foot.

1123
00:45:05,726 --> 00:45:07,256
This foot looks a bit aggressive.

1124
00:45:07,256 --> 00:45:08,626
- It's sharp. - It looks angry.

1125
00:45:08,626 --> 00:45:10,326
- It's aggressive. - It's angry.

1126
00:45:10,326 --> 00:45:12,356
Ji Hyo doesn't wear high heels often.

1127
00:45:12,356 --> 00:45:13,386
(They check again.)

1128
00:45:13,386 --> 00:45:15,786
(The foot is angry.)

1129
00:45:15,786 --> 00:45:17,656
- I'm sure. - It's certain.

1130
00:45:17,656 --> 00:45:20,186
Shouldn't you hang a sign that says, "Don't touch"?

1131
00:45:20,856 --> 00:45:22,726
(They're getting curious who is in the 2nd house.)

1132
00:45:22,726 --> 00:45:24,786
- Let's move to the third house. - Let's go.

1133
00:45:24,786 --> 00:45:26,886
We're looking forward.

1134
00:45:26,886 --> 00:45:28,486
- Excuse me. - It must be a guest.

1135
00:45:28,486 --> 00:45:29,686
Please show us your foot.

1136
00:45:30,026 --> 00:45:32,126
- Show us your foot. - Your foot.

1137
00:45:32,126 --> 00:45:34,686
(Show us your foot.)

1138
00:45:35,356 --> 00:45:38,956
(The 3rd person shows her foot.)

1139
00:45:40,756 --> 00:45:42,226
(It's tanned.)

1140
00:45:42,226 --> 00:45:43,286
It's tanned.

1141
00:45:43,286 --> 00:45:44,326
It's very dark.

1142
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:46,426
The foot is tanned.

1143
00:45:46,426 --> 00:45:48,226
Is it Beyonce?

1144
00:45:48,226 --> 00:45:50,526
- Beyonce? - The foot is small.

1145
00:45:50,726 --> 00:45:53,726
She's wearing very fancy nail polish.

1146
00:45:53,926 --> 00:45:55,456
- It must be a singer. - Stick out your foot farther.

1147
00:45:55,456 --> 00:45:58,256
As Jong Kook said, she must be a singer.

1148
00:45:58,826 --> 00:46:00,386
- Hyo Lyn. - I don't think so.

1149
00:46:00,486 --> 00:46:01,586
She's tanned.

1150
00:46:01,586 --> 00:46:03,926
One of the people who have a tan is...

1151
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:05,786
Jo Hye Ryun.

1152
00:46:05,786 --> 00:46:07,756
- She has a tan. - Right.

1153
00:46:07,756 --> 00:46:09,256
- You're right. - You're right.

1154
00:46:09,256 --> 00:46:11,026
- Is it Hye Ryun? - It's her.

1155
00:46:11,026 --> 00:46:13,656
This foot is...

1156
00:46:13,656 --> 00:46:15,156
quite chubby.

1157
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:16,926
- It's... - It looks heavy.

1158
00:46:16,926 --> 00:46:19,726
I think the person is a bit older.

1159
00:46:19,726 --> 00:46:20,856
It's a very small foot.

1160
00:46:23,526 --> 00:46:25,926
(Has Jae Seok found the answer?)

1161
00:46:25,926 --> 00:46:27,356
- Is it Sa Yeon? - Is it Sa Yeon?

1162
00:46:27,356 --> 00:46:28,626
No way.

1163
00:46:28,626 --> 00:46:29,656
(I'm here, boys.)

1164
00:46:29,656 --> 00:46:31,386
She's trying to deceive us.

1165
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:33,786
Judging from her foot,

1166
00:46:33,786 --> 00:46:36,626
- she must be a bit older. - Exactly.

1167
00:46:36,626 --> 00:46:39,486
She must be at least 41 to 42 years old.

1168
00:46:39,486 --> 00:46:41,156
(Seok Jin takes a guess.)

1169
00:46:41,156 --> 00:46:42,426
(Shaking)

1170
00:46:42,426 --> 00:46:44,586
The foot is shaking. She's laughing.

1171
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:47,256
Seok Jin said she would be 41, and she's laughing.

1172
00:46:47,256 --> 00:46:48,686
Aren't you 41 years old?

1173
00:46:48,686 --> 00:46:52,056
Let me summarize what we've been saying.

1174
00:46:52,126 --> 00:46:54,256
- She's a bit older. - She's older.

1175
00:46:54,256 --> 00:46:56,426
- She takes care of her health. - She likes to work out.

1176
00:46:56,426 --> 00:46:58,656
She's healthy.

1177
00:46:58,656 --> 00:47:00,986
Who do you think it is?

1178
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:02,526
- Jo Hye Ryun. - Jo Hye Ryun.

1179
00:47:02,526 --> 00:47:04,356
All right. 1, 2, 3.

1180
00:47:04,356 --> 00:47:05,526
- Jo Hye Ryun. - Jo Hye Ryun.

1181
00:47:05,526 --> 00:47:07,586
(The third person is Jo Hye Ryun.)

1182
00:47:07,586 --> 00:47:09,386
(She's laughing.)

1183
00:47:09,386 --> 00:47:12,286
Number 1 is So Min, number 2 is Ji Hyo,

1184
00:47:12,286 --> 00:47:13,986
- and number 3 is Hye Ryun. - And number 3 is Hye Ryun.

1185
00:47:14,256 --> 00:47:15,626
You're so good.

1186
00:47:15,626 --> 00:47:17,456
After hearing Hye Ryun's name, I can't think of anyone else.

1187
00:47:17,486 --> 00:47:21,526
- Right. - Here's the second hint.

1188
00:47:21,526 --> 00:47:23,426
We already have the answer.

1189
00:47:23,426 --> 00:47:25,626
- It's Hye Ryun. - Just to be sure.

1190
00:47:25,626 --> 00:47:28,756
- This time, it's sound. - Sound?

1191
00:47:29,086 --> 00:47:32,886
We'll let you hear their laughter.

1192
00:47:33,086 --> 00:47:36,256
Guess which one is the guest's.

1193
00:47:36,786 --> 00:47:38,756
(Number 1)

1194
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:40,056
(Laughing)

1195
00:47:40,056 --> 00:47:41,626
- It's So Min. - I'm not sure.

1196
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:43,556
- I'm not sure. - It's So Min.

1197
00:47:43,556 --> 00:47:45,486
Don't pretend you know.

1198
00:47:45,486 --> 00:47:47,186
Let's listen to number two.

1199
00:47:47,186 --> 00:47:48,326
Number two.

1200
00:47:48,886 --> 00:47:49,886
(Laughing)

1201
00:47:49,886 --> 00:47:51,756
- It's Ji Hyo. - It's Ji Hyo.

1202
00:47:52,686 --> 00:47:55,226
- It's Ji Hyo. - It's Ji Hyo.

1203
00:47:55,226 --> 00:47:56,526
(I can tell from the laughter.)

1204
00:47:56,526 --> 00:47:57,656
- It's Ji Hyo. - Excuse me.

1205
00:47:57,726 --> 00:47:59,556
Don't pretend you can tell from the laughter.

1206
00:47:59,956 --> 00:48:01,386
We all know.

1207
00:48:01,386 --> 00:48:03,686
He's acting like he's close with her.

1208
00:48:04,886 --> 00:48:06,186
- It's Ji Hyo. - How do you know?

1209
00:48:06,186 --> 00:48:08,086
Let me hear number one again.

1210
00:48:08,086 --> 00:48:09,256
Number one.

1211
00:48:10,086 --> 00:48:11,956
It's So Min.

1212
00:48:11,956 --> 00:48:13,586
(It's So Min.)

1213
00:48:13,586 --> 00:48:15,586
- It's So Min. - We already knew.

1214
00:48:15,586 --> 00:48:17,586
- We all knew. - It's So Min.

1215
00:48:17,586 --> 00:48:19,326
- What is this? - Let's hear number three.

1216
00:48:19,326 --> 00:48:21,086
- Let's hear number three. - Guess this one right.

1217
00:48:21,086 --> 00:48:22,356
Let me try.

1218
00:48:22,356 --> 00:48:24,656
(Laughing)

1219
00:48:24,656 --> 00:48:26,226
It's Hyo Lyn.

1220
00:48:26,226 --> 00:48:27,426
- It's Hyo Lyn. - It's Hyo Lyn.

1221
00:48:27,426 --> 00:48:29,526
It's either Jessi or Hyo Lyn.

1222
00:48:29,526 --> 00:48:31,326
- It's not Jessi. - It's definitely...

1223
00:48:31,326 --> 00:48:33,226
- It's Hyo Lyn. - Hyo Lyn.

1224
00:48:33,226 --> 00:48:36,486
(Is Hyo Lyn here?)

1225
00:48:36,886 --> 00:48:39,886
Jong Kook talked about her dream girl two weeks ago.

1226
00:48:39,886 --> 00:48:41,056
What?

1227
00:48:41,056 --> 00:48:42,956
- Unconsciously... - What?

1228
00:48:43,156 --> 00:48:45,526
He likes tanned girls with thick thighs.

1229
00:48:45,526 --> 00:48:47,356
- That's Hyo Lyn. - No.

1230
00:48:47,356 --> 00:48:48,856
- Hyo Lyn! - Hyo Lyn!

1231
00:48:48,856 --> 00:48:50,156
(Jong Kook's dream girl was revealed.)

1232
00:48:50,726 --> 00:48:53,086
He likes healthy-looking women.

1233
00:48:53,086 --> 00:48:55,056
- Of course. I like Hyo Lyn. - We've talked about her.

1234
00:48:55,056 --> 00:48:57,126
Hyo Lyn is amazing.

1235
00:48:58,086 --> 00:49:01,686
(Hyo Lyn, are you there?)

1236
00:49:01,686 --> 00:49:03,286
Hyo Lyn is amazing.

1237
00:49:03,486 --> 00:49:05,926
It's time to make a final choice.

1238
00:49:06,086 --> 00:49:07,486
Male members,

1239
00:49:07,886 --> 00:49:10,886
please stand in front of the house you think the guest is in.

1240
00:49:11,056 --> 00:49:12,956
If more than two members choose the same house,

1241
00:49:12,956 --> 00:49:15,926
the female member in the house will choose the team members.

1242
00:49:16,156 --> 00:49:17,456
If you're not chosen,

1243
00:49:17,456 --> 00:49:19,356
you'll have to stand in front of another house...

1244
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:20,926
to get into a team.

1245
00:49:20,926 --> 00:49:23,886
Should we get started?

1246
00:49:23,886 --> 00:49:25,226
- Okay. - Let's start.

1247
00:49:25,226 --> 00:49:27,156
We have no choice.

1248
00:49:27,156 --> 00:49:28,656
We have to go to the third house.

1249
00:49:28,656 --> 00:49:30,386
- We have to. - We have no choice.

1250
00:49:30,386 --> 00:49:32,726
Then it'll be too competitive.

1251
00:49:32,726 --> 00:49:34,586
The guest will choose her members.

1252
00:49:34,586 --> 00:49:36,026
- Are you sure? - Yes.

1253
00:49:36,026 --> 00:49:38,256
(I want to go to the 3rd house too.)

1254
00:49:38,256 --> 00:49:41,226
(Why are you hesitating?)

1255
00:49:41,226 --> 00:49:43,486
(The lady in the 2nd house lures Jae Seok.)

1256
00:49:43,486 --> 00:49:45,726
Jae Seok is being lured.

1257
00:49:46,156 --> 00:49:48,256
Ji Hyo and So Min are attractive,

1258
00:49:48,426 --> 00:49:49,686
but they're not my type.

1259
00:49:49,856 --> 00:49:52,626
I can seduce Jae Seok with one finger.

1260
00:49:52,886 --> 00:49:55,026
(I can seduce Jae Seok with one finger.)

1261
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,586
Hey, don't be absurd.

1262
00:49:57,586 --> 00:49:58,956
Be careful.

1263
00:49:58,956 --> 00:50:01,056
(Jae Seok was confident he wouldn't fall for her.)

1264
00:50:01,056 --> 00:50:03,426
- Jae Seok is being lured. - Look at him.

1265
00:50:03,426 --> 00:50:04,686
With one finger.

1266
00:50:04,686 --> 00:50:06,656
- With one finger... - He's being lured.

1267
00:50:06,656 --> 00:50:08,056
My pride is hurt.

1268
00:50:08,056 --> 00:50:09,126
What are you doing?

1269
00:50:09,126 --> 00:50:11,156
Do you mean you can seduce me with one finger?

1270
00:50:11,886 --> 00:50:13,726
(Of course.)

1271
00:50:13,726 --> 00:50:16,956
Do you mean you can seduce me with one finger?

1272
00:50:19,156 --> 00:50:21,556
- My goodness. - Stay here.

1273
00:50:21,556 --> 00:50:23,586
- Stay here. - I can't believe this.

1274
00:50:23,586 --> 00:50:24,726
He's been seduced.

1275
00:50:24,726 --> 00:50:26,486
With one finger...

1276
00:50:26,486 --> 00:50:28,756
Ji Hyo, you've seduced him.

1277
00:50:28,756 --> 00:50:30,286
I can't believe this.

1278
00:50:32,026 --> 00:50:34,556
(Ji Hyo seduces Jae Seok with one finger.)

1279
00:50:35,356 --> 00:50:37,286
- Ji Hyo. - I can't believe this.

1280
00:50:37,286 --> 00:50:40,056
(I'm free today.)

1281
00:50:41,456 --> 00:50:42,986
Jae Seok is blushing.

1282
00:50:42,986 --> 00:50:44,026
Okay!

1283
00:50:44,026 --> 00:50:45,126
(Jae Seok gives in.)

1284
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:46,386
Okay, Ji Hyo.

1285
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,556
Okay, Ji Hyo.

1286
00:50:48,556 --> 00:50:49,956
(Jae Seok is too easy.)

1287
00:50:49,956 --> 00:50:51,386
Okay!

1288
00:50:51,386 --> 00:50:52,956
(A foot sticks out.)

1289
00:50:53,056 --> 00:50:54,586
What is this?

1290
00:50:54,586 --> 00:50:55,626
What is that?

1291
00:50:55,626 --> 00:50:56,956
Are you trying to...

1292
00:50:57,056 --> 00:50:59,026
What are you doing, So Min?

1293
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:01,356
Do you want me to hold it?

1294
00:51:01,856 --> 00:51:03,356
Guys, come here.

1295
00:51:04,156 --> 00:51:05,856
So Min can do this.

1296
00:51:06,126 --> 00:51:07,956
Her toes are long.

1297
00:51:07,956 --> 00:51:09,286
- They're long. - Gosh.

1298
00:51:09,286 --> 00:51:11,026
Jae Seok is so easy.

1299
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,456
You can seduce him even with your feet.

1300
00:51:13,456 --> 00:51:14,726
A finger...

1301
00:51:15,386 --> 00:51:16,986
and toes...

1302
00:51:16,986 --> 00:51:18,986
That foot is attractive.

1303
00:51:20,056 --> 00:51:21,556
(Hold it.)

1304
00:51:21,556 --> 00:51:22,586
(I won't hesitate.)

1305
00:51:22,586 --> 00:51:23,956
I'm here.

1306
00:51:24,226 --> 00:51:25,626
It's over now.

1307
00:51:25,786 --> 00:51:26,856
It's over.

1308
00:51:27,026 --> 00:51:28,156
Is it over?

1309
00:51:28,326 --> 00:51:29,626
Is it over?

1310
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:30,926
It's over.

1311
00:51:30,926 --> 00:51:32,686
- I was just trying to be funny. - It's over.

1312
00:51:32,686 --> 00:51:34,026
It's over.

1313
00:51:34,326 --> 00:51:36,626
- It's over. - It looks weird.

1314
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:38,826
I don't even touch my wife's.

1315
00:51:38,826 --> 00:51:39,886
It's over.

1316
00:51:39,886 --> 00:51:41,526
Don't make me look weird.

1317
00:51:41,526 --> 00:51:42,856
- I was just trying to be funny. - It's over.

1318
00:51:42,856 --> 00:51:44,426
- I was just working hard. - It's over.

1319
00:51:44,886 --> 00:51:46,126
You held it.

1320
00:51:46,456 --> 00:51:49,026
You two stay there.

1321
00:51:49,156 --> 00:51:51,256
You have...

1322
00:51:51,526 --> 00:51:54,556
Se Chan, Jong Kook,

1323
00:51:54,926 --> 00:51:56,986
and Seok Jin here.

1324
00:51:56,986 --> 00:51:59,826
Is there someone you want to keep?

1325
00:52:01,156 --> 00:52:02,786
- Yes. - Yes?

1326
00:52:03,026 --> 00:52:04,026
Who is it?

1327
00:52:04,856 --> 00:52:06,686
Jong Kook.

1328
00:52:06,726 --> 00:52:09,556
(The mysterious lady chooses Jong Kook.)

1329
00:52:10,356 --> 00:52:11,486
Jong Kook.

1330
00:52:11,486 --> 00:52:13,486
- You'll fall in love today. - You'll fall in love.

1331
00:52:13,656 --> 00:52:15,656
You'll fall in love today.

1332
00:52:15,726 --> 00:52:17,256
Jong Kook.

1333
00:52:17,256 --> 00:52:18,256
Excuse me.

1334
00:52:18,256 --> 00:52:19,256
Yes?

1335
00:52:19,256 --> 00:52:21,556
(Do you want to say something?)

1336
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:23,286
Lucky you, Jong Kook.

1337
00:52:24,526 --> 00:52:25,626
What?

1338
00:52:25,626 --> 00:52:27,156
Be quiet.

1339
00:52:27,156 --> 00:52:29,356
- Ma'am. - Ji Hyo, stay quiet.

1340
00:52:29,356 --> 00:52:31,426
(It was silly of me.)

1341
00:52:31,526 --> 00:52:32,586
Stay quiet.

1342
00:52:33,456 --> 00:52:35,826
Don't say anything. Stay quiet.

1343
00:52:36,556 --> 00:52:38,456
(Jae Seok sticks his head in.)

1344
00:52:38,456 --> 00:52:40,956
Don't say anything when it's not about you.

1345
00:52:41,026 --> 00:52:43,026
It's Ji Hyo. I checked.

1346
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:44,056
You're not supposed to do that.

1347
00:52:44,056 --> 00:52:45,556
(It's definitely Ji Hyo.)

1348
00:52:45,556 --> 00:52:47,556
What? It's Ji Hyo.

1349
00:52:47,556 --> 00:52:49,486
It is Ji Hyo.

1350
00:52:49,486 --> 00:52:50,926
(As everyone expected, it's Ji Hyo.)

1351
00:52:50,926 --> 00:52:54,686
You can choose who should stay.

1352
00:52:54,686 --> 00:52:56,426
For example, you can say, "Seok Jin, leave."

1353
00:52:56,556 --> 00:52:58,356
"Se Chan, leave."

1354
00:52:58,356 --> 00:53:00,786
It's really okay. Tell one person to leave.

1355
00:53:00,786 --> 00:53:02,956
One, two, three.

1356
00:53:02,956 --> 00:53:04,526
(Who will be sent away?)

1357
00:53:05,886 --> 00:53:07,886
Bye, Se Chan.

1358
00:53:07,926 --> 00:53:10,686
(She bids farewell to Se Chan.)

1359
00:53:10,726 --> 00:53:12,586
(Happy, sad)

1360
00:53:12,586 --> 00:53:14,956
- I'll see you in a while. - Is she sending Se Chan away?

1361
00:53:14,956 --> 00:53:16,686
Is she older than me?

1362
00:53:16,686 --> 00:53:18,126
- Come here. - Who is it?

1363
00:53:18,126 --> 00:53:19,286
Se Chan, come here.

1364
00:53:19,286 --> 00:53:20,856
- What's with you? - Se Chan, come here.

1365
00:53:20,856 --> 00:53:22,826
(Ji Hyo seduces him with her finger again.)

1366
00:53:22,826 --> 00:53:24,526
It won't work.

1367
00:53:25,726 --> 00:53:27,056
She sent Se Chan away.

1368
00:53:27,056 --> 00:53:29,486
- All right. - Is it really Hyo Lyn?

1369
00:53:29,486 --> 00:53:32,356
Three teams have been formed.

1370
00:53:32,356 --> 00:53:35,226
- Number one... She's already out. - She's already out.

1371
00:53:37,156 --> 00:53:38,656
So Min.

1372
00:53:38,656 --> 00:53:40,486
(So Min, Kwang Soo, and Haha are a team.)

1373
00:53:41,126 --> 00:53:43,026
So Min, your feet are so big.

1374
00:53:43,026 --> 00:53:44,356
My feet are very long.

1375
00:53:44,356 --> 00:53:46,956
- Now... - Ji Hyo.

1376
00:53:46,956 --> 00:53:50,556
(Ji Hyo, Jae Seok, and Se Chan are a team.)

1377
00:53:50,556 --> 00:53:52,286
She's the finger girl.

1378
00:53:52,286 --> 00:53:53,926
She can seduce guys with one finger.

1379
00:53:53,926 --> 00:53:55,486
- She's the finger girl. - With just one finger.

1380
00:53:55,826 --> 00:53:57,186
Now, the third house.

1381
00:53:57,186 --> 00:53:58,356
- Who is it? - Is it Hyo Lyn?

1382
00:53:58,356 --> 00:53:59,556
I think it's Hyo Lyn.

1383
00:53:59,556 --> 00:54:02,186
- It'd be so funny if it's Hye Ryun. - No, it's not Hye Ryun.

1384
00:54:02,186 --> 00:54:04,086
- Please come out. - Please come out.

1385
00:54:04,086 --> 00:54:08,786
(You with tanned feet,)

1386
00:54:08,786 --> 00:54:13,056
(could you please come out?)

1387
00:54:13,056 --> 00:54:16,626
(Jong Kook's dream girl, Hyo Lyn, is here.)

1388
00:54:16,626 --> 00:54:17,686
Jong Kook.

1389
00:54:18,056 --> 00:54:19,656
(Happy)

1390
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:21,586
It was Hyo Lyn.

1391
00:54:21,586 --> 00:54:23,586
Hyo Lyn is so nice.

1392
00:54:23,586 --> 00:54:25,126
It was Hyo Lyn.

1393
00:54:25,826 --> 00:54:27,886
- You two look great together. - They do.

1394
00:54:27,886 --> 00:54:29,486
- They have similar skin tones. - By the way,

1395
00:54:29,726 --> 00:54:31,226
Hyo Lyn once...

1396
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,386
- danced with Gary. - You're right.

1397
00:54:32,386 --> 00:54:34,056
They danced together.

1398
00:54:34,056 --> 00:54:35,526
They were like a South American couple.

1399
00:54:35,526 --> 00:54:37,856
- It was an incredible dance. - Exactly.

1400
00:54:38,656 --> 00:54:42,386
(This dance by Hyo Lyn caused some stir.)

1401
00:54:42,386 --> 00:54:43,726
What's that?

1402
00:54:44,586 --> 00:54:47,026
(What's that?)

1403
00:54:47,026 --> 00:54:49,856
(They all panicked.)

1404
00:54:50,526 --> 00:54:55,086
(This sexy dance made many men fall in love with her.)

1405
00:54:56,356 --> 00:54:58,786
Since then, Jong Kook started taking interest in her.

1406
00:54:58,786 --> 00:55:01,586
- Is that right? - Yes. He pretends otherwise.

1407
00:55:01,586 --> 00:55:02,986
(He's been watching her from afar.)

1408
00:55:03,756 --> 00:55:05,556
Now that I have a look...

1409
00:55:05,556 --> 00:55:07,286
(If these two are an item...)

1410
00:55:07,286 --> 00:55:09,656
- You're going around with them. - What does that make me?

1411
00:55:09,656 --> 00:55:11,586
He's their aide.

1412
00:55:11,586 --> 00:55:14,326
- I get why you picked me. - He's the youngest.

1413
00:55:14,326 --> 00:55:15,986
He's like Sebastian.

1414
00:55:16,386 --> 00:55:17,926
You can order me around. I'll do everything for you.

1415
00:55:17,926 --> 00:55:21,026
- He's Alfred. - You can order me around.

1416
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:23,286
(Is he a butler that serves this couple?)

1417
00:55:23,656 --> 00:55:25,486
You don't have to do anything. I'll do everything today.

1418
00:55:25,486 --> 00:55:27,586
- Can you get a costume for him? - He's like...

1419
00:55:27,586 --> 00:55:29,386
- Alfred from "Batman". - Can you get something?

1420
00:55:29,386 --> 00:55:32,926
When you go on a vacation, you take various items...

1421
00:55:32,926 --> 00:55:34,926
but you usually forget things like wet wipes.

1422
00:55:35,086 --> 00:55:37,126
(He's like wet wipes.)

1423
00:55:38,026 --> 00:55:39,426
- Don't say that to him. - Hey.

1424
00:55:39,426 --> 00:55:40,426
(That was mean.)

1425
00:55:40,986 --> 00:55:44,186
What's wrong with that? There's nothing wrong with that.

1426
00:55:44,186 --> 00:55:46,556
They're very important to have.

1427
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:50,326
- When you go on trips... - You need them but you forget.

1428
00:55:50,326 --> 00:55:52,486
You guys are meaner for laughing along.

1429
00:55:52,486 --> 00:55:54,286
Wipes are so important.

1430
00:55:54,286 --> 00:55:56,186
(It's break time after selecting teams.)

1431
00:55:57,056 --> 00:55:58,856
It looks pretty.

1432
00:55:59,586 --> 00:56:03,156
- This is pretty cool. - What's so cool about it?

1433
00:56:03,156 --> 00:56:05,286
- It has a nice color. - It's insane.

1434
00:56:05,286 --> 00:56:06,826
- Okay. - It worked.

1435
00:56:06,986 --> 00:56:09,586
(It saved your silly face.)

1436
00:56:09,586 --> 00:56:10,656
(They set up an iris scanner.)

00:56:24,137 --> 00:56:25,137
(Something falls.)

1445
00:56:25,137 --> 00:56:28,077
- Oh, dear. It fell. - Let's get started.

1446
00:56:28,477 --> 00:56:30,477
(Here you go, Hyo Lyn.)

1447
00:56:31,037 --> 00:56:34,307
(He's taking care of her. What's going on between them?)

1448
00:56:34,937 --> 00:56:35,895
(Excuse me.)

1449
00:56:35,895 --> 00:56:37,035
Her microphone fell off.

1450
00:56:37,034 --> 00:56:39,794
He's so nice to her.

1451
00:56:39,794 --> 00:56:41,064
It fell off.

1452
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,764
(Something's going on between these two.)

1453
00:56:43,294 --> 00:56:44,294
(Seok Jin is nice to her too.)

1454
00:56:44,294 --> 00:56:46,394
- Okay. - It fell.

1455
00:56:46,394 --> 00:56:48,064
(She turns down his kindness.)

1456
00:56:48,294 --> 00:56:51,294
- Seok Jin wanted to do it for her. - She refused him.

1457
00:56:51,294 --> 00:56:53,894
- Don't you usually say yes? - She pushed him away.

1458
00:56:53,894 --> 00:56:55,594
Don't do that to him, Hyo Lyn.

1459
00:56:55,594 --> 00:56:57,334
- I understand. - Women are...

1460
00:56:57,334 --> 00:57:00,564
He's like the wet wipes of this team.

1461
00:57:00,594 --> 00:57:02,694
- I'll wipe everything. - He's a tissue.

1462
00:57:02,694 --> 00:57:04,694
If you get something on you, please call me.

1463
00:57:04,694 --> 00:57:07,694
I wonder how much more he'll take this.

1464
00:57:08,064 --> 00:57:10,134
- He's going to blow up once. - He looks...

1465
00:57:10,134 --> 00:57:13,094
He looks a bit upset. Look at his face.

1466
00:57:13,094 --> 00:57:14,994
- Just a bit. - No, I'm okay.

1467
00:57:14,994 --> 00:57:17,334
- By the way, Seok Jin did get... - You're important.

1468
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:20,764
- mad at me once years ago. - Because you made fun of him?

1469
00:57:20,764 --> 00:57:23,434
Yes, he got mad and left.

1470
00:57:23,434 --> 00:57:27,094
The next day, he was like, "Hi, Jae Seok."

1471
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,134
- He forgot. - I forget easily.

1472
00:57:30,134 --> 00:57:32,134
I forget too easily. I forget about my enemies.

1473
00:57:32,134 --> 00:57:35,094
That's good. He's going to live long.

1474
00:57:35,094 --> 00:57:37,864
- I don't worry too much. - Exactly.

1475
00:57:37,894 --> 00:57:40,994
Let's get started. The first team mission is...

1476
00:57:41,034 --> 00:57:43,294
Running Marble Part Two.

1477
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:44,994
(This is their first mission.)

1478
00:57:46,264 --> 00:57:47,894
(They're playing Running Marble from last week again?)

1479
00:57:47,894 --> 00:57:50,234
- What's that? - They brought it back.

1480
00:57:50,264 --> 00:57:52,894
We won't be going anywhere, right? This makes me anxious.

1481
00:57:52,894 --> 00:57:54,594
They took my passport.

1482
00:57:54,694 --> 00:57:56,794
What's this? Are we going to Thailand?

1483
00:57:56,794 --> 00:57:59,064
- Are we leaving again? - No way.

1484
00:58:00,294 --> 00:58:06,264
(Last week, they went abroad for a day.)

1485
00:58:06,264 --> 00:58:10,394
(Are they going to a farther destination today?)

1486
00:58:10,764 --> 00:58:13,664
- You know the rules, right? - Yes.

1487
00:58:13,664 --> 00:58:15,494
Roll the die, buy land,

1488
00:58:15,494 --> 00:58:18,394
and the team that goes bankrupt loses. It's simple.

1489
00:58:18,534 --> 00:58:21,864
The order you go is obviously important.

1490
00:58:21,864 --> 00:58:26,194
We'll play a simple game to decide who goes first.

1491
00:58:26,194 --> 00:58:27,264
It's better to go first.

1492
00:58:27,264 --> 00:58:30,894
In order to choose who goes first, we'll play our favorite game...

1493
00:58:30,894 --> 00:58:34,534
called Be Irrelevant. It's also known as Jee Seok Jin game.

1494
00:58:34,534 --> 00:58:36,034
Why is it called so?

1495
00:58:36,034 --> 00:58:38,794
- Just leave it. - His words are usually irrelevant.

1496
00:58:38,864 --> 00:58:40,864
He got mad last time when I told him he's irrelevant.

1497
00:58:40,864 --> 00:58:42,894
- He said he never was. - He wanted to play again.

1498
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:45,034
You said it's Jee Seok Jin game, and he agreed.

1499
00:58:45,034 --> 00:58:48,964
Our staff members are great.

1500
00:58:48,964 --> 00:58:51,164
You know another funny thing about Seok Jin?

1501
00:58:51,264 --> 00:58:54,494
When I used to talk about his nose, he would call me...

1502
00:58:54,494 --> 00:58:57,864
- and tell me not to mention it. - Really?

1503
00:58:57,864 --> 00:59:01,664
He was worried that people would only talk about his nose.

1504
00:59:01,664 --> 00:59:03,264
Did you listen to him on his radio show?

1505
00:59:03,334 --> 00:59:06,334
"Hello, this is DJ Big Nose."

1506
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,294
(This is DJ Big Nose.)

1507
00:59:08,594 --> 00:59:10,994
Whenever he does this,

1508
00:59:10,994 --> 00:59:13,134
- He's so delicate. - I get so disappointed.

1509
00:59:13,134 --> 00:59:15,964
- That makes me disappointed. - Exactly.

1510
00:59:16,164 --> 00:59:17,494
Jee Seok Jin game, it is.

1511
00:59:17,494 --> 00:59:20,234
Hyo Lyn may not know the rules so let me explain.

1512
00:59:20,334 --> 00:59:22,534
Each team has to give an irrelevant answer to my question...

1513
00:59:22,534 --> 00:59:25,764
three times in a row. We'll decide who goes first...

1514
00:59:25,764 --> 00:59:28,194
depending on which team gets the most questions.

1515
00:59:28,194 --> 00:59:30,694
- You can't make any sense. - Let me try it on Seok Jin.

1516
00:59:30,994 --> 00:59:33,494
- What do you want to eat right now? - Frogs.

1517
00:59:33,494 --> 00:59:36,194
- This is wrong. - You shouldn't do that.

1518
00:59:36,194 --> 00:59:37,434
(Why is he doing well suddenly?)

1519
00:59:37,434 --> 00:59:40,764
- This is wrong. - It has to make no sense.

1520
00:59:40,764 --> 00:59:41,764
Let me try it on Haha.

1521
00:59:41,764 --> 00:59:44,294
Do you have to answer as soon as you hear the question?

1522
00:59:44,294 --> 00:59:45,594
It has to make sense.

1523
00:59:45,594 --> 00:59:46,664
Did you get good grades in school?

1524
00:59:46,664 --> 00:59:49,164
- You don't look good in red cap. - That's it.

1525
00:59:49,164 --> 00:59:50,664
I don't think I'll know what to say.

1526
00:59:50,664 --> 00:59:52,534
It's a xylophone battle.

1527
00:59:52,534 --> 00:59:54,164
Shouldn't Seok Jin take it if it's his game?

1528
00:59:54,164 --> 00:59:56,494
- But I'm good at this. - You're good at it.

1529
00:59:56,494 --> 00:59:58,534
- But it's my game. - Still, you can't do anything.

1530
00:59:58,534 --> 01:00:01,394
- Hey. I'm a host too. - It's the truth.

1531
01:00:01,394 --> 01:00:03,794
- Listen to Jong Kook. - You're the old host.

1532
01:00:03,794 --> 01:00:05,934
- He's good at striking it. - I'm good with it.

1533
01:00:06,164 --> 01:00:07,894
- Go ahead. - I don't think I can do this.

1534
01:00:08,264 --> 01:00:09,334
Ready.

1535
01:00:09,594 --> 01:00:10,634
You can do it.

1536
01:00:10,694 --> 01:00:12,764
(Let's go, Hyo Lyn.)

1537
01:00:12,764 --> 01:00:15,164
Please speak up.

1538
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:16,594
Ready, set, go.

1539
01:00:16,594 --> 01:00:19,294
- What do you want to eat right now? - Shoes.

1540
01:00:19,294 --> 01:00:21,534
- What is your guiding principle? - Hats.

1541
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:22,964
- Can't you eat shoes? - What?

1542
01:00:22,964 --> 01:00:24,764
- You can't eat shoes. - You can't eat shoes.

1543
01:00:24,764 --> 01:00:27,194
- You can't eat shoes. - How do you eat shoes?

1544
01:00:27,194 --> 01:00:28,494
(He strikes the xylophone.)

1545
01:00:28,664 --> 01:00:30,964
- You can't eat shoes. - I had it for breakfast.

1546
01:00:31,234 --> 01:00:33,364
- I had it for breakfast. - It's pretty good.

1547
01:00:33,364 --> 01:00:36,064
- It's good. - It's great for snacking.

1548
01:00:36,064 --> 01:00:38,994
There are scenes in cartoons where they roast shoes.

1549
01:00:40,764 --> 01:00:42,494
(Goodness)

1550
01:00:42,494 --> 01:00:45,234
(They actually do eat shoes.)

1551
01:00:45,664 --> 01:00:47,264
(She cracks up.)

1552
01:00:47,264 --> 01:00:51,164
It's in "Mickey Mouse". There's a scene where they roast shoes.

1553
01:00:51,164 --> 01:00:53,264
I don't eat them often but I do sometimes.

1554
01:00:53,294 --> 01:00:54,434
(Fine. Forget it.)

1555
01:00:54,434 --> 01:00:56,234
- Let's go again. - That was good.

1556
01:00:56,234 --> 01:00:57,734
- We're being lenient. - Ready.

1557
01:00:57,864 --> 01:00:59,334
- What should I do? - You get taller from eating shoes.

1558
01:00:59,334 --> 01:01:01,034
What do you want to do during your free time?

1559
01:01:01,034 --> 01:01:02,394
- Phone. - What do you do...

1560
01:01:02,434 --> 01:01:03,894
- Phone? - It's wrong.

1561
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:06,294
- Why? - You play with your phone.

1562
01:01:06,294 --> 01:01:08,494
- You want to use your phone. - You're thinking too much.

1563
01:01:08,494 --> 01:01:10,694
- You do play with your phone. - Exactly.

1564
01:01:11,194 --> 01:01:14,394
(It's great to go on your phone while you're lying in bed.)

1565
01:01:15,534 --> 01:01:17,294
This is so difficult.

1566
01:01:18,094 --> 01:01:20,164
- It makes sense. - We can't do anything.

1567
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:21,694
None of it works.

1568
01:01:21,694 --> 01:01:23,694
What do you want to do during your free time? Red. That works.

1569
01:01:23,694 --> 01:01:25,794
- It works. - That does work.

1570
01:01:25,794 --> 01:01:29,494
- Do we get another chance? - No, stop it.

1571
01:01:29,494 --> 01:01:30,494
(I was just asking.)

1572
01:01:30,494 --> 01:01:32,694
- How many chances do you want? - I would have given it.

1573
01:01:32,694 --> 01:01:34,164
- You went five times. - I should have taken that.

1574
01:01:34,164 --> 01:01:36,494
- You'll be playing all day. - Stop it.

1575
01:01:36,494 --> 01:01:38,034
- That's old style. - I went too many times.

1576
01:01:38,034 --> 01:01:39,864
The xylophone should be given to the most generous.

1577
01:01:39,864 --> 01:01:41,394
That was enough.

1578
01:01:41,394 --> 01:01:43,664
Are you tearing up, Seok Jin?

1579
01:01:43,664 --> 01:01:45,034
(Are you crying?)

1580
01:01:45,834 --> 01:01:48,964
No, I poked myself in the eye.

1581
01:01:48,964 --> 01:01:51,694
- No. - Your eyes were glistening.

1582
01:01:51,694 --> 01:01:54,764
- Your tears were reflected. - I poked myself. I'm not crying.

1583
01:01:54,764 --> 01:01:57,164
- I'm strong. - Next.

1584
01:01:57,364 --> 01:01:59,864
- It's Jong Kook's turn. - Ready,

1585
01:02:00,434 --> 01:02:03,534
set, go. What do you usually lie about?

1586
01:02:03,534 --> 01:02:04,894
I go to an uninhabited island...

1587
01:02:04,934 --> 01:02:07,294
(What do you do in an uninhabited island?)

1588
01:02:08,264 --> 01:02:09,694
(He's flustered.)

1589
01:02:09,694 --> 01:02:10,994
(Hold on.)

1590
01:02:10,994 --> 01:02:13,394
- What do you do on an island? - Don't think.

1591
01:02:13,394 --> 01:02:16,434
- It makes you think. - What are you planning to do?

1592
01:02:16,434 --> 01:02:19,694
- Sorry? - You're so lustful.

1593
01:02:20,034 --> 01:02:21,534
You're cunning.

1594
01:02:21,534 --> 01:02:22,994
He met his ideal type.

1595
01:02:22,994 --> 01:02:25,534
It says island on the board.

1596
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:29,164
- I just read it. - These questions are much harder.

1597
01:02:29,164 --> 01:02:30,694
- It's harder. - It's been upgraded.

1598
01:02:30,694 --> 01:02:33,764
This will be fun to play on vacation or during company dinners.

1599
01:02:33,764 --> 01:02:36,164
- It'll be fun. - It's difficult not to lose.

1600
01:02:36,164 --> 01:02:38,334
- It'll be worse when you get drunk. - You know my role model is poop?

1601
01:02:38,334 --> 01:02:39,334
Really?

1602
01:02:39,694 --> 01:02:43,234
Because of this game, my role model is poop now.

1603
01:02:44,164 --> 01:02:48,294
(When he was asked who his role model was, he said poop.)

1604
01:02:48,294 --> 01:02:53,494
(His role model has a strong scent.)

1605
01:02:54,234 --> 01:02:55,694
(He smells.)

1606
01:02:55,694 --> 01:02:57,264
You have all failed.

1607
01:02:57,264 --> 01:02:59,964
Seok Jin's team loses Jee Seok Jin game.

1608
01:03:01,134 --> 01:03:02,964
It's your turn now.

1609
01:03:02,964 --> 01:03:04,594
(Give me the xylophone.)

1610
01:03:04,594 --> 01:03:06,394
I can take care of this.

1611
01:03:06,394 --> 01:03:09,694
- Hey. Fine, take it all. - We shouldn't have gone first.

1612
01:03:09,694 --> 01:03:12,034
- We should have started with you. - Let's go.

1613
01:03:12,034 --> 01:03:13,864
Ready, set, go.

1614
01:03:14,164 --> 01:03:16,194
- What do you do on a rainy day? - I want to go to Hawaii.

1615
01:03:16,664 --> 01:03:18,264
- Why? - That's wrong.

1616
01:03:19,034 --> 01:03:20,864
(You want to go to Hawaii on a rainy day?)

1617
01:03:20,894 --> 01:03:22,894
- On a rainy day? Come on. - Why?

1618
01:03:23,034 --> 01:03:25,064
- Hey! - What was that for?

1619
01:03:25,064 --> 01:03:26,834
- How does that make sense? - It does.

1620
01:03:26,834 --> 01:03:30,794
I'd eat pancakes at home. Who would go to Hawaii?

1621
01:03:30,794 --> 01:03:32,164
Who eats shoes?

1622
01:03:32,164 --> 01:03:33,334
You can go to Hawaii on a rainy day.

1623
01:03:33,334 --> 01:03:36,034
I've been to Hawaii on a rainy day.

1624
01:03:36,194 --> 01:03:38,034
- We admit it. He's out. - I admit it.

1625
01:03:38,334 --> 01:03:39,564
These questions are so difficult.

1626
01:03:39,564 --> 01:03:41,194
- They're so difficult. - They're scary.

1627
01:03:41,194 --> 01:03:43,934
How do you answer that question? It has to make no sense.

1628
01:03:43,934 --> 01:03:45,694
- Frogs. - Red.

1629
01:03:45,694 --> 01:03:47,194
- Frogs. - Frogs come out on rainy days.

1630
01:03:47,194 --> 01:03:48,394
They're asking what you want to do.

1631
01:03:48,394 --> 01:03:50,094
- You can do frogs. - How?

1632
01:03:50,094 --> 01:03:51,364
- You can hop like a frog. - It doesn't make sense.

1633
01:03:51,364 --> 01:03:53,664
How does that make sense?

1634
01:03:54,194 --> 01:03:57,564
- Hey. - Use your hands.

1635
01:03:57,734 --> 01:03:59,464
Don't use both.

1636
01:03:59,464 --> 01:04:02,694
- How does that make sense? - Don't use all your limbs.

1637
01:04:02,694 --> 01:04:03,894
It doesn't make any sense.

1638
01:04:03,894 --> 01:04:06,034
- It does make sense. - I want to do frogs.

1639
01:04:06,034 --> 01:04:07,264
- It makes sense. - It does.

1640
01:04:07,264 --> 01:04:09,294
Frogs. It makes sense.

1641
01:04:09,334 --> 01:04:11,634
Whose side are you on?

1642
01:04:11,864 --> 01:04:14,034
- Me? - We're wearing the same color.

1643
01:04:14,034 --> 01:04:16,694
(We're Team Yellow.)

1644
01:04:16,694 --> 01:04:19,094
Look at his cap. We're wearing the same color.

1645
01:04:19,094 --> 01:04:21,094
(Didn't you know? Jong Kook is on Team Red too.)

1646
01:04:21,094 --> 01:04:23,064
- We're a team. We're one. - He's on our team.

1647
01:04:23,064 --> 01:04:24,394
We're one.

1648
01:04:24,394 --> 01:04:25,934
I see.

1649
01:04:25,934 --> 01:04:27,034
Ji Hyo is next.

1650
01:04:27,034 --> 01:04:28,264
- I have to find something. - Pay attention.

1651
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:30,634
- What? - Just daydream like you always do.

1652
01:04:31,064 --> 01:04:32,064
Set, go.

1653
01:04:32,064 --> 01:04:33,164
What do you want to say to Seok Jin?

1654
01:04:33,164 --> 01:04:34,364
The red light came on.

1655
01:04:34,364 --> 01:04:35,634
What is your nickname?

1656
01:04:35,994 --> 01:04:37,094
You.

1657
01:04:38,594 --> 01:04:40,694
(Me?)

1658
01:04:40,834 --> 01:04:41,894
You.

1659
01:04:43,234 --> 01:04:44,564
(That makes sense so that's wrong.)

1660
01:04:44,564 --> 01:04:46,664
- It's her nickname. - You.

1661
01:04:46,834 --> 01:04:48,094
(Her nickname is the Dangerous Producer.)

1662
01:04:48,094 --> 01:04:49,794
What was that?

1663
01:04:49,994 --> 01:04:52,164
- What was that, Ji Hyo? - Chang Min.

1664
01:04:52,164 --> 01:04:54,634
First question was fine. What was that?

1665
01:04:54,634 --> 01:04:56,094
Isn't the first one wrong?

1666
01:04:56,094 --> 01:04:57,134
- How? - Why?

1667
01:04:57,134 --> 01:04:58,364
- She can say that to me. - What she wants to say to you?

1668
01:04:58,364 --> 01:04:59,394
(It's wrong then.)

1669
01:04:59,394 --> 01:05:01,394
- Let's go again. - Can't you do it properly?

1670
01:05:01,394 --> 01:05:02,864
(Can't you do it properly?)

1671
01:05:02,864 --> 01:05:04,234
I did do it properly.

1672
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:06,194
- What was that for? - Strike it.

1673
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:07,434
- What was that? - Strike it.

1674
01:05:07,434 --> 01:05:10,364
- You better do good or else. - Fine.

1675
01:05:11,094 --> 01:05:12,394
- My gosh. - Good job.

1676
01:05:12,394 --> 01:05:14,494
- Should I not do anything? - You're so scary.

1677
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:17,094
You should win. Somebody should win.

1678
01:05:17,564 --> 01:05:19,134
I can make a person ring with sounds.

1679
01:05:19,134 --> 01:05:21,464
(Just watch.)

1680
01:05:21,664 --> 01:05:24,234
- Where would it ring from? - Have you heard it before?

1681
01:05:24,294 --> 01:05:26,764
Once you punch someone, your ears ring.

1682
01:05:27,194 --> 01:05:29,864
I've heard it before.

1683
01:05:30,394 --> 01:05:33,064
You have to think about it. You can't think about nothing.

1684
01:05:33,064 --> 01:05:34,464
- Can you take over, Haha? - Sure.

1685
01:05:35,834 --> 01:05:38,764
(Fine, I don't want it.)

1686
01:05:38,764 --> 01:05:40,264
- Don't even bother. - What?

1687
01:05:40,264 --> 01:05:42,334
- What's wrong? - Haha's good with it.

1688
01:05:42,694 --> 01:05:44,194
(Look at how Haha grabs it.)

1689
01:05:44,194 --> 01:05:45,364
- I'm good too. - Seok Jin.

1690
01:05:45,364 --> 01:05:48,534
I'm good too. This is my game.

1691
01:05:50,834 --> 01:05:53,664
(This is Jee Seok Jin game.)

1692
01:05:53,664 --> 01:05:55,194
(The xylophone is mine.)

1693
01:05:55,194 --> 01:05:56,734
Good job.

1694
01:05:56,894 --> 01:05:58,234
- I think he'll get it right. - It's okay.

1695
01:05:58,264 --> 01:05:59,994
Let's just accept it.

1696
01:06:00,634 --> 01:06:03,064
- I'll pay attention. - Let's go.

1697
01:06:03,064 --> 01:06:04,194
This will be fine.

1698
01:06:04,194 --> 01:06:05,664
- Set... - I already thought of an answer.

1699
01:06:06,294 --> 01:06:07,964
- I analysed this. - Ready.

1700
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,094
Set, go.

1701
01:06:10,094 --> 01:06:11,334
- What's in your fridge? - Paulownia tree.

1702
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:13,734
Paulownia tree.

1703
01:06:13,734 --> 01:06:15,094
(You have a paulownia tree at home?)

1704
01:06:15,094 --> 01:06:16,494
- You have a paulownia tree. - It's wrong.

1705
01:06:16,494 --> 01:06:17,664
He has a paulownia tree.

1706
01:06:17,664 --> 01:06:19,464
He has a paulownia tree in his fridge.

1707
01:06:19,634 --> 01:06:21,764
- You have it in your fridge? - Do you?

1708
01:06:21,764 --> 01:06:23,134
Yesterday...

1709
01:06:23,134 --> 01:06:26,894
- Who has a tree in their fridge? - I have a pine tree at home.

1710
01:06:27,064 --> 01:06:28,594
And... Hold on.

1711
01:06:28,594 --> 01:06:31,094
- Answer after he finishes asking. - Give me another chance.

1712
01:06:31,094 --> 01:06:33,364
Fine. I got nervous.

1713
01:06:33,734 --> 01:06:35,064
I got nervous.

1714
01:06:35,194 --> 01:06:36,234
Give me another chance.

1715
01:06:36,234 --> 01:06:37,594
- We'll give you one more chance. - Don't be nervous.

1716
01:06:37,594 --> 01:06:39,634
- I was too nervous. - Ready.

1717
01:06:39,634 --> 01:06:40,964
(He's determined.)

1718
01:06:40,964 --> 01:06:42,994
Set, go.

1719
01:06:42,994 --> 01:06:44,194
What do you call your wife?

1720
01:06:44,364 --> 01:06:45,734
Oh Jung Tae.

1721
01:06:46,194 --> 01:06:48,934
Oh Jung Tae. It's the comedian.

1722
01:06:48,934 --> 01:06:52,434
(Wait. Are you talking about him?)

1723
01:06:52,664 --> 01:06:55,134
- This question... - Look up "Oh Jung Tae".

1724
01:06:55,134 --> 01:06:56,494
Oh Jung Tae.

1725
01:06:56,794 --> 01:06:58,134
Are you okay, Mrs. Yu?

1726
01:06:58,294 --> 01:07:00,204
- I... - Are you okay, Mrs. Yu?

1727
01:07:00,734 --> 01:07:01,764
Why did you say Oh Jung Tae?

1728
01:07:01,764 --> 01:07:04,794
I was going to do nouns. I had paulownia tree and Oh Jung Tae.

1729
01:07:05,594 --> 01:07:07,534
- Paulownia tree. - Paulownia tree and Oh Jung Tae.

1730
01:07:07,534 --> 01:07:09,364
I don't know how to respond.

1731
01:07:09,464 --> 01:07:11,764
I didn't know he'll ask me that.

1732
01:07:11,834 --> 01:07:13,164
- Don't worry. - This is too funny.

1733
01:07:13,634 --> 01:07:15,794
You call your wife Oh Jung Tae?

1734
01:07:15,894 --> 01:07:16,964
It's her nickname.

1735
01:07:17,164 --> 01:07:19,494
Six people failed so far.

1736
01:07:20,164 --> 01:07:22,094
- Okay. - You can do it.

1737
01:07:22,764 --> 01:07:24,564
Set, go.

1738
01:07:24,564 --> 01:07:25,894
What do you often say to your girlfriend?

1739
01:07:25,994 --> 01:07:27,064
Sister-in-law.

1740
01:07:29,934 --> 01:07:33,094
(Your girlfriend is your sister-in-law?)

1741
01:07:33,094 --> 01:07:34,264
Hold on.

1742
01:07:34,264 --> 01:07:36,034
His girlfriend is also his sister-in-law?

1743
01:07:36,494 --> 01:07:38,164
His girlfriend is also his sister-in-law.

1744
01:07:38,294 --> 01:07:39,534
Who's this sister-in-law?

1745
01:07:39,864 --> 01:07:41,264
- Hey. - It's not true.

1746
01:07:41,264 --> 01:07:42,664
- Who is it? - It's not true.

1747
01:07:43,234 --> 01:07:45,064
- You ungrateful... - Is it my wife?

1748
01:07:47,134 --> 01:07:49,894
Our wives were saying how weird you are.

1749
01:07:50,464 --> 01:07:52,864
- They love me so much. - Say who it is.

1750
01:07:52,864 --> 01:07:54,034
What are you talking about?

1751
01:07:54,034 --> 01:07:55,664
- It's true. - I can believe him.

1752
01:07:55,664 --> 01:07:57,564
You're making me look like trash.

1753
01:07:58,034 --> 01:07:59,834
That was your fault.

1754
01:08:00,064 --> 01:08:01,764
This is hard. This is so difficult.

1755
01:08:02,564 --> 01:08:04,164
- Ready. - Look at her eyes.

1756
01:08:04,164 --> 01:08:06,094
(Staring)

1757
01:08:06,094 --> 01:08:07,164
Go ahead.

1758
01:08:07,664 --> 01:08:09,534
You're playing this game.

1759
01:08:09,534 --> 01:08:10,564
(It's your turn.)

1760
01:08:10,564 --> 01:08:13,034
- She's not going to focus. - All right. Ready.

1761
01:08:13,634 --> 01:08:15,764
Set, go.

1762
01:08:15,764 --> 01:08:17,664
- How do you relieve stress? - Waterproof device.

1763
01:08:17,894 --> 01:08:19,064
What is your nickname?

1764
01:08:19,134 --> 01:08:21,334
Strict actions will be taken against smoking inside the studio.

1765
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:24,094
- What is your biggest lie? - Fire hydrant.

1766
01:08:24,204 --> 01:08:25,464
That works.

1767
01:08:26,294 --> 01:08:28,094
(That was perfect.)

1768
01:08:28,094 --> 01:08:29,094
That worked.

1769
01:08:29,094 --> 01:08:30,494
- Wait. Fire hydrants? - That worked.

1770
01:08:30,494 --> 01:08:33,204
What is your biggest lie? Fire hydrant.

1771
01:08:33,264 --> 01:08:34,434
What's wrong? That works.

1772
01:08:34,434 --> 01:08:35,864
- Don't be so stubborn. - No way.

1773
01:08:35,864 --> 01:08:37,164
It doesn't make any sense.

1774
01:08:37,164 --> 01:08:38,564
- He keeps insisting. - Look.

1775
01:08:38,564 --> 01:08:40,894
Jae Seok's wife's nickname is Oh Jung Tae.

1776
01:08:40,894 --> 01:08:41,894
(That makes sense.)

1777
01:08:41,894 --> 01:08:42,894
- Hey. - Right?

1778
01:08:42,894 --> 01:08:45,064
It doesn't make sense that her lie is a fire hydrant.

1779
01:08:45,064 --> 01:08:47,204
- What was that for? - This one's right.

1780
01:08:47,204 --> 01:08:48,494
- What? - She got it.

1781
01:08:48,494 --> 01:08:49,994
So Min passes.

1782
01:08:51,204 --> 01:08:52,734
She's so good.

1783
01:08:52,894 --> 01:08:55,064
Her team came in first,

1784
01:08:55,434 --> 01:08:57,634
so we have to decide who goes first.

1785
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:58,894
- Let's do rock, paper, scissors. - All right.

1786
01:08:59,064 --> 01:09:01,564
That's too ordinary.

1787
01:09:01,794 --> 01:09:04,994
Do you want to play this game against each other? One person each?

1788
01:09:04,994 --> 01:09:07,394
Okay. Hyo Lyn and Ji Hyo can play each other.

1789
01:09:07,394 --> 01:09:08,704
- Do I ask? - Yes.

1790
01:09:08,704 --> 01:09:10,334
You ask then she'll do it too.

1791
01:09:11,234 --> 01:09:12,594
Let's go. Hyo Lyn goes first.

1792
01:09:12,894 --> 01:09:14,094
Set, go.

1793
01:09:14,094 --> 01:09:15,204
What do you want to eat now?

1794
01:09:15,204 --> 01:09:16,294
I'll build you a house.

1795
01:09:16,294 --> 01:09:17,864
How do you feel now that Gary is married?

1796
01:09:17,994 --> 01:09:18,994
You.

1797
01:09:20,064 --> 01:09:21,704
How do you feel now that Gary is married?

1798
01:09:21,704 --> 01:09:24,394
(She says it again.)

1799
01:09:24,394 --> 01:09:26,594
- She doesn't know what to say. - Ji Hyo.

1800
01:09:26,834 --> 01:09:27,934
Ji Hyo.

1801
01:09:27,934 --> 01:09:29,534
She said that earlier too.

1802
01:09:29,534 --> 01:09:30,704
(She might be cursing.)

1803
01:09:30,704 --> 01:09:32,294
How dare you change your number?

1804
01:09:32,794 --> 01:09:34,564
(Ji Hyo is flustered by Gary.)

1805
01:09:34,564 --> 01:09:37,064
- "You." - "You." That's all she said.

1806
01:09:37,204 --> 01:09:38,864
I heard the question.

1807
01:09:38,864 --> 01:09:40,434
Why couldn't you answer it?

1808
01:09:41,964 --> 01:09:43,564
- Ji Hyo. - My gosh.

1809
01:09:43,564 --> 01:09:44,734
You, Ji Hyo.

1810
01:09:44,734 --> 01:09:45,894
(Ji Hyo fails.)

1811
01:09:45,894 --> 01:09:48,264
Doesn't this remind you of the Of Course Game?

1812
01:09:49,064 --> 01:09:50,734
Why couldn't you answer, by the way?

1813
01:09:51,594 --> 01:09:53,734
- Ji Hyo, send him a video message. - You.

1814
01:09:53,734 --> 01:09:56,564
(Is she going to send a video message to Gary?)

1815
01:09:56,704 --> 01:09:57,764
Hey.

1816
01:09:57,764 --> 01:09:59,234
(To Gary.)

1817
01:09:59,464 --> 01:10:03,934
(It's been a while since she called him.)

1818
01:10:03,934 --> 01:10:05,034
Be happy.

1819
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:09,864
(Be happy.)

1820
01:10:09,994 --> 01:10:13,734
(Congratulations on getting married, our dearest Gary.)

1821
01:10:13,994 --> 01:10:16,064
The orders have been decided.

1822
01:10:16,094 --> 01:10:18,634
You can start Running Marble now.

1823
01:10:18,764 --> 01:10:20,894
- What is she doing? - So Min.

1824
01:10:21,164 --> 01:10:23,034
Predict what number you're going to land on.

1825
01:10:23,034 --> 01:10:24,794
- I pick 5. - 5?

1826
01:10:24,794 --> 01:10:26,964
(Move the number of spaces on the die and buy the place you land on.)

1827
01:10:29,394 --> 01:10:30,734
(What country will Team So Min land on?)

1828
01:10:30,734 --> 01:10:32,334
You got four.

1829
01:10:33,164 --> 01:10:34,964
- One, two, three... - It's Thailand.

1830
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:37,204
- Buy it. - 20 dollars? We'll get it.

1831
01:10:38,494 --> 01:10:39,704
It's Hyo Lyn's turn.

1832
01:10:39,704 --> 01:10:40,894
I'm really bad at this.

1833
01:10:40,894 --> 01:10:41,964
- You'll be fine. - Throw it.

1834
01:10:41,964 --> 01:10:43,264
Gold key sounds good.

1835
01:10:43,534 --> 01:10:45,864
- Four. - Yes. Okay.

1836
01:10:46,494 --> 01:10:47,664
You can move.

1837
01:10:47,704 --> 01:10:48,794
It's your turn, Ji Hyo.

1838
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:51,864
(What will this lucky woman land on?)

1839
01:10:51,864 --> 01:10:53,434
- Two. - Japan.

1840
01:10:53,664 --> 01:10:55,894
- Let's buy it. - Buy it.

1841
01:10:55,894 --> 01:10:58,034
- You have thrown the die once each. - Yes.

1842
01:10:58,564 --> 01:10:59,794
There must be something to this.

1843
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:02,364
- They're moving fast. - Are we leaving?

1844
01:11:02,734 --> 01:11:04,234
- Are we leaving? - No way.

1845
01:11:04,234 --> 01:11:06,494
Am I going to Japan again? I was there last week.

1846
01:11:06,534 --> 01:11:08,934
You were told to bring your passports.

1847
01:11:09,864 --> 01:11:11,534
(Are we going on a one-day trip again?)

1848
01:11:11,534 --> 01:11:12,994
I'm going to Thailand?

1849
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:16,034
- It takes 5.5 hours. - It takes 6.5 hours.

1850
01:11:16,294 --> 01:11:19,064
These lands are not yours yet.

1851
01:11:21,494 --> 01:11:24,834
In order to buy these countries, you must spin a roulette...

1852
01:11:24,834 --> 01:11:27,034
and win the mission first.

1853
01:11:27,364 --> 01:11:29,894
So Hyo Lyn's team might buy it if we can't.

1854
01:11:30,034 --> 01:11:32,834
If each team buys two countries with the same color,

1855
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:35,664
or if a team goes bankrupt, this game is over.

1856
01:11:35,834 --> 01:11:37,134
Two countries of the same color.

1857
01:11:37,534 --> 01:11:39,294
Once a team earns two countries with the same color,

1858
01:11:39,294 --> 01:11:42,204
the remaining team with the least number of countries loses.

1859
01:11:42,664 --> 01:11:44,864
If a team goes bankrupt, they lose.

1860
01:11:44,864 --> 01:11:47,434
One of these teams will get a Tour Sticker.

1861
01:11:48,564 --> 01:11:51,264
(Haha and Se Chan are in danger of going on a dangerous tour.)

1862
01:11:51,264 --> 01:11:57,234
(Will they leave? Or will we get new candidates today?)

1863
01:11:57,634 --> 01:11:58,764
Go, Haha.

1864
01:11:59,134 --> 01:12:00,664
- Spin the roulette. - You can do it.

1865
01:12:00,864 --> 01:12:03,134
- Me? - Which one do you want?

1866
01:12:03,134 --> 01:12:05,534
Let's go for "Cultural Experience" and get a massage.

1867
01:12:06,964 --> 01:12:08,734
(If they get a difficult mission, it'll be hard to buy a country.)

1868
01:12:08,734 --> 01:12:10,264
- Don't touch it. - I think it's moving.

1869
01:12:10,264 --> 01:12:11,894
- It was like this. - It's "Cultural Experience".

1870
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:13,704
Hyo Lyn's next.

1871
01:12:15,134 --> 01:12:16,234
Food is the best.

1872
01:12:16,234 --> 01:12:18,864
It's food. I think we'll get it.

1873
01:12:18,864 --> 01:12:20,064
(Will they be able to eat?)

1874
01:12:20,764 --> 01:12:23,534
(They get to eat Thai food.)

1875
01:12:23,534 --> 01:12:24,894
- I was shocked. - It's okay.

1876
01:12:24,894 --> 01:12:27,734
Let's go, Ji Hyo. Food.

1877
01:12:27,734 --> 01:12:28,834
(What is Team Ji Hyo's mission regarding Japan?)

1878
01:12:30,894 --> 01:12:32,734
- "Buy an item." - Made in Japan.

1879
01:12:32,734 --> 01:12:34,064
There are so many things made in Japan.

1880
01:12:34,564 --> 01:12:38,064
You can get going and complete your missions.

1881
01:12:38,064 --> 01:12:40,464
(They have to complete each of their missions.)

1882
01:12:41,794 --> 01:12:43,034
(10 minutes before the start of mission)

1883
01:12:43,034 --> 01:12:44,964
You'll get going now.

1884
01:12:44,964 --> 01:12:47,634
Before you go, we'll play a game called...

1885
01:12:47,634 --> 01:12:49,704
Obtain Extra Money.

1886
01:12:49,704 --> 01:12:51,964
(Obtain Extra Money)

1887
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:54,994
It's called Obtain Extra Money.

1888
01:12:54,994 --> 01:12:56,094
Are we going to play a game?

1889
01:12:56,094 --> 01:12:58,894
Each member gets five dollars.

1890
01:12:59,134 --> 01:13:04,594
You will get this amount only if all of you write this down.

1891
01:13:04,894 --> 01:13:06,764
- That's easy. - If you write...

1892
01:13:06,864 --> 01:13:11,034
the lowest amount among the three of you,

1893
01:13:11,334 --> 01:13:15,834
that person will receive 10 times the written amount.

1894
01:13:15,834 --> 01:13:16,934
What?

1895
01:13:17,034 --> 01:13:20,534
That member will get 10 times the written amount.

1896
01:13:20,534 --> 01:13:21,994
The other two...

1897
01:13:21,994 --> 01:13:24,494
will get the minimum amount of money.

1898
01:13:24,494 --> 01:13:26,534
Remaining two will get the minimum amount of money.

1899
01:13:26,704 --> 01:13:28,234
Let's not do this.

1900
01:13:28,234 --> 01:13:29,794
(Gain 5 dollars for loyalty or 10 times the money for betrayal.)

1901
01:13:29,794 --> 01:13:33,734
(How will the 9 members decide?)

1902
01:13:34,264 --> 01:13:37,064
To make it anonymous,

1903
01:13:37,064 --> 01:13:38,434
we will give you cell phones.

1904
01:13:38,434 --> 01:13:41,094
Send your name and the amount to the staff's number.

1905
01:13:41,094 --> 01:13:43,034
- Let's think about this. - Let's write the same amount.

1906
01:13:43,034 --> 01:13:44,334
We should be loyal to each other.

1907
01:13:44,334 --> 01:13:45,334
(They need to message their amount.)

1908
01:13:45,964 --> 01:13:47,594
- Write 5 dollars. - 5 dollars.

1909
01:13:47,594 --> 01:13:50,034
- Jae Seok. Se Chan. - Yes?

1910
01:13:50,594 --> 01:13:51,964
Look me in the eye.

1911
01:13:52,764 --> 01:13:54,934
I am not going to worry about the consequences.

1912
01:13:55,134 --> 01:13:56,834
- That's my decision. - Will you write the minimum amount?

1913
01:13:57,734 --> 01:13:59,794
There is no need to discuss the matter.

1914
01:13:59,794 --> 01:14:02,704
We already have the answer. All of us should write five dollars.

1915
01:14:02,834 --> 01:14:04,934
Let's take a selfie as a team.

1916
01:14:04,934 --> 01:14:06,934
The screen is very wide.

1917
01:14:06,934 --> 01:14:09,564
- It has high resolution. - That's right.

1918
01:14:09,934 --> 01:14:11,294
One, two, three.

1919
01:14:11,294 --> 01:14:12,664
(Let's play as a team.)

1920
01:14:12,664 --> 01:14:13,894
Okay.

1921
01:14:13,894 --> 01:14:15,934
- How nice! - It's a nice picture.

1922
01:14:16,634 --> 01:14:18,234
Wait a minute.

1923
01:14:18,234 --> 01:14:19,564
What should I write?

1924
01:14:19,704 --> 01:14:21,964
- Okay. - We are a team.

1925
01:14:21,964 --> 01:14:23,934
Don't write 50 cents.

1926
01:14:24,294 --> 01:14:25,834
Let's write the same amount.

1927
01:14:25,834 --> 01:14:27,164
- Let's write the same amount. - That's right.

1928
01:14:27,164 --> 01:14:29,334
Other teams will fail to unite.

1929
01:14:29,334 --> 01:14:31,564
Other teams will fail to unite.

1930
01:14:31,564 --> 01:14:32,894
- At first... - Haha.

1931
01:14:32,894 --> 01:14:35,334
- Pretend to listen to me at least. - All right.

1932
01:14:35,334 --> 01:14:36,704
- Pretend to listen to me at least. - All right.

1933
01:14:36,704 --> 01:14:39,094
- All right. - I can see...

1934
01:14:39,094 --> 01:14:40,564
- his head spinning. - I want to do that,

1935
01:14:40,564 --> 01:14:42,294
but I don't trust you two.

1936
01:14:42,294 --> 01:14:43,434
I will really write five dollars.

1937
01:14:43,494 --> 01:14:44,794
- Se Chan. - Yes?

1938
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:46,564
Don't be that way.

1939
01:14:47,334 --> 01:14:48,394
What do you mean?

1940
01:14:48,394 --> 01:14:49,664
Write five dollars.

1941
01:14:50,294 --> 01:14:51,734
I erased what I had written down.

1942
01:14:51,964 --> 01:14:54,094
(The members begin to analyse each other.)

1943
01:14:54,794 --> 01:14:56,264
Why are you licking your lips?

1944
01:14:56,464 --> 01:14:57,934
- Don't be suspicious. - Why did you do that?

1945
01:14:57,934 --> 01:15:00,264
It wasn't anything like that. There is nothing to think about.

1946
01:15:00,264 --> 01:15:01,464
So why did you lick your lips?

1947
01:15:02,294 --> 01:15:03,964
Let's write five dollars.

1948
01:15:03,964 --> 01:15:05,704
- Se Chan, what was that? - Why did you lick your lips?

1949
01:15:05,704 --> 01:15:08,434
I did not. This cell phone has nice functions.

1950
01:15:08,434 --> 01:15:10,394
(The air of distrust is heavy.)

1951
01:15:11,704 --> 01:15:13,864
(They use the state of the art security system.)

1952
01:15:13,864 --> 01:15:16,394
It opened right away when I put my face in front of it.

1953
01:15:17,294 --> 01:15:18,834
- I will write the text. - Where do we write it?

1954
01:15:18,834 --> 01:15:20,064
(They send texts secretly.)

1955
01:15:20,064 --> 01:15:21,734
- Jong Kook... - Did he send one?

1956
01:15:21,734 --> 01:15:23,464
- submitted his answer. - I didn't write mine yet.

1957
01:15:23,594 --> 01:15:25,704
- Okay. - We are a team.

1958
01:15:25,834 --> 01:15:28,064
Okay, that's a good amount. I sent a text.

1959
01:15:28,234 --> 01:15:29,864
What should I do?

1960
01:15:29,864 --> 01:15:32,164
(Did they choose betrayal or loyalty?)

1961
01:15:32,264 --> 01:15:34,764
Look at this. It works right away.

1962
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:36,464
- I unlocked it. - I can do that too.

1963
01:15:36,934 --> 01:15:39,464
It won't work if you use my phone.

1964
01:15:39,464 --> 01:15:40,934
(They check out the security system of the phone.)

1965
01:15:41,234 --> 01:15:42,664
- It doesn't work, right? - It's fascinating.

1966
01:15:42,664 --> 01:15:44,464
- Does it scan my iris? - Yes, it does.

1967
01:15:44,564 --> 01:15:46,094
- How many times was it? - 10 times.

1968
01:15:46,094 --> 01:15:48,394
Why do you need to ask that?

1969
01:15:48,864 --> 01:15:50,704
You are making me nervous, Haha.

1970
01:15:51,894 --> 01:15:53,164
I sent mine.

1971
01:15:53,334 --> 01:15:55,434
- I sent mine. - I think you sent it to me.

1972
01:15:55,434 --> 01:15:57,234
- You sent it to me. - I sent it wrong.

1973
01:15:57,704 --> 01:15:59,464
- Let me check your answer first. - Go ahead.

1974
01:15:59,464 --> 01:16:01,164
- Let me see what you wrote. - I typed in the wrong number.

1975
01:16:01,164 --> 01:16:02,764
- I stayed loyal. - Let me check.

1976
01:16:02,834 --> 01:16:04,334
"Lee Kwang Soo, five dollars".

1977
01:16:04,334 --> 01:16:05,494
That's my answer.

1978
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:07,664
- "Lee Kwang Soo, five dollars". - That's my answer.

1979
01:16:07,664 --> 01:16:10,064
- Did you fake the mistake? - It was an honest mistake.

1980
01:16:10,494 --> 01:16:12,034
- He is cool. - You still doubt me.

1981
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:13,594
No, I believe you.

1982
01:16:13,594 --> 01:16:16,534
(Everyone sent their answers for the secret emergency fund.)

1983
01:16:17,634 --> 01:16:19,164
(The result for Ji Hyo's team is revealed.)

1984
01:16:19,164 --> 01:16:20,594
This team is loyal.

1985
01:16:20,734 --> 01:16:21,894
Ji Hyo wrote...

1986
01:16:22,164 --> 01:16:23,334

1987
01:16:23,334 --> 01:16:24,834
- Of course, I did. - You did.

1988
01:16:25,434 --> 01:16:26,764
Se Chan wrote...

1989
01:16:28,364 --> 01:16:29,394
one dollar.

1990
01:16:29,394 --> 01:16:31,964
(Se Chan wrote 1 dollar.)

1991
01:16:31,964 --> 01:16:33,134
I can't believe you.

1992
01:16:33,134 --> 01:16:35,634
I had no choice. I am in no position to take chances.

1993
01:16:35,634 --> 01:16:36,764
I can't believe you.

1994
01:16:36,764 --> 01:16:38,664
- This is too much. - I had no choice.

1995
01:16:38,664 --> 01:16:40,734
How can you deviate when we promised to write five dollars?

1996
01:16:40,734 --> 01:16:42,464
I have two Tour Stickers.

1997

Jae Seok wrote...

1998

01:16:44,964 --> 01:16:46,094
(Jae Seok wrote 65 cents.)

2000
01:16:46,094 --> 01:16:47,964
For goodness' sake.

2001
01:16:48,294 --> 01:16:50,234
I can't believe you.

2002
01:16:50,494 --> 01:16:51,834
- I was desperate. - I knew...

2003
01:16:51,934 --> 01:16:54,364
he would do that when he licked his lips.

2004
01:16:54,364 --> 01:16:56,164
- I will get 65 cents. - At least...

2005
01:16:56,164 --> 01:16:57,594
I had a semblance of conscience.

2006
01:16:57,794 --> 01:16:59,494
All three members...

2007
01:16:59,834 --> 01:17:01,764
submitted different amounts.

2008
01:17:02,394 --> 01:17:03,794
All of us would've gotten five dollars...

2009
01:17:03,794 --> 01:17:05,634
- had we remained loyal. - I knew this would happen.

2010
01:17:05,934 --> 01:17:07,594
The person who wrote the minimum amount is...

2011
01:17:07,734 --> 01:17:10,264
- Hyo Lyn. - What was the amount you wrote?

2012
01:17:10,264 --> 01:17:11,494
What was the amount you wrote?

2013
01:17:11,494 --> 01:17:12,934
What happened? Did I write the minimum amount?

2014
01:17:13,034 --> 01:17:14,204
Does that mean I get 10 times the amount?

2015
01:17:14,204 --> 01:17:15,934
You will get 10 times the amount.

2016
01:17:16,294 --> 01:17:17,594
(She is joyful.)

2017
01:17:17,594 --> 01:17:19,264
She betrayed us.

2018
01:17:19,264 --> 01:17:20,834
- It's not like that. - Hyo Lyn...

2019
01:17:20,934 --> 01:17:22,064
wrote three dollars.

2020
01:17:22,064 --> 01:17:23,704
- Three dollars? - I can't believe you.

2021
01:17:23,704 --> 01:17:25,534
Hyo Lyn will get 30 dollars,

2022
01:17:26,164 --> 01:17:28,994
and you two will get three dollars each.

Haha wrote...

2024
01:17:30,234 --> 01:17:31,964
- 3 dollars and 90 cents. - For goodness' sake.

2025
01:17:33,064 --> 01:17:34,094
(I knew you would do that.)

2026
01:17:34,094 --> 01:17:35,634
Where did 90 cents come from?

2027
01:17:35,634 --> 01:17:36,794
- That's too much. - Where did 90 cents come from?

2028
01:17:36,794 --> 01:17:38,834
- That's too much. - Let's wait and see.

2029
01:17:39,034 --> 01:17:40,894
You could have written a smaller amount.

2030
01:17:41,364 --> 01:17:43,764
Secondly, So Min wrote...

2031
01:17:44,064 --> 01:17:45,294
50 cents.

2032
01:17:45,294 --> 01:17:46,794
Do you call yourself human?

2033
01:17:46,794 --> 01:17:49,134
- 50 cents. - Do you call yourself human?

2034
01:17:49,134 --> 01:17:50,764
You wanted to get five dollars.

2035
01:17:50,764 --> 01:17:51,964
I don't understand.

2036
01:17:51,964 --> 01:17:53,564
Why did you write 50 cents?

2037
01:17:53,634 --> 01:17:55,794
What's 10 times the amount?

2038
01:17:55,794 --> 01:17:58,064
- You wanted to get 5 dollars. - You will get 5 dollars.

2039
01:17:58,464 --> 01:18:00,164
You could have written down five dollars.

2040
01:18:00,164 --> 01:18:01,664
I don't trust you.

2041
01:18:01,664 --> 01:18:03,664
She doesn't want to give us that money.

2042
01:18:03,664 --> 01:18:05,704
You shouldn't have said anything.

2043
01:18:05,704 --> 01:18:07,334
Why are you laughing?

2044
01:18:07,664 --> 01:18:09,364
This is a ridiculous situation.

2045
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:12,664
The last one is Kwang Soo.

2046
01:18:12,894 --> 01:18:13,964
Kwang Soo wrote...

2047
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:16,564
- 50 cents. - Forget it.

2048
01:18:17,064 --> 01:18:19,494
(Forget it. We are all the same.)

2049
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:21,494
I wrote the same amount.

2050
01:18:21,494 --> 01:18:23,134
The two of them are the same.

2051
01:18:23,134 --> 01:18:24,534
I had my reasons.

2052
01:18:24,534 --> 01:18:27,764
In conclusion, Haha will get 50 cents...

2053
01:18:28,134 --> 01:18:30,634
while So Min and Kwang Soo will get five dollars each.

2054
01:18:30,994 --> 01:18:32,594
(The teams receive their results.)

2055
01:18:32,594 --> 01:18:34,034
It couldn't be helped. Everyone is on his or her own.

2056
01:18:34,294 --> 01:18:38,434
(Ji Hyo's team, Hyo Lyn's team, and So Min's team)

2057
01:18:38,594 --> 01:18:39,834
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2058
01:18:39,834 --> 01:18:41,434
(Running Marble starts.)

2059
01:18:41,734 --> 01:18:43,094
We are leaving.

2060
01:18:43,094 --> 01:18:44,564
It will be tasty.

2061
01:18:44,564 --> 01:18:46,794
- What should we eat? - Where should we go?

2062
01:18:46,794 --> 01:18:48,164
- Let's go to Itaewon. - Itaewon.

2063
01:18:48,164 --> 01:18:50,164
- Itaewon would be the best. - Is there a restaurant you know?

2064
01:18:50,264 --> 01:18:51,664
We can go to Suk Chun's restaurant.

2065
01:18:51,664 --> 01:18:53,634
- Shall we go there? - That would be for the best.

2066
01:18:53,734 --> 01:18:55,634
Which Japanese product shall we buy?

2067
01:18:55,634 --> 01:18:57,764
- Let's look it up. - That's a good idea.

2068
01:18:57,764 --> 01:19:00,704
When you press this, it shows nearby shops.

2069
01:19:00,704 --> 01:19:03,364
There it is. You see the button for shopping, right?

2070
01:19:03,664 --> 01:19:05,334
- There it is. - I see it.

2071
01:19:05,334 --> 01:19:07,394
- You see it, right? - This is incredible.

2072
01:19:07,394 --> 01:19:08,994
How about we go to a stationery store?

2073
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:10,294
- That's a good idea. - A stationery store is good.

2074
01:19:10,294 --> 01:19:12,064
- Let's go. - My goodness.

2075
01:19:12,064 --> 01:19:13,834
(They leave for a stationery store nearby.)

2076
01:19:13,994 --> 01:19:15,664
Let's go to a stationery store...

2077
01:19:15,664 --> 01:19:17,964
and get a Japanese product first.

2078
01:19:17,964 --> 01:19:19,634
Let's do that.

2079
01:19:19,634 --> 01:19:20,634
(While Hyo Lyn's team and Ji Hyo's team are advancing...)

2080
01:19:20,634 --> 01:19:22,264
- Let's divide it evenly. - Play rock, paper, scissors.

2081
01:19:22,264 --> 01:19:23,494
- Okay. - Let's divide it evenly.

2082
01:19:23,494 --> 01:19:25,294
- Let's divide it evenly. - Let's do that for now.

2083
01:19:25,294 --> 01:19:27,364
- If we lose, - Let's take a look.

2084
01:19:27,364 --> 01:19:30,734
give me 5 dollars and give him 10 dollars, okay?

2085
01:19:31,094 --> 01:19:32,204
(1st place gets 70 dollars. 2nd and 3rd places get 40 dollars.)

2086
01:19:32,204 --> 01:19:33,564
I can't believe you.

2087
01:19:33,564 --> 01:19:35,734
Okay. I can't believe you wrote down 50 cents.

2088
01:19:35,964 --> 01:19:38,764
They can't pull off a big scam.

2089
01:19:38,864 --> 01:19:40,534
Right?

2090
01:19:40,534 --> 01:19:42,294
We won five dollars.

2091
01:19:42,434 --> 01:19:44,994
Let's play rock, paper, scissors. The winner gets more slots.

2092
01:19:44,994 --> 01:19:46,934
Okay. Winner gets eight slots.

2093
01:19:46,934 --> 01:19:48,034
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

2094
01:19:48,134 --> 01:19:50,334
(So Min comes last.)

2095
01:19:51,534 --> 01:19:53,094
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Okay.

2096
01:19:53,094 --> 01:19:55,064
(Kwang Soo comes first place.)

2097
01:19:55,334 --> 01:19:56,494
My goodness.

2098
01:19:56,494 --> 01:19:59,064
(I don't know why this is so annoying.)

2099
01:19:59,064 --> 01:20:01,334
- This is so annoying. - He is annoying.

2100
01:20:01,594 --> 01:20:03,534
I don't want Kwang Soo to win.

2101
01:20:03,564 --> 01:20:05,464
- Please. - Let's do this.

2102
01:20:05,464 --> 01:20:08,264
Can you give me one slot?

2103
01:20:08,594 --> 01:20:09,994
(Please give me a slot.)

2104
01:20:09,994 --> 01:20:11,864
- What? - Can you give me a slot?

2105
01:20:12,264 --> 01:20:13,894
I will be good to you.

2106
01:20:14,234 --> 01:20:16,234
Please give me a slot.

2107
01:20:16,234 --> 01:20:17,704
I will be good to you.

2108
01:20:17,704 --> 01:20:19,094
Sorry, I wrote everything down.

2109
01:20:19,434 --> 01:20:21,834
(He doesn't give So Min a chance.)

2110
01:20:22,264 --> 01:20:23,464
I have five slots.

2111
01:20:24,334 --> 01:20:26,164
I need to do well.

2112
01:20:26,264 --> 01:20:27,664
All right.

2113
01:20:28,464 --> 01:20:30,234
(So Min only has 3 slots.)

2114
01:20:30,234 --> 01:20:32,234
The winner will get 70 dollars.

2115
01:20:32,234 --> 01:20:33,294
(The winner will get 70 dollars.)

2116
01:20:33,294 --> 01:20:35,834
This is for first place.

2117
01:20:36,564 --> 01:20:38,864
(Who will the roulette decide?)

2118
01:20:40,664 --> 01:20:41,794
The probability...

2119
01:20:42,994 --> 01:20:45,064
(Kwang Soo wins.)

2120
01:20:45,064 --> 01:20:46,794
(It's an unexpected win for an unlucky man.)

2121
01:20:46,794 --> 01:20:48,494
I will win today.

2122
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:50,064
I am first place in my team.

2123
01:20:50,064 --> 01:20:51,894
Then I will get five dollars more.

2124
01:20:51,994 --> 01:20:53,564
- It's in the packet. - Really?

2125
01:20:53,564 --> 01:20:55,394
Is my 50 cents in the packet?

2126
01:20:56,164 --> 01:21:00,064
(Haha was the victim of the 50-cent duo.)

2127
01:21:01,134 --> 01:21:03,494
You are quite thorough.

2128
01:21:03,494 --> 01:21:06,564
(It's the betrayers versus the trickster.)

2129
01:21:06,564 --> 01:21:10,034
(What will become of this team?)

2130
01:21:10,294 --> 01:21:12,164
I haven't been to Itaewon often.

2131
01:21:12,364 --> 01:21:14,534
Hyo Lyn, your feet are very small.

2132
01:21:14,534 --> 01:21:15,704
I know.

2133
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:17,034
- What's your shoe size? - Well...

2134
01:21:17,034 --> 01:21:18,064
Is it 225mm?

2135
01:21:18,064 --> 01:21:19,764
- I wear 225mm or 230mm. - I knew it.

2136
01:21:19,764 --> 01:21:21,434
Your feet are very small.

2137
01:21:21,434 --> 01:21:22,864
Your feet are very small for your height.

2138
01:21:22,864 --> 01:21:25,634
It's the right size for my height.

2139
01:21:25,934 --> 01:21:27,204
I am pretty short.

2140
01:21:27,204 --> 01:21:29,134
- Your height? - You look tall.

2141
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:31,634
Men don't like tall women.

2142
01:21:31,894 --> 01:21:33,734
- Don't be ridiculous. - Men don't like tall women.

2143
01:21:33,734 --> 01:21:35,794
- You are wrong. - It's true. They really don't.

2144
01:21:35,794 --> 01:21:37,634
Jong Kook is the same.

2145
01:21:37,634 --> 01:21:39,464
He is right. I don't like tall women.

2146
01:21:39,464 --> 01:21:42,464
Women who are tall don't seem like women to me.

2147
01:21:43,204 --> 01:21:44,664
(He likes petite women...)

2148
01:21:44,664 --> 01:21:46,794
(like me.)

2149
01:21:47,394 --> 01:21:48,794
What is your ideal type?

2150
01:21:48,994 --> 01:21:50,334
- Me? - Yes.

2151
01:21:51,334 --> 01:21:53,234
(Listening)

2152
01:21:53,234 --> 01:21:55,134
I like men...

2153
01:21:55,134 --> 01:21:57,094
who are dependable.

2154
01:21:57,434 --> 01:21:58,464
That's the type of men I like.

2155
01:21:58,964 --> 01:22:01,164
(He makes the most dependable facial expression.)

2156
01:22:01,464 --> 01:22:02,994
There are people who get along.

2157
01:22:02,994 --> 01:22:04,064
That's right.

2158
01:22:04,064 --> 01:22:06,034
Do you go to a tanning salon every day?

2159
01:22:06,034 --> 01:22:08,364
- No. - Do you go once a week?

2160
01:22:08,364 --> 01:22:10,164
I go to a warm country.

2161
01:22:11,264 --> 01:22:13,334
I love warm countries. This is what I do when I go there.

2162
01:22:13,334 --> 01:22:14,704
As soon as I wake up,

2163
01:22:14,704 --> 01:22:16,494
I soak up the sun...

2164
01:22:16,494 --> 01:22:17,934
and lounge at the swimming pool.

2165
01:22:18,594 --> 01:22:20,994
- I do that no matter what. - I am the same.

2166
01:22:21,204 --> 01:22:22,964
- I don't come out of the water. - That's right.

2167
01:22:22,964 --> 01:22:24,234
I am like a seal.

2168
01:22:24,394 --> 01:22:26,934
When I get tired, I take a nap under the sun.

2169
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:28,394
You like water.

2170
01:22:28,534 --> 01:22:29,964
I like water.

2171
01:22:29,964 --> 01:22:31,234
I like water, too.

2172
01:22:31,234 --> 01:22:32,364
(Whatever Hyo Lyn likes,)

2173
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:34,364
(Jong Kook likes.)

2174
01:22:34,364 --> 01:22:37,994
(There is a scent of spring between them.)

2175
01:22:39,634 --> 01:22:40,934
Listen.

2176
01:22:40,934 --> 01:22:43,064
Let's move as one...

2177
01:22:43,064 --> 01:22:44,964
- for this mission. - That's right.

2178
01:22:44,964 --> 01:22:46,134
There is no reason to distrust each other now.

2179
01:22:46,134 --> 01:22:47,204
This is clean.

2180
01:22:47,204 --> 01:22:49,164
I figured out how your minds work.

2181
01:22:49,834 --> 01:22:52,994
I was very surprised by 50 cents.

2182
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:55,394
However, I feel better...

2183
01:22:55,864 --> 01:22:57,634
because you aren't fit for a big scam.

2184
01:22:57,704 --> 01:22:59,534
It consoles me.

2185
01:22:59,534 --> 01:23:00,834
- I am serious. - Don't look down on us.

2186
01:23:00,834 --> 01:23:02,064
It's cute.

2187
01:23:02,064 --> 01:23:03,734
I didn't think anyone would write 50 cents.

2188
01:23:04,204 --> 01:23:05,534
Me neither.

2189
01:23:05,534 --> 01:23:09,164
I just wanted to receive my share.

2190
01:23:09,164 --> 01:23:11,204
Me too. I wanted to receive five dollars.

2191
01:23:11,204 --> 01:23:12,864
I understand you perfectly.

2192
01:23:14,204 --> 01:23:16,704
- I know that you're a good person. - Right?

2193
01:23:16,704 --> 01:23:18,094
You are innocent.

2194
01:23:18,094 --> 01:23:19,794
- I had no bad intentions at all. - I could feel that...

2195
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:21,794
- What a load of nonsense. - you didn't want to harm anyone...

2196
01:23:21,794 --> 01:23:24,164
- Whatever. - after hearing what you wrote.

2197
01:23:24,164 --> 01:23:26,534
You guys seem to get along very well.

2198
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:29,364
Keep living like this and you'll become very successful.

2199
01:23:29,364 --> 01:23:31,164
- We'll be really successful. - Right.

2200
01:23:31,164 --> 01:23:32,864
- I can't disagree with that. - Me neither.

2201
01:23:32,864 --> 01:23:35,264
Your apartment will be at least 126m².

2202
01:23:35,264 --> 01:23:37,204
- I agree. - Me too.

2203
01:23:37,334 --> 01:23:39,364
We'll be able to save up a lot of money.

2204
01:23:39,594 --> 01:23:42,864
But I also feel like we could end up in prison.

2205
01:23:42,864 --> 01:23:46,594
- It's okay. You guys play safe. - Do you think so?

2206
01:23:46,964 --> 01:23:49,894
You can go to prison on behalf of me.

2207
01:23:49,894 --> 01:23:52,264
I'll make sure our money's safe and sound.

2208
01:23:52,264 --> 01:23:55,734
(So Min plans their future quite meticulously.)

2209
01:23:57,234 --> 01:23:58,664
What? I know what kind of a person you are.

2210
01:23:59,704 --> 01:24:02,034
You'll be gone by the time I get out.

2211
01:24:03,064 --> 01:24:05,094
Right? I know you very well.

2212
01:24:05,704 --> 01:24:07,704
You need to trust me.

2213
01:24:07,764 --> 01:24:09,334
She is unbelievable.

2214
01:24:09,334 --> 01:24:11,794
She wants you to go to prison on behalf of her.

2215
01:24:11,794 --> 01:24:13,564
(This is only the beginning of their betrayal.)

2216
01:24:13,994 --> 01:24:15,134
This is a fight between ourselves.

2217
01:24:15,134 --> 01:24:18,064
(Who are they betraying each other for?)

2218
01:24:18,064 --> 01:24:19,864
(It will be the biggest...)

2219
01:24:19,864 --> 01:24:22,264
(war of betrayal in the history of Running Man.)

2220
01:24:22,264 --> 01:24:23,764
(They also start carrying out their missions.)

2221
01:24:24,594 --> 01:24:27,434
(Running Man has become more global.)

2222
01:24:27,434 --> 01:24:31,894
(Running Marble has become more diverse.)

2223
01:24:31,894 --> 01:24:33,864
(A global world will unfold...)

2224
01:24:33,864 --> 01:24:38,864
(at the places we know best.)

2225
01:24:38,864 --> 01:24:45,064
(They'll find a connection to many places of the world in the city.)

2226
01:24:45,064 --> 01:24:49,494
(The only thing they can trust is the die.)

2227
01:24:49,494 --> 01:24:52,994
(It's an unexpected global mission in the city.)

2228
01:24:52,994 --> 01:24:57,494
(Who will be the chosen one to go to the Dangerous Tourist Attraction?)
