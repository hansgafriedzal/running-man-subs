00:00:04,832 --> 00:00:07,702
(2017 Running Man's Global Project)

2
00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:10,502
(The most dangerous tourist attractions in the world)

3
00:00:10,502 --> 00:00:14,602
(Last week, the 6 members of Dangerous Trip were decided.)

4
00:00:16,102 --> 00:00:19,302
(Jae Seok picked the dangerous tourist attraction.)

5
00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:22,202
(Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear in Japan)

6
00:00:22,202 --> 00:00:25,302
(It's a place no one wanted to go.)

7
00:00:25,302 --> 00:00:27,202
(We are spared.)

8
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,332
(It takes about two weeks to get a visa for the shoot.)

9
00:00:29,502 --> 00:00:32,202
(The production team hosted a party during the wait.)

10
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:35,602
(Can we eat the food?)

11
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:39,302
(The clueless members were forced to go to Russia and Mongolia.)

12
00:00:40,262 --> 00:00:44,032
(The mission for Team Mongolia: Meet the nomads and milk sheep.)

13
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:47,562
(The mission for Team Russia: Catch king crab and 10 seafood.)

14
00:00:47,562 --> 00:00:49,602
(It's not a simple trip.)

15
00:00:49,602 --> 00:00:52,562
(Their success will exempt 2 people from Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

16
00:00:52,562 --> 00:00:55,632
(The team leaders hold the key to exemption.)

17
00:00:55,632 --> 00:00:58,402
(Thus started Dangerous Trip: Last Chance in Mongolia and Russia.)

18
00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:02,002
(Ji Hyo, I can carry your backpack.)

19
00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:04,462
(The two team leaders overuse their power.)

20
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:06,832
(The rest of the members fight to move up the ranks.)

21
00:01:06,832 --> 00:01:07,832
(Aren't you uncomfortable?)

22
00:01:08,032 --> 00:01:09,232
My goodness.

23
00:01:09,232 --> 00:01:10,832
(Look at me, Jong Kook.)

24
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:14,532
(The members' fierce loyalty helps everything go well for Team Russia.)

25
00:01:15,572 --> 00:01:17,532
(They struggle every step of the way.)

26
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:22,032
(The 2 middle-aged men and 2 women quarrel.)

27
00:01:22,032 --> 00:01:26,202
(Who will complete the mission and win exemption?)

28
00:01:27,932 --> 00:01:29,462
Where do we go?

29
00:01:29,932 --> 00:01:31,832
Let's order a lot of dishes.

30
00:01:31,832 --> 00:01:33,732
- We shouldn't do that. - Let's find a restaurant first.

31
00:01:33,732 --> 00:01:36,302
We should save up money. We haven't found a place to stay.

32
00:01:36,302 --> 00:01:38,962
This feels like Gwanghwamun.

33
00:01:38,962 --> 00:01:40,832
Is there a place that resembles Hongdae?

34
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:43,032
- Seok Jin. - Hongdae.

35
00:01:43,032 --> 00:01:45,002
- I am thirsty. - It's a hotel.

36
00:01:45,102 --> 00:01:46,132
Isn't this a hotel?

37
00:01:46,132 --> 00:01:47,432
It will be expensive, right?

38
00:01:47,432 --> 00:01:48,932
- It looks very expensive. - Shall we ask...

39
00:01:48,932 --> 00:01:49,932
how much it costs for a night?

40
00:01:50,532 --> 00:01:52,432
Shall I ask, "How much for one day?"

41
00:01:53,632 --> 00:01:56,532
This hotel is nice and clean. It will be nice to sleep here.

42
00:01:57,032 --> 00:01:58,032
Excuse me.

43
00:01:59,502 --> 00:02:03,032
Hello. How much is it for one room for a day?

44
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,132
"Supreme corner room".

45
00:02:06,132 --> 00:02:09,862
(Even the cheapest room costs 260 dollars.)

46
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:12,532
(Seok Jin is in a dilemma.)

47
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:13,632
There is a hamburger joint.

48
00:02:13,662 --> 00:02:15,132
Shouldn't we wait for Seok Jin?

49
00:02:15,132 --> 00:02:17,802
He will come. The bun is black.

50
00:02:17,932 --> 00:02:20,132
- Maybe it uses squid ink. - How much does it cost?

51
00:02:20,602 --> 00:02:23,032
We should buy a hamburger...

52
00:02:23,032 --> 00:02:25,132
and divide it among the three of us.

53
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:28,472
Then we can have a meal. What do you think?

54
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:30,432
Ji Hyo. Ji Hyo.

55
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:34,932
Please exempt So Min and me.

56
00:02:34,932 --> 00:02:36,632
(Thank you, Jae Seok.)

57
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:37,632
Also...

58
00:02:37,632 --> 00:02:39,832
(Also)

59
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:41,432
If you must choose one, exempt me.

60
00:02:41,432 --> 00:02:44,562
(If you must choose one, exempt me.)

61
00:02:44,562 --> 00:02:46,132
(Thank you, Jae Seok.)

62
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,162
- Okay? - Ji Hyo.

63
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:48,462
Ji Hyo.

64
00:02:48,662 --> 00:02:50,562
"If you must choose one, exempt me."

65
00:02:50,732 --> 00:02:52,762
- He wants to be exempt. - So Min should go.

66
00:02:52,762 --> 00:02:54,062
She should experience it.

67
00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:55,632
No, I will seriously...

68
00:02:55,632 --> 00:02:56,832
pee my pants.

69
00:02:57,932 --> 00:03:00,102
Can you not say things like that?

70
00:03:00,102 --> 00:03:02,662
- But I get scared really easily. - I could really pee my pants.

71
00:03:03,362 --> 00:03:05,332
- I know. - He's back.

72
00:03:05,432 --> 00:03:06,862
- How much is it? - It won't work.

73
00:03:07,432 --> 00:03:09,932
- How much? - We have about 500 dollars left,

74
00:03:10,402 --> 00:03:11,762
but it's 250 dollars.

75
00:03:11,762 --> 00:03:13,032
- Goodness. - Seriously?

76
00:03:13,032 --> 00:03:14,732
For two rooms.

77
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,702
But they offered discounts.

78
00:03:18,062 --> 00:03:19,202
(Do luxurious hotels offer discounts?)

79
00:03:19,202 --> 00:03:20,702
It went from 230 dollars to 150 dollars.

80
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:23,502
(Just in case,)

81
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:25,402
(he asked for a discount.)

82
00:03:25,932 --> 00:03:27,702
- Excuse me? - Any discounts?

83
00:03:29,462 --> 00:03:31,402
(If that's the case)

84
00:03:31,402 --> 00:03:32,602
- Two? - Yes.

85
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:34,702
Let's see.

86
00:03:35,402 --> 00:03:37,432
150 dollars? It's affordable.

87
00:03:37,432 --> 00:03:39,502
(We'll give you a huge discount.)

88
00:03:39,502 --> 00:03:41,202
But for 2 rooms, it's still 250 dollars.

89
00:03:41,202 --> 00:03:42,402
(It's still expensive.)

90
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:45,262
(Shall I grab some candies and leave?)

91
00:03:45,262 --> 00:03:46,902
We have to save as much as possible.

92
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:48,532
Free internet is available.

93
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,432
- Free internet? - Yes.

94
00:03:50,432 --> 00:03:51,562
(Poor traveler is busy taking candies.)

95
00:03:51,562 --> 00:03:53,402
Okay.

96
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:56,332
- I'll go discuss with my friends. - Do you know?

97
00:03:57,102 --> 00:03:59,132
- Then we'll come back again. - Okay.

98
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:00,362
Thank you.

99
00:04:01,802 --> 00:04:04,632
- He asked for discounts at a hotel. - It's 250 dollars.

100
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,032
But it really worked.

101
00:04:06,432 --> 00:04:08,132
He didn't even hesitate.

102
00:04:08,202 --> 00:04:09,202
Careful.

103
00:04:09,202 --> 00:04:11,002
- Ji Hyo. - How about we...

104
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:12,632
- try this? - Let's try this burger.

105
00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:14,002
It looks delicious.

106
00:04:14,002 --> 00:04:15,932
- Let's share. - It's five cents.

107
00:04:15,932 --> 00:04:17,362
- Let's buy some and share. - Sure.

108
00:04:18,202 --> 00:04:20,602
(During the 13th century, Genghis Khan searched for food...)

109
00:04:20,602 --> 00:04:23,062
(which could be eaten on horses.)

110
00:04:23,102 --> 00:04:26,002
(He came up with the idea of flattening lamb crumbs,)

111
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:28,862
(and it became the first try of patties.)

112
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:31,402
(Am I too dark?)

113
00:04:31,402 --> 00:04:32,602
Excuse me.

114
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:35,562
Can I have one black burger?

115
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:36,602
Feel free to speak in Korean.

116
00:04:36,602 --> 00:04:37,772
Are you Korean?

117
00:04:38,732 --> 00:04:40,332
- You're Mongolian? - But you're so good.

118
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:41,532
(He studied at a university in Korea.)

119
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,332
I graduated from a Korean university.

120
00:04:43,832 --> 00:04:45,102
That's where you graduated?

121
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,162
I almost thought you were Korean.

122
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,002
Then we will have two orders of single black burger.

123
00:04:49,802 --> 00:04:51,102
Those black buns look fascinating.

124
00:04:51,462 --> 00:04:53,772
- They do. - Before we head out,

125
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:57,802
let's ask him where we can find nomads.

126
00:04:58,402 --> 00:04:59,402
- Is that right? - Yes.

127
00:04:59,772 --> 00:05:02,102
Why don't we just call it a day and go to a hotel?

128
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,772
(Ji Hyo, I'm a bit tired.)

129
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:04,862
We're all tired.

130
00:05:05,062 --> 00:05:06,362
- 8:30am tomorrow. - Let's end it for today.

131
00:05:06,632 --> 00:05:09,402
We won't be going anywhere even if we find something out today.

132
00:05:09,402 --> 00:05:12,062
(Jae Seok, I guess you want to go to the Labyrinth.)

133
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,332
Look.

134
00:05:13,332 --> 00:05:15,502
She's being way too strict.

135
00:05:15,602 --> 00:05:16,662
Okay.

136
00:05:16,662 --> 00:05:18,002
(Don't forget to be nice to me in Mongolia.)

137
00:05:18,002 --> 00:05:19,102
She records on everything.

138
00:05:20,032 --> 00:05:21,462
(For black burgers)

139
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:23,062
They're all wearing black gloves.

140
00:05:23,062 --> 00:05:24,162
Look.

141
00:05:24,162 --> 00:05:25,332
Isn't that interesting?

142
00:05:25,332 --> 00:05:26,462
Look here.

143
00:05:26,962 --> 00:05:28,462
They're wearing gloves.

144
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,002
- Black burger... - Do we have to?

145
00:05:31,002 --> 00:05:34,832
- We're wearing black gloves. - We need to follow their rules.

146
00:05:34,832 --> 00:05:36,532
This is actually fun.

147
00:05:36,532 --> 00:05:38,562
- It's fun. - I wiped my hands for nothing.

148
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:41,032
It's so funny that it's also black.

149
00:05:41,462 --> 00:05:44,362
- These gloves... - Let's wear them for milking sheep.

150
00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:47,502
What do you think?

151
00:05:47,502 --> 00:05:48,902
- Look. - Well...

152
00:05:48,902 --> 00:05:50,462
Let's keep these gloves for later.

153
00:05:50,802 --> 00:05:54,662
Or we could ask for extra gloves and use them for tomorrow.

154
00:05:54,662 --> 00:05:56,402
- Black burger. - What do you think?

155
00:05:56,402 --> 00:05:58,332
- Thank you. - Thank you.

156
00:05:58,632 --> 00:05:59,732
Gosh.

157
00:05:59,732 --> 00:06:00,962
(Dropping)

158
00:06:01,732 --> 00:06:02,832
(So Min never lets us down.)

159
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:04,402
- Gosh. - Try them. It's delicious.

160
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:06,532
I've never tasted anything like this before.

161
00:06:08,262 --> 00:06:09,332
It's sweet.

162
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:10,802
- Is that so? - Yes.

163
00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:12,802
It reminds me of that.

164
00:06:12,802 --> 00:06:14,832
- It's delicious. - It's a Mongolian hamburger.

165
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:19,332
(Its taste is totally different from how it looks.)

166
00:06:19,332 --> 00:06:20,932
- It's good. - It's really good.

167
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:22,632
The buns are crunchy.

168
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,432
I love the fries in Mongolia.

169
00:06:25,462 --> 00:06:27,032
- It's good. - Really.

170
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:30,862
Be careful not to bite your finger.

171
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:32,802
They're all black.

172
00:06:32,802 --> 00:06:34,302
(Both the buns and the gloves are black.)

173
00:06:34,302 --> 00:06:35,332
You might bite your hand.

174
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:40,802
- This is incredible. - It's tasty.

175
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:42,502
We came to Mongolia for the mission.

176
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,132
It's to meet a nomad who's a descendant of Genghis Khan...

177
00:06:45,132 --> 00:06:48,602
and milk their sheep.

178
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:50,832
Where should I go to meet nomads?

179
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:52,702
Terelj is the closest from here.

180
00:06:53,632 --> 00:06:55,762
- It's called Terelj. - Terelj?

181
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:57,032
Terelj?

182
00:06:57,932 --> 00:06:59,202
- Is it Terelj? - Yes.

183
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:02,202
- The person has to have this name. - What was that?

184
00:07:02,502 --> 00:07:05,102
- What was that? - Bourgeois?

185
00:07:05,102 --> 00:07:07,362
- What? - That means "middle-class".

186
00:07:07,602 --> 00:07:09,162
- That's very irrelevant. - What was that?

187
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:11,062
- Borjigit. - Borjigit.

188
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,862
(Of course, he knows.)

189
00:07:13,862 --> 00:07:15,632
- So it's the correct name. - I'm from the Borjigit.

190
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:20,062
(Did they meet a Borjigit already?)

191
00:07:20,062 --> 00:07:23,102
- Really? - Yes.

192
00:07:23,602 --> 00:07:27,702
By any chance, does any one of your family members run a sheep farm?

193
00:07:27,702 --> 00:07:29,362
(If his family is a nomad, they get to clear the mission in one day.)

194
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:35,802
(Will they be able to meet a nomad right away?)

195
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:39,262
- No. - Oh, I see.

196
00:07:39,862 --> 00:07:41,232
Where should we go to look for them?

197
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:43,332
- Where? - Yes.

198
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:44,832
He said there's a place an hour away.

199
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:48,162
(They decide to move to Terelj.)

200
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:49,932
- Really? - Yes.

201
00:07:49,932 --> 00:07:53,162
(They drive across the vast plains, looking for a Borjigit.)

202
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:56,432
(Running Man runs in the vast wilderness.)

203
00:07:57,262 --> 00:08:00,502
(The possibilities are low, but they won't give up.)

204
00:08:00,502 --> 00:08:04,702
(They search everywhere.)

205
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:09,802
(Their journey doesn't go the way they want.)

206
00:08:10,232 --> 00:08:14,402
(Will Team Ji Hyo get to meet a Borjigit nomad?)

207
00:08:14,402 --> 00:08:15,732
- Right? - Are you the one?

208
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:18,832
- Are you a Borjigit? - Goodness.

209
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,002
Wasn't the burger great?

210
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:22,902
- It was. - We made a perfect choice.

211
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,802
Let's just go to the Korean restaurant.

212
00:08:24,862 --> 00:08:27,132
Why would you have Korean food when you're in Mongolia?

213
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,332
His taste really doesn't go with mine.

214
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:31,632
- There's another restaurant. - It's a restaurant.

215
00:08:31,632 --> 00:08:33,102
(They find another restaurant nearby.)

216
00:08:33,102 --> 00:08:34,802
- It smells like lamb meat. - They sell food.

217
00:08:34,802 --> 00:08:37,202
- It's a restaurant. - They sell food.

218
00:08:37,432 --> 00:08:38,802
What's lamb meat in English again?

219
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:39,872
Come this way.

220
00:08:41,872 --> 00:08:44,602
Let's order a dish and share.

221
00:08:46,062 --> 00:08:48,502
We have enough money. Let's just have as much as we want.

222
00:08:49,202 --> 00:08:51,762
(What did you say?)

223
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:57,162
We have to eat breakfast tomorrow morning too. We have to save money.

224
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:01,932
Your taste really doesn't get along with mine. This is not great.

225
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:03,532
- Ji Hyo. - Goodness.

226
00:09:03,532 --> 00:09:05,532
Just send him to Japan first.

227
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:08,262
- He doesn't need to milk sheep. - Our tastes really don't meet.

228
00:09:09,102 --> 00:09:10,702
Soo Yeon, I'm saying this since Jong Kook isn't here.

229
00:09:10,702 --> 00:09:12,002
Who is Soo Yeon?

230
00:09:12,002 --> 00:09:13,902
- It's her real name. - I'm so confused.

231
00:09:13,902 --> 00:09:16,262
Call me Ji Hyo, please.

232
00:09:16,262 --> 00:09:17,502
- I see. Ji Hyo. - Or team leader.

233
00:09:17,502 --> 00:09:19,502
- Team Leader Ji Hyo. - He calls you that to tease you.

234
00:09:19,502 --> 00:09:22,402
- So Min, do you have another name? - No.

235
00:09:22,932 --> 00:09:25,102
My family calls me Parrot.

236
00:09:25,302 --> 00:09:27,462
- What? - My dad thinks I'm too talkative.

237
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,732
I see you're the same at home too.

238
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:32,902
- It's good. - It's a city.

239
00:09:33,732 --> 00:09:35,802
(She can chat about anything.)

240
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,632
It's like we're exploring the world by walking.

241
00:09:38,632 --> 00:09:39,872
Right, wearing a backpack.

242
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:41,302
There are so many people here.

243
00:09:41,302 --> 00:09:42,332
Right.

244
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:44,762
(Parrot So Min doesn't let you down in Mongolia either.)

245
00:09:44,762 --> 00:09:46,562
I see you're the same at home too.

246
00:09:47,062 --> 00:09:49,632
- Let's order food now. - Let's do that.

247
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:51,702
Now, you can order food.

248
00:09:51,702 --> 00:09:54,602
But before that, we'll give you a mission.

249
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:56,232
We can't eat in peace.

250
00:09:56,532 --> 00:09:58,302
- Seriously. - We came all the way here.

251
00:09:58,302 --> 00:09:59,932
The real mission starts tomorrow.

252
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,062
Let's just eat.

253
00:10:01,062 --> 00:10:03,372
- I'm tired. - When can we use the Chance Card?

254
00:10:03,372 --> 00:10:05,632
You will get to use it tomorrow.

255
00:10:05,632 --> 00:10:07,632
Oh, right. I almost forgot about it.

256
00:10:07,802 --> 00:10:12,602
This is my first time being in a team with a Chance Card.

257
00:10:14,732 --> 00:10:15,732
Because...

258
00:10:15,872 --> 00:10:17,162
- Gosh. - Hey.

259
00:10:17,162 --> 00:10:18,962
You keep throwing dirt on our names.

260
00:10:18,962 --> 00:10:21,002
- You just talked bad about us. - You found Suzuki...

261
00:10:21,302 --> 00:10:23,002
because of us.

262
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:25,202
You're right, but still, it's my first time.

263
00:10:25,202 --> 00:10:26,432
So you're laughing at us.

264
00:10:26,432 --> 00:10:28,432
Not at all. I respect you.

265
00:10:28,432 --> 00:10:29,432
- Ji Hyo. - The other team.

266
00:10:29,432 --> 00:10:30,832
I wonder what the other team is doing.

267
00:10:30,832 --> 00:10:32,302
It's useless to know. Stop it.

268
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:34,532
- Don't change the subject to them. - Let the show focus only on us.

269
00:10:34,532 --> 00:10:36,162
- I wanted to do it. - They're going to stop filming.

270
00:10:36,162 --> 00:10:37,962
- So Min, stop. - What are they doing?

271
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:39,262
(What is the other team doing?)

272
00:10:39,262 --> 00:10:42,232
- What are the other teams up to? - Up to?

273
00:10:42,232 --> 00:10:44,402
(It's the pose they did in Japan.)

274
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:46,002
(What is the other team up to?)

275
00:10:46,002 --> 00:10:47,832
- Hey. - Stop that.

276
00:10:47,832 --> 00:10:49,102
They're going to start filming them.

277
00:10:49,102 --> 00:10:51,562
- Let us be the main characters. - Let the show focus only on us.

278
00:10:51,562 --> 00:10:52,832
There's no need to wonder.

279
00:10:52,832 --> 00:10:54,132
- All right. - Let's hear him.

280
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:56,062
- So... - Give us the menu.

281
00:10:56,062 --> 00:10:58,462
I'll tell you a Mongolian custom.

282
00:10:58,632 --> 00:11:01,132
Here, you shouldn't have leftover food.

283
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:04,032
- So... - I saw a Mongolian customer...

284
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:05,962
leave food.

285
00:11:05,962 --> 00:11:07,332
- I saw it too. - Right?

286
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:10,232
- They left some of the bun. - What are you talking about?

287
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:12,202
I thought that was their gloves.

288
00:11:12,202 --> 00:11:14,302
(The leftovers were a lot that he thought they were gloves.)

289
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:15,762
You went too far.

290
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:17,462
- I'm serious. - Stop that.

291
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:20,002
I was confused if it were the food or the gloves.

292
00:11:20,002 --> 00:11:22,202
Don't add to my comments.

293
00:11:22,202 --> 00:11:23,402
We're having a conversation here.

294
00:11:23,402 --> 00:11:25,802
Anyway, I was confused.

295
00:11:25,802 --> 00:11:27,402
So the mission is...

296
00:11:27,402 --> 00:11:31,062
called No Leftovers. This is your mission.

297
00:11:31,062 --> 00:11:32,202
So we have to eat them all.

298
00:11:32,332 --> 00:11:35,532
You can order one dish per person.

299
00:11:35,532 --> 00:11:38,132
But the menu is written in Mongolian.

300
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:41,502
(The menu is written in Mongolian.)

301
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:43,402
The staff will pay half the amount...

302
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:46,802
if you order a dish each and finish all the food.

303
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:48,962
- You'll pay for half. - Look.

304
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:50,732
Look for the word "lamb".

305
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:52,202
(Let's see.)

306
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:53,532
The language is...

307
00:11:54,062 --> 00:11:55,132
It says, "wow."

308
00:11:57,902 --> 00:11:59,162
I really don't know.

309
00:11:59,162 --> 00:12:02,532
(They have no idea.)

310
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:05,762
We will briefly tell you what they are.

311
00:12:05,762 --> 00:12:07,162
Among them...

312
00:12:07,162 --> 00:12:09,962
are peanuts, fish soup,

313
00:12:10,802 --> 00:12:14,462
lamb dumpling soup, and lamb noodles.

314
00:12:14,462 --> 00:12:15,862
That sounds delicious.

315
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:19,502
I don't think I can eat the noodles.

316
00:12:19,502 --> 00:12:22,162
- It'll be delicious. - I can handle grilled lamb.

317
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:24,602
- There's water. - Water?

318
00:12:25,232 --> 00:12:27,702
There's horse meat.

319
00:12:27,702 --> 00:12:28,832
(It doesn't sound familiar at all.)

320
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,462
- What is that? - I haven't had it before.

321
00:12:30,462 --> 00:12:31,832
I've never had it before.

322
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:34,062
- There's also cow liver, - Cow liver?

323
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:37,062
lamb chops, and flower bun.

324
00:12:37,862 --> 00:12:40,702
(Their dinner depends on their choices.)

325
00:12:40,702 --> 00:12:42,532
- We have to choose well. - This must be flower bun.

326
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,262
Look. It looks like it.

327
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:46,562
- No way. - Look here.

328
00:12:46,562 --> 00:12:49,162
- Stop the nonsense. - It's pronounced like it.

329
00:12:49,162 --> 00:12:52,062
- I can't read it at all. - This must be horse meat.

330
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,602
Just because it starts with an M?

331
00:12:53,762 --> 00:12:54,962
This must be it.

332
00:12:55,502 --> 00:12:56,632
(Trying to pronounce the word)

333
00:12:57,832 --> 00:13:01,862
(Mongolian is so easy, right?)

334
00:13:01,862 --> 00:13:03,662
- Can't a local... - My goodness.

335
00:13:03,662 --> 00:13:05,432
read them out once...

336
00:13:05,432 --> 00:13:06,902
- Can't you read them out for us? - for us?

337
00:13:06,902 --> 00:13:07,902
Number one.

338
00:13:08,632 --> 00:13:09,762
- That must be dumplings. - That must be dumplings.

339
00:13:09,762 --> 00:13:10,862
Number two.

340
00:13:10,932 --> 00:13:12,632
(Number 2)

341
00:13:12,662 --> 00:13:15,802
(What is that?)

342
00:13:16,432 --> 00:13:17,502
Number three.

343
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:19,902
(Number 3)

344
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,662
(What did you say?)

345
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,302
Number four.

346
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:27,702
(The more they hear, the more confused they become.)

347
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,502
Number seven.

348
00:13:30,632 --> 00:13:31,632
Number eight.

349
00:13:31,632 --> 00:13:34,262
(Number 8)

350
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:35,262
(I know this.)

351
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:36,302
I know what that means.

352
00:13:36,302 --> 00:13:37,362
- It means pine nuts. - That's a horse.

353
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:38,702
Number eight means pine nuts.

354
00:13:38,702 --> 00:13:39,832
- Which? - This.

355
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:41,762
("Camap" means pine nuts.)

356
00:13:41,762 --> 00:13:44,632
- It's pine nuts. - This must be peanuts.

357
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:46,332
I know this one.

358
00:13:46,332 --> 00:13:48,062
Then let's order it.

359
00:13:48,062 --> 00:13:49,402
(Let's order it to be safe.)

360
00:13:49,402 --> 00:13:51,732
Why would you order pine nuts? I'm hungry.

361
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,632
- I mean... - What's wrong with you?

362
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,432
Our tastes are so different.

363
00:13:55,462 --> 00:13:57,632
Why would you eat pine nuts when you're hungry?

364
00:13:57,632 --> 00:13:59,462
- We should try it. - It's because...

365
00:13:59,602 --> 00:14:01,332
if we finish it, the staff...

366
00:14:01,332 --> 00:14:03,202
- will pay half the price. - It's because they'll pay for half.

367
00:14:03,202 --> 00:14:04,432
- We should order pine nuts. - Let's order it.

368
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:06,602
I just don't understand. Why would you eat pine nuts?

369
00:14:06,602 --> 00:14:08,702
- It's our dinner. - You want lamb barbecue, right?

370
00:14:08,702 --> 00:14:10,562
- But it's not here. - I know, but...

371
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:13,362
- Here... - Just eat pine nuts.

372
00:14:13,362 --> 00:14:14,432
(Just eat pine nuts.)

373
00:14:14,432 --> 00:14:15,502
Why?

374
00:14:15,502 --> 00:14:17,302
- Just eat them. - It sounds like a curse word.

375
00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:20,202
On the way here, udders got us in trouble.

376
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:24,132
(In the middle of Mongolia,)

377
00:14:24,132 --> 00:14:26,302
(she shouted the word, "udders".)

378
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:28,662
Now, it's pine nuts.

379
00:14:28,662 --> 00:14:31,632
- It's pine nuts now. - Why would you eat pine nuts?

380
00:14:31,632 --> 00:14:33,032
You guys are ridiculous.

381
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:35,432
We should have something good. What's wrong with you?

382
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:37,832
Then let's do this.

383
00:14:37,832 --> 00:14:40,102
- Let's all choose one dish. - Okay.

384
00:14:40,232 --> 00:14:41,802
Number five sounds like barbecue.

385
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:43,432
I'd choose either number 2 or number 5.

386
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:45,502
I choose number five.

387
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:47,062
Ji Hyo, choose one.

388
00:14:47,062 --> 00:14:48,562
I choose number one.

389
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,002
- Number one? - Yes.

390
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:51,732
Think carefully.

391
00:14:51,732 --> 00:14:53,562
- Don't order horse meat. - This is hard.

392
00:14:53,562 --> 00:14:54,962
Don't order water either.

393
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:56,532
Number four.

394
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,362
Okay, number six.

395
00:15:00,362 --> 00:15:04,802
You've chosen numbers 1, 4, 5, and 6.

396
00:15:04,802 --> 00:15:06,462
- Okay. - The order has been made.

397
00:15:06,602 --> 00:15:09,962
We'll let you know which is which when the food is ready.

398
00:15:09,962 --> 00:15:11,102
The order has been made.

399
00:15:11,102 --> 00:15:13,162
I hope I won't get horse meat.

400
00:15:13,402 --> 00:15:15,532
While waiting for your food,

401
00:15:15,662 --> 00:15:17,962
do you want to learn how to play the Mongolian rock-paper-scissors?

402
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:18,962
How do you play it?

403
00:15:18,962 --> 00:15:21,702
The rules are same as Korean game. You play it with your fingers.

404
00:15:21,832 --> 00:15:23,862
You show one of your fingers at a time.

405
00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:27,802
Thumb beats index finger.

406
00:15:28,132 --> 00:15:30,802
Index finger beats middle fingers.

407
00:15:30,802 --> 00:15:32,902
(There's a hierarchy between fingers next to each other.)

408
00:15:32,902 --> 00:15:34,132
(In other cases, the game is tied.)

409
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:36,502
Each finger can beat the finger next to it.

410
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,402
- Let's try it. Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

411
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:40,532
- 1, 2, 3. - 3.

412
00:15:41,362 --> 00:15:42,462
(Little finger beats thumb.)

413
00:15:42,462 --> 00:15:43,902
- I win. - You win.

414
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:44,932
Yes.

415
00:15:44,932 --> 00:15:47,302
- Little finger beats thumb? - Exactly.

416
00:15:47,302 --> 00:15:49,732
- Ji Hyo, play it with me. - Each finger beats the next finger.

417
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:51,462
- You can say rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

418
00:15:51,462 --> 00:15:52,462
(It's a practice round.)

419
00:15:52,462 --> 00:15:55,232
(Shocked)

420
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:57,362
(It's just a game, but it is still offensive.)

421
00:15:57,362 --> 00:15:59,262
- You win. - You win.

422
00:15:59,262 --> 00:16:01,262
Ji Hyo, that was offensive.

423
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:03,202
How could you show that finger?

424
00:16:04,032 --> 00:16:05,502
You're unbelievable.

425
00:16:05,862 --> 00:16:07,762
- You wanted to win so much? - It's just a game.

426
00:16:07,762 --> 00:16:09,432
It's just a game.

427
00:16:09,432 --> 00:16:10,702
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

428
00:16:10,702 --> 00:16:12,302
(It's just a fun game.)

429
00:16:14,032 --> 00:16:16,162
- Hey. - I don't think we should play this.

430
00:16:16,162 --> 00:16:18,032
We shouldn't play Mongolian rock-paper-scissors.

431
00:16:18,032 --> 00:16:19,962
- It hurts my feelings. - I can't do this.

432
00:16:21,232 --> 00:16:23,802
Seok Jin, rock-paper-scissors.

433
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:25,932
- You win. - I won. Give me your hand.

434
00:16:25,932 --> 00:16:27,002
(Jae Seok wins.)

435
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,332
(Moving)

436
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:36,762
What was that?

437
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,432
- Why did you hit me? - Why did you hit him?

438
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:40,602
I just wanted to.

439
00:16:40,602 --> 00:16:42,532
- Why did you do that? - Why did you do that?

440
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,962
- I just... - That was so unexpected.

441
00:16:45,062 --> 00:16:47,062
- I was just looking at them. - Why did you do that?

442
00:16:47,102 --> 00:16:48,762
That's why she's...

443
00:16:48,762 --> 00:16:52,432
He kept moving his hand. That's why I wanted to hit it.

444
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:55,032
Our food must be ready.

445
00:16:55,032 --> 00:16:56,402
- It's coming. - It's coming.

446
00:16:58,062 --> 00:17:00,702
(Will they finish their food and pay only half the price?)

447
00:17:00,702 --> 00:17:01,762
I'm worried.

448
00:17:01,762 --> 00:17:03,302
(Will it be a painful dinner?)

449
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:05,102
The first dish will be served.

450
00:17:05,102 --> 00:17:06,262
Which number is it?

451
00:17:06,262 --> 00:17:10,702
(Will their order turn out to be successful?)

452
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,302
(The youthful city, Vladivostok, Russia.)

453
00:17:14,302 --> 00:17:15,802
I want to get something to eat.

454
00:17:16,262 --> 00:17:17,932
Should we find a place?

455
00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:19,232
- Sure. - Let's take a break.

456
00:17:19,232 --> 00:17:20,502
(They want to get something to eat.)

457
00:17:20,502 --> 00:17:22,502
It's pork, chicken...

458
00:17:22,502 --> 00:17:24,462
- What is this? - Hello.

459
00:17:25,632 --> 00:17:26,962
(They found a kebab place.)

460
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,802
- It's kebab. - It's kebab.

461
00:17:28,932 --> 00:17:31,032
(He recommends a dish.)

462
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:32,262
They sell dumplings.

463
00:17:32,262 --> 00:17:34,072
It says, "It's hot," in Korean.

464
00:17:34,072 --> 00:17:35,962
Wait. It's from Korea.

465
00:17:35,962 --> 00:17:37,462
It says, "It's hot."

466
00:17:37,462 --> 00:17:39,532
- It's from Korea. - It's from Korea.

467
00:17:39,632 --> 00:17:41,702
Let's try their dumplings. It seems famous.

468
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:43,602
Should we get kebabs and dumplings?

469
00:17:43,602 --> 00:17:45,762
(They order kebabs and dumplings.)

470
00:17:46,702 --> 00:17:48,332
Where should we sit? Let's find a nice place.

471
00:17:48,332 --> 00:17:49,632
- What about over there? - Sure.

472
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,402
- Let's make a toast. - Okay.

473
00:17:52,662 --> 00:17:53,702
With our kebabs.

474
00:17:53,702 --> 00:17:56,032
Regardless of the mission,

475
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:58,262
I'm happy to be in Russia with you guys.

476
00:17:58,502 --> 00:18:00,802
- Thank you. - Thank you.

477
00:18:00,802 --> 00:18:01,862
(Thank you, Jong Kook.)

478
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:03,202
Let's complete our mission.

479
00:18:04,402 --> 00:18:07,702
(They munch their food without saying many words.)

480
00:18:07,702 --> 00:18:08,732
It tastes good.

481
00:18:09,502 --> 00:18:12,132
(Jong Kook seems to be pleased too.)

482
00:18:12,802 --> 00:18:14,202
(Seagulls)

483
00:18:14,202 --> 00:18:15,262
(Our captain is having a meal.)

484
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,332
Go away!

485
00:18:17,002 --> 00:18:19,162
The seagulls have eyes on our food. Be careful.

486
00:18:19,262 --> 00:18:20,572
What is this?

487
00:18:20,802 --> 00:18:21,862
(They have eyes on the dumplings.)

488
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:22,962
What?

489
00:18:22,962 --> 00:18:24,502
Do they eat these? I don't think so.

490
00:18:25,702 --> 00:18:27,802
Hey, you shouldn't feed them.

491
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:29,802
(Out of curiosity, Kwang Soo throws a piece of dumpling.)

492
00:18:29,802 --> 00:18:31,102
(The seagull approaches.)

493
00:18:31,102 --> 00:18:32,302
They'll keep coming.

494
00:18:32,302 --> 00:18:33,362
You shouldn't do that.

495
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,462
Hey, what are you doing?

496
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:36,532
(Everyone loves dumplings.)

497
00:18:37,602 --> 00:18:39,102
(Just then)

498
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:41,332
(Screaming)

499
00:18:42,102 --> 00:18:43,572
They're all coming here.

500
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:46,902
Gosh, it's your fault.

501
00:18:48,232 --> 00:18:51,202
(Kwang Soo, it's your fault.)

502
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:53,332
You shouldn't feed them salty food.

503
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,602
Gosh! Hey!

504
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:59,232
Gosh, what is this?

505
00:19:00,462 --> 00:19:01,532
(Kwang Soo is surprised too.)

506
00:19:01,532 --> 00:19:03,362
Why did you do that, Kwang Soo?

507
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:08,102
(Kwang Soo communicates with animals even in Russia.)

508
00:19:09,132 --> 00:19:10,572
I'm sending you to Japan.

509
00:19:10,572 --> 00:19:12,402
Book your flight ticket now.

510
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,032
- Jong Kook. - Book your flight ticket now.

511
00:19:14,032 --> 00:19:15,962
He's so annoying. I can't stand him anymore.

512
00:19:17,102 --> 00:19:18,802
- I've decided. - Okay.

513
00:19:18,802 --> 00:19:20,302
(It's decided that Kwang Soo is going to Japan.)

514
00:19:20,362 --> 00:19:21,402
Okay, it's decided.

515
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,962
- It can change, right? - What?

516
00:19:24,402 --> 00:19:26,032
Tell me right now if it's unchangeable.

517
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:28,462
(His attitude has changed.)

518
00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:29,862
What is that supposed to mean?

519
00:19:30,732 --> 00:19:32,332
- It's unchangeable. - It is?

520
00:19:32,802 --> 00:19:35,802
- It's unchangeable? - His attitude is so bad.

521
00:19:35,802 --> 00:19:37,702
- Stop it. - Is it really unchangeable?

522
00:19:39,302 --> 00:19:41,032
Is it unchangeable?

523
00:19:41,402 --> 00:19:42,502
It can change, right?

524
00:19:42,802 --> 00:19:44,332
Look at him.

525
00:19:44,432 --> 00:19:45,732
It can change, right?

526
00:19:46,002 --> 00:19:47,132
Of course.

527
00:19:47,462 --> 00:19:48,962
- Okay. - Don't act up.

528
00:19:48,962 --> 00:19:50,902
- Okay. - You're losing your points.

529
00:19:52,202 --> 00:19:53,602
- Our guide. - Yes.

530
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:54,732
What are we supposed to do?

531
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:56,702
I think we should ask this.

532
00:19:57,002 --> 00:19:59,262
(Stammering)

533
00:19:59,602 --> 00:20:01,632
- What does that mean? - Where are fishing boats?

534
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:05,072
- Where are fishing boats? - You're well prepared.

535
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:07,902
I'll find pictures of king crabs...

536
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:09,332
- and show them. - Okay.

537
00:20:09,702 --> 00:20:11,072
I like this about you.

538
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:14,102
Are you...

539
00:20:14,102 --> 00:20:15,802
- in that position? - What do you mean?

540
00:20:15,802 --> 00:20:17,302
Aren't you on the same level as us?

541
00:20:17,702 --> 00:20:19,262
It's not like that.

542
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:22,002
Don't you see I'm sitting next to Jong Kook?

543
00:20:22,572 --> 00:20:23,762
Remember the rank.

544
00:20:25,802 --> 00:20:28,002
What is that supposed to mean?

545
00:20:28,002 --> 00:20:29,362
(You've been getting on my nerves.)

546
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:31,432
"What is that supposed to mean?"

547
00:20:32,072 --> 00:20:33,162
What are you talking about?

548
00:20:33,162 --> 00:20:34,702
- Remember the rank. - What rank?

549
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:37,102
Pull yourselves together.

550
00:20:37,262 --> 00:20:39,402
You pull yourself together.

551
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:41,662
(You pull yourself together.)

552
00:20:41,662 --> 00:20:42,762
You might regret later.

553
00:20:42,762 --> 00:20:43,902
(Let's see who wins.)

554
00:20:43,902 --> 00:20:47,202
We should ask directions.

555
00:20:47,202 --> 00:20:49,502
Why don't we ask the man who was kind to us?

556
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:50,762
- The kebab guy? - The kebab guy?

557
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:52,902
- He was so kind. - We bought their food too.

558
00:20:52,902 --> 00:20:54,432
- Let's go. - Okay, let's go.

559
00:20:54,432 --> 00:20:55,432
(Jong Kook's word is law.)

560
00:20:55,432 --> 00:20:57,402
- Let's go and ask. - Excuse me.

561
00:20:57,532 --> 00:20:59,832
- What should we say? - Show him the pictures.

562
00:20:59,832 --> 00:21:01,132
How do you say, "Please help?"

563
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:04,132
(Please help.)

564
00:21:05,602 --> 00:21:07,902
(He asks the question he prepared.)

565
00:21:07,902 --> 00:21:10,902
(What is he saying?)

566
00:21:11,862 --> 00:21:13,902
- King crabs. - King crabs.

567
00:21:13,902 --> 00:21:16,402
(They have to use gestures.)

568
00:21:16,402 --> 00:21:18,502
(They explain fishing with gestures, while saying, "king crabs".)

569
00:21:18,502 --> 00:21:19,962
(Do you understand?)

570
00:21:19,962 --> 00:21:22,302
- King crabs. - King crabs.

571
00:21:22,302 --> 00:21:23,902
(He suddenly nods.)

572
00:21:24,902 --> 00:21:26,102
Moscow?

573
00:21:27,532 --> 00:21:28,602
He recommends Russky Island.

574
00:21:28,602 --> 00:21:30,332
- Russky Island? - An island?

575
00:21:30,572 --> 00:21:32,532
Russky Island?

576
00:21:32,532 --> 00:21:35,262
- How do we get there? - A boat?

577
00:21:35,262 --> 00:21:36,902
- How do we get there? - A boat?

578
00:21:37,402 --> 00:21:41,332
(Is there a boat near here?)

579
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,072
(What does his gesture mean?)

580
00:21:44,072 --> 00:21:45,362
What does that mean?

581
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:46,702
You can get there by car.

582
00:21:46,702 --> 00:21:49,332
We can get to the island by car?

583
00:21:49,332 --> 00:21:52,002
- Okay. Thank you. - Thank you.

584
00:21:52,002 --> 00:21:53,262
(Let's try.)

585
00:21:53,902 --> 00:21:56,802
(They're on their way to the king crab fishing boats.)

586
00:21:57,102 --> 00:21:59,202
Does any of you want to freshen up your mouth?

587
00:21:59,202 --> 00:22:00,362
- Me. - Okay.

588
00:22:00,502 --> 00:22:01,532
- Me too. - Tell me.

589
00:22:01,532 --> 00:22:02,532
- Why? - Are you good?

590
00:22:02,732 --> 00:22:04,132
- Why? - I brought something.

591
00:22:04,262 --> 00:22:05,362
What did you bring?

592
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:08,562
- What's that? - It's chewable toothbrushes.

593
00:22:09,132 --> 00:22:10,732
- Chewable toothbrushes? - Chewable toothbrushes.

594
00:22:12,002 --> 00:22:14,562
(When they visited Se Chan's place,)

595
00:22:14,562 --> 00:22:19,332
(Ji Hyo got him chewable toothbrushes.)

596
00:22:19,332 --> 00:22:20,802
(No one expected they'd come in handy someday.)

597
00:22:20,802 --> 00:22:21,862
- I like it. - I brought them from home.

598
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:23,762
- You still have them? - They're new.

599
00:22:23,762 --> 00:22:25,062
I like it.

600
00:22:25,062 --> 00:22:26,832
- I'm well prepared... - Se Chan is great.

601
00:22:26,832 --> 00:22:27,902
as the youngest member.

602
00:22:28,762 --> 00:22:30,202
You might not go to Japan.

603
00:22:30,202 --> 00:22:31,262
Thank you.

604
00:22:32,232 --> 00:22:36,302
Se Chan cares about every member so much.

605
00:22:36,302 --> 00:22:39,702
In addition to the toothbrushes, he even brought the waxing cream...

606
00:22:39,902 --> 00:22:41,632
for us.

607
00:22:41,632 --> 00:22:42,862
- I saw it. - Really?

608
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,002
- We can them tonight. - Foot packs?

609
00:22:44,002 --> 00:22:47,502
I have the foot packs, and I also brought mask packs...

610
00:22:47,502 --> 00:22:49,202
to hydrate our skin.

611
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,002
- I brought four aloe mask packs. - We can sleep after using them.

612
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:52,602
Please give me a big hand.

613
00:22:53,562 --> 00:22:55,002
He's very good at these things.

614
00:22:55,002 --> 00:22:57,432
- He's like that. - I agree.

615
00:22:57,702 --> 00:23:01,062
That's enough, okay?

616
00:23:02,102 --> 00:23:03,602
You aren't Jong Kook.

617
00:23:03,602 --> 00:23:05,132
We're of the same rank.

618
00:23:05,232 --> 00:23:07,432
Why do you keep bossing me around?

619
00:23:07,432 --> 00:23:08,832
I don't like your attitude.

620
00:23:09,102 --> 00:23:10,102
Not mine, right?

621
00:23:10,202 --> 00:23:11,602
Speak to me with respect.

622
00:23:11,602 --> 00:23:12,862
Stop it, Haha.

623
00:23:12,862 --> 00:23:14,802
- Respect the hierarchy. - What hierarchy?

624
00:23:14,802 --> 00:23:16,902
What gives you the right?

625
00:23:16,902 --> 00:23:18,362
I'm the second best fighter.

626
00:23:19,102 --> 00:23:20,302
Come on.

627
00:23:20,302 --> 00:23:21,502
Shall we fight against him?

628
00:23:21,502 --> 00:23:23,062
- What? - We can be a team.

629
00:23:23,062 --> 00:23:24,402
You don't need to be a team.

630
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,732
- Why not? - You just don't.

631
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:30,332
It looks pretty.

632
00:23:30,332 --> 00:23:31,502
(This is Russia.)

633
00:23:31,502 --> 00:23:32,632
It's beautiful.

634
00:23:32,632 --> 00:23:33,962
It's like Europe.

635
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:35,462
This is Russia, isn't it?

636
00:23:35,462 --> 00:23:39,502
The view is more beautiful in real life than in photos.

637
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:41,132
(They enjoy the view of Vladivostok.)

638
00:23:41,262 --> 00:23:42,262
(It's amicable among the members.)

639
00:23:42,262 --> 00:23:44,862
The good weather makes everything look beautiful.

640
00:23:45,232 --> 00:23:47,002
Isn't it different from what you expected?

641
00:23:47,002 --> 00:23:49,262
- Right. - I thought it'd feel tense,

642
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:53,202
- but it's beautiful and detailed. - Things are small and cute.

643
00:23:53,602 --> 00:23:56,962
What makes you say that things are small and cute?

644
00:23:56,962 --> 00:23:58,762
- Those. - What?

645
00:24:00,062 --> 00:24:01,802
Those buildings...

646
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:03,202
- are cute. - Which ones?

647
00:24:03,202 --> 00:24:05,502
There are no large buildings.

648
00:24:05,502 --> 00:24:06,802
Isn't it because they're far away?

649
00:24:06,802 --> 00:24:08,902
- They're all big. - It's because they're far.

650
00:24:08,902 --> 00:24:10,832
Is it because they're far away?

651
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:12,862
You shouldn't talk to me like that.

652
00:24:13,562 --> 00:24:14,702
I wanted to tease you.

653
00:24:14,702 --> 00:24:16,362
- I'm sorry. - Kwang Soo.

654
00:24:16,362 --> 00:24:17,702
- I'm sorry. - Look.

655
00:24:17,702 --> 00:24:18,802
- I see something. - Gosh.

656
00:24:18,802 --> 00:24:20,262
(They arrive at Russky Island.)

657
00:24:20,402 --> 00:24:22,162
It looks nice.

658
00:24:22,162 --> 00:24:23,602
We could use any boat for fishing.

659
00:24:23,602 --> 00:24:25,862
- There are a lot. - How about the big ones?

660
00:24:25,862 --> 00:24:27,532
- I've been on a boat like that. - Me too.

661
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:29,202
- Let's get out. - Thank you.

662
00:24:29,202 --> 00:24:30,202
Thank you.

663
00:24:31,602 --> 00:24:32,602
Thank you.

664
00:24:33,002 --> 00:24:34,862
(They must rent a boat.)

665
00:24:34,862 --> 00:24:37,062
Hold on. Where's the captain?

666
00:24:37,362 --> 00:24:40,802
(It's completely deserted.)

667
00:24:41,402 --> 00:24:43,602
(Where is everyone?)

668
00:24:45,032 --> 00:24:48,362
That's the only boat possible for fishing.

669
00:24:49,102 --> 00:24:51,332
We have to catch king crab.

670
00:24:51,332 --> 00:24:52,632
(That's the only boat big enough to fish.)

671
00:24:52,632 --> 00:24:53,902
Shall we ask?

672
00:24:53,902 --> 00:24:55,502
- Let's do that. - Okay.

673
00:24:55,502 --> 00:24:56,502
Let's go.

674
00:24:56,902 --> 00:24:59,532
Shall we ask these men?

675
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:00,662
How about him?

676
00:25:00,802 --> 00:25:02,402
- Should we ask him? - Okay.

677
00:25:02,432 --> 00:25:05,332
The other boats are too small to catch king crab.

678
00:25:05,332 --> 00:25:07,062
- They're too small. - Right?

679
00:25:07,062 --> 00:25:08,802
How do we catch them?

680
00:25:08,802 --> 00:25:09,962
Is the boat equipped?

681
00:25:10,632 --> 00:25:12,962
(They say hello in Russian.)

682
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:15,502
(He always gives a friendly smile.)

683
00:25:16,302 --> 00:25:17,302
(It's a Russian captain.)

684
00:25:17,302 --> 00:25:18,862
- Let's ask him. - He looks amazing.

685
00:25:18,862 --> 00:25:21,002
- He looks great. - King crab.

686
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:22,402
(He speaks with gestures.)

687
00:25:22,502 --> 00:25:24,162
- King crab. - You look great.

688
00:25:24,162 --> 00:25:25,502
Is fishing possible?

689
00:25:25,702 --> 00:25:27,702
Is it possible to catch king crab?

690
00:25:27,702 --> 00:25:28,962
(He shows a photo.)

691
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:32,402
(Is it possible to catch king crab on this boat?)

692
00:25:32,402 --> 00:25:33,532
King crab fishing?

693
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,702
(It's possible to catch king crab with this boat.)

694
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:39,602
- King crab? - Really?

695
00:25:39,602 --> 00:25:41,962
(What does that hand gesture mean?)

696
00:25:42,202 --> 00:25:44,332
Can you ask if we can ride the boat?

697
00:25:46,702 --> 00:25:49,962
(They must catch king crab on the boat to avoid going to Japan.)

698
00:25:49,962 --> 00:25:52,532
(Will the captain permit Team Jong Kook?)

699
00:25:52,532 --> 00:25:53,862
You can get on the boat.

700
00:25:53,862 --> 00:25:55,862
- We can? - You can get on the boat.

701
00:25:55,862 --> 00:25:58,062
- We can get on the boat? - Can we catch other fish?

702
00:25:58,062 --> 00:25:59,062
Not just king crab.

703
00:25:59,062 --> 00:26:00,602
(Can you catch other types of seafood?)

704
00:26:01,902 --> 00:26:03,302
He says it's possible.

705
00:26:04,102 --> 00:26:07,002
(Team Jong Kook gets lucky and goes fishing.)

706
00:26:07,002 --> 00:26:09,162
The boat is amazing.

707
00:26:09,162 --> 00:26:11,262
- I've never been on such a boat. - Goodness.

708
00:26:11,262 --> 00:26:13,002
- This is great. - It is.

709
00:26:13,002 --> 00:26:14,702
What if we eat instant noodles here?

710
00:26:14,702 --> 00:26:16,202
- That's a good idea. - We can eat king crab.

711
00:26:16,202 --> 00:26:18,462
We can add king crab to the menu and eat outside.

712
00:26:19,132 --> 00:26:20,632
- You're the third in rank. - Why?

713
00:26:20,632 --> 00:26:22,402
- You brought instant noodles. - I did.

714
00:26:22,502 --> 00:26:24,332
- I came prepared. - You did a good job.

715
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,862
- Do you remember the mission? - Yes.

716
00:26:26,862 --> 00:26:29,162
We're off to catch...

717
00:26:29,162 --> 00:26:32,502
king crab and 10 types of seafood.

718
00:26:32,502 --> 00:26:35,362
We clear the mission if we catch king crab...

719
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:38,002
and 10 types of seafood at the same time.

720
00:26:38,002 --> 00:26:40,232
- Definitely. - Even if we catch sea snails...

721
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,262
Those count.

722
00:26:41,262 --> 00:26:43,402
You can't say they aren't a type of fish.

723
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,532
We accept anything that's edible,

724
00:26:45,532 --> 00:26:47,462
but sea snails in different shapes count as one.

725
00:26:47,462 --> 00:26:49,302
- Of course not. - Oh, come on.

726
00:26:49,432 --> 00:26:53,102
- Come on. - We're not that silly.

727
00:26:53,102 --> 00:26:54,532
Don't you know us?

728
00:26:54,532 --> 00:26:56,362
You know we aren't that silly.

729
00:26:56,362 --> 00:26:58,762
I'm telling you this because I know you guys too well.

730
00:26:58,762 --> 00:27:00,062
(He knows them too well.)

731
00:27:00,062 --> 00:27:01,802
It's because he knows us too well.

732
00:27:01,802 --> 00:27:03,502
Tomorrow,

733
00:27:03,702 --> 00:27:07,102
I don't plan to ride boats.

734
00:27:08,232 --> 00:27:10,762
It's either you go to Japan...

735
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:11,902
or clear the mission today.

736
00:27:11,902 --> 00:27:14,862
- Clear the mission today. - Did you bring gloves?

737
00:27:14,862 --> 00:27:17,532
- Why do you ask? - If not, I'll give you mine.

738
00:27:17,532 --> 00:27:19,702
No, I didn't bring gloves.

739
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:21,602
- I brought you a pair. - Thanks.

740
00:27:21,602 --> 00:27:23,232
I'll push you into the water.

741
00:27:23,232 --> 00:27:24,402
(He's so annoying.)

742
00:27:24,402 --> 00:27:27,032
Goodness, Se Chan.

743
00:27:27,102 --> 00:27:28,802
He's impressive.

744
00:27:28,802 --> 00:27:30,702
- Here you go. - You're prepared.

745
00:27:30,702 --> 00:27:33,102
- Okay. - Did you bring two pairs?

746
00:27:33,102 --> 00:27:35,302
Do you think they look good on Jong Kook?

747
00:27:35,602 --> 00:27:37,162
Did you steal your mom's?

748
00:27:37,162 --> 00:27:39,862
He looks cool like a gangster.

749
00:27:39,862 --> 00:27:40,862
A gangster?

750
00:27:41,502 --> 00:27:44,702
I didn't mean it in a bad way.

751
00:27:44,702 --> 00:27:47,102
- What did you call me? - Se Chan.

752
00:27:47,102 --> 00:27:49,532
- He holds grudges. - Do I seem like a gangster?

753
00:27:49,532 --> 00:27:51,762
That's not what I meant.

754
00:27:51,762 --> 00:27:53,762
Try the grip. Aren't they nice and tight?

755
00:27:53,762 --> 00:27:54,932
Aren't they perfect?

756
00:27:55,502 --> 00:27:57,402
- You must decide now. - Yes?

757
00:27:57,702 --> 00:27:59,202
What will you do?

758
00:27:59,202 --> 00:28:00,602
Do what? Do you have a secret plan?

759
00:28:00,602 --> 00:28:02,862
- Do what? - We don't have a secret plan.

760
00:28:03,762 --> 00:28:06,802
(2 hours ago when they went to buy Coke)

761
00:28:06,802 --> 00:28:08,962
(Kwang Soo thought it's unfair.)

762
00:28:09,862 --> 00:28:10,862
(What's wrong with him?)

763
00:28:10,862 --> 00:28:12,232
(What's so great about being a team leader?)

764
00:28:12,762 --> 00:28:14,402
(Why don't we rebel against him?)

765
00:28:14,802 --> 00:28:16,032
Will you keep obeying him?

766
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:17,702
(I can't bear it anymore.)

767
00:28:18,502 --> 00:28:21,502
(They dreamed of rebelling against the team leader.)

768
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:23,632
(What are you planning to do?)

769
00:28:23,632 --> 00:28:25,332
- We don't have a secret plan. - Do what?

770
00:28:25,332 --> 00:28:27,332
Se Chan is being annoying.

771
00:28:27,402 --> 00:28:28,402
You find him annoying?

772
00:28:30,602 --> 00:28:32,502
(Are you sure about that?)

773
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:34,502
- What do you mean? - Wait.

774
00:28:34,702 --> 00:28:35,902
Are you sure you're not a gangster?

775
00:28:35,902 --> 00:28:37,402
(Are you sure about that?)

776
00:28:38,262 --> 00:28:40,632
Either take off the gloves or the sunglasses.

777
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:42,002
Do at least one.

778
00:28:42,132 --> 00:28:44,202
Why don't you take off Lee Byung Hun's jacket?

779
00:28:44,332 --> 00:28:45,802
Do something.

780
00:28:45,802 --> 00:28:48,062
(Lee Byung Hun's jacket?)

781
00:28:48,402 --> 00:28:51,332
(Let's go to Vodka and have a glass of Vladivostok.)

782
00:28:51,902 --> 00:28:54,232
- My shoulders hurt, Jong Kook. - Really?

783
00:28:54,832 --> 00:28:55,862
How about now?

784
00:28:55,862 --> 00:28:57,062
(My members shouldn't be in pain.)

785
00:28:57,062 --> 00:28:58,062
Jong Kook.

786
00:28:58,702 --> 00:28:59,732
That feels good.

787
00:29:00,132 --> 00:29:01,902
How about yours?

788
00:29:03,202 --> 00:29:04,862
- It feels great. - Doesn't it?

789
00:29:04,862 --> 00:29:06,462
It feels so good.

790
00:29:10,202 --> 00:29:12,802
(It's 10 dollars for 30 seconds' worth of service.)

791
00:29:12,802 --> 00:29:14,702
- He's asking for money. - Are you paying him?

792
00:29:14,902 --> 00:29:16,502
- Here you go. - Great.

793
00:29:17,702 --> 00:29:20,332
- Let's go. - Let's go.

794
00:29:20,332 --> 00:29:22,762
Let's go.

795
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:24,202
Let's go.

796
00:29:24,202 --> 00:29:25,632
Let's go.

797
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,132
He's the tall one.

798
00:29:27,362 --> 00:29:28,632
- What did you say? - He's the tall one.

799
00:29:28,632 --> 00:29:30,432
- Isn't the pronunciation wrong? - You're a tall one.

800
00:29:30,432 --> 00:29:32,402
- You're the short one. - I'm the short one.

801
00:29:32,402 --> 00:29:33,902
(They mimic the Russian pronunciation.)

802
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:35,732
- He's the old one. - He's the gangster one.

803
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,802
- He's the gangster one. - He's the bad one.

804
00:29:37,802 --> 00:29:41,162
(They call him the old, gangster and bad one.)

805
00:29:41,902 --> 00:29:43,262
We were being funny.

806
00:29:43,262 --> 00:29:44,862
- Come on. - It's a joke.

807
00:29:44,862 --> 00:29:45,902
We're having fun.

808
00:29:45,902 --> 00:29:48,262
You should understand.

809
00:29:48,262 --> 00:29:49,532
Come on.

810
00:29:49,532 --> 00:29:51,132
- Let's go. - Let's go.

811
00:29:51,132 --> 00:29:52,602
(Okay, let's go.)

812
00:29:52,602 --> 00:29:54,202
I feel great.

813
00:29:54,202 --> 00:29:55,302
I feel good too.

814
00:29:55,302 --> 00:29:58,532
(Like the passing wind)

815
00:29:58,532 --> 00:30:02,232
(The silly men are excited to be in Russia.)

816
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:04,802
This is great.

817
00:30:06,102 --> 00:30:08,702
Kwang Soo is also a type of fish.

818
00:30:08,702 --> 00:30:10,062
(He's also a type of fish.)

819
00:30:11,132 --> 00:30:13,302
Didn't we catch one already?

820
00:30:13,302 --> 00:30:15,062
I'm not a fish.

821
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:17,262
Doesn't he count if we put him in the fishing trap?

822
00:30:17,262 --> 00:30:18,802
Why would I go in there?

823
00:30:18,802 --> 00:30:20,762
You should go in if we catch nine.

824
00:30:20,762 --> 00:30:22,432
What are you talking about?

825
00:30:22,632 --> 00:30:25,002
If you flap in the fishing trap, we'll accept it.

826
00:30:25,162 --> 00:30:26,402
Do I have to flap?

827
00:30:26,602 --> 00:30:28,062
- I have to flap? - Let's go.

828
00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:29,632
Let's do it.

829
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,862
- We got one already. - What?

830
00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:34,262
- Goodness. - Kwang Soo.

831
00:30:34,262 --> 00:30:36,862
- You can do it for the team. - How can I go in the fishing trap?

832
00:30:36,862 --> 00:30:38,962
- Can't you do that much for us? - I know.

833
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,302
He has to flap.

834
00:30:41,362 --> 00:30:42,702
(The boat of love...)

835
00:30:42,702 --> 00:30:44,602
(heads towards northeast.)

836
00:30:44,602 --> 00:30:46,532
It's the Russky Bridge.

837
00:30:46,902 --> 00:30:48,802
It's red, blue, and white.

838
00:30:48,802 --> 00:30:50,962
(With colors of the Russian flag, it's also called Russian Bridge.)

839
00:30:50,962 --> 00:30:53,232
This will be our memory. What should we do then?

840
00:30:53,232 --> 00:30:54,902
- We must take photos. - That's right.

841
00:30:54,902 --> 00:30:56,632
- Let's take photos. - To keep memories...

842
00:30:56,632 --> 00:30:58,402
- Take photos. - Jong Kook.

843
00:30:58,402 --> 00:30:59,902
He's in a good mood.

844
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:01,102
- To keep memories... - Take photos.

845
00:31:01,102 --> 00:31:03,262
Let's take photos.

846
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,532
(I miss home.)

847
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:06,702
- It looks great. - It does.

848
00:31:07,202 --> 00:31:09,962
- I feel great. - Isn't this good?

849
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:13,502
It's a great day. We'll get lucky and catch something.

850
00:31:15,202 --> 00:31:16,402
We're on a boat.

851
00:31:16,862 --> 00:31:18,762
(What is it this time?)

852
00:31:18,762 --> 00:31:21,632
(Doesn't he get motion sickness?)

853
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:23,202
Shall we do a scene from "Titanic"?

854
00:31:23,202 --> 00:31:24,332
- I'll do it. - I will.

855
00:31:24,332 --> 00:31:26,662
- I will. - My nickname was Kate Winslet.

856
00:31:26,662 --> 00:31:29,402
Hold on. Let's go based on the hierarchy.

857
00:31:29,432 --> 00:31:30,532
Why do you keep saying that?

858
00:31:30,532 --> 00:31:31,962
What hierarchy?

859
00:31:31,962 --> 00:31:34,002
What are you talking about?

860
00:31:34,062 --> 00:31:35,632
Who will play...

861
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:38,602
- Leonardo DiCaprio? - I'll play Kate Winslet.

862
00:31:38,602 --> 00:31:42,102
Let's reenact a scene from "Titanic".

863
00:31:42,102 --> 00:31:44,462
- That sounds good. - We need some good photos.

864
00:31:44,462 --> 00:31:45,532
- We're here after all. - You're right.

865
00:31:45,532 --> 00:31:47,632
You're always right.

866
00:31:47,632 --> 00:31:49,262
- Let's go. - Let's go.

867
00:31:49,262 --> 00:31:50,262
Let's go.

868
00:31:50,262 --> 00:31:52,202
(This is tiring.)

869
00:31:53,262 --> 00:31:54,402
This looks nice.

870
00:31:54,502 --> 00:31:56,802
"Titanic" is such an old movie.

871
00:31:56,802 --> 00:31:57,802
I know.

872
00:31:58,002 --> 00:31:59,402
It was Jong Kook's idea.

873
00:31:59,732 --> 00:32:01,262
Old people always want...

874
00:32:01,262 --> 00:32:03,202
to reenact the scene on a boat.

875
00:32:03,362 --> 00:32:04,732
- Let's try it. - Sure thing.

876
00:32:05,302 --> 00:32:06,702
I'll play Kate Winslet.

877
00:32:06,702 --> 00:32:07,962
(Leave it up to me.)

878
00:32:07,962 --> 00:32:10,062
- Kwang Soo is... - How about here?

879
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:12,232
- very sly. - Shall we stand here?

880
00:32:12,232 --> 00:32:13,902
Shall we stand here?

881
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:19,102
(Everything is ready for the scene from "Titanic".)

882
00:32:19,102 --> 00:32:20,502
Go up.

883
00:32:20,502 --> 00:32:23,332
Don't be afraid. In 3, 2, 1.

884
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:24,432
Go up.

885
00:32:24,432 --> 00:32:25,902
- I'll hold you. - Go.

886
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,962
(Kwang Soo plays Korea's Kate Winslet.)

887
00:32:28,202 --> 00:32:32,062
(It looks as good as the original movie.)

888
00:32:32,332 --> 00:32:33,532
I can't do it.

889
00:32:33,532 --> 00:32:34,862
(He gives up easily.)

890
00:32:35,462 --> 00:32:36,702
- I'm giving up. - You're giving up?

891
00:32:36,702 --> 00:32:38,602
Come on. One.

892
00:32:38,632 --> 00:32:39,632
I'll hold you.

893
00:32:39,762 --> 00:32:42,702
Here you go. In 3, 2, 1.

894
00:32:42,702 --> 00:32:44,332
(Will Kwang Soo make it?)

895
00:32:44,332 --> 00:32:45,402
He's crawling up.

896
00:32:46,802 --> 00:32:47,962
I can't do it.

897
00:32:48,502 --> 00:32:50,502
(I'll go to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

898
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:51,762
Spread out your arms.

899
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:52,902
Spread them.

900
00:32:52,902 --> 00:32:54,432
(Just reenact the scene.)

901
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:55,462
Your arms.

902
00:32:55,502 --> 00:32:56,602
(Screaming)

903
00:32:57,032 --> 00:32:59,362
- It's all because of you. - Exactly.

904
00:32:59,362 --> 00:33:00,862
- Hey, you should stand up. - Kwang Soo.

905
00:33:00,862 --> 00:33:02,702
I am not joking when I say this.

906
00:33:02,702 --> 00:33:03,702
(Haha finds this too funny.)

907
00:33:03,702 --> 00:33:05,062
I think he's such a coward.

908
00:33:06,002 --> 00:33:08,202
- Let me try. - Okay. Haha, you try it.

909
00:33:08,202 --> 00:33:12,762
In 1, 2, 3. Great!

910
00:33:12,762 --> 00:33:15,702
I am the king of the world.

911
00:33:17,402 --> 00:33:20,862
(This makes me the second in command now.)

912
00:33:21,362 --> 00:33:24,162
(Scaredy-cat Haha succeeds in acting the part.)

913
00:33:26,562 --> 00:33:28,102
All right. I am ready. Let me try.

914
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,702
(Now I am 3rd in command.)

915
00:33:32,702 --> 00:33:33,762
(With the perfect posture, Se Chan succeeds.)

916
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:34,802
- Nice! - Okay.

917
00:33:34,802 --> 00:33:36,602
What was it? Captain, sound the horn.

918
00:33:37,002 --> 00:33:39,102
(He sounds a fanfare for the success.)

919
00:33:40,232 --> 00:33:41,402
Okay, you did it.

920
00:33:41,402 --> 00:33:42,602
- Only Kwang Soo failed. - Kwang Soo.

921
00:33:42,602 --> 00:33:43,902
- Kwang Soo failed. - He failed.

922
00:33:43,902 --> 00:33:45,362
(This determines his rank as the 4th in the group.)

923
00:33:45,462 --> 00:33:47,632
- Hey, Kwang Soo failed. - Great!

924
00:33:48,532 --> 00:33:49,662
(Gosh, this is driving me crazy.)

925
00:33:49,662 --> 00:33:50,832
Do you want to try it again?

926
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,102
- I'll try it again. - We'll hold you. Why can't you try?

927
00:33:53,102 --> 00:33:54,302
- Let me try again. - All right.

928
00:33:54,302 --> 00:33:56,302
(Kwang Soo tries to act the scene once again.)

929
00:33:56,302 --> 00:33:57,432
- Let me try again. - All right.

930
00:33:57,432 --> 00:33:58,962
We are going to hold you.

931
00:33:58,962 --> 00:34:00,432
(They get ready to expose his bottoms.)

932
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:01,432
Jong Kook.

933
00:34:01,662 --> 00:34:03,662
- Do it now. - In 1, 2, 3.

934
00:34:03,662 --> 00:34:04,962
- Get on the banister. - Step on the banister.

935
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:06,032
(I won't fail for the third time.)

936
00:34:06,802 --> 00:34:09,332
I'm sending you to Japan. Book your flight ticket now.

937
00:34:09,332 --> 00:34:10,432
(It's a love story between a man...)

938
00:34:10,432 --> 00:34:12,472
(trying to send Kwang Soo to Japan and a man trying not to leave.)

939
00:34:12,472 --> 00:34:14,862
(This is a miraculous drama that Kwang Soo will show.)

940
00:34:14,862 --> 00:34:17,362
(This is a miraculous drama that Kwang Soo will show.)

941
00:34:17,532 --> 00:34:18,562
Stand up.

942
00:34:20,232 --> 00:34:21,902
- Stand up. You'll be fine. - Stand up.

943
00:34:21,902 --> 00:34:22,932
- Stand up, Kwang Soo. - Get up.

944
00:34:22,932 --> 00:34:24,502
- Stand up. Use your leg muscles. - Stand up.

945
00:34:24,502 --> 00:34:25,662
- Use your leg strength. - In 1, 2...

946
00:34:25,662 --> 00:34:27,562
Use your leg strength.

947
00:34:28,162 --> 00:34:29,562
- In 2, 3. - Go!

948
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:36,532
(Comedians from Korea are funny.)

949
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:39,432
I can't do this. I can't!

950
00:34:39,432 --> 00:34:40,862
- You can't do this? - I can't do this.

951
00:34:41,832 --> 00:34:43,102
- He can't do this. - This is for the show.

952
00:34:43,302 --> 00:34:44,802
Hey, come on.

953
00:34:45,302 --> 00:34:47,002
What are we going to do?

954
00:34:47,262 --> 00:34:49,972
- All right. - We succeeded though!

955
00:34:50,362 --> 00:34:52,102
- Kwang Soo failed. - You are ranked first for the trip.

956
00:34:52,102 --> 00:34:53,402
(Kwang Soo is about to embark on a trip.)

957
00:34:53,402 --> 00:34:55,732
(Will Kwang Soo have a chance to turn the tables around?)

958
00:34:56,002 --> 00:34:59,202
(Team Mongolia must meet nomads and milk the sheep.)

959
00:34:59,202 --> 00:35:02,602
(Team Russia must catch king crabs and 10 different types of seafood.)

960
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:05,662
(If they fail, a trip to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear will be decided.)

961
00:35:05,662 --> 00:35:10,362
(2 members whom the team leaders choose will be exempted.)

962
00:35:10,762 --> 00:35:12,002
I told you to stop!

963
00:35:12,002 --> 00:35:15,802
(This is their last chance. Who will be able to survive?)

964
00:35:16,262 --> 00:35:17,662
Our food must be ready.

965
00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:18,932
- It's coming. - It's coming.

966
00:35:18,932 --> 00:35:20,862
(Team Ji Hyo is waiting for their mysterious dishes.)

967
00:35:20,862 --> 00:35:23,332
(If they finish eating them, the staff will pay half of the bill.)

968
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:24,472
I have a bad feeling about this.

969
00:35:24,472 --> 00:35:25,972
(If they don't finish, they will pay for the whole bill.)

970
00:35:25,972 --> 00:35:27,662
The first dish will be served.

971
00:35:27,802 --> 00:35:29,002
Which number is it?

972
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:31,132
(What is their first menu of their first dinner in Mongolia?)

973
00:35:31,832 --> 00:35:33,032
- This is... - Which number is it?

974
00:35:33,032 --> 00:35:34,432
This is a bowl of lamb noodles.

975
00:35:35,162 --> 00:35:36,562
- Here they are. - What is this one?

976
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,002
This looks interesting.

977
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:40,732
- We... - There's no barbecue dish.

978
00:35:40,732 --> 00:35:41,932
There isn't one?

979
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:45,202
- We ordered a lot of soup. - We ordered flower buns. Great.

980
00:35:45,532 --> 00:35:47,862
- This is driving me crazy. - All of our dishes are brought out.

981
00:35:47,862 --> 00:35:50,472
(What did each member order?)

982
00:35:50,662 --> 00:35:51,972
- All right. - There are only three dishes.

983
00:35:52,302 --> 00:35:54,302
- Who ordered number one? - I did.

984
00:35:54,632 --> 00:35:56,402
Ji Hyo, you ordered number one.

985
00:35:56,402 --> 00:35:59,202
(Number 1 of the menu that Ji Hyo ordered is...)

986
00:35:59,202 --> 00:36:01,602
- You ordered flower buns. - Yes! I ordered flower buns!

987
00:36:01,662 --> 00:36:04,132
- Number five Seok Jin ordered... - Yes.

988
00:36:04,132 --> 00:36:06,802
(Number 5 of the menu that Seok Jin ordered is...)

989
00:36:06,802 --> 00:36:09,002
You ordered fish soup.

990
00:36:09,202 --> 00:36:10,362
This is it.

991
00:36:10,362 --> 00:36:11,862
(Fish soup sounds a bit strange.)

992
00:36:12,832 --> 00:36:14,472
I don't like soup.

993
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,132
(Mongolian spices and oil from the fish are mixed in the soup.)

994
00:36:16,602 --> 00:36:18,162
- And... - Yes?

995
00:36:18,632 --> 00:36:20,972
- The lamb noodles... - Yes.

996
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:22,732
(The lamb noodles hold the key now.)

997
00:36:22,732 --> 00:36:23,802
Which number was this?

998
00:36:23,802 --> 00:36:25,662
(Please don't let it be mine.)

999
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:29,302
(To be honest, I don't think I can eat the lamb noodles.)

1000
00:36:31,402 --> 00:36:34,402
- The lamb noodles. - Which number is it?

1001
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:35,602
It's number six.

1002
00:36:35,602 --> 00:36:36,632
That's yours.

1003
00:36:36,632 --> 00:36:37,732
(You picked it, Jae Seok.)

1004
00:36:37,732 --> 00:36:40,132
Number four on the menu which So Min ordered is water.

1005
00:36:40,472 --> 00:36:41,502
Sorry?

1006
00:36:42,362 --> 00:36:43,472
I ordered water?

1007
00:36:43,972 --> 00:36:46,532
- This is the lamb noodles? - Yes, it is.

1008
00:36:46,532 --> 00:36:47,972
- I have the fish soup. - I have water.

1009
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,202
I'll be better off with water.

1010
00:36:50,362 --> 00:36:52,262
- That's what you two ordered. - Is this fish or sujebi?

1011
00:36:52,332 --> 00:36:53,762
- Let me taste it. - It's not nurungji.

1012
00:36:53,972 --> 00:36:55,802
(Ji Hyo who's the judge of local food, tastes it.)

1013
00:36:55,802 --> 00:36:56,972
Try it.

1014
00:37:00,862 --> 00:37:02,202
- Seok Jin, it's tasty. - Is it?

1015
00:37:02,502 --> 00:37:03,732
This tastes amazing.

1016
00:37:04,162 --> 00:37:06,432
This is really flavorful.

1017
00:37:06,932 --> 00:37:08,232
- It's delicious. - It really is.

1018
00:37:08,232 --> 00:37:09,632
- This tastes like fish jjigae. - I agree.

1019
00:37:09,632 --> 00:37:11,532
- This doesn't taste fishy at all. - It tastes like dried pollack soup.

1020
00:37:11,532 --> 00:37:13,472
- This does taste like that soup. - I got it.

1021
00:37:13,702 --> 00:37:15,232
- This tastes good too. - Seok Jin, you'll like this.

1022
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:17,062
- This is tasty. - This is your sort of food.

1023
00:37:17,062 --> 00:37:18,232
Can we get more plates?

1024
00:37:18,562 --> 00:37:19,732
- Can I try? - You can try that, Seok Jin.

1025
00:37:20,102 --> 00:37:21,102
(He tastes Jae Seok's dish too.)

1026
00:37:24,132 --> 00:37:25,862
Gosh, I don't like this.

1027
00:37:26,002 --> 00:37:27,162
You don't like it?

1028
00:37:27,762 --> 00:37:29,062
This one has a lot of lamb meat though.

1029
00:37:29,062 --> 00:37:31,262
He told us that he really likes lamb.

1030
00:37:31,662 --> 00:37:32,862
That's right.

1031
00:37:32,862 --> 00:37:34,762
- This tastes like lamb. - Well...

1032
00:37:34,762 --> 00:37:37,402
I don't like dishes that has a strong smell of lamb meat.

1033
00:37:37,402 --> 00:37:39,502
- You don't like the smell, right? - Right.

1034
00:37:41,002 --> 00:37:42,432
I miss the burger we had.

1035
00:37:42,432 --> 00:37:44,002
A burger would taste so good.

1036
00:37:44,002 --> 00:37:45,262
I really miss it.

1037
00:37:48,472 --> 00:37:49,662
By the way...

1038
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,062
(He lets out a sigh.)

1039
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,972
- This... - They gave us a big portion.

1040
00:37:55,972 --> 00:37:57,262
This makes me miss home.

1041
00:37:57,262 --> 00:37:59,302
(This makes me miss home.)

1042
00:37:59,302 --> 00:38:02,862
(Honey, I won't complain about the side dishes now.)

1043
00:38:03,402 --> 00:38:04,972
(We recommend this for husbands who complain about food.)

1044
00:38:04,972 --> 00:38:07,802
- People here might enjoy this. - I am not joking.

1045
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:09,562
- I'd eat steamed lamb meat, - As I told you before...

1046
00:38:09,562 --> 00:38:12,932
- but I don't eat lamb soup though. - This has a strong flavor of lamb.

1047
00:38:12,932 --> 00:38:15,662
- The smell... - The smell is really strong.

1048
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,302
By the way, we have to finish eating everything here?

1049
00:38:19,062 --> 00:38:20,102
What are we going to do?

1050
00:38:20,102 --> 00:38:21,472
- I didn't eat a lot. - This feels like a waste.

1051
00:38:21,472 --> 00:38:23,002
(Paying for everything feels like a waste of our money.)

1052
00:38:23,002 --> 00:38:25,062
- Kwon Ryeol likes food. - You should try some.

1053
00:38:26,062 --> 00:38:27,472
But you didn't give me a bite of the burger.

1054
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:28,632
(He was waiting for this moment.)

1055
00:38:28,732 --> 00:38:30,632
(Two hours ago)

1056
00:38:30,632 --> 00:38:31,902
The staff members should try some.

1057
00:38:32,762 --> 00:38:33,932
What should we do?

1058
00:38:34,972 --> 00:38:38,002
(You weren't going to share yours with us?)

1059
00:38:38,002 --> 00:38:39,262
How can you say that while you eat this?

1060
00:38:39,362 --> 00:38:40,562
- But you are giving me this. - Hey, you should try it though.

1061
00:38:40,562 --> 00:38:42,002
- But still. - Right.

1062
00:38:42,002 --> 00:38:43,432
You ought to try different cuisines of the world.

1063
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:45,932
- Have some to taste the dish. - The broth is really rich too.

1064
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:47,132
- Try the soup. - It's not that bad.

1065
00:38:47,132 --> 00:38:48,332
- Taste it. - The soup is really rich.

1066
00:38:50,702 --> 00:38:51,802
How is it?

1067
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:55,972
(He nods his head.)

1068
00:38:55,972 --> 00:38:57,132
Do you like it?

1069
00:38:57,132 --> 00:38:58,632
This tastes like the rich version of ox bone soup.

1070
00:38:59,132 --> 00:39:00,432
- Really? - Do you mean it?

1071
00:39:00,432 --> 00:39:03,402
- Since he likes it, give it to him. - Let him finish everything.

1072
00:39:03,402 --> 00:39:05,302
Do you want to go and have the burger before the restaurant closes?

1073
00:39:05,602 --> 00:39:08,432
(Poor Kwon Ryeol. I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.)

1074
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:10,332
- How do we say, "thank you"? - Thank you.

1075
00:39:10,332 --> 00:39:12,062
- That was "thank you". - No, it wasn't.

1076
00:39:12,062 --> 00:39:13,402
Thank you.

1077
00:39:13,972 --> 00:39:16,232
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1078
00:39:16,232 --> 00:39:17,862
(It's time for them to sleep, but where will they sleep?)

1079
00:39:18,802 --> 00:39:19,832
(The street welcomes the members.)

1080
00:39:19,832 --> 00:39:20,932
Hey, this looks like...

1081
00:39:20,932 --> 00:39:23,302
- Tomorrow morning... - This looks great.

1082
00:39:23,302 --> 00:39:25,002
Now we are in Mongolia for certain.

1083
00:39:25,002 --> 00:39:26,232
This is a department store.

1084
00:39:27,262 --> 00:39:28,602
This is nice.

1085
00:39:29,632 --> 00:39:31,632
- We have to look for lodgings. - That's right.

1086
00:39:32,632 --> 00:39:35,162
- Where can we find hotels? - Where are the hotels?

1087
00:39:35,402 --> 00:39:36,632
Where can we find hotels?

1088
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:39,362
We have to find the hotels.

1089
00:39:39,362 --> 00:39:40,402
(While middle-aged men are lost..)

1090
00:39:40,432 --> 00:39:41,562
What are you searching online?

1091
00:39:42,002 --> 00:39:44,232
Hotels. She's looking up hotels online.

1092
00:39:44,232 --> 00:39:45,602
- Online? - Yes.

1093
00:39:45,602 --> 00:39:47,632
We are looking for a hotel nearby using the map.

1094
00:39:48,802 --> 00:39:50,432
Gosh, this is it. I found one.

1095
00:39:50,862 --> 00:39:53,362
This is where we are now.

1096
00:39:53,732 --> 00:39:55,972
- If we go farther, there's a hotel. - Let's go then.

1097
00:39:56,232 --> 00:39:57,502
We have to go this way?

1098
00:39:58,002 --> 00:40:00,602
- It says to go straight for 500m. - This way?

1099
00:40:00,602 --> 00:40:02,062
I want some soup.

1100
00:40:02,262 --> 00:40:04,302
- What? - I want to have some soup.

1101
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:05,472
- Don't you? - I do.

1102
00:40:05,472 --> 00:40:06,932
- We should have some ramyeon. - We ought to.

1103
00:40:06,932 --> 00:40:08,802
We will look so bloated tomorrow morning.

1104
00:40:08,802 --> 00:40:11,762
What is this? Isn't this a hotel?

1105
00:40:11,972 --> 00:40:14,132
- There is one. - This is a hotel.

1106
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,302
- Let me go and ask the rate. - I hope it's cheap and reasonable.

1107
00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:19,702
- Should I go with him? - All of us shouldn't go in.

1108
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:22,132
So Min, come here. Don't make things harder than they are.

1109
00:40:22,302 --> 00:40:23,332
Yes.

1110
00:40:24,202 --> 00:40:25,562
(Darn it.)

1111
00:40:25,902 --> 00:40:27,232
- Hey. - What?

1112
00:40:27,762 --> 00:40:30,432
- For a room, it's 200 dollars. - What?

1113
00:40:30,432 --> 00:40:33,002
If we book two rooms, it will be about 440 dollars.

1114
00:40:33,702 --> 00:40:35,502
- We can't stay here. - Could we lower the rate?

1115
00:40:35,502 --> 00:40:37,202
If we join their membership, they will give us a 20 percent discount.

1116
00:40:37,732 --> 00:40:38,802
What are you talking about?

1117
00:40:38,802 --> 00:40:40,532
(Seok Jin is quite well-informed.)

1118
00:40:40,532 --> 00:40:41,632
If we join...

1119
00:40:41,932 --> 00:40:45,002
- Or we can... - When will we milk the sheep?

1120
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,932
It's been a while since we arrived.

1121
00:40:48,632 --> 00:40:51,562
- We don't even have a hotel. - Exactly.

1122
00:40:51,662 --> 00:40:54,472
- We haven't done... - We might end up on the street.

1123
00:40:54,472 --> 00:40:55,732
Let's go to another hotel.

1124
00:40:56,002 --> 00:40:57,202
- Let's go. - To another hotel.

1125
00:40:57,232 --> 00:40:58,662
- Let's keep going up. - Jae Seok...

1126
00:40:58,662 --> 00:40:59,862
It's so expensive.

1127
00:40:59,862 --> 00:41:01,262
That one looks expensive too.

1128
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:03,632
There aren't that many people on the street here now.

1129
00:41:03,632 --> 00:41:04,702
That hotel is big too.

1130
00:41:05,002 --> 00:41:07,332
- Besides, - Even Mongolian locals went home.

1131
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:09,102
I'm getting tired now.

1132
00:41:10,432 --> 00:41:12,002
- There's a hotel. - Where?

1133
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,102
That one. Doesn't it say, "Premium Hotel"?

1134
00:41:14,732 --> 00:41:15,862
(They find a hotel after walking for 20 minutes.)

1135
00:41:15,862 --> 00:41:17,362
- Where is it? - There. It's across the street.

1136
00:41:18,702 --> 00:41:20,062
The rate might be reasonable, right?

1137
00:41:20,602 --> 00:41:21,832
- Let's go in. - Let's go inside.

1138
00:41:21,832 --> 00:41:24,032
- I'll go talk to them. - Make it happen.

1139
00:41:24,032 --> 00:41:25,502
I will come back with good news.

1140
00:41:25,502 --> 00:41:26,632
- Okay. - You can do it!

1141
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:28,902
(Seok Jin is playing an active role today as a negotiator.)

1142
00:41:28,972 --> 00:41:30,862
- Two rooms? - Are there two vacant rooms?

1143
00:41:30,932 --> 00:41:32,972
What is the rate for one room per night?

1144
00:41:32,972 --> 00:41:36,362
For one room, the rate is 100 dollars per night.

1145
00:41:36,762 --> 00:41:38,402
- 100 dollars? - Yes.

1146
00:41:39,232 --> 00:41:40,502
Could you give me a discount?

1147
00:41:40,662 --> 00:41:42,562
- Discount? - Yes, please.

1148
00:41:43,062 --> 00:41:44,232
We are like brothers.

1149
00:41:44,932 --> 00:41:46,472
How much will it be for two rooms?

1150
00:41:46,472 --> 00:41:49,802
(Will Seok Jin be able to bargain for the rooms?)

1151
00:41:50,532 --> 00:41:52,262
(Nervous)

1152
00:41:52,262 --> 00:41:55,562
When we landed at the airport in Mongolia...

1153
00:41:56,002 --> 00:41:57,232
(We had a great start.)

1154
00:41:57,232 --> 00:41:58,862
I had a good feeling about the trip.

1155
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:00,902
At night, I feel a bit lonely.

1156
00:42:01,162 --> 00:42:03,902
- I'm lonely too. - I don't know where we are.

1157
00:42:04,472 --> 00:42:05,602
Hey!

1158
00:42:05,862 --> 00:42:07,032
Let's go in. This hotel is nice.

1159
00:42:07,032 --> 00:42:08,062
- How much is it? - How much?

1160
00:42:08,062 --> 00:42:10,832
With the discount, for two rooms,

1161
00:42:11,032 --> 00:42:13,262
- How much was it? - it's 160 dollars.

1162
00:42:13,902 --> 00:42:16,232
- That's really reasonable. - For 2 rooms, it's 160 dollars.

1163
00:42:16,332 --> 00:42:17,432
- Gosh, it's cheap. - That's a good price.

1164
00:42:17,432 --> 00:42:19,762
Breakfast, wireless internet, and taxes are included in the price.

1165
00:42:20,132 --> 00:42:22,162
- They provide breakfast too? - Yes.

1166
00:42:22,162 --> 00:42:24,502
- Seok Jin, this is great. - I think...

1167
00:42:24,502 --> 00:42:26,062
Let's go in. This is nice.

1168
00:42:26,332 --> 00:42:28,662
- This looks clean. - Exactly. It looks nice.

1169
00:42:29,102 --> 00:42:30,472
This hotel is nice.

1170
00:42:30,862 --> 00:42:33,202
- Goodness. - This is great.

1171
00:42:33,732 --> 00:42:36,162
- This room is excellent. - It is indeed.

1172
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,762
This is a good room given it cost us 90 dollars.

1173
00:42:37,762 --> 00:42:39,332
- This only cost us 90 dollars? - Yes.

1174
00:42:39,332 --> 00:42:40,362
This is amazing.

1175
00:42:40,362 --> 00:42:43,262
- This is so nice. - This is really good.

1176
00:42:44,032 --> 00:42:45,932
This is nice, but Ji Hyo, I found something interesting.

1177
00:42:45,932 --> 00:42:48,472
- The bed is really high. - You're right. Isn't that too high?

1178
00:42:48,472 --> 00:42:49,632
Why is it so high?

1179
00:42:49,632 --> 00:42:50,802
I have to jump to get on the bed.

1180
00:42:50,972 --> 00:42:53,562
If we fall, we might get injured.

1181
00:42:53,632 --> 00:42:57,602
If Haha were here, he probably had to jump high.

1182
00:42:57,932 --> 00:42:59,932
Shall we eat now?

1183
00:42:59,932 --> 00:43:01,032
Do you want to eat now?

1184
00:43:01,032 --> 00:43:03,132
- Shall we eat now? - What did you bring?

1185
00:43:03,132 --> 00:43:04,232
Let me show you.

1186
00:43:04,232 --> 00:43:05,402
(So Min opens her enormous luggage.)

1187
00:43:06,402 --> 00:43:08,602
- There are cup noodles. - That looks delicious.

1188
00:43:08,602 --> 00:43:10,102
I am going to eat jjajangmyeon.

1189
00:43:10,602 --> 00:43:11,632
There is more.

1190
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,302
You are incredible.

1191
00:43:14,932 --> 00:43:16,232
She brought a parka.

1192
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:20,402
She might need a parka...

1193
00:43:20,402 --> 00:43:22,532
- when the weather turns cold. - I can't believe you.

1194
00:43:22,532 --> 00:43:23,932
- Are you climbing Annapurna Massif? - That's hilarious.

1195
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:27,602
So Min, don't you think this is too much?

1196
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,362
I thought it might be cold.

1197
00:43:29,662 --> 00:43:30,662
So Min.

1198
00:43:30,972 --> 00:43:32,332
This is too much.

1199
00:43:32,332 --> 00:43:33,732
I didn't know it would be so warm in Mongolia.

1200
00:43:33,732 --> 00:43:36,102
- Why did they scare us so much? - I thought it might be cold.

1201
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:40,262
- Okay. I will wash up first. - Go ahead.

1202
00:43:40,432 --> 00:43:41,902
How refreshing.

1203
00:43:41,902 --> 00:43:43,162
(It's bedtime for the friends of 20 years.)

1204
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,832
- Did you finish washing up? - Of course.

1205
00:43:45,502 --> 00:43:47,262
Look at this bed.

1206
00:43:48,402 --> 00:43:49,662
(The high bed makes Jae Seok feel playful.)

1207
00:43:49,662 --> 00:43:52,032
I have to climb into the bed.

1208
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:54,462
Why do I need to hike up here?

1209
00:43:54,462 --> 00:43:55,832
I will die if I fall off.

1210
00:43:56,762 --> 00:43:59,102
It's very high. You can't climb into it easily.

1211
00:43:59,732 --> 00:44:04,032
(I am Yu Jae Seok, the healthy man.)

1212
00:44:08,632 --> 00:44:10,132
(Jumping)

1213
00:44:10,132 --> 00:44:12,262
- You should jump in one go. - Try it.

1214
00:44:13,262 --> 00:44:15,162
(I will show you.)

1215
00:44:15,162 --> 00:44:16,202
(Bumping)

1216
00:44:17,932 --> 00:44:19,132
(He embarrasses himself.)

1217
00:44:19,132 --> 00:44:20,802
The mattress got pushed back.

1218
00:44:20,802 --> 00:44:21,932
Give up.

1219
00:44:22,232 --> 00:44:26,862
(This man in his 50s has a pajama party.)

1220
00:44:28,462 --> 00:44:29,602
(He can't control his good cheer.)

1221
00:44:29,602 --> 00:44:32,762
For goodness' sake. This bed is weak.

1222
00:44:34,602 --> 00:44:38,902
(The two comedians film an action movie at night.)

1223
00:44:39,732 --> 00:44:41,202
It's over there.

1224
00:44:41,202 --> 00:44:43,602
(The two elegant actresses...)

1225
00:44:43,602 --> 00:44:46,202
(are cleaning up the room for a good night's sleep.)

1226
00:44:46,202 --> 00:44:48,062
My goodness.

1227
00:44:48,362 --> 00:44:50,402
Are you okay?

1228
00:44:50,402 --> 00:44:53,232
- My goodness. - It hurts so much.

1229
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,462
- My goodness. - It hurts so much.

1230
00:44:56,462 --> 00:44:58,762
Ji Hyo, I didn't crack my skull, did I?

1231
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,562
Your head made such a clear sound.

1232
00:45:02,002 --> 00:45:03,202
(They burst out laughing.)

1233
00:45:03,202 --> 00:45:06,132
- My goodness. - That was hilarious.

1234
00:45:06,232 --> 00:45:07,832
Your head made a loud sound.

1235
00:45:08,032 --> 00:45:09,502
It was loud, right?

1236
00:45:09,502 --> 00:45:12,262
It was a very clear sound.

1237
00:45:12,732 --> 00:45:14,902
So Min is hilarious.

1238
00:45:14,902 --> 00:45:15,962
(So Min is so cute.)

1239
00:45:16,602 --> 00:45:19,162
- Let's go to bed, So Min. - Goodnight.

1240
00:45:19,262 --> 00:45:22,602
If you are hot, remove the duvet. If you are cold,

1241
00:45:23,202 --> 00:45:26,302
you can wear these socks.

1242
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:28,432
Goodnight.

1243
00:45:28,432 --> 00:45:32,402
(So Min puts on a sheet mask in the dark not to disturb Ji Hyo.)

1244
00:45:32,402 --> 00:45:36,632
(Ji Hyo lights the room with her cell phone for So Min.)

1245
00:45:36,632 --> 00:45:37,902
(So Min, you are...)

1246
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:39,262
You are very bright.

1247
00:45:39,562 --> 00:45:41,702
You are optimistic.

1248
00:45:42,002 --> 00:45:45,432
I am very pessimistic.

1249
00:45:46,232 --> 00:45:47,902
My goodness.

1250
00:45:48,632 --> 00:45:54,902
(They have a conversation in the time of their own.)

1251
00:45:56,432 --> 00:46:02,202
(It's not a night of 2 actresses, but 2 sisters.)

1252
00:46:02,202 --> 00:46:04,532
I am experiencing...

1253
00:46:04,732 --> 00:46:08,732
a new kind of work in a new kind of environment.

1254
00:46:10,532 --> 00:46:13,802
It's something I haven't tried before.

1255
00:46:13,802 --> 00:46:15,262
That's right.

1256
00:46:16,102 --> 00:46:21,202
(The youngest member reveal her heart to Ji Hyo.)

1257
00:46:21,932 --> 00:46:23,132
Come here.

1258
00:46:23,502 --> 00:46:27,002
(The night that is filled with fatigue and laughter deepens.)

1259
00:46:28,232 --> 00:46:30,902
(The day of the mission rises.)

1260
00:46:30,902 --> 00:46:33,462
(They must meet a Borjigit today.)

1261
00:46:33,462 --> 00:46:36,932
In this nice weather, you will leave to find the nomads.

1262
00:46:36,932 --> 00:46:38,832
Here is the important thing.

1263
00:46:38,932 --> 00:46:42,502
When you go to your friend's house...

1264
00:46:42,662 --> 00:46:46,762
for the first time, you bring a gift.

1265
00:46:46,862 --> 00:46:49,062
- There is a traditional market. - A traditional market sounds fun.

1266
00:46:49,362 --> 00:46:51,762
A traditional market sounds fun.

1267
00:46:51,862 --> 00:46:53,202
Let's hit the road.

1268
00:46:53,202 --> 00:46:55,062
- We must complete the mission. - A traditional market sounds fun.

1269
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,302
- Let's go. - The sunlight is strong.

1270
00:46:57,302 --> 00:46:59,262
(They hurry up and leave for the market.)

1271
00:46:59,362 --> 00:47:00,362
It's that way.

1272
00:47:00,362 --> 00:47:03,462
- It's so big. - Where is the entrance?

1273
00:47:03,462 --> 00:47:05,732
(They arrive at Naran Tuul Market.)

1274
00:47:05,732 --> 00:47:09,602
It's the traditional market of Mongolia.

1275
00:47:09,602 --> 00:47:12,962
It's similar to the one in Korea.

1276
00:47:12,962 --> 00:47:14,202
- It really is. - Right?

1277
00:47:14,202 --> 00:47:16,062
- There are fruits. - They use the same parasols.

1278
00:47:16,902 --> 00:47:19,302
Seok Jin, it will take too long...

1279
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:22,662
if we move in one group. Let's split up...

1280
00:47:22,662 --> 00:47:24,002
- into groups of two. - That's a good idea.

1281
00:47:24,002 --> 00:47:26,832
It hurts my feelings that you want to split up.

1282
00:47:26,832 --> 00:47:29,132
- Give me some money. - Let's buy two beverages.

1283
00:47:29,332 --> 00:47:30,502
The aftertaste is that of jujube.

1284
00:47:30,502 --> 00:47:31,902
I stepped on gum.

1285
00:47:31,902 --> 00:47:33,832
(I stepped on gum.)

1286
00:47:34,502 --> 00:47:36,362
- Gum? - My goodness.

1287
00:47:36,362 --> 00:47:38,132
- She requires a lot of care. - She requires a lot of care.

1288
00:47:38,132 --> 00:47:41,402
(The gum stretches.)

1289
00:47:41,402 --> 00:47:43,132
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

1290
00:47:44,502 --> 00:47:47,102
I was surprised when I felt a tug on my foot.

1291
00:47:47,432 --> 00:47:49,102
Thank goodness you didn't step on poop.

1292
00:47:49,702 --> 00:47:52,202
(A few hours later)

1293
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:55,102
(Ji Hyo's team steps on poop.)

1294
00:47:55,102 --> 00:47:58,332
(What will become of their journey to find a Borjigit?)

1295
00:47:58,332 --> 00:47:59,762
- My goodness. - Let's go.

1296
00:48:00,032 --> 00:48:01,302
- Ji Hyo. - Yes?

1297
00:48:01,302 --> 00:48:03,262
- I will see you later. - See you later.

1298
00:48:03,702 --> 00:48:05,362
I can't believe I am stuck with Seok Jin.

1299
00:48:05,362 --> 00:48:06,602
- Come here. - What should we do?

1300
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:09,002
They are nomads...

1301
00:48:09,232 --> 00:48:10,932
who live on the grassland.

1302
00:48:10,932 --> 00:48:12,962
We should buy something that is useful for the nomads.

1303
00:48:13,262 --> 00:48:15,802
- An umbrella would be nice. - That would be cute.

1304
00:48:15,932 --> 00:48:19,762
Toys. I heard industrial products are valuable here.

1305
00:48:20,002 --> 00:48:22,562
Let's keep going. Doesn't it feel like...

1306
00:48:22,562 --> 00:48:25,232
- a five-day market in Korea? - You are right.

1307
00:48:25,232 --> 00:48:27,762
It's the same as the market in Korea.

1308
00:48:28,032 --> 00:48:30,162
- There are a lot of hats. - There are a lot of hats.

1309
00:48:30,862 --> 00:48:33,462
- This is fun, So Min. - Look at the towels.

1310
00:48:33,462 --> 00:48:34,902
Aren't they cute?

1311
00:48:36,232 --> 00:48:37,232
What?

1312
00:48:38,202 --> 00:48:40,932
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

1313
00:48:40,932 --> 00:48:44,002
(They find Kwang Soo in Mongolia.)

1314
00:48:44,002 --> 00:48:47,302
(Kwang Soo in Mongolia)

1315
00:48:48,032 --> 00:48:51,362
Kwang Soo, you shouldn't be here. You should go and catch king crab.

1316
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:55,532
The mannequin has big eyes.

1317
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:58,402
(Worry about your own mission. I am doing well.)

1318
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:01,632
- Kwang Soo is here. - He is in Mongolia.

1319
00:49:02,432 --> 00:49:04,002
Shall we take a picture with it?

1320
00:49:04,302 --> 00:49:05,962
In 1, 2, 3.

1321
00:49:07,162 --> 00:49:10,362
(Shouldn't you go and catch king crab?)

1322
00:49:13,432 --> 00:49:15,102
This must be the traditional costume.

1323
00:49:15,102 --> 00:49:17,802
It's probably expensive, right?

1324
00:49:17,802 --> 00:49:19,562
- It looks expensive. - It's pretty.

1325
00:49:19,562 --> 00:49:20,862
It's very pretty.

1326
00:49:21,002 --> 00:49:23,162
The fabric is thick. Wait, it's not that thick.

1327
00:49:23,402 --> 00:49:24,802
It's pretty.

1328
00:49:24,802 --> 00:49:27,302
Which one do you like? You will look cute in this one.

1329
00:49:27,302 --> 00:49:29,762
- It's pretty. - Pick the one with two colors.

1330
00:49:29,762 --> 00:49:31,902
You should try on the blue one or this one.

1331
00:49:32,962 --> 00:49:34,462
(Ji Hyo holds the bag for So Min.)

1332
00:49:34,462 --> 00:49:36,832
- Thank you. - It's pretty on the inside too.

1333
00:49:36,832 --> 00:49:38,162
(So Min tries it on.)

1334
00:49:38,162 --> 00:49:39,532
It's cool.

1335
00:49:40,462 --> 00:49:43,862
(The familiar sight makes her sing the background music.)

1336
00:49:44,462 --> 00:49:46,162
Chun-Li.

1337
00:49:46,162 --> 00:49:47,332
You look cute.

1338
00:49:47,332 --> 00:49:50,132
(Wearing deel makes her look like Chun-Li from Mongolia.)

1339
00:49:50,132 --> 00:49:52,402
How cute! You should buy it.

1340
00:49:53,262 --> 00:49:54,832
How much is this?

1341
00:49:55,062 --> 00:49:56,332
It's 95,000 tughrik.

1342
00:49:56,332 --> 00:49:59,702
That means it's about 40 dollars.

1343
00:49:59,862 --> 00:50:01,662
Jae Seok and Seok Jin will scold us...

1344
00:50:01,662 --> 00:50:04,132
- if we buy these, right? - They will say we wasted money.

1345
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:06,562
(While they are 100 percent sure they will get scolded,)

1346
00:50:06,562 --> 00:50:09,832
(Ji Hyo tries on deel since it's pretty.)

1347
00:50:09,832 --> 00:50:11,402
Why do I look like a man?

1348
00:50:12,162 --> 00:50:14,062
Don't I look like a man?

1349
00:50:14,062 --> 00:50:17,332
(She looks like a mischievous boy who kicks a ball on the grassland.)

1350
00:50:18,662 --> 00:50:22,332
(The fashion nomads, Ji Hyo and So Min, are here.)

1351
00:50:22,332 --> 00:50:24,962
(The gallant man and the cute Chun-Li)

1352
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:28,902
(Instead of milking sheep, they try on clothes.)

1353
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:33,432
(The immature Ji Hyo and So Min have a fashion show.)

1354
00:50:35,962 --> 00:50:38,362
(They cost 95 dollars in total.)

1355
00:50:38,362 --> 00:50:40,562
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin will scold us if we buy these, right?)

1356
00:50:40,562 --> 00:50:42,962
Jae Seok and Seok Jin will scold us if we buy these, right?

1357
00:50:44,162 --> 00:50:47,262
- I look good in these sunglasses. - I look amazing in them.

1358
00:50:47,262 --> 00:50:48,402
Don't they look good on me?

1359
00:50:48,402 --> 00:50:50,132
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin are even more immature.)

1360
00:50:50,802 --> 00:50:53,602
(They have been spending 30 minutes on sunglasses.)

1361
00:50:53,602 --> 00:50:55,832
- Don't they look good on me? - They look good on me.

1362
00:50:56,232 --> 00:51:00,132
(Is he the Mongolian version of Son Ji Chang?)

1363
00:51:00,132 --> 00:51:01,462
You should buy them.

1364
00:51:02,902 --> 00:51:04,402
(They are perfect for your face.)

1365
00:51:04,662 --> 00:51:05,832
They are perfect.

1366
00:51:05,832 --> 00:51:08,702
- People are laughing at me. - You should buy them.

1367
00:51:09,002 --> 00:51:10,802
Even the owner laughed at me. Do you think I should buy them?

1368
00:51:11,062 --> 00:51:13,262
(They are perfect for you.)

1369
00:51:13,602 --> 00:51:16,162
Look at this. These sunglasses go up when I smile.

1370
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:18,062
(Going up)

1371
00:51:19,032 --> 00:51:22,002
(His facial muscles are an elevator.)

1372
00:51:22,932 --> 00:51:24,162
(That customer is funny too.)

1373
00:51:24,162 --> 00:51:26,432
(The owner bursts out laughing for the 2nd time.)

1374
00:51:26,862 --> 00:51:29,962
You came here to buy presents for the nomads.

1375
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,702
- You are right. - We can give them sunglasses.

1376
00:51:31,702 --> 00:51:34,302
- We can give them sunglasses. - We can give them sunglasses.

1377
00:51:34,302 --> 00:51:37,602
Please ask her if the nomads wear sunglasses.

1378
00:51:38,162 --> 00:51:41,662
The nomads wear sunglasses. They wear them often.

1379
00:51:41,662 --> 00:51:43,902
- Do they wear them often? - Of course they do.

1380
00:51:43,902 --> 00:51:46,162
We will buy a pair of sunglasses.

1381
00:51:46,162 --> 00:51:47,832
Let's buy a pair of sunglasses.

1382
00:51:47,832 --> 00:51:49,062
(After a fashion show, they buy a pair of sunglasses as a present.)

1383
00:51:49,332 --> 00:51:50,702
This is a market too.

1384
00:51:51,362 --> 00:51:52,862
- This is a market too. - Yes.

1385
00:51:53,162 --> 00:51:55,862
We will find more products here.

1386
00:51:56,432 --> 00:51:57,732
- I smell cheese. - I smell cheese.

1387
00:51:58,032 --> 00:51:59,632
- I smell cheese. - There is cheese.

1388
00:51:59,632 --> 00:52:01,132
I think they sell meat too.

1389
00:52:01,132 --> 00:52:03,332
(There are dairy products from sheep and cows.)

1390
00:52:03,332 --> 00:52:04,702
What is this?

1391
00:52:05,502 --> 00:52:07,632
- What is this? - It's aaruul.

1392
00:52:07,632 --> 00:52:09,662
- What is it? - It's hard yogurt you can chew on.

1393
00:52:09,662 --> 00:52:11,702
(Aaruul is dried dairy product from the nomads.)

1394
00:52:11,702 --> 00:52:13,902
- May I try one? - How much is it for one?

1395
00:52:14,762 --> 00:52:16,762
(They take a bite.)

1396
00:52:17,632 --> 00:52:20,732
(My goodness, it's the taste...)

1397
00:52:20,732 --> 00:52:23,762
(of the grassland.)

1398
00:52:24,062 --> 00:52:25,962
(Wait a minute.)

1399
00:52:25,962 --> 00:52:28,502
(This is...)

1400
00:52:29,002 --> 00:52:30,062
This is a bit...

1401
00:52:30,062 --> 00:52:33,202
(It's too different for us.)

1402
00:52:33,202 --> 00:52:35,462
- Aaruul is... - It's not for us.

1403
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:38,662
(After their shocking encounter with aaruul,)

1404
00:52:38,662 --> 00:52:43,062
(they see it again as a welcome food from the nomads.)

1405
00:52:43,062 --> 00:52:47,302
(Will they eat aaruul from the Borjigit?)

1406
00:52:47,502 --> 00:52:48,632
(It's a snack shop.)

1407
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:51,032
- Hello. - Hello.

1408
00:52:51,202 --> 00:52:52,962
These are very pretty.

1409
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:54,062
Look at this.

1410
00:52:54,062 --> 00:52:56,562
Ma'am, please give us 2kg.

1411
00:52:56,562 --> 00:52:57,702
Candies and these.

1412
00:52:58,202 --> 00:53:00,832
These look like toys. Kids must love them.

1413
00:53:01,632 --> 00:53:03,162
Let's take some of those too.

1414
00:53:04,002 --> 00:53:06,332
We'll have 2kg of the candies and these.

1415
00:53:06,832 --> 00:53:08,732
They look tasty.

1416
00:53:09,762 --> 00:53:11,632
Excuse me.

1417
00:53:12,732 --> 00:53:16,162
Is your last name Borjigit.

1418
00:53:17,662 --> 00:53:20,302
Is your last name Borjigit?

1419
00:53:20,302 --> 00:53:23,262
(She could have a nomad relative if she's Borjigit.)

1420
00:53:23,332 --> 00:53:24,462
(But she has a different last name.)

1421
00:53:24,502 --> 00:53:27,802
Is there anyone with the last name, Borjigit, around here?

1422
00:53:28,132 --> 00:53:30,202
I'm not sure about it.

1423
00:53:31,032 --> 00:53:33,732
(People with that last name are hard to find even in the city.)

1424
00:53:33,732 --> 00:53:38,002
We have to find a nomad whose last name is Borjigit.

1425
00:53:38,002 --> 00:53:39,332
(Will they be able to find them?)

1426
00:53:40,132 --> 00:53:41,602
- We bought a lot. - Where are the kids?

1427
00:53:41,602 --> 00:53:42,732
I wish we could meet them.

1428
00:53:42,732 --> 00:53:45,002
We should. Let's go that way.

1429
00:53:45,002 --> 00:53:46,132
(Where are the two female members?)

1430
00:53:46,302 --> 00:53:48,002
(Laughing)

1431
00:53:49,802 --> 00:53:52,532
The sisters are so cute.

1432
00:53:53,662 --> 00:53:55,302
The price was reasonable, right?

1433
00:53:55,302 --> 00:53:56,302
Right.

1434
00:53:56,732 --> 00:53:57,932
We won't get burnt now.

1435
00:53:57,932 --> 00:53:58,932
Right?

1436
00:53:59,132 --> 00:54:01,802
I guess I'll take off my T-shirt and wear this.

1437
00:54:02,132 --> 00:54:03,332
(Linking arms)

1438
00:54:03,332 --> 00:54:04,432
Getting out of hands.

1439
00:54:05,932 --> 00:54:08,702
Let's go. It's Jae Seok.

1440
00:54:09,462 --> 00:54:13,202
(They find Seok Jin and Jae Seok walking ahead of them.)

1441
00:54:13,202 --> 00:54:14,432
(They walk on without knowing.)

1442
00:54:14,432 --> 00:54:16,232
- Careful. - Gosh.

1443
00:54:16,432 --> 00:54:17,962
Let's surprise them from behind.

1444
00:54:19,332 --> 00:54:22,162
(They're immersed in window shopping.)

1445
00:54:23,332 --> 00:54:25,302
- My gosh! - Goodness!

1446
00:54:25,932 --> 00:54:27,262
(It's so fun to startle the middle-aged men.)

1447
00:54:27,262 --> 00:54:28,732
- You startled me. - You startled me. Gosh.

1448
00:54:30,032 --> 00:54:31,132
- You startled me. - Did you buy those clothes?

1449
00:54:31,132 --> 00:54:32,502
- Yes. - It's matching clothes.

1450
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:35,102
We bought some gifts.

1451
00:54:35,102 --> 00:54:36,402
We bought candies for them.

1452
00:54:36,402 --> 00:54:39,732
- Great. You guys bought snacks... - These too.

1453
00:54:39,732 --> 00:54:41,232
and we bought daily items.

1454
00:54:41,232 --> 00:54:43,032
- Right. - That's great.

1455
00:54:43,032 --> 00:54:44,562
Let's head out then.

1456
00:54:44,562 --> 00:54:45,932
- Okay. - Good.

1457
00:54:45,932 --> 00:54:47,002
(They finish buying gifts for the nomads.)

1458
00:54:47,762 --> 00:54:49,732
There are restaurants 20 minutes away from here.

1459
00:54:49,732 --> 00:54:51,432
- Let's go. - Let's head there.

1460
00:54:51,632 --> 00:54:52,632
I'm hungry.

1461
00:54:52,632 --> 00:54:54,732
- I'm spotting food now. - I see restaurants.

1462
00:54:54,732 --> 00:54:56,462
- Great. - I see restaurants now.

1463
00:54:56,462 --> 00:54:58,462
Let's pick one and go in.

1464
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:01,362
- There are lamb drawings. - "Mongolian food"?

1465
00:55:01,802 --> 00:55:02,832
Yes.

1466
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:05,332
(They run into a stranger with the traditional clothes on.)

1467
00:55:05,332 --> 00:55:07,102
- Excuse me. - Borjigit?

1468
00:55:07,102 --> 00:55:09,362
- Right. - Please ask him.

1469
00:55:09,562 --> 00:55:11,462
What is your last name?

1470
00:55:11,462 --> 00:55:13,132
It's Khalkha.

1471
00:55:13,132 --> 00:55:15,132
Where can we meet Borjigit people?

1472
00:55:15,132 --> 00:55:19,202
We're looking for a nomad whose last name is Borjigit.

1473
00:55:19,202 --> 00:55:20,262
Where should we go?

1474
00:55:20,702 --> 00:55:26,002
There aren't many with that last name. You need to search carefully.

1475
00:55:26,002 --> 00:55:28,902
(Will this stranger be their savior?)

1476
00:55:29,948 --> 00:55:30,988
What?

1477
00:55:30,988 --> 00:55:33,918
(20 percent of Mongolians are Borjigit, but there seems to be 0.)

1478
00:55:33,918 --> 00:55:36,018
(If they fail to find one, they won't get to complete the mission.)

1479
00:55:36,748 --> 00:55:39,348
(Everyone said it's hard, but they won't give up.)

1480
00:55:39,348 --> 00:55:42,448
(They only have half a day left. How will the things turn out?)

1481
00:55:44,088 --> 00:55:45,118
What is that?

1482
00:55:46,148 --> 00:55:47,288
- Is this a restaurant? - What is this?

1483
00:55:47,288 --> 00:55:48,288
- What is this? - A restaurant?

1484
00:55:48,288 --> 00:55:49,718
- It must be a restaurant. - It is.

1485
00:55:50,048 --> 00:55:51,818
- It says "gimbap". - It's a Korean restaurant.

1486
00:55:51,818 --> 00:55:54,118
- What is that? - They sell Korean food.

1487
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:55,988
"Jeyuk bokkeum, gimbap".

1488
00:55:56,018 --> 00:55:58,688
(They find a menu written in Korean.)

1489
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,518
- They also serve Mongolian food. - They sell both.

1490
00:56:00,518 --> 00:56:02,818
- Shall we go in here? - They serve both kinds.

1491
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:05,688
Let's go in and order what each of us want...

1492
00:56:05,688 --> 00:56:08,418
since they serve both kinds.

1493
00:56:09,118 --> 00:56:10,118
Let's go in.

1494
00:56:10,118 --> 00:56:12,448
(They enter the fusion Mongolian restaurant.)

1495
00:56:12,448 --> 00:56:14,318
- Two orders of kimchi jjigae. - Jeyuk bokkeum too.

1496
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:15,888
- Are you having jeyuk bokkeum? - Okay.

1497
00:56:15,888 --> 00:56:19,948
We must remember that we're not here for travel.

1498
00:56:19,948 --> 00:56:21,488
I need to get to work.

1499
00:56:21,718 --> 00:56:23,788
- Work on what? - You know,

1500
00:56:23,788 --> 00:56:27,418
Chan Hyuk is from Mongolia.

1501
00:56:27,418 --> 00:56:28,688
He once lived in Mongolia.

1502
00:56:28,688 --> 00:56:29,888
(Maybe he has a Borjigit friend?)

1503
00:56:29,888 --> 00:56:31,288
Akdong Musician.

1504
00:56:31,618 --> 00:56:35,048
(Akdong Musician is the acoustic duo from Mongolia.)

1505
00:56:36,718 --> 00:56:41,118
We've been living in Mongolia for two years with our parents.

1506
00:56:42,118 --> 00:56:45,818
I didn't know what would happen, so I got his number beforehand.

1507
00:56:45,818 --> 00:56:47,718
- I see. - That's a great idea.

1508
00:56:47,718 --> 00:56:48,718
That's amazing.

1509
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,218
I've never tried calling him before though.

1510
00:56:51,218 --> 00:56:52,348
I see.

1511
00:56:52,348 --> 00:56:53,618
He might not answer it then.

1512
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:56,048
(Their last hope is Chan Hyuk.)

1513
00:56:56,048 --> 00:57:00,148
(Chan Hyuk, do you know Borjigit by any chance?)

1514
00:57:00,148 --> 00:57:01,618
- Hello? - Chan Hyuk!

1515
00:57:02,518 --> 00:57:05,788
Who is this?

1516
00:57:05,788 --> 00:57:07,418
(Hi, I'm the national host, Yu Jae Seok.)

1517
00:57:07,418 --> 00:57:10,688
It's Jae Seok. Hello?

1518
00:57:12,948 --> 00:57:13,948
- Hey. - Hello.

1519
00:57:13,948 --> 00:57:16,648
Were you surprised? Chan Hyuk.

1520
00:57:16,648 --> 00:57:19,618
- He's not even close to him. - I visited Mongolia.

1521
00:57:19,618 --> 00:57:22,088
- Oh, because of Running Man? - Yes.

1522
00:57:22,088 --> 00:57:23,518
- Hello. - Hello.

1523
00:57:23,518 --> 00:57:25,148
Hello.

1524
00:57:25,148 --> 00:57:27,888
Did you live in Ulaanbaatar by any chance?

1525
00:57:28,918 --> 00:57:31,018
Yes, I did.

1526
00:57:31,088 --> 00:57:32,648
For how many years?

1527
00:57:33,448 --> 00:57:35,248
I lived in there for about five years.

1528
00:57:35,688 --> 00:57:36,988
- Good. - He would know then.

1529
00:57:36,988 --> 00:57:39,288
- It's interesting. - What were you doing?

1530
00:57:39,818 --> 00:57:41,188
Why would you ask that?

1531
00:57:41,188 --> 00:57:45,388
We have to find a nomad whose last name is Borjigit.

1532
00:57:46,918 --> 00:57:49,218
- What? - Borjigit.

1533
00:57:49,718 --> 00:57:50,948
Borjigit?

1534
00:57:50,948 --> 00:57:52,818
(He lived in Mongolia for 5 years.)

1535
00:57:52,818 --> 00:57:57,318
(At least one of his friends in Mongolia must be Borjigit.)

1536
00:57:57,318 --> 00:57:59,018
I've never heard of that name before.

1537
00:57:59,018 --> 00:58:01,018
- Oh, no. - That's not good.

1538
00:58:01,018 --> 00:58:03,118
You should've lived here longer, Chan Hyuk.

1539
00:58:03,348 --> 00:58:04,348
Well...

1540
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:08,048
Ask him another place other than Terelj to meet nomads.

1541
00:58:08,048 --> 00:58:10,148
Is Terelj the closest place?

1542
00:58:10,718 --> 00:58:13,018
That's the most famous place.

1543
00:58:13,018 --> 00:58:14,148
Then we should go there.

1544
00:58:14,148 --> 00:58:15,818
- Yes. - Let's go there.

1545
00:58:15,818 --> 00:58:17,518
- Thank you. - Thanks, Chan Hyuk.

1546
00:58:17,518 --> 00:58:18,718
Thank you.

1547
00:58:19,148 --> 00:58:21,888
(Thanks for taking Jae Seok's call when you're not even close to him.)

1548
00:58:21,988 --> 00:58:24,148
I guess there aren't that many people with that name.

1549
00:58:24,148 --> 00:58:25,988
(They won't be able to milk sheep at this rate.)

1550
00:58:25,988 --> 00:58:26,988
I know.

1551
00:58:26,988 --> 00:58:28,418
(They won't be able to milk sheep at this rate.)

1552
00:58:29,048 --> 00:58:32,418
Don't you think the distance between the houses will be very far?

1553
00:58:32,418 --> 00:58:33,648
- Right. - It's vast after all.

1554
00:58:33,988 --> 00:58:35,818
If we couldn't find them in one house,

1555
00:58:35,818 --> 00:58:37,218
we would have to take a long time...

1556
00:58:37,218 --> 00:58:38,418
- to arrive at another house. - She's right.

1557
00:58:38,418 --> 00:58:40,618
I think we should rent horses.

1558
00:58:40,618 --> 00:58:42,948
(I think we should rent horses.)

1559
00:58:43,088 --> 00:58:44,088
(Do they rent out horses in Mongolia?)

1560
00:58:44,088 --> 00:58:45,918
- Can you? - Sure.

1561
00:58:46,248 --> 00:58:47,748
They'll rent out ponies probably.

1562
00:58:49,218 --> 00:58:53,888
(No, they're big horses. Cowards won't be able to ride on them.)

1563
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:56,518
- They're ponies. - Let's do that.

1564
00:58:56,518 --> 00:58:59,588
(Whatever the case, they must head to the wilderness.)

1565
00:58:59,588 --> 00:59:01,218
Let's do that.

1566
00:59:01,318 --> 00:59:03,148
Let's eat first and move on.

1567
00:59:04,148 --> 00:59:05,148
- Goodness. - Great.

1568
00:59:05,148 --> 00:59:09,118
(Their soul food is served to relieve their anxiety.)

1569
00:59:09,118 --> 00:59:10,948
- Thank you. - It smells so good.

1570
00:59:10,948 --> 00:59:12,418
Can we have a bowl of rice?

1571
00:59:12,418 --> 00:59:15,248
(It reminds you of your mother's cooking.)

1572
00:59:15,248 --> 00:59:16,418
It's great.

1573
00:59:17,048 --> 00:59:18,488
My stomach feels much better with this.

1574
00:59:19,118 --> 00:59:20,318
- Does it? - Yes.

1575
00:59:21,318 --> 00:59:26,088
(They need to have spicy food even when they're outside of Korea.)

1576
00:59:26,618 --> 00:59:28,518
Mongolian dishes will be served soon, right?

1577
00:59:28,518 --> 00:59:31,218
(Mongolian dishes will be served soon, right?)

1578
00:59:31,748 --> 00:59:34,048
(Laughing)

1579
00:59:34,088 --> 00:59:35,348
- Well... - What?

1580
00:59:36,188 --> 00:59:39,118
Why do you keep glancing at the staff?

1581
00:59:40,048 --> 00:59:41,318
(Did you notice it?)

1582
00:59:41,318 --> 00:59:43,188
- My goodness. - Seok Jin did?

1583
00:59:43,188 --> 00:59:44,988
- I didn't. - Well...

1584
00:59:44,988 --> 00:59:48,088
One of the staff said this a moment ago.

1585
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:51,548
"It's good to have Korean food, but since we're in Mongolia,"

1586
00:59:51,618 --> 00:59:55,588
"let's film your enjoying Mongolian food."

1587
00:59:55,588 --> 00:59:58,188
But he again mentioned not to mind what he said.

1588
00:59:58,188 --> 01:00:00,518
So Seok Jin has been glancing at that staff.

1589
01:00:00,518 --> 01:00:02,518
(Seok Jin felt uncomfortable ever since then.)

1590
01:00:02,518 --> 01:00:04,948
He really missed Korean food,

1591
01:00:05,048 --> 01:00:06,318
but he pretended to like Mongolian food.

1592
01:00:06,318 --> 01:00:07,888
(He couldn't express how he really felt.)

1593
01:00:09,718 --> 01:00:10,948
(Mongolian food?)

1594
01:00:12,048 --> 01:00:13,188
(Mongolian food?)

1595
01:00:13,988 --> 01:00:17,818
(He shouted for Mongolian food and tried to avoid Korean restaurants.)

1596
01:00:17,818 --> 01:00:21,948
(At last, he chose the restaurant where he can have Korean food too.)

1597
01:00:22,818 --> 01:00:25,218
He went, "Yes, Mongolian food."

1598
01:00:25,218 --> 01:00:26,918
- And he... - I felt uncomfortable.

1599
01:00:26,918 --> 01:00:28,218
whispered...

1600
01:00:28,218 --> 01:00:30,188
that he craved kimchi jjigae.

1601
01:00:30,188 --> 01:00:31,788
(Seek Jin's honest opinion.)

1602
01:00:31,788 --> 01:00:33,048
But on the outside...

1603
01:00:33,048 --> 01:00:35,718
I wish I could taste another Mongolian food.

1604
01:00:35,718 --> 01:00:37,718
It's good to see you work hard.

1605
01:00:37,718 --> 01:00:39,418
Sure.

1606
01:00:39,418 --> 01:00:40,888
(It's good to see him work hard.)

1607
01:00:42,118 --> 01:00:44,588
(Now that they're done eating, let's go to the wilderness!)

1608
01:00:44,588 --> 01:00:46,618
- Let's go! - Go, go.

1609
01:00:46,618 --> 01:00:49,688
Now, we're heading to milk sheep.

1610
01:00:50,048 --> 01:00:52,118
I don't think I can milk sheep though.

1611
01:00:52,588 --> 01:00:54,818
1L is quite a bit.

1612
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:57,618
Are you sure you're worried? I think you're sleepy instead.

1613
01:00:58,118 --> 01:01:00,148
Still, I have to participate in the filming.

1614
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,288
I can't just sleep right away.

1615
01:01:03,918 --> 01:01:07,448
I heard it's at least a 2-hour trip to the wilderness.

1616
01:01:07,948 --> 01:01:10,048
It takes at least 2 hours from here.

1617
01:01:10,218 --> 01:01:11,688
There won't be any restrooms either.

1618
01:01:13,148 --> 01:01:15,218
It feels like we're going far away.

1619
01:01:15,888 --> 01:01:18,388
- We're going far away. - Look at the sky.

1620
01:01:19,048 --> 01:01:20,718
- It's pretty. - Right.

1621
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:24,748
It's starting to feel real that we're in Mongolia.

1622
01:01:24,918 --> 01:01:27,788
- Mongolia. - Look, it's yurt.

1623
01:01:28,048 --> 01:01:29,218
Yurt!

1624
01:01:29,448 --> 01:01:31,188
Don't they look like marshmallows?

1625
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:32,818
(They spot yurts which are the symbol of Mongolia.)

1626
01:01:32,818 --> 01:01:35,088
We're escaping from the stuffy city.

1627
01:01:35,218 --> 01:01:36,518
(Taking pictures is a must...)

1628
01:01:36,518 --> 01:01:38,148
(when witnessing an amazing landscape like this.)

1629
01:01:38,348 --> 01:01:41,018
(Taking photos)

1630
01:01:41,018 --> 01:01:44,288
- What's that? - It's a statue of Genghis Khan.

1631
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:45,848
It's so cool.

1632
01:01:45,848 --> 01:01:47,348
(The huge statue of Genghis Khan is looking over the vast meadows.)

1633
01:01:48,348 --> 01:01:50,248
(Taking pictures)

1634
01:01:50,418 --> 01:01:51,788
I love it here.

1635
01:01:51,788 --> 01:01:53,018
(I love Mongolia.)

1636
01:01:53,018 --> 01:01:54,148
It's so extensive.

1637
01:01:54,148 --> 01:01:56,618
There are many houses at the foot of the mountain over there.

1638
01:01:56,618 --> 01:01:58,988
- That mountain looks amazing. - It's so cool.

1639
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:02,188
- The mountains have no trees. - No.

1640
01:02:02,188 --> 01:02:04,748
- It's covered with grass. - It's interesting.

1641
01:02:04,748 --> 01:02:06,288
They're bald.

1642
01:02:07,388 --> 01:02:10,618
Why are the mountains covered with grass?

1643
01:02:10,618 --> 01:02:12,448
- Didn't I just say that? - You did.

1644
01:02:13,788 --> 01:02:16,448
You never know which part the producer will use.

1645
01:02:16,448 --> 01:02:17,648
(He cares about the producer.)

1646
01:02:17,848 --> 01:02:20,348
We should say it a few times so he can choose the best one.

1647
01:02:20,348 --> 01:02:21,518
(It's for the producer's sake.)

1648
01:02:21,918 --> 01:02:23,488
Oh, there are cows.

1649
01:02:24,148 --> 01:02:26,088
I see milk cows.

1650
01:02:26,088 --> 01:02:27,618
(They finally find milk-producing animals.)

1651
01:02:27,648 --> 01:02:28,888
They must be happy.

1652
01:02:28,888 --> 01:02:31,048
- The cows here look so happy. - This is nice.

1653
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:33,988
They can just graze anywhere.

1654
01:02:33,988 --> 01:02:35,148
There's so much grass.

1655
01:02:36,748 --> 01:02:38,288
We're in trouble.

1656
01:02:38,288 --> 01:02:40,018
I haven't seen any sheep on the way yet.

1657
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:41,548
- Really? - Yes.

1658
01:02:41,648 --> 01:02:43,148
I only see cows.

1659
01:02:43,588 --> 01:02:47,018
We have to find sheep, and the owner has to be a Borjigit.

1660
01:02:47,018 --> 01:02:48,518
This is hard.

1661
01:02:48,988 --> 01:02:51,918
They're sheep! Are they cows?

1662
01:02:51,918 --> 01:02:54,048
- They're sheep! - They're sheep!

1663
01:02:54,048 --> 01:02:55,688
- Are they goats? - Are they goats?

1664
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:56,748
Are they goats or sheep?

1665
01:02:56,748 --> 01:02:57,818
- They're goats. - They're goats.

1666
01:02:57,818 --> 01:02:59,448
- They have beards. - Are they goats?

1667
01:02:59,448 --> 01:03:00,548
I got so excited.

1668
01:03:00,548 --> 01:03:01,888
- I thought they were sheep. - There are no sheep.

1669
01:03:01,888 --> 01:03:04,388
How can there be no sheep in these vast meadows?

1670
01:03:05,018 --> 01:03:08,288
(Will we be able to even start the mission?)

1671
01:03:08,648 --> 01:03:11,848
(Team Mongolia's mission is meeting nomads and milking the sheep.)

1672
01:03:11,848 --> 01:03:15,288
(Team Russia's mission is catching king crabs and 10 kinds of fish.)

1673
01:03:15,288 --> 01:03:18,348
(If they fail, they'll be sent to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

1674
01:03:18,348 --> 01:03:23,018
(The team leaders can exclude two members from the trip.)

1675
01:03:23,218 --> 01:03:24,588
Stop it!

1676
01:03:24,788 --> 01:03:28,488
(The last chance: Who will survive?)

1677
01:03:29,788 --> 01:03:31,218
We have to show them.

1678
01:03:31,288 --> 01:03:33,048
We can't lose to Team Mongolia!

1679
01:03:33,248 --> 01:03:34,388
- You're right! - You're right!

1680
01:03:34,388 --> 01:03:35,718
They're just old men!

1681
01:03:35,718 --> 01:03:36,988
- You're right. - You're right.

1682
01:03:36,988 --> 01:03:39,188
We should win. We should show them the power of youth!

1683
01:03:39,188 --> 01:03:40,188
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

1684
01:03:40,188 --> 01:03:41,388
We know only one word.

1685
01:03:41,718 --> 01:03:43,988
- Success! - Success!

1686
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:45,388
- What? - Success!

1687
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:46,688
- What? - Success!

1688
01:03:46,688 --> 01:03:48,648
It's success. Show them.

1689
01:03:48,648 --> 01:03:51,748
- Success. - Success.

1690
01:03:51,748 --> 01:03:53,418
We each need to catch three kinds.

1691
01:03:53,418 --> 01:03:54,888
- Good. - 2 or 3.

1692
01:03:54,888 --> 01:03:57,188
Jong Kook, you can catch just 1. We'll catch 3 each.

1693
01:03:57,818 --> 01:04:00,348
Don't tell me what to do.

1694
01:04:00,988 --> 01:04:03,388
(I'm the team leader.)

1695
01:04:03,388 --> 01:04:05,118
- Are you crazy? - It's my choice.

1696
01:04:05,118 --> 01:04:07,648
- What's with you? - I decide what I do.

1697
01:04:07,648 --> 01:04:09,588
You have to catch fish.

1698
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:12,148
I just need to enjoy.

1699
01:04:12,148 --> 01:04:13,748
- You're right. - I'm happy.

1700
01:04:13,748 --> 01:04:15,848
- You're absolutely right. - Right?

1701
01:04:15,848 --> 01:04:17,288
As soon as we arrive,

1702
01:04:17,288 --> 01:04:19,148
let's get to work.

1703
01:04:19,148 --> 01:04:20,918
- Okay. - Good.

1704
01:04:20,918 --> 01:04:23,218
- Is this "Real Men"? - Exactly.

1705
01:04:23,218 --> 01:04:24,248
I don't know anymore.

1706
01:04:24,248 --> 01:04:26,918
At first, I thought it was just role-play.

1707
01:04:26,918 --> 01:04:28,148
But we've been doing it all day.

1708
01:04:28,148 --> 01:04:29,918
- I know. - I'm confused.

1709
01:04:30,048 --> 01:04:31,088
It's not role-play.

1710
01:04:31,088 --> 01:04:32,388
- Applause. - Applause.

1711
01:04:32,548 --> 01:04:34,718
(They begin the operation with an applause.)

1712
01:04:36,448 --> 01:04:43,418
(Fix a herring on the hook.)

1713
01:04:43,418 --> 01:04:46,618
I don't have a fishing rod.

1714
01:04:46,618 --> 01:04:53,388
(Lower the hook to the bottom of the sea.)

1715
01:04:53,388 --> 01:04:59,818
(Wait 20 to 30 minutes without moving the fishing rod.)

1716
01:05:00,748 --> 01:05:01,948
Do we just wait?

1717
01:05:02,088 --> 01:05:06,818
(It's important to reel in the line at the right time.)

1718
01:05:06,818 --> 01:05:08,448
It's on the bottom?

1719
01:05:09,718 --> 01:05:11,188
The crab approaches and...

1720
01:05:11,188 --> 01:05:15,918
(Near the coast, they use a traditional method.)

1721
01:05:15,918 --> 01:05:17,948
(If you're lucky, you can even catch many king crabs.)

1722
01:05:17,948 --> 01:05:19,348
Does it catch just one?

1723
01:05:21,948 --> 01:05:25,448
(Will Team Jong Kook succeed in catching Russian king crabs?)

1724
01:05:25,448 --> 01:05:26,518
Try it.

1725
01:05:26,518 --> 01:05:28,888
(While waiting for king crabs, they try catching 10 kinds of fish.)

1726
01:05:28,888 --> 01:05:29,988
Our leader.

1727
01:05:29,988 --> 01:05:32,218
(Jong Kook demonstrates.)

1728
01:05:34,218 --> 01:05:36,488
He's not even affected by the result. Why is he doing that?

1729
01:05:37,748 --> 01:05:39,448
Should we start a riot?

1730
01:05:40,218 --> 01:05:41,418
Kwang Soo, don't betray us.

1731
01:05:41,788 --> 01:05:43,288
I want to...

1732
01:05:43,288 --> 01:05:44,488
push him into the sea.

1733
01:05:45,388 --> 01:05:46,988
I want to kick him into the sea.

1734
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:49,088
I want to kick him.

1735
01:05:50,388 --> 01:05:52,448
Sir, I think these guys will kick you into the sea.

1736
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:53,718
Be careful.

1737
01:05:53,888 --> 01:05:57,088
(Jong Kook, watch out for these betrayers.)

1738
01:05:57,948 --> 01:05:59,488
What are you doing?

1739
01:05:59,488 --> 01:06:01,448
Kwang Soo and Se Chan were talking about it.

1740
01:06:02,188 --> 01:06:05,148
(Do you like experiencing horrors?)

1741
01:06:05,888 --> 01:06:06,888
Hey.

1742
01:06:07,288 --> 01:06:10,148
- Is this how you're going to do it? - I'm just playing.

1743
01:06:11,018 --> 01:06:12,418
Here are fishing rods.

1744
01:06:12,418 --> 01:06:14,218
(With additional fishing rods, they'll start the mission.)

1745
01:06:14,218 --> 01:06:15,888
Let's do this according to the hierarchy.

1746
01:06:16,988 --> 01:06:18,948
Since when do we have a rank?

1747
01:06:19,818 --> 01:06:22,188
- What is this? - You use your hands.

1748
01:06:23,788 --> 01:06:26,988
(Jong Kook is fishing relaxingly.)

1749
01:06:26,988 --> 01:06:28,148
Okay.

1750
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:30,548
(Tense)

1751
01:06:30,788 --> 01:06:33,748
I feel something.

1752
01:06:33,748 --> 01:06:36,988
(Already?)

1753
01:06:38,418 --> 01:06:40,318
(Everyone's stirred up.)

1754
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:41,348
Do you feel something?

1755
01:06:43,118 --> 01:06:45,148
Maybe not.

1756
01:06:47,118 --> 01:06:49,118
- Yes. - Yes?

1757
01:06:49,118 --> 01:06:50,748
(It's there.)

1758
01:06:51,588 --> 01:06:53,148
- Did you catch something? - I think so.

1759
01:06:53,148 --> 01:06:55,318
(Excited)

1760
01:06:55,318 --> 01:06:56,448
Wait.

1761
01:06:57,848 --> 01:07:01,588
(He reels in the line carefully.)

1762
01:07:01,588 --> 01:07:03,118
I've never seen this before.

1763
01:07:03,118 --> 01:07:04,388
It's heavy.

1764
01:07:04,388 --> 01:07:06,458
(He's battling with the fish.)

1765
01:07:06,458 --> 01:07:07,718
You must have caught something.

1766
01:07:08,748 --> 01:07:10,718
- You caught something. - You caught something.

1767
01:07:11,348 --> 01:07:12,488
Are you sure?

1768
01:07:12,488 --> 01:07:13,548
(What will be on the hook?)

1769
01:07:13,648 --> 01:07:14,748
What is it?

1770
01:07:18,748 --> 01:07:22,388
(He catches a fish.)

1771
01:07:24,848 --> 01:07:28,818
(He catches a big one as soon as he starts.)

1772
01:07:31,958 --> 01:07:33,848
It's a flatfish.

1773
01:07:33,848 --> 01:07:35,488
(Flatfish)

1774
01:07:37,588 --> 01:07:39,548
- It's cute. - You caught one.

1775
01:07:39,748 --> 01:07:42,288
Can you remove the hook? You're so brave.

1776
01:07:42,288 --> 01:07:43,918
(Se Chan skillfully removes the hook.)

1777
01:07:43,918 --> 01:07:45,148
There you go!

1778
01:07:47,888 --> 01:07:51,148
(They catch 1 out of 10 kinds of fish.)

1779
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:54,548
There you go. I caught one.

1780
01:07:56,048 --> 01:07:58,488
- I caught one! - What did you catch?

1781
01:07:58,488 --> 01:08:00,188
- What is it? - I told you!

1782
01:08:00,188 --> 01:08:02,118
What is it?

1783
01:08:02,548 --> 01:08:03,748
What is it?

1784
01:08:03,748 --> 01:08:05,348
What happened?

1785
01:08:05,348 --> 01:08:06,618
What is that?

1786
01:08:07,288 --> 01:08:09,548
- It's a pollack. - It's a pollack.

1787
01:08:10,488 --> 01:08:11,958
It's a pollack!

1788
01:08:12,148 --> 01:08:13,388
You can really catch them.

1789
01:08:13,688 --> 01:08:15,618
I felt it.

1790
01:08:16,148 --> 01:08:19,958
- We caught a pollack! - Haha caught it!

1791
01:08:20,218 --> 01:08:21,548
This is amazing.

1792
01:08:21,548 --> 01:08:24,548
- I feel so happy. - Take a picture.

1793
01:08:24,548 --> 01:08:25,848
You caught it.

1794
01:08:26,048 --> 01:08:27,988
1, 2, 3.

1795
01:08:28,588 --> 01:08:33,188
(Monthly Running Man)

1796
01:08:34,218 --> 01:08:36,818
- Okay! It feels good. - Did you catch one?

1797
01:08:36,848 --> 01:08:39,048
Really? The rod is bending.

1798
01:08:39,818 --> 01:08:41,318
It's a pollack!

1799
01:08:41,318 --> 01:08:43,348
Okay!

1800
01:08:43,718 --> 01:08:45,188
It's huge.

1801
01:08:47,318 --> 01:08:49,348
There are so many pollacks. Kwang Soo, remove the hook.

1802
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,958
- Me? - Don't slack off.

1803
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:53,218
(You can't even touch a fish.)

1804
01:08:54,488 --> 01:08:55,848
You do the chores.

1805
01:08:56,188 --> 01:08:58,388
Hold the fish with your hands.

1806
01:08:59,588 --> 01:09:01,418
- Hold it there. - Wait.

1807
01:09:01,618 --> 01:09:03,218
Hold it with your hands.

1808
01:09:03,218 --> 01:09:04,688
Wait.

1809
01:09:04,688 --> 01:09:06,248
Remove it.

1810
01:09:07,388 --> 01:09:09,218
Stronger. There you go.

1811
01:09:09,218 --> 01:09:10,488
Put it in the bucket.

1812
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:11,748
Don't squeeze it.

1813
01:09:12,088 --> 01:09:13,388
There you go.

1814
01:09:13,918 --> 01:09:15,188
Be careful.

1815
01:09:17,788 --> 01:09:21,488
(After doing so many chores...)

1816
01:09:21,488 --> 01:09:22,888
I want to catch one too.

1817
01:09:23,648 --> 01:09:25,088
Give me a fishing rod.

1818
01:09:25,388 --> 01:09:26,488
Catch one.

1819
01:09:29,388 --> 01:09:32,248
(I'll catch a big one.)

1820
01:09:34,788 --> 01:09:35,918
(Hasty)

1821
01:09:38,648 --> 01:09:40,348
(Busy)

1822
01:09:43,818 --> 01:09:46,248
(What is he doing?)

1823
01:09:51,248 --> 01:09:52,458
It ran away.

1824
01:09:52,718 --> 01:09:53,988
Here we go.

1825
01:09:54,618 --> 01:09:57,748
(Kwang Soo approaches Haha.)

1826
01:09:59,348 --> 01:10:01,618
Our lines might get tangled. Go away.

1827
01:10:02,218 --> 01:10:04,418
Haha. How can you say that?

1828
01:10:04,418 --> 01:10:07,588
I'm doing great here.

1829
01:10:07,588 --> 01:10:08,888
(Don't cause me any trouble.)

1830
01:10:08,888 --> 01:10:09,988
I caught one!

1831
01:10:09,988 --> 01:10:11,288
- Again? - Again?

1832
01:10:11,548 --> 01:10:13,088
Se Chan.

1833
01:10:13,748 --> 01:10:15,388
This is big.

1834
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:18,288
It's coming up!

1835
01:10:18,288 --> 01:10:20,548
- It's a flatfish! - It is!

1836
01:10:20,548 --> 01:10:21,888
Good!

1837
01:10:22,388 --> 01:10:24,818
Great. Kwang Soo, hurry and remove the hook.

1838
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:28,918
Wait, I'm stuck.

1839
01:10:31,148 --> 01:10:33,618
My arm. Get me off.

1840
01:10:33,618 --> 01:10:35,388
Gosh, you're such a handful.

1841
01:10:36,748 --> 01:10:39,818
- What should we do? It's torn. - It's torn.

1842
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:41,188
Wear gloves.

1843
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:42,958
What is this?

1844
01:10:42,958 --> 01:10:44,718
(He's such a high-maintenance member.)

1845
01:10:46,718 --> 01:10:48,648
- I think it's a pollack. - Is it a pollack?

1846
01:10:48,648 --> 01:10:49,688
(Everyone's doing great except Kwang Soo.)

1847
01:10:49,688 --> 01:10:51,688
- A pollack! - Yes!

1848
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:54,988
It's a pollack!

1849
01:10:56,088 --> 01:10:59,248
Did you catch another one? Again? What is it?

1850
01:10:59,248 --> 01:11:02,718
- It's the biggest so far. - What did you catch?

1851
01:11:02,718 --> 01:11:04,188
Is it a pollack again?

1852
01:11:04,288 --> 01:11:05,488
Gosh.

1853
01:11:05,488 --> 01:11:08,958
Today's champion. I caught two at once.

1854
01:11:09,648 --> 01:11:12,458
2 birds with 1 stone.

1855
01:11:12,458 --> 01:11:14,088
Call me Pollack from now on.

1856
01:11:15,118 --> 01:11:16,888
I'm the best pollack catcher.

1857
01:11:18,548 --> 01:11:19,918
Lower it to the bottom.

1858
01:11:19,918 --> 01:11:21,788
If you stay still, it'll start to move.

1859
01:11:21,788 --> 01:11:24,588
Then raise the rod and reel in the line.

1860
01:11:24,718 --> 01:11:27,318
It'll start to move. Keep it on the bottom.

1861
01:11:28,148 --> 01:11:29,318
Did you catch one?

1862
01:11:29,888 --> 01:11:31,748
- What do I do now? - Reel in the line.

1863
01:11:32,148 --> 01:11:33,788
No. Reel in the line.

1864
01:11:34,488 --> 01:11:35,788
No. There you go.

1865
01:11:35,818 --> 01:11:37,888
- Did you catch something? - I caught something!

1866
01:11:37,888 --> 01:11:39,618
- Kwang Soo caught something! - Look at this!

1867
01:11:39,618 --> 01:11:42,548
(Finally, Kwang Soo also catches a fish.)

1868
01:11:43,688 --> 01:11:46,288
Kwang Soo finally caught one.

1869
01:11:46,288 --> 01:11:47,618
- I caught something. - Kwang Soo.

1870
01:11:47,618 --> 01:11:49,118
I definitely caught something.

1871
01:11:49,118 --> 01:11:52,248
I think I caught a shark! It feels like a dolphin!

1872
01:11:52,248 --> 01:11:53,318
Here it comes.

1873
01:11:54,688 --> 01:11:58,458
(He caught something heavy.)

1874
01:11:58,458 --> 01:12:02,188
(What type of seafood did he catch?)

1875
01:12:02,188 --> 01:12:03,458
Here it comes.

1876
01:12:04,548 --> 01:12:06,988
Gosh, Kwang Soo. Pull it up.

1877
01:12:06,988 --> 01:12:08,188
- What's that? - What is it?

1878
01:12:13,288 --> 01:12:14,688
- Did I catch something? - Pull it up.

1879
01:12:14,688 --> 01:12:16,148
(What is it?)

1880
01:12:16,148 --> 01:12:17,718
What did I catch?

1881
01:12:17,718 --> 01:12:19,648
(What's this?)

1882
01:12:20,488 --> 01:12:21,988
This is amazing.

1883
01:12:22,118 --> 01:12:23,188
What happened?

1884
01:12:23,488 --> 01:12:25,018
How did I catch this?

1885
01:12:25,618 --> 01:12:26,718
Did you catch this?

1886
01:12:26,718 --> 01:12:28,818
(What is your name?)

1887
01:12:30,188 --> 01:12:31,718
I caught a starfish.

1888
01:12:31,718 --> 01:12:34,088
- He caught a starfish. - I caught a starfish.

1889
01:12:34,088 --> 01:12:37,088
- It's a starfish. - He caught a starfish.

1890
01:12:37,088 --> 01:12:39,188
I caught a large starfish.

1891
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,048
He knows how to entertain.

1892
01:12:41,048 --> 01:12:42,348
I caught a starfish!

1893
01:12:42,348 --> 01:12:43,488
(He catches a rare starfish.)

1894
01:12:44,218 --> 01:12:46,918
- I'm embarrassed of myself. - I felt something heavy.

1895
01:12:46,918 --> 01:12:48,648
(They have caught 3 kinds in total.)

1896
01:12:49,748 --> 01:12:51,548
I caught a mysterious being.

1897
01:12:51,548 --> 01:12:53,188
(Kwang Soo is impressive.)

1898
01:12:53,188 --> 01:12:58,418
(Currently, they caught three types of seafood.)

1899
01:12:59,288 --> 01:13:00,418
(Team Ji Hyo looks for sheep.)

1900
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:01,818
There aren't many houses.

1901
01:13:03,248 --> 01:13:05,048
We're traveling off-road.

1902
01:13:06,088 --> 01:13:08,148
- Okay. - Goodness.

1903
01:13:08,148 --> 01:13:09,588
(They approach off-road to find sheep.)

1904
01:13:09,648 --> 01:13:12,018
(At that moment,)

1905
01:13:12,018 --> 01:13:13,088
(something catches their attention.)

1906
01:13:13,088 --> 01:13:14,218
Unbelievable.

1907
01:13:15,018 --> 01:13:16,418
This is incredible.

1908
01:13:17,088 --> 01:13:19,088
Mongolia is...

1909
01:13:19,088 --> 01:13:21,318
- amazing. - It's incredible.

1910
01:13:23,418 --> 01:13:24,618
(They arrive at...)

1911
01:13:24,618 --> 01:13:25,648
(the plain in Terelj.)

1912
01:13:25,648 --> 01:13:27,518
It's so peaceful here.

1913
01:13:27,748 --> 01:13:28,988
I've never seen it.

1914
01:13:30,548 --> 01:13:32,388
It's a peaceful place.

1915
01:13:33,088 --> 01:13:35,018
This is amazing.

1916
01:13:35,018 --> 01:13:37,018
(Mongolia is impressive.)

1917
01:13:37,018 --> 01:13:39,648
- It's impressive. - On a horse, Genghis Khan...

1918
01:13:39,648 --> 01:13:42,188
- Right. - conquered the world.

1919
01:13:42,188 --> 01:13:43,918
(The spirit of Genghis Khan remains.)

1920
01:13:44,118 --> 01:13:46,318
- Is that a hawk? - Isn't that an eagle?

1921
01:13:46,318 --> 01:13:47,488
Is it an eagle?

1922
01:13:47,488 --> 01:13:48,748
It's a large bird.

1923
01:13:48,748 --> 01:13:49,788
(They even see a hawk.)

1924
01:13:49,788 --> 01:13:52,588
- It's so beautiful here. - It's right in front of us.

1925
01:13:54,148 --> 01:13:55,888
There's absolutely nothing here.

1926
01:13:55,888 --> 01:13:56,988
I know.

1927
01:13:57,318 --> 01:13:59,218
You won't bump into anything even if...

1928
01:13:59,218 --> 01:14:01,248
- you drive with your eyes closed. - Exactly.

1929
01:14:03,388 --> 01:14:06,748
I've never seen such a wide plain.

1930
01:14:07,218 --> 01:14:08,848
(They keep driving without an end.)

1931
01:14:08,848 --> 01:14:11,388
- How is this possible? - I know.

1932
01:14:11,748 --> 01:14:13,588
The plain never ends.

1933
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:16,958
Where are the sheep?

1934
01:14:17,718 --> 01:14:20,418
I bet we could find a flock of sheep here.

1935
01:14:21,488 --> 01:14:22,888
- We have to find Borjigit. - That would be great.

1936
01:14:22,888 --> 01:14:24,748
- We must find a Borjigit first. - We need to find them.

1937
01:14:25,018 --> 01:14:26,748
Borjigit has to be the owner.

1938
01:14:26,748 --> 01:14:28,418
Borjigit.

1939
01:14:28,418 --> 01:14:30,618
It's so wide here.

1940
01:14:31,318 --> 01:14:33,118
How can we find a Borjigit?

1941
01:14:33,718 --> 01:14:36,548
Can we find a descendant of Genghis Khan in such a big place?

1942
01:14:36,548 --> 01:14:37,618
(Where could a Borjigit be?)

1943
01:14:39,988 --> 01:14:43,718
- It's so far away. - It really is.

1944
01:14:43,718 --> 01:14:45,788
(The off-trip starts to become difficult.)

1945
01:14:45,788 --> 01:14:47,748
- What if we think... - I found sheep.

1946
01:14:47,748 --> 01:14:49,748
- I found sheep. - There they are.

1947
01:14:49,848 --> 01:14:51,388
- That must be it. - They're sheep.

1948
01:14:52,148 --> 01:14:53,288
There they are.

1949
01:14:53,618 --> 01:14:54,988
There are so many.

1950
01:14:55,348 --> 01:14:57,188
That must be 100 sheep.

1951
01:14:57,688 --> 01:14:59,318
That must be the place.

1952
01:14:59,318 --> 01:15:00,888
(They finally find Mongolian sheep.)

1953
01:15:01,188 --> 01:15:03,048
Are those wild dogs?

1954
01:15:03,048 --> 01:15:04,648
- Where are the dogs? - No.

1955
01:15:04,648 --> 01:15:06,588
- They're running ahead. - Goodness.

1956
01:15:07,458 --> 01:15:09,688
They're very aggressive dogs.

1957
01:15:09,688 --> 01:15:11,548
I know. They seem aggressive.

1958
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:13,788
They're Mongolian dogs.

1959
01:15:13,788 --> 01:15:15,018
(It finally feels like Mongolia.)

1960
01:15:16,318 --> 01:15:17,588
Is this the place?

1961
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:20,388
It must be it.

1962
01:15:21,348 --> 01:15:23,218
(A flock of sheep in the mountains)

1963
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:26,118
(They arrive at a nomad village.)

1964
01:15:28,648 --> 01:15:29,958
- Gosh. - The wind.

1965
01:15:30,248 --> 01:15:32,718
- We traveled very far. - It was far.

1966
01:15:33,318 --> 01:15:35,958
It's very windy here.

1967
01:15:36,148 --> 01:15:37,418
By the way,

1968
01:15:37,748 --> 01:15:39,918
- It was so far. - if we can't find Borjigit here...

1969
01:15:40,188 --> 01:15:42,118
There is no other village here.

1970
01:15:42,458 --> 01:15:46,648
There are a few cautions to take related to customs.

1971
01:15:46,648 --> 01:15:48,618
Perhaps you saw them already.

1972
01:15:48,618 --> 01:15:50,188
- Did you see the dogs? - Yes.

1973
01:15:50,288 --> 01:15:51,648
They were very aggressive.

1974
01:15:51,648 --> 01:15:54,818
The dogs here are very aggressive.

1975
01:15:54,818 --> 01:15:56,458
- I know. - Right.

1976
01:15:56,458 --> 01:16:00,418
This is how the nomads say hello.

1977
01:16:01,118 --> 01:16:03,988
It means, "catch the dogs."

1978
01:16:03,988 --> 01:16:06,818
(Hello means, "catch the dogs.")

1979
01:16:06,818 --> 01:16:08,648
I thought these were rocks.

1980
01:16:09,088 --> 01:16:11,018
- They're goat poop. - They are.

1981
01:16:11,018 --> 01:16:12,688
- Are they poop? - Yes.

1982
01:16:13,188 --> 01:16:15,318
- That's interesting. - It's goat poop.

1983
01:16:16,848 --> 01:16:18,788
- Stop it, So Min. - Why are you touching it?

1984
01:16:18,788 --> 01:16:20,458
Why are you touching the poop?

1985
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:22,388
People stir-fry goat poop and eat it.

1986
01:16:22,688 --> 01:16:25,188
- What? - You can't eat goat poop.

1987
01:16:25,188 --> 01:16:26,848
- Who eats stir-fried goat poop? - It's used as medicine.

1988
01:16:26,988 --> 01:16:28,458
It's good for constipation.

1989
01:16:28,458 --> 01:16:29,988
Who eats stir-fried goat poop?

1990
01:16:29,988 --> 01:16:32,148
You can look it up. It's true, everyone.

1991
01:16:32,148 --> 01:16:34,618
- You stir-fry goat poop? - It's good for constipation.

1992
01:16:34,618 --> 01:16:37,118
- You can't eat it stir-fried. - Do you want some?

1993
01:16:37,288 --> 01:16:41,388
Feces have been used as medicine.

1994
01:16:41,388 --> 01:16:44,418
However, they could be infected with virus or bacteria.

1995
01:16:44,418 --> 01:16:48,418
I recommend you not to consume them.

1996
01:16:48,418 --> 01:16:49,518
(It's confirmed by a professional.)

1997
01:16:50,188 --> 01:16:54,288
Don't step on it. So Min will eat it later.

1998
01:16:54,288 --> 01:16:56,288
We don't have time.

1999
01:16:56,518 --> 01:16:58,748
Let's say hello and ask people.

2000
01:16:58,748 --> 01:17:01,748
- They're riding motorcycles. - Let's ask if they're a Borjigit.

2001
01:17:06,548 --> 01:17:09,188
(They practice saying hello.)

2002
01:17:09,188 --> 01:17:11,848
(Due to the sound of their voice,)

2003
01:17:11,848 --> 01:17:14,048
(the Mongolian nomads come outside.)

2004
01:17:14,048 --> 01:17:16,588
- Hello. - Hello.

2005
01:17:16,588 --> 01:17:17,848
Hello.

2006
01:17:17,848 --> 01:17:19,248
(They meet the nomads for the first time.)

2007
01:17:19,248 --> 01:17:21,288
Hello, sir.

2008
01:17:21,288 --> 01:17:22,318
(Hello.)

2009
01:17:23,288 --> 01:17:26,748
(They finally meet Mongolian nomads.)

2010
01:17:26,748 --> 01:17:29,718
- Here's what's important. - In Mongolia...

2011
01:17:29,718 --> 01:17:32,018
These people have to be...

2012
01:17:32,418 --> 01:17:34,388
- from the Borjigit line. - Right.

2013
01:17:34,918 --> 01:17:37,148
- That's the most important. - They have to be Borjigit.

2014
01:17:37,148 --> 01:17:38,618
If they are, we're good.

2015
01:17:38,618 --> 01:17:41,888
- We just have to milk the sheep. - Then we can leave.

2016
01:17:42,348 --> 01:17:43,648
- Pardon me. - Shall we ask?

2017
01:17:45,348 --> 01:17:48,648
(Are you part of the Borjigit tribe?)

2018
01:17:48,648 --> 01:17:53,458
(Are you part of the Borjigit tribe?)

2019
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:57,888
(Are you Mr. Borjigit?)

2020
01:17:57,888 --> 01:18:00,288
(They traveled for 3 hours.)

2021
01:18:00,288 --> 01:18:03,648
(Is he part of the Borjigit tribe?)

2022
01:18:03,648 --> 01:18:07,288
(Is he a descendant of Genghis Khan?)

2023
01:18:07,288 --> 01:18:09,988
- He's of a different tribe. - I see.

2024
01:18:09,988 --> 01:18:11,488
(He isn't a Borjigit.)

2025
01:18:11,488 --> 01:18:14,118
Is he part of a different tribe?

2026
01:18:14,318 --> 01:18:16,018
He isn't Borjigit.

2027
01:18:16,018 --> 01:18:18,418
Let's not be discouraged. There are other people.

2028
01:18:18,418 --> 01:18:21,148
- Are you a Borjigit? - Are you?

2029
01:18:21,148 --> 01:18:24,288
(Are you Mr. Borjigit?)

2030
01:18:24,288 --> 01:18:29,458
(Is the other man a descendant of Genghis Khan?)

2031
01:18:29,458 --> 01:18:30,748
(He shakes his head.)

2032
01:18:30,748 --> 01:18:32,088
Are you not?

2033
01:18:32,088 --> 01:18:33,748
- They're from the same tribe. - I see.

2034
01:18:33,748 --> 01:18:37,048
- I see. - Are you from Borjigit tribe?

2035
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:39,988
(No, we're part of another tribe.)

2036
01:18:39,988 --> 01:18:42,348
- They aren't here. - Goodness.

2037
01:18:42,348 --> 01:18:43,918
(Is there no Borjigit around here?)

2038
01:18:43,918 --> 01:18:45,288
(He feels sorry.)

2039
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:47,748
- What's this? - What is it?

2040
01:18:47,748 --> 01:18:50,918
It's Mongolian snuff that they offer to the guests.

2041
01:18:50,918 --> 01:18:52,418
- Snuff? - Snuff?

2042
01:18:52,418 --> 01:18:54,458
I read about it before.

2043
01:18:54,458 --> 01:18:57,588
Open the lid, sniff it, and turn it with your right hand.

2044
01:18:57,588 --> 01:18:59,348
(Offering snuff is a welcoming custom.)

2045
01:18:59,348 --> 01:19:03,458
- Don't close it. - Where do I put it to sniff it?

2046
01:19:03,458 --> 01:19:07,188
- Put it on the back of your hand. - I'll put it here.

2047
01:19:07,188 --> 01:19:11,458
(Rejecting the snuff is considered rude. Pass after sniffing lightly.)

2048
01:19:12,388 --> 01:19:14,218
(He's friendly.)

2049
01:19:14,218 --> 01:19:15,618
Do I sniff it?

2050
01:19:17,688 --> 01:19:19,418
- I've seen it in movies. - Sniff it.

2051
01:19:19,718 --> 01:19:21,588
- It seems like... - This is great.

2052
01:19:21,588 --> 01:19:24,518
(It's not made with tobacco leaves but with spices and herbs.)

2053
01:19:24,518 --> 01:19:26,748
(As such, it cleanses the nostrils.)

2054
01:19:26,748 --> 01:19:29,218
(It smells very good.)

2055
01:19:29,218 --> 01:19:30,588
Where is it?

2056
01:19:30,588 --> 01:19:31,888
(It's an unfamiliar fragrance.)

2057
01:19:31,888 --> 01:19:33,588
We should sniff it.

2058
01:19:34,118 --> 01:19:35,988
- The fragrance is... - Does it have a fragrance?

2059
01:19:35,988 --> 01:19:37,288
How shall I describe it?

2060
01:19:37,788 --> 01:19:39,218
I can't find it.

2061
01:19:39,218 --> 01:19:40,588
- I never smelled such fragrance. - I found it.

2062
01:19:40,588 --> 01:19:41,888
It's refreshing.

2063
01:19:41,988 --> 01:19:43,588
Haven't you seen it before?

2064
01:19:46,388 --> 01:19:47,958
That's not how you do it.

2065
01:19:47,958 --> 01:19:51,318
(That's not how you do it.)

2066
01:19:51,318 --> 01:19:52,388
(It's how it's done in movies.)

2067
01:19:52,388 --> 01:19:53,458
Goodness.

2068
01:19:53,818 --> 01:19:55,218
(He imitates people in movies.)

2069
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:56,748
Don't do that.

2070
01:19:57,248 --> 01:19:58,818
- How do I do it? - Give it to me.

2071
01:19:59,048 --> 01:20:00,788
- It's interesting. - It's refreshing.

2072
01:20:00,788 --> 01:20:02,818
Take a little. Hold it first.

2073
01:20:02,818 --> 01:20:05,088
- Hold it tightly. - It's refreshing.

2074
01:20:05,088 --> 01:20:06,248
Block one nostril.

2075
01:20:07,048 --> 01:20:08,788
You don't have to do that.

2076
01:20:09,548 --> 01:20:10,748
It has a fragrance.

2077
01:20:10,748 --> 01:20:12,318
(What is this fragrance?)

2078
01:20:12,318 --> 01:20:14,848
- It has a pleasant fragrance. - It's pleasant.

2079
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:16,648
(It's unfamiliar, but they like it.)

2080
01:20:16,648 --> 01:20:17,818
It's interesting.

2081
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:22,848
Can we visit their home?

2082
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:25,018
Is that okay?

2083
01:20:25,618 --> 01:20:26,648
(Welcome)

2084
01:20:26,648 --> 01:20:27,918
Thank you.

2085
01:20:27,918 --> 01:20:29,218
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2086
01:20:29,218 --> 01:20:30,288
(Thank you.)

2087
01:20:31,288 --> 01:20:32,748
These dogs are calm.

2088
01:20:32,748 --> 01:20:34,248
They're friendly.

2089
01:20:34,248 --> 01:20:35,548
(Welcome)

2090
01:20:37,488 --> 01:20:40,088
- May we go in? - May we go in?

2091
01:20:41,388 --> 01:20:43,488
(They enter a ger for the first time.)

2092
01:20:43,488 --> 01:20:45,088
It's warm inside.

2093
01:20:45,918 --> 01:20:47,788
It's really warm inside.

2094
01:20:50,648 --> 01:20:52,548
(It's nicely decorated.)

2095
01:20:52,548 --> 01:20:54,818
- This is amazing. - It's great.

2096
01:20:54,888 --> 01:20:56,148
It's very...

2097
01:20:56,958 --> 01:20:59,288
- cozy inside. - It's cozy.

2098
01:20:59,288 --> 01:21:01,588
This is for ventilation.

2099
01:21:01,588 --> 01:21:03,218
- Look at this. - What's this?

2100
01:21:04,118 --> 01:21:06,148
It's warm around here.

2101
01:21:06,148 --> 01:21:08,458
- They heat this up. - Right.

2102
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:11,488
We have a gift for you.

2103
01:21:12,548 --> 01:21:14,988
(They give them gifts they bought at the market.)

2104
01:21:14,988 --> 01:21:17,818
(It's nice to meet you.)

2105
01:21:17,818 --> 01:21:18,848
Thank you.

2106
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:21,018
- It must be a heater. - What is this?

2107
01:21:22,318 --> 01:21:23,718
- It's boorsoq. - Boorsoq?

2108
01:21:23,718 --> 01:21:26,418
(Boorsoq is fried dough.)

2109
01:21:26,418 --> 01:21:30,418
(It's one of the main snacks for the nomads.)

2110
01:21:31,188 --> 01:21:34,388
I've seen that on TV.

2111
01:21:34,388 --> 01:21:36,688
- Don't they also offer tea? - Right.

2112
01:21:36,688 --> 01:21:39,588
- They usually offer tea. - To offer tea?

2113
01:21:40,748 --> 01:21:42,648
- For guests, they serve tea. - Do they serve tea?

2114
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:44,048
- They will give us tea? - Yes.

2115
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:46,018
- They are already here. - By the way...

2116
01:21:46,018 --> 01:21:47,288
Look, the water is boiling.

2117
01:21:47,748 --> 01:21:50,318
It's so warm in here. I saw this on TV.

2118
01:21:50,318 --> 01:21:52,218
(She pours cow's milk into the boiling, hot water.)

2119
01:21:52,218 --> 01:21:53,248
I thought...

2120
01:21:53,248 --> 01:21:54,458
(She pours milk into the boiling, hot water.)

2121
01:21:54,458 --> 01:21:56,318
- This is cow's milk. - Cow's milk? I see.

2122
01:21:56,318 --> 01:21:58,088
- This is made of cow's milk? - Yes.

2123
01:21:58,218 --> 01:22:00,118
When I saw this on TV, I was really curious.

2124
01:22:00,118 --> 01:22:02,088
Jae Seok, I was curious about this too.

2125
01:22:02,488 --> 01:22:05,288
After that, this turns into a thick liquid.

2126
01:22:05,288 --> 01:22:06,848
It's really warm in here.

2127
01:22:06,848 --> 01:22:10,618
I think on a windy day, this must be so warm and cozy.

2128
01:22:11,248 --> 01:22:12,588
What is that?

2129
01:22:12,958 --> 01:22:14,488
There's a television.

2130
01:22:15,458 --> 01:22:17,348
Goodness, there's a TV here.

2131
01:22:19,218 --> 01:22:21,318
(Let me introduce his house.)

2132
01:22:21,318 --> 01:22:23,318
(His house has a solar plate...)

2133
01:22:23,318 --> 01:22:24,958
(and a satellite TV.)

2134
01:22:25,918 --> 01:22:27,848
He's slowly showing off his house.

2135
01:22:27,848 --> 01:22:28,848
He is.

2136
01:22:28,848 --> 01:22:30,218
(He pushes the buttons on the remote control.)

2137
01:22:30,588 --> 01:22:34,148
Look. He's using the remote control.

2138
01:22:34,458 --> 01:22:37,648
By the way, I'm quite curious.

2139
01:22:37,918 --> 01:22:40,718
- We have to find a Borjigit. - Borjigit tribe.

2140
01:22:40,718 --> 01:22:41,958
- Borjigit tribe. - Borjigit...

2141
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:43,418
It's Borjigit.

2142
01:22:45,318 --> 01:22:46,418
(Steaming)

2143
01:22:48,018 --> 01:22:49,318
(The steam fills the room.)

2144
01:22:49,318 --> 01:22:50,388
It's overflowing.

2145
01:22:50,848 --> 01:22:53,848
- Gosh, it startled me. - The fire is so strong.

2146
01:22:54,018 --> 01:22:55,388
- It stopped. - This is...

2147
01:22:55,388 --> 01:22:56,418
- This... - What do we do?

2148
01:22:56,418 --> 01:22:58,458
- It's all right. - Okay.

2149
01:22:59,388 --> 01:23:00,418
Yes?

2150
01:23:00,488 --> 01:23:01,848
Goodness, this is what she said.

2151
01:23:01,848 --> 01:23:03,918
"You should have kept an eye on this."

2152
01:23:04,488 --> 01:23:06,648
"We have guests over now."

2153
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:08,848
"All you do is sit and do nothing."

2154
01:23:08,918 --> 01:23:11,748
- That's probably what she said. - Come on.

2155
01:23:11,748 --> 01:23:14,418
(Goodness, you should have kept an eye on this.)

2156
01:23:14,418 --> 01:23:16,648
(We have guests over now.)

2157
01:23:16,648 --> 01:23:18,958
(All you do is sit and do nothing.)

2158
01:23:19,588 --> 01:23:21,458
- I can... - I don't think he's wrong though.

2159
01:23:21,458 --> 01:23:24,218
I can express feelings in this world.

2160
01:23:24,218 --> 01:23:26,288
- She is skimming it. - It looks delicious.

2161
01:23:26,748 --> 01:23:28,388
It smells savory.

2162
01:23:28,388 --> 01:23:29,588
(The nomads' favorite drink is about to be ready.)

2163
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:30,718
This sort of...

2164
01:23:30,718 --> 01:23:32,458
(The nomads' favorite drink is about to be ready.)

2165
01:23:32,458 --> 01:23:33,688
It has a great smell.

2166
01:23:33,688 --> 01:23:34,688
That...

2167
01:23:37,188 --> 01:23:39,388
- What is she saying? - She will filter it with a net.

2168
01:23:40,088 --> 01:23:42,418
She said she will pour the tea, and we will drink that.

2169
01:23:42,418 --> 01:23:43,958
- Really? - Yes.

2170
01:23:43,958 --> 01:23:45,048
You are actually right.

2171
01:23:45,048 --> 01:23:47,418
- He's right? - Didn't I tell you?

2172
01:23:47,588 --> 01:23:49,118
I can translate feelings.

2173
01:23:49,118 --> 01:23:50,318
This is such a mystery.

2174
01:23:50,318 --> 01:23:52,148
- He's right on point. - I can translate feelings.

2175
01:23:52,148 --> 01:23:54,018
Seok Jin, I know everything.

2176
01:23:54,018 --> 01:23:55,918
Where do you get the water?

2177
01:23:57,918 --> 01:23:59,588
I see. There's a well here.

2178
01:23:59,588 --> 01:24:00,588
There's a well.

2179
01:24:01,488 --> 01:24:02,958
How do you know all this?

2180
01:24:02,958 --> 01:24:04,648
I know everything by the feelings.

2181
01:24:04,648 --> 01:24:05,748
- They get it from there. - You said there's a well.

2182
01:24:05,748 --> 01:24:08,048
You are completely right.

2183
01:24:08,488 --> 01:24:09,958
Thank you.

2184
01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:11,588
Since I am the leader...

2185
01:24:11,848 --> 01:24:14,648
No, you are not the leader. Thank you.

2186
01:24:14,648 --> 01:24:15,748
(They receive a cup each.)

2187
01:24:15,748 --> 01:24:16,748
It's milk tea.

2188
01:24:16,748 --> 01:24:19,218
(Milk tea)

2189
01:24:20,418 --> 01:24:22,018
I can smell the milk.

2190
01:24:23,488 --> 01:24:25,588
(They take a sip of the tea she prepared with the utmost care.)

2191
01:24:25,588 --> 01:24:26,788
Gosh, it's hot.

2192
01:24:27,218 --> 01:24:29,688
(A savory smell disperses inside their mouths.)

2193
01:24:29,688 --> 01:24:31,288
Can I put this in the tea?

2194
01:24:31,288 --> 01:24:32,388
(Let me see.)

2195
01:24:32,388 --> 01:24:33,818
- You can. - This is...

2196
01:24:33,818 --> 01:24:34,918
It's sugar?

2197
01:24:35,148 --> 01:24:37,318
Seok Jin, why don't you sit and drink the tea?

2198
01:24:37,318 --> 01:24:40,458
- I'm just putting the sugar in. - You can ask me to pass it to you.

2199
01:24:40,458 --> 01:24:42,458
- This isn't polite. - Why isn't it polite?

2200
01:24:42,458 --> 01:24:44,318
- Do you know about their manners? - Long time ago...

2201
01:24:44,318 --> 01:24:46,018
Do you want to get smacked here?

2202
01:24:46,188 --> 01:24:48,548
- If you did this a long time ago... - Please sit down.

2203
01:24:48,548 --> 01:24:50,588
(I see. I was impolite.)

2204
01:24:50,588 --> 01:24:52,958
- Just sit down. - I'll sit here and talk.

2205
01:24:52,958 --> 01:24:55,588
You might have been fed to the eagles a long time ago.

2206
01:24:55,588 --> 01:24:57,148
(She takes care of the staff as well.)

2207
01:24:57,148 --> 01:24:58,548
You probably were fed to the eagles.

2208
01:24:58,548 --> 01:25:00,418
No, that wasn't what I meant.

2209
01:25:00,488 --> 01:25:02,218
By the way,

2210
01:25:02,458 --> 01:25:04,748
we have to meet someone from the Borjigit tribe.

2211
01:25:04,748 --> 01:25:07,388
Are there anyone from that tribe?

2212
01:25:07,458 --> 01:25:09,748
- He shook his head. - What if no one is here?

2213
01:25:09,748 --> 01:25:13,648
(I don't think they are around here. Go to the other side to meet them.)

2214
01:25:13,648 --> 01:25:15,848
She said they are not around this area.

2215
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:18,918
She said you can go to the other side.

2216
01:25:18,918 --> 01:25:20,248
No one from that tribe is here?

2217
01:25:20,648 --> 01:25:21,848
That's what she said.

2218
01:25:22,118 --> 01:25:24,148
Since we have a long way ahead of us,

2219
01:25:24,148 --> 01:25:26,088
we have to get going.

2220
01:25:26,218 --> 01:25:29,748
I know that drinking everything is an etiquette.

2221
01:25:30,218 --> 01:25:31,348
(That's all right.)

2222
01:25:31,988 --> 01:25:33,548
Has the etiquette changed? We don't have to finish it?

2223
01:25:33,548 --> 01:25:34,818
We don't have to finish the tea?

2224
01:25:35,218 --> 01:25:37,588
He told us to drink as much as we want, didn't he?

2225
01:25:37,718 --> 01:25:38,918
Then I will drink only this much.

2226
01:25:38,918 --> 01:25:40,218
(His skill doesn't even surprise us now.)

2227
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:41,648
(His translation of feelings is 100 percent accurate.)

2228
01:25:41,648 --> 01:25:43,348
- Things have changed here too. - He is...

2229
01:25:43,348 --> 01:25:44,618
He translates...

2230
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:46,348
- That's what he said. - using his hunches.

2231
01:25:46,348 --> 01:25:48,848
"Oh no, you don't have to finish if you don't want to nowadays."

2232
01:25:48,848 --> 01:25:51,118
- "Drink as much as you want." - You are amazing.

2233
01:25:51,118 --> 01:25:53,588
- You really are. - Aren't I?

2234
01:25:53,588 --> 01:25:55,748
(You don't have to finish if you don't want to nowadays.)

2235
01:25:55,748 --> 01:25:57,548
(Drink as much as you want.)

2236
01:25:58,648 --> 01:26:01,818
All right then. Anyway, thank you.

2237
01:26:01,818 --> 01:26:02,848
We should get going.

2238
01:26:02,848 --> 01:26:06,218
(Thank you for your invitation. You are too generous.)

2239
01:26:06,218 --> 01:26:07,588
- It's so warm in here. - Thank you.

2240
01:26:07,588 --> 01:26:09,488
Walk to the right side when you come out.

2241
01:26:10,018 --> 01:26:11,418
We just heard that too.

2242
01:26:11,418 --> 01:26:14,088
Don't pretend you knew about it beforehand.

2243
01:26:14,088 --> 01:26:15,088
(They must go to find the Borjigit tribe.)

2244
01:26:15,088 --> 01:26:17,448
- I have to pee though. - Me too.

2245
01:26:17,448 --> 01:26:18,548
Where can we pee?

2246
01:26:18,548 --> 01:26:20,818
- I think we have to pee over there. - I think so too.

2247
01:26:20,818 --> 01:26:23,218
- You have to climb over that hill. - I have to visit Mother Nature.

2248
01:26:23,588 --> 01:26:25,648
- Aren't people here generous? - They are.

2249
01:26:25,648 --> 01:26:27,918
Your translation skill surprised me again.

2250
01:26:27,918 --> 01:26:29,388
- You saw my skill, didn't you? - Goodness.

2251
01:26:29,548 --> 01:26:30,548
- It's over there. - You were awesome.

2252
01:26:30,548 --> 01:26:32,188
I can communicate with the whole world.

2253
01:26:32,188 --> 01:26:35,148
Jae Seok, you were so good at guessing through their reactions.

2254
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:37,518
- Don't you worry, Ji Hyo. - You were guessing.

2255
01:26:38,048 --> 01:26:40,348
We will be back after we take care of our business.

2256
01:26:40,818 --> 01:26:42,548
(It's time to release before they start a long journey again.)

2257
01:26:42,548 --> 01:26:43,818
- I must go too. - I'll go with you.

2258
01:26:43,818 --> 01:26:45,418
- I'll go to the back. - Men and women are separate.

2259
01:26:45,418 --> 01:26:47,488
As long as there are no cameras, I can take care of it.

2260
01:26:47,818 --> 01:26:50,448
If there are no cameras, we can pee while facing the mountain.

2261
01:26:50,448 --> 01:26:51,818
- I'll keep a watch. - Are you going that way?

2262
01:26:51,818 --> 01:26:53,548
- Yes, we are going this way. - Then we will go this way.

2263
01:26:53,548 --> 01:26:54,918
(They are on their way to empty their stomachs.)

2264
01:26:54,948 --> 01:26:56,188
(Turning back)

2265
01:26:56,248 --> 01:26:59,948
(Are the cameramen still filming us?)

2266
01:26:59,948 --> 01:27:02,418
- Don't let the camera drone fly! - Where is that camera?

2267
01:27:02,548 --> 01:27:04,688
How can you let that camera fly at this time?

2268
01:27:05,648 --> 01:27:06,948
This is so funny.

2269
01:27:06,948 --> 01:27:08,088
(Will Team Ji Hyo be able to find a Borjigit?)

2270
01:27:08,088 --> 01:27:09,588
Hey, don't zoom in.

2271
01:27:12,548 --> 01:27:16,848
(Meanwhile, Team Jong Kook is still fighting with the king crabs.)

2272
01:27:16,848 --> 01:27:18,718
Again? Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

2273
01:27:18,718 --> 01:27:19,948
(It's another flatfish again.)

2274
01:27:19,948 --> 01:27:21,248
I think it's another one.

2275
01:27:21,248 --> 01:27:22,548
(Oh, no. It's a flatfish again.)

2276
01:27:22,548 --> 01:27:24,748
Why do they keep biting our bait?

2277
01:27:24,918 --> 01:27:27,088
I wish we could catch a different type.

2278
01:27:27,588 --> 01:27:29,548
But it seems that's not happening for us.

2279
01:27:30,448 --> 01:27:31,848
(The sun is already setting.)

2280
01:27:31,848 --> 01:27:34,588
Okay. When we catch these fish now,

2281
01:27:34,718 --> 01:27:36,288
I don't feel excited.

2282
01:27:36,288 --> 01:27:37,418
(They keep catching the same kinds of fish.)

2283
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:40,018
(What good is it if their bucket is full with fish?)

2284
01:27:41,148 --> 01:27:42,948
(What is that?)

2285
01:27:43,048 --> 01:27:45,088
Hey, scoop up the jellyfish!

2286
01:27:45,188 --> 01:27:46,588
- Where? - Hurry. It's getting away!

2287
01:27:46,588 --> 01:27:48,588
(It's swimming away.)

2288
01:27:48,588 --> 01:27:52,548
(He catches a glimpse of a creature that resembles a jellyfish.)

2289
01:27:52,548 --> 01:27:53,948
(This is a new species at last!)

2290
01:27:53,948 --> 01:27:55,388
- Where? - Hurry. It's getting away!

2291
01:27:55,388 --> 01:27:56,418
I need a scooping net. Where?

2292
01:27:56,948 --> 01:27:58,848
- Where is it? - It's heading towards that way.

2293
01:27:58,848 --> 01:28:00,318
(He equips himself with the scooping net.)

2294
01:28:01,548 --> 01:28:03,918
(It's time for Kwang Soo to catch one for the team.)

2295
01:28:03,918 --> 01:28:05,148
Se Chan, hold on.

2296
01:28:05,448 --> 01:28:08,218
(I will catch you soon. Wait for me.)

2297
01:28:08,818 --> 01:28:10,118
The jellyfish is here. Kwang Soo, it's right here.

2298
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:12,548
It's right there. Hurry!

2299
01:28:12,548 --> 01:28:14,718
(He spots his target.)

2300
01:28:14,718 --> 01:28:19,448
(After he gets close to the target reaching out his long arm...)

2301
01:28:19,448 --> 01:28:21,588
- There you go. Nice job! - A jellyfish!

2302
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:22,948
(He captures it instantly.)

2303
01:28:23,188 --> 01:28:24,248
- A jellyfish! - Nice job!

2304
01:28:24,248 --> 01:28:26,448
(What is the species of this creature?)

2305
01:28:26,848 --> 01:28:28,488
- A jellyfish! - Nice job!

2306
01:28:28,488 --> 01:28:29,548
I got a jellyfish!

2307
01:28:29,548 --> 01:28:33,818
(They acquire the 4th species, salpa, which resembles a jellyfish.)

2308
01:28:34,748 --> 01:28:36,718
(Swinging)

2309
01:28:37,188 --> 01:28:38,888
Oh, he got 1. Did you catch 1?

2310
01:28:39,348 --> 01:28:43,548
(A fish bites Kwang Soo's bait that's been put out before.)

2311
01:28:43,748 --> 01:28:47,748
(It feels like it might be a king crab. Could it be?)

2312
01:28:48,288 --> 01:28:49,288
Did we catch one?

2313
01:28:49,288 --> 01:28:50,648
(Hurry)

2314
01:28:50,648 --> 01:28:52,648
(Faster)

2315
01:28:52,648 --> 01:28:54,618
- Did you catch it? - Yes.

2316
01:28:55,088 --> 01:28:57,148
- Did you catch it? - Yes, I did.

2317
01:28:57,818 --> 01:29:00,918
(This feels different from before.)

2318
01:29:01,118 --> 01:29:04,748
(Did he catch something?)

2319
01:29:04,748 --> 01:29:07,818
I caught a king crab! I got a king crab!

2320
01:29:08,848 --> 01:29:09,848
Really?

2321
01:29:09,848 --> 01:29:11,748
(Is this really happening? Did you really catch a king crab?)

2322
01:29:11,748 --> 01:29:12,748
King crab!

2323
01:29:13,548 --> 01:29:14,718
I got a king crab!

2324
01:29:14,718 --> 01:29:18,248
(After struggling with the tough sea of Russia,)

2325
01:29:18,248 --> 01:29:21,548
(did Kwang Soo catch a king crab that everyone has been waiting for?)

2326
01:29:21,718 --> 01:29:25,948
(Can Team Russia catch a king crab...)

2327
01:29:25,948 --> 01:29:31,088
(and accomplish their final mission?)

2328
01:29:34,248 --> 01:29:37,318
(Team Jong Kook continues to catch fish with this momentum.)

2329
01:29:39,088 --> 01:29:42,348
(These 3 underlings decide to revolt against the team leader.)

2330
01:29:42,348 --> 01:29:46,048
(Who will be the victor of this muddy fight for rankings?)

2331
01:29:47,188 --> 01:29:52,748
(Kwang Soo wins against the members by winning her heart.)

2332
01:29:52,748 --> 01:29:55,448
(A secret date with a pretty blonde in Vladivostok)

2333
01:29:55,948 --> 01:29:58,088
(I love you, Kwang Soo.)

2334
01:29:59,048 --> 01:30:02,188
(Meanwhile, Team Ji Hyo isn't distracted.)

2335
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:05,148
(They milk the sheep with the Borjigit tribe.)

2336
01:30:05,288 --> 01:30:06,318
This is amazing.

2337
01:30:06,948 --> 01:30:11,118
(At last, the truth of this dangerous destination unfolds.)

2338
01:30:11,118 --> 01:30:14,648
(You'd better be careful...)

2339
01:30:14,648 --> 01:30:17,648
(because...)

2340
01:30:18,848 --> 01:30:21,348
(Dangerous Trip Finale: Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear)

2341
01:30:22,688 --> 01:30:28,818
(Recommend a destination of your choice! Members will visit.)
