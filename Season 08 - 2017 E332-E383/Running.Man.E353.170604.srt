00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,170
(Dangerous tourist attractions picked by bloggers)

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,570
Jae Seok will pick...

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,470
(The dangerous tourist attraction has been decided.)

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:18,770
(Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear in Japan)

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,800
(6 members were chosen to go to the Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,840
(Before leaving the country,)

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,540
(they were given one last chance.)

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,840
What is this?

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,270
(Go to Mongolia and Russia,)

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:35,170
(and seize the last chance to be exempted.)

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,740
Only the two team leaders will get to choose...

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,640
who will be exempted from the penalty.

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,970
(Team Ji Hyo's mission is to find the descendants of Genghis Khan.)

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,740
(Team Jong Kook's mission is to catch 10 kinds of fish.)

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,900
(They travel the grassland and cross the sea.)

17
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,240
(They have started the real, survival battle.)

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,240
(If you want to avoid the Labyrinth, win the team leader's favor.)

19
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,270
(The 6 members try their best in flattering their team leader.)

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,870
(Who will be the one to grab the last chance?)

21
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,170
(And)

22
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,670
(They land on Japan at last.)

23
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,140
(Don't expect anything beforehand.)

24
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,940
(The extreme fear)

25
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,070
(Who will be lucky enough to avoid the Labyrinth?)

26
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:26,965
Please.

27
00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:29,435
(Team Ji Hyo is still searching for Borjigit.)

28
00:01:29,435 --> 00:01:33,435
How will we find the Borjigit family?

29
00:01:33,435 --> 00:01:34,705
(Will they be able to get milk?)

30
00:01:34,805 --> 00:01:39,105
We need to find them as soon as possible because...

31
00:01:39,635 --> 00:01:42,565
- we... - It'll be dangerous when its dark.

32
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:44,535
We have to find them before it gets dark.

33
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,265
We're running out of time.

34
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:47,635
Let's say goodbye.

35
00:01:48,397 --> 00:01:54,697
(It's time to say goodbye to them who have been so generous.)

36
00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:56,435
- Bye! - Bye.

37
00:01:56,835 --> 00:01:58,065
Goodbye.

38
00:01:58,065 --> 00:01:59,405
(We hope you find the Borjigit family.)

39
00:01:59,405 --> 00:02:00,635
Bye.

40
00:02:00,835 --> 00:02:02,065
Goodbye.

41
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:04,005
Bye.

42
00:02:05,265 --> 00:02:06,905
(And they start their journey again.)

43
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:08,165
Borjigit...

44
00:02:08,305 --> 00:02:11,235
I'm not sure if we can milk sheep within today.

45
00:02:11,235 --> 00:02:12,465
(Will they be across this land?)

46
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,605
Amazing.

47
00:02:13,605 --> 00:02:14,905
Look over there.

48
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:16,765
(Will they be across this land?)

49
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,605
- There's one. - Look over there.

50
00:02:20,605 --> 00:02:21,675
(They find another ger.)

51
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:22,805
Let's look for them over there.

52
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:27,565
We will end up going to the Labyrinth if we can't find them.

53
00:02:27,865 --> 00:02:29,265
Those cows look like they're from Korea.

54
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:30,865
Nonsense.

55
00:02:30,865 --> 00:02:33,175
- They're not. - They aren't from Korea.

56
00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:35,835
- Their color is like Korean cows. - They're Mongolian cows.

57
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:38,105
- Really. - Be careful not to get struck.

58
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:41,305
- Its horns are very sharp. - If you get struck by it,

59
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:44,365
- They're not like Korean cows. - you'll get hurt for certain.

60
00:02:45,105 --> 00:02:46,605
- Hello. - Hello.

61
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:48,835
(Hello, ma'am.)

62
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:50,965
(Ignoring)

63
00:02:51,335 --> 00:02:53,165
(She goes inside to prepare for the greeting.)

64
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:55,365
- Ma'am. - I hear a baby sound.

65
00:02:55,665 --> 00:02:57,105
- She went in to treat us already. - Well...

66
00:02:57,105 --> 00:02:58,405
Oh, no. We don't have much time left.

67
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:00,705
She's bringing something to treat us.

68
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:01,905
- Goodness. - Really?

69
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:04,665
Well... What was it?

70
00:03:04,905 --> 00:03:06,735
- The right foot first? - Your right foot.

71
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:10,935
(Open the door with your left hand and enter with your right foot.)

72
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:18,565
She says to enjoy the aaruul.

73
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:19,765
Thank you.

74
00:03:20,235 --> 00:03:22,635
- Aaruul? - Dried milk.

75
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,305
- Oh, that? - That...

76
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:25,435
Aaruul...

77
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:27,065
What is this?

78
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:28,205
(A few hours ago at the market)

79
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:29,765
Aaruul.

80
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:32,265
(They found a Mongolian, traditional snack.)

81
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:40,335
(The strong taste passed through their throats and noses.)

82
00:03:40,335 --> 00:03:41,535
This is...

83
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:43,835
I heard...

84
00:03:44,705 --> 00:03:46,605
the exact description...

85
00:03:46,605 --> 00:03:48,565
of its taste from the native.

86
00:03:48,565 --> 00:03:52,265
- It smells like a baby's puke... - Right.

87
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,905
after eating a milk product.

88
00:03:55,465 --> 00:03:57,865
- Aaruul. Thank you. - Here.

89
00:03:57,865 --> 00:04:00,435
- We tasted them before. - Try some.

90
00:04:02,265 --> 00:04:04,505
(They encounter the taste of nature again.)

91
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:07,435
- Try. It's dried yogurt. - Dried yogurt.

92
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:09,465
(What will So Min think of it?)

93
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:10,605
What do you think?

94
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:12,035
It tastes like sheep.

95
00:04:12,865 --> 00:04:14,035
Maybe because it's sheep milk.

96
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,975
The shapes are all different, but the taste is the same.

97
00:04:19,305 --> 00:04:21,865
- Well, we should ask her now. - Let's ask.

98
00:04:21,865 --> 00:04:23,365
- We don't have enough time. - Right.

99
00:04:23,365 --> 00:04:24,605
Let's ask her.

100
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,975
Are you from the Borjigit tribe?

101
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:32,135
(Are they from the Borjigit tribe?)

102
00:04:32,135 --> 00:04:33,905
No.

103
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:35,435
- She's not. - I see.

104
00:04:35,435 --> 00:04:36,605
(She's not from the Borjigit tribe.)

105
00:04:36,605 --> 00:04:38,535
- I see. - She's from a different tribe.

106
00:04:39,265 --> 00:04:42,235
Do you know anyone from the tribe?

107
00:04:42,235 --> 00:04:43,505
She can't understand Korean.

108
00:04:46,905 --> 00:04:48,335
- She probably knows. - Borjigit.

109
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:49,435
Maybe there is.

110
00:04:49,435 --> 00:04:51,105
(It seems like they're nearby.)

111
00:04:51,105 --> 00:04:52,805
She says they live near here.

112
00:04:52,805 --> 00:04:55,165
(They live around here.)

113
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:56,205
Sorry.

114
00:04:56,205 --> 00:04:58,435
Is she saying we'll find their gers if we go straight?

115
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:01,975
Is it around 2km from here?

116
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:03,005
(He translates by feeling.)

117
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:05,135
Gosh, seriously.

118
00:05:05,135 --> 00:05:06,835
- 2km away from here. - Am I right?

119
00:05:07,235 --> 00:05:09,475
(It's 2km away from here.)

120
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:11,535
- Let him be the translator. - Goodness.

121
00:05:11,535 --> 00:05:13,135
(He's now going for a global host.)

122
00:05:13,305 --> 00:05:15,665
She said you might find them if we go downwards.

123
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:19,835
- See? - This is the best news yet.

124
00:05:19,835 --> 00:05:22,535
But we don't have enough time.

125
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:24,835
- Let's go then. - We need to go.

126
00:05:24,835 --> 00:05:26,905
- Thank you, ma'am. - Thank you.

127
00:05:26,905 --> 00:05:28,265
(Thank you, ma'am.)

128
00:05:28,265 --> 00:05:29,565
- Thank you. - Thank you.

129
00:05:29,565 --> 00:05:30,865
It's getting dark.

130
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:32,935
(It's 5pm, and they're about to head for another villiage.)

131
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:34,835
Will you take pictures?

132
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:38,065
- I brought a camera to take photos. - All right.

133
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,535
(Mongolian nomads like photos...)

134
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:44,465
(as gifts since it's hard for them to print pictures.)

135
00:05:46,535 --> 00:05:47,665
Look here.

136
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:54,465
(The day I showed off a little)

137
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:57,865
- Cheese. - You come here too.

138
00:05:57,905 --> 00:05:59,365
- Sit down. - Sit.

139
00:05:59,435 --> 00:06:02,035
1, 2, 3.

140
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:05,665
(5 Mongolian siblings)

141
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:08,505
- These dogs... - They're all outside.

142
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:09,805
Here.

143
00:06:10,205 --> 00:06:11,665
Here. This is you.

144
00:06:11,665 --> 00:06:13,865
(Will you remember us?)

145
00:06:13,865 --> 00:06:15,505
- Bye. - Bye.

146
00:06:16,465 --> 00:06:18,465
- The dog is in it too. - It's in it.

147
00:06:18,905 --> 00:06:20,165
But it's facing the back.

148
00:06:20,535 --> 00:06:22,005
(Give photos to nomads if you run into them.)

149
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:26,235
Can we even find a Borjigit within today?

150
00:06:26,235 --> 00:06:28,665
I don't think we'll be able to milk sheep.

151
00:06:29,835 --> 00:06:32,735
(The sun goes down in the endless plain.)

152
00:06:33,205 --> 00:06:34,765
This is really a vast plain.

153
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:37,235
(Genghis Khan must have run across this plain 1,000 years ago.)

154
00:06:37,635 --> 00:06:38,765
I'm reminded of these lyrics.

155
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:42,235
"I build a beautiful house on the green plain."

156
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,235
That looks like a movie set.

157
00:06:45,235 --> 00:06:47,565
- It's so vast. - It's like a movie set.

158
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:50,035
- Goodness. - I hope we find them here.

159
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:52,265
(At 7pm, they find another ger.)

160
00:06:52,365 --> 00:06:54,405
Look. They're there.

161
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:56,535
- We're running out of time. - Well...

162
00:06:56,535 --> 00:06:57,765
(It may be their last shot.)

163
00:06:57,765 --> 00:06:59,465
- The sun's setting. - If we can't find them here...

164
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:01,265
If the sun sets, we'll fail the mission.

165
00:07:01,265 --> 00:07:02,735
Why are they so big?

166
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:04,565
They just poop anywhere.

167
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:06,665
(Walking past the warm poops)

168
00:07:06,665 --> 00:07:09,105
- A calf is eating. - It's drinking its mother's milk.

169
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:11,805
- It's so cute. - Cute.

170
00:07:12,605 --> 00:07:14,565
(Drinking)

171
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:17,835
Look. It has a facial mask on its face.

172
00:07:18,235 --> 00:07:19,405
- Really. - My gosh.

173
00:07:19,935 --> 00:07:21,565
- Right? - It does.

174
00:07:21,565 --> 00:07:23,935
- Really. - I see dark patches under its eyes.

175
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:26,005
- It's wearing a facial mask. - A facial mask.

176
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:28,265
They're milking now.

177
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:31,005
- Where? - How do you say hello again?

178
00:07:31,005 --> 00:07:32,105
(They find a shepherd family.)

179
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:34,265
- Hello. - Hello.

180
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:36,005
(Nice to meet you.)

181
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:37,105
So cute.

182
00:07:37,105 --> 00:07:38,165
- Look at the baby. - The baby's so cute.

183
00:07:38,565 --> 00:07:39,705
(A smiling baby welcomes them.)

184
00:07:39,705 --> 00:07:40,835
It's a girl.

185
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,835
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

186
00:07:43,305 --> 00:07:44,305
Hello.

187
00:07:44,535 --> 00:07:46,805
- She's so cute. - We can't go near them.

188
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:50,905
- It's so cool. - She's so cute.

189
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:52,965
- Hello? - Hello.

190
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:55,205
- So cute. - She looks upset.

191
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:59,135
- She's shy. - Don't sit on the ground.

192
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:01,765
They're going inside.

193
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:05,035
(I'm too shy. I'm going inside.)

194
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:06,605
- No wonder. - They're milking a cow too.

195
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:08,605
All children are the same around the world.

196
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,205
It's so natural for them to sit on the ground.

197
00:08:11,205 --> 00:08:13,135
- Is that so? - Sure. All of them.

198
00:08:13,135 --> 00:08:14,705
- That red bag... - Excuse me.

199
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:16,165
Borjigit...

200
00:08:16,835 --> 00:08:19,005
- Are you from the Borjigit tribe? - Borjigit?

201
00:08:19,005 --> 00:08:23,705
(The entire family is wearing traditional clothes.)

202
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:30,335
(Can Team Ji Hyo make an end to their long journey in Mongolia?)

203
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:36,535
(Are they the descendants of Genghis Khan, the Borjigit tribe?)

204
00:08:36,535 --> 00:08:39,635
(Yes, I'm from the Borjigit tribe.)

205
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:40,835
- What? - You are?

206
00:08:40,835 --> 00:08:42,905
(Did they hear it right?)

207
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:44,205
Are you?

208
00:08:44,205 --> 00:08:45,905
- You're a Borjigit? - Borjigit?

209
00:08:45,905 --> 00:08:48,005
(He is the one they've been looking for.)

210
00:08:48,405 --> 00:08:54,135
(It's their joyful and touching journey in Mongolia.)

211
00:08:54,405 --> 00:08:55,465
- My goodness. - Borjigit.

212
00:08:55,965 --> 00:08:57,735
We've finally met them.

213
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:58,865
My goodness.

214
00:08:58,865 --> 00:09:01,035
- Awesome. - I was surprised.

215
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,635
Let's ask for their permission...

216
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:04,335
- and milk sheep. - Let's do that.

217
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,335
- All right. - I'm sorry,

218
00:09:06,665 --> 00:09:11,035
but could you let us milk about 4L from your sheep?

219
00:09:14,505 --> 00:09:15,575
It doesn't sound positive.

220
00:09:15,575 --> 00:09:18,665
- They don't sound okay with it. - 4L may be too much.

221
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:22,165
(Their long answer doesn't seem so positive.)

222
00:09:22,165 --> 00:09:23,835
They may be in some situation.

223
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:26,575
In the morning...

224
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:29,075
- They milked them already... - In the morning.

225
00:09:29,075 --> 00:09:31,365
The lambs already had the milk.

226
00:09:31,435 --> 00:09:33,635
They're not sure if you can milk that much.

227
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:35,835
- We're in trouble. - This is bad.

228
00:09:35,835 --> 00:09:37,935
(It's not good.)

229
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:40,635
(Sorry, I didn't know you were coming.)

230
00:09:40,635 --> 00:09:42,905
Will milking 4L be too hard?

231
00:09:43,235 --> 00:09:44,935
Sheep usually have small amount of milk.

232
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:49,365
The lambs have already sucked on the milk this morning.

233
00:09:49,365 --> 00:09:52,205
- It doesn't look promising. - We're in trouble.

234
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:53,965
- Usually, you can milk about... - How much?

235
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:56,005
200g of milk per sheep.

236
00:09:56,005 --> 00:09:58,665
- 200g? - 4L is too much.

237
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,635
So it means we have to milk 20 sheep.

238
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:02,335
(4L)

239
00:10:03,265 --> 00:10:05,135
(While they're all serious...)

240
00:10:05,135 --> 00:10:06,265
(Struggling)

241
00:10:06,265 --> 00:10:07,535
- This is bad. - What should we do?

242
00:10:11,365 --> 00:10:13,235
(What is this familiar feeling that we're getting from him?)

243
00:10:13,235 --> 00:10:14,705
He's wearing a Jordan t-shirt inside.

244
00:10:14,705 --> 00:10:17,435
(What is this familiar feeling that we're getting from him?)

245
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:18,765
(Ta-da)

246
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,305
You can take the entire thing off.

247
00:10:21,305 --> 00:10:24,165
Is it okay for us to milk your sheep?

248
00:10:24,705 --> 00:10:26,735
Go ahead and do that.

249
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:28,835
- Thank you. - Thank you so much.

250
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:30,705
(They need to hurry before the sun sets.)

251
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:32,765
- We need to hurry. - It's not time for dinner.

252
00:10:34,105 --> 00:10:37,305
(It's getting dark in Russia as well.)

253
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:39,505
(They've caught 6 different kinds of fish so far.)

254
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:42,575
(Pollack, flatfish, brittle star, zostera, sargassum, salpa)

255
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,665
I caught something.

256
00:10:44,105 --> 00:10:45,575
Reel in the line.

257
00:10:45,575 --> 00:10:47,205
(Even the captain seems surprised.)

258
00:10:47,205 --> 00:10:49,105
- Did you catch something? - Yes.

259
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:51,835
(Did you catch something?)

260
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:54,905
(Team Russia must catch king crabs and 10 different types of seafood.)

261
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:59,065
Oh, it's a king crab.

262
00:11:00,305 --> 00:11:01,805
- Really? - It's a king crab!

263
00:11:01,805 --> 00:11:02,965
(Did Kwang Soo really catch a king crab?)

264
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:04,205
I caught a king crab!

265
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,135
(Surprised)

266
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,605
I caught a king crab!

267
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:14,005
(Even experienced fishers don't get to catch king crabs often.)

268
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:17,265
(Did Kwang Soo really succeed?)

269
00:11:17,265 --> 00:11:18,605
Gosh, what is this?

270
00:11:19,465 --> 00:11:20,605
What is this?

271
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:23,105
It's not a king crab.

272
00:11:23,735 --> 00:11:25,765
It's a new kind.

273
00:11:26,535 --> 00:11:27,635
What is this?

274
00:11:27,635 --> 00:11:28,665
(It's not a king crab.)

275
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:30,135
It has wings.

276
00:11:30,135 --> 00:11:32,305
What's that? Is that a rockfish?

277
00:11:33,505 --> 00:11:34,865
(The fish has wings.)

278
00:11:34,865 --> 00:11:37,465
- Look at this. - Is that a monkfish?

279
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:38,565
Look at this.

280
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,235
It must be a monkfish.

281
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:42,765
The hook might break.

282
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:45,435
- We caught another kind. - It's a new kind.

283
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:46,435
(They've caught 7 types of seafood now.)

284
00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:50,765
That's a difficult one to catch.

285
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:54,235
- Look at that. - It's so aggressive.

286
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:55,335
(They now have to catch king crabs and three more types of seafood.)

287
00:11:55,335 --> 00:11:57,205
(But it's getting too dark.)

288
00:11:57,205 --> 00:12:00,105
- Let's go! - When it gets darker,

289
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:02,865
it'll be hard to go back to the port.

290
00:12:02,865 --> 00:12:05,865
Let's call it a day...

291
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:09,005
and try again tomorrow.

292
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:12,335
- Okay. - We have to go back now...

293
00:12:12,335 --> 00:12:14,265
- for safety. - You're right.

294
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:17,135
We have no choice.

295
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:19,135
(They'll try again at 5am tomorrow to complete the mission.)

296
00:12:19,135 --> 00:12:21,865
By the way, I have a question.

297
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:24,605
Does everyone have to be here tomorrow?

298
00:12:24,605 --> 00:12:27,435
(Does everyone have to be here tomorrow?)

299
00:12:27,435 --> 00:12:28,835
No, that's not necessary.

300
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:32,765
Let some of the members look around Russia.

301
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:35,535
It doesn't matter how many members go fishing.

302
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:36,535
- It doesn't? - No.

303
00:12:36,535 --> 00:12:37,635
Then...

304
00:12:38,605 --> 00:12:40,665
- Then... - Just two of us will go fishing.

305
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:42,005
- Just two of us will go fishing. - Okay.

306
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:43,605
The two highest-ranking members...

307
00:12:43,605 --> 00:12:45,665
(The exempted members from work will be No. 1 and 2.)

308
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:48,705
- Wait. - Why are you number two?

309
00:12:48,705 --> 00:12:51,565
- I caught four different kinds. - I caught so many pollacks.

310
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:53,335
I caught 4 out of 7 types.

311
00:12:53,335 --> 00:12:55,565
Everyone worked hard today.

312
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:57,605
- Who didn't work hard today? - You're right.

313
00:12:57,605 --> 00:12:59,235
- Can we play roulette? - Russian roulette?

314
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:00,665
As we're in Russia, it's Russian roulette.

315
00:13:00,665 --> 00:13:02,435
Russian roulette!

316
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,205
- Russian roulette. - Let's do it.

317
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:05,735
- Tomorrow... - Amazing.

318
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:07,135
You're not going, right?

319
00:13:07,135 --> 00:13:08,865
- I'm not going. - Come on.

320
00:13:08,865 --> 00:13:10,765
(We need our leader.)

321
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:12,565
- Just do it. - Wait.

322
00:13:13,265 --> 00:13:15,535
Jong Kook, we'll write your name in just two slots.

323
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:16,665
- Good. - Just two.

324
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:18,565
Just one.

325
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:21,005
Two will be more fun.

326
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:23,705
I think it'd be nice if you take more initiative.

327
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:25,805
As you're our boss...

328
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,035
Just two.

329
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:28,335
- Just 2. - Take just 2.

330
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:31,165
- Is it to decide who will not go? - How does it work?

331
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:32,605
- It's to decide who goes fishing. - The chosen ones will go fishing.

332
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:34,265
- The chosen ones will go fishing. - They'll go fishing.

333
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,765
- They'll go on the boat. - 1, 2, 3.

334
00:13:36,765 --> 00:13:40,435
Here we go. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

335
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:42,835
All right. Russian roulette.

336
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:46,635
6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. This is it.

337
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:51,165
Just so you know, you'll go fishing at 5am tomorrow.

338
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:53,105
(2 members have to go fishing at 5am tomorrow.)

339
00:13:53,965 --> 00:13:55,035
Haha!

340
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,205
(Haha is chosen.)

341
00:13:57,205 --> 00:13:59,965
(Haha the Pollack Catcher will go.)

342
00:14:01,535 --> 00:14:03,305
- Haha. - Haha.

343
00:14:03,765 --> 00:14:04,905
Next.

344
00:14:04,965 --> 00:14:06,835
- Here we go. - 5am.

345
00:14:07,865 --> 00:14:09,535
Thank you!

346
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:10,865
I'll turn it three times.

347
00:14:10,865 --> 00:14:12,505
Thank you!

348
00:14:12,505 --> 00:14:14,065
1, 2, 3.

349
00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:16,335
(The ranking does not matter in Russian roulette.)

350
00:14:16,335 --> 00:14:20,935
(Who will go fishing tomorrow morning?)

351
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:24,665
There you go.

352
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:26,535
(Kwang Soo is chosen.)

353
00:14:26,535 --> 00:14:27,665
There you go.

354
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:29,305
(Kwang Soo is unlucky even in Russia.)

355
00:14:29,305 --> 00:14:31,465
Oh, my.

356
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,865
- It's exactly what I predicted. - It's exactly what you predicted.

357
00:14:33,865 --> 00:14:37,705
Haha and Kwang Soo will go fishing tomorrow morning.

358
00:14:37,705 --> 00:14:39,235
(Haha and Kwang Soo have to catch king crabs.)

359
00:14:40,235 --> 00:14:43,165
(It's getting late.)

360
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:45,165
This is the perfect time to have a candid conversation.

361
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:47,465
(They make wishes.)

362
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:49,335
Make a wish.

363
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:51,735
I hope Jong Kook will always be healthy.

364
00:14:51,735 --> 00:14:53,035
(Haha is making pleasant comments for Jong Kook.)

365
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:54,435
All right. Se Chan.

366
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,265
I hope Jong Kook will recover from gout quickly.

367
00:14:57,265 --> 00:14:58,265
All right. Kwang Soo.

368
00:14:58,265 --> 00:14:59,835
I hope I won't be sent to Japan.

369
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:01,665
- What? - He's speaking to himself.

370
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:04,005
- Is that your wish? - Is it for your own sake?

371
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:05,005
For your own sake?

372
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,305
- Yes. - Whey can't we be one?

373
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,105
- It's for my own sake. - For your own sake?

374
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:11,135
- That's who you are. - See?

375
00:15:11,135 --> 00:15:13,635
You've been hiding it for a long time, right?

376
00:15:13,635 --> 00:15:15,305
To me, it seems like you're going to Japan as well.

377
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:18,705
(You think you're different? You're going to Japan as well.)

378
00:15:18,796 --> 00:15:21,156
No. I'm going to succeed tomorrow.

379
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:23,665
Only you'll be sent to Japan.

380
00:15:23,665 --> 00:15:25,665
I'll throw your king crabs back into the sea.

381
00:15:25,835 --> 00:15:28,465
I'll eat your king crabs as soon as you catch them.

382
00:15:28,465 --> 00:15:29,635
(The competition will be fierce tomorrow.)

383
00:15:29,635 --> 00:15:31,035
Jong Kook, can you say something?

384
00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:33,105
- Say something. - I really hope...

385
00:15:33,105 --> 00:15:34,835
we'll complete our mission tomorrow...

386
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:37,065
so that only one of you...

387
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:40,335
will have to go to Japan.

388
00:15:40,535 --> 00:15:42,335
It'll be so hard to choose one.

389
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,735
- That's right. - I know.

390
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:48,905
It's such a difficult decision. You guys have just one goal.

391
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:52,765
I have to choose one among you three. It's been torturing me.

392
00:15:52,765 --> 00:15:54,635
- You must be so stressed out. - Do you understand me?

393
00:15:54,635 --> 00:15:56,465
- Do you understand me? - We do.

394
00:15:56,465 --> 00:15:58,835
Right? Who is suffering the most among us?

395
00:15:58,835 --> 00:16:00,535
- You. - It's me.

396
00:16:00,665 --> 00:16:02,005
It's so difficult.

397
00:16:02,165 --> 00:16:04,835
I suffer even more watching you.

398
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:06,265
I...

399
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:08,635
It's true.

400
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,505
Just laugh instead.

401
00:16:10,505 --> 00:16:11,505
(I must cry.)

402
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:14,905
I understand how you'd be feeling.

403
00:16:14,905 --> 00:16:17,405
- You do? - Yes, it's so painful.

404
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:19,035
I'm crying for the first time...

405
00:16:19,865 --> 00:16:21,305
since the award ceremony.

406
00:16:21,305 --> 00:16:25,965
(They teased him for crying at the award ceremony.)

407
00:16:30,065 --> 00:16:31,265
Jong Kook.

408
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:34,005
I'm seriously shedding tears right now.

409
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:36,005
(I'm seriously shedding tears right now.)

410
00:16:36,805 --> 00:16:39,165
(He's shedding tears.)

411
00:16:40,335 --> 00:16:41,835
- How did you do that? - How did you do that?

412
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,635
Jong Kook, I know how you're feeling.

413
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:46,635
- I'm getting scared. - How did you do that?

414
00:16:46,635 --> 00:16:49,535
These tears are speaking for me.

415
00:16:49,535 --> 00:16:53,205
What Kwang Soo is shedding is just crocodile tears.

416
00:16:53,765 --> 00:16:55,935
- No matter how hard he tries... - Unbelievable.

417
00:16:56,735 --> 00:16:59,335
Jong Kook, I'll...

418
00:16:59,505 --> 00:17:01,605
- Jong Kook... - Se Chan.

419
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:04,105
Let me just go to Japan.

420
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:06,805
- No, I can't. - I'll just go.

421
00:17:06,805 --> 00:17:08,435
- No. - Let me go to Japan.

422
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:10,235
- Look at him. - It's been hard for you, right?

423
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:12,565
- No. - Just let me go to Japan.

424
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:13,835
It's been hard for you, right?

425
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:15,275
(All of a sudden)

426
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,735
(It's hard to watch Haha.)

427
00:17:17,735 --> 00:17:19,105
It's been so hard for you, right?

428
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:22,105
(I'm sad.)

429
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:23,905
- Look at Kwang Soo. - Look at him.

430
00:17:23,905 --> 00:17:25,335
You cry often.

431
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:27,465
Jong Kook, it's been hard for you, right?

432
00:17:27,465 --> 00:17:28,965
You guys understand me.

433
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:32,805
- Thank you! - Thank you!

434
00:17:32,805 --> 00:17:35,335
(The night in Vladivostok is filled with gratitude.)

435
00:17:35,335 --> 00:17:36,805
Thank you so much for today.

436
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:40,135
We haven't booked hotels yet.

437
00:17:40,135 --> 00:17:42,405
- Can you ask the captain? - Can you ask him?

438
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:44,605
We should find a place near here.

439
00:17:44,735 --> 00:17:47,865
Do you know any hotels around here?

440
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:54,365
(For the fishing tomorrow morning, they should find a place nearby.)

441
00:17:58,105 --> 00:17:59,905
He'll call his daughter...

442
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:02,775
so that we can stay at their summer house.

443
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:04,735
- His daughter? - Really?

444
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:06,065
Does he have a daughter?

445
00:18:06,305 --> 00:18:08,165
Thank you.

446
00:18:08,165 --> 00:18:10,635
- What should we do? - Thank you.

447
00:18:10,635 --> 00:18:13,605
- Really? - He has a daughter?

448
00:18:13,775 --> 00:18:15,135
Yes, I have a daughter.

449
00:18:15,235 --> 00:18:17,065
- Yes, he has a daughter. - How old is she?

450
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:19,305
(There he goes again.)

451
00:18:19,305 --> 00:18:22,105
- She's 24. - He says she's 24.

452
00:18:22,105 --> 00:18:25,105
Is she married?

453
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,135
- What are you doing? - No. Wait.

454
00:18:27,135 --> 00:18:29,335
- It's just that... - What are you doing?

455
00:18:29,335 --> 00:18:31,775
I want to know about her before I meet her.

456
00:18:32,605 --> 00:18:34,535
- She's not married. - He says she's not married.

457
00:18:34,535 --> 00:18:35,775
- Does she have a boyfriend? - Hey.

458
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:36,905
It's just...

459
00:18:36,905 --> 00:18:38,105
- Does she have a boyfriend? - Hey.

460
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:39,435
It's just...

461
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:41,705
- We should know about her. - Fine.

462
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:42,805
That's enough.

463
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:46,805
Tell him I'm 33. I'm not so much older than her.

464
00:18:47,535 --> 00:18:49,665
(Nervous)

465
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:52,805
Please apologize on my behalf for any mistakes I might have made.

466
00:18:52,805 --> 00:18:54,905
(Please apologize on my behalf for any mistakes I might have made.)

467
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:57,505
(With the surprise turn of events, Kwang Soo's heart is fluttering.)

468
00:18:57,505 --> 00:19:00,005
- I can't believe this. - Kwang Soo's getting excited.

469
00:19:00,865 --> 00:19:03,105
He looks nervous.

470
00:19:03,105 --> 00:19:04,665
(I failed to find king crabs, but I might find love tonight.)

471
00:19:04,665 --> 00:19:06,435
He'll soon meet her.

472
00:19:06,435 --> 00:19:08,505
(I failed to find king crabs, but I might find love tonight.)

473
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:10,705
(My Russian love,)

474
00:19:10,705 --> 00:19:12,805
(here I come.)

475
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:15,775
She's beautiful.

476
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:18,005
- Hello. - Hello.

477
00:19:18,005 --> 00:19:19,805
Come on in.

478
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:23,835
(Kwang Soo is smiling.)

479
00:19:24,905 --> 00:19:26,305
Sit here.

480
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:31,665
(Kwang Soo is tense.)

481
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,065
Can you ask her about her first impression of Kwang Soo?

482
00:19:34,065 --> 00:19:35,635
(How is her first impression of Kwang Soo?)

483
00:19:37,235 --> 00:19:40,135
She thinks you're handsome.

484
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:42,865
(Look at you.)

485
00:19:44,665 --> 00:19:46,865
- Look her in the eye. - What are you doing?

486
00:19:46,965 --> 00:19:49,005
Look her in the eye.

487
00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:51,365
(What is going on here?)

488
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:54,505
He fell in love in Russia.

489
00:19:54,805 --> 00:19:56,275
(Sighing)

490
00:19:56,435 --> 00:19:58,805
- She's... - She wants to take a picture.

491
00:19:58,805 --> 00:20:00,165
Does she want to take a picture?

492
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:01,405
(Great)

493
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:03,605
A photo with a star.

494
00:20:04,065 --> 00:20:06,805
(We Got Married)

495
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:09,505
(Friendly)

496
00:20:09,805 --> 00:20:10,935
It looks nice.

497
00:20:10,935 --> 00:20:14,065
Can you ask her about her plans for tomorrow?

498
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:17,035
I have no plans.

499
00:20:17,035 --> 00:20:18,905
She's free tomorrow.

500
00:20:19,805 --> 00:20:21,305
We have to...

501
00:20:22,605 --> 00:20:27,035
Se Chan and I have to go fishing tomorrow.

502
00:20:28,535 --> 00:20:30,905
Go fishing tomorrow.

503
00:20:31,705 --> 00:20:34,135
Me? Kwang Soo, do you want us to help you?

504
00:20:34,135 --> 00:20:35,335
Do you want us to help you?

505
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:37,275
Do you want to go on a date with her? Then I'll help you.

506
00:20:38,065 --> 00:20:41,665
- Then I'll help you. - Kwang Soo looks so happy now.

507
00:20:41,665 --> 00:20:43,335
Can she go sightseeing tomorrow with him?

508
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:46,335
I want to go to places that couples go to on a date.

509
00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:50,065
(Today, he's not a hopeless romantic.)

510
00:20:50,065 --> 00:20:52,865
(Kwang Soo will be a guy in love.)

511
00:20:53,305 --> 00:20:57,805
(It seems something might be there between Kwang Soo and her.)

512
00:20:57,805 --> 00:21:01,365
Okay, Kwang Soo. I'll help you. Don't forget I helped you. Okay?

513
00:21:01,405 --> 00:21:03,005
- Congratulations. - You must not forget about today.

514
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:07,865
(At this time, it seems the captain has something to say.)

515
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:09,775
He said there's no need for you to marry her.

516
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:14,405
(Don't even think about marrying her. He gives a warning in advance.)

517
00:21:14,405 --> 00:21:15,965
- Oh, no. - He's cool.

518
00:21:15,965 --> 00:21:17,935
(Goodness, you are so funny.)

519
00:21:18,065 --> 00:21:19,565
He said you can only go for a walk with her.

520
00:21:19,565 --> 00:21:21,305
All right. I understand.

521
00:21:21,305 --> 00:21:24,905
(Thanks to Se Chan, Kwang Soo has a date with Dasha.)

522
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:29,205
- Hello. - Hi. You're already here.

523
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,305
(It's time to go sightseeing with Dasha.)

524
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:32,035
You two should sit in the front. I'll take the back seat.

525
00:21:32,035 --> 00:21:34,205
There you go. Hey, get off first.

526
00:21:35,205 --> 00:21:36,205
Let me.

527
00:21:36,965 --> 00:21:38,005
Jong Kook.

528
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,565
(Thank you. I will make sure to return the favor.)

529
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:43,965
(Kwang Soo, good luck.)

530
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,905
(Smiling)

531
00:21:49,665 --> 00:21:50,705
Here you go, Dasha.

532
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:52,565
(He offers her juice.)

533
00:21:52,565 --> 00:21:53,565
Jong Kook, here you go.

534
00:21:53,765 --> 00:21:54,765
What is it?

535
00:21:55,305 --> 00:21:56,705
(She talks abruptly.)

536
00:21:57,135 --> 00:21:58,405
I like your sunglasses.

537
00:21:58,405 --> 00:21:59,835
- Really? - Gosh.

538
00:22:00,305 --> 00:22:01,305
Thank you.

539
00:22:02,805 --> 00:22:04,305
I have sunglasses too.

540
00:22:05,505 --> 00:22:07,035
Have you been to Korea before?

541
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,205
- Yes. - Really?

542
00:22:08,205 --> 00:22:09,605
Yes, I've been to Seoul.

543
00:22:09,605 --> 00:22:11,005
How many times have you been to Seoul?

544
00:22:11,005 --> 00:22:13,505
- Four days. - Four days? Oh, I see.

545
00:22:13,505 --> 00:22:15,105
It was a short trip.

546
00:22:15,105 --> 00:22:17,565
(He's the only one studying her responses.)

547
00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:18,805
(Dasha laughs.)

548
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:19,835
I went to clubs.

549
00:22:19,835 --> 00:22:20,965
Clubs? Great.

550
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:21,965
(He laughs too.)

551
00:22:22,665 --> 00:22:24,935
Right. It'll take about 40 minutes.

552
00:22:25,605 --> 00:22:26,705
Are you a student?

553
00:22:26,705 --> 00:22:28,405
No, I work.

554
00:22:28,405 --> 00:22:29,835
Oh, you have a job?

555
00:22:30,465 --> 00:22:33,705
(Gosh, I don't have the faintest idea what they are talking about.)

556
00:22:33,705 --> 00:22:35,835
Have you been to a lot of different countries?

557
00:22:35,835 --> 00:22:37,235
Like Korea?

558
00:22:38,465 --> 00:22:39,465
(Drinking)

559
00:22:40,765 --> 00:22:45,805
(Unintentionally, he becomes a man of few words.)

560
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:48,235
You should sit in front.

561
00:22:48,235 --> 00:22:49,305
No.

562
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:53,605
Dasha's head is about to be turned this way permanently.

563
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:56,065
(Dasha naturally looks back.)

564
00:22:56,065 --> 00:22:58,005
I think I am not the one on a date.

565
00:22:58,005 --> 00:22:59,805
- No. - Se Chan and I...

566
00:22:59,805 --> 00:23:01,305
- I just thought... - can't speak the language.

567
00:23:01,305 --> 00:23:03,305
we should keep the conversation going.

568
00:23:03,305 --> 00:23:05,465
- Okay. - Ask her questions.

569
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:08,105
(I have to get close to Dasha.)

570
00:23:08,465 --> 00:23:12,665
(They arrive at the observatory on Eagle's Nest Hill.)

571
00:23:12,665 --> 00:23:13,705
The view is great here.

572
00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:16,435
Goodness. This is pretty. It's so beautiful.

573
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:20,135
Don't you love that kind of antique buildings?

574
00:23:20,135 --> 00:23:21,235
(They start talking in English.)

575
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:23,835
Wasn't that built a long time ago? That one too.

576
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,065
- It was. - Great.

577
00:23:25,065 --> 00:23:28,935
(Next to a couple, there's a tall tourist.)

578
00:23:30,635 --> 00:23:33,165
(He pretends not to care.)

579
00:23:33,605 --> 00:23:35,705
- But the view here is spectacular. - What?

580
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,105
It's a picturesque scenery.

581
00:23:39,035 --> 00:23:42,465
(Kwang Soo, good luck.)

582
00:23:45,335 --> 00:23:50,965
(I like guys whom I can talk to more than quiet guys.)

583
00:23:50,965 --> 00:23:52,035
(Looking around)

584
00:23:53,305 --> 00:23:56,335
(Hold on. This isn't going according to my plan.)

585
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:58,235
- Really? - Yes. I see.

586
00:23:58,235 --> 00:24:01,835
There are a lot of rocks...

587
00:24:01,835 --> 00:24:03,705
on the wall and everywhere.

588
00:24:04,335 --> 00:24:07,135
They keep talking in English from the start. I don't know why.

589
00:24:07,135 --> 00:24:08,165
Kwang Soo.

590
00:24:08,335 --> 00:24:10,535
She only looks at Jong Kook.

591
00:24:10,965 --> 00:24:13,405
(Now, he has become a telephone pole.)

592
00:24:13,405 --> 00:24:15,235
- Oh, yes. You're right. - Right?

593
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:18,405
You are Russian. I thought you didn't know.

594
00:24:18,405 --> 00:24:19,905
- It's strange. - Yes.

595
00:24:20,705 --> 00:24:22,865
- Shall we go to that side? - Sure. Let's go.

596
00:24:22,865 --> 00:24:23,935
But this is...

597
00:24:25,065 --> 00:24:26,905
I didn't know this kind of place existed.

598
00:24:26,905 --> 00:24:28,665
(Kwang Soo wants to fall in love today more than ever.)

599
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:30,005
(They arrive at a maritime park.)

600
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:31,465
This is the street of the youth.

601
00:24:31,465 --> 00:24:33,905
They talk while they take a walk.

602
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:34,935
(There are many affectionate couples.)

603
00:24:34,935 --> 00:24:37,765
- Look at the boats. - This is a place for a date.

604
00:24:37,765 --> 00:24:38,935
You are right.

605
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,405
(This is my chance.)

606
00:24:40,405 --> 00:24:42,405
- Are you enjoying this? - Sorry?

607
00:24:42,405 --> 00:24:43,835
- Do you like it here? - Yes.

608
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:45,605
It doesn't smell here.

609
00:24:45,605 --> 00:24:47,265
(Sighing)

610
00:24:47,265 --> 00:24:49,435
- No? - I go to the seaside all the time.

611
00:24:49,435 --> 00:24:51,105
- Really? - Yes.

612
00:24:51,935 --> 00:24:54,405
I think the cameramen are only filming them.

613
00:24:54,405 --> 00:24:55,865
Don't forget that I am here as well.

614
00:24:56,305 --> 00:24:58,265
At least you should film me.

615
00:25:00,035 --> 00:25:01,035
(I can't give up not just yet.)

616
00:25:01,035 --> 00:25:02,735
But this is such a nice view.

617
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:07,335
Oh, I've seen this before.

618
00:25:07,335 --> 00:25:09,035
(Goodness, look at that.)

619
00:25:09,235 --> 00:25:11,705
(She can't hear Kwang Soo.)

620
00:25:11,705 --> 00:25:13,465
We are just trying to...

621
00:25:13,465 --> 00:25:16,305
- I just said something. - Oh, right.

622
00:25:16,305 --> 00:25:18,535
(He's getting angry.)

623
00:25:19,005 --> 00:25:20,805
- I've seen there before. - Do you want to ride it?

624
00:25:20,805 --> 00:25:21,835
(Can't you hear me?)

625
00:25:21,965 --> 00:25:23,705
Do you want to? Do you want to ride?

626
00:25:24,535 --> 00:25:26,605
Let's ride this. Have you ever tried this before?

627
00:25:26,605 --> 00:25:29,565
(Jong Kook and Dasha have never ridden Segway before.)

628
00:25:29,805 --> 00:25:30,805
Do you want to ride it?

629
00:25:31,135 --> 00:25:32,165
Yes, Jong Kook.

630
00:25:33,105 --> 00:25:35,905
I am going to show her what I've got.

631
00:25:35,905 --> 00:25:37,565
(All right. I'm going to show you my charm.)

632
00:25:38,465 --> 00:25:41,065
You have to put both of your feet on it. That's it.

633
00:25:41,105 --> 00:25:42,765
No, you have to lift your heel.

634
00:25:44,465 --> 00:25:47,965
(He starts showing off his charm.)

635
00:25:48,405 --> 00:25:49,605
How do you ride this?

636
00:25:49,705 --> 00:25:51,705
- Try it. Try. - You can do it.

637
00:25:51,705 --> 00:25:53,605
- Ladies first. - Come on.

638
00:25:53,605 --> 00:25:55,805
(What is Kwang Soo doing next to them?)

639
00:25:56,965 --> 00:25:58,105
What do I do?

640
00:25:58,835 --> 00:25:59,865
What should I do?

641
00:25:59,865 --> 00:26:00,865
(Dasha is busy learning how to ride it.)

642
00:26:00,865 --> 00:26:03,265
Wait. She doesn't even pay the slightest attention to me.

643
00:26:04,005 --> 00:26:05,705
- Lean forward. - What should I do?

644
00:26:05,705 --> 00:26:07,735
- Forward. Okay. - How do I stop this?

645
00:26:07,965 --> 00:26:09,065
(Everyone ignores him.)

646
00:26:09,065 --> 00:26:10,465
How do I stop this?

647
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:12,865
Turn. Turn right.

648
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:14,735
(Thanks to Kwang Soo, they are getting closer.)

649
00:26:14,735 --> 00:26:15,905
(Laughing)

650
00:26:16,865 --> 00:26:18,865
Gosh, what a pretty couple.

651
00:26:19,605 --> 00:26:20,765
Gosh, this is fun.

652
00:26:22,135 --> 00:26:26,665
(While they are filming "We Got Marred",)

653
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:28,665
- Can you turn me facing this way? - Okay.

654
00:26:28,665 --> 00:26:30,405
(he is filming "I Live Alone".)

655
00:26:30,905 --> 00:26:32,505
- Are you okay? - I'm ready.

656
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:33,965
I'm ready.

657
00:26:33,965 --> 00:26:34,965
(I know that phrase.)

658
00:26:34,965 --> 00:26:37,065
(I've been ready.)

659
00:26:37,865 --> 00:26:38,865
Kwang Soo.

660
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:40,505
This is nice.

661
00:26:41,235 --> 00:26:42,235
Good.

662
00:26:42,235 --> 00:26:43,235
(I should leave them alone.)

663
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:47,965
Perhaps, we can have a competition?

664
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:50,105
Oh, no. Not in here.

665
00:26:50,605 --> 00:26:52,705
(Kwang Soo starts filming "I Live Alone".)

666
00:26:52,705 --> 00:26:53,965
Do you want to go faster?

667
00:26:55,835 --> 00:26:56,835
What am I so slow?

668
00:26:56,835 --> 00:26:58,465
(He's frustrated.)

669
00:26:58,605 --> 00:27:01,205
(As time passes,)

670
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:03,605
(they are getting further away from Kwang Soo.)

671
00:27:03,805 --> 00:27:06,465
(I can't let this be. I should start speeding up now.)

672
00:27:08,705 --> 00:27:11,905
(Falling)

673
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,235
Kwang Soo. You fell.

674
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:17,265
What happened?

675
00:27:18,505 --> 00:27:21,665
(That's all right. It didn't look like I fell.)

676
00:27:22,665 --> 00:27:24,005
He fell.

677
00:27:24,005 --> 00:27:25,635
(Kwang Soo brings them smiles.)

678
00:27:25,635 --> 00:27:27,605
Hey, did you fall?

679
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:29,805
- No, I didn't. - Hey.

680
00:27:31,105 --> 00:27:32,835
I didn't fall.

681
00:27:32,835 --> 00:27:33,905
How?

682
00:27:34,105 --> 00:27:36,005
- How could you fall? - No, I didn't fall.

683
00:27:36,935 --> 00:27:38,235
- What? - I didn't fall.

684
00:27:38,235 --> 00:27:39,705
- You fell. - Sorry?

685
00:27:39,905 --> 00:27:41,005
- You fell. - No,

686
00:27:41,005 --> 00:27:42,735
- I didn't fall. - What are you doing?

687
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:45,605
- Sorry? - What did you do?

688
00:27:45,605 --> 00:27:47,405
- Go. Just move on. - What?

689
00:27:47,765 --> 00:27:49,135
Move on.

690
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:50,465
- You fell though. - I was admiring the view.

691
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:51,935
What is this?

692
00:27:52,305 --> 00:27:53,405
What kind of boat is it?

693
00:27:53,835 --> 00:27:56,065
- What kind of bat is it? - He drives me crazy.

694
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:58,135
Be careful. Look at your palm.

695
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,165
Let me see your hands.

696
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:00,965
- I said I didn't fall. - You...

697
00:28:00,965 --> 00:28:02,265
(He can't grab the handle.)

698
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,705
Goodness. All right. Get on it then.

699
00:28:05,335 --> 00:28:06,335
Go.

700
00:28:07,105 --> 00:28:09,265
(Staggering)

701
00:28:11,605 --> 00:28:13,335
- Go. You should go first. - Go.

702
00:28:13,335 --> 00:28:14,665
- Hurry. - Come on.

703
00:28:14,835 --> 00:28:17,605
When you push it with your heels, it moves forward.

704
00:28:17,605 --> 00:28:18,665
Push it.

705
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:20,235
I wasn't supposed to push it with my hands?

706
00:28:20,235 --> 00:28:23,005
You can do that. When you push it lightly... Kwang Soo.

707
00:28:23,565 --> 00:28:25,065
Kwang Soo.

708
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,205
- Kwang Soo. - What do I do?

709
00:28:27,235 --> 00:28:28,905
- Kwang Soo. - It's not working.

710
00:28:28,905 --> 00:28:31,065
Push it forward. Move your feet forward.

711
00:28:31,065 --> 00:28:32,065
Move your feet forward.

712
00:28:32,065 --> 00:28:33,165
(Kwang Soo moves away from them.)

713
00:28:33,165 --> 00:28:34,435
Move your feet forward.

714
00:28:37,865 --> 00:28:38,865
This is...

715
00:28:39,605 --> 00:28:42,435
sort of similar to Santa Monica in LA.

716
00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:44,405
(The street is filled with antique buildings.)

717
00:28:44,405 --> 00:28:46,065
The street is well decorated.

718
00:28:46,065 --> 00:28:47,305
It's pretty.

719
00:28:47,565 --> 00:28:50,205
Goodness, this view is so pretty. This is amazing.

720
00:28:51,135 --> 00:28:52,405
Isn't this pretty?

721
00:28:53,805 --> 00:28:56,105
- I think that must be the place. - This one?

722
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:57,705
- This is the one. - Okay.

723
00:28:57,705 --> 00:28:59,165
(They arrive at a restaurant Dasha recommended.)

724
00:29:00,665 --> 00:29:01,665
It looks delicious.

725
00:29:01,665 --> 00:29:06,965
(The authentic, Russian restaurant comforts Kwang Soo's mind and body.)

726
00:29:06,965 --> 00:29:08,865
The food is already ready? Really?

727
00:29:08,865 --> 00:29:10,165
(Our order must be out already.)

728
00:29:10,235 --> 00:29:11,805
- It's fast. - It came out really fast.

729
00:29:12,305 --> 00:29:13,665
- I see. - Is this the pancake?

730
00:29:13,665 --> 00:29:17,435
(Dasha ordered them blini which is a typical, Russian snack food.)

731
00:29:18,065 --> 00:29:20,205
It looks like a pancake. Let's try it.

732
00:29:20,205 --> 00:29:22,035
(The dough is made with mixture of buckwheat flour and flour.)

733
00:29:22,035 --> 00:29:23,235
(He takes a bite.)

734
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,865
This is delicious.

735
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:29,765
- This one is tastier. - Isn't it delicious?

736
00:29:29,765 --> 00:29:31,335
It's for you.

737
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:33,335
This one is for me.

738
00:29:33,335 --> 00:29:35,365
(Let me pay you some attention.)

739
00:29:36,335 --> 00:29:38,765
(You are making my heart race.)

740
00:29:40,665 --> 00:29:42,705
How is fishing going? Did they catch a king crab?

741
00:29:43,235 --> 00:29:45,405
If they succeed in catching a king crab,

742
00:29:46,205 --> 00:29:50,205
you should remember the memories we made today.

743
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:52,165
- It's just that... - Yes?

744
00:29:52,935 --> 00:29:54,735
I think it would greatly hurt my feelings.

745
00:29:55,065 --> 00:29:57,405
You and I spent a whole day together in Russia.

746
00:29:57,405 --> 00:29:58,805
If I had to choose only one member,

747
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:00,665
which member should it be?

748
00:30:01,235 --> 00:30:02,235
The newbie?

749
00:30:02,235 --> 00:30:05,505
(Jong Kook puts out feelers.)

750
00:30:05,505 --> 00:30:07,035
Don't you think it's only fair that he goes?

751
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:11,065
I don't know. I'm still thinking about it. I don't know what to do.

752
00:30:12,765 --> 00:30:16,235
I thought that if there were sheep, milking them wouldn't be a problem.

753
00:30:16,235 --> 00:30:20,405
Nomads go to bed around 9pm.

754
00:30:20,405 --> 00:30:21,505
Okay. So what?

755
00:30:21,505 --> 00:30:25,435
- Right now, it's 7:45pm. - Right.

756
00:30:25,465 --> 00:30:27,335
- You have to finish before 9pm. - We can only milk them until 9pm?

757
00:30:27,335 --> 00:30:29,105
- Yes. - Are you serious?

758
00:30:29,105 --> 00:30:31,705
Things are different from what we expected.

759
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:32,705
- I'm sorry, but... - I was...

760
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,905
- just informed as well. - There's no milk left though.

761
00:30:34,905 --> 00:30:37,365
- There is no milk left. - They were out with their babies.

762
00:30:37,365 --> 00:30:39,005
- This is too much. - Think about it.

763
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:41,465
They would care more about their babies than us.

764
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:44,065
In that case, we will bring down the amount to 2L.

765
00:30:44,065 --> 00:30:45,705
- 2L? Please do that. - Please do that.

766
00:30:45,705 --> 00:30:49,205
Admit your failure if you don't get 2L of milk before 9pm.

767
00:30:49,205 --> 00:30:52,105
- Let's go. - We can't see after sunset.

768
00:30:52,105 --> 00:30:53,635
- Let's do this in an hour. - We need to go.

769
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:55,365
This is a disaster.

770
00:30:55,365 --> 00:30:56,535
- This is a disaster. - I know.

771
00:30:56,535 --> 00:30:58,635
There is no milk.

772
00:30:59,765 --> 00:31:02,705
- Sheep are next to the goats. - There are here.

773
00:31:02,705 --> 00:31:05,005
- How cute! - My goodness.

774
00:31:05,005 --> 00:31:07,565
- They look like Oreos, Ji Hyo. - They are next to the goats.

775
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:08,765
Look at them.

776
00:31:08,765 --> 00:31:09,865
How fascinating!

777
00:31:09,865 --> 00:31:11,065
My goodness.

778
00:31:11,065 --> 00:31:13,235
- Will we be able to milk them? - How fascinating!

779
00:31:13,235 --> 00:31:15,565
- I don't know if I can do it. - They are scary.

780
00:31:15,635 --> 00:31:18,465
- How cute! - Which ones are females?

781
00:31:19,105 --> 00:31:22,065
I can't differentiate them, let alone milk them.

782
00:31:22,065 --> 00:31:23,865
That baby isn't scared of them.

783
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:25,305
- That baby isn't scared of them. - The sheep are running away.

784
00:31:25,305 --> 00:31:27,705
They are running away. They must find us scary.

785
00:31:27,705 --> 00:31:29,135
(Let's play together.)

786
00:31:29,735 --> 00:31:32,305
- They find the baby scary. - Are you okay?

787
00:31:32,535 --> 00:31:33,965
Baby.

788
00:31:34,135 --> 00:31:35,305
Are you okay?

789
00:31:35,305 --> 00:31:36,705
She didn't even bat an eye.

790
00:31:36,705 --> 00:31:37,905
I can't believe it.

791
00:31:37,905 --> 00:31:40,635
- They won't stand next to her. - Seriously.

792
00:31:41,805 --> 00:31:43,435
- The sheep avoid the baby. - It's fascinating.

793
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,535
They are looking for a lamb...

794
00:31:45,535 --> 00:31:48,335
because sheep only give milk when their babies suck.

795
00:31:48,465 --> 00:31:49,935
How can you expect us to do this task?

796
00:31:49,935 --> 00:31:51,565
That's why they are looking for a lamb.

797
00:31:51,565 --> 00:31:52,705
They found it.

798
00:31:52,705 --> 00:31:54,765
- It's fascinating. - It's sucking.

799
00:31:54,765 --> 00:31:56,065
(We thought we could simply milk the sheep.)

800
00:31:56,065 --> 00:31:57,265
We can't do this.

801
00:31:57,265 --> 00:31:58,865
- We can't do this. - It's impossible.

802
00:31:58,865 --> 00:32:00,205
You jerk.

803
00:32:00,505 --> 00:32:02,605
- It's an impossible mission. - Give us something we can do.

804
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:05,335
You should give us a mission we can complete in Mongolia.

805
00:32:05,335 --> 00:32:06,765
This is ridiculous.

806
00:32:06,965 --> 00:32:08,735
It's coming out.

807
00:32:10,035 --> 00:32:11,235
That's not a lot.

808
00:32:11,235 --> 00:32:12,465
(Milk comes out after a lamb sucks.)

809
00:32:12,465 --> 00:32:14,835
Milk only comes out after a lamb sucks.

810
00:32:14,835 --> 00:32:16,065
That's right.

811
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,035
(Is that all?)

812
00:32:19,035 --> 00:32:20,665
- That's not a lot. - There is no milk.

813
00:32:21,405 --> 00:32:23,165
- That's not a lot. - There is no milk.

814
00:32:23,535 --> 00:32:24,635
For goodness' sake.

815
00:32:24,635 --> 00:32:27,365
- Even an expert got a small amount. - Look at that.

816
00:32:28,265 --> 00:32:29,735
- Look at this. - It's a small amount.

817
00:32:29,735 --> 00:32:32,735
She got this much from four sheep.

818
00:32:32,865 --> 00:32:35,765
- This is too much. - This is an impossible task.

819
00:32:36,135 --> 00:32:38,035
Even if we milk 300 sheep, it won't be enough.

820
00:32:38,035 --> 00:32:39,235
Then I will bring down the amount to 1L.

821
00:32:39,235 --> 00:32:40,535
- 1L? - Get 1L before 9pm.

822
00:32:41,035 --> 00:32:42,265
Fill this container.

823
00:32:42,935 --> 00:32:45,435
- This is impossible. - I can't compromise further.

824
00:32:45,435 --> 00:32:46,565
(They must get 1L of milk.)

825
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:47,905
In that case,

826
00:32:48,165 --> 00:32:50,705
let's take turns in milking the sheep.

827
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,205
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

828
00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:53,605
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

829
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:56,005
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo have scissors, and Seok Jin and So Min have paper.)

830
00:32:57,165 --> 00:32:58,665
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo lose.)

831
00:32:58,665 --> 00:33:00,805
- We will take turns anyway. - You are right.

832
00:33:00,805 --> 00:33:01,905
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

833
00:33:01,905 --> 00:33:03,835
(Jae Seok has scissors, and Ji Hyo has paper.)

834
00:33:05,405 --> 00:33:06,965
- Get a lot of milk. - Okay.

835
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:08,505
Get a lot of milk.

836
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:12,335
I don't know if we will succeed.

837
00:33:12,405 --> 00:33:14,035
It's impossible.

838
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:16,305
(It seems like an impossible mission.)

839
00:33:16,435 --> 00:33:18,035
- Sheep. - She is catching one.

840
00:33:18,035 --> 00:33:20,165
- Sheep. - She is catching one.

841
00:33:20,335 --> 00:33:21,735
Get to work.

842
00:33:21,805 --> 00:33:23,135
The sun is setting.

843
00:33:23,565 --> 00:33:25,335
- Sir, what should I do? - This is a disaster.

844
00:33:26,865 --> 00:33:29,405
I will put this in the back.

845
00:33:30,235 --> 00:33:32,765
(She starts to milk the sheep without hesitation.)

846
00:33:32,765 --> 00:33:34,965
Thank goodness other sheep aren't coming near.

847
00:33:35,205 --> 00:33:36,805
You're right.

848
00:33:37,835 --> 00:33:41,205
I need to squeeze its udders with force.

849
00:33:41,205 --> 00:33:43,465
(Crying)

850
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:50,305
(She lacks time and experience. Will she succeed in milking?)

851
00:33:50,735 --> 00:33:52,535
- Milk is coming out. - Really?

852
00:33:52,535 --> 00:33:54,765
(Milk is coming out.)

853
00:33:55,065 --> 00:33:56,235
Is it a lot?

854
00:33:56,865 --> 00:33:58,235
Milk is coming out.

855
00:33:58,235 --> 00:33:59,705
Really? Is it a lot?

856
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:02,535
- The sun is setting. - We might be able to do this.

857
00:34:02,535 --> 00:34:03,935
We might be able to do this.

858
00:34:03,935 --> 00:34:06,035
(Will we avoid going to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear?)

859
00:34:06,035 --> 00:34:07,235
I am scared.

860
00:34:08,105 --> 00:34:11,905
(You can do this, Ji Hyo.)

861
00:34:13,175 --> 00:34:17,675
(They came to the grassland for milk.)

862
00:34:17,675 --> 00:34:19,865
(Ji Hyo makes leaps in the task.)

863
00:34:19,865 --> 00:34:21,605
- Is it coming out well? - Yes.

864
00:34:21,605 --> 00:34:23,465
- How much do you have? - Right now...

865
00:34:24,465 --> 00:34:25,565
Let's see it.

866
00:34:25,865 --> 00:34:27,175
How much do you have? Let's see it.

867
00:34:28,135 --> 00:34:29,535
You need to squeeze hard.

868
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:30,675
Do you need to put force into it?

869
00:34:30,675 --> 00:34:32,565
- You got a lot of milk. - You got a lot of milk.

870
00:34:32,735 --> 00:34:34,535
We might be able to do this.

871
00:34:35,265 --> 00:34:36,635
- Go in. - I will go in now.

872
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,765
My goodness, I am not good with something like this.

873
00:34:40,405 --> 00:34:41,935
It looks like they are playing a leap frog game.

874
00:34:43,035 --> 00:34:44,305
Let's go over there.

875
00:34:44,675 --> 00:34:45,935
It won't kick me, will it?

876
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:48,805
I must squeeze hard.

877
00:34:49,405 --> 00:34:50,835
I am sorry, guys.

878
00:34:51,035 --> 00:34:53,765
Listen. We will leave after we get 1L of your milk.

879
00:34:54,405 --> 00:34:55,935
I am sorry.

880
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:58,365
I am sorry. Stay still.

881
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,335
Where are they?

882
00:35:02,335 --> 00:35:03,675
(I can't look.)

883
00:35:03,675 --> 00:35:04,935
Where are they?

884
00:35:05,805 --> 00:35:07,835
- Jae Seok, - Find them on your own.

885
00:35:07,835 --> 00:35:09,505
put your hands in like this.

886
00:35:10,205 --> 00:35:11,505
You need to squeeze...

887
00:35:11,505 --> 00:35:14,365
- like this. - Like this?

888
00:35:14,365 --> 00:35:15,675
Put your hands in like this.

889
00:35:16,105 --> 00:35:18,135
Jae Seok, you will get the hang of it.

890
00:35:21,605 --> 00:35:23,465
(My goodness.)

891
00:35:23,465 --> 00:35:27,675
- I know how it feels. - I know how it feels too.

892
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:29,535
- Squeeze like this. - I can't do this.

893
00:35:29,535 --> 00:35:32,305
- Jae Seok. - I know how it feels.

894
00:35:32,565 --> 00:35:35,005
- I don't think I can do this. - Jae Seok, hurry up.

895
00:35:35,005 --> 00:35:37,365
Do you want to go to Japan?

896
00:35:37,465 --> 00:35:38,765
We don't have much time.

897
00:35:39,235 --> 00:35:41,435
- Hurry up. We don't have much time. - I don't think I can do this.

898
00:35:41,435 --> 00:35:42,565
- Hurry up. - We don't have much time.

899
00:35:42,565 --> 00:35:43,705
They are too warm.

900
00:35:44,005 --> 00:35:46,435
Squeeze like this.

901
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,965
(My goodness.)

902
00:35:47,965 --> 00:35:49,265
(I really can't do this.)

903
00:35:49,265 --> 00:35:51,335
- Milk won't come out. - Let me try.

904
00:35:51,705 --> 00:35:52,765
- For goodness' sake. - Ji Hyo.

905
00:35:52,765 --> 00:35:54,835
- Ji Hyo, you should do it. - I don't think I can do this.

906
00:35:54,835 --> 00:35:56,365
(Ji Hyo, please do it for me.)

907
00:35:56,365 --> 00:35:57,735
- Is it coming out? - No, it's not.

908
00:35:57,735 --> 00:35:59,035
I guess it's not coming out.

909
00:35:59,805 --> 00:36:01,675
(It's too bad that milk isn't coming out.)

910
00:36:02,935 --> 00:36:04,005
It's not coming out.

911
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:09,335
- My goodness. - They came out.

912
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:11,335
(The sheep attempt to escape.)

913
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,565
What should we do?

914
00:36:12,765 --> 00:36:14,935
They escaped. What should we do?

915
00:36:14,935 --> 00:36:16,365
They came out.

916
00:36:16,365 --> 00:36:17,765
- They are running away. - What should we do?

917
00:36:18,035 --> 00:36:20,505
Gosh, I can't believe them.

918
00:36:20,675 --> 00:36:22,105
Don't run away.

919
00:36:22,675 --> 00:36:23,735
Don't run away.

920
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:26,305
For goodness' sake.

921
00:36:27,405 --> 00:36:29,865
- Don't run away. - Hey, hey, hey.

922
00:36:29,865 --> 00:36:31,065
They are running away further.

923
00:36:31,065 --> 00:36:32,865
- Move that way. - This is a disaster.

924
00:36:33,535 --> 00:36:35,435
- All right. - Move that way.

925
00:36:35,435 --> 00:36:37,205
(Let's use tactic 1 to chase the sheep.)

926
00:36:38,065 --> 00:36:39,335
Go back into the fence.

927
00:36:39,705 --> 00:36:41,235
- Go that way. - Go back into the fence.

928
00:36:41,235 --> 00:36:42,405
Run towards them.

929
00:36:42,405 --> 00:36:43,705
- My goodness. - That's not the right direction.

930
00:36:43,705 --> 00:36:45,065
(We refuse to be caught.)

931
00:36:45,065 --> 00:36:46,565
Don't go that way.

932
00:36:47,735 --> 00:36:50,505
(Come back, sheep.)

933
00:36:50,505 --> 00:36:51,675
This is a disaster.

934
00:36:52,265 --> 00:36:54,105
(While the sheep are moving further away...)

935
00:36:54,105 --> 00:36:55,705
- This is a disaster. - Where are they?

936
00:36:58,405 --> 00:36:59,705
(The sun sets, and the mission continues.)

937
00:36:59,705 --> 00:37:00,805
Okay, okay.

938
00:37:00,805 --> 00:37:02,935
(The sun sets, and the mission continues.)

939
00:37:05,305 --> 00:37:08,505
(Let me give you this instead of milk.)

940
00:37:10,235 --> 00:37:11,835
(Laughing)

941
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:17,765
(It looks like the sheep exerted too much force.)

942
00:37:18,335 --> 00:37:19,605
My goodness.

943
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:22,135
It pooped.

944
00:37:22,135 --> 00:37:24,965
(She now has something she doesn't need.)

945
00:37:25,565 --> 00:37:29,065
Give me milk, give me milk

946
00:37:29,735 --> 00:37:31,805
Come here.

947
00:37:31,805 --> 00:37:33,005
(It sounds like a spell for milk.)

948
00:37:33,005 --> 00:37:34,175
I just need one.

949
00:37:35,035 --> 00:37:36,205
Please.

950
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,175
Give me milk, give me milk

951
00:37:38,605 --> 00:37:40,175
There is no milk.

952
00:37:40,335 --> 00:37:41,405
The clock is ticking.

953
00:37:41,405 --> 00:37:43,335
You liar! There is no milk.

954
00:37:43,565 --> 00:37:45,065
These sheep don't have milk.

955
00:37:45,405 --> 00:37:47,365
This is "The Silence of the Lambs".

956
00:37:47,705 --> 00:37:52,565
These sheep don't have milk.

957
00:37:52,565 --> 00:37:55,005
We should have come in the morning. This is ridiculous.

958
00:37:55,535 --> 00:37:58,175
- I didn't expect this. - These sheep don't have milk.

959
00:37:59,805 --> 00:38:01,105
Milk isn't coming out.

960
00:38:01,105 --> 00:38:04,675
(No matter how hard she squeezes, milk doesn't come out.)

961
00:38:04,675 --> 00:38:05,835
There is no milk.

962
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:07,765
Is milk coming out?

963
00:38:09,505 --> 00:38:11,305
(Dripping)

964
00:38:12,105 --> 00:38:13,435
This is bad.

965
00:38:13,935 --> 00:38:16,335
- This is impossible. - The sun is setting. This is bad.

966
00:38:16,535 --> 00:38:17,865
I thought...

967
00:38:18,405 --> 00:38:21,465
milking sheep would be easy once we find the nomads.

968
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,235
This is driving me crazy.

969
00:38:23,235 --> 00:38:24,335
(It's an unexpected hardship.)

970
00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:26,865
What should we do? What time is it right now?

971
00:38:26,865 --> 00:38:30,265
- It's 8:20pm. - 8:20pm?

972
00:38:30,365 --> 00:38:32,705
The sheep go to sleep at 8:30pm.

973
00:38:32,705 --> 00:38:34,965
The nomads will leave for dinner.

974
00:38:34,965 --> 00:38:36,265
(The Borjigit couple will leave for dinner at 8:30pm.)

975
00:38:37,435 --> 00:38:39,065
There is no milk.

976
00:38:39,065 --> 00:38:40,865
(She approaches them carefully. Is something the matter?)

977
00:38:40,865 --> 00:38:42,035
What?

978
00:38:42,365 --> 00:38:43,605
We need a translator.

979
00:38:43,605 --> 00:38:49,105
(What is the message she relayed?)

980
00:38:49,105 --> 00:38:52,265
She is suggesting that you have dinner with them.

981
00:38:52,805 --> 00:38:54,305
Ma'am...

982
00:38:54,705 --> 00:38:56,065
She is suggesting that you have dinner.

983
00:38:56,065 --> 00:38:58,235
I know. She is suggesting that we have dinner instead.

984
00:38:58,335 --> 00:38:59,965
That means we will go to the Labyrinth.

985
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:01,135
(When you think it's late, the truth is, it's really late.)

986
00:39:01,135 --> 00:39:02,235
My goodness.

987
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:04,675
- We really need milk. - We can't give up.

988
00:39:04,805 --> 00:39:07,435
We really need milk.

989
00:39:07,435 --> 00:39:08,865
It was a struggle to come to Mongolia.

990
00:39:09,205 --> 00:39:13,435
We should have come here earlier.

991
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:16,205
- Everyone. - Come on, staff.

992
00:39:16,205 --> 00:39:19,365
- You threw shoes upon your arrival. - Right.

993
00:39:19,365 --> 00:39:21,505
- You got this mission. - Right.

994
00:39:22,065 --> 00:39:23,905
- Right? - Right.

995
00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:27,205
We went to a Korean restaurant as you wanted.

996
00:39:27,305 --> 00:39:30,635
It's an impossible mission since there is no milk.

997
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:32,705
There is no milk. It ran out.

998
00:39:32,865 --> 00:39:34,175
Seriously.

999
00:39:34,435 --> 00:39:35,565
Wait a minute.

1000
00:39:35,565 --> 00:39:37,175
You should bring back...

1001
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:40,405
the four sheep before the sun sets.

1002
00:39:40,405 --> 00:39:43,505
I know what they look like.

1003
00:39:43,535 --> 00:39:47,105
I asked them earlier.

1004
00:39:47,605 --> 00:39:51,565
The locals can recognize their sheep and find them later.

1005
00:39:51,905 --> 00:39:53,535
I talked to them.

1006
00:39:53,535 --> 00:39:55,735
We reduced the amount from 4L to 2L.

1007
00:39:55,735 --> 00:39:59,105
You only got an incredibly small amount of milk.

1008
00:39:59,435 --> 00:40:01,265
The current time is 8:30pm.

1009
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:03,235
You failed the mission.

1010
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:06,135
(They fail the mission of milking sheep.)

1011
00:40:06,865 --> 00:40:08,035
Also...

1012
00:40:09,205 --> 00:40:11,865
The sheep are coming out.

1013
00:40:12,705 --> 00:40:13,835
What is going on?

1014
00:40:13,835 --> 00:40:15,265
They must be moving for dinner.

1015
00:40:15,465 --> 00:40:17,005
It's time for them to come out.

1016
00:40:17,675 --> 00:40:19,865
The other four sheep will join them.

1017
00:40:19,865 --> 00:40:21,135
(It's dinnertime for the sheep.)

1018
00:40:21,135 --> 00:40:22,335
They are looking for the four sheep.

1019
00:40:22,335 --> 00:40:24,065
They must be looking for the lost four.

1020
00:40:24,065 --> 00:40:26,405
(We will eat well and replenish our milk.)

1021
00:40:26,405 --> 00:40:27,435
They are really fast.

1022
00:40:30,205 --> 00:40:31,365
There is one.

1023
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:32,535
Come here.

1024
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,305
You might have some milk.

1025
00:40:34,835 --> 00:40:36,505
You might have some milk.

1026
00:40:36,505 --> 00:40:38,105
(Scared)

1027
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:40,765
- Just in case. - You're going too far.

1028
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:43,905
Who knows? It might have much milk.

1029
00:40:43,905 --> 00:40:44,965
If you come out...

1030
00:40:44,965 --> 00:40:47,175
- Look. - Look at it.

1031
00:40:47,265 --> 00:40:48,865
- What's wrong with her? - She's running away.

1032
00:40:48,865 --> 00:40:50,805
- It might... - If you come out...

1033
00:40:50,805 --> 00:40:52,835
- Look. - Look at it.

1034
00:40:53,565 --> 00:40:56,205
(She runs away before she gets caught.)

1035
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:57,805
- What's wrong with her? - She's running away.

1036
00:40:57,805 --> 00:40:59,535
Maybe she heard you.

1037
00:40:59,535 --> 00:41:00,675
I'm sorry.

1038
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:02,465
(They fail the mission by sending away the last sheep.)

1039
00:41:02,465 --> 00:41:04,305
- Gosh. - Thank you for the meal.

1040
00:41:04,305 --> 00:41:05,565
Wow, look at this.

1041
00:41:05,565 --> 00:41:07,405
(They're excited to have a Mongolian traditional dinner.)

1042
00:41:07,405 --> 00:41:08,505
- Are they sweet potatoes? - Just potatoes.

1043
00:41:08,505 --> 00:41:10,565
This must be it. Is this sheep meat?

1044
00:41:10,565 --> 00:41:12,235
That's sheep.

1045
00:41:12,235 --> 00:41:14,005
(Horhog: Sheep meat and vegetables are steamed with heated rocks.)

1046
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:15,735
This must be the soup.

1047
00:41:15,735 --> 00:41:17,765
(It's the broth which is made from steaming the horhog.)

1048
00:41:18,305 --> 00:41:19,405
The meat.

1049
00:41:19,405 --> 00:41:23,035
(They finally get to taste the sheep meat.)

1050
00:41:23,035 --> 00:41:25,175
- How is it? - It's delicious.

1051
00:41:25,175 --> 00:41:27,005
- It's really good. - Join us.

1052
00:41:27,005 --> 00:41:29,305
- Is it good? - It's really good. Try.

1053
00:41:29,305 --> 00:41:31,805
- Isn't it because you like lambs? - No, it's really delicious.

1054
00:41:32,435 --> 00:41:35,205
They recommended having the meat with this sauce.

1055
00:41:35,905 --> 00:41:38,035
It's onions with salt.

1056
00:41:38,035 --> 00:41:39,735
It's like a sauce.

1057
00:41:39,835 --> 00:41:41,705
- Okay, I'll try. - Try it.

1058
00:41:45,065 --> 00:41:46,065
What is it?

1059
00:41:46,065 --> 00:41:47,805
(His small eyes open wide.)

1060
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,605
- Try it. - It's amazing.

1061
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:51,105
How should I eat it?

1062
00:41:51,105 --> 00:41:52,675
- Don't you think so? - It's good.

1063
00:41:52,675 --> 00:41:54,865
- It doesn't smell bad at all. - It tastes similar to what I had...

1064
00:41:54,865 --> 00:41:59,105
- while filming a traveling TV show. - It smells just a little bit.

1065
00:41:59,905 --> 00:42:02,535
- It doesn't smell bad. - I don't smell any odor.

1066
00:42:02,535 --> 00:42:04,935
I don't want to exaggerate, but it's really good.

1067
00:42:04,935 --> 00:42:06,365
- It's really good. - Thank you.

1068
00:42:06,365 --> 00:42:10,565
(The generous Borjigit father offers enough food...)

1069
00:42:10,565 --> 00:42:12,605
- It's really good. - Right?

1070
00:42:12,605 --> 00:42:13,805
(for the staff members too.)

1071
00:42:13,805 --> 00:42:15,835
- Try this. - My goodness.

1072
00:42:16,765 --> 00:42:18,465
The meat is so good.

1073
00:42:19,765 --> 00:42:21,865
(Everyone enjoys the dinner thanks to his kindness.)

1074
00:42:21,865 --> 00:42:24,335
- It'd be great if we had kimchi. - Right.

1075
00:42:24,335 --> 00:42:25,435
- So good. - I'm surprised.

1076
00:42:25,435 --> 00:42:26,735
- Isn't it good? - Yes.

1077
00:42:26,735 --> 00:42:28,605
- They cut the meat. - Kwon Ryeol.

1078
00:42:28,605 --> 00:42:30,135
Shouldn't you hold your camera?

1079
00:42:30,135 --> 00:42:31,535
Kwon Ryeol, Shouldn't you hold your camera?

1080
00:42:32,105 --> 00:42:34,265
(The night in Mongolia darkens with the warm dinner.)

1081
00:42:34,265 --> 00:42:35,675
I was too busy eating.

1082
00:42:37,005 --> 00:42:38,635
I don't think I can go.

1083
00:42:38,675 --> 00:42:39,905
(Today at dawn in Russia)

1084
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:43,205
I'm so burdened now.

1085
00:42:43,705 --> 00:42:45,175
It's the night of fishermen.

1086
00:42:45,175 --> 00:42:46,265
(Haha and Se Chan prepare to go fishing.)

1087
00:42:46,265 --> 00:42:47,965
We don't know if we can catch any fish.

1088
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:48,965
(Burdensome)

1089
00:42:50,405 --> 00:42:53,765
(With a determined mind to catch a king crab)

1090
00:42:53,765 --> 00:42:55,865
- I feel... - Yes?

1091
00:42:56,965 --> 00:42:59,135
Honestly, I have a good feeling today.

1092
00:42:59,805 --> 00:43:01,505
I hope we're lucky today.

1093
00:43:01,505 --> 00:43:03,175
It's the end of us if we can't...

1094
00:43:03,175 --> 00:43:04,805
- catch it at this early hour. - The end?

1095
00:43:05,865 --> 00:43:07,175
It'll be the same as yesterday then.

1096
00:43:07,175 --> 00:43:10,205
We'll have to buy tickets to Japan and fly over from here.

1097
00:43:11,335 --> 00:43:13,365
And Jong Kook, that punk...

1098
00:43:13,735 --> 00:43:15,765
- Don't get upset. - Why did he pick this mission?

1099
00:43:15,765 --> 00:43:19,805
Only if he had picked the pollack... I caught so many of them yesterday.

1100
00:43:20,105 --> 00:43:21,605
We can't do anything about it.

1101
00:43:22,205 --> 00:43:23,765
He thinks he can do anything he wants.

1102
00:43:23,765 --> 00:43:24,835
(They blame their leader.)

1103
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:26,205
Why did he come here in the first place?

1104
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:28,135
Even my senior comedians don't go that far.

1105
00:43:28,135 --> 00:43:30,735
- Right? - He's too strict.

1106
00:43:30,735 --> 00:43:33,235
Even the athletes don't go this far.

1107
00:43:33,565 --> 00:43:35,705
Their coaches don't discipline them like this.

1108
00:43:36,305 --> 00:43:40,705
We call it a team when the members support each other.

1109
00:43:41,965 --> 00:43:45,835
Let's teach him a lesson one day when we have a chance.

1110
00:43:46,705 --> 00:43:48,565
He must learn how scary the world is.

1111
00:43:49,805 --> 00:43:50,965
He's...

1112
00:43:51,205 --> 00:43:52,565
How should I put it?

1113
00:43:53,035 --> 00:43:54,435
(He thinks he's the only one existing in the world.)

1114
00:43:54,435 --> 00:43:56,305
- He thinks he's the only one. - Yes, in the world.

1115
00:43:57,935 --> 00:43:59,365
I'm so tired.

1116
00:43:59,365 --> 00:44:01,105
(He becomes tired after thinking shortly.)

1117
00:44:03,005 --> 00:44:04,135
(With their tired bodies,)

1118
00:44:04,135 --> 00:44:05,265
Get off.

1119
00:44:05,905 --> 00:44:08,305
I hope we get lucky today.

1120
00:44:08,305 --> 00:44:10,665
- We have to fish no matter what. - We have to catch.

1121
00:44:11,305 --> 00:44:14,405
(They have 3 kinds of fish and a king crab left to catch.)

1122
00:44:14,405 --> 00:44:16,535
(Will they catch them all and clear the mission?)

1123
00:44:16,535 --> 00:44:17,965
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1124
00:44:18,605 --> 00:44:22,235
(They depart with a determination.)

1125
00:44:22,235 --> 00:44:24,865
Do you remember the chance card...

1126
00:44:24,865 --> 00:44:27,705
Team Ji Hyo acquired last week?

1127
00:44:27,705 --> 00:44:28,805
(Chance Card?)

1128
00:44:30,005 --> 00:44:34,005
(Team Ji Hyo acquired a Chance Card during their previous mission.)

1129
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:37,265
(It turned out to be the right to delete a fish type from the list.)

1130
00:44:37,265 --> 00:44:40,035
(They deleted flatfish from the list to hinder Team Jong Kook.)

1131
00:44:40,705 --> 00:44:42,205
- They deleted flatfish. - Okay.

1132
00:44:42,205 --> 00:44:44,365
- That's not a big deal. - It's not crucial.

1133
00:44:44,635 --> 00:44:45,665
We've got plenty.

1134
00:44:45,665 --> 00:44:49,535
I caught pollack and flatfish at once with one throw yesterday.

1135
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:52,565
We let the baby flatfish go yesterday.

1136
00:44:52,705 --> 00:44:54,505
Flatfish is nothing.

1137
00:44:54,535 --> 00:44:56,065
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1138
00:44:56,835 --> 00:44:59,565
- Let's eat king crab noodles today. - Sure!

1139
00:44:59,565 --> 00:45:00,705
(They're determined to catch one.)

1140
00:45:00,705 --> 00:45:05,065
Just one. Just one is enough for us.

1141
00:45:06,065 --> 00:45:07,235
(Nothing matters as long as it's a king crab.)

1142
00:45:07,235 --> 00:45:09,235
I'd like just one king crab.

1143
00:45:11,265 --> 00:45:13,905
(Focusing entirely on his finger)

1144
00:45:13,905 --> 00:45:16,235
Okay, I caught one.

1145
00:45:16,335 --> 00:45:17,465
(Se Chan catches one from the start.)

1146
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,035
Let it be flatfish.

1147
00:45:19,305 --> 00:45:20,305
Did I lose it?

1148
00:45:20,305 --> 00:45:22,835
(What will be their first catch?)

1149
00:45:23,065 --> 00:45:24,605
My gosh! Look!

1150
00:45:24,605 --> 00:45:26,235
What are they?

1151
00:45:26,235 --> 00:45:29,135
(He catches two big fish.)

1152
00:45:29,135 --> 00:45:31,435
- What is this? - It's monkfish.

1153
00:45:31,435 --> 00:45:33,065
(It's ganko and flatfish which have been deleted from their list.)

1154
00:45:33,165 --> 00:45:34,905
Congratulations!

1155
00:45:34,905 --> 00:45:36,435
(It's ganko and flatfish which have been deleted from their list.)

1156
00:45:36,435 --> 00:45:38,265
- It's halibut! - Yes!

1157
00:45:38,265 --> 00:45:39,405
Awesome!

1158
00:45:39,405 --> 00:45:40,665
(Haha catches halibut.)

1159
00:45:40,665 --> 00:45:44,305
(He's the real fisherman.)

1160
00:45:45,235 --> 00:45:46,765
- Haha. - What?

1161
00:45:46,765 --> 00:45:48,365
What is this?

1162
00:45:48,905 --> 00:45:50,635
(Did you catch something again, my friend?)

1163
00:45:50,635 --> 00:45:51,935
Its color is weird.

1164
00:45:51,935 --> 00:45:53,535
(He catches something with an unfamiliar pattern.)

1165
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,205
What is this?

1166
00:45:55,205 --> 00:45:56,935
Isn't this bream?

1167
00:45:57,365 --> 00:45:59,765
- What is this? - Isn't this bream?

1168
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:02,065
- What is this? - It has striped patterns.

1169
00:46:03,205 --> 00:46:05,535
(It looks similar to flatfish, but has a different pattern.)

1170
00:46:05,535 --> 00:46:07,565
- We caught all 10 kinds of fish. - What is this?

1171
00:46:07,805 --> 00:46:09,635
It's different from flatfish.

1172
00:46:09,635 --> 00:46:11,265
What is that?

1173
00:46:11,265 --> 00:46:13,235
- Is it a different kind? - Yes, it's different.

1174
00:46:13,235 --> 00:46:15,935
(- Is it a different kind? - Yes, it's different.)

1175
00:46:16,335 --> 00:46:18,905
You did it, Se Chan!

1176
00:46:19,205 --> 00:46:21,705
(Se Chan succeeds to catch the 10th kind of fish.)

1177
00:46:21,705 --> 00:46:24,605
We accept it as the 10th kind.

1178
00:46:24,605 --> 00:46:27,765
(It's accepted as the 10th kind.)

1179
00:46:27,765 --> 00:46:30,465
(They succeed in catching 10 kinds of fish.)

1180
00:46:30,805 --> 00:46:32,705
- We're awesome. - Right.

1181
00:46:32,705 --> 00:46:34,505
("Fishing Is the Easiest", Russia Special)

1182
00:46:35,105 --> 00:46:37,335
If you catch a king crab,

1183
00:46:38,105 --> 00:46:39,765
you will clear the mission.

1184
00:46:40,335 --> 00:46:44,305
We can't be staying here for a long time due to the flight time.

1185
00:46:44,365 --> 00:46:46,665
We'll check the fishing rods one last time.

1186
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:49,535
Shall I pull out king crabs now?

1187
00:46:49,535 --> 00:46:50,605
(They're hoping for the best with the fishing rods.)

1188
00:46:50,805 --> 00:46:51,865
Please.

1189
00:46:51,865 --> 00:46:54,165
- Let's start with this and move on. - All right.

1190
00:46:54,305 --> 00:46:55,405
Okay.

1191
00:46:55,735 --> 00:46:57,505
(They check the first rod.)

1192
00:46:57,505 --> 00:46:58,665
Please.

1193
00:46:59,535 --> 00:47:01,705
In Russia, king crab...

1194
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,005
It is or isn't here.

1195
00:47:03,005 --> 00:47:04,865
- Not here. - I see.

1196
00:47:05,535 --> 00:47:08,105
- The first rod is a failure. - A failure.

1197
00:47:09,465 --> 00:47:11,735
(The second rod is a failure too.)

1198
00:47:11,735 --> 00:47:12,965
A miracle will happen.

1199
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:15,905
I hope for a miracle.

1200
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:20,865
(The third rod is a failure too.)

1201
00:47:22,235 --> 00:47:25,205
(They want a king crab desperately.)

1202
00:47:25,205 --> 00:47:26,435
Wait, I can feel something.

1203
00:47:27,005 --> 00:47:28,035
Wait, I can feel something.

1204
00:47:28,035 --> 00:47:30,335
(He feels something different.)

1205
00:47:30,335 --> 00:47:32,965
(It's the last rod.)

1206
00:47:32,965 --> 00:47:34,265
(Did he catch a king crab?)

1207
00:47:34,265 --> 00:47:36,035
It's our last hope, Se Chan.

1208
00:47:36,035 --> 00:47:38,165
(Did he catch a king crab?)

1209
00:47:40,165 --> 00:47:43,465
(Nothing is caught.)

1210
00:47:44,205 --> 00:47:45,365
- Nothing? - We didn't catch it.

1211
00:47:45,735 --> 00:47:46,935
Nothing.

1212
00:47:46,935 --> 00:47:48,805
(It was their last hope.)

1213
00:47:48,805 --> 00:47:52,635
(They're disappointed that a king crab didn't show up until the end.)

1214
00:47:52,635 --> 00:47:55,935
It was close, but you couldn't catch a king crab.

1215
00:47:56,035 --> 00:47:57,565
So you failed the mission.

1216
00:47:57,565 --> 00:47:59,405
(They fail the mission.)

1217
00:47:59,405 --> 00:48:01,265
I can't believe this.

1218
00:48:01,365 --> 00:48:02,605
We were so close.

1219
00:48:02,605 --> 00:48:03,605
(It was so close.)

1220
00:48:03,605 --> 00:48:05,335
(He feels bad.)

1221
00:48:05,335 --> 00:48:07,565
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1222
00:48:07,565 --> 00:48:09,635
(Thank you for your help, captain.)

1223
00:48:09,635 --> 00:48:13,735
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1224
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:16,605
- Let's go. - Okay.

1225
00:48:16,865 --> 00:48:19,035
- I feel bad. - Gosh, seriously.

1226
00:48:19,035 --> 00:48:20,465
(They were so close to clearing the mission.)

1227
00:48:20,465 --> 00:48:22,765
I won't be able to eat king crabs for a while.

1228
00:48:23,105 --> 00:48:25,435
- It doesn't feel satisfying. - It doesn't.

1229
00:48:26,005 --> 00:48:29,405
Only if we had caught it, everything would've gone as we wanted.

1230
00:48:29,405 --> 00:48:30,935
- Right. - Everything.

1231
00:48:32,435 --> 00:48:34,135
Hey, so many crabs are here.

1232
00:48:34,135 --> 00:48:36,205
(Hey, so many crabs are here.)

1233
00:48:37,435 --> 00:48:41,305
(They find crabs near the port.)

1234
00:48:41,305 --> 00:48:43,335
(Catch us if you can.)

1235
00:48:43,335 --> 00:48:45,565
- It's here. - I found them.

1236
00:48:45,605 --> 00:48:47,805
- We need a net. - A scoop net.

1237
00:48:48,005 --> 00:48:49,565
We must catch this.

1238
00:48:49,565 --> 00:48:51,465
(It was so hard to find any, but they run into the crabs here.)

1239
00:48:51,465 --> 00:48:53,335
We still have a chance.

1240
00:48:53,335 --> 00:48:55,505
It's our one last chance.

1241
00:48:55,505 --> 00:48:57,505
But this net is not knitted tightly.

1242
00:48:57,505 --> 00:48:59,305
Wait. Hold on.

1243
00:48:59,305 --> 00:49:01,005
- Where is it? - Here.

1244
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:03,365
Gosh, how should we catch it?

1245
00:49:04,135 --> 00:49:07,105
(They can't miss this chance.)

1246
00:49:08,235 --> 00:49:09,865
- It's our last chance. - Yes.

1247
00:49:09,865 --> 00:49:12,565
- What should I do? - Should we just scrape it up?

1248
00:49:12,565 --> 00:49:14,405
(It's really a failure if they miss this chance.)

1249
00:49:14,405 --> 00:49:16,405
(Will they catch it?)

1250
00:49:16,405 --> 00:49:17,865
What do we do? Hold on.

1251
00:49:18,135 --> 00:49:19,565
Hold on.

1252
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,405
I'll go get a stick. Hold on.

1253
00:49:21,405 --> 00:49:22,565
(You can't catch it with just a net.)

1254
00:49:23,235 --> 00:49:24,465
Hold on.

1255
00:49:25,335 --> 00:49:26,435
(Dropping)

1256
00:49:28,905 --> 00:49:31,105
I can't take this any longer. This is so frustrating.

1257
00:49:34,035 --> 00:49:36,135
(Preparing)

1258
00:49:36,135 --> 00:49:39,765
(He takes his jumper off and prepares to go in the water.)

1259
00:49:39,765 --> 00:49:41,065
Are you going in?

1260
00:49:41,365 --> 00:49:43,665
We can't catch it otherwise.

1261
00:49:43,865 --> 00:49:46,565
- Can you go in? - I can't catch it if I don't go in.

1262
00:49:46,565 --> 00:49:49,735
(He's willing to sacrifice himself...)

1263
00:49:49,735 --> 00:49:52,105
(if at least one of them can be saved.)

1264
00:49:52,105 --> 00:49:53,735
- It's our last chance. - Yes.

1265
00:49:53,735 --> 00:49:56,235
(He's willing to sacrifice himself if one of them can be saved.)

1266
00:49:57,935 --> 00:49:59,335
(Going into the Russian sea)

1267
00:49:59,335 --> 00:50:01,565
Goodness. I can feel the water soaking up.

1268
00:50:06,205 --> 00:50:07,305
There we go.

1269
00:50:07,305 --> 00:50:09,205
(They show perfect teamwork by helping each other.)

1270
00:50:09,205 --> 00:50:10,405
Okay.

1271
00:50:10,405 --> 00:50:11,805
- Do you see it? - Yes.

1272
00:50:12,105 --> 00:50:13,305
It's here.

1273
00:50:13,505 --> 00:50:15,965
- Get me the gloves. - The gloves.

1274
00:50:16,435 --> 00:50:17,735
Hold on.

1275
00:50:17,735 --> 00:50:19,565
(They put on the gloves to catch it.)

1276
00:50:19,905 --> 00:50:21,565
Here's a king crab. Here. I'll do it.

1277
00:50:24,205 --> 00:50:25,505
That's it!

1278
00:50:25,505 --> 00:50:26,905
It's a king crab!

1279
00:50:27,005 --> 00:50:30,265
(Are you sure it's a king crab?)

1280
00:50:30,265 --> 00:50:32,505
- Here. - You actually caught one.

1281
00:50:32,705 --> 00:50:34,835
- Let me see. - We caught it!

1282
00:50:35,005 --> 00:50:36,405
Gosh.

1283
00:50:36,405 --> 00:50:37,605
Don't laugh!

1284
00:50:37,605 --> 00:50:38,965
(They finally catch a king crab.)

1285
00:50:38,965 --> 00:50:40,265
Don't laugh!

1286
00:50:40,265 --> 00:50:41,505
It is a king crab.

1287
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:44,135
- It is a king crab. - What happened?

1288
00:50:44,335 --> 00:50:45,665
How's that a king crab?

1289
00:50:46,505 --> 00:50:48,705
When it grows, it becomes a king crab.

1290
00:50:49,405 --> 00:50:50,405
What?

1291
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,565
We caught a king crab.

1292
00:50:52,635 --> 00:50:54,835
- Please make a judgment. - Please make a judgment.

1293
00:50:55,005 --> 00:50:58,265
We're here to find crabs. It's a crab anyway.

1294
00:50:58,505 --> 00:51:00,605
You've caught 10 different types of seafood.

1295
00:51:00,605 --> 00:51:02,165
- Yes. - However,

1296
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:04,535
you failed to catch king crabs.

1297
00:51:05,005 --> 00:51:07,305
However,

1298
00:51:07,405 --> 00:51:10,365
- you caught a small crab. - It's a medium crab.

1299
00:51:10,535 --> 00:51:15,165
We'll have to think if it counts as a king crab.

1300
00:51:15,365 --> 00:51:18,035
We'll let you know the result...

1301
00:51:18,205 --> 00:51:19,305
at the next shooting.

1302
00:51:19,705 --> 00:51:23,335
(What will happen to Team Jong Kook?)

1303
00:51:26,435 --> 00:51:29,165
(A few days later, at Incheon International Airport)

1304
00:51:31,705 --> 00:51:33,635
(It's finally the Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear day.)

1305
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:35,505
- Well... - I don't feel so good.

1306
00:51:36,005 --> 00:51:38,165
- Good morning. - Good morning.

1307
00:51:38,705 --> 00:51:40,505
I can't believe we're actually going.

1308
00:51:40,505 --> 00:51:42,635
Kwang Soo, here.

1309
00:51:42,635 --> 00:51:44,965
(No-looking passes are popular at airports these days.)

1310
00:51:44,965 --> 00:51:46,065
Gosh.

1311
00:51:46,065 --> 00:51:48,165
Why did you pass me your luggage without even looking at me?

1312
00:51:48,165 --> 00:51:49,405
- Just hold it. - What?

1313
00:51:49,405 --> 00:51:50,435
- Keep an eye on my luggage. - Okay.

1314
00:51:50,435 --> 00:51:51,905
- Do you want to go in? - No.

1315
00:51:51,905 --> 00:51:53,265
- Do you want to? - No.

1316
00:51:53,335 --> 00:51:55,265
- Where is Jong Kook going? - What do you mean?

1317
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:56,365
It's just an overnight trip.

1318
00:51:56,365 --> 00:51:58,205
You never know what will happen.

1319
00:51:58,205 --> 00:51:59,505
- Oh, my. - The funny thing is,

1320
00:51:59,505 --> 00:52:02,505
he probably has 30 pairs of shorts in it.

1321
00:52:02,505 --> 00:52:04,305
30 pairs of shorts.

1322
00:52:04,305 --> 00:52:05,865
- 30 pairs of shorts. - That's accurate.

1323
00:52:05,865 --> 00:52:07,105
Hey.

1324
00:52:07,105 --> 00:52:09,105
He's making fun of you.

1325
00:52:09,105 --> 00:52:10,765
Se Chan.

1326
00:52:10,765 --> 00:52:12,435
- You're hiding there. - He's making fun of you.

1327
00:52:12,435 --> 00:52:13,705
It's not decided yet.

1328
00:52:13,705 --> 00:52:15,205
- Se Chan. - Jong Kook.

1329
00:52:15,205 --> 00:52:17,005
- It's a no-looking pass. - Se Chan.

1330
00:52:17,005 --> 00:52:18,535
- Be careful. - It's so funny.

1331
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:20,305
- Be careful. - Okay.

1332
00:52:20,605 --> 00:52:22,935
Seok Jin, where is all your stuff?

1333
00:52:23,505 --> 00:52:26,435
Last time, you guys didn't bring so much stuff.

1334
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:27,805
That's why.

1335
00:52:27,805 --> 00:52:29,365
- Everyone has so much today. - You should have brought more.

1336
00:52:29,365 --> 00:52:32,235
I'm using the bag from our Mongolia trip.

1337
00:52:32,235 --> 00:52:34,235
- Really? - Did you steal it?

1338
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:36,905
- Did you steal it? - No.

1339
00:52:36,905 --> 00:52:38,005
You should return it.

1340
00:52:38,005 --> 00:52:39,905
- Return it. - Return it.

1341
00:52:39,905 --> 00:52:41,105
You should return it.

1342
00:52:41,105 --> 00:52:43,705
- It was in the car. - Stop stealing stuff.

1343
00:52:43,865 --> 00:52:47,535
She's a famous thief in Yeonnam-dong.

1344
00:52:47,535 --> 00:52:48,535
- It's true. - It's true.

1345
00:52:48,535 --> 00:52:50,305
(So Min is a famous thief in Yeonnam-dong.)

1346
00:52:50,305 --> 00:52:52,535
- Tell them the story. - She's a thief?

1347
00:52:52,535 --> 00:52:55,405
We had a drink together the other night.

1348
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:58,365
- She has sticky fingers. - Really?

1349
00:52:58,365 --> 00:52:59,635
That's not true.

1350
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:01,635
It's Kwang Soo's fault.

1351
00:53:01,635 --> 00:53:03,505
These two have a problem.

1352
00:53:03,505 --> 00:53:04,605
(You'll find out what happened among them soon.)

1353
00:53:05,305 --> 00:53:08,465
As the finale of the Global Project,

1354
00:53:08,765 --> 00:53:10,335
we'll visit Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.

1355
00:53:10,335 --> 00:53:12,365
(Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear)

1356
00:53:13,035 --> 00:53:16,265
(We're finally going.)

1357
00:53:16,535 --> 00:53:18,905
We finally got our visas today.

1358
00:53:18,905 --> 00:53:21,335
My family has been wondering.

1359
00:53:21,335 --> 00:53:23,205
- Why you're not going? - Exactly.

1360
00:53:23,265 --> 00:53:25,165
They wonder why I'm still not possessed.

1361
00:53:25,305 --> 00:53:26,735
My family has been wondering.

1362
00:53:27,105 --> 00:53:31,335
Before we leave, let me announce the mission result...

1363
00:53:31,405 --> 00:53:34,165
which will determine who will be excluded from the visit.

1364
00:53:34,165 --> 00:53:35,165
(The results are announced.)

1365
00:53:35,905 --> 00:53:40,005
(If the mission has been completed, the team leader will exclude 2.)

1366
00:53:40,005 --> 00:53:45,905
(Who will visit Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear?)

1367
00:53:45,905 --> 00:53:48,505
Team Russia's result is not clear.

1368
00:53:48,505 --> 00:53:52,065
- That's right. - We completed the mission.

1369
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:54,035
You said you'd let us know the result today.

1370
00:53:54,235 --> 00:53:55,965
- I'll announce it now. - Okay.

1371
00:53:55,965 --> 00:53:57,065
First, Team Mongolia...

1372
00:53:57,405 --> 00:54:02,205
failed to complete their mission to milk sheep.

1373
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:04,435
(Team Mongolia failed to complete their mission.)

1374
00:54:04,435 --> 00:54:09,405
The thing is, the lambs drank all the milk that morning.

1375
00:54:09,405 --> 00:54:11,305
- You should have squeezed it out. - They drank all the milk.

1376
00:54:11,305 --> 00:54:13,435
- We squeezed the udders until... - It didn't work.

1377
00:54:13,435 --> 00:54:15,365
Let's stop talking about udders already!

1378
00:54:15,705 --> 00:54:17,535
(Those darn udders!)

1379
00:54:17,535 --> 00:54:18,905
I'm sick of hearing about udders.

1380
00:54:18,905 --> 00:54:21,265
- What happened? - Why?

1381
00:54:21,265 --> 00:54:22,865
Udders are beautiful.

1382
00:54:22,865 --> 00:54:24,935
- Stop it. - I'm sick of it.

1383
00:54:25,005 --> 00:54:26,165
Team Russia.

1384
00:54:26,405 --> 00:54:29,905
Jong Kook, Haha, Kwang Soo, and Se Chan...

1385
00:54:29,905 --> 00:54:32,435
were supposed to catch king crabs and 10 types of seafood.

1386
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,635
Yes.

1387
00:54:33,635 --> 00:54:35,105
- We did it. - We did everything.

1388
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,605
It's not clear.

1389
00:54:36,605 --> 00:54:39,705
You succeeded in catching 10 types of seafood.

1390
00:54:39,705 --> 00:54:41,065
- Yes. - Yes.

1391
00:54:41,065 --> 00:54:42,065
But...

1392
00:54:42,065 --> 00:54:45,235
(But?)

1393
00:54:45,235 --> 00:54:48,435
- The crab you caught at the end... - Yes.

1394
00:54:48,905 --> 00:54:50,405
- It was very hard to tell. - Yes.

1395
00:54:50,405 --> 00:54:52,805
So we consulted the Marine Biodiversity Institute of Korea.

1396
00:54:52,805 --> 00:54:54,665
- Really? - You did?

1397
00:54:58,005 --> 00:55:01,765
(They caught a crab right before the deadline.)

1398
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:03,505
(This crab will...)

1399
00:55:03,505 --> 00:55:07,005
(determine their fate.)

1400
00:55:07,335 --> 00:55:08,335
- Really? - We found out what it is.

1401
00:55:08,335 --> 00:55:10,335
(They consulted a professional.)

1402
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:12,365
It turned out not to be a king crab,

1403
00:55:12,365 --> 00:55:15,505
but an Asian shore crab.

1404
00:55:15,505 --> 00:55:17,305
(Did we fail?)

1405
00:55:17,305 --> 00:55:19,365
- An Asian shore crab? - It's not a king crab?

1406
00:55:19,365 --> 00:55:20,405
They failed.

1407
00:55:20,405 --> 00:55:22,705
However,

1408
00:55:22,705 --> 00:55:24,635
it's a type of crab anyway.

1409
00:55:24,635 --> 00:55:25,635
- So? - Really?

1410
00:55:25,635 --> 00:55:27,165
After a discussion,

1411
00:55:27,165 --> 00:55:28,805
we concluded that you completed half the mission.

1412
00:55:28,805 --> 00:55:31,605
Jong Kook can choose one person...

1413
00:55:31,605 --> 00:55:32,805
who will be excluded from the penalty.

1414
00:55:32,805 --> 00:55:34,365
(Just one member will be excluded.)

1415
00:55:34,365 --> 00:55:36,235
(Hurrying)

1416
00:55:36,235 --> 00:55:37,865
I'm sorry for mentioning about your shorts.

1417
00:55:37,865 --> 00:55:40,105
I'm sorry. I didn't know this would happen.

1418
00:55:40,105 --> 00:55:42,365
- Pass me your luggage! - No, pass it onto me.

1419
00:55:42,365 --> 00:55:45,235
You know how easily I get scared.

1420
00:55:45,235 --> 00:55:47,165
- Go away. - I'm so easily scared.

1421
00:55:47,165 --> 00:55:48,505
Go away.

1422
00:55:48,505 --> 00:55:50,065
I'm so unlucky.

1423
00:55:50,065 --> 00:55:51,065
I did my best.

1424
00:55:51,065 --> 00:55:53,535
Do I have to decide right now? I want to wait.

1425
00:55:53,535 --> 00:55:55,235
- Do I have to decide right now? - Please.

1426
00:55:55,235 --> 00:55:57,505
Jong Kook, please.

1427
00:55:57,505 --> 00:55:59,265
Your arms need to breathe.

1428
00:55:59,265 --> 00:56:00,905
Stretch my t-shirt.

1429
00:56:00,905 --> 00:56:02,735
- Please. - Stretch my t-shirt.

1430
00:56:03,505 --> 00:56:04,805
(Please)

1431
00:56:04,805 --> 00:56:06,135
Guys.

1432
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:09,405
Do I have to choose one member right now?

1433
00:56:09,505 --> 00:56:13,865
Jong Kook will decide, among Haha, Kwang Soo, and Se Chan,

1434
00:56:14,005 --> 00:56:16,765
who will be excluded from the visit to the Labyrinth...

1435
00:56:16,765 --> 00:56:19,905
by hugging the member from behind.

1436
00:56:20,065 --> 00:56:21,635
This is hard.

1437
00:56:23,335 --> 00:56:25,365
Isn't it already decided? Hey, come here.

1438
00:56:25,365 --> 00:56:26,865
(Hey, come here.)

1439
00:56:27,065 --> 00:56:28,965
- It's over. - Why?

1440
00:56:28,965 --> 00:56:31,035
- It's over. - Seriously...

1441
00:56:31,065 --> 00:56:32,735
Stand over there.

1442
00:56:33,005 --> 00:56:34,505
Guys, stand over there.

1443
00:56:34,505 --> 00:56:36,005
Kwang Soo is...

1444
00:56:36,005 --> 00:56:37,365
He's...

1445
00:56:37,365 --> 00:56:38,805
- He doesn't have to do this. - It's a competition.

1446
00:56:38,805 --> 00:56:40,805
Isn't it already decided?

1447
00:56:41,105 --> 00:56:43,905
Here we go. This is not that important.

1448
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:46,265
Jong Kook.

1449
00:56:46,905 --> 00:56:49,305
If you've made up your mind, choose one member now.

1450
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:51,765
Please. Jong Kook, please.

1451
00:56:52,005 --> 00:56:56,235
It won't hurt to experience it once.

1452
00:56:56,235 --> 00:56:58,005
I did my best.

1453
00:56:58,065 --> 00:56:59,505
I have no regrets.

1454
00:57:00,535 --> 00:57:02,305
- Please. - Hey.

1455
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:03,335
Please.

1456
00:57:03,335 --> 00:57:05,005
(Their fate is in Jong Kook's hands.)

1457
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:12,805
(Is it Kwang Soo?)

1458
00:57:12,805 --> 00:57:14,605
(Is it Se Chan?)

1459
00:57:16,165 --> 00:57:18,705
(Or is it Haha?)

1460
00:57:30,305 --> 00:57:32,065
- Please. - Please.

1461
00:57:32,065 --> 00:57:33,635
- Hey. - Please.

1462
00:57:33,635 --> 00:57:38,905
(Is it Kwang Soo?)

1463
00:57:38,905 --> 00:57:40,705
(Is it Se Chan?)

1464
00:57:42,335 --> 00:57:44,405
(Or is it Haha?)

1465
00:57:48,705 --> 00:57:54,135
(Haha always ratted on the other members.)

1466
00:57:56,205 --> 00:58:02,305
(Se Chan has been thoughtfully taking care of Jong Kook.)

1467
00:58:03,735 --> 00:58:07,765
(Kwang Soo has found every opportunity to betray Jong Kook.)

1468
00:58:09,205 --> 00:58:11,705
(It's not easy to choose just one member.)

1469
00:58:11,705 --> 00:58:14,905
(It's such a difficult decision.)

1470
00:58:14,905 --> 00:58:18,605
(Who will Jong Kook exclude from the visit?)

1471
00:58:20,605 --> 00:58:23,435
Here we go. 1, 2, 3.

1472
00:58:23,435 --> 00:58:26,165
(The final decision)

1473
00:58:27,065 --> 00:58:35,065
(Whom will Jong Kook choose?)

1474
00:58:35,165 --> 00:58:36,335
(Turning)

1475
00:58:36,535 --> 00:58:38,405
(Haha is chosen.)

1476
00:58:38,705 --> 00:58:39,705
Three!

1477
00:58:39,805 --> 00:58:42,805
(Se Chan and Kwang Soo receive the honor of the Labyrinth.)

1478
00:58:43,135 --> 00:58:44,735
That was predictable.

1479
00:58:45,135 --> 00:58:47,105
(I'm safe.)

1480
00:58:47,335 --> 00:58:48,335
I'm safe.

1481
00:58:49,205 --> 00:58:51,335
Kwang Soo, why are you...

1482
00:58:51,335 --> 00:58:53,635
- What were you expecting? - What were you expecting?

1483
00:58:53,635 --> 00:58:56,365
- Seriously... - I made up my mind...

1484
00:58:56,405 --> 00:58:58,335
when we were leaving for Russia.

1485
00:58:58,335 --> 00:58:59,535
We knew that. Kwang Soo must not have known.

1486
00:58:59,535 --> 00:59:00,805
Only he did not.

1487
00:59:00,805 --> 00:59:03,005
You were worse than me.

1488
00:59:03,005 --> 00:59:05,265
(Jong Kook, you were the worst.)

1489
00:59:06,205 --> 00:59:07,405
- Me? - You.

1490
00:59:07,405 --> 00:59:08,635
- Are you talking about me? - Yes, you.

1491
00:59:08,635 --> 00:59:09,865
I see.

1492
00:59:09,865 --> 00:59:12,235
I'm talking about you, the tanned one.

1493
00:59:13,305 --> 00:59:15,105
All right.

1494
00:59:15,205 --> 00:59:16,805
When you enter the Labyrinth,

1495
00:59:16,805 --> 00:59:18,905
I'll be in there wearing scary makeup.

1496
00:59:18,905 --> 00:59:19,935
You think it's over?

1497
00:59:21,105 --> 00:59:22,765
Do we have no chance at all?

1498
00:59:22,765 --> 00:59:26,505
The five of you have to enter the Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.

1499
00:59:27,335 --> 00:59:28,805
It's going to be so fun.

1500
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:31,505
- Right? - Stay tuned.

1501
00:59:33,605 --> 00:59:35,765
- So Min. - Gosh.

1502
00:59:35,765 --> 00:59:38,335
You have to do it.

1503
00:59:38,335 --> 00:59:40,435
I'm a bit worried because there are five of us.

1504
00:59:40,435 --> 00:59:43,505
- What? - One will be left out.

1505
00:59:43,505 --> 00:59:45,905
The three of you look like the group Koyote.

1506
00:59:45,905 --> 00:59:48,105
(You guys look like a set.)

1507
00:59:48,105 --> 00:59:49,605
- Koyote? - You're Kim Jong Min.

1508
00:59:49,605 --> 00:59:50,905
- Koyote? - Is Kwang Soo Bbaek Ga?

1509
00:59:50,905 --> 00:59:52,335
- No. - He's Bbaek Ga.

1510
00:59:52,335 --> 00:59:53,505
He's Bbaek Ga.

1511
00:59:53,505 --> 00:59:54,635
We're Koyote 2017.

1512
00:59:54,635 --> 00:59:57,135
(Koyote 2017)

1513
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,965
(I'm Shin Ji.)

1514
01:00:00,365 --> 01:00:03,965
You two are Yukgaksu.

1515
01:00:04,665 --> 01:00:06,205
Heung Bo is dumbfounded

1516
01:00:06,205 --> 01:00:07,365
- Do it. - What?

1517
01:00:07,365 --> 01:00:08,705
My goodness.

1518
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:10,305
They're Green Area.

1519
01:00:10,365 --> 01:00:11,805
Green Area?

1520
01:00:11,805 --> 01:00:14,535
- Green Area. - Green Area.

1521
01:00:14,665 --> 01:00:16,835
- They're Soo and Jin. - Forever with you

1522
01:00:16,835 --> 01:00:18,805
This is not fun.

1523
01:00:19,105 --> 01:00:20,465
- Let's go. - I don't feel happy,

1524
01:00:20,465 --> 01:00:22,535
- so it's not fun. - Why do I feel depressed?

1525
01:00:22,735 --> 01:00:25,805
- Haha is too happy. - You never know.

1526
01:00:27,505 --> 01:00:31,535
(They will be receiving the penalty.)

1527
01:00:32,865 --> 01:00:36,065
(Narita Airport, Japan)

1528
01:00:37,335 --> 01:00:38,605
(Complaining)

1529
01:00:38,605 --> 01:00:40,535
It feels like spring.

1530
01:00:40,535 --> 01:00:42,665
(The weather is great, but they look concerned.)

1531
01:00:44,305 --> 01:00:46,405
We're on a trip, but I don't feel great.

1532
01:00:46,565 --> 01:00:48,865
Everybody, you have arrived in Japan.

1533
01:00:48,865 --> 01:00:50,535
I feel...

1534
01:00:50,535 --> 01:00:54,165
- heavy at heart. - I don't feel great either.

1535
01:00:54,165 --> 01:00:56,935
For those who have been exempted from penalty...

1536
01:00:56,935 --> 01:00:58,235
(Jong Kook, Ji Hyo and Haha are exempt.)

1537
01:00:58,235 --> 01:01:02,165
- You'll be going to Yokohama. - What?

1538
01:01:02,165 --> 01:01:07,235
- Are we going to different places? - It's a beautiful port city.

1539
01:01:07,965 --> 01:01:09,735
Your expenses will be unlimited...

1540
01:01:09,735 --> 01:01:11,335
- No way. - Why?

1541
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:13,135
(They can travel freely with no cap on expenses.)

1542
01:01:14,705 --> 01:01:16,305
- You can't do that. - Really?

1543
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:18,865
(They get a map and a corporate card with no limit.)

1544
01:01:19,535 --> 01:01:20,705
(Yokohama Tour)

1545
01:01:20,705 --> 01:01:26,435
(It's a free tour without penalty or limit on expenses.)

1546
01:01:26,435 --> 01:01:30,365
(It's truly the best tour.)

1547
01:01:30,365 --> 01:01:32,605
- You can't do that. - We can go together.

1548
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:34,805
(I'm sorry.)

1549
01:01:34,805 --> 01:01:37,165
(He provokes them.)

1550
01:01:37,635 --> 01:01:39,105
We're unlucky.

1551
01:01:39,105 --> 01:01:41,705
Have fun. I'll watch you on television.

1552
01:01:41,705 --> 01:01:43,535
It'll be funnier to go with you.

1553
01:01:43,765 --> 01:01:45,365
You're the main show.

1554
01:01:45,905 --> 01:01:46,905
(He provokes them more.)

1555
01:01:47,365 --> 01:01:49,165
Let's go!

1556
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:50,805
- Yes! - They look so happy.

1557
01:01:51,065 --> 01:01:52,165
Come on in.

1558
01:01:52,465 --> 01:01:53,605
Look at Haha.

1559
01:01:53,705 --> 01:01:54,835
They look so happy.

1560
01:01:54,935 --> 01:01:58,165
I can't go. I can't.

1561
01:01:58,165 --> 01:02:01,535
I can't go to the Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.

1562
01:02:01,905 --> 01:02:03,205
We're leaving.

1563
01:02:03,605 --> 01:02:05,135
(Laughing)

1564
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:09,005
- Oh, dear. - My gosh.

1565
01:02:09,365 --> 01:02:11,005
Are we really going?

1566
01:02:11,005 --> 01:02:12,105
- Take me while I'm sitting. - I really...

1567
01:02:12,105 --> 01:02:13,735
- don't want to go. - This is unprecedented.

1568
01:02:13,965 --> 01:02:15,435
We have to go to the Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear...

1569
01:02:16,005 --> 01:02:17,165
- while... - Is that what it's called?

1570
01:02:17,165 --> 01:02:18,565
I have a stomachache.

1571
01:02:18,565 --> 01:02:19,705
Stop lying.

1572
01:02:20,235 --> 01:02:21,735
You're lying.

1573
01:02:21,735 --> 01:02:24,165
- No, Jae Seok. - Come on.

1574
01:02:24,335 --> 01:02:25,635
You're lying.

1575
01:02:26,505 --> 01:02:29,035
This is the finale of the Dangerous Trip...

1576
01:02:29,035 --> 01:02:31,005
we've been working towards for a long time.

1577
01:02:31,005 --> 01:02:32,035
(This is the final destination.)

1578
01:02:32,305 --> 01:02:35,405
(These five members will be celebrating the finale.)

1579
01:02:35,405 --> 01:02:38,065
You'll get in a car and head to...

1580
01:02:38,305 --> 01:02:40,765
Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear for your penalty.

1581
01:02:41,465 --> 01:02:42,635
However...

1582
01:02:42,735 --> 01:02:45,905
(However?)

1583
01:02:45,935 --> 01:02:47,335
However?

1584
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:50,865
- There are five of you, right? - Yes.

1585
01:02:50,965 --> 01:02:53,405
You can't all go in together,

1586
01:02:53,835 --> 01:02:56,265
so it'll be 2 groups of 2 and 1 person by himself or herself.

1587
01:02:56,265 --> 01:02:57,335
We can't do one person.

1588
01:02:57,335 --> 01:02:58,705
(2 groups of 2 and 1 alone)

1589
01:02:58,705 --> 01:03:02,905
(You have to enter the Labyrinth alone?)

1590
01:03:03,105 --> 01:03:07,735
(It's too much to go in there by yourself.)

1591
01:03:07,735 --> 01:03:09,935
(Going in there will test your limits.)

1592
01:03:09,935 --> 01:03:12,665
Let's do 3 and 2. It's too scary to go by yourself.

1593
01:03:12,805 --> 01:03:14,605
- 1 person? - Just 1?

1594
01:03:14,765 --> 01:03:18,805
- Would you be okay, So Min? - Why would you say that?

1595
01:03:19,305 --> 01:03:21,005
- Is there another way? - Would you be okay, Kwang Soo?

1596
01:03:21,365 --> 01:03:23,005
No. Don't do that.

1597
01:03:23,405 --> 01:03:25,065
I was born in 1985. Don't do that.

1598
01:03:25,305 --> 01:03:27,105
How will you choose who goes alone?

1599
01:03:27,605 --> 01:03:32,005
On our way to the destination, there will be three rounds of missions.

1600
01:03:32,005 --> 01:03:33,265
It'll be me for certain.

1601
01:03:33,265 --> 01:03:35,005
The person who loses a mission...

1602
01:03:35,005 --> 01:03:39,005
will write their name on the roulette multiple times.

1603
01:03:39,005 --> 01:03:41,635
- Roulette? - It might be 4 or 5 times.

1604
01:03:42,465 --> 01:03:48,205
(They'll spin the roulette at the end to choose who goes alone.)

1605
01:03:48,665 --> 01:03:50,965
I'm actually confident with these people.

1606
01:03:51,635 --> 01:03:52,905
(It's the Unlucky Avengers.)

1607
01:03:53,565 --> 01:03:55,865
I don't know about others, but I can beat these people.

1608
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:58,235
This is so close. I have no idea who will lose.

1609
01:03:58,765 --> 01:04:00,165
Watch me. I'll never lose.

1610
01:04:00,565 --> 01:04:03,105
To start off, write your name in a space each.

1611
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:05,735
- This is driving me nuts. - I'm not so sure about this.

1612
01:04:06,365 --> 01:04:07,865
(Lee Kwang Soo, Jee Seok Jin)

1613
01:04:07,865 --> 01:04:09,365
I don't want to be next to Seok Jin.

1614
01:04:11,105 --> 01:04:14,665
(What will be the result of the roulette?)

1615
01:04:14,665 --> 01:04:17,765
- Let's go. - Let's see who's the worst.

1616
01:04:17,765 --> 01:04:19,765
- Let's go to the haunted house. - Let's go there...

1617
01:04:19,765 --> 01:04:23,065
Let's go there first. I heard they sell underwear,

1618
01:04:23,065 --> 01:04:24,265
- Okay. - so let's...

1619
01:04:24,265 --> 01:04:26,735
- Let's buy 20 each. - Let's just go.

1620
01:04:26,735 --> 01:04:28,705
If we end up needing extra underwear, please keep it a secret.

1621
01:04:29,105 --> 01:04:30,905
- Please edit it out. You have to. - Of course.

1622
01:04:31,265 --> 01:04:33,765
You five are united right now,

1623
01:04:33,835 --> 01:04:35,765
but there's a hidden mission.

1624
01:04:35,765 --> 01:04:37,905
(This is not the end.)

1625
01:04:38,405 --> 01:04:41,135
- There's a hidden mission. - What's that?

1626
01:04:41,935 --> 01:04:43,235
This is never-ending.

1627
01:04:43,305 --> 01:04:47,265
It's the longest labyrinth according to the Guinness Book of Records.

1628
01:04:47,665 --> 01:04:49,635
There are 15 ghosts in total.

1629
01:04:50,465 --> 01:04:53,865
Depending on Yokohama tour team's expenses,

1630
01:04:53,865 --> 01:04:55,705
more ghosts will be added.

1631
01:04:55,705 --> 01:04:59,605
(Ghosts will be added.)

1632
01:04:59,605 --> 01:05:03,565
(It'll be 1 ghost for every 20 dollars spent.)

1633
01:05:03,805 --> 01:05:06,435
You should have said that before they left.

1634
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:07,635
They already left.

1635
01:05:07,635 --> 01:05:10,065
Why are you trying to make our lives harder?

1636
01:05:10,065 --> 01:05:12,905
- If it's for every 20 dollars... - We've been here in a while,

1637
01:05:12,905 --> 01:05:15,905
but we haven't enjoyed anything in Japan.

1638
01:05:16,205 --> 01:05:19,165
If they eat, it'll be 3 more ghosts for us.

1639
01:05:19,235 --> 01:05:21,205
What did we do so wrong?

1640
01:05:21,205 --> 01:05:23,505
(How could you add ghosts as if you're ordering food?)

1641
01:05:23,505 --> 01:05:26,835
This is driving me nuts.

1642
01:05:26,835 --> 01:05:29,205
Let's leave for Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.

1643
01:05:29,205 --> 01:05:30,235
Let's go.

1644
01:05:30,235 --> 01:05:31,465
(They leave for Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

1645
01:05:32,405 --> 01:05:33,905
Thank you.

1646
01:05:34,005 --> 01:05:36,305
She's the only fan here to welcome us.

1647
01:05:36,305 --> 01:05:38,265
- Thank you. - She's a Japanese fan.

1648
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:45,705
(Be careful. You'll end up crying.)

1649
01:05:46,035 --> 01:05:47,435
"You will cry?"

1650
01:05:48,165 --> 01:05:50,165
- Really? - Yes.

1651
01:05:50,165 --> 01:05:52,705
It's really, really scary.

1652
01:05:52,705 --> 01:05:56,635
(That Labyrinth is beyond frightening.)

1653
01:05:56,965 --> 01:05:58,865
- What do we do? - Are you part of our group?

1654
01:05:59,965 --> 01:06:02,365
- Did you recruit her? - No, not at all.

1655
01:06:02,365 --> 01:06:04,005
(She's a local fan who was worried.)

1656
01:06:04,165 --> 01:06:05,635
- Is it really scary? - Yes.

1657
01:06:05,635 --> 01:06:07,105
- It's really scary. - What do we do?

1658
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:11,505
You might cry.

1659
01:06:11,505 --> 01:06:12,635
You think I'll cry?

1660
01:06:13,465 --> 01:06:14,635
You will.

1661
01:06:14,635 --> 01:06:16,005
(Be careful. You will cry.)

1662
01:06:16,165 --> 01:06:18,505
Oh, gosh. This is driving me nuts.

1663
01:06:18,505 --> 01:06:19,565
Bye.

1664
01:06:20,565 --> 01:06:25,265
(Please don't wet yourselves.)

1665
01:06:26,905 --> 01:06:28,105
It must be really scary.

1666
01:06:28,935 --> 01:06:30,465
I hate this.

1667
01:06:31,305 --> 01:06:33,005
I don't feel well.

1668
01:06:33,435 --> 01:06:35,335
What do I do now?

1669
01:06:35,465 --> 01:06:37,365
Let's just not go.

1670
01:06:37,565 --> 01:06:41,105
- Sure, let's go somewhere fun. - We can turn around from here.

1671
01:06:41,105 --> 01:06:45,035
- Sure. We'll do something else. - I didn't do anything wrong.

1672
01:06:45,035 --> 01:06:46,665
I'll try my best, Producer.

1673
01:06:46,665 --> 01:06:49,865
- I'll try my best. - Why are we even going?

1674
01:06:50,135 --> 01:06:53,105
I just don't want to go alone.

1675
01:06:53,205 --> 01:06:55,135
Wouldn't it be hard to go by yourself?

1676
01:06:55,305 --> 01:06:58,735
What now? What if I have to go in by myself?

1677
01:06:58,735 --> 01:07:00,005
I don't think I can do it.

1678
01:07:00,005 --> 01:07:01,905
(This is their instinct coming from 7 years of being on Running Man.)

1679
01:07:01,905 --> 01:07:03,435
This is driving me nuts.

1680
01:07:03,435 --> 01:07:06,835
(You can't go in there by yourself.)

1681
01:07:07,505 --> 01:07:09,165
How long does it take?

1682
01:07:09,165 --> 01:07:11,505
You must be hungry, right?

1683
01:07:11,505 --> 01:07:12,535
- Yes. - I'm hungry.

1684
01:07:13,005 --> 01:07:15,665
- There's a rest stop in 10 minutes. - Really?

1685
01:07:15,735 --> 01:07:17,765
You can eat.

1686
01:07:17,765 --> 01:07:19,605
I didn't know you'd feed us. Thank you.

1687
01:07:19,605 --> 01:07:22,165
- I like... - Food at rest stops are good.

1688
01:07:22,165 --> 01:07:26,235
- I'm trying to talk here. - Their food is good.

1689
01:07:27,005 --> 01:07:28,935
- I'm trying to talk. - Hey.

1690
01:07:29,305 --> 01:07:31,965
I can't even talk with you?

1691
01:07:32,835 --> 01:07:35,935
- Can't I say something? - We don't know what'll be edited.

1692
01:07:35,935 --> 01:07:37,735
- You don't know either. - Let's take turns.

1693
01:07:38,265 --> 01:07:41,835
Even if you go in pairs, who will it be safe to go with?

1694
01:07:42,105 --> 01:07:44,335
If you go in with either Seok Jin or Kwang Soo,

1695
01:07:44,335 --> 01:07:45,665
- you're dead. - That's the end.

1696
01:07:45,965 --> 01:07:47,405
It's better to go by yourself.

1697
01:07:47,405 --> 01:07:51,235
If I see a ghost, I'll hit you in the face and run away.

1698
01:07:51,635 --> 01:07:53,165
I'll hit you. I'm sorry.

1699
01:07:53,165 --> 01:07:55,335
He'll throw you to the ghost as a victim.

1700
01:07:55,335 --> 01:07:57,475
- He'll throw you. - I'm going to tell my mom.

1701
01:07:57,475 --> 01:07:58,605
Don't do that.

1702
01:07:58,605 --> 01:08:00,865
- I'm going to tell my mom. - Don't do that.

1703
01:08:00,865 --> 01:08:02,205
- Did you hear? - What?

1704
01:08:02,205 --> 01:08:03,765
- Kwang Soo slept over at So Min's. - He slept over.

1705
01:08:03,765 --> 01:08:05,475
(It's what the rumor says.)

1706
01:08:09,205 --> 01:08:10,805
- Kwang Soo slept over at So Min's. - He slept over.

1707
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,335
- What? - He slept over at her place.

1708
01:08:13,335 --> 01:08:15,835
- Can you tell us about this? - Hey.

1709
01:08:15,835 --> 01:08:17,735
- You slept over at her place? - Tell us about it.

1710
01:08:17,735 --> 01:08:20,265
- That's not it. - You have to clarify yourself.

1711
01:08:20,435 --> 01:08:22,705
- Hey. - Why would you sleep over?

1712
01:08:22,705 --> 01:08:24,475
If you put it that way, you might get the wrong idea.

1713
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:26,565
Let me say this then.

1714
01:08:27,035 --> 01:08:28,265
I won't think about it that way.

1715
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:30,765
(He won't think about it in the wrong way.)

1716
01:08:30,765 --> 01:08:32,305
- Why not? - Well...

1717
01:08:32,305 --> 01:08:34,205
We are young, unmarried man and woman.

1718
01:08:34,205 --> 01:08:36,365
I'm not interested in what's between you guys.

1719
01:08:36,365 --> 01:08:37,735
- Why not? - But...

1720
01:08:37,735 --> 01:08:40,105
- why did you go to her place? - Why did you sleep over?

1721
01:08:40,105 --> 01:08:42,505
Did he sleep over while your parents were there?

1722
01:08:42,505 --> 01:08:43,665
Her brother was there too.

1723
01:08:43,665 --> 01:08:45,405
- Her brother is a bodybuilder. - He slept with my family.

1724
01:08:45,405 --> 01:08:46,705
You must be out of your mind.

1725
01:08:46,705 --> 01:08:47,765
Tell us about it.

1726
01:08:47,765 --> 01:08:50,905
We went out drinking with Se Chan and a producer,

1727
01:08:51,365 --> 01:08:53,305
and I fell asleep in my car.

1728
01:08:53,475 --> 01:08:55,975
I couldn't wake up so the chauffeur...

1729
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:58,975
picked up the phone when So Min called me.

1730
01:08:59,365 --> 01:09:03,065
- He said you're not waking up. - He said I fell asleep...

1731
01:09:03,065 --> 01:09:06,135
and asked where she was. She said she was in Ilsan, so he went there.

1732
01:09:06,635 --> 01:09:09,265
She paid the driver.

1733
01:09:09,265 --> 01:09:12,265
She told me to sleep at her house where her parents were.

1734
01:09:12,475 --> 01:09:15,935
If I wasn't drunk, I would have said sorry and left but I was drunk,

1735
01:09:17,005 --> 01:09:19,735
so I asked if I could sleep over for the night.

1736
01:09:19,735 --> 01:09:21,435
(Can I sleep over?)

1737
01:09:21,435 --> 01:09:23,105
- This is... - I went upstairs...

1738
01:09:23,105 --> 01:09:24,305
He had a plan in mind.

1739
01:09:24,305 --> 01:09:25,865
This sounds too intentional.

1740
01:09:25,865 --> 01:09:27,975
- How? - The funny thing was...

1741
01:09:27,975 --> 01:09:31,265
that the chauffeur said Kwang Soo wasn't waking up,

1742
01:09:31,265 --> 01:09:33,865
but as soon as he got to my house, I called him and he woke up.

1743
01:09:34,405 --> 01:09:36,975
- Goodness. - No, I woke up midway.

1744
01:09:36,975 --> 01:09:38,305
- This isn't... - No way.

1745
01:09:38,305 --> 01:09:39,335
What are you talking about?

1746
01:09:39,335 --> 01:09:40,405
- So Min. - Yes?

1747
01:09:40,405 --> 01:09:41,665
That hurts.

1748
01:09:41,665 --> 01:09:43,305
- That's not it. - You...

1749
01:09:43,305 --> 01:09:44,505
- You need to... - That's not it.

1750
01:09:44,505 --> 01:09:46,005
- get hit. - No way.

1751
01:09:46,165 --> 01:09:48,235
- Why would I? Jae Seok. - Are you serious?

1752
01:09:48,305 --> 01:09:50,535
- No, that's not it. - Look at him.

1753
01:09:50,535 --> 01:09:52,235
I fell asleep and while I was sleeping,

1754
01:09:53,265 --> 01:09:56,475
- I felt somebody staring at me. - So?

1755
01:09:56,765 --> 01:09:58,005
I woke up,

1756
01:09:58,005 --> 01:10:00,865
and her dad was looking at me with the door slightly open.

1757
01:10:01,705 --> 01:10:04,475
(Who are you?)

1758
01:10:04,475 --> 01:10:07,105
He was staring at me while I was sleeping.

1759
01:10:07,105 --> 01:10:08,105
(There was a strange man sleeping at his house.)

1760
01:10:08,105 --> 01:10:09,735
I didn't know it was her dad in the beginning.

1761
01:10:09,735 --> 01:10:10,865
I was so shocked.

1762
01:10:10,865 --> 01:10:11,975
(Then So Min's dad said...)

1763
01:10:11,975 --> 01:10:15,105
I said, "Hello, sir. I'm sorry." Then he said,

1764
01:10:15,235 --> 01:10:18,635
"Can you come out and take a picture with me?"

1765
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,265
(Can you come out and take a picture with me?)

1766
01:10:20,705 --> 01:10:24,405
We took a picture in the living room with his arm around me,

1767
01:10:24,735 --> 01:10:26,035
and I went home.

1768
01:10:26,035 --> 01:10:27,505
(We are another family. This is our Day 1.)

1769
01:10:27,665 --> 01:10:29,665
Let's eat first.

1770
01:10:30,035 --> 01:10:32,205
Let's eat first and think about it later.

1771
01:10:32,205 --> 01:10:34,335
- First place I'm going in Japan... - Let's think about it later.

1772
01:10:34,535 --> 01:10:35,835
is a rest stop.

1773
01:10:35,935 --> 01:10:37,005
What?

1774
01:10:37,005 --> 01:10:38,305
- What's that? - Have one each.

1775
01:10:38,305 --> 01:10:40,435
- One each? - You're giving us money.

1776
01:10:40,435 --> 01:10:41,635
Is it 10 dollars or 100?

1777
01:10:41,635 --> 01:10:43,805
- It's 100 dollars. - That's great.

1778
01:10:43,805 --> 01:10:47,435
- You're giving us 100 dollars each? - That's 100,000 won.

1779
01:10:47,435 --> 01:10:48,765
Why are you giving us so much?

1780
01:10:48,905 --> 01:10:52,205
Okay, everybody. Here's your first mission.

1781
01:10:52,205 --> 01:10:55,065
- What is it? - Your first mission here...

1782
01:10:55,135 --> 01:10:57,235
is called Your Turn.

1783
01:10:57,235 --> 01:10:59,805
(First mission is Your Turn.)

1784
01:11:00,405 --> 01:11:01,865
(What turn?)

1785
01:11:01,865 --> 01:11:03,865
- Your Turn? - It must be from "Your Name".

1786
01:11:03,865 --> 01:11:07,665
You'll be eating at the rest stop.

1787
01:11:07,665 --> 01:11:11,535
Please order something different from each other,

1788
01:11:12,205 --> 01:11:16,105
and the owner of the dish to come out last loses.

1789
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,405
(Your name goes on the roulette if your food comes out last.)

1790
01:11:18,405 --> 01:11:19,405
I'm in trouble.

1791
01:11:19,405 --> 01:11:20,735
We have to order at the same time, right?

1792
01:11:20,865 --> 01:11:22,735
You can order whenever.

1793
01:11:22,735 --> 01:11:24,165
- We have to hurry. - If we...

1794
01:11:24,475 --> 01:11:26,475
Look at these guys.

1795
01:11:26,475 --> 01:11:30,605
(This was as predicted.)

1796
01:11:30,605 --> 01:11:33,005
You guys are so cheap.

1797
01:11:33,235 --> 01:11:38,705
(You must run to the rest stop first.)

1798
01:11:39,005 --> 01:11:40,475
(They were supposed to enjoy the atmosphere, but they just run.)

1799
01:11:40,475 --> 01:11:43,865
What's wrong with you? Why did you block me?

1800
01:11:43,865 --> 01:11:46,235
(They were supposed to enjoy the atmosphere but they just run.)

1801
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:48,205
(Dashing)

1802
01:11:48,205 --> 01:11:49,475
Pick anything.

1803
01:11:49,735 --> 01:11:52,705
Order whatever. What's what?

1804
01:11:53,035 --> 01:11:57,665
(What's the vending machine for?)

1805
01:11:58,535 --> 01:11:59,765
Do we have to use a vending machine?

1806
01:12:00,035 --> 01:12:01,505
- Hold on. - My gosh.

1807
01:12:01,505 --> 01:12:02,605
This is it.

1808
01:12:02,605 --> 01:12:04,505
There's a separate vending machine for each restaurant.

1809
01:12:04,505 --> 01:12:06,035
It's per restaurant?

1810
01:12:07,035 --> 01:12:08,235
I don't know what this is.

1811
01:12:08,935 --> 01:12:12,405
(He doesn't know what he ordered.)

1812
01:12:12,405 --> 01:12:14,335
Where's this?

1813
01:12:14,565 --> 01:12:17,235
(Everything is in Japanese.)

1814
01:12:17,735 --> 01:12:19,165
What did I just order?

1815
01:12:20,435 --> 01:12:22,505
Quick? Quick?

1816
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:27,505
(He starts speaking in Korean because he's in a hurry.)

1817
01:12:29,065 --> 01:12:30,365
Which one's fast?

1818
01:12:31,405 --> 01:12:32,405
- This? - Yes.

1819
01:12:32,405 --> 01:12:34,005
(Check him out.)

1820
01:12:34,005 --> 01:12:35,305
Which one's fast?

1821
01:12:35,765 --> 01:12:37,405
Fastest one. Hurry.

1822
01:12:37,535 --> 01:12:40,735
- Number 1 maybe. - Does number 1 take 2 minutes?

1823
01:12:41,205 --> 01:12:43,475
- 2 minutes. - 2 minutes. This one?

1824
01:12:43,935 --> 01:12:45,035
Okay.

1825
01:12:45,035 --> 01:12:46,475
(He chooses number 1 that's supposed to take 2 minutes.)

1826
01:12:46,475 --> 01:12:47,535
Number one.

1827
01:12:48,135 --> 01:12:49,505
Number one menu.

1828
01:12:50,805 --> 01:12:53,705
Hurry up, please. Hurry up. Please.

1829
01:12:53,835 --> 01:12:54,835
Excuse me.

1830
01:13:00,065 --> 01:13:01,135
Yes.

1831
01:13:02,305 --> 01:13:04,235
(We'll call your number. Please wait in your seat.)

1832
01:13:04,235 --> 01:13:06,935
(I'm Korean.)

1833
01:13:06,935 --> 01:13:11,365
(How are they talking to each other?)

1834
01:13:11,365 --> 01:13:12,735
Thank you.

1835
01:13:14,065 --> 01:13:15,335
Do you know what she said?

1836
01:13:15,365 --> 01:13:16,735
(What did she say?)

1837
01:13:19,205 --> 01:13:21,335
This is too intense.

1838
01:13:21,335 --> 01:13:22,435
Did you order, Jae Seok?

1839
01:13:22,635 --> 01:13:25,665
- What? - This wasn't what I wanted.

1840
01:13:25,665 --> 01:13:28,105
I don't know. I just pressed whatever.

1841
01:13:28,265 --> 01:13:30,635
They're going to say our number.

1842
01:13:31,035 --> 01:13:33,265
(Is this...)

1843
01:13:33,405 --> 01:13:35,665
(It's not yours.)

1844
01:13:35,665 --> 01:13:36,665
Sorry.

1845
01:13:36,665 --> 01:13:38,005
(When's mine coming out?)

1846
01:13:38,835 --> 01:13:39,905
I hope it comes out soon.

1847
01:13:39,905 --> 01:13:42,905
Thank you for waiting. Number 1 is ready.

1848
01:13:42,905 --> 01:13:45,335
Is it udon? It's udon.

1849
01:13:45,335 --> 01:13:47,865
Who ordered udon there?

1850
01:13:47,865 --> 01:13:49,065
Who ordered there?

1851
01:13:49,065 --> 01:13:54,335
(They've been waiting to be called. Who ordered udon there?)

1852
01:13:54,835 --> 01:13:56,135
Is it Jae Seok?

1853
01:13:56,135 --> 01:13:58,505
(I ordered from there.)

1854
01:13:58,505 --> 01:13:59,705
- Did yours come out? - Is it yours?

1855
01:13:59,705 --> 01:14:01,265
- I'm so jealous. - Did it come out?

1856
01:14:01,265 --> 01:14:02,635
His food came out.

1857
01:14:02,635 --> 01:14:04,035
(Is it Jae Seok's dish?)

1858
01:14:04,035 --> 01:14:06,565
- Thank you very much. - Thank you.

1859
01:14:06,565 --> 01:14:07,765
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1860
01:14:07,765 --> 01:14:09,605
(It's vermicelli, not udon, but he's still 1st place.)

1861
01:14:09,605 --> 01:14:11,865
I'm happy. I'm so happy.

1862
01:14:11,865 --> 01:14:13,535
So Min's food came out.

1863
01:14:13,535 --> 01:14:14,935
It came out.

1864
01:14:14,935 --> 01:14:16,005
(She actually picked something good.)

1865
01:14:16,105 --> 01:14:18,035
Thank you very much.

1866
01:14:18,035 --> 01:14:20,405
(She comes in 2nd place with a warm steak.)

1867
01:14:20,735 --> 01:14:21,975
Something came out. What is it?

1868
01:14:22,405 --> 01:14:24,635
- This? - Thank you very much.

1869
01:14:25,405 --> 01:14:27,305
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1870
01:14:27,305 --> 01:14:29,305
(He won't lose this round.)

1871
01:14:29,735 --> 01:14:31,535
Soy sauce? Thank you.

1872
01:14:31,535 --> 01:14:35,365
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo are still waiting.)

1873
01:14:35,365 --> 01:14:38,805
(Where's Seok Jin's food that's supposed to take two minutes?)

1874
01:14:38,805 --> 01:14:44,735
(What about Kwang Soo who tried to communicate in Japanese?)

1875
01:14:44,735 --> 01:14:46,205
This is driving me nuts.

1876
01:14:46,335 --> 01:14:47,735
Hurry up, please.

1877
01:14:47,735 --> 01:14:49,335
(If your food comes out last, your name goes on the roulette.)

1878
01:14:49,335 --> 01:14:53,005
If your name gets picked, you'll be going to the Labyrinth alone.

1879
01:14:53,065 --> 01:14:55,905
The rest of you will be going in pairs.

1880
01:14:55,905 --> 01:14:59,235
(It's bad enough to go in pairs. Going by yourself is death.)

1881
01:14:59,235 --> 01:15:00,565
My goodness.

1882
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:05,535
Thank you.

1883
01:15:05,535 --> 01:15:07,765
(Seok Jin comes in 4th place with stir-fried udon.)

1884
01:15:07,765 --> 01:15:08,905
(He just spreads it.)

1885
01:15:08,905 --> 01:15:09,935
Thank you.

1886
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:13,305
(Thank you for the 2-minute udon.)

1887
01:15:14,935 --> 01:15:16,705
(4 of them get their meals.)

1888
01:15:16,705 --> 01:15:17,705
Did you get it?

1889
01:15:19,705 --> 01:15:20,935
What about Kwang Soo?

1890
01:15:20,935 --> 01:15:22,305
(His food is nowhere to be seen.)

1891
01:15:22,305 --> 01:15:23,905
Kwang Soo is the worst.

1892
01:15:23,905 --> 01:15:25,635
What did he order?

1893
01:15:25,635 --> 01:15:27,105
He can't help it.

1894
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:28,735
Why is his taking so long?

1895
01:15:28,735 --> 01:15:31,805
(Enjoy your meal.)

1896
01:15:31,805 --> 01:15:35,205
When I watch Kwang Soo, I get energized.

1897
01:15:35,205 --> 01:15:37,035
Of course. I'm not even joking.

1898
01:15:37,035 --> 01:15:39,165
Watching him gives you a lot of energy.

1899
01:15:39,165 --> 01:15:42,405
(Kwang Soo is unlucky but modest. He's a good role model.)

1900
01:15:42,765 --> 01:15:44,975
(Thank to his noodles, he loses.)

1901
01:15:44,975 --> 01:15:46,905
Is he coming?

1902
01:15:46,905 --> 01:15:48,665
It's not even something amazing. Why did it take so long?

1903
01:15:48,665 --> 01:15:50,265
- You ordered noodles. - It was noodles.

1904
01:15:50,265 --> 01:15:51,635
It was noodles.

1905
01:15:51,735 --> 01:15:54,365
- It looks good. - It's because I kept on talking.

1906
01:15:54,365 --> 01:15:56,105
- It looks really good. - Eat first.

1907
01:15:56,105 --> 01:15:57,235
(It's greasy.)

1908
01:15:57,235 --> 01:16:00,105
This is really good. Try it.

1909
01:16:00,435 --> 01:16:02,475
It's a rest stop, but their food is really good.

1910
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:03,935
(Before we cry, let's eat first.)

1911
01:16:03,935 --> 01:16:05,065
It's good.

1912
01:16:05,065 --> 01:16:06,305
- It's good, right? - Yes.

1913
01:16:06,305 --> 01:16:09,365
(This is a moment to relax before they go on the Dangerous Trip.)

1914
01:16:09,365 --> 01:16:10,505
Do you want to see it?

1915
01:16:10,635 --> 01:16:11,935
- It's so good. - Who ordered it?

1916
01:16:12,265 --> 01:16:13,565
Did you?

1917
01:16:13,565 --> 01:16:15,865
(It's still good.)

1918
01:16:16,165 --> 01:16:18,635
I'm happy you joined us because...

1919
01:16:19,035 --> 01:16:22,035
on Running Man, one of us always received the penalty.

1920
01:16:22,035 --> 01:16:23,065
Always?

1921
01:16:23,065 --> 01:16:24,435
Yes, it was strange.

1922
01:16:24,535 --> 01:16:26,975
- You two joined us. - Our chance of losing...

1923
01:16:26,975 --> 01:16:28,435
- went down significantly. - For sure.

1924
01:16:28,435 --> 01:16:30,665
- Welcome. - It would have been just us.

1925
01:16:30,805 --> 01:16:32,135
If you guys weren't here,

1926
01:16:32,135 --> 01:16:33,505
it would have been just us.

1927
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:34,805
- That's right. - It would be us again.

1928
01:16:34,805 --> 01:16:37,035
- That's how it's been. - It would have been us again.

1929
01:16:37,035 --> 01:16:38,235
- It's always been that. - Always?

1930
01:16:38,235 --> 01:16:39,405
It's always been that.

1931
01:16:39,405 --> 01:16:40,905
- It was always us in jail. - Exactly.

1932
01:16:40,905 --> 01:16:42,605
- It's always been like this. - That's right.

1933
01:16:42,605 --> 01:16:44,565
Since you joined us, there's been more of us.

1934
01:16:44,565 --> 01:16:46,805
Who's the worst from you three?

1935
01:16:47,505 --> 01:16:49,305
- Him. - You don't think it's yourselves.

1936
01:16:49,665 --> 01:16:50,835
- You didn't pick yourself. - It's not me.

1937
01:16:50,835 --> 01:16:52,505
- You should pick. - It's either one of them.

1938
01:16:52,635 --> 01:16:54,505
- I'm a bit better. - I don't agree.

1939
01:16:54,505 --> 01:16:56,065
- Kwang Soo just lost. - Right.

1940
01:16:56,365 --> 01:16:58,105
I'm filling up another space, right?

1941
01:16:58,105 --> 01:17:00,975
This round was for four spaces.

1942
01:17:01,565 --> 01:17:03,765
(Sorry? What did you say?)

1943
01:17:05,475 --> 01:17:07,805
(Kwang Soo takes up one-sixth of the roulette in this mission.)

1944
01:17:07,805 --> 01:17:09,205
Wasn't it one space?

1945
01:17:09,205 --> 01:17:11,475
- It was 4 spaces. - It was 4?

1946
01:17:11,905 --> 01:17:13,475
That was close.

1947
01:17:14,305 --> 01:17:16,235
You're done, Kwang Soo.

1948
01:17:17,365 --> 01:17:20,005
We have a lot of money left.

1949
01:17:20,005 --> 01:17:22,635
- That's right. - There are a lot of spaces left.

1950
01:17:22,635 --> 01:17:23,835
Okay.

1951
01:17:23,835 --> 01:17:24,935
(Kwang Soo: 5, Others: 1 each)

1952
01:17:25,405 --> 01:17:29,265
Everybody, it's a long way there, so please buy some snacks.

1953
01:17:29,475 --> 01:17:31,205
There are so many things.

1954
01:17:32,135 --> 01:17:33,765
It's dried fish.

1955
01:17:34,635 --> 01:17:35,665
Dried fish.

1956
01:17:35,665 --> 01:17:36,705
I'm going to buy it all.

1957
01:17:37,065 --> 01:17:38,605
This peanut cookie looks good.

1958
01:17:38,605 --> 01:17:41,935
It's a bracelet. I want it.

1959
01:17:42,635 --> 01:17:44,635
Is this expensive? It's a bracelet.

1960
01:17:44,635 --> 01:17:46,165
Look.

1961
01:17:46,165 --> 01:17:47,765
It's 1,200 yen.

1962
01:17:47,765 --> 01:17:49,535
- That's 12 dollars, right? - Isn't that what Do Yeon likes?

1963
01:17:49,535 --> 01:17:51,135
- Yes, it's 12 dollars. - It's expensive, right?

1964
01:17:51,135 --> 01:17:52,235
It's not.

1965
01:17:53,265 --> 01:17:55,005
Can you get this for me?

1966
01:17:55,665 --> 01:17:59,435
(She's scared of going into the Labyrinth,)

1967
01:17:59,435 --> 01:18:05,005
(so you should give her a gift.)

1968
01:18:05,005 --> 01:18:07,475
Stop talking rubbish.

1969
01:18:07,475 --> 01:18:09,105
(He bursts her bubble.)

1970
01:18:09,105 --> 01:18:10,635
- Don't try to pick a fight. - It's the chauffeur fee.

1971
01:18:10,635 --> 01:18:13,705
Why would you mention that now? That's so cheap of you.

1972
01:18:13,935 --> 01:18:15,365
I can get it for you...

1973
01:18:15,765 --> 01:18:16,935
Are you done?

1974
01:18:18,035 --> 01:18:20,405
(Fine, don't.)

1975
01:18:21,635 --> 01:18:24,005
(She walks away.)

1976
01:18:24,005 --> 01:18:27,505
(She leaves Kwang Soo and the bracelet.)

1977
01:18:27,505 --> 01:18:28,905
I'm just going to get this.

1978
01:18:29,835 --> 01:18:31,975
Should we buy one each, Kwang Soo?

1979
01:18:32,435 --> 01:18:35,105
- It's quite cute. - Right? It's cute.

1980
01:18:35,265 --> 01:18:37,735
Should we get it? Should we get one each?

1981
01:18:37,735 --> 01:18:39,305
It's cute, right? Which one do you want? I want this.

1982
01:18:39,305 --> 01:18:40,865
- I want this one. - This color?

1983
01:18:40,865 --> 01:18:42,505
- Should we get one each? - Okay.

1984
01:18:44,475 --> 01:18:45,805
Thank you very much.

1985
01:18:45,805 --> 01:18:48,705
(Kwang Soo is an impulsive buyer.)

1986
01:18:48,705 --> 01:18:49,805
Kwang Soo.

1987
01:18:50,705 --> 01:18:52,165
Aren't you spending too much?

1988
01:18:52,335 --> 01:18:54,405
I just bought them.

1989
01:18:55,235 --> 01:18:56,365
(He hands her something.)

1990
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:58,035
- Is that for her? - It's a bracelet.

1991
01:18:58,865 --> 01:19:02,005
(Here. I found it on the way.)

1992
01:19:02,565 --> 01:19:04,265
(Few minutes ago)

1993
01:19:06,165 --> 01:19:07,365
Let's go.

1994
01:19:07,365 --> 01:19:10,035
(He felt sorry for So Min because she wanted the bracelet,)

1995
01:19:10,035 --> 01:19:12,805
(so he picked it up when nobody was looking.)

1996
01:19:13,335 --> 01:19:15,535
Lee Kwang Soo.

1997
01:19:15,605 --> 01:19:16,665
Kwang Soo.

1998
01:19:16,665 --> 01:19:18,475
(What's going on? Is love in the air?)

1999
01:19:18,475 --> 01:19:19,905
Would you like water?

2000
01:19:20,235 --> 01:19:22,165
Jae Seok, Kwang Soo got this for me.

2001
01:19:22,165 --> 01:19:23,705
- What is it? - It's a bracelet.

2002
01:19:25,205 --> 01:19:26,905
(You're the best, Kwang Soo.)

2003
01:19:26,905 --> 01:19:28,935
You're awesome, Kwang Soo.

2004
01:19:29,475 --> 01:19:32,265
You're awesome. You're a true man.

2005
01:19:32,535 --> 01:19:35,205
(What's going on between them?)

2006
01:19:35,205 --> 01:19:37,265
- Here's dried fish. - Let's eat.

2007
01:19:37,265 --> 01:19:38,935
- Have some dried fish. - I bought the rice cake...

2008
01:19:38,935 --> 01:19:40,505
- because it looked good. - Dried fish looks good.

2009
01:19:40,505 --> 01:19:41,835
Can I have a small piece?

2010
01:19:42,735 --> 01:19:44,635
- This is enough. - Okay.

2011
01:19:44,635 --> 01:19:46,005
This is good.

2012
01:19:46,665 --> 01:19:49,205
- Hey, I just forgot. - What?

2013
01:19:49,305 --> 01:19:51,235
Where are we going again?

2014
01:19:51,235 --> 01:19:53,975
(They're on their way to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

2015
01:19:53,975 --> 01:19:55,405
Why did you mention it?

2016
01:19:56,165 --> 01:19:57,605
I was having a good time. Why did you say it?

2017
01:19:57,605 --> 01:19:59,135
We would have been happier if we didn't think about it.

2018
01:19:59,205 --> 01:20:00,935
Did you all get your snacks?

2019
01:20:00,935 --> 01:20:02,065
- Yes. - Yes.

2020
01:20:02,065 --> 01:20:05,065
Before you eat your snacks...

2021
01:20:05,765 --> 01:20:07,005
- So Min. - Yes?

2022
01:20:07,005 --> 01:20:09,305
Please give me the leftover change.

2023
01:20:09,635 --> 01:20:13,405
(Change?)

2024
01:20:13,865 --> 01:20:15,805
- Please give me the change. - Sorry?

2025
01:20:16,335 --> 01:20:17,335
Are you taking our money?

2026
01:20:17,335 --> 01:20:18,975
Everyone, please return your change.

2027
01:20:18,975 --> 01:20:20,205
- What are you doing? - Are you serious?

2028
01:20:20,205 --> 01:20:21,435
Is there a mission with the change?

2029
01:20:21,835 --> 01:20:23,005
Is there?

2030
01:20:23,135 --> 01:20:25,035
- Please give me the change. - I have a bad feeling about this.

2031
01:20:25,135 --> 01:20:27,135
Were we supposed to spend a lot or little?

2032
01:20:27,505 --> 01:20:29,265
I think we were supposed to spend a lot.

2033
01:20:29,665 --> 01:20:33,835
The person with the smallest change will get one more slot.

2034
01:20:33,835 --> 01:20:37,735
(This was a hidden mission at the rest stop.)

2035
01:20:41,475 --> 01:20:45,835
(We knew it. Kwang Soo will be selected.)

2036
01:20:46,765 --> 01:20:48,475
(Gosh, I want to curse at him.)

2037
01:20:48,475 --> 01:20:49,665
- It's Kwang Soo. - Hey.

2038
01:20:50,035 --> 01:20:52,065
- Isn't it definitely Kwang Soo? - Hey, here you go.

2039
01:20:52,065 --> 01:20:54,235
- Hold on. - Kwang Soo, it will be you.

2040
01:20:54,235 --> 01:20:56,735
- You spent a lot of money. - I couldn't spend a lot of money?

2041
01:20:56,735 --> 01:20:57,765
How can this be?

2042
01:20:57,975 --> 01:20:59,975
Why did you spend a lot of money?

2043
01:21:00,865 --> 01:21:01,975
Give me the bracelet money.

2044
01:21:02,835 --> 01:21:04,365
Come on. Pay me for that.

2045
01:21:04,835 --> 01:21:06,135
I didn't buy it for you.

2046
01:21:06,135 --> 01:21:08,865
- I didn't. - Why are you doing this now?

2047
01:21:08,865 --> 01:21:11,835
Kwang Soo, your change is 37 dollars.

2048
01:21:11,835 --> 01:21:13,605
(Kwang Soo is a big spender.)

2049
01:21:13,605 --> 01:21:15,335
- Goodness. - You squandered the money.

2050
01:21:15,335 --> 01:21:16,735
- Why did you buy the wallet? - I...

2051
01:21:16,735 --> 01:21:18,605
(It's a character-shaped wallet.)

2052
01:21:18,605 --> 01:21:20,205
- Why did you buy a wallet here? - Did you not?

2053
01:21:20,205 --> 01:21:21,265
I didn't. It was expensive.

2054
01:21:21,265 --> 01:21:23,265
(What are you talking about?)

2055
01:21:25,305 --> 01:21:26,475
I didn't. It was expensive.

2056
01:21:26,475 --> 01:21:27,735
- I was about to buy one too. - You little...

2057
01:21:27,735 --> 01:21:28,735
(You wanted to buy it together.)

2058
01:21:28,735 --> 01:21:30,475
Look at this guy. Hey!

2059
01:21:31,335 --> 01:21:32,765
- Are you serious? - He didn't buy it.

2060
01:21:32,765 --> 01:21:35,105
- It's not that. - Why did you buy a wallet here?

2061
01:21:35,105 --> 01:21:37,705
It was you who wanted a matching wallet. Hey!

2062
01:21:37,735 --> 01:21:40,435
Hey, Se Chan. Why are you doing this to me?

2063
01:21:40,435 --> 01:21:41,665
No, Kwang Soo.

2064
01:21:41,665 --> 01:21:44,265
- You didn't know about the mission. - I didn't know.

2065
01:21:45,235 --> 01:21:47,935
- Jae Seok's change is 84 dollars. - 84 dollars?

2066
01:21:47,935 --> 01:21:51,235
- Seok Jin's change is 56 dollars. - Yes!

2067
01:21:51,235 --> 01:21:53,735
- Se Chan's change is 76 dollars. - Okay!

2068
01:21:53,765 --> 01:21:54,835
I'm sorry.

2069
01:21:55,405 --> 01:21:56,505
But thank you for the bracelet.

2070
01:21:57,405 --> 01:21:58,605
Let's see what happens now.

2071
01:21:58,605 --> 01:21:59,975
I didn't know about this mission.

2072
01:21:59,975 --> 01:22:02,535
I have two snakes with me.

2073
01:22:03,265 --> 01:22:04,735
You sly, sly snakes.

2074
01:22:04,975 --> 01:22:06,135
You should write it yourself.

2075
01:22:06,135 --> 01:22:09,475
Write down your name. You spent the most amount of money.

2076
01:22:09,475 --> 01:22:11,035
(Sighing)

2077
01:22:11,475 --> 01:22:12,665
- Write it. - Hey.

2078
01:22:12,665 --> 01:22:14,505
Let's settle that Kwang Soo should fill in all the slots.

2079
01:22:14,505 --> 01:22:17,135
No, Jae Seok. Half of these slots are empty.

2080
01:22:17,865 --> 01:22:18,865
I can do this.

2081
01:22:18,865 --> 01:22:20,975
- He's really unlucky. - Kwang Soo.

2082
01:22:20,975 --> 01:22:23,065
(Kwang Soo has 6 slots on the roulette.)

2083
01:22:25,865 --> 01:22:29,205
Had I not been tricked by these two snakes,

2084
01:22:29,505 --> 01:22:31,935
it could have been Seok Jin. He ordered an expensive dish.

2085
01:22:31,935 --> 01:22:34,165
Right. I bought a lot. I spent about 50 dollars.

2086
01:22:34,165 --> 01:22:36,035
(Thanks to Kwang Soo, he was saved.)

2087
01:22:36,035 --> 01:22:38,665
You and So Min are developing your relationship.

2088
01:22:38,935 --> 01:22:41,235
Relationship? What relationship?

2089
01:22:41,235 --> 01:22:42,565
You are.

2090
01:22:42,605 --> 01:22:45,365
If you two get married and have a kid, that kid will be the best.

2091
01:22:45,405 --> 01:22:46,765
Your child will be the best traitor.

2092
01:22:46,765 --> 01:22:48,305
(They will be a pure-blooded traitor.)

2093
01:22:48,335 --> 01:22:49,835
(Kwang Soo and So Min will make the best traitor.)

2094
01:22:49,835 --> 01:22:52,565
- The best traitor. - Your child will make a new era.

2095
01:22:52,565 --> 01:22:54,635
Kwang Soo, your names are on six slots, right?

2096
01:22:55,475 --> 01:22:56,475
Each of us has only one slot.

2097
01:22:56,505 --> 01:22:58,565
You are Kwang Soo of Six Slots.

2098
01:22:58,565 --> 01:23:00,935
(Congratulations!)

2099
01:23:00,935 --> 01:23:02,565
- That's not my name. - Kwang Soo of Six Slots.

2100
01:23:02,565 --> 01:23:05,565
- You do have six slots. - Goodness, come on.

2101
01:23:05,565 --> 01:23:07,105
Let's see what happens at the end.

2102
01:23:08,475 --> 01:23:10,475
- Gosh. - I was happy for a brief moment.

2103
01:23:10,475 --> 01:23:13,265
It was brief. Now, I am feeling depressed again.

2104
01:23:13,265 --> 01:23:15,865
Exactly. When I think about it, it's depressing.

2105
01:23:15,865 --> 01:23:18,005
The members in Yokohama should be over the moon.

2106
01:23:18,105 --> 01:23:19,835
They don't have any burden pulling them back.

2107
01:23:20,035 --> 01:23:24,265
What are the members in Yokohama doing now?

2108
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:26,365
(They have a different fate under the same sky.)

2109
01:23:26,365 --> 01:23:29,565
It's been a while since I've been here. I have nothing to worry about.

2110
01:23:29,565 --> 01:23:32,265
If there's a punishment, there should be a reward.

2111
01:23:32,265 --> 01:23:35,035
- I'm at ease now. - But why do I feel anxious?

2112
01:23:35,235 --> 01:23:37,975
There's nothing to be anxious about. We have a credit card to have fun.

2113
01:23:37,975 --> 01:23:39,305
(It's because you are adding ghosts unknowingly.)

2114
01:23:40,035 --> 01:23:43,565
Sir, please drive us to the fanciest, coolest,

2115
01:23:44,035 --> 01:23:45,335
and best place.

2116
01:23:45,335 --> 01:23:47,365
- Okay. - All right.

2117
01:23:47,765 --> 01:23:49,305
By the way, are you Japanese?

2118
01:23:49,305 --> 01:23:51,065
No, I am Korean.

2119
01:23:51,105 --> 01:23:52,935
- You are Korean? - Are you Korean Japanese?

2120
01:23:53,035 --> 01:23:56,475
No, I am from Yeongju, North Gyeongsang Province.

2121
01:23:57,475 --> 01:23:58,475
I see.

2122
01:23:59,975 --> 01:24:04,135
(They start their trip that will raise the number of ghosts.)

2123
01:24:05,035 --> 01:24:08,365
(The scenery starts to look fancy after driving for 1 hour.)

2124
01:24:08,365 --> 01:24:11,035
(They arrive at Yokohama.)

2125
01:24:11,605 --> 01:24:14,135
(Welcome to Yokohama.)

2126
01:24:14,835 --> 01:24:15,865
(What is their first tourist attraction?)

2127
01:24:15,865 --> 01:24:17,335
Let's go!

2128
01:24:17,735 --> 01:24:19,535
- Let's go. - Goodness.

2129
01:24:20,365 --> 01:24:21,435
This is amazing.

2130
01:24:22,135 --> 01:24:23,805
This is crazy.

2131
01:24:24,035 --> 01:24:25,405
This is so pretty.

2132
01:24:25,405 --> 01:24:27,065
What a spectacular view.

2133
01:24:27,065 --> 01:24:28,165
(Yokohama is a romantic, port city.)

2134
01:24:29,335 --> 01:24:31,735
(Oh, yes! I love this trip.)

2135
01:24:33,805 --> 01:24:34,975
Hey, this is it.

2136
01:24:35,305 --> 01:24:38,535
This is the Yokohama Landmark Tower.

2137
01:24:38,935 --> 01:24:41,975
We have to take a selfie from below. Jong Kook, come closer.

2138
01:24:42,305 --> 01:24:43,305
This is incredible.

2139
01:24:43,305 --> 01:24:44,335
(They seem relaxed.)

2140
01:24:44,335 --> 01:24:45,605
In 2, 3.

2141
01:24:45,865 --> 01:24:48,365
(Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear? Not for us.)

2142
01:24:49,265 --> 01:24:50,265
Jong Kook.

2143
01:24:50,265 --> 01:24:51,935
(Their second tourist attraction is a famous ramen restaurant.)

2144
01:24:53,035 --> 01:24:54,935
(Will you be able to enjoy ramen like we do?)

2145
01:24:56,035 --> 01:24:57,065
It's here.

2146
01:24:57,865 --> 01:24:59,035
- Thank you. - Gosh.

2147
01:24:59,235 --> 01:25:00,235
Look at this.

2148
01:25:00,235 --> 01:25:03,365
(This is a Japanese ramen meal that even the ghosts will be envious of.)

2149
01:25:03,365 --> 01:25:05,305
- This looks so delicious. - Let's eat.

2150
01:25:05,305 --> 01:25:06,305
(This is a Japanese ramen meal that even the ghosts will be envious of.)

2151
01:25:07,665 --> 01:25:10,535
- Look at the egg. - This is amazing.

2152
01:25:11,365 --> 01:25:12,765
This is incredible.

2153
01:25:12,765 --> 01:25:15,035
(The more food they order, the more ghosts will be added.)

2154
01:25:16,105 --> 01:25:17,565
(Look at this.)

2155
01:25:17,565 --> 01:25:18,865
(He takes a big bite.)

2156
01:25:22,265 --> 01:25:23,435
Why is this so delicious?

2157
01:25:24,475 --> 01:25:26,165
- This is so tasty. - Jong Kook, they are calling us.

2158
01:25:26,735 --> 01:25:27,975
(Vibrating)

2159
01:25:28,035 --> 01:25:29,205
Jong Kook, they are calling us.

2160
01:25:29,405 --> 01:25:30,475
Answer it.

2161
01:25:30,665 --> 01:25:32,135
(Why are they calling us?)

2162
01:25:32,135 --> 01:25:33,605
- Everyone. - Yes?

2163
01:25:33,665 --> 01:25:34,865
- Here's the second mission. - Here he goes again.

2164
01:25:34,865 --> 01:25:36,765
- Okay. - There's another one?

2165
01:25:36,765 --> 01:25:39,865
Four slots on the roulette are at stake with this mission.

2166
01:25:40,765 --> 01:25:42,165
- Four slots? - If I fail again, I'm done.

2167
01:25:42,165 --> 01:25:45,765
This mission is called Your Name.

2168
01:25:45,765 --> 01:25:48,105
(Your Name is the next mission.)

2169
01:25:48,605 --> 01:25:52,165
You will call the members in Yokohama,

2170
01:25:52,205 --> 01:25:54,975
and the first name they say will be written on the roulette.

2171
01:25:54,975 --> 01:25:56,835
(The member whose name is called first will earn 4 slots.)

2172
01:25:56,835 --> 01:25:59,365
(The caller and the receiver hold the key to the mission.)

2173
01:25:59,365 --> 01:26:00,665
- What do we ask them? - Who will make the call?

2174
01:26:00,665 --> 01:26:03,705
Do rock-paper-scissors and anyone can make the call.

2175
01:26:03,975 --> 01:26:06,365
When they pick up and say, "Kwang Soo?" Then Kwang Soo is picked.

2176
01:26:06,365 --> 01:26:07,365
Goodness.

2177
01:26:07,475 --> 01:26:10,365
- It doesn't matter what I say then? - Avoiding this gives you a chance.

2178
01:26:10,365 --> 01:26:12,865
- If we avoid that first answer... - You're right.

2179
01:26:13,335 --> 01:26:15,365
We can say, "Who is that tall member?"

2180
01:26:15,475 --> 01:26:16,565
- "You know him." - "Kwang Soo"?

2181
01:26:16,565 --> 01:26:17,835
When they say that, it's over.

2182
01:26:17,835 --> 01:26:19,505
- All right. - Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

2183
01:26:19,505 --> 01:26:21,735
(Not calling the members is the best way to go.)

2184
01:26:22,105 --> 01:26:24,565
(I have to win rock-paper-scissors and avoid becoming the caller.)

2185
01:26:24,565 --> 01:26:25,605
Four slots are at stake.

2186
01:26:25,605 --> 01:26:26,605
(I have to win rock-paper-scissors and avoid becoming the caller.)

2187
01:26:27,565 --> 01:26:29,105
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2188
01:26:29,435 --> 01:26:30,705
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2189
01:26:30,865 --> 01:26:32,065
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2190
01:26:32,065 --> 01:26:34,235
(Kwang Soo loses.)

2191
01:26:34,235 --> 01:26:35,505
(Screaming)

2192
01:26:35,505 --> 01:26:37,105
- You lost, Kwang Soo. - Hold on.

2193
01:26:37,105 --> 01:26:38,105
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2194
01:26:39,505 --> 01:26:40,505
(What are you doing?)

2195
01:26:40,505 --> 01:26:42,565
Hold on. The loser...

2196
01:26:42,565 --> 01:26:43,565
(Oh, no. I lost again.)

2197
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:44,565
Wait.

2198
01:26:44,565 --> 01:26:46,505
Kwang Soo, I think you've been possessed.

2199
01:26:46,505 --> 01:26:48,265
- Everyone played paper except you. - Hey, you.

2200
01:26:48,265 --> 01:26:50,235
- You are possessed. - How can this be possible?

2201
01:26:50,235 --> 01:26:52,605
- I can't believe you. - Kwang Soo, you are incredible.

2202
01:26:52,605 --> 01:26:54,665
Hey, you should perform an exorcism.

2203
01:26:54,665 --> 01:26:56,605
- How can this be possible? - Fine. I'll make the call.

2204
01:26:56,605 --> 01:26:57,605
(Kwang Soo is chosen.)

2205
01:26:57,605 --> 01:26:58,605
Whom are you going to call?

2206
01:26:58,605 --> 01:27:00,665
When they say, "Hey, Kwang Soo," it'll all be over.

2207
01:27:00,935 --> 01:27:02,365
No way. I don't think they will answer.

2208
01:27:02,365 --> 01:27:03,965
- It's up to you. - I'll call Haha.

2209
01:27:03,965 --> 01:27:05,565
- All right. - I'll call Haha.

2210
01:27:05,565 --> 01:27:07,435
Hey, say that we are playing a game.

2211
01:27:07,465 --> 01:27:09,765
Ask him, "Who is the grasshopper?"

2212
01:27:10,305 --> 01:27:11,865
I think he's going to say your name.

2213
01:27:11,865 --> 01:27:14,505
(He's calls Haha.)

2214
01:27:14,505 --> 01:27:18,165
(Haha, please don't call my name.)

2215
01:27:18,165 --> 01:27:21,465
(Just say, "Hello?" It's nice and simple.)

2216
01:27:21,465 --> 01:27:23,035
Hey, Kwang Soo.

2217
01:27:23,035 --> 01:27:24,335
(Haha calls his name immediately.)

2218
01:27:26,205 --> 01:27:28,835
(What is it, Kwang Soo?)

2219
01:27:29,305 --> 01:27:30,465
We were right.

2220
01:27:30,565 --> 01:27:33,765
(Haha, clueless of their mission, was gobbling up ramen.)

2221
01:27:33,765 --> 01:27:34,765
It's Kwang Soo.

2222
01:27:35,605 --> 01:27:36,605
Hey, Kwang Soo.

2223
01:27:37,065 --> 01:27:40,035
(Due to Haha's nonchalant greeting, "Kwang Soo",)

2224
01:27:40,035 --> 01:27:43,235
(Kwang Soo earns 4 slots on the roulette.)

2225
01:27:43,835 --> 01:27:44,835
That's it.

2226
01:27:44,835 --> 01:27:46,665
(His misfortune is praiseworthy and impressive.)

2227
01:27:46,665 --> 01:27:47,665
Kwang Soo.

2228
01:27:47,665 --> 01:27:48,665
(His misfortune is praiseworthy and impressive.)

2229
01:27:50,165 --> 01:27:51,835
Nice job, Haha.

2230
01:27:51,835 --> 01:27:53,905
- Kwang Soo, just hang up. - Haha.

2231
01:27:54,465 --> 01:27:55,765
Kwang Soo, why are you laughing?

2232
01:27:56,665 --> 01:27:57,665
- Haha. - Haha.

2233
01:27:58,405 --> 01:28:00,205
- Yes, Kwang Soo. - That's enough!

2234
01:28:01,035 --> 01:28:02,665
Come on. Cut it out.

2235
01:28:03,205 --> 01:28:05,865
(I am about to go to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear by myself.)

2236
01:28:06,365 --> 01:28:07,765
- Hey. - Kwang Soo, what's wrong?

2237
01:28:07,765 --> 01:28:08,765
(Goodness)

2238
01:28:09,105 --> 01:28:11,035
- Kwang Soo. - What's wrong?

2239
01:28:11,035 --> 01:28:12,665
I'm sorry, Haha.

2240
01:28:12,665 --> 01:28:15,835
- Where are you guys? - Haha, did you arrive in Yokohama?

2241
01:28:16,165 --> 01:28:18,365
Yes, we did. We're having ramen now.

2242
01:28:18,365 --> 01:28:20,335
- Gosh, it must be delicious. - That sounds tasty.

2243
01:28:20,335 --> 01:28:22,565
- Sorry. I don't know what it is. - Kwang Soo, just enjoy it.

2244
01:28:23,365 --> 01:28:24,665
You'll feel sorry when you watch this on TV.

2245
01:28:24,665 --> 01:28:27,035
- All right, Haha. - That's it.

2246
01:28:27,035 --> 01:28:29,305
- Kwang Soo got 4 slots. - 4 more slots.

2247
01:28:29,305 --> 01:28:30,865
- 1, 2... - He has 10 slots.

2248
01:28:30,865 --> 01:28:32,835
- Kwang Soo of 10 Slots! - 10 slots!

2249
01:28:32,835 --> 01:28:34,465
- I have 10 slots? - He has 10 slots.

2250
01:28:34,465 --> 01:28:35,765
- Kwang Soo has 10 slots! - Already?

2251
01:28:35,765 --> 01:28:38,205
Thank you so much.

2252
01:28:38,205 --> 01:28:42,035
- Kwang Soo has now 10 slots, not 6. - 10 slots!

2253
01:28:42,035 --> 01:28:43,335
10 slots!

2254
01:28:43,435 --> 01:28:45,965
Why did you write my name all on one side?

2255
01:28:46,035 --> 01:28:47,665
We didn't have much space.

2256
01:28:47,665 --> 01:28:49,505
- If you do this... - All the slots have your name!

2257
01:28:50,035 --> 01:28:51,335
- 10 slots. - We had no other place.

2258
01:28:51,365 --> 01:28:52,365
Kwang Soo, let it go.

2259
01:28:52,365 --> 01:28:54,505
- That mission was out of my hands. - When I am with Kwang Soo,

2260
01:28:54,505 --> 01:28:56,765
- I am so lucky. - So am I.

2261
01:28:56,765 --> 01:28:58,835
- Me too. - I am so lucky.

2262
01:28:58,835 --> 01:29:00,865
- He doesn't let me shine. - Let's do this.

2263
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:02,305
- This is amazing. - Don't do this.

2264
01:29:02,305 --> 01:29:03,835
- By the way... - This is enough.

2265
01:29:03,835 --> 01:29:07,135
- This isn't just luck now. - He's possessed by other spirits.

2266
01:29:07,335 --> 01:29:09,035
I think he's been possessed by an evil spirit.

2267
01:29:09,035 --> 01:29:10,205
An evil spirit?

2268
01:29:10,205 --> 01:29:11,565
- Jae Seok. - How can you say such a thing?

2269
01:29:11,565 --> 01:29:13,905
- You should have an exorcism. - Why would I do that?

2270
01:29:13,935 --> 01:29:15,565
- If you are this unlucky... - You should perform one.

2271
01:29:15,565 --> 01:29:17,135
How can this happen consecutively?

2272
01:29:17,135 --> 01:29:20,235
- I will show you I'm normal. - Why did you buy this Dotoro?

2273
01:29:20,235 --> 01:29:22,235
Why did you buy this Dotoro?

2274
01:29:22,465 --> 01:29:23,865
- Dotoro? - This is Totoro.

2275
01:29:23,865 --> 01:29:26,305
- How can you call it Dotoro? - You were...

2276
01:29:26,305 --> 01:29:28,705
- You were so lame. - He said you were lame.

2277
01:29:29,335 --> 01:29:31,635
- I really think he's possessed. - Why did you play rock alone?

2278
01:29:31,935 --> 01:29:34,365
Why did you have to call Haha?

2279
01:29:34,365 --> 01:29:35,365
I agree.

2280
01:29:35,365 --> 01:29:37,835
- Japan must want Kwang Soo. - I think so too.

2281
01:29:37,835 --> 01:29:39,505
- Hey. - Kwang Soo.

2282
01:29:39,865 --> 01:29:42,505
What's the matter with you? Just watch.

2283
01:29:43,135 --> 01:29:45,505
Kwang Soo, please cheer up

2284
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:46,865
- Don't sing that song. - You have

2285
01:29:46,865 --> 01:29:49,605
- You have ghosts - Us

2286
01:29:49,605 --> 01:29:50,835
- Just watch. - Kwang Soo of 10 Slots

2287
01:29:50,835 --> 01:29:52,405
Please cheer up

2288
01:29:52,405 --> 01:29:55,035
- You have ghosts - You have us

2289
01:29:55,035 --> 01:29:57,665
You can do it, Kwang Soo of 11, 12, and 13 Slots!

2290
01:29:58,735 --> 01:30:00,605
- What's the name of the song? - Kwang Soo, this song is for you.

2291
01:30:00,605 --> 01:30:01,605
What is it?

2292
01:30:01,605 --> 01:30:03,235
- It's "Amor Fati". - "Amor Fati".

2293
01:30:03,665 --> 01:30:05,365
(This is how life is)

2294
01:30:05,365 --> 01:30:06,765
(Isn't it?)

2295
01:30:07,835 --> 01:30:12,135
(DJ Yu decides to play a list of dedicated songs.)

2296
01:30:13,265 --> 01:30:14,735
Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear, baby

2297
01:30:15,665 --> 01:30:17,365
Kwang Soo will go alone, baby

2298
01:30:17,665 --> 01:30:21,435
I love it, I love it, I love it, Kwang Soo of 10 Slots

2299
01:30:21,665 --> 01:30:24,805
(I want everyone to just shut it.)

2300
01:30:25,165 --> 01:30:26,865
(Kwang Soo of 10 Slots, Kwang Soo of 10 Slots)

2301
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:29,965
(There is a 99 percent chance Kwang Soo will go alone.)

2302
01:30:29,965 --> 01:30:31,705
(He is the top 1 candidate.)

2303
01:30:31,705 --> 01:30:33,605
Why would you sway the camera?

2304
01:30:33,605 --> 01:30:34,935
(Do you think you are filming "Inkigayo"?)

2306

(Please don't be sad, Kwang Soo of 10 Slots.)

2307
01:30:38,835 --> 01:30:40,565
Kwang Soo of 10 Slots, Kwang Soo of 10 Slots!

2308
01:30:40,565 --> 01:30:42,435
Your face is divine

2309
01:30:43,205 --> 01:30:44,665
(I give up.)

2310
01:30:44,665 --> 01:30:45,765
All right.

2311
01:30:49,105 --> 01:30:51,235
What is going on? Turn on the light.

2312
01:30:51,235 --> 01:30:53,105
(They enter the tunnel as soon as he begins to dance.)

2313
01:30:53,105 --> 01:30:54,265
Lee Kwang Soo!

2314
01:30:54,265 --> 01:30:56,905
(Dancing without restraints)

2315
01:30:57,135 --> 01:31:00,135
You will end up at Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear

2316
01:31:00,305 --> 01:31:03,135
("Oh, My Kwang Soo of 10 Slots" by Country Kkokko)

2317
01:31:03,135 --> 01:31:06,635
Will you go to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear alone?

2318
01:31:07,535 --> 01:31:10,535
(So Min teases Kwang Soo.)

2319
01:31:10,535 --> 01:31:14,165
(I say Kwang Soo, you say Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

2320
01:31:14,935 --> 01:31:17,835
- We are forgetting something. - What?

2321
01:31:18,035 --> 01:31:20,235
We are acting as if we're not going there.

2322
01:31:20,905 --> 01:31:23,135
- Seriously. - We will go with him.

2323
01:31:23,135 --> 01:31:24,935
- It's not like I am going alone. - The music made me forgot.

2324
01:31:24,935 --> 01:31:27,135
We either go in alone or with someone else.

2325
01:31:27,135 --> 01:31:28,505
I don't think I can go in alone.

2326
01:31:28,505 --> 01:31:30,005
That ruined my mood.

2327
01:31:30,005 --> 01:31:33,005
We will pee our pants together in a few hours.

2328
01:31:33,005 --> 01:31:35,365
(We are all in the same boat.)

2329
01:31:35,565 --> 01:31:37,365
(After a while, they arrive at a restaurant near Mount Fuji.)

2330
01:31:37,365 --> 01:31:40,665
(The candidates fill the roulette with their names.)

2331
01:31:40,665 --> 01:31:43,305
(Will another candidate rise as the most likely to be chosen?)

2332
01:31:43,305 --> 01:31:46,305
(Who will have the highest chance of entering the attraction alone?)

2333
01:31:47,065 --> 01:31:48,105
(Night falls.)

2334
01:31:48,105 --> 01:31:52,735
- I feel down now that it's night. - I'm lethargic.

2335
01:31:53,605 --> 01:31:55,065
I shouldn't drink water.

2336
01:31:55,065 --> 01:31:56,765
If I drink water, I will end up going to the bathroom.

2337
01:31:56,765 --> 01:31:58,065
(The van arrives at the entrance of Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

2338
01:31:58,165 --> 01:31:59,305
There is no bathroom.

2339
01:31:59,405 --> 01:32:01,705
- I am going crazy. - I don't want to pee my pants.

2340
01:32:02,735 --> 01:32:05,235
- I am going crazy. - I heard it's really scary.

2341
01:32:06,035 --> 01:32:07,235
We are going.

2342
01:32:07,405 --> 01:32:08,405
- Are we going? - Are we going?

2343
01:32:08,405 --> 01:32:10,705
That's where they hold the memorial rites.

2344
01:32:10,705 --> 01:32:12,105
They hold one every morning?

2345
01:32:12,105 --> 01:32:13,505
My goodness.

2346
01:32:14,235 --> 01:32:16,365
Why do they hold a memorial rite every morning?

2347
01:32:16,635 --> 01:32:18,535
Why do they hold a memorial rite every morning?

2348
01:32:18,535 --> 01:32:19,935
(They enter Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

2349
01:32:20,065 --> 01:32:23,005
This is where they hold the memorial rites.

2350
01:32:23,165 --> 01:32:25,405
- Why do they do it? - The buildings are apart.

2351
01:32:25,405 --> 01:32:26,635
My goodness.

2352
01:32:26,905 --> 01:32:29,405
- It's so scary. - The place looks frightening.

2353
01:32:30,065 --> 01:32:33,005
- I am so scared. - This isn't a set.

2354
01:32:34,035 --> 01:32:36,605
We will decide on the member...

2355
01:32:36,605 --> 01:32:39,135
- who will enter alone. - I'm about to die.

2356
01:32:39,435 --> 01:32:44,405
(Will it be Kwang Soo of 10 Slots or someone else?)

2357
01:32:44,965 --> 01:32:47,035

01:32:54,265 --> 01:32:55,505
(Fear wraps around their skin.)

2361
01:32:55,935 --> 01:32:58,565
(They must find their name tags and escape from the pit.)

2362
01:32:58,565 --> 01:33:01,465
(What will they face at the end of darkness?)

2363
01:33:01,765 --> 01:33:04,765
(Who will enter the pit alone?)

2364
01:33:05,605 --> 01:33:07,135
Sir, please.

2365
01:33:07,335 --> 01:33:08,605
Please move back a little.
