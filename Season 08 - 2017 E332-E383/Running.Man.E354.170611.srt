1
00:00:05,783 --> 00:00:08,713
(2017 Running Man's Global Project)

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,190
(Dangerous Trip Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear)

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,090
(6 members were chosen to go to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,560
(Running Man goes to Russia and Mongolia.)

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,550
(Team Mongolia must meet the nomads and milk their sheep.)

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,920
There is no milk.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,550
(Team Mongolia fails the mission.)

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,720
(Team Russia must catch 10 types of seafood and king crab.)

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,190
(They catch 10 types of seafood and a small crab.)

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,920
(1 member can be exempted.)

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,790
(Haha is exempted from the trip to Japan.)

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,990
(Jong Kook, Haha, and Ji Hyo go to Yokohama.)

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,890
(They eat delicious food without knowing anything.)

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,820
(However)

15
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,720
(Based on Team Happy Trip's expenses, number of ghosts rises.)

16
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,490
(One member must enter the labyrinth alone.)

17
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,150
(Select a person who will go alone.)

18
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:04,420
(When one fails the mission, the name is added to the roulette.)

19
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,120
(Kwang Soo's name gets written on the roulette.)

20
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,690
(Kwang Soo's name takes 6 slots on the roulette.)

21
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,420
(Kwang Soo's consecutive failure fills up the roulette.)

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,420
(Fun times are over.)

23
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,720
(Finally, )

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,220
(they enter the labyrinth.)

25
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,790
(It's time to face the fear that makes your skin crawl.)

26
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,750
(Find the name tag and escape Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

27
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,720
(Which 1 of the 5 members will enter the labyrinth alone?)

28
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,620
We've only been on the freeway and rest stops in Japan.

29
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,220
- It doesn't feel like Japan. - I'm so bored.

30
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,420
It's So Min's first time in Tokyo, but she didn't get to see any of it.

31
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,420
Is this Tokyo?

32
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,350
- Yes. - Is this how it is?

33
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,620
Doesn't it seem like Gyeongbu Expressway towards Anseong?

34
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,190
It does.

35
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,050
Isn't Tokyo fancy and full of skyscrapers?

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,690
Are we moving away from Tokyo?

37
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:01,920
That's correct.

38
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,820
Will we get to see Tokyo Tower?

39
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,290
- No. - That's impossible.

40
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,020
We'll only visit the unprecedented labyrinth.

41
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,920
It's called Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.

42
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,650
It doesn't matter.

43
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,420
I got used to calling it by that name.

44
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,090
(They travel to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

45
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,620
(They arrive in Yamanashi Prefecture.)

46
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,690
It's Mount Fuji.

47
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,420
- Can you see it? - That's amazing.

48
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,420
Look at that.

49
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,390
- That must be it. - It looks beautiful.

50
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,520
- That's Mount Fuji. - I haven't seen it before.

51
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,550
Is that snow on top?

52
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,720
It's permanent snow.

53
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,520
I didn't expect a mountain to be so beautiful.

54
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,820
(They must be near.)

55
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,390
I think we're almost there.

56
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,190
We get another mission when we arrive,

57
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,520
right?

58
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,990
(His name takes most of the roulette.)

59
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,120
Don't look forward to it.

60
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,350
Can I bring it to use it?

61
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,350
(Stay tuned.)

62
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,890
(Becoming a ghost after eating)

63
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,990
- It's beautiful. - It's amazing.

64
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,820
- It's beautiful. - It's incredible.

65
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,020
(They arrive at a restaurant to enjoy their last meal.)

66
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,290
As long as I avoid this time...

67
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,090
The person who gets picked will be it.

68
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,220
(What's the last mission?)

69
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,220
How about So Min?

70
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,750
It'll be fun if So Min gets picked.

71
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,390
How could you say that, Seok Jin?

72
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,420
All of you are so cruel.

73
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,150
It's only my hope.

74
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,550
We don't know what will happen.

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,190
Aren't I free to think what I want?

76
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,720
(He's being sensitive.)

77
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,390
Are you okay?

78
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,850
- Are you okay? - Stop pitying me. I'm fine.

79
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,350
- I'm okay. - You aren't angry, are you?

80
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,350
Give us the mission.

81
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,150
Everyone is getting sensitive as the time draws near.

82
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,420
That's true.

83
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,420
(The 5 members are getting very sensitive.)

84
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,190
(Which unlucky member will enter the labyrinth alone?)

85
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,750
Everyone.

86
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,290
This is the last stop before Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.

87
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,620
It's a houtou restaurant where you get recharge.

88
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,190
It's similar to sujebi.

89
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,620
This is the last mission to determine the teams.

90
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,620
Okay.

91
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,350
It's on 10 slots of the roulette.

92
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,090
(10 roulette slots)

93
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,020
(10 roulette slots?)

94
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,120
Is it 10 slots per person?

95
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
Is it 10 slots per person?

96
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,150
It's 10 slots per person.

97
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,390
(This is the last mission.)

98
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,250
(Who will be the 2nd member of 10 slots?)

99
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,020
Let's go for Kwang Soo of 20 slots.

100
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,550
(She's very excited.)

101
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,920
Will it be Kwang Soo of 10 or 20 slots?

102
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,020
It can't be 10 slots.

103
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,850
Will it be 10 or 20?

104
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,920
The third mission is called...

105
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,450
Your Pass.

106
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,150
(The third mission is Your Pass.)

107
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,790
(Your Pass?)

108
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,790
You'll be given a total of four missions.

109
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,750
You pass every time you clear a mission.

110
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,450
(The one who passes survives.)

111
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,420
The last member to remain will come last.

112
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,520
(The last member to remain will be sacrificed.)

113
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,620
Here's the first mission.

114
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,190
We ordered three types of houtou.

115
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,420
This is the first mission.

116
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,990
The person closest to the dish that's served first passes.

117
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,320
(The person closest to the dish?)

118
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,920
- Kwang Soo has an advantage. - The food is usually...

119
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,020
served from the corner.

120
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,390
They could serve it at the center.

121
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,450
It's at the center.

122
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,090
Do we have to remain quiet?

123
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,750
This seat is advantageous.

124
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,120
Can we sit however we want?

125
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,720
(Can we sit however we want?)

126
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,090
(He points toward him.)

127
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,920
- It'll be the center. - You should stay still.

128
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,620
The food is served at the center.

129
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,120
I want that seat.

130
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,890
Does anyone want to switch seats?

131
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,090
Does anyone want to switch seats?

132
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,720
I want to switch with Jae Seok.

133
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,320
I want his seat too.

134
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,890
That seat is the best.

135
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,150
Shall I switch?

136
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:32,390
(Considering feng shui...)

137
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,020
Do you want to switch, Seok Jin?

138
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,220
(Do you want to switch?)

139
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,320
If I were Seok Jin, I would.

140
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,590
I would too.

141
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,790
- Deal! - Really?

142
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,350
(They change seats.)

143
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,290
(Seok Jin sits at the innermost side and Jae Seok sits at the center.)

144
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,990
Be careful not to drop the spoons.

145
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,920
It's coming.

146
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,520
(Houtou is on its way.)

147
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,920
- It's here. Everyone be quiet. - Stay still.

148
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,220
- Put your hand down. - Put it down.

149
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,320
(Who will be the first lucky member?)

150
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,450
You'll be exempted if you're sitting the closest to the first dish.

151
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,450
- Can I come in? - Sure.

152
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,490
(She wonders where to put the dish.)

153
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,950
(After a mysterious hand gesture, )

154
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,620
(she walks toward the innermost side.)

155
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,490
(She walks past Jae Seok, who's sitting in the center.)

156
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,650
- Excuse me. - Excuse me.

157
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,620
Well...

158
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,290
- Wait. - Excuse me.

159
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,220
- Why... - Be quiet already.

160
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,190
- Go ahead. - Everyone be quiet.

161
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,050
Thank you.

162
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,420
(The first dish is placed right in front of Seok Jin.)

163
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,050
I knew it.

164
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,590
(That was my seat a while ago.)

165
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,350
(Thank you, ma'am.)

166
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,750
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

167
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,450
(Seok Jin clears the mission.)

168
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,890
- Jae Seok, I was right. - Why did you change seats?

169
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,550
- Awesome. - I see you're getting irritated.

170
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,120
- Goodness. - Seok Jin's the first to clear it.

171
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,790
She didn't even look at Kwang Soo's side.

172
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,490
She didn't.

173
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,520
We'll move right onto the second mission.

174
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,150
- What is it? - Here it comes.

175
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,250
It's the mission for the rest.

176
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,590
The three orders of houtou have different meat inside.

177
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,250
- It's pork in the middle. - It has pork inside.

178
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,890
The one in front of Jae Seok has boar meat inside.

179
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,450
- It has boar inside? - Boar meat?

180
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,250
What kind of meat does the one in front of Seok Jin have?

181
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,250
Each of you will get a chance to speak.

182
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,520
- Can I take a look? - Shall I show them?

183
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,550
- Go ahead. - Show us.

184
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,550
- It's this. - What is that?

185
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:29,050
(It looks unfamiliar.)

186
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,890
(What on earth is that?)

187
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,750
- Isn't it fish? - No, it's not.

188
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,790
- I've never seen that before. - It looks strange.

189
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:42,350
(It has a big chunk of meat stuck to a tiny bone.)

190
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,650
- I think I know. - Jae Seok!

191
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,750
Go ahead.

192
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,890
It's Silkie.

193
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:52,520
(Jae Seok's guess is Silkie.)

194
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,650
Wrong!

195
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,220
- So Min! - I know the answer.

196
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,320
Who will guess first between you two?

197
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,950
- So Min said it first. - So Min, go ahead.

198
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,490
Hold on.

199
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,250
- So Min said it first. - So Min, go ahead.

200
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,550
Hold on.

201
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,620
(He's suspicious of biased judgement.)

202
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,990
- Hold on. - Let's do it from the start then.

203
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,720
- So Min was faster. - It's obvious I said it first.

204
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,820
- You can't do this on purpose. - So Min was faster.

205
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,250
You have to shout your name to guess the answer.

206
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,620
- It's to make it less confusing. - He's right.

207
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,420
So Min.

208
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,120
I think it's chicken.

209
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,090
Her guess is...

210
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,650
wrong.

211
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,790
Kwang Soo.

212
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,890
(It's finally my turn.)

213
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,050
Kwang Soo.

214
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,250
- It looks unfamiliar. - I've never seen it before.

215
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,920
- Isn't it fish? - No, it's not.

216
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,690
- I've never seen that before. - It looks strange.

217
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,720
(Judging by its tiny bone...)

218
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,290
- It's duck! - Duck?

219
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,750
(It may be duck meat!)

220
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,850
(Will desperate Kwang Soo guess it right?)

221
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,160
- It's duck! - Duck? It's wrong.

222
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,690
- So Min. - It's my turn now.

223
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,990
- Right, Se Chan. - Okay.

224
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,120
What is that?

225
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,850
- It's pheasant. - I think he's right.

226
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,120
It's wrong.

227
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,250
- Jae Seok! - So Min!

228
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,290
Jae Seok.

229
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,390
Maybe it's soft-shelled turtle.

230
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,990
(It looks similar to yongbongtang.)

231
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,290
(Is it soft-shelled turtle that's good for regaining your health?)

232
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,590
Maybe it's soft-shelled turtle.

233
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,220
- Soft-shelled turtle? - I don't think so.

234
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,250
It's soft-shelled turtle.

235
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,320
That's correct.

236
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,820
How did you know?

237
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,160
(Jae Seok's answer is correct.)

238
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,820
(It's soft-shelled turtle!)

239
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,390
- My goodness. - I can't eat this then.

240
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,620
My goodness.

241
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,920
- My gosh. - What made you think so?

242
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,250
I took a closer look...

243
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,250
and saw its arm.

244
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,750
(Shocked)

245
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,950
(He found its biceps.)

246
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,090
Are you serious?

247
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,450
(It's been a precious food ingredient since the past.)

248
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,620
- Really? - It's really soft-shelled turtle?

249
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,120
- But it's expensive. - Is that the arm?

250
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,850
- Look over there. - I can't believe you found that.

251
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,020
- How did you find that? - It's hard even knowing the answer.

252
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,590
- It's one of the most famous menus. - Really?

253
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,850
- I've never seen it before. - My gosh.

254
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,620
- Is this place famous? - It is.

255
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,050
It was sold out before we arrived at this restaurant,

256
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,890
but they have bear and fox meat as well.

257
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,120
- Fox meat? - Yes.

258
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,420
Anyway, I'm out.

259
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,420
(Jae Seok clears the second mission.)

260
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,520
(Joyful)

261
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,720
It's so annoying to see him like this.

262
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,350
(I get to avoid writing my name 10 times in the roulette.)

263
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,420
I was going to say it was crow meat.

264
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,550
Things are moving toward writing 20 of Kwang Soo's name.

265
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,720
(There are 3 people left with 2 more missions.)

266
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,090
Only the three of you remain.

267
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,820
One of your names will be written 10 times on the roulette.

268
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,690
So Min, Se Chan, and Kwang Soo.

269
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,990
They need to move onto the next mission.

270
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,160
So we'll put these three dishes in front of each of them.

271
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:22,390
(It's about the houtou? They don't have a good feeling about this.)

272
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,490
- It's for the mission. - So Min will...

273
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,920
- I'll have this pork houtou. - Se Chan, you take this.

274
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,420
- And Kwang Soo... - Wait, Jae Seok.

275
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,550
- Se Chan, you take this. - Wait, Jae Seok.

276
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,390
Hold on.

277
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,990
- I mean... - He's doing it on purpose again.

278
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,850
- He pushed what was next to me. - I just gave him the closest one.

279
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,160
Please pass this onto him. It's hot.

280
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,190
What's going on? It's unfair.

281
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,320
- Take your spoon and chopsticks. - Okay.

282
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,520
Maybe it's about eating quickly.

283
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,420
If this is really about eating...

284
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,820
- I... - It's either boning or eating.

285
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,160
Then let's draw lots.

286
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,520
(They decide to be fair.)

287
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,820
- Give me the chopsticks. - I like the idea.

288
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,390
- The short one, right? - Yes.

289
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,690
You get only one chance.

290
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,320
(They won't have a choice if they draw a short chopstick.)

291
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,720
(They must draw a fine chopstick to avoid eating soft-shelled turtle.)

292
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,250
Where is it? I closed my eyes.

293
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,590
- Here. - Okay, 1, 2...

294
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:09,350
(What will be Se Chan's choice?)

295
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,190
- Here. - Okay, 1, 2...

296
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,890
Three. Yes!

297
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,490
Kwang Soo!

298
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,320
(Se Chan avoids it.)

299
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,250
(Kwang Soo, I'm safe!)

300
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,390
Are you okay?

301
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,820
You just sounded very offensive.

302
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,990
No, I didn't.

303
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,150
- Yes! - Who will be the next?

304
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,490
Kwang Soo.

305
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,720
It's unpredictable. It totally depends on your luck.

306
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,420
I really don't want to go alone.

307
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,050
(Kwang Soo is afraid he might go to the Labyrinth alone.)

308
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,790
I really can't do it.

309
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,890
I might end up doing all my business there.

310
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,150
(He's now threatening the others.)

311
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,320
Go ahead and try it.

312
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,820
Don't you regret it after it happens.

313
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,220
Don't say things like, "How could you actually pee?"

314
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,550
- They have about 20 underwear. - I'm serious.

315
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,350
(Even the menu choice is so crucial to him.)

316
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,290
It's not the end yet.

317
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,050
I'm tearing up.

318
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,150
(What if the mission is about eating soft-shelled turtle?)

319
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,520
(It'll be advantageous for him only when he draws a regular chopstick.)

320
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,620
What will he draw?

321
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,520
- I can't watch it. - Raise a little higher.

322
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,150
- I can't stand watching it. - There you go.

323
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,920
- He picked 1. - It's 1 of the 2.

324
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,690
- He picked 1. - 1, 2...

325
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,250
(It's best to avoid unfamiliar food ingredients.)

326
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:20,550
(Who will be the one to take the soft-shelled turtle houtou?)

327
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,590
(Ta-da)

328
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,850
(He draws the shortest chopstick.)

329
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,890
(Kwang Soo gets to take the soft-shelled turtle houtou.)

330
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,390
(He must be cursed by an unlucky ghost for certain.)

331
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,250
How could you...

332
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,850
Perform an exorcism or something. How could you be this unlucky?

333
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,190
You're just...

334
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,320
- My goodness. - It's...

335
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,350
- It's so hilarious. - I mean,

336
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,320
he's so talented in things like this.

337
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,220
- Japanese ghosts must like him. - How could it go this way?

338
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,950
This wasn't planned.

339
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,820
Your name might really be written 20 times.

340
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,620
It'd be better for you to just volunteer to go then.

341
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,090
- 20 times. - Gosh.

342
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,290
- All right. - How could this happen?

343
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,120
It's still too early to give up. The third mission is very simple.

344
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,490
- He says it's simple. - We don't know what it's about yet.

345
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,490
Maybe it's about eating quickly.

346
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,490
You better not say gibberish.

347
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,150
(He warns the producer.)

348
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,590
- Eating quickly. - Then just eat quickly.

349
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,620
It won't be good for So Min either if that's the mission.

350
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,950
- Right. - Since she's the only female.

351
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:19,420
There are meat and noodles in each dish.

352
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,150
You'll clear it if you finish all the meat inside.

353
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,290
(Finish all the meat?)

354
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,320
(So it's about eating quickly. I knew it.)

355
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,250
Kwang Soo...

356
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,020
What is this, seriously?

357
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,520
(Why does it have to be you, soft-shelled turtle?)

358
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,590
I can't differentiate the meat from the bones.

359
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,350
- What is this? - Kwang Soo.

360
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,520
- What is this? - Poor Kwang Soo.

361
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,890
(So Min and Se Chan can eat with no problems.)

362
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,520
What is this? It's the neck.

363
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,550
How is it?

364
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,390
- You must know it's expensive. - It's really expensive.

365
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,750
(His hand shakes intensely.)

366
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,520
It's because you're scared, right?

367
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,320
- I can't even chew. - Are you done?

368
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,390
I'm done.

369
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,390
(Raising his hand)

370
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,150
- I can't even chew. - Are you done?

371
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,190
I'm done eating all the meat.

372
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,190
(He's done eating all the meat.)

373
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,490
We checked his dish,

374
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,050
- and he did finish his meat. - Okay!

375
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,620
(Se Chan is the 3rd person to clear the mission.)

376
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,190
(It's the battle between the two now.)

377
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,290
I can't go in alone.

378
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,220
- I really can't. - You have no choice.

379
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,150
I don't want to be on the front page of a newspaper.

380
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,350
I don't want them to write an article about my poop.

381
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,820
- Come on. - Hey.

382
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,150
(Don't you see we're eating now?)

383
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,890
- We're eating here. - Why would you bring that up?

384
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,750
I'm serious.

385
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,190
I'm really serious.

386
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,220
- That was too much. - We're still eating.

387
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,050
I don't understand why she had to bring that up.

388
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,190
I lost my appetite and was put off by her. This is crazy.

389
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,420
I just realized my dish's color is weird.

390
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,390
I'm serious.

391
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,850
(Will it be 10 names of So Min or 20 names of Kwang Soo?)

392
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,250
(Only the last mission is left. How will their fates turn out?)

393
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,390
This place is incredible.

394
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,450
(Team Happy Trip in the meantime)

395
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,520
"Yokohama".

396
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,750
(Every 20 dollars they spend during their trip...)

397
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,090
(will lead to one more ghost in the Labyrinth.)

398
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,290
(Without knowing the rule, they focus on taking pictures.)

399
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:17,320
(Sorry, Team Scary Trip, but we're having a great time.)

400
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,290
You don't have to try doing anything.

401
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,890
- You just come here and relax. - Come catch me.

402
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,190
(Try catching me.)

403
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,650
Come catch me.

404
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,320
(How about we play this game?)

405
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,020
Do you want to die?

406
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,650
- Come on. - You're dead meat if I catch you.

407
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,650
- People play this at the park. - Right.

408
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,050
To be honest, I haven't seen anyone do that at a park.

409
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,650
Haha, you are old enough to know it. Don't pretend otherwise.

410
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,520
Only a few people do it at the beach.

411
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,750
(Kicking)

412
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,620
Catch me if you can!

413
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,050
For goodness' sake.

414
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,920
Why would you play that game at a park?

415
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,490
You are dead when I catch you.

416
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,750
(She risks her life to play a game of tag with Jong Kook.)

417
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,720
(They arrive at a shopping center.)

418
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,320
How pretty.

419
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,250
(This is fun.)

420
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,320
(What should I buy?)

421
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,950
(They enjoy their unlimited amount of money.)

422
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,420
These shorts are nice.

423
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,220
This is great.

424
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,650
Where should we go next?

425
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,620
Let's eat meat with enjoyment.

426
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,990
(They feast on wagyu, the delicacy of Japan.)

427
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,320
(Well-marbled wagyu makes them salivate.)

428
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,020
This is high-quality.

429
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,920
(They lock in the juice by grilling the surface on a hot stone.)

430
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,890
- You can eat that piece. - Really?

431
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:40,620
(The perfect piece of meat fills the mouth with juice.)

432
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,520
(It's really tasty.)

433
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:48,190
It's so soft that it doesn't feel like meat.

434
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,720
(He savors the meat.)

435
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,420
It's so soft.

436
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,890
(The delicacy results in more ghosts in Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

437
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,950
(We are sorry for spending a lot of money.)

438
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,190
(Team Scary Trip doesn't know this.)

439
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,360
While you eat, you will take part in the last mission...

440
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,360
that involves 10 slots.

441
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,650
So Min and Kwang Soo,

442
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:19,520
please remove your name tag on your back...

443
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,890
and put it on the table.

444
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,090
You startled me.

445
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,320
Remove your name tag, not each other's.

446
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,050
- You startled me. - Put it on the table.

447
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,420
We will ask the employee of this restaurant to come in...

448
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,020
and pick a name tag he or she likes.

449
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,490
This is...

450
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,590
The person whose name tag is picked will receive 10 slots.

451
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,620
This is bad.

452
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,720
We will order another glass of Coke...

453
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,820
and ask the employee to choose a name tag.

454
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,420
(In this crucial moment...)

455
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,290
(Farting)

456
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,920
(Did someone fart?)

457
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,990
(What was that noise?)

458
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,220
What was that?

459
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,360
(Did someone really fart?)

460
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,420
What was that?

461
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,450
(Farting)

462
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,860
- What was that? - What is Seok Jin doing?

463
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,720
I can't believe him. Wait a minute.

464
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,550
- Wait a minute. - You heard it, right?

465
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,450
He should get a slot.

466
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,320
(He's ill-mannered.)

467
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,050
- He farted. - He farted.

468
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,450
Seriously.

469
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,020
What do you think you are doing?

470
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,250
What was that? What happened?

471
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,320
- What do you think you are doing? - My goodness.

472
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,690
I thought it was a frog.

473
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,650
I thought there was a frog behind me.

474
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,990
(Seok Jin becomes a frog during a meal in Japan.)

475
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,590
(There is a frog inside me.)

476
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,720
- I thought it was a frog. - What do you think you are doing?

477
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,150
What was that?

478
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,990
It's bad if the employee takes your name tag.

479
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,320
Is it good if the employee takes your name tag?

480
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,790
- It's bad. - It's bad.

481
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,920
The person whose name tag is taken will place last.

482
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,690
Should the penalty go to the one with a remaining name tag?

483
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,490
- The one with a remaining name tag. - The one with a taken name tag.

484
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,750
Let's play rock-paper-scissors. Rock-paper-scissors.

485
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,320
(The winner will decide.)

486
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,360
(So Min wins.)

487
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,750
The penalty should go to the one with a remaining name tag.

488
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,050
(The person whose name tag is chosen will pass.)

489
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,120
The server is here.

490
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,360
- Is the server here? - Yes.

491
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,820
Excuse me.

492
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,820
(The server is here.)

493
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,250
- Thank you very much. - Excuse me.

494
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,890
- Excuse me. - Yes?

495
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,990
Please pick one name tag.

496
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,620
- Please choose one. - One name tag.

497
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,620
- You can choose one. - Okay.

498
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,750
One. Okay.

499
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,920
- Choose the one you like. - It's good to be chosen, right?

500
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,120
(The final rule)

501
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,920
- Choose the one you like. - It's good to be chosen, right?

502
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,690
(She holds two people's fate.)

503
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,750
(Please pick a name tag.)

504
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,220
(Grabbing)

505
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,390
(I am saved.)

506
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,190
(Kwang Soo lost the war of 10 slots in a roulette.)

507
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,050
(It looks like I am cursed.)

508
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,590
Kwang Soo is so unlucky.

509
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,690
(Kwang Soo will have 20 slots.)

510
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,650
- Thank you. - Thank you.

511
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,890
- Kwang Soo. - Thank you.

512
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,590
(I can't believe it.)

513
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,690
Because she didn't know what we were doing,

514
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,360
she had no qualms about choosing one.

515
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,820
"Do you want me to pick one?"

516
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,290
Would you be okay?

517
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,020
- He is so unlucky. - Thus,

518
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,120
Kwang Soo will fill in 20 more slots with 10 additional ones.

519
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,820
- Firstly... - I am filling the slots...

520
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,720
with Kwang Soo's name.

521
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
20 slots out of 24 slots have Kwang Soo's name.

522
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,590
It will be incredible if someone with a single slot gets chosen.

523
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,950
You are the master of bad luck.

524
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,020
(Spinning)

525
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,490
(Should I spin it for fun?)

526
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,290
Yu Jae Seok.

527
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,620
(Yu Jae Seok)

528
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,150
- Yu Jae Seok. - Yu Jae Seok.

529
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,120
We don't know what will happen.

530
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,120
- We don't know what will happen. - I won't lose hope until the end.

531
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,520
I won't lose hope until the end. I won't give up.

532
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,620
I won't lose hope until the end. I won't give up.

533
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,720
(Will it happen again?)

534
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,550
- That startled me. - Jeon So Min.

535
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,620
- Jeon So Min. - Jeon So Min.

536
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,720
- We don't know what will happen. - Seriously.

537
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,050
We don't know what will happen.

538
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,360
(So Min gets picked this time.)

539
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,360
- We don't know what will happen. - Seriously.

540
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,290
- We don't know what will happen. - How did this happen?

541
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,590
(The 5 unlucky members made a scary game of roulette.)

542
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,020
- We don't know what will happen. - Seriously.

543
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,720
- We don't know what will happen. - What is going on?

544
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,990
Every slot belongs to Kwang Soo.

545
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,520
Lee Kwang Soo.

546
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,020
(Lee Kwang Soo is chosen this time.)

547
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,020
(Disappointed)

548
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,290
- Out of three rounds... - He was chosen once.

549
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,860
He was chosen once.

550
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,360
Kwang Soo was chosen twice.

551
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,920
It's Lee Kwang Soo. That makes sense.

552
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,620
Almost every slot has his name.

553
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,620
Our names are hardly visible.

554
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,750
- We don't know what will happen. - It's Kwang Soo.

555
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,050
Lee Kwang Soo.

556
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,990
- This is too much. - Lee Kwang Soo.

557
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,860
Lee Kwang Soo...

558
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,250
is an unlucky name.

559
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,320
- My grandfather named me. - I'm sorry.

560
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,990
- It's unlucky on the roulette. - It's a name I have to live with.

561
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,290
I meant that it's unlucky on the roulette.

562
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,450
If there is a way...

563
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,290
It looks like you found your appetite.

564
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,990
(The last match made her forget her hunger.)

565
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,020
So Min.

566
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,690
I am sorry, Kwang Soo.

567
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,850
You received a penalty because of a change in the rule.

568
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,990
Your name tag was left behind.

569
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,320
The original rule was different.

570
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,190
The penalty was originally for the one with a taken name tag.

571
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,820
You should have left the rule as it was.

572
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,290
Why did you change it?

573
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,190
It doesn't help.

574
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:05,890
I sat still without doing anything.

575
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,350
I even lost in the round of rock-paper-scissors.

576
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,490
I didn't get to choose the rule.

577
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,650
- I sat still. - That's your problem.

578
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,120
Why did you sit still? Confront your fate.

579
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,650
Confront your fate like me.

580
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,750
Fight.

581
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,920
- Win. - For goodness' sake.

582
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,820
I confronted my fate, fought and won.

583
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,950
- I am so annoyed. - You are too passive.

584
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,450
That's his problem.

585
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,490
I am so annoyed that they are telling me those things.

586
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,750
(Lee Kwang Soo, the unlucky man in Tokyo)

587
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,120
So Min, you offered to take a slot from Kwang Soo earlier.

588
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,620
Did I?

589
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,090
I remember that.

590
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,190
You offered to take a slot for a bracelet he gave you.

591
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,090
- You offered to take a slot. - When did I do that?

592
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,150
(Will she take a slot?)

593
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,750
- When did I do that? - She is acting again.

594
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,420
- She is shameless. - You won't take a single slot.

595
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,290
I can't believe you.

596
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,350
I will write my name on one of your slots.

597
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,320
- Will you do that? - I will take three slots...

598
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,820
if you win in three rounds of rock-paper-scissors.

599
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,090
- Really? - Three slots?

600
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,320
Are you offering to write your name in three of his slots?

601
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,350
- I will do that if you win... - Rock-paper-scissors?

602
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,750
In three consecutive rounds of rock-paper-scissors.

603
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,990
Don't give me that nonsense.

604
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,920
I haven't won in rock-paper-scissors once...

605
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,050
- in the entire day. - Kwang Soo.

606
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:18,120
- Fight against your fate. - Fight.

607
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,450
- Otherwise, you will fall back. - Kwang Soo.

608
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,850
If you lose in all three rounds, write your name in my slot.

609
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,890
- If you win in all three rounds... - If I lose in all three rounds?

610
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,950
Yes. If you win a round,

611
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,790
I will take a slot.

612
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,550
(If Kwang Soo wins a round, So Min will take a slot from him.)

613
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,850
I will take three slots.

614
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,190
- Really? - Three slots?

615
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,520
Are you offering to write your name in three of his slots?

616
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
(If Kwang Soo wins all 3 rounds, 3 slots will go to So Min.)

617
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,250
There is no way I will lose in all three rounds.

618
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,950
Winning in all three rounds will be equally hard.

619
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,290
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

620
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,550
- Okay. - He is doing well.

621
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,750
- Rock-paper-scissors. - That's good.

622
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,890
Let's go.

623
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,120
(The real game starts.)

624
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

625
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,550
(What will be the result of the first round?)

626
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,720
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

627
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,520
(Kwang Soo wins.)

628
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,890
Okay. Rock-paper-scissors.

629
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,050
(Kwang Soo wins again.)

630
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,650
Rock-paper-scissors. Okay.

631
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,020
Wait a minute.

632
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,350
(What is going on?)

633
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,750
Wait a minute.

634
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,650
(Kwang Soo charges like a storm and takes 2 wins in a row.)

635
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,950
- One slot goes to So Min. - That's right.

636
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,520
One slot goes to So Min.

637
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,290
- Shall we clear the table first? - Shall we do that?

638
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,150
(The final match will decide who gets Solo Tour Card.)

639
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,250
- All right. - Thank you for the bracelet.

640
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,390
All right.

641
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,620
(Kwang Soo is desperate to get rid of 3 slots.)

642
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:30,550
(The last round will decide who gets 3 slots.)

643
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,650
Kwang Soo has nothing to lose.

644
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,150
That's right.

645
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,590
It's his chance to walk on the flowery road.

646
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,920
Let me win a round. Kwang Soo.

647
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,120
Will you play rock or scissors?

648
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,050
- What will you play? - What?

649
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,890
I am sorry. I am not good at that.

650
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,590
- Stop it. - What will you play?

651
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,250
Kwang Soo, what will you play?

652
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,920
- Rock. - Rock?

653
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,620
- Will you play rock? - Yes. Rock.

654
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,990
(Really?)

655
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,090
(3 slots depend on this round.)

656
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,950
(Who will be the winner of the last round?)

657
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,250
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

658
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,150
(So Min wins.)

659
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,190
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

660
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,790
(I hate myself.)

661
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,120
(I won!)

662
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,420
I can't believe he played scissors.

663
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,990
For goodness' sake.

664
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,050
We can't help him in any way.

665
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,550
I will take a slot.

666
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,120
- One slot goes to So Min. - Thank you, So Min.

667
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,790
(It's still beneficial to Kwang Soo.)

668
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,550
If that slot gets chosen,

669
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,250
- it will be incredible. - It will be uncanny.

670
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,720
If that slot gets chosen, it will be incredible.

671
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,690
- I think it'll get stuck here. - No, it won't.

672
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,950
- I think it'll get stuck there. - Thank you, So Min.

673
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,790
- It'll stop here. - Thank you so much.

674
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,790
It's heavier there.

675
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,850
(What are their fates?)

676
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,290
(It's getting dark.)

677
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,890
It's getting late.

678
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:56,820
I'm getting even more worried.

679
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,150
I shouldn't drink too much water.

680
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,690
You'll want to go to the bathroom.

681
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,050
(Kwang Soo and So Min are more worried than the others.)

682
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,120
There won't be any bathroom.

683
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,090
My goodness.

684
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,090
(Kwang Soo and So Min are more worried than the others.)

685
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,120
- My goodness. - It'll be so scary.

686
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,420
(Finally)

687
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,120
- Are we here? - Are we here?

688
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
(They arrive at Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

689
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,290
(They'll enter the labyrinth soon.)

690
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:23,090
- My goodness. - The camera can't film it all.

691
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,290
You'll say all kinds of swear words in there.

692
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,490
We shouldn't. We're shooting.

693
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,720
You will.

694
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,390
(You will say swear words before anyone else.)

695
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,890
You'll only hear beeps.

696
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,190
My goodness.

697
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,950
(This place makes you say all the swear words you know.)

698
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,420
What is this sound?

699
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,590
Are they rehearsing?

700
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,590
Is it a rehearsal?

701
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,790
It'll be finished soon.

702
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,390
- Is it a rehearsal? - What was that sound? Who is that?

703
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,690
- Who said a swear word? - Did he just say a swear word?

704
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,790
Was it a staff member?

705
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,390
- My goodness. - Who was that?

706
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,890
We're doomed.

707
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,950
Staff members don't usually say swear words.

708
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,190
- Someone said swear words. - Someone swore in Korean.

709
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,190
- Who was that? - It's our staff member.

710
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,650
- Gosh! - Oh, my.

711
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,590
- Who is it? - What are you doing?

712
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,020
Who are you?

713
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:20,750
(They're even startled by a floor director.)

714
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,090
All right. Let's go.

715
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,590
- Sorry? - Let's go.

716
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,790
(Finally)

717
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,090
My goodness.

718
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:34,490
- I don't want to go in. - So Min, don't lag behind.

719
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,220
Come to the front.

720
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,320
Look at that.

721
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,350
(I miss my mom.)

722
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,390
What's with that blue light?

723
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,390
- Gosh. - What's that?

724
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:46,590
(It is located in Yamanashi and takes 50 minutes to go through.)

725
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:50,090
(Many people have witnessed ghosts in the labyrinth.)

726
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:53,620
(It's been introduced many times on Japanese television.)

727
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,450
The employees here have a memorial service every morning.

728
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,850
- Really? - They do?

729
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,920
Why?

730
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,090
This is where they hold memorial services.

731
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,850
Why do they do that?

732
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,690
It's for the ghosts living here.

733
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,320
- It looks so creepy. - It looks scary.

734
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,950
My goodness.

735
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:14,050
This is not just a set.

736
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,390
All right.

737
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,420
The grand finale of Running Man's Global Project.

738
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,920
Welcome to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.

739
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,020
(Welcome...)

740
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:27,220
(to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

741
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,490
How do you feel to finally be here?

742
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,750
What do you think?

743
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,120
What answer are you expecting?

744
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,150
Do you want me to kick you?

745
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,650
As I told you earlier today,

746
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,020
the expenditure of Team Happy Trip...

747
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,750
was supposed to determine the number of the ghosts.

748
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,690
As the other team spent a huge amount of money,

749
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,320
it's been decided that you will see all the ghosts they have.

750
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,150
(All the ghosts)

751
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,790
- All of them? - Yes.

752
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,690
Haha is unbelievable.

753
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,990
- Gosh. - What should we do?

754
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:04,990
Alone...

755
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,950
(For now, they can only imagine.)

756
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,050
(The horror will become real in a short while.)

757
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,920
(The maximum horror)

758
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,690
(It's never been worse.)

759
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,850
Please.

760
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,590
(This place is included in the Guinness World Records.)

761
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,750
(They will soon learn why.)

762
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,190
(Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, Haha, thank you so much.)

763
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,490
Before you enter,

764
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,750
we will turn the roulette wheel.

765
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,690
- What should I do? - It will determine who will...

766
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:33,420
(The roulette will determine who will enter the labyrinth alone.)

767
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,020
It will determine who will go through the place alone.

768
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,190
Gosh, it's here.

769
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,320
- We've been turning it all day. - It's real now.

770
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,190
- It's on for real. - It's real now.

771
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,750
- It's real now. - It is.

772
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,420
I'll work hard.

773
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,090
I mean it.

774
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,790
(Kwang Soo has a 80-percent chance.)

775
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,790
My goodness.

776
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,850
Kwang Soo.

777
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,750
(He is pretending to feel sick.)

778
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,750
Stop pretending.

779
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,490
Stop it.

780
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:02,750
What are you doing?

781
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,850
He's pulling his tongue in.

782
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,390
Why are you rolling your tongue in?

783
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,420
I seriously feel sick.

784
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,290
- Me too. - I feel sick.

785
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,120
I have neutral fat, I mean, visceral fat.

786
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,450
Neutral fats?

787
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,490
I'm not in a good condition.

788
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,190
(I have the worst condition here.)

789
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,950
Hey.

790
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:24,190
Why do I have a bad feeling?

791
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:28,490
You can't even find other names than mine there.

792
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,690
(Kwang Soo's name is written in 19 slots.)

793
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,790
Please decide who will turn the wheel.

794
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,920
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Okay.

795
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,150
Rock-paper-scissors.

796
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,290
(Kwang Soo and Se Chan win.)

797
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,390
You might get to turn the wheel.

798
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,420
What's the point of winning now?

799
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,550
(The only reward is turning the wheel himself.)

800
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,590
What's the point?

801
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,520
He practiced so much.

802
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,420
It doesn't matter. Of course, if you enter alone, it'll be scarier...

803
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,020
What is it?

804
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,390
What happened?

805
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,420
Do you think you will enter alone?

806
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,950
I don't want to go in there.

807
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,850
(I don't want to go in there.)

808
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:06,920
Do you think we do?

809
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,820
- Why did you do that so suddenly? - Hey!

810
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,150
You will be punished for this.

811
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,550
(You will be punished for this.)

812
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,850
- Why are you doing this? - So Min is crying.

813
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,950
- So Min just cursed you. - Why do you curse me?

814
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,720
- She cursed you. - Don't do this.

815
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,490
Let's just get it over with and go home.

816
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,950
- Let's do this. - You guys don't say anything.

817
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,190
(How can you say that in front of me?)

818
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,420
Don't say that in front of me.

819
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,650
(Do you know how much I want to cry right now?)

820
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,850
You brats...

821
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,650
- What did you just say? - I'm sorry.

822
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,520
- I want to go home. - I'm sorry.

823
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,690
Let's get it over with.

824
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,590
Let's get it over with and go home.

825
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,590
This is too much.

826
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,120
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

827
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,220
(The roulette wheel...)

828
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,590
(will be turned by Se Chan.)

829
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,750
- Kwang Soo lost. - Se Chan will...

830
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,290
- turn the wheel. - Why did I win?

831
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,020
I don't want to decide the result.

832
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,250
(Kwang Soo's fate is now in Se Chan's hands.)

833
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,250
(The roulette wheel will be turned.)

834
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,590
- Se Chan. - Yes.

835
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,850
The wheel has to turn at least five times.

836
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,790
- I'll turn it hard. - Are you doing this?

837
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,550
- Will this decide the result? - Let me practice first.

838
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,790
Don't practice. Just do it.

839
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,850
- Just do it. - Don't practice.

840
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,590
Turn it hard. Do it right.

841
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,790
- Turn it. - Challenge.

842
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,090
- Here we go. - Turn it.

843
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,250
1, 2, and 3.

844
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,150
Challenge.

845
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,090
(Who...)

846
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,490
(will...)

847
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,790
- Challenge. - This will decide.

848
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:28,690
(Who will enter the labyrinth alone?)

849
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,890
1, 2, and 3.

850
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,190
- Challenge. - This will decide.

851
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:42,850
(Kwang Soo will enter alone.)

852
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,150
- Oh, my. - That was close.

853
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,490
- Gosh. - Seriously.

854
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,790
Thank you.

855
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,420
- Thank you. - Gosh.

856
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,690
- I was so surprised. - Thank you.

857
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,090
I was so surprised.

858
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,750
So Min, Jae Seok, Se Chan, Seok Jin...

859
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,920
They were all here.

860
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,150
- They were all here. - Gosh.

861
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,250
Please let me turn the wheel.

862
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,150
Please, give me some hope.

863
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,320
Just once.

864
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,550
Kwang Soo, you can't...

865
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,590
(Bowing)

866
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:11,090
(I beg you.)

867
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,390
- Just once. - Kwang Soo.

868
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,390
(The other members bow to him too.)

869
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,990
I won't ask for anything more. Just once.

870
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,250
- Kwang Soo. - Just once.

871
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,750
(You have to fall for me to survive.)

872
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,190
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

873
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,190
- Kwang Soo. - We can't help it.

874
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,990
- We have no choice. - Kwang Soo.

875
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,150
Please let me turn it once.

876
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,090
If it's you again,

877
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,750
will you go in without any cameramen?

878
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,550
(Will you go in without any cameramen?)

879
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,590
It has to benefit us somehow.

880
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,920
- Look at his smile. - He loves that idea.

881
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,620
How can you do this to me?

882
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,520
It has to benefit us.

883
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,420
We can't keep giving you more chances.

884
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,420
Then...

885
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:49,020
I think you should just go.

886
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,950
(Jae Seok turned the wheel for fun.)

887
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,120
It's Se Chan.

888
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,550
(Se Chan is chosen.)

889
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,020
- It's Se Chan. - Se Chan.

890
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,190
- Okay. - Thank goodness.

891
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,120
(There is hope.)

892
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,150
What do you mean?

893
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,890
Give me another chance.

894
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,590
- I won't say anything more. - If it's you again,

895
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,090
- don't say anything more. - Okay.

896
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,320
- Just once. - Go ahead.

897
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,690
Okay. I don't want to play dirty either.

898
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,420
- Turn it. - I don't usually do this.

899
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,420
I mean it. Here I go.

900
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,950
It's the other side.

901
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:19,450
(Kwang Soo gets the last chance.)

902
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,050
Start within 3 seconds. 5...

903
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,050
Challenge.

904
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,650
(The last chance)

905
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,390
(There is a high chance Kwang Soo will be chosen again.)

906
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,920
(The chance is 19 out of 24.)

907
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,890
(That's 79.17 percent.)

908
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,320
(Will the fate...)

909
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,790
(turn its back on Kwang Soo again?)

910
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,620
(It stops.)

911
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,090
(Lee Kwang Soo)

912
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,350
It's the same slot.

913
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,320
What is this?

914
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,990
- Thank you. - What is this?

915
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,490
That was close.

916
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,190
- So Min, - That's a relief.

917
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,590
- it was really close. - I'm so relieved.

918
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,190
We're all entering the place anyway.

919
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,590
Kwang Soo, you can't help it.

920
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,120
- We're all going in. - My heart...

921
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,420
My heart is...

922
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,690
So Min, that was close.

923
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,820
It's been decided that...

924
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,320
Kwang Soo will enter alone.

925
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,120
(I'm entering the place alone.)

926
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,150
Unbelievable.

927
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,390
(Jae Seok and So Min, Seok Jin and Se Chan)

928
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,790
(Kwang Soo goes alone.)

929
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,150
So Min, take good care of Jae Seok.

930
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,320
I'll take care of Seok Jin.

931
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,050
So Min, I'm so scared.

932
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,720
I really don't want to go in.

933
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,790
Kwang Soo, you'll be possessed if you go there.

934
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:38,760
I mean it.

935
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,650
I hate you, Running Man crew.

936
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,590
(They all get serious as they are about to face the horror.)

937
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,850
- I hate this. - Everyone.

938
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,950
You might enter the place and just run through the whole house.

939
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,590
That's why there's another mission.

940
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:53,290
(It's a special mission for them to maximize their experience.)

941
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:58,390
There are three name tags including the cameraman's in the place.

942
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,050
- There are three name tags. - What is he saying now?

943
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:02,620
- Why is there the cameraman's? - What did you just say?

944
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,520
You have to find 1 of 3 name tags.

945
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,590
The exit door will open when you show the gatekeeper the name tag.

946
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,950
Whoever finds his or her name tag first can escape the place first.

947
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,590
(They can escape the place separately.)

948
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,190
- We can escape separately? - What did you say?

949
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,490
How can we do that? We should get out all together.

950
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,350
- Excuse me. What about me? - Jae Seok.

951
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,760
(If the cameraman leaves, he will really be alone.)

952
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,820
He ditched me when we were at the deserted school.

953
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,260
(Yoon Sang left Kwang Soo alone during another scary special.)

954
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,290
What am I going to do?

955
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:34,120
Now, let's go through the gate and put on necessary equipment.

956
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,950
- We need equipment? - After that, we'll go in.

957
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,120
Let's head in.

958
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,260
(They finally enter.)

959
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,520
(They enter the final destination of the Dangerous Trip at last.)

960
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,020
- I am about to lose it. - Look at the iron gate.

961
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,790
Something is on top of the gate.

962
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,760
It's a head.

963
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,850
(They are already scared.)

964
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:52,150
- There's a head on top of it. - We are in big trouble.

965
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,350
I can't handle this.

966
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,550
(Sighing)

967
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,150
- I don't know anymore. - I can't...

968
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,420
- I can't do this. I'm serious. - I'm about to go crazy.

969
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,520
I don't feel good already.

970
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,020
(I want to go to the toilet already.)

971
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,320
Please give them the helmets.

972
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,590
(Jae Seok and So Min get ready in order to enter the place.)

973
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,520
(He lets out a sigh.)

974
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,350
(Kwang Soo seems serious.)

975
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,850
You are not going in there, are you?

976
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,790
- I already experienced it. - You did?

977
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,790
- How was it? - Look. I can't stand straight now.

978
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,350
(He can't stand up after his experience.)

979
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,820
Oh, my. It's scary, isn't it?

980
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,260
- I'm drenched in sweat. - Really?

981
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,350
(I am not joking.)

982
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,290
- Why are you trying to scare us? - Hey.

983
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:32,820
Why are you trying to get us worked up? We are already scared to death.

984
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,450
I am not kidding with you. I mean it.

985
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,820
He's not lying.

986
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,390
I've never been to a place like this before.

987
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,390
(He has never gone to a place as horrendous as here before.)

988
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,760
When I was listening to him, I was about to kick him in the side.

989
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,790
(It could have been a disaster.)

990
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,820
(Kwang Soo, good luck.)

991
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,260
(He's pale.)

992
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,350
All right then. The first pair...

993
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,950
(Everything is set.)

994
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:52,290
Jae Seok, So Min,

995
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:56,690
and the cameramen for this pair will go in now.

996
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,590
(The door of Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear finally creaks open.)

997
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:04,920
- So Min, - What are they doing?

998
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,890
It smells weird here.

999
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,390
You're right. I smell medicine. I can smell disinfectants.

1000
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:11,890
That's right.

1001
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,590
It's a medicinal smell.

1002
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,420
We are in big trouble.

1003
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:19,490
- It's a strong smell. - The medicinal smell is strong.

1004
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,620
(They can't seem to start.)

1005
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,020
- Good luck. - Jae Seok, what are we going to do?

1006
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,120
(Hesitant)

1007
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:32,390
(The start of the longest journey that takes up the most time)

1008
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,690
(They take the first step forward.)

1009
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,690
Gosh, this is so eerie.

1010
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,220
(He turns back right away.)

1011
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,760
So Min, this feels eerie.

1012
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,260
Go in. You can't waste time here.

1013
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,550
Come on. Go inside.

1014
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,150
Don't look at us.

1015
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,690
- This is so scary. - Hey.

1016
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,290
(They enter again after a lame excuse.)

1017
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,820
So Min, come here.

1018
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,350
So Min, you can hold my arm.

1019
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,990
(Let's do this.)

1020
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,190
(It's too dark in here.)

1021
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,760
So Min, we have no choice.

1022
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,320
- Gosh, I can hear the music. - They went in.

1023
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,050
(The horror of the place isn't factitious, but rather realistic.)

1024
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,290
I'm so scared.

1025
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,190
I'm really scared. Gosh, that startled me.

1026
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,150
Me too. I'm scared to death too. This isn't a joke.

1027
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:17,790
(The Labyrinth overwhelms them and forces them to be on alert.)

1028
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,150
What are we going to do?

1029
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,760
(From outside, they can only hear sounds.)

1030
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,090
Their voices are even scarier.

1031
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,450
- Hold on. - Come this way.

1032
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,620
Wait.

1033
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,590
- Hey, what are you doing? - This is...

1034
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,920
- I can't wear the helmet. - Why can't you?

1035
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,420
I'm sorry, but we had the helmet on.

1036
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:37,150
It's scary, but the problem is that it keeps...

1037
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,720
coming down no matter how well I put it on.

1038
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,150
- My face won't be shown. - I can't see with this either.

1039
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,350
It really does.

1040
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,720
- Then return the helmets. - Can we do that?

1041
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,490
We will film you with the installed cameras inside and the cameramen.

1042
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,620
You came out because you were scared, right?

1043
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,690
- To be honest, it's really scary. - It's really scary.

1044
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,550
- It really is. - I'm about to go crazy.

1045
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,850
- I can't move my feet. - I can't move forward.

1046
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,450
- Go and come back quickly. - Hey, show us the power of Korea.

1047
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:03,020
(Se Chan speaks out of the blue.)

1048
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,890
How is that pertinent to this?

1049
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,220
"Power of Korea"?

1050
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,850
Show what a Korean man can do.

1051
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,120
(It's the power of a coward.)

1052
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,450
This is no joke.

1053
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,820
- Should we walk quickly? - No.

1054
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,320
We have to find the name tags.

1055
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,820
Be careful.

1056
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,020
(Sighing)

1057
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,350
- Goodness. - That startled me.

1058
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,260
(This is how dark it is.)

1059
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,490
- Didn't you hear a noise just now? - What? My gosh.

1060
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,550
(It's too dark for them to navigate.)

1061
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,590
- So Min, what do we do? - What are we going to do?

1062
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,420
Jae Seok, how are we going to do this?

1063
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:43,150
I'm easily scared, but you're scaring me even more.

1064
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:47,760
(We have to go through there, right?)

1065
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,150
This is insane.

1066
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:54,390
(They only walked 3m, but it feels as if they walked longer.)

1067
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:58,050
Wait. I can't pass through here. Jae Seok, I can't go there.

1068
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,850
- Hey. - I think someone will pop up.

1069
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:02,550
So Min, standing here won't do us any good.

1070
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,490
Don't you know that I'm scared too?

1071
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:09,990
(The scariness of the place is more realistic than the reality.)

1072
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,690
What if someone just pops up now?

1073
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:20,420
(They take one step at a time.)

1074
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,820
- Oh, my! - Oh, my goodness.

1075
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,350
- Why did you scream? - You scared me.

1076
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,950
Why are you screaming?

1077
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,590
Kwon Ryeol, come on.

1078
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,520
(These sounds scare the members waiting outside.)

1079
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,760
Shouldn't we go in there?

1080
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,020
We have to find our name tags.

1081
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,190
(Gosh, I am exhausted.)

1082
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,790
(Jae Seok and So Min have just gotten past the entrance.)

1083
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,150
(Grabbing)

1084
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,720
Why are your hands so cold?

1085
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,290
They are like ice.

1086
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:54,260
(In this mysterious space, there are no signs of others except them.)

1087
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,550
(He gets scared by himself.)

1088
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:02,760
You startled me.

1089
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:06,890
(They have a long and scary way ahead of them.)

1090
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:15,350
- Shoot. - Why are you doing that?

1091
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:16,390
You scared me.

1092
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:18,120
- Why are you doing this? - What's the matter?

1093
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,890
Kwon Ryeol, stop being scared.

1094
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,390
Hey, you shouldn't.

1095
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,760
(It feels like a ghost is accompanying them.)

1096
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,190
Keep an eye out for the name tags.

1097
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:31,550
They wouldn't have put it inside the room. I'd be able to see it, right?

1098
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,450
It's dark. It's so dark in here.

1099
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,220
It's pitch dark.

1100
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:38,820
(They enter the prop room full of frightening materials.)

1101
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,490
- I can't go in there. - Something's going to be in it.

1102
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:41,920
- I can't walk in there. - This is...

1103
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,650
It's completely dark in there.

1104
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:44,760
This is impossible.

1105
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,820
(They can't take a step forward from where they are standing.)

1106
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,650
- It's completely dark in there. - This is impossible.

1107
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,020
Oh, my goodness!

1108
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,820
(Screaming)

1109
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,150
- Oh, no. - Goodness.

1110
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:01,950
That was so scary.

1111
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,350
(In an instant, it becomes a place of wailing.)

1112
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,450
- Hold on. Let's hurry. - This is insane.

1113
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,650
(The real wailing has begun.)

1114
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:11,820
They are scared now.

1115
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,260
That must have horrified them.

1116
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,290
Please turn it off.

1117
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:18,690
- Please turn it off. - Please.

1118
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,950
- We don't want to listen to it. - We're sorry. Please turn it off.

1119
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:22,490
(We want to rest for the remaining time.)

1120
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:24,450
- Why are you doing this to us? - Let's just hurry.

1121
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:28,550
Please stop. That's enough.

1122
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,450
Hold on.

1123
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:32,350
- Wait. - Goodness.

1124
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:34,390
That really scared me to death.

1125
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,920
(You scared us even more.)

1126
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,350
Jae Seok, hold on a moment.

1127
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:40,220
- So Min, wait. - I want to get this over with.

1128
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:42,850
- Oh, my. - Okay. I got it.

1129
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,920
I'm scared even more because of you.

1130
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:47,450
- So Min, don't cry. - That really did a number on me.

1131
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:49,250
Please don't cry.

1132
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,790
- I was so shocked. - Please don't.

1133
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:52,120
(She starts crying within 5 minutes.)

1134
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:55,690
Jae Seok, it's too dark over there.

1135
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:58,790
(Kwon Ryeol and So Min maximize the horror of the Labyrinth.)

1136
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,690
There's a sound coming from there. I don't think I can go there.

1137
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,120
That really scared me.

1138
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,820
The ghost did the job, but why didn't they leave?

1139
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,020
(The ghosts are fully dedicated.)

1140
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,690
- What if you cry again over there? - It was so scary.

1141
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:12,950
- What am I going to do if you cry? - I can't handle this.

1142
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,650
(They hear a sound again.)

1143
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:16,650
There's a sound coming from there.

1144
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,020
- What am I going to do? - Hey, go check it out.

1145
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,150
You want me to go there alone?

1146
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,750
A sound is coming from there. Come on. Go and see what it is.

1147
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,850
(The reason why they are hesitant to go is because...)

1148
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:30,920
(an operating room full of surgical tools is before their eyes.)

1149
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,320
(They muster up the courage and make stealthy footsteps.)

1150
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,850
What is this sound?

1151
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,950
What should we do?

1152
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,690
There it is. There is a name tag.

1153
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:46,620
(Did they find a name tag in the operating room?)

1154
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,690
- It's right there. Look over there. - Where is it?

1155
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,790
It's Kwon Ryeol's.

1156
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:52,220
Seriously? Why does it have to be his?

1157
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:54,250
(What? It's mine?)

1158
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,350
You should go get it since it's yours. Hurry.

1159
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:02,520
(The four of them set foot in the operating room.)

1160
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,020
What are we going to do?

1161
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,550
(This room is the scariest of all. They get serious.)

1162
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,120
(A name tag is placed.)

1163
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,150
- I'm about to lose my senses. - I keep hearing the sound.

1164
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:15,920
Hey, this is Kwon Ryeol's.

1165
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,390
(Kwon Ryeol is the 1st one to obtain the name tag.)

1166
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:19,220
- Kwon Ryeol, don't go out. - Don't go out by yourself.

1167
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,520
The exit is that way. You have to go through the exit.

1168
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,320
(He exerts all of his strength to take the name tag.)

1169
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,050
- You should go through the exit. - I'll hold onto it for you.

1170
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,350
No, I'll hold it.

1171
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:29,890
(Let's not trust him. We should hurry and find our name tags too.)

1172
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:31,750
Where is my name tag?

1173
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:33,520
(Sniffling)

1174
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:36,720
Goodness, I want to cry.

1175
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,290
- My goodness. - Where's my name tag?

1176
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:41,020
I have to find it.

1177
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:44,790
From where are they coming out?

1178
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,850
(Every corner is dark and suspicious.)

1179
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,120
I don't know whether it's a person or not.

1180
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,950
Gosh, here's my name tag.

1181
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,920
(So Min finds her name tag.)

1182
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:58,420
(She finally smiles after finding her name tag.)

1183
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:02,920
(They're scared out of their wits.)

1184
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,450
(You must stay alert at all times.)

1185
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:07,890
- Goodness. - I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

1186
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,920
I didn't know this would happen suddenly.

1187
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,450
I'm sorry. Wait.

1188
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,350
Wait a minute.

1189
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:19,020
That was so sudden.

1190
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,420
He should have said something.

1191
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,050
- Stop crying. - Jae Seok.

1192
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:25,650
Come on, stop crying.

1193
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,920
- Stop crying. - It was too sudden.

1194
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,450
I was shocked.

1195
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:33,420
Why does he keep following us? Wasn't once enough?

1196
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,950
- Someone stepped on my toes. - Gosh, I was scared.

1197
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,850
- I'll go quickly. - Wait.

1198
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:43,790
- Are you serious? - I'm leaving.

1199
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:45,750
How could you?

1200
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:46,820
(You're a traitor.)

1201
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,350
I have to leave now.

1202
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:49,750
(She's too scared to move.)

1203
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:53,990
Do you know there are many ghosts where it's crowded?

1204
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,520
(He's too exhausted to respond.)

1205
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,720
I'm serious.

1206
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,890
You can't enter there alone.

1207
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:05,190
- You can't leave alone. - I know.

1208
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,390
How could anyone go there alone?

1209
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:09,750
It's the worst for Kwang Soo.

1210
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:13,790
The cameramen went inside to take a look around.

1211
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:17,220
There's one cameraman who refused to enter.

1212
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,120
- Who was it? - It was Yoon Sang.

1213
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,150
(He's Kwang Soo's designated cameraman.)

1214
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,820
Can I have a different cameraman?

1215
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,650
(Switch to a cameraman whom I can trust.)

1216
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,690
Where is Yoon Sang?

1217
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,850
Yoon Sang?

1218
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,220
- Where is he? - Yoon Sang.

1219
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,050
Did he run away?

1220
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,290
Choi Yoon Sang.

1221
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,520
He's gone.

1222
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,320
Isn't this his camera?

1223
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,090
(He left his camera.)

1224
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:43,350
Where is he?

1225
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:46,220
(What's going on?)

1226
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:48,020
Where did that punk go?

1227
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:53,990
(What will happen to Kwang Soo?)

1228
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:56,620
What is that sound?

1229
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,420
What's that sound?

1230
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,820
(Is it the sound of a baby crying?)

1231
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:05,920
(It's time to pass the patient's room.)

1232
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,950
What's that sound?

1233
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:11,020
My goodness.

1234
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:15,550
(The silence feels eerie.)

1235
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,650
Please let us pass.

1236
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,550
(He begs the ghosts.)

1237
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:23,290
What's going on? What's that?

1238
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:24,850
I think your name tag is inside.

1239
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:26,250
Where?

1240
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:27,650
- It's inside. - Where?

1241
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:29,050
There's your name tag.

1242
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:32,490
(They find someone's name tag.)

1243
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:34,690
- Where is it? - It's inside.

1244
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,350
(Screaming)

1245
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:41,520
What's this?

1246
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,390
There's a name tag inside.

1247
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:46,220
Why is it inside?

1248
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:48,750
- Your name tag is inside. - So Min.

1249
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,690
Your name tag is inside.

1250
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,390
(Mommy said we need to find our name tags.)

1251
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,150
It's inside.

1252
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,320
- It's inside. - I can't go.

1253
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,450
You must take your name tag.

1254
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:04,390
Stop crying.

1255
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:08,320
Your name tag is inside, but the bed is moving.

1256
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,520
The bed inside is moving.

1257
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,450
How will you take your name tag? You need it.

1258
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:18,090
I don't know whose it is.

1259
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:21,720
It's Se Chan's. Let's pass.

1260
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,920
- They found yours. - They found mine.

1261
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,090
It's somewhere visible.

1262
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:26,490
It's Se Chan's.

1263
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:28,520
Let's hide his name tag.

1264
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:31,390
(Let's hide it somewhere deep.)

1265
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:32,590
- What? - Let's hide it.

1266
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:34,050
Hide his name tag?

1267
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:35,420
(She's still sly.)

1268
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:36,850
- She said to hide yours. - What?

1269
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:39,690
- So Min said that. - What's wrong with her?

1270
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:42,350
My goodness.

1271
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,390
- Where's Se Chan's? - How about...

1272
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:47,450
My goodness. There's no one here.

1273
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:48,590
That startled me.

1274
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:51,920
(She makes sure to take care of the name tag.)

1275
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:53,450
I hid it.

1276
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:56,250
(When will they get to leave?)

1277
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,050
- Gosh. - Where do we have to go?

1278
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,150
- Come this way. - We should go this way.

1279
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:01,490
- No. - There's an arrow.

1280
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,690
- We have to go in. - It's too narrow.

1281
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:06,720
What's going on here?

1282
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:09,050
What do we do?

1283
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:10,390
What is this?

1284
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,450
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1285
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:18,950
Where are you filming? Why are you looking away?

1286
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:21,490
- Jae Seok. - What on earth are you doing?

1287
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:22,520
(Screaming)

1288
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,350
Oh, my goodness.

1289
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:26,420
(Sighing)

1290
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,020
How can you film like that?

1291
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,850
Kwon Ryeol should go in first.

1292
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:33,750
- Come on. - You go in first.

1293
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:35,320
You should lead at least once.

1294
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,950
- Just this once. - I'm supposed to follow.

1295
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,990
Come on, Kwon Ryeol.

1296
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:40,720
Why are you sweating so much, Jae Seok?

1297
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,320
I'm so scared right now.

1298
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:47,620
What should we do? I'm about to lose it.

1299
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:51,250
(It's more difficult for those who are waiting.)

1300
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,250
(A baby crying)

1301
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,220
Is that a baby crying?

1302
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,690
A baby's crying?

1303
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:57,820
(It's a cry full of resentment.)

1304
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,620
- I thought it was a cat. - Can you turn it off?

1305
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,550
- Until when do we have to listen? - Please stop.

1306
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:07,890
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

1307
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:12,690
(She screams out her apologies.)

1308
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:16,490
(What is going on inside the Labyrinth?)

1309
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:19,120
I have a sore throat from screaming.

1310
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,690
(They finally leave the operating room.)

1311
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,220
(They can't get used to the fear.)

1312
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:25,850
This is so scary.

1313
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:30,520
- Gosh, it's a bed. - My goodness.

1314
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,190
I'm sweating so much.

1315
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,850
(Where is Jae Seok's name tag?)

1316
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:46,490
My goodness.

1317
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:48,090
(They are frightened again.)

1318
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:49,420
(Kwon Ryeol runs away.)

1319
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:52,220
- I'm so sorry. - Gosh.

1320
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:53,690
Please don't do this, sir.

1321
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:56,550
- I'm so sorry, sir. - Please don't do this.

1322
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,250
- Please. - I didn't do it.

1323
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,490
Please don't do this. I'm sorry.

1324
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:02,520
Please stop it.

1325
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:04,720
(They run away.)

1326
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:07,150
(Kwon Ryeol speaks gibberish.)

1327
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:09,050
Hurry up.

1328
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:10,690
(Kwon Ryeol loses them.)

1329
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:13,450
Come here now. Hurry up.

1330
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:16,550
My goodness.

1331
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,420
(Kwon Ryeol doesn't come, and So Min is crying.)

1332
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:22,890
Why is the man following us all the way here?

1333
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,850
- Please stop it. - Please.

1334
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,950
- Please don't come near us. - Kwon Ryeol.

1335
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:28,920
- Come here. - I'm serious.

1336
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,490
Where are you going?

1337
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:32,350
- Kwon Ryeol. - Hey.

1338
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:33,620
(This is real Running Man.)

1339
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,820
Sir, how far...

1340
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,390
How far will you follow us?

1341
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,120
How far will you follow us?

1342
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,120
That man keeps following us.

1343
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,890
Be careful of the stairs.

1344
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:44,920
Stop following us.

1345
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:46,290
Goodness.

1346
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:48,790
(They're getting exhausted.)

1347
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:54,790
Gosh, he keeps following us.

1348
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:56,020
- Gosh. - Hey.

1349
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:59,290
Isn't that too much? He followed us all the way here.

1350
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:02,850
How could you follow us all the way here?

1351
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:05,850
(Panting)

1352
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,920
Why were you all the way there?

1353
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,320
- How could you, Kwon Ryeol? - Seriously.

1354
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,950
You were doing this while we were here.

1355
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,550
How could you?

1356
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:19,320
(Everyone knows that he gets scared easily.)

1357
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:25,620
(He doesn't know what to do.)

1358
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:28,490
(Don't come near me.)

1359
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:32,250
(This is the most scared Kwon Ryeol has ever been.)

1360
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:34,650
(He follows.)

1361
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,020
- What? - What?

1362
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:42,920
- Come on, Kwon Ryeol. - What's wrong with you?

1363
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,550
You scare me even more.

1364
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:46,250
Didn't you hear that?

1365
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:47,850
What sound? It was you.

1366
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,490
It's the sound you made when you walked.

1367
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:52,290
(He gets scared by his own footsteps.)

1368
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:53,320
(They continue walking.)

1369
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,190
There are no stairs.

1370
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,520
Okay.

1371
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,750
Where's your name tag?

1372
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:03,720
I have to find it.

1373
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,490
(I want to find it and leave.)

1374
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:08,720
It seems suspicious that there's a cushion.

1375
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:12,990
Here it is.

1376
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,090
- Here it is. - There it is.

1377
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:18,820
(Screaming)

1378
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:21,320
- That startled me. - Stop it.

1379
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,620
My goodness.

1380
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:25,750
- I'll bring your name tag. - So Min.

1381
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:29,190
- Give it to me now. - So Min.

1382
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:31,350
- Please give it to me. - So Min.

1383
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,690
Hurry up.

1384
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:35,890
(Run away now.)

1385
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:37,690
- Wait a minute. - So Min.

1386
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:38,920
(The name tag is hard to get.)

1387
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,550
I almost died, So Min.

1388
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:43,090
- Thank you. - I was so frightened.

1389
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,690
Let's catch our breaths.

1390
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:50,290
- How far have we come? - My throat hurts.

1391
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:51,920
- How much farther must we go? - I don't know.

1392
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:55,350
(It's been 35 minutes.)

1393
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:57,050
There is no end.

1394
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:01,050
(How much longer must we listen to them?)

1395
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:02,450
"I'm sorry."

1396
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:06,050
I'm telling the truth.

1397
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:07,950
We went out of battery.

1398
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:11,050
(They went out of battery.)

1399
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,490
- Whose camera? - Both cameras went off.

1400
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:17,420
- Did yours turn off too? - You mean these cameras?

1401
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:18,650
(That's scary.)

1402
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,090
- What's going on? - Aren't the batteries charged?

1403
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:22,790
- When did you change them? - Before we started.

1404
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:24,390
- It hasn't been long. - Then what happened?

1405
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:25,450
Both cameras turned off.

1406
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:26,750
How about yours?

1407
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:28,390
(Both of the cameras turned off.)

1408
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:29,750
- What's going on? - How about mine?

1409
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:32,690
- Both of them? - Seok Jin and Kwang Soo's went off.

1410
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:33,750
The batteries were charged.

1411
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,220
(This has happened before.)

1412
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:38,650
(Whenever Running Man did a horror special, )

1413
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:42,950
(mysterious incidents happened.)

1414
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:45,250
(This time too?)

1415
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:47,250
The battery has run out?

1416
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,350
Why? When did you change it?

1417
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,490
- Right before coming here. - Right before coming here?

1418
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:53,250
How long does it usually last? An hour?

1419
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,350
It usually lasts a day.

1420
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:57,690
- And it's already out? - It hasn't even been 30 minutes.

1421
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:00,750
(The battery has run out after only an hour.)

1422
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:02,550
What's happening?

1423
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:04,120
- What's going on? - It really is out.

1424
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,120
Really?

1425
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,190
Why you of all people?

1426
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,390
Bad things usually happen to you.

1427
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:13,590
(The three members' energy is running out too.)

1428
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:17,420
(Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear has been waiting for today.)

1429
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:19,950
Let's hurry.

1430
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:21,350
(Let's hurry.)

1431
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:23,720
We must be finished.

1432
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:25,550
We must be finished.

1433
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,350
We must be finished. Here you go.

1434
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,120
Here you go. Please save us.

1435
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,320
- Save us. - Thank you.

1436
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,390
- Thank you. - Bye.

1437
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:33,520
Thank you.

1438
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:36,550
(They return the name tags.)

1439
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:38,020
Can we go out now? Thank you.

1440
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,150
Bye.

1441
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:41,650
(The gatekeeper shows them the way.)

1442
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:44,377
(We're safe now.)

1443
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,590
- No, it's not the end. - What is this?

1444
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,150
It should end here.

1445
00:56:53,175 --> 00:56:53,900
(Is this not the end?)

1446
00:56:54,283 --> 00:56:55,583
This place is weird.

1447
00:56:55,983 --> 00:56:57,083
Aren't we finished?

1448
00:56:57,553 --> 00:57:00,783
This seems to never end.

1449
00:57:00,783 --> 00:57:02,153
(They are not even halfway through yet.)

1450
00:57:03,423 --> 00:57:05,683
Aren't we finished?

1451
00:57:07,353 --> 00:57:09,353
When is this going to end?

1452
00:57:09,353 --> 00:57:11,683
(They arrive at a steel bridge.)

1453
00:57:12,353 --> 00:57:14,053
Your hands are sweaty.

1454
00:57:14,053 --> 00:57:15,083
(Nervous)

1455
00:57:15,083 --> 00:57:17,153
I'm sweating all over too.

1456
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,453
I have no energy left.

1457
00:57:22,723 --> 00:57:24,083
(Noises)

1458
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:25,523
Gosh!

1459
00:57:25,523 --> 00:57:26,823
My goodness!

1460
00:57:26,823 --> 00:57:28,453
(Running away)

1461
00:57:28,453 --> 00:57:32,553
(So Min's cameraman runs away.)

1462
00:57:32,553 --> 00:57:33,783
He's running away.

1463
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,783
Your cameraman is running away.

1464
00:57:35,783 --> 00:57:37,983
- Hey! - Are you leaving us behind?

1465
00:57:38,183 --> 00:57:39,453
Are you leaving us behind?

1466
00:57:39,453 --> 00:57:41,353
- Gosh! - Gosh!

1467
00:57:41,353 --> 00:57:43,283
(They're startled by a camerman who has been hiding.)

1468
00:57:43,283 --> 00:57:45,053
- Gosh. - Why are you doing this?

1469
00:57:45,053 --> 00:57:46,553
- Why did you run away alone? - My goodness.

1470
00:57:46,553 --> 00:57:48,483
- Why did you run away alone? - I can't believe you.

1471
00:57:48,483 --> 00:57:50,723
How could you leave us alone?

1472
00:57:50,723 --> 00:57:51,783
Gosh.

1473
00:57:51,783 --> 00:57:52,783
(Hello)

1474
00:57:53,783 --> 00:57:58,953
(They run away.)

1475
00:57:59,483 --> 00:58:02,883
- Where is Kwon Ryeol? - Where is Kwon Ryeol?

1476
00:58:02,883 --> 00:58:05,053
(Why am I left here?)

1477
00:58:05,723 --> 00:58:06,883
Where is he?

1478
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:09,083
I'm not one of them.

1479
00:58:09,983 --> 00:58:10,983
Kwon Ryeol!

1480
00:58:10,983 --> 00:58:12,953
(I'm just a staff member.)

1481
00:58:12,953 --> 00:58:14,553
(They just run away without Kwon Ryeol.)

1482
00:58:14,553 --> 00:58:16,683
- Gosh. - My goodness.

1483
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:19,083
Gosh!

1484
00:58:19,423 --> 00:58:22,353
- Guys. - What is this?

1485
00:58:22,353 --> 00:58:23,423
You two.

1486
00:58:24,183 --> 00:58:26,083
Guys. How could you?

1487
00:58:26,083 --> 00:58:27,323
(How can you do this?)

1488
00:58:27,323 --> 00:58:28,483
Hey.

1489
00:58:28,953 --> 00:58:30,653
You guys are unbelievable.

1490
00:58:31,453 --> 00:58:33,383
What are you doing?

1491
00:58:33,623 --> 00:58:36,983
Pull yourselves together.

1492
00:58:37,053 --> 00:58:39,653
What are you doing?

1493
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,183
Pull yourselves together.

1494
00:58:42,283 --> 00:58:43,923
Hey.

1495
00:58:43,983 --> 00:58:45,883
Kwon Ryeol, Si Yeon.

1496
00:58:45,883 --> 00:58:47,483
- Hey. - Pull yourselves together.

1497
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:49,783
We have to get out of this place.

1498
00:58:49,823 --> 00:58:52,683
We have to survive. Pull yourselves together.

1499
00:58:52,683 --> 00:58:54,123
Pull yourselves together, guys.

1500
00:58:54,253 --> 00:58:55,283
(Will they safely escape the place?)

1501
00:58:55,283 --> 00:58:57,023
My goodness.

1502
00:58:57,153 --> 00:58:58,583
I'm all sweaty.

1503
00:58:59,583 --> 00:59:01,123
They're screaming a lot.

1504
00:59:02,423 --> 00:59:05,683
(Team Happy Trip arrives.)

1505
00:59:05,983 --> 00:59:07,783
- How did it go? - Was it fun?

1506
00:59:08,423 --> 00:59:10,253
- Are you guys okay? - Some are in there right now.

1507
00:59:10,253 --> 00:59:13,253
- I heard them scream. - It sounds horrible.

1508
00:59:13,253 --> 00:59:15,523
- It's extremely scary. - What happened?

1509
00:59:15,523 --> 00:59:17,353
- What will happen? - What happened?

1510
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:19,653
Why do you look so thin?

1511
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:21,153
He's become thin.

1512
00:59:21,153 --> 00:59:22,253
I'm exhausted.

1513
00:59:22,353 --> 00:59:24,253
You seem to have gained weight.

1514
00:59:24,253 --> 00:59:25,883
We ate so much.

1515
00:59:25,883 --> 00:59:27,353
- We ate so much. - You know what?

1516
00:59:27,353 --> 00:59:29,723
The number of ghosts was decided by your expenditure.

1517
00:59:29,783 --> 00:59:31,583
What?

1518
00:59:32,123 --> 00:59:33,553
- Do you understand? - Is that true?

1519
00:59:33,553 --> 00:59:36,153
We'll see the maximum number of ghosts.

1520
00:59:36,153 --> 00:59:37,883
- Really? - You didn't know?

1521
00:59:37,883 --> 00:59:39,783
We just had beef.

1522
00:59:39,783 --> 00:59:40,783
Gosh.

1523
00:59:41,623 --> 00:59:43,923
It melted in our mouths.

1524
00:59:45,553 --> 00:59:46,583
Hold on.

1525
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,783
(It still hasn't ended.)

1526
00:59:48,783 --> 00:59:49,783
Gosh.

1527
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:51,153
There's something again.

1528
00:59:51,983 --> 00:59:53,553
There's something over there.

1529
00:59:53,553 --> 00:59:58,153
(An evil ghost is wandering in the hallway.)

1530
00:59:58,153 --> 00:59:59,283
(What should we do?)

1531
00:59:59,283 --> 01:00:01,553
- My goodness. - Let's run.

1532
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:02,883
Let's run.

1533
01:00:02,883 --> 01:00:04,583
Let's run. We have no choice.

1534
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:05,883
Let's run all together.

1535
01:00:05,883 --> 01:00:07,823
- There's no other way. - Let's run.

1536
01:00:07,983 --> 01:00:10,383
- Let's run. - Let's run.

1537
01:00:10,383 --> 01:00:11,523
Let's run to the end of the hallway.

1538
01:00:11,883 --> 01:00:13,083
There's no other way.

1539
01:00:13,523 --> 01:00:15,923
Let's see.

1540
01:00:18,053 --> 01:00:19,253
My goodness.

1541
01:00:19,253 --> 01:00:21,523
- Let's run. - This is too much.

1542
01:00:21,523 --> 01:00:25,883
(The ghost is watching them.)

1543
01:00:25,883 --> 01:00:27,753
Let's... Let's run.

1544
01:00:28,723 --> 01:00:33,383
(They are extremely nervous.)

1545
01:00:33,383 --> 01:00:34,783
1, 2, 3.

1546
01:00:34,783 --> 01:00:36,153
Run!

1547
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:44,783
(The ghosts are behind them.)

1548
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:49,423
(Where is the exit?)

1549
01:00:50,553 --> 01:00:52,523
(So Min's cameraman comes out first.)

1550
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:53,983
So Min!

1551
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,783
(Jae Seok and So Min are finished.)

1552
01:00:55,783 --> 01:00:57,253
What's wrong?

1553
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:59,583
What happened?

1554
01:01:00,483 --> 01:01:02,523
- Jae Seok. - So Min.

1555
01:01:02,883 --> 01:01:04,383
What happened?

1556
01:01:04,553 --> 01:01:06,083
What's going on?

1557
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:07,923
- What's wrong? - What happened?

1558
01:01:08,423 --> 01:01:09,553
What's wrong?

1559
01:01:09,623 --> 01:01:10,823
He's sweating.

1560
01:01:10,823 --> 01:01:11,983
He's covered in sweat.

1561
01:01:11,983 --> 01:01:13,623
He's all sweaty. His clothes are wet.

1562
01:01:13,623 --> 01:01:14,883
His clothes are all wet.

1563
01:01:14,883 --> 01:01:17,223
How scary was it?

1564
01:01:17,323 --> 01:01:19,553
Get up.

1565
01:01:20,883 --> 01:01:21,883
You won't be able to escape.

1566
01:01:21,883 --> 01:01:23,423
- Sit on a chair. - You can't go alone.

1567
01:01:23,883 --> 01:01:24,883
You can't go alone.

1568
01:01:24,883 --> 01:01:26,723
Kwang Soo can't go alone.

1569
01:01:26,723 --> 01:01:27,983
He can't?

1570
01:01:30,423 --> 01:01:32,123
- Gosh. - How was it?

1571
01:01:32,323 --> 01:01:33,583
We heard you scream.

1572
01:01:33,583 --> 01:01:35,923
- We heard something. - So Min, you've become thinner.

1573
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:38,623
Why did you keep apologizing?

1574
01:01:38,683 --> 01:01:41,283
- I heard, "I'm sorry." - Go in.

1575
01:01:41,283 --> 01:01:42,523
- Just go in. - Was it that bad?

1576
01:01:42,523 --> 01:01:44,283
- Just go in. - Is it unimaginable?

1577
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:45,453
My goodness.

1578
01:01:45,453 --> 01:01:47,323
It never ends. It's so scary.

1579
01:01:47,353 --> 01:01:49,253
Do you know what's scary?

1580
01:01:49,553 --> 01:01:52,353
Two cameras suddenly ran out of battery.

1581
01:01:52,353 --> 01:01:55,723
That can happen if they weren't charged properly.

1582
01:01:55,723 --> 01:01:56,723
That's not it.

1583
01:01:56,723 --> 01:01:59,553
(Jae Seok...)

1584
01:01:59,783 --> 01:02:01,883
Seok Jin is angry.

1585
01:02:01,883 --> 01:02:03,453
He looks annoyed.

1586
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:06,183
He's seriously annoyed.

1587
01:02:06,183 --> 01:02:08,423
- He really is annoyed. - Let it go, Seok Jin.

1588
01:02:08,623 --> 01:02:10,883
That can happen.

1589
01:02:10,883 --> 01:02:12,523
That punk.

1590
01:02:13,323 --> 01:02:15,583
- He should become possessed. - The ghosts follow you all the way.

1591
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:17,783
They don't leave after startling you. They follow you.

1592
01:02:17,783 --> 01:02:19,883
- They follow you all the way. - They follow you all the way.

1593
01:02:21,723 --> 01:02:25,183
Now, Se Chan and Seok Jin will enter.

1594
01:02:25,183 --> 01:02:27,523
(It's Seok Jin and Se Chan's turn.)

1595
01:02:27,523 --> 01:02:28,983
We can do this.

1596
01:02:29,983 --> 01:02:31,983
- We can do this. - We can do this.

1597
01:02:33,253 --> 01:02:34,553
It looks so creepy.

1598
01:02:34,553 --> 01:02:35,553
(Hold on.)

1599
01:02:36,523 --> 01:02:38,983
(I have something to tell you.)

1600
01:02:38,983 --> 01:02:40,353
Will it be okay?

1601
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:41,823
Are you going in?

1602
01:02:41,823 --> 01:02:46,383
(Jong Kook stops Seok Jin and Se Chan.)

1603
01:02:46,623 --> 01:02:50,953
(What does Jong Kook want to say to them?)

1604
01:02:50,953 --> 01:02:52,553
What is he doing?

1605
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:54,383
(I want to capture this moment.)

1606
01:02:54,383 --> 01:02:55,823
Are you taking a selfie?

1607
01:02:55,823 --> 01:02:58,083
- What is he doing? - Gosh.

1608
01:02:58,153 --> 01:02:59,823
(Good luck in the Labyrinth.)

1609
01:03:00,553 --> 01:03:03,153
Do you want to remember this moment?

1610
01:03:03,153 --> 01:03:04,723
- Are you a tourist? - Come here.

1611
01:03:05,153 --> 01:03:06,883
What is with him?

1612
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:08,323
Why are you taking a picture?

1613
01:03:09,483 --> 01:03:10,723
Do you want to fight with me?

1614
01:03:10,723 --> 01:03:12,583
(Seok Jin wants to fight him.)

1615
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:16,553
Sure.

1616
01:03:16,553 --> 01:03:19,583
(He accepts the challenge.)

1617
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:22,183
That sounds good. I've been bored all day.

1618
01:03:22,183 --> 01:03:23,323
I'd rather go in there.

1619
01:03:23,323 --> 01:03:24,983
(Seok Jin's afraid of him.)

1620
01:03:25,453 --> 01:03:26,453
Wait.

1621
01:03:26,453 --> 01:03:27,683
(They go in to meet the ghosts.)

1622
01:03:27,683 --> 01:03:29,083
Here we go.

1623
01:03:29,083 --> 01:03:30,683
Let's go.

1624
01:03:30,683 --> 01:03:32,283
That place looks suspicious.

1625
01:03:32,283 --> 01:03:33,283
I don't think so.

1626
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:36,053
- Stop it. We haven't even started. - Stay still.

1627
01:03:36,053 --> 01:03:37,983
- Hold on. - Nothing will happen.

1628
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,253
Why do you walk so quickly?

1629
01:03:39,253 --> 01:03:41,553
It's okay. We're just starting here.

1630
01:03:41,553 --> 01:03:43,623
This part seems safe.

1631
01:03:43,623 --> 01:03:45,883
- It'll be okay. - That's not what I'm talking about.

1632
01:03:48,353 --> 01:03:49,423
Let's go.

1633
01:03:49,483 --> 01:03:50,523
Why do you walk before me?

1634
01:03:50,523 --> 01:03:51,553
Let's walk together.

1635
01:03:51,553 --> 01:03:53,723
(Their steps look so desperate.)

1636
01:03:53,953 --> 01:03:57,983
(Dance with the ghosts in the Labyrinth.)

1637
01:03:58,053 --> 01:04:00,783
(Don't let go of my hands.)

1638
01:04:02,953 --> 01:04:05,083
(It looks like they're dancing the tango.)

1639
01:04:05,083 --> 01:04:07,083
Please don't show up.

1640
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:09,053
I think this part is safe.

1641
01:04:09,483 --> 01:04:10,683
(They drag their feet.)

1642
01:04:10,953 --> 01:04:13,153
It's okay. Stop it.

1643
01:04:13,153 --> 01:04:15,253
- I can't do this. - It'll be all right.

1644
01:04:15,253 --> 01:04:16,823
I can't walk.

1645
01:04:16,823 --> 01:04:18,123
Seriously.

1646
01:04:18,523 --> 01:04:19,753
Walk.

1647
01:04:20,183 --> 01:04:21,183
(Thump)

1648
01:04:22,053 --> 01:04:23,083
(Their cameras hit each other.)

1649
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:24,783
Gosh!

1650
01:04:25,553 --> 01:04:27,083
It was just our cameras.

1651
01:04:27,683 --> 01:04:29,953
I can't go in.

1652
01:04:29,953 --> 01:04:31,523
Come on.

1653
01:04:31,523 --> 01:04:33,423
My goodness.

1654
01:04:33,423 --> 01:04:34,683
We haven't even started.

1655
01:04:34,683 --> 01:04:35,983
Let's go in.

1656
01:04:35,983 --> 01:04:37,583
Let's go.

1657
01:04:37,953 --> 01:04:39,723
- Okay, okay. - Okay.

1658
01:04:39,823 --> 01:04:41,583
Welcome.

1659
01:04:43,183 --> 01:04:44,183
What's that?

1660
01:04:44,183 --> 01:04:45,253
(He's an employee.)

1661
01:04:45,253 --> 01:04:46,983
(Screaming)

1662
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:47,983
(It's just a flashlight.)

1663
01:04:47,983 --> 01:04:50,383
Why? What happened?

1664
01:04:52,353 --> 01:04:53,583
It's broken.

1665
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:55,353
You broke it.

1666
01:04:55,883 --> 01:04:59,183
(They broke the only light they have.)

1667
01:05:01,083 --> 01:05:02,953
How will Kwang Soo do this alone?

1668
01:05:03,223 --> 01:05:04,853
How will Kwang Soo do this alone?

1669
01:05:05,223 --> 01:05:09,223
(Exactly)

1670
01:05:09,653 --> 01:05:11,323
"How will Kwang Soo do this alone?"

1671
01:05:12,383 --> 01:05:15,723
(Why?)

1672
01:05:15,723 --> 01:05:19,523
(Why are you giving me this ordeal?)

1673
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,253
- Something's here. - Seok Jin.

1674
01:05:22,253 --> 01:05:24,423
You're walking too slowly. It's too hard for me.

1675
01:05:24,423 --> 01:05:25,953
- What? - It's too hard for me.

1676
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:28,153
- Why? - You're too slow.

1677
01:05:28,153 --> 01:05:29,383
(They finally arrive at the entrance.)

1678
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:31,323
Seok Jin, I have a bad feeling about this.

1679
01:05:31,623 --> 01:05:33,223
- Something's going to come out. - Exactly.

1680
01:05:34,523 --> 01:05:35,753
Excuse me!

1681
01:05:35,753 --> 01:05:36,823
(Who's there?)

1682
01:05:37,583 --> 01:05:39,453
I can't do this.

1683
01:05:40,183 --> 01:05:42,523
(There has to be something here.)

1684
01:05:42,523 --> 01:05:43,753
(Peekaboo)

1685
01:05:44,753 --> 01:05:47,523
(Screaming)

1686
01:05:48,723 --> 01:05:51,523
(It sounds like one voice.)

1687
01:05:51,883 --> 01:05:53,183
(They look like a fantastic duo.)

1688
01:05:53,183 --> 01:05:56,083
- That hurts. - I bumped into this.

1689
01:05:57,883 --> 01:06:00,023
(Shrieking)

1690
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:01,383
(What's going on?)

1691
01:06:01,383 --> 01:06:04,023
- Who's that? - Are they getting eaten alive?

1692
01:06:04,123 --> 01:06:06,053
It sounds like they're playing a tug of war.

1693
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:08,183
Why are they yelling at the same time?

1694
01:06:08,183 --> 01:06:09,453
(Among all the laughter, )

1695
01:06:09,453 --> 01:06:13,253
(one person refuses to even smile.)

1696
01:06:13,253 --> 01:06:15,083
(How will Kwang Soo do it solo?)

1697
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:16,383
Kwang Soo.

1698
01:06:16,883 --> 01:06:18,123
This is driving me nuts.

1699
01:06:18,123 --> 01:06:22,153
(What in the world is in the Labyrinth.)

1700
01:06:22,153 --> 01:06:23,583
Cameraman Yoon Sang asked,

1701
01:06:23,683 --> 01:06:25,723
"I can come out if I find my name tag, right?

1702
01:06:25,723 --> 01:06:29,153
(Yoon Sang is Kwang Soo's cameraman.)

1703
01:06:29,153 --> 01:06:33,353
(Excuse me, sir?)

1704
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,683
They're the same.

1705
01:06:36,683 --> 01:06:39,223
(He's been Kwang Soo's cameraman for 7 years.)

1706
01:06:39,223 --> 01:06:41,053
I won't come out by myself.

1707
01:06:43,483 --> 01:06:44,783
I won't come out. I promise.

1708
01:06:45,783 --> 01:06:48,083
After 10 minutes, both Kwon Ryeol and Si Yeon...

1709
01:06:49,283 --> 01:06:51,253
(Screaming)

1710
01:06:51,553 --> 01:06:52,923
- What was that? - That startled me.

1711
01:06:52,923 --> 01:06:54,053
That startled me.

1712
01:06:55,223 --> 01:06:58,753
(What? It's Seok Jin's cameraman.)

1713
01:06:58,753 --> 01:06:59,883
Who's that?

1714
01:07:00,323 --> 01:07:01,583
(Their hearts almost dropped.)

1715
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:02,983
- Who's that? - That startled me.

1716
01:07:02,983 --> 01:07:04,383
- I'm startled. - He came out?

1717
01:07:04,883 --> 01:07:06,783
- He came out? - He came out by himself?

1718
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:09,553
- That scared me. - Hey...

1719
01:07:09,553 --> 01:07:11,253
(How did he come out without Seok Jin?)

1720
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:13,883
(10 minutes ago at the operating room)

1721
01:07:13,883 --> 01:07:15,083
Whose is this?

1722
01:07:15,853 --> 01:07:18,253
(The cameraman found his own name tag.)

1723
01:07:18,423 --> 01:07:20,883
Whose is this?

1724
01:07:21,383 --> 01:07:23,123
- What does it say? - Let's see.

1725
01:07:23,823 --> 01:07:25,153
Bye.

1726
01:07:25,153 --> 01:07:26,953
- Hey, hey. - Where are you going?

1727
01:07:27,153 --> 01:07:29,483
- Hey! - Yoo Seok is gone.

1728
01:07:29,483 --> 01:07:31,123
- Darn it. - That loser.

1729
01:07:31,853 --> 01:07:33,753
- Here's your camera. - Are you...

1730
01:07:33,753 --> 01:07:34,923
(The filming must continue.)

1731
01:07:34,923 --> 01:07:36,783
Are you out of your mind?

1732
01:07:37,723 --> 01:07:39,423
Don't go! Hey!

1733
01:07:39,583 --> 01:07:40,823
What's wrong with him?

1734
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:44,493
(I wish you luck, Seok Jin.)

1735
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:45,583
(This is the story of his survival.)

1736
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:46,653
He came out by himself?

1737
01:07:46,653 --> 01:07:49,053
I thought he was a white-haired witch.

1738
01:07:49,083 --> 01:07:50,083
(Today's lesson: Beware of people closest to you.)

1739
01:07:50,083 --> 01:07:52,353
- You're supposed to come out here. - That scared me.

1740
01:07:52,353 --> 01:07:55,123
- That startled me. - Hey.

1741
01:07:55,723 --> 01:07:57,153
You're supposed to come out that way.

1742
01:07:57,153 --> 01:07:58,183
(Kwang Soo is about to faint.)

1743
01:07:58,553 --> 01:08:01,923
- This is no joke. You should leave. - This is no joke.

1744
01:08:01,923 --> 01:08:03,553
(He is worried sick.)

1745
01:08:03,553 --> 01:08:05,823
Yoon Sang. You won't, right?

1746
01:08:06,453 --> 01:08:08,123
- I won't betray you. - I beg you.

1747
01:08:08,123 --> 01:08:09,583
- Really? - I won't.

1748
01:08:09,653 --> 01:08:12,383
- You know I trust you, right? - I won't betray you.

1749
01:08:12,383 --> 01:08:13,623
I'm serious.

1750
01:08:14,653 --> 01:08:15,993
(Seok Jin, can you hold my hand?)

1751
01:08:15,993 --> 01:08:17,223
- What? - Hold my hand.

1752
01:08:17,223 --> 01:08:18,623
Are you scared?

1753
01:08:18,623 --> 01:08:20,353
(The cameraman left inside is also a big coward.)

1754
01:08:20,853 --> 01:08:22,123
Is that a person?

1755
01:08:22,123 --> 01:08:23,253
No, Seok Jin.

1756
01:08:24,353 --> 01:08:25,553
No, Seok Jin.

1757
01:08:27,423 --> 01:08:30,923
(This is the first ghost after Yoo Seok left.)

1758
01:08:30,923 --> 01:08:35,653
(They unite in face of crisis.)

1759
01:08:37,183 --> 01:08:41,853
(Friendship is about running together.)

1760
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:47,123
(They have a shared fate whether they want it or not.)

1761
01:08:48,383 --> 01:08:52,353
(They leap in circles.)

1762
01:08:55,123 --> 01:08:59,183
(It's impossible to film properly.)

1763
01:08:59,183 --> 01:09:00,523
This is crazy.

1764
01:09:01,683 --> 01:09:03,823
- Don't do that. - Don't!

1765
01:09:03,823 --> 01:09:05,253
Don't do that. Stop following us.

1766
01:09:05,253 --> 01:09:06,493
(Why did Yoo Seok leave them with a camera?)

1767
01:09:06,493 --> 01:09:08,183
Why did he leave his camera?

1768
01:09:09,723 --> 01:09:11,153
Can we sit down?

1769
01:09:11,383 --> 01:09:13,493
- Excuse me. - What is wrong with you?

1770
01:09:13,953 --> 01:09:15,023
Excuse me!

1771
01:09:18,523 --> 01:09:20,123
Why did he leave his camera with me?

1772
01:09:20,123 --> 01:09:21,183
(30 minutes have passed.)

1773
01:09:21,183 --> 01:09:23,153
- It's a hallway? - Why is the hallway so long?

1774
01:09:23,883 --> 01:09:25,753
(Shaking)

1775
01:09:25,753 --> 01:09:27,023
Why is the flashlight out?

1776
01:09:27,023 --> 01:09:29,183
- It's out of battery. - Slow down.

1777
01:09:30,553 --> 01:09:33,023
(Se Chan found his name tag by a moving bed.)

1778
01:09:33,023 --> 01:09:34,923
- I love you. - Welcome.

1779
01:09:35,153 --> 01:09:36,753
Come. Don't push me.

1780
01:09:36,853 --> 01:09:39,383
Please don't push me.

1781
01:09:39,853 --> 01:09:41,523
Who's that? Is that a person?

1782
01:09:44,993 --> 01:09:47,353
(It's a ghost.)

1783
01:09:48,853 --> 01:09:55,553
(The three friends are united again.)

1784
01:09:55,553 --> 01:09:57,553
(Let me be your friend too.)

1785
01:09:58,353 --> 01:10:00,253
That hurts, Sung Oh.

1786
01:10:00,253 --> 01:10:01,783
- My name tag. - That hurts, Seok Jin.

1787
01:10:02,123 --> 01:10:03,423
- That hurts. - My name tag.

1788
01:10:03,423 --> 01:10:04,923
- My name tag. - Let go.

1789
01:10:04,923 --> 01:10:06,883
- Hold on. - Come.

1790
01:10:09,283 --> 01:10:11,083
- Sung Oh. - That hurts.

1791
01:10:11,723 --> 01:10:13,223
This is crazy!

1792
01:10:13,223 --> 01:10:15,383
(This is crazy!)

1793
01:10:15,383 --> 01:10:17,553
Seok Jin just sounded like his mom.

1794
01:10:20,153 --> 01:10:21,683
(Seok Jin found his name tag.)

1795
01:10:21,683 --> 01:10:24,123
They won't let you go without your name tag.

1796
01:10:24,523 --> 01:10:25,553
Thank you.

1797
01:10:25,823 --> 01:10:28,353
Really? How do we go? It won't open.

1798
01:10:28,353 --> 01:10:30,583
(The gatekeeper shows them the way.)

1799
01:10:30,583 --> 01:10:32,553
(Is it over?)

1800
01:10:32,553 --> 01:10:33,683
Really?

1801
01:10:34,353 --> 01:10:39,753
(Only the viewers know the truth.)

1802
01:10:39,753 --> 01:10:40,883
Something's coming.

1803
01:10:40,883 --> 01:10:44,723
(It's not over yet.)

1804
01:10:46,883 --> 01:10:50,523
(Run until the end.)

1805
01:10:52,353 --> 01:10:58,383
(Three friends come out together.)

1806
01:10:58,383 --> 01:11:00,283
(I won't film something like this again.)

1807
01:11:00,283 --> 01:11:01,993
This is crazy.

1808
01:11:01,993 --> 01:11:04,023
- Yellow-haired guy! - My gosh.

1809
01:11:04,823 --> 01:11:07,153
- What was that for? - Hey, you.

1810
01:11:07,353 --> 01:11:10,153
- What was this for? - That was so heavy to carry.

1811
01:11:10,153 --> 01:11:11,283
You should have taken it with you.

1812
01:11:11,283 --> 01:11:12,683
Come on, Yoo Seok.

1813
01:11:13,083 --> 01:11:16,253
Seok Jin dropped the flashlight in the beginning and broke it.

1814
01:11:16,683 --> 01:11:19,493
I kept on pressing it...

1815
01:11:19,683 --> 01:11:21,553
for 30 minutes.

1816
01:11:21,553 --> 01:11:23,923
This made it worse. It kept on going on and off.

1817
01:11:24,583 --> 01:11:25,753
It was like a strobe light.

1818
01:11:26,383 --> 01:11:28,023
It's more scary because the ghosts come and go.

1819
01:11:28,323 --> 01:11:30,623
Usually you see the ghosts like this,

1820
01:11:30,623 --> 01:11:32,623
but because of the light effect, they looked like this.

1821
01:11:32,623 --> 01:11:33,683
(Dancing)

1822
01:11:33,683 --> 01:11:36,683
(It was as if the ghosts were clubbing.)

1823
01:11:37,083 --> 01:11:38,683
I almost died.

1824
01:11:38,683 --> 01:11:41,493
(Seok Jin and Se Chan's scary trip is over.)

1825
01:11:42,053 --> 01:11:43,493
Drink some water.

1826
01:11:43,783 --> 01:11:45,353
- Let's go, Yoon Sang. - Kwang Soo.

1827
01:11:45,353 --> 01:11:47,583
- Good luck, Kwang Soo. - See you later.

1828
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:49,153
- See you later. - What's this?

1829
01:11:50,823 --> 01:11:53,153
- Come on. - Why are you doing this?

1830
01:11:53,153 --> 01:11:55,183
- That's so mean. - What's this for?

1831
01:11:55,423 --> 01:11:57,423
- What are you doing? - Why?

1832
01:11:57,783 --> 01:12:00,493
(Don't wet yourself, Kwang Soo of 19 Slots.)

1833
01:12:01,723 --> 01:12:03,183
- You can do it. - They're nice in the beginning.

1834
01:12:03,183 --> 01:12:05,623
Be careful. If your cameraman finds his name tag,

1835
01:12:05,623 --> 01:12:07,453
he'll leave you with the camera.

1836
01:12:07,683 --> 01:12:09,523
It'll be hard to go by yourself.

1837
01:12:09,523 --> 01:12:11,153
- Right? - You can't go. You can't go alone.

1838
01:12:11,153 --> 01:12:12,683
It's hard to go alone.

1839
01:12:13,123 --> 01:12:17,683
(Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear makes you sigh and groan.)

1840
01:12:17,683 --> 01:12:19,253
I'm going insane.

1841
01:12:21,993 --> 01:12:27,383
(He feels helpless and fearful.)

1842
01:12:29,083 --> 01:12:30,583
(I have no choice.)

1843
01:12:30,583 --> 01:12:32,623
I have no choice. Yoon Sang.

1844
01:12:33,453 --> 01:12:35,453
Promise me you'll go with me, Yoon Sang.

1845
01:12:36,023 --> 01:12:39,153
Yoon Sang. Promise.

1846
01:12:39,753 --> 01:12:40,783
What's this?

1847
01:12:41,953 --> 01:12:44,423
Wait. Don't push me.

1848
01:12:44,423 --> 01:12:46,053
I'm not scared.

1849
01:12:46,053 --> 01:12:47,383
You can go first.

1850
01:12:47,553 --> 01:12:49,023
Let's go together.

1851
01:12:49,253 --> 01:12:50,783
I was the host for your wedding.

1852
01:12:50,953 --> 01:12:52,023
I'm okay.

1853
01:12:53,653 --> 01:12:57,993
(I did you a favor, so do me one.)

1854
01:12:57,993 --> 01:12:59,083
This is crazy.

1855
01:13:00,823 --> 01:13:03,283
You don't have to film me. Please go first.

1856
01:13:03,283 --> 01:13:04,583
(He doesn't need the camera.)

1857
01:13:05,683 --> 01:13:06,723
(He stops.)

1858
01:13:06,723 --> 01:13:07,783
Here.

1859
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:10,493
Can you peep with your camera?

1860
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:12,553
(He peeks with the camera.)

1861
01:13:12,553 --> 01:13:13,783
You don't have to film me.

1862
01:13:14,183 --> 01:13:15,323
- Is anybody there? - No.

1863
01:13:16,453 --> 01:13:17,553
(They move ahead.)

1864
01:13:17,553 --> 01:13:18,653
This is driving me nuts.

1865
01:13:18,653 --> 01:13:20,883
Yoon Sang, keep going. Please.

1866
01:13:20,883 --> 01:13:23,883
(Yoon Sang and Kwang Soo push each other and advance.)

1867
01:13:26,253 --> 01:13:27,853
I'm... I'm sorry.

1868
01:13:28,993 --> 01:13:31,553
(Coughing and gagging)

1869
01:13:32,423 --> 01:13:33,853
(He's about to throw up.)

1870
01:13:33,853 --> 01:13:35,623
I can't do this.

1871
01:13:35,623 --> 01:13:37,083
(He fakes an illness 5 minutes in.)

1872
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:38,183
I threw up.

1873
01:13:38,183 --> 01:13:39,283
(He acts like a baby.)

1874
01:13:39,283 --> 01:13:42,183
(He attempts to leave early by pretending to be sick.)

1875
01:13:42,183 --> 01:13:43,623
This isn't right.

1876
01:13:44,783 --> 01:13:45,823
Yoon Sang, please.

1877
01:13:46,623 --> 01:13:48,993
What's this? It's a tent.

1878
01:13:49,853 --> 01:13:54,653
(He enters the prop room.)

1879
01:13:54,653 --> 01:13:56,123
Is something here?

1880
01:13:57,493 --> 01:13:59,453
(Of course, there is.)

1881
01:14:00,283 --> 01:14:06,023
(You thought it was a tent, right? It's actually a ghost.)

1882
01:14:06,283 --> 01:14:08,423
Don't do that. Please.

1883
01:14:08,423 --> 01:14:10,493
I'm sorry!

1884
01:14:11,153 --> 01:14:12,523
Wait.

1885
01:14:12,523 --> 01:14:14,283
(Let me pass.)

1886
01:14:15,623 --> 01:14:20,053
(His sickness comes back after meeting the first ghost.)

1887
01:14:20,053 --> 01:14:21,723
Please. I won't do it.

1888
01:14:22,283 --> 01:14:24,353
Wait. Hold on.

1889
01:14:24,353 --> 01:14:25,953
Hold... Don't!

1890
01:14:26,183 --> 01:14:27,383
Just once.

1891
01:14:27,683 --> 01:14:29,423
Please wait a minute!

1892
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:30,523
(He's very polite.)

1893
01:14:31,823 --> 01:14:32,823
Stop.

1894
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:35,153
I'll go.

1895
01:14:35,153 --> 01:14:37,123
(Thanks to the ghost, he learns Japanese.)

1896
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:38,453
Please stop!

1897
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:40,723
Yoon Sang. Don't.

1898
01:14:40,723 --> 01:14:42,883
(It's like he's dancing to a beat.)

1899
01:14:46,853 --> 01:14:48,493
(A ghost calls for him.)

1900
01:14:48,493 --> 01:14:49,623
What was that?

1901
01:14:50,183 --> 01:14:51,323
I'm done for.

1902
01:14:51,323 --> 01:14:52,353
(Grabbing)

1903
01:14:52,883 --> 01:14:54,523
- That hurts. - I'm sorry.

1904
01:14:55,583 --> 01:15:00,323
(Kwang Soo hasn't moved an inch after cursing.)

1905
01:15:00,323 --> 01:15:01,493
Darn it.

1906
01:15:02,323 --> 01:15:05,123
(My gosh)

1907
01:15:05,123 --> 01:15:06,493
I don't think I can do this.

1908
01:15:07,923 --> 01:15:09,053
Something's here.

1909
01:15:09,423 --> 01:15:11,923
What is it? Somebody's lying down.

1910
01:15:12,423 --> 01:15:14,723
What's this? Somebody's lying down.

1911
01:15:14,723 --> 01:15:15,823
(He enters the operating room.)

1912
01:15:16,583 --> 01:15:18,823
Go, Yoon Sang. Go.

1913
01:15:18,823 --> 01:15:19,883
(Yoon Sang listens to him.)

1914
01:15:19,883 --> 01:15:20,883
Go, Yoon Sang.

1915
01:15:21,653 --> 01:15:22,683
Yoon Sang.

1916
01:15:22,683 --> 01:15:24,583
(Screaming)

1917
01:15:25,423 --> 01:15:28,323
(Kwang Soo is aghast.)

1918
01:15:28,323 --> 01:15:30,623
(Yoon Sang is scared even more.)

1919
01:15:31,783 --> 01:15:36,323
(It's a cowardly duo who gets scared over a mere sound.)

1920
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:38,753
My goodness.

1921
01:15:39,183 --> 01:15:40,623
I broke my leg.

1922
01:15:40,623 --> 01:15:42,423
(Here comes the 2nd illness.)

1923
01:15:43,493 --> 01:15:45,453
Excuse me, sir. Yoon Sang.

1924
01:15:45,783 --> 01:15:46,953
Sir...

1925
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,883
Please let me pass.

1926
01:15:49,493 --> 01:15:51,553
Can you go an inch forward?

1927
01:15:52,153 --> 01:15:55,323
Just here, Yoon Sang. I'll be in the front after this.

1928
01:15:55,583 --> 01:15:56,723
My gosh.

1929
01:15:57,223 --> 01:15:58,783
What's this stupid noise?

1930
01:15:59,153 --> 01:16:00,923
What's that noise?

1931
01:16:02,083 --> 01:16:04,083
(Shrieking)

1932
01:16:04,383 --> 01:16:06,683
(Falling)

1933
01:16:11,823 --> 01:16:14,583
(They bump into each other.)

1934
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:16,083
Please...

1935
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:19,453
(Whatever. Let's just take a rest.)

1936
01:16:21,023 --> 01:16:23,583
I hurt myself. I really did.

1937
01:16:23,683 --> 01:16:25,183
Producer Cheol Min!

1938
01:16:25,723 --> 01:16:28,253
(The audience breaks out in laughter.)

1939
01:16:28,253 --> 01:16:31,223
- He hurt himself? - I hurt myself. Cheol Min!

1940
01:16:31,783 --> 01:16:33,753
You stepped on me three times.

1941
01:16:34,153 --> 01:16:36,353
What happened? How did you step on me?

1942
01:16:36,353 --> 01:16:37,823
(Did I?)

1943
01:16:38,383 --> 01:16:40,783
Do you hear me, Cheol Min? We both broke our legs.

1944
01:16:41,853 --> 01:16:44,523
(They don't believe him at all.)

1945
01:16:44,523 --> 01:16:45,583
What?

1946
01:16:45,953 --> 01:16:48,153
There's a barbed wire fence. What do we do?

1947
01:16:48,153 --> 01:16:49,253
(They're still lost in the operating room.)

1948
01:16:49,253 --> 01:16:51,583
That scared me. I hear the sound again.

1949
01:16:52,383 --> 01:16:54,783
(Were you talking about me?)

1950
01:16:56,053 --> 01:16:58,423
Please. Please let me go, sir.

1951
01:16:58,423 --> 01:17:00,553
I'm Korean. Please.

1952
01:17:00,553 --> 01:17:03,183
Please let me go. Hold on.

1953
01:17:03,183 --> 01:17:04,883
Wait.

1954
01:17:04,883 --> 01:17:06,853
(Strangely, the ghost brings out his patriotism.)

1955
01:17:06,853 --> 01:17:09,023
Please. I'm sorry.

1956
01:17:10,023 --> 01:17:11,383
Thank you for the food.

1957
01:17:11,683 --> 01:17:13,523
I'll leave.

1958
01:17:13,853 --> 01:17:15,923
I'll go, sir.

1959
01:17:16,123 --> 01:17:18,253
Please let me rest. This is crazy.

1960
01:17:18,583 --> 01:17:21,323
Thank you... Please.

1961
01:17:22,283 --> 01:17:24,123
Wait.

1962
01:17:24,453 --> 01:17:25,883
They didn't see anything by the stairs.

1963
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:28,523
There's something here. They said there was nothing.

1964
01:17:29,123 --> 01:17:30,423
Gosh, So Min.

1965
01:17:31,283 --> 01:17:32,653
What? Me?

1966
01:17:32,653 --> 01:17:34,383
(It's just a doll.)

1967
01:17:36,023 --> 01:17:37,493
How are we supposed to pass?

1968
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:38,953
(I don't know.)

1969
01:17:38,953 --> 01:17:41,683
This is too much. How are we supposed to pass?

1970
01:17:41,883 --> 01:17:43,053
Hold on.

1971
01:17:43,223 --> 01:17:45,053
The ghost is right here. How do we go?

1972
01:17:45,053 --> 01:17:46,623
(Darn it.)

1973
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:48,083
What am I supposed to do?

1974
01:17:48,083 --> 01:17:51,053
(They've been peeking with the camera for a few minutes.)

1975
01:17:51,053 --> 01:17:52,883
I'll go.

1976
01:17:54,883 --> 01:17:55,883
(Please go.)

1977
01:17:55,883 --> 01:17:57,223
(I'll go.)

1978
01:17:57,953 --> 01:18:01,623
I'm by the stairs. I might roll down.

1979
01:18:03,583 --> 01:18:04,923
It sounds like a baby crying.

1980
01:18:06,153 --> 01:18:07,553
Is there something here?

1981
01:18:08,923 --> 01:18:11,053
I'm injured. I broke my leg.

1982
01:18:12,953 --> 01:18:14,223
I can't go here.

1983
01:18:15,883 --> 01:18:18,553
(The crying continues.)

1984
01:18:19,553 --> 01:18:21,153
The baby is crying.

1985
01:18:21,153 --> 01:18:22,853
(Please stop the baby from crying.)

1986
01:18:22,853 --> 01:18:24,883
(It makes us want to cry as well.)

1987
01:18:24,883 --> 01:18:26,083
This is driving me nuts.

1988
01:18:26,083 --> 01:18:28,353
The baby's crying. How are we supposed to pass?

1989
01:18:28,353 --> 01:18:30,353
(He's been repeating that a few times.)

1990
01:18:33,323 --> 01:18:34,623
Why is the baby crying?

1991
01:18:35,453 --> 01:18:37,753
(Why do you want to know that?)

1992
01:18:37,753 --> 01:18:39,383
Can you go in first? Yoon Sang.

1993
01:18:39,623 --> 01:18:41,153
I broke my elbow too.

1994
01:18:41,823 --> 01:18:42,883
Just once.

1995
01:18:43,883 --> 01:18:45,253
Is there a kid?

1996
01:18:46,123 --> 01:18:47,423
No, that's not it.

1997
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:49,553
I can't go in.

1998
01:18:51,493 --> 01:18:52,953
What then?

1999
01:18:53,223 --> 01:18:54,583
What do I do if you can't go in?

2000
01:18:55,223 --> 01:18:57,623
- You can go first. - You just have to turn.

2001
01:18:57,783 --> 01:18:58,883
I can't go.

2002
01:18:59,383 --> 01:19:01,123
Should we take a break? Should we sit down?

2003
01:19:01,123 --> 01:19:02,423
- Yes. - Should we sit down?

2004
01:19:02,553 --> 01:19:04,083
- Hold on. - Let's sit down.

2005
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:05,123
This is driving me nuts.

2006
01:19:06,083 --> 01:19:07,453
Please wait.

2007
01:19:08,283 --> 01:19:11,123
I hurt myself. I broke my leg.

2008
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:15,253
There's something here.

2009
01:19:15,253 --> 01:19:17,123
(They can't sit forever so they keep going.)

2010
01:19:17,123 --> 01:19:18,283
Is this the right way?

2011
01:19:18,283 --> 01:19:19,853
Yes, this is the door.

2012
01:19:19,853 --> 01:19:21,223
Let's hurry.

2013
01:19:22,223 --> 01:19:24,353
(Frowning)

2014
01:19:27,953 --> 01:19:30,153
(Why is there a hand?)

2015
01:19:30,153 --> 01:19:32,353
This won't do.

2016
01:19:33,553 --> 01:19:34,953
This won't do.

2017
01:19:34,953 --> 01:19:39,853
(He backs up quickly.)

2018
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:44,123
Okay.

2019
01:19:45,723 --> 01:19:46,783
Let's go.

2020
01:19:49,553 --> 01:19:53,153
(They came this far. A bloody hand can't stop them.)

2021
01:19:53,153 --> 01:19:56,623
(Let's not be cowards anymore and get through this.)

2022
01:19:57,323 --> 01:19:59,953
This... Yoon Sang, what do I do? This won't do.

2023
01:20:00,383 --> 01:20:02,493
What then? Wait.

2024
01:20:02,493 --> 01:20:03,653
(We should just go back, right?)

2025
01:20:04,553 --> 01:20:05,953
I think something's here.

2026
01:20:06,583 --> 01:20:08,283
What's going on?

2027
01:20:08,283 --> 01:20:09,753
- They're still far from done. - Can you...

2028
01:20:09,753 --> 01:20:11,823
just tell them to come out?

2029
01:20:12,323 --> 01:20:14,083
They're taking forever.

2030
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:16,583
(We may see sunrise at this rate.)

2031
01:20:17,353 --> 01:20:19,323
There's something here. Okay.

2032
01:20:20,353 --> 01:20:21,683
(He decides to go forward.)

2033
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:22,683
Let's go.

2034
01:20:24,423 --> 01:20:26,583
(He clenches his teeth and moves forward.)

2035
01:20:28,583 --> 01:20:30,923
Wait, sir. Can you let me pass?

2036
01:20:30,923 --> 01:20:32,823
(I think I need another break.)

2037
01:20:32,823 --> 01:20:34,023
Excuse me.

2038
01:20:34,023 --> 01:20:35,653
(Excuse me, Mr. Ghost.)

2039
01:20:35,653 --> 01:20:37,423
One chance.

2040
01:20:37,953 --> 01:20:40,053
Can you make them stop crying?

2041
01:20:40,453 --> 01:20:44,083
(They're not stopping.)

2042
01:20:44,083 --> 01:20:45,523
How are we supposed to pass?

2043
01:20:45,523 --> 01:20:47,783
- Let's go. We have no choice. - Go.

2044
01:20:47,783 --> 01:20:49,453
(Are you saying you can't go?)

2045
01:20:49,453 --> 01:20:50,683
Go.

2046
01:20:50,683 --> 01:20:52,853
Wheelchair, wheelchair!

2047
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:56,423
(It's the terrifying, wheelchair ghost.)

2048
01:20:56,753 --> 01:20:59,853
Please... Please wait!

2049
01:20:59,853 --> 01:21:02,953
Wait. Where is it going? Wait.

2050
01:21:02,953 --> 01:21:04,683
I'm sorry!

2051
01:21:04,683 --> 01:21:06,323
(He says, "Thank you," in Russian.)

2052
01:21:06,323 --> 01:21:07,553
Hold on!

2053
01:21:08,253 --> 01:21:11,223
Thank you. Please wait.

2054
01:21:12,253 --> 01:21:13,453
I'm sorry.

2055
01:21:13,453 --> 01:21:15,853
(This wheelchair ghost has a story.)

2056
01:21:16,323 --> 01:21:19,253
(The ghost was waiting for them all along.)

2057
01:21:19,253 --> 01:21:21,823
(It got sick of waiting, )

2058
01:21:21,823 --> 01:21:26,153
(so it came to meet them.)

2059
01:21:26,453 --> 01:21:27,723
I'm sorry.

2060
01:21:27,723 --> 01:21:29,223
(It's a very kind ghost.)

2061
01:21:29,223 --> 01:21:30,953
Don't. Stop.

2062
01:21:31,493 --> 01:21:35,023
Please, sir!

2063
01:21:37,383 --> 01:21:41,883
(I'm dying, Mom.)

2064
01:21:43,823 --> 01:21:45,383
(Goodness)

2065
01:21:45,383 --> 01:21:46,723
I'm sorry!

2066
01:21:46,753 --> 01:21:48,423
(I said, I was sorry!)

2067
01:21:48,923 --> 01:21:50,423
I can't pass.

2068
01:21:51,023 --> 01:21:53,123
Why do you keep saying that?

2069
01:21:53,123 --> 01:21:54,923
(Do you think I can?)

2070
01:21:54,923 --> 01:21:56,423
Let's go. We have no other choice.

2071
01:21:57,553 --> 01:21:58,753
Can you tell it to take a step back?

2072
01:21:58,753 --> 01:22:00,083
Can you take a step back?

2073
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:03,623
I'll pass.

2074
01:22:04,353 --> 01:22:05,423
I want to...

2075
01:22:05,423 --> 01:22:07,783
(It's Kwang Soo's free talking class.)

2076
01:22:07,783 --> 01:22:09,283
Please stop.

2077
01:22:09,283 --> 01:22:10,653
Please, sir.

2078
01:22:10,753 --> 01:22:13,053
Please move back. A little bit.

2079
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:14,683
Please move back a little bit.

2080
01:22:14,683 --> 01:22:16,353
Please move back a little bit.

2081
01:22:18,253 --> 01:22:21,053
Thank you so much.

2082
01:22:21,053 --> 01:22:23,853
(The wheelchair ghost actually moves back.)

2083
01:22:23,853 --> 01:22:25,683
Stop. Just once.

2084
01:22:26,123 --> 01:22:29,523
- How are we supposed to pass? - What's here? This is impossible.

2085
01:22:29,523 --> 01:22:32,623
(It's a moving bed after the wheelchair ghost.)

2086
01:22:32,623 --> 01:22:34,683
Bed, stop.

2087
01:22:35,623 --> 01:22:37,123
Bed, stop.

2088
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:40,083
(I'm back.)

2089
01:22:40,083 --> 01:22:43,283
It's over. It's over!

2090
01:22:43,283 --> 01:22:46,353
It's over. I saw you. What's wrong with you?

2091
01:22:46,553 --> 01:22:50,523
Sir, how long are you going to keep this up?

2092
01:22:51,053 --> 01:22:53,583
(Farewell doesn't mean forever.)

2093
01:22:53,583 --> 01:22:56,323
Sir, what do I have to do for you to stop?

2094
01:22:57,923 --> 01:22:59,993
If you need me to wet myself,

2095
01:23:00,723 --> 01:23:02,123
I can do that right now.

2096
01:23:03,423 --> 01:23:07,253
(We need to buy Kwang Soo new underwear.)

2097
01:23:09,423 --> 01:23:10,853
We need to find our name tags, Yoon Sang.

2098
01:23:10,853 --> 01:23:12,523
I haven't seen a single one.

2099
01:23:13,283 --> 01:23:17,153
(They have to find their name tags to escape from this darkness.)

2100
01:23:17,423 --> 01:23:20,023
(Kwang Soo finds his name tag.)

2101
01:23:23,623 --> 01:23:28,153
(Not only does he find his name tag, but he always finds a ghost.)

2102
01:23:29,283 --> 01:23:32,583
(Wailing)

2103
01:23:32,583 --> 01:23:34,153
(Yelling)

2104
01:23:34,153 --> 01:23:35,723
(Screaming)

2105
01:23:36,123 --> 01:23:37,723
(Laughing)

2106
01:23:37,723 --> 01:23:39,423
- He must hate it. - Is that an animal?

2107
01:23:39,423 --> 01:23:40,583
He must hate it.

2108
01:23:40,783 --> 01:23:43,223
I hate this. I hate this so much.

2109
01:23:44,583 --> 01:23:48,323
(Kwang Soo finds his name tag first.)

2110
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:50,253
(Let's go, Yoon Sang.)

2111
01:23:50,253 --> 01:23:51,553
That startled me. What's that?

2112
01:23:52,283 --> 01:23:53,783
- I can't do this. - What's that?

2113
01:23:53,783 --> 01:23:55,923
What should we do? Where are you going?

2114
01:23:56,353 --> 01:23:58,653
(Yoon Sang tries to quit in the middle.)

2115
01:23:58,653 --> 01:24:00,723
Where are you going? What's wrong?

2116
01:24:00,723 --> 01:24:03,183
What then? I found my name tag.

2117
01:24:03,583 --> 01:24:06,223
- I found it for you. - I can go back the way we came.

2118
01:24:06,923 --> 01:24:08,423
Just here.

2119
01:24:08,453 --> 01:24:09,823
You want me to go first?

2120
01:24:09,823 --> 01:24:10,853
(Please go first.)

2121
01:24:10,853 --> 01:24:13,323
- I'll just go back. - No, wait.

2122
01:24:13,323 --> 01:24:14,653
(I can just go back the way we came.)

2123
01:24:14,653 --> 01:24:15,823
Look.

2124
01:24:16,783 --> 01:24:18,183
(How am I supposed to go first?)

2125
01:24:18,183 --> 01:24:19,383
Let's go together.

2126
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:25,553
(Shrieking)

2127
01:24:25,553 --> 01:24:26,923
What? Why?

2128
01:24:28,153 --> 01:24:30,423
(This time around, he wants to know why the woman is screaming.)

2129
01:24:30,423 --> 01:24:31,923
We can't walk through.

2130
01:24:31,953 --> 01:24:33,583
(This time around, he wants to know why the woman is screaming.)

2131
01:24:34,453 --> 01:24:36,823
Why is she doing that?

2132
01:24:37,853 --> 01:24:39,153
This is insane.

2133
01:24:39,853 --> 01:24:42,223
(They finally enter the reception area.)

2134
01:24:42,223 --> 01:24:43,493
(I've been waiting for long.)

2135
01:24:43,493 --> 01:24:44,783
It's there.

2136
01:24:45,723 --> 01:24:46,853
How are we supposed to pass?

2137
01:24:47,023 --> 01:24:49,723
It's coming. It's coming!

2138
01:24:50,123 --> 01:24:52,493
(They back off again.)

2139
01:24:52,493 --> 01:24:54,423
My gosh.

2140
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:56,553
You can't do that from both sides.

2141
01:24:56,553 --> 01:24:57,753
(These cowards are stuck.)

2142
01:24:57,753 --> 01:24:59,453
You can't do that from both sides.

2143
01:25:01,023 --> 01:25:03,853
(He walks like an ape to try again.)

2144
01:25:03,853 --> 01:25:05,053
For goodness' sake.

2145
01:25:07,183 --> 01:25:08,953
This is insane.

2146
01:25:09,753 --> 01:25:10,783
What should we do?

2147
01:25:11,383 --> 01:25:12,383
What should we do?

2148
01:25:12,723 --> 01:25:14,083
I will do this.

2149
01:25:15,953 --> 01:25:17,923
(Running)

2150
01:25:19,553 --> 01:25:24,383
(The cowardly duo escapes the reception area at full speed.)

2151
01:25:24,383 --> 01:25:26,823
(Stomping)

2152
01:25:26,823 --> 01:25:29,323
(Is the ghost following them?)

2153
01:25:29,323 --> 01:25:30,653
("Fantastic Duo 2", coming up)

2154
01:25:31,583 --> 01:25:33,753
(The sentimental balladeer, Kim Yeon Woo's sad cry)

2155
01:25:33,753 --> 01:25:35,453
(Sir)

2156
01:25:35,453 --> 01:25:38,123
(When he called for "Sir", )

2157
01:25:38,123 --> 01:25:39,823
(Boohwal made a comeback.)

2158
01:25:39,823 --> 01:25:42,383
(Boohwal versus Kim Yeon Woo)

2159
01:25:43,123 --> 01:25:44,383
I will do this.

2160
01:25:46,223 --> 01:25:48,493
(Running)

2161
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:54,653
(The cowardly duo escapes the reception area at full speed.)

2162
01:25:54,653 --> 01:25:57,083
(Stomping)

2163
01:25:57,083 --> 01:26:00,823
(Is the ghost following them?)

2164
01:26:00,823 --> 01:26:03,953
(It's a cameraman.)

2165
01:26:03,953 --> 01:26:04,953
My goodness.

2166
01:26:04,953 --> 01:26:07,923
(After seeing ghosts, they are surprised by a cameraman.)

2167
01:26:07,923 --> 01:26:09,683
Don't do that.

2168
01:26:09,683 --> 01:26:10,753
Don't do that.

2169
01:26:11,323 --> 01:26:12,923
For goodness' sake.

2170
01:26:13,583 --> 01:26:16,023
(I have been here all along.)

2171
01:26:16,623 --> 01:26:19,123
It's a door. Push, push.

2172
01:26:19,123 --> 01:26:21,653
(Yoon Sang acquires his name tag on the way.)

2173
01:26:21,653 --> 01:26:27,023
(Unsurprisingly, another dreary place appears.)

2174
01:26:27,493 --> 01:26:29,053
Here we go again.

2175
01:26:29,853 --> 01:26:31,123
I don't even know anymore.

2176
01:26:32,283 --> 01:26:33,323
(The end is near.)

2177
01:26:33,323 --> 01:26:34,323
You can go first.

2178
01:26:34,323 --> 01:26:35,683
(But this red room stops them.)

2179
01:26:35,683 --> 01:26:36,723
Come on.

2180
01:26:37,523 --> 01:26:38,993
How will we go through?

2181
01:26:39,653 --> 01:26:41,123
- I can't do this. - For goodness' sake.

2182
01:26:41,123 --> 01:26:43,353
What do you suggest we do?

2183
01:26:43,553 --> 01:26:45,323
Do you want to live here forever?

2184
01:26:45,853 --> 01:26:47,353
We need to go.

2185
01:26:48,123 --> 01:26:50,553
Look at how tightly I am holding onto your name tag.

2186
01:26:51,523 --> 01:26:52,823
(The cowardly duo enters the stairs.)

2187
01:26:52,823 --> 01:26:54,183
I am sure we are almost done.

2188
01:26:54,383 --> 01:26:56,853
Can we sit down for a second? Let's hurry up and go.

2189
01:26:57,483 --> 01:26:59,423
Let's sit down for five seconds.

2190
01:27:00,223 --> 01:27:01,623
I can't do this.

2191
01:27:04,753 --> 01:27:06,553
Why couldn't I catch a king crab?

2192
01:27:09,223 --> 01:27:13,383
(He only caught strange sea creatures.)

2193
01:27:15,653 --> 01:27:16,723
(For goodness' sake.)

2194
01:27:18,423 --> 01:27:19,783
(Did you think he was a ghost?)

2195
01:27:19,783 --> 01:27:20,823
I can't do this anymore.

2196
01:27:20,823 --> 01:27:23,123
(The duo arrives before the gatekeeper.)

2197
01:27:24,023 --> 01:27:25,483
We must be at the end.

2198
01:27:25,723 --> 01:27:28,683
(Kwang Soo and Yoon Sang safely turn in their name tags.)

2199
01:27:28,683 --> 01:27:29,683
All right.

2200
01:27:31,853 --> 01:27:32,853
Can we go?

2201
01:27:33,753 --> 01:27:35,923
(Let's go together.)

2202
01:27:36,853 --> 01:27:37,853
Yoon Sang.

2203
01:27:37,853 --> 01:27:39,923
(Their pain will be over if they get out safely.)

2204
01:27:39,923 --> 01:27:40,923
This really is the end.

2205
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:41,923
(Their pain will be over if they get out safely.)

2206
01:27:43,583 --> 01:27:48,583
(A mysterious figure watches them from afar.)

2207
01:27:48,583 --> 01:27:50,683
Wait a minute. We found our name tags.

2208
01:27:51,223 --> 01:27:52,483
(We may be able to dodge him.)

2209
01:27:52,483 --> 01:27:53,823
Come on.

2210
01:27:54,953 --> 01:27:55,953
This is insane.

2211
01:27:55,953 --> 01:27:57,953
(We may be able to dodge him.)

2212
01:27:57,953 --> 01:27:59,323
(Let's try to talk to him.)

2213
01:28:01,423 --> 01:28:07,283
(The ghosts who are angry by the long wait run out.)

2214
01:28:08,123 --> 01:28:11,383
(They run as fast as they can.)

2215
01:28:12,883 --> 01:28:14,223
(The cowardly duo finally escapes.)

2216
01:28:14,223 --> 01:28:15,223
My goodness.

2217
01:28:15,223 --> 01:28:16,823
(The cowardly duo finally escapes.)

2218
01:28:18,953 --> 01:28:20,423
(He is utterly exhausted.)

2219
01:28:20,423 --> 01:28:21,953
Good work, Kwang Soo.

2220
01:28:21,953 --> 01:28:23,453
- Kwang Soo. - Good work, Kwang Soo.

2221
01:28:23,753 --> 01:28:29,823
(The duo held hands until the end and displayed their friendship.)

2222
01:28:31,323 --> 01:28:34,653
(The two cowards' epic escape of Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear ends.)

2223
01:28:35,083 --> 01:28:36,623
You did a good job. You are a true man.

2224
01:28:37,153 --> 01:28:38,783
You were speaking nonsense.

2225
01:28:39,453 --> 01:28:40,653
You were very cool, Kwang Soo.

2226
01:28:41,283 --> 01:28:43,383
It's over. It's over.

2227
01:28:43,923 --> 01:28:45,223
- Thank you for your hard work. - It's over.

2228
01:28:45,223 --> 01:28:46,853
We are done with Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.

2229
01:28:47,123 --> 01:28:51,323
With the tour of Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear,

2230
01:28:51,323 --> 01:28:54,723
Running Man's Global Project: Dangerous Tourist Attractions ended.

2231
01:28:55,353 --> 01:28:56,753
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

2232
01:28:56,753 --> 01:28:58,753
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

2233
01:28:58,753 --> 01:28:59,923
Thank you for your hard work.

2234
01:28:59,923 --> 01:29:00,983
Thank you for your hard work.

2235
01:29:01,223 --> 01:29:04,423
I will now reveal Running Man's new project.

2236
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:06,223
(Running Man's new project will be revealed.)

2237
01:29:07,683 --> 01:29:08,683
(Is there more?)

2238
01:29:08,683 --> 01:29:11,283
- Is there another project? - There are so many projects.

2239
01:29:11,923 --> 01:29:15,523
(They suddenly deliver...)

2240
01:29:15,523 --> 01:29:17,683
(a new project.)

2241
01:29:17,683 --> 01:29:19,523
Where are we going this time?

2242
01:29:19,823 --> 01:29:20,983
Will we start a new project right away?

2243
01:29:21,423 --> 01:29:23,483
1, 2, 3.

2244
01:29:24,023 --> 01:29:28,823
(What will it be...)

2245
01:29:28,823 --> 01:29:32,583
(this time?)

2246
01:29:32,583 --> 01:29:36,053
"People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent".

2247
01:29:38,323 --> 01:29:40,853
(People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent)

2248
01:29:40,853 --> 01:29:42,323
A Place for 1 Percent?

2249
01:29:42,323 --> 01:29:43,623
(People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent)

2250
01:29:43,623 --> 01:29:45,623
Running Man's new project is...

2251
01:29:45,623 --> 01:29:48,753
People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent.

2252
01:29:48,953 --> 01:29:52,053
Among the tourist attractions that are recommended by the viewers,

2253
01:29:52,183 --> 01:29:55,953
you will go to a place that is recommended by one percent.

2254
01:29:57,223 --> 01:30:00,623
We are currently receiving recommendations on our website.

2255
01:30:01,423 --> 01:30:04,953
The recommendations include Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia.

2256
01:30:04,953 --> 01:30:06,723
(The magical salt flats, Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia)

2257
01:30:08,323 --> 01:30:09,553
The Grand Canyon in the US.

2258
01:30:09,553 --> 01:30:11,283
(The nature the world loves, the Grand Canyon in the US)

2259
01:30:11,853 --> 01:30:13,423
Machu Picchu in Peru.

2260
01:30:13,423 --> 01:30:14,623
(The unsolved mystery of the nature, Machu Picchu in Peru)

2261
01:30:15,723 --> 01:30:18,623
And the boat tour at Iguazu Falls are among the many.

2262
01:30:19,753 --> 01:30:21,823
(The best tourist attractions in the world)

2263
01:30:22,953 --> 01:30:25,653
- Those places are very well known. - Those places are nice.

2264
01:30:25,653 --> 01:30:27,083
Those places are very well known.

2265
01:30:27,123 --> 01:30:28,123
However...

2266
01:30:28,123 --> 01:30:29,953
(However)

2267
01:30:30,123 --> 01:30:32,323
(However?)

2268
01:30:33,283 --> 01:30:36,723
Too many people suggested them, so those places were eliminated.

2269
01:30:36,723 --> 01:30:39,483
(The well known, tourist attractions are eliminated.)

2270
01:30:39,483 --> 01:30:41,953
(Which place for 1 percent will Running Man go to?)

2271

2272

(A taste of places for 1 percent, number 1)

2273
01:30:49,183 --> 01:30:51,623
Bonjour. Hello.

2274
01:30:51,623 --> 01:30:55,723
I am a viewer of Running Man who lives in Paris, Kim Cho Rong.

2275
01:30:55,753 --> 01:30:58,423
This place was recommended by Cho Rong.

2276
01:30:58,853 --> 01:31:02,553
The unique tourist attraction I recommend is...

2277
01:31:02,923 --> 01:31:05,123
the Catacombs of Paris,

2278
01:31:05,123 --> 01:31:08,723
which are underground ossuaries in the heart of Paris.

2279
01:31:10,853 --> 01:31:12,153
Ossuaries?

2280
01:31:12,453 --> 01:31:13,853
Why would you do that to us?

2281
01:31:13,853 --> 01:31:16,953
It has been less than a minute since I came out.

2282
01:31:17,483 --> 01:31:21,553
A myth says that inside, a gate to the underworld exists.

2283
01:31:21,823 --> 01:31:23,123
You must be careful...

2284
01:31:23,223 --> 01:31:25,523
because seeing the gatekeeper of the underworld...

2285
01:31:25,523 --> 01:31:27,723
means you will be dragged under.

2286
01:31:28,123 --> 01:31:29,383
Why would we go to the ossuaries?

2287
01:31:29,723 --> 01:31:31,183
This is a real place.

2288
01:31:31,183 --> 01:31:33,323
- This is ridiculous. - Some tourists have gone missing.

2289
01:31:33,323 --> 01:31:34,623
Why would we go there?

2290
01:31:34,683 --> 01:31:39,453
Come to the Catacombs of Paris for a scary experience this summer.

(A taste of places for 1 percent, number 2)

2292
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:50,483
Hello, I am a 28-year-old who lives in Seoul, Hong Se Hee.

2293
01:31:50,753 --> 01:31:54,783
I am sending a video because there is...

2294
01:31:54,783 --> 01:31:58,283
a tourist attraction I want you to visit in my place.

2295
01:31:58,653 --> 01:32:01,953
It's a ride that is located in Colorado, US,

2296
01:32:02,283 --> 01:32:05,583
called the Giant Canyon Swing.

2297
01:32:07,723 --> 01:32:10,723
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2298
01:32:10,723 --> 01:32:12,183
No, no, no, no.

2299
01:32:12,453 --> 01:32:14,183
- There is no way we can ride it. - It's impossible.

2300
01:32:14,183 --> 01:32:15,183
What is that?

2301
01:32:15,853 --> 01:32:20,153
It's so scary that even the designer of the ride only rode it once.

2302
01:32:21,083 --> 01:32:25,583
Simply put, it is like riding a swing on a cliff.

2303
01:32:26,753 --> 01:32:27,823
(Shocked)

2304
01:32:27,823 --> 01:32:29,523
There is no way we can ride it.

2305
01:32:29,523 --> 01:32:31,153
Even the designer of the ride couldn't ride it.

2306
01:32:32,223 --> 01:32:34,853
I can't ride it because I have a fear of heights.

2307
01:32:34,853 --> 01:32:39,483
It will be thrilling to see the members experience it.

2308
01:32:39,953 --> 01:32:41,483
Let's go, Running Man.

2309
01:32:42,523 --> 01:32:44,053
We all have a fear of heights.

2310
01:32:44,053 --> 01:32:45,783
We all do.

2311
01:32:46,523 --> 01:32:50,023
(A taste of places for 1 percent, number 3)

2312
01:32:50,123 --> 01:32:52,783
Hi, Running Man. My name is Abril Elguezabal.

2313
01:32:52,823 --> 01:32:55,823
I am 21 years old. I am from Mexico.

2314
01:32:55,823 --> 01:32:58,723
The place I want to recommend, Copper Canyon,

2315
01:32:58,723 --> 01:33:01,653
is an amazing place with an amazing view.

2316
01:33:03,723 --> 01:33:05,323
What is the place?

2317
01:33:05,323 --> 01:33:06,523
- Does it include rock climbing? - It looks very cool.

2318
01:33:06,523 --> 01:33:07,583
What is the place?

2319
01:33:08,123 --> 01:33:11,653
You can get on the zipline,

2320
01:33:11,723 --> 01:33:15,823
go to viewpoints, get on the cable car,

2321
01:33:16,223 --> 01:33:18,353
hanging bridges, and rappels.

2322
01:33:19,753 --> 01:33:20,923
It's a single-line zipline.

2323
01:33:21,923 --> 01:33:22,923
My goodness.

2324
01:33:23,323 --> 01:33:25,523
- We can't go on it. - Seriously.

2325
01:33:26,483 --> 01:33:27,583
That's impossible.

2326
01:33:28,283 --> 01:33:29,723
Why are you doing this to us?

2327
01:33:31,423 --> 01:33:34,653
(A taste of places for 1 percent, number 4)

2328
01:33:35,453 --> 01:33:38,383
Hello, I am Park Ji Ni from Seoul.

2329
01:33:38,623 --> 01:33:41,723
I recommend Crater of Diamonds State Park...

2330
01:33:41,753 --> 01:33:45,853
because you can keep the diamonds you find after paying seven dollars.

2331
01:33:46,223 --> 01:33:47,353
What?

2332
01:33:47,683 --> 01:33:48,723
I like this place.

2333
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:50,053
That's incredible.

2334
01:33:51,023 --> 01:33:53,483
- That's incredible. - Crater of Diamonds State Park.

2335
01:33:53,483 --> 01:33:54,923
You can keep the diamonds you find.

2336
01:33:54,923 --> 01:33:57,183
- That sounds great. - Do you really get to keep it?

2337
01:33:57,923 --> 01:34:00,823
That's why I recommend Crater of Diamonds State Park.

2338
01:34:08,123 --> 01:34:11,083
(People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent)

2339
01:34:11,653 --> 01:34:14,483
Not all recommendations by one percent...

2340
01:34:14,483 --> 01:34:16,123
- are terrible. - You are right.

2341
01:34:16,123 --> 01:34:17,423
There was one good one.

2342
01:34:17,423 --> 01:34:21,683
The biggest diamond that was found in Crater of Diamonds State Park...

2343
01:34:21,683 --> 01:34:23,253
was 16.3 carat.

2344
01:34:23,823 --> 01:34:25,653
A 7.44-carat diamond was found in March,

2345
01:34:25,653 --> 01:34:28,753
and a 2.65-carat diamond was found in May.

2346
01:34:29,123 --> 01:34:31,523
We will receive recommendations until the project ends...

2347
01:34:31,683 --> 01:34:34,753
and choose from a shortlist.

2348
01:34:35,323 --> 01:34:37,583
Who will go?

2349
01:34:37,583 --> 01:34:39,483
(Who will go to the fascinating place for 1 percent?)

2350
01:34:40,083 --> 01:34:42,923
(Who will go?)

2351
01:34:43,223 --> 01:34:45,283
The one who will go to Place for 1 Percent...

2352
01:34:45,723 --> 01:34:48,823
is the member with three I Go Stickers.

2353
01:34:48,823 --> 01:34:52,223
(The member with 3 I Go Stickers and another member)

2354
01:34:52,223 --> 01:34:55,123
They will also choose another member to go with.

2355
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:58,653
The die that is thrown by the winner of the race...

2356
01:34:58,653 --> 01:35:00,053
will decide who gets the Sticker.

2357
01:35:00,053 --> 01:35:02,683
It's going to be a little bit different this time around.

2358
01:35:02,683 --> 01:35:05,983
This time, the winner will get to choose your fates.

2359
01:35:05,983 --> 01:35:08,283
It's "I go" in English, so it means "I will go."

2360
01:35:08,283 --> 01:35:09,423
- "I go." - "I go."

2361
01:35:09,423 --> 01:35:11,253
(Poor me. I'm going.)

2362
01:35:11,253 --> 01:35:13,383
How is this Sticker different from the one what we had before?

2363
01:35:13,653 --> 01:35:14,823
Goodness.

2364
01:35:15,283 --> 01:35:16,423
My gosh.

2365
01:35:16,723 --> 01:35:18,023
Are you playing tricks with us?

2366
01:35:18,053 --> 01:35:19,183
Are you slacking off these days?

2367
01:35:19,783 --> 01:35:20,853
Do you even do meetings?

2368
01:35:20,853 --> 01:35:22,253
It's now called I Go Sticker?

2369
01:35:22,653 --> 01:35:25,053
After this special, you'll be going somewhere, is that it?

2370
01:35:25,583 --> 01:35:27,253
- This is crazy. - My gosh.

2371
01:35:27,383 --> 01:35:31,753
This time, however, only two people will be designated to go.

2372
01:35:32,423 --> 01:35:35,353
People's Recommendation Project, A Place for 1 Percent.

2373
01:35:35,353 --> 01:35:36,723
The first race is...

2374
01:35:36,723 --> 01:35:39,723
about finding the highest 1 percent. It's called "The 1st Place Tour".

2375
01:35:39,723 --> 01:35:41,983
(The 1st Place Tour)

2376
01:35:42,653 --> 01:35:46,153
(They head out to find everything that's ranked 1st in Japan.)

2377
01:35:46,153 --> 01:35:48,283
(The special guest, Jung Hye Sung)

2378
01:35:48,283 --> 01:35:50,853
(The best)

2379
01:35:50,853 --> 01:35:53,323
(The highest)

2380
01:35:53,323 --> 01:35:56,383
(The longest)

2381
01:35:56,383 --> 01:36:01,223
(The 1st Place Tour takes place in Japan.)

2382
01:36:01,223 --> 01:36:08,083
(They begin their new project to search for only the top best.)

2383
01:36:08,083 --> 01:36:10,553
(Which team will win this race?)

2384
01:36:10,623 --> 01:36:14,223
(The 1st Place Tour in Tokyo)
