1
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:08,125
(The grand finale, Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear)

2
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:11,325
(The extreme fear they have never experienced)

3
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:15,995
(The experience came to an end after many tears.)

4
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:18,925
(We are finally done with the penalty.)

5
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:25,495
(However, Global Project Part 2 began right away.)

6
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:27,695
(People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent)

7
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:34,695
(The one with 3 I Go Stickers must go with a chosen companion.)

8
00:00:35,865 --> 00:00:39,025
(The travel attraction is chosen by 1 percent of the viewers.)

9
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:42,695
(Running Man will go to a place for 1 percent.)

10
00:00:43,655 --> 00:00:49,155
(From the ossuaries to the cliffs, the decision is up to the viewers.)

11
00:00:49,155 --> 00:00:53,155
(Running Man will leave once again to a recommended travel attraction.)

12
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:57,125
(It will be exciting to have the members experience it for me.)

13
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,325
(Not a minute passed since the scary trip.)

14
00:00:59,655 --> 00:01:01,095
(Why are you doing this to us?)

15
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,325
(Among numerous destinations given by the viewers around the world, )

16
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:07,995
(they will go to the place that was recommended by 1 percent.)

17
00:01:07,995 --> 00:01:10,355
(If you don't want to go, avoid the I Go Sticker.)

18
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:14,925
(Part 1 will start now and decide the 8 members' fates.)

19
00:01:15,855 --> 00:01:18,725
People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent, Part 1.

20
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:21,855
The 1st race is a search for the best 1 percent,

21
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:23,155
The 1st Place Tour.

22
00:01:23,155 --> 00:01:25,055
(The 1st Place Tour?)

23
00:01:26,255 --> 00:01:29,855
(They must find the best in The 1st Place Tour in Tokyo.)

24
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:32,695
You will be divided into 3 teams for The 1st Place Tour.

25
00:01:32,995 --> 00:01:35,055
Before the end of the mission,

26
00:01:35,055 --> 00:01:37,395
a team must find the first place in various areas...

27
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:40,195
and receive the most number of stamps to win.

28
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:46,325
(The winners will be exempt from the I Go Sticker.)

29
00:01:46,325 --> 00:01:48,095
(An exemption from the I Go Sticker is not the only benefit.)

30
00:01:48,095 --> 00:01:49,325
The winners will decide...

31
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:53,025
who receives the I Go Sticker by rolling a die.

32
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:54,225
(It would be the best to win.)

33
00:01:54,925 --> 00:01:56,595
That means we won't be free tomorrow.

34
00:01:57,795 --> 00:01:59,695
What are you talking about? Did you think we would go home?

35
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:01,425
I thought we would leave after enjoying some free time.

36
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:02,755
You thought we would go sightseeing?

37
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:05,195
Since we struggled a lot, I thought they would buy us a meal.

38
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:08,125
- It's time to decide on the teams. - Yes.

39
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:10,925
The members who went to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear...

40
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:12,995
- brought back name tags, right? - Yes.

41
00:02:13,095 --> 00:02:16,125
If you take a look at it again, you will see colors.

42
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,255
There it is.

43
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:19,225
- You are right. - Mine is red.

44
00:02:19,225 --> 00:02:20,925
(On the name tags are glow sticks in three colors.)

45
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:26,025
Please stand with a member who has the same color.

46
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:27,325
(Team Green, Team Blue, Team Red)

47
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:28,595
Now,

48
00:02:28,595 --> 00:02:31,465
Jong Kook, Haha, and Ji Hyo of Team Happy Trip...

49
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:34,825
will each join a team.

50
00:02:35,995 --> 00:02:39,325
It looks like which team you join is important.

51
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,355
That's right. It will be your team for the new project.

52
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:44,055
(Haha chooses first since he used the least amount of money.)

53
00:02:45,225 --> 00:02:47,755
This is a very important decision.

54
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,195
In that case,

55
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:53,555
I will have to choose people who are very cunning.

56
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,325
That's So Min.

57
00:02:56,325 --> 00:02:58,455
(She is the queen of slyness.)

58
00:02:58,455 --> 00:02:59,455
I will join Jae Seok's team.

59
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:01,455
My goodness.

60
00:03:01,695 --> 00:03:03,425
Look, we must join forces...

61
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:05,125
for this mission.

62
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,355
My goodness.

63
00:03:06,355 --> 00:03:07,355
Next.

64
00:03:07,425 --> 00:03:09,525
I am next. I had made up my mind...

65
00:03:10,095 --> 00:03:12,125
- from the start. - Really?

66
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,625
- Really? - Which team will you join?

67
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,495
I choose Se Chan.

68
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,125
Okay!

69
00:03:17,195 --> 00:03:19,355
(I choose Se Chan.)

70
00:03:19,355 --> 00:03:21,195
She chose Se Chan, not Seok Jin.

71
00:03:21,195 --> 00:03:22,855
- Seriously. - Se Chan.

72
00:03:22,855 --> 00:03:24,595
- Se Chan. - It's okay. We are still a team.

73
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:26,525
I chose Se Chan, not you.

74
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:28,155
- Why not? - That means...

75
00:03:28,155 --> 00:03:29,325
Jong Kook...

76
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:31,625
(Jong Kook is scarier than Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

77
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,755
You shouldn't use this as a weapon.

78
00:03:34,855 --> 00:03:37,425
- Come on. - I didn't do anything wrong.

79
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,225
- Hey. - What?

80
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:40,895
Are we in the same team again?

81
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:42,525
Aren't you happy?

82
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:44,625
I am happy.

83
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,095
There are only two of us.

84
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:49,255
- That team has 2 members. - There are only 2 of us.

85
00:03:49,255 --> 00:03:51,625
One team is short of a member.

86
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,825
That's why we invited a special guest.

87
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:55,155
- Is there a guest? - Really?

88
00:03:55,155 --> 00:03:56,525
Is someone here?

89
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:58,755
We invited the queen for one percent.

90
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,725
(The queen?)

91
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:03,595
- Did a guest come at this hour? - Right now?

92
00:04:03,595 --> 00:04:04,595
- Really? - Right now?

93
00:04:04,595 --> 00:04:06,125
Who came at this late hour?

94
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:09,095
I present the queen for one percent. Please come on out.

95
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:10,855
(Who traveled the long distance to join them?)

96
00:04:10,855 --> 00:04:12,055
- My goodness. - My goodness.

97
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:14,095
- My goodness. - Hello.

98
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:15,895
- It's Hye Sung. - Hello.

99
00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:16,895
What brought you here?

100
00:04:16,895 --> 00:04:18,125
(The master of cute acts, Actress Jung Hye Sung)

101
00:04:18,595 --> 00:04:21,895
(She is the rising star of 2017 everyone is focusing on.)

102
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,855
(The 1st place guest with charms and acting skills, Jung Hye Sung)

103
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:26,855
Hello, I am Jung Hye Sung.

104
00:04:26,855 --> 00:04:28,355
(Fresh)

105
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,055
My goodness.

106
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:33,895
(Did you see the way she smiled at me?)

107
00:04:36,325 --> 00:04:38,055
Is Kwang Soo possessed?

108
00:04:38,055 --> 00:04:39,455
(Scared)

109
00:04:39,455 --> 00:04:42,555
I think he is possessed. Kwang Soo.

110
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,795
Kwang Soo, get a hold of yourself.

111
00:04:45,855 --> 00:04:47,425
Will Hye Sung join our team?

112
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:49,055
- Yes. - Really?

113
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:51,395
It's a blessing.

114
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,725
I sweated a lot.

115
00:04:52,895 --> 00:04:53,895
Hye Sung.

116
00:04:54,325 --> 00:04:56,355
You must have waited for a long time.

117
00:04:56,355 --> 00:04:59,695
(They say that sweaty men are sexy.)

118
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,155
What is wrong with your hair?

119
00:05:02,495 --> 00:05:03,955
- It's okay. - Did you take a shower?

120
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:05,095
Why are you acting cool?

121
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:06,655
He acts like he just came out of the shower.

122
00:05:06,725 --> 00:05:08,125
Why are you acting cool?

123
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,655
That's sweat.

124
00:05:09,855 --> 00:05:12,495
He sweated a lot since he was scared.

125
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:15,855
(Only walk on the flowery path, Hye Sung.)

126
00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:18,695
You look like a loser.

127
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:19,995
(Kwang Soo, you are doing it wrong.)

128
00:05:19,995 --> 00:05:22,025
How do I look?

129
00:05:22,025 --> 00:05:23,025
(The way he shows his charms is a bit off.)

130
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:24,265
Why? How do I look?

131
00:05:24,265 --> 00:05:27,095
- Kwang Soo. - You look cool.

132
00:05:27,095 --> 00:05:29,725
You look like a musician.

133
00:05:29,855 --> 00:05:31,155
Hello.

134
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:33,695
Go and get a haircut right away.

135
00:05:33,695 --> 00:05:34,695
For goodness' sake.

136
00:05:34,855 --> 00:05:38,725
The three teams will now move to their accommodations.

137
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:40,555
There are tree types of accommodations.

138
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:43,095
The first one is a luxury hotel in the city center.

139
00:05:43,555 --> 00:05:45,025
(It's a luxury hotel.)

140
00:05:45,455 --> 00:05:47,455
The second one is a traditional ryokan.

141
00:05:48,095 --> 00:05:50,495
(The high-end ryokan)

142
00:05:50,825 --> 00:05:53,425
The third one are tents at Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.

143
00:05:53,425 --> 00:05:54,495
What?

144
00:05:57,425 --> 00:06:00,955
(The tents are set up at the gate of Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

145
00:06:00,955 --> 00:06:04,425
You should let us sleep in peace.

146
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:06,195
Tents at Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear?

147
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:08,555
That means some of us will end up sleeping here.

148
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:12,255
The teams will now move to their accommodations.

149
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:14,925
- We don't know where to go. - You already chose where to sleep.

150
00:06:14,925 --> 00:06:15,925
When did we do that?

151
00:06:16,855 --> 00:06:17,925
How did we do that?

152
00:06:17,925 --> 00:06:18,955
(Did we choose the accommodation?)

153
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,955
There were three colors per name tag.

154
00:06:21,955 --> 00:06:24,625
You chose a name tag of a certain color.

155
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:26,355
Taking off the name tag will reveal...

156
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:28,195
where you will sleep tonight.

157
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:29,195
No way.

158
00:06:29,195 --> 00:06:30,755
(In order to start the tour full of energy, )

159
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:33,955
(they must avoid staying at the Labyrinth for the night.)

160
00:06:33,955 --> 00:06:37,395
(Who will spend the night in the tent in front of the Labyrinth?)

161
00:06:38,595 --> 00:06:39,955
- We got ryokan! - It's ryokan.

162
00:06:39,955 --> 00:06:41,825
- I'm relieved. - We got ryokan.

163
00:06:41,855 --> 00:06:43,125
What about us? What did we get?

164
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:46,695
(It's Team Hye Sung's turn, but Kwang Soo is in her team.)

165
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:49,755
(Ever since arriving in Japan, his misfortune has heightened.)

166
00:06:50,055 --> 00:06:52,695
(The start of his misfortune was small as he got 10 slots.)

167
00:06:52,695 --> 00:06:55,095
(However, he ended up having 20 slots at the end.)

168
00:06:56,325 --> 00:06:59,855
(With this momentum, he advanced to the Labyrinth by himself.)

169
00:06:59,855 --> 00:07:03,625
(Luck seems to run away from him. Where will his lodging be?)

170
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,725
What did we get?

171
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:09,455
- We got luxury hotel! - Luxury hotel!

172
00:07:09,455 --> 00:07:10,795
(Has his curse been lifted?)

173
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:12,495
- What? - I wasn't expecting this.

174
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,095
(That means Team Ji Hyo has...)

175
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:17,125
Darn it!

176
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:20,225
(For them, the experience at the Labyrinth isn't over.)

177
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:21,995
I wasn't expecting this.

178
00:07:21,995 --> 00:07:23,625
This isn't bad at all.

179
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:26,425
(Yes! We are saved!)

180
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:27,925
Are we going to sleep here?

181
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:29,925
You will pitch a tent and sleep in front of the Labyrinth.

182
00:07:29,925 --> 00:07:30,955
- Really? - That's harsh.

183
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:32,825
(It's nice. I'll get to see the ghosts again.)

184
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:34,055
Gosh, how will you manage?

185
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:35,555
They will be cold during the night.

186
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,855
- Go and sleep in your lodgings now. - We can go now?

187
00:07:38,855 --> 00:07:40,025
- We'll go now. - See you tomorrow, Se Chan.

188
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:41,755
- Good work, everyone. - I'm sorry.

189
00:07:41,755 --> 00:07:43,455
- We are going now. - Goodnight.

190
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:44,955
- Take care. - We'll see you tomorrow.

191
00:07:44,955 --> 00:07:46,255
- See you tomorrow. - See you.

192
00:07:46,595 --> 00:07:48,125
- Hye Sung, see you tomorrow. - All right.

193
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,525
- Good job today. - I'm about to lose it.

194
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:50,825
(Which team will experience the most 1st places?)

195
00:07:50,825 --> 00:07:51,955
Let's go, Jong Kook.

196
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:53,695
(Team Hye Sung heads to a hotel in the city.)

197
00:07:53,695 --> 00:07:55,455
- What is this? - Let's go. I got this for you.

198
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,295
- I bought this for you. - Of course he did.

199
00:07:57,295 --> 00:07:58,425
- Really? - Yes.

200
00:07:58,655 --> 00:08:02,555
- I saw you buying this. - This is quite expensive.

201
00:08:02,555 --> 00:08:05,095
(He manages to be in her good graces with the wallet.)

202
00:08:05,095 --> 00:08:06,095
- This is Totoro. - Right.

203
00:08:06,095 --> 00:08:07,395
Goodness.

204
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:09,795
- Please stand in the center. - Yes, stand in the middle.

205
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:10,855
- Thank you. - Gosh.

206
00:08:10,855 --> 00:08:13,495
(I have a good feeling about this. This might turn into something.)

207
00:08:14,095 --> 00:08:16,455
When I go into a haunted house like this one,

208
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:19,495
I can't control myself but curse right away.

209
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:20,825
Oh, you curse.

210
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,925
- You do curse. - She's not so different from us.

211
00:08:22,925 --> 00:08:24,255
I can understand though.

212
00:08:24,495 --> 00:08:26,025
What are we doing tomorrow?

213
00:08:26,425 --> 00:08:28,455
- I heard we have a mission. - Jong Kook.

214
00:08:28,995 --> 00:08:30,395
We don't know anything about that.

215
00:08:30,395 --> 00:08:32,055
(Why do you have a bug on you?)

216
00:08:32,055 --> 00:08:33,195
- Was that a bug? - Yes.

217
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,395
(Startled)

218
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,395
- Why were you surprised? - He startled me.

219
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:41,495
- Why were you startled? - He scared me.

220
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:43,825
(The cameraman startled Kwang Soo.)

221
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:45,295
- Hye Sung, go before me. - Kwang Soo.

222
00:08:45,295 --> 00:08:46,725
No, I am fine. Please go without me.

223
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:47,895
- Please go. - Kwang Soo.

224
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:50,095
- That was really uncool of you. - Hold on.

225
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:51,225
You were so lame.

226
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:52,955
- Gosh, Hye Sung. Please go. - Kwang Soo.

227
00:08:52,955 --> 00:08:54,255
- Let me just stay here for a while. - Kwang Soo.

228
00:08:54,255 --> 00:08:56,225
Please go without me. I said go!

229
00:08:56,525 --> 00:08:57,625
Go now!

230
00:08:58,295 --> 00:09:00,455
- Why are you sitting down? - Go! Wait for me in the car.

231
00:09:00,455 --> 00:09:01,525
- Why did you sit down? - You're sitting alone.

232
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:03,055
- Why are you sitting down? - What?

233
00:09:03,055 --> 00:09:04,055
To give this to Hye Sung.

234
00:09:04,055 --> 00:09:07,125
(I wanted to give this to Hye Sung.)

235
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,825
I knelt down to give this to you.

236
00:09:08,825 --> 00:09:10,655
(I fooled you, didn't I? I like surprises.)

237
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,925
This was all for her, right?

238
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:14,895
- What am I doing? - I was startled too.

239
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:16,255
Hye Sung, I'm sorry about him.

240
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,755
(She accepts Kwang Soo's gift.)

241
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,655
(I am such a cool guy.)

242
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:22,755
- By the way, - We'll get going now.

243
00:09:22,755 --> 00:09:25,595
I am relieved we aren't spending the night at the Labyrinth.

244
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:27,695
- I am really relieved too. - That's right.

245
00:09:27,895 --> 00:09:29,595
Had we gotten the Labyrinth, I would have cried.

246
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:31,025
Seok Jin...

247
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:34,295
He was really angry.

248
00:09:34,295 --> 00:09:35,495
He really was.

249
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:38,125
I can't understand this.

250
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:40,655
- I'm sorry. - I know.

251
00:09:40,655 --> 00:09:42,695
When I saw it... Goodness.

252
00:09:42,955 --> 00:09:44,925
I was so sorry when I saw the tent.

253
00:09:46,055 --> 00:09:48,495
- Seok Jin and Se Chan, tomorrow, - Yes?

254
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:51,025
- let's show them what we've got. - I agree. Let's do that.

255
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:53,125
- I'm ready to do anything. - Let's do this.

256
00:09:53,695 --> 00:09:56,125
- Let's head to our cozy tents. - Let's go.

257
00:09:56,455 --> 00:09:57,655
I guess they're all set up.

258
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:00,425
This is driving me crazy.

259
00:10:00,995 --> 00:10:01,995
- I'm about to lose it. - I see the weeds.

260
00:10:01,995 --> 00:10:03,895
Come on. What is this?

261
00:10:04,795 --> 00:10:06,655
(Their home is located in front of the Labyrinth.)

262
00:10:06,655 --> 00:10:08,195
How are we supposed to sleep here?

263
00:10:09,055 --> 00:10:11,755
The left tent is Ji Hyo's.

264
00:10:11,955 --> 00:10:15,055
The tent on the right is for Seok Jin and Se Chan.

265
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:17,395
This is insane.

266
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:19,795
(Even the ghosts wouldn't want to spend the night in the cold tents.)

267
00:10:20,895 --> 00:10:22,255
How can we sleep here?

268
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,955
Give us the heating packs, and put the lights on the tents.

269
00:10:25,955 --> 00:10:27,595
Is this how you treat your stars?

270
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:31,125
(Yes, this is how the stars are treated on Running Man.)

271
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,795
(Going in)

272
00:10:32,795 --> 00:10:35,225
(What's worse is that it's uncomfortable and cramped.)

273
00:10:35,825 --> 00:10:37,125
There's a sleeping bag for us.

274
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,655
We can sleep in the sleeping bags.

275
00:10:40,455 --> 00:10:42,255
- Goodnight. - Goodnight, Seok Jin.

276
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:45,395
- Seok Jin, let's win tomorrow. - Let's win.

277
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,125
I think I really saw a ghost in there.

278
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,895
(Can Team Ji Hyo take the 1st place tomorrow?)

279
00:10:49,755 --> 00:10:51,125
- Hello. - Hi.

280
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,425
(Kwang Soo manages to sit next to Hye Sung.)

281
00:10:52,425 --> 00:10:55,055
- Do you want some chocolates? - What should we do?

282
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,355
Gosh, you are an angel.

283
00:10:58,455 --> 00:11:01,125
- Thank you. Goodness. - Thank you.

284
00:11:01,455 --> 00:11:02,925
Taste the chocolate awarded by the angel.

285
00:11:03,755 --> 00:11:05,655
(Hye Sung laughs at something.)

286
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:07,295
Kwang Soo, you look so cute in this photo.

287
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,825
(What is the photo she saw?)

288
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:13,795
(Is he cute? The crew of Running Man respects your preferences.)

289
00:11:14,055 --> 00:11:15,455
Kwang Soo, you look so cute in this photo.

290
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:17,125
(His heart pounds.)

291
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:19,395
- Look, he looks cute. - You really are an angel.

292
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:20,795
What an angel.

293
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:23,825
Hye Sung, I'll talk casually to you now.

294
00:11:23,825 --> 00:11:25,695
Please do.

295
00:11:25,955 --> 00:11:27,955
- You don't have a boyfriend, right? - No.

296
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:30,625
- "We Got Married" ended recently. - That's right.

297
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,425
We happen to be single too.

298
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:35,395
(Is that so?)

299
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:37,625
- You are really single? - I don't mean anything by this.

300
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,725
Kwang Soo is...

301
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,755
- You are single too? - Yes.

302
00:11:41,395 --> 00:11:43,125
- We don't have any. - We really don't.

303
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,355
- Why? - How are you single?

304
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:46,825
What? Why?

305
00:11:47,425 --> 00:11:49,295
- I am really single. - I don't get it. How is that?

306
00:11:49,295 --> 00:11:50,455
Why didn't you ask me that?

307
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:51,725
(Is it natural that I'm single?)

308
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:53,925
- I said I was single like he is. - I know that you are popular.

309
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:55,525
- That's right. He's popular. - I was...

310
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:57,095
Do you like Jong Kook?

311
00:11:57,255 --> 00:11:59,755
- What's up with you? Stop it. - It's just that...

312
00:11:59,925 --> 00:12:01,055
- Let's be honest. - That's not what I meant.

313
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:02,295
- It's not that. - In Russia...

314
00:12:02,325 --> 00:12:03,395
(He chokes up.)

315
00:12:03,425 --> 00:12:04,755
Something similar happened.

316
00:12:05,995 --> 00:12:10,595
(His romance with Dasha began as everyone rooted for their love.)

317
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:13,455
(A long-distance relationship won't be that bad.)

318
00:12:14,095 --> 00:12:17,025
(But as time passed by, )

319
00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:20,655
(Jong Kook overcame the language barrier all by himself.)

320
00:12:20,655 --> 00:12:23,625
(What was the name of the English academy Jae Seok promotes?)

321
00:12:23,895 --> 00:12:26,195
(While Jong Kook and Dasha were getting along well, )

322
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:30,125
(Kwang Soo was completely forgotten.)

323
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,395
What do I do?

324
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:33,195
No one is paying attention to me!

325
00:12:33,195 --> 00:12:36,395
(He was traumatized when Jong Kook stole his thunder.)

326
00:12:36,855 --> 00:12:38,925
In Russia, I had a bad experience.

327
00:12:39,895 --> 00:12:43,325
Guys like you are my type.

328
00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:44,825
(It's going to happen today!)

329
00:12:44,825 --> 00:12:45,955
Don't be insecure.

330
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:49,025
It's true.

331
00:12:50,055 --> 00:12:51,525
I like tall, slim men.

332
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:52,925
(This is Hye Sung's ideal type.)

333
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,225
(Kwang is very slim and tall.)

334
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:56,995
I feel like I have to protect you.

335
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:59,725
I can be the one leading.

336
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:01,825
Don't fall for me too hard though.

337
00:13:01,825 --> 00:13:03,855
(Don't fall for me too hard though.)

338
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:04,925
Let's take things slowly.

339
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:07,695
Kwang Soo always falls in love.

340
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,755
I just fall in love, but I don't have a girlfriend.

341
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,055
It's one-sided love.

342
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:13,125
Even at this very moment, I am in love.

343
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,755
I can't tell you who it is.

344
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:17,525
(Hye Sung plays along.)

345
00:13:17,525 --> 00:13:20,955
On the way to the hotel, we should get to know you more...

346
00:13:20,955 --> 00:13:22,125
and what kind of a person you are.

347
00:13:22,455 --> 00:13:24,125
I am very shy.

348
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,855
- You are? - I'm being shy now too.

349
00:13:26,255 --> 00:13:28,655
- Oh, really? - When I feel comfortable...

350
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:30,725
When I start to feel comfortable,

351
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:32,995
I have mood swings.

352
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:34,055
- Really? - Mood swings?

353
00:13:34,825 --> 00:13:37,095
When I am excited, I get really hyper.

354
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:38,595
When I am tired,

355
00:13:38,955 --> 00:13:40,495
I get like this.

356
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:43,795
(Flustered)

357
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:45,195
What's wrong, Kwang Soo?

358
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:46,395
(I thought we could be soulmates.)

359
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:47,925
- Why? - This is unexpected.

360
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,625
I didn't know Hye Sung had mood swings.

361
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,825
(Will Hye Sung and Kwang Soo be able to get close?)

362
00:13:53,025 --> 00:13:54,125
- Take this too. - Thank you.

363
00:13:54,455 --> 00:13:55,525
Great work.

364
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:57,125
- Thank you for your service. - Thank you.

365
00:13:57,255 --> 00:13:58,455
Gosh, this ryokan is...

366
00:13:59,395 --> 00:14:01,995
- This ryokan looks really nice. - It looks great.

367
00:14:01,995 --> 00:14:04,095
This isn't what I had in mind.

368
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:07,695
(Ryokan is a type of traditional Japanese inn from the Edo period.)

369
00:14:07,695 --> 00:14:11,325
(It consists of a Japanese garden and tatami, Japanese mat.)

370
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:14,555
I didn't expect we'd stay at a nice ryokan like this.

371
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,595
I was so surprised when I arrived here.

372
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:22,295
("Walk to the Ryokan with Reporter Jeon So Min")

373
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:24,225
That's right. Ryokans...

374
00:14:25,055 --> 00:14:27,095
don't have beds. Look.

375
00:14:27,095 --> 00:14:31,525
(It is furnished with tatamis and blankets instead of beds.)

376
00:14:34,225 --> 00:14:36,725
Where is the room for Jae Seok and Haha?

377
00:14:36,725 --> 00:14:37,725
(Jeon So Min, actress from Neunggok)

378
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,655
This is their room.

379
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:42,825
Can I come in?

380
00:14:43,255 --> 00:14:45,225
Gosh, look. There's the hot tub.

381
00:14:46,295 --> 00:14:47,455
Is that the hot tub?

382
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:49,395
(This is a tub filled with hot spring water.)

383
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:51,095
(Mesmerized)

384
00:14:51,095 --> 00:14:52,355
That must be so warm.

385
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:53,955
(Hot spring water is pouring out.)

386
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:57,255
Should I dip my feet?

387
00:14:57,825 --> 00:14:59,655
(I'm sorry to say this, but this is Jae Seok and Haha's room.)

388
00:14:59,655 --> 00:15:00,995
- So Min. - Yes?

389
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,325
Jae Seok is taking a shower right next to that tub.

390
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:07,855
(She's flustered.)

391
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:09,995
He's in a bind now.

392
00:15:09,995 --> 00:15:11,595
I should get going now.

393
00:15:11,695 --> 00:15:13,095
Jae Seok is taking a shower.

394
00:15:13,895 --> 00:15:15,655
I should go and take a bath too.

395
00:15:15,655 --> 00:15:17,125
(Members at the ryokan end their night on a good note.)

396
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,795
(A team is in desperate need of a hot bath.)

397
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:21,125
Ji Hyo, you picked us, but I am sorry this happened.

398
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,255
No, don't be. Let's win tomorrow.

399
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,125
- We'll definitely win. Don't worry. - Let's do that.

400
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,925
- I mean this. - Okay.

401
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:30,355
We will see you tomorrow morning.

402
00:15:30,355 --> 00:15:31,395
Goodnight.

403
00:15:31,395 --> 00:15:33,395
(Goodnight as you dream of turning the tables.)

404
00:15:35,825 --> 00:15:39,495
(The morning of the 1st Place Tour in Tokyo has come.)

405
00:15:39,495 --> 00:15:42,855
(Strategies are important. What is Team So Min's strategy?)

406
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:44,255
- Good morning. - Morning.

407
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:47,055
After your breakfast,

408
00:15:47,055 --> 00:15:49,595
you can start your mission.

409
00:15:49,655 --> 00:15:51,795
As I have told you last night, today's project is...

410
00:15:51,795 --> 00:15:54,555
part 1 of People's Recommendation Project, A Place for 1 Percent.

411
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:57,325
You must find places that boast to be the best.

412
00:15:57,725 --> 00:15:59,625
Right now, what on earth...

413
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,125
What was yesterday's project?

414
00:16:01,655 --> 00:16:03,125
I can't keep up with the projects at all.

415
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,855
We're done with Tour Stickers, and now, we have I Go Stickers.

416
00:16:04,855 --> 00:16:06,925
- We will get those stickers now. - It's like a new season.

417
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,895
- We are done with Tour Stickers? - Yes.

418
00:16:08,895 --> 00:16:10,295
You have new stickers called I Go Stickers.

419
00:16:10,295 --> 00:16:11,455
Goodness.

420
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:13,095
This is really challenging.

421
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,625
Because you are...

422
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:18,025
wearing that outfit, you look like a frog even more.

423
00:16:18,195 --> 00:16:19,325
(She looks exactly like a frog.)

424
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:20,355
Your eyes...

425
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:22,055
- Aren't they swollen? - Yes.

426
00:16:22,055 --> 00:16:24,595
I had the cup noodles Haha gave me last night.

427
00:16:24,595 --> 00:16:25,825
- You ate that last night? - Yes.

428
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:28,695
I saw you eat gimbap by yourself last night too.

429
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:31,055
We were all tired and knocked out,

430
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,095
but she was eating gimbap at a convenience store.

431
00:16:33,095 --> 00:16:35,595
I ate it with a soft-boiled egg.

432
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:36,825
It was fine until I finished them.

433
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:38,995
I came back, washed up, and was putting lotion on.

434
00:16:38,995 --> 00:16:40,955
- That's when I felt something. - That happens sometimes.

435
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:44,095
Everything seemed so scary all of a sudden.

436
00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:47,855
The wardrobe, the blanket chest, and behind the curtain...

437
00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:49,825
Even in my room... You don't have it in your room.

438
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:52,895
You know the Japanese dressing table with a folding mirror...

439
00:16:52,895 --> 00:16:54,055
It's in my room.

440
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:57,625
I suddenly felt they were watching me. I was alone in the room too.

441
00:16:57,955 --> 00:16:59,825
- I really... - I was just sound asleep.

442
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:01,755
Missed Ji Hyo last night.

443
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:04,125
- What? - I missed her very much.

444
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,955
Even that video call...

445
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:08,255
Even...

446
00:17:08,255 --> 00:17:11,625
- that video call... - I'm sorry, but I've had enough.

447
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,425
(When will you stop talking? I'm losing my patience.)

448
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:15,325
So Min, stop talking now.

449
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:19,725
We didn't even say a word and listened to what you had to say.

450
00:17:19,895 --> 00:17:22,125
This room is much brighter. My room is way...

451
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,995
- The mood is... - It's because of the lights.

452
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:27,095
Is that so?

453
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:28,955
(Dazzling)

454
00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:29,955
Is that so?

455
00:17:30,255 --> 00:17:31,825
So Min...

456
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:34,495
You need to come to your senses. You see the lights are on.

457
00:17:34,495 --> 00:17:36,065
- From the morning... - We kept silent...

458
00:17:36,065 --> 00:17:38,125
not because we didn't know how to talk.

459
00:17:39,495 --> 00:17:41,095
- Them too. - Why then?

460
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:42,625
I can't stand seeing them either.

461
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,095
Those cameramen.

462
00:17:44,325 --> 00:17:45,625
They're so annoying.

463
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:47,625
They made it scarier by screaming so hard.

464
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,325
(Kwon Ryeol screamed to death which made Jae Seok more scared.)

465
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,355
(He wanted to avoid ghosts, )

466
00:17:51,355 --> 00:17:54,755
(but he kept on filming. He's indeed a professional cameraman.)

467
00:17:54,755 --> 00:17:57,025
How could he film like this?

468
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:58,125
(He's now an expert in filming horror stuff too.)

469
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,195
Goodness.

470
00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:01,695
He was so annoying back in Mongolia too.

471
00:18:01,755 --> 00:18:03,995
You, Kwon Ryeol.

472
00:18:04,225 --> 00:18:07,455
We were at our lodging, and he was installing a camera in my room.

473
00:18:07,695 --> 00:18:09,565
I asked whether it captured this side as well.

474
00:18:09,565 --> 00:18:11,065
He said it didn't since he adjusted its angle.

475
00:18:11,065 --> 00:18:12,855
I later watched the show and it captured the entire room.

476
00:18:13,065 --> 00:18:16,725
(It's the angle Jae Seok expected to be captured.)

477
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:19,295
(It's how Kwon Ryeol adjusted its angle.)

478
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:21,525
(Jae Seok's privacy was then captured in the camera.)

479
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:25,325
Seok Jin and I walked around the room without any clothes on.

480
00:18:26,225 --> 00:18:27,655
- It got aired? - Me too.

481
00:18:27,655 --> 00:18:28,925
It happened to me too.

482
00:18:29,565 --> 00:18:31,195
I thought it didn't capture my entire room,

483
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:33,295
- but apparently, it did. - Right?

484
00:18:33,955 --> 00:18:36,755
It didn't. It's not the case for you. I'm serious.

485
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:38,825
- Really? - Don't make up stories to talk.

486
00:18:39,065 --> 00:18:41,755
(Don't make up stories and butt in the conversation.)

487
00:18:41,755 --> 00:18:42,825
You come over here.

488
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,355
(Is it your mission to talk a lot today?)

489
00:18:45,355 --> 00:18:48,125
My face is swollen, isn't it?

490
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,955
Why would you change the subject again?

491
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:54,095
This is making me tired already.

492
00:18:55,455 --> 00:18:57,625
(Japanese breakfast is served for the three who're tired of talking.)

493
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:58,995
- Thank you. - Good morning.

494
00:18:58,995 --> 00:19:00,225
Hello.

495
00:19:00,225 --> 00:19:01,655
We're grilling meat?

496
00:19:01,755 --> 00:19:03,525
Are we having meat from the morning?

497
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:06,825
(Kaiseki is a Japanese course meal where various dishes are served...)

498
00:19:06,825 --> 00:19:08,655
(in small amounts in order.)

499
00:19:09,095 --> 00:19:11,065
(It contains the traditional Japanese taste and cooking skills.)

500
00:19:11,065 --> 00:19:13,125
- This must be sushi. - Goodness.

501
00:19:13,495 --> 00:19:15,495
(It looks delicious.)

502
00:19:15,495 --> 00:19:16,955
It's butter.

503
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:17,995
(She puts butter on the plate.)

504
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,855
(They grill beef on the hot stone plate.)

505
00:19:19,855 --> 00:19:21,725
- Gosh, the sound. - The grilling sound.

506
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:25,495
It's still in the morning. I need to buy this for home.

507
00:19:25,495 --> 00:19:26,695
I love it.

508
00:19:29,325 --> 00:19:30,755
It melts in my mouth.

509
00:19:31,995 --> 00:19:33,125
(They enjoy the luxury thanks to their choice.)

510
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,395
Gosh, I've never...

511
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:36,995
had this kind of breakfast before.

512
00:19:36,995 --> 00:19:38,525
- It's like we're playing house. - Really.

513
00:19:39,455 --> 00:19:40,825
It's a bowl of rice.

514
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:42,095
(Careful)

515
00:19:42,095 --> 00:19:44,655
(He should've asked a question, but messed the sentence up.)

516
00:19:44,655 --> 00:19:47,895
- What did you just say? - It's frustrating.

517
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,295
(He better speak in Korean if he's going to be terrible at it.)

518
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,125
(Here)

519
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,725
- Thank you. - I'm Korean, So Min.

520
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:55,755
(Thanking in Japanese)

521
00:19:55,755 --> 00:19:57,995
(Jae Seok's flustered.)

522
00:19:57,995 --> 00:19:59,425
- That was funny. - Why would she...

523
00:19:59,425 --> 00:20:00,895
"Thank you... What?"

524
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,195
Goodness, So Min.

525
00:20:03,295 --> 00:20:05,495
Why would you thank me in Japanese?

526
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:09,495
Come to think of it, my top is wasabi colored.

527
00:20:09,495 --> 00:20:10,925
(She's wearing a wasabi-colored top.)

528
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:13,855
Gosh, it's delicious.

529
00:20:13,855 --> 00:20:15,125
(He pretends as if he didn't hear it.)

530
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:17,295
- Why do you ignore her? - What?

531
00:20:17,295 --> 00:20:18,895
(Can't hear anything.)

532
00:20:19,095 --> 00:20:20,725
She just said she's wearing a wasabi-colored top.

533
00:20:20,725 --> 00:20:22,695
I was talking to myself.

534
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:27,065
- It's delicious. I'm serious. - It's great.

535
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,825
I'm not just saying. It's really good.

536
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:33,755
I searched online last night.

537
00:20:34,495 --> 00:20:36,225
- There's something. - Tell me about it.

538
00:20:36,225 --> 00:20:38,425
In Tokyo, there's a restaurant...

539
00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:41,095
which first came up with pork cutlet.

540
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:42,895
- What? - Really?

541
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:44,225
There's a place pork cutlets first originated from?

542
00:20:44,225 --> 00:20:45,525
(Even Koreans love pork cutlet.)

543
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:48,655
(This pork cutlet restaurant opened its business in 1895.)

544
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:53,325
(They maintained its original taste for over 100 years.)

545
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:57,455
(It's popular among both Japanese and tourists even until now.)

546
00:20:57,655 --> 00:21:00,395
I searched online in the morning as well.

547
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:04,065
This person runs 100m on 4 legs.

548
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,495
I've seen him on TV before.

549
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:06,795
- On four legs? - Does he live near here?

550
00:21:06,795 --> 00:21:09,455
On four legs. Yes. He's set a Guinness record.

551
00:21:09,455 --> 00:21:11,625
It says he can run 100m in 15 seconds on 4 legs.

552
00:21:12,495 --> 00:21:15,355
(Ito Kenichi is the living legend of running on four legs.)

553
00:21:16,795 --> 00:21:20,095
(He set a world's fastest record of running 100m in 15.71 seconds.)

554
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,995
He's really running on four legs.

555
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:27,325
Then does he wear shoes on his hands too?

556
00:21:27,655 --> 00:21:28,995
- Gloves. - He wears gloves.

557
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,025
Well, he runs on four legs, so I was curious.

558
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,655
(Why does today's morning seem so long?)

559
00:21:38,655 --> 00:21:41,525
We have a translator with us, so we can try contacting him if you want.

560
00:21:41,525 --> 00:21:42,565
Really?

561
00:21:42,565 --> 00:21:45,325
If you could do that for us...

562
00:21:47,355 --> 00:21:51,255
(While the staff is trying to contact Ito Kenichi, )

563
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:54,355
(the three come to experience a hot spring in ryokan.)

564
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,395
Is it awesome?

565
00:21:56,255 --> 00:21:57,355
So Min.

566
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,395
It's so warm and nice.

567
00:21:59,395 --> 00:22:01,625
Gosh, it's hot!

568
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,525
(It's hot!)

569
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,195
- It's hot? - Yes, it is.

570
00:22:05,195 --> 00:22:07,255
- It looks like a waterpark though. - Wow, here...

571
00:22:07,555 --> 00:22:09,995
This must be why people love going to hot springs.

572
00:22:10,355 --> 00:22:11,555
(Haha enjoys with a broom on his head.)

573
00:22:11,555 --> 00:22:12,625
It's nice.

574
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:16,195
Jae Seok, how many stamps do we need to get?

575
00:22:16,195 --> 00:22:19,525
You can get as many until you arrive at the airport at 4pm.

576
00:22:19,525 --> 00:22:20,595
(They have time until 4pm.)

577
00:22:20,595 --> 00:22:22,595
Then after we have pork cutlet,

578
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,795
I'll move around for stamps alone.

579
00:22:25,355 --> 00:22:26,425
Well...

580
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:28,225
I have...

581
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:30,595
(He's the king of online searching.)

582
00:22:30,655 --> 00:22:32,555
I have some places in mind already.

583
00:22:32,555 --> 00:22:34,325
(She becomes curious all of a sudden.)

584
00:22:34,325 --> 00:22:36,325
Haha, let me join you.

585
00:22:36,325 --> 00:22:38,755
Go away.

586
00:22:38,755 --> 00:22:42,425
Even her coming towards me is so scary.

587
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:47,755
(I want to join you and get a stamp too.)

588
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:49,125
Stop it.

589
00:22:49,255 --> 00:22:51,625
See how I'm not saying anything. I don't even ask where she's going.

590
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,395
She's not being scary. Let me clear things out.

591
00:22:55,555 --> 00:22:57,555
She's being very annoying.

592
00:22:57,555 --> 00:23:00,255
(She annoys people.)

593
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:03,255
I'm serious. She annoys people.

594
00:23:03,355 --> 00:23:05,055
I'll go with Haha.

595
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:08,995
He walks around on four legs like this.

596
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:11,625
That's very different.

597
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:17,055
Stop moving around like that.

598
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:19,725
She's stressing me out.

599
00:23:19,725 --> 00:23:21,325
(The two are exhausted by her chirping.)

600
00:23:21,325 --> 00:23:23,355
(How will their fate turn out?)

601
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,125
I'm still tired even though I had some sleep.

602
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:27,225
It's ill-fated around this place.

603
00:23:27,225 --> 00:23:29,955
We're still in front of the Labyrinth. Let's leave this place.

604
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:34,325
Anyway, we have to go look for whatever is in the 1st place, right?

605
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:36,125
Other than the amusement park ride, is there anything else?

606
00:23:36,655 --> 00:23:38,025
- You need to search yourself. - Search yourself.

607
00:23:38,025 --> 00:23:39,355
- Really? - Yes.

608
00:23:39,655 --> 00:23:41,725
Then... What do you do for the program exactly?

609
00:23:41,725 --> 00:23:43,655
(He wonders what the staff does for the show.)

610
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,555
What are you waiting for? Use your cellphones already.

611
00:23:45,795 --> 00:23:47,255
You'll have nothing to do then.

612
00:23:47,255 --> 00:23:49,255
- Search online now. - Hurry.

613
00:23:49,255 --> 00:23:51,755
- You shouldn't be sitting around. - What do you take us for?

614
00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:54,995
- You made us sleep here already. - Why did you bring us here then?

615
00:23:54,995 --> 00:23:56,295
Goodness, seriously.

616
00:23:56,295 --> 00:23:59,595
Around here, there's an amusement park ride that's ranked on...

617
00:23:59,595 --> 00:24:00,895
- Guinness World Records. - Gosh.

618
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:03,025
- Is this it? - What?

619
00:24:04,595 --> 00:24:06,255
- Oh, no. - Are you talking about this?

620
00:24:06,255 --> 00:24:07,395
(Are you sure it's this?)

621
00:24:09,095 --> 00:24:12,325
(The roller coaster climbs straight up above the ground.)

622
00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:14,425
(At the end of the climbing, )

623
00:24:16,225 --> 00:24:18,495
(you arrive at a dropping point which is 43m high above the ground.)

624
00:24:20,295 --> 00:24:22,555
(And...)

625
00:24:22,555 --> 00:24:25,925
(they slowly encounter...)

626
00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:31,655
(the extreme fear of the inverse slope that's 121°.)

627
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:37,955
(They'll have another extreme experience following the Labyrinth.)

628
00:24:38,695 --> 00:24:40,725
Let's ride this first since it's nearby.

629
00:24:40,925 --> 00:24:43,055
Let's move onto the legendary pond after.

630
00:24:43,055 --> 00:24:45,125
(He's found another one.)

631
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,955
(Legendary pond?)

632
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:49,025
- "Legendary pond"? - It's a pond?

633
00:24:49,025 --> 00:24:52,225
It's at Oshino Hakkai Springs in Yamanashi Prefecture.

634
00:24:52,225 --> 00:24:53,655
Why do they sound so scary?

635
00:24:53,895 --> 00:24:55,095
This seems amazing.

636
00:24:55,095 --> 00:24:56,125
It feels frightening.

637
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,655
"It's part of Mount Fuji."

638
00:24:58,655 --> 00:25:00,395
It's also been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.

639
00:25:01,495 --> 00:25:02,555
(By the way)

640
00:25:02,555 --> 00:25:05,025
How should I get on that ride? Are you good at riding those?

641
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:06,055
Well...

642
00:25:06,055 --> 00:25:08,795
- What? - What's the sound?

643
00:25:09,895 --> 00:25:11,655
(They suddenly hear a mysterious chime bell sound.)

644
00:25:11,655 --> 00:25:12,895
It's in the morning...

645
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:14,725
Thank goodness, it's bright now.

646
00:25:14,725 --> 00:25:17,395
- It's still scary in the morning. - At least it's bright.

647
00:25:17,395 --> 00:25:19,355
I would've wondered what it was if the sound had been creepier.

648
00:25:19,525 --> 00:25:21,255
- Thank goodness, it's bright now. - Gosh, here...

649
00:25:21,995 --> 00:25:23,395
(Startled)

650
00:25:23,395 --> 00:25:25,025
(They become stiff.)

651
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:27,455
- The amusement park must be open. - Gosh, it's scary.

652
00:25:27,455 --> 00:25:28,495
What is going on?

653
00:25:28,495 --> 00:25:31,395
- The amusement park must be open. - Gosh, it's scary.

654
00:25:31,395 --> 00:25:32,595
- I guess. - Let's get going.

655
00:25:32,725 --> 00:25:34,125
Let's not waste time and hurry.

656
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:35,395
(Bell ringing)

657
00:25:35,395 --> 00:25:36,655
(Darn it.)

658
00:25:37,855 --> 00:25:39,225
Gosh, let's go.

659
00:25:39,595 --> 00:25:41,825
- I almost swore just now. - You did.

660
00:25:41,825 --> 00:25:42,995
- Let's go. - All right.

661
00:25:42,995 --> 00:25:44,825
- It's open. - The music is exciting.

662
00:25:44,825 --> 00:25:46,125
(They head to find the 1st place items.)

663
00:25:47,725 --> 00:25:49,795
Roller coasters here are unbelievable.

664
00:25:49,795 --> 00:25:52,695
They all look so scary.

665
00:25:53,955 --> 00:25:55,095
Look.

666
00:25:55,295 --> 00:25:56,995
It's dropping straight down.

667
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,725
Straight down.

668
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,625
(I guess everything's at right angle in here.)

669
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:01,725
That's ridiculous.

670
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:06,225
I hear people scream all around here.

671
00:26:06,225 --> 00:26:07,295
(Where's the ride in 1st place?)

672
00:26:07,295 --> 00:26:08,525
Where is the ride we're looking for?

673
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,995
(Where's the ride in 1st place?)

674
00:26:12,025 --> 00:26:13,825
That must be it.

675
00:26:14,255 --> 00:26:15,825
- Where? - Over there.

676
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,225
(Did they find the roller coaster?)

677
00:26:17,225 --> 00:26:19,055
(Bingo)

678
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:23,255
(Guinness World Records admitted to its steep slope.)

679
00:26:25,095 --> 00:26:28,325
(It's called Takabisha.)

680
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:32,755
(It's also known as Four Great Scream Machine.)

681
00:26:36,355 --> 00:26:38,855
(It's frightening just by looking at it.)

682
00:26:38,855 --> 00:26:39,855
Does it descend vertically?

683
00:26:39,855 --> 00:26:41,925
(Is that the roller coaster we must ride?)

684
00:26:41,925 --> 00:26:42,925
There's no way.

685
00:26:43,525 --> 00:26:45,495
Gosh, what do we do?

686
00:26:45,495 --> 00:26:46,495
(Their jaws drop down.)

687
00:26:47,195 --> 00:26:49,755
It curves inward, so the angle is more than 90º.

688
00:26:49,755 --> 00:26:51,795
(The slope is 121º.)

689
00:26:52,925 --> 00:26:56,625
(Takabisha makes your whole body tremble.)

690
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:59,055
Gosh, that looks intense.

691
00:27:00,255 --> 00:27:02,425
Let me explain the rules.

692
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,755
The 1st Place Tour is a team competition,

693
00:27:04,795 --> 00:27:07,095
but you collect the stamps individually.

694
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:10,425
(Stamps are collected individually.)

695
00:27:10,425 --> 00:27:13,355
Based on your decision to stay with the team or not,

696
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:16,125
the result will vary.

697
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:17,925
(They must choose every time.)

698
00:27:18,225 --> 00:27:19,895
You may choose...

699
00:27:19,895 --> 00:27:21,625
to be together or separate.

700
00:27:22,495 --> 00:27:24,195
If you choose to be together,

701
00:27:24,495 --> 00:27:28,225
the result of the roulette will apply to all of you.

702
00:27:28,225 --> 00:27:29,595
(The result applies to all if they choose to be together.)

703
00:27:30,225 --> 00:27:31,995
If you choose to be separate,

704
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:36,495
the result of the ladder will apply to you individually.

705
00:27:36,495 --> 00:27:37,925
(The result of the ladder applies individually.)

706
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:39,955
(A stamp makes you exempt from the activity.)

707
00:27:39,955 --> 00:27:40,995
Do we get to choose?

708
00:27:40,995 --> 00:27:42,925
This is if we're together.

709
00:27:42,925 --> 00:27:44,955
- That's if we're separate. - Right.

710
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,095
We should go separately then.

711
00:27:46,095 --> 00:27:48,125
(We should go separately then.)

712
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,495
(He chooses to go separately without hesitating.)

713
00:27:50,495 --> 00:27:52,725
What about what you said yesterday?

714
00:27:52,725 --> 00:27:54,025
You said we should win as a team.

715
00:27:54,025 --> 00:27:55,395
- Suddenly... - We should go separately.

716
00:27:55,395 --> 00:27:56,755
Will you play individually?

717
00:27:56,755 --> 00:27:58,395
That's not why.

718
00:27:58,395 --> 00:28:00,855
Isn't it better for the team if we increase the probability?

719
00:28:01,025 --> 00:28:02,625
Right? Let's try it.

720
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,225
- Okay. - Say your decision out loud.

721
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:05,695
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

722
00:28:05,695 --> 00:28:07,855
(Which will they choose?)

723
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:09,455
- Separate. - Individual.

724
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:10,695
(Individual, Separate, Separate)

725
00:28:11,555 --> 00:28:12,725
She said "individual".

726
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:14,695
(Individual)

727
00:28:15,495 --> 00:28:17,995
- Do you mean individualism? - Individual?

728
00:28:17,995 --> 00:28:18,995
Why did you say that?

729
00:28:18,995 --> 00:28:20,125
- It's done deal. - We all chose to go separately.

730
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:22,125
- Let's play separately. - Let's do that.

731
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:23,695
- Let's play separately. - It can be a war.

732
00:28:23,695 --> 00:28:24,925
- I don't know. - I don't know.

733
00:28:24,925 --> 00:28:25,925
I don't know.

734
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:27,755
- I choose number 2. - Number 2?

735
00:28:27,755 --> 00:28:31,255
(Lucky Ji Hyo chooses number 2.)

736
00:28:31,255 --> 00:28:34,495
(Will she be exempt from riding Takabisha?)

737
00:28:34,495 --> 00:28:35,495
That's right.

738
00:28:36,695 --> 00:28:38,425
I'm number two.

739
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,895
- Okay. - That's Ji Hyo.

740
00:28:40,295 --> 00:28:41,755
- I choose number 1. - Number 1?

741
00:28:44,795 --> 00:28:45,795
Se Chan.

742
00:28:45,795 --> 00:28:47,325
(Each person gets a slot.)

743
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:49,225
- Seok Jin gets this automatically. - This one.

744
00:28:49,225 --> 00:28:50,225
Seok Jin.

745
00:28:50,525 --> 00:28:51,725
Will we get a stamp without riding it?

746
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,325
(They can get a stamp without riding it.)

747
00:28:55,055 --> 00:28:57,425
In 1, 2, 3.

748
00:28:57,425 --> 00:28:59,625
(What's the result of the separate ladder?)

749
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,195
(It seems unlucky.)

750
00:29:05,395 --> 00:29:07,525
- What's going on? - It seems unlucky.

751
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:09,725
- It seems unlucky. - Why is it like this?

752
00:29:09,855 --> 00:29:10,895
Take it off slowly.

753
00:29:10,895 --> 00:29:12,125
(Is it an omen?)

754
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,355
What's the result?

755
00:29:13,855 --> 00:29:14,855
O?

756
00:29:15,025 --> 00:29:16,395
- Stamp? - I get a stamp.

757
00:29:16,525 --> 00:29:17,755
I get a stamp.

758
00:29:18,755 --> 00:29:20,555
- Will he be exempt too? - I get a stamp.

759
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:22,125
I hope he'll have to ride it.

760
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:23,525
He should ride it.

761
00:29:23,525 --> 00:29:27,755
(If he's exempt from getting on the ride, he's very lucky.)

762
00:29:27,755 --> 00:29:29,025
(It's a circle.)

763
00:29:29,025 --> 00:29:31,125
(They see a circle.)

764
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,395
(One person gets on the ride.)

765
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,425
Se Chan.

766
00:29:33,425 --> 00:29:34,925
(One person gets on the ride.)

767
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:38,895
(He's in despair.)

768
00:29:39,725 --> 00:29:42,895
(They're happy as long as it's not them.)

769
00:29:42,895 --> 00:29:46,395
(Seok Jin will ride Takabisha.)

770
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:48,725
(The second slot is revealed.)

771
00:29:48,725 --> 00:29:51,125
- Do it from the back. - I'm in trouble.

772
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,125
Let's see.

773
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:53,695
(Will Se Chan be exempted?)

774
00:29:53,695 --> 00:29:55,125
- I'll take it off slowly. - Slowly.

775
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:58,095
- Am I exempt? - You shouldn't be.

776
00:29:58,495 --> 00:30:00,125
You have to. Please.

777
00:30:00,295 --> 00:30:02,425
If so, I'm automatically exempt.

778
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,425
He has to ride it.

779
00:30:03,655 --> 00:30:06,225
(He has to go on the ride.)

780
00:30:06,225 --> 00:30:09,125
(Takabisha is full.)

781
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:11,295
(However)

782
00:30:11,925 --> 00:30:13,395
(There is no stamp.)

783
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:16,955
(Se Chan gets no stamp.)

784
00:30:16,955 --> 00:30:18,795
(He remains unlucky in Japan.)

785
00:30:18,795 --> 00:30:20,595
- Gosh. - Se Chan...

786
00:30:20,595 --> 00:30:22,055
is very unlucky.

787
00:30:22,825 --> 00:30:24,755
You should take my misfortune.

788
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,325
You're so lucky, Ji Hyo.

789
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,025
(She gets a stamp and is exempted.)

790
00:30:30,225 --> 00:30:34,455
You'll go on the ride. Put on the camera on your wrist.

791
00:30:34,525 --> 00:30:37,695
Your cameraman will also go on the ride...

792
00:30:37,895 --> 00:30:39,895
in the seat next to you.

793
00:30:40,955 --> 00:30:44,755
(They're the cowardly cameramen from Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.)

794
00:30:45,055 --> 00:30:47,425
It's not friendly between the two.

795
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:49,725
I haven't made eye contact with him since this morning.

796
00:30:51,425 --> 00:30:54,295
(At Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear the night before)

797
00:30:54,295 --> 00:30:57,125
(He finds his name tag before other members.)

798
00:30:57,125 --> 00:31:01,695
(He leaves the labyrinth faster than anyone.)

799
00:31:01,695 --> 00:31:05,125
(How could he leave without me?)

800
00:31:06,055 --> 00:31:08,495
You can't get off in the middle of the ride.

801
00:31:08,795 --> 00:31:11,025
- That's true. - We're in this together.

802
00:31:11,025 --> 00:31:14,195
You ran away yesterday, but you have to stay this time.

803
00:31:14,725 --> 00:31:16,395
- Here you go. - What?

804
00:31:16,495 --> 00:31:18,225
Do I have to ride it?

805
00:31:18,225 --> 00:31:20,125
- You have to ride it. - I really don't want to.

806
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,125
He doesn't want to.

807
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:22,125
You must ride it.

808
00:31:22,525 --> 00:31:25,125
Do you think I want to ride it?

809
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:26,195
(Their friendship is at risk.)

810
00:31:27,295 --> 00:31:30,625
Why am I walking toward the ride?

811
00:31:30,925 --> 00:31:35,125
What happens if I refuse to do it?

812
00:31:35,225 --> 00:31:36,525
Can't I refuse?

813
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:38,595
- Then... - It's a democratic country.

814
00:31:38,595 --> 00:31:40,325
You should just go home.

815
00:31:40,325 --> 00:31:43,025
(You should just go home, Seok Jin.)

816
00:31:43,025 --> 00:31:44,695
- Why are you here? - Why?

817
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:46,655
Get him a flight so he can go home.

818
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,125
You should go home.

819
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:51,125
(You're so merciless.)

820
00:31:52,855 --> 00:31:53,855
My goodness.

821
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:55,625
This is insane.

822
00:31:55,725 --> 00:31:57,755
- See you, Se Chan. - I'll come back alive.

823
00:31:57,755 --> 00:31:59,855
I already get the chills.

824
00:32:00,725 --> 00:32:02,295
Ji Hyo, I'll stay alive.

825
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,955
Bye, Se Chan.

826
00:32:06,755 --> 00:32:08,855
Let's take a photo together.

827
00:32:09,695 --> 00:32:11,755
In 1, 2, 3.

828
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:15,395
(They smile and say goodbye. Poor cameraman)

829
00:32:16,855 --> 00:32:18,855
- See you. - Goodbye.

830
00:32:19,425 --> 00:32:21,295
How does this work?

831
00:32:21,295 --> 00:32:24,495
(The four start their thrilling journey.)

832
00:32:24,495 --> 00:32:25,495
What's this?

833
00:32:25,855 --> 00:32:27,595
Hello.

834
00:32:27,925 --> 00:32:30,125
- No way. - What's going on?

835
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:32,695
It's so dark here. Why am I on this ride?

836
00:32:33,395 --> 00:32:34,955
(It's the vertical accelerating part.)

837
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:36,295
(Yelling)

838
00:32:37,495 --> 00:32:40,025
(Screaming)

839
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:43,295
(Everyone screams on top of the lungs.)

840
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:47,225
(They start when they come out of the tunnel.)

841
00:32:47,225 --> 00:32:49,225
(Consecutive 360º turns)

842
00:32:49,225 --> 00:32:51,125
(Screaming)

843
00:32:52,255 --> 00:32:54,495
(He films with his eyes closed.)

844
00:32:55,695 --> 00:32:58,395
Yoo Seok couldn't film Seok Jin at all.

845
00:32:58,425 --> 00:32:59,495
I saw him.

846
00:32:59,495 --> 00:33:01,595
He had his eyes closed.

847
00:33:02,325 --> 00:33:03,425
I saw him.

848
00:33:05,495 --> 00:33:07,395
That happened so suddenly.

849
00:33:07,525 --> 00:33:09,225
Is this the end?

850
00:33:09,225 --> 00:33:10,495
No, it's just starting.

851
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:14,295
- I'm nauseous. - Is it starting only now?

852
00:33:14,295 --> 00:33:16,625
(It already felt like a long ride.)

853
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:19,125
This can't be the start.

854
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:20,255
(How can it be the start?)

855
00:33:20,255 --> 00:33:22,295
(They lose their minds.)

856
00:33:22,755 --> 00:33:24,295
I can't do it.

857
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:27,425
Is it 90º?

858
00:33:28,695 --> 00:33:31,025
- It's over. - I'm really sorry.

859
00:33:31,025 --> 00:33:32,025
What's going on?

860
00:33:32,825 --> 00:33:35,825
(The sight makes your hair stand.)

861
00:33:36,295 --> 00:33:41,295
(It's a vertical ascend of 90º.)

862
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,125
What's this? I see the sky.

863
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:45,125
(The fall is at 43m from the ground.)

864
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,325
Please.

865
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:48,425
(The fall is at 43m from the ground.)

866
00:33:48,425 --> 00:33:49,755
What's going on?

867
00:33:49,755 --> 00:33:50,755
I can't breathe.

868
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,125
What should we do?

869
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:54,755
Endure it, Seok Jin.

870
00:33:55,725 --> 00:33:56,725
I can't.

871
00:34:00,495 --> 00:34:02,255
Why am I here?

872
00:34:02,295 --> 00:34:04,125
- Stop the ride. - Don't look down.

873
00:34:04,895 --> 00:34:05,895
My goodness.

874
00:34:05,895 --> 00:34:08,425
(The fear is extreme.)

875
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:12,895
(The ride stops right before it descends.)

876
00:34:12,895 --> 00:34:15,025
- No way. - I'm scared.

877
00:34:15,025 --> 00:34:17,125
- I can't open my eyes. - I can't see the ground.

878
00:34:17,295 --> 00:34:19,525
- Gosh. - What's going on?

879
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:20,595
What's going on?

880
00:34:20,755 --> 00:34:22,225
(It's time...)

881
00:34:22,225 --> 00:34:27,395
(It's time to fall.)

882
00:34:30,055 --> 00:34:32,125
(How does it feel?)

883
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:34,525
(Is it your first time riding the world's best roller coaster?)

884
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:39,655
(The face experiences the thrill.)

885
00:34:42,525 --> 00:34:45,125
(It's the best facial muscle show.)

886
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:47,095
I'm sorry.

887
00:34:47,895 --> 00:34:51,525
(It's a moving scene.)

888
00:34:51,855 --> 00:34:52,925
(Se Chan's face...)

889
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:56,495
(and Takabisha make the best combination.)

890
00:34:56,495 --> 00:34:58,125
This is unbelievable.

891
00:35:00,055 --> 00:35:01,425
- I'm nauseous. - I saw the ground.

892
00:35:02,055 --> 00:35:03,055
Over there.

893
00:35:03,225 --> 00:35:04,555
The ride is over.

894
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:06,395
Yoo Seok.

895
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,125
(Did they arrive safely?)

896
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:10,325
I couldn't take photos of them.

897
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:12,695
Gosh, it was hilarious.

898
00:35:14,495 --> 00:35:15,655
(He heaves a sigh.)

899
00:35:17,855 --> 00:35:19,125
(He's about to pass out.)

900
00:35:20,025 --> 00:35:21,855
You look dizzy.

901
00:35:22,725 --> 00:35:24,625
It's impossible to ride it.

902
00:35:25,225 --> 00:35:26,225
You shouldn't...

903
00:35:26,795 --> 00:35:30,355
ride this roller coaster.

904
00:35:32,855 --> 00:35:34,025
Are you okay?

905
00:35:34,695 --> 00:35:35,795
Are you okay?

906
00:35:35,795 --> 00:35:37,755
(He's thankful for still being alive.)

907
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:41,125
(Ji Hyo and Seok Jin get a stamp.)

908
00:35:42,395 --> 00:35:45,525
(Team Hye Sung in Tokyo)

909
00:35:45,525 --> 00:35:46,825
Is he still sleeping?

910
00:35:46,825 --> 00:35:48,325
(One person is missing.)

911
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:49,655
Didn't he set his alarm?

912
00:35:50,395 --> 00:35:51,525
Let's go.

913
00:35:51,795 --> 00:35:54,055
(They look for Kwang Soo.)

914
00:35:55,025 --> 00:35:56,525
Is he really sleeping?

915
00:35:56,525 --> 00:35:57,695
It's the 10th floor.

916
00:35:58,595 --> 00:36:02,025
I sent him a message, but he didn't respond.

917
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:03,495
It was a while back.

918
00:36:03,855 --> 00:36:04,925
This is the room.

919
00:36:04,925 --> 00:36:07,225
(Is he too tired to get up?)

920
00:36:07,225 --> 00:36:08,625
(They ring the bell.)

921
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:11,125
(It's quiet.)

922
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,225
Is this the room?

923
00:36:12,695 --> 00:36:13,725
It is.

924
00:36:13,725 --> 00:36:15,495
(What's going on?)

925
00:36:15,495 --> 00:36:19,525
(Why isn't he answering?)

926
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:21,725
(Ringing)

927
00:36:22,425 --> 00:36:24,925
(What are you doing, Kwang Soo?)

928
00:36:27,055 --> 00:36:33,795
(Last night, she confessed that she had mood swings.)

929
00:36:33,795 --> 00:36:38,825
(You never know when her mood will change.)

930
00:36:38,825 --> 00:36:42,095
(I'm here, Kwang Soo.)

931
00:36:42,095 --> 00:36:43,225
(The door opens.)

932
00:36:44,395 --> 00:36:47,525
(Kwang Soo's door finally opens.)

933
00:36:47,995 --> 00:36:49,195
This is not okay.

934
00:36:49,195 --> 00:36:50,855
- Kwang Soo, this is not okay. - Kwang Soo.

935
00:36:50,855 --> 00:36:52,525
What's going on?

936
00:36:55,795 --> 00:36:57,895
It's 10am.

937
00:36:57,895 --> 00:36:59,725
What happened to your nose?

938
00:36:59,795 --> 00:37:00,925
Gosh.

939
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:02,965
- What about my nose? - What happened?

940
00:37:02,965 --> 00:37:04,465
- He's not wearing pants. - Kwang Soo.

941
00:37:04,465 --> 00:37:06,755
- He's not wearing pants. - Hey.

942
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:08,825
Kwang Soo is not wearing pants.

943
00:37:08,825 --> 00:37:10,125
I shouldn't look.

944
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:12,295
Kwang Soo, put on your pants.

945
00:37:13,495 --> 00:37:14,555
Hey.

946
00:37:14,555 --> 00:37:17,355
We're late because of you.

947
00:37:17,355 --> 00:37:19,095
- Get ready. - Kwang Soo.

948
00:37:19,825 --> 00:37:21,855
Are you sure you just woke up?

949
00:37:22,425 --> 00:37:26,625
You look quite okay.

950
00:37:26,655 --> 00:37:31,965
(Wait, what did you just say, Hye Sung?)

951
00:37:31,965 --> 00:37:35,355
You look like you're in the middle of a photo shoot.

952
00:37:35,355 --> 00:37:36,695
(Do I look good right now?)

953
00:37:36,695 --> 00:37:38,195
This is fun.

954
00:37:38,395 --> 00:37:39,725
(Hye Sung and Kwang Soo show off their chemistry.)

955
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:42,425
Thanks to Kwang Soo, we're starting our day laughing.

956
00:37:42,925 --> 00:37:46,995
(Something is going on between Hye Sung and Kwang Soo.)

957
00:37:48,055 --> 00:37:49,465
How much time do you need?

958
00:37:49,465 --> 00:37:50,925
10 minutes, I promise.

959
00:37:51,025 --> 00:37:53,625
- What about five? - I'm sorry.

960
00:37:53,695 --> 00:37:55,595
Okay, five minutes.

961
00:37:55,595 --> 00:37:57,095
- Five minutes. - Okay.

962
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:58,925
I'll keep track of the time.

963
00:37:59,055 --> 00:38:00,425
Hye Sung will keep track of the time.

964
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:02,855
(You have exactly 5 minutes.)

965
00:38:02,855 --> 00:38:07,055
(Will Kwang Soo get ready within 5 minutes?)

966
00:38:08,855 --> 00:38:09,855
Keep track of the time.

967
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:13,295
(Brushing teeth)

968
00:38:13,295 --> 00:38:16,225
(Changing)

969
00:38:16,225 --> 00:38:19,055
You're lucky that our guest today is Hye Sung.

970
00:38:19,055 --> 00:38:20,625
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

971
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:22,355
You know what might have happened otherwise.

972
00:38:22,355 --> 00:38:23,655
(Time is our advantage.)

973
00:38:23,655 --> 00:38:25,755
- Are we doomed? - Yes, we are.

974
00:38:25,755 --> 00:38:28,295
No. I'll make it up to you.

975
00:38:29,395 --> 00:38:30,655
This is so fun.

976
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,255
- Even if we fail, it'll be fun. - Of course.

977
00:38:32,255 --> 00:38:35,125
- I'm sorry, Hye Sung. - It's okay.

978
00:38:35,255 --> 00:38:36,855
- It's okay to fail. - It'll be good memories.

979
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:38,025
You're right.

980
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:42,195
- It'll be good memories. - When will we get to do this again?

981
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:43,925
With a guy who looks like your sister.

982
00:38:43,925 --> 00:38:47,325
(I'm sorry.)

983
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:53,095
(This has never happened in the past 7 years.)

984
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:55,655
This is nice.

985
00:38:55,655 --> 00:38:59,025
(I kept everyone waiting.)

986
00:38:59,025 --> 00:39:00,695
- I'm sorry, Hye Sung. - It's okay.

987
00:39:00,695 --> 00:39:03,725
I'll make it up to you.

988
00:39:03,725 --> 00:39:05,025
I'll do my best today.

989
00:39:05,025 --> 00:39:06,755
(I'll make it up to you.)

990
00:39:06,755 --> 00:39:07,995
It's okay, Kwang Soo.

991
00:39:07,995 --> 00:39:10,225
(Team Hye Sung starts their tour a bit late.)

992
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:12,025
We have to travel as little as possible.

993
00:39:12,465 --> 00:39:13,725
Are we going...

994
00:39:13,855 --> 00:39:15,555
- to the tallest... - Tower.

995
00:39:15,555 --> 00:39:17,055
- Exactly. - The broadcasting tower.

996
00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:21,255
(They checked this 1st place spot last night.)

997
00:39:21,255 --> 00:39:24,795
(They're on their way to Tokyo Skytree.)

998
00:39:27,695 --> 00:39:29,595
You don't want this picture?

999
00:39:29,655 --> 00:39:31,855
- I gave it to you. - You look so cute.

1000
00:39:31,855 --> 00:39:33,925
(You look so cute.)

1001
00:39:35,255 --> 00:39:37,555
(Do I look cute?)

1002
00:39:38,925 --> 00:39:40,025
Right?

1003
00:39:40,325 --> 00:39:43,125
Kwang Soo is so cute.

1004
00:39:43,225 --> 00:39:45,125
- He's cute. - He's cute.

1005
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:48,255
- He's really cute. - He's really cute.

1006
00:39:48,965 --> 00:39:50,855
Amazing.

1007
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:52,595
He's so cute.

1008
00:39:52,595 --> 00:39:54,395
(Hye Sung fell for my charm.)

1009
00:39:54,755 --> 00:39:58,255
Your nickname should be Cute.

1010
00:39:58,255 --> 00:39:59,625
In Korea, your nickname is Love.

1011
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:00,995
- Here, it's Cute. - Cute.

1012
00:40:02,425 --> 00:40:05,965
(Team Hye Sung is full of love.)

1013
00:40:05,965 --> 00:40:08,325
(They'll arrive at the world's tallest broadcasting tower soon.)

1014
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:10,025
Gosh, it's so tall.

1015
00:40:10,855 --> 00:40:12,325
- Look at that. - Oh, my.

1016
00:40:12,325 --> 00:40:13,895
(The world's tallest tower)

1017
00:40:13,895 --> 00:40:15,355
It's so tall.

1018
00:40:17,555 --> 00:40:22,495
(Guinness World Records states it as the world's tallest tower.)

1019
00:40:22,495 --> 00:40:26,355
(It's the 2nd-tallest man-made structure in the world.)

1020
00:40:26,355 --> 00:40:28,965
(The world's tallest broadcasting tower, Tokyo Skytree)

1021
00:40:29,655 --> 00:40:31,325
As you will see soon,

1022
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,755
you will do something fun.

1023
00:40:34,425 --> 00:40:36,755
(Sorry?)

1024
00:40:36,755 --> 00:40:38,225
(The producer is putting us to the test again.)

1025
00:40:38,225 --> 00:40:39,295
What?

1026
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,325
What are we going to do?

1027
00:40:41,325 --> 00:40:42,325
(Worried)

1028
00:40:42,595 --> 00:40:43,725
Are we bungee-jumping?

1029
00:40:43,965 --> 00:40:45,125
There is...

1030
00:40:45,395 --> 00:40:48,595
a very popular activity here.

1031
00:40:48,595 --> 00:40:50,195
Is it something like sky-walking?

1032
00:40:50,195 --> 00:40:51,965
(What is waiting for us at the top of the tower?)

1033
00:40:52,895 --> 00:40:55,795
(There is an activity at the top of the tower?)

1034
00:40:57,195 --> 00:40:59,525
Together or separate?

1035
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:01,995
(They have to choose between together and separate.)

1036
00:41:01,995 --> 00:41:04,625
(Together or separate?)

1037
00:41:05,595 --> 00:41:07,255
- Hye Sung, I'm sorry. - It's okay.

1038
00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:13,055
(Kwang Soo promised he'd commit to the team.)

1039
00:41:15,025 --> 00:41:18,795
(He makes up his mind after thinking for a moment.)

1040
00:41:18,795 --> 00:41:22,225
- Separate. - Okay.

1041
00:41:23,225 --> 00:41:26,125
(Separate?)

1042
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:31,125
(I knew it.)

1043
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:32,355
My goodness.

1044
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:34,225
Hye Sung, which number?

1045
00:41:34,795 --> 00:41:36,125
- You can choose first. - You choose first.

1046
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:37,495
You decided.

1047
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,695
(The 1st Place Tour)

1048
00:41:38,695 --> 00:41:39,755
Number three.

1049
00:41:39,995 --> 00:41:41,055
Let's see.

1050
00:41:41,055 --> 00:41:43,795
(What will Kwang Soo get?)

1051
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:44,855
Here.

1052
00:41:44,855 --> 00:41:45,895
One.

1053
00:41:46,725 --> 00:41:47,855
Two.

1054
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:48,925
1, 2, 3.

1055
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:53,555
(He has to participate without getting a stamp.)

1056
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:58,725
(We knew it when he confidently chose "separate".)

1057
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:01,495
(It serves you right.)

1058
00:42:01,495 --> 00:42:04,125
(Kwang Soo is participating in the activity.)

1059
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:06,255
(Hye Sung makes a choice.)

1060
00:42:06,255 --> 00:42:07,555
- Number 1. - Number 1?

1061
00:42:07,555 --> 00:42:08,695
She chooses number one.

1062
00:42:08,755 --> 00:42:10,495
(What will Hye Sung get?)

1063
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:11,625
1, 2, 3.

1064
00:42:11,965 --> 00:42:15,125
(Hye Sung is participating in the activity.)

1065
00:42:15,465 --> 00:42:18,555
(It means...)

1066
00:42:18,555 --> 00:42:19,925
(it's the two of us.)

1067
00:42:20,025 --> 00:42:21,855
Nice. You two go.

1068
00:42:21,855 --> 00:42:24,295
(It means it's the two of us.)

1069
00:42:24,295 --> 00:42:25,295
What's with me?

1070
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:26,725
(What's with me?)

1071
00:42:27,495 --> 00:42:28,595
What?

1072
00:42:28,695 --> 00:42:32,095
- It's a good thing. - See you.

1073
00:42:32,095 --> 00:42:33,255
You two go together.

1074
00:42:33,255 --> 00:42:35,255
(Anything is fine as long as we can do it together.)

1075
00:42:35,355 --> 00:42:36,755
- See you. - See you. Be careful.

1076
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:38,025
We'll see you in a while.

1077
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:40,225
- See you. Good luck. - We'll be quick.

1078
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:41,295
(Jong Kook will be waiting.)

1079
00:42:41,295 --> 00:42:42,595
What will we be doing?

1080
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:45,555
I hope it's bungee-jumping.

1081
00:42:47,325 --> 00:42:48,655
(They have to go to Observatory 1, which is 350m high.)

1082
00:42:48,655 --> 00:42:50,095
It's 350m high.

1083
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:53,125
Are we going up right now?

1084
00:42:54,755 --> 00:42:55,925
- My ears. - I feel pressure in my ears.

1085
00:42:55,925 --> 00:42:57,295
(They're going up at the speed of 600m per minute.)

1086
00:42:57,295 --> 00:42:59,325
We're going up at the speed of 600m per minute.

1087
00:43:00,655 --> 00:43:02,595
(In 50 seconds, they're 350m high.)

1088
00:43:02,595 --> 00:43:03,795
Are we already 350m high?

1089
00:43:04,965 --> 00:43:06,425
Are we 350m high?

1090
00:43:06,755 --> 00:43:08,055
Unbelievable.

1091
00:43:08,055 --> 00:43:09,555
(Kwang Soo's jaw drops.)

1092
00:43:10,595 --> 00:43:13,755
(How does the world's tallest broadcasting tower look?)

1093
00:43:14,995 --> 00:43:17,925
(It's so high.)

1094
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:19,125
It's so high.

1095
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:24,425
(Tokyo is at your feet.)

1096
00:43:24,425 --> 00:43:27,655
(The tower provides amazing views over the city.)

1097
00:43:28,055 --> 00:43:31,695
(What will Kwang Soo and Hye Sung be doing here?)

1098
00:43:32,755 --> 00:43:34,925
(Kwang Soo is scared.)

1099
00:43:34,925 --> 00:43:36,025
Amazing.

1100
00:43:36,025 --> 00:43:37,055
(Hye Sung is excited.)

1101
00:43:37,725 --> 00:43:39,295
Don't worry about me. I can see from here.

1102
00:43:39,295 --> 00:43:40,965
(Don't do it.)

1103
00:43:40,965 --> 00:43:42,455
- You don't like it? - No.

1104
00:43:43,295 --> 00:43:46,025
(The skyscrapers look like toys.)

1105
00:43:46,025 --> 00:43:47,195
This is beautiful.

1106
00:43:47,195 --> 00:43:48,225
(Holding onto the handrail tightly)

1107
00:43:49,825 --> 00:43:53,425
(I didn't want to look like this in front of Hye Sung.)

1108
00:43:53,425 --> 00:43:54,825
It is very high.

1109
00:43:54,825 --> 00:43:57,495
(From the outside, they look like a cute couple.)

1110
00:43:57,755 --> 00:44:00,955
(What activity will they participate in?)

1111
00:44:01,355 --> 00:44:03,195
It's your turn soon. Get in line.

1112
00:44:03,195 --> 00:44:04,295
What are we doing?

1113
00:44:06,325 --> 00:44:08,625
You have to stand on this.

1114
00:44:11,825 --> 00:44:13,255
(Enjoy the horror of the height.)

1115
00:44:13,255 --> 00:44:15,555
It makes me dizzy.

1116
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:18,495
What are you talking about?

1117
00:44:19,695 --> 00:44:21,395
Kwang Soo, it makes you dizzy.

1118
00:44:22,355 --> 00:44:24,725
(I can imagine.)

1119
00:44:25,695 --> 00:44:26,955
- Goodness. - Kwang Soo.

1120
00:44:28,825 --> 00:44:31,955
What is this?

1121
00:44:32,055 --> 00:44:33,055
Look here.

1122
00:44:33,725 --> 00:44:35,195
(Come here.)

1123
00:44:36,325 --> 00:44:37,925
You don't have to look down.

1124
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,255
- This is scary. - You don't have to look.

1125
00:44:39,755 --> 00:44:40,855
(Come on, Kwang Soo.)

1126
00:44:40,855 --> 00:44:42,955
- This is scary. - You don't have to look.

1127
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,395
Look somewhere else.

1128
00:44:45,395 --> 00:44:47,955
(You can rely on me.)

1129
00:44:48,195 --> 00:44:52,755
(It's okay. Don't be scared.)

1130
00:44:52,825 --> 00:44:54,055
Don't look.

1131
00:44:54,195 --> 00:44:55,255
It'll make you dizzy.

1132
00:44:55,255 --> 00:44:57,025
(Obedient)

1133
00:44:58,055 --> 00:45:03,355
(I can't back off in front of Hye Sung.)

1134
00:45:05,825 --> 00:45:08,595
(Under Hye Sung's guidance, Kwang Soo steps forward.)

1135
00:45:08,595 --> 00:45:10,425
Look down for three seconds.

1136
00:45:12,995 --> 00:45:14,855
(Hye Sung said she was attracted...)

1137
00:45:16,095 --> 00:45:19,195
(to a guy she could protect.)

1138
00:45:20,455 --> 00:45:22,595
Don't fall for me too much.

1139
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:26,595
(They were just joking around last night.)

1140
00:45:26,595 --> 00:45:27,795
- Three seconds. - Okay.

1141
00:45:27,795 --> 00:45:33,195
- 1, 2, 3. - I feel a tickle on my toes.

1142
00:45:33,195 --> 00:45:34,255
Done.

1143
00:45:34,255 --> 00:45:37,025
(They accomplished the Skytree mission.)

1144
00:45:38,325 --> 00:45:41,825
(Hye Sung has won 1 stamp.)

1145
00:45:42,055 --> 00:45:43,855
- It was fun, right? - Yes.

1146
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:48,355
(Yes, it was very fun.)

1147
00:45:50,295 --> 00:45:51,395
I like it.

1148
00:45:51,395 --> 00:45:53,955
(I like it.)

1149
00:45:53,955 --> 00:45:54,955
Sorry?

1150
00:45:55,755 --> 00:45:56,855
I like activities like this.

1151
00:45:57,025 --> 00:46:00,055
(Out of embarrassment, Kwang Soo tries to joke.)

1152
00:46:00,055 --> 00:46:03,325
I like it too.

1153
00:46:03,425 --> 00:46:07,325
(How can she be so unafraid?)

1154
00:46:07,425 --> 00:46:08,855
I like it too.

1155
00:46:08,855 --> 00:46:10,395
(Dizzy)

1156
00:46:13,295 --> 00:46:15,655
(Gulping)

1157
00:46:15,655 --> 00:46:17,695
(Her daring attitude makes him gulp.)

1158
00:46:18,295 --> 00:46:19,755
It feels like we're on a date.

1159
00:46:20,325 --> 00:46:21,495
You think so?

1160
00:46:21,795 --> 00:46:22,955
Yes.

1161
00:46:23,025 --> 00:46:24,595
You're so much taller than me.

1162
00:46:24,655 --> 00:46:27,195
- He really didn't like it. - Who?

1163
00:46:27,195 --> 00:46:29,125
- Kwang Soo? - He was afraid of the height.

1164
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:30,295
He was probably embarrassed.

1165
00:46:31,395 --> 00:46:32,925
- Is that so? - That's right.

1166
00:46:33,495 --> 00:46:35,325
(There is no need to be embarrassed.)

1167
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:36,695
She held my hand.

1168
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:39,125
(Kwang Soo is knocked out.)

1169
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:40,995
I don't know what to do.

1170
00:46:41,295 --> 00:46:44,225
I don't know what to do in this kind of situation.

1171
00:46:44,955 --> 00:46:46,725
I will have to study hard...

1172
00:46:46,855 --> 00:46:48,055
because I have a long way to go.

1173
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:50,125
Did you see Kwang Soo fall apart?

1174
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:52,555
When you held his hand, he pushed his shoulder down...

1175
00:46:52,555 --> 00:46:54,525
to make sure his hand meets yours. Did you see it?

1176
00:46:55,025 --> 00:46:57,295
He pushed his shoulder down a little.

1177
00:46:57,295 --> 00:47:00,025
I am swinging only my left hand just in case.

1178
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,225
His right hand is remaining still.

1179
00:47:02,495 --> 00:47:04,525
- Look at that. - You are cute.

1180
00:47:04,825 --> 00:47:07,425
- He is really cute. - He is cute.

1181
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:09,725
I heard that there was an incident in Russia.

1182
00:47:09,795 --> 00:47:11,225
It was hilarious.

1183
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:13,325
- I can explain. - He fell for a Russian woman.

1184
00:47:13,325 --> 00:47:14,895
I told you a little bit of it yesterday.

1185
00:47:15,195 --> 00:47:17,755
I was interacting...

1186
00:47:18,225 --> 00:47:19,925
with the captain's daughter.

1187
00:47:20,325 --> 00:47:21,595
Then he seduced her.

1188
00:47:21,825 --> 00:47:22,855
Jong Kook did that.

1189
00:47:22,855 --> 00:47:25,995
(Then he seduced her. Jong Kook did that.)

1190
00:47:25,995 --> 00:47:28,355
- I didn't seduce her. - He didn't help me out.

1191
00:47:28,355 --> 00:47:30,955
- I didn't do that. - He seduced her.

1192
00:47:30,955 --> 00:47:33,095
(That was mean of you, Jong Kook.)

1193
00:47:33,095 --> 00:47:34,495
My goodness.

1194
00:47:34,495 --> 00:47:36,095
That's why I am worried right now.

1195
00:47:37,225 --> 00:47:39,125
My goodness.

1196
00:47:39,125 --> 00:47:41,795
(I feel bad for Kwang Soo.)

1197
00:47:42,195 --> 00:47:44,795
(I will protect you.)

1198
00:47:45,525 --> 00:47:46,755
My goodness.

1199
00:47:46,755 --> 00:47:49,025
(I can't remain standing up.)

1200
00:47:49,025 --> 00:47:51,455
He collapsed.

1201
00:47:51,455 --> 00:47:52,995
Don't do that to him.

1202
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,455
(He comes 1st place when it comes to heart rate.)

1203
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:55,655
He is very cute.

1204
00:47:55,655 --> 00:47:57,995
(Will Kwang Soo and Hye Sung continue to flirt?)

1205
00:47:59,895 --> 00:48:01,295
(10:30am, Team So Min's ryokan)

1206
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,055
I feel so refreshed.

1207
00:48:03,055 --> 00:48:06,955
We need to go meet Ito Kenichi.

1208
00:48:06,955 --> 00:48:08,095
- The meeting time is approaching. - Really?

1209
00:48:08,095 --> 00:48:09,295
Then we should go right away.

1210
00:48:09,295 --> 00:48:12,025
Let's go. It will take some time to reach Tokyo.

1211
00:48:12,025 --> 00:48:13,225
(Let's go to Tokyo.)

1212
00:48:13,225 --> 00:48:14,695
Are we finally going to Tokyo?

1213
00:48:14,695 --> 00:48:16,355
I thought I wouldn't get to see Tokyo.

1214
00:48:18,055 --> 00:48:19,655
Other teams got a stamp.

1215
00:48:20,225 --> 00:48:21,455
What can we do?

1216
00:48:21,995 --> 00:48:23,495
We don't have much time.

1217
00:48:23,495 --> 00:48:24,925
It will be 1pm when we arrive.

1218
00:48:25,325 --> 00:48:26,395
The first place.

1219
00:48:26,395 --> 00:48:27,425
(Thinking hard)

1220
00:48:27,425 --> 00:48:28,455
The first place.

1221
00:48:29,095 --> 00:48:32,025
Can it be someone who is the first place in ugliness?

1222
00:48:32,025 --> 00:48:34,855
(The 1st place is sitting right next to me.)

1223
00:48:34,855 --> 00:48:36,555
- If you do it properly... - Really?

1224
00:48:37,095 --> 00:48:40,325
We can stop a passer-by and compare him to Jae Seok.

1225
00:48:40,325 --> 00:48:41,395
(Offended)

1226
00:48:41,395 --> 00:48:43,355
Haha, you are in no position to talk.

1227
00:48:43,355 --> 00:48:44,755
(You are in no position to talk.)

1228
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,425
You look very ugly right now.

1229
00:48:47,055 --> 00:48:48,925
When you were soaking in the hot spring,

1230
00:48:49,425 --> 00:48:51,895
your face was as big as a mountain.

1231
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:53,095
(I saw a sunfish at the hot spring.)

1232
00:48:56,395 --> 00:48:58,595
This park is very pretty.

1233
00:48:58,695 --> 00:49:00,795
There is a track.

1234
00:49:01,025 --> 00:49:02,955
There are a lot of runners.

1235
00:49:02,955 --> 00:49:05,055
That man has a sense of presence.

1236
00:49:05,455 --> 00:49:07,055
I have seen him on TV.

1237
00:49:07,055 --> 00:49:08,555
He is very fast.

1238
00:49:08,555 --> 00:49:10,555
I know what he looks like.

1239
00:49:11,025 --> 00:49:12,095
I will be able to recognize him if I look closely.

1240
00:49:12,095 --> 00:49:13,255
Ito Kenichi.

1241
00:49:13,355 --> 00:49:14,525
That's not him.

1242
00:49:14,525 --> 00:49:16,255
- No? - That's not him.

1243
00:49:16,255 --> 00:49:18,295
- Mr. Kenichi. - That's not him.

1244
00:49:18,295 --> 00:49:19,495
(I know because I saw him on TV.)

1245
00:49:19,495 --> 00:49:22,525
That's not him. I saw him on TV.

1246
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:23,955
Mr. Ito Kenichi.

1247
00:49:23,955 --> 00:49:25,125
I am telling you that's not him.

1248
00:49:25,125 --> 00:49:26,595
- I am sorry. - I am sorry.

1249
00:49:27,055 --> 00:49:30,195
Don't talk to people. For goodness' sake.

1250
00:49:30,195 --> 00:49:31,495
That must be him.

1251
00:49:31,955 --> 00:49:34,195
Mr. Ito Kenichi.

1252
00:49:34,195 --> 00:49:35,525
He isn't Ito Kenichi.

1253
00:49:35,525 --> 00:49:38,525
- That's not him. I told you. - He is really cool.

1254
00:49:38,525 --> 00:49:39,995
Can't you tell?

1255
00:49:39,995 --> 00:49:42,755
It's obvious that he isn't waiting to meet someone.

1256
00:49:43,895 --> 00:49:45,555
- What is it? - Is he over there?

1257
00:49:45,695 --> 00:49:47,055
Do you recognize him?

1258
00:49:47,225 --> 00:49:48,295
That's him.

1259
00:49:48,295 --> 00:49:49,295
(Jae Seok found someone.)

1260
00:49:50,025 --> 00:49:51,095
Are you Mr. Ito Kenichi?

1261
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:53,455
- Mr. Ito Kenichi. - Mr. Ito Kenichi.

1262
00:49:53,455 --> 00:49:55,695
(Are you Mr. Ito Kenichi?)

1263
00:49:57,255 --> 00:50:01,225
(Will they finally meet the 1st place holder?)

1264
00:50:02,525 --> 00:50:08,125
(The man who ran 100m in 15.71 seconds, Ito Kenichi)

1265
00:50:11,755 --> 00:50:12,955
(The man they only saw on TV...)

1266
00:50:12,955 --> 00:50:17,625
(is finally before them.)

1267
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:18,655
Mr. Ito Kenichi.

1268
00:50:18,655 --> 00:50:21,125
You are not allowed to film here. Please stop.

1269
00:50:21,125 --> 00:50:22,725
(Are they not allowed to film here?)

1270
00:50:22,725 --> 00:50:23,795
We can't film here.

1271
00:50:25,895 --> 00:50:27,055
We can't film here.

1272
00:50:27,725 --> 00:50:30,225
You can't film here without submitting a request.

1273
00:50:30,225 --> 00:50:33,125
Okay. We will stop.

1274
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:34,925
We can't film here.

1275
00:50:34,925 --> 00:50:36,725
(They have no permission to film due to the sudden shoot.)

1276
00:50:36,725 --> 00:50:39,255
(Will they be able to see the 1st place holder run on all fours?)

1277
00:50:39,895 --> 00:50:41,755
(30 minutes later)

1278
00:50:42,825 --> 00:50:46,395
(They resume the shoot at a nearby park.)

1279
00:50:46,395 --> 00:50:47,795
Everyone,

1280
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:49,725
you finally found Ito Kenichi,

1281
00:50:49,725 --> 00:50:52,395
the champion of running on all fours in The 1st Place Tour.

1282
00:50:52,395 --> 00:50:55,825
He is the person I saw on TV.

1283
00:50:55,825 --> 00:50:57,925
I imagined him...

1284
00:50:57,925 --> 00:50:59,295
- to be a tall man. - That's right.

1285
00:50:59,295 --> 00:51:01,255
I thought he would be muscular.

1286
00:51:01,255 --> 00:51:03,055
He has muscles like those of Bruce Lee.

1287
00:51:03,055 --> 00:51:04,855
He has compact muscles.

1288
00:51:04,855 --> 00:51:06,025
However,

1289
00:51:06,025 --> 00:51:08,095
while The 1st Place Tour is a match between the teams,

1290
00:51:08,695 --> 00:51:10,795
stamps will be given to individuals.

1291
00:51:10,995 --> 00:51:14,295
Decide whether or not to share the fate with the team members.

1292
00:51:14,295 --> 00:51:16,755
Your decision will change the result.

1293
00:51:16,755 --> 00:51:18,795
(Will they share the fate or not?)

1294
00:51:19,025 --> 00:51:20,495
Her eyes grew bigger.

1295
00:51:20,695 --> 00:51:22,295
I want to stay with my teammates.

1296
00:51:22,295 --> 00:51:23,695
(I want to stay with my teammates.)

1297
00:51:23,695 --> 00:51:24,755
Let's stay together.

1298
00:51:24,755 --> 00:51:26,725
Let's do this the clean way.

1299
00:51:27,025 --> 00:51:28,695
Sure.

1300
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:30,925
- Let's decide by majority. - Let's do that.

1301
00:51:30,925 --> 00:51:33,195
Who wants to do this separately?

1302
00:51:33,855 --> 00:51:36,555
(Me)

1303
00:51:36,855 --> 00:51:38,195
(It's every man for himself.)

1304
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:40,195
Then we will do this separately.

1305
00:51:40,195 --> 00:51:41,525
- It was bound to happen. - That's right.

1306
00:51:41,525 --> 00:51:42,995
I am sure other teams did the same thing.

1307
00:51:42,995 --> 00:51:45,555
- It's the ladder. - Is this what we will use?

1308
00:51:45,555 --> 00:51:47,455
There are three options.

1309
00:51:47,995 --> 00:51:50,095
Watch Mr. Ito Kenichi...

1310
00:51:50,625 --> 00:51:53,125
run on all fours and receive a stamp.

1311
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:56,325
Watch Mr. Ito Kenichi run on all fours,

1312
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:57,455
but fail to receive a stamp.

1313
00:51:57,455 --> 00:51:58,695
(You don't receive a stamp.)

1314
00:51:58,695 --> 00:52:01,395
Have a cameraman watch instead and fail to receive a stamp.

1315
00:52:01,725 --> 00:52:03,695
The person who chooses that option won't even get to see him run.

1316
00:52:03,695 --> 00:52:04,955
That person will have to leave.

1317
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:08,755
We came all the way here to see him run.

1318
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:10,795
- One of you will have to leave. - If we hadn't set up...

1319
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:12,695
a meeting with Mr. Ito Kenichi,

1320
00:52:12,695 --> 00:52:15,125
we could have visited two places.

1321
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:16,125
Let me ask again.

1322
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:17,725
Will you do this together or separately?

1323
00:52:17,725 --> 00:52:19,855
Let's raise our hands. Who wants to do this together?

1324
00:52:19,855 --> 00:52:22,225
In 1, 2, 3.

1325
00:52:22,395 --> 00:52:23,395
(Me)

1326
00:52:23,395 --> 00:52:25,495
We will do this separately.

1327
00:52:25,595 --> 00:52:27,395
I really want to watch this.

1328
00:52:27,725 --> 00:52:29,255
- This is the rule. - Okay.

1329
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:31,855
Now, let's choose the numbers.

1330
00:52:31,855 --> 00:52:32,855
Mr. Ito Kenichi.

1331
00:52:32,855 --> 00:52:34,895
(The 1st place holder will choose the numbers.)

1332
00:52:34,895 --> 00:52:35,895
Okay.

1333
00:52:38,795 --> 00:52:40,095
(Jae Seok, the oldest member, )

1334
00:52:40,095 --> 00:52:41,725
(gets number one.)

1335
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:43,395
Number one.

1336
00:52:43,655 --> 00:52:45,955
He must have recognized Jae Seok as number one.

1337
00:52:45,955 --> 00:52:48,055
Thank you.

1338
00:52:48,795 --> 00:52:50,025
(Haha with a unique haircut...)

1339
00:52:50,025 --> 00:52:51,125
Three.

1340
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:52,955
(gets number 3.)

1341
00:52:53,225 --> 00:52:54,395
That hurts my feelings.

1342
00:52:54,395 --> 00:52:56,555
You are number three in this group.

1343
00:52:56,555 --> 00:52:57,895
- Thank you. - Number two.

1344
00:52:57,895 --> 00:52:58,995
So Min is number two.

1345
00:52:58,995 --> 00:53:00,855
(So Min gets number 2.)

1346
00:53:00,855 --> 00:53:02,655
- Thank you. - Okay.

1347
00:53:02,655 --> 00:53:05,825
I will begin with number one.

1348
00:53:05,825 --> 00:53:06,855
I am excited.

1349
00:53:06,855 --> 00:53:09,355
(Jae Seok goes down the ladder of fate.)

1350
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,795
- Open. - Open.

1351
00:53:11,795 --> 00:53:13,355
Please.

1352
00:53:13,355 --> 00:53:15,455
- Maybe I will have to leave. - No way. It's number one.

1353
00:53:15,455 --> 00:53:18,055
(Will Jae Seok get to see Mr. Kenichi run?)

1354
00:53:18,055 --> 00:53:21,855
(Watch and earn a stamp)

1355
00:53:22,695 --> 00:53:25,055
(I am off to a good start.)

1356
00:53:25,055 --> 00:53:26,095
This is a disaster.

1357
00:53:26,095 --> 00:53:27,525
He will earn a stamp.

1358
00:53:27,525 --> 00:53:28,895
This is a disaster.

1359
00:53:28,895 --> 00:53:30,255
- Thank you. - This is a disaster.

1360
00:53:30,255 --> 00:53:31,295
- Haha. - Okay.

1361
00:53:32,025 --> 00:53:33,025
This is a disaster.

1362
00:53:33,025 --> 00:53:34,195
(It's Haha's turn.)

1363
00:53:35,695 --> 00:53:39,125
(Will his 3 hours of effort bear fruit?)

1364
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:41,125
(Watch, but fail to earn a stamp)

1365
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:43,295
(A slight difference in numbers changed their fate.)

1366
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:45,295
- Thank goodness. - Haha failed to earn a stamp.

1367
00:53:45,295 --> 00:53:47,995
So Min, please leave.

1368
00:53:47,995 --> 00:53:49,855
What? I want to watch him run.

1369
00:53:49,855 --> 00:53:51,925
The cameraman will watch in her place.

1370
00:53:51,925 --> 00:53:53,025
- I want to watch him run. - Please leave.

1371
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:55,025
- I was curious. - Please leave.

1372
00:53:55,025 --> 00:53:56,695
- Please give me an opportunity. - No, So Min.

1373
00:53:56,695 --> 00:53:58,025
- I can watch from afar. - Bye.

1374
00:53:58,025 --> 00:53:59,095
(She has to leave by herself.)

1375
00:53:59,095 --> 00:54:00,625
We don't have much time.

1376
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:01,995
Am I really not allowed to watch?

1377
00:54:02,055 --> 00:54:03,955
- Am I really not allowed to watch? - Please wait at the car.

1378
00:54:03,955 --> 00:54:06,595
Does that mean Si Yeon will watch?

1379
00:54:06,655 --> 00:54:09,295
So Min, we are running behind.

1380
00:54:09,295 --> 00:54:10,925
- We need to move things along. - So Min,

1381
00:54:10,925 --> 00:54:12,395
- bye. - Bye.

1382
00:54:12,395 --> 00:54:13,455
Bye.

1383
00:54:13,455 --> 00:54:15,455
- Really? - Thank you.

1384
00:54:15,825 --> 00:54:17,795
I can't believe it.

1385
00:54:18,995 --> 00:54:20,295
Am I really not allowed to watch?

1386
00:54:21,025 --> 00:54:22,025
My goodness.

1387
00:54:22,495 --> 00:54:23,495
Hold the camera.

1388
00:54:23,895 --> 00:54:25,955
- I have to go and watch him run. - My goodness.

1389
00:54:25,955 --> 00:54:27,555
(Please hold the camera so I can get a good look.)

1390
00:54:28,795 --> 00:54:30,125
Go and watch him run.

1391
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:31,855
- Go and watch him run. - I will be back.

1392
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:33,255
He is really leaving.

1393
00:54:33,455 --> 00:54:35,095
Si Yeon,

1394
00:54:35,495 --> 00:54:37,295
tell me about it later.

1395
00:54:37,925 --> 00:54:41,025
(Please enjoy it and give me a review.)

1396
00:54:41,395 --> 00:54:43,295
Now, Mr. Ito Kenichi will run.

1397
00:54:43,295 --> 00:54:45,125
Mr. Ito Kenichi usually runs 100m.

1398
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:47,195
It's too bad that this park...

1399
00:54:47,195 --> 00:54:48,325
is a bit small.

1400
00:54:48,325 --> 00:54:52,525
It must be about 20 to 30m long.

1401
00:54:56,395 --> 00:54:57,955
(Running Man Sports)

1402
00:54:58,095 --> 00:54:59,695
It's too bad...

1403
00:54:59,695 --> 00:55:01,655
that we are doing this...

1404
00:55:02,025 --> 00:55:04,655
at a playground in the residential area.

1405
00:55:05,355 --> 00:55:07,995
First, Haha will give it a try.

1406
00:55:07,995 --> 00:55:09,225
(Haha versus Ito Kenichi)

1407
00:55:10,325 --> 00:55:11,895
(Ito Kenichi)

1408
00:55:12,395 --> 00:55:15,825
(He set the world record by running 100m in 15.71 seconds.)

1409
00:55:15,825 --> 00:55:18,655
(The human cheetah, Ito Kenichi)

1410
00:55:20,195 --> 00:55:22,455
(I am confident when it comes to running on all fours.)

1411
00:55:22,455 --> 00:55:26,195
(7 years of variety shows gave Haha a lot of practice.)

1412
00:55:27,531 --> 00:55:30,571
(Who will be the 1st in the world?)

1413
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:33,825
All right. Get ready.

1414
00:55:34,963 --> 00:55:35,801
Get ready.

1415
00:55:35,801 --> 00:55:36,971
(Ito Kenichi versus Haha)

1416
00:55:37,111 --> 00:55:38,141
Start.

1417
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:41,382
(It's a competition between Ito Kenichi and Haha.)

1418
00:55:41,531 --> 00:55:44,070
He runs 100m on all fours.

1419
00:55:45,289 --> 00:55:48,649
(He calls the start of the race.)

1420
00:55:49,885 --> 00:55:52,585
(He's a wild cheetah on the hunt.)

1421
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:55,880
(He's the fastest in the world.)

1422
00:55:56,857 --> 00:55:59,687
(He's mesmerized by the cheetah.)

1423
00:56:04,258 --> 00:56:05,288
Start.

1424
00:56:06,218 --> 00:56:08,318
(He falls over.)

1425
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:10,718
(He couldn't resist the gravity.)

1426
00:56:13,288 --> 00:56:14,788
(Embarrassed)

1427
00:56:15,888 --> 00:56:17,258
He's very fast.

1428
00:56:17,258 --> 00:56:18,388
(The race seems pointless.)

1429
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:21,158
It's not easy to move on all fours.

1430
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:23,118
Right.

1431
00:56:23,518 --> 00:56:25,618
(He moves awkwardly.)

1432
00:56:25,618 --> 00:56:26,918
You're going sideways.

1433
00:56:27,318 --> 00:56:29,518
- It's hard. - I thought you were a crab.

1434
00:56:29,518 --> 00:56:31,518
(I thought you were a crab.)

1435
00:56:33,188 --> 00:56:34,658
You looked like a crab.

1436
00:56:35,288 --> 00:56:37,158
- Crabs are in season soon. - Right.

1437
00:56:37,418 --> 00:56:39,718
Thank you again, Ito.

1438
00:56:39,718 --> 00:56:41,088
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1439
00:56:41,088 --> 00:56:42,558
Thank you.

1440
00:56:42,558 --> 00:56:43,758
Thank you.

1441
00:56:44,618 --> 00:56:47,818
Now that I'm carrying the camera,

1442
00:56:48,618 --> 00:56:51,088
I understand the pressure Si Yeon must feel.

1443
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:54,858
It must've been hard to carry it at the Labyrinth yesterday.

1444
00:56:55,658 --> 00:56:57,158
I bet it looked like this.

1445
00:56:57,158 --> 00:56:59,888
(I bet it looked like this.)

1446
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:03,718
(She's playful even when she's alone.)

1447
00:57:06,818 --> 00:57:07,818
Shall I take a peek?

1448
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:11,188
Shall I take a peek? I think I can see him from here.

1449
00:57:11,388 --> 00:57:12,388
I see him.

1450
00:57:14,218 --> 00:57:16,818
(She decides to zoom in with the camera.)

1451
00:57:16,818 --> 00:57:18,258
I see the camera director.

1452
00:57:18,418 --> 00:57:19,418
He's running.

1453
00:57:19,988 --> 00:57:21,858
You can see him by zooming in.

1454
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:24,988
I couldn't see him. When he leans forward...

1455
00:57:25,158 --> 00:57:27,418
to run on all fours, I can't see him.

1456
00:57:28,288 --> 00:57:30,918
I only saw a part of his buttocks.

1457
00:57:30,918 --> 00:57:31,918
(She's disappointed.)

1458
00:57:32,888 --> 00:57:34,188
You're working hard.

1459
00:57:35,988 --> 00:57:37,718
This place looks pretty.

1460
00:57:37,718 --> 00:57:39,258
(Si Yeon comes back.)

1461
00:57:39,258 --> 00:57:41,518
You're back, Si Yeon. Did you see him?

1462
00:57:41,618 --> 00:57:42,888
- Tell me. - I only saw him run.

1463
00:57:42,888 --> 00:57:43,988
Did you see him?

1464
00:57:43,988 --> 00:57:47,058
Tell me what you think. How did he run?

1465
00:57:47,158 --> 00:57:48,718
He ran very quickly on all fours like a monkey.

1466
00:57:48,718 --> 00:57:49,818
Was he very fast?

1467
00:57:49,888 --> 00:57:51,988
Do his hands and feet move separately?

1468
00:57:51,988 --> 00:57:54,318
- Or do the hands move together? - Hands move together.

1469
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:55,518
Is it really surprising?

1470
00:57:55,518 --> 00:57:56,558
Yes, it's surprising.

1471
00:57:57,788 --> 00:57:58,818
I see.

1472
00:57:58,818 --> 00:57:59,918
Give me the camera.

1473
00:58:00,818 --> 00:58:01,818
Thank you.

1474
00:58:01,818 --> 00:58:02,888
(Her film shoot ends.)

1475
00:58:02,888 --> 00:58:04,788
- The camera is quite heavy. - Yes.

1476
00:58:05,088 --> 00:58:06,218
It's very heavy.

1477
00:58:07,188 --> 00:58:08,718
In the end, I couldn't see him.

1478
00:58:10,918 --> 00:58:12,418
(She gives it a try.)

1479
00:58:12,418 --> 00:58:14,658
Was this how he did it?

1480
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:15,658
(We hope she won't be exempt next time.)

1481
00:58:16,358 --> 00:58:19,058
By the way, we're running very late.

1482
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:22,258
Will we be able to get another stamp?

1483
00:58:22,258 --> 00:58:24,388
Let's go to the pork cutlet restaurant now.

1484
00:58:25,158 --> 00:58:27,718
Pork cutlet will make me feel better.

1485
00:58:28,288 --> 00:58:30,388
The way it's served...

1486
00:58:30,388 --> 00:58:32,088
- looks very delicious. - Really?

1487
00:58:32,088 --> 00:58:33,188
It looks classic.

1488
00:58:34,988 --> 00:58:38,218
(It's simple and made without artificial flavoring.)

1489
00:58:38,218 --> 00:58:41,258
(The restaurant made classic pork cutlet for 122 years.)

1490
00:58:41,988 --> 00:58:44,658
We must be together no matter what.

1491
00:58:46,918 --> 00:58:48,088
Why aren't you responding?

1492
00:58:48,088 --> 00:58:49,188
(Why are you silent?)

1493
00:58:49,188 --> 00:58:52,988
I was wondering if that would be necessary.

1494
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:55,518
I prefer to play separately.

1495
00:58:55,518 --> 00:58:56,618
(She wants to play individually.)

1496
00:58:56,618 --> 00:58:58,618
It's possible to have that opinion.

1497
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,918
You may not be aware, but I'm very lucky today.

1498
00:59:01,988 --> 00:59:04,118
I have a good feeling.

1499
00:59:04,218 --> 00:59:06,888
You may want to play separately, but...

1500
00:59:07,518 --> 00:59:09,788
Let's wait and see if that feeling is unlucky.

1501
00:59:09,788 --> 00:59:10,818
Unlucky?

1502
00:59:11,418 --> 00:59:13,418
How could you say that?

1503
00:59:13,418 --> 00:59:15,618
- Let's see what happens. - Okay.

1504
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:16,658
- So Min. - Yes?

1505
00:59:16,658 --> 00:59:18,988
If we agree on playing together, we'll stay together.

1506
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:21,088
If we agree on playing separately, we'll be separate.

1507
00:59:21,818 --> 00:59:23,158
- I see. - Okay.

1508
00:59:23,158 --> 00:59:24,188
Okay.

1509
00:59:24,558 --> 00:59:26,318
Try to convince me.

1510
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:29,518
(In that case, try to convince me.)

1511
00:59:29,518 --> 00:59:31,658
- What are you talking about? - No way.

1512
00:59:31,658 --> 00:59:33,718
- We're still a team. - What's wrong with you?

1513
00:59:33,718 --> 00:59:36,988
Convince you? What are you talking about?

1514
00:59:36,988 --> 00:59:38,188
"Is it together or separate?"

1515
00:59:38,188 --> 00:59:39,888
- "Convince me." - I can't believe this.

1516
00:59:39,918 --> 00:59:41,358
That makes a good title.

1517
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:42,918
It has a ring to it. What is it?

1518
00:59:42,918 --> 00:59:45,258
"Is it together or separate? Convince me."

1519
00:59:45,258 --> 00:59:46,258
(It's a segment within a segment.)

1520
00:59:46,258 --> 00:59:47,358
"Convince me."

1521
00:59:47,658 --> 00:59:48,918
- So Min. - Yes?

1522
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,758
Don't be sly again.

1523
00:59:50,758 --> 00:59:52,588
- Share your ideas. - Do some research.

1524
00:59:52,888 --> 00:59:55,558
I found the oldest cafe...

1525
00:59:55,918 --> 00:59:58,418
in Tokyo that still exists.

1526
00:59:58,418 --> 00:59:59,988
- I found it. - We should go there.

1527
00:59:59,988 --> 01:00:02,088
- You know this cafe? - Let's go there.

1528
01:00:02,088 --> 01:00:03,358
- We should go there. - That sounds great.

1529
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:05,258
- Let's go there. - This cafe became famous...

1530
01:00:05,258 --> 01:00:07,718
after John Lennon and Yoko Ono's visit.

1531
01:00:07,718 --> 01:00:09,358
- Really? - That's great.

1532
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:12,388
So Min who lives in Neunggok...

1533
01:00:12,388 --> 01:00:13,458
would love it.

1534
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:14,788
She's the first in Korea.

1535
01:00:14,788 --> 01:00:16,988
She's an actress from Neunggok.

1536
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:20,118
She's a silly woman from Neunggok.

1537
01:00:20,118 --> 01:00:21,818
(How dare you?)

1538
01:00:22,758 --> 01:00:24,918
("Silly Woman" by Haha)

1539
01:00:24,918 --> 01:00:27,758
You should stop singing old songs.

1540
01:00:28,218 --> 01:00:31,288
You always sing old songs.

1541
01:00:31,288 --> 01:00:32,288
(He became an old man.)

1542
01:00:32,918 --> 01:00:35,158
(He sings a recent song.)

1543
01:00:35,158 --> 01:00:37,118
- What? - Stay quiet if you don't know.

1544
01:00:37,518 --> 01:00:38,988
Just stay quiet.

1545
01:00:39,458 --> 01:00:41,318
Is this it? Let's go.

1546
01:00:41,318 --> 01:00:42,518
Let's get out.

1547
01:00:43,988 --> 01:00:45,688
- We're getting out. - Take it.

1548
01:00:46,618 --> 01:00:47,718
Thank you.

1549
01:00:47,718 --> 01:00:49,318
- Where is it? - Is it here?

1550
01:00:49,558 --> 01:00:50,558
Where is it?

1551
01:00:50,558 --> 01:00:53,288
(It's the world's best pork cutlet restaurant that opened in 1895.)

1552
01:00:53,288 --> 01:00:58,788
(With 122 years of history, the restaurant's pork cutlet is light.)

1553
01:00:59,858 --> 01:01:01,988
- Before you go in... - We don't have time.

1554
01:01:01,988 --> 01:01:02,988
All right.

1555
01:01:03,188 --> 01:01:05,118
Will you be together?

1556
01:01:05,118 --> 01:01:06,518
- Separate. - Separate.

1557
01:01:08,188 --> 01:01:09,218
(What did you say?)

1558
01:01:09,218 --> 01:01:10,288
- Will you be separate? - Yes.

1559
01:01:10,288 --> 01:01:12,388
- That's cruel. - We have to keep researching.

1560
01:01:12,388 --> 01:01:14,518
Fine, we'll be separate.

1561
01:01:14,818 --> 01:01:17,158
One is eating pork cutlet and getting a stamp.

1562
01:01:17,258 --> 01:01:19,118
One is eating pork cutlet without a stamp.

1563
01:01:19,118 --> 01:01:20,518
- I want to place second. - One is not eating.

1564
01:01:20,518 --> 01:01:22,388
One is not eating without a stamp.

1565
01:01:22,388 --> 01:01:23,988
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1566
01:01:23,988 --> 01:01:25,358
Rock-paper-scissors.

1567
01:01:25,358 --> 01:01:26,388
Okay.

1568
01:01:26,888 --> 01:01:27,888
We could have been together.

1569
01:01:27,888 --> 01:01:28,918
I don't want to.

1570
01:01:29,658 --> 01:01:30,818
- Number 2. - Number 2.

1571
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:32,718
Just go home.

1572
01:01:33,818 --> 01:01:36,618
(Haha gets to eat without a stamp.)

1573
01:01:37,818 --> 01:01:40,258
You get to eat but will not get a stamp.

1574
01:01:40,258 --> 01:01:41,758
1 of the 2 is the worst.

1575
01:01:42,618 --> 01:01:43,888
What if I don't get to eat?

1576
01:01:43,888 --> 01:01:45,088
I choose number one.

1577
01:01:45,088 --> 01:01:46,118
- Number one? - Yes.

1578
01:01:46,718 --> 01:01:48,418
Goodbye, So Min.

1579
01:01:48,418 --> 01:01:52,418
(Will So Min get lucky or not?)

1580
01:01:52,418 --> 01:01:55,618
(Who will get lucky on the ladder?)

1581
01:01:56,818 --> 01:01:59,618
(She neither gets to eat nor gets a stamp.)

1582
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:01,718
(Is it because Kwang Soo isn't here?)

1583
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,718
- That's incredible. - It's because Kwang Soo isn't here.

1584
01:02:04,718 --> 01:02:05,718
(So Min gets very unlucky.)

1585
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:10,518
(She misses him. Are you well, Kwang Soo?)

1586
01:02:10,988 --> 01:02:12,418
I'm leaving.

1587
01:02:13,288 --> 01:02:14,988
- Where are you going? - Haha...

1588
01:02:14,988 --> 01:02:16,818
and Jae Seok will go eat.

1589
01:02:16,818 --> 01:02:18,518
I think...

1590
01:02:18,518 --> 01:02:20,718
I'm very lucky today.

1591
01:02:20,718 --> 01:02:22,258
It's a sad reality.

1592
01:02:22,258 --> 01:02:25,088
(What's wrong with me today?)

1593
01:02:26,118 --> 01:02:27,118
My goodness.

1594
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,618
(They enter the best pork cutlet restaurant.)

1595
01:02:29,658 --> 01:02:32,918
The way you punch in the numbers in the calculator...

1596
01:02:32,918 --> 01:02:34,758
- Is it like a typewriter? - Yes.

1597
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:37,258
(He decides to ask the owner.)

1598
01:02:37,258 --> 01:02:38,718
Is this the first restaurant?

1599
01:02:38,958 --> 01:02:40,058
That's right.

1600
01:02:41,118 --> 01:02:47,818
(Started as a French restaurant, it made the world's first pork cutlet.)

1601
01:02:47,818 --> 01:02:49,388
French cuisine?

1602
01:02:49,388 --> 01:02:51,988
(It became famous as a pork cutlet restaurant.)

1603
01:02:53,158 --> 01:02:55,858
It's an honor to be here. I love pork cutlet.

1604
01:02:56,718 --> 01:02:58,088
(How will it taste?)

1605
01:02:58,088 --> 01:02:59,488
Thank you very much.

1606
01:02:59,518 --> 01:03:00,988
It looks very simple.

1607
01:03:01,388 --> 01:03:04,788
(Pork cutlet is served only with cabbage and without any sauce.)

1608
01:03:04,788 --> 01:03:05,788
This is...

1609
01:03:05,788 --> 01:03:08,158
(It's the most classic pork cutlet.)

1610
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:11,088
Look at how juicy the meat is.

1611
01:03:11,818 --> 01:03:12,818
Look.

1612
01:03:13,418 --> 01:03:15,988
- It's the first pork cutlet. - I need some mustard.

1613
01:03:15,988 --> 01:03:18,088
(So Min watches them eat.)

1614
01:03:18,358 --> 01:03:19,488
The meat is different.

1615
01:03:19,718 --> 01:03:21,158
(It's thick.)

1616
01:03:21,158 --> 01:03:24,518
It's very meaty.

1617
01:03:24,518 --> 01:03:25,558
It's soy sauce.

1618
01:03:25,588 --> 01:03:27,118
(He takes a big bite.)

1619
01:03:28,518 --> 01:03:30,618
(The best, nutty flavor spreads inside his mouth.)

1620
01:03:30,618 --> 01:03:32,218
I couldn't watch Ito Kenichi run.

1621
01:03:32,218 --> 01:03:33,318
I can't eat either.

1622
01:03:33,318 --> 01:03:34,318
It's so delicious, So Min.

1623
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:36,388
It's good without any sauce.

1624
01:03:37,158 --> 01:03:38,988
(She stares at the food.)

1625
01:03:38,988 --> 01:03:40,318
Give me one bite.

1626
01:03:41,258 --> 01:03:42,458
- I want to. - Give me one bite.

1627
01:03:42,458 --> 01:03:43,918
I really want to.

1628
01:03:44,258 --> 01:03:45,288
It's so delicious.

1629
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:46,988
How about...

1630
01:03:46,988 --> 01:03:53,218
(How about we tease So Min whose mouth is watering?)

1631
01:03:53,218 --> 01:03:54,988
(She reaches for it.)

1632
01:03:55,618 --> 01:03:57,188
(She falls for Jae Seok's trick.)

1633
01:03:57,188 --> 01:03:59,288
- What are you doing? - Weren't you giving it to me?

1634
01:03:59,318 --> 01:04:00,318
I thought you were.

1635
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:02,188
I was about to eat it.

1636
01:04:02,258 --> 01:04:03,718
Why did you try to eat it?

1637
01:04:03,718 --> 01:04:04,918
I didn't know.

1638
01:04:04,918 --> 01:04:05,988
I thought you were giving it to me.

1639
01:04:05,988 --> 01:04:07,788
(She reaches for it again.)

1640
01:04:08,158 --> 01:04:09,988
What are you doing?

1641
01:04:10,218 --> 01:04:11,388
I thought you were feeding me.

1642
01:04:11,388 --> 01:04:12,958
It's really delicious.

1643
01:04:13,158 --> 01:04:14,618
(Give me one bite.)

1644
01:04:14,618 --> 01:04:16,288
What are you doing?

1645
01:04:16,518 --> 01:04:18,188
What are you doing?

1646
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:19,188
(I'll eat 100 pork cutlet in Korea.)

1647
01:04:19,558 --> 01:04:21,118
- Hurry and eat. - I finished.

1648
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:23,258
We should hurry. Where's the cafe?

1649
01:04:23,258 --> 01:04:24,818
I think it's nearby.

1650
01:04:24,818 --> 01:04:25,988
- Really? - Let's run.

1651
01:04:25,988 --> 01:04:27,488
- Let's go now. - Okay.

1652
01:04:27,988 --> 01:04:29,788
Where's the cafe?

1653
01:04:29,788 --> 01:04:31,418
It's called Paulista.

1654
01:04:31,818 --> 01:04:34,258
Other than the cafe, we have one more place to go.

1655
01:04:34,388 --> 01:04:36,158
We're running late.

1656
01:04:36,388 --> 01:04:37,518
(Some are lost near Mount Fuji.)

1657
01:04:37,518 --> 01:04:39,758
Okay, let's go.

1658
01:04:40,388 --> 01:04:42,358
- Let's go, Seok Jin. - Ji Hyo.

1659
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:44,958
There's a place called Wakuike.

1660
01:04:45,218 --> 01:04:46,318
A lot of water runs here.

1661
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:47,618
There are many bodies of water,

1662
01:04:47,618 --> 01:04:49,288
- but it has the most water. - Let's go there.

1663
01:04:49,288 --> 01:04:51,418
We should tell them because it's the first place.

1664
01:04:51,418 --> 01:04:52,418
It's the top.

1665
01:04:52,418 --> 01:04:56,618
(Wakuike is a lake in Oshino located at the bottom of Mount Fuji.)

1666
01:04:56,618 --> 01:05:01,188
(With the most amount of water, it's registered as a natural monument.)

1667
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:05,818
(Drinking water from this legendary lake brings you luck.)

1668
01:05:06,258 --> 01:05:12,658
(The lake springs the most amount of water due to permanent snow.)

1669
01:05:13,158 --> 01:05:16,188
Will you be together or separate?

1670
01:05:16,288 --> 01:05:17,718
The same rule applies.

1671
01:05:17,718 --> 01:05:18,988
- This time, - Let's be together.

1672
01:05:18,988 --> 01:05:20,918
- we're here... - Together?

1673
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:22,518
Already.

1674
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:23,918
Let's drink water together.

1675
01:05:23,918 --> 01:05:24,918
Be together?

1676
01:05:24,918 --> 01:05:26,188
In 1, 2, 3.

1677
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:27,218
- Together. - Together.

1678
01:05:27,218 --> 01:05:29,658
We'll spin the roulette.

1679
01:05:29,658 --> 01:05:31,658
- "Doing it for one stamp". - "Doing it for one stamp".

1680
01:05:31,888 --> 01:05:33,788
- No activity and no stamp. - No stamp.

1681
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,458
- There are two options. - It's 50-50.

1682
01:05:35,518 --> 01:05:40,118
Now that we're here, we should drink the water from the mountain.

1683
01:05:40,118 --> 01:05:43,158
If you end up not doing the activity,

1684
01:05:43,158 --> 01:05:44,958
only the cameramen will wash their hands.

1685
01:05:44,958 --> 01:05:47,158
(Only the cameramen will wash their hands.)

1686
01:05:47,758 --> 01:05:50,988
We will wash our hands too.

1687
01:05:51,188 --> 01:05:52,588
We will do it.

1688
01:05:54,358 --> 01:05:55,418
Please.

1689
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:57,418
(With a 50-percent chance, they will get to wash their hands.)

1690
01:05:57,418 --> 01:06:00,788
(With a 50-percent chance, only the others will benefit.)

1691
01:06:01,418 --> 01:06:04,988
(What result will they get together?)

1692
01:06:04,988 --> 01:06:08,418
(They will do the activity and get a stamp.)

1693
01:06:09,088 --> 01:06:10,188
- Yes! - Yes!

1694
01:06:10,188 --> 01:06:11,418
(What is going on?)

1695
01:06:11,418 --> 01:06:13,318
We should of course try the water.

1696
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:15,088
- Of course. And wash our hands. - We'll wash our hands too.

1697
01:06:15,258 --> 01:06:17,788
The water is from Mount Fuji.

1698
01:06:17,788 --> 01:06:20,288
- When will we get to try it again? - Exactly.

1699
01:06:20,818 --> 01:06:24,058
Then drink the water and wash your hands.

1700
01:06:24,058 --> 01:06:25,988
- You'll also get a stamp. - Okay.

1701
01:06:25,988 --> 01:06:28,158
The staff members should wash their hands too.

1702
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:30,758
I'm getting excited.

1703
01:06:30,758 --> 01:06:32,688
We have to hold out for 30 seconds.

1704
01:06:32,718 --> 01:06:34,458
- Hold? - One...

1705
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:35,918
Can you keep track of time?

1706
01:06:35,918 --> 01:06:37,258
(Having your hands in the water for 30 seconds brings good luck.)

1707
01:06:37,258 --> 01:06:39,358
1, 2, 3.

1708
01:06:39,788 --> 01:06:42,758
(The cold hits.)

1709
01:06:42,758 --> 01:06:43,918
1, 2, 3.

1710
01:06:43,918 --> 01:06:45,758
(Their hands are freezing.)

1711
01:06:45,758 --> 01:06:46,918
It's so cold.

1712
01:06:47,258 --> 01:06:48,458
It's ice cold.

1713
01:06:48,458 --> 01:06:50,318
It's unbelievable.

1714
01:06:50,818 --> 01:06:52,918
It's 27°C to 28°C outside.

1715
01:06:53,388 --> 01:06:54,988
Let's win the game today.

1716
01:06:54,988 --> 01:06:56,618
(Let's win the game.)

1717
01:06:57,718 --> 01:06:58,788
Like this?

1718
01:06:58,788 --> 01:07:00,858
(They drink the water too.)

1719
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:02,088
It's so cold.

1720
01:07:02,088 --> 01:07:05,118
(This is why people love to drink permanent snow.)

1721
01:07:06,688 --> 01:07:09,058
Will I have a second child?

1722
01:07:09,388 --> 01:07:11,518
Will this water give me a second child?

1723
01:07:11,518 --> 01:07:12,518
(The permanent snow makes you plan for a second child.)

1724
01:07:12,518 --> 01:07:14,258
- Seok Jin, good luck. - Seok Jin.

1725
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:17,188
- I'll have a second child. - Good luck.

1726
01:07:19,718 --> 01:07:21,358
I'll have a second child.

1727
01:07:21,988 --> 01:07:23,418
- We rode the rollercoaster. - We did.

1728
01:07:23,418 --> 01:07:25,318
We washed our hands with the glacier water.

1729
01:07:25,318 --> 01:07:27,158
Now...

1730
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:29,758
- Let's go for some sushi. - Sushi?

1731
01:07:30,058 --> 01:07:32,888
Okay. Find a famous place.

1732
01:07:32,888 --> 01:07:34,128
Find the number-one place.

1733
01:07:34,658 --> 01:07:37,758
Since our theme is to find first places,

1734
01:07:38,188 --> 01:07:40,588
we have to visit the best sushi place in Japan.

1735
01:07:40,688 --> 01:07:44,058
I saw a place with Michelin stars.

1736
01:07:44,058 --> 01:07:45,188
- A sushi place? - Yes.

1737
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:49,088
They won 2 Michelin stars for 4 years in a row.

1738
01:07:50,518 --> 01:07:53,058
I'd love to try that place. Will we be able to go there?

1739
01:07:53,058 --> 01:07:55,258
- This place looks amazing. - We might have to wait.

1740
01:07:55,628 --> 01:07:59,858
(It's a sushi restaurant owned by a sushi master, Ono Jiro.)

1741
01:07:59,858 --> 01:08:04,318
(He is the oldest chef with 3 Michelin stars.)

1742
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:06,888
(Seok Jin is searching too.)

1743
01:08:06,888 --> 01:08:08,858
- We should... - Hey.

1744
01:08:08,858 --> 01:08:10,128
Amazing. Hold on.

1745
01:08:10,488 --> 01:08:12,288
There is the world's first red bean bread place.

1746
01:08:12,958 --> 01:08:15,518
- The world's first. - I saw that place yesterday.

1747
01:08:15,518 --> 01:08:16,888
It opened in 1875.

1748
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:19,758
We'll go to the sushi place first.

1749
01:08:19,758 --> 01:08:21,588
- If we fail... - If we fail, we'll go to...

1750
01:08:21,588 --> 01:08:22,918
- the bakery. - We'll go to the bakery.

1751
01:08:22,918 --> 01:08:25,518
- We don't have much time left. - We don't.

1752
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:26,588
(They have about 4 hours left.)

1753
01:08:26,588 --> 01:08:28,758
Sir, please...

1754
01:08:28,758 --> 01:08:30,318
go to Tokyo.

1755
01:08:30,318 --> 01:08:31,818
- We are going there. - We are going there.

1756
01:08:31,818 --> 01:08:33,628
Please go to Tokyo.

1757
01:08:33,628 --> 01:08:35,288
(We're already on our way there.)

1758
01:08:35,288 --> 01:08:36,518
Tokyo.

1759
01:08:36,518 --> 01:08:38,558
You've seen the signs.

1760
01:08:38,558 --> 01:08:40,718
Why do you say that?

1761
01:08:40,718 --> 01:08:42,718
I love Tokyo.

1762
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:44,858
(We've been heading to Tokyo since morning.)

1763
01:08:44,858 --> 01:08:46,358
We finally get to see buildings.

1764
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:48,288
(After 2 hours, they finally arrive.)

1765
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:52,918
I think we can have the red bean bread.

1766
01:08:52,918 --> 01:08:55,158
But the sushi place closes at 2pm.

1767
01:08:55,258 --> 01:08:57,158
- At 2pm? - Yes. What time is it now?

1768
01:08:57,158 --> 01:08:58,488
It's 1:50pm.

1769
01:08:58,988 --> 01:09:00,458
- Gosh. - That's a problem.

1770
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:01,788
We might not make it.

1771
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:03,128
- Can we pull up here? - You have to run.

1772
01:09:03,128 --> 01:09:04,458
Okay. Let's run.

1773
01:09:04,458 --> 01:09:06,128
(They arrive at the sushi place 5 minutes before the closing time.)

1774
01:09:06,128 --> 01:09:07,318
We don't have much time.

1775
01:09:07,418 --> 01:09:08,458
Let's run.

1776
01:09:08,588 --> 01:09:10,488
- Turn right. - Turn right.

1777
01:09:10,488 --> 01:09:11,628
Turn right.

1778
01:09:11,958 --> 01:09:13,588
It's there.

1779
01:09:13,588 --> 01:09:15,718
(Seok Jin: 2 stamps, Ji Hyo: 2 stamps, Se Chan: 1 stamp)

1780
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:17,258
Time is running out.

1781
01:09:17,788 --> 01:09:18,858
What time is it now?

1782
01:09:18,858 --> 01:09:20,218
(They have to get there within 2 minutes.)

1783
01:09:20,218 --> 01:09:22,518
- It's 1:57pm. - It's 1:57pm.

1784
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:24,128
Where is the place?

1785
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:26,388
It's here.

1786
01:09:26,388 --> 01:09:28,128
(Will they get to try the sushi and win stamps?)

1787
01:09:28,128 --> 01:09:29,818
Is this the place? Excuse me.

1788
01:09:29,818 --> 01:09:32,258
Is it closed?

1789
01:09:32,258 --> 01:09:33,358
- No sushi? - No sushi.

1790
01:09:33,358 --> 01:09:34,988
- I'm hungry. - No.

1791
01:09:35,188 --> 01:09:37,988
I want this sushi. I like this sushi.

1792
01:09:37,988 --> 01:09:40,188
We're already closed for today.

1793
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:44,558
(We're closed.)

1794
01:09:44,818 --> 01:09:48,058
- Come back another time for dinner. - Dinner?

1795
01:09:48,058 --> 01:09:50,058
What time do you open?

1796
01:09:50,058 --> 01:09:51,788
From 5:30pm.

1797
01:09:51,788 --> 01:09:53,218
- Oh, my gosh. - 5:30pm?

1798
01:09:53,488 --> 01:09:54,688
Is that so?

1799
01:09:54,688 --> 01:09:56,358
You have to make a reservation.

1800
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:57,818
- A reservation? - What about...

1801
01:09:57,818 --> 01:09:59,818
- What about takeout? - No takeout.

1802
01:09:59,818 --> 01:10:01,588
- No takeout? - No takeout.

1803
01:10:01,588 --> 01:10:02,858
No takeout.

1804
01:10:03,318 --> 01:10:06,358
- We're going back to Seoul today. - To Seoul?

1805
01:10:06,358 --> 01:10:07,818
- Please. - Bye-bye.

1806
01:10:08,688 --> 01:10:11,988
(Bye-bye)

1807
01:10:12,628 --> 01:10:14,788
- Let's have red bean bread. - Let's run.

1808
01:10:15,058 --> 01:10:16,858
We have to get there before the other team does.

1809
01:10:17,158 --> 01:10:19,318
Let's try the world's first red bean bread place.

1810
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:22,258
- Are we going to the bakery? - Finally...

1811
01:10:22,258 --> 01:10:23,958
- That looks tasty. - That looks tasty.

1812
01:10:24,318 --> 01:10:25,588
Can't we get one?

1813
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:27,058
We don't have much time.

1814
01:10:27,058 --> 01:10:28,558
- Let's try one. - We don't have time.

1815
01:10:28,788 --> 01:10:29,888
Lead the way. Where is the place?

1816
01:10:29,888 --> 01:10:32,518
(They're on their way to the world's first red bean bread place.)

1817
01:10:32,518 --> 01:10:35,958
- It's here. - Where?

1818
01:10:35,958 --> 01:10:39,358
(The place sure looks old.)

1819
01:10:40,258 --> 01:10:41,918
- It's here. - It's here.

1820
01:10:41,918 --> 01:10:44,418
(This red bean bread place opened in 1869.)

1821
01:10:44,418 --> 01:10:48,658
(They invented red bean bread in 1874.)

1822
01:10:49,058 --> 01:10:50,288
(What will they choose this time?)

1823
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:51,588
- Sorry? - Right.

1824
01:10:51,588 --> 01:10:52,658
- We have to make a choice. - What choice?

1825
01:10:52,658 --> 01:10:54,258
Together or separate?

1826
01:10:54,258 --> 01:10:55,988
- Here? - We have to choose "separate".

1827
01:10:55,988 --> 01:10:57,128
We choose "separate".

1828
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:58,518
1, 2, 3.

1829
01:10:58,518 --> 01:10:59,588
- Separate. - Separate.

1830
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:01,688
(Team Ji Hyo chooses "separate".)

1831
01:11:01,688 --> 01:11:02,888
- I choose number 3. - Number 3.

1832
01:11:02,888 --> 01:11:03,958
I choose number one.

1833
01:11:05,088 --> 01:11:06,358
Here we go.

1834
01:11:07,518 --> 01:11:08,658
I'm getting nervous.

1835
01:11:08,658 --> 01:11:10,258
(Will Ji Hyo stay in 1st place?)

1836
01:11:10,258 --> 01:11:11,918
Let's see. It's an X.

1837
01:11:11,918 --> 01:11:13,888
- It's an X. - You get no stamp.

1838
01:11:13,888 --> 01:11:16,518
(No stamp and no bread)

1839
01:11:16,518 --> 01:11:17,958
- Yes! - Yes!

1840
01:11:18,588 --> 01:11:21,128
- You can wait here. - You can wait here.

1841
01:11:21,128 --> 01:11:22,918
(Enjoy your bread.)

1842
01:11:23,518 --> 01:11:25,158
(It's Se Chan's turn.)

1843
01:11:25,158 --> 01:11:26,218
It's my turn.

1844
01:11:26,218 --> 01:11:27,628
- I get the bread. - You get the bread.

1845
01:11:27,628 --> 01:11:30,788
- And a stamp. - And a stamp. Yes!

1846
01:11:30,788 --> 01:11:33,058
Then we'll be tied.

1847
01:11:33,058 --> 01:11:35,318
(Seok Jin and Se Chan will get to try the bread.)

1848
01:11:36,318 --> 01:11:39,058
(I want to swear at them.)

1849
01:11:39,218 --> 01:11:42,058
- Let's try the red bean bread - Hurry.

1850
01:11:42,058 --> 01:11:44,318
- I wish Seok Jin didn't get one. - Wait here.

1851
01:11:44,518 --> 01:11:46,558
It's okay, Ji Hyo.

1852
01:11:46,818 --> 01:11:49,518
- Wait here. - Finally.

1853
01:11:50,788 --> 01:11:51,958
Let's go in.

1854
01:11:52,318 --> 01:11:53,558
That was close.

1855
01:11:53,558 --> 01:11:54,888
(They enter the bakery after dancing.)

1856
01:11:54,888 --> 01:11:56,988
(It's crowded.)

1857
01:11:58,518 --> 01:11:59,888
- Excuse me. - Excuse me.

1858
01:11:59,888 --> 01:12:00,888
(They look tasty.)

1859
01:12:01,518 --> 01:12:02,688
Two of those.

1860
01:12:03,128 --> 01:12:05,218
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1861
01:12:05,218 --> 01:12:06,458
(They order in Korean.)

1862
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:08,628
This too...

1863
01:12:10,858 --> 01:12:11,958
Look at Ji Hyo.

1864
01:12:13,388 --> 01:12:17,458
(Do you guys know how I feel?)

1865
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,058
(I'm watching you eat the world's first red bean bread.)

1866
01:12:19,058 --> 01:12:21,318
You want some, right?

1867
01:12:21,318 --> 01:12:23,388
(I'm watching you eat the world's first read bean bread.)

1868
01:12:23,718 --> 01:12:27,188
I wish Seok Jin didn't get any bread.

1869
01:12:27,188 --> 01:12:29,128
(His bread should have been mine.)

1870
01:12:29,128 --> 01:12:30,318
Let's try them.

1871
01:12:30,318 --> 01:12:31,388
(They try the bread right away.)

1872
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:32,688
It smells so good.

1873
01:12:33,958 --> 01:12:35,088
It smells so good.

1874
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:36,858
(Teasing)

1875
01:12:36,858 --> 01:12:37,958
It smells so good.

1876
01:12:38,418 --> 01:12:41,418
(Let me taste the red bean paste.)

1877
01:12:42,288 --> 01:12:43,688
It has a history of 148 years.

1878
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:45,518
You don't get any.

1879
01:12:46,958 --> 01:12:47,988
Let's hurry.

1880
01:12:48,758 --> 01:12:50,358
- This tastes amazing. - What is this?

1881
01:12:52,288 --> 01:12:54,818
(Let me at least touch it.)

1882
01:12:54,818 --> 01:12:56,858
It has sticky rice in it. Look at this.

1883
01:12:57,518 --> 01:12:59,088
(Ji Hyo puts it in her mouth.)

1884
01:12:59,088 --> 01:13:00,358
- Hey. - Ji Hyo.

1885
01:13:00,588 --> 01:13:02,388
It's not red bean bread!

1886
01:13:03,358 --> 01:13:05,658
(Ji Hyo eats the bread!)

1887
01:13:05,718 --> 01:13:07,218
- Hey. - Here.

1888
01:13:07,218 --> 01:13:08,518
(Spit it out right now.)

1889
01:13:08,518 --> 01:13:09,518
You can have one.

1890
01:13:10,318 --> 01:13:11,658
My goodness.

1891
01:13:11,918 --> 01:13:14,458
- It's not red bean bread. - It's not.

1892
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:15,628
(Ji Hyo swallowed the sticky rice bread right away.)

1893
01:13:18,218 --> 01:13:19,518
What is this street called again?

1894
01:13:19,518 --> 01:13:21,128
- Harajuku. - Harajuku.

1895
01:13:21,358 --> 01:13:23,758
- I haven't been here in forever. - Same.

1896
01:13:24,518 --> 01:13:25,518
(30 minutes ago)

1897
01:13:25,518 --> 01:13:27,488
- It's not so crowded. - Right?

1898
01:13:27,958 --> 01:13:30,658
There's a crepe street in Harajuku.

1899
01:13:30,888 --> 01:13:33,318
Why don't we find the oldest place?

1900
01:13:33,318 --> 01:13:34,758
The oldest crepe place.

1901
01:13:35,988 --> 01:13:37,088
Let's do this.

1902
01:13:37,758 --> 01:13:38,988
Yes!

1903
01:13:38,988 --> 01:13:40,758
I haven't been here in forever.

1904
01:13:40,758 --> 01:13:41,788
(They look for the oldest crepe place.)

1905
01:13:43,088 --> 01:13:45,358
(It's a street of youth.)

1906
01:13:45,358 --> 01:13:47,758
After the crepe place...

1907
01:13:48,128 --> 01:13:50,088
- I think we can find a lot here. - Right?

1908
01:13:50,088 --> 01:13:53,058
(The street is full of pretty accessories and good food.)

1909
01:13:53,058 --> 01:13:54,518
Is that something else?

1910
01:13:55,788 --> 01:13:56,858
It is.

1911
01:13:57,058 --> 01:13:59,358
It's hard to find the oldest place.

1912
01:13:59,758 --> 01:14:00,788
It's harder than I expected.

1913
01:14:01,188 --> 01:14:02,588
"Is this the oldest place?"

1914
01:14:02,588 --> 01:14:03,858
"Is this the oldest place?"

1915
01:14:04,518 --> 01:14:06,458
(We should ask them.)

1916
01:14:07,518 --> 01:14:10,788
(They enter the crepe street, trying to memorize the sentence.)

1917
01:14:10,788 --> 01:14:11,818
Is this the place?

1918
01:14:12,488 --> 01:14:14,488
- Is this the place? - It's either one of them.

1919
01:14:14,488 --> 01:14:16,718
If it turns out to be the oldest place, I'll give you the rules.

1920
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:18,518
- What was it? - "Is this the oldest place?"

1921
01:14:18,518 --> 01:14:20,358
(Let me ask.)

1922
01:14:20,358 --> 01:14:22,888
Is this the oldest crepe place?

1923
01:14:22,888 --> 01:14:24,628
(Is this the oldest crepe place?)

1924
01:14:25,358 --> 01:14:30,988
(The place look similar to the other new stores.)

1925
01:14:30,988 --> 01:14:33,628
Yes, it is.

1926
01:14:33,628 --> 01:14:35,128
- Is this the place? - Is this the oldest place?

1927
01:14:35,128 --> 01:14:36,788
(They find the oldest place.)

1928
01:14:36,788 --> 01:14:38,718
- It is the oldest place. - It is.

1929
01:14:40,758 --> 01:14:45,458
(It's the oldest crepe place in Japan.)

1930
01:14:45,458 --> 01:14:49,658
(It's been in business in Harajuku for 41 years.)

1931
01:14:50,988 --> 01:14:52,288
Hye Sung, you choose first.

1932
01:14:53,058 --> 01:14:54,988
- Number 2. - Hye Sung chooses number 2.

1933
01:14:54,988 --> 01:14:57,958
(What will Hye Sung get?)

1934
01:14:57,958 --> 01:14:59,588
Here we go.

1935
01:15:00,988 --> 01:15:03,988
(No food and no stamp)

1936
01:15:05,358 --> 01:15:07,658
I get nothing. What did I say?

1937
01:15:07,658 --> 01:15:09,358
I said I was unlucky.

1938
01:15:09,688 --> 01:15:11,628
Hye Sung, do you want to wait in the car?

1939
01:15:12,718 --> 01:15:13,988
Jong Kook chose number three.

1940
01:15:13,988 --> 01:15:15,318
(Jong Kook's result is revealed.)

1941
01:15:16,188 --> 01:15:19,218
One, two...

1942
01:15:19,218 --> 01:15:20,688
(Who will get the stamp?)

1943
01:15:21,388 --> 01:15:25,288
(Jong Kook: crepe and no stamp, Kwang Soo: crepe and a stamp)

1944
01:15:25,628 --> 01:15:26,718
No way.

1945
01:15:27,288 --> 01:15:28,388
Kwang Soo.

1946
01:15:28,558 --> 01:15:31,888
(It's the Harajuku miracle.)

1947
01:15:33,388 --> 01:15:37,088
(He's been unlucky for 7 years. Is the curse broken now?)

1948
01:15:37,088 --> 01:15:38,988
This is so not fair.

1949
01:15:38,988 --> 01:15:42,058
He woke up late, and he got everything.

1950
01:15:42,058 --> 01:15:44,958
- He gets the food and the stamp! - He's trash.

1951
01:15:45,158 --> 01:15:47,488
- Wait. - I was the first one to get up.

1952
01:15:47,488 --> 01:15:49,758
Why am I trash? I didn't choose to do this.

1953
01:15:49,758 --> 01:15:53,288
He comes to Japan often and met many Japanese women.

1954
01:15:53,288 --> 01:15:55,518
He's used to Japan.

1955
01:15:55,518 --> 01:15:56,658
- I see. - What are you talking about?

1956
01:15:56,658 --> 01:15:58,488
- I'm not trying to make an excuse. - You have the power from Japan.

1957
01:15:58,488 --> 01:16:00,158
- He has the power from Japan. - What is she talking about?

1958
01:16:00,218 --> 01:16:02,888
- I was the first one to get up. - That won't do.

1959
01:16:02,988 --> 01:16:04,518
Let's order first.

1960
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:05,628
Please go ahead.

1961
01:16:05,628 --> 01:16:06,718
(He denies any rumors and orders crepe.)

1962
01:16:06,718 --> 01:16:07,918
She's making it.

1963
01:16:08,658 --> 01:16:10,818
- She's making it on the spot. - She must be a master.

1964
01:16:10,818 --> 01:16:12,788
(She adds whipped cream on top of baked dough.)

1965
01:16:12,788 --> 01:16:14,488
- That's incredible. - Is it kind of like...

1966
01:16:14,488 --> 01:16:16,418
- sweet pancakes in Korea? - I think so.

1967
01:16:17,058 --> 01:16:18,718
She's so good.

1968
01:16:18,918 --> 01:16:20,128
Originals are different.

1969
01:16:20,128 --> 01:16:22,918
(This is the original crepe.)

1970
01:16:24,658 --> 01:16:25,688
She didn't even take 10 seconds.

1971
01:16:25,688 --> 01:16:27,958
Can you ask how long she's been doing this for?

1972
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,218
Thank you very much.

1973
01:16:29,988 --> 01:16:31,388
It's been 10 years.

1974
01:16:31,388 --> 01:16:32,488
10 years?

1975
01:16:33,958 --> 01:16:35,158
Really?

1976
01:16:36,918 --> 01:16:38,988
Does that mean you started when you were in elementary school?

1977
01:16:39,758 --> 01:16:41,788
I started when I was in 18.

1978
01:16:41,988 --> 01:16:43,918
She started when she was in 18.

1979
01:16:43,988 --> 01:16:46,058
- Really? - I see.

1980
01:16:46,288 --> 01:16:47,988
- Thank you. - She looks to be 20.

1981
01:16:48,718 --> 01:16:50,158
- I'm serious. - Thank you.

1982
01:16:50,158 --> 01:16:52,888
Me? Pardon?

1983
01:16:52,888 --> 01:16:54,658
She said you look to be 20.

1984
01:16:55,518 --> 01:16:57,558
Can you tell her I'm 42?

1985
01:16:57,558 --> 01:16:59,558
(I'm 42 years old.)

1986
01:16:59,558 --> 01:17:00,758
(What? Really?)

1987
01:17:00,758 --> 01:17:04,458
Excuse me, but what are you guys doing?

1988
01:17:04,658 --> 01:17:06,188
- Are you trying to ask her out? - No.

1989
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:07,458
- Thank you. - Let's leave.

1990
01:17:07,458 --> 01:17:10,128
- You're acting strange in Japan. - No way.

1991
01:17:10,128 --> 01:17:11,658
Thank you.

1992
01:17:11,658 --> 01:17:14,388
- Thank you very much. - Thank you.

1993
01:17:14,388 --> 01:17:17,688
(Does this crepe contain a dose of love?)

1994
01:17:18,628 --> 01:17:20,718
It's the original. It's like the original granny's restaurant.

1995
01:17:20,718 --> 01:17:21,718
(How does the crepe taste?)

1996
01:17:21,718 --> 01:17:23,658
(Why is Hye Sung holding the crepe?)

1997
01:17:23,658 --> 01:17:24,718
Hye Sung.

1998
01:17:25,718 --> 01:17:27,658
(You see...)

1999
01:17:27,918 --> 01:17:29,818
- I gave it to her. - I'm taking a bite.

2000
01:17:29,818 --> 01:17:31,818
(I gave it to her.)

2001
01:17:31,818 --> 01:17:33,258
She wanted some.

2002
01:17:35,188 --> 01:17:40,088
(This strange man gave his hard-earned crepe to Hye Sung.)

2003
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:43,258
(What did you say? Oh, my goodness.)

2004
01:17:44,488 --> 01:17:50,988
(I feel bad for eating it alone. Would you like some?)

2005
01:17:50,988 --> 01:17:52,988
It's okay. Can I have a bite?

2006
01:17:52,988 --> 01:17:55,658
(It's okay, Hye Sung. Can I just have a bite?)

2007
01:17:58,988 --> 01:18:00,388
I know what this is.

2008
01:18:00,388 --> 01:18:02,888
(He pretends like he doesn't see it.)

2009
01:18:03,628 --> 01:18:05,558
I bet women like it.

2010
01:18:05,558 --> 01:18:08,458
(What's between Jong Kook and Hye Sung?)

2011
01:18:09,458 --> 01:18:10,818
Did you stay in New York for a long time?

2012
01:18:10,818 --> 01:18:12,718
No, I was in LA.

2013
01:18:13,088 --> 01:18:14,958
(Jong Kook and Hye Sung can't stop talking in the car.)

2014
01:18:14,958 --> 01:18:16,588
Don't you like going to the amusement park?

2015
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:18,658
I love amusement parks. I went by myself once...

2016
01:18:18,658 --> 01:18:20,088
because my friend didn't want to go.

2017
01:18:20,088 --> 01:18:25,058
(You know I'm here too, right?)

2018
01:18:25,988 --> 01:18:28,088
(Hye Sung, do you remember the chemistry you had with me earlier?)

2019
01:18:28,088 --> 01:18:31,288
I love going to the sea and surfing.

2020
01:18:33,188 --> 01:18:37,088
A lot of people do that.

2021
01:18:37,088 --> 01:18:38,088
(Forget it. What's the whole point?)

2022
01:18:38,288 --> 01:18:39,658
I love water too.

2023
01:18:39,658 --> 01:18:41,128
There's sea everywhere.

2024
01:18:41,128 --> 01:18:42,458
It's the same with every ethnicity.

2025
01:18:43,518 --> 01:18:46,958
If I don't react too much here, use the portion from Russia.

2026
01:18:47,488 --> 01:18:49,558
(What are you talking about, Kwang Soo?)

2027
01:18:50,288 --> 01:18:52,988
(Don't you remember, Jong Kook?)

2028
01:18:52,988 --> 01:18:58,058
(Don't you remember the love triangle 3 weeks ago?)

2029
01:18:58,558 --> 01:19:02,518
(Is this some sort of a deja vu?)

2030
01:19:02,518 --> 01:19:04,488
I wanted to try that.

2031
01:19:04,688 --> 01:19:06,458
- You drive... - Road trip.

2032
01:19:06,458 --> 01:19:08,918
- That's right. - It's the best.

2033
01:19:09,128 --> 01:19:11,258
- I wanted to try it. - It's the best.

2034
01:19:11,258 --> 01:19:12,818
(Get off. I want to be alone.)

2035
01:19:12,818 --> 01:19:15,188
- That sounds awesome. - You know what? The views...

2036
01:19:15,258 --> 01:19:16,958
- are incredible. - I think I would love it.

2037
01:19:16,958 --> 01:19:18,418
You'd get speechless.

2038
01:19:18,418 --> 01:19:19,858
(Actually, I can quit this team.)

2039
01:19:21,288 --> 01:19:23,888
(What's going on, Kwang Soo?)

2040
01:19:23,888 --> 01:19:25,418
Kwang Soo.

2041
01:19:25,418 --> 01:19:26,858
- Kwang Soo. - What?

2042
01:19:26,988 --> 01:19:28,418
- What's wrong? - I'm hot.

2043
01:19:28,418 --> 01:19:29,518
Let go.

2044
01:19:29,888 --> 01:19:31,318
- Let go. - What's wrong?

2045
01:19:31,658 --> 01:19:32,988
It's hot.

2046
01:19:33,488 --> 01:19:35,188
Why are you hot?

2047
01:19:36,588 --> 01:19:38,318
I'm just sharing my experience.

2048
01:19:38,318 --> 01:19:40,188
It'd be good for her to try.

2049
01:19:40,188 --> 01:19:42,288
It's a great experience.

2050
01:19:42,418 --> 01:19:44,888
You shouldn't have said you'd set us up.

2051
01:19:44,888 --> 01:19:47,188
(Don't ever say that again, Jong Kook.)

2052
01:19:47,188 --> 01:19:48,788
I'm sharing my travel stories.

2053
01:19:48,788 --> 01:19:49,858
No, it's okay.

2054
01:19:49,858 --> 01:19:51,718
- I'm okay. - We were talking about traveling.

2055
01:19:51,718 --> 01:19:53,418
I'm okay.

2056
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:56,288
- We're here. - You should...

2057
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:57,788
- try it. - It's fine.

2058
01:19:57,788 --> 01:19:58,858
(They're near their next destination.)

2059
01:19:59,688 --> 01:20:02,288
(Giggling)

2060
01:20:02,628 --> 01:20:05,158
When did this take the wrong turn?

2061
01:20:05,488 --> 01:20:06,988
Did I wake up too late?

2062
01:20:08,258 --> 01:20:10,088
Is it the king crab? When was it?

2063
01:20:10,518 --> 01:20:12,988
Can you go a bit back, Kwang Soo?

2064
01:20:16,218 --> 01:20:17,918
I'll go all the way back.

2065
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:19,818
I'll start walking from here.

2066
01:20:19,818 --> 01:20:22,318
Go, you two. It looks better that way. It looks great.

2067
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:23,388
- Why? - Keep going.

2068
01:20:23,388 --> 01:20:25,588
- What's wrong? - He wants me to go to the back.

2069
01:20:25,858 --> 01:20:27,818
He wants me to go to the back. I was covering you.

2070
01:20:27,818 --> 01:20:30,388
I was covering you two, so he wanted me to go away.

2071
01:20:30,718 --> 01:20:32,858
I shouldn't be standing here like a third wheel.

2072
01:20:32,858 --> 01:20:34,058
He wants me to go away.

2073
01:20:34,058 --> 01:20:35,858
- What do you mean? - I'm right.

2074
01:20:36,088 --> 01:20:37,628
I was going to leave you be anyways.

2075
01:20:37,628 --> 01:20:39,988
(Where did it all go wrong?)

2076
01:20:40,988 --> 01:20:42,188
It's here.

2077
01:20:42,188 --> 01:20:43,818
Paulista.

2078
01:20:44,188 --> 01:20:45,418
Let's do this together.

2079
01:20:45,718 --> 01:20:47,988
- Let's do this together. - Sure. I'm in.

2080
01:20:47,988 --> 01:20:49,258
- Together? - Let's try it.

2081
01:20:49,258 --> 01:20:50,288
Okay.

2082
01:20:50,318 --> 01:20:51,588
Okay? Let's try together.

2083
01:20:51,588 --> 01:20:53,888
- Sure. - Sure. Let's do it together.

2084
01:20:53,888 --> 01:20:56,718
If I get another stamp and win,

2085
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:58,088
- you two... - No.

2086
01:20:58,088 --> 01:20:59,518
This depends on luck.

2087
01:20:59,518 --> 01:21:01,188
- You'll arrange us in good places? - Yes.

2088
01:21:01,188 --> 01:21:02,388
(If Jae Seok wins, he'll give them good positions on the dice.)

2089
01:21:02,388 --> 01:21:03,858
Can you promise us?

2090
01:21:03,858 --> 01:21:06,988
- Stamp, autograph, copy, - Sure.

2091
01:21:07,388 --> 01:21:08,418
- and laminate. - You too.

2092
01:21:08,418 --> 01:21:09,458
(They finish their contract ritual.)

2093
01:21:09,458 --> 01:21:10,458
Okay.

2094
01:21:10,458 --> 01:21:12,188
- Let me win. - Okay.

2095
01:21:12,188 --> 01:21:13,488
- Make sure you help him win. - Help me, okay?

2096
01:21:13,488 --> 01:21:14,988
- We'll do this together. - We might get a stamp.

2097
01:21:14,988 --> 01:21:16,058
- That's right. - Of course.

2098
01:21:16,058 --> 01:21:17,628
- We'll start. - Start. Go ahead, So Min.

2099
01:21:17,888 --> 01:21:18,888
Go, So Min.

2100
01:21:18,988 --> 01:21:20,388
Please.

2101
01:21:21,658 --> 01:21:24,488
(They are betting their hopes on Jae Seok.)

2102
01:21:25,688 --> 01:21:27,158
Show me my luck.

2103
01:21:27,158 --> 01:21:29,958
(Will they be able to get some stamps?)

2104
01:21:31,888 --> 01:21:35,058
(They win stamps and food.)

2105
01:21:36,158 --> 01:21:38,588
(Their strategy worked.)

2106
01:21:39,688 --> 01:21:41,488
(Nice, So Min.)

2107
01:21:41,488 --> 01:21:43,218
You're awesome. I won a stamp.

2108
01:21:43,218 --> 01:21:44,958
That was awesome.

2109
01:21:45,258 --> 01:21:46,788
I have three stamps.

2110
01:21:46,958 --> 01:21:48,818
- It's possible. - It is.

2111
01:21:48,818 --> 01:21:52,318
Would you like three traditional coffee?

2112
01:21:52,318 --> 01:21:53,488
- Yes. - Yes.

2113
01:21:53,988 --> 01:21:55,088
Here it is.

2114
01:21:55,358 --> 01:21:56,688
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2115
01:21:56,688 --> 01:21:58,188
- Is this the oldest coffee? - Yes.

2116
01:21:58,318 --> 01:21:59,388
That's interesting.

2117
01:21:59,458 --> 01:22:00,488
The scent...

2118
01:22:00,658 --> 01:22:01,818
What do you think, Jae Seok?

2119
01:22:02,288 --> 01:22:03,518
It's old style.

2120
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:05,088
It's old style coffee.

2121
01:22:05,088 --> 01:22:06,288
It's plain, old style coffee.

2122
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:07,588
It does taste like old style coffee.

2123
01:22:07,758 --> 01:22:09,518
I'm getting nervous.

2124
01:22:09,918 --> 01:22:11,188
I think you can do it.

2125
01:22:11,188 --> 01:22:14,488
You won't betray us, right?

2126
01:22:14,488 --> 01:22:15,688
- Everybody. - Right?

2127
01:22:16,128 --> 01:22:17,488
If I become the winner,

2128
01:22:18,788 --> 01:22:20,218
I won't forget about you.

2129
01:22:20,218 --> 01:22:21,688
- Please become the king. - I'll never forget.

2130
01:22:21,888 --> 01:22:23,088
- I'll give you my vote. - Please become the king.

2131
01:22:23,088 --> 01:22:24,958
- I plead you. - Please become the king.

2132
01:22:25,088 --> 01:22:26,988
(I plead both of you.)

2133
01:22:27,158 --> 01:22:28,958
- Please help me, So Min. - I will.

2134
01:22:29,418 --> 01:22:32,158
I hope you don't forget our loyalty.

2135
01:22:32,158 --> 01:22:33,288
I won't.

2136
01:22:33,588 --> 01:22:35,818
Please make me the king.

2137
01:22:35,918 --> 01:22:38,058
- I know you can do it. - I'll work hard...

2138
01:22:38,288 --> 01:22:39,918
for you.

2139
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:42,488
Rise, King Grasshopper.

2140
01:22:43,518 --> 01:22:44,918
I'll send Jong Kook...

2141
01:22:45,988 --> 01:22:47,658
- abroad. - Please send him.

2142
01:22:47,788 --> 01:22:49,518
Ji Hyo has never been penalized.

2143
01:22:49,758 --> 01:22:51,358
- Please send her. - I'll send those two away.

2144
01:22:51,358 --> 01:22:52,658
Please keep your promises.

2145
01:22:52,658 --> 01:22:53,858
I will.

2146
01:22:53,918 --> 01:22:55,218
Please become the king.

2147
01:22:55,218 --> 01:22:57,088
(Please become the king...)

2148
01:22:57,088 --> 01:22:59,358
(and grant our wish.)

2149
01:23:00,058 --> 01:23:02,358
Rise, King Grasshopper.

2150
01:23:02,358 --> 01:23:04,558
(What will become the fate of King Grasshopper?)

2151
01:23:05,358 --> 01:23:07,218
Seok Jin, what about the oldest building?

2152
01:23:07,488 --> 01:23:08,518
Oldest building?

2153
01:23:09,158 --> 01:23:11,258
- Oldest building? - What about the oldest car?

2154
01:23:11,258 --> 01:23:12,918
Oldest building or oldest car.

2155
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:16,288
Or should we go to that bestselling lottery place?

2156
01:23:16,288 --> 01:23:17,358
Right.

2157
01:23:17,358 --> 01:23:19,258
- They're bestselling lottery place. - That's a good idea.

2158
01:23:19,518 --> 01:23:21,058
- We don't have time. - You only have...

2159
01:23:21,258 --> 01:23:22,518
(There's only 13 minutes left.)

2160
01:23:22,518 --> 01:23:24,388
You only have 13 minutes left.

2161
01:23:24,388 --> 01:23:25,818
- We have to get back too. - Right.

2162
01:23:25,818 --> 01:23:27,358
- It won't work then. - It won't.

2163
01:23:28,088 --> 01:23:29,518
It's too bad,

2164
01:23:30,058 --> 01:23:32,188
- but with limited time... - No, I'll get down on my knees.

2165
01:23:33,388 --> 01:23:34,658
Please.

2166
01:23:34,658 --> 01:23:36,288
(Let us do the mission.)

2167
01:23:36,288 --> 01:23:38,128
Isn't this the first ever?

2168
01:23:38,288 --> 01:23:39,788
- This is the first ever. - This is where...

2169
01:23:39,788 --> 01:23:41,358
Ji Hyo went down on her knees in Japan.

2170
01:23:41,418 --> 01:23:43,128
- That works. - You're right.

2171
01:23:43,218 --> 01:23:45,158
- Please give us a chance. - She's being sincere.

2172
01:23:45,158 --> 01:23:47,458
- You should accept this. - I'll beg.

2173
01:23:47,628 --> 01:23:48,988
Give us one chance.

2174
01:23:48,988 --> 01:23:51,588
(I'm sorry, but time is ticking. We must leave now.)

2175
01:23:54,058 --> 01:23:55,888
(Meanwhile)

2176
01:23:55,888 --> 01:23:58,888
- Are we passing by it again? - In 1, 2, 3.

2177
01:23:58,888 --> 01:24:01,058
(Kwang Soo wins 2 more stamps.)

2178
01:24:02,458 --> 01:24:04,628
Let's think about something else.

2179
01:24:04,628 --> 01:24:06,158
- What about a toy store? - Toy store?

2180
01:24:06,158 --> 01:24:08,188
Or McDonald's? The burger restaurant?

2181
01:24:09,788 --> 01:24:14,558
Book... Bestselling book.

2182
01:24:14,918 --> 01:24:16,988
- Bestseller. - That works.

2183
01:24:16,988 --> 01:24:18,518
Let's go for the bestselling book.

2184
01:24:18,518 --> 01:24:20,128
We can do albums too.

2185
01:24:20,128 --> 01:24:21,358
That's right.

2186
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:24,688
How pretty.

2187
01:24:24,688 --> 01:24:26,058
Excuse me, sir. Are there any...

2188
01:24:26,058 --> 01:24:29,388
- first ever places in Japan? - Are there any?

2189
01:24:29,628 --> 01:24:33,158
There's this really old supply store nearby.

2190
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:36,088
- Let's go. - How old is it?

2191
01:24:38,488 --> 01:24:39,758
(Well...)

2192
01:24:39,988 --> 01:24:42,058
It's really old. Maybe over 100 years?

2193
01:24:43,588 --> 01:24:45,158
- Let's go there. - Let's go. Okay.

2194
01:24:45,158 --> 01:24:46,758
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2195
01:24:46,758 --> 01:24:47,918
- Thank you. - Itoya?

2196
01:24:47,918 --> 01:24:50,288
Do you have the comic book "One Piece"?

2197
01:24:50,558 --> 01:24:51,918
- "One Piece". - "One Piece".

2198
01:24:52,418 --> 01:24:53,988
- Okay. Thank you. - They have it.

2199
01:24:54,158 --> 01:24:55,258
It's here.

2200
01:24:55,258 --> 01:24:58,518
"One Piece" is on Guinness World Records.

2201
01:24:58,518 --> 01:25:01,318
- It's been published the most. - Really?

2202
01:25:02,988 --> 01:25:05,558
It's "One Piece" volume 44.

2203
01:25:05,558 --> 01:25:06,588
Good.

2204
01:25:06,588 --> 01:25:07,658
Where is it?

2205
01:25:08,088 --> 01:25:09,458
Cross the street.

2206
01:25:09,518 --> 01:25:10,918
This is Itoya.

2207
01:25:11,188 --> 01:25:12,218
That.

2208
01:25:12,758 --> 01:25:14,158
It's huge.

2209
01:25:14,158 --> 01:25:16,088
- It's the oldest store. - This is it?

2210
01:25:16,288 --> 01:25:18,558
- It's so clean. - It's huge.

2211
01:25:18,558 --> 01:25:20,288
It's a stationery shop? It's so pretty.

2212
01:25:22,918 --> 01:25:26,318
(It's the first ever stationery shop that was built in Japan in 1904.)

2213
01:25:26,418 --> 01:25:28,988
(It has everything you could ask for from stationeries to necessities.)

2214
01:25:30,858 --> 01:25:31,858
Please.

2215
01:25:32,158 --> 01:25:34,458
Please become the king.

2216
01:25:34,718 --> 01:25:36,188
Just once.

2217
01:25:36,258 --> 01:25:37,258
- All right. - Please become the king.

2218
01:25:37,258 --> 01:25:39,388
Would you like to be together or separate?

2219
01:25:39,388 --> 01:25:40,858
- We've always been together. - We'll try together.

2220
01:25:40,858 --> 01:25:42,418
From beginning to end...

2221
01:25:42,418 --> 01:25:44,558
- We've always been together. - Since the start of this tour,

2222
01:25:44,558 --> 01:25:45,988
we've always been together.

2223
01:25:46,288 --> 01:25:48,688
Go, King Grasshopper.

2224
01:25:48,918 --> 01:25:50,718
- Go, King Grasshopper. - May I...

2225
01:25:50,718 --> 01:25:52,188
- try? - Do it.

2226
01:25:52,188 --> 01:25:53,418
(Lucky girl So Min turns the wheel.)

2227
01:25:55,858 --> 01:25:56,888
(Please...)

2228
01:25:56,888 --> 01:25:58,558
- I have a bad feeling. - It's okay.

2229
01:26:00,788 --> 01:26:02,758
Would you like to go together or separate?

2230
01:26:02,758 --> 01:26:04,258
- Let's do it separately. - Separate.

2231
01:26:04,258 --> 01:26:06,258
Choose a number, Kwang Soo.

2232
01:26:06,628 --> 01:26:08,258
I choose 2. No, 3.

2233
01:26:08,358 --> 01:26:10,088
- Is it three? - Okay.

2234
01:26:10,088 --> 01:26:11,088
(Kwang Soo chooses number 3 at the end.)

2235
01:26:12,358 --> 01:26:13,518
- It's simple. - Is this it?

2236
01:26:13,518 --> 01:26:14,558
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo are both in 1st place right now.)

2237
01:26:14,558 --> 01:26:15,558
That wasn't what you expected.

2238
01:26:15,558 --> 01:26:17,128
I have to get it this time.

2239
01:26:17,258 --> 01:26:20,358
You have to get it to win.

2240
01:26:20,358 --> 01:26:21,988
(This stamp will decide who the winner is.)

2241
01:26:24,658 --> 01:26:28,758
(Who's the ultimate winner?)

2242
01:26:31,458 --> 01:26:34,158
(5pm at Narita Airport)

2243
01:26:34,158 --> 01:26:35,918
Hello.

2244
01:26:35,918 --> 01:26:37,558
Everybody.

2245
01:26:37,558 --> 01:26:40,818
People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent.

2246
01:26:40,818 --> 01:26:43,388
I'll reveal the winner...

2247
01:26:43,388 --> 01:26:45,918
of the First Place Tour in Tokyo.

2248
01:26:45,918 --> 01:26:46,958
My gosh.

2249
01:26:46,988 --> 01:26:48,418
(Who gathered the most number of stamps?)

2250
01:26:48,418 --> 01:26:51,418
The winner of the First Place Tour...

2251
01:26:52,158 --> 01:26:53,918
collected...

2252
01:26:56,458 --> 01:26:59,788
(Is it Kwang Soo who went for 4 stamps at the end...)

2253
01:26:59,788 --> 01:27:01,818
(or Jae Seok?)

2254
01:27:03,358 --> 01:27:07,058
It's Jae Seok who won four stamps.

2255
01:27:07,058 --> 01:27:09,258
(Jae Seok is the winner of the 1st Place Tour.)

2256
01:27:09,258 --> 01:27:10,418
It's Jae Seok?

2257
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:12,318
Tell us. How did he win four stamps?

2258
01:27:13,718 --> 01:27:15,558
I almost had four.

2259
01:27:15,858 --> 01:27:16,988
I could have been the king.

2260
01:27:18,418 --> 01:27:20,458
(At the first ever stationery shop in Japan, )

2261
01:27:20,458 --> 01:27:22,458
(So Min spun the wheel.)

2262
01:27:23,188 --> 01:27:25,918
(She was the king maker...)

2263
01:27:25,918 --> 01:27:30,518
(who helped Jae Seok win.)

2264
01:27:31,188 --> 01:27:32,388
My gosh.

2265
01:27:32,758 --> 01:27:37,658
(Meanwhile, this was Kwang Soo's fourth try.)

2266
01:27:37,658 --> 01:27:40,858
(He hoped for something else, )

2267
01:27:40,858 --> 01:27:43,258
(but there was no miracle.)

2268
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:45,758
(He didn't win any stamps.)

2269
01:27:47,358 --> 01:27:48,918
- I almost had it. - Goodness.

2270
01:27:49,618 --> 01:27:50,888
That turned around.

2271
01:27:50,888 --> 01:27:53,088
- You've become the king. - Thanks so much.

2272
01:27:55,088 --> 01:28:00,258
(Jae Seok is the winner, so he doesn't get any I Go Stickers.)

2273
01:28:00,658 --> 01:28:05,618
(The person with the assigned number on the die gets an I Go Sticker.)

2274
01:28:07,718 --> 01:28:11,658
(If you get 3 I Go Stickers, you get to visit the recommended place.)

2275
01:28:12,858 --> 01:28:14,988
(That place for 1 percent...)

2276
01:28:14,988 --> 01:28:17,718
(might be scary or thrilling.)

2277
01:28:17,718 --> 01:28:21,518
(Which member will be on their way to that place for 1 percent?)

2278
01:28:22,518 --> 01:28:24,518
(Jae Seok's team members made him the king.)

2279
01:28:24,518 --> 01:28:26,858
(They were faithful king makers.)

2280
01:28:27,958 --> 01:28:32,188
(Jong Kook is the target because he always gets the best of them.)

2281
01:28:32,188 --> 01:28:35,418
(Ji Hyo is always exempt from penalties.)

2282
01:28:35,418 --> 01:28:36,618
Keep your promises.

2283
01:28:36,858 --> 01:28:41,118
(Please become the king and punish these two.)

2284
01:28:41,118 --> 01:28:42,758
The winner will get to decide your fates.

2285
01:28:43,188 --> 01:28:46,558
(Their fates depend on Jae Seok's hands.)

2286
01:28:48,218 --> 01:28:51,818
(It's party time for So Min and Haha.)

2287
01:28:51,818 --> 01:28:53,058
Why are they happy?

2288
01:28:53,058 --> 01:28:54,858
- Wasn't this an individual game? - They were on the same team.

2289
01:28:54,858 --> 01:28:56,688
- Things happened. - We were fighting intensely...

2290
01:28:56,958 --> 01:28:59,788
- and something happened. - Something worked out.

2291
01:28:59,788 --> 01:29:01,418
Please be understanding.

2292
01:29:01,888 --> 01:29:03,788
Can I toss the die?

2293
01:29:03,888 --> 01:29:05,258
You can practice.

2294
01:29:05,458 --> 01:29:07,988
I figured this out from yesterday.

2295
01:29:07,988 --> 01:29:09,518
It's all chances.

2296
01:29:09,518 --> 01:29:11,218
It's one-sixth of a chance.

2297
01:29:11,288 --> 01:29:13,518
I want to save my team members...

2298
01:29:13,518 --> 01:29:14,888
and give them the lower percentages.

2299
01:29:14,888 --> 01:29:16,688
What do you mean? It's all the same.

2300
01:29:17,258 --> 01:29:18,658
It's all the same.

2301
01:29:18,658 --> 01:29:19,758
I have a good feeling.

2302
01:29:19,758 --> 01:29:21,918
Me too. Let's think about chances.

2303
01:29:22,558 --> 01:29:23,658
(He gets 2.)

2304
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:24,658
What's that?

2305
01:29:24,788 --> 01:29:26,658
Research at home.

2306
01:29:26,658 --> 01:29:28,518
We have no time.

2307
01:29:28,858 --> 01:29:30,158
Why would you try it here?

2308
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:31,358
I don't have this at home.

2309
01:29:31,358 --> 01:29:32,358
(He ignores Jong Kook.)

2310
01:29:33,288 --> 01:29:34,718
- Why do you keep trying? - I got two.

2311
01:29:34,718 --> 01:29:36,158
- I keep getting two. - Stop it.

2312
01:29:36,158 --> 01:29:37,388
Please give me six.

2313
01:29:37,388 --> 01:29:38,918
- I'll give you six. - Thank you.

2314
01:29:38,918 --> 01:29:40,558
- I'll give you six. - Stop it.

2315
01:29:40,558 --> 01:29:43,358
- King Grasshopper. - King Grasshopper.

2316
01:29:43,358 --> 01:29:45,058
I'll assign my team members...

2317
01:29:45,958 --> 01:29:46,958
to six.

2318
01:29:46,958 --> 01:29:48,618
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2319
01:29:48,618 --> 01:29:50,888
- You are both six. - You can lay them out.

2320
01:29:50,888 --> 01:29:54,618
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo have to go. They have to go.

2321
01:29:54,618 --> 01:29:57,158
I'll put Jong Kook...

2322
01:29:57,158 --> 01:29:58,618
in three.

2323
01:29:58,618 --> 01:30:00,458
- Ji Hyo can take one. - Okay.

2324
01:30:00,888 --> 01:30:03,088
- Kwang Soo can be two. - Is there no dud?

2325
01:30:03,288 --> 01:30:04,318
Kwang Soo.

2326
01:30:04,988 --> 01:30:06,058
- All right. - Let's go.

2327
01:30:06,618 --> 01:30:08,218
Okay. Start.

2328
01:30:09,288 --> 01:30:12,718
(This is Jae Seok's lofty and calculated plan.)

2329
01:30:13,458 --> 01:30:18,418
(Will Jong Kook be chosen?)

2330
01:30:18,418 --> 01:30:19,658
(Or would it be Ji Hyo who's never been penalized?)

2331
01:30:19,658 --> 01:30:20,918
- Jae Seok. - I'm number five.

2332
01:30:20,918 --> 01:30:22,818
(Ji Hyo is number 1.)

2333
01:30:22,818 --> 01:30:25,158
(Will either of them be chosen?)

2334
01:30:26,258 --> 01:30:27,788
I figured this out yesterday. It's all about probability.

2335
01:30:27,788 --> 01:30:35,358
(From simulation, he got number 2 the most.)

2336
01:30:35,358 --> 01:30:37,518
(Unlucky Kwang Soo has that number.)

2337
01:30:39,158 --> 01:30:44,288
(Jae Seok put his team members in number 6 because he never got it.)

2338
01:30:44,288 --> 01:30:46,958
(King Grasshopper, please toss a small number.)

2339
01:30:47,358 --> 01:30:48,358
(What will happen to So Min and Haha?)

2340
01:30:48,888 --> 01:30:51,058
Please toss number six.

2341
01:30:51,058 --> 01:30:52,358
- Move. Move over. - Toss number six.

2342
01:30:52,988 --> 01:30:54,288
I hope it's not me.

2343
01:30:54,288 --> 01:30:56,288
(The die...)

2344
01:30:56,288 --> 01:30:59,258
(is cast.)

2345
01:30:59,258 --> 01:31:01,358
(Who will...)

2346
01:31:01,358 --> 01:31:03,418
(be the lucky ones?)

2347
01:31:04,558 --> 01:31:09,418
(Is it somebody unexpected or one of Jae Seok's targets?)

2348
01:31:15,058 --> 01:31:18,618
(Haha and So Min get a Sticker each.)

2349
01:31:18,618 --> 01:31:19,788
Jae Seok.

2350
01:31:19,788 --> 01:31:22,788
(Goodness)

2351
01:31:23,818 --> 01:31:26,718
(It's time to celebrate.)

2352
01:31:27,518 --> 01:31:29,458
(Is he serious?)

2353
01:31:29,788 --> 01:31:31,058
Toss it high.

2354
01:31:36,288 --> 01:31:38,988
He never got six in practice.

2355
01:31:38,988 --> 01:31:41,188
He never got six.

2356
01:31:41,518 --> 01:31:43,058
What was that?

2357
01:31:43,058 --> 01:31:45,858
- What are you? - I made this dramatic.

2358
01:31:45,858 --> 01:31:47,188
What are you?

2359
01:31:47,188 --> 01:31:49,058
- Viewers, I did it. - You punk.

2360
01:31:49,658 --> 01:31:50,988
- What are you? - Hey.

2361
01:31:54,288 --> 01:31:56,718
(Haha and So Min get an I Go Sticker each.)

2362
01:31:57,158 --> 01:31:59,418
(People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent)

2363
01:32:01,188 --> 01:32:03,258
(Mismatch Race)

2364
01:32:03,888 --> 01:32:05,088
I'm at exit eight.

2365
01:32:05,188 --> 01:32:07,258
(It's a possibility under 1 percent.)

2366
01:32:07,258 --> 01:32:09,658
(All members have to choose something different.)

2367
01:32:09,658 --> 01:32:12,718
(That's the only way for the race to end.)

2368
01:32:12,718 --> 01:32:13,718
(This is over, right?)

2369
01:32:14,818 --> 01:32:18,158
(These ladies make you look.)

2370
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:19,188
(Yes, it's you.)

2371
01:32:19,188 --> 01:32:20,188
(You next to her...)

2372
01:32:20,188 --> 01:32:21,558
(and you.)

2373
01:32:21,558 --> 01:32:23,158
(They'll make your heart flutter.)

2374
01:32:23,158 --> 01:32:24,918
(They're strange women...)

2375
01:32:24,918 --> 01:32:26,058
(and the more strange couples.)

2376
01:32:28,358 --> 01:32:30,288
(Yes, I want some new face.)

2377
01:32:30,288 --> 01:32:32,058
(They are strange women...)

2378
01:32:32,058 --> 01:32:33,658
(and strange faces.)

2379
01:32:35,518 --> 01:32:36,718
(Yes, I want some new race.)

2380
01:32:36,718 --> 01:32:38,918
(Next week on Running Man, Strange Partners)
