00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:08,743
(2017 Running Man's Second Global Project)

2
00:00:08,867 --> 00:00:12,197
People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent.

3
00:00:12,497 --> 00:00:17,397
(People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent)

4
00:00:18,397 --> 00:00:21,997
(The member with 3 I Go Stickers will go to a place for 1 percent...)

5
00:00:21,997 --> 00:00:25,597
(with a member they choose to go with.)

6
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:31,397
(As a result of the first race, the die chose...)

7
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:33,897
(Haha and So Min to receive a Sticker each.)

8
00:00:34,197 --> 00:00:37,697
(As a result of the second race, Seok Jin got a Sticker.)

9
00:00:38,327 --> 00:00:42,427
(Currently, Seok Jin, Haha, and So Min have 1 I Go Sticker each.)

10
00:00:43,067 --> 00:00:45,267
(And the mysterious people arrive.)

11
00:00:45,297 --> 00:00:46,897
- It's Tae Hwan. - It's Jin Young!

12
00:00:46,897 --> 00:00:48,027
(Lee Tae Hwan, Hong Jin Young)

13
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:50,827
(Son Yeo Eun, Na Eun, Ha Young)

14
00:00:50,827 --> 00:00:52,997
(Famous celebrities join Running Man as guests.)

15
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:55,769
(She shows off her dance in Gyeongju...)

16
00:00:55,769 --> 00:01:00,709
(which has brought huge attention online.)

17
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,469
(It's Son Na Eun with an unexpected charm.)

18
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,009
(And this man falls straight in love with her.)

19
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:13,369
(He's shy, but he'll take courage to take a step closer to her.)

20
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:16,269
(He has found his love in Gyeongju.)

21
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:22,569
(Stay tuned to find out if his love will come true.)

22
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:25,209
That was amazing.

23
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:28,739
- She's attractive. - She became even more charming.

24
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:32,381
It's hard to dance in high heels.

25
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:33,821
She looked very charming when she did this.

26
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:35,551
Can you do it again?

27
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:37,581
- Do you mean this? - Yes. Move the side.

28
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:40,081
- That's great. - That's great.

29
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:43,221
Isn't that a dance for Deux's "Look Back at Me"?

30
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:46,581
(Is it a dance for "Look Back at Me"?)

31
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:48,381
Gosh, he is old.

32
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:50,121
- Look back at yourself. - Psy must've liked...

33
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,081
the dance for "Look Back at Me".

34
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:54,781
What is wrong with your makeup?

35
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,421
What do you mean?

36
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:58,121
For goodness' sake.

37
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:00,081
I look the same whether I wear makeup or not.

38
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:01,751
Come to Jin Young.

39
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:03,251
- Jin Young can fix your makeup. - That's right.

40
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:06,921
Why are you so chatty today?

41
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:10,421
She is a strong woman.

42
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,821
- Step back. - I mean...

43
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:14,221
Okay.

44
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:15,951
- She is good. - She is a strong woman.

45
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:17,681
She is a strong woman.

46
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:20,021
- Please keep Jong Kook in check. - We have things in order.

47
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:21,651
We have things in order.

48
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:23,381
- That was nice. - I knew it.

49
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:25,351
Jin Young is the only one who can do that.

50
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:26,781
Jin Young and Moon Sook.

51
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:28,921
They are male and female gangsters.

52
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:31,721
- I was only making an example. - Kwang Soo.

53
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,721
I meant that the two of you are like a couple.

54
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:34,721
Don't say that.

55
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:35,821
Jong Kook is a male gangster.

56
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:37,251
(He goes over the fact.)

57
00:02:37,251 --> 00:02:39,781
- What are you talking about? - It is true.

58
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:41,591
Don't be ridiculous.

59
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:42,621
Haha.

60
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:43,981
Should I button or unbutton my shirt?

61
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:45,081
- Unbutton it. - Does that look better?

62
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,251
(Fiddling)

63
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:48,121
- He is driving me crazy. - Why?

64
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:49,551
"Should I button or unbutton my shirt?"

65
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:51,651
You should take off your shirt.

66
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:54,021
- No. - Why don't you take it off?

67
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:55,251
Here is what I think.

68
00:02:55,421 --> 00:02:58,181
I don't know if it's possible, but it would look best...

69
00:02:58,181 --> 00:03:01,251
if you can button the shirt and remove your body.

70
00:03:01,251 --> 00:03:03,321
(The shirt isn't the problem.)

71
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:04,421
This shirt is pretty.

72
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,481
This shirt is very pretty.

73
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:11,951
- I am serious. - The atmosphere is nice today.

74
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:14,151
(The atmosphere is nice today.)

75
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:16,251
You are laughing hard at the smallest things.

76
00:03:16,381 --> 00:03:17,751
- I am happy. - I know.

77
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:19,751
The opening is going smoothly today.

78
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:22,051
I was very tired because I couldn't sleep last night.

79
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:23,251
You still feel happy.

80
00:03:23,251 --> 00:03:24,751
I don't care about the ratings for this episode.

81
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:26,821
I am very happy.

82
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:29,121
(Ratings fade with time, )

83
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:32,051
(but our memories will be forever.)

84
00:03:32,151 --> 00:03:35,181
Your happiness and the bad ratings will cancel the program.

85
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:38,621
(A program with bad ratings is bound to be canceled.)

86
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:40,581
- Why would you say that? - We still need good ratings.

87
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:41,821
- Let's go. - For goodness' sake.

88
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,521
- That's how happy I am. - Okay.

89
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:45,581
Pull yourself together and commit to the shoot.

90
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:47,221
- Your words scared me. - Let's not get too excited.

91
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:48,981
After Na Eun...

92
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:50,581
is the youngest member of Apink,

93
00:03:50,581 --> 00:03:52,321
- Ha Young. - Ha Young.

94
00:03:52,821 --> 00:03:54,081
Oh Ha Young.

95
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:55,581
Ha Young, this is...

96
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:57,951
- your first visit to Running Man. - This is my first visit.

97
00:03:57,951 --> 00:03:59,051
That's right.

98
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:02,021
We recently went to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.

99
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:03,251
- I heard that you went there. - Really?

100
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:06,851
- I went there alone. - What?

101
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:07,881
(How did she go there alone?)

102
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,421
Did you go there alone?

103
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:11,081
(Ha Young, you and I have a similarity.)

104
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:12,721
Kwang Soo, come back here.

105
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:14,621
I went alone, too.

106
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,221
People who went alone share a connection.

107
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:18,981
Shaking hands is not allowed...

108
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:20,251
- before you partner up. - Don't do it.

109
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:21,621
It's foul play.

110
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:23,181
- You know, - You need to stop.

111
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:25,321
I don't think I deserve a punch for a handshake.

112
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:28,391
He punched me in the face.

113
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:29,781
Jong Kook, take him to the back.

114
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:31,621
- I mean... - Teach him a lesson.

115
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:32,981
- I mean... - What do you think you are doing?

116
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:35,821
Wasn't it scary to be alone at Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear?

117
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:38,251
- You went with a cameraman. - Right.

118
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:40,451
I held a camera and went inside by myself.

119
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:41,681
Didn't you scream?

120
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,951
I screamed,

121
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:45,251
but it wasn't very scary because I knew they were people.

122
00:04:45,621 --> 00:04:47,621
That's incredible. She is brave.

123
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,621
We knew they were people, too.

124
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:51,151
How long did it take for you to come out?

125
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:52,821
It took me about 30 minutes.

126
00:04:52,821 --> 00:04:54,081
- She only spent 30 minutes. - That's fast.

127
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:56,121
It's annoying to see her brag.

128
00:04:56,781 --> 00:04:58,021
What does that make us?

129
00:04:58,781 --> 00:04:59,821
I don't know if you knew,

130
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:02,251
- but Ha Young can read minds. - Can she read minds?

131
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:04,251
- She has talent in mind reading. - Yes, I do.

132
00:05:04,251 --> 00:05:05,781
- Can you read minds? - Yes, I can.

133
00:05:05,781 --> 00:05:06,891
That's scary.

134
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:08,391
That's a bit scary.

135
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:10,951
Would you read a member's mind?

136
00:05:10,951 --> 00:05:12,821
What is Se Chan thinking?

137
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:18,451
(Ha Young, can you read my mind?)

138
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,721
(Let's see.)

139
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:24,321
He is very nervous right now.

140
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:25,821
- Why? - Why?

141
00:05:27,781 --> 00:05:29,381
It's because he saw us women.

142
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:31,421
(Thinking hard)

143
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:32,551
- Okay. - Who is making him nervous?

144
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:34,521
- We can guess that much. - Who wouldn't be able to do that?

145
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:36,121
Wait a minute.

146
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:37,521
Wait a minute.

147
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:42,051
In that case, would you read a staff member's mind?

148
00:05:42,421 --> 00:05:43,951
His legs are hurting.

149
00:05:44,181 --> 00:05:45,221
He is sitting down.

150
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:46,951
Do your legs hurt?

151
00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:48,181
No.

152
00:05:48,651 --> 00:05:50,081
(No)

153
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:51,881
They will hurt.

154
00:05:53,181 --> 00:05:54,621
Is she cursing him?

155
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:57,321
- He says his legs don't hurt. - Are you cursing him?

156
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:58,921
You said that his legs will hurt.

157
00:05:59,021 --> 00:06:00,851
- It's not like that. - Okay.

158
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:02,381
Anyway,

159
00:06:02,381 --> 00:06:04,151
since she is on the show for the first time,

160
00:06:04,151 --> 00:06:06,521
we hope she will enjoy her time with us.

161
00:06:06,521 --> 00:06:07,921
It's good to have her here.

162
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:09,781
We have another celebrity who is the talk of the town.

163
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:11,251
Lee Sun Bin.

164
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:13,221
(Lee Sun Bin)

165
00:06:13,421 --> 00:06:14,951
Lee Sun Bin.

166
00:06:14,951 --> 00:06:16,781
(It's Sun Bin.)

167
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:18,781
Sun Bin,

168
00:06:18,781 --> 00:06:20,381
you said that Kwang Soo was your ideal type.

169
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,151
Kwang Soo actually paid you a visit.

170
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:26,921
(Last fall, Kwang Soo verified her claim.)

171
00:06:27,581 --> 00:06:30,151
("My ideal type really is Lee Kwang Soo.")

172
00:06:30,151 --> 00:06:32,421
(Yes, it's the truth.)

173
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:36,021
(The truth was revealed.)

174
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,581
(False)

175
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:44,581
(Sun Bin's claim only left a scar in Kwang Soo's heart.)

176
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:45,981
I know.

177
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:48,081
I felt so dejected that day...

178
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:50,921
that I couldn't sleep.

179
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:52,021
All right.

180
00:06:52,021 --> 00:06:54,921
Do you still have feelings for Kwang Soo?

181
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:58,251
(Does she still have feelings for him?)

182
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:00,921
- Of course. - Really?

183
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,081
Yes.

184
00:07:02,251 --> 00:07:06,681
(Is Sun Bin's ideal type still Kwang Soo?)

185
00:07:06,881 --> 00:07:08,851
Please give me the lie detector.

186
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:11,981
Do we have it? Did you bring it?

187
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:13,251
Did you bring it?

188
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:15,121
It's pretty accurate.

189
00:07:15,121 --> 00:07:16,321
(A lie detector appears.)

190
00:07:16,651 --> 00:07:17,781
(Flustered)

191
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:20,221
I tried to hold back that time, but I felt like I was dying.

192
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:21,781
- You tried to hold back? - Yes.

193
00:07:23,221 --> 00:07:24,351
I hope it goes well.

194
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:25,521
I am serious.

195
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:26,921
Me, too.

196
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:28,551
If she is serious, you won't have to look elsewhere.

197
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:29,651
(Sun Bin, tell me how you feel.)

198
00:07:30,521 --> 00:07:33,351
Please answer when I ask you a question.

199
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:36,851
- Kwang Soo has feelings for her. - Right.

200
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:41,251
"I am still interested in Kwang Soo."

201
00:07:42,221 --> 00:07:43,251
Yes.

202
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:45,981
"I am still interested in Kwang Soo."

203
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:47,981
Yes.

204
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:50,721
(To Kwang Soo, who has always sought after love, )

205
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:52,751
(Sun Bin expresses her interest.)

206
00:07:52,751 --> 00:07:54,351
- That's cool. - I hope it's true.

207
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:58,521
(Is her answer true?)

208
00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:03,481
(True)

209
00:08:03,481 --> 00:08:04,721
- It's true. - Really?

210
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:09,321
(My goodness, it's true.)

211
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:11,551
Fine. Take this away.

212
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:13,021
(I don't like this lie detector.)

213
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:15,221
Jae Seok, how can you finish it that way?

214
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:16,321
How can you finish it that way?

215
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:17,581
- Kwang Soo should go. - Kwang Soo?

216
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,081
- Kwang Soo should go. - For goodness' sake.

217
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,021
- Kwang Soo should go. - I am confident.

218
00:08:21,021 --> 00:08:22,581
- He means his words. - That's right.

219
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:23,821
He has feelings for her.

220
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:25,351
Let's go.

221
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:26,681
- I will ask you one question. - Okay.

222
00:08:26,681 --> 00:08:28,081
- Look her in the face. - Answer the question.

223
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:29,221
- All right. - Look at Sun Bin.

224
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:30,381
(It's his chance to show her his heart.)

225
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:34,621
(Sun Bin, I will show you my heart.)

226
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:40,521
"Today,."

227
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,151
"I like my outfit."

228
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:45,651
(Today, I like my outfit.)

229
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:47,021
Answer the question.

230
00:08:47,351 --> 00:08:49,221
- Answer the question. - Go ahead.

231
00:08:49,351 --> 00:08:50,721
- There is one question. - Yes.

232
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:52,551
Let's see if it's true.

233
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:54,681
It's true.

234
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:56,881
Is that it? Is that it?

235
00:08:56,881 --> 00:08:58,521
That's it.

236
00:08:58,521 --> 00:09:00,221
Why would you be curious about that?

237
00:09:00,221 --> 00:09:02,251
I like my outfit, okay?

238
00:09:02,621 --> 00:09:03,821
All right.

239
00:09:03,821 --> 00:09:05,851
Both of them spoke the truth.

240
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:07,491
- They like each other. - Congratulations.

241
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:08,951
Congratulations.

242
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:10,651
(Will it really end this way?)

243
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:11,821
The next guest is...

244
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:14,251
Son Yeo Eun.

245
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:16,081
(Son Yeo Eun)

246
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:17,491
Also known as Ha Eun's mom.

247
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,681
The thing is,

248
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:22,421
she resembles So Min.

249
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:24,151
Do people tell you that often?

250
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:26,351
Yes, they do. So Min is always present...

251
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:27,951
- among the related keywords. - I see.

252
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:30,151
Son Na Eun is also there since her name is similar.

253
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:31,921
- I see. - Jeon So Min, too,

254
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:34,751
- Yeo Eun has a specialty. - What is it?

255
00:09:34,751 --> 00:09:35,921
She has the perfect pitch.

256
00:09:35,921 --> 00:09:37,251
(Does she have the perfect pitch?)

257
00:09:37,551 --> 00:09:38,681
She has the perfect pitch.

258
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:41,221
(I said that, didn't I?)

259
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,851
She is a bit like So Min.

260
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,781
I think she will get it wrong.

261
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:47,551
She majored in piano.

262
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:48,551
(She majored in piano at a university.)

263
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:49,721
Then she would know.

264
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:51,021
Even if she doesn't have the perfect pitch,

265
00:09:51,021 --> 00:09:53,851
piano majors get tested on the musical notes.

266
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:56,451
She can play the piano very well.

267
00:09:56,451 --> 00:09:58,451
- She can probably play it. - You can play it, right?

268
00:09:58,551 --> 00:09:59,881
- Yes. - Please play something.

269
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:01,251
I haven't played the melodica in a long time.

270
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:03,721
She can move her fingers very quickly.

271
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:04,991
Hold the melodica.

272
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:06,851
- What is there to play? - You can play anything...

273
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:08,021
- you are comfortable with. - My mind is blank.

274
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:10,021
"The School Bell".

275
00:10:10,021 --> 00:10:12,421
(Is she asking a piano major to play "The School Bell"?)

276
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:13,491
What is she talking about?

277
00:10:13,491 --> 00:10:15,651
Who doesn't know how to play it?

278
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:18,351
So Min, even I can play "The School Bell".

279
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:20,451
Can you play Chopin?

280
00:10:22,251 --> 00:10:26,381
(Yeo Eun begins to play "Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2".)

281
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,081
It's Chopin.

282
00:10:30,081 --> 00:10:32,021
- It's Chopin. - She is really playing Chopin.

283
00:10:33,921 --> 00:10:37,621
(Breathing)

284
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:40,251
She has shortness of breath.

285
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:41,991
She doesn't have a big lung capacity.

286
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:46,451
(She ends the impromptu performance with a reddened face.)

287
00:10:46,451 --> 00:10:47,581
Chopin!

288
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:48,721
She is good.

289
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:50,181
Does she have the perfect pitch?

290
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:52,451
It's finally the time to introduce Hong Jin Young.

291
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,351
She is...

292
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:55,721
the queen of events.

293
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,921
- She is the queen of trot. - That's right.

294
00:10:57,921 --> 00:10:59,781
Hong Jin Young!

295
00:10:59,921 --> 00:11:01,751
Hong Jin Young!

296
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:02,981
- I love her. - She makes you happy.

297
00:11:02,981 --> 00:11:06,381
- You composed "Ring Ring". - That's right.

298
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:08,251
The version you sang with Young Chul...

299
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,221
became a hit.

300
00:11:10,251 --> 00:11:12,521
We are receiving a lot of love.

301
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:14,251
- That's right. - The reaction is nice.

302
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:16,581
Is there another song you composed?

303
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:18,081
Yes, there is.

304
00:11:18,081 --> 00:11:19,851
- What is it? - I originally intended...

305
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:21,551
to give "Ring Ring" to Heo Kyung Hwan.

306
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:22,751
He missed his opportunity.

307
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,651
- I wrote another song for him. - You wrote another song.

308
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,681
Why do you write songs for Kyung Hwan?

309
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,251
Is there something between you and him?

310
00:11:30,021 --> 00:11:32,321
(They act like they aren't, but they're curious in fact.)

311
00:11:32,721 --> 00:11:35,181
Well, I promised to give him a song,

312
00:11:35,181 --> 00:11:38,351
but he missed the song due to the voting result.

313
00:11:38,751 --> 00:11:41,751
In a sense, he kicked his luck away himself, right?

314
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:43,451
So the song title is "I Kicked My Luck Away".

315
00:11:43,451 --> 00:11:45,451
(It's called "I Kicked My Luck Away".)

316
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:46,721
(That was such a natural way to introduce the song.)

317
00:11:46,721 --> 00:11:48,621
- "I Kicked My Luck Away". - I see.

318
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:50,781
- Can you sing a little for us? - Sing us the melody of it.

319
00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:53,081
(I kicked my luck away)

320
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:55,821
(Bouncing to the rhythm)

321
00:11:55,821 --> 00:11:57,181
You can dance right to it.

322
00:11:57,981 --> 00:12:00,351
(That sounds so familiar.)

323
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:01,921
(They're speechless.)

324
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:02,981
You're helpless.

325
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:05,121
It feels a bit like Jo Hye Ryun too.

326
00:12:05,121 --> 00:12:06,621
(It's very familiar.)

327
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:09,581
- Exactly. - Jo Hye Ryun.

328
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:10,751
It's exactly like her.

329
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:13,221
- Not long ago... - I kicked my luck away.

330
00:12:13,221 --> 00:12:14,921
Not long ago, my aunt...

331
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:16,581
danced exactly the same at her 60th birthday party.

332
00:12:16,981 --> 00:12:18,081
I'm being serious.

333
00:12:18,181 --> 00:12:19,721
- It's exactly the same. - She's a girl of different colors.

334
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:20,721
I'm serious.

335
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:22,981
(They begin the race with these charming girls.)

336
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:25,921
People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent.

337
00:12:25,921 --> 00:12:28,121
The 3rd race is called Number 1 Couple Race.

338
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:29,321
(Number 1 Couple Race)

339
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:32,481
The mission money will be crucial in winning this race today as well.

340
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:33,721
It's about I Go Stickers, right?

341
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:35,181
Right, it's about I Go Stickers.

342
00:12:35,481 --> 00:12:36,751
- I almost forgot. - Me too.

343
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:39,721
A couple who has the most amount of money at the end will win the race.

344
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:41,681
They'll be exempted from receiving a Sticker,

345
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:44,021
and they'll get to throw the die.

346
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,751
Also, a guest in the winning team...

347
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:47,651
will receive a pair of golden rings.

348
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:50,321
(A guest who wins the race will earn a pair of golden rings.)

349
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,721
(Motivated)

350
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:56,121
All right. Now, before we move onto the race,

351
00:12:56,121 --> 00:12:58,981
you'll first decide your partner in this mission.

352
00:12:59,121 --> 00:13:00,851
Each of the seven girls have told us...

353
00:13:00,851 --> 00:13:03,981
a keyword of the competition in which they're the best.

354
00:13:03,981 --> 00:13:06,081
Male members will decide their partners...

355
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:08,251
only by looking at these keywords...

356
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:09,921
and choosing one of them.

357
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:11,221
After you find your partners,

358
00:13:11,221 --> 00:13:13,921
the girls will compete to prove their keywords.

359
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:15,851
If they do win first place in the competition they mentioned,

360
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:17,821
corresponding couples will earn...

361
00:13:17,821 --> 00:13:19,221
extra 10 dollars for their mission money.

362
00:13:19,221 --> 00:13:20,321
Let's be on our toes.

363
00:13:20,581 --> 00:13:21,851
- Can I go wash my face? - Let's do this.

364
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:23,181
(They have only one chance in deciding their partners.)

365
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:24,981
Let's see the keywords.

366
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:27,181
"Best Hands", "Best Cuteness", "Best Eyes",

367
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,521
"Best Waist", "Best Magnet",

368
00:13:29,621 --> 00:13:30,981
and "Best Dance".

369
00:13:30,981 --> 00:13:32,481
I should say, Best Magnet is...

370
00:13:32,481 --> 00:13:33,481
Best Waist"?

371
00:13:33,651 --> 00:13:35,581
Who could Best Punch be? Is it Jin Young?

372
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,621
(Is Jin Young's keyword "Best Punch"?)

373
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:39,521
- Who could be Best Waist? - Best Waist.

374
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:42,081
- They all have small waists. - I know.

375
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:46,081
I see several of what I should avoid.

376
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:47,081
What are they?

377
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:49,651
(It's better to partner up with someone new.)

378
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:52,081
You can go ahead and choose your partners now.

379
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,121
I'll go with Best Hands.

380
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:54,981
- Why are you... - Goodness.

381
00:13:56,481 --> 00:13:57,681
Best Hands.

382
00:13:58,021 --> 00:14:00,181
If you're done choosing,

383
00:14:00,181 --> 00:14:02,121
hide and reveal them one by one.

384
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:03,951
It caught my eyes, so I chose this.

385
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:06,381
I think it's either of the two.

386
00:14:06,381 --> 00:14:07,381
Who are the two?

387
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:09,221
I assume it's either Sun Bin...

388
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:11,381
or Na Eun. That's what I think.

389
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:12,521
I'll reveal my choice now.

390
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:14,021
I chose Best Dance.

391
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,651
- Who is it? - It must be So Min.

392
00:14:16,821 --> 00:14:18,451
A girl whose keyword is Best Dance is...

393
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:21,151
Please come on out!

394
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:24,381
It's Yeo Eun!

395
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:26,251
(Yeo Eun comes out unexpectedly.)

396
00:14:27,121 --> 00:14:29,021
(It's me.)

397
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:30,321
- It's you? - Really?

398
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:31,821
- It's you? - Well...

399
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:33,951
- This is unexpected. - Is she really good at dancing?

400
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:35,581
Are you really good at dancing?

401
00:14:35,851 --> 00:14:37,751
You told this keyword yourself, right?

402
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,621
Well... I...

403
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:41,381
I learned how to do modern dance in the past.

404
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,251
Then we should check it out.

405
00:14:43,521 --> 00:14:46,021
- We can't miss out. - She was hiding her charm.

406
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:48,321
It's your turn, Haha.

407
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:51,121
I thought of choosing this right away when I saw this keyword.

408
00:14:51,121 --> 00:14:54,321
I too was going to choose it, but then...

409
00:14:54,521 --> 00:14:58,181
I could sense whose keyword it was. It sounds so absurd, you see.

410
00:14:58,181 --> 00:15:00,351
(Who's behind this absurd keyword?)

411
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,151
Whose keyword is Best Magnet?

412
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:03,551
Please come on out.

413
00:15:03,551 --> 00:15:04,581
(Who's Best Magnet?)

414
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:06,751
(It's So Min.)

415
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:08,851
Hey, what's wrong? Why aren't you happy?

416
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:10,321
Why aren't you happy?

417
00:15:10,351 --> 00:15:12,521
(Yes, my partner is Haha!)

418
00:15:12,821 --> 00:15:13,921
It's So Min.

419
00:15:13,921 --> 00:15:15,981
(Surprised and disappointed)

420
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:18,721
All right, Haha and So Min are a couple.

421
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,181
We'll check on her keyword later.

422
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,621
I'm just being curious,

423
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:25,451
but aren't you going to switch your choices?

424
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:27,451
(Aren't you going to switch your choices?)

425
00:15:27,851 --> 00:15:29,251
Do you want us to?

426
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:31,921
- I mean... - Well...

427
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:34,221
- Is something wrong? - I'm not sure who it is,

428
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:36,381
- but she doesn't like her partner. - It must be Best Eyes, right?

429
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:37,621
This has never happened before.

430
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:38,681
Why did you ask this suddenly?

431
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:40,521
Why?

432
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:42,681
I was just wondering.

433
00:15:43,181 --> 00:15:44,751
You're being very straightforward.

434
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:46,481
It's usually hard to be this straightforward.

435
00:15:46,481 --> 00:15:47,851
Not many people express like this.

436
00:15:47,851 --> 00:15:48,921
Maybe she really hates her partner.

437
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:51,381
It's not what I meant. I'm just wondering...

438
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:53,521
I don't know who it will be, but that person must be very upset.

439
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:57,251
She'd rather go to the Labyrinth alone.

440
00:15:57,421 --> 00:15:59,121
She thinks he's scarier than ghosts.

441
00:15:59,121 --> 00:16:01,181
I think it's you, Se Chan.

442
00:16:01,181 --> 00:16:02,251
- It's you. - Is it me?

443
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:04,651
Whom do you want to change his choice?

444
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:07,651
(Can you be a little more specific?)

445
00:16:07,651 --> 00:16:10,481
(They're all nervous.)

446
00:16:11,381 --> 00:16:13,321
I'd like Seok Jin to change his choice.

447
00:16:13,321 --> 00:16:16,451
(Seok Jin, please change your choice.)

448
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:20,881
- I'm with this until the end. - You're doomed.

449
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:23,451
- Don't even think about it. - You're completely doomed.

450
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,081
- It's hilarious. - It's funny.

451
00:16:26,321 --> 00:16:28,621
I was going to change my choice, but now, I'll never do it.

452
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:32,121
We're not sure whose keyword it is yet.

453
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:34,181
- We're not sure yet. - Right, it's not me.

454
00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:36,251
- Tell me about it. - We'll find out later.

455
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:37,381
Next is...

456
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,351
- Se Chan. - Let's see the end of it today.

457
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:42,881
All of you look very depressed to find out what my choice is.

458
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:44,421
It's not a penalty, you see.

459
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:47,581
If what you said is true, the one with the most depressed face is...

460
00:16:47,581 --> 00:16:49,021
Na Eun among them.

461
00:16:49,021 --> 00:16:51,121
Na Eun is grinding her teeth now.

462
00:16:51,351 --> 00:16:53,121
- She's... - She doesn't look very happy.

463
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:55,151
If it's really Na Eun, play the song for her.

464
00:16:55,751 --> 00:16:58,721
If it turns out she really is his partner,

465
00:16:58,721 --> 00:17:00,251
- please play "New Face" for her. - Sounds good.

466
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:02,021
- All right. - It can't be.

467
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,121
Whose keyword is Best Waist? Please come on out!

468
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:07,551
(She confidently volunteered to be the Best Waist.)

469
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:11,121
- Whose keyword is Best Waist? - Please.

470
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:12,821
- Please come on out! - No way.

471
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:13,981
Why isn't anyone coming out?

472
00:17:13,981 --> 00:17:17,351
(Who is the one with this keyword?)

473
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:20,321
- Who... - Wait!

474
00:17:20,951 --> 00:17:22,321
(It's really Na Eun.)

475
00:17:22,721 --> 00:17:23,721
- Who... - Wait!

476
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:25,921
(He's excited to find out it's Na Eun.)

477
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,621
Let's dance together.

478
00:17:32,621 --> 00:17:35,121
(He's so excited that his dance becomes gross.)

479
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:40,721
(Se Chan and Na Eun are a couple.)

480
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:42,821
Yes! It's great!

481
00:17:42,821 --> 00:17:44,481
This is it!

482
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,521
I guess Gyeongju goes so well with me.

483
00:17:46,521 --> 00:17:48,581
- Hey, it's only you who faced her. - What?

484
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:50,351
- Na Eun was facing over there. - She didn't look at me?

485
00:17:50,621 --> 00:17:51,621
You didn't?

486
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:53,581
- All right, please come this way. - Goodness.

487
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:56,581
- It's amazing. - What if they measure...

488
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:59,351
and it turns out she isn't first place?

489
00:17:59,351 --> 00:18:00,351
What will happen then?

490
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:01,921
They won't receive the extra money.

491
00:18:02,351 --> 00:18:03,821
- But they're still a couple. - Yes.

492
00:18:03,821 --> 00:18:05,621
- It won't be changed? - It's set.

493
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:06,981
Do we stay with one partner until the end?

494
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:08,221
(She's desperate.)

495
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,221
Ha Young, stop it.

496
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,851
- I'm sorry, - Stop it already.

497
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:13,251
But we're not here to be actual couples.

498
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:14,721
We're here to play games as teams.

499
00:18:14,721 --> 00:18:15,721
(Endure for 8 hours, and it'll be done.)

500
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:17,821
We don't do love relationships these days.

501
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:19,191
(Will she be able to go against her fate?)

502
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:20,951
- All right, Se Chan. - Yes.

503
00:18:21,221 --> 00:18:22,721
- I'm so happy. - I see.

504
00:18:23,121 --> 00:18:24,121
- Hello? - Hello?

505
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:25,751
Is it true that Na Eun's next to you?

506
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:26,821
It's a fact.

507
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:28,191
- Really? - It's true.

508
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,021
I'm going to be a romantic guy today.

509
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:32,121
I'll be in love in Gyeongju today.

510
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:34,751
- It's a fact. - It's for certain.

511
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:36,651
It's great.

512
00:18:36,651 --> 00:18:38,851
Next up is Jong Kook.

513
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:40,851
- Let's see who's his partner. - Who will it be?

514
00:18:40,851 --> 00:18:42,321
It's Best Cuteness.

515
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,121
- Best Cuteness. - "You."

516
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:45,751
Jong Kook, you!

517
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:48,691
- You! - Goodness.

518
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:50,351
I'm going to you!

519
00:18:50,351 --> 00:18:51,381
It's you?

520
00:18:52,191 --> 00:18:53,621
(He's given up now.)

521
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:55,921
It's the end? Is it really her?

522
00:18:55,981 --> 00:18:57,221
Just like this?

523
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:58,421
- Smile. - Okay.

524
00:18:58,421 --> 00:18:59,721
- It's the end. - Really?

525
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,751
- She told me to smile. - Yes, smile.

526
00:19:01,751 --> 00:19:04,121
- She told me to. - Next up is Tae Hwan.

527
00:19:04,121 --> 00:19:06,191
- Yes. - Which keyword did you choose?

528
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:07,621
I chose Best Hands.

529
00:19:07,621 --> 00:19:09,821
- Best Hands! - We can easily guess...

530
00:19:09,821 --> 00:19:11,321
- who it is right away. - Of course.

531
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:15,981
- That's why I chose this keyword. - Really?

532
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:17,251
(Touched)

533
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:18,321
Best Hands!

534
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:20,981
(Tae Hwan's partner is Ji Hyo.)

535
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:23,721
- Good. - I'm envious!

536
00:19:23,721 --> 00:19:26,721
- Good for you! - You're envious? I'm so happy.

537
00:19:27,821 --> 00:19:29,581
Look at you. You're wearing matching clothes.

538
00:19:29,581 --> 00:19:32,481
You three look like Marronnier who sang "Cocktail Love".

539
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:34,351
(They're like Marronnier who sang "Cocktail Love".)

540
00:19:34,351 --> 00:19:36,421
(Excited)

541
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:38,191
- Tae Hwan doesn't know the song. - You don't?

542
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:39,251
He doesn't know at all.

543
00:19:39,251 --> 00:19:41,321
(Stop it. He doesn't know that song.)

544
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:42,981
- Goodness. - Why don't you know?

545
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,191
- He has no idea. - My goodness.

546
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:49,451
(What's the name of the song again?)

547
00:19:49,451 --> 00:19:51,621
- Tae Hwan doesn't know the song. - You don't?

548
00:19:51,621 --> 00:19:53,921
Gosh, it's so upsetting.

549
00:19:53,921 --> 00:19:55,121
You really don't know this song?

550
00:19:55,121 --> 00:19:56,621
- I've heard of it. - On a gloomy day.

551
00:19:56,621 --> 00:19:58,191
He was like, "What are they doing?"

552
00:19:58,351 --> 00:19:59,621
- Gosh. - It's so sad.

553
00:19:59,621 --> 00:20:01,121
- It is, right? - Goodness.

554
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:02,651
But you're just like Marronnier.

555
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:03,691
(Tae Hwan and Ji Hyo are a couple.)

556
00:20:04,191 --> 00:20:05,921
Finally, next up is...

557
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:09,151
The two of you remain coincidently.

558
00:20:09,921 --> 00:20:12,191
You said you're not Best Eyes, right?

559
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:13,221
I'm not.

560
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:15,381
Then you'll be a couple with Kwang Soo.

561
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,221
Sun Bin will be Seok Jin's partner accordingly.

562
00:20:18,221 --> 00:20:19,221
Sure!

563
00:20:19,321 --> 00:20:21,481
Kwang Soo, you've become so reserved all of a sudden.

564
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:23,151
You're really being serious today.

565
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:24,751
Sun Bin isn't talking much either.

566
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:27,321
If they become a couple, we can call this fate.

567
00:20:27,621 --> 00:20:29,381
Ha Young, smile.

568
00:20:29,621 --> 00:20:30,621
(She acts like she's okay.)

569
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:35,021
All right. We have Best Eyes and Best Punch left.

570
00:20:35,021 --> 00:20:36,981
Please move to your partners now.

571
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:37,981
(They will go toward their partners at the same time.)

572
00:20:38,981 --> 00:20:41,581
(Eyes will be Seok Jin's partner, and Punch will be Kwang Soo's.)

573
00:20:41,581 --> 00:20:42,581
Please go ahead!

574
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,621
(Where will these girls go to?)

575
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,621
Can I decide not to go?

576
00:20:48,721 --> 00:20:51,121
(Can I play alone without a partner?)

577
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:52,821
- That's too much. - Where will you go then?

578
00:20:52,821 --> 00:20:54,021
Where will you go?

579
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:55,351
(Seok Jin and Ha Young are a couple.)

580
00:20:55,351 --> 00:20:56,451
- To me. - All right.

581
00:20:56,451 --> 00:20:59,451
Seok Jin and Ha Young are a team, and so is Kwang Soo and Sun Bin!

582
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:01,621
Please come this way.

583
00:21:02,551 --> 00:21:03,621
Kwang Soo!

584
00:21:03,851 --> 00:21:06,021
They're doing this like it's real.

585
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:09,381
(For today, he's really in love.)

586
00:21:09,651 --> 00:21:11,191
(Shy)

587
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:13,121
- It's been a while. - I know. How have you been?

588
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:14,121
Great, thanks.

589
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:18,381
(They aim to make memories instead of winning the race.)

590
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:22,921
(They're done deciding their partners now.)

591
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:25,221
Now, you've all became couples.

592
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:27,721
Looking at the keywords,

593
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:30,751
if you think your partner is better at it,

594
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:33,621
you can shout "Challenge" and have a battle to verify the keywords.

595
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:37,121
Let's start with Yeo Eun first. What kind of dance will you do?

596
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:40,981
I will express my name with a choreography of modern dance.

597
00:21:42,381 --> 00:21:47,651
(Her dance expressing her name already gained attention on KBS.)

598
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:50,481
(It was the ultimate, dreamy dance.)

599
00:21:50,981 --> 00:21:53,081
Then can you express Seok Jin's...

600
00:21:53,081 --> 00:21:55,481
name in your dance? Please express his name.

601
00:21:55,621 --> 00:21:56,681
(It's my name.)

602
00:21:57,951 --> 00:22:00,081
When she moves forward, she walks elegantly.

603
00:22:00,081 --> 00:22:01,321
She'll dance to this sad song?

604
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:08,121
What is that? What just happened?

605
00:22:08,121 --> 00:22:09,321
(Her legs moved like a wave.)

606
00:22:10,381 --> 00:22:12,781
(This is the dreamy dance of expressing Seok Jin's name.)

607
00:22:12,781 --> 00:22:14,321
She did modern dance.

608
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:18,381
(This is the dreamy, modern dance.)

609
00:22:18,381 --> 00:22:19,581
She looks serious too.

610
00:22:19,581 --> 00:22:21,151
This is how modern dances are.

611
00:22:21,151 --> 00:22:23,621
Everyone, now look at the name she'll express.

612
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:24,851
She will write Seok Jin's name.

613
00:22:24,851 --> 00:22:25,981
She didn't write it yet.

614
00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:27,821
Here she goes. She started.

615
00:22:28,621 --> 00:22:29,721
That's "J".

616
00:22:29,721 --> 00:22:33,581
(The dancing signature has begun.)

617
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:34,681
She just wrote "J".

618
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:36,251
- She's writing "I" next. - There it is.

619
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:37,651
- That makes "Jee". - "Jee".

620
00:22:37,651 --> 00:22:39,381
But isn't this a bit scary?

621
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:42,251
I didn't know I would get to see this again here.

622
00:22:42,381 --> 00:22:43,681
This is starting to scare me now.

623
00:22:43,681 --> 00:22:44,981
- She just turned. Goodness. - I saw this last year.

624
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:47,951
(He's trembling.)

625
00:22:48,181 --> 00:22:50,221
She is like So Min. She is indeed.

626
00:22:50,421 --> 00:22:52,221
She is similar to So Min.

627
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:53,551
- I completely agree. - Oh, my.

628
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:56,321
But everyone can figure out which letter she's writing though.

629
00:22:56,621 --> 00:22:57,681
(Squeaky)

630
00:22:57,951 --> 00:22:58,951
What was that?

631
00:22:59,781 --> 00:23:00,951
(What's up with her leg?)

632
00:23:00,951 --> 00:23:02,121
- What was that? - What was that?

633
00:23:02,121 --> 00:23:03,651
Don't dogs pee like that?

634
00:23:03,651 --> 00:23:05,921
- No, they don't. - I think they do.

635
00:23:05,921 --> 00:23:08,121
She just put a period. She's letting us know it's over.

636
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:09,781
- A period? - She was putting a period.

637
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:14,181
(Her spirit of art begins to heighten.)

638
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:18,251
(She puts a period powerfully.)

639
00:23:19,251 --> 00:23:21,381
(Who will beat her in the dance battle?)

640
00:23:21,381 --> 00:23:23,621
- You all saw her dance, right? - We will challenge her.

641
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:24,681
- Let's get the next one. - Jin Young.

642
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:26,621
- Why did you say it like that? - Let's challenge the next one.

643
00:23:27,321 --> 00:23:29,421
Let's do the next one. No, Jin Young. Let's not.

644
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:31,081
- Let's do the next one. - Then I will challenge this one.

645
00:23:31,081 --> 00:23:32,151
We can challenge the next one.

646
00:23:32,151 --> 00:23:34,381
- I'll do that too. Don't worry. - You'll challenge every battle?

647
00:23:34,381 --> 00:23:36,021
"If you want me to do it, I won't."

648
00:23:36,021 --> 00:23:39,021
- "I'll do if you don't want me to." - Okay. Let's try this.

649
00:23:39,021 --> 00:23:40,421
Whose name will you write?

650
00:23:41,051 --> 00:23:42,681
- I'll write Jong Kook's. - All right.

651
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:43,721
- Will you be okay? - This is great.

652
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:44,821
What's happening?

653
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:47,151
(Waving gently)

654
00:23:47,151 --> 00:23:49,581
- She's going to be great. - What was that?

655
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:52,151
Oh, dear. Hold on.

656
00:23:52,521 --> 00:23:53,681
- She's going at it. - Wait.

657
00:23:54,121 --> 00:23:56,881
- The viewers are as young as 12. - They are.

658
00:23:57,251 --> 00:24:00,551
(Children watch our show. So this is a bit...)

659
00:24:00,551 --> 00:24:01,751
(My family felt uncomfortable.)

660
00:24:01,751 --> 00:24:03,051
Jin Young, this is rated PG-12.

661
00:24:03,051 --> 00:24:04,521
- What's wrong with my dance? - Please tone it down.

662
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,121
- Since young kids watch this too... - What did I do wrong?

663
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:08,321
What did I do wrong?

664
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,851
The dance was beautiful, but it just had a weird vibe.

665
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:13,051
Young kids can watch the show. Let this go, and let's try the next one.

666
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:14,951
- Okay. - As expected, Jin Young...

667
00:24:14,951 --> 00:24:17,621
- can't hold back her talents. - I agree. She was amazing.

668
00:24:17,621 --> 00:24:20,581
Okay. Yeo Eun will show you another dance.

669
00:24:20,581 --> 00:24:23,321
She will show you the best dance.

670
00:24:23,521 --> 00:24:25,451
She has done the dance expressing the name before.

671
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:27,451
- I'll do a different dance. - That's right.

672
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:30,381
- She's going to dance barefoot? - Right.

673
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:31,781
- She won't back down. - A skirt?

674
00:24:32,021 --> 00:24:33,351
If you dance barefoot...

675
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:34,451
(The song plays.)

676
00:24:34,451 --> 00:24:36,251
I will do a different version of the dance.

677
00:24:36,251 --> 00:24:37,821
It's the same song, but a different dance.

678
00:24:41,151 --> 00:24:42,651
(Squeaky)

679
00:24:43,321 --> 00:24:45,651
- Did she start? - She's so serious.

680
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,221
(From the start, the moves of her modern dance is intense.)

681
00:24:49,381 --> 00:24:51,451
(Dancing lively)

682
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:54,021
I really think her personality is similar to yours.

683
00:24:54,181 --> 00:24:55,521
I'm so scared.

684
00:24:56,081 --> 00:24:58,481
- I mean... - Stop talking.

685
00:24:58,481 --> 00:25:01,251
- Is it supposed to be like this? - Yes, it is. Stay quiet!

686
00:25:01,721 --> 00:25:03,121
I'm so scared.

687
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:05,681
(Is she Yeo Eun or Ju-on?)

688
00:25:05,681 --> 00:25:07,821
- She'll dance. Let her be. - Stay out of this.

689
00:25:07,821 --> 00:25:09,321
(Is she a zombie?)

690
00:25:09,881 --> 00:25:11,251
- Let her be. - Stay out of this.

691
00:25:11,251 --> 00:25:12,251
(Roaring)

692
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:14,021
- She's good. - Give her the money.

693
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:16,021
- Yeo Eun, you are good. - Please stop dancing.

694
00:25:16,221 --> 00:25:19,381
- All right. You are good. - Stop dancing. What is this?

695
00:25:19,381 --> 00:25:20,821
I can't watch this anymore.

696
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:22,451
- You were great. - You were amazing, Yeo Eun.

697
00:25:22,451 --> 00:25:23,621
You were awesome.

698
00:25:23,621 --> 00:25:25,181
- I agree. - You all saw it, right?

699
00:25:25,181 --> 00:25:26,351
You are the best dancer.

700
00:25:26,351 --> 00:25:28,221
(Everyone agrees she is the best dancer.)

701
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:30,051
She is so similar to So Min.

702
00:25:30,051 --> 00:25:31,951
- She is? - Yes.

703
00:25:31,951 --> 00:25:33,021
She's your other self.

704
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:35,721
Right now, So Min, when you saw her dance,

705
00:25:35,721 --> 00:25:37,221
what did you think?

706
00:25:37,221 --> 00:25:39,521
- It was fun to watch. - Really?

707
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:41,321
(Yeo Eun is so much fun.)

708
00:25:41,321 --> 00:25:42,851
Stop lying. You said she was weird.

709
00:25:42,851 --> 00:25:44,521
She is so funny.

710
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:46,921
You are the weirdest member. Yet, you said she was weird.

711
00:25:47,951 --> 00:25:50,121
- You are ridiculous. - I saw the look on your face.

712
00:25:50,681 --> 00:25:54,121
Yeo Eun got the Best Dance!

713
00:25:57,551 --> 00:25:59,581
Next up is the Best Magnet.

714
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:02,081
So Min, you are saying you are the magnet.

715
00:26:02,081 --> 00:26:05,521
- Right. - Metal sticks onto me.

716
00:26:05,521 --> 00:26:07,681
- Where can they stick? - On my forehead and face.

717
00:26:07,681 --> 00:26:09,921
If you are not confident, don't try.

718
00:26:09,921 --> 00:26:12,121
- Let us have this one. - First, show us.

719
00:26:12,121 --> 00:26:13,851
- How can things get stuck? - Where do they stick?

720
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:15,521
- They can get stuck on her face. - Really?

721
00:26:15,521 --> 00:26:17,751
She's like a magnet. Everything just sticks onto her.

722
00:26:19,321 --> 00:26:22,121
(Really? It didn't stick.)

723
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:24,021
- It fell right away. - It just fell from her face.

724
00:26:24,021 --> 00:26:26,181
- How can it fall right away? - Go and sweat.

725
00:26:26,521 --> 00:26:27,951
- No. - Is it stuck?

726
00:26:27,951 --> 00:26:29,821
- It's stuck. - Dance and try it.

727
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,751
- I don't have to. - Everyone can do that.

728
00:26:31,751 --> 00:26:32,821
(She put 2 coins.)

729
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:34,781
She's not sweating. How is it possible?

730
00:26:34,781 --> 00:26:36,181
Everyone can do that much.

731
00:26:36,181 --> 00:26:38,221
(That's interesting. Is this possible?)

732
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,221
She's not sweating. How is it possible?

733
00:26:39,221 --> 00:26:41,381
- Wait. Let her try this first. - She put more?

734
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:42,751
(Is this possible?)

735
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:43,951
I can do it too.

736
00:26:44,781 --> 00:26:45,981
I can do it too.

737
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:49,721
- Hold on a minute. - If both of you can do it... Wait.

738
00:26:49,721 --> 00:26:51,921
- Ji Hyo can do it too. - If both of you can do this...

739
00:26:52,021 --> 00:26:53,321
Whoever puts more wins.

740
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:54,951
Whoever puts more will win.

741
00:26:54,951 --> 00:26:56,381
Everything can stick onto her face.

742
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,851
- A spoon can stick on your face? - A spoon?

743
00:26:57,851 --> 00:26:58,851
(How about this?)

744
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,051
No way.

745
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:01,451
Is she supernatural?

746
00:27:01,481 --> 00:27:03,081
Oh, my! She's the magnet!

747
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:05,451
(Oh, my! She's the magnet!)

748
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:07,681
Gosh, I just got goose bumps.

749
00:27:07,681 --> 00:27:09,081
(That is so interesting.)

750
00:27:09,081 --> 00:27:10,251
How can that stick on your face?

751
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:12,251
- How can it stick on your face? - I can do it too.

752
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:15,481
(Why are you trying to ruin our chances?)

753
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:17,021
Hold on a minute. I think...

754
00:27:17,021 --> 00:27:18,121
She can do it too!

755
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:20,021
- Na Eun can do it too. - It sticks on Na Eun's face too.

756
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:21,681
Everyone can do it? No way.

757
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,681
(She's in trouble.)

758
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:24,151
Everyone, she's the magnet.

759
00:27:24,221 --> 00:27:25,621
So Min is nervous now.

760
00:27:25,621 --> 00:27:27,151
No one can do this one.

761
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:28,551
Go, Magnet!

762
00:27:28,551 --> 00:27:31,851
- There's a zone. - There is?

763
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:33,351
- It's the magnet zone. - I guess there's a zone.

764
00:27:33,581 --> 00:27:37,451
There is a zone where people can put a spoon on their faces?

765
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:39,381
I am so surprised that Ji Hyo can do this too.

766
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:42,751
Channel your energy.

767
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:43,951
(She isn't unique.)

768
00:27:43,951 --> 00:27:46,251
- This one... - You can hang it on your bone?

769
00:27:46,251 --> 00:27:47,321
No.

770
00:27:47,321 --> 00:27:49,621
- This won't get stuck on her face. - Give her the ladle.

771
00:27:53,481 --> 00:27:57,721
(What is this magnetic chin?)

772
00:27:58,081 --> 00:27:59,251
What just happened?

773
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:01,021
What on earth is this?

774
00:28:01,151 --> 00:28:03,081
She's the magnet!

775
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,421
- This... - Please show us one more time.

776
00:28:05,421 --> 00:28:08,351
(Heroes always show up in times of crisis.)

777
00:28:08,351 --> 00:28:09,551
She's the magnet. This is amazing.

778
00:28:09,551 --> 00:28:10,821
Which of you can do this?

779
00:28:11,181 --> 00:28:13,681
If no one can do this, So Min wins. Sun Bin.

780
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:16,221
- You can't do this. - I can put the coin on my face...

781
00:28:17,981 --> 00:28:19,051
She's the magnet!

782
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:21,551
(Even if I dance, it's still on my face.)

783
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:22,551
What's with you?

784
00:28:22,551 --> 00:28:23,851
She's the magnet!

785
00:28:23,851 --> 00:28:25,621
Can you dance to "New Face"? All right.

786
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:26,851
She's the magnet!

787
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:28,781
(Since you are dancing...)

788
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:30,351
Please move back.

789
00:28:30,651 --> 00:28:32,051
Dance to the song to seal the deal.

790
00:28:32,381 --> 00:28:35,551
You just need to have the coin on your face and dance to the song.

791
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:37,221
All right. Play the song.

792
00:28:37,221 --> 00:28:39,081
- You are like a super hero. - Play the song, please.

793
00:28:39,081 --> 00:28:40,551
- You are... - This is so funny.

794
00:28:40,951 --> 00:28:42,021
You are skillful.

795
00:28:42,381 --> 00:28:43,481
Is it on her face?

796
00:28:44,481 --> 00:28:47,421
Here she is, the magnet!

797
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:49,181
(The magnet is on the move.)

798
00:28:49,321 --> 00:28:50,781
(You are so cool!)

799
00:28:51,851 --> 00:28:53,851
Gosh, I just lost all affection for her.

800
00:28:53,951 --> 00:28:54,981
I mean it.

801
00:28:55,481 --> 00:28:58,421
- I really don't want to see you. - So Min, you did it!

802
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:00,381
- Why? - I'm sorry, but don't come near me.

803
00:29:00,381 --> 00:29:01,451
(Humans are afraid of heroes.)

804
00:29:01,451 --> 00:29:04,721
We did it. Who'll challenge this? Even if they can, they can't try it.

805
00:29:05,181 --> 00:29:07,021
Who wants to challenge? Na Eun, can you do this?

806
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:08,421
Everyone, don't try it!

807
00:29:08,851 --> 00:29:10,151
Please don't do it!

808
00:29:10,451 --> 00:29:11,851
Na Eun, don't try it.

809
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:13,351
I'll give you 20 dollars. Stop it!

810
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:15,781
Can you dance with the spoon? Play the song, please.

811
00:29:15,781 --> 00:29:16,951
- She's amazing. - Play the song.

812
00:29:16,951 --> 00:29:18,621
(She can dance with the spoon too?)

813
00:29:18,621 --> 00:29:19,681
What's wrong with her?

814
00:29:21,221 --> 00:29:24,321
(The power of the magnet is on!)

815
00:29:25,481 --> 00:29:29,121
(Look at me, you humans!)

816
00:29:30,221 --> 00:29:32,151
- Stop. We won! - Do this move.

817
00:29:32,151 --> 00:29:33,221
(She's the magnet.)

818
00:29:33,221 --> 00:29:36,021
We won't challenge you! Fine, we won't do it!

819
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:38,381
- Unbelievable. - That was too much.

820
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,821
We did it!

821
00:29:40,151 --> 00:29:41,781
She's the magnet!

822
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:42,821
(So Min is Best Magnet.)

823
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:45,151
- No one can do it, right? - So Min is Best Magnet.

824
00:29:45,151 --> 00:29:46,251
(Even paper sticks too.)

825
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,451
She's unbelievable.

826
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:49,821
Is today's episode about crazy celebrities?

827
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,881
I mean, we were aware of her unique personality.

828
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:54,721
Now, who is next?

829
00:29:54,721 --> 00:29:56,781
- Jong Kook? - It's Best Cuteness.

830
00:29:56,781 --> 00:29:58,681
- Best Cuteness? - Yes.

831
00:29:58,781 --> 00:29:59,881
Smile.

832
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:02,081
It's Best Cuteness.

833
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:04,981
I mean, Jin Young can...

834
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:06,881
pull off the best cute acts in Korea.

835
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:09,121
- She is. - She's the best in the world.

836
00:30:09,121 --> 00:30:11,321
Jin Young, can you show us a few acts?

837
00:30:11,321 --> 00:30:12,321
Sure.

838
00:30:12,681 --> 00:30:13,921
You.

839
00:30:14,121 --> 00:30:16,081
I'm so happy today that I could faint.

840
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:17,651
(Disturbed)

841
00:30:20,121 --> 00:30:22,251
Jong Kook feels uncomfortable. He really does.

842
00:30:22,251 --> 00:30:24,321
- He can't stand watching them. - Hey, Jong Kook.

843
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:25,951
- You should respond to it. - I did.

844
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:27,551
- As I told you, - I did though.

845
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:28,721
- you should exchange... - I'm sorry,

846
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:31,781
but she's lucky that I didn't butt my head.

847
00:30:32,151 --> 00:30:33,251
(They are certainly different.)

848
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:34,651
- I smiled. - You have to reciprocate.

849
00:30:34,651 --> 00:30:36,481
- Please do another one. - You have to do the same for her.

850
00:30:36,481 --> 00:30:38,481
- I played along though. - We should do it together.

851
00:30:38,481 --> 00:30:40,851
For you to prove she has the best cute acts, we need to verify.

852
00:30:40,851 --> 00:30:41,851
I have to do it too?

853
00:30:41,851 --> 00:30:44,151
- You should do the same acts. - I agree.

854
00:30:44,151 --> 00:30:45,951
- I should do it too? - You should follow her.

855
00:30:45,951 --> 00:30:48,451
- Let's do it together. - Exactly. You should exchange them.

856
00:30:48,451 --> 00:30:49,481
I agree.

857
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:51,381
Here you go.

858
00:30:51,681 --> 00:30:53,251
You, Jong Kook.

859
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:55,851
(Unable to talk)

860
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:58,521
- We can't accept this. - It's unacceptable.

861
00:30:58,521 --> 00:31:00,251
It's not that. Why do I have to do this too?

862
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:02,621
- We'll lose because of you. - She wrote this down!

863
00:31:02,951 --> 00:31:04,351
- Did I tell her to write this? - You have to respond.

864
00:31:04,351 --> 00:31:06,481
- She said she was best at it. - You need to play along.

865
00:31:06,481 --> 00:31:07,751
- How many times... - You have to reciprocate.

866
00:31:07,751 --> 00:31:08,951
You two are a couple now.

867
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:10,421
- Come on. - You have to say, "You, Jin Young".

868
00:31:10,421 --> 00:31:12,221
- Just do it. - Do the same act.

869
00:31:12,221 --> 00:31:13,351
Please do it again.

870
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:14,481
(We ought to do this.)

871
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:16,251
- Do it well since you are doing it. - Of course. I should do it.

872
00:31:16,851 --> 00:31:19,421
(Do it well since you are doing it anyway.)

873
00:31:19,551 --> 00:31:20,551
(Frightened)

874
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:21,751
I got it.

875
00:31:22,121 --> 00:31:23,521
You, Jong Kook.

876
00:31:23,621 --> 00:31:24,821
You.

877
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:26,421
I'm so happy today that I could faint.

878
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:27,921
(Follow me!)

879
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:29,121
I faint.

880
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:30,351
(He really wants to faint.)

881
00:31:30,351 --> 00:31:32,251
- It's the last one. - I want to faint.

882
00:31:34,551 --> 00:31:36,581
(He can't manage well.)

883
00:31:36,581 --> 00:31:37,751
(This won't be replayed.)

884
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:39,551
- Is 10 dollars worth it? - Goodness.

885
00:31:39,821 --> 00:31:41,181
What will you do?

886
00:31:41,181 --> 00:31:42,381
Ji Hyo, you.

887
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:46,451
(He lowers himself to listen to Ji Hyo.)

888
00:31:47,321 --> 00:31:49,221
He lowered himself when she whispered.

889
00:31:49,221 --> 00:31:50,521
That's really nice.

890
00:31:50,521 --> 00:31:52,451
This is also acting cute.

891
00:31:52,451 --> 00:31:54,121
- This is it. - I love it.

892
00:31:55,051 --> 00:31:56,481
- Are you jealous? - Just smile.

893
00:31:58,021 --> 00:31:59,621
That's funny.

894
00:31:59,621 --> 00:32:01,721
(You lose if you're jealous.)

895
00:32:02,551 --> 00:32:03,981
(Whispering)

896
00:32:03,981 --> 00:32:05,021
He's so polite.

897
00:32:05,851 --> 00:32:06,981
He's so polite.

898
00:32:06,981 --> 00:32:08,381
(Can they act cute?)

899
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:11,581
- If you won't do it, stop it. - We will.

900
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:13,581
- It's nothing. - What are you doing?

901
00:32:13,821 --> 00:32:14,981
We don't have time right now.

902
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:15,981
We're making a plan.

903
00:32:15,981 --> 00:32:17,981
- We have to go in the water. - Hurry up.

904
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:19,651
- Just do it. - Okay.

905
00:32:20,081 --> 00:32:21,251
- We'll start. - Go.

906
00:32:21,721 --> 00:32:22,921
Ji Hyo.

907
00:32:22,921 --> 00:32:25,521
I had a scary dream,

908
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:26,851
so buy me some beef.

909
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:28,181
Shall I?

910
00:32:28,651 --> 00:32:30,951
- Tae Hwan, you. - Ji Hyo, you.

911
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:32,781
Go away, both of you.

912
00:32:33,981 --> 00:32:35,051
Go away!

913
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:37,781
What's wrong? Weren't we cute?

914
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:40,821
Weren't we so cute that you wanted to bite us?

915
00:32:42,151 --> 00:32:44,181
Aren't we irresistibly cute?

916
00:32:44,221 --> 00:32:45,451
(She acts boldly.)

917
00:32:45,481 --> 00:32:46,481
For now,

918
00:32:46,481 --> 00:32:48,751
both of you did your best,

919
00:32:48,751 --> 00:32:51,921
but no one can act as cute as Jin Young.

920
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:53,551
- Does anyone want to try? - I do.

921
00:32:53,881 --> 00:32:55,681
Yeo Eun wants to do it.

922
00:32:56,121 --> 00:32:58,521
You're so shameless.

923
00:32:58,651 --> 00:33:00,581
I've never seen anyone like her.

924
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:03,221
Will you participate in everything?

925
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:05,581
That sounds good. Let's take a look.

926
00:33:05,581 --> 00:33:06,681
I'll speak with an accent.

927
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:07,981
- This is great. - I'll speak with a Busan accent.

928
00:33:07,981 --> 00:33:09,621
- She's from Busan. - This is good.

929
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,421
- This is it. - I don't know this one.

930
00:33:11,521 --> 00:33:14,251
It's game over if she says, "honey".

931
00:33:14,981 --> 00:33:16,321
- Shall I start? - Go ahead.

932
00:33:17,381 --> 00:33:19,851
Honey, I really like you.

933
00:33:19,851 --> 00:33:21,251
Will you marry me?

934
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:23,251
Let's get married, honey.

935
00:33:24,221 --> 00:33:25,451
Whom are you talking to?

936
00:33:26,081 --> 00:33:27,351
Wasn't she...

937
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:28,681
talking to a ghost?

938
00:33:28,981 --> 00:33:30,321
She was...

939
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:32,481
- talking to a ghost. - Stop it.

940
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:34,581
- Try it again. - She saw a ghost.

941
00:33:34,821 --> 00:33:35,881
Did you see a ghost?

942
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:37,581
- Is this real? - Yes.

943
00:33:37,781 --> 00:33:39,581
She talked to an empty space.

944
00:33:39,581 --> 00:33:40,981
It's very scary.

945
00:33:40,981 --> 00:33:43,951
"Honey, will you marry me?"

946
00:33:43,951 --> 00:33:45,221
Was she talking to a ghost?

947
00:33:45,221 --> 00:33:47,381
- She frightened me. - Wait.

948
00:33:47,521 --> 00:33:49,781
"Honey, will you marry me?"

949
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:52,151
- "Honey." - She'll do something else.

950
00:33:52,151 --> 00:33:53,651
- Honey. - Honey.

951
00:33:53,651 --> 00:33:54,781
That's it.

952
00:33:54,781 --> 00:33:56,081
She has something else.

953
00:33:56,081 --> 00:33:58,521
Watch, Jin Young. You won't win 10 dollars.

954
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:00,521
We have something else.

955
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:01,781
It's an improved version.

956
00:34:02,521 --> 00:34:03,581
Go.

957
00:34:04,081 --> 00:34:05,621
Honey.

958
00:34:05,621 --> 00:34:09,221
(It sounds eerie.)

959
00:34:10,021 --> 00:34:11,251
She talks to ghosts.

960
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:12,981
She really talks to ghosts.

961
00:34:12,981 --> 00:34:14,681
- Good job. - It's scary.

962
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:15,721
- Honey. - That was good.

963
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,221
I'd rather go to the Labyrinth.

964
00:34:17,421 --> 00:34:19,151
- Listen, raise your hands. - She's scarier.

965
00:34:19,151 --> 00:34:20,591
You never know.

966
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:22,351
- "Honey." - "Honey."

967
00:34:23,151 --> 00:34:24,321
Guess what?

968
00:34:24,951 --> 00:34:27,751
- That's enough. - Stop it.

969
00:34:27,751 --> 00:34:30,021
- Stop it. That's enough. - She acts like a ghost.

970
00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:33,481
- I bet it'll become very popular. - May I try it?

971
00:34:33,481 --> 00:34:34,681
Raise your hands.

972
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:37,651
Will it be Jin Young or Yeo Eun?

973
00:34:38,351 --> 00:34:40,351
Raise your hand if Jin Young was better.

974
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:42,521
- Yeo Eun was good. - How about Yeo Eun?

975
00:34:42,521 --> 00:34:43,621
- Why? - Great.

976
00:34:43,621 --> 00:34:44,881
It's supposed to be acting cute.

977
00:34:45,151 --> 00:34:47,721
- It's about acting cute. - You have to improve yourself.

978
00:34:47,721 --> 00:34:48,721
This is acting cute.

979
00:34:48,721 --> 00:34:50,751
Honey, will you drink it in one go?

980
00:34:50,751 --> 00:34:52,921
Yeo Eun is better.

981
00:34:54,121 --> 00:34:55,251
I was kidding.

982
00:34:56,421 --> 00:34:58,251
- Who agrees with him? - Jin Young?

983
00:34:58,251 --> 00:34:59,921
I don't like to drink,

984
00:34:59,921 --> 00:35:02,181
but I have a few for drinking.

985
00:35:02,181 --> 00:35:03,181
Sing with me.

986
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:07,451
On the outskirts of a village, take a shot.

987
00:35:07,551 --> 00:35:11,351
And 21 shots

988
00:35:12,021 --> 00:35:13,321
I'm sorry.

989
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:14,721
Our viewers are as young as 12.

990
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:17,151
Listen.

991
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:18,451
Seriously.

992
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:20,521
Everyone froze with their arms in mid-air.

993
00:35:21,181 --> 00:35:25,351
On the outskirts of a village, take a shot.

994
00:35:26,421 --> 00:35:29,921
(Everyone freezes.)

995
00:35:32,151 --> 00:35:34,481
Fathers covered their children's eyes while watching TV.

996
00:35:34,481 --> 00:35:36,251
(It's not for children.)

997
00:35:37,421 --> 00:35:38,621
For Best Cuteness,

998
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:40,781
Jin Young and Jong Kook win.

999
00:35:40,781 --> 00:35:42,051
(They’re 1st place.)

1000
00:35:42,051 --> 00:35:43,421
Good job, Jin Young.

1001
00:35:43,421 --> 00:35:45,781
Next is the winner of Best Hands.

1002
00:35:45,781 --> 00:35:47,251
(Ji Hyo places 1st for Best Hands.)

1003
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:48,251
Do you do whatever you want?

1004
00:35:48,251 --> 00:35:50,351
(She easily passes Flushing the Toilet.)

1005
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:53,451
(Water splashes on Na Eun.)

1006
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,121
- It's over. - Already?

1007
00:35:55,121 --> 00:35:56,181
Is it over already?

1008
00:35:56,181 --> 00:35:57,721
You're so lucky, Ji Hyo.

1009
00:35:57,951 --> 00:35:59,751
Next is the winner of Best Waist.

1010
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:00,981
(Na Eun places 1st.)

1011
00:36:00,981 --> 00:36:02,451
Her waist is so narrow.

1012
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,591
She needs another hole to fit.

1013
00:36:04,591 --> 00:36:06,381
(Her waist is as narrow as her wrist.)

1014
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:07,421
My goodness.

1015
00:36:08,091 --> 00:36:09,591
If she fits in the next hole,

1016
00:36:10,351 --> 00:36:12,051
then she wins.

1017
00:36:12,051 --> 00:36:14,091
- She fits. - It's the 24th hole.

1018
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:16,221
(Her waist is 19in.)

1019
00:36:17,121 --> 00:36:18,681
Na Eun wins.

1020
00:36:18,681 --> 00:36:20,121
(Na Eun places 1st for Best Waist.)

1021
00:36:20,121 --> 00:36:21,421
Who's the winner of Best Eyes?

1022
00:36:21,421 --> 00:36:22,621
Get ready, set, go.

1023
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,821
Tae Hwan is good.

1024
00:36:24,821 --> 00:36:26,181
Ha Young is also good.

1025
00:36:26,181 --> 00:36:27,251
(They compete.)

1026
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:30,051
- What's going on? - Look at his eyes.

1027
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:32,121
- He's amazing. - He blinked.

1028
00:36:32,121 --> 00:36:35,821
(Ha Young places 1st for Best Eyes.)

1029
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:39,051
They won what they said they would.

1030
00:36:39,051 --> 00:36:40,251
(Each wins 10 dollars.)

1031
00:36:40,421 --> 00:36:41,981
This is the last round.

1032
00:36:41,981 --> 00:36:43,481
Will you place 1st for Best Punch?

1033
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:44,551
- Yes. - Is there Best Punch?

1034
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:46,021
This is simple.

1035
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:48,221
Your power will be measured by the machine.

1036
00:36:48,221 --> 00:36:50,181
(Can you punch?)

1037
00:36:50,381 --> 00:36:51,591
Who wants to try it?

1038
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:52,881
Our magnet will try it.

1039
00:36:52,881 --> 00:36:54,821
(So Min goes first.)

1040
00:36:54,821 --> 00:36:56,591
He makes me do everything.

1041
00:36:56,591 --> 00:36:58,381
- So Min will try. - Here's our magnet.

1042
00:36:58,381 --> 00:36:59,851
- She can do it. - I bet she can do it.

1043
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:00,851
Try it.

1044
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,221
She might be stronger.

1045
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,551
Our magnet will go first.

1046
00:37:03,981 --> 00:37:05,521
I make a fist.

1047
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:06,821
It's the basic in fighting.

1048
00:37:07,251 --> 00:37:09,121
- You want me to keep it on? - Stop it.

1049
00:37:09,251 --> 00:37:11,021
- She's our magnet. - Stop it.

1050
00:37:11,051 --> 00:37:13,721
Next is Sun Bin.

1051
00:37:13,851 --> 00:37:15,851
Those who want to challenge can go first,

1052
00:37:15,851 --> 00:37:17,751
- and Sun Bin will go last. - Okay.

1053
00:37:17,751 --> 00:37:19,351
Hold right here.

1054
00:37:19,591 --> 00:37:20,721
She's the magnet.

1055
00:37:20,921 --> 00:37:22,921
- Hold it. - She can't steal my 10 dollars.

1056
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:24,721
(So Min takes her pose.)

1057
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:25,751
Here's So Min.

1058
00:37:26,221 --> 00:37:27,451
I like So Min.

1059
00:37:29,321 --> 00:37:33,051
(She throws a nice punch.)

1060
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:34,051
Goodness.

1061
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:35,621
It must be a high score.

1062
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:39,851
(Will Sun Bin be defeated from the start?)

1063
00:37:39,851 --> 00:37:41,351
It's 402.

1064
00:37:41,351 --> 00:37:43,951
(402 is a high score.)

1065
00:37:44,751 --> 00:37:46,551
- You scored 402. - It's 402.

1066
00:37:47,021 --> 00:37:48,781
Next is Na Eun.

1067
00:37:48,951 --> 00:37:50,021
Will you try?

1068
00:37:50,021 --> 00:37:52,321
- You can stand there. - Be careful, Na Eun.

1069
00:37:52,321 --> 00:37:53,921
Stand right here.

1070
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:54,921
What is it?

1071
00:37:54,921 --> 00:37:56,681
Are you working for her?

1072
00:37:57,521 --> 00:37:58,751
- Yes. - Right.

1073
00:37:58,751 --> 00:37:59,921
You escort her.

1074
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:01,421
They don't seem like a couple.

1075
00:38:01,551 --> 00:38:03,251
- He's her butler. - I'm her butler.

1076
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:06,351
He's either her bodyguard, butler, or servant.

1077
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:08,881
Do you know what's funny about Na Eun?

1078
00:38:08,981 --> 00:38:11,881
Instead of stopping Se Chan and telling him to be comfortable,

1079
00:38:11,881 --> 00:38:13,451
- she naturally accepts it. - She does.

1080
00:38:14,151 --> 00:38:16,351
- Pretty women know. - She accepts it.

1081
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:18,621
You should punch like this.

1082
00:38:18,621 --> 00:38:20,721
That's it.

1083
00:38:20,721 --> 00:38:21,921
She punched.

1084
00:38:22,821 --> 00:38:24,351
(We'll consider that as her punch.)

1085
00:38:24,351 --> 00:38:26,951
- No. - Stop it.

1086
00:38:26,951 --> 00:38:29,881
Her score is 20. That was it.

1087
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:31,221
That was it.

1088
00:38:31,521 --> 00:38:32,951
You already punched.

1089
00:38:33,221 --> 00:38:34,681
You got your score. Go back in.

1090
00:38:34,681 --> 00:38:35,781
- Go back. - Go back.

1091
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:36,921
Good job, Na Eun.

1092
00:38:36,921 --> 00:38:38,551
(Se Chan compliments her.)

1093
00:38:38,551 --> 00:38:40,551
You can punch harder next time.

1094
00:38:41,221 --> 00:38:43,091
Punch harder next time. It wasn't bad.

1095
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:45,681
(Na Eun fails in her attempt.)

1096
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:47,721
They are...

1097
00:38:47,721 --> 00:38:49,451
the couple of darkness.

1098
00:38:50,151 --> 00:38:51,351
You don't need to go far.

1099
00:38:51,451 --> 00:38:52,781
I bet Jin Young will be good.

1100
00:38:53,151 --> 00:38:55,481
Take one step, and punch...

1101
00:38:55,481 --> 00:38:56,821
from the side. Try it.

1102
00:38:56,881 --> 00:38:58,381
Approach from the side.

1103
00:38:58,381 --> 00:39:00,591
Otherwise, you'll bump in here. Do it from the side.

1104
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:02,091
Turn your body to the side.

1105
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:03,721
- Turn it like this. - I got it.

1106
00:39:03,721 --> 00:39:05,751
(She gets annoyed.)

1107
00:39:06,381 --> 00:39:09,151
This couple doesn't seem decent.

1108
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:10,721
Don't they seem indecent?

1109
00:39:10,721 --> 00:39:13,681
- Stop saying that. - Don't say that.

1110
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:16,251
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it. - Thank you.

1111
00:39:17,151 --> 00:39:19,321
Use your weight to punch, okay?

1112
00:39:19,321 --> 00:39:20,621
I bet her punch is strong.

1113
00:39:22,221 --> 00:39:23,651
She seems most dangerous.

1114
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:26,681
- Her punch must be strong. - Please move aside a bit.

1115
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:28,781
- I'll be here. - Exceed 402 points.

1116
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:29,881
(Everyone stays focused.)

1117
00:39:31,981 --> 00:39:38,091
(She prepares her punch carefully.)

1118
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:42,821
(What will be charismatic Jin Young's score?)

1119
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:43,981
(She misses.)

1120
00:39:45,221 --> 00:39:47,451
(She misses her punch.)

1121
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,451
I'm glad I was here.

1122
00:39:48,451 --> 00:39:49,721
Does that count?

1123
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:52,591
- It does. - Her score is zero.

1124
00:39:52,981 --> 00:39:54,451
As you know,

1125
00:39:54,451 --> 00:39:56,091
Ji Hyo is strong.

1126
00:39:56,091 --> 00:39:57,821
- Ji Hyo is. - She is.

1127
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,321
- She seems like... - They look like...

1128
00:40:00,551 --> 00:40:03,681
a couple that you'd see in dramas.

1129
00:40:03,951 --> 00:40:05,091
Take a step first.

1130
00:40:05,251 --> 00:40:06,551
- Punch? - Right after the step.

1131
00:40:07,721 --> 00:40:09,121
He's good at teaching.

1132
00:40:09,591 --> 00:40:10,751
- Like this? - Yes.

1133
00:40:10,751 --> 00:40:13,981
Why do you ask when you know how to punch?

1134
00:40:13,981 --> 00:40:15,181
You don't need to practice.

1135
00:40:15,181 --> 00:40:17,251
- Let me try. - You've punched before.

1136
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:20,091
- Let me practice. - You've punched a lot before.

1137
00:40:20,091 --> 00:40:22,091
- Stop it. - Fine.

1138
00:40:22,251 --> 00:40:23,751
She used to kick instead.

1139
00:40:25,151 --> 00:40:26,751
(Be quiet.)

1140
00:40:27,951 --> 00:40:29,121
- Like this? - Yes.

1141
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:30,321
Don't get hurt.

1142
00:40:31,651 --> 00:40:32,821
That was great.

1143
00:40:32,821 --> 00:40:35,051
(Don't get hurt.)

1144
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:37,251
(He gasps.)

1145
00:40:37,481 --> 00:40:38,521
I knew it.

1146
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,151
It's 378.

1147
00:40:41,881 --> 00:40:42,921
It's 378.

1148
00:40:42,921 --> 00:40:44,621
You're in first place, So Min.

1149
00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:47,121
- The magnet lady is winning. - She is.

1150
00:40:48,621 --> 00:40:51,421
Sun Bin has to exceed 400 points.

1151
00:40:52,091 --> 00:40:53,521
- Let's go. - I was surprised.

1152
00:40:53,721 --> 00:40:54,721
Wish me luck.

1153
00:40:55,981 --> 00:40:58,881
- You know by the sound. - Let's see if she exceeds 400.

1154
00:40:59,091 --> 00:41:00,381
You can do it.

1155
00:41:00,381 --> 00:41:03,021
The winner is determined accurately by the score.

1156
00:41:03,121 --> 00:41:04,221
You only have one chance.

1157
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,251
(She only has one chance.)

1158
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:07,721
Why am I so nervous?

1159
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:10,421
(She must not feel too much pressure.)

1160
00:41:11,591 --> 00:41:14,821
(Kwang Soo, give me strength.)

1161
00:41:17,591 --> 00:41:22,781
(She flies like a butterfly...)

1162
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:26,151
(and stings like a bee.)

1163
00:41:26,181 --> 00:41:27,251
My goodness.

1164
00:41:28,591 --> 00:41:30,551
- That was nice. - Seriously.

1165
00:41:30,551 --> 00:41:33,521
(What will be Sun Bin's score?)

1166
00:41:33,521 --> 00:41:35,681
- It's 462. - Okay.

1167
00:41:35,681 --> 00:41:37,591
(She received a score of 462.)

1168
00:41:37,591 --> 00:41:39,981
(She places 1st with her punch.)

1169
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:42,091
She is different.

1170
00:41:44,051 --> 00:41:46,421
Sun Bin will take...

1171
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:47,951
- 10 dollars. - All right.

1172
00:41:47,951 --> 00:41:49,621
(She acquires 10 dollars with a punch on a different level.)

1173
00:41:49,621 --> 00:41:50,651
That was impressive.

1174
00:41:51,151 --> 00:41:52,181
How nice!

1175
00:41:53,591 --> 00:41:56,181
You have the money for the mission.

1176
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,681
Now, you will change into team uniforms...

1177
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,781
and start the mission in earnest.

1178
00:41:59,781 --> 00:42:01,351
- We are starting now. - This must be worth two episodes.

1179
00:42:03,251 --> 00:42:04,551
Let's go.

1180
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:05,551
(They will have more than enough for one episode.)

1181
00:42:06,321 --> 00:42:07,681
Should I keep it with me?

1182
00:42:07,681 --> 00:42:09,091
Yes.

1183
00:42:10,551 --> 00:42:14,051
(They go to the water park to avoid the heat.)

1184
00:42:14,351 --> 00:42:17,681
(What kind of a refreshing mission awaits them?)

1185
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:20,951
Let's hurry up and go.

1186
00:42:20,951 --> 00:42:22,651
(Let's go, honey!)

1187
00:42:22,651 --> 00:42:23,981
(Hurry up and do it.)

1188
00:42:23,981 --> 00:42:25,591
My goodness.

1189
00:42:25,681 --> 00:42:26,881
It smells like the sea.

1190
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:29,851
Why would the water park smell like the sea?

1191
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:31,981
For goodness' sake.

1192
00:42:31,981 --> 00:42:33,591
Is this your first time at a water park?

1193
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,781
Why would the water park smell like the sea?

1194
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:37,481
It smells like the sea.

1195
00:42:39,521 --> 00:42:41,421
- You're the Magnet Lady. - Yeo Eun.

1196
00:42:41,551 --> 00:42:44,321
Why are you tasting the water? It's not seawater.

1197
00:42:44,381 --> 00:42:46,951
So Min said that it smelled like the sea, right?

1198
00:42:46,951 --> 00:42:48,881
- Yes. - Yeo Eun tasted the water.

1199
00:42:48,881 --> 00:42:50,381
(So Min speaks, and Yeo Eun checks.)

1200
00:42:50,381 --> 00:42:51,591
She did that.

1201
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:53,381
It will be a disaster if they join forces.

1202
00:42:53,381 --> 00:42:55,921
- Pull them apart. - Look at them.

1203
00:42:55,951 --> 00:42:57,521
They look alike, too.

1204
00:42:57,521 --> 00:42:58,951
(Can you tell Yeo Eun and So Min apart?)

1205
00:42:59,781 --> 00:43:02,781
The first mission...

1206
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:04,551
will help you earn money for the future missions.

1207
00:43:04,621 --> 00:43:06,321
It's called Tools and Money.

1208
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:07,781
(Tools and Money)

1209
00:43:10,151 --> 00:43:11,551
Tools and Money?

1210
00:43:11,551 --> 00:43:13,021
Money!

1211
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,781
The 7 couples will be divided into 2 groups for a match.

1212
00:43:18,051 --> 00:43:20,091
As soon as the mission starts,

1213
00:43:20,321 --> 00:43:23,151
the men must choose 1 out of 4 mystery boxes...

1214
00:43:23,151 --> 00:43:25,551
on the flamingos,

1215
00:43:25,681 --> 00:43:29,451
and deliver the tools to their partners.

1216
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,921
After delivering the tools to their partners,

1217
00:43:31,921 --> 00:43:33,521
the men will sit with baskets over their heads.

1218
00:43:33,521 --> 00:43:35,881
After getting the tool,

1219
00:43:35,881 --> 00:43:39,251
the women will run to the well that is filled with gold coins...

1220
00:43:39,251 --> 00:43:40,251
and transfer them to the baskets.

1221
00:43:40,421 --> 00:43:43,521
The weight of gold coins will determine the amount of money.

1222
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:45,421
(10 cents per 1g will be given.)

1223
00:43:45,981 --> 00:43:46,981
All right.

1224
00:43:47,451 --> 00:43:49,551
- All right. - It's obvious that...

1225
00:43:49,781 --> 00:43:50,921
Ha Young...

1226
00:43:51,151 --> 00:43:53,351
is here for the shoot only.

1227
00:43:53,781 --> 00:43:55,251
She is determined to win.

1228
00:43:55,251 --> 00:43:56,951
She is here for the shoot only.

1229
00:43:56,951 --> 00:43:59,181
If there is a change in partners...

1230
00:43:59,181 --> 00:44:00,351
Stop it.

1231
00:44:00,781 --> 00:44:02,221
Stop it already.

1232
00:44:02,321 --> 00:44:04,081
Ha Young is stubborn.

1233
00:44:04,081 --> 00:44:05,621
She never loses hope.

1234
00:44:05,621 --> 00:44:07,551
I like that she is unchanging.

1235
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,451
I like that she is unchanging.

1236
00:44:09,451 --> 00:44:10,451
It's nice.

1237
00:44:11,381 --> 00:44:13,221
This is the first round of Tools and Money.

1238
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:15,351
The time limit is three minutes.

1239
00:44:15,521 --> 00:44:17,151
Let's go.

1240
00:44:17,151 --> 00:44:19,951
I can't believe I am standing next to Jong Kook.

1241
00:44:20,251 --> 00:44:21,581
(The toughest couple)

1242
00:44:21,581 --> 00:44:22,981
(Jong Kook and Jin Young)

1243
00:44:23,551 --> 00:44:24,881
I will be back.

1244
00:44:24,881 --> 00:44:26,051
(Between love and loyalty, Se Chan and Na Eun)

1245
00:44:26,481 --> 00:44:28,051
I don't think I will be able to run.

1246
00:44:28,051 --> 00:44:29,551
(The masters of dancing and hosting, Jae Seok and Yeo Eun)

1247
00:44:29,951 --> 00:44:32,621
- Can we switch partners later? - Stop it.

1248
00:44:32,621 --> 00:44:33,681
(The wrong encounter, Seok Jin and Ha Young)

1249
00:44:34,181 --> 00:44:36,181
Is everyone ready?

1250
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:37,881
(Fly like a bee...)

1251
00:44:37,881 --> 00:44:39,551
(to get the best tool.)

1252
00:44:39,981 --> 00:44:40,981
Get ready.

1253
00:44:41,781 --> 00:44:42,781
Set.

1254
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:44,351
(Tools and Money, the 1st round)

1255
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:45,621
My goodness.

1256
00:44:45,621 --> 00:44:46,781
(It starts.)

1257
00:44:46,781 --> 00:44:48,251
(Get out of the way, Seok Jin.)

1258
00:44:49,421 --> 00:44:51,151
(Get out of the way, Jae Seok.)

1259
00:44:52,621 --> 00:44:53,951
(Run)

1260
00:44:55,581 --> 00:44:58,781
(The desire to run is in the soul of Running Man.)

1261
00:44:58,781 --> 00:45:00,881
- Catch Jong Kook. - Catch him.

1262
00:45:00,881 --> 00:45:02,221
- Catch him. - Catch Jong Kook.

1263
00:45:03,081 --> 00:45:05,081
- Catch him. - Catch Jong Kook.

1264
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:11,381
(They clash in front of flamingo number 1.)

1265
00:45:12,721 --> 00:45:14,421
(Number 1 is mine.)

1266
00:45:15,581 --> 00:45:17,151
(Puffed grain snack?)

1267
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:20,451
(He needs another tool.)

1268
00:45:21,181 --> 00:45:23,981
(Otherwise, he will get scolded by Jin Young.)

1269
00:45:23,981 --> 00:45:25,951
(Don't block my path.)

1270
00:45:27,351 --> 00:45:30,651
(He beats the members who are no match for him, )

1271
00:45:32,681 --> 00:45:34,421
(and acquires a flipper.)

1272
00:45:34,421 --> 00:45:35,951
This is ridiculous.

1273
00:45:36,551 --> 00:45:41,081
(Jin Young, I did it.)

1274
00:45:41,081 --> 00:45:42,551
- Here you go. - Do I go now?

1275
00:45:42,551 --> 00:45:43,551
Yes.

1276
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,581
(Jin Young's gold rush begins.)

1277
00:45:44,781 --> 00:45:46,421
Hurry up.

1278
00:45:46,421 --> 00:45:47,551
(What are our partners doing?)

1279
00:45:48,051 --> 00:45:50,181
(Their partners...)

1280
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:51,181
My goodness.

1281
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:52,951
(They're fighting for a turner.)

1282
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:55,251
My goodness.

1283
00:45:55,251 --> 00:45:57,251
(I will pick another tool.)

1284
00:45:57,251 --> 00:45:58,421
My goodness.

1285
00:46:00,251 --> 00:46:02,051
(Is that puffed grain snack Jong Kook discarded?)

1286
00:46:02,781 --> 00:46:03,781
Come on.

1287
00:46:04,181 --> 00:46:06,551
(You can enjoy fighting. I am going to leave.)

1288
00:46:08,081 --> 00:46:11,151
(Give me the turner.)

1289
00:46:11,151 --> 00:46:14,781
(After failing to win the turner, which tool will Seok Jin get?)

1290
00:46:16,581 --> 00:46:18,481
(A scratcher?)

1291
00:46:19,581 --> 00:46:20,681
Here.

1292
00:46:20,681 --> 00:46:21,721
(The weaker contestants return.)

1293
00:46:21,721 --> 00:46:23,321
Use this.

1294
00:46:23,321 --> 00:46:24,981
What am I supposed to do with it?

1295
00:46:24,981 --> 00:46:27,521
- Take this. - Hurry up.

1296
00:46:27,521 --> 00:46:29,081
(How will she overcome this crisis?)

1297
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:30,151
Come on.

1298
00:46:30,151 --> 00:46:31,951
(How will she overcome this crisis?)

1299
00:46:31,951 --> 00:46:34,881
(How can Ha Young win with a scratcher?)

1300
00:46:36,621 --> 00:46:39,181
(She can use this method.)

1301
00:46:39,181 --> 00:46:42,251
(She uses the scratcher like a sword.)

1302
00:46:42,251 --> 00:46:44,551
My goodness.

1303
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:46,251
(They can't believe their eyes.)

1304
00:46:46,251 --> 00:46:48,381
She swung it.

1305
00:46:48,451 --> 00:46:49,581
My goodness.

1306
00:46:49,781 --> 00:46:51,951
(Screaming)

1307
00:46:51,951 --> 00:46:53,081
My goodness.

1308
00:46:53,621 --> 00:46:56,481
(Ha Young, the lawless)

1309
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,251
You could have done better...

1310
00:46:59,251 --> 00:47:00,351
with a flipper.

1311
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,351
Stop it.

1312
00:47:02,681 --> 00:47:06,251
(I will take 1st place and win the rings.)

1313
00:47:06,881 --> 00:47:09,221
You could have done better with a flipper.

1314
00:47:09,251 --> 00:47:10,251
Stop it.

1315
00:47:12,251 --> 00:47:14,151
(Puffed grain snack is delicious.)

1316
00:47:14,151 --> 00:47:15,881
- Come on. - Let's go.

1317
00:47:15,881 --> 00:47:17,821
You can do it.

1318
00:47:18,151 --> 00:47:19,151
Come on.

1319
00:47:19,321 --> 00:47:21,181
Hurry up.

1320
00:47:21,721 --> 00:47:23,781
Hurry up.

1321
00:47:23,781 --> 00:47:24,821
30 seconds remain.

1322
00:47:25,151 --> 00:47:26,681
You can't put coins in the bag.

1323
00:47:26,781 --> 00:47:28,251
You can't put coins in the bag.

1324
00:47:28,251 --> 00:47:29,381
(It's too delicious.)

1325
00:47:29,381 --> 00:47:30,621
Hurry up, Na Eun.

1326
00:47:30,621 --> 00:47:32,321
We don't have much time.

1327
00:47:33,051 --> 00:47:35,081
Na Eun, you need to hurry up.

1328
00:47:35,081 --> 00:47:36,251
(Se Chan, I think we are doomed.)

1329
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:39,781
(The real race starts with 30 seconds left on the clock.)

1330
00:47:39,781 --> 00:47:41,081
You can't use your hands.

1331
00:47:41,081 --> 00:47:42,381
Yeo Eun.

1332
00:47:42,381 --> 00:47:43,421
Hurry up, Na Eun.

1333
00:47:43,681 --> 00:47:45,421
Stop Jin Young from bringing more coins.

1334
00:47:45,681 --> 00:47:47,551
Are you eating the puffed grain snack?

1335
00:47:47,551 --> 00:47:49,181
(The strongest tool, the flipper, appears.)

1336
00:47:49,181 --> 00:47:50,551
Come on, Yeo Eun.

1337
00:47:50,551 --> 00:47:51,881
Come on.

1338
00:47:51,881 --> 00:47:52,981
Hurry up, Yeo Eun.

1339
00:47:53,721 --> 00:47:55,481
You don't have much time.

1340
00:47:55,551 --> 00:47:56,621
Hurry up, Yeo Eun.

1341
00:47:56,621 --> 00:47:58,151
My goodness.

1342
00:47:58,581 --> 00:48:00,481
Why did you do that?

1343
00:48:00,481 --> 00:48:02,051
(The gladiator with a scratcher appears.)

1344
00:48:02,851 --> 00:48:05,121
The flipper is ridiculous.

1345
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:07,251
In 2, 1.

1346
00:48:08,781 --> 00:48:10,451
Jin Young.

1347
00:48:10,681 --> 00:48:12,251
- For goodness' sake. - We are rich.

1348
00:48:12,481 --> 00:48:14,351
(I am sorry. It was too tasty.)

1349
00:48:15,321 --> 00:48:17,021
It's the next group's turn.

1350
00:48:17,881 --> 00:48:18,881
Who are in this race?

1351
00:48:18,881 --> 00:48:20,681
All right.

1352
00:48:20,721 --> 00:48:21,721
Keep that in mind.

1353
00:48:21,721 --> 00:48:23,181
(2 people and 2 tricksters are planning head.)

1354
00:48:25,681 --> 00:48:27,251
(Suspicious)

1355
00:48:28,151 --> 00:48:29,481
I predict that...

1356
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,951
it will be a dirty match.

1357
00:48:31,981 --> 00:48:33,681
Kwang Soo.

1358
00:48:33,681 --> 00:48:35,881
- Let's go. - We can lose this race.

1359
00:48:35,881 --> 00:48:37,451
Let's go.

1360
00:48:37,451 --> 00:48:38,781
(Poor Tae Hwan.)

1361
00:48:38,781 --> 00:48:39,781
Get ready.

1362
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:43,821
(Everyone knew they would do this.)

1363
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:45,351
(The dirty game begins as expected.)

1364
00:48:45,351 --> 00:48:47,351
For goodness' sake.

1365
00:48:47,351 --> 00:48:49,121
This is ridiculous.

1366
00:48:50,251 --> 00:48:52,551
One of them will betray the other.

1367
00:48:52,881 --> 00:48:54,181
One of them will betray the other.

1368
00:48:56,551 --> 00:49:00,481
(The icon of betrayal doesn't disappoint.)

1369
00:49:01,681 --> 00:49:02,781
(Good job, Kwang Soo.)

1370
00:49:02,781 --> 00:49:03,821
Let's go.

1371
00:49:04,821 --> 00:49:06,781
(I will go first.)

1372
00:49:06,781 --> 00:49:08,581
Catch him.

1373
00:49:08,581 --> 00:49:09,681
All right.

1374
00:49:09,681 --> 00:49:11,051
My goodness.

1375
00:49:11,051 --> 00:49:13,721
(Run with a flipper.)

1376
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:15,251
(Sun Bin, am I not the best?)

1377
00:49:16,881 --> 00:49:17,881
Come on.

1378
00:49:17,881 --> 00:49:18,881
(Flailing)

1379
00:49:19,151 --> 00:49:20,781
(What am I supposed to do with a turner?)

1380
00:49:22,051 --> 00:49:24,551
(Why is he running with a box?)

1381
00:49:26,221 --> 00:49:27,581
Here is a flipper.

1382
00:49:27,581 --> 00:49:28,821
Bring it.

1383
00:49:29,321 --> 00:49:30,881
Bring it.

1384
00:49:31,621 --> 00:49:32,621
Come on.

1385
00:49:32,621 --> 00:49:33,721
(I will make it work.)

1386
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:34,721
All right.

1387
00:49:35,081 --> 00:49:36,551
It's okay.

1388
00:49:36,551 --> 00:49:39,181
(Are we doomed?)

1389
00:49:39,181 --> 00:49:40,181
(Panting)

1390
00:49:41,421 --> 00:49:43,581
(So Min, we don't have much time.)

1391
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,451
(Haha, I can receive it well.)

1392
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:50,681
(I am a magnet.)

1393
00:49:52,681 --> 00:49:56,251
(We can do it)

1394
00:49:56,251 --> 00:49:59,421
(We don't have much time. Here comes a long pass.)

1395
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:02,881
Are you okay? I am sorry.

1396
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:07,651
(It turns out she wasn't a magnet.)

1397
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:14,651
(Meanwhile, Sun Bin and Ji Hyo are getting ahead.)

1398
00:50:14,881 --> 00:50:16,151
That's ridiculous.

1399
00:50:16,251 --> 00:50:17,621
That's wrong.

1400
00:50:17,621 --> 00:50:18,981
That's wrong.

1401
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:20,581
- That's wrong. - That's wrong.

1402
00:50:20,581 --> 00:50:22,151
You can't use puffed grain snack like that.

1403
00:50:22,151 --> 00:50:23,481
Let us go one more time.

1404
00:50:23,581 --> 00:50:25,121
Come on.

1405
00:50:28,451 --> 00:50:29,451
Good job.

1406
00:50:29,451 --> 00:50:32,381
(Sun Bin plays foul without holding back.)

1407
00:50:32,781 --> 00:50:34,251
- For goodness' sake. - Good job.

1408
00:50:34,481 --> 00:50:35,721
(Disheartened)

1409
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:37,251
(This is ridiculous.)

1410
00:50:37,421 --> 00:50:39,351
- So Min lost. - For goodness' sake.

1411
00:50:39,681 --> 00:50:41,781
Come on, So Min.

1412
00:50:41,821 --> 00:50:43,521
You need to keep going.

1413
00:50:44,251 --> 00:50:46,881
So Min, put coins on your forehead.

1414
00:50:46,881 --> 00:50:48,151
(Remember who you are.)

1415
00:50:49,981 --> 00:50:52,051
You are the magnet.

1416
00:50:52,051 --> 00:50:53,721
(The magnet doesn't disappoint.)

1417
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:55,251
Come on.

1418
00:50:55,481 --> 00:50:57,551
You can't use puffed grain snack like that.

1419
00:50:58,451 --> 00:51:00,721
In 6, 5, 4,

1420
00:51:00,721 --> 00:51:03,181
- You are almost done. - 3, 2,

1421
00:51:03,581 --> 00:51:04,781
one.

1422
00:51:05,421 --> 00:51:06,421
Time's up.

1423
00:51:07,581 --> 00:51:09,381
So Min, time's up.

1424
00:51:10,681 --> 00:51:12,951
We will weigh the coins.

1425
00:51:12,951 --> 00:51:15,581
(Ji Hyo and Tae Hwan has the most. Jae Seok and Yeo Eun has the least.)

1426
00:51:15,881 --> 00:51:17,081
This is the start.

1427
00:51:17,081 --> 00:51:18,081
This is the start.

1428
00:51:18,081 --> 00:51:20,151
- This is war. - This is war.

1429
00:51:20,151 --> 00:51:21,981
There are cars...

1430
00:51:21,981 --> 00:51:25,221
that will take you to the number one restaurant in Gyeongju...

1431
00:51:25,221 --> 00:51:26,881
- in the parking lot. - I guess we're really going.

1432
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:29,021
There are two restaurants on the list.

1433
00:51:29,021 --> 00:51:31,181
We'll proceed even if you miss this announcement.

1434
00:51:31,181 --> 00:51:32,751
- Goodness. - There are two restaurants...

1435
00:51:32,751 --> 00:51:34,181
and each restaurant has different price and menu.

1436
00:51:34,181 --> 00:51:35,321
Four teams for Korean table d'hote place...

1437
00:51:35,321 --> 00:51:36,451
and three teams for samgyetang place by order of arrival.

1438
00:51:36,451 --> 00:51:38,521
(They take a limited number of teams by order of arrival.)

1439
00:51:39,851 --> 00:51:41,751
(What? Where are you all going?)

1440
00:51:41,751 --> 00:51:44,251
Hey, where are they going? Let's follow them.

1441
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:45,881
What's going on?

1442
00:51:45,951 --> 00:51:48,181
What did he say? I didn't hear him.

1443
00:51:49,121 --> 00:51:51,321
(They have to arrive quickly to choose a cheaper restaurant.)

1444
00:51:51,321 --> 00:51:52,321
Run!

1445
00:51:52,451 --> 00:51:53,781
I haven't even worn my shoes properly.

1446
00:51:53,781 --> 00:51:54,881
(They have to arrive quickly to choose a cheaper restaurant.)

1447
00:51:55,451 --> 00:51:56,851
(They find something ahead of them.)

1448
00:51:56,851 --> 00:51:58,521
- Korean table d'hote. - I haven't even worn my shoes.

1449
00:51:58,521 --> 00:51:59,581
Yeo Eun!

1450
00:52:00,721 --> 00:52:04,481
(Samgyetang is 20 dollars and Korean table d'hote is 15 dollars.)

1451
00:52:04,481 --> 00:52:05,781
It's samgyetang and what?

1452
00:52:05,851 --> 00:52:07,021
- Korean table d'hote! - Korean table d'hote.

1453
00:52:07,021 --> 00:52:08,451
(The couples want to choose the cheaper Korean table d'hote place.)

1454
00:52:09,021 --> 00:52:10,921
(Hey, where should we go?)

1455
00:52:11,781 --> 00:52:15,051
(We have a lot of money, so let's choose samgyetang.)

1456
00:52:15,051 --> 00:52:18,351
We take four teams for Korean table d'hote place by order of arrival.

1457
00:52:19,051 --> 00:52:20,081
Four teams?

1458
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,581
The seats for the Korean table d'hote place is full now.

1459
00:52:21,581 --> 00:52:22,681
(Only Team Ji Hyo chose the samgyetang place.)

1460
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:25,851
If you're not among the four teams who arrived the earliest,

1461
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,121
please get off the bus.

1462
00:52:27,581 --> 00:52:29,021
(Do you mean us?)

1463
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:30,781
- We have no money. - Well...

1464
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:33,021
- We're short on money. - Make a loan then.

1465
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,881
- He gets to borrow money. - Get an I Go Sticker in exchange.

1466
00:52:35,881 --> 00:52:37,221
We don't have enough money.

1467
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:39,181
Samgyetang is good for your health.

1468
00:52:39,181 --> 00:52:41,451
- I want to eat Korean table d'hote. - No, let's just eat samgyetang.

1469
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:42,451
We don't have enough money.

1470
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:44,021
Samgyetang is good for your health.

1471
00:52:44,581 --> 00:52:46,621
- Welcome. - We're in trouble.

1472
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:48,051
- Welcome. - Hey.

1473
00:52:48,051 --> 00:52:49,051
(They get on the bus for samgyetang.)

1474
00:52:49,051 --> 00:52:50,251
- Welcome. - We have enough money.

1475
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:52,121
- You chose samgyetang? - Yes.

1476
00:52:52,121 --> 00:52:53,381
- Let's enjoy expensive food. - Gosh.

1477
00:52:53,551 --> 00:52:55,981
Korean table d'hote is way better than samgyetang.

1478
00:52:55,981 --> 00:52:57,881
Really? But I wanted to have samgyetang.

1479
00:52:57,881 --> 00:52:59,251
We wanted to have samgyetang.

1480
00:52:59,451 --> 00:53:02,851
Congratulations for getting aboard this bus.

1481
00:53:02,851 --> 00:53:06,681
I'm not sure if you saw what happened earlier,

1482
00:53:06,681 --> 00:53:10,051
but Se Chan cared for his partner...

1483
00:53:10,051 --> 00:53:12,721
and told her to put her ring off during the game.

1484
00:53:12,721 --> 00:53:15,751
Na Eun thanked him and took her ring and bracelet off.

1485
00:53:15,751 --> 00:53:16,951
Then she handed them to Se Chan.

1486
00:53:16,951 --> 00:53:20,351
(Thank you. Can you hold my ring for a second?)

1487
00:53:20,351 --> 00:53:21,421
Really.

1488
00:53:22,381 --> 00:53:24,051
- Like this. - Gosh.

1489
00:53:24,051 --> 00:53:27,751
(She naturally handed her ring to her butler, Se Chan.)

1490
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:29,821
Don't you have to take this bracelet off too?

1491
00:53:29,821 --> 00:53:31,181
Take them all off.

1492
00:53:32,051 --> 00:53:33,121
Just in case.

1493
00:53:33,181 --> 00:53:35,251
- That was so natural. - That wasn't for show.

1494
00:53:35,251 --> 00:53:37,221
- I put them in my pocket. - He was too focused on his act.

1495
00:53:37,221 --> 00:53:40,021
She was worried I'd steal them and reminded me...

1496
00:53:40,021 --> 00:53:41,651
to give her ring back.

1497
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:43,221
(Don't forget to return it.)

1498
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:45,681
- I was like, "Okay." - You probably acted suspicious.

1499
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:46,821
So I gave them back to her.

1500
00:53:46,821 --> 00:53:48,351
- That was funny. - I'm envious of her.

1501
00:53:48,351 --> 00:53:49,481
- What's there to envy? - Just because.

1502
00:53:49,481 --> 00:53:51,181
We're most envious of the magnetic human.

1503
00:53:51,181 --> 00:53:52,851
- Right. - I'm envious.

1504
00:53:52,851 --> 00:53:54,821
You're born with an incredible ability.

1505
00:53:54,821 --> 00:53:56,451
- It's unbelievable, right? - She's a heroine.

1506
00:53:56,451 --> 00:53:58,821
I just think you're really like a frog.

1507
00:53:58,821 --> 00:54:01,321
(She's rather a frog than a heroine.)

1508
00:54:01,581 --> 00:54:03,951
Then Yeo Eun is like a frog too since the two of us look alike.

1509
00:54:03,951 --> 00:54:06,081
You two look a bit like fish.

1510
00:54:07,081 --> 00:54:08,151
(What do you mean, fish?)

1511
00:54:08,151 --> 00:54:09,251
- Let's stop here. - Gosh.

1512
00:54:09,781 --> 00:54:10,851
- Goldfish. - It's great.

1513
00:54:10,851 --> 00:54:12,251
Right, you look a bit like goldfish.

1514
00:54:12,251 --> 00:54:13,981
- You do. - Yes, you look like carp.

1515
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:15,651
Carp with big eyes.

1516
00:54:15,651 --> 00:54:16,951
- Right. - She really looks like one.

1517
00:54:16,951 --> 00:54:19,521
Na Eun looks like a kind of wild animals.

1518
00:54:19,521 --> 00:54:21,051
- Wild animals? - Wild animals?

1519
00:54:21,051 --> 00:54:22,981
- Squirrel. - That's right.

1520
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:24,921
- She looks like squirrel. - Something small.

1521
00:54:24,921 --> 00:54:27,481
(Na Eun's butler is falling in love again.)

1522
00:54:28,121 --> 00:54:31,321
(She isn't a squirrel.)

1523
00:54:31,321 --> 00:54:33,351
She looks like a sika deer.

1524
00:54:33,351 --> 00:54:34,821
- Maybe a rabbit. - A sika deer?

1525
00:54:35,351 --> 00:54:37,551
(She's shy to hear his butler.)

1526
00:54:37,551 --> 00:54:39,881
- Gosh, Se Chan. - Stop it.

1527
00:54:39,881 --> 00:54:42,151
- Don't be like this. - You went too far.

1528
00:54:42,151 --> 00:54:43,881
- Not at all. - You did go too far.

1529
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:45,681
- Gosh. - Seriously.

1530
00:54:45,681 --> 00:54:47,621
(My sika deer is the most beautiful in the world.)

1531
00:54:47,621 --> 00:54:49,321
I look like a dried pollack and you look like a hairy crab.

1532
00:54:49,321 --> 00:54:51,851
- Se Chan is a typical... - Kwang Soo's like a giant anchovy.

1533
00:54:51,851 --> 00:54:53,621
(By taking another look)

1534
00:54:53,621 --> 00:54:55,021
- He's like a giant anchovy. - What?

1535
00:54:55,021 --> 00:54:56,421
(What on earth is a giant anchovy?)

1536
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:57,981
- Goodness. - For making broth.

1537
00:54:57,981 --> 00:54:59,551
- Giant anchovy. - What was that?

1538
00:54:59,551 --> 00:55:01,751
- I know what you mean. - The ones with giant poop, right?

1539
00:55:01,751 --> 00:55:03,021
Exactly.

1540
00:55:03,021 --> 00:55:04,481
You have to take it all out. Otherwise, it tastes bitter.

1541
00:55:04,481 --> 00:55:07,021
He also looks like cutlass fish, but let's go with a giant anchovy.

1542
00:55:07,021 --> 00:55:09,181
- That explains him perfectly. - What is a giant anchovy?

1543
00:55:10,551 --> 00:55:12,821
I'm not sure what it is, but Yeo Eun looks like a kind of fish.

1544
00:55:12,881 --> 00:55:14,751
- Hello. - Hello.

1545
00:55:14,751 --> 00:55:16,721
(They arrive at the Korean table d'hote restaurant.)

1546
00:55:17,351 --> 00:55:18,721
It's really Korean table d'hote.

1547
00:55:18,721 --> 00:55:20,181
It looks delicious!

1548
00:55:20,451 --> 00:55:22,321
- That soybean paste stew! - Awesome!

1549
00:55:22,321 --> 00:55:24,081
This has to be tasty.

1550
00:55:24,081 --> 00:55:25,581
(They're impressed to see so many delicious dishes.)

1551
00:55:25,581 --> 00:55:27,051
It's warm.

1552
00:55:27,051 --> 00:55:29,181
- Gosh, this is... - What should we do?

1553
00:55:29,181 --> 00:55:30,381
(From spicy grilled pollack...)

1554
00:55:30,381 --> 00:55:33,681
(to mackerel and tofu that will recharge their energy)

1555
00:55:34,181 --> 00:55:35,381
What is this?

1556
00:55:35,381 --> 00:55:38,781
(It's jeyuk bokkem, the best side dish.)

1557
00:55:39,251 --> 00:55:40,551
Can we start eating now?

1558
00:55:40,551 --> 00:55:43,151
You can go ahead and enjoy the meal.

1559
00:55:43,151 --> 00:55:44,481
- Really? - Do we get to enjoy freely?

1560
00:55:44,481 --> 00:55:46,351
- Do we just eat? - Thanks for the food.

1561
00:55:46,351 --> 00:55:47,781
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you.

1562
00:55:47,781 --> 00:55:49,421
Yeo Eun, eat up.

1563
00:55:49,421 --> 00:55:50,581
Thank you for the meal.

1564
00:55:51,051 --> 00:55:52,251
Let's focus on eating first.

1565
00:55:52,951 --> 00:55:55,081
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you and enjoy!

1566
00:55:55,621 --> 00:55:57,481
Look at this kimchi. It's no joke.

1567
00:55:57,481 --> 00:55:59,821
It's just incredible.

1568
00:55:59,821 --> 00:56:02,221
My gosh. It's awesome!

1569
00:56:02,221 --> 00:56:03,251
(Chicken boiled with various medicinal herbs)

1570
00:56:03,551 --> 00:56:05,351
(They dig in without having doubts.)

1571
00:56:05,351 --> 00:56:06,481
It's delicious.

1572
00:56:09,181 --> 00:56:10,881
- I won't do that. - What happens if we make a loan?

1573
00:56:10,881 --> 00:56:13,951
I won't borrow money. You'll be okay, but I'll be doomed if I do.

1574
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:17,851
- Are you doing this for the show? - It's not because of the show.

1575
00:56:18,181 --> 00:56:19,181
- Really? - Yes.

1576
00:56:19,721 --> 00:56:21,081
You're nice.

1577
00:56:21,581 --> 00:56:22,881
Suck this in.

1578
00:56:22,881 --> 00:56:24,921
(Suck this in.)

1579
00:56:25,151 --> 00:56:27,051
(Jin Young melts Jong Kook's stiff heart.)

1580
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:29,021
You definitely need to suck them all in.

1581
00:56:29,551 --> 00:56:30,581
- Here. - Okay.

1582
00:56:30,581 --> 00:56:32,881
She's great at things like this.

1583
00:56:34,251 --> 00:56:35,451
(She's great at things like this.)

1584
00:56:35,451 --> 00:56:39,151
(Her cuteness is making Jong Kook go out of his mind.)

1585
00:56:39,581 --> 00:56:40,581
(Open up!)

1586
00:56:40,581 --> 00:56:42,381
(Eating)

1587
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,951
It's good to have someone who takes care of me.

1588
00:56:44,951 --> 00:56:46,551
(He realizes it's great to be cared.)

1589
00:56:47,381 --> 00:56:51,721
(And Kwang Soo is yet too shy to be cared by someone.)

1590
00:56:51,721 --> 00:56:53,081
I didn't put much in it.

1591
00:56:55,221 --> 00:56:56,251
Thank you.

1592
00:56:57,021 --> 00:57:00,021
Here's a wrap to express my gratitude to you.

1593
00:57:00,021 --> 00:57:01,451
(He's thankful and makes her a wrap.)

1594
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:03,021
- Thank you. - Thanks.

1595
00:57:03,581 --> 00:57:04,821
Thanks, Yeo Eun.

1596
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,151
(Have some tofu too.)

1597
00:57:07,351 --> 00:57:10,551
(The other couples care for each other.)

1598
00:57:10,551 --> 00:57:12,551
Na Eun, can you put a piece of kimchi on my spoon?

1599
00:57:13,951 --> 00:57:16,081
(Glancing)

1600
00:57:17,581 --> 00:57:18,751
(What a dork.)

1601
00:57:18,751 --> 00:57:19,851
Thanks.

1602
00:57:20,951 --> 00:57:21,981
Thank you.

1603
00:57:22,581 --> 00:57:25,181
(She's the best.)

1604
00:57:26,251 --> 00:57:27,251
Are you done with your meals?

1605
00:57:27,251 --> 00:57:28,451
- Yes. - Yes.

1606
00:57:28,451 --> 00:57:30,081
All right, everyone.

1607
00:57:30,081 --> 00:57:33,251
It's 15 dollars per table,

1608
00:57:33,251 --> 00:57:35,521
so the total is 60 dollars.

1609
00:57:35,909 --> 00:57:37,821
You have to answer randomly to a question to win the game.

1610
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:41,879
The winning team will not have to pay for the meal.

1611
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:42,587
Okay.

1612
00:57:42,612 --> 00:57:44,442
- Do you want to go first? - No, go ahead.

1613
00:57:44,442 --> 00:57:45,942
- Okay. - So Min will go first.

1614
00:57:46,141 --> 00:57:47,741
- Let's get started. - Ready, go.

1615
00:57:47,741 --> 00:57:49,982
Ready, set, go.

1616
00:57:50,069 --> 00:57:51,139
What comes to your mind when you look at a mirror?

1617
00:57:51,139 --> 00:57:52,439
Magnetic human.

1618
00:57:53,209 --> 00:57:55,139
(It totally makes sense.)

1619
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:56,939
What was that?

1620
00:57:57,309 --> 00:57:59,969
(Gosh, it totally makes sense!)

1621
00:58:00,439 --> 00:58:02,209
Why would you say that?

1622
00:58:02,209 --> 00:58:04,509
It's natural to think about it when you look at a mirror.

1623
00:58:04,509 --> 00:58:06,009
(She keeps reminding herself that she's magnetic.)

1624
00:58:06,009 --> 00:58:08,669
- She knows it herself. - That's the word I was thinking.

1625
00:58:08,669 --> 00:58:10,739
Isn't it so cool? Imagine it's the scene from a movie.

1626
00:58:10,739 --> 00:58:11,869
- She's indeed a heroine. - She looks at the mirror...

1627
00:58:11,869 --> 00:58:13,239
and tells herself that she's magnetic.

1628
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,239
- It's so cool. - I'll save the world today.

1629
00:58:15,309 --> 00:58:17,239
- She's indeed a heroine. - Indeed.

1630
00:58:17,739 --> 00:58:19,639
You live out of a sense of responsibility.

1631
00:58:19,769 --> 00:58:21,869
She failed at her first answer.

1632
00:58:21,869 --> 00:58:24,309
All right, Na Eun. Get ready.

1633
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:25,539
(She tries to distract Na Eun.)

1634
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:27,709
Set, go.

1635
00:58:27,709 --> 00:58:28,809
What's the wallpaper for your cellphone?

1636
00:58:28,809 --> 00:58:29,809
It's red.

1637
00:58:30,739 --> 00:58:33,639
(So the wallpaper for your cellphone is in red.)

1638
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:34,969
- Na Eun! - She's so good.

1639
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,409
Gosh, Ms. Sika Deer!

1640
00:58:36,409 --> 00:58:38,769
Don't you think you like colors too much?

1641
00:58:38,769 --> 00:58:40,369
- Okay. - I couldn't think of anything else.

1642
00:58:40,369 --> 00:58:42,339
- So Min is up again. - She has another chance.

1643
00:58:42,339 --> 00:58:43,769
- Let's go again. - It's all right.

1644
00:58:43,769 --> 00:58:45,609
- Each of you get another chance. - It's like a shootout.

1645
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:47,809
Ready, set, go.

1646
00:58:47,809 --> 00:58:48,809
What was the precognitive dream of your birth?

1647
00:58:48,809 --> 00:58:50,139
Korean table d'hote.

1648
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:56,069
(I see. Your parents dreamed of a hearty Korean table d'hote.)

1649
00:58:56,469 --> 00:58:59,439
(That's such a delicious cognitive dream of your birth.)

1650
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:01,839
- What a d'hote. - Was it Korean table d'hote?

1651
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,539
- Right. - That sounds so hearty.

1652
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:05,969
- Sure. - That's why she became magnetic.

1653
00:59:05,969 --> 00:59:08,039
(She'll turn out to be great.)

1654
00:59:08,539 --> 00:59:11,069
(Behind her mysterious ability...)

1655
00:59:11,069 --> 00:59:14,009
(is the power of Korean table d'hote.)

1656
00:59:14,839 --> 00:59:17,309
(So Min fails.)

1657
00:59:17,439 --> 00:59:19,769
- It's Na Eun's turn now. - You can do it!

1658
00:59:20,509 --> 00:59:22,609
Ready, set, go.

1659
00:59:22,609 --> 00:59:24,609
- What's in your bag? - 9 times 9 is 81.

1660
00:59:24,609 --> 00:59:26,869
- When do you think you're cutest? - Blue.

1661
00:59:26,869 --> 00:59:27,909
What's your favorite girl group?

1662
00:59:29,539 --> 00:59:34,769
(If she succeeds this time, Na Eun and Se Chan will win the 1st round.)

1663
00:59:34,769 --> 00:59:36,569
- What's your favorite girl group? - Yellow.

1664
00:59:37,139 --> 00:59:38,569
- That's a success. - Okay!

1665
00:59:40,469 --> 00:59:42,439
(With 3 consecutive nonsensical answers, she wins.)

1666
00:59:42,439 --> 00:59:43,569
Okay!

1667
00:59:44,209 --> 00:59:45,369
I knew it. She's the best.

1668
00:59:45,369 --> 00:59:47,269
- You will advance to the final. - Final? That's awesome.

1669
00:59:47,539 --> 00:59:48,809
- This is great. - All right.

1670
00:59:49,009 --> 00:59:50,309
So Min fails.

1671
00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:51,469
(Se Chan and Na Eun go to the final.)

1672
00:59:52,069 --> 00:59:53,739
Sun Bin and Yeo Eun, you are up.

1673
00:59:53,739 --> 00:59:55,109
You must answer three questions.

1674
00:59:55,409 --> 00:59:56,609
Yeo Eun, you can do it.

1675
00:59:56,609 --> 00:59:57,669
Get ready.

1676
00:59:57,669 --> 00:59:59,139
(Sun Bin tries first.)

1677
00:59:59,339 --> 01:00:01,209
Start.

1678
01:00:01,209 --> 01:00:02,409
How do you relieve your stress?

1679
01:00:02,409 --> 01:00:03,469
Leggings.

1680
01:00:03,769 --> 01:00:05,609
(Incorrect)

1681
01:00:07,109 --> 01:00:09,469
- How can leggings be helpful? - You can relieve stress with them.

1682
01:00:09,669 --> 01:00:11,409
She said she uses them. We don't know how.

1683
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:12,809
- That's what she said. - Hey.

1684
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:14,769
- Her answer didn't make sense. - We don't know how.

1685
01:00:15,469 --> 01:00:17,209
- It was Sun Bin who said that. - Come on.

1686
01:00:17,209 --> 01:00:19,039
How can someone relieve stress with leggings?

1687
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:21,639
- Kwang Soo, they are tight. - That's what she meant.

1688
01:00:21,939 --> 01:00:23,209
That's how she relieves stress?

1689
01:00:23,209 --> 01:00:24,309
- For some, it works. - Of course.

1690
01:00:24,309 --> 01:00:26,709
Since she said she uses them to relieve stress, that's the end.

1691
01:00:26,709 --> 01:00:28,069
- Incorrect. - You can't do anything about that.

1692
01:00:28,539 --> 01:00:29,939
Did my answer really make sense?

1693
01:00:29,939 --> 01:00:31,139
- Yes, it did. - But...

1694
01:00:31,139 --> 01:00:32,269
We'll start again.

1695
01:00:32,269 --> 01:00:34,439
Get ready. Start.

1696
01:00:34,439 --> 01:00:35,509
What is your motto?

1697
01:00:35,769 --> 01:00:36,839
Water park.

1698
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:38,109
Which role do you want to play?

1699
01:00:38,839 --> 01:00:39,839
Meat.

1700
01:00:41,909 --> 01:00:43,669
- Hold on. - You took too long.

1701
01:00:43,669 --> 01:00:44,809
- Wait. - I wasn't going to...

1702
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:46,009
Which role do you want to play?

1703
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:47,939
(Excuse me?)

1704
01:00:47,939 --> 01:00:49,509
(Is playing a piece of meat possible?)

1705
01:00:49,609 --> 01:00:51,569
- Hold on. - I wasn't trying to be mean.

1706
01:00:51,569 --> 01:00:52,639
You took too long.

1707
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:54,139
I played a fish before.

1708
01:00:54,139 --> 01:00:55,439
Playing a piece of meat is possible.

1709
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,769
- It's very possible. - Goodness.

1710
01:00:57,769 --> 01:00:59,469
- She can play that role. - No way.

1711
01:00:59,469 --> 01:01:02,109
- He has a point. He played a fish. - Kwang Soo is right.

1712
01:01:02,109 --> 01:01:03,739
- Sun Bin is next. - We'll start again.

1713
01:01:03,739 --> 01:01:05,339
Start.

1714
01:01:05,339 --> 01:01:06,469
Say a word to the President.

1715
01:01:07,939 --> 01:01:09,009
Hello.

1716
01:01:10,509 --> 01:01:11,639
Hold on.

1717
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:12,839
Say a word to the President.

1718
01:01:12,839 --> 01:01:15,369
(I have to say a word to the President?)

1719
01:01:15,369 --> 01:01:17,239
- Hold on. - Hey, you!

1720
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:20,769
Sun Bin, if you have something to say, you can say it.

1721
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:22,139
You did well. Come on!

1722
01:01:22,869 --> 01:01:24,669
- Sun Bin, you can talk to him. - Seriously.

1723
01:01:24,669 --> 01:01:25,809
Congratulations.

1724
01:01:26,469 --> 01:01:28,109
Please make Korea beautiful.

1725
01:01:28,709 --> 01:01:29,869
What could she have said?

1726
01:01:30,509 --> 01:01:32,439
All right. Yeo Eun, it's your turn now.

1727
01:01:33,139 --> 01:01:34,569
I just got the chills.

1728
01:01:35,809 --> 01:01:37,709
- It's Yeo Eun's turn. - We'll start again.

1729
01:01:37,809 --> 01:01:39,209
That's right. Don't think.

1730
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:42,609
(Her strategy is to be in a daze.)

1731
01:01:42,839 --> 01:01:45,139
- Yeo Eun is trying not to focus. - What should we do?

1732
01:01:45,139 --> 01:01:46,969
- It's funny how she's in a daze. - No.

1733
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:48,469
Yeo Eun, not focusing on it is great.

1734
01:01:48,469 --> 01:01:49,839
- Get ready. - Don't think.

1735
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:51,309
Start.

1736
01:01:51,309 --> 01:01:52,509
What do you want to be in your next life?

1737
01:01:52,509 --> 01:01:53,639
No walking.

1738
01:01:53,639 --> 01:01:55,569
- What did you dream last night? - Stop.

1739
01:01:55,569 --> 01:01:56,969
- What was your baby dream? - Straight.

1740
01:01:57,509 --> 01:01:59,639
Straight? That's an acceptable answer?

1741
01:02:00,139 --> 01:02:01,839
(Yeo Eun manages to answer absurdly 3 times in a row.)

1742
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:03,069
That's an acceptable answer?

1743
01:02:04,509 --> 01:02:07,569
- Her baby dream... Hold on. - She did it.

1744
01:02:07,569 --> 01:02:09,009
You thought her answer didn't make sense.

1745
01:02:09,069 --> 01:02:10,669
Yet, you thought it made sense she relieves stress with leggings?

1746
01:02:10,969 --> 01:02:12,139
- That made sense. - That's right.

1747
01:02:12,469 --> 01:02:14,909
Have you ever dreamed of going backward?

1748
01:02:15,809 --> 01:02:17,839
- I dreamed it last night. - Really?

1749
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:19,139
- Yes, I did. - Are you serious?

1750
01:02:19,139 --> 01:02:20,839
The day before yesterday, I dreamed of making a left turn.

1751
01:02:22,139 --> 01:02:24,609
(Despite Kwang Soo's claims, Yeo Eun advances to the final.)

1752
01:02:24,609 --> 01:02:27,309
The final match is between Na Eun and Yeo Eun.

1753
01:02:27,739 --> 01:02:29,069
I was close though.

1754
01:02:30,939 --> 01:02:32,809
- I'll try it. - Ha Young will try it.

1755
01:02:32,809 --> 01:02:34,109
Jin Young will play too.

1756
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:35,809
Jin Young.

1757
01:02:35,939 --> 01:02:37,139
Face each other.

1758
01:02:37,339 --> 01:02:39,069
- By the way... - Start.

1759
01:02:39,469 --> 01:02:40,669
Do you like soda?

1760
01:02:40,669 --> 01:02:41,839
18.

1761
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:45,209
(Looking cheerful)

1762
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:47,709
- Why? - Hey!

1763
01:02:48,369 --> 01:02:51,069
(What a cheerful answer.)

1764
01:02:51,069 --> 01:02:52,069
- Why? - Hey!

1765
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:53,109
Come on.

1766
01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:54,269
- I said the number. - The number?

1767
01:02:54,569 --> 01:02:55,709
- I said the number. - The number.

1768
01:02:55,709 --> 01:02:57,469
(Don't get the wrong idea.)

1769
01:02:57,469 --> 01:02:59,909
- Can this part air? - Didn't I tell you before?

1770
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:01,369
She was cute when she said it though.

1771
01:03:01,369 --> 01:03:03,569
(Since it's cute and bubbly, it passed the censorship.)

1772
01:03:03,569 --> 01:03:05,139
18. Can I do this?

1773
01:03:05,509 --> 01:03:06,509
By the way,

1774
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:09,139
it's strange that I don't feel insulted when I hear it.

1775
01:03:09,139 --> 01:03:11,069
Exactly. This answer was acceptable.

1776
01:03:11,069 --> 01:03:12,139
You have to admit that.

1777
01:03:12,139 --> 01:03:13,269
- 1 more time? - 1 more time.

1778
01:03:13,269 --> 01:03:14,409
Okay. Let's play it again.

1779
01:03:14,409 --> 01:03:15,669
- One more time? - Let's do it over.

1780
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:16,909
- Start. - Start.

1781
01:03:16,909 --> 01:03:19,009
- What is your level of cholesterol? - I need to poop.

1782
01:03:19,009 --> 01:03:20,209
What is your IQ?

1783
01:03:20,209 --> 01:03:21,209
My stomach hurts.

1784
01:03:21,209 --> 01:03:22,739
Did you put on fake eyelashes?

1785
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:23,769
20.

1786
01:03:23,769 --> 01:03:25,539
- 20? That makes sense. - 20 eyelashes?

1787
01:03:25,569 --> 01:03:27,639
(20 eyelashes)

1788
01:03:28,109 --> 01:03:30,539
(This completely makes sense.)

1789
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:32,509
- 20? That makes sense. - 20 eyelashes?

1790
01:03:32,509 --> 01:03:33,639
- Why? - 20 eyelashes?

1791
01:03:34,409 --> 01:03:36,469
Because you said I can't say 18,

1792
01:03:36,609 --> 01:03:37,909
I can't come up with an answer.

1793
01:03:38,539 --> 01:03:40,769
(Seok Jin and Ha Young win the game by luck.)

1794
01:03:40,769 --> 01:03:42,939
- She's good. - Seok Jin and Ha Young win.

1795
01:03:42,939 --> 01:03:45,609
(Jong Kook and Jin Young spend 60 dollars for the meal.)

1796
01:03:46,409 --> 01:03:48,009
- Na Eun, you should go first. - You can go first.

1797
01:03:48,009 --> 01:03:49,509
- Should I go first? - Okay.

1798
01:03:49,969 --> 01:03:51,109
Get ready, Na Eun.

1799
01:03:51,109 --> 01:03:53,139
(Na Eun and Yeo Eun play the final match.)

1800
01:03:53,139 --> 01:03:54,269
Get ready.

1801
01:03:54,269 --> 01:03:55,409
Set.

1802
01:03:55,409 --> 01:03:56,839
Start.

1803
01:03:56,839 --> 01:03:58,069
What does So Min remind you of?

1804
01:03:58,069 --> 01:03:59,209
3 times 6 is 18.

1805
01:03:59,209 --> 01:04:00,809
(Even you, Na Eun?)

1806
01:04:03,069 --> 01:04:04,969
- 18? - Wait. How old are you?

1807
01:04:05,539 --> 01:04:06,969
- What's wrong? - Is that how you'll play it?

1808
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:08,209
It's just a multiplication.

1809
01:04:08,209 --> 01:04:09,939
You got feisty since you've been working with Psy.

1810
01:04:09,939 --> 01:04:10,969
How can you?

1811
01:04:10,969 --> 01:04:12,069
So Min is older than you.

1812
01:04:12,069 --> 01:04:13,269
It's just a number.

1813
01:04:13,269 --> 01:04:14,509
What did she do wrong?

1814
01:04:14,509 --> 01:04:16,069
It's the multiplication table.

1815
01:04:17,209 --> 01:04:19,139
- I'm sorry. - You are sorry?

1816
01:04:19,139 --> 01:04:20,809
(That was sudden.)

1817
01:04:22,209 --> 01:04:24,669
If you are sorry, it sounds like you meant it.

1818
01:04:24,669 --> 01:04:25,669
(How can you apologize?)

1819
01:04:26,339 --> 01:04:27,909
Na Eun, it sounds like you did curse at her.

1820
01:04:27,909 --> 01:04:30,139
(You didn't mean that, right?)

1821
01:04:30,569 --> 01:04:31,609
Yeo Eun.

1822
01:04:32,269 --> 01:04:33,269
We'll start again.

1823
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:34,269
(Na Eun gets a second chance.)

1824
01:04:34,269 --> 01:04:35,269
Get ready.

1825
01:04:35,269 --> 01:04:36,639
Start.

1826
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,239
- Say a word to your parents. - Red.

1827
01:04:38,539 --> 01:04:39,839
What do you want to be in your next life?

1828
01:04:39,869 --> 01:04:41,339
Everybody, put your hands up.

1829
01:04:41,339 --> 01:04:42,469
What's in your refrigerator?

1830
01:04:44,709 --> 01:04:48,269
(If she says another absurd answer, they won't pay for the meal.)

1831
01:04:48,269 --> 01:04:50,139
- What's in your refrigerator? - Delicious.

1832
01:04:50,269 --> 01:04:52,009
- Picked cucumber? - Cucumber?

1833
01:04:52,009 --> 01:04:53,909
- Did she say, "pickled cucumber"? - She said, "delicious".

1834
01:04:53,909 --> 01:04:55,739
- She said, "delicious". - Did she say, "pickled cucumber"?

1835
01:04:55,739 --> 01:04:56,969
- Delicious. - She said it's delicious.

1836
01:04:56,969 --> 01:04:59,469
- Are you sure? - She said, "delicious".

1837
01:04:59,469 --> 01:05:01,469
- Delicious. - Pickled cucumber.

1838
01:05:01,469 --> 01:05:02,539
Okay.

1839
01:05:02,539 --> 01:05:04,039
(Na Eun succeeds.)

1840
01:05:05,269 --> 01:05:06,609
Na Eun wins!

1841
01:05:06,609 --> 01:05:08,109
(Se Chan and Na Eun won't pay for the meal.)

1842
01:05:08,109 --> 01:05:09,139
We did it!

1843
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:10,739
(You are the best, Na Eun.)

1844
01:05:10,739 --> 01:05:11,869
They won't pay for the meal?

1845
01:05:11,869 --> 01:05:14,339
Either 3 teams will pay together and divide 60 dollars among you.

1846
01:05:14,339 --> 01:05:15,739
Or one team can pay it all.

1847
01:05:15,739 --> 01:05:17,009
One team should pay it all.

1848
01:05:17,139 --> 01:05:18,439
- It's 60 dollars? - Yes.

1849
01:05:18,569 --> 01:05:20,809
- Let's play a game of luck. - Let one team pay for it.

1850
01:05:21,239 --> 01:05:22,809
- Sure. That's neat. - Okay.

1851
01:05:22,809 --> 01:05:24,209
- I'm in. - Let's do it.

1852
01:05:24,209 --> 01:05:26,569
(The game of luck to choose a team to pay the whole bill begins.)

1853
01:05:26,569 --> 01:05:28,939
The person who draws the spoon without the sticker loses, right?

1854
01:05:28,939 --> 01:05:30,539
The one without the sticker loses.

1855
01:05:30,539 --> 01:05:31,839
- Okay. - The number has to be on it.

1856
01:05:32,269 --> 01:05:33,669
It's 60 dollars.

1857
01:05:33,769 --> 01:05:34,969
Who will draw first?

1858
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:36,269
Kwang Soo will draw first.

1859
01:05:36,269 --> 01:05:38,369
- No, Sun Bin will draw for me. - She will?

1860
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:41,139
- No, you can't do that. - I'm not good at this too.

1861
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:42,969
(What are you talking about?)

1862
01:05:42,969 --> 01:05:44,139
- Kwang Soo should draw. - Kwang Soo should draw.

1863
01:05:44,469 --> 01:05:45,639
- This time... - Why?

1864
01:05:45,639 --> 01:05:47,009
- Men should pick this time. - I agree.

1865
01:05:47,309 --> 01:05:49,269
Kwang Soo, you might be lucky this time.

1866
01:05:49,269 --> 01:05:50,769
- He has to pick the one without it. - Those jerks.

1867
01:05:50,939 --> 01:05:52,309
I wish the game ends here.

1868
01:05:53,009 --> 01:05:54,509
- I wish the game ends here. - Show the spoon right away.

1869
01:05:54,609 --> 01:05:58,369
(Mark my words. I will be reborn as the Best Hands.)

1870
01:05:58,369 --> 01:06:02,339
(My lady, Sun Bin, is watching me.)

1871
01:06:02,339 --> 01:06:03,809
(I can't pick the wrong spoon.)

1872
01:06:03,809 --> 01:06:05,109
- In 1, 2, 3. - Kwang Soo.

1873
01:06:05,909 --> 01:06:10,409
(He picks the spoon without the sticker.)

1874
01:06:10,409 --> 01:06:12,339
No way. How can you have predicted this?

1875
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:13,769
It really happened.

1876
01:06:13,939 --> 01:06:15,609
Isn't this amazing?

1877
01:06:16,009 --> 01:06:18,069
(I have faith in you, Kwang Soo.)

1878
01:06:18,069 --> 01:06:20,739
(I guess I shouldn't have.)

1879
01:06:21,139 --> 01:06:22,739
(He is unlucky regardless of where he is.)

1880
01:06:22,739 --> 01:06:23,969
I feel like this is like a set up.

1881
01:06:23,969 --> 01:06:25,269
No, you did pick the wrong one.

1882
01:06:25,769 --> 01:06:26,769
Goodness.

1883
01:06:26,769 --> 01:06:28,069
How can this be possible?

1884
01:06:29,109 --> 01:06:30,409
How can this happen?

1885
01:06:30,709 --> 01:06:32,009
This really is amazing.

1886
01:06:32,139 --> 01:06:33,309
I'm sorry.

1887
01:06:33,309 --> 01:06:34,839
Kwang Soo, I'm sorry for you.

1888
01:06:35,139 --> 01:06:36,809
He is scary.

1889
01:06:37,009 --> 01:06:39,339
Sun Bin, when you see him like this, what do you think about him?

1890
01:06:39,339 --> 01:06:41,839
- Is he cute? - He's cute.

1891
01:06:42,139 --> 01:06:43,139
She said he's cute.

1892
01:06:43,309 --> 01:06:44,809
Cute Kwang Soo, give us 60 dollars.

1893
01:06:44,809 --> 01:06:47,009
(Cute Kwang Soo, give us 60 dollars.)

1894
01:06:47,609 --> 01:06:49,869
Thank you for the food.

1895
01:06:50,409 --> 01:06:51,509
(They spend 60 dollars in an instant.)

1896
01:06:51,509 --> 01:06:52,839
- Goodness. - Let's play it again.

1897
01:06:52,839 --> 01:06:53,839
(This is fun.)

1898
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:54,909
Let's go for the second round.

1899
01:06:55,939 --> 01:06:57,009
Let's have coffee.

1900
01:06:57,309 --> 01:06:59,809
- Shall we play one more for drinks? - Yes.

1901
01:07:00,469 --> 01:07:02,139
- 1, 2, 3, 4... - It's for everyone.

1902
01:07:02,409 --> 01:07:04,839
- Eight. - Let's play the roulette this time.

1903
01:07:05,209 --> 01:07:07,709
- It will cost 40 dollars. - That's great.

1904
01:07:08,139 --> 01:07:09,909
- This is for coffee. - For coffee.

1905
01:07:10,139 --> 01:07:11,369
For your information,

1906
01:07:11,369 --> 01:07:14,369
Se Chan only has 37 dollars. If his name is drawn...

1907
01:07:14,369 --> 01:07:15,369
He has to get a loan, right?

1908
01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:17,609
He will get an I Go Sticker.

1909
01:07:17,609 --> 01:07:19,409
His team doesn't have enough money.

1910
01:07:19,439 --> 01:07:21,069
We can't be chosen. If we are, I am in trouble.

1911
01:07:21,069 --> 01:07:22,709
I will have to get the sticker.

1912
01:07:22,909 --> 01:07:24,139
We'll play it fair.

1913
01:07:24,139 --> 01:07:25,709
- Please. - Give it a strong spin.

1914
01:07:25,739 --> 01:07:26,809
Get ready.

1915
01:07:27,439 --> 01:07:28,639
- Start. - Please don't be me.

1916
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:34,409
(Will Kwang Soo who just spent 60 dollars, be chosen?)

1917
01:07:34,409 --> 01:07:36,909
(Or will it be Se Chan who might have to get a loan?)

1918
01:07:37,309 --> 01:07:39,009
Please don't be me.

1919
01:07:39,009 --> 01:07:40,469
(Or will it be other members?)

1920
01:07:40,869 --> 01:07:43,509
(They all have an equal chance. Who will buy the 2nd round?)

1921
01:07:43,509 --> 01:07:44,609
Please.

1922
01:07:44,609 --> 01:07:46,809
(They all have an equal chance. Who will buy the 2nd round?)

1923
01:07:46,809 --> 01:07:48,069
It's Kwang Soo!

1924
01:07:48,069 --> 01:07:52,609
(At this point, this is getting boring.)

1925
01:07:53,009 --> 01:07:54,969
(He's forced to treat the meal and the coffee.)

1926
01:07:54,969 --> 01:07:56,669
How can this actually happen?

1927
01:07:56,969 --> 01:07:58,639
How can this be possible?

1928
01:07:59,369 --> 01:08:01,009
- How? - I'm sorry.

1929
01:08:01,009 --> 01:08:02,139
You really are so unlucky.

1930
01:08:06,139 --> 01:08:08,839
(He is putting on a show to praise Kwang Soo.)

1931
01:08:09,339 --> 01:08:10,669
He's the unluckiest.

1932
01:08:10,739 --> 01:08:13,069
- This game... - Kwang Soo, you really are.

1933
01:08:13,109 --> 01:08:15,569
Now that I see it with my own eyes, I can't believe how unlucky he is.

1934
01:08:16,909 --> 01:08:18,909
Sun Bin, there's a reason how he became Kwang Soo of 10 Slots.

1935
01:08:19,009 --> 01:08:21,209
You just spent 100 dollars. You are Kwang Soo of 100 Dollars now.

1936
01:08:21,209 --> 01:08:22,339
That's right.

1937
01:08:22,709 --> 01:08:24,209
Please stay away from here. I'm sorry.

1938
01:08:25,069 --> 01:08:26,809
Your luck is unbelievable.

1939
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:30,109
I think he might have brought something from the Labyrinth.

1940
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,109
- No. - Bring what?

1941
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:33,209
He's always been like this.

1942
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:35,609
How can his name be chosen out of all the names?

1943
01:08:36,609 --> 01:08:40,709
(You are so generous, Kwang Soo. Thank you for the coffee too.)

1944
01:08:41,139 --> 01:08:45,969
(Current status of remaining amount of money)

1945
01:08:46,409 --> 01:08:47,509
The final mission is...

1946
01:08:47,509 --> 01:08:49,809
the last chance for those of you to turn the tables around.

1947
01:08:49,969 --> 01:08:52,309
- We can turn the tables around. - We just have to do well now.

1948
01:08:52,309 --> 01:08:53,439
Let's do this.

1949
01:08:53,809 --> 01:08:56,439
It's Search and Stop.

1950
01:08:56,439 --> 01:08:58,409
(The last round of mission is Search and Stop.)

1951
01:08:58,409 --> 01:09:00,279
(Search and stop?)

1952
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:02,309
Within the time limit which is 30 minutes,

1953
01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:06,609
obtain the money in the pouches scattered around the water park.

1954
01:09:07,369 --> 01:09:11,609
If even one member of your team gets his or her name tag removed,

1955
01:09:11,609 --> 01:09:13,709
the team will have to stop for one minute during the mission.

1956
01:09:14,309 --> 01:09:17,009
- The team cannot move an inch. - We can't move.

1957
01:09:17,009 --> 01:09:18,469
We haven't played the name tag race for a while.

1958
01:09:18,669 --> 01:09:21,009
The female members can only remove the name tags.

1959
01:09:21,109 --> 01:09:24,569
The male members can only play defense.

1960
01:09:24,909 --> 01:09:26,069
Jong Kook, protect me.

1961
01:09:26,779 --> 01:09:30,309
If you are ready, please move to your own starting points.

1962
01:09:30,309 --> 01:09:33,839
(Teamwork is the key to this race. What is the ending of the race?)

1963
01:09:34,739 --> 01:09:37,009
- That's right. - Since we have the lowest amount...

1964
01:09:37,779 --> 01:09:39,809
I think we should know how the pouches look.

1965
01:09:39,809 --> 01:09:42,139
- That's the pouch. - It's that yellow object?

1966
01:09:42,139 --> 01:09:43,469
We can take that.

1967
01:09:43,669 --> 01:09:44,709
We will once we start.

1968
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:48,069
It's likely that there's nothing good inside.

1969
01:09:48,069 --> 01:09:49,869
Do you see where the water is rushing out?

1970
01:09:49,969 --> 01:09:51,709
It's likely that that there are pouches there.

1971
01:09:51,969 --> 01:09:53,569
- Where the water is flowing? - Yes.

1972
01:09:53,969 --> 01:09:56,779
They must be in dangerous places.

1973
01:09:56,779 --> 01:09:58,239
What about next to the slide?

1974
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:00,869
- Okay. - We can take one each as we slide.

1975
01:10:00,869 --> 01:10:01,869
(They must take risks for more money.)

1976
01:10:01,869 --> 01:10:03,339
Let's do it.

1977
01:10:03,339 --> 01:10:04,869
It's a war.

1978
01:10:05,369 --> 01:10:07,779
We can climb up there too.

1979
01:10:07,869 --> 01:10:08,939
- That looks fun. - I want to do that.

1980
01:10:09,779 --> 01:10:12,139
I want to converse with you instead.

1981
01:10:12,139 --> 01:10:14,809
(He doesn't care about the mission.)

1982
01:10:15,139 --> 01:10:16,279
I want to have tea with you.

1983
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:18,739
(Mission fees and races are only his excuses.)

1984
01:10:18,739 --> 01:10:19,909
Pose like this.

1985
01:10:19,909 --> 01:10:21,869
Pull out your lips.

1986
01:10:21,869 --> 01:10:23,779
Pull them out.

1987
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:26,139
In 1, 2, 3.

1988
01:10:26,139 --> 01:10:27,239
(The couple gets lovey-dovey.)

1989
01:10:27,239 --> 01:10:28,239
That's good.

1990
01:10:28,809 --> 01:10:34,239
(7 couples are ready for the mission.)

1991
01:10:34,669 --> 01:10:36,339
- How about that one? - Let's try it.

1992
01:10:36,339 --> 01:10:37,709
We have to find the pouches.

1993
01:10:37,709 --> 01:10:38,709
Get ready.

1994
01:10:39,009 --> 01:10:40,369
There must be one over there.

1995
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:41,669
- Three. - Shall we go there?

1996
01:10:41,669 --> 01:10:42,709
Two.

1997
01:10:42,869 --> 01:10:43,869
One.

1998
01:10:44,369 --> 01:10:45,369
Start.

1999
01:10:45,369 --> 01:10:47,409
(Will they stay safe?)

2000
01:10:48,139 --> 01:10:50,339
(The race starts.)

2001
01:10:50,969 --> 01:10:53,609
Let's start with that. Look, there it is.

2002
01:10:53,609 --> 01:10:55,209
- Where? - It's over there.

2003
01:10:55,539 --> 01:10:56,539
This is it.

2004
01:10:56,539 --> 01:10:57,539
(They find a pouch.)

2005
01:10:58,339 --> 01:10:59,839
(How much is in it?)

2006
01:11:01,339 --> 01:11:03,339
- Don't come. I'll do it. - You're tall.

2007
01:11:03,369 --> 01:11:04,369
- You're tall. - It's so cold.

2008
01:11:04,369 --> 01:11:06,709
- It's so cold. - It's okay. You're tall.

2009
01:11:06,709 --> 01:11:09,139
(He backs away.)

2010
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:10,469
- I can do it. - You can do it.

2011
01:11:10,469 --> 01:11:11,739
- I can do it, - You can.

2012
01:11:11,739 --> 01:11:13,239
- but... - You can do it.

2013
01:11:13,239 --> 01:11:14,779
It's much colder than I thought.

2014
01:11:15,509 --> 01:11:16,539
It's really cold.

2015
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:18,239
(What?)

2016
01:11:19,639 --> 01:11:20,969
Wait, Kwang Soo.

2017
01:11:20,969 --> 01:11:24,469
(While Kwang Soo hesitates, Haha tries to beat him to it.)

2018
01:11:24,469 --> 01:11:25,469
Kwang Soo.

2019
01:11:25,469 --> 01:11:28,539
(He won't let him have it.)

2020
01:11:28,539 --> 01:11:30,539
I got it.

2021
01:11:30,969 --> 01:11:31,969
Darn it.

2022
01:11:31,969 --> 01:11:33,279
(He gets a pouch.)

2023
01:11:33,279 --> 01:11:34,279
It's so cold.

2024
01:11:34,279 --> 01:11:35,279
Kwang Soo.

2025
01:11:35,309 --> 01:11:36,569
(They thought they got it, but...)

2026
01:11:36,569 --> 01:11:38,509
No way.

2027
01:11:38,509 --> 01:11:40,439
(It's So Min this time.)

2028
01:11:40,439 --> 01:11:42,439
No, stop it.

2029
01:11:42,439 --> 01:11:44,209
Stop it.

2030
01:11:44,739 --> 01:11:45,779
Wait.

2031
01:11:46,009 --> 01:11:47,509
Don't do this.

2032
01:11:47,509 --> 01:11:49,039
- Haha. - Let's go.

2033
01:11:49,369 --> 01:11:50,609
- Are you okay? - Is this how you'll play?

2034
01:11:50,609 --> 01:11:51,939
No, we're leaving.

2035
01:11:51,969 --> 01:11:53,009
Where are you going?

2036
01:11:53,069 --> 01:11:55,239
Let's not fight.

2037
01:11:56,569 --> 01:11:57,969
(He runs away.)

2038
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:00,779
Why are you leaving me?

2039
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:02,069
(Here's their chance.)

2040
01:12:02,069 --> 01:12:03,839
- Take off her name tag. - No.

2041
01:12:04,869 --> 01:12:06,239
(Tearing)

2042
01:12:06,639 --> 01:12:07,709
We did it.

2043
01:12:07,709 --> 01:12:09,739
(So Min and Haha pause for 1 minute.)

2044
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:10,739
I got one.

2045
01:12:10,739 --> 01:12:13,779
(What happened?)

2046
01:12:13,779 --> 01:12:14,909
Haha.

2047
01:12:14,909 --> 01:12:17,209
(They tore my name tag.)

2048
01:12:17,639 --> 01:12:19,469
Thank you, Haha.

2049
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:21,439
Thank you.

2050
01:12:21,439 --> 01:12:22,669
We got it.

2051
01:12:22,809 --> 01:12:24,509
Let's go.

2052
01:12:26,779 --> 01:12:28,739
Let's take a look inside.

2053
01:12:28,739 --> 01:12:29,779
How much is it?

2054
01:12:30,069 --> 01:12:31,779
- It's 2 dollars. - 2 dollars?

2055
01:12:32,469 --> 01:12:34,539
We should check out where there's no one.

2056
01:12:34,739 --> 01:12:36,839
- We have the least amount of money. - Right here?

2057
01:12:36,909 --> 01:12:38,669
We need to find a lot.

2058
01:12:38,869 --> 01:12:39,869
We really do.

2059
01:12:39,969 --> 01:12:41,469
Shall we go here?

2060
01:12:41,469 --> 01:12:43,409
What's this?

2061
01:12:44,469 --> 01:12:46,569
(A pouch hangs in the air on the slide.)

2062
01:12:46,569 --> 01:12:48,279
- Why is it over there? - It's over there.

2063
01:12:48,279 --> 01:12:49,279
Jae Seok.

2064
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:52,669
(Suddenly water falls on Jae Seok and Yeo Eun.)

2065
01:12:53,909 --> 01:12:57,339
(Search and Stop will not be easy.)

2066
01:12:57,339 --> 01:12:59,009
(High risk means more money.)

2067
01:12:59,009 --> 01:13:01,009
We have the least amount of money.

2068
01:13:01,869 --> 01:13:02,869
That's why.

2069
01:13:02,869 --> 01:13:06,909
(Despite the water bomb and the slide, )

2070
01:13:06,909 --> 01:13:09,339
(they give it a try.)

2071
01:13:09,339 --> 01:13:10,809
I'll go after you.

2072
01:13:10,809 --> 01:13:12,139
I don't think I can do it.

2073
01:13:12,139 --> 01:13:14,139
You'll slide under the pouch.

2074
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:15,809
We're coming down.

2075
01:13:15,809 --> 01:13:17,009
(Will Jae Seok and Yeo Eun obtain the pouch?)

2076
01:13:17,009 --> 01:13:18,539
- Okay. - Here it goes.

2077
01:13:20,869 --> 01:13:22,009
Here it goes.

2078
01:13:23,009 --> 01:13:26,779
(The tube slides down.)

2079
01:13:28,609 --> 01:13:30,969
(Sliding)

2080
01:13:32,609 --> 01:13:34,739
(They fail their first attempt.)

2081
01:13:34,739 --> 01:13:37,009
(On their way back, )

2082
01:13:37,009 --> 01:13:41,239
(they grab the pouch.)

2083
01:13:42,969 --> 01:13:43,969
(They get the pouch.)

2084
01:13:43,969 --> 01:13:44,969
We got it.

2085
01:13:44,969 --> 01:13:46,709
(They get the pouch.)

2086
01:13:47,139 --> 01:13:51,709
(How much is in the pouch that was risky to get?)

2087
01:13:51,709 --> 01:13:53,139
I hope it's 100 dollars.

2088
01:13:53,469 --> 01:13:54,469
It's 10 dollars.

2089
01:13:55,339 --> 01:13:56,339
Goodness.

2090
01:13:56,339 --> 01:13:59,139
(Jae Seok and Yeo Eun obtain 10 dollars.)

2091
01:13:59,139 --> 01:14:00,409
You're doing well.

2092
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:02,239
Go, Ha Young.

2093
01:14:03,809 --> 01:14:05,709
Are we going to slide down?

2094
01:14:05,709 --> 01:14:07,539
- Remove your mics. - We have to?

2095
01:14:07,539 --> 01:14:08,539
Yes.

2096
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,369
- I'll go on this one. - Slide down?

2097
01:14:11,369 --> 01:14:12,709
There's another one.

2098
01:14:13,969 --> 01:14:17,139
Do you want to take this slide instead?

2099
01:14:17,139 --> 01:14:18,909
(Seok Jin is scared of darkness.)

2100
01:14:20,569 --> 01:14:22,279
(Thank you, Ha Young.)

2101
01:14:22,279 --> 01:14:23,869
Is the water deep or not?

2102
01:14:24,139 --> 01:14:25,669
- Shall we go? - Let's go.

2103
01:14:26,069 --> 01:14:27,609
- Go. - Ha Young.

2104
01:14:27,609 --> 01:14:28,779
(Ha Young slides down first.)

2105
01:14:28,779 --> 01:14:29,809
Ha Young.

2106
01:14:29,809 --> 01:14:31,109
(Flying)

2107
01:14:31,139 --> 01:14:33,069
(She grabs the pouch.)

2108
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:34,139
Is the water deep?

2109
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:40,639
(It's time for worrisome Seok Jin.)

2110
01:14:40,639 --> 01:14:44,709
(If Seok Jin succeeds, they obtain two pouches.)

2111
01:14:44,709 --> 01:14:46,869
(Here comes an old man.)

2112
01:14:47,239 --> 01:14:50,139
(He misses.)

2113
01:14:52,009 --> 01:14:54,709
Wait a minute.

2114
01:14:54,709 --> 01:14:58,469
(He fails to grab the pouch.)

2115
01:14:59,069 --> 01:15:00,239
Seok Jin.

2116
01:15:00,469 --> 01:15:01,969
Why didn't you grab it?

2117
01:15:03,869 --> 01:15:05,569
(Guess what?)

2118
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:10,339
(Jae Seok takes the pouch instead.)

2119
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:11,569
He missed it.

2120
01:15:11,969 --> 01:15:13,369
Seok Jin missed it.

2121
01:15:17,139 --> 01:15:18,639
Why didn't you grab it?

2122
01:15:19,069 --> 01:15:20,139
(Jae Seok and Yeo Eun grab it instead.)

2123
01:15:20,139 --> 01:15:21,279
I'll get it.

2124
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:23,369
(Jae Seok and Yeo Eun grab it instead.)

2125
01:15:23,369 --> 01:15:25,779
(He gets sly and takes it.)

2126
01:15:26,469 --> 01:15:28,609
Come on, that's mine.

2127
01:15:28,609 --> 01:15:30,469
You can't do that.

2128
01:15:30,469 --> 01:15:32,109
Why didn't you grab it then?

2129
01:15:33,239 --> 01:15:34,369
It's not that much.

2130
01:15:34,369 --> 01:15:35,669
How much is it? It's a dollar.

2131
01:15:35,669 --> 01:15:37,869
- It's only a dollar. - It's a dollar.

2132
01:15:37,869 --> 01:15:39,139
- My goodness. - Where should we go?

2133
01:15:39,139 --> 01:15:40,369
Let's go over there.

2134
01:15:41,809 --> 01:15:42,939
(There's one on the tree.)

2135
01:15:44,109 --> 01:15:45,839
- Gosh. - How can we climb up?

2136
01:15:46,569 --> 01:15:47,869
We can't climb up.

2137
01:15:47,869 --> 01:15:50,669
(The pouch is too high up.)

2138
01:15:52,009 --> 01:15:54,339
(He tries it anyway.)

2139
01:15:55,669 --> 01:15:58,339
(Struggling)

2140
01:15:59,969 --> 01:16:02,709
(What on earth...)

2141
01:16:02,709 --> 01:16:06,239
(What on earth is he doing?)

2142
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:07,539
I'll do it.

2143
01:16:07,539 --> 01:16:08,609
(Let's work as a team.)

2144
01:16:08,609 --> 01:16:10,609
Do you think I can get on your shoulders?

2145
01:16:10,609 --> 01:16:11,609
Are you okay?

2146
01:16:11,739 --> 01:16:12,869
On my shoulders?

2147
01:16:12,869 --> 01:16:14,139
- Okay. - Are you okay?

2148
01:16:14,369 --> 01:16:15,909
Stand up.

2149
01:16:15,909 --> 01:16:17,139
(Jumping)

2150
01:16:19,369 --> 01:16:20,439
(He takes it.)

2151
01:16:21,509 --> 01:16:24,669
(Jae Seok successfully steals it again.)

2152
01:16:24,669 --> 01:16:27,239
(He takes it from them.)

2153
01:16:27,239 --> 01:16:28,539
Jae Seok.

2154
01:16:29,009 --> 01:16:30,609
- Wait. - Let's see.

2155
01:16:30,609 --> 01:16:31,969
Come on, Jae Seok.

2156
01:16:32,069 --> 01:16:34,069
We were about to get it.

2157
01:16:34,069 --> 01:16:35,139
Goodness.

2158
01:16:35,139 --> 01:16:36,669
You're so good.

2159
01:16:36,669 --> 01:16:38,239
(They can't afford to be polite.)

2160
01:16:38,709 --> 01:16:40,609
I'm too scared.

2161
01:16:40,609 --> 01:16:42,409
Let go of your body on the cable.

2162
01:16:42,669 --> 01:16:43,779
I'm too scared.

2163
01:16:43,779 --> 01:16:44,909
Just close your eyes.

2164
01:16:44,909 --> 01:16:47,139
I'm too scared.

2165
01:16:47,139 --> 01:16:49,069
- Just close your eyes. - I'm scared.

2166
01:16:49,069 --> 01:16:50,339
I'm too scared.

2167
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:52,839
Close your eyes and let go of your body on the cable.

2168
01:16:53,739 --> 01:16:58,639
(It's a zip-line course with 3 stages.)

2169
01:17:00,069 --> 01:17:01,439
Do we just hang on?

2170
01:17:01,439 --> 01:17:02,439
(The first challenge is zip-line.)

2171
01:17:02,439 --> 01:17:04,009
You'll go slowly.

2172
01:17:04,009 --> 01:17:06,069
In 1, 2, 3.

2173
01:17:06,069 --> 01:17:07,569
(Brave Jong Kook starts.)

2174
01:17:07,569 --> 01:17:11,869
(Here comes Jong Kook.)

2175
01:17:11,869 --> 01:17:15,139
This is great.

2176
01:17:15,809 --> 01:17:17,109
Goodness.

2177
01:17:18,439 --> 01:17:19,969
Goodness.

2178
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:21,139
(How can he enjoy it?)

2179
01:17:22,339 --> 01:17:23,509
Goodness.

2180
01:17:24,669 --> 01:17:25,669
This is good.

2181
01:17:25,669 --> 01:17:26,969
(He descends smoothly.)

2182
01:17:27,639 --> 01:17:28,779
It's Jong Kook.

2183
01:17:32,009 --> 01:17:34,569
(He finishes the 1st stage.)

2184
01:17:34,569 --> 01:17:35,609
Here it is.

2185
01:17:36,469 --> 01:17:37,469
Here's the pouch.

2186
01:17:37,469 --> 01:17:38,509
(He obtains the pouch.)

2187
01:17:40,439 --> 01:17:44,239
(However, he must stay alert.)

2188
01:17:44,779 --> 01:17:48,639
(The 2nd stage is crossing a bridge that hangs mid-air.)

2189
01:17:49,069 --> 01:17:51,539
You cross the bridge.

2190
01:17:51,539 --> 01:17:52,969
- Do I cross by foot? - Yes.

2191
01:17:52,969 --> 01:17:53,969
Okay.

2192
01:17:54,279 --> 01:17:57,309
I didn't know it was by foot.

2193
01:18:00,609 --> 01:18:02,039
I didn't know that.

2194
01:18:02,609 --> 01:18:04,069
(The bridge seems unstable.)

2195
01:18:04,069 --> 01:18:06,469
Okay.

2196
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:08,569
Goodness.

2197
01:18:08,569 --> 01:18:10,639
(Even Jong Kook seems scared.)

2198
01:18:10,639 --> 01:18:12,439
Gosh, it's dangerous.

2199
01:18:19,869 --> 01:18:21,279
Jong Kook is crossing.

2200
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:22,779
Is he?

2201
01:18:22,779 --> 01:18:23,779
(I can't do that.)

2202
01:18:25,209 --> 01:18:28,709
(He's fully equipped with safety gear.)

2203
01:18:29,139 --> 01:18:30,239
(Highest level of difficulty)

2204
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:33,639
(A pouch hangs in the middle of the bridge.)

2205
01:18:33,869 --> 01:18:39,779
(For coming this far, he's determined to obtain the pouch.)

2206
01:18:42,009 --> 01:18:43,339
- My goodness. - Please come up.

2207
01:18:43,339 --> 01:18:44,539
(Jin Young waits for zip-lining.)

2208
01:18:44,539 --> 01:18:45,709
I'm so scared.

2209
01:18:45,709 --> 01:18:47,369
(Jin Young waits for zip-lining.)

2210
01:18:47,369 --> 01:18:49,139
My goodness.

2211
01:18:49,139 --> 01:18:50,279
Start as soon as she's ready.

2212
01:18:51,339 --> 01:18:52,779
Wait, what do I do?

2213
01:18:52,909 --> 01:18:54,539
Grab onto the rope.

2214
01:18:55,009 --> 01:18:56,139
Grab it with one hand.

2215
01:18:56,139 --> 01:18:57,139
(She's frightened.)

2216
01:18:57,139 --> 01:18:59,139
My goodness.

2217
01:18:59,779 --> 01:19:00,809
(Crying)

2218
01:19:00,809 --> 01:19:01,869
Did you hear me?

2219
01:19:02,139 --> 01:19:03,709
Where's Jong Kook?

2220
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:05,339
Where is he?

2221
01:19:06,709 --> 01:19:12,339
(He's doing his best to get money.)

2222
01:19:12,339 --> 01:19:13,909
Jin Young can't do this.

2223
01:19:14,509 --> 01:19:15,739
Poor Jin Young.

2224
01:19:16,509 --> 01:19:18,139
I'm worried about her.

2225
01:19:19,069 --> 01:19:20,669
I don't think she can do it.

2226
01:19:24,539 --> 01:19:31,239
(She takes a look at Jong Kook who is far away.)

2227
01:19:31,239 --> 01:19:32,239
Let go.

2228
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:33,369
(I'll be brave too.)

2229
01:19:33,369 --> 01:19:37,869
(If you do it, I'll do it too.)

2230
01:19:39,869 --> 01:19:42,239
(She takes the plunge and rides the zip line.)

2231
01:19:43,639 --> 01:19:48,109
(I'm so proud of my partner.)

2232
01:19:50,039 --> 01:19:52,139
(He arrives at the point where the pouch is.)

2233
01:19:52,939 --> 01:19:53,939
Okay.

2234
01:19:54,539 --> 01:19:56,009
I found a pouch.

2235
01:19:56,009 --> 01:19:58,139
(He finds another pouch.)

2236
01:19:58,309 --> 01:19:59,639
Pouch.

2237
01:20:00,539 --> 01:20:01,779
Let's go up here.

2238
01:20:04,569 --> 01:20:06,509
(They will go up on the biggest tornado slide.)

2239
01:20:06,509 --> 01:20:07,909
Come here.

2240
01:20:09,839 --> 01:20:10,969
- Is it two dollars? - No.

2241
01:20:10,969 --> 01:20:12,139
Is it three dollars?

2242
01:20:12,609 --> 01:20:13,639
It's three dollars.

2243
01:20:15,139 --> 01:20:19,039
(In order to get the money, they must complete the activity!)

2244
01:20:19,339 --> 01:20:21,669
Is it really fast? Its name is tornado.

2245
01:20:22,139 --> 01:20:23,369
- It's really fast? - It's fast?

2246
01:20:23,369 --> 01:20:25,369
- Shall we take off our caps? - Shall we?

2247
01:20:26,939 --> 01:20:29,039
(The slide leaves before they're ready.)

2248
01:20:29,039 --> 01:20:30,839
Hang on. Hang on!

2249
01:20:32,069 --> 01:20:33,239
(Screaming)

2250
01:20:34,469 --> 01:20:36,209
Hold on a second!

2251
01:20:38,969 --> 01:20:40,109
(The tube reaches high.)

2252
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:44,869
(Frightened)

2253
01:20:49,539 --> 01:20:53,109
(The slide ends after whirling greatly.)

2254
01:20:53,309 --> 01:20:56,969
(It was really tough.)

2255
01:20:57,109 --> 01:20:58,109
(At that moment)

2256
01:20:58,109 --> 01:20:59,209
Kwang Soo!

2257
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:04,339
(Team Seok Jin attacks them out of the blue!)

2258
01:21:05,439 --> 01:21:06,969
(Come over here, you guys!)

2259
01:21:06,969 --> 01:21:08,539
(Gosh, that hurts.)

2260
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:10,509
Remove his name tag!

2261
01:21:10,509 --> 01:21:11,569
(This isn't what I planned.)

2262
01:21:11,569 --> 01:21:13,139
Sun Bin, remove her name tag!

2263
01:21:13,139 --> 01:21:14,239
(Who attacked whom?)

2264
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:15,539
- Remove it! - Remove it!

2265
01:21:15,539 --> 01:21:16,739
- Sun Bin, please! - Ha Young!

2266
01:21:16,839 --> 01:21:18,009
Trip her!

2267
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:19,239
Sun Bin, you can do it!

2268
01:21:19,239 --> 01:21:20,779
(It's time out for 1 minute if they rip it.)

2269
01:21:20,779 --> 01:21:22,809
- Kwang Soo. - Sun Bin, remove the name tag!

2270
01:21:23,209 --> 01:21:24,309
Don't lie down.

2271
01:21:24,309 --> 01:21:25,369
(She lies down.)

2272
01:21:26,109 --> 01:21:27,339
- Sun Bin, remove it. - Remove it.

2273
01:21:27,669 --> 01:21:28,779
Sun Bin, eliminate him now.

2274
01:21:28,869 --> 01:21:30,009
(Seok Jin is her target now.)

2275
01:21:30,009 --> 01:21:31,509
Why is she aiming mine?

2276
01:21:32,339 --> 01:21:33,469
(Give me your name tag!)

2277
01:21:33,469 --> 01:21:35,339
- Sun Bin, remove it. - Remove it.

2278
01:21:35,609 --> 01:21:36,939
- Hold on to it. - Remove it.

2279
01:21:36,939 --> 01:21:37,969
(She eliminated Seok Jin.)

2280
01:21:39,039 --> 01:21:42,209
(Seok Jin must stop playing for 1 minute.)

2281
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:46,109
(We attacked them, but we've been counterattacked.)

2282
01:21:46,939 --> 01:21:48,969
Sun Bin is unbelievable.

2283
01:21:48,969 --> 01:21:49,969
She's so absorbed in the game.

2284
01:21:50,279 --> 01:21:51,639
Sun Bin, I see something over there.

2285
01:21:51,809 --> 01:21:53,939
Kwang Soo, there's something over there.

2286
01:21:53,939 --> 01:21:54,939
(Their search for pouches resumes.)

2287
01:21:55,039 --> 01:21:56,309
It must be filled.

2288
01:21:56,309 --> 01:21:57,509
(It's time they found a pouch with a lot of money.)

2289
01:21:57,509 --> 01:21:58,669
Come here. Come here now!

2290
01:21:58,739 --> 01:22:00,009
Kwang Soo!

2291
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:02,739
Kwang Soo.

2292
01:22:02,739 --> 01:22:04,569
(Team Orange is after Sun Bin now.)

2293
01:22:04,569 --> 01:22:05,739
Kwang Soo!

2294
01:22:05,739 --> 01:22:07,509
(Sun Bin, please hang in there!)

2295
01:22:07,509 --> 01:22:09,009
No, no!

2296
01:22:09,369 --> 01:22:11,209
- No! - Remove her name tag.

2297
01:22:11,209 --> 01:22:13,409
(I'll protect my own name tag!)

2298
01:22:13,839 --> 01:22:16,239
(Everyone, get out of my way!)

2299
01:22:17,609 --> 01:22:18,669
(It's a close battle although she's playing alone.)

2300
01:22:18,669 --> 01:22:20,569
- Na Eun, eliminate her. - No way.

2301
01:22:21,909 --> 01:22:22,969
Na Eun, remove the name tag.

2302
01:22:23,009 --> 01:22:24,009
Sun Bin!

2303
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:27,109
- Se Chan, how can you do this? - Help me.

2304
01:22:27,739 --> 01:22:30,069
- Sun Bin! - The service is over.

2305
01:22:30,069 --> 01:22:31,669
- You're pulling my hair. - You're pulling her hair.

2306
01:22:31,669 --> 01:22:32,909
- It's over. - It's not over yet.

2307
01:22:32,909 --> 01:22:34,409
- Take a break for one minute. - It's not over yet.

2308
01:22:35,139 --> 01:22:36,739
Kwang Soo, what on earth are you doing?

2309
01:22:36,739 --> 01:22:38,709
(Kwang Soo, what on earth are you doing?)

2310
01:22:39,139 --> 01:22:40,239
Sun Bin.

2311
01:22:40,539 --> 01:22:42,809
Sun Bin, I'm almost there.

2312
01:22:42,809 --> 01:22:43,809
(I'm almost there!)

2313
01:22:44,139 --> 01:22:45,209
Hold here.

2314
01:22:45,809 --> 01:22:47,279
Kwang Soo!

2315
01:22:48,439 --> 01:22:50,109
- Kwang Soo! - What a tough girl you are.

2316
01:22:50,669 --> 01:22:52,909
(I'm sorry. I'm busy working.)

2317
01:22:53,869 --> 01:22:55,209
Gosh, she's unbelievable.

2318
01:22:55,209 --> 01:22:56,569
(Those who are trying to eliminate her are more exhausted.)

2319
01:22:56,809 --> 01:22:58,239
She's holding her name tag.

2320
01:22:58,239 --> 01:22:59,339
Kwang Soo!

2321
01:23:00,109 --> 01:23:04,069
(Kwang Soo is returning with the pouch.)

2322
01:23:04,069 --> 01:23:05,669
(Screaming)

2323
01:23:05,809 --> 01:23:07,669
She's a moth too.

2324
01:23:07,779 --> 01:23:08,939
Forget it.

2325
01:23:08,939 --> 01:23:10,069
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2326
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:11,109
(Let's give up on this team.)

2327
01:23:11,109 --> 01:23:12,139
Seriously...

2328
01:23:13,339 --> 01:23:15,109
(You're dead once you come home.)

2329
01:23:15,109 --> 01:23:17,139
Hold on. For goodness' sake.

2330
01:23:17,279 --> 01:23:18,709
I was almost eliminated.

2331
01:23:18,709 --> 01:23:20,939
(How much money did Kwang Soo make?)

2332
01:23:20,939 --> 01:23:22,139
Tell me the total amount.

2333
01:23:22,139 --> 01:23:25,669
- It's... - There's only one dollar here.

2334
01:23:26,969 --> 01:23:28,009
Two dollars here.

2335
01:23:28,009 --> 01:23:30,709
(There was two dollars in the other pouch.)

2336
01:23:30,969 --> 01:23:32,139
I even went into the water.

2337
01:23:32,139 --> 01:23:33,779
(Why did we fight so desperately?)

2338
01:23:33,779 --> 01:23:35,239
I wasn't eliminated though.

2339
01:23:35,439 --> 01:23:37,239
- For a second, I thought... - We got three dollars.

2340
01:23:38,669 --> 01:23:40,809
It should've been 40 dollars at least!

2341
01:23:41,309 --> 01:23:43,009
Is my life a joke to you?

2342
01:23:46,139 --> 01:23:48,939
(Meanwhile, the other side of the water park is quiet.)

2343
01:23:48,939 --> 01:23:52,209
(Haha and So Min found a few pouches so far.)

2344
01:23:52,309 --> 01:23:53,569
(Waddling)

2345
01:23:55,609 --> 01:23:57,839
(Why can't I go on the tube?)

2346
01:23:59,609 --> 01:24:01,009
(Hopping)

2347
01:24:01,009 --> 01:24:02,139
(Falling)

2348
01:24:03,509 --> 01:24:06,279
(She probably doesn't get along with rubber since she's a magnet.)

2349
01:24:06,279 --> 01:24:07,639
(Dragging)

2350
01:24:07,639 --> 01:24:08,639
My goodness.

2351
01:24:10,209 --> 01:24:12,969
What are you doing? Why are you carrying it?

2352
01:24:13,369 --> 01:24:14,469
You fool!

2353
01:24:14,469 --> 01:24:15,539
(Come to your senses, you fool!)

2354
01:24:15,539 --> 01:24:16,809
What's wrong with you?

2355
01:24:16,809 --> 01:24:18,239
Did you use up all your strength?

2356
01:24:18,569 --> 01:24:20,009
Give it to me. I'll help you.

2357
01:24:20,009 --> 01:24:21,439
Did you sit? That's not it.

2358
01:24:21,709 --> 01:24:23,339
Don't do that.

2359
01:24:23,339 --> 01:24:25,509
Why do you keep hating yourself?

2360
01:24:25,509 --> 01:24:29,309
(When will they ever find a pouch?)

2361
01:24:31,069 --> 01:24:32,209
What are you doing?

2362
01:24:32,209 --> 01:24:34,069
(Peeping)

2363
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:35,469
Everything's been taken.

2364
01:24:35,469 --> 01:24:36,709
Everything's been taken.

2365
01:24:36,709 --> 01:24:38,809
(What should we do?)

2366
01:24:40,139 --> 01:24:43,539
(Ji Hyo is the only one Tae Hwan cares about.)

2367
01:24:43,869 --> 01:24:46,869
(He follows Ji Hyo all day long.)

2368
01:24:46,869 --> 01:24:48,669
(She does her best.)

2369
01:24:49,709 --> 01:24:50,709
Gosh, I'm tired.

2370
01:24:51,809 --> 01:24:55,039
(Where did Ji Hyo go?)

2371
01:24:56,139 --> 01:24:57,239
Gosh, it's hot.

2372
01:24:57,239 --> 01:24:58,279
(Just like Tae Hwan, )

2373
01:24:58,279 --> 01:25:00,539
(Na Eun is busy fulfilling a mission.)

2374
01:25:00,709 --> 01:25:01,909
Here it goes.

2375
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:06,139
(Screaming out of joy)

2376
01:25:08,439 --> 01:25:11,369
(It looks like a refreshing commercial because of Na Eun.)

2377
01:25:14,739 --> 01:25:16,939
What was that?

2378
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:19,409
(She enjoys all the activities without the two guys.)

2379
01:25:19,409 --> 01:25:20,839
Lift your feet.

2380
01:25:21,509 --> 01:25:23,409
Na Eun!

2381
01:25:24,139 --> 01:25:25,739
I love it.

2382
01:25:28,039 --> 01:25:30,869
(She rides a zip line this time.)

2383
01:25:30,869 --> 01:25:33,809
(She enjoys the leisure activities, and gets money for the mission too.)

2384
01:25:33,809 --> 01:25:37,009
(It's a perfect mission for Na Eun.)

2385
01:25:39,369 --> 01:25:42,039
(I love this water park.)

2386
01:25:42,939 --> 01:25:44,139
Should we do it too?

2387
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:45,139
- This one. - We'll ride this?

2388
01:25:45,809 --> 01:25:47,039
The zip line ride.

2389
01:25:47,039 --> 01:25:49,139
- My goodness. - We should ride the zip line.

2390
01:25:49,139 --> 01:25:50,539
We should also ride the zip line.

2391
01:25:50,539 --> 01:25:53,069
(The teams go to the zip line since it seems challenging.)

2392
01:25:53,109 --> 01:25:55,609
(Ha Young approaches quietly.)

2393
01:25:58,309 --> 01:26:01,409
(She flies like a butterfly, )

2394
01:26:01,409 --> 01:26:04,869
(and stings like a bee!)

2395
01:26:04,869 --> 01:26:08,539
(Removing)

2396
01:26:09,869 --> 01:26:13,839
(Yeo Eun and Ha Young both get 1-minute time out.)

2397
01:26:13,839 --> 01:26:17,509
(The weak are the prey of the strong in this race.)

2398
01:26:18,609 --> 01:26:21,209
Hey, why did you pass them, and eliminate her?

2399
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:22,509
(A brutal counterattack took place in an instant.)

2400
01:26:22,509 --> 01:26:24,439
- Did you scheme it? - Incredible.

2401
01:26:24,609 --> 01:26:26,009
What's the matter with you?

2402
01:26:26,009 --> 01:26:27,309
(I can't believe that they got us again.)

2403
01:26:27,309 --> 01:26:29,139
- You could've eliminated Kwang Soo. - Come on.

2404
01:26:29,139 --> 01:26:31,369
- Let's go. - We'll ride it.

2405
01:26:31,369 --> 01:26:32,369
(Kwang Soo and Sun Bin will ride the zip line.)

2406
01:26:32,369 --> 01:26:33,439
My gosh.

2407
01:26:33,709 --> 01:26:36,409
(Kwang Soo and Sun Bin get to ride due to the other teams' penalty.)

2408
01:26:36,409 --> 01:26:37,409
It's...

2409
01:26:37,969 --> 01:26:39,809
(They get up on the rooftop.)

2410
01:26:39,809 --> 01:26:40,909
My gosh.

2411
01:26:41,809 --> 01:26:42,839
Goodness.

2412
01:26:43,039 --> 01:26:45,569
(Even the spot to get ready for the ride is difficult.)

2413
01:26:45,569 --> 01:26:47,039
- I'm stressed. - Kwang Soo.

2414
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:48,539
It's so stressful.

2415
01:26:48,709 --> 01:26:50,409
Sun Bin, you really like this stuff?

2416
01:26:50,569 --> 01:26:53,139
- In 1, 2... - Hold on. Sun Bin...

2417
01:26:53,139 --> 01:26:54,669
- You got this! - Sun Bin, oh dear.

2418
01:26:54,669 --> 01:26:56,369
- You can do it. - Hold on!

2419
01:26:56,369 --> 01:26:58,509
Don't push me!

2420
01:26:58,509 --> 01:27:02,539
(Screaming)

2421
01:27:06,409 --> 01:27:07,639
It's too fast!

2422
01:27:09,839 --> 01:27:11,139
It's too fast!

2423
01:27:11,239 --> 01:27:12,269
It's too fast.

2424
01:27:12,609 --> 01:27:14,069
I need to get the money quickly.

2425
01:27:14,069 --> 01:27:15,609
It's too fast. Too fast!

2426
01:27:15,869 --> 01:27:16,909
It's too fast.

2427
01:27:16,909 --> 01:27:18,339
(Gosh, it looks fun.)

2428
01:27:18,909 --> 01:27:19,939
It's too fast.

2429
01:27:20,409 --> 01:27:22,139
It's too fast. Be careful. It's too fast!

2430
01:27:23,469 --> 01:27:25,339
It's too fast. Be careful. It's too fast!

2431
01:27:26,109 --> 01:27:27,939
(He lands safely.)

2432
01:27:27,939 --> 01:27:29,539
I'm fine.

2433
01:27:30,509 --> 01:27:31,709
I can't go up.

2434
01:27:31,709 --> 01:27:33,109
(Kwang Soo successfully rides the zip line.)

2435
01:27:33,109 --> 01:27:35,069
Where am I? Oh, my.

2436
01:27:35,069 --> 01:27:37,139
(Next up is the problematic bridge in the air.)

2437
01:27:37,139 --> 01:27:39,139
I can't look down. What should I do?

2438
01:27:39,139 --> 01:27:40,639
- Move back. - Hang on a second.

2439
01:27:41,139 --> 01:27:43,409
What if I fall down?

2440
01:27:44,209 --> 01:27:46,139
There's one more over there.

2441
01:27:46,339 --> 01:27:47,409
There it is!

2442
01:27:47,409 --> 01:27:49,439
(The race is nearing its end.)

2443
01:27:54,139 --> 01:27:57,739
(Everyone does his best to get more money before it ends.)

2444
01:27:57,739 --> 01:28:00,009
- What is this? - A bridge in the air?

2445
01:28:00,669 --> 01:28:01,839
Follow me.

2446
01:28:01,839 --> 01:28:03,039
- I'll go? - Yes.

2447
01:28:03,039 --> 01:28:04,269
My goodness.

2448
01:28:04,509 --> 01:28:05,609
(Kwang Soo can't move a single step on the bridge.)

2449
01:28:05,609 --> 01:28:07,139
- Let's go. - Hold on.

2450
01:28:09,269 --> 01:28:10,339
Don't shake it!

2451
01:28:10,339 --> 01:28:13,809
Don't shake it! Don't shake it!

2452
01:28:15,409 --> 01:28:18,709
I'm not walking on my own will right now.

2453
01:28:18,869 --> 01:28:20,139
Oh, dear.

2454
01:28:20,209 --> 01:28:22,409
Where should I hold? No!

2455
01:28:22,409 --> 01:28:24,369
This makes no sense. Oh, my!

2456
01:28:24,369 --> 01:28:25,469
(The cameraman didn't deserve this.)

2457
01:28:25,469 --> 01:28:26,769
I can't even go back.

2458
01:28:27,309 --> 01:28:28,639
Sun Bin, I'm sorry!

2459
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:30,369
(My partner, I'm sorry!)

2460
01:28:30,369 --> 01:28:31,539
Sun Bin, I'm sorry.

2461
01:28:32,109 --> 01:28:33,539
I'm not cool, am I?

2462
01:28:34,709 --> 01:28:35,809
Sun Bin, I'm sorry.

2463
01:28:36,439 --> 01:28:37,709
Gosh, I can't do it.

2464
01:28:37,709 --> 01:28:38,969
(I apologize for being uncool.)

2465
01:28:38,969 --> 01:28:40,039
Sun Bin.

2466
01:28:40,609 --> 01:28:42,339
I can't look you in the face.

2467
01:28:43,009 --> 01:28:44,039
Sun Bin.

2468
01:28:44,039 --> 01:28:45,069
(I can't face you.)

2469
01:28:45,069 --> 01:28:46,269
I can't look back.

2470
01:28:46,269 --> 01:28:47,609
(The sun sets while he's in the air.)

2471
01:28:47,609 --> 01:28:48,669
Hold on.

2472
01:28:49,109 --> 01:28:50,539
What should I do?

2473
01:28:51,969 --> 01:28:53,439
10 seconds left.

2474
01:28:54,139 --> 01:28:55,139
There's none.

2475
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:57,309
- There's nothing? - Nothing.

2476
01:28:57,409 --> 01:28:58,469
Nothing?

2477
01:28:58,469 --> 01:29:00,439
- Nothing? - The mission has ended.

2478
01:29:00,439 --> 01:29:01,709
- My gosh. - It's over.

2479
01:29:01,709 --> 01:29:05,339
(The last race has ended.)

2480
01:29:05,439 --> 01:29:09,869
(The whistle blows to announce the end.)

2481
01:29:09,869 --> 01:29:10,909
Go home, everyone.

2482
01:29:11,239 --> 01:29:12,639
Sun Bin, you should go home too.

2483
01:29:12,969 --> 01:29:14,069
Leave.

2484
01:29:14,069 --> 01:29:15,409
(I hope you'll all go home.)

2485
01:29:15,509 --> 01:29:16,709
I want you to go home.

2486
01:29:16,709 --> 01:29:18,039
(I want to be alone right now.)

2487
01:29:18,539 --> 01:29:20,809
Helicam, go home. Everyone should go home.

2488
01:29:21,139 --> 01:29:22,509
I'm fine. Go home.

2489
01:29:23,869 --> 01:29:25,269
Save me!

2490
01:29:25,269 --> 01:29:27,009
(I don't care about the mission. Save me!)

2491
01:29:28,409 --> 01:29:30,369
Sun Bin, you suggested to ride this.

2492
01:29:31,009 --> 01:29:32,739
How humiliating is this?

2493
01:29:34,039 --> 01:29:38,669
(I hate this zip line so much.)

2494
01:29:38,669 --> 01:29:43,669
(The game ends with a couple's sad ending.)

2495
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:45,409
The race is over.

2496
01:29:45,409 --> 01:29:48,139
I calculated all the money you have obtained.

2497
01:29:48,139 --> 01:29:49,909
We already know the loser.

2498
01:29:49,969 --> 01:29:52,869
The couple who won the race...

2499
01:29:53,069 --> 01:29:58,509
had the final amount of 246 dollars.

2500
01:29:58,509 --> 01:29:59,539
That's too much.

2501
01:29:59,539 --> 01:30:04,109
(Which couple had 246 dollars?)

2502
01:30:04,109 --> 01:30:05,469
Ji Hyo and Tae Hwan.

2503
01:30:05,469 --> 01:30:07,409
(Ji Hyo and Tae Hwan wins.)

2504
01:30:07,409 --> 01:30:09,069
(It's unbelievable. We won!)

2505
01:30:09,069 --> 01:30:10,269
Gosh, how incredible!

2506
01:30:10,969 --> 01:30:12,309
They left so much money.

2507
01:30:12,539 --> 01:30:14,669
- 240 dollars? - Yes.

2508
01:30:14,739 --> 01:30:16,439
How many pouches did they find?

2509
01:30:17,039 --> 01:30:18,669
Here's the ring, Tae Hwan.

2510
01:30:19,609 --> 01:30:20,939
He's a man, yet he'll take the ring?

2511
01:30:21,639 --> 01:30:22,809
What a shame.

2512
01:30:22,809 --> 01:30:24,109
Gosh, I wanted to give it to her.

2513
01:30:24,809 --> 01:30:27,069
Ji Hyo gets to bet her die...

2514
01:30:27,069 --> 01:30:29,209
once again after last week.

2515
01:30:29,209 --> 01:30:30,369
- Yes! - My goodness.

2516
01:30:30,369 --> 01:30:31,609
Thank you, Tae Hwan.

2517
01:30:31,869 --> 01:30:34,239
The couple who will become the two facial stickers is...

2518
01:30:34,369 --> 01:30:36,209
For your information, this couple...

2519
01:30:36,609 --> 01:30:39,609
lost by two dollars.

2520
01:30:39,609 --> 01:30:40,639
Really?

2521
01:30:40,839 --> 01:30:42,339
How unlucky.

2522
01:30:42,339 --> 01:30:44,239
- I wonder who it is. - Two dollars is so close.

2523
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:46,469
- By any chance... - No way, it's not us.

2524
01:30:48,339 --> 01:30:50,439
Kwang Soo and Sun Bin.

2525
01:30:50,439 --> 01:30:53,669
(Kwang Soo and Sun Bin may be the losing team.)

2526
01:30:54,739 --> 01:30:58,009
- Yes! - Kwang Soo!

2527
01:30:58,009 --> 01:31:01,969
(The unfortunate couple ran out of their money quickly.)

2528
01:31:02,669 --> 01:31:04,409
You have 83 dollars left.

2529
01:31:04,409 --> 01:31:05,839
(Kwang Soo and Sun Bin have 83 dollars left.)

2530
01:31:05,839 --> 01:31:06,939
Is it the team with 81 dollars or 85 dollars?

2531
01:31:06,939 --> 01:31:09,339
Jae Seok and Yeo Eun have...

2532
01:31:09,339 --> 01:31:10,569
(Jae Seok and Yeo Eun may have lost.)

2533
01:31:11,569 --> 01:31:14,369
(They started off with the least amount of money, )

2534
01:31:14,369 --> 01:31:18,009
(but they saved money tenaciously during Search and Stop.)

2535
01:31:19,039 --> 01:31:20,109
They have 80 dollars...

2536
01:31:20,109 --> 01:31:21,939
- Plus 5 or 6 dollars? - Plus 5 dollars.

2537
01:31:21,939 --> 01:31:23,569
- It must be 85 dollars. - 80 dollars plus how much?

2538
01:31:23,569 --> 01:31:24,809
- Please... - No way...

2539
01:31:25,269 --> 01:31:26,309
Plus five dollars.

2540
01:31:26,309 --> 01:31:28,539
(Jae Seok and Yeo Eun have 85 dollars left!)

2541
01:31:28,539 --> 01:31:30,809
(It was a really close game, but Kwang Soo lost by two dollars.)

2542
01:31:30,809 --> 01:31:32,769
- Thank you! - They struggled so much too.

2543
01:31:32,769 --> 01:31:34,409
- Amazing. - Thank you.

2544
01:31:34,539 --> 01:31:35,909
- Let's play once again. - Thank you.

2545
01:31:35,909 --> 01:31:37,869
- Hilarious. - Kwang Soo.

2546
01:31:37,869 --> 01:31:39,309
You were poorer than I thought.

2547
01:31:39,409 --> 01:31:42,069
- What? You worked so hard. - What did you do?

2548
01:31:42,069 --> 01:31:43,139
When I was on the top,

2549
01:31:43,139 --> 01:31:45,969
a rescue party actually came and saved me.

2550
01:31:46,469 --> 01:31:48,869
- I'm serious. - We came down on a lift.

2551
01:31:48,869 --> 01:31:50,269
- Really? - Yes.

2552
01:31:50,269 --> 01:31:51,969
I dived into the deep water...

2553
01:31:53,209 --> 01:31:54,209
and took a bunch,

2554
01:31:54,209 --> 01:31:56,469
but there was only one dollar there.

2555
01:31:56,469 --> 01:31:57,539
(He finds it totally unfair.)

2556
01:31:57,539 --> 01:31:58,769
I went underwater.

2557
01:31:59,469 --> 01:32:01,569
- There was one dollar there. - There was nearly nothing.

2558
01:32:01,969 --> 01:32:03,569
You got us a meal today...

2559
01:32:03,569 --> 01:32:04,739
(Thank you for the meal and the coffee.)

2560
01:32:04,739 --> 01:32:06,309
I started with 200 dollars.

2561
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:09,109
- Thank you. - You began with 100 dollars.

2562
01:32:09,109 --> 01:32:10,909
- Thank you, Kwang Soo. - We went bankrupt.

2563
01:32:10,969 --> 01:32:12,369
- We went bankrupt. - We began with 100 dollars.

2564
01:32:12,369 --> 01:32:13,939
Sun Bin said she wanted to ride the zip line.

2565
01:32:14,109 --> 01:32:15,539
Sun Bin, I'm going to kill you.

2566
01:32:15,539 --> 01:32:17,869
(Love can kill.)

2567
01:32:17,869 --> 01:32:19,009
Gosh!

2568
01:32:19,009 --> 01:32:21,139
I guess your love has waned too.

2569
01:32:21,809 --> 01:32:23,709
- Kwang Soo, thank you. - She looked at me as if...

2570
01:32:23,709 --> 01:32:25,409
I was a bug when I was hanging.

2571
01:32:26,009 --> 01:32:27,109
She was like this.

2572
01:32:27,269 --> 01:32:28,739
I saw.

2573
01:32:29,209 --> 01:32:30,669
How lucky.

2574
01:32:30,809 --> 01:32:33,039
- What a heartwarming finish. - It was full of twist.

2575
01:32:33,039 --> 01:32:34,969
Team Ji Hyo won the race.

2576
01:32:35,069 --> 01:32:37,269
Place the members' faces.

2577
01:32:37,809 --> 01:32:39,039
- Hold your anger. - Seriously...

2578
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:40,769
- I'll get 2 Stickers again? - With 3 Stickers...

2579
01:32:40,769 --> 01:32:42,909
Ji Hyo won last week too. I lost once again...

2580
01:32:43,609 --> 01:32:44,669
after last week.

2581
01:32:44,669 --> 01:32:46,409
Why did you put Se Chan and me together?

2582
01:32:46,409 --> 01:32:47,839
You just need to avoid getting one.

2583
01:32:48,709 --> 01:32:50,309
Here I go.

2584
01:32:50,409 --> 01:32:52,109
Get 6, number 6.

2585
01:32:52,139 --> 01:32:54,139
- It can't be 3. - Please be 6.

2586
01:32:54,139 --> 01:32:56,469
- If we're chosen, it'd be amazing. - Seriously...

2587
01:32:58,309 --> 01:33:03,639
(People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent)

2588
01:33:03,639 --> 01:33:07,569
(You must depart right away after getting 3 Stickers!)

2589
01:33:07,569 --> 01:33:09,469
(Who will be chosen this time?)

2590
01:33:09,469 --> 01:33:10,469
- Please, please. - One, two,

2591
01:33:10,469 --> 01:33:11,469
- three. - Gosh, Se Chan.

2592
01:33:11,469 --> 01:33:14,409
Let it be number six.

2593
01:33:14,409 --> 01:33:15,639
- It can't be number 3. - Let it be 6.

2594
01:33:15,639 --> 01:33:18,209
- Let it be number six. - It's okay.

2595
01:33:18,339 --> 01:33:20,709
- Number 6, number 6. - Please.

2596
01:33:20,769 --> 01:33:21,909
- Number six. - It's okay.

2597
01:33:22,139 --> 01:33:23,569
- It's number five! - It's Haha!

2598
01:33:23,569 --> 01:33:26,369
(Haha is chosen.)

2599
01:33:26,369 --> 01:33:29,339
(It's me?)

2600
01:33:30,809 --> 01:33:35,739
(Kwang Soo is saved, and Haha gets 1 Sticker.)

2601
01:33:35,739 --> 01:33:37,439
- Kwang Soo. - Ji Hyo.

2602
01:33:37,569 --> 01:33:38,809
Kwang Soo wasn't chosen.

2603
01:33:40,069 --> 01:33:42,369
What a twist!

2604
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:44,769
- I can't believe it! - It's over.

2605
01:33:44,769 --> 01:33:46,009
Really?

2606
01:33:46,139 --> 01:33:47,669
- My goodness. - Why...

2607
01:33:48,339 --> 01:33:50,369
- Kwang Soo has 1, and Haha has 2. - Great job, Tae Hwan!

2608
01:33:50,369 --> 01:33:51,609
I wonder...

2609
01:33:51,609 --> 01:33:53,309
why Kwang Soo is happy.

2610
01:33:53,309 --> 01:33:56,039
- Kwang Soo is lucky. - I overcame my two Stickers again.

2611
01:33:56,039 --> 01:33:58,269
- This week... - If I'm chosen, I'm taking you.

2612
01:33:58,269 --> 01:33:59,909
(I'm taking you down with me.)

2613
01:33:59,909 --> 01:34:01,869
- If I'm chosen, I'm taking you. - This week...

2614
01:34:02,339 --> 01:34:03,509
Why are you happy?

2615
01:34:03,509 --> 01:34:05,139
(Haha promises that they'll be together.)

2616
01:34:05,709 --> 01:34:08,339
(Speaking a vulgar language)

2617
01:34:10,339 --> 01:34:12,109
(You're the only one I will choose.)

2618
01:34:12,109 --> 01:34:13,109
Seriously...

2619
01:34:13,469 --> 01:34:14,569
(The race ends in a cheerful vibe.)

2620
01:34:14,569 --> 01:34:15,769
Let's give a round of applause.

2621
01:34:15,769 --> 01:34:17,039
Great job.

2622
01:34:17,139 --> 01:34:21,909
(We thank the best 7 guests who performed superbly in Gyeongju.)

2623
01:34:21,969 --> 01:34:23,809
The two Stickers...

2624
01:34:23,809 --> 01:34:26,309
have been stolen by one of you.

2625
01:34:27,239 --> 01:34:32,939
(They keep suspecting and lying to each other.)

2626
01:34:34,109 --> 01:34:37,639
(They can only deduce with the clues.)

2627
01:34:38,469 --> 01:34:44,509
(A thief versus a sheriff)

2628
01:34:45,139 --> 01:34:48,109
(Hunt down the thief with clues and your sense only!)

2629
01:34:48,109 --> 01:34:50,209
(Who would be the thief?)

2630
01:34:50,209 --> 01:34:51,839
(Who would it be?)

2631
01:34:52,309 --> 01:34:53,439
Hide right here.

2632
01:34:53,609 --> 01:34:55,769
