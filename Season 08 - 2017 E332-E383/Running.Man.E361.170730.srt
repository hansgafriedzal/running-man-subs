1
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:06,065
(Running Man's 7th year anniversary)

2
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,443
I love the seventh year anniversary.

3
00:00:07,783 --> 00:00:10,413
(Congratulations on the 7th year anniversary.)

4
00:00:10,483 --> 00:00:12,313
(They happily started the day of the 7th year anniversary.)

5
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:13,713
(However,)

6
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:17,653
(heavy rain watch is issued on the day of the shoot.)

7
00:00:18,093 --> 00:00:21,463
(Running Man and the family are rushed inside.)

8
00:00:21,823 --> 00:00:23,393
(However)

9
00:00:23,393 --> 00:00:24,563
(She becomes a complete mess.)

10
00:00:25,163 --> 00:00:26,263
(Do you love your friend?)

11
00:00:26,263 --> 00:00:28,003
(I don't exactly love him.)

12
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:31,073
(Heavy rain couldn't stop Running Man and the family.)

13
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,573
(They made people laugh by talking, dancing, and singing.)

14
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,973
(Also)

15
00:00:37,973 --> 00:00:41,483
(Jeon Wook Min is the rising star of arm wrestling.)

16
00:00:41,483 --> 00:00:44,713
(He challenged Jong Kook to an arm wrestling match.)

17
00:00:44,713 --> 00:00:47,483
(Jong Kook used all of his muscles to gain the mission fee.)

18
00:00:48,353 --> 00:00:49,623
(The final match begins now.)

19
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,953
(Kim Jong Kook versus Jeon Wook Min)

20
00:00:53,993 --> 00:00:56,093
(Jong Kook was unrivaled.)

21
00:00:56,093 --> 00:00:58,033
It feels like an international competition.

22
00:00:58,063 --> 00:00:59,093
(He finally meets his match.)

23
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:00,493
My goodness.

24
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:01,503
(He finally meets his match.)

25
00:01:01,963 --> 00:01:03,333
He is very strong.

26
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,703
Look at his arms.

27
00:01:06,703 --> 00:01:09,603
Look at his hips. What will happen?

28
00:01:13,013 --> 00:01:15,743
(By kicking with his left foot in a nonchalant manner,)

29
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:18,113
(he received the best score on the machine.)

30
00:01:18,113 --> 00:01:20,583
(Wook Min is on the top in terms of kicks.)

31
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:23,523
(His current goal is to beat Jong Kook's iron arms.)

32
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,593
- He is very strong. - Look at his arms.

33
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,493
- My goodness. - They are so thick.

34
00:01:28,493 --> 00:01:30,493
- Get ready. - This is unbelievable.

35
00:01:31,463 --> 00:01:32,693
Set, go.

36
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,303
(The final match begins with their pride on the line.)

37
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:36,703
(Who is stronger?)

38
00:01:38,273 --> 00:01:39,303
(Hitting)

39
00:01:41,703 --> 00:01:43,343
- Jong Kook won. - What happened?

40
00:01:43,343 --> 00:01:44,843
(In 2 seconds,)

41
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:47,173
(Wook Min's arm touches the table.)

42
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:48,843
- What happened? - You are in a bad condition, too.

43
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:50,013
What happened?

44
00:01:51,113 --> 00:01:52,653
You are in a bad condition, too.

45
00:01:52,653 --> 00:01:53,683
- I mean... - What happened?

46
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:59,153
- What was that? - Say something.

47
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:00,693
Let's have another match.

48
00:02:01,193 --> 00:02:03,193
- Let's have another match. - Seriously.

49
00:02:03,193 --> 00:02:04,993
- He is too strong. - Really?

50
00:02:04,993 --> 00:02:07,503
- Yes, he is really strong. - Arm wrestle against Hang Ho.

51
00:02:07,803 --> 00:02:09,603
Seriously.

52
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:11,473
- Stay back. - Let's have another match.

53
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:13,473
We can't change the result.

54
00:02:13,703 --> 00:02:15,173
Jong Kook wins.

55
00:02:15,273 --> 00:02:17,713
We won 10 dollars.

56
00:02:17,713 --> 00:02:20,073
We won 10 dollars.

57
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:25,183
My family member's specialty...

58
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,753
is quizzes on general knowledge.

59
00:02:28,123 --> 00:02:31,553
(Kim Jong Myung's specialty: General knowledge)

60
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:34,593
To test Jong Myung's specialty of general knowledge,

61
00:02:34,593 --> 00:02:36,093
we will have Family Golden Bell.

62
00:02:36,093 --> 00:02:37,793
(Family Golden Bell)

63
00:02:37,793 --> 00:02:39,693
You don't need to be worried. Except for Jae Seok,

64
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,063
there is no one you need to worry about.

65
00:02:42,603 --> 00:02:43,603
In human body,

66
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:48,203
what are the three most important nutrients?

67
00:02:48,203 --> 00:02:49,203
What?

68
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:51,543
What are the three most important nutrients?

69
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:52,543
Should we write down all three nutrients?

70
00:02:53,513 --> 00:02:54,543
All three nutrients?

71
00:02:54,683 --> 00:02:55,713
Nutrients?

72
00:02:55,713 --> 00:02:57,753
(Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats)

73
00:02:57,753 --> 00:02:58,753
I wrote down my answer.

74
00:02:59,383 --> 00:03:00,753
Everyone wrote down their answers, right?

75
00:03:00,753 --> 00:03:02,023
- Yes. - I don't know the answer.

76
00:03:02,023 --> 00:03:03,023
Could this be the answer?

77
00:03:03,023 --> 00:03:04,023
One.

78
00:03:04,023 --> 00:03:05,093
(How did the family members do?)

79
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:06,093
Two.

80
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:07,593
Three.

81
00:03:08,163 --> 00:03:11,293
(Jong Kook and Jong Myung's answers are correct.)

82
00:03:11,463 --> 00:03:12,463
Three.

83
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:15,363
(Jae Seok and Sae Ho's answers are correct as well.)

84
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:16,563
Three.

85
00:03:17,803 --> 00:03:20,173
He wrote down vitamins A, C, and D.

86
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:21,803
(He wrote down all vitamins.)

87
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:23,743
(Vitamins are nutrients.)

88
00:03:24,013 --> 00:03:25,013
(They wrote down vitamins as their answer.)

89
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:26,913
Someone wrote down carbohydrates, proteins, and vitamins.

90
00:03:27,213 --> 00:03:28,383
- Carbohydrates? - Yes.

91
00:03:29,913 --> 00:03:33,313
Seok Jin wrote down proteins, water, and salt.

92
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,483
(Water is life.)

93
00:03:34,483 --> 00:03:35,723
It makes sense.

94
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,453
He wrote, "Ji Hyo, I am sorry."

95
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,593
(It's in the style of "The Golden Bell Challenge".)

96
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:41,793
You don't need to be sorry.

97
00:03:41,793 --> 00:03:43,793
(Don't be sorry, Sung Moon.)

98
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:46,193
(Your sister doesn't know the answer either.)

99
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:47,193
The answer is...

100
00:03:48,503 --> 00:03:50,903
carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

101
00:03:50,903 --> 00:03:53,373
(Jae Seok, Sae Ho, Jong Kook, Jong Myung, So Min, and Wook Min)

102
00:03:56,473 --> 00:03:57,943
What about water? Isn't water important?

103
00:03:58,513 --> 00:04:00,713
70 percent of human body is made up of water.

104
00:04:00,713 --> 00:04:02,443
Vitamins wasn't the answer.

105
00:04:02,983 --> 00:04:04,913
It's different from what we have learned.

106
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:06,213
(Isn't it vitamins?)

107
00:04:07,523 --> 00:04:09,753
People learn different things outside of Dongducheon.

108
00:04:12,393 --> 00:04:14,263
- Here comes the second question. - Okay.

109
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:18,793
What does G in G20...

110
00:04:18,893 --> 00:04:20,803
stand for?

111
00:04:21,363 --> 00:04:22,763
This one is hard.

112
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,733
G of G20?

113
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,973
One. All right.

114
00:04:28,203 --> 00:04:29,643
1, 2, 3.

115
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:31,013
We don't need to write it down in English, do we?

116
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:34,183
My answer is global.

117
00:04:34,183 --> 00:04:36,943
Global. Global. Global. Global. Global.

118
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:39,183
- Giant. - General.

119
00:04:39,183 --> 00:04:41,683
General. Gee, gee, gee, gee.

120
00:04:41,683 --> 00:04:43,523
There are 20 Gs.

121
00:04:43,523 --> 00:04:45,623
(They are every words that start with the letter G.)

122
00:04:45,623 --> 00:04:49,063
G20. Global. Global. Global. Global. Global.

123
00:04:49,193 --> 00:04:50,193
Go.

124
00:04:52,563 --> 00:04:53,593
Go.

125
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:54,933
So Min wrote "Go".

126
00:04:55,603 --> 00:04:57,703
You think it means the 20 nations will go.

127
00:04:57,703 --> 00:04:59,833
Global. Global. Global.

128
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,673
- Haha wrote "Group". - Group.

129
00:05:02,203 --> 00:05:03,473
Someone got it right.

130
00:05:03,473 --> 00:05:05,343
- Really? - The answer must be global.

131
00:05:05,343 --> 00:05:07,173
(Most people wrote "global" as the answer.)

132
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,083
G in G20 stands for...

133
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,813
- group. - Really?

134
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:12,813
(Group)

135
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,323
(Haha is the only one with the right answer.)

136
00:05:14,323 --> 00:05:15,623
- Really? - This is unbelievable.

137
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:16,883
Who got it right?

138
00:05:17,123 --> 00:05:18,953
It's not Jong Myung.

139
00:05:18,953 --> 00:05:21,023
- I thought it stood for global. - He is shocked.

140
00:05:21,163 --> 00:05:23,263
- I wrote "global", too. - Haha's answer is correct.

141
00:05:23,263 --> 00:05:25,063
Haha's answer is correct.

142
00:05:25,063 --> 00:05:26,633
(What is going on?)

143
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:28,763
- I thought it stood for global. - Me, too.

144
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:30,003
I thought it was "global".

145
00:05:30,703 --> 00:05:32,403
Here's another easy question.

146
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:33,633
What are the names...

147
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:37,613
of the mothers of Chun Hyang and Sim Chung...

148
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:42,043
from the classical novels, "Chunhyangjeon" and "Simchungjeon"?

149
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,083
- Chun Hyang's mother? - "Chunhyangjeon"...

150
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,353
Sim Chung's mother?

151
00:05:45,883 --> 00:05:47,353
- I know the names of their fathers. - Right.

152
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:49,523
You're talking about Mr. Sim's wife, right?

153
00:05:50,553 --> 00:05:51,823
Yes, his wife.

154
00:05:51,823 --> 00:05:52,823
(He's not interested in others' family business.)

155
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,293
One...

156
00:05:54,293 --> 00:05:55,893
(Those who already got one right win if they guess this correctly.)

157
00:05:55,893 --> 00:05:56,993
Two.

158
00:05:56,993 --> 00:05:58,263
(Will there be a winner?)

159
00:05:58,263 --> 00:06:01,933
Three. Please show me your answers.

160
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:05,103
(Chun Hyang's mother is Wol Mae.)

161
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:08,273
(Sim Chung's mother is Ms. Kwak and her stepmother is Bbaeng Deok.)

162
00:06:08,273 --> 00:06:11,113
(These two got their answers wrong.)

163
00:06:11,473 --> 00:06:13,813
He wrote Chun Hyang's mother's name to be...

164
00:06:14,143 --> 00:06:15,243
"Kim Sook Hee"?

165
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,583
And he wrote Sim Chung's mother's name as "Bbaeng Deok".

166
00:06:18,683 --> 00:06:22,523
- "Gong Yang Mi". - Gosh, that's so funny.

167
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:23,623
Who wrote that?

168
00:06:23,623 --> 00:06:24,953
(He guessed her name to be Gong Yang Mi.)

169
00:06:24,953 --> 00:06:26,023
- Maybe it's Yang Mi. - So Min...

170
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,963
And So Min wrote...

171
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:30,933
Chun Hyang's mother's name as "Chun Lee".

172
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,063
(That sounds American.)

173
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:34,433
You're helpless. What's Chun Lee?

174
00:06:34,433 --> 00:06:36,263
(That's the only name she knows that starts with Chun.)

175
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,073
(Chun Hyang's mother may be somewhat violent.)

176
00:06:40,073 --> 00:06:41,243
Chun Hyang's mother...

177
00:06:41,343 --> 00:06:43,373
He didn't write anything.

178
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:46,673
He wrote "Kim Hye Ja" for Chun Hyang's mother.

179
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:50,653
(He gets the answer wrong again by writing an actress' name.)

180
00:06:50,913 --> 00:06:52,913
- It's just his guess. - I see.

181
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,523
And who is "Kim Chun Ok"?

182
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:56,753
(Whose name did he write down?)

183
00:06:56,753 --> 00:06:57,893
Chun Hyang's mother.

184
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,963
I'm sorry, but can you erase "I love you, Geun Sik"?

185
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:01,963
Why?

186
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,033
- It bothers me. - You're supposed to do this.

187
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:05,093
Goodness.

188
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:07,633
(He's embarrassed by his friend.)

189
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:09,263
So it's "Wol Mae".

190
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,833
I thought the name "Bbaeng Deok" comes out in another story.

191
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,133
Jong Myung got it wrong again.

192
00:07:13,803 --> 00:07:14,973
I don't know these kinds of stuff.

193
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:16,773
He got only one question right so far.

194
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:18,013
Why can't you get the questions right?

195
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:19,113
We got it right.

196
00:07:19,543 --> 00:07:20,643
How could you place first...

197
00:07:20,783 --> 00:07:23,143
- Goodness. - when the guests are here?

198
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,483
- I know, but I can't help it. - That's not polite.

199
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,353
We're doomed.

200
00:07:28,853 --> 00:07:30,383
I got Jong Myung's.

201
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:35,393
(As a result, Team Jae Seok places 1st with 30 dollars.)

202
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:38,193
It's Summer Race with Running Man members' friends and family.

203
00:07:38,193 --> 00:07:40,493
The race is called Dangerous Family Crisis.

204
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,803
(Summer Race, Dangerous Family Crisis)

205
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,173
You will make a team of two with your guest,

206
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,543
and the team with the largest sum of money at the end will win the race.

207
00:07:48,203 --> 00:07:51,713
The winning team will be given the prize and exempted from the penalty.

208
00:07:51,713 --> 00:07:53,613
The losing team with the least amount of money...

209
00:07:53,613 --> 00:07:56,543
and the team chosen by the losing team will take ice shower.

210
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:57,813
Today's penalty is ice shower.

211
00:07:58,483 --> 00:07:59,883
Ice shower.

212
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,323
- The team who gets picked too? - Yes.

213
00:08:03,153 --> 00:08:07,093
After each mission, the top two teams will be given...

214
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:09,593
the chance to switch their partners.

215
00:08:09,593 --> 00:08:11,993
(The top 2 teams will be given a chance to change partners.)

216
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:13,793
My partner?

217
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,003
(Shall I aim to get a new family member?)

218
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:16,833
Your partners can be changed frequently.

219
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:17,973
You seem to love the idea.

220
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:20,033
When it happens, you'll move to another team...

221
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,073
with the money you have in possession.

222
00:08:22,173 --> 00:08:24,873
So you'll have to divide the money well.

223
00:08:25,013 --> 00:08:28,713
(The race is about the teamwork and trust within each team.)

224
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:30,983
You'll get changed into uniforms now.

225
00:08:31,613 --> 00:08:34,383
Then we will start our race for today.

226
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:35,683
- Let's go. - Let's go!

227
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:37,153
(They start their race 7 hours after the shooting.)

228
00:08:37,153 --> 00:08:38,393
Everything we did so far was just an opening.

229
00:08:40,123 --> 00:08:41,323
That was just a warm-up game?

230
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:42,963
I'm hungry.

231
00:08:42,963 --> 00:08:44,033
(They're exhausted already.)

232
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:45,763
(So Min and Wook Min are the first to finish preparing.)

233
00:08:45,763 --> 00:08:47,403
1, 2, 3.

234
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:50,503
(Let's take pictures and send them to our dad.)

235
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:53,173
Send the pictures we just took to Dad.

236
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:54,543
(Dad will love this.)

237
00:08:54,873 --> 00:08:56,673
- Is it done? - Done.

238
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:01,413
Send.

239
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:05,953
It's working. It's being sent now.

240
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,183
It's done.

241
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,223
Mom will love this.

242
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:12,393
(Satisfied)

243
00:09:12,393 --> 00:09:13,423
All right, everyone.

244
00:09:13,423 --> 00:09:15,663
We'll start the mission now.

245
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:18,433
The first mission of Dangerous Family Crisis is...

246
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,933
called Money or Loyalty.

247
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:22,933
(Dangerous Family Crisis, Money or Loyalty)

248
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:24,003
Okay.

249
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,343
2 teams will be playing a game together in 1 group in this mission.

250
00:09:27,643 --> 00:09:29,273
Simply speaking, 4 people will be in 1 group.

251
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:30,943
- Okay. - Good.

252
00:09:30,943 --> 00:09:33,113
- Really? - We should choose carefully.

253
00:09:33,743 --> 00:09:36,643
For example, if all 4 members in each team write 5 dollars...

254
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:39,553
on the papers given to each member,

255
00:09:39,553 --> 00:09:41,623
all of them will be provided five dollars.

256
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,783
(If they write the same amount, they'll be given the money.)

257
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,193
However...

258
00:09:47,423 --> 00:09:50,763
If there's a member who wrote something lower than five dollars,

259
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:54,103
that person will be given 10 times the amount.

260
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:58,873
That person will be given 10 times the amount.

261
00:10:00,173 --> 00:10:03,743
The other three will be given the low amount that person wrote.

262
00:10:05,243 --> 00:10:08,483
- Why do you keep testing us? - It's confusing.

263
00:10:08,543 --> 00:10:11,353
I remember this game. Last time, So Min and Kwang Soo...

264
00:10:11,353 --> 00:10:13,713
- wrote 50 cents. - I remember too.

265
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:20,393
(Last Spring, Haha wrote 3 dollars and 90 cents.)

266
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:25,363
(But So Min wrote 50 cents.)

267
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:29,463
(Kwang Soo wrote 50 cents as well.)

268
00:10:30,303 --> 00:10:32,073
(Let's stop now.)

269
00:10:32,073 --> 00:10:34,503
(So Min, you know how I feel, right?)

270
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:37,813
(It's the game of betrayal that revealed their true nature.)

271
00:10:37,813 --> 00:10:40,273
Don't be hopeful. I know we won't be writing the same.

272
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,443
This is war. We'll do anything to win.

273
00:10:43,783 --> 00:10:45,953
We'll now divide you into groups.

274
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:48,823
Choose a team whom you think is easy to deal with...

275
00:10:48,823 --> 00:10:51,553
- and make a group with them. - 4 members in 1 group?

276
00:10:51,653 --> 00:10:54,423
4 people will be in 1 group to play the mission.

277
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:55,523
It means 2 teams in 1 group.

278
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,533
Gosh, even our uniform color doesn't look intimidating.

279
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,293
(Gosh, even our uniform color doesn't look intimidating.)

280
00:11:01,003 --> 00:11:03,363
(It's yellowish.)

281
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,533
It's a good color.

282
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:06,433
Why...

283
00:11:07,303 --> 00:11:09,803
It looks damp and nice.

284
00:11:11,873 --> 00:11:14,083
Does any team want to do it with us?

285
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,143
(By any chance, does anyone want to do it with us?)

286
00:11:16,413 --> 00:11:17,483
Us.

287
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:18,553
Come here then.

288
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,613
(You guys are our prey.)

289
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,423
(Come on, Kwang Soo.)

290
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,223
(Teams Haha and Team Kwang Soo become a group.)

291
00:11:24,223 --> 00:11:25,323
How much do you have?

292
00:11:25,323 --> 00:11:26,523
We have quite a lot.

293
00:11:27,393 --> 00:11:28,863
(Raising hand)

294
00:11:28,863 --> 00:11:30,063
We're looking for a team as well.

295
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,733
(No one's interested.)

296
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,863
We welcome you.

297
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:40,303
She's totally like a moth that will jump into the flames.

298
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:42,673
Guys, come here.

299
00:11:42,673 --> 00:11:44,113
(Please trust me.)

300
00:11:44,113 --> 00:11:45,543
So Min...

301
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:47,073
is too much of a moth.

302
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:48,843
I can't trust her.

303
00:11:48,843 --> 00:11:51,083
(Wook Min, your sister is treated this way here.)

304
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,753
- Shall we do it with them? - Let's do it.

305
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:53,753
Okay.

306
00:11:53,753 --> 00:11:55,123
- Let's do it. - Let's trust each other.

307
00:11:55,123 --> 00:11:57,523
Beauties have to survive in order for Running Man to survive.

308
00:11:57,693 --> 00:11:58,753
Take So Min out.

309
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:02,363
So Min will definitely write something weird.

310
00:12:02,593 --> 00:12:03,823
We have to focus.

311
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,693
(They finish dividing themselves into groups.)

312
00:12:06,163 --> 00:12:07,803
(First group: Jae Seok, Sae Ho, Seok Jin, Soo Yong)

313
00:12:07,803 --> 00:12:10,933
- Let's just write 5 dollars. - Let's take 5 dollars each.

314
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:14,503
It's hard for me to play smart, so I'll just write five dollars.

315
00:12:14,503 --> 00:12:16,403
- Let's write five dollars. - All right.

316
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,373
- Let's not use tricks. - Let's all write...

317
00:12:18,373 --> 00:12:20,613
- 5 dollars. - Let's write 5 dollars.

318
00:12:21,983 --> 00:12:25,383
(And he tries to write it in secret.)

319
00:12:25,383 --> 00:12:28,923
Jae Seok, where are you going? Just write it here.

320
00:12:29,253 --> 00:12:30,583
Write it here.

321
00:12:30,653 --> 00:12:32,693
- I'll write it here. - There's no need to go over there.

322
00:12:32,693 --> 00:12:33,753
Gosh, Seok Jin.

323
00:12:34,493 --> 00:12:37,733
Let's not betray each other and write five dollars.

324
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:39,393
- Let's make it simple. - Let's be loyal.

325
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:42,403
We'll all write five dollars.

326
00:12:42,403 --> 00:12:45,133
We'll do that and take five dollars each fairly.

327
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,543
- We should. How much do you have? - We should.

328
00:12:48,543 --> 00:12:49,773
I have five dollars. You gave it to me.

329
00:12:49,773 --> 00:12:51,113
But... Hold on.

330
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:53,813
What? You have five dollars only?

331
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:56,143
No, it's supposed to be 15 dollars.

332
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:58,813
(What? Kwang Soo gave me 5 dollars.)

333
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:00,513
You need to have 10 dollars each.

334
00:13:00,983 --> 00:13:02,953
- You won the mission earlier too. - Right.

335
00:13:03,123 --> 00:13:04,323
- I have five dollars. - Okay.

336
00:13:04,323 --> 00:13:05,723
That's right. He's right.

337
00:13:05,723 --> 00:13:06,793
Why is that right?

338
00:13:07,023 --> 00:13:08,263
It's right.

339
00:13:09,023 --> 00:13:10,423
See? Don't let him fool you.

340
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,633
It's right. You have five dollars, right?

341
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,203
- 5 dollars. - You need to have 5 more dollars.

342
00:13:14,203 --> 00:13:15,663
Kwang Soo won the mission earlier.

343
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:17,163
- Remind me later. - You have to have 10 dollars each.

344
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,533
- So that I don't forget. - You have to have 10 dollars each.

345
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:19,873
I'm sure he hid it somewhere.

346
00:13:19,873 --> 00:13:21,743
If you behave like this,

347
00:13:21,743 --> 00:13:23,403
we won't be able to trust each other.

348
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,373
Shouldn't you have five more dollars in possession?

349
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:27,313
(It's strange.)

350
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:28,383
- I mean... - I know.

351
00:13:28,383 --> 00:13:29,543
Should we split the money in half?

352
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:32,483
(Is it necessary?)

353
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,253
- See? - Goodness.

354
00:13:34,253 --> 00:13:35,323
- I mean... - In half?

355
00:13:35,323 --> 00:13:38,693
How can you do that to your family?

356
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:42,423
(A just civilian, Haha, revealed Kwang Soo's embezzlement.)

357
00:13:42,893 --> 00:13:44,733
(Slap)

358
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:47,633
(Hang Ho is in rage.)

359
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,963
You told me you didn't have any more money.

360
00:13:48,963 --> 00:13:50,733
- How could you? - I didn't know.

361
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:52,503
- I'll give it to you. - Seriously.

362
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,173
Here.

363
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,343
- Are you sure about trusting him? - I...

364
00:13:58,343 --> 00:14:00,783
- I didn't mean to... - He gave me four dollars.

365
00:14:00,783 --> 00:14:02,143
(He's in shock.)

366
00:14:02,143 --> 00:14:04,083
- I'll give it to you. - I can't believe this.

367
00:14:04,153 --> 00:14:06,183
- Here! - You're sickening me!

368
00:14:06,183 --> 00:14:08,223
So this is how things work. Okay.

369
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,883
You're the one who's at fault.

370
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,523
- Whom are you taking it out on? - I thought we'd go until the end.

371
00:14:11,623 --> 00:14:12,693
That's what I thought as well.

372
00:14:12,823 --> 00:14:14,493
I can't believe this.

373
00:14:14,863 --> 00:14:15,993
You're such a jerk.

374
00:14:16,093 --> 00:14:18,193
- I had it here. - So give me a dollar.

375
00:14:18,393 --> 00:14:20,163
- Why? - I got you five dollars.

376
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:22,933
(Revealing his true intention)

377
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,233
Here.

378
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:27,103
- Thank you. - Are you serious?

379
00:14:27,103 --> 00:14:28,443
What about me?

380
00:14:28,443 --> 00:14:30,243
"What about me?"

381
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:33,873
(I won't give you a dollar.)

382
00:14:34,313 --> 00:14:37,753
(Will Hang Ho finish the mission without getting emotionally hurt?)

383
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:40,753
- It's unpredictable. - Right.

384
00:14:40,753 --> 00:14:41,883
It's a bit...

385
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:43,483
Write your name on the envelope.

386
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,793
(Ji Hyo and Sung Moon start discussing their plan.)

387
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:47,623
(She's nervous.)

388
00:14:49,293 --> 00:14:50,733
You really can't betray me.

389
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:51,963
(She only has Se Chan to trust on.)

390
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:54,233
Will you betray us and turn this into a war?

391
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,233
It can't be helped because it's an individual game.

392
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:57,473
Our partners can be changed.

393
00:14:57,473 --> 00:14:59,733
(Our partners can be changed.)

394
00:14:59,903 --> 00:15:03,203
- Our partners can be changed. - Wait.

395
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,543
You're thinking of switching partners, aren't you?

396
00:15:05,543 --> 00:15:07,043
- I think so. - No way.

397
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:09,643
- How can I dare do that? - He has it in mind.

398
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,983
I need to have enough money in order to protect you.

399
00:15:12,053 --> 00:15:14,823
- Na Eun, don't trust him. - I'm telling you the truth.

400
00:15:14,923 --> 00:15:16,823
He doesn't sound trustworthy at all.

401
00:15:16,823 --> 00:15:18,623
- Na Eun. - I won't ever do that.

402
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:21,163
But I'm worried she might change her partners.

403
00:15:21,593 --> 00:15:22,693
Will you?

404
00:15:22,693 --> 00:15:25,293
No, well...

405
00:15:25,293 --> 00:15:26,493
(Mumbling all of a sudden)

406
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,033
You're not answering properly.

407
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,773
- We got him. - I have to see how it goes first.

408
00:15:30,903 --> 00:15:31,973
I have no choice.

409
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:35,703
(What will Se Chan, Na Eun, Sung Moon, and Ji Hyo decide?)

410
00:15:35,703 --> 00:15:39,413
All right. We will start with Hang Ho, Kwang Soo, Haha, and Geun Sik.

411
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:40,413
Our team is going to go first?

412
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:43,343
- It's going to be a messy one. - I bet it will be messy.

413
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:46,753
- No, we agreed on a number. - You did?

414
00:15:47,353 --> 00:15:50,583
I think it'd be better if we reveal their numbers at the end.

415
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,653
(The producer sighs.)

416
00:15:52,823 --> 00:15:54,393
- You all made different choices. - It was...

417
00:15:54,393 --> 00:15:55,993
It was a battlefield.

418
00:15:55,993 --> 00:15:57,963
- I'm so sad. Who is it? - I can't believe it.

419
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:01,363
- Don't make that face, Kwang Soo. - You...

420
00:16:01,363 --> 00:16:03,803
- Look at Kwang Soo acting. - Did you write the number we set?

421
00:16:03,803 --> 00:16:05,433
How can you betray us even on our seventh year anniversary?

422
00:16:05,873 --> 00:16:08,773
I will check the amount Seok Jin, Soo Yong, Jae Seok,

423
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:10,203
and Sae Ho wrote down.

424
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:13,313
- We decided to write five dollars. - Yes, we did.

425
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:14,413
Soo Yong wrote...

426
00:16:14,413 --> 00:16:18,713
(If everyone wrote 5 dollars, everyone will receive 5 dollars.)

427
00:16:18,713 --> 00:16:22,983
(They didn't want to play mind tricks. Did their plan work?)

428
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:24,553
He wrote five dollars.

429
00:16:24,823 --> 00:16:26,253
- I knew it. - We did it.

430
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,523
- Goodness. - I knew you were an honest friend.

431
00:16:28,523 --> 00:16:32,233
Soo Yong is known to take care of his finances well.

432
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:33,693
He doesn't make mistakes when it's about money.

433
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,163
We made a promise.

434
00:16:35,563 --> 00:16:36,963
Sae Ho wrote...

435
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,733
(The number he wrote down is next.)

436
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:40,003
He wrote 3 dollars 50 cents.

437
00:16:41,303 --> 00:16:43,503
Sae Ho wrote 3 dollars 50 cents.

438
00:16:44,313 --> 00:16:47,383
- You wrote that? - Sae Ho, you are unbelievable.

439
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:50,483
- Even cabbages cost more than that. - Sae Ho, you are unbelievable.

440
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:52,283
- Think about the cost of cabbages. - Didn't I write five dollars?

441
00:16:52,283 --> 00:16:53,783
- You wrote 3 dollars 50 cents. - I did?

442
00:16:53,783 --> 00:16:56,083
- Did you hear what he said? - Stop acting.

443
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,723
- What are you doing? - Stop acting.

444
00:16:57,793 --> 00:16:59,353
- Soo Yong is really mad. - Hey.

445
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:00,863
I don't get mad easily.

446
00:17:00,893 --> 00:17:04,133
It's so scary when it rains, and Soo Yong moves like that.

447
00:17:04,393 --> 00:17:06,993
- His feet didn't move. - He's like Gaonasi.

448
00:17:08,763 --> 00:17:13,203
(You wrote 3 dollars and 50 cents?)

449
00:17:13,703 --> 00:17:15,373
- He looked like Gaonasi. - He does.

Jae Seok wrote...

451
00:17:19,213 --> 00:17:22,313
1 dollar 10 cents.

452
00:17:24,483 --> 00:17:26,053
(He's shocked.)

453
00:17:26,053 --> 00:17:27,283
You told us to write five dollars.

454
00:17:27,283 --> 00:17:29,683
- The amount I wrote was decent. - 1 dollar 10 cents?

455
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:31,053
What are you talking about?

456
00:17:31,053 --> 00:17:32,923
- His amount is less than mine? - We don't know about Seok Jin's.

457
00:17:32,923 --> 00:17:35,193
Seok Jin wrote 60 cents.

458
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:39,433
(He only wrote 60 cents.)

459
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:43,863
Seok Jin will receive 6 dollars, and the rest of you will get 60 cents.

460
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:46,003
What am I supposed to do with them?

461
00:17:46,003 --> 00:17:47,743
- Take 60 cents. - I'm sorry.

462
00:17:47,843 --> 00:17:50,073
- I can't play with these people. - Hey.

463
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:53,173
- How can you write 60 cents? - I can't believe Seok Jin.

464
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,783
I almost wrote 52 cents.

465
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,953
(Seok Jin gets 6 dollars and the rest get 60 cents.)

466
00:17:58,053 --> 00:18:02,353
Se Chan, Na Eun, Ji Hyo, and Sung Moon are next.

467
00:18:02,353 --> 00:18:03,583
(These 4 young adults are next.)

468
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:06,123
- What did they write? - Na Eun wrote...

469
00:18:06,993 --> 00:18:08,063
five dollars.

470
00:18:09,563 --> 00:18:11,893
- She's the first. - She's an angel.

471
00:18:11,893 --> 00:18:13,633
- I haven't seen anyone like her. - She is truly an angel.

472
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:16,133
- Someone like her does exist. - I didn't know such person existed.

473
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:17,703
- She does exist. - How incredible.

474
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:18,733
She's an angel.

475
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:21,903
I hope everyone wrote five dollars, and gets the money together.

476
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:22,943
- I mean it. - And...

477
00:18:23,443 --> 00:18:26,313
- But Se Chan... - If he wrote that, it'll be moving.

478
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,613
- I agree. I do. - He valued her heart more.

479
00:18:29,783 --> 00:18:30,913
Se Chan.

480
00:18:30,913 --> 00:18:33,183
- He must've wrote the same thing. - Of course he did.

481
00:18:33,183 --> 00:18:34,483
That's right.

482
00:18:34,483 --> 00:18:35,583
(It was a one-sided love and loyalty.)

483
00:18:36,553 --> 00:18:39,353
(How can I abandon you?)

484
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:44,233
(It's an opportunity to prove that his heart hasn't changed.)

485
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:45,493
Se Chan wrote...

486
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:46,993

(But he wrote 90 cents?)

488
00:18:54,603 --> 00:18:55,873
(Capitalism shattered his love.)

489
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:56,873
Se Chan.

(This is how things are on Running Man.)

493
00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:06,053
Se Chan will get 9 dollars, and the rest will get 90 cents.

494
00:19:06,053 --> 00:19:07,983
(Se Chan gets 9 dollars, and the rest get 90 cents.)

495
00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:09,153
- Se Chan! - How can you do that to Na Eun?

496
00:19:09,153 --> 00:19:10,693
- How could you do that to her? - You were mean to Na Eun.

497
00:19:10,793 --> 00:19:12,993
- He's a jerk. - You are unbelievable.

498
00:19:12,993 --> 00:19:15,363
- Se Chan. Goodness. - I had no choice, Haha.

499
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:16,363
- But still. - Na Eun.

500
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,093
You have to meet the right guy.

501
00:19:18,093 --> 00:19:20,333
- You need to choose the right guy. - I'm looking at the bigger picture.

502
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:23,733
I shouldn't have trusted men.

503
00:19:24,403 --> 00:19:26,503
(Se Chan teaches Na Eun a lesson about love.)

504
00:19:26,503 --> 00:19:27,873
We will move onto the next group.

505
00:19:28,003 --> 00:19:30,503
Jong Kook, Jong Myung, So Min, and Wook Min are next.

506
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,913
Jong Kook, Jong Myung, So Min, and Wook Min are next.

507
00:19:31,913 --> 00:19:33,213
I trust them.

508
00:19:33,343 --> 00:19:36,413
Wook Min gave me a chicken breast protein shake during the break.

509
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,513

He's a true man.

513
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:49,093
Our family used to be aristocrats. We are of noble birth.

514
00:19:49,593 --> 00:19:51,893
- Jong Myung wrote... - Jong Myung!

515
00:19:51,893 --> 00:19:53,393
- I bet he wrote 5 dollars. - 5 dollars.

516
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,403
- Really? He's so cool. - Our family is noble.

517
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:58,203
(For the first time, 2 members wrote 5 dollars in a row.)

518
00:19:58,203 --> 00:20:01,903
(What is this group's strategy?)

519
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,613
(30 minutes ago, during the strategy meeting for the mission fee)

520
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,683
(Jong Myung's strategy is to have only one person write...)

521
00:20:08,683 --> 00:20:12,113
(4 dollars 90 cents and divide 49 dollars among 4 members.)

522
00:20:12,113 --> 00:20:13,813
(I like your strategy.)

523
00:20:13,983 --> 00:20:15,953
(Who is going to write 4 dollars 90 cents?)

524
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:17,653
(You should write it.)

525
00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:19,223
He wouldn't betray us.

526
00:20:19,223 --> 00:20:21,923
He's the youngest and your younger brother.

527
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:25,263
(He wouldn't try to pull anything funny like So Min does.)

528
00:20:25,263 --> 00:20:29,963
(This is how Jong Kook and Jong Myung submitted 5 dollars.)

529
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,433
However, you have So Min. She jumps into the flame.

530
00:20:32,803 --> 00:20:34,573
She's like a moth who jumps into the flame without hesitation.

531
00:20:34,573 --> 00:20:35,603
(The biggest obstacle, So Min, remains.)

532
00:20:35,603 --> 00:20:37,003
So Min wrote...

533
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:44,053
(If So Min wrote 5 dollars, their strategy will be a big success.)

534
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,683
So Min wrote...

535
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,213
1 dollar 20 cents.

536
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,653
She betrayed them.

537
00:20:48,753 --> 00:20:50,123
- So Min. - 1 dollar 20 cents.

538
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:51,793
(The Kims are furious.)

539
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,223
She wrote 1 dollar 20 cents?

540
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:56,093
- So Min wrote 1 dollar 20 cents? - She's no joke.

541
00:20:56,093 --> 00:20:58,033
- Hey. - She played Jong Kook.

542
00:20:58,233 --> 00:21:00,193
- Jong Kook, she deceived you. - You wrote 1 dollar 20 cents?

543
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,063
- 1 dollar 20 cents. - I knew it.

544
00:21:02,103 --> 00:21:03,703
She never disappoints me.

545
00:21:03,703 --> 00:21:05,503
- Goodness. - She's something else.

546
00:21:05,503 --> 00:21:08,303
- So Min's brother, Wook Min, - Wook Min.

547
00:21:08,303 --> 00:21:10,403
- wrote 49 cents. - Hey, what?

548
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:11,813
I can't believe you.

549
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:15,943
(What did he say?)

550
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:17,583
What a family.

551
00:21:17,883 --> 00:21:19,783
- They make a nice family. - Hey!

552
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:23,583
(The Kims are at a loss for words.)

553
00:21:25,023 --> 00:21:26,553
(Wook Min has fully adjusted to the show.)

554
00:21:27,393 --> 00:21:30,933
Wook Min will get 4 dollars 90 cents and the rest will get 49 cents.

555
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:33,233
Younger siblings are worse than the older ones.

556
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:36,133
We're not the only opponents he has. He has to go against everyone.

557
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:38,233
Jong Myung is quite angry now.

558
00:21:38,503 --> 00:21:41,043
- He is. - How can you write 49 cents?

559
00:21:41,043 --> 00:21:43,503
- He wants no one to get the money. - He got 4 dollars 90 cents.

560
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:45,073
But he went too far though.

561
00:21:45,073 --> 00:21:46,443
(He gets 4 dollars 90 cents, and the rest get 49 cents.)

562
00:21:46,443 --> 00:21:49,413
It's the turn of the last group in question.

563
00:21:49,413 --> 00:21:52,813
(Everyone has been waiting for this last group in question.)

564
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:53,983
- Why are we in question? - This group...

565
00:21:53,983 --> 00:21:55,123
Why did you say that?

566
00:21:55,723 --> 00:21:57,793
- Why is our group in question? - I didn't do it.

567
00:21:57,793 --> 00:21:59,093
- Everyone wrote five dollars. - Hang Ho wrote...

568
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:02,363
(Hang Ho wrote...)

569
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,523
5 dollars.

570
00:22:04,633 --> 00:22:06,563
- We were supposed to play fair. - That's right.

571
00:22:06,563 --> 00:22:08,163
(Isn't it only natural I write five dollars?)

572
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,933
(They are anxious, and hope he doesn't get hurt.)

573
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:13,573
Geun Sik wrote...

574
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:15,743
1 dollar 90 cents.

575
00:22:16,743 --> 00:22:18,643
- How can you write that amount? - I wanted to win the money.

576
00:22:18,973 --> 00:22:21,313
- I'm so disappointed in you. - I'm sorry.

577
00:22:21,313 --> 00:22:23,043
- I'm disappointed. - But we talked about this.

578
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:26,113
- Hang Ho is mad now. - This is how we play this game.

579
00:22:26,113 --> 00:22:27,583
- Hang Ho is upset. - This is how we play this game.

580
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,483
- Look at Kwang Soo acting. - You made a fool of Hang Ho.

581
00:22:30,453 --> 00:22:34,363
(Kwang Soo and Haha remain, and this pair seems quite suspicious.)

582
00:22:34,363 --> 00:22:36,323
- You made a fool of Hang Ho. - Kwang Soo wrote...

583
00:22:36,323 --> 00:22:37,593
- 49 cents. - Hey!

584
00:22:37,593 --> 00:22:39,133
(This was unexpected of him.)

585
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:40,463
(He feels betrayed.)

586
00:22:40,463 --> 00:22:42,663
- How much did Haha write? - Haha's amount is less than his?

587
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:45,503
(Kwang Soo is indeed different from others.)

588
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:47,133
How much is Haha's amount?

589
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:48,543
- Did I write more than Haha? - I didn't betray you.

590
00:22:48,543 --> 00:22:49,673
How much is Haha's amount?

591
00:22:49,843 --> 00:22:51,143
Haha wrote...

592
00:22:51,513 --> 00:22:52,773
- Why? - How much is it?

593
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:53,913
15 cents.

594
00:22:53,913 --> 00:22:56,443
(This is shocking and scary even.)

595
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:57,813
Goodness.

596
00:22:57,813 --> 00:22:58,983
(You jerk!)

597
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:01,653
Goodness. You're unbelievable.

598
00:23:01,653 --> 00:23:03,083
- What about you then? - You wrote 15 cents?

599
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,423
- How can you write that? - How about you?

600
00:23:04,423 --> 00:23:06,153
- You should've written 50 cents. - I'm sorry.

601
00:23:06,253 --> 00:23:08,623
(But Kwang Soo wrote 49 cents.)

602
00:23:08,623 --> 00:23:10,123
- The minimum amount is 50 cents. - 15 cents are too little.

603
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:12,393
- Hang Ho, I'm sorry. - Writing 15 cents was too cruel.

604
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:15,363
- 20 years ago... - We paired up with the wrong team.

605
00:23:15,363 --> 00:23:17,433
It'd have been better receiving 5 dollars after you wrote 5 dollars.

606
00:23:17,503 --> 00:23:20,373
Haha will get 1 dollar 50 cents, and the rest will get 15 cents.

607
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:22,803
- Why did he do that? - You must write more than 50 cents.

608
00:23:23,543 --> 00:23:24,613
15 cents?

609
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:26,913
(Haha gets 1 dollar 50 cents, and the rest get 15 cents.)

610
00:23:27,313 --> 00:23:29,483
(Current status of mission fees)

611
00:23:29,483 --> 00:23:31,283
(Se Chan and Na Eun are in the lead.)

612
00:23:31,383 --> 00:23:34,583
We prepared your favorite dishes since you must be hungry by now.

613
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:35,623
What are they?

614
00:23:35,823 --> 00:23:37,493
Before we move to the restaurants,

615
00:23:38,123 --> 00:23:40,053
I will present you Hit or Miss Bus Mission.

616
00:23:40,053 --> 00:23:42,363
(Their mission for their dinner is Hit or Miss Bus Mission.)

617
00:23:42,363 --> 00:23:43,363
Get ready to run.

618
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,963
Two buses will head to the restaurants.

619
00:23:47,963 --> 00:23:49,663
The menu for one bus is chicken soup.

620
00:23:49,903 --> 00:23:51,633
The other one is mandarin fish stew.

621
00:23:52,673 --> 00:23:53,973
One of the buses is an express bus.

622
00:23:53,973 --> 00:23:56,873
Everyone will head to the restaurant and enjoy the meal right away.

623
00:23:56,943 --> 00:23:59,143
The other bus is a layover bus. Before your arrival,

624
00:23:59,143 --> 00:24:02,113
you must stop by at a place to find your Meal Cards through a mission.

625
00:24:02,113 --> 00:24:03,243
We have to find Meal Cards.

626
00:24:03,243 --> 00:24:06,413
(One bus is a layover bus, and they must find Meal Cards to eat.)

627
00:24:06,953 --> 00:24:10,993
However, there are only two Meal Cards.

628
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:14,893
The teams who find these Meal Cards first will have dinner.

629
00:24:14,893 --> 00:24:16,263
The rest can't eat?

630
00:24:16,263 --> 00:24:18,533
- 2 teams won't be able to eat. - Only 2 teams won't get to eat.

631
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:21,163
We have to choose the right bus.

632
00:24:21,163 --> 00:24:22,403
Then everyone,

633
00:24:22,403 --> 00:24:25,303
please go and get on the bus.

634
00:24:25,303 --> 00:24:26,803
Hey, let's hurry.

635
00:24:26,803 --> 00:24:28,473
Hey! Hurry, Sae Ho.

636
00:24:28,773 --> 00:24:29,773
- Let's go. - Hurry.

637
00:24:30,103 --> 00:24:32,413
- Be careful when you run. - Let's run.

638
00:24:32,413 --> 00:24:33,873
Hey, Sung Moon.

639
00:24:33,943 --> 00:24:35,443
Which one is for chicken soup?

640
00:24:35,643 --> 00:24:36,683
Here it is.

641
00:24:36,813 --> 00:24:38,453
- Sae Ho. - Yes, Jae Seok.

642
00:24:38,453 --> 00:24:39,953
Let the unlucky ones choose first.

643
00:24:39,953 --> 00:24:41,383
Should we let them choose first?

644
00:24:41,753 --> 00:24:43,553
- Choose the one on the left. - Why are we getting on this one?

645
00:24:43,553 --> 00:24:45,853
- Chicken soup. This is right. - I don't think it's this one.

646
00:24:46,023 --> 00:24:48,223
- What is this? Mandarin fish stew. - This is fish stew.

647
00:24:48,263 --> 00:24:49,293
(Which one is the express bus?)

648
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:50,963
- Mandarin fish stew. - Let's go with this.

649
00:24:51,793 --> 00:24:53,593
Actually, I wanted to choose chicken soup.

650
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:56,363
- That's right. - That's a fancy meal.

651
00:24:56,363 --> 00:24:58,773
This will be the express bus, and we'll have the fish stew right away.

652
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:00,743
- Let's eat mandarin fish stew! - Yes!

653
00:25:00,743 --> 00:25:02,973
Let's go, mandarin fish stew! Trying doesn't hurt.

654
00:25:02,973 --> 00:25:04,443
(Will their dreams come true?)

655
00:25:04,443 --> 00:25:07,813
Judging by the people who got on the bus for chicken soup,

656
00:25:08,243 --> 00:25:10,313
a lot of moths are here.

657
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:13,153
(The bus for chicken soup is crowded with moths.)

658
00:25:13,153 --> 00:25:14,353
- That's right. - Aren't I right?

659
00:25:14,653 --> 00:25:17,283
- I chose the wrong bus. - So Min, Kwang Soo,

660
00:25:17,753 --> 00:25:19,693
- and Se Chan. - Why did you exclude yourself?

661
00:25:19,693 --> 00:25:20,963
(You are the biggest moth.)

662
00:25:21,123 --> 00:25:22,323
(What have I done?)

663
00:25:22,323 --> 00:25:23,363
Jae Seok is the scariest.

664
00:25:23,363 --> 00:25:25,963
A lot of scary members are on the bus for chicken soup.

665
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:29,033
Why did you choose chicken soup?

666
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:33,703
I like it. I'm in the middle of the promotion period.

667
00:25:33,703 --> 00:25:35,343
I should avoid food that is too spicy or salty.

668
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:37,243
You should watch your weight.

669
00:25:37,243 --> 00:25:40,913
- What about you, Se Chan? - I wanted to choose fish stew.

670
00:25:41,443 --> 00:25:43,543
But I had to follow Na Eun.

671
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,613
You two seem to have different tastes.

672
00:25:45,613 --> 00:25:46,813
We're just getting to know each other.

673
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:50,183
You look a bit like a fish.

674
00:25:50,183 --> 00:25:52,923
(You look a bit like a fish.)

675
00:25:52,923 --> 00:25:55,023
(Se Chan looks like a fish.)

676
00:25:55,023 --> 00:25:56,523
- What does that mean? - A bit.

677
00:25:56,523 --> 00:25:57,833
Just a bit.

678
00:25:57,833 --> 00:25:59,393
- Just a little. - Do I look like a fish?

679
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:00,393
- You know what I mean, right? - I think I get it.

680
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:01,603
(Nodding)

681
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:02,863
He looks a bit like a fish.

682
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:05,033
- Especially your mouth. - Here?

683
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:06,673
Your mouth looks a bit like that of a fish.

684
00:26:06,673 --> 00:26:08,003
I look like a fish?

685
00:26:08,043 --> 00:26:10,773
By the way, Wook Min...

686
00:26:11,043 --> 00:26:12,713
is the most handsome guy on this bus.

687
00:26:12,713 --> 00:26:15,613
(Wook Min is the most handsome guy on this bus.)

688
00:26:15,613 --> 00:26:17,713
(Of course.)

689
00:26:17,713 --> 00:26:19,153
(Look...)

690
00:26:19,153 --> 00:26:20,823
(how...)

691
00:26:20,823 --> 00:26:23,823
(the others look.)

692
00:26:23,823 --> 00:26:25,493
(Embarrassed)

693
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:27,193
Hang Ho, what do you think?

694
00:26:27,923 --> 00:26:29,223
- The most good-looking one here? - Yes.

695
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:32,263
- Na Eun? - Yes.

696
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,933
- And then? - So Min, don't glare like that.

697
00:26:33,933 --> 00:26:35,333
(So Min, don't glare like that.)

698
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,263
And then So Min. I'm sorry.

699
00:26:37,403 --> 00:26:39,733
- I'm satisfied. - And then?

700
00:26:39,873 --> 00:26:42,143
- This guy. - Wook Min?

701
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:43,143
Who is next?

702
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,113
(It's been predictable so far.)

703
00:26:45,113 --> 00:26:50,753
(The real competition begins now.)

704
00:26:50,753 --> 00:26:51,783
Kwang Soo.

705
00:26:51,783 --> 00:26:53,453
(Kwang Soo ranks 4th.)

706
00:26:53,453 --> 00:26:54,823
- All right. - Jae Seok.

707
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:56,823
- You have prejudice against me. - Okay.

708
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,353
- Who is next? - I'm not...

709
00:26:58,393 --> 00:26:59,593
- You. - Okay.

710
00:26:59,593 --> 00:27:00,823
Am I competing with Sae Ho?

711
00:27:00,823 --> 00:27:01,823
Who is next?

712
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:04,333
It's...

713
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,533
(Being the least good-looking one on this bus is problematic.)

714
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:10,703
(Will it be Se Chan or Sae Ho?)

715
00:27:10,703 --> 00:27:12,573
- Se Chan. - Of course.

716
00:27:12,573 --> 00:27:13,733
You're at the bottom.

717
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:16,643
(Sae Ho is the least good-looking one.)

718
00:27:17,443 --> 00:27:20,413
(Offended)

719
00:27:20,413 --> 00:27:22,943
(It's so fun to offend Sae Ho.)

720
00:27:22,943 --> 00:27:23,943
It's not important.

721
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:26,113
When I see Hang Ho...

722
00:27:26,113 --> 00:27:27,823
- Be quiet. - I'm sorry.

723
00:27:27,923 --> 00:27:30,283
He spoke for the first time.

724
00:27:30,383 --> 00:27:32,553
You're not talking very well today.

725
00:27:33,293 --> 00:27:35,323
You're not talking very well.

726
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:38,433
He usually talks very well, but not today.

727
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:39,963
I specialize in talking,

728
00:27:39,963 --> 00:27:40,963
- but today... - You're not doing it well.

729
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:41,963
Where did you go wrong?

730
00:27:41,963 --> 00:27:44,403
Right from the start.

731
00:27:44,403 --> 00:27:45,833
- From the start? - What happened yesterday?

732
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:48,043
- My stomach hurts. - Are you okay, Hang Ho?

733
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:49,403
- It's so funny. - He's crying.

734
00:27:49,403 --> 00:27:50,473
What's so funny?

735
00:27:50,473 --> 00:27:52,043
You guys are so funny.

736
00:27:52,043 --> 00:27:54,213
We do this all the time.

737
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:55,213
(He finds Jae Seok and Sae Ho so funny.)

738
00:27:55,643 --> 00:27:58,153
We'll give you the chance...

739
00:27:58,153 --> 00:28:00,153
- to win additional five dollars. - Sounds great.

740
00:28:00,723 --> 00:28:03,653
We'll play Jae Seok's Game.

741
00:28:03,653 --> 00:28:04,653
(Jae Seok's Game)

742
00:28:05,123 --> 00:28:06,553
- Jae Seok's Game. - What's that?

743
00:28:06,623 --> 00:28:07,763
I'm not so confident.

744
00:28:07,763 --> 00:28:08,963
It's...

745
00:28:08,963 --> 00:28:10,733
- Na Eun, do you know what it is? - Yes.

746
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:11,733
You know it, right?

747
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:19,203
(You have to give an irrelevant answer 3 times in a row.)

748
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:21,843
- Se Chan. - I'll start.

749
00:28:21,843 --> 00:28:23,303
(Se Chan goes first.)

750
00:28:23,303 --> 00:28:25,213
- Start. - Say something to the president.

751
00:28:25,213 --> 00:28:26,773
I love Na Eun.

752
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:28,883
(I love Na Eun.)

753
00:28:29,683 --> 00:28:30,683
I love Na Eun.

754
00:28:30,983 --> 00:28:32,113
What?

755
00:28:32,113 --> 00:28:33,753
I said, "I love Na Eun."

756
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,323
(He declared his love in front of the whole nation.)

757
00:28:35,323 --> 00:28:38,253
- You could say that to him. - To the president...

758
00:28:38,693 --> 00:28:41,923
(I see, Se Chan.)

759
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:44,293
I confessed my feelings anyway.

760
00:28:44,733 --> 00:28:45,733
(I confessed my feelings.)

761
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:46,733
Good job.

762
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:48,603
(Even the president knows about his love now.)

763
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:50,233
Next, Na Eun.

764
00:28:50,233 --> 00:28:51,333
It's Na Eun's turn.

765
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:53,873
Ready, start.

766
00:28:53,873 --> 00:28:55,103
Say something to your fans in English.

767
00:28:55,103 --> 00:28:56,703
I don't think so.

768
00:28:56,703 --> 00:28:58,413
- Who do you want to travel with? - Red.

769
00:28:58,413 --> 00:29:00,013
- Say something to your mother. - 4 times 2 equals 8.

770
00:29:01,843 --> 00:29:02,983
(Success)

771
00:29:02,983 --> 00:29:05,153
- You're so good. - Amazing.

772
00:29:05,153 --> 00:29:06,413
She's so smart.

773
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:07,923
(Someone is looking worried.)

774
00:29:08,983 --> 00:29:10,723
(Shaking eyes)

775
00:29:10,853 --> 00:29:15,923
(Na Eun makes it look so easy.)

776
00:29:17,393 --> 00:29:20,833
(Na Eun wins 5 dollars.)

777
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:21,933
Na Eun is so smart.

778
00:29:21,933 --> 00:29:23,133
- It's Hang Ho's turn. - Hang Ho.

779
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:25,503
Hold on. I'm so good at giving answers.

780
00:29:25,503 --> 00:29:26,933
- Say it right away. - Ready.

781
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:29,303
Start. Say something to your fans.

782
00:29:29,303 --> 00:29:30,303
I don't have any fans.

783
00:29:30,303 --> 00:29:32,413
(He's honest.)

784
00:29:32,413 --> 00:29:35,813
Gosh, wait.

785
00:29:36,243 --> 00:29:37,883
- What? - He...

786
00:29:37,883 --> 00:29:39,453
- doesn't understand the game. - He just answered the question.

787
00:29:39,483 --> 00:29:40,923
- Try again. - You answered the question.

788
00:29:40,923 --> 00:29:42,283
- "I don't have any fans." - Try again, Hang Ho.

789
00:29:42,283 --> 00:29:44,953
- Let's give him another chance. - He doesn't have any fans.

790
00:29:44,953 --> 00:29:46,293
He revealed his weakness.

791
00:29:46,693 --> 00:29:48,023
Try again, Hang Ho.

792
00:29:48,093 --> 00:29:49,123
Hold on.

793
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:50,663
(Hang Ho gets another chance.)

794
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,963
Okay. I'm ready.

795
00:29:51,963 --> 00:29:54,533
Ready, start. What was your childhood nickname?

796
00:29:54,533 --> 00:29:56,163
To be or not to be, that is the question.

797
00:29:56,233 --> 00:29:57,803
- Say something to Kwang Soo's dad. - Hamlet.

798
00:29:58,303 --> 00:30:00,203
(Fail)

799
00:30:01,543 --> 00:30:03,873
You could call him Hamlet.

800
00:30:03,873 --> 00:30:05,843
(You could call him Hamlet.)

801
00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:08,213
- I mean Hamlet. - You don't know Hamlet?

802
00:30:08,213 --> 00:30:09,883
Hamlet.

803
00:30:09,883 --> 00:30:11,113
- Hamlet. - Hamlet.

804
00:30:11,113 --> 00:30:12,453
- Hamlet. - Hamlet.

805
00:30:12,453 --> 00:30:14,223
He calls my dad Hamlet?

806
00:30:14,223 --> 00:30:15,623
Hamlet?

807
00:30:15,653 --> 00:30:18,623
- He could call him Hamlet. - Of course.

808
00:30:18,623 --> 00:30:20,293
- Hamlet. - Hamlet...

809
00:30:20,323 --> 00:30:21,593
It's hard.

810
00:30:21,593 --> 00:30:22,763
Hang Ho, try again.

811
00:30:23,023 --> 00:30:24,033
Ready.

812
00:30:24,463 --> 00:30:26,833
Start. What was your childhood nickname?

813
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:27,833
Four seasons.

814
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:29,963
(Four seasons)

815
00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:31,133
(That's a pretty nickname.)

816
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:32,133
Hey.

817
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:33,733
He's so bad at this game.

818
00:30:33,733 --> 00:30:35,403
- You're so bad. - It could be your nickname.

819
00:30:35,403 --> 00:30:36,543
It could be your nickname.

820
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,713
Spring, summer, fall, and winter.

821
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:38,873
My nickname was One Season.

822
00:30:38,873 --> 00:30:40,543
(My nickname was One Season.)

823
00:30:40,783 --> 00:30:41,983
Fail.

824
00:30:42,413 --> 00:30:43,843
- Kwang Soo. - Ready.

825
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:46,513
Start. What role do you want to play?

826
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:49,523
"Souvenirs Entomologiques".

827
00:30:49,523 --> 00:30:53,523
(Do you want to play an insect?)

828
00:30:54,163 --> 00:30:56,293
You want to play an insect after a fish?

829
00:30:56,293 --> 00:30:57,963
- It's a book. - Hey.

830
00:30:57,963 --> 00:31:00,193
An insect after a fish?

831
00:31:00,703 --> 00:31:02,563
You look like a long-headed grasshopper.

832
00:31:02,563 --> 00:31:04,973
What are you talking about?

833
00:31:04,973 --> 00:31:06,733
It's Sae Ho's turn now.

834
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,073
Are you ready?

835
00:31:09,443 --> 00:31:10,573
I'm very ready.

836
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:11,813
- Are you ready? - Yes.

837
00:31:11,813 --> 00:31:13,413
- He's ready. - Here we go.

838
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,013
- Sae Ho is very clever. - Ready.

839
00:31:15,243 --> 00:31:17,883
Start. What do you have in your fridge right now?

840
00:31:17,883 --> 00:31:18,883
Quadratic formula.

841
00:31:19,353 --> 00:31:21,223
- What dream did your mom have? - Law of universal gravitation.

842
00:31:21,623 --> 00:31:23,483
(Fail)

843
00:31:23,723 --> 00:31:25,223
- That makes sense. - Law of universal gravitation?

844
00:31:25,223 --> 00:31:28,823
(She had a very scientific dream.)

845
00:31:28,823 --> 00:31:32,093
She probably had a dream where the earth gets drawn.

846
00:31:33,863 --> 00:31:38,433
(Please give me a son who will become a comedian.)

847
00:31:38,703 --> 00:31:41,103
What kind of mother would have a dream like that?

848
00:31:41,103 --> 00:31:42,503
It's possible.

849
00:31:42,503 --> 00:31:44,243
- Try again. - I'll try again.

850
00:31:44,243 --> 00:31:45,713
- I can do this! - You can do this.

851
00:31:45,713 --> 00:31:47,043
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

852
00:31:47,043 --> 00:31:48,513
- All right. - Ready.

853
00:31:49,043 --> 00:31:50,683
Start.

854
00:31:50,683 --> 00:31:52,253
- What will you be in 10 years? - Chicory.

855
00:31:52,253 --> 00:31:54,823
(He wants to be a vegetable.)

856
00:31:54,823 --> 00:31:57,353
His stage name used to be Cabbage.

857
00:31:57,453 --> 00:31:59,493
Now, he's Cho Sae Ho. He'll become Chicory later.

858
00:31:59,493 --> 00:32:01,763
Cabbage, Cho Sae Ho,

859
00:32:01,763 --> 00:32:03,223
and then Chicory.

860
00:32:03,493 --> 00:32:05,233
I can't do this.

861
00:32:05,233 --> 00:32:07,033
(I can't do this.)

862
00:32:07,033 --> 00:32:08,303
(Sae Ho gives up the game.)

863
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:09,303
I can't do this.

864
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:10,703
You're so bad at this.

865
00:32:10,703 --> 00:32:12,233
We gave you so many chances.

866
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:14,743
- Why do you fail every time? - What's with you?

867
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:17,143
Why do you talk to me like that?

868
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,673
I'm just sad.

869
00:32:18,673 --> 00:32:20,043
(Why do you talk to me like that?)

870
00:32:20,443 --> 00:32:21,613
(I'm just cheering you up.)

871
00:32:21,613 --> 00:32:24,253
I'm just cheering you up. You failed again.

872
00:32:24,353 --> 00:32:27,083
Sae Ho can't say more than...

873
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:28,323
- 100 words a day. - Yes.

874
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:29,853
I'll try again. I'm so offended.

875
00:32:29,853 --> 00:32:30,853
Here we go.

876
00:32:30,853 --> 00:32:32,753
Ready, start.

877
00:32:32,753 --> 00:32:34,823
- What was your childhood nickname? - Department store.

878
00:32:35,623 --> 00:32:36,623
What was your childhood nickname?

879
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:38,333
(Sae Ho fails.)

880
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,393
I can explain.

881
00:32:40,463 --> 00:32:42,833
Sae Ho's family was rich. He went shopping often.

882
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:43,833
That's why.

883
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:45,473
My nickname was Police Station.

884
00:32:45,473 --> 00:32:47,743
You don't want to give me the money, do you?

885
00:32:47,743 --> 00:32:50,303
(You don't want to give me the money, do you?)

886
00:32:50,303 --> 00:32:51,943
- I just want to make sure. - Don't be like that.

887
00:32:51,943 --> 00:32:53,343
Na Eun got the money.

888
00:32:53,343 --> 00:32:54,343
Na Eun got it.

889
00:32:54,343 --> 00:32:55,843
She got it.

890
00:32:55,843 --> 00:32:57,953
Oh, she got it.

891
00:32:57,953 --> 00:32:58,953
Just admit it.

892
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:00,383
It's my turn.

893
00:33:01,123 --> 00:33:02,123
Ready.

894
00:33:02,553 --> 00:33:04,193
- Look how I do it. - Start.

895
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:06,453
- What is in your washing machine? - Where do you live?

896
00:33:06,453 --> 00:33:07,693
What do you do first thing in the morning?

897
00:33:07,693 --> 00:33:11,663
Where is it?

898
00:33:11,663 --> 00:33:13,293
What's that?

899
00:33:13,293 --> 00:33:15,203
(What is that?)

900
00:33:15,203 --> 00:33:16,863
- Jae Seok. - What are you doing?

901
00:33:16,863 --> 00:33:19,473
- What are you doing? - Don't stall in the beginning.

902
00:33:19,803 --> 00:33:21,773
What's that?

903
00:33:21,773 --> 00:33:23,303
There's nothing wrong with it.

904
00:33:23,303 --> 00:33:25,243
You speak so slowly.

905
00:33:25,243 --> 00:33:26,613
Anyone could do that.

906
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:28,713
- I'm speechless. - You shouldn't do that.

907
00:33:28,713 --> 00:33:30,443
It's not okay.

908
00:33:30,713 --> 00:33:32,983
He says, "Where am I?", when he wakes up.

909
00:33:32,983 --> 00:33:34,023
(He says, "Where am I?", when he wakes up.)

910
00:33:34,953 --> 00:33:36,953
- What am I doing? - Where are we going?

911
00:33:36,953 --> 00:33:38,393
Where does that dialect come from?

912
00:33:39,193 --> 00:33:41,323
- Soo Yong will go first. - Soo Yong.

913
00:33:41,323 --> 00:33:42,623
(Soo Yong tries.)

914
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:45,463
Which member did you want to see the most?

915
00:33:45,463 --> 00:33:46,493
Sausage stew.

916
00:33:46,763 --> 00:33:48,103
When was your happiest moment today?

917
00:33:48,103 --> 00:33:49,133
A cow.

918
00:33:50,203 --> 00:33:51,733
- What is your hobby? - Hair loss.

919
00:33:51,733 --> 00:33:54,403
(Hair loss)

920
00:33:56,043 --> 00:34:00,883
(Is your hobby getting bald?)

921
00:34:00,883 --> 00:34:03,343
He loses his hair as a hobby.

922
00:34:04,713 --> 00:34:10,183
(Soo Yong enjoyed his hobby thanks to Geun Sik.)

923
00:34:10,623 --> 00:34:12,653
Does that make sense?

924
00:34:12,653 --> 00:34:14,123
His hobby is losing hair.

925
00:34:14,123 --> 00:34:17,333
Most things make sense.

926
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:19,793
- Most things make sense. - All right.

927
00:34:19,793 --> 00:34:21,703
All right. Here we go.

928
00:34:22,403 --> 00:34:24,333
- Who does Soul look like? - This guy is so unlucky.

929
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,573
- What do you want to give Dream? - 5 times 3 equals 15.

930
00:34:26,573 --> 00:34:28,573
- Say something to Mother-in-law. - I'm pretty.

931
00:34:30,143 --> 00:34:31,143
I'm pretty.

932
00:34:31,143 --> 00:34:33,643
(Haha fails.)

933
00:34:34,843 --> 00:34:36,013
What?

934
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:39,883
- "I'm pretty?" - "I'm pretty."

935
00:34:39,883 --> 00:34:41,223
Mother, I'm pretty.

936
00:34:41,223 --> 00:34:43,653
(You know I'm pretty, right?)

937
00:34:44,593 --> 00:34:46,293
- Is it hard? - Yes.

938
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:47,423
- It is? - Yes.

939
00:34:47,423 --> 00:34:48,593
(Is it hard?)

940
00:34:48,593 --> 00:34:49,923
(It is.)

941
00:34:50,563 --> 00:34:53,593
(I've failed too many times.)

942
00:34:53,593 --> 00:34:55,603
(I'll succeed this time.)

943
00:34:55,603 --> 00:34:57,933
- What is Haha's weakness? - Elephant poop is huge.

944
00:34:57,933 --> 00:35:00,603
- What do you want to get Haha? - Your shoelaces have come untied.

945
00:35:00,773 --> 00:35:02,043
What do you want to eat right now?

946
00:35:02,103 --> 00:35:04,813
(The last question is what he wants to eat.)

947
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:08,583
(If he can do it right, he'll succeed for the first time.)

948
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:10,583
Grapes.

949
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:11,983
(Grapes)

950
00:35:11,983 --> 00:35:13,013
Gosh.

951
00:35:13,713 --> 00:35:17,653
(I've been craving grapes today.)

952
00:35:17,823 --> 00:35:18,953
He was almost there.

953
00:35:19,193 --> 00:35:21,123
- That was so close. - That was so close.

954
00:35:21,123 --> 00:35:22,523
Did you want to eat grapes?

955
00:35:22,523 --> 00:35:24,363
You were doing great before that.

956
00:35:24,463 --> 00:35:25,893
I'm craving something sweet.

957
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,403
- He wanted grapes. - Yes.

958
00:35:28,403 --> 00:35:30,003
- Okay. - Give him an easy one.

959
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,773
- Let's go, Geun Sik. - Let's go.

960
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:33,973
What's the most recent lie you told?

961
00:35:34,273 --> 00:35:35,543
I like my family.

962
00:35:35,543 --> 00:35:38,173
(His answer is "I like my family.")

963
00:35:38,173 --> 00:35:43,443
(His answer turns out to be meaningful.)

964
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:47,183
(Geun Sik fails yet again.)

965
00:35:47,183 --> 00:35:48,223
- Family? - Family.

966
00:35:48,223 --> 00:35:50,053
- What are you thinking? - Is that a lie?

967
00:35:50,453 --> 00:35:54,463
(Will Geun Sik succeed in anything today?)

968
00:35:55,423 --> 00:35:57,893
The bus will stop at some point.

969
00:35:57,893 --> 00:35:59,433
(The buses get closer to the destinations.)

970
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:02,833
If the bus stops at the restaurant, you may enter it.

971
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:04,173
(They eat without clearing any missions.)

972
00:36:04,173 --> 00:36:06,303
If it stops at a museum,

973
00:36:06,603 --> 00:36:08,273
you may start the mission.

974
00:36:08,573 --> 00:36:10,503
- We have to start running then. - Do we have two Meal Cards?

975
00:36:10,913 --> 00:36:12,113
You only have two.

976
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:15,083
Will this bus be a hit or a miss?

977
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:16,343
What will it be?

978
00:36:18,013 --> 00:36:19,753
I hope my team gets lucky.

979
00:36:19,753 --> 00:36:21,553
(Will the bus head to a fish stew restaurant?)

980
00:36:21,553 --> 00:36:23,583
We're on the same bus as Kwang Soo.

981
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:25,093
(Or to a chicken soup restaurant?)

982
00:36:25,493 --> 00:36:29,163
The bus you chose will go...

983
00:36:29,393 --> 00:36:30,663
directly to the restaurant.

984
00:36:30,663 --> 00:36:32,793
(The 4 teams head directly to a chicken soup restaurant.)

985
00:36:33,393 --> 00:36:37,573
(It's time to eat chicken soup, everyone.)

986
00:36:38,003 --> 00:36:40,133
- That's great. - I'm so happy.

987
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:41,143
I'm so happy.

988
00:36:41,143 --> 00:36:42,473
You may enjoy your meals.

989
00:36:42,473 --> 00:36:44,413
(Their chicken soup feast starts.)

990
00:36:44,413 --> 00:36:46,313
We got lucky today.

991
00:36:46,713 --> 00:36:47,743
(Those who find Meal Cards...)

992
00:36:47,743 --> 00:36:51,753
Food is provided only to the 1st 2 teams to find the Meal Cards.

993
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:53,953
- Don't lie to us. - Goodness.

994
00:36:53,953 --> 00:36:54,983
(They must find Meal Cards.)

995
00:36:55,483 --> 00:36:59,523
(They arrive at a museum.)

996
00:37:00,223 --> 00:37:01,923
I really wanted chicken soup.

997
00:37:02,593 --> 00:37:05,293
Your mission will start now.

998
00:37:05,363 --> 00:37:06,433
The mission starts now.

999
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:07,963
(They look for Meal Cards.)

1000
00:37:08,903 --> 00:37:09,903
My goodness.

1001
00:37:09,903 --> 00:37:11,003
(There are only 2 Meal Cards.)

1002
00:37:11,003 --> 00:37:12,303
Geun Sik, let's split.

1003
00:37:12,303 --> 00:37:15,143
(They must find Meal Cards within five minutes to eat.)

1004
00:37:15,143 --> 00:37:16,703
Could they be anywhere?

1005
00:37:16,703 --> 00:37:18,643
(Jeongok S Museum was built at Jeongok, a prehistoric relic site.)

1006
00:37:18,643 --> 00:37:19,913
Where could they be?

1007
00:37:19,913 --> 00:37:21,713
(It's full of relics related to the prehistoric age.)

1008
00:37:21,713 --> 00:37:23,313
One team member has to find it.

1009
00:37:23,713 --> 00:37:25,153
Soo Yong, we must find it.

1010
00:37:25,513 --> 00:37:27,423
(Could it be here?)

1011
00:37:27,423 --> 00:37:28,553
- Sung Moon. - Yes?

1012
00:37:28,753 --> 00:37:30,223
I don't think it'll be there.

1013
00:37:31,093 --> 00:37:32,723
There are no cameras here.

1014
00:37:32,723 --> 00:37:34,593
(She's experienced.)

1015
00:37:35,023 --> 00:37:37,963
(Ji Hyo is an experienced member.)

1016
00:37:37,963 --> 00:37:42,163
(She searches places where it's most likely to find them.)

1017
00:37:42,933 --> 00:37:44,033
Goodness.

1018
00:37:44,373 --> 00:37:45,573
I really want to eat it.

1019
00:37:45,573 --> 00:37:47,373
(What is Haha up to?)

1020
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:50,003
(Is that a Meal Card?)

1021
00:37:50,243 --> 00:37:54,683
(He almost passes it, but finds it by instinct.)

1022
00:37:56,743 --> 00:37:58,513
(I knew I'd find it.)

1023
00:37:58,513 --> 00:38:01,053
Did you find it? Where is it?

1024
00:38:01,053 --> 00:38:03,483
(Wait for me, mandarin fish.)

1025
00:38:04,693 --> 00:38:05,753
That's impressive.

1026
00:38:05,753 --> 00:38:10,563
(However, Soo Yong and Seok Jin wander about without finding any.)

1027
00:38:10,563 --> 00:38:11,963
Where did he find it?

1028
00:38:13,763 --> 00:38:14,833
It's not it.

1029
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:16,863
(What he finds is a dud.)

1030
00:38:16,863 --> 00:38:17,903
It's a dud.

1031
00:38:18,403 --> 00:38:19,673
I bet it's around here.

1032
00:38:21,073 --> 00:38:24,443
(Experienced Ji Hyo spots something.)

1033
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:30,953
(Did she find a real Meal Card?)

1034
00:38:31,453 --> 00:38:34,923
(As she's lucky, she finds a Meal Card.)

1035
00:38:35,623 --> 00:38:38,023
(Sung Moon, I'll buy you fish stew.)

1036
00:38:38,023 --> 00:38:39,023
Sung Moon.

1037
00:38:39,423 --> 00:38:40,453
Did you find it?

1038
00:38:41,463 --> 00:38:42,763
(Stay quiet.)

1039
00:38:42,763 --> 00:38:44,693
- Did you find it? - I found it.

1040
00:38:44,933 --> 00:38:45,993
I found it.

1041
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:48,033
Someone else will find the other one.

1042
00:38:48,933 --> 00:38:51,803
(The Meal Card mission is over.)

1043
00:38:51,803 --> 00:38:53,203
Time is up.

1044
00:38:53,773 --> 00:38:54,943
We're doomed.

1045
00:38:55,773 --> 00:38:57,243
(The others return empty-handed.)

1046
00:38:57,243 --> 00:38:58,773
- Did you find it, Soo Yong? - No.

1047
00:38:59,613 --> 00:39:00,743
I didn't find one.

1048
00:39:00,883 --> 00:39:02,083
Who found it?

1049
00:39:02,243 --> 00:39:03,413
- Let's eat. - Is it Ji Hyo?

1050
00:39:03,413 --> 00:39:05,683
(Let's eat, Jong Kook.)

1051
00:39:07,853 --> 00:39:09,683
(A few minutes ago)

1052
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:15,123
(Jong Myung searched everywhere in the museum meticulously.)

1053
00:39:15,123 --> 00:39:17,863
(He found something in the tree.)

1054
00:39:18,063 --> 00:39:19,133
(He grabbed something.)

1055
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:21,003
(He remains quiet.)

1056
00:39:21,003 --> 00:39:22,103
Will this be right?

1057
00:39:22,103 --> 00:39:24,403
(He remains quiet until the mission is over.)

1058
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,873
Let's go.

1059
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:27,473
(He's competent like Jong Kook.)

1060
00:39:27,473 --> 00:39:28,673
He found one.

1061
00:39:28,673 --> 00:39:30,973
- Did he find it? - Jong Myung found one.

1062
00:39:31,313 --> 00:39:32,673
He's hilarious.

1063
00:39:32,943 --> 00:39:34,083
He told me, "Let's eat."

1064
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,643
(Jong Kook is impressed.)

1065
00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:38,453
- It felt like a horror movie. - It's because he's hungry.

1066
00:39:38,753 --> 00:39:40,783
Team Jong Kook and Team Ji Hyo...

1067
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:42,723
will eat.

1068
00:39:43,053 --> 00:39:45,893
- The others will watch them eat. - Okay.

1069
00:39:45,893 --> 00:39:47,053
Let's go to the restaurant.

1070
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:49,123
(Team Haha and Team Seok Jin are forced to be on a diet.)

1071
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:50,833
(At a chicken soup restaurant)

1072
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:52,063
We finally get to eat.

1073
00:39:52,363 --> 00:39:54,633
- Do you smell it? - It smells delicious.

1074
00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:55,863
- It smells good. - Goodness.

1075
00:39:55,863 --> 00:39:57,163
It's going to be delicious.

1076
00:39:57,163 --> 00:39:58,633
Kwang Soo, this is amazing.

1077
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:00,003
This is authentic.

1078
00:40:00,633 --> 00:40:01,673
It's nutritious.

1079
00:40:01,673 --> 00:40:03,603
(It's a chicken soup set for their 7th anniversary.)

1080
00:40:03,603 --> 00:40:05,113
It looks impressive.

1081
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:07,113
Thank you for the meal.

1082
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,313
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you for the meal.

1083
00:40:10,013 --> 00:40:11,113
Let's eat.

1084
00:40:11,113 --> 00:40:13,083
(I'll debone the chicken for you.)

1085
00:40:13,613 --> 00:40:14,753
Goodness.

1086
00:40:14,753 --> 00:40:16,653
(What a lucky day.)

1087
00:40:16,983 --> 00:40:19,353
The chef did a good job cooking the chicken.

1088
00:40:19,353 --> 00:40:21,363
- It's so tender. - Isn't it?

1089
00:40:21,363 --> 00:40:23,393
The soup is amazing too.

1090
00:40:25,033 --> 00:40:26,063
It's hot.

1091
00:40:26,063 --> 00:40:29,403
(He devours a chicken leg.)

1092
00:40:31,073 --> 00:40:32,633
You ate both chicken legs.

1093
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:34,703
No, there's one left.

1094
00:40:34,703 --> 00:40:36,003
(Jae Seok finds him greedy.)

1095
00:40:36,003 --> 00:40:38,243
(He denies it.)

1096
00:40:38,713 --> 00:40:40,013
There's one left.

1097
00:40:40,013 --> 00:40:41,983
(There are only bones left.)

1098
00:40:41,983 --> 00:40:43,213
Where did it go?

1099
00:40:43,213 --> 00:40:44,813
- There is one left. - Let me see.

1100
00:40:44,813 --> 00:40:45,913
I only had one.

1101
00:40:46,053 --> 00:40:48,123
Did you leave the bones after you finished?

1102
00:40:48,223 --> 00:40:50,553
- No, I didn't. - What?

1103
00:40:50,553 --> 00:40:52,453
(He's flustered.)

1104
00:40:52,723 --> 00:40:54,893
Did you eat from our pot?

1105
00:40:54,893 --> 00:40:56,193
(What do you mean?)

1106
00:40:56,193 --> 00:40:57,433
I only had one.

1107
00:40:57,993 --> 00:41:01,833
(He denies after eating it unconsciously.)

1108
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:04,633
- I'm telling the truth. - You have something on here.

1109
00:41:04,633 --> 00:41:05,973
- Where? - It's on the other side.

1110
00:41:06,803 --> 00:41:07,803
I only had one.

1111
00:41:07,803 --> 00:41:11,043
- The meat is at the bottom. - Eat it.

1112
00:41:11,043 --> 00:41:12,813
- Wasn't it a bug? - Was it?

1113
00:41:12,813 --> 00:41:15,443
(Didn't he eat a bug?)

1114
00:41:15,443 --> 00:41:16,513
Was it a bug?

1115
00:41:16,913 --> 00:41:18,513
- Did you eat it? - It wasn't a bug.

1116
00:41:18,883 --> 00:41:20,253
- It was a bug. - Was it?

1117
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:23,383
- It seemed like a bug. - Was it really a bug?

1118
00:41:23,653 --> 00:41:25,423
- Was that it? - Did you eat a bug?

1119
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:27,593
Wasn't that the bug?

1120
00:41:27,593 --> 00:41:29,123
(Did he eat a fly?)

1121
00:41:29,263 --> 00:41:30,423
I'll digest it.

1122
00:41:30,423 --> 00:41:32,633
(A bug is a source of protein after all.)

1123
00:41:33,093 --> 00:41:34,133
Come in.

1124
00:41:34,133 --> 00:41:36,663
Team Seok Jin and Haha are on the left.

1125
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:39,473
- This looks delicious. - Look at that.

1126
00:41:39,473 --> 00:41:40,633
(They're buckwheat crepe and fried crab.)

1127
00:41:40,633 --> 00:41:43,003
There are crabs and fried food.

1128
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:44,373
It looks amazing.

1129
00:41:44,373 --> 00:41:45,473
There are fried crabs.

1130
00:41:45,573 --> 00:41:46,713
Let's start.

1131
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:48,743
Everything looks delicious.

1132
00:41:49,243 --> 00:41:52,853
Gosh, food on our table makes me sad.

1133
00:41:52,853 --> 00:41:53,953
(It's a minimum food amount.)

1134
00:41:55,123 --> 00:41:56,853
I don't feel the shell at all.

1135
00:41:56,983 --> 00:41:58,553
- Is it tender? - Yes.

1136
00:41:58,723 --> 00:42:00,523
- Isn't it delicious? - Yes.

1137
00:42:00,523 --> 00:42:01,693
(He wants at least a drop of the stew.)

1138
00:42:01,923 --> 00:42:03,193
Ji Hyo.

1139
00:42:03,193 --> 00:42:05,033
- Yes? - Can u sell a crab for a dollar?

1140
00:42:05,033 --> 00:42:06,663
- Do you mean the fried crabs? - Yes.

1141
00:42:06,863 --> 00:42:08,203
- For a dollar. - A dollar?

1142
00:42:08,903 --> 00:42:11,073
On top of that, we'll show a personal charm.

1143
00:42:11,203 --> 00:42:12,403
- A personal charm? - Yes.

1144
00:42:12,773 --> 00:42:13,833
Show us.

1145
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:16,103
I can catch this bowl of rice.

1146
00:42:16,103 --> 00:42:18,973
(He'll toss and catch a bowl of rice.)

1147
00:42:18,973 --> 00:42:20,313
I bet you've never seen it.

1148
00:42:20,683 --> 00:42:22,383
(He's being serious.)

1149
00:42:22,383 --> 00:42:26,853
(His personal charm with a rice bowl has never been shown.)

1150
00:42:26,853 --> 00:42:31,093
(Will he impress her and win a fried crab?)

1151
00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:32,693
(He misses it.)

1152
00:42:33,423 --> 00:42:38,093
(Unfortunately, the rice falls on the table.)

1153
00:42:38,093 --> 00:42:39,333
We'll eat it anyway.

1154
00:42:41,363 --> 00:42:43,003
Were you supposed to catch it with your hands?

1155
00:42:43,003 --> 00:42:44,273
(You don't deserve fried crabs.)

1156
00:42:45,373 --> 00:42:48,973
Geun Sik can mimic the voice of a detective from "Tazza".

1157
00:42:49,003 --> 00:42:51,173
He'll do it for two pieces of buckwheat crepe.

1158
00:42:51,173 --> 00:42:52,313
(He asks for buckwheat crepe.)

1159
00:42:52,843 --> 00:42:57,713
(Will Geun Sik mimic such a famous line from "Tazza"?)

1160
00:42:57,713 --> 00:42:59,813
He'll do it for two pieces of buckwheat crepe.

1161
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:01,523
I know what it is.

1162
00:43:01,653 --> 00:43:03,523
I've never done it before.

1163
00:43:03,523 --> 00:43:05,793
(He's never done it before.)

1164
00:43:05,793 --> 00:43:07,323
How can I do it all of a sudden?

1165
00:43:07,623 --> 00:43:09,593
- Do it standing up. - You've never done it before?

1166
00:43:09,593 --> 00:43:11,363
Do it with modesty.

1167
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:13,633
They'll give it to you out of pity.

1168
00:43:14,503 --> 00:43:15,863
I can't wait to see it, Geun Sik.

1169
00:43:16,563 --> 00:43:18,433
Do it with modesty.

1170
00:43:18,673 --> 00:43:19,733
If he does a good job,

1171
00:43:19,733 --> 00:43:22,203
Jong Kook should give him buckwheat crepe.

1172
00:43:22,203 --> 00:43:23,303
Sure.

1173
00:43:24,113 --> 00:43:30,413
(He gives it a try for 2 pieces of buckwheat crepe.)

1174
00:43:30,413 --> 00:43:33,213
(He's been failing all day. Will he surprise everyone?)

1175
00:43:33,213 --> 00:43:35,853
Agui got off before that.

1176
00:43:35,853 --> 00:43:37,923
There was a game in Nonsan.

1177
00:43:39,493 --> 00:43:40,893
"Over there..."

1178
00:43:40,893 --> 00:43:45,893
(Which line is that?)

1179
00:43:46,433 --> 00:43:50,803
(There's no such line in that movie.)

1180
00:43:50,803 --> 00:43:52,473
Geun Sik.

1181
00:43:53,203 --> 00:43:54,943
Say something more.

1182
00:43:54,943 --> 00:43:56,443
I've never done it before.

1183
00:43:56,443 --> 00:43:58,113
- It was so sudden. - Do it one more time.

1184
00:43:58,173 --> 00:44:00,273
Isn't that the voice of your father?

1185
00:44:00,273 --> 00:44:03,213
(Are you mimicking your father?)

1186
00:44:03,283 --> 00:44:05,083
- Seriously. - Listen, everyone.

1187
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:07,453
Do it one more time. Do it once more.

1188
00:44:07,453 --> 00:44:08,523
I don't know what to say.

1189
00:44:08,523 --> 00:44:10,793
It's not such a big deal.

1190
00:44:11,653 --> 00:44:13,153
- All right. - Okay.

1191
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:15,493
- Okay. - Will it require strength?

1192
00:44:15,493 --> 00:44:17,693
Let's not be penalized today.

1193
00:44:18,033 --> 00:44:19,633
You're having a hard time today, aren't you?

1194
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:20,733
I'm tired.

1195
00:44:20,733 --> 00:44:22,133
What are you working on these days?

1196
00:44:22,133 --> 00:44:23,163
I'm so tired.

1197
00:44:23,463 --> 00:44:24,603
It feels like...

1198
00:44:25,273 --> 00:44:26,633
we've spent several days together.

1199
00:44:27,403 --> 00:44:29,673
- That's true. - It feels like a week.

1200
00:44:29,673 --> 00:44:31,673
- I feel like we spent a night. - I know.

1201
00:44:31,673 --> 00:44:33,243
- Is the shoot usually like this? - What?

1202
00:44:33,243 --> 00:44:34,683
Do you usually shoot like this?

1203
00:44:34,683 --> 00:44:36,513
- No. - Is that so?

1204
00:44:36,513 --> 00:44:38,113
Take a look at Soo Yong.

1205
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:40,583
(He appears.)

1206
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:43,083
He's about to collapse.

1207
00:44:43,383 --> 00:44:45,323
- Can we get an IV? - He's about to die.

1208
00:44:45,923 --> 00:44:47,193
I need medication.

1209
00:44:48,093 --> 00:44:49,393
I need medication.

1210
00:44:49,393 --> 00:44:50,733
What are you talking about?

1211
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:52,993
The color of his face looks terrible.

1212
00:44:53,293 --> 00:44:56,403
Next mission is called Pull Out the Radishes.

1213
00:44:56,403 --> 00:44:58,103
(Pull Out the Radishes)

1214
00:44:58,103 --> 00:44:59,333
It's called Pull Out the Radishes.

1215
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:00,633
- Pull Out the Radishes? - Pull Out the Radishes.

1216
00:45:00,873 --> 00:45:02,803
It's a team competition.

1217
00:45:03,173 --> 00:45:06,213
The defense team lies down with their arms linked.

1218
00:45:06,673 --> 00:45:09,843
Two members of the attacking team must pull...

1219
00:45:09,843 --> 00:45:13,183
the other team members off of the mat to succeed.

1220
00:45:13,953 --> 00:45:16,083
After two members pull them out,

1221
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:18,423
the other two will take their turns.

1222
00:45:18,423 --> 00:45:20,823
- Heavy people have an advantage. - Teams will switch roles.

1223
00:45:20,823 --> 00:45:24,093
The team to pull out the other team more quickly wins.

1224
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:27,433
Each team has one chance to pass their turn.

1225
00:45:27,563 --> 00:45:29,033
The winning team...

1226
00:45:29,103 --> 00:45:32,103
gets 10 dollars and a member exchange opportunity.

1227
00:45:32,103 --> 00:45:34,003
- Member exchange? - A chance to exchange?

1228
00:45:34,003 --> 00:45:39,173
(The winning team gets to exchange a member?)

1229
00:45:39,173 --> 00:45:41,313
Do we have to exchange a member with a lot of money?

1230
00:45:41,313 --> 00:45:43,883
We invited guests to join us,

1231
00:45:43,883 --> 00:45:46,753
so how do you exchange your real family?

1232
00:45:47,213 --> 00:45:48,623
You can do this.

1233
00:45:48,623 --> 00:45:50,853
I don't think you can exchange a real family member.

1234
00:45:50,853 --> 00:45:52,553
- Isn't that hurtful? - You have to make a decision.

1235
00:45:52,553 --> 00:45:54,293
(Will he guard his family...)

1236
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,823
(or go for the win?)

1237
00:45:57,063 --> 00:45:58,993
We have to divide up the teams first.

1238
00:45:59,433 --> 00:46:01,533
Jong Kook is strong.

1239
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:03,133
- Wook Min is strong. - Wook Min is strong too.

1240
00:46:03,133 --> 00:46:05,673
The two of you can do rock, paper, scissors, and pick team members.

1241
00:46:05,673 --> 00:46:06,673
- Me. - Okay.

1242
00:46:06,673 --> 00:46:07,743
Isn't that team...

1243
00:46:07,743 --> 00:46:10,043
- stronger? - I like that team...

1244
00:46:10,043 --> 00:46:12,073
- or this team. - That team is good.

1245
00:46:12,073 --> 00:46:13,713
- I like that team. - Kwang Soo's team is good.

1246
00:46:13,713 --> 00:46:15,383
Pick heavy people.

1247
00:46:15,383 --> 00:46:16,883
- Pick heavy people. - From there?

1248
00:46:16,883 --> 00:46:18,453
- Yes, from that side. - How much do you weigh?

1249
00:46:18,453 --> 00:46:19,553
I weigh 100kg.

1250
00:46:21,323 --> 00:46:22,553
He doesn't look that big.

1251
00:46:22,553 --> 00:46:23,683
(He must have 100kg of muscles.)

1252
00:46:23,683 --> 00:46:25,123
- You weigh 100kg? - Yes.

1253
00:46:25,123 --> 00:46:27,023
Hang Ho and Wook Min weigh the same.

1254
00:46:27,253 --> 00:46:28,863
- He's 100kg. - I am.

1255
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,423
- He weighs 100kg too. - Does he?

1256
00:46:30,423 --> 00:46:33,363
(Hang Ho is 100kg too.)

1257
00:46:33,363 --> 00:46:34,933
- I'm not. I don't weigh that much. - You don't?

1258
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:37,533
- How much do you weigh? - 96kg.

1259
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:39,333
He's 96kg.

1260
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:41,273
(He's 4kg lighter.)

1261
00:46:41,273 --> 00:46:42,473
He's 96kg?

1262
00:46:42,773 --> 00:46:44,373
Please get started.

1263
00:46:44,473 --> 00:46:45,773
Rock, paper, scissors

1264
00:46:46,673 --> 00:46:48,713
(Jong Kook is the winner, and he chooses...)

1265
00:46:48,713 --> 00:46:52,213
Kwang Soo. Our youngest member.

1266
00:46:52,213 --> 00:46:53,653
(Kwang Soo and Hang Ho are heavy and tall.)

1267
00:46:53,653 --> 00:46:55,283
- Great. - Jong Kook.

1268
00:46:55,283 --> 00:46:57,083
You're strong.

1269
00:46:57,253 --> 00:46:59,393
They're tall and heavy.

1270
00:47:00,393 --> 00:47:01,663
(Whom shall we choose?)

1271
00:47:01,663 --> 00:47:03,563
I pick Haha.

1272
00:47:04,063 --> 00:47:05,093
Okay.

1273
00:47:05,093 --> 00:47:08,963
(Haha and Geun Sik are witty and built.)

1274
00:47:08,963 --> 00:47:11,133
Haha is easy.

1275
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:13,833
We just need to get Haha. The rest will follow.

1276
00:47:14,243 --> 00:47:15,373
Okay.

1277
00:47:16,203 --> 00:47:17,813
Let's go. Rock, paper, scissors

1278
00:47:19,613 --> 00:47:22,843
He's consistent.

1279
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:23,983
Right?

1280
00:47:23,983 --> 00:47:25,053
(Wook Min pulls out scissors again.)

1281
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:27,383
I come from a family of strong people.

1282
00:47:27,383 --> 00:47:29,453
- Where did you do business? - In all sorts of places.

1283
00:47:29,453 --> 00:47:30,953
Really? I see.

1284
00:47:30,953 --> 00:47:32,593
- We were everywhere. - Oh, really?

1285
00:47:32,593 --> 00:47:34,893
I usually don't work under people.

1286
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,123
I know that.

1287
00:47:36,123 --> 00:47:37,263
- Do you want it? - All right.

1288
00:47:37,363 --> 00:47:38,533
Okay.

1289
00:47:39,463 --> 00:47:40,933
Yes.

1290
00:47:40,933 --> 00:47:41,963
Welcome.

1291
00:47:41,963 --> 00:47:42,963
Pick Seok Jin.

1292
00:47:42,963 --> 00:47:47,203
- I pick Seok Jin. - Yes. Let's go.

1293
00:47:47,203 --> 00:47:50,043
I can already see we're weak.

1294
00:47:50,043 --> 00:47:52,513
- We're already done. - No, we'll win.

1295
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:56,643
Rock, paper, scissors

1296
00:47:56,643 --> 00:47:58,453
(It's scissors for him once again.)

1297
00:47:58,453 --> 00:48:01,283
- See? He lost again. - Did you do scissors again?

1298
00:48:01,283 --> 00:48:03,083
Wook Min keeps on losing.

1299
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:04,623
- Did you do scissors again? - Yes.

1300
00:48:04,893 --> 00:48:07,153
- Wook Min keeps on losing. - He's stubborn.

1301
00:48:07,153 --> 00:48:08,663
What shall we do now?

1302
00:48:09,223 --> 00:48:11,363
- Well... - I pick Se Chan.

1303
00:48:11,363 --> 00:48:12,633
(Jong Kook picks Se Chan and Na Eun.)

1304
00:48:12,633 --> 00:48:13,863
Okay.

1305
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,233
- You didn't pick Ji Hyo? - This is bad.

1306
00:48:17,233 --> 00:48:19,273
You chose them instead of Ji Hyo?

1307
00:48:19,273 --> 00:48:20,433
Let's do this.

1308
00:48:20,433 --> 00:48:21,473
This is bad.

1309
00:48:21,703 --> 00:48:25,143
(Team Jong Kook and Team Wook Min have been made.)

1310
00:48:25,143 --> 00:48:26,743
Try to unlink me. I'll defend.

1311
00:48:27,213 --> 00:48:28,983
- This is enough. - Let me see.

1312
00:48:29,683 --> 00:48:31,683
- Is this okay? - It doesn't matter.

1313
00:48:31,683 --> 00:48:34,253
- You should hold onto me. - You have to get the hand off.

1314
00:48:34,253 --> 00:48:35,523
- Do it the other way. - You have to get the hand off.

1315
00:48:35,523 --> 00:48:36,953
Jong Kook.

1316
00:48:37,393 --> 00:48:38,993
We're on the same team.

1317
00:48:38,993 --> 00:48:40,353
- It's for practice. - You can't do that.

1318
00:48:40,353 --> 00:48:43,063
You have to get a feel of it.

1319
00:48:43,463 --> 00:48:44,833
(In pain)

1320
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:46,393
It hurts.

1321
00:48:46,393 --> 00:48:47,463
It's practice.

1322
00:48:47,463 --> 00:48:49,633
You have to know how it feels.

1323
00:48:49,633 --> 00:48:51,973
- That was just practice. - Practice?

1324
00:48:52,603 --> 00:48:55,673
- Lie down. - Do we lie down?

1325
00:48:55,673 --> 00:48:56,743
Lie down.

1326
00:48:57,103 --> 00:49:00,243
(They all lie down.)

1327
00:49:00,243 --> 00:49:02,183
What are you doing?

1328
00:49:02,183 --> 00:49:04,083
- Do I have to move sideways? - Wait. Move your arm.

1329
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:05,283
Where should I go?

1330
00:49:05,283 --> 00:49:06,853
- We have to get closer together. - Get close.

1331
00:49:06,953 --> 00:49:08,553
- Move left. - Stick together.

1332
00:49:08,553 --> 00:49:10,183
- Right or left? - Left.

1333
00:49:10,553 --> 00:49:11,593
Here's next.

1334
00:49:11,593 --> 00:49:13,693
- Na Eun is free. - Sorry?

1335
00:49:13,693 --> 00:49:15,393
- Na Eun is free. - I'm not.

1336
00:49:15,393 --> 00:49:17,893
- She won't be eliminated. - Really?

1337
00:49:17,963 --> 00:49:19,893
You have five minutes.

1338
00:49:20,463 --> 00:49:23,763
In five minutes, we'll count how many are out.

1339
00:49:23,803 --> 00:49:25,003
Stop.

1340
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:27,233
- I'll get them. - You go second.

1341
00:49:27,373 --> 00:49:28,543
No. Second?

1342
00:49:28,543 --> 00:49:30,143
We'll go second.

1343
00:49:30,143 --> 00:49:31,673
- Are you going to get them? - Yes.

1344
00:49:31,673 --> 00:49:34,013
- You can go after. - Right.

1345
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:35,083
All right.

1346
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:36,713
- Stand in order. - Go in order.

1347
00:49:36,713 --> 00:49:38,353
We'll go second.

1348
00:49:38,353 --> 00:49:40,553
- I'll go third. - You have to go in order.

1349
00:49:40,553 --> 00:49:42,083
- You can't go multiple times. - All right.

1350
00:49:42,523 --> 00:49:47,893
(How many radishes will Team Wook Min pull out?)

1351
00:49:47,893 --> 00:49:50,423
(Try if you dare.)

1352
00:49:51,193 --> 00:49:52,463
Let's do this.

1353
00:49:52,763 --> 00:49:54,133
- Ready. - Let's do this.

1354
00:49:54,133 --> 00:49:55,263
Let's do this!

1355
00:49:55,263 --> 00:49:56,263
We can do it!

1356
00:49:56,263 --> 00:49:58,833
- All right. - We can do it.

1357
00:49:59,033 --> 00:50:00,603
- Ready. - Let's resist.

1358
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:04,613
(Pull Out the Radishes...)

1359
00:50:04,613 --> 00:50:06,273
(starts now.)

1360
00:50:06,273 --> 00:50:07,313
(Ji Hyo and So Min attack first.)

1361
00:50:07,313 --> 00:50:10,343
Go after Na Eun. We're in trouble.

1362
00:50:10,583 --> 00:50:12,053
Tickle her.

1363
00:50:12,053 --> 00:50:13,883
- Resist. - Tickle her.

1364
00:50:14,223 --> 00:50:16,083
No, resist. Resist, Na Eun.

1365
00:50:16,083 --> 00:50:17,393
(She yanks at Na Eun's hair.)

1366
00:50:18,853 --> 00:50:20,153
Don't pull her hair.

1367
00:50:20,153 --> 00:50:22,063
- She's pulling my hair. - You can't do that.

1368
00:50:22,063 --> 00:50:23,393
You can't pull her hair.

1369
00:50:23,563 --> 00:50:26,163
- Take her out. - They're moving right. Move right.

1370
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,533
Move right. Good.

1371
00:50:27,533 --> 00:50:29,333
- Stick together. - You can't bite!

1372
00:50:29,333 --> 00:50:30,503
You can't bite.

1373
00:50:30,503 --> 00:50:31,673
Don't bite, So Min.

1374
00:50:33,173 --> 00:50:36,243
We're in trouble. Can't you go for Na Eun's arms?

1375
00:50:36,243 --> 00:50:37,673
- We got it. - You got it?

1376
00:50:37,673 --> 00:50:39,243
- Get her arms. - Resist.

1377
00:50:39,243 --> 00:50:40,913
Resist. Move to the right more.

1378
00:50:41,113 --> 00:50:42,683
I did it.

1379
00:50:42,683 --> 00:50:45,813
- We did it. - We got it.

1380
00:50:46,413 --> 00:50:47,783
Move right.

1381
00:50:47,783 --> 00:50:49,683
(The ace member, Ji Hyo, shakes up the defense.)

1382
00:50:49,683 --> 00:50:51,693
All right.

1383
00:50:51,693 --> 00:50:53,493
No! No!

1384
00:50:53,623 --> 00:50:55,463
Let go. No!

1385
00:50:55,893 --> 00:50:57,863
(Na Eun's foot touches the outside of the mat.)

1386
00:50:57,863 --> 00:50:59,033
- She's out. - She's out.

1387
00:50:59,563 --> 00:51:00,763
Na Eun is out.

1388
00:51:00,763 --> 00:51:02,703
- Na Eun is out. - That was a good one.

1389
00:51:02,703 --> 00:51:03,803
Na Eun is done.

1390
00:51:03,803 --> 00:51:05,173
Next.

1391
00:51:05,173 --> 00:51:07,103
Na Eun is done.

1392
00:51:07,103 --> 00:51:08,703
(Haha and Sung Moon are next.)

1393
00:51:08,703 --> 00:51:09,873
Resist.

1394
00:51:10,343 --> 00:51:12,013
Keep going.

1395
00:51:12,143 --> 00:51:13,313
Good job.

1396
00:51:13,843 --> 00:51:16,783
- It has to touch the ground. - Touch it on the ground.

1397
00:51:17,513 --> 00:51:19,753
(Haha suppresses Jong Myung...)

1398
00:51:19,753 --> 00:51:21,983
(while Sung Moon touches his foot on the ground.)

1399
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,353
- We did it. - You're out.

1400
00:51:23,353 --> 00:51:24,693
Jong Myung is out.

1401
00:51:24,793 --> 00:51:26,193
Okay.

1402
00:51:26,693 --> 00:51:29,193
Jae Seok!

1403
00:51:29,193 --> 00:51:30,763
(Hold on tightly, Sae Ho.)

1404
00:51:32,263 --> 00:51:34,503
(Sae Ho lets go.)

1405
00:51:34,503 --> 00:51:38,833
(You should get rid of radishes that are not worth the time.)

1406
00:51:40,943 --> 00:51:44,213
(Dragging)

1407
00:51:44,513 --> 00:51:47,713
(Is this the end?)

1408
00:51:47,713 --> 00:51:52,483
(We'll try to survive.)

1409
00:51:54,383 --> 00:51:57,423
(Jae Seok is not helpful. He's out.)

1410
00:51:57,423 --> 00:51:58,653
Jae Seok is out.

1411
00:51:59,553 --> 00:52:04,163
(Wook Min and Geun Sik are in charge of the heavy radishes.)

1412
00:52:04,893 --> 00:52:06,563
Go for him.

1413
00:52:07,263 --> 00:52:08,303
Good job.

1414
00:52:08,303 --> 00:52:09,733
Hold him.

1415
00:52:09,733 --> 00:52:11,273
- Good one. - Drag him.

1416
00:52:11,273 --> 00:52:13,333
(They pull together,)

1417
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:15,843
(and the other team is being dragged.)

1418
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:18,543
(That's so cool.)

1419
00:52:18,743 --> 00:52:20,713
Do it all together.

1420
00:52:20,713 --> 00:52:22,143
- Touch his head. - Touch his head on the floor.

1421
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,383
- Come out. - Let go.

1422
00:52:23,383 --> 00:52:24,513
Let go!

1423
00:52:24,513 --> 00:52:26,183
- Let go. - In 1, 2, 3.

1424
00:52:26,953 --> 00:52:29,053
Let me go! Let me go!

1425
00:52:29,283 --> 00:52:30,483
Let go!

1426
00:52:30,923 --> 00:52:32,823
I said to let go!

1427
00:52:33,093 --> 00:52:34,123
(Jong Kook resists desperately,)

1428
00:52:34,793 --> 00:52:36,793
(but his foot touches the ground.)

1429
00:52:36,793 --> 00:52:38,663
- He's done. - Jong Kook is out.

1430
00:52:38,663 --> 00:52:40,563
Jong Kook is out.

1431
00:52:40,563 --> 00:52:42,133
You can't do that.

1432
00:52:42,133 --> 00:52:43,663
Did you throw me out?

1433
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:45,633
You're trash.

1434
00:52:45,633 --> 00:52:46,873
- No. - Did you take him out?

1435
00:52:47,203 --> 00:52:48,373
Hurry.

1436
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,573
Pass.

1437
00:52:49,703 --> 00:52:52,043
- What should we do? - Pass.

1438
00:52:52,673 --> 00:52:53,773
Get Sae Ho.

1439
00:52:53,873 --> 00:52:55,183
Let go!

1440
00:52:55,183 --> 00:52:57,483
(Screaming)

1441
00:52:57,813 --> 00:53:00,683
(He makes animal-like sounds.)

1442
00:53:01,983 --> 00:53:03,223
(Ripping)

1443
00:53:03,223 --> 00:53:04,293
(They keep pulling.)

1444
00:53:04,293 --> 00:53:05,323
What's that?

1445
00:53:05,723 --> 00:53:07,463
(You can see his bare skin.)

1446
00:53:08,823 --> 00:53:12,093
(He unexpectedly exposes himself.)

1447
00:53:15,403 --> 00:53:16,933
(He's in tatters.)

1448
00:53:21,373 --> 00:53:24,173
(Yelling)

1449
00:53:24,173 --> 00:53:26,073
(He lets out a naked and painful cry.)

1450
00:53:26,073 --> 00:53:29,343
(Summer is the season for off-shoulder tops.)

1451
00:53:30,853 --> 00:53:32,483
Tickle Kwang Soo.

1452
00:53:34,083 --> 00:53:35,783
(He holds onto Hang Ho.)

1453
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:39,023
They're so strong.

1454
00:53:40,093 --> 00:53:41,863
(There's 1 minute left.)

1455
00:53:41,863 --> 00:53:43,463
Kwang Soo!

1456
00:53:44,733 --> 00:53:46,293
Stick together.

1457
00:53:46,293 --> 00:53:48,533
Kwang Soo, don't squish my right foot.

1458
00:53:48,803 --> 00:53:51,173
That hurts!

1459
00:53:51,173 --> 00:53:53,273
Kwang Soo.

1460
00:53:53,273 --> 00:53:55,343
- I'm sorry. - Don't squish my right foot.

1461
00:53:55,343 --> 00:53:56,873
Kwang Soo, stop.

1462
00:53:57,103 --> 00:53:59,043
Free my right foot.

1463
00:53:59,043 --> 00:54:00,173
No.

1464
00:54:00,173 --> 00:54:01,343
You can't.

1465
00:54:01,343 --> 00:54:03,443
Don't do it.

1466
00:54:04,053 --> 00:54:05,113
We're in trouble.

1467
00:54:05,113 --> 00:54:07,013
- Take both out. - Take both of them out.

1468
00:54:07,013 --> 00:54:08,223
These two are going together.

1469
00:54:08,483 --> 00:54:09,853
- Kwang Soo. - Haha.

1470
00:54:09,853 --> 00:54:11,093
- Haha. - Who's this?

1471
00:54:12,193 --> 00:54:14,063
Get my arm.

1472
00:54:14,063 --> 00:54:17,663
(Kwang Soo's back gets exposed.)

1473
00:54:17,863 --> 00:54:20,163
My wrist is getting squished, Kwang Soo.

1474
00:54:20,233 --> 00:54:21,603
(Ripping)

1475
00:54:22,533 --> 00:54:25,803
(Kwang Soo's underwear is revealed.)

1476
00:54:26,273 --> 00:54:27,973
Hey!

1477
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:31,543
(Kwang Soo is flashing rainbows on his back.)

1478
00:54:31,543 --> 00:54:35,513
(Say hello to Mother Nature.)

1479
00:54:36,913 --> 00:54:38,153
Let go.

1480
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:41,153
- Stop it. - Don't.

1481
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:43,653
- You can't! - Don't go, Kwang Soo.

1482
00:54:44,423 --> 00:54:46,193
Let me go!

1483
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:48,623
Let go!

1484
00:54:50,793 --> 00:54:52,963
(That's still not enough.)

1485
00:54:53,533 --> 00:54:55,363
- Go for his foot. - Try the foot.

1486
00:54:55,363 --> 00:54:56,833
- Take his foot out. - Come on, Kwang Soo.

1487
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:58,273
Take his leg out.

1488
00:54:58,273 --> 00:54:59,773
(They go for Sae Ho who's barely holding on.)

1489
00:55:01,903 --> 00:55:03,673
Let's go. In 1, 2...

1490
00:55:04,113 --> 00:55:06,043
- Touch his foot on the ground. - In 1, 2, 3.

1491
00:55:06,213 --> 00:55:07,813
That's good. Touch it on the floor.

1492
00:55:08,143 --> 00:55:11,013
His legs are too short. They don't reach.

1493
00:55:11,513 --> 00:55:12,753
His legs are too short.

1494
00:55:12,753 --> 00:55:13,753
(It's almost touching the floor.)

1495
00:55:16,853 --> 00:55:17,993
10 seconds left.

1496
00:55:17,993 --> 00:55:20,553
We're almost there. You can do this.

1497
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:21,823
You can do this!

1498
00:55:22,363 --> 00:55:25,733
8, 7, 6,

1499
00:55:25,733 --> 00:55:27,503
- 5, 4, - 5, 4,

1500
00:55:27,603 --> 00:55:30,333
- 3, 2, 1. - 3, 2, 1.

1501
00:55:30,403 --> 00:55:32,273
- Okay. - Time is up.

1502
00:55:32,273 --> 00:55:37,073
(Team Jong Kook defends successfully.)

1503
00:55:37,073 --> 00:55:38,413
Kwang Soo.

1504
00:55:38,413 --> 00:55:39,843
(They're completely exhausted.)

1505
00:55:42,413 --> 00:55:43,643
My ear hurts.

1506
00:55:43,813 --> 00:55:46,483
How far did you pull up my underwear?

1507
00:55:47,013 --> 00:55:48,553
- What have you done? - What happened?

1508
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,693
Someone performed a colonoscopy on me.

1509
00:55:51,123 --> 00:55:54,093
My underwear almost went through my throat.

1510
00:55:54,763 --> 00:55:56,493
Good job, Kwang Soo.

1511
00:55:56,993 --> 00:55:58,733
That was great.

1512
00:55:58,733 --> 00:56:00,563
- Thank you. - Good job.

1513
00:56:00,633 --> 00:56:01,833
You did well.

1514
00:56:01,933 --> 00:56:02,933
Whose is this?

1515
00:56:03,163 --> 00:56:05,403
Most things will be mine.

1516
00:56:06,403 --> 00:56:07,443
Great job.

1517
00:56:07,743 --> 00:56:10,773
(His pants fall off.)

1518
00:56:11,873 --> 00:56:15,443
(He shows his underwear.)

1519
00:56:15,443 --> 00:56:19,513
(His pants fall off easily with the smallest movement.)

1520
00:56:19,513 --> 00:56:21,623
What are you doing?

1521
00:56:21,623 --> 00:56:22,623
Kwang Soo.

1522
00:56:23,483 --> 00:56:24,493
What are you doing?

1523
00:56:25,523 --> 00:56:26,953
What's wrong with you?

1524
00:56:26,993 --> 00:56:28,163
- I'm sorry. - Na Eun is here.

1525
00:56:28,163 --> 00:56:30,163
- What are you doing? - I'm sorry.

1526
00:56:30,163 --> 00:56:32,433
- Why did my pants get so loose? - I'm sorry, Na Eun.

1527
00:56:32,433 --> 00:56:34,063
Why did my pants get so loose?

1528
00:56:34,063 --> 00:56:35,833
I'm sorry that you saw that, Na Eun.

1529
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:36,933
What happened to my pants?

1530
00:56:37,533 --> 00:56:38,533
Kwang Soo.

1531
00:56:38,533 --> 00:56:40,503
- What on earth happened? - Goodness.

1532
00:56:40,533 --> 00:56:41,543
What happened?

1533
00:56:41,543 --> 00:56:44,043
I was standing still, but why did they fall off?

1534
00:56:44,173 --> 00:56:47,243
(4 members get pulled out, and 4 members survive.)

1535
00:56:48,183 --> 00:56:49,443
Let's switch places.

1536
00:56:49,443 --> 00:56:50,443
(They switch positions.)

1537
00:56:50,443 --> 00:56:52,753
- Get ready. Let's go. - We can do it.

1538
00:56:52,753 --> 00:56:55,023
Let's do a cheer in 1, 2, 3.

1539
00:56:55,023 --> 00:56:56,023
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1540
00:56:56,023 --> 00:57:01,523
(Will Team Jong Kook take out more members?)

1541
00:57:04,763 --> 00:57:06,393
- Get ready. - I'm angry.

1542
00:57:06,433 --> 00:57:07,433
Set.

1543
00:57:07,433 --> 00:57:09,763
(The team competition starts.)

1544
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:12,033
(Se Chan and Na Eun start the attack.)

1545
00:57:12,503 --> 00:57:14,643
- She's out if she's off the mat. - No.

1546
00:57:15,143 --> 00:57:17,273
(So Min's foot touches the floor.)

1547
00:57:17,273 --> 00:57:18,913
- She's out. - So Min is out.

1548
00:57:19,073 --> 00:57:20,643
(Jae Seok and Sae Ho are up next.)

1549
00:57:20,643 --> 00:57:22,243
Okay, pull now.

1550
00:57:22,243 --> 00:57:23,713
Come on.

1551
00:57:24,183 --> 00:57:25,713
- He's out. - Seok Jin is out.

1552
00:57:25,983 --> 00:57:27,753
- Seok Jin is out. - He's out.

1553
00:57:27,753 --> 00:57:29,953
- Get closer. - It's this side.

1554
00:57:29,953 --> 00:57:31,693
- It's this side. - Come here.

1555
00:57:31,693 --> 00:57:32,953
Come here now.

1556
00:57:33,623 --> 00:57:35,323
- One. - Don't let go.

1557
00:57:35,323 --> 00:57:37,633
- You can do it. - You can do it.

1558
00:57:37,633 --> 00:57:38,833
Did you separate them?

1559
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:40,763
- Kwang Soo, pull now. - Pull now.

1560
00:57:40,763 --> 00:57:41,933
- Pull. - Pull.

1561
00:57:42,003 --> 00:57:45,233
(At that moment, Jong Myung lowers himself.)

1562
00:57:45,233 --> 00:57:48,703
(He grabs Wook Min's leg.)

1563
00:57:50,973 --> 00:57:52,243
You got it.

1564
00:57:52,243 --> 00:57:53,513
Come on.

1565
00:57:53,713 --> 00:57:56,413
(He puts down his foot on the floor.)

1566
00:57:56,413 --> 00:57:57,453
He's out.

1567
00:57:57,453 --> 00:57:59,883
(Jong Myung grabs Wook Min's muscular leg.)

1568
00:57:59,883 --> 00:58:01,853
- He did it. - Wook Min is out.

1569
00:58:02,023 --> 00:58:03,683
Wook Min is out.

1570
00:58:03,683 --> 00:58:05,053
Who's up next?

1571
00:58:05,053 --> 00:58:06,123
Is it us?

1572
00:58:06,123 --> 00:58:07,493
- Yes. - Is it our turn?

1573
00:58:07,493 --> 00:58:09,063
(Jong Kook and Hang Ho enter.)

1574
00:58:09,063 --> 00:58:10,323
(The real game starts.)

1575
00:58:10,323 --> 00:58:11,493
Get closer.

1576
00:58:11,493 --> 00:58:13,263
- Get closer. - Get on top of him.

1577
00:58:14,103 --> 00:58:15,863
- Is it our turn? - Get closer.

1578
00:58:17,333 --> 00:58:19,903
(Today is the day...)

1579
00:58:19,903 --> 00:58:22,943
(the radish field gets destroyed.)

1580
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:25,601
(Soo Yong is the first victim.)

1581
00:58:25,601 --> 00:58:26,601
- What's going on? - No.

1582
00:58:26,601 --> 00:58:29,141
(Soo Yong is the first victim.)

1583
00:58:29,141 --> 00:58:30,441
(Soo Yong is eliminated instantly.)

1584
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:37,112
(He can only resist once and scream 3 times.)

1585
00:58:37,112 --> 00:58:39,452
He's out. We're up next.

1586
00:58:39,452 --> 00:58:41,082
- We're up next. - Who is it?

1587
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:43,122
- Come on. - What are you doing?

1588
00:58:43,122 --> 00:58:44,252
(Only 1 minute remains.)

1589
00:58:44,252 --> 00:58:46,052
Geun Sik, you're strong.

1590
00:58:46,052 --> 00:58:49,322
He's so strong. He's pulling everyone.

1591
00:58:49,322 --> 00:58:52,332
(Geun Sik grabs onto all the members.)

1592
00:58:52,332 --> 00:58:53,632
He's so strong.

1593
00:58:53,632 --> 00:58:54,992
Pass your turn if you can't do it.

1594
00:58:55,262 --> 00:58:56,532
- Pass your turn if you can't. - Pass it.

1595
00:58:56,532 --> 00:58:58,002
- It may be possible. - Pass.

1596
00:58:58,002 --> 00:58:59,972
- We're next. - Hurry up.

1597
00:58:59,972 --> 00:59:00,972
Pull them up.

1598
00:59:00,972 --> 00:59:02,802
Grab someone in the middle.

1599
00:59:02,802 --> 00:59:03,802
Go.

1600
00:59:04,002 --> 00:59:05,612
Come on.

1601
00:59:06,212 --> 00:59:08,642
Be careful of the foot.

1602
00:59:09,242 --> 00:59:10,242
What happened?

1603
00:59:11,042 --> 00:59:12,052
Be careful of the foot.

1604
00:59:12,052 --> 00:59:13,852
(It's a brutal attack.)

1605
00:59:13,852 --> 00:59:14,852
(He throws a fit.)

1606
00:59:14,852 --> 00:59:16,252
What happened?

1607
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:18,052
- What's wrong? - My foot.

1608
00:59:18,052 --> 00:59:20,052
- Hurry up. - Come and pull now.

1609
00:59:20,122 --> 00:59:21,962
- Are you okay, Sae Ho? - Hurry up.

1610
00:59:21,962 --> 00:59:23,222
Are you okay, Sae Ho?

1611
00:59:23,222 --> 00:59:24,822
Come on, you can do it.

1612
00:59:24,822 --> 00:59:26,432
(It's a strenuous task.)

1613
00:59:26,432 --> 00:59:27,992
- Bite him. - You're doing well.

1614
00:59:27,992 --> 00:59:29,632
Ji Hyo is almost out.

1615
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:31,402
- Ji Hyo is out. - Ji Hyo is out.

1616
00:59:31,532 --> 00:59:32,932
- Okay. - It's our turn.

1617
00:59:32,932 --> 00:59:34,332
- It's our turn. - Come this way.

1618
00:59:34,332 --> 00:59:37,702
- It's our turn, Jong Myung. - Hurry up.

1619
00:59:37,702 --> 00:59:39,242
(He calls for Jong Myung.)

1620
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,072
- Wait. - Hurry up.

1621
00:59:41,072 --> 00:59:42,082
(He speaks impolitely as he's in a hurry.)

1622
00:59:42,082 --> 00:59:43,412
Jong Myung.

1623
00:59:43,742 --> 00:59:45,612
In 1, 2.

1624
00:59:45,752 --> 00:59:47,082
- Three. - Come on.

1625
00:59:47,082 --> 00:59:48,552
Sung Moon is out.

1626
00:59:49,182 --> 00:59:50,852
- Okay. - It's Jong Kook.

1627
00:59:50,852 --> 00:59:52,222
(Screaming)

1628
00:59:53,592 --> 00:59:55,522
(Let's go home, Geun Sik.)

1629
00:59:56,422 --> 00:59:57,522
(Sung Moon and Geun Sik are out.)

1630
00:59:57,522 --> 00:59:58,992
- Who's next? - It's me.

1631
00:59:58,992 --> 01:00:00,162
Here I come.

1632
01:00:00,432 --> 01:00:01,862
My goodness.

1633
01:00:04,432 --> 01:00:06,932
That was excellent.

1634
01:00:06,932 --> 01:00:08,902
We were at a disadvantage.

1635
01:00:08,902 --> 01:00:10,472
We work well as a team.

1636
01:00:10,472 --> 01:00:12,072
I completely agree.

1637
01:00:12,072 --> 01:00:13,342
It was great.

1638
01:00:13,342 --> 01:00:14,872
I'm not joking.

1639
01:00:15,142 --> 01:00:17,782
Geun Sik hasn't won once.

1640
01:00:18,482 --> 01:00:19,582
Not even once.

1641
01:00:19,852 --> 01:00:20,852
That's true.

1642
01:00:20,852 --> 01:00:22,952
He didn't win during Yu Jae Seok's Game.

1643
01:00:23,752 --> 01:00:24,952
Poor Geun Sik.

1644
01:00:24,952 --> 01:00:26,422
"What do you want to eat the most?"

1645
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:27,552
He answered, "Grapes".

1646
01:00:28,022 --> 01:00:29,122
Goodness.

1647
01:00:29,322 --> 01:00:30,462
He wanted grapes.

1648
01:00:30,462 --> 01:00:32,092
- What should he do? - He wanted some grapes.

1649
01:00:32,732 --> 01:00:34,232
(It's Round 2.)

1650
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:38,262
- What? - That's how to do it.

1651
01:00:39,232 --> 01:00:41,402
- This is a good strategy. - Should I lie the other way?

1652
01:00:41,532 --> 01:00:44,042
- That's a new strategy. - Look at that.

1653
01:00:44,042 --> 01:00:46,712
- Like this? - That's a good idea.

1654
01:00:46,942 --> 01:00:48,642
That's a good position.

1655
01:00:49,742 --> 01:00:52,082
Na Eun and Jong Kook will start.

1656
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:53,252
Let's go, Jong Kook.

1657
01:00:53,452 --> 01:00:54,712
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1658
01:00:54,712 --> 01:00:55,722
Come in.

1659
01:00:55,722 --> 01:00:57,682
(Na Eun and Jong Kook start.)

1660
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:01,192
- Get ready, set. - You can do it.

1661
01:01:02,722 --> 01:01:03,722
Okay.

1662
01:01:04,892 --> 01:01:06,732
(They separate Soo Yong first.)

1663
01:01:06,732 --> 01:01:08,092
They're moving everyone.

1664
01:01:08,092 --> 01:01:10,132
Resist with your legs.

1665
01:01:10,802 --> 01:01:11,832
Resist.

1666
01:01:11,832 --> 01:01:13,602
(The whole group is being pulled.)

1667
01:01:15,132 --> 01:01:16,742
(He grabs Soo Yong's pants.)

1668
01:01:16,742 --> 01:01:18,812
(He pulls with all his might.)

1669
01:01:20,372 --> 01:01:21,372
(Pulling)

1670
01:01:21,372 --> 01:01:22,382
That won't work.

1671
01:01:24,242 --> 01:01:25,452
(He's in tatters.)

1672
01:01:29,582 --> 01:01:31,752
- Wait, Soo Yong's pants got torn. - You're doing well.

1673
01:01:31,782 --> 01:01:33,392
(Shocked)

1674
01:01:34,422 --> 01:01:36,122
- His pants got torn. - They're his pants.

1675
01:01:36,122 --> 01:01:37,762
His pants really got torn.

1676
01:01:38,122 --> 01:01:40,532
- They're his pants. - Why?

1677
01:01:40,532 --> 01:01:42,262
Jong Kook tore them.

1678
01:01:42,262 --> 01:01:43,932
- No. - He's out.

1679
01:01:44,432 --> 01:01:45,532
Soo Yong is out.

1680
01:01:45,532 --> 01:01:47,372
Turn toward this way.

1681
01:01:47,372 --> 01:01:49,702
Pull them by the leg.

1682
01:01:49,702 --> 01:01:50,842
Grab the leg.

1683
01:01:50,902 --> 01:01:52,612
Let's pull.

1684
01:01:52,612 --> 01:01:55,072
1, 2, 1, 2.

1685
01:01:55,072 --> 01:01:56,982
- 1, 2. - Wait.

1686
01:01:57,082 --> 01:01:58,952
- Hold on a minute. - He's out.

1687
01:01:58,952 --> 01:02:01,252
- He's out. - He's out.

1688
01:02:01,252 --> 01:02:02,982
- Jong Kook is up next. - Na Eun.

1689
01:02:02,982 --> 01:02:04,022
Come on, Na Eun.

1690
01:02:04,222 --> 01:02:06,322
- Let's pull them up. - Keep yourself wrapped.

1691
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:08,722
- Pull him up. - Move out of the way.

1692
01:02:08,722 --> 01:02:09,792
(Geun Sik the Radish is pulled again.)

1693
01:02:10,792 --> 01:02:13,032
(His strength is always surprising.)

1694
01:02:13,032 --> 01:02:14,232
Move out of the way.

1695
01:02:14,462 --> 01:02:17,262
(Geun Sik and Ji Hyo are about to be eliminated.)

1696
01:02:17,262 --> 01:02:19,932
(They'll be eliminated at the same time.)

1697
01:02:21,432 --> 01:02:23,442
(She separates before being eliminated.)

1698
01:02:24,902 --> 01:02:26,712
- Who's next? Go. - Hold on.

1699
01:02:26,942 --> 01:02:28,212
It's Kwang Soo.

1700
01:02:28,442 --> 01:02:29,442
Pull Ji Hyo out.

1701
01:02:29,442 --> 01:02:31,042
(It's good to see you, Kwang Soo.)

1702
01:02:31,712 --> 01:02:32,752
Come on.

1703
01:02:33,752 --> 01:02:36,352
(This is today's main competition.)

1704
01:02:38,822 --> 01:02:41,422
(They use fancy techniques.)

1705
01:02:43,592 --> 01:02:46,192
(It's entertaining for the audience.)

1706
01:02:48,262 --> 01:02:49,362
Hey.

1707
01:02:49,362 --> 01:02:50,362
Stop it.

1708
01:02:50,362 --> 01:02:52,032
(She gives him a special massage.)

1709
01:02:52,332 --> 01:02:53,732
Get out.

1710
01:02:53,802 --> 01:02:55,802
(He expresses pleasure with his whole body.)

1711
01:02:57,802 --> 01:03:00,342
(He pushes Ji Hyo out with all his strength.)

1712
01:03:01,472 --> 01:03:02,482
She's out.

1713
01:03:02,482 --> 01:03:04,742
(Will she be eliminated...)

1714
01:03:04,742 --> 01:03:06,312
(by Kwang Soo?)

1715
01:03:06,312 --> 01:03:09,182
No, she's not out yet.

1716
01:03:09,182 --> 01:03:11,822
(Ji Hyo is Wonder Woman.)

1717
01:03:11,822 --> 01:03:14,522
Ji Hyo is impressive.

1718
01:03:14,522 --> 01:03:16,462
(She overcomes the biggest risk.)

1719
01:03:17,192 --> 01:03:19,332
Hurry up and help me.

1720
01:03:19,332 --> 01:03:20,362
Hang Ho.

1721
01:03:20,792 --> 01:03:22,332
Eliminate Ji Hyo now.

1722
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:23,962
Hurry.

1723
01:03:23,962 --> 01:03:26,172
(Hang Ho carefully attacks Ji Hyo from behind.)

1724
01:03:28,132 --> 01:03:29,142
Come on.

1725
01:03:29,202 --> 01:03:32,212
(Come with me if you don't want to be bald.)

1726
01:03:33,472 --> 01:03:35,212
She's out.

1727
01:03:35,212 --> 01:03:37,142
(Ji Hyo is finally out.)

1728
01:03:37,282 --> 01:03:38,312
Goodness.

1729
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:43,082
(Why did you pull out my neck?)

1730
01:03:43,082 --> 01:03:45,452
(Kwang Soo, life is a game.)

1731
01:03:45,452 --> 01:03:46,692
I feel like we won.

1732
01:03:46,692 --> 01:03:48,122
- You won. - Good job, Ji Hyo.

1733
01:03:48,352 --> 01:03:49,692
- You were impressive. - Good job.

1734
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:51,222
- I feel like we won. - You were impressive.

1735
01:03:51,222 --> 01:03:52,932
- We won. - You won.

1736
01:03:52,932 --> 01:03:55,232
You led your team to victory.

1737
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:56,362
That was impressive.

1738
01:03:56,602 --> 01:03:59,302
Your record is 2 minutes and 2 seconds.

1739
01:04:01,372 --> 01:04:03,202
(Team Jong Kook prepares their defense.)

1740
01:04:03,202 --> 01:04:05,042
I'm in pain from top to bottom.

1741
01:04:07,812 --> 01:04:10,142
(He feels the aftereffects on his scalp and bottom.)

1742
01:04:12,012 --> 01:04:14,052
(What is this?)

1743
01:04:16,622 --> 01:04:17,622
What's wrong?

1744
01:04:17,622 --> 01:04:19,452
I think I'm bleeding.

1745
01:04:20,122 --> 01:04:21,792
- It's okay. - You're okay.

1746
01:04:21,792 --> 01:04:23,522
Besides, Jong Myung is a doctor.

1747
01:04:23,522 --> 01:04:24,692
You'll be okay.

1748
01:04:24,692 --> 01:04:26,362
- Isn't he a plastic surgeon? - Right.

1749
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,232
- He's still a doctor. - Of course.

1750
01:04:28,232 --> 01:04:29,602
A plastic surgeon can do it too.

1751
01:04:29,602 --> 01:04:31,332
He's great at stitching up wounds.

1752
01:04:31,532 --> 01:04:32,732
Can he sew this up too?

1753
01:04:32,732 --> 01:04:35,742
(Can he sew this up too?)

1754
01:04:37,042 --> 01:04:39,642
(My jeans are torn.)

1755
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:41,472
The jeans are his own.

1756
01:04:41,472 --> 01:04:43,182
(He has no stylists.)

1757
01:04:43,182 --> 01:04:45,252
- He has no stylists. - Are you okay?

1758
01:04:45,682 --> 01:04:47,512
He has to go home that way.

1759
01:04:47,512 --> 01:04:49,252
(He has to go home grabbing onto his jeans.)

1760
01:04:51,652 --> 01:04:52,822
Look at his belt.

1761
01:04:53,052 --> 01:04:54,322
His belt is torn too.

1762
01:04:55,052 --> 01:04:57,092
Jong Kook!

1763
01:04:57,092 --> 01:04:58,862
He has no stylists.

1764
01:04:58,862 --> 01:05:00,092
They're his personal belongings.

1765
01:05:00,092 --> 01:05:02,262
He has to sew it up himself.

1766
01:05:02,962 --> 01:05:04,632
Even his belt got torn.

1767
01:05:04,632 --> 01:05:06,772
Jeans like these are in fashion these days.

1768
01:05:06,832 --> 01:05:08,302
It's in fashion.

1769
01:05:08,302 --> 01:05:09,702
I was just going to tear them anyway.

1770
01:05:09,702 --> 01:05:12,372
(Nonchalant)

1771
01:05:12,372 --> 01:05:13,912
He's so generous.

1772
01:05:14,012 --> 01:05:15,312
- Thank you. - He's so generous.

1773
01:05:15,712 --> 01:05:18,082
- Thank you. - It's in fashion now.

1774
01:05:18,212 --> 01:05:19,412
I was going to tear them.

1775
01:05:19,412 --> 01:05:20,482
(Soo Yong is a fashion leader.)

1776
01:05:20,482 --> 01:05:21,882
It's in fashion.

1777
01:05:23,382 --> 01:05:24,982
- Put these on. - Put these on.

1778
01:05:24,982 --> 01:05:26,292
(He changes into work pants.)

1779
01:05:26,292 --> 01:05:27,822
Change into those behind the folding screen.

1780
01:05:27,822 --> 01:05:29,022
- Do that. - That'd be better.

1781
01:05:29,022 --> 01:05:30,162
(Go change.)

1782
01:05:31,722 --> 01:05:34,532
Wait, don't go in there.

1783
01:05:34,532 --> 01:05:36,432
(Don't go behind the folding screen.)

1784
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,002
- Don't go there. - It's okay.

1785
01:05:38,462 --> 01:05:40,172
Don't go behind the folding screen.

1786
01:05:40,172 --> 01:05:41,172
No!

1787
01:05:41,572 --> 01:05:42,602
Don't go there, Soo Yong!

1788
01:05:42,602 --> 01:05:45,242
(Soo Yong was such a nice friend.)

1789
01:05:45,242 --> 01:05:47,012
(Most of all, he was a fashion leader.)

1790
01:05:47,012 --> 01:05:48,072
Say goodbye to him.

1791
01:05:51,312 --> 01:05:54,012
(Eye-catching)

1792
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:58,452
(Any pants look great on him.)

1793
01:06:00,452 --> 01:06:02,562
Soo Yong.

1794
01:06:02,562 --> 01:06:03,992
Take your jeans.

1795
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:06,262
(Don't forget your limited-edition jeans.)

1796
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:08,192
Don't throw them away here.

1797
01:06:08,732 --> 01:06:10,832
Shouldn't you wear those over the jeans?

1798
01:06:10,832 --> 01:06:12,502
It's better this way.

1799
01:06:12,502 --> 01:06:13,572
(Soo Yong has become fashionable.)

1800
01:06:14,432 --> 01:06:15,802
All right.

1801
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:18,402
Team White won the game.

1802
01:06:18,772 --> 01:06:20,172
You'll get...

1803
01:06:20,172 --> 01:06:21,442
(Team Jong Kook wins 20 dollars.)

1804
01:06:21,442 --> 01:06:22,912
I feel bad.

1805
01:06:23,012 --> 01:06:24,482
Where should we keep the money?

1806
01:06:24,482 --> 01:06:25,512
Everyone gets five dollars.

1807
01:06:25,512 --> 01:06:27,712
Hey, you gave me only four dollars.

1808
01:06:27,712 --> 01:06:29,382
(Are you tricking me again?)

1809
01:06:31,022 --> 01:06:32,992
- You can have it all. - Why?

1810
01:06:32,992 --> 01:06:35,092
You worked so hard. You can have it all.

1811
01:06:35,092 --> 01:06:36,822
(We won thanks to you.)

1812
01:06:36,822 --> 01:06:37,822
Take it all.

1813
01:06:38,192 --> 01:06:42,462
(Se Chan and Na Eun have 53 dollars.)

1814
01:06:42,562 --> 01:06:44,832
Everyone, as I said earlier,

1815
01:06:45,332 --> 01:06:49,302
the four teams that just won...

1816
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:54,542
can choose to change their partners.

1817
01:06:54,612 --> 01:06:56,342
Let me know quietly.

1818
01:06:56,342 --> 01:06:57,412
Come closer.

1819
01:06:58,012 --> 01:07:00,482
We can change our partners.

1820
01:07:00,852 --> 01:07:03,022
We won 20 dollars. We don't have to change partners.

1821
01:07:03,022 --> 01:07:05,252
(Their decisions will change the situation of mission fees.)

1822
01:07:05,892 --> 01:07:08,152
Jong Myung, please come here.

1823
01:07:08,152 --> 01:07:09,362
(Jong Myung makes a decision first.)

1824
01:07:11,122 --> 01:07:14,132
We come from a family with tradition.

1825
01:07:14,132 --> 01:07:17,732
(Will he take his family tradition into account?)

1826
01:07:17,732 --> 01:07:20,402
(He makes a decision without hesitation.)

1827
01:07:20,402 --> 01:07:21,872
Please go back to your position.

1828
01:07:23,302 --> 01:07:25,272
Na Eun.

1829
01:07:25,272 --> 01:07:26,442
(It's Na Eun's turn.)

1830
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:27,772
I'm curious what she will choose.

1831
01:07:28,272 --> 01:07:29,542
She might surprise us.

1832
01:07:30,142 --> 01:07:32,152
What will Se Chan do if she wants to change her partner?

1833
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:35,552
I was happy today.

1834
01:07:36,322 --> 01:07:39,152
(Na Eun has made a decision.)

1835
01:07:39,652 --> 01:07:43,892
(Everyone has made a decision.)

1836
01:07:46,632 --> 01:07:47,832
Jong Myung...

1837
01:07:47,832 --> 01:07:50,232
(Did he choose a rich partner...)

1838
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:52,572
(or his little brother?)

1839
01:07:52,572 --> 01:07:54,472
(Who did he choose?)

1840
01:07:54,472 --> 01:07:57,142
Jong Myung does not want to change his partner.

1841
01:07:57,142 --> 01:07:59,972
(Little brother, you're all I have.)

1842
01:08:00,912 --> 01:08:03,612
- That's beautiful. - My brother is smart.

1843
01:08:03,982 --> 01:08:07,282
Give your brother a hug, Jong Kook.

1844
01:08:07,282 --> 01:08:09,282
(A beautiful decision has been made.)

1845
01:08:09,282 --> 01:08:10,382
That's beautiful.

1846
01:08:11,482 --> 01:08:12,752
Na Eun...

1847
01:08:12,752 --> 01:08:13,892
(Na Eun has made a choice.)

1848
01:08:13,892 --> 01:08:15,022
Se Chan...

1849
01:08:15,022 --> 01:08:19,432
(Se Chan is waiting to hear her decision.)

1850
01:08:20,032 --> 01:08:23,162
(They made beautiful memories together.)

1851
01:08:23,162 --> 01:08:26,502
(Se Chan has been so kind to Na Eun.)

1852
01:08:27,132 --> 01:08:31,102
(We shared happiness together.)

1853
01:08:32,112 --> 01:08:35,912
(You share the same feelings with me, right?)

1854
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:36,912
Na Eun does not want to change her partner.

1855
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:38,342
(Na Eun does not want to change her partner.)

1856
01:08:38,512 --> 01:08:40,152
(I'll be with you.)

1857
01:08:40,152 --> 01:08:42,622
- Na Eun is loyal. - Se Chan is so kind to her.

1858
01:08:42,622 --> 01:08:45,352
Se Chan will suffer for at least two months.

1859
01:08:47,252 --> 01:08:49,592
Na Eun.

1860
01:08:49,592 --> 01:08:53,192
(The share a shy handshake.)

1861
01:08:53,932 --> 01:08:55,602
- Sae Ho. - Yes.

1862
01:08:56,262 --> 01:08:58,502
- Your current partner is Jae Seok. - That's right.

1863
01:08:58,502 --> 01:09:01,802
(It's time to see if Sae Ho still wants to be with Jae Seok.)

1864
01:09:02,072 --> 01:09:03,672
I always wanted to be close with Jae Seok,

1865
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:06,142
but he never showed any response.

1866
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:09,412
(Jae Seok always felt a bit distant.)

1867
01:09:09,412 --> 01:09:12,812
(This is Sae Ho's chance to express his feelings.)

1868
01:09:12,812 --> 01:09:14,082
Sae Ho wants to change his partner.

1869
01:09:16,482 --> 01:09:19,552
(I'm going to find someone else.)

1870
01:09:19,552 --> 01:09:20,892
(I'll make a new family.)

1871
01:09:20,892 --> 01:09:22,392
(Speechless)

1872
01:09:22,762 --> 01:09:23,792
Yes.

1873
01:09:24,162 --> 01:09:25,862
You're a betrayer.

1874
01:09:25,862 --> 01:09:27,662
No, I'm not.

1875
01:09:27,662 --> 01:09:28,962
It's just my situation.

1876
01:09:28,962 --> 01:09:30,262
I have to change my plans.

1877
01:09:30,262 --> 01:09:31,602
(Success means more to me than Jae Seok.)

1878
01:09:31,802 --> 01:09:33,902
Hang Ho's current partner is Kwang Soo.

1879
01:09:33,902 --> 01:09:35,102
He has no reason to change his partner.

1880
01:09:35,342 --> 01:09:36,442
He wants to change his partner.

1881
01:09:36,442 --> 01:09:37,842
(You're wrong about that.)

1882
01:09:37,842 --> 01:09:40,412
(It can't be because of money.)

1883
01:09:40,412 --> 01:09:41,572
He has no reason to change his partner.

1884
01:09:41,712 --> 01:09:42,782
He wants to change his partner.

1885
01:09:42,782 --> 01:09:46,112
(They have different ideas.)

1886
01:09:47,552 --> 01:09:49,582
He wants to change his partner.

1887
01:09:49,982 --> 01:09:51,082
But...

1888
01:09:51,082 --> 01:09:53,522
(But)

1889
01:09:54,552 --> 01:09:56,122
Both Hang Ho and Sae Ho...

1890
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:57,962
want to change places with Na Eun.

1891
01:09:57,962 --> 01:09:59,362
(Both Hang Ho and Sae Ho want to change places with Na Eun.)

1892
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:00,362
What?

1893
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:02,002
(They want to be with Se Chan as he has the most money.)

1894
01:10:02,002 --> 01:10:03,532
It's because he has the most money.

1895
01:10:03,602 --> 01:10:06,072
- Actually... - I hope Hang Ho will win.

1896
01:10:06,872 --> 01:10:08,132
So...

1897
01:10:09,472 --> 01:10:11,472
We have so many different kinds of equipment today.

1898
01:10:11,472 --> 01:10:12,872
Oh, that one.

1899
01:10:13,672 --> 01:10:14,742
What's that?

1900
01:10:14,972 --> 01:10:16,812
We have so many different kinds of equipment today.

1901
01:10:16,812 --> 01:10:18,582
(It's an electric shock roulette.)

1902
01:10:18,782 --> 01:10:20,582
Na Eun should participate too.

1903
01:10:20,582 --> 01:10:22,582
Yes, that'd be fair.

1904
01:10:22,852 --> 01:10:25,082
- All right. Na Eun, - Gosh.

1905
01:10:25,892 --> 01:10:27,792
- Hang Ho, - I'm so scared.

1906
01:10:27,792 --> 01:10:29,592
and Sae Ho, put your finger in this.

1907
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:31,862
The one who gets an electric shock will be eliminated.

1908
01:10:31,862 --> 01:10:33,432
Keep your finger in it.

1909
01:10:33,632 --> 01:10:34,762
I'm scared.

1910
01:10:34,762 --> 01:10:36,632
Start.

1911
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:38,832
(The equipment is turned on.)

1912
01:10:38,832 --> 01:10:40,132
Stick it in.

1913
01:10:41,002 --> 01:10:42,502
The one who gets an electric shock will be eliminated.

1914
01:10:42,502 --> 01:10:44,602
(I hope it's not me.)

1915
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:47,212
Na Eun, keep your finger on it.

1916
01:10:50,382 --> 01:10:52,512
(Screaming)

1917
01:10:52,512 --> 01:10:53,652
Yes!

1918
01:10:53,652 --> 01:10:56,122
(Se Chan has a 50-percent chance to stay with Na Eun.)

1919
01:10:56,122 --> 01:10:57,382
Hang Ho is eliminated.

1920
01:10:58,182 --> 01:10:59,252
I'm relieved.

1921
01:10:59,322 --> 01:11:00,552
I don't have to do it again.

1922
01:11:00,792 --> 01:11:02,662
What happens now?

1923
01:11:02,662 --> 01:11:04,592
- He'll stay with you. - He will?

1924
01:11:04,892 --> 01:11:06,592
You'll stay with me.

1925
01:11:06,592 --> 01:11:08,092
Yes!

1926
01:11:08,262 --> 01:11:09,832
(Disappointed)

1927
01:11:10,632 --> 01:11:12,732
(They stay together although their trust is broken.)

1928
01:11:12,732 --> 01:11:13,932
I don't want to do that again.

1929
01:11:15,602 --> 01:11:17,742
Na Eun and Sae Ho.

1930
01:11:17,872 --> 01:11:19,772
I want to stay with Na Eun.

1931
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:21,572
Ready, start.

1932
01:11:22,182 --> 01:11:24,442
(The game starts.)

1933
01:11:24,512 --> 01:11:26,212
Na Eun.

1934
01:11:26,352 --> 01:11:27,982
If Sae Ho has to stay, he'll be so embarrassed.

1935
01:11:28,752 --> 01:11:33,092
(Sae Ho is worried after expressing his feelings.)

1936
01:11:33,092 --> 01:11:35,052
(Screaming)

1937
01:11:35,362 --> 01:11:39,932
(I guess this is the end.)

1938
01:11:41,262 --> 01:11:42,332
Yes!

1939
01:11:42,332 --> 01:11:43,432
(Goodbye, Jae Seok.)

1940
01:11:44,932 --> 01:11:47,472
All right. The partners have changed.

1941
01:11:47,472 --> 01:11:50,572
Na Eun becomes my partner.

1942
01:11:50,742 --> 01:11:52,142
I'm here.

1943
01:11:52,912 --> 01:11:55,782
I wanted to stay with Na Eun.

1944
01:11:55,982 --> 01:11:57,942
Na Eun, let's win the game.

1945
01:11:57,942 --> 01:11:59,252
Let's win.

1946
01:11:59,252 --> 01:12:01,152
(My heart will be with you.)

1947
01:12:01,452 --> 01:12:04,522
There is only one mission left before the finals.

1948
01:12:04,522 --> 01:12:05,722
What is it?

1949
01:12:05,892 --> 01:12:09,162
You're going to play Knock Them Out.

1950
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:10,392
What's that?

1951
01:12:10,462 --> 01:12:12,062
You'll lose in these three cases.

1952
01:12:12,192 --> 01:12:16,462
If your hands come unclasped, if your back touches the floor,

1953
01:12:16,462 --> 01:12:18,132
or if you go out of the mat,

1954
01:12:18,132 --> 01:12:20,172
you'll lose.

1955
01:12:20,272 --> 01:12:22,842
The winning team will win 10 dollars...

1956
01:12:22,842 --> 01:12:24,342
and get the chance to change partners.

1957
01:12:24,372 --> 01:12:25,512
It sounds hard.

1958
01:12:25,512 --> 01:12:26,942
(It's the last chance to change partners.)

1959
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:29,582
This is our last chance.

1960
01:12:30,542 --> 01:12:35,882
(Who will win the game and avoid the penalty?)

1961
01:12:36,122 --> 01:12:37,752
We're one.

1962
01:12:37,752 --> 01:12:38,892
We're one.

1963
01:12:38,922 --> 01:12:40,152
Let's do this.

1964
01:12:40,352 --> 01:12:42,262
- They're coming. - Come here.

1965
01:12:42,422 --> 01:12:43,992
Come here.

1966
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:45,192
- Come. - 1, 2, 3.

1967
01:12:48,762 --> 01:12:49,962
Your feet smell.

1968
01:12:50,202 --> 01:12:52,702
So Min.

1969
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,202
(The smell of So Min's feet is distracting Jae Seok.)

1970
01:12:54,202 --> 01:12:55,372
What are you doing?

1971
01:12:55,472 --> 01:12:57,372
(It's a smelly attack.)

1972
01:12:58,442 --> 01:12:59,872
(I don't like the smell.)

1973
01:13:01,642 --> 01:13:02,882
(Smell attack)

1974
01:13:02,882 --> 01:13:04,412
Jae Seok is out.

1975
01:13:04,412 --> 01:13:06,252
Come on.

1976
01:13:06,252 --> 01:13:08,922
Na Eun, run away.

1977
01:13:08,922 --> 01:13:10,422
(Moving)

1978
01:13:11,822 --> 01:13:13,322
Are you attacking me?

1979
01:13:14,952 --> 01:13:16,792
Are you attacking me?

1980
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:18,162
- No. I'm supporting you. - You're attacking me.

1981
01:13:18,162 --> 01:13:19,532
I'm supporting you.

1982
01:13:20,862 --> 01:13:23,462
(I said we were one.)

1983
01:13:23,462 --> 01:13:24,962
- Are you attacking me? - No. I'm supporting you.

1984
01:13:24,962 --> 01:13:26,472
You're attacking me.

1985
01:13:26,472 --> 01:13:28,502
Push him.

1986
01:13:28,502 --> 01:13:30,502
- Push him. - There you go.

1987
01:13:30,502 --> 01:13:31,602
- Push him. - Na Eun, that's great.

1988
01:13:31,672 --> 01:13:33,012
That's great.

1989
01:13:33,012 --> 01:13:34,812
Soo Yong and Seok Jin are out.

1990
01:13:34,812 --> 01:13:38,442
(Both Seok Jin and Soo Yong are out.)

1991
01:13:39,452 --> 01:13:41,412
Hey, So Min!

1992
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:45,652
(Who is next?)

1993
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:48,822
Se Chan.

1994
01:13:48,892 --> 01:13:50,322
Let's attack Se Chan.

1995
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:53,262
(So Min noticed Se Chan.)

1996
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:54,792
Se Chan.

1997
01:13:54,892 --> 01:13:56,902
Let's attack Se Chan.

1998
01:13:57,062 --> 01:13:59,472
Why are you attacking me?

1999
01:13:59,472 --> 01:14:00,872
(Girls versus Se Chan)

2000
01:14:02,072 --> 01:14:03,572
Hey! It hurts.

2001
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:06,772
(The old partners have become enemies.)

2002
01:14:07,272 --> 01:14:08,912
What should I do?

2003
01:14:08,912 --> 01:14:11,312
(I couldn't attack my lady.)

2004
01:14:14,052 --> 01:14:19,752
(I'll leave for your sake.)

2005
01:14:23,122 --> 01:14:24,362
(Screaming)

2006
01:14:24,362 --> 01:14:25,432
Na Eun is out.

2007
01:14:26,392 --> 01:14:29,232
(So Min betrays Na Eun because she isn't much of a help.)

2008
01:14:29,232 --> 01:14:30,262
Na Eun is out.

2009
01:14:30,262 --> 01:14:31,702
I can't believe her.

2010
01:14:34,332 --> 01:14:37,742
(How dare she attack my lady?)

2011
01:14:37,742 --> 01:14:41,912
(My lady, I will avenge you.)

2012
01:14:44,282 --> 01:14:45,482
So Min is out.

2013
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:49,722
(The betrayer meets her end.)

2014
01:14:52,052 --> 01:14:53,652
(I will protect you until the end even if we are in different teams.)

2015
01:14:54,152 --> 01:14:55,892
Let's go slowly.

2016
01:14:55,892 --> 01:14:59,562
(While this beautiful story was unfolding...)

2017
01:14:59,562 --> 01:15:00,932
Wook Min. Wook Min.

2018
01:15:00,932 --> 01:15:02,362
Let's get Jong Kook.

2019
01:15:02,632 --> 01:15:05,502
- Hurry up. Let's get Jong Kook. - Let's get Jong Kook.

2020
01:15:05,502 --> 01:15:07,972
- Wook Min, let's go. - Wait a minute.

2021
01:15:07,972 --> 01:15:09,172
(They recruit the strong Wook Min.)

2022
01:15:09,372 --> 01:15:11,172
Let's go.

2023
01:15:11,172 --> 01:15:13,172
(Let's put our faith in Wook Min and attack.)

2024
01:15:13,172 --> 01:15:14,342
In 1, 2, 3.

2025
01:15:15,382 --> 01:15:16,812
He won't budge.

2026
01:15:17,142 --> 01:15:18,312
He won't budge.

2027
01:15:18,312 --> 01:15:20,382
What is going on?

2028
01:15:20,612 --> 01:15:22,522
Wook Min, kick.

2029
01:15:22,522 --> 01:15:24,422
- Can I kick? - Kick his thigh.

2030
01:15:24,752 --> 01:15:26,922
- Kick his thigh. - In 1, 2, 3.

2031
01:15:28,122 --> 01:15:29,722
- This is ridiculous. - Here comes Jong Myung.

2032
01:15:29,922 --> 01:15:31,562
Here comes Jong Myung.

2033
01:15:31,562 --> 01:15:33,162
Here comes Jong Myung.

2034
01:15:33,162 --> 01:15:36,102
(Jong Kook, let me help.)

2035
01:15:36,462 --> 01:15:40,602
(With a kind smile,)

2036
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:45,612
(he enters the fight to defend Jong Kook.)

2037
01:15:45,612 --> 01:15:46,742
Push him.

2038
01:15:47,072 --> 01:15:48,412
It worked.

2039
01:15:49,342 --> 01:15:51,742
(It took him 1 minute to come, but 1 second to get eliminated.)

2040
01:15:51,742 --> 01:15:53,582
In 1, 2, 3.

2041
01:15:53,812 --> 01:15:55,112
(Good luck, Jong Kook.)

2042
01:15:55,112 --> 01:15:56,322
We are almost there. Push.

2043
01:15:56,322 --> 01:15:58,592
- Can he go over the mat? - No, it's prohibited.

2044
01:15:58,592 --> 01:16:00,052
- It's prohibited. - He will be eliminated.

2045
01:16:00,052 --> 01:16:03,692
(Is this the end of Team Brothers?)

2046
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:05,862
(Of course not.)

2047
01:16:05,862 --> 01:16:07,432
My goodness.

2048
01:16:07,432 --> 01:16:09,062
(He runs towards the top.)

2049
01:16:09,062 --> 01:16:13,132
(Jong Myung is out, but Team Brothers is on the rise.)

2050
01:16:13,132 --> 01:16:14,702
Gather around.

2051
01:16:14,702 --> 01:16:15,842
(Jong Myung is out, but Team Brothers is on the rise.)

2052
01:16:15,842 --> 01:16:18,042
(Move out of my way.)

2053
01:16:18,042 --> 01:16:19,042
Ji Hyo is out.

2054
01:16:19,312 --> 01:16:22,182
(He easily overpowers the ace member.)

2055
01:16:22,182 --> 01:16:24,142
- Ji Hyo is out. - Wook Min is out.

2056
01:16:24,142 --> 01:16:26,212
(When was Wook Min eliminated?)

2057
01:16:26,212 --> 01:16:28,852
Wait a minute. Who should push Jong Kook?

2058
01:16:29,182 --> 01:16:31,482
Wook Min, go.

2059
01:16:32,592 --> 01:16:33,592
Bye.

2060
01:16:34,552 --> 01:16:35,962
- Wook Min. - What is this?

2061
01:16:35,962 --> 01:16:38,692
(He eliminates Wook Min because he isn't much of a help.)

2062
01:16:38,692 --> 01:16:40,462
- There we go. - My goodness.

2063
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:41,732
His effort was futile.

2064
01:16:42,602 --> 01:16:45,202
(Team So Min is eliminated.)

2065
01:16:45,202 --> 01:16:47,432
Wait a minute. We should join forces now.

2066
01:16:47,432 --> 01:16:48,972
Geun Sik, don't go that way.

2067
01:16:48,972 --> 01:16:52,342
He is attacking me.

2068
01:16:52,572 --> 01:16:54,372
(I am Park Geun Sik.)

2069
01:16:54,372 --> 01:16:56,782
(I always pay back.)

2070
01:16:56,782 --> 01:16:57,982
No, no.

2071
01:16:58,552 --> 01:17:00,152
You are out.

2072
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:02,782
- No, he isn't. - Geun Sik, come here.

2073
01:17:03,882 --> 01:17:06,622
(Geun Sik kicks.)

2074
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:07,852
Se Chan is out.

2075
01:17:08,322 --> 01:17:11,822
(The fighter's cells within his body are awakened.)

2076
01:17:11,822 --> 01:17:13,892
(He uses force...)

2077
01:17:13,892 --> 01:17:16,032
(to challenge Jong Kook to a one-on-one match.)

2078
01:17:16,032 --> 01:17:17,102
Hurry up.

2079
01:17:17,102 --> 01:17:21,172
(If I beat Jong Kook, victory will be near.)

2080
01:17:21,602 --> 01:17:22,842
Jong Kook is out.

2081
01:17:22,842 --> 01:17:25,642
(He beats Jong Kook.)

2082
01:17:25,972 --> 01:17:27,072
Jong Kook is out.

2083
01:17:27,872 --> 01:17:31,612
Geun Sik, you did it. We can win.

2084
01:17:31,812 --> 01:17:33,512
(We can win.)

2085
01:17:33,512 --> 01:17:37,352
(We can get back up.)

2086
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:38,952
(Let's join forces and seize victory.)

2087
01:17:38,952 --> 01:17:40,252
He is the last one.

2088
01:17:40,252 --> 01:17:41,592
Geun Sik will win for the first time.

2089
01:17:41,592 --> 01:17:43,192
Let's go, Geun Sik.

2090
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:44,762
Geun Sik.

2091
01:17:44,762 --> 01:17:47,332
- Geun Sik. - You jerk.

2092
01:17:48,092 --> 01:17:50,932
(We seized victory as one.)

2093
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:51,972
Sung Moon is out.

2094
01:17:53,472 --> 01:17:56,472
(They can't contain their joy after taking a win.)

2095
01:17:56,472 --> 01:17:58,402
Good job.

2096
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:03,312
(He kneeled,)

2097
01:18:03,312 --> 01:18:07,312
(shouted,)

2098
01:18:07,312 --> 01:18:12,022
(and showed his worst in the day of embarrassment.)

2099
01:18:12,922 --> 01:18:16,022
(The friends were ashamed of each other,)

2100
01:18:16,022 --> 01:18:19,462
(but united once again after a win.)

2101
01:18:19,762 --> 01:18:21,032
Congratulations.

2102
01:18:21,832 --> 01:18:23,132
Good job.

2103
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:24,462
(Haha and Geun Sik acquire 10 dollars.)

2104
01:18:24,462 --> 01:18:25,602
I am glad.

2105
01:18:26,032 --> 01:18:28,102
(Proud)

2106
01:18:28,302 --> 01:18:29,772
Everyone gave him a standing ovation.

2107
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:33,312
I will give you half.

2108
01:18:33,312 --> 01:18:34,642
Now,

2109
01:18:34,742 --> 01:18:37,242
Geun Sik, please come forward.

2110
01:18:37,682 --> 01:18:39,982
It would be hilarious if Geun Sik changed his partner.

2111
01:18:40,582 --> 01:18:43,352
Please tell me if you want to change your partner.

2112
01:18:44,952 --> 01:18:47,692
I will announce Geun Sik's decision.

2113
01:18:48,562 --> 01:18:51,662
Geun Sik, who has been Haha's friend for 20 years,

2114
01:18:51,662 --> 01:18:56,302
(Geun Sik has been Haha's friend for 20 years.)

2115
01:18:58,832 --> 01:19:00,102
decided...

2116
01:19:00,532 --> 01:19:01,732
to change his partner.

2117
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:08,272
(Thank you for giving me a chance.)

2118
01:19:09,012 --> 01:19:10,742
- My goodness. - You are good.

2119
01:19:10,742 --> 01:19:12,982
I have so much respect for Geun Sik.

2120
01:19:12,982 --> 01:19:14,652
- I respect him. - I respect him.

2121
01:19:14,652 --> 01:19:15,982
Geun Sik.

2122
01:19:16,882 --> 01:19:18,052
Geun Sik is good.

2123
01:19:18,052 --> 01:19:20,192
- It's the right choice. - Geun Sik is good.

2124
01:19:20,452 --> 01:19:22,322
He wants to change places...

2125
01:19:22,322 --> 01:19:23,762
with Sae Ho.

2126
01:19:23,762 --> 01:19:25,962
- Am I chosen again? - He wants to change places.

2127
01:19:25,962 --> 01:19:27,792
(Se Chan, the wealthy man, is very popular.)

2128
01:19:29,362 --> 01:19:30,732
He has good taste.

2129
01:19:31,162 --> 01:19:32,402
(Hello, my wealthy friend.)

2130
01:19:32,902 --> 01:19:34,572
(Haha is disheartened.)

2131
01:19:35,642 --> 01:19:37,442
Geun Sik hugged him right away.

2132
01:19:37,442 --> 01:19:39,542
(Geun Sik hugged Se Chan as if they were friends for 20 years.)

2133
01:19:39,542 --> 01:19:41,882
(Let's hug as well.)

2134
01:19:41,882 --> 01:19:43,642
I can't believe him.

2135
01:19:43,642 --> 01:19:45,412
(You know how I feel, right?)

2136
01:19:45,912 --> 01:19:49,122
Before we have the final mission,

2137
01:19:49,282 --> 01:19:52,722
I will reveal the rankings in terms of the mission fees.

2138
01:19:52,722 --> 01:19:54,552
I bet we are the last...

2139
01:19:54,552 --> 01:19:55,722
now that Haha has a new partner.

2140
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:58,362
Jae Seok and Na Eun have 60 dollars and 50 cents.

2141
01:19:58,362 --> 01:20:00,262
- That's a lot. - 60 dollars?

2142
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:03,402
- Jong Kook and Jong Myung. - Isn't it me?

2143
01:20:03,962 --> 01:20:05,902
- Are we in second place? - 45 dollars and 98 cents.

2144
01:20:05,902 --> 01:20:06,902
Are we in second place?

2145
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:08,132
Geun Sik must be very poor.

2146
01:20:08,132 --> 01:20:10,572
- He must be very poor. - You have no idea.

2147
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:13,612
In third place are Se Chan and Geun Sik.

2148
01:20:13,612 --> 01:20:14,672
How much do we have?

2149
01:20:14,672 --> 01:20:17,512
With 33 dollars, you are the richest member.

2150
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:19,682
- Oh, nice. - He has 8 dollars and 15 cents.

2151
01:20:20,612 --> 01:20:22,222
I am so annoyed. He has 8 dollars and 15 cents.

2152
01:20:22,222 --> 01:20:23,282
(He contributes about 19 percent to the team.)

2153
01:20:23,282 --> 01:20:25,082
I have so much respect for you.

2154
01:20:25,522 --> 01:20:28,092
In fourth place are Kwang Soo and Hang Ho.

2155
01:20:28,092 --> 01:20:30,522
- Are we in fourth place? - 34 dollars and 30 cents.

2156
01:20:30,622 --> 01:20:32,592
I revealed the rankings...

2157
01:20:32,592 --> 01:20:35,732
because you have a chance to turn the tables.

2158
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:37,502
Let's do this.

2159
01:20:37,502 --> 01:20:39,332
(How can they turn the tables?)

2160
01:20:39,332 --> 01:20:42,002
The final mission of the summer vacation special...

2161
01:20:42,002 --> 01:20:44,142
with the dangerous families gives a chance to turn the tables.

2162
01:20:44,142 --> 01:20:46,942
It's Revival of the Families.

2163
01:20:47,812 --> 01:20:50,512
In front of you are two game boards with numbers and units.

2164
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:52,852
One will throw a shoe to the board with numbers,

2165
01:20:52,852 --> 01:20:55,822
and the other will throw a shoe to the board with units.

2166
01:20:56,082 --> 01:20:58,992
The team will receive mission money that follows the combined amount.

2167
01:20:58,992 --> 01:21:01,122
(The team will receive mission money that follows the combined amount.)

2168
01:21:02,522 --> 01:21:04,492
(Last place will get an ice shower.)

2169
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:06,432
(1st, 2st, and 3rd places will get presents.)

2170
01:21:08,232 --> 01:21:10,162
Na Eun, we shouldn't be greedy.

2171
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:12,572
Let's aim for the middle.

2172
01:21:12,572 --> 01:21:14,432
- 2 or 10 would be nice. - 5.

2173
01:21:14,572 --> 01:21:15,942
Five is a good choice, too.

2174
01:21:16,242 --> 01:21:17,842
This is nerve-wracking.

2175
01:21:17,972 --> 01:21:19,142
Let's go!

2176
01:21:19,472 --> 01:21:21,812
Let's do this.

2177
01:21:22,212 --> 01:21:23,342
Na Eun, let's do this.

2178
01:21:23,842 --> 01:21:26,582
(Let's throw a shoe to the middle and remain in 1st place.)

2179
01:21:28,412 --> 01:21:29,852
- That's good. - She is good.

2180
01:21:29,852 --> 01:21:35,122
(The shoe makes an arc, and flies towards the board.)

2181
01:21:39,492 --> 01:21:40,692
You did it.

2182
01:21:40,692 --> 01:21:42,962
(She gets 4.)

2183
01:21:42,962 --> 01:21:44,502
Go for 10 dollars.

2184
01:21:44,502 --> 01:21:46,772
(The number is 4.)

2185
01:21:46,772 --> 01:21:50,472
(If Jae Seok gets 10 dollars, they will get 40 dollars.)

2186
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:52,772
- This is unbelievable. - Four is a good number.

2187
01:21:52,772 --> 01:21:54,142
It bounced in.

2188
01:21:54,142 --> 01:21:55,512
- What was it? - 40 dollars.

2189
01:21:55,512 --> 01:21:56,812
(If Jae Seok gets 10 dollars,)

2190
01:21:56,812 --> 01:21:59,782
(they will remain on the top.)

2191
01:21:59,782 --> 01:22:01,112
Get one cent.

2192
01:22:01,112 --> 01:22:03,182
- Then they will get 4 cents. - Get 1 cent.

2193
01:22:03,182 --> 01:22:04,922
- Let's get 40 dollars. - Get 1 cent.

2194
01:22:04,922 --> 01:22:07,222
(Please let me get 10 dollars for the unit.)

2195
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:10,792
(Will they get 40 dollars...)

2196
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:17,802
(and run away with a total of 10 dollars?)

2197
01:22:19,372 --> 01:22:20,602
- 1 cent. - 1 cent.

2198
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:22,672
(He gets a cent unit.)

2199
01:22:23,342 --> 01:22:25,642
(Jae Seok is unlucky through and through.)

2200
01:22:27,772 --> 01:22:30,682
(He doesn't disappoint.)

2201
01:22:30,682 --> 01:22:34,512
(The other unlucky members pay their respect joyously.)

2202
01:22:35,752 --> 01:22:38,592
- I am in awe. - In front of it is 10 dollars.

2203
01:22:40,052 --> 01:22:42,162
This puts a lot of pressure on me.

2204
01:22:42,892 --> 01:22:46,162
Throw it however you would like. Don't be nervous.

2205
01:22:46,162 --> 01:22:47,892
- It's okay. - Okay.

2206
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:50,002
You can make money by performing more surgeries.

2207
01:22:50,562 --> 01:22:51,702
Throw it.

2208
01:22:51,702 --> 01:22:53,332
Clear your mind, and throw the shoe.

2209
01:22:53,672 --> 01:22:54,772
Here I go.

2210
01:22:55,032 --> 01:22:57,542
- Okay. - All right.

2211
01:22:58,612 --> 01:23:01,212
That's too rough.

2212
01:23:01,212 --> 01:23:03,642
(He tries to avoid 1.)

2213
01:23:04,812 --> 01:23:06,482
(My goodness.)

2214
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:07,512
(Glancing)

2215
01:23:08,652 --> 01:23:12,222
(I am older than Jong Kook,)

2216
01:23:12,222 --> 01:23:17,462
(but why am I worried about his reaction?)

2217
01:23:17,462 --> 01:23:21,962
Jong Kook, smile.

2218
01:23:22,232 --> 01:23:26,532
Smile, smile

2219
01:23:27,832 --> 01:23:29,102
There is no hope.

2220
01:23:29,102 --> 01:23:30,172
Still.

2221
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:31,802
10 dollars.

2222
01:23:31,802 --> 01:23:32,872
(He gets 10 dollars.)

2223
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:35,882
10 dollars.

2224
01:23:35,882 --> 01:23:38,752
- Jong Kook. - Jong Myung is flustered.

2225
01:23:39,112 --> 01:23:40,852
(It sends a chill down his spine.)

2226
01:23:41,152 --> 01:23:45,622
Smile, smile

2227
01:23:45,892 --> 01:23:47,592
(Seething)

2228
01:23:47,592 --> 01:23:50,022
(They get 10 dollars, and fail to take 1st place.)

2229
01:23:50,022 --> 01:23:52,832
That was incredible.

2230
01:23:53,962 --> 01:23:55,962
- Aim for the end of the board. - Okay.

2231
01:23:56,062 --> 01:23:58,032
- The left side is okay, too. - Okay.

2232
01:23:58,502 --> 01:24:00,332
- Let's go. - Please do it right, Geun Sik.

2233
01:24:00,432 --> 01:24:01,602
- Geun Sik. - It's a good throw.

2234
01:24:01,602 --> 01:24:03,742
(Even though he only has 8 dollars,)

2235
01:24:03,742 --> 01:24:06,512
(he will redeem himself.)

2236
01:24:06,972 --> 01:24:08,112
Geun Sik.

2237
01:24:08,112 --> 01:24:11,312
(He becomes lucky and gets 10.)

2238
01:24:12,552 --> 01:24:14,812
(He is on fire towards the end.)

2239
01:24:15,482 --> 01:24:18,252
(He moves his new friend's heart.)

2240
01:24:18,352 --> 01:24:19,922
You're my friend.

2241
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,922
That's incredible.

2242
01:24:21,922 --> 01:24:23,562
Geun Sik has renewed energy.

2243
01:24:24,962 --> 01:24:27,262
That's incredible. They are already in third place.

2244
01:24:27,392 --> 01:24:30,662
He got 10? If they get 10 dollars, they win.

2245
01:24:30,662 --> 01:24:32,572
- Nobody can beat them. - It'll turn your lives around.

2246
01:24:32,572 --> 01:24:33,672
(He needs Geun Sik's luck right now.)

2247
01:24:33,672 --> 01:24:35,242
Ready.

2248
01:24:35,272 --> 01:24:36,302
Geun Sik.

2249
01:24:36,302 --> 01:24:38,872
(He needs Geun Sik's luck right now.)

2250
01:24:39,012 --> 01:24:44,242
(It's Se Chan's turn to get 10 dollars.)

2251
01:24:44,242 --> 01:24:47,252
(There's a 25-percent chance.)

2252
01:24:49,022 --> 01:24:51,382
(Go for your dreams.)

2253
01:24:52,052 --> 01:24:54,822
(It was a good day for Se Chan.)

2254
01:24:54,822 --> 01:24:59,062
(Will he get 1st place as well?)

2255
01:25:03,162 --> 01:25:06,302
(It's a penny.)

2256
01:25:06,302 --> 01:25:07,472
(He becomes breathless.)

2257
01:25:08,702 --> 01:25:10,272
What's that?

2258
01:25:12,112 --> 01:25:15,212
(That's what you get for leaving me.)

2259
01:25:15,282 --> 01:25:16,312
What's that?

2260
01:25:16,412 --> 01:25:18,582
(When you're once unlucky, you're forever unlucky.)

2261
01:25:18,952 --> 01:25:19,982
My gosh.

2262
01:25:21,582 --> 01:25:22,882
It's a penny.

2263
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,622
You're a true comedian.

2264
01:25:27,152 --> 01:25:28,922
- You're a comedian. - Geun Sik.

2265
01:25:29,762 --> 01:25:30,762
I'm sorry, Geun Sik.

2266
01:25:30,762 --> 01:25:32,432
(Se Chan and Geun Sik add a penny to 41 dollars and 15 cents.)

2267
01:25:32,662 --> 01:25:34,232
Should I do this? You do the other one?

2268
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:35,262
Okay.

2269
01:25:35,262 --> 01:25:37,602
This team currently has 34 dollars and 30 cents.

2270
01:25:37,602 --> 01:25:40,572
They get 1st place if they get 30 dollars.

2271
01:25:40,672 --> 01:25:43,372
- First place? - I like those eyes, Hang Ho.

2272
01:25:43,372 --> 01:25:45,342
- It's looking good. - I mean it.

2273
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:51,582
(What did he work so hard for?)

2274
01:25:53,312 --> 01:25:55,882
(He endured so much pain.)

2275
01:25:55,882 --> 01:26:00,092
(If he gets over 3, it would all be worth it.)

2276
01:26:01,652 --> 01:26:03,462
(Is it really 3?)

2277
01:26:07,392 --> 01:26:11,932
(Everybody is watching. Is it possible to turn the tables around?)

2278
01:26:14,372 --> 01:26:15,372
10!

2279
01:26:15,672 --> 01:26:16,672
What's that?

2280
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:19,572
(This team is very unlucky. He lands on 0 exactly.)

2281
01:26:19,572 --> 01:26:20,772
- What's that? - 10!

2282
01:26:20,772 --> 01:26:23,742
(The screen is not frozen.)

2283
01:26:25,582 --> 01:26:28,482
(Kwang Soo doesn't even get a turn.)

2284
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:32,292
(He freezes while getting ready to throw his shoe.)

2285
01:26:33,722 --> 01:26:35,492
(What went wrong?)

2286
01:26:35,492 --> 01:26:37,092
Come back. It's done.

2287
01:26:38,392 --> 01:26:40,132
It's done.

2288
01:26:40,132 --> 01:26:42,302
How's this even possible?

2289
01:26:43,262 --> 01:26:44,562
(Kwang Soo and Hang Ho shouldn't have stayed together.)

2290
01:26:44,562 --> 01:26:45,602
This is so funny.

2291
01:26:45,602 --> 01:26:46,872
(They finish off with the same amount.)

2292
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:49,472
- Let's go, Sae Ho. - Let's go!

2293
01:26:49,472 --> 01:26:51,042
(Haha and Sae Ho are currently in 5th place.)

2294
01:26:51,042 --> 01:26:52,972
(Haha gets 2.)

2295
01:26:52,972 --> 01:26:54,112
Go for cent.

2296
01:26:54,772 --> 01:26:55,782
It's cent.

2297
01:26:55,782 --> 01:26:56,842
(Sae Ho gets cent.)

2298
01:26:57,742 --> 01:26:59,212
(So Min and Wook Min are currently in 6th place.)

2299
01:26:59,212 --> 01:27:00,782
That's good. He got three.

2300
01:27:01,352 --> 01:27:03,282
- Good. - It's cent.

2301
01:27:03,282 --> 01:27:04,382
(She gets cent.)

2302
01:27:05,082 --> 01:27:06,092
That's three cents.

2303
01:27:06,352 --> 01:27:07,592
Good.

2304
01:27:07,952 --> 01:27:09,462
- It's 4. - It's 4.

2305
01:27:09,462 --> 01:27:11,322
(Ji Hyo gets 4.)

2306
01:27:11,822 --> 01:27:12,832
A dollar.

2307
01:27:12,832 --> 01:27:14,492
(Sung Moon gets a dollar.)

2308
01:27:14,492 --> 01:27:16,302
(They stay in 7th place with 19 dollars and 80 cents.)

2309
01:27:16,562 --> 01:27:18,462
This team is our hope.

2310
01:27:18,462 --> 01:27:21,332
Would they be able to get 100 dollars?

2311
01:27:21,332 --> 01:27:23,242
- Let's get 1st place. - We just can't get 0.

2312
01:27:23,242 --> 01:27:25,242
We just can't be last place.

2313
01:27:25,472 --> 01:27:27,842
That's right. This decides who's in last place.

2314
01:27:28,142 --> 01:27:29,782
- 50 dollars is good. - I'm praying.

2315
01:27:29,782 --> 01:27:31,812
- That's right. - 50 dollars is good too.

2316
01:27:31,852 --> 01:27:34,212
- I'm rooting for you, Seok Jin. - Let's show them!

2317
01:27:34,212 --> 01:27:35,282
Soo Yong!

2318
01:27:35,352 --> 01:27:38,892
- In 1, 2, - He's strong.

2319
01:27:38,892 --> 01:27:40,292
- 3. - That was good. It's 10.

2320
01:27:40,292 --> 01:27:42,192
(They're seasoned comedians. This is what variety shows are about.)

2321
01:27:42,192 --> 01:27:43,192
10!

2322
01:27:43,192 --> 01:27:46,332
(It's a 10.)

2323
01:27:47,232 --> 01:27:49,462
(It's a small miracle born out of hope.)

2324
01:27:49,462 --> 01:27:50,462
(We're going to be in 1st place.)

2325
01:27:50,462 --> 01:27:53,672
It's 10.

2326
01:27:55,842 --> 01:27:57,272
(That's touching.)

2327
01:27:58,202 --> 01:27:59,772
It's okay.

2328
01:27:59,772 --> 01:28:01,672
It's not yet.

2329
01:28:03,442 --> 01:28:05,312
- Don't be nervous. - I am nervous.

2330
01:28:05,482 --> 01:28:07,682
You're in the spotlight. How many years has it been?

2331
01:28:07,882 --> 01:28:10,752
(He feels the pressure of being in the spotlight.)

2332
01:28:12,252 --> 01:28:13,252
(All cameras are on me.)

2333
01:28:13,252 --> 01:28:14,552
If he gets a dollar, he won't be in last place.

2334
01:28:14,552 --> 01:28:15,922
(All cameras are on me.)

2335
01:28:17,262 --> 01:28:18,962
(If he gets a dollar, he's not in last place anymore.)

2336
01:28:18,962 --> 01:28:19,962
Let's go.

2337
01:28:19,962 --> 01:28:23,102
(If he gets 10 dollars, he's in 1st place.)

2338
01:28:23,462 --> 01:28:26,072
(This shoe is Seok Jin's hope.)

2339
01:28:26,072 --> 01:28:27,072
Good job.

2340
01:28:27,072 --> 01:28:31,242
(Please give me a miracle.)

2341
01:28:33,372 --> 01:28:34,842
It's 10 dollars!

2342
01:28:34,842 --> 01:28:37,212
(It's a 10-dollar miracle.)

2343
01:28:39,412 --> 01:28:42,382
(Seok Jin's team is the winner.)

2344
01:28:42,582 --> 01:28:45,752
(He gets 100 dollars in 1 shot.)

2345
01:28:45,752 --> 01:28:47,022
That's 100 dollars.

2346
01:28:48,452 --> 01:28:49,462
(They're shocked.)

2347
01:28:49,462 --> 01:28:50,862
Really?

2348
01:28:50,862 --> 01:28:52,532
I'm happy for you.

2349
01:28:54,462 --> 01:28:56,162
Are we in first place?

2350
01:28:56,162 --> 01:29:00,472
(They turn the tables around with 113 dollars.)

2351
01:29:01,332 --> 01:29:02,702
That's insane.

2352
01:29:04,142 --> 01:29:07,842
Ji Hyo and Sung Moon are in last place.

2353
01:29:07,872 --> 01:29:11,812
You can pick one team that'll join you for the ice shower.

2354
01:29:12,482 --> 01:29:13,612
(It's irrelevant to us.)

2355
01:29:13,612 --> 01:29:14,612
This is insane.

2356
01:29:15,382 --> 01:29:17,382
Don't look at them.

2357
01:29:19,792 --> 01:29:22,062
Please discuss first.

2358
01:29:22,062 --> 01:29:23,862
(Ji Hyo and her brother are thinking.)

2359
01:29:23,862 --> 01:29:24,862
I...

2360
01:29:25,232 --> 01:29:26,562
(Ji Hyo doesn't like moths.)

2361
01:29:28,562 --> 01:29:30,302
What's that?

2362
01:29:30,402 --> 01:29:31,432
That punk.

2363
01:29:32,372 --> 01:29:33,572
What's that?

2364
01:29:33,572 --> 01:29:35,342
(How dare you fly at Ji Hyo?)

2365
01:29:35,342 --> 01:29:36,672
- How dare you? - Goodness.

2366
01:29:36,772 --> 01:29:38,472
- How dare you? - Are you crazy?

2367
01:29:38,472 --> 01:29:40,742
- How dare you? Are you all right? - Are you okay?

2368
01:29:40,742 --> 01:29:41,772
Are you okay, Ji Hyo?

2369
01:29:41,982 --> 01:29:43,012
Are you okay?

2370
01:29:43,342 --> 01:29:45,082
- Come here, Ji Hyo. - Did you see what I did?

2371
01:29:45,082 --> 01:29:46,782
- Are you okay? - I was the first to charge.

2372
01:29:46,782 --> 01:29:47,882
Are you really okay?

2373
01:29:48,952 --> 01:29:53,092
(He snatches it,)

2374
01:29:53,092 --> 01:29:55,392
(and fights with it.)

2375
01:29:55,392 --> 01:29:57,022
It flew away. There it is.

2376
01:29:57,062 --> 01:29:58,222
It's flying away.

2377
01:29:58,222 --> 01:29:59,392
He has nothing in his hands.

2378
01:30:01,492 --> 01:30:05,402
(He tries to earn some points from her, but fails.)

2379
01:30:06,032 --> 01:30:07,032
Stand up.

2380
01:30:07,032 --> 01:30:09,442
(That didn't work.)

2381
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:14,872
Try being more sincere when acting.

2382
01:30:14,872 --> 01:30:15,882
All right.

2383
01:30:15,942 --> 01:30:17,742
- My ribs hurt. - We've made up our minds.

2384
01:30:18,782 --> 01:30:20,152
We've made up our minds.

2385
01:30:20,582 --> 01:30:23,582
On my cue, please say the team's name...

2386
01:30:23,582 --> 01:30:25,082
out loud.

2387
01:30:25,082 --> 01:30:26,092
(Who will join them?)

2388
01:30:26,452 --> 01:30:28,452
Ji Hyo, I love you.

2389
01:30:29,962 --> 01:30:31,322
That's so random.

2390
01:30:32,032 --> 01:30:33,962
That's too random.

2391
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:36,162
What's she doing?

2392
01:30:36,162 --> 01:30:37,762
What are you doing?

2393
01:30:39,402 --> 01:30:40,432
Hurry up.

2394
01:30:41,372 --> 01:30:43,502
Hurry.

2395
01:30:44,502 --> 01:30:49,582
(This is X-rated.)

2396
01:30:49,882 --> 01:30:51,882
Kwang Soo and Hang Ho are not doing anything.

2397
01:30:51,882 --> 01:30:53,412
In 1, 2, 3.

2398
01:30:53,412 --> 01:30:54,452
(It's time to decide.)

2399
01:30:54,452 --> 01:30:56,882
(Who will be joining them for the ice shower?)

2400
01:30:56,882 --> 01:30:57,882
Team Green.

2401
01:30:58,052 --> 01:30:59,892
Team Green.

2402
01:30:59,892 --> 01:31:01,292
(Congratulations, Kwang Soo and Hang Ho.)

2403
01:31:01,292 --> 01:31:05,592
Congratulations

2404
01:31:06,092 --> 01:31:07,962
(They all feel the same way.)

2405
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:09,662
(Welcome to the ice shower.)

2406
01:31:09,662 --> 01:31:11,032
Please join us.

2407
01:31:11,872 --> 01:31:12,872
I'm coming.

2408
01:31:13,832 --> 01:31:16,972
It's summer, so it'll be refreshing.

2409
01:31:19,612 --> 01:31:22,312
(Welcome. Is this your first time getting showered in ice water?)

2410
01:31:22,312 --> 01:31:23,542
There's so much water.

2411
01:31:26,182 --> 01:31:27,912
That's a lot.

2412
01:31:29,552 --> 01:31:30,752
Hang Ho did nothing wrong.

2413
01:31:31,352 --> 01:31:33,092
Do they stand up?

2414
01:31:33,092 --> 01:31:34,152
(I guess that's what the penalty is.)

2415
01:31:34,722 --> 01:31:37,362
This is the Family Special for Running Man's seventh anniversary.

2416
01:31:37,362 --> 01:31:39,662
It's the final ice shower penalty.

2417
01:31:39,862 --> 01:31:41,462
Ji Hyo, Sung Moon,

2418
01:31:41,462 --> 01:31:42,962
Kwang Soo, and Hang Ho.

2419
01:31:43,662 --> 01:31:45,602
Let's go.

2420
01:31:45,602 --> 01:31:47,732
- Let's do this. - Let's count down from seven.

2421
01:31:48,372 --> 01:31:49,642
This is the seventh anniversary after all.

2422
01:31:49,772 --> 01:31:51,042
Set, go.

2423
01:31:51,472 --> 01:31:54,572
- 7, 6, 5, - 7, 6, 5,

2424
01:31:54,572 --> 01:31:58,042
- 4, 3, 2, 1. - 4, 3, 2, 1.

2425
01:31:58,112 --> 01:31:59,812
Let's go.

2426
01:32:00,312 --> 01:32:03,482
(They get showered in ice water.)

2427
01:32:06,722 --> 01:32:09,262
(Not again)

2428
01:32:09,592 --> 01:32:15,302
(His pants fall off again after the radish game.)

2429
01:32:15,862 --> 01:32:17,862
What happened?

2430
01:32:17,862 --> 01:32:19,432
(Look at your pants, Kwang Soo.)

2431
01:32:19,432 --> 01:32:20,732
- Your pants. - Kwang Soo.

2432
01:32:20,732 --> 01:32:22,272
(What about my pants?)

2433
01:32:25,942 --> 01:32:27,772
What are you doing?

2434
01:32:27,772 --> 01:32:29,882
- What are you doing right now? - Hey.

2435
01:32:30,142 --> 01:32:33,152
- What are you doing? - This is too funny.

2436
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:34,152
Put them back on.

2437
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:36,082
My gosh.

2438
01:32:36,352 --> 01:32:38,152
This is too funny.

2439
01:32:38,952 --> 01:32:40,792
(You're the scene stealer.)

2440
01:32:40,792 --> 01:32:42,092
He's unbelievable.

2441
01:32:43,022 --> 01:32:45,892
This is not even possible. Is this a fiction?

2442
01:32:46,492 --> 01:32:48,462
It's not a fiction.

2443
01:32:48,862 --> 01:32:50,262
Is this computer graphics?

2444
01:32:51,062 --> 01:32:53,772
(What are we supposed to do about Kwang Soo?)

2445
01:32:53,772 --> 01:32:54,972
I'm sorry.

2446
01:32:55,402 --> 01:32:58,572
(Thank you for joining us for the 7th year anniversary.)

2447
01:32:58,872 --> 01:33:00,872
(Hot summer in 2017)

2448
01:33:00,872 --> 01:33:02,442
(There are 3 summer specials.)

2449
01:33:03,512 --> 01:33:06,112
(Part 1 is Find the Boss.)

2450
01:33:06,852 --> 01:33:09,782
(They are rising stars.)

2451
01:33:09,852 --> 01:33:12,452
(Park Seo Joon and Kang Ha Neul are ready for Running Man.)

2452
01:33:13,292 --> 01:33:14,352
(It gets more intense.)

2453
01:33:14,922 --> 01:33:18,222
(Part 2 is Bad Girls' Generation.)

2454
01:33:18,222 --> 01:33:20,932
(They're an idol group with 10 years of experience.)

2455
01:33:20,932 --> 01:33:24,202
(They're not naive anymore. They're seductive ladies.)

2456
01:33:24,562 --> 01:33:25,972
(It's more thrilling.)

2457
01:33:26,572 --> 01:33:29,772
(Part 3 is Running Man's Horror Special.)

2458
01:33:29,772 --> 01:33:32,512
(There are ghosts in here?)

2459
01:33:32,512 --> 01:33:34,742
(It's 100-percent real.)

2460
01:33:34,742 --> 01:33:37,382
(Don't trust anyone in here.)
