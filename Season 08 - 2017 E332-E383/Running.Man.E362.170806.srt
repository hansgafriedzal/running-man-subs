1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
(Parental guidance is advised for viewers under the age of 12.)

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,650
(One summer day after the rain in Yangju, Gyeonggi Province)

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,880
(It's a clear, summer day which fills the heart with excitement.)

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,890
The family special came to an end.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,250
- That's right. - That's right.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,820
So Min, the outfit you are wearing today...

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,460
is very elegant. Why is that?

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,830
I want to be feminine today.

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,870
(I want to be feminine today.)

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,440
(She suddenly shows her feminine side.)

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,200
(Does she have a change of heart?)

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,910
- Don't be ridiculous. - She heard about the guests.

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,440
She heard about the guests.

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,940
Don't tell the members who the guests will be ahead of time.

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,010
Whenever we have actors as guests,

16
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,020
the members act strangely.

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,090
Ji Hyo did that in her 1st and 2nd years.

18
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,990
- That's right. - She is dressed the same as usual.

19
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:49,990
You bet.

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,860
There is nothing left to show after seven years.

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,530
There is nothing I want to show.

22
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,730
She wore pot scrubbers instead of socks.

23
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,760
Hey,

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,330
- these socks are in style. - She wore pot scrubbers.

25
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,100
These socks are in style. For goodness' sake.

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,440
- Aren't these pot scrubbers? - My goodness.

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,570
(She sure is a member with 7 years of experience.)

28
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,540
- You are right. - Who drew Kwang Soo's...

29
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,480
- future portrait? - It's not my future portrait.

30
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,080
It's not my future portrait.

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,480
- Really? - His hair makes him look different.

32
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,180
If he pushes his hair back, he will look the same.

33
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,380
(It's his current portrait.)

34
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,750
No, I won't.

35
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,820
- He has a wide forehead. - That's not true.

36
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,550
(Jong Kook is right.)

37
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,290
- Are you sure about that? - It's okay.

38
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,220
- Stay still. Let's take a look. - It's okay.

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,160
(It's his current portrait.)

40
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,430
My goodness.

41
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,860
(Slapping)

42
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,200
Don't pull my hair back so far.

43
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,570
- Where does your forehead end? - Anyone would look bad that way.

44
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,200
Don't be ridiculous.

45
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,110
- It's okay. - Only you look bad that way.

46
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,170
His forehead goes on forever.

47
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,480
- He has a wide forehead. - Seriously.

48
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,480
All right.

49
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,710
Among Find Trilogy of Running Man,

50
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,220
the first episode will be joined...

51
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,820
by two special guests.

52
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,350
(Today is the D-day of the 1st episode of Find Trilogy.)

53
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,720
- Here they come. - They're here.

54
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,160
(Who are the guests who made So Min feminine?)

55
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,730
(Their silhouettes alone captivate women's hearts.)

56
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,670
Park Seo Joon and Kang Ha Neul.

57
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,170
(Park Seo Joon and Kang Ha Neul)

58
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,910
Welcome.

59
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:22,550
(The popular star, Park Seo Joon. The kindhearted man, Kang Ha Neul)

60
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,180
Kang Ha Neul.

61
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,380
- "Fight for My Way". - Hello.

62
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,490
Hello. Hello.

63
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,520
- Have you been well? - Come closer.

64
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,960
- Hello. - They are the stars...

65
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,230
Running Man discovered.

66
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,560
Running Man didn't discover them.

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,260
So Min is embarrassed.

68
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,270
(What is wrong with her?)

69
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,440
- Stop it. - You can stand next to them.

70
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,770
Why are you acting so shy?

71
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,010
- So Min. - Hello.

72
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,110
Please scoot over.

73
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,110
(She barely says, "Hello.")

74
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,780
(The guests turn So Min into a timid girl.)

75
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,650
What's wrong, So Min?

76
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,090
- I... - What's wrong with you?

77
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,790
Have you worked with them before?

78
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,050
- No. - No?

79
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,090
She is being ridiculous.

80
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,830
- She is being ridiculous. - She is pretending to be shy.

81
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,560
Don't force a romantic atmosphere. They don't want it.

82
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,630
Stick a spoon on your face.

83
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,970
Come on, Magnet Lady.

84
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,070
(Where is the magnet?)

85
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,970
I don't know why I feel so hot. I don't know. It's too hot today.

86
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,440
Stick this to your face.

87
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,810
(He turns her into the magnet.)

88
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,180
- Why is she acting this way? - For goodness' sake.

89
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,220
- Why do I feel so hot? - She is the magnet.

90
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,550
This is my first time seeing male guests on Running Man.

91
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,820
What about Hang Ho?

92
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,990
(He was on the show last week.)

93
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,160
Hang Ho and Geun Sik were here. What is wrong with her?

94
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,000
Did you forget about them already?

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't remember.

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,370
- She doesn't remember. - I don't remember.

97
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,840
(The special guests make her forget about last week's guests.)

98
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,540
The two guests are...

99
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,470
Park Seo Joon and Kang Ha Neul.

100
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,470
- It's nice to meet you. - Thank you.

101
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,840
They are cool.

102
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,880
Kang Ha Neul means "strong sky".

103
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,880
My goodness.

104
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,820
Strong sky. S.S.

105
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,180
S.S.

106
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,990
"Fight for My Way", Park Seo Joon.

107
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,290
"Fight for My Way".

108
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,890
Let's shorten the title and call it...

109
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,360
- Three MY. - Three MY?

110
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
Three MY?

111
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,330
They are the stars who captivate women's hearts.

112
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,560
Women fall for them.

113
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,930
They are incredible stars.

114
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,200
The nation fell for Seo Joon.

115
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,370
My goodness.

116
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,430
(He is currently the most popular star.)

117
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,800
- What about Ha Neul? - Don't do that.

118
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,470
- What about Ha Neul? - Don't do that.

119
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,570
You are joining the military soon, right?

120
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,470
- Yes, I am. - I see. Good luck.

121
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,540
(He joins the military in September.)

122
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,550
Why would you talk about...

123
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,180
- the military so soon? - It's a fact.

124
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,350
- Everyone was avoiding the subject. - It's fact.

125
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,450
- I will be back. - It's cool that he is going.

126
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,590
- You are so annoying. - It's cool that he is going.

127
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,290
- Work diligently before you go. - "Work diligently before you go."

128
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,720
The movie they star in...

129
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,260
will be premiering soon.

130
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,930
- The movie is on everyone's lips. - Is it on everyone's lips?

131
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,360
(It's unknown to Jae Seok.)

132
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,740
(We haven't heard anything. Are there rumors?)

133
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,000
Did you have to ask me in detail?

134
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,440
(Flustered)

135
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,770
- What rumor? - I mean...

136
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,610
I said it based on what we've talked about so far.

137
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,840
It's good to hear.

138
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,780
They say the movie is full of impressive and exciting scenes.

139
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,680
- It must've been great... - He's looking for...

140
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,490
a new master now that Joong Ki is getting married.

141
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,390
Am I some kind of a dog? Why would I look for a master?

142
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,190
- Do you want to hire him? - What?

143
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,430
Seo Joon, try him.

144
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,800
- He's a good servant. - Goodness.

145
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,560
- Don't mind him. - He's pretty loyal too.

146
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,900
- They're my close friends. - Goodness.

147
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,400
Feel free to use him as your servant. It's okay.

148
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,440
Today's race is the first part of Summer Vacation Special.

149
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,110
It's called, Find the Boss.

150
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,410
- "Find the Boss"? - All right.

151
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,810
(Summer Vacation Special, Find the Boss)

152
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,550
Today, you'll be divided into Team Police and Team Boss.

153
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,420
Seo Joon and Ha Neul are in Team Police to catch the boss.

154
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,620
They're the police.

155
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,150
(The two guests will run to catch the boss.)

156
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,920
The Running Man members are in Team Boss.

157
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,330
Among them, there are 1 boss, 6 villains,

158
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,260
and an undercover officer who will help Team Police.

159
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,760
(The undercover officer will support Team Police in secret.)

160
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,030
- Really? - "Undercover officer"?

161
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,440
Team Police will win if they find and arrest the boss.

162
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,410
The team will be awarded with 1,000 dollars.

163
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,580
- 1,000 dollars? - Yes.

164
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,140
(Successfully arrest the boss to receive 1,000 dollars.)

165
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,850
Team Boss will win if they find the briefcase which has money in it...

166
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,920
and succeed to escape.

167
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:25,090
They'll also win if Team Police arrests the undercover officer.

168
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,390
If Team Police arrests them...

169
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:34,500
(It's crucial for Team Police to guess who the others are correctly.)

170
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,940
(All right, I'll make sure to find them.)

171
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,040
Excuse me.

172
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,370
(Hello, I'm Kwang Soo, the undercover officer.)

173
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,080
- Is it you? - It's you?

174
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,210
- He's the undercover officer. - It's obvious.

175
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,610
(There's me too.)

176
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,550
(I'm Mapo Sheriff Haha, and I'm the undercover officer.)

177
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,860
- Goodness. - What was that?

178
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,320
(Let's get to it, my police friends.)

179
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,330
- He wants your attention. - It's me.

180
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,800
Okay, I see.

181
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,200
Why would she...

182
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,430
What's wrong with you?

183
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,670
(Who is the real undercover officer?)

184
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,100
- What is this? - Hello.

185
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,170
(1 hour before the guests' arrival)

186
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,970
- Hello. - It's so humid.

187
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,280
- Hello. - Hello.

188
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,080
- I know. What are these? - What are these?

189
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,010
- I can see what's inside slightly. - I guess there's something today.

190
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,450
Please choose a box among the boxes in front of you.

191
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,180
- Okay. - I choose this one.

192
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,290
- Goodness. - I'll choose what's in front of me.

193
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,120
- Okay. - I'll take what's left.

194
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,590
Number one.

195
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,690
(What is inside the boxes?)

196
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,830
I have a bad feeling about 2 and 4.

197
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,400
I've always chosen something disadvantageous.

198
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,900
(They finish choosing their boxes.)

199
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,840
Please show us the cards inside your boxes.

200
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,540
- Do we open it? - Yes.

201
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,170
(What's written in their cards will be their identities.)

202
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,740
- I'm a villain. - I'm a villain.

203
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,910
(Jong Kook is a villain.)

204
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,450
(Ji Hyo is a villain.)

205
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,080
I'm a villain.

206
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,990
I'm a villain.

207
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,190
- What? He's the police. - Kwang Soo!

208
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,860
Kwang Soo is the police.

209
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,230
He got something again.

210
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,130
(Kwang Soo is the undercover officer.)

211
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,900
- Is this a penalty? - Kwang Soo is the police.

212
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,960
He's the police.

213
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,270
There will be a boss who will lead Team Boss.

214
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,740
(Among them is the boss, the police's main target.)

215
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,470
It's me.

216
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,670
- No? - Isn't it me?

217
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,780
- What are you saying? - Isn't it me?

218
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,740
- It's me. - My goodness.

219
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,550
- No? - Why do you keep doing this?

220
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,320
Team Police including Kwang Soo...

221
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,050
will win if they arrest the boss.

222
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,420
Team Boss will win if they escape with their boss and money...

223
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,590
or make Team Police arrest...

224
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,330
Kwang Soo who is the undercover officer.

225
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,100
Make Team Police arrest...

226
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,660
It's not undercover though.

227
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,070
(This isn't undercover.)

228
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,370
Didn't you just say undercover officer?

229
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,070
Why don't you treat me like everyone else?

230
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,370
Treat me like you do to everyone else.

231
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,180
You have to pick your boss now.

232
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,580
- Okay. - Didn't you hear me?

233
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,280
Since you're the police, please leave the room.

234
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,480
- Get out. - Get out.

235
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,050
- Get out. - Right now!

236
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,050
- To where? - Get out.

237
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,150
- Get out. - Get out.

238
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,620
- Get out. - Excuse me.

239
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,950
- What are you saying? - Get out.

240
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,160
Get out already.

241
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,720
- Come on. - Get out.

242
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Get out.

243
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,690
- I pray for your soul. - What are you talking about?

244
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,360
What are you doing?

245
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,900
I think it'll be over soon.

246
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,400
- Get out. - Get out!

247
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,530
- I mean... - Kwang Soo...

248
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,900
- Go far away! - Am I on the other side?

249
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,400
- Right. - Kwang Soo...

250
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,500
- You're the protagonist today. - Go over to that side.

251
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,740
- Bye. - This is...

252
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,340
Am I really the protagonist of today's race?

253
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,840
- Hey! - I don't understand...

254
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,580
- Go! - Go away!

255
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,680
What? Okay.

256
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,250
(Miserable)

257
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,750
They're being too mean.

258
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,350
(He gets driven out to a further location.)

259
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,790
Go in this room and don't come out.

260
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,350
I can't come out of this room?

261
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,960
Go in already.

262
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,730
Why would an undercover officer get locked up?

263
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,130
Why would you lock me up?

264
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,900
I want a role that I can feel proud of.

265
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,030
(He's the undercover officer, yet he looks so miserable.)

266
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,000
All right. The boss will play a crucial role in today's race.

267
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,940
Your boss for today is...

268
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,710
(It's that person?)

269
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,910
- Who? - What?

270
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,680
It can't be!

271
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:12,220
(Who is today's boss that will lead the 7 Running Man villains?)

272
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,390
Simply put, the two guests...

273
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,720
and the undercover officer within Team Boss are one team.

274
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,930
Rest of them are all villains.

275
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,630
(7 Running Man members except for Kwang Soo are Team Boss.)

276
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,830
(The boss needs to hide their identity...)

277
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,600
(while Kwang Soo needs to reveal his.)

278
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,870
It could end right away, right?

279
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,270
You need to be very careful.

280
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,570
(Team Police, be careful.)

281
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,410
(He's being way too suspicious.)

282
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,710
- You know it's not him, right? - Don't trust him.

283
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,980
Let's stop talking.

284
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,950
(Trust me. I'm on your side.)

285
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,550
(How will the suspicious Kwang Soo's fate turn out to be?)

286
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,490
Come on. Don't do this.

287
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,290
Go sit next to Ha Neul.

288
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,060
Then push me harder.

289
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,160
Change seats with her, will you?

290
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,460
Push me harder.

291
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,230
Otherwise, I can't go there by myself.

292
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,230
Is this what you want?

293
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,300
She kept texting me. She was very persistent.

294
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,570
What's wrong with So Min?

295
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,300
I'm so surprised.

296
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,010
I asked her when the cameras weren't on.

297
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,780
I asked if it was Ha Neul or Seo Joon, and she said,

298
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,250
"Ha Neul is going to serve the military soon."

299
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,480
(She's after Seo Joon then.)

300
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,920
What are you thinking all by yourself?

301
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,150
She keeps struggling...

302
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,520
to choose between you two.

303
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,360
(She picked Seo Joon.)

304
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,990
- It's driving me crazy. - Date him until he joins the army.

305
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,000
Look how she applied lip gloss on her lips.

306
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,130
What's up with you?

307
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,670
(Shy)

308
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,370
So Hyun is well-known in SBS for not being hygienic.

309
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,900
She washed up today.

310
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,110
(The guests made her wash up.)

311
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,310
I can't believe this.

312
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,670
I'm sorry, but is that makeup on your face?

313
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,780
(She's a bodyguard.)

314
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,580
(Even a bodyguard put her makeup on today.)

315
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,910
- What? - Are you serious?

316
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,010
- Yes. - She applied makeup on her face.

317
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,850
I mean, we're close friends.

318
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,080
- I've never seen her smile before. - I mean...

319
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,620
- She's very unusual today. - Goodness.

320
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,690
She usually doesn't show any face expressions.

321
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,190
She usually never smiles.

322
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,790
- She's different today. - She's smiling.

323
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,530
Let's move on to the first mission where you can earn hints.

324
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,530
It's called, Show Me Your Charm.

325
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,170
(Find the Boss, Show Me Your Charm)

326
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,670
There are your talents and names written on those two roulettes.

327
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,340
You'll spin each roulette.

328
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,780
The selected person will show off their corresponding talent.

329
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,310
The staff judges give them marks, and the scores will be recorded.

330
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,790
Anyone can challenge others.

331
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,790
The person with the highest score in each area will be given a hint.

332
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,290
- A person who places first. - I see.

333
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,830
Team Police will be given a hint about the boss.

334
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,130
Team Boss will be given a hint about the money bag.

335
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,400
- Good. - Goodness.

336
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,030
Let's do well.

337
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,840
(My police friends, let's do this.)

338
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,900
(Is he the undercover officer?)

339
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,170
Don't try to get their attention.

340
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,570
Don't mind him.

341
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,710
Don't mind him at all.

342
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,440
Why do you keep doing this?

343
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,320
(When everyone is relaxed, someone is feeling very anxious.)

344
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,420
(Guys, they're all villains.)

345
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,450
Tell us honestly.

346
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,890
Do you have anyone in mind who you think is the undercover officer?

347
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,730
- Go with your first impression. - Right.

348
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,390
I first thought...

349
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,300
Ms. Jeon might be the one.

350
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,630
Ms. Jeon?

351
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,870
Why?

352
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,640
Call me So Min.

353
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,140
(Ha Neul, you can call me So Min.)

354
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,370
(It's okay.)

355
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,610
(What was that just now, So Min?)

356
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,810
Did you forget you're older than him?

357
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,050
My goodness, she's incredible.

358
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,080
- What are you doing? - What was that?

359
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,550
- It's how we used to flirt. - Goodness.

360
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,990
- Gosh. - She's scary.

361
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,260
So Min didn't say it normally either.

362
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,990
"Call me So Min."

363
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,530
(She sounded full of cuteness.)

364
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,000
Call me So Min.

365
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,070
(Ha Neul was flustered by her flirting.)

366
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,070
- What do you think you're doing? - I can't believe this.

367
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,670
Who do you think is the undercover officer, Seo Joon?

368
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,770
I think...

369
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,910
(Seo Joon, please.)

370
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:05,320
- I think it's Jong Kook. - You guessed right.

371
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,250
- That's how you feel now. - That makes me upset.

372
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,660
(The police are guessing wrong when he's right here.)

373
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,260
They were suspicious of me all the time,

374
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,860
and they're ignoring me completely today.

375
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,330
I think he's really upset.

376
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,070
There's nothing to be upset about.

377
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,770
Because I'm the undercover officer.

378
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,440
(He's frustrated.)

379
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,210
They're going for another person, and it's making me frustrated.

380
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,110
If you're the one, I'm the undercover officer too.

381
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,210
- You? - Yes.

382
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,510
If you're an undercover officer, then I am too.

383
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,310
Judging by the way you talk, you must be the boss.

384
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,520
(Why do you have to say it like that?)

385
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,050
That's right.

386
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,020
- It says so on your shirt. - That's me.

387
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,190
Quiet ones are likely to be undercover officers.

388
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,090
(It's definitely not Kwang Soo.)

389
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,560
Gosh, your face expression.

390
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,490
You look so serious.

391
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,900
(He successfully confuses Team Police.)

392
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,830
All right. Seo Joon and Ha Neul will spin the roulettes first.

393
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,500
- Okay. - All right.

394
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,300
- Ha Neul, please go ahead. - Me?

395
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,770
- Should I spin the one with names? - Yes, you should spin that first.

396
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,110
I have never spun a roulette before.

397
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,710
- I can just spin it, can't I? - Of course.

398
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,910
He's so cute.

399
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,910
All right. I will spin it.

400
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,480
(The staff members laugh.)

401
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,180
I will spin it.

402
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,190
- Okay. - Wait a second.

403
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,290
- Hold on, everyone. - Spin it.

404
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,690
Why is this funny?

405
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,990
Why did you laugh?

406
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,500
- What was funny about his line? - Is that so important now?

407
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,800
What was funny about that?

408
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,530
- So Hyun, why are you blushing? - I've never seen her like that.

409
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,230
- What is happening? - She likes him that much?

410
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,000
You didn't even laugh when my pants were taken off.

411
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,840
(He's feeling bitter.)

412
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,810
(The crew didn't laugh like this when his underwear was exposed.)

413
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,080
After all I've done...

414
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,150
I heard the crew staff watching that clip when they were editing.

415
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,620
- He's such a nice guy. - I haven't spun it yet.

416
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,060
- I'll spin this. - Okay.

417
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,530
In 1, 2, 3.

418
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,530
I'm curious which one will be picked.

419
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,830
- I bet he's not really curious. - "Which one will it be?"

420
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,370
What has Ha Neul picked?

421
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,110
(The first chance for Team Police to guess who the undercover officer is)

422
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,670
- Is it dancing? - Is it showing charms?

423
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,810
- Is it the charm? - Is it dancing?

424
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,110
- It's dancing. - I see. It's dancing.

425
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,450
- It's dancing. - Will it be a dance battle?

426
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,250
(The 1st round: Show Me Your Charm)

427
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,950
It's dancing.

428
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,590
- Play us the music. - Play a song for us.

429
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,990
- You know when people rap, - If you put on a good song...

430
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,960
- people rap in a cypher. - That's true.

431
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,890
- We should dance just like that. - Okay.

432
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,330
We will play the music, and you will evaluate right away.

433
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,560
We will keep playing songs.

434
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,530
If no one is dancing to a song, we will move on to the next song.

435
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,770
Please put on a song for us.

436
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,800
Let's go!

437
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,470
(Feeling the water)

438
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,080
(Wait. This isn't the song.)

439
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,010
- I already danced. - You don't know this song.

440
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,350
This song doesn't suit my taste in music.

441
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,320
Haha, that's great.

442
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,890
Let's keep going. Someone should dance. So Min?

443
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,550
- She's moving forward. - She's dancing.

444
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,420
- Look at her. - What's wrong with you?

445
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,560
Why is she being like that?

446
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,660
(What's wrong with you?)

447
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,260
- What's wrong with you? - What's the matter with her?

448
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,630
(She dances with her skirt.)

449
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,230
(The male judges are not even slightly affected.)

450
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,670
(Hey, cold-heated judges. So Min is on the move.)

451
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,210
(Ji Hyo is startled.)

452
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:15,870
What's the matter with her?

453
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,310
(She approaches them in a sexy and confident manner.)

454
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,810
(She begins dancing right before their eyes.)

455
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,050
What is wrong with her?

456
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,750
(She shows no reactions.)

457
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,290
(Hold on. What? What was that?)

458
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,520
(Her 1st attempt fails, and she targets Jae Seok's cameraman next.)

459
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,660
(Flapping)

460
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,660
(Please just go.)

461
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,660
(She desperately flaps for him, but it doesn't work at all.)

462
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,070
(He doesn't respond at all.)

463
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,440
(She finishes with sexy gestures.)

464
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,510
All right. That was So Min.

465
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,340
In 1, 2, 3. Evaluate her dance.

466
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,150
(So Min receives 10 points.)

467
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,020
(I'm satisfied with my score.)

468
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,280
So Min earned 10 points.

469
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,290
(Her dance earned 10 points?)

470
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,920
(Ji Hyo, feeling confident, moves forward.)

471
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,120
- Ji Hyo is dancing. - It's Ji Hyo.

472
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,760
(She gives off a relaxed vibe as she's been on the show for 7 years.)

473
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,790
Her socks look like the dish sponge made of steel.

474
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,600
She's dancing with those socks.

475
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,960
What's going on with Ji Hyo?

476
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,100
(Exposing)

477
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,830
(She sensually gets her groove on.)

478
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,670
(Ji Hyo, the queen, has descended. Everyone is going crazy for her.)

479
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,410
(The panelists are starting to show some interest.)

480
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,680
(You thought I was only sensual?)

481
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,680
(I can do some cute dance moves too.)

482
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,820
(Ji Hyo, you are a good dancer.)

483
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,880
This is...

484
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,550
Ji Hyo, that's right. Great!

485
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,550
(She even demonstrates some adorable footwork with the socks.)

486
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,560
That was a good one.

487
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,560
That was excellent. She danced well.

488
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,160
It was great.

489
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,100
Ji Hyo. Look at your score.

490
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,360
(Oh, my! My score is really high!)

491
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,600
- Well done. - She did very well.

492
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,800
- She got a lot of points. - Gosh.

493
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,470
- All right. - She's a good dancer.

494
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,240
(The fourth song is played.)

495
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,410
This song.

496
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,980
I like this song. My dance moves go perfectly with the song.

497
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,050
(The uplifting beat makes them move.)

498
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,850
(Should I dance too?)

499
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,650
Kwang Soo, you're going to dance?

500
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,690
- Haha, you should dance. - Kwang Soo, you're going to dance?

501
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,790
Kwang Soo!

502
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,120
(They've seen it before and don't have any expectations.)

503
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,260
(He reveals his back.)

504
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,860
(And now, he's dancing only with his bottoms.)

505
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,770
- So Hyun gave him a look. - I don't know where to look.

506
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,430
(The guys find Kwang Soo's move interesting.)

507
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,000
- Hey, that's good. - So Hyun.

508
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,410
(However)

509
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,670
(The ladies show no interest in his dance at all.)

510
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,910
They will evaluate now.

511
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,280
In 1, 2, 3. Show us the score.

512
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,520
Look. He got negative five points.

513
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,780
(Someone in the panel gave Kwang Soo...)

514
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,720
(negative 5 points?)

515
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,390
(Kwang Soo gets negative 3 points.)

516
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,760
His final score is negative three points.

517
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,790
His score is negative three points.

518
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,660
We're going to continue.

519
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,700
(The fifth song is played.)

520
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,470
All right. Ha Neul, do you like this song?

521
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,400
- Ha Neul. - What do you think?

522
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,270
- Go and dance! - That's all right. Come.

523
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,310
(Ha Neul, you should dance.)

524
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:05,380
(With Ha Neul's dance, the real dance competition begins now.)

525
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,580
Let's go!

526
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,380
(Ha Neul shows off unexpected dance skills.)

527
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,120
(The path he walks on is covered with a red carpet.)

528
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,790
(I just saved Ha Neul in my heart.)

529
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,360
(We're going to keep him in our hearts forever.)

530
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,190
(Ha Neul is the best!)

531
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,500
(I'm happy that I decided to join Running Man's crew.)

532
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,460
(Wiping)

533
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,570
(This wipe-the-floor dance move is new.)

534
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,540
(She can't keep her composure.)

535
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,670
(His dance move is appealing to the ladies.)

536
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:39,010
(I came here to catch the boss, but I ended up wiping the floor.)

537
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:42,450
(I'm the king of this floor.)

538
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,220
I can't dance.

539
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,120
What is his score?

540
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,320
(Ha Neul says he can't dance. What score did he get?)

541
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,120
(He gets 350 points from someone.)

542
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,920
- What are you doing? - No way.

543
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,890
(Do you think that makes sense?)

544
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,260
- This is ridiculous. - Is this how you're going to play?

545
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,030
- Goodness. I can't believe it. - By the way,

546
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,630
the bodyguard gave Ha Neul the highest score she could give.

547
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:03,940
She gave him 5 points.

548
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,540
That was the highest score she could give.

549
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,340
The final score is 363 points.

550
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,640
He got 363 points, but I got negative 3 points?

551
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,350
(Ha Neul's score is 363 points, and Kwang Soo's is negative 5 points.)

552
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,650
(The difference is 368 points.)

553
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,820
But the thing is that even the bodyguard...

554
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,090
gave Ha Neul the highest score she could give him.

555
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,390
Thank you.

556
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,360
The first round goes to Ha Neul.

557
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,730
(The winner, Ha Neul, acquires a hint.)

558
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,160
All right.

559
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,330
I want expression.

560
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,370
- It's power. - Power.

561
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,400
It's about power.

562
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,900
- Jong Kook has the upper hand. - He's at an advantage.

563
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,970
(Let me properly show you my charm.)

564
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,380
(Which one of them will get to show off their power?)

565
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,180
- He's so handsome. - He's right here.

566
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,250
Seo Joon just picked himself. It's him.

567
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,980
(This is an era where everyone promotes themselves.)

568
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,920
(The last member who defeats Seo Joon will receive the hint.)

569
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,620
- Who is that? - You should've practiced first.

570
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,720
Seo Joon spun the roulette and chose himself.

571
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,830
Since all of you said that you were undercover officers,

572
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,660
- you will let him win, won't you? - That's right. Wait, no.

573
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,830
The undercover officer should let him win.

574
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,730
Ha Neul, you are sharp.

575
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,030
He is indeed.

576
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,370
This time, you will play Leg Wrestling to show your charm.

577
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,070
(The 2nd round: Leg Wrestling)

578
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,980
(I will teach you a lesson with this game.)

579
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,850
I think Se Chan will win.

580
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,280
The undercover officer will...

581
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,750
- tire us out in this round. - Se Chan will win.

582
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,290
(I have to help Team Police win this round.)

583
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,290
Get ready.

584
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,820
- Set. - Go easy on me.

585
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,460
- I can just make them split, right? - Right.

586
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,330
(We are both villains. Let's go easy on each other.)

587
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,460
Start.

588
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,160
(In pain)

589
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,700
(I won't go easy on you.)

590
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,500
It's over.

591
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,500
(The game ended in less than a second.)

592
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,940
I won't let you off, Haha.

593
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,410
Next challenger, come forward.

594
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,240
Whoever is next, come.

595
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,280
- Se Chan is good. - Who's next?

596
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,680
(I will beat everyone and get the hint for the money bag.)

597
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,010
- He's that powerful? - Seok Jin.

598
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,220
- He's no joke. - Come here.

599
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,350
He's really strong.

600
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,650
Start.

601
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,790
(Screaming)

602
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,590
(Se Chan shows off his manly side.)

603
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,320
- I'm not lying. - Who's next?

604
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,660
I'm telling the truth.

605
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,130
- Who are you? - I'm serious.

606
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,060
- I wasn't trying to be funny. - What is this?

607
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,430
Seok Jin, you didn't try to be funny, did you?

608
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,960
- He's really strong. - Goodness, Se Chan.

609
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,000
- Gosh. - Look at you, Se Chan.

610
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,940
- You're that strong? - Kwang Soo.

611
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,200
Kwang Soo, you should go next.

612
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,240
Through this game,

613
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,610
I will show you that I am the undercover officer.

614
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,210
Get ready. Start.

615
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,850
(Screaming)

616
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,220
(You have to do better than that, undercover officer.)

617
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,580
Stop. That's enough.

618
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,990
Se Chan is really strong.

619
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,760
- It wasn't even close. - Se Chan is...

620
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,620
- Se Chan is the strongest. - Kwang Soo.

621
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,760
Who's next?

622
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,100
Who's next? Jong Kook.

623
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,430
Se Chan. Hey.

624
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,140
Goodness, Se Chan.

625
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,540
Look at Jong Kook.

626
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,270
(His legs are as thick as a mammoth's.)

627
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,980
You're going to try to widen the gap first?

628
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,180
Or do you want to go first?

629
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,280
- He must be tired by now. - Get ready.

630
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,650
- That's true. - Set.

631
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,050
If you want this game to be fair...

632
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,420
(Punching)

633
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,690
(The undercover officer makes the game more fair.)

634
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,190
I should punch them. I did it to make the game fair.

635
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,560
- It's only fair. Se Chan is tired. - Good job.

636
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,030
- Se Chan used up a lot of energy. - Kwang Soo.

637
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,630
- Hold on. - That hurt.

638
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,360
He used up a lot of his energy.

639
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,500
- He caught me off guard. - I was trying to make this fair.

640
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,670
- It should be a fair game. - Okay.

641
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,970
- You're amazing. - Hey, Kwang Soo.

642
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,770
("A fair society is not far away from us." Lee Kwang Soo)

643
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,340
- Get ready. - That was amazing.

644
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,610
Set.

645
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,140
Goodness. Wait. Hold on, Jong Kook.

646
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,680
(Wait. We didn't even start yet.)

647
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,680
You're hurting me. Give me a second.

648
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,180
- We didn't start yet. - Okay, fine.

649
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,650
Start.

650
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,090
(As soon as it begins, he starts laughing.)

651
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,590
- Jong Kook wins. - It's over.

652
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,430
(As expected, Se Chan's unexpected charm stops here.)

653
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,930
- Ha Neul, you should try it. - Did you see that?

654
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,100
Ha Neul's lower body is strong too.

655
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,570
- By the way, Team Police... - Goodness, Jong Kook.

656
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,970
You're the undercover officer, aren't you?

657
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,540
(I have a feeling Jong Kook is the undercover officer.)

658
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,670
Are you the undercover officer?

659
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,910
Well... Later...

660
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,480
- The undercover officer... - Seo Joon...

661
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,580
- Seo Joon and I are the police. - Yes.

662
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,710
(If Jong Kook is an officer, he'll try to help the police.)

663
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,920
Wait.

664
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,420
I'm scared.

665
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,590
It hurts.

666
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,250
It really hurts.

667
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,120
Strong Sky, don't be like that.

668
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,360
- All right. - Ha Neul, you have strong legs.

669
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,390
All right.

670
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,060
Eliminate him as soon as the game starts.

671
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,600
- Take it easy. - All right.

672
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,930
Start.

673
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,570
Ha Neul is holding out.

674
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,570
He's strong.

675
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,840
(Surprised)

676
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,440
- You're strong. - He's strong.

677
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,010
(Both are determined to win.)

678
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:41,180
(Who will win the hint?)

679
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,480
(I'm the passionate police, Kang Ha Neul.)

680
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,020
(Screaming)

681
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,720
(You can see how much pain he is in.)

682
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,760
Wait.

683
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,930
- Good job. - Good job.

684
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,460
Good job.

685
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,460
(You can go now.)

686
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,700
Good job, Ha Neul.

687
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,100
- Ha Neul. - It's not because you're weak.

688
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,270
Jong Kook won, right?

689
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,500
(It's hard to be the police.)

690
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,900
It hurts.

691
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,010
- Is it my turn now? - It is.

692
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,440
Let's give him a big hand.

693
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,110
(Will Seo Joon be able to beat Jong Kook?)

694
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,850
Jong Kook is impossible to beat.

695
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,650
(Will he be able to win the hint about the boss?)

696
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,220
How am I supposed to beat Jong Kook?

697
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,220
(The police have to win.)

698
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,390
(But it's the wrong match.)

699
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,460
Ready.

700
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,060
One more time. Here you go.

701
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,260
Gosh.

702
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,460
I mean,

703
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,100
it's to be fair.

704
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,830
It's to be fair.

705
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,870
You need to lose a bit of energy.

706
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,640
Jong Kook.

707
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,800
Is this okay?

708
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,370
Can he do that?

709
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,110
- Why isn't anyone stopping him? - This is the finals.

710
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,210
- This is the finals. - He hit me three times.

711
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,610
He hit me three times.

712
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,380
Three times.

713
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,350
- Three times is okay. - Didn't you see that?

714
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,220
Three times is okay.

715
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,390
Calm down.

716
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,090
(It feels like the police have just won.)

717
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,190
- Ready. - Goodness.

718
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,760
Ready.

719
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,530
- I don't know what to do. - Seo Joon works out a lot too.

720
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,460
(The king has become weak. I'll show you a miracle.)

721
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,700
(His body has been trained through action scenes.)

722
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,200
(When it comes to strength, I'm confident.)

723
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,700
Warm up your body.

724
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:16,440
His legs feel strong.

725
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,410
(Will the police miraculously win?)

726
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,710
- Start. - Nice.

727
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:24,520
(Will the police miraculously win?)

728
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,220
- Start. - Nice.

729
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,060
(His legs spread.)

730
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,730
(His legs are forced to spread.)

731
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,630
(Jong Kook is amazing.)

732
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,600
This is Jong Kook.

733
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,800
I'm sorry.

734
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,640
Jong Kook is the power boss.

735
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,170
(Jong Kook is the power boss.)

736
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,610
This was pointless.

737
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,010
(Jong Kook is the power boss.)

738
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,710
Expression would be the best.

739
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,520
(Show Me Your Charm)

740
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,620
- What is "expression"? - What is "expression"?

741
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,650
- Expression... - Cuteness...

742
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,920
- Cuteness. - It's cuteness.

743
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,360
Cuteness.

744
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,890
- Cuteness? - So Min is going to win.

745
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,560
- It's Haha. - Please.

746
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,300
- Haha. - Haha.

747
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,160
(Haha has to go first.)

748
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,170
I hate it.

749
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,900
This is hard.

750
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,100
But you're good at it.

751
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,740
Haha used to be very good at it.

752
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,970
- But now... - He has kids now.

753
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,140
He has become shy.

754
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,780
- But you have no choice. - I have no choice.

755
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:28,110
Don't worry. You don't have to win.

756
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,850
You don't have to win.

757
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,620
(Shy)

758
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,320
Is he supposed to just start?

759
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,450
Like this?

760
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,450
(Just here?)

761
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,420
Aren't you going to give me an example?

762
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,490
No.

763
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,460
Is he just supposed to act cute?

764
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,630
Just like this?

765
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,600
- Yes. - Without any help?

766
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,100
That would be a problem.

767
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,200
(That would be a problem.)

768
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,270
(Shocked)

769
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,970
(Cute)

770
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,910
I can't do this if you don't give me any lines.

771
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,910
(Doesn't he just look stupid?)

772
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,650
- The score... - 1, 2, 3.

773
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,980
Don't be like that.

774
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,550
I'm disappointed.

775
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:11,620
- He won three points. - I'll fart if I'm upset.

776
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,790
(What is he saying?)

777
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,730
- Excuse me, I'm very curious... - Don't do this to me.

778
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,330
why you gave him three points.

779
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,000
Why did you give him three points?

780
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,070
- Why did you do that? - Otherwise, he wouldn't go away.

781
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,970
- He was trying. - He was trying.

782
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,640
Thank you.

783
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,440
Ji Hyo, you should try.

784
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,980
- There you go. - You look cute.

785
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,410
You look cute now.

786
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,210
- You look very cute. - You look cute.

787
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,850
Here it comes.

788
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,850
Let's go.

789
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,480
(She's ready to be cute.)

790
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,720
- You're doing great. - Should we give her a situation?

791
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,120
Someone is leaving,

792
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,090
and you want to stop him.

793
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,590
- Right. - Her boyfriend is leaving her.

794
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,100
That's right. Ji Hyo.

795
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,900
You think you could give him your everything.

796
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,900
I'm leaving.

797
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,200
(It's time for Ji Hyo to be cute.)

798
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,600
Here it comes.

799
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,410
Honey, don't go.

800
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:05,110
(Honey, don't go.)

801
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,410
Isn't that a gangster?

802
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,750
Isn't that the movie "Friend"?

803
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,520
"I've had enough."

804
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,090
- All right. - Wait.

805
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:17,960
- You want to try again? - You know, I love you

806
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,890
Gosh.

807
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,260
(Giving up)

808
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,800
(For the tough Ji Hyo, this is a difficult mission.)

809
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,140
1, 2, 3.

810
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:32,970
What?

811
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,170
50 points?

812
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,310
Thank you.

813
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,310
You know, I love you

814
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,610
He gave her 50 points.

815
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,180
He has finally revealed his taste.

816
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,720
He's blushing.

817
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,050
He likes Ji Hyo.

818
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,120
He likes Ji Hyo.

819
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,360
Gosh, this is so hard.

820
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,590
- Jong Kook. - If Jong Kook does it,

821
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,060
- It'll be awesome. - it'll have an impact.

822
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,100
Can you give me a situation?

823
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,200
Well...

824
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,200
Let's say you're at a gym.

825
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,000
(It's his home ground.)

826
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,170
Someone is drinking a protein shake.

827
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,940
- He wants a sip. - Someone is doing something wrong.

828
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,140
I want to correct her.

829
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,810
A girl is doing an exercise incorrectly.

830
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,540
Let's do that.

831
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,380
(Thinking)

832
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:17,220
(I can do this.)

833
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,480
(To win the hint,)

834
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,390
(he has to win the most points.)

835
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,360
(Sulking)

836
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,730
(Don't do that.)

837
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,300
The floor just vibrated.

838
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,200
(His footsteps are shaking the place.)

839
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,800
What is this?

840
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,770
What's that?

841
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,170
You shouldn't do that.

842
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:44,410
(You shouldn't do that.)

843
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:47,310
- What? - What is with him?

844
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:48,850
(What is wrong with him?)

845
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,280
Are you crazy?

846
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,120
(Too cute)

847
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,190
He's crazy.

848
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,620
(Scared)

849
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,460
You're crazy.

850
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,560
(He gets kicked.)

851
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,330
Wake up.

852
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,330
- Are you crazy? - What?

853
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,070
- I'm cute, aren't I? - Pull yourself together.

854
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,300
(Sulking)

855
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,100
It was so scary.

856
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,600
- It was really scary. - How was it?

857
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,170
It was so scary.

858
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,640
You'll get minus points.

859
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,280
- Minus 20 points. - Minus 20 points.

860
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,110
What?

861
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,850
2 of them gave him 4 points.

862
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,080
Gosh.

863
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,720
- That was crazy. - I did an amazing job.

864
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,120
You were very cute.

865
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,220
(I'm being generous.)

866
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,520
So Min...

867
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,120
So Min is good at it.

868
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:33,990
Let's say So Min is late.

869
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,930
Something happened to her family, so she's late.

870
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,400
Let's start. Seo Joon, say something.

871
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,700
What time is it? Why are you so late?

872
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,000
I'm sorry.

873
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,340
I'm sorry I'm late.

874
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,510
(Shocked)

875
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,010
I'm sorry.

876
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,010
(What is this?)

877
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,550
- Forgive me. - Look at Seo Joon.

878
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,380
- Seo Joon is still angry. - Please forgive me.

879
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,380
Next boyfriend.

880
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,950
(Next boyfriend)

881
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,520
(It's not just because she's late.)

882
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,420
All right. So Min.

883
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,230
This is how you broke up with Seo Joon.

884
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,360
He couldn't accept it.

885
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,770
You broke up with him.

886
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,700
And then you got a new boyfriend.

887
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,370
All right. This time,

888
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,340
Ha Neul is late.

889
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,840
Both of them are cute.

890
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,380
What should I do?

891
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,440
Start.

892
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,750
I'm sorry. My bus was late.

893
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,620
The subway was late too.

894
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,260
It's okay, Ha Neul.

895
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,660
Ha Neul, it's okay.

896
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,530
This is not a kindergarten.

897
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,960
(This is not a kindergarten.)

898
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,300
You're supposed to be cute.

899
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,430
So Min, speak clearly.

900
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,470
- Speak clearly. - Speak clearly.

901
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,670
- Stop mumbling. - You're doing it wrong.

902
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,110
- You're a grown-up. - She's a four-year-old.

903
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,940
You're not a kid. Try again.

904
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,340
Gosh.

905
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,740
But some people speak that way.

906
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,750
- You're right. - You're right.

907
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,150
Start.

908
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:07,890
My bus was late, and my subway was late too.

909
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,550
- Okay. - So...

910
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,290
- So... - Okay.

911
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,430
That's why I'm late. I'm sorry.

912
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,930
Is she a baby?

913
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,400
It's okay. Ha Neul.

914
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,200
I love you.

915
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,170
(Ha Neul, I love you.)

916
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,800
- I love you more. - I love you.

917
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,570
(The studio is full of love.)

918
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,640
I love you more.

919
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,480
What are you doing?

920
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,710
- What are you doing? - What?

921
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,910
What are you doing?

922
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,350
- I mean... - Are you jealous?

923
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,710
- Why would she say she loves him? - Are you jealous?

924
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,620
They're not supposed to say they love each other.

925
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,120
- Are you jealous? - They're supposed to be cute.

926
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,920
- They're not in love. - What is this?

927
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,150
What are you doing?

928
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,420
He's jealous. It's strange.

929
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,590
It's strange.

930
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:50,200
Let's see So Min's score.

931
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,200
Please show us.

932
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
15 points.

933
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:57,570
So Min tried so hard, but So Hyun gave her only one point.

934
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,870
That's mean.

935
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,470
You're also mean.

936
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,070
Let's find out Ha Neul's score.

937
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,580
- I bet it's high. - 1, 2, 3.

938
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,680
(What is Ha Neul's score?)

939
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,110
My goodness.

940
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,920
His total score is 85.

941
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,890
(Thank you for being generous.)

942
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:14,990
By the way,

943
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,720
- the bodyguard gave him... - Thank you.

944
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,460
- five points. - It's the highest score.

945
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,990
She gave him the highest score.

946
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,230
(The highest she could give was 5 points.)

947
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,600
(You were very cute, Ha Neul.)

948
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,770
She couldn't give 40 points like the others,

949
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:31,340
but she gave him her perfect score.

950
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,910
- Thank you. - Next up is Seo Joon.

951
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,370
Seo Joon is good.

952
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,080
I'll do it in front of the judges.

953
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,280
Please go ahead.

954
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,980
Which judge?

955
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,810
I'll do it for So Hyun.

956
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,320
My goodness.

957
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,920
So Hyun, it's game over.

958
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,120
(She's overwhelmed by gratitude.)

959
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,350
So Hyun.

960
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,320
(Park Seo Joon comes toward her.)

961
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,620
You'll be happy from now on.

962
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,430
(We've never seen such a big smile on her face.)

963
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,760
I'm jealous.

964
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,130
Goodness.

965
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,100
- Stay focused, So Hyun. - She's blushing.

966
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,070
You're a judge. You're still working.

967
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,340
She's blushing.

968
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,270
Start.

969
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,210
(Her heart flutters just by looking at him.)

970
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,040
Look at him in the eyes.

971
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,080
So Hyun.

972
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,880
When other members give you a hard time,

973
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,550
I feel very bad.

974
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,390
(Laughing)

975
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:23,520
(So Hyun is knocked out.)

976
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,060
(She doesn't feel bad at all.)

977
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,990
That's it. It's game over.

978
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,500
(That's it for today's shoot.)

979
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,500
(What's wrong with him?)

980
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,330
- Keep going. - Keep going.

981
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,470
Why are you over there?

982
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:39,240
Leave me alone. He's so cute.

983
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,810
May I do it again to another judge?

984
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:42,840
Of course.

985
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,740
He's getting greedy.

986
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,940
So Min, sit down.

987
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,680
(Seo Joon attempts to act cute in front of the bodyguard.)

988
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,280
Her highest score is five points.

989
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,490
- Will he break the record? - Will he earn more than five?

990
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,560
(The charismatic judge always remained objective.)

991
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,460
(Go ahead, and give it a try.)

992
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,900
He's kneeling.

993
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,570
(He kneels in front of her. Will he win her heart?)

994
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:11,740
If you don't give me a high score,

995
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,370
I'll be sad.

996
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:16,110
(If you don't give me a high score, I'll be sad.)

997
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,340
(She tries not to smile.)

998
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,680
(He ends with a cute sound.)

999
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,720
(Yoon Jung is also knocked out.)

1000
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,580
She also fell for him.

1001
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,050
She fell.

1002
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,250
(She gives him 50 points.)

1003
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,290
It's 50 points.

1004
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,690
She gave him 50 points.

1005
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,990
She gave you 50 points.

1006
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,230
(It's a celebration.)

1007
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,500
- Let's see. - It worked.

1008
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,470
1, 2, 3.

1009
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,330
Goodness.

1010
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:45,640
(The scores become much higher.)

1011
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,140
His total score is 621.

1012
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,540
(Seo Joon has the highest score.)

1013
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,310
(He wants to try as well.)

1014
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,710
(Frightened)

1015
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:59,420
(She reacts as if he's a harmful insect.)

1016
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,250
(They get rid of him.)

1017
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,920
- You're under arrest. - Stop it.

1018
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,290
I'm an undercover officer.

1019
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,760
- I'm an undercover officer. - You're under arrest.

1020
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,430
Don't worry.

1021
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,200
We'll put him in prison.

1022
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,300
What do you mean?

1023
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,530
What did I do wrong?

1024
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,570
I feel sad too.

1025
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,240
(I feel sad too.)

1026
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,770
(He has feelings too.)

1027
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,510
I feel very sad.

1028
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,540
(Don't be biased.)

1029
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,940
Goodness.

1030
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,880
Kwang Soo is sad too.

1031
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,350
(Kwang Soo's cuteness fails.)

1032
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,910
We'll give you a hint.

1033
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,980
- You may not share it with others. - Really?

1034
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,350
- Do you keep it to yourself? - We can't share it?

1035
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,320
Team Police gets a hint about Team Boss.

1036
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,560
Team Boss gets a hint about the location of the money bag.

1037
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:49,770
(The hint about the money bag is 70. What does the number mean?)

1038
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,170
(He hopes that the police will trust him soon.)

1039
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,270
We don't know since we're just starting.

1040
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:58,010
- That's right. - Let's move to the next location.

1041
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,180
Let's go.

1042
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,910
(Let's get another hint from the next game.)

1043
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,620
It may be simpler than we think.

1044
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:09,120
(Team Police reads their two hints.)

1045
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,430
"The boss uses his or her real name."

1046
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,730
Real name?

1047
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:18,160
- Kwang Soo is his real name. - Right.

1048
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,530
Doesn't it only exclude Haha?

1049
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,830
It excludes Haha.

1050
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,300
It's also Ji Hyo.

1051
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,940
- Ji Hyo isn't her real name. - That's right.

1052
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,740
(Haha and Ji Hyo are excluded.)

1053
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,710
We can exclude Haha and Ji Hyo.

1054
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,240
- That's right. - Right.

1055
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:35,680
- They could probably be one of us. - Right, right.

1056
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,020
What's next?

1057
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,880
(What's the second hint?)

1058
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,720
"The boss has appeared in movies."

1059
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,790
- Who could it be? - How about Se Chan?

1060
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:46,360
I don't think he appeared in movies.

1061
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,390
What if he did?

1062
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,290
We'll be in trouble.

1063
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,700
(It's that simple.)

1064
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,670
He might be in movies that we don't know about.

1065
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,900
Who's the undercover officer?

1066
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,500
Isn't it Haha?

1067
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,470
- That's what I think. - He gave signals.

1068
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,770
It was excessive.

1069
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,440
Here's what I think.

1070
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,680
Others may feel unsettled if I say this.

1071
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,850
I think the boss is...

1072
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:12,220
(The most important identity, the boss, is...)

1073
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,550
Kwang Soo.

1074
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,220
- I think so too. - Really?

1075
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,360
(They think the boss is the undercover officer, Kwang Soo.)

1076
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,730
During the first mission,

1077
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:25,160
when I said that I was the undercover officer,

1078
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,530
Jae Seok said that he was also the undercover officer.

1079
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:28,930
Out of the blue,

1080
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,700
Kwang Soo mentioned something about being the boss.

1081
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:35,170
- Really? - He said one of us was the boss.

1082
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,980
He brought it up at an awkward timing.

1083
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,310
(Kwang Soo must be the boss.)

1084
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,450
Let's go.

1085
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,480
I'll win today no matter what.

1086
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,720
(Will they find the real boss?)

1087
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:52,090
(It's a swimming pool in Yangju, Gyeonggi Province,)

1088
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:56,490
(that awaits the villains and the police.)

1089
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,330
This mission is a team competition.

1090
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:01,370
A team competition?

1091
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:04,000
It's called Find the Three.

1092
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,140
- "Find the Three"? - Yes.

1093
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,010
One member from each team who gives...

1094
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:11,540
3 correct answers within 5 seconds wins.

1095
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,980
It's a five-second quiz competition.

1096
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,650
Two members from each team participate.

1097
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:20,150
One sits in a chair while the other answers the questions.

1098
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,150
If Team Police wins,

1099
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,690
The member in the chair is thrown into the water.

1100
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,360
He or she will be sent to Team Police.

1101
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:30,330
When there are five members on each team,

1102
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,960
both teams will move to the next location.

1103
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,370
(5 Team Police members ride the same car.)

1104
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,900
That's how the teams are divided.

1105
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,970
- I see. - This is important.

1106
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:39,700
- We should be strategic. - That's right.

1107
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,240
We should take those whom we think are the undercover officer.

1108
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,840
- True. - That's right.

1109
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,350
(It's me, Ha Neul and Seo Joon.)

1110
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,350
- That's right. - It'll be advantageous.

1111
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,720
(I'm the undercover officer.)

1112
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,920
(He looks around.)

1113
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,690
(I'm the real police.)

1114
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:59,460
(Is it really Haha?)

1115
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,530
Haha and Kwang Soo, stop sending them signals.

1116
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,300
- They keep sending signals. - Stop it.

1117
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,400
What are you doing?

1118
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,730
They'll recognize the truth.

1119
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:10,970
- Jae Seok. - Stop it.

1120
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:13,040
- They'll recognize the truth. - Stop.

1121
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:14,940
(You know who it is.)

1122
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,010
That's right.

1123
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,380
Haha, sit in the chair.

1124
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,680
- I'll sit first. - Ha Neul.

1125
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,250
- I'll go first. - I will.

1126
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,910
(It's Ha Neul versus Kwang Soo.)

1127
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:25,350
Ha Neul is up. Both of you have to sit at some point.

1128
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:29,590
(To recruit Haha, Ha Neul must win.)

1129
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:32,060
Last time when I was on Running Man,

1130
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,090
I was traumatized by quizzes with a time limit of few seconds.

1131
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,060
- It's difficult. - It is.

1132
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,770
The colors of a secondary rainbow are reversed.

1133
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:42,930
Say the rainbow colors in reverse within three seconds.

1134
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,740
- Wait. - 3, 2...

1135
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,170
- One. - Violet, indigo...

1136
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,380
(He fails.)

1137
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,980
Violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red.

1138
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,550
(He falls off.)

1139
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:59,050
(He has a painful memory of humiliation.)

1140
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,720
The answer has to make sense.

1141
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,490
It has to make some sense.

1142
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,660
- Are you ready? - Yes.

1143
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:08,130
Who are three female celebrities you've dated?

1144
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:12,960
Jun Ji Hyun.

1145
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:15,430
Jung Yu Mi and...

1146
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:18,940
- Gosh, I'm sorry. - Okay.

1147
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,840
(Kwang Soo wins with his smart question.)

1148
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,440
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

1149
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,610
(Splash)

1150
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:31,220
(The losing team member falls into the water automatically.)

1151
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,020
(That must feel refreshing.)

1152
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,360
You get thrown immediately.

1153
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,420
(It's rather humiliating.)

1154
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,690
Are you okay?

1155
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,530
Isn't it cold?

1156
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:42,660
(Haha stays with Team Boss.)

1157
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,200
Come to the front, Seo Joon.

1158
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,100
- Have a seat. - Please sit.

1159
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:48,630
Get ready.

1160
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,600
- Do I question him first? - 3 answers in 5 seconds.

1161
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:57,080
(Recruiting Ji Hyo is advantageous to Team Police.)

1162
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,140
Ask him a hard question.

1163
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,510
Who are the women who've visited your home?

1164
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,720
(He names three random women.)

1165
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,320
What did you say?

1166
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:09,220
(What has Kwang Soo done?)

1167
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,190
(Who is she?)

1168
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,460
May I do it again?

1169
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,260
What did you say?

1170
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,590
(He was blinded by his desire to win.)

1171
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:18,000
- May I do it again? - Are you okay?

1172
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:23,440
(Names of 3 female celebrities whom he's dated)

1173
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,170
(He names three women out of anger.)

1174
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:31,340
(He gave the same, exact names.)

1175
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,380
(Pretend that you didn't hear me.)

1176
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,380
What's wrong with him?

1177
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,950
- Come on. - He lost his mind.

1178
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:40,120
(Kwang Soo gives up, and Team Police recruits Ji Hyo.)

1179
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,520
She's recruited.

1180
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,690
She'll join your team,

1181
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,330
- so I did a good job. - They recruited Ji Hyo.

1182
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:52,160
(Team Police doesn't know that Ji Hyo is a villain.)

1183
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,530
(I wanted to recruit her.)

1184
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:54,830
- I wanted to recruit her. - Trust me.

1185
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:56,800
- That's true. - Do you want to try, So Min?

1186
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,470
Well...

1187
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,840
(I need to get recruited as well.)

1188
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:01,770
It's this team's turn to answer.

1189
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:02,940
- Is it? - Yes.

1190
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,410
- It's So Min's turn. - So Min, try.

1191
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,540
- Me? - Try.

1192
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,310
- Our magnetic girl. - Okay.

1193
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:08,780
- Our hero. - Our magnetic girl.

1194
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,950
Show him.

1195
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:11,480
All right.

1196
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,390
Seo Joon will sit there.

1197
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:15,350
- I'm the police. - You're not.

1198
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,260
Try.

1199
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,820
(Ji Hyo tells him what to ask.)

1200
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,590
- Try. - All right.

1201
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:25,000
Start.

1202
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,770
Give me three reasons why you like me.

1203
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:30,340
(Give me 3 reasons why you like me.)

1204
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:34,310
(Tell me why you like me in 5 seconds.)

1205
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:38,780
I just like you. Everything. Everything.

1206
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,710
- What's that? - That's not okay.

1207
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:43,310
This is not truth or dare.

1208
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,220
- That's not okay. - This is not truth or dare.

1209
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,450
(Reality hits.)

1210
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:49,590
What is she doing?

1211
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,390
Is she shooting a drama?

1212
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,860
(I'm sorry.)

1213
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:58,030
(I have somewhere to go.)

1214
00:45:58,030 --> 00:45:59,360
- Where are you going? - Where are you going?

1215
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,270
She's crazy.

1216
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:03,670
You said I could say anything.

1217
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,600
Still...

1218
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:09,210
(They'll play the game one more time.)

1219
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:11,940
"I just like you. Everything. Everything?"

1220
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,250
All right. Ha Neul will attack again.

1221
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,780
I can't look him in the face.

1222
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,980
I can't look him in the eye.

1223
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,920
You're so girly.

1224
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,090
Here we go.

1225
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:26,060
Tell me three of Kwang Soo's strengths.

1226
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,560
(That's an easy one.)

1227
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,200
He's tall, handsome, and cool.

1228
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,030
That was so hard.

1229
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,870
(He's tall, handsome, and cool.)

1230
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,410
(She had to lie for the game.)

1231
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:42,910
She just said whatever.

1232
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:44,080
(Look at you.)

1233
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,580
Kwang Soo is happy.

1234
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,110
Why do you look so happy?

1235
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:48,880
He's so ugly.

1236
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:50,250
I'll start.

1237
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,020
Give me three reasons why you don't like me.

1238
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:58,590
(That can't be too hard to answer.)

1239
00:46:58,590 --> 00:46:59,890
(Laughing)

1240
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:02,290
You're so pretty that I feel uncomfortable.

1241
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,400
And...

1242
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,830
Gosh.

1243
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,700
And...

1244
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:09,270
Is it that hard?

1245
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:11,040
I can't believe him.

1246
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,540
You just don't want me, do you?

1247
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:16,210
(Kwang Soo can't transfer to Team Police.)

1248
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:17,480
Hey!

1249
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,140
You can't win like this.

1250
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,480
- I'm the police! - Go back to your place.

1251
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:23,150
This is so frustrating.

1252
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:24,820
- I'm sorry. - I mean it.

1253
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:27,220
- Goodness. - I'm the undercover officer!

1254
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:29,220
Pull yourself together!

1255
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:30,860
I'm sorry!

1256
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:33,220
(Seo Joon goes into the water, and Kwang Soo stays on Team Boss.)

1257
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,790
- Why are you sorry? - Why?

1258
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:39,300
(Seo Joon gets to play in the water thanks to Running Man.)

1259
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,830
It's better for me to do it.

1260
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:43,170
Everyone stays.

1261
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:45,540
- Seok Jin, why don't you try? - Me?

1262
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,210
- Okay. - Seok Jin, try.

1263
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:48,440
- Seok Jin. - Okay.

1264
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,240
Here we go.

1265
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,710
- Let's do this. - Here we go.

1266
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,380
Who want to try?

1267
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:56,920
This is crazy.

1268
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,450
(Team Police has to pick a person to recruit.)

1269
00:47:58,450 --> 00:47:59,920
This is crazy.

1270
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,990
(Approaching)

1271
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:05,490
(Team Police should...)

1272
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:08,990
(Why is Haha doing that?)

1273
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:11,100
Jae Seok.

1274
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:13,530
Jae Seok.

1275
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:16,470
Stop it, Haha.

1276
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,400
We're a team.

1277
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,970
It's me.

1278
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:22,740
I'm staying quiet on purpose.

1279
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,780
- I mean it. - Seriously...

1280
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,850
He said he was being quiet.

1281
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:29,280
- My goodness. - I can't say three things.

1282
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:31,820
Okay.

1283
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,420
Give me three reasons why you don't like Ha Neul.

1284
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:36,220
He's handsome, pretty, and kind.

1285
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:37,860
- Then why do you not like him? - I just don't like him.

1286
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,490
Ji Hyo is so good at this game.

1287
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:42,060
Seok Jin.

1288
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,130
- Seok Jin looks so flustered. - Ji Hyo is so good at this game.

1289
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,630
It's too obvious.

1290
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:51,340
Give me three reasons why your marriage life is great.

1291
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:55,440
She is a good cook, wakes up late, and goes out often.

1292
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:59,440
She is a good cook, wakes up late, and goes out often.

1293
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:02,180
- She goes out often? - Where?

1294
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:03,380
Are they good things?

1295
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:05,520
- She's busy? - Are they good things?

1296
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,290
(Seok Jin spoke on behalf of all married men.)

1297
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:08,820
What are you doing?

1298
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,760
He just said whatever.

1299
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,990
I don't understand the game.

1300
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,160
He doesn't understand the game.

1301
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,930
What are your three charms?

1302
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,430
I'm pretty, kind, and sexy.

1303
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:22,170
Amazing.

1304
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:25,740
(I'm pretty, kind, and sexy.)

1305
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:27,310
- She's so good. - You're so shameless.

1306
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,610
She's so calm.

1307
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:31,080
(It's Ji Hyo's turn.)

1308
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,640
What are three lies you tell your wife?

1309
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:36,080
"I'll be home early."

1310
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,850
"The shooting is over."

1311
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:39,280
There are so many.

1312
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:42,390
- "I love you." - "The shooting is over."

1313
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:44,460
(There are too many to choose from.)

1314
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,860
- Am I going into the water? - Yes.

1315
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:51,460
(Jae Seok is transferred to Team Police.)

1316
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:54,070
We've already lost two.

1317
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:56,770
You look so ugly right now.

1318
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:59,670
- Don't fix your hair. - Okay.

1319
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,870
It's perfect now.

1320
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:04,580
It's perfect.

1321
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,210
Ji Hyo is too good.

1322
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:09,080
(What will happen to the undercover officer, Kwang Soo?)

1323
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,380
- Okay. - Seo Joon.

1324
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,050
- If So Min... - With So Min.

1325
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,280
So Min, try again.

1326
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,590
- Just confess your feelings. - Let's do it.

1327
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,920
It's So Min's lucky day today.

1328
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:25,100
(So Min can't look at Seo Joon.)

1329
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,670
Who will win?

1330
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:28,930
So Min.

1331
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:32,670
I don't understand why you're doing this.

1332
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:35,240
- I don't understand. - We're so confused.

1333
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,180
- She can't help it. - Which do you like better?

1334
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:38,940
It's 100 percent Seo Joon.

1335
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,650
Which do you like better?

1336
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:46,280
(Seo Joon can come off cold, but he is kind to me.)

1337
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:50,490
(Ha Neul always smiles to me.)

1338
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:54,390
(What am I supposed to do?)

1339
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:56,630
I don't understand why she's torn between the two.

1340
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:57,730
Neither do I.

1341
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,530
(The police and the villain are not meant to be together.)

1342
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:01,900
She's so happy.

1343
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,230
I understand her.

1344
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:04,700
- I understand her. - So Min.

1345
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,200
Kwang Soo must understand her.

1346
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,010
All right. Let's go.

1347
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:10,880
(The fifth round starts.)

1348
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,510
Tell me three guys you've kissed recently.

1349
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:14,910
- Say it. - Say it.

1350
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:18,120
(Tell me 3 guys you've kissed recently.)

1351
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:22,550
(She can say whatever names in 5 seconds.)

1352
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:24,620
- Say it. - Say it.

1353
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:27,060
- Say it. - Say it.

1354
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,130
(Flustered)

1355
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:31,800
I'll say people I like. Ahn Jae Hong, Won Bin...

1356
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,300
Why?

1357
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,770
My goodness.

1358
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:36,840
You could have just said whatever names.

1359
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,240
- You could have said our names. - Don't try to be girly.

1360
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,070
You're a magnetic girl.

1361
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:43,540
Pull yourself together.

1362
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,780
You could have said just any names.

1363
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:48,180
Why did you do that?

1364
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,780
(Seok Jin is transferred to Team Police.)

1365
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,450
We've played Find the Three.

1366
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,020
Ji Hyo, Jae Seok, and Seok Jin have been...

1367
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,250
transferred to Team Police.

1368
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,760
Kwang Soo, Se Chan, Jong Kook, and So Min are...

1369
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,630
Team Boss.

1370
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:03,160
- Let's move to another place. - Let's go.

1371
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,600
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1372
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,330
(They move to their next destination.)

1373
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:08,370
Ha Neul.

1374
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:10,040
(It's me.)

1375
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,400
This is so frustrating.

1376
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,840
(Haha can't stop pretending to be the police.)

1377
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:17,110
This is so frustrating.

1378
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:19,240
- Are you the police? - Yes.

1379
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,050
You'll see.

1380
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,380
- You'll see. - I'll show you.

1381
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,880
You should trust me, not him.

1382
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,350
I can't lie.

1383
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:30,220
Just watch me. I'll show you.

1384
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,420
- Watch me. - I'll show you.

1385
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,990
- I'll show you. - Kwang Soo.

1386
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:36,060
Kwang Soo, I'm sorry, but please be quiet.

1387
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,930
(Please let the police talk.)

1388
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,400
You shouldn't do this.

1389
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:43,840
Give me a chance.

1390
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,040
- Give me a chance. - Ha Neul.

1391
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:47,770
Watch me.

1392
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:49,510
(Will Kwang Soo win their trust?)

1393
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,240
Seo Joon, have you found any hints?

1394
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,480
Yes, I have.

1395
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,010
By the way,

1396
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,180
except us two,

1397
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:00,250
the others don't know who the boss is, right?

1398
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:03,050
- Do you know who it is? - I don't because I'm undercover.

1399
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:04,190
Can you...

1400
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:06,490
Can you guess who the undercover police is?

1401
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:07,960
Seo Joon, Ha Neul.

1402
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,360
I can't believe you guys.

1403
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,830
You think too much.

1404
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,600
(Tapping)

1405
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:17,740
(It's me.)

1406
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,540
- Are you the police? - Yes.

1407
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,370
Were you sending them signals?

1408
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:23,880
Gosh, you're so sly.

1409
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:25,910
- You're next to them, so... - I mean...

1410
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:28,250
I'm telling them because I am the police.

1411
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,720
Seok Jin, when did you find out you were the undercover officer?

1412
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,980
- When did I find out? - Yes.

1413
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,750
(Hesitating)

1414
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,160
(What is this awkward hesitation?)

1415
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,360
I'll tell you precisely.

1416
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:42,360
Right before the water game.

1417
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,400
- Right before the water game? - Yes.

1418
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,860
Right before the water game?

1419
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,030
They told us in the beginning.

1420
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:49,100
That's right. I forgot.

1421
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,470
After all those water splashes...

1422
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,970
- Water splashes? - You didn't get splashed.

1423
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,570
I got splashed with water.

1424
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:58,540
He might be acting.

1425
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,180
No. I'm not good at that.

1426
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,010
I'm so curious how it'll end.

1427
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:06,220
You don't have to be. I'll be with you.

1428
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:09,990
- Hey. - That sounded so fake.

1429
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:14,630
Gosh, Seo Joon, I can't believe you.

1430
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:18,060
It sounded fake?

1431
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,200
(Who will the police trust in the final race?)

1432
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:21,300
(Kwang Soo is surrounded by villains.)

1433
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,940
Mr. Lee, let's go.

1434
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:25,900
Don't do that in front of Jong Kook and Haha.

1435
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,640
I'm doing this because they are here.

1436
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,410
I don't want to keep talking.

1437
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:31,040
Please speak on behalf of me.

1438
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,210
Don't look back. Keep your eyes to the front.

1439
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,610
(Se Chan mimics Jong Kook.)

1440
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:36,880
Stop pretending.

1441
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,450
He didn't tell you to speak so rudely.

1442
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:39,650
- You didn't? - It's okay.

1443
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:41,620
You can speak rudely when you speak on behalf of me.

1444
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,690
- Gosh. - What?

1445
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:45,020
No, I was talking to So Min.

1446
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,360
- What? - You should...

1447
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,890
stop making things too obvious.

1448
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:49,260
It's too obvious.

1449
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,900
- What are you doing? - We're on different teams.

1450
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,060
We're being careful.

1451
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:54,470
Just because you're the police,

1452
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:56,030
do you think you can be so stuck-up?

1453
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:57,600
- Kwang Soo. - Is that what Jong Kook thinks?

1454
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,470
Hold on to the steering wheel. Look straight. We'll talk.

1455
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:02,610
Use both hands. Don't take them off.

1456
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:03,680
Right. Don't mess around.

1457
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,480
(So Min pitches in.)

1458
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,280
(What are you saying?)

1459
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,710
- That's what Jong Kook said. - That was out of nowhere.

1460
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:09,710
That's what Jong Kook is thinking.

1461
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:11,580
How do you know what he's thinking all of a sudden?

1462
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,280
They know exactly what I'm thinking.

1463
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:15,820
You're not just a villain in the fairytales.

1464
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,620
You're a thug.

1465
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,620
(You're a thug.)

1466
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,190
Jong Kook is?

1467
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,400
- Then our boss is... - It's Seok Jin.

1468
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,070
Is it advantageous for Seok Jin to be on the other team?

1469
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:28,970
Then our boss is...

1470
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:31,600
- It's Seok Jin. - Is it advantageous for him?

1471
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,670
(Did you just say...)

1472
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:36,140
(Seok Jin was the boss?)

1473
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:38,280
No, we're done if he gets caught.

1474
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,940
- We can't tell him. - We're done.

1475
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,580
- He doesn't know. - We can't tell him.

1476
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,480
(He doesn't know who the boss is.)

1477
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:55,273
(I get it. Seok Jin is the boss.)

1478
00:55:56,376 --> 00:55:57,506
We're in trouble.

1479
00:55:59,276 --> 00:56:00,706
(Nodding)

1480
00:56:03,176 --> 00:56:04,276
We're in trouble.

1481
00:56:04,546 --> 00:56:05,986
What? Here.

1482
00:56:08,216 --> 00:56:09,816
That was real.

1483
00:56:09,816 --> 00:56:10,886
(Kwang Soo is certain Seok Jin is the boss now.)

1484
00:56:10,886 --> 00:56:15,296
(Did the villains make a mistake, or was it intentional?)

1485
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:18,296
- Oh, dear. - Oh, dear.

1486
00:56:18,296 --> 00:56:19,296
What's this?

1487
00:56:19,296 --> 00:56:21,396
I think the chef...

1488
00:56:21,396 --> 00:56:22,836
boiled this for hours.

1489
00:56:22,836 --> 00:56:24,566
- This is unbelievable. - He softened it.

1490
00:56:24,566 --> 00:56:25,606
Look at the marinated crab.

1491
00:56:27,106 --> 00:56:30,176
(Se Chan, Ji Hyo, and Kwang Soo passed the restaurant mission.)

1492
00:56:30,176 --> 00:56:31,536
This rib melts in my mouth.

1493
00:56:31,536 --> 00:56:32,546
(Only they get to eat.)

1494
00:56:33,646 --> 00:56:34,906
(He forgets about the sorrow of being an undercover officer.)

1495
00:56:34,906 --> 00:56:36,116
Let me have some side dishes.

1496
00:56:36,116 --> 00:56:37,116
Don't ask.

1497
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:42,616
(The rest of them get rice, seaweed, and soy sauce marinated crab.)

1498
00:56:43,286 --> 00:56:44,686
(He's sick of eating seaweed.)

1499
00:56:44,686 --> 00:56:46,756
This crab is insane.

1500
00:56:47,556 --> 00:56:48,896
(He stands up.)

1501
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:50,826
Water.

1502
00:56:50,996 --> 00:56:51,996
I'm so hungry.

1503
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:55,836
It's been a while.

1504
00:56:55,836 --> 00:56:58,096
(It's been a while.)

1505
00:56:58,096 --> 00:56:59,636
Please let me pay my respects.

1506
00:57:00,106 --> 00:57:01,936
- Oh, dear. - Oh, dear.

1507
00:57:01,936 --> 00:57:03,006
(May you live long and be happy.)

1508
00:57:03,206 --> 00:57:04,206
Oh, dear.

1509
00:57:04,306 --> 00:57:06,346
I was eating,

1510
00:57:06,676 --> 00:57:10,146
and realized that it's been a while since I've paid my respects to you.

1511
00:57:11,716 --> 00:57:12,946
Give him that.

1512
00:57:12,946 --> 00:57:14,386
(He's thankful.)

1513
00:57:14,686 --> 00:57:16,586
(It's not a lot.)

1514
00:57:16,586 --> 00:57:17,586
Keep it.

1515
00:57:17,586 --> 00:57:19,926
(He gives him a seaweed.)

1516
00:57:19,926 --> 00:57:21,726
Please keep it.

1517
00:57:21,726 --> 00:57:22,826
We can't give you much.

1518
00:57:22,826 --> 00:57:25,926
(There's an anti-bribery act, so we can't give you much.)

1519
00:57:25,926 --> 00:57:27,796
(I'm happy I didn't try anything.)

1520
00:57:28,196 --> 00:57:29,696
- Do you want some of this? - There are seven vegetables.

1521
00:57:30,096 --> 00:57:31,966
- Wait, can I have some? - Okay.

1522
00:57:32,106 --> 00:57:33,806
- Can I whisper to you? - Whisper?

1523
00:57:37,206 --> 00:57:38,606
- I heard that. - Hold on.

1524
00:57:39,446 --> 00:57:40,676
- I heard that. - He...

1525
00:57:40,676 --> 00:57:43,776
(Kwang Soo is in shock.)

1526
00:57:43,776 --> 00:57:44,776
He called me a dog.

1527
00:57:44,776 --> 00:57:47,116
(Kwang Soo is in shock.)

1528
00:57:47,646 --> 00:57:48,886
You're mistaken.

1529
00:57:49,086 --> 00:57:50,356
I wouldn't say that.

1530
00:57:50,686 --> 00:57:52,226
He's very dear to me. That's not possible.

1531
00:57:52,486 --> 00:57:53,626
I wouldn't say that.

1532
00:57:53,626 --> 00:57:55,256
You heard it wrong.

1533
00:57:55,256 --> 00:57:56,726
- You... - I heard it wrong, right?

1534
00:57:56,726 --> 00:57:57,956
I can't believe him.

1535
00:57:58,796 --> 00:58:00,796
(I need to get some food.)

1536
00:58:01,166 --> 00:58:04,696
Then if you can lick your nose, I'll give you a piece of meat.

1537
00:58:04,696 --> 00:58:05,706
- Really? - Just one?

1538
00:58:05,706 --> 00:58:06,836
Yes, I'll give you a piece.

1539
00:58:06,836 --> 00:58:08,576
- I can do it. - Try it.

1540
00:58:10,306 --> 00:58:12,206
(She sticks her tongue out.)

1541
00:58:12,206 --> 00:58:13,646
It has to touch here.

1542
00:58:14,676 --> 00:58:18,116
(She tries diligently.)

1543
00:58:18,116 --> 00:58:19,286
(He finds it funny.)

1544
00:58:19,716 --> 00:58:21,746
You're touching the top of your upper lip.

1545
00:58:22,216 --> 00:58:23,286
- Kwang Soo. - It has to touch the tip.

1546
00:58:23,286 --> 00:58:24,356
Please give me one.

1547
00:58:24,616 --> 00:58:26,286
Your tongue has to touch the tip of your nose.

1548
00:58:27,226 --> 00:58:30,396
(Kwang Soo, please give me one.)

1549
00:58:30,396 --> 00:58:33,166
(He's a silly policeman.)

1550
00:58:33,296 --> 00:58:34,396
It has to touch the tip.

1551
00:58:34,396 --> 00:58:36,266
(He looks like a dork.)

1552
00:58:36,896 --> 00:58:38,396
(He succumbs to reality.)

1553
00:58:38,606 --> 00:58:40,336
He was hesitating.

1554
00:58:41,506 --> 00:58:42,736
Let's see, Ha Neul.

1555
00:58:42,736 --> 00:58:45,206
- Hello. Thank you. - Oh, dear.

1556
00:58:45,806 --> 00:58:47,276
- Please try it. - Can I have a rice cake?

1557
00:58:47,276 --> 00:58:48,816
One rice cake? I can do that.

1558
00:58:49,646 --> 00:58:50,916
- One rice cake? - That one's good.

1559
00:58:50,916 --> 00:58:51,916
The fish...

1560
00:58:51,916 --> 00:58:53,486
- Hello. - We're friends.

1561
00:58:53,546 --> 00:58:54,646
I'm Jang Moon Bok.

1562
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:56,716
It's me, it's me

1563
00:58:56,716 --> 00:58:59,186
- You can't do that. - It's me, it's me

1564
00:58:59,186 --> 00:59:01,286
(Moon Bok is back with seaweed on his hair.)

1565
00:59:01,286 --> 00:59:04,496
- It's me, it's me - I'll give you some.

1566
00:59:04,496 --> 00:59:06,426
(The rib belongs to me.)

1567
00:59:06,426 --> 00:59:08,536
- I'll give you a piece. - He deserves it.

1568
00:59:08,666 --> 00:59:09,836
I'm Jang Moon Bok.

1569
00:59:11,696 --> 00:59:13,906
(What's Haha working on now?)

1570
00:59:13,906 --> 00:59:16,406
(What is it?)

1571
00:59:17,306 --> 00:59:19,606
Everybody, whom do I look like?

1572
00:59:20,476 --> 00:59:21,816
- Kim Bo Sung. - Whom do I look like?

1573
00:59:21,816 --> 00:59:23,076
- Loyalty. - Loyalty.

1574
00:59:23,076 --> 00:59:24,716
Is it Park Sang Min?

1575
00:59:24,716 --> 00:59:25,716
No.

1576
00:59:26,386 --> 00:59:28,446
(It's neither Kim Bo Sung...)

1577
00:59:28,446 --> 00:59:29,916
(nor Park Sang Min.)

1578
00:59:29,916 --> 00:59:30,986
Then?

1579
00:59:30,986 --> 00:59:33,656
(Haha is impersonating...)

1580
00:59:33,656 --> 00:59:34,986
I'm Wolverine.

1581
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:36,696
Really?

1582
00:59:36,696 --> 00:59:37,996
(Haha is impersonating Wolverine?)

1583
00:59:37,996 --> 00:59:40,996
(Running Man: The Wolverine)

1584
00:59:41,836 --> 00:59:44,666
(That was an unexpected transformation.)

1585
00:59:44,666 --> 00:59:45,706
Haha.

1586
00:59:46,406 --> 00:59:47,406
Look.

1587
00:59:48,206 --> 00:59:51,376
(Viewers are impressed by his enthusiasm for the rib.)

1588
00:59:51,376 --> 00:59:53,606
He's a genius.

1589
00:59:53,606 --> 00:59:54,646
(He deserves two pieces of meat for that.)

1590
00:59:54,646 --> 00:59:56,176
- Haha. - That was amazing.

1591
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:57,176
He's a gem.

1592
00:59:57,416 --> 00:59:59,616
He's a genius.

1593
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:03,116
Three of you won earlier, so here are your hints.

1594
01:00:03,116 --> 01:00:04,116
- Yes. - Yes.

1595
01:00:04,216 --> 01:00:05,926
I got no hints today.

1596
01:00:05,986 --> 01:00:07,726
- I'm envious. - Me too.

1597
01:00:07,726 --> 01:00:10,396
If you're a villain, you'll get a hint about the money bag.

1598
01:00:10,626 --> 01:00:13,596
If you're an undercover officer, you'll get one about the boss.

1599
01:00:13,596 --> 01:00:14,926
(The boss' name has the letter "S" in it.)

1600
01:00:14,926 --> 01:00:17,296
I don't need this hint,

1601
01:00:17,296 --> 01:00:18,866
but it does confirm my suspicions.

1602
01:00:19,266 --> 01:00:21,906
If you have any idea, you'll know. Never mind.

1603
01:00:22,206 --> 01:00:24,306
I think he's the boss.

1604
01:00:24,306 --> 01:00:26,276
(The final race remains.)

1605
01:00:26,276 --> 01:00:28,916
(What will happen to the villains and the undercover officer?)

1606
01:00:29,116 --> 01:00:30,616
We don't have any other way.

1607
01:00:31,216 --> 01:00:33,646
- We have to frame Kwang Soo. - Okay.

1608
01:00:33,686 --> 01:00:34,716
That's our only way.

1609
01:00:34,716 --> 01:00:36,656
- Ha Neul... - We can frame him,

1610
01:00:36,656 --> 01:00:38,456
- but don't make it too obvious. - Right.

1611
01:00:38,456 --> 01:00:40,686
We're lucky because Ha Neul and Seo Joon...

1612
01:00:41,186 --> 01:00:42,726
- have no idea. - They have no clue.

1613
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:44,626
They're not even thinking about that person,

1614
01:00:44,626 --> 01:00:46,296
so they might try to eliminate that person first.

1615
01:00:46,296 --> 01:00:47,896
That won't do.

1616
01:00:47,896 --> 01:00:49,166
It'll end too early.

1617
01:00:49,166 --> 01:00:51,596
I'm kind of worried about people in the other car.

1618
01:00:51,596 --> 01:00:52,636
(The villains in the other car have a job to do.)

1619
01:00:54,236 --> 01:00:56,476
All right. We're going.

1620
01:00:56,476 --> 01:00:57,936
Villains, are you all here?

1621
01:00:57,936 --> 01:00:59,746
Yes, we're all here.

1622
01:01:00,146 --> 01:01:01,546
- There's police too. - I might be a villain...

1623
01:01:01,546 --> 01:01:02,816
or the police.

1624
01:01:02,816 --> 01:01:06,386
You two are very sharp.

1625
01:01:06,386 --> 01:01:08,916
- I agree. - The situation in this car...

1626
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:10,486
is very dramatic.

1627
01:01:10,586 --> 01:01:15,626
We think the undercover officer, the boss, and the villain are here.

1628
01:01:15,626 --> 01:01:19,466
(They think all of them are here.)

1629
01:01:19,996 --> 01:01:21,666
(They get goosebumps.)

1630
01:01:21,666 --> 01:01:23,966
However, we should keep our mouths shut.

1631
01:01:24,666 --> 01:01:26,006
That might be better for us.

1632
01:01:26,006 --> 01:01:29,206
We're just observing your talking.

1633
01:01:29,206 --> 01:01:30,776
I see.

1634
01:01:31,476 --> 01:01:35,576
We don't have to talk much. You can feel it in the atmosphere.

1635
01:01:35,816 --> 01:01:37,276
You'll know. It's a strange feeling.

1636
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:38,646
- We're all villains. - Kwang Soo.

1637
01:01:40,416 --> 01:01:44,256
(Why did he call Kwang Soo?)

1638
01:01:44,256 --> 01:01:45,686
I need to drive.

1639
01:01:45,686 --> 01:01:47,886
(Please be quiet.)

1640
01:01:48,286 --> 01:01:49,796
Okay, Seo Joon.

1641
01:01:49,896 --> 01:01:51,426
You won't do well if you do this.

1642
01:01:51,426 --> 01:01:52,796
(He's going crazy.)

1643
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:54,196
You won't do well.

1644
01:01:54,196 --> 01:01:55,796
Seo Joon, that was funny.

1645
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:57,436
(They all have fun except for Kwang Soo.)

1646
01:01:57,436 --> 01:01:59,436
He has to drive.

1647
01:01:59,606 --> 01:02:00,666
I see.

1648
01:02:01,366 --> 01:02:04,476
Do you remember way back?

1649
01:02:04,476 --> 01:02:07,006
(Way back when?)

1650
01:02:07,006 --> 01:02:09,446
(Remember what?)

1651
01:02:09,446 --> 01:02:10,446
We...

1652
01:02:11,816 --> 01:02:12,846
graduated...

1653
01:02:13,316 --> 01:02:14,686
from the police academy together.

1654
01:02:14,686 --> 01:02:18,686
(That was a good time.)

1655
01:02:18,686 --> 01:02:20,556
We were insane.

1656
01:02:20,786 --> 01:02:22,496
We threw eggs and flour at each other.

1657
01:02:22,496 --> 01:02:24,426
(What a great memory.)

1658
01:02:24,826 --> 01:02:26,796
My goodness.

1659
01:02:26,796 --> 01:02:27,996
Kang Ha Neul from class 103.

1660
01:02:27,996 --> 01:02:29,496
(Kwang Soo can't just watch.)

1661
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:31,596
Yes, sir. What class are you?

1662
01:02:31,596 --> 01:02:34,206
I'm from class 98.

1663
01:02:34,706 --> 01:02:38,136
There was a scandal within class 98.

1664
01:02:38,806 --> 01:02:40,746
A confidential document...

1665
01:02:40,746 --> 01:02:41,746
Do you remember that?

1666
01:02:41,746 --> 01:02:43,316
- I do. - Me too.

1667
01:02:43,316 --> 01:02:45,386
- It was class 98. - I remember.

1668
01:02:45,686 --> 01:02:46,916
You all remember.

1669
01:02:46,916 --> 01:02:48,856
It was class 98 for sure.

1670
01:02:49,286 --> 01:02:50,516
The policewomen...

1671
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:53,186
(She joins the conversation.)

1672
01:02:53,526 --> 01:02:54,986
(Even So Min knows about the incident.)

1673
01:02:54,986 --> 01:02:55,996
She's so funny.

1674
01:02:55,996 --> 01:02:57,996
We heard the rumor as well.

1675
01:02:58,296 --> 01:03:00,966
- Are you a policewoman? - Yes. It's very famous.

1676
01:03:02,296 --> 01:03:05,206
You know how we have two hints?

1677
01:03:05,206 --> 01:03:08,306
- Right. - They're very factual.

1678
01:03:08,306 --> 01:03:10,206
They're extremely factual.

1679
01:03:10,206 --> 01:03:12,576
- So I think we got it. - Please don't share them yet.

1680
01:03:12,576 --> 01:03:13,946
- Right. - We can't share them now.

1681
01:03:13,946 --> 01:03:16,016
- We can kind of infer. - Don't share.

1682
01:03:16,016 --> 01:03:17,946
- Make sure you don't share. - All right.

1683
01:03:18,376 --> 01:03:19,486
Do you remember that time?

1684
01:03:19,486 --> 01:03:21,646
(It's a different story.)

1685
01:03:22,756 --> 01:03:24,886
- In the dormitory, - That one.

1686
01:03:25,056 --> 01:03:27,686
Detective Park wanted to skip,

1687
01:03:27,686 --> 01:03:28,726
so we went outside!

1688
01:03:28,896 --> 01:03:29,996
We had...

1689
01:03:29,996 --> 01:03:31,626
- sausages that time. - We got caught.

1690
01:03:31,626 --> 01:03:33,826
Don't say that on television!

1691
01:03:33,826 --> 01:03:35,096
I know.

1692
01:03:35,166 --> 01:03:37,036
(Are they the alumni of a police academy?)

1693
01:03:37,366 --> 01:03:38,936
I remember that time.

1694
01:03:39,236 --> 01:03:40,466
We asked for sausages.

1695
01:03:40,466 --> 01:03:42,236
(He's happy to see his colleague.)

1696
01:03:43,476 --> 01:03:46,376
(Don't you realize that I'm the one?)

1697
01:03:49,876 --> 01:03:51,986
It's the final mission.

1698
01:03:52,446 --> 01:03:55,116
It's called Find the Boss.

1699
01:03:55,116 --> 01:03:58,456
(The final mission is Find the Boss.)

1700
01:03:58,456 --> 01:04:01,786
Mobile phones with R stickers are hidden in this place.

1701
01:04:02,026 --> 01:04:05,566
Team Boss will get hints regarding the money bag.

1702
01:04:05,666 --> 01:04:09,336
Team Police will get hints regarding the undercover officer.

1703
01:04:09,336 --> 01:04:10,566
Undercover officer?

1704
01:04:10,696 --> 01:04:14,706
During the race, two police officers excluding the undercover officer...

1705
01:04:15,236 --> 01:04:17,436
may tear off the name tags of Team Boss' members.

1706
01:04:17,806 --> 01:04:19,606
When the boss is eliminated, Team Police wins.

1707
01:04:19,776 --> 01:04:22,116
They also win an award of 1,000 dollars.

1708
01:04:23,476 --> 01:04:25,046
If they eliminate the undercover officer,

1709
01:04:25,046 --> 01:04:26,746
Team Police loses.

1710
01:04:27,316 --> 01:04:30,356
When the undercover officer is eliminated...

1711
01:04:30,656 --> 01:04:34,526
or the villains find the money bag and escapes with the boss...

1712
01:04:36,096 --> 01:04:38,326
(The villains must escape with the boss.)

1713
01:04:38,326 --> 01:04:40,466
Team Boss wins.

1714
01:04:41,166 --> 01:04:42,266
Undercover officer?

1715
01:04:48,236 --> 01:04:52,676
(Shouldn't the police stick together?)

1716
01:04:52,676 --> 01:04:54,346
Stop it, Kwang Soo.

1717
01:04:54,476 --> 01:04:56,546
- Stop it. - You startled me.

1718
01:04:57,216 --> 01:04:59,146
(Who is this gangling man in yellow?)

1719
01:04:59,146 --> 01:05:00,546
Gosh, you startled me.

1720
01:05:00,546 --> 01:05:02,656
- My body brought me here. - You startled me.

1721
01:05:02,656 --> 01:05:04,416
You frightened Seo Joon.

1722
01:05:04,416 --> 01:05:05,926
Why are you being so greedy?

1723
01:05:06,026 --> 01:05:08,696
- I did what my body told me to do. - You really scared me.

1724
01:05:09,926 --> 01:05:11,226
Kwang Soo is hopeless.

1725
01:05:11,226 --> 01:05:13,026
(He wants to stay away from him.)

1726
01:05:14,126 --> 01:05:15,466
(Sighing out of frustration)

1727
01:05:15,466 --> 01:05:17,796
When Team Police tears off a villain's name tag,

1728
01:05:18,136 --> 01:05:20,536
they earn a hint about the boss.

1729
01:05:20,536 --> 01:05:23,906
(Every villain's name tag gives a hint about the boss.)

1730
01:05:23,906 --> 01:05:28,616
(They must eliminate many villains to identify the boss.)

1731
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:31,646
Go to your places, and start the race.

1732
01:05:31,716 --> 01:05:33,186
- Are we on different floors? - Yes.

1733
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:34,946
- Really? - Let's go.

1734
01:05:35,256 --> 01:05:37,416
See you in the lobby.

1735
01:05:37,416 --> 01:05:38,486
We need to get the hints first.

1736
01:05:39,556 --> 01:05:41,026
On our way?

1737
01:05:41,026 --> 01:05:42,496
(What will be the final result?)

1738
01:05:43,696 --> 01:05:45,926
(They get ready for the final race.)

1739
01:05:46,896 --> 01:05:48,466
- What? - What should we do?

1740
01:05:48,466 --> 01:05:50,096
(Two policemen and Haha take the elevator.)

1741
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:55,106
Who do you think the boss is?

1742
01:05:55,336 --> 01:05:56,376
For now,

1743
01:05:56,676 --> 01:05:59,746
leave Kwang Soo alone until the last.

1744
01:06:00,446 --> 01:06:01,606
That's better.

1745
01:06:01,876 --> 01:06:03,516
I'm sure that it's Kwang Soo.

1746
01:06:03,516 --> 01:06:04,716
(He's suspicious of him.)

1747
01:06:04,716 --> 01:06:05,786
(Kwang Soo is the strongest candidate.)

1748
01:06:05,786 --> 01:06:06,916
He's a fool.

1749
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:10,056
This is frustrating.

1750
01:06:11,716 --> 01:06:16,556
Everyone seems to suspect that I'm the boss.

1751
01:06:18,256 --> 01:06:22,566
Why would I act like this if I'm not the undercover officer?

1752
01:06:24,066 --> 01:06:26,566
I know everything, and they don't need hints.

1753
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:28,836
All they have to do is believe me.

1754
01:06:28,836 --> 01:06:30,406
What's so difficult about that?

1755
01:06:30,406 --> 01:06:32,276
(Is it that difficult?)

1756
01:06:34,006 --> 01:06:36,216
Is it difficult to believe me?

1757
01:06:36,216 --> 01:06:39,286
(He shouldn't have lied so much in the past.)

1758
01:06:39,446 --> 01:06:41,416
(Undercover officer)

1759
01:06:41,416 --> 01:06:42,886
Does it say, "undercover officer"?

1760
01:06:43,686 --> 01:06:45,956
I'll show that justice prevails.

1761
01:06:46,886 --> 01:06:48,796
All police officers in Korea, stay strong.

1762
01:06:49,096 --> 01:06:50,256
Justice prevails.

1763
01:06:51,056 --> 01:06:52,096
Let's go.

1764
01:06:52,096 --> 01:06:53,996
(What will happen to Kwang Soo?)

1765
01:06:55,026 --> 01:06:58,866
We must make them eliminate Kwang Soo and end the game, okay?

1766
01:06:58,966 --> 01:07:02,676
I'll run as fast as possible if I see Ha Neul or Seo Joon.

1767
01:07:03,276 --> 01:07:05,546
First, I must find the hints.

1768
01:07:05,546 --> 01:07:06,576
(Her goal is to escape with the boss.)

1769
01:07:06,576 --> 01:07:08,046
I should stay with someone...

1770
01:07:08,716 --> 01:07:10,076
who's big and strong.

1771
01:07:10,546 --> 01:07:11,986
My goodness.

1772
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:13,816
(It's best to escape alone with the boss.)

1773
01:07:13,816 --> 01:07:15,486
Goodness.

1774
01:07:17,516 --> 01:07:21,786
(Team Police wins once they catch the boss.)

1775
01:07:21,786 --> 01:07:23,256
I'm so nervous.

1776
01:07:23,626 --> 01:07:24,796
I'm nervous.

1777
01:07:24,796 --> 01:07:26,466
(They can't eliminate the undercover officer.)

1778
01:07:26,466 --> 01:07:29,596
(Who is the real boss?)

1779
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:34,436
(3 police officers versus 7 villains)

1780
01:07:34,966 --> 01:07:37,436
The race will start now.

1781
01:07:37,436 --> 01:07:39,206
- It's being announced. - Five.

1782
01:07:40,276 --> 01:07:41,376
Four.

1783
01:07:41,706 --> 01:07:42,816
Three.

1784
01:07:43,146 --> 01:07:44,246
Two.

1785
01:07:44,716 --> 01:07:45,786
One.

1786
01:07:45,786 --> 01:07:47,316
- One. Let's go. - Start.

1787
01:07:47,316 --> 01:07:48,586
(The final race starts.)

1788
01:07:50,586 --> 01:07:52,056
I should search from here.

1789
01:07:52,056 --> 01:07:54,056
(Finding hints is the priority.)

1790
01:07:54,056 --> 01:07:55,456
I should search in there.

1791
01:07:55,456 --> 01:07:59,896
(Team Boss and Team Police get different hints.)

1792
01:08:01,666 --> 01:08:03,366
It's over once I see them.

1793
01:08:03,366 --> 01:08:04,496
(His priority is to see the police.)

1794
01:08:04,496 --> 01:08:05,906
I don't need to find hints.

1795
01:08:08,306 --> 01:08:09,676
Have you seen a phone?

1796
01:08:09,676 --> 01:08:11,706
(Have you seen a phone with an R sticker?)

1797
01:08:12,776 --> 01:08:14,576
Is it here?

1798
01:08:14,946 --> 01:08:16,146
Why did you give me that look?

1799
01:08:17,016 --> 01:08:18,116
Is it here?

1800
01:08:18,116 --> 01:08:19,286
(She has a hair roller in her hair.)

1801
01:08:20,816 --> 01:08:22,056
I'm embarrassed by my hair.

1802
01:08:22,586 --> 01:08:23,686
It's okay.

1803
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:27,456
Your hair will be edited on air.

1804
01:08:27,826 --> 01:08:29,026
Soon,

1805
01:08:29,156 --> 01:08:32,596
Seo Joon and Ha Neul will be walking about.

1806
01:08:33,496 --> 01:08:36,296
I hope you'll stay quieter.

1807
01:08:36,336 --> 01:08:39,436
Why did you remove the hair roller when I mentioned Seo Joon?

1808
01:08:40,666 --> 01:08:41,976
- Please go. - I will.

1809
01:08:42,506 --> 01:08:43,506
I'm leaving.

1810
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:45,206
They also treat me like dirt.

1811
01:08:46,576 --> 01:08:48,276
(Jae Seok searches the Running Man office.)

1812
01:08:48,276 --> 01:08:50,976
Why did they make it difficult to find it?

1813
01:08:58,756 --> 01:09:00,686
(He finds a phone.)

1814
01:09:00,686 --> 01:09:01,786
I found it.

1815
01:09:01,786 --> 01:09:03,296
- Let me look. - Be quiet.

1816
01:09:04,196 --> 01:09:06,296
- Let me look. - No.

1817
01:09:06,296 --> 01:09:07,426
(Seok Jin joins.)

1818
01:09:08,166 --> 01:09:11,806
(Call R man, and identify yourself to get a hint.)

1819
01:09:12,666 --> 01:09:14,906
(He calls immediately.)

1820
01:09:15,606 --> 01:09:16,806
This is R man.

1821
01:09:17,036 --> 01:09:19,106
I'm a villain.

1822
01:09:20,606 --> 01:09:24,546
The hint is 8065.

1823
01:09:24,546 --> 01:09:25,816
What does that mean?

1824
01:09:25,816 --> 01:09:28,286
(What is 8065?)

1825
01:09:28,286 --> 01:09:29,416
(How does it relate to the money bag?)

1826
01:09:29,416 --> 01:09:30,816
My goodness.

1827
01:09:31,716 --> 01:09:33,586
What could 8065 mean?

1828
01:09:35,556 --> 01:09:37,996
(On the other hand)

1829
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:42,936
(Seo Joon hums while searching.)

1830
01:09:43,066 --> 01:09:44,796
Where's the phone? What's this?

1831
01:09:46,406 --> 01:09:49,006
(Seo Joon also finds a phone.)

1832
01:09:49,006 --> 01:09:50,136
Wait.

1833
01:09:51,276 --> 01:09:52,776
"To get a hint,"

1834
01:09:52,776 --> 01:09:55,346
"call R man and identify yourself."

1835
01:09:57,146 --> 01:09:58,486
This is Police Park Seo Joon.

1836
01:09:58,486 --> 01:09:59,686
(Give me a hint.)

1837
01:09:59,686 --> 01:10:02,286
The undercover officer doesn't live with his parents.

1838
01:10:02,886 --> 01:10:03,986
Is that all?

1839
01:10:05,886 --> 01:10:13,766
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo live with their parents.)

1840
01:10:13,766 --> 01:10:14,926
Okay.

1841
01:10:17,936 --> 01:10:21,566
(Ji Hyo finds out about 8065.)

1842
01:10:21,566 --> 01:10:23,776
Does it work on the phone?

1843
01:10:23,876 --> 01:10:25,906
(Could this number be...)

1844
01:10:25,906 --> 01:10:27,146
Is it a word?

1845
01:10:27,146 --> 01:10:30,816
(Does it utilize the phone keyboard?)

1846
01:10:30,816 --> 01:10:33,816
This could make up a word.

1847
01:10:33,816 --> 01:10:36,256
(She compares it to the phone keyboard.)

1848
01:10:38,486 --> 01:10:41,926
We can eliminate either Jong Kook or Ji Hyo.

1849
01:10:42,056 --> 01:10:43,296
They're Ji Hyo and Jong Kook.

1850
01:10:44,226 --> 01:10:47,326
(Where are you, Jong Kook and Ji Hyo?)

1851
01:10:49,966 --> 01:10:54,336
(What? There's Ji Hyo.)

1852
01:10:54,336 --> 01:10:55,876
- Are you going to eliminate me? - What?

1853
01:10:56,476 --> 01:10:58,306
- We found you. - Can you give me more time?

1854
01:10:58,306 --> 01:10:59,406
- What's going on? - What are you doing?

1855
01:10:59,406 --> 01:11:01,406
I found a hint. Why are you approaching me?

1856
01:11:01,406 --> 01:11:03,246
- It's okay. - Hey.

1857
01:11:03,246 --> 01:11:04,846
- We won't eliminate you. - Listen.

1858
01:11:04,846 --> 01:11:06,116
What's the hint?

1859
01:11:06,716 --> 01:11:08,446
- Where did you find it? - Will you eliminate me?

1860
01:11:08,446 --> 01:11:10,656
I could be the undercover officer.

1861
01:11:11,356 --> 01:11:14,086
The undercover officer doesn't live with his parents.

1862
01:11:15,696 --> 01:11:18,766
(That means Ji Hyo is a villain.)

1863
01:11:19,926 --> 01:11:21,596
Wait a minute.

1864
01:11:21,596 --> 01:11:22,796
- Come on. - Tell us later.

1865
01:11:22,796 --> 01:11:24,466
- Goodness. - We're sorry.

1866
01:11:24,466 --> 01:11:25,636
We're sorry, Ji Hyo.

1867
01:11:26,466 --> 01:11:27,466
We're sorry.

1868
01:11:28,266 --> 01:11:30,036
- Come on. - Thank you.

1869
01:11:30,236 --> 01:11:31,536
Ji Hyo is out.

1870
01:11:31,876 --> 01:11:34,306
Ji Hyo is eliminated.

1871
01:11:34,306 --> 01:11:36,046
I'm a big fan of yours.

1872
01:11:36,046 --> 01:11:37,246
Get lost.

1873
01:11:37,416 --> 01:11:39,216
- Get lost, you two. - Thank you.

1874
01:11:39,216 --> 01:11:40,646
- Darn it. - Thank you.

1875
01:11:40,646 --> 01:11:43,316
- Thank you. - I was about to do something.

1876
01:11:43,516 --> 01:11:44,756
I said, get lost.

1877
01:11:46,426 --> 01:11:48,426
Here's a hint about the boss.

1878
01:11:48,726 --> 01:11:50,556
The boss isn't lucky.

1879
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:54,866
(The boss isn't lucky.)

1880
01:11:54,866 --> 01:11:56,096
He's not lucky?

1881
01:11:56,096 --> 01:11:59,106
(The boss isn't lucky?)

1882
01:11:59,566 --> 01:12:00,936
- I see. - Is that the hint?

1883
01:12:00,936 --> 01:12:03,706
- That means it's Kwang Soo. - It's Kwang Soo.

1884
01:12:03,706 --> 01:12:06,076
(The boss is Kwang Soo.)

1885
01:12:06,076 --> 01:12:08,106
- When we eliminate him is the key. - Right.

1886
01:12:08,106 --> 01:12:10,916
- Let's look for the undercover one. - You're right.

1887
01:12:10,976 --> 01:12:12,146
We'll leave him last.

1888
01:12:12,146 --> 01:12:13,486
There are other unlucky members.

1889
01:12:13,486 --> 01:12:14,686
It's Kwang Soo.

1890
01:12:14,686 --> 01:12:15,956
(They're convinced.)

1891
01:12:19,086 --> 01:12:21,086
(You're right. I'm unlucky.)

1892
01:12:22,256 --> 01:12:24,826
Have you seen Ha Neul and Seo Joon?

1893
01:12:25,226 --> 01:12:26,426
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1894
01:12:26,826 --> 01:12:28,696
Let's stay together.

1895
01:12:28,696 --> 01:12:29,836
For what?

1896
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:31,936
What would I do with a villain?

1897
01:12:31,936 --> 01:12:34,236
Let me tell you this.

1898
01:12:34,236 --> 01:12:35,276
I am...

1899
01:12:35,736 --> 01:12:38,106
May I tell this to him?

1900
01:12:38,106 --> 01:12:40,646
(It's top secret information.)

1901
01:12:42,746 --> 01:12:43,816
I am...

1902
01:12:43,816 --> 01:12:46,216
(Actually, I am...)

1903
01:12:46,216 --> 01:12:47,616
I'm the head of the police.

1904
01:12:47,616 --> 01:12:53,086
(I'm the head of the police.)

1905
01:12:53,086 --> 01:12:55,656
(Laughing)

1906
01:12:55,656 --> 01:12:57,896
(What do you take me for?)

1907
01:12:59,026 --> 01:13:00,396
What's wrong?

1908
01:13:00,496 --> 01:13:04,166
Sometimes, you treat me like a complete fool.

1909
01:13:04,166 --> 01:13:06,436
- I don't like it. - Kwang Soo, I'm serious.

1910
01:13:07,136 --> 01:13:08,806
- You're the head of the police? - You're the undercover officer.

1911
01:13:08,806 --> 01:13:10,336
Do you want to be handcuffed?

1912
01:13:10,836 --> 01:13:13,876
Come on, follow me. Seriously.

1913
01:13:14,146 --> 01:13:17,016
Stop talking nonsense. I don't like it at all.

1914
01:13:17,216 --> 01:13:19,946
Saying that you're the head of the police isn't convincing.

1915
01:13:21,486 --> 01:13:23,916
(They search for Jong Kook.)

1916
01:13:24,886 --> 01:13:26,256
- Hello. - Hello.

1917
01:13:26,256 --> 01:13:28,256
(There you are, Jong Kook.)

1918
01:13:28,626 --> 01:13:30,896
- Did you get any hints? - Yes.

1919
01:13:30,926 --> 01:13:32,266
What have you found?

1920
01:13:32,266 --> 01:13:33,726
We're watching you all.

1921
01:13:33,726 --> 01:13:35,396
How far are you? How many hints?

1922
01:13:35,396 --> 01:13:37,466
- We have many. - You do?

1923
01:13:37,466 --> 01:13:41,876
- We know whom to eliminate. - You do?

1924
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:43,306
- You do? - Yes.

1925
01:13:44,436 --> 01:13:48,446
(I see. Am I in that list?)

1926
01:13:48,876 --> 01:13:51,076
- I see. - That's it.

1927
01:13:51,076 --> 01:13:52,286
- You have an idea. - Yes.

1928
01:13:52,286 --> 01:13:54,486
- You know whom to eliminate. - We have an idea.

1929
01:13:54,486 --> 01:13:56,356
I see. It's hot today.

1930
01:13:58,216 --> 01:14:00,586
- Please take some time off. - Please.

1931
01:14:00,956 --> 01:14:02,526
Would you like to take a break?

1932
01:14:02,996 --> 01:14:05,696
Sure. It's quite a hot day.

1933
01:14:06,326 --> 01:14:08,296
It's hot.

1934
01:14:08,296 --> 01:14:10,196
- All right. - Thank you.

1935
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:11,766
- Thank you. - All right.

1936
01:14:11,766 --> 01:14:12,836
(They thank him,)

1937
01:14:12,836 --> 01:14:15,036
(and eliminate him.)

1938
01:14:16,836 --> 01:14:19,046
- Oh, dear. - You figured it out.

1939
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:21,106
You have a good idea.

1940
01:14:21,306 --> 01:14:22,946
- We got him. - I wasted my time.

1941
01:14:22,946 --> 01:14:24,416
You got me.

1942
01:14:24,416 --> 01:14:25,686
- He's a villain. - Right.

1943
01:14:26,446 --> 01:14:28,756
Ji Hyo and Jong Kook are out.

1944
01:14:28,886 --> 01:14:32,126
Here's a hint about the boss. It's a male.

1945
01:14:33,086 --> 01:14:35,196
- Did you see Seo Joon and Ha Neul? - I haven't.

1946
01:14:35,396 --> 01:14:36,956
- Where did they go? - Hey.

1947
01:14:37,656 --> 01:14:39,166
Why are you looking for them?

1948
01:14:39,166 --> 01:14:41,096
I'm a policeman.

1949
01:14:41,266 --> 01:14:42,936
- You're not. - You...

1950
01:14:42,936 --> 01:14:44,766
- Rip my name tag. - Let me ask you a question.

1951
01:14:44,766 --> 01:14:46,106
I'm an officer that can't rip name tags.

1952
01:14:46,106 --> 01:14:47,936
You can't rip them?

1953
01:14:48,166 --> 01:14:50,036
Rip mine.

1954
01:14:50,036 --> 01:14:51,206
- Gosh. - Rip it.

1955
01:14:51,206 --> 01:14:52,706
Line up. Rip all of ours.

1956
01:14:52,706 --> 01:14:54,846
- I can't rip them. - If you're a cop, rip it.

1957
01:14:54,846 --> 01:14:59,346
I can't because I'm an undercover officer.

1958
01:15:00,186 --> 01:15:01,646
- Let's talk on our own. - Let's talk.

1959
01:15:01,816 --> 01:15:03,386
Our hints...

1960
01:15:06,126 --> 01:15:07,186
Am I...

1961
01:15:07,726 --> 01:15:09,456
the ugly duckling?

1962
01:15:10,056 --> 01:15:11,356
Where did they go?

1963
01:15:12,396 --> 01:15:13,926
Boss, why are you following us?

1964
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:16,766
- Boss, why do you keep following? - Why are you following us?

1965
01:15:17,336 --> 01:15:21,366
You'll get caught by the police. Hide.

1966
01:15:21,366 --> 01:15:24,236
- Hide, boss. - Hey, boss. Hide.

1967
01:15:25,036 --> 01:15:26,846
No. Come on.

1968
01:15:28,176 --> 01:15:29,246
What's this?

1969
01:15:31,416 --> 01:15:33,116
It's for you. Open it when you're alone.

1970
01:15:33,546 --> 01:15:36,416
Kwang Soo, go to the corner.

1971
01:15:36,686 --> 01:15:38,316
Trust me, Kwang Soo.

1972
01:15:39,456 --> 01:15:40,486
What's this?

1973
01:15:40,486 --> 01:15:45,866
(What did Se Chan give him?)

1974
01:15:47,796 --> 01:15:51,496
(You're stupid.)

1975
01:15:51,496 --> 01:15:54,766
(What? Stupid?)

1976
01:15:55,576 --> 01:15:57,136
I have to end this. This won't do.

1977
01:15:57,136 --> 01:15:58,336
(I'll show you what I've got.)

1978
01:15:59,476 --> 01:16:02,616
(Meanwhile, the 13th floor is quiet.)

1979
01:16:02,616 --> 01:16:06,616
(He's on full alert.)

1980
01:16:08,086 --> 01:16:09,186
That startled me.

1981
01:16:09,716 --> 01:16:12,926
(Villain Yu is looking for additional hints.)

1982
01:16:18,766 --> 01:16:22,666
(He finds another hint.)

1983
01:16:22,666 --> 01:16:23,896
I'm a villain.

1984
01:16:26,106 --> 01:16:28,806
Your hint is "70H".

1985
01:16:29,636 --> 01:16:30,776
"70H"?

1986
01:16:30,776 --> 01:16:34,076
(That's...)

1987
01:16:35,376 --> 01:16:38,946
(It's "70H 8065".)

1988
01:16:40,686 --> 01:16:42,016
It's a license plate.

1989
01:16:43,016 --> 01:16:48,626
(All the hints point to a parking lot.)

1990
01:16:48,926 --> 01:16:54,226
(He has to find "70H 8065" at the parking lot.)

1991
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:56,636
(He looks around.)

1992
01:17:03,306 --> 01:17:05,146
Turn the light off.

1993
01:17:05,546 --> 01:17:09,846
(He finds the car.)

1994
01:17:09,846 --> 01:17:10,846
(Clicking)

1995
01:17:10,846 --> 01:17:11,846
Turn it off.

1996
01:17:16,756 --> 01:17:17,856
There's no key.

1997
01:17:19,186 --> 01:17:20,686
Do I have to find a key?

1998
01:17:20,956 --> 01:17:22,196
My goodness.

1999
01:17:22,756 --> 01:17:23,896
Gosh.

2000
01:17:24,096 --> 01:17:25,326
I found the car though.

2001
01:17:26,496 --> 01:17:28,396
Se Chan? No, I think...

2002
01:17:29,236 --> 01:17:30,766
- I don't think so. - Haha...

2003
01:17:30,766 --> 01:17:32,436
- seems like an undercover officer. - I think so too.

2004
01:17:32,436 --> 01:17:35,506
He's the most likely from all the guys.

2005
01:17:36,636 --> 01:17:38,806
Haha wanted to meet at the lobby, right?

2006
01:17:40,076 --> 01:17:41,146
Ha Neul.

2007
01:17:41,146 --> 01:17:42,146
(Haha is at the lobby.)

2008
01:17:42,146 --> 01:17:43,216
Seo Joon?

2009
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:45,616
(Where did they go?)

2010
01:17:48,446 --> 01:17:51,616
(What's this?)

2011
01:17:58,026 --> 01:18:01,266
(He finds a phone.)

2012
01:18:01,566 --> 01:18:04,896
(He hides, and tries to contact the R man.)

2013
01:18:04,896 --> 01:18:06,566
I'm Villain Haha.

2014
01:18:07,536 --> 01:18:08,636
Yes.

2015
01:18:08,636 --> 01:18:11,236
Your hint is "70H".

2016
01:18:12,676 --> 01:18:14,876
- "70H"? - Yes.

2017
01:18:14,876 --> 01:18:16,546
That's a 7, 0, and H?

2018
01:18:17,046 --> 01:18:18,446
It's a license plate.

2019
01:18:21,616 --> 01:18:24,216
I got so many hints today. That's not usual.

2020
01:18:24,786 --> 01:18:26,056
That's so fascinating.

2021
01:18:26,256 --> 01:18:28,026
It's such a delightful feeling.

2022
01:18:30,496 --> 01:18:31,966
I have to go to the first floor.

2023
01:18:35,266 --> 01:18:36,466
It's so hot.

2024
01:18:36,466 --> 01:18:38,566
(The police are on the 1st floor.)

2025
01:18:38,566 --> 01:18:40,136
There's nobody here.

2026
01:18:41,036 --> 01:18:42,906
I hope I can get another hint.

2027
01:18:42,906 --> 01:18:47,546
(So Min is coming down,)

2028
01:18:47,546 --> 01:18:50,246
(and the police are on the 1st floor.)

2029
01:18:50,246 --> 01:18:52,046
The boss is a guy.

2030
01:18:53,186 --> 01:18:54,486
They'll trust me.

2031
01:18:54,486 --> 01:18:57,556
(That was the hint from earlier.)

2032
01:18:57,556 --> 01:18:58,656
Hello.

2033
01:18:58,656 --> 01:18:59,726
(She has no fear.)

2034
01:19:00,686 --> 01:19:01,756
Hello.

2035
01:19:01,756 --> 01:19:03,296
(It's So Min.)

2036
01:19:03,396 --> 01:19:04,996
- Did you find something? - What's going on?

2037
01:19:04,996 --> 01:19:07,126
- There's nothing. I was looking. - There's nothing?

2038
01:19:07,426 --> 01:19:08,896
- Have you eliminated anyone? - Help us then.

2039
01:19:08,896 --> 01:19:10,566
How? What should I do?

2040
01:19:10,566 --> 01:19:12,166
Please join us...

2041
01:19:12,166 --> 01:19:14,106
- I just saw... - It's Kwang Soo.

2042
01:19:14,106 --> 01:19:15,136
It's Kwang Soo.

2043
01:19:15,536 --> 01:19:17,506
Who is that? Seo Joon.

2044
01:19:18,406 --> 01:19:19,576
Listen to me.

2045
01:19:20,076 --> 01:19:21,876
Wait, listen to me.

2046
01:19:21,876 --> 01:19:23,876
You don't think it's me, right? Listen to me.

2047
01:19:27,186 --> 01:19:28,346
(Ripping)

2048
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:30,286
- That's right. - Hey.

2049
01:19:30,286 --> 01:19:32,586
(Why did Ha Neul rip So Min's name tag?)

2050
01:19:32,586 --> 01:19:33,926
What is she?

2051
01:19:33,926 --> 01:19:36,126
She's a villain. We got her.

2052
01:19:36,326 --> 01:19:37,396
Go there.

2053
01:19:37,396 --> 01:19:40,066
(5 minutes ago)

2054
01:19:40,066 --> 01:19:41,836
- There's one. - There is?

2055
01:19:43,436 --> 01:19:44,496
I got it.

2056
01:19:44,496 --> 01:19:46,406
The undercover officer is a male.

2057
01:19:46,406 --> 01:19:48,606
A male. "The undercover officer is a male."

2058
01:19:48,806 --> 01:19:51,436
- Yes. - I thought it was So Min.

2059
01:19:51,776 --> 01:19:53,346
- It's not. - That's right.

2060
01:19:53,346 --> 01:19:54,746
(So Min is not the undercover officer.)

2061
01:19:55,846 --> 01:19:58,746
(They knew it wasn't So Min.)

2062
01:19:58,746 --> 01:20:00,086
That was unexpected.

2063
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:01,346
What is she?

2064
01:20:01,346 --> 01:20:03,716
She's a villain. We got her.

2065
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:06,056
She's a villain.

2066
01:20:06,256 --> 01:20:07,826
We're good.

2067
01:20:08,796 --> 01:20:10,826
If they rip Kwang Soo, it's over.

2068
01:20:10,856 --> 01:20:12,466
(She is sad.)

2069
01:20:13,526 --> 01:20:14,966
The boss...

2070
01:20:14,966 --> 01:20:16,866
is Seok Jin. It's Seok Jin.

2071
01:20:16,866 --> 01:20:18,236
Did you find any hints?

2072
01:20:18,396 --> 01:20:20,166
- I didn't need to. - Why not?

2073
01:20:20,266 --> 01:20:21,406
I'm the undercover officer.

2074
01:20:21,406 --> 01:20:24,936
Villain So Min is out, so here's a hint about the boss.

2075
01:20:25,706 --> 01:20:29,946
(I'll prove my identity with this hint about the boss.)

2076
01:20:33,546 --> 01:20:35,686
The boss is a coward.

2077
01:20:35,686 --> 01:20:38,386
(The boss is a coward.)

2078
01:20:38,386 --> 01:20:39,586
It's not me.

2079
01:20:40,226 --> 01:20:43,426
(He's a coward?)

2080
01:20:43,426 --> 01:20:45,466
- What kind of a hint is that? - What was that?

2081
01:20:45,466 --> 01:20:46,866
- "The boss is..." - It's not me.

2082
01:20:47,026 --> 01:20:48,796
- "a coward." - Seok Jin is the boss.

2083
01:20:49,096 --> 01:20:50,366
I'm certain. It's Seok Jin.

2084
01:20:50,366 --> 01:20:51,736
- Trust me. - I didn't look for any hints.

2085
01:20:51,736 --> 01:20:54,136
- Seo Joon, this is urgent. - All day, I was looking for you.

2086
01:20:54,136 --> 01:20:56,376
You won't bump into us. You don't have many chances.

2087
01:20:56,376 --> 01:20:57,606
Jae Seok found something.

2088
01:20:57,606 --> 01:20:59,406
- Where's the bag? - He found something.

2089
01:20:59,576 --> 01:21:00,646
Here.

2090
01:21:00,646 --> 01:21:02,076
- Not that bag. - The money bag?

2091
01:21:02,076 --> 01:21:03,376
How do I know?

2092
01:21:03,376 --> 01:21:04,376
Look at my eyes.

2093
01:21:04,376 --> 01:21:06,416
I'm the undercover officer. If you get me out, this is over.

2094
01:21:06,516 --> 01:21:07,986
- You think I'm the boss? - I swear.

2095
01:21:08,046 --> 01:21:09,656
Why do you think it's me?

2096
01:21:09,656 --> 01:21:11,556
Why should I give you information about the boss?

2097
01:21:11,556 --> 01:21:14,426
- Why did I do that? - Kwang Soo.

2098
01:21:14,426 --> 01:21:16,596
Look, I'll even let you rip my name tag.

2099
01:21:16,596 --> 01:21:18,126
- All day, - I'm an undercover officer.

2100
01:21:18,126 --> 01:21:20,726
I've been criticized by both sides.

2101
01:21:21,226 --> 01:21:23,396
Let's go together. I'll help you. I can help you.

2102
01:21:24,266 --> 01:21:25,406
- Let's go. - Hey.

2103
01:21:25,406 --> 01:21:27,606
You can't let him go. He'll run away.

2104
01:21:27,666 --> 01:21:29,306
Let's go up. Seok Jin is upstairs.

2105
01:21:29,306 --> 01:21:30,676
Kwang Soo, don't go by yourself.

2106
01:21:31,036 --> 01:21:32,546
- Where are you going? - Excuse me.

2107
01:21:32,746 --> 01:21:34,176
- Excuse me. - Press the button. We have no time.

2108
01:21:34,176 --> 01:21:36,416
- Don't move your hand. - Let's go up.

2109
01:21:36,716 --> 01:21:38,076
Watch him.

2110
01:21:38,076 --> 01:21:40,886
Don't treat me like a criminal. I'm not that kind of a person.

2111
01:21:41,416 --> 01:21:43,256
Let's separate and rip everybody's name tags.

2112
01:21:43,586 --> 01:21:44,956
It's awesome if you get Seok Jin.

2113
01:21:44,956 --> 01:21:47,186
Should I stay with Kwang Soo, or do you want to?

2114
01:21:47,426 --> 01:21:48,856
I can go around and then we can switch.

2115
01:21:48,856 --> 01:21:51,696
Don't make it sound like you're watching me. I'm a cop too.

2116
01:21:51,866 --> 01:21:53,326
Is there a lock?

2117
01:21:53,466 --> 01:21:55,236
Why do you need a lock?

2118
01:21:55,236 --> 01:21:57,066
- We're a team. - I know.

2119
01:21:57,066 --> 01:21:59,206
Isn't there a jail here?

2120
01:21:59,636 --> 01:22:01,766
Why would a cop be jailed?

2121
01:22:01,766 --> 01:22:02,936
(I'm the undercover officer, guys.)

2122
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:06,446
(This is the jail on the 1st floor.)

2123
01:22:06,446 --> 01:22:08,246
I was coming this way,

2124
01:22:09,076 --> 01:22:11,616
then Ha Neul followed me.

2125
01:22:13,746 --> 01:22:15,256
My heart fluttered.

2126
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:20,586
(So Min was on her way to the jail after she got eliminated.)

2127
01:22:20,586 --> 01:22:23,696
(He went after her.)

2128
01:22:24,526 --> 01:22:27,896
(Ha Neul made her heart flutter.)

2129
01:22:27,896 --> 01:22:30,296
I didn't want to show him, but he grabbed my wrists,

2130
01:22:30,296 --> 01:22:32,506
and flipped them over. My heart fluttered again.

2131
01:22:33,766 --> 01:22:35,436
It's nothing.

2132
01:22:35,476 --> 01:22:41,076
(He stole her heart with his strong grip.)

2133
01:22:42,216 --> 01:22:44,516
So Min falls in love easily.

2134
01:22:45,216 --> 01:22:47,686
She's the second one. She's like Kwang Soo.

2135
01:22:47,686 --> 01:22:50,116
She's the female Kwang Soo. She seems like one.

2136
01:22:50,116 --> 01:22:52,656
(So Min is silly like Kwang Soo, and falls in love easily too.)

2137
01:22:52,856 --> 01:22:54,826
- Then you can... - We have no time.

2138
01:22:54,826 --> 01:22:56,156
watch him.

2139
01:22:56,226 --> 01:23:00,126
Seok Jin is hiding because he doesn't want to be out.

2140
01:23:00,196 --> 01:23:01,596
- You haven't seen him today, right? - No.

2141
01:23:01,596 --> 01:23:03,866
I saw him on the upper floors. I think it was the 13th floor.

2142
01:23:03,866 --> 01:23:06,066
- 14th floor? - If you see him, rip his name tag.

2143
01:23:06,066 --> 01:23:07,606
- There's no time. - I'll do the 14th floor.

2144
01:23:07,606 --> 01:23:10,036
- Jae Seok is on the 4th floor. - Good luck.

2145
01:23:10,036 --> 01:23:13,446
(If Kwang Soo is right, they have to find Seok Jin.)

2146
01:23:15,476 --> 01:23:16,746
Seok Jin.

2147
01:23:18,586 --> 01:23:20,046
- Jae Seok. - Yes.

2148
01:23:20,116 --> 01:23:23,116
- Did you find anything? - Well...

2149
01:23:23,116 --> 01:23:25,756
- The police are too close. - Right?

2150
01:23:25,756 --> 01:23:27,486
- You know, right? Be careful. - I know.

2151
01:23:27,486 --> 01:23:29,226
- Hold on. - I have to be careful.

2152
01:23:29,226 --> 01:23:32,196
- I know where the car is. - Okay.

2153
01:23:32,296 --> 01:23:34,026
- I do too. - Which floor are you on?

2154
01:23:34,026 --> 01:23:36,366
This is the 13th floor, right? I am on the 13th floor.

2155
01:23:36,366 --> 01:23:37,566
Be careful.

2156
01:23:37,566 --> 01:23:38,766
I know. I'm hiding.

2157
01:23:38,766 --> 01:23:40,466
I need to find the car key.

2158
01:23:40,466 --> 01:23:41,936
Find it quickly, and call me.

2159
01:23:41,936 --> 01:23:42,936
Okay.

2160
01:23:43,136 --> 01:23:45,676
(Why is Jae Seok sharing information with Seok Jin?)

2161
01:23:45,876 --> 01:23:46,876
Okay.

2162
01:23:47,306 --> 01:23:48,446
He told me to be careful.

2163
01:23:49,576 --> 01:23:52,486
Jae Seok cares about me. He told me to hide.

2164
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:55,786
(Jae Seok cares about me. He told me to hide.)

2165
01:23:55,786 --> 01:23:57,886
I will leave with the last one standing.

2166
01:23:57,886 --> 01:23:58,986
(What does he mean?)

2167
01:23:58,986 --> 01:24:00,856
I wouldn't mind if more people get eliminated.

2168
01:24:01,926 --> 01:24:04,556
(Is he planning to leave...)

2169
01:24:04,556 --> 01:24:07,766
(with the last one standing?)

2170
01:24:08,366 --> 01:24:10,166
Your boss of the day is...

2171
01:24:10,396 --> 01:24:12,666
Seok Jin.

2172
01:24:12,666 --> 01:24:14,636
(It's hard to believe but true.)

2173
01:24:14,636 --> 01:24:16,206
No way!

2174
01:24:16,536 --> 01:24:19,006
- Are you sure about it? - Look forward to a difficult day.

2175
01:24:19,006 --> 01:24:21,776
10 minutes into the game, he will go,

2176
01:24:21,776 --> 01:24:23,976
"Do you know who I am?"

2177
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:24,976
(He wasn't reliable.)

2178
01:24:27,046 --> 01:24:35,026
(The villains called Seok Jin the boss in the car.)

2179
01:24:35,026 --> 01:24:42,636
(It was a big accident.)

2180
01:24:43,496 --> 01:24:45,066
The boss doesn't go into the war zone.

2181
01:24:46,006 --> 01:24:47,406
The boss sits behind the desk,

2182
01:24:48,136 --> 01:24:49,936
and reaps the benefits.

2183
01:24:50,576 --> 01:24:52,846
(Villains, hurry up, and find the car key.)

2184
01:24:54,246 --> 01:24:56,076
I think this is the editing room for Running Man.

2185
01:24:56,076 --> 01:24:57,576
(He must find the car key before the boss gets apprehended.)

2186
01:24:57,576 --> 01:24:58,786
Maybe it's here.

2187
01:24:58,786 --> 01:25:00,646
(He must find the car key before the boss gets apprehended.)

2188
01:25:01,546 --> 01:25:03,186
(Rummaging)

2189
01:25:07,056 --> 01:25:09,656
(He finds a phone.)

2190
01:25:09,656 --> 01:25:12,126
I am a villain. Where is the car key?

2191
01:25:12,126 --> 01:25:14,196
The hint is 18th floor.

2192
01:25:14,196 --> 01:25:15,466
Okay.

2193
01:25:16,736 --> 01:25:18,366
It must be on the 18th floor.

2194
01:25:18,366 --> 01:25:21,166
(Team Boss' goal is to find the car key on the 18th floor.)

2195
01:25:21,566 --> 01:25:23,476
Let's find them. I won't run away.

2196
01:25:23,476 --> 01:25:24,576
Okay.

2197
01:25:25,306 --> 01:25:27,446
We found the car. We just need to find the car key.

2198
01:25:29,746 --> 01:25:33,946
(Team Boss arrives on the 18th floor.)

2199
01:25:33,946 --> 01:25:36,586
(Where is it?)

2200
01:25:39,926 --> 01:25:40,956
What is it?

2201
01:25:40,956 --> 01:25:43,296
(Did Jae Seok find it?)

2202
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:44,756
- It was here. - Where?

2203
01:25:44,756 --> 01:25:45,766
Here.

2204
01:25:46,126 --> 01:25:48,666
(He finds an R box in the refrigerator...)

2205
01:25:48,666 --> 01:25:51,566
(and a car key inside it.)

2206
01:25:51,566 --> 01:25:52,666
- What is this key? - I found it.

2207
01:25:52,666 --> 01:25:54,166
- What is this key? - It's a car key.

2208
01:25:54,266 --> 01:25:55,376
- Why do we need a car key? - Where is Seok Jin?

2209
01:25:55,376 --> 01:25:57,006
- Why do we need a car key? - We need to go.

2210
01:25:57,006 --> 01:25:58,576
- Where are we going? - We need to run away.

2211
01:25:58,576 --> 01:26:00,046
- Where are we going? - Come on.

2212
01:26:00,176 --> 01:26:01,776
- Jae Seok, where are you? - Seok Jin.

2213
01:26:01,776 --> 01:26:03,146
- Yes? - Which floor are you on?

2214
01:26:03,146 --> 01:26:05,616
I am on the 13th floor. Did you find the key?

2215
01:26:05,886 --> 01:26:08,016
- Yes. - Okay, I am on the 13th floor.

2216
01:26:08,656 --> 01:26:10,616
He found it. Okay.

2217
01:26:11,016 --> 01:26:12,126
It will be game over once we take it to the car.

2218
01:26:12,126 --> 01:26:13,786
(If the boss and a villain get into the car, Team Boss wins.)

2219
01:26:13,786 --> 01:26:14,786
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

2220
01:26:15,056 --> 01:26:16,896
I told you not to go off on your own.

2221
01:26:16,896 --> 01:26:19,166
(It's the 2nd warning.)

2222
01:26:19,166 --> 01:26:22,236
Wait a minute. I am the undercover officer.

2223
01:26:22,296 --> 01:26:23,736
I am the undercover officer.

2224
01:26:23,936 --> 01:26:24,936
You are a coward.

2225
01:26:24,936 --> 01:26:27,106
(What is this coward saying?)

2226
01:26:27,366 --> 01:26:31,636
(The boss and a villain are about to have a rendezvous.)

2227
01:26:31,636 --> 01:26:32,906
(Talking noisily)

2228
01:26:37,216 --> 01:26:40,186
(They see Seok Jin.)

2229
01:26:40,186 --> 01:26:42,386
(They run at full speed.)

2230
01:26:43,086 --> 01:26:46,186
Seo Joon! Seo Joon! It's Seok Jin.

2231
01:26:46,186 --> 01:26:47,986
It's Seok Jin!

2232
01:26:47,986 --> 01:26:49,226
What are you doing?

2233
01:26:49,226 --> 01:26:50,356
- Rip off his name tag. - Rip off his name tag.

2234
01:26:50,356 --> 01:26:51,526
- Rip off his name tag. - Rip off his name tag.

2235
01:26:51,526 --> 01:26:52,826
- Why are you holding me? - Rip off his name tag.

2236
01:26:52,826 --> 01:26:54,626
- Why are you holding me? - Rip off his name tag.

2237
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:55,836
Come on.

2238
01:26:55,836 --> 01:26:57,636
Rip off his name tag. Come on.

2239
01:26:57,636 --> 01:26:58,906
- Rip off his name tag. - Rip off his name tag.

2240
01:26:58,906 --> 01:27:00,466
Listen to me.

2241
01:27:00,466 --> 01:27:02,436
- Rip off his name tag. - Don't be that way.

2242
01:27:02,576 --> 01:27:03,576
My goodness.

2243
01:27:04,106 --> 01:27:05,276
- It's over if you get Seok Jin. - It's over if you get Kwang Soo.

2244
01:27:05,276 --> 01:27:07,376
(They talk at the same time.)

2245
01:27:07,376 --> 01:27:08,846
I spent the entire day telling you this.

2246
01:27:08,846 --> 01:27:10,876
- I found out that he was it... - It's over if you get Kwang Soo.

2247
01:27:10,876 --> 01:27:12,746
- over four hours ago. - Seo Joon.

2248
01:27:12,746 --> 01:27:14,286
It's over if you get Kwang Soo. Rip off his name tag.

2249
01:27:14,786 --> 01:27:16,316
- Give me a second. - Okay.

2250
01:27:16,316 --> 01:27:17,956
Okay. Think about it.

2251
01:27:20,526 --> 01:27:21,626
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok is at the car waiting for the boss.)

2252
01:27:21,626 --> 01:27:23,726
Hurry up and come. Please hurry up and come.

2253
01:27:24,356 --> 01:27:25,396
There is the money bag.

2254
01:27:25,666 --> 01:27:27,126
There is the money bag.

2255
01:27:27,366 --> 01:27:28,396
Please.

2256
01:27:28,636 --> 01:27:30,466
(Se Chan is on standby at the lobby.)

2257
01:27:31,466 --> 01:27:34,466
(They ready themselves, and wait for the boss.)

2258
01:27:34,466 --> 01:27:35,676
For goodness' sake.

2259
01:27:37,906 --> 01:27:39,846
(My goodness.)

2260
01:27:41,576 --> 01:27:44,316
(The boss doesn't come.)

2261
01:27:44,316 --> 01:27:46,046
What is going on?

2262
01:27:48,656 --> 01:27:49,986
Something must have happened.

2263
01:27:49,986 --> 01:27:50,986
Why?

2264
01:27:50,986 --> 01:27:53,156
(There is no reason for him to be this late.)

2265
01:27:53,156 --> 01:27:54,156
Did you hear that?

2266
01:27:57,596 --> 01:28:00,726
The game is almost over.

2267
01:28:00,726 --> 01:28:02,766
You need to rip off his name tag. Rip off his name tag, Seo Joon.

2268
01:28:02,766 --> 01:28:05,566
Seo Joon, rip off his name tag. Listen to me.

2269
01:28:05,566 --> 01:28:07,466
- I am the undercover officer. - Seo Joon.

2270
01:28:07,466 --> 01:28:09,906
- Seo Joon. - I told you that before.

2271
01:28:10,206 --> 01:28:11,846
- Listen to me. - I am the undercover officer.

2272
01:28:11,846 --> 01:28:13,046
- Seo Joon. - Okay.

2273
01:28:13,046 --> 01:28:16,916
(What is his decision?)

2274
01:28:18,486 --> 01:28:20,646
- I found out that he was it... - Okay.

2275
01:28:20,646 --> 01:28:22,056
- over four hours ago. - This is crazy.

2276
01:28:22,056 --> 01:28:23,056
(He is confident.)

2277
01:28:24,116 --> 01:28:26,026
(He becomes a bit nervous.)

2278
01:28:27,056 --> 01:28:30,896
(Seok Jin seems to be nervous.)

2279
01:28:30,896 --> 01:28:32,466
You are so brazen.

2280
01:28:32,466 --> 01:28:33,996
You know what he is like, right?

2281
01:28:33,996 --> 01:28:36,536
Jae Seok is calling.

2282
01:28:36,536 --> 01:28:40,536
(What? Is Jae Seok calling?)

2283
01:28:40,566 --> 01:28:41,976
Why did he call? Hi.

2284
01:28:42,176 --> 01:28:43,736
(Be quiet.)

2285
01:28:44,776 --> 01:28:48,076
(Jae Seok calls at the crucial moment.)

2286
01:28:48,076 --> 01:28:51,416
(Can Kwang Soo prove his identity with this phone call?)

2287
01:28:51,546 --> 01:28:52,746
Hey, boss.

2288
01:28:54,486 --> 01:28:58,656
(Boss?)

2289
01:28:58,656 --> 01:28:59,656
(Jae Seok's pranking him.)

2290
01:28:59,656 --> 01:29:00,726
Boss.

2291
01:29:00,726 --> 01:29:02,156
(Jae Seok's pranking him.)

2292
01:29:02,156 --> 01:29:03,556
- Seo Joon. - Boss.

2293
01:29:04,456 --> 01:29:05,466
Hey, boss.

2294
01:29:05,926 --> 01:29:07,666
(Everything is clear now.)

2295
01:29:07,666 --> 01:29:10,736
I told you that I don't lie.

2296
01:29:11,196 --> 01:29:12,336
Seo Joon.

2297
01:29:13,836 --> 01:29:15,576
What is wrong with you?

2298
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:18,806
Why are you calling me the boss? I am the undercover officer!

2299
01:29:20,576 --> 01:29:21,576
Okay.

2300
01:29:22,746 --> 01:29:24,946
- What did he say? - He hung up right away.

2301
01:29:26,046 --> 01:29:27,586
Okay. You might misunderstand.

2302
01:29:27,686 --> 01:29:29,016
- Rip off his name tag. - Jae Seok planned this.

2303
01:29:29,186 --> 01:29:30,786
- Jae Seok planned this. - Seo Joon, rip off his name tag.

2304
01:29:30,786 --> 01:29:32,126
- I mean... - Finish him.

2305
01:29:32,126 --> 01:29:33,686
- Wait a minute. Seo Joon. - Finish him.

2306
01:29:33,686 --> 01:29:35,156
- Finish him. - It's over if you rip mine off!

2307
01:29:35,156 --> 01:29:36,626
- Listen to me. - Finish him.

2308
01:29:36,626 --> 01:29:38,256
- Hurry up. - It's over if you rip mine.

2309
01:29:38,256 --> 01:29:39,966
- It's over if you do. - Rip off his name tag.

2310
01:29:39,966 --> 01:29:42,066
- No, please! - Hurry up!

2311
01:29:42,066 --> 01:29:45,266
(Don't let the villain get the better of you.)

2312
01:29:45,266 --> 01:29:47,236
- Be quiet, you coward! - I'm not!

2313
01:29:49,076 --> 01:29:50,106
(He rips it.)

2314
01:29:50,636 --> 01:29:52,276
(Undercover officer)

2315
01:29:53,746 --> 01:29:58,846
(Kwang Soo was the undercover officer?)

2316
01:29:58,846 --> 01:30:01,416
(Team Police loses because of a single mistake.)

2317
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:02,986
We won!

2318
01:30:03,786 --> 01:30:04,916
That was incredible.

2319
01:30:05,116 --> 01:30:07,956
(Devastated)

2320
01:30:07,956 --> 01:30:09,626
I got played. What was that phone call?

2321
01:30:11,496 --> 01:30:12,526
How would I know?

2322
01:30:12,566 --> 01:30:13,666
What was that phone call?

2323
01:30:13,666 --> 01:30:15,466
I spent the entire day...

2324
01:30:16,666 --> 01:30:20,006
resolving misunderstandings.

2325
01:30:20,766 --> 01:30:22,936
That's the only thing I did today since the moment I woke up.

2326
01:30:23,076 --> 01:30:24,276
I tried to deliver the truth.

2327
01:30:24,906 --> 01:30:26,776
- The entire day... - I couldn't help it...

2328
01:30:26,776 --> 01:30:28,776
because you act too much on a regular basis.

2329
01:30:28,776 --> 01:30:30,116
People always say...

2330
01:30:31,276 --> 01:30:33,046
(He swears at Seo Joon.)

2331
01:30:33,416 --> 01:30:36,586
(You don't understand how I feel.)

2332
01:30:37,586 --> 01:30:38,986
- Jae Seok. - Kwang Soo is out.

2333
01:30:38,986 --> 01:30:40,786
- Jae Seok. - Kwang Soo is out.

2334
01:30:41,056 --> 01:30:43,526
The undercover officer, Kwang Soo, is out.

2335
01:30:43,756 --> 01:30:45,166
Okay.

2336
01:30:45,166 --> 01:30:47,996
I see that Seo Joon and Ha Neul didn't trust him.

2337
01:30:49,466 --> 01:30:54,366
(Thinking that Kwang Soo may be with the two cops,)

2338
01:30:54,366 --> 01:31:00,206
(Jae Seok decided to make him look suspicious.)

2339
01:31:00,206 --> 01:31:01,546
(Acting)

2340
01:31:02,416 --> 01:31:05,516
(Distrust led to the path of self-destruction.)

2341
01:31:05,516 --> 01:31:08,916
(Jae Seok's plan was a big success.)

2342
01:31:10,486 --> 01:31:13,456
Kwang Soo is out. Kwang Soo is out.

2343
01:31:13,456 --> 01:31:16,156
- What? - The undercover officer...

2344
01:31:16,156 --> 01:31:18,456
(The undercover officer, Kwang Soo, is out?)

2345
01:31:18,456 --> 01:31:22,736
(Does that mean Kwang Soo was the undercover officer?)

2346
01:31:24,266 --> 01:31:27,936
(I was just a liar.)

2347
01:31:29,006 --> 01:31:30,606
Haha, do you remember way back?

2348
01:31:30,906 --> 01:31:32,976
Haha. Don't you remember way back when?

2349
01:31:32,976 --> 01:31:35,876
We graduated from the police academy together!

2350
01:31:36,076 --> 01:31:38,816
You are the one who said that!

2351
01:31:39,216 --> 01:31:42,556
You are the one who mentioned the police academy!

2352
01:31:42,556 --> 01:31:44,056
- I am sorry. - Let me rip off your name tag.

2353
01:31:44,056 --> 01:31:45,926
Let me rip off your name tag.

2354
01:31:45,956 --> 01:31:49,026
Why did you say that?

2355
01:31:49,756 --> 01:31:51,826
You were not the boss.

2356
01:31:52,166 --> 01:31:53,326
You were no one of importance.

2357
01:31:53,626 --> 01:31:56,296
You were just a villain!

2358
01:31:56,536 --> 01:31:58,506
You were just a villain.

2359
01:31:59,366 --> 01:32:01,906
(I can't believe a lowly con man got me.)

2360
01:32:01,906 --> 01:32:03,036
I am sorry.

2361
01:32:03,576 --> 01:32:04,676
I am sorry.

2362
01:32:04,676 --> 01:32:06,076
(With Ha Neul's tears, the race ends.)

2363
01:32:06,076 --> 01:32:09,676
Thus, Team Boss wins.

2364
01:32:09,676 --> 01:32:12,416
(Team Boss wins with a dramatic comeback.)

2365
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,416
- Boss. - Boss.

2366
01:32:13,846 --> 01:32:14,846
Boss.

2367
01:32:15,186 --> 01:32:16,956
- Good work, everyone. - Jae Seok.

2368
01:32:16,956 --> 01:32:18,826
You did an amazing job.

2369
01:32:19,756 --> 01:32:21,656
The only thing I did today since the moment I woke up...

2370
01:32:21,656 --> 01:32:22,856
was resolve misunderstandings.

2371
01:32:24,056 --> 01:32:26,796
I told everyone that I was the undercover officer.

2372
01:32:27,766 --> 01:32:29,796
That's the only thing I said today.

2373
01:32:30,196 --> 01:32:34,706
Thus, the seven members except for Kwang Soo will share...

2374
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:36,776
the prize money of 1,000 dollars.

2375
01:32:37,276 --> 01:32:39,176
I told you to trust me.

2376
01:32:39,176 --> 01:32:41,476
The password is 6375. Please open the briefcase.

2377
01:32:41,476 --> 01:32:43,416
(What can we do with 1,000 dollars?)

2378
01:32:43,416 --> 01:32:45,386
- Is there money inside? - What is it?

2379
01:32:45,386 --> 01:32:46,516
Come on.

2380
01:32:46,846 --> 01:32:48,416
(Donation)

2381
01:32:48,416 --> 01:32:49,686
- That's good. - That's good.

2382
01:32:49,686 --> 01:32:51,786
- That's good. - Kwang Soo.

2383
01:32:51,786 --> 01:32:54,386
It brings a smile to my face. I am so happy.

2384
01:32:54,386 --> 01:32:58,456
We will donate 1,000 dollars under the 7 members' names.

2385
01:32:58,456 --> 01:32:59,666
(The money goes to Hope TV SBS.)

2386
01:33:00,066 --> 01:33:02,566
- Thank you so much. See you again. - Thank you for your hard work.

2387
01:33:02,566 --> 01:33:04,536
- Return safely. - Return safely.

2388
01:33:04,536 --> 01:33:07,366
(We thank Ha Neul and Seo Joon for working hard as the police.)

(The 2nd Summer Special of Running Man)

2390
01:33:11,676 --> 01:33:14,076
(Do you spot the bad girl...)

2391
01:33:14,076 --> 01:33:16,916
(behind the girl?)

2392
01:33:17,876 --> 01:33:21,086
(Gazes)

2393
01:33:21,086 --> 01:33:23,286
(Facial expressions)

2394
01:33:23,286 --> 01:33:27,126
(Way of speaking)

2395
01:33:27,126 --> 01:33:29,456
(Find the bad girl...)

2396
01:33:29,456 --> 01:33:32,366
