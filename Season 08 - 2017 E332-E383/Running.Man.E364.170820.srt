1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,750
Hello. Hello. Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:08,980
(The rain marks the end of summer at SBS Prism Tower.)

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,720
Haha, I have something to tell you.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,520
- Haha. - It's good to be stylish,

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:18,960
but you dress way too young...

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,260
for a middle-aged man.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,660
- Do you know that? - You look ridiculous.

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,530
- Seriously. - Come on.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,560
- Don't say that. - Listen.

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,300
Don't call me a middle-aged man.

11
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,800
She is wearing a nightgown.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,910
It's not a nightgown. It's fashionable these days.

13
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,080
- Fashionable, my foot. - Don't you know what a robe is?

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,940
- Did she just wake up? - I thought I was in a hotel.

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,810
Seeing Ji Hyo,

16
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,680
- I thought I was at a resort. - It's fashionable.

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,980
I thought I was at a resort in Sokcho.

18
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,750
My goodness, we have a professional golfer with us.

19
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,720
(So Min, nice shot.)

20
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,920
So Min, you look like a model for golf wear.

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,730
That's right.

22
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,190
- Good shot. - Nice shot.

23
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,260
Nice shot.

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,060
(Wear your confidence.)

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,570
Last week, my best friend, Se Chan, let me know...

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,070
- that he was watching... - Kwang Soo, why didn't you do it?

27
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,340
my performance on TV.

28
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,570
- He sent me a message. - Your performance was on.

29
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,740
He is different from someone who doesn't care about me.

30
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,850
(Kwang Soo is the one who doesn't care about Jong Kook.)

31
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,210
It's not like that.

32
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,080
- Kwang Soo is in trouble. - I am sorry.

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,480
When Jong Kook arrives in the morning,

34
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,520
he looks at me while he goes, "Se Chan, my best friend."

35
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,460
"My best friend".

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,860
This is how I survive.

37
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,360
- That's right. - I did watch your performance.

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,930
- I just didn't talk about it. - Promote my song on the radio.

39
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,630
Listen to me!

40
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:32,800
I watched your performance too!

41
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,870
I just didn't text you about it.

42
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,840
- I am sorry. - My goodness.

43
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,840
- Are you okay? - I am sorry.

44
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,440
- Your neck turned red. - I just didn't talk about it.

45
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,640
- Don't be ridiculous. - I am sorry.

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,180
- I acted without thinking. - Your neck turned red.

47
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,210
I am sorry.

48
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,210
(The family is ready to welcome the day.)

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,180
Today, you will have the summer vacation special,

50
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,280
Couple Retreat.

51
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
What does that entail?

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,290
(Couple Retreat)

53
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,060
There aren't enough women for the retreat.

54
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,690
- No, there aren't. - There needs to be couples.

55
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,720
Do we have guests?

56
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,530
- No way. - Lee Sun Bin.

57
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,860
(Is it the hot Lee Sun Bin?)

58
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,160
- Son Na Eun. - Na Eun?

59
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
(Is it the fawnlike Na Eun?)

60
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,630
For this retreat, we have prepared something.

61
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,740
- What is it? - Please come on in.

62
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,770
(The ones to fill the empty spots...)

63
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,770
(are coming.)

64
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,080
(Who are the guests?)

65
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,340
- Who are the guests? - We will be paired today.

66
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,210
Do we have guests today?

67
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,180
- Do we have guests today? - That must be it.

68
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,380
I guess we have guests.

69
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,220
- Why are you bringing those boxes? - That can't be it.

70
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,090
(They get boxes instead of guests.)

71
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,420
Why are we getting boxes instead of guests?

72
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,530
- Why are we getting boxes? - There are six boxes.

73
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,890
(What are these 6 boxes?)

74
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,330
What are these?

75
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,630
- There aren't enough women today. - No.

76
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,770
Two of the male members will be female students for the day.

77
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,140
(2 male members will be female students for the day.)

78
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,240
You'll go on an exciting 4-on-4 field trip.

79
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,750
All day?

80
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,980
I hate to dress up as a woman.

81
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,920
- I'll pick the last one. - I choose five.

82
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,020
I've made up my mind.

83
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,750
Please stand in front of the boxes you have chosen.

84
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,890
I'll choose this one then.

85
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,620
I'm really not sure what's what.

86
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,760
There are members who I wish wouldn't dress up as women.

87
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,230
They're Jong Kook and Seok Jin.

88
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,500
If I dress up as a woman...

89
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,770
It's because when Seok Jin dresses as a woman,

90
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,470
he looks exactly like the granny...

91
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,100
who used to run a stationery when we were young.

92
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,170
(He brings back old memories.)

93
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,610
- Exactly. - I'm serious.

94
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,110
I wondered why he looked so familiar.

95
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,580
She used to make toffee for us.

96
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,250
He looks so much like her in women's clothing.

97
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,150
(The race will be about their old memories if he gets picked.)

98
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,150
All right, everyone.

99
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,720
Those who pick the box with a wig in it...

100
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,390
will become the female members for today.

101
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,420
- What? - Something's in my box.

102
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:38,920
There's something.

103
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,490
(He finds a blonde wig in his box.)

104
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,130
It's a wig. Okay!

105
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,260
(Jae Seok gets picked.)

106
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,260
Great!

107
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,770
It's a wig. Okay!

108
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,200
(There's a red wig in Seok Jin's box.)

109
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,770
Yes!

110
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,170
(Seok Jin will be red-haired soon.)

111
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,540
Yes!

112
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,840
- How can you both get picked? - Yes!

113
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,680
- I hate it. - Who got picked?

114
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,980
We're just too unlucky.

115
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,280
- You're the unluckiest. - Seriously.

116
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,120
- I admit it. - We're too unlucky.

117
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,750
What is this? The princess...

118
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,460
It may be better this way for Seok Jin.

119
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,990
- I can't believe it. - Goodness.

120
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,030
(Stay tuned to check their girly sides.)

121
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,900
Jae Seok's name will be Janny for today.

122
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,930
- Janny? - Goodness.

123
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,260
- It sounds nice. - I like the name.

124
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,600
Am I Jinny then?

125
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,370
- Seok Jin... - Jinny?

126
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,870
will be Seok Ja.

127
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,800
- Seok Ja? - Seok Ja...

128
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,970
- Hold on. - Why is my name Korean?

129
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,570
Because your name starts with Seok.

130
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,810
(It's to make the name similar.)

131
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,410
Indeed.

132
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,850
His last name should be changed too.

133
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,980
- I know. - Seok Ja.

134
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,820
- That's funny. - Seok Ja.

135
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,390
- Seok Ja. - Seok Ja.

136
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,560
We'll now begin the Running Man, Couple Retreat.

137
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,790
Today's race is...

138
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,830
Couple Retreat: Find the Scene Stealer.

139
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,060
(Couple Retreat: Find the Scene Stealer)

140
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,300
Among you, there's a secret couple.

141
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,470
What?

142
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,240
Among you, there's a secret couple.

143
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,770
(There's a secret couple...)

144
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,310
(among us?)

145
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,480
Did someone receive their mission already?

146
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,120
The rest will win if they find the secret couple before the race ends.

147
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,880
The secret couple will win if the rest can't find them.

148
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,020
The losing team will receive a severe penalty today.

149
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,590
Until the race ends...

150
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,720
It's not me.

151
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,530
(It's you for certain.)

152
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,060
- I know it's you. - It's not me!

153
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,930
- I know it's you, punk. - No!

154
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,460
It's not me.

155
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,900
- Isn't it you? - It's not me.

156
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,430
- She did it once. - Not me.

157
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,540
- Ji Hyo. - It's not me.

158
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,600
I swear.

159
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,870
- Isn't it you? - I think it's her.

160
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,670
- I'm telling you the truth. - Everyone says they aren't the one.

161
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,240
- Not me. - The secret couple...

162
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,840
doesn't know they are the ones yet.

163
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,910
- They don't know? - Really?

164
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,550
- They don't know yet. - I see.

165
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,550
They don't know yet.

166
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,380
- Why did you grab me? - I'm sorry.

167
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,280
- Goodness. - I'm sorry.

168
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,320
They don't know yet.

169
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,450
They don't know?

170
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,320
- We... - We doubted each other for nothing.

171
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,990
- They don't know yet. - We only suspected each other.

172
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,530
The winning couple in each mission...

173
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,360
will be given a hint about the secret couple. Please do your best.

174
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,960
Now, we'll get changed into uniforms and go on the retreat.

175
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,130
(Let's start the exciting retreat with Janny and Seok Ja!)

176
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,500
I just can't stand watching Jae Seok and Seok Jin.

177
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,170
Goodness.

178
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,370
(Janny with blonde hair)

179
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,210
Give these bags to each member.

180
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,180
- Goodness. - Goodness.

181
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,580
My hair color is like Milla Jovovich's.

182
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,090
(The charismatic female warrior, Seok Ja)

183
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,690
- What? - Milla Jovovich.

184
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,590
(The charismatic female warrior, Seok Ja)

185
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,990
- I thought it was World Cup. - What?

186
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,060
(He looks like the one who came out on the streets to cheer.)

187
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,260
Aren't you here to support the national soccer team?

188
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,000
- What? - I can't stand them.

189
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,470
- Excuse me, lady. - You look like a poodle.

190
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,630
I thought there was still a World Cup match going on.

191
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,600
(Calm down, ladies.)

192
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,910
Like I told you earlier, you will do missions as couples.

193
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,240
You'll be divided into couples through a simple way.

194
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,880
The male members will be seated in the bus first.

195
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,950
The female members will get on 1 by 1.

196
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,620
They will sit next to a member whom they wish to be a couple with.

197
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,390
For the four female members,

198
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,720
if the member you want to partner up with already has a partner,

199
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,360
you may shout, "You, come out."

200
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,590
Then the male member will get to choose between the two.

201
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,990
Whom should I choose?

202
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,960
"You, come out." Is it really necessary?

203
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,030
This is supposed to be exciting.

204
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,170
- Come on. - I mean, in the past...

205
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,600
- What are you talking about? - What do you mean?

206
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,640
- This isn't... - Goodness.

207
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,240
Try appealing yourselves.

208
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,970
Who wants to partner up with me?

209
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,670
I'm sorry, but please don't come.

210
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,510
Please.

211
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,980
You've got my attention.

212
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,050
(I'm attracted to bad guys.)

213
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,250
- Don't come. - Today,

214
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,980
- he'll be my partner. - Now,

215
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,080
- I have my eyes on you. - Jong Kook.

216
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,620
It's time to consider meeting someone older than you.

217
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,590
(How do you like a woman who's 10 years older than you?)

218
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,220
- I'm serious. - What do you think?

219
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,530
- Really. - Goodness.

220
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,130
- Consider meeting older women. - No, thank you.

221
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,960
(Please let me avoid Seok Ja.)

222
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,170
Boys, please get on the bus first.

223
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,470
- Make yourself comfortable. - Sure.

224
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,640
I didn't know So Min was this pretty.

225
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,670
So Min is so pretty today.

226
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,540
- So Min is pretty. - I know.

227
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,880
She's like an angel.

228
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,580
- She's pretty. - She's amazing.

229
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,680
I want Ji Hyo.

230
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,380
I want to partner up with Ji Hyo.

231
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,890
(Why do I miss her smile more today?)

232
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,590
Jae Seok will be too tiring.

233
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,960
(I'll rather choose a fire pit.)

234
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,990
I know.

235
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,760
- Seok Ja, you'll go in first. - Don't touch him.

236
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,300
- You'll choose a male partner. - Don't touch my Jong Kook.

237
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,560
I have no intention anyway.

238
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,170
(I'm going to meet my partner who will join me and my mature charms.)

239
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,440
Gosh, it's crazy.

240
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,670
(Whom should I choose?)

241
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,040
- Ji Hyo or So Min. - Seok Ja is coming.

242
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,410
- She's coming. - Pretend to sleep first.

243
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,540
(He pretends to sleep as if he ran into a bear.)

244
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,550
I have no one to choose.

245
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,620
- It's crazy. - Seok Ja.

246
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,850
Why are you sleeping?

247
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,520
I'm going to sit next to the person who is sleeping.

248
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,620
- I had a great sleep. - Goodness.

249
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,920
- Haha. - Who's sleeping?

250
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,460
- I thought you were sleeping. - I just woke up.

251
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,330
I'm going to sit next to the person who has his eyes open.

252
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,460
- Jong Kook. - Yes?

253
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:50,300
I've made up my mind already. I'm going to sit next to you.

254
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,740
(Seok Ja will sit next to Jong Kook.)

255
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,170
- Please don't. - Nice!

256
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,640
- Don't do this. - You look great together.

257
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,210
You're attractive too.

258
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,680
- Not me. - You're attractive.

259
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,210
I have longer hair than you.

260
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,780
Didn't you suggest me to team up together before?

261
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,280
- Do that. - Come on.

262
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,980
- When you're cool. - You look great together.

263
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,890
(Janny takes a look at what's going on inside.)

264
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,160
I guess they're stopping him from sitting down.

265
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,860
- That's why it's taking long. - They're refusing him.

266
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,900
- Drink this. - I have it over there.

267
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,130
You have such nice hips.

268
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,530
(So Min compliments Janny's hips.)

269
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,570
(She's immersed in the role play.)

270
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,970
(So Min is helpless.)

271
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,740
You do have a problem.

272
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,440
"You have such nice hips."

273
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:37,320
She was taking out the water, and her hips looked so plump.

274
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,380
(Spitting out)

275
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,720
My goodness, you...

276
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,790
- Okay, I'll do it this way. - Goodness.

277
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,620
I'll choose between the strongest one and the youngest one.

278
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,360
I'll keep my words...

279
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,900
(Would you sit over there?)

280
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,400
(The red shuttlecock bounces here and there.)

281
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,430
What are you doing?

282
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,670
I'll sit here.

283
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,870
- Don't. - Hey!

284
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,370
- Is it okay for him to do this? - You can't sit here.

285
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,040
- Five. - He sat down.

286
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,940
4, 3, 2...

287
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,340
(He almost partners up with Kwang Soo then gets kicked out.)

288
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,050
Make him sit down.

289
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,720
(Everyone's desperate despite their different reasons.)

290
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,120
(Shouting)

291
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,620
- Jong Kook! - Sit down.

292
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,650
- He sat down! - Jong Kook!

293
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,060
- No! - He sat down.

294
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,430
Good.

295
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,160
It's against my will!

296
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,430
- Good. - My goodness.

297
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:25,860
I don't like you either.

298
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,500
- I really hate to be your partner. - Same here!

299
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,400
Goodness.

300
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,100
Next up is...

301
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,810
you, So Min. Go ahead.

302
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,840
(Whom should I choose as my partner?)

303
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,640
- So Min, make it quick. - Okay.

304
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,980
- So Min, this way. - Hello.

305
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,150
So Min, come to me.

306
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,290
She's so pretty.

307
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,320
(She's excited to find out what lies ahead of her.)

308
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,360
- You're so beautiful. - Take it easy and choose.

309
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,260
So Min, you know I complimented your dress today, right?

310
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,460
I told you that you're pretty.

311
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,630
If you choose me, you'll get to experience, "You, come out."

312
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,300
- Things may change. - Try it.

313
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,400
Raise your hand if you want to be my partner.

314
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,800
- Me! - Me!

315
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,830
- I'm serious. - Me!

316
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,040
(Please choose me.)

317
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,270
Put your hands down if you want to be my partner.

318
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,180
(She's enjoying this opportunity.)

319
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,310
Put them down quickly.

320
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,810
- Hey. - Raise your hands.

321
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,150
- They listen to you so well. - Put them down.

322
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,810
Stand up. Sit down.

323
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,750
Gosh, it's so exciting.

324
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,720
Tell me the person you have in mind.

325
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,690
I don't know about anything else, but I wish you to be at peace.

326
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,690
- So Min. - Choose me.

327
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,330
- Goodness. - Seok Ja, come out.

328
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,430
- What? - Gosh.

329
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,630
- Seok Ja, come out. - What?

330
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,040
Seok Ja. Okay, So Min!

331
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,170
(Welcome, So Min.)

332
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,310
- But this is... - Thanks, So Min.

333
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,310
She chose Se Chan.

334
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,510
- Se Chan isn't worth this much. - Wait a minute.

335
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,810
- You need to choose now. - What?

336
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,140
- You have to choose between us. - Okay, Seok Ja.

337
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,310
You're out.

338
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,910
Seok Ja, you're out.

339
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,450
(It wasn't necessary to ask.)

340
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,880
- Seok Ja. - So Min!

341
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,620
- Okay, sit down here. - Okay.

342
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,120
- Get out of the bus. - You have to go again.

343
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,790
- Get out. - I have to leave?

344
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,690
Seok Ja, get out.

345
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,860
- So Min. - Gosh.

346
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,560
(Se Chan and So Min are a couple.)

347
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,700
- What happened? - Goodness.

348
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,500
- What? - I got kicked out.

349
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,200
- What? - I got kicked out.

350
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,970
- It's no joke today. - It's Ji Hyo's turn.

351
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,370
They don't let you sit down.

352
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,540
- Why? - They push you away.

353
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,610
- Ji Hyo! - Goodness.

354
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,940
- Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo, come sit here.

355
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,510
Make yourself comfortable.

356
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,910
- Ji Hyo, be free. - Ji Hyo.

357
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,010
(They're the same anyway.)

358
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,920
- You'll argue with Kwang Soo. - Take it easy and choose.

359
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,780
You'll get nagged if you're with Jong Kook.

360
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:30,960
(Will Haha succeed in persuading her?)

361
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,990
- Why not? - Good. Nice.

362
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,090
(Sincerity always works.)

363
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,490
Mapo-gu.

364
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,900
We're neighbors.

365
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,100
I might be partnered up with Seok Ja.

366
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,230
(They only have Janny and Seok Ja left.)

367
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,300
What should I do?

368
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,170
- It was Seok Ja from the beginning. - What took you guys so long?

369
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,670
Go away!

370
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,810
- Look at him. Isn't he so ugly? - Goodness.

371
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,210
- Gosh, he's so ugly. - Go to him already. Sit down.

372
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,150
Seok Ja was going to be my partner all along.

373
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,210
(Kwang Soo and Janny become a couple.)

374
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,520
This is making me mad.

375
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,480
- Seok Ja, come here. - Jong Kook doesn't have a partner.

376
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,650
(Laughing)

377
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,950
If you sit next to him, it's over.

378
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,720
- Jong Kook doesn't have a partner. - This is unfair.

379
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,460
- Okay. I'm going to sit here. - There you go.

380
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,060
(Jong Kook and Seok Ja become a couple.)

381
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,930
- Didn't I tell you? - You were right. We are a couple.

382
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,730
You are done picking your partners.

383
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,430
Now, we are going to be on our way.

384
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,700
(They set out for their retreat.)

385
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,400
- A secret couple is among you. - Hold on.

386
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,670
We will start Sentence in Five Seconds, and the first hint...

387
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,880
- of the secret coupe is at stake. - Sentence in Five Seconds?

388
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,750
(Sentence in 5 Seconds?)

389
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,580
I'm very logical.

390
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,150
You must make a sentence that makes sense within five seconds...

391
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:37,620
with five keywords given to you in the order received.

392
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,260
- For example, keywords are... - It has to make sense.

393
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,990
"Jae Seok", "Jong Kook", "love", "tear", and "zombie".

394
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,960
Jae Seok loved Jong Kook too much that he became a tearful zombie.

395
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,800
- You can make a sentence like this. - That was good.

396
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,900
- You must make the sentence... - It's not hard.

397
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,200
- It's not hard. - He created a story.

398
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
(Who will be the winner?)

399
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,140
We have to use the keywords in order.

400
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,310
Oh, my. I'm getting nervous.

401
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,640
It's me, it's me

402
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,310
The person who'll use the xylophone today is me, it's me

403
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,420
He's scary when he sings the song in disguise.

404
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,120
- He's really scary. What's wrong? - He looks creepy.

405
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,290
(He looks like a possessed girl in a foreign film.)

406
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,590
I guess he's into that song now.

407
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,360
- Goodness, I hate him. - I don't like him.

408
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,490
I'll show you.

409
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,590
- Get ready. Start. - Get ready. Start.

410
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,830
Because Son Na Eun looked like a squid, I was afraid she'd...

411
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:21,300
be in my dream, but she looked like Park Na Rae, a wanted woman.

412
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,070
(Because Son Na Eun looked like a squid, I was afraid she'd...)

413
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,740
(be in my dream, but she looked like Park Na Rae, a wanted woman.)

414
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,540
That didn't make sense.

415
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,280
- Why? - It didn't make sense at all.

416
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,010
How can you say Na Eun looks like a squid?

417
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,550
- Na Eun doesn't look like a squid. - Goodness. You're unbelievable.

418
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,720
(I was rushing, so I couldn't get my thoughts organized.)

419
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,050
In my dream, Na Eun was eating a squid,

420
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,620
but I got a call from Na Rae suddenly...

421
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,290
and found out I was a wanted man.

422
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,160
- What was that? - Why? It made sense.

423
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,560
No, it didn't.

424
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,100
- Of course it made sense. - For this mission,

425
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,730
there should be only one story from start to finish.

426
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,170
Jae Seok's sentence is good enough to be printed in papers.

427
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,000
- It should be as good as this - It shouldn't be as good as that

428
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,970
(It should be as good as this)

429
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,410
- Why do you keep singing that song? - What do you mean?

430
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,940
- Of course, I should. - Jong Kook.

431
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,140
Can I start after we see the keywords?

432
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,880
- No, you can't. - Is he going to play again?

433
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,180
- I was the first one. - We'll give him one more chance.

434
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,820
- We should just move on. - That's not fair.

435
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,650
If he was going to get another chance, I could've gone first then.

436
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,790
- Don't you agree? - You're right.

437
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,720
- But why is Jong Kook angry? - I don't know.

438
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,320
- That's right! - I don't know.

439
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,820
- Whenever we play games... - I'm angry when I play games here.

440
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,460
- Be quiet. - Viewers, do you know why he's mad?

441
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,460
If anyone knows why he's mad, please write on our board online.

442
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,400
- Why is Jong Kook angry? - Why did you say that?

443
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,100
- Stop picking on Jong Kook. - When I don't like something,

444
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,740
- I can express my feelings. - But your feelings...

445
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,870
- Do we have to accept everything? - I'm sorry, but excuse me.

446
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,610
I think I just lost my hearing in one of my ears.

447
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,240
Haha.

448
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,350
- Your ears are bleeding. - My ears are hurting too.

449
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,180
- Haha, I'm losing my hearing too. - This happens in life.

450
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,750
The citizens of our country had to fight for our country.

451
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,820
You're scaring me.

452
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,820
(Se Chan fails.)

453
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,460
- All right. Ji Hyo, you'll go next. - Ji Hyo.

454
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,220
Get ready.

455
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,360
- Set. - You can do it.

456
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,930
- Don't rush. - Start.

457
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,060
Jae Seok put on a wig, farted while watching an adult film,

458
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,560
and put on the skinny jeans.

459
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,200
- That was great. - That sounded weird.

460
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,600
The skinny jeans should've been ripped.

461
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,470
- It could've worked with that. - She should've said that instead.

462
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,970
- It was a bit lacking. - She should've said it ripped.

463
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,540
Jae Seok put on the wig and was copying an act in an adult film.

464
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,810
Wait, So Min.

465
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,050
Jae Seok put on the wig and was copying an act in an adult film.

466
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,550
(What did you say?)

467
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,480
- What did you say? - She said you copied the film.

468
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,290
- That came out of nowhere. - Why would he copy that?

469
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,820
- Why would he do such a thing? - Hey, you.

470
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,290
- That made the most sense. - I can't believe you.

471
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:27,630
- She has a lot of problems. - What's wrong with you?

472
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,660
(Ji Hyo fails.)

473
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,200
- Haha, you should try. - Haha, you're up. Get ready.

474
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,260
- All right. - Start.

475
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,400
- Geun Sik's first love was Byul. - Oh, my.

476
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,600
But Mr. Kim... Darn it.

477
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,470
("Geun Sik", "first love", "Byul", "Kim", and "mother-in-law")

478
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,980
(What happened between Geun Sik and Byul?)

479
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,480
- What are you doing? Hey. - This...

480
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,280
You always...

481
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,350
(Haha fails.)

482
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,820
Watch and learn.

483
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,920
I was looking at the stars with Geun Sik's first love.

484
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,990
I saw the mother-in-law who was bringing me the dried laver.

485
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,390
- That would've worked definitely. - Of course, it would.

486
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,360
- That's right. - Your sentence was perfect.

487
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,490
You would've approved my sentence.

488
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,130
- Okay. - Get ready.

489
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,030
- This is easy. Start. - Go for it.

490
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,070
Turbo was eating ramyeon after their comeback. Because of ramyeon,

491
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:14,240
I got gout. Because of gout, I got a runny nose... This is hard.

492
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,740
- That was hard. - Come on. What was that?

493
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,880
- That was horrible. - Mine was hard. Try it yourself.

494
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,050
- Try it. - Long time ago...

495
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,450
- Try it, Jae Seok. - Turbo was eating ramyeon...

496
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,310
You should stay out of this. Hey, try this.

497
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,020
(Haha, stay out of this. Janny, try this.)

498
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,890
- Try it. Do it right now. Start. - Wait.

499
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,090
Don't think too much. Just do it.

500
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,320
- I will give this a try. - No, don't do it.

501
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,360
- Jae Seok, you have to do it. - Wait. Why did you hit my nose?

502
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,360
- Why did he hit my nose? - Try it. Start now.

503
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,000
- This is funny. - Start.

504
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,430
- Watch. - Okay.

505
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,030
Turbo was eating ramyeon, and Jong Kook who has gout came.

506
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:45,270
He had a runny nose because he was filming in the cemetery.

507
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:52,180
(I'm faster and more accurate than anyone else.)

508
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,010
- That was good actually. - See?

509
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,650
- You're good. - That was good. Do it like this.

510
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,220
I will try this. It's not hard.

511
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,850
- Get ready. - Let's do this.

512
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,460
- What are my keywords? - Start.

513
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,790
You're bald, Jeon Do Yeon.

514
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,930
Ryu Su Jeong is a viper.

515
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,300
- Grand Award... - He failed.

516
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,160
Don't just read the keywords.

517
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,570
- He just read them. - Don't read the keywords.

518
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,600
- Were you doing pansori? - That was horrible.

519
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,940
(You're bald, Jeon Do Yeon)

520
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,710
- Ryu Su Jeong... - Viper has gotten the Grand Award

521
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,970
They weren't testing your vision.

522
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,840
- I made my wife into a viper. - You were testing your vision.

523
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,780
- What are you doing? - This is hard.

524
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,810
(Seok Jin fails.)

525
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,480
- Kwang Soo. Get ready. - I'll do it now.

526
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,550
Kwang Soo, go for it!

527
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,190
Start.

528
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:37,490
So Min's molar hurts so much. So she's a romantic? She likes...

529
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,920
- cucumber kimchi. It's on sale. - Hey, you.

530
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,330
(So Min's molar hurts so much. So she's a romantic?)

531
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,360
(She likes cucumber kimchi. It's on sale.)

532
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,330
Hey, what on earth are you saying?

533
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,870
- Hey. - Goodness.

534
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,570
- He was terrible. - Kwang Soo.

535
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,070
- Are you testing your vision? - His vocabulary is so poor.

536
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,210
- Hold on. - You must go back to kindergarten.

537
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,780
No. It was just that I couldn't see.

538
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,280
(Kwang Soo fails as he gives the worst sentence.)

539
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,380
- Jae Seok, let's see what you got. - At last, here's the expert.

540
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,980
- Let's see how Jae Seok does. - Watch me.

541
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,980
The moment you get it wrong, I'm going to kick you.

542
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,120
Let's do this.

543
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,850
- Kwang Soo, if I get this right, - This is impossible.

544
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,090
- we'll get a hint. - Do it well.

545
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,150
(I'll get us the hint.)

546
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,960
For 10 years, I have never felt nervous.

547
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,530
Your lips are pale. Why are you lying?

548
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,290
- Stop shaking your legs. - Be quiet.

549
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,430
(Janny, the fluent tongue)

550
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,560
- Don't be nervous. - Get ready.

551
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,130
- I'm going to count five seconds. - Okay.

552
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,570
Start.

553
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,370
I went to a club and played the James Bond game,

554
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,100
but I found a flying chair at the club.

555
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,140
(Laughing)

556
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,910
(But I found a flying chair at the club.)

557
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,880
Goodness, Jae Seok.

558
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,450
(When you are feeling embarrassed, just laugh.)

559
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,050
- You little... - You couldn't do yours.

560
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,850
- What was that? - You couldn't do it either.

561
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,290
He was the worst.

562
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,050
- I'm so embarrassed of him. - Kwang Soo, I'm sorry.

563
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,420
- That was close. - By the way,

564
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,890
he might've rigged the game because he's the secret couple.

565
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,230
(Janny was looking at the big picture not to get caught?)

566
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,500
That makes sense.

567
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,730
- We have to... - That was weird.

568
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,470
doubt the members who seem strange to us.

569
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,940
If they are too strange...

570
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,640
Then I should start with you, Jong Kook.

571
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,410
It's because you were terrible at this game.

572
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,340
- We should suspect you first. - Fine. Do it then.

573
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,250
We should suspect you and the old lady from the stationery.

574
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,620
- Jae Seok! - To be honest,

575
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,390
she did seem a bit suspicious to me.

576
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,190
- That's right. - Hey, you.

577
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,960
We will give the hint to the couple we think was closest to succeeding.

578
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,230
- They are Jong Kook and Seok Jin. - That's right.

579
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,460
- Give us the hint. - Actually, our sentences...

580
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,900
made some sense.

581
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,270
After you check the hint, the paper will be destroyed.

582
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,870
This is a hint about the secret couple.

583
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,140
- It's up to you to share it or not. - Goodness, I was close.

584
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,170
Check the hint now.

585
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,440
- We shouldn't share it now. - No, you should share it.

586
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,480
But Jong Kook knows better. Will you share it?

587
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,020
- Then we won't share hints either. - Goodness.

588
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,690
We will share the hint later.

589
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,220
- We will destroy the paper. - The first hint is...

590
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,820
The first one won't be a crucial hint.

591
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,260
(What was the first hint?)

592
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:01,130
(They arrive excitedly at the first destination.)

593
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,070
- There are tadpoles here. - Really, Ji Hyo?

594
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,910
- They are real tadpoles. - There are so many of them.

595
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,140
- I haven't seen them in ages. - There are tadpoles here.

596
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,780
- They released them. - There are a lot of them.

597
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,110
They are my friends.

598
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,810
I have so many friends.

599
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,250
(So Min feels excited as she meets her friends.)

600
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,020
- You have so many friends. - I forgot about my old friends.

601
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,150
- I don't remember them. - Everyone.

602
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,150
We are going to start our fun retreat.

603
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,290
I played with them a lot because I didn't have toys growing up.

604
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,790
I played with tadpoles and frogs.

605
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,830
What? What is this?

606
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,000
- Is this the class leader? - It's the class leader.

607
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,770
- You are the class leader? - Are you the class leader?

608
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,770
- No, the class leader called me. - Why do we have a class leader?

609
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,470
(A call from the class leader. Did we have a class leader?)

610
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,570
- Hello? - This is your class leader.

611
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,740
What did you say?

612
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,950
- The class leader called you. - Who are you?

613
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,780
- It's Chul Min. - He's turning into a liar.

614
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,520
- You should've at least hidden. - He's so brazen.

615
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,590
- At least conceal yourself. - What are you doing in front of us?

616
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,220
(This is ridiculous.)

617
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,260
- You should've hid somewhere. - You are so shameless.

618
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,260
- Hey. - You're right in front of us.

619
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,390
Just tell us.

620
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,830
- Hey, the class leader is calling. - Hi, class leader.

621
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,800
- Hold on. I'm going to college? - I think I can hear his voice.

622
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,970
- I can hear him too. - Who is this?

623
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,330
- Let me ask you this. - Who is it?

624
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:11,470
- I'm in college now? - Yes.

625
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,640
Hello, this is your class leader. Have the six of you arrived safely?

626
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,940
(Have the 6 of you arrived safely?)

627
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,380
- 6? You meant to say 8. - You're looking at us.

628
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,720
(There are 8 of us.)

629
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,390
(Why is the class leader saying there are only 6 of us?)

630
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,290
What? Only six of you went.

631
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,160
- Can you check again? - I just got the chills.

632
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,460
Are there ghosts?

633
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,100
(We told you. There are 8 of us.)

634
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,600
- I seriously got the goose bumps. - Hey!

635
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,330
- Look at us. There are eight. - All right.

636
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,900
- Let's count ourselves again. - Then two of us...

637
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,340
- are ghosts? - 1. Say 2.

638
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,540
- 2. - 3.

639
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,640
- Say 4. - 4.

640
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,910
- 5. - 6.

641
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,280
- 7. - 8.

642
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,440
- We're eight. - What is this?

643
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,720
(There are 8.)

644
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,250
(They got a mysterious call from their class leader.)

645
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,950
- What's going on? - Two are invisible?

646
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:05,490
(The class leader asked if the 6 of them arrived.)

647
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,530
Let me announce the real theme of today's race.

648
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,390
Summer vacation horror special,

649
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,160
Find the Ghosts.

650
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,770
(Summer vacation special: Find the Ghosts)

651
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,100
Two of you have a different identity from the others.

652
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,270
- Before the race ends, - Who are they?

653
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,610
- you have to identify each other, - I'm not.

654
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,610
and the surviving team will win.

655
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,880
The losing team will receive a scary penalty.

656
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,010
It's a horror special.

657
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,620
(The losing team will face a horrible penalty.)

658
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,250
(The trip started out fine, but a surprise is waiting for them.)

659
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,530
(Escape the empty school at dawn.)

660
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,100
(Which team will go through this horror?)

661
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,900
- Let's see. - You'll get hints about ghosts...

662
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,030
if you complete a mission.

663
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,300
The hint that was given on the bus was also about the ghosts.

664
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,410
Think about it. You should share it with us if it's about the ghosts.

665
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,640
MT stands for mystery thriller.

666
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,180
(MT turns out to stand for mystery thriller.)

667
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,520
(Laughing)

668
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,820
MT stands for mystery thriller?

669
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,290
Thriller...

670
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,220
(Is that the right spelling?)

671
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,560
- It starts with T. - Doesn't it start with S?

672
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,120
- It starts with "Th". - "Th".

673
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,320
- "Th". - It's S.

674
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,430
It's "Th".

675
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,260
It starts with "Th", not S.

676
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,800
- Thriller. - Thriller.

677
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,900
- "Th". - Really?

678
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,400
- It was a horror special. - Hold on.

679
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,440
- Let's move back a little. - I got it.

680
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,300
If we're to find ghosts... Hey, you ghost.

681
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,270
What's with you?

682
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:28,910
What are you doing?

683
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,880
- You're a ghost. - This is ridiculous.

684
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,740
We've found one.

685
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,010
And here's a grandma ghost.

686
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,820
(Janny thinks Seok Ja is a ghost.)

687
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,450
He's a Hong Kongese grandma ghost.

688
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,290
- Hong Kongese grandma ghost. - You're a poodle ghost.

689
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,720
You're a stationery store ghost.

690
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,620
(The grandma ghost has dyed her hair red.)

691
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,120
- I know who the ghosts are. - So do I.

692
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,590
You don't have a shadow.

693
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,390
What about you?

694
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,960
There's no sun.

695
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,130
You don't have a shadow.

696
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,330
It's raining.

697
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,700
- There's no sun. - You don't have a shadow.

698
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,970
- What are you talking about? - You don't have a shadow.

699
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,800
Now, there is something you should check secretly.

700
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,610
Your identity is in the bag with your name on it.

701
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:09,110
Check it secretly with your cameraman.

702
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,720
We're finding out now?

703
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,720
Right now?

704
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,390
Then why did you grab me by the neck?

705
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,720
I didn't even know.

706
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,290
We're finally finding out.

707
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,290
(They are not allowed to share their identities with each other.)

708
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,330
My goodness.

709
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,700
Let's see.

710
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,830
- My goodness. - What are you?

711
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,800
(Which two of them have special identities?)

712
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,340
I'm not a ghost.

713
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,740
Hey!

714
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,840
There's no sun.

715
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:43,180
(It's hard to read their faces.)

716
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,890
(Why is Ji Hyo giving her cameraman a high five?)

717
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,090
(Everyone is aware of his or her identity now.)

718
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,120
(You're obviously a ghost.)

719
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,230
- It's you, right? - No.

720
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,290
- It's you. - It's not, I swear.

721
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,130
- It's you. - Why did you give him a high five?

722
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,660
- Me? - A high five.

723
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,830
Because I'm not a ghost.

724
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,930
I'm not a ghost. I swear.

725
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,600
- You're suspicious. - Hey. You even got the hint.

726
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,070
(A moment ago)

727
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,540
(Ji Hyo...)

728
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:14,350
(is a human.)

729
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:19,220
(She gave her cameraman a high five to celebrate that she's a human.)

730
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,350
Two of us are ghosts.

731
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,360
(Jong Kook is sure Ji Hyo is a ghost.)

732
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,560
I saw Jae Seok's identity.

733
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,730
You did? Is he a ghost?

734
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:27,830
- Yes. - He is?

735
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,000
Ji Hyo is definitely a ghost, right?

736
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,600
What are you doing?

737
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
He's a human.

738
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,100
(It's so random.)

739
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,900
What makes you think so?

740
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,970
Because it hurt.

741
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,310
- Because it hurt? - You're a human.

742
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,310
What?

743
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,910
(Slap)

744
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,510
- Did it hurt? - Did it hurt?

745
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,910
It hurt a lot.

746
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,910
It hurt.

747
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,850
You're a ghost if you don't have any mole on your neck.

748
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,520
- Why? - That's how it is.

749
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,520
You don't have any. You have one.

750
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,420
- You have one too. - Is this how we're going to play?

751
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,720
I'm a ghost.

752
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,520
What do we even have to think about?

753
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,190
You have a red mole.

754
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,190
It's red. You have to remove it at the dermatologist.

755
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,000
- Really? - It's not a good thing.

756
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,170
Stop the nonsense already.

757
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,900
I feel like I'm possessed by a ghost.

758
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,300
Aren't you a ghost?

759
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,170
- If you eat a goat's poop... - All right.

760
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:17,010
You all know your identities now, right?

761
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,080
- Yes. - Yes.

762
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,780
Then let's move to another place...

763
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,610
and start a mission where you can obtain a hint about the ghosts.

764
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,450
- I need it. - Okay!

765
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,220
- Let's go! - What's with you?

766
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,150
- He's a ghost. - He's a ghost.

767
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,350
He's possessed by a ghost.

768
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,420
(Who are the ghosts?)

769
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,190
Are we spinning again?

770
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,760
- It's a game. - Isn't that the spinning equipment?

771
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,800
Is it a relay?

772
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Are we spinning again?

773
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,430
We're not spinning?

774
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,800
That's good. We might throw up.

775
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,370
- Right. We all easily become sick. - We're not good at anything.

776
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,210
What is this?

777
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:53,080
We might be able to see who the ghosts are.

778
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,020
We'll probably put a stocking over our head.

779
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,720
This mission is called Relay Stocking Olympics.

780
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,890
You have to pass through the four sections...

781
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,560
within 100 seconds.

782
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,930
When one team finishes the race,

783
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:10,460
- you get half a hint. - I see.

784
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,900
If both teams succeed,

785
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,270
you'll get the entire hint.

786
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,500
- I see. - We have to get the hint.

787
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,770
Please form 2 teams of 4...

788
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:21,410
- and go to the starting point. - Okay.

789
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,510
2 teams of 4?

790
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,110
- Let's just stick to these groups. - Let's do that.

791
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,640
- No rock-paper-scissors? - Let's just stick to it.

792
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,610
- Listen to me. - Let's just do it this way.

793
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:30,180
- Let's play a game. - It's a hassle.

794
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,380
If it's a hassle, why doesn't he just stay home?

795
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,190
(I'm sorry, but why bother?)

796
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,320
- Gosh. Se Chan. - Kwang Soo.

797
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,560
Kwang Soo.

798
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,090
Jong Kook is hurt.

799
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,760
Who doesn't know that? Why would you say that?

800
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,760
- Why would you say that? - Who doesn't know that?

801
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,970
(Why is he hurt?)

802
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,640
Everyone will put a stocking over their heads.

803
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,000
You can start the race only when the member before you is finished.

804
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,640
- Okay. - Okay.

805
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,310
- Okay. - Kwang Soo, please move.

806
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,780
- Okay. - Okay.

807
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,580
Ji Hyo would work hard to avoid suspicion.

808
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,720
If she is a ghost, she will work hard.

809
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
(Ji Hyo is definitely a ghost.)

810
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,890
(I'm a human.)

811
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,590
(Humans should try to complete the mission and obtain hints.)

812
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:18,160
(Ghosts would try to hold the humans back.)

813
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,500
(Ji Hyo, Jae Seok, Haha, Kwang Soo)

814
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,900
I haven't done this in a long time.

815
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,370
Pull it over my head?

816
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,740
Gosh.

817
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,810
Jae Seok, you look amazing.

818
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,610
- You're amazing. - The king is back.

819
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:37,320
Your face is a mess.

820
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,750
Kwang Soo looks like Squidward.

821
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,250
(A squid on land)

822
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,120
It's a mess.

823
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,320
- Squidward... - Kwang Soo.

824
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,660
It's a mess.

825
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,830
Ji Hyo, show us your face.

826
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:49,990
(It looks horrible.)

827
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,900
This is priceless.

828
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,900
- Ready. - Hold it.

829
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,070
- Like this? - Yes.

830
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,070
- Go. - Run.

831
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:01,410
- You have to succeed. - You have to succeed.

832
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,140
(It's hard to even get close to the beans.)

833
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,880
If you don't succeed, you are a ghost.

834
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,450
Ji Hyo looks okay.

835
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,410
- Go farther. - She doesn't look bad.

836
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,420
Good.

837
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,820
Look at the beans.

838
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,720
- Look at the beans. - Look at the beans.

839
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,820
(Struggling)

840
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:19,020
Unbelievable. Ji Hyo can look ugly too.

841
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,760
Well... There you go. Good.

842
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,460
Good. Ji Hyo is amazing.

843
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,600
- Two. - There you go.

844
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,770
You're doing great. You're fast.

845
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:27,770
Keep going.

846
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,630
- Three. - Yes.

847
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,700
She's good at everything.

848
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,800
- Four. - Okay.

849
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,800
- She's good at everything. - The last one.

850
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,810
- Five. - Okay.

851
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:36,980
(Ji Hyo is done moving 5 beans.)

852
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,810
Okay.

853
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,610
The king is back.

854
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,180
(I'm the king of face today.)

855
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,980
(He's unbelievable.)

856
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,990
He's amazing.

857
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,090
(He's unbelievable.)

858
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:53,990
(Pay respect to the king's face.)

859
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,800
- Look at him. - No one can beat him.

860
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,960
Good.

861
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,270
We should take a picture.

862
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,530
We have to make it.

863
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,000
- Okay. - He's unbeatable.

864
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,100
We have to take a picture.

865
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,610
- Take one from here. - Go away.

866
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,270
(The picture of the king is saved in my phone.)

867
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,640
How can he look like that?

868
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,080
- Let's do this. - Okay.

869
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,210
Let's get the hint.

870
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:19,980
(The ghosts would try to fail the mission.)

871
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,420
Time is passing by.

872
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,520
Isn't that obvious?

873
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,920
(Annoyed)

874
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,290
(You're right.)

875
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,890
- I'm just warning you. - Of course, time is passing by.

876
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,100
- Okay. - It's hard, right?

877
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,130
It's hard.

878
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,100
- How many more? - Just one more.

879
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,400
- Success. - Okay.

880
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,270
(Jae Seok calms down, and finishes his task.)

881
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,270
He's done.

882
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,410
- You're going too fast. - All right.

883
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,510
- Oh, my. - What happened to his lips?

884
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,410
- Hey. - Isn't that a goby?

885
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:48,610
(Isn't that a goby?)

886
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,020
- It's a nutria. - Amazing.

887
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:55,120
(Haha has to hit two go stones off the board.)

888
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,250
What happened to his lips?

889
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,420
- Hey. - Isn't that a goby?

890
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,420
(Missing)

891
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,160
My lips looked like that too.

892
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,130
Hey.

893
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,900
- Slow down. - It's hard.

894
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,300
I did a good job.

895
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,970
- Are you failing on purpose? - Exactly.

896
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,600
- He's suspicious. - It's hard.

897
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,210
(Haha's continuous failure is making the others suspicious.)

898
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,010
- You're suspicious. - He must be a ghost.

899
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,810
- He's a ghost. - It's too obvious.

900
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,780
Hurry up. Time is ticking.

901
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,310
- He's failing on purpose. - He's a ghost.

902
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,780
I'm doing my best.

903
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,120
Are you sure?

904
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
I swear.

905
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,520
(Haha has been suspicious. Is he a ghost?)

906
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,560
- I swear. - He's suspicious.

907
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,830
- He's so bad. - It's hard.

908
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,990
What?

909
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,160
Okay.

910
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,600
(Haha finally finishes his task.)

911
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,330
Gosh.

912
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,770
(Haha has done a bad job. What is his identity?)

913
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,570
Come here.

914
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,180
- The best player is up. - Go on, Kwang Soo.

915
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,910
Go on.

916
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:56,180
(He only has 5 candles to blow out.)

917
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,580
(If he succeeds, he earns half of a hint about the ghosts.)

918
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,260
(His skin is very resilient.)

919
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,290
You're doing well.

920
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:11,700
(Kwang Soo looks like a squid.)

921
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,300
You're doing well, Kwang Soo.

922
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,170
- Hurry up. - He looks hilarious.

923
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,340
Move forward a little more.

924
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,570
Blow the candles.

925
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,080
What's the name of that large rat? Is it called nutria?

926
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,610
- He looks like a nutria. - You got it.

927
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,750
(He blows out 5 candles.)

928
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,680
- Okay. - He got it.

929
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,990
He was quite fast.

930
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,120
He was definitely fast.

931
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,520
(Will they get half of a hint about the ghosts?)

932
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,360
2 minutes 20 seconds.

933
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,890
- What's the time? - 2 minutes 20 seconds.

934
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,830
(They fail to earn the hint.)

935
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,060
Isn't that 100 seconds?

936
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,770
- Gosh, it's 140 seconds. - I was embarrassed.

937
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,740
Haha was being very strange.

938
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,070
- No, I wasn't. - He was careless at the end.

939
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:56,440
Tapping it a few times didn't work. I did it very carefully. I swear.

940
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,810
I've played it before.

941
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,940
- It's not that hard. - If you tap it...

942
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:05,350
(Haha was being especially slow today.)

943
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,320
- It's different from tapping. - He couldn't do it quickly.

944
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,490
I don't think he's good at it.

945
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:10,590
As you clear the mission,

946
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,360
there are ghosts among you.

947
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,230
Pick four members randomly.

948
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,500
We'll give you one last chance.

949
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,700
If you succeed,

950
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,630
I'll give you a hint about the ghosts.

951
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,800
Okay.

952
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,000
It's the four of us.

953
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,970
- It's the four of you. - Here we go.

954
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:30,080
(Jong Kook is up next.)

955
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,480
Jong Kook looks very scary.

956
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,250
- I think he closed his eyes. - That's not how you wear it.

957
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:39,180
(Jong Kook's robot-like face looks more frightening than a ghost.)

958
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,620
These are different.

959
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,020
- Didn't we use them before? - Are they smaller?

960
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,720
(He succeeds 1 immediately.)

961
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,830
He's good.

962
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,160
- Try that one. - It's not easy.

963
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,430
- Take your time. - Hit the one on the top.

964
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:51,330
Try the other one.

965
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,000
- No, it doesn't work. - He's good.

966
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:56,230
Hit the one on the left!

967
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,740
- The left. - I got it.

968
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,940
Blow out the five candles.

969
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,940
Pull harder.

970
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,680
- Come here. - You can do it, So Min.

971
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,610
Hurry up, So Min.

972
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,250
Blow out the candles now.

973
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,720
Blow.

974
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,350
(So Min walks heavily.)

975
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,720
Blow from there.

976
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,520
- You have 20 seconds. - 20 seconds.

977
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,690
We need the hint.

978
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,430
- Hurry up. - We need the hint.

979
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,330
Look at her.

980
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,260
- Where are you aiming? - The candles are here.

981
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,630
Come on.

982
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,000
(She uses her hand.)

983
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,040
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

984
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,710
(What is she trying to do?)

985
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,870
The stocking is pulled down too low.

986
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:38,140
- Pull it up to the chin. - Pull it up.

987
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,840
You're good. Try it.

988
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,950
It'll work.

989
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,550
Blow out the candles now.

990
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,920
Blow them out.

991
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,990
- Blow them out. - Blow.

992
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,790
- Blow out the left one. - She's stuck.

993
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,020
- There you go. - She made it.

994
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:54,490
(Thanks to Jong Kook's help, So Min succeeds.)

995
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,830
You made it.

996
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,200
Good job, So Min.

997
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,430
(Relay Stocking Olympics' Round 2 is over.)

998
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,970
The time limit is 150 seconds.

999
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,170
Your record is 149.82 seconds.

1000
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,570
(They clear the mission miraculously.)

1001
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,670
That's right.

1002
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,710
Let's catch the ghosts.

1003
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,010
It'll be given to everyone.

1004
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,610
- Here's the hint. - The hint is given to everyone.

1005
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,350
- Okay. - All right.

1006
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,750
I can prove that I'm not a ghost.

1007
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,890
(What's the second hint?)

1008
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,060
Let's take a look.

1009
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,490
- "Legal name"? - What's this?

1010
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,030
What does that mean?

1011
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,260
- It's half of a hint. - What?

1012
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,960
It's someone who uses a nickname.

1013
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,800
It's Haha and Ji Hyo.

1014
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,570
(The ghosts may be Haha and Ji Hyo.)

1015
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,870
- There's only two. - What is this?

1016
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,810
The hint can either be...

1017
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,540
the ghosts use nicknames...

1018
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,040
or not.

1019
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,340
You only received half of a hint.

1020
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,850
- Then it's useless. - Right.

1021
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,420
There's something that you're missing.

1022
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,350
There are more who use nicknames.

1023
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:56,190
- There's Janny. - Seok Ja?

1024
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,490
Come on, those don't count.

1025
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,090
Those don't count.

1026
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,130
Yes, they do.

1027
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,360
Why would I be given a nickname?

1028
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,000
Hints in the beginning are usually general.

1029
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,200
- If it's about nicknames... - That's not right.

1030
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,770
Didn't we get a specific hint in the beginning?

1031
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,340
You should tell us.

1032
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,010
It's pointless to keep it a secret.

1033
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:17,080
Since many of you want it, we'll share the hint.

1034
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,540
- The hint was... - We don't have a reason to hide it.

1035
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,280
This is what I find funny.

1036
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,550
Both of you saw the hint.

1037
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:26,520
Does Seok Jin need Jong Kook's permission?

1038
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,750
(Seok Jin is controlled by Jong Kook.)

1039
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,020
By the way,

1040
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,320
I'm sure that Seok Jin is a ghost.

1041
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,730
I keep hearing an echo.

1042
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,930
He keeps repeating...

1043
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,430
what Jong Kook says.

1044
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,600
He's like a bird...

1045
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,200
that imitates what people say.

1046
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:43,330
Hello, hello.

1047
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,900
- Tell us. - He's like that bird.

1048
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,170
I'm glad that you're on my side.

1049
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,140
I'm serious. Okay.

1050
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,640
Let's share the hint.

1051
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,980
This hint is actually quite general.

1052
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:58,020
"One of the ghosts is unlucky."

1053
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,650
(The hint is "one of the ghosts is unlucky.")

1054
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:04,820
You should share the hint with us. We won't share it next time.

1055
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:09,890
(With this hint, they can narrow down the possibilities.)

1056
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:14,130
"One of the ghosts is unlucky."

1057
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,430
One of them is unlucky.

1058
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,540
It depends on who's very lucky...

1059
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,700
- or unlucky. - By the way,

1060
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,840
Haha is also unlucky.

1061
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:26,210
(They start to suspect those who are unlucky.)

1062
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,280
Some of us won't be able to eat.

1063
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,650
I really want to eat.

1064
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:35,690
If you clear this mission, you earn a Meal Card and a hint.

1065
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,590
- Okay. - Meal Card?

1066
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,090
We're known to be unlucky when it comes to meals.

1067
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,530
I'm the unluckiest.

1068
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,600
We won't get to eat again.

1069
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
- I'll drop out of this game. - I'll win.

1070
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,730
(Give us the loser's meal.)

1071
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,140
This mission is called...

1072
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,700
Guess the Movie.

1073
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,770
(Guess the Movie)

1074
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:57,110
It's an individual game related to movies.

1075
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,810
- Is it an individual game? - Movies?

1076
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,050
Choose the time at which you want to listen.

1077
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,220
We'll play the audio of the movie at that time for 10 seconds.

1078
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,420
- Do we guess the movie title? - I'll definitely win.

1079
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,550
Guess the movie title based on the audio.

1080
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,760
I watch so many movies.

1081
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,320
- Is it an individual game? - Yes.

1082
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,660
(Se Chan is very confident.)

1083
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,230
You win a hint and a Meal Card for a full course meal.

1084
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,700
- Okay. - A full course meal?

1085
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,970
The next three members get a Meal Card for a midsize meal.

1086
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,130
The last four members...

1087
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,800
will get a Meal Card for a small meal.

1088
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,910
I've been unlucky with food these days.

1089
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,440
It's driving me insane.

1090
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,210
- Let's start with Se Chan. - Me?

1091
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,810
- For the first movie, - I'm really bad at this.

1092
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:36,110
- tell us the minute and the second. - Se Chan starts.

1093
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,580
Let's see.

1094
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:40,250
(He must choose the time wisely.)

1095
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,920
- I pick 48 minutes 40 seconds. - That's a bad choice.

1096
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,590
(He chooses 48 minutes 40 seconds.)

1097
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,720
That's a bad choice.

1098
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,530
- It's hard to say. - Here's the first movie.

1099
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:50,160
- It's my turn anyway. - Right.

1100
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,600
At that time, for a 1.5-hour movie...

1101
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,630
- It's a boring part. - That's right.

1102
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,170
- It's boring. - It's before things happen.

1103
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:00,000
You'll hear it exactly for 10 seconds.

1104
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,270
10 seconds? Let's go.

1105
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,970
Play the movie.

1106
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,580
- Aren't we leaving? - Yes.

1107
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,850
Say hello to my nephew.

1108
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,750
It's a Korean movie.

1109
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:15,690
- It's difficult. - I have no idea.

1110
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,090
I only heard footsteps.

1111
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:19,020
- I have no idea. - Where did they go?

1112
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,360
- You have to make a guess. - They were talking while walking.

1113
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,760
(He tries to make an inference.)

1114
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,860
It's impossible to know.

1115
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,670
Which movie related to fish were you in?

1116
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,600
(He asks all of a sudden.)

1117
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,970
It's not about fish.

1118
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,410
It's called "Collective Invention".

1119
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,640
- It's "Collective Invention". - No, it's not.

1120
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,810
- It's... - It's...

1121
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,810
- a famous movie. - What is it?

1122
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:41,450
- So Min is next. - Whose voice was it?

1123
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,780
One hour.

1124
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,080
40 minutes.

1125
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,920
- 1 hour 40 minutes? - Yes.

1126
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,420
- It's a recent movie. - Play the movie.

1127
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,120
If he's a ghost...

1128
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,290
Gosh, this is easy.

1129
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:56,660
If he's a ghost...

1130
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:59,100
(The line sounds familiar.)

1131
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,130
(They know the answer.)

1132
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,640
- It's so easy. - Be quiet.

1133
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,500
It's obvious. She picked a good time.

1134
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,870
- She picked a great time. - Goodness.

1135
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:08,940
I didn't hear it.

1136
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,080
I know the actor's name.

1137
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,410
- She couldn't hear it. - I couldn't hear it.

1138
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,110
She's a ghost if she guesses wrong.

1139
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,950
So Min.

1140
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,220
- You have three seconds. - I don't hear well.

1141
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,050
(She ponders.)

1142
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,120
- Two. - "Friend"?

1143
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,690
No, it isn't.

1144
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:26,220
The movie relates to today's theme.

1145
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,360
What do you think, Jong Kook?

1146
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,490
I know the answer.

1147
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,430
(Will his answer be correct?)

1148
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,730
- Are you... - "The Wailing".

1149
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:36,740
(Jong Kook is correct.)

1150
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,570
It's so obvious.

1151
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:44,810
(It's the highlight scene that So Min selected.)

1152
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:49,180
(This is the scene that Se Chan selected.)

1153
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,880
Say hello to my nephew.

1154
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,690
She's a ghost.

1155
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:55,020
How can she not recognize it?

1156
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:58,220
We said that the movie relates to today's theme.

1157
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,090
- She may not know. - I watched "The Wailing" twice.

1158
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,490
- Right. - The sound wasn't clear.

1159
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:02,860
Let's start with So Min.

1160
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,060
1 hour 20 minutes.

1161
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,130
- 1 hour 20 minutes? - Yes.

1162
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,970
- Play the movie. - What if it's an hour long?

1163
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,300
It may be a scene without lines.

1164
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,170
The sound may not be clear.

1165
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:16,040
(What kind of background music is it?)

1166
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,480
(He pretends to know.)

1167
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,210
I think the movie ended.

1168
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,310
- This is... - It's a foreign movie.

1169
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,450
- Which song is it? - Is it that movie?

1170
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,690
- It's a foreign movie. - Which song is it?

1171
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:27,850
Isn't it a foreign movie?

1172
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:31,190
I don't think I'll get a chance to answer.

1173
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,960
- I don't recognize it. - You have three seconds.

1174
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,190
- 3, 2, - So Min.

1175
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:36,560
- I have no idea. - 1.

1176
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,430
"Christmas in August"?

1177
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,730
1 hour 5 minutes.

1178
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,830
Here's 1 hour 5 minutes.

1179
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:44,200
I might get a chance.

1180
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,700
Play the movie.

1181
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,540
(Panting)

1182
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,740
Is it an adult movie?

1183
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,810
(Panting)

1184
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,080
Is it an adult movie?

1185
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,280
Dear fellow students.

1186
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,450
Fall is coming to an end...

1187
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,590
- I got it. - I got it.

1188
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:04,920
- Fall is coming to an end... - I got it.

1189
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,890
(I got it.)

1190
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,630
- "Dear fellow students." - "Fall is coming to an end."

1191
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:10,700
"Fall is coming to an end."

1192
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,530
It's a school movie.

1193
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,600
- A school movie? - A school movie?

1194
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,400
Is that a thing?

1195
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,670
It's a school movie.

1196
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,840
(Seok Ja shows off his broad vocabulary.)

1197
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,270
You have three seconds.

1198
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:24,640
It features Kim Soo Hyun at the end.

1199
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,540
- Three, - Was it Sulli?

1200
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,450
- two, - No .What's the title?

1201
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:30,580
- one. - Hold on.

1202
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,820
He's failed.

1203
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,390
I don't remember the title.

1204
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:35,320
- It's not that one. - Seok Ja.

1205
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,650
(It's Seok Ja's turn.)

1206
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,990
1 hour 33 minutes.

1207
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:44,100
- 10 seconds from 1 hour 33 minutes. - The movie would be over.

1208
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,660
- No. - It'd be over.

1209
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,570
Play the movie.

1210
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,770
The movie is over. There are only subtitles.

1211
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,210
- The credits are rolling. - Please be quiet.

1212
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,210
It's the credits.

1213
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,740
It's over.

1214
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:03,150
My huckleberry friend, Moon River

1215
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,180
(He suddenly sings.)

1216
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,520
- Moon River - I got it.

1217
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,260
- Moon River - What is it?

1218
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,860
(Seok Ja just shows off her singing skills.)

1219
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,660
My huckleberry friend

1220
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:16,930
Three,

1221
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,330
- two... - "Miss Granny"?

1222
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:20,830
- No. - It's not that one.

1223
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,200
"Whispering Corridors".

1224
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:23,540
- Gosh. - "Whispering Corridors".

1225
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,400
It doesn't have that kind of music.

1226
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,510
It's a school movie with ghosts.

1227
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,310
I know this one.

1228
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,740
(Se Chan says he knows the answer.)

1229
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:31,810
Please don't say the right answer.

1230
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:33,750
58 minutes 30 seconds.

1231
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,510
- 58 minutes 30 seconds. - We're close.

1232
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,480
Play the movie.

1233
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,480
(What kind of part would it be?)

1234
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:45,120
What would we be doing?

1235
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,090
I'd be an architect, and you'd be a pianist.

1236
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:51,800
I got it.

1237
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:55,700
(I'd be an architect.)

1238
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,670
- I got it. - Amazing.

1239
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,570
I'd be an architect, and you'd be a pianist.

1240
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,970
(Kwang Soo's choice was perfect.)

1241
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:05,040
I know this.

1242
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,710
I got it.

1243
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,250
Unbelievable.

1244
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:09,710
It's this movie.

1245
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,580
- Kwang Soo. - I knew this one.

1246
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:13,350
- "Architecture 101". - That's right.

1247
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:15,090
Gosh.

1248
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:19,990
(Architecture 101)

1249
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:24,400
(Kwang Soo chose a dating scene.)

1250
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,900
(The pretty voice...)

1251
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,430
(was Suzy's.)

1252
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:33,770
(The music was from a scene where the man looks around the house.)

1253
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:37,580
"You'd be a pianist, and I'd be..."

1254
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:40,450
- I knew this one. - It gave me goosebumps.

1255
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:42,250
You heard everything.

1256
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,050
I'll find the ghosts.

1257
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:46,420
- I'll find them. - Aren't you a ghost?

1258
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,020
You're a ghost yourself.

1259
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:50,390
Let's go. The next one.

1260
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,560
55 minutes 18...

1261
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,760
55 minutes 17 seconds.

1262
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,830
Play the movie.

1263
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:00,870
(If Kwang Soo gets it right, he will win first place.)

1264
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:08,540
- Isn't that what the law says? - What are you talking about?

1265
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,040
It's illegal to stop the guardian from visiting.

1266
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,180
Then...

1267
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:18,780
(The dialect and the content are unusual.)

1268
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:20,050
You...

1269
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:26,120
I know this one. I definitely know this one.

1270
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:28,730
I can bet my everything that I know it.

1271
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:30,500
- You don't know this one? - Wait.

1272
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,330
I know this one.

1273
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,500
(Excited)

1274
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:37,740
(Song Kang Ho talks about the law in Busan dialect.)

1275
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,710
(The correct answer is "The Attorney".)

1276
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:44,980
(This famous movie featured Song Kang Ho and the late Kim Young Ae.)

1277
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:48,680
(Kwang Soo made an excellent choice once again. Will he win?)

1278
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:53,920
- "Barefoot Ki-bong". - It's not that one.

1279
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:56,420
- Barefoot Kwang Soo. - Can I say the answer right away?

1280
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,520
I know this one.

1281
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,520
- Can I say it? - I know this one.

1282
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,160
- Just say it. - My answer is...

1283
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,260
Okay.

1284
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:02,490
- "The Attorney". - That's right.

1285
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:04,260
- It's correct. - All right.

1286
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,770
(Janny wins first place.)

1287
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:09,400
(That's right.)

1288
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:12,600
- I thought it was "The Lawyer". - He thought it was "The Lawyer".

1289
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,310
(Seok Ja is so charming.)

1290
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:16,470
- "The Lawyer"... - "The Lawyer"?

1291
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,380
That's right.

1292
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,080
Jae Seok...

1293
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:22,880
- won a hint... - Oh, my.

1294
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,720
as well as a full meal.

1295
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,320
(I can't believe this.)

1296
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,220
- I'm jealous. - Now...

1297
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,590
I'm so frustrated I lost the chance to Jae Seok.

1298
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:32,920
- Really. - Let's continue.

1299
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:37,430
We'll determine 2nd, 3rd, and 4th places.

1300
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,930
- Let's start. - I still have a chance.

1301
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,530
Here we go. Ji Hyo.

1302
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,270
- One hour... - One hour...

1303
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:44,340
- five minutes... - five minutes...

1304
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:48,010
- 30 seconds. - 30 seconds. Play the movie.

1305
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,070
(What movie is it this time?)

1306
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,040
It sounds creepy.

1307
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,510
(Is something being dragged?)

1308
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,680
It must be a thriller.

1309
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:04,190
- I'm getting the creeps. - That doesn't help at all.

1310
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:07,430
- It sounded creepy. - Something is being dragged.

1311
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:10,460
- A person might be being chopped. - What are you talking about?

1312
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,860
"Train To Busan"?

1313
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:14,530
You thought someone was eating something, right?

1314
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:16,770
- It's not that. - Haha.

1315
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:17,970
Someone is approaching something.

1316
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,270
1 hour 21 minutes 7 seconds.

1317
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:24,040
- 1 hour 21 minutes 7 seconds. - It'd be near the climax.

1318
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,040
Play the movie.

1319
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,280
- Help! - Soo Yeon.

1320
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,280
(Sisters call each other hurriedly.)

1321
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,520
(And they run.)

1322
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,720
The answer is,

1323
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,790
- "The Host". - That's right.

1324
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,090
No?

1325
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:43,430
- No. - I thought it was right.

1326
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:44,460
"The Host".

1327
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,030
- That's right. - No.

1328
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:48,270
- It's not that one. - I thought it was right.

1329
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:50,200
(It's becoming more and more confusing.)

1330
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,470
5 minutes 15 seconds.

1331
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:54,810
- 5 minutes 15 seconds. - It's the beginning part.

1332
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:57,080
- The movie would have just started. - Play the music.

1333
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:00,510
You haven't even started eating your popcorn by then.

1334
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:04,520
They're driving.

1335
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,720
I picked the wrong part.

1336
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:07,650
I picked the wrong part.

1337
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:09,190
It's a driving scene.

1338
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:11,660
Hold on.

1339
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,660
All I can hear is the rain outside.

1340
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,130
- Is it playing? - Hold on.

1341
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:16,360
- Is it on? - All I can hear is the rain.

1342
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,960
- I can't hear anything. - The rain outside...

1343
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,100
is louder.

1344
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:24,340
You're no better than me.

1345
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:26,370
You have to choose somewhere after an hour.

1346
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,740
- What's your answer? Three, - I might have a chance.

1347
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,040
- two... - My answer is,

1348
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,640
"Inside Men"?

1349
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,810
(Wrong)

1350
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:34,050
- So Min. - I had no choice.

1351
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:35,410
So Min.

1352
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:40,650
1 hour 30 minutes 33 seconds.

1353
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:43,220
1 hour 30 minutes 33 seconds.

1354
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,890
Play the movie.

1355
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,490
(Panting)

1356
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:51,260
(Panting)

1357
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,560
Just hearing the sound is...

1358
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,070
Gosh.

1359
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:56,430
- They don't say anything. - I might have a chance.

1360
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:57,440
(Groaning)

1361
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,040
- I might... - Is this okay?

1362
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,570
Can we air this?

1363
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,980
(My goodness.)

1364
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:09,780
(Is this suitable for broadcasting?)

1365
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:11,580
What will happen?

1366
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,220
Tell us.

1367
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,920
I'd like to hear some more.

1368
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,590
- Just a little bit more. - A little bit more.

1369
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,220
We want to hear more.

1370
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,660
(You'll soon find out.)

1371
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,860
- That was close. - Someone came in.

1372
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,000
- No. - What was that?

1373
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
- It must be a bathroom scene. - A bathroom scene?

1374
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,130
- I think I know it. - Like this.

1375
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:28,500
- What's your answer? - I think I know it.

1376
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,700
(Does Jong Kook know?)

1377
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,270
- What's your answer? - I think I know it.

1378
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:33,140
- Three, - What is it?

1379
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:34,140
- two... - "A Tale of Two Sisters"?

1380
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,410
- I think I know. - "A Tale of Two Sisters"?

1381
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,480
What?

1382
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,740
(Correct)

1383
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:39,980
Really?

1384
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:43,650
(Is it really correct?)

1385
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:46,620
What?

1386
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,350
I knew it from the beginning.

1387
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:50,760
- Because they're sisters? - Because they're sisters.

1388
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,960
- Because they're sisters? - How did you know?

1389
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,990
I thought I'd get this one.

1390
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:56,160
How did you know?

1391
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,600
- I thought I heard Im Soo Jung. - I had no idea.

1392
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,430
- Amazing. - I had no idea.

1393
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:05,200
(It was definitely Im Soo Jung's voice.)

1394
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,770
(The groaning was...)

1395
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:10,240
(from physical exertion.)

1396
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,610
(The members imagined something naughty.)

1397
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,910
It's Jong Kook's turn.

1398
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:19,880
Tell me where you want to play the movie.

1399
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,420
It doesn't take so many turns to get it right.

1400
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,490
One hour.

1401
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,430
10 seconds from 1 hour. Play the movie.

1402
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,360
It's music again.

1403
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:37,000
(Someone is running with beautiful music playing.)

1404
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,170
It's music.

1405
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:39,700
It must be a bed scene.

1406
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:42,640
- It's a train. - How do you know?

1407
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:45,110
- It's a train. - "Don't go." Is it like that?

1408
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,610
- It's a train. - It must be a bed scene.

1409
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,450
- A train is running. - A train...

1410
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:52,220
(If it is a train...)

1411
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:54,590
It's "Galaxy Express 999".

1412
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:57,360
(Could it be "Galaxy Express 999"?)

1413
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:00,430
Are you kidding me? "Galaxy Express 999"?

1414
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,030
"Snowpiercer".

1415
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:04,930
- No. - "Snowpiercer".

1416
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:10,970
It's obviously a Mugunghwa train.

1417
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:13,270
Or it's a Saemaeul train.

1418
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:14,310
(The sound is...)

1419
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:16,510
(from the horses' hoofs.)

1420
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:18,580
(It's from...)

1421
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:24,120
(the movie, "Marathon", featuring Jo Seung Woo.)

1422
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,790
- All right. - Seok Jin.

1423
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:29,490
It was definitely a train.

1424
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,290
- You have to choose the second. - Someone is on a train.

1425
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:32,760
50 minutes 20 seconds.

1426
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:34,460
Play the movie.

1427
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,490
(Kwang Soo and Jong Kook need just one more point.)

1428
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:38,960
(Who will win the midsize meal?)

1429
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:43,370
What is this?

1430
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,310
(They're imagining naughty things again.)

1431
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,970
What's going on?

1432
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,610
- Is it R-rated? - Wait a minute.

1433
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:55,110
- Can this be aired? - What is it?

1434
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:56,180
Goodness.

1435
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:58,080
- Is it R-rated? - Is it basketball?

1436
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,920
This is a big hint.

1437
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,450
Is it in the train?

1438
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:02,690
(What could it be?)

1439
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:05,360
They chased after a train.

1440
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,160
- I know the answer. - Didn't they chase a train?

1441
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:10,230
Which movie is it?

1442
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:12,860
The answer is "Assassination".

1443
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,000
That's not it.

1444
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,700
- It's not a dark movie. - No, it isn't.

1445
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,340
Which movie is it? It's too difficult.

1446
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,940
20 minutes 12 seconds.

1447
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,140
(He picks 20 minutes 12 seconds.)

1448
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:22,610
20 minutes 12 seconds.

1449
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,180
Play the movie.

1450
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,740
I'd be impressed if you guessed right.

1451
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,850
You're very impressive when you run.

1452
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,880
I know the answer.

1453
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,120
(The determining hint is "when you run".)

1454
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,160
(What is his answer?)

1455
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,460
- "Marathon". - That was amazing.

1456
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:41,630
Yes!

1457
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:43,330
(The answer is "Marathon".)

1458
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:47,000
(Kwang Soo wins a midsize Meal Card.)

1459
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,330
(Kwang Soo is lucky today.)

1460
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,340
What happened?

1461
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:52,500
Gosh, he's so lucky.

1462
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,340
- What's going on with you? - What's wrong with you today?

1463
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,610
Are you a ghost?

1464
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:57,180
(Tell us honestly.)

1465
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:58,680
He must be a ghost.

1466
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,910
No matter what I do, you accuse me of being a ghost.

1467
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:02,880
- Goodness. - He must be a ghost.

1468
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:04,180
Now,

1469
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,890
Jae Seok gets a full-course meal.

1470
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:11,290
Kwang Soo, Se Chan, and So Min get a midsize meal.

1471
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:14,460
The remaining four get a small meal.

1472
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,200
Too many get a small meal.

1473
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:20,800
- Janny. - Is there something for me?

1474
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,930
It's a hint.

1475
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:23,030
In 1, 2.

1476
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:24,040
It's an envelope.

1477
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,200
Share the hint with us.

1478
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,610
- It's a hint. - He won't share if he's a ghost.

1479
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:29,240
- He'd share if he isn't. - Right.

1480
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,040
Why wouldn't you share it with us unless you're a ghost?

1481
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,140
(They demand that he shares the hint.)

1482
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,350
(What kind of hint did he get?)

1483
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:37,150
- Wait a minute. - Share it with us.

1484
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:40,220
(There are women among the ghosts.)

1485
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,120
Come on.

1486
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:47,330
(What does the hint say?)

1487
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:49,230
- Tell us. - It's up to you to decide.

1488
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:50,730
- What's wrong? - This is big.

1489
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:52,030
- Tell us. - What does it say?

1490
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:53,700
Gosh, it's big.

1491
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:55,330
What is it?

1492
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:57,600
- It's an individual competition. - I got creeped out.

1493
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:00,340
- Is it that shocking? - Yes.

1494
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:02,640
- Is it specific? - Yes.

1495
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:04,680
Shouldn't he tell us the hint?

1496
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:06,010
We worked together.

1497
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:08,680
It's because Jae Seok is a ghost.

1498
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,020
It's not really shocking.

1499
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:13,950
- What is it? - I can share it with others.

1500
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:16,690
- What is it? - Share it with us.

1501
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:18,220
I can share it with others.

1502
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,790
You should.

1503
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:21,790
Gosh, it's not a helpful hint.

1504
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:24,860
- What is it? - I forgot that I'm a woman.

1505
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,330
(What did he say?)

1506
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:31,570
- What's wrong? - I forgot that I'm a woman.

1507
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:35,670
(Half of the members are women.)

1508
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:37,840
Some ghosts are women.

1509
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,580
- There are women. - I see.

1510
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,410
(Janny and Seok Ja are beautiful women today.)

1511
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:43,010
What's wrong with you, Janny?

1512
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,050
Come on, Janny.

1513
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,990
- A ghost is a woman. - It's not very helpful.

1514
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:49,550
- We have four women. - I'm such a fool.

1515
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:52,120
- That means it's among all of you. - I know.

1516
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,730
We suspected that already.

1517
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:54,990
This is annoying.

1518
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:57,400
Based on that, it's confirmed that he's not a ghost.

1519
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,130
Congratulations.

1520
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,930
He wasn't a ghost after all.

1521
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,700
I'm so annoyed.

1522
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,140
(Which one of them is a ghost?)

1523
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,370
He's human after all.

1524
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,510
Let's forget it and eat.

1525
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:09,510
Okay.

1526
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:11,380
Can you give me some food, Jae Seok?

1527
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,210
What kind of stew is that?

1528
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:14,310
It looks so delicious.

1529
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:15,810
- We can eat it too. - We get sujebi.

1530
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:17,520
- Sujebi is good enough. - Look at the eel.

1531
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,520
It looks delicious.

1532
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,250
I understand why people watch mukbangs.

1533
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,420
We can hear the sound and smell it.

1534
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,150
- It'll be delicious with the broth. - Right.

1535
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:24,560
I dipped it in the broth.

1536
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:26,560
The food is great here.

1537
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:28,390
How is the food?

1538
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:30,160
(Impressed)

1539
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:32,300
The broth is excellent.

1540
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,500
It's so good that I want to offer it to someone.

1541
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,170
I'm not joking. It's delicious.

1542
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,040
Aren't we doing this today?

1543
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,340
What?

1544
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:42,910
What did you say?

1545
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:44,310
(Give me one bite.)

1546
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:47,310
The performance with dried laver is over.

1547
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:48,410
(The business is closed.)

1548
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:50,920
- I'm sorry. - There won't be any performances.

1549
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,320
- That's outdated. - We did it already.

1550
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,720
Why are you repeating what we've done?

1551
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,420
- Hey. - I thought he was doing...

1552
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,120
- Ji Hyo. - something funny.

1553
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:01,090
I'll make us eat in one go. Do you want to share the food?

1554
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:02,530
- How? - In one go.

1555
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:04,030
This will work.

1556
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,430
Today's a day to eat chicken. Here's a chicken.

1557
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:07,430
(He offers a chicken.)

1558
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,700
- Here's a chicken for you. - He's sharing it.

1559
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,400
- This is... - What is that?

1560
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,510
Isn't it too small?

1561
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:14,810
It's because it's a young hen.

1562
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:16,170
- It's too small. - They're easier to eat.

1563
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:17,210
- Can you give me a bigger one? - Have it all.

1564
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:19,680
Would you like some? It's my favorite.

1565
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,110
I saved it for you.

1566
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,910
I'm sorry, but I don't like chicken.

1567
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:24,050
- Is that so? - Yes.

1568
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:25,420
(I'm sorry, Jong Kook.)

1569
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:27,020
(Is that so?)

1570
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,690
- Is that so? - I take that back.

1571
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:30,920
(Did you say you don't like chicken?)

1572
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,190
No, I take that back.

1573
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:36,330
I'll eat it anyway.

1574
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:37,330
It's delicious.

1575
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,160
- It's fresh. - No, it's mine.

1576
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,330
- It's mine. - Don't eat it.

1577
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:41,330
- It's delicious. - Give it to me.

1578
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:42,330
This chicken is delicious.

1579
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:43,330
Don't be angry.

1580
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:44,670
- I love chicken. - Okay.

1581
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,600
Jong Kook, you succeeded.

1582
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,170
Really? What will you give me?

1583
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:50,140
- He can't do that. - Getting food wasn't my intention.

1584
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:51,410
Are you doing something, Haha?

1585
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:55,010
- Is he Jung Dong Nam? - I'm Jung Dong Nam.

1586
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:59,180
(Haha puts on a performance.)

1587
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:02,420
He's exactly like him.

1588
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:03,520
- He deserves it. - He's exactly like him.

1589
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,260
Bring me your bowl.

1590
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,890
- That was impressive. - Thank you.

1591
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:08,290
- Goodness. - Excuse me.

1592
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:10,260
Could you pay attention?

1593
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:11,630
Give him some sujebi.

1594
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,470
What have you prepared?

1595
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,530
Gosh, it's embarrassing.

1596
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:18,700
Gosh, it's embarrassing.

1597
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,010
- Let's think. - What was that?

1598
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:23,510
(They feel sorry for her.)

1599
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:25,580
Can you be more committed to it?

1600
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:28,610
You put too much trust in Seok Jin.

1601
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:29,880
Are you starting a fight with him?

1602
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,350
- You shouldn't trust him. - You promised.

1603
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:33,690
Ji Hyo.

1604
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:36,120
(Ji Hyo becomes pathetic because of Seok Jin.)

1605
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,520
- Ji Hyo, I have an amazing idea. - What?

1606
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,690
(Believe me, Ji Hyo.)

1607
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:46,560
- I did it, Jae Seok. - What?

1608
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,630
- It's a dried laver facial mask. - That's great.

1609
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:51,670
She fails again.

1610
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,670
(They feel sorry for her again.)

1611
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:55,170
You're making me lose my appetite.

1612
00:58:55,710 --> 00:58:58,110
- You said it'd work. - You're making me lose my appetite.

1613
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,110
(Hitting)

1614
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:01,510
(You said the dried laver facial mask would work.)

1615
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:03,310
- Ji Hyo. - You said it'd work.

1616
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:04,680
Ji Hyo.

1617
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,120
- You promised. - I like what you did.

1618
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,620
It was realistic.

1619
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,690
That was great, Ji Hyo.

1620
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:12,690
I liked the sound when she hit his head.

1621
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,690
It's his first time being hit like that in 40 years.

1622
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:16,800
The sound was loud.

1623
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,887
I haven't heard such realistic sound in a while.

1624
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,030
(Who's really a ghost?)

1625
00:59:20,587 --> 00:59:24,127
(It's nighttime.)

1626
00:59:25,467 --> 00:59:27,327
(M University)

1627
00:59:28,797 --> 00:59:31,537
(It starts...)

1628
00:59:31,537 --> 00:59:34,607
(at a deserted school.)

1629
00:59:34,607 --> 00:59:37,106
The final mission is called...

1630
00:59:37,419 --> 00:59:39,759
Escape Mystery Thriller Race.

1631
00:59:39,759 --> 00:59:41,459
- Really? - It's an escape.

1632
00:59:41,459 --> 00:59:42,859
(Escape Mystery Thriller Race)

1633
00:59:42,859 --> 00:59:44,159
It's Escape Mystery Thriller Race.

1634
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:49,069
(It's the last chance to find out the secret couple.)

1635
00:59:49,869 --> 00:59:51,469
Once you enter the building,

1636
00:59:51,469 --> 00:59:54,569
the doors will close immediately.

1637
00:59:54,769 --> 00:59:57,169
You have the chance to escape...

1638
00:59:57,339 --> 01:00:00,279
when the door opens once for five minutes.

1639
01:00:00,279 --> 01:00:01,309
Only once?

1640
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:05,219
If two humans escape, humans win.

1641
01:00:05,319 --> 01:00:08,989
If one of them is a ghost, the ghosts win.

1642
01:00:08,989 --> 01:00:16,459
(The two who escape must be human for humans to win.)

1643
01:00:16,459 --> 01:00:19,829
During the race, humans can eliminate...

1644
01:00:19,829 --> 01:00:22,229
the ghosts by tearing off their name tags.

1645
01:00:22,229 --> 01:00:27,969
(Humans can eliminate the ghosts by tearing off their name tags.)

1646
01:00:27,969 --> 01:00:29,469
The ghosts can't tear off name tags.

1647
01:00:29,509 --> 01:00:32,079
Right, but if a human tears off a name tag...

1648
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:35,149
of another human, humans lose immediately.

1649
01:00:35,149 --> 01:00:37,349
(They must eliminate only the ghosts.)

1650
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:38,519
It requires thinking.

1651
01:00:38,519 --> 01:00:40,519
Isn't the chance too low to win?

1652
01:00:40,519 --> 01:00:44,119
You may guess other members' identities based on the hints.

1653
01:00:44,289 --> 01:00:46,819
You may find out by going on the ghost elevator.

1654
01:00:46,819 --> 01:00:48,289
- What's that? - What is it?

1655
01:00:48,289 --> 01:00:49,459
(There's a ghost elevator.)

1656
01:00:50,059 --> 01:00:53,029
The ghost elevator operates when three people are in it.

1657
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:57,099
If 2 of them are ghosts, the elevator stops on the 4th floor.

1658
01:00:57,099 --> 01:01:01,169
(If 2 of them are ghosts, the elevator stops on the 4th floor.)

1659
01:01:01,169 --> 01:01:03,109
(It's a chance to determine the ghosts.)

1660
01:01:03,109 --> 01:01:05,109
- Two ghosts? - This is scary.

1661
01:01:05,109 --> 01:01:07,339
- Isn't this too scary? - It's really scary.

1662
01:01:07,339 --> 01:01:10,679
Is it okay if only one of them is a ghost?

1663
01:01:10,779 --> 01:01:12,749
It'd be scary if it stopped on the fourth floor.

1664
01:01:12,979 --> 01:01:15,249
- Goodness. - 1, 2, 3, 4, open.

1665
01:01:15,289 --> 01:01:18,659
When you can use the elevator will be announced.

1666
01:01:18,659 --> 01:01:22,829
Only the three members who arrive first may use the elevator.

1667
01:01:22,829 --> 01:01:25,459
If you get on the elevator, you can find out who the ghosts are.

1668
01:01:25,459 --> 01:01:27,199
- You can find out. - We'd find out then.

1669
01:01:27,459 --> 01:01:31,569
Escape Mystery Thriller Race begins now.

1670
01:01:31,569 --> 01:01:33,139
- Okay. - Okay.

1671
01:01:33,139 --> 01:01:34,169
It's a thriller.

1672
01:01:36,869 --> 01:01:39,079
Jong Kook seems suspicious.

1673
01:01:39,179 --> 01:01:40,979
Jong Kook...

1674
01:01:42,179 --> 01:01:45,049
gets angry no matter what.

1675
01:01:45,879 --> 01:01:47,689
He has a strange mentality.

1676
01:01:48,089 --> 01:01:50,049
- I can't tell. - What I said was correct.

1677
01:01:50,049 --> 01:01:51,789
We should beat him up.

1678
01:01:52,189 --> 01:01:53,259
I know.

1679
01:01:53,259 --> 01:01:55,159
We can work as a team.

1680
01:01:55,459 --> 01:01:57,029
It's possible with the three of us.

1681
01:01:58,129 --> 01:02:00,229
(Are you sure it's possible?)

1682
01:02:00,459 --> 01:02:02,429
I think Ji Hyo is a ghost.

1683
01:02:02,429 --> 01:02:04,469
So Min might be a ghost too.

1684
01:02:04,469 --> 01:02:05,639
(Everyone thinks Ji Hyo is a ghost.)

1685
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,909
Why does everyone think I am a ghost?

1686
01:02:08,739 --> 01:02:10,469
I think it might be...

1687
01:02:10,569 --> 01:02:12,009
Seok Jin...

1688
01:02:12,009 --> 01:02:15,649
(Ji Hyo is suspicious of Seok Jin...)

1689
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:16,749
or So Min.

1690
01:02:16,749 --> 01:02:18,049
(Ji Hyo is suspicious of Seok Jin and So Min.)

1691
01:02:18,779 --> 01:02:21,589
(She makes scary sounds.)

1692
01:02:21,589 --> 01:02:24,519
(A ghost or not, she is crazy.)

1693
01:02:25,189 --> 01:02:27,789
(Meanwhile...)

1694
01:02:31,259 --> 01:02:33,359
(Sighing)

1695
01:02:34,499 --> 01:02:36,629
I don't think anyone is suspicious of me.

1696
01:02:39,299 --> 01:02:40,639
Who is the other ghost?

1697
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:43,469
(Who is the other ghost?)

1698
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:46,079
Please check your identity in secret.

1699
01:02:46,809 --> 01:02:50,309
(Jae Seok's identity was...)

1700
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:56,389
(a ghost.)

1701
01:02:56,389 --> 01:02:57,489
My goodness.

1702
01:03:00,619 --> 01:03:04,899
(He is at the final race.)

1703
01:03:04,899 --> 01:03:09,129
If I make a mistake and get branded as a ghost,

1704
01:03:09,299 --> 01:03:11,169
I will end up roaming the Earth forever.

1705
01:03:12,399 --> 01:03:13,699
You need to do well.

1706
01:03:13,869 --> 01:03:16,509
If we make a mistake, we will end up roaming the Earth forever.

1707
01:03:17,609 --> 01:03:18,939
We need to move onto the afterlife.

1708
01:03:18,939 --> 01:03:21,979
(He needs to lure a human being and escape.)

1709
01:03:23,309 --> 01:03:25,319
The race will start now.

1710
01:03:25,319 --> 01:03:26,579
(They get ready for the race.)

1711
01:03:28,189 --> 01:03:29,289
In five,

1712
01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:30,389
four,

1713
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:31,589
three,

1714
01:03:31,589 --> 01:03:32,689
two,

1715
01:03:32,689 --> 01:03:33,719
one.

1716
01:03:33,719 --> 01:03:35,729
- The race begins. - Let's go.

1717
01:03:37,459 --> 01:03:38,599
My goodness.

1718
01:03:38,759 --> 01:03:40,429
Let's look for hints.

1719
01:03:40,429 --> 01:03:41,569
Okay.

1720
01:03:42,099 --> 01:03:43,199
Se Chan.

1721
01:03:43,469 --> 01:03:45,039
Okay.

1722
01:03:45,769 --> 01:03:47,139
The race starts.

1723
01:03:47,139 --> 01:03:49,909
(Ghosts versus humans. How will the final race end?)

1724
01:03:51,009 --> 01:03:53,009
It's important to find the hints quickly.

1725
01:03:54,479 --> 01:03:55,709
I need to find them quickly.

1726
01:03:55,709 --> 01:03:57,109
Are there different sets of hints...

1727
01:03:57,449 --> 01:03:59,779
for ghosts and humans?

1728
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:02,149
The humans win if they escape together.

1729
01:04:02,149 --> 01:04:03,589
Who are the humans?

1730
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:04,889
(The humans win if they escape together.)

1731
01:04:04,889 --> 01:04:06,289
I need to find them.

1732
01:04:06,489 --> 01:04:08,059
I need to know...

1733
01:04:09,029 --> 01:04:10,999
I need to know who the humans are.

1734
01:04:10,999 --> 01:04:11,999
(The ghosts win if a human and a ghost escape.)

1735
01:04:12,499 --> 01:04:13,559
I am scared.

1736
01:04:15,529 --> 01:04:19,299
(Who is the other ghost?)

1737
01:04:19,569 --> 01:04:22,309
I am famous for being terrible at finding hints.

1738
01:04:26,209 --> 01:04:30,009
(He finds a hint.)

1739
01:04:30,009 --> 01:04:31,119
My goodness.

1740
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:33,179
My goodness.

1741
01:04:33,179 --> 01:04:39,589
(There is a comedian among the ghosts.)

1742
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:41,389
It could have been disastrous.

1743
01:04:41,389 --> 01:04:42,689
(It's a hint about me.)

1744
01:04:42,689 --> 01:04:44,929
"There is a comedian among the ghosts."

1745
01:04:45,629 --> 01:04:46,659
My goodness.

1746
01:04:48,299 --> 01:04:50,999
(He discards the hint right away.)

1747
01:04:54,039 --> 01:04:56,809
- Did you find a hint? - Yes.

1748
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:57,909
What does it say?

1749
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:00,079
I can't tell you.

1750
01:05:00,979 --> 01:05:02,009
(It's a crucial hint.)

1751
01:05:02,009 --> 01:05:03,279
I can't tell you already.

1752
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:05,279
Do you want to be penalized?

1753
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:07,519
At this rate, you will receive a penalty.

1754
01:05:07,889 --> 01:05:10,619
Let's focus on finding as many hints as possible.

1755
01:05:11,389 --> 01:05:13,389
- Did you find anything? - Not yet.

1756
01:05:13,459 --> 01:05:15,189
Is it a crucial hint?

1757
01:05:15,429 --> 01:05:16,529
No.

1758
01:05:17,189 --> 01:05:20,899
(It's just that the only comedians are Seok Jin, Se Chan, and me.)

1759
01:05:22,569 --> 01:05:24,169
Isn't this hint...

1760
01:05:24,439 --> 01:05:26,069
too crucial?

1761
01:05:26,369 --> 01:05:28,269
It's like giving away the answer.

1762
01:05:30,169 --> 01:05:33,979
(Where are you, hints?)

1763
01:05:34,909 --> 01:05:36,449
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1764
01:05:36,449 --> 01:05:37,619
Kwang Soo, come here for a second.

1765
01:05:37,779 --> 01:05:39,419
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1766
01:05:39,419 --> 01:05:40,519
Kwang Soo, come here for a second.

1767
01:05:40,849 --> 01:05:42,319
(Se Chan calls for Kwang Soo with urgency.)

1768
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:43,349
What is it?

1769
01:05:45,419 --> 01:05:49,589
(Does he have an important hint?)

1770
01:05:50,059 --> 01:05:51,459
For goodness' sake.

1771
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:55,229
(Are you scared?)

1772
01:05:55,229 --> 01:05:56,299
For goodness' sake.

1773
01:05:57,569 --> 01:05:58,999
(It's fun to pull a prank on Kwang Soo.)

1774
01:05:58,999 --> 01:06:00,099
Are we allowed to go upstairs?

1775
01:06:00,369 --> 01:06:04,139
Kwang Soo is scared.

1776
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:07,179
(Did you think I was done?)

1777
01:06:07,179 --> 01:06:08,279
Stop it.

1778
01:06:08,279 --> 01:06:10,449
(Did you think I was done?)

1779
01:06:10,449 --> 01:06:13,949
I will hit you before the end of the race,

1780
01:06:14,149 --> 01:06:15,819
- okay? - I am playing a ghost.

1781
01:06:16,049 --> 01:06:17,859
That's the concept of the race.

1782
01:06:19,489 --> 01:06:21,629
(He continues to annoy Kwang Soo.)

1783
01:06:21,629 --> 01:06:22,889
For goodness' sake.

1784
01:06:23,459 --> 01:06:26,399
Do you think I will be scared?

1785
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:27,399
(The long one and the annoying one)

1786
01:06:27,399 --> 01:06:28,769
What is your problem?

1787
01:06:30,669 --> 01:06:32,799
Aren't the ghosts at a disadvantage?

1788
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,839
(Janny is looking for hints.)

1789
01:06:34,839 --> 01:06:36,109
These lockers are empty.

1790
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,479
(He finds another hint.)

1791
01:06:43,449 --> 01:06:44,849
(He finds it before Jong Kook does.)

1792
01:06:44,849 --> 01:06:46,219
My goodness.

1793
01:06:48,889 --> 01:06:51,359
(Running)

1794
01:06:53,189 --> 01:06:55,259
(What is the hint?)

1795
01:06:55,259 --> 01:06:56,589
It must be a hint regarding the humans.

1796
01:06:58,959 --> 01:07:03,399
(There is a man among the humans.)

1797
01:07:03,399 --> 01:07:05,399
What is this?

1798
01:07:06,699 --> 01:07:07,939
What kind of a hint is this?

1799
01:07:08,439 --> 01:07:10,739
"There is a man among the humans"?

1800
01:07:10,879 --> 01:07:12,479
For goodness' sake.

1801
01:07:12,809 --> 01:07:14,609
What kind of a hint is this?

1802
01:07:14,609 --> 01:07:15,879
(Hints on the humans are very vague.)

1803
01:07:15,879 --> 01:07:17,449
For goodness' sake.

1804
01:07:18,919 --> 01:07:20,849
I am scared. Why am I so scared today?

1805
01:07:20,849 --> 01:07:23,319
The ghost elevator has opened.

1806
01:07:24,859 --> 01:07:29,589
(The ghost elevator has opened.)

1807
01:07:30,689 --> 01:07:34,899
(The ghost elevator operates when there are 3 passengers.)

1808
01:07:34,899 --> 01:07:39,899
(If 2 passengers are ghosts, the door opens on the 4th floor.)

1809
01:07:39,899 --> 01:07:41,169
(Ghost elevator)

1810
01:07:41,509 --> 01:07:43,639
(It's a good chance to identify the ghosts and humans.)

1811
01:07:43,639 --> 01:07:46,109
The ghost elevator has opened.

1812
01:07:46,309 --> 01:07:49,279
The three members who arrive first may use the elevator.

1813
01:07:49,279 --> 01:07:51,519
(Only those who run can get on the elevator.)

1814
01:07:52,219 --> 01:07:56,019
The three members who arrive first may use the elevator.

1815
01:07:57,419 --> 01:07:59,219
(Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Kwang Soo, and Jong Kook head to the elevator.)

1816
01:07:59,219 --> 01:08:00,319
Let's go.

1817
01:08:04,059 --> 01:08:05,829
- Seok Jin. - Are you getting in?

1818
01:08:05,829 --> 01:08:07,199
- Of course, I am. - Let's go.

1819
01:08:07,299 --> 01:08:08,529
We need one more person.

1820
01:08:08,629 --> 01:08:09,769
I am here.

1821
01:08:10,069 --> 01:08:12,539
Those who have a high chance of being a ghost should get in.

1822
01:08:12,539 --> 01:08:14,939
- There are 3 people. - 3 passengers have arrived.

1823
01:08:15,009 --> 01:08:16,839
Please get into the elevator.

1824
01:08:17,239 --> 01:08:18,679
Please get into the elevator.

1825
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:23,449
(Jae Seok, Seok Jin, and Kwang Soo enter the ghost elevator.)

1826
01:08:23,709 --> 01:08:24,779
Wait a minute.

1827
01:08:24,779 --> 01:08:26,879
I will know if I watch from here.

1828
01:08:26,879 --> 01:08:28,319
I will see if it stops...

1829
01:08:28,449 --> 01:08:30,219
at the fourth floor.

1830
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:31,789
- Let's go to the 5th floor. - It's heading to the 5th floor.

1831
01:08:31,789 --> 01:08:33,459
If it stops on the fourth floor, both of you are ghosts.

1832
01:08:33,459 --> 01:08:35,129
- What? - It means both of you are ghosts.

1833
01:08:35,129 --> 01:08:37,489
If it stops on the fourth floor, both of you are ghosts.

1834
01:08:37,489 --> 01:08:39,199
If it stops on the fifth floor, only one of us is a ghost.

1835
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:44,199
(If 2 out of the 3 passengers are ghosts,)

1836
01:08:44,199 --> 01:08:48,539
(the door will open on the 4th floor.)

1837
01:08:48,539 --> 01:08:53,739
(It's time to see if it will open on the 4th floor.)

1838
01:08:54,679 --> 01:08:56,649
My goodness, it stopped.

1839
01:08:57,519 --> 01:09:00,619
(The door opens.)

1840
01:09:01,889 --> 01:09:02,989
I got goosebumps.

1841
01:09:03,749 --> 01:09:04,789
My goodness.

1842
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:05,959
No way!

1843
01:09:06,489 --> 01:09:14,499
(That means there are two ghosts.)

1844
01:09:16,029 --> 01:09:18,699
- That means there are 2 ghosts. - 2 of us are ghosts.

1845
01:09:18,699 --> 01:09:20,099
(The other ghost is Kwang Soo or Seok Jin.)

1846
01:09:20,099 --> 01:09:22,439
- This is insane. - This is insane.

1847
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:24,339
(The other ghost is Kwang Soo or Seok Jin.)

1848
01:09:25,739 --> 01:09:27,209
Did it stop on the fourth floor?

1849
01:09:28,149 --> 01:09:29,349
So two of them are ghosts?

1850
01:09:29,509 --> 01:09:31,019
It seems like the elevator stopped on the fourth floor.

1851
01:09:31,019 --> 01:09:33,479
(Everyone freaks out.)

1852
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:34,889
- It stopped on the fourth floor. - Who were in the elevator?

1853
01:09:34,889 --> 01:09:36,019
- I don't know. - Who were in the elevator?

1854
01:09:36,019 --> 01:09:37,119
What is going on?

1855
01:09:37,449 --> 01:09:38,489
Are you ghosts?

1856
01:09:38,489 --> 01:09:40,589
- For goodness' sake. - Wait a minute.

1857
01:09:40,819 --> 01:09:42,059
- Are you ghosts? - My goodness.

1858
01:09:43,159 --> 01:09:45,299
I got goosebumps.

1859
01:09:45,899 --> 01:09:47,029
What happened?

1860
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:48,999
What is it?

1861
01:09:48,999 --> 01:09:50,869
The two of them are ghosts.

1862
01:09:50,999 --> 01:09:52,339
They are ghosts.

1863
01:09:52,339 --> 01:09:53,969
They are ghosts.

1864
01:09:54,069 --> 01:09:55,309
I am not a ghost.

1865
01:09:55,469 --> 01:09:57,439
- They are ghosts. - I am scared.

1866
01:09:57,439 --> 01:09:59,679
Does that mean there are two ghosts among you?

1867
01:09:59,739 --> 01:10:01,779
- It stopped on the fourth floor. - Then two of you are ghosts.

1868
01:10:01,779 --> 01:10:05,149
Seok Jin, Kwang Soo, and I were in the elevator.

1869
01:10:05,919 --> 01:10:07,889
- I am serious when I say this. - The three of you were in it.

1870
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:09,849
Kwang Soo and Jae Seok are ghosts.

1871
01:10:09,849 --> 01:10:11,019
I am not a ghost.

1872
01:10:11,019 --> 01:10:13,059
Kwang Soo has to be a ghost.

1873
01:10:13,059 --> 01:10:14,119
(Kwang Soo is always the number 1 pick.)

1874
01:10:14,119 --> 01:10:16,129
- I am not a ghost! - Yes, you are.

1875
01:10:16,889 --> 01:10:21,999
(Who is the other ghost?)

1876
01:10:23,329 --> 01:10:25,599
(After the incident at the ghost elevator)

1877
01:10:27,299 --> 01:10:28,809
This is driving me crazy.

1878
01:10:30,409 --> 01:10:31,809
I need more hints.

1879
01:10:31,809 --> 01:10:32,979
(Between Seok Jin and Kwang Soo, who is the ghost?)

1880
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:34,449
I need to find more hints.

1881
01:10:34,449 --> 01:10:36,049
(Between Seok Jin and Kwang Soo, who is the ghost?)

1882
01:10:39,079 --> 01:10:41,549
(Looking around)

1883
01:10:41,549 --> 01:10:44,389
(He finds a hint.)

1884
01:10:45,959 --> 01:10:47,319
(Let's hide first.)

1885
01:10:49,759 --> 01:10:51,129
What?

1886
01:10:51,129 --> 01:10:54,299
(There is a singer among the ghosts.)

1887
01:10:55,499 --> 01:10:57,099
"There is a comedian among the ghosts."

1888
01:10:57,799 --> 01:10:59,369
"There is a singer among the ghosts."

1889
01:11:00,169 --> 01:11:01,409
Wait a minute.

1890
01:11:02,109 --> 01:11:03,139
This is...

1891
01:11:04,179 --> 01:11:06,239
(That means...)

1892
01:11:07,239 --> 01:11:09,049
(Seok Jin meets both conditions.)

1893
01:11:09,049 --> 01:11:10,409
Wait a minute.

1894
01:11:11,349 --> 01:11:12,919
If three pairs escape.

1895
01:11:12,919 --> 01:11:14,489
(Is Seok Jin the most likely to be a ghost?)

1896
01:11:14,489 --> 01:11:16,549
One person will be left.

1897
01:11:19,919 --> 01:11:21,489
- What is it? - Are you a ghost or not?

1898
01:11:21,629 --> 01:11:23,159
I am human.

1899
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:24,259
Are you really?

1900
01:11:25,729 --> 01:11:27,899
Which hint did you find?

1901
01:11:28,299 --> 01:11:29,929
Think about it.

1902
01:11:29,929 --> 01:11:32,499
- It's crystal clear. - Then remove Jae Seok's name tag.

1903
01:11:32,539 --> 01:11:37,039
(Then remove Jae Seok's name tag.)

1904
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:38,879
- The hint I found... - That's a bit...

1905
01:11:38,879 --> 01:11:40,609
The hint I found...

1906
01:11:40,609 --> 01:11:43,049
suggests either you or Jae Seok is a ghost.

1907
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:45,319
(Does the hint Ji Hyo found point to Janny and Seok Ja?)

1908
01:11:45,319 --> 01:11:46,649
Isn't this a hint?

1909
01:11:47,419 --> 01:11:49,719
(A moment ago, Ji Hyo found a ghost-related hint.)

1910
01:11:49,719 --> 01:11:50,889
This is incredible.

1911
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:53,159
(A moment ago, Ji Hyo found a ghost-related hint.)

1912
01:11:53,389 --> 01:11:55,329
"One of the ghosts is wearing glasses."

1913
01:11:55,329 --> 01:11:57,559
(One of the ghosts is wearing glasses.)

1914
01:11:58,959 --> 01:12:00,299
It's either you or Jae Seok.

1915
01:12:00,869 --> 01:12:02,169
I know for certain.

1916
01:12:02,729 --> 01:12:04,369
You're wrong.

1917
01:12:06,539 --> 01:12:07,669
Jae Seok is here.

1918
01:12:07,669 --> 01:12:09,869
(Be quiet.)

1919
01:12:10,339 --> 01:12:11,509
Jae Seok is here.

1920
01:12:11,639 --> 01:12:13,409
- Prove to me that it's not you. - What?

1921
01:12:13,509 --> 01:12:16,579
- If it's not you, rip his name tag. - This will end too quickly.

1922
01:12:16,579 --> 01:12:19,119
- What? - Everything will end.

1923
01:12:19,449 --> 01:12:20,649
It won't be fun.

1924
01:12:21,149 --> 01:12:22,449
- Seok Jin. - What?

1925
01:12:22,449 --> 01:12:23,849
You're a ghost.

1926
01:12:25,519 --> 01:12:27,259
I'm human.

1927
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:28,729
If you know that...

1928
01:12:29,189 --> 01:12:31,499
the other person is the ghost, why won't you rip their name tag?

1929
01:12:31,599 --> 01:12:32,699
That's not true.

1930
01:12:33,259 --> 01:12:35,099
- Everybody. - Listen.

1931
01:12:35,099 --> 01:12:37,199
(Can you look at this?)

1932
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:39,899
"One of the ghosts is a singer."

1933
01:12:40,839 --> 01:12:44,939
(If that's the hint, Seok Jin has to be the ghost.)

1934
01:12:44,939 --> 01:12:46,509
You get it, right?

1935
01:12:46,539 --> 01:12:49,579
Rip it. Rip my name tag.

1936
01:12:50,009 --> 01:12:54,149
He's a singer too. He released so many albums.

1937
01:12:54,149 --> 01:12:55,919
Me...

1938
01:12:55,919 --> 01:12:57,389
See?

1939
01:12:57,389 --> 01:13:00,259
- Are you flustered? - Why are you stuttering?

1940
01:13:00,259 --> 01:13:01,529
I'm a comedian.

1941
01:13:01,889 --> 01:13:05,399
Me too.

1942
01:13:07,159 --> 01:13:10,099
(Is that how you like to play this?)

1943
01:13:10,229 --> 01:13:13,839
- What's that? - There's a comedian too.

1944
01:13:13,839 --> 01:13:14,839
(Ta-da)

1945
01:13:14,839 --> 01:13:16,169
What's that?

1946
01:13:16,169 --> 01:13:18,409
You just said you're a comedian.

1947
01:13:18,409 --> 01:13:19,939
- That's you. - See?

1948
01:13:19,939 --> 01:13:22,379
Look.

1949
01:13:22,379 --> 01:13:24,419
- You're so shameless. - Watch.

1950
01:13:24,419 --> 01:13:25,619
- You're a comedian. - You're a singer...

1951
01:13:25,619 --> 01:13:28,449
You released an album. You're on the music chart.

1952
01:13:28,589 --> 01:13:30,149
Seok Jin.

1953
01:13:30,149 --> 01:13:31,289
Rip it.

1954
01:13:31,289 --> 01:13:32,289
Can I?

1955
01:13:34,389 --> 01:13:38,129
(At the same time)

1956
01:13:41,469 --> 01:13:43,369
(Haha finds a hint after a long time.)

1957
01:13:45,099 --> 01:13:48,909
(Let me see.)

1958
01:13:48,909 --> 01:13:50,569
(Thinking)

1959
01:13:52,179 --> 01:13:56,179
(There's a ghost who has an older brother.)

1960
01:13:56,179 --> 01:13:59,019
Kwang Soo is the oldest child. So is Jae Seok.

1961
01:13:59,249 --> 01:14:02,349
Does Seok Jin have an older brother? He does.

1962
01:14:04,089 --> 01:14:05,889
Seok Jin has an older brother.

1963
01:14:06,489 --> 01:14:07,889
I remember saying that to him.

1964
01:14:07,889 --> 01:14:10,189
I asked if his brother was older than him, how old he'd be.

1965
01:14:12,599 --> 01:14:14,399
Don't be too preoccupied with me.

1966
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,969
- All the hints I have... - I'm human.

1967
01:14:15,969 --> 01:14:18,369
point to you.

1968
01:14:18,739 --> 01:14:20,339
It's Jae Seok.

1969
01:14:20,339 --> 01:14:21,809
- Come here. - Why?

1970
01:14:21,809 --> 01:14:22,809
Hurry.

1971
01:14:22,909 --> 01:14:24,439
- Hey. - You ghost.

1972
01:14:24,609 --> 01:14:27,379
You're a ghost. Stop pretending to be human.

1973
01:14:27,579 --> 01:14:30,049
- It's not me. This is wrong. - Come here.

1974
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:32,319
That's up to me to decide.

1975
01:14:33,479 --> 01:14:35,649
You got it all wrong. What are you doing?

1976
01:14:35,649 --> 01:14:37,389
(Calm down.)

1977
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:41,459
(Ripping)

1978
01:14:41,459 --> 01:14:44,299
(She rips his name tag.)

1979
01:14:44,299 --> 01:14:45,629
Turn around, Seok Jin.

1980
01:14:47,429 --> 01:14:49,329
- He has to be the ghost. - For sure.

1981
01:14:49,329 --> 01:14:50,669
If that hint is right,

1982
01:14:51,399 --> 01:14:53,839
- you can rip my name tag. - Seok Jin is out.

1983
01:14:53,839 --> 01:14:55,639
- Seok Jin is out. - What?

1984
01:14:58,309 --> 01:15:03,409
Seok Jin is out. Ghost Seok Jin...

1985
01:15:05,349 --> 01:15:06,819
- is out. - Right.

1986
01:15:07,357 --> 01:15:09,957
I said it was Seok Jin because...

1987
01:15:10,697 --> 01:15:14,437
my hint said the ghost had an older brother.

1988
01:15:14,697 --> 01:15:17,067
- You're a ghost. - So you're human.

1989
01:15:17,067 --> 01:15:18,107
(Seok Jin was a ghost.)

1990
01:15:18,107 --> 01:15:20,537
(Ji Hyo eliminates the first ghost.)

1991
01:15:20,537 --> 01:15:24,777
- I told you I'm human. - Seok Jin is out.

1992
01:15:24,907 --> 01:15:27,547
Ghost Seok Jin is out.

1993
01:15:27,547 --> 01:15:28,747
It is him.

1994
01:15:28,747 --> 01:15:30,787
(He thought so.)

1995
01:15:30,787 --> 01:15:33,147
I was right. He is a ghost.

1996
01:15:33,717 --> 01:15:36,487
I have to survive by myself.

1997
01:15:41,657 --> 01:15:44,897
(Jae Seok is the only ghost left. He searches for humans.)

1998
01:15:45,097 --> 01:15:46,367
I have to find it quickly.

1999
01:15:46,367 --> 01:15:48,167
(The other members are busy looking for hints.)

2000
01:15:48,167 --> 01:15:50,597
Oh, gosh.

2001
01:15:51,407 --> 01:15:52,607
- Kwang Soo. - What?

2002
01:15:52,607 --> 01:15:56,277
I don't understand the rules, so you can carry on.

2003
01:15:57,207 --> 01:15:59,647
(Hissing)

2004
01:15:59,747 --> 01:16:01,317
Hey.

2005
01:16:01,317 --> 01:16:03,917
- Hey, Se Chan. - Sorry. Don't rip my name tag.

2006
01:16:03,917 --> 01:16:05,247
- You... - That was the end.

2007
01:16:05,617 --> 01:16:06,917
I'll stop.

2008
01:16:06,917 --> 01:16:09,787
- I'm sorry, Kwang Soo. - Fine.

2009
01:16:10,517 --> 01:16:11,687
(I'll let you go this time.)

2010
01:16:12,327 --> 01:16:15,557
(He makes ghost sounds again.)

2011
01:16:15,557 --> 01:16:16,927
Fine.

2012
01:16:16,927 --> 01:16:18,167
You're not scary.

2013
01:16:18,167 --> 01:16:19,397
(I'm not scared at all.)

2014
01:16:19,397 --> 01:16:20,427
Okay.

2015
01:16:21,097 --> 01:16:23,837
What I'm wondering is...

2016
01:16:24,067 --> 01:16:25,137
What?

2017
01:16:25,337 --> 01:16:29,537
(What?)

2018
01:16:29,537 --> 01:16:32,547
(Haha finds another hint.)

2019
01:16:35,947 --> 01:16:38,987
I want to know if it's a male or a female.

2020
01:16:40,547 --> 01:16:44,257
(What is Haha's hint?)

2021
01:16:44,257 --> 01:16:45,427
What?

2022
01:16:45,427 --> 01:16:47,697
(What?)

2023
01:16:47,697 --> 01:16:51,667
(What is this?)

2024
01:16:52,997 --> 01:16:56,537
This world is filled with insecurity.

2025
01:16:57,967 --> 01:17:00,537
(What? What's that?)

2026
01:17:00,537 --> 01:17:02,237
Whom should I trust?

2027
01:17:03,977 --> 01:17:05,177
Oh, my.

2028
01:17:07,847 --> 01:17:09,317
I need to trust the hints.

2029
01:17:09,317 --> 01:17:10,817
(Ji Hyo accidentally finds a hint.)

2030
01:17:10,817 --> 01:17:11,947
What's this?

2031
01:17:12,517 --> 01:17:16,217
(It's a little bit different.)

2032
01:17:16,517 --> 01:17:18,087
"If you would like a hint,"

2033
01:17:18,427 --> 01:17:21,327
"call the class leader." Who's the class leader?

2034
01:17:21,327 --> 01:17:23,927
(The class leader?)

2035
01:17:24,727 --> 01:17:27,537
(Earlier today)

2036
01:17:27,537 --> 01:17:29,697
(They got a call from the class leader.)

2037
01:17:29,697 --> 01:17:32,907
(You need to call him back?)

2038
01:17:34,907 --> 01:17:38,447
(Let me hide first.)

2039
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:41,517
(Please pick up.)

2040
01:17:52,287 --> 01:17:53,687
What's wrong with you?

2041
01:17:53,887 --> 01:17:55,457
Look at him.

2042
01:17:55,727 --> 01:17:56,997
I didn't see you.

2043
01:17:58,427 --> 01:18:00,027
Hey, Janny.

2044
01:18:00,167 --> 01:18:01,937
- Hey. - Janny.

2045
01:18:01,937 --> 01:18:03,037
Really?

2046
01:18:03,237 --> 01:18:05,437
- Ji Hyo. - What?

2047
01:18:05,437 --> 01:18:06,667
How could you do this to me?

2048
01:18:06,667 --> 01:18:08,837
What is wrong with you? Why are you being so clingy?

2049
01:18:08,837 --> 01:18:09,907
- I told you. - No.

2050
01:18:09,907 --> 01:18:11,377
We have to escape together.

2051
01:18:11,377 --> 01:18:13,307
Okay. We still have time.

2052
01:18:13,307 --> 01:18:15,017
But you just got a hint.

2053
01:18:15,017 --> 01:18:17,417
- Yes, I did. - Can you share it with me?

2054
01:18:18,147 --> 01:18:21,487
No, I was calling,

2055
01:18:21,487 --> 01:18:23,717
and I saw you. Let me call first.

2056
01:18:23,717 --> 01:18:25,157
- Give me the hint. - Okay.

2057
01:18:25,157 --> 01:18:27,927
- My gosh. Jenny... I mean... - Hold on.

2058
01:18:28,057 --> 01:18:30,257
- Check it, and let's get out. - Okay.

2059
01:18:32,097 --> 01:18:34,967
(What's that phone about?)

2060
01:18:34,967 --> 01:18:36,467
This is driving me nuts.

2061
01:18:37,167 --> 01:18:39,137
How did he know I was here?

2062
01:18:40,437 --> 01:18:41,977
(She's anxious.)

2063
01:18:43,277 --> 01:18:46,877
(Please pick up, class leader.)

2064
01:18:48,017 --> 01:18:50,147
Hold on. Ji Hyo...

2065
01:18:51,317 --> 01:18:54,687
Ji Hyo ripped Seok Jin's name tag?

2066
01:18:54,687 --> 01:18:56,557
He was a ghost?

2067
01:18:58,527 --> 01:19:00,087
I just got goosebumps. Look.

2068
01:19:00,487 --> 01:19:02,627
Look.

2069
01:19:02,927 --> 01:19:05,667
This doesn't make sense, right?

2070
01:19:06,827 --> 01:19:08,067
This doesn't make sense.

2071
01:19:08,737 --> 01:19:09,967
Class leader?

2072
01:19:09,967 --> 01:19:12,037
(It's me.)

2073
01:19:18,047 --> 01:19:20,507
I'm the class leader's mom.

2074
01:19:20,877 --> 01:19:26,147
My son went on a trip three years ago and...

2075
01:19:26,147 --> 01:19:29,417
(My son went on a trip three years ago and...)

2076
01:19:30,087 --> 01:19:32,857
I just got goosebumps.

2077
01:19:35,497 --> 01:19:38,197
(It was an unexpected call.)

2078
01:19:38,197 --> 01:19:44,337
(He asked if the 6 of them arrived safely.)

2079
01:19:46,137 --> 01:19:50,307
(The class leader died 3 years ago from a tragic accident.)

2080
01:19:53,147 --> 01:19:55,777
(Haha also found another hint.)

2081
01:19:59,335 --> 01:20:02,805
(What?)

2082
01:20:04,487 --> 01:20:05,787
(The ghost didn't enter the Labyrinth.)

2083
01:20:05,787 --> 01:20:09,727
(One of the ghosts didn't enter the Labyrinth.)

2084
01:20:09,927 --> 01:20:12,727
(That doesn't make any sense.)

2085
01:20:14,397 --> 01:20:17,437
(Jae Seok, Kwang Soo, and Seok Jin all went into the Labyrinth.)

2086
01:20:17,437 --> 01:20:20,877
(There were supposedly 2 ghosts in the elevator.)

2087
01:20:22,477 --> 01:20:26,677
(But one of the ghosts haven't been into the Labyrinth?)

2088
01:20:28,177 --> 01:20:30,577
How do I explain this nonsense?

2089
01:20:31,617 --> 01:20:33,147
I'm so confused.

2090
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:36,687
I'm a ghost.

2091
01:20:38,387 --> 01:20:40,027
Listen. This doesn't make any sense.

2092
01:20:40,587 --> 01:20:43,057
I'm a ghost.

2093
01:20:44,197 --> 01:20:47,737
I'm a ghost. Why should I be scared?

2094
01:20:47,737 --> 01:20:49,367
(I'm a ghost. Why should I be scared?)

2095
01:20:49,837 --> 01:20:51,607
The class leader...

2096
01:20:52,467 --> 01:20:53,807
was a ghost.

2097
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:56,277
(The class leader who called was a ghost.)

2098
01:20:57,947 --> 01:21:03,917
(The elevator stopped on the 4th floor because there were 2 ghosts.)

2099
01:21:03,917 --> 01:21:08,157
(That's strange.)

2100
01:21:10,187 --> 01:21:12,887
There are not just two ghosts.

2101
01:21:14,027 --> 01:21:17,797
- You're a human. - I'm a ghost.

2102
01:21:21,067 --> 01:21:22,597
Is the class leader dead?

2103
01:21:24,837 --> 01:21:26,507
When we were doing missions in the beginning,

2104
01:21:26,637 --> 01:21:30,207
there was a secret couple, so that means there are two people.

2105
01:21:30,507 --> 01:21:32,677
That's why I thought there were two ghosts.

2106
01:21:32,677 --> 01:21:34,277
It was a retreat with the ghosts...

2107
01:21:34,417 --> 01:21:37,747
There are two humans then.

2108
01:21:40,417 --> 01:21:46,727
(They said there were two people who had different identities.)

2109
01:21:47,057 --> 01:21:50,967
The class leader said, "Did the six of you arrive safely?"

2110
01:21:51,527 --> 01:21:53,267
"Did the six of you arrive safely?"

2111
01:21:54,497 --> 01:21:58,137
He can only see the six of us.

2112
01:21:58,407 --> 01:22:01,377
So that means there are...

2113
01:22:01,737 --> 01:22:02,907
six ghosts.

2114
01:22:02,907 --> 01:22:03,907
(There are 6 ghosts.)

2115
01:22:05,777 --> 01:22:11,547
(Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Jong Kook, Se Chan, and So Min are ghosts.)

2116
01:22:11,547 --> 01:22:18,287
(Either Haha or Kwang Soo is a human.)

2117
01:22:20,487 --> 01:22:23,427
Hold on. Let's bring this back to square one.

2118
01:22:23,597 --> 01:22:26,197
Let's think about this again. Wait.

2119
01:22:27,097 --> 01:22:28,697
Let me look for some more hints.

2120
01:22:28,737 --> 01:22:30,167
But it's you, Kwang Soo.

2121
01:22:32,067 --> 01:22:35,507
I'm not. I've been clarifying myself since the beginning.

2122
01:22:36,207 --> 01:22:38,747
Haha, you're a ghost.

2123
01:22:39,177 --> 01:22:40,307
- Me? - Yes.

2124
01:22:40,677 --> 01:22:42,077
Do you know why I'm not a ghost?

2125
01:22:42,277 --> 01:22:43,277
Why not?

2126
01:22:43,477 --> 01:22:44,817
Think carefully.

2127
01:22:44,817 --> 01:22:45,917
You're a ghost.

2128
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:47,987
I did my best today.

2129
01:22:49,687 --> 01:22:52,687
(Who's the ghost from these two?)

2130
01:22:52,687 --> 01:22:55,097
Hey, Haha. Go. Let's split.

2131
01:22:55,097 --> 01:22:56,457
- Let's split first. - This is strange.

2132
01:22:56,457 --> 01:22:58,327
Let's split first.

2133
01:22:58,427 --> 01:22:59,797
Let's go.

2134
01:23:01,097 --> 01:23:02,697
Maybe it's So Min.

2135
01:23:03,267 --> 01:23:04,767
So Min is alive.

2136
01:23:06,207 --> 01:23:07,207
So Min...

2137
01:23:08,037 --> 01:23:09,137
I think...

2138
01:23:10,207 --> 01:23:11,307
Kwang Soo still...

2139
01:23:12,207 --> 01:23:15,347
doesn't understand the game. He's stupid.

2140
01:23:15,847 --> 01:23:17,277
Hey, come here.

2141
01:23:17,277 --> 01:23:18,387
He's stupid.

2142
01:23:18,817 --> 01:23:20,647
Hey, come here.

2143
01:23:20,987 --> 01:23:22,017
- Come here. - Sorry.

2144
01:23:22,017 --> 01:23:24,557
- Come here. Hey. - No.

2145
01:23:24,587 --> 01:23:26,327
- I was joking. - Come here.

2146
01:23:26,487 --> 01:23:28,997
- You startled me. - Hey, come here.

2147
01:23:29,057 --> 01:23:30,997
I don't care if you're a ghost or a human.

2148
01:23:30,997 --> 01:23:32,227
- Oh, gosh. - Come here.

2149
01:23:32,227 --> 01:23:33,597
- Were you listening? - Fine. Just come.

2150
01:23:33,597 --> 01:23:34,667
Were you eavesdropping?

2151
01:23:34,667 --> 01:23:36,667
Hey, I don't care who you are. Come here.

2152
01:23:36,667 --> 01:23:37,737
Let's just...

2153
01:23:38,067 --> 01:23:40,067
Hey, let's just put an end to this.

2154
01:23:40,067 --> 01:23:42,877
(You'll die, and I'll live.)

2155
01:23:43,907 --> 01:23:45,847
(He runs away.)

2156
01:23:45,847 --> 01:23:47,077
(Locking)

2157
01:23:47,377 --> 01:23:48,977
- Go away. - Come here.

2158
01:23:49,877 --> 01:23:52,347
- It's you. - I tried to understand...

2159
01:23:52,647 --> 01:23:55,317
when you said things in front of me,

2160
01:23:55,387 --> 01:23:56,617
but how dare you talk behind my back?

2161
01:23:56,687 --> 01:23:57,987
- Open this. - Kwang Soo.

2162
01:23:58,087 --> 01:23:59,457
- Open it. - Kwang Soo.

2163
01:23:59,457 --> 01:24:01,257
- I want to speak to you. Open this. - Kwang Soo.

2164
01:24:01,457 --> 01:24:03,097
This is my last warning.

2165
01:24:03,127 --> 01:24:04,597
(Bowing)

2166
01:24:04,597 --> 01:24:05,667
Don't get caught again.

2167
01:24:05,667 --> 01:24:06,667
Salute.

2168
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:07,767
(He salutes the stupid man.)

2169
01:24:09,867 --> 01:24:10,907
I'm sorry.

2170
01:24:12,067 --> 01:24:13,067
Watch out.

2171
01:24:14,277 --> 01:24:15,577
Goodness.

2172
01:24:15,577 --> 01:24:16,577
(Jae Seok got a hint about the class leader.)

2173
01:24:16,577 --> 01:24:18,047
This is driving me nuts.

2174
01:24:18,577 --> 01:24:20,677
I'm sure Ji Hyo is human.

2175
01:24:22,377 --> 01:24:24,647
- Jae Seok. - My gosh.

2176
01:24:26,787 --> 01:24:28,357
- So Min. - Yes?

2177
01:24:28,557 --> 01:24:29,657
You're a ghost.

2178
01:24:29,787 --> 01:24:30,957
(One of the ghosts is a male.)

2179
01:24:30,957 --> 01:24:32,257
You are too.

2180
01:24:32,927 --> 01:24:34,327
I'm not a ghost.

2181
01:24:34,327 --> 01:24:35,557
You are.

2182
01:24:36,297 --> 01:24:37,297
I'm not.

2183
01:24:38,097 --> 01:24:39,467
(Jong Kook walks over.)

2184
01:24:39,867 --> 01:24:42,967
Say it. It's about time.

2185
01:24:43,467 --> 01:24:46,567
- Be quiet. - Ghost, say it.

2186
01:24:46,807 --> 01:24:47,977
We're all ghosts.

2187
01:24:47,977 --> 01:24:49,177
- Right. - Right?

2188
01:24:49,177 --> 01:24:50,177
Say it.

2189
01:24:50,907 --> 01:24:51,907
You're a ghost.

2190
01:24:52,577 --> 01:24:53,907
- I'm not sure. - She is.

2191
01:24:53,907 --> 01:24:54,917
She's a ghost,

2192
01:24:54,917 --> 01:24:55,917
- and you are too. - I am.

2193
01:24:55,917 --> 01:24:57,047
Are you a ghost too?

2194
01:24:57,047 --> 01:24:58,917
See? It's weird.

2195
01:24:58,917 --> 01:25:00,587
Let me explain.

2196
01:25:01,187 --> 01:25:02,987
You, you, or I...

2197
01:25:03,887 --> 01:25:05,887
have to lure humans and get out in order to win.

2198
01:25:05,887 --> 01:25:07,557
- Right. - You understand, right?

2199
01:25:07,897 --> 01:25:09,097
I think...

2200
01:25:09,297 --> 01:25:11,197
the last ghost is Kwang Soo.

2201
01:25:11,227 --> 01:25:14,167
- Haha or Se Chan is human. - Haha.

2202
01:25:14,567 --> 01:25:15,867
Se Chan is a ghost.

2203
01:25:16,667 --> 01:25:18,307
- Really? - I think he's human.

2204
01:25:18,307 --> 01:25:19,567
- No, because... - Let's...

2205
01:25:19,567 --> 01:25:22,037
Let's split, and as I said,

2206
01:25:22,977 --> 01:25:24,747
- I'm a ghost... - Let's get on the elevator.

2207
01:25:24,747 --> 01:25:25,907
- Okay. - Yes?

2208
01:25:26,647 --> 01:25:27,677
You can go.

2209
01:25:27,917 --> 01:25:29,077
(The ghosts separate to find more hints.)

2210
01:25:29,077 --> 01:25:30,117
Get going.

2211
01:25:30,987 --> 01:25:35,317
My gosh. There isn't much.

2212
01:25:37,217 --> 01:25:38,927
Why can't I find any hints?

2213
01:25:39,927 --> 01:25:41,057
This is driving me nuts.

2214
01:25:44,767 --> 01:25:46,127
(Why?)

2215
01:25:46,867 --> 01:25:48,997
(He bumps into somebody.)

2216
01:25:52,007 --> 01:25:55,637
Jong Kook is out.

2217
01:25:56,637 --> 01:26:00,307
Jong Kook is out.

2218
01:26:00,577 --> 01:26:03,417
Ghost Jong Kook is out.

2219
01:26:04,187 --> 01:26:06,917
(If Jong Kook is out,)

2220
01:26:08,187 --> 01:26:12,957
(it was a human besides Ji Hyo who ripped his name tag.)

2221
01:26:16,657 --> 01:26:17,667
My gosh.

2222
01:26:17,667 --> 01:26:18,797
(It gives her goosebumps.)

2223
01:26:20,667 --> 01:26:21,667
Who ripped his name tag?

2224
01:26:21,667 --> 01:26:22,997
(Who was it?)

2225
01:26:23,967 --> 01:26:27,837
(Was it Haha?)

2226
01:26:27,837 --> 01:26:28,837
All right.

2227
01:26:29,107 --> 01:26:30,577
I'm soaked in sweat.

2228
01:26:30,577 --> 01:26:32,277
(Or was it Kwang Soo?)

2229
01:26:32,277 --> 01:26:33,847
I'm sweating so much.

2230
01:26:36,747 --> 01:26:39,187
(It's 10 minutes before the end of the race.)

2231
01:26:39,187 --> 01:26:44,387
10 minutes before the end of the race.

2232
01:26:45,027 --> 01:26:47,027
I need to find more hints about the humans.

2233
01:26:47,187 --> 01:26:48,857
That's the only way for me to survive.

2234
01:26:48,897 --> 01:26:50,057
I can't trust anybody.

2235
01:26:50,397 --> 01:26:51,497
(If she exits with another human, they win.)

2236
01:26:51,497 --> 01:26:52,497
They are all ghosts.

2237
01:26:52,497 --> 01:26:54,137
(If she exits with another human, they win.)

2238
01:26:54,137 --> 01:26:56,737
- They are all ghosts. - This is no joke.

2239
01:26:56,737 --> 01:26:58,767
(If a human exits with a ghost, the ghosts win the race.)

2240
01:26:58,767 --> 01:27:01,577
I have to find more hints.

2241
01:27:01,577 --> 01:27:03,207
(Is Haha human?)

2242
01:27:03,207 --> 01:27:06,807
Who's the human? I'm so scared.

2243
01:27:06,807 --> 01:27:11,447
(Or is it Kwang Soo?)

2244
01:27:14,287 --> 01:27:17,017
- Kwang Soo. - What is it?

2245
01:27:17,087 --> 01:27:18,557
Did you find a hint or not?

2246
01:27:18,557 --> 01:27:20,157
- I only found one. - What are you?

2247
01:27:20,157 --> 01:27:21,157
That's why I ripped Jong Kook's name tag.

2248
01:27:21,157 --> 01:27:23,097
(He saw the hint, and got Jong Kook out.)

2249
01:27:23,097 --> 01:27:29,867
(Hold on. Kwang Soo eliminated Jong Kook?)

2250
01:27:29,867 --> 01:27:32,467
(Is Kwang Soo human then?)

2251
01:27:32,467 --> 01:27:33,637
- You ripped his? - Yes.

2252
01:27:33,637 --> 01:27:35,737
(Is Kwang Soo human then?)

2253
01:27:35,737 --> 01:27:37,747
- Are you sure? - I ripped it.

2254
01:27:37,747 --> 01:27:40,577
(Kwang Soo has to be human if he got Jong Kook out.)

2255
01:27:40,577 --> 01:27:42,317
When is the ghost elevator opening?

2256
01:27:42,477 --> 01:27:44,217
We just need to get on it with another person.

2257
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:46,587
I have two people I'm suspicious about.

2258
01:27:46,587 --> 01:27:48,017
The three of us can get on the elevator.

2259
01:27:48,017 --> 01:27:49,017
Right.

2260
01:27:49,687 --> 01:27:50,687
Kwang Soo.

2261
01:27:52,187 --> 01:27:53,887
- Are you a ghost? - No, I'm not.

2262
01:27:53,987 --> 01:27:55,127
I ripped Jong Kook's name tag.

2263
01:27:55,297 --> 01:27:56,757
- Really? - Yes.

2264
01:27:57,497 --> 01:27:58,767
You should come with me then.

2265
01:27:59,197 --> 01:28:00,197
I'm sure.

2266
01:28:00,197 --> 01:28:01,897
Kwang Soo, you lose if you go with Haha.

2267
01:28:01,897 --> 01:28:03,997
- Come with me. I'm a human. - Because Ji Hyo and I...

2268
01:28:04,067 --> 01:28:06,867
I didn't find a hint yet.

2269
01:28:06,937 --> 01:28:09,907
She ripped Seok Jin's name tag, so she's 100-percent human.

2270
01:28:09,907 --> 01:28:11,207
What was the situation? Tell me.

2271
01:28:11,207 --> 01:28:12,577
We were just talking, and I ripped it.

2272
01:28:12,577 --> 01:28:14,217
I saw the person ripping his name tag.

2273
01:28:14,217 --> 01:28:17,377
(I'm sorry.)

2274
01:28:17,377 --> 01:28:22,387
(Is Haha really the witness?)

2275
01:28:22,387 --> 01:28:26,757
(Is Kwang Soo lying about ripping Jong Kook's name tag?)

2276
01:28:26,757 --> 01:28:28,027
- Did you really rip his name tag? - Yes.

2277
01:28:28,027 --> 01:28:30,327
The ghost elevator has opened.

2278
01:28:30,327 --> 01:28:31,467
(It's an announcement...)

2279
01:28:31,467 --> 01:28:34,337
(about the opening of the ghost elevator.)

2280
01:28:34,337 --> 01:28:36,067
- Let's go. - Sure.

2281
01:28:36,067 --> 01:28:37,167
- Let's go. - Go.

2282
01:28:37,267 --> 01:28:38,267
Let's go together.

2283
01:28:38,637 --> 01:28:39,767
Where are you, Kwang Soo?

2284
01:28:40,007 --> 01:28:41,207
It's okay. We can get there first.

2285
01:28:41,207 --> 01:28:42,437
Let's go.

2286
01:28:42,437 --> 01:28:44,307
(The 3 who arrive first get to go on the elevator.)

2287
01:28:44,877 --> 01:28:46,177
- Let's get on it. - Let's go.

2288
01:28:47,077 --> 01:28:52,087
(It's the last chance to check each other's identities.)

2289
01:28:55,017 --> 01:28:56,487
(Ji Hyo, Haha, and Kwang Soo get on it.)

2290
01:28:56,487 --> 01:28:58,127
This is scary.

2291
01:28:58,657 --> 01:28:59,827
Let's see where it stops.

2292
01:29:00,727 --> 01:29:02,657
Did they get on it? Let's go to the fourth floor.

2293
01:29:02,657 --> 01:29:04,057
(The elevator stops on the 4th floor if there are 2 ghosts on it.)

2294
01:29:04,057 --> 01:29:07,767
(What floor will the elevator stop on?)

2295
01:29:09,797 --> 01:29:12,667
(It didn't stop...)

2296
01:29:12,667 --> 01:29:13,667
(on the 4th floor.)

2297
01:29:13,667 --> 01:29:15,407
We were right.

2298
01:29:15,407 --> 01:29:16,877
We passed.

2299
01:29:17,647 --> 01:29:19,647
We were right.

2300
01:29:19,647 --> 01:29:22,317
See? Did you see that?

2301
01:29:22,317 --> 01:29:23,647
(2 out of 3 of them are humans.)

2302
01:29:23,647 --> 01:29:27,017
There's one ghost in here. That's the most likely possibility.

2303
01:29:27,017 --> 01:29:28,487
That's right. There's either one ghost or none.

2304
01:29:28,487 --> 01:29:30,087
- There's 1 or none. - There are 2.

2305
01:29:31,187 --> 01:29:32,927
There are two, Kwang Soo.

2306
01:29:33,127 --> 01:29:35,197
Let me share my hint with you.

2307
01:29:35,797 --> 01:29:36,797
There are...

2308
01:29:39,697 --> 01:29:41,137
six ghosts. Did you know that?

2309
01:29:42,137 --> 01:29:43,137
Because...

2310
01:29:43,567 --> 01:29:46,037
the class leader is a ghost.

2311
01:29:47,437 --> 01:29:48,437
(Kwang Soo and Haha didn't know that.)

2312
01:29:48,437 --> 01:29:50,507
- Did you get that hint? - Yes.

2313
01:29:51,477 --> 01:29:54,747
The emergency exit for two people has opened.

2314
01:29:55,277 --> 01:29:59,917
(The emergency exit is open?)

2315
01:30:01,917 --> 01:30:05,227
Ji Hyo, I ripped Jong Kook's name tag.

2316
01:30:05,227 --> 01:30:07,697
(Why is he changing his words?)

2317
01:30:07,757 --> 01:30:08,957
- You ripped Jong Kook's name tag? - Yes.

2318
01:30:08,957 --> 01:30:10,827
- You said you saw it. - I ripped it.

2319
01:30:10,827 --> 01:30:12,097
(Why is Haha saying that he ripped it?)

2320
01:30:12,097 --> 01:30:14,067
I ripped it.

2321
01:30:14,067 --> 01:30:15,797
I swear. I'm the Mapo Sheriff.

2322
01:30:15,797 --> 01:30:17,907
Look at my eyes. I really ripped it.

2323
01:30:17,907 --> 01:30:19,437
I don't think I need to respond to that.

2324
01:30:19,437 --> 01:30:20,437
I'm serious.

2325
01:30:20,437 --> 01:30:22,037
(Who are these two?)

2326
01:30:22,037 --> 01:30:23,437
(Who's the real human?)

2327
01:30:23,437 --> 01:30:24,447
Think about it.

2328
01:30:24,777 --> 01:30:26,577
If you don't listen to me...

2329
01:30:26,577 --> 01:30:27,747
Listen.

2330
01:30:28,377 --> 01:30:32,017
Kwang Soo, Haha, and Ji Hyo got on the elevator.

2331
01:30:32,017 --> 01:30:34,487
Ji Hyo is a human for sure.

2332
01:30:35,957 --> 01:30:38,557
We have to make Ji Hyo think that he's human...

2333
01:30:38,557 --> 01:30:40,797
so that she takes him with her.

2334
01:30:41,057 --> 01:30:42,297
That's how we'll win.

2335
01:30:43,397 --> 01:30:45,997
Ji Hyo, tell me if you ripped Seok Jin's name tag.

2336
01:30:45,997 --> 01:30:49,267
Haha. I got a great hint.

2337
01:30:49,637 --> 01:30:51,567
- I got goosebumps. - What is it?

2338
01:30:51,667 --> 01:30:52,967
- You have to trust me. - Really?

2339
01:30:52,967 --> 01:30:54,177
- Ji Hyo. - Hey.

2340
01:30:54,177 --> 01:30:55,977
- Don't you trust me? - They're all ghosts.

2341
01:30:55,977 --> 01:30:57,277
- There are six ghosts. - Look.

2342
01:30:57,277 --> 01:30:59,207
Aren't you going to trust me? I'm not going to say anything.

2343
01:30:59,207 --> 01:31:01,377
It's weird if she doesn't pick me.

2344
01:31:01,377 --> 01:31:02,577
- I swear. - So Min.

2345
01:31:02,577 --> 01:31:04,217
I ripped it on the second floor.

2346
01:31:04,317 --> 01:31:06,587
- Ji Hyo, you saw how I reacted. - Fine. Turn around.

2347
01:31:06,587 --> 01:31:07,857
- I'm the Mapo Sheriff. - Fine.

2348
01:31:07,857 --> 01:31:09,687
You don't get to decide. I can too.

2349
01:31:09,687 --> 01:31:12,187
If you ripped Seok Jin's name tag, come with me.

2350
01:31:12,187 --> 01:31:14,197
(Is it a ghost's lie or a human telling the truth?)

2351
01:31:14,197 --> 01:31:17,967
(There's 1 minute left until the exit closes.)

2352
01:31:17,997 --> 01:31:19,197
- Turn around. I get it. - I'm the Mapo Sheriff.

2353
01:31:19,197 --> 01:31:22,097
(I can't get lured by a ghost's lie.)

2354
01:31:22,337 --> 01:31:23,467
Who ripped Jong Kook's name tag?

2355
01:31:23,467 --> 01:31:26,067
Jae Seok saw me.

2356
01:31:28,277 --> 01:31:31,947
Haha ripped Jong Kook's name tag.

2357
01:31:32,047 --> 01:31:33,407
Yes, it was him.

2358
01:31:33,677 --> 01:31:36,577
(Ghost Jae Seok says it was Haha.)

2359
01:31:37,787 --> 01:31:39,047
(It's me, Ji Hyo. Don't you get it?)

2360
01:31:39,047 --> 01:31:40,047
I ripped it.

2361
01:31:40,487 --> 01:31:41,917
Haha ripped his name tag.

2362
01:31:43,487 --> 01:31:46,687
(He says Haha is human.)

2363
01:31:46,687 --> 01:31:47,697
Go away.

2364
01:31:47,697 --> 01:31:48,697
(He's on the same side as Jae Seok.)

2365
01:31:48,697 --> 01:31:50,597
Let's go.

2366
01:31:50,597 --> 01:31:53,797
Haha, one of the hints said that a ghost...

2367
01:31:53,797 --> 01:31:55,037
was a singer.

2368
01:31:55,037 --> 01:31:56,597
(Thanks to Jae Seok, Ji Hyo chooses Kwang Soo.)

2369
01:31:56,597 --> 01:31:58,567
- That's Jong Kook. - She's right.

2370
01:31:58,667 --> 01:32:00,067
- That's Jong Kook, you stupid. - Let's go.

2371
01:32:00,067 --> 01:32:01,137
That was close.

2372
01:32:01,137 --> 01:32:02,977
(Open the gate of the truth.)

2373
01:32:04,077 --> 01:32:06,947
(Did we win the race?)

2374
01:32:06,947 --> 01:32:08,177
We made it.

2375
01:32:08,177 --> 01:32:13,547
(Was Ji Hyo's choice right?)

2376
01:32:14,417 --> 01:32:15,687
Are you really human?

2377
01:32:15,757 --> 01:32:16,887
- He's human! - No?

2378
01:32:16,887 --> 01:32:18,157
- Are you? - Team Ghost wins.

2379
01:32:18,157 --> 01:32:22,927
(Team Ghost wins.)

2380
01:32:24,167 --> 01:32:25,267
(Kwang Soo, were you a ghost?)

2381
01:32:25,267 --> 01:32:26,727
- I told you. - He's a ghost.

2382
01:32:26,927 --> 01:32:28,497
We won the race.

2383
01:32:28,537 --> 01:32:29,997
Jong Kook and I...

2384
01:32:29,997 --> 01:32:31,907
(Haha and Ji Hyo were the only humans.)

2385
01:32:31,907 --> 01:32:33,207
Team Ghost!

2386
01:32:33,207 --> 01:32:36,607
(They celebrate their win by jumping up and down.)

2387
01:32:36,607 --> 01:32:42,917
(Actually, Janny played the crucial role in helping Team Ghost win.)

2388
01:32:42,917 --> 01:32:47,047
(She was the first to find out that there were more than 2 ghosts.)

2389
01:32:47,047 --> 01:32:50,957
(Ghosts need to cooperate in order to possess humans.)

2390
01:32:50,957 --> 01:32:52,187
You, you, or me.

2391
01:32:52,187 --> 01:32:53,687
(He gathered the ghosts.)

2392
01:32:53,687 --> 01:32:55,727
We need to possess the humans and get out to win this race.

2393
01:32:57,027 --> 01:33:00,567
(Who else is a human other than Ji Hyo?)

2394
01:33:01,567 --> 01:33:05,607
(Haha became sure that Jong Kook was the ghost and eliminated him...)

2395
01:33:05,607 --> 01:33:09,937
(after getting a hint about a ghost who hadn't been to the Labyrinth.)

2396
01:33:09,937 --> 01:33:11,507
I think Haha eliminated him.

2397
01:33:11,507 --> 01:33:14,077
(Haha was the human who eliminated Jong Kook.)

2398
01:33:14,077 --> 01:33:18,447
(So Haha is the human.)

2399
01:33:19,287 --> 01:33:21,757
- Who eliminated Jong Kook? - Jae Seok saw me.

2400
01:33:21,757 --> 01:33:28,457
(Janny played the intense mind game, and led Team Ghost to win the race.)

2401
01:33:29,227 --> 01:33:32,867
Ji Hyo, we were almost there.

2402
01:33:32,867 --> 01:33:36,337
- Ji Hyo, good job. - From the beginning, you...

2403
01:33:37,067 --> 01:33:39,137
You didn't tell me when I asked you.

2404
01:33:39,137 --> 01:33:40,267
That confused me.

2405
01:33:40,337 --> 01:33:41,877
I thought I was the main lead today.

2406
01:33:41,877 --> 01:33:44,077
- So the humans are the main leads. - I know.

2407
01:33:44,147 --> 01:33:46,007
I thought so too.

2408
01:33:46,007 --> 01:33:48,277
- All day long, I... - I thought the same.

2409
01:33:48,677 --> 01:33:50,217
(The race ends.)

2410
01:33:50,217 --> 01:33:52,317
Team Ghost wins today's race.

2411
01:33:52,917 --> 01:33:54,857
Is it Team Ghost or me alone?

2412
01:33:54,857 --> 01:33:56,257
- It's Team Ghost. - Team Ghost.

2413
01:33:56,257 --> 01:33:57,287
Come on.

2414
01:33:57,287 --> 01:33:59,557
- I mean... - It's not you alone.

2415
01:33:59,727 --> 01:34:01,697
- I asked because I didn't know. - That ghost.

2416
01:34:01,697 --> 01:34:03,527
He looked familiar,

2417
01:34:03,527 --> 01:34:05,727
and now, I realized that he's like the subway ghost from "Ghost".

2418
01:34:05,727 --> 01:34:07,537
- That's right. - What?

2419
01:34:07,537 --> 01:34:09,637
- Why am I like the subway ghost? - He's right.

2420
01:34:10,267 --> 01:34:13,607
Team Human is the losing team of today's race.

2421
01:34:13,607 --> 01:34:17,777
Haha and Ji Hyo will receive the penalty.

2422
01:34:18,007 --> 01:34:21,017
The penalty, seriously. It's driving me crazy.

2423
01:34:21,117 --> 01:34:22,277
The final penalty is called...

2424
01:34:22,677 --> 01:34:25,117
Give Me My Name Tag.

2425
01:34:25,117 --> 01:34:27,017
Haha and Ji Hyo's name tags are...

2426
01:34:27,017 --> 01:34:28,717
hidden in the basement.

2427
01:34:28,717 --> 01:34:30,087
- Goodness. - It must be scary.

2428
01:34:30,157 --> 01:34:32,757
They'll go in without any cameramen.

2429
01:34:32,757 --> 01:34:35,957
They'll be able to go home only after they find their name tags.

2430
01:34:36,227 --> 01:34:37,357
It sounds scary.

2431
01:34:37,527 --> 01:34:39,767
Is it because Haha and I didn't go to the Labyrinth?

2432
01:34:39,767 --> 01:34:42,967
(Why are you doing this to us?)

2433
01:34:44,167 --> 01:34:49,237
(The night deepens.)

2434
01:34:49,437 --> 01:34:53,707
(The lights get turned off one by one.)

2435
01:34:55,217 --> 01:34:59,517
(Welcome, you haven't seen the red lights for a while, have you?)

2436
01:34:59,517 --> 01:35:03,917
(It's a haunted house full of ghosts.)

2437
01:35:04,627 --> 01:35:06,827
Oh, my. Where is my name tag?

2438
01:35:08,327 --> 01:35:09,357
(Crying)

2439
01:35:09,357 --> 01:35:10,867
Don't cry.

2440
01:35:11,627 --> 01:35:14,237
Ji Hyo, what should we do? Goodness.

2441
01:35:14,237 --> 01:35:15,897
- Gosh. - You scared me.

2442
01:35:16,867 --> 01:35:18,667
Please find my name tag for me.

2443
01:35:19,567 --> 01:35:20,667
Don't cry.

2444
01:35:20,667 --> 01:35:22,537
(He's on alert.)

2445
01:35:22,537 --> 01:35:23,737
Gosh!

2446
01:35:23,737 --> 01:35:25,447
(Gosh)

2447
01:35:25,447 --> 01:35:28,517
(Haha's known to get easily frightened.)

2448
01:35:28,517 --> 01:35:30,377
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

2449
01:35:30,377 --> 01:35:32,747
(Will he succeed in finding his name tag?)

2450
01:35:35,457 --> 01:35:38,787
(He's really scared.)

2451
01:35:39,827 --> 01:35:42,857
(What are these fireworks?)

2452
01:35:42,857 --> 01:35:45,397
(Ji Hyo steps on them furiously.)

2453
01:35:46,727 --> 01:35:49,537
(Ji Hyo takes the lead for the scared Haha.)

2454
01:35:49,537 --> 01:35:51,137
I think our name tags are in here.

2455
01:35:51,137 --> 01:35:54,777
(They enter the designing room in which some creepy music is on.)

2456
01:35:54,777 --> 01:35:56,137
Stop singing.

2457
01:35:57,277 --> 01:35:59,777
Haha, stay behind me.

2458
01:35:59,807 --> 01:36:01,717
- Okay. - Stay behind me.

2459
01:36:03,447 --> 01:36:05,087
- Haha, come this way. - Hold on.

2460
01:36:05,387 --> 01:36:07,087
- Haha. - I found your name tag.

2461
01:36:07,117 --> 01:36:08,657
- Where? - Over there.

2462
01:36:09,317 --> 01:36:10,317
There.

2463
01:36:10,317 --> 01:36:11,527
(He finds Ji Hyo's name tag in the cabinet.)

2464
01:36:11,527 --> 01:36:12,787
Ji Hyo, you won't leave me behind, will you?

2465
01:36:13,127 --> 01:36:15,157
Gosh, no way.

2466
01:36:16,727 --> 01:36:18,497
- Here. - What?

2467
01:36:18,497 --> 01:36:20,897
(Handing him the flashlight)

2468
01:36:22,167 --> 01:36:23,797
(Don't tell me that you'll leave me here.)

2469
01:36:23,797 --> 01:36:25,737
- Here. - Ji Hyo.

2470
01:36:25,737 --> 01:36:27,677
Haha, I found mine.

2471
01:36:28,077 --> 01:36:29,407
I shouldn't have told you that.

2472
01:36:29,407 --> 01:36:31,507
(This must not be real.)

2473
01:36:31,507 --> 01:36:33,077
Ji Hyo, you're joking, right?

2474
01:36:33,077 --> 01:36:36,447
(Ji Hyo found her name tag, and escaped alone.)

2475
01:36:37,377 --> 01:36:40,017
Why did they make it so hard to find mine?

2476
01:36:40,017 --> 01:36:41,157
(He complains to the staff.)

2477
01:36:41,157 --> 01:36:43,487
(Screaming)

2478
01:36:43,957 --> 01:36:48,557
(He ended up not being able to escape from the haunted house.)

2479
01:36:48,557 --> 01:36:49,827
This never ends.

2480
01:36:50,097 --> 01:36:52,127
Aren't they the same with different names?

2481
01:36:53,227 --> 01:36:54,267
(It's still not over.)

2482
01:36:54,267 --> 01:36:56,897
(The 3rd part of their global project)

2483
01:36:57,667 --> 01:37:02,507
(The Running Man members have recommended 8 places to travel.)

2484
01:37:03,007 --> 01:37:06,247
(But they can't go just because they want to.)

2485
01:37:06,807 --> 01:37:09,017
(Only for Running Man,)

2486
01:37:09,017 --> 01:37:11,387
(the staff members have selected 8 places to travel as well.)

2487
01:37:12,517 --> 01:37:16,717
(It's the Running Man members versus the staff.)

2488
01:37:16,717 --> 01:37:19,527
(They must win against the staff.)

2489
01:37:19,527 --> 01:37:21,097
This is really stressful.

2490
01:37:21,097 --> 01:37:22,797
Are you a psycho?

2491
01:37:22,797 --> 01:37:24,327
(Half and Half Tour)
