1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
(Parental guidance is advised for viewers under the age of 12.)

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,580
(Running Man roamed the world for Global Race Part 1 and Part 2.)

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,280
(They betrayed each other endlessly for I Go Stickers.)

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,750
(The first race took them to a dangerous tourist attraction.)

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,690
(Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear)

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,660
(The second race took them to a place for 1 percent.)

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,090
(So Min and Kwang Soo)

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,530
(Se Chan and Haha)

9
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,870
(They were chosen to go to a place for 1 percent.)

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:29,970
(Now)

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,270
(The upgraded Global Project Part 3: Half and Half Tour)

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,440
(The production crew and Running Man have a showdown.)

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,340
(It starts now.)

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,080
(Sinsa Park)

15
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,910
(Fall is just around the corner at a park in Seoul.)

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,220
(What does the day have in store for Running Man?)

17
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,420
(Why are there only two members?)

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,760
I can't believe Kwang Soo and I are in the same team.

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,660
Do you want to see us play dirty?

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,900
- Is this a competition? - Tell us what we are doing today.

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,230
I am confident when it comes to a competition.

22
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,800
I don't want to lose in a competition against him.

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,830
(While one pair has equally-matched rivals...)

24
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,300
- We were partners. - We make a strange pair.

25
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,810
(Another pair has unlikely partners.)

26
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,440
That's right. I think it will be great.

27
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,080
(What kind of a mission do the pairs have?)

28
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,850
Running Man's new project will begin today.

29
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,180
Before we get started with the race...

30
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,920
You will have to play a game for the mission money.

31
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,090
- It's called Friends, Go. - You will play Friends, Go.

32
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,460
Friends, Go.

33
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,560
- Friends, Go? - Friends, Go.

34
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,560
I will explain the rules.

35
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,700
Two members will make a team for this mission.

36
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,600
You will each spin a wheel with gender or the year of birth.

37
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,710
Then you will go to a celebrity who fit the combined condition...

38
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,310
and complete a hidden mission...

39
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,710
- separately. - We will each have a mission.

40
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:48,110
You will decide your mission with a draw.

41
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,550
The first one to complete the hidden mission gets 10 dollars.

42
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,150
(The first one to complete the hidden mission gets 10 dollars.)

43
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,960
- That means we aren't a team. - We aren't a team.

44
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,060
- Let's take this to the end. - He needs to be...

45
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,790
taught a lesson.

46
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,160
- I am confident today. - He needs to be taught a lesson.

47
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,200
- I will bet my everything. - He is a dirty liar...

48
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,600
who needs to be taught a lesson.

49
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,040
She is bound to betray me when money is involved.

50
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,000
- No, you and I are a team. - Hey,

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,040
forget it.

52
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,740
I would trust a stray dog over you.

53
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,280
I would trust the fish in Han River over you.

54
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,110
- Ji Hyo. - What will you do to me?

55
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,280
- Loyalty! - I am scared of her.

56
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,590
The first four members to arrive at the place for the opening...

57
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,390
after completing the mission...

58
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,730
get additional 10 dollars.

59
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,630
(The first 4 members...)

60
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,860
(get additional 10 dollars.)

61
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,960
She is bound to betray me.

62
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,170
- Ji Hyo. - I am afraid...

63
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,270
she will trip me like Kwang Soo.

64
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,210
The members will leave if their partners are taking too long.

65
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,270
- They will move on their own. - Wouldn't it be better...

66
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,340
- to move separately? - Seriously.

67
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,340
(What does the fate have in store for the competitors?)

68
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,480
Here are the wheels.

69
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,910
- My goodness. - We need to spin it right.

70
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,820
It will be a disaster if we choose the 50s.

71
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,350
There is the 50s.

72
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,450
Who was born in the 50s?

73
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,190
- They will be over 60 years old. - Heung Gook was born in the 50s.

74
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,860
Joo Byung Jin. Lee Hong Ryeol.

75
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,690
- I can give you a list. - There are quite a few of them.

76
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,730
There are a lot of them.

77
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,100
Weren't you born in the 50s?

78
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,630
What are you talking about?

79
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,900
I will spin the wheel.

80
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,900
(Ji Hyo spins the wheel with the year of birth.)

81
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,070
Please.

82
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,040
(She needs to pick her peers to have an easy mission.)

83
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,780
The 70s.

84
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,850
(A celebrity who was born in the 70s)

85
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,980
(So Min spins a wheel to determine the sex.)

86
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,520
- Male. - Male.

87
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,250
Meet a male celebrity who was born in the 50s.

88
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,020
My goodness.

89
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,090
(Seok Jin and Jong Kook get...)

90
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,090
It's nice.

91
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,260
- Female. - Female.

92
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,930
(A female celebrity who was born in the 90s)

93
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,460
A female celebrity who was born in the 90s.

94
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,870
Female in the 90s.

95
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,070
Let me get the 90s.

96
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,200
(Haha and Se Chan get...)

97
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,770
(a female celebrity who was born in the 80s.)

98
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,370
The 80s is a wide pool.

99
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,440
So many celebrities were born in the 80s.

100
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,110
- Firstly, - Male or female.

101
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,110
let's spin this wheel.

102
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,480
It will be better...

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,580
(They want to meet a female celebrity.)

104
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,750
- We may not get what we want. - It doesn't really matter.

105
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,250
That's right.

106
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,190
- Let's go. - I will spin the wheel.

107
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,860
(Please let it be a female.)

108
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,190
(Dreams do come true.)

109
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,260
Yes. We got a female celebrity.

110
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,130
If we get a female celebrity who was born in the 50s,

111
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,070
I don't know anyone.

112
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,170
- We can do this the easy way. - That's right.

113
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,270
- All right. - Jae Seok.

114
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,370
(Please let us get the 80s or the 90s.)

115
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,110
- The 90s would be a good choice. - That's right.

116
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,080
(The 70s)

117
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,720
Someone who was born in the 70s?

118
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,850
(A female celebrity who was born in the 70s)

119
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,650
(It's much different from their expectation.)

120
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,590
- Shall we... - Goodness.

121
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,820
A female star who was born in 70s...

122
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,920
(They're searching online.)

123
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,890
(Who was born in the 70s?)

124
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,300
Lizzy lives around here.

125
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,000
I can't find anyone.

126
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,730
What are you going to do?

127
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,300
You ruined it.

128
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,000
- It's ruined because of you. - Because of me?

129
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,300
- Me? - Yes.

130
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,170
- The 70s is not a problem. - It's not a problem?

131
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,110
- It's hard because it's a woman? - Yes.

132
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,140
(It's hard to find a woman born in the 70s.)

133
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,610
(Will Jae Seok and Kwang Soo be able to find the right celebrity?)

134
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,520
All right, Kwang Soo. Turn your head around first.

135
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,920
- Jae Seok will pick one first. - Okay.

136
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,090
(They must clear their hidden mission before the other does.)

137
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,190
Pick one, check what's written inside, and put it back in.

138
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,290
(They must clear their hidden mission before the other does.)

139
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:27,000
(What is Jae Seok's hidden mission?)

140
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,370
(Make her grab you by the collar.)

141
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,540
(How should he make her want to grab his collar?)

142
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,580
(What is the unlucky Kwang Soo's hidden mission?)

143
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,710
Gosh, hold on.

144
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,320
(Make her splash water on you.)

145
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,250
(Why did he have to pick such a mission?)

146
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,650
(Ji Hyo and So Min pick their hidden missions as well.)

147
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,220
(Make the guest splash water on you.)

148
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,060
(Ji Hyo and So Min pick their hidden missions as well.)

149
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,560
Gosh, it's bad. What should I do?

150
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,990
(Se Chan and Haha pick their missions too.)

151
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,290
Gosh, what should I do?

152
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,730
Gosh, is yours hard?

153
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,330
My goodness.

154
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,430
(They finish picking their hidden missions.)

155
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,640
Why...

156
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,500
Gosh, it's so frustrating.

157
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,440
(He's reminded of Sook while looking through phone numbers.)

158
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,140
- Let's try calling her. - Should we?

159
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,850
(He calls his close friend, Kim Sook, who was born in 1975.)

160
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,580
Sook seems to be very busy these days.

161
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,820
(He calls his close friend, Kim Sook, who was born in 1975.)

162
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,720
(Will she accept their sudden request and join them?)

163
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,760
Hi, Jae Seok.

164
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,960
Sook, where are you?

165
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,860
- I'm home. - What's your plan for today?

166
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,160
- Me? - Yes.

167
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,530
I'm going to sleep.

168
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,470
It's 12pm now. Until when will you sleep?

169
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,870
Sook.

170
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,740
What's the use in waking up? I have nothing to do.

171
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,270
You have a point there.

172
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,280
Did you play computer games and sleep late last night?

173
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,680
- No. - Then?

174
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,180
I worked a bit.

175
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,480
- Did you work until late yesterday? - Yes.

176
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,950
Until what time?

177
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,720
7pm.

178
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,690
(She worked until 7pm.)

179
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,520
That's not late at night.

180
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,090
That's not even late. 7pm...

181
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,830
- You finished early yesterday. - That's before dinnertime.

182
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,100
I worked too much yesterday.

183
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,300
I was supposed to leave work at 6pm sharp.

184
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,370
- So you worked an hour overtime. - Yes.

185
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,040
Hello, Sook. I'm Kwang Soo.

186
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,040
- Hey, it's been a while. - Yes, hello.

187
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,440
Oh, it's Running Man.

188
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,380
- Yes. - How did you find out?

189
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,550
You two are together, so it's Running Man.

190
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,350
I see. You're very smart.

191
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,380
- It has nothing to do about it. - Stay still.

192
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,550
- Stay still. - But...

193
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,250
She likes to be complimented.

194
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,690
Hello?

195
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,790
(You need to give many compliments in order to cast someone.)

196
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,030
You must be a genius.

197
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,530
- Sook. - Yes?

198
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,760
- Don't you live in Mapo? - Yes.

199
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,030
We need to do a simple mission.

200
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,770
Gosh, I'm too lazy.

201
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,440
We can ask anyone to do this mission together,

202
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,610
but we decided to ask you after 30 minutes of discussion.

203
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,770
It's you.

204
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,080
- It has to be someone we know. - It's you.

205
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,080
- Right. - That's how we decided to ask you.

206
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,480
Gosh, I'm too lazy.

207
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,350
- Well, Sook. - Yes?

208
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,980
We'll visit you soon.

209
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,480
Don't you dare.

210
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,650
We won't go to your house.

211
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,350
You need to hold a housewarming party.

212
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,060
Wash your face, and come out.

213
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,290
There's my favorite coffee shop nearby.

214
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,330
Okay, we'll go there.

215
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,700
(They'll go with their missions to see her.)

216
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,830
Seeing how it's starting to rain,

217
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,870
I think we'll have to ask either Na Rae or Gook Ju.

218
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,370
This gloomy weather will go perfectly with Na Rae.

219
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,570
- I'll try calling her first. - Try calling Na Rae.

220
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,140
All right.

221
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,110
- Hello? - Hello?

222
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,010
- Hey. - Where are you?

223
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,780
- I'm home. - You don't work today?

224
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,080
Well... Not until later at night.

225
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,620
I have filming tonight.

226
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,190
- Oh, is that right? - Yes.

227
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,690
So you're free right now.

228
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,890
Are you free now? Where is your house?

229
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,990
- It's Seogyo-dong. - Gosh, that's so close.

230
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,260
- Na Rae. - What is this about?

231
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,130
What year were you born in?

232
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,630
- I was born in 1985. - Okay, 1985.

233
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,770
And your gender?

234
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,740
(What is Na Rae's gender?)

235
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,240
What? Gender? I'm probably a female.

236
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,840
That's a success for now then.

237
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,580
So you have time right now.

238
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,980
Yes. What is this about?

239
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,710
Tell her to wait about five minutes.

240
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,380
I'll call you in five minutes.

241
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,620
I'll call you after five minutes, so go back to sleep.

242
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,260
- Okay. - Hey, I can smell...

243
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,020
your bad breath even through this phone.

244
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,390
(Being careful)

245
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,300
It's just my feeling, right?

246
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,730
Sure.

247
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,500
Okay, I'll call you later.

248
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,930
- Okay. - Bye.

249
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,000
(They succeed in casting Na Rae.)

250
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,600
(So Min is calling someone.)

251
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,810
Hello.

252
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,710
I'm so sorry for calling you after such a long time.

253
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,480
I'm filming Running Man now.

254
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,220
- Ji Ho. - Oh, now?

255
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,690
(Is it Oh Ji Ho?)

256
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,260
Hello. Ji Hyo's with me now.

257
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,490
Hello, Ji Ho. I'm Song Ji Hyo.

258
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,900
- Oh, hello. - We're filming now.

259
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,370
You were born in the 70s, right?

260
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,630
- Yes. - Okay, thanks!

261
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,240
Can we go meet you for a second?

262
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,640
You'll come to where I am?

263
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,710
- Where are you? - Where are you?

264
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,380
I'm at a department store in Gangnam.

265
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,950
- So you're in Gangnam. - Gangnam.

266
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,080
Okay, then we'll go to where you are now.

267
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,120
Let's go.

268
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,890
- Thank goodness. - We found our target.

269
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,260
(They move to meet Ji Ho.)

270
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,960
He keeps texting me.

271
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,460
(He must be surprised by the sudden cast.)

272
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,000
So how should I clear my mission?

273
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,070
This is going to be tough.

274
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,800
Is your mission okay?

275
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,110
No, my mission isn't easy either.

276
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,710
(They're now worried about their missions.)

277
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,940
I'm in trouble.

278
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,280
So Min, don't think about betraying me.

279
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,950
I won't betray you. Why would I betray you?

280
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,350
I want to get along with you...

281
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,650
and be on your side.

282
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,950
What?

283
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,620
(She likes to be on someone's side.)

284
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,060
I didn't know you liked that stuff.

285
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,390
So Min, I didn't know that.

286
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,730
I'd like to be on your side.

287
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,630
- Let's try calling him now. - Shall we?

288
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,400
Tell him that we're almost there.

289
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,470
The number you have dialed...

290
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,980
(His phone is turned off?)

291
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,350
(They're about to arrive, and his phone is off.)

292
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,610
His phone is turned off.

293
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,310
- What? - Goodness.

294
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,620
What happened?

295
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,680
His phone is...

296
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,850
Hold on. It can't be.

297
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,820
(She tries calling him again.)

298
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,560
(The phone is turned off. Leave a message after the beep.)

299
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,760
What should we do?

300
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,630
Did he turn it off on purpose?

301
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,730
He must not have done it on purpose.

302
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,200
No, right?

303
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,670
No way.

304
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,740
- That can't be. - No way.

305
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,440
- If he turned it off on purpose, - Let's try calling him again later.

306
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,040
then I'll have to think back on my life.

307
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,640
I'll really have to think back on my life.

308
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,950
Goodness.

309
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,680
I once had to wait...

310
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,490
for my crush at a place where we promised to meet,

311
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,320
but he did not show up.

312
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,890
Goodness.

313
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,790
- It happened to me several times. - Goodness.

314
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,800
You're so hilarious.

315
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,400
- The phone is turned off. - Gosh, what should we do?

316
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,630
(He's still out of reach.)

317
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,370
I can't help but laugh now.

318
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,810
Did he turn his phone off on purpose?

319
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,040
- No, right? - I'm worried he might be waiting.

320
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,780
- I know. - He might not know about this.

321
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,380
Text him, and see if he answers.

322
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,350
(Do they have to wait for his call or move to somewhere else?)

323
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,780
- The phone's turned off. - Daddy.

324
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,120
- Hello? - Ji Ho.

325
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,750
- Ji Ho, where are you? - Ji Ho.

326
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,190
(Ji Ho is back!)

327
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,890
- Ji Ho, where are you? - Ji Ho.

328
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,100
Your phone was turned off.

329
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,660
I'm about to cry now.

330
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,860
(It's like a reunion with their brother after 10 years.)

331
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,970
We were so surprised. We're nearby.

332
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,540
We're near the place.

333
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,600
- What? - Do you have time?

334
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,810
I do.

335
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,180
We're right in front of the department store.

336
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,610
(Ji Ho, we're on our way.)

337
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,810
Where is he?

338
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,480
Let's go.

339
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,150
(Ji Ho, we're on our way.)

340
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,420
Hi, Ji Ho.

341
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,620
(She's so glad to see him.)

342
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,950
Hi, Ji Ho.

343
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,190
- Hello, Ji Ho. - Hi.

344
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,190
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

345
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,590
(Actor Oh Ji Ho)

346
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,760
Your daughter got so big.

347
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,530
- Right. - Say hello.

348
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,830
- Hi. - Your phone was turned off.

349
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,130
- It freaked us out. - Why...

350
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,770
- I mean... - We just filmed a drama.

351
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,940
Sorry...

352
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,480
My daughter put it in airplane mode.

353
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,340
It freaked us out.

354
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,710
Thanks to you, we were able to film a drama out of it.

355
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,210
Thank you so much.

356
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,450
- Sorry. - Hi.

357
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,720
Each of us have a mission to clear with you.

358
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,320
You need to find out what that is.

359
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,520
(Who will clear the hidden mission first between the two?)

360
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,890
Sook. Take your time.

361
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:49,730
(She's on her way to clear our missions.)

362
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:50,840
Sook.

363
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,100
Hi, Sook.

364
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,270
(She's here to meet them even though they asked her so suddenly.)

365
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,410
Sook, sorry.

366
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,780
(She's here to meet them even though they asked her so suddenly.)

367
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,050
- It's even raining. - Thank you.

368
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,380
(Comedienne Kim Sook)

369
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,850
- It's raining. - Gosh.

370
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,480
You came out right away.

371
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,550
(They woke her up on this rainy day.)

372
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,750
You came straight out from your sleep.

373
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,090
- Is your house near here? - Yes.

374
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,290
Where is it?

375
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,430
When did you move here?

376
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,690
- Please don't bother me. - When did you move?

377
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,460
It's Jae Seok's birthday today.

378
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,770
What? August 14.

379
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,330
- Right. - It's right.

380
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,270
- It's your birthday. - Thanks.

381
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,810
- Thanks for coming. - August 14.

382
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,470
You gave me a birthday gift by coming here.

383
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,110
Happy Birthday, Jae Seok.

384
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,310
Thanks for coming to my birthday party.

385
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,680
What birthday party?

386
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,580
- Then you should eat something. - This isn't a birthday party.

387
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,550
- No. We already ordered. - Should I order something?

388
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,790
It's your birthday today.

389
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,120
Let's have your birthday party. Should we have a meal?

390
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,930
- Do you want to have lunch? - Lunch?

391
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,260
There are a lot of good restaurants in this area.

392
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,030
- Really? - Yes.

393
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,530
Let's eat.

394
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,530
- I should treat you to a meal. - No, I should treat you.

395
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,840
- You don't make a lot of money. - No, I'll buy then.

396
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,740
- Men don't earn a lot of money. - That's true.

397
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,840
You're buying.

398
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,310
I can't stand men spending money.

399
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,440
That's right. She is very generous.

400
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,510
I ought to buy you a meal. Eat before you go.

401
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,880
(He's only observing the situation.)

402
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,050
- Now is the time. - Oh, my.

403
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,150
(Thus began a beef brisket party out of the blue.)

404
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,420
Have I ever had beef brisket for lunch?

405
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,590
- Who knew I'd be having this? - Do you want the sauce?

406
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,330
You don't want the sauce?

407
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:26,360
I'm happy to buy you a meal for your birthday.

408
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,900
It's a nice meal for my birthday.

409
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,270
(What on earth...)

410
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:37,310
(are we doing here?)

411
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,940
Let me go to the bathroom.

412
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,680
- Where's the bathroom? - It's outside.

413
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,110
Okay.

414
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,320
(Great. This is my chance.)

415
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,150
(Since his competition has left, he begins his scheme.)

416
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,660
(My face has to be splashed with water.)

417
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,290
Eat up, Kwang Soo. Do you have meat?

418
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,030
(He's displaying his conning skill he has been mastering.)

419
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,830
- What is it? - It's nothing.

420
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,200
- Did the oil get into your eye? - Yes.

421
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,270
Oh, no. What should we do?

422
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,740
- Are you okay? - Do you have eye drops?

423
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,010
- Sorry? - Do you have eye drops?

424
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,380
- No, I don't. - Should I pour some water?

425
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,110
What should we do?

426
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,850
Should I pour some water on it?

427
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,210
- Yes. - Should I?

428
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,220
- Look at me. - Is my eye red?

429
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,350
(Splashing)

430
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,090
- I have to pour a lot on it. - Really?

431
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,190
- Are you okay? - I think I'm okay.

432
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,230
- It doesn't feel hot now? - No, it doesn't.

433
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,990
- Then you're okay. - Thank you.

434
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,930
(Hey, I just accomplished my mission.)

435
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,100
Kwang Soo, you have accomplished the mission.

436
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,370
- You... - Sook.

437
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,040
I'll call you.

438
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,610
What is going on?

439
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,310
(I'll get going. Finish the meal with Jae Seok.)

440
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,610
I have to finish the meal.

441
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,880
- Sook. Yes, I know. - We ordered three servings.

442
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,180
- Did Jae Seok leave? - No, he didn't.

443
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,650
Did he finish his mission and leave?

444
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,980
- He finished and left? - Yes.

445
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,390
(Where... When...)

446
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,020
Goodness, he's a total jerk.

447
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,660
- What is this? - Jae Seok left!

448
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,560
Goodness. Sook...

449
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,760
(Oh, my. How can she...)

450
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:05,760
How could she grab me by the collar as soon as she walked in?

451
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,970
Goodness, that surprised me. I was about to scream and just leave.

452
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,870
(The moment they met Sook at the cafe)

453
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,240
(Sook came in looking angry.)

454
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,880
(She grabbed him by the collar right away.)

455
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,050
(Sook, that was excellent.)

456
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,120
(Jae Seok got up pretending to go to the bathroom.)

457
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,460
(See you later, Kwang Soo.)

458
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,290
Hold on.

459
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,830
(Without knowing this, Kwang Soo was trying hard.)

460
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,300
He really left like that?

461
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,270
He left? What was the mission?

462
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,370
(Oh, no. What am I going to do?)

463
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,440
Eat up.

464
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,570
(Anyways, eat up.)

465
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,110
Really?

466
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,480
Eat before you go.

467
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,280
(Kwang Soo and Sook ate 3 servings of beef brisket.)

468
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,980
I'll call Na Rae.

469
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,850
(Haha and Se Chan came to meet Na Rae.)

470
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,590
Hello.

471
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,590
Na Rae.

472
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,590
Hello, Haha.

473
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,730
Did you put on makeup?

474
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,060
- Sorry? - Are you wearing makeup?

475
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,030
No, I didn't do anything.

476
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,630
- Really? - Tell her to just come out.

477
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,240
- Do I have to wear makeup? - No, that's not necessary.

478
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,040
But you have to look pretty on camera.

479
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,510
- Do I look repulsive without it? - No, you don't.

480
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,750
No, I just thought it might be helpful if you looked your best.

481
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:30,920
- No, I don't need to be helpful. - You don't?

482
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,490
Na Rae, can we film at your house?

483
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,220
- At my house? - Yes.

484
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,860
Or we can film outside. It doesn't really matter.

485
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,190
But what are you filming now?

486
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,530
We are not doing much. We are just...

487
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,660
- We are just going to catch up. - That's right.

488
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,560
- We're going to catch up? - Yes.

489
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,900
It doesn't have to be your bedroom. What about Se Chan's room?

490
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,910
What are you talking about? Stop it.

491
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,440
I've never been to her house.

492
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,210
My house is such a mess. But we can film it upstairs, can't we?

493
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,280
- Upstairs? - That works too.

494
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,450
- It's not a problem at all. - I got it.

495
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,820
Then we can talk upstairs.

496
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,290
- Thank you. - Send us your address.

497
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,190
- Okay. - Thank you.

498
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,890
- She's so kind. - She's so cool.

499
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,320
(They are on their way to Na Rae's house.)

500
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,630
(They arrive at her place.)

501
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,230
Goodness, she's a professional. She left the door open.

502
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,870
She's an expert. She wanted us to walk in naturally.

503
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,870
Does she leave it open when you come?

504
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,010
Stop talking nonsense. It's my first time here too. I'm serious.

505
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,480
I've never been here. Why would I go to Na Rae's house?

506
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,980
Let's do our best.

507
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,050
- Haha, don't interfere. - Okay, okay.

508
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,750
She left the door open. I'm telling you. She's an expert.

509
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,060
What is that? Gosh, that startled me.

510
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,690
- What was that? - Goodness.

511
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,760
(What have I just seen?)

512
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,260
Haha, let's get out of here. It's scary in here.

513
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,930
- This is so weird. - Her house is so scary.

514
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,900
- Look at this. - It's like a haunted house.

515
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,600
Take a look inside.

516
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,240
What is that? What is it?

517
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,380
(Who are you?)

518
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,280
- What is it? - It's a cardboard cutout of her.

519
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,250
- A cardboard cutout? - Gosh, that scared me.

520
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,450
I was so surprised.

521
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,520
(The cardboard cutout is protecting the gate like a guardian.)

522
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,190
(The actual person, scarier than the cardboard cutout, appears.)

523
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,460
Why are you so late?

524
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,660
(Park Na Rae, a comedienne born in 1985)

525
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,900
Put that cardboard cutout away before I kick it.

526
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,000
- Why? - Let's go in. Thank you by the way.

527
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,170
Thank you for inviting us in.

528
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,740
- This is the famous Narae's Bar. - That's right.

529
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,340
- This is it? - This is the bar,

530
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,070
and this is the DJ booth.

531
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,810
(There's a mirror ball and a booth. It's as good as any other club.)

532
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,240
Na Rae. Well...

533
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,710
- Can you lighten up the room? - No, I can't.

534
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,150
- No, I can't do that. - Children watch our show.

535
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,450
My house can't have bright lights.

536
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,450
Oh, my.

537
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,720
There are small things here.

538
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,550
- Is this your guesthouse? - Yes.

539
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,790
(A world-wide collection of liquors)

540
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,020
Goodness. This is...

541
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,260
This is like Na Rae's Bed and Breakfast.

542
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,530
Even your outfit looks like an owner of a bed and breakfast.

543
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,400
(This is the trendy outfit of bed and breakfasts' owners.)

544
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,300
I need a guy like Lee Sang Soon.

545
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,940
- And that guy is you. - Stop it.

546
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,570
- Cut it out. Stop it. - You're my Sang Soon.

547
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,470
That's enough. People will look us up online then.

548
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,340
Haha, coming here wasn't a good idea for me.

549
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,210
Na Rae, this place is awesome.

550
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,350
In summer, this is a good place to hang out.

551
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,920
(Look at how spacious it is.)

552
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,250
Goodness, it's so hot.

553
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,490
The ceiling might be too low for others, but it's perfect for you.

554
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,860
Of course, but doesn't that apply to Haha too?

555
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,430
I'm sure it does.

556
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,730
- That's true. - He'll fit perfectly.

557
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,870
What is that projector? Is that for watching movies?

558
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:35,900
Yes.

559
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,000
With whom do you watch movies?

560
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,870
I ought to watch them with you.

561
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,040
(Do you want to watch a movie?)

562
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,580
It's been eight months since I moved here. I'm not lying.

563
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,680
- I've never watched a film here. - Really?

564
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,380
I didn't have anyone to watch it with.

565
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,680
(This is a dangerous place.)

566
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,520
You know,

567
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,490
- Se Chan gives me goose bumps. - Why?

568
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,260
It's so surprising how he's acting like this is his first time here.

569
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,460
- It's my first time, Haha. - I'm serious.

570
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,900
- Exactly. - He's surprising me today.

571
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,100
This is my first time coming here.

572
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,600
It's true. I haven't even been to her previous house.

573
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,170
Just take your pants.

574
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,640
(I'm just kidding.)

575
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,910
I was just joking.

576
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,410
(This is a joke that she wished was true.)

577
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,820
You look cute without makeup.

578
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,450
- Where does she look cute? - She has a cute face.

579
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,490
(He's touching the water bottle for his mission.)

580
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,620
No, she looks terrible right now.

581
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,060
Hey, don't make me angry.

582
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,330
(He gets rid of any chance for Se Chan to do his mission.)

583
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,330
What's going on?

584
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,970
He got to me.

585
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,640
What's going on? Is that alcohol or what?

586
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,840
What are you doing?

587
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,870
(He empties the bottle completely.)

588
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,970
What was that?

589
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:52,010
- What was that about? - That was my water bottle.

590
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,050
- Do you have water? - Sorry?

591
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,180
- Do you have water? - Do you want some water?

592
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,320
- No. - I'll get you water.

593
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,920
- Get me cold water then. - Okay.

594
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,950
Thanks.

595
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,820
- Why did they come here? - Na Rae, come here quickly.

596
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,190
- Get me some water, please. - I'll be back.

597
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,260
- Na Rae. - Yes.

598
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,390
- Please bring me cold water. - Na Rae, hold on.

599
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:11,330
Haha, I'm sorry, but I only listen to my husband.

600
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,870
Haha.

601
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,040
Haha, why did you drink up all my water? Why?

602
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,640
- Na Rae. - Yes?

603
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,210
Don't you think you're being unfair?

604
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:24,840
- What are you talking about? - I mean...

605
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,110
I think I can see that...

606
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:32,450
some other men stayed at your house other than Se Chan.

607
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,620
- Goodness. What are you saying? - I mean...

608
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,220
How could you do that when you're with Se Chan?

609
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,360
How could you see other men?

610
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,830
- Haha, let's come clean now. - Honey.

611
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,300
(A soap opera unfolds.)

612
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,660
What's going on between you two?

613
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,130
- Tell me. - I...

614
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,000
- What's going on between you two? - Nothing's going on.

615
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,170
Don't do it.

616
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,000
- Tell me now. - Just tell him now.

617
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,510
- Tell him everything now. Tell him! - Honey.

618
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,140
- I can't. - Come here. Go upstairs.

619
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,880
Go upstairs, and tell him what happened between us.

620
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,450
- What kind of skit is this? - Na Rae.

621
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,920
- Sit down. - What's the mission?

622
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,990
Take a seat. If you have something to tell me,

623
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,060
go ahead.

624
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,260
Let's date.

625
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,190
- What? - This was the mission.

626
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,390
You filthy animal.

627
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,860
(Haha is feeling impatient.)

628
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,000
- Hold on. Na Rae. - Yes.

629
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,140
- Don't you remember how we greet? - I do.

630
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,170
- It's an unusual way of saying hi. - That's true.

631
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,910
Then let's say hello to each other.

632
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,140
Get up.

633
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,980
Na Rae and I just met.

634
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,510
- Oh, my, Haha. - It's different. Oh, my!

635
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,680
- Nice to see you - Nice to see you

636
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,920
(Haha is grabbed by the collar.)

637
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,950
(Haha wins 10 dollars.)

638
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,290
(Has he completed his mission?)

639
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,290
What is this?

640
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:47,890
What is this?

641
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,590
What?

642
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,600
(Could this be...)

643
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,470
(Splash)

644
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,700
Thank you. I'll be nice.

645
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:02,610
Thank you, ma'am.

646
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,040
- Get out of my house. - I will.

647
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,310
- "Get out"? - I want to clean up,

648
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,550
but I have to go.

649
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,950
- Get out. - Thank you.

650
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,180
What is going on?

651
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,350
- Thank you. - Na Rae,

652
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,480
I'll come over again.

653
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,950
Se Chan, take your pants.

654
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:14,950
(I know you're in a hurry but...)

655
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,520
What pants?

656
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,890
Why are you in such a hurry?

657
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,890
(We appreciate Na Rae's cooperation.)

658
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,630
This mission is too difficult.

659
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,130
It is.

660
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,600
- They're shooting. - Hi.

661
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,770
- Hi. - Hi.

662
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,870
- Hi. - Hi.

663
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:34,270
(Whom are they visiting?)

664
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,610
- Hi, Eun Ji. - Eun Ji.

665
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,940
Hi. Sorry for the trouble.

666
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,680
(Jeong Eun Ji from Apink)

667
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,380
- Eun Ji. - Yes?

668
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,080
Why don't we play a game?

669
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,450
- Sure. - As soon as you arrive?

670
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,150
- Running Man... - What game?

671
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,890
- We play games on Running Man. - It's too obvious.

672
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,360
- What are you doing? - What?

673
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,190
- You're acting weird. - What's with your cap?

674
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,160
It's nothing. Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

675
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,830
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

676
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
(Jong Kook wins.)

677
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,570
Best 2 out of 3. Rock-paper-scissors.

678
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,640
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

679
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,970
(Jong Kook wins again.)

680
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,410
Best 3 out of 5.

681
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,980
- Play with me. - Why are you so bad at it?

682
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,680
Why are you so bad?

683
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,780
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Eun Ji.

684
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,950
(Jong Kook finally loses.)

685
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,950
- Okay. - Eun Ji.

686
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,050
- Look. - What is this?

687
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,560
On Running Man, you get hit on the forehead as penalty.

688
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,260
(You didn't know, right?)

689
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,690
- Really? - Yes.

690
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,690
(Was your mission getting hit on the forehead too?)

691
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,530
- Are you sure it's okay? - Of course.

692
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,800
- I can hit you very hard. - It's funnier that way.

693
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,870
(Jong Kook is so happy to be hit on the forehead.)

694
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,670
(Hitting)

695
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,540
- Eun Ji. - What is this?

696
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,880
- What is going on? - I succeeded.

697
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,880
(Jong Kook wins 10 dollars.)

698
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,410
I have to go now.

699
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,620
- Okay. - Where are you going?

700
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,720
Thank you.

701
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,550
Eun Ji is the best.

702
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,790

706
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,890
(Jong Kook heads to the opening venue.)

707
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,160

I'm leaving first. Let's go.

710
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,870
(Sorry, Seok Jin. I'm leaving.)

711
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,640
Let's go.

712
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,410
(Running)

713
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,410
Where is he?

714
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,410
Has he left?

715
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,150
Has he?

716
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,250
Gosh, he's unbelievable.

717
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,720
How could he leave?

718
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,550

(Thanks, Na Rae.)

725
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:46,270
When you're in a hurry, you get stuck at the lights.

726
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,440
It's strange.

727
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,480
Thank you.

728
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,450

Only them? What about me?

746
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,620
(You said the first 4 people would win the money.)

747
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,890
What happened?

748
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,590
Ji Hyo, what are you doing there?

749
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,290
(Ji Hyo and So Min, what are you doing there?)

750
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,700
(An hour earlier)

751
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,970
My forehead is so hot.

752
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,870
Right? "Mom"?

753
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:50,870
(Hitting)

754
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,370
What is this?

755
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,510
Thank you.

756
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,270

Drink some water. It's new.

759
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,450
I'm done. I'm sorry.

760
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,890
We're the first ones. Let's hurry.

761
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,020
Hurry.

766
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,070

(Good job, guys.)

770
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,610
You guys...

771
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,150

772
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,450
(Mission Money)

773
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,050
(SBS Prism Tower in Sangam-dong)

774
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:47,160
This morning, you completed missions assigned by the roulette wheel.

775
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,530
- Yes. - Today, a new project will start.

776
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,100
(A new...)

777
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,440
(project?)

778
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,170
- Again? - Following the first two tours,

779
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,380
the third global project is called...

780
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,080
Half and Half Tour.

781
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,680
(Half and Half Tour)

782
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,050
- Half and Half? - I want to go this time.

783
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,550
I was thinking of another name.

784
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,350
- I'm getting tired. - Isn't it just the same thing?

785
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,690
Shouldn't the name be Psycho Tour?

786
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,090
(Psycho Tour instead of Half and Half Tour)

787
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,460
- Psycho? - Psycho?

788
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,260
- Are we penalized all year around? - What is this?

789
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,700
We haven't even left yet.

790
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,260
Let's think after we come back from Indonesia.

791
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,000
- This is too much. - The Indonesia trip...

792
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,570
is scheduled in September.

793
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,540
First of all, please bring in the roulette wheel.

794
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,570
(Roulette wheel?)

795
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,570
- What? - Right now?

796
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,180
- We should burn all those wheels. - Roulette wheels again?

797
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,880
I don't like roulette wheels anymore.

798
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,450
We spin it right away?

799
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,450

We asked each of you...

804
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,090
- where you wanted to go. - That's right.

805
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:59,960
There are eight destinations you recommended...

806
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,670
and eight other destinations...

807
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,640
that were not chosen in the first two projects.

808
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,540

811
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,620
- Not many get to visit there. - I'd love to visit.

812
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,620
It sounds great.

813
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,250
- It's hard to find time otherwise. - Rome sounds nice.

814
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,390
- Colosseum. - That's right.

815
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,490
You have to visit there once in your life.

816
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,030
I can't wait.

817
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,000
Look at that.

You don't get to visit a place like that otherwise.

00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,980
That's the place I want.

827
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,820
Where's that?

828
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,620

882
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,180
What is it?

883
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,590
(And)

884
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,790
(8 scary destinations chosen by the staff)

885
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,590
Oh, those places.

886
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,960
(Do you remember?)

887
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:21,300
(Spain, New Zealand, US, Indonesia, Australia, Brazil, Mexico)

888
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,470
(The world's tallest swing)

889
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,800
- What's that? - I remember now.

890
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,910
- What's that? - Have we seen it before?

891
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,570
We've seen it.

892
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,080
- Gosh. - Gosh.

893
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,810
- You show it to us every week. - We can never forget.

894
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:33,810
That place is included again.

895
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,110
Why do you relieve your stress on us?

896
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,680
(It's a 14-story, vertical water slide.)

897
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,180
- I can't do it. - I'll go.

898
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,820
- I can't do it. - It's in Brazil.

899
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,550
(Insano Water Slide in Brazil)

900
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,820
- That's impossible. - It looks intense.

901
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,560
Where is that?

902
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,960
Is it Copper Canyon again?

903
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,930
Didn't it disappear?

904
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,500
It's an active volcano in Indonesia.

905
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,600
Why would you visit an active volcano?

906
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,670
Why did they hang a hammock at an altitude of 2,078m?

907
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
Why would you do it?

908
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,770
I don't like hammocks.

909
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,510
- It's a zip-line. - Look at that.

910
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,240
Goodness.

911
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,380
- I'd go. - I can do it.

912
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,250
I couldn't do it in Dubai.

913
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,920
- What's this? - Come on.

914
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,480
Is that a free fall?

915
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,820
That must be thrilling.

916
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,520
How did they even find it?

917
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,290
- Seriously. - How did they even find it?

918
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,190
(Extremely anxious)

919
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,930
- What should we do? - I can't go.

920
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:24,930
How can we go?

921
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,000
Remember that, Kwang Soo.

922
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,530
Why are you telling me?

923
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,400
- Why are you telling me this? - I can't go.

924
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,100
- I can't go either. - Remember that.

925
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,110
We took a look at eight locations.

926
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,480
Every week, it will be...

927
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,050
places recommended by the members versus by staff.

928
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,850
If you win, a place recommended by you will be selected.

929
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,180
Mine is great.

930
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,750
If the staff wins,

931
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,320
a place recommended by the staff will be selected.

932
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,190
It'll be recorded on the roulette.

933
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,290
- Is that so? - Yes.

934
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,160
The member to be sent to the location...

935
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,130
will be selected by spinning the roulette.

936
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,930
Every week, the final winner of the mission...

937
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,830
will purchase a name tag and attach it on the roulette.

938
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,840
He selects a member to go to the location by spinning it.

939
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,540
(The member to be selected is sent to a designated location.)

940
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,640
- We purchase the name tag. - We have to buy it.

941
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,510
(A member may be selected multiple times.)

942
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,610
I see.

943
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:15,150
Once the members and locations are determined,

944
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,720
Half and Half Tour will end.

945
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,520
You determine the final location by spinning the roulette.

946
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,590
Selected members choose another member to accompany them.

947
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,260
- They will go together. - We get to select someone else.

948
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,890
(The chosen member can choose another member.)

949
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,730
Before we start the mission,

950
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:34,400
you will choose the location for today's competition.

951
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,530
- Do we have to select one? - Let's go together.

952
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,270
Locations recommended by you are on the left.

953
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,870
The red ones are recommended by the staff.

954
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,110
Decide who will pick...

955
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,040
- from each side. - This is stressful.

956
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,880
I don't feel good about it.

957
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,950
Pick a good one.

958
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,750
- How? - Which do you want?

959
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,450
- Pick Canada. - Which do you want?

960
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,150
- Australia. - Let's go to Alaska.

961
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,650
Let's see.

962
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,860
- One has to be good. - Pick Canada.

963
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,490
- Show it to us. - Let it be Alaska.

964
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,330
- Canada. - Put it back in.

965
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,760
- Pick again. - It isn't Alaska.

966
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,830
- What is it? - Salar de Uyuni.

967
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,160
- Okay. - It's Salar de Uyuni.

968
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,530
(He picks Salar de Uyuni.)

969
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:09,330
(It's a site that you must visit before you die.)

970
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:11,640
(Se Chan's choice, Salar de Uyuni)

971
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,310
- It's Bolivia. - Bolivia.

972
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,610
- It's Salar de Uyuni. - It's amazing.

973
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,680
- For this one... - I don't want to go.

974
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,680
Avoid places like zip-lining.

975
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,850
It can't be the hammock.

976
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,750
- I don't want free falling. - It can't be the hammock.

977
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,020
(It's time to pick from the other pool.)

978
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:33,590
(Which location recommended by the staff will be selected?)

979
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,730
- Active volcano. - What will it be?

980
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,800
- Pick the active volcano. - Right.

981
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,900
- The active volcano? - Bitten by a crocodile is better.

982
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,730
- Crocodiles are better. - Let's go to the US.

983
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,030
- What is it? - That's great.

984
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,240
- Isn't it the US? - It's New Zealand.

985
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,470
- New Zealand? - Where is it?

986
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,170
- It's Nevis Swing. - It's a ride.

987
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,110
It's Nevis Swing in New Zealand.

988
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,710
- What if it breaks? - It's like bungee-jumping.

989
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:54,810
(Nevis Swing in New Zealand)

990
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:59,420
(Let's jump off a cliff from 160m.)

991
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,490
- New Zealand? - What's in New Zealand?

992
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,120
It's that swing.

993
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,560
- Which one is it? - When it breaks, you fall.

994
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,330
Gosh, we can't do that.

995
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,660
Locations are selected.

996
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,160
This is impossible.

997
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,270
(It's Salar de Uyuni versus Nevis Swing.)

998
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,770
Round One of Half and Half Tour.

999
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:20,440
The result of the mission must be half and half in order to win.

1000
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,710
It has to be half?

1001
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,440
- What does it mean? - It has to be four each.

1002
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,610
It's a competition between members and staff of three rounds.

1003
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:29,810
Based on the result, you gain or lose your mission money.

1004
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,650
If the total mission money is more than 200 dollars,

1005
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,820
Team Running Man wins.

1006
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,990
- We're on one team. - That's right.

1007
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,260
- We're one. - Why did we fight?

1008
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,060
Here's why individual mission money is important.

1009
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,860
The member to obtain the highest amount of mission money...

1010
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,330
is given a chance to purchase a name tag for the roulette.

1011
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:52,770
(Highest mission money gives a chance to purchase a name tag.)

1012
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,010
Money is important.

1013
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:57,040
Sacrificing your gain for the team will be important.

1014
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,580
- Is it individual or team? - Doesn't that mean...

1015
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,110
it's an individual competition?

1016
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,510
(He doesn't think twice about it.)

1017
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,620
- Right? - That's possible.

1018
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,750
I know what I must do.

1019
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,290
(He won't play for the team.)

1020
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,990
If I get selected, I'll travel with you.

1021
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,290
I'll spend all my money on buying your name tag.

1022
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,030
(While expecting competition, they move to the next location.)

1023
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,960
We're heading to a restaurant.

1024
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,600
It's a chance to win additional mission money.

1025
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,370
We'll play Hit or Miss.

1026
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,070
(Round 1 is Hit or Miss.)

1027
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,670
- That sounds great. - Okay.

1028
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,440
(They're determined to compete.)

1029
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,610
What is it?

1030
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,380
You'll play Hit or Miss as a team.

1031
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,220
You win if the result is split into half of the group.

1032
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:43,120
(The result must be split 4 by 4.)

1033
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,320
Different results?

1034
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,730
You can win 10 dollars for each round.

1035
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:48,760
(10 dollars per round)

1036
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,760
That means one of us has to give 10 dollars.

1037
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,630
If you win, we'll give you 10 dollars.

1038
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,530
If you lose, we won't give you any.

1039
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,700
We won't take it from you.

1040
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,500
- Okay. - That's good.

1041
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,800
- Here's Round One. - What is it?

1042
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,770
You must guess odd or even.

1043
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:05,110
(Round One is Guess Odd or Even.)

1044
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:08,980
Guess if the number of coins in my hand is odd or even.

1045
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,820
You succeed if half of you guess correctly and half of you don't.

1046
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,990
You'll win 10 dollars for mission money.

1047
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,150
- This is difficult. - How can we guess?

1048
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,590
- It's a great game. - It's 7 to 3.

1049
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,960
The first four won't be important.

1050
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,830
- Right. - The last four is important.

1051
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,660
Only half of you must guess correctly.

1052
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,560
I'm very bad at this.

1053
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:30,240
In my neighborhood during childhood,

1054
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,670
- I used to play a game... - To divide into teams?

1055
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,270
to divide into groups.

1056
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:38,810
- My friends didn't want me to play. - Was it because you were bad?

1057
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,080
I was terrible at it.

1058
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,810
I lost everything that my friends won.

1059
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,150
I don't like friends like that.

1060
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,880
You shouldn't play to begin with.

1061
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,190
- He should give up his turn. - Right.

1062
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,190
How could you be so tactless?

1063
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,590
He should have gone home.

1064
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,020
You should have gone home.

1065
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,690
- He shouldn't play the game. - He should go home.

1066
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,430
They're so mean.

1067
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,730
(He's very disappointed.)

1068
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,630
Let's start.

1069
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,130
(They start the game including Jae Seok.)

1070
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,200
Seok Jin is up.

1071
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,570
I bought a lot of bread...

1072
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,840
with money I earned from this game.

1073
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,240
- We know by the sound. - It's odd.

1074
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,610
- Three coins. - It's even.

1075
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:10,180
(The opinions differ.)

1076
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,240
(It's an odd number.)

1077
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,250
- Odd. - He got it.

1078
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,480
- We don't know yet. - You got it right.

1079
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,350
- Should I guess wrong? - That's okay.

1080
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,850
You can guess either way. It doesn't matter now.

1081
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,550
Guess however you'd like.

1082
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,290
Right, wrong, right, wrong is the best.

1083
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,520
Come on.

1084
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,890
- That's the best. - Even.

1085
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,590
- That's incorrect. - It's okay.

1086
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:29,030
- Okay. - We got one wrong.

1087
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,800
- We got one wrong. - You're on the staff's side,

1088
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,700
aren't you?

1089
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,100
(You're on the staff's side.)

1090
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,670
(What does he mean?)

1091
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,170
- It's right and wrong. - He did well.

1092
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,640
- You did a good job. - Really?

1093
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,840
We have 1 right and 1 wrong.

1094
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,470
They criticize you even when you did well.

1095
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:45,510
(Kwang Soo is surprised.)

1096
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,810
What he did made it easier.

1097
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:50,050
1 right, 1 wrong is good.

1098
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,750
I'm losing confidence.

1099
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,250
(It's Ji Hyo's turn.)

1100
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,790
- I bet it's two. - It's even.

1101
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:58,160
- Even? - I think it's two.

1102
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,320
I think it's odd.

1103
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,560
- Do what you think is right. - It's up to you.

1104
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,760
It's okay for now.

1105
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,100
- Go. - I think it's two.

1106
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,460
- Even. - Even?

1107
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,900
- Yes. - I think it's odd.

1108
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:08,670
My guess is...

1109
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,370
- even. - Even.

1110
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:13,510
(Ji Hyo's guess is even, but it's odd.)

1111
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,170
- It's okay. - You were right.

1112
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,880
Do you see why I always lost?

1113
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,710
(He speaks with confidence.)

1114
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:23,150
Can you please be quiet?

1115
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,480
- Stop calling out your guesses. - Okay.

1116
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,850
So Min should guess correctly.

1117
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,360
- Chul Min is good at shuffling. - Right.

1118
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,390
- Even. - It's odd.

1119
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:32,460
- It's even. - Even.

1120
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,560
He knows the answer.

1121
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,590
- Even. - It's odd.

1122
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,630
- It's even. - Even.

1123
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,730
He knows the answer.

1124
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,870
(It's even indeed.)

1125
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,570
The members in the front row are split in half.

1126
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,400
(The result is split in half.)

1127
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,640
Go.

1128
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,210
(They're close to winning 10 dollars.)

1129
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:51,340
It's even.

1130
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,180
Chul Min took out one coin.

1131
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,150
- It doesn't matter what I guess. - No.

1132
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,320
It's even.

1133
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,020
(Haha's guess is even.)

1134
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,520
- It's odd. - Okay.

1135
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,760
(There are three coins.)

1136
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,920
It was incorrect.

1137
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,490
- Shall I guess correctly? - Yes.

1138
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:08,830
- You must guess correctly. - Is that so?

1139
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:11,000
(They have 2 right and 3 wrong.)

1140
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,130
It's odd.

1141
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:18,400
(Is it a correct guess or not?)

1142
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,600
That's incorrect.

1143
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,770
Must I guess incorrectly?

1144
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,170
Both of you must guess correctly.

1145
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:24,840
(They have 2 right and 4 wrong.)

1146
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,280
Must I guess incorrectly?

1147
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,510
- Both of you must guess correctly. - This will determine the result.

1148
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,420
Is it over if I guess incorrectly?

1149
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,550
(If Se Chan is wrong, the game is over.)

1150
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:34,090
I played this game a lot in Dongducheon.

1151
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:35,720
(He feels confident.)

1152
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:38,520
(He claims to be a king of Guess Odd or Even in Dongducheon.)

1153
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,590
(Will he guess correctly?)

1154
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,360
It's odd.

1155
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,230
I think it's even.

1156
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:50,400
(His guess is correct.)

1157
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,170
Okay, what did I tell you?

1158
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,310
I was good in Dongducheon.

1159
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:55,840
Jong Kook.

1160
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,440
Come on, Jong Kook.

1161
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,840
We win if you guess correctly.

1162
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,710
- I'll guess correctly. - He was good in Anyang.

1163
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,110
This is easy.

1164
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,080
- He was the best in Anyang. - I didn't play this game.

1165
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,090
I told people to give me money.

1166
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:09,990
(I told people to give me money.)

1167
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:12,390
(He makes people want to give to him.)

1168
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,160
Do you know what's amazing?

1169
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:16,560
My guesses have been wrong all along.

1170
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,430
He always called out the wrong guesses.

1171
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:20,730
(He was always wrong.)

1172
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:25,340
(When he called out even, it's odd.)

1173
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:29,770
(When he called out odd, it's even.)

1174
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:33,510
(His guess was always incorrect.)

1175
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,550
- Odd. - It must be odd.

1176
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,880
It must be even if Jae Seok chose odd.

1177
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,590
- Should Jong Kook be wrong? - Odd.

1178
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:42,820
- I should be right. - He should be right.

1179
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,890
Odd.

1180
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,020
(Will...)

1181
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:52,800
(Jong Kook's answer be correct?)

1182
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:59,170
(Even)

1183
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:01,970
See? Jae Seok chose "odd". It means it's even.

1184
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:04,880
Please stay out of this.

1185
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,950
We're having fun.

1186
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:08,750
You're not helping us.

1187
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:11,220
- Just go home. - What's with you?

1188
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,920
Go home, and wash yourself.

1189
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,120
- You've been wrong every time. - Go home.

1190
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,090
Go to bed early. We'll hang out by ourselves.

1191
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:18,920
You know what?

1192
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,730
It's Jae Seok's birthday today.

1193
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:23,130
I'm sorry.

1194
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:24,200
It's his birthday.

1195
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,500
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

1196
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,670
We just told him to go home.

1197
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,740
- We were so harsh to him. - Happy birthday dear Jae Seok

1198
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,110
I can't believe it.

1199
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:38,740
My goodness.

1200
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:42,110
How was I wrong every time?

1201
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:44,250
All right. As it's Jae Seok's birthday today,

1202
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,790
- One more chance? - if Jae Seok...

1203
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:48,850
What if he has to be wrong every time?

1204
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:51,820
If you're right 2 out of 3 times, we'll give you 10 dollars.

1205
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,790
- All right. - That sounds good.

1206
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:55,890
Is it a team competition?

1207
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:57,900
If you're right 2 out of 3 times, you'll win 10 dollars.

1208
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:58,900
Good luck.

1209
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,800
You should overcome this.

1210
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,730
Choose the opposite of what you think.

1211
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:04,140
What if that's wrong too?

1212
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,940
- It's your birthday. - I'll listen to you.

1213
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,840
- What do you want to choose? - I want to choose "odd".

1214
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:10,010
Even.

1215
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:14,010
(Jae Seok chooses the opposite of his initial choice.)

1216
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:18,150
(Will he be right this time?)

1217
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,450
(Odd)

1218
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:24,160
It's the opposite of what you say.

1219
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,490
It's the opposite of your choice.

1220
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:28,330
It's the opposite of your final decision.

1221
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:31,400
- Don't do anything. - Not your first decision.

1222
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,930
- Final decision. - The opposite of my final decision?

1223
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,400
The opposite of your final decision.

1224
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,800
- How can he be wrong again? - The opposite of my...

1225
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,840
- final decision. - Final decision.

1226
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,740
- The opposite of your answer. - Okay.

1227
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,280
- Jae Seok. - Make up your mind first.

1228
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,210
I have a strong hunch that it's even.

1229
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,410
- I'd like to choose "even". - But you'd choose "odd".

1230
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:50,250
- I'd choose "odd". - But it'd be even.

1231
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,520
- My final decision... - In the end, it's odd.

1232
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,320
would be "even".

1233
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,950
It's odd then.

1234
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:57,090
Odd.

1235
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,730
(How will his second try turn out?)

1236
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:03,860
This is hilarious.

1237
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,830
(It's odd.)

1238
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,870
(The opposite of Jae Seok's final decision)

1239
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:10,440
This was it.

1240
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,200
- This was it. - Try one more time.

1241
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,540
- The opposite of your decision. - The opposite...

1242
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,340
of my final decision.

1243
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:21,150
- The opposite of my final decision. - Final decision.

1244
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,510
I didn't know this game...

1245
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,080
- was so mathematical. - Me neither.

1246
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,020
- The opposite of my final decision. - Final decision.

1247
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,420
(There is only one chance left.)

1248
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,260
- What's your first thought? - What do you think?

1249
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,490
I have a strong hunch that it's even.

1250
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:33,930
Then you'd say, "odd".

1251
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:37,360
- I'd say, "odd", but... - You'd say, "even".

1252
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,930
I'd say, "even".

1253
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:42,000
- Then you'd choose, "odd". - It's the opposite of that.

1254
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,200
Then it should be odd.

1255
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,470
- Then it should be the opposite. - It should be even.

1256
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:47,270
- You should say, "even". - Hold on.

1257
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:50,240
Just say your final decision.

1258
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,680
My final decision is,

1259
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,380
- "odd". - Then it's even.

1260
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,680
- Then it's even. - Even.

1261
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,220
Doesn't it mean that that's your final decision?

1262
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:02,720
What am I supposed to do?

1263
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,020
(There is no end to this.)

1264
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:08,060
Then shout this.

1265
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:09,830
"Odd, even". Then your choice is "even".

1266
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:12,430
- "Odd but even" or "even but odd". - That's right.

1267
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:14,600
It should be the opposite of your hunch.

1268
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:17,100
My hunch is that it's odd.

1269
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,840
- Then it's even. - Then it's even.

1270
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,710
(Then it's even.)

1271
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:23,040
- Shout it. - It's odd.

1272
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,040
- The opposite is "odd". - Say, "even", but it'll be odd.

1273
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:27,310
- It should be odd. - Don't listen.

1274
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:29,850
- Even but odd. - You might win 10 dollars.

1275
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:31,420
(Even but odd)

1276
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:36,490
(It's the last chance. Is he right?)

1277
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,490
(His final decision is "odd".)

1278
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:43,860
- You might win 10 dollars. - Odd.

1279
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:47,870
(Odd)

1280
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,130
(Jae Seok has overcome his bad luck.)

1281
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:50,770
Unbelievable.

1282
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:54,670
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

1283
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:57,780
(They congratulate him on winning 10 dollars.)

1284
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:01,550
It's the opposite of my final decision.

1285
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,520
That's how you overcome bad luck.

1286
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,950
You can fight anything from now on.

1287
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:07,850
- It's the opposite. - It's the opposite.

1288
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:09,350
- I can overcome it. - This was...

1289
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:11,590
the most exciting game today.

1290
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:13,160
The opposite of your final decision.

1291
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:16,230
- We're in front of the restaurant. - Okay.

1292
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,570
You'll go in one by one and choose a dish.

1293
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:22,770
Half and half.

1294
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:24,440
- Is it that game again? - Half and half?

1295
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,440
(Why would they go in one by one?)

1296
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:30,240
(Last time, everyone had to choose a different dish.)

1297
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,150
(Will they be able to settle their score today?)

1298
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:36,610
- I want to eat. - Me too.

1299
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,020
- I'll just choose what I want. - Me too.

1300
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,890
Because you can plot...

1301
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:42,590
- You go first. - Should I go first?

1302
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,760
- I have no idea what this is. - See you.

1303
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:53,060
(What mission will they be given here?)

1304
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,670
Am I to choose between these?

1305
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:01,110
(Fried rice and japchae rice, jjamppong and jajangmyeon)

1306
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:03,040
I'll explain.

1307
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,680
You can eat only if you find a partner.

1308
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,510
The mission is called Eat with Your Half.

1309
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:10,820
(Eat with Your Half)

1310
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,390
Choose one dish.

1311
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:14,950
(Choose 1 among the 4 dishes.)

1312
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:18,660
If someone chooses the other half of the set you choose,

1313
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,960
both of you can eat.

1314
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:26,000
If you don't find a partner, you can't eat.

1315
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,700
(To eat, they need a partner.)

1316
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,070
I have to find a partner?

1317
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:34,010
If you don't find a partner, you can't eat.

1318
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:36,880
- I'll choose jjamppong. - Jjamppong.

1319
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:38,680
- One more thing. - I love jjamppong.

1320
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,480
If you choose jjamppong...

1321
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,450
but more than one person chooses jajangmyeon,

1322
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:44,020
- Does it become a competition? - you can...

1323
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,750
choose one of them.

1324
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:48,750
More people would choose jjamppong than jajangmyeon.

1325
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,290
- Can I change my mind? - Yes.

1326
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,730
I should choose something not many would choose.

1327
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:56,260
That would raise my chance.

1328
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,230
Okay. I choose japchae rice.

1329
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:00,930
- You choose japchae rice. - Japchae rice.

1330
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:03,470
- Please go upstairs. - Okay. Japchae rice.

1331
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:05,400
Someone must choose fried rice.

1332
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,640
(It's Ji Hyo's turn.)

1333
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,640
Oh, my gosh.

1334
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,280
(Why are you doing this to me?)

1335
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,310
Why do you have to do this?

1336
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,550
I choose jajangmyeon. I'm sure someone will...

1337
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:19,750
choose jjamppong.

1338
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,320
(Ji Hyo chooses jajangmyeon.)

1339
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,260
If I choose jjamppong, I need someone who chooses jajangmyeon?

1340
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,730
And If I choose fried rice, I need someone who chooses japchae rice?

1341
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,600
My goodness.

1342
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,570
I love this dish.

1343
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:35,400
(He's in a dilemma.)

1344
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,770
(But he doesn't want to choose what he doesn't like.)

1345
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:45,310
(What will the Chinese food lover choose?)

1346
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,480
I wanted to have jjamppong.

1347
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,320
But I was sure someone else would choose it too.

1348
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,350
I know. I hope someone chooses fried rice.

1349
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:54,420
I'm sure there will be someone.

1350
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,750
Please.

1351
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,860
(Someone is coming.)

1352
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:02,160
It's Jae Seok. What did he choose?

1353
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,560
(I hope he chose fried rice.)

1354
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,660
Did he already choose something?

1355
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,230
(I hope he chose jjamppong.)

1356
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,440
Fried rice...

1357
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,570
- Did you choose japchae rice? - Yes.

1358
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,440
(I chose japchae rice.)

1359
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:17,740
(Did you choose japchae rice?)

1360
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:20,050
(Disappointed)

1361
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:22,580
Why? You chose japchae rice too?

1362
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:25,980
- Why would you choose that? - Why would you choose japchae rice?

1363
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,890
I like it.

1364
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:29,950
Don't criticize my taste.

1365
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:33,260
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1366
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,490
As you said, I should have chosen the opposite of my decision.

1367
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,370
- Why did I... - You have to choose the opposite.

1368
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:42,500
We need two people to choose fried rice.

1369
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,470
It's not easy.

1370
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:47,340
I think Haha will choose fried rice.

1371
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:49,670
- Then he has to choose between us. - Yes.

1372
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,840
- I hope he'll choose me. - I'll be nice to him.

1373
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,050
In the car, I said I wanted to have fried rice.

1374
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:58,420
Someone might have heard...

1375
00:52:58,750 --> 00:52:59,920
and chosen...

1376
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:01,850
I don't know.

1377
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,590
Haha, please.

1378
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,690
- Haha would... - Please choose fried rice.

1379
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:08,390
Please.

1380
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:10,700
Let's say I choose fried rice, and no one chooses japchae rice.

1381
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,730
Then I'll get nothing.

1382
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,830
(What will he choose?)

1383
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:19,040
I chose this for Ji Hyo's sake

1384
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,070
Is it rice or noodles?

1385
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:22,370
- Why did you choose that? - I wanted soup.

1386
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:24,780
I'll slap your face if you chose japchae rice.

1387
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,150
(Please let it be fried rice.)

1388
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:28,850
No way.

1389
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:30,050
(We need fried rice.)

1390
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:31,780
- We need fried rice. - Why would you slap me?

1391
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:33,620
- Did you choose japchae rice? - What is it?

1392
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:35,190
It's japchae rice.

1393
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:41,930
(Why is he singing?)

1394
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:46,200
(For Jae Seok's other half, Haha brings fried rice.)

1395
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,230
Come here.

1396
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:49,700
(He's proud of Haha.)

1397
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:51,900
Were you about to slap me?

1398
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,810
(He remembers what Jae Seok said.)

1399
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,580
Seok Jin.

1400
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:59,350
- Happy Birthday to you - Wait, Haha.

1401
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:01,650
I'm going to eat

1402
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:04,950
I'm going to eat no matter what

1403
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,290
- He chose fried rice. - If there are three fried rice...

1404
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,130
(It's time for Kwang Soo to choose.)

1405
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:15,090
I should pick the other half of something others will choose.

1406
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:16,900
Okay.

1407
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:18,530
I choose fried rice.

1408
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:20,330
- Fried rice? - Yes.

1409
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:22,640
(He chooses fried rice.)

1410
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,570
- May I change it? - Go ahead.

1411
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:26,940
Jajangmyeon

1412
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:30,440
(He chooses jajangmyeon instead.)

1413
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,910
(Sighing)

1414
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:35,680
Please don't make me choose.

1415
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:37,580
(Kwang Soo struggles.)

1416
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,690
Here he comes.

1417
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:41,950
Which one is it?

1418
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:42,990
Which one is it?

1419
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,160
- Kwang Soo. - It's this side.

1420
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,190
(It's either jajangmyeon or jjamppong.)

1421
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:53,730
(Did you choose the other half of jjamppong?)

1422
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:56,370
(He brings jajangmyeon.)

1423
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:57,500
It's jajangmyeon.

1424
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,410
Goodness.

1425
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,240
He has no choice but to fight with Jong Kook.

1426
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,040
Gosh, this is tiring.

1427
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,180
I'm already tired.

1428
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,050
Can't I eat if someone brings...

1429
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:09,950
- jjamppong? - Jong Kook will choose jjamppong.

1430
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:11,850
It's difficult to eat.

1431
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,820
I don't think Jong Kook will choose jjamppong.

1432
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:17,320
Only one of you who chose jajangmyeon can eat.

1433
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,420
The others can't eat.

1434
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:19,630
- Really? - Yes.

1435
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:22,300
(It's Jong Kook's turn.)

1436
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,500
I'll choose between jajangmyeon or jjamppong.

1437
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,170
Please choose one.

1438
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:27,170
I choose...

1439
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:28,700
(Did he choose jjamppong?)

1440
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,470
Look at that.

1441
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:31,670
- Jong Kook. - Jong Kook.

1442
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,310
He chose jjamppong.

1443
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:34,540
(They've waited for jjamppong.)

1444
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:37,140
(My goodness.)

1445
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:41,010
(Jong Kook has always chosen jjamppong for 7 years.)

1446
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:44,820
(Did he choose jjamppong again?)

1447
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,320
(What about today?)

1448
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,160
I knew you'd choose jjamppong.

1449
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,120
We discussed a lot on the bus.

1450
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,290
That's why.

1451
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:54,230
I thought many of you chose jajangmyeon.

1452
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:55,730
- Jong Kook. - I chose jajangmyeon.

1453
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:58,600
- Jajangmyeon... - Let's see what So Min brings.

1454
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,100
This is annoying. There are four choices.

1455
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,400
(It's Se Chan's turn.)

1456
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,740
I bet Haha chose fried rice.

1457
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:08,440
Jae Seok chose japchae rice.

1458
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,540
(He narrows down his choice.)

1459
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:12,550
Kwang Soo probably chose jajangmyeon.

1460
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:15,920
(What will Se Chan choose?)

1461
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,880
Please go to the second floor.

1462
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,320
Here's Se Chan.

1463
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,320
Is he here?

1464
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,490
(Please choose fried rice.)

1465
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:23,460
It'd be incredible if he chose fried rice.

1466
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,490
This is the only choice I have.

1467
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:28,430
I'm sure of it.

1468
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,200
Wish me luck.

1469
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,360
(He should choose either fried rice or jjamppong.)

1470
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,700
- I'm sure of it. - Which side is it?

1471
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,700
Is it noodles or rice?

1472
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:36,840
Many of you chose rice.

1473
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,300
- Is it rice? - What is it?

1474
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:42,480
(Se Chan gets flustered after looking at the others.)

1475
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,280
(Did he choose either fried rice or jjamppong?)

1476
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,280
I hope he chooses jjamppong.

1477
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:49,350
(Did he choose either fried rice or jjamppong?)

1478
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:51,320
(What did you choose?)

1479
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,050
I have both rice and noodles.

1480
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:54,950
- What do you mean? - He chose japchae rice.

1481
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:56,490
Come here.

1482
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,820
(Se Chan chose...)

1483
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:58,830
It's japchae rice.

1484
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:02,430
(His choice is japchae rice with rice and noodles.)

1485
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:04,430
- Why did you choose japchae rice? - I didn't know.

1486
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:05,700
(He joins the others.)

1487
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,670
- Why did you choose that? - Have you lost your mind?

1488
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:10,940
Why did you choose it when you don't usually eat it?

1489
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,340
Why are you so tactless?

1490
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,170
- I was so sure of it. - How much time do we have?

1491
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:18,850
- I feel lonely. - I can't tell anymore.

1492
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:20,580
- It's random. - Gosh.

1493
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:22,380
Please choose jjamppong.

1494
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,120
It's perfect if he chooses jjamppong.

1495
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:30,560
Ji Hyo said she wanted jjamppong. Haha said he wanted fried rice.

1496
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,360
I'll choose...

1497
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:35,800
I'll choose what I want to eat.

1498
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,430
(She decides to make a choice independently.)

1499
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:39,900
- So Min. - She's here.

1500
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,070
- So Min. - What did you bring?

1501
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,800
It's perfect if she chooses jjamppong.

1502
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,940
That's right.

1503
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,170
(Then everyone can eat.)

1504
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:47,940
- Is it fried rice? - Is it rice or noodles?

1505
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,540
(If she chose fried rice, four members can eat.)

1506
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:57,920
(She must be chosen if she chose either jajangmyeon or japchae rice.)

1507
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,990
(She brings jajangmyeon.)

1508
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,060
What did you choose?

1509
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:04,990
It's the same situation for both.

1510
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:06,990
(Only those who are chosen get to eat.)

1511
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:08,530
- How is this possible? - Have a seat.

1512
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:13,170
(Only those who are chosen get to eat.)

1513
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:17,900
(It's also a mess at the other table.)

1514
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,870
All right.

1515
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:22,480
- It's unfortunate. - I don't have to think twice.

1516
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,140
- Jong Kook. - It's the same.

1517
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:27,210
What a terrible situation.

1518
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:29,350
Our situation is also annoying.

1519
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:33,290
Jong Kook chose jjamppong,

1520
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:36,420
- and Haha chose fried rice. - This is horrible.

1521
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,120
It depends on their choices. Choose only one.

1522
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,590
Does Haha get to choose?

1523
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:42,330
- The chosen ones can eat. - This is my second time playing.

1524
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:43,560
Please let me eat once.

1525
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,030
You're not allowed to eat yet.

1526
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,470
This is confusing for me.

1527
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:50,500
It's Jae Seok's birthday today. Se Chan started the show.

1528
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,440
I pity Seok Jin.

1529
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,340
(He explains why it's difficult to choose.)

1530
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:59,380
I don't know how to choose.

1531
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:02,080
Shall I pick someone by the length of the noodle?

1532
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,850
- That sounds good. - The length of a noodle.

1533
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:05,280
- Pick 1 noodle. - Pick 1.

1534
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,390
- Okay. - That's a good idea.

1535
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:11,120
The person who picks the longest noodle...

1536
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,430
will eat with Haha.

1537
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:16,600
Shouldn't you consider someone who has the most money?

1538
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:19,270
- Money? - In regards to money,

1539
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:21,630
I'll accept only a dollar for the participation fee.

1540
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:24,270
(He will take a dollar for participation.)

1541
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:25,310
What are you talking about?

1542
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:26,570
I won't consider money.

1543
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:28,210
- Won't you participate? - I'll pay the fee.

1544
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:29,910
- Okay. - Here you go.

1545
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,680
I'll only take participation fee.

1546
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,410
You have five seconds.

1547
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:35,720
- Four. - You won't eat?

1548
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,780
3, 2.

1549
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,750
2, 1.

1550
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:44,090
(They all pay up.)

1551
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:45,730
Three of you will participate.

1552
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:47,890
This is making me angry.

1553
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:49,530
Gosh, it's upsetting.

1554
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:51,700
- Thank you for the fee. - He became the king.

1555
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:54,300
You became the king for choosing fried rice.

1556
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:57,300
Congratulations. The three of you will participate.

1557
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,470
(He feels powerful.)

1558
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:59,540
Do we do it at once?

1559
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:00,840
- You should start. - I'll start.

1560
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,310
- Let's see. This is it. - Grab one.

1561
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:04,840
If it gets cut, you can't choose again.

1562
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,250
Of course.

1563
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:08,920
(He picks a noodle carefully.)

1564
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:09,920
Gosh.

1565
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,120
(It gets cut.)

1566
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:14,120
(His noodle gets cut.)

1567
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,120
It got cut.

1568
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,890
My noodle got tangled with the others.

1569
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:21,390
(It was too taut that it broke.)

1570
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,300
Yes.

1571
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,330
(Se Chan loses.)

1572
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:26,630
He lost his chance.

1573
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:28,230
I got it.

1574
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,740
- The noodle was quite long. - Poor Se Chan.

1575
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:32,340
It was quite long before.

1576
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,470
You should have been careful.

1577
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:35,070
We don't know yet.

1578
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:37,040
- Okay. - You grabbed one.

1579
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,410
(He expects to defeat Se Chan.)

1580
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,950
(Extending)

1581
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:43,780
You have to pull it out.

1582
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:47,120
(Will unlucky Seok Jin get lucky?)

1583
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,590
We don't know who will win yet.

1584
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:52,230
(The noodle extends.)

1585
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:56,900
(It suddenly gets cut.)

1586
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,170
(He might get lucky.)

1587
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:02,200
(Not today)

1588
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,940
- Hold it. - We don't know yet.

1589
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,470
(Jae Seok is ready to eat.)

1590
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:07,110
- Thank goodness. - The problem is...

1591
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:08,840
- Thank goodness. - It gets stuck.

1592
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,510
Yours will get cut too. It'll be the same.

1593
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:12,550
Hold it.

1594
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:14,480
It'd be amazing if I win.

1595
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,820
Gosh, I think mine is shorter.

1596
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:19,090
(We'll compare their noodles later.)

1597
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:21,220
I shouldn't get greedy.

1598
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:24,560
Any noodle that I can see will be longer than those.

1599
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:26,330
The noodles are tangled.

1600
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:27,460
I should be careful.

1601
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,830
He has to choose carefully.

1602
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:32,330
It's similar to the claw machine.

1603
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,800
- Is that it? - He picked one.

1604
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,300
- Goodness. - He got it.

1605
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:38,340
It's already longer than the others.

1606
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:39,340
(It looks long and stable.)

1607
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:41,770
He chose a good one.

1608
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:44,040
- He got it. - It's coming out.

1609
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,040
It's already long.

1610
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:49,480
(Will Jae Seok get to eat japchae rice?)

1611
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,750
- He got it. - Just pull it out.

1612
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:54,650
(It gets cut.)

1613
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:56,860
Okay!

1614
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,530
(As long as he pulls it out...)

1615
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:03,700
(However, it breaks.)

1616
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:05,630
Stay still.

1617
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:09,640
(I'm the one who will eat japchae rice.)

1618
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,640
This is...

1619
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,440
I grabbed it.

1620
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,310
Jae Seok is never the final winner.

1621
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:19,580
- He lost. - He grabbed it too hard.

1622
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,450
May I do it again?

1623
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:23,180
- This isn't fair. - You lost your chance.

1624
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:24,420
It was funny.

1625
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,250
- It wasn't funny. - It was very funny.

1626
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,520
I dropped it.

1627
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:29,320
Sit back down.

1628
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,690
(Jae Seok is eliminated.)

1629
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,790
- May I do it again? - Let's measure the noodles.

1630
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:34,830
(Seok Jin and Se Chan compare theirs.)

1631
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:36,430
Be accurate.

1632
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:37,830
Wait, mine is longer. Don't pull it.

1633
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:39,830
- I'm not. - It's the same.

1634
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:41,800
We should play again if it's the same.

1635
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,570
(He's shocked.)

1636
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:44,900
(I get to play again too.)

1637
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:46,370
- Do it one last time. - Look.

1638
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:47,810
- No. - Seok Jin.

1639
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:49,280
It's a little longer.

1640
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,740
- No. - What are you doing?

1641
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:52,850
You can't extend it.

1642
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:54,950
It was a close game.

1643
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:57,280
Pay two dollars to participate again.

1644
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,250
(Pay 2 dollars to participate again.)

1645
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,690
You may participate again.

1646
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:03,360
- Two dollars. - I'll poke you.

1647
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,990
- I'll poke you with this. - Seriously.

1648
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:06,060
Don't you want to eat?

1649
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:08,190
(Seok Jin wins the japchae rice in the end.)

1650
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:10,260
Let's compete with noodles.

1651
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:11,660
- Noodles are soggy. - Let's try.

1652
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:13,230
- Pick from your own dish. - Yes.

1653
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:15,000
Pick noodles from your own dish.

1654
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:17,800
Then one person will win by default.

1655
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:20,870
Please don't forget to pay the participation fee.

1656
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:26,080
(Please don't forget to pay the participation fee.)

1657
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,650
- How much is the participation fee? - Two dollars.

1658
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:29,420
Is it two dollars?

1659
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:32,320
- You should make it a dollar. - I only have a dollar.

1660
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:35,050
- I only have a dollar. - Do you only have a dollar?

1661
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:37,290
- Please bring down the price. - I will make it a dollar.

1662
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,560
It's a dollar for the first round.

1663
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,030
Who made these rules?

1664
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:41,690
They are ridiculous.

1665
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:44,930
Thick noodles aren't necessarily the best.

1666
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:47,300
(So Min is doing something strange.)

1667
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:48,570
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

1668
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:50,440
I am making my strand of noodle cold.

1669
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,770
She is unbelievable.

1670
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:55,040
So Min, I acknowledge your effort.

1671
01:03:55,810 --> 01:03:56,810
You are doing your best.

1672
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:58,710
(So Min uses the air conditioner to make the noodle taut.)

1673
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,480
Let's decide on the matches with rock, paper, and scissors.

1674
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:03,720
- Will someone win by default? - Of course.

1675
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,590
Flip hands to decide.

1676
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:06,950
Kwang Soo is putting his heart into this.

1677
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,120
Flip hands.

1678
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,620
(They decide to flip hands.)

1679
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:11,660
Get ready.

1680
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,260
Up or down? Flip your hands.

1681
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,330
(Kwang Soo wins by default by showing the back of his hand.)

1682
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:17,260
Okay!

1683
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:19,930
That makes Kwang Soo the first to go.

1684
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:22,000
(What?)

1685
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,140
What are you talking about? Why am I the first to go?

1686
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:25,370
- You are the first to go. - Don't be ridiculous.

1687
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,210
They should compete against each other.

1688
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:28,810
Both of them showed their palms.

1689
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:31,640
Seriously.

1690
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,150
- Rock, paper, scissors. - This is ridiculous.

1691
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:34,580
- Okay. - That means...

1692
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:38,250
you have been eliminated from the first game.

1693
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:40,020
(I guess you didn't know.)

1694
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:42,320
That's not how it works.

1695
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,360
You have been eliminated.

1696
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,190
- In one... - Hold the ends.

1697
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:48,560
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1698
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:50,100
So Min will win.

1699
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,560
She is cutting his noodle.

1700
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:58,340
(She attacks with the noodle she dried under the air conditioner.)

1701
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:02,680
(So Min's noodle breaks.)

1702
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:07,350
- Did you win? - I won.

1703
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:08,920
- All right. - Okay.

1704
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:11,920
That's right. Dry noodles break more easily.

1705
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:16,290
(He soaks the noodle in soup for the final round.)

1706
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,660
You can't use the same noodle. Pick a new strand.

1707
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:20,530
You should continue using the one you have used.

1708
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:23,730
Do you dislike me or something? What is your problem?

1709
01:05:23,730 --> 01:05:25,730
Do you hate the idea of me eating?

1710
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:26,870
You shouldn't change the noodle.

1711
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:28,270
- Are you jealous? - No, I am not.

1712
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,770
"Are you jealous?"

1713
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:33,740
Start.

1714
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:35,440
(Ji Hyo versus Kwang Soo)

1715
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:37,840
- Pull. In 1, 2, 3. - Pull, Kwang Soo.

1716
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,580
- Pull. - The one who pulls will lose.

1717
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,380
- Pull. - In 1, 2, 3.

1718
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:43,650
(They tell each other to pull, but refuse to move an inch.)

1719
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:44,880
Pull.

1720
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,890
- Neither one of them is pulling. - In 1, 2, 3.

1721
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:48,050
Kwang Soo, pull.

1722
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:50,160
Neither is pulling.

1723
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,090
- In 1, 2, 3. - Kwang Soo, pull.

1724
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:53,690
- Pull. - The one who pulls will lose.

1725
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:55,830
The one who pulls will lose.

1726
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:57,260
They won't pull.

1727
01:05:57,260 --> 01:06:03,800
(The brave Ji Hyo attacks first.)

1728
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:06,340
The one who pulls will lose.

1729
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:09,280
(They are worried that Ji Hyo's noodle will break.)

1730
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,840
Let's put them in the middle.

1731
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:13,480
(Kwang Soo's noodle is out.)

1732
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,050
- Yes! - Ji Hyo won.

1733
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,320
(Kwang Soo's noodle is out.)

1734
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,950
Let's put them in the middle.

1735
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:22,190
(Ji Hyo wins easily with a daring move.)

1736
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:25,020
- Ji Hyo won. - Did Kwang Soo lose?

1737
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:27,360
Ji Hyo won.

1738
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,830
(The sauce tastes especially good today.)

1739
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:36,440
(Spicy and chewy japchae rice and glossy fried rice)

1740
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:39,970
(Soft jajangmyeon and spicy jjamppong)

1741
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:44,010
(After the fierce matches, Ji Hyo, Jong Kook,)

1742
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:45,240
It's tasty.

1743
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:47,050
(Seok Jin, and Haha eat.)

1744
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,180
A spoonful of japchae rice is a dollar.

1745
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,420
- Really? - Shall we have a spoonful?

1746
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:51,680
Let's do that.

1747
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,520
Please give me a spoonful.

1748
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,120
- So Min will go first. - It's a dollar for a spoonful.

1749
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,660
- I will only take three people. - Me.

1750
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:58,960
- You have 3 people. - 3 people.

1751
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:00,330
(Se Chan tries a spoonful of japchae rice.)

1752
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:01,860
- Come on. - Lift it up.

1753
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:04,500
Isn't it hot?

1754
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,730
- Be careful. - That's nice.

1755
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:06,830
(He inhales a big spoonful of japchae rice.)

1756
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:10,100
(It's a big spoonful.)

1757
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,770
- You can't eat more. - It was on the spoon.

1758
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:14,010
You can't eat more.

1759
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:17,510
(She opens her mouth wide.)

1760
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:18,650
What are you doing?

1761
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:21,350
(She inhales the dish like a vacuum cleaner.)

1762
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:22,650
What are you doing?

1763
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:26,050
- It was on the spoon. - You can't eat more.

1764
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:30,190
(A japchae rice monster appears.)

1765
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:31,520
What a delinquent.

1766
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:33,590
- She ate all the japchae. - So Min.

1767
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:36,430
Three dollars...

1768
01:07:36,430 --> 01:07:38,160
- will clear the dish. - There are no noodles left.

1769
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:40,770
She will only leave rice behind.

1770
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:44,240
- I still haven't had a spoonful. - It's one spoonful.

1771
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,640
- It's 1 spoonful. - 1 spoonful.

1772
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:50,110
(It's Jae Seok's turn to have a spoonful of japchae rice.)

1773
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:53,580
Hey.

1774
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:56,750
- This is my spoon. - For goodness' sake.

1775
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:00,090
- This is my spoon. - He can use his own spoon.

1776
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:01,520
- Why are you upset? - Pile on food.

1777
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,660
I can't believe these delinquents.

1778
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:05,560
For goodness' sake.

1779
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:08,060
My nickname is "Ladle".

1780
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:12,500
(Inhaling)

1781
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:16,670
(A ladle monster appears.)

1782
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:18,440
That's good. Okay.

1783
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,710
For goodness' sake.

1784
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,240
- I can't believe these delinquents. - Okay.

1785
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:24,640
What is this?

1786
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:26,110
We gave you three dollars.

1787
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:27,810
I am really hungry.

1788
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:29,080
I can't eat this.

1789
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,680
Kwang Soo, you should borrow a dollar.

1790
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,720
- Won't you eat the rice? - Kwang Soo.

1791
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:34,790
If I lend you a dollar, can you pay back two dollars?

1792
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:37,360
(I will lend you some money.)

1793
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,690
Pay back two dollars later.

1794
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:40,390
(A loan with a high interest rate and japchae rice call for him.)

1795
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:43,530
This is your last chance to have a spoonful. Five.

1796
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:46,500
- Okay. - Pay back two dollars later.

1797
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,500
You are the witness. He needs to pay back two dollars.

1798
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:49,840
I will buy a spoonful.

1799
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,640
(Kwang Soo buys a spoonful of japchae rice.)

1800
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,470
- What is this? - They ate japchae.

1801
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:54,870
You inhaled the dish.

1802
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:57,540
(What do you want me to eat?)

1803
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:59,250
Haha, give me a spoonful.

1804
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:00,810
I will use a regular spoon.

1805
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:02,080
I will use a regular spoon.

1806
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,680
- I am serious. - I will lend you this for 50 cents.

1807
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,050
Can I have another 50 cents?

1808
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:09,320
(I want to borrow that ladle.)

1809
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:10,620
- What? - I will pay back three dollars.

1810
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:11,920
You will pay back three dollars?

1811
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,360
No, pay back 4 dollars. I will give you 2 dollars.

1812
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:15,900
I will give you two dollars.

1813
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,330
I don't have 50 cents.

1814
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,130
Then give me a dollar.

1815
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:21,300
Pay back four dollars, okay?

1816
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,840
- Okay. - He needs to pay back four dollars.

1817
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,070
Shall I get you a new ladle?

1818
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:27,210
No, it's okay.

1819
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:29,610
What is this? Did you borrow a ladle?

1820
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:31,180
I am not going to make this deal.

1821
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:34,650
(I am sorry.)

1822
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:39,350
I never agreed.

1823
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,320
Did I hear you wrong?

1824
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:43,760
(What is this ladle for?)

1825
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,160
From this moment on, this ladle is yours.

1826
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:46,660
(That's how it is.)

1827
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:47,890
Here you go.

1828
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,230
You need to pay back four dollars.

1829
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,130
That ladle is yours.

1830
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:54,200
I will use it to drink water.

1831
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:55,700
Kwang Soo.

1832
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,300
It has the faint smell of japchae rice.

1833
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:59,510
(The water tastes bitter.)

1834
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:01,210
Kwang Soo, the ladle is yours.

1835
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:02,810
I strongly recommend this japchae rice.

1836
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:04,140
- It's really tasty. - Let me have a taste.

1837
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:06,110
(SBS Prism Tower at Sangam-dong)

1838
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:08,280
I used up all of my money. I am broke.

1839
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:10,580
I spent everything at the restaurant.

1840
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:12,690
You need to pay back four dollars.

1841
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:13,890
- Four dollars. - Okay.

1842
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:15,560
Okay. I will give you real money.

1843
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:18,960
Okay. I will give you real money.

1844
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,660
No, I don't want that. Give me the game money.

1845
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:23,100
- I don't have any game money. - Come on.

1846
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:24,660
You promised me earlier.

1847
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:26,270
- I don't have any game money. - There are witnesses.

1848
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:28,940
What should I do? If he doesn't have any money,

1849
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:30,970
- can he pay me back next week? - I will give you real money.

1850
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:33,240
I don't want real money. I want game money.

1851
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,740
- I will give you five dollars. - I don't want it.

1852
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:37,540
If it's going to be real money, it's 50 dollars. No, 500 dollars.

1853
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:39,780
Why would it be 500 dollars? I don't have any money.

1854
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:41,410
Please tell me...

1855
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:44,150
I can receive the game money next week.

1856
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:45,620
I will give you real money.

1857
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:47,990
I don't want real money. How many times...

1858
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:49,660
do I have to tell you?

1859
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,290
I don't like this atmosphere.

1860
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:55,130
Stay here. You don't want to stay close to a fight.

1861
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,530
You will get caught up in it if you are next to So Min.

1862
01:10:57,530 --> 01:11:00,000
Then I wouldn't have lent you two dollars earlier.

1863
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,730
I will buy you a carton of cigarettes.

1864
01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:03,400
I don't want it. Shut it.

1865
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:04,870
(I don't smoke.)

1866
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:06,570
- You win if he buys you a carton. - That's right.

1867
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:08,780
A pack of cigarettes is expensive.

1868
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:11,540
(She fails to receive the money.)

1869
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:13,580
All right.

1870
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:16,980
- This is the final mission. - What is it?

1871
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:21,320
The sum of the money you have collected is 135 dollars.

1872
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:24,290
From the sum that is required to beat the staff,

1873
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:26,330
- you are 65 dollars short. - We only need a little bit more.

1874
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,900
The final mission, Money Talks, will provide a change...

1875
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:31,700
to change the fate of the team and individuals.

1876
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,000
(Money Talks)

1877
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,770
- Money Talks. - Money Talks.

1878
01:11:36,970 --> 01:11:38,100
It will be a team game.

1879
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:40,610
On the board are...

1880
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:43,540
different amounts of money from a dollar to 20 dollars.

1881
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:47,810
They are written behind the numbers at random.

1882
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:49,180
- I see. - Randomly?

1883
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,050
They are written at random.

1884
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:53,350
(Different amounts of money are behind the numbers.)

1885
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:57,390
Come up one by one, and pick a number.

1886
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:58,660
(The members come up one by one and pick a number.)

1887
01:11:58,930 --> 01:12:02,230
Listen as the amount of money goes up by a dollar per second,

1888
01:12:02,230 --> 01:12:04,200
and say, "Stop" at the desired amount.

1889
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:07,000
Then look at the amount you have picked.

1890
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,700
If the amount you stopped at equals to or is smaller than...

1891
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,710
the amount you picked, you get the money.

1892
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:15,610
If it's bigger, you lose the money.

1893
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:16,740
My goodness.

1894
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,610
(If the amount you stopped at is bigger, you lose the money.)

1895
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:22,120
(They must stop at the amount that is smaller.)

1896
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,550
- I'll have to try first. - This sounds difficult.

1897
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,420
How will I get it right?

1898
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:27,890
We just need to refrain from being greedy.

1899
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:31,020
Since each person gets a chance, you have eight chances in total.

1900
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:33,760
You succeed if you acquire 65 dollars.

1901
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:36,360
Then you get the prize money.

1902
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,300
If you acquire less, you fail.

1903
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:39,600
Then you don't get the prize money.

1904
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,870
(Running Man versus Staff)

1905
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:44,670
Decide on the order wisely.

1906
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:50,010
The unlucky ones should go first.

1907
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:51,940
You talk like you aren't one of them.

1908
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:52,980
(Haha, aren't you unlucky?)

1909
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:56,980
- He likes to rank the members. - You know,

1910
01:12:56,980 --> 01:12:59,520
you only seem lucky because you are among us.

1911
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,120
- He is unlucky from head to toe. - Stop it.

1912
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,660
Hey, go first.

1913
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:04,760
What are you talking about?

1914
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,590
(He is the unluckiest one.)

1915
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:09,830
- Why should I go first? - He is a throw-away card.

1916
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:11,200
No, I am not.

1917
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:13,070
You should go first.

1918
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:15,170
(Se Chan is the rookie of the unlucky ones, so he goes 1st.)

1919
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:16,670
- Should I go first? - Yes, go ahead.

1920
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,140
Let's go.

1921
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:20,840
(He must pick a number that has a high amount on it.)

1922
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:21,910
Which one do you pick?

1923
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:25,210
- I pick 8. - 8?

1924
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:26,510
(He picks number 8.)

1925
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:27,950
I'm going to think that's 15 dollars.

1926
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:30,620
- Stop at 14 dollars. - I'll do that.

1927
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:36,290
(He has to get as close as he can to the written amount.)

1928
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:37,420
Actually,

1929
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,530
there are eight of us.

1930
01:13:40,730 --> 01:13:42,660
Are you doing the calculations? I thought about that too.

1931
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:46,170
We need to earn nine dollars each.

1932
01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:47,930
If we all get it right, we'll earn 80 dollars.

1933
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:49,770
If 2 people get it wrong, we'll earn 60 dollars.

1934
01:13:49,870 --> 01:13:52,040
Can we get started?

1935
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,140
(When are you going to finish?)

1936
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:56,110
We already knew all that.

1937
01:13:56,110 --> 01:13:57,380
You have to analyze.

1938
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:58,910
But we already knew it.

1939
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:00,880
- Shouldn't we analyze? - You're taking too long.

1940
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,620
- We have to analyze. - Excuse me, Mr. Jee.

1941
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:04,080
Let's aim for 65 dollars.

1942
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,520
There's no point in getting 2 or 3 dollars.

1943
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,720
- Mr. Jee. - We can't stop there.

1944
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,720
I'm going to think this is 15 dollars,

1945
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:12,530
- so I'll stop at 14 dollars. - Let's go.

1946
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:13,960
- Let's go. - All right.

1947
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,100
- Pay close attention. - Don't be too greedy.

1948
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:17,700
I'll start counting.

1949
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,870
One dollar.

1950
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:21,270
(Remaining balance)

1951
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:22,340
Two dollars.

1952
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:24,270
Three dollars.

1953
01:14:24,870 --> 01:14:26,040
Four dollars.

1954
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,870
- Really? - Five dollars.

1955
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:28,880
(He was certain before, but now he feels pressured.)

1956
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,480
Six dollars.

1957
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:31,680
- This is tense. - Seven dollars.

1958
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,950
Shouldn't you stop him soon?

1959
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:35,010
- Eight dollars. - Just stop.

1960
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:36,320
- Nine dollars. - Stop.

1961
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,720
Good job.

1962
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:38,750
- 9 dollars? - 9 dollars.

1963
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:40,390
- Stop. - Good job.

1964
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:41,950
(Se Chan stopped at 9 dollars unlike what he said before.)

1965
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:44,690
Check the amount on the number, and if the amount you stopped at...

1966
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:47,690
is equal or less than that, you earn the money.

1967
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,330
You went too far though.

1968
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,000
- It's okay. - In 1, 2...

1969
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,870
(If the written amount is less than 9 dollars, he won't take the money.)

1970
01:14:53,870 --> 01:14:55,670
(This is their 1st attempt in accumulating 65 dollars.)

1971
01:14:55,670 --> 01:14:56,740
What is it?

1972
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:00,710
You did it.

1973
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:02,340
Good thing I stopped.

1974
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:04,210
See?

1975
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:05,750
- You did well. - Good thing I stopped.

1976
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:07,310
I was going to stop at 14 dollars.

1977
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:08,610
- Good thing you stopped me. - I know.

1978
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:10,350
Thanks for stopping me.

1979
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:12,120
- This is awesome. - You're only off by three dollars.

1980
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,750
I wanted to change my mind for some reason.

1981
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:15,660
- Good thing you stopped. - Good job.

1982
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:17,520
That was pretty good.

1983
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,590
(There is 56 dollars remaining. They have 7 more attempts left.)

1984
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:24,660
Let's go, Sang Soon.

1985
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:26,030
I don't look like him.

1986
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:27,030
(He must be the owner of "Kwang Soo's Bed and Breakfast".)

1987
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:28,570
- I look different. - You're Hyo Ri's husband.

1988
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:29,740
It's Sang Soon.

1989
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:33,540
The rest of you need to accumulate 56 more dollars.

1990
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:35,340
Let's go, Kwang Soo.

1991
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:37,480
I pick number 17.

1992
01:15:37,710 --> 01:15:38,710
- 17? - Yes.

1993
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:41,210
I don't like that number.

1994
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:42,720
What do you mean?

1995
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:45,720
I won't ask for more than three dollars.

1996
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,520
But we have to make 65 dollars.

1997
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:49,390
Get set, go.

1998
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:50,720
One dollar.

1999
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:52,560
Two dollars.

2000
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:55,430
- Three dollars. - Stop here.

2001
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:57,130
- Four dollars. - I think you should stop.

2002
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:59,030
- Five dollars. - Don't be greedy.

2003
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:01,100
- Six dollars. - This is too much for you.

2004
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:03,600
- Seven dollars. - We don't expect much from you.

2005
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,840
- Eight dollars. - Stop it.

2006
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,140
(He's hesitant.)

2007
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:09,440
- Nine dollars. - You already passed it.

2008
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,740
- 10 dollars. - Stop.

2009
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:12,150
10 dollars?

2010
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:15,720
It won't be higher than 4 dollars. I have a feeling.

2011
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,880
- I hope it's 10 dollars. - In 1, 2...

2012
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,050
(Nobody expects Kwang Soo to get 10 dollars.)

2013
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:20,990
(What's the amount on number 17?)

2014
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:24,420
(He gets 10 dollars.)

2015
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:27,030
(People looked down on me. Are you watching this?)

2016
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:28,630
Good thing you stopped.

2017
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:31,700
You should have kept going.

2018
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:36,100
You should have kept going. Why did you get scared?

2019
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:38,270
(I earned 10 dollars for you.)

2020
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:39,940
You should have stopped at 13 dollars.

2021
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:42,780
- What a coward. - Come on.

2022
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,310
- You should have kept going. - He's such a coward.

2023
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:47,550
He's usually unlucky, so he did pretty well.

2024
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:49,380
I earned 10 dollars, Jae Seok.

2025
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:53,420
There are 6 of you left. You need to accumulate 46 dollars.

2026
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:56,020
(There is 46 dollars remaining. They have 6 more attempts left.)

2027
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,760
- What number? - What number?

2028
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:58,760
(It's Seok Jin's turn with 46 dollars left to go.)

2029
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:00,590
- Number 20. - Number 20?

2030
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:02,960
- The last number. - You have chosen number 20.

2031
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,130
It's not a bad number.

2032
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:06,100
- 1 dollar. - I think it's around 5 dollars.

2033
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:07,400
Two dollars.

2034
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:09,240
- It's not a high number. - Right, he won't get a big amount.

2035
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,300
Three dollars.

2036
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:12,070
- Four dollars. - Stop it.

2037
01:17:12,070 --> 01:17:14,410
- Five dollars. - Stop.

2038
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:17,740
(Stop trying to act like you're bold.)

2039
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:19,650
- Six dollars. - Stop it.

2040
01:17:19,650 --> 01:17:20,710
He's about to pass it.

2041
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:21,980
- Seven dollars. - Stop.

2042
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:23,450
- He stopped at 7 dollars. - I stopped at 7 dollars.

2043
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:24,680
(He calls it at 7 dollars which is a safe amount.)

2044
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:25,690
- 7 dollars? - You stopped at 7 dollars.

2045
01:17:25,690 --> 01:17:27,490
Please let it be eight dollars.

2046
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:31,120
(Is the amount on number 20 less or greater than 7 dollars?)

2047
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,860
Why did you make me stop?

2048
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:36,160
(He earns the money.)

2049
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:37,900
- He got lucky. - I was going to stop later.

2050
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:40,000
- I feel bad. - He's incredible.

2051
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,200
- When did he stop? - I was being safe. I got seven.

2052
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:45,570
We're getting lucky. We picked all the good numbers.

2053
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:46,670
We did.

2054
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:49,340
(There is 39 dollars remaining. They have 5 more attempts left.)

2055
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:51,440
We picked all the high numbers.

2056
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:52,610
- The five of you... - They're all high numbers.

2057
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:54,110
accumulated 39 dollars.

2058
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:56,020
They're all above 10 dollars.

2059
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:57,580
So Min is next. What number?

2060
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:59,120
- Number 19. - Number 19? Okay.

2061
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,590
Come forward.

2062
01:18:00,590 --> 01:18:01,950
Get set, go.

2063
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:03,090
One dollar.

2064
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:04,790
Two dollars.

2065
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:06,490
Three dollars.

2066
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:08,960
- Four dollars. - No, no.

2067
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,460
- Five dollars. - She has to stop soon.

2068
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,400
- Six dollars. - Call it.

2069
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,800
Seven dollars.

2070
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:15,770
- 8 dollars. - There is 7 dollars left.

2071
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:17,070
Nine dollars.

2072
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:19,940
- 10 dollars. - You already passed it.

2073
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:21,540
- I think she passed it. - 11 dollars.

2074
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:23,040
- You passed it. - What are you doing?

2075
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,510
- 12 dollars. - You're done.

2076
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:27,880
- Why are you just standing there? - 13 dollars.

2077
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:31,580
- 13 dollars. - Stop.

2078
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,550
How much was that? 13 dollars?

2079
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:36,190
She stopped at 13 dollars. It's number 19.

2080
01:18:36,190 --> 01:18:37,260
- That's not possible. - Everybody was...

2081
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:39,160
- criticizing me. - In 1, 2...

2082
01:18:39,230 --> 01:18:40,560
- You stopped at 13 dollars. - She didn't get it.

2083
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:44,760
See?

2084
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,030
She fails.

2085
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,900
(Is there a hiding spot somewhere here?)

2086
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:51,770
- She wasn't even listening to us. - What was she thinking?

2087
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,970
She never listens to other people.

2088
01:18:54,210 --> 01:18:55,780
Keep going. Go to 13 dollars.

2089
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:57,280
- I'll go to 13 dollars. - 13 dollars.

2090
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,340
- Stop. - All right.

2091
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:59,480
Was it number 14?

2092
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:02,420
(Jae Seok stops at the same amount as So Min.)

2093
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:04,620
- Let's go. - Number 14. 13 dollars.

2094
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:08,790
(He earns 13 dollars.)

2095
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:10,120
All right.

2096
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,430
- Really? - See?

2097
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,830
- Number 11. - Number 11. Let's get started.

2098
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:17,130
Eight dollars.

2099
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,870
- Nine dollars. - Isn't it now?

2100
01:19:19,870 --> 01:19:21,170
- 10 dollars. - Stop.

2101
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:22,470
- 10 dollars. - Number 11.

2102
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:24,400
- Number 11. - It's here.

2103
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,040
We already got too many numbers above 10 dollars.

2104
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:28,570
- We got too many. - In 1, 2...

2105
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:29,680
(He earns 10 dollars.)

2106
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:31,810
- We're insane. - He should have kept going.

2107
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:34,980
We don't have anything less than 10 dollars except So Min.

2108
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:40,550
(There is 16 dollars remaining. They have 2 more attempts left.)

2109
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:42,790
I feel so pressured.

2110
01:19:42,790 --> 01:19:45,160
- But you have to keep going. - There's one in this column.

2111
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,260
(There are not many big amounts left.)

2112
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:48,230
- It's one of those. - I don't agree.

2113
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:49,930
Are you able to analyze this?

2114
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,230
We can still try.

2115
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:54,200
Just go. Let's get it.

2116
01:19:55,030 --> 01:19:56,670
Let's get it. Number 10.

2117
01:19:56,670 --> 01:19:58,870
- Try number 2. - Let's get it. Number 10.

2118
01:19:58,870 --> 01:20:01,810
Go against Jae Seok's suggestion.

2119
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:03,540
If you listen to him, you always get unlucky.

2120
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:05,750
He said number 10, so number 5 is half.

2121
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:08,480
- Number 20 was taken. - 5 is half of 10.

2122
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,950
- Okay, do that. - It was 2 times 7 before.

2123
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:13,050
Ready. Get set,

2124
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:14,620
- We picked too many high numbers. - go.

2125
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:15,620
One dollar.

2126
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:17,190
- Two dollars. - He doesn't get it.

2127
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:19,230
Three dollars.

2128
01:20:20,030 --> 01:20:21,060
Four dollars.

2129
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:22,630
Seven dollars.

2130
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:24,030
- Stop it. - Eight dollars.

2131
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:26,870
- Stop. - Good job.

2132
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:28,130
I think he could have gone up to 10 dollars.

2133
01:20:28,130 --> 01:20:29,540
He should have.

2134
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:32,970
(Haha aimed for half of what they needed.)

2135
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:35,040
(What's the amount on number 5?)

2136
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,110
In 1, 2, 3.

2137
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:42,050
That was close.

2138
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:44,350
- He failed. - That's right.

2139
01:20:44,450 --> 01:20:46,950
Let me do it again.

2140
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:49,120
"Let me do it again?"

2141
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,060
- Remember what I said? - "Let me do it again."

2142
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:53,560
I told you it's not right. You should have chosen number 10.

2143
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:56,330
It has to be over 16 dollars. For your reference,

2144
01:20:56,830 --> 01:21:01,000
there are 16, 19, or 20 dollars you can choose from.

2145
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,970
- There are only 3 left? - You have to choose 16 dollars.

2146
01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:04,600
Just call a number, Ji Hyo.

2147
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:06,210
Pick number two.

2148
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:08,110
We have nowhere else to go.

2149
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:09,580
Let's get it.

2150
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:10,980
(Number 1 sounds good.)

2151
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:13,210
- Do it. - He picks number one.

2152
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:14,280
- Do something else. - Let's get it.

2153
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:16,620
- Do this. - How does this sound, everybody?

2154
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:19,690
If you collect money amongst yourselves...

2155
01:21:19,690 --> 01:21:21,320
and give me 10 dollars,

2156
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:23,620
I'll get rid of 2 numbers that's under 10 dollars.

2157
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:29,030
(It's a chance to erase 2 numbers under 10 dollars.)

2158
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:30,500
- Okay. - Let's collect 10 dollars.

2159
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:33,230
- There is no reason not to do it. - Let's collect the money.

2160
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:35,100
I'll contribute two dollars.

2161
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:36,740
This is a bonus for you.

2162
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:38,640
- You won't lose anything. - We're fools if we don't do this.

2163
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:40,540
I'm giving you this chance.

2164
01:21:40,810 --> 01:21:44,240
- Check number 7 and 10. - Number 7?

2165
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,410
Let's see number seven.

2166
01:21:45,410 --> 01:21:46,650
(Number 7 and 10...)

2167
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:50,450
(are the numbers Jae Seok recommended many times.)

2168
01:21:50,450 --> 01:21:53,020
(What are their amounts?)

2169
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:58,120
(It's only 5 dollars.)

2170
01:21:58,660 --> 01:21:59,930
What was that?

2171
01:21:59,930 --> 01:22:01,590
(It's only 5 and 4 dollars.)

2172
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:04,360
- We predicted this. - These are the ones he recommended.

2173
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,300
- Let's get it. - Number 7 and 10.

2174
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:08,430
- You're incredible. - You're unbelievable.

2175
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:10,370
Why don't we do this?

2176
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,370
- We won't touch the one he picks. - I'll exclude the one you pick.

2177
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:14,570
You can have a look.

2178
01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:16,880
Don't choose number one. That's what he wanted you to choose.

2179
01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:18,980
He could have seen it.

2180
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:20,080
Aren't you supposed to whisper that to her?

2181
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,910
I'll cross out number one.

2182
01:22:22,450 --> 01:22:23,550
I'll cross it out.

2183
01:22:23,550 --> 01:22:24,580
(He crosses it out.)

2184
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:27,520
What's next? Did you say number two?

2185
01:22:28,150 --> 01:22:29,220
(Let's see.)

2186
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:31,420
- Go with your guts. - I think it's either of these.

2187
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:36,060
- Cross both out. - Are you a fortuneteller or what?

2188
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,330
Are you a fortuneteller?

2189
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:41,070
- What do you do? - I'm speechless.

2190
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:43,170
- Pick the next one. - You cross out everything I say?

2191
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:44,740
You looked so cool.

2192
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:46,710
- This is... - That was cool.

2193
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:48,840
- You cross out everything I say? - This is a skill.

2194
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:51,980
I think it's number one. Let's get it.

2195
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:54,150
(Jae Seok consistently suggests number one.)

2196
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:56,680
- It can't be. It's either 2 or 3. - Number 2 or 3.

2197
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:59,250
- He kept on picking number one. - I'm confused.

2198
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,890
- It can't be. - Let's get number one.

2199
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:06,130
It's Jae Seok's birthday today, so I'll go with number one.

2200
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:07,360
Number one?

2201
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,430
Let's get started.

2202
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:10,660
(Ji Hyo decides to trust Jae Seok's birthday luck.)

2203
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:12,830
We'll just stop at 16 dollars. Can we just rip it?

2204
01:23:12,830 --> 01:23:15,940
13 dollars. 14 dollars.

2205
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:17,400
15 dollars. 16 dollars.

2206
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,670
- Stop. - All right.

2207
01:23:18,670 --> 01:23:19,670
Number one.

2208
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:21,340
One...

2209
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:23,140
(Ji Hyo trusted Jae Seok and picked number 1.)

2210
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:26,110
- 2... - We need 16 dollars.

2211
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:28,580
- Please. - We need 16 dollars or more.

2212
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:31,620
(If number 1 is more than 16 dollars,)

2213
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:35,490
(they get to go to Salar de Uyuni that Se Chan recommended.)

2214
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:38,490
(If it's less than 16 dollars,)

2215
01:23:38,490 --> 01:23:41,660
(they'll ride New Zealand's Nevis Swing recommended by staff.)

2216
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:45,260
(Is number 1 above 16 dollars?)

2217
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:46,470
It starts with one.

2218
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:47,870
- No. - It's one.

2219
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:51,700
Mission failed.

2220
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:53,210
(They fail the mission.)

2221
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:55,980
Mission failed.

2222
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:57,080
Goodness.

2223
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,810
Can I see what number 12 is?

2224
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:00,410
Yes. You can look.

2225
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:02,720
We should have picked number 12.

2226
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:05,390
Why did we change our minds? It's because of Jae Seok.

2227
01:24:05,390 --> 01:24:06,990
- Number two. - That was it.

2228
01:24:06,990 --> 01:24:08,960
See? That's the one you picked.

2229
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,260
- You kept on picking it. - He kept on saying, "Let's get it."

2230
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:12,930
That's why we didn't pick it.

2231
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:14,690
He kept on saying, "Let's get it."

2232
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:17,030
- We didn't feel safe about it. - You kept on picking it.

2233
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:19,570
Jong Kook and I kept recommending number two.

2234
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:21,570
Number two?

2235
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:23,570
- There were two good ones. - That's right.

2236
01:24:24,170 --> 01:24:28,140
You lost today,

2237
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:31,480
so please put New Zealand's Nevis Swing...

2238
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:34,050
on the board.

2239
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,720
I hate this.

2240
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:37,680
(Nevis Swing is the 1st potential place out of 4.)

2241
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:42,090
And how much do you have right now, Haha?

2242
01:24:42,090 --> 01:24:43,220
I have 34 dollars.

2243
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:45,490
Each name can be bought at 10 dollars.

2244
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:47,360
Which names would you like to buy?

2245
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:49,700
There are only two of mine, right?

2246
01:24:49,930 --> 01:24:51,430
Wait. Who wants to volunteer?

2247
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,070
Hold on.

2248
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:56,670
Remember during the I Go Race,

2249
01:24:56,770 --> 01:24:58,500
- you survived. - He did.

2250
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,870
- When was that? - During the I Go Race.

2251
01:24:59,870 --> 01:25:00,870
When was I excluded?

2252
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:02,780
- You were. - He wasn't even given the penalty.

2253
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:04,780
I was a little hurt over that.

2254
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:08,280
I'll buy one of Seok Jin's.

2255
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:09,620
Why? Why would you buy mine?

2256
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:11,720
Because during the I Go Race...

2257
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,450
- What about it? - Come on.

2258
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:15,920
- Good. - Can you bring the board back?

2259
01:25:16,190 --> 01:25:17,990
Please bring it back. I'll buy...

2260
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:21,590
two names of the person who chooses the lowest number.

2261
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:24,330
(He'll buy two name tags of the person who chooses the lowest.)

2262
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,700
- Two? - That's a lot.

2263
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,330
The lowest amount?

2264
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:30,070
That person?

2265
01:25:30,270 --> 01:25:31,470
The person who picks the lowest?

2266
01:25:31,470 --> 01:25:32,670
I'll go.

2267
01:25:32,970 --> 01:25:33,970
It's eight dollars.

2268
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:35,440
(Jong Kook picks 8 dollars.)

2269
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,880
That's high.

2270
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,610
Go ahead, So Min.

2271
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:45,990
Two dollars?

2272
01:25:46,190 --> 01:25:47,290
Really?

2273
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:48,320
(She picks 2 dollars.)

2274
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,690
- Do we have to keep going? - Is it necessary?

2275
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:53,230
Pick whatever.

2276
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:54,860
- My gosh. - If somebody picks...

2277
01:25:54,860 --> 01:25:57,160
If somebody picks one dollar, that's too bad for them.

2278
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:58,460
That's not possible.

2279
01:25:58,460 --> 01:26:00,300
- Somebody might pick one dollar. - That's not possible.

2280
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:01,670
Are you going to get this?

2281
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:03,200
Let's get number seven?

2282
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,040
- Please let it be one dollar. - He loves that number.

2283
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,470
- No way. - Let's get it.

2284
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:08,270
It's one dollar.

2285
01:26:08,270 --> 01:26:10,040
Let's get...

2286
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,310
(Let's get one dollar.)

2287
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:15,580
(That's unbelievable.)

2288
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:19,490
(They are both shocked and delighted.)

2289
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:24,860
(They didn't think Jae Seok would actually pick it.)

2290
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:27,390
Let me do it again.

2291
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:29,500
(Jae Seok does the impossible again.)

2292
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:30,730
Really?

2293
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:32,630
This is impossible.

2294
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:35,570
How did you do that?

2295
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:37,470
Please give him a round of applause.

2296
01:26:37,470 --> 01:26:41,570
(Happy birthday, Jae Seok.)

2297
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:44,140
(They're happy, cheerful, and delighted.)

2298
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:45,880
- Happy birthday - I got goosebumps.

2299
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:48,480
- Dear Jae Seok - People will think we made it up.

2300
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,280
- No way. - People might think that.

2301
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:53,690
- That's not possible. - Your problem is "Let's get it."

2302
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:56,420
It's your birthday too. Today must be your day.

2303
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:58,290
- This is such a weird feeling. - I just got chills.

2304
01:26:58,290 --> 01:26:59,760
- That was shocking. - I got goosebumps.

2305
01:27:00,490 --> 01:27:02,560
That's so cruel.

2306
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:05,570
Whose names shall I cover?

2307
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:07,400
Wait, Haha.

2308
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,200
Remember the beginning?

2309
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:10,970
Se Chan and I...

2310
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:12,670
We were always so close to winning.

2311
01:27:12,670 --> 01:27:13,770
- Remember what we talked about? - What is it?

2312
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:14,970
We said we won't pick each other.

2313
01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:15,980
- Haha. - Hey.

2314
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:17,580
- That's different. - He picked somebody else.

2315
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:18,980
- Haha. - Can you cover one of mine?

2316
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:20,080
(He's miserable.)

2317
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,350
Remember the sophora root tea?

2318
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:23,350
Why would he do that?

2319
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:24,950
- You have no sense of shame. - That's what I'm saying.

2320
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:26,150
Stop it.

2321
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:27,820
He's so shameless.

2322
01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:30,460
Just say, "Let's get it."

2323
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:31,920
- Should I cover yours? - Please cover one of mine.

2324
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,430
- What should I do? - Please.

2325
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:34,430
I feel so bad.

2326
01:27:34,430 --> 01:27:35,960
Pick the person who gets the highest number.

2327
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:37,830
- Let's do that. - Okay.

2328
01:27:37,830 --> 01:27:39,870
I'll go with the highest number. Okay.

2329
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:42,440
It's over if somebody gets 20 dollars.

2330
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:43,470
It'll be over.

2331
01:27:43,570 --> 01:27:45,170
We've been filming for too long.

2332
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:47,270
- It's 12 dollars. That's high. - She got 12 dollars.

2333
01:27:47,310 --> 01:27:48,640
- Who was that? - Me.

2334
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:51,210
- He might get 20 dollars. - Okay.

2335
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:52,610
Keep going.

2336
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:54,310
- 14 dollars. - That's the highest.

2337
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:56,380
Okay. I got 14 dollars.

2338
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:59,790
- Se Chan. - Okay.

2339
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:02,990
18 dollars.

2340
01:28:03,490 --> 01:28:05,290
What was that? What did you do?

2341
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:07,730
- That was unexpected. - I'm set.

2342
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:10,400
20 dollars.

2343
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,130
I'm set.

2344
01:28:12,130 --> 01:28:13,870
- What did you say? - "20 dollars".

2345
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:15,640
"20 dollars".

2346
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:17,300
I was pretty high.

2347
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:18,570
(I'll show you all.)

2348
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:21,370
Nine dollars.

2349
01:28:21,370 --> 01:28:24,380
(Ji Hyo and Jae Seok are left.)

2350
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:27,250
- Go, Ji Hyo. - Me?

2351
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,250
I think she'll get 20 dollars.

2352
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:31,450
Kwang Soo might lose with 18 dollars.

2353
01:28:31,450 --> 01:28:33,690
Jae Seok is hopeful. What would Ji Hyo pick?

2354
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:35,460
Me?

2355
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:39,390
(She hits the jackpot with 20 dollars.)

2356
01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:42,930
(Ji Hyo picks the highest amount possible.)

2357
01:28:42,930 --> 01:28:46,070
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo are both dejected.)

2358
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:51,770
(It's Ji Hyo at the end.)

2359
01:28:51,770 --> 01:28:53,710
This is awesome. She's incredible.

2360
01:28:54,170 --> 01:28:55,170
Really?

2361
01:28:55,170 --> 01:28:56,480
(I thought today was my day.)

2362
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,540
- Today's not his day. - He didn't even pick.

2363
01:28:58,850 --> 01:29:00,710
Kwang Soo was so close to winning.

2364
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:02,850
(I wanted to be lucky today.)

2365
01:29:02,850 --> 01:29:03,850
(There were no surprises.)

2366
01:29:03,850 --> 01:29:06,250
So I'll cover Ji Hyo's name.

2367
01:29:06,490 --> 01:29:07,790
Okay.

2368
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:10,120
Why do I feel like Seok Jin will be picked?

2369
01:29:10,990 --> 01:29:13,130
Why does it look like there are so many of mine?

2370
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:15,400
There are four of mine, but it looks like Seok Jin has more.

2371
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,600
- Why does it look that way? - This is weird.

2372
01:29:18,530 --> 01:29:20,670
(Whose name will be picked from this roulette?)

2373
01:29:20,670 --> 01:29:23,440
I'll let Jae Seok spin this...

2374
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:26,370
because it's his birthday today.

2375
01:29:26,370 --> 01:29:28,310
What if you spin it, and it lands on your name?

2376
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:30,440
It's be hilarious if he picks his own name.

2377
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:32,050
- Let's get it. - Let's get it.

2378
01:29:32,050 --> 01:29:35,150
- Let's get it. - Let's get it.

2379
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:39,190
Pick your own name. The spirits will help you.

2380
01:29:39,190 --> 01:29:40,320
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin have the highest possibilities.)

2381
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:44,190
(The person who gets picked will be going on the Nevis Swing.)

2382
01:29:45,190 --> 01:29:46,260
Please.

2383
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:47,960
Please save me.

2384
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:51,360
- I have such bad luck today. - There are so many of mine.

2385
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,370
There are so many.

2386
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:53,700
We're almost there.

2387
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:54,870
It's me.

2388
01:29:54,870 --> 01:29:55,970
- No. - It's Kwang Soo.

2389
01:29:55,970 --> 01:29:57,840
No way.

2390
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,840
(Please)

2391
01:30:02,810 --> 01:30:05,710
(No way.)

2392
01:30:05,710 --> 01:30:08,210
(Who's the first person to go on Half and Half Tour?)

2393
01:30:13,090 --> 01:30:15,720
(Jae Seok, let's get it.)

2394
01:30:16,990 --> 01:30:17,990
No way.

2395
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:20,560
(That's unbelievable.)

2396
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:24,560
(Is this for real?)

2397
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:30,670
(This must be a drama.)

2398
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:32,670
(Everyone other than the birthday boy is happy.)

2399
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:34,070
Let's get it.

2400
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:35,880
- Let's get it. - Let's get it.

2401
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:36,880
Let's get it.

2402
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,980
- Good job. - Happy birthday

2403
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:40,880
(He'll remember his 45th birthday.)

2404
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:44,680
(When did things start going bad?)

2405
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:47,490
This is one of your unluckiest days.

2406
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:50,690
(When he called even,)

2407
01:30:50,690 --> 01:30:52,660
(it was odd.)

2408
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:54,760
(It's odd.)

2409
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:57,700
(Jae Seok always guessed wrong.)

2410
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:59,430
(Please don't do anything.)

2411
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:00,670
(Just go home.)

2412
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:04,200
(He was given all sorts of criticism,)

2413
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:09,180
(but he hoped for a birthday miracle.)

2414
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:14,480
Please put "Plus one" next to Jae Seok's name.

2415
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:16,980
This is interesting. I'm amazed.

2416
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:18,580
- This is unbelievable. - I understand how you must feel.

2417
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:19,850
I can't go there.

2418
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:23,220
How did that happen? I thought it was me.

2419
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,560
Jae Seok.

2421
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:28,930

(and excluded.)

(It's a story of wits.)

2428

(They have 7 years of experience dealing with Seok Jin.)

2429
