1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,179
(2017 Running Man's 3rd Global Project)

2
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:12,550
(Half and Half Tour)

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,019
(Salar de Uyuni is nature's biggest and clearest mirror.)

4
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:19,059
(Bora Bora is Venus' island located in the South Pacific Ocean.)

5
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:21,789
(Rome is the eternal city that has the history of the Roman Empire.)

6
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,260
(Antelope Canyon is a sandstone formation created by rain and wind.)

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,899
(Alaska is the home of extreme sports and aurora.)

8
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:29,870
(Lake Hillier is a romantic lake that is made pink by plankton.)

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,070
(Bow River lets the visitors enjoy fly fishing in the Rocky Mountains.)

10
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,909
(Krabi is a fantastic vacation spot where the sky and sea connect.)

11
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:36,909
(So Min's recommendation)

12
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:40,479
(Did you think there'd be only paradise ahead of you?)

13
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,380
(There are also hideous vacation places which the staff recommended.)

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,189
(8 recommendations from the members and 8 recommendations from the crew)

15
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:52,520
(Each week, the members have a match to put their names on the roulette.)

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,060
(First destination turned out to be the Nevis Swing in New Zealand.)

17
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,070
(Jae Seok, the icon of penalties, got Nevis Swing in New Zealand.)

18
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,700
(Second destination was...)

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,069
(Bora Bora, the fantastic vacation spot, which Haha recommended.)

20
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:09,810
(So Min, the icon of luck, got Bora Bora.)

21
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:13,609
(Today, which travel destination and member will be chosen?)

22
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,450
(Fall is around the corner at a house wedding hall in Seoul.)

23
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,780
- Hello. - Hello.

24
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,049
- Hello. - Hello.

25
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:21,920
I haven't seen heart decorations in a while.

26
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,459
(There are pink hearts with the members' names.)

27
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:30,799
The broken hearts make me worried.

28
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,730
Where are the broken hearts?

29
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:34,799
(What are the 2 ominous broken hearts?)

30
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,900
Where are the broken hearts?

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,540
I think they are meant for men.

32
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,769
Kwang Soo, go over there.

33
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,040
What are you talking about?

34
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:45,540
- You should go over there, too. - Go over there.

35
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,109
Jae Seok and you should go.

36
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,480
Today, we are having Half and Half Project Part Three.

37
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,950
As you have guessed, it will be a Couple Race.

38
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,890
(Half and Half Project Part 2: Couple Race with hearts)

39
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,290
(The single men are excited.)

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,090
The weather is perfect for a Couple Race.

41
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,159
Today, the couples will be decided right after the women enter.

42
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,230
- Really? - Right after?

43
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,829
Including Ji Hyo and So Min,

44
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:10,439
eight women will enter in order.

45
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,740
There will be a lot of women.

46
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,069
I can't believe there will be eight.

47
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,009
(They are ready to captivate men's hearts.)

48
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,210
(The 8 women are waiting to make a grand entrance.)

49
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,020
The two women without male partners...

50
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,719
will take the broken hearts.

51
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,219
Those are for women.

52
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,060
We will have a partner no matter what.

53
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,490
It's 100 percent.

54
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,330
However, there is a special rule in deciding the couples.

55
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,800
(There is a special rule.)

56
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,469
If the man a woman chose already has a partner,

57
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,840
she can shout, "Come out" to her for a chance to be his new partner.

58
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,340
- My goodness. - Really?

59
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,710
Then the man will decide...

60
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,539
after the two women have a simple match.

61
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,349
The woman who loses a partner that way...

62
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,020
moves one space to the right.

63
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,819
If the man on the right has a partner,

64
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:03,319
she will be forced to move one space to the right.

65
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:05,819
Wait a minute. I am sorry,

66
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,659
but does that mean I am the worst choice?

67
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:09,759
Don't be ridiculous.

68
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,930
I will tell you what the order means.

69
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,099
We conducted a popularity vote with the female guests.

70
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:16,300
All right. Say no more. Say no more.

71
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,370
- Wait a minute. - Don't speak.

72
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,539
Which side is the most popular?

73
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,370
This is the result of a popularity vote.

74
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,340
- Jae Seok got four votes. - Really?

75
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,210
Jong Kook and Haha got one vote each.

76
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,539
- My goodness. - I am relieved.

77
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,050
The rest got zero votes.

78
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,409
(2 people refused to vote.)

79
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,550
Did I get zero votes?

80
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,590
Then why am I standing here? Is it the alphabetical order?

81
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,590
Who do they think they are?

82
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:38,189
- Seriously. - Let's see who they are.

83
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,889
They are so mean.

84
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,289
The female guests will enter now.

85
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:44,830
Please come on out.

86
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,969
We need to get the ones who move to the right.

87
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:49,900
(Here they come.)

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
(Who is the star of this stylist and groovy music?)

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,669
It's a hip hop song.

90
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,370
(Who is the star of this stylist and groovy music?)

91
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,909
(Her silhouette is stylish.)

92
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:02,009
My goodness.

93
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:06,020
(Here I come, Running Man.)

94
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:13,889
(With whom are the members impressed?)

95
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,899
(The actress with perfect looks, Lee Elijah)

96
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:25,800
(She can play a shy girlfriend and a resentful and wicked woman.)

97
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,439
(She walks with confidence and turns like a model.)

98
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,209
You look great.

99
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:33,680
(She twists her ankle.)

100
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,319
(What was that?)

101
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,120
(The elegant woman shows an unexpected charm.)

102
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,449
What was that?

103
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,019
My goodness.

104
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,360
That's good.

105
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,589
My goodness.

106
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:49,290
Elijah, that was great.

107
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,529
- That was great. - It was funny.

108
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,230
- That was great. - I loved it.

109
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,069
- Is your ankle okay? - It's okay.

110
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,040
Please say hello to the viewers.

111
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,209
Hello, I am Lee Elijah, an actress.

112
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:01,769
Elijah.

113
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,180
Is that your real name?

114
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,310
Yes, it is.

115
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,009
Are you from abroad?

116
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:08,180
No, I am not.

117
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,750
She is from Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province.

118
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,220
- Elijah. - Are you from Changwon?

119
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,060
- I am from Changwon, too. - Really?

120
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,060
- I have lived in Changwon. - You have lived in Changwon.

121
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,389
It's nice to meet you.

122
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:21,730
(He suddenly speaks in a dialect.)

123
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,730
We are like a family.

124
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,399
You are terrible at speaking in a dialect.

125
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,399
This is the best.

126
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,370
- Elijah. - Yes?

127
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,970
In the past, you have talked about...

128
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,209
- your ideal type. - Really?

129
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,110
She talks about it in a wishy-washy way.

130
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,680
"Someone I can talk to all night long under the stars."

131
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,980
"Star" is the meaning of my wife's name.

132
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,149
(Changwon and the stars make us one.)

133
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:46,420
My goodness.

134
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,750
You are right.

135
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,750
What is wrong with him?

136
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,589
"Star" is the meaning...

137
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:52,720
Stop it!

138
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,959
(They speak in a strange dialect.)

139
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,730
Stop it!

140
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,360
You are so bad at it.

141
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,100
Stop it. You have done enough.

142
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,529
- Stop it. - Stop it.

143
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,339
- Stop it. You have done enough. - You are so bad at it.

144
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,540
- Elijah. - Yes?

145
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,439
- Your ideal type remains the same. - Yes.

146
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,509
You want someone you can talk to all night long under the stars.

147
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,910
- Yes, communication is important. - Have you...

148
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,649
recently talked to anyone under the stars?

149
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:18,920
Have you recently talked to anyone under the stars?

150
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,949
I have talked to myself.

151
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:25,290
(I have talked to myself.)

152
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,490
- She has her walls up. - I am impressed.

153
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,490
- Her agency readied her thoroughly. - That's not it.

154
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,329
She is old-fashioned.

155
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:32,560
She and I are in the same agency.

156
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,600
- Really? - It's King Kong Entertainment.

157
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,300
- I am impressed. - I knew it.

158
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,769
The agency takes good care of its artists.

159
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:42,310
Kwang Soo, you have recently talked to someone under the stars, right?

160
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,279
(Let me ask you this.)

161
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,379
What?

162
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:48,550
Why are you spouting nonsense?

163
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:51,519
What is wrong with him?

164
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,220
- Calm down. - What is wrong with him?

165
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,350
It's just a question.

166
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:58,220
Who will Elijah choose?

167
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,860
Elijah, go.

168
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,060
- What should I do? - Stand next to the one you like.

169
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,959
- That's it. - Seok Jin.

170
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,160
What is going on?

171
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:12,269
(Is Seok Jin the one Elijah wants to talk to under the stars?)

172
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,939
Where are you going? Hey. Hey!

173
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:16,209
(Where are you going, Elijah?)

174
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:17,639
(Running)

175
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,709
She made me look like a fool.

176
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:21,879
Elijah!

177
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:22,980
(Elijah chooses Jae Seok.)

178
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,649
Elijah, I am disappointed.

179
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,149
- I am sorry. - It's just as we had expected.

180
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:29,889
Elijah and I are a couple.

181
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:31,290
(They are a temporary couple.)

182
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,019
You will be here later.

183
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,589
You will be here later.

184
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:36,529
I won't choose you even if you do.

185
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:37,699
It's bound to happen.

186
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,529
- It's bound to happen. - You will go that far.

187
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,170
Let's see the next guest.

188
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,730
- Come on in. - Who is the next female guest?

189
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,740
(Who is the next female guest?)

190
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:50,379
(Her outfit is bright, and her hair is long and straight.)

191
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:52,680
You chose first.

192
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:55,810
- "Gashina". - "Gashina".

193
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,050
It's Sun Mi's song. It's Sun Mi!

194
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,550
"Gashina".

195
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,720
(The real Sun Mi appears.)

196
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,120
It's Sun Mi!

197
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,230
(Unbelievable)

198
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,800
(Sun Mi finally visits the show.)

199
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,199
(The sexy queen who makes the heart beat, Sun Mi)

200
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,839
(She is a sexy fighter who has 10 years of experience.)

201
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,670
(Her new song, "Gashina," is top 1 on various music charts.)

202
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,310
Let's go. Let's go.

203
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,180
- Come on. - Hello.

204
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,850
As soon as you made a comeback, your new song, "Gashina,"

205
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,190
- became the talk of the town. - I love the song.

206
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,519
It's a great song.

207
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,789
- The music video is a work of art. - It's artistic.

208
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,090
(She is incredible.)

209
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:41,529
- The music video is a work of art. - It's artistic.

210
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:43,659
(Do you mean something like this?)

211
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,029
I watched it before I went to bed last night.

212
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:48,330
I watched it 20 times yesterday.

213
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,899
- What? - Really?

214
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:53,840
(Sun Mi's Gun Dance in "Gashina" is fatally beautiful.)

215
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,039
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

216
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,610
- You have watched the dance often. - I know it by heart.

217
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,110
- I have watched it often. - Please show us the dance.

218
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,240
- I have watched it very often. - Music, please.

219
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,149
- I watched it last night, too. - Kwang Soo.

220
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,350
Incorrect. Incorrect.

221
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,149
(He looks like he is having a nervous breakdown.)

222
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:10,190
- It's one of her dance moves. - It's a different dance.

223
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,120
Next is Haha.

224
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,460
(Next is Haha, the singer.)

225
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,460
You are like Song Min Ho.

226
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,730
(He recreates the Gun Dance nicely.)

227
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,360
Jong Kook, let's go.

228
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:21,029
Really?

229
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:22,600
(Time out.)

230
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,440
Jong Kook hasn't watched the music video.

231
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,039
(He ruins the atmosphere.)

232
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,509
- What is wrong with him? - Well,

233
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:30,440
- that's the reality. - He ruined the atmosphere.

234
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:32,740
Sun Mi.

235
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,610
"Gashina" is incredibly popular these days.

236
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,080
- Seriously. - The staff can show us the dance.

237
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,450
The entire nation is under the spell of "Gashina".

238
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,950
Any staff member can dance to "Gashina". Play the song.

239
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,990
Kwon Ryeol, come on out.

240
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:45,690
- Kwon Ryeol. - Anyone can dance to the song.

241
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,690
Anyone can dance to the song.

242
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,100
- Kwon Ryeol. - Who knows the dance?

243
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,370
- You know the dance. Come on. - Everyone does.

244
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,129
(Bang, bang)

245
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,039
(Kwon Ryeol shoots.)

246
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,809
(He dances in a sexy way.)

247
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,480
(Embarrassed)

248
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,480
The popularity of "Gashina"...

249
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,809
made Kwon Ryeol dance like this.

250
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,720
What is wrong with him?

251
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,590
(Sun Mi is the best.)

252
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:17,960
Sun Mi, it's time to make your choice.

253
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,820
- Sun Mi, go. - Go.

254
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,129
That's it.

255
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:22,830
Sun Mi, look this way.

256
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,129
This is the dance.

257
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:26,700
(Is she aiming for Seok Jin?)

258
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:29,299
(Shooting)

259
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:32,240
(Maybe next time.)

260
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,840
(She approaches Kwang Soo this time.)

261
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,470
Kwang Soo, she is behind you.

262
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,909
- Kwang Soo. - She's behind you.

263
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,179
Are you leaving?

264
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:41,679
(Is she leaving or not?)

265
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,090
(She leaves.)

266
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,190
Will she choose Jae Seok again?

267
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,789
(Jae Seok is popular today.)

268
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:52,460
My goodness.

269
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,659
Wait a minute.

270
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:57,230
It's no fun over here.

271
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,860
I didn't know Sun Mi would come to me.

272
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:02,029
What do I need to do?

273
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:03,639
You need to choose one of them.

274
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,269
- Really? - Yes.

275
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,909
I have to choose one of them.

276
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:08,970
(Should I choose Sun Mi or Elijah?)

277
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,580
(That is the question.)

278
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,110
All right then. Elijah, please come this way.

279
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,950
Had she chosen Seok Jin...

280
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,980
(Jong Kook and Elijah become a couple.)

281
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,649
Had she chosen Seok Jin or Kwang Soo...

282
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:21,950
- Elijah. - Yes?

283
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:25,389
Don't take it personally. You can play games with him today.

284
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:27,129
- What? - I know. He's strong.

285
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:29,990
- Of course. - I have a say in this matter.

286
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,960
- Jong Kook is already upset. - Why?

287
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,169
- He's already mad. - It's not that.

288
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:38,600
- But Elijah is standing right here. - She was pushed down to me though.

289
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,139
All right. Now, Sun Mi and I are a team now.

290
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,509
We'll bring in the next guest. Please come on out!

291
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:48,980
("Red Flavor"?)

292
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,149
- What is it? - "Red Flavor"?

293
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:51,620
(It's Hwang Seung Un!)

294
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,190
- It's Hwang Seung Un! - It's Seung Un.

295
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,389
- She was on our show before. - It's Seung Un.

296
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,320
(Hwang Seung Un, the best physique)

297
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:04,000
(She's a rising star with multiple charms in the film industry.)

298
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,529
(She showed her bubbly, cheerful charms on Running Man before.)

299
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,240
- She's here. - The song is "Red Flavor".

300
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,539
(It's nice to see you again!)

301
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:16,610
(We're happy to see you too.)

302
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,309
- It's been a while. - Goodness, she's a real looker.

303
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:23,149
- It's been a while. - Long time no see.

304
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,580
- She joined us a long time ago. - That's right.

305
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,950
I heard that Seung Un...

306
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,559
takes a lot of photos of herself.

307
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:33,289
- She takes a lot of selfies. - She takes a lot of selfies?

308
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:36,029
Yes. She likes taking photos of herself and saving them.

309
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,559
"I'm saving it."

310
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,330
- Let's look at a few of her poses. - That'd be awesome.

311
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,899
- Pretend that you're at home. - Pretend you have the selfie stick.

312
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,169
In 1, 2, 3.

313
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:46,340
"Saving it."

314
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,009
(She poses as she pleases.)

315
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:52,179
Oh, my.

316
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:53,909
Goodness, she can bend her back a lot.

317
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:55,350
Her pose is very distinct from other people's.

318
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,980
Why don't we look at Sun Mi's pose?

319
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,320
- Me? - Yes.

320
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,950
- I bet she'll be great. - You take a lot of photos too.

321
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,320
All right, Sun Mi.

322
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,320
In 1, 2, 3. Clicking.

323
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,590
(Looking confident)

324
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,059
In 1, 2, 3. Clicking.

325
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:08,129
(Looking sexy)

326
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:09,730
- She's good. - Look at her expression.

327
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,059
- She's a professional. - She's a celebrity indeed.

328
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,500
I like that facial expression.

329
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,129
- She was excellent. - I can see she's very talented.

330
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:19,370
- Elijah, show us your poses. - Elijah, show us.

331
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,309
- Elijah, go for it! - Elijah...

332
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:25,340
Elijah, just do the poses you'd normally do.

333
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,450
Be confident. In 1, 2, 3. Clicking.

334
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,620
You should look over there, Elijah.

335
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,620
(She gazes at the camera after the camera shutter sound.)

336
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,559
- Do it when I make the sound. - Which camera do I look at?

337
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,759
- I guess she's drunk. - Do it at the camera shutter sound.

338
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,029
- Are you feeling okay? - Which camera is it?

339
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,629
- We should get her a driver. - I see. That's the camera.

340
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,759
- I'm calling a designated driver. - Let's give this another try.

341
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,100
- Elijah, try again. - We should call the driver.

342
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,429
- Just like this? - That's right.

343
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:50,840
Start, Elijah. In 1, 2, 3. Clicking.

344
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:53,509
Do the pose when I say, "clicking".

345
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:56,879
(Do the pose when I say, "clicking".)

346
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,610
She never listens.

347
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,710
- She's so stubborn. - I mean...

348
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,809
- she has her way of doing things. - Jong Kook, she's headstrong.

349
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:05,350
Elijah, it seems like you're not listening to me at all.

350
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,820
Do it when I make the sound. Look how Seung Un does it.

351
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,490
- In 1, 2, 3. Clicking. In 1, 2, 3. - I can't multitask.

352
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,860
- That's how you do it. - Now, I get it.

353
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:15,289
I think Kwang Soo has the best pose among us.

354
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:16,590
- I agree. - He's the best at it.

355
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,059
- He was a model. - He's tall.

356
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:20,730
In 1, 2, 3. Clicking. In 1, 2, 3. Clicking.

357
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,169
Hold on. Why...

358
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:26,269
(It's a busy photoshoot. He doesn't have time to change his poses.)

359
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:27,940
- Give me time to change my poses. - What?

360
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,940
- We don't have time. - How can I do it so quickly?

361
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,840
- Be grateful you had the chance. - You need to hurry.

362
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,179
- I had a pose in mind. - Goodness, you're unbelievable.

363
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:36,919
People are lining up for this. All of us want to take photos.

364
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,480
Clicking.

365
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,480
(Take my photo too.)

366
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,490
- Haha, why don't you try it? - That sounds great. Haha, try it.

367
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,590
See how fast he can do this. In 1, 2, 3. Clicking.

368
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,490
(I'm the fastest, and my poses are different from others'.)

369
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,889
Se Chan, it's your turn. Clicking, clicking, clicking.

370
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,529
(Taking photos one after another isn't a problem for me.)

371
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,629
Seung Un will pick now. Play the music!

372
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:56,769
(Time for Seung Un to choose)

373
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:59,070
- Please begin. - What should I do?

374
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,309
- You can start now. - Whom should I choose?

375
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:04,440
You can choose anyone. You'll just play games for a day.

376
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,509
Should I pick him?

377
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:07,580
(She approaches Seok Jin at the end just like everyone else.)

378
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,009
- Seok Jin is getting his hopes up. - Let's go.

379
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,320
(Will there be a twist?)

380
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,919
- What? - I choose him!

381
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,419
(It looked like she might choose Seok Jin, )

382
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:18,419
(but she turned around and chose Kwang Soo.)

383
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:19,789
(I'm finally getting a break.)

384
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:20,929
Goodness.

385
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:23,429
- Really? - This happened.

386
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,500
Am I a bus stop or something? Why do they always pass me by?

387
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,970
Seung Un and Kwang Soo will make one team.

388
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,070
(As of now, 3 couples have been formed.)

389
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,039
Let's bring in the next guest.

390
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:34,340
The matching will continue. Please come on out!

391
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:38,409
(What is this sad melody?)

392
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:42,450
(It seemed she wouldn't fall in love again, )

393
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,779
(but she visits Running Man only 3 months after her delivery.)

394
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:46,480
- It's Baek Z Young. - Z Young!

395
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,490
- Baek Z Young is here. - Z Young.

396
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,220
(Baek Z Young, the queen of singers)

397
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,320
- Z Young. - Oh, my. Z Young.

398
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,659
(She enters as she does ballet elegantly.)

399
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:58,230
(Z Young, it's so nice to see you.)

400
00:15:58,529 --> 00:15:59,559
Z Young!

401
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,570
(Dancing)

402
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,740
Z Young, you can't dance like that yet.

403
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,139
Z Young is still going strong! She's still awesome!

404
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,480
Goodness.

405
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,679
(She comes back to the show in healthy condition.)

406
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,080
Please come this way.

407
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,250
Congratulations on your delivery.

408
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,250
- Hasn't it been only three months? - I think so.

409
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,950
- It's been exactly three months. - Gosh.

410
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:24,919
- Can you be on TV? It's too soon. - I'm fine.

411
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,129
When we talk to Z Young,

412
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:30,860
- we must mention her husband. - I agree.

413
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:34,070
You said that your husband has a score of 99 points.

414
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:35,669
I did say that.

415
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:38,139
- Why did you deduct a point? - "I did say that."

416
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,370
If he's perfect, it'd be boring. So I deducted a point for him.

417
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,340
What about now? Is he keeping the points?

418
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,309
- Now, it's 100 points out of 100. - He got 1 more point.

419
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:46,980
- He got one more point. - Do you mean that?

420
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,649
- What's wrong with you? - He earned the last point...

421
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:50,379
with his love for our child.

422
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:51,879
(He's the perfect husband.)

423
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,919
You married such a great guy.

424
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,990
On the other hand, your husband gave you a low score.

425
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,320
- Seriously? - No, I was kidding.

426
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,389
- You startled me. - She was so surprised.

427
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:03,659
- She's still very responsive. - He would never do such a thing.

428
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:04,900
She hasn't changed.

429
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,769
- All right, Z Young. - This is nice.

430
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:08,569
- She's going to choose her partner. - Let's do this.

431
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,569
- Play the song. - Choose now.

432
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:14,039
(She starts exploring while looking sorrowful.)

433
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,680
- Z Young, long time no see. - Goodness, he's making me cry.

434
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,240
- Why? - I feel so bad for you.

435
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,680
- Nothing's wrong with me. - You can't understand the rules.

436
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,750
- That's not true. - So I can't choose you.

437
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,950
Z Young!

438
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,819
Just go that way then. Why did you have to tell me that?

439
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:29,720
Elijah, come out.

440
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,119
- Elijah! - Elijah.

441
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,630
- Elijah, don't go just yet. - Really?

442
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,289
- Jong Kook has to choose. - I know.

443
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,660
Z Young, please come this way.

444
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,700
(Should he protect Elijah who was once abandoned by Jae Seok?)

445
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,829
My friend.

446
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,140
(Whispering)

447
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,069
(What is the secret message he gave Z Young?)

448
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,980
I have to tell her to go?

449
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,980
(Elijah, can you come out now?)

450
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,079
- Tell her to go to Haha. - Really?

451
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,680
- I'm sorry. Please go. - Go to Haha, please.

452
00:17:56,819 --> 00:17:58,849
- She must be so happy. - Elijah.

453
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,289
(Even if she's being pushed down...)

454
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,160
Aren't we both from Changwon? How dare you step on me?

455
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,130
(Haha and Elijah become a couple regardless of their intentions.)

456
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,559
Let's bring in the next guest. Please come on out.

457
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,730
(Even her back looks cute.)

458
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,430
- It's Kei! - Hello!

459
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:18,640
(Looking cute)

460
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,339
- It's Kei of Lovelyz. - I know her!

461
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:24,609
(Kei of Lovelyz, master of cute acts)

462
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:28,680
(She's the representative idol singer with the cutest acts.)

463
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:33,019
- She's really pretty. - She's really joining us today?

464
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:35,750
Kei!

465
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,160
(She's cute indeed.)

466
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,720
I think her head looks smaller than last time.

467
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,829
- Really? - Yes.

468
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,130
- Thank you. - Do you know her? Are you close?

469
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,130
- I know her very well. - Stop it, Jae Seok.

470
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:47,529
Stop pretending to be everyone's friend.

471
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:49,769
- He knows everyone. - I know her very well.

472
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,809
All right. With Lovelyz's song...

473
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:55,809
- Their songs are like gems. - Kei, we'll play your song.

474
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:58,279
Please choose your partner. Play the song.

475
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,579
(Achoo)

476
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:05,980
(Overreacting)

477
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,819
She's so cute.

478
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,390
- She's cute. - She can dance pretty well.

479
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,990
She can dance.

480
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:14,089
- She's cute! - She changed instantly.

481
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:16,529
(Now, she is about to set out.)

482
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:20,069
(Or not? She starts dancing again.)

483
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,630
- How adorable. - Hold on.

484
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,599
Kei, I'm sorry to stop you. I like that you're dancing.

485
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,869
- It's good, but... - Tell her to stop dancing.

486
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:30,710
- You need to pick your partner. - I danced too long.

487
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,009
- Did you get that? - Yes.

488
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:33,480
(She responds to the song right away.)

489
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,079
You must choose your partner now.

490
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,720
- We'll try again. - Okay.

491
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:39,549
We'll play another song of Lovelyz.

492
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:40,819
- Kei! - She looks great when she dances.

493
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:42,490
Play the song for Kei!

494
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:47,930
(Kei is showing off another cute side of her.)

495
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,500
- I really love this song. - I have something to tell you

496
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,470
I choose you, Jae Seok.

497
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,869
This is Jae Seok's day.

498
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:58,039
(Excited)

499
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:00,569
- What's going on? - This isn't fun at all.

500
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:01,869
Is this some kind of a prank?

501
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,240
What is this?

502
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,710
- Goodness. - I'm envious.

503
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,210
- Unbelievable. - I'm sorry.

504
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:08,549
That's one of my favorite songs.

505
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:10,619
Sun Mi is in trouble now. What is she going to do?

506
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,519
Jae Seok is enjoying this.

507
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:14,289
This is such a dilemma for me.

508
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,859
- Kei. - Enjoy it while it lasts.

509
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:20,460
(Jae Seok is in a dilemma. The rule is harsh for the guests.)

510
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,630
(What will Jae Seok's decision be?)

511
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,299
- Kei, - Oh, my!

512
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:27,529
Bye.

513
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:30,640
- Kei. - Poor Kei.

514
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,940
It's all right, Kei.

515
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,339
Then what happens to me?

516
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:35,069
- That must feel so awkward. - Do I move one down?

517
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:36,269
- I don't get to choose? - Just like this?

518
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:38,240
(All the female guests must move one spot down.)

519
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,710
(What?)

520
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,809
(That means I have to...)

521
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:44,250
- Everyone will just move down? - Then Elijah will be my partner?

522
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,079
- I didn't have to come out early. - Okay!

523
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,289
- I knew this would happen! - I...

524
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,259
- Se Chan is happy. - I hope we make a good team.

525
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:52,789
- Welcome. - We'll be a team now.

526
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:57,859
(Elijah's turn is getting more elegant as she keeps moving down.)

527
00:20:57,859 --> 00:20:59,130
- Okay. - I see.

528
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,900
If Seung Un gets pushed just once...

529
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,670
- You... - This way.

530
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:07,740
If Seung Un moves once...

531
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,240
You...

532
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,039
- If you move... - I'm sure I'll move more than once.

533
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,279
- Right. - I'll move more than once.

534
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:14,349
You'll end up here.

535
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:16,750
(With me, you'll just be watching others.)

536
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:21,190
- Let's welcome the next guest. - I'm nervous.

537
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,250
(This is...)

538
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,420
I'm nervous.

539
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:27,529
(The versatile artist, Sol Bi)

540
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:28,630
- Who is it? - There's one more?

541
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:30,529
Sol Bi?

542
00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:31,529
(Hi, everyone.)

543
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:32,529
Gosh.

544
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,829
- Wait. - Hold on.

545
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,240
- We have to change tapes. - Who is it?

546
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,299
(When they're just about to change tapes, )

547
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,140
(Sol Bi enters dramatically.)

548
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:47,710
- Wait. - We have to change the tape.

549
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,509
We have to change the tape.

550
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:50,880
Ma'am, we're changing tapes.

551
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,049
- This is embarrassing. - We're sorry.

552
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:54,920
How embarrassing.

553
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,460
- To imagine that happened to me... - Sorry.

554
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,759
They have to change tapes.

555
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,589
(I put a lot of thought into how to enter.)

556
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,829
Why did she enter right then?

557
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:04,029
Are you ready?

558
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,059
One, two, three.

559
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,599
Let's go.

560
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,930
(How should I enter this time?)

561
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,339
- Who is it? - Who is it?

562
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:13,339
(Entering)

563
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:15,940
(Sol Bi pretends nothing happened.)

564
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,779
It's Sol Bi.

565
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:18,779
(I feel sorry for her.)

566
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:19,910
Hi.

567
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,809
(Just go to your place.)

568
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:24,849
(The sixth guest is Sol Bi.)

569
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:26,819
- Sol Bi. - Yes.

570
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:29,019
Please choose...

571
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:31,220
your partner.

572
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,220
- Yes. - All right.

573
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:35,059
- We'll play some music. - Yes.

574
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:36,160
Go to that person.

575
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,930
I have something to say.

576
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,430
- What is it? - What is it?

577
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,799
(It must be something very important.)

578
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:44,299
I recently shot a movie.

579
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:46,170
That's why I'm here.

580
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,069
- You can talk about it later. - That's why I'm here.

581
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:52,410
(Just pick someone.)

582
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,880
- Sol Bi. - You can talk about it in the car.

583
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,180
Hey.

584
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,680
- Hey. - Sol Bi.

585
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,250
Don't talk about it now.

586
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,190
Talk about it later.

587
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,420
When we eat, for example.

588
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,359
- We have a lot of time. - Okay, I'll wait.

589
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:06,019
- We have a lot of time. - Okay.

590
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:07,759
- I'm not sure. - Give us some music.

591
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:09,490
(Sol Bi will choose her partner.)

592
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:12,059
Here she comes.

593
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:14,299
(Turning)

594
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,039
You're so pretty. You look like Marilyn Monroe.

595
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,769
(Whom will she choose?)

596
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,940
Move.

597
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,809
(Seung Un, move.)

598
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,740
(Disappointed)

599
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,950
- Smile. - Sure.

600
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,710
- Smile. - I'm so thrilled.

601
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,349
- It's not like that. - Sol Bi, this way.

602
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,950
Sol Bi, come here.

603
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,049
What happens now?

604
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:36,549
- Seung Un! - Hey.

605
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,119
- Seung Un. - Hey.

606
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:39,759
Did I do something wrong?

607
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,029
How does it work?

608
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:42,289
Hey.

609
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:44,029
What's the rule?

610
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:45,859
(Kwang Soo was too thrilled.)

611
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:48,829
"Seung Un, move." And then Sol Bi is sent away.

612
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,599
You two are a team.

613
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:54,039
(Awkward)

614
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:55,869
They just had a conflict...

615
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,339
because of what he said.

616
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:00,509
I feel bad.

617
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:01,750
(We weren't expecting this.)

618
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,349
They're a spear and a shield.

619
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,220
- Sol Bi. - It's so awkward.

620
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,720
Why didn't you let her finish?

621
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:09,990
(All female guests have been introduced.)

622
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,490
(It's time to welcome the two female regular members.)

623
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,230
(Peeking)

624
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,430
- It's Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo.

625
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,859
- Ji Hyo. - Nucksal.

626
00:24:20,569 --> 00:24:22,430
She's dressed in a bohemian style.

627
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,599
She looks like Woo Won Jae.

628
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:24,599
Woo Won Jae. Nucksal.

629
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,940
- You're so pretty. - You look so cute.

630
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,039
(She is so relaxed.)

631
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,779
- She doesn't like us. - You look so pretty.

632
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,279
Hey, be quiet.

633
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:35,650
Woo Won Jae.

634
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,349
- Woo Won Jae. - Woo Won Jae.

635
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:38,849
She's a cute version of him.

636
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,089
Isn't she just a gangster?

637
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,660
Won Jae never does that.

638
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,819
- She just said that. - You've never seen him, have you?

639
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:47,029
I have.

640
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:48,029
(I know my hip hop.)

641
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,230
- Ji Hyo. - Yes.

642
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,329
- Please choose a partner. - All right.

643
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:54,329
- Please start. - Okay.

644
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:56,529
(Ji Hyo's decision will determine who will end up single.)

645
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:58,700
Ji Hyo's decision will...

646
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,640
determine who becomes single.

647
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:02,670
I see.

648
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:06,750
(Whom will Ji Hyo choose as her partner?)

649
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,210
She's standing in front of Se Chan.

650
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:11,849
Move.

651
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:13,420
(Elijah, move.)

652
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,289
- She wants to send Elijah away. - Goodness.

653
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,890
Se Chan, please choose one.

654
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,220
Se Chan.

655
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,130
- One... - I haven't changed my mind.

656
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,130
One, two, three.

657
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,859
(After Na Eun, )

658
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:27,500
(who will Se Chan choose?)

659
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,730
- Ji Hyo... - Really?

660
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,440
(Ji Hyo)

661
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
Go.

662
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
(Ji Hyo, go.)

663
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,539
(Ji Hyo becomes a team with Kwang Soo.)

664
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:37,839
That sounded so decisive.

665
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,440
I'm sorry.

666
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,680
- All right. - What about me?

667
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,710
Seung Un, please stand here.

668
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,950
- I choose Seung Un. - Are they moving?

669
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:46,650
- Seung Un. - Seung Un.

670
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:48,049
Sol Bi.

671
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,529
- I don't have a partner? - Sol Bi...

672
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:55,430
(I thought it was a Couple Race.)

673
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,029
Oh, my gosh.

674
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,430
Sol Bi has no partner now.

675
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,130
Seung Un might...

676
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:03,740
lose her partner too.

677
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,339
- That's right. - Seung Un too?

678
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:08,509
If So Min chooses Seok Jin...

679
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:10,140
- Then... - Then...

680
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,440
- Seok Jin will choose between them. - I'll choose one.

681
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,440
- Right. - I see.

682
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:15,779
But it's not likely that So Min will choose Seok Jin.

683
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:17,079
That means Seung Un will have to move.

684
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,680
(Straightforward)

685
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,789
- Don't say that. - Z Young!

686
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,849
Don't say that out loud.

687
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:25,089
Just keep it to yourself.

688
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:28,789
Okay. It might not affect me, right?

689
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,700
We all know that.

690
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,869
All right. Let's welcome So Min.

691
00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:35,769
- Please come out! - So Min!

692
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,700
Come on!

693
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,410
(Bouncing)

694
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:41,539
Magnet Girl.

695
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,039
Parrot, Frog,

696
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:47,579
Magnet Girl, Idiot...

697
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:51,049
It's So Min's turn. Give us some music.

698
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,720
- Come pick. - So Min, you're so cute.

699
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,559
Our frog.

700
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:59,319
- She's so cute. - She's cute.

701
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,460
Our cute frog.

702
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,400
Oh, my.

703
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,529
Our parrot.

704
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:08,529
- Move. - Me?

705
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,269
Why am I so popular?

706
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,700
- Move. - Me?

707
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,740
Why am I so popular?

708
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,539
Do I look so easy?

709
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:17,410
(Realization)

710
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:21,180
Why does everyone pass me by?

711
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,980
There are other guys too.

712
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,650
Do I look that easy?

713
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,849
You're just popular.

714
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:28,349
Ji Hyo and So Min...

715
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:30,519
feel most comfortable with Se Chan.

716
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:33,359
It's an honor.

717
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:37,029
Se Chan, please choose between So Min and Elijah.

718
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:38,329
One, two, three.

719
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:41,869
Elijah...

720
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,440
(Elijah)

721
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,839
Go.

722
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,500
- I knew it. - "Elijah, go?"

723
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,970
- Yes. - What?

724
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,240
Are you serious?

725
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,910
What's with you?

726
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,650
- So Min. - I'm feeling burdened.

727
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:56,509
(Are you serious?)

728
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,680
(There's someone who is more uncomfortable.)

729
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,779
No.

730
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:00,450
Why are you turning?

731
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,119
(Don't pretend you're okay.)

732
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,130
The two from King Kong Entertainment are a team now.

733
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,799
Yes. Boss...

734
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,900
(We love you, Boss.)

735
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:19,140
All teams have been decided.

736
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,140
Seung Un and Sol Bi have no partners right now.

737
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,339
But it's not over yet.

738
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:25,339
Really?

739
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:28,650
(It's not over yet?)

740
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,079
We have two male guests too.

741
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,190
(2 male guests are coming.)

742
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,859
(We'll get partners too.)

743
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,759
Give up on me.

744
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:40,589
Please give up on me.

745
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:43,059
Will the female guests get to choose?

746
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:45,500
If the male guests send someone away,

747
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,230
the female guests will choose between the two.

748
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,500
(The girls get to take revenge.)

749
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,599
The male guests will send someone away.

750
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,339
(Whoever the guests are, we don't have much chance.)

751
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:55,670
All right. Let's welcome the next guest.

752
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,839
- Please come out. - Who is it?

753
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:57,839
Who is it?

754
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:04,180
(There are too few guys now.)

755
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,650
(That's why male guests were invited.)

756
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,960
(A romantic song plays.)

757
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,890
(The first male guest)

758
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:14,890
It's Sung Hoon.

759
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,730
(The handsome guy, Sung Hoon)

760
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,730
(It's Sung Hoon.)

761
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,799
He's so handsome.

762
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:25,299
(The good kisser with a fit body, Sung Hoon)

763
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:27,240
He's so handsome.

764
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:29,109
He's too handsome.

765
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:34,109
Sung Hoon has had fan meetings abroad.

766
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:36,579
He's becoming very popular.

767
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,150
- He's a new prince. - Really?

768
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,519
He's a new prince.

769
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:42,950
So Min recently...

770
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:44,660
You made a cameo appearance.

771
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,390
- That's right. - You know him?

772
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,390
Yes.

773
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:52,730
(So Min seduced Sung Hoon in the drama.)

774
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,799
How was So Min to work with?

775
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,339
She's not normal.

776
00:29:58,339 --> 00:29:59,599
(So Min is not an ordinary girl.)

777
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,170
She isn't.

778
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,140
So Min, how was it to work with Sung Hoon?

779
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,509
It was very romantic.

780
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:08,349
- Why? - We hadn't met before,

781
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:10,819
but he pushed me against the wall.

782
00:30:10,819 --> 00:30:12,680
He thinks you're not normal.

783
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,789
(Are you sure it was romantic?)

784
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:15,890
- It was romantic? - For me, yes.

785
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,819
(Who will Sung Hoon choose?)

786
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:19,789
Sung Hoon, can you dance?

787
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:21,890
- Sure. - Okay.

788
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:22,990
Play the music.

789
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,930
(Shy)

790
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,869
(Excited)

791
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:35,339
(What?)

792
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:36,339
(It's a choo, choo train.)

793
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:38,210
That was unexpected.

794
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,740
What's that?

795
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,880
What are you doing?

796
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,920
What is this move?

797
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,049
It's an idol group's dance.

798
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:49,250
It's very simple.

799
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,289
What is this?

800
00:30:50,859 --> 00:30:53,059
Can you show us more?

801
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,490
Okay.

802
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:58,230
Don't be nervous. Please play the music.

803
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:01,829
(Sung Hoon says it's an idol group's dance.)

804
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,940
(Sung Hoon learned this move from an idol group.)

805
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,869
(They're excited.)

806
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:10,940
(He shows off his train dance.)

807
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:14,349
- That's attractive. - That's the idol dance?

808
00:31:14,349 --> 00:31:16,309
(And it's off beat.)

809
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,279
- That's attractive. - That's the idol dance?

810
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:19,349
(It doesn't make sense at all.)

811
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,349
(You shouldn't use your looks that way.)

812
00:31:21,349 --> 00:31:23,519
- He's so cute! - Goodness.

813
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,619
- Goodness. - Good job.

814
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:27,430
- He's so cute. - That was cute.

815
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,990
- I think... - That was cute.

816
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,299
Wait a second. You tried to act a little cute just now, right?

817
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:32,559
His dance style is...

818
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:36,170
I'm shocked that idols actually do those dance moves.

819
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:39,700
- I can't think of anyone. - It can't be compared to any moves.

820
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,069
- I think I can copy it though. - Kei.

821
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:43,980
You know a lot of idol groups. Tell me which dance move it was.

822
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,240
But it's part of our choreography too.

823
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,680
- Really? - Show us.

824
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:49,180
- Our... - Are you serious?

825
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,420
Like this and that.

826
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,390
It's similar to this.

827
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:56,420
Like this and that.

828
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,089
It's similar to this.

829
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,319
I don't think so.

830
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,059
Are you saying it's similar to how he just danced?

831
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,589
Hold on.

832
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,859
- I think we spoiled her. - How's that similar?

833
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:07,230
- Isn't it similar? - What?

834
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:09,099
She just promoted her choreography.

835
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:11,700
(It was just to promote their dance moves.)

836
00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:12,970
Don't put it that way.

837
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,369
It's not like she's not allowed to do that.

838
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:16,369
- That's enough. - It's okay.

839
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,109
You know what?

840
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:20,509
He did it in a cute way,

841
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:22,380
but it's easy to look like an idiot with that dance.

842
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:25,950
- Totally. - Goodness.

843
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:28,349
- He's had enough. Let's stop here. - All right.

844
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:29,549
I'm sorry.

845
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:35,130
Now, Sung Hoon will choose his partner.

846
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:38,859
The male members will have to move this time.

847
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:40,200
- Really? - Do we have to move?

848
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,299
- We have a strong bond here. - All right, music...

849
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:43,329
- please. - It's unpredictable.

850
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:47,009
(With whom does Sung Hoon want to partner up?)

851
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:55,079
(Disappointed)

852
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,549
(Holding out his hand)

853
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:01,150
(But he walks past them.)

854
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,750
Wait, So Min.

855
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:04,119
What's wrong with you, So Min?

856
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:06,019
- What's wrong with you? - She's excited.

857
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:07,259
Why are you excited?

858
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:09,390
- Why is she excited? - That must be it.

859
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,630
Come out.

860
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,660
It's me again?

861
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:12,859
- That must be it. - Come out.

862
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:13,869
It's me again?

863
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:14,970
(Flustered)

864
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,069
Hold on. Do all of you think I'm easy?

865
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,039
Do you think I'm easy or what?

866
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:22,109
Do you think I'm a rest stop or what?

867
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:23,910
Let's just say you're popular.

868
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,279
- Think about it. - Everyone likes you.

869
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,750
- Don't think of it that way. - It means you're a nice person.

870
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,420
Let's say this is like a long highway.

871
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:32,019
- He's the rest stop. - You should be the rest stop.

872
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:33,589
- Se Chan is. - Everyone meets here.

873
00:33:33,589 --> 00:33:34,690
Where you are is...

874
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,720
- If we think this as a highway... - I'm in the middle.

875
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:39,359
And So Min was so...

876
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:41,460
I thought So Min was...

877
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,289
- a bride on her wedding day. - Right.

878
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,859
She was waiting for him.

879
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,730
(Standing like a bride waiting for her groom)

880
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:56,569
(The world's coolest groom and the bride's father)

881
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:59,880
(So Min had her imaginary wedding.)

882
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:02,180
She really was waiting for him to come.

883
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,279
(Her imagination came true.)

884
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,619
- But So Min has to choose too. - All right.

885
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:06,920
- That's right. - So Min.

886
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:08,090
1, 2, 3.

887
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,250
I choose Sung Hoon.

888
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,360
(You don't need to ask.)

889
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,159
Bye, Se Chan.

890
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,389
(I won't see you off.)

891
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:18,099
So the male members have to move to their next places.

892
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
That means Seok Jin will end up being my partner again.

893
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,340
Sol Bi, strangely...

894
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,800
They'll end up together.

895
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,170
- Sol Bi, you never know. - I have this feeling.

896
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,639
There's one more guest left.

897
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,179
- I'm excited. - I'm excited to find out who.

898
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,110
- Who is it? - Our last guest.

899
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,550
- It must be a male guest. - Goodness.

900
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,550
Sung Hoon has joined us as our guest.

901
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,420
(Who is today's special guest showing up after Sung Hoon?)

902
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,550
Will it be a member of Wanna One?

903
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,690
(Wanna One is hot these days.)

904
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,920
- Wanna One? - Wanna One?

905
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,030
- Wanna One? - Kang Daniel?

906
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,300
- Kang Daniel? - Kang Daniel?

907
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,829
- Kang Daniel? - Kang Daniel?

908
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:57,300
(Kang Daniel is the center of the hottest idol group, Wanna One.)

909
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,869
(He's the star among his older female fans.)

910
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:00,909
Goodness.

911
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,869
- There's the helicam. - Goodness.

912
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:04,110
Wanna One!

913
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,079
- Awesome. - I guess it's true.

914
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:07,349
The helicam is up.

915
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:09,550
- They don't use that camera often. - The helicam is up.

916
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,679
(They usually don't fly the helicam during the guest appearance.)

917
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:11,750
I guess it's really Wanna One.

918
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,389
Who is it?

919
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,619
What?

920
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:19,889
(Wanna One's song is played.)

921
00:35:19,889 --> 00:35:21,860
- Is it really Wanna One? - Really?

922
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:24,199
(Regardless of gender, everyone shouted their names.)

923
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:27,300
- It's me - It's me

924
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,170
(The Running Man members mentioned the group so often.)

925
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,869
All right. Who is our last guest?

926
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:35,639
(The last guest is here to steal the female guests' hearts.)

927
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:39,340
(Today's last male guest is both sexy and cute.)

928
00:35:40,409 --> 00:35:42,079
(You've waited for long.)

929
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,750
(Are you serious?)

930
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,820
(Tonight's real guest whom everyone waited for)

931
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,489
(It's Cho Daniel.)

932
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:58,199
(Why did you come out of there?)

933
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,800
(Disappointed)

934
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:09,769
(Ji Hyo, it's me.)

935
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:13,039
(He's the star among his older male fans.)

936
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:14,650
You're too old.

937
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:15,909
Let's drag him out.

938
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,519
Jae Seok, let's drag him out.

939
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,949
(Cho Sae Ho)

940
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:20,619
Among all of us,

941
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:21,920
- Ji Hyo... - Ji Hyo...

942
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:24,289
is very much disappointed.

943
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,989
She really wanted it to be Kang Daniel.

944
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:28,460
But I'm determined.

945
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:31,000
(He's not Kang Daniel, but he's determined.)

946
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,099
(The staff made a mistake.)

947
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:33,429
- Not Kang Daniel. - He's not Kang Daniel,

948
00:36:33,429 --> 00:36:34,869
- but he's determined. - I am.

949
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:36,429
Determination runs in my family.

950
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,039
It's possible.

951
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,340
Sae Ho.

952
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,269
- You came out not long ago. - I did.

953
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:44,239
How about you say goodbye here today?

954
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,239
Say goodbye? Me?

955
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,909
Because you joined us not long ago,

956
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:51,150
what do you think about not joining us today?

957
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,820
- Is there such a system? - That sounds great.

958
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,920
You won't do that?

959
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:55,789
- Aren't you busy today? - I have my own circumstances.

960
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:57,690
- I see. - He has his own circumstances.

961
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,690
All right.

962
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,230
To whom are you doing that?

963
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,260
(He keeps on giving that gesture.)

964
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,460
I'm saving the tree at the back in my heart.

965
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,030
We're invisible to him.

966
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:06,530
He's looking for something else.

967
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:09,099
He's not interested in us. He's looking at something else.

968
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,239
Goodness.

969
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,840
(Click)

970
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,239
What was that?

971
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:15,510
- Goodness! - He took a photo with his eye.

972
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,210
What's wrong with him?

973
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,050
I'll just go home.

974
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,449
(Dispirited)

975
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,679
(But now that you're here, share some funny stories with us.)

976
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,349
Sae Ho,

977
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:30,590
you came on Running Man not long ago.

978
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:34,389
I had no idea you'd be joining us today again.

979
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,929
- Now you know. - Yes.

980
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,960
- Are we done shooting? - That was too short.

981
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,269
I was offered to come out by the staff like all the others.

982
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:46,469
- That's why I'm here today. - If that's really the case,

983
00:37:46,469 --> 00:37:48,369
- who asked you to come out? - To be specific,

984
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:50,340
it was the scriptwriter, Lim Eun Kyung.

985
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,539
That's right.

986
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:53,280
So I passed?

987
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:55,949
- It's sure he was cast officially. - Three more to go.

988
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:57,420
Pass two more stages, and you're good to be here.

989
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,820
- Really? What stages? - Two more stages to go.

990
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,320
I'm checking just in case. Some idle people...

991
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:05,690
come to our show when they're not invited.

992
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,929
Are you serious? There were people who did that?

993
00:38:08,429 --> 00:38:11,099
So we need to be strict in checking whether they're our real guests.

994
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:12,199
Because...

995
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:14,530
I understand you. Those steps are necessary.

996
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,369
- Right. - Right.

997
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:17,699
- Sae Ho. - Yes?

998
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,170
Shall we start with an acrostic poem?

999
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,570
- An acrostic poem? - Yes.

1000
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,340
(All of a sudden?)

1001
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:25,880
- An acrostic poem? - Hold on.

1002
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,380
Write your name with your bottom.

1003
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,280
- What? - With my bottom?

1004
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:30,480
I'm sorry,

1005
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,980
but Sol Bi...

1006
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,150
This isn't a team gathering.

1007
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,489
I won't allow that.

1008
00:38:36,489 --> 00:38:38,360
They don't write names with their bottoms even during team gatherings.

1009
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:40,059
Why did you ask for it all of a sudden?

1010
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:41,630
Well, I thought he'd do a great job.

1011
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:45,829
When he came out last time, he showed off his "New Face" dance.

1012
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:47,099
That was awesome.

1013
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:49,699
- Na Eun chose him. - He placed first.

1014
00:38:51,139 --> 00:38:53,269
(During the 7th year anniversary special)

1015
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:54,510
I heard you prepared something.

1016
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,340
- I did? - Yes.

1017
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:01,150
(He wasn't prepared, but he managed to show off the "New Face" dance.)

1018
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,719
- You prepared Tae Yang's "Darling"? - I did?

1019
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:06,380
(He prepared to dance to Tae Yang's "Darling".)

1020
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,489
It's a new song.

1021
00:39:07,489 --> 00:39:08,619
(He's always prepared.)

1022
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:10,559
- I'm not prepared for it. - Goodness.

1023
00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:13,159
That song just came out though. He's awesome indeed.

1024
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:15,860
There's nothing about "Darling" in the script.

1025
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:18,030
Save it in your eyes.

1026
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:20,969
I didn't prepare to do the "Darling" dance.

1027
00:39:20,969 --> 00:39:24,340
The director even signed up for the service.

1028
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,300
I'd like you to not cast me if you're going to be like this.

1029
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:29,039
If you're going to be like this.

1030
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:30,179
Sae Ho, then...

1031
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:31,380
Shall I start?

1032
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,710
(He'll still try it.)

1033
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:33,949
- Please start. - All right.

1034
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,210
Go for it!

1035
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:39,750
(Sae Ho will dance to Tae Yang's "Darling".)

1036
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:45,360
(The key points are the charismatic dance and the passionate look.)

1037
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:51,730
(You are the hope in all my fears)

1038
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,670
It's not bad.

1039
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,099
You've got the feeling.

1040
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,039
Nice.

1041
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,170
Nice.

1042
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:03,409
You're like Tae Yang.

1043
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:04,940
- You're really like Tae Yang. - You're good.

1044
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:07,550
What?

1045
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,110
(The song heads to its climax.)

1046
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,449
- What? - He's going to do something.

1047
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,519
(Exposing his fair skin)

1048
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:18,690
(My gosh.)

1049
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,530
You...

1050
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,460
(He's under arrest for obscene performance.)

1051
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,699
- You're under arrest. - Goodness.

1052
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:29,969
- You're under arrest. - Why?

1053
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,369
What do you mean, why?

1054
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:33,469
Is this "Police" or something?

1055
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:35,010
- Yes. - Are we shooting "Police"?

1056
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,610
After a long stakeout,

1057
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:41,449
- I've caught this punk. - You're mistaken.

1058
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,650
- What... - Don't worry, everyone.

1059
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,179
Isn't this what everyone wears?

1060
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,219
Isn't this the kind of inner wear that everyone wears?

1061
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:50,219
(He has the freedom of expression.)

1062
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:53,090
Sae Ho, along with Tae Yang's song as the background,

1063
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,260
(It's time for Sae Ho to choose his partner.)

1064
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,760
go to someone whom you want to partner up with.

1065
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:02,369
(Sae Ho's choice will change the other couples' fate.)

1066
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,570
(What about me, Z Young?)

1067
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,739
As if.

1068
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,480
(He makes sure he throws in pointless dance moves.)

1069
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,150
He can dance well.

1070
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,550
- I'm envious. - So am I.

1071
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:21,690
What is this?

1072
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:23,320
Did he choose her?

1073
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,090
(He stops in front of Seung Un. He chooses...)

1074
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:27,530
- It's Ji Hyo? - He chose Ji Hyo?

1075
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:30,059
- Kwang Soo, come out! - Is this really happening?

1076
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:31,360
Please make your decision, Ji Hyo.

1077
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,230
Okay. You, leave.

1078
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:36,199
- How can she choose so easily? - Why?

1079
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,139
- Are you being serious now? - What's wrong with that?

1080
00:41:38,139 --> 00:41:39,639
Ji Hyo, you can't do that.

1081
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:43,110
- Sae Ho, come here. - What? Kwang Soo is happy anyway.

1082
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:45,010
All right then.

1083
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,110
- Kwang Soo is smiling. - You're so funny.

1084
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,750
- Kwang Soo is smiling. - Now, he can smile.

1085
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:52,380
(Current status report on couples)

1086
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,190
(With their partners, they begin their mission.)

1087
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,519
As you all know,

1088
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:59,460
the mission money is very important in the Half and Half Project Part 2.

1089
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,690
Starting now, you can earn additional money with this mission.

1090
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,900
The mission, What's Your Charm?, begins now.

1091
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,670
(What's Your Charm?)

1092
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,099
(Should I show them my charm?)

1093
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:10,269
I like this.

1094
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:11,769
- "What's Your Charm?" - I like this.

1095
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,769
You'll hear keywords of your partner's best charms.

1096
00:42:15,769 --> 00:42:18,739
Or if you think your partner's charm is better,

1097
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:20,409
you can challenge the couple.

1098
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,480
Whoever takes the first place...

1099
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,849
will receive 10 dollars as their additional mission money.

1100
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:28,449
- Okay. - 10 dollars?

1101
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:29,949
The key is that you must win...

1102
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:32,590
the game that you said you'd be best at.

1103
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,860
All right. Who wants to go first?

1104
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,389
Z Young will start us off.

1105
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:37,559
- Me? - Sweet!

1106
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,329
What are you good at?

1107
00:42:39,329 --> 00:42:42,030
My partner has a lot of things she's good at.

1108
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,940
- Like? - First off, she's good at fighting.

1109
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,010
(She can be scary.)

1110
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,510
(She used to rule the music industry with her fist.)

1111
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:51,210
- She's good indeed. - That's important.

1112
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,809
That's important. Fighting is an important skill.

1113
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,780
Among many things, she's best at...

1114
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:58,650
- singing sad songs. - She's the best, hands down.

1115
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:00,949
- She's the master of them. - She's the queen.

1116
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:03,519
(Singing songs in the saddest manner)

1117
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:05,559
Whatever the song may be,

1118
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:07,460
- She can make it sound sad. - she makes the song sound sad.

1119
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:16,000
(Z Young is the expert in singing sorrowful songs.)

1120
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:23,139
(Regardless of the genres, she can make anything sound sad.)

1121
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,110
- Can you show us a few songs? - Okay.

1122
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,610
- Which one should I sing? - He will sing the song...

1123
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:30,480
- Okay. - "Lovely" in the original version.

1124
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,250
She will sing the song right after he finishes.

1125
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:36,760
I already feel sad when I hear Jong Kook sing the song.

1126
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,760
(Why?)

1127
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,760
You do?

1128
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,389
I feel sad when you do the dance like this.

1129
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,360
When you dance with your shoulders like this,

1130
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,000
- that makes me sad. - Should I make yours narrow then?

1131
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:46,500
Just like this?

1132
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,469
(I didn't mean it like that.)

1133
00:43:48,469 --> 00:43:49,630
Goodness.

1134
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:51,369
Stop it.

1135
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:55,369
- Jong Kook, sing the song first. - I'll sing "Lovely" first?

1136
00:43:55,369 --> 00:43:56,739
(We'll listen to the cheerful version first.)

1137
00:43:56,739 --> 00:44:01,250
You're lovely from head to toe

1138
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:05,349
(How will Z Young, the queen of sorrow, sing the song?)

1139
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:11,059
I'm proud that you're my lady

1140
00:44:11,059 --> 00:44:12,219
This is driving me crazy.

1141
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:18,000
(The lyrics are happy, but her mournful voice is making us cry.)

1142
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,929
Just like this

1143
00:44:20,929 --> 00:44:22,769
I love you

1144
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:23,969
No!

1145
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,539
(He breaks down.)

1146
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,440
She's making me cry.

1147
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:35,010
But can't everyone do this if they sing it slowly?

1148
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:36,650
- No! - That's not true.

1149
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:38,750
- That's not true. - No! What's wrong with you?

1150
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,519
Sing it then. Why don't you sing it yourself?

1151
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:42,550
- Try singing it then. - I'll sing the same song.

1152
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:47,260
(What's wrong with his mouth?)

1153
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,829
What was that?

1154
00:44:48,929 --> 00:44:50,960
Whom are you trying to kid?

1155
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,369
Let's try singing an upbeat song.

1156
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:57,570
- Let's sing a children's song. - How about this?

1157
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,139
- Sing the tadpole song. - Okay.

1158
00:44:59,139 --> 00:45:00,739
- Kei, why don't you sing it first? - She can sing it right away.

1159
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,239
- Kei, please sing it. - I'll sing it then.

1160
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:05,639
(She's full of cuteness.)

1161
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:08,949
The tadpole was swimming

1162
00:45:09,449 --> 00:45:10,980
(She's getting her sadness on.)

1163
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,150
It's my turn now.

1164
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:17,860
The foreleg comes out, the hind leg comes out

1165
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:19,519
- Wait. - Jumping

1166
00:45:20,059 --> 00:45:21,630
(The verification process is stopped.)

1167
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:23,500
- Wait, this sounded a bit... - No, you got it wrong.

1168
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,000
- I was trying to make it sound sad. - But this...

1169
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,900
- How is this sad? - You just sang it slowly.

1170
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,369
- Why is this weird? - It sounded too erotic.

1171
00:45:29,369 --> 00:45:32,400
- You turned it into a weird song. - It's because...

1172
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,769
- That was so weird. - Z Young, you breathed heavily.

1173
00:45:34,769 --> 00:45:36,309
I felt pressured.

1174
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:38,409
Now, the song became all weird.

1175
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:40,610
- It hurt when the leg came out. - Exactly.

1176
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:44,050
All right. Z Young...

1177
00:45:44,179 --> 00:45:46,989
showed that she could make any song into a sad song.

1178
00:45:46,989 --> 00:45:48,349
Is there anyone who would like to challenge her?

1179
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,820
Sae Ho can do it!

1180
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,159
Sae Ho will try now.

1181
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:54,989
I'm not ready yet.

1182
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,099
No, Sae Ho can do this.

1183
00:45:57,099 --> 00:46:00,929
Ji Hyo is ready to make me try this,

1184
00:46:00,929 --> 00:46:02,269
- Sae Ho. - but I'm not ready to try.

1185
00:46:02,269 --> 00:46:05,639
We've been rolling for a long time now.

1186
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:07,170
Then can't someone else try first?

1187
00:46:07,269 --> 00:46:08,809
- I got it. - Okay.

1188
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:10,309
- Which song will you sing? - I'll sing something else.

1189
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,039
- Okay. - I'll sing Wanna One's "Pick Me".

1190
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:13,710
- All right. That's great. - He'll make that sound sad?

1191
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:16,280
- Okay. - That one could be hard.

1192
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,650
- You can make that sound sad? - Get ready.

1193
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:20,920
Start.

1194
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,820
(He gathers all the sad feelings he has.)

1195
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,760
("Pick Me" is a dance song that makes everyone excited.)

1196
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,929
(How will Sae Ho sing the song sadly?)

1197
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,400
Tonight

1198
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,199
(He fails.)

1199
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:37,070
(He fails after singing only one line.)

1200
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,300
That didn't sound like Wanna One's song.

1201
00:46:38,539 --> 00:46:40,369
- It didn't? - No, it didn't.

1202
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:42,269
(That's the reason why I failed?)

1203
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:43,409
You didn't sound like Wanna One.

1204
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:44,780
- Are you serious? - Yes, I am.

1205
00:46:45,309 --> 00:46:49,079
Why do they always put on a skit? Do you guys practice together?

1206
00:46:49,909 --> 00:46:50,920
Okay.

1207
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,579
- Really? - She's ready.

1208
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:53,820
- I got it. - I'll get going.

1209
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,219
- Elijah will try it. - Really?

1210
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,389
- She's been preparing this. - No.

1211
00:46:57,389 --> 00:46:59,619
- Really? - You can give this a try.

1212
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:07,199
(When the mission started, she tried to bring out her sad emotions.)

1213
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,329
Think of the sad feelings you had, and bring them out.

1214
00:47:09,699 --> 00:47:10,800
(Don't distract me.)

1215
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,969
I'm sorry.

1216
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:15,239
(She'll try singing "Unconditional" as she focuses on her emotion.)

1217
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:20,449
My love for you

1218
00:47:20,949 --> 00:47:25,849
(This song has transformed into a sorrowful song.)

1219
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:28,449
My love

1220
00:47:28,449 --> 00:47:30,659
For you

1221
00:47:30,659 --> 00:47:33,659
(Fail)

1222
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:36,260
- She was out of tune. - No, no.

1223
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,500
- I didn't know the song well. - You were out of tune.

1224
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,900
- She was out of tune. - We'll accept it.

1225
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,570
- She missed a note. - She...

1226
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:42,829
- She has to hit all the notes. - She can't do that.

1227
00:47:42,829 --> 00:47:45,769
I was nervous. Truth be told, I was getting nervous this time.

1228
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,739
Z Young, it was close.

1229
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,139
You might've lost.

1230
00:47:50,139 --> 00:47:51,510
I was nervous this time.

1231
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:53,349
- You could've lost. - You're right.

1232
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:54,710
- She sings well though. - I thought I'd lose.

1233
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:56,719
- She can sing. - Right.

1234
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:57,949
It's over now.

1235
00:47:57,949 --> 00:47:59,349
- So Min, will you try it? - Me?

1236
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,389
- So Min, give this a shot. - Try it.

1237
00:48:01,949 --> 00:48:04,360
I have to feel sad for this. Let me poke my eyes.

1238
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,829
- She said she'll poke her eyes. - Let me poke my eyes.

1239
00:48:06,829 --> 00:48:08,590
(Poke her eyes? She's unusual from the start.)

1240
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:11,730
(She tries to feel sad with the tears she forced to come out.)

1241
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:13,429
- Can I start from the top? - Yes.

1242
00:48:14,929 --> 00:48:17,400
(So Min, good luck.)

1243
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,269
(How sad will she sound?)

1244
00:48:22,269 --> 00:48:24,980
(She's almost sobbing.)

1245
00:48:25,309 --> 00:48:27,280
(So Min fails.)

1246
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,349
- Even from the start, she was... - What are you doing?

1247
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:31,349
- How can you cry and sing? - I was trying to sound sad.

1248
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,050
(Sing without crying.)

1249
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:38,119
(Wailing)

1250
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:40,389
- Is this her drunk? - I think she might be.

1251
00:48:40,429 --> 00:48:41,690
(Are you drunk?)

1252
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:44,329
- This is Drunk Singing Method. - I thought she was drunk.

1253
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,000
(I'm not drunk.)

1254
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,199
(Hiccuping)

1255
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:55,739
(The tadpoles were swimming)

1256
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:58,639
That was her drunk singing method.

1257
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,480
(So Min fails as she sounds drunk, not sad.)

1258
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,650
- She was too emotional. - I can't force it.

1259
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,150
- I think I'm ready now. - Sorry?

1260
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,920
- I know how to do this now. - Then do that next time.

1261
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:10,059
- Okay. - Then do that next time.

1262
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:11,489
(He's very nonchalant.)

1263
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:12,760
- I'll be going now. - Okay.

1264
00:49:13,489 --> 00:49:14,559
- Really? - One more time.

1265
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,929
- Z Young won! - Z Young will take this round.

1266
00:49:17,699 --> 00:49:19,099
10 dollars!

1267
00:49:19,099 --> 00:49:20,730
(Haha and Z Young win 10 dollars.)

1268
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:24,199
Next up is Seung Un.

1269
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:25,599
(What is her charm?)

1270
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:28,010
Seung Un's charm is...

1271
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:29,710
that she's sexy by nature,

1272
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,739
but her real charm is that she can do sexy dance moves.

1273
00:49:32,739 --> 00:49:35,780
(Sexy dance moves)

1274
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:39,050
But don't forget that Sun Mi is here.

1275
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:41,119
- Z Young started doing them first. - No, I didn't.

1276
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,949
- No. - She's the very first, sexy diva.

1277
00:49:42,949 --> 00:49:45,320
Her dance moves are sexy, but they are exciting at the same time.

1278
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:47,090
They are exciting too.

1279
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:48,530
This will be hard then.

1280
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:50,829
You have to do the dance moves too.

1281
00:49:50,829 --> 00:49:52,329
- Really? - Yes.

1282
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,429
We should look at Seung Un's dance moves first.

1283
00:49:55,429 --> 00:49:56,469
Seung Un, please begin.

1284
00:49:56,469 --> 00:49:58,539
- I'm so embarrassed. - Her dance will be difference.

1285
00:49:58,539 --> 00:50:00,670
- Let's get it. - I'll dance out of excitement.

1286
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:02,409
Drop the beat, drop the beat!

1287
00:50:02,409 --> 00:50:03,539
Let's get it.

1288
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:04,780
They are so funny.

1289
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:09,280
Seung Un is good at dancing.

1290
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:15,949
(As soon as the song is played, she transforms into someone else.)

1291
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,159
She's so good at dancing.

1292
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:21,190
(After warming up, she releases her excitement as she shakes her head.)

1293
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,690
Goodness! She's awesome.

1294
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:23,929
(After warming up, she releases her excitement as she shakes her head.)

1295
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:27,570
(She's good. This won't be an easy fight.)

1296
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,630
- She's no joke. - Her moves are fancy.

1297
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,269
(Sliding down)

1298
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:36,139
(She gives them no time to be distracted. She catches their eyes.)

1299
00:50:36,139 --> 00:50:37,909
Seung Un is truly good at dancing.

1300
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:40,309
(As they're fascinated by her dance, the battle is forgotten.)

1301
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,250
She's born to be a dancer.

1302
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:44,050
(Goodness, Seung Un is showing off her charm.)

1303
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:45,320
She's born to be a dancer.

1304
00:50:46,449 --> 00:50:51,519
(It's time for her to share her excitement with the rest of them.)

1305
00:50:51,989 --> 00:50:53,289
Here it comes!

1306
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,190
This is the climax. Here it is!

1307
00:50:56,659 --> 00:50:59,130
(She begins her sexy shuffle dance.)

1308
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,329
She's shuffling.

1309
00:51:00,699 --> 00:51:03,329
(She's shuffling? I don't think I can beat her.)

1310
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,210
(She has fabulous dance skills.)

1311
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:09,139
She's a great dancer.

1312
00:51:09,139 --> 00:51:12,210
(I'll be the winner.)

1313
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:16,250
She was sexy at first and then cute.

1314
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,019
- Thank you, Seung Un. - You're right.

1315
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:19,320
What happens?

1316
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,750
Do you have to be sexy to win?

1317
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,150
She did a great job.

1318
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,960
We'll go last.

1319
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,619
- Let's see So Min's dance. - Me?

1320
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:27,989
- So suddenly? - Play the music.

1321
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,860
- Me? - Here she comes.

1322
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,829
- Sexy dance? - You can earn 10 dollars.

1323
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:35,469
- 10 dollars? - Yes.

1324
00:51:35,469 --> 00:51:36,940
(Then...)

1325
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,210
(I'm here to win the money.)

1326
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:42,070
What?

1327
00:51:42,539 --> 00:51:43,579
Wait.

1328
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:46,750
(So Min, what are you doing?)

1329
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:48,449
What?

1330
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:49,849
She's doing great.

1331
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:51,380
Look at her face.

1332
00:51:51,579 --> 00:51:54,449
She wants to dance with him.

1333
00:51:54,449 --> 00:51:56,889
(Sung Hoon dances for the money too.)

1334
00:51:56,889 --> 00:51:58,519
Look at them.

1335
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:01,230
- They're both drunk. - They keep bumping into each other.

1336
00:52:01,329 --> 00:52:02,829
(Great teamwork)

1337
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:04,900
What are they doing?

1338
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,630
(Does she want me to sit down too?)

1339
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:11,440
(Sung Hoon sits down too.)

1340
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:17,309
(It's becoming weirder and weirder.)

1341
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:20,210
(Sung Hoon dances sitting down.)

1342
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:23,750
(Wait. What is he doing?)

1343
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:28,050
(I'll get going now.)

1344
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:33,590
I'll just give you 10 dollars.

1345
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:36,429
I'll give you.

1346
00:52:36,429 --> 00:52:39,659
- Good. - You were sexy.

1347
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:42,730
Sung Hoon told me in the waiting room,

1348
00:52:42,769 --> 00:52:45,039
"I'm not going to dance."

1349
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:47,539
(I have my reputation.)

1350
00:52:48,369 --> 00:52:49,739
- It was... - He was sexy.

1351
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:52,139
- That was close. - Sung Hoon...

1352
00:52:52,139 --> 00:52:54,409
Seung Un is still in first place.

1353
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:56,719
- Sun Mi. - Sun Mi!

1354
00:52:56,719 --> 00:52:57,719
Sun Mi.

1355
00:52:57,719 --> 00:52:59,750
- Sun Mi. - Come on. Let's get it.

1356
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,320
- She's a difficult one. - She is.

1357
00:53:01,489 --> 00:53:02,949
She's a great dancer.

1358
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:05,059
The queen is here.

1359
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:06,960
Play the music.

1360
00:53:09,789 --> 00:53:10,800
She's different.

1361
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,929
- She's different. - Gosh.

1362
00:53:12,929 --> 00:53:14,199
She wins.

1363
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:15,199
(Her waves are different.)

1364
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:18,199
(Amazed)

1365
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:21,440
(We win.)

1366
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:23,679
(She dances on the grass.)

1367
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:24,940
It gives me goosebumps.

1368
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:25,940
(She dances on the grass.)

1369
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,510
Oh, my.

1370
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:30,119
I can't watch this.

1371
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:31,519
(It's almost shocking.)

1372
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,150
On the grass...

1373
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,349
(She keeps sweeping the grass.)

1374
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:38,460
- Amazing. - Somebody stop her.

1375
00:53:38,619 --> 00:53:39,719
Somebody stop her.

1376
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:42,460
Somebody stop her.

1377
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:44,929
Sun Mi, that's enough.

1378
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,329
That's enough.

1379
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:47,829
(I'm only beginning.)

1380
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:49,230
That's enough.

1381
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:51,239
Hey.

1382
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:53,099
Sun Mi.

1383
00:53:53,139 --> 00:53:55,840
I like to dance, but...

1384
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,239
(Jae Seok is embarrassed.)

1385
00:53:57,239 --> 00:53:58,539
I like to dance, but...

1386
00:53:58,539 --> 00:53:59,739
(She finishes with a mild wave.)

1387
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,380
That's enough. You win 10 dollars.

1388
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,550
We win 10 dollars.

1389
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:04,780
(Sun Mi gave a fabulous performance.)

1390
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:07,219
No one could beat this.

1391
00:54:07,219 --> 00:54:09,119
- First of all... - I acknowledge it.

1392
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,420
- I admit it. - We have to admit it.

1393
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:13,760
Seung Un did a great job,

1394
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,889
but Sun Mi wins. Next is...

1395
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:17,960
Z Young.

1396
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:20,969
Sol Bi, if I'm struggling, you take over.

1397
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:23,800
(I'll do it, but...)

1398
00:54:24,269 --> 00:54:27,309
What?

1399
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,510
Okay?

1400
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,039
You take over.

1401
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:33,210
No one has ever said that.

1402
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:34,780
- You take over. - Okay.

1403
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,579
- Okay? - She wants me to take over.

1404
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,420
She'll be amazing.

1405
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:40,889
Go up.

1406
00:54:40,889 --> 00:54:42,789
- The return of the queen. - The queen.

1407
00:54:42,789 --> 00:54:45,460
Here comes Z Young.

1408
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:49,289
(The sexy diva is ready to dance.)

1409
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:50,530
Hurry, and play the music.

1410
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,429
Play the music.

1411
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:57,070
Good.

1412
00:54:58,739 --> 00:54:59,739
Amazing.

1413
00:54:59,739 --> 00:55:01,940
(She makes use of the pole.)

1414
00:55:02,739 --> 00:55:05,539
(The sexy diva proves her worth.)

1415
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:07,949
- She's different. - She's so experienced.

1416
00:55:07,949 --> 00:55:09,750
(She's different.)

1417
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:13,150
There you go.

1418
00:55:13,219 --> 00:55:15,489
(Mom will win the money, my daughter.)

1419
00:55:15,489 --> 00:55:16,760
That's right.

1420
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,920
- Shake it. - Great.

1421
00:55:18,219 --> 00:55:19,460
Keep going.

1422
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:21,429
(Her back aches.)

1423
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:24,329
You take over.

1424
00:55:24,329 --> 00:55:26,300
Here comes Sol Bi.

1425
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:29,599
Oh, my. Hold on.

1426
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:32,570
(Sol Bi takes over.)

1427
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:35,409
(Her skirt falls off.)

1428
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:40,150
(The shooting comes to a halt.)

1429
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:43,780
It's an accident. I can't believe this.

1430
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:46,650
- Her skirt fell off. - It's an accident.

1431
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:49,150
- I can't believe this. - What happened?

1432
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:50,320
I didn't mean to do that.

1433
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,760
- Hey. - That's not what we meant.

1434
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,059
That's not what we meant by "sexy".

1435
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:54,159
It's not.

1436
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:56,829
You shouldn't take off your clothes.

1437
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:59,860
I'm the winner, right?

1438
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,630
Gosh, I can't believe this.

1439
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:04,000
I could have taken off my pants.

1440
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:05,170
That's enough.

1441
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,239
- Please blur it. - Sol Bi wins.

1442
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:08,309
Right?

1443
00:56:08,309 --> 00:56:10,610
Give her 10 dollars. Give her.

1444
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:12,139
Sun Mi, we can't do anything.

1445
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:15,050
The winner of the sexy dance battle is...

1446
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:16,349
Sol Bi.

1447
00:56:16,349 --> 00:56:18,119
(Seok Jin and Sol Bi win 10 dollars.)

1448
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,719
Now, Kei.

1449
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:22,789
What is her charm?

1450
00:56:22,849 --> 00:56:26,090
- She's... - She's so cute.

1451
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:27,690
That's right.

1452
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:31,199
(Cuteness)

1453
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:35,670
She hasn't done this anywhere else.

1454
00:56:35,769 --> 00:56:37,869
- Kei came up with this... - She came up with it.

1455
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:39,239
Recently.

1456
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:40,869
It's called, "Honey".

1457
00:56:40,869 --> 00:56:42,239
- "Honey"? - "Honey".

1458
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,639
Jong Kook is my honey today.

1459
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:45,880
- Me? - Please help me.

1460
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,250
- Me? - You're my honey today.

1461
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:53,949
(What will Kei do to Jong Kook?)

1462
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,860
- Say, "One, two, three". - Okay.

1463
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,289
One, two, three.

1464
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:03,829
I wanted to see Jong Kook so much.

1465
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:06,300
(Jong Kook can't help but smile.)

1466
00:57:06,969 --> 00:57:10,599
My heart is about to burst to see him.

1467
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:13,409
(The audience can't take it anymore.)

1468
00:57:13,409 --> 00:57:16,880
Give me a kiss on the cheek.

1469
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,610
(Give me a kiss on the cheek.)

1470
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:22,780
Otherwise, I will kiss you.

1471
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:25,750
(Oh, my.)

1472
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:29,119
Honey, my honey

1473
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,659
My love

1474
00:57:31,659 --> 00:57:33,260
She's unbelievable.

1475
00:57:33,929 --> 00:57:36,929
My honey, I love you

1476
00:57:36,929 --> 00:57:38,400
(She never stops.)

1477
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,230
Give her 10 dollars. No one can do that.

1478
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:43,940
(Give her 10 dollars. No one can do that.)

1479
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:46,199
Give her 10 dollars.

1480
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:47,739
I mean it.

1481
00:57:47,739 --> 00:57:49,969
- Just give her. - Who wants to try?

1482
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:51,780
- Who would want to do that? - Don't try.

1483
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,480
Don't do it.

1484
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,309
Don't even try. Kei, you're amazing.

1485
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:57,750
- She's amazing. - I admit it.

1486
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,880
- Unbelievable. - Don't do it.

1487
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,619
My team can't do it.

1488
00:58:02,619 --> 00:58:04,260
- My team will give up too. - I give up.

1489
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:05,590
- I give up. - Sae Ho.

1490
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:07,190
- Sae Ho will try. - Sae Ho?

1491
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:08,190
- Ji Hyo will try. - Sae Ho will try?

1492
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:09,489
- Sae Ho will try. - Okay.

1493
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:10,500
Sae Ho.

1494
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,730
- Be as cute as you can. - But...

1495
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:14,199
I don't want to do it.

1496
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,929
(Come on, Ji Hyo.)

1497
00:58:15,929 --> 00:58:17,969
- Do I have to? - Be as cute as you can.

1498
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:20,469
Don't forget to blink. Do you need my help?

1499
00:58:20,469 --> 00:58:21,639
No.

1500
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:22,710
You're okay?

1501
00:58:22,807 --> 00:58:25,847
(Sae Ho is ready.)

1502
00:58:26,678 --> 00:58:29,018
(Look at him.)

1503
00:58:29,718 --> 00:58:31,017
(Blinking)

1504
00:58:32,517 --> 00:58:36,058
I wanted to see Ji Hyo so much.

1505
00:58:36,058 --> 00:58:38,687
(The girls are looking away.)

1506
00:58:38,687 --> 00:58:40,158
Oh, my.

1507
00:58:40,158 --> 00:58:43,098
He must be sick.

1508
00:58:43,528 --> 00:58:45,567
- My heart is about to burst... - He's sick.

1509
00:58:45,727 --> 00:58:47,837
- He just sounds stupid. - He sounds so weird.

1510
00:58:47,837 --> 00:58:49,308
I know a guy like him.

1511
00:58:49,308 --> 00:58:53,107
- I wanted to sound cute. - It was...

1512
00:58:53,107 --> 00:58:54,377
- You went overboard. - not quite right.

1513
00:58:54,377 --> 00:58:56,107
- You think so? - It was too much.

1514
00:58:56,107 --> 00:58:57,247
- Try again. - Okay.

1515
00:58:58,607 --> 00:59:01,147
I wanted to see Ji Hyo...

1516
00:59:01,417 --> 00:59:04,247
- Wait. - I said I didn't want to do it.

1517
00:59:04,687 --> 00:59:05,817
I said...

1518
00:59:05,817 --> 00:59:07,357
You said...

1519
00:59:07,357 --> 00:59:08,758
you wanted to do it.

1520
00:59:08,758 --> 00:59:11,528
I didn't. Ji Hyo forced me.

1521
00:59:11,528 --> 00:59:14,428
- You said you wanted to try. - I see. Did I?

1522
00:59:14,528 --> 00:59:16,528
Thank you anyway.

1523
00:59:17,028 --> 00:59:20,738
All right. Kei wins.

1524
00:59:21,968 --> 00:59:23,267
We get the money.

1525
00:59:23,607 --> 00:59:24,607
It was obvious.

1526
00:59:25,107 --> 00:59:27,808
It's Sun Mi's turn now.

1527
00:59:27,808 --> 00:59:29,078
(It's Sun Mi's turn.)

1528
00:59:29,477 --> 00:59:32,508
Sun Mi is good at mimicking animals.

1529
00:59:32,647 --> 00:59:36,448
(She's the best at mimicking animals.)

1530
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:37,618
Animal impressions?

1531
00:59:37,747 --> 00:59:39,187
I am sure...

1532
00:59:40,087 --> 00:59:44,028
we will easily win 10 dollars.

1533
00:59:44,028 --> 00:59:45,187
How good is she?

1534
00:59:45,488 --> 00:59:46,758
Which bird will you imitate?

1535
00:59:47,098 --> 00:59:48,727
I will imitate...

1536
00:59:48,727 --> 00:59:49,997
a brown hawk-owl.

1537
00:59:50,267 --> 00:59:51,368
A brown hawk-owl?

1538
00:59:51,368 --> 00:59:52,767
It's not even a common owl.

1539
00:59:52,837 --> 00:59:55,067
I don't know what kind of a sound it makes.

1540
00:59:56,267 --> 00:59:57,937
- It's a real bird. - I know what it is.

1541
00:59:57,937 --> 01:00:01,078
You will recognize the sound upon hearing it.

1542
01:00:01,078 --> 01:00:04,448
She will imitate a brown hawk-owl.

1543
01:00:04,948 --> 01:00:07,377
Please be quiet. Let's hear it.

1544
01:00:10,517 --> 01:00:13,558
(Hooting)

1545
01:00:14,218 --> 01:00:15,357
- I recognize this sound. - It's an owl.

1546
01:00:16,888 --> 01:00:19,558
(It's a bit sloppy.)

1547
01:00:19,558 --> 01:00:20,758
(Glancing around)

1548
01:00:20,758 --> 01:00:21,928
There is more.

1549
01:00:22,397 --> 01:00:23,598
She is good.

1550
01:00:23,968 --> 01:00:26,468
- I can imitate a cuckoo. - A cuckoo. That's good.

1551
01:00:26,598 --> 01:00:28,767
A brown hawk-owl impression wasn't that impressive.

1552
01:00:30,468 --> 01:00:31,538
(Cuckoo)

1553
01:00:32,607 --> 01:00:33,638
(Cuckoo)

1554
01:00:34,778 --> 01:00:35,908
(Cuckoo)

1555
01:00:36,147 --> 01:00:37,678
A bird chirped in response.

1556
01:00:37,678 --> 01:00:39,977
The birds are gathering around.

1557
01:00:41,078 --> 01:00:43,047
(A bird flew in upon hearing the sound.)

1558
01:00:44,547 --> 01:00:45,988
(This is a real situation.)

1559
01:00:45,988 --> 01:00:47,017
Listen.

1560
01:00:47,017 --> 01:00:49,828
- A bird responded. - Keep going.

1561
01:00:49,828 --> 01:00:50,988
Sun Mi, keep going.

1562
01:00:50,988 --> 01:00:52,328
That bird seems to be angry.

1563
01:00:52,328 --> 01:00:55,098
(The queen of communication, Sun Mi)

1564
01:00:55,627 --> 01:00:56,627
(Flying away)

1565
01:00:57,767 --> 01:00:58,767
Hey.

1566
01:00:59,397 --> 01:01:00,738
The birds gathered around.

1567
01:01:00,738 --> 01:01:02,437
(Everyone's shocked.)

1568
01:01:02,437 --> 01:01:03,707
How does she do that?

1569
01:01:04,167 --> 01:01:06,178
Who wants to challenge her?

1570
01:01:06,377 --> 01:01:07,607
- Anyone? - Who wants to challenge her?

1571
01:01:07,607 --> 01:01:09,207
If there isn't anyone, we will take 10 dollars.

1572
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,348
She will imitate a crow.

1573
01:01:10,348 --> 01:01:11,348
(Is Z Young stepping up?)

1574
01:01:11,377 --> 01:01:12,408
A crow.

1575
01:01:12,408 --> 01:01:16,147
(Z Young imitates a crow.)

1576
01:01:16,147 --> 01:01:17,488
I can do better.

1577
01:01:17,488 --> 01:01:18,618
Can you imitate a crow?

1578
01:01:18,618 --> 01:01:22,558
(Can she imitate a crow as well?)

1579
01:01:23,258 --> 01:01:26,528
(Cawing)

1580
01:01:26,658 --> 01:01:28,997
- What was that? Sun Mi. - Sun Mi.

1581
01:01:28,997 --> 01:01:30,828
- Did you really do that? - Gather your wits.

1582
01:01:30,828 --> 01:01:31,828
You have done enough.

1583
01:01:31,828 --> 01:01:34,538
Sun Mi, you have done enough. The cuckoo impression was enough.

1584
01:01:34,937 --> 01:01:36,107
It was enough.

1585
01:01:36,337 --> 01:01:38,207
- She shouldn't try anything else. - That's right.

1586
01:01:38,808 --> 01:01:40,607
Who can imitate a bird? Can you do it?

1587
01:01:42,707 --> 01:01:44,408
- Listen to that. - You heard that, right?

1588
01:01:44,408 --> 01:01:46,218
(Screeching)

1589
01:01:46,218 --> 01:01:47,948
(It's the perfect timing.)

1590
01:01:47,948 --> 01:01:50,388
- You heard that, right? - I did it.

1591
01:01:50,388 --> 01:01:52,218
- Did Elijah make that sound? - Yes, she did.

1592
01:01:52,587 --> 01:01:53,917
- Did Elijah make that sound? - Yes.

1593
01:01:53,917 --> 01:01:55,388
- I did it. - I got goosebumps.

1594
01:01:55,658 --> 01:01:57,357
- It was incredible. - Do it again.

1595
01:01:57,357 --> 01:01:59,058
Do it again, Elijah.

1596
01:01:59,258 --> 01:02:00,828
I need to be in the zone. Wait a minute.

1597
01:02:02,058 --> 01:02:03,928
She needs to be in the zone. How cute!

1598
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:05,098
(Look at her.)

1599
01:02:06,198 --> 01:02:10,868
(Chirping)

1600
01:02:11,508 --> 01:02:13,207
Are you saying you made that sound?

1601
01:02:13,207 --> 01:02:15,538
The timing was perfect.

1602
01:02:15,538 --> 01:02:16,578
- She is an expert. - Seriously?

1603
01:02:16,578 --> 01:02:17,808
She did the perfect bird impression.

1604
01:02:17,977 --> 01:02:19,317
- Did Elijah make that sound? - Yes.

1605
01:02:20,078 --> 01:02:21,817
- I imitated three birds. - Who is next?

1606
01:02:22,047 --> 01:02:23,147
You are good.

1607
01:02:23,788 --> 01:02:24,788
(The truth remains to be found.)

1608
01:02:24,788 --> 01:02:27,017
- Who is next? - I won't imitate a bird...

1609
01:02:27,258 --> 01:02:30,258
but a monkey, gorilla, or an elephant. May I do that?

1610
01:02:30,258 --> 01:02:32,727
- Sure. - It's still an animal.

1611
01:02:32,727 --> 01:02:35,028
As long as you imitate an animal, it's okay.

1612
01:02:35,028 --> 01:02:36,098
Which animal will you imitate first?

1613
01:02:36,098 --> 01:02:38,567
- You know the sound elephants make. - An elephant.

1614
01:02:39,738 --> 01:02:41,067
(Trumpeting)

1615
01:02:41,797 --> 01:02:42,808
(Trumpeting)

1616
01:02:44,138 --> 01:02:45,638
(My goodness.)

1617
01:02:45,638 --> 01:02:47,038
That's incredible.

1618
01:02:48,078 --> 01:02:49,178
(Do you want to hear it again?)

1619
01:02:49,178 --> 01:02:50,278
Let's hear it one more time.

1620
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,647
(Do you want to hear it again?)

1621
01:02:52,547 --> 01:02:53,948
(I am an elephant.)

1622
01:02:53,948 --> 01:02:55,448
It's an elephant.

1623
01:02:55,517 --> 01:02:57,687
(The elephant trumpets proudly.)

1624
01:02:57,687 --> 01:02:58,718
- You sound like an elephant. - That's incredible.

1625
01:02:58,718 --> 01:03:00,488
It gives me a headache.

1626
01:03:01,017 --> 01:03:02,187
I was so surprised.

1627
01:03:03,258 --> 01:03:05,857
(From afar, he looks like an elephant.)

1628
01:03:05,857 --> 01:03:07,497
- Let's see the next one. - A gorilla.

1629
01:03:07,497 --> 01:03:08,558
(Roaring)

1630
01:03:08,558 --> 01:03:10,598
- Wait a minute. - An elephant.

1631
01:03:10,598 --> 01:03:11,727
(Trumpeting)

1632
01:03:12,567 --> 01:03:13,638
An elephant.

1633
01:03:14,567 --> 01:03:15,767
A gorilla.

1634
01:03:16,607 --> 01:03:18,138
Three elephants.

1635
01:03:19,067 --> 01:03:20,337
My goodness.

1636
01:03:20,808 --> 01:03:22,038
He is good.

1637
01:03:22,607 --> 01:03:25,877
(Three elephants appear.)

1638
01:03:26,178 --> 01:03:27,348
He really sounds like an elephant.

1639
01:03:28,178 --> 01:03:29,517
He really sounds like one.

1640
01:03:29,517 --> 01:03:31,618
- Acknowledge his talent. - The sound of an elephant.

1641
01:03:31,988 --> 01:03:34,888
All right. Sae Ho and Sun Mi will have the final match.

1642
01:03:35,417 --> 01:03:38,558
Let's have a match between a cuckoo and an elephant.

1643
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:40,297
Sun Mi, you can't back down.

1644
01:03:40,297 --> 01:03:42,158
The elephant impression was quite impressive.

1645
01:03:42,198 --> 01:03:43,227
All right.

1646
01:03:43,727 --> 01:03:44,868
Run forward.

1647
01:03:45,227 --> 01:03:46,497
(Trumpeting)

1648
01:03:46,497 --> 01:03:49,667
Wait a minute. This elephant...

1649
01:03:50,038 --> 01:03:52,437
- You lost your energy. - Seriously.

1650
01:03:52,778 --> 01:03:54,638
- The sound became much smaller. - You need to give it...

1651
01:03:54,638 --> 01:03:55,707
- your all now. - You did a great job earlier.

1652
01:03:55,707 --> 01:03:56,877
- Sae Ho, drink some water. - You did a great job earlier.

1653
01:03:56,877 --> 01:03:57,977
Drink some water.

1654
01:03:57,977 --> 01:03:59,377
(He lacks the energy after a vigorous warm-up.)

1655
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,848
You really sounded like one earlier.

1656
01:04:01,247 --> 01:04:03,247
- Why can't you do it now? - I think I can imitate an elephant.

1657
01:04:03,247 --> 01:04:04,517
All right.

1658
01:04:04,517 --> 01:04:06,357
- Sun Mi will imitate an elephant. - My goodness.

1659
01:04:06,517 --> 01:04:07,587
A female elephant.

1660
01:04:07,587 --> 01:04:08,817
(Sun Mi attempts to imitate something other than birds.)

1661
01:04:10,028 --> 01:04:12,158
(Trumpeting)

1662
01:04:13,357 --> 01:04:15,328
(My goodness.)

1663
01:04:15,598 --> 01:04:16,627
A cuckoo.

1664
01:04:17,997 --> 01:04:19,468
Her cuckoo impression is incredible.

1665
01:04:20,038 --> 01:04:21,167
Can you imitate a cuckoo?

1666
01:04:21,167 --> 01:04:24,138
(Can Sae Ho imitate a cuckoo?)

1667
01:04:24,138 --> 01:04:25,567
(He makes strange noises.)

1668
01:04:25,977 --> 01:04:27,937
(Is he hiccuping?)

1669
01:04:27,937 --> 01:04:30,008
Sun Mi wins.

1670
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:32,078
What? Is the match over?

1671
01:04:32,377 --> 01:04:34,047
It's over.

1672
01:04:34,218 --> 01:04:35,817
I got 10 dollars.

1673
01:04:35,817 --> 01:04:37,448
(The master of animal impressions, Sun Mi, gets 10 dollars.)

1674
01:04:37,448 --> 01:04:38,618
Sung Hoon.

1675
01:04:38,618 --> 01:04:40,817
I will tell you what Sung Hoon's charm is.

1676
01:04:40,817 --> 01:04:43,258
You can see his wide shoulders, right?

1677
01:04:43,558 --> 01:04:45,957
His charm is the power that comes from them.

1678
01:04:45,957 --> 01:04:49,868
(He is the best at his show of strength.)

1679
01:04:49,868 --> 01:04:51,198
- Shall we arm wrestle? - Shall we arm wrestle?

1680
01:04:51,428 --> 01:04:54,067
- No. King of the Hammer. - King of the Hammer.

1681
01:04:54,067 --> 01:04:55,868
- King of the Hammer. - Really?

1682
01:04:55,868 --> 01:05:02,377
(Is King of the Hammer the game that will verify Sung Hoon's charm?)

1683
01:05:02,377 --> 01:05:04,178
(Let's see if Sung Hoon will take the mission money.)

1684
01:05:04,178 --> 01:05:05,908
- Sung Hoon will go first... - Okay.

1685
01:05:06,247 --> 01:05:08,218
- since he chose the game. - Let's see it.

1686
01:05:08,218 --> 01:05:09,218
Let's see what he can do.

1687
01:05:09,218 --> 01:05:11,747
He lacks strength these days because he is on a diet.

1688
01:05:11,747 --> 01:05:13,017
No practice round, right?

1689
01:05:13,187 --> 01:05:15,258
- There is no practice round. - This is the real round.

1690
01:05:15,258 --> 01:05:16,627
This is the real round.

1691
01:05:16,857 --> 01:05:18,328
(Good luck, Sung Hoon.)

1692
01:05:19,328 --> 01:05:20,627
- It's set. - Is it set?

1693
01:05:20,627 --> 01:05:22,457
- It rose up. - Now...

1694
01:05:22,968 --> 01:05:24,428
Look at his shoulder blades.

1695
01:05:24,667 --> 01:05:26,198
His back is very wide.

1696
01:05:26,238 --> 01:05:27,638
He will show us what he can do.

1697
01:05:28,538 --> 01:05:29,808
I will give it a go.

1698
01:05:30,368 --> 01:05:31,538
You only get one chance.

1699
01:05:31,538 --> 01:05:33,408
(Judging by his shoulders, he will probably win.)

1700
01:05:33,408 --> 01:05:36,278
(Jong Kook looks nervous.)

1701
01:05:39,348 --> 01:05:43,448
(Finally, )

1702
01:05:43,448 --> 01:05:47,718
(he lifts up the hammer.)

1703
01:05:47,718 --> 01:05:51,288
(Hitting)

1704
01:05:52,087 --> 01:05:54,058
- All right. - 5, 6, 7.

1705
01:05:54,058 --> 01:06:00,868
(What is the score of the man with wide shoulders?)

1706
01:06:00,868 --> 01:06:03,968
(He reaches 13 out of 15 stages.)

1707
01:06:04,267 --> 01:06:05,808
- 13. - 13.

1708
01:06:05,808 --> 01:06:06,937
13.

1709
01:06:07,477 --> 01:06:09,908
Are you okay? Don't your hands hurt?

1710
01:06:10,607 --> 01:06:13,078
He reached the 13th stage.

1711
01:06:13,618 --> 01:06:15,848
His score is 865.

1712
01:06:15,848 --> 01:06:16,988
- 865. - Up next...

1713
01:06:16,988 --> 01:06:18,587
- is Kwang Soo. - Okay.

1714
01:06:18,587 --> 01:06:19,587
I am excited.

1715
01:06:19,587 --> 01:06:21,388
- The current score is 865. - Right.

1716
01:06:21,558 --> 01:06:22,828
I heard that he was a gunner in the army.

1717
01:06:22,828 --> 01:06:24,587
I hammered in the army for a year.

1718
01:06:24,587 --> 01:06:27,558
I can't wait to see his score.

1719
01:06:27,558 --> 01:06:29,567
For some reason, he looks cool today.

1720
01:06:30,727 --> 01:06:31,767
All right.

1721
01:06:32,127 --> 01:06:33,198
You look cool.

1722
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:34,337
(Pausing)

1723
01:06:35,038 --> 01:06:37,408
- Did you smile in this direction? - For goodness' sake.

1724
01:06:37,667 --> 01:06:40,107
- I heard, "You look cool." - Someone said you looked cool.

1725
01:06:40,107 --> 01:06:42,238
I heard it from somewhere.

1726
01:06:42,607 --> 01:06:43,747
I am serious.

1727
01:06:44,308 --> 01:06:45,477
I will do this with seriousness.

1728
01:06:45,847 --> 01:06:49,488
He was a gunner in the army.

1729
01:06:49,488 --> 01:06:51,288
A gunner must have hammered a lot of stakes into the ground.

1730
01:06:51,288 --> 01:06:52,988
This is a matter of pride.

1731
01:06:53,257 --> 01:06:54,257
I will give it a go.

1732
01:06:54,257 --> 01:06:55,557
(He is determined to win.)

1733
01:06:57,227 --> 01:06:58,687
(Missing)

1734
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,698
My goodness.

1735
01:07:01,528 --> 01:07:03,498
(You are ridiculous.)

1736
01:07:03,498 --> 01:07:04,628
You are ridiculous.

1737
01:07:04,628 --> 01:07:06,637
I will try again right away.

1738
01:07:06,637 --> 01:07:09,038
- Don't turn it into a comedy skit. - I will try again right away.

1739
01:07:09,137 --> 01:07:10,767
- I am serious. - Stop it.

1740
01:07:10,767 --> 01:07:12,637
- Here I go. - He shouldn't get a second chance.

1741
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:15,437
- I was so surprised. - This isn't a comedy skit.

1742
01:07:15,778 --> 01:07:17,578
- What is going on? - Hey.

1743
01:07:17,748 --> 01:07:18,807
No one does that at "Comedy Big League", right?

1744
01:07:18,807 --> 01:07:20,177
- No one does. - Here I go.

1745
01:07:20,347 --> 01:07:22,748
A comedy skit like this one will get you eliminated.

1746
01:07:22,748 --> 01:07:23,748
Here I go.

1747
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:26,288
(Kwang Soo tries for the 2nd time.)

1748
01:07:28,017 --> 01:07:29,017
(Hitting)

1749
01:07:29,017 --> 01:07:30,057
(He slipped.)

1750
01:07:30,057 --> 01:07:31,357
You slipped a little.

1751
01:07:32,128 --> 01:07:34,057
(He loses with a score of 817.)

1752
01:07:34,057 --> 01:07:35,528
You slipped a little.

1753
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:39,467
You aren't a man.

1754
01:07:39,467 --> 01:07:40,767
(What did you say?)

1755
01:07:41,738 --> 01:07:44,708
- Se Chan is strong. - He is a dark horse.

1756
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:46,507
(They aren't aware of the aftermath this match will bring.)

1757
01:07:48,838 --> 01:07:51,147
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

1758
01:07:51,408 --> 01:07:53,118
Seung Un, would you take a picture for us?

1759
01:07:53,118 --> 01:07:54,977
- A picture? Okay. - Yes.

1760
01:07:54,977 --> 01:07:56,588
- It's for memories. - Yes.

1761
01:07:56,918 --> 01:07:58,948
- Let me get a close-up shot. - Are you ready?

1762
01:07:59,088 --> 01:08:00,488
- I will get a close-up shot. - Okay.

1763
01:08:01,387 --> 01:08:03,387
In 1, 2, 3.

1764
01:08:03,387 --> 01:08:04,958
(They ask Seung Un to take pictures for them.)

1765
01:08:05,227 --> 01:08:07,227
In 1, 2, 3. In 1, 2, 3.

1766
01:08:08,128 --> 01:08:09,597
- Here you go. - Thank you.

1767
01:08:09,597 --> 01:08:11,798
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1768
01:08:11,998 --> 01:08:14,397
- She took good pictures. - She really did.

1769
01:08:14,567 --> 01:08:16,507
- I like this one. - The image quality is great.

1770
01:08:18,538 --> 01:08:20,778
What is this? Isn't that Kwang Soo?

1771
01:08:22,278 --> 01:08:23,548
Kwang Soo.

1772
01:08:23,548 --> 01:08:26,177
(Kwang Soo is watching them.)

1773
01:08:26,778 --> 01:08:30,488
(Kwang Soo has always suffered because of Se Chan.)

1774
01:08:30,488 --> 01:08:32,517
(Kwang Soo is out for revenge.)

1775
01:08:32,918 --> 01:08:35,357
(What is the ending of this drama?)

1776
01:08:35,717 --> 01:08:37,857
Up next is Jong Kook.

1777
01:08:37,857 --> 01:08:39,227
- Let's go. - Jong Kook.

1778
01:08:39,528 --> 01:08:41,158
- My goodness. - Jong Kook, show them.

1779
01:08:41,927 --> 01:08:44,998
(I am Thor.)

1780
01:08:44,998 --> 01:08:48,538
(Who is stronger, Sung Hoon or Jong Kook?)

1781
01:08:48,538 --> 01:08:50,067
- He is Thor. - Seriously.

1782
01:08:50,067 --> 01:08:51,937
This is the final round.

1783
01:08:51,937 --> 01:08:53,607
- Please. - Let's go.

1784
01:08:53,607 --> 01:08:55,778
- Please. - He is Thor.

1785
01:08:55,908 --> 01:08:56,977
- Here I go. - Let's go.

1786
01:08:57,347 --> 01:08:59,048
Here I go.

1787
01:09:02,887 --> 01:09:07,118
(He hits the target at full power.)

1788
01:09:07,118 --> 01:09:08,618
(Let me show you the strength of a tiger.)

1789
01:09:08,618 --> 01:09:10,458
- This is the final round. - Please.

1790
01:09:12,028 --> 01:09:14,427
He exceeded the previous score.

1791
01:09:14,427 --> 01:09:19,897
(Can Jong Kook's score beat Sung Hoon's?)

1792
01:09:24,338 --> 01:09:28,807
(It's close.)

1793
01:09:29,307 --> 01:09:32,007
- That was close. - That was really close.

1794
01:09:32,748 --> 01:09:34,517
That was so close. You were awesome.

1795
01:09:34,517 --> 01:09:36,387
- In the end, - It's not possible.

1796
01:09:36,387 --> 01:09:39,217
- Sung Hoon wins with 865 points. - That was awesome.

1797
01:09:39,817 --> 01:09:42,727
(Mission money statistics)

1798
01:09:42,727 --> 01:09:46,397
So that concludes What's Your Charm?

1799
01:09:46,628 --> 01:09:48,798
We'll get started with the missions for today.

1800
01:09:49,128 --> 01:09:53,397
This is Half and Half Project Part 3: Public Enemy Race.

1801
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:54,767
(Half and Half Project Part 3: Public Enemy Race)

1802
01:09:54,767 --> 01:09:57,668
(Public Enemy Race?)

1803
01:09:58,507 --> 01:10:00,278
Each week, missions were conducted...

1804
01:10:00,278 --> 01:10:03,007
with travel destinations recommended by Running Man members and staff.

1805
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:05,908
When Running Man members win, they get to recommend places.

1806
01:10:05,908 --> 01:10:10,048
When the staff wins, we get to put places on the roulette.

1807
01:10:10,048 --> 01:10:12,187
(Their fate depends on the roulette.)

1808
01:10:13,257 --> 01:10:15,317
(The unlucky Jae Seok was picked...)

1809
01:10:15,317 --> 01:10:17,187
(to go to New Zealand's Nevis Swing.)

1810
01:10:17,988 --> 01:10:21,958
(So Min was picked to go to Polynesia's Bora Bora...)

1811
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:24,967
(that the members recommended.)

1812
01:10:24,967 --> 01:10:27,137
(Which destination will make it to the roulette today?)

1813
01:10:27,137 --> 01:10:30,637
This is Half and Half Project Part 3: Public Enemy Race.

1814
01:10:30,637 --> 01:10:34,977
Each couple picks 2 balls from a box that contains 16 balls.

1815
01:10:35,708 --> 01:10:39,317
Written on the balls are the 14 travel destinations,

1816
01:10:39,618 --> 01:10:43,317
1 ball that says "times by 2" and another that says "divided by 2".

1817
01:10:43,488 --> 01:10:45,088
"Times by 2" and "divided by 2"?

1818
01:10:45,088 --> 01:10:46,217
(Each couple gets to pick 2 balls at random.)

1819
01:10:47,317 --> 01:10:49,057
The winner for each round is...

1820
01:10:49,057 --> 01:10:52,128
the couple that has the most mission money at the end of the race.

1821
01:10:52,328 --> 01:10:54,357
The final destination that goes on the roulette...

1822
01:10:54,357 --> 01:10:57,467
is on the ball that the winners chose.

1823
01:10:58,698 --> 01:11:03,637
(It all depends on the winning team.)

1824
01:11:04,067 --> 01:11:07,007
(Which place will get added during the Public Enemy Race?)

1825
01:11:07,307 --> 01:11:09,448
Moreover, the winning couple can buy names on the roulette...

1826
01:11:09,448 --> 01:11:11,347
with the earned mission money,

1827
01:11:11,548 --> 01:11:16,988
and the guest on the winning team gets a huge reward.

1828
01:11:17,387 --> 01:11:18,748
A huge reward?

1829
01:11:19,147 --> 01:11:22,057
Before we get started with the race, let's pick the balls.

1830
01:11:22,187 --> 01:11:24,187
The guests will come forward on behalf of each couple...

1831
01:11:24,528 --> 01:11:27,257
- and pick two ball on the table. - All right.

1832
01:11:27,257 --> 01:11:28,828
(The 2 balls will have destinations, plus something about the money.)

1833
01:11:28,828 --> 01:11:31,597
(They start picking the balls.)

1834
01:11:31,597 --> 01:11:34,097
(Contemplating)

1835
01:11:34,097 --> 01:11:35,498
(She's not confident.)

1836
01:11:36,467 --> 01:11:38,038
(Their hands...)

1837
01:11:38,038 --> 01:11:41,107
(will change their partner's fate.)

1838
01:11:41,107 --> 01:11:45,378
Each couple can now check what's inside the balls.

1839
01:11:45,477 --> 01:11:47,817
If it's something bad, do you have to go there?

1840
01:11:47,817 --> 01:11:49,048
That's right.

1841
01:11:50,647 --> 01:11:51,948
What's this?

1842
01:11:52,217 --> 01:11:53,687
It has a country on it.

1843
01:11:54,217 --> 01:11:55,757
- Really? - Yes.

1844
01:11:55,757 --> 01:11:57,788
- This. - It's a good place.

1845
01:11:57,788 --> 01:11:58,857
It's good?

1846
01:11:59,158 --> 01:12:00,528
(It's So Min's recommendation.)

1847
01:12:00,528 --> 01:12:05,528
(Krabi is a beautiful island in Thailand.)

1848
01:12:07,097 --> 01:12:09,467
(This is a good start.)

1849
01:12:11,937 --> 01:12:13,637
(Oh, dear.)

1850
01:12:13,637 --> 01:12:14,708
What's that?

1851
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:16,248
(What's this?)

1852
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:19,078
(Brazil's Insano Water Slide)

1853
01:12:19,078 --> 01:12:20,078
(It's the staff's recommendation.)

1854
01:12:20,078 --> 01:12:24,517
(You get to experience the thrill of Brazil's Insano Water Slide.)

1855
01:12:25,687 --> 01:12:27,988
(Is this real?)

1856
01:12:29,788 --> 01:12:30,958
Please.

1857
01:12:31,387 --> 01:12:32,757
What is it?

1858
01:12:33,528 --> 01:12:37,698
(Indonesia's Mount Bromo-Ijen)

1859
01:12:37,698 --> 01:12:42,038
(Welcome to your first ever active volcano.)

1860
01:12:42,038 --> 01:12:46,137
(Mount Bromo-Ijen is an extreme tour.)

1861
01:12:46,137 --> 01:12:47,137
(It's the staff's recommendation.)

1862
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:48,977
(Why did it have to be this?)

1863
01:12:48,977 --> 01:12:51,007
My goodness.

1864
01:12:51,007 --> 01:12:52,878
(They have one ball left.)

1865
01:12:52,878 --> 01:12:55,778
(This has to be good.)

1866
01:12:56,887 --> 01:12:58,847
(They need to halve their mission money?)

1867
01:12:59,418 --> 01:13:01,017
It's okay.

1868
01:13:01,017 --> 01:13:03,088
(If they don't switch their balls, they get half of the mission money.)

1869
01:13:03,088 --> 01:13:06,227
(The class of the unlucky member is not breakable.)

1870
01:13:06,227 --> 01:13:07,427
It's okay.

1871
01:13:07,927 --> 01:13:10,628
- I'm not good at things like this. - What is it?

1872
01:13:10,628 --> 01:13:12,028
(The unlucky Kwang Soo checks his balls as well.)

1873
01:13:12,028 --> 01:13:14,998
(How did I get this?)

1874
01:13:14,998 --> 01:13:16,567
(He gets to double...)

1875
01:13:16,567 --> 01:13:17,868
(his mission money.)

1876
01:13:18,908 --> 01:13:21,208
- Is that the best option? - It is.

1877
01:13:23,007 --> 01:13:25,977
(All 8 couples check their balls.)

1878
01:13:27,948 --> 01:13:29,887
Let's take a picture together.

1879
01:13:30,788 --> 01:13:32,588
In 1, 2, 3.

1880
01:13:34,057 --> 01:13:35,158
(Please let every day be like today.)

1881
01:13:35,158 --> 01:13:36,588
(I'm a lady too.)

1882
01:13:37,387 --> 01:13:40,427
(Haha makes something for So Min.)

1883
01:13:40,427 --> 01:13:41,828
The colors are so nice.

1884
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:43,668
Okay.

1885
01:13:43,668 --> 01:13:45,128
(This is a present for you.)

1886
01:13:45,128 --> 01:13:47,238
I got it.

1887
01:13:47,838 --> 01:13:49,137
- You got it. - My gosh.

1888
01:13:49,137 --> 01:13:50,668
- What's this? - Is this what you meant?

1889
01:13:50,868 --> 01:13:51,908
It's on the picture too.

1890
01:13:51,908 --> 01:13:54,107
(I'll treat you to lunch, Haha.)

1891
01:13:54,107 --> 01:13:56,107
It's cute. Do it for Z Young too.

1892
01:13:56,677 --> 01:13:58,378
- It's nice. - Here too.

1893
01:13:58,778 --> 01:14:00,878
- I got it. - What's that?

1894
01:14:00,878 --> 01:14:01,918
(Here's a gift.)

1895
01:14:01,918 --> 01:14:03,448
You can do it on the pictures too.

1896
01:14:03,817 --> 01:14:06,217
(This is the beauty of couple races.)

1897
01:14:07,158 --> 01:14:09,158
(What are you doing, Sae Ho?)

1898
01:14:09,158 --> 01:14:11,088
- It looks like an ID photo. - Why?

1899
01:14:11,088 --> 01:14:12,557
- You are standing like this. - Am I?

1900
01:14:12,557 --> 01:14:13,958
Look there.

1901
01:14:13,958 --> 01:14:15,528
(Who takes pictures with their arms by their sides?)

1902
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:18,328
It looks like an ID photo.

1903
01:14:18,467 --> 01:14:20,597
- Does it look okay? - It's an ID photo.

1904
01:14:21,368 --> 01:14:22,467
(This is not "Reply 1998".)

1905
01:14:22,467 --> 01:14:23,738
(His stiff neck muscle is the problem.)

1906
01:14:23,738 --> 01:14:25,137
- Do this. - Press this.

1907
01:14:25,137 --> 01:14:27,977
(She tries to make it better.)

1908
01:14:28,538 --> 01:14:29,778
(Sae Ho has a way of making pictures look like ID photos.)

1909
01:14:29,778 --> 01:14:31,408
- The background faded out. - It looks good.

1910
01:14:31,677 --> 01:14:33,578
It looks like you're in a foreign place.

1911
01:14:33,578 --> 01:14:35,317
(It just looks like an ID photo. He must be contestant number 1.)

1912
01:14:35,817 --> 01:14:36,887
This looks good.

1913
01:14:36,887 --> 01:14:39,187
The next location is a restaurant.

1914
01:14:39,187 --> 01:14:41,257
There are menus in the two cars.

1915
01:14:41,257 --> 01:14:44,528
Each car will take four teams. It's first come, first serve.

1916
01:14:45,187 --> 01:14:46,857
(It's either Korean table d'hote or samgyetang.)

1917
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:50,227
(What will the members pick?)

1918
01:14:50,227 --> 01:14:51,528
Hurry up, Sun Mi.

1919
01:14:51,998 --> 01:14:54,238
- Sun Mi. - Hurry, Sol Bi.

1920
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:55,767
Where do we go?

1921
01:14:55,767 --> 01:14:57,107
(They run, thinking this may be a mission.)

1922
01:14:57,107 --> 01:14:58,668
Where is it?

1923
01:14:58,668 --> 01:15:00,977
- Seung Un. - I'm coming.

1924
01:15:01,378 --> 01:15:04,147
- This is Korean table d'hote. - Sun Mi.

1925
01:15:04,147 --> 01:15:05,607
It's Korean table d'hote.

1926
01:15:05,677 --> 01:15:07,048
Sun Mi.

1927
01:15:07,248 --> 01:15:10,248
Sun Mi. It's Korean table d'hote.

1928
01:15:10,248 --> 01:15:12,118
- Move. - Go in.

1929
01:15:12,288 --> 01:15:14,488
Sun Mi. Hurry.

1930
01:15:14,488 --> 01:15:16,328
- Can we all get on? - Jae Seok.

1931
01:15:16,328 --> 01:15:17,887
Hurry, Sun Mi.

1932
01:15:18,057 --> 01:15:20,028
Hurry. Sun Mi.

1933
01:15:20,028 --> 01:15:22,397
This is Korean table d'hote, Jong Kook.

1934
01:15:22,397 --> 01:15:23,767
Jong Kook.

1935
01:15:23,767 --> 01:15:26,368
Hurry, Sun Mi. Where are you?

1936
01:15:26,368 --> 01:15:28,137
You can't do that.

1937
01:15:28,137 --> 01:15:30,107
Hurry, Sun Mi.

1938
01:15:30,307 --> 01:15:31,507
Wait, Jae Seok.

1939
01:15:31,607 --> 01:15:33,238
We have to go to the other car.

1940
01:15:33,507 --> 01:15:34,807
- Just go. - It's samgyetang.

1941
01:15:35,878 --> 01:15:38,147
Today's a good day for Korean table d'hote,

1942
01:15:38,378 --> 01:15:40,017
not samgyetang.

1943
01:15:40,217 --> 01:15:41,977
(They're disappointed.)

1944
01:15:41,977 --> 01:15:43,788
Everybody went to the other car.

1945
01:15:43,918 --> 01:15:46,288
This is a good day for stew and Korean table d'hote.

1946
01:15:46,288 --> 01:15:47,958
Look here.

1947
01:15:48,017 --> 01:15:51,628
These are all the teams with no mission money.

1948
01:15:51,628 --> 01:15:53,427
We're all so poor.

1949
01:15:53,427 --> 01:15:55,227
We're the poor ones.

1950
01:15:55,967 --> 01:15:58,498
- We still have many chances, right? - No.

1951
01:15:58,498 --> 01:15:59,838
- No? - No.

1952
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:02,198
- We eat and go home. - Really?

1953
01:16:02,198 --> 01:16:03,708
(I just warmed up, and it's almost over?)

1954
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:05,137
- We're done. - Really?

1955
01:16:05,137 --> 01:16:07,038
I didn't do much today.

1956
01:16:07,038 --> 01:16:08,278
(He feels bad.)

1957
01:16:08,278 --> 01:16:10,208
- You did a lot. - Did I?

1958
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:12,408
I don't think I'm having a good day.

1959
01:16:12,408 --> 01:16:14,878
- I don't think you are. - You can tell?

1960
01:16:15,217 --> 01:16:17,248
- Wasn't I funny? - In which parts?

1961
01:16:17,387 --> 01:16:20,488
You know, this and that. I did a variety of things.

1962
01:16:20,488 --> 01:16:24,387
- You barely made it on TV. - Is that so?

1963
01:16:25,488 --> 01:16:28,227
You can gather the tiny bits.

1964
01:16:28,958 --> 01:16:31,467
We should have gotten Korean table d'hote.

1965
01:16:32,298 --> 01:16:33,937
(Let me see.)

1966
01:16:33,937 --> 01:16:35,498
- Hey. - Yes?

1967
01:16:37,168 --> 01:16:39,738
We can switch it.

1968
01:16:41,208 --> 01:16:43,908
We can switch the signs in the front.

1969
01:16:43,908 --> 01:16:45,847
(They can change the destinations and head to Korean table d'hote?)

1970
01:16:45,847 --> 01:16:47,378
I'll go in the front.

1971
01:16:47,378 --> 01:16:48,677
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo think of a trick.)

1972
01:16:48,677 --> 01:16:50,488
Let's go, Kwang Soo.

1973
01:16:50,588 --> 01:16:51,918
Will it work?

1974
01:16:54,458 --> 01:16:56,488
(He tries to get in without the other team noticing.)

1975
01:16:56,488 --> 01:16:57,958
Move over.

1976
01:16:59,257 --> 01:17:00,458
(He gets in...)

1977
01:17:00,458 --> 01:17:01,798
(and switches the destinations.)

1978
01:17:01,798 --> 01:17:03,897
Sir, can you switch these?

1979
01:17:06,338 --> 01:17:08,868
(They haven't noticed at all.)

1980
01:17:10,107 --> 01:17:14,038
(They show great teamwork.)

1981
01:17:14,038 --> 01:17:16,007
(The bus going to Korean table d'hote...)

1982
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:18,748
(becomes a bus going to samgyetang.)

1983
01:17:18,748 --> 01:17:22,378
(Kwang Soo changes the signs at the back too.)

1984
01:17:23,387 --> 01:17:24,948
(Sir, please put this on for us.)

1985
01:17:24,948 --> 01:17:26,017
Did you change it, Jae Seok?

1986
01:17:26,017 --> 01:17:27,788
- I did. - Give him a round of applause.

1987
01:17:28,118 --> 01:17:29,628
- You're the best. - Hey.

1988
01:17:29,658 --> 01:17:31,257
- Why didn't we... - That's right.

1989
01:17:31,257 --> 01:17:34,257
Think of this before?

1990
01:17:34,257 --> 01:17:35,257
(Will it be a success?)

1991
01:17:36,028 --> 01:17:39,298
(Jae Seok and Jong Kook's buses are switched.)

1992
01:17:39,368 --> 01:17:40,838
Let's get started.

1993
01:17:41,168 --> 01:17:43,437
Samgyetang is also a Korean table d'hote menu.

1994
01:17:43,437 --> 01:17:44,637
- Of course. - It is.

1995
01:17:45,107 --> 01:17:46,878
Right now,

1996
01:17:47,607 --> 01:17:49,347
the other bus has left.

1997
01:17:49,347 --> 01:17:52,477
Jae Seok, who was on the other bus,

1998
01:17:52,677 --> 01:17:55,548
changed the menu, so we're on our way to the samgyetang place.

1999
01:17:55,647 --> 01:17:57,347
(We're going to...)

2000
01:17:57,347 --> 01:17:59,088
(have...)

2001
01:17:59,088 --> 01:18:00,257
(samgyetang?)

2002
01:18:00,257 --> 01:18:01,988
- Why? - How does that make sense?

2003
01:18:02,387 --> 01:18:03,458
(They all complain.)

2004
01:18:03,458 --> 01:18:05,028
- Did he rip ours? - He ripped them...

2005
01:18:05,028 --> 01:18:06,658
and switched them before leaving.

2006
01:18:06,658 --> 01:18:09,198
That's not right.

2007
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:12,227
This is not right. He can't rip it.

2008
01:18:12,397 --> 01:18:13,967
Let me call him.

2009
01:18:13,967 --> 01:18:15,338
(Let's hear what he has to say.)

2010
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:17,668
Hello?

2011
01:18:17,668 --> 01:18:19,738
- Jae Seok? - Yes.

2012
01:18:19,738 --> 01:18:21,338
It's Jong Kook.

2013
01:18:21,437 --> 01:18:22,748
(Why did Jong Kook...)

2014
01:18:22,748 --> 01:18:23,807
(call?)

2015
01:18:23,807 --> 01:18:25,807
Yes, I know. I recognize your voice.

2016
01:18:25,977 --> 01:18:29,387
I guess you're having Korean table d'hote.

2017
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:31,248
(Why...)

2018
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:33,118
(do you get to go there?)

2019
01:18:33,118 --> 01:18:35,988
- Yes, we... - We got on the right bus.

2020
01:18:35,988 --> 01:18:37,588
We got on the bus.

2021
01:18:37,788 --> 01:18:39,557
- Jae Seok? - Yes.

2022
01:18:39,828 --> 01:18:42,227
You'll be on the Korean table d'hote menu.

2023
01:18:42,227 --> 01:18:44,397
(You'll be on the Korean table d'hote menu.)

2024
01:18:44,698 --> 01:18:47,437
(Stir-fried grasshopper will be on the menu.)

2025
01:18:47,437 --> 01:18:48,767
What did he say?

2026
01:18:48,767 --> 01:18:50,507
- He'll be on the menu? - What?

2027
01:18:50,767 --> 01:18:52,168
Jae Seok is a dish?

2028
01:18:52,368 --> 01:18:54,307
I'm sorry, but we...

2029
01:18:54,307 --> 01:18:56,107
If you're sorry, why did you do that?

2030
01:18:56,107 --> 01:18:57,977
What did we do again?

2031
01:18:58,177 --> 01:19:02,887
You better gather some people.

2032
01:19:02,887 --> 01:19:06,088
(Why do we have to...)

2033
01:19:06,088 --> 01:19:08,017
(gather some people?)

2034
01:19:08,658 --> 01:19:12,998
We're on our way to tear the Korean table d'hote place down.

2035
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:16,328
- You're going to tear it down? - We don't want samgyetang.

2036
01:19:16,828 --> 01:19:18,467
We'll see you at there then.

2037
01:19:18,467 --> 01:19:20,597
Okay. That sounds good.

2038
01:19:20,597 --> 01:19:22,397
- That's a way. - Come at us.

2039
01:19:22,397 --> 01:19:26,278
Only the people who survive at the restaurant get to eat.

2040
01:19:26,278 --> 01:19:27,977
- We'll see you there. - Got it?

2041
01:19:28,177 --> 01:19:30,908
Let's do this until the end. Let's get it.

2042
01:19:31,878 --> 01:19:33,977
Sir?

2043
01:19:34,248 --> 01:19:36,147
(This is Jae Seok's idea in the first place.)

2044
01:19:36,147 --> 01:19:38,517
(This is his final decision.)

2045
01:19:38,517 --> 01:19:39,557
Sir?

2046
01:19:39,958 --> 01:19:43,158
Please go to the samgyetang place.

2047
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:45,458
Why? Don't do that.

2048
01:19:45,528 --> 01:19:46,798
Why samgyetang?

2049
01:19:46,897 --> 01:19:48,727
- No... - I actually like samgyetang.

2050
01:19:48,727 --> 01:19:50,028
- Me too. - I'm serious.

2051
01:19:50,168 --> 01:19:52,368
I think...

2052
01:19:52,397 --> 01:19:54,397
Jae Seok should gather up some courage...

2053
01:19:54,467 --> 01:19:56,007
and head for Korean table d'hote.

2054
01:19:56,007 --> 01:19:57,137
(Jae Seok, )

2055
01:19:57,137 --> 01:19:58,607
(we believe...)

2056
01:19:58,607 --> 01:20:01,607
(in you.)

2057
01:20:01,607 --> 01:20:05,647
Okay, then let's go for Korean table d'hote.

2058
01:20:05,647 --> 01:20:07,248
Let's do that.

2059
01:20:07,248 --> 01:20:08,618
(They all decide to go.)

2060
01:20:08,618 --> 01:20:10,118
Why did they get on the bus going to samgyetang?

2061
01:20:10,118 --> 01:20:11,118
Exactly.

2062
01:20:12,347 --> 01:20:14,817
This won't do.

2063
01:20:14,857 --> 01:20:16,288
This upsets me.

2064
01:20:16,288 --> 01:20:18,158
- Me too. - I don't eat chicken.

2065
01:20:18,158 --> 01:20:21,298
Z Young says she doesn't eat chicken. She's pregnant.

2066
01:20:21,298 --> 01:20:23,668
(She's pregnant.)

2067
01:20:23,668 --> 01:20:26,397
- I'm not pregnant. - Oh, right.

2068
01:20:26,397 --> 01:20:27,467
I'm sorry.

2069
01:20:27,467 --> 01:20:29,838
- She's not pregnant. - Why would you say that?

2070
01:20:29,838 --> 01:20:31,637
- She doing postpartum care. - Right.

2071
01:20:31,637 --> 01:20:33,437
Samgyetang might be really good.

2072
01:20:33,437 --> 01:20:34,878
That's right.

2073
01:20:35,137 --> 01:20:37,048
We'll have a mission on the bus...

2074
01:20:37,248 --> 01:20:39,147
with chances of winning additional mission money.

2075
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:42,548
This mission is called Color Cham, Cham, Cham.

2076
01:20:42,548 --> 01:20:44,918
(Color Cham, Cham, Cham)

2077
01:20:45,748 --> 01:20:46,918
What is that?

2078
01:20:47,187 --> 01:20:50,088
It starts with the coloring book...

2079
01:20:50,988 --> 01:20:53,557
on the phones you were given.

2080
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:54,628
(It's a coloring game.)

2081
01:20:55,028 --> 01:20:56,427
Press the icon that says, "coloring".

2082
01:20:56,467 --> 01:20:58,727
- "Coloring". - Please select...

2083
01:20:59,097 --> 01:21:01,397
- the cherry picture. - Cherry?

2084
01:21:01,397 --> 01:21:04,807
Yes. You can fill the cherries...

2085
01:21:04,807 --> 01:21:08,378
with any two colors you want from the colors above.

2086
01:21:08,378 --> 01:21:10,748
If you select the colors different from mine, you win.

2087
01:21:10,748 --> 01:21:12,748
- Different from yours? - It has to be different.

2088
01:21:12,748 --> 01:21:14,817
The one couple that survives wins five dollars.

2089
01:21:14,817 --> 01:21:16,347
(Only 1 couple wins 5 dollars.)

2090
01:21:16,347 --> 01:21:18,147
(We need that 5 dollars.)

2091
01:21:18,788 --> 01:21:21,918
All right. Please pick your colors for the cherries.

2092
01:21:21,918 --> 01:21:23,028
That looks good.

2093
01:21:23,158 --> 01:21:25,057
We'll do these two.

2094
01:21:25,057 --> 01:21:26,897
(Staff picks green and yellow.)

2095
01:21:26,958 --> 01:21:28,927
(They have to pick different colors from the staff to win.)

2096
01:21:28,927 --> 01:21:31,368
- Which colors should we pick? - Whatever you want.

2097
01:21:31,368 --> 01:21:32,767
- I'll reveal mine. - Okay.

2098
01:21:32,967 --> 01:21:36,368
- In 1, 2, 3. - Please.

2099
01:21:36,607 --> 01:21:40,238
(Please don't be the same.)

2100
01:21:40,708 --> 01:21:41,708
Three.

2101
01:21:42,107 --> 01:21:43,878
(He reveals the result.)

2102
01:21:44,347 --> 01:21:46,048
- Let me see yours. - Yes.

2103
01:21:46,048 --> 01:21:47,278
(Ji Hyo and Sae Ho are out.)

2104
01:21:47,278 --> 01:21:49,817
If you have yellow or green, you're out.

2105
01:21:49,817 --> 01:21:51,248
- I have yellow. - Me too.

2106
01:21:51,248 --> 01:21:52,248
We're safe.

2107
01:21:52,248 --> 01:21:54,717
(Kwang Soo and Seung Un are out.)

2108
01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:56,757
(Jae Seok and Sun Mi pass.)

2109
01:21:56,757 --> 01:21:58,088
Let me see yours.

2110
01:21:58,088 --> 01:21:59,158
(They picked purple and blue.)

2111
01:21:59,458 --> 01:22:00,658
- Let me see yours. - Okay.

2112
01:22:00,757 --> 01:22:02,198
You're all out...

2113
01:22:02,198 --> 01:22:04,927
except Jae Seok and Sun Mi.

2114
01:22:04,927 --> 01:22:06,567
(Jae Seok and Sun Mi win 5 dollars.)

2115
01:22:07,267 --> 01:22:08,298
Thank you.

2116
01:22:08,538 --> 01:22:10,007
- We're first place. - They have a lot of money already.

2117
01:22:10,007 --> 01:22:11,738
- Thank you, Sung Hoon. - They're rich.

2118
01:22:12,007 --> 01:22:13,238
You two are so sweet.

2119
01:22:13,238 --> 01:22:14,437
(Is this the So Min we know?)

2120
01:22:14,437 --> 01:22:15,807
Right, So Min.

2121
01:22:15,908 --> 01:22:18,007
- So Min's eyes are so sweet. - She looks so happy.

2122
01:22:18,007 --> 01:22:20,278
I've never earned so much money on Running Man before.

2123
01:22:20,278 --> 01:22:21,618
- Really? - Yes.

2124
01:22:22,217 --> 01:22:24,187
You don't have to press it.

2125
01:22:24,187 --> 01:22:27,017
(He's warm unlike the other guys on Running Man.)

2126
01:22:27,918 --> 01:22:28,918
(She draws a heart.)

2127
01:22:28,918 --> 01:22:31,128
Why are you drawing a heart?

2128
01:22:31,128 --> 01:22:32,158
It's love.

2129
01:22:32,557 --> 01:22:34,658
She's so lady-like.

2130
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:35,658
(I want to be a lady today.)

2131
01:22:35,658 --> 01:22:36,767
Congratulations.

2132
01:22:36,767 --> 01:22:38,168
Thank you.

2133
01:22:38,168 --> 01:22:40,397
- We're first place. - They have a lot of money already.

2134
01:22:41,038 --> 01:22:42,637
This is our official game on the road.

2135
01:22:42,868 --> 01:22:45,038
- Let's play... - All right.

2136
01:22:45,107 --> 01:22:46,378
Yu Jae Seok's Game.

2137
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:47,538
I know what this is. I've seen it.

2138
01:22:47,637 --> 01:22:49,948
You have to give an irrelevant answer to his questions.

2139
01:22:50,177 --> 01:22:51,647
- You've seen it, right? - I have.

2140
01:22:51,647 --> 01:22:53,317
The rules are simple.

2141
01:22:53,378 --> 01:22:56,948
You have to give three irrelevant answers to my questions.

2142
01:22:57,248 --> 01:22:59,557
You cannot ask a question back.

2143
01:22:59,557 --> 01:23:00,588
How much money do we get?

2144
01:23:00,757 --> 01:23:01,988
- The winner gets 5 dollars. - 5 dollars?

2145
01:23:01,988 --> 01:23:03,658
- Five dollars. - Let's win, Sae Ho.

2146
01:23:03,658 --> 01:23:04,658
- Okay. - Please.

2147
01:23:04,658 --> 01:23:06,628
Let's get started. Who wants to go first?

2148
01:23:06,628 --> 01:23:07,857
- Kwang Soo. - Okay, I'll go.

2149
01:23:07,857 --> 01:23:08,927
He's good in this.

2150
01:23:08,927 --> 01:23:10,967
He's really good.

2151
01:23:10,967 --> 01:23:12,668
- Watch. - You're right after him, Sun Mi.

2152
01:23:12,668 --> 01:23:14,137
- Okay. - Ready, set, go.

2153
01:23:14,368 --> 01:23:15,738
What does Seung Un remind you of?

2154
01:23:15,738 --> 01:23:16,738
Sundae and tripe.

2155
01:23:16,738 --> 01:23:18,637
(Sundae and tripe)

2156
01:23:18,637 --> 01:23:19,878
Wait. Sundae and tripe.

2157
01:23:20,538 --> 01:23:22,507
I mean... Is this how it goes?

2158
01:23:22,507 --> 01:23:24,048
- This won't work? - Kwang Soo.

2159
01:23:24,048 --> 01:23:26,647
- That's possible. - It is.

2160
01:23:26,647 --> 01:23:28,517
- This won't work? - It's food.

2161
01:23:28,847 --> 01:23:30,817
- I'll give you another chance. - Okay.

2162
01:23:30,847 --> 01:23:32,817
That was so funny. What do I do?

2163
01:23:32,817 --> 01:23:33,958
- Ready. - Okay.

2164
01:23:34,257 --> 01:23:36,257
Set, go. What is your girlfriend's nickname?

2165
01:23:36,257 --> 01:23:37,757
Diaper.

2166
01:23:37,757 --> 01:23:39,958
(Her nickname is Diaper?)

2167
01:23:40,397 --> 01:23:41,757
- She must be really young. - What's wrong?

2168
01:23:41,757 --> 01:23:43,868
- How old is she? - What happened?

2169
01:23:43,868 --> 01:23:45,467
This is so hard.

2170
01:23:45,467 --> 01:23:48,668
You can't think ahead. Elijah is next.

2171
01:23:48,668 --> 01:23:50,868
She knows this game. She's practiced.

2172
01:23:50,868 --> 01:23:52,607
- No, no. - Be comfortable.

2173
01:23:52,607 --> 01:23:53,607
Ready.

2174
01:23:54,107 --> 01:23:57,378
Set, go. What is your boyfriend's nickname?

2175
01:23:57,378 --> 01:23:59,517
(She's buffering.)

2176
01:23:59,517 --> 01:24:00,548
Four.

2177
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:02,248
What is your boyfriend's nickname?

2178
01:24:02,448 --> 01:24:04,717
(What should I say?)

2179
01:24:04,717 --> 01:24:05,717
Four.

2180
01:24:06,088 --> 01:24:07,588
Why did it take you so long?

2181
01:24:07,817 --> 01:24:09,357
- Why did you take so long? - Why is it wrong?

2182
01:24:09,357 --> 01:24:11,557
You can't take time.

2183
01:24:11,557 --> 01:24:13,458
I usually speak slow though.

2184
01:24:13,458 --> 01:24:14,757
- No way. - That was slow.

2185
01:24:14,757 --> 01:24:16,267
I usually say weird things.

2186
01:24:16,267 --> 01:24:19,198
I think Elijah was thinking about her boyfriend.

2187
01:24:20,097 --> 01:24:22,198
We might get the wrong idea, so please reply right away.

2188
01:24:22,397 --> 01:24:24,338
- Sae Ho. - Ready.

2189
01:24:24,838 --> 01:24:27,278
Set, go. What was your nickname as a child?

2190
01:24:27,278 --> 01:24:28,538
Thank you for your business.

2191
01:24:28,538 --> 01:24:30,448
- What's in your bag? - Pigs' feet.

2192
01:24:30,448 --> 01:24:32,878
(Really?)

2193
01:24:32,878 --> 01:24:34,248
(Pigs' feet are daily necessities.)

2194
01:24:34,248 --> 01:24:35,918
That's how you gain weight.

2195
01:24:35,918 --> 01:24:38,187
That's why.

2196
01:24:38,387 --> 01:24:40,658
- Can I go again? I'm sorry. - You can try again.

2197
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:42,517
- Let's go. - Let's go. Ready.

2198
01:24:43,257 --> 01:24:46,357
Set, go. Please say something to your high school teacher.

2199
01:24:46,357 --> 01:24:47,357
Beef tripe.

2200
01:24:47,397 --> 01:24:48,857
(It's food again.)

2201
01:24:48,857 --> 01:24:50,668
- That's so rude. - Beef tripe.

2202
01:24:50,668 --> 01:24:53,937
(Beef tripe must be a part of his memory.)

2203
01:24:53,937 --> 01:24:54,998
- But this... - It kind of...

2204
01:24:54,998 --> 01:24:56,368
- Is that your teacher's nickname? - makes sense.

2205
01:24:56,368 --> 01:24:58,137
This must make his teacher feel bad.

2206
01:24:58,137 --> 01:25:00,208
- But I... - That's a rude thing to say.

2207
01:25:00,208 --> 01:25:02,948
- My question is... - It might be just a game, but...

2208
01:25:02,948 --> 01:25:05,378
- I tear up when I think of them. - Me too.

2209
01:25:05,378 --> 01:25:07,878
- I don't like this game. - I won't continue playing.

2210
01:25:08,548 --> 01:25:10,217
That's just not right.

2211
01:25:10,248 --> 01:25:12,248
- During high school, - His teacher probably feels bad.

2212
01:25:12,248 --> 01:25:14,857
Our teacher taught us for three years.

2213
01:25:14,857 --> 01:25:17,628
They made us into good people.

2214
01:25:17,628 --> 01:25:20,828
Can you edit this out? Because I...

2215
01:25:20,857 --> 01:25:25,897
- I think he... - We'll just edit you out entirely.

2216
01:25:26,397 --> 01:25:27,397
Just give him a finger flick.

2217
01:25:27,897 --> 01:25:29,168
You're going to edit me out entirely?

2218
01:25:29,168 --> 01:25:30,838
- Yes. - Can you just erase him?

2219
01:25:30,838 --> 01:25:33,908
- You're going to edit me out? - Can you erase him from the bus?

2220
01:25:33,908 --> 01:25:35,208
- Erase him. - We can't.

2221
01:25:35,238 --> 01:25:36,948
I'll give you one last chance, Sae Ho.

2222
01:25:36,948 --> 01:25:37,977
I'm sorry.

2223
01:25:38,147 --> 01:25:42,017
Ready. Set, go. Please say something to the director of the department.

2224
01:25:42,017 --> 01:25:43,187
You're so indecisive.

2225
01:25:43,187 --> 01:25:44,748
(He's unstoppable.)

2226
01:25:45,118 --> 01:25:46,557
(You don't cast me in shows. You must be indecisive.)

2227
01:25:46,557 --> 01:25:49,828
- How rude. - That was too much.

2228
01:25:49,887 --> 01:25:51,727
- Who's indecisive? - Who is?

2229
01:25:51,727 --> 01:25:53,458
- The director of the department? - How could you?

2230
01:25:53,458 --> 01:25:55,458
I don't think so.

2231
01:25:55,458 --> 01:25:56,498
Is it because he doesn't give you offers?

2232
01:25:56,828 --> 01:25:59,198
Our director is pretty determined.

2233
01:25:59,198 --> 01:26:00,567
He's indecisive.

2234
01:26:02,397 --> 01:26:03,738
Let's get started.

2235
01:26:03,738 --> 01:26:05,538
- Do you want to go, Sung Hoon? - Okay, I'll try it.

2236
01:26:05,538 --> 01:26:07,637
Let's go. Whom do you want to invite to your house?

2237
01:26:07,637 --> 01:26:08,637
My bag is small.

2238
01:26:08,637 --> 01:26:10,007
How many female celebrities do you have on your phone?

2239
01:26:10,007 --> 01:26:11,078
I want to go on the plane.

2240
01:26:11,078 --> 01:26:13,418
How does your body look after taking a shower?

2241
01:26:13,717 --> 01:26:15,618
(Exclaiming)

2242
01:26:16,988 --> 01:26:19,147
(He imagined himself...)

2243
01:26:19,147 --> 01:26:20,757
(after taking a shower.)

2244
01:26:20,757 --> 01:26:22,958
He thought about it. He was serious.

2245
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:24,387
- He did. - He imagined himself...

2246
01:26:24,387 --> 01:26:25,658
after taking a shower.

2247
01:26:25,658 --> 01:26:27,528
- Why does it have to be showering? - There must be something special.

2248
01:26:27,528 --> 01:26:29,397
- What's wrong with taking a shower? - He's secretive.

2249
01:26:29,397 --> 01:26:32,368
- What's wrong with taking a shower? - Were you proud?

2250
01:26:32,397 --> 01:26:34,038
- What's there to it? - Is there something?

2251
01:26:34,097 --> 01:26:36,137
Let's go again. Go.

2252
01:26:36,208 --> 01:26:37,767
What object does So Min resemble?

2253
01:26:37,767 --> 01:26:39,038
I want to work out my chest.

2254
01:26:39,038 --> 01:26:40,137
What commercials do you want to shoot?

2255
01:26:40,137 --> 01:26:41,238
- I want to work out my back. - That startled me.

2256
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:42,578
What body part do you wash first when you take a shower?

2257
01:26:42,647 --> 01:26:44,107
(Gosh)

2258
01:26:44,147 --> 01:26:45,147
What body part do you wash first when you take a shower?

2259
01:26:45,147 --> 01:26:46,977
(Is it the shower again?)

2260
01:26:46,977 --> 01:26:48,618
What's wrong?

2261
01:26:48,618 --> 01:26:50,517
He does this every time the shower comes up.

2262
01:26:50,517 --> 01:26:53,118
- What's wrong with taking a shower? - What is it?

2263
01:26:53,118 --> 01:26:54,958
He must be traumatized.

2264
01:26:54,958 --> 01:26:57,187
Let's say this never happened. Can I go again?

2265
01:26:57,528 --> 01:26:59,498
- What's wrong? - There's no progress.

2266
01:26:59,658 --> 01:27:00,757
Let's go.

2267
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:01,757
(He gets competitive and tries again.)

2268
01:27:01,757 --> 01:27:03,298
What do you do first thing in the morning?

2269
01:27:03,298 --> 01:27:04,597
We're going at 60km per hour.

2270
01:27:04,767 --> 01:27:06,198
When do you think you look the most handsome?

2271
01:27:06,198 --> 01:27:07,238
Hangang Park.

2272
01:27:07,238 --> 01:27:08,668
What's the first thing you do after taking a bath?

2273
01:27:08,868 --> 01:27:11,807
(Gosh)

2274
01:27:11,807 --> 01:27:13,038
(Is it bath this time?)

2275
01:27:13,038 --> 01:27:14,437
What do you do?

2276
01:27:14,437 --> 01:27:15,937
Don't you weigh yourself?

2277
01:27:15,937 --> 01:27:17,977
What do you do after taking a bath?

2278
01:27:17,977 --> 01:27:19,647
You look too happy.

2279
01:27:19,647 --> 01:27:20,778
Do you get happy?

2280
01:27:21,248 --> 01:27:23,248
- Do you get really happy? - I didn't know what to say.

2281
01:27:23,717 --> 01:27:25,418
- Does it make you happy? - Z Young, do you want to go?

2282
01:27:25,918 --> 01:27:27,557
- Me! I'll go. - Okay.

2283
01:27:27,557 --> 01:27:28,757
- Z Young. - Go.

2284
01:27:29,118 --> 01:27:30,387
What do you call your husband?

2285
01:27:30,458 --> 01:27:31,458
Two white hairs.

2286
01:27:32,458 --> 01:27:33,458
Really?

2287
01:27:33,597 --> 01:27:36,067
(You call your husband "Two white hairs"?)

2288
01:27:36,067 --> 01:27:38,597
- Is that what you call him? - You call him that?

2289
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:41,267
- Why? - That's strange.

2290
01:27:41,267 --> 01:27:43,137
Do you think this makes sense?

2291
01:27:43,137 --> 01:27:45,038
- Give her another chance. - Of course, it does.

2292
01:27:45,038 --> 01:27:46,177
- Hold on. - Give her a chance.

2293
01:27:46,177 --> 01:27:47,437
We'll give you another chance.

2294
01:27:47,437 --> 01:27:50,708
- Z Young is bad at games like this. - I am.

2295
01:27:50,748 --> 01:27:53,817
- Plus, she always finds it unfair. - Listen to the question.

2296
01:27:53,817 --> 01:27:55,847
I thought it would be easy, but you know me well.

2297
01:27:55,847 --> 01:27:57,088
Let's go again.

2298
01:27:57,088 --> 01:27:58,647
My questions were carefully selected.

2299
01:27:58,647 --> 01:27:59,658
Let's go again.

2300
01:28:00,158 --> 01:28:01,618
When were you the happiest after getting married?

2301
01:28:01,618 --> 01:28:04,158
50 years from now...

2302
01:28:04,158 --> 01:28:06,857
(50 years from now?)

2303
01:28:10,168 --> 01:28:11,868
That's great.

2304
01:28:11,868 --> 01:28:13,668
You can be happy for 50 years.

2305
01:28:13,767 --> 01:28:14,767
That's nice.

2306
01:28:14,767 --> 01:28:15,767
(Seok Jin tries to take care of it.)

2307
01:28:15,838 --> 01:28:17,967
That's great, Z Young.

2308
01:28:17,967 --> 01:28:19,607
I don't even know what I'm saying.

2309
01:28:19,607 --> 01:28:20,937
You sound so happy.

2310
01:28:20,937 --> 01:28:23,448
- She's happy. - I'm jealous.

2311
01:28:23,607 --> 01:28:25,548
I didn't know you would ask that.

2312
01:28:25,548 --> 01:28:26,977
(Please live happily with Mr. Two White Hairs.)

2313
01:28:28,248 --> 01:28:29,548
- Let's go, Kei. - Okay.

2314
01:28:29,618 --> 01:28:30,717
All right.

2315
01:28:30,748 --> 01:28:31,948
Which Running Man member did you look forward to meeting?

2316
01:28:31,948 --> 01:28:33,418
My real name is Kim Ji Yeon.

2317
01:28:33,557 --> 01:28:34,658
Which guest are you most afraid of?

2318
01:28:34,658 --> 01:28:36,328
I'm so happy to be Lovelyz.

2319
01:28:36,357 --> 01:28:39,557
- When do you think you're cute? - I love you, Running Man.

2320
01:28:39,557 --> 01:28:42,158
(I love you, Running Man.)

2321
01:28:42,158 --> 01:28:44,368
She's so good.

2322
01:28:44,368 --> 01:28:45,927
- This is fun. - She did it.

2323
01:28:45,927 --> 01:28:47,368
She's good.

2324
01:28:47,368 --> 01:28:49,067
- That's awesome. - Okay.

2325
01:28:49,067 --> 01:28:50,107
It is.

2326
01:28:50,107 --> 01:28:52,038
Right, you get money.

2327
01:28:54,637 --> 01:28:58,007
(The bus is almost at the Korean table d'hote restaurant.)

2328
01:28:58,007 --> 01:28:59,418
Most importantly,

2329
01:29:00,147 --> 01:29:02,248
Jong Kook should be okay, right?

2330
01:29:02,248 --> 01:29:03,548
(He starts to feel anxious as they near their destination.)

2331
01:29:03,548 --> 01:29:05,088
Luckily...

2332
01:29:05,088 --> 01:29:07,618
We're almost done for today.

2333
01:29:07,988 --> 01:29:09,387
- That's right. - He likes it.

2334
01:29:09,387 --> 01:29:11,958
- What does he like? - He already beat me up enough.

2335
01:29:12,528 --> 01:29:13,658
He should let us switch.

2336
01:29:13,658 --> 01:29:15,498
- Of course. - This wasn't a penalty.

2337
01:29:15,498 --> 01:29:17,397
He just beat me up. He hit me.

2338
01:29:17,397 --> 01:29:19,868
- I watched it. - We can take it to court.

2339
01:29:19,868 --> 01:29:21,097
Let me see your arm, Kwang Soo.

2340
01:29:21,267 --> 01:29:23,538
- It hurts. - It's still red.

2341
01:29:23,538 --> 01:29:25,137
(His arm is swollen.)

2342
01:29:25,137 --> 01:29:27,607
(What happened between them?)

2343
01:29:29,278 --> 01:29:31,007
(The Couple Race becomes...)

2344
01:29:31,007 --> 01:29:35,448
(more intense and fiery.)

2345
01:29:35,448 --> 01:29:39,317
(Let's see if you or I win.)

2346
01:29:39,317 --> 01:29:42,857
(Which couple will survive this war?)

2347
01:29:42,857 --> 01:29:45,828
(Where are you touching, Sae Ho?)

2348
01:29:45,828 --> 01:29:47,998
(Don't be mistaken.)

2349
01:29:48,397 --> 01:29:49,528
(And)

2350
01:29:50,498 --> 01:29:54,238
(Final Race of Half and Half Project )

2351
01:29:54,238 --> 01:29:56,807
(Darkness surrounds the Running Man members.)

2352
01:29:57,868 --> 01:30:05,177
(Let's start playing a game.)

2353
01:30:06,147 --> 01:30:08,918
(They get locked up in a prison without any explanation.)

2354
01:30:08,918 --> 01:30:14,317
(Only those who escape can survive the ultimate mission.)

2355
01:30:15,187 --> 01:30:18,128
(Final Half and Half Project: Roulette Prison)
