12
00:00:40,247 --> 00:00:44,117
(There are also hideous vacation places which the staff recommended.)

13
00:00:44,117 --> 00:00:49,016
(8 recommendations from the members and 8 recommendations from the crew)

14
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:52,226

17
00:00:59,796 --> 00:01:01,537

(Cute charm)

00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:48,317
(Sexy charm)

38
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,117

(Those charming guests have fully adapted to Running Man.)

40
00:01:55,817 --> 00:01:58,526
(Have they really adapted to it?)

41
00:02:00,056 --> 00:02:04,297
(They end showing off their charms and begin their race.)

42
00:02:05,026 --> 00:02:06,226
Each couple...

43
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:09,336
(There are 14 remaining vacation spots.)

44
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:12,367
(The staff has added two more balls about mission money in the box.)

45
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:15,906
(Each couple draws 2 balls from the box among the total of 16 balls.)

46
00:02:17,077 --> 00:02:22,147
(What the winning couple has picked will be put on the roulette.)

47
00:02:23,846 --> 00:02:26,346
(And they begin the lunch mission suddenly.)

48
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,756
(Their destinations are decided by the order of arrival.)

49
00:02:29,756 --> 00:02:33,186
(Everyone wants to have Korean table d'hote.)

50
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:36,096
(Jae Seok is forced out to have samgyetang.)

51
00:02:36,427 --> 00:02:37,626
- Hey. - What?

52
00:02:37,727 --> 00:02:39,626
(Let's switch destinations.)

53
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:42,336
(They plan to change destinations and have Korean table d'hote.)

54
00:02:42,436 --> 00:02:45,237
(They secretly and quietly snatch the Korean table d'hote.)

55
00:02:45,237 --> 00:02:46,836
- Jae Seok. - Yes?

56
00:02:46,836 --> 00:02:50,547
(Be prepared to be my Korean table d'hote menu.)

57
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:51,806
(He acts like he doesn't know.)

58
00:02:51,947 --> 00:02:53,246
All right.

59
00:02:53,246 --> 00:02:56,716
(Jong Kook is upset. How will the members' fate turn out to be?)

60
00:02:58,316 --> 00:03:00,457
(The bus is almost there at the Korean table d'hote place.)

61
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:01,656
I'm not worried about anything...

62
00:03:02,556 --> 00:03:03,686
except for Jong Kook.

63
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:06,026
(They're anxious.)

64
00:03:06,026 --> 00:03:10,026
- Thankfully... - We have not much shooting left.

65
00:03:10,297 --> 00:03:11,367
Right.

66
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:14,036
And he beat me up so hard,

67
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:15,566
so he can do this much.

68
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:17,466
- That's only natural. - It wasn't a penalty.

69
00:03:17,466 --> 00:03:19,306
He literally beat me up.

70
00:03:19,306 --> 00:03:21,737
- I agree. - Don't you agree?

71
00:03:21,737 --> 00:03:23,107
Let me see your arm.

72
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:25,346
- Seriously. - Goodness.

73
00:03:25,346 --> 00:03:26,547
(The story behind his swollen arm)

74
00:03:26,547 --> 00:03:29,816
(It'll be revealed now.)

75
00:03:30,947 --> 00:03:33,147
(1 hour before they board the buses)

76
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:34,186
Let's go.

77
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:37,357
This mission is called Add the Numbers.

78
00:03:37,357 --> 00:03:39,357
(Add the Numbers)

79
00:03:39,357 --> 00:03:40,727
You'll either be penalized to get hit on your forehead...

80
00:03:40,727 --> 00:03:43,056
or obtain more mission money through this mission.

81
00:03:43,827 --> 00:03:45,566
A couple will throw two dice.

82
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:48,566
They'll follow what it says regarding the added-up number.

83
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:52,267
If the 2 numbers add up to 7,

84
00:03:52,336 --> 00:03:55,276
they have to get hit on their foreheads once.

85
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,906
Then they can raise the number of forehead hits as they want...

86
00:03:57,906 --> 00:04:00,006
and throw the dice again.

87
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:05,117
If the 2 numbers add up to 8, they have to choose...

88
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,056
whether to get the total hits or to avoid it by paying 3 dollars.

89
00:04:08,056 --> 00:04:09,816
- Three dollars... - You need to get hit instead.

90
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:13,086
If the 2 numbers add up to 9, they will get the total hits...

91
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,156
and throw the dice once again.

92
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:18,566
If the 2 numbers add up to 6, the playing order will go backwards.

93
00:04:18,797 --> 00:04:21,467
If the numbers are double 1 or double 6,

94
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:25,467
they will have an exciting dance time and take the accumulated fine.

95
00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:26,706
- That sounds great. - They'll also...

96
00:04:26,706 --> 00:04:30,277
decide on who will get the accumulated forehead hits.

97
00:04:30,277 --> 00:04:33,206
(The added number of their dice will play a critical role.)

98
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,446
Sae Ho, you can do it, right?

99
00:04:34,446 --> 00:04:35,946
Sure, I can do this.

100
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:38,117
It's going this way.

101
00:04:38,117 --> 00:04:39,746
You'll throw the dice in this order.

102
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,787
Ji Hyo and Sae Ho will start first.

103
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:43,787
Let's go!

104
00:04:44,556 --> 00:04:45,626
Shall I throw it first?

105
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:48,556
It's all bad except for the double numbers.

106
00:04:49,027 --> 00:04:50,696
It's good to have 6 or 1.

107
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:51,967
I'll go first.

108
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:54,167
- I'll go. - You better throw it well.

109
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:57,337
You've done nothing well so far.

110
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,177
- I didn't do well? - No.

111
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:03,037
Okay. 1, 2, 3.

112
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:05,446
(He powerfully throws his die.)

113
00:05:05,477 --> 00:05:07,847
- It's four. - It's not good.

114
00:05:07,847 --> 00:05:10,487
- It'll be 7, 8, or 9 for certain. - 7, 8, or 9.

115
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:11,787
It'll be either 7, 8, or 9 for certain.

116
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:12,987
Make it six.

117
00:05:13,717 --> 00:05:15,816
- It'll be 10 then. - I'll go.

118
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,357
(Will the lucky Ji Hyo avoid paying the fine and getting the penalty?)

119
00:05:18,357 --> 00:05:19,527
Ji Hyo can avoid it.

120
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:23,427
(Will the lucky Ji Hyo avoid paying the fine and getting the penalty?)

121
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:26,326
It's nine.

122
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,566
- What is that? - They get the penalty for certain.

123
00:05:28,566 --> 00:05:30,636
- What is nine? - You get hit on your forehead.

124
00:05:30,636 --> 00:05:31,867
Gosh, you get the penalty.

125
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:33,407
Haha, do it.

126
00:05:33,537 --> 00:05:34,837
They get hit by whom? Us?

127
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:36,136
- Yes. - Oh, my.

128
00:05:36,206 --> 00:05:41,146
(Which one between the 2 will get the penalty for the 1st time?)

129
00:05:41,316 --> 00:05:42,547
Sae Ho will get hit.

130
00:05:42,547 --> 00:05:43,547
(Of course, it's Sae Ho.)

131
00:05:43,816 --> 00:05:44,946
Sae Ho will get hit.

132
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:47,587
- Is it going to be 1 of the 2? - Yes.

133
00:05:48,287 --> 00:05:49,287
Sae Ho will get slapped.

134
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,657
- Me? - Of course.

135
00:05:54,227 --> 00:05:56,297
- Are you good at this? - Not really.

136
00:05:56,896 --> 00:06:00,436
(It's his first time getting Haha's finger flick.)

137
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:02,537
(Slap)

138
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:06,537
(Thud)

139
00:06:06,537 --> 00:06:07,706
You're good at it.

140
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:10,076
- It was too weak. - Are you okay?

141
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:11,146
- Goodness. - It's not that bad.

142
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,376
It's bearable.

143
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:14,146
- Okay. - It's bearable.

144
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:16,576
Okay, let's move on.

145
00:06:17,717 --> 00:06:19,217
(After getting the forehead slap)

146
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:20,316
Please throw the dice again.

147
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:21,456
- Let's go. - Let's go.

148
00:06:21,456 --> 00:06:22,456
Go first.

149
00:06:22,456 --> 00:06:24,256
(They throw the dice again.)

150
00:06:26,556 --> 00:06:27,727
- 8. - It's 8.

151
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:30,256
(They have to either get the penalty or pay the fine and try again.)

152
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,297
- What is it? - Get the penalty or pay the fine.

153
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:34,696
(Penalty or fine)

154
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:36,837
Sae Ho, take it slowly.

155
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:39,136
Your forehead is so red now.

156
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,237
Are you going to get a forehead slap or pay three dollars?

157
00:06:41,237 --> 00:06:44,177
We don't have money. We can't pay three dollars.

158
00:06:44,177 --> 00:06:46,076
- I'll get the slap. - We have no money.

159
00:06:46,076 --> 00:06:47,547
(They have no choice.)

160
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:48,547
(Thud)

161
00:06:49,717 --> 00:06:51,087
(Getting slapped again)

162
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:53,217
- Goodness. - That must hurt a lot.

163
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:54,857
My goodness.

164
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,016
Please throw the dice.

165
00:06:56,316 --> 00:07:00,027
Excuse me. Until when will you throw the dice?

166
00:07:00,027 --> 00:07:02,626
- We need to move things along. - Listen.

167
00:07:02,727 --> 00:07:04,227
Let's enjoy the game together.

168
00:07:04,297 --> 00:07:06,566
I am terribly sorry,

169
00:07:06,696 --> 00:07:08,337
but I want to stop throwing the dice too.

170
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,867
I am only following the rules.

171
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:13,066
- I apologize. Here we go again. - We need to move on with the shoot.

172
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:14,436
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

173
00:07:14,576 --> 00:07:15,977
(It's their 3rd attempt.)

174
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,477
It will be 8 or 7.

175
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:18,677
- 8. - 8.

176
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:22,746
(It's 8 again.)

177
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:24,987
- Eight. - Take another slap.

178
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:27,316
- Take the penalty. - Take a slap on the forehead.

179
00:07:27,617 --> 00:07:28,756
- 8. - 8.

180
00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:30,626
(Is he playing the game by himself?)

181
00:07:30,626 --> 00:07:32,087
- People are waiting... - This is...

182
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:33,756
for their turns.

183
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:35,727
- Don't do this in front of us. - I am not doing this on purpose.

184
00:07:35,727 --> 00:07:38,566
- This is too much. - Bring us chairs.

185
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,936
- We need to move on with the shoot. - Let us have a turn.

186
00:07:40,936 --> 00:07:43,297
- I can't do this. This is hard. - Sae Ho, come on.

187
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:46,066
- Go on. - How many slaps am I taking?

188
00:07:47,206 --> 00:07:48,306
In 1, 2.

189
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:51,177
- My goodness. - You are good at this.

190
00:07:51,177 --> 00:07:52,376
(Please stop.)

191
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:53,777
You will have to throw the dice again.

192
00:07:54,246 --> 00:07:57,047
- My goodness. - What are you planning to do?

193
00:07:57,386 --> 00:07:58,587
Do we have to see blood?

194
00:07:58,587 --> 00:08:00,087
I will slap your forehead so hard this time.

195
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,556
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

196
00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:02,987
We did it.

197
00:08:02,987 --> 00:08:04,357
(What is the result of their 4th attempt?)

198
00:08:05,787 --> 00:08:09,357
11. We won't get a penalty. Okay.

199
00:08:09,357 --> 00:08:12,266
(They finally escape the never-ending cycle of dice.)

200
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:13,566
We did it.

201
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:16,066
- Shall we throw the dice? - Let's throw them together.

202
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:17,566
In 1, 2, 3.

203
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:18,806
(After a long wait, it's Kwang Soo and Seung Un's turn.)

204
00:08:21,806 --> 00:08:24,407
- 6. - 6.

205
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:25,907
(If it's 6...)

206
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:26,907
Okay.

207
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,177
(The dice come to them again.)

208
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:29,617
- It goes in the opposite direction. - It goes in the opposite direction.

209
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:32,217
- It's Sae Ho's turn again. - It goes in the opposite direction.

210
00:08:32,217 --> 00:08:34,617
(He receives a round of applause from the unlucky members.)

211
00:08:34,617 --> 00:08:36,656
It's Sae Ho and Ji Hyo's turn again.

212
00:08:36,656 --> 00:08:37,786
(Where is the end of this road?)

213
00:08:37,786 --> 00:08:39,557
Sae Ho, let us play.

214
00:08:39,557 --> 00:08:41,126
We need to move on with the shoot.

215
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:42,796
Look.

216
00:08:42,796 --> 00:08:46,567
We need to move on with the shoot since they are busy people.

217
00:08:46,766 --> 00:08:47,967
This is too much.

218
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,036
- I apologize, - We need to move on with the shoot.

219
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:53,607
but this is beyond my power.

220
00:08:54,307 --> 00:08:56,406
- Sae Ho is like a swamp. - I am sorry.

221
00:08:56,406 --> 00:08:57,406
(You can't escape from Sae Ho's swamp.)

222
00:08:57,577 --> 00:08:58,707
All right.

223
00:08:58,707 --> 00:09:00,176
(Ji Hyo and Sae Ho change the direction with 6.)

224
00:09:00,176 --> 00:09:01,246
- Throw the dice at the same time. - Let's throw them together.

225
00:09:01,246 --> 00:09:03,347
- Let's throw them together. - They will throw the dice together.

226
00:09:03,447 --> 00:09:04,687
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

227
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:06,987
- Let's go. - Let's go.

228
00:09:06,987 --> 00:09:10,117
(What is the result of their first attempt?)

229
00:09:10,987 --> 00:09:13,357
(Receive a penalty, or pay a fine and go again.)

230
00:09:14,097 --> 00:09:16,626
Receive a penalty, or pay a fine.

231
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:18,996
- It's a single slap, right? - You might not get another chance.

232
00:09:18,996 --> 00:09:21,136
Take a forehead slap this time.

233
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:22,896
Kwang Soo, would you be okay later?

234
00:09:23,837 --> 00:09:25,737
- I will take the forehead slap. - Really?

235
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:26,737
Should I slap you?

236
00:09:26,737 --> 00:09:27,906
(He sacrifices his body to save the mission money.)

237
00:09:27,906 --> 00:09:29,307
Where should I slap you?

238
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:30,506
Should I slap you here?

239
00:09:30,506 --> 00:09:32,006
- It doesn't matter where you slap. - How about the forehead?

240
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:33,506
- Slap wherever you want. - Really?

241
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:37,886
Jong Kook, smile. How is he supposed to slap you?

242
00:09:37,886 --> 00:09:38,987
(Don't be scared. Slap my forehead.)

243
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:40,246
- Why are you grabbing me? - It's nothing.

244
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,087
- It's not a title match. - I know.

245
00:09:42,087 --> 00:09:43,256
Slap me.

246
00:09:43,827 --> 00:09:45,886
(The betraying giraffe, Kwang Soo, versus Anyang tiger, Jong Kook)

247
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:48,656
Kwang Soo wasn't earning points from Jong Kook from the start.

248
00:09:49,026 --> 00:09:53,896
(Jong Koo, long time no see.)

249
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:56,766
(You hit me even when I was eating...)

250
00:09:56,766 --> 00:09:59,237
(or when I was with other people.)

251
00:09:59,237 --> 00:10:03,107
(You made me suffer in front of the guests.)

252
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:06,146
(Jong Kook, let me give you a forehead slap.)

253
00:10:09,447 --> 00:10:12,016
(He punches Jong Kook's forehead.)

254
00:10:12,016 --> 00:10:14,717
Wait a minute. It's not like that. Listen to me.

255
00:10:14,717 --> 00:10:17,327
You told me to slap however I wanted.

256
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:20,396
You told me to slap however I wanted.

257
00:10:20,396 --> 00:10:22,057
- My goodness. - It's not like that.

258
00:10:22,057 --> 00:10:23,357
You told me to slap however I wanted.

259
00:10:23,426 --> 00:10:24,766
You told me to slap however I wanted.

260
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:27,197
I am serious. He gave me permission.

261
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,896
Jong Kook, you told me to slap however I wanted.

262
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,166
(He can't contain the anger from getting his forehead punched.)

263
00:10:32,807 --> 00:10:33,906
Kwang Soo is over.

264
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:35,607
Jong Kook, you told me to slap however I wanted.

265
00:10:35,607 --> 00:10:36,776
Let me slap him once.

266
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:38,546
He shouldn't have used his hand.

267
00:10:38,546 --> 00:10:40,977
I also think that he didn't follow the rule.

268
00:10:40,977 --> 00:10:42,876
- He didn't follow the rule. - He deserves a slap.

269
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,947
- That's right. You deserve a slap. - A slap?

270
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:46,246
- That's right. - Take a slap.

271
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:47,687
- Shall I slap your wrist instead? - What?

272
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:49,187
- Shall I slap your wrist? - I will take a slap on the wrist.

273
00:10:49,187 --> 00:10:50,487
Shall I slap your wrist?

274
00:10:50,557 --> 00:10:51,886
That will hurt as well.

275
00:10:52,426 --> 00:10:53,996
That's going to hurt.

276
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:55,597
(Kwang Soo, I promise to go easy on you.)

277
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,227
I'm sorry for what I did.

278
00:10:57,227 --> 00:10:58,996
- Shall I slap your wrist? - Yes.

279
00:10:58,996 --> 00:11:02,496
(Why do I feel a chill down my spine?)

280
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:08,006
(He collapses.)

281
00:11:08,006 --> 00:11:09,176
For goodness' sake.

282
00:11:09,707 --> 00:11:12,607
(Are you in pain? I am in pain too.)

283
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,046
(Joyous, satisfied, and refreshed)

284
00:11:15,046 --> 00:11:16,516
Did you see that?

285
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,987
His hand went like this.

286
00:11:18,987 --> 00:11:21,987
In slow motion, you will see his arm bend.

287
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:25,126
(We hope Jong Kook and Kwang Soo will become close.)

288
00:11:25,386 --> 00:11:27,026
Let's move on.

289
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:29,526
(Jae Seok is scared from watching the event.)

290
00:11:29,526 --> 00:11:31,526
You might end up getting a slap from Jong Kook.

291
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:33,266
My ears are ringing from a slap on my wrist.

292
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,097
I might have one more person to slap.

293
00:11:35,097 --> 00:11:36,536
(Getting 8 or 9 earns me a slap from Jong Kook.)

294
00:11:36,536 --> 00:11:38,367
Sun Mi, let's pray that we complete the round safely.

295
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,807
(Let's complete the round safely.)

296
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:40,977
In 1, 2, 3.

297
00:11:41,006 --> 00:11:43,077
(Sun Mi goes first.)

298
00:11:43,707 --> 00:11:45,506
Three. I need to get three.

299
00:11:45,707 --> 00:11:47,217
Jae Seok. Jae Seok.

300
00:11:49,617 --> 00:11:50,717
Jae Seok.

301
00:11:52,617 --> 00:11:55,957
- What are you doing? - I want to watch.

302
00:11:56,386 --> 00:11:57,687
Am I not allowed to stand here?

303
00:11:58,256 --> 00:11:59,526
No, you aren't.

304
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:01,626
(Really?)

305
00:12:01,626 --> 00:12:02,697
My goodness.

306
00:12:03,396 --> 00:12:05,097
Why do you keep doing this to me?

307
00:12:05,526 --> 00:12:07,666
He quietly beckoned me over earlier and said,

308
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,607
"You should stay back since you are in a bad condition."

309
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:11,867
"Stay back?"

310
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:13,036
He said that my stories are too weak.

311
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:14,536
You are in a terrible condition today.

312
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:17,006
He told me to stay back after I apologize to Ji Hyo.

313
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:19,676
He said that I am doing a terrible job.

314
00:12:19,676 --> 00:12:21,376
- You are doing a terrible job. - Really?

315
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:22,717
- Your stories are too weak. - Really?

316
00:12:24,217 --> 00:12:29,416
(I must avoid 5 and 6 since Sun Mi got 3.)

317
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:31,886
- Eight. - This is the worst.

318
00:12:31,886 --> 00:12:33,926
(Receive a penalty, or pay a fine and go again.)

319
00:12:33,926 --> 00:12:36,496
(He is the original unlucky member.)

320
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:38,567
Will you receive a penalty or pay a fine?

321
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:42,036
(Choose between paying a fine and getting a slap from Jong Kook.)

322
00:12:42,036 --> 00:12:43,737
- Pay a fine. - Sun Mi, let's pay a fine.

323
00:12:43,737 --> 00:12:45,107
Sun Mi, it's only one slap.

324
00:12:45,237 --> 00:12:47,136
- Is it 1 slap? - It's only 1 slap.

325
00:12:47,136 --> 00:12:48,937
- If it's only one slap... - No way.

326
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:51,046
- Sun Mi has something to say. - I already received the change.

327
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:55,016
(Seok Jin and Sol Bi go next.)

328
00:12:55,717 --> 00:12:56,847
Eight.

329
00:12:56,847 --> 00:12:58,317
(Upon receiving 8, he pays a fine without a thought.)

330
00:12:58,317 --> 00:12:59,516
Let's pay up.

331
00:12:59,516 --> 00:13:01,016
Why would you do that?

332
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:03,827
- Look at his face. - Take a slap.

333
00:13:03,827 --> 00:13:05,786
- Look at his face. - You can't pay a fine.

334
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:07,526
You should take a slap.

335
00:13:08,827 --> 00:13:10,896
Why would you tell me what to do with my forehead?

336
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:12,467
(My forehead is precious.)

337
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:13,597
- What's wrong with you? - You can do this.

338
00:13:13,597 --> 00:13:15,666
- You can take the slap. - Then you should do it.

339
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,237
I am paying three dollars.

340
00:13:17,237 --> 00:13:18,367
They are paying a fine one after another.

341
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:21,577
We can take it back.

342
00:13:21,577 --> 00:13:23,406
- How will we take it back? - Listen.

343
00:13:23,406 --> 00:13:25,246
An incredible amount will come to us next time.

344
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:28,117
Sung Hoon and So Min.

345
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,947
So Min and Sung Hoon.

346
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:33,416
Seeing as how So Min is quiet, her heart must be fluttering.

347
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,016
(So Min is usually chatty.)

348
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,957
- That's not true. - She is in love.

349
00:13:38,057 --> 00:13:39,827
So Min is uncharacteristically quiet...

350
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,357
- in front of Sung Hoon. - Seriously.

351
00:13:42,727 --> 00:13:44,567
- That's not true. - Are you out of your mind?

352
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:45,626
Aren't you going to work?

353
00:13:46,227 --> 00:13:49,136
(Magnet, aren't you going to work?)

354
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:50,766
What do you think you are doing?

355
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:52,337
(A variety show is like a war. We have no time for romance.)

356
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:53,776
In 1, 2, 3.

357
00:13:53,776 --> 00:13:56,237
(Please let us have 1 and 1 or 6 and 6.)

358
00:13:56,237 --> 00:13:57,607
Come back to your senses. Focus.

359
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,146
11.

360
00:14:02,146 --> 00:14:03,376
(They get 11.)

361
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,617
Getting 6 and 6 would have been amazing.

362
00:14:05,617 --> 00:14:07,957
- We passed the round safely. - That was close.

363
00:14:07,957 --> 00:14:09,317
(His heart is pounding.)

364
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:10,487
This is nothing, but my heart is pounding.

365
00:14:10,487 --> 00:14:11,957
(This is nothing, but my heart is pounding.)

366
00:14:11,957 --> 00:14:15,256
(She gets to touch his chest.)

367
00:14:15,256 --> 00:14:19,967
(She feels his excitement and regret with her palm.)

368
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:23,467
Wait a minute. What are you doing?

369
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,506
- Why did you hold So Min's hand? - I was nervous.

370
00:14:26,036 --> 00:14:29,107
- I wanted her to feel my heartbeat. - Suddenly...

371
00:14:29,107 --> 00:14:32,707
Suddenly, he took my hand like this.

372
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:35,176
(Sung Hoon's behavior makes people feel excited and jealous.)

373
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:38,947
(It's the signal of the heart.)

374
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:40,217
This is an opportunity.

375
00:14:40,217 --> 00:14:42,117
- Did the order change? - Yes, it did.

376
00:14:42,117 --> 00:14:43,457
We are going in the opposite direction.

377
00:14:43,457 --> 00:14:46,187
- Throw high. - This is your chance.

378
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:48,097
Let's complete this round and slap someone.

379
00:14:48,227 --> 00:14:49,796
Let's complete this round and slap someone.

380
00:14:49,796 --> 00:14:51,327
Let's complete this round and slap someone.

381
00:14:51,327 --> 00:14:52,496
My goodness.

382
00:14:52,496 --> 00:14:53,896
(Six)

383
00:14:53,896 --> 00:14:55,766
- That's good. - You can do it.

384
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,406
You will take all the money if you get six.

385
00:14:57,536 --> 00:14:59,036
- We will earn money. - Six?

386
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:02,077
- You will take all if you get 6. - 6.

387
00:15:02,077 --> 00:15:03,176
6. 6.

388
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:04,607
Six.

389
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:06,046
Excuse me.

390
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:10,786
(The die doesn't roll.)

391
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:13,717
(I am a trickster.)

392
00:15:13,717 --> 00:15:15,457
I am sorry. I am sorry.

393
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,727
I didn't realize this before, but she is deceitful.

394
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:19,357
Stop complimenting her on everything she does.

395
00:15:19,357 --> 00:15:20,697
- I am sorry. - What was that?

396
00:15:20,697 --> 00:15:23,156
I will teach her well.

397
00:15:23,227 --> 00:15:25,666
- We will remedy the situation. - You need to host the game well.

398
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,496
They need to have some manners.

399
00:15:27,496 --> 00:15:28,666
Be quiet.

400
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,036
(Let's end it here.)

401
00:15:31,406 --> 00:15:32,837
(Sae Ho, your talk is weak.)

402
00:15:32,837 --> 00:15:35,337
- Please be quiet. - Okay.

403
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:37,406
Elijah.

404
00:15:37,876 --> 00:15:40,307
(He leaves after cutting Sae Ho off.)

405
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:41,876
You can't do that.

406
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:43,546
(Should I go home early?)

407
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,146
If you agree to this rule,

408
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:49,416
we will end the game when a team gets a same set of numbers.

409
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,386
- Okay. - We need a same set of numbers.

410
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:52,987
That's right.

411
00:15:54,756 --> 00:15:55,827
You can go first.

412
00:15:55,827 --> 00:15:57,597
- It's their turn. - Okay.

413
00:15:57,597 --> 00:15:58,597
(It's So Min and Sung Hoon's turn.)

414
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:03,036
- Two. - Sung Hoon, get two.

415
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:04,607
- Two. - Two.

416
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:09,707
(Sung Hoon needs to get 2.)

417
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:10,876
He did it.

418
00:16:12,006 --> 00:16:13,246
(They get 2 and 2.)

419
00:16:13,246 --> 00:16:14,516
Sung Hoon!

420
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:17,617
(So Min and Sung Hoon take the accumulated fine.)

421
00:16:17,617 --> 00:16:20,117
It's unfortunate that it ended before us.

422
00:16:21,117 --> 00:16:23,317
- You should dance. - Should we dance?

423
00:16:23,557 --> 00:16:25,026
Should we dance?

424
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,126
(Dancing)

425
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:27,957
Should we dance?

426
00:16:28,327 --> 00:16:31,166
(So Min and Sung Hoon win Add the Numbers with an odd dance.)

427
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,327
Whose dance are you imitating?

428
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:35,937
All right.

429
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:38,406
- Thank you. - Thank you.

430
00:16:38,906 --> 00:16:40,337
This mission includes...

431
00:16:40,506 --> 00:16:43,337
meal cards and mission money.

432
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:45,046
- Meal cards. - It would be great to eat.

433
00:16:45,146 --> 00:16:47,146
Guess the Movie.

434
00:16:47,146 --> 00:16:49,246
- Guess the Movie? - What is that?

435
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:52,146
Guess the Movie?

436
00:16:52,146 --> 00:16:54,617
Oh, it's about listening to a movie scene.

437
00:16:54,687 --> 00:16:57,957
You have to guess the title of a given video clip.

438
00:16:57,957 --> 00:17:00,557
If you choose the section of the video which you'd like to listen,

439
00:17:01,197 --> 00:17:04,296
we will play the video from that part for 10 seconds.

440
00:17:04,426 --> 00:17:07,636
You have to guess its title right only by listening to the scene.

441
00:17:07,696 --> 00:17:10,537
It may be a scene from a drama or a movie.

442
00:17:10,537 --> 00:17:11,537
(The questions are not only from movies this time.)

443
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:16,577
The winning couple will be given a meal card and 10 dollars.

444
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,807
Nice.

445
00:17:17,807 --> 00:17:21,117
And the couple in the second place will be given a meal card.

446
00:17:21,117 --> 00:17:24,146
The rest will be given dried laver and rice.

447
00:17:24,146 --> 00:17:26,547
(The rest will be given dried laver and rice.)

448
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:27,986
There's nothing we can do with dried laver.

449
00:17:27,986 --> 00:17:29,916
Make it just for the couple who places last.

450
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,287
- There's nothing we can do with it. - I'm hungry.

451
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,827
You need to press a strange buzzer in order to get a chance to speak.

452
00:17:35,827 --> 00:17:36,827
A strange buzzer?

453
00:17:36,827 --> 00:17:38,097
(It's another upgraded rule.)

454
00:17:38,097 --> 00:17:40,867
(They must clear a simple mission...)

455
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:43,067
(to get a chance to speak for each question.)

456
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:45,406
After listening to a 10-second audio,

457
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:48,607
the couple who first presses the buzzer will get to speak.

458
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:53,277
You'll get to choose another section to listen to before you guess.

459
00:17:53,277 --> 00:17:54,517
(They will get to pick another section to listen to.)

460
00:17:54,517 --> 00:17:58,547
(It means they can listen to it once more if they ring the buzzer.)

461
00:17:58,547 --> 00:18:02,386
If you guess wrongly, the couple on your right will be given a chance.

462
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:03,926
(The couple on their right will guess.)

463
00:18:03,926 --> 00:18:07,097
(The mission money and meal cards are on the line.)

464
00:18:07,097 --> 00:18:10,226
(Only two teams will be able to have a delicious meal.)

465
00:18:10,226 --> 00:18:12,726
(Which couple will succeed in acquiring the meal cards?)

466
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,736
The female members will have to ring the buzzer for this question.

467
00:18:16,736 --> 00:18:17,807
- All right. - I need to press it.

468
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:19,636
- The female members. - That's right.

469
00:18:19,636 --> 00:18:20,837
Do I go out and guess?

470
00:18:21,037 --> 00:18:22,636
- What? - I don't understand.

471
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:24,307
Only the female members can ring the buzzer this time.

472
00:18:24,307 --> 00:18:25,946
- So I go and ring the buzzer. - Right.

473
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:28,047
You need to tear plastic wrap...

474
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:30,017
to press this first buzzer.

475
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:32,646
(The first buzzer is about plastic wrap.)

476
00:18:32,716 --> 00:18:33,787
(They understand.)

477
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:35,386
- All right. - What?

478
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,486
What does he mean? How do I tear it?

479
00:18:37,587 --> 00:18:38,986
- With your face. - Goodness.

480
00:18:39,257 --> 00:18:41,557
Here's why I feel bad about her.

481
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:43,027
She's been teasing Seok Jin...

482
00:18:43,027 --> 00:18:44,867
for not understanding rules throughout the day.

483
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:47,396
(She's been teasing Seok Jin throughout the day.)

484
00:18:47,396 --> 00:18:49,837
- She's worse. - What are you doing?

485
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:52,107
Seok Jin understands the rules better than you.

486
00:18:52,206 --> 00:18:53,807
- We have to use only our faces? - You...

487
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:55,876
- I feel confident because of you. - Seok Jin.

488
00:18:55,876 --> 00:18:57,976
Just wait. I'm not going to ask you from now on.

489
00:18:59,777 --> 00:19:00,817
Z Young.

490
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:04,486
- It's from a drama this time. - Okay.

491
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:06,317
All right.

492
00:19:06,317 --> 00:19:08,857
I'll play the video for 10 seconds now.

493
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:10,986
- Here we go. - Let's go.

494
00:19:10,986 --> 00:19:12,426
(They have to guess the drama title.)

495
00:19:12,757 --> 00:19:16,156
(Which couple will get the first question right?)

496
00:19:17,097 --> 00:19:19,267
Who told you to do such work?

497
00:19:19,396 --> 00:19:22,537
Your business will get better once the weather gets warm.

498
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,037
Why would you choose to suffer? Think of your age too.

499
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,267
We're still in our youth.

500
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:29,077
Don't worry about us, and take care of yourself.

501
00:19:29,077 --> 00:19:31,007
- Hold on. - Go ring it.

502
00:19:31,007 --> 00:19:32,847
Go ring the buzzer.

503
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:34,416
- Do you know what it is? - Do you know?

504
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,547
Yes. Do it.

505
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:37,716
(Do you want me to tear the wrap with my face?)

506
00:19:37,716 --> 00:19:39,247
You better get it right.

507
00:19:40,486 --> 00:19:41,617
(They have no idea.)

508
00:19:42,456 --> 00:19:43,557
Do you know?

509
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,327
I think it's a series drama. The actor...

510
00:19:46,956 --> 00:19:48,997
(They must tear the plastic wrap first to speak.)

511
00:19:48,997 --> 00:19:50,196
Goodness.

512
00:19:52,896 --> 00:19:54,696
- Goodness. - You can do it.

513
00:19:54,696 --> 00:19:57,206
1, 2, 3.

514
00:19:57,736 --> 00:20:00,007
- That's not enough. - You need to do it harder.

515
00:20:01,236 --> 00:20:02,577
(That's not enough.)

516
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:03,676
It's that thick?

517
00:20:03,747 --> 00:20:06,577
- Gosh, your face. - Your face has been stamped on it.

518
00:20:07,117 --> 00:20:08,216
(You can tell it's Z Young.)

519
00:20:08,277 --> 00:20:10,646
- Gosh, your face... - How do I do it?

520
00:20:11,017 --> 00:20:12,317
- Awesome. - Goodness.

521
00:20:12,317 --> 00:20:13,857
It's worth keeping.

522
00:20:13,857 --> 00:20:15,357
- Take it home. - Take it to your house.

523
00:20:16,386 --> 00:20:18,456
- Your face... - Your face's been stamped on it.

524
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:20,926
Even your double eyelids are there.

525
00:20:20,926 --> 00:20:23,257
(Her challenge left a huge mark.)

526
00:20:23,257 --> 00:20:24,367
How could...

527
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,597
You can try it at the same time.

528
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:29,966
You just to need to tear it first.

529
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:31,406
I need to tear it before the others do?

530
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:32,436
You can try it at the same time.

531
00:20:32,436 --> 00:20:33,636
(Is that right?)

532
00:20:33,636 --> 00:20:35,807
- You just to need to tear it first. - Really?

533
00:20:35,807 --> 00:20:36,936
Yes, you need to tear it before the others do.

534
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:40,646
(She doesn't hesitate.)

535
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:42,646
So Min...

536
00:20:42,646 --> 00:20:43,787
So Min...

537
00:20:43,787 --> 00:20:45,416
(That's not how you use your pretty face.)

538
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,087
- Goodness. - So Min.

539
00:20:47,817 --> 00:20:49,416
(So Min succeeds.)

540
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,626
- How did you... - So Min succeeds.

541
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:51,726
- How did she do it? - All right.

542
00:20:51,726 --> 00:20:53,456
- You get a chance to guess. - That was amazing.

543
00:20:53,656 --> 00:20:55,696
(She's in shock.)

544
00:20:56,626 --> 00:20:58,497
I know the answer.

545
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:00,097
Hold on. She might get it wrong.

546
00:21:00,097 --> 00:21:01,896
- All right. - Let's wait and see.

547
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:03,666
Is it a daily drama?

548
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:07,337
Please play the video from 31 minutes.

549
00:21:08,107 --> 00:21:09,337
All right. Wait.

550
00:21:09,777 --> 00:21:12,976
This is the construction report on the lands in Gangnam.

551
00:21:13,176 --> 00:21:14,416
Please review it.

552
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,587
Is that so? Did you organize them already?

553
00:21:18,587 --> 00:21:20,886
I'm sure it's Kim Yong Gun's voice.

554
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:24,557
Hurry up, and get it wrong.

555
00:21:26,027 --> 00:21:28,456
- What is this? - I have no idea.

556
00:21:28,456 --> 00:21:29,557
Just guess anything.

557
00:21:29,757 --> 00:21:30,867
What is your answer?

558
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:31,896
The answer is...

559
00:21:31,896 --> 00:21:37,537
(There's Kim Yong Gun's voice in the ordinary conversation.)

560
00:21:37,837 --> 00:21:39,007
- Stop. - The answer is...

561
00:21:39,206 --> 00:21:41,936
"Woman of Dignity".

562
00:21:43,476 --> 00:21:44,976
"Woman of Dignity".

563
00:21:45,077 --> 00:21:46,406
(It's wrong.)

564
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:48,376
- I just don't know. - Gosh, this...

565
00:21:48,376 --> 00:21:49,446
I think I know.

566
00:21:49,446 --> 00:21:51,587
- His voice is so familiar. - Exactly.

567
00:21:51,587 --> 00:21:53,956
- The way he talks... - When I heard the second audio...

568
00:21:54,686 --> 00:21:55,857
I'll go.

569
00:21:56,087 --> 00:21:57,787
Please play the video from 13 minutes and 20 seconds.

570
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,226
- Honey, hurry out. - Okay.

571
00:22:01,226 --> 00:22:02,357
"Honey"?

572
00:22:03,226 --> 00:22:05,297
I'm sure it's Kim Yong Gun's voice.

573
00:22:05,297 --> 00:22:06,466
(The sound of his leaving)

574
00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:07,696
The drama...

575
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:10,196
(The sound of closing doors)

576
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:12,607
- What? - You picked the wrong part.

577
00:22:12,607 --> 00:22:14,807
- We only heard door sounds. - They're closing doors.

578
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:17,176
Goodness.

579
00:22:17,176 --> 00:22:18,676
I can only hear door sounds.

580
00:22:19,577 --> 00:22:21,777
(His choice isn't of help at all.)

581
00:22:21,777 --> 00:22:22,847
They're closing doors.

582
00:22:22,847 --> 00:22:24,446
- Seok Jin. - Is it "Love on a Jujube Tree"?

583
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:25,446
(Whispering)

584
00:22:26,587 --> 00:22:29,386
(Did Haha figure out something?)

585
00:22:30,186 --> 00:22:31,587
But he said, "Honey."

586
00:22:31,587 --> 00:22:32,926
"We Got Married" is too...

587
00:22:32,926 --> 00:22:34,456
Do you think I'm a fool?

588
00:22:35,156 --> 00:22:37,797
(Kim Yong Gun was on "We Got Married"?)

589
00:22:37,797 --> 00:22:39,426
He told me it's "We Got Married" because he said, "Honey."

590
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:40,466
(Whatever)

591
00:22:40,936 --> 00:22:42,597
- "We Got Married". - Goodness.

592
00:22:42,837 --> 00:22:43,936
Can it be something about an earthen pot?

593
00:22:43,936 --> 00:22:44,966
What is your guess?

594
00:22:44,966 --> 00:22:46,206
"Seoul Earthen Pot".

595
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:48,476
That's so old.

596
00:22:48,777 --> 00:22:50,446
I didn't know you'd remember "Seoul Earthen Pot".

597
00:22:50,446 --> 00:22:53,277
She told me if it was "Chief Inspector".

598
00:22:53,376 --> 00:22:54,547
"Chief Inspector".

599
00:22:54,547 --> 00:22:57,087
- 15 minutes. - Last one ended with water sound.

600
00:22:57,087 --> 00:22:59,117
- Something might come out after. - After that part?

601
00:22:59,117 --> 00:23:00,557
- We choose 15 minutes. - Okay.

602
00:23:00,557 --> 00:23:02,456
- Okay, 15 minutes. - All right.

603
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:03,486
(Will there be any important clues?)

604
00:23:04,156 --> 00:23:06,057
He wore the same ring as mine.

605
00:23:06,827 --> 00:23:08,527
- Is that a commercial? - And he...

606
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:10,567
kissed me too.

607
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:12,166
So what does it mean?

608
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:14,936
You wear matching rings and have kissed too.

609
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:17,466
- It means... - Goodness.

610
00:23:17,636 --> 00:23:18,736
Can it be "My Husband Got a Family"?

611
00:23:18,736 --> 00:23:20,067
- I don't know. - Goodness.

612
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:21,406
Can it be?

613
00:23:21,577 --> 00:23:22,607
This drama...

614
00:23:23,376 --> 00:23:24,476
It's driving me crazy.

615
00:23:24,547 --> 00:23:26,376
- What is your answer? - "My Husband Got a Family".

616
00:23:26,376 --> 00:23:28,216
- I think it's right. - No.

617
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:31,087
(Acting smart)

618
00:23:31,087 --> 00:23:32,617
Did it make a hit?

619
00:23:32,617 --> 00:23:33,986
- What can it be? - It was very popular.

620
00:23:33,986 --> 00:23:35,916
Goodness. It's driving me crazy.

621
00:23:36,656 --> 00:23:39,656
- 3 minutes and 20 seconds. - Okay.

622
00:23:40,057 --> 00:23:41,297
(What's the result of his strategy to choose the beginning part?)

623
00:23:41,297 --> 00:23:43,097
(What's the result of his strategy to choose the beginning part?)

624
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,426
- Don't you think so? - Right.

625
00:23:47,297 --> 00:23:49,037
It's right.

626
00:23:49,037 --> 00:23:51,936
(They hear the familiar music.)

627
00:23:51,936 --> 00:23:53,807
(Our guess was right.)

628
00:23:54,936 --> 00:23:56,837
(They figure out what it is as well.)

629
00:23:56,837 --> 00:23:58,747
- Goodness. - We were right.

630
00:23:58,747 --> 00:24:00,176
- I'll go. - Go ahead.

631
00:24:00,176 --> 00:24:01,376
"Temptation of Wife".

632
00:24:01,376 --> 00:24:03,476
(The answer is "Temptation of Wife".)

633
00:24:04,847 --> 00:24:08,817
(This legendary drama received 40 percent of viewer ratings.)

634
00:24:09,456 --> 00:24:13,257
(Its theme song became just as popular as the drama.)

635
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:14,726
"Temptation of Wife".

636
00:24:14,726 --> 00:24:17,527
(Sung Hoon's choice allowed them to listen to the theme song.)

637
00:24:17,527 --> 00:24:20,327
It was worth tearing the plastic wrap.

638
00:24:21,037 --> 00:24:22,466
I recognized the song right away.

639
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:23,696
Here comes the second question.

640
00:24:24,107 --> 00:24:26,436
The first question...

641
00:24:27,277 --> 00:24:29,007
- is from a movie. - All right.

642
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,706
Let's go.

643
00:24:30,706 --> 00:24:32,547
I'll play it for 10 seconds.

644
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:34,747
Here we go.

645
00:24:34,747 --> 00:24:38,946
You'll part ways with your family, so why don't you take a picture?

646
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:41,857
- Really? - Goodness.

647
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:43,216
- Let go. - Hey.

648
00:24:46,186 --> 00:24:48,757
It sounded like people...

649
00:24:48,757 --> 00:24:50,027
"Hometown Report"?

650
00:24:50,297 --> 00:24:52,027
Are you sure you didn't film nearby here?

651
00:24:52,126 --> 00:24:53,226
Is it us?

652
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:54,597
- It goes this way? - Team Ji Hyo, tell us...

653
00:24:54,597 --> 00:24:56,236
- which part you want to listen. - Okay.

654
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:00,577
You'll get a feeling if you listen to the beginning part.

655
00:25:01,007 --> 00:25:03,406
You'll get a feeling if you listen to the beginning part.

656
00:25:03,406 --> 00:25:05,007
(What?)

657
00:25:05,007 --> 00:25:06,047
Sae Ho...

658
00:25:07,146 --> 00:25:08,777
56 minutes.

659
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:11,317
- What? - You don't make sense.

660
00:25:11,317 --> 00:25:13,146
56 minutes.

661
00:25:13,956 --> 00:25:15,886
(You said differently 5 seconds ago.)

662
00:25:15,886 --> 00:25:16,886
What are you talking about?

663
00:25:16,886 --> 00:25:18,257
He said he'd listen to the beginning part.

664
00:25:18,257 --> 00:25:21,557
- Ji Hyo didn't like the idea. - What was that?

665
00:25:21,656 --> 00:25:22,956
Shouldn't we listen to the beginning part?

666
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:24,567
No, it'll be hard to know.

667
00:25:24,726 --> 00:25:26,396
Then how about 30 minutes?

668
00:25:26,497 --> 00:25:28,067
We'll go with 60 minutes and 40 seconds.

669
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:29,597
- Pardon? - 60 minutes and 40 seconds.

670
00:25:29,597 --> 00:25:31,236
60 minutes and 40 seconds.

671
00:25:31,807 --> 00:25:34,007
We'll play the movie now.

672
00:25:37,146 --> 00:25:39,807
I got a call from Jacque at dawn today.

673
00:25:40,676 --> 00:25:42,617
He's a corporal of the French army.

674
00:25:43,747 --> 00:25:45,916
He's working with his twin brother, Paul.

675
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:48,057
- It's difficult. - How are we supposed to...

676
00:25:48,557 --> 00:25:50,117
Is it illegally downloaded?

677
00:25:50,626 --> 00:25:52,126
- I heard some cracking sounds. - I know what this is.

678
00:25:54,027 --> 00:25:55,196
Five...

679
00:26:00,736 --> 00:26:03,166
I know the answer. This is...

680
00:26:03,337 --> 00:26:05,406
I know what this is.

681
00:26:05,406 --> 00:26:08,906
(Sae Ho, do you really know the answer?)

682
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:11,376
It's "Tunnel".

683
00:26:12,007 --> 00:26:13,916
- It's "Tunnel". - Be specific.

684
00:26:14,876 --> 00:26:16,976
- I don't need to spell this out. - No, but be specific.

685
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:19,847
- "Tunnel". - "Tunnel".

686
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:21,456
(It's wrong.)

687
00:26:21,656 --> 00:26:22,757
"Tunnel".

688
00:26:22,757 --> 00:26:24,087
(He made all the fuss, but it's wrong.)

689
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:26,186
Nothing's going right with you today.

690
00:26:28,726 --> 00:26:29,797
Why did she hit you?

691
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,767
I don't know. She got upset and hit me.

692
00:26:31,827 --> 00:26:33,226
(They're in a love-hate relationship.)

693
00:26:33,896 --> 00:26:35,636
- It's Kwang Soo's turn now, right? - Yes.

694
00:26:35,966 --> 00:26:37,936
I'm going to get it right for certain.

695
00:26:37,936 --> 00:26:39,666
An hour...

696
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:42,706
No, I think it's better to listen to the beginning part.

697
00:26:42,906 --> 00:26:45,577
I figured it out when I heard the part which they first played for us.

698
00:26:45,577 --> 00:26:47,317
- Is that right? - You need to focus on dialogues.

699
00:26:47,317 --> 00:26:48,916
- Do you know what it is? - Come on.

700
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:50,446
I'll get it right for certain when my turn comes.

701
00:26:51,117 --> 00:26:53,186
- 10 minutes. - 10 minutes?

702
00:26:53,186 --> 00:26:55,386
I'll play it until 10 minutes 10 seconds.

703
00:26:56,017 --> 00:26:57,686
We'll play the movie now.

704
00:26:57,986 --> 00:27:01,997
I saw a photo of him holding heads in both of his hands.

705
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:03,357
Goodness.

706
00:27:03,426 --> 00:27:06,126
Everyone has done that in Vietnam.

707
00:27:07,097 --> 00:27:08,097
Have you seen me?

708
00:27:09,936 --> 00:27:13,367
- "Vietnam"? - Was it the character's name?

709
00:27:14,607 --> 00:27:15,837
Which one is it?

710
00:27:16,507 --> 00:27:18,777
(It's "Ode to My Father".)

711
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:21,146
(I'm a genius.)

712
00:27:21,146 --> 00:27:22,247
Go, Se Chan.

713
00:27:22,617 --> 00:27:24,716
I was accurate.

714
00:27:25,117 --> 00:27:26,287
I got it.

715
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:27,886
I have no idea.

716
00:27:27,886 --> 00:27:29,986
- You don't know the answer. - What is he holding?

717
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:32,956
- 4, 3. - "Silmido".

718
00:27:34,357 --> 00:27:35,357
(Wrong answer)

719
00:27:35,597 --> 00:27:37,027
(This is the answer.)

720
00:27:38,097 --> 00:27:41,636
I select 1 hour 20 minutes 30 seconds.

721
00:27:41,636 --> 00:27:44,067
1 hour 20 minutes 30 seconds.

722
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:45,666
We'll play the movie now.

723
00:27:46,037 --> 00:27:47,577
Commander, are you okay?

724
00:27:49,037 --> 00:27:50,077
Commander!

725
00:27:50,077 --> 00:27:55,317
(Various people screaming)

726
00:27:55,976 --> 00:27:57,817
- It's confusing. - Why is there a commander?

727
00:27:57,817 --> 00:27:59,517
- Why is there a commander? - It's confusing.

728
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,716
It's what the director wanted.

729
00:28:01,716 --> 00:28:02,716
(The answer is obvious.)

730
00:28:03,486 --> 00:28:04,926
Why do you ask that?

731
00:28:04,926 --> 00:28:06,027
- He looks confused. - Three.

732
00:28:06,626 --> 00:28:09,126
- Two. - "Ode to My Father".

733
00:28:09,126 --> 00:28:13,426
(Se Chan's answer is the same as Sae Ho's.)

734
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:16,236
(Will their answer be correct?)

735
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,236
"Ode to My Father"?

736
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:19,037
- It's wrong. - I knew it.

737
00:28:19,107 --> 00:28:20,107
"Ode to My Father"?

738
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:21,307
(It's not correct.)

739
00:28:21,307 --> 00:28:24,047
Gosh, Sae Ho is wrong all the time.

740
00:28:24,047 --> 00:28:25,706
(She's speechless.)

741
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:26,876
Come on, Sae Ho.

742
00:28:26,876 --> 00:28:28,416
(I'm wrong again.)

743
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,416
Gosh.

744
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:32,017
He's driving me crazy.

745
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:34,517
I must answer correctly.

746
00:28:37,226 --> 00:28:38,327
(Whispering)

747
00:28:39,587 --> 00:28:40,797
(Oh, that's right.)

748
00:28:40,797 --> 00:28:41,926
Isn't it right?

749
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:44,827
(She's desperate to answer.)

750
00:28:45,126 --> 00:28:48,567
I select 49 minutes 20 seconds.

751
00:28:48,636 --> 00:28:50,067
49 minutes 20 seconds.

752
00:28:50,067 --> 00:28:52,307
We'll play the movie now.

753
00:28:55,136 --> 00:28:56,736
They're trying to buy time.

754
00:28:56,906 --> 00:28:58,406
Have you contacted the headquarters?

755
00:28:58,577 --> 00:29:00,817
- No. - I'm 100 percent sure.

756
00:29:00,847 --> 00:29:01,876
It's not up yet.

757
00:29:03,077 --> 00:29:05,446
I know the answer.

758
00:29:06,216 --> 00:29:08,517
(Everyone recognizes his voice.)

759
00:29:08,517 --> 00:29:09,886
(It's Jae Seok and Sun Mi's turn to answer.)

760
00:29:09,886 --> 00:29:10,886
Wait.

761
00:29:10,886 --> 00:29:12,486
- You may answer. - It's...

762
00:29:12,486 --> 00:29:13,726
(It was an important clue.)

763
00:29:13,726 --> 00:29:18,226
(Did Jae Seok recognize which movie it is?)

764
00:29:19,196 --> 00:29:21,896
It's "R-Point".

765
00:29:21,896 --> 00:29:23,436
(Sigh)

766
00:29:23,436 --> 00:29:25,037
(More sighing)

767
00:29:25,537 --> 00:29:27,406
("R-Point" is correct.)

768
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:30,176
- I knew it. - Goodness.

769
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:31,476
(It was released in 2004.)

770
00:29:31,476 --> 00:29:34,976
(It's a horror movie that everyone still talks about.)

771
00:29:34,976 --> 00:29:37,517
(The director needed a commander.)

772
00:29:37,517 --> 00:29:42,057
(It starred Son Byeong Ho and Kam Woo Sung.)

773
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:43,317
It was "R-Point".

774
00:29:44,027 --> 00:29:45,527
(Jae Seok and Sun Mi guess correctly.)

775
00:29:45,527 --> 00:29:46,527
It was "R-Point".

776
00:29:46,527 --> 00:29:47,696
(We did it.)

777
00:29:48,527 --> 00:29:50,896
(Things aren't going well for us.)

778
00:29:51,896 --> 00:29:54,736
Kwang Soo is in 1st place for answering 4 questions.

779
00:29:54,736 --> 00:29:56,097
Didn't they finish playing?

780
00:29:56,236 --> 00:29:58,307
- They're in first place. - We'll win.

781
00:29:59,136 --> 00:30:00,607
Next mission is...

782
00:30:00,876 --> 00:30:02,706
push-ups.

783
00:30:02,837 --> 00:30:07,007
The female member must do 5 push-ups in 10 seconds...

784
00:30:07,047 --> 00:30:08,847
to clear the mission.

785
00:30:08,847 --> 00:30:09,876
The female member?

786
00:30:10,077 --> 00:30:12,017
Many of them work out.

787
00:30:12,517 --> 00:30:13,617
Here's the next movie.

788
00:30:14,617 --> 00:30:16,357
We'll play the movie now.

789
00:30:16,456 --> 00:30:17,486
(A random part plays.)

790
00:30:17,486 --> 00:30:19,257
What brings you here? Wait.

791
00:30:19,257 --> 00:30:20,956
Hey, what's that sound?

792
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,057
What sound?

793
00:30:22,527 --> 00:30:24,067
Someone talking in his sleep?

794
00:30:24,067 --> 00:30:26,426
I heard a girl's voice. What was it?

795
00:30:26,597 --> 00:30:28,396
A girl's voice? Really?

796
00:30:29,736 --> 00:30:30,736
Really?

797
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,037
(I know the answer.)

798
00:30:32,037 --> 00:30:33,037
Buzzer.

799
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,507
Let's go, Seung Un.

800
00:30:37,507 --> 00:30:40,047
No, we should listen more.

801
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:42,946
You have 10 seconds to do 5 push-ups.

802
00:30:42,946 --> 00:30:44,146
- You know the answer? - Do it.

803
00:30:44,146 --> 00:30:45,146
- Get ready. - Just do it.

804
00:30:45,146 --> 00:30:47,117
- Set. - I can't do five.

805
00:30:47,117 --> 00:30:48,117
Start.

806
00:30:48,117 --> 00:30:49,956
(What should I do?)

807
00:30:51,027 --> 00:30:54,126
1, 2, 3.

808
00:30:54,797 --> 00:30:55,797
Four.

809
00:30:56,327 --> 00:30:57,327
She can do it.

810
00:30:57,327 --> 00:30:58,327
(Ji Hyo is amazing.)

811
00:30:58,327 --> 00:30:59,597
1, 2.

812
00:30:59,597 --> 00:31:02,597
(Her posture is perfect.)

813
00:31:03,267 --> 00:31:04,837
- She did five. - Success.

814
00:31:04,837 --> 00:31:05,837
Great.

815
00:31:05,837 --> 00:31:07,136
(She did 5 perfect push-ups in 10 seconds.)

816
00:31:07,136 --> 00:31:09,406
(You must give the right answer.)

817
00:31:10,107 --> 00:31:13,146
It sounds somewhat familiar.

818
00:31:13,577 --> 00:31:15,676
22 minutes 10 seconds.

819
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,817
22 minutes 10 seconds.

820
00:31:18,986 --> 00:31:20,017
We'll play the movie now.

821
00:31:21,517 --> 00:31:22,686
Hey, you.

822
00:31:22,686 --> 00:31:23,827
Don't come in.

823
00:31:25,587 --> 00:31:26,787
You punks.

824
00:31:26,787 --> 00:31:29,757
- I'll throw you against the wall. - Goodness.

825
00:31:29,997 --> 00:31:31,166
Darn it.

826
00:31:32,696 --> 00:31:35,597
(Seung Un found out the answer again.)

827
00:31:36,736 --> 00:31:37,807
"Throw you against"?

828
00:31:38,507 --> 00:31:39,636
What is it?

829
00:31:40,406 --> 00:31:42,476
Sae Ho was serious when he told me that...

830
00:31:42,476 --> 00:31:44,747
he'll pay me 1,000 dollars for the right answer.

831
00:31:45,047 --> 00:31:47,007
- It's true. - Come on, Sae Ho.

832
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:48,017
He was being serious.

833
00:31:48,017 --> 00:31:49,876
- Are you trying to brag? - That's what he said.

834
00:31:50,017 --> 00:31:51,347
I was trying to help him.

835
00:31:51,347 --> 00:31:55,317
He's not lying. This is what Kwang Soo whispered to Sae Ho.

836
00:31:55,317 --> 00:31:57,126
- He said it's "Mulberry". - He said it's "Mulberry".

837
00:31:57,787 --> 00:31:59,186
- Kwang Soo. - Five minutes.

838
00:31:59,226 --> 00:32:01,327
- 1 hour 5 minutes 20 seconds. - I'll give you 1,000 dollars.

839
00:32:01,327 --> 00:32:02,527
1,000 dollars.

840
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:05,926
(He tries to make a deal.)

841
00:32:06,267 --> 00:32:09,097
(Kwang Soo gave him the wrong answer.)

842
00:32:10,436 --> 00:32:12,337
He tried to take 1,000 dollars for "Mulberry".

843
00:32:12,337 --> 00:32:13,736
- He said "Mulberry". - What's the answer?

844
00:32:14,136 --> 00:32:15,837
- Wait a minute. - Wait.

845
00:32:15,837 --> 00:32:16,876
You have three seconds.

846
00:32:17,476 --> 00:32:19,406
- What's the question? - Three.

847
00:32:19,406 --> 00:32:22,517
- Do we guess the movie title? - Sae Ho.

848
00:32:22,517 --> 00:32:25,587
(What are we doing right now?)

849
00:32:25,587 --> 00:32:27,686
We've been playing for so long.

850
00:32:28,216 --> 00:32:29,716
- He says he doesn't know. - One.

851
00:32:30,257 --> 00:32:31,287
Time is up.

852
00:32:32,486 --> 00:32:34,527
- Is it... - I know.

853
00:32:34,527 --> 00:32:36,626
- Think carefully. - Here's my answer.

854
00:32:36,626 --> 00:32:39,367
I'll say the answer in a stylish way.

855
00:32:39,527 --> 00:32:40,837
The answer is...

856
00:32:40,896 --> 00:32:43,236
(Sae Ho has been mostly incorrect. Is he confident this time?)

857
00:32:43,236 --> 00:32:44,807
It has three syllables.

858
00:32:46,236 --> 00:32:47,607
(Under pressure,)

859
00:32:47,607 --> 00:32:49,406
(Sae Ho comes up with an answer.)

860
00:32:49,406 --> 00:32:52,706
(What is his three-syllable answer?)

861
00:32:52,876 --> 00:32:55,716
It's "The Attorney".

862
00:32:55,946 --> 00:32:57,287
Oh Dal Su starred in it.

863
00:32:58,247 --> 00:32:59,587
We know the answer.

864
00:32:59,587 --> 00:33:00,787
Oh Dal Su starred in it.

865
00:33:01,787 --> 00:33:04,226
Oh Dal Su starred in many movies.

866
00:33:04,226 --> 00:33:05,527
He's in many movies.

867
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:07,097
He really is.

868
00:33:07,226 --> 00:33:08,827
I told you to think carefully.

869
00:33:08,827 --> 00:33:10,156
I had to say something.

870
00:33:10,527 --> 00:33:12,267
Why are you scolding me?

871
00:33:12,267 --> 00:33:14,067
- Ji Hyo. - Goodness.

872
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:15,466
1 hour 10 seconds.

873
00:33:15,867 --> 00:33:17,436
1 hour 10 seconds.

874
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,406
That's a good time.

875
00:33:19,767 --> 00:33:21,607
Play movie.

876
00:33:24,507 --> 00:33:29,176
- Leave it alone. - It's Lee Yae Seung.

877
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:30,617
He says Yae Seung when he sees boxes.

878
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:31,617
I know the answer.

879
00:33:31,617 --> 00:33:34,216
(An inarticulate voice)

880
00:33:34,216 --> 00:33:35,257
(Yae Seung)

881
00:33:35,257 --> 00:33:36,357
- I know the answer. - It's obvious.

882
00:33:36,357 --> 00:33:39,587
(It's Oh Dal Su's voice.)

883
00:33:39,587 --> 00:33:40,597
It's "Miracle in Cell No. 7".

884
00:33:41,527 --> 00:33:43,297
They got lucky.

885
00:33:44,626 --> 00:33:45,896
Yae Seung made it obvious.

886
00:33:46,097 --> 00:33:48,166
He suddenly said Yae Seung.

887
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:50,097
- That made it obvious. - It gave the answer.

888
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:52,537
- I got goosebumps. - 1 hour 10 seconds...

889
00:33:52,537 --> 00:33:54,037
was a good time.

890
00:33:54,676 --> 00:33:58,406
("Miracle in Cell No. 7" is a popular family movie.)

891
00:33:58,406 --> 00:34:02,416
(Thanks to Yae Seung, Kwang Soo gets the right answer.)

892
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:06,117
Kwang Soo and Seung Un get a Korean table d'hote meal...

893
00:34:06,117 --> 00:34:07,956
and mission money of 10 dollars.

894
00:34:08,716 --> 00:34:11,227
The couple that placed second...

895
00:34:11,227 --> 00:34:13,526
gets a Korean table d'hote meal.

896
00:34:13,856 --> 00:34:14,926
That's good enough.

897
00:34:15,256 --> 00:34:17,227
Sung Hoon and So Min placed first.

898
00:34:17,227 --> 00:34:19,767
- Jong Kook and Kei placed second. - Okay.

899
00:34:20,597 --> 00:34:21,897
Thank you.

900
00:34:21,897 --> 00:34:22,897
(They win mission money.)

901
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:25,207
Goodness.

902
00:34:25,207 --> 00:34:26,537
Are they stone pots?

903
00:34:26,707 --> 00:34:30,207
Gosh, this is too much.

904
00:34:30,207 --> 00:34:31,347
Is this galbi?

905
00:34:31,347 --> 00:34:32,347
(It's a very fancy meal.)

906
00:34:32,707 --> 00:34:34,917
- It looks delicious. - It seems healthy.

907
00:34:34,917 --> 00:34:36,347
- Eat up. - It's impressive.

908
00:34:37,486 --> 00:34:38,816
Just eating the rice would be good enough.

909
00:34:38,816 --> 00:34:40,046
(They enjoy a fancy meal.)

910
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:44,327
- Just rice would be good enough. - Let's give some to Ji Hyo.

911
00:34:44,327 --> 00:34:47,127
(They can't hear him.)

912
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,127
- Isn't that galbi? - It's such a fancy meal.

913
00:34:51,066 --> 00:34:52,926
(Even at a samgyetang restaurant,)

914
00:34:53,597 --> 00:34:55,636
(they only get to eat dried laver.)

915
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:57,667
They serve delicious dried laver.

916
00:34:58,106 --> 00:34:59,466
It's so delicious.

917
00:35:00,006 --> 00:35:01,236
It's delicious.

918
00:35:01,406 --> 00:35:02,676
It tastes great.

919
00:35:02,676 --> 00:35:04,577
This is better than samgyetang.

920
00:35:04,577 --> 00:35:05,807
It's true.

921
00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:07,877
I'm not jealous.

922
00:35:08,216 --> 00:35:10,147
Samgyetang is...

923
00:35:10,517 --> 00:35:11,716
The broth is rich.

924
00:35:11,716 --> 00:35:13,046
(Which couple will be the final winner?)

925
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:16,216
(Currently, Haha and Z Young have the highest score.)

926
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:20,457
The final mission is...

927
00:35:20,627 --> 00:35:23,057
Roulette Name Tag Elimination.

928
00:35:23,057 --> 00:35:24,227
(Roulette Name Tag Elimination)

929
00:35:24,227 --> 00:35:25,327
(Name Tag Elimination?)

930
00:35:25,327 --> 00:35:26,497
Is it Name Tag Elimination?

931
00:35:26,497 --> 00:35:28,136
(Roulette Name Tag Elimination?)

932
00:35:28,136 --> 00:35:29,566
It's Name Tag Elimination.

933
00:35:29,736 --> 00:35:33,667
It's Target Name Tag Elimination with a time limit of 30 minutes.

934
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:37,147
(Target Name Tag Elimination)

935
00:35:37,147 --> 00:35:38,877
- Gosh. - Do you see the roulette?

936
00:35:41,617 --> 00:35:44,086
(The members' names are written on the roulette.)

937
00:35:44,086 --> 00:35:45,147
I knew it.

938
00:35:45,986 --> 00:35:48,986
Spin the two roulettes that have your names on them...

939
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:51,557
to determine two target members.

940
00:35:52,227 --> 00:35:55,526
Those whose name tags get eliminated will be reset on the roulette.

941
00:35:55,526 --> 00:35:58,066
New target members will be announced through the speakers.

942
00:35:58,267 --> 00:35:59,627
This is scary.

943
00:35:59,627 --> 00:36:02,836
The reward will be 30 dollars.

944
00:36:03,437 --> 00:36:05,167
Turning the tables is possible.

945
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:06,307
(I won't miss this chance.)

946
00:36:06,307 --> 00:36:07,307
Gosh.

947
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:11,176
The couple to eliminate the target's name tags gets rewarded.

948
00:36:11,577 --> 00:36:13,776
You may choose to exchange...

949
00:36:13,776 --> 00:36:15,716
the ball that the target members have.

950
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:18,486
(Exchanging the ball with target members is possible.)

951
00:36:18,486 --> 00:36:21,287
However, you may not check what's inside the ball.

952
00:36:21,486 --> 00:36:24,727
If the target member and his partner press buttons...

953
00:36:24,727 --> 00:36:26,986
before their name tags get eliminated,

954
00:36:27,426 --> 00:36:30,727
the roulettes will spin and change the target members.

955
00:36:30,727 --> 00:36:34,736
(If they find the reset button, the target member changes.)

956
00:36:34,736 --> 00:36:35,736
Okay.

957
00:36:36,397 --> 00:36:39,606
The winning couple's choice of destination will be on the roulette.

958
00:36:39,836 --> 00:36:43,336
They may purchase name tags with the money they win.

959
00:36:44,147 --> 00:36:46,977
It's not easy.

960
00:36:47,716 --> 00:36:51,017
Please go to your assigned places.

961
00:36:51,017 --> 00:36:53,046
- It's not easy. - We can do it.

962
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:59,426
(Who will have the honor of winning the race?)

963
00:36:59,586 --> 00:37:02,426
First off, as long as they don't target us,

964
00:37:03,026 --> 00:37:04,267
we should take off the name tags.

965
00:37:04,267 --> 00:37:07,097
Let's remove the name tags everyone is targeting and earn 30 dollars.

966
00:37:07,236 --> 00:37:08,636
- Let's get the reward. - Yes, we should.

967
00:37:08,696 --> 00:37:11,437
Hopefully, we won't be selected, and we'll only remove the name tags.

968
00:37:12,037 --> 00:37:13,336
That's the best scenario.

969
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:17,546
If one of us is the target, the other one should run.

970
00:37:17,546 --> 00:37:18,977
That's a good way to go about this.

971
00:37:18,977 --> 00:37:21,247
I wouldn't say we'd be running away from them.

972
00:37:21,247 --> 00:37:22,917
We have to find the button.

973
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:25,917
- Right. We should find the button. - We have to search the area for it.

974
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:27,617
We should be running while we keep an eye for it.

975
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:31,586
Sae Ho, I'm counting on your luck today.

976
00:37:31,586 --> 00:37:33,627
Ji Hyo, after the shoot,

977
00:37:33,756 --> 00:37:35,227
I'll make sure you tell me...

978
00:37:35,356 --> 00:37:37,526
that you will treat me to a meal.

979
00:37:37,867 --> 00:37:38,997
I'll make you want to buy me a meal.

980
00:37:38,997 --> 00:37:40,066
- Are you sure? - Yes.

981
00:37:40,066 --> 00:37:41,336
If not,

982
00:37:41,336 --> 00:37:42,796
as soon as the shoot ends,

983
00:37:42,796 --> 00:37:44,906
(If not, as soon as the shot ends,)

984
00:37:44,906 --> 00:37:46,466
you'll be dead meat.

985
00:37:46,466 --> 00:37:47,736
I'm serious. Just wait.

986
00:37:48,037 --> 00:37:49,636
You'll be dead meat.

987
00:37:50,847 --> 00:37:52,977
(Sae Ho might have to put his life on the line for this race.)

988
00:37:52,977 --> 00:37:55,877
Depending on how you play today,

989
00:37:55,877 --> 00:37:57,946
I might end up here if things go south.

990
00:37:57,946 --> 00:37:59,446
(Ji Hyo chose hammocking in Indonesia.)

991
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:00,557
That must be so fun.

992
00:38:00,557 --> 00:38:02,356
(You're going to be in a hammock?)

993
00:38:02,457 --> 00:38:04,356
Ji Hyo, where else would you have the chance to experience it?

994
00:38:04,356 --> 00:38:06,156
(Gosh, Sae Ho. You haven't come to your senses yet.)

995
00:38:06,156 --> 00:38:07,256
Don't you think so?

996
00:38:07,256 --> 00:38:09,227
(Whispering)

997
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:14,466
I think my ear is bleeding.

998
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,537
(Figuring out others' destinations is the key.)

999
00:38:16,537 --> 00:38:18,506
- Should we each have a ball? - Shall we?

1000
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:20,006
(Figuring out others' destinations is the key.)

1001
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,577
- It's not really necessary though. - We'll just do it.

1002
00:38:21,577 --> 00:38:23,176
- We earned a lot of money. - We don't have any good ones.

1003
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,676
(They have balls of 2 destinations the crew picked.)

1004
00:38:26,477 --> 00:38:29,176
- I have a blue ball. - Okay.

1005
00:38:29,577 --> 00:38:32,287
I chose Copper Canyon.

1006
00:38:32,287 --> 00:38:34,256
(1 destination of the members and 1 destination of the crew)

1007
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,486
I knew it. You're a princess from Rome.

1008
00:38:36,986 --> 00:38:38,656
Ta-da.

1009
00:38:38,656 --> 00:38:41,156
(They chose 2 destinations of the members.)

1010
00:38:41,156 --> 00:38:42,457
(Rome, Italy, and Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia)

1011
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:45,926
I chose Alaska and a chance to see the aurora.

1012
00:38:45,926 --> 00:38:47,767
I chose Australia.

1013
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:50,437
(Se Chan and Elijah, who are ranked 3rd, chose two blue balls.)

1014
00:38:51,207 --> 00:38:53,937
- I'm going to be hiding. - In where?

1015
00:38:54,136 --> 00:38:56,406
You should just find the button and press it for me.

1016
00:38:56,406 --> 00:38:58,046
If I'm selected, I'll be hiding.

1017
00:38:58,207 --> 00:38:59,977
If you're picked, you should hide.

1018
00:38:59,977 --> 00:39:01,477
That's a great idea. Let's do that.

1019
00:39:01,477 --> 00:39:02,477
(Let's stay 1st in the race.)

1020
00:39:02,977 --> 00:39:05,046
Sun Mi, how could you pick that one?

1021
00:39:05,147 --> 00:39:06,417
You chose Indonesia...

1022
00:39:06,747 --> 00:39:08,356
- The volcano tour. - and the volcano tour.

1023
00:39:08,356 --> 00:39:13,156
(They're 6th in the race, and Sun Mi chose the volcano tour.)

1024
00:39:13,156 --> 00:39:14,827
Why do bad things always happen to us?

1025
00:39:14,827 --> 00:39:16,557
(I had faith in you.)

1026
00:39:16,557 --> 00:39:18,597
Look at this. I chose...

1027
00:39:18,597 --> 00:39:21,336
the division card.

1028
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:25,136
(They're the unluckiest. They will divide the mission money by 2?)

1029
00:39:25,136 --> 00:39:26,707
This is how unlucky I am.

1030
00:39:26,707 --> 00:39:28,636
I'm tired of being the unlucky one.

1031
00:39:29,176 --> 00:39:31,247
- We can give that to someone else. - That's true.

1032
00:39:31,546 --> 00:39:34,676
- I can just give mine to anyone. - Exactly.

1033
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:35,676
(I must get rid of this first.)

1034
00:39:36,347 --> 00:39:37,586
I didn't know...

1035
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:39,417
- Right. - there's only one of this.

1036
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:41,156
I think this is the best one of all.

1037
00:39:41,156 --> 00:39:44,827
I really thought that there were more multiplication cards.

1038
00:39:45,386 --> 00:39:47,097
(He might've used up all his luck he has left this year.)

1039
00:39:47,097 --> 00:39:48,557
- You should hold on to this. - No, no.

1040
00:39:48,557 --> 00:39:49,627
They'll take this away from me.

1041
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:51,526
- I'll protect you. - Okay.

1042
00:39:51,526 --> 00:39:55,767
Hold on. You're not going to switch our partners, right?

1043
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:57,066
No, we won't.

1044
00:39:57,066 --> 00:39:58,506
- I doubt it. - I mean...

1045
00:39:58,506 --> 00:39:59,867
- That wouldn't happen. - I'm sorry.

1046
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:01,006
I'm so sorry.

1047
00:40:02,377 --> 00:40:05,006
(They chose a destination of the crew and multiplication card.)

1048
00:40:05,006 --> 00:40:08,747
(They chose a destination of the crew and multiplication card.)

1049
00:40:09,847 --> 00:40:13,586
(Current ranking on each couple's mission fee)

1050
00:40:13,586 --> 00:40:16,586
(Haha and Z Young chose Bow River and Cage of Death.)

1051
00:40:16,586 --> 00:40:18,656
Let the race begin.

1052
00:40:19,656 --> 00:40:21,756
The targets will be selected.

1053
00:40:22,627 --> 00:40:25,566
Two roulettes for male and female members will be spun.

1054
00:40:25,997 --> 00:40:28,167
Two members will be chosen as the targets.

1055
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:30,867
(It's time to select the first target.)

1056
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:37,506
(Which 2 members will be selected by the roulettes?)

1057
00:40:39,176 --> 00:40:45,316
(The male member the roulette has picked is...)

1058
00:40:45,316 --> 00:40:48,117
(Se Chan.)

1059
00:40:48,117 --> 00:40:53,997
(The female member the roulette has picked is...)

1060
00:40:53,997 --> 00:40:56,957
(Sol Bi.)

1061
00:40:56,957 --> 00:41:00,227
(The targets have been selected.)

1062
00:41:00,227 --> 00:41:03,066
The male target is Yang Se Chan.

1063
00:41:03,066 --> 00:41:06,006
(The first male target is Se Chan.)

1064
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:08,236
- I should be on the run then. - Let the race begin.

1065
00:41:08,707 --> 00:41:11,207
The female target is Sol Bi.

1066
00:41:11,606 --> 00:41:13,377
- Let the race begin. - What do I do?

1067
00:41:13,747 --> 00:41:18,316
The male target is Yang Se Chan. The female target is Sol Bi.

1068
00:41:18,316 --> 00:41:19,417
- Okay. - Let's go.

1069
00:41:19,417 --> 00:41:21,156
(The race to remove the targets' name tags has started.)

1070
00:41:21,156 --> 00:41:22,156
Let's hurry.

1071
00:41:22,156 --> 00:41:25,457
(The race to remove the targets' name tags has started.)

1072
00:41:25,457 --> 00:41:27,156
We should just catch one. I saw one of them over there.

1073
00:41:27,156 --> 00:41:28,957
(I'll just catch one of the two targets.)

1074
00:41:29,827 --> 00:41:31,066
- Let the race begin. - Why does it have to be you?

1075
00:41:31,296 --> 00:41:32,367
Let's find the button.

1076
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:33,767
(Their goal is to reset the targets.)

1077
00:41:33,767 --> 00:41:35,236
Come on. Go! Run.

1078
00:41:36,696 --> 00:41:37,707
What do we do?

1079
00:41:37,707 --> 00:41:41,836
(The couples with targeted member must find the reset button quickly.)

1080
00:41:41,836 --> 00:41:43,236
- There are stairs, right? - Yes.

1081
00:41:44,406 --> 00:41:45,776
- They're coming. - Oh, no.

1082
00:41:45,977 --> 00:41:47,006
Find it.

1083
00:41:48,176 --> 00:41:49,316
We must get that button.

1084
00:41:49,977 --> 00:41:51,486
Where would the button be?

1085
00:41:51,787 --> 00:41:53,386
Don't you think it would be downstairs? Hey!

1086
00:41:58,486 --> 00:41:59,656
Run!

1087
00:41:59,656 --> 00:42:00,727
(Hunters are spotted ahead.)

1088
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:02,227
(Run, Sol Bi. Run!)

1089
00:42:02,227 --> 00:42:03,526
You shouldn't run slowly.

1090
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:05,267
- Hurry! - What do we do?

1091
00:42:05,267 --> 00:42:07,097
- Hey, Sol Bi. Run! - They're so fast.

1092
00:42:07,097 --> 00:42:08,836
(If they remove Sol Bi's name tag, they'll receive 30 dollars.)

1093
00:42:08,836 --> 00:42:10,267
Go to the right. You're too slow. We have no choice.

1094
00:42:10,406 --> 00:42:11,606
Why are you so slow?

1095
00:42:13,307 --> 00:42:15,977
(This wanted member takes shelter in the elevator.)

1096
00:42:15,977 --> 00:42:19,707
(Kwang Soo finds the target, Sol Bi.)

1097
00:42:19,707 --> 00:42:21,046
- Go down, Sol Bi. - No, no!

1098
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:23,446
- No, get away from me. - Sol Bi!

1099
00:42:23,716 --> 00:42:25,247
- Sol Bi! - No, don't do it.

1100
00:42:25,886 --> 00:42:27,856
- Come. Take the stairs. - No, I can't.

1101
00:42:28,256 --> 00:42:29,656
- Sol Bi, come out of there. - I can't.

1102
00:42:29,656 --> 00:42:31,026
- I'm sorry. - This won't work.

1103
00:42:31,026 --> 00:42:32,787
- Run away from us. - Help me. Hurry.

1104
00:42:32,787 --> 00:42:33,997
It's just that we don't have money.

1105
00:42:34,227 --> 00:42:35,256
- No. - Wait.

1106
00:42:35,256 --> 00:42:36,457
(The door just closed?)

1107
00:42:36,457 --> 00:42:38,196
- I'm sorry. - The cameraman didn't get in.

1108
00:42:39,227 --> 00:42:40,537
The cameraman didn't get in the elevator.

1109
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,336
(The cameraman is feeling lost.)

1110
00:42:42,336 --> 00:42:44,106
I don't have nothing to film.

1111
00:42:44,707 --> 00:42:46,037
They stopped at the eighth floor.

1112
00:42:47,707 --> 00:42:51,406
(The cameraman rushes down to the 8th floor.)

1113
00:42:52,676 --> 00:42:54,117
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok and Sun Mi are looking for Se Chan.)

1114
00:42:54,117 --> 00:42:55,117
Where is he?

1115
00:42:56,316 --> 00:42:57,446
Hey.

1116
00:42:58,917 --> 00:43:03,417
(They find Sol Bi who was fighting her battle without a camera.)

1117
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:04,586
No, Sol Bi!

1118
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,457
- Go find Se Chan. - Go after Se Chan, not me.

1119
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:09,356
- Get the name tag! - Why are all of you after me?

1120
00:43:09,997 --> 00:43:11,566
(Se Chan is looking for the reset button.)

1121
00:43:11,566 --> 00:43:12,667
Let's find the button.

1122
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:14,767
(Se Chan is a target like Sol Bi, but isn't sharing the same trouble.)

1123
00:43:14,767 --> 00:43:15,767
(I can't believe he's a target.)

1124
00:43:15,767 --> 00:43:18,066
I guess there's no button on the seventh floor.

1125
00:43:18,066 --> 00:43:19,767
"How Is This Possible"?

1126
00:43:19,767 --> 00:43:22,877
(Oh, my. Se Chan is the target. How is this possible?)

1127
00:43:22,877 --> 00:43:24,546
(She looks excited with everything going on.)

1128
00:43:25,747 --> 00:43:28,316
(How on earth can this happen?)

1129
00:43:28,747 --> 00:43:31,187
- Let go of her! - Gosh, she's so strong!

1130
00:43:31,886 --> 00:43:33,647
- Z Young got it. - She got the name tag!

1131
00:43:33,647 --> 00:43:35,457
(In the end, Z Young removes her name tag.)

1132
00:43:35,457 --> 00:43:37,327
(Z Young is truly the best fighter.)

1133
00:43:37,327 --> 00:43:38,356
You're awesome.

1134
00:43:38,356 --> 00:43:40,426
Who got the name tag?

1135
00:43:40,426 --> 00:43:43,966
(Sol Bi is eliminated, and Haha and Z Young stay in the lead.)

1136
00:43:44,727 --> 00:43:46,767
I have to go find Se Chan now.

1137
00:43:47,136 --> 00:43:49,196
Sun Mi, we don't have time to rest. We have to find Se Chan.

1138
00:43:49,196 --> 00:43:50,736
(They earn a chance to switch the ball as well.)

1139
00:43:50,736 --> 00:43:52,406
- You're unbelievable. - Seriously.

1140
00:43:52,636 --> 00:43:53,877
Is there a ball you want to switch with?

1141
00:43:53,877 --> 00:43:55,877
The ball you have...

1142
00:43:56,636 --> 00:44:02,046
(Haha and Z Young have red balls. Seok Jin and Sol Bi have blue ones.)

1143
00:44:04,216 --> 00:44:07,957
- The ball you have... Let's switch. - Switch the ball.

1144
00:44:07,957 --> 00:44:08,957
Let's switch.

1145
00:44:08,957 --> 00:44:12,127
- Come on. Give some thought to it. - No, ours isn't that bad either.

1146
00:44:12,426 --> 00:44:14,227
- Ours isn't that good. - Okay, fine.

1147
00:44:14,227 --> 00:44:15,597
- Are we changing them now? - Our isn't much either.

1148
00:44:17,066 --> 00:44:21,097
The roulette will be spun to select a new target.

1149
00:44:21,097 --> 00:44:24,236
(The roulette for female members is spinning again.)

1150
00:44:24,236 --> 00:44:26,466
We have to find the button first. I'm serious.

1151
00:44:26,937 --> 00:44:28,276
We should run first, Jong Kook.

1152
00:44:28,276 --> 00:44:31,406
(Who will be the next female target?)

1153
00:44:33,307 --> 00:44:34,617
(The new target is Elijah.)

1154
00:44:34,617 --> 00:44:37,986
The new target is Elijah.

1155
00:44:38,986 --> 00:44:42,287
The new target is Elijah.

1156
00:44:42,856 --> 00:44:44,026
It's you?

1157
00:44:44,026 --> 00:44:45,856
(So both of us are the targets?)

1158
00:44:45,856 --> 00:44:48,127
- Hold on. - We are both the targets.

1159
00:44:48,127 --> 00:44:50,057
Why are you doing this to us?

1160
00:44:50,057 --> 00:44:55,736
(Everyone is targeting Se Chan and Elijah.)

1161
00:44:55,736 --> 00:44:59,736
- If we catch both, it'll be great. - Exactly.

1162
00:45:00,006 --> 00:45:02,037
Let's look for them as we make our way down.

1163
00:45:02,037 --> 00:45:03,037
(Hey, 60 dollars. Where are you hiding?)

1164
00:45:03,037 --> 00:45:04,577
- They must be scared. - They'd better.

1165
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,406
- We should catch them together. - Okay. I'm in.

1166
00:45:06,506 --> 00:45:08,917
Sol Bi and I can take down Elijah easily.

1167
00:45:09,276 --> 00:45:11,946
- She's an easy target. - She's done.

1168
00:45:11,946 --> 00:45:16,486
(It's a chance to earn a lot of money. Everyone starts hunting.)

1169
00:45:17,426 --> 00:45:21,127
(Cautious)

1170
00:45:21,356 --> 00:45:24,097
- On which floor were we? - We were on the third floor.

1171
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:25,327
- Really? - We moved up two floors now.

1172
00:45:25,327 --> 00:45:27,636
- Let's go to the sixth floor. - Gosh, this is so tiring.

1173
00:45:28,397 --> 00:45:29,667
- Sixth floor. - The stairs...

1174
00:45:30,196 --> 00:45:32,537
(The door flings open.)

1175
00:45:32,537 --> 00:45:33,707
I found them!

1176
00:45:33,707 --> 00:45:34,736
They're right here!

1177
00:45:34,736 --> 00:45:35,776
(The wanted couple is spotted.)

1178
00:45:36,707 --> 00:45:37,776
They're right here!

1179
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,506
(Screaming)

1180
00:45:40,307 --> 00:45:42,017
- We got her. - No!

1181
00:45:42,017 --> 00:45:43,546
- Stop! - Seok Jin, get her name tag.

1182
00:45:44,316 --> 00:45:46,187
(I'm sorry. I must save myself.)

1183
00:45:46,187 --> 00:45:47,617
You're hurting me.

1184
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,316
(Taking off)

1185
00:45:49,316 --> 00:45:50,486
I'm sorry.

1186
00:45:50,486 --> 00:45:52,957
(They removed Elijah's name tag!)

1187
00:45:52,957 --> 00:45:54,156
(She's a mess.)

1188
00:45:55,796 --> 00:45:57,327
I'm such a coward.

1189
00:45:58,267 --> 00:45:59,526
I must reset this.

1190
00:45:59,526 --> 00:46:00,767
(Elijah is eliminated, and Seok Jin and Sol Bi gain 30 dollars.)

1191
00:46:00,767 --> 00:46:02,736
- My ball? - Yes.

1192
00:46:02,736 --> 00:46:04,167
We have to change my ball.

1193
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:06,167
(The winner's dilemma is whether to change the ball or not.)

1194
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:07,736
If that's the case, we won't switch.

1195
00:46:07,736 --> 00:46:08,977
(My ball is a good one.)

1196
00:46:08,977 --> 00:46:10,136
(They are 2nd in the race now.)

1197
00:46:10,136 --> 00:46:13,676
The roulette will be spun to select a new target.

1198
00:46:13,676 --> 00:46:20,687
(Who will be the next female target?)

1199
00:46:23,586 --> 00:46:26,627
The new target is Z Young.

1200
00:46:26,627 --> 00:46:28,526
(Z Young is the new target.)

1201
00:46:28,526 --> 00:46:29,696
- What? - It's me.

1202
00:46:29,856 --> 00:46:32,196
- Let the race begin. - Z Young, let's go there.

1203
00:46:32,196 --> 00:46:33,597
Hide right there.

1204
00:46:33,937 --> 00:46:35,597
- I'll be on the eighth floor. - Okay.

1205
00:46:35,597 --> 00:46:37,636
- I'll find the button. Stay here. - Okay.

1206
00:46:38,136 --> 00:46:40,066
- Can you find the button? - Yes, I can.

1207
00:46:40,066 --> 00:46:43,636
(Z Young, wait for me. I'll find you the reset button.)

1208
00:46:45,506 --> 00:46:47,617
(Haha, come back quickly.)

1209
00:46:48,176 --> 00:46:50,586
Hello, have you seen a button here?

1210
00:46:50,747 --> 00:46:52,046
- Sorry? - Have you seen a button?

1211
00:46:52,046 --> 00:46:54,287
(The male target, Se Chan, is looking for the reset button.)

1212
00:46:54,287 --> 00:46:55,486
Excuse me.

1213
00:46:55,486 --> 00:46:57,327
(The male target, Se Chan, is looking for the reset button.)

1214
00:47:00,287 --> 00:47:01,957
- I am sorry. - Elijah.

1215
00:47:01,957 --> 00:47:04,597
- I am sorry. - It's okay. Survival is the key.

1216
00:47:04,597 --> 00:47:06,597
I am sorry. I am so sorry.

1217
00:47:07,466 --> 00:47:09,696
- I couldn't stay behind. - I understand.

1218
00:47:09,696 --> 00:47:10,707
You did a good job.

1219
00:47:10,707 --> 00:47:12,566
I stayed behind on purpose...

1220
00:47:12,566 --> 00:47:14,707
- to give you time. - Thank you so much.

1221
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:17,247
- This place is too big. - I know.

1222
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,877
(Where are the targets?)

1223
00:47:22,577 --> 00:47:24,586
It's Se Chan.

1224
00:47:24,586 --> 00:47:26,187
- I will give you an entrance card. - Come this way.

1225
00:47:26,187 --> 00:47:28,356
Come this way. Hurry up.

1226
00:47:28,917 --> 00:47:31,687
(I refuse to lose him.)

1227
00:47:31,687 --> 00:47:34,057
You should go first.

1228
00:47:34,057 --> 00:47:35,957
(She is a bodyguard.)

1229
00:47:36,057 --> 00:47:39,367
(And I...)

1230
00:47:39,367 --> 00:47:42,836
(will always...)

1231
00:47:42,836 --> 00:47:45,767
(save you.)

1232
00:47:45,767 --> 00:47:47,377
No.

1233
00:47:47,377 --> 00:47:48,437
(How dare a grasshopper chase after Se Chan?)

1234
00:47:48,437 --> 00:47:50,776
(This is the power of love.)

1235
00:47:50,877 --> 00:47:51,977
No.

1236
00:47:51,977 --> 00:47:53,077
(She is pushed aside.)

1237
00:47:54,517 --> 00:47:56,816
(I must save Se Chan.)

1238
00:47:56,816 --> 00:47:58,446
(Pushed aside)

1239
00:47:59,216 --> 00:48:00,557
No.

1240
00:48:00,557 --> 00:48:03,486
(They move on as if she doesn't exist.)

1241
00:48:03,486 --> 00:48:05,856
No. No.

1242
00:48:05,856 --> 00:48:07,397
(The power of love lasted 0.01 seconds.)

1243
00:48:07,397 --> 00:48:10,097
(He doesn't know that Elijah couldn't help him.)

1244
00:48:10,097 --> 00:48:13,597
(He hides one floor above.)

1245
00:48:13,597 --> 00:48:17,037
(Can Jae Seok find Se Chan, the male target?)

1246
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:21,736
- Jae Seok. - Come here.

1247
00:48:21,736 --> 00:48:23,577
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1248
00:48:26,606 --> 00:48:28,316
(Ripping)

1249
00:48:28,316 --> 00:48:31,716
(Se Chan is out.)

1250
00:48:34,517 --> 00:48:37,356
He is here. My goodness, what is going on?

1251
00:48:37,356 --> 00:48:38,486
It's over.

1252
00:48:38,687 --> 00:48:41,597
- Se Chan. - I should have come here sooner.

1253
00:48:41,597 --> 00:48:43,557
(Sae Ho is one step behind.)

1254
00:48:44,466 --> 00:48:45,667
Where were you?

1255
00:48:45,827 --> 00:48:47,196
- Where were you? - Did you get his name tag?

1256
00:48:47,497 --> 00:48:49,397
Sae Ho. Hurry up, and come.

1257
00:48:49,636 --> 00:48:50,807
My goodness.

1258
00:48:50,807 --> 00:48:52,466
Did you get your name tag ripped off?

1259
00:48:52,466 --> 00:48:54,006
(Jae Seok and Sun Mi rank 3rd.)

1260
00:48:54,006 --> 00:48:55,276
My goodness.

1261
00:48:55,276 --> 00:48:56,807
I should exchange my ball with Se Chan's.

1262
00:48:59,506 --> 00:49:01,276
Why do bad things always happen to us?

1263
00:49:01,276 --> 00:49:04,046
(They need to divide the mission money by 2.)

1264
00:49:04,787 --> 00:49:06,886
It is decided that you won't exchange the balls.

1265
00:49:06,886 --> 00:49:08,216
It is decided.

1266
00:49:08,356 --> 00:49:11,356
You lost your chance to exchange it.

1267
00:49:11,356 --> 00:49:14,457
(You must exchange the ball at the spot.)

1268
00:49:15,127 --> 00:49:16,127
(The other target, Z Young, is hiding at the stairs.)

1269
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:18,327
It will be a disaster if you leave this place.

1270
00:49:18,566 --> 00:49:19,997
They will want to rip the name tag off of the remaining target.

1271
00:49:19,997 --> 00:49:21,136
(Don't worry, I can find the reset button.)

1272
00:49:21,136 --> 00:49:22,696
You are the remaining target. You are in danger.

1273
00:49:22,696 --> 00:49:27,377
The new target is Haha.

1274
00:49:27,377 --> 00:49:29,307
(They're both wanted now.)

1275
00:49:29,307 --> 00:49:32,207
Currently, the male target is Haha,

1276
00:49:32,207 --> 00:49:34,176
and the female target is Baek Z Young.

1277
00:49:34,176 --> 00:49:35,946
(Are both of us the targets?)

1278
00:49:35,946 --> 00:49:37,446
- This is unbelievable. - What should we do?

1279
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:39,747
We must find the reset button.

1280
00:49:39,747 --> 00:49:41,986
(The reset button is the key to their survival.)

1281
00:49:41,986 --> 00:49:43,756
I heard the sound of an emergency exit earlier.

1282
00:49:44,127 --> 00:49:45,227
Shall we go and see?

1283
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,986
I hope we run into them here.

1284
00:49:47,426 --> 00:49:49,497
- Right? - Come on out.

1285
00:49:49,497 --> 00:49:53,566
(Jong Kook and Kei start the hunt in earnest.)

1286
00:49:54,997 --> 00:50:00,307
(We must not make a sound.)

1287
00:50:00,506 --> 00:50:01,906
Didn't you hear a sound?

1288
00:50:01,906 --> 00:50:03,336
(Sung Hoon is above,)

1289
00:50:03,336 --> 00:50:06,276
(and Jong Kook is below.)

1290
00:50:06,276 --> 00:50:08,176
(We must find the reset button.)

1291
00:50:08,176 --> 00:50:09,417
Wait a minute.

1292
00:50:13,986 --> 00:50:17,687
(They find the reset button.)

1293
00:50:17,687 --> 00:50:21,926
(It's the button that changes the targets.)

1294
00:50:21,926 --> 00:50:24,196
(From now on, it's a matter of time.)

1295
00:50:24,196 --> 00:50:26,566
(What comes first? Catching the targets...)

1296
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:27,597
(or pressing the button?)

1297
00:50:27,597 --> 00:50:29,037
- Should I press it? - Press it.

1298
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:34,236
(She presses the button.)

1299
00:50:34,236 --> 00:50:35,606
(Clicking)

1300
00:50:35,606 --> 00:50:39,077
Team Haha pressed the reset button...

1301
00:50:39,207 --> 00:50:41,417
- and spun the roulette. - We are lucky.

1302
00:50:42,117 --> 00:50:43,247
We are lucky.

1303
00:50:44,486 --> 00:50:46,617
(Are the targets reset?)

1304
00:50:46,617 --> 00:50:49,216
We should go up again if the targets are upstairs.

1305
00:50:49,216 --> 00:50:51,227
(It seems like we missed them.)

1306
00:50:51,727 --> 00:50:53,287
This won't do.

1307
00:50:55,756 --> 00:50:57,526
(It's 15 minutes before the end of the race.)

1308
00:50:57,526 --> 00:50:59,796
The roulettes are spinning.

1309
00:51:00,437 --> 00:51:04,267
The new targets will be selected.

1310
00:51:04,267 --> 00:51:06,636
(The new targets are being selected thanks to Haha and Z Young.)

1311
00:51:06,937 --> 00:51:08,437
Who are the new targets?

1312
00:51:08,437 --> 00:51:10,377
(Who will be the chosen ones?)

1313
00:51:10,377 --> 00:51:11,477
Who are they?

1314
00:51:11,477 --> 00:51:13,977
(Who will be the chosen ones?)

1315
00:51:18,747 --> 00:51:21,386
(New female target)

1316
00:51:21,386 --> 00:51:23,117
The new female target...

1317
00:51:23,256 --> 00:51:25,026
is Kei.

1318
00:51:25,026 --> 00:51:28,696
(The new female target is Kei.)

1319
00:51:28,696 --> 00:51:30,466
(What should we do, Jong Kook?)

1320
00:51:30,466 --> 00:51:32,466
- My goodness. - I see people over there.

1321
00:51:32,466 --> 00:51:33,667
- Where? - Am I wrong?

1322
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:35,537
Come here. People won't come this way.

1323
00:51:35,537 --> 00:51:37,406
It will be hard to remove Kei's name tag...

1324
00:51:37,406 --> 00:51:40,307
- because of Jong Kook. - She has Jong Kook by her side.

1325
00:51:40,307 --> 00:51:41,707
It will be impossible to remove it.

1326
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:44,647
Seung Un, it will be hard to win today.

1327
00:51:44,647 --> 00:51:46,207
Let's give up.

1328
00:51:48,716 --> 00:51:50,446
The new male target...

1329
00:51:50,617 --> 00:51:51,747
is...

1330
00:51:53,247 --> 00:51:54,756
Yu Jae Seok.

1331
00:51:54,756 --> 00:51:57,057
(The new male target is Yu Jae Seok.)

1332
00:51:57,057 --> 00:51:58,256
(This is insane.)

1333
00:51:58,256 --> 00:52:00,227
For goodness' sake.

1334
00:52:00,227 --> 00:52:01,497
This is insane.

1335
00:52:01,497 --> 00:52:04,066
I need to go to the ninth floor.

1336
00:52:05,127 --> 00:52:08,497
(Why does he want to go to the 9th floor?)

1337
00:52:08,497 --> 00:52:11,636
(10 minutes ago, the rooftop garden on the 9th floor)

1338
00:52:12,906 --> 00:52:14,736
This is incredible.

1339
00:52:16,236 --> 00:52:20,046
(They found the reset button.)

1340
00:52:21,247 --> 00:52:23,886
If we become the targets, we need to come press this.

1341
00:52:23,917 --> 00:52:25,886
- Okay. I'll stay here. - Good.

1342
00:52:26,687 --> 00:52:28,187
(They called dibs on the button.)

1343
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:30,316
Please, please, please. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1344
00:52:30,457 --> 00:52:31,827
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1345
00:52:34,356 --> 00:52:35,696
This is a good place.

1346
00:52:35,696 --> 00:52:37,327
- Shall I hide? - Sit here.

1347
00:52:37,327 --> 00:52:39,167
- Shall I hide? - Sit here.

1348
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:41,497
- Can I turn on the light? - Wait here.

1349
00:52:41,497 --> 00:52:42,767
- Okay? - By myself?

1350
00:52:42,867 --> 00:52:44,167
- Remain hidden. - Okay.

1351
00:52:44,167 --> 00:52:47,577
I will go and find the reset button. Wait here, okay?

1352
00:52:47,676 --> 00:52:48,906
Can I close the door?

1353
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:50,707
I will close the door.

1354
00:52:50,707 --> 00:52:51,977
(She gets separated from her big brother.)

1355
00:52:51,977 --> 00:52:54,377
I am scared. I hope no one comes here.

1356
00:52:55,417 --> 00:52:59,417
It looks like there would be a reset button here.

1357
00:53:00,316 --> 00:53:03,756
(While Jong Kook is looking for a reset button,)

1358
00:53:03,756 --> 00:53:06,827
(Jae Seok enters the 9th floor.)

1359
00:53:08,656 --> 00:53:13,897
(Is Jong Kook coming?)

1360
00:53:13,897 --> 00:53:15,497
(Peeking)

1361
00:53:15,796 --> 00:53:17,106
I don't see them.

1362
00:53:20,136 --> 00:53:23,077
(She gets caught.)

1363
00:53:23,077 --> 00:53:25,077
What should I do?

1364
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:26,807
What should I do? I should lock the door.

1365
00:53:31,287 --> 00:53:33,716
(Peeking)

1366
00:53:33,716 --> 00:53:37,386
(Kei, are you there?)

1367
00:53:37,386 --> 00:53:39,127
(Holding her breath)

1368
00:53:39,127 --> 00:53:40,227
No one is here.

1369
00:53:41,097 --> 00:53:43,057
(Look inside.)

1370
00:53:48,236 --> 00:53:50,506
(She is found.)

1371
00:53:50,506 --> 00:53:51,937
(Kei fails to remain hidden.)

1372
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,336
Good job. Good job.

1373
00:53:55,236 --> 00:53:56,676
Save me.

1374
00:53:56,676 --> 00:53:58,707
(Save me, Jong Kook.)

1375
00:53:58,707 --> 00:54:00,046
Where could it be?

1376
00:54:00,046 --> 00:54:02,276
(Jong Kook is looking for a reset button.)

1377
00:54:02,276 --> 00:54:06,847
(Jae Seok is the only one who can save Kei.)

1378
00:54:08,256 --> 00:54:09,656
Kei, Kei.

1379
00:54:10,727 --> 00:54:11,957
This is great.

1380
00:54:12,086 --> 00:54:13,656
All right.

1381
00:54:14,597 --> 00:54:16,997
I am sorry. I am sorry.

1382
00:54:16,997 --> 00:54:19,026
This is great.

1383
00:54:19,727 --> 00:54:21,037
- I am sorry. - Sung Hoon.

1384
00:54:21,037 --> 00:54:22,497
You are cool.

1385
00:54:22,667 --> 00:54:24,836
- Kei, thank you. - How did you find her?

1386
00:54:27,336 --> 00:54:30,747
(Help me, reset button.)

1387
00:54:30,747 --> 00:54:32,877
Jae Seok pressed...

1388
00:54:32,877 --> 00:54:34,546
the reset button...

1389
00:54:34,546 --> 00:54:36,676
and spun the roulettes.

1390
00:54:37,386 --> 00:54:39,216
Where was the reset button?

1391
00:54:40,017 --> 00:54:41,356
The new targets could be among us.

1392
00:54:41,517 --> 00:54:42,957
Grab them.

1393
00:54:43,586 --> 00:54:45,187
(Grab the name tag.)

1394
00:54:45,187 --> 00:54:46,986
- You can't do that. - Kwang Soo.

1395
00:54:47,196 --> 00:54:48,397
Grab her name tag.

1396
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,127
Grab her name tag.

1397
00:54:50,127 --> 00:54:51,196
Stand up.

1398
00:54:51,196 --> 00:54:53,327
(Seung Un, don't lie down on the floor.)

1399
00:54:53,327 --> 00:54:55,937
Watch where you touch.

1400
00:54:55,937 --> 00:54:57,767
- What? - Wait a second.

1401
00:54:57,767 --> 00:54:59,267
- Wait a minute. - You went too far.

1402
00:54:59,267 --> 00:55:01,537
- All right. - You went too far.

1403
00:55:01,807 --> 00:55:03,636
- Seung Un, are you okay? - Excuse me.

1404
00:55:03,636 --> 00:55:05,276
- Seung Un. - My goodness.

1405
00:55:05,276 --> 00:55:06,347
(I am serious. I only grabbed her name tag.)

1406
00:55:06,347 --> 00:55:08,147
You went too far.

1407
00:55:08,216 --> 00:55:10,216
- What do you think you are doing? - Don't touch her during a game.

1408
00:55:10,216 --> 00:55:12,247
- I was joking. - What do you think you are doing?

1409
00:55:12,816 --> 00:55:15,486
Seung Un, watch where you touch.

1410
00:55:16,316 --> 00:55:17,957
It will be funny if one of us becomes the new target.

1411
00:55:17,957 --> 00:55:19,856
If one of us is the new target, let's give up the name tag.

1412
00:55:19,856 --> 00:55:21,897
Shall we rip each other's name tag?

1413
00:55:21,897 --> 00:55:25,026
The roulettes are spinning to select the new targets.

1414
00:55:25,026 --> 00:55:26,696
(It's time to select the targets.)

1415
00:55:26,696 --> 00:55:28,367
(Who are...)

1416
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:30,136
(the new targets?)

1417
00:55:30,136 --> 00:55:31,566
(The new female target is Hwang Seung Un.)

1418
00:55:31,566 --> 00:55:34,477
The new female target is Hwang Seung Un.

1419
00:55:34,606 --> 00:55:36,377
Let's go to a different floor. Let's go down.

1420
00:55:36,377 --> 00:55:38,707
Let's go down. I shouldn't be here.

1421
00:55:38,707 --> 00:55:40,046
(Seung Un plans to hide.)

1422
00:55:40,046 --> 00:55:41,946
(It's okay to leave her by herself, right?)

1423
00:55:44,086 --> 00:55:45,816
- There she is. - Where?

1424
00:55:45,917 --> 00:55:47,386
There is Seung Un.

1425
00:55:48,957 --> 00:55:50,727
(Is Seung Un spotted...)

1426
00:55:50,727 --> 00:55:51,827
(already?)

1427
00:55:51,827 --> 00:55:54,897
- Seung Un. - That's So Min.

1428
00:55:56,526 --> 00:55:57,796
(He is imagining things.)

1429
00:55:57,796 --> 00:55:59,397
- That's So Min. - That's So Min.

1430
00:55:59,827 --> 00:56:01,336
What's wrong with me today?

1431
00:56:01,636 --> 00:56:03,136
How can you confuse Seung Un with So Min?

1432
00:56:03,807 --> 00:56:05,106
Hurry up.

1433
00:56:05,606 --> 00:56:07,776
- Let's take the elevator. - Is it okay to move as a crowd?

1434
00:56:07,776 --> 00:56:09,377
This elevator is too crowded.

1435
00:56:09,477 --> 00:56:10,546
Please take the other one.

1436
00:56:10,546 --> 00:56:11,606
- I am sorry. - He can take my spot.

1437
00:56:11,606 --> 00:56:13,606
Excuse me, keep your hands off of me.

1438
00:56:14,477 --> 00:56:16,816
The new male target may be announced while we are here. Be careful.

1439
00:56:19,117 --> 00:56:21,486
We shouldn't go up. Should we go down?

1440
00:56:21,486 --> 00:56:23,117
(Se Chan and Elijah take the next elevator.)

1441
00:56:23,117 --> 00:56:25,026
(At that moment)

1442
00:56:25,426 --> 00:56:28,497
The new male target is Yang Se Chan.

1443
00:56:28,497 --> 00:56:30,026
(The new male target is Yang Se Chan.)

1444
00:56:30,026 --> 00:56:34,037
(Is Se Chan the new target?)

1445
00:56:34,037 --> 00:56:36,537
(Se Chan is right before their eyes.)

1446
00:56:36,537 --> 00:56:38,836
You little...

1447
00:56:39,367 --> 00:56:41,437
They are going down.

1448
00:56:41,636 --> 00:56:43,906
- Which floor are we on? - We are on the sixth floor.

1449
00:56:44,377 --> 00:56:47,617
(The door closes.)

1450
00:56:47,617 --> 00:56:49,917
It must be us. It must be us.

1451
00:56:51,216 --> 00:56:53,247
- Oh, my goodness! - We're going down!

1452
00:56:54,216 --> 00:56:56,386
(Oh, no! What are we going to do?)

1453
00:56:57,017 --> 00:56:58,856
(Everyone, we're leaving before you!)

1454
00:56:58,856 --> 00:56:59,986
It was us!

1455
00:57:00,497 --> 00:57:01,926
The new target is Se Chan.

1456
00:57:04,127 --> 00:57:05,267
- It's Se Chan? - What?

1457
00:57:05,267 --> 00:57:07,466
- Se Chan is the target. - It's Se Chan!

1458
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:08,767
(Everyone is panicking.)

1459
00:57:08,767 --> 00:57:09,867
- Hurry. - What floor?

1460
00:57:09,867 --> 00:57:11,336
He's on the sixth floor.

1461
00:57:11,667 --> 00:57:13,236
- Hey, hurry. - Come on. Get in quickly.

1462
00:57:13,236 --> 00:57:14,736
- Hurry. - Move faster.

1463
00:57:14,736 --> 00:57:16,037
- Just get in. - Get in.

1464
00:57:16,037 --> 00:57:18,147
We should've let him take the elevator.

1465
00:57:18,147 --> 00:57:19,446
He was here a few seconds ago.

1466
00:57:19,446 --> 00:57:21,147
We should've let him.

1467
00:57:22,117 --> 00:57:25,216
(Se Chan and Elijah search for the reset button, beating the crisis.)

1468
00:57:25,216 --> 00:57:26,216
Why is it already me?

1469
00:57:26,216 --> 00:57:27,586
(Se Chan and Elijah search for the reset button, beating the crisis.)

1470
00:57:27,586 --> 00:57:29,517
Se Chan, let me go before you.

1471
00:57:29,886 --> 00:57:31,057
(Elijah acts as his bodyguard.)

1472
00:57:31,057 --> 00:57:33,057
- Hey, this... - We might get locked up here.

1473
00:57:33,426 --> 00:57:34,856
Hey, you haven't seen Se Chan?

1474
00:57:34,856 --> 00:57:37,127
- No, I haven't. - He went downstairs where you were.

1475
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:39,397
Haha, I'm right here.

1476
00:57:39,696 --> 00:57:40,696
Z Young.

1477
00:57:40,696 --> 00:57:42,667
(A long journey in search of Se Chan)

1478
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:43,667
What is it?

1479
00:57:43,667 --> 00:57:44,667
(Hey!)

1480
00:57:44,807 --> 00:57:47,707
(Did she find Se Chan?)

1481
00:57:47,977 --> 00:57:49,977
- You're not the target? - No, he's not.

1482
00:57:49,977 --> 00:57:51,676
You're not the target?

1483
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:53,546
(So Min cheerfully attacks Haha.)

1484
00:57:53,546 --> 00:57:55,676
- It's Se Chan. - Right. This is so confusing.

1485
00:57:55,676 --> 00:57:56,676
Goodness.

1486
00:57:56,676 --> 00:57:58,747
(She always has new ways of making us laugh.)

1487
00:57:59,347 --> 00:58:00,957
- Hey, what about this? - Okay.

1488
00:58:00,957 --> 00:58:02,156
Don't open the door yet.

1489
00:58:02,957 --> 00:58:04,287
Go to the end of the hall.

1490
00:58:04,457 --> 00:58:06,787
Elijah, go to the end of the hall.

1491
00:58:06,787 --> 00:58:08,256
- No one is here. - Go to the end of the hall first.

1492
00:58:08,497 --> 00:58:09,526
Go first.

1493
00:58:10,426 --> 00:58:13,367
If someone's there, pretend you're looking for me.

1494
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:14,367
Hurry.

1495
00:58:16,767 --> 00:58:19,006
(Women versus Wild, Guard Se Chan)

1496
00:58:19,966 --> 00:58:21,236
(So Min searches for Se Chan with Sung Hoon.)

1497
00:58:21,236 --> 00:58:23,606
I saw someone. Come on. Hurry.

1498
00:58:23,606 --> 00:58:24,707
(She spots someone.)

1499
00:58:25,747 --> 00:58:27,847
(She's getting nervous. Someone is coming here?)

1500
00:58:29,046 --> 00:58:30,147
(Save me.)

1501
00:58:30,147 --> 00:58:32,147
- They're coming? - Yes.

1502
00:58:32,147 --> 00:58:34,517
(Let's change our strategy. Come. Let's hide!)

1503
00:58:34,517 --> 00:58:35,517
Where are they?

1504
00:58:36,517 --> 00:58:37,526
I saw someone there.

1505
00:58:37,526 --> 00:58:39,656
(So Min and Sung Hoon are getting close.)

1506
00:58:41,256 --> 00:58:43,497
(They reach the hallway where Elijah was.)

1507
00:58:43,997 --> 00:58:45,867
(I definitely saw someone...)

1508
00:58:45,867 --> 00:58:47,367
(somewhere around here.)

1509
00:58:47,367 --> 00:58:48,367
Sung Hoon.

1510
00:58:49,796 --> 00:58:50,836
Sung Hoon.

1511
00:58:51,066 --> 00:58:52,167
Someone's here.

1512
00:58:52,167 --> 00:58:53,736
(This voice...)

1513
00:58:53,736 --> 00:58:55,636
(is So Min's.)

1514
00:58:55,636 --> 00:58:57,477
(It's going to be me who catches Se Chan.)

1515
00:58:58,747 --> 00:59:00,847
(Only a door is standing...)

1516
00:59:00,847 --> 00:59:03,477
(between the destinies of these two.)

1517
00:59:04,986 --> 00:59:06,517
(Now...)

1518
00:59:06,847 --> 00:59:08,017
Let's find the button.

1519
00:59:09,117 --> 00:59:10,557
(Se Chan,)

1520
00:59:10,557 --> 00:59:11,756
(are you hiding here?)

1521
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:14,951
(Se Chan is rushing to find the reset button.)

1522
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,781
(Did he find something?)

1523
00:59:20,781 --> 00:59:22,320
(He finds the reset button...)

1524
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,951
(at last!)

1525
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:27,320
(Se Chan, are you here?)

1526
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,931
Let's not go there. He's not there. What should we do?

1527
00:59:30,931 --> 00:59:33,500
(She ran and ran, but she fails to find Se Chan.)

1528
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:36,931
(Se Chan, we did it!)

1529
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:40,400
(Oh, the days when we were chased and hunted...)

1530
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,141
(With one push to this reset button, those days are over.)

1531
00:59:42,141 --> 00:59:43,610
(Pushing)

1532
00:59:44,911 --> 00:59:47,511
(The reset has been completed after a long chase.)

1533
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:53,181
The new male target is Yu Jae Seok.

1534
00:59:53,181 --> 00:59:55,090
The new female target is Hwang Seung Un.

1535
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,451
(The roulette selects Jae Seok as the male target.)

1536
00:59:57,451 --> 00:59:59,761
(The roulette selects Seung Un as the female target.)

1537
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:01,831
Kwang Soo, I'll be on the 10th floor.

1538
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:03,391
- Hide on the 10th floor. - Okay.

1539
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,331
No, no. Are you going to come with me?

1540
01:00:08,701 --> 01:00:10,130
She went down a while ago. She went down.

1541
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:11,971
- To where? - To the first floor.

1542
01:00:11,971 --> 01:00:13,440
Where? Where is she?

1543
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,911
(She locates the target with her good vision.)

1544
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:15,911
She's either on 1st or 2nd floor.

1545
01:00:15,911 --> 01:00:17,141
A floor below us? Which one is it?

1546
01:00:17,141 --> 01:00:18,741
I think she's a floor below us.

1547
01:00:18,911 --> 01:00:20,040
She went down.

1548
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,681
(Through the window, Seung Un's back is spotted.)

1549
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:24,951
(I'm going to catch you. It's their chance to turn the table around.)

1550
01:00:26,681 --> 01:00:28,721
- Everyone knows we're here. - Goodness, I...

1551
01:00:29,851 --> 01:00:32,061
- was going to stay here. - They're coming. Hurry. Get in!

1552
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:33,920
Close the elevator! They're coming. Hurry. Get in!

1553
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,290
(Where are you running off to, guys?)

1554
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:39,860
(She lowers her body right away.)

1555
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:43,170
(She presses the button to close the door desperately.)

1556
01:00:43,331 --> 01:00:45,741
(Kwang Soo, please stop them.)

1557
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:49,170
(Kwang Soo is blocking the way the best he can.)

1558
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:50,940
(You want to outdo me in strength?)

1559
01:00:52,241 --> 01:00:53,840
(The doors are closing. Did she succeed?)

1560
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:57,851
(You thought you could get away from me?)

1561
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,320
Close the elevator.

1562
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,991
(After dashing at full speed like a tiger,)

1563
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:03,621
(he sticks his foot in to prevent the doors from closing.)

1564
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,420
Close it!

1565
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:07,590
(Where are you going?)

1566
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:09,331
- I got her! - Seung Un!

1567
01:01:09,331 --> 01:01:12,031
- I'm sorry. - No, don't.

1568
01:01:12,031 --> 01:01:14,130
I'm so sorry.

1569
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:15,730
(The race was almost over.)

1570
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:17,431
- Are you okay? - I'm okay.

1571
01:01:17,801 --> 01:01:19,340
Kei, I got the name tag.

1572
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:21,241
- Goodness. - I'm glad at least we got one.

1573
01:01:21,241 --> 01:01:23,641
I stopped the elevator with my foot.

1574
01:01:23,641 --> 01:01:24,840
We scored one at the end of the race.

1575
01:01:26,081 --> 01:01:27,880
Please decide if you're going to switch your ball or not.

1576
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:31,051
(All they have left to do is to decide whether to change or not.)

1577
01:01:32,281 --> 01:01:35,150
(Kwang Soo and Seung Un tried desperately to keep the ball.)

1578
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,551
(It's the chance to double their mission money.)

1579
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,031
(Kwang Soo wanted Seung Un to keep it as he was worried.)

1580
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,630
(Just like Kwang Soo's request,)

1581
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:45,761
(does she have the ball with the multiplication card?)

1582
01:01:45,761 --> 01:01:47,130
(The time has come.)

1583
01:01:47,431 --> 01:01:49,301
Hold on. Let me see my balls. I can switch them.

1584
01:01:49,301 --> 01:01:51,040
(Shall I switch my ball?)

1585
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:53,900
(Kwang Soo must keep the ball to win the race.)

1586
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:55,641
- I can switch them. - Switch the ball with ours.

1587
01:01:55,641 --> 01:01:57,681
(Is this a smoke screen tactic?)

1588
01:01:57,741 --> 01:02:00,511
(As she's willing to switch, it's getting more suspicious.)

1589
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:04,951
(Seung Un is asking him to switch the ball in a nonchalant manner.)

1590
01:02:04,951 --> 01:02:08,520
(What is at the end of the road for these two teams?)

1591
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:11,391
The race is over.

1592
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:13,290
Everyone, please assemble in the lobby.

1593
01:02:13,391 --> 01:02:16,531
This is Half and Half Project Part 2.

1594
01:02:16,531 --> 01:02:19,730
I'll announce the winners of Public Enemy Race.

1595
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,400
It's either Jong Kook or Haha.

1596
01:02:21,701 --> 01:02:24,130
(Jong Kook and Kei have 50 dollars after removing Seung Un's name tag.)

1597
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:26,070
Haha and Z Young...

1598
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:28,241
(What is the current score of Haha and Z Young?)

1599
01:02:28,241 --> 01:02:29,411
- I guess he won. - Did we...

1600
01:02:29,411 --> 01:02:30,811
You've won the 1st place with 93 dollars.

1601
01:02:30,811 --> 01:02:31,980
(Currently, they are ranked 1st.)

1602
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:34,451
(What?)

1603
01:02:34,451 --> 01:02:35,511
Haha won again?

1604
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:37,511
Haha won three weeks in a row.

1605
01:02:37,511 --> 01:02:39,820
I haven't applied the multiplication card yet.

1606
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:41,451
(Current standing of the mission money)

1607
01:02:41,451 --> 01:02:42,721
- Are you serious? - You haven't?

1608
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,761
- This is amazing. - We did so well.

1609
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,190
- If Haha wins... - We won because we are good.

1610
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:50,730
If Haha wins again, that means he won three weeks in a row.

1611
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:54,601
But if another team has the doubling card, they can change the outcome.

1612
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,500
(The game...)

1613
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,701
(isn't over yet.)

1614
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:01,440
They can change the outcome.

1615
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,340
(The winners of the race will be determined...)

1616
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:06,411
(depending on who has the multiplication card.)

1617
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:09,511
Currently, Haha and Z Young, who are in the lead,

1618
01:03:09,551 --> 01:03:12,150
have one last chance to change their ball.

1619
01:03:12,351 --> 01:03:15,520
You can change either one or both balls of your pick.

1620
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:19,061
(They can change their balls with a couple of their choice.)

1621
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:20,121
(This is the perfect chance for us.)

1622
01:03:20,221 --> 01:03:21,960
- Seriously? - This is unbelievable.

1623
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,730
This is incredible.

1624
01:03:24,061 --> 01:03:26,061
- Z Young, this is no joke. - He's definitely going to win now.

1625
01:03:26,061 --> 01:03:27,931
This is driving me crazy.

1626
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:29,630
If you have the multiplication card, you'll win.

1627
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:32,701
But if we get the division card, that'll ruin us though.

1628
01:03:32,701 --> 01:03:34,371
This is driving me crazy.

1629
01:03:34,641 --> 01:03:36,070
If you get to double your money, you'll win for sure.

1630
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:38,540
You don't have to change your balls.

1631
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:40,141
But I don't want to do that.

1632
01:03:40,141 --> 01:03:41,851
(To win, he must acquire the multiplication card.)

1633
01:03:43,081 --> 01:03:48,820
(Which couple is holding the multiplication card?)

1634
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:53,360
(He's caught at a crossroad.)

1635
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,630
(An incident flashes by in his head.)

1636
01:03:55,561 --> 01:04:02,070
(From the start, Kwang Soo had drawn and kept it.)

1637
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:03,331
(I won't be safe.)

1638
01:04:03,331 --> 01:04:05,840
(You should hold onto it. They'll remove my name tag.)

1639
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,511
(He gave it to her as he predicted that his name tag would be removed.)

1640
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:12,811
What should I do?

1641
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:17,451
(They were careful in order to keep the card.)

1642
01:04:17,451 --> 01:04:21,150
(Let's win. Protecting this card is the only thing left for us.)

1643
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:22,420
Let's go downstairs for now.

1644
01:04:23,051 --> 01:04:24,820
(And a man has been...)

1645
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:28,130
(eavesdropping their conversation the whole time.)

1646
01:04:30,661 --> 01:04:32,301
(I already know...)

1647
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:34,900
(what your plan is.)

1648
01:04:36,101 --> 01:04:38,900
(Is he going to switch the ball with Seung Un who had it all along?)

1649
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,540
All right.

1650
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:41,911
(I have made my decision.)

1651
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:44,141
(With whom will he switch the ball?)

1652
01:04:44,141 --> 01:04:45,141
I'll choose Jong Kook's.

1653
01:04:45,141 --> 01:04:47,311
(I'll choose Jong Kook's.)

1654
01:04:47,311 --> 01:04:49,051
(Did he just choose Jong Kook's?)

1655
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:52,920
(What a twist. He didn't choose Seung Un's.)

1656
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,420
(He chose Jong Kook's ball?)

1657
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:57,820
Is it possible he didn't check?

1658
01:04:58,121 --> 01:04:59,920
(Haha makes an unexpected trade. He switches it with Jong Kook's.)

1659
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,090
I guess he really didn't check.

1660
01:05:01,161 --> 01:05:04,931
Then the information that leaked during the race...

1661
01:05:04,931 --> 01:05:07,601
might have been false.

1662
01:05:07,601 --> 01:05:09,201
- That's possible. - It's not over...

1663
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:10,831
- until it's over. - Really?

1664
01:05:10,831 --> 01:05:13,701
They were saying how they had “multiply by 2" and got it stolen.

1665
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,471
- Don't let your guard down. - Can I check?

1666
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:18,911
Then Z Young, please reveal what your ball is.

1667
01:05:18,911 --> 01:05:19,980
(Z Young reveals her ball.)

1668
01:05:20,281 --> 01:05:22,951
It's a full-course tour in Rome, Italy.

1669
01:05:22,951 --> 01:05:24,581
(She has Rome, Italy.)

1670
01:05:24,581 --> 01:05:25,980
I want to go there.

1671
01:05:26,351 --> 01:05:28,020
This is amazing.

1672
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:30,290
- You should win. - You should.

1673
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:32,460
(If Team Haha wins, they get to go to the beautiful Rome.)

1674
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:35,690
Next, we'll reveal Haha's ball.

1675
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:38,400
(Haha chose an unexpected one. Does he have “multiply by 2"?)

1676
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:42,101
(If Haha doesn't have "times by 2" and Team Kwang Soo does,)

1677
01:05:42,101 --> 01:05:45,770
(everyone except Kwang Soo has to go on the Insano Water Slide.)

1678
01:05:47,301 --> 01:05:51,610
(“Multiply by 2" ball will be the deciding factor.)

1679
01:05:52,241 --> 01:05:55,150
(What is the future that awaits the Running Man members?)

1680
01:05:56,051 --> 01:05:57,250
It was true.

1681
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:00,351
(This is what he was hoping for.)

1682
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,451
It was true.

1683
01:06:02,451 --> 01:06:03,820
(Haha found “multiply by 2".)

1684
01:06:04,761 --> 01:06:05,790
It was true.

1685
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:08,360
(He actually found it.)

1686
01:06:09,561 --> 01:06:12,000
(That means Jong Kook had Seung Un's ball.)

1687
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,831
(How did Haha find out?)

1688
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:16,770
(5 minutes before the end of race)

1689
01:06:17,801 --> 01:06:21,110
(He was watching something before the mission was over.)

1690
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:25,011
(Jong Kook was ripping Seung Un's name tag in the elevator.)

1691
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:30,011
(He was watching everything live.)

1692
01:06:30,851 --> 01:06:34,620
(Jong Kook had to switch his ball with Seung Un now.)

1693
01:06:36,551 --> 01:06:39,590
(Shall we switch?)

1694
01:06:41,090 --> 01:06:43,330
(No, don't take hers.)

1695
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:48,571
(Kwang Soo could only win if he kept the “multiply by 2" ball.)

1696
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:51,141
Let's switch our balls.

1697
01:06:51,801 --> 01:06:52,941
All of a sudden?

1698
01:06:53,240 --> 01:07:00,080
(She had to switch with Jong Kook's ball.)

1699
01:07:00,681 --> 01:07:01,750
(Jong Kook's Fly Toledo in Spain...)

1700
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:02,981
(got switched with her “multiply by 2" ball.)

1701
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,181
Isn't she back yet? Kwang Soo, come here for a second.

1702
01:07:05,981 --> 01:07:09,651
(Is this over for us now?)

1703
01:07:10,851 --> 01:07:15,261
(Haha saw everything and put the puzzle together.)

1704
01:07:15,261 --> 01:07:20,030
So Haha and Z Young win with 186 dollars.

1705
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:22,401
(They win with 186 dollars.)

1706
01:07:22,401 --> 01:07:24,370
(It was a dramatic win thanks to Haha's move.)

1707
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:25,641
Haha's been winning for three weeks.

1708
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:27,500
- He's been winning for three weeks. - The married ones win.

1709
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,141
- That doesn't make sense. - That's awesome.

1710
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:33,780
- The destination is Rome, Italy. - It's a full tour.

1711
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:35,380
It's worth going.

1712
01:07:35,481 --> 01:07:38,181
You can buy a name tag for 30 dollars.

1713
01:07:38,181 --> 01:07:39,851
3 times by 6 is 18. They can buy 6.

1714
01:07:39,851 --> 01:07:42,120
- You can buy 6 in total. - They can buy 6.

1715
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:43,721
Before that...

1716
01:07:43,721 --> 01:07:45,120
(What is it now?)

1717
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,420
Since we have guests here today, I said they'll get a huge reward.

1718
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:49,261
- That's right. - I said it's a good one.

1719
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:51,901
- Please bring it in. - It's amazing.

1720
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:53,460
(These are all great items.)

1721
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:54,971
They can buy them.

1722
01:07:55,231 --> 01:07:58,240
Z Young gets to choose.

1723
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:01,271
You have 186 dollars,

1724
01:08:01,271 --> 01:08:03,941
so you can purchase name tags with the remaining amount.

1725
01:08:04,941 --> 01:08:06,080
Can I get two boxes of Korean beef?

1726
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,950
Then you can't buy any name tags.

1727
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:09,410
What are the name tags for?

1728
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:11,821
(She doesn't understand.)

1729
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:14,051
Sorry, but can you please wash your face and focus?

1730
01:08:14,651 --> 01:08:16,450
Why do we need to buy name tags?

1731
01:08:16,721 --> 01:08:18,861
- Just get these two. - Right.

1732
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:20,761
She'll get pregnant with her second child soon.

1733
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:23,830
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1734
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:26,101
- You're getting no name tags? - Congratulations.

1735
01:08:26,901 --> 01:08:28,370
Congratulations, Z Young.

1736
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,401
(Honey, I'm bringing home meat.)

1737
01:08:30,330 --> 01:08:32,601
Z Young made her comeback, so please spin the roulette.

1738
01:08:32,601 --> 01:08:33,840
- Spin it. - Z Young.

1739
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:37,340
- Thank you. - You can do it.

1740
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,181
In 1, 2, 3.

1741
01:08:40,181 --> 01:08:41,380
(Today's destination...)

1742
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:43,981
- Seok Jin wanted to go there. - That's right.

1743
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:47,021
(It's a city everybody wants to visit.)

1744
01:08:47,021 --> 01:08:48,151
I wanted to go there.

1745
01:08:48,151 --> 01:08:50,891
(It's the city of everybody's dreams.)

1746
01:08:50,891 --> 01:08:55,490
(It's an opportunity to experience the cultural heritage.)

1747
01:08:55,490 --> 01:09:00,030
(Who will get to go to Rome, the historical and romantic city?)

1748
01:09:01,401 --> 01:09:02,471
It's stopping.

1749
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:05,370
(Please come to me, Rome.)

1750
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:07,271
- Yang Se... - Jee Seok Jin.

1751
01:09:07,271 --> 01:09:12,280
(At this rate, it's either Seok Jin or Jae Seok.)

1752
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,181
(It passes Seok Jin.)

1753
01:09:14,181 --> 01:09:16,181
Yu Jae... Who is it?

1754
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:18,321
(It goes back.)

1755
01:09:19,151 --> 01:09:20,250
Me?

1756
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:21,391
(Will he get picked again?)

1757
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:22,851
It's Jae Seok.

1758
01:09:22,851 --> 01:09:24,151
(Jae Seok gets picked again.)

1759
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:27,321
It's Jae Seok.

1760
01:09:27,321 --> 01:09:28,790
(He gets picked every time the roulette gets spun.)

1761
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:30,590
He's so lucky.

1762
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:32,601
Take them all.

1763
01:09:32,931 --> 01:09:35,870
You can take everything, you greedy person.

1764
01:09:36,401 --> 01:09:37,941
- It looks good. - Se Chan.

1765
01:09:38,271 --> 01:09:40,401
Is this Jae Seok's "Let's Go on a Trip"?

1766
01:09:40,401 --> 01:09:43,740
- Is this a new show? - Jae Seok is all over the world.

1767
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:44,941
(He's already on two of them.)

1768
01:09:44,941 --> 01:09:47,380
(In a moment)

1769
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:51,880
(The roulette war is not over yet.)

1770
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,450
(It's the final race of Half and Half Project.)

1771
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:57,521
(There are suspicious rooms and doors to decide the final location.)

1772
01:09:58,691 --> 01:10:01,590
(What are these rooms for?)

1773
01:10:02,691 --> 01:10:04,801
It's a nice, cool day.

1774
01:10:04,801 --> 01:10:05,861
(A few days after the Couple Race)

1775
01:10:06,261 --> 01:10:08,500
Why am I here by myself?

1776
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,401
What's this?

1777
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,941
- Is this today's mission? - Here we go again.

1778
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:14,710
These punks.

1779
01:10:15,111 --> 01:10:18,011
"There are doors numbered 1 to 4 at the place you'll be gathering."

1780
01:10:18,011 --> 01:10:20,210
"Each door contains a different amount of mission money."

1781
01:10:20,311 --> 01:10:22,580
"Number 1 is 30 dollars, number 2 is 50 dollars..."

1782
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:24,721
"Number 3 is 70 dollars, and number 4 is 100 dollars."

1783
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:28,851
"Please choose one exit, and meet by 12pm."

1784
01:10:28,851 --> 01:10:31,261
"You'll divide the mission money depending on the number of people."

1785
01:10:31,261 --> 01:10:33,290
(The mission money gets divided up by the number of people there.)

1786
01:10:33,290 --> 01:10:34,660
It gets divided up.

1787
01:10:37,061 --> 01:10:39,830
Please tell us the exit number five minutes before you arrive.

1788
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:43,130
Again, the key point of today's race is the mission money.

1789
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:44,370
Is this the last one?

1790
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,601
Is this the last race of Half and Half Project?

1791
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:49,210
If I don't get chosen today, it's all over.

1792
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:51,981
This is the race of death.

1793
01:10:52,981 --> 01:10:54,780
Oh, gosh.

1794
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:58,151
Everybody is going for 100 dollars.

1795
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:03,321
(What would the members choose?)

1796
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:05,821
I'm going for 100 dollars. There's no point in discussing.

1797
01:11:06,221 --> 01:11:09,990
I won't go for 30 dollars or something.

1798
01:11:10,861 --> 01:11:12,901
If you are last place again...

1799
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:15,731
(Please be careful, Jae Seok.)

1800
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:18,840
- Sorry? - You already have enough.

1801
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:22,170
Oh, gosh. Why would you say that?

1802
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:23,611
- Why? - You've been really unlucky.

1803
01:11:23,611 --> 01:11:27,141
I'm so unlucky these days. I'm so unlucky.

1804
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:30,051
There are only four options.

1805
01:11:30,051 --> 01:11:31,280
(Let's be cautious today.)

1806
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:33,250
Exit 4 won't work.

1807
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:34,790
(It's the exit with 100 dollars.)

1808
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,051
It's going to be messy.

1809
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:40,861
Oh, dear. This is a dilemma.

1810
01:11:41,691 --> 01:11:43,261
You only live once.

1811
01:11:45,231 --> 01:11:46,601
Should I go for it?

1812
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:50,370
- Where are you going? - I'm going towards Exit 2.

1813
01:11:51,101 --> 01:11:52,301
Why would you do that?

1814
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:54,571
There were five people last time.

1815
01:11:56,311 --> 01:12:02,551
(In June, 5 people gathered at the exit with 100 dollars.)

1816
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:07,990
(So Min only got 20 dollars last time.)

1817
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,790
I want to be a new person now.

1818
01:12:12,321 --> 01:12:14,590
I'm going to give up on Exit 4.

1819
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:17,160
You never keep your word.

1820
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:20,101
(He doesn't trust her.)

1821
01:12:20,361 --> 01:12:23,571
How can I trust her? I just can't.

1822
01:12:23,571 --> 01:12:25,101
I'm going to Exit 3 regardless.

1823
01:12:25,101 --> 01:12:27,710
(Is Ji Hyo going to Exit 3?)

1824
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:30,071
Don't do that. I'm giving you an advice.

1825
01:12:30,071 --> 01:12:31,780
I would say Exit 4 is empty.

1826
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:33,040
No, I'm going to Exit 3.

1827
01:12:33,511 --> 01:12:35,750
Let's both go to Exit 4 and take 50 dollars each.

1828
01:12:37,111 --> 01:12:38,821
- 50 dollars each. - No, I'm going to Exit 3.

1829
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:41,051
Oh, my. Exit 3, it is.

1830
01:12:41,051 --> 01:12:42,590
(He copies Ji Hyo.)

1831
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:43,790
Should I go to Exit 4?

1832
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:45,620
I'm so confused.

1833
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:48,691
(She's having so much fun.)

1834
01:12:48,691 --> 01:12:50,191
I'm going to collapse.

1835
01:12:50,691 --> 01:12:52,460
He wanted to go to Exit 3.

1836
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:53,561
(Was she playing a psychological game?)

1837
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:56,901
Kwang Soo's going for Exit 1.

1838
01:12:57,071 --> 01:12:58,401
Yes, Kwang Soo. Where are you?

1839
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:00,370
I guess you're going for Exit 4.

1840
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:02,210
(You little moth.)

1841
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:05,111
No, petty thief. I guess you're going for Exit 1.

1842
01:13:05,111 --> 01:13:07,011
Who's a petty thief?

1843
01:13:07,981 --> 01:13:12,250
I don't think there will be any money for you.

1844
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:16,490
(There's no money for you, petty thief.)

1845
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:18,391
How much will I get?

1846
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:22,290
- You'll get around two dollars. - Oh, gosh.

1847
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:24,330
I'm going to change my tactics.

1848
01:13:25,101 --> 01:13:27,830
I'll go for Exit 4. I'll go for 100 dollars.

1849
01:13:28,431 --> 01:13:31,670
People have a very wrong idea of me.

1850
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,910
I'll show them. I'm serious.

1851
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:38,681
I have to be different today.

1852
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:39,811
(He's also trying to transform.)

1853
01:13:40,141 --> 01:13:43,181
I won three times in Half and Half Project.

1854
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:45,481
This is incredible.

1855
01:13:45,851 --> 01:13:49,250
This is a record. This is me so far.

1856
01:13:50,221 --> 01:13:52,761
I want to pretend like I'm a genius today.

1857
01:13:53,261 --> 01:13:56,160
My gut and impression...

1858
01:13:57,191 --> 01:14:02,670
are very keen, logical, and accurate.

1859
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:06,771
I want people to see that.

1860
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:11,181
The three times winner chooses...

1861
01:14:11,181 --> 01:14:15,181
(The keen winner chooses...)

1862
01:14:15,181 --> 01:14:18,080
(He's nonchalant.)

1863
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,620
Can you put hearts or chicks around my mouth?

1864
01:14:21,321 --> 01:14:25,790
(Sorry, we forgot.)

1865
01:14:27,221 --> 01:14:33,830
(Haha, the 3 times winner arrives first.)

1866
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:35,101
This is so stressful.

1867
01:14:37,571 --> 01:14:40,170
Please watch and see where my predictions take me.

1868
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:42,111
(What are we supposed to watch?)

1869
01:14:43,511 --> 01:14:48,681
(He steps into the suspicious mission ground.)

1870
01:14:50,151 --> 01:14:54,450
(Wait, what's this?)

1871
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:59,561
(Today's different. It's a strange place.)

1872
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:03,261
(The exits are on all sides of a square.)

1873
01:15:04,090 --> 01:15:08,530
(One step will change your destiny. What is this place about?)

1874
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:13,941
(Haha already made up his mind 5 minutes before arriving.)

1875
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:16,540
I'll enter.

1876
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:19,011
(Which exit did he choose after winning 3 times?)

1877
01:15:19,011 --> 01:15:20,240
Am I first?

1878
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:22,851
(Which exit did he choose after winning 3 times?)

1879
01:15:25,321 --> 01:15:28,151
(Haha chooses...)

1880
01:15:28,151 --> 01:15:33,191
(Exit 3 with 70 dollars.)

1881
01:15:33,191 --> 01:15:34,891
Let's win four times in a row.

1882
01:15:34,891 --> 01:15:36,460
(He has a good feeling.)

1883
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:42,771
(He steps into the exit.)

1884
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:45,801
(Why is there a room?)

1885
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:52,340
(This is not the end. The room is closed on all four corners.)

1886
01:15:52,941 --> 01:15:54,611
Do I need to escape or something?

1887
01:15:54,611 --> 01:15:55,750
(He's flustered.)

1888
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:57,721
(Peeking)

1889
01:16:01,351 --> 01:16:02,521
(The door opens.)

1890
01:16:02,521 --> 01:16:05,120
This is it.

1891
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,021
(Somebody must be here.)

1892
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:10,861
(The next member to arrive...)

1893
01:16:10,861 --> 01:16:14,130
(is Se Chan.)

1894
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:16,801
Let's get it.

1895
01:16:16,801 --> 01:16:17,840
(It's Se Chan.)

1896
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,071
Let's get it.

1897
01:16:21,571 --> 01:16:24,111
(If he chooses Exit 3,)

1898
01:16:24,111 --> 01:16:28,280
(they have to split the 70 dollars.)

1899
01:16:30,410 --> 01:16:34,490
(Haha chose a room with a high amount.)

1900
01:16:34,490 --> 01:16:40,361
(Se Chan is a rookie and always jumps into the fire pit.)

1901
01:16:40,361 --> 01:16:43,761
(Are they going to share a room?)

1902
01:16:43,761 --> 01:16:45,061
Is nobody here?

1903
01:16:45,861 --> 01:16:49,601
(He enters Exit 1.)

1904
01:16:49,601 --> 01:16:53,301
(Let's get 30 dollars.)

1905
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:56,040
(So Min enters next.)

1906
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,511
Hello.

1907
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:00,880
I have to look cool when I open this.

1908
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:05,750
(It's the female warrior, So Min.)

1909
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,151
Ta-da.

1910
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:11,120
(She wants to avoid the high amounts this time.)

1911
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,590
(There were too many Running Man members last time.)

1912
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:14,761
Exit 2.

1913
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:17,090
(Hold on.)

1914
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:19,731
(Hesitating)

1915
01:17:22,301 --> 01:17:23,431
Can I change?

1916
01:17:25,301 --> 01:17:27,441
(Where does she want to go?)

1917
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:31,280
(Is she going to switch?)

1918
01:17:32,181 --> 01:17:33,280
Do I go in?

1919
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,750
(She suppresses her instincts...)

1920
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:39,721
(and chooses Exit 2 with 50 dollars.)

1921
01:17:40,151 --> 01:17:41,420
There's nobody here.

1922
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:45,160
No one's here.

1923
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,721
Not everyone's here, right?

1924
01:17:46,721 --> 01:17:48,261
(Please don't come.)

1925
01:17:48,261 --> 01:17:49,660
Please don't come.

1926
01:17:51,261 --> 01:17:54,471
(Haha, So Min, and Se Chan are in separate rooms.)

1927
01:17:55,301 --> 01:18:00,870
(Jae Seok is next, and Exit 4 is still empty.)

1928
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:04,880
(He passes by Exit 3 where Haha is.)

1929
01:18:05,811 --> 01:18:08,710
(I've protected my 70 dollars.)

1930
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:12,080
(The only exits remaining...)

1931
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,420
(are Se Chan's with 30 dollars and So Min's with 50 dollars.)

1932
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:19,221
(Would he have to split with them?)

1933
01:18:19,221 --> 01:18:23,660
(Or would he choose Exit 4 and enjoy the wealth on his own?)

1934
01:18:25,361 --> 01:18:27,301
Oh, gosh.

1935
01:18:28,071 --> 01:18:30,901
(Jae Seok,)

1936
01:18:30,901 --> 01:18:33,801
(welcome.)

1937
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:37,170
(Jae Seok decides to play safe and has to share with So Min.)

1938
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:38,441
Please...

1939
01:18:39,311 --> 01:18:41,410
Why are you here?

1940
01:18:42,611 --> 01:18:44,210
Oh, gosh.

1941
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,551
So Min.

1942
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:49,151
You told me not to come here.

1943
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:52,090
Why are you here?

1944
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:53,821
You should have gone to Exit 4.

1945
01:18:53,821 --> 01:18:56,931
(I didn't know you'd be such a coward.)

1946
01:18:56,931 --> 01:18:58,330
There's Exit 3 too.

1947
01:18:59,261 --> 01:19:01,271
I felt like many people would go there, so I came here.

1948
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:04,840
Why did you do this?

1949
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:07,840
I told everybody I would go...

1950
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,870
to Exit 2 today. I'm serious.

1951
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:12,210
I should have gone for 100 dollars then.

1952
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:17,821
(Someone did go for it.)

1953
01:19:17,821 --> 01:19:21,920
(Ji Hyo enters Exit 4 by herself.)

1954
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:24,391
Please don't come.

1955
01:19:24,391 --> 01:19:27,731
(What a relief.)

1956
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:29,431
(The rooms are full now.)

1957
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:30,660
Gosh.

1958
01:19:31,561 --> 01:19:32,830
(Any exit now will be occupied.)

1959
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:34,061
Exit 4.

1960
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:38,500
(Seok Jin is next.)

1961
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:43,941
(He had a dilemma between 3 and 4. What did he choose?)

1962
01:19:46,511 --> 01:19:50,481
(He chooses number 4, and there's somebody inside.)

1963
01:19:50,681 --> 01:19:51,851
Why are you here?

1964
01:19:51,851 --> 01:19:53,851
(She's mad, but it's funny.)

1965
01:19:53,851 --> 01:19:56,351
- You said you wouldn't come here. - You said you'd go to Exit 3.

1966
01:19:58,561 --> 01:20:01,790
(He was attracted by the higher amount.)

1967
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:03,731
- This is a success. - How?

1968
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,130
You said you'd go to Exit 3.

1969
01:20:06,431 --> 01:20:08,870
You said you'd come, so I didn't go. I changed my mind.

1970
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:11,040
I changed at the end too.

1971
01:20:11,141 --> 01:20:12,740
- It's the same. - Me too.

1972
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:15,710
(They both enter the same room due to their mistrust.)

1973
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:18,780
This is pretty good.

1974
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,011
(It's good if we each get 50 dollars.)

1975
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:22,851
(Hold on.)

1976
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:28,821
(We have another roommate.)

1977
01:20:28,821 --> 01:20:30,620
(Jong Kook enters the rather peaceful 100-dollars room.)

1978
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:31,790
What is it?

1979
01:20:31,891 --> 01:20:35,231
I was certain. You weren't like this before.

1980
01:20:35,231 --> 01:20:37,391
- What's wrong with you? - This is the last one.

1981
01:20:37,391 --> 01:20:39,500
What? I was certain.

1982
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:40,731
They'll all come here.

1983
01:20:40,801 --> 01:20:43,130
- Will they all come here? - I think so.

1984
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:45,040
(At this rate, they'll each get 33 dollars.)

1985
01:20:45,370 --> 01:20:50,811
(This is the current status.)

1986
01:20:50,811 --> 01:20:53,080
I was shocked she came here.

1987
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,681
This is the last one.

1988
01:20:54,681 --> 01:20:56,181
(If Haha and Se Chan's rooms don't get any more people...)

1989
01:20:56,181 --> 01:20:57,780
I'm here by myself.

1990
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:01,151
(They get to keep the money.)

1991
01:21:03,851 --> 01:21:07,460
(Kwang Soo enters last.)

1992
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:10,960
(He was called a petty thief all morning.)

1993
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:16,170
(Kwang Soo got called all kinds of names.)

1994
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:21,971
(He was determined not to be petty and be bold.)

1995
01:21:22,311 --> 01:21:24,170
(Walking)

1996
01:21:25,181 --> 01:21:30,250
(Did he end up choosing the room with 100 dollars?)

1997
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:35,051
(Please don't come to my room.)

1998
01:21:35,651 --> 01:21:41,691
(Which roommate will he get?)

1999
01:21:41,691 --> 01:21:42,891
I'm the only one.

2000
01:21:42,891 --> 01:21:47,231
(He chooses the room with 30 dollars.)

2001
01:21:48,771 --> 01:21:52,441
(You coward)

2002
01:21:52,441 --> 01:21:53,700
What's wrong with you?

2003
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,710
- Why are you here? - What about you?

2004
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,111
Why do you keep getting in my way?

2005
01:21:59,111 --> 01:22:01,450
You are getting in mine.

2006
01:22:02,311 --> 01:22:03,950
You said you wouldn't come here.

2007
01:22:04,151 --> 01:22:06,120
I told you I'd come here.

2008
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,250
What is wrong with you?

2009
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:11,861
- Come on. - You're unbelievable.

2010
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:16,261
It's just 2, so isn't that okay? It's 2 out of 8 people.

2011
01:22:16,261 --> 01:22:18,601
This is the 30-dollar room.

2012
01:22:18,761 --> 01:22:20,101
We get 15 dollars each.

2013
01:22:21,071 --> 01:22:22,830
I got unlucky.

2014
01:22:23,231 --> 01:22:25,340
I'm the one that became unlucky.

2015
01:22:25,870 --> 01:22:28,141
I got unlucky.

2016
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:33,111
(We're both unlucky.)

2017
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,910
Everybody has entered.

2018
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:40,780
In Exit 4 with 100 dollars are Seok Jin,

2019
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:42,790
Jong Kook, and Ji Hyo.

2020
01:22:43,651 --> 01:22:45,821
You each get 33 dollars.

2021
01:22:45,821 --> 01:22:47,321
This is not bad.

2022
01:22:47,321 --> 01:22:48,561
(In Exit 4, they each get 33 dollars.)

2023
01:22:48,561 --> 01:22:49,630
I think many people went to Exit 3.

2024
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:51,761
In Exit 3,

2025
01:22:52,101 --> 01:22:53,731
there's only Haha.

2026
01:22:54,431 --> 01:22:56,231
He gets 70 dollars.

2027
01:22:56,231 --> 01:22:57,771
(In Exit 3, Haha takes 70 dollars.)

2028
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:00,040
People who chose 50 dollars...

2029
01:23:01,011 --> 01:23:04,071
are Jae Seok and So Min, so you get 25 dollars each.

2030
01:23:04,910 --> 01:23:06,710
People who chose Exit 1...

2031
01:23:06,710 --> 01:23:10,181
are Kwang Soo and Se Chan. You take 15 dollars each.

2032
01:23:10,511 --> 01:23:11,651
(Giggling)

2033
01:23:11,651 --> 01:23:14,990
- I'm so embarrassed. - Really? Kwang Soo.

2034
01:23:15,321 --> 01:23:17,490
- Se Chan. - Is she there?

2035
01:23:17,490 --> 01:23:19,361
I'm so embarrassed.

2036
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:22,261
I knew it.

2037
01:23:22,261 --> 01:23:23,290
Kwang Soo.

2038
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:24,361
(They are cowards.)

2039
01:23:24,761 --> 01:23:27,731
- I'm so envious of Haha. - Right?

2040
01:23:28,301 --> 01:23:30,030
What's going on with me?

2041
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:32,801
Half and Half Project is perfect for me.

2042
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:38,580
Here's the second mission where you can win...

2043
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:39,681
more mission money.

2044
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:40,740
(What? There are more missions?)

2045
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:42,111
It's a game called...

2046
01:23:42,111 --> 01:23:44,250
Open Sesame. Let's get started.

2047
01:23:44,521 --> 01:23:45,880
(It's the second mission.)

2048
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:48,590
(Open Sesame)

2049
01:23:48,821 --> 01:23:52,691
Underneath the table, there's a card with images and words on it.

2050
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,990
If you get the password right, the door will open.

2051
01:23:56,490 --> 01:24:00,200
In the middle of the table, there's a suitcase with 50 dollars.

2052
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:04,240
The 50 dollars goes to the person...

2053
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:08,040
who escapes the room first and takes the suitcase.

2054
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:09,571
(They must escape and take the suitcase to win 50 dollars.)

2055
01:24:09,571 --> 01:24:10,840
In the middle of the room?

2056
01:24:12,681 --> 01:24:15,580
- It's in the middle? - Let's escape.

2057
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:16,710
(Let's escape and take the suitcase.)

2058
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:18,351
Race starts now.

2059
01:24:18,351 --> 01:24:20,021
(Open Sesame starts.)

2060
01:24:20,321 --> 01:24:21,990
- What table? - Underneath the table?

2061
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:24,861
Where? Is something there?

2062
01:24:24,861 --> 01:24:26,321
- No. - A card with words?

2063
01:24:28,361 --> 01:24:30,030
(Ji Hyo finds the card.)

2064
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:32,261
- That's right. I've seen it. - This is it.

2065
01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:34,130
Haha has to solve it by himself.

2066
01:24:34,601 --> 01:24:37,130
- Let's see. - It's here.

2067
01:24:37,130 --> 01:24:38,500
(Haha overcomes the loneliness and finds the card.)

2068
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,910
"Decipher the following password, and type it on the laptop."

2069
01:24:42,571 --> 01:24:46,880
"2 syllables plus 2 syllables. The password is 4 syllables."

2070
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:49,710
Is this a word?

2071
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:53,981
What's this? Russia, rules,

2072
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:57,891
- pizza, and Kwang Soo? - It's Kwang Soo.

2073
01:24:58,891 --> 01:25:00,761
- Kwang Soo? - Giraffe.

2074
01:25:01,490 --> 01:25:03,960
What does "2 syllables" mean? The password is 4 syllables.

2075
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:05,500
(Kwang Soo is in the question.)

2076
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,231
- Are there hints in this room? - Which country's flag is this?

2077
01:25:07,571 --> 01:25:09,931
- What country is this? - Croatia?

2078
01:25:09,931 --> 01:25:11,441
No, it's France.

2079
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:16,840
(They saw Russian flags everywhere a few months ago.)

2080
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:18,111
It says...

2081
01:25:18,111 --> 01:25:19,111
(They have no idea.)

2082
01:25:19,111 --> 01:25:21,450
This is what it says.

2083
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:23,780
I know. Where's a pen? Don't you carry a pen?

2084
01:25:24,351 --> 01:25:26,651
- Why would I? - You're frustrating.

2085
01:25:27,051 --> 01:25:28,521
(He's being unfair.)

2086
01:25:28,521 --> 01:25:30,221
What could it be?

2087
01:25:30,351 --> 01:25:32,061
Look, there's a pattern.

2088
01:25:32,061 --> 01:25:33,721
What is it?

2089
01:25:33,721 --> 01:25:38,301
What's the opposite word for paradise?

2090
01:25:38,301 --> 01:25:39,830
(When rearranged,)

2091
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:43,971
(it reads "What's the opposite word for paradise?")

2092
01:25:44,130 --> 01:25:45,240
That's correct.

2093
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:47,941
- Jong Kook. - It's "underworld".

2094
01:25:47,941 --> 01:25:49,210
(The answer is underworld.)

2095
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:51,141
It's "underworld".

2096
01:25:51,141 --> 01:25:52,141
That's right.

2097
01:25:52,141 --> 01:25:53,941
Underworld is the opposite word for paradise.

2098
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:56,950
- If it's underworld... - What kind of underworld?

2099
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:59,250
What's the opposite word for paradise? Which underworld?

2100
01:25:59,851 --> 01:26:01,651
What are the syllables?

2101
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:04,561
"What's the opposite word..."

2102
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:08,861
"For."

2103
01:26:08,861 --> 01:26:09,931
Wait.

2104
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:11,460
Don't break it.

2105
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:12,700
Let me do it.

2106
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:14,401
(He tears the card.)

2107
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:15,630
What's wrong?

2108
01:26:17,231 --> 01:26:21,670
(He starts to tear the card for some reason.)

2109
01:26:21,941 --> 01:26:23,611
(Let's look for hints.)

2110
01:26:25,481 --> 01:26:27,750
(While Se Chan is occupied,)

2111
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:30,210
(Kwang Soo throws it away.)

2112
01:26:30,210 --> 01:26:32,321
Did you find something? What did you do with the rest?

2113
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:36,420
(He feels something flying by.)

2114
01:26:36,721 --> 01:26:37,721
Where's the rest?

2115
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,861
- Let's solve this. - What?

2116
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:44,130
(He throws away the other part.)

2117
01:26:44,130 --> 01:26:45,630
Did you throw it again?

2118
01:26:45,630 --> 01:26:47,971
It's too late. Let's solve this.

2119
01:26:48,030 --> 01:26:49,030
That's not important.

2120
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:50,731
(Forget about it.)

2121
01:26:50,731 --> 01:26:52,101
I'll throw it away too.

2122
01:26:52,101 --> 01:26:53,700
- Then it's over for us. - That's right.

2123
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:55,240
Tell me what it is.

2124
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,511
You found out the answer.

2125
01:26:56,511 --> 01:26:57,511
(Tell me the answer.)

2126
01:26:57,710 --> 01:26:59,740
What's the opposite word for ramyeon?

2127
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:01,851
(What's the opposite word for ramyeon?)

2128
01:27:01,851 --> 01:27:04,420
What are you talking about? That's not the right spelling.

2129
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:05,851
Tell me what it was.

2130
01:27:05,851 --> 01:27:08,021
What's the opposite word for genius?

2131
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:10,490
What's the opposite word for innate?

2132
01:27:10,651 --> 01:27:12,521
Stop lying. It can't be "innate".

2133
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:15,330
You must have seen all the syllabuses...

2134
01:27:15,361 --> 01:27:17,130
for you to say that.

2135
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:18,931
Tell me what it said.

2136
01:27:18,931 --> 01:27:20,301
Tell me clearly.

2137
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:22,401
- It said "the above". - What?

2138
01:27:22,401 --> 01:27:23,401
"The above".

2139
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:25,641
What's the opposite word for the above?

2140
01:27:25,641 --> 01:27:26,700
- Are you sure? - Yes.

2141
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:28,141
It said "the world".

2142
01:27:28,141 --> 01:27:29,941
(He keeps giving wrong words.)

2143
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:36,111
(He's desperate for hints.)

2144
01:27:36,111 --> 01:27:39,250
(Everyone else except Haha answered correctly.)

2145
01:27:40,151 --> 01:27:45,120
(He must solve the picture to complete the password.)

2146
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:47,521
Is it underworld of ants?

2147
01:27:47,521 --> 01:27:49,261
(Is it underworld of ants?)

2148
01:27:49,261 --> 01:27:51,761
What does it mean by "rules"?

2149
01:27:51,761 --> 01:27:53,460
(Is it underworld of rules?)

2150
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:55,571
- "Talking underworld"? - "Talking underworld"?

2151
01:27:56,670 --> 01:27:57,870
What else is there?

2152
01:27:57,870 --> 01:27:59,670
(So Min's nickname is...)

2153
01:27:59,670 --> 01:28:02,040
Didn't I call you that?

2154
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:03,271
Type in "talking underworld".

2155
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,141
- I did. - It's wrong.

2156
01:28:05,210 --> 01:28:07,410
It's not talking underworld.

2157
01:28:07,410 --> 01:28:08,950
(It's a wrong answer.)

2158
01:28:11,851 --> 01:28:13,981
There are four rules.

2159
01:28:14,151 --> 01:28:16,051
- It's roulette. - There are four rules.

2160
01:28:16,051 --> 01:28:17,051
It makes a roulette.

2161
01:28:17,691 --> 01:28:20,561
Roulette, rules, and Russia.

2162
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:22,761
What can it be?

2163
01:28:22,761 --> 01:28:27,200
(What does it mean by four rules?)

2164
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:30,771
Kwang Soo is unluckiest with roulettes.

2165
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,740
(Are four rules related to Kwang Soo?)

2166
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:35,740
Goodness.

2167
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:36,941
(Are four rules related to Kwang Soo?)

2168
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:40,311
What does Russia have to do with rules?

2169
01:28:41,051 --> 01:28:42,311
It's Russian roulette.

2170
01:28:42,311 --> 01:28:44,210
(It must be the answer.)

2171
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:49,521
(The one word that everything indicates is roulette.)

2172
01:28:49,521 --> 01:28:52,221
Type in "roulette".

2173
01:28:53,061 --> 01:29:00,231
(Russian roulette, four rules, roulette-shaped pizza, Kwang Soo)

2174
01:29:00,231 --> 01:29:07,101
(All of them are related to roulette. Is it the right answer?)

2175
01:29:11,511 --> 01:29:12,511
It's correct.

2176
01:29:12,511 --> 01:29:16,950
("Roulette underworld" is the correct answer.)

2177
01:29:17,981 --> 01:29:21,420
(Now So Min and Jae Seok must run for the money bag.)

2178
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:23,321
We got it.

2179
01:29:23,321 --> 01:29:25,021
- So Min. - Wait.

2180
01:29:25,391 --> 01:29:27,321
(The first to grab the bag wins 50 dollars.)

2181
01:29:27,321 --> 01:29:29,130
- Wait. - Hey.

2182
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:31,200
- What's going on? - Open the door.

2183
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:35,830
(Did they get the correct answer?)

2184
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:36,971
Someone unlocked the door.

2185
01:29:37,670 --> 01:29:38,670
How did they do it?

2186
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:39,670
(He has no idea.)

2187
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:41,740
(Russian flag, Russian roulette)

2188
01:29:42,941 --> 01:29:44,111
(Four rules, roulette)

2189
01:29:45,111 --> 01:29:46,111
(Pizza is roulette-shaped.)

2190
01:29:47,611 --> 01:29:48,681
(Kwang Soo is unlucky with roulettes.)

2191
01:29:50,611 --> 01:29:51,750
(Roulette)

2192
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:53,750
(Roulette underworld)

2193
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:58,361
- Hey, stop. - Wait.

2194
01:29:58,361 --> 01:30:02,261
(They struggle for the bag.)

2195
01:30:02,261 --> 01:30:03,361
Stop it.

2196
01:30:05,401 --> 01:30:06,401
(She misses it.)

2197
01:30:07,261 --> 01:30:10,630
(Jae Seok touches the bag.)

2198
01:30:10,630 --> 01:30:13,941
- Wait a minute. - Jae Seok wins the money bag.

2199
01:30:13,941 --> 01:30:15,340
- How could you? - Who?

2200
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:17,441
- Is it me? - Goodness.

2201
01:30:17,441 --> 01:30:21,080
Door number two is open.

2202
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,080
So Min.

2203
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,321
(I'm sorry, So Min.)

2204
01:30:26,021 --> 01:30:29,321
(Jae Seok wins 50 dollars of mission money.)

2205
01:30:31,061 --> 01:30:32,561
Was it roulette underworld?

2206
01:30:32,561 --> 01:30:35,261
- Roulette underworld. - That was the answer.

2207
01:30:36,061 --> 01:30:38,931
It seemed like soccer with World Cup in Russia.

2208
01:30:38,931 --> 01:30:42,301
(Other members enter the mysterious room.)

2209
01:30:43,101 --> 01:30:45,870
We guessed underworld of flies instead.

2210
01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:47,441
- I guessed... - I didn't think of roulette.

2211
01:30:47,441 --> 01:30:50,571
it was talking underworld.

2212
01:30:50,571 --> 01:30:53,240
(The door closes.)

2213
01:30:54,210 --> 01:30:58,580
(Doors start to close.)

2214
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:03,450
(They're being firmly locked.)

2215
01:31:04,490 --> 01:31:08,960
(What is going on here?)

2216
01:31:09,431 --> 01:31:11,030
Now,

2217
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:13,731
we'll start the final race.

2218
01:31:13,830 --> 01:31:16,700
You're currently imprisoned in Roulette Underworld.

2219
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:19,200
(You're currently imprisoned in Roulette Underworld.)

2220
01:31:20,571 --> 01:31:24,941
(This room is Roulette Underworld.)

2221
01:31:25,141 --> 01:31:27,710
There's a roulette on every wall.

2222
01:31:27,710 --> 01:31:29,151
(Roulettes are on all four walls.)

2223
01:31:29,151 --> 01:31:32,521
The roulettes will determine all of your decisions.

2224
01:31:32,521 --> 01:31:33,620
- I see. - Okay.

2225
01:31:34,891 --> 01:31:37,120
You're currently imprisoned in Roulette Underworld.

2226
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:39,691
You can't escape before clearing the mission.

2227
01:31:41,061 --> 01:31:42,160
- So Min. - What's going on?

2228
01:31:42,761 --> 01:31:43,761
What's going on?

2229
01:31:43,761 --> 01:31:45,660
- Why are the lights out? - This is scary.

2230
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:46,830
(What kind of place is it?)

2231
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:50,731
(Roulette Prison)

2232
01:31:51,101 --> 01:31:53,870
(Welcome to Roulette Underworld.)

2233
01:31:53,870 --> 01:31:55,840
(Someone is hidden in the darkness.)

2234
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:58,441
(Pursue the one who created Roulette Underworld.)

2235
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:01,750
(Unless you escape, you'll be punished.)

2236
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:04,321
(And)

2237
01:32:04,321 --> 01:32:07,120
(Will it be paradise or torture?)

2238
01:32:07,691 --> 01:32:10,221
(Determine the destination and members)

2239
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:13,321
(Who will go where?)

(People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent)

2241
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:20,231
(Wooden cable car in Indonesia)

2242
01:32:20,231 --> 01:32:23,101
(So Min and Kwang Soo are selected to be penalized.)

2243
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:28,941
(They go to Indonesia, the land of promise.)

2244
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:36,710
(They stand in front of a frightening cable car.)

2245
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:40,990
(It's extremely dangerous.)

2246
01:32:40,990 --> 01:32:43,950
(It's impossible to predict.)

2247
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:47,521
(They go on a dangerous cable car ride.)

2248
01:32:48,490 --> 01:32:52,301
(What will happen to them?)

2249
01:32:52,801 --> 01:32:55,200
(Dreadful Final Race)
