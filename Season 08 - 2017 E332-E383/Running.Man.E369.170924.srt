1
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:07,349
(2017 Running Man's 3rd Global Project)

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,720
(Half and Half Tour)

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,219
(Salar de Uyuni is nature's biggest and clearest mirror.)

4
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,190
(Bora Bora is Venus' island located in the South Pacific Ocean.)

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,960
(Rome is the eternal city that has the history of the Roman Empire.)

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,429
(Antelope Canyon is a sandstone formation created by rain and wind.)

7
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:27,070
(Alaska is the home of extreme sports and aurora.)

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,070
(Lake Hillier is a romantic lake that is made pink by plankton.)

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,170
(Bow River lets the visitors enjoy fly fishing in the Rocky Mountains.)

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,070
(Krabi is a fantastic vacation spot where the sky and sea connect.)

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,579
(Did you think there'd be only paradise ahead of you?)

12
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:44,450
(There are also hideous vacation places which the staff recommended.)

13
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:49,289
(8 recommendations from the members and 8 recommendations from the crew)

14
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,619
(Each week, the members have a match to put their names on the roulette.)

15
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:57,200
(First destination turned out to be the Nevis Swing in New Zealand.)

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,270
(Jae Seok, the icon of penalties, got Nevis Swing in New Zealand.)

17
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,929
(Second destination was...)

18
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:05,939
(Bora Bora, the fantastic vacation spot, which Haha recommended.)

19
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:07,269
I really want to go.

20
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:11,780
(So Min, the icon of luck, got Bora Bora.)

21
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,579
(Haha and Z Young won the third race.)

22
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:16,719
(Third destination came to be...)

23
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,290
(Rome, the city that holds the history and beauty of Ancient Rome.)

24
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:25,260
(Jae Seok became the lucky member to go on a trip to Rome.)

25
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,060
(And)

26
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,060
(The final race of Half and Half Project)

27
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,959
(Roulette Underworld)

28
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,469
(Their fates will be determined only by spinning roulettes.)

29
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,540
(The last match between the Running Man members and the staff)

30
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,840
(What will be the final destination, and who will be chosen to go there?)

31
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,269
(It'll be revealed today.)

32
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:46,280
(The final race of Half and Half Project)

33
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,549
All right, everyone. We'll start the final race.

34
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,549
You are currently stuck in the Roulette Underworld.

35
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,349
(Roulette Underworld?)

36
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,790
(The identity of this room is...)

37
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,730
(Roulette Underworld.)

38
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:04,530
You'll find roulettes on each wall.

39
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,930
(There are roulettes on each wall.)

40
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,270
All your decisions today will be determined by those roulettes.

41
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,300
- Is that so? - I see.

42
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,169
There are a total of four rounds.

43
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:14,770
You'll win the race...

44
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,479
if you secure 300 dollars until the race ends.

45
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,909
(The members will win if they keep 300 dollars.)

46
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:23,180
(In other words, they will get to win only if they retain the money.)

47
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,819
If it's less than 300 dollars, the staff will win the race.

48
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,889
(The last destination depends on the 300 dollars.)

49
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:32,990
You will escape from the room every time you clear each mission.

50
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,689
You'll be given a chance to obtain additional money.

51
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:36,699
(If they clear each mission, they get to obtain money.)

52
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,969
If you fail the mission, you must pay a 10-dollar fine.

53
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:42,830
(They have to pay 10 dollars per failure.)

54
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,969
(It's important for them to succeed each mission and raise more money.)

55
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:46,539
We need to get out of here first.

56
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:48,469
And the one with the most amount of money will be the winner.

57
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:49,909
- Yes. - That's right.

58
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:51,740
(Also, the member with the most amount of money will be the winner.)

59
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,580
This week again, the member who acquired the most amount of money...

60
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,949
will get to buy a name sticker and stick it on the roulette.

61
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,319
Among the four entries,

62
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,389
the winning team's destination will be placed on the three entries.

63
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:05,060
And the losing team's destination will be placed on the other entry.

64
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:09,460
You will choose 1 of those 4 entries to decide on the last destination.

65
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,460
Okay.

66
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,699
(What's written on the chosen entry will be the last destination.)

67
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:17,439
(Which vacation spot will be picked as the last destination?)

68
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,710
Before we begin the race, we'll draw the candidates.

69
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,610
I have a question. Will we have another tour project after this one?

70
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:27,479
I'll have to think about it.

71
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,909
Something like Die and Live Project.

72
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:29,949
(Die and Live Project)

73
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,219
- Go Crazy Project. - "Go Crazy Project".

74
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:33,650
Go Insane Project perhaps?

75
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,849
- Go Again Project. - I see.

76
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,159
- I Got Fooled Project. - Goodness.

77
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,259
You can't do another tour project similar to this.

78
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,930
- Please draw the balls. - Do I start?

79
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,729
- Okay. - From this one or that one?

80
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You pick it.

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,030
(Draw it, Jae Seok.)

82
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,169
- Right, Jae Seok. - Good.

83
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:50,800
- Since I already have two slots. - Go ahead.

84
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,069
In this Half and Half Project, Jae Seok broke...

85
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:56,680
all the unlucky records Kwang Soo had made.

86
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,939
- He broke them all. - Right.

87
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:00,180
- I feel a bit upset. - Right.

88
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,210
He made so many good scenes.

89
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,909
- I always look far ahead. - Is that right?

90
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,379
He tends to deal with trivial things.

91
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,020
- What do you mean? - You really do.

92
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,750
- Listen, fellow. - What?

93
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,289
- I don't see anything different. - Goodness.

94
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:11,189
- Goodness. - You silly.

95
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:13,189
Plan big like I do.

96
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:14,830
(What's going to be his plan for today?)

97
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,660
I want to go to the Bow River in Canada.

98
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,769
Right, that sounds good.

99
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,230
I've never been to Canada before.

100
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:28,910
(The magnificent view of the Rocky Mountains)

101
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:34,279
(The visitors enjoy fly fishing in the great nature.)

102
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,649
- I didn't see it. - Gosh.

103
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:37,750
- There. - That's it.

104
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,680
- Please. - 1, 2, 3.

105
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,189
- Three. - Please. Let it be Canada.

106
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:42,189
(He's desperate.)

107
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,930
(Which vacation spot will be the destination candidate?)

108
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:51,000
- That's also a nice place. - This one's good too.

109
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,100
(Krabi in Thailand)

110
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,939
(Krabi is a fantastic vacation spot where the sky and sea connect.)

111
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:03,209
(It will become the last destination on the roulette if the members win.)

112
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:05,079
(I recommended this place.)

113
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,279
- It's close. - I recommended the place.

114
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,649
(All right. Let's win and put it up on the roulette.)

115
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:13,819
- It's Krabi. - This doesn't really matter.

116
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:15,750
(This isn't important.)

117
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,360
- That one's important. - It's no big deal.

118
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,920
- This one's important. - The staff's recommendation.

119
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,689
- This... - Take it out.

120
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:22,829
- Take it out. - Choose one.

121
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:24,629
- I took this ball out. - That's not the one.

122
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,629
- Choose the opposite one. - The opposite of what you decided.

123
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:29,329
(Did you forget already?)

124
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,269
The opposite one.

125
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:32,470
(What's this about?)

126
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,769
I choose even...

127
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:36,980
(A few weeks ago, Jae Seok managed to overcome his bad luck...)

128
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,180
(by choosing the opposite of his decision.)

129
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:43,779
(That's how he set his creed after 7 years.)

130
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,949
(Being careful)

131
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:47,990
The opposite...

132
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:49,290
of this ball.

133
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,259
(He follows his creed as it's important.)

134
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:53,529
The opposite. I'll draw the one at the corner.

135
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:57,399
- Do it again. - Draw the opposite of the opposite.

136
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,759
Jae Seok, how about you draw it with your left hand?

137
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,069
- Okay. - Good.

138
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,269
- That's a good move. - Left hand.

139
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:04,240
- Se Chan, you're good. - Use your left hand.

140
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,839
You know what's funny?

141
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,839
There's nothing good in here anyway.

142
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,740
(They're the staff's recommendations.)

143
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,009
- It's going to be bad anyway. - Still.

144
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:14,350
(Whatever they choose...)

145
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:20,120
(will be a fire pit like this anyway.)

146
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,389
Still, we need to avoid the worst. Something that involves...

147
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:23,389
- height. - Right.

148
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:24,459
(Touching)

149
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,860
- Height. - Right.

150
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:28,329
(Change your decision.)

151
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:30,259
(You're always unlucky.)

152
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,959
(Just draw again.)

153
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,970
(I know, right?)

154
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,269
Make a final decision.

155
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:41,269
Think as if it's the last choice which you can make.

156
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,009
Don't change it now.

157
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:45,180
Jae Seok. That's what you picked a second ago.

158
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,180
(Hold on a second.)

159
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,449
You picked the same ball.

160
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,819
- He's helpless. - Look, Jae Seok.

161
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,689
(They want to avoid the worst.)

162
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:56,819
Hit this hand.

163
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:58,720
How about you draw it with your mouth?

164
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,430
He can't put his head in there.

165
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,730
(After thinking hard,)

166
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,759
(he finally chooses one.)

167
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,000
- That's it. - Let's go with it.

168
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,360
- Let's go with it. - Right.

169
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,769
- I'll open it now. - Do it.

170
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:08,069
1, 2, 3.

171
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:12,800
(The staff's recommendation matters more to the members.)

172
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:18,339
(It should be better than the others.)

173
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,949
What is that?

174
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,449
(It's Cage of Death in Australia.)

175
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,750
(Frightening date with a cannibal crocodile)

176
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:32,620
(They must put up with the extreme fear in front of them.)

177
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:35,430
Is it about crocodiles? Australia?

178
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,660
(Sighing)

179
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:41,000
(The frightening Cage of Death is selected.)

180
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,430
- It's about crocodiles, right? - Well...

181
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,540
We'll be in a cage made with glass. Crocodiles can't come in.

182
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,839
Right?

183
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,439
Hit its nose if it comes in.

184
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,379
(Jae Seok, hit its nose.)

185
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:52,579
- It's possible for you. - So Jae Seok's going?

186
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:54,579
(Is Jae Seok going there?)

187
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,209
Why do you think I'll be going there?

188
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,980
I have this feeling that you'll go.

189
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,680
(It's because you already have the half of the roulette.)

190
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,689
This is it.

191
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:02,790
We haven't even gone to receive the penalties yet.

192
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,759
This is so stressful.

193
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,160
- I have to go next week. - Me too.

194
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,329
It's driving me crazy.

195
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,560
Do you realize how stressful it is?

196
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,930
- I feel like I'm being chased. - What did we do so wrong?

197
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,029
Don't choose us to go with you, all right?

198
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:16,399
- We're getting penalties anyway. - I know.

199
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,540
Today's theme is deciding on which place he'll go.

200
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,209
(It's going to be about deciding where he will go.)

201
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,240
Right.

202
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,579
Please don't choose us to go with you.

203
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:26,009
Everything will depend on you.

204
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:27,350
- Save us. - You never know.

205
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,850
You never know whose name will be written on the last slot.

206
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,149
It may be So Min or you. You never know.

207
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,720
I'm going to Indonesia.

208
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,190
We've done picking the destination candidates.

209
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,519
- Cage of Death. - All right.

210
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,889
The candidates are Krabi in Thailand...

211
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,929
and Cage of Death in Australia.

212
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,059
(Krabi versus Cage of Death)

213
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:48,870
We'll begin today's race now.

214
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:53,470
The first mission of Roulette Underworld is called...

215
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,440
Dreadful Hands.

216
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,639
(1st round of Roulette Underworld: Dreadful Hands)

217
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,009
- What is that? - Dreadful Hands.

218
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:02,879
(What is the mission about?)

219
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,620
The mascot of Running Man,

220
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,220
Mr. Kim Hyung Jun, please come on out.

221
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,250
(Mr. Kim Hyung Jun, please come on out.)

222
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,620
Mr. Kim Hyung Jun.

223
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,259
(Is he here again?)

224
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:16,330
My goodness, he's back.

225
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,830
- Hello. - Hello.

226
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,629
(The master of sports massage, Kim Hyung Jun)

227
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,470
(He is a sports massage therapist from the netherworld.)

228
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,679
(He stimulates the members' limbs with his electrifying hands.)

229
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,750
His thumbs became bigger.

230
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,879
- They became thicker. - His thumbs became thicker.

231
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,250
(He is back with upgraded weapons.)

232
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,919
Please take good care of our aching bodies.

233
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,519
I have a stiff shoulder.

234
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,320
If you withstand the massage for more than 10 seconds...

235
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,159
without making a sound, the mission is a success.

236
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,830
I can't do that.

237
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,529
Spin the roulette to decide on...

238
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:57,139
the number and members.

239
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:03,980
(Don't forget that this is Roulette Underworld.)

240
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:05,980
I will spin the roulette.

241
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,279
Haha is relatively lucky in this project.

242
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,820
- 1. is a good number. - 1.

243
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,720
- 1. - 1.

244
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,990
- Spin the roulette. - Please.

245
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,620
- One. - He spun it well.

246
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,720
I have a good feeling about this.

247
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,690
One.

248
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,659
(They lose 10 dollars if they fail the mission.)

249
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:24,129
(A small number gives them a higher chance of success.)

250
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:25,399
- It's one. - No.

251
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:28,429
It's one.

252
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:32,340
(If they get 1, only 1 member needs to succeed.)

253
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,370
- No, no. - It's one.

254
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,870
- No, no. - Hey, hey.

255
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:43,480
(To which number is the first roulette headed?)

256
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,379
This is crazy.

257
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,850
No.

258
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,789
I can't believe we got seven.

259
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,919
No.

260
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,889
- Why did you spin the roulette? - I can't believe we got seven.

261
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,460
Seven members will participate in the mission.

262
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,159
This is unbelievable.

263
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,899
- That's everyone except for one. - Move out of the way.

264
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:03,200
Haha always sends people...

265
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,740
into peril.

266
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,710
- He only cares about himself. - You are a jerk.

267
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:10,710
- You are an utter jerk, too. - You are a jerk.

268
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,480
(Haha takes responsibility and tries the dreadful hands first.)

269
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,009
- I will go first. - What's the order?

270
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,279
- This can be the order. - Okay.

271
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:19,419
- I'll massage behind your head. - The back of his head.

272
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,919
Let me get a taste of it.

273
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,919
Get the most out of the massage.

274
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,460
It's very painful.

275
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,590
(He gets a taste of the massage.)

276
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,389
It's painful.

277
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,429
(My goodness.)

278
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:33,429
- It's painful. - Is that the massage?

279
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:35,169
I've gotten massaged there before. It hurts.

280
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,870
It's connected to your bones.

281
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,340
(Pressing)

282
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,169
- Wait a minute. - It relaxes your neck.

283
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:41,769
Will you use this much strength?

284
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,340
- No, I will use more strength. - He will use more strength.

285
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,909
- Give me a taste of your strength. - Should I use more strength?

286
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:47,710
How do you normally do it?

287
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,750
This is how I normally do it.

288
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,120
(Hitting)

289
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,049
(How dare you?)

290
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:55,350
Why did you attack him with your elbow?

291
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,620
(I am already worried.)

292
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,559
Let him massage the front of your shoulders.

293
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:00,490
I won't be able to withstand it.

294
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,190
- Try it anyway. - We need to succeed.

295
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,830
Where do you want to get the massage?

296
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,399
My hips.

297
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,799
Spin the roulette to decide whether you can get that massage.

298
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:11,740
(Let's spin and find out.)

299
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,509
Will it be the front of his shoulders?

300
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:16,409
It's a good tool.

301
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:18,409
It's a good tool for making a decision.

302
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:19,909
- There is no need for a fight. - You are right.

303
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:21,379
It will bring us closer.

304
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:22,409
What are we doing?

305
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,120
- O is the front of the shoulders. - O is the front of the shoulders.

306
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,149
- What about X? - X is the hips.

307
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:28,850
(He spins the roulette for the mission.)

308
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,389
Every household should have a roulette.

309
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:33,320
That's a good idea. It can help indecisive people.

310
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,730
It will eliminate fights in the family.

311
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:41,600
(Why am I spinning the roulette?)

312
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,570
(The roulette says yes.)

313
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,700
The front of the shoulders.

314
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,009
- Let's go. - The front of the shoulders.

315
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:49,240
I am warning you that I might fail.

316
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,379
You need to withstand the pain. You came this far.

317
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:53,080
You are the one who chose seven.

318
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,980
You are the one who got us into this mess.

319
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,919
- Ready... - Wait a minute.

320
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,690
Please let me bite down on something.

321
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,919
(Put something in my mouth.)

322
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,789
I am already in pain.

323
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:05,860
- All right. - That's a good idea.

324
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,090
- All right. - There we go.

325
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,629
- Get ready. - That's a good idea.

326
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:10,029
Set, go.

327
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:14,000
(Haha gets started with Dreadful Hands.)

328
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,169
It's okay. You can do this.

329
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,769
It's okay. You can do this.

330
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:21,809
(Haha is silent so far thanks to his members.)

331
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:25,110
- 5, 6. - You can do this.

332
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,049
- Seven. - He is so ugly.

333
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:29,210
(He needs to remain silent for 10 seconds.)

334
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,620
Okay. You are almost done.

335
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,450
Okay.

336
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:36,289
(Haha succeeds.)

337
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:37,990
- You did a good job. - It's no joke, right?

338
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,460
(Screaming)

339
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,889
(Screaming)

340
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:45,500
Everyone should get it on their shoulders.

341
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:48,000
- Who will go next? - Kwang Soo.

342
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,600
- You will die. - Kwang Soo should go next.

343
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,470
Go ahead. You saw me withstand it.

344
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,110
- I have weak shoulders. - I withstood the pain.

345
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,179
Let me get it on the back of my head.

346
00:13:58,179 --> 00:13:59,740
The back of your head? Okay.

347
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,750
(Kwang Soo chooses the back of his head.)

348
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,710
- Get ready. - The back of the head.

349
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,779
May I go with my pelvis?

350
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:06,720
- The back of your head is fine. - Isn't this a vital point?

351
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,850
No, it isn't.

352
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,919
You need to loosen the muscles.

353
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:10,259
My mind is going hazy.

354
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:11,919
- Your head will clear. - My head will clear.

355
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:12,919
Yes.

356
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,259
Get ready. Set, go.

357
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:16,830
(Kwang Soo gets started.)

358
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,000
You are almost there.

359
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:21,070
- Kwang Soo. - You are almost there.

360
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,070
(The acupressure makes his head clear and his mind hazy.)

361
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,399
You are almost there.

362
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:25,539
(He has 3 seconds to go.)

363
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:27,240
(Whimpering)

364
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,769
- You are almost there. - You are almost there.

365
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,240
He made a sound.

366
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,179
- Did he make a sound? - He didn't make a sound.

367
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,480
Didn't you withstand the pain?

368
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,610
To be honest... Listen to me.

369
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,450
Kwang Soo, I was getting ready.

370
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,649
I can't believe you.

371
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:41,289
Give up 10 dollars.

372
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:43,320
- Give up your money. - Listen.

373
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,720
Let the roulette decide whether Kwang Soo should pay.

374
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,190
(Shall we spin the roulette again?)

375
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:52,700
Wait a minute.

376
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,769
Why can't I see well?

377
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,740
This is what we will do.

378
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:00,570
- Since this is Roulette Underworld, - How many people should pay?

379
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,240
let the roulette decide how many should pay.

380
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,080
Don't spin it in that direction.

381
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,549
Jae Seok, let the roulette decide who should spin it.

382
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:10,980
- Right. - That's ridiculous.

383
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,220
- It's only fair. - Ji Hyo is right.

384
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,320
- This is Roulette Underworld. - Ji Hyo, you are right.

385
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:19,389
- What are you talking about? - Let the roulette decide.

386
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:20,730
- We are a team. - In that case,

387
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:23,029
spin the roulette to decide who will spin it.

388
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:25,899
Let's first decide who will spin the roulette.

389
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:28,730
Spin this roulette to choose a member.

390
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,539
All of us should grab the board.

391
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:31,700
- Let's spin it together. - That's right.

392
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,669
Is there an end to this?

393
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,039
Is there an end to this?

394
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,139
Think about why this is called Roulette Underworld.

395
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:42,980
One person can spin the roulette while we hold our hands.

396
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,450
Let's do that.

397
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,019
- This is ridiculous. - Spin the roulette.

398
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:48,519
We are connected.

399
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,190
There is no need for a fight. We will become closer.

400
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,389
(The roulette united the members.)

401
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:55,659
- I want to go in this direction. - I want to go in this direction.

402
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:56,929
Let's spin the OX roulette.

403
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:58,700
- O is left. - Spin the OX roulette.

404
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,870
O is left, and X is right.

405
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,370
- O is right. - O is right.

406
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,539
X is left.

407
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:06,600
Why do you get to spin it?

408
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,710
- We must let the roulette decide. - Come here.

409
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,970
- We must let the roulette decide. - That's right.

410
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,409
Go with it.

411
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,139
- No. - Go with it!

412
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,409
That's unfair.

413
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:16,580
- Right. - Right.

414
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,379
(They need to spin the roulette to the right.)

415
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:19,720
Why did he spin it?

416
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,549
- Hurry up, and hold hands. - It's this direction.

417
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:23,149
Why are we holding hands?

418
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,590
I don't understand why we are holding hands.

419
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:32,730
(Nevertheless, they hold hands to spin the roulette.)

420
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,200
(Jong Kook is chosen.)

421
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,429
- Jong Kook. - Shall I spin the roulette? Okay.

422
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:40,570
Were we choosing a member who would spin this roulette?

423
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,940
- Yes. - Get out of the way.

424
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:43,980
- Was it necessary? - Today,

425
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,009
the shoot will drag out.

426
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:49,279
Who should pay 10 dollars? Kwang Soo or us?

427
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,679
Let's settle the matter with the OX roulette.

428
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:52,919
That's so sudden.

429
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,389
What's the point of what we did so far?

430
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,389
(What was the use?)

431
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,289
Who should pay 10 dollars? Kwang Soo or the 6 members?

432
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:01,830
- Do I pay everything if we get O? - Yes.

433
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,029
What's the point of what we did so far?

434
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,230
- We should do this. - Kwang Soo pays if we get O.

435
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,529
- That's right. - You made a sound.

436
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,299
- Kwang Soo needs to pay. - What?

437
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:11,569
It's O.

438
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,240
(The roulette decides that Kwang Soo will pay 10 dollars.)

439
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,210
- Are you gangsters? - Don't say that.

440
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,349
- It was a fair decision. - We decided with a roulette.

441
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,079
We decided with a roulette.

442
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,980
- Do I really need to pay alone? - This is Roulette Underworld.

443
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,589
(Welcome to Roulette Underworld.)

444
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:31,589
- This is Roulette Underworld. - That's right.

445
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:32,789
- Come to your senses. - That's right.

446
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:34,789
- How could you forget? - You shouldn't learn from him...

447
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:37,430
when you have been on the show for seven years.

448
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,630
- Wait and see. - "Wait and see"?

449
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,970
- See what? - We are seeing.

450
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,539
- See what? - See what?

451
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,710
(Slapping)

452
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,970
Pay up.

453
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,839
This is Roulette Underworld.

454
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,579
(Roulette Underworld is terrible.)

455
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:55,009
Here is 10 dollars.

456
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,779
We are thinking about ordering...

457
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,819
- some food. - Okay.

458
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:04,420
- Who needs to use the toilet? - Me.

459
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:07,230
Choose one person who will go to the toilet.

460
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,700
(Choose one person who will go to the toilet with a roulette.)

461
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,559
- What? - Don't do that.

462
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,069
- You can't do that. - Give us diapers then.

463
00:18:15,069 --> 00:18:16,970
- This is ridiculous. - Does that mean it's okay...

464
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,240
if we relieve ourselves in the studio?

465
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,240
I can pee here.

466
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,039
(Or else, I will pee here.)

467
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,240
So Min, don't do that.

468
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,779
- Please stop. - You are doing well.

469
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:29,880
That's my style. You are doing well.

470
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,619
- That's the way to go. - You can pee here.

471
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:34,789
It's good to take off your clothes and lay down on the floor.

472
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:38,819
Decide on the number of people who will go with the roulette.

473
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,289
We need to use the roulette to go to the toilet.

474
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:41,430
We aren't free to pee?

475
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,930
Will you blur the body parts if we pee in the studio?

476
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,700
- We will blur it. - Will you clean up after us?

477
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,069
May we use a bucket?

478
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:49,029
- I don't have a problem with it. - I don't mind...

479
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:51,539
- peeing in the studio. - That's the purpose of the layout.

480
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,440
We can go in there to pee.

481
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:55,339
Isn't that a prison?

482
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:57,039
Do you want us to go there?

483
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,839
Isn't this a detention center?

484
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:01,710
(Those who haven't been picked by the roulette, come.)

485
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,079
(There is an open-bathroom prepared at the corner of the Underworld.)

486
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,720
But we ought to pee where there are doors to close.

487
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,849
That's right.

488
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,160
We need to pee in a bathroom that has doors.

489
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,029
(This built-in bathroom protects your privacy.)

490
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:16,029
- That's right. That's nice. - Of course.

491
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,529
- There are doors. - We just need to get number eight.

492
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:19,559
- Did you spin it? - I really need to go.

493
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,799
(Come on. Hurry.)

494
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:21,900
I really have to go to the bathroom.

495
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,299
- I need to go too. - They shouldn't do this.

496
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:26,069
(So Min spins the roulette as she urgently has to go.)

497
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:27,509
- If we get 8, all of us can go. - 8?

498
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,609
(The roulette will choose the number of members who will get to pee.)

499
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:31,009
I really need to go to the bathroom.

500
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:32,839
(The roulette will choose the number of members who will get to pee.)

501
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,380
(How many members will get to go to the bathroom?)

502
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,579
- So Min, why did you spin it? - Why did you spin the roulette?

503
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:38,319
- Only two of you will go. - So Min.

504
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,650
You cannot spin it again. Only two of you will go.

505
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,019
(2 members can go to the bathroom.)

506
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,819
- Let me go. - Only two will go.

507
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:44,460
- Will we spin the roulette again? - Hey, hey.

508
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,259
- We'll spin it to see who will go. - All right. Only two of us will go.

509
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,730
- But I really need to go. - You can't go yet.

510
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,059
I will spin it since I said I had to go to the bathroom first.

511
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,369
I've been holding it in since this morning.

512
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:55,069
- Only two of us will get to go. - Whoever is picked can go, right?

513
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,470
- Yes. - But I need to go.

514
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,539
(Even their chance of peeing depends on the roulette.)

515
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:05,009
(Most of the members have been holding it in.)

516
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:06,140
- Jong Kook. - He doesn't even need to go.

517
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,210
(Jong Kook, who doesn't even need to go, is selected.)

518
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,319
- He doesn't even need to go. - He doesn't have to go.

519
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,480
I don't have to go though.

520
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,220
I'll go since I'm selected.

521
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,890
- Can he sell the ticket? - You should sell the ticket to us.

522
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,490
- Then I will... - You may sell the ticket for money.

523
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,089
Then I will sell you the ticket to the bathroom.

524
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,630
We have to spin one more time for another member.

525
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,900
- We have to spin it again. - No, no. I should spin it.

526
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,329
- Please select my name. - All right.

527
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:33,410
(They lost a chance to Jong Kook who doesn't even need to pee.)

528
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:39,240
(Their names must be chosen for them to go to the bathroom.)

529
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,880
(So Min, who has to go most urgently, is chosen.)

530
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,779
It's So Min. So Min is picked.

531
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:47,049
Thank you. I'll be back.

532
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:51,519
So Min and Jong Kook can go to the bathroom. Wait, hold on.

533
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:59,130
(They are in despair as their bladders can't hold it in anymore.)

534
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,799
Jong Kook, what do you want to do?

535
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,369
- Will you give it to someone else? - I'm going to sell this.

536
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:04,700
- For how much? - For 10 dollars.

537
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,240
(The price is 10 dollars.)

538
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,369
10 dollars?

539
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:08,769
- It's 10 dollars. - I don't have 10 dollars.

540
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,309
- You're so greedy. - I ought to get 10 dollars for it.

541
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:13,109
Then people who don't have money can't go to the bathroom?

542
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:15,079
- This is too harsh. - That's why we have tickets.

543
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,579
Are you being serious right now?

544
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:19,319
We're going to pee on the walls.

545
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:21,819
Oh, no. I really have to...

546
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:23,250
(What on earth is she doing?)

547
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:25,819
(Undressing)

548
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:28,259
- Hey, hey. - Go. You should go!

549
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,559
(Gosh, just go already.)

550
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,900
(We knew she was crazy, but we didn't think she'd be that crazy.)

551
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,029
Hurry.

552
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:36,500
Did I see that right?

553
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,670
No, what you saw really happened.

554
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,869
She is...

555
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:41,210
too extreme.

556
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,910
- Hurry. - I'll be back.

557
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:46,079
(I had no choice. I really have to pee.)

558
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,109
Where is the bathroom? Where do I need to go?

559
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,920
Which way is to the bathroom? I have to go now.

560
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,750
(Where is the exit? She's in a hurry.)

561
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,960
Where is the entrance?

562
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,160
(We gave you a chance to go, but why can't you go to the bathroom?)

563
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:02,890
There isn't a bathroom here.

564
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,029
(She was about to return to the Underworld she just escaped from.)

565
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,769
Thank you.

566
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:09,269
The bathroom. I must go to the bathroom.

567
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,299
Oh, my. It's surrounded by...

568
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,000
It's so hard to go to the bathroom.

569
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:14,809
There's no way out of this place.

570
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:15,839
(She runs at full speed to the bathroom.)

571
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,039
Where is the bathroom?

572
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,210
Hello.

573
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,579
(She sees the bathroom at last!)

574
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:23,309
- The bathroom. - Hold on.

575
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:25,319
(Hold on.)

576
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,819
What? There's a fee?

577
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:33,490
(There's another roulette here? Why is this roulette here?)

578
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,589
What? There's a fee?

579
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,329
(She can't just go to the bathroom.)

580
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:38,900
Before you go to the bathroom,

581
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,269
you must spin the roulette.

582
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:44,240
The roulette will decide whether it's free or not.

583
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,470
But you didn't tell us about this before the shoot.

584
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,180
Had you told me this earlier, I would've gone to the bathroom.

585
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:54,180
(She bites the bullet and spins the roulette.)

586
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,349
I need to go now.

587
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,579
I need to go now.

588
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:04,490
(She has to pay in order to pee.)

589
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,559
(Don't mess with my bladder right now.)

590
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,160
Please give me a discount. Let me pay two dollars less.

591
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,359
That can't be done.

592
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:15,500
Unbelievable.

593
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,440
You just wait and see. Mark my words.

594
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,940
(I'm only going since I need to pee now.)

595
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,369
- Hey. - Give me six dollars.

596
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:23,539
Please give me a discount.

597
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:26,309
- How can I give you a discount? - Let me just pay three dollars.

598
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:29,579
Then don't go. I'll just go to the bathroom.

599
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,319
- If you don't want to pay. - But you don't have to go.

600
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:33,690
I'll just go for a walk then. It's stuffy in here.

601
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,849
You're going for a walk?

602
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:37,220
But right now, I have a big problem down here.

603
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,660
(His bladder is about to explode.)

604
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,490
If you do, you should just pay.

605
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:44,900
- Think about your health. Right? - We are in an underworld after all.

606
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:48,430
But seeing Jae Seok peeing his pants isn't a good sight.

607
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,529
(Just pay 10 dollars for it.)

608
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:50,799
What's wrong with that? I'll get a lot of attention.

609
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,910
(What's so bad about that?)

610
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:57,039
- You want to generate buzz? - These days...

611
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,079
That's great.

612
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,750
Come on. Go borrow money.

613
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,049
I'll pay you six dollars.

614
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,319
Then don't go. I'll go for a walk.

615
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,880
- Hold on. - Why?

616
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:07,990
- Let him just go for a walk. - Exactly. I'll just go.

617
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,160
Both of you should hold it in. That's fair.

618
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,420
- Hold it in. - To be honest, I need to poop.

619
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,759
(Please let me go. I have to poop.)

620
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:15,859
I'm serious.

621
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:18,299
- If so, you need to pay more. - In that case, pay me more money.

622
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:21,369
- It's at least 10 dollars then. - Why did you tell him that?

623
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:25,099
- You should pay more then. - What are you doing?

624
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,599
Okay. I won't go.

625
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,039
Let's see what happens.

626
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,240
(Kwang Soo gives up.)

627
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,380
- It's fine by me. - I'll pay you six dollars.

628
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,140
- Six dollars? I'm going then. - He's not going to bid now.

629
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,910
- Let me pay 6 dollars for it. - Pay 7 dollars.

630
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,779
- I have three dollars now. - Think about it.

631
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:38,279
- He lowered it to 7 dollars. - I gave you a discount.

632
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:40,349
- Okay. I'll pay you 7 dollars. - Okay. Pay me 7 dollars.

633
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,460
- It's surrounded like an island. - I'll be back.

634
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:46,059
Goodness. Which way is the exit?

635
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,529
- Have fun at the bathroom. - Jae Seok, good luck.

636
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,299
- I went to the bathroom. - Yes?

637
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,730
They want me to spin the roulette in front of the bathroom.

638
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:55,170
- What? - Seriously?

639
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:56,700
- Why? - To see if you'll pay a fee or not.

640
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,869
- Gosh. This is unbelievable. - You paid at the bathroom?

641
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:01,410
- I had to pay 5 dollars. - You paid 5 dollars?

642
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,680
- I should hold it in then. - They're such jerks.

643
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,279
(These jerks who call themselves the crew...)

644
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:09,279
The roulette will decide whether it's free or not.

645
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,579
- What on earth are you saying? - You may spin the roulette.

646
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,789
I already paid seven dollars to come here.

647
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:15,089
But you must spin the roulette.

648
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,160
But I already paid seven dollars.

649
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,559
(But you're in the Roulette Underworld.)

650
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:21,490
(Had I known, I would've peed my pants.)

651
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,660
For goodness' sake.

652
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,400
(Had I known, I would've peed my pants.)

653
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,900
You want me to pay more after I paid Jong Kook seven dollars?

654
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,930
(He's dumbfounded.)

655
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,200
I can't believe this is happening.

656
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,440
(Since it's the rule, Jae Seok spins the roulette.)

657
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,509
Please.

658
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:39,440
(No way! Jae Seok gets to use the bathroom for free.)

659
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:47,990
(After much struggle, he manages to not cause a scene.)

660
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:50,759
(Jae Seok comes back with an empty bladder.)

661
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,089
Did you pay five dollars or not?

662
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:53,359
- What? - Did you pay?

663
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,230
- You spun the roulette, didn't you? - Of course I did.

664
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,390
- What did you get? - Did you pay?

665
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,700
I peed for free.

666
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:01,069
- Okay. - Great job.

667
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:03,440
Does this deserve an applause?

668
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,670
Jae Seok, I paid though.

669
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:07,269
- She paid 5 dollars. - I paid 5 dollars.

670
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:09,069
(Of course it's praiseworthy. I had to pay 5 dollars.)

671
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,240
(Kwang Soo paid 10 dollars since he failed the mission.)

672
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,980
(So Min paid 5 dollars to use the bathroom.)

673
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,980
(The current sum of their mission money is 285 dollars.)

674
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:17,480
You had a chance to go to the bathroom.

675
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,779
I feel so much better now.

676
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,089
We thought you'd be hungry by now. We'll order Chinese food.

677
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,289
(Gosh, I'm hungry. We have to eat.)

678
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:27,529
- Hold on. - We have to do this right.

679
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,759
- They won't just feed us for free. - Let's spin the roulette well.

680
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:30,460
Whatever happens, we must eat.

681
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,529
- I think they'll make us spin it. - I want jjamppong rice.

682
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,200
I want jjamppong.

683
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,230
I want two helpings of jajangmyeon.

684
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,069
- Two helpings of jajangmyeon. - I want...

685
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:38,740
seafood jjamppong rice.

686
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:41,670
- I want jajangmyeon in a tray. - Seafood jjamppong, please.

687
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,410
Let's order tangsuyuk.

688
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,279
- Under whose name will you order? - It's under Seok Jin's.

689
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:48,650
- It's under Seok Jin's. - No, no.

690
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,049
- Seok Jin will order it. - No, all of us are ordering it.

691
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:52,380
- Seok Jin will order it. - Everyone can order one dish.

692
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,690
Seok Jin, order it for us.

693
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,150
You want me to treat you all?

694
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,420
- I heard your stock price went up. - You ought to buy us a meal.

695
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,690
- You look great when you eat it. - I really want to eat it.

696
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:03,799
- It will be under my name, right? - First off...

697
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:04,900
- Yes. - Put it under my name.

698
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,829
You want tangsuyuk instead of jajangmyeon in a tray.

699
00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:09,130
- All right. - Okay.

700
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,640
We'll continue with Lunch Roulette for your lunch mission.

701
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:16,609
(Lunch Roulette? Goodness, it never stops, does it?)

702
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,980
You'll spin the number roulette to decide how many of you will eat.

703
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,279
Don't you think you should just let us eat?

704
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,019
- We need number eight for this. - This is too cruel.

705
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:27,089
If we get number one, it'll be a big problem.

706
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,890
- We must spin it. Let's just do it. - We must be thorough with this.

707
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:32,019
Let's choose who will spin this by the roulette.

708
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,759
We need someone to blame.

709
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,289
I'll choose the name roulette then.

710
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:36,730
- Let Kwang Soo spin this. - Go ahead.

711
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,200
We're going to decide who will spin the number roulette, right?

712
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,400
(Their fate depends on the selected member.)

713
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,029
It's Jong Kook. No, it's me.

714
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:44,869
- Hold on. It's Jae Seok. - No, it can't be Jae Seok.

715
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,140
(Jae Seok, the unluckiest of the unluckiest, is selected.)

716
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,140
(Sighing)

717
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,609
- Jae Seok, spin it. It's okay. - This is driving me crazy.

718
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:50,839
Jae Seok. Someone has to spin it.

719
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,079
- I'll spin this. - Okay.

720
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:54,380
- That unlucky punk. - I'll pick number eight for us.

721
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,680
We must have the mindset that we can overcome this.

722
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,519
- Please, Jae Seok. - Jae Seok.

723
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:00,289
- In 1, 2. - Please pick a good one, Jae Seok.

724
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:01,690
We should at least eat.

725
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,890
(Their lunch depends on his hands.)

726
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,920
- We should at least eat. - Let's get number eight.

727
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:08,230
- This will throw them off. - Let's make the crew flustered..

728
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,960
It's going great. The speed is good.

729
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,829
- I have a good feeling about this. - It's going well.

730
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:13,900
(It's heading to higher numbers?)

731
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,000
- Stop! Stop! - Come on.

732
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:21,670
(They want everyone to eat. Will the wish come true?)

733
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,509
- It's not bad. - It's not bad.

734
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,309
- That's not a bad number. - Good job.

735
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:26,480
(6 members will get to have their lunch.)

736
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,710
It's not a bad number.

737
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,880
- Six of us will get to eat. - That's not a bad number at all.

738
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:31,480
- 6 of us will eat. 2 can't eat. - Only 2 of us can't eat.

739
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,579
- That's all right. - It's only two people.

740
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:34,220
Choose the two members who...

741
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,089
- won't get to eat by the roulette. - We'll choose who can't eat.

742
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,420
(The roulette will decide the 2 members.)

743
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,990
(We won't ever stop spinning the roulettes, will we?)

744
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:42,230
If you spin it and pick your name, I'm going to compliment you.

745
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,299
- Jae Seok, you should spin it. - Okay.

746
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:45,960
Okay. Choose your name. Do it for the greater good.

747
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,529
The member Jae Seok picks will spin next.

748
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:49,599
- Sure, sure. - Okay.

749
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:51,269
(Jae Seok will choose 2 members who can't eat Chinese food.)

750
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:52,869
This member can't eat his or her lunch.

751
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:54,710
- I wonder who it's going to be. - The roulette picks me too often.

752
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,069
Hopefully, it won't be me.

753
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:57,309
- Who is it? - Goodness.

754
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:01,579
- It's Seok Jin. - Seok Jin can't eat tangsuyuk.

755
00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:03,210
- He can't eat it. - Spin the roulette, Seok Jin.

756
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,220
Spin it.

757
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,690
You're useless in my life.

758
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:09,789
I won't forget the two of you.

759
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,059
- The person I had in mind... - Don't jump.

760
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,390
got selected.

761
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,730
I hope it's one of you two.

762
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,029
(He selects the last person who won't be eating Chinese food.)

763
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:21,630
The person I had in mind got selected.

764
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,700
I hope it's one of you two. Let it be Jae Seok.

765
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:27,109
(Will it be either Jae Seok or Kwang Soo?)

766
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:28,940
- It won't work. - It's Haha.

767
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,539
- Is it Ji Hyo? - No way.

768
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,410
(Will it be Ji Hyo...)

769
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:35,380
(who won't be eating tangsuyuk?)

770
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,279
- Is it Ji Hyo? - No way.

771
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,920
- It's Kwang Soo. - It's him.

772
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,619
(Kwang Soo is selected.)

773
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:44,019
(Yes, I get to eat.)

774
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:47,130
Okay, this is great.

775
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,130
It was one of the two.

776
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,829
We won't order jajangmyeon for Kwang Soo.

777
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:54,569
- Aren't you grateful? - He was so excited.

778
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:58,069
- He was so excited. - He's such an annoying brat.

779
00:29:58,099 --> 00:29:59,640
(He regrets being annoying.)

780
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:02,910
We'll order food except for the two.

781
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,579
Won't we get to eat?

782
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,279
- Is there an option to pay? - Again?

783
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,880
(He can't use the restroom or eat.)

784
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:12,220
(You don't look so good, Kwang Soo.)

785
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,849
Kwang Soo is breaking out into a cold sweat.

786
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:16,859
Does your stomach hurt, Kwang Soo?

787
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,589
I'll accept the challenge.

788
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:20,230
I wanted to treat everyone.

789
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,230
I really have to poop.

790
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,289
Pay the money and use the restroom.

791
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:24,500
I really have to poop.

792
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,000
I'll give you a dollar.

793
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,799
If I pay, can I use the restroom any time?

794
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,839
(Please let me go before it's too late.)

795
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:36,210
(Suddenly...)

796
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,680
(the lights go out.)

797
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,710
- What happened? - Did lights go out?

798
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,980
- I'm scared. - What's going on?

799
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:42,210
What's going on?

800
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,420
What's happening?

801
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,220
- I'm scared. - Come on.

802
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,519
- Don't do this. - What's going on?

803
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,920
- I can't see anything. - Why did the lights go out?

804
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,660
Is everyone leaving?

805
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,890
- Shall we go out? - What?

806
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:53,930
(While everyone discusses for a solution...)

807
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,329
(What?)

808
00:30:55,329 --> 00:30:56,390
What are you doing?

809
00:30:56,829 --> 00:30:58,359
What were you trying to do?

810
00:30:58,359 --> 00:30:59,900
(What were you up to?)

811
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,599
(The lights turn on again.)

812
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,900
(They see him standing alone.)

813
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,839
I think he's on a mission.

814
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:05,869
(He makes it obvious.)

815
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:07,910
- Are you on a mission? - That must be it.

816
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:09,910
- That's not true. - Explain to us.

817
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:12,380
- I was... - What were you trying to do?

818
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:15,079
Since Haha has the most amount of money,

819
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,720
- To steal his money? - I was about to steal it.

820
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,049
(He was about to steal Haha's money.)

821
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:21,789
Are you admitting it?

822
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:24,220
I don't want you to think that I'm on a mission.

823
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,220
Why are you the only one standing?

824
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,829
I was about to steal Haha's money.

825
00:31:27,829 --> 00:31:28,930
Sit back down.

826
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,460
From Seok Jin's mission money,

827
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,839
60 dollars were taken and given to the Designer.

828
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,039
(Given to the Designer?)

829
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:42,369
(Why was my mission money...)

830
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:43,509
(given to the Designer?)

831
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:45,039
Did you take away 60 dollars from me?

832
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,079
- 60 dollars? - I don't have 60 dollars.

833
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,950
- Why? - The Designer?

834
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:52,579
(What does it mean?)

835
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,319
From 33 dollars of Seok Jin's money,

836
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:57,420
60 dollars were taken.

837
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,519
- You have negative 27 dollars. - Negative?

838
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,230
- Did you take 60 dollars? - Yes.

839
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,690
- All at once? - The 60 dollars...

840
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,630
were given to the Designer.

841
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,029
Why is it 60 dollars?

842
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:09,029
- What's the reason? - Did you say something?

843
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,140
- What's the reason? - He must have said something.

844
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:14,970
The Designer who designed Roulette Underworld is sitting among you.

845
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,910
(One of us...)

846
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,839
(is the Designer.)

847
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:22,009
- I knew it. - One of us is the Designer.

848
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:23,480
My goodness.

849
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,950
(I knew something was wrong.)

850
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,750
Goodness.

851
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,650
(Someone wants to steal our mission money.)

852
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,690
Who is it?

853
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:33,160
If the Designer carries out the hidden mission,

854
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,289
he or she can take other members' mission money.

855
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:38,259
You must figure out the identity of the Designer...

856
00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:40,069
and the hidden mission.

857
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:43,000
If you guess correctly,

858
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:45,339
the Designer fails the hidden mission.

859
00:32:45,569 --> 00:32:47,509
All the money that the Designer has accumulated...

860
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:50,309
will be equally given out to the rest of the members.

861
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:52,109
(Members get an equal share.)

862
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:54,009
(It's a psychological battle...)

863
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:56,109
(between those who steal and those who protect their money.)

864
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:59,619
(The Designer versus Running Man)

865
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:01,420
- By the way... - I'm bad at guessing.

866
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,660
- Do we have to guess who? - I'm bad at guessing.

867
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:06,220
What did I do? It's Jae Seok.

868
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,789
Jae Seok suddenly became quiet.

869
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:09,990
- That's true. - Right.

870
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,660
Didn't he suddenly become quiet?

871
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,799
Here's what's funny.

872
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:16,299
The lights came back on too early.

873
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:18,039
He froze while standing up.

874
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,269
- He was the only one. - Goodness.

875
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,210
Kwang Soo is good at designing.

876
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,009
- He's good at pulling tricks. - In the past,

877
00:33:24,009 --> 00:33:26,039
- I designed a maze. - Right.

878
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,549
It was a huge mess.

879
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:30,680
So Min, why do you look upset?

880
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,420
It's because...

881
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,920
when the lights went out,

882
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:37,220
I acted similarly to Jae Seok.

883
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:40,690
I moved my arm to steal someone's wallet,

884
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:43,859
but Kwang Soo wasn't in his seat.

885
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:45,099
- I was standing. - He was.

886
00:33:45,099 --> 00:33:47,500
I extended my arm, but he wasn't there.

887
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:50,240
When the lights came back on, he was sitting here.

888
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,900
Is there one Designer?

889
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,269
There may be multiple.

890
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:55,210
There's only one Designer.

891
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,910
(There's only one Designer.)

892
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,279
Is there only one?

893
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,849
There are two members who aren't allowed to eat.

894
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,880
- Isn't that why it's 60 dollars? - That's right.

895
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,390
(As 6 members get to eat, the amount is 60 dollars.)

896
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:09,420
The arrow is pointing at six.

897
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,889
Six members get to eat.

898
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,690
It must be 10 dollars per person.

899
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:13,760
That's why it's 60 dollars.

900
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,190
- By the way... - This is it, everyone.

901
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,929
It's Seok Jin and number six.

902
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:19,659
It's Seok Jin and number six.

903
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:21,369
- Does that mean... - He's right.

904
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:22,900
(The roulettes point at Seok Jin and number six.)

905
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:25,269
(Wait a minute.)

906
00:34:25,269 --> 00:34:28,739
Why is it pointing at my name when it was Kwang Soo before?

907
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:29,739
Right?

908
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:31,610
(The roulette...)

909
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:34,480
(indicates a different member.)

910
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,949
(When Seok Jin spun the roulette,)

911
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,650
(Kwang Soo was selected.)

912
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,519
(When the lights came back on,)

913
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:44,820
(the target changed to Seok Jin.)

914
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,630
It means that Kwang Soo stood up...

915
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,860
- and spun the roulette. - I'm getting goosebumps.

916
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,300
- That makes no sense. - I'm getting goosebumps.

917
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:54,630
- That's right. - That's why...

918
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,769
he wasn't there when So Min moved her arm.

919
00:34:56,769 --> 00:34:59,840
That's why 60 dollars were taken from Seok Jin.

920
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,239
Why would I spin it?

921
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:05,780
Jae Seok kept saying that he's the Designer.

922
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:08,579
It could be a method to trick us.

923
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:10,949
- He's capable of doing that. - Definitely.

924
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:12,320
He intentionally admits that it's him.

925
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,789
We narrowed down our choices. It's definitely one of them.

926
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:19,260
Jae Seok and Kwang Soo seem suspicious.

927
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,260
Right.

928
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,900
(Is either Jae Seok or Kwang Soo the Designer?)

929
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,500
Here's the next mission.

930
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,300
It's called Dreadful Pirate.

931
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,099
- Pirate? - Are we playing it again?

932
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:34,110
It's so cute.

933
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,110
(It's a miniature pirate.)

934
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:37,610
There aren't many knives.

935
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,380
- There are eight. - There aren't many slots.

936
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,610
There aren't many knives.

937
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:43,309
Spin the roulette to determine...

938
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,079
how many should succeed.

939
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,849
You must also decide...

940
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:48,889
how many knives to stick in.

941
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,989
This is amazing.

942
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:53,260
There are only eight slots.

943
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:55,829
You're eliminated automatically if you get number eight.

944
00:35:56,289 --> 00:35:58,500
- Please spin the roulette. - Okay.

945
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500
- Give it a try. - Go, Se Chan.

946
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,900
One person is good.

947
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,599
- 1 is the best. - 1 person is the best.

948
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,869
Let it be number one.

949
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:06,500
(The smallest number...)

950
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,739
(means the maximum amount of gain.)

951
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:12,380
- It looks good. - Keep spinning.

952
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,150
- No. - It's number one.

953
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,409
(Will it be a small number...)

954
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:18,820
(that all the members want?)

955
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,320
- It passed. - It's two people.

956
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,019
Two members is good.

957
00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:25,019
(Two members are selected.)

958
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,130
(They gain additional mission money if two members succeed.)

959
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,730
It's possible for two members to succeed.

960
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,730
(She feels the need to do something.)

961
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,730
I'll spin next.

962
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,699
(What's going on?)

963
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:39,269
(What's with her enthusiasm?)

964
00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:43,110
(Don't stop me. I feel lucky.)

965
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,110
So Min.

966
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:46,949
(Something seems suspicious.)

967
00:36:46,949 --> 00:36:48,610
(Trust me.)

968
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,619
It might work.

969
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:52,949
(Will it be a small number?)

970
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:54,690
- Is it 5? - It's 4.

971
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,690
(She gets four.)

972
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,320
(They must stick in four knives.)

973
00:36:58,219 --> 00:36:59,920
(If they succeed, they gain mission money.)

974
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,360
- Four knives? - I trust you, So Min.

975
00:37:02,989 --> 00:37:04,260
Stay calm, So Min.

976
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,630
(She starts to stick the knives in.)

977
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,670
One.

978
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,869
- 2. - 2.

979
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:11,369
We're half way there.

980
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:13,099
- 3. - This is the last one.

981
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:14,110
(She sticks three in safely.)

982
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:16,469
(There's one remaining.)

983
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:18,010
(If So Min succeeds...)

984
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,880
You can do it, So Min.

985
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,380
(Only one more person has to succeed.)

986
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,579
You're doing well.

987
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:25,679
Okay.

988
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,389
(So Min succeeds.)

989
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:29,920
(Great job, So Min.)

990
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:33,219
(There's only one member left to go.)

991
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:37,000
Jong Kook wants to do it.

992
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,099
(I will...)

993
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:40,300
(put an end to this game.)

994
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,469
(If Jong Kook succeeds,)

995
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:45,500
(they can win additional mission money.)

996
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,500
(In order to succeed,)

997
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,510
Here I go.

998
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:51,380
(it must be a small number.)

999
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,849
- Come on. - Look.

1000
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:54,849
- It's one. - That's it.

1001
00:37:54,849 --> 00:37:56,210
- Is it 1? - It's 2.

1002
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,280
(Two is selected.)

1003
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,820
(He must stick in two knives.)

1004
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:03,659
(Great job, Jong Kook.)

1005
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:06,519
- Good job. - If Jong Kook succeeds,

1006
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,760
- we clear the mission. - Right.

1007
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,090
Turn it once.

1008
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,099
- Like this? - Yes.

1009
00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:11,099
Did it work?

1010
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:15,369
(Is...)

1011
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:16,469
(this...)

1012
00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:17,699
(real life?)

1013
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,739
(The game ends...)

1014
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:22,210
(in vain.)

1015
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,210
Come on.

1016
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,409
(How could he? They were so close.)

1017
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,010
(Kicking)

1018
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,010
Goodness.

1019
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:30,420
Gosh.

1020
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,389
- We were so close. - Kwang Soo.

1021
00:38:33,889 --> 00:38:35,750
Why did you have to ruin it?

1022
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,760
What?

1023
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,719
(They fail to gain additional mission money.)

1024
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,860
What?

1025
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,159
(At that time,)

1026
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,230
(the lights go out again.)

1027
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,530
Here it is.

1028
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:46,460
(The lights go out.)

1029
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,599
(It means the Designer is on the move.)

1030
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,829
- No. - Don't spin the roulette.

1031
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:51,000
(It means the Designer is on the move.)

1032
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,739
- Who was it before? - Where is it?

1033
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:55,039
- Kwang Soo. - What's the number?

1034
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,639
(The designer's plan is exposed.)

1035
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:57,880
- Someone is here. - Who is this?

1036
00:38:57,909 --> 00:38:59,110
- Who is this? - Se Chan.

1037
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,849
- There are so many in the front. - Who are you?

1038
00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:01,980
(What traces will the designer leave behind?)

1039
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,079
- It's Kwang Soo. - It's Kwang Soo.

1040
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:08,690
(Meanwhile, on the other side where the roulette is placed...)

1041
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:10,519
(What? Did he just move the roulette?)

1042
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:13,989
- You're here. - Sorry?

1043
00:39:13,989 --> 00:39:15,860
(He's flustered.)

1044
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,099
It's Kwang Soo.

1045
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,699
(It looks like he has a lot to say.)

1046
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,699
Why are you standing over there?

1047
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:23,070
(Why are you there? You look suspicious.)

1048
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,940
- What? You were all there. - You couldn't hear?

1049
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:26,710
I couldn't even see.

1050
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,769
- Kwang Soo. - It's Kwang Soo.

1051
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,309
Kwang Soo is the designer.

1052
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,340
That's right. It is Kwang Soo.

1053
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,650
- Kwang Soo, you were behind this? - Kwang Soo is the designer.

1054
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:39,949
(The designer exposed himself just like that? That was too easy.)

1055
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:42,420
(Is Kwang Soo, who seems too obvious, the designer?)

1056
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,960
(A day before the shoot)

1057
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:47,289
(Preliminary meeting with the crew)

1058
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:49,059
(Is the designer Kwang Soo?)

1059
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:50,760
(Yes, Kwang Soo...)

1060
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,130
(is the designer...)

1061
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,699
(as expected.)

1062
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,670
(The designer who got exposed within 2 hours has entered.)

1063
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:01,170
We had a meeting with the message...

1064
00:40:01,269 --> 00:40:02,610
you sent us before.

1065
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,809
(What message?)

1066
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:09,079
I didn't mean anything by it. I didn't know it'd be a big thing.

1067
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,250
You had a meeting.

1068
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,789
(Do I have to face the penalties? It will take me a year to do all.)

1069
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:16,920
I faced every penalty.

1070
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,719
I had to go to the Labyrinth and Indonesia to face the penalties.

1071
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:21,260
I was never excluded from the penalty, not even once.

1072
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,860
Just as you said, you're always chosen to face the penalty.

1073
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,900
And for that, we do sympathize for your suffering.

1074
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:31,599
So we have prepared a hidden mission for you.

1075
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:34,139
(A hidden mission?)

1076
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:36,739
Kwang Soo, tomorrow, you will be...

1077
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,280
the designer who constructed the set for the Roulette Underworld.

1078
00:40:39,909 --> 00:40:42,849
(You will be the designer who built Roulette Underworld.)

1079
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,920
In the set,

1080
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:48,849
there are a number roulette and a name roulette.

1081
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:52,590
During the shoot, when there are unexpected blackouts,

1082
00:40:52,889 --> 00:40:54,659
without getting caught,

1083
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:57,530
you may adjust the name and number roulette to your liking.

1084
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:01,230
You can earn mission money during the blackouts.

1085
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,900
I will get to keep the money?

1086
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,440
Yes. In other words, the rest of the members must uncover...

1087
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,570
the designer and what the hidden mission is.

1088
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,210
If they fail to do so, it's your win.

1089
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:14,780
You will keep the mission money and be exempted from being chosen.

1090
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,150
(He will earn money and be exempted.)

1091
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,550
(I'll be exempted?)

1092
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,849
(This is his last chance not to be chosen as the trip companion.)

1093
00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:25,119
- The members can't choose me? - No, they cannot.

1094
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,659
If I win, I will not face the penalty.

1095
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:27,730
Exactly.

1096
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:28,760
(This is amazing.)

1097
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,630
We are giving you a special opportunity...

1098
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,030
- since you were always chosen. - Thank you.

1099
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,429
We have high hopes for this project.

1100
00:41:36,699 --> 00:41:39,769
But there was one time I completely ruined the episode with the maze.

1101
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:41,869
I mean...

1102
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:44,280
(He's reminded of his past once again.)

1103
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:47,809
(The crew had prepared a special for Kwang Soo with a high budget.)

1104
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:50,119
(Are you the spy? Are you?)

1105
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:52,619
(He was suspected from the start.)

1106
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:55,619
(And he was punished gravely.)

1107
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:57,519
(This was his opportunity to take his revenge.)

1108
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:01,130
(Whenever the crew prepared a special episode for him,)

1109
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:04,000
(he was the prime suspect and suffered greatly.)

1110
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,199
(And during these episodes prepared for him,)

1111
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:11,000
(he was always ruined.)

1112
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,610
(His painful past refreshes his memory.)

1113
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:17,179
I'm grateful, but could this work?

1114
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:19,909
We're very worried now that you don't seem confident.

1115
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:25,320
(This special is making us worry about you and ourselves as well.)

1116
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,550
I don't think I can pull this off.

1117
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,920
(Sir, I can't do this.)

1118
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,619
I can't do this. This is giving me a lot of pressure.

1119
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:34,960
This is such a big project.

1120
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,960
(We did it since you asked.)

1121
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:38,429
I just need to be careful of Jong Kook.

1122
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:40,469
(He's worried about Jong Kook.)

1123
00:42:40,469 --> 00:42:41,800
Does he still have gout?

1124
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,469
We'll see you tomorrow.

1125
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:46,300
- I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay.

1126
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,269
(He exited as he worries about all sorts of things.)

1127
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:49,769
Do you want to sleep over at my house tonight?

1128
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:52,340
I'm so nervous.

1129
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,809
(He had shaky eyes. Why didn't we see this coming?)

1130
00:42:54,809 --> 00:42:58,349
(That this project was destined to fail in vain.)

1131
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:00,789
(They saw.)

1132
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:02,519
(They caught.)

1133
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:04,690
(And they ended.)

1134
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,789
(The crew is in a crisis.)

1135
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:09,260
(He smiles as he pretends he's not.)

1136
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,159
All right, Kwang Soo's mission money,

1137
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:14,500
30 dollars, will go to the designer.

1138
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:16,699
He's giving money to himself.

1139
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,070
(Kwang Soo has been exposed. Will there be a twist?)

1140
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:24,409
I was just informed that your lunch has arrived.

1141
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:26,179
We'll give you your lunch.

1142
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,650
What are you doing? Why are you putting your hand on me?

1143
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,320
That didn't mean anything.

1144
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,849
- His hand was on me for too long. - Who did that?

1145
00:43:33,849 --> 00:43:35,250
- Kwang Soo put his hand on me. - That's nothing.

1146
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,889
Is there something on my name tag? Check.

1147
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,360
He's worrying over nothing.

1148
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,030
- I bet he's exhausted today. - Nothing is on it?

1149
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:41,130
(I'm so tired.)

1150
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:44,130
- I agree. It's hard for Kwang Soo. - He keeps...

1151
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:48,570
(You little...)

1152
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:50,800
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1153
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,940
(He slaps Jong Kook out of frustration.)

1154
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,510
- Hey. - I was just imagining this.

1155
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:58,880
- Go, and get yourself checked out. - I'm really sorry.

1156
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,480
- I'm sorry. - He's unbelievable.

1157
00:44:00,949 --> 00:44:02,710
I'm sorry. I couldn't hold it in.

1158
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:04,949
Can we eat now?

1159
00:44:04,949 --> 00:44:06,280
- You may eat now. - All right.

1160
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,019
Turn the metal container around.

1161
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,989
- What is this? - It's a roulette again.

1162
00:44:09,989 --> 00:44:11,059
(There's a roulette on this too?)

1163
00:44:11,059 --> 00:44:12,460
Goodness, this is too much.

1164
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:13,829
(I'm sick of Roulette Underworld.)

1165
00:44:13,829 --> 00:44:15,590
- Let's spin it. - It's the roulette again.

1166
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:18,260
- Let me spin it. I'm not greedy. - Give it a spin.

1167
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,960
- I'm not greedy over food. - That's right. Spin it.

1168
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,469
He should spin it. You can't do that. Stop it.

1169
00:44:22,469 --> 00:44:26,400
(Since he's not allowed to eat, won't he get lucky?)

1170
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,510
I hope it's free.

1171
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:28,510
(Charged)

1172
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:29,940
- I'm sorry. - I knew he would be unlucky.

1173
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:31,610
I'm sorry.

1174
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,409
(He has committed a grave sin.)

1175
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:37,849
- Each dish will cost... - Wait.

1176
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:41,989
5 dollars, and since you have 6 dishes, we'll collect 30 dollars.

1177
00:44:41,989 --> 00:44:43,019
(Scowling)

1178
00:44:43,489 --> 00:44:45,760
You should just pay.

1179
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,260
We have to choose who will pay.

1180
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,829
(They have 255 dollars left.)

1181
00:44:48,829 --> 00:44:50,199
- Thank you for the food. - This is yours.

1182
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:53,199
- I have jjamppong. - Here's the seafood jjamppong.

1183
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:54,570
I ordered jjamppong rice.

1184
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,699
- I ordered jajangmyeon. - That's mine.

1185
00:44:57,199 --> 00:44:59,070
- Thank you. - Gosh, that one has crabs.

1186
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,710
Seok Jin and I can't eat, can we?

1187
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,570
- Is there a chance for us to eat? - We can't eat it at all?

1188
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:06,639
- That looks good. - I think we can eat that.

1189
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:08,250
Jajangmyeon looks really tasty.

1190
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,349
(Are jajangmyeon and jjamppong pies in the sky for them?)

1191
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:12,619
- Jajangmyeon is tasty. - What are you talking about?

1192
00:45:12,619 --> 00:45:13,989
- Se Chan. - Stop it.

1193
00:45:13,989 --> 00:45:16,050
- I'll help you. - No, don't.

1194
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,989
Just pay back what you owe me.

1195
00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:19,360
I will pay you back.

1196
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,360
- You can eat when you pay back. - This is good.

1197
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,130
- If I pay you back, I can eat this? - And pay a dollar for this.

1198
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:25,630
(There always seems to be debts when Chinese food is involved.)

1199
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:28,699
(He borrowed the money without thinking as he was hungry.)

1200
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:32,000
(With the interest, 1 dollar became 4 dollars.)

1201
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,940
(I'll buy you a carton of cigarettes.)

1202
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,780
(He tried his best not to pay back his debt.)

1203
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:41,849
You haven't paid me back in weeks.

1204
00:45:41,849 --> 00:45:47,090
Can we eat in peace? Why do you keep talking about debts?

1205
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,389
I'm just a third party, but it's making me uncomfortable.

1206
00:45:50,659 --> 00:45:52,719
- That wasn't it. - Goodness.

1207
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:54,590
- But it became four dollars. - Jae Seok is right.

1208
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:55,760
(Mr. Lee with bad credit is hungry.)

1209
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,829
We should eat in peace at least.

1210
00:45:56,829 --> 00:45:58,760
I'll give you four dollars right after I have a sip of the soup.

1211
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:00,469
Do you have money?

1212
00:46:00,469 --> 00:46:02,130
What is this?

1213
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,170
I don't want this. What is this?

1214
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,840
Look at these!

1215
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,269
(He gives her 4 dollars he had in his pocket.)

1216
00:46:07,269 --> 00:46:09,139
- You're horrible. - Stop bringing food to the table.

1217
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:11,679
- What is this? - Real cash means nothing here.

1218
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:13,480
- But this is money. - I need money from the game.

1219
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,050
Forget them. I can't use them here.

1220
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:16,579
Let me have a mouthful with a dollar.

1221
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,719
(They have reached a compromise.)

1222
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:19,980
Can I have some broth?

1223
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,250
(He gets to have a mouthful.)

1224
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,389
(This is his mouthful.)

1225
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:27,530
Kwang Soo, this isn't right. I didn't even get to eat.

1226
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:28,530
(As he picks up a lot of noodles,)

1227
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:33,260
(the pitch-dark blackout has visited the members again.)

1228
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:35,230
- Hold Kwang Soo. - Hold him.

1229
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:37,269
- I got him. - Hold him.

1230
00:46:38,739 --> 00:46:40,469
- Get ahold of him. - I've been here all along.

1231
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:41,670
- Yes? - Hey.

1232
00:46:42,139 --> 00:46:44,610
- Stop eating. - Jae Seok has to pay 40 dollars.

1233
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:47,909
Stop eating it. It's mine.

1234
00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:50,119
(It's over anyway. Let me at least fill my stomach.)

1235
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:51,380
He ate the whole thing.

1236
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:52,750
(Oh, no.)

1237
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:55,150
Give back my noodles!

1238
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:59,920
(He chose food over the mission. The roulettes haven't changed.)

1239
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,159
(I see. Since he's not moving,)

1240
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:05,099
(there's no mention of the designer.)

1241
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,400
(He's the culprit.)

1242
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,769
I can't believe this.

1243
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:12,269
(Can the mission proceed without a hitch?)

1244
00:47:12,269 --> 00:47:13,570
Did you enjoy your meal?

1245
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:14,670
- Yes. - Yes.

1246
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:17,340
The mission is Dreadful Rock-Paper-Scissors.

1247
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:21,110
(The 3rd mission is Dreadful Rock-Paper-Scissors.)

1248
00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:22,780
Everyone...

1249
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,480
will choose 3 cards out of 10 cards...

1250
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,250
as you each take a turn.

1251
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:30,289
You will play rock-paper-scissors with me.

1252
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,760
You must win the number of times the roulette chooses.

1253
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:35,329
We should get one.

1254
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:40,070
Kwang Soo should spin it since he's the architect of this project.

1255
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:42,630
Because he's unlucky,

1256
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:45,070
- he won't get what he wants. - I won't say anymore.

1257
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,039
- There's another... - You can't take this back.

1258
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:48,739
- Okay. - Of course.

1259
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:50,179
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

1260
00:47:50,179 --> 00:47:52,179
- Someone else should spin it. - Let Ji Hyo spin it.

1261
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:55,849
- Move aside. - You're unlucky.

1262
00:47:55,849 --> 00:47:58,519
- Are you serious? - You did well.

1263
00:47:58,519 --> 00:47:59,849
You're not lucky. Move away from it.

1264
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:01,719
- Are you serious? - You did well. Now, come.

1265
00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:04,559
- Move when there's a blackout. - You have to move around.

1266
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,289
(You should move when there's a blackout, not when it's bright.)

1267
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:09,059
- You little... - What?

1268
00:48:09,659 --> 00:48:12,630
- You're done. - "You're done."

1269
00:48:12,829 --> 00:48:14,130
3 or 2 will be great for us.

1270
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:16,329
- 1 is the best number. - 1?

1271
00:48:16,329 --> 00:48:18,599
2 isn't bad since we'll have 10 cards.

1272
00:48:18,969 --> 00:48:21,010
1 is the best, but 2 isn't bad.

1273
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:22,809
1, 2, and 3 aren't bad numbers.

1274
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:24,840
- This looks good. - Number four would be good.

1275
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,949
- It's not bad. You did it. - It's number one.

1276
00:48:26,949 --> 00:48:28,380
- Great. - I knew it.

1277
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,710
Ji Hyo is lucky, indeed.

1278
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,250
- One of us... - Hey, Ji Hyo.

1279
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:33,050
She gets lucky all the time.

1280
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,590
- Three of us have to beat you. - Okay.

1281
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:36,989
Let me go first.

1282
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:38,889
- We'll accomplish this mission. - Of course, we will.

1283
00:48:38,889 --> 00:48:40,730
Just three of us have to win. Don't make us play.

1284
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:43,030
(He's choosing the cards carefully.)

1285
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:45,900
Why don't you finish this mission before Kwang Soo's turn?

1286
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,199
We can't let Kwang Soo see the cards.

1287
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:50,900
He's going to give signals to the crew when he sees our cards.

1288
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,570
- He might wink at them. - Observe him.

1289
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:53,909
- He might wink twice. - The wink means paper.

1290
00:48:53,909 --> 00:48:56,269
I bet he already made signals.

1291
00:48:56,269 --> 00:48:57,980
- Haha, you watched "Tazza". - This is not a team game.

1292
00:48:58,039 --> 00:48:59,579
Close your eyes. Turn around.

1293
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:03,449
(Haha chose 3 cards.)

1294
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:05,619
(The key to success is to use them at the right time.)

1295
00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:06,849
Go.

1296
00:49:07,789 --> 00:49:12,159
(Haha has 2 rocks and 1 paper.)

1297
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,789
- Let's go at rock-paper-scissors. - Sure. Hold on.

1298
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:16,289
I'm not going to see it.

1299
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:17,860
- That's good. - That's a good idea.

1300
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,500
You have to be smarter. Take a chance.

1301
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,429
(Should I do paper or rock?)

1302
00:49:21,429 --> 00:49:23,170
(The director chooses scissors.)

1303
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:24,800
Take a chance.

1304
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:29,869
(If Haha chooses rock, he wins.)

1305
00:49:29,869 --> 00:49:32,380
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1306
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,110
(What did Haha choose?)

1307
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:37,119
Paper

1308
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,949
(Rock)

1309
00:49:38,949 --> 00:49:40,420
- Okay. - Okay.

1310
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,090
(Running Man has 1 win with Haha's victory.)

1311
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:45,559
- Good job. - Nice.

1312
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:47,889
- Great job. - Good.

1313
00:49:47,889 --> 00:49:49,659
Mix them. I have a good feeling.

1314
00:49:49,659 --> 00:49:51,260
Let's finish at Se Chan.

1315
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,130
(Ji Hyo is next.)

1316
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:56,099
- I chose it with So Min. - All right.

1317
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:57,269
Same positions?

1318
00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:59,269
Are they in the same positions?

1319
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:02,070
(2 rocks and 1 paper)

1320
00:50:02,909 --> 00:50:04,280
(He's thirsty.)

1321
00:50:04,579 --> 00:50:05,639
Let's go.

1322
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,679
Rock-paper-scissors

1323
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:09,809
(Ji Hyo wins with paper.)

1324
00:50:09,809 --> 00:50:11,179
I won.

1325
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,349
(Running Man wins 2 times in a row.)

1326
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:17,820
- I won. - He's bad at games.

1327
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,889
- Let's finish this off. - End it, Se Chan.

1328
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:21,829
- I will. - Three cards.

1329
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,300
(Se Chan is next, and Running Man has 2 wins.)

1330
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,099
- Do I pick anything? - Yes.

1331
00:50:26,769 --> 00:50:29,030
(He's careful.)

1332
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:34,170
If he wins, that's our win.

1333
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,409
Yes. This is over.

1334
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:41,480
(The director chose...)

1335
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:45,980
(three rocks.)

1336
00:50:47,389 --> 00:50:51,289
(He's in trouble.)

1337
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:54,760
(This won't do. Today is a bad day.)

1338
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,159
I picked these.

1339
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:59,800
(If Se Chan doesn't have scissors, he can't lose.)

1340
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,699
Rock-paper-scissors

1341
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,900
(The first match is a tie.)

1342
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:04,940
All right.

1343
00:51:05,239 --> 00:51:07,239
Rock-paper-scissors

1344
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:08,909
Scissors

1345
00:51:08,909 --> 00:51:10,239
(Se Chan wins with paper.)

1346
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:11,309
I won?

1347
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:13,650
I won.

1348
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:14,809
(Running Man wins.)

1349
00:51:14,809 --> 00:51:16,280
- I won. - We won.

1350
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,650
- I won. - Good job.

1351
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,949
- Please pick. - I picked these.

1352
00:51:19,949 --> 00:51:23,760
(He picked 2 papers and 1 rock. He couldn't have lost.)

1353
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,789
- Does he only have rocks? - He does.

1354
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:27,690
- He only has rocks. - Why?

1355
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:29,489
- He only has rocks. - How is that possible?

1356
00:51:29,489 --> 00:51:31,730
You know how we all stood up when we won?

1357
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:35,000
Kwang Soo clenched his teeth.

1358
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,369
- Is that right? - He clenched his bottom teeth.

1359
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:39,239
- We won. - We won.

1360
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:42,610
(I'm done today.)

1361
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:44,539
He only has rocks.

1362
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,150
- Is that right? - He clenched his bottom teeth.

1363
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:49,010
- What? - His bottom teeth.

1364
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,050
All right.

1365
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,519
You're not going to high-five me, right?

1366
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,019
Do we get more mission money?

1367
00:51:55,489 --> 00:51:57,619
One person will escape.

1368
00:51:57,619 --> 00:51:59,559
Please spin the roulette to find out who.

1369
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:00,730
- That sounds good. - One person.

1370
00:52:00,789 --> 00:52:02,929
- They have to find it, right? - Let's get it.

1371
00:52:02,929 --> 00:52:04,159
(Who will have to go out and find mission money?)

1372
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:05,429
- Back and forth. - It's Ji Hyo.

1373
00:52:05,429 --> 00:52:07,329
- Good. - This is good.

1374
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:09,000
- Good. It's Ji Hyo. - Go.

1375
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,400
- I'll go. - Ready.

1376
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,769
(She gets 30 seconds.)

1377
00:52:12,769 --> 00:52:15,070
(They must get the lost mission money back.)

1378
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,510
This is so messy.

1379
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,710
The designer must have hid it well.

1380
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:25,250
I should have went. I'm a ghost.

1381
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:29,190
(Kwang Soo looks suspicious while everybody is not paying attention.)

1382
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:36,829
(Why is he holding a tape and heading to the roulette?)

1383
00:52:36,829 --> 00:52:40,969
(Is he trying to change something?)

1384
00:52:40,969 --> 00:52:42,900
Kwang Soo is putting something on.

1385
00:52:47,269 --> 00:52:48,809
(Did you see that?)

1386
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:51,110
Kwang Soo, why are you doing that to Jong Kook?

1387
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:52,880
(What is it?)

1388
00:52:53,809 --> 00:52:55,050
(Sighing)

1389
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:56,179
He's in trouble.

1390
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,420
Why are you sighing?

1391
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,090
I don't know anymore.

1392
00:53:02,019 --> 00:53:05,619
(He doesn't know what to do today.)

1393
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,960
(We don't know either, Kwang Soo.)

1394
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,929
I don't know anymore.

1395
00:53:12,329 --> 00:53:13,570
Whenever you say that,

1396
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:16,670
it feels like something is not going right.

1397
00:53:16,769 --> 00:53:18,469
Is there something?

1398
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,909
Look. Just look.

1399
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:23,039
Jae Seok, there was one left.

1400
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:25,539
- It must be 10 dollars. - It must be.

1401
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:26,750
(There are 10 dollars in the envelope.)

1402
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:27,849
It's 10 dollars.

1403
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:30,219
She's always so lucky.

1404
00:53:30,219 --> 00:53:31,519
- How is she so good? - How much is that in total?

1405
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:33,920
Again?

1406
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,750
(It's dark again.)

1407
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:36,989
- Hold him. - Hey.

1408
00:53:36,989 --> 00:53:38,559
Hold onto him.

1409
00:53:39,489 --> 00:53:43,559
(Kwang Soo is acting suspicious, so they hold onto him.)

1410
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:44,829
- Who's this? - Me.

1411
00:53:44,829 --> 00:53:46,300
- What about this? - Me.

1412
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,429
Hold onto him.

1413
00:53:47,429 --> 00:53:48,469
- I'm here. - That's So Min.

1414
00:53:48,469 --> 00:53:51,170
Seok Jin is on my right, and Kwang Soo is on my left.

1415
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:53,039
- I'm holding Ji Hyo. - Kwang Soo.

1416
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:54,539
- Our hands... - What happened?

1417
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,639
- Nobody moved. I didn't move. - Let's see.

1418
00:53:57,139 --> 00:53:59,679
(Please trust me.)

1419
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:03,650
Jae Seok's 60 dollars...

1420
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:06,079
- was accrued by the designer. - What?

1421
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:12,119
(Kwang Soo didn't move, but Jae Seok's money got stolen?)

1422
00:54:13,929 --> 00:54:15,059
Why is my name there?

1423
00:54:16,829 --> 00:54:22,570
(They held onto Kwang Soo, but the roulette is turned to Jae Seok.)

1424
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:25,400
(The mission money roulette is turned towards 6.)

1425
00:54:26,269 --> 00:54:27,510
(Is Kwang Soo not the designer?)

1426
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:29,639
- I didn't move. - No way.

1427
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:32,539
- You know I didn't move, right? - It's not Kwang Soo.

1428
00:54:32,539 --> 00:54:35,380
(You know I didn't move, right?)

1429
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:39,019
Didn't Se Chan sound far away?

1430
00:54:39,019 --> 00:54:40,519
No, he was next to me.

1431
00:54:40,519 --> 00:54:42,650
- Kwang Soo didn't move this time. - If it's not him...

1432
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:45,460
(Kwang Soo is smiling. What just happened?)

1433
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:49,059
When we play games, they always get suspicious of me.

1434
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:51,099
They always pick me. I think...

1435
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:54,730
I need an advantage.

1436
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:56,429
So...

1437
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:58,940
we have Plan B for you.

1438
00:54:59,269 --> 00:55:02,210
(Plan B?)

1439
00:55:02,739 --> 00:55:06,409
When you press on a member's name tag for five seconds...

1440
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:11,019
and they touch the roulette, the money goes to the designer.

1441
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:13,119
(Kwang Soo has to press down on the name tag.)

1442
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:16,389
(Before the lights went out,)

1443
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:22,289
(Kwang Soo touched Jong Kook's name tag for 5 seconds.)

1444
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:24,500
(He got himself a proxy for spinning the roulette.)

1445
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,000
Why are you doing this? Why is your hand on me?

1446
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:30,000
- That was nothing. - You hand was on me for too long.

1447
00:55:31,639 --> 00:55:35,840
(When Ji Hyo went out to look for mission money,)

1448
00:55:36,369 --> 00:55:43,050
(he waited for Jong Kook to spin the roulette.)

1449
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:50,260
(He spun it without knowing anything.)

1450
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:56,289
(That's how the designer earned 60 dollars.)

1451
00:55:56,289 --> 00:55:58,329
- You know I didn't move, right? - It's not Kwang Soo.

1452
00:55:58,329 --> 00:55:59,530
But...

1453
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:01,500
Kwang Soo breathed weirdly.

1454
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,800
(Kwang Soo breathed weirdly.)

1455
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,969
I held onto him,

1456
00:56:04,969 --> 00:56:06,940
and he asked who I was. I didn't say anything.

1457
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,769
He asked again, and I said it was me.

1458
00:56:08,769 --> 00:56:10,340
Then he sighed like it was nonsense.

1459
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:13,550
It was as if he was saying, "I'm done for."

1460
00:56:13,809 --> 00:56:15,909
You know what type of breath that was?

1461
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:18,050
Okay. Do as you please.

1462
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:19,619
- This is not a team game. - Hey!

1463
00:56:20,389 --> 00:56:22,750
What's on your back?

1464
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:24,260
What?

1465
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,889
(Somebody played around with his name.)

1466
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:27,860
What? What is it?

1467
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:30,429
Look at this punk. You're making it obvious.

1468
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:32,960
- What is it? - Is this your mission?

1469
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,500
(He turns from the designer into a fool.)

1470
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,800
What's this?

1471
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,869
- Is this the mission? - Who did this?

1472
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:39,699
I have no idea.

1473
00:56:39,699 --> 00:56:41,639
(He's not under the radar anymore.)

1474
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:46,809
(Plan B has begun. He has a chance to turn this around.)

1475
00:56:46,809 --> 00:56:50,579
(He has to earn the penalty exemption.)

1476
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:58,489
(Jae Seok is his next target. He has to press his name for 5 seconds.)

1477
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:02,760
(You made fun of me.)

1478
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:06,659
This roulette mission is called Dreadful Marshmallow.

1479
00:57:06,659 --> 00:57:08,900
(Round 4 is Dreadful Marshmallow.)

1480
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:12,670
Jong Kook said marshmallows last in your system for years.

1481
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:13,909
Right.

1482
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:20,449
(He starts pressing down on Jae Seok's name tag.)

1483
00:57:20,949 --> 00:57:25,519
(If I do this for 5 seconds, Jae Seok will come under me.)

1484
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:28,119
(This is his only hope to turn the table around.)

1485
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:29,489
You can roast it.

1486
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:31,019
It's so good when you roast it.

1487
00:57:32,889 --> 00:57:33,889
(Chuckling)

1488
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:40,469
(This secret mission is too obvious.)

1489
00:57:41,969 --> 00:57:43,539
(What's Kwang Soo doing now?)

1490
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,539
(They exchange smiles.)

1491
00:57:47,539 --> 00:57:49,570
(He doesn't know what to do.)

1492
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:54,579
What is it? What's going on?

1493
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:56,449
That was too...

1494
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:58,679
- Is he being too obvious? - It's too...

1495
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,449
I felt it.

1496
00:58:00,449 --> 00:58:01,750
That was too...

1497
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:06,219
(It's as if he's screaming out and saying he's the designer.)

1498
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:09,789
(When he was trying Plan B on Jong Kook)

1499
00:58:09,789 --> 00:58:11,300
Why are you doing this? Why is your hand on me?

1500
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,800
(That was so obvious.)

1501
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,929
That was nothing.

1502
00:58:14,929 --> 00:58:17,369
- His hand was on me for too long. - Who?

1503
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,639
Kwang Soo had his hand on my shoulder.

1504
00:58:18,739 --> 00:58:20,409
Is there something on my name tag? Check.

1505
00:58:20,409 --> 00:58:22,840
(He was nervous from the beginning.)

1506
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,539
There's a disadvantage for Kwang Soo.

1507
00:58:25,909 --> 00:58:29,710
(We are sure Kwang Soo has a mission.)

1508
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,380
I felt it.

1509
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,519
(He's silent.)

1510
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:34,849
I think there's something going on with him too.

1511
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:37,320
(Please help me.)

1512
00:58:38,289 --> 00:58:40,889
(What should I do?)

1513
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:44,329
Let's say Kwang Soo has a secret mission today.

1514
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,360
How many times has he messed up?

1515
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:47,769
Are we filming next week or not?

1516
00:58:47,769 --> 00:58:49,369
Tell me. I was planning a family trip.

1517
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,409
This roulette mission is Dreadful Marshmallow.

1518
00:58:53,409 --> 00:58:54,539
I'm free next week.

1519
00:58:54,539 --> 00:58:56,739
(He calls himself out.)

1520
00:58:57,739 --> 00:59:00,610
(They give him credit for having the courage to say it.)

1521
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,519
(Should we stop for today?)

1522
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:04,679
Keep it up until the end.

1523
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:06,949
This roulette mission is...

1524
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:09,420
Dreadful Marshmallow.

1525
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:11,360
In 30 seconds,

1526
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,559
you must stack three marshmallows in a row.

1527
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,559
Stack them?

1528
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,900
(They have to win this final mission to get more mission money and win.)

1529
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,769
You don't have to stack it like that.

1530
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,940
(Jong Kook goes 1st and fails.)

1531
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,239
(Ji Hyo goes 2nd and fails as well.)

1532
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:28,869
No. That won't work.

1533
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:30,780
- It doesn't work. - Fail.

1534
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,039
(So Min fails, and they lose the mission.)

1535
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:37,250
Half and Half Project Part 4, Roulette Underworld...

1536
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,719
has concluded.

1537
00:59:39,019 --> 00:59:41,320
You have accumulated...

1538
00:59:41,789 --> 00:59:43,719
286 dollars.

1539
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:46,090
- We have to go. - Running Man has lost.

1540
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:48,030
(They couldn't keep 300 dollars.)

1541
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,190
(They can already see the Cage of Death.)

1542
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:51,199
I can't go to Australia.

1543
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:53,829
However, since we won,

1544
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:55,699
there are four exits.

1545
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:58,800
3 exits lead to Cage of Death,

1546
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,039
and one exit is for Krabi.

1547
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:04,239
If you exit through the exit for Krabi,

1548
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:05,239
that goes on the roulette.

1549
01:00:05,239 --> 01:00:06,340
(Whatever they choose will go on the roulette.)

1550
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,510
There are three exits for Cage of Death.

1551
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:10,480
- There's a 25-percent chance. - We get another chance.

1552
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,050
Before that,

1553
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:16,190
it's time to arrest the designer who confused you all.

1554
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:18,789
He didn't confuse us.

1555
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:20,460
(Everybody knows the culprit.)

1556
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,960
We weren't confused at all.

1557
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,699
Please come forward one at a time, and tell me who it was.

1558
01:00:24,699 --> 01:00:28,300
Also, tell me how they took your money. If you're accurate,

1559
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,440
I'll approve.

1560
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:32,840
The designer is Kwang Soo.

1561
01:00:33,139 --> 01:00:34,869
I pick Kwang Soo.

1562
01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:36,239
I think it's Kwang Soo.

1563
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:38,840
The name tag he touches...

1564
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,510
He put his hand on the name tag.

1565
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:43,719
(They know Plan B exactly as well.)

1566
01:00:43,719 --> 01:00:45,480
He pressed down on my back.

1567
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:46,889
(Snickering)

1568
01:00:46,889 --> 01:00:48,690
I think he was too nervous.

1569
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:50,190
I'm sorry.

1570
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:52,719
I'll see you next week.

1571
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:57,130
Let me reveal the answer.

1572
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,699
Today's designer...

1573
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:00,829
was surprisingly...

1574
01:01:01,929 --> 01:01:04,239
("Surprisingly"?)

1575
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:05,239
It wasn't him?

1576
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:08,239
(Is there something unexpected about the designer?)

1577
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:09,710
(Was it someone else other than Kwang Soo?)

1578
01:01:10,569 --> 01:01:12,769
- It was Kwang Soo. - Exactly.

1579
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:14,368
(There's nothing unexpected at all.)

1580
01:01:14,368 --> 01:01:16,808
I thought it wasn't him. You scared me.

1581
01:01:16,808 --> 01:01:18,808
(I thought it wasn't him. You scared me.)

1582
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:20,379
If it wasn't him, that would have been shocking.

1583
01:01:21,049 --> 01:01:23,948
- Gosh. - My heart skipped a beat.

1584
01:01:23,948 --> 01:01:25,078
"Surprisingly".

1585
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:27,848
The person with the most mission money is Ji Hyo.

1586
01:01:27,848 --> 01:01:31,218
(Ji Hyo is in 1st place.)

1587
01:01:31,218 --> 01:01:32,959
It was a dollar difference.

1588
01:01:32,959 --> 01:01:34,928
It's because she found the money.

1589
01:01:35,029 --> 01:01:36,328
- Really? - How much do I have?

1590
01:01:36,328 --> 01:01:37,928
(She won because she found 10 dollars during the mission.)

1591
01:01:38,658 --> 01:01:39,968
We'll have to go there.

1592
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:43,269
- It's a bad place. - I can't go to Australia.

1593
01:01:43,269 --> 01:01:45,669
From a bird's-eye view,

1594
01:01:45,669 --> 01:01:47,609
this is a roulette as well.

1595
01:01:48,109 --> 01:01:50,839
(The set is a huge roulette.)

1596
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:54,279
(It's truly Roulette Underworld.)

1597
01:01:54,808 --> 01:01:55,948
That must look cool.

1598
01:01:55,948 --> 01:01:57,419
(The designer didn't know either.)

1599
01:01:57,419 --> 01:01:59,488
(That must look cool.)

1600
01:01:59,488 --> 01:02:00,519
Is this the center?

1601
01:02:00,819 --> 01:02:02,519
- That's right. - It all connects...

1602
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:05,118
and looks like a circle.

1603
01:02:05,118 --> 01:02:06,529
(She gives a thumbs up.)

1604
01:02:06,529 --> 01:02:08,129
This is awesome.

1605
01:02:08,129 --> 01:02:09,529
(Roulette Underworld)

1606
01:02:10,328 --> 01:02:12,198
Out of the four exits,

1607
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:14,098
Krabi is one of them.

1608
01:02:14,098 --> 01:02:17,839
Cage of Death is on three of them.

1609
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:18,908
(There are 3 bad exits and 1 good one.)

1610
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:21,008
- Do we choose the exit first? - Yes, go ahead.

1611
01:02:21,008 --> 01:02:22,479
Shouldn't it be the door we always used?

1612
01:02:22,779 --> 01:02:23,908
- Exit 4? - I think it's Exit 2.

1613
01:02:23,908 --> 01:02:25,209
I think it's 2 or 4.

1614
01:02:25,209 --> 01:02:26,209
I think it's Exit 2 as well.

1615
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:28,408
Let's spin the roulette and listen to that person.

1616
01:02:28,408 --> 01:02:29,948
All right. Kwang Soo, spin it.

1617
01:02:29,948 --> 01:02:32,049
- Jae Seok. - Designer, spin it.

1618
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:35,419
- All right. - I got it wrong.

1619
01:02:36,058 --> 01:02:37,488
We listen to the person that the roulette lands on, right?

1620
01:02:37,488 --> 01:02:38,488
- That's right. - Yes.

1621
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:39,828
(The chosen person gets to pick an exit.)

1622
01:02:39,828 --> 01:02:44,229
(Who will be the one to decide?)

1623
01:02:44,229 --> 01:02:46,629
It's me. It's Jong Kook.

1624
01:02:46,999 --> 01:02:47,999
Is it me?

1625
01:02:47,999 --> 01:02:51,799
(Is it me?)

1626
01:02:51,799 --> 01:02:52,808
- Which one? - Exit 4.

1627
01:02:52,808 --> 01:02:54,008
- Exit 4. - This one?

1628
01:02:54,008 --> 01:02:55,808
- Yes. - When you go out,

1629
01:02:55,908 --> 01:02:59,549
if there's a red sign that says Cage of Death, it's a penalty.

1630
01:02:59,549 --> 01:03:00,709
(If the floor is red, it's a penalty.)

1631
01:03:00,709 --> 01:03:02,549
If it's Krabi, it's a blue sign.

1632
01:03:02,549 --> 01:03:03,578
(Blue means paradise.)

1633
01:03:03,578 --> 01:03:04,618
Go with your instincts.

1634
01:03:04,618 --> 01:03:06,019
(We made the correct decision, right?)

1635
01:03:06,019 --> 01:03:07,718
- Please. - We want Thailand.

1636
01:03:07,718 --> 01:03:10,459
- If we get Thailand... - If it's Krabi...

1637
01:03:11,718 --> 01:03:18,758
(There's a door between paradise and the underworld.)

1638
01:03:18,758 --> 01:03:23,669
(There's a door between paradise and the underworld.)

1639
01:03:25,299 --> 01:03:28,008
(There are 3 reds and 1 blue. Which one is Exit 4?)

1640
01:03:28,008 --> 01:03:30,109
Will Exit 4 be...

1641
01:03:30,109 --> 01:03:33,279
Krabi or Cage of Death?

1642
01:03:34,049 --> 01:03:35,819
If this is Krabi, that will be amazing.

1643
01:03:35,948 --> 01:03:37,279
It can't be.

1644
01:03:37,279 --> 01:03:39,848
(What will the last destination be?)

1645
01:03:39,948 --> 01:03:41,419
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1646
01:03:41,419 --> 01:03:43,658
(The decision has been made.)

1647
01:03:43,658 --> 01:03:44,658
Two...

1648
01:03:44,658 --> 01:03:46,129
(Exit 4)

1649
01:03:46,129 --> 01:03:47,129
Three.

1650
01:03:47,129 --> 01:03:54,468
(Is it paradise or the underworld?)

1651
01:03:59,709 --> 01:04:02,609
(Cage of Death)

1652
01:04:02,609 --> 01:04:04,209
- It's three, right? - Cage of Death.

1653
01:04:04,209 --> 01:04:05,408
- Which one was it? - Two?

1654
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:08,109
Krabi was Exit 1.

1655
01:04:09,948 --> 01:04:14,319
(Krabi was Exit 1.)

1656
01:04:15,589 --> 01:04:17,618
The final destination for Half and Half Tour...

1657
01:04:17,618 --> 01:04:20,058
is Australia's Cage of Death.

1658
01:04:20,428 --> 01:04:22,859
- Crocodiles like blood. - It'll be a pool of blood.

1659
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,959
- I can't believe this. - I don't want to go.

1660
01:04:24,959 --> 01:04:28,098
- It depends on whom Ji Hyo picks. - Right.

1661
01:04:28,098 --> 01:04:30,638
Today's winner is Ji Hyo.

1662
01:04:30,638 --> 01:04:33,709
(She's the 4th winner of the project.)

1663
01:04:33,709 --> 01:04:36,109
- Song Ji Hyo! - Song Ji Hyo!

1664
01:04:36,109 --> 01:04:37,609
- Song Ji Hyo! - Song Ji Hyo!

1665
01:04:37,609 --> 01:04:39,408
He's the designer.

1666
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:40,908
- Please trust him. - No.

1667
01:04:40,908 --> 01:04:42,549
Please take the designer.

1668
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:45,649
- How many can I buy? - You can buy four name tags.

1669
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:46,649
- Four? - That's...

1670
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:47,848
- a lot. - You have two each, right?

1671
01:04:47,848 --> 01:04:49,819
Please consider the designer.

1672
01:04:50,058 --> 01:04:53,558
Let me explain why Kwang Soo was the designer.

1673
01:04:53,729 --> 01:04:55,758
- He sent me a message. - What did he say?

1674
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:57,499
Hold on. You can talk after we finish filming.

1675
01:04:57,499 --> 01:04:58,828
No, we have to hear it. What is it?

1676
01:04:58,868 --> 01:05:01,769
He said he always gets picked,

1677
01:05:01,828 --> 01:05:04,939
so if he succeeds the secret mission, he wanted an exemption.

1678
01:05:04,939 --> 01:05:06,368
(This is the actual message he sent.)

1679
01:05:06,368 --> 01:05:07,439
That's what he said.

1680
01:05:07,868 --> 01:05:09,109
- He wanted to save himself. - I wanted an exemption.

1681
01:05:09,109 --> 01:05:11,479
- So you wanted to save yourself. - It was more like...

1682
01:05:11,479 --> 01:05:13,178
(He's flustered.)

1683
01:05:13,178 --> 01:05:14,578
(That's what it sounds like to us.)

1684
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:16,479
- That was well expressed. - Right?

1685
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:17,948
That was a good one.

1686
01:05:18,819 --> 01:05:21,788
He wanted to save himself only. He's right.

1687
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:23,788
It was more like...

1688
01:05:23,788 --> 01:05:25,288
Where is Kwang Soo's name?

1689
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:26,729
- Here. - I have two.

1690
01:05:26,729 --> 01:05:27,758
I see.

1691
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:29,499
He has two.

1692
01:05:29,499 --> 01:05:31,828
He's right next to Ji Hyo.

1693
01:05:31,959 --> 01:05:33,629
Ji Hyo is here.

1694
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:34,999
- Let's do two first. - Let's do that.

1695
01:05:34,999 --> 01:05:37,399
- Let's do it. - I'll do two first.

1696
01:05:37,399 --> 01:05:38,638
- Ji Hyo. - Come on.

1697
01:05:39,609 --> 01:05:41,769
- I tried my best. - Let's do it.

1698
01:05:41,808 --> 01:05:43,538
- I'll do 2. - There's a 50-percent chance.

1699
01:05:43,578 --> 01:05:45,379
- I'll cover my name first. - Of course.

1700
01:05:45,379 --> 01:05:47,149
Of course, you should do that.

1701
01:05:47,149 --> 01:05:49,178
You're going for me.

1702
01:05:49,549 --> 01:05:51,819
- Ji Hyo, Jong Kook's name... - What if...

1703
01:05:51,919 --> 01:05:54,749
we put all Jae Seok's name?

1704
01:05:54,749 --> 01:06:00,428
(What if we do Jae Seok for the 2 that's left?)

1705
01:06:00,428 --> 01:06:02,029
It's up to me, so I'll erase So Min's name.

1706
01:06:02,029 --> 01:06:03,529
- Thank you. - It's up to you.

1707
01:06:03,529 --> 01:06:06,499
- I have one. - She's scared of crocodiles.

1708
01:06:06,499 --> 01:06:08,198
- I'm scared of them too. - Who isn't?

1709
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:09,638
Who likes crocodiles?

1710
01:06:09,638 --> 01:06:11,738
I got bitten by one when I was young.

1711
01:06:11,738 --> 01:06:13,939
(Is he a pathological liar?)

1712
01:06:13,939 --> 01:06:15,008
The crocodile...

1713
01:06:15,008 --> 01:06:16,939
So Min is really scared.

1714
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:18,638
He did this...

1715
01:06:18,638 --> 01:06:20,408
- to pay back at us. - I'll spin it.

1716
01:06:20,408 --> 01:06:22,578
- This is for buying a name tag. - He's so mean.

1717
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:24,279
- Please spin it. - I agree.

1718
01:06:24,779 --> 01:06:25,819
Please.

1719
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:28,718
(Who will get their names put on?)

1720
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:30,218
No. It's Kwang Soo.

1721
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:32,529
It's Haha. It's Seok Jin.

1722
01:06:32,828 --> 01:06:33,928
Is it me? No way.

1723
01:06:34,788 --> 01:06:35,928
It's Se Chan.

1724
01:06:35,928 --> 01:06:36,959
(Se Chan gets picked.)

1725
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:38,899
Why do I get picked all day?

1726
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:40,629
Let's spin to pick whose name tag you'll cover.

1727
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:41,669
Let's do that.

1728
01:06:41,669 --> 01:06:43,098
- Okay. - You're spinning it again?

1729
01:06:43,098 --> 01:06:44,769
If it's me, you have to cover mine.

1730
01:06:44,769 --> 01:06:47,109
This is the Roulette Underworld.

1731
01:06:47,569 --> 01:06:48,708
- This is clean. - You're outstanding.

1732
01:06:48,708 --> 01:06:51,479
Please turn around before I spin.

1733
01:06:51,579 --> 01:06:54,609
I'll pick the person that the roulette lands on.

1734
01:06:54,609 --> 01:06:55,848
- Sure. - This is cruel.

1735
01:06:55,848 --> 01:06:56,918
(He's given up now.)

1736
01:06:56,918 --> 01:06:58,748
- I don't want to do this anymore. - I'll go.

1737
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:00,418
I think we spun the roulette like 30 times.

1738
01:07:00,949 --> 01:07:01,949
I spun it really hard.

1739
01:07:01,949 --> 01:07:03,289
Can we look?

1740
01:07:03,289 --> 01:07:06,558
- No, no yet. - I'd be on "Show Me the Money".

1741
01:07:07,229 --> 01:07:08,798
This is too intense for me.

1742
01:07:08,798 --> 01:07:10,229
We can look, right?

1743
01:07:11,029 --> 01:07:12,298
(Which lucky person will get their name erased?)

1744
01:07:12,298 --> 01:07:13,468
I'm worried.

1745
01:07:13,869 --> 01:07:14,869
Who is it?

1746
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:16,539
It's Haha.

1747
01:07:16,638 --> 01:07:18,168
- It's strange. - He's so lucky.

1748
01:07:18,168 --> 01:07:21,208
- He's really lucky. - This is incredible.

1749
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:22,779
- It's strange. - He's so lucky.

1750
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:24,579
- Seriously, Haha. - It's strange.

1751
01:07:24,579 --> 01:07:26,048
- Thank you. - We must accept it.

1752
01:07:26,048 --> 01:07:27,909
Attach it to Haha's name.

1753
01:07:27,909 --> 01:07:28,979
Is it attaching name tag?

1754
01:07:28,979 --> 01:07:30,048
Haha is so lucky.

1755
01:07:30,048 --> 01:07:31,979
- Goodness. - In Haha's case,

1756
01:07:32,019 --> 01:07:33,519
he kept winning.

1757
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:36,189
- It'd be fun to take him with us. - Really?

1758
01:07:36,189 --> 01:07:37,588
- Of course. - That's right.

1759
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:41,058
- Admit that it'll be fun. - Why would I go?

1760
01:07:41,058 --> 01:07:42,859
You didn't do anything wrong.

1761
01:07:42,998 --> 01:07:44,958
The last is...

1762
01:07:44,958 --> 01:07:47,128
Cage of Death in Australia.

1763
01:07:48,029 --> 01:07:51,199
(One slot for punishment is empty.)

1764
01:07:51,899 --> 01:07:54,239
- It's Cage of Death. - It's time to spin the roulette.

1765
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,779
This is very nerve-racking.

1766
01:07:56,579 --> 01:07:58,178
I'll spin it the opposite way.

1767
01:07:58,178 --> 01:08:00,348
- I'll spin it hard. - Push it really hard.

1768
01:08:00,479 --> 01:08:03,149
In 1, 2, 3.

1769
01:08:03,149 --> 01:08:04,718
(Who will be sent to the last destination?)

1770
01:08:04,718 --> 01:08:05,789
Goodness.

1771
01:08:05,789 --> 01:08:07,588
- I'm worried. - Four is many.

1772
01:08:07,588 --> 01:08:09,218
I might get selected...

1773
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:10,888
even though Kwang Soo has many name tags.

1774
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,758
- It passed my name. - No.

1775
01:08:13,758 --> 01:08:15,159
- It's not me. - It's Jong Kook.

1776
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:18,869
- No, it's Kwang Soo. - Okay.

1777
01:08:19,298 --> 01:08:20,428
Keep moving.

1778
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,838
(Will it be Kwang Soo?)

1779
01:08:24,838 --> 01:08:28,369
(Or will it be Jae Seok?)

1780
01:08:28,369 --> 01:08:34,208
(Who will be sent to Cage of Death?)

1781
01:08:34,678 --> 01:08:35,718
No.

1782
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:43,319
(Kwang Soo will be sent to Cage of Death.)

1783
01:08:45,928 --> 01:08:49,058
(Kwang Soo is selected, and Jae Seok survives.)

1784
01:08:51,829 --> 01:08:54,069
- I knew it. - Goodness.

1785
01:08:54,428 --> 01:08:55,498
That was perfect.

1786
01:08:55,939 --> 01:08:57,498
It was really perfect.

1787
01:08:57,498 --> 01:08:58,939
(He's relieved.)

1788
01:08:58,939 --> 01:09:00,409
Wasn't your name here?

1789
01:09:00,409 --> 01:09:02,239
- It was Ji Hyo. - Yes, it was my name.

1790
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:04,279
It was originally my name.

1791
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:06,208
I thought it'd be Jae Seok.

1792
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:09,579
(Why did he design Roulette Underworld?)

1793
01:09:10,449 --> 01:09:12,319
Something would be missing if Kwang Soo weren't selected.

1794
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,519
- That's right. - Kwang Soo is necessary.

1795
01:09:14,519 --> 01:09:16,388
Jae Seok, Jae Seok, So Min, and Kwang Soo.

1796
01:09:16,388 --> 01:09:17,659
My goodness.

1797
01:09:17,659 --> 01:09:19,229
It was originally my name.

1798
01:09:19,829 --> 01:09:21,529
Thank you, Designer Kwang.

1799
01:09:21,729 --> 01:09:23,529
- It's such a relief. - I know.

1800
01:09:23,529 --> 01:09:25,729
- My goodness. - All right.

1801
01:09:25,798 --> 01:09:27,729
- What did I do wrong? - Long live the designer.

1802
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:30,498
- Long live the designer. - Something feels strange.

1803
01:09:30,598 --> 01:09:34,308
Candidates for Half and Half Project have been determined.

1804
01:09:34,308 --> 01:09:36,239
Here are the four final destinations.

1805
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,279
It's recommended by Haha.

1806
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:40,979
Bora Bora in Polynesia...

1807
01:09:41,109 --> 01:09:42,848
is where So Min is selected to go.

1808
01:09:42,848 --> 01:09:47,189
(So Min will go to Bora Bora in Polynesia.)

1809
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:49,289
It's recommended by the staff.

1810
01:09:49,289 --> 01:09:51,958
Jae Seok will go to Nevis Swing in New Zealand.

1811
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:56,628
(Jae Seok will go to Nevis Swing in New Zealand.)

1812
01:09:56,928 --> 01:09:58,529
It's recommended by Seok Jin.

1813
01:09:58,529 --> 01:10:01,628
Jae Seok will go on a full tour in Rome, Italy.

1814
01:10:01,628 --> 01:10:04,298
(Jae Seok will go on a tour in Rome, Italy.)

1815
01:10:04,869 --> 01:10:05,968
Lastly,

1816
01:10:06,338 --> 01:10:08,979
Cage of Death in Australia is recommended by staff members.

1817
01:10:09,609 --> 01:10:11,609
It's where Kwang Soo will go.

1818
01:10:11,609 --> 01:10:15,819
(Kwang Soo will go to Cage of Death in Australia.)

1819
01:10:15,918 --> 01:10:18,019
Whenever we do this,

1820
01:10:18,019 --> 01:10:20,319
certain members always get selected.

1821
01:10:21,048 --> 01:10:23,819
- That's right. - There are a few.

1822
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:25,388
- He's a new member. - Whatever we do,

1823
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:26,928
it's always the same members.

1824
01:10:27,088 --> 01:10:28,159
Let me warn you.

1825
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:30,098
I hope Nevis Swing won't get selected.

1826
01:10:30,098 --> 01:10:31,829
- What if it does? - However, I'll take...

1827
01:10:31,928 --> 01:10:32,998
one of you with me.

1828
01:10:33,098 --> 01:10:34,598
- One of us? - Yes.

1829
01:10:35,838 --> 01:10:38,638
- We're in trouble. - Ever since we started the project,

1830
01:10:38,638 --> 01:10:41,409
- I had someone in mind. - Really?

1831
01:10:41,638 --> 01:10:42,838
However,

1832
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:45,138
his name tag started taking over the roulette.

1833
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:48,348
It's my personal opinion.

1834
01:10:48,348 --> 01:10:49,619
- It was at first. - Right.

1835
01:10:49,619 --> 01:10:51,519
- That was my thought at first. - I understand.

1836
01:10:51,548 --> 01:10:53,248
The probability is 25 percent.

1837
01:10:53,248 --> 01:10:54,918
- Let's spin it. - Turn it clockwise.

1838
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:55,989
Like this?

1839
01:10:55,989 --> 01:10:57,789
- Here we go. - It'll determine who.

1840
01:10:57,789 --> 01:10:59,859
- Don't push softly. - Don't.

1841
01:10:59,859 --> 01:11:01,558
- It's the last chance. - Right.

1842
01:11:01,558 --> 01:11:04,798
- We can't change the result. - Here we go.

1843
01:11:04,798 --> 01:11:07,069
2 destinations are good, and the other 2 are bad.

1844
01:11:07,069 --> 01:11:08,498
It's half and half.

1845
01:11:08,498 --> 01:11:11,899
(2 destinations are paradise, and the other 2 are dreadful.)

1846
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:16,508
(Each has a 50-percent chance.)

1847
01:11:17,308 --> 01:11:20,808
(Who will go where?)

1848
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:23,218
- Let's go. - I hope it won't be me.

1849
01:11:23,218 --> 01:11:26,248
- In 1, 2, 3. - Please.

1850
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:29,458
(The roulette is turned for the final time.)

1851
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:31,189
- Here it is. - It's the last chance.

1852
01:11:31,189 --> 01:11:32,829
- Please. - I'm serious.

1853
01:11:32,829 --> 01:11:34,258
- Anything but Nevis Swing. - We get one chance.

1854
01:11:34,258 --> 01:11:36,128
(The selected member must go.)

1855
01:11:36,128 --> 01:11:37,329
This is nerve-racking.

1856
01:11:37,628 --> 01:11:40,428
- It's Kwang Soo. - Let it be Kwang Soo.

1857
01:11:40,428 --> 01:11:41,998
It's Jae Seok.

1858
01:11:41,998 --> 01:11:44,598
- It's Kwang Soo. - It's Jae Seok.

1859
01:11:44,598 --> 01:11:46,909
- It's Kwang Soo. - Let it be Kwang Soo.

1860
01:11:46,909 --> 01:11:48,609
It's Jae Seok.

1861
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:50,838
It's Kwang Soo.

1862
01:11:50,838 --> 01:11:52,409
- No. - It's Kwang Soo.

1863
01:11:55,819 --> 01:11:59,348
(If Kwang Soo is selected, he goes to a cage full of crocodiles.)

1864
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:02,859
(If So Min is selected, she goes to Bora Bora.)

1865
01:12:04,489 --> 01:12:08,998
(What will be the result of the final spin?)

1866
01:12:12,199 --> 01:12:15,569
(Kwang Soo is selected.)

1867
01:12:16,739 --> 01:12:20,008
(Kwang Soo gets penalized as always.)

1868
01:12:20,008 --> 01:12:21,208
Let's get it.

1869
01:12:21,369 --> 01:12:22,739
Let's get it.

1870
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:25,779
(Kwang Soo gets penalized as always.)

1871
01:12:25,779 --> 01:12:27,248
Let's get it.

1872
01:12:27,248 --> 01:12:28,649
(Kwang Soo gets the final penalty.)

1873
01:12:28,649 --> 01:12:30,579
This is incredible.

1874
01:12:31,019 --> 01:12:32,489
- I knew it. - See?

1875
01:12:32,489 --> 01:12:33,619
It's Kwang Soo.

1876
01:12:35,088 --> 01:12:37,359
- Goodness. - Jae Seok was the most excited.

1877
01:12:37,758 --> 01:12:39,789
- I don't know why. - Goodness.

1878
01:12:40,729 --> 01:12:42,359
Jae Seok has to go anyway.

1879
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:43,399
That's right.

1880
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:44,798
You got lucky.

1881
01:12:45,159 --> 01:12:46,769
- It's better than Nevis Swing. - We don't know...

1882
01:12:46,769 --> 01:12:48,329
- whom Kwang Soo will choose. - Right.

1883
01:12:48,329 --> 01:12:50,298
(We don't know whom Kwang Soo will choose.)

1884
01:12:54,569 --> 01:12:56,378
- Let's see. - The member is selected.

1885
01:12:56,638 --> 01:12:57,808
The result is...

1886
01:12:58,079 --> 01:12:59,378
No one is talking.

1887
01:12:59,378 --> 01:13:00,949
Wait a minute.

1888
01:13:00,949 --> 01:13:03,319
Everyone is avoiding eye contact with me.

1889
01:13:03,319 --> 01:13:05,218
I can't look at Kwang Soo.

1890
01:13:05,218 --> 01:13:07,619
- We're not avoiding. - Seriously.

1891
01:13:08,519 --> 01:13:09,989
For Half and Half Tour,

1892
01:13:09,989 --> 01:13:11,989
the final destination and member...

1893
01:13:12,729 --> 01:13:15,428
- are Cage of Death in Australia... - Who is his plus-one?

1894
01:13:15,428 --> 01:13:17,298
with Kwang Soo.

1895
01:13:17,298 --> 01:13:19,569
It's Cage of Death.

1896
01:13:19,569 --> 01:13:20,569
(Moving)

1897
01:13:20,569 --> 01:13:22,939
Wait a minute. Why did you switch places with me?

1898
01:13:22,939 --> 01:13:24,869
He must decide with whom he'll travel.

1899
01:13:24,869 --> 01:13:29,479
- I have no idea. - Why not?

1900
01:13:29,479 --> 01:13:32,678
- Will you choose now? - Does he get a choice?

1901
01:13:32,678 --> 01:13:33,779
(Kwang Soo will choose his plus-one.)

1902
01:13:33,779 --> 01:13:35,748
Or will you choose next week?

1903
01:13:36,519 --> 01:13:38,479
(Whom will Kwang Soo choose?)

1904
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:40,548
It's a good idea to take some time.

1905
01:13:40,619 --> 01:13:44,088
He'll choose Jae Seok next week.

1906
01:13:44,088 --> 01:13:47,689
I haven't decided yet.

1907
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:48,859
- Why not? - Really?

1908
01:13:48,859 --> 01:13:51,098
- You haven't decided? - Is it 9 against 1?

1909
01:13:51,229 --> 01:13:53,769
Many people stressed me out today.

1910
01:13:55,638 --> 01:13:57,138
They gave me a hard time.

1911
01:13:58,769 --> 01:14:00,539
I was slapped...

1912
01:14:00,638 --> 01:14:02,508
about eight times today.

1913
01:14:02,508 --> 01:14:04,579
(There are many whom he wants to take.)

1914
01:14:04,579 --> 01:14:06,348
There are so many.

1915
01:14:06,449 --> 01:14:08,279
Someone added my name twice.

1916
01:14:08,708 --> 01:14:12,588
Someone wished me bad luck at first.

1917
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:15,319
- As soon as we started, right? - Right.

1918
01:14:15,418 --> 01:14:17,689
- Haha was terrible. - Seok Jin was mean too.

1919
01:14:17,689 --> 01:14:20,029
- Jae Seok as well. - Seok Jin was mean.

1920
01:14:20,029 --> 01:14:21,829
Seok Jin is always on my mind.

1921
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:26,128
- That's not what he means. - What?

1922
01:14:26,298 --> 01:14:28,128
Seok Jin is always on his mind.

1923
01:14:28,298 --> 01:14:30,468
Is that how you interpret that?

1924
01:14:30,498 --> 01:14:33,838
Thank you, Kwang Soo. I understand.

1925
01:14:34,439 --> 01:14:36,909
Please say a few words, and we'll finish here.

1926
01:14:36,909 --> 01:14:38,909
- I'm jealous of you. - Let's hurry.

1927
01:14:38,909 --> 01:14:43,248
- The shoot is getting long. - Australia sounds nice.

1928
01:14:43,248 --> 01:14:45,119
You won't be jet-lagged there.

1929
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,519
Let's hurry and go home.

1930
01:14:46,888 --> 01:14:48,248
- Did you say hurry up? - Yes.

1931
01:14:48,449 --> 01:14:50,489
Do you want to pick me? Go ahead.

1932
01:14:50,958 --> 01:14:53,229
- Choose him. - Go ahead.

1933
01:14:53,229 --> 01:14:54,758
- Pick Jong Kook. - Go ahead.

1934
01:14:54,758 --> 01:14:56,058
Pick me.

1935
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:59,468
- You can choose me. I'm fine. - We'll switch places.

1936
01:14:59,468 --> 01:15:00,869
Pick him.

1937
01:15:00,869 --> 01:15:03,399
Let's have a good time in Australia.

1938
01:15:04,539 --> 01:15:05,638
Is that another penalty?

1939
01:15:05,638 --> 01:15:08,939
Let me think it over for one week.

1940
01:15:09,579 --> 01:15:10,838
Just one week.

1941
01:15:10,838 --> 01:15:12,949
I'll hold myself back today.

1942
01:15:12,949 --> 01:15:14,378
- Listen. - I'll hold myself back.

1943
01:15:14,378 --> 01:15:15,979
Let's hurry up.

1944
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:18,149
(Do you remember 2 months ago?)

1945
01:15:18,149 --> 01:15:22,218
(So Min was selected for the final penalty during I Go Race.)

1946
01:15:22,218 --> 01:15:23,519
(Her destination is...)

1947
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,218
(Indonesia's manual, wooden cable car.)

1948
01:15:25,418 --> 01:15:28,229
(Unfortunately, Kwang Soo is selected as her partner.)

1949
01:15:28,229 --> 01:15:30,998
(They finally go to Indonesia.)

1950
01:15:30,998 --> 01:15:34,069
(They're welcomed by many fans upon arrival.)

1951
01:15:34,069 --> 01:15:36,939
(However, the penalty wasn't forgiving.)

1952
01:15:36,939 --> 01:15:38,199
(Despite the terrible weather,)

1953
01:15:38,199 --> 01:15:40,739
(Kwang Soo and So Min get on the cable car.)

1954
01:15:40,739 --> 01:15:43,008
(The force of nature is uncontrollable.)

1955
01:15:43,008 --> 01:15:45,239
(The two members get penalized.)

1956
01:15:45,239 --> 01:15:48,048
(Their long journey starts now.)

1957
01:15:49,248 --> 01:15:51,178
I want to go back to Korea!

1958
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:58,418
(Incheon International Airport on September 3 at 8am)

1959
01:15:58,418 --> 01:16:02,058
(A somber, black vehicle arrives.)

1960
01:16:06,598 --> 01:16:10,039
(Laughing)

1961
01:16:12,308 --> 01:16:13,369
Hello.

1962
01:16:15,109 --> 01:16:17,079
- Here's your microphone. - Okay.

1963
01:16:18,279 --> 01:16:21,579
Gosh, I can't believe it.

1964
01:16:24,048 --> 01:16:25,279
This is fun.

1965
01:16:25,279 --> 01:16:26,748
(He clenches his teeth.)

1966
01:16:28,088 --> 01:16:30,289
(He can't believe it the more he thinks about it.)

1967
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:32,428
Am I dreaming?

1968
01:16:35,128 --> 01:16:37,258
The time and atmosphere...

1969
01:16:37,258 --> 01:16:39,869
(The time and atmosphere seem dreamy.)

1970
01:16:39,869 --> 01:16:41,199
What did I do wrong?

1971
01:16:41,869 --> 01:16:44,638
What did I do to deserve this?

1972
01:16:44,638 --> 01:16:45,939
(I haven't done anything wrong.)

1973
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:48,409
It feels like a dream. What's going on?

1974
01:16:50,308 --> 01:16:52,579
You're going to Indonesia today...

1975
01:16:52,579 --> 01:16:54,649
in case you thought it was Australia.

1976
01:16:55,649 --> 01:16:57,248
(Goodness)

1977
01:16:58,519 --> 01:17:00,048
Why would I be mistaken?

1978
01:17:02,019 --> 01:17:03,789
We also have to go to Australia.

1979
01:17:03,789 --> 01:17:05,189
What's wrong with you?

1980
01:17:05,628 --> 01:17:07,928
I haven't done anything wrong.

1981
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,329
How many places do I have to go?

1982
01:17:11,829 --> 01:17:13,899
My schedule next month is full of penalties.

1983
01:17:13,899 --> 01:17:14,968
(The same goes for his cameraman.)

1984
01:17:15,369 --> 01:17:17,668
(Another vehicle arrives.)

1985
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:21,468
Hello.

1986
01:17:21,468 --> 01:17:22,638
(So Min arrives.)

1987
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:25,079
Hi, So Min.

1988
01:17:25,409 --> 01:17:27,848
(She doesn't hear him.)

1989
01:17:28,848 --> 01:17:30,218
She must be in a terrible mood.

1990
01:17:30,218 --> 01:17:31,548
(He tries his best to stay calm.)

1991
01:17:31,548 --> 01:17:32,689
She is closing the door.

1992
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:33,918
Hey.

1993
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:36,758
For goodness' sake.

1994
01:17:36,758 --> 01:17:38,019
So Min closed the door.

1995
01:17:38,289 --> 01:17:40,529
All right. Thank you.

1996
01:17:40,529 --> 01:17:41,829
(She unloads the luggage as if nothing happened.)

1997
01:17:42,029 --> 01:17:43,298
Hello.

1998
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:46,269
Ouch. Thank you.

1999
01:17:47,998 --> 01:17:49,439
Hello.

2000
01:17:50,168 --> 01:17:51,899
- Hello. - Why do you have so much luggage?

2001
01:17:53,138 --> 01:17:54,269
One is for clothes.

2002
01:17:55,409 --> 01:17:56,439
Did you fit everything in one suitcase?

2003
01:17:56,439 --> 01:17:58,178
Yes, my suitcase is very heavy. Try lifting it.

2004
01:17:58,979 --> 01:18:00,308
- What's inside? - Clothes.

2005
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:02,479
- You only brought one suitcase. - Yes.

2006
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:04,878
Why do you have so much? Will you have a fashion show?

2007
01:18:05,019 --> 01:18:06,449
I won't have a fashion show.

2008
01:18:07,149 --> 01:18:09,659
I brought clothes and personal belongings.

2009
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:11,789
I see that you don't have much experience with penalties.

2010
01:18:12,829 --> 01:18:15,029
That's understandable. I was like that at one time.

2011
01:18:15,029 --> 01:18:16,659
What do I need?

2012
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:18,329
- There are many things you need. - Don't you only need clothes?

2013
01:18:18,558 --> 01:18:20,769
To be honest, I can't open my eyes.

2014
01:18:21,168 --> 01:18:24,298
Kwang Soo and I talked on the phone at 4am.

2015
01:18:24,369 --> 01:18:25,968
- Both of us stayed up. - I couldn't sleep.

2016
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:28,138
I couldn't sleep.

2017
01:18:28,439 --> 01:18:29,939
I still can't believe this is happening.

2018
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:31,779
Am I going? Am I really going?

2019
01:18:32,149 --> 01:18:34,678
Not even the worst criminal would receive such punishment.

2020
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,649
Kwang Soo and So Min, you will go on a penalty tour...

2021
01:18:38,649 --> 01:18:41,619
for People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent.

2022
01:18:41,949 --> 01:18:45,588
You will go on Indonesia's manual, wooden cable car.

2023
01:18:45,958 --> 01:18:53,029
(They must go on a cable car that is made with wood and ropes.)

2024
01:18:53,029 --> 01:18:57,798
(Depending on the power of men makes you fear the nature.)

2025
01:18:59,308 --> 01:19:01,609
Why must I go with someone?

2026
01:19:02,109 --> 01:19:04,708
- What do you mean by that? - Why must I go with Kwang Soo?

2027
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:06,479
- What are you talking about? - Look.

2028
01:19:06,479 --> 01:19:07,779
(Suddenly)

2029
01:19:07,779 --> 01:19:08,979
Do you remember this?

2030
01:19:09,718 --> 01:19:12,189
(The bracelet looks familiar.)

2031
01:19:12,189 --> 01:19:15,119
(3 months ago, on their way to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear)

2032
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:18,928
(A cute bracelet caught So Min's attention.)

2033
01:19:18,928 --> 01:19:22,529
(Kwang Soo, please buy it for me.)

2034
01:19:22,529 --> 01:19:25,399
(Don't speak nonsense.)

2035
01:19:25,968 --> 01:19:28,128
(I guess I won't buy it.)

2036
01:19:28,128 --> 01:19:31,798
(So Min couldn't buy the bracelet since she didn't have enough money.)

2037
01:19:32,338 --> 01:19:33,508
(Handing over)

2038
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:35,308
- Is it a present? - Kwang Soo.

2039
01:19:36,779 --> 01:19:38,779
(So Min was touched, and Kwang Soo was embarrassed.)

2040
01:19:38,779 --> 01:19:41,808
(Kwang Soo was cold outside but warm inside.)

2041
01:19:42,149 --> 01:19:46,519
(He acted like a big brother with a 10-dollar bracelet.)

2042
01:19:46,519 --> 01:19:49,159
- That's right. - I wore it. You remember, right?

2043
01:19:50,718 --> 01:19:52,088
You still have it.

2044
01:19:52,088 --> 01:19:54,029
Of course, I do. I wore it often during the summer.

2045
01:19:54,388 --> 01:19:55,458
Isn't it pretty?

2046
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:56,558
It looks good.

2047
01:19:56,558 --> 01:19:57,699
(It looks good on your wrist.)

2048
01:19:57,699 --> 01:19:58,998
Remember these moments.

2049
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:00,699
We prepared a special tour...

2050
01:20:00,699 --> 01:20:04,468
for the moths of Running Man, Kwang Soo and So Min.

2051
01:20:04,998 --> 01:20:07,069
It's called Indonesia's Tiger Moth Tour.

2052
01:20:08,909 --> 01:20:11,039
It's called Indonesia's Tiger Moth Tour.

2053
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:12,409
Tiger Moth Tour?

2054
01:20:12,878 --> 01:20:14,579
What kind of a name is that?

2055
01:20:14,878 --> 01:20:18,178
I have a question. Aren't we only receiving a penalty?

2056
01:20:18,178 --> 01:20:19,348
No, you aren't.

2057
01:20:19,418 --> 01:20:21,218
- Is there more? - It's Tiger Moth Tour.

2058
01:20:21,789 --> 01:20:23,119
- Just us two? - Yes.

2059
01:20:23,258 --> 01:20:24,718
For this tour,

2060
01:20:24,718 --> 01:20:26,829
the travel expenses are important.

2061
01:20:28,229 --> 01:20:30,029
Isn't this the main shoot for Running Man?

2062
01:20:30,598 --> 01:20:33,829
Where is everyone? Why are we by ourselves?

2063
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:35,968
One of us will receive a penalty,

2064
01:20:35,968 --> 01:20:37,369
- right? - Is there another penalty?

2065
01:20:37,369 --> 01:20:38,468
(What are you talking about?)

2066
01:20:38,468 --> 01:20:39,638
Listen.

2067
01:20:39,638 --> 01:20:42,008
- You will... - Why are you attacking me?

2068
01:20:42,378 --> 01:20:44,579
I am here thanks to you.

2069
01:20:44,579 --> 01:20:46,848
I am grabbing you by the collar in Jae Seok's place.

2070
01:20:48,248 --> 01:20:50,348
What is this?

2071
01:20:50,848 --> 01:20:52,119
I don't know what is going on.

2072
01:20:52,748 --> 01:20:54,848
The travel expenses are expensive.

2073
01:20:54,848 --> 01:20:58,088
You can't use the money you brought with you.

2074
01:20:58,489 --> 01:21:01,489
For the two of you who are going on a penalty tour,

2075
01:21:01,659 --> 01:21:04,598
the six members sent you allowances.

2076
01:21:05,159 --> 01:21:06,168
That's incredible.

2077
01:21:06,869 --> 01:21:08,329
They are amazing.

2078
01:21:08,329 --> 01:21:10,239
For the three days of Tiger Moth Tour,

2079
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:12,609
you can only use the allowances from the members.

2080
01:21:12,838 --> 01:21:16,378
The person who has more money upon arriving in Korea...

2081
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:18,678
will receive an advantage during the next race.

2082
01:21:18,678 --> 01:21:20,909
- An advantage? - There is an advantage.

2083
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:22,819
- Of course, there is an advantage. - Excuse me.

2084
01:21:22,819 --> 01:21:25,218
Is the next race similar to this one?

2085
01:21:25,418 --> 01:21:27,189
- All projects are over. - There will be another one.

2086
01:21:27,189 --> 01:21:28,958
- Will there be another one? - There will be another project.

2087
01:21:28,958 --> 01:21:30,619
Will we have more things like I Go Stickers?

2088
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:32,289
You should tell us in advance.

2089
01:21:32,289 --> 01:21:33,888
Will there be more word plays?

2090
01:21:34,558 --> 01:21:37,058
If that's the case, I need to clear my schedule in advance.

2091
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:39,399
Be quiet.

2092
01:21:39,498 --> 01:21:41,998
Stop it. Stop it.

2093
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:44,269
You will now have a mission for the travel expenses...

2094
01:21:44,269 --> 01:21:46,668
called Money Sixth Sense.

2095
01:21:47,239 --> 01:21:49,838
Inside the six envelopes are allowances...

2096
01:21:50,109 --> 01:21:52,178
- ranging from zero... - Is there one with zero amount of money?

2097
01:21:52,308 --> 01:21:54,409
to 200 dollars.

2098
01:21:56,418 --> 01:21:58,348
Each one of you will choose three envelopes.

2099
01:21:58,418 --> 01:22:02,218
The amount of money inside them is your travel expense.

2100
01:22:02,218 --> 01:22:03,458
Aren't we a team?

2101
01:22:03,458 --> 01:22:06,159
- He and I should be friends. - Is this a competition?

2102
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:07,689
(His eyes change.)

2103
01:22:07,789 --> 01:22:08,899
Must I compete against him again?

2104
01:22:08,899 --> 01:22:10,159
- The travel expenses... - Will one of us ride the cable car?

2105
01:22:10,229 --> 01:22:12,468
- are very important. - Will one of us ride the cable car?

2106
01:22:12,699 --> 01:22:15,098
It will be decided by the travel expenses.

2107
01:22:15,798 --> 01:22:17,298
Don't touch them.

2108
01:22:17,298 --> 01:22:19,409
It will be decided by the travel expenses.

2109
01:22:19,609 --> 01:22:21,609
(This is a competition.)

2110
01:22:21,609 --> 01:22:24,109
- I chose the envelopes. - No, this is ridiculous.

2111
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:26,748
(Don't touch them.)

2112
01:22:26,748 --> 01:22:28,378
No, this is ridiculous.

2113
01:22:28,378 --> 01:22:31,048
- Hurry up, and give them to me. - Ji Hyo, Jae Seok, and Jong Kook.

2114
01:22:31,048 --> 01:22:32,418
The decision is final if you touch the envelopes.

2115
01:22:32,418 --> 01:22:34,819
- The decision is final. - Don't be ridiculous.

2116
01:22:34,819 --> 01:22:36,159
I am sorry.

2117
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:38,119
- The decision is final. - Give them to me.

2118
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:39,789
I am sorry. The decision is final.

2119
01:22:39,789 --> 01:22:41,829
You don't know how much money is inside.

2120
01:22:41,829 --> 01:22:44,258
- This is ridiculous. - I am sorry.

2121
01:22:44,458 --> 01:22:45,468
(Hitting)

2122
01:22:45,468 --> 01:22:47,529
That's not my stomach. What are you doing?

2123
01:22:47,699 --> 01:22:48,798
Are you out of your mind?

2124
01:22:49,638 --> 01:22:50,798
What is wrong with you?

2125
01:22:50,838 --> 01:22:52,269
My legs are long. Be careful.

2126
01:22:52,739 --> 01:22:54,769
(I can't spend 3 days with someone like him.)

2127
01:22:54,769 --> 01:22:55,878
What is wrong with you?

2128
01:22:55,878 --> 01:22:58,878
This is wrong. You can't do this to me.

2129
01:22:58,878 --> 01:23:00,378
Your envelopes might have more money.

2130
01:23:00,378 --> 01:23:01,479
No, they won't.

2131
01:23:01,479 --> 01:23:04,319
I know they won't. There is Seok Jin's envelope.

2132
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:07,588
- There is nothing I can do. - Give me Ji Hyo's or Jong Kook's.

2133
01:23:07,588 --> 01:23:09,359
You must do that much.

2134
01:23:09,989 --> 01:23:13,689
(Which one should I give her?)

2135
01:23:13,689 --> 01:23:17,229
(What is Kwang Soo's choice?)

2136
01:23:17,229 --> 01:23:20,628
(He gives her Ji Hyo's envelope...)

2137
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:23,598
(and receives Seok Jin's envelope.)

2138
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:25,468
(Kwang Soo gets envelopes from Jae Seok, Jong Kook, and Seok Jin.)

2139
01:23:25,468 --> 01:23:27,308
(So Min gets envelopes from Haha, Ji Hyo, and Se Chan.)

2140
01:23:27,409 --> 01:23:29,279
Please reveal the amount.

2141
01:23:29,609 --> 01:23:30,739
Do we reveal the amount?

2142
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:32,178
It doesn't matter.

2143
01:23:33,079 --> 01:23:34,878
It's a gift card for meat.

2144
01:23:35,008 --> 01:23:36,319
Haha is cool.

2145
01:23:36,548 --> 01:23:37,779
- It's from Haha, right? - It's not money.

2146
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:39,588
(Wait a minute. It's not money.)

2147
01:23:39,588 --> 01:23:41,119
It's a gift card I can only use at a restaurant.

2148
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:42,489
You can only use it at a restaurant.

2149
01:23:42,489 --> 01:23:43,819
(You can only use it at a restaurant in Hongdae.)

2150
01:23:43,989 --> 01:23:45,489
Is he picking a fight?

2151
01:23:46,258 --> 01:23:49,458
We asked him how much he would give if he were to give an allowance.

2152
01:23:49,729 --> 01:23:51,399
This was his answer.

2153
01:23:51,399 --> 01:23:53,229
- This is a competition, right? - Yes, it is.

2154
01:23:53,229 --> 01:23:54,569
The more money you have, the better it is.

2155
01:23:54,569 --> 01:23:55,968
- That's right. - This is...

2156
01:23:56,939 --> 01:23:59,138
- You can eat meat later. - My throat feels tight.

2157
01:24:00,909 --> 01:24:03,939
- I can't use it in Indonesia. - Of course not.

2158
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:05,808
You can only use it at Hongdae.

2159
01:24:07,348 --> 01:24:10,319
(She checks the allowance from Ji Hyo.)

2160
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:11,548
- Whose is it? - There is a lot of money.

2161
01:24:11,619 --> 01:24:13,289
My goodness, Ji Hyo.

2162
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:15,388
There is a lot of money. She is the best.

2163
01:24:15,519 --> 01:24:17,519
She is cool.

2164
01:24:18,218 --> 01:24:20,329
50 dollars. Ji Hyo gave 50 dollars.

2165
01:24:20,329 --> 01:24:21,958
You should give me 20 dollars.

2166
01:24:21,958 --> 01:24:24,458
Don't be ridiculous. I bet Jong Kook gave 50 dollars.

2167
01:24:24,458 --> 01:24:25,899
Ji Hyo wanted you to remain confident abroad.

2168
01:24:25,899 --> 01:24:28,668
(I don't want them to be discouraged abroad.)

2169
01:24:29,098 --> 01:24:31,899
(She checks the allowance from Se Chan.)

2170
01:24:31,899 --> 01:24:33,468
What is this?

2171
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:34,569
(My goodness.)

2172
01:24:35,739 --> 01:24:36,808
Which one is real money?

2173
01:24:37,579 --> 01:24:40,508
(Se Chan gave 200 dollars in game money.)

2174
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:42,319
- Real money is real money. - What?

2175
01:24:42,348 --> 01:24:43,779
- Real money is real money. - This one doesn't count.

2176
01:24:44,519 --> 01:24:46,149
What is this?

2177
01:24:46,149 --> 01:24:47,348
(I am disappointed in Se Chan.)

2178
01:24:47,348 --> 01:24:49,588
Se Chan said that he will give 200 dollars...

2179
01:24:49,588 --> 01:24:51,588
in game money.

2180
01:24:51,588 --> 01:24:52,729
(Se Chan, how dare you?)

2181
01:24:52,729 --> 01:24:53,859
Yang Se Chan...

2182
01:24:54,689 --> 01:24:56,359
I will check Seok Jin's envelope.

2183
01:24:56,359 --> 01:24:57,359
You never know what Seok Jin will do.

2184
01:24:57,359 --> 01:24:58,798
He is a big spender.

2185
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:02,668
- Seok Jin. - There is a lot of money.

2186
01:25:02,998 --> 01:25:04,098
There is a lot of money.

2187
01:25:04,098 --> 01:25:05,298
(It's a surprising 50 dollars.)

2188
01:25:05,298 --> 01:25:06,668
- Did he give 100 dollars? - 50 dollars.

2189
01:25:06,668 --> 01:25:07,708
That's the same amount as mine.

2190
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:10,838
What about Jong Kook? You are so mean.

2191
01:25:10,838 --> 01:25:12,808
How could you let him keep the envelopes of his choice?

2192
01:25:15,579 --> 01:25:16,979
What a jerk!

2193
01:25:16,979 --> 01:25:19,149
(What a jerk!)

2194
01:25:19,588 --> 01:25:20,649
Whose is it?

2195
01:25:20,649 --> 01:25:22,159
Jong Kook's envelope is empty.

2196
01:25:22,789 --> 01:25:24,558
- He has issues. - Is it empty?

2197
01:25:24,588 --> 01:25:26,189
- It's empty. There is nothing. - Is it really empty?

2198
01:25:26,189 --> 01:25:27,729
- It's empty, right? - He said he won't give any money.

2199
01:25:28,829 --> 01:25:30,498
Thank goodness. How much did Jae Seok give?

2200
01:25:30,498 --> 01:25:31,829
(He feels betrayed.)

2201
01:25:31,829 --> 01:25:33,598
I got goosebumps from seeing the empty envelope.

2202
01:25:34,199 --> 01:25:35,298
- The last one is from Jae Seok. - Let's see.

2203
01:25:35,298 --> 01:25:38,098
- Jae Seok doesn't joke around. - No, he doesn't.

2204
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:43,208
(There are 50 dollars inside the envelope.)

2205
01:25:44,079 --> 01:25:45,848
Give me 10 dollars.

2206
01:25:46,348 --> 01:25:47,949
You didn't pay back my four dollars.

2207
01:25:47,949 --> 01:25:49,918
Pay back with real money.

2208
01:25:49,949 --> 01:25:51,319
I have real money.

2209
01:25:51,319 --> 01:25:52,348
- Come on. - It's in my suitcase.

2210
01:25:52,348 --> 01:25:53,588
Give me four dollars.

2211
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:55,558
Pay me back right now.

2212
01:25:55,558 --> 01:25:57,888
- You need to pay me back. - Wait a minute.

2213
01:25:57,989 --> 01:26:00,529
- She is like a moneylender. - Of course, I am.

2214
01:26:00,529 --> 01:26:01,689
I borrowed game money,

2215
01:26:02,088 --> 01:26:04,298
but she wants me to pay back with real money.

2216
01:26:04,329 --> 01:26:06,229
Do you think it makes sense?

2217
01:26:06,369 --> 01:26:07,729
Is this Blue Marble?

2218
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:08,899
(Is game money real money?)

2219
01:26:08,899 --> 01:26:09,998
Give me 10 dollars.

2220
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:11,168
- You really want that much. - Yes.

2221
01:26:12,069 --> 01:26:14,239
Your credit has been restored.

2222
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:16,909
I will lend you more money. Ask me if you need money.

2223
01:26:16,909 --> 01:26:18,308
I have money.

2224
01:26:18,609 --> 01:26:20,308
Thank you.

2225
01:26:20,449 --> 01:26:22,149
- Take six dollars. - Thank you.

2226
01:26:22,949 --> 01:26:25,848
We will now leave for Indonesia.

2227
01:26:26,119 --> 01:26:28,588
(This is fun.)

2228
01:26:28,588 --> 01:26:29,789
This is fun. Smile.

2229
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:31,519
- Shall we jump and teleport? - Let's do it.

2230
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:32,958
- Never mind. - Let's do it this once.

2231
01:26:32,958 --> 01:26:34,088
- Shall we jump? - Yes.

2232
01:26:34,388 --> 01:26:35,598
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

2233
01:26:35,729 --> 01:26:37,899
(Let's jump.)

2234
01:26:37,899 --> 01:26:40,199
(Sighing)

2235
01:26:40,199 --> 01:26:43,498
(Indonesia's Tiger Moth Tour begins.)

2236
01:26:43,769 --> 01:26:45,168
We are really going.

2237
01:26:46,308 --> 01:26:48,609
(My goodness.)

2238
01:26:48,609 --> 01:26:50,208
I can't believe this is happening.

2239
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:53,348
Am I going to Indonesia or Australia?

2240
01:26:55,519 --> 01:26:56,878
There are so many people.

2241
01:26:57,378 --> 01:26:59,949
They must be going to Indonesia to receive a penalty.

2242
01:27:00,019 --> 01:27:02,359
What are you talking about? Come to your senses.

2243
01:27:02,758 --> 01:27:04,019
You should wash your face in the airplane.

2244
01:27:04,019 --> 01:27:05,058
(They are tired.)

2245
01:27:05,058 --> 01:27:06,888
(They are each other's penalty.)

2246
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:10,598
(The 10-hour flight begins.)

2247
01:27:11,699 --> 01:27:14,168
(They take a 7-hour flight to Jakarta...)

2248
01:27:14,168 --> 01:27:16,468
(and an hour and 20 minutes flight to Yogyakarta.)

2249
01:27:16,668 --> 01:27:19,909
(September 3, 10pm, Adisutjipto International Airport)

2250
01:27:20,138 --> 01:27:22,878
(A cheerful country with various kinds of people)

2251
01:27:22,878 --> 01:27:24,539
(A cheerful country with various kinds of people)

2252
01:27:24,539 --> 01:27:27,449
(Indonesia has its unique taste and color.)

2253
01:27:27,449 --> 01:27:29,819
(What's this noise at the airport?)

2254
01:27:30,718 --> 01:27:34,649
(People are gathered to see him.)

2255
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:37,159
(They welcome the Asian Prince.)

2256
01:27:39,989 --> 01:27:42,159
(Hello)

2257
01:27:43,159 --> 01:27:46,668
(They're excited to see Kwang Soo.)

2258
01:27:46,668 --> 01:27:48,199
(That's right.)

2259
01:27:48,199 --> 01:27:50,968
(Kwang Soo is the Prince of Asia.)

2260
01:27:51,769 --> 01:27:54,838
(He becomes all nice and friendly.)

2261
01:27:56,609 --> 01:27:58,739
(He's always teased by the members,)

2262
01:27:58,739 --> 01:28:01,449
(but in fact, he's popular all around the world.)

2263
01:28:01,449 --> 01:28:04,548
(They welcome the betrayer couple.)

2264
01:28:04,878 --> 01:28:06,888
It was true after all.

2265
01:28:06,888 --> 01:28:09,019
(It's shocking for So Min.)

2266
01:28:09,019 --> 01:28:10,359
Kwang Soo.

2267
01:28:11,718 --> 01:28:14,558
Kwang Soo is so popular.

2268
01:28:14,558 --> 01:28:17,359
It's not something that we can witness in Korea.

2269
01:28:18,098 --> 01:28:19,628
Look at his unusual smile.

2270
01:28:21,569 --> 01:28:23,798
(They're grateful for the welcome.)

2271
01:28:24,668 --> 01:28:26,008
It still doesn't feel real.

2272
01:28:26,008 --> 01:28:27,008
(But they're here for the penalty.)

2273
01:28:27,168 --> 01:28:29,079
Why did you...

2274
01:28:30,338 --> 01:28:31,808
keep falling asleep?

2275
01:28:34,609 --> 01:28:36,119
- What? - It hurts.

2276
01:28:36,718 --> 01:28:37,779
I bumped my head.

2277
01:28:37,779 --> 01:28:38,989
(He's getting tired.)

2278
01:28:39,718 --> 01:28:41,489
Why did you keep falling asleep while I was talking?

2279
01:28:41,489 --> 01:28:42,758
(Asking a question again)

2280
01:28:42,758 --> 01:28:44,888
It's not that I fell asleep while you were talking.

2281
01:28:45,458 --> 01:28:47,189
You just kept on talking.

2282
01:28:47,189 --> 01:28:48,189
(Upset)

2283
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:49,359
There's a timing for everything.

2284
01:28:49,359 --> 01:28:50,798
But you never stopped talking. What am I supposed to do?

2285
01:28:51,458 --> 01:28:52,998
I couldn't sleep either.

2286
01:28:52,998 --> 01:28:54,199
(We're on the same boat.)

2287
01:28:54,199 --> 01:28:55,798
You ate gimbap yesterday.

2288
01:28:55,798 --> 01:28:57,338
I'm going to sleep. I need to save my energy.

2289
01:28:57,338 --> 01:28:58,968
And you ate it again this morning.

2290
01:28:58,968 --> 01:29:00,468
- Do you like gimbap? - For breakfast?

2291
01:29:00,468 --> 01:29:02,638
Do you want to bet on who can read more?

2292
01:29:02,909 --> 01:29:04,178
The books, I mean.

2293
01:29:04,779 --> 01:29:06,178
How about we play this game?

2294
01:29:06,178 --> 01:29:08,678
We'll open a book randomly and find names.

2295
01:29:08,918 --> 01:29:10,348
All right, let's play.

2296
01:29:10,348 --> 01:29:11,878
The one who wins twice first will win.

2297
01:29:12,079 --> 01:29:14,189
- Find what? - The page with more people on it.

2298
01:29:15,088 --> 01:29:17,458
How many more games do we need to play?

2299
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:19,428
- This is the last one. - I want to stop.

2300
01:29:19,558 --> 01:29:21,189
This will be our last game.

2301
01:29:21,458 --> 01:29:23,258
We've begun already.

2302
01:29:24,098 --> 01:29:25,998
I got a nosebleed while I was washing my face.

2303
01:29:25,998 --> 01:29:27,269
(Please cut me some slack.)

2304
01:29:27,269 --> 01:29:28,269
(Kwang Soo received an additional penalty while flying.)

2305
01:29:28,269 --> 01:29:29,338
This will be the last one.

2306
01:29:29,338 --> 01:29:30,369
(Kwang Soo received an additional penalty while flying.)

2307
01:29:30,968 --> 01:29:34,308
I looked at you after talking, and you were asleep.

2308
01:29:34,739 --> 01:29:36,338
My ears bled when you fell asleep.

2309
01:29:36,338 --> 01:29:37,378
(Please stop.)

2310
01:29:38,008 --> 01:29:39,149
(The bus heads to the accommodation.)

2311
01:29:39,149 --> 01:29:41,678
It feels strange since it's just the two of us.

2312
01:29:41,678 --> 01:29:42,779
It feels empty, right?

2313
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:45,048
- It kind of does. - Right.

2314
01:29:46,189 --> 01:29:47,888
We're really here.

2315
01:29:48,689 --> 01:29:49,718
We're here at last.

2316
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:50,718
(They're a step closer to the penalty.)

2317
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:52,729
I didn't know I'd actually come here.

2318
01:29:52,729 --> 01:29:54,888
(However, the trip hasn't even begun for real yet.)
