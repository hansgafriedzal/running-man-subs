1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,080
(Fall visits Running Man.)

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,980
(What is the race of the day that will unfold at a hanok cafe?)

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,980
- Hello. - Hello.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,949
- Hello. - Hello.

5
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:16,690
- Hello. - Hello.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,960
Due to the result of Half and Half Tour Race,

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,960
it was decided that Kwang Soo will go to the Cage of Death.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,960
That's right.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,070
(Kwang Soo, the expert of penalties...)

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,969
(gave a grand finale to the 3rd Global Project.)

11
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:32,570
(He will receive all 3 penalties of Global Project.)

12
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,469
(This time, he will swim with crocodiles in a cage.)

13
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,179
(Choose a member who will go with you.)

14
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:39,009
(Let's go with me, Kwang Soo.)

15
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:40,810
(Give me another week to decide.)

16
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,179
(Kwang Soo postponed choosing a member who will go with him.)

17
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,090
We prepared your last chance to avoid getting chosen,

18
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,689
Half and Half Tour Pass Race.

19
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:51,259
(It's to decide Kwang Soo's partner.)

20
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:55,060
(It's their last chance to avoid getting chosen.)

21
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,560
A member who acquires Half and Half Tour Pass...

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,570
will be exempted from Kwang Soo's choice.

23
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,869
- Really? - Okay.

24
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:04,170
The members who fail to acquire Half and Half Tour Pass...

25
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,200
will become the candidates Kwang Soo can choose from.

26
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,739
He could be a cool man and go by himself.

27
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:11,709
(There is no reason to do this.)

28
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:13,409
I will keep every word you say in mind.

29
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,909
I haven't made my choice yet.

30
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,819
Some people say that, but I disagree.

31
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:19,120
- I almost misunderstood. - That's right.

32
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,390
Please do me a favor.

33
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,390
(He makes a sudden request.)

34
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,420
Take me with you.

35
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,090
You should go with Jong Kook.

36
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,459
- Take the person who wants to go. - That's right.

37
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,260
If the glass breaks and the crocodiles attack,

38
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,930
I will protect you.

39
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,370
You are scarier than the crocodiles.

40
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,469
(Crocodiles, please stop Jong Kook.)

41
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:38,269
- Seriously. - You stress me out.

42
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:40,370
He can rip the jaw of a crocodile.

43
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,170
I can rip it. Give me a chance.

44
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,909
Here is a thing about the cowards.

45
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:46,810
A coward can only depend on another coward.

46
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,450
- Then the other one can sympathize. - A brave person won't help.

47
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,480
Of course.

48
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,549
I would rather go with my father than with Jong Kook.

49
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:53,950
(I would rather go with my father than with Jong Kook.)

50
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,750
- Is your father a coward? - My father and I will go...

51
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,890
- into the glass cage. - Is your father a coward?

52
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,659
It's rare for a son to reveal that his father is a coward.

53
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:03,159
- That's incredible. - He exposed his father.

54
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,260
That's how desperate I am.

55
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,769
- I want to go too, Kwang Soo. - Ji Hyo.

56
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,669
This gives me the creeps.

57
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,699
Why do you say that? I only said...

58
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,870
- I want to go. - This gives me the creeps.

59
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,939
You know it's terribly boring to team up with them.

60
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:18,439
- That's right. - They are good at everything.

61
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,810
Then I will sit inside the cage without anything to do.

62
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,750
"Look at those crocodiles!"

63
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,180
(It's Cage of Death even without the crocodiles.)

64
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,219
Since Kwang Soo is worried,

65
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,719
we've two guests who will help him with Half and Half Tour Pass Race.

66
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,189
- Half and Half Tour Pass Race. - Are there guests?

67
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:36,189
You should go with the guests.

68
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:40,629
(Who are the guests of the day?)

69
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:42,129
Bo Mi and Sung Rok.

70
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:45,000
- It's Bo Mi. - It's Bo Mi.

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,909
(They are a treat to her eyes.)

72
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:49,870
- My goodness. - It's Bo Mi.

73
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,939
- Hello, it has been a while. - Bo Mi.

74
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:53,810
She is like a family since she visits very often.

75
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,849
She is like a family.

76
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,680
Sung Rok and Bo Mi are here.

77
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,949
(They are here to aid Kwang Soo in choosing his partner.)

78
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,750
He's almost tall as you.

79
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,919
- Bo Mi. - Yes?

80
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,689
- Hello. - Have you been well?

81
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,360
Bo Mi, there used to be romance between us.

82
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
- That's right. - When was there such a thing?

83
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,330
(Do you remember the last time you were on Running Man?)

84
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,930
(In a bus number 362,)

85
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,300
(they had a match of holding hands.)

86
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:19,169
(Bo Mi, this is just a game.)

87
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:20,409
(Grinning)

88
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,849
(Like a rain shower in summer,)

89
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:31,349
(strange romance formed between Kwang Soo and Bo Mi.)

90
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:34,449
(It has been a while. How have you been?)

91
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:37,259
He told me that he will buy me a present from Japan.

92
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,159
(That's right.)

93
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,360
- Really? - Yes.

94
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,830
- Did he contact you afterwards? - He is shameless.

95
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,560
He video calls me when he is drunk.

96
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,599
(There is another thing.)

97
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:49,199
What?

98
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,099
What are you talking about? I didn't do that.

99
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:52,969
- Kwang Soo. - I didn't do that.

100
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:54,710
Don't speak nonsense. What are you talking about?

101
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,610
- Don't do that. - You really need to stop.

102
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,710
Did you try to flirt with her?

103
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,080
Bo Mi, it's a problem he has. Please understand.

104
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,680
He is ridiculous.

105
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,719
It wasn't like that. I think of her as a little sister.

106
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:08,949
Then why would you video call her?

107
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,419
I called with my own phone.

108
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,430
That's true. He's right about that.

109
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,699
- After the shoot last time... - Isn't it awkward to meet here?

110
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,160
I didn't know she would revisit so soon.

111
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,230
(He resents the production crew.)

112
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:23,939
- Hey. - I didn't know.

113
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:25,569
You shouldn't have video called her.

114
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:29,209
Bo Mi, you should let him know if you aren't interested.

115
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:32,540
- Make it clear. - I already made it clear.

116
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,579
(Bo Mi is firm.)

117
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:36,379
Really? What did you say to him?

118
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:37,949
- She already made it clear. - What did you say to him?

119
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,019
- Let me tell you honestly. - Okay.

120
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,649
I wasn't making a move on Bo Mi, but she suddenly rejected me.

121
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,920
I am serious. I am being honest.

122
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,259
- Did she suddenly reject you? - I thought she was a good friend.

123
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:51,199
I kept in touch with her since I thought of her as a friend.

124
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,870
- Okay. - Then texted me one night,

125
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:56,569
"You are making me uncomfortable."

126
00:04:56,569 --> 00:04:58,199
I was so surprised.

127
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,740
- She was getting ahead of herself. - I was so surprised.

128
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,910
- It's not like that. - Did you get ahead of yourself?

129
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,970
I bet Kwang Soo thought, "I haven't even started yet."

130
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,680
I texted her, "Bo Mi, I wasn't making a move on you."

131
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,279
"I am glad." That's how the conversation ended.

132
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,649
Sung Rok, I am sorry that this is "Kwang Soo's Love Game".

133
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:14,019
I am sorry.

134
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:15,350
I shouldn't have come.

135
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,759
- Don't say that. - I am sorry.

136
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,220
- Your time will come. - I had to tell this story.

137
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,029
- Will it come? - He looks like a sad dog.

138
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,899
- Why would you say that? - One of the Kakao friends.

139
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:26,029
His facial expression is similar to that of a character.

140
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,430
Sung Rok, you are in a musical.

141
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,800
He is a musical actor.

142
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,540
I heard it's a musical that is based on "Sandglass".

143
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,569
- Yes. - He plays Choi Min Soo's role.

144
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,980
"I thought doing this would let me have you."

145
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,550
(Everyone remembers Choi Min Soo from "Sandglass".)

146
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,680
(Sung Rok has a role of Park Tae Soo in the newest production.)

147
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,379
He has a similar face.

148
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,290
- That's right. - He is very tall.

149
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:49,449
How tall are you?

150
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,959
I am 189cm tall.

151
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,430
Despite the similar height, he seems different from Kwang Soo.

152
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,899
- How tall are you? - The proportions matter.

153
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,930
- I hate it when tall people visit. - Kwang Soo has a long face.

154
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,329
- That's right. - Kwang Soo has a long face.

155
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,740
Sung Rok's shoulders are broad too.

156
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,500
- He has nice hips too. - He must work out.

157
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,509
We have two guests today.

158
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:12,139
Before we go over the rules,

159
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,379
we will show you a video we prepared.

160
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:16,480
(A video?)

161
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,579
Is there another video?

162
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:19,819
They prepared a lot of videos.

163
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,290
Is it a video on a hint?

164
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,259
(A few days ago in SBS, Mok-dong)

165
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,889
- What? - What's this?

166
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,329
Plus one to be penalized in Australia.

167
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,470
- Is that you again? - Again?

168
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,300
What's the big deal about taking one more person?

169
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,699
It's time...

170
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,209
to make a decision.

171
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,509
I don't know whom I'll take.

172
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,410
Didn't you want to go with Jae Seok?

173
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,949
Shouldn't you take Jong Kook?

174
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,180
Is that a writer?

175
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,089
Everyone is a strong candidate.

176
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:55,889
For example,

177
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,019
Ji Hyo hasn't been penalized yet.

178
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:00,529
I don't remember the last time that she was.

179
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,730
I don't think she was for seven years.

180
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,529
What about So Min?

181
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:07,699
The reason why I'm here is So Min.

182
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:11,100
If So Min didn't distract me that day,

183
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:12,740
there wouldn't have been a problem.

184
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,610
So Min was penalized not so long ago. What about Haha?

185
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,939
Haha and Se Chan will go to New Zealand.

186
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:22,879
It'd be perfect if they stop in Australia on the way back.

187
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,649
- I agree. - That's perfect.

188
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:25,850
That sounds good.

189
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,120
(Who keeps giving Kwang Soo advice?)

190
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,490
It's not easy to decide.

191
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,860
Today...

192
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,629
No matter what,

193
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,000
I'll follow what the assistants say.

194
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:42,430
(I'll follow what the assistants say.)

195
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,740
- Assistants? - Assistants?

196
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:45,300
- Assistants? - Assistants?

197
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,069
They must be the assistants.

198
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:48,209
- Really? - No.

199
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:49,470
I don't think so.

200
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,439
Are they the assistants?

201
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,879
As you saw on the video,

202
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:58,620
there are assistants amongst you who will help Kwang Soo decide.

203
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,920
(There are assistants amongst the 10 members.)

204
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:04,420
As you saw on the video...

205
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,829
(Unidentified assistants who help Kwang Soo decide)

206
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:10,860
(While hiding their identity,)

207
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,100
(the assistants will help Kwang Soo decide.)

208
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,569
That's why So Min has been quiet.

209
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:17,470
(That's why So Min has been quiet.)

210
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,600
Stop it, Haha.

211
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:23,240
- Why is it always me? - She was with Kwang Soo.

212
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,709
- Right. - It's neither Bo Mi nor Sung Rok?

213
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:26,949
- I don't think so. - Listen.

214
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,620
You get a video clip hint when you clear a mission.

215
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,450
The member who arrests the assistants before the end...

216
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,190
of the race will be exempted from being penalized.

217
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,289
Is that so?

218
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,889
Are we exempted if we arrest the assistants?

219
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:44,700
If you arrest them, you win an exemption pass.

220
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,500
If all members fail to arrest the assistants,

221
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,870
Kwang Soo and the assistants win.

222
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,200
Kwang Soo may choose two members...

223
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,139
- to take to Australia. - Two members?

224
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:56,710
- Will 3 of us go? - 2 members?

225
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,139
- Why 2? - Will 3 members go?

226
00:08:58,139 --> 00:08:59,940
(Kwang Soo and assistants versus the rest)

227
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,379
I feel much better.

228
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:04,220
Do the assistants know who they are?

229
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,250
Right.

230
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,490
All answers are in the video clips available if you clear the missions.

231
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,059
(Video clips contain hints.)

232
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:13,529
- They're in the video clips. - I'm not it.

233
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:16,899
Please get changed, and we'll start the race.

234
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:17,960
Let's go.

235
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,000
- Let's go. - We have no hints yet.

236
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,399
- I don't think it's Seok Jin. - It's not me.

237
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,169
He isn't ready to take such a big role.

238
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,470
(Who are Kwang Soo's assistants today?)

239
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,909
Here's the first mission for which you can win a hint.

240
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:37,850
It's called Bell Hide and Seek: Kwang Soo, Let's Play.

241
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,450
(Bell Hide and Seek: Kwang Soo, Let's Play)

242
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:42,690
Is it Bell Hide and Seek?

243
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,960
It's been a long time.

244
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:47,659
The time limit is five minutes. As the seeker, Kwang Soo may...

245
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:51,559
eliminate other members by touching them.

246
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,799
The time limit is five minutes.

247
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:57,470
As the seeker, Kwang Soo may eliminate...

248
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,539
other members by touching them.

249
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:01,509
Kwang Soo won't look for Bo Mi today.

250
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:04,340
(Kwang Soo won't look for Bo Mi today.)

251
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,409
Why not?

252
00:10:05,409 --> 00:10:07,080
- Why? - He can call her on video.

253
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,850
What are you talking about?

254
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,519
What do you mean by video call?

255
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:12,120
- You can call her. - Wait.

256
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,419
You probably feel awkward, so I'll stand in between.

257
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:16,190
- What? - Stop it, Jae Seok.

258
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:18,059
- Don't you feel awkward? - What are you talking about?

259
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:20,129
- Are you okay? - I don't feel awkward.

260
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:22,090
- She said, "I don't feel awkward." - Is that so?

261
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,600
(Will their romance start again today?)

262
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,169
The other members will put on a bell and hide.

263
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,500
Stay hidden during the time limit...

264
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,970
or run away before being eliminated.

265
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:35,070
(If you touch the stuffed crocodile on the coffee table, you survive.)

266
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:39,480
If you touch the stuffed crocodile on the coffee table, you survive.

267
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,710
- Stuffed crocodile? - Crocodile?

268
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,980
If Kwang Soo sees someone...

269
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,519
and touches the crocodile after shouting the member's name,

270
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,149
then the member is eliminated.

271
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,720
- If he says the name? - I see.

272
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,950
Once he sees someone?

273
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,860
Do I have to touch it by hand?

274
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,659
May I kick it?

275
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:55,029
- Isn't that touching? - Yes.

276
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,200
May I defend myself by punching?

277
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,529
(May I defend myself by punching?)

278
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:01,970
You'd be eliminated by him.

279
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,940
His chin would touch your fist.

280
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,370
- By the way... - I don't care.

281
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:08,269
- He doesn't care. - I don't.

282
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:12,409
If I touch someone with a weapon, is that considered touching?

283
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:13,750
- No. - No?

284
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,809
(That's so funny.)

285
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:19,179
Since we haven't seen Bo Mi in a while,

286
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,789
let's see her kick.

287
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:21,820
Shall we?

288
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,090
(Let's see Bo Mi's kick.)

289
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,389
- Her kick? - That's so random.

290
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,259
I had forgotten about it, but I remembered her kick.

291
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,600
(8 years of training make her fierce.)

292
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:38,899
(According to Seok Jin and Jae Seok,)

293
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,740
(their bruise lasted for a week.)

294
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:46,909
I had forgotten about it, but I remembered her kick.

295
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:49,009
- Remember the kick? - All of a sudden?

296
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,850
- Come out, Kwang Soo. - It was sudden.

297
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,750
- Kwang Soo. - Me?

298
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,120
Kick Kwang Soo's leg.

299
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,519
- Come out, Kwang Soo. - That's right.

300
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,759
- Me? - Kick Kwang Soo's leg.

301
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:00,860
Me?

302
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,429
Let's see it.

303
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:04,460
You don't need to stretch, Bo Mi.

304
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:06,360
Why is it me?

305
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,100
Brace yourself. She's strong.

306
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,529
- You might get injured. - He's weak.

307
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,669
If Kwang Soo doesn't fall or make a sound...

308
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,940
once he gets kicked, we'll give you...

309
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,169
30 more seconds to seek.

310
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,240
- 30 seconds? - Really?

311
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,309
- This is worth it. - Okay.

312
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:20,850
(He'll be given 30 more seconds during Hide and Seek.)

313
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,620
(If he endures the pain,)

314
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,889
(he may stop others from getting the video clip hint.)

315
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,159
(She kicks him hard.)

316
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:32,190
(My goodness)

317
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,259
(He falls down.)

318
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:39,360
(Bo Mi's kick impresses everyone.)

319
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,000
Goodness.

320
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,169
I'm sorry.

321
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,600
I thought a giraffe fell down...

322
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,100
- in the savanna. - I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

323
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,970
(He looks like a falling giraffe in the savanna.)

324
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:52,610
- Seriously. - My goodness.

325
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,909
- Bo Mi. - I'm sorry.

326
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:57,120
I'm so sorry, Kwang Soo.

327
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,250
Will it be transferred on screen?

328
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,919
- I don't think so. - Seriously.

329
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,950
- Sung Rok... - He looked like...

330
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,590
- laughed at him. - a falling skyscraper.

331
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,820
- Really? - He laughed.

332
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,330
Did you?

333
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,690
He laughed at him.

334
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,899
I saw him.

335
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:12,929
Be honest.

336
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,129
Do you think that Kwang Soo exaggerated?

337
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,269
Tell us honestly.

338
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:19,399
- He's definitely an entertainer. - I know.

339
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:20,539
That's what I thought.

340
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:23,039
It's true that Kwang Soo...

341
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:25,240
- He exaggerated. - exaggerated.

342
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:28,750
If Sung Rok endures the pain, he may put on 1 bell instead of 2.

343
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,809
Okay.

344
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,320
It's beyond what you imagine.

345
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:33,950
Okay.

346
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,049
(Bo Mi kicks hard.)

347
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:39,159
(However, Kwang Soo did exaggerate.)

348
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:41,830
(Sung Rok's pride is on the line.)

349
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:43,399
(Screaming)

350
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,769
(His reaction is dramatic.)

351
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,070
(He crawls.)

352
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:56,110
He looked like a paulownia tree...

353
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:57,879
My goodness.

354
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,250
He broke into two.

355
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,679
She kicks really hard.

356
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,179
Kwang Soo wasn't acting.

357
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,379
Seriously.

358
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,090
- I'm sorry. - How was it?

359
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,149
Sung Rok.

360
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,850
How hard was it?

361
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,990
- Wait. - He's stumbling. Are you okay?

362
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,190
Wait. My muscles are tense.

363
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:16,590
She kicked me before. The bruise lasted a week.

364
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:18,429
- Are you okay? - I'm so sorry.

365
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:19,929
Let's get started now.

366
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:20,970
By the way,

367
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,700
has she kicked Jong Kook before?

368
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,340
It's not fun for me.

369
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,169
My goodness.

370
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,440
What do you mean?

371
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,139
It's not fun when he doesn't want to do it.

372
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,139
It's fun when he wants to do it.

373
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,309
- It's not fun. - Hurry up.

374
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:34,049
Don't live that way.

375
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:35,350
Why wouldn't it be fun?

376
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,820
- Come on. - Try it.

377
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,320
- It may be funny. - Listen.

378
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,779
- It's not fun. - Let's do this.

379
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,750
- It won't hurt me. - Se Chan, Jong Kook...

380
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,789
and I.

381
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:44,320
- Include Haha. - Right.

382
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,360
- One of us gets kicked. - Okay.

383
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,960
- Don't exclude Seok Jin. - Jae Seok.

384
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,360
- Seok Jin... - Why would you include us?

385
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,059
She kicked me very hard last time.

386
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:54,370
We must be included to make Jong Kook participate.

387
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,529
(Make Jong Kook get picked.)

388
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:56,899
Stop that.

389
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:59,139
- What am I doing? - Stop it.

390
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:01,710
Is it five of us?

391
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:03,679
Let's draw straws to pick one person.

392
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:05,610
Here are five straws.

393
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,509
There's one dud.

394
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:10,879
This is what Sung Rok told me.

395
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,620
"It was real."

396
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,649
We don't act.

397
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:17,220
- You weren't acting. - You became pale.

398
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,220
- You're sweating too. - It's real.

399
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,659
It really hurts.

400
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,730
Don't look at the straws.

401
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:25,000
Don't look.

402
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,000
- The rest of you can see it. - One.

403
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,899
- It really hurts. - 1, 2, 3.

404
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:31,269
(Who will be the unlucky one?)

405
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,610
Let's see.

406
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,169
(Haha gets picked.)

407
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:37,379
- Now, - She shows no reaction.

408
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:38,639
fold the paper.

409
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,779
Decide if you'll exchange.

410
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:42,450
I will keep mine.

411
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:43,879
- Wait a minute. - I'll keep mine.

412
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:45,220
- Let's exchange. - I won't.

413
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,720
I won't change mine.

414
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,289
- Let's exchange. - No.

415
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:49,620
Come on.

416
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,190
- Let's exchange. - Okay.

417
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,889
- Let's exchange. - Okay.

418
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:56,659
(Haha exchanges his unlucky draw with Seok Jin.)

419
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:57,730
- Wait a minute. - Did they exchange?

420
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,399
- Why? - I don't know.

421
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,730
- I won't exchange. - Let's exchange.

422
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,830
Who wants to exchange?

423
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,129
For now...

424
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,299
(Singing)

425
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:06,000
My goodness.

426
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:08,840
(Will you exchange with mine?)

427
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,409
- What's going on? - It's not me.

428
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:12,039
This is what everyone does.

429
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,710
- Everyone does this. - It isn't me.

430
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,279
- When Seok Jin offers his straw... - Seok Jin.

431
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,279
(He freezes.)

432
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,419
Is it me?

433
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:18,820
(They couldn't hide their reaction.)

434
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,919
It's because...

435
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,220
Seriously?

436
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:23,759
- You're not going to switch, right? - No.

437
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,820
If it's me, I'm...

438
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,220
- 1, 2... - 1.

439
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,889
(Peeking)

440
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:29,029
Then...

441
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,700
(I see.)

442
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,870
1, 2...

443
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,799
It's just a simple kick. You'll get it...

444
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,500
- like Kwang Soo and Sung Rok. - Right.

445
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,340
- 1, 2, 3. - Wait. We'll switch.

446
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,110
- What? - We'll switch.

447
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,809
What? What is it?

448
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:44,039
- Let's switch. - Did you see letters?

449
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,409
No, no. I didn't read it yet.

450
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:47,309
- Should I switch mine with his? - You should give that a try.

451
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:50,220
I swear. I saw Seok Jin taking a peek.

452
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:52,179
I did too!

453
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:53,789
I can bet my entire savings.

454
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,250
(Common action taken by liars being caught in action)

455
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,360
No, I didn't see it!

456
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,190
- I saw him reading it. - It's not me.

457
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,230
- I'll bet my entire savings. - Wait.

458
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,230
- No. - I saw him.

459
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,830
- Why me? She kicked me last time. - Go. I didn't get it, did I?

460
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,299
- Why did I switch mine with you? - It was you, Haha.

461
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:07,170
- It was supposed to be me. - Let's not do this.

462
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,829
Let's hurry. Let's get it over with and move on. We don't have time.

463
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,970
- You should get the kick too! - Get the kick, and move on.

464
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,940
Get the kick, and put it behind us.

465
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,369
- He wants to get rid of Seok Jin. - Get the kick, and move on.

466
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,740
- Hurry. - As we talked about before,

467
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,750
- he'll get it, and be gone. - We already wasted too much time.

468
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,450
- I'm fine. I can endure the kick. - Watch your hands.

469
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,049
- Face forward. - My thighs can handle her kick.

470
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,289
Let's get rid of him. Let's put him away.

471
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:29,220
- Goodness. - Put him somewhere else.

472
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,690
(He got the kick and was removed.)

473
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:35,789
(Even before his pain goes away, he was dragged out.)

474
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,700
- I'm really sorry. - This will do it.

475
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,029
- Let's film. - That's good.

476
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,869
- Let's continue shooting. - Let's start.

477
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:43,799
- Seok Jin. - Let's film.

478
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,940
- Can we really leave him here? - That's fine, Bo Mi.

479
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:47,670
He's all right.

480
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,910
It hurts so much! It seriously hurts!

481
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,779
- We respect you. - Respect!

482
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:56,680
All right.

483
00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:01,150
Only the members who survive in the game will be given the video.

484
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:03,019
If the tagger eliminates everyone,

485
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:05,720
- the video won't be given to you. - Really?

486
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,660
- Kwang Soo will enter the house. - Okay.

487
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:11,500
One of the members outside has to ring the bell.

488
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,759
(1 member must press the bell.)

489
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,599
The member must say, "Let's play, Kwang Soo", ring the bell and hide.

490
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:17,099
So you may choose the member among yourselves.

491
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:18,940
The one who will ring the bell is Seok Jin.

492
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,369
(The member is already predestined.)

493
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:22,170
- Seok Jin will press it. - You're trying to get me.

494
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,170
(He was kicked and dragged out.)

495
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,140
- Seok Jin will press it. - You're trying to get me.

496
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,279
(He will run faster and differently from the others.)

497
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:29,180
All right. We'll tie the bells on you now.

498
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,650
Kwang Soo, please go inside the house.

499
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,450
(Members put on the bells, and Kwang Soo goes inside the house.)

500
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,390
(This is the stuffed crocodile members and Kwang Soo must touch.)

501
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,660
This is the stuffed crocodile.

502
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:41,529
Haha took a peek.

503
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,799
I should keep the assistants alive to avert any suspicion.

504
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,900
(I should keep the assistants alive to avert any suspicion.)

505
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:54,410
The rest of you may hide with your own cameras.

506
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,240
How far can I go?

507
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,779
But isn't this space too small?

508
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:01,250
(They must make good use of the cafe and the sculptures.)

509
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,210
(Ji Hyo will ring the bell.)

510
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,779
Gosh, I'm horrible at hiding.

511
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:08,289
Hey, Jae Seok, no. This is my spot.

512
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,789
- Jae Seok. - I was heading there.

513
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,589
This is my strategy.

514
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:13,759
(This is a popular place among cunning members.)

515
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,430
(It's the space behind the rock which is close to the house.)

516
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,069
Hey, you have to run away well too.

517
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,839
(Jong Kook enters the kitchen of the cafe.)

518
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:26,299
I can lie down. Is there a blanket or something?

519
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,569
(Behind the refrigerator seems nice, but I need more.)

520
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,509
(He's patient, and puts effort even into the game.)

521
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:37,420
(Hide well, Jong Kook. Otherwise, your muscles will be spotted.)

522
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,220
(Haha hides behind the house which is an innovative strategy.)

523
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,319
No one will find me here.

524
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:44,220
You should hide there and film me.

525
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,789
(This genius of hide and seek even commands the cameraman.)

526
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,059
(Jingling)

527
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,630
I guess someone's here.

528
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,269
Darn. You are here.

529
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,339
- Do you want to come? - Are you going to take that space?

530
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:02,069
- We can hear the sound from there. - We should get out then.

531
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:04,079
(Haha and Seok Jin hide behind the house together.)

532
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,150
(Where should I hide?)

533
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,609
Stay here. No, you should stay here.

534
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,819
Let me. Let me just stay here for a while.

535
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:13,549
(As a new, cunning member, she hides among the crew's equipment.)

536
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,549
(Go back to work, please.)

537
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,390
No, stay there. Please you can stay.

538
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,420
(Go back to work, please.)

539
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,630
(This is perfect. I'm satisfied.)

540
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,829
It's perfect.

541
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:25,059
Thank you, everyone.

542
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:28,230
Thank you. I love you, all.

543
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,329
(I'll be the audio equipment for 5 minutes.)

544
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:31,769
10 seconds before the race starts!

545
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,109
(The hint video is at stake on the 1st round of the game.)

546
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:38,480
(They must touch the crocodile first or not get caught for 5 minutes.)

547
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,109
(If he finds members and touches the crocodile, they're eliminated.)

548
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:43,049
2, 1.

549
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:47,289
Kwang Soo, let's play!

550
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:51,319
- 1, 2, 3, 4... - Kwang Soo, let's play!

551
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:54,059
(The tagger must count to 10 and start looking for them.)

552
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,529
9, 10.

553
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,200
(The 1st round of Kwang Soo, Let's Play starts.)

554
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,569
(Ji Hyo hides behind the rock swiftly.)

555
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:03,099
- Hey. - Hold on.

556
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:07,140
(As soon as she hides, Kwang Soo ventures out.)

557
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,109
(Where did you all hide?)

558
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:12,480
How can she hide so quickly?

559
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,319
(Bo Mi is hiding behind the stairs.)

560
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,849
The space is so small.

561
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:22,650
(You did a good job of hiding in this limited space.)

562
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:28,160
(Please don't come here.)

563
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,599
(He enters the cafe which radiates a suspicious vibe.)

564
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:40,140
(Sung Rok is hiding right in the center of the cafe.)

565
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,880
(If things go wrong, he might get caught.)

566
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,809
(Rattling)

567
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:51,319
(Oh, no!)

568
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,019
(I heard a sound from somewhere around here.)

569
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:55,890
(This is the place Seok Jin and Haha are hiding.)

570
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,559
(The tagger has gotten close. When he turns, they're caught.)

571
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,930
(Feeling nervous)

572
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,599
(Meanwhile, this guy was about to get caught by Kwang Soo.)

573
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:12,400
(Kwang Soo is occupied searching the back.)

574
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,910
(This is my chance!)

575
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,509
(Sung Rok, let me go with you!)

576
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:24,549
(Bo Mi who was hiding behind the staircase is running.)

577
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:26,849
(And Ji Hyo and Se Chan who were behind the rock are running.)

578
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,519
Hurry up, and run.

579
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:30,960
(This is the chance to touch it without the tagger present.)

580
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,630
(No! My crocodile!)

581
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:40,269
(Four of them enter the house in order.)

582
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:41,369
Move aside.

583
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:42,670
(Four of them enter the house in order.)

584
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,970
(Sung Rok, Bo Mi, Se Chan, and Ji Hyo get to watch the hint video.)

585
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,569
Hey, you idiot.

586
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:51,309
Four of them touched it?

587
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:52,880
- Goodness. - I...

588
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,309
- I mean, Kwang Soo... - Four of them got it?

589
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:56,109
Bo Mi, you are so fast.

590
00:22:56,849 --> 00:22:59,420
Darn. I'm so bad at this.

591
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,089
I am bad at this.

592
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:02,789
(Members who are still hiding)

593
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:04,519
Where did they hide? They can't possibly hide here.

594
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:06,119
(Members who are still hiding)

595
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,890
I can hear the bells. The bells.

596
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,700
(Seok Jin observed how the four members succeeded.)

597
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,230
(Kwang Soo is far from the house, and this is my chance!)

598
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,769
(Seok Jin, the oldie, makes a run for it.)

599
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
(In an instant...)

600
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,910
(What just happened?)

601
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:29,049
(Why is he running so fiercely?)

602
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,819
(Laughing)

603
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:34,119
(Skipping)

604
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:36,549
Seok Jin is eliminated!

605
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:41,029
(Seok Jin gets eliminated easily.)

606
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:42,630
I saw that coming, Seok Jin.

607
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,329
He was walking, not running.

608
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:49,170
I felt so bad when I touched the crocodile.

609
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,200
(His slow run broke Kwang Soo's heart.)

610
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,509
I can't find them no matter how thoroughly I look.

611
00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:55,940
(Members who are still hiding)

612
00:23:56,539 --> 00:23:59,579
(He arrives in front of the sound team where So Min is hiding.)

613
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,079
(Something is fishy here.)

614
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,420
(So Min disguised herself as the equipment.)

615
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:13,690
(Excuse me. Hold on.)

616
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:17,200
(Ringing)

617
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,599
(I must get out of here now.)

618
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,329
He's not here? Where is he?

619
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,440
(So Min can't see what's in front of her well.)

620
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,769
What? What is this?

621
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,039
You're out.

622
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:30,809
- So Min, you're eliminated. - Kwang Soo, I...

623
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,279
You're out.

624
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,250
I literally tapped you like 30 times.

625
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:36,509
You should know when you've been eliminated.

626
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,650
Until when you are going to hide?

627
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,890
I thought for sure that it was a guy, but it was So Min.

628
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:47,789
(So Min is eliminated despite her embarrassing efforts.)

629
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,829
- 10 seconds before the race ends. - I'm doomed.

630
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,970
- 10, 9... - Wait.

631
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,200
(Did they fly to the sky or go into the ground?)

632
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:58,599
(All he can see are the crew and the empty field.)

633
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,369
(Let's hold out for 5 more seconds.)

634
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:06,809
(Where on earth is everyone else?)

635
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:09,750
- 2, 1. - Hold on a second.

636
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,650
(Kwang Soo, Let's Play is over.)

637
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,849
- Please be over. - One!

638
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:15,019
Great! I did it.

639
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:18,119
- Where did they hide? They're good. - All right.

640
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:20,289
Bell Hide and Seek has ended. Show yourselves!

641
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:25,660
(He sticks his head out.)

642
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,400
(You didn't know this, did you?)

643
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,569
- What? Seriously? - You didn't find me here, did you?

644
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:31,470
How could a person fit there?

645
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,769
- Kwang Soo. - I mean...

646
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:34,240
What were you doing?

647
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,670
How could I find you here?

648
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:37,440
Why not?

649
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,140
I thought it was a pile of garbage.

650
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:41,880
Did you only find one member?

651
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,450
I found So Min and Seok Jin.

652
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,119
- Goodness. - Oh, my.

653
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,349
My legs went numb.

654
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,920
(He's enjoying the victory too.)

655
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,430
Goodness. I have pins and needles in my legs.

656
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,230
- Ji Hyo, where were you? - Where did you hide?

657
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,529
I was in the kitchen.

658
00:25:57,529 --> 00:25:59,029
- I was in the kitchen whole time. - Let me see.

659
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:00,329
- I even checked the drawers. - Hey.

660
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:02,200
- Goodness. - Why would you check the drawers?

661
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:04,940
This time, Kwang Soo must find members who will hide...

662
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,809
inside the house and eliminate them within five minutes.

663
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:13,039
(The same rules apply. He must find members hiding inside the house.)

664
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:15,880
This time, I need some clues from the assistants.

665
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,319
We have to find out who the assistants are among us.

666
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:22,589
So there are the assistants.

667
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,319
Are you the assistant? Are you going to make a noise?

668
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:28,230
No, I'm not.

669
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,029
- Are you the assistant? - Will you shout?

670
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:31,930
- No. - The female assistant might be her.

671
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,930
Sung Rok is suspicious too.

672
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,970
Sung Rok looks like he's the assistant.

673
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,039
Very much.

674
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:40,970
- I can tell by his face. - What? Gosh.

675
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:47,579
(Will they be able to get a clue regarding who the assistants are?)

676
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,279
It's 10 seconds before the race starts.

677
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:54,490
5, 4...

678
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,619
(They must stay in hiding for 5 minutes...)

679
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:56,619
(or touch the crocodile before Kwang Soo does.)

680
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,220
- 2. - 2.

681
00:26:58,289 --> 00:26:59,720
- Open it when he enters. - One.

682
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:05,500
(If he finds a member and touch them or the crocodile, they are out.)

683
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:09,130
(Ringing)

684
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,869
(Jae Seok begins his plan as soon as he hears the doorbell.)

685
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:13,509
Let me go out first.

686
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:17,910
(While Kwang Soo tries to enter the house,)

687
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:22,950
(he plans to run outside and touch the crocodile.)

688
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,349
Let me go out first.

689
00:27:27,349 --> 00:27:28,789
Hold on.

690
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,690
Jae Seok is eliminated.

691
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,859
(He gets eliminated only after 2 seconds.)

692
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:37,329
- Gosh, I thought it was a ghost. - Oh, dear.

693
00:27:37,329 --> 00:27:39,259
- Gosh. - You startled me.

694
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:41,299
- Goodness. - I mean, why...

695
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,740
- What are you doing? - Seok Jin is behind me.

696
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,799
Seok Jin is behind me.

697
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:52,609
(Jae Seok tries to drag Seok Jin down with him.)

698
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,579
(Thank you for the nice information.)

699
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:57,720
I should go inside the room.

700
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,890
- Hey. - Seok Jin, you're out.

701
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,660
- I should go inside the room. - Hey.

702
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,119
(Seok Jin gets eliminated thanks to Jae Seok.)

703
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,559
- You can touch me to eliminate me? - What?

704
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,359
- Hey. - What?

705
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,430
- Isn't this too much? - Hold on.

706
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,769
(Why is he running when he's already out?)

707
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:19,240
(Jong Kook quietly watches them from next door.)

708
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,779
(Kwang Soo checks the windows first after eliminating the two.)

709
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:25,809
Who's that?

710
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:27,809
I think someone got caught. Oh, dear.

711
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:29,309
Goodness.

712
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,950
(While Kwang Soo is busy checking the room next door...)

713
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:38,119
(Now is the time!)

714
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,119
Wait a second.

715
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,829
(He climbs over the window and runs straight to the crocodile.)

716
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:44,529
(He touches down with an incredible speed.)

717
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:45,529
It's scary.

718
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:49,869
(This is Jong Kook.)

719
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:51,700
(Is he a human being or a spring?)

720
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,700
Is he out?

721
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:55,109
I was going to touch him first.

722
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:57,509
(Jong Kook succeeds.)

723
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,579
(He's checking on Haha's window.)

724
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,210
Gosh.

725
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:07,789
(The ace watches for a chance and runs with leisure.)

726
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:08,789
Kwang Soo.

727
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:10,920
When did you come out?

728
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:16,390
(Sung Rok succeeds as well.)

729
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,730
You're really bad at this.

730
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,529
(While Kwang Soo enters the house,)

731
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:21,930
(Haha tries to climb over the window swiftly.)

732
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,029
Haha's coming outside.

733
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,099
- Haha's slow. - You're out.

734
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,769
(Haha fails to succeed.)

735
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,839
(Bo Mi was hiding behind the sofa.)

736
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:34,779
(She comes out through the back door.)

737
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,380
- Oh, no! - Bo Mi.

738
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,420
(Bo Mi succeeds.)

739
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,990
- Bo Mi's good. - Where were you?

740
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,089
Can you hide outside?

741
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,490
(There are only So Min and Se Chan left.)

742
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,859
(He's determined to catch them.)

743
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:54,769
(So Min plans to escape from the house like Jong Kook did.)

744
00:29:56,769 --> 00:30:01,910
(Let's fly like a butterfly and run away from Kwang Soo.)

745
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:06,950
(Will So Min's plan succeed?)

746
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:09,849
It won't open.

747
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:11,920
What?

748
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,690
(What's going on?)

749
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,220
Is this how you open it?

750
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,160
I need to get out of here, but it won't open.

751
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,289
It won't open.

752
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:24,299
(She can't even open the window.)

753
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,039
(He heard a loud bell sound in this room.)

754
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:32,440
(He walks straight to the pillar.)

755
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,940
So Min, you're really bad at hiding.

756
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,740
(So Min, you're really bad at hiding.)

757
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,109
- You're terrible at this game. - I mean...

758
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:40,880
- The window won't open. - You're bad at this.

759
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,980
This window won't open.

760
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,680
- You opened it in a wrong way. - That's why I couldn't...

761
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,920
(She wanted to escape like the Catwoman.)

762
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,720
You have a minute left.

763
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,490
(There's only Se Chan left in hiding.)

764
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,319
(Where are you, Se Chan?)

765
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:56,829
(Seok Jin suddenly enters the house.)

766
00:30:56,829 --> 00:30:57,829
Se Chan, come out.

767
00:30:57,829 --> 00:30:59,829
(Se Chan, come out.)

768
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:00,869
Se Chan, now is the time.

769
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:02,670
(Seok Jin tells him to come out.)

770
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,069
Se Chan, come out now.

771
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,369
(Seok Jin tells him to come out when Kwang Soo is around.)

772
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,210
- What? - Se Chan.

773
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,640
Seok Jin is helping Kwang Soo catch Se Chan.

774
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:18,279
(He could've gotten eliminated if he came out.)

775
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,480
(What's going on outside?)

776
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,220
He's really cunning.

777
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:25,589
How could he... Can he be so obvious in helping Kwang Soo?

778
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:27,490
- What's that? - He's cunning.

779
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,930
I only tried to help Se Chan.

780
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:33,529
You're terrible at being the assistant.

781
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:34,769
I know it's you.

782
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,400
You're terrible at being the assistant.

783
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
(Flustered)

784
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,910
By the way, why aren't the assistants doing their job?

785
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,309
Haha, why aren't you doing anything?

786
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:45,240
You just did your job.

787
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:47,480
You talked with Kwang Soo a while ago too.

788
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,579
- You taught him where we were. - You should do your job.

789
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:52,250
I asked you what you were doing and you got flustered.

790
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:56,119
(The second round of Kwang Soo, Let's Play ends.)

791
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:58,160
- Please come outside. - Goodness.

792
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,819
How could you not find Se Chan?

793
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,660
- He's nowhere to be found. - He's not in here.

794
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,329
(Where did Se Chan hide?)

795
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:04,329
I searched everywhere.

796
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:05,660
(Where did Se Chan hide?)

797
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:10,369
- He's in there? - Here.

798
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,670
- Really? - My goodness.

799
00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:14,740
I didn't even know these doors can open.

800
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,269
I almost got caught.

801
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,210
- You're amazing. - I told you to come out.

802
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,809
I knew Kwang Soo was around.

803
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:22,279
Right. You heard him, right?

804
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:24,380
- Yes, I heard. - I even saw him do it.

805
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,220
You really shouldn't do that.

806
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,589
You made it so obvious.

807
00:32:27,589 --> 00:32:29,650
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

808
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,119
He really wasn't around.

809
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,430
Se Chan heard him say things to Kwang Soo.

810
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,630
No, we shouldn't assume.

811
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:43,269
When we look at it in a broader way, he's too weak to be the assistant.

812
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,009
You're exactly right.

813
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,539
Look at it as a whole.

814
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,640
- Hey. - Gosh.

815
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,480
I never said I'm the assistant.

816
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,309
- He's too weak... - I never said that.

817
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:56,150
He's too weak to be the assistant.

818
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,720
Can I change my assistants?

819
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,289
(Can I change my assistants?)

820
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,890
You're making it sound like I'm the assistant.

821
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:07,329
All right, I'll give the video hint to Haha and Sung Rok...

822
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:10,500
since they placed first in each round.

823
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,630
Please step forward.

824
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,069
- Okay. - Oh, you'll show us with that.

825
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,339
I'm 100 percent sure either one of them is the assistant.

826
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:19,440
- Gosh. - They'll watch the hint now.

827
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:20,809
I'm 100 percent sure.

828
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:22,769
(He's calling us the assistant.)

829
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:25,309
He says the assistant is either me or Sung Rok.

830
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:27,410
- I'm sure. - He's sure of it.

831
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,779
And he's the assistant himself.

832
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,720
We'll watch it now.

833
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,420
(They watch the first video hint.)

834
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:35,920
I'm very much worried.

835
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:39,289
To be honest, I'm not lucky in basically every game.

836
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,660
I have no luck in spinning roulettes.

837
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,890
I have no luck in playing Dreadful Pirate either.

838
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,529
That's why I'm worried I might be unlucky this time as well.

839
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:49,599
I'm pretty much the same as you.

840
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,599
Shall we go exorcise or something?

841
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,440
What should we do? I have no luck either.

842
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:59,039
Now that I think about it, it's most likely that we won't succeed.

843
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,779
What are you talking about?

844
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,549
We must succeed no matter what.

845
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:07,990
Here's something positive.

846
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:11,190
A lot of the members aren't that lucky either.

847
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:12,920
A lot of them.

848
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,659
Let's get this done. Thank you in advance.

849
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:19,500
(We aren't lucky, but we can do this.)

850
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,570
It's for certain.

851
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,739
I'm so curious.

852
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,469
- You know who they are? - They can't share the hint, right?

853
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:31,880
- They can't share it with others. - The first hint is big.

854
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,909
Gosh, what should I do, Chul Min?

855
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,510
Shall we do this again?

856
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,519
(It's too certain.)

857
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:38,519
Did the hint say his nose is big?

858
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,920
- Tell me. - I won't say anything.

859
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,650
I'm free next week.

860
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:45,159
(Is Seok Jin really the assistant?)

861
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,159
(Or is Kwang Soo only pretending?)

862
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,230
I'm free all week as well.

863
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:51,800
(They're narrowing down the assistant candidates.)

864
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,000
- It's cool and nice in here. - This won't do.

865
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,269
Goodness.

866
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,139
- Sit down. - Let's sit down.

867
00:34:58,139 --> 00:34:59,139
What's wrong, Bo Mi?

868
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,440
Oh, I'm just hungry.

869
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,469
- Gosh, I thought you were sick. - No, I'm not.

870
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,239
I'm really hungry too.

871
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,880
Are you hungry?

872
00:35:05,909 --> 00:35:07,210
- Yes. - Very much.

873
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,050
It's lunchtime now.

874
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,920
We've prepared a menu for your lunch.

875
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,920
- Really? - Please make orders.

876
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,889
I'm sure they won't give us food for free.

877
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,760
There it is.

878
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,519
- Here comes the menu. - It's Chinese cuisine.

879
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:20,530
- Gosh. - Shrimp fried rice.

880
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,429
- I want shrimp fried rice. - I'll take what I want to have.

881
00:35:22,429 --> 00:35:23,429
Here. Let me hold this for you.

882
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,760
- Will we have to play some game? - Jjajangmyeon.

883
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,030
- I'm having what I want to have. - I'll have jjajangmyeon.

884
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,869
- I'll have jjamppong. - There's ulmyeon too.

885
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:31,340
- They all sound delicious. - It's either jjamppong or jjajang.

886
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,239
- Gosh. - Can I take seafood jjamppong?

887
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:34,639
I don't eat seafood.

888
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:35,809
I'll take japchae.

889
00:35:35,909 --> 00:35:38,510
- I'll take seafood jjajangmyeon. - Let's share.

890
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:41,150
- Respect, respect. - Respect.

891
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,280
Then I'll take japchae rice.

892
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,980
I'll take ganjjajang.

893
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:49,050
Then I'll take seafood jjajang.

894
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,119
I'll take plain jjajang.

895
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:52,190
- I'll take plain jjajangmyeon too. - I'll have ganjjajang.

896
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:54,030
Both of you chose plain jjajang.

897
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:56,630
(It's just a coincidence.)

898
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,630
Come on.

899
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,329
- I always take plain jjajang. - Stop it.

900
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:00,730
- That's what I always have. - Ulmyeon?

901
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,940
- Seafood jaengban jjamppong. - Seafood jjamppong.

902
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,969
- Seafood jjamppong? - Seafood jjamppong?

903
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:07,909
- Seafood jaengban jjamppong. - Seafood jaengban jjamppong.

904
00:36:07,909 --> 00:36:11,210
(They joke around with the dish names.)

905
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,210
Okay.

906
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:15,610
You know, we're being like the typical middle-aged men now.

907
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,119
- Gosh, it's so annoying to hear. - Too much like them.

908
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:19,820
It's so annoying to hear.

909
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,949
- Are you saying that we sound old? - No, we are just old.

910
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:23,590
Seafood Jjamppong.

911
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,590
(They're in their 40s and 50s.)

912
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,789
- Jjajangmyeon. - No.

913
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,530
Do any of you want to change your dish?

914
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,760
- No. - No.

915
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,760
- Never. - Never.

916
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,760
Let's just do it.

917
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,329
Such teamwork.

918
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:35,630
- Respect, respect, big respect. - Respect, respect, big respect.

919
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,070
Superman, Superman...

920
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,670
- Superman? - Superman?

921
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,869
That's mine.

922
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:42,110
Go with Wonder Woman.

923
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,639
Wonder, Wonder Woman.

924
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:45,039
(Laughing)

925
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:47,880
Seok Jin seems to want to join.

926
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:49,849
I shouldn't do it.

927
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:50,880
He can't speak fast.

928
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,050
Assistant, assistant, assistant.

929
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:56,190
- Respect, respect... - Stop it.

930
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,190
Gosh.

931
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,860
- That's you. - You got caught in the first round.

932
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,860
- Assistant, assistant, assistant... - You got caught in the first round.

933
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,590
You got caught right in the beginning.

934
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:04,059
(I'm not an assistant.)

935
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:05,659
- Assistant, assistant... - That's hilarious.

936
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,900
(Are we just getting the food we ordered?)

937
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:11,469
(They're waiting for their lunch.)

938
00:37:11,469 --> 00:37:13,469
The order has been made.

939
00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:15,269
While waiting for your food,

940
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:18,880
you'll play a game where the winner can watch...

941
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,679
- another hint video. - What's the game?

942
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,949
There are so many videos.

943
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:26,280
The game is dedicated to our hopeless romantic, Kwang Soo.

944
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:31,159
It's based on a survey of singles in their 20s and 30s.

945
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:33,389
Temperature of Love Questionnaire.

946
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:37,329
(Temperature of Love Questionnaire)

947
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:40,469
The survey consisted of popular questions on dating.

948
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:42,000
(They have to guess which option was chosen by the majority.)

949
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,070
That sounds fun.

950
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,300
It's a team competition.

951
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:49,239
It's Kwang Soo versus...

952
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:53,179
teams of 3 formed by Kwang Soo.

953
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:57,079
(Kwang Soo versus 3 teams of 3 people)

954
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:00,019
These two will be in different teams.

955
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:01,789
(You two can lead separate teams.)

956
00:38:01,889 --> 00:38:04,389
Please make sure every team has at least one female member.

957
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,519
Let me tell you...

958
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:08,659
how you choose your answer.

959
00:38:08,659 --> 00:38:11,000
(They'll be stacked on each other.)

960
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
When the whistle blows,

961
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,829
you'll be stacked on each other.

962
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:17,139
(They'll compete to be at their desired position in the stack.)

963
00:38:17,139 --> 00:38:19,300
The number of the option will dictate where you want to go.

964
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:22,510
The lowest layer becomes number 1, the highest number 4.

965
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,840
(The bottom layer becomes number 1, and the top layer number 4.)

966
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,650
Why aren't the assistants doing anything?

967
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,920
(It's so random.)

968
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,079
Are they doing something?

969
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:36,050
(Seok Jin)

970
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,219
(That's so random.)

971
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:42,130
You should have planned those words beforehand.

972
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:45,429
Seok Jin should have had a rehearsal.

973
00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:47,900
(If he turns out not to be an assistant, that'd be weird too.)

974
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,099
Why aren't the assistants doing anything?

975
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:51,440
Please do something.

976
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:55,210
(Seok Jin, please stop. I'll deal with it on my own.)

977
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,610
- Kwang Soo, please form the teams. - Okay.

978
00:38:57,909 --> 00:38:59,210
Is Kwang Soo going to decide?

979
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,909
Yes, he'll form the teams.

980
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,519
Team Red...

981
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:05,449
(Team Red)

982
00:39:05,449 --> 00:39:06,750
- It should be Jong Kook's team. - Okay.

983
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,949
- Me? - Yes,

984
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,389
Okay.

985
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:11,719
All members of the winning team will watch the video.

986
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:12,989
- Really? - Really?

987
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:14,489
- Yes. - Then it's important.

988
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:16,530
Give me one of those red vests.

989
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,730
(I want to be in the same team as Jong Kook.)

990
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,059
I'm so tired.

991
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:20,329
(Let me team up with Jong Kook.)

992
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:21,969
(Ignoring)

993
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:24,300
Give them to clumsy ones.

994
00:39:24,469 --> 00:39:25,800
One for you then.

995
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,940
(Give them to clumsy ones.)

996
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,309
(One for you then.)

997
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,610
(Embarrassed)

998
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,639
Nice.

999
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:34,780
- One for his assistant. - Lastly...

1000
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:36,920
So Min.

1001
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:39,079
She's clumsy too.

1002
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,389
On Jong Kook's team...

1003
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,090
They got caught by me in the last game.

1004
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:48,090
- They're both clumsy. - We're the clumsy ones.

1005
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,059
- They're the clumsy ones... - They're clumsy.

1006
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,760
Clumsy Jeon and Awkward Jee.

1007
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,199
- Team Clumsy. - Team Clumsy.

1008
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,530
Cross.

1009
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,039
(Clumsy Jeon and Awkward Jee)

1010
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:00,110
(Team Red: Jong Kook, Seok Jin, and So Min)

1011
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,170
(Team Green: Jae Seok, Sung Rok, and Ji Hyo)

1012
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:04,039
(Team White: Haha, Se Chan, and Bo Mi)

1013
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:05,980
This question is...

1014
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:07,880
for male members.

1015
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,679
Okay. Sung Rok will play for us.

1016
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:12,219
Please pick one male member.

1017
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:13,650
- Jong Kook. - Let's do this.

1018
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,090
(Haha is representing Team White.)

1019
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,690
If you think number three is the correct answer,

1020
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,719
you have to try to be the third layer.

1021
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,159
If you want to be the third layer,

1022
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,860
do you wait for two people to stack up...

1023
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,559
or do you stack them up yourself?

1024
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,000
- What do you do? - Do whatever you want.

1025
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,570
Can you do what you want?

1026
00:40:28,699 --> 00:40:30,300
I suddenly feel so tired.

1027
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,340
(I suddenly feel so tired.)

1028
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,170
- Respect, respect. - Respect.

1029
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,570
Respect, respect.

1030
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:37,880
Respect.

1031
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,179
We're so tired.

1032
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:43,579
Here goes question number one.

1033
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,380
Here we go.

1034
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,750
"You get a text from your crush late at night..."

1035
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,650
"asking if you're asleep. What would you do?"

1036
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,019
Number 1 is texting "No" right away.

1037
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:54,760
Number 2 is texting "I'm having a beer" after a moment.

1038
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:58,530
You'd do the first one, right? You'd text "No" right away.

1039
00:40:58,699 --> 00:40:59,960
Yes.

1040
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,369
I think...

1041
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:03,940
I think it's number 4.

1042
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:06,070
- I think it's number 1. - "I didn't see your message."

1043
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,869
Let's stick to our first choice, number 1.

1044
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:09,309
- It's either number 1 or 2. - Go with number 1.

1045
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:11,840
I think it's either number 1 or 2.

1046
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:14,050
It could be number 1.

1047
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,110
I'm sorry,

1048
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,420
but shouldn't you be thinking to yourself?

1049
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,489
(Shouldn't you be thinking to yourself?)

1050
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:22,650
I couldn't be standing here quietly.

1051
00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:23,860
Have you made up your mind?

1052
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,320
- Yes. - Please.

1053
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:28,889
Ready...

1054
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:29,929
(Stacking is more important.)

1055
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:30,929
(Stacking starts.)

1056
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:32,659
I think it's number 1.

1057
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,670
(Let me be the 1st layer.)

1058
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,670
It's number 1.

1059
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,739
(Excuse me.)

1060
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:42,170
Sung Rok is pushing in.

1061
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,210
- You want to be the 1st layer? - Yes.

1062
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:47,650
Can you lie on your back too?

1063
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,750
- There you go. - Number 2 can't be right.

1064
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:51,679
- You think so? - It can't be.

1065
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:53,119
Is it number 1?

1066
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:55,389
Sung Rok is the first layer now.

1067
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,460
- Sung Rok is the first layer. - Jong Kook!

1068
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,719
Sung Rok is the 1st layer.

1069
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,329
The correct answer might be number 4.

1070
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:03,659
- I can't wait. - Stop.

1071
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:05,099
I'm not sure.

1072
00:42:07,469 --> 00:42:08,769
The correct answer is...

1073
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:10,000
Which one is it?

1074
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,670
It was chosen by 40 percent of the respondents.

1075
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,099
Really?

1076
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:16,409
(It was chosen by 40 percent of the respondents.)

1077
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,710
(Is it number 1?)

1078
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,880
Number 1, texting "No" right away.

1079
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,579
(Team Green wins.)

1080
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:23,920
Number 1 was the simplest.

1081
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,019
Number 1.

1082
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,550
Number 2,

1083
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:29,190
"I'm having a beer" was chosen by 37 percent.

1084
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,260
I see.

1085
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:32,590
It was either number 1 or 2.

1086
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:35,090
I thought it'd be number 3.

1087
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:36,260
Me too.

1088
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,599
Number 3, "I was working",

1089
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:39,960
was chosen by the least people, 4 percent.

1090
00:42:40,469 --> 00:42:41,800
You're the worst kind of guy.

1091
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,400
(It was chosen by the least number of people.)

1092
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,739
The worst kind of guy.

1093
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,539
I've been getting advice from Jae Seok.

1094
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:48,710
That's why I'm still single.

1095
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,380
- We're in that 4 percent. - Yes.

1096
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,309
- We're in that 4 percent. - 4 percent.

1097
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,949
(They know nothing about dating.)

1098
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:57,650
What would you do, Bo Mi?

1099
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,349
- Number 2. - Why?

1100
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:03,119
I couldn't wait too long if he's my crush.

1101
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,489
You're leading him to say, "Can I join?"

1102
00:43:04,489 --> 00:43:06,190
- Exactly. - Number 2...

1103
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:10,400
What did you do when Kwang Soo video called you at night?

1104
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,159
(What about when Kwang Soo video called Bo Mi?)

1105
00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:16,570
(Kwang Soo, while drunk, woke Bo Mi up.)

1106
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:17,739
What did you do?

1107
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:20,769
(What did she do?)

1108
00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:23,940
I had to work.

1109
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,610
"I didn't see your message because I was working."

1110
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:27,980
That's great.

1111
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,880
You would have seen it late because of work too.

1112
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,880
- Yes. - Right.

1113
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,150
She's in that four percent too.

1114
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,519
Bo Mi is in that four percent.

1115
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:36,119
What about you, Sung Rok?

1116
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:38,289
If you just write, "No",

1117
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,829
the other person will have to say something.

1118
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:43,289
You're so smart.

1119
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,630
Then afterwards, I could suggest having a beer together...

1120
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:47,869
- or say I was working. - You'd just write, "No."

1121
00:43:47,869 --> 00:43:48,900
Yes.

1122
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,000
He's so smart.

1123
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,969
He's a dating expert.

1124
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,309
- Jong Kook, what about you? - I'd write, "No."

1125
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,880
When I have a crush on someone,

1126
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,449
I like to tease her.

1127
00:44:00,449 --> 00:44:01,980
So...

1128
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,920
Because you're shy?

1129
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,219
Yes. If she asks me what I'm doing,

1130
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:10,320
I'd say, "Everything except thinking about you".

1131
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:12,860
As a joke.

1132
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:19,000
(Everything except thinking about you?)

1133
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,829
- What? - Jong Kook.

1134
00:44:20,829 --> 00:44:21,829
(Screaming)

1135
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:22,969
- Calm down. - What's with you?

1136
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:24,340
Let me explain.

1137
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,340
It's not like that.

1138
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,170
I hate it.

1139
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:29,809
Bo Mi hates guys who do that.

1140
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:33,179
- It's just an example. - Hey!

1141
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:35,510
You hate it, right? She hates it.

1142
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:38,219
Let's say Jong Kook wrote, "Everything..."

1143
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:40,849
- I don't actually do that. - "except thinking about you."

1144
00:44:41,289 --> 00:44:43,250
What would you write back?

1145
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,219
- I wouldn't write anything. - She'd ignore it.

1146
00:44:46,219 --> 00:44:47,530
(I wouldn't write anything.)

1147
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:48,690
(She'd ignore it.)

1148
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,300
She'd ignore it.

1149
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,260
- She'd ignore it. - Please ask me.

1150
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:54,070
What about you, So Min?

1151
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:55,369
"Why are you not thinking about me?"

1152
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,070
- There you go. - She took the bait.

1153
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,869
Sometimes, the girl takes the bait.

1154
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:01,010
I would.

1155
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:04,409
Let's say the girl wrote that...

1156
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:06,280
- to me. - What should I say?

1157
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:08,980
"Why are you not thinking about me?"

1158
00:45:09,909 --> 00:45:11,119
"If I do, I won't be able to sleep."

1159
00:45:12,619 --> 00:45:14,489
(So Min falls again.)

1160
00:45:14,489 --> 00:45:15,750
Then what would you say?

1161
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:19,320
(What are they doing?)

1162
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,090
Jong Kook, Bo Mi is still ignoring your messages.

1163
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:24,599
She's still ignoring them.

1164
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:25,730
At least one girl took the bait.

1165
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,130
So Min loves these things.

1166
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,530
- She loves it. - She does.

1167
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,530
(What would So Min write back?)

1168
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,840
"Why wouldn't you be able to sleep?"

1169
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,670
- "Because you'd miss me too much?" - Cut it out.

1170
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,809
(Because you'd miss me too much?)

1171
00:45:35,809 --> 00:45:37,909
(Cut it out.)

1172
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:39,039
Respect.

1173
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:41,210
- I can't stand it. - Be quiet.

1174
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:43,210
- I've had enough. - Be quiet.

1175
00:45:44,019 --> 00:45:46,119
- I don't actually do this. - So Min looks so happy.

1176
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:48,050
What would you write back?

1177
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:51,420
I just say it as a joke.

1178
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:54,289
I can't believe I've been getting advice from those two.

1179
00:45:54,289 --> 00:45:56,460
I'm experienced.

1180
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,929
Male members will play again.

1181
00:45:58,929 --> 00:46:00,170
I'll go this time.

1182
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,400
- Those who haven't played... - It's weak ones this time.

1183
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,699
You should...

1184
00:46:03,699 --> 00:46:04,940
Let's do this.

1185
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,840
- You should wait. - You're right.

1186
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,170
- I have a chance this time. - You shouldn't lie down too fast.

1187
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:14,150
The next question was answered by men in their 20s and 30s.

1188
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:16,179
- Men? - Only men?

1189
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:17,480
Then I have an advantage.

1190
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:20,320
Here goes the question.

1191
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,650
Let's do this.

1192
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:24,090
"Your girlfriend asks how many girls you have dated. What's your answer?"

1193
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,989
Number 1, "Tell her how many girls you have dated."

1194
00:46:25,989 --> 00:46:27,760
Number 2, "Ask her the same question."

1195
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:30,900
Number 3, "Ask her what counts as a girlfriend."

1196
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,400
Number 4, "Of course you are my first and last love."

1197
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,300
- Number d4. - Of course it's number 4.

1198
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,440
"Of course you are my first and last love."

1199
00:46:37,469 --> 00:46:39,599
For me, it's number 1. I reveal everything.

1200
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:41,039
- Why would you do that? - I reveal everything.

1201
00:46:41,309 --> 00:46:42,969
I think it's number 4.

1202
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:44,679
- It's number 4. - It's number 4.

1203
00:46:44,679 --> 00:46:45,679
Number 4 is too romantic.

1204
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:48,079
No one wants number 2, right? I will choose number 2.

1205
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:50,380
- Get ready. - Get down on the floor.

1206
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:51,650
- Don't tell me what to do. - Set.

1207
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:52,820
(The stacking begins.)

1208
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,889
No, no.

1209
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,449
Let's put him on the bottom. He is strong.

1210
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,360
- Let's do that. - Let's do that.

1211
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,389
- Go to the bottom. - I will get away.

1212
00:46:59,389 --> 00:47:00,590
Come on.

1213
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:03,190
Wait a minute.

1214
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,130
(He strikes back with his sharp chin.)

1215
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:07,869
This is getting dirty.

1216
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:09,570
Hey, hey.

1217
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,539
My goodness, wait a minute.

1218
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,909
I don't want to choose number 3.

1219
00:47:13,909 --> 00:47:14,909
(The stacking ends.)

1220
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:16,239
I don't want to choose number 3.

1221
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:19,710
- Number 2. - Number 4.

1222
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:21,880
- The answer is... - Number 4.

1223
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,480
(Everyone in the winning team gets to watch a hint video.)

1224
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,650
Number 4 is too cheesy.

1225
00:47:26,989 --> 00:47:28,920
- The answer is... - Number 4 is too cheesy.

1226
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,090
number 1.

1227
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:33,389
(Team White wins.)

1228
00:47:33,389 --> 00:47:38,030
- Respect, respect. - Respect, respect.

1229
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:40,400
- Really? - I would tell my girlfriend.

1230
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,230
That's what people do these days.

1231
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:46,070
I thought the answer would be...

1232
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:47,639
either number 1 or 4.

1233
00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:49,940
Then I thought a girlfriend might get upset...

1234
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,710
- by number 1. - Number 4 is the best.

1235
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:56,280
Bo Mi, in a woman's point of view, which option is the best?

1236
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:59,079
I like either number 1 or 2.

1237
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:00,989
- It's not number 4. - Women don't like number 4.

1238
00:48:00,989 --> 00:48:02,920
Do you prefer hearing, "Right back at you"?

1239
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:04,489
I wouldn't like it if he says, "Right back at you."

1240
00:48:04,489 --> 00:48:06,190
"How many boys have you dated?"

1241
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:07,730
- Is that better? - He could ask me that.

1242
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:10,059
It's better to ask playfully. "How many boys have you dated?"

1243
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:11,829
It's another way of saying, "The past isn't important."

1244
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:14,130
- That's right. - You are a loving man.

1245
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,070
- You are a loving man. - What about you, So Min?

1246
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:17,969
- I like number 4. - Of course you do.

1247
00:48:17,969 --> 00:48:19,300
They say ignorance is bliss.

1248
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,840
I wouldn't want to keep thinking about my boyfriend's past.

1249
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,440
That's why it's better to reveal everything.

1250
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,010
Why don't you ask the question to Jong Kook?

1251
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,650
Jong Kook says he will tell all. Act out the situation.

1252
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:32,079
How many girls have you dated?

1253
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,519
Do I need to reveal it here?

1254
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:35,889
(I am on a shoot.)

1255
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:37,960
- There are a lot of cameras. - Tell us.

1256
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,090
This is Truth or Dare.

1257
00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:42,190
Even though there are cameras, imagine that we are by ourselves.

1258
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:43,929
- You have dated a lot of women. - That's a lot.

1259
00:48:43,929 --> 00:48:47,500
Which one did you love the most? Rank them from top 1 to 8.

1260
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,440
(Which one did you love the most? Rank them from top 1 to 8.)

1261
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,440
The woman I broke up with the most recently is the one...

1262
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,809
- I loved the most. - The most recent one?

1263
00:48:54,809 --> 00:48:56,739
- How do I rank? - You?

1264
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,840
It hasn't been long since we met. I don't love you.

1265
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:00,849
Are you sure this is better?

1266
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:02,650
- Is this better? - Is this better?

1267
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:04,750
Is this really better?

1268
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,380
- This is how the conversation goes. - Then why are you dating me?

1269
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,949
It's too early to talk about love.

1270
00:49:07,949 --> 00:49:10,690
Will you give me a place only after you break up with me?

1271
00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:12,889
So Min got him.

1272
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:15,360
- So Min is hard to beat. - That's right.

1273
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:17,099
You will be top one when we get married.

1274
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:20,000
You can't ensure that we will get married.

1275
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:22,070
Isn't this the end of their schedule?

1276
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:23,900
That kind of a situation means...

1277
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,699
(Isn't this the end of their schedule?)

1278
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:27,369
- That kind of a situation means... - They would get annoyed.

1279
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:28,739
the end of their schedule for the day.

1280
00:49:28,909 --> 00:49:29,940
Listen.

1281
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,239
They would have to stop the car.

1282
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:34,809
- They would have to stop the car. - They would have to do that.

1283
00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:36,010
(There is a 100 percent chance the couple would stop the car.)

1284
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:39,150
You didn't marry your previous girlfriends.

1285
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,619
- I didn't love them enough. - You might not marry me.

1286
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,019
Ask her how many men she has dated.

1287
00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:44,019
Stay out of it.

1288
00:49:44,019 --> 00:49:47,030
(This is getting interesting.)

1289
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:48,230
What do you think you are doing?

1290
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:50,300
- Who are you? - What do you think you are doing?

1291
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,659
Go on your way.

1292
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,699
This is the highlight.

1293
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,099
For goodness' sake. What do you think you are doing?

1294
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,510
We were at the most important part.

1295
00:50:01,139 --> 00:50:02,809
Sung Rok, what would be your choice?

1296
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:04,179
My choice would be number 4.

1297
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,610
- Right? - That's right.

1298
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:08,550
I have an idea. Ji Hyo doesn't like number 4.

1299
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:10,519
She likes it when men are honest. Please act out the situation.

1300
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:11,650
- Give it a go. - All right.

1301
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,519
Ji Hyo, ask him the question.

1302
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:15,889
Sung Rok, how many women have you dated?

1303
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:17,559
- Me? - Yes.

1304
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:18,920
You are the first one.

1305
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:21,530
Don't lie.

1306
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:24,630
(Slapping)

1307
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:27,800
- Ji Hyo. - She looked him up and down.

1308
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,170
- Ji Hyo. - The thing is,

1309
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:32,469
he didn't look confident when he said that.

1310
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:37,010
(Despite the perfect line, his eyes couldn't hide the truth.)

1311
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,940
(Shifting)

1312
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:41,280
Ji Hyo is a professional.

1313
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:43,050
Ji Hyo is a professional.

1314
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:45,019
This time,

1315
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,389
the ones with the same style will act out a situation.

1316
00:50:47,449 --> 00:50:49,019
Why don't Sung Rok and So Min give it a go?

1317
00:50:49,019 --> 00:50:50,789
Both of you chose the same answer.

1318
00:50:50,789 --> 00:50:52,389
- Give it a go. - Okay.

1319
00:50:52,389 --> 00:50:54,460
It's not a bad answer if you love the woman very much.

1320
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,000
How many women have you dated?

1321
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,159
Me? You are the first one.

1322
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,000
- Am I really the first one? - Yes.

1323
00:51:01,429 --> 00:51:03,369
Then why are you such a good kisser?

1324
00:51:03,369 --> 00:51:07,239
(Then why are you such a good kisser?)

1325
00:51:07,239 --> 00:51:08,940
She began to investigate.

1326
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,579
There are women who begin to investigate.

1327
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:12,639
- I mean... - What do you think you are doing?

1328
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:14,280
Why did you ask him that?

1329
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,780
- She is ridiculous. - This is crazy.

1330
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:17,579
What do you think you are doing?

1331
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:18,750
Seriously.

1332
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:19,949
Are you an investigator?

1333
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:21,849
Are you an investigator?

1334
00:51:21,989 --> 00:51:25,219
She is like a prosecutor.

1335
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,989
Are you a prosecutor?

1336
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,659
What is wrong with her?

1337
00:51:28,659 --> 00:51:32,400
I want Jae Seok and So Min to give it a go.

1338
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,900
- Me? - He always says he is an expert.

1339
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:37,369
He always gives advice to Kwang Soo.

1340
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:39,869
As everyone knows, I am Kwang Soo's relationship coach.

1341
00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:42,710
To be honest, this happened once.

1342
00:51:42,909 --> 00:51:44,980
There was a time a woman dated my body...

1343
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,809
and Jae Seok's mind.

1344
00:51:46,809 --> 00:51:49,210
(This is an experience I had.)

1345
00:51:49,409 --> 00:51:50,780
Were you okay with that?

1346
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,719
- He is my relationship coach. - I coach him...

1347
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,519
with precision.

1348
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:56,550
I point out the important parts. Let's go, So Min.

1349
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:57,719
Here comes the prosecutor.

1350
00:51:57,719 --> 00:51:58,920
(The expert of interrogation)

1351
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,059
- Okay. - She is an investigator.

1352
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:01,559
(The relationship prosecutor, So Min)

1353
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,960
Here comes the prosecutor.

1354
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,000
(Interesting)

1355
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,559
She is a prosecutor. She is an investigator.

1356
00:52:05,929 --> 00:52:07,670
I am not an easy target.

1357
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:11,539
(The fierce melodrama unfolds.)

1358
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:13,239
- I am not an easy target. - Jae Seok.

1359
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:15,940
Have many women have you dated?

1360
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,380
My goodness.

1361
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,579
- Don't you know what I am like? - No.

1362
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:22,579
You are my first and last love.

1363
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,579
How is that possible? You are very old.

1364
00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:26,889
I need to focus on the road.

1365
00:52:26,889 --> 00:52:29,050
(Let's have a conversation later.)

1366
00:52:29,289 --> 00:52:31,820
- What was that? - Jae Seok.

1367
00:52:31,989 --> 00:52:33,789
Are you in Japan? Why are you on the right side?

1368
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:35,760
Why are you on the right side?

1369
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,300
Did you go to Japan?

1370
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,730
- You are on the right side. - Right now,

1371
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,070
- we are in Okinawa. - Okinawa.

1372
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:43,840
- We are in Okinawa. - Okay.

1373
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:47,769
Am I the first woman who came here with you?

1374
00:52:47,769 --> 00:52:49,639
(She begins her investigation.)

1375
00:52:49,639 --> 00:52:51,179
(The relationship expert seems to be flustered.)

1376
00:52:51,179 --> 00:52:52,510
I can't stop laughing.

1377
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:55,510
- I am the first woman, right? - I can't stop laughing.

1378
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:57,050
(The relationship expert seems to be flustered.)

1379
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:58,820
Wait a minute.

1380
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:02,690
(Prosecutor, wait a minute.)

1381
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:03,719
Hey.

1382
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:06,289
- Did you swear at your girlfriend? - It means "Wait a minute."

1383
00:53:06,289 --> 00:53:08,159
- Since I am in Japan, - That's right.

1384
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:12,429
- I am learning Japanese. - Okay.

1385
00:53:12,429 --> 00:53:13,530
You know this, right?

1386
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:15,929
I don't share my heart with another easily.

1387
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:18,099
- Not even in elementary school? - Of course I didn't.

1388
00:53:18,099 --> 00:53:20,139
- What about in middle school? - I had a few blind dates.

1389
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:21,940
Look at his face. Of course he didn't.

1390
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:25,280
(Look at his face. Of course he didn't.)

1391
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,510
Look at your boyfriend's face.

1392
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,480
It doesn't make sense that you don't believe him.

1393
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,980
Believe him.

1394
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,320
- Don't you feel bad for him? - Look at his face.

1395
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,960
- Look at his face. - Do you really think he is lying?

1396
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,059
For goodness' sake.

1397
00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:40,360
- You should believe him. - This is driving me crazy.

1398
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,289
- Look at his face. - This is driving me crazy.

1399
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:44,829
A lot of people are cool.

1400
00:53:44,829 --> 00:53:46,230
These days,

1401
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:48,869
it's better to be confident and cool.

1402
00:53:49,829 --> 00:53:52,170
Your answer should match the atmosphere and situation.

1403
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,769
There is no right answer.

1404
00:53:53,769 --> 00:53:56,210
- There is no right answer in love. - Talking about first love...

1405
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:57,280
Write it down.

1406
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,179
Write it down. "There is no right answer in love."

1407
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:02,679
- It's nothing impressive. - Remember my words.

1408
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:04,550
This is Yu Jae Seok's relationship notebook.

1409
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:07,019
"There is no right answer in love."

1410
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:12,920
(Women answer the third question.)

1411
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:15,059
(The stacking involves dirty moves such as a low kick and dragging.)

1412
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:16,460
It's over.

1413
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:18,559
The answer is number 4.

1414
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,599
(Team Green wins Temperature of Love Questionnaire.)

1415
00:54:23,369 --> 00:54:24,969
The three members of Team Green, please come forward.

1416
00:54:24,969 --> 00:54:26,300
(Jae Seok, Ji Hyo, and Sung Rok have the chance to watch the hint video.)

1417
00:54:26,909 --> 00:54:28,539
They will watch the video at the same time.

1418
00:54:30,739 --> 00:54:35,380
(What kind of a hint does the video contain?)

1419
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:39,619
Aren't you hungry? Shall we order something?

1420
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:43,050
It's already late. What shall we eat?

1421
00:54:43,289 --> 00:54:45,360
- Shall we eat jjajangmyeon? - My choice is jjajangmyeon too.

1422
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:47,460
What would you like?

1423
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,159
I like jjajangmyeon too.

1424
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:52,030
Please order jjajangmyeon and jaengban jjajangmyeon.

1425
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:53,969
(Everyone likes jjajangmyeon.)

1426
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,329
This is...

1427
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,670
This is very telling.

1428
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:59,300
(What?)

1429
00:54:59,869 --> 00:55:01,510
(Before they played a game, they ordered food together.)

1430
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:06,340
(Se Chan ordered jjajangmyeon to share with So Min.)

1431
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:12,480
(Sung Rok, Bo Mi, and Seok Jin also ordered jjajangmyeon.)

1432
00:55:12,949 --> 00:55:16,349
(Are the assistants among these four members?)

1433
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:17,920
This is very telling.

1434
00:55:18,289 --> 00:55:19,619
Isn't this too telling?

1435
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:20,889
This is very telling.

1436
00:55:21,159 --> 00:55:23,030
- It must be a helpful hint. - Did you watch the video?

1437
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:24,559
(Why are they so surprised?)

1438
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:26,230
Okay.

1439
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:29,369
(Let's see if they succeed in apprehending the assistants.)

1440
00:55:30,004 --> 00:55:31,075
(Final Mission)

1441
00:55:31,075 --> 00:55:34,314
The final mission in the Half and Half Tour Pass Race...

1442
00:55:34,484 --> 00:55:36,084
is called Death Signal.

1443
00:55:36,084 --> 00:55:39,354
(Death Signal)

1444
00:55:40,325 --> 00:55:45,095
USB sticks with hint videos in them are hidden in this building.

1445
00:55:45,394 --> 00:55:46,865
- USB sticks? - Hint videos?

1446
00:55:47,024 --> 00:55:50,334
You have to guess who the assistants are...

1447
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:54,564
and report using 1 of the 2 hidden walkie-talkies.

1448
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:57,075
You're given only one chance to report,

1449
00:55:57,434 --> 00:56:00,305
and the race will end when the assistants are arrested.

1450
00:56:00,305 --> 00:56:01,604
(That means Kwang Soo and his assistants have lost.)

1451
00:56:01,604 --> 00:56:03,914
When your report turns out to be false,

1452
00:56:03,914 --> 00:56:07,785
you will be eliminated immediately. So be careful when you do.

1453
00:56:08,414 --> 00:56:12,515
One of the assistants is here. We don't have to do all that.

1454
00:56:12,515 --> 00:56:15,124
(This is really the last stage.)

1455
00:56:15,124 --> 00:56:19,254
Assistants can eliminate others by removing their name tags.

1456
00:56:19,254 --> 00:56:21,024
- Pardon? - Only the assistants...

1457
00:56:21,024 --> 00:56:23,095
can do that.

1458
00:56:23,095 --> 00:56:24,365
- We have to run. - Really?

1459
00:56:24,394 --> 00:56:27,004
If everyone is eliminated before the assistants are arrested,

1460
00:56:27,004 --> 00:56:28,865
Kwang Soo will win the right...

1461
00:56:29,004 --> 00:56:31,434
to choose two people to follow him to Australia.

1462
00:56:31,434 --> 00:56:32,434
(Kwang Soo can bring 2 more people.)

1463
00:56:32,434 --> 00:56:33,504
That's big.

1464
00:56:33,504 --> 00:56:35,745
(Kwang Soo can bring 2 more people.)

1465
00:56:36,175 --> 00:56:38,874
If the assistants are arrested,

1466
00:56:39,475 --> 00:56:43,184
the surviving members will not be going to Australia.

1467
00:56:43,385 --> 00:56:46,454
Two of the eliminated members will be going.

1468
00:56:46,454 --> 00:56:48,655
All the surviving members will be excluded?

1469
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:49,655
Yes.

1470
00:56:49,655 --> 00:56:52,555
(Then the assistants should do a good job.)

1471
00:56:52,555 --> 00:56:54,825
(Restless)

1472
00:56:55,265 --> 00:56:58,035
(Look at Seok Jin.)

1473
00:57:00,095 --> 00:57:04,575
Seok Jin must have lost focus at some point.

1474
00:57:04,575 --> 00:57:06,175
- Why? - He probably gave up.

1475
00:57:06,405 --> 00:57:08,945
He suddenly started to do this.

1476
00:57:09,345 --> 00:57:12,745
And he started practicing with Bo Mi's name tag.

1477
00:57:12,874 --> 00:57:14,314
- Don't say that. - Stop it.

1478
00:57:14,314 --> 00:57:15,385
Don't say that.

1479
00:57:15,385 --> 00:57:18,184
- It's so obvious. - Stop it.

1480
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,325
- You're so mean. - Think whatever you want.

1481
00:57:20,425 --> 00:57:22,754
Think whatever you want, but don't forget.

1482
00:57:22,754 --> 00:57:24,524
You'll be paying for it.

1483
00:57:24,555 --> 00:57:28,825
Please go to your positions so we can start the race.

1484
00:57:28,825 --> 00:57:29,995
- Okay. - Let's go.

1485
00:57:29,995 --> 00:57:33,164
(They move to their starting positions.)

1486
00:57:35,064 --> 00:57:36,734
We can only report using the walkie-talkies,

1487
00:57:37,405 --> 00:57:38,874
and only assistants can remove name tags?

1488
00:57:38,874 --> 00:57:40,305
(Sung Rok is still trying to understand the rules.)

1489
00:57:40,845 --> 00:57:42,774
Haha, who do you think...

1490
00:57:43,515 --> 00:57:45,475
are assistants?

1491
00:57:45,874 --> 00:57:48,715
- Hey. - I know too, but...

1492
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,655
My guess is Sung Rok...

1493
00:57:51,655 --> 00:57:53,584
and Seok Jin.

1494
00:57:54,425 --> 00:57:55,425
- Really? - Yes.

1495
00:57:55,885 --> 00:57:56,925
Where are you going?

1496
00:57:57,555 --> 00:57:58,825
- Where are you going? - Seok Jin.

1497
00:57:58,825 --> 00:58:01,095
You'll be here? Okay.

1498
00:58:01,294 --> 00:58:02,394
I'll come back to get you.

1499
00:58:02,894 --> 00:58:04,535
I'll remove your name tag.

1500
00:58:04,535 --> 00:58:06,135
(What?)

1501
00:58:06,135 --> 00:58:07,905
(Remove his name tag?)

1502
00:58:07,905 --> 00:58:09,834
Only assistants can remove name tags.

1503
00:58:09,834 --> 00:58:11,604
Are you saying you're an assistant?

1504
00:58:11,635 --> 00:58:13,075
I'm just saying.

1505
00:58:13,874 --> 00:58:16,704
(Is he really an assistant who is just a bit clumsy?)

1506
00:58:17,374 --> 00:58:20,745
I'm sure Seok Jin and Se Chan are assistants.

1507
00:58:21,484 --> 00:58:22,885
Yes, Se Chan.

1508
00:58:24,115 --> 00:58:27,325
The way he spoke in that video was too obvious.

1509
00:58:27,325 --> 00:58:29,124
I'm sure.

1510
00:58:29,124 --> 00:58:33,024
(Although the voice was disguised,)

1511
00:58:33,024 --> 00:58:37,035
(judging from the way he spoke, was it Se Chan?)

1512
00:58:38,135 --> 00:58:40,265
Se Chan usually speaks that way.

1513
00:58:40,834 --> 00:58:42,635
He speaks quite fast.

1514
00:58:45,035 --> 00:58:46,305
What will Seok Jin do?

1515
00:58:47,504 --> 00:58:48,504
I feel so sorry for him.

1516
00:58:50,175 --> 00:58:52,575
Dear assistants,

1517
00:58:55,285 --> 00:58:56,814
you must love jjajangmyeon.

1518
00:58:56,814 --> 00:58:58,015
(She means something by it.)

1519
00:58:59,215 --> 00:59:00,825
I think I know who you are.

1520
00:59:02,024 --> 00:59:04,624
Seok Jin and Bo Mi.

1521
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:05,754
(Her guess)

1522
00:59:05,754 --> 00:59:08,894
(Assistants love jjajangmyeon.)

1523
00:59:08,894 --> 00:59:10,635
(Who are...)

1524
00:59:10,635 --> 00:59:12,734
(Kwang Soo's assistants?)

1525
00:59:13,465 --> 00:59:15,465
The race will start soon. 10,

1526
00:59:16,265 --> 00:59:18,434
- 9, 8... - I'm bad at finding things.

1527
00:59:18,434 --> 00:59:19,504
(They have to report assistants.)

1528
00:59:19,504 --> 00:59:20,704
7, 6...

1529
00:59:20,704 --> 00:59:24,914
(If they report the wrong person, they'll be eliminated.)

1530
00:59:24,945 --> 00:59:27,914
(Who will survive to the end?)

1531
00:59:28,215 --> 00:59:29,215
The race starts now.

1532
00:59:29,715 --> 00:59:30,715
Here we go.

1533
00:59:32,215 --> 00:59:33,314
The race starts now.

1534
00:59:33,314 --> 00:59:35,454
(The race starts.)

1535
00:59:36,725 --> 00:59:40,294
I have to find USB sticks first.

1536
00:59:40,624 --> 00:59:41,825
(They have to find out who the assistants are.)

1537
00:59:41,825 --> 00:59:43,865
There might be one around here.

1538
00:59:44,595 --> 00:59:47,265
(Nervous)

1539
00:59:50,135 --> 00:59:51,135
Gosh, I'm scared.

1540
00:59:53,004 --> 00:59:55,874
(She usually gets eliminated this way.)

1541
00:59:57,874 --> 01:00:00,914
(If I can find USB sticks...)

1542
01:00:05,414 --> 01:00:07,684
(Kwang Soo is following him.)

1543
01:00:08,825 --> 01:00:11,624
(Kwang Soo suddenly...)

1544
01:00:11,624 --> 01:00:13,624
(runs to him.)

1545
01:00:13,624 --> 01:00:14,695
(Approaching)

1546
01:00:17,234 --> 01:00:18,234
Gosh.

1547
01:00:20,035 --> 01:00:22,765
(What is he doing?)

1548
01:00:22,765 --> 01:00:24,434
What are you doing?

1549
01:00:24,575 --> 01:00:26,774
- I'm just wandering around. - Kwang Soo.

1550
01:00:28,104 --> 01:00:29,874
All right. Anyway...

1551
01:00:30,004 --> 01:00:31,215
Kwang Soo. What are you doing?

1552
01:00:31,814 --> 01:00:32,814
What's going on?

1553
01:00:32,814 --> 01:00:34,385
(You two look suspicious.)

1554
01:00:34,385 --> 01:00:35,515
(Kwang Soo disappears.)

1555
01:00:35,515 --> 01:00:37,615
Hey.

1556
01:00:38,115 --> 01:00:41,124
He's just trying to make me look suspicious.

1557
01:00:41,854 --> 01:00:44,555
Gosh, I can't believe Kwang Soo.

1558
01:00:44,555 --> 01:00:45,754
Come here.

1559
01:00:46,354 --> 01:00:48,865
(So Min searches the convenience store.)

1560
01:00:49,664 --> 01:00:51,965
Hello. Have you seen USB sticks?

1561
01:00:52,394 --> 01:00:54,664
- No. - Didn't anyone hide anything here?

1562
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:55,734
No.

1563
01:00:55,734 --> 01:00:56,905
Didn't anyone come here?

1564
01:00:56,905 --> 01:00:59,035
No. We don't carry USB sticks.

1565
01:00:59,035 --> 01:01:01,345
Didn't anyone leave any boxes here?

1566
01:01:02,204 --> 01:01:03,245
No.

1567
01:01:03,814 --> 01:01:06,515
(There must be one here.)

1568
01:01:09,684 --> 01:01:11,515
Unbelievable.

1569
01:01:12,115 --> 01:01:15,725
(So Min finds hint number 1.)

1570
01:01:15,725 --> 01:01:19,354
(Each USB stick has a different hint.)

1571
01:01:19,995 --> 01:01:22,995
(Careful)

1572
01:01:25,535 --> 01:01:26,535
It's playing.

1573
01:01:27,635 --> 01:01:30,035
- Should we order something? - What about jjajangmyeon?

1574
01:01:30,035 --> 01:01:32,675
- I want jjajangmyeon too. - Me too.

1575
01:01:32,905 --> 01:01:35,445
Jjajangmyeon and jaengban jjajangmyeon, please.

1576
01:01:36,104 --> 01:01:39,644
(So Min now knows the assistants like jjajangmyeon.)

1577
01:01:39,914 --> 01:01:42,484
Some of us ordered jjajangmyeon today.

1578
01:01:44,254 --> 01:01:47,484
(In addition to Se Chan and Seok Jin,)

1579
01:01:47,484 --> 01:01:51,095
(Sung Rok, Kwang Soo, and Bo Mi had jjajangmyeon.)

1580
01:01:51,655 --> 01:01:53,294
(This is very helpful.)

1581
01:01:53,294 --> 01:01:55,495
- Some people ordered jjajangmyeon. - So Min.

1582
01:01:56,834 --> 01:01:59,635
- Hey. - Did you watch a hint video?

1583
01:01:59,635 --> 01:02:00,635
No.

1584
01:02:00,635 --> 01:02:01,704
(She didn't even hesitate.)

1585
01:02:02,204 --> 01:02:05,075
I saw you taking off the earphones.

1586
01:02:05,234 --> 01:02:07,675
You lie all the time.

1587
01:02:07,805 --> 01:02:09,374
You're scary.

1588
01:02:09,374 --> 01:02:10,675
- That's not true. - Forget it.

1589
01:02:11,414 --> 01:02:13,044
Ji Hyo, I'll tell you something.

1590
01:02:13,484 --> 01:02:16,015
Who likes jjajangmyeon?

1591
01:02:18,454 --> 01:02:20,225
Jae Seok? Se Chan?

1592
01:02:20,624 --> 01:02:22,725
Se Chan said, "I'll definitely order a jjajangmyeon."

1593
01:02:22,725 --> 01:02:23,925
(I'm sure it's Se Chan.)

1594
01:02:23,925 --> 01:02:24,925
It's Se Chan.

1595
01:02:25,024 --> 01:02:27,524
Who ordered jjajangmyeon except Se Chan and Seok Jin?

1596
01:02:27,925 --> 01:02:28,925
Who were they?

1597
01:02:28,925 --> 01:02:29,925
(Se Chan and Seok Jin are suspicious.)

1598
01:02:30,934 --> 01:02:32,434
(Meanwhile...)

1599
01:02:32,434 --> 01:02:33,504
Bo Mi.

1600
01:02:35,035 --> 01:02:36,765
Hi.

1601
01:02:36,765 --> 01:02:40,644
(Se Chan, Bo Mi, and Seok Jin run into each other.)

1602
01:02:40,644 --> 01:02:42,405
(They all had jjajangmyeon.)

1603
01:02:42,405 --> 01:02:44,075
Is that Se Chan? Se Chan.

1604
01:02:44,175 --> 01:02:46,345
Yes? It's Seok Jin.

1605
01:02:47,015 --> 01:02:49,215
It's Seok Jin. Run.

1606
01:02:50,184 --> 01:02:51,814
(Running)

1607
01:02:53,015 --> 01:02:54,285
(Hurrying)

1608
01:02:54,285 --> 01:02:55,524
It's Seok Jin.

1609
01:02:55,524 --> 01:02:56,524
(Is he gone?)

1610
01:02:58,524 --> 01:02:59,624
(Sneaking)

1611
01:03:03,934 --> 01:03:07,164
(She found a USB stick.)

1612
01:03:10,004 --> 01:03:11,774
Unbelievable.

1613
01:03:13,334 --> 01:03:16,204
(She finds a laptop too.)

1614
01:03:16,204 --> 01:03:17,215
I can do this.

1615
01:03:17,215 --> 01:03:18,814
(She finds a laptop too.)

1616
01:03:20,015 --> 01:03:21,015
Finally, I get to watch it.

1617
01:03:21,615 --> 01:03:23,885
Jjajangmyeon and jaengban jjajangmyeon, please.

1618
01:03:24,814 --> 01:03:27,524
(The hint is jjajangmyeon?)

1619
01:03:27,524 --> 01:03:29,584
(Noise)

1620
01:03:31,524 --> 01:03:33,495
(Someone is coming.)

1621
01:03:35,024 --> 01:03:36,225
Someone watched a video here.

1622
01:03:38,894 --> 01:03:39,965
Unbelievable.

1623
01:03:42,504 --> 01:03:43,504
Wait.

1624
01:03:43,504 --> 01:03:45,604
(Who is coming?)

1625
01:03:48,274 --> 01:03:49,274
Who is it?

1626
01:03:51,075 --> 01:03:53,745
(The sound is getting near.)

1627
01:03:53,745 --> 01:03:57,015
(Who is chasing Bo Mi?)

1628
01:03:57,285 --> 01:04:00,285
(An assistant?)

1629
01:04:01,555 --> 01:04:03,725
Please lock the door.

1630
01:04:04,394 --> 01:04:06,725
They like jjajangmyeon.

1631
01:04:06,725 --> 01:04:08,225
(Hold on)

1632
01:04:08,225 --> 01:04:10,124
Unbelievable. They like jjajangmyeon.

1633
01:04:10,124 --> 01:04:11,234
Who ordered jjajangmyeon?

1634
01:04:13,434 --> 01:04:14,905
Se Chan and Seok Jin...

1635
01:04:16,104 --> 01:04:17,135
It must be them.

1636
01:04:19,004 --> 01:04:23,374
(Se Chan and Seok Jin had jjajangmyeon.)

1637
01:04:23,975 --> 01:04:28,015
(Se Chan?)

1638
01:04:28,015 --> 01:04:30,885
(Seok Jin?)

1639
01:04:34,484 --> 01:04:36,354
(Peeking)

1640
01:04:37,555 --> 01:04:41,064
(Someone is approaching.)

1641
01:04:43,765 --> 01:04:45,064
(Rattling)

1642
01:04:46,195 --> 01:04:48,834
(Come on, Bo Mi.)

1643
01:04:55,445 --> 01:04:57,075
(Wait)

1644
01:04:57,075 --> 01:04:58,445
(Kwang Soo?)

1645
01:05:00,015 --> 01:05:01,015
(It's me.)

1646
01:05:01,015 --> 01:05:02,845
Hold on.

1647
01:05:02,845 --> 01:05:04,615
Kwang Soo,

1648
01:05:04,754 --> 01:05:05,914
hold on.

1649
01:05:05,914 --> 01:05:07,854
You can't rip my name tag off.

1650
01:05:07,854 --> 01:05:11,195
- You can't, right? - I can't.

1651
01:05:11,195 --> 01:05:14,425
(Only the assistants can rip it off.)

1652
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:19,294
(There's a dark shadow that's approaching them.)

1653
01:05:19,434 --> 01:05:20,905
Please save me just this once.

1654
01:05:21,265 --> 01:05:23,135
Please.

1655
01:05:24,374 --> 01:05:25,675
- Hurry. - Why?

1656
01:05:25,675 --> 01:05:26,734
Bo Mi.

1657
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:30,004
Hold on.

1658
01:05:31,615 --> 01:05:33,144
(Shrieking)

1659
01:05:34,215 --> 01:05:35,644
Hey.

1660
01:05:36,245 --> 01:05:37,385
Where were you?

1661
01:05:37,385 --> 01:05:39,314
(The assistant has appeared.)

1662
01:05:39,314 --> 01:05:41,454
(Bo Mi is eliminated.)

1663
01:05:41,454 --> 01:05:44,595
Bo Mi is eliminated.

1664
01:05:46,095 --> 01:05:47,095
(They're shocked by the news.)

1665
01:05:47,095 --> 01:05:48,925
What now? I'm scared.

1666
01:05:49,265 --> 01:05:50,394
If I get eliminated,

1667
01:05:51,195 --> 01:05:52,394
I can't even talk.

1668
01:05:53,064 --> 01:05:54,834
The assistant started moving.

1669
01:05:54,834 --> 01:05:57,135
(He's shocked.)

1670
01:06:02,044 --> 01:06:04,115
Is there anything up there? I can go up, right?

1671
01:06:04,115 --> 01:06:05,675
(The assistant did his first job.)

1672
01:06:05,914 --> 01:06:10,084
(Who will the next target be?)

1673
01:06:11,254 --> 01:06:12,254
Kwang Soo.

1674
01:06:13,354 --> 01:06:14,354
Come here.

1675
01:06:18,794 --> 01:06:19,995
There's nobody, right?

1676
01:06:21,995 --> 01:06:26,265
And the other person was a woman. It was a woman's neck.

1677
01:06:26,265 --> 01:06:27,434
(These two share information on the assistant.)

1678
01:06:29,104 --> 01:06:30,305
Who can rip mine off?

1679
01:06:30,305 --> 01:06:33,675
(They see Seok Jin and Kwang Soo together.)

1680
01:06:33,774 --> 01:06:35,475
(I'm 200 percent sure the assistant is Seok Jin.)

1681
01:06:35,644 --> 01:06:36,975
Come here, So Min.

1682
01:06:38,314 --> 01:06:40,745
(Let's get away and look for more hints.)

1683
01:06:41,245 --> 01:06:43,084
Where's the laptop?

1684
01:06:43,084 --> 01:06:45,515
(Jong Kook is also looking for more hints.)

1685
01:06:45,515 --> 01:06:48,124
(What's this?)

1686
01:06:48,885 --> 01:06:51,254
It's so obvious.

1687
01:06:52,695 --> 01:06:56,095
(Sung Rok finds a USB too.)

1688
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:57,564
I got it.

1689
01:06:59,195 --> 01:07:00,834
(Hint video 7)

1690
01:07:00,834 --> 01:07:01,864
Okay.

1691
01:07:03,305 --> 01:07:07,044
A crocodile cage? Why do people have to go in there?

1692
01:07:07,175 --> 01:07:09,504
I can't even imagine it. I'm so scared.

1693
01:07:14,944 --> 01:07:16,744
The assistant has a mole. Wait...

1694
01:07:18,614 --> 01:07:19,914
(He has a mole on the back of his neck.)

1695
01:07:20,055 --> 01:07:23,124
I'll never do it. I'm frightened of crocodiles.

1696
01:07:23,754 --> 01:07:25,124
We are normal.

1697
01:07:26,624 --> 01:07:30,265
(They are all cowards.)

1698
01:07:30,265 --> 01:07:31,694
One person has a mole on the back of his neck.

1699
01:07:32,494 --> 01:07:36,135
Hair is shaved at the back, so it must be a male.

1700
01:07:38,635 --> 01:07:39,675
The assistant...

1701
01:07:42,675 --> 01:07:45,515
(It's somebody who has a mole on his neck and is a coward.)

1702
01:07:46,744 --> 01:07:49,084
People keep running away from me.

1703
01:07:51,254 --> 01:07:52,515
(Is Seok Jin the assistant because Kwang Soo keeps on following him?)

1704
01:07:52,515 --> 01:07:54,954
Unless somebody calls and eliminates you...

1705
01:07:56,525 --> 01:07:57,794
I have to go on the other side.

1706
01:07:57,794 --> 01:08:00,324
(Se Chan looks quite busy too.)

1707
01:08:00,965 --> 01:08:01,965
Let's see.

1708
01:08:01,965 --> 01:08:05,465
(Jae Seok is hiding and checking his hint.)

1709
01:08:06,694 --> 01:08:08,864
I'm pretty worried.

1710
01:08:09,034 --> 01:08:12,135
I'm usually not very lucky.

1711
01:08:12,475 --> 01:08:15,074
I'm not that lucky either.

1712
01:08:16,244 --> 01:08:18,015
Should we perform an exorcism?

1713
01:08:19,614 --> 01:08:21,544
(Thinking)

1714
01:08:21,544 --> 01:08:23,885
(What is that watch?)

1715
01:08:25,015 --> 01:08:27,685
Jae Seok, please tell me. Is it somebody unexpected?

1716
01:08:28,654 --> 01:08:31,025
Jae Seok, we have to know so that we can work together.

1717
01:08:31,025 --> 01:08:32,324
- Exactly. - Right?

1718
01:08:33,124 --> 01:08:35,025
What's so shocking about it?

1719
01:08:35,025 --> 01:08:36,095
Hold on.

1720
01:08:36,765 --> 01:08:38,395
Is it not somebody you thought it was?

1721
01:08:38,565 --> 01:08:39,965
I'll share my hint.

1722
01:08:39,965 --> 01:08:41,735
Please tell us.

1723
01:08:41,735 --> 01:08:43,805
(He considers Haha's suggestion.)

1724
01:08:43,805 --> 01:08:46,305
No, I need to think about this.

1725
01:08:47,544 --> 01:08:48,605
Boss.

1726
01:08:49,404 --> 01:08:51,515
We made you win...

1727
01:08:51,775 --> 01:08:53,114
in Japan.

1728
01:08:53,114 --> 01:08:54,815
You are our king.

1729
01:08:55,185 --> 01:08:56,284
You are our boss.

1730
01:08:58,914 --> 01:09:02,185
(The 1st Place Tour in Osaka during the summer)

1731
01:09:02,185 --> 01:09:07,225
(Haha and So Min pledged allegiance to Jae Seok.)

1732
01:09:08,994 --> 01:09:13,395
(King Grasshopper, please pity us.)

1733
01:09:13,395 --> 01:09:14,664
I am...

1734
01:09:16,105 --> 01:09:18,805
really sorry but please leave.

1735
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:20,275
Jae Seok.

1736
01:09:20,645 --> 01:09:22,074
(It didn't work.)

1737
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:24,074
- Tell me the name. - I have to think about this.

1738
01:09:24,074 --> 01:09:25,645
- Tell us this. - Look at this.

1739
01:09:25,845 --> 01:09:29,544
(The new hint...)

1740
01:09:29,544 --> 01:09:31,515
(is this watch.)

1741
01:09:33,185 --> 01:09:34,624
(At the same time)

1742
01:09:35,555 --> 01:09:42,225
(Everybody is busy looking for hints.)

1743
01:09:42,324 --> 01:09:44,895
You had seafood jjajangmyeon today, right?

1744
01:09:44,895 --> 01:09:46,494
- Yes. - Can you give me a hint?

1745
01:09:46,494 --> 01:09:47,664
(She's so random.)

1746
01:09:47,834 --> 01:09:50,534
A hint? What does that have to do with eating jjajangmyeon?

1747
01:09:51,074 --> 01:09:52,834
I'll tell you one thing too.

1748
01:09:52,834 --> 01:09:53,845
- What is it? - A hint.

1749
01:09:53,845 --> 01:09:56,244
- Can you tell me? - Can you tell me something too?

1750
01:09:56,244 --> 01:10:00,244
(They are busy asking for each other's hint.)

1751
01:10:00,244 --> 01:10:03,015
(She's going to tell him a hint?)

1752
01:10:03,985 --> 01:10:05,254
You're the assistant, right?

1753
01:10:05,355 --> 01:10:06,555
- Me? - Yes.

1754
01:10:06,715 --> 01:10:08,254
You can report me and check.

1755
01:10:08,254 --> 01:10:09,425
(Se Chan pays attention to their conversation.)

1756
01:10:09,425 --> 01:10:10,555
I'm scared.

1757
01:10:11,294 --> 01:10:13,425
- I'm so scared. Se Chan. - What?

1758
01:10:13,425 --> 01:10:15,164
(He disappears when they're done talking.)

1759
01:10:15,164 --> 01:10:17,595
Did you get any hint?

1760
01:10:17,834 --> 01:10:19,664
No, I have nothing. He's scary.

1761
01:10:19,664 --> 01:10:21,834
- Are you going around together? - Sung Rok's eyes are scary.

1762
01:10:21,834 --> 01:10:23,065
(He disappears when they're done talking.)

1763
01:10:23,364 --> 01:10:27,475
(Is Se Chan really the assistant?)
s

1764
01:10:30,475 --> 01:10:32,444
This must be the set for "Temperature of Love".

1765
01:10:32,444 --> 01:10:34,215
(Temperature of Love)

1766
01:10:34,215 --> 01:10:35,544
This is so nice.

1767
01:10:35,744 --> 01:10:37,284
I can't do this.

1768
01:10:37,515 --> 01:10:40,385
I have to work. Let's work first, So Min.

1769
01:10:40,525 --> 01:10:42,355
Let's work and come back another time.

1770
01:10:43,494 --> 01:10:46,925
I've never been here before. May I come in?

1771
01:10:47,624 --> 01:10:50,794
(Se Chan signals somebody.)

1772
01:10:55,565 --> 01:10:56,935
There's no way out.

1773
01:10:57,435 --> 01:10:59,135
Can I go this way to get to the main building?

1774
01:10:59,275 --> 01:11:01,574
You have to get out to go to the main building.

1775
01:11:01,574 --> 01:11:04,315
- I think Seok Jin will be there. - You have to go back up.

1776
01:11:06,715 --> 01:11:08,815
No. Don't do this.

1777
01:11:09,315 --> 01:11:11,084
No way.

1778
01:11:11,815 --> 01:11:14,525
(Somebody is after So Min.)

1779
01:11:14,525 --> 01:11:15,525
No.

1780
01:11:15,824 --> 01:11:17,895
I'm going to lock it.

1781
01:11:18,124 --> 01:11:21,324
What do I do?

1782
01:11:21,494 --> 01:11:23,935
This isn't right.

1783
01:11:23,935 --> 01:11:25,765
(Please save me.)

1784
01:11:25,765 --> 01:11:26,794
My gosh.

1785
01:11:27,265 --> 01:11:29,135
My goodness. What do I do?

1786
01:11:29,135 --> 01:11:31,504
This isn't right. Don't do this.

1787
01:11:33,105 --> 01:11:35,944
I didn't know it'll end like this.

1788
01:11:35,944 --> 01:11:37,374
(Ripping sound)

1789
01:11:37,374 --> 01:11:41,315
So Min is eliminated.

1790
01:11:41,645 --> 01:11:43,284
So Min is eliminated.

1791
01:11:43,284 --> 01:11:45,914
(So Min is eliminated?)

1792
01:11:46,215 --> 01:11:47,425
Gosh.

1793
01:11:48,784 --> 01:11:49,855
I'm getting goose bumps.

1794
01:11:50,194 --> 01:11:51,494
I'm getting goose bumps.

1795
01:11:51,494 --> 01:11:52,824
(He doesn't know who the assistant is but he's frightened.)

1796
01:11:52,824 --> 01:11:54,994
There's a walkie-talkie.

1797
01:11:55,595 --> 01:11:59,794
(You get one chance to report the assistant.)

1798
01:11:59,794 --> 01:12:06,475
(If you get the wrong person, you are eliminated.)

1799
01:12:06,475 --> 01:12:08,544
(It's dangerous to report before you know who the assistant is.)

1800
01:12:08,544 --> 01:12:10,275
I've narrowed down,

1801
01:12:10,914 --> 01:12:12,244
but it's too early.

1802
01:12:16,414 --> 01:12:19,815
- Haha. - My gosh.

1803
01:12:22,355 --> 01:12:24,725
(He almost got a heart attack.)

1804
01:12:24,725 --> 01:12:26,124
This is not what I thought.

1805
01:12:26,124 --> 01:12:27,525
- Are you trying to get me? - No. Look.

1806
01:12:27,525 --> 01:12:28,994
Seok Jin...

1807
01:12:29,194 --> 01:12:32,135
Seok Jin didn't do anything...

1808
01:12:32,294 --> 01:12:34,305
- when Jae Seok was passing by. - Of course he would.

1809
01:12:34,305 --> 01:12:36,235
- Why? - So that he's not suspected.

1810
01:12:37,034 --> 01:12:38,574
Why did you look at my back?

1811
01:12:38,574 --> 01:12:39,904
- What do you mean? - Hey.

1812
01:12:39,904 --> 01:12:40,944
It's not me.

1813
01:12:41,044 --> 01:12:42,044
It's not me, Haha.

1814
01:12:42,145 --> 01:12:43,244
(Se Chan, you are a bit suspicious.)

1815
01:12:43,244 --> 01:12:44,544
- Hey. - Haha.

1816
01:12:46,845 --> 01:12:48,584
- Let's go look at it. - What is it? Do you have it?

1817
01:12:49,345 --> 01:12:50,555
Okay. Lead the way.

1818
01:12:50,815 --> 01:12:51,855
You lead the way.

1819
01:12:51,985 --> 01:12:53,985
Haha, we are going to the Nevis Swing together.

1820
01:12:54,185 --> 01:12:56,324
- Swing - All right.

1821
01:12:56,725 --> 01:12:58,725
- Later. - Okay.

1822
01:12:58,725 --> 01:12:59,855
Follow me.

1823
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:02,824
- What? - Go first.

1824
01:13:03,124 --> 01:13:05,494
- Let's see it together. Please. - No.

1825
01:13:06,294 --> 01:13:07,305
I'll join you later.

1826
01:13:07,805 --> 01:13:08,864
I trust you.

1827
01:13:09,265 --> 01:13:11,074
- All right? - I trust you, Haha.

1828
01:13:11,074 --> 01:13:12,105
Trust me.

1829
01:13:13,675 --> 01:13:16,105
(Something is fishy.)

1830
01:13:17,015 --> 01:13:18,675
Why aren't there any hints?

1831
01:13:18,675 --> 01:13:21,544
(Let me look for some hints.)

1832
01:13:25,454 --> 01:13:27,485
(Se Chan is lost. He's just looking for hints.)

1833
01:13:27,485 --> 01:13:29,124
There isn't any.

1834
01:13:31,425 --> 01:13:33,395
- Let's stop. - What?

1835
01:13:33,965 --> 01:13:35,164
Let's stop.

1836
01:13:35,925 --> 01:13:37,994
Let's stop.

1837
01:13:39,565 --> 01:13:42,105
(He was being suspected the whole time.)

1838
01:13:43,605 --> 01:13:44,805
Was it you?

1839
01:13:44,805 --> 01:13:45,805
Is it you?

1840
01:13:45,805 --> 01:13:46,874
(He's eliminated?)

1841
01:13:46,874 --> 01:13:48,704
What's this? What are you?

1842
01:13:51,414 --> 01:13:52,574
I'm the assistant.

1843
01:13:52,574 --> 01:13:53,744
(Se Chan is eliminated.)

1844
01:13:53,744 --> 01:13:54,885
You are?

1845
01:13:57,414 --> 01:14:00,885
- Se Chan is eliminated. - What?

1846
01:14:02,284 --> 01:14:03,754
Se Chan is eliminated?

1847
01:14:04,824 --> 01:14:07,294
(You are nothing special.)

1848
01:14:07,294 --> 01:14:08,364
I'm sorry.

1849
01:14:08,364 --> 01:14:10,794
(I'm sorry.)

1850
01:14:10,794 --> 01:14:11,834
Go.

1851
01:14:14,305 --> 01:14:15,364
Go to Australia.

1852
01:14:15,364 --> 01:14:17,374
(Go to Australia.)

1853
01:14:18,074 --> 01:14:19,074
Go.

1854
01:14:19,074 --> 01:14:21,645
(Am I going to see the crocodiles?)

1855
01:14:22,605 --> 01:14:24,444
I'm 100 percent sure that it's Seok Jin.

1856
01:14:24,444 --> 01:14:26,614
(With Se Chan being eliminated, there are not many candidates left.)

1857
01:14:26,614 --> 01:14:29,215
I got high-level information.

1858
01:14:29,584 --> 01:14:30,914
Ji Hyo covered her lips...

1859
01:14:30,914 --> 01:14:32,414
when she was talking about jjajangmyeon.

1860
01:14:32,414 --> 01:14:33,555
- Jjajangmyeon? - Yes.

1861
01:14:34,425 --> 01:14:36,525
(Jjajangmyeon?)

1862
01:14:36,525 --> 01:14:38,525
Okay. Got it.

1863
01:14:38,654 --> 01:14:40,694
I don't know anymore. I'm going to say it before I get eliminated.

1864
01:14:40,694 --> 01:14:41,694
(I'll do what's necessary.)

1865
01:14:41,694 --> 01:14:42,765
Find the walkie-talkie, quick.

1866
01:14:43,635 --> 01:14:46,395
(However)

1867
01:14:46,395 --> 01:14:47,605
I have goose bumps.

1868
01:14:50,305 --> 01:14:53,775
He has a mole right at the end of his hairline.

1869
01:14:53,775 --> 01:14:55,574
(Haha has a mole on his neck?)

1870
01:14:57,414 --> 01:15:02,444
(In the hint video he saw,)

1871
01:15:02,444 --> 01:15:06,824
(somebody had a mole at the same position.)

1872
01:15:07,985 --> 01:15:10,994
(Is Haha the assistant?)

1873
01:15:12,794 --> 01:15:15,824
He has it at the end.

1874
01:15:18,735 --> 01:15:21,404
(He does...)

1875
01:15:21,404 --> 01:15:27,504
(have a mole on his neck.)

1876
01:15:33,544 --> 01:15:35,845
It's Seok Jin, Sung Rok, or Haha?

1877
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:40,055
Each person...

1878
01:15:41,784 --> 01:15:43,694
- Did you see the hint? - I did.

1879
01:15:44,324 --> 01:15:45,694
- Did you? - It's not you.

1880
01:15:45,855 --> 01:15:46,965
No, I...

1881
01:15:48,895 --> 01:15:50,794
(What?)

1882
01:15:50,794 --> 01:15:53,465
(What's this ringtone?)

1883
01:15:54,465 --> 01:15:56,565
(A few minutes ago)

1884
01:15:56,565 --> 01:16:00,004
Another positive fact...

1885
01:16:00,544 --> 01:16:03,675
is that many members are unlucky. It's not little.

1886
01:16:04,775 --> 01:16:07,385
- Excuse me. - Let's work together. Good luck.

1887
01:16:07,385 --> 01:16:08,914
(The ringtone rang in the hint video.)

1888
01:16:08,914 --> 01:16:10,614
I heard the ringtone in the video.

1889
01:16:12,385 --> 01:16:13,685
It was that tone.

1890
01:16:16,185 --> 01:16:18,994
(Seok Jin got attacked too.)

1891
01:16:18,994 --> 01:16:21,595
(Who is this assistant?)

1892
01:16:22,425 --> 01:16:23,694
(Ripping off)

1893
01:16:23,694 --> 01:16:25,435
Seok Jin is eliminated.

1894
01:16:25,435 --> 01:16:28,235
(Seok Jin, a strong candidate, is eliminated.)

1895
01:16:28,235 --> 01:16:29,404
I get eliminated here.

1896
01:16:31,135 --> 01:16:34,904
(Five people are eliminated.)

1897
01:16:35,845 --> 01:16:36,975
Why are you here?

1898
01:16:37,914 --> 01:16:39,975
Stop lying.

1899
01:16:39,975 --> 01:16:41,544
- What? - Did you come here on purpose?

1900
01:16:41,544 --> 01:16:43,015
No, I'm eliminated.

1901
01:16:43,715 --> 01:16:46,185
- You are eliminated? - Did you ask another assistant?

1902
01:16:46,515 --> 01:16:48,254
- Hold on. - Let me see.

1903
01:16:48,254 --> 01:16:49,485
I'm not an assistant.

1904
01:16:50,225 --> 01:16:53,794
Why were you acting strange today?

1905
01:16:53,794 --> 01:16:55,364
You did that to me.

1906
01:16:55,364 --> 01:16:57,895
I kept on denying it.

1907
01:16:58,735 --> 01:17:00,404
I kept on denying it.

1908
01:17:00,404 --> 01:17:01,565
(This is so unfair.)

1909
01:17:04,175 --> 01:17:05,805
Is it Se Chan? Se Chan.

1910
01:17:06,374 --> 01:17:09,044
(They ran away from him.)

1911
01:17:09,044 --> 01:17:13,544
(They ran away from him for no reason.)

1912
01:17:13,544 --> 01:17:15,944
(She ran away teasingly.)

1913
01:17:16,485 --> 01:17:20,885
(You guys have been running away from me all day.)

1914
01:17:22,855 --> 01:17:26,425
(Kwang Soo was following him.)

1915
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:29,095
Go.

1916
01:17:29,164 --> 01:17:32,095
(He kept on coming back.)

1917
01:17:32,095 --> 01:17:36,305
(He handed over an empty box.)

1918
01:17:37,534 --> 01:17:43,074
(Ji Hyo saw it.)

1919
01:17:43,074 --> 01:17:45,475
(This is driving me nuts.)

1920
01:17:46,544 --> 01:17:48,015
(Is he really the assistant?)

1921
01:17:49,444 --> 01:17:51,985
(I'm not the assistant.)

1922
01:17:52,914 --> 01:17:54,154
I'm speechless.

1923
01:17:54,154 --> 01:17:56,925
I've been suspected all day, and now I'm out.

1924
01:17:57,654 --> 01:18:00,025
- It's Haha. - I kept on denying it.

1925
01:18:00,025 --> 01:18:02,425
It's Haha.

1926
01:18:02,425 --> 01:18:03,735
I told you it's him.

1927
01:18:04,034 --> 01:18:05,194
- It's him. - It's Haha.

1928
01:18:05,194 --> 01:18:07,404
- It's Haha and... - It's him.

1929
01:18:07,404 --> 01:18:08,534
(Is Haha the assistant?)

1930
01:18:10,435 --> 01:18:12,334
Are you eliminated?

1931
01:18:12,435 --> 01:18:14,645
- He's here. - Hey, assistant.

1932
01:18:14,775 --> 01:18:16,175
You're so it.

1933
01:18:16,175 --> 01:18:18,544
- The assistant? I'm eliminated too. - Really?

1934
01:18:20,315 --> 01:18:23,114
(Haha is eliminated?)

1935
01:18:24,215 --> 01:18:27,525
(5 minutes ago on rooftop of the annex)

1936
01:18:27,525 --> 01:18:32,855
(When you report the wrong person, you are out immediately.)

1937
01:18:32,855 --> 01:18:36,965
(Haha reported Seok Jin and Sung Rok.)

1938
01:18:38,034 --> 01:18:41,605
(I caught the assistants.)

1939
01:18:41,605 --> 01:18:44,805
Haha, you did not state the correct answer.

1940
01:18:45,334 --> 01:18:46,534
What?

1941
01:18:46,635 --> 01:18:49,704
Haha, you did not state the correct answer.

1942
01:18:49,775 --> 01:18:51,614
You are eliminated.

1943
01:18:51,614 --> 01:18:53,744
(Haha got eliminated for reporting the wrong people.)

1944
01:18:54,145 --> 01:18:55,784
I got confused...

1945
01:18:56,284 --> 01:18:59,555
and I remembered that Seok Jin had a mole on his neck.

1946
01:19:00,284 --> 01:19:04,895
But it's actually metallic poisoning, not a mole.

1947
01:19:07,565 --> 01:19:08,694
Metallic poisoning?

1948
01:19:09,425 --> 01:19:10,834
Do you wear necklaces?

1949
01:19:10,864 --> 01:19:13,135
- I don't. - You should wear gold.

1950
01:19:13,135 --> 01:19:15,704
They are cowards, right? And then?

1951
01:19:16,135 --> 01:19:18,404
- They like jjajangmyeon. - It's either Jong Kook or Jae Seok.

1952
01:19:18,404 --> 01:19:19,605
It's Jae Seok.

1953
01:19:19,605 --> 01:19:21,704
It's Jae Seok then, it can't be Jong Kook.

1954
01:19:21,775 --> 01:19:23,305
I told you it's Jae Seok.

1955
01:19:23,305 --> 01:19:24,715
(Is it really Jae Seok?)

1956
01:19:26,475 --> 01:19:28,685
(He's the new candidate now.)

1957
01:19:29,315 --> 01:19:30,414
This...

1958
01:19:30,414 --> 01:19:32,385
(Is he really...)

1959
01:19:33,624 --> 01:19:38,855
(The hint Jae Seok found said that the assistant is unlucky.)

1960
01:19:39,555 --> 01:19:44,994
(The camera closed up on the watch.)

1961
01:19:46,164 --> 01:19:48,704
It's Kwang Soo. He was wearing the watch.

1962
01:19:48,965 --> 01:19:50,635
There's the watch,

1963
01:19:51,275 --> 01:19:53,004
and I know how Kwang Soo's hand looks like.

1964
01:19:53,235 --> 01:19:54,904
Those are his hands.

1965
01:19:54,904 --> 01:19:57,614
(These hands are Kwang Soo's hands?)

1966
01:19:58,645 --> 01:20:01,015
Aren't you hungry? Should we order something?

1967
01:20:01,485 --> 01:20:03,485
- Should we have jjajangmyeon? - I like jjajangmyeon too.

1968
01:20:03,784 --> 01:20:06,154
Jjajangmyeon and jaengban jjajangmyeon, please.

1969
01:20:07,624 --> 01:20:12,754
(Kwang Soo ordered jjajangmyeon for lunch too.)

1970
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:18,465
It means this is a fabricated story.

1971
01:20:18,465 --> 01:20:19,565
(He puts the pieces of the puzzle together.)

1972
01:20:21,664 --> 01:20:23,034
This is a fabricated story.

1973
01:20:23,034 --> 01:20:26,904
(The jjajangmyeon and the watch sound like a fabricated story.)

1974
01:20:26,904 --> 01:20:27,904
It's one person.

1975
01:20:28,004 --> 01:20:32,574
(Is Kwang Soo the male assistant?)

1976
01:20:37,555 --> 01:20:39,855
(They come across each other.)

1977
01:20:39,855 --> 01:20:42,855
(Is Kwang Soo the assistant like Jae Seok predicted?)

1978
01:20:43,494 --> 01:20:44,794
Did you find a hint?

1979
01:20:45,124 --> 01:20:46,254
Yes.

1980
01:20:47,194 --> 01:20:50,235
(You found it.)

1981
01:20:52,235 --> 01:20:55,465
(He checks Kwang Soo's watch.)

1982
01:20:55,664 --> 01:20:56,834
You can't rip mine off.

1983
01:20:56,834 --> 01:20:57,874
(You can only give orders.)

1984
01:20:58,435 --> 01:21:00,544
No, only the assistant can.

1985
01:21:00,544 --> 01:21:01,645
Right.

1986
01:21:02,175 --> 01:21:05,345
(Only the assistant can.)

1987
01:21:06,414 --> 01:21:07,614
That's right.

1988
01:21:08,845 --> 01:21:09,985
Hold on.

1989
01:21:09,985 --> 01:21:11,454
(Let me see your wrist.)

1990
01:21:12,385 --> 01:21:13,485
(Goodness)

1991
01:21:13,485 --> 01:21:14,555
What's wrong?

1992
01:21:15,925 --> 01:21:17,055
You are...

1993
01:21:19,654 --> 01:21:22,425
(This watch was...)

1994
01:21:22,425 --> 01:21:26,194
(on the male assistant's wrist.)

1995
01:21:27,735 --> 01:21:31,975
(Does that mean...)

1996
01:21:31,975 --> 01:21:33,175
You are the guy.

1997
01:21:33,675 --> 01:21:34,775
You are the guy.

1998
01:21:34,775 --> 01:21:38,074
(Does that mean Kwang Soo is the male assistant?)

1999
01:21:40,114 --> 01:21:41,315
I think...

2000
01:21:41,315 --> 01:21:43,385
- it's time for you to go. - Where would I go?

2001
01:21:43,385 --> 01:21:45,385
(He's scary.)

2002
01:21:45,614 --> 01:21:46,685
What's wrong with you?

2003
01:21:46,685 --> 01:21:48,685
(Kwang Soo attacks.)

2004
01:21:48,685 --> 01:21:52,055
(He chases Jae Seok while calling somebody.)

2005
01:21:53,254 --> 01:21:55,864
Main building, 2nd floor.

2006
01:21:56,065 --> 01:21:57,395
What is he doing?

2007
01:21:57,965 --> 01:21:59,135
Main building, second floor for Jae Seok.

2008
01:21:59,465 --> 01:22:01,065
(He keeps on telling Jae Seok's location to somebody.)

2009
01:22:01,065 --> 01:22:02,534
It's Jae Seok. He's going back to the first floor.

2010
01:22:03,334 --> 01:22:04,504
He's going back to the first floor.

2011
01:22:04,504 --> 01:22:06,204
Where are you, girl?

2012
01:22:06,504 --> 01:22:09,574
(Is it Ji Hyo?)

2013
01:22:09,574 --> 01:22:12,914
(Is Ji Hyo the female assistant?)

2014
01:22:13,914 --> 01:22:18,914
(But the woman in the hint was unlucky and a coward.)

2015
01:22:18,914 --> 01:22:21,954
(That's totally opposite from Ji Hyo.)

2016
01:22:23,284 --> 01:22:28,895
(Then is Kwang Soo making this up?)

2017
01:22:28,895 --> 01:22:29,965
Hey.

2018
01:22:30,235 --> 01:22:32,395
Come here.

2019
01:22:33,465 --> 01:22:36,334
(Let me see your neck.)

2020
01:22:37,874 --> 01:22:40,744
(Jong Kook is watching another hint video.)

2021
01:22:41,975 --> 01:22:43,305
Hello.

2022
01:22:44,515 --> 01:22:47,215
(Kwang Soo went into the meeting room.)

2023
01:22:47,215 --> 01:22:49,345
(Some time passed and he came out.)

2024
01:22:49,345 --> 01:22:50,985
See you later. Thank you.

2025
01:22:52,355 --> 01:22:54,055
(The chair is empty.)

2026
01:22:54,055 --> 01:22:56,084
Thank you. Please drive safely.

2027
01:22:56,385 --> 01:22:57,494
Thank you.

2028
01:22:57,494 --> 01:22:59,624
(Is he talking to the empty chair?)

2029
01:23:03,895 --> 01:23:05,065
There's nobody.

2030
01:23:05,065 --> 01:23:06,095
(What's this?)

2031
01:23:06,465 --> 01:23:07,605
What's this?

2032
01:23:08,105 --> 01:23:09,135
Let me see.

2033
01:23:09,135 --> 01:23:11,334
(He's still trying to look at Kwang Soo's neck.)

2034
01:23:11,334 --> 01:23:12,534
You have a mole, right?

2035
01:23:13,904 --> 01:23:14,944
You do.

2036
01:23:17,744 --> 01:23:22,645
(Ji Hyo said the female assistant had a neck on her neck.)

2037
01:23:22,645 --> 01:23:24,084
- She has a mole? - Yes.

2038
01:23:28,725 --> 01:23:30,654
He has it.

2039
01:23:33,595 --> 01:23:37,765
(He has a mole in the same position as the female assistant.)

2040
01:23:38,595 --> 01:23:40,534
(Is Kwang Soo also the female assistant?)

2041
01:23:42,334 --> 01:23:45,105
(They're unlucky and cowardly.)

2042
01:23:45,105 --> 01:23:47,704
(They are so much like Kwang Soo.)

2043
01:23:47,704 --> 01:23:49,645
(The female assistant had a mole,)

2044
01:23:49,645 --> 01:23:52,475
(and the male assistant had a watch.)

2045
01:23:52,475 --> 01:23:56,544
(The watch is on Kwang Soo.)

2046
01:23:56,544 --> 01:24:00,355
(He also has a mole on his neck.)

2047
01:24:00,355 --> 01:24:01,385
(Hold on.)

2048
01:24:01,385 --> 01:24:02,454
Hold on.

2049
01:24:02,454 --> 01:24:04,225
(Does this mean...)

2050
01:24:04,225 --> 01:24:06,525
- Should we get jjajangmyeon? - I like jjajangmyeon.

2051
01:24:07,095 --> 01:24:08,294
I like jjajangmyeon too.

2052
01:24:08,294 --> 01:24:11,095
(They all like jjajangmyeon,)

2053
01:24:11,095 --> 01:24:14,935
(and they are all cowards.)

2054
01:24:14,935 --> 01:24:19,775
(They are unlucky as well.)

2055
01:24:23,244 --> 01:24:24,544
Is there no assistant?

2056
01:24:24,544 --> 01:24:26,114
(What's this?)

2057
01:24:26,114 --> 01:24:27,284
Is he by himself?

2058
01:24:27,284 --> 01:24:29,244
(Is Kwang Soo by himself?)

2059
01:24:30,485 --> 01:24:33,584
(The male assistant who wore a watch...)

2060
01:24:33,584 --> 01:24:36,994
(and the female assistant with a mole on her neck...)

2061
01:24:36,994 --> 01:24:40,025
(were all Kwang Soo.)

2062
01:24:40,025 --> 01:24:41,525
Is there no assistant?

2063
01:24:42,794 --> 01:24:43,895
Is he by himself?

2064
01:24:44,465 --> 01:24:45,565
Is Kwang Soo by himself?

2065
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:48,164
(He's frightened.)

2066
01:24:48,164 --> 01:24:49,265
That's insane.

2067
01:24:50,065 --> 01:24:51,334
I just have to find the walkie-talkie.

2068
01:24:51,334 --> 01:24:53,004
(He knows who the assistant is now.)

2069
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:58,414
He has the watch hint already?

2070
01:24:58,414 --> 01:24:59,574
(Oh, dear.)

2071
01:25:01,845 --> 01:25:08,225
(You can eliminate the assistant by speaking into the walkie-talkie.)

2072
01:25:11,055 --> 01:25:12,154
This is the end.

2073
01:25:13,095 --> 01:25:14,095
This is the end.

2074
01:25:15,164 --> 01:25:16,164
The assistant is...

2075
01:25:17,694 --> 01:25:18,735
Lee Kwang Soo.

2076
01:25:19,235 --> 01:25:20,704
He is faking it.

2077
01:25:24,034 --> 01:25:26,374
Eliminate Kwang Soo's name tag.

2078
01:25:26,374 --> 01:25:29,874
(Rip off Kwang Soo's name tag.)

2079
01:25:31,175 --> 01:25:33,374
You have to rip off Kwang Soo's name tag.

2080
01:25:33,374 --> 01:25:35,584
Gosh. This is unbelievable.

2081
01:25:37,414 --> 01:25:44,525
(Jae Seok has to rip Kwang Soo's name tag off.)

2082
01:25:45,525 --> 01:25:46,794
Where is he?

2083
01:25:46,794 --> 01:25:48,624
(Where are you, Kwang Soo?)

2084
01:25:51,694 --> 01:25:54,435
(He spots Kwang Soo.)

2085
01:25:57,675 --> 01:25:58,704
You are alone.

2086
01:25:59,504 --> 01:26:01,675
(Is he calling someone again?)

2087
01:26:02,874 --> 01:26:04,414
Who are you calling?

2088
01:26:06,885 --> 01:26:10,385
(Give me your name tag.)

2089
01:26:12,614 --> 01:26:17,355
(Kwang Soo did not expect Jae Seok's attack.)

2090
01:26:18,855 --> 01:26:21,595
(This will end now.)

2091
01:26:21,595 --> 01:26:25,694
(The situation reached its breaking point.)

2092
01:26:28,904 --> 01:26:33,404
(A phone starts to ring as Kwang Soo makes the call.)

2093
01:26:34,904 --> 01:26:36,605
(He stops.)

2094
01:26:44,784 --> 01:26:45,784
What's going on?

2095
01:26:46,685 --> 01:26:51,494
(Is there another assistant other than Kwang Soo?)

2096
01:26:53,725 --> 01:26:58,034
(Whose phone is ringing?)

2097
01:27:01,334 --> 01:27:05,105
(Hold on. He is...)

2098
01:27:05,105 --> 01:27:07,504
(Shin Sung Rok)

2099
01:27:07,845 --> 01:27:09,275
He is not alone.

2100
01:27:11,944 --> 01:27:13,744
(Hi, Jae Seok.)

2101
01:27:15,244 --> 01:27:18,515
(He starts running after Jae Seok without any hesitation.)

2102
01:27:18,515 --> 01:27:19,555
Sung Rok.

2103
01:27:21,725 --> 01:27:22,725
Grab him.

2104
01:27:22,725 --> 01:27:23,725
(He ran fast...)

2105
01:27:23,725 --> 01:27:25,324
(and ripped off Jae Seok's name tag.)

2106
01:27:25,324 --> 01:27:26,965
(He helps Kwang Soo to rip name tags off.)

2107
01:27:26,965 --> 01:27:28,965
(What's his identity?)

2108
01:27:30,065 --> 01:27:31,065
Is he alone?

2109
01:27:31,065 --> 01:27:32,465
(10 minutes earlier, after Jong Koon saw the hint.)

2110
01:27:32,465 --> 01:27:33,465
This is crazy.

2111
01:27:34,404 --> 01:27:37,435
(The hint was not over.)

2112
01:27:38,605 --> 01:27:42,574
(After Kwang Soo left,)

2113
01:27:42,574 --> 01:27:47,544
(Sung Rok came out quietly.)

2114
01:27:49,744 --> 01:27:52,015
We should decide...

2115
01:27:52,784 --> 01:27:55,485
who will get penalized this week.

2116
01:27:55,485 --> 01:27:56,485
(However)

2117
01:27:57,154 --> 01:27:59,494
Jjajangmyeon and jaengban jjajangmyeon, please.

2118
01:27:59,494 --> 01:28:00,794
(Jjajangmyeon and jaengban jjajangmyeon, please.)

2119
01:28:01,065 --> 01:28:03,065
(Jjajangmyeon and jaengban jjajangmyeon?)

2120
01:28:04,294 --> 01:28:06,235
(Jjajangmyeon is for Kwang Soo.)

2121
01:28:06,235 --> 01:28:09,805
(Jaengban jjajangmyeon is for Sung Rok.)

2122
01:28:10,534 --> 01:28:14,275
Why do we have to go inside the Cage of Death?

2123
01:28:14,645 --> 01:28:15,675
Please help me.

2124
01:28:16,044 --> 01:28:17,414
(When he reached out his arm for a handshake,)

2125
01:28:17,414 --> 01:28:20,985
(someone else grabbed his hand from another angle.)

2126
01:28:23,855 --> 01:28:26,454
(It was Sung Rok.)

2127
01:28:26,454 --> 01:28:29,225
(The hidden assistant was Sung Rok.)

2128
01:28:30,694 --> 01:28:31,725
Let's end this now.

2129
01:28:32,324 --> 01:28:34,494
(No one expected...)

2130
01:28:34,494 --> 01:28:38,135
(Sung Rok's name tag hunting.)

2131
01:28:42,034 --> 01:28:45,605
(Ji Hyo was eliminated by his quick and surprise attack.)

2132
01:28:48,675 --> 01:28:51,074
(To complete his mission,)

2133
01:28:51,074 --> 01:28:55,215
(he has to rip off Jong Kook's name tag.)

2134
01:28:56,044 --> 01:28:57,454
What's going on?

2135
01:28:57,485 --> 01:28:59,154
What's going on? Wasn't it you?

2136
01:28:59,154 --> 01:29:00,154
Wasn't it you?

2137
01:29:00,185 --> 01:29:01,254
I wasn't the assistant.

2138
01:29:01,254 --> 01:29:02,284
You were not the assistant?

2139
01:29:02,425 --> 01:29:03,454
It was his self-fabricated scenario.

2140
01:29:03,895 --> 01:29:06,095
Everyone in the video was Kwang Soo.

2141
01:29:06,095 --> 01:29:08,494
Was it computer graphics then?

2142
01:29:09,065 --> 01:29:10,494
- I don't get it. - What's going on?

2143
01:29:10,494 --> 01:29:12,095
- They were both Kwang Soo. - Were they?

2144
01:29:12,095 --> 01:29:13,294
Yes. It was Kwang Soo.

2145
01:29:13,294 --> 01:29:14,435
- And... - Then what about...

2146
01:29:14,435 --> 01:29:16,805
real assistants were not them.

2147
01:29:17,004 --> 01:29:19,504
It was Sung Rok who stayed separately.

2148
01:29:19,534 --> 01:29:21,074
Sung Rok is the assistant.

2149
01:29:21,574 --> 01:29:24,244
- We know that already. - We were eliminated by him.

2150
01:29:24,475 --> 01:29:25,914
- Oh, really? - Gosh.

2151
01:29:26,044 --> 01:29:27,885
(He's embarrassed.)

2152
01:29:27,885 --> 01:29:29,744
- He didn't know anything. - Why didn't you know that?

2153
01:29:31,355 --> 01:29:33,725
The assistant is Kwang Soo.

2154
01:29:33,985 --> 01:29:38,855
Rip off Kwang Soo's name tag.

2155
01:29:38,855 --> 01:29:41,425
(He is happy as he thinks he found the assistant.)

2156
01:29:43,095 --> 01:29:45,994
There is only Jong Kook's name tag left.

2157
01:29:45,994 --> 01:29:47,305
That's why we've to look for him.

2158
01:29:48,864 --> 01:29:51,404
(Aren't I clever?)

2159
01:29:54,004 --> 01:29:55,004
Gosh.

2160
01:29:56,275 --> 01:29:57,275
Kwang Soo.

2161
01:29:57,275 --> 01:29:58,275
(It's good to see you.)

2162
01:29:58,275 --> 01:30:00,414
You found the hint.

2163
01:30:00,414 --> 01:30:02,715
- Yes. - You found the hint.

2164
01:30:02,715 --> 01:30:05,154
- Okay. Let go of my arm first. - Hey you.

2165
01:30:05,154 --> 01:30:08,084
- You little... - Stop.

2166
01:30:08,084 --> 01:30:10,254
- Jong Kook. - What's going on?

2167
01:30:10,294 --> 01:30:11,294
Hey. What is this?

2168
01:30:11,425 --> 01:30:14,324
(What is going on?)

2169
01:30:14,324 --> 01:30:15,595
"I'm not the assistant."

2170
01:30:15,694 --> 01:30:17,864
(I'm not the assistant.)

2171
01:30:18,895 --> 01:30:20,504
(Oh, it's Sung Rok.)

2172
01:30:21,305 --> 01:30:22,435
Did he rip Kwang Soo's name tag off?

2173
01:30:22,435 --> 01:30:23,435
(Gosh)

2174
01:30:23,704 --> 01:30:26,305
I should go and protect the walkie-talkie.

2175
01:30:26,504 --> 01:30:27,504
I should go now.

2176
01:30:27,504 --> 01:30:28,504
(He wants to block Jong Kook from reporting.)

2177
01:30:30,475 --> 01:30:32,175
Let's run. We have to run now.

2178
01:30:32,645 --> 01:30:34,485
(If Sung Rok eliminates Jong Kook,)

2179
01:30:34,485 --> 01:30:38,284
(Kwang Soo can choose 2 people for the penalty.)

2180
01:30:39,355 --> 01:30:40,885
(This is the end.)

2181
01:30:40,885 --> 01:30:43,225
(Who will get to the walkie-talkie first?)

2182
01:30:45,225 --> 01:30:48,994
(Sung Rok arrives at the place after running with his everything.)

2183
01:30:48,994 --> 01:30:50,065
The assistant is...

2184
01:30:52,735 --> 01:30:55,465
(Jong Kook got here faster than Sung Rok.)

2185
01:30:57,334 --> 01:30:59,874
The assistant is Sung Rok.

2186
01:30:59,874 --> 01:31:02,574
(The assistant is Sung Rok.)

2187
01:31:02,574 --> 01:31:04,574
(The assistant Sung Rok is eliminated.)

2188
01:31:05,145 --> 01:31:08,845
I was lucky to spot Kwang Soo first.

2189
01:31:09,244 --> 01:31:11,055
I was so surprised.

2190
01:31:11,055 --> 01:31:12,284
(The race ends. Jong Kook receives the exemption pass.)

2191
01:31:14,084 --> 01:31:16,855
For the last Death Signal,

2192
01:31:17,154 --> 01:31:20,124
only Jong Kook received the exemption pass.

2193
01:31:20,694 --> 01:31:23,595
For the final decision,

2194
01:31:23,595 --> 01:31:27,435
Kwang Soo can rip the name tag off the member whom he wants to take with him.

2195
01:31:28,435 --> 01:31:30,275
(1 person will experience...)

2196
01:31:30,275 --> 01:31:32,904
(Cage of Death with Kwang Soo in Australia.)

2197
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:37,114
(Who will experience this horrifying crocodile with Kwang Soo?)

2198
01:31:38,574 --> 01:31:40,284
Everyone, make a short speech.

2199
01:31:41,315 --> 01:31:42,944
Just choose one.

2200
01:31:42,944 --> 01:31:45,784
(He is so sick of it.)

2201
01:31:46,715 --> 01:31:49,254
- Yes. - Those two can go to Australia...

2202
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:50,855
- on their way to New Zealand. - It's a good idea.

2203
01:31:50,855 --> 01:31:52,095
- It's okay. - Is it?

2204
01:31:52,095 --> 01:31:54,065
- It costs us even less that way. - Can we do that?

2205
01:31:54,994 --> 01:31:55,994
Kwang Soo.

2206
01:31:56,595 --> 01:31:58,294
- Nevis Swing is... - I think...

2207
01:31:58,294 --> 01:31:59,465
on the way to Australia and New Zealand,.

2208
01:31:59,465 --> 01:32:03,204
Why do you care so much?

2209
01:32:03,635 --> 01:32:05,004
I'll listen to him first.

2210
01:32:05,004 --> 01:32:10,414
There are also some members who didn't get any penalties.

2211
01:32:10,614 --> 01:32:14,244
I think we should balance it out a bit.

2212
01:32:14,244 --> 01:32:16,084
- I agree. - I think so too.

2213
01:32:16,084 --> 01:32:17,985
I will just say one thing.

2214
01:32:17,985 --> 01:32:20,885
Haha and I have to go and experience Nevis Swing.

2215
01:32:20,885 --> 01:32:22,584
- Okay. You don't need to go. - I've done everything.

2216
01:32:22,584 --> 01:32:23,895
(Okay. I won't choose Se Chan.)

2217
01:32:24,324 --> 01:32:26,355
- Why? - Gosh. Thank you so much.

2218
01:32:26,355 --> 01:32:28,364
Why? Why are you not choosing him?

2219
01:32:28,364 --> 01:32:29,395
(Why did he choose Se Chan over me?)

2220
01:32:29,395 --> 01:32:30,565
- I even went to Indonesia. - Good.

2221
01:32:30,565 --> 01:32:32,435
- Thank you. - You had a hard time.

2222
01:32:32,465 --> 01:32:33,904
Thank you. Let's go!

2223
01:32:33,904 --> 01:32:35,504
(Did you forget?)

2224
01:32:36,765 --> 01:32:38,175
Gosh. So Min also...

2225
01:32:38,475 --> 01:32:40,805
True. So Min also went there.

2226
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:44,114
I even went to Indonesia.

2227
01:32:45,275 --> 01:32:46,985
- Why are you doing this? - Why are you kneeling?

2228
01:32:46,985 --> 01:32:48,145
Why are you kneeling?

2229
01:32:48,145 --> 01:32:50,185
Her knees are lighter than the feathers.

2230
01:32:50,185 --> 01:32:51,215
She kneels all the time.

2231
01:32:51,215 --> 01:32:52,515
We went to Indonesia together.

2232
01:32:52,515 --> 01:32:53,584
(Do you remember that?)

2233
01:32:54,725 --> 01:32:56,994
- Okay. Let's not choose So Min. - I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

2234
01:32:58,454 --> 01:33:00,395
(I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.)

2235
01:33:00,395 --> 01:33:02,494
(I'm scared of crocodiles.)

2236
01:33:03,364 --> 01:33:05,265
- I'm sorry too. - I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

2237
01:33:05,265 --> 01:33:07,364
Jae Seok and Seok Jin are just standing still.

2238
01:33:07,404 --> 01:33:08,735
Why do we have to lie down on the floor?

2239
01:33:08,735 --> 01:33:11,275
- I'm even old. - Haha is just standing still.

2240
01:33:11,275 --> 01:33:12,704
- Kwang Soo, I'm sorry. - Kwang Soo.

2241
01:33:12,704 --> 01:33:15,244
- Kwang Soo. - He isn't lying down properly.

2242
01:33:15,244 --> 01:33:17,874
(He wanted to keep his dignity.)

2243
01:33:17,874 --> 01:33:19,414
Okay. Get up, Seok Jin.

2244
01:33:19,775 --> 01:33:21,284
- Kwang Soo. - First of all,

2245
01:33:21,284 --> 01:33:23,914
So Min went to Indonesia a while ago.

2246
01:33:24,584 --> 01:33:25,715
She's not going then.

2247
01:33:26,084 --> 01:33:27,885
You survived.

2248
01:33:28,855 --> 01:33:33,494
Anyway, Kwang Soo still needs to decide...

2249
01:33:33,494 --> 01:33:35,994
the person he wants to take from the rest.

2250
01:33:35,994 --> 01:33:38,065
Everyone is a coward except Ji Hyo.

2251
01:33:38,065 --> 01:33:39,095
That's right.

2252
01:33:39,095 --> 01:33:40,965
I can see that only cowards are left.

2253
01:33:40,965 --> 01:33:43,404
- We are cowards except Ji Hyo. - That's right.

2254
01:33:44,904 --> 01:33:45,935
On Chuseok...

2255
01:33:46,374 --> 01:33:49,204
I had to do my penalty mission on Chuseok.

2256
01:33:49,204 --> 01:33:51,074
You already had a penalty last week.

2257
01:33:51,074 --> 01:33:52,775
Jae Seok, you can come to this side.

2258
01:33:53,074 --> 01:33:55,444
- Oh really? - You can come this side.

2259
01:33:55,444 --> 01:33:58,185
(Jae Seok survived.)

2260
01:33:58,954 --> 01:34:00,525
Why?

2261
01:34:00,525 --> 01:34:02,725
(I hate him.)

2262
01:34:02,985 --> 01:34:03,994
Why?

2263
01:34:03,994 --> 01:34:04,994
(Have a safe trip to Australia.)

2264
01:34:04,994 --> 01:34:07,624
(Ripping off)

2265
01:34:09,395 --> 01:34:10,994
(Ripping off)

2266
01:34:10,994 --> 01:34:14,435
(He just ripped off Jae Seok's name tag. What's going on?)

2267
01:34:14,435 --> 01:34:15,435
Gosh.

2268
01:34:15,435 --> 01:34:17,605
(What are you doing?)

2269
01:34:18,105 --> 01:34:20,305
(What's going on?)

2270
01:34:20,805 --> 01:34:23,044
(Kwang Soo chooses Jae Seok as his partner to Australia.)

2271
01:34:23,275 --> 01:34:25,215
I thought he was going to take my name tag.

2272
01:34:25,215 --> 01:34:26,675
(Everyone is confused.)

2273
01:34:27,084 --> 01:34:28,244
I thought so too.

2274
01:34:28,244 --> 01:34:30,254
Didn't you tell me to stand this side?

2275
01:34:30,254 --> 01:34:31,815
Yes, to rip off your name tag.

2276
01:34:32,614 --> 01:34:36,525
All right. Kwang Soo's partner to Australia is...

2277
01:34:37,454 --> 01:34:38,925
Jae Seok.

2278
01:34:39,095 --> 01:34:41,095
- You did a great job. - Great.

2279
01:34:41,095 --> 01:34:43,364
There are so many twists.

2280
01:34:43,364 --> 01:34:44,534
You are awesome.

2281
01:34:44,534 --> 01:34:45,565
It's awesome.

2282
01:34:46,465 --> 01:34:48,105
Am I really going then?

2283
01:34:48,105 --> 01:34:49,235
Cage of Death.

2284
01:34:50,605 --> 01:34:53,805
(You...)

2285
01:34:53,805 --> 01:34:56,845
(worked...)

2286
01:34:56,845 --> 01:34:59,874
(so hard.)

2287
01:34:59,874 --> 01:35:03,084
(You can do whatever you want.)

2288
01:35:03,715 --> 01:35:07,355
(There will be no penalty. It's time to have fun.)

2289
01:35:07,355 --> 01:35:10,454
(Let's do anything we want.)

2290
01:35:12,425 --> 01:35:14,824
(This is not how I imagined.)

2291
01:35:14,925 --> 01:35:18,135
(This is not a penalty, right?)

2292
01:35:18,334 --> 01:35:21,164
(I did everything I wanted.)

2293
01:35:21,164 --> 01:35:23,435
(I want it to end.)

2294
01:35:25,574 --> 01:35:27,475
(Let's stop. My underwear is wet.)

2295
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:30,544
(Autumn Vacation Race)

2296
01:35:31,315 --> 01:35:35,315
(Running Man)
