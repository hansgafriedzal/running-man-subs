Let's go and collect money.

9
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:51,290
I heard this cafe serves delicious coffee.

10
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,451
Hey, hey.

11
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:55,690

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,771
(She is the owner of the cafe who agreed to the shoot.)

Are you the owner?

18
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:13,510
You can't run a cafe without us.

19

00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:18,411
(Maybe we should stop, So Min.)

21
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,411
She looks aggressive.

22
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:22,480
The owner of the cafe seems to be older than us.

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,120
(The owner of the cafe bursts out laughing.)

24
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,721
(It's my turn.)

25
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:28,161

All right, President Kim.

36

64
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:00,880
Do you have folliculitis? Do you have face mites?

65
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,051
- I couldn't pop it all the way. - Really?

66
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:03,250
It's too painful.

90
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,961
- She didn't watch the movie. - You folliculitis!

91
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:47,160
She didn't watch "The Outlaws".

92
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,431
How dare you order me around?

93
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:50,630
I don't have to act according to my character, right?

94
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,970

95

96
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:58,171
- Shoot me! - Don't be ridiculous.

97
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,370
This is getting out of hand.

98
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,340
You can't treat her like this. Shoot me instead.

99
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,211
This is upsetting. We gave you so much money.

100
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:04,481
- I understand that but... - Don't be ridiculous.

101
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:05,551
- You are doing well. - This is upsetting.

102
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:06,951
- You are doing well. - This is "The Outlaws".

103
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:08,120
- You can't treat her like this. - Come on.

104
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,681
Don't confuse it with another movie.

105
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:13,320

106
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,320

- You are confusing the movie. - We are not in Busan.

109
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,830
This isn't "Nameless Gangster: Rules of Time".

110
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,830
We are in Yanbian. Get it right.

111
00:04:21,931 --> 00:04:24,370
I doubt the production crew will use more of this bit.

112
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,770
- Bring us coffee. - Bring us coffee.

113
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:27,640
Folliculitis!

114
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,801
"Folliculitis"?

115
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,401

This is nice.

120

127
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,091
(They back away.)

128
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:55,130

(Kwon Ryul)

138
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,861
Do you have company?

139
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,130
- Did you eat? - Not yet.

140
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:26,760
Then why are you so fat?

141
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:30,500
(They are known to attack with facts.)

142
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,171
Did you come alone?

143
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:33,200
It's exactly like the movie.

144
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,101
No way.

145
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,101
(Their costumes are high-quality.)

146
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:38,111
- They look really scary. - Did you come alone?

147
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,510
It must have been hard to get made up.

148
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:41,580
Isn't he Hwang Jung Min?

149
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,210
- This is "The Wailing". - "The Wailing".

150
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:45,781
This is "The Wailing".

151
00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:47,620
Please act like Young Gu.

152
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,221
(He looks like Young Gu.)

153
00:05:49,221 --> 00:05:50,450
I am sorry,

154
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,151
but he is Lim Ha Ryong.

155
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,460
He looks like Lim Ha Ryong.

156
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,491
- He looks like Lim Ha Ryong. - He does.

157
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:57,630
- He looks like Lim Ha Ryong. - Seriously.

158
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,291
"I am too old for this."

159
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,161
- "I am too old for this." - My goodness.

160
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,500
Kwang Soo looks exactly like the character in the movie.

161
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,031
Kwang Soo's makeup took forever.

162
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,000
It must have been hard to get that makeup done.

163
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,841
Let's not make any comment on it.

164
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,671
- Why not? - "Why not?"

165
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,181
- Make fun of me. - Let's leave him be.

166
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:15,380
It took an hour and a half.

167
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,450
He is Krillin.

168
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,921
- Do you think it's summer? - What?

169
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,151
Are you a physical education teacher?

170
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:24,320
Let's give a powerful performance.

171
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,890
- Do you know who we are? - What?

172
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,320
Do you know who we are?

173
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,361
Who are you?

174
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,861
The fight is on.

175
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,330
What did you say?

176
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,091
- Who are you? - He looks strong.

177
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:34,661
For goodness' sake.

178
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:35,901
Who are you?

179
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,200
(Pushing)

180
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,231
(He falls backwards.)

181
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:41,901
What do you think you are doing?

182
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,101
Nose Tae.

183
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:44,310
A staff member shouldn't interfere.

184
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,741
Go away.

185
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:46,741
Come on.

186
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:47,781
(Young Gu doesn't understand the situation.)

187
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:49,481
- He looks exactly like Young Gu. - Don't touch him.

188
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,950
What is this?

189
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,051
What is this?

190
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:54,281
Do you want to get slapped?

191
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:56,520
- Please stop. - Seok Jin,

192
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,651
- your performance is too much. - Please stop.

193
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,491
You have never been in a comedy skit, right?

194
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:02,190
He has never been in a comedy skit.

195
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,661
I haven't been in a lot of them.

196
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,161
What kind of a dialect is that?

197
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,431
For goodness' sake.

198
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:10,971
- What kind of a dialect is that? - He just sounds cute.

199
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:13,231
- Do you know who I am? - I haven't been in a lot of them.

200
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:16,401
The race, City of Crime,

201
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,541
is not about getting a penalty, but about winning prize money.

202
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:24,551
(City of Crime)

203
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:26,281
It's in a long time.

204
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,950
- It's about prize money? - I see.

205
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,250
The winning gang in each mission...

206
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:34,091
will be given working capital to their digital moneybox.

207
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:38,431
Only one member of the gang with the most amount of capital...

208
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,960
will engross the money in the end.

209
00:07:42,101 --> 00:07:44,171
- Only one? - So only one will take the money.

210
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:46,101
- It's an individual game. - That's right.

211
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:47,901
Each gang will have a boss as well.

212
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:53,171
Your bosses will be among the three guests who will join us later.

213
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:54,481
- We have guests? - We have guests.

214
00:07:54,481 --> 00:07:55,481
- Three guests. - Is that right?

215
00:07:55,481 --> 00:07:56,611
I didn't know.

216
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,181
I hope we don't have any female guests today.

217
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:01,181
Please.

218
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,750
- Please. - I hope.

219
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,051
- I hope they're male guests. - Who are they?

220
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:06,051
- What? - This song's from "The Godfather".

221
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:07,690
- "The Godfather". - Maybe it's Lim Ha Ryong.

222
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,791
- Really? - "The Godfather".

223
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,661
(Who's the first guest to come out along with this music?)

224
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:14,231
- Gosh. - Noh Sa Yeon.

225
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,901
Sa Yeon.

226
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,431
- Sa Yeon. - Hi.

227
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,101
- Are you here alone? - Yes.

228
00:08:20,741 --> 00:08:21,901
- Gosh. - Hi, Sa Yeon.

229
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,010
- Hello. - Hi.

230
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,111
Sa Yeon.

231
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,940
(The godmother intimidates the members as soon as she joins.)

232
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,841
- Hello. - Ms. Tuna.

233
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:29,841
(Oh, right.)

234
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:33,210
She had a bad experience during her last appearance.

235
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:36,580
(Sa Yeon came out on the Princess Special in July 15, 2012.)

236
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,850
(Her butler, Kwang Soo, was too weak to serve her right.)

237
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,590
It looks like you're fishing her out of a net.

238
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,690
(She was as energetic as a tuna.)

239
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,791
You think she's a tuna or something?

240
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,261
(And so became her nickname, Ms. Tuna.)

241
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,801
- Your outfit today... - Mackerel.

242
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:51,871
reminds me of a mackerel.

243
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:53,531
It's blue like a mackerel.

244
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,940
- Let's call her Ms. Mackerel today. - Goodness.

245
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:57,440
- Blue mackerel. - Mackerel.

246
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,710
- She's our guest for today. - It goes perfect for the special.

247
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,181
- Sa Yeon, you're... - Kwang Soo?

248
00:09:02,181 --> 00:09:04,080
- Well... - She burst out laughing.

249
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,450
- I'm losing my confidence. - Enjoy.

250
00:09:06,551 --> 00:09:08,751
- Feel free to laugh at him. - I feel so timid and shy.

251
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,651
Sa Yeon is here with us as our first boss today.

252
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:15,560
- Welcome, Sa Yeon. - Thank you.

253
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,261
- Let's bring in our next boss. - Okay.

254
00:09:17,261 --> 00:09:19,330
(Who's the second boss?)

255
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:21,161
- What's this? - Is this "Wonder Woman"?

256
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,261
It's "Superman".

257
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,470
(The next boss comes out with the song from "The Smurfs".)

258
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,570
Goodness, it's Ha Yeon Soo.

259
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,070
(She's the smile captain, Ha Yeon Soo.)

260
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:31,011
- Hello. - Goodness.

261
00:09:31,011 --> 00:09:32,740
- It's you, Yeon Soo. - Hello.

262
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,911
- Hello. - Long time no see.

263
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:37,080
- Hello. - It's so good to see you.

264
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,710
- Hello. - Hi.

265
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,210
(He's flustered to see Yeon Soo.)

266
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:41,580
- She's like a doll. - How...

267
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,251
- She hasn't changed a bit. - Kwang Soo...

268
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,350
What should he do?

269
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,990
How have you been, Yeon Soo?

270
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,031
(Stepping away)

271
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:52,960
- Goodness. - How have you been?

272
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,431
(I've changed a lot, haven't I?)

273
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,330
- Kwang Soo. - My goodness.

274
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:58,570
- I missed you. - Wear this.

275
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,171
That'll make it weirder.

276
00:10:00,171 --> 00:10:02,570
- Wear this. - What should he do?

277
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:04,171
Her face is so small.

278
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,740
- It's so small. - It's unbelievable.

279
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,580
If you want to get along with me, you better stand 1m ahead.

280
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,580
Okay.

281
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,950
Now, they look the same size.

282
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,281
- Let me see. - Does it seem all right?

283
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,681
Your face is still a bit bigger.

284
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:16,881
(Sa Yeon's face is still bigger.)

285
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:18,251
- What? - Step back a little more.

286
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,921
- There you go. - It's done.

287
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:21,921
- It's done. - This will do it.

288
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,460
- Good. - Goodness.

289
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,860
Yeon Soo's so cruel. She really stands in the front.

290
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,761
I'm so glad to have her with us.

291
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:33,330
All right. Let's see who's our third boss.

292
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,470
- We have one more? - Kwang Soo...

293
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,110
Please come on out.

294
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,110
(Who's their third boss?)

295
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,781
- What? - What?

296
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:43,980
Is it Kang Daniel?

297
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:45,911
It must be Wanna One.

298
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,480
(Wanna One's "Pick Me" gets played.)

299
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,220
(They mentioned his name many times, but he hasn't come out yet.)

300
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,261
(Is it the trendy idol group Wanna One's Kang Daniel?)

301
00:10:54,261 --> 00:10:56,161
(You've waited for so long.)

302
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,661
What's this?

303
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:03,100
(They had false hope.)

304
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,970
Why are you here again?

305
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,671
(Call him Cho Daniel.)

306
00:11:07,671 --> 00:11:09,570
He should've at least changed the opening song.

307
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:11,570
He comes out too often.

308
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,371
(Sae Ho, you aren't the one we've waited for.)

309
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:14,381
Goodbye.

310
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,610
- Goodness, Sae Ho. - Do I get in the car?

311
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,080
- Yes. - In this car?

312
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,921
I'm sorry, but this isn't my car.

313
00:11:22,921 --> 00:11:25,350
Really? Don't worry. He'll give you a ride.

314
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,751
Please go home.

315
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:28,060
- Bye. - Sorry.

316
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,261
- I won't see you off. - You've gotten a makeover.

317
00:11:30,261 --> 00:11:31,631
- Yes. - Bye.

318
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:33,460
- Good job for today. - He got the wrong schedule.

319
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,161
- Bye. - He gave us a big impact though.

320
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,730
- That was short but thick. - I'd just go home if I were him.

321
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,970
- It's not good for him either. - Good job.

322
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:41,871
It hasn't been long since he last appeared.

323
00:11:41,871 --> 00:11:44,710
- And the song was the same. - We're fed up with it.

324
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,740
Right.

325
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,980
(It should be okay to go again now.)

326
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,340
- He comes too often. - I know.

327
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,350
- He's here again. - He came out not long ago.

328
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,381
The driver... What?

329
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:54,381
Try it.

330
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,551
(The crew members give him another chance to dance.)

331
00:11:56,551 --> 00:11:57,820
There he goes again.

332
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,521
Sae Ho's dance is always entertaining.

333
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:00,521
(Let me show you how I dance.)

334
00:12:03,661 --> 00:12:05,960
(Let's dance together, Sae Ho.)

335
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,431
Let's dance together.

336
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,570
I'm doing this for your sake.

337
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,200
- Please welcome, Sae Ho. - Hello.

338
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,041
- Sae Ho never lets us down. - Come this way.

339
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,171
- He never lets us down. - Hello.

340
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:20,310
Sae Ho is with us as our guest for today.

341
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,950
- He's not talking. - Is he a streetlamp or what?

342
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:26,110
- Goodness. - He's so reserved today.

343
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,551
- Kwang Soo. - You know, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?

344
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:32,051
- What are you talking about? - Abdul-Jabbar.

345
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,921
- He looks like him. - Goodness.

346
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:36,460
No, he looks like Squidward from "Spongebob Squarepants".

347
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,661
What do you mean?

348
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,431
(Kwang Soo just looks funny.)

349
00:12:39,431 --> 00:12:42,100
All right, let's bring in...

350
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,470
- our next guest. - We have another guest?

351
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,001
- What? - There's one more?

352
00:12:46,171 --> 00:12:47,171
Please come out.

353
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,470
What?

354
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,911
Will it be Nam Chang Hee?

355
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,440
Nam Chang Hee?

356
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:56,080
Right, it's about time he joined us.

357
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,980
Who is it?

358
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,480
Right, it's about time he joined us.

359
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,450
(Their eyes open wide.)

360
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:06,690
(Who's the fourth guest?)

361
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,460
(He's Wanna One's Kang Daniel.)

362
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,060
(Daniel is really here!)

363
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,001
- Really? - Goodness.

364
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:17,671
- He's here. - Goodness.

365
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,171
- Daniel! - Goodness.

366
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:20,600
- Daniel. - Hi.

367
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:21,871
Daniel.

368
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,310
(The trendy star is finally on Running Man.)

369
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,980
- Hello. - It's really Kang Daniel.

370
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,210
(He's the real star among the ladies.)

371
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,340
Daniel.

372
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,710
- Daniel. - He's so handsome.

373
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,781
- He's cute. - Goodness.

374
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,490
- Daniel. - Gosh.

375
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,791
- Gosh. - Come to the middle.

376
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,921
- I'm sorry, - Daniel.

377
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,391
- but why are you blushing? - I was so surprised.

378
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,330
So many people are gathered here.

379
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:50,161
- They aren't usually like this. - They're hurting my feelings.

380
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:54,171
This is upsetting. I mean, we're well aware that they like Daniel.

381
00:13:54,271 --> 00:13:56,440
- It's all right. - Of course.

382
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,271
But when we do our opening, they usually...

383
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,310
- I know, they pick their noses. - You're right.

384
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,181
Some of them look very unfamiliar.

385
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,551
Daniel is here with us.

386
00:14:06,551 --> 00:14:08,350
- Daniel! - They're going crazy here.

387
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,080
- They usually don't say much. - Right.

388
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,421
Daniel!

389
00:14:11,421 --> 00:14:12,421
(All of a sudden)

390
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,460
It's over.

391
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,690
She has her eyes on him, so you have no chance.

392
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,531
- Give in. - Goodness.

393
00:14:18,531 --> 00:14:19,860
You can't go near him.

394
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,531
Anyway, I should mention this.

395
00:14:22,531 --> 00:14:25,931
This year is Sa Yeon's 40th-year anniversary since her debut.

396
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:28,070
- Really? - 40th-year anniversary.

397
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,200
She debuted when I was two years old.

398
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,710
I'm planning to hold a dinner show at the end of this year...

399
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,950
to celebrate my debut anniversary.

400
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,921
- Congratulations. - Dinner show.

401
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,181
Does that mean you'll cook dinner yourself?

402
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:44,950
Yes, I'll cook myself.

403
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,190
- That's new. - Goodness.

404
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,621
- I bet the dishes will be amazing. - This is...

405
00:14:49,261 --> 00:14:51,460
You'll eat, and the audience will give a round of applause for that.

406
00:14:51,761 --> 00:14:53,190
- Goodness. - That's not it.

407
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,730
The show will be about eating.

408
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,860
"You can do it! Finish one more bowl."

409
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,330
Goodness.

410
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,070
That's not it. She's planning to hold her own talk show.

411
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,671
- To celebrate her anniversary. - Congratulations.

412
00:15:02,671 --> 00:15:04,871
She's our big senior in this field. She's admirable.

413
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,371
- Right. - I hope...

414
00:15:06,371 --> 00:15:07,881
- Hold on. - What?

415
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,411
Will you keep being like this today, Kwang Soo?

416
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,310
Will you keep being like this today, Kwang Soo?

417
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,080
- Just wear this. - He doesn't talk at all.

418
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,580
- He should regain his confidence. - That makeover's too much.

419
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,350
He lost a lot of confidence ever since Yeon Soo came out.

420
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,860
- You should've told me before. - Goodness.

421
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,830
- Kwang Soo... - I didn't know.

422
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,960
Be confident.

423
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,761
He lost confidence because of Yeon Soo.

424
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:28,261
- I really didn't know. - He'd be like that all day long.

425
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,200
Yeon Soo is his type.

426
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,271
- She is. - Someone cute and small.

427
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:35,440
Yeon Soo gave me this look as if she was looking at an insect.

428
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,710
Kwang Soo likes girls who are like Yeon Soo.

429
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:42,480
I remember when Yeon Soo came out last time, she played...

430
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,881
- that game with Jong Kook. - I remember it too.

431
00:15:44,881 --> 00:15:46,051
The kiss.

432
00:15:46,051 --> 00:15:48,251
The video clip is still on the internet.

433
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,950
That video is still all over the internet.

434
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,021
So many people watched it too.

435
00:15:52,421 --> 00:15:54,161
What? Oh, that's the one.

436
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,190
- Gosh, this. - I mean...

437
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,261
- Check this out. - Stop it.

438
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,060
- When she came out... - It was the first time.

439
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,161
Look at Jong Kook's gums.

440
00:16:03,431 --> 00:16:06,330
- It's disgusting. - I tried not to touch her lips.

441
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,100
Look. Let me clarify things for you.

442
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,911
This is when he played the game with Yeon Soo.

443
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,440
This is when he played the game with Sa Yeon.

444
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,580
Goodness.

445
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,881
- I knew it. - Goodness.

446
00:16:18,881 --> 00:16:20,820
- Why you little... - Calm down.

447
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,480
- You're mistaken. - You're unbelievable.

448
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,450
He really didn't want to touch her lips.

449
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,190
What scares me the most is not Jong Kook...

450
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,521
but that Sa Yeon's smiling there.

451
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,060
(Sa Yeon's smiling in this picture.)

452
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,891
Goodness. I'm serious.

453
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,931
(Haha indeed has amazing observation skills.)

454
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,100
(Sa Yeon's experienced enough to keep her smile in any situation.)

455
00:16:39,901 --> 00:16:43,541
All right, let's talk briefly about you, Sae Ho.

456
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,171
There's one question for you.

457
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,080
"You join us once every month, so why is that?"

458
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:50,281
(Why do you keep coming out?)

459
00:16:50,281 --> 00:16:51,651
- It's a question. - Oh, is that right?

460
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:53,281
- It says in the script here. - It's real.

461
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,580
- It's real. - I'm telling you.

462
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,391
- It's really written on the script. - Why?

463
00:16:58,391 --> 00:16:59,551
- Why would I lie? - Gosh.

464
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,460
- I don't make up stories. - Okay.

465
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,590
Let me tell you this again.

466
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,730
The crew members did ask me to come out.

467
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,960
I asked you the other time as well, but who cast you?

468
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,331
The scriptwriter named Eun Kyung. There she is.

469
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,601
- Eun Kyung? - Yes.

470
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,101
- That's how it happened. - Eun Kyung gave me a call.

471
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,111
She said, "You're available on Monday, right?"

472
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,540
- She was certain. - She wasn't asking.

473
00:17:20,681 --> 00:17:21,780
- Wait. - She knew.

474
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,881
- She didn't ask if you were free? - No, she didn't.

475
00:17:23,881 --> 00:17:25,550
She said as if she was certain I was free on Monday.

476
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:28,980
- "Wait." - When I was about to check,

477
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,690
she said, "Tanhyeon by 10:40am," and hung up.

478
00:17:31,321 --> 00:17:33,091
- "Tanhyeon by 10:40am." - She said that because...

479
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,621
- she had a gut feeling that he was. - Right. So...

480
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,690
I told her that I might not...

481
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,091
- Here's the next question. - Okay.

482
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,131
- Here's the next question. - Okay.

483
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,371
"What is the reason the crew invites you often?"

484
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,270
- This is your next question. - I wasn't finished.

485
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,341
We don't have time.

486
00:17:48,341 --> 00:17:52,040
- We're moving on to Daniel. - We need to interview Daniel.

487
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,710
(Sae Ho gives up his air time for viewers who are waiting for Daniel.)

488
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,811
We all know that.

489
00:17:55,811 --> 00:17:58,651
- We are moving on. - Okay. We're moving like a train.

490
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:01,151
- Answer questions on your website. - Should we move on or not?

491
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:04,190
- All right. I will. - Say what you want to say there.

492
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,490
All right. Here's our next guest,

493
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,321
Kang Daniel!

494
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:10,020
(This is the interview everyone has been waiting for.)

495
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:12,460
This is Korea, Daniel's motherland!

496
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:15,960
All right. Daniel...

497
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,331
- is the most sought-after star. - Indeed.

498
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,770
Don't you feel the popularity you have garnered these days?

499
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,740
- They support me for my effort. - Exactly.

500
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,911
Jong Kook, as a former idol singer who has been in the industry...

501
00:18:30,911 --> 00:18:32,780
- longer than he has... - Right. I was once an idol.

502
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,351
- He's a living history. - Must he be careful of anything?

503
00:18:35,351 --> 00:18:37,220
- He must be careful of women. - Jong Kook.

504
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:38,891
- Right. - That's so true.

505
00:18:38,891 --> 00:18:40,391
- How could you say that? - He must be careful of them now.

506
00:18:40,391 --> 00:18:41,821
- I mean it. - Goodness.

507
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:44,131
Sa Yeon, what do you think? You've been a singer for a long time too.

508
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,931
Moo Song wasn't careful of women, so he ended up with her.

509
00:18:46,931 --> 00:18:49,161
(He makes a remark out of the blue.)

510
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:52,970
(Unintentionally, she becomes the living sermon of his advice.)

511
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,000
- I said it because we're close. - Hey.

512
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,411
- Moo Song really wants to see you. - No, no.

513
00:18:57,411 --> 00:18:58,671
He said he would like to treat you to a meal.

514
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,540
My apologies.

515
00:19:01,581 --> 00:19:03,280
- At Daniel's age... - We are close friends.

516
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,950
- We really are close friends. - He...

517
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,581
- They really are. - Right now, he's so innocent.

518
00:19:06,581 --> 00:19:09,121
Just like we talked about earlier,

519
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:11,421
- Daniel is incredibly popular. - I agree.

520
00:19:11,421 --> 00:19:13,351
- He's on commercials and shows. - Thank you.

521
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,490
I bet you don't get to sleep a lot these days.

522
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,960
- He's the 1st choice for everyone. - I sleep about 2 or 3 hours.

523
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,490
- You only sleep that little? - Yes.

524
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,730
- Poor you. - How many hours did you sleep?

525
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,601
- I slept for about 12 hours. - 12 hours?

526
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,831
- That's a bit alarming. - I did sleep for 12 hours.

527
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:27,000
- That's not healthy. - Seok Jin.

528
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,470
People might think you're sleeping forever.

529
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,401
I took a nap yesterday and woke up today.

530
00:19:31,611 --> 00:19:33,240
Then that can't be considered napping.

531
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,181
- You slept too much. - Seok Jin.

532
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:37,480
- You should visit the clinic. - That's enough.

533
00:19:37,651 --> 00:19:40,111
- I took a nap, but it was morning. - That happens to people.

534
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:42,921
- But it's too much. Go to a clinic. - Some do sleep that much.

535
00:19:42,921 --> 00:19:45,621
- Get yourself checked out. - Well,

536
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,821
- I should save up when I can. - Hey, let's listen to Daniel.

537
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:50,361
(Everyone, be quiet!)

538
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:51,631
(Every viewer wanted to say the same.)

539
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:53,331
- Anyway, his smile is so pretty. - Right.

540
00:19:53,331 --> 00:19:55,000
- It is very pretty. - All right, Daniel.

541
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,631
- I want to see him dance. - Dance?

542
00:19:56,631 --> 00:19:58,101
- Daniel's dancing? - The move with the thigh.

543
00:19:58,101 --> 00:20:00,940
- I really want to see it. - Daniel, please do the dance.

544
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,540
(Daniel dances for the show.)

545
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,010
- He's an excellent dancer. - This is great.

546
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,641
(He was acting shy, but his attitude suddenly changes.)

547
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:11,651
(His dance moves are fancy as he's the center of Wanna One.)

548
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,881
(Jaw-dropping)

549
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,480
(Everyone including the crew pays him the utmost attention.)

550
00:20:19,321 --> 00:20:21,591
(You pierce into my heart like my destiny)

551
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:24,790
(Open your heart to me)

552
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,800
(The body wave opens the hearts of the female viewers.)

553
00:20:28,901 --> 00:20:31,300
(Their hearts are racing.)

554
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,800
- Do the move with the thigh! - Do the thigh move!

555
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,940
(Stroking)

556
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:42,040
(Daniel, do whatever you want to do!)

557
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:44,450
Stop it. Don't!

558
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,181
Hey, the kids are watching. Stop.

559
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:47,851
- Why are you so red? - Stop it.

560
00:20:47,851 --> 00:20:49,950
- Leave me alone. - No, don't do it!

561
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,550
- Come on, Se Chan. - Stop it.

562
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,561
- Stop scratching your thigh. - Gosh, it's so frustrating.

563
00:20:54,561 --> 00:20:56,561
- You stopped me from dancing. - He was great.

564
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:57,730
Thank you.

565
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,831
Hey, we...

566
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:01,901
When it got hectic,

567
00:21:02,131 --> 00:21:05,431
- Sa Yeon came quietly and hugged... - She hugged him?

568
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,171
(Approaching)

569
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:11,811
(Sa Yeon abruptly approached and hugged him.)

570
00:21:12,111 --> 00:21:14,780
(Goodness, did you see that?)

571
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,980
I saw it.

572
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,851
She is very affectionate towards her junior singers.

573
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:20,921
- I'm his entertainment senior. - I understand.

574
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:22,081
- He's so cute. He just started. - That's right.

575
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,421
- I wanted him to be a good singer. - Thank you.

576
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,361
(Ji Hyo, look at me.)

577
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,591
So Min keeps imitating Daniel's dance.

578
00:21:30,591 --> 00:21:32,490
- What did she do? - Come here, and show them.

579
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,401
- So Min, do your thing. - What is it?

580
00:21:34,401 --> 00:21:37,101
So Min, why don't you dance to the song?

581
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,500
- You should give that a try. - Right. Give it a go.

582
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:41,200
- This is nice. - I didn't mean to.

583
00:21:41,571 --> 00:21:44,641
(This is So Min's cover dance as Daniel demonstrates for her.)

584
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:51,411
(What a surprise! She can pull off a decent body wave.)

585
00:21:55,121 --> 00:21:56,250
Come on!

586
00:21:56,421 --> 00:21:57,520
- Give us a break! - So Min.

587
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,290
Hey, you didn't have to go that far!

588
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
- She always causes trouble. - So Min.

589
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:04,061
- So Min. - I...

590
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:06,760
- I'll keep her with me. - Yes, please.

591
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,730
- Jae Seok. Kwang Soo is ready too. - Really? That's awesome.

592
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,901
- Kwang Soo, you should try. - Kwang Soo.

593
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:12,500
Since you're wearing the jacket, you can pull it off.

594
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,740
- He'd look cool with the dance. - Try it.

595
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,071
Kwang Soo has the longest thighs than anyone here.

596
00:22:17,071 --> 00:22:18,911
- I'll take this seriously then. - Kwang Soo, go all out for it.

597
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:21,111
- When will you ride the spaceship? - The spaceship?

598
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,540
He looks like the skinny version of Don Spike.

599
00:22:24,151 --> 00:22:26,081
He truly does.

600
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:28,381
With the sunglasses, he does look like Don Spike.

601
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,851
- His thighs are not muscular. - It will take long as they're long.

602
00:22:31,421 --> 00:22:32,450
Here it comes.

603
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,550
(Kwang Soo begins dancing.)

604
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,790
Kwang Daniel!

605
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,161
Kwang Daniel!

606
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,460
(Yeon Soo, you're watching, right?)

607
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,730
That's disgusting.

608
00:22:41,901 --> 00:22:44,230
- I told you they were long. - They are long.

609
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,571
His legs are so long.

610
00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:46,931
(A bad output of long legs)

611
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,440
(Open it)

612
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,381
Jae Seok, what are you doing?

613
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:58,780
(Hwang Jung Min of "The Wailing" drives evil spirits of his dance.)

614
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:00,851
(This is the purgatory of dance.)

615
00:23:00,851 --> 00:23:02,651
I can't stand this.

616
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,591
Goodness, that's it.

617
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:07,621
I'm so honored.

618
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:11,131
(Their initiations are over. Which guest will take over the gangs?)

619
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,730
- There are three gangs right now. - Okay.

620
00:23:14,831 --> 00:23:18,431
We will start Fight to Become the Boss, My Boss is in First Place now.

621
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,470
(Fight to Become the Boss, My Boss is in First Place)

622
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:24,841
You will hear the keywords of the boss candidates' best weapon.

623
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,240
If you think you can beat the candidates, you can challenge them.

624
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,311
Through the matches, whoever wins the last match will become the boss.

625
00:23:31,311 --> 00:23:32,681
(Whoever wins the match will become the boss.)

626
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:36,220
Sae Ho will reveal his best weapon.

627
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,391
- What is yours? - He's good at many things.

628
00:23:38,421 --> 00:23:39,450
Will he be dancing?

629
00:23:39,821 --> 00:23:41,591
- Dance? - It's dancing.

630
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:42,760
He's so shameless.

631
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,161
He's the best dancer when Daniel is here?

632
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:47,700
- He can't win with dancing. - There's a hole.

633
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,460
Even the tags are problematic like the owner.

634
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,671
- Why is that? - He's taking up too much time.

635
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:54,200
- Sae Ho, just forget it. - Hold this.

636
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,770
- "The Best Dancer". - "The Best Dancer".

637
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,841
- Will you be okay with this? - This is a stupid move.

638
00:23:58,841 --> 00:24:00,071
You can't follow through.

639
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,240
Daniel joined her today.

640
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,280
- No, Sae Ho isn't a good dancer. - I...

641
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,351
I don't know which song they will play for me.

642
00:24:05,351 --> 00:24:08,881
He's 1 of the 5 best dancers among comedians.

643
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:11,091
- That's true. He's a good dancer. - I didn't expect that.

644
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:12,790
- I'm 1 of the 5 best dancers? - Yes.

645
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,690
- He didn't know. - Shall I start now?

646
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,520
- He's 1 of the 5 dancers. - He didn't know.

647
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,091
Since he said we could play any song,

648
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:19,990
- we prepared random songs. - Sure.

649
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,530
All right. Let's watch his dance.

650
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,061
Sae Ho, you can do it.

651
00:24:23,901 --> 00:24:25,371
I wonder what kind of music they will play.

652
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
Goodness.

653
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,000
(Oh, gosh. What is this?)

654
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,181
- See? He can dance to every song. - He wasn't flustered.

655
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:37,450
He can practically dance to every song.

656
00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:39,151
That was a nice turn.

657
00:24:39,151 --> 00:24:40,351
- Goodness. - That was great.

658
00:24:40,351 --> 00:24:41,720
- That suits him. - He's adorable!

659
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:44,651
- The dance suits him. - He's so cute.

660
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,421
(Unbelievable. He can actually pull this off.)

661
00:24:52,931 --> 00:24:54,700
(He imitates a monkey.)

662
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,200
That's it. You must come back.

663
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,671
- There you go. - What is that elephant move?

664
00:24:58,171 --> 00:24:59,371
(Dancing like an elephant)

665
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:01,300
(Tooting)

666
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,101
You all saw that, right?

667
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,071
- You saw what he did, didn't you? - He really is a good dancer.

668
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,841
- That was so cool. - Goodness.

669
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:08,911
- The song surprised me. - That was groovy.

670
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,480
- Who's next? Yeon Soo? - Yeon Soo should go next.

671
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,250
- Yeon Soo. - I can't.

672
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:15,081
- Yeon Soo might be an underdog. - That's right.

673
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:16,681
- I'm so curious. - That suits you well.

674
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,550
- You can win with your cuteness. - Yes, I'm a bit hot.

675
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,821
- Play the song. - What should I do?

676
00:25:20,621 --> 00:25:22,561
- Here it is! - Let's go!

677
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,530
(Her eyes undergo a sudden change.)

678
00:25:30,601 --> 00:25:34,440
(A monkey climbs up the tree)

679
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,970
- That's great. - Great.

680
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,040
(Tossing her hair)

681
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,371
(She's engrossed in dancing.)

682
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,581
Nice!

683
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,040
(Yes! This is my chance.)

684
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,921
(A giant octopus appeals his charms to her.)

685
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,020
(Doing her best)

686
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,561
Monkey, monkey magic, monkey magic

687
00:25:54,561 --> 00:25:57,161
(She doesn't lose focus despite the distraction.)

688
00:25:57,161 --> 00:25:58,891
All right. Both of you...

689
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,730
- You were so good. - That was excellent.

690
00:26:00,831 --> 00:26:02,030
She lost herself in her dance.

691
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,631
- That was great. - I liked that.

692
00:26:03,661 --> 00:26:06,101
- Really? You did? - Yes, I did like it.

693
00:26:06,101 --> 00:26:07,401
- You did well. - All right.

694
00:26:07,571 --> 00:26:09,800
The rest of you will decide who the winner is.

695
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,470
- Next up is... - Yes, go, Ma Jong Kook!

696
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,571
It's not that...

697
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,040
- Jong Kook. - Goodness.

698
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,381
He's warming up.

699
00:26:16,381 --> 00:26:18,550
(Feeling shy)

700
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,480
It's the shark song.

701
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,280
It's the shark song.

702
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,220
(His muscles do the wave.)

703
00:26:29,391 --> 00:26:32,490
(Feeling narcissistic)

704
00:26:34,561 --> 00:26:35,960
Please switch the song.

705
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,030
- My kid loves this song. - Let's change the song.

706
00:26:38,101 --> 00:26:39,171
(The theme song of "National Singing Contest")

707
00:26:39,171 --> 00:26:40,700
- What is this? - It's "National Singing Contest".

708
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,871
Hey, this is...

709
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,440
(He wriggles his body again.)

710
00:26:49,581 --> 00:26:51,881
Do a cute dance move.

711
00:26:51,881 --> 00:26:53,280
(Officer, you can't do that here.)

712
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,520
- But... - Why am I feeling hot?

713
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,490
don't you think he has guns all over his body?

714
00:26:58,591 --> 00:26:59,891
I have a gun here.

715
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,561
- He does. - He has guns in his biceps.

716
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,960
I'm going to take out my guns.

717
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,891
All right, everyone.

718
00:27:06,131 --> 00:27:08,500
- Let's see Daniel's moves. - Let's go, Daniel.

719
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,770
He's one of the strongest boss candidates.

720
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,931
(Daniel enters the stage.)

721
00:27:16,071 --> 00:27:17,111
Here we go.

722
00:27:24,681 --> 00:27:26,851
(Oh, my.)

723
00:27:27,851 --> 00:27:28,921
(Are you watching?)

724
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:30,490
He's so well prepared.

725
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,351
Amazing.

726
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:33,391
(His sense of rhythm is incredible.)

727
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,990
Please change the music.

728
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,131
(He finishes off relaxedly.)

729
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,500
(Second song)

730
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,270
You can do this.

731
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,540
(He's getting into the rhythm.)

732
00:27:50,341 --> 00:27:51,470
(This is not good.)

733
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,371
- He is really good. - He's so cute.

734
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:54,710
How can you do this?

735
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,710
(I'm the king of dance.)

736
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,111
He's amazing.

737
00:27:57,151 --> 00:27:58,411
Oh, my.

738
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:00,750
- This is embarrassing. - You did an amazing job.

739
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,621
Even his freestyle dance is amazing.

740
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,351
This is embarrassing.

741
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,790
- His freestyle dance is so nice. - I'm so embarrassed.

742
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,520
- It was fantastic. - You're cruel.

743
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,091
- No. - Amazing job.

744
00:28:10,091 --> 00:28:12,631
Daniel wins.

745
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,030
Thank you.

746
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,730
I accept the result.

747
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,300
- I respect the result. - Then...

748
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,431
Daniel can choose which team he wants to join.

749
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:21,970
We're...

750
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,040
- Are you here alone? - Okay.

751
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,171
You'll have to dress similarly to the other team members.

752
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,980
- Really? - You have to.

753
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,040
Okay.

754
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,081
Daniel can have my hairstyle.

755
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,550
- My wig... - Daniel can wear my wig.

756
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,581
- This jacket is too warm. - It's so hot.

757
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:37,591
(I'll donate my jacket.)

758
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,020
This is much better.

759
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,290
I didn't know what the weather would be like in Korea.

760
00:28:41,361 --> 00:28:44,431
(Nose Tae thought it'd be hot in Korea.)

761
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,760
He's good.

762
00:28:45,831 --> 00:28:47,131
(What is he doing?)

763
00:28:47,431 --> 00:28:49,101
He's good.

764
00:28:49,101 --> 00:28:50,730
It's not hot in Yanbian.

765
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,371
- That's a Gangwon dialect. - That's a Gyeongsang dialect.

766
00:28:54,371 --> 00:28:55,800
Where are you from?

767
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,411
Due to global warming...

768
00:28:58,171 --> 00:28:59,940
Global warming is getting serious.

769
00:29:00,411 --> 00:29:01,710
- Daniel. - Yes.

770
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,440
- Please choose a team. - You can dress like a detective.

771
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,881
- It'll look cool. - We're Mungdol Gang.

772
00:29:04,881 --> 00:29:05,911
Mungdol Gang.

773
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:06,911
- Mungdol Gang. - You're?

774
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,050
Team Police.

775
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,181
(A real man should join Team Police.)

776
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:11,651
- Which team do you choose? - Well...

777
00:29:11,651 --> 00:29:16,921
(All teams want Daniel. Where will he go?)

778
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:20,131
(All teams want Daniel. Where will he go?)

779
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:21,260
Mungdol Gang.

780
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,530
Really?

781
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:24,931
(Daniel chooses Mungdol Gang.)

782
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:27,000
- That's clever. - All right.

783
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,470
Whose turn is it now?

784
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,240
- It's Yeon Soo's turn. - Yeon Soo.

785
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,270
(It's Yeon Soo's turn.)

786
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,171
- Let's take a look. - What is she good at?

787
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:34,641
Being cute?

788
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:36,740
- Smile? - Smile?

789
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,250
I have a nice smile.

790
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:42,681
(Best Smiler)

791
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:44,591
Among us,

792
00:29:44,591 --> 00:29:46,250
the only ones who have a chance are...

793
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,661
So Min and Ji Hyo.

794
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,561
- I have a nice smile too. - Show us.

795
00:29:49,561 --> 00:29:50,831
(I have a nice smile.)

796
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:51,861
(His smile could...)

797
00:29:51,861 --> 00:29:53,960
(literally kill a person.)

798
00:29:54,331 --> 00:29:56,331
- You see... - Oh, I recognize that smile.

799
00:29:56,331 --> 00:29:58,000
He does this all the time.

800
00:29:58,401 --> 00:29:59,871
When did I do that?

801
00:29:59,871 --> 00:30:01,071
- Like this. - I never do that.

802
00:30:01,071 --> 00:30:02,841
You do this.

803
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,681
(He looks the same in every picture.)

804
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,010
I don't do that.

805
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,311
It doesn't look like that.

806
00:30:10,881 --> 00:30:11,950
No, no.

807
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,581
It'd be hard to decide...

808
00:30:13,581 --> 00:30:15,980
which smile looks the best.

809
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,190
How are you going to judge?

810
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,851
You'll be flicked in the forehead while smiling.

811
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,220
(They'll be flicked in the forehead.)

812
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,591
After the flick,

813
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:26,490
you have to keep a smile for five seconds.

814
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,131
We can't flick Yeon Soo in the forehead.

815
00:30:28,131 --> 00:30:29,200
(They have to keep a smile for 5 seconds.)

816
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:33,000
- Kwang Soo doesn't care. - No.

817
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,101
- He's fair to everyone. - It's just a game.

818
00:30:34,101 --> 00:30:35,470
Of course.

819
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,071
It's going to hurt.

820
00:30:37,071 --> 00:30:38,240
Definitely.

821
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:39,940
- I'll start. - Keep a smile.

822
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,841
That's going to hurt.

823
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:43,240
You have to keep this smile.

824
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,611
- Yeon Soo. - I'm scared.

825
00:30:44,611 --> 00:30:46,311
You're already frowning.

826
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,980
(You're already moving.)

827
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,181
His hand is so big. It's scary.

828
00:30:51,621 --> 00:30:52,621
Then you'll fail.

829
00:30:52,621 --> 00:30:53,821
- Yeon Soo. - Yes?

830
00:30:53,821 --> 00:30:56,161
- Are you ready? - Can't I just give up?

831
00:30:58,331 --> 00:30:59,391
(I suddenly want to give up.)

832
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,431
- You can't. - It was your idea.

833
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,530
Wait.

834
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,770
(He's having a hard time managing his anger.)

835
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:05,770
Why are you so angry?

836
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,270
- What are you doing? - Why are you angry?

837
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,470
Why are you so angry?

838
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,940
Are you drunk?

839
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,970
What's with you?

840
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,141
It was your idea.

841
00:31:12,141 --> 00:31:13,540
Please smile.

842
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,911
(Take a deep breath...)

843
00:31:15,911 --> 00:31:19,280
(and smile.)

844
00:31:19,851 --> 00:31:21,780
(She's so pretty.)

845
00:31:23,851 --> 00:31:24,891
I'll start.

846
00:31:24,891 --> 00:31:25,990
(Kwang Soo gets ready.)

847
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,220
(Flicking)

848
00:31:30,631 --> 00:31:33,800
(I have to keep a smile.)

849
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,230
Isn't this just how she usually looks?

850
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,601
- This is just how her face looks. - She looks like this all the time.

851
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,470
(Poker face)

852
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,540
She's good.

853
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,300
- It hurts. - Does it hurt?

854
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,411
Yes.

855
00:31:44,411 --> 00:31:46,311
(She kept a smile for 5 seconds.)

856
00:31:47,841 --> 00:31:49,681
- So Min. - She'll pull it off.

857
00:31:49,681 --> 00:31:50,750
(The first contestant is So Min.)

858
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,780
Seriously.

859
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:53,651
Put on a smile.

860
00:31:53,651 --> 00:31:54,821
Show us.

861
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:55,821
Cameras, please...

862
00:31:55,821 --> 00:31:57,020
Yeon Soo, can you come over here?

863
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,591
- Please smile. - Keep it for five seconds.

864
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,361
- Yeon Soo. - Please come here.

865
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:02,421
You're in the way.

866
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:03,990
I thought she was a viewer.

867
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:05,790
- Please stand here. - She wants to see.

868
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,260
Show us your smile.

869
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,800
- Like this? - Like this?

870
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,931
You look pretty.

871
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,270
That looks nice.

872
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,500
You're doing great.

873
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,841
With your hands covering your face.

874
00:32:15,841 --> 00:32:16,841
(She decides on her smile.)

875
00:32:17,641 --> 00:32:20,010
(Flicking)

876
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,780
(Her smile is gone.)

877
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,450
Wait.

878
00:32:26,581 --> 00:32:28,181
Hold on.

879
00:32:28,181 --> 00:32:29,351
That fast?

880
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,020
You fail.

881
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,861
- So Min failed. - I was smiling.

882
00:32:34,861 --> 00:32:35,960
So Min failed.

883
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,990
- So Min. - You should try too.

884
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,260
- So Min failed. - You should try too.

885
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,960
You should try.

886
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,901
- You should. - Try, Kwang Soo.

887
00:32:43,901 --> 00:32:45,230
(Kwang Soo gives it a try.)

888
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,371
Please smile.

889
00:32:46,371 --> 00:32:47,641
That looks good.

890
00:32:47,641 --> 00:32:48,770
There you go.

891
00:32:49,071 --> 00:32:50,141
That disgusting smile again.

892
00:32:50,141 --> 00:32:51,171
(Prince of Asia's smile)

893
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:53,371
- Please face the camera. - It won't hurt.

894
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:54,480
(So Min will flick him in the forehead.)

895
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,351
It won't hurt.

896
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:58,851
(Punching)

897
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,450
(You come here.)

898
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,561
(An eye for an eye.)

899
00:33:07,561 --> 00:33:09,561
- You're crazy. - So Min.

900
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:10,931
Kwang Soo failed.

901
00:33:10,931 --> 00:33:12,931
He failed.

902
00:33:12,931 --> 00:33:14,500
She punched me.

903
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,030
His forehead is red.

904
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,171
(He was punched.)

905
00:33:17,171 --> 00:33:18,270
It's red.

906
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,300
(Kwang Soo fails.)

907
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,800
- No one has done this before. - Kwang Soo failed.

908
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,770
(He's no longer the Prince of Asia.)

909
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:26,440
Now...

910
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,641
(The next contestant is...)

911
00:33:27,641 --> 00:33:29,440
(Is it me?)

912
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,750
It's not your turn yet. You don't have to get ready.

913
00:33:34,121 --> 00:33:35,181
(It isn't?)

914
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:36,851
He wants a close-up shot.

915
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,421
He wants a close-up shot.

916
00:33:39,421 --> 00:33:40,490
It's not my turn yet?

917
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,490
He's been...

918
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:48,500
(He's been getting ready for a close-up shot.)

919
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,300
- Then... - Why doesn't Sae Ho try?

920
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,800
- I'm okay. - Give it a try.

921
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,000
Well...

922
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,841
Can't I choose not to?

923
00:33:57,841 --> 00:34:00,440
Eun Kyung and your manager have agreed on this.

924
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,681
They have?

925
00:34:01,681 --> 00:34:03,311
Se Chan will flick him in the forehead.

926
00:34:03,311 --> 00:34:04,780
All right.

927
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,851
- Are you ready? - Yes.

928
00:34:05,851 --> 00:34:06,950
Please put on a smile.

929
00:34:07,351 --> 00:34:09,550
- Like this? - Yes.

930
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,621
(Se Chan is the strongest one.)

931
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:13,090
Here we go.

932
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:15,461
(Flicking)

933
00:34:17,961 --> 00:34:20,961
(He gets teary-eyed.)

934
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:26,200
(His eyes are crying.)

935
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,240
What is this?

936
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,300
He looks a bit different.

937
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,441
(Sae Ho fails.)

938
00:34:32,441 --> 00:34:33,470
He failed.

939
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:37,251
Daniel should try.

940
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:38,880
- Okay. - Daniel should try.

941
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,911
Okay.

942
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,550
Se Chan should flick him.

943
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,280
- Se Chan is strong. - Will you be okay?

944
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,990
- I'll try. - Are you sure?

945
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,291
- Will I be okay? - I'll try.

946
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,461
- Will I be okay? - Don't worry. It's just a game.

947
00:34:49,461 --> 00:34:51,130
- Are you sure? - Of course.

948
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,990
- Of course. - You're a professional.

949
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,661
- Sure. - Daniel,

950
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,200
please show us your smile.

951
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,731
- Show us a few. - Show us your favorite ones.

952
00:34:57,731 --> 00:34:59,501
1, 2, 3.

953
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,740
(Cute)

954
00:35:02,371 --> 00:35:04,041
- He's so cute. - He's so cute.

955
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:05,670
(Their hearts flutter.)

956
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,141
A bigger smile, please.

957
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,041
(Winking)

958
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,851
That looks great. Please keep that one.

959
00:35:11,851 --> 00:35:13,351
Wink. I love that.

960
00:35:13,351 --> 00:35:14,420
(Everyone is in love.)

961
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,150
Here we go.

962
00:35:17,891 --> 00:35:19,090
Se Chan is strong.

963
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,251
(Flick)

964
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,621
Hey.

965
00:35:23,931 --> 00:35:24,990
(Crying)

966
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,291
You're...

967
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:29,700
I'm sorry. It was just a game!

968
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:31,331
It was just a game!

969
00:35:31,831 --> 00:35:33,800
It's just a game!

970
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,570
Attack him!

971
00:35:37,441 --> 00:35:38,740
It's just a game!

972
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,811
(Daniel fails.)

973
00:35:40,811 --> 00:35:43,950
- You're the star of the night - No!

974
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:49,820
(He closed both eyes.)

975
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,720
(Are you okay?)

976
00:35:53,621 --> 00:35:57,691
Yeon Soo kept a smile.

977
00:35:57,691 --> 00:36:00,231
She's the boss.

978
00:36:00,231 --> 00:36:01,831
(Yeon Soo becomes a boss.)

979
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,831
Please choose a team.

980
00:36:03,831 --> 00:36:06,101
(She has to choose a team.)

981
00:36:06,101 --> 00:36:07,501
Are you here alone?

982
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:09,641
(She has to dress like the other team members.)

983
00:36:09,641 --> 00:36:11,470
Will I have to dress like that?

984
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,641
- Yes. - It's embarrassing at first,

985
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:15,541
but you get used to it. It's quite comfortable.

986
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:19,880
I saw the other wig back there. It's a Chinese queue.

987
00:36:20,621 --> 00:36:22,081
- No. - What?

988
00:36:22,121 --> 00:36:23,420
It isn't.

989
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,650
- It isn't. - What are you talking about?

990
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,590
You wear it the other way around.

991
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:28,391
It's a Chinese queue.

992
00:36:28,961 --> 00:36:29,990
Are you choosing us?

993
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,461
- Are you? - Yes!

994
00:36:31,461 --> 00:36:32,891
(Yeon Soo chooses Team Police.)

995
00:36:34,601 --> 00:36:37,601
- Is it Sa Yeon's turn now? - Yes.

996
00:36:37,601 --> 00:36:39,771
Sa Yeon's specialty is...

997
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,070
- Strength? - Her specialty is strength.

998
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:43,840
She's really strong.

999
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,740
She's incredible.

1000
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:49,280
She suppressed Seok Jin with force earlier today.

1001
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,581
I touched her arms,

1002
00:36:50,581 --> 00:36:52,380
and they were hard like Jong Kook's.

1003
00:36:52,681 --> 00:36:54,351
(Her arms were hard like Jong Kook's.)

1004
00:36:54,581 --> 00:36:55,981
- She's really strong. - She is.

1005
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:57,191
(Sa Yeon has extraordinary arm strength.)

1006
00:36:57,891 --> 00:37:02,220
(No one can beat her in Wrist Wrestling.)

1007
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:06,161
We'll play Wrist Wrestling.

1008
00:37:06,161 --> 00:37:07,200
(Wrist Wrestling is her specialty.)

1009
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,231
Wrist Wrestling.

1010
00:37:08,231 --> 00:37:09,260
(Bring it on.)

1011
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,831
If your feet get off the ground,

1012
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:13,530
you'll lose.

1013
00:37:13,771 --> 00:37:19,541
If Sa Yeon defeats all female members, she remains first place.

1014
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:22,141
(She remains 1st place if she defeats the females.)

1015
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,711
(Round 1 is Sa Yeon versus So Min.)

1016
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,780
- Push her to the side. - To the side.

1017
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,650
Do I push her to the side?

1018
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:32,251
You can't throw her around back and forth.

1019
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:34,320
(Be gentle with her.)

1020
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:36,820
- I'll try to win. - Okay.

1021
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,831
Get ready.

1022
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,931
Start.

1023
00:37:39,931 --> 00:37:41,760
(Sa Yeon and So Min start.)

1024
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,030
Sa Yeon doesn't budge at all.

1025
00:37:43,331 --> 00:37:46,170
(She attacks her with all her might.)

1026
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,970
Sa Yeon doesn't budge at all.

1027
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:51,311
(She stands firmly.)

1028
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:52,311
She's so strong.

1029
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:54,041
Goodness.

1030
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:57,950
(She easily pushes So Min off to the side.)

1031
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,550
Hold on.

1032
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,550
People don't usually fly off.

1033
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,450
They don't usually fly off while playing Wrist Wrestling.

1034
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,050
She seems like a 100-year-old zelkova tree.

1035
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,920
(She's not human.)

1036
00:38:11,061 --> 00:38:13,831
How can you say that she's 100 years old?

1037
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,601
She has strong roots.

1038
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:17,530
Regular wrestling is better.

1039
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:20,970
She's described as a 100-year-old zelkova tree.

1040
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,340
She's deeply rooted.

1041
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,541
Next up is Yeon Soo.

1042
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:25,010
- You can do it. - Let's go.

1043
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,340
(Round 2 is Sa Yeon versus Yeon Soo.)

1044
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,441
Let's go.

1045
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:28,711
(Round 2 is Sa Yeon versus Yeon Soo.)

1046
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:32,251
What if I lose within one second?

1047
00:38:32,251 --> 00:38:33,851
You never know.

1048
00:38:33,851 --> 00:38:35,481
It's hard to tell.

1049
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,550
All you need is technique.

1050
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,251
- She's very determined. - Start.

1051
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:40,720
(Sa Yeon and Yeon Soo start.)

1052
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,791
That's good.

1053
00:38:42,121 --> 00:38:43,121
Start.

1054
00:38:43,831 --> 00:38:45,530
- How is she not budging? - She puts weight on one side.

1055
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,860
That's right.

1056
00:38:46,961 --> 00:38:48,400
- She puts weight on one side. - Right.

1057
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,561
She knows how to play it.

1058
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,200
Yeon Soo knows how to play it.

1059
00:38:51,931 --> 00:38:53,130
She knows how to play it.

1060
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:56,041
(Does she know how to play it? I don't think so.)

1061
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:57,041
Goodness.

1062
00:38:57,041 --> 00:39:00,340
(She falls flat on the floor.)

1063
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,280
Yeon Soo.

1064
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:04,851
Are your feet nailed to the ground?

1065
00:39:04,851 --> 00:39:07,181
(Could that be her secret?)

1066
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:09,320
She doesn't move at all.

1067
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,691
- I know. - You're invincible.

1068
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:12,820
She doesn't budge.

1069
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,920
She's like a 100-year-old zelkova tree.

1070
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,231
(Her weight is impressive.)

1071
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,731
Next is Ji Hyo.

1072
00:39:21,731 --> 00:39:23,331
Let's go, Ji Hyo.

1073
00:39:23,331 --> 00:39:26,070
- By the way... - It's hard to defeat Sa Yeon.

1074
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,041
Ji Hyo is strong and tough.

1075
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:30,510
Once, she grabbed my arm.

1076
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:33,371
My knees went weak. I apologized to her.

1077
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:38,050
Sa Yeon is able to play with her ring on.

1078
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,050
(She even has her ring on.)

1079
00:39:41,351 --> 00:39:42,521
She has her ring on.

1080
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:44,420
(It represents how confident she is.)

1081
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,090
- You should take it off. - Most people...

1082
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:49,490
take off their diamond rings before playing.

1083
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:51,291
Sa Yeon is different.

1084
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:52,661
It's rare to see diamonds on variety shows.

1085
00:39:52,661 --> 00:39:54,300
Get ready, set, go.

1086
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,771
- Isn't Ji Hyo different? - Isn't she?

1087
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:01,400
- Isn't it different this time? - What's going on?

1088
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,141
(Once she defeats Ji Hyo, Sa Yeon will be in 1st place.)

1089
00:40:04,871 --> 00:40:09,411
(It won't be so easy, Sa Yeon.)

1090
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:14,780
(As expected, Ji Hyo falls on the mat.)

1091
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,791
I really respect you.

1092
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,391
- Respect, respect. - Goodness.

1093
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:24,130
She pushed everyone as far as 30cm.

1094
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,291
(Seok Jin steps in.)

1095
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,760
Seriously.

1096
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,300
(Are you that strong, Sa Yeon?)

1097
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,331
They fell over here.

1098
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:33,231
(Nose Tae is curious about Sa Yeon's strength.)

1099
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:34,800
- What's going on? - Come here.

1100
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,670
Come here.

1101
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,670
- Jong Kook, why don't you... - Yes?

1102
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,340
- play against Seok Jin? - Come here.

1103
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,911
(Come here, Seok Jin.)

1104
00:40:42,181 --> 00:40:44,711
- That won't work. - Come over here.

1105
00:40:44,711 --> 00:40:47,621
(He has no business with Jong Kook.)

1106
00:40:48,081 --> 00:40:50,121
Come on, Seok Jin.

1107
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,490
You're already here, so let's play.

1108
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:54,191
I can't play against him.

1109
00:40:54,961 --> 00:40:57,161
- All right. - Wait, come this way.

1110
00:40:57,161 --> 00:40:58,691
- Okay. - We should start here.

1111
00:40:58,731 --> 00:41:00,030
Seok Jin is serious.

1112
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,831
(Why is he so serious?)

1113
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:02,831
Start.

1114
00:41:02,831 --> 00:41:03,900
(Jong Kook and Nose Tae start.)

1115
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,041
(As soon as they start, Seok Jin loses.)

1116
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:09,041
You go.

1117
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,541
- Kwang Soo, you're up next. - No.

1118
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:17,010
Nose Tae, step out. Kwang Soo, it's your turn.

1119
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:21,121
- Play. - Take revenge, Kwang Soo.

1120
00:41:21,851 --> 00:41:22,981
Kwang Soo is strong.

1121
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,521
Start.

1122
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:26,550
Pull him inward. Gosh.

1123
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,291
Darn it.

1124
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:30,291
(He falls as soon as they start.)

1125
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,530
- He fell. Come out. - Bring it on.

1126
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,700
Jae Seok.

1127
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,161
(Please take revenge on him.)

1128
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,001
- Are you alone? - Jae Seok.

1129
00:41:38,771 --> 00:41:41,670
- What's your name? - You're strong, aren't you?

1130
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,470
Start.

1131
00:41:44,441 --> 00:41:45,541
(Jong Kook thrusts him.)

1132
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:46,541
How did you fall that way?

1133
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:48,240
(Jong Kook thrusts him.)

1134
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,880
(How did he end up on the opposite side?)

1135
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,751
- Gosh. - How can you fall to that side?

1136
00:41:51,751 --> 00:41:54,351
- That was pathetic. - Jae Seok is embarrassed.

1137
00:41:54,351 --> 00:41:56,150
He practically flew off.

1138
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,891
Jong Kook, this is impossible.

1139
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,220
Okay.

1140
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:02,791
- All right. - You lost already.

1141
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,391
You lost already.

1142
00:42:04,391 --> 00:42:06,431
- That won't be aired. - You fell here.

1143
00:42:06,431 --> 00:42:08,661
- You lost already. - It won't be aired.

1144
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,831
(We don't remove interesting bits.)

1145
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,400
- Start with taking off the jacket. - Don't start again.

1146
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,840
- I was... - Here I am.

1147
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,900
(Shall we start again?)

1148
00:42:16,441 --> 00:42:17,941
- This is impossible. - Right.

1149
00:42:17,941 --> 00:42:19,771
- This is good. - Are you alone?

1150
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,411
What's your name?

1151
00:42:21,411 --> 00:42:23,851
Gosh, you're strong.

1152
00:42:23,851 --> 00:42:25,150
(He will show the strength of his gang.)

1153
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,021
- You're strong. - Be careful, Jae Seok.

1154
00:42:28,621 --> 00:42:30,751
He'll fall forward. See?

1155
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:32,550
- Come here. - Didn't it happen before?

1156
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,420
I'm sorry. I started too early.

1157
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,161
(He goes back.)

1158
00:42:36,661 --> 00:42:38,431
Seriously.

1159
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,431
(He pretends like nothing happened.)

1160
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,601
Hey.

1161
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,431
- "Are you alone?" - Are you alone?

1162
00:42:43,431 --> 00:42:45,630
- Yes. - What's your name?

1163
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,400
Is he Doctor Strange?

1164
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,070
Doctor Strange?

1165
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:53,811
(Jae Seok keeps turning back the time for Wrist Wrestling.)

1166
00:42:53,981 --> 00:42:56,141
- Here. - It repeats infinitely.

1167
00:42:56,141 --> 00:42:58,450
- Stop it. - Wait.

1168
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,920
If you don't stop, you will die, Jae Seok.

1169
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:03,351
He reminds me of my great-aunt.

1170
00:43:03,351 --> 00:43:05,450
(He looks like his great-aunt from the back.)

1171
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,021
He looks very similar to my great-aunt.

1172
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,590
I feel so bad. Please stop, Jae Seok.

1173
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:11,291
His great-aunt?

1174
00:43:11,791 --> 00:43:13,931
- Please stop, Jae Seok. - That was great.

1175
00:43:13,931 --> 00:43:15,161
(He fails to take revenge.)

1176
00:43:15,161 --> 00:43:16,161
It doesn't work.

1177
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,731
(Sae Ho volunteers.)

1178
00:43:18,731 --> 00:43:19,771
Sae Ho.

1179
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,740
Sae Ho is going next. Let me tell you beforehand.

1180
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:27,441
He comes from a family of strong men.

1181
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:29,541
(Everyone probably didn't know.)

1182
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:30,610
What?

1183
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:33,411
Sae Ho's family became rich because...

1184
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,521
they won oxen from wrestling.

1185
00:43:35,521 --> 00:43:37,621
(His family won oxen.)

1186
00:43:37,621 --> 00:43:39,720
- Is that so? - They won oxen from wrestling.

1187
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,420
He comes from a family of strong men.

1188
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,920
- I see. - Yes.

1189
00:43:43,391 --> 00:43:44,431
- Yes. - My family?

1190
00:43:44,431 --> 00:43:45,530
- Yes. - Really?

1191
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,260
- Listen, Sae Ho. - If you bring up oxen,

1192
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,661
my father will get flustered.

1193
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:51,731
(The topic of oxen makes his father flustered.)

1194
00:43:51,731 --> 00:43:54,041
My father was very flustered after watching Running Man.

1195
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,601
He said, "Are we a family of strong men?"

1196
00:43:57,041 --> 00:43:59,610
- "What do you say to other people?" - Stop it.

1197
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,550
- Go to the center. - He has a good sense of balance.

1198
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:07,950
This game isn't about strength.

1199
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,251
- It requires technique. - Right.

1200
00:44:09,251 --> 00:44:13,050
(He's determined to change the reputation of his family.)

1201
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,121
Sae Ho will do well.

1202
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:15,621
(He's determined to change the reputation of his family.)

1203
00:44:16,461 --> 00:44:18,530
- Get ready, set, go. - Let's go.

1204
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,931
(Will he defeat Jong Kook?)

1205
00:44:20,931 --> 00:44:22,831
(They're neck and neck.)

1206
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,130
He's hanging on.

1207
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:28,871
(Sae Ho holds out quite well.)

1208
00:44:28,871 --> 00:44:31,510
(I'll show you the strength of my family.)

1209
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:34,240
(He falls.)

1210
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,711
What's the point of having a strong family?

1211
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,780
(He fails to prove the strength of his family.)

1212
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,081
He's incredible.

1213
00:44:39,181 --> 00:44:41,150
Daniel, give it a try.

1214
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:44,090
- Right, Daniel is strong. - He looks great.

1215
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:46,521
- Daniel, try it. - It's an experience.

1216
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:49,320
(He decides to try Wrist Wrestling.)

1217
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,990
I can't do this to Daniel.

1218
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:53,630
Jong Kook.

1219
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:54,931
(You should be gentle with him.)

1220
00:44:55,931 --> 00:44:56,931
Start.

1221
00:44:56,931 --> 00:44:57,931
(He plays gentle.)

1222
00:44:57,931 --> 00:44:58,931
Goodness.

1223
00:44:59,931 --> 00:45:02,400
(He fails to control his strength.)

1224
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:04,141
- Are you okay? - Try it again.

1225
00:45:04,141 --> 00:45:05,670
- Attack him. - Are you okay, Daniel?

1226
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,211
- Are you okay? - Try it again.

1227
00:45:08,681 --> 00:45:10,211
I can't do it.

1228
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,351
You should let him resist for five seconds.

1229
00:45:12,351 --> 00:45:13,510
That's interesting.

1230
00:45:14,121 --> 00:45:16,920
(I'm sorry. Please understand me.)

1231
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:21,220
As a result, Sa Yeon is first place.

1232
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,691
(She gets to choose her gang.)

1233
00:45:22,691 --> 00:45:25,661
- I'm sorry, but that's my jacket. - Is that so?

1234
00:45:25,661 --> 00:45:28,360
I need a jacket too.

1235
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,161
I can't wear it. It's too hot.

1236
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:31,871
It's incredibly thick.

1237
00:45:31,871 --> 00:45:34,300
(What kind of jacket is this?)

1238
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,840
It keeps in a lot of heat.

1239
00:45:37,641 --> 00:45:39,070
(It must be very hot.)

1240
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,441
There are buttons...

1241
00:45:42,041 --> 00:45:43,441
- in the front. - Be careful.

1242
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:44,550
(Bosses and their teams)

1243
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:47,181
Teams are determined now.

1244
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:51,550
Daniel brought three types of weapons.

1245
00:45:52,191 --> 00:45:53,220
He has three?

1246
00:45:54,121 --> 00:45:55,820
The team to win...

1247
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,331
the most weapons will receive 200 dollars.

1248
00:45:58,331 --> 00:45:59,731
- 200 dollars? - That's great.

1249
00:45:59,731 --> 00:46:00,760
Yes.

1250
00:46:01,431 --> 00:46:03,200
What did you bring, Daniel?

1251
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,570
As a new member, I worked hard to prepare them.

1252
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,070
- It's Sweet Words in a Dialect. - Sae Ho can play Spinning in Place.

1253
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:12,871
- What's Four Leg Run? - This is difficult.

1254
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:13,911
It's hard.

1255
00:46:13,911 --> 00:46:15,740
How do we play Sweet Words in a Dialect?

1256
00:46:16,311 --> 00:46:18,880
You say sweet words while speaking...

1257
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,150
in a dialect.

1258
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,420
- Women like them. - We must come up with words.

1259
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,251
- Okay. - How about this?

1260
00:46:24,521 --> 00:46:26,791
Starting with Sae Ho, let's play 1 by 1.

1261
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:28,820
- Okay. - Say them to Yeon Soo.

1262
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:29,820
I'll say them to Yeon Soo.

1263
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,231
Without any bias,

1264
00:46:32,231 --> 00:46:35,001
- speak whatever is on your mind. - Okay.

1265
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,030
Start.

1266
00:46:36,661 --> 00:46:41,070
(A man in a leather jacket walks with a macho gait.)

1267
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:46,411
(What sweet words will he say to Yeon Soo?)

1268
00:46:46,411 --> 00:46:50,510
(He fails already.)

1269
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,181
You should walk slowly.

1270
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,050
- Walk slowly. - The way you walked...

1271
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:57,220
The way you walked...

1272
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:59,851
I'm about to speak in Gyeongsang dialect.

1273
00:46:59,851 --> 00:47:01,891
However, when you walk...

1274
00:47:01,891 --> 00:47:03,391
- you should be gentler. - I'm from Gumi.

1275
00:47:03,391 --> 00:47:05,391
(He fails again.)

1276
00:47:05,791 --> 00:47:08,200
That's the wrong way to say it.

1277
00:47:08,231 --> 00:47:09,831
- That's not it. - Okay.

1278
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:12,530
- Try it, Se Chan. To Yeon Soo. - To Yeon Soo?

1279
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:14,170
- Can I do it with Yeon Soo? - Sure.

1280
00:47:14,601 --> 00:47:18,070
I'll play a sharp guy.

1281
00:47:18,771 --> 00:47:21,081
- I'll play a sharp guy. - All right.

1282
00:47:21,081 --> 00:47:22,411
(I'll steal Yeon Soo's heart.)

1283
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:24,081
Hey.

1284
00:47:24,081 --> 00:47:26,510
(Hey)

1285
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,920
(He starts off with "Hey.")

1286
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,291
(Will it win Yeon Soo's heart?)

1287
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:34,860
What a pretty face.

1288
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:35,961
Hey.

1289
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:37,661
(What a pretty face.)

1290
00:47:37,661 --> 00:47:39,030
What?

1291
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:40,231
What's wrong?

1292
00:47:40,231 --> 00:47:42,760
I mean...

1293
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,831
- What's wrong? - That doesn't work.

1294
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:46,601
Why?

1295
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:47,840
You failed.

1296
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:50,911
It was rude of you.

1297
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,340
Next up is...

1298
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,211
I lived...

1299
00:47:54,211 --> 00:47:56,581
in Changwon for a while.

1300
00:47:56,641 --> 00:47:57,650
Haha.

1301
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:59,351
- I'll say it to Ji Hyo. - Okay.

1302
00:47:59,351 --> 00:48:00,681
Will you be okay?

1303
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,081
Yes.

1304
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,581
Cue.

1305
00:48:04,621 --> 00:48:05,621
Ji Hyo.

1306
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,820
Eat this.

1307
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,720
I picked it up on the street.

1308
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,931
(Eat this. I picked it up on the street.)

1309
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,260
You can react, Ji Hyo.

1310
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,760
- Is it for me? - Yes.

1311
00:48:15,561 --> 00:48:17,331
Eat it. I picked it up on the street.

1312
00:48:17,371 --> 00:48:19,501
(Have it. I picked it up on the street.)

1313
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,070
You jerk, did you really pick it up?

1314
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:25,271
(You jerk, did you really pick it up?)

1315
00:48:25,271 --> 00:48:26,371
(How did you know?)

1316
00:48:26,371 --> 00:48:28,340
- You picked the wrong one. - You picked the wrong one.

1317
00:48:30,181 --> 00:48:31,351
You picked the wrong one.

1318
00:48:31,351 --> 00:48:33,081
You really picked it up on the street?

1319
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:34,650
- What did you throw at him? - What was it?

1320
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:36,081
- What did you throw? - Did you see that?

1321
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:37,820
I'm sorry.

1322
00:48:38,521 --> 00:48:41,860
He gave her something he really picked up on the street.

1323
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,561
- Next up is Kwang Soo. - Yes.

1324
00:48:45,561 --> 00:48:46,860
- To whom? - Yeon Soo?

1325
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,731
He should do it with So Min.

1326
00:48:48,731 --> 00:48:50,400
That sounds good.

1327
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,800
It might be hard to escape her.

1328
00:48:53,371 --> 00:48:55,570
She won't let you go.

1329
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:59,240
Kwang Soo, take off your jacket. Look cool.

1330
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,240
- You look much better now. - Right?

1331
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:03,740
He looks different.

1332
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:04,911
Nice.

1333
00:49:04,911 --> 00:49:06,150
That shirt is so distracting.

1334
00:49:06,211 --> 00:49:07,420
You look great.

1335
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,380
Let's do this. Cue.

1336
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:11,851
(Striding)

1337
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:16,891
(What will he say?)

1338
00:49:16,891 --> 00:49:18,030
You're cute.

1339
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:23,360
(You're cute, So Min.)

1340
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,530
What's with you?

1341
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,501
You know, I'm...

1342
00:49:26,501 --> 00:49:28,840
You know?

1343
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,001
Say something.

1344
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:31,411
What are you doing?

1345
00:49:31,411 --> 00:49:33,211
Were we strangers?

1346
00:49:33,211 --> 00:49:34,280
(Puzzled)

1347
00:49:34,911 --> 00:49:40,081
(It's a line from the movie, "Nameless Gangster".)

1348
00:49:40,081 --> 00:49:44,050
(So Min even copied the gestures.)

1349
00:49:44,621 --> 00:49:46,720
"I went to the sauna with him."

1350
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,490
You know?

1351
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:51,331
Your... I mean...

1352
00:49:51,331 --> 00:49:53,061
Did I do something wrong?

1353
00:49:53,461 --> 00:49:55,130
I just said she was cute.

1354
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,501
What's with her?

1355
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,840
You did a great job.

1356
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,200
Next up is Jong Kook.

1357
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,311
- Okay. - To whom?

1358
00:50:04,311 --> 00:50:06,771
- Yeon Soo? - He's from Hapcheon.

1359
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:08,240
He's good at speaking dialects.

1360
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,811
Really?

1361
00:50:09,911 --> 00:50:12,411
Let's say we're watching TV at home.

1362
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,780
You're a couple, and you're at home?

1363
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,181
- Are you married? - Are you married?

1364
00:50:16,351 --> 00:50:18,391
- They're newly-weds. - They're married.

1365
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:20,820
They almost kissed during that Yellow Radish Game.

1366
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:22,621
Cue.

1367
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:26,090
Watch anything you like.

1368
00:50:26,661 --> 00:50:28,231
Okay. What should we watch?

1369
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:32,931
(What sweet words will Jong Kook say?)

1370
00:50:32,931 --> 00:50:34,170
I'll just watch you.

1371
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:38,170
(Cheesy)

1372
00:50:38,941 --> 00:50:42,911
(Everyone is revolting.)

1373
00:50:42,911 --> 00:50:44,411
Jong Kook.

1374
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:45,880
That was nice.

1375
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,280
(So Min likes it.)

1376
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,650
What?

1377
00:50:48,751 --> 00:50:50,181
What's wrong?

1378
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:51,791
Jong Kook is disgusting.

1379
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:53,891
- Gosh. - You're disgusting.

1380
00:50:54,191 --> 00:50:56,420
- You've changed a lot. - What?

1381
00:50:56,521 --> 00:50:58,191
Gosh, please stop.

1382
00:50:58,391 --> 00:50:59,691
That's enough.

1383
00:51:00,161 --> 00:51:03,661
Daniel, please show us.

1384
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:05,630
- I have an idea. - You do?

1385
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,070
- Improvise. - I'll do it with Sa Yeon.

1386
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:09,871
(I'll do it with Sa Yeon.)

1387
00:51:10,941 --> 00:51:12,441
Daniel and I?

1388
00:51:12,441 --> 00:51:14,041
(Thrilled)

1389
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,840
Okay.

1390
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,880
Here we go.

1391
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:19,010
- Ms. Noh. - Yes?

1392
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:21,550
(Ms. Noh.)

1393
00:51:21,751 --> 00:51:27,260
(What will the variety show novice say?)

1394
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,791
Can I call you Sa Yeon for today?

1395
00:51:28,791 --> 00:51:33,860
(Can I call you Sa Yeon?)

1396
00:51:34,601 --> 00:51:39,931
(Daniel's dialect makes their hearts skip a beat.)

1397
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:42,840
- That's... - Good job.

1398
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,711
Why are you guys so excited?

1399
00:51:45,041 --> 00:51:46,911
It's...

1400
00:51:46,911 --> 00:51:48,780
- my lucky day! - Sa Yeon.

1401
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:50,911
Can I call you Mom from now on?

1402
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:54,420
(Can I call you Mom?)

1403
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,851
Why would you do that?

1404
00:51:55,851 --> 00:51:58,090
You already have a mom.

1405
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:00,720
(Sa Yeon suddenly has another son.)

1406
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,920
Mom.

1407
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,490
Buy me some winter clothes.

1408
00:52:03,931 --> 00:52:05,691
How long do I have to wear this jacket?

1409
00:52:06,061 --> 00:52:08,400
I don't have a son like you.

1410
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,630
(I don't have a son like you.)

1411
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,871
- What dialect is that? - What dialect is that?

1412
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:15,541
- What's that? - What's that?

1413
00:52:15,541 --> 00:52:17,610
(What dialect is that?)

1414
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:18,641
What's that?

1415
00:52:18,941 --> 00:52:20,441
I loved what you said.

1416
00:52:20,441 --> 00:52:21,981
Daniel is...

1417
00:52:21,981 --> 00:52:24,351
Can't I give it a try?

1418
00:52:24,351 --> 00:52:26,851
- Yeon Soo. - I want to try role-play.

1419
00:52:26,851 --> 00:52:28,021
Sure.

1420
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,081
- With Jong Kook. - With me?

1421
00:52:30,691 --> 00:52:34,791
(What's going on between these two?)

1422
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:35,920
Today...

1423
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,831
Look at Jong Kook's clothes.

1424
00:52:37,831 --> 00:52:40,461
- Look how he's dressed. - Goodness.

1425
00:52:40,461 --> 00:52:42,030
I've been watching.

1426
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:44,200
Why do you two keep doing things together?

1427
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:46,371
In reality, Kwang Soo is more interested in her.

1428
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:49,800
You don't know what will happen once I take off this wig.

1429
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,170
(You don't know what will happen.)

1430
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:52,441
Please say, "Yeon Soo, I'll get going."

1431
00:52:52,441 --> 00:52:53,470
Yeon Soo, I'll get going.

1432
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:54,911
(The second role-play starts.)

1433
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,041
- Right now? - Yes.

1434
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,481
Yeon Soo, I'll get going.

1435
00:52:57,481 --> 00:52:59,181
- Okay. Bye. - Bye.

1436
00:53:00,481 --> 00:53:01,720
Jong Kook!

1437
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,990
(Jong Kook!)

1438
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:10,021
(Yeon Soo runs to Jong Kook. What's going to happen?)

1439
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:11,331
(Hugging)

1440
00:53:11,331 --> 00:53:12,831
What are they doing?

1441
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,530
(She hugs him from the back.)

1442
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:16,001
What are they doing?

1443
00:53:16,001 --> 00:53:17,871
- What are you doing? - Yeon Soo is...

1444
00:53:18,501 --> 00:53:20,001
What are you doing?

1445
00:53:20,601 --> 00:53:22,300
Seriously, what is this?

1446
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,541
I love this game.

1447
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:28,510
This is great. She wins.

1448
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:29,880
- I win. - She wins.

1449
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,110
She wins.

1450
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:32,610
- What are you talking about? - She wins.

1451
00:53:32,811 --> 00:53:33,981
Jong Kook.

1452
00:53:33,981 --> 00:53:35,681
(Let me try.)

1453
00:53:35,681 --> 00:53:37,820
- Let me try too. Jong Kook. - What are you doing?

1454
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,621
- Jong Kook. - Stop it.

1455
00:53:39,621 --> 00:53:41,420
- Jong Kook. - What's with you?

1456
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:43,320
(They look like they're having fun.)

1457
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,490
- What's with you? - Go away!

1458
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:48,300
Oh, my. Are you angry?

1459
00:53:48,461 --> 00:53:50,030
Mom, buy me jeans.

1460
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:52,771
(He's here again.)

1461
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:56,601
- Mom. - Buy me clothes.

1462
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:00,010
Mom, I want matching clothes like yours.

1463
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:01,510
Matching clothes.

1464
00:54:01,811 --> 00:54:03,240
He's a childish son.

1465
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,550
(Every family has one.)

1466
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,280
I want to take English classes.

1467
00:54:06,851 --> 00:54:08,021
Oh, my.

1468
00:54:08,021 --> 00:54:10,990
Seok Jin is very unhappy right now.

1469
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:14,461
- Yeon Soo doesn't even look at him. - I mean...

1470
00:54:14,461 --> 00:54:17,561
- I can try with Seok Jin. - Sure.

1471
00:54:17,561 --> 00:54:19,490
(I can try with Seok Jin.)

1472
00:54:20,231 --> 00:54:22,931
Seok Jin is happy.

1473
00:54:23,001 --> 00:54:24,470
I guess she hates me.

1474
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:27,030
(He thinks Yeon Soo hates him.)

1475
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,101
Okay.

1476
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:30,240
How many have you prepared?

1477
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:31,541
Here we go.

1478
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:33,880
(You don't know what will happen when I take off this wig.)

1479
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,740
We're at an aquarium.

1480
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,851
- We're looking at tropical fish. - Tropical fish?

1481
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:40,981
There's an octopus.

1482
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:43,820
(There's an octopus at the aquarium.)

1483
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:44,990
Be quiet.

1484
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:48,061
It's my turn soon. Be quiet.

1485
00:54:48,061 --> 00:54:49,161
It's a blowfish.

1486
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,391
(You're an octopus.)

1487
00:54:50,391 --> 00:54:51,431
An octopus?

1488
00:54:51,791 --> 00:54:53,731
(He starts to swim around.)

1489
00:54:53,731 --> 00:54:55,260
What is this?

1490
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,970
What did I do wrong?

1491
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,871
Seok Jin, are you happy to be with me here?

1492
00:55:04,871 --> 00:55:06,070
(The role-play starts.)

1493
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:07,141
Of course.

1494
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,380
Give me a kiss.

1495
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:12,950
(Give me a kiss.)

1496
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,981
(A kiss?)

1497
00:55:15,981 --> 00:55:20,220
(This is too much.)

1498
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,760
Those idiots are going overboard.

1499
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,590
(The octopus passing by is at a loss for words.)

1500
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,961
(The octopus said the correct answer.)

1501
00:55:27,961 --> 00:55:29,731
- Good job. - Did you hear me?

1502
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,070
I was in the aquarium. How could you hear me?

1503
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:36,070
(The octopus wrapped it up nicely.)

1504
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:39,110
That was very nice. Kwang Soo.

1505
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,681
So Min, do you want to try?

1506
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,981
Which one?

1507
00:55:42,981 --> 00:55:45,050
- The kiss? - What?

1508
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,581
I mean...

1509
00:55:46,981 --> 00:55:48,880
What kiss?

1510
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,050
- I mean the role-play. - Role-play?

1511
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:52,720
- No kissing? - No.

1512
00:55:52,851 --> 00:55:54,291
Sae Ho, do you want to try?

1513
00:55:54,291 --> 00:55:55,490
- Okay. - Okay.

1514
00:55:55,791 --> 00:55:58,630
Just improvise. You never know what So Min will say.

1515
00:55:59,291 --> 00:56:02,030
Why do you keep showing up?

1516
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,700
- Sae Ho. - Get off of me.

1517
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,231
What's with you?

1518
00:56:05,371 --> 00:56:06,800
- Stop it. - Sae Ho.

1519
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,941
Why are you taking off my clothes?

1520
00:56:08,941 --> 00:56:10,101
Wait.

1521
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,141
- What is going on? - Why are you taking off my clothes?

1522
00:56:12,641 --> 00:56:14,441
What is going on?

1523
00:56:14,441 --> 00:56:16,681
What is she doing?

1524
00:56:16,911 --> 00:56:18,811
What's happening?

1525
00:56:18,911 --> 00:56:21,050
What are you doing?

1526
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:22,521
He came home.

1527
00:56:22,521 --> 00:56:24,021
- What's happening? - There's a scene...

1528
00:56:24,021 --> 00:56:26,391
like this in "The Outlaws", but can she do that?

1529
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:29,860
There's a scene like this in "The Outlaws".

1530
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,260
(It's not that scene.)

1531
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:33,191
My husband came home.

1532
00:56:33,191 --> 00:56:35,360
- I'm your husband? - Yes.

1533
00:56:35,431 --> 00:56:36,831
You should have told me.

1534
00:56:36,831 --> 00:56:39,271
I thought you just randomly showed up.

1535
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:42,170
What are you doing, So Min?

1536
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:44,340
(I'll open the door first.)

1537
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,740
It's over.

1538
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,880
(The role-play is over.)

1539
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,880
- It's over? - What were you doing?

1540
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,780
I was opening the door.

1541
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:53,050
- It's over. - Okay.

1542
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:55,280
(I wanted to start over.)

1543
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,220
This is awkward.

1544
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:00,150
(After So Min took his jacket off, he feels awkward.)

1545
00:57:01,461 --> 00:57:02,461
She took off your clothes.

1546
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:04,961
(The game ends in a tie.)

1547
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,630
The next game is Spinning in Place.

1548
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,231
- It's... - Sae Ho is good at it.

1549
00:57:08,231 --> 00:57:09,800
No one can beat him.

1550
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,271
(Sae Ho is invincible when it comes to Spinning in Place.)

1551
00:57:11,271 --> 00:57:14,840
(During the Family Outing Special last July,)

1552
00:57:14,871 --> 00:57:18,541
(Sae Ho showed unrivaled talent during Spinning in Place.)

1553
00:57:18,641 --> 00:57:23,441
(He touched Jae Seok's nose after spinning 20 times in place.)

1554
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:27,320
(He's the king of Spinning in Place.)

1555
00:57:27,581 --> 00:57:28,581
It makes you very dizzy.

1556
00:57:29,081 --> 00:57:30,150
- Right? - Yes.

1557
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:31,720
- Have you spun 20 times? - Start.

1558
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,391
(Spinning)

1559
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:36,561
(He spins extremely fast.)

1560
00:57:36,561 --> 00:57:38,431
- 4, 5. - He wins if he does it.

1561
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:40,291
(He's much faster than Sae Ho.)

1562
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:42,231
He's the winner if he wins this game.

1563
00:57:42,231 --> 00:57:44,431
- He's faster than Sae Ho. - 6, 7, 8.

1564
00:57:45,231 --> 00:57:47,070
- Can he do it? - He spins well.

1565
00:57:47,441 --> 00:57:49,240
- He's so fast. - He's young after all.

1566
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,541
He deserves an applause after spinning.

1567
00:57:50,541 --> 00:57:51,970
It's enough to make you dizzy.

1568
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,911
18, 19, 20.

1569
00:57:54,911 --> 00:57:55,911
Here he goes.

1570
00:57:55,911 --> 00:57:57,081
(He spins 20 times very quickly.)

1571
00:57:57,811 --> 00:58:03,320
(He succeeds if he walks straight to Kwang Soo's nose.)

1572
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,220
(He stumbles.)

1573
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:09,161
(This is the wrong direction.)

1574
00:58:09,161 --> 00:58:10,260
He's flustered.

1575
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:11,331
What's wrong?

1576
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,891
I'm over here.

1577
00:58:12,891 --> 00:58:14,530
- Why did you grab me? - I'm here.

1578
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:18,101
- Daniel is just like us. - I was surprised.

1579
00:58:18,101 --> 00:58:20,101
(Why is this his strongest weapon?)

1580
00:58:20,101 --> 00:58:21,400
- He's human. - Are you okay?

1581
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,771
- Are you okay? - I wanted to show you something.

1582
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:27,811
It's good to see him work hard.

1583
00:58:27,811 --> 00:58:29,081
(It's okay even if he's clumsy.)

1584
00:58:29,081 --> 00:58:31,351
The last one is Four Leg Run.

1585
00:58:31,811 --> 00:58:33,820
Three members will volunteer and play.

1586
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,351
One from each team should volunteer.

1587
00:58:35,351 --> 00:58:37,450
(Including Daniel, one member from each team plays.)

1588
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:41,061
- Let's go, Daniel. - Let's go.

1589
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:42,661
Let's go, Se Chan.

1590
00:58:42,661 --> 00:58:43,720
(Daniel, Kwang Soo, and Se Chan play.)

1591
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,760
All right.

1592
00:58:44,791 --> 00:58:46,090
(Kang Daniel, Lee Kwang Soo, Yang Se Chan)

1593
00:58:46,691 --> 00:58:47,860
Now...

1594
00:58:48,231 --> 00:58:50,470
- Look at Kwang Soo. - Do you know the type?

1595
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:51,970
Gosh, look at him.

1596
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:53,501
He looks scary.

1597
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,470
Daniel, Kwang Soo, and Se Chan will play.

1598
00:58:57,871 --> 00:59:00,340
I'm nervous after...

1599
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:03,240
watching Daniel play Spinning in Place.

1600
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:06,751
He isn't good at it.

1601
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:08,581
- He doesn't seem good. - I know.

1602
00:59:09,081 --> 00:59:10,990
He seems athletic though.

1603
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:12,791
He's ambitious.

1604
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:14,860
Be careful, Daniel.

1605
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:17,561
If you're hurt, I'm hurt too.

1606
00:59:17,561 --> 00:59:18,590
(I'll do better this time.)

1607
00:59:18,691 --> 00:59:20,030
Get ready.

1608
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:22,661
(Will ambitious Daniel win this time?)

1609
00:59:22,661 --> 00:59:23,760
Set.

1610
00:59:25,001 --> 00:59:26,070
(Four Leg Run starts.)

1611
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:27,141
Here they come.

1612
00:59:27,371 --> 00:59:29,900
Why is there a ribbon?

1613
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,041
(Kwang Soo charges forward.)

1614
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:32,941
(He trips.)

1615
00:59:33,411 --> 00:59:34,441
What's this?

1616
00:59:34,441 --> 00:59:35,510
(While Kwang Soo falls,)

1617
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:38,450
(Se Chan moves forward.)

1618
00:59:39,211 --> 00:59:42,621
(Much faster than Se Chan, Daniel takes the lead.)

1619
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:44,021
Daniel is good.

1620
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,891
(Where is he headed?)

1621
00:59:48,891 --> 00:59:52,391
Daniel isn't doing well. What is he doing?

1622
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,561
(He moves forward without looking.)

1623
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:55,760
What is he doing?

1624
00:59:57,271 --> 00:59:58,570
Daniel, watch out.

1625
00:59:58,931 --> 01:00:00,871
- I'm sorry. - What's wrong with him?

1626
01:00:00,871 --> 01:00:01,941
(He crashes with the cameras.)

1627
01:00:01,941 --> 01:00:03,001
I couldn't see the front.

1628
01:00:03,001 --> 01:00:04,070
(He's flustered.)

1629
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,371
- You came in first. - I'm sorry.

1630
01:00:05,371 --> 01:00:07,311
Where did you go?

1631
01:00:07,311 --> 01:00:09,110
I couldn't see ahead.

1632
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:10,110
(Daniel's clumsiness is confirmed.)

1633
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:12,510
- I'm sorry. - Gosh, Daniel.

1634
01:00:13,751 --> 01:00:19,320
(He had to stop due to a crash.)

1635
01:00:19,391 --> 01:00:24,061
(Daniel is accepted as the winner as he arrived first.)

1636
01:00:24,161 --> 01:00:26,691
I think Daniel determined...

1637
01:00:26,891 --> 01:00:28,700
his personality on variety shows.

1638
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,831
- I didn't expect it. - This is great.

1639
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:32,470
I thought he was a rhinoceros.

1640
01:00:32,501 --> 01:00:34,170
(Daniel kept moving forward.)

1641
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,300
- That's not it. - Why did you drag it?

1642
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,311
I tripped.

1643
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:40,641
I pulled up my pants to run faster.

1644
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:43,141
Running Man took away all the hair on my body.

1645
01:00:43,211 --> 01:00:46,110
(He realizes the truth.)

1646
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:48,481
(He recalls being waxed.)

1647
01:00:48,481 --> 01:00:49,950
I didn't realize it for two days.

1648
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:51,220
(It was a painful experience.)

1649
01:00:52,891 --> 01:00:53,920
I'd forgotten about it.

1650
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,561
(Thanks to Running Man, he's smooth all over.)

1651
01:00:56,561 --> 01:00:58,831
We aren't quite sure,

1652
01:00:58,831 --> 01:01:02,001
but Daniel places first anyway.

1653
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:03,331
Thank you.

1654
01:01:03,331 --> 01:01:04,670
(Daniel wins Four Leg Run.)

1655
01:01:04,871 --> 01:01:08,441
Mungdol Gang, the winner of Four Leg Run,

1656
01:01:08,441 --> 01:01:10,711
will receive 200 dollars.

1657
01:01:10,711 --> 01:01:11,740
(Mungdol Gang wins 200 dollars.)

1658
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:14,240
After you change into the outfits that your bosses have chosen,

1659
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,610
we'll start the race.

1660
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:20,081
(After they get changed, the race officially starts.)

1661
01:01:21,296 --> 01:01:24,465
As you might be hungry, we'll go to a restaurant.

1662
01:01:24,465 --> 01:01:26,206
- That's great. - We're going to eat.

1663
01:01:26,535 --> 01:01:30,075
The bosses will receive...

1664
01:01:30,075 --> 01:01:32,005
1,000 dollars.

1665
01:01:32,005 --> 01:01:33,075
I see.

1666
01:01:33,075 --> 01:01:36,476
(1,000 dollars is given to the boss of each gang.)

1667
01:01:36,476 --> 01:01:37,586
Aren't you our boss?

1668
01:01:37,586 --> 01:01:38,586
- Boss. - 1,000 dollars?

1669
01:01:38,586 --> 01:01:40,285
As I told you before,

1670
01:01:40,285 --> 01:01:42,856
1,000 dollars will be given as a prize.

1671
01:01:42,856 --> 01:01:44,856
It will be given to one member in reality.

1672
01:01:44,856 --> 01:01:46,686
- In reality? - Yes.

1673
01:01:46,686 --> 01:01:47,755
Really?

1674
01:01:48,026 --> 01:01:51,925
Mungdol Gang has earned 200 dollars as of now.

1675
01:01:52,396 --> 01:01:54,635
- It's a total of 1,200 dollars. - That's a lot.

1676
01:01:55,135 --> 01:01:57,066
- Sae Ho. - Awesome.

1677
01:01:57,066 --> 01:01:59,035
- Sae Ho. - Awesome.

1678
01:01:59,035 --> 01:02:01,276
Are you the chauffeur...

1679
01:02:01,276 --> 01:02:03,305
for the man and the two ladies?

1680
01:02:04,476 --> 01:02:06,146
I haven't determined my character yet.

1681
01:02:06,146 --> 01:02:07,345
Is that so?

1682
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:11,316
Are you Piggy Mom?

1683
01:02:11,316 --> 01:02:14,186
I can play any type of character.

1684
01:02:14,186 --> 01:02:15,715
(Look for Piggy Mom at the entrance.)

1685
01:02:15,715 --> 01:02:18,885
Each gang has a boss.

1686
01:02:18,885 --> 01:02:20,956
The boss has the authority...

1687
01:02:20,956 --> 01:02:23,996
to distribute the capital to the gang members.

1688
01:02:23,996 --> 01:02:25,296
That's awesome.

1689
01:02:25,396 --> 01:02:27,936
Does the boss distribute it however he wants?

1690
01:02:28,166 --> 01:02:30,965
Let me tell you about...

1691
01:02:31,305 --> 01:02:33,005
Boss' Unfair Deal.

1692
01:02:33,365 --> 01:02:35,606
The boss may equally distribute...

1693
01:02:35,606 --> 01:02:38,405
the capital of 1,000 dollars to the gang members.

1694
01:02:38,405 --> 01:02:41,945
He may distribute 250 dollars each.

1695
01:02:41,945 --> 01:02:43,276
- Or? - Or...

1696
01:02:43,276 --> 01:02:45,785
he may distribute it unfairly...

1697
01:02:45,785 --> 01:02:47,785
however he likes.

1698
01:02:48,456 --> 01:02:52,285
Gang members can't find out how much capital is distributed.

1699
01:02:52,285 --> 01:02:54,726
- However, the gang members... - We can't find out.

1700
01:02:54,726 --> 01:02:57,126
get one chance to revolt and find out...

1701
01:02:57,126 --> 01:03:02,766
how much capital they're given before the final race.

1702
01:03:03,095 --> 01:03:04,305
Revolt?

1703
01:03:04,305 --> 01:03:06,336
If you suspect the boss to be unfair,

1704
01:03:06,336 --> 01:03:08,175
you may use the Revolution Card.

1705
01:03:08,175 --> 01:03:10,075
You may find out how much you received.

1706
01:03:10,075 --> 01:03:11,575
It's better to distribute fairly.

1707
01:03:11,575 --> 01:03:14,476
If you find out that the boss distributed fairly,

1708
01:03:14,476 --> 01:03:16,876
then it was wrong to revolt.

1709
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:17,885
I see.

1710
01:03:17,885 --> 01:03:20,956
All distributed capital will return to the boss.

1711
01:03:20,956 --> 01:03:25,226
(All distributed capital returns to the boss.)

1712
01:03:25,255 --> 01:03:27,026
That's great.

1713
01:03:27,055 --> 01:03:30,496
If the boss distributed unfairly, the revolt is successful.

1714
01:03:30,496 --> 01:03:33,365
The boss' capital is divided equally to the members.

1715
01:03:33,365 --> 01:03:34,436
After a while...

1716
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:36,896
- The boss can act suspiciously. - Right.

1717
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,566
There are many who love to revolt.

1718
01:03:38,566 --> 01:03:41,106
I'll use it now.

1719
01:03:41,836 --> 01:03:42,876
Can we use it now?

1720
01:03:42,876 --> 01:03:44,345
You have to do it in secret.

1721
01:03:44,345 --> 01:03:47,005
(He revolts instinctively.)

1722
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:49,276
(How will the bosses distribute?)

1723
01:03:49,276 --> 01:03:51,246
In your standing order,

1724
01:03:51,246 --> 01:03:53,186
Yeon Soo will decide first.

1725
01:03:53,186 --> 01:03:56,155
(Yeon Soo starts to distribute.)

1726
01:03:56,155 --> 01:04:00,055
(The boss gets everything if someone revolts when distributed fairly.)

1727
01:04:00,055 --> 01:04:01,126
Let's see.

1728
01:04:01,126 --> 01:04:03,325
(Members get the capital when distributed unfairly.)

1729
01:04:03,325 --> 01:04:04,595
To Kwang Soo...

1730
01:04:05,865 --> 01:04:07,066
To Seok Jin...

1731
01:04:07,695 --> 01:04:11,235
(How did the bosses distribute the capital?)

1732
01:04:11,535 --> 01:04:13,166
- Let's go. - Here we go.

1733
01:04:13,635 --> 01:04:14,776
Let's go.

1734
01:04:14,776 --> 01:04:15,805
(They head to the restaurant.)

1735
01:04:16,405 --> 01:04:19,505
- Our boss is competitive, right? - Yes, she's strong.

1736
01:04:20,075 --> 01:04:21,146
She's also ambitious.

1737
01:04:21,675 --> 01:04:24,445
She's not the type to do something ordinary.

1738
01:04:24,445 --> 01:04:25,586
- That's right. - Never.

1739
01:04:25,586 --> 01:04:28,285
I bet she didn't give herself 250 dollars.

1740
01:04:28,285 --> 01:04:29,755
That's possible.

1741
01:04:29,755 --> 01:04:31,485
It doesn't matter.

1742
01:04:31,485 --> 01:04:33,925
You can be suspicious and use the Revolution Card.

1743
01:04:33,925 --> 01:04:34,996
(If you're confident...)

1744
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:36,126
- Do you want all the money? - I'm okay.

1745
01:04:36,126 --> 01:04:38,925
Yes, I'll take all.

1746
01:04:39,365 --> 01:04:41,566
- Please use the card. - We won't suspect you.

1747
01:04:42,865 --> 01:04:44,666
Let's be friends.

1748
01:04:44,666 --> 01:04:46,005
We're so great.

1749
01:04:46,066 --> 01:04:48,175
- We trust Yeon Soo. - Seriously.

1750
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:49,206
We trust you completely.

1751
01:04:49,476 --> 01:04:50,476
We turn right.

1752
01:04:50,476 --> 01:04:52,005
(On the other hand...)

1753
01:04:52,005 --> 01:04:53,305
That's good.

1754
01:04:53,876 --> 01:04:54,945
We're turning right.

1755
01:04:54,945 --> 01:04:56,715
(Piggy Mom is driving.)

1756
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:59,246
It may be too early to bring it up,

1757
01:04:59,246 --> 01:05:02,016
but did you distribute the capital evenly?

1758
01:05:02,016 --> 01:05:03,985
- 300 dollars each. - Right?

1759
01:05:03,985 --> 01:05:06,026
- Can we trust you? - Yes.

1760
01:05:06,026 --> 01:05:07,026
I distributed 300 dollars each.

1761
01:05:08,126 --> 01:05:10,155
Did you give 250 dollars each?

1762
01:05:10,766 --> 01:05:12,566
- For gangs, - That's right.

1763
01:05:12,566 --> 01:05:14,296
loyalty and trust are important.

1764
01:05:14,296 --> 01:05:15,336
Of course.

1765
01:05:15,336 --> 01:05:16,336
(Are they telling the truth?)

1766
01:05:17,805 --> 01:05:19,266
There's a lake.

1767
01:05:19,505 --> 01:05:20,606
It's bulgogi.

1768
01:05:20,606 --> 01:05:21,675
(They arrive at the restaurant.)

1769
01:05:21,675 --> 01:05:23,476
There's seasoned raw beef and pajeon.

1770
01:05:23,845 --> 01:05:25,706
Please sit with your team.

1771
01:05:26,246 --> 01:05:28,016
(Yuchen Gang sit down quickly.)

1772
01:05:28,016 --> 01:05:31,615
He's the manager of the restaurant.

1773
01:05:31,615 --> 01:05:32,785
- Is that so? - Yes.

1774
01:05:32,916 --> 01:05:34,586
Welcome. It's nice to meet you.

1775
01:05:34,586 --> 01:05:36,686
- Hello. - Over here.

1776
01:05:36,686 --> 01:05:38,626
Bring some more meat.

1777
01:05:39,755 --> 01:05:41,026
- Please sit down. - Thank you.

1778
01:05:41,055 --> 01:05:42,095
He fits perfectly.

1779
01:05:42,925 --> 01:05:44,595
(He works hard to keep the customers satisfied.)

1780
01:05:46,166 --> 01:05:49,896
(It's time to enjoy the food.)

1781
01:05:52,035 --> 01:05:53,535
We should eat well.

1782
01:05:53,535 --> 01:05:55,376
- Give me your plate, Seok Jin. - Okay.

1783
01:05:55,376 --> 01:05:56,575
(Sa Yeon takes care of the younger members.)

1784
01:05:56,575 --> 01:05:58,046
Thank you. That's a lot of meat.

1785
01:05:58,505 --> 01:06:00,575
If you only look at these four,

1786
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:04,086
Sa Yeon seems like a charity worker.

1787
01:06:05,715 --> 01:06:07,715
She's someone who helps...

1788
01:06:08,115 --> 01:06:09,956
the poor.

1789
01:06:10,115 --> 01:06:11,626
She's full of love.

1790
01:06:12,226 --> 01:06:13,825
She washes and feeds them.

1791
01:06:13,825 --> 01:06:15,026
(She shares food with love and kindness.)

1792
01:06:15,026 --> 01:06:16,595
I agree.

1793
01:06:16,595 --> 01:06:17,726
- She serves us too. - I can't help but agree.

1794
01:06:18,095 --> 01:06:20,166
I agree as well.

1795
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:21,595
(She raised them with love.)

1796
01:06:22,666 --> 01:06:24,066
Did you enjoy the meal?

1797
01:06:24,066 --> 01:06:25,106
- Yes. - Yes.

1798
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:28,635
Before we move on to the next round,

1799
01:06:28,635 --> 01:06:31,976
does anyone want to use the Revolution Card?

1800
01:06:31,976 --> 01:06:36,376
(Does anyone want to use the Revolution Card?)

1801
01:06:36,376 --> 01:06:38,916
We trust each other, right?

1802
01:06:39,016 --> 01:06:41,615
Our boss tells us we should never do that.

1803
01:06:41,755 --> 01:06:43,115
Why would you revolt?

1804
01:06:43,115 --> 01:06:44,925
We have no reason to.

1805
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:46,325
- So... - Trust us.

1806
01:06:46,325 --> 01:06:47,325
we will...

1807
01:06:48,595 --> 01:06:51,266
(Sa Yeon is a kind boss.)

1808
01:06:51,266 --> 01:06:54,365
(Considering her character...)

1809
01:06:55,066 --> 01:06:56,465
We will use the Revolution Card.

1810
01:06:56,465 --> 01:06:59,635
- You are unbelievable. - We will use the Revolution Card.

1811
01:06:59,635 --> 01:07:00,976
- Why would you use it? - I have my reasons.

1812
01:07:00,976 --> 01:07:02,075
- Who wants to use it? - Listen.

1813
01:07:02,075 --> 01:07:03,976
- I have my reasons. - You are unbelievable.

1814
01:07:03,976 --> 01:07:04,976
Already?

1815
01:07:05,075 --> 01:07:08,416
She fed you, tucked you in, and bathed you. Have you no shame?

1816
01:07:09,376 --> 01:07:11,316
(It's fun to witness betrayal.)

1817
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:13,516
Do you want to check how much I gave you?

1818
01:07:14,016 --> 01:07:16,385
Then you have to pay me back.

1819
01:07:16,385 --> 01:07:18,856
(Then you have to pay me back.)

1820
01:07:18,856 --> 01:07:19,925
Really?

1821
01:07:19,956 --> 01:07:22,396
- Then you won't have any money. - That's right.

1822
01:07:22,555 --> 01:07:23,865
Are you really going to use it, Kwang Soo?

1823
01:07:23,865 --> 01:07:26,095
- Do you want to check? - Let's discuss once more.

1824
01:07:26,095 --> 01:07:27,896
In 1, 2, 3.

1825
01:07:27,896 --> 01:07:30,295
- We will use it. - We will use it.

1826
01:07:30,965 --> 01:07:32,566
(They are ungrateful.)

1827
01:07:32,566 --> 01:07:36,805
I will announce how the capital of Yuchen Gang was distributed.

1828
01:07:37,476 --> 01:07:41,045
Out of 1,000 dollars, Sa Yeon has...

1829
01:07:41,045 --> 01:07:46,585
(How much money does she have out of 1,000 dollars?)

1830
01:07:46,585 --> 01:07:48,755
- 940 dollars. - Okay!

1831
01:07:48,755 --> 01:07:49,915
(Sa Yeon took 940 dollars.)

1832
01:07:49,915 --> 01:07:51,585
(She gets caught on her unfair distribution.)

1833
01:07:51,585 --> 01:07:52,826
- I knew it. - Did we receive 20 dollars each?

1834
01:07:53,326 --> 01:07:56,896
(Distributing capital before leaving for the restaurant)

1835
01:08:00,866 --> 01:08:03,266
(30 dollars for Kwang Soo)

1836
01:08:03,266 --> 01:08:04,906
(20 dollars for Seok Jin)

1837
01:08:04,906 --> 01:08:07,276
(10 dollars for Jae Seok)

1838
01:08:09,276 --> 01:08:12,276
- Did you give us 20 dollars each? - 20 dollars?

1839
01:08:12,276 --> 01:08:13,646
(She gave herself 940 dollars.)

1840
01:08:13,646 --> 01:08:15,776
(I am the best at spotting betrayal.)

1841
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:18,085
- Did you give us 20 dollars each? - 20 dollars?

1842
01:08:18,085 --> 01:08:20,146
- 20 dollars. - 20 out of 1,000 dollars?

1843
01:08:20,786 --> 01:08:22,856
Rich people are worse.

1844
01:08:22,856 --> 01:08:24,186
I didn't know you would be like this.

1845
01:08:24,186 --> 01:08:26,085
Don't say that. I didn't know you would be like this.

1846
01:08:26,085 --> 01:08:28,726
- Why do you say that? - Why is she upset at us?

1847
01:08:28,726 --> 01:08:31,465
- I knew it. - She acted all nice before.

1848
01:08:31,465 --> 01:08:33,266
- My goodness. - Now, I will have...

1849
01:08:33,726 --> 01:08:35,866
- 920 dollars. - I will have 920 dollars.

1850
01:08:35,866 --> 01:08:36,866
320 dollars.

1851
01:08:37,066 --> 01:08:38,266
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1852
01:08:38,266 --> 01:08:40,005
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1853
01:08:40,305 --> 01:08:41,936
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1854
01:08:42,536 --> 01:08:43,875
(Seok Jin wins.)

1855
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:45,875
- I won. - Step back.

1856
01:08:45,875 --> 01:08:47,116
I will have 910 dollars.

1857
01:08:47,116 --> 01:08:48,175
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1858
01:08:48,175 --> 01:08:50,175
(Kwang Soo wins this time.)

1859
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:52,715
Then I get the money, right?

1860
01:08:52,885 --> 01:08:54,455
Is that how it works?

1861
01:08:54,455 --> 01:08:55,455
(Doesn't the winner get the money?)

1862
01:08:55,455 --> 01:08:56,455
Didn't I win?

1863
01:08:56,455 --> 01:08:57,885
He won.

1864
01:08:58,286 --> 01:08:59,755
Seok Jin got eliminated because he won.

1865
01:08:59,955 --> 01:09:01,795
- Between you and me, who won? - I did.

1866
01:09:01,795 --> 01:09:02,856
Then you are eliminated.

1867
01:09:03,295 --> 01:09:05,165
- I won. - Why was I eliminated?

1868
01:09:05,165 --> 01:09:06,925
- Wait a minute. - I won, didn't I?

1869
01:09:07,165 --> 01:09:08,995
You are so stupid, Kwang Soo.

1870
01:09:10,936 --> 01:09:12,236
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1871
01:09:12,366 --> 01:09:13,366
Rock-paper-scissors

1872
01:09:13,766 --> 01:09:14,976
- I won. - Okay.

1873
01:09:14,976 --> 01:09:16,106
Rock-paper-scissors

1874
01:09:16,976 --> 01:09:18,076
I won.

1875
01:09:18,076 --> 01:09:20,076
(Yu Chen is the winner.)

1876
01:09:20,446 --> 01:09:23,175
I can't believe they agreed to play another round.

1877
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:25,045
How could they accept that?

1878
01:09:25,045 --> 01:09:26,845
How were they persuaded?

1879
01:09:26,845 --> 01:09:28,885
What is wrong with them? Is it the effect of makeup?

1880
01:09:28,885 --> 01:09:30,215
Did the makeup make them that way?

1881
01:09:30,215 --> 01:09:33,356
Let's move on to the next game.

1882
01:09:33,486 --> 01:09:34,726
All right.

1883
01:09:35,255 --> 01:09:39,326
With this mission, you can win the prize money of 400 dollars.

1884
01:09:40,095 --> 01:09:42,396
(You can win the prize money of 400 dollars.)

1885
01:09:42,396 --> 01:09:44,205
- Okay! - Let's do this.

1886
01:09:44,205 --> 01:09:45,766
We need to get the prize money.

1887
01:09:45,766 --> 01:09:48,576
This is the psychological quiz, I Heard It Through the Grapevine.

1888
01:09:48,576 --> 01:09:50,675
(I Heard It Through the Grapevine)

1889
01:09:50,675 --> 01:09:51,805
- I Heard It Through the Grapevine. - I Heard It Through the Grapevine.

1890
01:09:51,805 --> 01:09:52,845
How does it work?

1891
01:09:52,875 --> 01:09:56,915
The two people in the front row will participate from each team.

1892
01:09:57,186 --> 01:10:00,245
One team will be the offensive team and present a problem.

1893
01:10:00,316 --> 01:10:02,955
The other two teams will solve it as the defensive teams.

1894
01:10:03,656 --> 01:10:07,455
The offensive team will pick someone who is likely to answer incorrectly.

1895
01:10:07,795 --> 01:10:11,465
If that person answers incorrectly, he or she will be eliminated...

1896
01:10:11,465 --> 01:10:12,995
and replaced with another member of the team.

1897
01:10:13,266 --> 01:10:14,566
If both members are likely to answer correctly,

1898
01:10:14,566 --> 01:10:16,635
shout out, "You all know, right?"

1899
01:10:16,635 --> 01:10:20,366
(Shout out, "You all know, right?")

1900
01:10:20,366 --> 01:10:22,276
It involves guessing.

1901
01:10:22,276 --> 01:10:23,576
We need to guess whether the others answered correctly or not.

1902
01:10:23,576 --> 01:10:25,406
You can either write down the correct answer...

1903
01:10:25,406 --> 01:10:27,915
or write down the incorrect answer on purpose.

1904
01:10:27,915 --> 01:10:30,786
When the two members are eliminated,

1905
01:10:30,786 --> 01:10:32,915
- that team is out. - Okay.

1906
01:10:32,915 --> 01:10:35,656
(When the 2 members are eliminated, that team is out.)

1907
01:10:37,125 --> 01:10:39,125
(Team Police carefully chooses 1 out of 8 problems.)

1908
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:40,125
Okay.

1909
01:10:40,925 --> 01:10:42,755
I didn't like the other one. Let's take a look.

1910
01:10:43,925 --> 01:10:46,165
This is a long problem. It's a long one.

1911
01:10:46,165 --> 01:10:47,835
- It's really difficult. - Okay!

1912
01:10:48,066 --> 01:10:50,165
You chose well.

1913
01:10:50,165 --> 01:10:51,566
Good job.

1914
01:10:51,566 --> 01:10:53,465
No one will know the answer.

1915
01:10:53,465 --> 01:10:55,175
- Shall I read it out loud? - Yes.

1916
01:10:55,175 --> 01:10:57,345
- It's very difficult. - I will read the problem out loud.

1917
01:10:57,375 --> 01:11:00,976
"During the Joseon Dynasty, men gave women..."

1918
01:11:01,076 --> 01:11:05,646
"a part of his body as a symbol of love."

1919
01:11:06,016 --> 01:11:07,045
They gave something?

1920
01:11:07,045 --> 01:11:08,186
(What could it be?)

1921
01:11:08,186 --> 01:11:10,415
"In a satirical novel, 'Baebijang-Jeon',"

1922
01:11:10,455 --> 01:11:13,125
"Jeong Bi Jang gives this to a kisaeng named A Rang."

1923
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:15,255
- "What is this?" - They gave something?

1924
01:11:15,255 --> 01:11:17,566
(Do they know the answer?)

1925
01:11:17,566 --> 01:11:19,266
(Do they plan to write down the incorrect answer?)

1926
01:11:19,266 --> 01:11:21,095
(Thinking)

1927
01:11:21,635 --> 01:11:23,766
- Ji Hyo, you don't know, right? - Ji Hyo, you don't know, right?

1928
01:11:23,766 --> 01:11:26,366
(Ji Hyo, you don't know, right?)

1929
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:27,375
(Surprised)

1930
01:11:27,375 --> 01:11:28,835
She was thinking so hard.

1931
01:11:28,976 --> 01:11:30,076
I am 100-percent sure.

1932
01:11:30,076 --> 01:11:31,576
- I know the answer. - Okay.

1933
01:11:31,976 --> 01:11:34,545
Ji Hyo is acting. My goodness.

1934
01:11:34,675 --> 01:11:36,016
I am serious.

1935
01:11:36,016 --> 01:11:37,215
- Okay. - I am serious.

1936
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:38,915
We can pick Ji Hyo.

1937
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:40,885
Look at Kwang Soo.

1938
01:11:41,656 --> 01:11:42,656
Could you read the question again?

1939
01:11:42,816 --> 01:11:44,656
Daniel doesn't know the answer.

1940
01:11:44,826 --> 01:11:47,495
He keeps looking around.

1941
01:11:47,495 --> 01:11:49,555
He keeps looking around.

1942
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:51,095
Did you write down the answer?

1943
01:11:51,266 --> 01:11:52,896
- It has to be right. - Did you write down the answer?

1944
01:11:52,896 --> 01:11:55,736
Kwang Soo, my goodness.

1945
01:11:55,995 --> 01:11:57,406
(Does Kwang Soo have the correct answer?)

1946
01:11:57,406 --> 01:11:58,805
You are impressive.

1947
01:11:58,805 --> 01:12:00,366
- You don't disappoint. - There weren't a lot of options.

1948
01:12:00,366 --> 01:12:02,236
- You don't disappoint. - Seok Jin.

1949
01:12:03,106 --> 01:12:04,545
- Did you finish? - Yes.

1950
01:12:04,545 --> 01:12:05,606
You can't change the answer now.

1951
01:12:05,805 --> 01:12:07,576
Let's see the answer.

1952
01:12:07,576 --> 01:12:08,576
In 1, 2, 3.

1953
01:12:08,576 --> 01:12:10,415
(Tooth)

1954
01:12:10,415 --> 01:12:11,845
- My goodness. - Tooth?

1955
01:12:11,845 --> 01:12:12,845
Why?

1956
01:12:13,286 --> 01:12:14,385
Jae Seok.

1957
01:12:14,385 --> 01:12:15,516
Did men give women their teeth?

1958
01:12:17,016 --> 01:12:19,286
- Didn't Ji Hyo write for a while? - Yes, she did.

1959
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:21,396
(They remember that she wrote for a while.)

1960
01:12:21,856 --> 01:12:23,995
- Neither one of them knew. - They didn't know the answer.

1961
01:12:23,995 --> 01:12:25,366
(It seems like neither one of them knew.)

1962
01:12:25,366 --> 01:12:28,736
- I saw how Daniel acted. - I...

1963
01:12:28,736 --> 01:12:30,635
(He is similar to Ji Hyo.)

1964
01:12:30,635 --> 01:12:32,906
I read the book.

1965
01:12:32,906 --> 01:12:34,375
- I read the book. - What's the title of the book?

1966
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:35,805
A satirical novel, "Jaebijang-Jeon".

1967
01:12:35,805 --> 01:12:37,875
- You didn't know the answer, right? - Of course, I did.

1968
01:12:38,045 --> 01:12:39,576
Let's ask Seok Jin.

1969
01:12:39,576 --> 01:12:43,016
I came to know about it thanks to my wife.

1970
01:12:43,016 --> 01:12:44,385
What about your wife?

1971
01:12:44,385 --> 01:12:46,845
- She told me... - He came up with a story.

1972
01:12:46,845 --> 01:12:49,016
I am telling you the truth.

1973
01:12:49,016 --> 01:12:52,986
When my child lost a tooth,

1974
01:12:53,125 --> 01:12:55,955
- she told me to give it to her. - Really?

1975
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:59,266
Then she told me about a custom... Why are you laughing?

1976
01:12:59,266 --> 01:13:01,936
Then she told me about a custom... Why are you laughing?

1977
01:13:01,936 --> 01:13:02,936
(They can't help but burst out laughing.)

1978
01:13:02,936 --> 01:13:07,576
My stomach hurts from laughing. Did she want to keep the tooth?

1979
01:13:07,576 --> 01:13:09,776
- I mean... - How childish!

1980
01:13:09,776 --> 01:13:12,175
- You are too much. - How childish!

1981
01:13:12,205 --> 01:13:14,745
Let's go. Let's pick one of them.

1982
01:13:14,745 --> 01:13:16,675
- Okay. - Pick between these two.

1983
01:13:17,885 --> 01:13:19,186
Why don't you shoot us?

1984
01:13:19,986 --> 01:13:21,715
I am serious. Go to them.

1985
01:13:22,486 --> 01:13:25,055
Whom shall we pick? Ji Hyo or Daniel?

1986
01:13:25,055 --> 01:13:26,055
(They need to decide on the target.)

1987
01:13:26,686 --> 01:13:28,125
Spare Daniel.

1988
01:13:29,726 --> 01:13:31,266
(Daniel, you don't know, right?)

1989
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:33,125
Daniel, you don't know, right?

1990
01:13:34,366 --> 01:13:36,036
Should I show my answer?

1991
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:37,066
Maybe he got it right.

1992
01:13:37,066 --> 01:13:38,205
(If his answer is right, Team Police loses.)

1993
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:40,305
- I would be amazed if he did. - Maybe he got it right.

1994
01:13:40,305 --> 01:13:41,505
I'd be amazed.

1995
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:45,276
(What is Daniel's answer?)

1996
01:13:45,276 --> 01:13:47,276
(Hair)

1997
01:13:47,276 --> 01:13:50,076
(Incorrect)

1998
01:13:51,486 --> 01:13:52,486
Hair.

1999
01:13:53,186 --> 01:13:54,385
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

2000
01:13:54,686 --> 01:13:56,686
- Hair. - It hurts.

2001
01:13:56,686 --> 01:13:57,986
Why did you hit me?

2002
01:13:58,955 --> 01:14:00,696
So Min, why did you hit Sae Ho?

2003
01:14:00,696 --> 01:14:01,925
I was in pain.

2004
01:14:02,625 --> 01:14:06,125
You should have endured it. Why did you take it out on me?

2005
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:07,835
I am sorry.

2006
01:14:09,165 --> 01:14:12,406
Kwang Soo wrote down something different.

2007
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:13,705
- I thought... - Toenail.

2008
01:14:15,175 --> 01:14:17,745
I thought hair was too obvious.

2009
01:14:18,106 --> 01:14:19,345
Tyrannosaurus' claw.

2010
01:14:21,545 --> 01:14:23,016
Read the question.

2011
01:14:23,276 --> 01:14:24,545
This is easy.

2012
01:14:24,845 --> 01:14:28,555
"Complete the titles of the three SBS dramas in order."

2013
01:14:28,555 --> 01:14:32,326
"Secret Blank, Wife's Blank, and My Girlfriend Is Blank."

2014
01:14:32,486 --> 01:14:35,696
- My goodness, this is hard. - Oh, my.

2015
01:14:35,955 --> 01:14:38,066
Everyone knows the answer,

2016
01:14:38,066 --> 01:14:39,726
but some of them will answer incorrectly on purpose.

2017
01:14:39,726 --> 01:14:41,965
It's a psychological warfare.

2018
01:14:41,965 --> 01:14:44,566
(Most of them know the answer.)

2019
01:14:44,566 --> 01:14:45,665
(Shall I get it right or wrong?)

2020
01:14:46,036 --> 01:14:47,436
What is it?

2021
01:14:47,436 --> 01:14:51,375
- Do you think it's hard? - So Min says it is.

2022
01:14:51,446 --> 01:14:52,675
I bet everyone knows the answer.

2023
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:56,476
This is what Sa Yeon said to me.

2024
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:59,385
"Is it 'My Girlfriend Is Sam Soon'?"

2025
01:14:59,385 --> 01:15:01,486
(Is it "My Girlfriend Is Sam Soon"?)

2026
01:15:02,116 --> 01:15:03,385
(You are confusing it with "My Lovely Sam Soon".)

2027
01:15:03,385 --> 01:15:05,786
That's "My Lovely Sam Soon".

2028
01:15:08,696 --> 01:15:09,755
Respect, respect.

2029
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:12,465
Sa Yeon, what do you think the titles are?

2030
01:15:12,465 --> 01:15:15,396
"Secret Garden", "Wife's Outing",

2031
01:15:15,436 --> 01:15:17,266
"My Girlfriend Is Sam Soon".

2032
01:15:18,635 --> 01:15:21,375
(Please love SBS dramas.)

2033
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:24,476
- Respect, respect. - Big respect, big respect.

2034
01:15:24,476 --> 01:15:26,646
- Superman! - You are the hero of variety shows.

2035
01:15:26,646 --> 01:15:27,976
Superman, Superman!

2036
01:15:28,215 --> 01:15:29,745
You finished writing down the answer, right?

2037
01:15:29,745 --> 01:15:31,245
Show us the answer.

2038
01:15:31,946 --> 01:15:34,156
- "Secret Garden". - It is a nine-tailed fox.

2039
01:15:34,156 --> 01:15:35,156
That's the hard one.

2040
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:37,326
I bet people wrote down the wrong answer on purpose.

2041
01:15:37,326 --> 01:15:39,186
They are like that.

2042
01:15:39,186 --> 01:15:41,326
- Yeon Soo would know. - Yes.

2043
01:15:41,326 --> 01:15:42,726
She is in dramas.

2044
01:15:42,726 --> 01:15:44,295
She would be interested in dramas.

2045
01:15:44,295 --> 01:15:46,726
There is the possibility of her answering incorrectly on purpose.

2046
01:15:46,726 --> 01:15:47,736
- On purpose? - Yes.

2047
01:15:47,736 --> 01:15:50,766
Since she hadn't been on the show for a while,

2048
01:15:50,766 --> 01:15:52,536
she would have shown off her knowledge to look cool.

2049
01:15:53,305 --> 01:15:55,036
She would have shown off her knowledge to look cool.

2050
01:15:55,036 --> 01:15:56,305
(Laughing)

2051
01:15:56,305 --> 01:15:57,375
- Don't you agree? - My goodness.

2052
01:15:57,446 --> 01:16:00,076
- I bet she didn't know the answer. - I swear she wrote,

2053
01:16:00,675 --> 01:16:03,545
"My Girlfriend Is a Girl from Gumi".

2054
01:16:04,385 --> 01:16:05,545
"A Girl from Gumi".

2055
01:16:05,545 --> 01:16:08,085
(A slight change makes the title funny.)

2056
01:16:08,085 --> 01:16:09,856
She wrote, "My Girlfriend Is a Girl from Gumi".

2057
01:16:09,856 --> 01:16:12,826
I am sure of it. That's why I strongly recommend...

2058
01:16:12,826 --> 01:16:14,026
- that you choose Yeon Soo. - That's right.

2059
01:16:15,326 --> 01:16:18,766
I don't think she wrote down the answer.

2060
01:16:18,766 --> 01:16:19,866
Yeon Soo.

2061
01:16:19,866 --> 01:16:21,196
Pick Yeon Soo.

2062
01:16:21,196 --> 01:16:22,566
No, no.

2063
01:16:22,566 --> 01:16:25,406
Yeon Soo, when I say the first part, say the second part.

2064
01:16:25,406 --> 01:16:26,566
- "Temptation..." - "Of Wife".

2065
01:16:26,566 --> 01:16:27,576
- "Secret..." - "Garden".

2066
01:16:27,576 --> 01:16:28,576
- "My Girlfriend is..." - "A Gumiho".

2067
01:16:28,576 --> 01:16:29,705
- "Temptation..." - "Of Wife".

2068
01:16:29,705 --> 01:16:30,946
What are you doing?

2069
01:16:30,946 --> 01:16:32,305
(She already knows the answers.)

2070
01:16:32,305 --> 01:16:34,175
He just wanted to talk to her.

2071
01:16:34,845 --> 01:16:36,345
He just wanted to talk to her.

2072
01:16:37,016 --> 01:16:39,245
- You're good. - He wanted to make eye contact.

2073
01:16:40,245 --> 01:16:41,885
He wanted to talk to her.

2074
01:16:42,055 --> 01:16:44,326
Team Yeon Soo. We have to hit them.

2075
01:16:44,326 --> 01:16:45,455
- Okay. - Okay.

2076
01:16:46,186 --> 01:16:47,826
- Yeon Soo doesn't know? - Okay.

2077
01:16:47,826 --> 01:16:49,795
(Did Yeon Soo write down the wrong answer?)

2078
01:16:49,795 --> 01:16:51,526
She might have gotten it wrong on purpose.

2079
01:16:51,526 --> 01:16:52,726
She has to know.

2080
01:16:52,965 --> 01:16:54,665
In 1, 2, 3.

2081
01:16:54,665 --> 01:16:55,766
Oh Yeon Soo.

2082
01:16:57,165 --> 01:16:58,236
It's Ha Yeon Soo.

2083
01:16:58,366 --> 01:16:59,866
(Oh Yeon Soo)

2084
01:17:00,036 --> 01:17:01,135
What is wrong with you?

2085
01:17:01,576 --> 01:17:04,146
Oh Yeon Soo?

2086
01:17:04,146 --> 01:17:05,406
What's wrong with you?

2087
01:17:06,446 --> 01:17:07,845
Can somebody take his wig off?

2088
01:17:07,845 --> 01:17:09,316
Hold on.

2089
01:17:09,316 --> 01:17:11,215
Is he trying to get more camera time?

2090
01:17:11,686 --> 01:17:13,715
I'd be so disappointed.

2091
01:17:13,715 --> 01:17:15,516
I'm sorry.

2092
01:17:15,686 --> 01:17:16,816
My bad.

2093
01:17:18,026 --> 01:17:19,286
In 1, 2, 3.

2094
01:17:19,286 --> 01:17:21,455
- Yeon Soo, you don't know, right? - Yeon Soo, you don't know, right?

2095
01:17:21,455 --> 01:17:26,396
(Did Yeon Soo write down the wrong answer on purpose?)

2096
01:17:26,965 --> 01:17:28,766
(Cheering)

2097
01:17:28,766 --> 01:17:29,866
(Haha and Se Chan cheered. Did she write down the correct answer?)

2098
01:17:29,866 --> 01:17:31,005
I'm suspicious.

2099
01:17:31,335 --> 01:17:32,505
What is it?

2100
01:17:32,505 --> 01:17:36,276
(Garden, Temptation, Gumihong)

2101
01:17:36,276 --> 01:17:37,446
(She wrote "Gumihong" to get it wrong.)

2102
01:17:37,446 --> 01:17:39,776
- "Gumihong"? - "Garden", "Temptation"...

2103
01:17:40,005 --> 01:17:42,616
- "Gumihong". - "Gumihong".

2104
01:17:42,745 --> 01:17:46,585
- "Gumihong". - "Gumihong".

2105
01:17:46,845 --> 01:17:47,986
That hurts so much.

2106
01:17:47,986 --> 01:17:51,186
(Their head hurts, and they lost their chance to win 400 dollars.)

2107
01:17:51,186 --> 01:17:54,555
That was too easy, so I got it wrong on purpose.

2108
01:17:55,326 --> 01:17:56,856
Seok Jin, that was good.

2109
01:17:56,856 --> 01:17:58,766
- You did well. - Sa Yeon guessed it for us.

2110
01:17:58,795 --> 01:18:00,095
- Good job. - An alien?

2111
01:18:00,566 --> 01:18:01,566
You did it on purpose, right?

2112
01:18:01,566 --> 01:18:04,005
- We knew. - I got it wrong on purpose.

2113
01:18:04,005 --> 01:18:05,106
"Gardan"?

2114
01:18:05,465 --> 01:18:07,135
"Secret Gardan", "My Wife is Studying Abroad",

2115
01:18:07,635 --> 01:18:08,906
"My Girlfriend is an Alien".

2116
01:18:09,606 --> 01:18:11,675
I like "My Wife is Studying Abroad".

2117
01:18:12,906 --> 01:18:14,215
(He wants his wife to go somewhere.)

2118
01:18:14,215 --> 01:18:15,646
I like it.

2119
01:18:15,646 --> 01:18:17,545
- I really like that team. - He's crazy.

2120
01:18:17,545 --> 01:18:18,885
"My Wife is Studying Abroad".

2121
01:18:19,016 --> 01:18:20,656
I like that too.

2122
01:18:21,085 --> 01:18:23,516
Please go to South America.

2123
01:18:24,125 --> 01:18:26,955
(Please stay until you get a doctoral degree.)

2124
01:18:28,226 --> 01:18:30,156
This is too easy.

2125
01:18:30,255 --> 01:18:31,526
This is the same.

2126
01:18:31,526 --> 01:18:33,165
(Is this question really easy too?)

2127
01:18:33,165 --> 01:18:34,266
It must be easy.

2128
01:18:36,036 --> 01:18:39,366
"Yeon Soo's nickname is Squirtle. What kind of animal is it?"

2129
01:18:40,536 --> 01:18:41,536
What?

2130
01:18:42,276 --> 01:18:43,375
Really?

2131
01:18:43,976 --> 01:18:45,446
You even have a picture of it.

2132
01:18:45,745 --> 01:18:47,175
That was so kind of you.

2133
01:18:47,245 --> 01:18:49,946
Would we say that's an octopus?

2134
01:18:50,415 --> 01:18:52,245
- You underestimated us. - Is that what you wrote?

2135
01:18:52,516 --> 01:18:53,585
I'm just saying.

2136
01:18:53,686 --> 01:18:55,816
We know.

2137
01:18:55,816 --> 01:18:57,085
(Is Yuchen Gang going with Plan 1?)

2138
01:18:57,085 --> 01:18:59,585
(Okay, they're ready.)

2139
01:19:01,696 --> 01:19:02,856
Are you ready?

2140
01:19:02,856 --> 01:19:06,366
Do you really don't know?

2141
01:19:09,665 --> 01:19:11,805
(Come on, Sa Yeon.)

2142
01:19:11,805 --> 01:19:13,066
What do you mean?

2143
01:19:13,266 --> 01:19:14,875
You can't say it.

2144
01:19:16,076 --> 01:19:18,476
(He wrote down the wrong answer.)

2145
01:19:19,076 --> 01:19:20,446
- This is our strategy. - It is?

2146
01:19:20,576 --> 01:19:22,715
- What are you doing, Sa Yeon? - It's our strategy?

2147
01:19:22,715 --> 01:19:25,116
- We'll go again. - We're sorry.

2148
01:19:25,745 --> 01:19:27,955
We have an internal enemy. I don't know what to do.

2149
01:19:30,955 --> 01:19:33,085
She doesn't say it,

2150
01:19:33,156 --> 01:19:34,455
but if you write the wrong thing...

2151
01:19:34,625 --> 01:19:36,125
(She's not satisfied.)

2152
01:19:36,495 --> 01:19:37,995
Please look elsewhere. I'm sorry.

2153
01:19:38,625 --> 01:19:40,536
- I'm sorry. - Her face it like...

2154
01:19:40,536 --> 01:19:41,635
My gosh.

2155
01:19:43,635 --> 01:19:46,305
Ji Hyo, let me tell you this.

2156
01:19:46,305 --> 01:19:47,635
We wrote down the correct answer,

2157
01:19:47,635 --> 01:19:48,875
so please don't bother us.

2158
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:50,106
I'm serious.

2159
01:19:50,106 --> 01:19:51,776
We wrote down the correct answer too.

2160
01:19:52,345 --> 01:19:53,745
We did.

2161
01:19:54,476 --> 01:19:55,845
There's no reason for us to get it wrong.

2162
01:19:55,946 --> 01:19:57,686
What did you write, Seok Jin?

2163
01:19:58,345 --> 01:19:59,585
Me?

2164
01:19:59,585 --> 01:20:01,555
I wrote "terrapin".

2165
01:20:01,915 --> 01:20:04,385
(What?)

2166
01:20:04,486 --> 01:20:05,955
Is that what you wrote?

2167
01:20:06,085 --> 01:20:07,425
That's what I wrote.

2168
01:20:07,425 --> 01:20:09,295
- You're not making sense. - Why not?

2169
01:20:09,455 --> 01:20:10,995
We said...

2170
01:20:10,995 --> 01:20:13,965
- we know the answer. - What are you going to do?

2171
01:20:14,135 --> 01:20:16,036
What's our plan? Share it with us.

2172
01:20:16,266 --> 01:20:18,236
What's our plan? Did we get it right or wrong?

2173
01:20:18,635 --> 01:20:20,835
(Either they didn't talk it out, or he thought it was a terrapin.)

2174
01:20:20,835 --> 01:20:23,236
Are we going to get it right or wrong?

2175
01:20:23,576 --> 01:20:25,205
- I... - What's our decision?

2176
01:20:25,205 --> 01:20:27,976
I actually don't remember what I wrote.

2177
01:20:28,016 --> 01:20:29,545
Kwang Soo, did you write the correct answer?

2178
01:20:30,845 --> 01:20:33,286
Did you write the wrong answer or the correct one?

2179
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:36,915
You said you wrote the correct answer.

2180
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:39,786
Choose one. You said you wrote the correct answer.

2181
01:20:39,786 --> 01:20:41,156
It's better to go back and forth.

2182
01:20:41,156 --> 01:20:42,755
Just do that.

2183
01:20:43,295 --> 01:20:46,026
- What did you write? - You can't ask now.

2184
01:20:46,026 --> 01:20:47,835
You can't ask now.

2185
01:20:49,295 --> 01:20:51,266
You can't ask now.

2186
01:20:51,465 --> 01:20:52,936
- He can, Sa Yeon. - He can?

2187
01:20:53,366 --> 01:20:56,106
(What's the whole point of this game then?)

2188
01:20:56,106 --> 01:20:58,005
- What did she say? - He can?

2189
01:20:58,005 --> 01:20:59,305
She's like,

2190
01:20:59,545 --> 01:21:01,316
"You can't ask now."

2191
01:21:01,576 --> 01:21:04,786
- This is the time to ask. - Is that it?

2192
01:21:06,545 --> 01:21:07,656
It is.

2193
01:21:07,656 --> 01:21:09,215
Let's get started. Let's go that way.

2194
01:21:09,356 --> 01:21:10,415
- Towards us? - Yes.

2195
01:21:10,786 --> 01:21:12,826
We'll do this. "You all know, right?"

2196
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:15,026
(Yuchen Gang, You all know, right?)

2197
01:21:15,026 --> 01:21:16,396
"You all know, right?"

2198
01:21:16,396 --> 01:21:17,495
One...

2199
01:21:17,495 --> 01:21:18,995
(The answer is obviously "turtle". They can get it wrong on purpose.)

2200
01:21:18,995 --> 01:21:20,095
Two...

2201
01:21:20,095 --> 01:21:22,135
(They probably wrote the correct answer.)

2202
01:21:22,135 --> 01:21:23,196
Three.

2203
01:21:24,536 --> 01:21:25,665
Turtle?

2204
01:21:27,005 --> 01:21:29,736
(He wrote "frog".)

2205
01:21:33,875 --> 01:21:36,446
(Kwang Soo got it wrong, so they didn't know it.)

2206
01:21:36,446 --> 01:21:37,616
(Mungdol Gang is out since 2 people got eliminated.)

2207
01:21:37,616 --> 01:21:39,415
- What did you write? - That was so close.

2208
01:21:40,116 --> 01:21:41,316
It's between us now.

2209
01:21:41,316 --> 01:21:45,286
(It's Yuchen Gang versus Police Department.)

2210
01:21:45,385 --> 01:21:48,495
"When people draw, they use 4B pencils".

2211
01:21:48,555 --> 01:21:51,965
- "What does B stand for?" - Okay.

2212
01:21:54,665 --> 01:21:56,936
(Isn't this it?)

2213
01:21:59,236 --> 01:22:00,805
Don't look. They're looking.

2214
01:22:01,276 --> 01:22:03,205
So Min saw everything.

2215
01:22:03,205 --> 01:22:04,705
(She's flustered.)

2216
01:22:06,906 --> 01:22:08,675
They're out.

2217
01:22:09,245 --> 01:22:10,885
It doesn't matter?

2218
01:22:12,085 --> 01:22:13,186
Is this...

2219
01:22:13,585 --> 01:22:14,755
a dream?

2220
01:22:15,616 --> 01:22:17,425
(Thanks for making us laugh every round.)

2221
01:22:17,425 --> 01:22:18,585
I'll show you the answer.

2222
01:22:18,986 --> 01:22:20,495
(What does B stand for?)

2223
01:22:20,495 --> 01:22:22,396
(Black)

2224
01:22:22,726 --> 01:22:23,826
I got it right.

2225
01:22:23,925 --> 01:22:25,465
How did I get it right?

2226
01:22:25,726 --> 01:22:27,766
- He got it right. - He's amazing.

2227
01:22:27,766 --> 01:22:29,896
- He got it right. - How did I get this right?

2228
01:22:29,896 --> 01:22:31,665
(As soon as he heard the question...)

2229
01:22:31,665 --> 01:22:33,236
Is it black?

2230
01:22:33,805 --> 01:22:34,936
Hold on.

2231
01:22:35,635 --> 01:22:37,946
- He got it right. - He said it was black,

2232
01:22:38,406 --> 01:22:40,675
but Ji Hyo was like, "That doesn't make sense."

2233
01:22:42,276 --> 01:22:43,946
(It does make sense.)

2234
01:22:43,946 --> 01:22:46,245
I told him that. "Does that even make sense?"

2235
01:22:46,816 --> 01:22:49,055
Jae Seok, did you know the answer?

2236
01:22:49,055 --> 01:22:50,356
(Did Jae Seok know the answer?)

2237
01:22:50,356 --> 01:22:51,425
- Me? - Yes.

2238
01:22:52,085 --> 01:22:53,186
I did.

2239
01:22:53,686 --> 01:22:55,226
Did you used to draw?

2240
01:22:55,326 --> 01:22:56,856
I didn't but this is basic knowledge.

2241
01:22:57,055 --> 01:22:59,066
Is this basic knowledge?

2242
01:22:59,066 --> 01:23:00,425
Of course.

2243
01:23:00,425 --> 01:23:02,396
Does Ji Hyo have no basic knowledge?

2244
01:23:03,766 --> 01:23:06,406
No, to me I mean.

2245
01:23:06,465 --> 01:23:07,635
Kwang Soo, you didn't know, right?

2246
01:23:08,276 --> 01:23:09,675
I thought it was...

2247
01:23:09,805 --> 01:23:11,076
- What did you think it was? - You didn't know.

2248
01:23:11,976 --> 01:23:14,316
- You were writing down something. - You were very busy.

2249
01:23:14,316 --> 01:23:16,675
(You were scribbling something down.)

2250
01:23:17,186 --> 01:23:18,686
I wrote down "belly hair".

2251
01:23:18,986 --> 01:23:20,116
I'm being honest.

2252
01:23:20,555 --> 01:23:22,486
- That's what I wrote. - You did?

2253
01:23:22,616 --> 01:23:25,186
But I was going to go to an art school.

2254
01:23:25,755 --> 01:23:28,555
He was planning to go to an art school.

2255
01:23:28,555 --> 01:23:30,255
Did you really write "belly hair"?

2256
01:23:30,595 --> 01:23:33,465
- No, I knew. - He did write that though.

2257
01:23:33,465 --> 01:23:35,665
- I did really write it. - He was joking.

2258
01:23:35,866 --> 01:23:36,936
- After he saw it... - I knew it, but...

2259
01:23:36,936 --> 01:23:38,866
- Why are you getting scolded? - I mean...

2260
01:23:39,205 --> 01:23:40,576
He wrote the wrong answer.

2261
01:23:40,576 --> 01:23:41,875
This is a movie.

2262
01:23:41,875 --> 01:23:44,005
- This is a scene from a movie. - Right. Detective, sir.

2263
01:23:44,106 --> 01:23:45,606
- Hold on. - Hold on.

2264
01:23:45,805 --> 01:23:48,016
We're just trying to figure it out.

2265
01:23:48,016 --> 01:23:50,516
We're sorry. He thought he was a detective.

2266
01:23:50,715 --> 01:23:53,486
We're not filming "The Outlaws".

2267
01:23:54,356 --> 01:23:55,415
Boss,

2268
01:23:55,555 --> 01:23:57,055
let's do the Room of Truth.

2269
01:24:00,186 --> 01:24:01,255
(By that, do you mean...)

2270
01:24:01,255 --> 01:24:02,625
Shall we?

2271
01:24:02,826 --> 01:24:04,226
- Byung Sik. - Yes, sir.

2272
01:24:04,766 --> 01:24:05,965
Let's go to the Room of Truth.

2273
01:24:07,665 --> 01:24:11,736
(Once you're in it, you have to tell the truth.)

2274
01:24:11,736 --> 01:24:13,906
(This is it.)

2275
01:24:15,375 --> 01:24:16,906
- Should we? - Hey.

2276
01:24:17,245 --> 01:24:18,345
Let's go to the Room of Truth.

2277
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:19,675
- Who? Me? - The Room of Truth.

2278
01:24:20,106 --> 01:24:21,946
Did you write down "belly hair" or not?

2279
01:24:21,946 --> 01:24:22,946
(He's speechless.)

2280
01:24:22,946 --> 01:24:24,146
- It fits you well. - Come on.

2281
01:24:24,146 --> 01:24:25,646
- Did you write it or not? - What?

2282
01:24:26,085 --> 01:24:28,616
Did you write down "black",

2283
01:24:28,915 --> 01:24:30,316
or did you not change it?

2284
01:24:30,316 --> 01:24:31,555
- I don't remember. - Okay.

2285
01:24:31,755 --> 01:24:33,356
(Tell us the truth.)

2286
01:24:36,495 --> 01:24:38,896
(I remember now.)

2287
01:24:38,896 --> 01:24:40,736
Do you remember?

2288
01:24:40,965 --> 01:24:43,595
- Wait. - What are you doing?

2289
01:24:44,236 --> 01:24:46,066
It split into half.

2290
01:24:46,406 --> 01:24:49,005
- What was that? - The Room of Truth.

2291
01:24:49,076 --> 01:24:50,646
What was that?

2292
01:24:50,646 --> 01:24:53,045
- How's this the Room of Truth? - Didn't you watch the movie?

2293
01:24:53,776 --> 01:24:55,146
The Room of Truth.

2294
01:24:55,646 --> 01:24:56,946
We'll announce it now.

2295
01:24:56,946 --> 01:24:58,286
- Let's go. - Go, Haha.

2296
01:24:59,286 --> 01:25:00,856
- Do we get hit? - Yes.

2297
01:25:00,856 --> 01:25:03,755
(They decide to attack Yuchen Gang.)

2298
01:25:06,326 --> 01:25:09,396
(He said this is basic knowledge.)

2299
01:25:09,396 --> 01:25:12,425
(If he wanted to go into arts, this is a piece of cake.)

2300
01:25:12,425 --> 01:25:13,795
- In 1, 2, 3. - I'm not scared.

2301
01:25:13,795 --> 01:25:15,736
- Kwang Soo, you don't know, right? - Kwang Soo, you don't know, right?

2302
01:25:17,366 --> 01:25:19,766
(If he wrote "black", Yuchen Gang wings.)

2303
01:25:19,766 --> 01:25:20,805
- Should I show it? - Yes.

2304
01:25:21,276 --> 01:25:23,906
(He was so confident. Did he write "black"?)

2305
01:25:24,805 --> 01:25:27,245
(He wrote "bright".)

2306
01:25:27,245 --> 01:25:28,715
"Bright"? What?

2307
01:25:28,715 --> 01:25:30,486
- Okay. - In 1, 2, 3.

2308
01:25:30,486 --> 01:25:32,186
(Police Department is tied with Yuchen Gang.)

2309
01:25:33,085 --> 01:25:34,686
That was so strong.

2310
01:25:34,686 --> 01:25:35,786
I wrote "bright" too.

2311
01:25:35,786 --> 01:25:38,255
- He told me to write his. - Yes, "bright".

2312
01:25:38,286 --> 01:25:40,055
He said it was the correct answer.

2313
01:25:42,226 --> 01:25:44,196
This is the last question.

2314
01:25:44,196 --> 01:25:45,566
This will be the last question.

2315
01:25:45,595 --> 01:25:46,826
These two teams are tied.

2316
01:25:46,826 --> 01:25:47,835
(It's the final round between these two teams.)

2317
01:25:47,995 --> 01:25:49,436
- Do we attack? - Yes.

2318
01:25:49,536 --> 01:25:52,066
- Please come forward. - Last one.

2319
01:25:54,076 --> 01:25:55,705
We picked a good question.

2320
01:25:55,736 --> 01:25:57,245
"In Estonia, when you raise cattle,"

2321
01:25:57,245 --> 01:25:59,076
"you must pay a certain tax".

2322
01:25:59,076 --> 01:26:00,146
"What is this?"

2323
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:08,555
(Estonia? Cattle? Tax?)

2324
01:26:10,656 --> 01:26:14,125
(They look clueless. What could be the answer?)

2325
01:26:14,555 --> 01:26:15,826
Just say anything.

2326
01:26:15,826 --> 01:26:17,826
(We're done already.)

2327
01:26:18,295 --> 01:26:19,396
Foot smell tax?

2328
01:26:21,736 --> 01:26:23,736
Sae Ho said it was Lee Moon Sae.

2329
01:26:24,965 --> 01:26:27,276
- I'll always stay with - I know the answer.

2330
01:26:27,276 --> 01:26:29,036
Yuchen Gang

2331
01:26:29,036 --> 01:26:30,106
He's so funny.

2332
01:26:30,106 --> 01:26:32,175
I won't leave you

2333
01:26:32,175 --> 01:26:33,245
(They love this question.)

2334
01:26:33,245 --> 01:26:34,245
Good job.

2335
01:26:34,245 --> 01:26:35,316
(Daniel is cute.)

2336
01:26:35,345 --> 01:26:37,316
- It's so fun watching this. - Right?

2337
01:26:37,616 --> 01:26:39,686
(They're having a discussion.)

2338
01:26:39,686 --> 01:26:42,555
You need a lot of water to raise cattle.

2339
01:26:43,715 --> 01:26:46,656
They poop a lot,

2340
01:26:46,885 --> 01:26:49,726
- so it pollutes the environment. - Pollution tax.

2341
01:26:49,795 --> 01:26:52,125
Wait. Look. I think it's...

2342
01:26:52,125 --> 01:26:56,335
air pollution. Their gas...

2343
01:26:56,335 --> 01:26:58,266
- That's what I mean. - That's it. So...

2344
01:26:58,266 --> 01:27:00,335
(Tax on cattle's gas? What is the correct answer?)

2345
01:27:00,335 --> 01:27:01,875
Here's the answer.

2346
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:02,906
It's hard.

2347
01:27:02,906 --> 01:27:04,375
(What is the tax on raising cattle?)

2348
01:27:04,375 --> 01:27:06,446
(Flatulence tax)

2349
01:27:07,005 --> 01:27:08,276
- I was right. - "Flatulence tax"?

2350
01:27:08,415 --> 01:27:09,516
What?

2351
01:27:10,446 --> 01:27:11,446
(It looks like they got it right.)

2352
01:27:11,446 --> 01:27:12,486
What?

2353
01:27:13,486 --> 01:27:15,116
(They look suspicious.)

2354
01:27:15,116 --> 01:27:19,125
(There must be somebody who got it wrong.)

2355
01:27:19,125 --> 01:27:20,226
- Se Chan. - Yes.

2356
01:27:20,226 --> 01:27:21,295
Did you get it right?

2357
01:27:21,656 --> 01:27:23,055
Yes, I did.

2358
01:27:23,055 --> 01:27:24,165
- Did you write "flatulence tax"? - Yes.

2359
01:27:24,165 --> 01:27:25,526
Did you spell it correctly?

2360
01:27:25,925 --> 01:27:28,495
I'm bad in spelling, so I got it wrong.

2361
01:27:28,595 --> 01:27:30,566
- Oh, we can ask like this. - We can.

2362
01:27:30,566 --> 01:27:31,606
You didn't know how to spell it?

2363
01:27:31,606 --> 01:27:34,005
We've been doing this for 1.5 hours.

2364
01:27:34,276 --> 01:27:35,436
- We're done now. - We are?

2365
01:27:35,436 --> 01:27:36,606
- Yes. - This is the last question.

2366
01:27:37,036 --> 01:27:38,276
You should ask Jong Kook.

2367
01:27:38,276 --> 01:27:39,276
(She finally understands the rules and participates.)

2368
01:27:39,276 --> 01:27:42,076
Jong Kook, did you spell it right?

2369
01:27:42,576 --> 01:27:44,845
- I wrote something else. - See?

2370
01:27:44,986 --> 01:27:47,415
(I wrote something else.)

2371
01:27:47,616 --> 01:27:49,455
- He's so honest. - Jong Kook...

2372
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:51,786
(What game are you playing, Sa Yeon?)

2373
01:27:51,786 --> 01:27:53,896
- He might be lying. - Right.

2374
01:27:54,095 --> 01:27:56,125
- Really? - He might be lying.

2375
01:27:56,696 --> 01:27:58,226
(Jong Kook looks truthful.)

2376
01:27:58,226 --> 01:28:00,165
He looks truthful.

2377
01:28:00,465 --> 01:28:02,366
- I'm sure about Se Chan. - He got it wrong?

2378
01:28:02,366 --> 01:28:04,736
I'm pretty certain about Se Chan.

2379
01:28:05,036 --> 01:28:07,875
He couldn't smile properly.

2380
01:28:07,875 --> 01:28:09,135
(What did Se Chan write?)

2381
01:28:09,205 --> 01:28:11,576
Se Chan. In 1, 2, 3.

2382
01:28:11,576 --> 01:28:12,606
- You don't know, right? - You don't know, right?

2383
01:28:13,675 --> 01:28:16,476
(What did Se Chan write?)

2384
01:28:16,476 --> 01:28:18,245
If we win, we get 400 dollars, right?

2385
01:28:18,245 --> 01:28:23,686
(This is the last round. Who will take 400 dollars?)

2386
01:28:23,755 --> 01:28:25,526
- Se Chan, you don't know, right? - You don't know, right?

2387
01:28:28,526 --> 01:28:30,055
(Pollution tax)

2388
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:31,995
(He's wrong.)

2389
01:28:32,965 --> 01:28:33,995
(Police Department is out.)

2390
01:28:33,995 --> 01:28:35,236
Pollution tax?

2391
01:28:36,165 --> 01:28:38,205
- What did you write? - That was difficult.

2392
01:28:38,205 --> 01:28:39,436
- Pollution tax. - Pollution tax?

2393
01:28:39,536 --> 01:28:41,536
So the winning team is...

2394
01:28:42,635 --> 01:28:43,946
Sa Yeon's team.

2395
01:28:43,946 --> 01:28:45,705
(Yuchen Gang wins.)

2396
01:28:45,705 --> 01:28:47,646
- Our team is the best. - Good job.

2397
01:28:49,175 --> 01:28:50,175
Flatulence?

2398
01:28:50,175 --> 01:28:52,646
The winning team's boss is Sa Yeon,

2399
01:28:52,646 --> 01:28:54,486
so she'll take the money.

2400
01:28:54,486 --> 01:28:56,555
You can divide it up in any way you like.

2401
01:28:56,555 --> 01:28:58,925
You have already used the Revolution Card.

2402
01:29:01,026 --> 01:29:02,095
(That means...)

2403
01:29:02,095 --> 01:29:03,495
She can keep it all.

2404
01:29:03,755 --> 01:29:05,726
That's good. I'll keep it all.

2405
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:07,635
You can.

2406
01:29:07,635 --> 01:29:10,606
(Yuchen Gang's day was filled with betrayals.)

2407
01:29:11,005 --> 01:29:13,505
This is your last chance to use the Revolution Card.

2408
01:29:13,505 --> 01:29:16,205
- What is Daniel's team going to do? - I got the answer.

2409
01:29:16,205 --> 01:29:17,976
How much time can you give us?

2410
01:29:18,045 --> 01:29:19,805
- I'll give you 10 seconds. - What?

2411
01:29:20,545 --> 01:29:23,345
- 10 seconds? - That's a lot of time.

2412
01:29:23,715 --> 01:29:26,186
Hasn't it passed already? Hold on. What do we do?

2413
01:29:26,186 --> 01:29:27,255
(They're confused. They only have one chance.)

2414
01:29:27,255 --> 01:29:29,055
This is too cruel.

2415
01:29:29,055 --> 01:29:30,786
- No. - Try it.

2416
01:29:31,326 --> 01:29:32,755
Use it, Sae Ho.

2417
01:29:33,055 --> 01:29:34,156
- Sae Ho. - Sae Ho, use it.

2418
01:29:34,156 --> 01:29:35,196
Just go for it.

2419
01:29:36,326 --> 01:29:37,396
- Please decide. - Sae Ho,

2420
01:29:37,526 --> 01:29:38,795
I can...

2421
01:29:38,795 --> 01:29:42,366
This is the last chance. I'm scared of this card. Take it.

2422
01:29:42,665 --> 01:29:43,965
You can...

2423
01:29:44,165 --> 01:29:46,366
either take it out or zip it up.

2424
01:29:46,906 --> 01:29:47,906
- It's up to me? - Yes.

2425
01:29:47,906 --> 01:29:48,976
I'll use it.

2426
01:29:48,976 --> 01:29:50,545
(It's up to me? I'll use it.)

2427
01:29:51,576 --> 01:29:52,576
I'll use it.

2428
01:29:52,576 --> 01:29:54,045
(She uses the Revolution Card without hesitating.)

2429
01:29:54,045 --> 01:29:55,875
She doesn't hesitate like a tiger moth.

2430
01:29:57,385 --> 01:29:58,415
It's a revolt.

2431
01:29:59,186 --> 01:30:00,715
You used the Revolution Card.

2432
01:30:01,186 --> 01:30:04,255
I'll tell you the amount in Daniel's digital moneybox.

2433
01:30:04,255 --> 01:30:05,286
Out of 1,200 dollars...

2434
01:30:06,585 --> 01:30:08,755
(Everyone trusted Boss Kang.)

2435
01:30:08,755 --> 01:30:10,795
I don't think our boss will lie.

2436
01:30:11,266 --> 01:30:13,625
I trust Boss Kang.

2437
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:16,965
I think he'll be clean and fair.

2438
01:30:17,205 --> 01:30:18,266
I'll be fair.

2439
01:30:20,576 --> 01:30:22,835
The amount Daniel has...

2440
01:30:22,835 --> 01:30:24,476
(Did Boss Kang...)

2441
01:30:24,476 --> 01:30:26,446
(divide 1,200 dollars...)

2442
01:30:26,446 --> 01:30:29,745
(equally amongst his team members?)

2443
01:30:29,946 --> 01:30:31,385
(Next week)

2444
01:30:32,245 --> 01:30:35,055

(The real war begins now.)

2446
01:30:40,896 --> 01:30:42,125
Are you by yourself?

2447
01:30:42,125 --> 01:30:43,495
- Hold on. - I think we are first place.

2448
01:30:43,495 --> 01:30:45,165
(What would be the result of this battle...)

2449
01:30:45,165 --> 01:30:49,095
(of becoming number 1?)

2450
01:30:49,995 --> 01:30:51,465
This is brutal.

2451
01:30:53,805 --> 01:30:55,576
(That was scary.)

2452
01:30:56,505 --> 01:30:57,646
(And)

2453
01:30:58,576 --> 01:31:04,045

2458

(is a hostage?)

2459
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:17,366
(He got his memory stolen.)

2460
01:31:18,165 --> 01:31:22,236
(This is not your memory.)

2461

(If you don't find the memory thief, somebody's memory is in danger.)
