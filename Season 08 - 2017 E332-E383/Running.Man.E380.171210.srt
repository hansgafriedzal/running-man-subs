1
00:00:06,393 --> 00:00:08,228
My gosh, I like this place. This is nice.

2
00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:10,764
(A secret base of heroes in Busan)

3
00:00:10,764 --> 00:00:11,898
Hello.

4
00:00:11,898 --> 00:00:14,968
- Hi. - Hello.

5
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:16,369
- Goodness. - We are in Busan.

6
00:00:16,703 --> 00:00:19,139
We get to film this week's episode in Busan.

7
00:00:19,472 --> 00:00:21,908
- It's definitely warm in Busan. - It is warm here.

8
00:00:21,908 --> 00:00:24,811
- It got warmer. It's not cold. - I agree. It's not cold.

9
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:27,247
Jong Kook, but it's not warm enough to be in such outfit. Are you okay?

10
00:00:27,247 --> 00:00:29,349
(You're not wearing a winter coat.)

11
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:32,018
(It's spring for him. He's not wearing a padded jacket.)

12
00:00:32,018 --> 00:00:33,586
I agree. You still need a winter jacket.

13
00:00:33,586 --> 00:00:36,990
This is the outfit I had on when I left for the shoot.

14
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,327
I got on the KTX in this outfit and arrived here.

15
00:00:40,327 --> 00:00:42,228
When I walked in, my outfit coordinator said,

16
00:00:42,495 --> 00:00:45,532
"Jong Kook, the outfit I brought looks the same. Just wear yours."

17
00:00:45,532 --> 00:00:48,134
(Jong Kook, the outfit I brought looks the same. Just wear yours.)

18
00:00:48,802 --> 00:00:50,570
- That's too much. - I said, "Really?"

19
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,073
So I agreed to keep my outfit on.

20
00:00:53,073 --> 00:00:56,409
- Why on earth... - I woke up at 3:30am.

21
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:59,079
My mom cooked me the loin end.

22
00:00:59,145 --> 00:01:00,513
- I had the end loin. - At 3:30am?

23
00:01:00,513 --> 00:01:01,981
- At 3:30am? - Yes.

24
00:01:02,782 --> 00:01:03,883
You ate the loin end at 3:30am?

25
00:01:03,883 --> 00:01:05,552
Yes, I had that for breakfast.

26
00:01:05,552 --> 00:01:07,354
Only your mother can cook for you at three in the morning.

27
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:09,989
- She did it because you're her son. - This is hilarious.

28
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:11,825
It's been two years since I had breakfast.

29
00:01:11,825 --> 00:01:14,928
(Forget about the beef. Last time I had breakfast was 2 years ago.)

30
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:17,030
She did it because she's your mother.

31
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,799
Seok Jin is on the intermittent fast.

32
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,468
- Sure. - Seriously?

33
00:01:21,468 --> 00:01:22,802
That wasn't his choice though.

34
00:01:23,336 --> 00:01:25,271
- It's true. - He can cook breakfast himself.

35
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:27,474
- Sorry? - Seok Jin weighs about 47kg, right?

36
00:01:27,474 --> 00:01:28,475
(His weight is that of an elementary schooler.)

37
00:01:28,475 --> 00:01:29,776
(No, I weigh more than 50kg.)

38
00:01:29,776 --> 00:01:31,611
- What are you talking about? - He weighs over 50kg.

39
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:35,281
Today's race will be held in Busan.

40
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:38,918
- Let's meet today's guests first. - We're having guests today?

41
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:40,987
(No way! We have surprise guests today?)

42
00:01:40,987 --> 00:01:42,389
- Who do you think it is? - They came all the way to Busan?

43
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:43,890
- We have guests today? - Who are they?

44
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,891
Okay!

45
00:01:44,924 --> 00:01:47,160
You're getting your hopes up again. Don't do that, Se Chan.

46
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,361
Why not?

47
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:50,330
Today's guests, please come on out.

48
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,801
(Two guests who will join the outing in Busan are behind the door.)

49
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:55,802
- Who are they? - Who are they?

50
00:01:55,802 --> 00:01:57,404
(Who are the surprise guests?)

51
00:01:57,404 --> 00:02:00,240
- My gosh, how long has it been? - We haven't seen you for ages!

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,175
(Their silhouettes are enough to excite them.)

53
00:02:03,176 --> 00:02:05,078
Kang Han Na. It's Han Na...

54
00:02:05,378 --> 00:02:06,413
My goodness!

55
00:02:06,713 --> 00:02:08,214
How long has it been?

56
00:02:08,214 --> 00:02:09,282
(Kang Han Na and Kyung Su Jin)

57
00:02:10,016 --> 00:02:15,989
(Unusual Han Na and Competitive Su Jin brought heat to Running Man.)

58
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:17,390
(This time, they are in Busan!)

59
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,825
- Long time no see. - It's great to see you.

60
00:02:18,825 --> 00:02:20,093
- Have you been well? - Hello.

61
00:02:20,093 --> 00:02:21,861
- Have you been well? - It's nice to meet you.

62
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:23,930
- Hi. - It's been a while.

63
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,165
(Did you see Seok Jin?)

64
00:02:25,632 --> 00:02:27,600
My goodness. Hang on a second.

65
00:02:27,634 --> 00:02:29,035
- I just saw... - What is it?

66
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:30,770
- I just saw something hilarious. - What is going on?

67
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,406
- Seok Jin said to Han Na... - What happened?

68
00:02:33,773 --> 00:02:35,074
"It's nice to meet you."

69
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:37,944
- He was Han Na's partner. - Seok Jin, you don't remember her?

70
00:02:38,211 --> 00:02:40,313
- She played games as your partner. - With me?

71
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:46,419
(Seok Jin and Han Na spent the whole day as each other's partners.)

72
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:49,789
He was all polite and said, "It's nice to meet you."

73
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:51,624
(He was overly polite.)

74
00:02:52,592 --> 00:02:53,593
Han Na...

75
00:02:54,327 --> 00:02:56,162
I remember now. We had kalguksu with Ji Hyo.

76
00:02:56,162 --> 00:02:58,198
- Stop it now, Seok Jin. - That's enough.

77
00:02:58,198 --> 00:03:00,300
- Try to remember her. - How can I remember everyone?

78
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,335
But how could you not remember your former partner?

79
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:05,672
All right. I'm sure you all know how Su Jin is.

80
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:07,373
Whenever she joined us on our show,

81
00:03:07,373 --> 00:03:09,175
she showed us great games and got very competitive.

82
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:11,110
- She's really competitive. - She is indeed.

83
00:03:11,244 --> 00:03:13,847
She's the one who blocked the elevator with shoulders, right?

84
00:03:14,614 --> 00:03:18,585
(She's a true fighter who doesn't hesitate to go against machines.)

85
00:03:18,585 --> 00:03:20,620
- I really admire her. - I didn't know she was daring.

86
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:22,589
During the shoot, I saw the whites of her eyes a lot,

87
00:03:22,589 --> 00:03:23,990
but I didn't see them on TV.

88
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,426
- You saw the whites of her eyes? - I've never seen eyes turning.

89
00:03:26,426 --> 00:03:28,361
- Stop lying. - She was just trying her best.

90
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:31,264
Su Jin and Han Na are joining us today.

91
00:03:31,264 --> 00:03:32,799
(Next up is Han Na whom only Seok Jin hasn't met.)

92
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,534
- She is a dancer. - She's very unusual.

93
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:38,605
You must've had an early start in order to join us in Busan.

94
00:03:38,872 --> 00:03:41,975
Actually, I'm currently filming a JTBC drama in Busan.

95
00:03:41,975 --> 00:03:44,277
- It's called "Just Between Lovers". - Really?

96
00:03:44,277 --> 00:03:47,113
(No, I'm filming a JTBC drama in Busan.)

97
00:03:47,213 --> 00:03:49,415
- You can't promote it that bluntly. - This is a bit...

98
00:03:49,415 --> 00:03:51,818
She can't be too blunt about this.

99
00:03:51,818 --> 00:03:53,019
It hasn't aired yet.

100
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:54,420
- You might not know. - It hasn't started yet.

101
00:03:54,888 --> 00:03:56,923
- The promotion sounded rushed. - I agree.

102
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,591
It was too direct.

103
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,494
Did you not think that this could be edited out when you said that?

104
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:02,495
(Did you think that at all?)

105
00:04:02,495 --> 00:04:04,330
- Please don't edit it out. - Let this part air.

106
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,099
We will air this clip,

107
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:08,268
but you have to include, "Running Man" in your line.

108
00:04:08,268 --> 00:04:10,336
(Include "Running Man" in your line in exchange.)

109
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:11,404
Well...

110
00:04:11,404 --> 00:04:14,140
- "I saw Running Man yesterday." - Please do that.

111
00:04:14,374 --> 00:04:16,709
- Okay. - Add, "It airs on SBS at 6:30pm."

112
00:04:16,776 --> 00:04:20,914
You will have an intense mind game in order to win the prize money.

113
00:04:20,914 --> 00:04:22,715
The race is called, Same Money, Different Dreams Race.

114
00:04:22,715 --> 00:04:24,784
(Same Money, Different Dreams Race)

115
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:27,086
You will divide into two teams, and through games,

116
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:28,655
the winning team will be determined.

117
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:31,591
The individual with the most money in the winning team...

118
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:33,359
will be the final victor.

119
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:36,963
(The player with the most amount of money in the winning team will win.)

120
00:04:37,163 --> 00:04:41,234
The victor will receive the tenfold amount of the leftover money.

121
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:44,771
The victor can choose four members who will receive the water bomb.

122
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:46,139
- Four members? - Yes.

123
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,207
(The victor will win the money and pick four members for the penalty.)

124
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:50,643
- Water bomb? - One from the winning team...

125
00:04:50,643 --> 00:04:53,212
and three from the losing team will face the penalty.

126
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:58,151
(1 from the winning team and 3 from the losing team will be chosen.)

127
00:04:58,151 --> 00:04:59,919
If I face water bombs in Busan...

128
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,454
(He's worried.)

129
00:05:01,454 --> 00:05:03,456
- You're already thinking about it? - Try to win the game... Hey.

130
00:05:03,456 --> 00:05:05,158
- No. - You always think about penalties?

131
00:05:05,158 --> 00:05:06,726
- Don't think about the penalties. - My outfit coordinator...

132
00:05:06,726 --> 00:05:10,096
Whenever we have this kind of penalty,

133
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:12,398
my outfit coordinate always tells me to bring extra underwear.

134
00:05:12,532 --> 00:05:14,667
- Why does she think I'll get it? - You always get the water bomb.

135
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:15,969
Why would you assume that it's me?

136
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:18,271
I have about 40 underpants in the trunk of my car.

137
00:05:18,972 --> 00:05:20,406
(You and I are in the same boat.)

138
00:05:20,406 --> 00:05:23,276
Before we start the race, we'll decide the teams.

139
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:25,979
Today's guests, Su Jin and Han Na,

140
00:05:26,145 --> 00:05:29,582
will each become team leaders and scout players you want.

141
00:05:29,582 --> 00:05:30,917
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - I should make good impressions.

142
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:32,852
The way you scout the members is simple.

143
00:05:32,852 --> 00:05:35,221
You'll write down the members you want and submit it to us.

144
00:05:35,355 --> 00:05:38,024
You can take the members who don't overlap on your lists to your team.

145
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,960
The winning team of Song Ji Hyo Game will get to scout...

146
00:05:41,294 --> 00:05:44,530
overlapping members and members who haven't been chosen.

147
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,965
(The winning team will get to choose first.)

148
00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:48,534
(The game is named after Ji Hyo who's the best at talking nonsense.)

149
00:05:48,534 --> 00:05:52,338
(The players must provide 3 absurd answers within 5 seconds.)

150
00:05:52,538 --> 00:05:53,973
Before the announcement,

151
00:05:53,973 --> 00:05:56,275
Ji Hyo and So Min...

152
00:05:56,275 --> 00:05:58,144
- will demonstrate the game. - Great.

153
00:05:58,144 --> 00:06:00,580
- After the game, the winner can... - They'll play the game?

154
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,148
choose the team she wants.

155
00:06:02,782 --> 00:06:05,084
- This is too hard. - If they go against each other,

156
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:06,285
it will be crazy.

157
00:06:06,285 --> 00:06:07,787
Their clips can't air.

158
00:06:07,787 --> 00:06:09,288
They have no limits.

159
00:06:09,722 --> 00:06:12,959
These two members are the ones...

160
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,895
who managed to liberate the censorship of the TV stations.

161
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:18,464
(They managed to liberate the censorship of the TV stations.)

162
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:20,299
- They played a major role. - They did indeed.

163
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:22,001
- They were the stepping stones. - They are experts.

164
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:25,338
For them, these major TV stations are just platforms.

165
00:06:25,972 --> 00:06:27,607
- They are their playgrounds. - Exactly.

166
00:06:27,774 --> 00:06:30,276
- Major TV stations don't mean much. - They act first and think later.

167
00:06:30,276 --> 00:06:32,011
"Censoring the show is up to you."

168
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:33,346
That's their motto.

169
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:34,347
Seriously.

170
00:06:34,347 --> 00:06:35,715
- Ji Hyo, you can start. - Me?

171
00:06:35,715 --> 00:06:36,983
(Ji Hyo gets to ask first.)

172
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:37,984
Watch them.

173
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:41,287
Name three moments when you find Kwang Soo lovely.

174
00:06:42,288 --> 00:06:46,392
When he smiles, buys me meals, and plays games.

175
00:06:46,392 --> 00:06:49,395
(Do you mean that, So Min?)

176
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:55,735
(You are so lovely when you smile, eat your meals, and play games.)

177
00:06:55,735 --> 00:06:57,336
She says you are lovely when you smile.

178
00:06:57,336 --> 00:06:59,639
Show her a smile. Smile to her.

179
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,407
Are you two going out?

180
00:07:01,407 --> 00:07:03,209
(What is going on?)

181
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:04,477
You should hurry up and tell us.

182
00:07:04,477 --> 00:07:05,545
Hey.

183
00:07:05,645 --> 00:07:09,215
Why would you go out with him when you held my hand?

184
00:07:09,215 --> 00:07:10,416
Seok Jin.

185
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,852
(Optical illusion made it seem like they were holding hands,)

186
00:07:12,852 --> 00:07:15,021
(but both hands were actually Seok Jin's.)

187
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:16,889
- You held my hand. - My mom scolded me.

188
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:18,791
- Why? - She thought we held hands.

189
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,227
(Don't do that.)

190
00:07:21,227 --> 00:07:23,396
People really think we held hands.

191
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:25,732
- Both hands were mine. - It's easy to misunderstand.

192
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:26,966
There was even an article...

193
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:29,035
that said we held hands.

194
00:07:29,102 --> 00:07:30,837
It's a trick of the eye.

195
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:33,840
- All right. So Min. - Okay.

196
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,709
Name three parts you like from Jae Seok's body.

197
00:07:37,143 --> 00:07:38,144
Eyes, nose, and mouth.

198
00:07:38,144 --> 00:07:40,046
(Eyes, nose, and mouth.)

199
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:41,280
Body!

200
00:07:42,148 --> 00:07:43,983
I said body.

201
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:45,218
- Come on. - Face...

202
00:07:45,218 --> 00:07:47,086
- is a part of the body. - Of course, it is.

203
00:07:47,086 --> 00:07:48,354
I can't believe you.

204
00:07:48,454 --> 00:07:49,589
- What were you thinking? - Seriously.

205
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:51,023
What were you thinking?

206
00:07:51,357 --> 00:07:53,459
- Which words do you want to hear? - What were you thinking?

207
00:07:53,593 --> 00:07:55,795
She makes the game dirty.

208
00:07:56,028 --> 00:07:57,897
I don't know what's inside her head.

209
00:07:58,231 --> 00:08:01,167
I wanted to ask a question Ji Hyo wouldn't be able to answer.

210
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:02,401
I would answer such questions easily, So Min.

211
00:08:02,535 --> 00:08:04,103
- She would. - I would.

212
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:06,839
Han Na and Su Jin are astonished.

213
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,642
- They are astonished. - They haven't even started.

214
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:11,544
(Ji Hyo wins the game.)

215
00:08:11,544 --> 00:08:13,279
(Ji Hyo joins Team Han Na, and So Min joins Team Su Jin.)

216
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:16,849
I will now announce the male members the team leaders want.

217
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,585
- The team leaders want. - This is the important part.

218
00:08:19,652 --> 00:08:22,288
- Who picked me? - I hope both of them picked me.

219
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:25,158
The names Su Jin wrote down are...

220
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,227
It would be embarrassing if neither one of them wants you.

221
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:30,296
- That's right. - That's the worst past.

222
00:08:30,396 --> 00:08:31,597
It would make you feel uncomfortable.

223
00:08:31,597 --> 00:08:34,300
(Which male member will have the honor of getting chosen first?)

224
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,902
Jae Seok.

225
00:08:35,902 --> 00:08:39,605
(Jae Seok)

226
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,141
- Why did you do that? - Be quiet.

227
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,843
- Let's see the other names. - You never know.

228
00:08:43,843 --> 00:08:45,344
- You never know. - Kwang Soo.

229
00:08:45,344 --> 00:08:46,445
Okay!

230
00:08:46,445 --> 00:08:47,847
(Kwang Soo)

231
00:08:47,847 --> 00:08:49,348
Why did you do that?

232
00:08:49,348 --> 00:08:50,483
Hold on.

233
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,351
It's Team Australia again.

234
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:53,553
- This team is... - No.

235
00:08:53,553 --> 00:08:55,054
- the worst. - The last one is...

236
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:56,689
Se Chan.

237
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:58,057
- Se Chan. - You know my name.

238
00:08:58,224 --> 00:09:00,459
- My goodness. - How did this happen?

239
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:02,228
- Se Chan. - This is nice.

240
00:09:02,228 --> 00:09:04,430
- It's okay. - I want to join Han Na.

241
00:09:04,463 --> 00:09:06,232
I am Han Na's former partner.

242
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:09,702
The names Han Na wrote down are...

243
00:09:09,969 --> 00:09:11,003
Han Na.

244
00:09:11,003 --> 00:09:12,471
(Who are Han Na's 3 candidates?)

245
00:09:12,471 --> 00:09:13,706
Jae Seok.

246
00:09:13,706 --> 00:09:15,842
(Han Na also chooses Jae Seok.)

247
00:09:15,842 --> 00:09:18,110
- Did she choose him as well? - For goodness' sake.

248
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:19,879
Gosh, I can't stand the sight of him.

249
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,682
He went to Han Na's side right away.

250
00:09:22,682 --> 00:09:23,983
She called me.

251
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,718
He left us right away.

252
00:09:25,718 --> 00:09:27,119
- Kwang Soo. - Yes!

253
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:29,222
(I am going too.)

254
00:09:29,222 --> 00:09:30,823
- He is popular. - What is going on?

255
00:09:30,823 --> 00:09:32,859
Are they top 1 and 2?

256
00:09:33,993 --> 00:09:35,962
They picked the ones who'd bring up the mood.

257
00:09:35,962 --> 00:09:37,496
- We are the minions. - Here is the last one.

258
00:09:37,496 --> 00:09:41,334
(Seok Jin, Haha, and Jong Kook have yet to be chosen.)

259
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:44,971
(Is there Han Na's last candidate among them?)

260
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:46,172
Here is the last one.

261
00:09:46,873 --> 00:09:47,974
Seok Jin.

262
00:09:48,341 --> 00:09:50,443
- Seok Jin. - Yes!

263
00:09:50,443 --> 00:09:51,477
Han Na!

264
00:09:52,712 --> 00:09:53,713
(My former partner is the best.)

265
00:09:53,713 --> 00:09:54,847
My goodness.

266
00:09:54,847 --> 00:09:56,849
(For goodness' sake.)

267
00:09:56,849 --> 00:09:58,584
(I can't believe this.)

268
00:09:58,584 --> 00:09:59,619
Han Na, you are the best.

269
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:01,587
Do they find us burdensome?

270
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:02,989
Do they find us burdensome?

271
00:10:03,222 --> 00:10:04,924
Don't you like H.O.T?

272
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:06,959
(We are dressed like H.O.T today.)

273
00:10:07,827 --> 00:10:08,995
(We like them, but...)

274
00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:10,229
- I like H.O.T. - Please take a step back.

275
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,764
Kwang Soo.

276
00:10:11,764 --> 00:10:12,965
They don't know about Anyang Hothead.

277
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:15,835
I am about to become Anyang Hothead.

278
00:10:16,102 --> 00:10:18,237
I am about to become Anyang Hothead.

279
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:19,972
He gets the nickname...

280
00:10:20,072 --> 00:10:22,174
because he is a hothead who lives in Anyang.

281
00:10:22,174 --> 00:10:23,709
I am about to become Anyang Hothead.

282
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:25,511
Even if I become a team member,

283
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:27,079
I will feel uncomfortable.

284
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,348
The Kim brothers.

285
00:10:29,448 --> 00:10:31,751
The members who were only chosen for one team are set.

286
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:35,454
For Jae Seok and Kwang Soo, who were chosen for both teams,

287
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:36,989
Su Jin and Han Na will play...

288
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:38,925
the Song Ji Hyo Game.

289
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:41,594
Play the game with ease. You don't have to feel pressured.

290
00:10:41,594 --> 00:10:42,762
(Han Na versus Su Jin)

291
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:45,331
Han Na attacks first.

292
00:10:45,364 --> 00:10:47,099
Su Jin would ask hard questions.

293
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:48,334
Ask a question.

294
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:49,502
Su Jin,

295
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:51,771
name three people here you don't like.

296
00:10:52,071 --> 00:10:53,739
Se Chan, Jae Seok, and Kwang Soo.

297
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:56,342
(Se Chan, Jae Seok, and Kwang Soo.)

298
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:57,977
Why would you say that when you chose me?

299
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,713
Why didn't you say our names? You should have mentioned us.

300
00:11:00,947 --> 00:11:04,216
- Why didn't you say our names? - We are behind you.

301
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:07,486
- We are here. - We are two people you don't like.

302
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:10,756
They are like the grim reapers.

303
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,325
Stop it. It's scary.

304
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:13,759
Don't think about collecting her soul.

305
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,594
- She first said she didn't like us. - Beware of Anyang Hothead.

306
00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:16,729
- Why didn't you say our names? - I can't hear them.

307
00:11:17,229 --> 00:11:18,764
They will be ferocious today.

308
00:11:18,764 --> 00:11:19,966
(You will regret not choosing us.)

309
00:11:20,132 --> 00:11:21,600
- Is it my turn to ask a question? - Yes, Su Jin.

310
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,102
(Su Jin asks a question this time.)

311
00:11:23,102 --> 00:11:24,570
Name your favorite games.

312
00:11:25,504 --> 00:11:28,441
Baskin-Robbins 31, Game of Wits, and King Game.

313
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:30,710
(Baskin-Robbins 31, Game of Wits, and King Game.)

314
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,812
- King Game? - King Game?

315
00:11:33,512 --> 00:11:34,714
- My goodness. - It's not like that.

316
00:11:34,714 --> 00:11:36,716
- I just remembered it. - She likes to order people around.

317
00:11:36,716 --> 00:11:37,817
Did you play the game...

318
00:11:37,817 --> 00:11:38,851
- by writing numbers on cigarettes? - No, no.

319
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:40,086
Stop it!

320
00:11:40,086 --> 00:11:41,921
(I know how King Game is played.)

321
00:11:42,021 --> 00:11:43,823
- What did she say? - For goodness' sake.

322
00:11:43,823 --> 00:11:45,958
- I just remembered it. - My goodness.

323
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:48,761
I haven't heard of King Game in a long time.

324
00:11:48,761 --> 00:11:50,096
King Game is the legend.

325
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:51,230
King Game.

326
00:11:51,597 --> 00:11:52,698
So Min.

327
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:54,233
Han Na.

328
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:58,738
Name your three favorite poets.

329
00:11:58,738 --> 00:11:59,839
- Poets. - Name three.

330
00:12:00,106 --> 00:12:02,975
(Her lips tremble.)

331
00:12:02,975 --> 00:12:06,178
(My goodness.)

332
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:09,015
You should have named anyone.

333
00:12:09,181 --> 00:12:10,316
Su Jin did this.

334
00:12:10,316 --> 00:12:13,219
(Despite of moving her lips, she fails to answer.)

335
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:14,487
That was a good question.

336
00:12:14,487 --> 00:12:16,489
The first round came to an end.

337
00:12:16,489 --> 00:12:19,492
Han Na, choose between Jae Seok and Kwang Soo.

338
00:12:19,558 --> 00:12:21,827
Su Jin, choose between Jong Kook and Haha.

339
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:23,095
Then we will have the second round.

340
00:12:23,596 --> 00:12:24,964
- That's a good idea. - Do I say the name out loud?

341
00:12:24,964 --> 00:12:26,098
Yes.

342
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:28,634
- Me? - At least act like you are torn.

343
00:12:28,634 --> 00:12:31,103
(At least act like you are torn.)

344
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,239
- I will join Team Han Na. - I will win the next round.

345
00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:34,974
Now, Su Jin will choose...

346
00:12:34,974 --> 00:12:37,176
between Jong Kook and Haha.

347
00:12:37,176 --> 00:12:39,211
- Okay. - I want Haha.

348
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:40,813
(She doesn't hesitate.)

349
00:12:40,813 --> 00:12:41,881
My goodness.

350
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:43,716
(Welcome, Haha.)

351
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:44,750
Why doesn't she want me?

352
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,085
- It looks like... - Why doesn't she want me?

353
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:47,753
- she hates hotheads. - I don't understand.

354
00:12:47,753 --> 00:12:49,021
Is that what it is?

355
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:50,322
(Jong Kook doesn't get chosen for the first time.)

356
00:12:50,322 --> 00:12:52,058
- Does she hate hotheads? - She hates hotheads.

357
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,726
- Does she hate hotheads? - Su Jin.

358
00:12:53,726 --> 00:12:55,327
You should have given it some thought.

359
00:12:56,228 --> 00:12:57,329
All right.

360
00:12:57,496 --> 00:12:58,864
It's Han Na's turn.

361
00:12:59,331 --> 00:13:02,735
Name three inferiority complexes about your personality.

362
00:13:03,636 --> 00:13:04,837
Well, I am easygoing.

363
00:13:04,837 --> 00:13:08,007
(She smacks her lips.)

364
00:13:09,308 --> 00:13:12,845
(Despite of smacking her lips, she fails to answer again.)

365
00:13:12,845 --> 00:13:14,980
This is a terrible game.

366
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,349
Su Jin is angry. She is angry.

367
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:20,486
Pulmuone! Pulmuone! Edit this part out.

368
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:22,488
Su Jin yelled out a brand name...

369
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:24,323
to edit this part out.

370
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:25,558
Edit this part out.

371
00:13:25,858 --> 00:13:27,059
My goodness.

372
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:28,461
I learned it from watching TV.

373
00:13:28,461 --> 00:13:31,063
We can bleep out the brand name.

374
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,065
- It's not a problem. - She is really competitive.

375
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:36,469
Kwang Soo joins Team Han Na,

376
00:13:36,469 --> 00:13:38,604
and Jong Kook joins Team Su Jin.

377
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:40,739
- Am I joining her team? - Yes.

378
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:42,374
(He is angry.)

379
00:13:42,374 --> 00:13:43,609
(For goodness' sake.)

380
00:13:43,943 --> 00:13:45,978
I think Su Jin lost her pace.

381
00:13:45,978 --> 00:13:47,713
Anyang Hothead is being a bit...

382
00:13:47,813 --> 00:13:50,249
- I will act as a middleman. - Anyang Hothead.

383
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:52,618
I will be the X-Man of this team.

384
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:55,020
We are with the grim reapers. This is bad.

385
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,088
We're all dressed in dark colors.

386
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:57,256
(Team Red and Team White)

387
00:13:57,623 --> 00:14:01,093
(The first team mission unfolds at a very special place.)

388
00:14:01,093 --> 00:14:02,995
(It's the outpost of the heroes who protect the Earth.)

389
00:14:02,995 --> 00:14:04,497
This place suits me.

390
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:06,432
Black Panther.

391
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:09,335
(Amidst the true heroes who make the world go wild...)

392
00:14:11,337 --> 00:14:14,974
(are Grasshopper, who shows an unimpressive jump...)

393
00:14:14,974 --> 00:14:16,475
It's a workout.

394
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:18,677
(and Haroro, the kindergartners' hero.)

395
00:14:18,677 --> 00:14:21,714
(What is the first team mission?)

396
00:14:22,348 --> 00:14:23,849
There are suitcases.

397
00:14:24,884 --> 00:14:26,752
They must be important.

398
00:14:26,852 --> 00:14:28,087
Our names are written on them.

399
00:14:28,087 --> 00:14:29,955
- Really? - Don't touch them.

400
00:14:29,955 --> 00:14:31,056
Don't touch them.

401
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:34,360
- It's your favorite race, So Min. - What is it?

402
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,061
The prize is money.

403
00:14:36,095 --> 00:14:37,630
- Really? - The prize is money.

404
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,064
They donate the money anyway.

405
00:14:39,064 --> 00:14:40,966
(They donate the money anyway.)

406
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,235
- If you win, they go, - I have never won.

407
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:45,838
"We will donate the money under So Min's name."

408
00:14:45,938 --> 00:14:47,439
I still want to win.

409
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:49,708
It will feel nice to donate money under my name.

410
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,210
I have never won.

411
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,512
You don't have a winner's face.

412
00:14:53,512 --> 00:14:54,747
(He takes a physiognomic approach.)

413
00:14:54,747 --> 00:14:56,015
I will help you win.

414
00:14:56,982 --> 00:14:58,951
Jong Kook, teach him a lesson.

415
00:14:58,951 --> 00:15:00,719
- Jong Kook, teach him a lesson. - My goodness.

416
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:02,188
- You jerk. - Teach him a lesson.

417
00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:04,323
Do you think he'll listen?

418
00:15:04,557 --> 00:15:05,958
What are you doing?

419
00:15:06,859 --> 00:15:08,460
How is it different from hitting me yourself?

420
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,462
(She doesn't know how to use the hero.)

421
00:15:10,963 --> 00:15:13,065
Today, you will have...

422
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:15,734
an intense mind game to win the prize money...

423
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:17,970
in Same Money, Different Dreams Race.

424
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,005
- You see the suitcases, right? - Yes.

425
00:15:20,105 --> 00:15:24,877
Each suitcase contains 100 dollars.

426
00:15:24,977 --> 00:15:26,679
- 100 dollars? - Yes.

427
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:30,516
I will buy the same stocks that Seok Jin has with 100 dollars.

428
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,618
Why would you throw away 100 dollars?

429
00:15:32,618 --> 00:15:33,719
It will be difficult to buy them.

430
00:15:34,353 --> 00:15:35,354
Okay.

431
00:15:35,454 --> 00:15:36,755
After each round,

432
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:39,692
you can turn in a portion of your money...

433
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:41,927
to Running Bank...

434
00:15:42,094 --> 00:15:43,128
in the tens.

435
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:45,064
The total sum will be calculated for each team.

436
00:15:45,064 --> 00:15:46,932
The team with the higher amount will win.

437
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:49,468
There are three rounds in total. After the final race,

438
00:15:49,735 --> 00:15:52,871
the member of the winning team with the highest amount wins.

439
00:15:53,172 --> 00:16:00,846
The winner will get tenfold of what's left in the suitcase...

440
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,082
and the right to choose the four members for penalty.

441
00:16:03,482 --> 00:16:05,751
If you leave behind 100 dollars, you will get 1,000 dollars.

442
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:09,555
You can turn in a portion of your money...

443
00:16:09,555 --> 00:16:11,890
to Running Bank.

444
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,859
The team with the higher amount wins.

445
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:17,263
The member of the winning team with the highest amount wins.

446
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:19,131
For the team, submit a big sum.

447
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:21,433
- For yourself, submit a small sum. - For the team...

448
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:23,836
- For the team, you must sacrifice. - Right.

449
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:25,371
What's good about your team winning?

450
00:16:25,871 --> 00:16:28,841
Only one member of the winning team will receive the penalty.

451
00:16:28,974 --> 00:16:31,010
- I see. - There is the water bomb.

452
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,112
Three members of the losing team will receive the penalty.

453
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:34,680
You need to work for the team.

454
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,182
(You need to work for the team.)

455
00:16:37,182 --> 00:16:38,951
- Don't be ridiculous. - Don't be ridiculous.

456
00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:40,619
Your facial expression says otherwise.

457
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:41,987
You need to work for the team.

458
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:45,224
There is a big mountain we need to overcome...

459
00:16:45,224 --> 00:16:46,692
in our team.

460
00:16:46,825 --> 00:16:47,926
(She is Mount Everest when it comes to betrayal.)

461
00:16:47,926 --> 00:16:49,828
- So Min is a big mountain. - That's not true.

462
00:16:49,828 --> 00:16:52,131
- We are a team. Nevis! - Swing.

463
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:54,199
- You were not on our team. Go away. - Nevis!

464
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:56,468
- Swing. - You were not on our team. Go away.

465
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:58,671
- You went to see crocodiles. - We should deposit money.

466
00:16:58,671 --> 00:17:02,374
Before depositing money, you'll carry out a mission.

467
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:06,345
I'll tell the winners how much a member of the other team deposited.

468
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:07,713
That's nice.

469
00:17:08,447 --> 00:17:11,984
You'll play Don't Stop Relay and compete for Chance Cards.

470
00:17:11,984 --> 00:17:14,720
It'll be a team relay and has four stages.

471
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,388
The team that finishes the race first wins.

472
00:17:16,488 --> 00:17:19,091
The first part is rock climbing.

473
00:17:19,725 --> 00:17:21,760
- The wall is on your left side. - Look at that.

474
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,795
Rock climbing.

475
00:17:22,795 --> 00:17:25,197
For the second part, there's a laser maze behind you.

476
00:17:25,531 --> 00:17:26,565
Is it that one?

477
00:17:26,565 --> 00:17:28,801
One member of each team has to go through the laser maze.

478
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:30,736
They'll pull out the flag at the finish line...

479
00:17:30,736 --> 00:17:32,671
and take it to the next stage.

480
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:36,575
The third part is couple jump rope.

481
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:39,511
Depending on how many times you touch the laser beams in the maze,

482
00:17:39,511 --> 00:17:42,681
your team members' jump rope goal will be determined.

483
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:45,184
The fourth part is Ttakji Othello.

484
00:17:45,184 --> 00:17:46,485
Within a minute,

485
00:17:46,485 --> 00:17:49,321
you have to make sure more ttakjis have your team color.

486
00:17:50,155 --> 00:17:52,157
(Rock climbing, laser maze,)

487
00:17:52,157 --> 00:17:54,426
(couple jump rope, Ttakji Othello)

488
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,994
I'll win.

489
00:17:55,994 --> 00:17:57,262
(Kwang Soo and Se Chan get ready for rock climbing.)

490
00:17:57,262 --> 00:17:58,364
I'll win by all means.

491
00:17:58,464 --> 00:17:59,665
I'll show you guys.

492
00:18:00,566 --> 00:18:01,734
- Okay. - They're changing positions.

493
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:02,968
- What? - They are.

494
00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:04,636
- What? - What did he say?

495
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:06,805
- They're changing positions. - They are.

496
00:18:06,805 --> 00:18:08,140
(What?)

497
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,377
- What did he say? - Say something.

498
00:18:11,377 --> 00:18:12,611
Say, "Good luck," at least.

499
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,049
- All right. - What?

500
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,851
- Go away. - What did you say?

501
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:20,252
You didn't say anything. What's wrong?

502
00:18:20,452 --> 00:18:21,620
- I can do it! - Hey.

503
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,788
(Su Jin learns a strange behavior.)

504
00:18:23,255 --> 00:18:24,923
Why did you blow in my ear?

505
00:18:25,157 --> 00:18:27,459
- She blew air into my ear. - She likes you.

506
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:28,727
Where is Han Na?

507
00:18:28,794 --> 00:18:30,629
She's in position.

508
00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:32,698
- Se Chan, good luck! - Thank you.

509
00:18:32,698 --> 00:18:33,899
- Good luck! - Good luck!

510
00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:35,134
Han Na, wish me luck.

511
00:18:35,134 --> 00:18:36,635
Why is Han Na's shirt tucked in?

512
00:18:36,635 --> 00:18:38,070
- So it doesn't touch the beams. - Laser beams.

513
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,240
Han Na, I love your attitude.

514
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,408
She's amazing.

515
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,809
Han Na is the best.

516
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:45,043
So Min, do the same.

517
00:18:45,711 --> 00:18:47,679
- So Min, don't copy her. - Gosh, So Min.

518
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,114
That's not how you do it.

519
00:18:49,114 --> 00:18:50,416
(Uncomfortable)

520
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,551
- They are hitched up too high. - Gosh, So Min.

521
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:54,119
(So Min is overzealous.)

522
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,722
I'll win by all means.

523
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:58,657
(They give up on their style.)

524
00:18:58,657 --> 00:19:00,526
- Let's start. - Okay.

525
00:19:00,526 --> 00:19:02,361
- Se Chan, go for it! - Let's do this!

526
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:04,229
- Gosh. - Let's start.

527
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,231
Ready.

528
00:19:06,231 --> 00:19:07,933
Go for it!

529
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:09,668
- Ready. - Gosh, I feel burdened.

530
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:12,271
- Kwang Soo, you can do this! - Kwang Soo!

531
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:13,439
- You can do this! - Kwang Soo!

532
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:14,473
- They've started. - Stay calm.

533
00:19:14,473 --> 00:19:16,909
- Use your legs. - You're doing great!

534
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:18,010
- They've started. - Stay calm.

535
00:19:18,043 --> 00:19:20,212
- Use your legs. - You're doing great!

536
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:22,581
- They've started. - Stay calm.

537
00:19:22,781 --> 00:19:25,250
Se Chan, keep going up.

538
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,419
- Se Chan, go. - You're doing great!

539
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:28,554
- Use your legs. - Se Chan.

540
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:29,621
Se Chan, you can do this!

541
00:19:29,621 --> 00:19:30,989
Kwang Soo.

542
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:32,391
I have nothing to step on.

543
00:19:32,391 --> 00:19:33,659
Kwang Soo, go up!

544
00:19:33,659 --> 00:19:34,993
- Use your legs. - Your left foot.

545
00:19:34,993 --> 00:19:36,628
- Push your body up. - Se Chan.

546
00:19:36,628 --> 00:19:38,230
- Keep going up. - Way to go!

547
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,431
Keep going!

548
00:19:39,431 --> 00:19:41,400
- Your left foot! - Your legs...

549
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,735
- Your left foot! - Use your legs.

550
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:46,004
- You're doing great! - Your left foot!

551
00:19:46,004 --> 00:19:47,439
Use your legs.

552
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:49,575
(Se Chan falls.)

553
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:51,643
(What?)

554
00:19:52,811 --> 00:19:55,781
(Kwang Soo takes advantage of his height and succeeds.)

555
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:57,382
Way to go!

556
00:19:57,382 --> 00:19:58,717
Don't go this way.

557
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:00,285
- It's over there. - It's not that way.

558
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:01,720
- It's over there. - Over here!

559
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,522
- Over there! - It's not that way.

560
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:05,791
(He's supposed to go in the other direction.)

561
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,759
- It's over there. - Over here!

562
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:09,528
- It's over there. - What happened?

563
00:20:10,162 --> 00:20:12,064
- Go that way. - Over here.

564
00:20:12,397 --> 00:20:13,799
- Kwang Soo. - Over here.

565
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,734
- We'll win! - Here.

566
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:17,236
- Over here. - Kwang Soo!

567
00:20:17,236 --> 00:20:18,971
(So Min intercepts him.)

568
00:20:18,971 --> 00:20:20,939
Come here.

569
00:20:20,939 --> 00:20:23,008
- Put the flag in. - Se Chan, hurry!

570
00:20:23,075 --> 00:20:24,476
Se Chan, hurry.

571
00:20:24,543 --> 00:20:25,744
- Put it in. - Se Chan!

572
00:20:25,744 --> 00:20:27,479
Hurry, Se Chan!

573
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,081
Se Chan!

574
00:20:29,081 --> 00:20:30,716
- Kwang Soo! - Se Chan!

575
00:20:30,983 --> 00:20:32,251
Can I put it in?

576
00:20:32,384 --> 00:20:34,620
Se Chan!

577
00:20:34,953 --> 00:20:36,021
It's in.

578
00:20:36,021 --> 00:20:37,189
(Han Na enters the laser maze.)

579
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:40,659
Go for it, Han Na!

580
00:20:41,426 --> 00:20:43,228
(The laser beams are on.)

581
00:20:44,963 --> 00:20:46,632
(Flexible)

582
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:50,502
(She goes through the beams smoothly as in a movie.)

583
00:20:51,203 --> 00:20:54,740
(Still, she's losing points, and the jump rope goal goes up.)

584
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:55,941
(Focused)

585
00:20:56,675 --> 00:20:58,277
Are you going to play some background music?

586
00:20:58,277 --> 00:21:00,879
(Singing)

587
00:21:00,879 --> 00:21:03,248
(Han Na is shooting a spy movie.)

588
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:06,418
(Meanwhile, a wrestling movie is being shot over here.)

589
00:21:06,418 --> 00:21:08,020
That's a cobra twist.

590
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,489
- That's a cobra twist. - Gosh.

591
00:21:10,489 --> 00:21:12,925
(So Min is punished for cheating.)

592
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:16,728
Hold on. Hey!

593
00:21:17,195 --> 00:21:18,463
Stop it!

594
00:21:18,697 --> 00:21:19,932
Gosh!

595
00:21:22,434 --> 00:21:24,937
Se Chan, what are you doing?

596
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,471
- Why are you not coming? - Han Na, go!

597
00:21:26,705 --> 00:21:27,739
Hold on.

598
00:21:28,473 --> 00:21:30,709
I got it. Where do I go?

599
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:32,711
(Se Chan finally finishes the first part.)

600
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:35,614
- Go! - Run!

601
00:21:35,781 --> 00:21:39,618
(Laser maze score, couple jump rope goal)

602
00:21:39,618 --> 00:21:41,119
(Alarm)

603
00:21:41,687 --> 00:21:43,655
(After touching the laser beams a few times,)

604
00:21:43,655 --> 00:21:46,224
(Han Na wins 4,050 points.)

605
00:21:46,725 --> 00:21:48,727
- Did she win 4,050 points? - I'm done.

606
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:51,196
- Over here. - Han Na, put the flag in here.

607
00:21:51,196 --> 00:21:52,197
(Team Red is ahead.)

608
00:21:52,197 --> 00:21:53,465
- Jump rope 10 times. - 10 times.

609
00:21:53,465 --> 00:21:55,100
- Let's do this. - Let's go.

610
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,234
- Start. - Start.

611
00:21:56,401 --> 00:21:57,402
- Run! Hold on. - One.

612
00:21:57,402 --> 00:21:58,770
- Hey! - Run!

613
00:22:00,272 --> 00:22:02,174
(Excuse us.)

614
00:22:03,642 --> 00:22:04,943
What are you doing?

615
00:22:05,477 --> 00:22:06,878
What are you doing now?

616
00:22:07,813 --> 00:22:09,748
What is this? What do I do?

617
00:22:10,382 --> 00:22:11,383
How do I go?

618
00:22:11,383 --> 00:22:12,451
(Striding)

619
00:22:12,451 --> 00:22:14,653
What do I do?

620
00:22:16,555 --> 00:22:17,723
Oh, my.

621
00:22:17,723 --> 00:22:20,325
- 3, 4, 5, 6... - 3, 4, 5, 6...

622
00:22:20,726 --> 00:22:22,694
(Team Red is struggling with the jump rope.)

623
00:22:23,862 --> 00:22:25,564
(So Min wins 4,450 points.)

624
00:22:25,564 --> 00:22:26,565
I'm out.

625
00:22:27,165 --> 00:22:28,600
So Min is out.

626
00:22:28,734 --> 00:22:33,071
- Hurry. - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

627
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:35,674
- 7, 8, 9, 10. - 7, 8, 9, 10.

628
00:22:35,674 --> 00:22:36,808
- Done. - Done.

629
00:22:36,808 --> 00:22:38,076
- The flag! - The flag!

630
00:22:38,076 --> 00:22:39,444
- Ji Hyo. - We did it.

631
00:22:39,544 --> 00:22:40,746
- Over there. - Ji Hyo.

632
00:22:41,246 --> 00:22:42,514
(They have to make sure more ttakjis are red.)

633
00:22:42,514 --> 00:22:43,649
- Start. - What's our color?

634
00:22:43,715 --> 00:22:44,750
The flag is in.

635
00:22:44,983 --> 00:22:46,918
- Start. - What's our color?

636
00:22:47,486 --> 00:22:49,388
- Start. - What's our color?

637
00:22:49,454 --> 00:22:51,423
(What?)

638
00:22:51,423 --> 00:22:53,659
(He changed red to white.)

639
00:22:54,226 --> 00:22:56,928
(Everyone hurries him, and Seok Jin starts without thinking.)

640
00:22:56,928 --> 00:22:58,563
Aren't we supposed to change white to red?

641
00:22:59,164 --> 00:23:00,465
(We're Team Red.)

642
00:23:00,465 --> 00:23:02,000
- Change white to red. - Oh, red.

643
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,402
Gosh.

644
00:23:03,402 --> 00:23:04,736
Change white to red.

645
00:23:04,736 --> 00:23:06,972
- Change white to red. - Red.

646
00:23:07,305 --> 00:23:08,540
Come on.

647
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,708
- Good. - Okay.

648
00:23:10,008 --> 00:23:11,076
Here.

649
00:23:11,376 --> 00:23:13,445
It's too short. Is it okay?

650
00:23:13,979 --> 00:23:16,481
(Will Jong Kook do his best for his team?)

651
00:23:17,516 --> 00:23:22,521
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

652
00:23:22,521 --> 00:23:23,755
Take the flag!

653
00:23:23,755 --> 00:23:25,123
- Let's go. - Let's go.

654
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,291
Okay!

655
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,459
Let's hurry.

656
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:28,560
- Haha! - Hurry.

657
00:23:28,894 --> 00:23:30,462
- Start. - Stay calm.

658
00:23:30,662 --> 00:23:31,830
1, 2,

659
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,198
- 3... - We might lose.

660
00:23:33,198 --> 00:23:35,367
You don't have to use so much force.

661
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:36,501
Way to go!

662
00:23:36,501 --> 00:23:39,071
- Seok Jin! - What is he doing?

663
00:23:39,771 --> 00:23:41,139
(What?)

664
00:23:41,139 --> 00:23:43,075
(There are more white ttakjis.)

665
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,110
- Seok Jin! - What is he doing?

666
00:23:45,243 --> 00:23:47,145
(He's mostly groaning.)

667
00:23:47,713 --> 00:23:50,215
- Gosh, I can't believe him. - Seok Jin!

668
00:23:50,449 --> 00:23:52,050
You don't have to use so much force.

669
00:23:52,484 --> 00:23:54,786
(He aims for a white one,)

670
00:23:54,786 --> 00:23:59,091
(but a red one flips.)

671
00:23:59,124 --> 00:24:00,892
- Gosh, that man... - Seok Jin!

672
00:24:01,426 --> 00:24:05,063
(He keeps flipping the same one over and over.)

673
00:24:05,063 --> 00:24:06,565
No!

674
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:08,500
- We might win! - 10 seconds left.

675
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:09,735
Gosh.

676
00:24:09,868 --> 00:24:10,969
I can't believe it.

677
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:12,504
What's with him?

678
00:24:13,438 --> 00:24:15,173
(When he's supposed to flip ttakjis,)

679
00:24:15,173 --> 00:24:17,242
(he's making his team members flip out.)

680
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:18,510
Seok Jin!

681
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,711
We're going to win.

682
00:24:19,711 --> 00:24:21,413
(It's too heartbreaking to watch.)

683
00:24:22,714 --> 00:24:24,683
- What is this? - What happened?

684
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,652
(Most of the ttakjis are white.)

685
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,422
- We won! - We did it.

686
00:24:30,422 --> 00:24:32,290
- I mean... - Gosh.

687
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,894
- We caught up with them. - I couldn't be a hothead.

688
00:24:35,894 --> 00:24:36,895
It's unfair.

689
00:24:36,895 --> 00:24:38,230
It's unfair. I can't believe it.

690
00:24:39,564 --> 00:24:40,632
This is impossible.

691
00:24:41,133 --> 00:24:43,401
You don't have to use much force.

692
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:45,504
You can flip it like this.

693
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:48,206
- It's so easy. - Han Na, why did you choose him?

694
00:24:48,206 --> 00:24:50,208
Jae Seok should have played the ttakji game.

695
00:24:50,242 --> 00:24:51,676
- Okay. We won. - We won.

696
00:24:51,676 --> 00:24:52,978
Let's move.

697
00:24:52,978 --> 00:24:54,880
- All right. - How many rounds are there?

698
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,216
Gosh, we lost because of Seok Jin.

699
00:24:58,216 --> 00:24:59,351
(The team with more money in the bank wins.)

700
00:24:59,351 --> 00:25:00,719
- We won. - The bank is here.

701
00:25:00,952 --> 00:25:03,054
- The bank is here. - It's the bank!

702
00:25:03,054 --> 00:25:04,823
Let's go to the bank!

703
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,259
- Each team should gather together. - Okay.

704
00:25:07,325 --> 00:25:09,928
Since Han Na's team lost,

705
00:25:10,028 --> 00:25:14,266
you'll deposit money 1 by 1.

706
00:25:14,266 --> 00:25:15,734
Seok Jin, you should go first.

707
00:25:15,734 --> 00:25:17,502
- Can't I go later? - Go first.

708
00:25:18,436 --> 00:25:20,472
Team Su Jin, come here.

709
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:23,575
Let's see how much Jae Seok deposits.

710
00:25:23,575 --> 00:25:25,510
- Of course. - Or...

711
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,012
Kwang Soo.

712
00:25:27,012 --> 00:25:28,280
We don't have to see his.

713
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,115
We need to see Jae Seok's...

714
00:25:30,115 --> 00:25:32,050
for us to destroy that team.

715
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,019
- Then I'll deposit a lot. - What?

716
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:35,020
(Team Leader's attitude)

717
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,222
To win, we have to deposit more money...

718
00:25:37,222 --> 00:25:39,724
as a team. It's been just a game so far.

719
00:25:39,724 --> 00:25:40,725
Okay.

720
00:25:40,725 --> 00:25:42,627
- Am I right? - Han Na, you're so...

721
00:25:42,627 --> 00:25:43,962
- You're so nice. - I don't want water bombs.

722
00:25:43,962 --> 00:25:46,731
- If I were Seok Jin, - You're amazing.

723
00:25:46,731 --> 00:25:48,500
I'd say, "It's okay. I'll deposit a lot."

724
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,902
- But you said, "You're so nice." - And then he gave me a high five.

725
00:25:50,902 --> 00:25:53,205
- It's a team game. - I was trying to persuade you.

726
00:25:53,205 --> 00:25:55,373
- You should deposit 30 dollars. - I will.

727
00:25:55,373 --> 00:25:57,075
- Okay. - Then we'll deposit...

728
00:25:57,075 --> 00:26:00,412
20, 40, 50, 60...

729
00:26:00,445 --> 00:26:01,813
90 dollars in total.

730
00:26:01,813 --> 00:26:03,715
- Okay. - We have to deposit...

731
00:26:03,982 --> 00:26:06,251
How much do you plan to deposit?

732
00:26:06,251 --> 00:26:08,253
Tell me.

733
00:26:08,253 --> 00:26:09,654
I was thinking of more than 40.

734
00:26:09,654 --> 00:26:11,189
- Either this or this. - Either this or this.

735
00:26:11,189 --> 00:26:12,591
- Stop lying. - Will you?

736
00:26:12,591 --> 00:26:13,892
That's absurd.

737
00:26:13,892 --> 00:26:15,160
Just remember...

738
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,463
if any of us deposits less than 10, we might lose.

739
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,398
- I'll deposit 20. - Then we can win.

740
00:26:20,465 --> 00:26:21,700
- If we deposit that, we'll win. - We'll win.

741
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,901
- Okay. - I'll deposit 20.

742
00:26:22,901 --> 00:26:24,069
- Kwang Soo. - We'll definitely win.

743
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:26,071
Seok Jin will go first.

744
00:26:26,171 --> 00:26:28,640
Seok Jin will deposit money.

745
00:26:29,074 --> 00:26:30,508
We should keep an eye on him.

746
00:26:30,675 --> 00:26:32,310
If he doesn't deposit 30...

747
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,012
(Seok Jin promised to deposit 30 dollars.)

748
00:26:34,012 --> 00:26:35,313
- Seok Jin, this is... - Seok Jin.

749
00:26:35,313 --> 00:26:37,682
- You're starting this thing. - Keep your promise.

750
00:26:37,682 --> 00:26:39,150
If you don't...

751
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,518
We won't forgive you.

752
00:26:40,518 --> 00:26:42,320
I'll keep my promise.

753
00:26:43,955 --> 00:26:46,024
(Hold on...)

754
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:48,493
It's not obligatory, right?

755
00:26:49,628 --> 00:26:52,898
(For the team to win, you have to deposit more.)

756
00:26:53,765 --> 00:26:55,367
You'd better pay, Seok Jin.

757
00:26:55,433 --> 00:26:56,534
We won't leave you in peace.

758
00:26:56,534 --> 00:26:57,736
(Keeping money is beneficial for individuals.)

759
00:27:00,205 --> 00:27:01,439
I should deposit 10 dollars.

760
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,141
I promised 30 dollars,

761
00:27:03,675 --> 00:27:04,776
but I'll go with 10 dollars.

762
00:27:04,776 --> 00:27:06,511
(30 dollars is too much.)

763
00:27:06,978 --> 00:27:09,381
(He only pays 10 dollars.)

764
00:27:09,681 --> 00:27:10,749
I feel bad.

765
00:27:10,749 --> 00:27:12,117
(He feels bad for breaking the promise.)

766
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,019
- 30 dollars. - Who's next?

767
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,055
- I'll go. - Okay, Ji Hyo.

768
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:18,990
- You know how much to pay, right? - You know it, right?

769
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:20,325
- Yes. - Okay.

770
00:27:20,525 --> 00:27:24,162
I'll pay 20 dollars that I promised.

771
00:27:24,462 --> 00:27:25,463
Okay.

772
00:27:27,499 --> 00:27:29,100
(Even Jae Seok...)

773
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,236
(deposits 10 dollars as promised.)

774
00:27:31,236 --> 00:27:33,972
(He hopes that he can trust others.)

775
00:27:34,673 --> 00:27:37,042
(Han Na should deposit 20 dollars.)

776
00:27:39,511 --> 00:27:41,479
(Is she only paying 10 dollars?)

777
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:43,481
(At least she deposits 10 dollars.)

778
00:27:43,481 --> 00:27:44,816
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

779
00:27:45,183 --> 00:27:47,319
- Do as you promised. - I will.

780
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,488
(No one seems to trust him.)

781
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,825
How does it work? How do I deposit?

782
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,562
(How do I pretend like I paid?)

783
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,231
How do I pretend like I paid?

784
00:28:00,231 --> 00:28:01,733
- Tear it, and give it to me. - Tear it?

785
00:28:01,733 --> 00:28:02,734
Like this?

786
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:04,769
(He pretends to pay.)

787
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:07,872
(Kwang Soo is meticulous even as he betrays.)

788
00:28:07,872 --> 00:28:09,975
(Team Red pays 50 dollars in total.)

789
00:28:09,975 --> 00:28:12,310
- Our team is done. - It's over.

790
00:28:12,477 --> 00:28:16,481
The other team decides whose amount you want to know.

791
00:28:16,481 --> 00:28:18,483
- I see. - The amount...

792
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,286
won't be revealed to Team Red. Only you will find out.

793
00:28:21,286 --> 00:28:22,687
- Is it a secret to us? - Yes.

794
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:23,755
- Listen. - How about Jae Seok?

795
00:28:23,755 --> 00:28:25,323
To be honest,

796
00:28:25,323 --> 00:28:28,159
I want to know 1 of those 3.

797
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,295
Who are you talking about?

798
00:28:30,295 --> 00:28:31,496
What did he say?

799
00:28:31,496 --> 00:28:32,630
What did you say?

800
00:28:32,897 --> 00:28:34,699
Are you being satiric?

801
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,802
- I mean those three men. - Do you mean those...

802
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:39,471
- who talk? - That's right.

803
00:28:39,471 --> 00:28:41,840
- I mean those who talk. - What about them?

804
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,376
Let's find out one of their amounts...

805
00:28:44,376 --> 00:28:47,812
and react in a suspicious way.

806
00:28:47,979 --> 00:28:50,281
- It'll destroy them. - Do you mean Jae Seok?

807
00:28:50,548 --> 00:28:51,916
How about the one with a pouting mouth?

808
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:53,284
- Pouting mouth? - Shall we pick him?

809
00:28:53,284 --> 00:28:54,786
- Is it okay? - That sounds good.

810
00:28:54,786 --> 00:28:56,021
We'll find out Jae Seok's.

811
00:28:56,454 --> 00:28:57,455
I paid...

812
00:28:57,822 --> 00:28:59,290
the amount that I promised.

813
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,792
Won't you tell us?

814
00:29:01,793 --> 00:29:02,794
Let's see.

815
00:29:02,794 --> 00:29:04,362
(They check that he paid 10 dollars.)

816
00:29:04,362 --> 00:29:05,964
- Gosh. - Goodness.

817
00:29:06,031 --> 00:29:07,032
That's funny.

818
00:29:07,032 --> 00:29:09,534
- He's such a trickster. - Goodness.

819
00:29:09,534 --> 00:29:11,770
- How could you do that, Jae Seok? - Jae Seok.

820
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,738
- Didn't he pay? - How could you, Jae Seok?

821
00:29:13,738 --> 00:29:15,540
Come on, I'm telling the truth.

822
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,741
I swear.

823
00:29:16,975 --> 00:29:18,476
What if no one paid?

824
00:29:18,476 --> 00:29:21,813
- Han Na, I'm being honest. - You can't trust him.

825
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:24,449
So Min, what did it say?

826
00:29:24,449 --> 00:29:26,551
Tell us exactly what you read.

827
00:29:26,551 --> 00:29:27,652
It said zero.

828
00:29:28,686 --> 00:29:30,522
How dare you, So Min?

829
00:29:30,955 --> 00:29:32,590
Wait. Was I not supposed to say it?

830
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,825
- Can't I? - We'll keep it to us.

831
00:29:33,825 --> 00:29:35,060
I'll stay quiet.

832
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,461
So Min is lying again.

833
00:29:36,461 --> 00:29:38,229
I don't think Jae Seok paid.

834
00:29:38,763 --> 00:29:40,165
- Gosh. - I don't think he paid.

835
00:29:40,165 --> 00:29:41,633
Let's look at the total amount.

836
00:29:41,633 --> 00:29:42,801
- Right. - Yes.

837
00:29:42,801 --> 00:29:46,071
Each member from Team White will deposit now.

838
00:29:46,071 --> 00:29:47,238
- Go first, So Min. - Okay.

839
00:29:47,972 --> 00:29:50,875
I bet So Min won't pay.

840
00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:53,244
There's no point of her going.

841
00:29:53,244 --> 00:29:54,712
I bet all my money that she won't pay anything.

842
00:29:54,712 --> 00:29:55,713
She won't pay.

843
00:29:55,713 --> 00:29:57,882
I'll make many go bankrupt today.

844
00:29:57,882 --> 00:30:01,686
Kwang Soo, Jae Seok, and Ji Hyo will lose all their money.

845
00:30:01,886 --> 00:30:03,922
- Seriously. - So Min.

846
00:30:04,222 --> 00:30:06,157
- Trust me. - Just pay the minimum.

847
00:30:06,157 --> 00:30:07,692
Please trust me.

848
00:30:07,692 --> 00:30:09,260
Pay what we agreed on.

849
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,963
- Pay the minimum. - I don't think So Min will pay.

850
00:30:11,963 --> 00:30:13,531
- Hurry up. - I trust you.

851
00:30:13,531 --> 00:30:14,532
So Min.

852
00:30:16,668 --> 00:30:19,070
We'll be fine if she doesn't betray us.

853
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,040
I...

854
00:30:22,774 --> 00:30:24,209
made a promise.

855
00:30:26,878 --> 00:30:29,080
(Is she really paying?)

856
00:30:31,382 --> 00:30:33,151
To get my reputation back,

857
00:30:33,418 --> 00:30:34,786
I'll do as I promised.

858
00:30:35,053 --> 00:30:37,555
(Is she really paying 20 dollars?)

859
00:30:37,555 --> 00:30:38,823
I was also water bombed.

860
00:30:38,823 --> 00:30:40,959
(She keeps her promise for the first time.)

861
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:43,161
(She decides to become trustworthy.)

862
00:30:43,862 --> 00:30:45,163
(Next is the team leader, Su Jin,)

863
00:30:45,163 --> 00:30:47,165
(who promised to pay 20 dollars.)

864
00:30:47,165 --> 00:30:48,166
(Moving slowly)

865
00:30:50,969 --> 00:30:53,738
(Su Jin also pays 20 dollars.)

866
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:56,374
(We can win by paying the minimum.)

867
00:30:56,374 --> 00:30:58,810
(Two members of Team White keep their promises.)

868
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,712
We'll win if we pay the minimum.

869
00:31:00,712 --> 00:31:02,113
(Did the rest pay 10 dollars each?)

870
00:31:02,113 --> 00:31:03,381
(All members finish paying.)

871
00:31:03,381 --> 00:31:05,750
I'll announce the total amount...

872
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,019
- of the losing team. - Okay.

873
00:31:08,553 --> 00:31:10,522
- Here's the result of Round One. - Please.

874
00:31:11,322 --> 00:31:12,924
It should be 90 dollars.

875
00:31:12,924 --> 00:31:14,392
It should be 90.

876
00:31:14,459 --> 00:31:16,761
We'll win if we pay the minimum.

877
00:31:16,761 --> 00:31:19,164
(If Jong Kook, Haha, and Se Chan kept the promise, Team White wins.)

878
00:31:19,164 --> 00:31:21,499
(Here's the result of Round 1.)

879
00:31:21,499 --> 00:31:22,534
The total is 50 dollars.

880
00:31:23,234 --> 00:31:24,235
The scores are tied.

881
00:31:24,936 --> 00:31:25,970
- Really? - Gosh.

882
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,906
(The total is 50 dollars.)

883
00:31:27,906 --> 00:31:30,208
(There's no winner.)

884
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:32,644
- Wasn't I right? - The scores are tied.

885
00:31:32,644 --> 00:31:34,212
(Everyone looks at Seok Jin.)

886
00:31:34,212 --> 00:31:36,381
- Seok Jin. - How much did you pay?

887
00:31:36,881 --> 00:31:37,982
You didn't pay, did you?

888
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:39,717
- I paid. - I paid too.

889
00:31:39,717 --> 00:31:41,619
- I really paid. - I can prove it.

890
00:31:41,619 --> 00:31:42,987
Then how is this possible?

891
00:31:42,987 --> 00:31:45,390
- How much did you pay? - I can't show you.

892
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,458
- Me? - Come on, Han Na.

893
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:49,427
- You promised! - You didn't pay.

894
00:31:49,427 --> 00:31:51,029
- I paid. - No, you didn't.

895
00:31:51,029 --> 00:31:53,731
I did, but I paid less than what I promised.

896
00:31:53,731 --> 00:31:55,366
- Did you pay? - I did.

897
00:31:55,366 --> 00:31:56,434
- I paid. - You didn't, did you?

898
00:31:56,434 --> 00:31:58,069
- I paid 10 dollars. - Really?

899
00:31:58,069 --> 00:31:59,437
- How about you? - I paid.

900
00:31:59,904 --> 00:32:01,039
Come on, So Min.

901
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,241
- So Min. - Why didn't you pay?

902
00:32:03,241 --> 00:32:05,977
I really paid. I want to cry.

903
00:32:05,977 --> 00:32:07,679
- I paid 20 dollars. - You didn't pay, did you?

904
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:08,880
I can show you.

905
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,949
What's wrong with you, So Min?

906
00:32:10,982 --> 00:32:12,550
- This is so unfair. - Wait.

907
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,419
- Han Na. - Who didn't pay?

908
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:15,820
- Come on. - You didn't pay.

909
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,021
- Gosh, So Min. - It was So Min.

910
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:18,523
Someone should tell them the truth.

911
00:32:18,656 --> 00:32:19,691
- Seriously. - You said you would deposit.

912
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:21,859
- It was the minimum. - It's you who didn't pay.

913
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:23,928
- Why didn't you pay the minimum? - You really didn't pay.

914
00:32:23,962 --> 00:32:25,463
- I paid 20 dollars. - Here's what I think.

915
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,732
- I really paid. - Me too.

916
00:32:27,732 --> 00:32:29,167
Two people didn't pay.

917
00:32:29,634 --> 00:32:30,735
Two people didn't pay.

918
00:32:30,735 --> 00:32:32,237
I paid 20 dollars.

919
00:32:32,237 --> 00:32:33,504
Stop lying.

920
00:32:33,504 --> 00:32:34,872
- I swear that I paid. - That's so mean.

921
00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:36,541
You didn't pay 20 dollars.

922
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:38,543
- I'm innocent. - Two people didn't pay.

923
00:32:38,543 --> 00:32:40,044
- Our team leader paid. - I'm serious.

924
00:32:40,044 --> 00:32:42,714
- We couldn't win because of you. - Okay.

925
00:32:42,714 --> 00:32:43,881
Our team leader paid.

926
00:32:44,215 --> 00:32:45,250
- She did. - Two people didn't.

927
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,451
She looks like she paid.

928
00:32:46,451 --> 00:32:47,652
(No one trusts each other.)

929
00:32:47,652 --> 00:32:49,988
(What will happen in the next round?)

930
00:32:50,788 --> 00:32:53,491
(They move onto the next mission site.)

931
00:32:53,491 --> 00:32:57,295
We asked you to sit with your team members.

932
00:32:57,729 --> 00:33:00,765
Why is Kwang Soo sitting between two women?

933
00:33:00,765 --> 00:33:02,233
(What's the reason?)

934
00:33:02,233 --> 00:33:03,968
- We talked about it. - It was because of me.

935
00:33:03,968 --> 00:33:06,738
It's because So Min changed her seat.

936
00:33:06,738 --> 00:33:08,339
- Why did you sit there? - It's a present from me.

937
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:10,508
- Like this? Okay. - Okay.

938
00:33:10,508 --> 00:33:12,377
Change your seat with Se Chan.

939
00:33:12,377 --> 00:33:13,378
With Se Chan? Okay.

940
00:33:13,378 --> 00:33:14,879
What's the matter?

941
00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:17,048
- You can't stand sitting there? - Is it that bad?

942
00:33:17,048 --> 00:33:18,383
- So Min told me to sit here. - What's going on?

943
00:33:18,383 --> 00:33:19,384
Do you like Su Jin that much?

944
00:33:19,384 --> 00:33:20,752
- Can't you stand it? - All the seats...

945
00:33:20,752 --> 00:33:22,553
- were taken. - He doesn't talk to me at all.

946
00:33:22,553 --> 00:33:23,955
(Kwang Soo doesn't talk to me.)

947
00:33:23,955 --> 00:33:26,157
- What do you mean? - He's like that.

948
00:33:26,157 --> 00:33:28,626
He only shows the side of his face...

949
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,461
- when he's next to you. - I'm always criticized...

950
00:33:30,461 --> 00:33:33,364
whether I talk or not.

951
00:33:33,665 --> 00:33:34,699
- The profile of your face... - What should I do?

952
00:33:34,699 --> 00:33:35,967
isn't handsome.

953
00:33:35,967 --> 00:33:37,568
What are you talking about?

954
00:33:37,869 --> 00:33:39,437
You'll stand out.

955
00:33:40,438 --> 00:33:42,740
How could you do that, Seok Jin?

956
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,376
- How could you deposit nothing? - I deposited 30 dollars.

957
00:33:45,376 --> 00:33:48,313
- I bet Jae Seok didn't pay. - Jae Seok is more suspicious.

958
00:33:48,313 --> 00:33:50,181
- We know the truth. - Right?

959
00:33:50,181 --> 00:33:51,716
They're trying to set me up.

960
00:33:51,716 --> 00:33:54,552
- If you had paid... - They're lying about the hint.

961
00:33:54,552 --> 00:33:56,721
Why didn't you pay when you make...

962
00:33:56,721 --> 00:33:57,989
so many donations?

963
00:33:57,989 --> 00:34:00,725
(Jae Seok makes donations to earthquake victims in Pohang.)

964
00:34:00,725 --> 00:34:02,627
- Was 10 dollars too much? - Goodness.

965
00:34:02,627 --> 00:34:04,529
(Jae Seok turns into a miser.)

966
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:07,065
- All he had to pay was the minimum. - I can't believe it.

967
00:34:07,732 --> 00:34:10,234
- This is making me angry. - 10 dollars isn't much.

968
00:34:10,234 --> 00:34:11,969
You should have paid 10 dollars.

969
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:14,238
- Don't you have an conscience? - Even Su Jin is accusing me.

970
00:34:14,238 --> 00:34:17,442
He swore to us with his hand on his chest.

971
00:34:17,442 --> 00:34:18,743
He said that he paid.

972
00:34:18,743 --> 00:34:20,611
- Where did he put his hand? - Where?

973
00:34:20,611 --> 00:34:22,213
- Where was it exactly? - There.

974
00:34:22,213 --> 00:34:25,950
That's not the chest.

975
00:34:26,017 --> 00:34:27,385
His chest is right here.

976
00:34:27,385 --> 00:34:30,288
- Come on. - This is where his chest is.

977
00:34:30,788 --> 00:34:33,324
He's telling the truth if he puts his hand here.

978
00:34:33,324 --> 00:34:34,926
- That's ridiculous. - This isn't his chest.

979
00:34:34,926 --> 00:34:37,428
- It's on the appendix. - That makes no sense.

980
00:34:37,595 --> 00:34:39,530
To be honest,

981
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:41,265
it's surprising that there was even 50 dollars in total.

982
00:34:41,799 --> 00:34:43,968
- I trusted our team members. - Listen.

983
00:34:43,968 --> 00:34:46,537
If I could turn back time, I'd take my money back.

984
00:34:46,537 --> 00:34:48,172
I really paid 10 dollars.

985
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:49,741
I saw their faces when the total was announced.

986
00:34:49,741 --> 00:34:51,709
Kwang Soo looked so shocked.

987
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:53,611
I really paid 10 dollars.

988
00:34:53,611 --> 00:34:55,179
- I paid. - He definitely didn't pay.

989
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:58,249
I think Ji Hyo paid 20, I paid 20, and she paid 10.

990
00:34:58,249 --> 00:34:59,484
Neither of them paid anything.

991
00:34:59,484 --> 00:35:01,152
How much you have individually is important.

992
00:35:01,152 --> 00:35:02,153
Right.

993
00:35:02,387 --> 00:35:05,323
Next mission is called 5-Second Logic Game.

994
00:35:05,323 --> 00:35:07,692
(5-Second Logic Game)

995
00:35:08,693 --> 00:35:10,328
- What's that? - It's difficult.

996
00:35:10,328 --> 00:35:11,362
Do we play in order?

997
00:35:11,362 --> 00:35:13,131
(What is 5-Second Logic Game?)

998
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:16,033
It's a team game. If you make a logical sentence with...

999
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:19,771
five given words in order, you clear the mission.

1000
00:35:19,771 --> 00:35:21,739
- In order? - 10 dollars will be taken away...

1001
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:23,141
from a member of the losing team.

1002
00:35:23,441 --> 00:35:24,809
- You'll take it away? - Yes.

1003
00:35:24,809 --> 00:35:25,843
(10 dollars will be deducted.)

1004
00:35:25,843 --> 00:35:27,745
- From anyone? - It can't be mine.

1005
00:35:28,346 --> 00:35:30,548
Once someone with experience plays the game,

1006
00:35:30,548 --> 00:35:32,150
everyone will understand.

1007
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,985
- Let's play without practice. - Okay.

1008
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:35,653
Jae Seok is good at it.

1009
00:35:35,653 --> 00:35:37,655
- I'm very good. - Jae Seok should play.

1010
00:35:37,655 --> 00:35:39,590
Let's start with Jae Seok.

1011
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,591
Okay.

1012
00:35:40,591 --> 00:35:42,360
Start.

1013
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,530
Crown of the head, did you use the bathroom?

1014
00:35:46,097 --> 00:35:47,265
Was Kwang Soo there?

1015
00:35:47,698 --> 00:35:49,133
- Jack Spot... - He fails.

1016
00:35:49,133 --> 00:35:51,135
(He can't continue the sentence.)

1017
00:35:51,135 --> 00:35:53,571
What kind of demonstration was that?

1018
00:35:53,671 --> 00:35:55,540
There are people who don't understand.

1019
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,241
They'll misunderstand.

1020
00:35:57,742 --> 00:36:01,879
(What kind of game is this?)

1021
00:36:02,613 --> 00:36:04,749
- Why is he talking that way? - Haha.

1022
00:36:04,749 --> 00:36:06,551
Tell them that I'll try again.

1023
00:36:06,551 --> 00:36:08,019
"Crown of the head."

1024
00:36:08,653 --> 00:36:10,154
"Did you use the bathroom?"

1025
00:36:10,221 --> 00:36:11,789
Do we speak with an accent?

1026
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:13,324
- I'll try again. -"Crown of the head."

1027
00:36:13,324 --> 00:36:14,859
- Hey. - "Did you use the bathroom?"

1028
00:36:14,859 --> 00:36:16,494
- Let's go. - Let's do it.

1029
00:36:16,494 --> 00:36:18,596
Everyone, you should read more books.

1030
00:36:18,763 --> 00:36:21,699
If you read more books,

1031
00:36:21,799 --> 00:36:24,902
- you can make sentences easily. - That's good.

1032
00:36:24,902 --> 00:36:26,370
- That sounds good. - You should read books.

1033
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,805
- Besides, we're in Busan. - Get ready.

1034
00:36:27,805 --> 00:36:31,075
- We should speak with their accent. - Right.

1035
00:36:31,075 --> 00:36:33,177
- Start, let's go. - Next is Se Chan.

1036
00:36:33,244 --> 00:36:35,279
- Go. - Have you been to New Zealand?

1037
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:36,614
That's where I broke up.

1038
00:36:36,614 --> 00:36:38,616
While riding a jet boat, Kwang Soo's pants...

1039
00:36:38,616 --> 00:36:41,385
(Kwang Soo's pants?)

1040
00:36:41,385 --> 00:36:43,421
(Se Chan fails.)

1041
00:36:43,421 --> 00:36:45,723
- What did he say? - What did you say?

1042
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,092
You should read more.

1043
00:36:48,092 --> 00:36:50,061
- What did he say? - You should read more books.

1044
00:36:50,061 --> 00:36:52,263
You should read more books.

1045
00:36:52,363 --> 00:36:53,865
- Did I doze off while reading? - That didn't make sense.

1046
00:36:53,865 --> 00:36:55,533
(He blurts out sentences that make no sense.)

1047
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,568
- Kwang Soo, you should try. - Sure.

1048
00:36:57,568 --> 00:36:58,736
Jae Seok, let me try this.

1049
00:36:58,736 --> 00:37:00,137
- I need to be quick on my feet. - Exactly.

1050
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:01,405
- I just need to focus. - Precisely.

1051
00:37:01,405 --> 00:37:03,140
Get ready. Start.

1052
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:05,676
So Min will be my love interest.

1053
00:37:05,943 --> 00:37:07,011
It started in Darwin...

1054
00:37:07,345 --> 00:37:10,014
when we got waxed with crocodiles.

1055
00:37:10,715 --> 00:37:11,949
(Kwang Soo succeeds.)

1056
00:37:11,949 --> 00:37:13,217
- You did it. - Okay!

1057
00:37:13,217 --> 00:37:15,019
- You did it. - No way.

1058
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:16,120
- Where is Darwin? - He got waxed...

1059
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,288
- What's "Darwin"? - This doesn't count.

1060
00:37:17,288 --> 00:37:19,190
- It's a name of a region. - It's a name of a city.

1061
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,725
- It's where we faced our penalty. - It's in Australia.

1062
00:37:20,992 --> 00:37:22,693
- Really? - It makes sense, doesn't it?

1063
00:37:22,693 --> 00:37:25,029
Kwang Soo, we did that in Darwin?

1064
00:37:25,029 --> 00:37:26,864
(We did that in Darwin?)

1065
00:37:26,864 --> 00:37:27,899
You were each other's love interests.

1066
00:37:27,899 --> 00:37:29,634
I was just making up. It was just a sentence.

1067
00:37:29,634 --> 00:37:30,968
(Were we each other's love interests?)

1068
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:33,237
Their potential love affair started from So Min's house.

1069
00:37:33,905 --> 00:37:35,640
Didn't it start from So Min's house?

1070
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,174
- What are you talking about? - I'm right about this!

1071
00:37:37,174 --> 00:37:39,310
- There was no love affair. - You should come clean about it.

1072
00:37:39,844 --> 00:37:42,780
Su Jin, you can choose a member,

1073
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,615
and the chosen member will pay 10 dollars.

1074
00:37:44,615 --> 00:37:47,018
But someone probably didn't pay 10 dollars earlier, right?

1075
00:37:47,018 --> 00:37:48,152
Or two people might not have.

1076
00:37:48,219 --> 00:37:49,720
- Let's be honest. - I really paid 20 dollars.

1077
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,988
Why don't you pay? Okay?

1078
00:37:50,988 --> 00:37:52,590
(So Min, you didn't pay the money earlier, right?)

1079
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,592
- I bet they're Haha and So Min. - I paid 20 dollars.

1080
00:37:54,592 --> 00:37:56,994
Jae Seok, I really put down 20 dollars. I'm serious.

1081
00:37:56,994 --> 00:37:59,030
If you pay 10 dollars now,

1082
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,431
I'll believe that you paid 20 dollars.

1083
00:38:00,431 --> 00:38:03,301
- She wouldn't put down 20 dollars. - Exactly.

1084
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:06,571
So Min, don't you dare lie!

1085
00:38:06,571 --> 00:38:07,638
(He suddenly speaks with an accent.)

1086
00:38:07,638 --> 00:38:09,140
Hey, you. I'm going to...

1087
00:38:10,241 --> 00:38:11,242
(There comes Choi Min Sik.)

1088
00:38:11,242 --> 00:38:12,443
She's getting mad now.

1089
00:38:12,443 --> 00:38:14,779
Hey, I even went to the sauna with Dream.

1090
00:38:14,779 --> 00:38:18,649
(Dream is Haha's son.)

1091
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,319
(Choi Min Sik's impression is the only one she can do.)

1092
00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:23,421
(She does the impression again.)

1093
00:38:23,521 --> 00:38:26,090
- He's too young to go to a sauna. - Why would you go there with him?

1094
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,158
Who is Dream?

1095
00:38:27,158 --> 00:38:30,094
- Smelly Hair, you better watch out. - You're...

1096
00:38:30,094 --> 00:38:33,598
- Dream's dad, right? - How dare you get my son involved?

1097
00:38:33,631 --> 00:38:34,899
- Seriously? - Hey.

1098
00:38:35,232 --> 00:38:37,468
- Isn't the accent from North Korea? - I feel so wronged.

1099
00:38:37,468 --> 00:38:38,903
- What are you saying? - Hey.

1100
00:38:39,036 --> 00:38:40,271
Isn't that from Hamgyong Province?

1101
00:38:40,371 --> 00:38:42,139
- Hamgyong Province. - Is it from that province?

1102
00:38:43,641 --> 00:38:45,443
Let's play rock-paper-scissors. That's fair.

1103
00:38:45,443 --> 00:38:46,611
- Let's do that. - Okay.

1104
00:38:46,611 --> 00:38:48,012
- All right. - Get ready.

1105
00:38:48,012 --> 00:38:50,948
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1106
00:38:50,948 --> 00:38:52,950
(So Min and Jong Kook lose.)

1107
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:54,885
- Okay! - Yes!

1108
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:56,420
- This is great. - My goodness.

1109
00:38:56,721 --> 00:38:59,156
(I can't believe this.)

1110
00:38:59,423 --> 00:39:01,759
- You're being punished. - You deserve it.

1111
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:04,695
My gosh, this is one filthy world.

1112
00:39:04,695 --> 00:39:06,597
Did you just realize that?

1113
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:07,999
So Min, pay 10 dollars.

1114
00:39:07,999 --> 00:39:09,700
So Min.

1115
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,302
(Will So Min have to pay?)

1116
00:39:11,302 --> 00:39:13,371
- So Min. - I was going to lead a good life.

1117
00:39:13,671 --> 00:39:14,672
- Rock-paper-scissors - You'll have to pay.

1118
00:39:14,672 --> 00:39:15,840
(Whoever loses will pay 10 dollars.)

1119
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,074
Rock-paper-scissors

1120
00:39:17,074 --> 00:39:18,909
(Whoever loses will pay 10 dollars.)

1121
00:39:18,909 --> 00:39:22,279
(Can So Min, who thinks the world is filthy, keep her 10 dollars?)

1122
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:26,450
(Poor So Min! She loses the game.)

1123
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,152
- So Min, you must pay 10 dollars. - So Min.

1124
00:39:28,152 --> 00:39:29,553
- You must pay it now. - You're doomed.

1125
00:39:29,553 --> 00:39:30,655
So she ends up paying it.

1126
00:39:30,655 --> 00:39:33,057
- Is it your first time paying? - Are you paying it?

1127
00:39:33,691 --> 00:39:35,693
So Min, I saw this coming for you.

1128
00:39:35,693 --> 00:39:37,194
(Unbelievable. The world is so not fair!)

1129
00:39:38,095 --> 00:39:39,764
(A restaurant next to the sea)

1130
00:39:39,764 --> 00:39:41,532
This is a crab restaurant.

1131
00:39:41,532 --> 00:39:43,134
(Why are there boxes with crab drawings?)

1132
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:47,738
A chance card and meal tickets are at stake for this mission.

1133
00:39:47,738 --> 00:39:49,840
(A chance card and meal tickets are at stake for this mission.)

1134
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,308
(They can get both the chance card and meal tickets.)

1135
00:39:51,308 --> 00:39:53,110
- Hey, our meals depend on this. - This is for the meal tickets.

1136
00:39:53,244 --> 00:39:55,379
- Food! - Food!

1137
00:39:55,613 --> 00:39:57,281
(All of a sudden, they feel competitive.)

1138
00:39:57,281 --> 00:39:58,783
- We must win. - We can eat crabs.

1139
00:39:58,949 --> 00:40:00,484
- We must eat these. - Hey, I thought...

1140
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:02,019
- I actually like... - Look at the crab shells.

1141
00:40:02,053 --> 00:40:04,321
I really like shellfish.

1142
00:40:04,321 --> 00:40:06,057
- What is that? - Can you smell it?

1143
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,591
- It looks delicious. - My gosh.

1144
00:40:07,692 --> 00:40:09,260
- It looks so good. - Seriously.

1145
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,830
(The crab shells are the tastiest. They are perfect with rice.)

1146
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,532
It looks really good.

1147
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:17,468
- You can't eat it yet. - Put that down.

1148
00:40:17,735 --> 00:40:19,570
- It looks so good. - We can't even touch them.

1149
00:40:19,637 --> 00:40:23,140
A chance card and meal tickets are at stake for this mission.

1150
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,342
The mission is called Box Sweeper.

1151
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:26,610
- Box Sweeper? - Box Sweeper?

1152
00:40:26,744 --> 00:40:28,512
Two members from each team will play the game.

1153
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:30,948
They will choose random boxes and cross by stepping on the boxes.

1154
00:40:31,482 --> 00:40:34,051
You may dance to the song until I blow the whistle.

1155
00:40:34,051 --> 00:40:35,820
Then stand on the box of your choice.

1156
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,489
For the first box, you must step on the box in front of you.

1157
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:42,093
After that, you can choose the boxes freely and continue on.

1158
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,595
If you fall into a box with ice water, you're out.

1159
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:45,863
There's ice water?

1160
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:47,264
(If they fall into a box with ice water, they're eliminated.)

1161
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:49,366
When everyone is done crossing,

1162
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:51,068
the team with a higher number of survivors wins.

1163
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:52,970
The boxes have ice water in them?

1164
00:40:53,804 --> 00:40:56,407
- In that case, we will... - Let's choose Ji Hyo.

1165
00:40:56,407 --> 00:40:58,075
- choose Ji Hyo. - She's mostly lucky.

1166
00:40:58,075 --> 00:40:59,243
Ji Hyo...

1167
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,845
- and Seok Jin will play. - Me?

1168
00:41:00,945 --> 00:41:02,012
- Ji Hyo and Seok Jin. - Okay!

1169
00:41:02,446 --> 00:41:03,781
Jee and Ji Siblings.

1170
00:41:04,482 --> 00:41:07,485
(This is the combination of lucky and unlucky members.)

1171
00:41:08,152 --> 00:41:09,720
- Which one of us should try? - Anyone can try it.

1172
00:41:10,321 --> 00:41:11,989
- Then you should play. - Sure.

1173
00:41:12,323 --> 00:41:14,492
So Min and I will play this game.

1174
00:41:15,259 --> 00:41:16,594
- Let's go. - Let's do this!

1175
00:41:16,994 --> 00:41:17,995
Okay.

1176
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:20,765
(Seok Jin and Ji Hyo versus So Min and Se Chan)

1177
00:41:21,198 --> 00:41:22,233
We'll begin now.

1178
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:26,303
(They will dance before choosing their positions.)

1179
00:41:27,404 --> 00:41:29,240
(He dances like an old man. He looks silly.)

1180
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,242
My goodness. That's terrible.

1181
00:41:31,842 --> 00:41:33,010
(That's my box!)

1182
00:41:33,844 --> 00:41:37,348
(Should I move up to the stage now?)

1183
00:41:37,348 --> 00:41:38,883
Seriously. This is such an eye sore.

1184
00:41:39,116 --> 00:41:40,351
I hate it.

1185
00:41:40,785 --> 00:41:42,419
Her dance doesn't suit the song at all.

1186
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:43,554
What's wrong with your move?

1187
00:41:43,554 --> 00:41:44,822
Seriously.

1188
00:41:45,189 --> 00:41:46,390
I hate it so much.

1189
00:41:46,991 --> 00:41:48,459
(You... You are something else.)

1190
00:41:48,459 --> 00:41:50,161
- Unbelievable. - Stop shaking your bottom.

1191
00:41:50,161 --> 00:41:52,596
- I hate So Min's dance. - Look at So Min's bottom.

1192
00:41:52,763 --> 00:41:54,198
I hate it.

1193
00:41:54,765 --> 00:41:56,233
I seriously don't like her dance.

1194
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,803
- We need to eat crab. - Let's eat crab!

1195
00:41:59,904 --> 00:42:01,305
(Their dance time before choosing the boxes is over.)

1196
00:42:01,305 --> 00:42:02,573
- Okay. - Okay.

1197
00:42:02,673 --> 00:42:05,509
(They finish selecting the positions while dancing.)

1198
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:09,013
(For the first move, they must step on the box in front of them.)

1199
00:42:09,013 --> 00:42:10,748
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

1200
00:42:11,515 --> 00:42:16,821
(Which one will be the first to fall into the ice water?)

1201
00:42:18,389 --> 00:42:20,591
(Splashing)

1202
00:42:20,591 --> 00:42:22,493
Okay. He had to be eliminated anyway.

1203
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,861
That was bound to happen.

1204
00:42:23,861 --> 00:42:25,095
How could that happen?

1205
00:42:25,596 --> 00:42:26,764
How is that possible?

1206
00:42:27,364 --> 00:42:28,766
How is this possible?

1207
00:42:28,766 --> 00:42:29,800
(Seok Jin is out.)

1208
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,035
How on earth...

1209
00:42:31,135 --> 00:42:33,470
From this point on, you can choose any boxes you want.

1210
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,839
It's up to you.

1211
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:36,073
Se Chan, that's the box.

1212
00:42:36,073 --> 00:42:37,408
- Okay. - Let's get it.

1213
00:42:37,408 --> 00:42:39,009
Pick one in front of Seok Jin's box. There won't be another one there.

1214
00:42:39,009 --> 00:42:40,511
He has a point.

1215
00:42:41,111 --> 00:42:42,880
- You'll jump at the same time. - Jump at the same time.

1216
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,948
- I'm going this way. - One!

1217
00:42:43,948 --> 00:42:45,049
- Are you going that way? - Yes.

1218
00:42:45,049 --> 00:42:46,717
- 1, 2, - If you move forward...

1219
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:48,519
3.

1220
00:42:49,653 --> 00:42:52,690
(Which one will be the second one to fall into the ice water?)

1221
00:42:57,061 --> 00:42:58,195
My gosh, everyone made it.

1222
00:42:58,195 --> 00:42:59,830
(Se Chan, So Min, and Ji Hyo all pass.)

1223
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:01,198
- Everyone made it. - Everyone passed.

1224
00:43:01,198 --> 00:43:02,366
(Se Chan, So Min, and Ji Hyo all pass.)

1225
00:43:02,366 --> 00:43:04,268
- Everyone passed? - My gosh.

1226
00:43:04,969 --> 00:43:06,170
I'll choose the one in front of me.

1227
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:07,304
I'll do the same then.

1228
00:43:07,805 --> 00:43:08,839
I'll move forward.

1229
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:10,341
- I think this one is a good one. - That one looks great.

1230
00:43:10,341 --> 00:43:11,475
- This one? - Yes.

1231
00:43:11,575 --> 00:43:13,244
- The whole line seems good. - You never know.

1232
00:43:13,611 --> 00:43:15,012
Ji Hyo, just trust your instinct.

1233
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:16,347
So Min, you should choose that one.

1234
00:43:16,347 --> 00:43:17,615
(Which way should I go?)

1235
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:20,117
- 1, 2, 3. - What will I do?

1236
00:43:20,117 --> 00:43:21,318
(What's the result of the third box?)

1237
00:43:23,821 --> 00:43:25,689
(Screaming)

1238
00:43:25,923 --> 00:43:27,324
We need to beat one more member.

1239
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:28,993
Let's just beat one more member.

1240
00:43:29,093 --> 00:43:30,261
- Ji Hyo. - Here we go.

1241
00:43:30,261 --> 00:43:32,129
1, 2, 3.

1242
00:43:34,398 --> 00:43:35,532
Okay!

1243
00:43:35,532 --> 00:43:37,735
(Se Chan makes it to the third row safely.)

1244
00:43:37,801 --> 00:43:38,869
- Okay! - 1 of 2 is a good one.

1245
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:40,537
It's either this or that. Ji Hyo, it's 1 of these 2.

1246
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,239
- That was good, wasn't it? - Which one has a better chance?

1247
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:43,340
- We're not sure about this one. - Exactly.

1248
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,175
- This is likely to be safe. - This box has a better chance.

1249
00:43:45,509 --> 00:43:46,677
All right.

1250
00:43:47,444 --> 00:43:48,612
Are you serious, So Min?

1251
00:43:48,612 --> 00:43:51,615
(She suddenly dances to celebrate Se Chan's success.)

1252
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:53,784
Get out of the way!

1253
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,422
- 1, 2, 3. - I don't know anymore.

1254
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:02,927
(What's the result of the box Ji Hyo chooses?)

1255
00:44:03,093 --> 00:44:05,596
(Ji Hyo makes it to the third row just like Se Chan.)

1256
00:44:05,596 --> 00:44:07,197
- What's the deal with her? - We need to get through one more.

1257
00:44:07,197 --> 00:44:08,299
She's amazing.

1258
00:44:08,299 --> 00:44:09,533
We only have one row to go.

1259
00:44:10,634 --> 00:44:12,403
(Se Chan is feeling nervous for some reason.)

1260
00:44:12,403 --> 00:44:13,971
- Se Chan, move forward. - Forward?

1261
00:44:13,971 --> 00:44:15,439
Se Chan, move forward.

1262
00:44:15,439 --> 00:44:17,174
- Okay, I'll take your advice. - My gosh, this...

1263
00:44:17,174 --> 00:44:18,509
- Move forward. - That one looks safe.

1264
00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:19,944
- No, I'll listen to Su Jin. - Choose that box.

1265
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,178
I'll take your advice.

1266
00:44:21,512 --> 00:44:22,579
Is that the box?

1267
00:44:23,113 --> 00:44:24,114
- Okay, I'll choose it. - She's the leader.

1268
00:44:24,715 --> 00:44:25,783
Ji Hyo, follow your instinct.

1269
00:44:25,783 --> 00:44:26,884
(He repeats his advice.)

1270
00:44:27,885 --> 00:44:31,588
(Will Su Jin's decision win? Or will Ji Hyo's instinct win?)

1271
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:33,490
- 1, 2, - This one?

1272
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:35,960
- 1, 2, 3. - This one?

1273
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:41,498
(Who will be the final winner?)

1274
00:44:45,803 --> 00:44:48,172
(Both members fail to choose.)

1275
00:44:48,172 --> 00:44:49,840
- Both of them fell. - Both of them fell.

1276
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,241
- Both of them fell into the water. - That was close.

1277
00:44:51,575 --> 00:44:52,943
- What a bummer. - I told you so.

1278
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:55,245
- The boxes can't be in a row. - Both of them fell into the water.

1279
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:57,014
Hey, Ms. Team Leader.

1280
00:44:57,348 --> 00:44:58,382
But she fell too.

1281
00:44:58,382 --> 00:44:59,883
- The first round is tied. - We are tied.

1282
00:44:59,883 --> 00:45:01,885
(Team White and Team Red both fail.)

1283
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,822
(Kwang Soo and Han Na versus Su Jin and Jong Kook)

1284
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:07,291
- I'm excited for this round. - Me too.

1285
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:09,460
- I have a good feeling about this. - This is going to be fun.

1286
00:45:09,493 --> 00:45:11,495
- Han Na majored in ballet. - Yes.

1287
00:45:11,495 --> 00:45:13,030
- Han Na. - That's right.

1288
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,765
- Can you do ballet for us? - Can you show us?

1289
00:45:14,765 --> 00:45:15,966
What should I do?

1290
00:45:15,966 --> 00:45:16,967
(She feels pressured.)

1291
00:45:17,267 --> 00:45:18,669
Here it goes. Go, go, go!

1292
00:45:19,536 --> 00:45:20,571
What do I do?

1293
00:45:20,904 --> 00:45:22,673
(A familiar song, "Chococo" is played.)

1294
00:45:24,508 --> 00:45:25,709
Shake it.

1295
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:29,013
(Everyone starts dancing to the song, "Chococo".)

1296
00:45:29,246 --> 00:45:30,981
(She looks confused alone.)

1297
00:45:32,016 --> 00:45:34,284
- That's right. - Han Na, you can just dance.

1298
00:45:34,284 --> 00:45:35,319
Just dance however you want.

1299
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:36,620
I don't know what to do.

1300
00:45:38,689 --> 00:45:39,990
What's up with her dance?

1301
00:45:40,491 --> 00:45:42,593
- Why do you dance like an old man? - Han Na, you're doing well.

1302
00:45:44,528 --> 00:45:45,629
(Oh, boy!)

1303
00:45:45,629 --> 00:45:46,830
I don't know what to do.

1304
00:45:47,631 --> 00:45:50,401
(This is a wrong mix of ballet and random dance.)

1305
00:45:52,302 --> 00:45:53,570
I don't know what to do.

1306
00:45:53,737 --> 00:45:55,339
What is that? What is Han Na doing?

1307
00:45:55,439 --> 00:45:57,574
What is the dance Han Na's doing? What is that?

1308
00:45:57,574 --> 00:45:59,443
- What's wrong with her? - Did she really major in ballet?

1309
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:00,611
Han Na.

1310
00:46:00,611 --> 00:46:01,879
(She doesn't feel shy anymore.)

1311
00:46:01,879 --> 00:46:02,880
I don't know.

1312
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,149
(Jong Kook dances in an elegant manner with his muscular biceps.)

1313
00:46:06,784 --> 00:46:07,785
Hey, stand behind the boxes.

1314
00:46:08,152 --> 00:46:09,153
(Shaking)

1315
00:46:09,153 --> 00:46:10,988
- Han Na is doing great. - They are...

1316
00:46:10,988 --> 00:46:13,590
- They're terrible dancers, right? - Han Na.

1317
00:46:13,924 --> 00:46:15,426
I love Han Na's dance. I love it.

1318
00:46:15,426 --> 00:46:16,994
(Their dance time is over.)

1319
00:46:17,761 --> 00:46:20,230
(Everyone chooses the boxes in their original positions.)

1320
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:21,632
- Are you sure that's the box? - Move back.

1321
00:46:22,466 --> 00:46:24,368
I have a bad feeling about Kwang Soo's box.

1322
00:46:26,737 --> 00:46:28,906
- Here I go. I must succeed. - I think he'll fall.

1323
00:46:28,906 --> 00:46:30,174
I have a feeling I'll fall.

1324
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:32,843
(They must win this round to get the chance card.)

1325
00:46:32,843 --> 00:46:34,578
- Here I go. I must succeed. - I think he'll fall.

1326
00:46:34,745 --> 00:46:37,281
1, 2, 3.

1327
00:46:42,553 --> 00:46:44,054
(Falling)

1328
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:46,156
I like it! We are off to a great start!

1329
00:46:47,091 --> 00:46:48,258
I like it.

1330
00:46:48,258 --> 00:46:49,560
(Laughing)

1331
00:46:52,029 --> 00:46:53,697
(Jong Kook is unlucky!)

1332
00:46:53,697 --> 00:46:55,966
It's so cold!

1333
00:46:57,768 --> 00:47:00,070
I haven't hit Kwang Soo in a while.

1334
00:47:00,137 --> 00:47:01,972
- Okay, I'm sorry. - Do well.

1335
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,309
- Good job, Jong Kook. - Good job.

1336
00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:07,311
- Amazing. - Good job.

1337
00:47:07,744 --> 00:47:09,179
It didn't feel right.

1338
00:47:09,179 --> 00:47:10,614
All right. Next.

1339
00:47:10,614 --> 00:47:11,882
(It's the second row.)

1340
00:47:12,749 --> 00:47:13,750
Have you decided?

1341
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,385
- This one. - This one?

1342
00:47:15,786 --> 00:47:17,154
- What about you, Han Na? - What?

1343
00:47:17,221 --> 00:47:18,489
Me?

1344
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:19,823
This one.

1345
00:47:20,991 --> 00:47:23,193
(Who will pass the second row?)

1346
00:47:25,963 --> 00:47:27,764
(Su Jin passes the second row.)

1347
00:47:27,865 --> 00:47:30,300
- Nice. - Good job.

1348
00:47:30,534 --> 00:47:31,568
This one.

1349
00:47:31,568 --> 00:47:32,569
(Team White's leader succeeded.)

1350
00:47:32,569 --> 00:47:35,072
(What about Team Red's leader?)

1351
00:47:39,843 --> 00:47:41,512
My goodness. This is scary.

1352
00:47:41,512 --> 00:47:43,180
Kwang Soo, bye.

1353
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,882
- Kwang Soo's last try. - Bye.

1354
00:47:44,882 --> 00:47:46,350
Bye, Kwang Soo.

1355
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:48,018
- Bye. - You've lasted long.

1356
00:47:48,018 --> 00:47:49,052
You might succeed.

1357
00:47:49,153 --> 00:47:50,654
Goodbye.

1358
00:47:50,654 --> 00:47:52,089
All right. Let's do this.

1359
00:47:52,089 --> 00:47:53,590
- Bye. - Bye.

1360
00:47:54,424 --> 00:47:55,759
- 1, 2, 3. - Bye, Kwang Soo.

1361
00:47:56,493 --> 00:47:58,629
(Will a miracle happen to Kwang Soo?)

1362
00:47:58,862 --> 00:48:00,130
(Splash)

1363
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,302
It was predictable.

1364
00:48:05,869 --> 00:48:06,904
Kwang Soo.

1365
00:48:07,671 --> 00:48:09,339
Of course.

1366
00:48:09,473 --> 00:48:10,974
It was predictable.

1367
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:13,343
- Kwang Soo never succeeds. - It's never wrong.

1368
00:48:13,443 --> 00:48:16,513
(It's okay. Next year might be different.)

1369
00:48:17,881 --> 00:48:19,149
- All right. - Which one is it this time?

1370
00:48:19,149 --> 00:48:21,385
- Su Jin versus Han Na. - Our team leaders.

1371
00:48:21,385 --> 00:48:23,820
- Han Na, let's have crab. - Which one do you think it is?

1372
00:48:23,987 --> 00:48:25,923
- They can't be next to each other. - What?

1373
00:48:25,923 --> 00:48:29,560
(Su Jin looks determined.)

1374
00:48:30,093 --> 00:48:32,462
1, 2, 3.

1375
00:48:34,631 --> 00:48:35,732
Okay!

1376
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,168
What is this? What do I do now?

1377
00:48:38,635 --> 00:48:39,870
Hold on.

1378
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:41,905
This one.

1379
00:48:41,972 --> 00:48:45,108
- Han Na. - Han Na, you can't fail now.

1380
00:48:45,909 --> 00:48:48,278
- I think this one is okay. - Okay.

1381
00:48:48,278 --> 00:48:50,347
- 1, 2, 3. - No.

1382
00:48:51,882 --> 00:48:53,383
(Han Na is sure about the fourth row.)

1383
00:48:53,383 --> 00:48:56,553
(Is her hunch right?)

1384
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:01,325
Yes!

1385
00:49:01,325 --> 00:49:02,359
(Han Na survives.)

1386
00:49:02,993 --> 00:49:04,094
Is it my turn?

1387
00:49:04,094 --> 00:49:05,696
(Unbelievable)

1388
00:49:07,631 --> 00:49:09,533
(Team Red is expected to win.)

1389
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:12,035
(But Team White still has a chance.)

1390
00:49:12,135 --> 00:49:13,737
(I don't know.)

1391
00:49:14,171 --> 00:49:16,173
(With a slight chance, Su Jin jumps for the last time.)

1392
00:49:19,743 --> 00:49:21,878
(Su Jin survives too.)

1393
00:49:22,579 --> 00:49:25,048
(Both team leaders survive.)

1394
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:27,384
What is this?

1395
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:28,418
(What?)

1396
00:49:28,418 --> 00:49:30,520
We're tied!

1397
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,655
(They're back in the game.)

1398
00:49:31,688 --> 00:49:33,290
I can't believe it.

1399
00:49:34,091 --> 00:49:35,425
(The teams are tied again.)

1400
00:49:35,425 --> 00:49:36,426
Is it a tie again?

1401
00:49:36,426 --> 00:49:37,995
- What's going on? - How is this possible?

1402
00:49:37,995 --> 00:49:38,996
Good job.

1403
00:49:38,996 --> 00:49:40,130
Let's do it like this.

1404
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:42,299
1 from each team will do just 1 row.

1405
00:49:42,299 --> 00:49:43,767
- Just one row? - Okay.

1406
00:49:43,767 --> 00:49:44,901
- Who should do it? - Han Na.

1407
00:49:44,901 --> 00:49:46,403
- Han Na? - Han Na.

1408
00:49:46,403 --> 00:49:48,238
Do it. Go.

1409
00:49:48,338 --> 00:49:49,973
- It's... - We shouldn't touch it.

1410
00:49:49,973 --> 00:49:52,209
Don't touch it. It's a 50-50 chance.

1411
00:49:52,909 --> 00:49:53,910
This one.

1412
00:49:54,211 --> 00:49:55,279
This one.

1413
00:49:56,013 --> 00:49:57,481
This one feels right.

1414
00:49:58,215 --> 00:49:59,549
It might be that one.

1415
00:49:59,783 --> 00:50:01,551
Su Jin might have chosen the right one.

1416
00:50:01,551 --> 00:50:03,720
Please jump onto the box on the count of three.

1417
00:50:04,021 --> 00:50:05,422
Will this one be all right?

1418
00:50:05,422 --> 00:50:07,924
- It might not be. - We don't know.

1419
00:50:08,692 --> 00:50:10,160
- Gosh, I'm worried. - One...

1420
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,630
- It might be ice. - 1, 2, 3.

1421
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:20,237
(Who will win the 2nd round?)

1422
00:50:24,074 --> 00:50:26,310
(Team White wins.)

1423
00:50:27,344 --> 00:50:28,779
(Sturdy)

1424
00:50:30,247 --> 00:50:31,548
Yes!

1425
00:50:31,615 --> 00:50:33,784
How is this possible?

1426
00:50:33,784 --> 00:50:36,053
- We were lucky. - Oh, my gosh.

1427
00:50:36,053 --> 00:50:37,387
(Su Jin leads her team to victory again.)

1428
00:50:37,721 --> 00:50:40,090
Gosh, I fell. We won't get any crab.

1429
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:42,259
(Han Na's hunch was wrong. Team Red loses.)

1430
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:47,197
Han Na's team lost.

1431
00:50:47,331 --> 00:50:51,301
Please deposit money in the bank 1 by 1.

1432
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:52,536
The same amount?

1433
00:50:52,736 --> 00:50:53,970
- Let's... - How much are you going to deposit?

1434
00:50:54,271 --> 00:50:56,173
Jae Seok, you should deposit money this time.

1435
00:50:56,473 --> 00:50:59,343
Let's do it like this. To find out who betrayed,

1436
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:02,379
- let's deposit 10 dollars each. - 10 dollars each?

1437
00:51:02,379 --> 00:51:04,181
- We have to win this time. - Last time...

1438
00:51:04,181 --> 00:51:05,382
If we deposit...

1439
00:51:05,382 --> 00:51:07,951
Han Na, you should deposit a lot this time.

1440
00:51:07,951 --> 00:51:09,553
Okay. I'll deposit 30 dollars.

1441
00:51:09,553 --> 00:51:10,620
Okay.

1442
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:11,788
We've agreed, right?

1443
00:51:11,788 --> 00:51:13,423
- I'll go first. - Han Na should go first.

1444
00:51:13,423 --> 00:51:14,691
- Han Na, go first. - Okay.

1445
00:51:14,691 --> 00:51:17,260
- Han Na, start it off. - Don't worry.

1446
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,962
- Do it. Let's go in this order. - I'll do it.

1447
00:51:19,196 --> 00:51:20,464
In the order of the suitcases.

1448
00:51:20,464 --> 00:51:22,632
Hello. I'm here to deposit some money.

1449
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,570
It's time to deposit some money.

1450
00:51:28,905 --> 00:51:30,807
(Han Na promised she'd deposit 30 dollars.)

1451
00:51:30,807 --> 00:51:34,511
(Will she keep her promise?)

1452
00:51:34,611 --> 00:51:36,980
- He was surprised. - What?

1453
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,049
He was surprised at the amount I deposited.

1454
00:51:39,049 --> 00:51:42,886
- You're being suspicious. - It's true.

1455
00:51:42,886 --> 00:51:44,721
He said, "Oh, my."

1456
00:51:44,721 --> 00:51:46,490
Han Na, it didn't take so long.

1457
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:48,425
I took out the money without hesitation.

1458
00:51:48,425 --> 00:51:49,693
- He was surprised. - How?

1459
00:51:49,693 --> 00:51:51,361
Like this.

1460
00:51:51,361 --> 00:51:52,362
(Without hesitation)

1461
00:51:52,362 --> 00:51:53,363
Go.

1462
00:51:53,363 --> 00:51:55,732
As long as we stick to our promise... Keep your words.

1463
00:51:55,732 --> 00:51:57,401
- Kwang Soo. - Otherwise, we'll lose again.

1464
00:51:57,401 --> 00:51:58,468
Go first.

1465
00:51:58,468 --> 00:52:00,570
- You have to deposit some. - You have to.

1466
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:02,172
- We'll be watching you. - Hey.

1467
00:52:02,539 --> 00:52:04,541
- Do it. - Don't put your own interest...

1468
00:52:04,741 --> 00:52:07,944
(What will Jae Seok do?)

1469
00:52:07,944 --> 00:52:09,613
- Hello. - How much did the others deposit?

1470
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:10,781
It's a secret.

1471
00:52:10,781 --> 00:52:12,983
They're misunderstanding me.

1472
00:52:12,983 --> 00:52:14,017
(I did deposit 10 dollars.)

1473
00:52:14,618 --> 00:52:17,921
(Let me see.)

1474
00:52:17,921 --> 00:52:19,189
I won't deposit anything.

1475
00:52:19,189 --> 00:52:21,491
(They're already misunderstanding me.)

1476
00:52:22,826 --> 00:52:24,094
- Okay. - Okay.

1477
00:52:24,194 --> 00:52:26,630
I've been betrayed. I won't deposit anything.

1478
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:27,731
(I have to live.)

1479
00:52:30,967 --> 00:52:32,402
Why did you think so much?

1480
00:52:32,469 --> 00:52:35,071
We agreed on an amount. Why did you think?

1481
00:52:35,071 --> 00:52:37,908
I deposited the amount without hesitation.

1482
00:52:37,974 --> 00:52:39,309
- Did you? - Yes.

1483
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:41,611
(It's the betrayer's turn.)

1484
00:52:41,611 --> 00:52:42,846
Did they deposit money?

1485
00:52:44,714 --> 00:52:45,982
I can't tell you.

1486
00:52:46,783 --> 00:52:49,119
He won't deposit anything. Never.

1487
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,620
Kwang Soo would...

1488
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,156
- have 100 dollars left. - He won't deposit anything.

1489
00:52:53,657 --> 00:52:54,825
- Did you deposit some? - Yes.

1490
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,030
- What? - You didn't, did you?

1491
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:01,231
I did, I swear.

1492
00:53:01,231 --> 00:53:03,033
I can even show you, I promise.

1493
00:53:03,033 --> 00:53:05,135
Gosh. I did.

1494
00:53:05,135 --> 00:53:07,304
- See the result later. - You...

1495
00:53:08,238 --> 00:53:09,573
- Are you sure? - Watch Seok Jin.

1496
00:53:09,973 --> 00:53:14,845
(You have to choose between the team and yourself.)

1497
00:53:17,247 --> 00:53:21,451
(Team Red is done.)

1498
00:53:21,918 --> 00:53:24,221
Now, Su Jin's team can choose...

1499
00:53:24,221 --> 00:53:26,923
a member of the other team and see the amount he or she deposited.

1500
00:53:26,923 --> 00:53:29,960
All right. We'll check the team leader's sense of responsibility.

1501
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,961
Han Na.

1502
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:32,496
See all you want.

1503
00:53:32,496 --> 00:53:34,831
I'm not afraid.

1504
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:36,399
I'm really curious how much Han Na deposited.

1505
00:53:36,399 --> 00:53:38,134
- Right? - The man in the bank...

1506
00:53:38,134 --> 00:53:39,302
was surprised. "This much?"

1507
00:53:39,536 --> 00:53:40,904
How much she deposited...

1508
00:53:40,904 --> 00:53:42,072
All right.

1509
00:53:42,072 --> 00:53:44,674
(Did Han Na deposit 30 dollars as she promised?)

1510
00:53:45,609 --> 00:53:48,011
- This time? - I see.

1511
00:53:48,245 --> 00:53:49,713
- She's shameless. - She's unbelievable.

1512
00:53:49,713 --> 00:53:51,781
- It was predictable. - This is unacceptable.

1513
00:53:51,781 --> 00:53:54,351
With that kind smile on her face,

1514
00:53:54,351 --> 00:53:56,052
- she did this? - They're tricking us.

1515
00:53:56,052 --> 00:53:57,287
Cut it out.

1516
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,922
- I mean... - Did you deposit 30 dollars?

1517
00:53:58,922 --> 00:54:00,657
I can swear on my whole family.

1518
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:01,858
- Really? - Yes.

1519
00:54:01,858 --> 00:54:02,959
I definitely deposited 30 dollars.

1520
00:54:02,959 --> 00:54:04,861
- Her family? - Don't do this.

1521
00:54:04,861 --> 00:54:06,763
(Why would you drag your family in?)

1522
00:54:07,197 --> 00:54:08,298
You don't seem to believe me.

1523
00:54:08,298 --> 00:54:10,200
- 30, 20... - 10.

1524
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,801
- 30, 10, - 30, 10,

1525
00:54:11,801 --> 00:54:12,903
- 20... - I deposited 30 dollars.

1526
00:54:13,169 --> 00:54:14,671
- 30... - How much is it in total?

1527
00:54:14,671 --> 00:54:15,839
- 80. - 50...

1528
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,240
- 80. - 80.

1529
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,408
(The total amount is estimated to be 80 dollars.)

1530
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:20,810
- Guys, come here. - Come here.

1531
00:54:21,344 --> 00:54:24,881
One of us has to deposit at least 30 dollars.

1532
00:54:24,881 --> 00:54:26,483
We have to make a move.

1533
00:54:26,483 --> 00:54:27,551
Who would do that?

1534
00:54:27,551 --> 00:54:28,552
Hurry up.

1535
00:54:29,719 --> 00:54:31,555
So Min, I'm really going to do this.

1536
00:54:31,555 --> 00:54:32,589
(I'm determined.)

1537
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:34,591
(40 dollars?)

1538
00:54:34,591 --> 00:54:36,192
I'm going to do it. I'm not lying.

1539
00:54:36,259 --> 00:54:39,462
I really hope my team will win.

1540
00:54:41,131 --> 00:54:44,801
(Will Haha become a hero?)

1541
00:54:48,405 --> 00:54:51,942
(He rips out bills without hesitation.)

1542
00:54:51,942 --> 00:54:54,411
(Thinking)

1543
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,014
(He really is depositing 40 dollars.)

1544
00:54:58,014 --> 00:54:59,783
What?

1545
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:02,786
Yes. Put them down.

1546
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,421
- Really? - Yes.

1547
00:55:05,088 --> 00:55:06,156
I'm so cool, right?

1548
00:55:06,156 --> 00:55:07,190
(Satisfied)

1549
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:08,191
Yes.

1550
00:55:08,992 --> 00:55:10,093
Give me a kiss on my forehead.

1551
00:55:10,093 --> 00:55:11,194
(Give me a compliment.)

1552
00:55:13,263 --> 00:55:14,331
(Kiss)

1553
00:55:14,331 --> 00:55:15,398
I got a compliment.

1554
00:55:15,398 --> 00:55:16,466
(Happy)

1555
00:55:18,001 --> 00:55:19,069
Are you done?

1556
00:55:19,169 --> 00:55:20,236
Is it my turn?

1557
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:21,304
I did it.

1558
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:24,040
(Thanks to Haha, Team White has an advantage.)

1559
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:28,378
(Will they maintain it to the end?)

1560
00:55:29,012 --> 00:55:32,282
(Team White is done too.)

1561
00:55:32,515 --> 00:55:35,285
All right. Let me announce the result.

1562
00:55:35,285 --> 00:55:36,419
(Result)

1563
00:55:36,419 --> 00:55:37,520
Wait and see.

1564
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,189
Even if they deposited 80 dollars, we might still win.

1565
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:41,191
- It'll be so cool. - The losing team is...

1566
00:55:41,191 --> 00:55:42,826
(Who will win the dilemma game?)

1567
00:55:44,728 --> 00:55:47,497
All right. Let me announce the result.

1568
00:55:47,497 --> 00:55:48,632
(Result)

1569
00:55:48,632 --> 00:55:49,733
Wait and see.

1570
00:55:49,733 --> 00:55:51,401
Even if they deposited 80 dollars, we might still win.

1571
00:55:51,801 --> 00:55:53,403
- It'll be so cool. - The losing team is...

1572
00:55:53,403 --> 00:55:55,038
(Who will win the dilemma game?)

1573
00:55:57,207 --> 00:55:58,241
With 40 dollars...

1574
00:55:58,241 --> 00:56:01,411
(With 40 dollars...)

1575
00:56:01,411 --> 00:56:02,412
The scores are tied.

1576
00:56:02,412 --> 00:56:03,413
- What? - What?

1577
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,281
(Wait, I paid 40 dollars.)

1578
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:06,282
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1579
00:56:07,017 --> 00:56:08,852
- That's terrible. - How could they?

1580
00:56:08,852 --> 00:56:11,287
- My goodness. - It's obvious who didn't pay.

1581
00:56:11,287 --> 00:56:12,656
- Listen. - Wasn't I right?

1582
00:56:12,656 --> 00:56:14,791
- I was right. - What happened?

1583
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:16,159
I paid 10 dollars.

1584
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:18,061
- You're terrible. - I paid this much.

1585
00:56:18,061 --> 00:56:19,496
I swear that I paid.

1586
00:56:19,496 --> 00:56:21,131
- How could you do this? - Who was it?

1587
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:22,599
How could you?

1588
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:24,768
- I really paid. - You're terrible.

1589
00:56:24,768 --> 00:56:25,869
- I'm serious. - How could you?

1590
00:56:25,869 --> 00:56:27,137
- Let me ask you. - Seriously?

1591
00:56:27,137 --> 00:56:28,772
- I promise that I paid. - I definitely paid.

1592
00:56:28,772 --> 00:56:30,073
I paid too.

1593
00:56:30,573 --> 00:56:31,841
You punks.

1594
00:56:31,841 --> 00:56:32,909
The three didn't pay.

1595
00:56:32,909 --> 00:56:34,511
- If you paid 30 dollars... - What about him?

1596
00:56:34,511 --> 00:56:35,912
- I paid this much. - I paid 10 dollars.

1597
00:56:35,912 --> 00:56:37,447
Stop it, Haha.

1598
00:56:37,447 --> 00:56:38,682
You didn't pay.

1599
00:56:38,682 --> 00:56:40,083
- I paid 10. - You didn't.

1600
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:41,284
- I did. - You didn't pay.

1601
00:56:41,284 --> 00:56:42,886
If you paid 10 dollars,

1602
00:56:42,886 --> 00:56:45,121
I'll come to your house every morning.

1603
00:56:45,155 --> 00:56:46,956
I'll clean the house and do your laundry.

1604
00:56:47,157 --> 00:56:49,826
I'll fold your siblings' underwear.

1605
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:50,994
That's enough, Haha.

1606
00:56:51,494 --> 00:56:54,197
- All right, let's go eat. - This is so unfair.

1607
00:56:54,197 --> 00:56:55,732
It's time to eat.

1608
00:56:55,732 --> 00:56:59,035
None of you paid.

1609
00:56:59,369 --> 00:57:00,670
- Right? - No.

1610
00:57:01,805 --> 00:57:04,741
Gosh, look at the food.

1611
00:57:04,741 --> 00:57:06,576
- It looks delicious. - It looks amazing.

1612
00:57:06,576 --> 00:57:07,610
I'm so hungry.

1613
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:10,580
(Team White wins a feast of snow crab.)

1614
00:57:11,081 --> 00:57:13,883
(It includes soft white crab meat...)

1615
00:57:13,883 --> 00:57:16,786
(and savory crab fried rice.)

1616
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,422
Didn't we eat that before?

1617
00:57:19,422 --> 00:57:21,224
It's the same dried laver.

1618
00:57:21,224 --> 00:57:22,225
- Dried laver? - Yes.

1619
00:57:22,225 --> 00:57:23,993
(The losing team gets rice with dried laver.)

1620
00:57:25,061 --> 00:57:27,597
- Gosh. - This is so upsetting.

1621
00:57:27,731 --> 00:57:29,733
It's upsetting that we get so little food,

1622
00:57:29,733 --> 00:57:32,602
but their lies make me more upset.

1623
00:57:32,602 --> 00:57:34,471
I don't need to eat.

1624
00:57:35,038 --> 00:57:36,539
Please change the members on my team.

1625
00:57:36,539 --> 00:57:38,441
- Seriously. - What did you say?

1626
00:57:38,942 --> 00:57:40,910
We lost because of you.

1627
00:57:40,977 --> 00:57:43,012
- What did I do? - Stop it.

1628
00:57:43,613 --> 00:57:45,515
- I don't believe Han Na. - Forget it.

1629
00:57:45,515 --> 00:57:48,551
Thank you for the food.

1630
00:57:49,686 --> 00:57:51,154
Is this real?

1631
00:57:51,554 --> 00:57:53,289
- Gosh. - Thanks for the food.

1632
00:57:53,289 --> 00:57:56,726
(As soon as they take a bite,)

1633
00:57:56,826 --> 00:57:57,927
(they can't stop being impressed.)

1634
00:57:57,927 --> 00:57:58,928
It's delicious.

1635
00:58:00,363 --> 00:58:01,498
Dip it in the sauce.

1636
00:58:02,031 --> 00:58:03,933
By the way,

1637
00:58:03,933 --> 00:58:05,802
they can't finish that much food.

1638
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:08,471
Isn't it delicious?

1639
00:58:09,472 --> 00:58:11,574
That looks so delicious.

1640
00:58:11,574 --> 00:58:14,744
I'll give you a bite because it's too delicious.

1641
00:58:14,744 --> 00:58:16,179
(He takes a spoon of crab fried rice.)

1642
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,583
(It's a mixture of crab meat and savory intestines.)

1643
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:25,121
(It's the amazing crab fried rice.)

1644
00:58:26,156 --> 00:58:27,791
I want to give them a bite.

1645
00:58:28,091 --> 00:58:29,225
(They get up suddenly.)

1646
00:58:30,293 --> 00:58:31,461
(I want a bite.)

1647
00:58:31,461 --> 00:58:33,096
- Give them a bite. - Have some.

1648
00:58:33,096 --> 00:58:34,197
Give them some.

1649
00:58:34,597 --> 00:58:36,766
- That was quick. - Her mouth is too big.

1650
00:58:37,133 --> 00:58:39,502
- Gosh, she took such a big bite. - It's really good.

1651
00:58:39,502 --> 00:58:40,904
(She applauds at the taste.)

1652
00:58:41,304 --> 00:58:43,072
- Here you go. - It's so delicious.

1653
00:58:43,373 --> 00:58:45,642
- He gives it to everyone. - Does he?

1654
00:58:45,742 --> 00:58:47,243
It's so delicious.

1655
00:58:47,243 --> 00:58:48,444
Tasting is over.

1656
00:58:48,444 --> 00:58:50,580
(Tasting is over now.)

1657
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:51,614
(My goodness)

1658
00:58:51,614 --> 00:58:52,882
I'm sorry, but it's over.

1659
00:58:52,882 --> 00:58:54,017
That's so annoying.

1660
00:58:54,017 --> 00:58:55,885
Couldn't you tell us how much you were giving?

1661
00:58:55,885 --> 00:58:58,221
- That's annoying. - I meant to give two spoonfuls.

1662
00:58:58,288 --> 00:59:00,557
I'll give three spoonfuls later.

1663
00:59:00,557 --> 00:59:02,725
(He offers to give three spoonfuls later.)

1664
00:59:02,725 --> 00:59:05,061
- It must be fun to wait. - That's right.

1665
00:59:05,361 --> 00:59:07,764
It must be fun to wait.

1666
00:59:08,231 --> 00:59:12,702
(Those who wait will get fried rice.)

1667
00:59:13,636 --> 00:59:14,671
Are you waiting for a bite?

1668
00:59:14,671 --> 00:59:15,672
(What are you doing?)

1669
00:59:15,672 --> 00:59:17,574
I heard the market will open soon.

1670
00:59:18,575 --> 00:59:19,576
That's funny.

1671
00:59:21,344 --> 00:59:22,979
- The market is open. - Yes, sir.

1672
00:59:23,012 --> 00:59:24,080
Thank you.

1673
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,348
Don't give it for free.

1674
00:59:25,348 --> 00:59:26,583
(He gives sushi this time.)

1675
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:28,284
- Try some. - It's delicious.

1676
00:59:29,118 --> 00:59:30,119
I saw it.

1677
00:59:32,021 --> 00:59:33,022
I saw it.

1678
00:59:33,022 --> 00:59:34,324
(It tastes so strong.)

1679
00:59:34,324 --> 00:59:36,292
I put a lot of wasabi on it.

1680
00:59:36,292 --> 00:59:37,393
- Really? - Yes.

1681
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,863
I'm sure it was an edible amount.

1682
00:59:39,863 --> 00:59:41,030
- Of course. - Sure.

1683
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:43,366
I don't think so.

1684
00:59:43,933 --> 00:59:45,301
I have one bite.

1685
00:59:45,301 --> 00:59:47,103
- 1st come, 1st serve. - I'm coming.

1686
00:59:47,403 --> 00:59:49,405
(I'll eat it.)

1687
00:59:49,806 --> 00:59:50,840
Okay.

1688
00:59:53,409 --> 00:59:54,410
What are they doing?

1689
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:56,479
How did he eat that?

1690
00:59:56,512 --> 00:59:58,481
She gave him all the sauce.

1691
00:59:59,182 --> 01:00:00,183
Really?

1692
01:00:00,583 --> 01:00:01,684
(It's a combination of green and red sauce.)

1693
01:00:01,684 --> 01:00:03,386
- My goodness. - That's impressive.

1694
01:00:03,386 --> 01:00:05,455
- Come on, So Min. - Goodness.

1695
01:00:05,555 --> 01:00:06,656
That's impressive.

1696
01:00:06,656 --> 01:00:08,391
Why did you eat it?

1697
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:10,727
Let's play Game of Wits.

1698
01:00:10,727 --> 01:00:12,095
(They start Game of Wits.)

1699
01:00:12,095 --> 01:00:13,096
One.

1700
01:00:13,563 --> 01:00:14,530
- 2. - 3.

1701
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:17,433
- Four. - Come, Jae Seok.

1702
01:00:17,533 --> 01:00:18,935
- It's Jae Seok. - Jae Seok.

1703
01:00:18,935 --> 01:00:20,803
What? He didn't even play.

1704
01:00:20,803 --> 01:00:22,572
He wasn't paying attention.

1705
01:00:22,572 --> 01:00:23,706
Is it given if you don't play?

1706
01:00:23,706 --> 01:00:25,475
- What? - It means that he was quick.

1707
01:00:25,475 --> 01:00:26,843
It was the person who stays still.

1708
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:29,312
- He did a good job. - He's quick.

1709
01:00:29,612 --> 01:00:30,613
He's good.

1710
01:00:30,613 --> 01:00:32,515
1st come, 1st serve.

1711
01:00:32,515 --> 01:00:33,883
(Haha offers food.)

1712
01:00:33,883 --> 01:00:34,884
I never did this.

1713
01:00:34,884 --> 01:00:38,288
(He's determined to eat well this time.)

1714
01:00:39,389 --> 01:00:43,293
He must like ginger a lot.

1715
01:00:44,093 --> 01:00:46,763
(He gets a spoonful of ginger.)

1716
01:00:48,197 --> 01:00:49,432
He must like it.

1717
01:00:49,632 --> 01:00:51,935
Goodness, Kwang Soo.

1718
01:00:51,935 --> 01:00:53,770
It's because you're being too easy.

1719
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:55,471
It's delicious.

1720
01:00:55,471 --> 01:00:56,973
I'll have diarrhea tonight.

1721
01:00:56,973 --> 01:00:58,308
(He's sure of having diarrhea.)

1722
01:01:01,611 --> 01:01:02,712
There's something here.

1723
01:01:02,712 --> 01:01:04,380
It's a cultural center.

1724
01:01:04,881 --> 01:01:07,684
Here's your last chance to win the Chance Card.

1725
01:01:07,684 --> 01:01:10,019
The mission is called Random Shoe Space.

1726
01:01:10,019 --> 01:01:11,220
(Random Shoe Space)

1727
01:01:11,721 --> 01:01:14,824
Obtain the opponent's name tag, and fill in...

1728
01:01:14,824 --> 01:01:17,760
any of the 20 empty shoe spaces.

1729
01:01:18,094 --> 01:01:21,097
Once you steal a shoe of the opposing team member,

1730
01:01:21,097 --> 01:01:23,032
you obtain the person's name tag.

1731
01:01:23,499 --> 01:01:26,035
You may stick the name tag...

1732
01:01:26,035 --> 01:01:29,372
on any of the empty spaces on the name board.

1733
01:01:29,806 --> 01:01:31,040
Before the race,

1734
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,142
each team will receive reflection cards.

1735
01:01:33,409 --> 01:01:36,612
You may discuss in whose shoes you'll put the reflection cards.

1736
01:01:36,612 --> 01:01:39,782
Last scenes are set up in various parts of the building.

1737
01:01:39,782 --> 01:01:42,051
Find a small shoe in a box.

1738
01:01:42,151 --> 01:01:44,320
If you hit a member of the opposing team with the shoe,

1739
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,423
- you obtain his name tag again. - That sounds fun.

1740
01:01:47,423 --> 01:01:48,992
Can you hit any part of the body?

1741
01:01:48,992 --> 01:01:50,994
Yes, it's the same as dodgeball.

1742
01:01:51,361 --> 01:01:54,430
Each team will take its place.

1743
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:55,631
- Okay. - Let's go.

1744
01:01:55,631 --> 01:01:59,402
(Which color will the name board be filled with?)

1745
01:02:01,704 --> 01:02:04,574
If there's someone who only speaks the truth...

1746
01:02:04,574 --> 01:02:06,142
(Let's have an honest talk.)

1747
01:02:06,142 --> 01:02:07,710
- Tell us. - It makes no sense.

1748
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:09,612
Tell us honestly since there's no camera.

1749
01:02:10,179 --> 01:02:12,181
- There are no cameras? - There aren't any.

1750
01:02:12,482 --> 01:02:13,616
No one else is here.

1751
01:02:13,616 --> 01:02:15,752
- It's only the five of us. - No way.

1752
01:02:15,752 --> 01:02:17,220
There are no cameras.

1753
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:19,522
- This is real. - Tell us what you want to say.

1754
01:02:19,522 --> 01:02:21,724
Someone might hear us,

1755
01:02:21,724 --> 01:02:23,192
so I'll make a gesture.

1756
01:02:24,093 --> 01:02:25,261
(Please trust the 4 of us.)

1757
01:02:25,261 --> 01:02:26,562
Whom are you talking to?

1758
01:02:26,863 --> 01:02:29,198
I want everyone to see it. During Round Two...

1759
01:02:29,198 --> 01:02:30,199
(I paid 40 dollars.)

1760
01:02:31,134 --> 01:02:32,201
You paid 40 dollars?

1761
01:02:32,201 --> 01:02:33,636
(Believe me too.)

1762
01:02:33,636 --> 01:02:35,705
(The members become habitual liars.)

1763
01:02:35,705 --> 01:02:37,407
I believe you since there's no camera.

1764
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:40,143
Show us how much you paid since there's no camera.

1765
01:02:40,143 --> 01:02:41,210
Right.

1766
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:44,881
(They continue to lie.)

1767
01:02:46,282 --> 01:02:47,350
(Will they work well as a team?)

1768
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:49,052
- Goodness. - There's no camera.

1769
01:02:49,052 --> 01:02:50,753
Why do you keep lying?

1770
01:02:50,753 --> 01:02:52,522
(Will they work well as a team?)

1771
01:02:52,822 --> 01:02:54,290
We should use the reflection card wisely.

1772
01:02:54,290 --> 01:02:56,092
- The easy target... - You should keep it.

1773
01:02:56,092 --> 01:02:58,261
should keep it in his shoe.

1774
01:02:58,261 --> 01:02:59,729
- Do you want it? - He should keep it.

1775
01:02:59,996 --> 01:03:02,598
(Between Kwang Soo and Jae Seok, who will keep the reflection card?)

1776
01:03:02,598 --> 01:03:06,135
Do we have to take off the shoe that has the reflection card?

1777
01:03:06,135 --> 01:03:08,304
If we take off the other shoe,

1778
01:03:08,304 --> 01:03:10,206
- it doesn't count. - I see.

1779
01:03:10,206 --> 01:03:11,441
Which shoe you put it in is important.

1780
01:03:11,441 --> 01:03:13,076
The reflection card is effective only once.

1781
01:03:13,076 --> 01:03:15,011
It can be used only once.

1782
01:03:16,112 --> 01:03:18,281
An easy target should keep it.

1783
01:03:18,281 --> 01:03:20,650
- I'll keep it. - I'm an easy target.

1784
01:03:20,683 --> 01:03:22,685
People will expect you to have it.

1785
01:03:22,685 --> 01:03:24,053
(Between So Min and Haha, who will keep it?)

1786
01:03:25,455 --> 01:03:28,391
Let's start the race.

1787
01:03:28,391 --> 01:03:29,826
- Let's do well. - Seriously.

1788
01:03:29,826 --> 01:03:31,094
- 10. - Let's win this time.

1789
01:03:31,094 --> 01:03:32,762
- We should win. - We kept losing.

1790
01:03:32,762 --> 01:03:34,430
- Let's win. - Also,

1791
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:36,532
- let's pay. - Let me make it clear.

1792
01:03:36,532 --> 01:03:38,201
- Seven. - I have no greed.

1793
01:03:38,801 --> 01:03:41,404
- Six. - I'll give all my money.

1794
01:03:41,404 --> 01:03:43,306
- We don't need to win. - I'll give it all.

1795
01:03:43,306 --> 01:03:45,641
You should pay before saying anything.

1796
01:03:45,641 --> 01:03:46,742
- It's because... - Four.

1797
01:03:46,742 --> 01:03:47,810
In 1, 2, 3.

1798
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:48,811
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1799
01:03:49,212 --> 01:03:51,380
- Two. - We can do it.

1800
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:52,882
One. The race starts.

1801
01:03:53,182 --> 01:03:54,283
(The race starts.)

1802
01:03:54,283 --> 01:03:55,284
- Go. - Go.

1803
01:03:55,284 --> 01:03:57,320
(The race starts.)

1804
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:01,390
We should find something first.

1805
01:04:02,091 --> 01:04:03,726
Is that a box?

1806
01:04:03,726 --> 01:04:06,095
(Did Kwang Soo find a box?)

1807
01:04:07,163 --> 01:04:08,598
- Is there a shoe? - No.

1808
01:04:09,832 --> 01:04:11,701
- It's where you take photos. - It's a photo zone.

1809
01:04:11,701 --> 01:04:13,136
- Like this. - I thought they were shoes.

1810
01:04:13,136 --> 01:04:14,470
It's a photo zone.

1811
01:04:14,804 --> 01:04:16,472
Is there anything?

1812
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:18,341
I'll go this way, So Min.

1813
01:04:18,841 --> 01:04:19,909
What's this?

1814
01:04:20,243 --> 01:04:21,344
"Kwang Soo is a fool."

1815
01:04:21,344 --> 01:04:23,346
(What is this?)

1816
01:04:24,313 --> 01:04:27,183
(It's so amazing.)

1817
01:04:27,183 --> 01:04:28,184
It was printed.

1818
01:04:28,784 --> 01:04:29,886
It says "Kwang Soo is a fool."

1819
01:04:29,886 --> 01:04:32,555
(What is she doing in the middle of a race?)

1820
01:04:33,322 --> 01:04:34,490
It's so cool.

1821
01:04:35,591 --> 01:04:37,293
- Se Chan. - Yes?

1822
01:04:37,293 --> 01:04:38,327
Where are you?

1823
01:04:39,362 --> 01:04:41,264
She's so needy from the start.

1824
01:04:42,031 --> 01:04:43,533
Look. This is cool.

1825
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,034
What?

1826
01:04:46,135 --> 01:04:48,204
(Reflection card)

1827
01:04:48,538 --> 01:04:50,306
I made a reflection card.

1828
01:04:50,306 --> 01:04:51,340
Really?

1829
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:54,443
(Her ability to deceive is advanced.)

1830
01:04:54,443 --> 01:04:55,478
I made it.

1831
01:05:00,283 --> 01:05:01,751
I must find the shoes.

1832
01:05:02,118 --> 01:05:03,519
Where could they be?

1833
01:05:03,686 --> 01:05:05,454
Jong Kook, I think it's here.

1834
01:05:08,925 --> 01:05:10,826
(Team Red finds Haha alone.)

1835
01:05:10,826 --> 01:05:12,361
It's Haha.

1836
01:05:12,461 --> 01:05:14,363
Let's get him. Keep watching.

1837
01:05:14,363 --> 01:05:15,498
Let's go.

1838
01:05:17,533 --> 01:05:18,634
Jong Kook.

1839
01:05:19,435 --> 01:05:20,536
Where's Jong Kook?

1840
01:05:20,536 --> 01:05:22,038
(Hello, Haha.)

1841
01:05:22,038 --> 01:05:24,173
Come on, hurry.

1842
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:27,977
(Ji Hyo approaches him stealthily.)

1843
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:29,111
Hurry.

1844
01:05:29,111 --> 01:05:32,682
(You're mine, Haha.)

1845
01:05:33,849 --> 01:05:36,452
(It's our chance to get him.)

1846
01:05:42,725 --> 01:05:45,861
(Haha reaches a dead end.)

1847
01:05:45,861 --> 01:05:48,097
I think Jong Kook's coming.

1848
01:05:48,097 --> 01:05:50,132
It's now. Close the door, Jong Kook.

1849
01:05:50,366 --> 01:05:51,934
Wait. Be careful.

1850
01:05:52,134 --> 01:05:53,202
Be careful.

1851
01:05:53,402 --> 01:05:54,570
If he uses a reflection card, it's over.

1852
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:56,205
- It'll be over. - No.

1853
01:05:56,305 --> 01:05:57,473
You can't.

1854
01:05:57,473 --> 01:05:59,308
(They need to finish before Jong Kook gets here.)

1855
01:05:59,308 --> 01:06:00,409
You can't.

1856
01:06:00,409 --> 01:06:02,745
Hold on. I don't think he's trying on purpose.

1857
01:06:02,745 --> 01:06:03,846
(She slips a shoe off.)

1858
01:06:03,846 --> 01:06:10,186
(Does Haha's shoe have a reflection card?)

1859
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,421
- It's a reflection card. - Right? I knew it.

1860
01:06:12,421 --> 01:06:13,723
(It's what they thought.)

1861
01:06:14,724 --> 01:06:15,992
- Let's see. - See you later.

1862
01:06:16,392 --> 01:06:18,160
- Please go ahead, Haha. - All right.

1863
01:06:18,494 --> 01:06:20,997
Thank you.

1864
01:06:20,997 --> 01:06:21,998
I told you.

1865
01:06:22,131 --> 01:06:24,400
It looked like he wasn't trying on purpose.

1866
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,303
(He exits with a deep sense of satisfaction.)

1867
01:06:28,037 --> 01:06:30,973
An easy target should keep it.

1868
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,408
I'm an easy target.

1869
01:06:32,541 --> 01:06:34,477
People will expect you to have it.

1870
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:36,178
Me. I'll be fine.

1871
01:06:36,979 --> 01:06:38,180
Inside? I see.

1872
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,249
(Haha volunteered because it's not as predictable.)

1873
01:06:40,249 --> 01:06:41,284
I'll do it.

1874
01:06:41,851 --> 01:06:43,052
I told you.

1875
01:06:43,152 --> 01:06:44,820
It looked like he wasn't trying on purpose.

1876
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:46,555
- It was a bait. - No.

1877
01:06:46,656 --> 01:06:47,657
Now,

1878
01:06:47,657 --> 01:06:49,558
they don't have it anymore.

1879
01:06:49,592 --> 01:06:50,726
That's good.

1880
01:06:50,726 --> 01:06:52,194
We would have gotten the reflection card at one point.

1881
01:06:52,194 --> 01:06:53,596
It's gone now.

1882
01:06:55,598 --> 01:06:57,533
(4th floor auditorium where the name board is)

1883
01:06:57,533 --> 01:06:58,601
Hello.

1884
01:06:59,001 --> 01:07:04,173
(The first sticker goes to Han Na.)

1885
01:07:04,173 --> 01:07:07,176
(Su Jin is going around by herself.)

1886
01:07:08,311 --> 01:07:10,313
Ji Hyo, where are you...

1887
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:11,981
What are you doing?

1888
01:07:12,181 --> 01:07:14,483
(I'm here to catch you.)

1889
01:07:14,483 --> 01:07:15,551
No way.

1890
01:07:15,551 --> 01:07:17,653
(She's everywhere today.)

1891
01:07:17,653 --> 01:07:19,322
(Help me.)

1892
01:07:19,322 --> 01:07:20,523
Help me!

1893
01:07:21,123 --> 01:07:22,325
Help me!

1894
01:07:22,325 --> 01:07:24,660
(We'll help Ji Hyo.)

1895
01:07:25,094 --> 01:07:26,462
It's Su Jin.

1896
01:07:26,762 --> 01:07:27,830
Get her.

1897
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:29,265
(They don't have a reflection card anymore.)

1898
01:07:30,366 --> 01:07:31,701
(Su Jin is out, and they get her name tag.)

1899
01:07:31,701 --> 01:07:34,203
There's nothing. I don't have anything.

1900
01:07:36,472 --> 01:07:39,542
(We can't give the center spot away.)

1901
01:07:41,344 --> 01:07:42,511
Let's get them.

1902
01:07:42,511 --> 01:07:43,713
(Team Red is unstoppable.)

1903
01:07:43,713 --> 01:07:44,780
Get them.

1904
01:07:45,014 --> 01:07:46,749
Hold on.

1905
01:07:46,749 --> 01:07:48,150
We were going up.

1906
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:49,652
Go the other way.

1907
01:07:49,652 --> 01:07:51,320
Hold on.

1908
01:07:51,387 --> 01:07:52,888
What do you mean?

1909
01:07:53,222 --> 01:07:54,290
- Grab him. - No.

1910
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:55,491
Se Chan!

1911
01:07:55,658 --> 01:07:56,826
I have a reflection card.

1912
01:07:57,293 --> 01:07:58,361
It's a reflection card.

1913
01:07:58,928 --> 01:08:00,096
(It's a fake one.)

1914
01:08:00,096 --> 01:08:01,097
It's fake.

1915
01:08:01,764 --> 01:08:04,133
(She is cheating all day.)

1916
01:08:04,133 --> 01:08:06,202
It's a reflection card.

1917
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:09,805
Go up. Let's go up first.

1918
01:08:10,039 --> 01:08:11,474
Let's go up.

1919
01:08:11,574 --> 01:08:13,309
Let go.

1920
01:08:13,409 --> 01:08:14,944
No, he's faking it.

1921
01:08:14,944 --> 01:08:17,380
(No, he's faking it.)

1922
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:18,681
- Let go. - This one.

1923
01:08:18,681 --> 01:08:21,384
(Does Jae Seok have a reflection card as well?)

1924
01:08:22,385 --> 01:08:23,452
It's a reflection card.

1925
01:08:23,886 --> 01:08:26,389
(He does.)

1926
01:08:26,389 --> 01:08:27,656
It's a reflection card.

1927
01:08:28,224 --> 01:08:29,558
(I tricked you all.)

1928
01:08:29,558 --> 01:08:30,659
Okay.

1929
01:08:31,227 --> 01:08:32,328
So Min.

1930
01:08:32,328 --> 01:08:35,364
(That was a waste of energy.)

1931
01:08:35,664 --> 01:08:37,032
(He looks around.)

1932
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,968
Shoes? Small shoes?

1933
01:08:38,968 --> 01:08:42,338
(Where are the small shoes?)

1934
01:08:46,542 --> 01:08:48,310
My gosh.

1935
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:49,745
(He finds the Lost Shoe he can use to eliminate people.)

1936
01:08:49,745 --> 01:08:50,880
My gosh.

1937
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,548
(He finds the Lost Shoe he can use to eliminate people.)

1938
01:08:52,982 --> 01:08:54,150
I'll put it in my pocket.

1939
01:08:54,150 --> 01:08:55,551
(He feels confident now.)

1940
01:08:55,551 --> 01:08:56,652
I can see them.

1941
01:08:57,353 --> 01:09:00,022
(You're all dead.)

1942
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:02,591
They used their reflection card.

1943
01:09:02,825 --> 01:09:03,826
Let's go.

1944
01:09:03,826 --> 01:09:05,361
(Let's go and fight.)

1945
01:09:05,361 --> 01:09:07,129
They're coming. What should we do, Se Chan?

1946
01:09:07,563 --> 01:09:08,631
What should we do?

1947
01:09:08,964 --> 01:09:11,534
(I'm scared.)

1948
01:09:12,301 --> 01:09:15,905
(Seok Jin leads his team with the Lost Shoe.)

1949
01:09:15,905 --> 01:09:18,240
(Jong Kook approaches quietly...)

1950
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,443
(to help Se Chan who's alone.)

1951
01:09:20,643 --> 01:09:21,811
It's Jong Kook.

1952
01:09:21,811 --> 01:09:22,912
(Be careful.)

1953
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,048
It had begun.

1954
01:09:26,048 --> 01:09:30,586
(He attacks Jae Seok who already used his reflection card.)

1955
01:09:32,288 --> 01:09:34,623
(If you throw the Lost Shoe and hit somebody,)

1956
01:09:34,623 --> 01:09:37,193
(you get their name tag.)

1957
01:09:37,326 --> 01:09:38,694
It's the same rule as dodgeball.

1958
01:09:39,495 --> 01:09:40,629
Now, Jong Kook.

1959
01:09:40,629 --> 01:09:42,698
(It's time to throw the Lost Shoe.)

1960
01:09:42,698 --> 01:09:43,866
Shoe.

1961
01:09:43,866 --> 01:09:46,869
(It's time to throw the Lost Shoe.)

1962
01:09:48,204 --> 01:09:51,407
(He threw it.)

1963
01:09:52,908 --> 01:09:55,578
(What?)

1964
01:09:55,611 --> 01:09:56,812
He caught it.

1965
01:09:56,946 --> 01:09:57,980
I got it.

1966
01:09:58,481 --> 01:09:59,782
What?

1967
01:09:59,949 --> 01:10:01,050
I got you.

1968
01:10:01,116 --> 01:10:02,151
He's out.

1969
01:10:02,151 --> 01:10:04,353
(He caught the shoe and threw it at Jae Seok.)

1970
01:10:04,353 --> 01:10:05,521
How did you catch that?

1971
01:10:05,955 --> 01:10:07,923
- How did you catch that? - Hold on.

1972
01:10:08,824 --> 01:10:10,159
Why did you let him catch it?

1973
01:10:10,259 --> 01:10:12,361
No, he wasn't supposed to catch it.

1974
01:10:12,795 --> 01:10:15,030
You wasted it.

1975
01:10:17,666 --> 01:10:19,702
My goodness.

1976
01:10:19,702 --> 01:10:21,036
He's so skilled.

1977
01:10:21,036 --> 01:10:22,338
Seok Jin, you're more skilled than him.

1978
01:10:22,338 --> 01:10:24,206
- You're the skilled one. - No.

1979
01:10:24,206 --> 01:10:25,374
You're the truly skilled one.

1980
01:10:25,374 --> 01:10:26,909
That made me so mad.

1981
01:10:26,909 --> 01:10:28,377
Seok Jin is a joke.

1982
01:10:28,377 --> 01:10:30,746
I was going to use it earlier but saved it.

1983
01:10:30,746 --> 01:10:32,481
I saved it for later.

1984
01:10:33,115 --> 01:10:34,283
Where are you going?

1985
01:10:34,483 --> 01:10:35,484
- What? - Where are you going?

1986
01:10:35,484 --> 01:10:36,952
It's dangerous to be alone.

1987
01:10:38,821 --> 01:10:40,923
- I want to blend in. - My gosh, Seok Jin.

1988
01:10:40,923 --> 01:10:42,691
(Can you send him to the other team?)

1989
01:10:43,692 --> 01:10:46,495
(The teams are tied 3 to 3.)

1990
01:10:46,562 --> 01:10:49,031
Isn't it more beneficial for us to attack him?

1991
01:10:49,164 --> 01:10:50,366
- Haha. - He has a shoe.

1992
01:10:50,366 --> 01:10:51,901
- You hid a shoe, right? - He has a shoe.

1993
01:10:51,901 --> 01:10:53,035
- You have a small shoe, right? - It's a shoe.

1994
01:10:53,035 --> 01:10:54,403
I think he has it.

1995
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:56,105
We can catch it.

1996
01:10:56,272 --> 01:10:57,506
The small shoe?

1997
01:10:58,641 --> 01:11:02,811
(Haha looks for a chance and runs at them.)

1998
01:11:03,913 --> 01:11:08,350
Catch him. It's a fake shoe.

1999
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:09,952
(It's a big shoe.)

2000
01:11:10,052 --> 01:11:12,021
- Catch him. - It's fake.

2001
01:11:12,621 --> 01:11:14,290
We got you.

2002
01:11:16,258 --> 01:11:18,327
Let go. It's the scriptwriter's shoe.

2003
01:11:18,694 --> 01:11:21,564
It's the scriptwriter's. It's her shoe.

2004
01:11:22,364 --> 01:11:24,400
I knew it. That scared me.

2005
01:11:25,401 --> 01:11:26,735
It was fake.

2006
01:11:26,735 --> 01:11:28,571
- His shoe was this big. - It was too big...

2007
01:11:28,571 --> 01:11:29,838
to be a small shoe.

2008
01:11:29,838 --> 01:11:30,839
Wasn't that so smart?

2009
01:11:31,273 --> 01:11:33,142
- No! - It was her shoe.

2010
01:11:35,077 --> 01:11:36,612
(So Min accidentally drops by.)

2011
01:11:36,812 --> 01:11:37,980
Catch her.

2012
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:39,081
Help me.

2013
01:11:39,081 --> 01:11:40,716
- Help me, Se Chan! - Get her.

2014
01:11:40,783 --> 01:11:42,117
- Help me. - Catch her.

2015
01:11:42,117 --> 01:11:43,719
Please, Se Chan.

2016
01:11:43,719 --> 01:11:45,621
Catch her. Rip it.

2017
01:11:45,621 --> 01:11:46,956
Don't do that.

2018
01:11:46,956 --> 01:11:49,158
- Catch her. - Don't do that.

2019
01:11:49,692 --> 01:11:52,328
(When something happens to...)

2020
01:11:52,328 --> 01:11:54,196
(my team member...)

2021
01:11:54,229 --> 01:11:55,998
Don't get close.

2022
01:11:56,332 --> 01:11:58,033
(Here comes the problem-solver.)

2023
01:11:58,033 --> 01:11:59,234
Don't!

2024
01:11:59,535 --> 01:12:03,105
(He shows up quietly and turns the situation around.)

2025
01:12:03,105 --> 01:12:04,173
Don't!

2026
01:12:04,373 --> 01:12:05,708
- He got Han Na's shoe. - It's Han Na's.

2027
01:12:06,342 --> 01:12:07,443
Han Na.

2028
01:12:07,643 --> 01:12:08,611
He's here.

2029
01:12:09,144 --> 01:12:11,013
What's wrong with you?

2030
01:12:11,013 --> 01:12:12,381
(You tried to get me out?)

2031
01:12:12,381 --> 01:12:14,049
- You're so mean. - What?

2032
01:12:14,216 --> 01:12:15,551
How am I mean?

2033
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,823
(The race is halfway done.)

2034
01:12:21,824 --> 01:12:22,891
Out.

2035
01:12:22,891 --> 01:12:24,593
(The name board fills up after fierce battles.)

2036
01:12:24,593 --> 01:12:25,861
- I'm coming. - Out!

2037
01:12:26,562 --> 01:12:27,663
Watch out.

2038
01:12:27,763 --> 01:12:29,231
- No, no. - Out.

2039
01:12:29,431 --> 01:12:31,033
You're out.

2040
01:12:31,433 --> 01:12:33,535
- You first? - Here. You're out.

2041
01:12:35,037 --> 01:12:36,672
There's one space left.

2042
01:12:37,239 --> 01:12:39,141
I wish I found one shoe.

2043
01:12:40,042 --> 01:12:41,210
Let's go down using the stairs.

2044
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:43,078
(There's one space left. It's pure war.)

2045
01:12:43,145 --> 01:12:44,713
- There was nothing upstairs. - Right?

2046
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:46,081
Is it downstairs?

2047
01:12:47,282 --> 01:12:49,852
(Where's Team Red?)

2048
01:12:54,423 --> 01:12:55,491
- Hey! - You scared me.

2049
01:12:55,491 --> 01:12:57,826
(You scared me.)

2050
01:12:57,826 --> 01:12:58,894
Hurry.

2051
01:12:58,894 --> 01:13:00,195
(Block them.)

2052
01:13:00,329 --> 01:13:01,463
Everybody, come here.

2053
01:13:03,565 --> 01:13:04,967
- There are too many of them. - If we...

2054
01:13:04,967 --> 01:13:06,535
- There are many of them? - have to fight here...

2055
01:13:06,602 --> 01:13:08,203
There are too many of them.

2056
01:13:08,270 --> 01:13:09,505
I think it's better to back off.

2057
01:13:09,872 --> 01:13:11,774
What if we fight in this small space then?

2058
01:13:15,411 --> 01:13:16,712
They're here.

2059
01:13:16,745 --> 01:13:17,946
They're all here.

2060
01:13:18,914 --> 01:13:20,182
Come out.

2061
01:13:20,182 --> 01:13:22,151
Kwang Soo, you're a coward. Come out.

2062
01:13:22,951 --> 01:13:24,620
Come out, Kwang Soo.

2063
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:25,821
I'll face you.

2064
01:13:26,155 --> 01:13:27,823
(They try to lure Kwang Soo with Jong Kook hiding.)

2065
01:13:27,823 --> 01:13:30,125
Come out, Kwang Soo. I'll face you.

2066
01:13:30,826 --> 01:13:31,960
I'll face you.

2067
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,262
- Is it 1 on 1? - Yes.

2068
01:13:33,262 --> 01:13:34,730
- Is it? - Yes.

2069
01:13:34,930 --> 01:13:36,298
Come in then.

2070
01:13:36,298 --> 01:13:38,534
No, I can't trust you.

2071
01:13:38,734 --> 01:13:39,902
- No way. - Do it here.

2072
01:13:39,902 --> 01:13:41,470
- No... - Kwang Soo!

2073
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:43,939
Jong Kook is next to her.

2074
01:13:45,074 --> 01:13:46,408
Look at So Min.

2075
01:13:47,309 --> 01:13:49,912
(Their 1st attempt is not successful.)

2076
01:13:50,612 --> 01:13:52,681
We can face them head-on. There are only four of them.

2077
01:13:52,681 --> 01:13:53,749
- Open it. - One...

2078
01:13:53,749 --> 01:13:54,850
Hold on.

2079
01:13:57,553 --> 01:13:58,520
It's Jong Kook.

2080
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:01,023
(We can only go forward now.)

2081
01:14:01,023 --> 01:14:02,624
Grab his hand.

2082
01:14:03,792 --> 01:14:05,360
- I grabbed him. - Okay.

2083
01:14:05,694 --> 01:14:06,829
Push it. Go.

2084
01:14:06,829 --> 01:14:08,230
Go.

2085
01:14:09,364 --> 01:14:10,532
Three.

2086
01:14:12,534 --> 01:14:15,370
(Grabbing)

2087
01:14:15,704 --> 01:14:17,372
Push it. In 1, 2, 3.

2088
01:14:17,372 --> 01:14:18,407
(They both have their teams on their backs,)

2089
01:14:18,407 --> 01:14:19,441
(so let's face ace versus ace.)

2090
01:14:19,441 --> 01:14:20,743
Take Jong Kook's shoe.

2091
01:14:20,943 --> 01:14:22,244
Take his shoe off.

2092
01:14:22,244 --> 01:14:23,979
- Hurry. Take it off. - Good job.

2093
01:14:24,513 --> 01:14:26,548
- Good job. - Good job, Ji Hyo.

2094
01:14:26,615 --> 01:14:27,983
Good job. The other shoe.

2095
01:14:27,983 --> 01:14:33,288
(They have nowhere to back off now. It's a battle of strength.)

2096
01:14:38,093 --> 01:14:39,461
Good job. The other shoe.

2097
01:14:42,564 --> 01:14:45,300
(Kwang Soo appears out of nowhere.)

2098
01:14:45,534 --> 01:14:46,735
- So Min is out. - Hey.

2099
01:14:46,835 --> 01:14:47,870
So Min is out.

2100
01:14:49,071 --> 01:14:52,574
(He came from the back. How did that happen?)

2101
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:54,243
I'll go to the first floor.

2102
01:14:54,543 --> 01:14:56,245
(He left the battle to his team members...)

2103
01:14:56,245 --> 01:14:59,815
(and decided to take a detour.)

2104
01:15:04,052 --> 01:15:07,022
(While everybody was busy,)

2105
01:15:07,022 --> 01:15:09,658
(he approached from the back and attacked So Min.)

2106
01:15:09,658 --> 01:15:10,993
- So Min is out. - Hey.

2107
01:15:10,993 --> 01:15:13,061
So Min is out.

2108
01:15:14,563 --> 01:15:16,698
(Their plan worked.)

2109
01:15:16,698 --> 01:15:18,100
The situation is over.

2110
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,468
So Min is out.

2111
01:15:20,402 --> 01:15:22,571
- I didn't know he was there. - You have to look.

2112
01:15:23,071 --> 01:15:25,140
- It's over. The situation is over. - All right.

2113
01:15:25,908 --> 01:15:27,075
Good job.

2114
01:15:27,075 --> 01:15:28,310
(Team Red's teamwork and Kwang Soo's strategy stood out.)

2115
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:30,412
- Go upstairs. - Good job.

2116
01:15:34,283 --> 01:15:36,585
We have to decide who the winner is.

2117
01:15:36,585 --> 01:15:38,587
It's the same rule as penalty kicks in soccer.

2118
01:15:38,587 --> 01:15:40,222
(They'll decide the winning team by applying the penalty kick rules.)

2119
01:15:41,023 --> 01:15:44,393
(Penalty kicks?)

2120
01:15:44,393 --> 01:15:47,729
(People's names are in the squares.)

2121
01:15:47,729 --> 01:15:49,364
Each of you get to kick a shoe.

2122
01:15:49,565 --> 01:15:52,167
It's better for Team Red to get it in Team White's boxes,

2123
01:15:52,534 --> 01:15:54,036
and it's better for Team White to go for Team Red's boxes.

2124
01:15:54,703 --> 01:15:57,339
For example, if Kwang Soo goes first for Team Red...

2125
01:15:57,472 --> 01:15:58,841
and Haha goes first for his team,

2126
01:15:58,841 --> 01:16:00,342
if Kwang Soo gets his shoe in Team White's box...

2127
01:16:00,876 --> 01:16:03,979
and Haha does as well, Team White loses.

2128
01:16:03,979 --> 01:16:05,480
(If Haha gets his shoe in his team's box as well, they lose.)

2129
01:16:06,248 --> 01:16:07,983
- Right away? - You lose right away.

2130
01:16:07,983 --> 01:16:09,218
Really?

2131
01:16:09,284 --> 01:16:11,753
If you get the same team in a row, that team loses.

2132
01:16:13,222 --> 01:16:14,523
It's so far.

2133
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:17,159
- It's too far. - It is far.

2134
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:19,628
Who's going first?

2135
01:16:19,995 --> 01:16:21,463
- Let's start right away. - Go, Se Chan.

2136
01:16:21,463 --> 01:16:22,497
Let's go.

2137
01:16:22,497 --> 01:16:23,832
Go, Se Chan.

2138
01:16:23,832 --> 01:16:25,300
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

2139
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:26,368
- What's the order? - The winner?

2140
01:16:26,368 --> 01:16:28,203
- The winner goes first. - Rock-paper-scissors

2141
01:16:29,371 --> 01:16:30,405
(Ji Hyo wins with paper.)

2142
01:16:30,405 --> 01:16:31,540
You're first place.

2143
01:16:35,611 --> 01:16:37,579
- Okay. Ji Hyo. - Yes.

2144
01:16:38,113 --> 01:16:39,181
Nevis.

2145
01:16:39,448 --> 01:16:40,582
Swing.

2146
01:16:41,283 --> 01:16:42,351
You'll do great, Se Chan.

2147
01:16:43,252 --> 01:16:44,953
(He gets ready...)

2148
01:16:44,953 --> 01:16:48,991
(with Haha cheering for him.)

2149
01:16:50,859 --> 01:16:52,461
All right. Get a white box.

2150
01:16:52,461 --> 01:16:53,629
(They're hoping them to fail.)

2151
01:16:54,997 --> 01:16:59,101
(If he gets it in a white box, there's a good chance they'll lose.)

2152
01:16:59,601 --> 01:17:02,838
(It's beneficial for his team to get it in a red box.)

2153
01:17:05,874 --> 01:17:06,942
- White box. - White box.

2154
01:17:07,042 --> 01:17:08,143
- Yes! - Yes!

2155
01:17:09,544 --> 01:17:12,881
(He's unlucky.)

2156
01:17:13,448 --> 01:17:14,449
(He's in despair, and she's delighted.)

2157
01:17:14,449 --> 01:17:15,851
Ji Hyo, it's over if you get it in a white box.

2158
01:17:16,485 --> 01:17:18,120
End it. Get it in a white box.

2159
01:17:19,021 --> 01:17:20,322
I can't believe I got it in my name.

2160
01:17:21,523 --> 01:17:23,992
(He got it in a white box and his own name.)

2161
01:17:24,192 --> 01:17:25,961
- Be quiet. - Get a white box.

2162
01:17:26,161 --> 01:17:28,063
- Go for it. - Relax.

2163
01:17:28,063 --> 01:17:29,331
- Relax. - Let's end this.

2164
01:17:31,867 --> 01:17:33,969
(Her shoe flies low as if she's skipping a stone.)

2165
01:17:33,969 --> 01:17:34,970
Okay.

2166
01:17:35,904 --> 01:17:37,172
Let's end this.

2167
01:17:38,073 --> 01:17:40,709
(It heads left. She might miss the board entirely.)

2168
01:17:40,809 --> 01:17:43,912
(Please miss.)

2169
01:17:46,949 --> 01:17:50,419
(Nice shot, Ji Hyo.)

2170
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:55,123
(It went straight into a white box.)

2171
01:17:55,123 --> 01:17:56,758
It went in.

2172
01:17:56,758 --> 01:17:57,960
(What are you, Ji Hyo?)

2173
01:17:58,060 --> 01:17:59,561
Is this how you do it?

2174
01:17:59,561 --> 01:18:01,363
- This is how you do it. - This is how you do it, right?

2175
01:18:01,630 --> 01:18:03,332
- This is how you do it. - This is amazing.

2176
01:18:03,565 --> 01:18:06,802
So the final winning team is...

2177
01:18:06,802 --> 01:18:08,103
Han Na's team.

2178
01:18:08,103 --> 01:18:10,072
(Team Red wins.)

2179
01:18:10,072 --> 01:18:11,940
- We did it. - This is amazing.

2180
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:12,941
(Ji Hyo is so trustworthy.)

2181
01:18:12,941 --> 01:18:14,876
That was like skipping a stone.

2182
01:18:15,544 --> 01:18:17,412
(When will I be like her?)

2183
01:18:17,813 --> 01:18:21,116
(Running Bank is finally open.)

2184
01:18:22,951 --> 01:18:24,353
(Give me your money.)

2185
01:18:26,221 --> 01:18:27,522
(The team with the most money wins.)

2186
01:18:27,522 --> 01:18:29,157
(The person with the most money left wins tenfold.)

2187
01:18:29,157 --> 01:18:30,158
Explain this to me.

2188
01:18:30,158 --> 01:18:31,994
- What's going on? - I paid a lot of money earlier,

2189
01:18:31,994 --> 01:18:33,628
so the rest of you should pay.

2190
01:18:33,628 --> 01:18:35,030
Don't do that.

2191
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:38,900
It doesn't make sense for the other team not to pay.

2192
01:18:39,034 --> 01:18:41,570
Because we have the same amount of money left.

2193
01:18:41,903 --> 01:18:44,873
But they gave us 10 dollars.

2194
01:18:44,873 --> 01:18:46,241
- That's right. - They have 10 dollars less.

2195
01:18:46,241 --> 01:18:47,609
If we all pay, we win.

2196
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:51,780
If we all pay, we win.

2197
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:53,248
(If Team Red deposits all their money, they win.)

2198
01:18:53,749 --> 01:18:56,084
The only way for us to win is...

2199
01:18:56,151 --> 01:18:57,853
to deposit everything.

2200
01:18:57,953 --> 01:19:00,255
Hold on. If we deposit everything...

2201
01:19:00,255 --> 01:19:02,290
If we deposit everything,

2202
01:19:03,392 --> 01:19:05,627
how do we decide who's in first place?

2203
01:19:05,627 --> 01:19:07,362
We have to do rock-paper-scissors.

2204
01:19:07,462 --> 01:19:09,331
- It's only right to do that. - Let's do that.

2205
01:19:09,664 --> 01:19:10,732
Let's deposit everything.

2206
01:19:10,732 --> 01:19:13,301
He's saying we should win as a team first.

2207
01:19:13,301 --> 01:19:14,569
- Right. - Okay.

2208
01:19:14,903 --> 01:19:17,072
- Don't be a traitor. - I'm serious.

2209
01:19:17,072 --> 01:19:18,707
Don't be selfish.

2210
01:19:18,707 --> 01:19:20,642
- In 1, 2, 3. - Hands down.

2211
01:19:22,744 --> 01:19:25,614
Bring a suitcase each, and hand in your money.

2212
01:19:27,482 --> 01:19:30,552
I trust you. I'll pretend I'm your mom.

2213
01:19:31,753 --> 01:19:33,422
(Han Na's team has 410 dollars.)

2214
01:19:33,422 --> 01:19:35,957
(Su Jin's team has 400 dollars.)

2215
01:19:37,125 --> 01:19:39,961
(Team White has to go all-in to have a chance to win.)

2216
01:19:40,062 --> 01:19:43,298
(They usually don't trust each other. Would it be different today?)

2217
01:19:43,799 --> 01:19:48,170
I'm a big fan of myself today. I'm so cool.

2218
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:51,073
I'm happy I'm doing this for my team.

2219
01:19:51,073 --> 01:19:52,140
(He is impressed with himself.)

2220
01:19:52,908 --> 01:19:55,744
All right. Han Na's team...

2221
01:19:55,877 --> 01:19:59,047
can choose one person and ask for their amount.

2222
01:19:59,047 --> 01:20:00,449
In 1, 2, 3.

2223
01:20:00,449 --> 01:20:01,583
- So Min. - So Min.

2224
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:03,852
You'll be shocked.

2225
01:20:03,852 --> 01:20:06,822
I'll be reborn today.

2226
01:20:06,822 --> 01:20:08,156
Get ready...

2227
01:20:08,156 --> 01:20:09,791
- to shed tears for me. - Stop it.

2228
01:20:09,791 --> 01:20:11,893
I mean it. This is so not fair.

2229
01:20:11,893 --> 01:20:14,629
For this round, So Min handed in...

2230
01:20:14,629 --> 01:20:15,730
This round?

2231
01:20:15,964 --> 01:20:17,332
For this round?

2232
01:20:17,332 --> 01:20:18,467
Of course, it's this round.

2233
01:20:18,467 --> 01:20:19,668
(If So Min betrayed her team, Team White's strategy will fail.)

2234
01:20:22,537 --> 01:20:25,140
(60 dollars)

2235
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:30,145
It's all-in.

2236
01:20:30,145 --> 01:20:31,813
(From So Min's amount, it's obvious they are all-in.)

2237
01:20:33,048 --> 01:20:34,916
- Jae Seok. - I'll go first.

2238
01:20:34,916 --> 01:20:36,284
I'll go, Ji Hyo.

2239
01:20:36,284 --> 01:20:37,752
- Go ahead. - I'll go.

2240
01:20:37,752 --> 01:20:38,954
Don't betray us.

2241
01:20:40,655 --> 01:20:44,326
(If Team White is all-in, Team Red has to as well to win.)

2242
01:20:44,326 --> 01:20:48,663
(They have 410 dollars, and Team White has 400.)

2243
01:20:48,663 --> 01:20:55,570
(Is it all-in for the team or saving up for a personal victory?)

2244
01:20:58,006 --> 01:21:01,042
(Kwang Soo goes last.)

2245
01:21:01,042 --> 01:21:02,144
I have a question.

2246
01:21:02,210 --> 01:21:04,980
- What happens if it's a tie? - Don't ask.

2247
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:07,048
If it's a tie, we'll do something to decide.

2248
01:21:07,048 --> 01:21:10,352
What if I'm first place but tied with the other team?

2249
01:21:11,153 --> 01:21:12,587
Will I still be first?

2250
01:21:12,654 --> 01:21:14,523
- Hey, Kwang Soo. - Hey.

2251
01:21:14,689 --> 01:21:16,691
We'll have a match off between the first places.

2252
01:21:16,691 --> 01:21:17,692
- Between the first places? - Yes.

2253
01:21:17,692 --> 01:21:19,494
- Hey, Kwang Soo. - Hey.

2254
01:21:19,494 --> 01:21:21,062
What are you going to do?

2255
01:21:21,062 --> 01:21:22,631
(He takes a deep breath...)

2256
01:21:22,631 --> 01:21:25,967
(and steps into Running Bank with a dilemma.)

2257
01:21:27,869 --> 01:21:29,871
The winner gets tenfold the amount...

2258
01:21:29,871 --> 01:21:31,473
that the winning team has.

2259
01:21:31,873 --> 01:21:33,141
(Is that right?)

2260
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:36,044
Even if it's tenfold, it won't be much.

2261
01:21:36,311 --> 01:21:37,946
It's only 100 dollars.

2262
01:21:38,747 --> 01:21:41,483
Are you going to lose our trust?

2263
01:21:41,950 --> 01:21:44,619
With 10 dollars, how much gimbap can you get?

2264
01:21:44,953 --> 01:21:47,522
Rather, if you win and get to pick,

2265
01:21:47,522 --> 01:21:49,691
you can pick me for penalty.

2266
01:21:49,691 --> 01:21:51,126
(There's the money, but you can also choose who gets the penalty.)

2267
01:21:51,126 --> 01:21:53,562
(There was that too.)

2268
01:21:53,562 --> 01:21:55,864
You can soak me in water.

2269
01:21:55,864 --> 01:21:56,965
- No. - You can do that.

2270
01:21:57,032 --> 01:21:59,467
- Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo! - Kwang Soo.

2271
01:21:59,467 --> 01:22:00,535
(He puts his money in his pocket.)

2272
01:22:00,535 --> 01:22:02,204
- Hand it in. - Do it.

2273
01:22:02,604 --> 01:22:04,973
- You have to hand it in. - Kwang Soo.

2274
01:22:05,173 --> 01:22:07,876
- Think about it. - Hurry up.

2275
01:22:07,876 --> 01:22:08,944
(Kwang Soo deposits the money.)

2276
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:10,745
We trust you.

2277
01:22:11,246 --> 01:22:13,248
Yes. There's no point...

2278
01:22:13,248 --> 01:22:15,116
- hesitating. - Right.

2279
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:16,851
- There's no point hesitating. - We trust you.

2280
01:22:16,851 --> 01:22:18,787
There's no point. Okay.

2281
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:20,922
We have the results.

2282
01:22:21,423 --> 01:22:24,626
I'll announce the losing team.

2283
01:22:24,626 --> 01:22:25,860
The losing team deposited...

2284
01:22:27,829 --> 01:22:30,532
The losing team's total is...

2285
01:22:31,833 --> 01:22:33,301
- 360 dollars. - See?

2286
01:22:34,669 --> 01:22:37,439
- See? - They lose.

2287
01:22:38,073 --> 01:22:39,574
- Somebody kept the money? - They did.

2288
01:22:39,741 --> 01:22:41,943
- They lose with 360 dollars. - They're missing 40 dollars.

2289
01:22:41,943 --> 01:22:44,112
- I think we won. - Someone betrayed.

2290
01:22:44,112 --> 01:22:45,614
(Who betrayed their team?)

2291
01:22:45,914 --> 01:22:47,482
The winning team is...

2292
01:22:49,351 --> 01:22:50,352
Han Na's team.

2293
01:22:50,352 --> 01:22:54,623
(Team Red wins.)

2294
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:56,758
(Where did 40 dollars go?)

2295
01:22:56,758 --> 01:22:59,628
- Yes. - This is beautiful.

2296
01:22:59,761 --> 01:23:02,364
- We deposited everything? - I told you this would happen.

2297
01:23:02,364 --> 01:23:03,798
(This is hard to see on Running Man.)

2298
01:23:03,798 --> 01:23:04,866
That's right.

2299
01:23:05,734 --> 01:23:08,570
The winner in Team Red with the most amount of money...

2300
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:10,272
- There's somebody? - They have money left?

2301
01:23:10,272 --> 01:23:11,673
- There is somebody? - I gave up everything.

2302
01:23:11,673 --> 01:23:16,611
Kwang Soo wins with 20 dollars left.

2303
01:23:16,611 --> 01:23:19,547
(When everybody went all-in, I took the road not taken.)

2304
01:23:19,547 --> 01:23:21,683
- He did it. - My gosh.

2305
01:23:21,683 --> 01:23:24,319
He's unbelievable.

2306
01:23:24,653 --> 01:23:25,787
Tell me this.

2307
01:23:25,787 --> 01:23:28,590
Who's the winner in our team? Who won from the losing team?

2308
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:30,392
The winner in Team White is...

2309
01:23:31,192 --> 01:23:32,861
Se Chan with...

2310
01:23:32,861 --> 01:23:36,531
- 30 dollars. - See?

2311
01:23:36,531 --> 01:23:38,433
2nd place is So Min with 10 dollars.

2312
01:23:38,433 --> 01:23:39,467
Gosh.

2313
01:23:40,368 --> 01:23:42,203
It's only 10 dollars.

2314
01:23:42,203 --> 01:23:44,072
If we deposited everything, it would have worked.

2315
01:23:44,472 --> 01:23:45,573
Wait, I have a question.

2316
01:23:45,707 --> 01:23:47,242
Is there a second place in our team?

2317
01:23:47,442 --> 01:23:48,810
- There isn't. - They have nothing left.

2318
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:50,245
You're the only one who have money left.

2319
01:23:50,245 --> 01:23:51,946
- You have to be punished. - You need to be punished.

2320
01:23:51,946 --> 01:23:53,381
Why are you booing at me?

2321
01:23:53,882 --> 01:23:56,151
- I heard that. - You need to be punished.

2322
01:23:56,484 --> 01:23:58,453
- Take your 200 dollars. - Take your money.

2323
01:23:58,453 --> 01:24:00,021
- You need to get the penalty. - Take the penalty.

2324
01:24:00,021 --> 01:24:01,323
Hold on.

2325
01:24:01,756 --> 01:24:03,091
According to the rules,

2326
01:24:03,091 --> 01:24:05,160
don't I pick 1 from my team and 3 from the other?

2327
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,529
- Yes. According to the rules, - We talked about this.

2328
01:24:07,529 --> 01:24:10,165
the winner picks one person from their own team...

2329
01:24:10,165 --> 01:24:11,666
and three from the other team.

2330
01:24:11,666 --> 01:24:12,801
Okay.

2331
01:24:12,801 --> 01:24:15,270
- Jong Kook mentioned himself. - Right.

2332
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:16,905
I'll pick him...

2333
01:24:16,905 --> 01:24:18,206
- for sure. - Okay.

2334
01:24:18,206 --> 01:24:20,809
I'm so sweaty. I want a shower. This is driving me nuts.

2335
01:24:20,809 --> 01:24:24,913
- I'll exclude you then. - No, no.

2336
01:24:24,913 --> 01:24:27,849
- I won't pick you. - I'm so sweaty.

2337
01:24:27,849 --> 01:24:29,551
- Come on. - It's not you.

2338
01:24:29,551 --> 01:24:31,586
Go to a public bathhouse. No.

2339
01:24:31,586 --> 01:24:32,954
I'll pick.

2340
01:24:33,254 --> 01:24:34,956
I remember that scene.

2341
01:24:35,023 --> 01:24:36,691
When we were eating, Jae Seok was...

2342
01:24:36,691 --> 01:24:39,060
supposed to treat Haha like an older brother,

2343
01:24:39,327 --> 01:24:41,696
but what did you do instead?

2344
01:24:41,696 --> 01:24:43,565
- He finished his food. - I don't know. I don't remember.

2345
01:24:44,666 --> 01:24:46,101
Do you want the penalty?

2346
01:24:46,601 --> 01:24:48,703
No, let me repeat myself.

2347
01:24:48,803 --> 01:24:50,572
- I'm on your side, Kwang Soo. - Then...

2348
01:24:50,572 --> 01:24:52,173
- Then let's... - You're on his side?

2349
01:24:52,173 --> 01:24:53,241
- I'm on your side, Kwang Soo. - Seok Jin.

2350
01:24:53,241 --> 01:24:55,243
- What's wrong with you? - Seok Jin, you're exempt.

2351
01:24:55,243 --> 01:24:57,579
Okay. Yes. Kwang Soo.

2352
01:24:57,579 --> 01:25:03,852
Kwang Soo is our sun

2353
01:25:03,852 --> 01:25:07,155
- Hey! - I always love you

2354
01:25:07,255 --> 01:25:10,258
- Kwang Soo, you're beautiful - Kwang Soo

2355
01:25:10,258 --> 01:25:12,994
I'm jealous that you're tall, I'm really jealous

2356
01:25:12,994 --> 01:25:14,028
I'll give you a kiss

2357
01:25:14,362 --> 01:25:16,364
- I'll give you a kiss - I'll give you a kiss

2358
01:25:17,132 --> 01:25:18,933
Let's do this. You can stand,

2359
01:25:18,933 --> 01:25:20,702
and Kwang Soo will push three people forward.

2360
01:25:20,702 --> 01:25:22,070
- All right. - Okay. Three people?

2361
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:23,538
- Three people. - Finish this off fast.

2362
01:25:24,406 --> 01:25:25,440
Don't be so hopeful.

2363
01:25:26,441 --> 01:25:27,542
Don't be.

2364
01:25:27,942 --> 01:25:30,812
(So Min gets picked.)

2365
01:25:30,812 --> 01:25:31,813
I can take my shirt off.

2366
01:25:32,814 --> 01:25:35,283
(Which two should I pick?)

2367
01:25:35,450 --> 01:25:36,785
- He didn't even stop to think. - Kwang Soo.

2368
01:25:36,785 --> 01:25:39,020
I have to receive the penalty.

2369
01:25:39,354 --> 01:25:40,955
Ask him to pick you.

2370
01:25:40,955 --> 01:25:43,091
Kwang Soo, I have to receive the penalty in this situation.

2371
01:25:43,091 --> 01:25:45,326
Don't pick Se Chan so that his heart will stay heavy.

2372
01:25:45,326 --> 01:25:47,695
(Don't pick Se Chan so that his heart will stay heavy.)

2373
01:25:47,695 --> 01:25:48,997
Don't pick Se Chan.

2374
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:50,331
Kwang Soo,

2375
01:25:50,331 --> 01:25:51,332
- why don't you pick me instead? - Today,

2376
01:25:51,332 --> 01:25:53,101
who left money behind besides Se Chan?

2377
01:25:53,101 --> 01:25:54,302
- So Min. - So Min.

2378
01:25:54,302 --> 01:25:57,172
- Then I will pick again. - Ask her to come back.

2379
01:25:57,338 --> 01:25:58,907
- No. - You will pick other three members.

2380
01:25:58,907 --> 01:26:01,342
(It shouldn't go this way.)

2381
01:26:01,342 --> 01:26:03,244
You will pick other three members.

2382
01:26:03,878 --> 01:26:06,614
What are you doing? Get up.

2383
01:26:06,981 --> 01:26:08,283
- All right. - We will receive the penalty.

2384
01:26:08,283 --> 01:26:10,752
- We will make them feel bad. - Why did choose me?

2385
01:26:10,919 --> 01:26:13,087
Okay. I will receive the penalty in their stead.

2386
01:26:13,087 --> 01:26:15,890
(I get it.)

2387
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:18,326
With the heart of a mother, I will receive it in their stead.

2388
01:26:18,326 --> 01:26:20,195
For Se Chan and So Min,

2389
01:26:20,195 --> 01:26:21,963
- I will receive it in their stead. - We need to fix their habit.

2390
01:26:22,263 --> 01:26:23,965
Kwang Soo, please pick me.

2391
01:26:23,965 --> 01:26:25,500
No, please pick me.

2392
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,101
Kwang Soo, you have to pick me.

2393
01:26:27,101 --> 01:26:28,102
I will receive the penalty twice.

2394
01:26:28,903 --> 01:26:29,904
I will push.

2395
01:26:30,205 --> 01:26:31,239
I will receive the penalty.

2396
01:26:33,041 --> 01:26:34,909
Please push me hard.

2397
01:26:34,909 --> 01:26:37,679
I want to receive the penalty with Se Chan.

2398
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:38,680
(With a generous heart,)

2399
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:39,681
Okay.

2400
01:26:39,681 --> 01:26:42,350
(he picks So Min and Se Chan.)

2401
01:26:43,151 --> 01:26:45,553
Thank you. My heart feels light now.

2402
01:26:46,154 --> 01:26:48,256
He doesn't pick Jong Kook when he wants the penalty.

2403
01:26:49,090 --> 01:26:50,191
My goodness.

2404
01:26:51,059 --> 01:26:54,062
So Min, Se Chan, and Haha are chosen.

2405
01:26:54,062 --> 01:26:56,498
Now, Kwang Soo will pick a member from Team Red.

2406
01:26:56,498 --> 01:26:58,132
Please push him or her from behind.

2407
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:00,969
Can't Kwang Soo receive the penalty?

2408
01:27:00,969 --> 01:27:03,872
Kwang Soo shouldn't receive the penalty.

2409
01:27:03,872 --> 01:27:05,273
He is the winner. That wouldn't make any sense.

2410
01:27:05,773 --> 01:27:07,075
In my team...

2411
01:27:07,342 --> 01:27:08,810
He makes me so angry.

2412
01:27:08,810 --> 01:27:12,080
He makes me angrier than getting hit with water bomb.

2413
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,615
He is so annoying.

2414
01:27:13,781 --> 01:27:14,949
- Feeling! - Intuition!

2415
01:27:14,949 --> 01:27:16,084
- Cross! - Cross!

2416
01:27:17,418 --> 01:27:19,153
- For goodness' sake. - Kwang Soo is the best.

2417
01:27:19,153 --> 01:27:21,222
This is why I like Seok Jin.

2418
01:27:21,222 --> 01:27:23,391
This is why I love you.

2419
01:27:23,825 --> 01:27:26,694
Gosh, I am angry. I am so angry.

2420
01:27:27,362 --> 01:27:28,763
From my team,

2421
01:27:28,763 --> 01:27:31,366
I will pick the person who is on my right.

2422
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:36,671
(He wants his favorite member to take a shower.)

2423
01:27:37,071 --> 01:27:38,907
- Kwang Soo. - That was good.

2424
01:27:39,073 --> 01:27:41,009
- Come here. - It's a wonderful idea.

2425
01:27:41,009 --> 01:27:44,479
I made up my mind...

2426
01:27:44,479 --> 01:27:46,180
- during the first game. - The first game?

2427
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:48,049
- That's when I made up my mind. - Good choice.

2428
01:27:48,049 --> 01:27:49,450
You made the right decision.

2429
01:27:49,450 --> 01:27:51,286
Thus, water bomb goes...

2430
01:27:51,452 --> 01:27:53,655
to Se Chan, So Min, Haha, and Seok Jin.

2431
01:27:53,655 --> 01:27:54,689
All right.

2432
01:27:54,822 --> 01:27:57,292
Kwang Soo will receive the prize money of 200 dollars.

2433
01:27:57,292 --> 01:27:59,561
(Kwang Soo, the winner, receives the prize money of 200 dollars.)

2434
01:27:59,561 --> 01:28:00,995
He even gets 200 dollars.

2435
01:28:02,130 --> 01:28:04,899
Why did you pick me?

2436
01:28:04,999 --> 01:28:06,701
I decided to pick you...

2437
01:28:07,001 --> 01:28:08,770
when you put so much sauce under the rice.

2438
01:28:09,203 --> 01:28:11,139
- There is a reason. - He did that.

2439
01:28:11,139 --> 01:28:13,408
- I added ginger. - He added ginger.

2440
01:28:13,408 --> 01:28:14,442
- Ginger. - Hold on.

2441
01:28:15,076 --> 01:28:16,811
Didn't you guys put ginger, wasabi, and chogochujang?

2442
01:28:17,145 --> 01:28:19,447
(Ginger, wasabi, and chogochujang)

2443
01:28:19,447 --> 01:28:21,182
- Wasabi. - Okay!

2444
01:28:21,849 --> 01:28:24,285
- I know you did it. - Yes, we did.

2445
01:28:24,586 --> 01:28:25,954
There is a reason behind my decision.

2446
01:28:25,954 --> 01:28:26,955
There is a reason.

2447
01:28:28,089 --> 01:28:29,657
Hurry up, and stand over there.

2448
01:28:29,657 --> 01:28:30,658
Okay.

2449
01:28:31,392 --> 01:28:33,661
Today, Kwang Soo...

2450
01:28:34,062 --> 01:28:37,031
- left behind 20 dollars. - He is incredible.

2451
01:28:37,031 --> 01:28:38,800
- Seriously. - Had I not done that,

2452
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,101
I would have received the penalty.

2453
01:28:40,101 --> 01:28:42,103
(Had I not done that, I would have received the penalty.)

2454
01:28:42,103 --> 01:28:43,571
That's plausible.

2455
01:28:43,571 --> 01:28:45,273
- You are right. - My goodness.

2456
01:28:45,273 --> 01:28:47,408
- I have done this many times. - You are mistaken.

2457
01:28:47,408 --> 01:28:49,110
I have done this many times.

2458
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:50,678
- I understand. - Before anything,

2459
01:28:50,812 --> 01:28:54,182
Su Jin and Han Na did...

2460
01:28:54,182 --> 01:28:55,617
a great job today.

2461
01:28:55,984 --> 01:28:58,219
- Thank you. - How was everything, Su Jin?

2462
01:28:58,219 --> 01:29:01,689
Visiting Running Man and playing games...

2463
01:29:02,023 --> 01:29:02,991
made me want to come back.

2464
01:29:02,991 --> 01:29:04,492
- I know. - It was fun.

2465
01:29:04,492 --> 01:29:05,860
I also had a lot of fun.

2466
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:08,496
I want to come back when the weather is warm.

2467
01:29:08,496 --> 01:29:10,198
- All right. - It doesn't get warmer than this.

2468
01:29:10,198 --> 01:29:12,200
(It doesn't get warmer than this.)

2469
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,702
Why are you so grumpy?

2470
01:29:14,702 --> 01:29:15,703
What's wrong with you?

2471
01:29:15,703 --> 01:29:18,272
Why do I get hit with the water bomb when we worked together?

2472
01:29:18,272 --> 01:29:19,507
It's warm enough.

2473
01:29:19,507 --> 01:29:21,643
This is how the weather normally is in November.

2474
01:29:23,211 --> 01:29:26,114
I will pull the lever at the count of three.

2475
01:29:26,481 --> 01:29:28,883
Han Na and Su Jin, you did a great job today.

2476
01:29:29,217 --> 01:29:30,218
In one,

2477
01:29:31,152 --> 01:29:32,220
two,

2478
01:29:33,221 --> 01:29:34,222
three.

2479
01:29:37,859 --> 01:29:39,293
(Splashing)

2480
01:29:40,795 --> 01:29:42,730
(This is what happens to traitors.)

2481
01:29:46,601 --> 01:29:48,670
(Seaweed appears.)

2482
01:29:51,005 --> 01:29:52,440
- Look at Haha. - My goodness.

2483
01:29:53,641 --> 01:29:54,709
- Look at Haha. - My goodness.

2484
01:29:55,209 --> 01:29:56,878
(They show that no evil goes unpunished.)

2485
01:29:56,878 --> 01:29:59,614
Look at Haha.

2486
01:29:59,781 --> 01:30:00,782
This is hilarious.

2487
01:30:01,582 --> 01:30:05,086
(It's so refreshing.)

2488
01:30:05,953 --> 01:30:07,522
(The presentation of the prize money is a happy event.)

2489
01:30:07,522 --> 01:30:10,191
(A woman gets taken out in a mysterious way.)

2490
01:30:10,191 --> 01:30:12,694
(Then the prize money disappears.)

2491
01:30:13,561 --> 01:30:15,563
(Is there an evildoer among them?)

2492
01:30:15,563 --> 01:30:17,465
(What are you doing?)

2493
01:30:18,232 --> 01:30:20,401
(The culprit needs to eliminate the witness.)

2494
01:30:20,401 --> 01:30:22,336
(I learned something.)

2495
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:24,072
(I have information on the woman.)

2496
01:30:24,072 --> 01:30:27,508
(The evildoer tries to destroy the evidence.)

2497
01:30:27,508 --> 01:30:31,179
(More information on the evildoer surfaces.)

2498
01:30:31,179 --> 01:30:34,082
(Find the evildoer who is hiding his or her identity.)

2499
01:30:34,082 --> 01:30:37,652
(The culprit is among us.)

2500
01:30:38,653 --> 01:30:41,322
(Who is the evildoer with an angelic face?)

2501
01:30:41,322 --> 01:30:45,193
(Bad Guys: War against the Evildoer)
