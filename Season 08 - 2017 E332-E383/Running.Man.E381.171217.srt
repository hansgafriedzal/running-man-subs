1
00:00:06,916 --> 00:00:10,280
(A wedding hall in Ilsan is on the threshold of winter.)

2
00:00:10,287 --> 00:00:11,980
- Hello. - Hi.

3
00:00:11,988 --> 00:00:14,350
- Good morning. - Hello.

4
00:00:14,357 --> 00:00:16,390
Doesn't Jong Kook look great in his outfit today?

5
00:00:16,393 --> 00:00:18,890
- Jong Kook. - In our last shoot, people...

6
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:20,600
looked down on me when I dressed down.

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,690
- You just wore a new coat. - So I dressed up today.

8
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:23,700
- That's right. - Seok Jin.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,570
When I take off the coat, it's the same outfit.

10
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:28,370
- You only wore a new coat. - Why is he being so stubborn?

11
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:31,070
- You just have a new coat. - No one can change his mind.

12
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:32,140
(His outfit hasn't changed.)

13
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:35,740
Today, you'll be joined by actors who receive more love...

14
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:37,350
whenever they do evil things.

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,910
It is a race with actors who are most know for portraying villains.

16
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,010
- My goodness. - Actors will join us today?

17
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:44,520
- These days... - Villains are very popular.

18
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:46,420
- They are indeed. - That's true.

19
00:00:48,358 --> 00:00:50,090
(He walks with confidence.)

20
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:53,160
(His silhouette exudes the presence of a villain.)

21
00:00:53,797 --> 00:00:55,500
- My goodness. - Gosh.

22
00:00:56,066 --> 00:00:57,900
- It's him. - He's a great actor.

23
00:00:57,901 --> 00:00:59,700
- He's dressed up. - He's like a brother to me.

24
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:02,840
He's like a brother to us. We are close friends.

25
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:07,180
(Choi Gwi Hwa, the most sought-after villain actor)

26
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:11,380
(He's the devil-like cop in a plain outfit in "A Taxi Driver".)

27
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:15,080
(He acts in various roles and is a popular actor in film industry.)

28
00:01:16,486 --> 00:01:18,020
It's like he dressed up for an awards ceremony.

29
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:22,390
I thought you were the owner of a restaurant.

30
00:01:22,392 --> 00:01:23,620
(Sir, is everything to your liking?)

31
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:25,320
- I'm ready to order now. - My brother.

32
00:01:25,328 --> 00:01:26,490
- I'd like a hamburger steak. - Hello.

33
00:01:26,496 --> 00:01:27,490
- Sure. - A hamburger steak, please.

34
00:01:27,497 --> 00:01:29,090
Why did you get so dressed up?

35
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:31,930
Why did you bring this book? Is it called "Tongue Fu"?

36
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:34,640
There isn't a reason behind it.

37
00:01:34,738 --> 00:01:36,870
I just wanted to rely on something.

38
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:39,000
- That was part of your act? - Gwi Hwa...

39
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:40,170
Did you bring it from home?

40
00:01:40,176 --> 00:01:42,010
- No, I got it from here. - Gwi Hwa...

41
00:01:42,278 --> 00:01:43,610
He is...

42
00:01:43,613 --> 00:01:46,210
- As you all know... - Don't do that. He looks older.

43
00:01:46,216 --> 00:01:48,550
- Seok Jin. - He's younger than me.

44
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:51,080
I didn't know, but I found out he's my college alumnus.

45
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:52,120
- Really? - He's a junior alumnus.

46
00:01:52,122 --> 00:01:53,420
- Seriously? - That's right.

47
00:01:53,423 --> 00:01:55,220
- I went to school before him. - Is that so?

48
00:01:55,592 --> 00:01:56,820
He's younger than you, Haha?

49
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:58,290
No, he's not younger than me.

50
00:01:58,294 --> 00:01:59,690
- I entered college before him. - You went to school before him.

51
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:02,590
- Gwi Hwa is a year older than Haha. - He is?

52
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,600
- Just 1 year? - 1 year?

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,000
(He's only a year older?)

54
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:06,840
- He must've gone to school late. - He's a year older than me.

55
00:02:07,303 --> 00:02:09,970
- I went to school a year later. - Have you heard about Haha?

56
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:10,970
I actually saw him a lot.

57
00:02:10,974 --> 00:02:13,270
- How was he then? Be honest. - Exactly.

58
00:02:13,276 --> 00:02:16,310
I heard he went to Itaewon often.

59
00:02:16,312 --> 00:02:17,310
He used to tout on the street.

60
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:19,340
- He was like an arch in Itaewon. - What?

61
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:20,750
(Haha was an arch in college.)

62
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,380
Arch? He was like an arch?

63
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:24,720
- Arch? - He was always there like an arch.

64
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:26,320
- I see. - I get it.

65
00:02:26,523 --> 00:02:28,390
- I have a funny story about him. - What is it?

66
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:30,990
- Was it Haha and my classmates? - Senior alumni?

67
00:02:31,694 --> 00:02:32,990
One time, they went over to Haha's house.

68
00:02:32,996 --> 00:02:35,330
- Really? - They went to his house late drunk.

69
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:36,800
- People do go to his house often. - His mother...

70
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,770
(They went to his house drunk late at night, and his mother...)

71
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:42,600
She threw salt at them and said, "You demons!"

72
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:44,640
(Demons, get lost!)

73
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:45,710
You demons!

74
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:48,570
- It was when she was religious. - "You demons!"

75
00:02:48,578 --> 00:02:50,610
- She was very religious then. - I see. She was into that.

76
00:02:50,613 --> 00:02:51,980
When I went home drunk...

77
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:53,410
How drunk were you?

78
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,650
"You demons".

79
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:56,350
"You lewd beings!"

80
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,220
That's hilarious.

81
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:00,120
- Let's bring out the next guest. - Okay.

82
00:03:00,123 --> 00:03:02,220
- Please come on out. - I'm so curious.

83
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:03,290
Who is it?

84
00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:07,590
(A man in a red suit...)

85
00:03:07,597 --> 00:03:11,630
(is here to take over Running Man.)

86
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:13,500
- My goodness! - Oh, my!

87
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:15,330
- "Do you know who I am?" - Here he comes.

88
00:03:15,338 --> 00:03:16,630
- His outfit looks great. - He was in a gang in a film.

89
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,370
- My goodness. - He only plays scary roles.

90
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,940
(Heo Sung Tae, a late bloomer)

91
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,610
(He debuted in "The Age of Shadows" after working at a big company.)

92
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:26,110
(Do you know who I am?)

93
00:03:26,115 --> 00:03:28,780
(He's a hair-raising actor that the whole nation knows.)

94
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:30,320
Please come here.

95
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,390
Come this way, please.

96
00:03:31,488 --> 00:03:33,420
- He's shy as expected. - This is great.

97
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:35,020
- He looks shy. - He's shy.

98
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:36,350
Sung Tae.

99
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:37,820
- He looks so young among them. - What is this?

100
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:39,960
- It's a corduroy suit. - It's coffee.

101
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:43,160
- Why are you drinking like that? - What is that?

102
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,130
- Why are they putting up an act? - Why is he coming up with an act?

103
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:46,400
- I'm sorry. - This is so obvious.

104
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:48,840
Why did you put coffee in a water bottle?

105
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:50,270
- What are you doing? - It's tasty.

106
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:52,070
Did you make your own coffee at home?

107
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:53,470
- Yes. - Sung Tae.

108
00:03:53,476 --> 00:03:57,080
- Yes? - Did you buy new shoes?

109
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,380
(Shiny)

110
00:03:58,381 --> 00:03:59,810
- They are... - They are new shoes.

111
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:02,080
- The head of my agency bought them. - Oh, really?

112
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:03,650
They were for Running Man.

113
00:04:03,653 --> 00:04:05,280
The head of your agency bought them for you?

114
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:07,920
The head of my agency runs a tailor shop.

115
00:04:07,924 --> 00:04:08,990
(He's feeling shy.)

116
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:10,990
- I'm serious. - Seriously?

117
00:04:10,994 --> 00:04:12,790
- He really runs it? - He runs a tailor shop?

118
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:13,960
- The suit is a bit... - The corduroy suit...

119
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:15,730
The corduroy suit looks great on you.

120
00:04:15,732 --> 00:04:18,830
- The head of his agency runs it. - I see.

121
00:04:19,068 --> 00:04:20,630
- This is interesting. - It's unique.

122
00:04:20,637 --> 00:04:23,570
Right now, he seems quite innocent.

123
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:25,640
- He's like a naive country guy. - Right.

124
00:04:25,642 --> 00:04:28,380
Seok Jin, he dressed up for today. Don't say he's from the country.

125
00:04:29,012 --> 00:04:30,810
I just meant emphasize that he looks very innocent.

126
00:04:31,614 --> 00:04:36,680
I think you're recycling a few of your own lines.

127
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:39,620
- I came up with 5 lines today. - 5 lines?

128
00:04:39,622 --> 00:04:41,850
I keep on switching with those five lines.

129
00:04:41,858 --> 00:04:43,050
- I only use those five. - They are all the same.

130
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:45,720
- When the guests come out... - I don't have many.

131
00:04:45,728 --> 00:04:46,720
(He shouts first.)

132
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:48,300
"Who is that?"

133
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:50,400
- He doesn't know their names. - He doesn't.

134
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:52,000
"A naive country guy."

135
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,000
He only has about five lines.

136
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:56,370
- All right. The next guest. - We have another guest?

137
00:04:57,106 --> 00:04:58,600
- Who is that? - Here it is.

138
00:04:58,608 --> 00:04:59,770
(Hang on. That actor is...)

139
00:05:00,977 --> 00:05:04,810
(Who is the third villain actor who defies their expectations?)

140
00:05:05,615 --> 00:05:07,580
- Hey! - You're seriously frightening!

141
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:08,810
He's the lawyer.

142
00:05:08,818 --> 00:05:10,380
- He's such a great actor. - He plays the lawyer.

143
00:05:10,386 --> 00:05:11,450
That's right.

144
00:05:12,722 --> 00:05:13,720
It's Lee Sang Yeob.

145
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:16,190
(Lee Sang Yeob, a good-looking actor with unexpected charisma)

146
00:05:16,893 --> 00:05:20,460
(He played an evil lawyer in "While You Were Sleeping".)

147
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:23,190
(His charisma concealed in his gentleness wins women's hearts.)

148
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,030
I was texting So Min last night.

149
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:28,540
She must have known who the guests would be.

150
00:05:28,605 --> 00:05:30,870
She complained to me that Lee Sang Yeob will be...

151
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:31,970
the only guest who is young.

152
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:33,200
- So Min said that. - My goodness.

153
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:34,810
- I can't believe her. - Please don't mind her.

154
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:36,810
They are young.

155
00:05:36,913 --> 00:05:39,440
- They aren't very old. - Seriously.

156
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:40,480
For goodness' sake.

157
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:42,810
Please step back.

158
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:43,850
My goodness. I am sorry, Haha.

159
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:46,550
What has gotten into you?

160
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:47,620
I stepped on your foot.

161
00:05:47,624 --> 00:05:50,690
She took on a strange concept.

162
00:05:50,693 --> 00:05:51,890
(She acts strangely in front of Sang Yeob.)

163
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:52,990
Is there someone you like?

164
00:05:52,996 --> 00:05:54,030
It must be Sang Yeob.

165
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,990
She must like Sang Yeob.

166
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:57,730
She said, "He is handsome."

167
00:05:57,867 --> 00:05:59,400
- He is the young guest. - She was shy.

168
00:05:59,636 --> 00:06:00,800
You know,

169
00:06:00,803 --> 00:06:03,470
just how many people are you interested in?

170
00:06:03,473 --> 00:06:04,540
Seriously.

171
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,800
She is interested in Sang Yeob today.

172
00:06:05,808 --> 00:06:07,610
(Let's see if So Min's love comes true.)

173
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,640
It's time to introduce the last guest of the day.

174
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:12,980
- Please come on in. - Don't get too excited.

175
00:06:14,984 --> 00:06:16,250
- My goodness. - It's a woman.

176
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:18,050
- My goodness. - Kwang Soo knows her.

177
00:06:18,054 --> 00:06:20,590
(The female guest in a black dress piques everyone's interest.)

178
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,720
My goodness.

179
00:06:21,724 --> 00:06:22,990
(She is beautiful.)

180
00:06:22,992 --> 00:06:24,760
- Kwang Soo knows her. - That's right.

181
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:26,790
- She played your wife in a drama. - That's right.

182
00:06:26,796 --> 00:06:28,160
- Go Bo Gyeol. - Go Bo Gyeol.

183
00:06:28,164 --> 00:06:30,570
(Go Bo Gyeol has an innocent charm that grabs people's attention.)

184
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:37,770
(When she plays the villain, her innocence looks give a twist.)

185
00:06:41,744 --> 00:06:43,540
That's right.

186
00:06:43,546 --> 00:06:45,440
- I recognize her. - Hello.

187
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:47,580
Bo Gyeol, it's nice to meet you. Please come here.

188
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,520
It has been a while.

189
00:06:49,552 --> 00:06:51,280
Bo Gyeol,

190
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:53,120
is this your first time to appear in a variety show?

191
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:55,990
The first variety show I was in happens to be "One Night Two Days".

192
00:06:55,992 --> 00:06:57,720
- Were you in "One Night Two Days"? - Yes.

193
00:06:57,727 --> 00:06:58,820
- Really? - How did that happen?

194
00:06:58,828 --> 00:07:00,060
It happened by chance.

195
00:07:00,063 --> 00:07:03,130
I ran into the members in a bus on New Year's Day.

196
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:09,000
(She ran into Jong Min and Jun Ho on a bus.)

197
00:07:09,105 --> 00:07:10,900
- We will meet again. - That's right.

198
00:07:10,907 --> 00:07:12,340
(She appeared for 3 seconds.)

199
00:07:12,341 --> 00:07:14,510
You will be a great actress.

200
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,780
Don't give up on your dream.

201
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:17,910
With whom were you on the program?

202
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:18,980
- She wasn't invited as a guest. - "One Night Two Days".

203
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,820
I doesn't count as a TV appearance.

204
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,010
It only counts if you receive the official payment.

205
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:24,880
(It only counts if you receive the official payment.)

206
00:07:24,887 --> 00:07:26,320
"The official payment"!

207
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:28,250
(The technical term sounds a bit cheap.)

208
00:07:28,257 --> 00:07:30,660
It only counts when you get money sent to your bank account.

209
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,620
- You didn't receive an invitation. - No.

210
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:33,690
Then this is your first appearance.

211
00:07:33,696 --> 00:07:35,790
It only counts when there is an order from the CEO.

212
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:37,700
This is your first appearance on a variety show.

213
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,830
I see.

214
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:40,570
She was my wife in a drama.

215
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,800
- Really? - Yes.

216
00:07:41,804 --> 00:07:43,170
- Really? - She is his ex-wife.

217
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,510
- Why did you break up in the drama? - She didn't play my ex-wife.

218
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:47,110
Have you received a personal text from Kwang Soo?

219
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,610
- No, I haven't. - You haven't.

220
00:07:49,612 --> 00:07:53,210
I think Kwang Soo is under the wrong impression.

221
00:07:53,216 --> 00:07:57,320
He said you liked him a little bit.

222
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,650
For goodness' sake.

223
00:07:58,888 --> 00:08:00,020
What are you talking about?

224
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,150
You didn't, did you?

225
00:08:01,157 --> 00:08:03,860
- It's a groundless rumor. - It's a groundless rumor, right?

226
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,990
- A groundless rumor! - I thought so.

227
00:08:06,062 --> 00:08:07,260
No, no.

228
00:08:07,263 --> 00:08:08,630
I never said that. He is lying.

229
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:09,930
Please don't misunderstand.

230
00:08:09,932 --> 00:08:11,230
Please don't feel awkward. I never said that.

231
00:08:11,234 --> 00:08:13,300
Se Chan's comment will make you uncomfortable...

232
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:14,930
throughout the shoot today.

233
00:08:14,937 --> 00:08:17,440
Why did you say that during the opening?

234
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,400
You made me uncomfortable.

235
00:08:19,408 --> 00:08:20,510
It's something you always do.

236
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,240
- Is it really a lie? - Yes, it is.

237
00:08:24,514 --> 00:08:26,080
For today's race,

238
00:08:26,082 --> 00:08:27,880
we have talented actors who play villains.

239
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:29,210
Enduring pain will give you...

240
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,350
- a higher chance of winning... - Endure pain?

241
00:08:31,354 --> 00:08:34,290
- in The Age of Scream. - What is that?

242
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,990
The prize money for each round will be 1,000 dollars.

243
00:08:38,127 --> 00:08:40,860
The winner will receive the money right away.

244
00:08:40,863 --> 00:08:42,260
- Will we receive cash? - You will receive it right away.

245
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:43,800
- Right away? - Will we receive cash?

246
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:47,270
Let's move on with the first mission that has 1,000 dollars on the line.

247
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:50,840
- Please stand in a single line. - Why?

248
00:08:51,974 --> 00:08:53,940
We can stand wherever we want as long as it's in a line?

249
00:08:53,943 --> 00:08:55,610
- The order is random. - I want to change positions.

250
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:57,210
- Which end is the front? - It's a hit-or-miss situation.

251
00:08:57,213 --> 00:08:58,610
Which end is the front?

252
00:08:58,614 --> 00:08:59,780
The left is the front.

253
00:08:59,782 --> 00:09:01,150
We can stand in a horizontal line.

254
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:03,180
Gwi Hwa, do you want to move to the front?

255
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:04,450
Sure thing.

256
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:05,590
(Clearing his throat)

257
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:06,850
Sure thing.

258
00:09:08,324 --> 00:09:10,150
I am sorry, but...

259
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,220
- My goodness. - Are you okay?

260
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:13,290
- I forgot. - He has phlegm.

261
00:09:13,296 --> 00:09:16,200
Gwi Hwa is the phlegm fairy. He spits out phlegm very often.

262
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:17,930
- I didn't get a lot of sleep. - I see.

263
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:19,430
You didn't get a lot of sleep.

264
00:09:19,535 --> 00:09:21,170
The sound wasn't grating.

265
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,200
- It was pleasant. - It was cute.

266
00:09:22,205 --> 00:09:23,800
- Are you saying my phlegm is cute? - It was a clear sound.

267
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:26,140
He doesn't try to hide it.

268
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:27,410
How should we decide on the order?

269
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,770
Let's go with our instinct.

270
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:30,950
- I like it here. - Where do you want to stand?

271
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,440
First?

272
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:36,380
- I will stand next to Ji Hyo. - Okay. Stand here.

273
00:09:37,153 --> 00:09:39,020
In that case...

274
00:09:39,021 --> 00:09:41,650
- Don't do that! - What are you doing?

275
00:09:41,657 --> 00:09:43,190
Then I will stand between them.

276
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,360
Then I will stand over here.

277
00:09:47,663 --> 00:09:49,560
(This isn't what I wanted.)

278
00:09:49,565 --> 00:09:50,600
That's possible.

279
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,830
Bo Gyeol, do you want to stand here?

280
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:53,670
- Come here. - Then I will stand over here.

281
00:09:54,203 --> 00:09:55,400
Come here.

282
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,370
Gosh, Kwang Soo is at it again.

283
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,440
(He suddenly changes his attitude.)

284
00:10:01,444 --> 00:10:02,780
You called her over here.

285
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:05,110
- You are at it again. - What are you talking about?

286
00:10:05,114 --> 00:10:07,650
- You can move to the other side. - What are you talking about?

287
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,450
Hold on. In that case,

288
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:12,120
- I will stand between them. - Don't be ridiculous!

289
00:10:12,722 --> 00:10:14,190
For goodness' sake.

290
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,990
(They nip Kwang Soo's advance in the bud.)

291
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:16,990
The position is set.

292
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:19,590
(The position is set.)

293
00:10:19,595 --> 00:10:21,260
The first mission is...

294
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:23,930
Scream-inducing Confession.

295
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:27,470
You will play rock-paper-scissors with the person next to you.

296
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,200
The winner gets to hit the loser's forehead...

297
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:32,100
or pull their sideburns.

298
00:10:32,108 --> 00:10:33,840
(Hit the loser's forehead or pull their sideburns.)

299
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:36,310
- I should have stood over here. - Oh, my goodness.

300
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:39,110
- Which way are we moving? - From right to left.

301
00:10:39,148 --> 00:10:41,480
These sideburns are perfect for the game.

302
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:43,280
(He has sideburns that are perfect for the game.)

303
00:10:43,286 --> 00:10:46,420
You get eliminated if you make a sound or grimace.

304
00:10:46,422 --> 00:10:49,320
The last one standing receives the prize money of 1,000 dollars.

305
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:51,790
If you lose in rock-paper-scissors,

306
00:10:51,928 --> 00:10:53,660
you receive the penalty...

307
00:10:53,663 --> 00:10:55,490
and the direction of the attack changes.

308
00:10:55,498 --> 00:10:57,360
If it's a tie,

309
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:00,260
the other member gets eliminated right away.

310
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:01,570
The other member gets eliminated if it's a tie.

311
00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:03,630
Ji Hyo will begin.

312
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:04,870
How will I hit her?

313
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:06,170
Play rock-paper-scissors.

314
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:07,910
- I would rather not get hit. - Rock-paper-scissors

315
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,380
(The winner hits the loser. Sang Yeob is out if it's a tie.)

316
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,880
(Who is the winner of the first match?)

317
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:14,150
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

318
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:15,450
She won.

319
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:17,180
(Ji Hyo wins.)

320
00:11:17,186 --> 00:11:18,420
Ji Hyo won.

321
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:20,050
You get to hit his forehead or pull his sideburns.

322
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:21,860
- You won't slap me on the cheek. - I will hit your forehead.

323
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,020
Give me your forehead.

324
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:24,390
You only need to get hit on the forehead, right?

325
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:25,560
- That's right. - You only need to get hit once.

326
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:26,860
You just need to get hit.

327
00:11:27,596 --> 00:11:29,060
Sang Yeob, I will hit you hard.

328
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:30,530
- I know. - Don't change your expression.

329
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:31,700
(Ji Hyo doesn't go easy on anyone.)

330
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:33,370
- Hurry up, and hit me. - One.

331
00:11:33,836 --> 00:11:35,440
Hurry up, and hit me.

332
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:36,930
Hurry up, and hit...

333
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:38,040
(I am begging you.)

334
00:11:38,474 --> 00:11:39,500
(He's afraid of Ji Hyo.)

335
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:41,010
Okay. Okay.

336
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:42,380
In 1, 2.

337
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,520
- He made a sound. - He made a sound.

338
00:11:50,553 --> 00:11:52,450
- He made a sound. - Sang Yeob is out.

339
00:11:52,655 --> 00:11:54,590
- Sang Yeob is out. - Sang Yeob is out.

340
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,560
Not even a sigh is allowed.

341
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,760
- Look at So Min. - She hit him softly too.

342
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:01,260
Look at So Min.

343
00:12:02,365 --> 00:12:04,360
She wanted to play the game with Sang Yeob.

344
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:05,760
However, he got eliminated right away.

345
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:07,060
(Sang Yeob, why are you there?)

346
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:08,470
She wanted to play the game with Sang Yeob.

347
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:10,440
It's So Min versus Ji Hyo.

348
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,140
- Sang Yeob is out. - I am sorry.

349
00:12:12,141 --> 00:12:13,570
How did this...

350
00:12:13,676 --> 00:12:14,880
Play rock-paper-scissors.

351
00:12:15,177 --> 00:12:16,280
It can't be helped.

352
00:12:16,545 --> 00:12:17,980
Please eliminate me.

353
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,040
Rock-paper-scissors

354
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:21,110
It's a tie.

355
00:12:21,117 --> 00:12:22,850
(So Min is out.)

356
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:25,380
You are out. Go, and talk to Sang Yeob.

357
00:12:25,388 --> 00:12:26,850
(Good for you.)

358
00:12:27,423 --> 00:12:29,220
- Go, and talk to him. - Hello.

359
00:12:29,225 --> 00:12:30,290
Talk to him.

360
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,090
- It worked out. - Talk to him.

361
00:12:32,395 --> 00:12:34,130
Talk to him.

362
00:12:34,563 --> 00:12:36,730
- It's Seok Jin's turn. - Rock-paper-scissors

363
00:12:36,732 --> 00:12:38,700
(Seok Jin loses.)

364
00:12:39,702 --> 00:12:40,970
Rock-paper-scissors

365
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,840
(My goodness.)

366
00:12:42,938 --> 00:12:44,470
- What will it be? - She is good.

367
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:45,770
- What? - What will it be?

368
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:47,940
- Forehead. - Ji Hyo is the best.

369
00:12:47,943 --> 00:12:49,270
- Let's go. - She's good at rock-paper-scissors.

370
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:50,740
It's okay. I can endure the pain.

371
00:12:51,447 --> 00:12:53,280
- Ji Hyo, eliminate him. - Okay.

372
00:12:53,282 --> 00:12:54,780
Ji Hyo might end the game by eliminating everyone.

373
00:12:54,784 --> 00:12:56,450
Don't hit my eyes.

374
00:12:58,721 --> 00:13:00,420
My goodness.

375
00:13:01,123 --> 00:13:03,190
Gosh, why is your hand so plump?

376
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:06,020
- Her hand is so plump. - Don't agitate her.

377
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:07,190
That's right. Receive the blow quietly.

378
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:08,630
- Okay. - He agitated her.

379
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:10,030
I should catch him from behind.

380
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:11,930
Your expression can't change either.

381
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:13,960
(It's a match between Ji Hyo's hand and Seok Jin's forehead.)

382
00:13:13,969 --> 00:13:15,170
Smile.

383
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,810
(The sound is loud and clear.)

384
00:13:22,144 --> 00:13:23,810
(My goodness.)

385
00:13:23,813 --> 00:13:25,240
(He is moved by her slap.)

386
00:13:25,247 --> 00:13:26,310
She did it.

387
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:29,510
She hit Seok Jin harder than Sang Yeob.

388
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:31,780
Are you insane?

389
00:13:31,787 --> 00:13:34,150
- Don't discriminate. - I think...

390
00:13:34,156 --> 00:13:35,850
- I forgot to stay quiet. - I think...

391
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,190
Gwi Hwa...

392
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:40,860
will be slapped like a member despite being a guest.

393
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:41,930
(He'll be slapped like a member.)

394
00:13:43,232 --> 00:13:44,400
Just watch and see.

395
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,160
- Let's do this. - I'm serious.

396
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:47,530
Gwi Hwa will...

397
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:50,600
(He kneels automatically.)

398
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:52,440
Wait, we haven't played the game.

399
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:53,670
No, you haven't.

400
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:55,210
- Let's go. - You can do this.

401
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:57,110
- Gwi Hwa. - Let's go.

402
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:58,380
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

403
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,980
(It's the forehead fairy versus the phlegm fairy.)

404
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:02,580
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

405
00:14:02,952 --> 00:14:05,190
(Ji Hyo wins again.)

406
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:07,620
- Gosh. - What is going on?

407
00:14:07,623 --> 00:14:09,420
- Is this Ji Hyo's game? - What is going on?

408
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,560
- She is the winner. - Seriously.

409
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,590
This will be my facial expression.

410
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:15,360
You look like Joker.

411
00:14:15,364 --> 00:14:16,560
(Joker with bad bronchial tubes)

412
00:14:16,966 --> 00:14:18,330
I am sorry.

413
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:19,700
My goodness.

414
00:14:23,038 --> 00:14:25,740
(Groaning)

415
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:28,610
(The phlegm fairy is knocked down.)

416
00:14:29,145 --> 00:14:31,780
How many casualties must we have before this game ends?

417
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,350
I couldn't help but make a sound.

418
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:35,550
I am already scared.

419
00:14:35,818 --> 00:14:37,480
- Seriously. - You need to beat her.

420
00:14:37,486 --> 00:14:38,650
You need to beat her in rock-paper-scissors.

421
00:14:38,654 --> 00:14:40,750
Ji Hyo eliminated so many people.

422
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:42,350
You need to beat her in rock-paper-scissors.

423
00:14:42,358 --> 00:14:43,650
If you win, the direction changes.

424
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:45,860
- If you win, the direction changes. - That's right.

425
00:14:45,861 --> 00:14:47,430
If you win, the direction changes.

426
00:14:47,963 --> 00:14:49,290
It's Jong Kook.

427
00:14:49,298 --> 00:14:50,660
Ji Hyo is impressive.

428
00:14:51,534 --> 00:14:53,330
- Let's go, Ji Hyo. - Rock-paper-scissors

429
00:14:53,335 --> 00:14:54,840
(It's a rock-paper-scissors match between the two ace members.)

430
00:14:55,337 --> 00:14:56,740
Rock-paper-scissors

431
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,070
(Ji Hyo wins again.)

432
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:00,870
What is going on?

433
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:02,610
- I don't understand. - I planned to play scissors.

434
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:03,810
Why did I play rock?

435
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:06,680
(How impressive can Ji Hyo get?)

436
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,380
Is it the effect of the witch's coat?

437
00:15:09,585 --> 00:15:11,950
- She is a mind reader. - She looks like a witch.

438
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,550
- She is getting ready. - This is a disaster.

439
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:15,450
Jong Kook won't make a sound.

440
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:16,550
If Jong Kook endures in silence,

441
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,690
Jong Kook will challenge Se Chan.

442
00:15:18,694 --> 00:15:20,790
- He will endure in silence. - That's right.

443
00:15:21,063 --> 00:15:23,230
I think he'll definitely endure it.

444
00:15:23,265 --> 00:15:24,460
- Jong Kook... - I'm so curious.

445
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:25,530
(Jong Kook is good at enduring pain.)

446
00:15:25,534 --> 00:15:28,230
- Gosh. - Her hand is at its best now.

447
00:15:28,237 --> 00:15:30,670
- It's hard not to scream. - The sound is so scary.

448
00:15:30,673 --> 00:15:32,770
Right. You can't help screaming.

449
00:15:35,311 --> 00:15:37,370
(Will Ji Hyo win for the 5th time in a row?)

450
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:40,710
(Will Jong Kook succeed to the throne?)

451
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:42,980
(What will be the result?)

452
00:15:44,353 --> 00:15:45,420
(Groaning)

453
00:15:47,056 --> 00:15:49,060
(Groaning)

454
00:15:50,793 --> 00:15:53,230
(Jong Kook has fallen.)

455
00:15:53,796 --> 00:15:55,760
(The audience is exhilarated.)

456
00:15:55,764 --> 00:15:59,100
Good job. That was nice.

457
00:15:59,101 --> 00:16:00,500
(I'm sorry.)

458
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,270
- Nice. - That was a nice one.

459
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:06,400
- It was nice. - It really hurts.

460
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:07,980
Jong Kook lost!

461
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,210
Jong Kook wasn't in pain. He was annoyed.

462
00:16:12,214 --> 00:16:14,680
Jong Kook is angry?

463
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,650
He endured the pain, but not his anger.

464
00:16:16,652 --> 00:16:18,620
- He's angry. - The sound was so clear.

465
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:20,420
- It was incredible. - The sound...

466
00:16:20,422 --> 00:16:21,890
Ji Hyo is killing us all.

467
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,090
What is this?

468
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,390
She's killing us all.

469
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:25,620
Hold on.

470
00:16:25,628 --> 00:16:27,560
It sounded like the air was compressed.

471
00:16:27,563 --> 00:16:29,430
- It sounded so clear. - Exactly.

472
00:16:29,765 --> 00:16:30,760
Ji Hyo is so good.

473
00:16:30,766 --> 00:16:33,700
Look at all these people. You have to win rock-paper-scissors.

474
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,230
If Se Chan wins, the direction will change.

475
00:16:35,237 --> 00:16:38,940
Rock-paper-scissors

476
00:16:38,941 --> 00:16:40,440
(Ji Hyo's hand has warmed up. You have to win.)

477
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:42,680
(What will happen to Se Chan?)

478
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:44,940
Okay!

479
00:16:44,947 --> 00:16:46,450
(Ji Hyo finally loses.)

480
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,510
(Ji Hyo loses after winning 6 times.)

481
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:50,120
Se Chan is very strong.

482
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:51,950
- Me? - Play rock-paper-scissors.

483
00:16:51,954 --> 00:16:54,020
- I think Ji Hyo will endure it. - Se Chan is strong.

484
00:16:54,023 --> 00:16:55,690
- Se Chan... - Ji Hyo, endure it.

485
00:16:55,691 --> 00:16:56,790
(If Ji Hyo endures it, her next opponent is Haha.)

486
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:58,360
- Ji Hyo, endure it. - Se Chan.

487
00:16:58,827 --> 00:17:00,060
- Endure it. - You can do this.

488
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:02,500
Ji Hyo, kill them all.

489
00:17:02,798 --> 00:17:03,830
Here we go.

490
00:17:03,832 --> 00:17:06,700
(Se Chan is not afraid of anything.)

491
00:17:06,702 --> 00:17:10,400
(Will Se Chan be able to beat Ji Hyo?)

492
00:17:15,311 --> 00:17:16,370
Ji Hyo!

493
00:17:16,378 --> 00:17:17,880
(Slapping)

494
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:19,640
Are you okay?

495
00:17:19,648 --> 00:17:21,620
(Why you little...)

496
00:17:22,851 --> 00:17:25,520
- He hit her hard! - She just swore!

497
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:27,960
She swore.

498
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:29,350
(Se Chan's slap made her swear.)

499
00:17:29,358 --> 00:17:32,090
- It's true. - She endured it, didn't she?

500
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:34,330
It's Ji Hyo's turn to attack Haha.

501
00:17:34,496 --> 00:17:36,730
- She endured it. - She endured it.

502
00:17:36,732 --> 00:17:38,260
Ji Hyo is so strong.

503
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:39,700
- She endured it. - She's amazing.

504
00:17:39,702 --> 00:17:42,330
Ji Hyo, take it out on Haha.

505
00:17:42,338 --> 00:17:44,200
- Yes. - But she has to win first.

506
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:47,740
(It's finally my turn.)

507
00:17:47,843 --> 00:17:51,640
(Haha has been waiting for his turn quietly.)

508
00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:53,910
(I'll stop Ji Hyo!)

509
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,650
He looks so weak.

510
00:17:56,685 --> 00:17:58,450
- Let's do this. - He looks so weak.

511
00:17:58,454 --> 00:17:59,850
(Ji Hyo is angry, and Haha has been waiting for this moment.)

512
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:01,120
(Who will win?)

513
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,360
Rock-paper-scissors

514
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,360
- It's a tie. - Haha lost.

515
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:08,600
Move.

516
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:11,870
(What?)

517
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:14,500
(Haha gets eliminated right away.)

518
00:18:14,503 --> 00:18:15,670
- Move. - It's so disappointing.

519
00:18:15,671 --> 00:18:16,930
- Move. - Get out.

520
00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:18,840
- I waited so long. - It's over.

521
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:20,140
Move.

522
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,340
Let me get hit at least.

523
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:22,410
- No. - It's over.

524
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:24,310
- Move. - Haha.

525
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,750
He has pickled radish on his eyes.

526
00:18:28,117 --> 00:18:29,920
Ji Hyo is really good at this.

527
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:31,880
It's Sung Tae's turn.

528
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:33,390
- It's hilarious. - She's amazing.

529
00:18:33,922 --> 00:18:36,290
- Ji Hyo is amazing. - I'm looking forward to this round.

530
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,490
Will Ji Hyo kill us all?

531
00:18:38,727 --> 00:18:40,190
- She's unbelievable. - Gosh.

532
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:41,890
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

533
00:18:41,897 --> 00:18:43,360
(Sung Tae has been quietly watching.)

534
00:18:43,432 --> 00:18:46,130
(Who will win?)

535
00:18:47,035 --> 00:18:49,570
(Sung Tae wins.)

536
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:51,810
- You can hit her. - But...

537
00:18:51,874 --> 00:18:54,480
- you can pull her sideburns too. - You can.

538
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:55,640
- You can do that too. - Should I just pull her sideburns?

539
00:18:55,644 --> 00:18:57,140
You can pull her sideburns.

540
00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:58,610
How long do you have to endure the pain?

541
00:18:58,614 --> 00:18:59,640
For 5 seconds.

542
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:00,910
- For 5 seconds. - For 5 seconds?

543
00:19:04,086 --> 00:19:05,190
I think she'll endure it.

544
00:19:05,254 --> 00:19:06,280
Downwards?

545
00:19:06,288 --> 00:19:09,450
(Ji Hyo, it's going to hurt a bit.)

546
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,360
- We haven't started yet. - He has to say "start" first.

547
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,460
(What are you doing?)

548
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:15,330
(Oh, my. I'm sorry.)

549
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:17,960
- You're mean. - What did you do?

550
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:19,430
- You should pull it upwards. - I'm sorry.

551
00:19:19,435 --> 00:19:20,700
- Pull it upwards. - I'm sorry.

552
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,070
Wait until it starts.

553
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,470
Sung Tae is having fun.

554
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,540
- Pull it upwards. - Pull it upwards.

555
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:29,310
He looks like a villain right now.

556
00:19:29,311 --> 00:19:31,540
(He's mean when playing games, too.)

557
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,850
Say, "start". Then we'll count.

558
00:19:33,982 --> 00:19:35,650
1, 2, start.

559
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:38,550
1, 2, 3,

560
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:40,280
- Four... - Is she enduring it?

561
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:41,420
(Amazed)

562
00:19:41,623 --> 00:19:44,090
(If Ji Hyo endures it, her next opponent will be Se Chan again.)

563
00:19:44,092 --> 00:19:45,420
He'll pull out her hair.

564
00:19:45,427 --> 00:19:48,500
(Ji Hyo endured the pain.)

565
00:19:48,664 --> 00:19:50,460
- How can she do this? - She's incredible.

566
00:19:50,466 --> 00:19:52,300
Ji Hyo, take it easy.

567
00:19:53,168 --> 00:19:54,360
(This situation is...)

568
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:56,930
(a nightmare to someone.)

569
00:19:56,939 --> 00:20:00,040
(I'm doomed.)

570
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:02,370
- You can say it hurts. - Is it Bo Gyeol's turn?

571
00:20:02,377 --> 00:20:04,910
No. It's Se Chan's turn. The direction has changed.

572
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:09,150
(I knew this was coming,)

573
00:20:09,151 --> 00:20:12,190
(but I didn't expect it so soon.)

574
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:16,020
(Se Chan, I've been waiting.)

575
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:18,460
- Rock-paper-scissors. - I'm doomed if I lose.

576
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,190
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Did you get stung by a bee?

577
00:20:20,195 --> 00:20:22,130
You're doomed if you lose.

578
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,560
Ji Hyo is furious.

579
00:20:23,565 --> 00:20:25,100
- The best scenario is... - Hey.

580
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,170
- that it becomes a tie. - You might die if you lose.

581
00:20:27,402 --> 00:20:29,300
You might die if she hits you now.

582
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:30,540
Everyone.

583
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:33,140
Look Bo Gyeol's face.

584
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:36,670
- Her eyes are wandering. - She doesn't know where to look.

585
00:20:36,678 --> 00:20:37,710
(The intensity is overwhelming.)

586
00:20:37,713 --> 00:20:39,810
(Culture shock)

587
00:20:39,815 --> 00:20:42,250
It's her turn soon.

588
00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:43,880
She must be so nervous.

589
00:20:43,886 --> 00:20:45,090
(It's her first game on her first variety show.)

590
00:20:45,187 --> 00:20:46,620
I'll win 1,000 dollars.

591
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:48,890
- Do it, Ji Hyo. - She's determined.

592
00:20:48,891 --> 00:20:50,090
Survive, Se Chan.

593
00:20:50,092 --> 00:20:52,020
- I want a tie. - Don't see it.

594
00:20:52,027 --> 00:20:53,620
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

595
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:54,860
(It has to be a tie.)

596
00:20:54,863 --> 00:20:58,030
(Will Ji Hyo get her revenge, or will Se Chan escape it?)

597
00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:00,970
(What will happen?)

598
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,700
It's a tie.

599
00:21:03,705 --> 00:21:05,070
(Se Chan is eliminated.)

600
00:21:05,073 --> 00:21:07,610
(Thank goodness I'm eliminated.)

601
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:09,170
Ji Hyo...

602
00:21:09,177 --> 00:21:10,440
(Annoyed)

603
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:11,980
(He couldn't be happier.)

604
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,180
I'm so happy. Jong Kook...

605
00:21:14,216 --> 00:21:15,650
He's so happy he's eliminated.

606
00:21:16,685 --> 00:21:18,180
My legs are failing me.

607
00:21:18,186 --> 00:21:19,250
- My legs are failing me. - Good job.

608
00:21:19,254 --> 00:21:20,750
Ji Hyo is so annoyed.

609
00:21:20,756 --> 00:21:22,290
You got revenge on her for me.

610
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:24,390
What will Bo Gyeol do?

611
00:21:24,393 --> 00:21:26,490
It's Bo Gyeol's turn.

612
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:28,660
- Now... - It's Bo Gyeol's turn now.

613
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:30,630
Ji Hyo will take it all out...

614
00:21:30,632 --> 00:21:31,960
- on her. - Exactly.

615
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:33,760
- She's going to explode. - Bo Gyeol, you just wait.

616
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:34,830
(You just wait.)

617
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,500
- Bo Gyeol. - My goodness.

618
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:38,370
- She should've gone first. - She looks so worried.

619
00:21:38,373 --> 00:21:39,740
This is her first variety show.

620
00:21:39,741 --> 00:21:41,540
- Bo Gyeol might win. - From the beginning...

621
00:21:41,543 --> 00:21:43,110
She's going through hazing.

622
00:21:43,111 --> 00:21:44,140
Rock-paper-scissors

623
00:21:44,146 --> 00:21:47,280
(Will Bo Gyeol overcome this situation?)

624
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,450
Rock-paper-scissors

625
00:21:49,451 --> 00:21:51,150
(Ji Hyo wins.)

626
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:53,650
(What did I do?)

627
00:21:53,655 --> 00:21:55,990
- It's so harsh. - Hit her forehead.

628
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:57,490
- Hit her forehead. - Should I hit her forehead?

629
00:21:57,492 --> 00:21:58,960
- Hit her forehead. - Yes.

630
00:21:58,961 --> 00:22:00,590
Just don't scream.

631
00:22:00,596 --> 00:22:02,130
She shouldn't frown or scream.

632
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,030
Please let me watch this.

633
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,100
(Haha comes to the front.)

634
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:06,900
You've never done this, have you?

635
00:22:06,902 --> 00:22:07,970
No.

636
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,900
- You've only seen it on TV, right? - Yes.

637
00:22:10,272 --> 00:22:12,010
Don't cry.

638
00:22:12,441 --> 00:22:13,840
Don't tell your mom.

639
00:22:13,842 --> 00:22:16,040
- Don't call your manager. - Don't call your manager.

640
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:18,210
Just endure it.

641
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:19,710
Ready.

642
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:21,110
You'll probably never do a scene like this in a drama.

643
00:22:21,116 --> 00:22:22,880
- Imagine you're getting a shot. - Go.

644
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,380
- I'll support her. - Here we go.

645
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:25,750
- Don't cry. - Don't.

646
00:22:25,754 --> 00:22:27,490
- Go. - She's already crying.

647
00:22:31,793 --> 00:22:33,760
She hit her.

648
00:22:33,762 --> 00:22:35,300
She just hit her.

649
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:37,690
- I'm sorry. - Are you okay?

650
00:22:37,699 --> 00:22:39,200
I didn't want to hurt her.

651
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:40,930
She's crying.

652
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:42,070
I'm okay.

653
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,970
- I heard something crack. - It was a mistake.

654
00:22:43,972 --> 00:22:45,640
It's really okay.

655
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:47,610
- Bo Gyeol, you lost. - Okay.

656
00:22:48,844 --> 00:22:50,540
Did she make a sound?

657
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:51,910
- Yes. - She made a sound?

658
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:53,350
I couldn't help it.

659
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:55,450
I'm sorry.

660
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,810
(It was a mistake.)

661
00:22:56,818 --> 00:22:59,080
Unfortunately, Bo Gyeol lost.

662
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,420
I might beat her in rock-paper-scissors.

663
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:02,950
- Then the direction will change. - By the way,

664
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,260
will Ji Hyo kill us all today?

665
00:23:04,326 --> 00:23:05,730
She's amazing.

666
00:23:05,894 --> 00:23:07,490
You know, right?

667
00:23:07,496 --> 00:23:09,330
- Of course. - It's going to hurt.

668
00:23:09,331 --> 00:23:10,890
Jae Seok is good at it.

669
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:12,470
- He's strong. - He is.

670
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:14,230
Gosh.

671
00:23:14,236 --> 00:23:15,370
(I've been waiting for this moment.)

672
00:23:15,404 --> 00:23:16,830
Rock-paper-scissors

673
00:23:16,838 --> 00:23:19,410
(Ji Hyo is ready to kill them all. Jae Seok has been waiting for this.)

674
00:23:21,476 --> 00:23:23,540
(Jae Seok wins.)

675
00:23:24,212 --> 00:23:26,750
(It's finally time.)

676
00:23:26,848 --> 00:23:28,480
It's the goblin versus the witch.

677
00:23:28,483 --> 00:23:30,420
- Should you pull her sideburns? - Should you pull her sideburns?

678
00:23:30,485 --> 00:23:33,090
- Should I? - Just slap her forehead.

679
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:34,480
That's your specialty.

680
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:37,020
Ji Hyo should understand.

681
00:23:37,025 --> 00:23:38,590
- Sure. - Considering...

682
00:23:38,593 --> 00:23:40,030
- my situation... - We could...

683
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,360
- On the count of three? - just stop here.

684
00:23:41,363 --> 00:23:42,860
- When are you going to hit me? - We could stop here.

685
00:23:42,931 --> 00:23:44,290
- On the count of 3. - On the count of 3?

686
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:45,700
- Okay. - He might hit you on two.

687
00:23:45,701 --> 00:23:46,970
(He's ready.)

688
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:53,210
(Jae Seok has been feeling jealous of Ji Hyo's winning streak.)

689
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:54,940
(After a long wait,)

690
00:23:54,943 --> 00:23:56,670
(this is his chance to show off his skills.)

691
00:23:56,678 --> 00:23:57,740
He'll hit her on the count of one.

692
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,050
What?

693
00:24:00,515 --> 00:24:02,180
(Screaming)

694
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:03,850
I screamed.

695
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:06,150
- She's eliminated. - I screamed.

696
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:07,280
She's eliminated.

697
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:08,590
I screamed.

698
00:24:08,623 --> 00:24:10,290
- It's over now. - It must be frustrating.

699
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:11,620
It must be...

700
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:12,860
You win.

701
00:24:12,894 --> 00:24:14,830
- It's over. She screamed. - What is she doing?

702
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,700
- She screamed. - I didn't even hit you.

703
00:24:16,732 --> 00:24:18,060
She screamed.

704
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,000
Ji Hyo, gosh.

705
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,360
- She screamed. - I didn't hit her.

706
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:23,300
- She screamed. - It must be so frustrating.

707
00:24:23,305 --> 00:24:24,600
(Annoyed)

708
00:24:24,606 --> 00:24:26,210
She's a genius.

709
00:24:26,274 --> 00:24:28,680
- I can't believe this. - She's a genius.

710
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:29,980
Are you okay?

711
00:24:31,413 --> 00:24:32,810
Hold on.

712
00:24:32,814 --> 00:24:34,310
- Jae Seok might become the winner. - If I win...

713
00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:36,350
If it's a tie, or if Jae Seok makes him scream, he'll win.

714
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,380
If it's a tie, Jae Seok will be the winner.

715
00:24:38,386 --> 00:24:39,650
These two...

716
00:24:39,654 --> 00:24:41,090
- If he wins... - It's going to be fierce.

717
00:24:41,456 --> 00:24:42,520
All right.

718
00:24:43,091 --> 00:24:44,190
Rock...

719
00:24:45,627 --> 00:24:46,820
Rock-paper-scissors

720
00:24:46,828 --> 00:24:48,930
(This will determine the winner.)

721
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,330
(Who will win the chance to hit the other?)

722
00:24:52,968 --> 00:24:54,660
Rock-paper-scissors

723
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:57,800
(Jae Seok wins.)

724
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:00,940
- Just endure it. - My forehead?

725
00:25:00,942 --> 00:25:02,280
- Okay. - Your forehead.

726
00:25:02,744 --> 00:25:03,940
Hit his forehead.

727
00:25:04,346 --> 00:25:07,450
- Kwang Soo. - This is the final. I must endure.

728
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:09,880
You have to endure it.

729
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:11,180
- It's the final round. - You can win 1,000 dollars.

730
00:25:11,186 --> 00:25:13,050
- It's worth it. - Of course.

731
00:25:13,088 --> 00:25:14,590
If I endure this one time, I'll win 1,000 dollars.

732
00:25:14,623 --> 00:25:17,020
- If he endures it... - Like this.

733
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:19,190
Okay.

734
00:25:19,694 --> 00:25:21,930
Jump before you hit him.

735
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,090
(Culture shock)

736
00:25:23,098 --> 00:25:24,160
All right.

737
00:25:24,499 --> 00:25:27,030
- Let's go. - I'll make your hand hurt more.

738
00:25:27,035 --> 00:25:28,770
Do it. The forehead is stronger.

739
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,700
Kwang Soo, you can endure it.

740
00:25:30,705 --> 00:25:33,040
- Just do it once. - I'll endure it no matter what.

741
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:36,840
My goodness.

742
00:25:36,845 --> 00:25:38,210
(He falls back.)

743
00:25:38,213 --> 00:25:40,710
- Wait, didn't he get hit? - No.

744
00:25:40,715 --> 00:25:42,920
(Isn't it considered a hit?)

745
00:25:43,018 --> 00:25:45,120
Were you hit by the wind?

746
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,080
Kwang Soo feels pressured.

747
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:48,290
(Sighing)

748
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,420
Fear defeated him.

749
00:25:49,891 --> 00:25:51,720
- Kwang Soo. - You can do it, Kwang Soo.

750
00:25:51,726 --> 00:25:54,220
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo face each other in the final round.)

751
00:25:54,229 --> 00:25:57,360
(If Kwang Soo endures once, he gets a chance to attack.)

752
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:01,430
(Will he endure Jae Seok's attack?)

753
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:05,640
His expression changed.

754
00:26:07,742 --> 00:26:09,810
(Surprised)

755
00:26:11,213 --> 00:26:13,580
(He attacks his sideburns instead.)

756
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:17,280
(What happened?)

757
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,180
Is that what you did?

758
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:22,320
(While everyone was focusing on his forehead, I saw his sideburns.)

759
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,020
That was great.

760
00:26:24,192 --> 00:26:25,790
- Good job. - I win 1,000 dollars.

761
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:27,290
- He made a surprise attack. - What?

762
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:28,360
It was a surprise attack.

763
00:26:28,363 --> 00:26:30,930
His forehead was prepared, but he pulled his sideburns.

764
00:26:30,932 --> 00:26:33,330
(Jae Seok wins the first mission.)

765
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:37,300
The result of the first mission is...

766
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:39,870
- Jae Seok places first. - I admit that it was good.

767
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:40,940
Congratulations.

768
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:43,270
He should thank Ji Hyo.

769
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:45,680
- It was thanks to Ji Hyo. - That's right.

770
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,310
He won mostly because of Ji Hyo.

771
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:49,110
She handed the victory to you.

772
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:52,650
Jae Seok will receive a prize of 1,000 dollars.

773
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:53,750
Immediately?

774
00:26:54,389 --> 00:26:55,690
- Immediately? - Right now?

775
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,690
(Hyeong Sun hands him the prize.)

776
00:26:56,691 --> 00:26:58,330
- Will he receive immediately? - I see.

777
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,290
- What? - What's going on?

778
00:27:00,295 --> 00:27:02,100
(She collapses to the ground.)

779
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:04,630
(The assistant director...)

780
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:05,730
Hey.

781
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,340
(The assistant director collapses.)

782
00:27:08,603 --> 00:27:09,930
- What's wrong? - Hey.

783
00:27:09,938 --> 00:27:11,700
- Hey. - She's pretending.

784
00:27:11,706 --> 00:27:13,300
- This is wrong. - How could you?

785
00:27:13,308 --> 00:27:15,210
- What's going on? - Stay away.

786
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,110
- She's pretending. - What's going on?

787
00:27:17,112 --> 00:27:18,840
- What? - What's happening?

788
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:21,510
- What is she doing? - What's going on?

789
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:23,280
What are you doing, Hyeong Sun?

790
00:27:23,285 --> 00:27:24,980
- She's smiling. - Hyeong Sun.

791
00:27:24,986 --> 00:27:27,720
- She's smiling. - What's wrong with you?

792
00:27:27,722 --> 00:27:29,720
- What happened? - Hyeong Sun collapsed.

793
00:27:29,724 --> 00:27:32,690
Here is today's real race.

794
00:27:32,994 --> 00:27:35,090
It's called Bad Guys...

795
00:27:35,096 --> 00:27:36,960
- War Against the Villain. - The villain?

796
00:27:36,965 --> 00:27:40,470
There are 2 villains among you who stole 3,000 dollars...

797
00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:42,970
and eliminated the assistant director.

798
00:27:43,305 --> 00:27:45,870
There are two detectives who are after the villains.

799
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:49,010
There's one person who can has evidence that identifies...

800
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,540
- the villains. - Among us?

801
00:27:50,845 --> 00:27:52,310
Can she leave first?

802
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,880
- Leave her alone. - Hyeong Sun.

803
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:55,080
Are you okay?

804
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:56,710
Is this why you did your hair today?

805
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,280
This is the crime scene.

806
00:27:58,286 --> 00:27:59,620
This is it.

807
00:27:59,621 --> 00:28:01,690
The member who wins the mission...

808
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,090
will be given hints.

809
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:05,360
If all of the villains are eliminated in the final race,

810
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,790
the detectives and the citizens will win.

811
00:28:06,795 --> 00:28:10,390
The villains and detectives were informed about the situation.

812
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:12,830
(The villains and detectives were already informed?)

813
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:15,370
They're among us.

814
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,400
(They were informed.)

815
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:18,240
There are villains and detectives.

816
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,010
If one of the villains survives,

817
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,640
the villain team will win.

818
00:28:23,645 --> 00:28:27,010
The winning team wins a prize of 3,000 dollars.

819
00:28:27,015 --> 00:28:29,950
Wait, so does this mean this game was meaningless?

820
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:31,280
- That's right. - Give me my prize.

821
00:28:31,286 --> 00:28:32,890
- I got hit. - Does he get a hint?

822
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:35,390
Jae Seok, who won the mission,

823
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:38,250
will receive two hints instead of the prize.

824
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:39,960
- That's a lot. - Please step forward.

825
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:42,090
Give me 1,000 dollars instead.

826
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:43,190
(He wants the money instead.)

827
00:28:43,198 --> 00:28:44,190
It's stolen.

828
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:46,430
I already got hit.

829
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:49,400
Only you get to look at it.

830
00:28:49,404 --> 00:28:51,570
(He gets a hint about the villains and the witness.)

831
00:28:51,873 --> 00:28:55,110
(The hint is important for today's win.)

832
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,210
Come on.

833
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,140
(The witness is an actor.)

834
00:29:00,148 --> 00:29:01,810
(Kwang Soo, Ji Hyo, So Min, Bo Gyeol, Gwi Hwa, Sung Tae, Sang Yeob)

835
00:29:01,816 --> 00:29:03,580
- Gosh. - Is it a hint about the detectives?

836
00:29:03,585 --> 00:29:05,650
It doesn't make any sense.

837
00:29:05,653 --> 00:29:07,350
- How could you? - He got hit so much.

838
00:29:07,355 --> 00:29:09,160
(The villains have appeared in movies.)

839
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:10,450
(Se Chan isn't a villain.)

840
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,860
(The witness is one of the actors.)

841
00:29:12,861 --> 00:29:15,930
(Will they catch the villains?)

842
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:19,900
We have a lot of people today. Let me think.

843
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:21,200
- How many are we? - There are 12 of us.

844
00:29:21,202 --> 00:29:22,200
That's so many.

845
00:29:22,203 --> 00:29:24,100
- This is incredible. - We're like Super Junior.

846
00:29:24,105 --> 00:29:25,340
By the way,

847
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,610
why are Gwi Hwa and Sung Tae sitting next to each other?

848
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,610
Pardon?

849
00:29:29,611 --> 00:29:32,150
Are you conspiring in the back?

850
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,110
- I knew it. - They're trying to conspire.

851
00:29:34,115 --> 00:29:35,820
- Don't do that. - Are you the villains?

852
00:29:36,584 --> 00:29:38,050
Which role do you play today?

853
00:29:38,286 --> 00:29:40,450
I'm just the audience.

854
00:29:40,455 --> 00:29:42,250
(He simply watches what's going on.)

855
00:29:42,257 --> 00:29:44,360
- I'm the audience. - Here's what's important.

856
00:29:44,893 --> 00:29:47,390
- Kwang Soo is one of the villains. - No.

857
00:29:47,395 --> 00:29:49,390
(Kwang Soo is one of the villains.)

858
00:29:49,397 --> 00:29:50,630
(He's always a suspect.)

859
00:29:50,632 --> 00:29:52,500
Why did you do that yesterday?

860
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,930
Do you remember last night?

861
00:29:53,935 --> 00:29:56,200
- You mean what he said? - I don't know if it was filmed.

862
00:29:56,204 --> 00:29:58,200
Last night, I asked if we started at 9am today,

863
00:29:58,206 --> 00:29:59,400
and he started to say it started at 7am.

864
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:01,110
- He said his call time was 7am. - Then he stopped himself.

865
00:30:01,409 --> 00:30:03,410
It's because I thought...

866
00:30:03,411 --> 00:30:04,410
our call time was at 7am.

867
00:30:04,412 --> 00:30:06,140
Forget it.

868
00:30:06,147 --> 00:30:08,680
I think we identified one of the villains.

869
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:10,850
- What do you mean? - What about the witness?

870
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:13,820
Next mission is a group mission.

871
00:30:14,089 --> 00:30:15,250
If you succeed,

872
00:30:15,256 --> 00:30:19,490
everyone will receive a hint about the villains.

873
00:30:19,494 --> 00:30:20,790
Here's the next mission.

874
00:30:21,096 --> 00:30:22,590
It's called Subtract, Not Multiply.

875
00:30:22,597 --> 00:30:24,930
(Subtract, Not Multiply)

876
00:30:24,933 --> 00:30:26,030
(Subtract the 2nd number from the 1st.)

877
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:28,300
- That's easy. - For example, 3 by 6 is...

878
00:30:28,303 --> 00:30:30,400
- Negative 3. - We have to subtract.

879
00:30:30,405 --> 00:30:32,570
In these games, the villains will try to get it wrong.

880
00:30:32,574 --> 00:30:34,740
Whoever gets it wrong is a villain.

881
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,510
We'll start from Ji Hyo,

882
00:30:37,512 --> 00:30:40,110
So Min, Seok Jin, Jong Kook,

883
00:30:40,115 --> 00:30:42,380
- Bo Gyeol and end with Sung Tae. - Ji Hyo.

884
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,980
Ji Hyo is terrible at this game.

885
00:30:45,987 --> 00:30:46,980
Let's start.

886
00:30:46,988 --> 00:30:49,820
(Subtract, Not Multiply starts.)

887
00:30:50,658 --> 00:30:52,090
- Subtract, Not Multiply - Subtract, Not Multiply

888
00:30:52,093 --> 00:30:53,860
- 6 minus 5. - 5.

889
00:30:55,663 --> 00:30:56,690
Wrong.

890
00:30:56,698 --> 00:30:58,260
(Isn't it one?)

891
00:30:58,266 --> 00:31:00,460
- That's wrong. - It's one.

892
00:31:00,468 --> 00:31:01,500
I told you.

893
00:31:01,503 --> 00:31:03,500
- Ji Hyo is terrible with numbers. - How could you get it wrong?

894
00:31:03,505 --> 00:31:05,470
- This was too easy. - I know.

895
00:31:05,473 --> 00:31:07,540
Don't I multiply and subtract the first number?

896
00:31:07,942 --> 00:31:09,840
- No. - Do I simply subtract?

897
00:31:09,844 --> 00:31:11,110
- Yes. - I got it.

898
00:31:11,112 --> 00:31:12,280
- Ji Hyo. - I'm sorry.

899
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,480
I misunderstood.

900
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:14,610
(She gets another chance.)

901
00:31:14,616 --> 00:31:17,010
Let's start over.

902
00:31:17,018 --> 00:31:19,420
(They restart the game after understanding the rule.)

903
00:31:20,121 --> 00:31:21,960
- 6 by 5. - 5.

904
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:24,850
It's one.

905
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:29,930
(She definitely said that she understood the rule.)

906
00:31:30,565 --> 00:31:32,300
- Listen. - Just give up.

907
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,730
- What did she say? - Wait.

908
00:31:34,736 --> 00:31:36,830
Let's hear why her answer was five.

909
00:31:36,838 --> 00:31:39,540
- How did you calculate? - Why is it five?

910
00:31:39,574 --> 00:31:41,770
I only heard the last number. I'm sorry.

911
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:43,510
She's quite stubborn.

912
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:44,610
(Instead of stubborn Ji Hyo...)

913
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:46,280
- Let's start with So Min. - So Min should start.

914
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:47,410
Come on.

915
00:31:47,415 --> 00:31:49,880
- Let's go. Subtract, Not Multiply - Subtract, Not Multiply

916
00:31:49,884 --> 00:31:52,480
- Subtract, Not Multiply - 3 minus 3.

917
00:31:52,487 --> 00:31:53,980
- 0. - 6 minus 5.

918
00:31:53,988 --> 00:31:55,860
- 1. - 2 minus 4.

919
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,690
- Negative 2. - 3 minus 5.

920
00:31:58,593 --> 00:32:01,160
(Next is Ji Hyo, who is terrible with numbers.)

921
00:32:03,198 --> 00:32:04,500
Three.

922
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:07,500
- What? - Why?

923
00:32:07,502 --> 00:32:08,700
(How did she get 3?)

924
00:32:08,703 --> 00:32:10,100
Why?

925
00:32:10,104 --> 00:32:11,700
Why is it 3?

926
00:32:11,706 --> 00:32:15,310
- Ji Hyo, you're the main guest. - She only heard three.

927
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,570
You're the main guest.

928
00:32:16,578 --> 00:32:18,280
Are you a villain?

929
00:32:18,513 --> 00:32:20,480
I hope you're a villain.

930
00:32:20,882 --> 00:32:22,050
I hope so.

931
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:25,350
Please, I hope she's a villain.

932
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,520
Why can't I do it?

933
00:32:28,523 --> 00:32:30,350
- All right. - What can we do it?

934
00:32:30,358 --> 00:32:32,860
Let's start with Sung Tae and end with Ji Hyo.

935
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,390
- Okay. - I got it.

936
00:32:34,395 --> 00:32:35,800
- This is incredible. - I got it.

937
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,360
Let's start with Sung Tae.

938
00:32:37,365 --> 00:32:39,730
(Subtract, Not Multiply starts.)

939
00:32:40,568 --> 00:32:42,500
- 7 minus 5. - 2.

940
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:46,470
- 3 minus 5. - Negative 3.

941
00:32:46,474 --> 00:32:47,600
Negative three.

942
00:32:47,609 --> 00:32:49,040
(How did he calculate that?)

943
00:32:49,043 --> 00:32:50,310
This is impossible.

944
00:32:50,578 --> 00:32:52,410
This is impossible.

945
00:32:52,413 --> 00:32:55,850
- I'm similar to Ji Hyo. - Do you understand the rule?

946
00:32:55,984 --> 00:32:57,910
- Let's start over. - I'm bad with numbers.

947
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,080
(He gets another chance.)

948
00:32:59,087 --> 00:33:00,120
Let's start with Sung Tae.

949
00:33:00,121 --> 00:33:02,020
(He gets another chance.)

950
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:03,390
Subtract, Not Multiply

951
00:33:03,391 --> 00:33:04,490
6 minus 5.

952
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:06,360
- 1. - 7 minus 5.

953
00:33:06,661 --> 00:33:08,800
Negative two.

954
00:33:09,197 --> 00:33:10,660
- The answer is two. - Goodness.

955
00:33:10,665 --> 00:33:12,000
- Isn't it 7 minus 5? - He's a villain.

956
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,170
- It's 2. - It's positive 2.

957
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:16,870
Ji Hyo, you got lucky.

958
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:19,270
- Ji Hyo, you're laughing a lot. - You got lucky.

959
00:33:19,274 --> 00:33:21,510
She's not the only one thanks to Gwi Hwa.

960
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:25,010
This game is usually fun, but it's really boring.

961
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,940
We can't continue.

962
00:33:26,948 --> 00:33:28,310
- Then... - When will we get to play?

963
00:33:28,316 --> 00:33:29,780
- Let's start with Bo Gyeol. - Start with Bo Gyeol.

964
00:33:29,784 --> 00:33:30,850
Is this the real game?

965
00:33:30,852 --> 00:33:32,480
- Yes. - It's for real.

966
00:33:32,487 --> 00:33:34,480
- Let's start. - What's going on here?

967
00:33:34,489 --> 00:33:36,660
There are about 8 spies.

968
00:33:37,825 --> 00:33:39,290
We stop after three members.

969
00:33:39,294 --> 00:33:41,190
Let's go. Subtract, Not Multiply

970
00:33:41,195 --> 00:33:42,790
- Subtract, Not Multiply - Subtract, Not Multiply

971
00:33:42,797 --> 00:33:44,260
- 7 minus 5. - 2.

972
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,900
- 2 minus 4. - Negative 2.

973
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,970
3 minus 5.

974
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:51,270
(Will Gwi Hwa answer correctly this time?)

975
00:33:52,607 --> 00:33:54,170
Negative three.

976
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:58,310
Wait, let's hear his explanation.

977
00:33:58,479 --> 00:33:59,680
Why is it three?

978
00:33:59,681 --> 00:34:01,310
- Is it positive three? - Come on.

979
00:34:01,316 --> 00:34:02,810
We can't play at all.

980
00:34:02,817 --> 00:34:03,810
Let us play.

981
00:34:03,818 --> 00:34:05,080
I haven't played either.

982
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,920
At this rate,

983
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:08,850
- we can't even multiply. - This is terrible.

984
00:34:08,856 --> 00:34:10,590
Let's try multiplication.

985
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:11,820
- Gosh. - Seriously.

986
00:34:11,826 --> 00:34:13,990
- Let's try multiplication. - Okay.

987
00:34:13,995 --> 00:34:15,090
Let's do multiplication.

988
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:16,890
At this rate, we can't succeed.

989
00:34:16,898 --> 00:34:18,660
- How do we play? - This is multiplication.

990
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:20,100
You multiply the numbers.

991
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:21,100
I see.

992
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:22,100
Let's multiply

993
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:24,200
(Let's multiply starts.)

994
00:34:24,205 --> 00:34:25,670
- 2 by 5. - 10.

995
00:34:25,707 --> 00:34:27,770
- 6 by 6. - 36.

996
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,740
(He stutters the answer.)

997
00:34:32,013 --> 00:34:33,710
- 7 by 5. - 35.

998
00:34:33,715 --> 00:34:35,210
- 2 by 4. - 8.

999
00:34:35,216 --> 00:34:38,550
- 6 by 5. - 6 by 5 is 35.

1000
00:34:40,988 --> 00:34:42,020
(What did you say?)

1001
00:34:42,023 --> 00:34:43,820
I meant 30.

1002
00:34:43,825 --> 00:34:45,090
Jong Kook is suspicious.

1003
00:34:45,093 --> 00:34:47,190
- He's hiding something. - Right.

1004
00:34:47,195 --> 00:34:49,090
- I'm sure of it. - I meant 30.

1005
00:34:49,097 --> 00:34:51,090
- 6 by 5 is 30. - He can't play games on the bus.

1006
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:52,730
- I'm terrible. - He's bad at games on the bus.

1007
00:34:52,734 --> 00:34:55,500
- I get too nervous on the bus. - He was nervous.

1008
00:34:55,503 --> 00:34:57,300
But 6 by 5 is 35 is too much.

1009
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:59,870
- Seriously. - Let's call out our names instead.

1010
00:35:00,608 --> 00:35:02,710
What do you mean by call out our names?

1011
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,270
If I say Jee, you say Seok Jin.

1012
00:35:05,279 --> 00:35:06,780
Yu Jae Seok.

1013
00:35:06,781 --> 00:35:08,010
We'll get it wrong if we play fast.

1014
00:35:08,015 --> 00:35:09,710
How about this game?

1015
00:35:09,717 --> 00:35:11,250
If you say "Choi",

1016
00:35:11,252 --> 00:35:13,020
- I should say "Gwi Hwa". - Okay.

1017
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,820
Answer to "Yang" is "Se Chan". You must answer immediately.

1018
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:17,920
- Answer to "Go" is "Bo Gyeol". - The next person answers.

1019
00:35:17,925 --> 00:35:19,490
We play all kinds of games.

1020
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:20,730
Let's say each other's name.

1021
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:24,290
- Let's memorize names - Let's memorize names

1022
00:35:24,298 --> 00:35:25,560
- Yu. - Jae Seok.

1023
00:35:25,566 --> 00:35:26,600
Kim.

1024
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:28,730
Sung... Sung Tae.

1025
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,070
- Kim Sung Tae? - Who is that?

1026
00:35:30,071 --> 00:35:31,670
- Hey! - I can't believe this.

1027
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:33,310
- Hey, this is hard. - He's the villain.

1028
00:35:33,408 --> 00:35:34,600
- You got my name wrong. - My goodness.

1029
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:36,310
We can't play a single game right.

1030
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,470
How can't we get past the first three members?

1031
00:35:37,478 --> 00:35:40,210
- It's odd you'd get my name wrong. - Choi...

1032
00:35:40,214 --> 00:35:41,310
He's disappointed.

1033
00:35:41,315 --> 00:35:42,550
- Jong Kook is upset now. - Hey.

1034
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,210
- Something is definitely wrong. - You guys own a restaurant.

1035
00:35:44,218 --> 00:35:46,650
His mistake is worse than my multiplication mistake.

1036
00:35:46,654 --> 00:35:49,190
(His mistake is worse than my multiplication mistake.)

1037
00:35:49,657 --> 00:35:50,890
- Here he goes again. - He got my name...

1038
00:35:51,092 --> 00:35:53,090
- Jong Kook said wrong answers too. - I can't do this.

1039
00:35:53,795 --> 00:35:56,830
Jong Kook, didn't you get all of the questions wrong today?

1040
00:35:56,831 --> 00:35:57,960
You'd better shut it.

1041
00:35:58,232 --> 00:35:59,400
I was just pointing that out.

1042
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,460
(He backs down.)

1043
00:36:00,468 --> 00:36:02,600
We should start from the other side.

1044
00:36:02,603 --> 00:36:04,440
All right. We'll start from Ji Hyo this time.

1045
00:36:05,006 --> 00:36:07,970
- Let's memorize names - Let's memorize names

1046
00:36:07,975 --> 00:36:09,470
- Yang. - Se Chan.

1047
00:36:09,477 --> 00:36:10,940
- Heo. - Sung Tae.

1048
00:36:10,978 --> 00:36:12,280
- Yang. - Se Chan.

1049
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,280
- Yu. - Jae Seok.

1050
00:36:15,283 --> 00:36:16,380
Choi.

1051
00:36:16,484 --> 00:36:18,250
Whose family name is Choi?

1052
00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:19,880
(What?)

1053
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:21,420
- Goodness. - Choi Gwi Hwa.

1054
00:36:21,422 --> 00:36:22,590
(Gwi Hwa is sitting behind him.)

1055
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,260
- You're acting weird too. - Hold on a second.

1056
00:36:24,425 --> 00:36:25,420
- Hold on. - No, it's not that.

1057
00:36:25,426 --> 00:36:28,330
- He knows names of the whole staff. - No, it was an honest mistake.

1058
00:36:28,362 --> 00:36:29,990
- Okay. - Unbelievable.

1059
00:36:29,997 --> 00:36:31,260
- I want to play the game too. - I understand...

1060
00:36:31,265 --> 00:36:33,530
- why you'd suspect me. - Hang on a second.

1061
00:36:33,534 --> 00:36:36,370
He is definitely a villain, a detective, or a witness.

1062
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,530
He's a villain. It's a game to get a hint about the villain.

1063
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:40,270
I see. He could be a villain.

1064
00:36:40,274 --> 00:36:42,510
Besides, Gwi Hwa got really upset.

1065
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,910
- Gwi Hwa. - When Jae Seok couldn't answer,

1066
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,110
he went, "Come on!"

1067
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,410
- Seriously. - "Come on!"

1068
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:49,550
I mean he made it so obvious that he's the villain.

1069
00:36:49,884 --> 00:36:51,650
- I forgot for a second. - It was too obvious.

1070
00:36:51,652 --> 00:36:53,790
- I'm sorry, Gwi Hwa. - That's all right.

1071
00:36:54,622 --> 00:36:56,790
- Which game can we finish? - Gosh, Sung Tae.

1072
00:36:56,791 --> 00:36:58,020
- Which game can we actually play? - Let's play this one more time.

1073
00:36:58,025 --> 00:36:59,360
- Hey, we should just... - Why do we always...

1074
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,730
Let's avoid using our brain. Let's just remove name tags.

1075
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:06,730
Why would we try to be smart and earn hints?

1076
00:37:06,734 --> 00:37:07,970
Forget about the hint.

1077
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,130
- Just turn off all the cameras. - Let's just go to our destination.

1078
00:37:11,138 --> 00:37:12,370
Hey, let's close this down.

1079
00:37:12,373 --> 00:37:14,570
- 1, 2, 3. - I won't play it anymore.

1080
00:37:14,575 --> 00:37:15,910
- So then... - We're done for the day.

1081
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:18,340
- we won't provide the hint then. - Okay.

1082
00:37:18,346 --> 00:37:19,950
(The hint evaporates into the air.)

1083
00:37:20,715 --> 00:37:22,720
Oh, yes! We're having braised cutlassfish.

1084
00:37:23,017 --> 00:37:24,380
- What? - Look at the cutlassfish.

1085
00:37:24,385 --> 00:37:25,650
Gosh, It's braised cutlassfish.

1086
00:37:25,653 --> 00:37:26,950
- Look at the cutlassfish. - It looks so delicious.

1087
00:37:27,054 --> 00:37:28,220
I've never seen something like this.

1088
00:37:28,222 --> 00:37:29,420
It's Kwang Soo!

1089
00:37:29,423 --> 00:37:30,820
Why is that me? How?

1090
00:37:30,825 --> 00:37:32,820
This is just like Kwang Soo. It's so long.

1091
00:37:32,827 --> 00:37:34,660
(With braised cutlassfish as long as a giraffe's neck...)

1092
00:37:34,662 --> 00:37:36,590
- They put an entire cutlassfish? - My goodness.

1093
00:37:36,597 --> 00:37:38,660
The meals are divided into high, middle, low.

1094
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:39,730
(What is the mission?)

1095
00:37:40,034 --> 00:37:41,530
I just need to avoid getting put into the low group.

1096
00:37:41,536 --> 00:37:42,670
(Cutlassfish, abalone seafood stew, and rice with dried laver)

1097
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,070
The middle set is good too.

1098
00:37:44,438 --> 00:37:47,300
With this mission, you will get to win your meals.

1099
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,040
The mission is National Acting Contest.

1100
00:37:49,043 --> 00:37:51,880
(The mission for their meal is National Acting Contest.)

1101
00:37:51,913 --> 00:37:54,810
You will each choose the script of a famous scene...

1102
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:56,150
and a regional accent randomly.

1103
00:37:56,183 --> 00:37:58,480
The members who chose the same script will become partners...

1104
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:00,290
and act out the scene together.

1105
00:38:00,354 --> 00:38:03,160
The special panel's evaluation will determine the set you will receive.

1106
00:38:03,257 --> 00:38:06,160
The pair with the highest mark will win the mission.

1107
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,620
(The special panel will determine their meals.)

1108
00:38:07,628 --> 00:38:09,630
I hope you like my acting.

1109
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,730
(A cameraman, an AD, and restaurant owner)

1110
00:38:11,098 --> 00:38:12,700
- Ji Hyo, you should go first. - Is it our turn?

1111
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,230
(The first pair is Ji Hyo and Gwi Hwa.)

1112
00:38:14,235 --> 00:38:15,670
Ji Hyo and Gwi Hwa.

1113
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,600
They didn't know what we were doing today.

1114
00:38:17,605 --> 00:38:20,870
(He warms up his voice.)

1115
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:22,070
Hey, do something with your phlegm.

1116
00:38:22,076 --> 00:38:23,640
You should spit it out over there.

1117
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,210
My gosh, the phlegm fairy is back.

1118
00:38:26,714 --> 00:38:27,940
The phlegm fairy.

1119
00:38:27,949 --> 00:38:29,080
(That sound is so not pleasant.)

1120
00:38:29,283 --> 00:38:31,750
He clears his throat. It's like a performance to him.

1121
00:38:31,953 --> 00:38:33,720
- We'll do "The Wailing"... - It's better to do it alone.

1122
00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:35,280
- with the standard accent of Seoul. - Really?

1123
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:36,520
("The Wailing" with the standard accent)

1124
00:38:37,091 --> 00:38:39,820
I'm a cop. I know when people lie.

1125
00:38:39,827 --> 00:38:42,220
(This is the original version of the film.)

1126
00:38:42,229 --> 00:38:43,700
You've met him, right?

1127
00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:47,200
Is that what matters now? Is it?

1128
00:38:47,768 --> 00:38:49,000
Is it?

1129
00:38:49,003 --> 00:38:50,570
(This is the original version of the film.)

1130
00:38:50,671 --> 00:38:53,110
The concept we're going to go for is this.

1131
00:38:53,174 --> 00:38:55,340
- We moved to Seoul from a suburb. - That sounds great.

1132
00:38:55,343 --> 00:38:57,870
- We'll try to use standard Korean. - That's great.

1133
00:38:57,878 --> 00:38:59,540
- That sounds fun. - This is a hard thing to do.

1134
00:38:59,547 --> 00:39:00,810
It's a good concept.

1135
00:39:02,116 --> 00:39:03,280
This is quite difficult.

1136
00:39:03,484 --> 00:39:05,380
I'm the father, and he's the daughter.

1137
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:07,550
(However, Ji Hyo is the father, and Gwi Hwa is the daughter.)

1138
00:39:07,555 --> 00:39:09,660
- He's the daughter? - Yes.

1139
00:39:10,758 --> 00:39:11,890
He's the daughter?

1140
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:13,730
I guess the daughter is a heavy smoker.

1141
00:39:14,028 --> 00:39:15,430
Don't you think this is absurd?

1142
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:18,300
Shouldn't he get treatment first?

1143
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:20,700
He's planning to get treated soon.

1144
00:39:20,768 --> 00:39:21,930
- We'll begin now. - Okay.

1145
00:39:22,803 --> 00:39:26,110
("The Wailing" with standard accent of Seoul)

1146
00:39:26,874 --> 00:39:31,010
Hyo Jin, I'm a cop.

1147
00:39:31,746 --> 00:39:33,680
I know when people lie.

1148
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:35,950
She is trying to speak standard Korean.

1149
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:37,650
She sounds too nice.

1150
00:39:38,352 --> 00:39:40,820
I know when people lie.

1151
00:39:41,222 --> 00:39:43,960
You've met him, right? Tell me.

1152
00:39:44,825 --> 00:39:46,030
Hurry.

1153
00:39:46,527 --> 00:39:49,360
(He clears his throat.)

1154
00:39:49,363 --> 00:39:50,360
(The phlegm fairy returns.)

1155
00:39:50,364 --> 00:39:51,460
My goodness, your throat...

1156
00:39:51,465 --> 00:39:54,330
- He's using it as a special skill. - What is he doing?

1157
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,460
The phlegm...

1158
00:39:55,469 --> 00:39:59,100
(The phlegm fairy focuses on his role.)

1159
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:00,240
Is that...

1160
00:40:00,241 --> 00:40:03,010
(He speaks with a weird accent.)

1161
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:05,240
(From which province is that accent from?)

1162
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:06,850
His enunciation is amazing.

1163
00:40:07,515 --> 00:40:09,080
Tell me everything.

1164
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,150
Tell me where you met him, and what you did.

1165
00:40:13,487 --> 00:40:18,120
Why must I tell you that?

1166
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,590
Is he a foreigner?

1167
00:40:21,228 --> 00:40:22,430
- Doesn't he sound like one? - He might be.

1168
00:40:22,496 --> 00:40:24,830
They sound like idiots.

1169
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,000
(I recently moved to Seoul.)

1170
00:40:26,534 --> 00:40:29,540
Because it's very important.

1171
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:31,970
Is that what matters now?

1172
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,170
Why are you being so stubborn?

1173
00:40:35,176 --> 00:40:36,540
Is that what matters now?

1174
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:39,210
Is that truly what matters now?

1175
00:40:39,246 --> 00:40:40,950
Is it? Is it?

1176
00:40:41,282 --> 00:40:44,650
(His throat is full of phlegm.)

1177
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:46,020
Is that what matters now?

1178
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,780
(Thanks to his phlegm, they end with a bang.)

1179
00:40:47,788 --> 00:40:49,020
I bet that's part of the act.

1180
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,820
- This is unbelievable. - Gosh, he's a phlegm fairy.

1181
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:54,190
Let's check their score. 1, 2, 3.

1182
00:40:55,029 --> 00:40:58,600
(Ji Hyo and Gwi Hwa wins abalone seafood stew.)

1183
00:40:58,632 --> 00:41:01,930
- My gosh. - You won the middle set.

1184
00:41:02,236 --> 00:41:03,470
- They won the abalones. - That's a good one.

1185
00:41:03,471 --> 00:41:04,730
- The abalone seafood stew... - Chan Hee...

1186
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:07,410
Chan Hee isn't a generous judge.

1187
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:08,970
I was next to him. It was just disgusting.

1188
00:41:08,976 --> 00:41:11,240
(Gwi Hwa's phlegm grosses Chan Hee out.)

1189
00:41:11,245 --> 00:41:12,580
He found it to be disgusting.

1190
00:41:12,747 --> 00:41:14,580
- We won a good one though. - Okay.

1191
00:41:14,682 --> 00:41:15,950
- We will act out... - Okay.

1192
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,650
- the film, "Friend" with... - That's going to be a fun one.

1193
00:41:17,651 --> 00:41:19,420
- Chungcheong Province's accent. - Chungcheong Province's accent.

1194
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,750
That's great.

1195
00:41:20,755 --> 00:41:23,350
- This is a good one. - Se Chan is good...

1196
00:41:23,357 --> 00:41:24,820
- at skits. - That's right.

1197
00:41:24,825 --> 00:41:26,060
He's the master of skits.

1198
00:41:26,227 --> 00:41:28,090
- It's like "Comedy Big League". - He's the funniest.

1199
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,230
- What does your father do? - He's a gangster.

1200
00:41:31,232 --> 00:41:34,530
(This is the original version of the film.)

1201
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:37,030
(The teacher takes off his watch and curses at him.)

1202
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:39,270
Se Chan is the most confident when he does a skit.

1203
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:41,240
- What is that? You have a hat? - Sorry?

1204
00:41:41,242 --> 00:41:42,770
Later on, I have to hit you with a watch.

1205
00:41:42,777 --> 00:41:44,440
(Later on, I have to hit you with a watch.)

1206
00:41:44,678 --> 00:41:45,710
You have to hit me with a watch?

1207
00:41:45,713 --> 00:41:46,880
I was going to improvise later.

1208
00:41:47,314 --> 00:41:49,110
He prepared that without giving me a heads-up.

1209
00:41:50,918 --> 00:41:52,250
We're going to start now. Give us the signals.

1210
00:41:52,253 --> 00:41:53,550
(He puts on his props for improvisation.)

1211
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:55,920
Ready, action.

1212
00:41:56,891 --> 00:41:59,690
What just happened?

1213
00:42:00,094 --> 00:42:03,300
"You run into an enemy at the worst time and place."

1214
00:42:03,764 --> 00:42:08,370
What did you do, Dong Soo?

1215
00:42:08,536 --> 00:42:10,000
What does your father do?

1216
00:42:11,505 --> 00:42:13,610
- He... - Your father is...

1217
00:42:13,941 --> 00:42:17,540
Your father is busy trying to buy you shoes and pants...

1218
00:42:17,545 --> 00:42:19,180
and to provide for you.

1219
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,680
How could you be ungrateful?

1220
00:42:21,682 --> 00:42:23,120
Hey.

1221
00:42:23,217 --> 00:42:25,180
What does your father do?

1222
00:42:25,186 --> 00:42:26,690
- He is... - Wait.

1223
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:28,680
(He pinches both cheeks tightly.)

1224
00:42:28,689 --> 00:42:30,590
Hang on.

1225
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:31,820
(He adds an additional part.)

1226
00:42:31,826 --> 00:42:33,660
What does your father do?

1227
00:42:33,661 --> 00:42:36,700
- He is a... - Right, your father...

1228
00:42:36,797 --> 00:42:38,130
Doesn't Kwang Soo have lines?

1229
00:42:38,132 --> 00:42:39,400
What does your father do?

1230
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,060
- He is... - Listen. Your father...

1231
00:42:41,068 --> 00:42:43,270
is busying trying to support you.

1232
00:42:43,337 --> 00:42:46,240
You shouldn't be like this, Dong Soo.

1233
00:42:46,674 --> 00:42:48,110
It seems Kwang Soo has no lines.

1234
00:42:48,442 --> 00:42:50,040
Dong Soo, tell me.

1235
00:42:50,444 --> 00:42:52,680
- My father... He is... - You.

1236
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,440
Your father is trying to...

1237
00:42:54,448 --> 00:42:57,020
(He slaps Kwang Soo with love.)

1238
00:42:57,585 --> 00:42:58,710
Dong Soo, go back to your seat!

1239
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:00,820
(He yells at him.)

1240
00:43:00,821 --> 00:43:01,950
Jun Seok, you're next.

1241
00:43:01,956 --> 00:43:03,120
(Dong Soo exits without a word.)

1242
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:04,990
Jun Seok is next? You'll be Jun Seok now?

1243
00:43:05,392 --> 00:43:09,190
You rascals. You know that I'm very busy.

1244
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:10,530
Jun Seok.

1245
00:43:10,531 --> 00:43:11,630
(I'm going to say my lines this time.)

1246
00:43:11,665 --> 00:43:14,660
"You run into an enemy at the worst time and place."

1247
00:43:14,668 --> 00:43:16,300
Fancy meeting you here.

1248
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:17,800
(His lines are identical.)

1249
00:43:17,805 --> 00:43:19,310
- He's so good. - What does your father do?

1250
00:43:19,473 --> 00:43:21,070
What does your father do?

1251
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:23,370
- He is... - You know what? Your father...

1252
00:43:23,377 --> 00:43:25,940
is busy trying to provide for you.

1253
00:43:25,946 --> 00:43:30,280
You shouldn't go around hitting on girls.

1254
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:32,950
(That's right! He does hit on girls a lot.)

1255
00:43:32,953 --> 00:43:34,350
What does your father do?

1256
00:43:34,355 --> 00:43:35,950
- He is... - What does he do? What's his job?

1257
00:43:35,956 --> 00:43:37,490
How could you do this to him?

1258
00:43:37,591 --> 00:43:38,690
Go back to your seat!

1259
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:40,430
Hey, tell Kwang Soo to come up.

1260
00:43:40,961 --> 00:43:45,030
They don't know how scary I can be.

1261
00:43:45,032 --> 00:43:46,470
(He summons a student that isn't in the script.)

1262
00:43:46,934 --> 00:43:50,300
(Jun Seok is out, and here comes Kwang Soo.)

1263
00:43:50,504 --> 00:43:51,940
(Is this deja vu?)

1264
00:43:51,972 --> 00:43:54,540
"You run into an enemy at the worst time and place."

1265
00:43:54,642 --> 00:43:57,210
(I memorized the line.)

1266
00:43:57,578 --> 00:43:59,350
Isn't this Kwang Soo?

1267
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,750
I haven't seen you today.

1268
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,150
Kwang Soo, first of all,

1269
00:44:04,251 --> 00:44:05,880
I can't let you off the hook.

1270
00:44:05,886 --> 00:44:07,580
(The teacher takes off his watch.)

1271
00:44:07,588 --> 00:44:09,420
You need to get a good beating first.

1272
00:44:09,657 --> 00:44:11,320
(It's part of the script.)

1273
00:44:11,325 --> 00:44:12,760
What does your father do?

1274
00:44:13,327 --> 00:44:15,690
He runs a furniture shop.

1275
00:44:15,696 --> 00:44:16,730
He's the principal.

1276
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:18,790
Is that so? Go back to your seat.

1277
00:44:18,799 --> 00:44:20,800
(He's kind to Kwang Soo all of a sudden.)

1278
00:44:20,801 --> 00:44:22,030
I'm sorry.

1279
00:44:22,236 --> 00:44:23,270
This is it.

1280
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:25,000
(Se Chan and Kwang Soo put on a great scene.)

1281
00:44:25,005 --> 00:44:26,900
- That was hilarious. - They were good.

1282
00:44:26,907 --> 00:44:28,470
They were amazing.

1283
00:44:28,475 --> 00:44:30,110
- They were fantastic. - Let's check their score.

1284
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:31,540
1, 2, 3.

1285
00:44:32,313 --> 00:44:36,180
(Kwang Soo and Se Chan wins a meal with braised cutlassfish.)

1286
00:44:36,183 --> 00:44:37,280
We got the high set.

1287
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:38,550
We got the best one.

1288
00:44:39,186 --> 00:44:40,750
They'll get to eat the cutlassfish.

1289
00:44:40,754 --> 00:44:42,090
(High, Middle)

1290
00:44:42,656 --> 00:44:43,690
We'll go next.

1291
00:44:43,691 --> 00:44:45,490
- We'll do Gangwon Province accent. - Gangwon Province accent?

1292
00:44:45,492 --> 00:44:48,060
- I'm not familiar with the accent. - Gosh, this is...

1293
00:44:48,062 --> 00:44:51,000
I speak fluently with Gangwon Province accent.

1294
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:54,460
- Sit down. - It seems you're younger than me.

1295
00:44:54,468 --> 00:44:55,460
("Nameless Gangster")

1296
00:44:55,469 --> 00:44:56,670
Don't drop the honorifics.

1297
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,630
- What are you acting up for? Sit. - Don't you dare...

1298
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:02,110
touch me! Where's your boss?

1299
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:03,610
- Ready. - Okay.

1300
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:04,810
Action.

1301
00:45:04,812 --> 00:45:06,010
("Nameless Gangster" with Gangwon Province accent)

1302
00:45:06,013 --> 00:45:07,180
Sit down.

1303
00:45:08,749 --> 00:45:09,910
Hang on a second.

1304
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:11,080
Sit down.

1305
00:45:11,085 --> 00:45:12,180
Hang on a second.

1306
00:45:12,186 --> 00:45:14,120
- Hold on. - Isn't it your Won Bin impression?

1307
00:45:14,221 --> 00:45:15,850
- That was your impression of him. - Wait.

1308
00:45:15,856 --> 00:45:17,120
(Isn't that your impression of Won Bin?)

1309
00:45:17,458 --> 00:45:21,260
(It matches with his impression of Won Bin a month ago.)

1310
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:22,860
- Hey! - That's "Autumn in My Heart".

1311
00:45:22,863 --> 00:45:23,960
What are you talking about?

1312
00:45:23,964 --> 00:45:25,630
Isn't that the Gyeongsang Province accent?

1313
00:45:25,632 --> 00:45:26,900
That is right.

1314
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,300
- "Sit here." - Focus.

1315
00:45:28,302 --> 00:45:29,700
"Sit here." That's the accent.

1316
00:45:29,703 --> 00:45:32,040
- Focus. - It's the Gangwon Province accent.

1317
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:33,570
- Gangwon Province. - Let's try again.

1318
00:45:34,341 --> 00:45:35,510
Sit here.

1319
00:45:36,076 --> 00:45:38,740
I'm older than you. Show some respect.

1320
00:45:39,013 --> 00:45:40,440
That's the Gyeongsang Province accent.

1321
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:42,810
(It sounds the same as the original version.)

1322
00:45:42,816 --> 00:45:44,550
You should speak the Gangwon Province accent.

1323
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:47,450
- Practice first. - Speak the Gangwon Province accent.

1324
00:45:47,454 --> 00:45:50,190
- "Show some respect." - "Stop it."

1325
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:53,390
I'm older than you. Show some respect.

1326
00:45:53,727 --> 00:45:55,190
- Nice. - That's the Gangwon Province one.

1327
00:45:55,195 --> 00:45:56,400
Hey!

1328
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:57,760
He hit her for real.

1329
00:45:57,765 --> 00:45:58,760
(Hey!)

1330
00:45:58,766 --> 00:46:00,530
(He hit her.)

1331
00:46:00,534 --> 00:46:02,870
He hit her for real.

1332
00:46:03,404 --> 00:46:04,470
It says, "hitting her head".

1333
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:06,000
Why are you so proud?

1334
00:46:06,006 --> 00:46:07,210
Sit down.

1335
00:46:07,374 --> 00:46:08,810
Are you out of your mind?

1336
00:46:09,376 --> 00:46:12,640
How dare you hit me? Where's the chief?

1337
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:16,120
Bring Chief Kang. Do you know who I am?

1338
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,650
I'm...

1339
00:46:18,652 --> 00:46:20,220
- That accent is wrong. - Every sentence sounds the same.

1340
00:46:20,621 --> 00:46:22,690
In old comedy sketches,

1341
00:46:22,756 --> 00:46:25,920
they put "ski" at the end of every word to sound Russian.

1342
00:46:25,926 --> 00:46:28,020
How do you know our chief?

1343
00:46:28,028 --> 00:46:29,430
(Jae Seok speaks like So Min now.)

1344
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:31,730
Does your chief live...

1345
00:46:32,466 --> 00:46:34,300
in Namcheon-dong?

1346
00:46:34,301 --> 00:46:38,130
(Only the last part sounds like a Gangwon Province accent.)

1347
00:46:38,138 --> 00:46:39,770
Say, "Yes."

1348
00:46:40,174 --> 00:46:41,970
- Yes. Why? - "That's right."

1349
00:46:42,109 --> 00:46:43,610
You know,

1350
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:46,510
your chief and I...

1351
00:46:46,613 --> 00:46:47,780
The day before yesterday...

1352
00:46:47,781 --> 00:46:49,240
That's Gyeongsang Province.

1353
00:46:49,249 --> 00:46:51,680
We even ate together.

1354
00:46:51,685 --> 00:46:54,190
We went to a sauna together, too.

1355
00:46:54,455 --> 00:46:55,850
You know?

1356
00:46:55,889 --> 00:46:58,060
Hit me. Okay?

1357
00:46:59,526 --> 00:47:00,560
(She coughs up the red hat.)

1358
00:47:00,561 --> 00:47:02,020
My hat...

1359
00:47:02,029 --> 00:47:04,590
(She coughs up the red hat.)

1360
00:47:04,598 --> 00:47:06,300
What are you doing?

1361
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,600
I'm coughing up blood.

1362
00:47:07,601 --> 00:47:09,400
- It's blood. - Is that blood?

1363
00:47:09,403 --> 00:47:11,440
If we show blood, our show will be X-rated.

1364
00:47:12,005 --> 00:47:13,500
Does it end like this?

1365
00:47:13,507 --> 00:47:16,170
(Jae Seok and So Min finish up hurriedly.)

1366
00:47:16,176 --> 00:47:18,970
- I'm not familiar with the accent. - The accent is too difficult.

1367
00:47:18,979 --> 00:47:20,150
Please show us your score.

1368
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,950
1, 2, 3.

1369
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:23,880
(Jae Seok and So Min...)

1370
00:47:23,884 --> 00:47:27,290
(will only eat dried laver and rice.)

1371
00:47:27,521 --> 00:47:29,720
- So Hyun is so stingy. - What?

1372
00:47:30,457 --> 00:47:32,760
- You laughed. - You're so stingy.

1373
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,260
No?

1374
00:47:34,661 --> 00:47:35,860
Gosh.

1375
00:47:36,897 --> 00:47:39,930
(After passionate acting, they're starving.)

1376
00:47:39,933 --> 00:47:42,430
Your meal will be ready soon.

1377
00:47:42,436 --> 00:47:44,930
- Wow, this is a feast. - It looks amazing.

1378
00:47:44,938 --> 00:47:46,400
(High, Medium, Low)

1379
00:47:46,406 --> 00:47:48,040
Let's eat.

1380
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:49,470
I'm happy with Medium.

1381
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:51,110
- Look at this. - Bo Gyeol, you're an angel.

1382
00:47:51,178 --> 00:47:52,410
It looks so tasty.

1383
00:47:53,347 --> 00:47:54,910
Look at this cutlassfish.

1384
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:56,150
(Kwang Soo and Se Chan get to eat cutlassfish.)

1385
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:59,080
- We can't give you any. - Fine.

1386
00:47:59,386 --> 00:48:00,850
All right.

1387
00:48:00,854 --> 00:48:01,920
The soup tastes amazing.

1388
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:03,590
(Jong Kook and Bo Gyeol won High too.)

1389
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,460
- Bo Gyeol. - Gosh.

1390
00:48:06,527 --> 00:48:07,690
Let us taste the cutlassfish.

1391
00:48:07,694 --> 00:48:09,260
Let us try.

1392
00:48:09,563 --> 00:48:12,200
Can I try the cutlassfish soup?

1393
00:48:12,499 --> 00:48:15,370
Put some effort.

1394
00:48:15,736 --> 00:48:17,030
Here.

1395
00:48:17,037 --> 00:48:19,370
So Min can do an impression of...

1396
00:48:19,373 --> 00:48:20,470
Joo Hyun.

1397
00:48:20,507 --> 00:48:21,670
- Really? - Yes .

1398
00:48:21,675 --> 00:48:23,070
Try.

1399
00:48:23,076 --> 00:48:27,610
"Gosh, you brat, give me some shrimp."

1400
00:48:28,048 --> 00:48:29,580
That brat.

1401
00:48:29,583 --> 00:48:30,650
(Kwang Soo gets mad.)

1402
00:48:30,717 --> 00:48:31,980
Gosh.

1403
00:48:31,985 --> 00:48:33,890
Hey, Kwang Soo, you punk.

1404
00:48:34,521 --> 00:48:35,790
So Min.

1405
00:48:36,089 --> 00:48:37,350
Please wait.

1406
00:48:37,357 --> 00:48:38,450
(So Min approaches the shrimp.)

1407
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:40,120
Good job.

1408
00:48:40,127 --> 00:48:41,520
Gosh, you brat.

1409
00:48:41,528 --> 00:48:43,290
Let me taste the shrimp.

1410
00:48:43,297 --> 00:48:45,630
Give me some soy sauce.

1411
00:48:45,699 --> 00:48:47,770
- You brat. - Who is that supposed to be?

1412
00:48:48,769 --> 00:48:50,770
- Give me some soy sauce. - Give me soy sauce.

1413
00:48:50,771 --> 00:48:51,870
- Let's give them a piece. - Please.

1414
00:48:51,872 --> 00:48:55,000
- A piece? - Hey, give it back.

1415
00:48:55,008 --> 00:48:56,270
So Min.

1416
00:48:56,276 --> 00:48:57,340
We can give you a piece.

1417
00:48:57,344 --> 00:49:01,150
- Stay out of this, you brat. - What?

1418
00:49:01,548 --> 00:49:02,910
What?

1419
00:49:02,916 --> 00:49:04,850
- Stay out of this. - What?

1420
00:49:05,018 --> 00:49:06,450
I'm laughing...

1421
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,490
because it's silly, not because she's good.

1422
00:49:08,522 --> 00:49:11,260
Sang Yeob, can you do impressions?

1423
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:13,460
Please do an impression of Jang Hyuk.

1424
00:49:13,827 --> 00:49:15,290
Jang Hyuk?

1425
00:49:15,295 --> 00:49:17,330
- I can tell if he's good. - How about Jung Woo Sung?

1426
00:49:17,331 --> 00:49:19,660
I'll do an impression of Jang Hyuk first.

1427
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:21,000
(He's aiming for a piece of cutlassfish.)

1428
00:49:22,002 --> 00:49:23,600
Hello, I'm Jang Hyuk.

1429
00:49:23,604 --> 00:49:28,270
(He sounds pretty similar.)

1430
00:49:28,308 --> 00:49:30,010
Eon Nyun!

1431
00:49:31,044 --> 00:49:32,510
(Eon Nyun!)

1432
00:49:34,081 --> 00:49:35,940
Eon Nyun!

1433
00:49:35,949 --> 00:49:37,350
(It's hilarious, but it's actually pretty similar.)

1434
00:49:37,384 --> 00:49:40,320
It's how Hyuk calls Da Hae in "The Slave Hunters".

1435
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,250
I'm sorry, but I didn't watch "The Slave Hunters".

1436
00:49:42,256 --> 00:49:43,550
- It was perfect. - Really?

1437
00:49:43,557 --> 00:49:44,920
- It was perfect. - Jong Kook.

1438
00:49:44,925 --> 00:49:47,060
- Should we talk on the phone? - Sure.

1439
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,520
(Sang Yeob calls Jong Kook in Jang Hyuk's voice.)

1440
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:51,060
- Hyuk. - Yes.

1441
00:49:51,732 --> 00:49:52,930
Where are you?

1442
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,060
- It's similar. - What are you doing?

1443
00:49:55,068 --> 00:49:56,970
I'm shooting Running Man. What about you?

1444
00:49:57,971 --> 00:49:59,140
Give me some cutlassfish.

1445
00:50:00,274 --> 00:50:02,840
Give me a lot.

1446
00:50:03,677 --> 00:50:05,810
- He sounds just like him. - He does.

1447
00:50:06,113 --> 00:50:07,210
I admit it.

1448
00:50:07,447 --> 00:50:09,340
You'll get cutlassfish.

1449
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:10,610
If you do one more,

1450
00:50:10,617 --> 00:50:12,380
- we'll give you shrimp too. - It's Jung Woo Sung.

1451
00:50:12,452 --> 00:50:13,720
Jung Woo Sung.

1452
00:50:14,855 --> 00:50:18,350
(Can Sang Yeob copy...)

1453
00:50:18,358 --> 00:50:20,890
(Jung Woo Sung's soft voice?)

1454
00:50:22,362 --> 00:50:23,560
Did you eat?

1455
00:50:24,965 --> 00:50:27,130
Give me some cutlassfish.

1456
00:50:27,501 --> 00:50:28,830
It's perfect.

1457
00:50:28,835 --> 00:50:30,170
He sounded just like him. It gave me goosebumps.

1458
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:32,230
Oh, my.

1459
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:35,540
I haven't done it in five years, but it worked.

1460
00:50:36,076 --> 00:50:37,270
- We'll give you some cutlassfish. - You try.

1461
00:50:37,277 --> 00:50:38,540
We'll give you some cutlassfish.

1462
00:50:38,545 --> 00:50:40,610
- Shrimp and cutlassfish. - "Look at these bullets."

1463
00:50:40,614 --> 00:50:42,580
(Sang Yeob wins shrimp and cutlassfish.)

1464
00:50:42,616 --> 00:50:44,650
Look at these bullets.

1465
00:50:44,651 --> 00:50:46,650
Two shots in Vladivostok...

1466
00:50:46,953 --> 00:50:48,480
- Is that Joo Hyun? - Two bullets...

1467
00:50:48,488 --> 00:50:50,520
- So Min. - What's that?

1468
00:50:50,524 --> 00:50:51,890
It's Lee Jung Jae.

1469
00:50:51,892 --> 00:50:53,590
Try. You're doing great.

1470
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,230
There are two bullets.

1471
00:50:56,897 --> 00:50:58,660
"Two calves"? What are you saying?

1472
00:50:58,765 --> 00:50:59,830
What?

1473
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:01,700
"There are two bullets."

1474
00:51:01,702 --> 00:51:03,200
(It's supposed to be...)

1475
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,870
(It's Lee Jung Jae's line in "Assassination",)

1476
00:51:06,873 --> 00:51:09,070
("There are two holes.")

1477
00:51:09,176 --> 00:51:11,610
- So Min. - "There are two bullets."

1478
00:51:12,179 --> 00:51:13,450
"Two calves"?

1479
00:51:14,648 --> 00:51:15,980
"Two bullets".

1480
00:51:15,982 --> 00:51:17,850
Gwi Hwa, can you do something?

1481
00:51:17,951 --> 00:51:19,180
I can.

1482
00:51:19,186 --> 00:51:21,250
- He's been waiting. - This is Bae Chul Soo.

1483
00:51:21,688 --> 00:51:23,890
(He clears his throat.)

1484
00:51:25,025 --> 00:51:26,630
Hello. I'm Bae Chul Soo.

1485
00:51:27,294 --> 00:51:28,660
Michael Jackson...

1486
00:51:29,262 --> 00:51:32,130
and Mariah Carey's song that has been attracting...

1487
00:51:32,366 --> 00:51:33,760
Gwi Hwa, just drink your soup.

1488
00:51:33,767 --> 00:51:36,000
(Gwi Hwa, just drink your soup.)

1489
00:51:36,002 --> 00:51:37,330
(Okay. I will.)

1490
00:51:37,337 --> 00:51:38,500
Gwi Hwa.

1491
00:51:39,673 --> 00:51:40,770
Just drink your soup.

1492
00:51:40,774 --> 00:51:43,840
(This soup tastes great.)

1493
00:51:43,844 --> 00:51:47,480
Can I try again for Gwi Hwa?

1494
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:48,480
Sure.

1495
00:51:48,482 --> 00:51:51,380
I'll do two. I'll start with Lee Sun Gyun.

1496
00:51:51,985 --> 00:51:53,220
That sounds great.

1497
00:51:53,887 --> 00:51:56,420
Sun Gyun calls me,

1498
00:51:56,857 --> 00:51:58,420
and I pick up. "Hello."

1499
00:51:59,025 --> 00:52:00,790
"Where are you, you brat?"

1500
00:52:02,863 --> 00:52:03,860
(He's a human, copying machine.)

1501
00:52:03,864 --> 00:52:05,590
That sounds real.

1502
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,500
"Where are you?" "Give Ji Hyo some food."

1503
00:52:09,236 --> 00:52:10,270
"Give her some soy sauce."

1504
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:11,570
Two spaghetti alle vongole.

1505
00:52:11,571 --> 00:52:13,000
Stop it.

1506
00:52:13,006 --> 00:52:15,670
Be quiet. Just eat your shrimp.

1507
00:52:15,942 --> 00:52:17,440
- Two spaghetti alle vongole. - Eat your shrimp.

1508
00:52:17,911 --> 00:52:20,150
Bo Gyeol, can you do something?

1509
00:52:20,781 --> 00:52:22,280
I can copy Shimarisu-kun.

1510
00:52:22,349 --> 00:52:23,550
- What? - What?

1511
00:52:23,717 --> 00:52:24,910
- "Bonobono". - "Bonobono".

1512
00:52:24,918 --> 00:52:26,650
Oh, "Bonobono".

1513
00:52:26,653 --> 00:52:28,890
- I'm sure many people know it. - I know it.

1514
00:52:29,723 --> 00:52:31,620
"Shimarisu-kun..."

1515
00:52:32,025 --> 00:52:33,390
Amazing. Take this.

1516
00:52:33,393 --> 00:52:36,120
(Amazing. Take this.)

1517
00:52:36,129 --> 00:52:38,330
It was perfect. It's insane.

1518
00:52:38,331 --> 00:52:39,390
I can't help it.

1519
00:52:39,399 --> 00:52:40,570
Take everything.

1520
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,960
It was insane.

1521
00:52:41,968 --> 00:52:44,270
- "Hello." - It was perfect.

1522
00:52:44,404 --> 00:52:45,430
"Hello."

1523
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,540
(Hello)

1524
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,470
"I'm Bae Chul Soo."

1525
00:52:48,475 --> 00:52:49,700
"Bae Chul Soo's Music Camp".

1526
00:52:49,709 --> 00:52:51,210
(Let me try.)

1527
00:52:51,211 --> 00:52:53,210
- Hey. - Go back.

1528
00:52:53,213 --> 00:52:55,310
- That's not Bae Chul Soo. - Come back here.

1529
00:52:55,315 --> 00:52:57,180
- "Bae Chul Soo's Music Camp". - Be quiet.

1530
00:52:57,851 --> 00:52:59,480
- Stay still. - You ruined it.

1531
00:52:59,786 --> 00:53:01,720
- Don't do anything. - Give me some cutlassfish.

1532
00:53:01,721 --> 00:53:03,190
Stop it. Gosh.

1533
00:53:03,323 --> 00:53:04,720
"Yong Nyeo."

1534
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:07,120
Stop it. Just eat.

1535
00:53:07,127 --> 00:53:08,690
(Stop it.)

1536
00:53:09,463 --> 00:53:11,060
- Can I try? - Try what?

1537
00:53:11,064 --> 00:53:13,600
There's this app that's very popular.

1538
00:53:13,667 --> 00:53:15,660
- You can lip sync to movies. - I know that app.

1539
00:53:15,669 --> 00:53:17,000
- Right. - Let me try.

1540
00:53:17,003 --> 00:53:18,700
- Let me try. - It's so cute.

1541
00:53:18,705 --> 00:53:20,370
Kwang Soo and I will try.

1542
00:53:20,373 --> 00:53:22,140
Even IU and Suzy tried it.

1543
00:53:22,142 --> 00:53:23,970
- It's so popular. - Right.

1544
00:53:23,977 --> 00:53:25,170
(They want to show off their acting skills.)

1545
00:53:25,178 --> 00:53:26,340
This one.

1546
00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:29,210
Don't start yet.

1547
00:53:29,483 --> 00:53:31,550
- Start. - We should look at the screen.

1548
00:53:32,619 --> 00:53:36,620
Hey, do you want to have ramyeon at my place?

1549
00:53:36,823 --> 00:53:39,160
What? Ramyeon?

1550
00:53:39,626 --> 00:53:42,460
(Their acting is being recorded.)

1551
00:53:42,662 --> 00:53:45,330
- Sure. - He's good.

1552
00:53:46,132 --> 00:53:47,570
What are you thinking about?

1553
00:53:47,934 --> 00:53:49,930
(Shy)

1554
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:53,470
(Se Chan slaps Kwang Soo.)

1555
00:53:53,473 --> 00:53:54,770
What was that?

1556
00:53:54,975 --> 00:53:56,810
- Good. - Good.

1557
00:53:56,843 --> 00:53:57,870
What?

1558
00:53:57,878 --> 00:54:01,210
Isn't Kwang Soo older? He's been slapped so many times.

1559
00:54:02,716 --> 00:54:06,550
(Thanks, Kwang Soo,)

1560
00:54:06,586 --> 00:54:08,820
(for getting slapped so many times.)

1561
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:16,800
(Slap)

1562
00:54:17,531 --> 00:54:18,830
Should I be the girl?

1563
00:54:18,999 --> 00:54:20,660
Okay. You'll be the girl.

1564
00:54:20,667 --> 00:54:22,160
- You'll be the girl. - Okay.

1565
00:54:22,168 --> 00:54:23,300
All right.

1566
00:54:25,472 --> 00:54:28,800
Do you want to have ramyeon at my place?

1567
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:30,010
Jae Seok is good.

1568
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:32,010
What? Ramyeon?

1569
00:54:33,346 --> 00:54:34,340
Sure.

1570
00:54:34,347 --> 00:54:36,010
She's an actress.

1571
00:54:36,149 --> 00:54:38,020
Which ramyeon do you like?

1572
00:54:38,151 --> 00:54:40,320
- What? - What are you thinking about?

1573
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:44,550
You can only see half of So Min's face.

1574
00:54:44,558 --> 00:54:45,760
(You can only see Jae Seok's face.)

1575
00:54:45,926 --> 00:54:48,490
I mean... You can only see...

1576
00:54:48,495 --> 00:54:50,290
- He has to be in the center. - You can only see me.

1577
00:54:50,297 --> 00:54:51,360
(How does their video look?)

1578
00:54:51,865 --> 00:54:56,730
(Jae Seok is in the center, and you can only see So Min's eyes.)

1579
00:54:56,736 --> 00:54:58,640
All you see is my eye.

1580
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:03,310
Let me explain the rules of Sing with Your Body.

1581
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:04,510
What's the title?

1582
00:55:04,578 --> 00:55:06,140
- "Pain". - "Thorn".

1583
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:07,610
"Thorn" by Buzz.

1584
00:55:07,614 --> 00:55:09,340
(They have to describe the lyrics with their bodies.)

1585
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:11,710
You're a criminal, aren't you?

1586
00:55:11,718 --> 00:55:15,020
You'll get only one hint about the villains.

1587
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:16,120
(Everyone is given a hint about the villains.)

1588
00:55:16,122 --> 00:55:18,390
The villains are both men.

1589
00:55:18,391 --> 00:55:20,820
(The villains are both men.)

1590
00:55:20,827 --> 00:55:22,690
Both of them are male?

1591
00:55:22,963 --> 00:55:24,490
(Is it Jae Seok and Gwi Hwa?)

1592
00:55:24,497 --> 00:55:25,930
Are these two the villains?

1593
00:55:25,932 --> 00:55:27,430
You keep suspecting me.

1594
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:29,830
You suspect that I'm a villain.

1595
00:55:31,338 --> 00:55:34,940
(The final race at Tanhyeon Center)

1596
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:37,980
Here's the final mission to identify the villains.

1597
00:55:38,511 --> 00:55:40,210
It's called I Saw the Villains.

1598
00:55:40,213 --> 00:55:43,210
(I Saw the Villains)

1599
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:44,610
"I Saw the Villains"?

1600
00:55:44,618 --> 00:55:46,350
(I Saw the Villains?)

1601
00:55:46,753 --> 00:55:48,420
In this building,

1602
00:55:48,421 --> 00:55:51,750
there are hints related to the villains, detectives, and witness.

1603
00:55:51,758 --> 00:55:52,820
There are hints.

1604
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:55,160
Based on the hints that you find,

1605
00:55:55,295 --> 00:55:58,490
point out the member whom you suspect to be a villain...

1606
00:55:58,498 --> 00:56:00,760
at 2 trials that take place once every 30 minutes.

1607
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,030
That is how you eliminate them.

1608
00:56:02,035 --> 00:56:04,500
(Arrest the villains at the trial.)

1609
00:56:04,504 --> 00:56:06,910
If you eliminate both villains,

1610
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,370
the detectives and the civilians win.

1611
00:56:08,575 --> 00:56:10,510
If one of the villains survives,

1612
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:11,580
the villains win.

1613
00:56:11,878 --> 00:56:15,780
The winning team receives a prize of 3,000 dollars.

1614
00:56:15,782 --> 00:56:16,810
(The prize is 3,000 dollars.)

1615
00:56:16,816 --> 00:56:20,350
The detectives may eliminate the villains,

1616
00:56:20,787 --> 00:56:24,260
and the villains may eliminate the witness by tearing off the name tag.

1617
00:56:24,491 --> 00:56:26,320
If a detective eliminates the witness by mistake,

1618
00:56:26,326 --> 00:56:28,060
the civilians lose immediately.

1619
00:56:28,061 --> 00:56:30,390
(The civilians lose immediately.)

1620
00:56:30,397 --> 00:56:32,660
(Detectives must protect the witness.)

1621
00:56:32,666 --> 00:56:34,700
- It's dangerous. - Be careful, Detective.

1622
00:56:34,701 --> 00:56:35,770
Be careful.

1623
00:56:36,503 --> 00:56:39,170
If the villains eliminate civilians instead,

1624
00:56:39,172 --> 00:56:40,870
a hint related to him will be revealed.

1625
00:56:41,408 --> 00:56:43,300
If a villain eliminates a detective,

1626
00:56:43,309 --> 00:56:46,310
the villain's name will be revealed.

1627
00:56:46,346 --> 00:56:47,710
Then we can catch him.

1628
00:56:48,014 --> 00:56:50,680
The witness must obtain a hint about the villains...

1629
00:56:50,684 --> 00:56:52,380
and attend the trial.

1630
00:56:52,385 --> 00:56:55,080
The witness will show evidence.

1631
00:56:55,088 --> 00:56:56,420
(The witness must find evidence.)

1632
00:56:56,423 --> 00:56:59,750
If the witness is eliminated, the evidence won't be available.

1633
00:56:59,759 --> 00:57:01,890
(Then the villains win.)

1634
00:57:01,895 --> 00:57:04,660
Please go to your starting point.

1635
00:57:04,664 --> 00:57:06,160
- Let's get it. - Okay.

1636
00:57:06,166 --> 00:57:09,330
(Which team will win?)

1637
00:57:09,335 --> 00:57:10,900
Where are you going?

1638
00:57:11,171 --> 00:57:13,500
Why, Mr. Villain?

1639
00:57:13,506 --> 00:57:17,210
Why is everyone suspecting me as a villain?

1640
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:18,570
- Who do you think it is? - What?

1641
00:57:18,578 --> 00:57:20,140
I made up my mind.

1642
00:57:20,146 --> 00:57:21,510
(Se Chan has a conclusion.)

1643
00:57:21,514 --> 00:57:23,210
- The villain is... - One of them is Jong Kook.

1644
00:57:23,216 --> 00:57:24,950
(Jong Kook has been suspicious.)

1645
00:57:24,951 --> 00:57:26,210
- Pardon? - Jong Kook.

1646
00:57:26,219 --> 00:57:27,920
- He's definitely it. - There's Gwi Hwa.

1647
00:57:27,921 --> 00:57:29,090
(He's startled.)

1648
00:57:29,856 --> 00:57:31,560
Why are you eavesdropping?

1649
00:57:32,058 --> 00:57:34,160
Gwi Hwa, you're a villain.

1650
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,690
I'm a detective.

1651
00:57:36,696 --> 00:57:37,690
Me too.

1652
00:57:37,697 --> 00:57:39,760
What are you talking about?

1653
00:57:39,766 --> 00:57:41,670
Detectives received the mission this morning.

1654
00:57:42,402 --> 00:57:43,930
- Which mission? - Mission for detectives.

1655
00:57:43,937 --> 00:57:45,030
I got it too.

1656
00:57:45,038 --> 00:57:46,900
What do you mean? I received it.

1657
00:57:46,906 --> 00:57:48,170
Where did you get it?

1658
00:57:48,174 --> 00:57:50,240
- It was in Ilsan. - Where in Ilsan?

1659
00:57:50,243 --> 00:57:52,040
- In the parking lot. - You're lying.

1660
00:57:52,045 --> 00:57:53,610
You might hit me.

1661
00:57:53,613 --> 00:57:56,410
(He's about to lose his temper.)

1662
00:57:56,416 --> 00:57:58,180
- You might hit me. - Where did you get it?

1663
00:57:58,184 --> 00:58:00,080
- Pardon? - Where did you get the mission?

1664
00:58:00,086 --> 00:58:01,550
(He takes off his jacket.)

1665
00:58:01,554 --> 00:58:03,020
- Put it back on. - Why are you lying?

1666
00:58:03,022 --> 00:58:04,390
I'm really a detective.

1667
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:05,390
(Is it true or false?)

1668
00:58:05,391 --> 00:58:06,420
- Are you... - I can't believe it.

1669
00:58:06,426 --> 00:58:08,320
Where did you get the mission?

1670
00:58:08,328 --> 00:58:09,860
Let's say it at the same time.

1671
00:58:09,863 --> 00:58:11,190
- I'll be honest. - Me too.

1672
00:58:11,197 --> 00:58:13,230
- Let's say it. - In 1, 2, 3.

1673
00:58:13,233 --> 00:58:16,060
- At a coffee shop. - Shop.

1674
00:58:16,069 --> 00:58:17,900
(Which shop?)

1675
00:58:17,904 --> 00:58:19,200
(Is he really a detective?)

1676
00:58:19,205 --> 00:58:21,210
I'm really a detective.

1677
00:58:21,574 --> 00:58:22,670
I'll keep my eye on you.

1678
00:58:22,675 --> 00:58:24,240
- It must be true. - Yes.

1679
00:58:24,244 --> 00:58:25,240
(Is Gwi Hwa a detective?)

1680
00:58:25,245 --> 00:58:27,040
- At a coffee shop? - Let's verify.

1681
00:58:27,046 --> 00:58:28,780
Once we find a hint...

1682
00:58:28,782 --> 00:58:30,680
Okay, I hope you find it.

1683
00:58:30,683 --> 00:58:32,350
- Okay. - He must be a detective.

1684
00:58:32,652 --> 00:58:33,920
Sung Tae is a detective.

1685
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,580
(They must identify who is who.)

1686
00:58:35,588 --> 00:58:36,650
And...

1687
00:58:37,223 --> 00:58:38,760
Jae Seok is a villain.

1688
00:58:39,159 --> 00:58:41,660
I'm not sure about what Sang Yeob is.

1689
00:58:45,131 --> 00:58:46,590
Gwi Hwa...

1690
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:47,800
(He guesses the villains.)

1691
00:58:47,801 --> 00:58:48,800
Kwang Soo?

1692
00:58:48,802 --> 00:58:51,700
They keep saying that they're detectives.

1693
00:58:52,005 --> 00:58:53,500
It seems suspicious.

1694
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,140
They might be creating a confusion.

1695
00:58:57,310 --> 00:58:59,040
(Nervous)

1696
00:58:59,045 --> 00:59:00,580
The countdown starts.

1697
00:59:00,613 --> 00:59:05,120
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1698
00:59:05,852 --> 00:59:07,120
Race starts.

1699
00:59:07,854 --> 00:59:08,920
Let's find the hints.

1700
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:11,550
(The race starts.)

1701
00:59:11,558 --> 00:59:14,090
Where are the hints?

1702
00:59:14,961 --> 00:59:16,460
Where are the hints?

1703
00:59:17,063 --> 00:59:18,160
Hints.

1704
00:59:18,698 --> 00:59:19,690
Could it be here?

1705
00:59:19,699 --> 00:59:21,700
(The female members aren't the villains.)

1706
00:59:21,701 --> 00:59:24,270
I found a hint in a place like this.

1707
00:59:24,804 --> 00:59:27,210
(Where are the hints?)

1708
00:59:31,511 --> 00:59:33,780
(So Min finds a hint.)

1709
00:59:38,418 --> 00:59:40,687
(So Min finds a hint.)

1710
00:59:42,589 --> 00:59:43,756
(Hint about Detective A)

1711
00:59:43,756 --> 00:59:47,360
"Detective A is over 180cm tall."

1712
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,561
(Sung Tae, Gwi Hwa, Sang Yeob, or Kwang Soo)

1713
00:59:48,561 --> 00:59:49,629
Detective A?

1714
00:59:51,364 --> 00:59:52,465
Here it is.

1715
00:59:53,967 --> 00:59:57,003
(Sung Tae finds a hint.)

1716
00:59:58,738 --> 01:00:00,874
"Detective A is a guest"?

1717
01:00:00,874 --> 01:00:03,543
("Detective A is a guest"?)

1718
01:00:03,543 --> 01:00:07,480
(Sung Tae, Gwi Hwa, Sang Yeob, or Bo Gyeol)

1719
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,048
"Detective A is a guest."

1720
01:00:09,048 --> 01:00:10,950
(When two hints are combined,)

1721
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:14,087
(Detective A is either Gwi Hwa, Sung Tae, or Sang Yeob.)

1722
01:00:15,388 --> 01:00:16,389
(The hints narrow down the choices.)

1723
01:00:16,389 --> 01:00:17,891
- The prize is 3,000 dollars. - Yes.

1724
01:00:18,191 --> 01:00:20,493
If the villains win, they split the prize.

1725
01:00:22,262 --> 01:00:25,265
(Kwang Soo finds a hint.)

1726
01:00:27,033 --> 01:00:28,301
Let's see it together.

1727
01:00:28,301 --> 01:00:29,702
No, you could be a villain.

1728
01:00:29,702 --> 01:00:31,471
- What? - Let me look first.

1729
01:00:31,471 --> 01:00:34,140
Come on, stop playing.

1730
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:36,075
"Stop playing"?

1731
01:00:36,075 --> 01:00:37,911
- Let's read it together. - Stay away.

1732
01:00:38,011 --> 01:00:40,914
Fine, but how can you suspect me?

1733
01:00:41,014 --> 01:00:42,215
Let's read it together.

1734
01:00:42,815 --> 01:00:47,120
(The hint that Kwang Soo finds...)

1735
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,121
(is related to the villains.)

1736
01:00:48,121 --> 01:00:49,956
(Villain B's name has a J.)

1737
01:00:49,956 --> 01:00:53,660
(Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, or So Min)

1738
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,395
- "Villain B..." - You aren't one of them.

1739
01:00:55,395 --> 01:00:56,562
"Has a J."

1740
01:00:56,562 --> 01:00:58,164
(Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Jong Kook, Ji Hyo or So Min)

1741
01:00:58,164 --> 01:00:59,766
- These two aren't it. - No.

1742
01:00:59,766 --> 01:01:02,568
It can't be Seok Jin. It's either Jae Seok or Jong Kook.

1743
01:01:02,568 --> 01:01:04,938
(Suspects are Jae Seok, Seok Jin, or Jong Kook.)

1744
01:01:06,606 --> 01:01:07,874
- What is it? - What?

1745
01:01:07,874 --> 01:01:08,975
What?

1746
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:12,245
- I'm scared of you. - Me? Why all of a sudden?

1747
01:01:12,946 --> 01:01:14,480
Who do you think it is?

1748
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,648
(They stay away from Jong Kook.)

1749
01:01:15,648 --> 01:01:17,050
It could be Jae Seok or Gwi Hwa.

1750
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:19,385
(They keep a distance.)

1751
01:01:19,585 --> 01:01:21,454
- What's wrong? - Nothing.

1752
01:01:21,454 --> 01:01:23,089
Can you only eliminate the witness?

1753
01:01:23,356 --> 01:01:25,425
- What? - Can you eliminate the witness?

1754
01:01:25,425 --> 01:01:26,759
Why would I?

1755
01:01:26,759 --> 01:01:28,261
(They suspect him.)

1756
01:01:28,261 --> 01:01:29,262
- Why would I? - Or protect the witness?

1757
01:01:29,262 --> 01:01:30,496
- Why would I? - It's nothing.

1758
01:01:30,496 --> 01:01:32,165
Did you find a hint about me?

1759
01:01:32,165 --> 01:01:33,366
- We found a hint. - We did.

1760
01:01:33,366 --> 01:01:34,500
What did it say?

1761
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,035
- It's unfair. - In the villain's name,

1762
01:01:36,035 --> 01:01:37,070
there's a J.

1763
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:39,439
There are so many names with that letter.

1764
01:01:39,439 --> 01:01:40,873
- There are only three. - But...

1765
01:01:40,873 --> 01:01:43,643
- It's not certain. - Hello, Detective.

1766
01:01:43,743 --> 01:01:45,645
(A detective-like person arrives.)

1767
01:01:45,912 --> 01:01:47,080
- Detective. - Yes?

1768
01:01:47,113 --> 01:01:49,048
- Is he a detective? - You can eliminate him.

1769
01:01:49,148 --> 01:01:50,350
Eliminate him.

1770
01:01:50,483 --> 01:01:51,517
(If a detective eliminates the witness, the civilians lose.)

1771
01:01:51,517 --> 01:01:54,454
Why do you suspect me to be a villain?

1772
01:01:54,454 --> 01:01:55,455
(If a detective eliminates the witness, civilians lose.)

1773
01:01:55,455 --> 01:01:56,522
Be careful, Jong Kook.

1774
01:01:57,056 --> 01:01:58,458
Will you tear off his name tag?

1775
01:01:58,458 --> 01:02:00,460
What? You're a detective.

1776
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:02,595
You must be certain...

1777
01:02:02,595 --> 01:02:04,297
- to eliminate someone. - Right.

1778
01:02:04,297 --> 01:02:05,698
What happens if he's a civilian?

1779
01:02:05,698 --> 01:02:07,033
- Why do you suspect me? - Don't we lose?

1780
01:02:07,033 --> 01:02:08,568
(It's hard to make a move.)

1781
01:02:08,568 --> 01:02:09,936
Let's split for now.

1782
01:02:09,936 --> 01:02:11,204
- Okay. - Let's go.

1783
01:02:11,838 --> 01:02:14,507
Whom do you suspect, Kwang Soo?

1784
01:02:14,507 --> 01:02:16,976
(Is Gwi Hwa a detective and Jong Kook a villain?)

1785
01:02:18,077 --> 01:02:21,214
Which floor are you going, Gwi Hwa?

1786
01:02:21,214 --> 01:02:22,582
- Which floor? - Let's go upstairs.

1787
01:02:22,582 --> 01:02:23,649
- Shall we? - Okay.

1788
01:02:24,917 --> 01:02:25,918
Are you going upstairs?

1789
01:02:25,918 --> 01:02:27,653
(Are they staying together?)

1790
01:02:27,653 --> 01:02:29,188
Can a villain eliminate a detective?

1791
01:02:29,589 --> 01:02:31,324
- What? - That's not possible, right?

1792
01:02:31,324 --> 01:02:32,959
- That's not possible. - No.

1793
01:02:33,159 --> 01:02:34,927
- Then you may go. - Gwi Hwa.

1794
01:02:34,927 --> 01:02:37,463
(Kwang Soo feels relieved.)

1795
01:02:37,463 --> 01:02:39,432
- No. - Wait for me.

1796
01:02:39,432 --> 01:02:40,767
What's wrong with you?

1797
01:02:40,767 --> 01:02:42,135
- I'm trying to find out. - What's wrong with you?

1798
01:02:42,135 --> 01:02:44,704
There are many with Js in their names.

1799
01:02:44,704 --> 01:02:46,572
- He's calling for trouble. - Gwi Hwa.

1800
01:02:46,572 --> 01:02:48,508
I'll tell you the hint that I found.

1801
01:02:48,508 --> 01:02:51,244
You should be careful of him for now.

1802
01:02:51,244 --> 01:02:53,212
- Okay. - Goodness.

1803
01:02:53,846 --> 01:02:54,847
Salute, Detective.

1804
01:02:54,847 --> 01:02:56,315
(He expresses his loyalty.)

1805
01:02:56,315 --> 01:02:57,417
(Trust me.)

1806
01:02:57,417 --> 01:02:58,484
See you.

1807
01:02:58,651 --> 01:03:03,089
(He walks away without realizing what he's done.)

1808
01:03:05,291 --> 01:03:07,493
The villains are male, right?

1809
01:03:08,027 --> 01:03:09,462
- They're men. - Right.

1810
01:03:09,462 --> 01:03:10,863
- The villains are men. - Okay.

1811
01:03:10,863 --> 01:03:12,498
(He decides to share the hint with them.)

1812
01:03:12,498 --> 01:03:14,233
I'm being very generous.

1813
01:03:14,233 --> 01:03:15,968
- We have one too. - Us too.

1814
01:03:15,968 --> 01:03:17,070
- We'll help you. - Do you trust me?

1815
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:18,504
- Of course. - We do.

1816
01:03:18,504 --> 01:03:20,673
I'll identify myself to you.

1817
01:03:20,673 --> 01:03:21,741
Are you a witness?

1818
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:25,378
- Do you have a badge? - Please trust me.

1819
01:03:25,378 --> 01:03:27,246
(Is he revealing his identity?)

1820
01:03:27,246 --> 01:03:34,153
(Haha's identity is...)

1821
01:03:34,153 --> 01:03:38,324
(A private investigator)

1822
01:03:38,324 --> 01:03:39,759
(My goodness)

1823
01:03:39,759 --> 01:03:41,761
- Come on. - I'm a private investigator.

1824
01:03:41,761 --> 01:03:44,130
Show us the hint now.

1825
01:03:44,163 --> 01:03:46,299
- Show us the hint. - Okay.

1826
01:03:46,365 --> 01:03:47,700
- Show me yours at the same time. - Okay.

1827
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:51,604
Detective A is over 180cm tall.

1828
01:03:52,271 --> 01:03:54,307
Detective A's name doesn't end with consonants.

1829
01:03:55,374 --> 01:03:59,312
(Detective A's name doesn't end with consonants.)

1830
01:03:59,378 --> 01:04:02,081
(When these three hints are combined,)

1831
01:04:03,816 --> 01:04:05,585
(it's narrowed down to one person.)

1832
01:04:05,585 --> 01:04:09,655
Hey, the detective has to be Gwi Hwa.

1833
01:04:09,655 --> 01:04:11,624
For sure. He's Detective A.

1834
01:04:11,624 --> 01:04:15,128
(Gwi Hwa is Detective A.)

1835
01:04:15,128 --> 01:04:18,364
(Gwi Hwa is a homicide detective.)

1836
01:04:18,364 --> 01:04:20,199
I'm a detective.

1837
01:04:23,369 --> 01:04:24,370
(Earlier today)

1838
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:27,540
Today's special is Bad Guys: War against the Villains.

1839
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:30,476
The two of you are detectives who can arrest the villains.

1840
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:32,078
I'm a detective?

1841
01:04:32,078 --> 01:04:33,779
(Me?)

1842
01:04:33,779 --> 01:04:39,752
(That's how he became a Running Man detective overnight.)

1843
01:04:40,887 --> 01:04:43,122
(He returns to his office for a moment.)

1844
01:04:43,122 --> 01:04:44,857
Excuse me.

1845
01:04:45,858 --> 01:04:47,126
Please stay.

1846
01:04:47,326 --> 01:04:48,694
You need to cover me.

1847
01:04:48,694 --> 01:04:50,096
(He's undercover right now.)

1848
01:04:51,697 --> 01:04:54,734
(I got you.)

1849
01:04:55,701 --> 01:04:57,870
(No, don't cover the camera.)

1850
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:59,605
No.

1851
01:05:00,039 --> 01:05:01,474
I'll pretend like I'm asking you a question.

1852
01:05:01,474 --> 01:05:03,109
(He gives up going undercover.)

1853
01:05:03,109 --> 01:05:05,611
(Good luck, Detective.)

1854
01:05:06,212 --> 01:05:08,481
(He looks around.)

1855
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:12,552
They usually hide something here.

1856
01:05:12,552 --> 01:05:14,787
(There must be a hint here.)

1857
01:05:19,892 --> 01:05:22,195
(There's no hint,)

1858
01:05:22,195 --> 01:05:26,165
(but Jong Kook is here.)

1859
01:05:28,367 --> 01:05:29,569
What are you doing?

1860
01:05:29,569 --> 01:05:32,138
(Peekaboo)

1861
01:05:33,706 --> 01:05:34,874
- Sit down. - I'm sorry.

1862
01:05:34,907 --> 01:05:36,008
No, have a seat.

1863
01:05:36,342 --> 01:05:38,544
- Sit down. I know. - Jong Kook.

1864
01:05:38,544 --> 01:05:39,712
Sit.

1865
01:05:40,446 --> 01:05:42,215
Sit.

1866
01:05:42,215 --> 01:05:45,051
(Is Jong Kook a villain?)

1867
01:05:45,051 --> 01:05:46,652
- I'm not the witness. - You are.

1868
01:05:46,652 --> 01:05:48,154
(He's certain.)

1869
01:05:48,154 --> 01:05:52,625
(Is Jong Kook a villain who's looking for a witness?)

1870
01:05:53,826 --> 01:05:55,895
Here it is. Nobody's been here yet.

1871
01:05:55,895 --> 01:05:56,963
(Seok Jin finds a hint.)

1872
01:05:57,897 --> 01:06:00,600
"Villain B is not married."

1873
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:04,303
(This is an additional hint about Villain B.)

1874
01:06:04,303 --> 01:06:07,807
(Both of these hints...)

1875
01:06:07,807 --> 01:06:11,010
(point to Jong Kook.)

1876
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:12,678
(Kim Jong Kook)

1877
01:06:12,878 --> 01:06:14,013
I have to...

1878
01:06:14,013 --> 01:06:15,147
(They're annoying.)

1879
01:06:15,147 --> 01:06:16,382
I have to eliminate the witness.

1880
01:06:16,382 --> 01:06:17,783
(He needs to get rid of them.)

1881
01:06:17,783 --> 01:06:20,786
I think Kwang Soo is the witness.

1882
01:06:21,153 --> 01:06:22,989
I have a feeling.

1883
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:25,124
I'm not the witness.

1884
01:06:25,124 --> 01:06:26,225
You are.

1885
01:06:26,225 --> 01:06:28,561
(I have to eliminate you.)

1886
01:06:28,561 --> 01:06:29,562
(What's wrong with him?)

1887
01:06:29,562 --> 01:06:32,131
This is like a scene from a film.

1888
01:06:32,131 --> 01:06:33,633
(It's a thriller.)

1889
01:06:33,766 --> 01:06:35,067
- Will I die? - What?

1890
01:06:35,067 --> 01:06:36,902
(I can't even do anything.)

1891
01:06:37,903 --> 01:06:39,171
All right.

1892
01:06:39,171 --> 01:06:43,242
(If he is the witness, the villains win, and the race is over.)

1893
01:06:43,242 --> 01:06:44,243
I'm really not...

1894
01:06:44,243 --> 01:06:46,445
(This is not fair.)

1895
01:06:46,445 --> 01:06:47,847
(Before he gets eliminated...)

1896
01:06:47,847 --> 01:06:48,948
Gwi Hwa!

1897
01:06:48,948 --> 01:06:52,318
(Detective Choi is here.)

1898
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:53,953
- Gwi Hwa! - Hey.

1899
01:06:53,953 --> 01:06:55,254
Who's this?

1900
01:06:55,288 --> 01:06:57,390
(Save me, Detective!)

1901
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:59,025
(Hold onto him.)

1902
01:06:59,025 --> 01:07:00,493
- Hold onto him. - Rip it!

1903
01:07:00,493 --> 01:07:02,194
(Kwang Soo has Jong Kook's hands tied.)

1904
01:07:02,194 --> 01:07:05,264
(He tries to oppress the brutal villain.)

1905
01:07:05,264 --> 01:07:06,632
- Rip it! - Hold onto him.

1906
01:07:06,632 --> 01:07:07,733
(Ripping)

1907
01:07:09,835 --> 01:07:11,904
(They eliminate Jong Kook.)

1908
01:07:11,904 --> 01:07:13,673
- Rip it! - Hold onto him.

1909
01:07:13,773 --> 01:07:15,775
- I got him. - You got him.

1910
01:07:15,975 --> 01:07:17,677
- You got him. - Kwang Soo.

1911
01:07:17,677 --> 01:07:19,145
I almost got eliminated.

1912
01:07:19,278 --> 01:07:20,780
Thank you.

1913
01:07:20,846 --> 01:07:22,982
- Thank you, Detective Choi. - Detective?

1914
01:07:23,049 --> 01:07:24,717
- Detective Choi. - Thank you.

1915
01:07:24,784 --> 01:07:26,018
Thank you, sir.

1916
01:07:26,052 --> 01:07:27,887
- All right. - He grabbed my name tag.

1917
01:07:29,889 --> 01:07:32,291
We got him. He's arrested.

1918
01:07:32,358 --> 01:07:34,660
How did you know he was a villain?

1919
01:07:35,161 --> 01:07:36,762
I have instincts.

1920
01:07:36,762 --> 01:07:39,265
I was following him around.

1921
01:07:39,265 --> 01:07:40,333
(Jong Kook kept tailing Kwang Soo.)

1922
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:42,935
He kept on following Kwang Soo.

1923
01:07:43,602 --> 01:07:44,904
(Upset)

1924
01:07:44,904 --> 01:07:46,639
- Gosh. - You got caught here.

1925
01:07:46,806 --> 01:07:49,542
- That was so close. - What a timing.

1926
01:07:49,542 --> 01:07:51,177
You're like an anaconda.

1927
01:07:51,177 --> 01:07:52,511
I didn't know it was you.

1928
01:07:52,511 --> 01:07:54,280
(Villains versus detectives)

1929
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,449
Villain Kim Jong Kook is out.

1930
01:07:56,449 --> 01:07:58,317
(How will this race end?)

1931
01:07:59,819 --> 01:08:03,756
Villain Kim Jong Kook is out.

1932
01:08:03,756 --> 01:08:05,157
Jong Kook is out?

1933
01:08:06,258 --> 01:08:07,426
My gosh.

1934
01:08:07,426 --> 01:08:08,661
Jong Kook is out?

1935
01:08:09,528 --> 01:08:11,964
(They're not shocked that he was a villain,)

1936
01:08:11,964 --> 01:08:14,834
(but that he's out.)

1937
01:08:14,834 --> 01:08:17,603
(They have to find Villain A now.)

1938
01:08:17,603 --> 01:08:19,372
We have to find Villain A.

1939
01:08:19,372 --> 01:08:22,475
(They have to find Villain A now.)

1940
01:08:22,975 --> 01:08:24,276
My head is about to explode.

1941
01:08:24,276 --> 01:08:25,344
(He's about to cry.)

1942
01:08:26,112 --> 01:08:27,880
(He's anxious.)

1943
01:08:29,415 --> 01:08:30,649
Why does nobody...

1944
01:08:32,051 --> 01:08:35,154
have any hints about the witness?

1945
01:08:36,889 --> 01:08:39,024
We have to know the witness.

1946
01:08:41,627 --> 01:08:42,862
Sang Yeob.

1947
01:08:43,562 --> 01:08:44,997
It's too obvious though...

1948
01:08:44,997 --> 01:08:46,432
if it's him.

1949
01:08:46,432 --> 01:08:48,367
(Is Sang Yeob looking for the witness?)

1950
01:08:48,367 --> 01:08:49,769
It can't be anybody else.

1951
01:08:49,835 --> 01:08:50,970
Is it Se Chan?

1952
01:08:54,173 --> 01:08:55,775
(She bumps into somebody while thinking about the villains.)

1953
01:08:55,775 --> 01:08:57,576
- I'm here to find hints. Why? - Come.

1954
01:08:57,576 --> 01:08:59,945
(She bumps into somebody while thinking about the villains.)

1955
01:08:59,945 --> 01:09:02,548
(What?)

1956
01:09:02,548 --> 01:09:06,385
(She was gone with a cry.)

1957
01:09:06,385 --> 01:09:10,189
Civilian Jeon So Min is out.

1958
01:09:10,256 --> 01:09:11,490
What?

1959
01:09:11,624 --> 01:09:12,958
- What did he say? - What did he say?

1960
01:09:12,958 --> 01:09:14,293
Here's a hint...

1961
01:09:14,293 --> 01:09:16,929
- about Villain A. - Civilian Jeon So Min is out?

1962
01:09:16,929 --> 01:09:18,898
(An innocent civilian is out, so here's a hint about Villain A.)

1963
01:09:18,898 --> 01:09:22,601
Villain A got an award as a rookie.

1964
01:09:22,601 --> 01:09:24,970
(Villain A got an award as a rookie.)

1965
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:27,273
A trial is starting soon.

1966
01:09:27,306 --> 01:09:29,708
- Please head to court. - Let's go.

1967
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:30,776
I don't know who it is.

1968
01:09:30,776 --> 01:09:32,344
(Round 1 finishes as So Min gets eliminated.)

1969
01:09:33,245 --> 01:09:34,647
(1st trial begins.)

1970
01:09:34,647 --> 01:09:37,183
We'll start with the first trial.

1971
01:09:37,183 --> 01:09:40,419
The person with the majority of votes will be on trial.

1972
01:09:40,586 --> 01:09:42,588
If that person is a villain,

1973
01:09:42,588 --> 01:09:44,824
the race is over.

1974
01:09:44,857 --> 01:09:47,493
If not, we'll move ahead to the next round.

1975
01:09:47,493 --> 01:09:49,995
If you don't catch the villain in the second trial as well,

1976
01:09:49,995 --> 01:09:52,398
even if all of you are alive,

1977
01:09:52,398 --> 01:09:53,632
the civilians lose.

1978
01:09:53,632 --> 01:09:55,901
(If they can't catch the villain by the 2nd trial,)

1979
01:09:55,901 --> 01:09:58,304
(the civilians lose.)

1980
01:09:58,971 --> 01:10:00,840
As a detective, let me say something.

1981
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,409
(He talks out of nowhere.)

1982
01:10:03,409 --> 01:10:05,644
- How are you the detective? - All right.

1983
01:10:05,644 --> 01:10:07,980
We don't know if you're the detective yet.

1984
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:09,415
I know Gwi Hwa is,

1985
01:10:09,415 --> 01:10:10,850
but I don't know about you.

1986
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:12,751
When they were eliminating Jong Kook,

1987
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:14,420
Gwi Hwa took the lead.

1988
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:18,290
But Jae Seok got scared, so he stayed behind.

1989
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:20,626
- Why would a detective do that? - You're wrong.

1990
01:10:20,626 --> 01:10:22,828
You're mistaken.

1991
01:10:22,828 --> 01:10:24,530
He's not a villain,

1992
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:27,132
because we both got the mission this morning.

1993
01:10:27,132 --> 01:10:28,834
(This is what the detective says.)

1994
01:10:28,834 --> 01:10:30,035
So is he...

1995
01:10:30,035 --> 01:10:31,704
- They're both detectives. - Is he a detective?

1996
01:10:31,737 --> 01:10:32,805
Is he?

1997
01:10:32,805 --> 01:10:34,139
Right on.

1998
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,407
Right on. Hey.

1999
01:10:35,541 --> 01:10:37,409
You should have told them earlier.

2000
01:10:37,409 --> 01:10:38,544
(They both got the mission, so he is a detective.)

2001
01:10:39,345 --> 01:10:42,515
The two of you are detectives who can arrest the villains.

2002
01:10:42,982 --> 01:10:44,149
I'm a detective?

2003
01:10:44,149 --> 01:10:45,718
(Like Gwi Hwa said, Jae Seok is also a detective.)

2004
01:10:45,718 --> 01:10:48,954
At the final race, if a villain survives,

2005
01:10:48,954 --> 01:10:52,157
- the villains win. - My gosh.

2006
01:10:52,858 --> 01:10:54,860
- You know what he means, right? - I'm not sure.

2007
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:57,763
(I'm actually not sure.)

2008
01:10:57,763 --> 01:11:02,167
(These two are a team.)

2009
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:04,436
(Cowardly Detective Yu makes a comment.)

2010
01:11:04,436 --> 01:11:05,971
The hint I have says that...

2011
01:11:06,305 --> 01:11:07,940
they are film actors...

2012
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:09,875
and that they won a Rookie of the Year award.

2013
01:11:10,075 --> 01:11:11,610
We know these hints.

2014
01:11:12,011 --> 01:11:14,747
- It comes down to two people. - Who?

2015
01:11:14,747 --> 01:11:15,948
Sang Yeob and Kwang Soo.

2016
01:11:15,948 --> 01:11:18,450
(The suspects are Sang Yeob and Kwang Soo.)

2017
01:11:18,984 --> 01:11:20,152
He got an award?

2018
01:11:20,152 --> 01:11:21,487
- He... - Hold on.

2019
01:11:21,487 --> 01:11:22,588
Rookie of the Year award?

2020
01:11:22,588 --> 01:11:23,989
- He did. - Really?

2021
01:11:23,989 --> 01:11:25,190
- You got one? - Yes.

2022
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:26,358
(Both of them got the Rookie of the Year award.)

2023
01:11:26,358 --> 01:11:27,760
It didn't even occur to me.

2024
01:11:28,761 --> 01:11:30,329
Have you made up your minds?

2025
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:31,664
- Can I have one person... - Hold on.

2026
01:11:31,664 --> 01:11:33,365
Can we hear the closing arguments?

2027
01:11:33,365 --> 01:11:35,668
I want to hear from Kwang Soo...

2028
01:11:35,668 --> 01:11:38,237
and Sang Yeob who got the award.

2029
01:11:38,237 --> 01:11:39,471
It's the closing arguments.

2030
01:11:39,471 --> 01:11:41,674
- I... - One at a time. Go, Kwang Soo.

2031
01:11:41,674 --> 01:11:45,110
I think this is a coincidence.

2032
01:11:46,111 --> 01:11:47,646
I'll just say one thing.

2033
01:11:47,646 --> 01:11:49,248
The scene.

2034
01:11:49,248 --> 01:11:50,816
Detective Choi and Detective Yu.

2035
01:11:51,216 --> 01:11:52,685
You both saw it. They are my witnesses.

2036
01:11:53,118 --> 01:11:55,254
When I was about to get eliminated,

2037
01:11:55,888 --> 01:11:58,490
- the detectives saved me. - That's right.

2038
01:11:58,490 --> 01:12:00,993
- Is that true? - Yes.

2039
01:12:01,293 --> 01:12:03,128
- You scared me. What's wrong? - Hold on.

2040
01:12:03,762 --> 01:12:05,431
(Did he just think of something?)

2041
01:12:05,431 --> 01:12:06,632
What's wrong?

2042
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:08,167
Hold on.

2043
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:10,402
- What? - I was after Jong Kook.

2044
01:12:10,402 --> 01:12:11,537
And?

2045
01:12:11,971 --> 01:12:14,974
And then I lost him because he went into a room.

2046
01:12:15,007 --> 01:12:16,141
And?

2047
01:12:16,175 --> 01:12:18,811
Then I met those two. What I saw was...

2048
01:12:18,811 --> 01:12:21,380
Jong Kook was making Kwang Soo sit...

2049
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:23,248
and was about to rip his name tag.

2050
01:12:23,248 --> 01:12:30,889
(Detective Choi saw Jong Kook about to eliminate Kwang Soo.)

2051
01:12:31,023 --> 01:12:32,524
They could have been acting.

2052
01:12:32,524 --> 01:12:37,062
- That's what I'm saying. - You think they were acting?

2053
01:12:37,062 --> 01:12:39,231
Detective Choi, they could have waited for you.

2054
01:12:39,231 --> 01:12:40,332
- That's right. - Because...

2055
01:12:40,332 --> 01:12:42,368
Jong Kook was trying to protect Kwang Soo.

2056
01:12:42,368 --> 01:12:43,869
He wanted to save Kwang Soo.

2057
01:12:43,869 --> 01:12:45,404
Jong Kook knew he couldn't win.

2058
01:12:45,404 --> 01:12:46,639
- That's it. - That's it.

2059
01:12:46,639 --> 01:12:48,073
He got himself out.

2060
01:12:48,073 --> 01:12:49,341
- That's right. - This is no joke.

2061
01:12:49,341 --> 01:12:50,843
- That's not... - Gwi Hwa guessed right.

2062
01:12:50,843 --> 01:12:52,611
- That's possible. - He was laughing...

2063
01:12:52,611 --> 01:12:54,346
- for some reason. - That's also possible.

2064
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:57,583
You said it yesterday. Who was on standby at 7am?

2065
01:12:57,583 --> 01:12:59,618
- Right. - That was...

2066
01:12:59,618 --> 01:13:00,719
(Is Kwang Soo really Villain A?)

2067
01:13:01,387 --> 01:13:03,288
Let's hear Sang Yeob's closing argument.

2068
01:13:03,288 --> 01:13:04,523
(This is his closing argument.)

2069
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:08,527
I don't have much to say,

2070
01:13:09,328 --> 01:13:12,197
but I cooperated with Haha.

2071
01:13:12,197 --> 01:13:15,634
And during that time, it was just the two of us.

2072
01:13:15,634 --> 01:13:18,037
If I was the villain, I would have ripped his name tag.

2073
01:13:18,303 --> 01:13:19,738
But I didn't.

2074
01:13:19,772 --> 01:13:21,106
He's sitting right before us.

2075
01:13:22,441 --> 01:13:25,044
- If Haha is the detective... - No.

2076
01:13:25,044 --> 01:13:27,046
If Haha is the witness,

2077
01:13:27,046 --> 01:13:29,314
Sang Yeob could have eliminated him as the villain.

2078
01:13:29,748 --> 01:13:33,118
He has no reason to eliminate civilians or detectives.

2079
01:13:33,118 --> 01:13:34,186
So that's how this will go.

2080
01:13:34,186 --> 01:13:36,522
It's time to decide.

2081
01:13:36,522 --> 01:13:37,756
You have no more time.

2082
01:13:38,223 --> 01:13:41,060
Let's have one of them go on trial.

2083
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:43,328
(It's time to pick one person.)

2084
01:13:43,328 --> 01:13:44,630
Who do you think it is, Sung Tae?

2085
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:46,298
Sang Yeob.

2086
01:13:46,865 --> 01:13:48,267
- That's right. - Sang Yeob?

2087
01:13:48,267 --> 01:13:49,702
What about you, Detective Choi?

2088
01:13:50,169 --> 01:13:51,870
I'm certain it's Kwang Soo.

2089
01:13:52,037 --> 01:13:53,305
- You saw me. - What about...

2090
01:13:53,572 --> 01:13:55,107
I think he was acting.

2091
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:57,076
- What about you, Se Chan? - Is it Kwang Soo?

2092
01:13:57,076 --> 01:13:58,877
Are you certain, Detective Choi?

2093
01:13:58,877 --> 01:14:00,379
- Yes. - Really?

2094
01:14:00,379 --> 01:14:03,382
Come to think of it, what I saw looked too artificial.

2095
01:14:03,382 --> 01:14:05,217
Jong Kook grabbed my name tag...

2096
01:14:05,217 --> 01:14:07,886
and twisted my arm when Gwi Hwa came in. He didn't know what to do.

2097
01:14:07,886 --> 01:14:09,088
- It's acting. - Yes.

2098
01:14:09,088 --> 01:14:10,255
- So it's acting. - "Yes"?

2099
01:14:10,255 --> 01:14:11,390
- Did you just say, "Yes"? - No, I mean...

2100
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:12,725
(Did you just say, "Yes"?)

2101
01:14:12,725 --> 01:14:13,792
(That's what you just said.)

2102
01:14:13,792 --> 01:14:15,694
- No, this is not acting. - It is.

2103
01:14:15,894 --> 01:14:17,863
He was acting, not me.

2104
01:14:17,863 --> 01:14:19,064
Jong Kook was acting by himself.

2105
01:14:19,064 --> 01:14:21,166
- Se Chan. - I choose Kwang Soo.

2106
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:23,135
- Listen to me. - Your remark wasn't convincing.

2107
01:14:23,135 --> 01:14:25,003
- You got it right. - Your closing argument.

2108
01:14:25,003 --> 01:14:26,238
- What about Ji Hyo? - You said you were acting.

2109
01:14:26,772 --> 01:14:29,074
I thought it was Sang Yeob,

2110
01:14:29,074 --> 01:14:31,677
but after hearing from Kwang Soo, I think it's him.

2111
01:14:31,677 --> 01:14:34,413
I've been arguing it's Kwang Soo all this time.

2112
01:14:34,813 --> 01:14:36,482
This doesn't make sense. Bo Gyeol,

2113
01:14:36,749 --> 01:14:38,317
think about me today.

2114
01:14:38,317 --> 01:14:40,085
- It's Sang Yeob. - Right.

2115
01:14:40,085 --> 01:14:41,186
What about you, Haha?

2116
01:14:41,353 --> 01:14:42,788
- Sang Yeob. - What?

2117
01:14:42,788 --> 01:14:43,922
Okay, I pick Sang Yeob.

2118
01:14:44,022 --> 01:14:46,759
Hold on. It's 4 to 3. Jae Seok has the final say.

2119
01:14:46,759 --> 01:14:48,360
It's up to Jae Seok.

2120
01:14:48,961 --> 01:14:49,962
Jae Seok.

2121
01:14:49,962 --> 01:14:51,130
(Jae Seok gets to decide who goes on trial.)

2122
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:53,398
- Detective Yu, may I say something? - Yes.

2123
01:14:53,432 --> 01:14:56,268
The scene I witnessed was awkward.

2124
01:14:56,769 --> 01:14:58,504
- I'm thinking about that too. - I have an instinct.

2125
01:14:58,504 --> 01:15:00,239
I didn't see it myself,

2126
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:03,342
so I have to rely on Detective Choi's words.

2127
01:15:03,342 --> 01:15:04,643
I heard what he said.

2128
01:15:04,643 --> 01:15:05,944
I'm an expert.

2129
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,246
He grabbed my name tag.

2130
01:15:07,246 --> 01:15:08,847
Okay, I'll follow Detective Choi's...

2131
01:15:08,847 --> 01:15:09,915
Hold on. Se Chan.

2132
01:15:09,915 --> 01:15:12,050
- Then... - You were with me all day.

2133
01:15:12,217 --> 01:15:14,253
It's Kwang Soo.

2134
01:15:14,253 --> 01:15:18,223
It's 5 to 3. Kwang Soo, please stand on the platform.

2135
01:15:18,223 --> 01:15:20,058
- It was a decisive moment. - It's okay, Kwang Soo.

2136
01:15:20,058 --> 01:15:21,794
It's Kwang Soo.

2137
01:15:22,494 --> 01:15:25,030
(It's the 1st judgment.)

2138
01:15:26,398 --> 01:15:28,700
I trusted you, detectives.

2139
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:30,102
(How could you do this?)

2140
01:15:30,135 --> 01:15:31,637
I tried my best today.

2141
01:15:31,637 --> 01:15:33,272
(I was loyal.)

2142
01:15:34,173 --> 01:15:36,975
- Are you certain? - He was acting.

2143
01:15:38,477 --> 01:15:40,579
In 1, 2...

2144
01:15:40,579 --> 01:15:42,314
(The majority chose Kwang Soo.)

2145
01:15:42,314 --> 01:15:46,685
(What is his identity?)

2146
01:15:46,685 --> 01:15:48,520
In 1, 2, 3.

2147
01:15:49,254 --> 01:15:51,290
(Kwang Soo is...)

2148
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:55,360
(a civilian.)

2149
01:15:55,494 --> 01:15:56,562
He's a civilian?

2150
01:15:56,562 --> 01:15:59,965
(He's disappointed.)

2151
01:16:01,633 --> 01:16:04,069
Why were you acting like that?

2152
01:16:04,303 --> 01:16:05,671
- Kwang Soo. - I got goosebumps.

2153
01:16:05,671 --> 01:16:06,939
I'm so sorry.

2154
01:16:07,239 --> 01:16:08,707
- Come on. - He's just a civilian.

2155
01:16:08,707 --> 01:16:10,442
I'm so sad you picked me.

2156
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:14,146
(If Kwang Soo is not the villain...)

2157
01:16:14,146 --> 01:16:15,447
It's you then.

2158
01:16:16,181 --> 01:16:19,685
(Is it Sang Yeob?)

2159
01:16:19,685 --> 01:16:20,886
(1st trial comes to an end with a mystery.)

2160
01:16:20,886 --> 01:16:24,890
You can go now. In 30 minutes, we'll hold the last trial.

2161
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:26,959
If you can't catch the villain, it's over.

2162
01:16:26,959 --> 01:16:27,993
(The last trial is in 30 minutes. The race resumes.)

2163
01:16:27,993 --> 01:16:29,494
- Detective Choi? - Yes.

2164
01:16:29,494 --> 01:16:31,196
I'll grab Sang Yeob. You can eliminate him.

2165
01:16:31,196 --> 01:16:33,699
(Everybody is after Sang Yeob.)

2166
01:16:33,765 --> 01:16:36,301
- Let's eliminate him and end this. - Okay.

2167
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:41,306
(If Sang Yeob is the remaining villain, the race will be over.)

2168
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,175
It's Sang Yeob.

2169
01:16:43,375 --> 01:16:44,776
From the hints we have,

2170
01:16:44,776 --> 01:16:46,845
it was Kwang Soo or Sang Yeob.

2171
01:16:46,945 --> 01:16:48,647
I told you to eliminate him if he's acting weird.

2172
01:16:48,647 --> 01:16:50,048
I never saw him.

2173
01:16:50,082 --> 01:16:51,283
Let's eliminate him.

2174
01:16:51,984 --> 01:16:54,786
- We have to eliminate him first. - Haven't you seen Sang Yeob?

2175
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:56,455
No, I haven't.

2176
01:16:56,455 --> 01:16:57,522
(The detectives are searching now.)

2177
01:16:57,522 --> 01:17:00,325
(Somebody is in a hurry.)

2178
01:17:00,359 --> 01:17:01,460
Where are you going?

2179
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,829
The ladies are not villains.

2180
01:17:03,896 --> 01:17:05,297
- No. - Right?

2181
01:17:05,664 --> 01:17:08,400
- I'm not a villain. - Right. The ladies are not.

2182
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,701
Where are you going?

2183
01:17:09,801 --> 01:17:12,104
I'm a witness.

2184
01:17:12,104 --> 01:17:13,805
(He looks around.)

2185
01:17:14,439 --> 01:17:15,707
- Stop lying. - I'm serious.

2186
01:17:15,707 --> 01:17:17,342
So I have to find it.

2187
01:17:17,409 --> 01:17:20,712
If you see Bo Gyeol or Gwi Hwa,

2188
01:17:20,979 --> 01:17:22,614
- tell them. - All right.

2189
01:17:22,614 --> 01:17:24,249
(Sung Tae says he's a witness.)

2190
01:17:24,249 --> 01:17:27,586
(These detectives are after Sang Yeob.)

2191
01:17:27,586 --> 01:17:29,288
- Go there. I'll go this way. - Okay.

2192
01:17:29,454 --> 01:17:32,591
(Where are you, Sang Yeob?)

2193
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:35,827
(What?)

2194
01:17:37,696 --> 01:17:41,967
(He finds Sang Yeob.)

2195
01:17:42,668 --> 01:17:43,902
What are you doing?

2196
01:17:44,136 --> 01:17:45,804
This...

2197
01:17:45,804 --> 01:17:46,939
Sang Yeob.

2198
01:17:47,239 --> 01:17:48,540
- Yes, Gwi Hwa. - Where is he?

2199
01:17:49,608 --> 01:17:50,742
Where is Sung Tae?

2200
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:52,678
- Sung Tae? - Yes.

2201
01:17:52,844 --> 01:17:54,279
I thought you came to catch me.

2202
01:17:54,279 --> 01:17:56,014
- No, it's not me. - Grab him.

2203
01:17:56,548 --> 01:17:58,216
(Get Sang Yeob.)

2204
01:17:58,216 --> 01:18:00,118
It's really not me.

2205
01:18:00,118 --> 01:18:01,520
(Sang Yeob finally gets caught.)

2206
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:05,023
(If he's the villain, this race will be over.)

2207
01:18:05,023 --> 01:18:06,325
It's really not me.

2208
01:18:06,458 --> 01:18:08,160
I'm a civilian.

2209
01:18:10,128 --> 01:18:13,899
(Sang Yeob is a civilian?)

2210
01:18:14,866 --> 01:18:16,001
What?

2211
01:18:16,268 --> 01:18:17,869
- Sang Yeob. - Yes.

2212
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:19,905
- He's a civilian? - Kwang Soo...

2213
01:18:20,205 --> 01:18:21,506
- It's either you or him. - Jae Seok.

2214
01:18:21,807 --> 01:18:24,643
Somebody is lying.

2215
01:18:27,045 --> 01:18:28,180
Sung Tae.

2216
01:18:28,613 --> 01:18:29,748
Sung Tae.

2217
01:18:29,881 --> 01:18:31,249
- What's this? - What is this?

2218
01:18:31,316 --> 01:18:32,451
What?

2219
01:18:32,784 --> 01:18:34,086
- What's this? - We got it.

2220
01:18:34,086 --> 01:18:35,454
It's Sang Yeob.

2221
01:18:35,454 --> 01:18:36,488
(Villain A has three syllables in their name.)

2222
01:18:36,488 --> 01:18:37,889
Where were you?

2223
01:18:37,889 --> 01:18:39,291
I was searching.

2224
01:18:39,458 --> 01:18:42,961
What if you get caught by Sang Yeob?

2225
01:18:43,628 --> 01:18:45,063
It's okay. I'm confident.

2226
01:18:45,063 --> 01:18:47,099
(He says something odd.)

2227
01:18:47,499 --> 01:18:49,134
(Sung Tae is so relaxed.)

2228
01:18:49,134 --> 01:18:50,969
- Hold on. - It could be him.

2229
01:18:51,003 --> 01:18:52,104
Sung Tae.

2230
01:18:52,337 --> 01:18:53,538
It's Sung Tae.

2231
01:18:53,605 --> 01:18:55,073
Why didn't we think about that?

2232
01:18:55,941 --> 01:18:58,076
The villain could have lied.

2233
01:18:58,410 --> 01:18:59,478
I'm sorry.

2234
01:18:59,478 --> 01:19:00,912
- I'm sorry, Sang Yeob. - I am...

2235
01:19:00,912 --> 01:19:02,514
- going home. - I'm sorry.

2236
01:19:02,781 --> 01:19:04,182
- I'm really sorry. - It's okay.

2237
01:19:04,182 --> 01:19:05,450
I'm so sorry, Sang Yeob.

2238
01:19:05,517 --> 01:19:07,285
- It's Sung Tae. - Right.

2239
01:19:07,285 --> 01:19:08,787
It's Sung Tae. Wait.

2240
01:19:08,787 --> 01:19:11,089
Wait. It's Sung Tae.

2241
01:19:11,089 --> 01:19:12,290
- Oh, gosh. - Hey.

2242
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:13,625
(The puzzle come together.)

2243
01:19:13,992 --> 01:19:15,594
- We have to catch Sung Tae. - It's Sung Tae.

2244
01:19:15,594 --> 01:19:17,829
- It's him. - He said he was the witness, right?

2245
01:19:17,963 --> 01:19:19,031
He's the culprit.

2246
01:19:19,031 --> 01:19:20,298
- Sung Tae. - Yes?

2247
01:19:20,866 --> 01:19:22,968
- Where are you going? - First floor.

2248
01:19:24,036 --> 01:19:25,771
You have to be careful, Sung Tae.

2249
01:19:25,771 --> 01:19:27,105
- You can't go around by yourself. - Okay?

2250
01:19:27,205 --> 01:19:29,474
- Don't go around by yourself. - Don't do that.

2251
01:19:30,042 --> 01:19:31,710
- We have to protect the witness. - Let's go.

2252
01:19:32,677 --> 01:19:33,712
We're his bodyguards.

2253
01:19:33,712 --> 01:19:35,747
He looks so naive.

2254
01:19:35,747 --> 01:19:38,650
You can't survive in this world like that, Sung Tae.

2255
01:19:39,351 --> 01:19:41,019
Sung Tae tricked us all.

2256
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:43,755
The witness won't say it's him.

2257
01:19:43,755 --> 01:19:44,990
- Exactly. - Right?

2258
01:19:45,223 --> 01:19:46,491
- I... - But...

2259
01:19:47,092 --> 01:19:48,794
But Se Chan got tricked.

2260
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,501
Hey, Sung Tae.

2261
01:19:56,768 --> 01:19:57,869
- Yes? - Did you find it?

2262
01:19:57,869 --> 01:19:58,970
No, not yet.

2263
01:19:59,371 --> 01:20:00,705
- Not yet? - Yes.

2264
01:20:00,705 --> 01:20:02,374
(You can't because you're not the witness.)

2265
01:20:02,374 --> 01:20:03,575
Have you seen Sang Yeob?

2266
01:20:04,576 --> 01:20:07,245
(I have a bad feeling.)

2267
01:20:09,147 --> 01:20:12,751
(Sung Tae feels threatened and runs away. Jae Seok chases him.)

2268
01:20:13,452 --> 01:20:14,486
Catch him!

2269
01:20:14,486 --> 01:20:15,754
- What's going on? - What?

2270
01:20:15,954 --> 01:20:16,955
(Somebody is attacking our witness.)

2271
01:20:16,955 --> 01:20:18,924
- Help me! - What? Who is it?

2272
01:20:19,424 --> 01:20:20,625
Help me!

2273
01:20:20,926 --> 01:20:21,993
Help me!

2274
01:20:21,993 --> 01:20:24,196
- What is it? - Catch him.

2275
01:20:24,396 --> 01:20:26,131
- He's the villain. - I'm not!

2276
01:20:26,198 --> 01:20:27,999
- He is. He's the villain. - Wait.

2277
01:20:27,999 --> 01:20:29,301
He got it wrong.

2278
01:20:29,301 --> 01:20:30,402
- Is he the villain? - He is.

2279
01:20:30,402 --> 01:20:31,603
Sung Tae...

2280
01:20:31,603 --> 01:20:32,904
Then...

2281
01:20:33,004 --> 01:20:35,040
Then we'll see during trial.

2282
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,042
- Come here. - No, he's the witness.

2283
01:20:37,042 --> 01:20:38,477
- He's the witness. - I'm not it!

2284
01:20:38,477 --> 01:20:40,045
- He's the witness. - He's not!

2285
01:20:40,045 --> 01:20:42,047
- He is. - He's the villain!

2286
01:20:42,047 --> 01:20:43,915
- He was lying. - Let go.

2287
01:20:43,915 --> 01:20:45,217
(If the witness gets eliminated, the villains win.)

2288
01:20:45,217 --> 01:20:46,918
- He's the villain. - He's not.

2289
01:20:46,918 --> 01:20:48,053
He is.

2290
01:20:48,053 --> 01:20:50,489
We'll see you during trial.

2291
01:20:50,489 --> 01:20:52,124
- This is driving me nuts. - Go.

2292
01:20:52,124 --> 01:20:53,558
- He's the witness. - This is driving me nuts.

2293
01:20:53,558 --> 01:20:55,193
We're going to protect our witness.

2294
01:20:55,193 --> 01:20:56,962
(Is Sung Tae the witness or the villain? Who's right?)

2295
01:20:57,229 --> 01:20:58,597
Five minutes before the race ends.

2296
01:20:58,597 --> 01:21:00,398
I think it is Sung Tae.

2297
01:21:00,866 --> 01:21:02,067
Have you met Sung Tae?

2298
01:21:02,067 --> 01:21:03,568
It was chaotic.

2299
01:21:03,568 --> 01:21:04,603
Who and who?

2300
01:21:04,603 --> 01:21:06,638
Sung Tae is here.

2301
01:21:07,005 --> 01:21:08,607
(Catch Sung Tae!)

2302
01:21:08,607 --> 01:21:09,674
Sung Tae.

2303
01:21:10,208 --> 01:21:11,309
Goodness.

2304
01:21:11,309 --> 01:21:12,477
Come here.

2305
01:21:13,478 --> 01:21:14,613
Come here first.

2306
01:21:14,613 --> 01:21:16,715
- Jae Seok... - Go in.

2307
01:21:16,982 --> 01:21:18,316
I have to find the box.

2308
01:21:18,316 --> 01:21:19,451
(I have to find the evidence.)

2309
01:21:19,584 --> 01:21:22,787
(Only the witness can open the evidence box.)

2310
01:21:22,787 --> 01:21:24,990
Sung Tae, I think it was in the dressing room.

2311
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:27,292
- What was? - The box.

2312
01:21:27,292 --> 01:21:28,460
(How do you know, Haha?)

2313
01:21:28,727 --> 01:21:31,163
I have to do something as the private investigator.

2314
01:21:31,163 --> 01:21:32,264
(Haha was anxiously searching for hints.)

2315
01:21:33,665 --> 01:21:36,468
(He found the evidence box...)

2316
01:21:36,468 --> 01:21:37,536
It's here.

2317
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:40,772
(in the dressing room.)

2318
01:21:42,307 --> 01:21:44,543
- It's the decisive evidence. - Let's go up.

2319
01:21:45,177 --> 01:21:46,945
Come out. Let's check together.

2320
01:21:47,078 --> 01:21:49,614
- Together. - It's this.

2321
01:21:49,614 --> 01:21:50,815
(Sung Tae and Detective Choi collect the evidence box.)

2322
01:21:50,815 --> 01:21:53,185
We don't have much time. We have two minutes.

2323
01:21:53,185 --> 01:21:54,186
(They have only 2 minutes until the final trial.)

2324
01:21:54,186 --> 01:21:56,087
The witness should open this.

2325
01:21:56,087 --> 01:22:00,258
(If you're the witness, please open this box.)

2326
01:22:00,258 --> 01:22:03,595
(Is Sung Tae really the witness?)

2327
01:22:04,596 --> 01:22:06,598
Are you the witness? You are.

2328
01:22:11,570 --> 01:22:14,873
You're the only witness who can find the decisive evidence...

2329
01:22:15,073 --> 01:22:18,210
about the villains and reveal it.

2330
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:20,011
(Sung Tae was the witness.)

2331
01:22:21,179 --> 01:22:22,314
This key...

2332
01:22:22,981 --> 01:22:24,783
can open the evidence box.

2333
01:22:24,783 --> 01:22:25,984
(It proves that he's the witness.)

2334
01:22:25,984 --> 01:22:29,454
(This key will reveal the truth.)

2335
01:22:31,089 --> 01:22:33,425
(He opens the box.)

2336
01:22:33,425 --> 01:22:35,460
I have a feeling.

2337
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:36,561
- Really? - Yes.

2338
01:22:36,995 --> 01:22:41,433
(The box finally opens.)

2339
01:22:41,933 --> 01:22:43,001
"One of the..."

2340
01:22:43,001 --> 01:22:44,302
(What is the decisive hint...)

2341
01:22:44,302 --> 01:22:46,938
(inside the box?)

2342
01:22:46,938 --> 01:22:49,140
The trial is starting soon.

2343
01:22:49,374 --> 01:22:51,276
Please gather in court.

2344
01:22:51,276 --> 01:22:52,477
I think...

2345
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:54,613
- In the end... - Did you find it, Sung Tae?

2346
01:22:54,646 --> 01:22:55,647
I did.

2347
01:22:55,647 --> 01:22:57,349
(He truly was the witness.)

2348
01:22:57,749 --> 01:23:01,086
- I'm sorry, Sung Tae. - Did you find it?

2349
01:23:01,086 --> 01:23:02,654
I'm sorry. I was mistaken.

2350
01:23:02,654 --> 01:23:05,023
- He's the witness. - He really is?

2351
01:23:05,023 --> 01:23:06,691
I was mistaken, Sung Tae.

2352
01:23:07,325 --> 01:23:09,060
I'm sorry.

2353
01:23:09,494 --> 01:23:12,030
I was mistaken. It wasn't Sang Yeob.

2354
01:23:12,030 --> 01:23:15,000
The final trial will begin.

2355
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,969
(The final trial begins.)

2356
01:23:18,937 --> 01:23:20,839
Witness, did you find the hint?

2357
01:23:21,139 --> 01:23:22,207
Yes.

2358
01:23:22,207 --> 01:23:25,076
(He will reveal what's inside the box.)

2359
01:23:27,512 --> 01:23:28,513
Good job.

2360
01:23:28,513 --> 01:23:32,017
(What's the truth inside this box?)

2361
01:23:32,751 --> 01:23:33,985
I think...

2362
01:23:34,452 --> 01:23:37,155
we had our stereotypes.

2363
01:23:37,155 --> 01:23:40,158
(I think we had our stereotypes.)

2364
01:23:41,326 --> 01:23:43,295
"One of the villains..."

2365
01:23:43,295 --> 01:23:49,701
(One of the villains...)

2366
01:23:49,701 --> 01:23:50,802
"is a detective."

2367
01:23:50,802 --> 01:23:54,105
(One of the villains is a detective.)

2368
01:23:54,973 --> 01:23:57,676
"One of the villains is a detective."

2369
01:23:57,676 --> 01:23:59,744
(One of the villains is a detective.)

2370
01:23:59,911 --> 01:24:05,550
(Either Gwi Hwa or Jae Seok is a villain.)

2371
01:24:06,551 --> 01:24:09,688
This person is like Lee Jung Jae in "New World".

2372
01:24:09,688 --> 01:24:11,289
(Everyone has a mental breakdown.)

2373
01:24:11,289 --> 01:24:12,557
Lee Jung Jae in "New World".

2374
01:24:12,557 --> 01:24:14,559
- May I speak? - I...

2375
01:24:14,559 --> 01:24:16,661
- May I speak? - Please go ahead.

2376
01:24:16,661 --> 01:24:19,731
Which detective tried to kill the witness?

2377
01:24:20,198 --> 01:24:21,700
Yu Jae Seok.

2378
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:24,736
(Yu Jae Seok.)

2379
01:24:26,037 --> 01:24:29,074
(5 minutes before)

2380
01:24:29,074 --> 01:24:34,713
(Detective Yu tried to eliminate Sung Tae, the witness.)

2381
01:24:36,081 --> 01:24:38,316
(Only the villain aims to silence the witness.)

2382
01:24:38,316 --> 01:24:41,186
(Is Detective Yu the villain?)

2383
01:24:41,853 --> 01:24:42,921
Everyone.

2384
01:24:43,521 --> 01:24:46,191
The villain is an actor. I am not an actor.

2385
01:24:46,191 --> 01:24:48,393
Excuse me. There is something I want to ask.

2386
01:24:48,393 --> 01:24:50,295
- Who saw that hint? - I did.

2387
01:24:50,295 --> 01:24:53,598
We only heard from Jae Seok that the villain is an actor.

2388
01:24:53,765 --> 01:24:55,300
- Has anyone else read the hint? - No one has read it.

2389
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:57,769
- No one has read it. - We believed his words.

2390
01:24:57,769 --> 01:25:00,171
- That's why we doubted the actors. - Who framed...

2391
01:25:00,171 --> 01:25:01,706
Kwang Soo and Sang Yeob in the beginning?

2392
01:25:02,207 --> 01:25:04,743
- You need to keep that in mind. - Isn't it strange that...

2393
01:25:04,743 --> 01:25:07,212
every piece of the puzzle is working...

2394
01:25:07,212 --> 01:25:09,414
- in Gwi Hwa's favor? - Then explain yourself.

2395
01:25:09,414 --> 01:25:11,182
I have been set up.

2396
01:25:11,182 --> 01:25:13,151
- I have been set up - No.

2397
01:25:13,485 --> 01:25:14,586
Everyone.

2398
01:25:14,953 --> 01:25:18,423
I almost made a big mistake today.

2399
01:25:18,556 --> 01:25:19,557
There is another thing.

2400
01:25:19,557 --> 01:25:22,127
- Gwi Hwa eliminated Jong Kook. - Yes.

2401
01:25:22,594 --> 01:25:23,895
I asked Gwi Hwa...

2402
01:25:24,095 --> 01:25:26,998
how he knew that Jong Kook was a villain.

2403
01:25:27,132 --> 01:25:30,468
He said that he trailed him on a hunch.

2404
01:25:33,004 --> 01:25:37,108
(While everyone else was focused on finding the hints,)

2405
01:25:37,108 --> 01:25:41,379
(Detective Choi arrested a villain right away.)

2406
01:25:41,379 --> 01:25:42,547
You arrested him.

2407
01:25:42,847 --> 01:25:45,583
(How did you know that Jong Kook was a villain?)

2408
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:47,452
(I had a hunch.)

2409
01:25:47,585 --> 01:25:49,487
I trailed Jong Kook.

2410
01:25:49,487 --> 01:25:53,291
(Did he catch Jong Kook on his hunch alone?)

2411
01:25:53,291 --> 01:25:54,626
What do you think it means?

2412
01:25:54,759 --> 01:25:58,229
It was in the scenario that was written...

2413
01:25:58,229 --> 01:25:59,497
- by the two villains. - That's right.

2414
01:25:59,497 --> 01:26:02,133
"If I eliminate you, people will believe me."

2415
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:04,002
"When everything ends,"

2416
01:26:04,002 --> 01:26:06,204
"let's split the money." Isn't that what happened?

2417
01:26:06,204 --> 01:26:08,606
Although I am a detective like him,

2418
01:26:08,606 --> 01:26:10,809
I felt chills down my spine toward the end.

2419
01:26:11,109 --> 01:26:12,644
I believed him.

2420
01:26:13,478 --> 01:26:15,046
When he began to chase after someone...

2421
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,582
We didn't know it was Jong Kook. When we heard that...

2422
01:26:17,582 --> 01:26:18,917
the villain's name had a J...

2423
01:26:18,917 --> 01:26:20,018
(Clearing his throat)

2424
01:26:21,085 --> 01:26:22,754
(The phlegm fairy appears.)

2425
01:26:22,754 --> 01:26:24,155
My goodness.

2426
01:26:24,956 --> 01:26:26,090
He is the phlegm fairy.

2427
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:27,459
Go to the restroom.

2428
01:26:28,059 --> 01:26:29,761
- Go to the restroom. - I am sorry.

2429
01:26:30,495 --> 01:26:32,564
If you are done, I would like to plead.

2430
01:26:32,564 --> 01:26:36,167
(Detective Choi counterattacks.)

2431
01:26:37,535 --> 01:26:41,072
Firstly, let's go over what happened the most recently.

2432
01:26:41,139 --> 01:26:42,707
The decisive hint.

2433
01:26:42,707 --> 01:26:43,908
(The box that contains the decisive hint)

2434
01:26:43,908 --> 01:26:45,643
If I were a villain...

2435
01:26:45,643 --> 01:26:47,946
The three of us opened the box and read the hint together.

2436
01:26:47,946 --> 01:26:51,850
(He read the hint with Sung Tae and Haha.)

2437
01:26:51,850 --> 01:26:55,553
I could have eliminated them before opening the box.

2438
01:26:55,553 --> 01:26:56,554
That's right.

2439
01:26:56,554 --> 01:26:59,591
Then I would have won the race.

2440
01:26:59,591 --> 01:27:00,792
I could have eliminated all the members...

2441
01:27:00,792 --> 01:27:01,926
by meeting them one by one.

2442
01:27:01,926 --> 01:27:03,194
- As the villain? - Right.

2443
01:27:03,194 --> 01:27:05,463
There is something I want to add.

2444
01:27:05,463 --> 01:27:06,498
(Additionally)

2445
01:27:06,498 --> 01:27:09,400
Who chased after you to eliminate you?

2446
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:10,635
(He stresses that Jae Seok tried to eliminate the witness.)

2447
01:27:11,002 --> 01:27:12,937
Have I ever chased after you to eliminate you?

2448
01:27:12,937 --> 01:27:14,305
- So... - I haven't.

2449
01:27:14,305 --> 01:27:16,107
(The two detectives' defenses end.)

2450
01:27:16,975 --> 01:27:21,980
We won't have an open vote. If you write a name and turn it in,

2451
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,449
we will give the chosen one the final judgment.

2452
01:27:24,449 --> 01:27:28,186
(The detective with more votes receives the final judgment.)

2453
01:27:28,186 --> 01:27:31,956
(No one knows how this game of truth will end.)

2454
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:34,526
(The 8 members finish voting.)

2455
01:27:35,793 --> 01:27:38,396
(Who has more votes?)

2456
01:27:39,597 --> 01:27:42,934
There is a total of eight votes.

2457
01:27:43,234 --> 01:27:44,936
The result is 5 to 3.

2458
01:27:44,936 --> 01:27:47,305
(The result is 5 to 3.)

2459
01:27:47,805 --> 01:27:49,607
It's 5 to 3.

2460
01:27:49,607 --> 01:27:52,176
The person who received five votes...

2461
01:27:52,176 --> 01:27:54,078
(Who is the chosen one for the final judgment?)

2462
01:27:54,078 --> 01:27:57,248
(Is it Detective Yu who aimed for the witness?)

2463
01:27:58,182 --> 01:28:01,953
(Is it Detective Choi who caught Jong Kook on a hunch?)

2464
01:28:03,221 --> 01:28:05,590
(Which detective is the chosen one...)

2465
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:07,992
(for the final judgment...)

2466
01:28:07,992 --> 01:28:09,827
(with five votes?)

2467
01:28:09,827 --> 01:28:11,563
Yu Jae Seok, please come to the stand.

2468
01:28:11,963 --> 01:28:14,232
- All right! - You fools!

2469
01:28:14,432 --> 01:28:16,534
(Yu Jae Seok, please come to the stand.)

2470
01:28:16,601 --> 01:28:19,070
- You fools! - Please come to the stand.

2471
01:28:19,304 --> 01:28:20,939
- Justice wins. - You are fools.

2472
01:28:20,939 --> 01:28:22,206
- Seriously. - It's Gwi Hwa!

2473
01:28:22,206 --> 01:28:23,841
I should have eliminated him.

2474
01:28:23,841 --> 01:28:24,976
(I am so upset.)

2475
01:28:26,844 --> 01:28:28,079
(It's the final judgment.)

2476
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:30,481
If Yu Jae Seok is the villain, the civilians and witness...

2477
01:28:30,481 --> 01:28:31,783
will win.

2478
01:28:31,950 --> 01:28:35,086
If he isn't the villain,

2479
01:28:35,086 --> 01:28:36,688
the villains win.

2480
01:28:36,688 --> 01:28:37,889
His identity will be revealed.

2481
01:28:38,990 --> 01:28:39,991
One.

2482
01:28:39,991 --> 01:28:42,026
(The witness checks his identity.)

2483
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:43,761
Two.

2484
01:28:43,761 --> 01:28:44,929
(What is...)

2485
01:28:44,929 --> 01:28:45,964
Three.

2486
01:28:45,964 --> 01:28:47,665
(Detective Yu's...)

2487
01:28:47,665 --> 01:28:50,935
(identity?)

2488
01:28:52,103 --> 01:28:53,371
(Ripping)

2489
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:56,341
I told you!

2490
01:28:56,341 --> 01:29:02,780
(Yu Jae Seok was a detective.)

2491
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:04,182
(The civilians, witness, and detectives lose.)

2492
01:29:04,182 --> 01:29:05,450
I told you!

2493
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:09,187
(The villains win.)

2494
01:29:09,187 --> 01:29:10,254
For goodness' sake.

2495
01:29:10,688 --> 01:29:12,090
I told you.

2496
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:14,359
- You fools! - I told you.

2497
01:29:14,859 --> 01:29:16,060
I knew something was off.

2498
01:29:20,231 --> 01:29:24,469
You are a villain who stole the prize money of 3,000 dollars.

2499
01:29:24,502 --> 01:29:28,306
However, there is another villain who will help you.

2500
01:29:28,306 --> 01:29:29,841
(Here is your partner.)

2501
01:29:30,942 --> 01:29:32,010
My goodness.

2502
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:34,045
- Hello. - Hello.

2503
01:29:34,045 --> 01:29:35,113
Choi Gwi Hwa...

2504
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:38,249
is also one of the detectives.

2505
01:29:38,683 --> 01:29:41,519
What do you mean? I am a villain and a detective?

2506
01:29:41,786 --> 01:29:43,655
- That's right. - You know,

2507
01:29:44,222 --> 01:29:46,457
he looks like both a villain and a detective.

2508
01:29:47,325 --> 01:29:49,360
(That's how the two villains joined forces.)

2509
01:29:50,094 --> 01:29:51,095
Salute!

2510
01:29:51,095 --> 01:29:54,465
(As soon as the final race started...)

2511
01:29:54,465 --> 01:29:56,701
(and they were left alone...)

2512
01:29:56,701 --> 01:29:59,671
Listen to me. There is something you must keep in mind.

2513
01:29:59,671 --> 01:30:01,506
A lot of the hints point to me.

2514
01:30:01,506 --> 01:30:04,876
If I am in danger of getting eliminated,

2515
01:30:04,876 --> 01:30:07,612
you must rip off my name tag.

2516
01:30:07,912 --> 01:30:09,013
You must rip off my name tag.

2517
01:30:09,013 --> 01:30:10,081
(They agree to make Gwi Hwa gain trust.)

2518
01:30:11,382 --> 01:30:13,284
(Later on)

2519
01:30:13,284 --> 01:30:14,352
All right.

2520
01:30:15,086 --> 01:30:16,087
I am not a witness.

2521
01:30:16,087 --> 01:30:17,121
(He pretended to hunt Kwang Soo.)

2522
01:30:17,121 --> 01:30:18,222
What is going on?

2523
01:30:18,956 --> 01:30:20,291
Gwi Hwa! Gwi Hwa!

2524
01:30:20,291 --> 01:30:23,394
Hold onto him.

2525
01:30:23,394 --> 01:30:25,363
- Rip it! - Hold onto him.

2526
01:30:25,496 --> 01:30:27,432
- I got him. - He almost got me!

2527
01:30:27,598 --> 01:30:29,500
- I got him. - He almost got me!

2528
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:30,902
He almost got me!

2529
01:30:30,902 --> 01:30:32,336
My goodness.

2530
01:30:32,603 --> 01:30:34,405
- Come here for a second. - Are you alone?

2531
01:30:34,405 --> 01:30:35,707
- Have you met Jae Seok? - What?

2532
01:30:35,707 --> 01:30:37,008
- Have you met Jae Seok? - No.

2533
01:30:37,608 --> 01:30:39,177
- Why do you ask? - It's nothing.

2534
01:30:39,177 --> 01:30:45,049
(Then Gwi Hwa could hunt without anyone suspecting him.)

2535
01:30:45,249 --> 01:30:46,317
No way...

2536
01:30:46,851 --> 01:30:47,919
I am sorry.

2537
01:30:48,252 --> 01:30:49,587
(A wonderful collaboration between the phlegm fairy and ace member)

2538
01:30:49,587 --> 01:30:50,588
I am sorry.

2539
01:30:50,588 --> 01:30:52,724
(A wonderful collaboration between the phlegm fairy and ace member)

2540
01:30:53,791 --> 01:30:56,994
Thus, the prize money of 3,000 dollars...

2541
01:30:56,994 --> 01:30:59,397
go to the villains.

2542
01:30:59,397 --> 01:31:00,598
(The villains receive the prize money of 3,000 dollars.)

2543
01:31:00,598 --> 01:31:03,334
(It's the age of the villains.)

2544
01:31:03,334 --> 01:31:05,369
I struggled a lot.

2545
01:31:05,403 --> 01:31:07,205
I worried a lot.

2546
01:31:07,205 --> 01:31:08,272
(Sad)

2547
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:10,742
Gwi Hwa, take this.

2548
01:31:11,642 --> 01:31:15,179
(Gwi Hwa receives the donation card of 3,000 dollars.)

2549
01:31:15,179 --> 01:31:16,581
Donate the money.

2550
01:31:16,914 --> 01:31:18,816
The money goes to donation under your name.

2551
01:31:18,816 --> 01:31:20,017
(They donate under the villains' names.)

2552
01:31:24,021 --> 01:31:25,356
This is the twist.

2553
01:31:25,690 --> 01:31:27,892
- His face turned dark. - The money goes to donation.

2554
01:31:27,892 --> 01:31:29,961
Congratulations, Gwi Hwa.

2555
01:31:30,061 --> 01:31:31,996
The four guests,

2556
01:31:32,096 --> 01:31:35,299
Sang Yeob, Sung Tae, Gwi Hwa,

2557
01:31:35,299 --> 01:31:37,602
and Bo Gyeol deserve a round of applause.

2558
01:31:37,602 --> 01:31:38,669
Thank you.
