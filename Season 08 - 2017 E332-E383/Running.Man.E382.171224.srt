1
00:00:06,783 --> 00:00:11,087
(A winter night before Christmas)

2
00:00:12,188 --> 00:00:16,860
(The members of Running Man arrive at a mysterious place on a van.)

3
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:19,696
(However, )

4
00:00:19,696 --> 00:00:22,699
(why are they wearing blindfolds?)

5
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:24,367
Why are we wearing blindfolds?

6
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:26,236
Why are we wearing them? Where could we be going?

7
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:27,904
I'm curious too. Did they prepare something for us?

8
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,173
When they blindfold us, they usually take us to prison or something.

9
00:00:30,173 --> 00:00:33,009
- Prison? - We're not headed to a good place.

10
00:00:33,743 --> 00:00:35,545
They don't usually blindfold us from the start.

11
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:37,080
It must be a surprise.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,015
- Where are we going? - Is it like the last supper?

13
00:00:39,015 --> 00:00:44,187
(At that time, the bus stops in the middle of the darkness.)

14
00:00:44,187 --> 00:00:45,989
- Will we gather and play games? - I guess we have arrived.

15
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:47,457
- You'll get off one by one. - Are all of us getting off?

16
00:00:47,457 --> 00:00:48,892
- Why are we exiting one by one? - But we can't see.

17
00:00:48,892 --> 00:00:49,959
I hope it's something good.

18
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:51,761
(The members are being isolated.)

19
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:52,762
Thank you.

20
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:54,698
I can't see at all.

21
00:00:55,432 --> 00:00:56,700
My gosh, it's freezing.

22
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:58,635
- Seriously. I can't see anything. - Watch out.

23
00:00:58,902 --> 00:00:59,903
There's a tree.

24
00:01:01,371 --> 00:01:03,473
Isn't this a Christmas Special? Wait. What is it?

25
00:01:03,473 --> 00:01:05,775
What just happened to my voice? I think we're inside a building.

26
00:01:06,843 --> 00:01:07,844
Do we go up?

27
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:09,212
We keep going up.

28
00:01:09,212 --> 00:01:10,213
(They enter a school.)

29
00:01:10,547 --> 00:01:12,182
I feel dizzy because I keep going up.

30
00:01:12,182 --> 00:01:14,851
(With their eyes covered, the members go up one by one.)

31
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:15,952
- Do I walk forward? - Yes.

32
00:01:17,153 --> 00:01:18,555
I am scared.

33
00:01:20,256 --> 00:01:21,725
Se Chan, will you throw up again?

34
00:01:21,725 --> 00:01:22,826
(He remembers what happened at Nevis Swing.)

35
00:01:23,493 --> 00:01:24,561
What is this?

36
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:27,364
(They enter a narrow place.)

37
00:01:27,364 --> 00:01:28,565
We're going into a small space.

38
00:01:28,565 --> 00:01:29,733
(They enter a narrow place at the end of the staircase.)

39
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:31,267
Where are we?

40
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:33,169
What is this?

41
00:01:33,737 --> 00:01:34,904
Is this an attic?

42
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:36,740
Where are we going?

43
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:38,174
(They enter an attic-like place.)

44
00:01:38,174 --> 00:01:39,342
- Is that you, Haha? - Yes, it's me.

45
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:41,711
Come here carefully.

46
00:01:42,512 --> 00:01:43,613
Where are you, So Min?

47
00:01:43,613 --> 00:01:44,748
Everyone,

48
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:48,118
please remove your blindfold at the count of three.

49
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:49,853
(Please remove your blindfold at the count of three.)

50
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:52,055
Perhaps you will make us shed tears.

51
00:01:52,055 --> 00:01:53,857
- Is this a guerrilla concert? - Okay, everyone...

52
00:01:53,857 --> 00:01:55,024
(Is this a guerrilla concert to celebrate Christmas?)

53
00:01:55,024 --> 00:01:58,228
(If not...)

54
00:01:58,228 --> 00:01:59,329
Please remove your blindfold.

55
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:01,464
(Is this a Christmas nightmare?)

56
00:02:01,464 --> 00:02:02,565
Do we take it off?

57
00:02:02,565 --> 00:02:07,971
(What awaits them?)

58
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,510
(It's a Christmas feast.)

59
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,844
I was right.

60
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:16,613
(It's for the members who worked hard for a year.)

61
00:02:16,613 --> 00:02:18,248
- Look at this. - What is this?

62
00:02:18,248 --> 00:02:19,949
- I said it might be a feast. - What is this?

63
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,485
This is incredible.

64
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:25,288
(There are presents under the twinkling tree.)

65
00:02:25,822 --> 00:02:29,159
(Welcome to Running Man's Christmas Party.)

66
00:02:29,426 --> 00:02:30,760
- Are you serious? - I was right.

67
00:02:31,127 --> 00:02:33,263
- How did you know from the smell? - What is this?

68
00:02:33,263 --> 00:02:34,597
(What a surprise!)

69
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:37,300
- I am touched. - What has gotten into the crew?

70
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:39,335
Are you serious?

71
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:40,503
Can we eat this?

72
00:02:41,104 --> 00:02:43,706
To celebrate Christmas,

73
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:46,643
- we prepared a Christmas miracle. - Thank you for the food.

74
00:02:46,643 --> 00:02:48,077
- Thank you for the food. - Is it tasty?

75
00:02:48,778 --> 00:02:50,580
- I want to eat that one. - Who knew this day would come?

76
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,715
Everyone, merry Christmas.

77
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:53,983
(Everyone, merry Christmas.)

78
00:02:53,983 --> 00:02:55,285
Merry Christmas.

79
00:02:55,452 --> 00:02:57,454
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

80
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:59,189
Christmas is...

81
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:00,657
just another day in December.

82
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:02,859
(Christmas is a just the 25th of December.)

83
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:05,261
He is ruining the mood as soon as the party started.

84
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:08,198
- I should eat quickly and go. - I should eat quickly and go.

85
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:10,433
Gosh, what a killjoy!

86
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:13,736
This is why I didn't want to come to this party.

87
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:15,705
- For goodness' sake. - It's tasty.

88
00:03:15,705 --> 00:03:18,441
I love Chuseok and Christmas.

89
00:03:18,441 --> 00:03:20,343
Why do you like them?

90
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,679
I like the festive atmosphere.

91
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:24,180
(I like the festive atmosphere.)

92
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:29,152
(Christmas puts lights on the street and love on the face.)

93
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,521
I like the festive atmosphere.

94
00:03:31,521 --> 00:03:34,591
- You don't go out. You stay home. - You got me.

95
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:35,892
(You know that I am a homebody.)

96
00:03:35,892 --> 00:03:37,260
You stay home.

97
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,063
- Still, they play movies. - Special movies for the holiday.

98
00:03:40,063 --> 00:03:41,664
We get to see Macaulay Culkin.

99
00:03:41,731 --> 00:03:43,099
- "Home Alone". - "Home Alone".

100
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,300
He is a mischief-maker.

101
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:47,270
Macaulay Culkin is...

102
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:48,705
an alcoholic now.

103
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,342
- He must be Kwang Soo's age. - That's right.

104
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:54,744
This feels strange.

105
00:03:54,744 --> 00:03:55,745
What's wrong?

106
00:03:55,745 --> 00:03:57,614
(He suddenly coughs.)

107
00:03:57,614 --> 00:03:58,748
What's the matter?

108
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:00,316
- What's wrong? - He has a cold.

109
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:01,584
You know,

110
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:03,586
Jong Kook takes care of his body the most.

111
00:04:03,653 --> 00:04:05,221
He is the sickest in winter.

112
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:07,490
(He is the preacher of health.)

113
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,526
- His body is like glass. - Why does he even work out?

114
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:12,028
I know that it's winter when Jong Kook catches a cold.

115
00:04:12,095 --> 00:04:13,530
He doesn't turn on the air conditioner in the summer...

116
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,931
in order to avoid getting sick.

117
00:04:16,432 --> 00:04:17,800
What are those presents? Do we get those presents?

118
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,935
When do we get them?

119
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:21,037
I want one. I want a drone.

120
00:04:21,037 --> 00:04:22,405
I want a video game console.

121
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:24,574
If I win a drone,

122
00:04:24,574 --> 00:04:26,042
I will always fly it above me.

123
00:04:26,743 --> 00:04:28,711
You should take the head deodorizer.

124
00:04:28,711 --> 00:04:32,415
(You don't need a drone.)

125
00:04:32,882 --> 00:04:34,817
(It's a present that targets Seok Jin and So Min, )

126
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,653
(who suffer due to their smelly heads.)

127
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:38,221
I was so surprised.

128
00:04:38,221 --> 00:04:39,322
It's what I smelled, right?

129
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:40,957
- I was so surprised. - It's what I smelled, right?

130
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:45,228
(Perfume spray that eliminates the head odor is ready.)

131
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:47,897
- Seriously. - It's for Seok Jin.

132
00:04:47,897 --> 00:04:49,899
- Seok Jin's head... - It smells like flesh.

133
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:51,601
His head smells rotten.

134
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:55,004
- You are done eating, right? - Yes.

135
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:56,673
This is tasty.

136
00:04:56,673 --> 00:04:57,740
(The merry feast ends.)

137
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,808
What?

138
00:04:58,808 --> 00:04:59,876
The chefs are dressed up as Santas.

139
00:04:59,876 --> 00:05:01,277
Merry Christmas.

140
00:05:01,277 --> 00:05:03,346
(Merry Christmas!)

141
00:05:03,813 --> 00:05:05,882
- These are presents. - What is this?

142
00:05:05,882 --> 00:05:07,717
We brought objects with Christmas-related memories.

143
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:08,818
(What are the presents?)

144
00:05:08,818 --> 00:05:10,353
- Memories. - They asked us to bring them.

145
00:05:11,788 --> 00:05:13,156
(The objects with Christmas-related memories)

146
00:05:13,156 --> 00:05:15,425
- We... - What is this?

147
00:05:15,425 --> 00:05:16,593
These objects are related to Christmas.

148
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:19,696
(What is this object?)

149
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:20,997
Kwang Soo,

150
00:05:20,997 --> 00:05:22,632
- for goodness' sake. - Kwang Soo.

151
00:05:22,632 --> 00:05:24,167
For goodness' sake.

152
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,935
- You... - Why?

153
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,873
(The silhouette is similar to Dan Bi, )

154
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:34,978
(Kwang Soo's object of memory and soulmate.)

155
00:05:35,144 --> 00:05:37,313
He always brings stuffed animals!

156
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:39,282
- You brought a giraffe again. - It's not a giraffe.

157
00:05:39,282 --> 00:05:40,617
It has to be a giraffe.

158
00:05:40,617 --> 00:05:41,985
- It has to be a giraffe. - It's not a giraffe.

159
00:05:41,985 --> 00:05:43,953
There is no way it's anything else.

160
00:05:43,953 --> 00:05:45,822
- It really isn't a giraffe. - It will be revealed soon.

161
00:05:45,822 --> 00:05:47,156
- For goodness' sake. - I think...

162
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:49,759
To celebrate Christmas,

163
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,762
we prepared a Christmas miracle.

164
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:54,864
A Christmas miracle sounds cool.

165
00:05:55,198 --> 00:05:57,567
Each member brought...

166
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:00,536
an object that contains Christmas-related memories.

167
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:01,537
- Yes. - Yes.

168
00:06:01,537 --> 00:06:03,673
When one member reveals the memory,

169
00:06:03,673 --> 00:06:08,077
other members will judge it by excellent, fair, and poor signs.

170
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:09,979
It will decide the present.

171
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:12,015
The members' judgment...

172
00:06:12,015 --> 00:06:14,384
will activate a Christmas miracle...

173
00:06:14,384 --> 00:06:16,753
and transform your memory into a present.

174
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:19,389
I need a coffee machine.

175
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:21,090
If we rate each other well,

176
00:06:21,124 --> 00:06:22,558
we can take the good presents.

177
00:06:22,558 --> 00:06:24,427
- Let's rate each other well. - In that case,

178
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:26,496
- I want a pillow. - Okay.

179
00:06:26,663 --> 00:06:27,964
I want a video game console.

180
00:06:27,964 --> 00:06:30,099
- I want an electric scooter. - I want a tablet computer.

181
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:31,868
Remember that it's Christmas.

182
00:06:32,702 --> 00:06:34,037
I want an electric scooter.

183
00:06:34,037 --> 00:06:35,605
An eye massager sounds nice.

184
00:06:35,905 --> 00:06:37,807
- So Min, do you want to go first? - Shall we do that?

185
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:39,509
It was hard.

186
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:43,513
Since you told me to bring a Christmas-related memory,

187
00:06:44,147 --> 00:06:46,549
I went over my old letters.

188
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:47,984
Letters are interesting.

189
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:50,253
- So Min has a lot of those. - She has a lot of those.

190
00:06:50,253 --> 00:06:51,688
I am jealous of her.

191
00:06:51,688 --> 00:06:53,356
I am the type of person who throws away old letters.

192
00:06:53,356 --> 00:06:56,592
This is a Christmas card I received...

193
00:06:56,592 --> 00:06:59,729
from a friend who goes back 20 years.

194
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:02,198
This is a pop-up card I made.

195
00:07:02,198 --> 00:07:03,232
Watch carefully.

196
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:04,967
- Ta-da. - How did you make that?

197
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,135
Did you make that?

198
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:09,605
(It's a Christmas card So Min made when she was young.)

199
00:07:09,605 --> 00:07:11,274
- Did you make that? - Yes.

200
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:13,509
I made it in fifth grade.

201
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:15,678
- I can't believe she still has it. - It's fascinating.

202
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:16,979
It dates back 20 years.

203
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,816
- You kept a card from a friend. - Yes.

204
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,017
May I read it?

205
00:07:21,017 --> 00:07:23,319
She did my homework a lot in middle school.

206
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,221
She must have put a lot of effort into this card.

207
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:27,256
- It's handmade. - Yes.

208
00:07:27,857 --> 00:07:28,958
Let's read it.

209
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,294
"To So Min. Hello, So Min. I am Na Rae."

210
00:07:31,294 --> 00:07:33,396
"Winter break and Christmas are fast approaching."

211
00:07:33,396 --> 00:07:35,431
"Have a fruitful winter break and a merry Christmas."

212
00:07:35,431 --> 00:07:37,967
"Receive a lot of presents from Santa."

213
00:07:38,768 --> 00:07:39,869
- What is this? - E 10,000.

214
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:41,871
It was popular to write "Stop" this way.

215
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:43,539
- E 10,000. - It sounds like "Stop".

216
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:44,907
(I will stop here.)

217
00:07:44,907 --> 00:07:45,975
It was popular back then.

218
00:07:46,342 --> 00:07:48,311
If you make an error, you crossed it out and write, "Under construction".

219
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:49,345
That's right. "Under construction".

220
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:50,580
- Really? - Yes.

221
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,948
- Did you do that? - Yes.

222
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:55,151
You cherish your memories.

223
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:57,019
This is a pop-up card I made.

224
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,788
When did you make it?

225
00:07:58,788 --> 00:08:01,557
I made it in 1997.

226
00:08:01,557 --> 00:08:02,859
It was right before the IMF Crisis.

227
00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:04,660
- 1997. - "Mom, it's my."

228
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,795
"It's me."

229
00:08:06,162 --> 00:08:08,898
You still made spelling mistakes at this age?

230
00:08:08,898 --> 00:08:10,199
"Mom, it's my."

231
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,336
"I am your trustworthy and lovely daughter."

232
00:08:13,336 --> 00:08:17,507
"Pat me on the head when you see this card, okay?"

233
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,075
"Merry Christmas."

234
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:21,410
So Min has a cute side.

235
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:23,479
The date is December 19th, 1997.

236
00:08:24,247 --> 00:08:25,448
December 19th.

237
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:26,716
It would be really scary...

238
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:28,417
if So Min made it yesterday.

239
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:30,920
(If that's the case...)

240
00:08:30,953 --> 00:08:32,555
- Kwang Soo. - Listen.

241
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:33,923
- It's a possibility. - Stop it.

242
00:08:33,923 --> 00:08:34,991
What would be scarier is this.

243
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,460
So Min still doesn't know how to spell.

244
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,529
- You're right. - That's really scary.

245
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:40,830
That would be scary.

246
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,298
It's a card with many twists.

247
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:44,600
(The truth is beyond them.)

248
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:46,302
It's time to judge it.

249
00:08:46,302 --> 00:08:47,537
Take a look at the pop-up card.

250
00:08:48,204 --> 00:08:50,506
(This deserves "Excellent".)

251
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:52,909
- I made up my mind. - Everyone grabbed "Excellent".

252
00:08:53,442 --> 00:08:54,610
It's time to give her a score.

253
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,579
(Thanks to the pop-up card, most of them reach for "Excellent".)

254
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,181
In 1, 2, 3.

255
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:03,953
(What's the value of So Min's Christmas memory?)

256
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,856
(Excellent)

257
00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:09,225
Merry Christmas!

258
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:11,160
(This is a miracle.)

259
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,161
This is amazing!

260
00:09:12,161 --> 00:09:13,462
We couldn't help it.

261
00:09:13,996 --> 00:09:15,965
So Min, if you choose a present from the Excellent pile,

262
00:09:15,965 --> 00:09:17,033
we will put a sticker on it.

263
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:18,801
Does she get a present right away?

264
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:19,836
Right away?

265
00:09:20,303 --> 00:09:21,838
I want a coffee machine.

266
00:09:21,838 --> 00:09:23,139
- Okay. - A coffee machine.

267
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:25,007
The coffee machine is mine.

268
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:27,410
The coffee machine is mine.

269
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:29,579
That's why he gave her "Fair".

270
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:32,815
(He really wants the coffee machine.)

271
00:09:32,815 --> 00:09:34,450
Seok Jin is scary.

272
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,886
He did it to take the coffee machine.

273
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:38,154
The coffee machine is mine.

274
00:09:38,154 --> 00:09:39,789
(I swear I will take it from her.)

275
00:09:40,056 --> 00:09:41,824
It warms my heart.

276
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,895
Let's take a look at what Seok Jin brought.

277
00:09:45,895 --> 00:09:47,430
To be honest,

278
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,665
I have been married for 18 years.

279
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:51,500
Since we moved nine times,

280
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:54,337
we don't have anything like this.

281
00:09:54,971 --> 00:09:56,105
I was really flustered...

282
00:09:56,105 --> 00:09:58,074
that I didn't have any objects of memories...

283
00:09:58,074 --> 00:10:00,042
such as cards or gifts.

284
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:01,811
- Things like this. - Seok Jin told me this...

285
00:10:02,211 --> 00:10:04,513
over the phone the day before yesterday.

286
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,583
"Which object should I bring?"

287
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,719
"I don't have anything either." "What will you do?"

288
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:11,020
"I will make something up."

289
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,156
(I have no other choice.)

290
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,525
- Stop lying. - It's not like that.

291
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:19,428
- It's not like that. - Why did you put on an act?

292
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:21,497
It's not like that.

293
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:23,933
Listen. After I told him that,

294
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,768
I thought for a while and remembered something.

295
00:10:26,202 --> 00:10:28,170
Since it's a secret...

296
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,641
my wife and I share, I wasn't sure if I should reveal it.

297
00:10:31,641 --> 00:10:32,875
He will reveal a family secret.

298
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,944
I wasn't sure if I should reveal it.

299
00:10:34,944 --> 00:10:36,545
However, I have no other choice. There is nothing else.

300
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:38,915
In relation to Christmas,

301
00:10:39,215 --> 00:10:41,584
my wife and I have a secret.

302
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:43,419
What is it?

303
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:44,553
- You will reveal it. - Yes.

304
00:10:44,754 --> 00:10:47,323
Yes. It's true.

305
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:51,327
(It's funny to him.)

306
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,296
- What is going on? - There he goes again.

307
00:10:53,462 --> 00:10:54,463
There he goes again.

308
00:10:54,463 --> 00:10:55,932
I will tell you.

309
00:10:56,065 --> 00:10:58,534
I am embarrassed...

310
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:00,503
to talk about this.

311
00:11:00,503 --> 00:11:02,071
What is it? He is acting strange.

312
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:03,439
People wash each other's feet...

313
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:05,207
- to wash away the past. - Yes.

314
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:08,110
We thought we'd go even further...

315
00:11:08,244 --> 00:11:10,947
and do this for each other.

316
00:11:10,947 --> 00:11:12,615
- Was it waxing? - No.

317
00:11:12,615 --> 00:11:13,616
(Was it waxing?)

318
00:11:13,616 --> 00:11:15,351
(No!)

319
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:17,119
- What was it then? - Hey.

320
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:19,555
What does a foot bath have to do with waxing?

321
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:20,790
Is this considered beautiful?

322
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,258
He seemed shy.

323
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:23,592
No, that wasn't it.

324
00:11:24,527 --> 00:11:25,861
We scrubbed each other's feet.

325
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:27,797
(He takes out a foot exfoliator.)

326
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:29,432
(They burst into a laughter.)

327
00:11:29,832 --> 00:11:31,734
(Seok Jin's Christmas memento is a foot exfoliator.)

328
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:32,802
Is that all you could think of?

329
00:11:32,802 --> 00:11:35,071
There's something here. I think it's dead skin.

330
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:36,339
- Here. - No, there are not.

331
00:11:36,372 --> 00:11:40,009
I couldn't bring the old one, so I brought a brand new one.

332
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:42,111
By the way, is it true?

333
00:11:42,111 --> 00:11:43,212
It's true.

334
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:45,681
Let's listen to his story. Tell us about it.

335
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:47,683
How can you not trust me?

336
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,552
It was Christmas, and we...

337
00:11:49,552 --> 00:11:51,320
I am sorry, but can we call her right now?

338
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,155
(He can't believe Seok Jin.)

339
00:11:53,155 --> 00:11:55,124
She's unwell right now.

340
00:11:55,725 --> 00:11:57,660
Come on, Seok Jin.

341
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,829
- Don't go that far. - Come on.

342
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:02,965
Her body temperature was 38°C, so I told her to go see a doctor.

343
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:05,434
- 38°C? - Yes. It went up that high.

344
00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:08,671
Actually, when you wash a foot...

345
00:12:08,871 --> 00:12:10,606
Once I got really emotional.

346
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:13,009
Her feet used to be really pretty.

347
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:14,677
I was washing her feet.

348
00:12:14,844 --> 00:12:16,312
And her skin was rough.

349
00:12:16,312 --> 00:12:17,546
(He realized that her skin had become rough.)

350
00:12:17,546 --> 00:12:20,149
I wondered what happened. Did she have a corn?

351
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:21,450
It turned out...

352
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:24,687
(He becomes emotional.)

353
00:12:24,687 --> 00:12:25,855
What is it?

354
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,524
Why does he take the glasses off when there are no glasses on them?

355
00:12:28,691 --> 00:12:30,226
It turned out she...

356
00:12:30,226 --> 00:12:31,527
He was faking it.

357
00:12:31,527 --> 00:12:32,661
(He's embarrassed.)

358
00:12:32,661 --> 00:12:37,333
It turned out she's been going to markets barefoot.

359
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,301
(What?)

360
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:42,104
- You're a liar. - Barefoot?

361
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:43,606
Your wife did that?

362
00:12:43,672 --> 00:12:45,775
- Is she like Lee Eun Mi? - Wait.

363
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:47,043
Is she the Barefoot Diva too?

364
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:50,179
She has calluses because she does Latin dance.

365
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:51,781
(Jae Seok knows the real reason.)

366
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:53,349
It's because she doesn't wear socks.

367
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:55,051
She does Latin dance.

368
00:12:55,051 --> 00:12:56,886
- Of course she likes samba. - I know.

369
00:12:56,886 --> 00:12:58,854
Her skin was so rough.

370
00:12:58,954 --> 00:13:00,790
Looking at it, I cried...

371
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,124
(Her rough skin made him very emotional.)

372
00:13:02,124 --> 00:13:03,192
my heart out.

373
00:13:03,225 --> 00:13:05,494
Did she really go to markets barefoot?

374
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,163
- Wait. - It doesn't make sense.

375
00:13:07,163 --> 00:13:09,532
- That's scary, you know? - That's horrifying.

376
00:13:09,532 --> 00:13:10,766
Take her to a doctor.

377
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:15,704
(The thought of his wife going shopping barefoot is scary.)

378
00:13:15,738 --> 00:13:19,208
Perhaps she had her reasons for going shopping barefoot.

379
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,576
And there's another one.

380
00:13:20,576 --> 00:13:22,278
(He reveals the second memento.)

381
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:24,447
It's a letter.

382
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:26,449
It's a letter of apology.

383
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,217
That's...

384
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:30,686
- It's a letter of apology. - When did you write it?

385
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:32,822
I didn't write it. My child wrote it.

386
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:34,223
My child did.

387
00:13:34,223 --> 00:13:35,958
Did you bring whatever you could find?

388
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,193
Perhaps you just woke him up...

389
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:39,328
Perhaps you woke up him yesterday and made him write it.

390
00:13:39,328 --> 00:13:41,597
- Wait. - Is it related to Christmas?

391
00:13:41,597 --> 00:13:42,665
Of course it is.

392
00:13:42,665 --> 00:13:45,601
- He wrote it when he was little. - Can I see it?

393
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:47,703
- Can I see it? - I can't reveal the content.

394
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:50,005
(He can't reveal the content of the letter.)

395
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:52,408
- What? - What are you doing?

396
00:13:52,408 --> 00:13:54,510
- Let's see it. - Why did you bring it then?

397
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,345
- You should read it alone. - Wait.

398
00:13:56,512 --> 00:13:58,414
Don't read it out loud. Read it alone.

399
00:13:58,414 --> 00:14:01,283
It contains something personal.

400
00:14:01,283 --> 00:14:04,386
Right. But there's a carnation here.

401
00:14:04,653 --> 00:14:05,921
I think this was for Parents' Day.

402
00:14:05,921 --> 00:14:08,190
(It wasn't for Christmas.)

403
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:11,760
- Wait. - This was for Parents' Day.

404
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,895
No. Wait.

405
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:15,498
- Wait. - Give it to me.

406
00:14:15,498 --> 00:14:17,133
No. Wait.

407
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:18,367
- It's... - That's not it.

408
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,769
This must've been the only paper he had.

409
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,173
It is related to Christmas.

410
00:14:24,173 --> 00:14:26,609
- Can I read it then? - Yes.

411
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:27,843
"Mom and Dad."

412
00:14:28,144 --> 00:14:31,347
"Mom, I sometimes talk back to you, but I won't do that now."

413
00:14:31,347 --> 00:14:33,349
"I will be polite from now on."

414
00:14:33,482 --> 00:14:37,253
"And if I am born again, I want to be born as your son again."

415
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:38,821
- "I love you." - Right.

416
00:14:39,155 --> 00:14:41,123
This was written on May 2.

417
00:14:41,123 --> 00:14:43,492
(It's right before the Parents' Day.)

418
00:14:44,193 --> 00:14:45,694
- Hey. - It's written right here.

419
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:48,697
- Why does he lie so much? - Stop it.

420
00:14:49,665 --> 00:14:52,034
- It says "May 2" here. - I folded it.

421
00:14:52,168 --> 00:14:53,903
Why would you fold this part?

422
00:14:53,903 --> 00:14:55,237
Merry Christmas.

423
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:56,872
Wait.

424
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,743
My family looks at this on Christmas.

425
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,345
1, 2, 3.

426
00:15:03,345 --> 00:15:07,950
(Seok Jin gets "poor".)

427
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,852
Okay. I won't forget this.

428
00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:10,853
(I will get my revenge.)

429
00:15:10,853 --> 00:15:13,322
You won a portable cell phone power bank.

430
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:16,492
- Let's check Ji Hyo's. It's big. - You see,

431
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:20,663
Santa used to be very important to me.

432
00:15:20,663 --> 00:15:24,466
Until I was in Grade Four, I believed in Santa.

433
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:27,102
- It lasted long. - I brought a doll...

434
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:29,071
I really wanted to get from Santa...

435
00:15:29,071 --> 00:15:30,072
- It's a plastic doll. - when I was little.

436
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:32,041
- I brought a plastic doll. - It's lovely.

437
00:15:32,174 --> 00:15:33,943
Didn't Santa give it to you?

438
00:15:34,076 --> 00:15:35,211
- I have it. - I love it.

439
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,846
I was waiting for Santa with so much excitement.

440
00:15:37,947 --> 00:15:40,482
I wanted this so badly.

441
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:41,517
(She really wanted this doll.)

442
00:15:42,551 --> 00:15:46,288
(Little Ji Hyo waited all night long for Santa.)

443
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:48,657
The next-door neighbor...

444
00:15:48,857 --> 00:15:49,892
Next-door neighbor?

445
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:52,761
I saw him leaving this outside my house.

446
00:15:53,128 --> 00:15:54,930
That really hurt me.

447
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:59,101
And at that moment I realized that there is no Santa.

448
00:15:59,101 --> 00:16:00,336
I brought this as a reminder of that memory.

449
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:01,637
This is my memento.

450
00:16:01,637 --> 00:16:03,973
- You remembered it. - You believed in Santa...

451
00:16:03,973 --> 00:16:06,342
- until Grade Four. - It's...

452
00:16:06,342 --> 00:16:08,244
the story about how she learned the truth.

453
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:09,845
- Santa... - It's not bad.

454
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:11,480
Until when did you believe in Santa?

455
00:16:11,547 --> 00:16:14,250
I learned the truth a little early.

456
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,051
- But I used it. - I did too.

457
00:16:16,118 --> 00:16:17,753
I prayed out loud.

458
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,256
- I prayed for what I want. - Right.

459
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:21,290
I said out loud what I want.

460
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,459
Actually,

461
00:16:23,826 --> 00:16:25,194
I used it until I entered middle school.

462
00:16:25,427 --> 00:16:26,528
What?

463
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:27,796
- Middle school? - It's because...

464
00:16:27,796 --> 00:16:29,064
Isn't that too much?

465
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:30,666
Isn't that too old?

466
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:34,403
He's the type of person who would go to a women's...

467
00:16:34,403 --> 00:16:37,840
bath house pretending he's innocent. Isn't he?

468
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,642
- No. No. - Until when did you do it?

469
00:16:39,642 --> 00:16:41,510
Until when did you go to public bath houses with your mom?

470
00:16:41,644 --> 00:16:43,579
I don't remember it clearly.

471
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:45,714
Perhaps he was a high school freshman.

472
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:47,516
What are you saying?

473
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,418
Come on.

474
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:51,587
- Don't be ridiculous. - High school freshman.

475
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,122
That's...

476
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:54,390
High school freshman.

477
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,692
My goodness.

478
00:16:56,692 --> 00:16:58,427
- He would've pretended to be naive. - "Hello."

479
00:16:58,427 --> 00:16:59,995
Right. Right.

480
00:16:59,995 --> 00:17:01,430
That's horrible.

481
00:17:01,864 --> 00:17:06,101
It's Ji Hyo's turn. 1, 2, 3.

482
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:08,170
"Fair". It's "Fair".

483
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,438
(Ji Hyo's Christmas memory gets "fair".)

484
00:17:09,438 --> 00:17:10,506
Thank you.

485
00:17:12,374 --> 00:17:14,743
I want the calf massager.

486
00:17:15,044 --> 00:17:16,812
Jong Kook is next.

487
00:17:16,812 --> 00:17:17,980
- It's Jong Kook's turn. - It's Jong Kook's turn.

488
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,750
Okay. My family doesn't care about Christmas.

489
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,420
- He goes to the gym. He does. - His family, you mean?

490
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,790
Every year, I work out on Christmas.

491
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,891
I spend it alone.

492
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:32,161
10 years ago, I took my mom to the US,

493
00:17:32,161 --> 00:17:35,664
- and we spent Christmas there. - I see.

494
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:39,902
I took her to Disneyland.

495
00:17:39,902 --> 00:17:41,403
- That must've been lovely. - Right?

496
00:17:41,403 --> 00:17:44,206
I saw this pretty thing at the entrance of Disneyland.

497
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:47,376
My mom wanted to buy it too.

498
00:17:47,476 --> 00:17:48,944
So we bought one.

499
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:51,146
- Is it an egg? - Yes, it is an egg.

500
00:17:51,146 --> 00:17:54,016
By the look of it,

501
00:17:54,016 --> 00:17:56,118
- it doesn't look that appealing. - It doesn't, does it?

502
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:59,254
You don't want to buy it now.

503
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:00,756
- It's cute. - We didn't want it at first.

504
00:18:01,557 --> 00:18:03,292
Look.

505
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:05,194
- It's creepy. - It's adorable.

506
00:18:06,028 --> 00:18:09,264
(There's a baby doll inside an egg.)

507
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:11,633
It's cute.

508
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,369
It's a baby.

509
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:15,270
How can a baby come out of an egg? Is he Hyeokgeose of Silla?

510
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:17,473
It's Hyeokgeose of Las Vegas.

511
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:20,476
Is it James Hyeokgeose?

512
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:22,945
(Jong Kook's Christmas memento is born from an egg.)

513
00:18:22,945 --> 00:18:25,547
There's a baby inside the egg.

514
00:18:25,914 --> 00:18:27,216
It's a little creepy.

515
00:18:27,616 --> 00:18:29,618
- It's... - It's scary.

516
00:18:29,618 --> 00:18:30,953
(It's strange.)

517
00:18:30,953 --> 00:18:34,089
Why would you shove him inside that small space?

518
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:36,925
Touch him. It's really nice.

519
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:39,661
- It's cute. - It's really cute.

520
00:18:39,962 --> 00:18:41,764
I feel like he's going to open his eyes.

521
00:18:41,764 --> 00:18:43,532
People on social media are trying to...

522
00:18:43,766 --> 00:18:47,002
get Ji Hyo and Jong Kook to date.

523
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:48,704
There was even an article that we're getting married.

524
00:18:48,704 --> 00:18:50,139
There was an article.

525
00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:51,907
- It's been a year. - It shocked us too.

526
00:18:51,907 --> 00:18:53,275
It shocked us too.

527
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:54,877
Are we getting married?

528
00:18:54,877 --> 00:19:00,416
(They're asking other people about their future.)

529
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,518
I bet my entire fortune that they're not dating.

530
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:05,954
(That's how certain he is.)

531
00:19:05,954 --> 00:19:07,890
Can you take his fortune and split up?

532
00:19:08,257 --> 00:19:09,591
That's a good idea.

533
00:19:09,591 --> 00:19:11,026
He doesn't have a lot of assets anyway.

534
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:13,595
When that happens, his wife will have to go shopping barefoot.

535
00:19:14,563 --> 00:19:15,664
She will...

536
00:19:15,731 --> 00:19:17,232
Right.

537
00:19:17,232 --> 00:19:19,034
- It will actually be true. - You're right.

538
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:20,436
- Yes. - Yes.

539
00:19:21,403 --> 00:19:23,839
(I will scrub your feet tonight, honey.)

540
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,042
- 1, 2, 3. - It's really nice.

541
00:19:27,276 --> 00:19:28,610
I love this.

542
00:19:28,677 --> 00:19:30,946
3 "excellent", 3 "fair", and 3 poor" makes it "fair".

543
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:32,080
Thank you.

544
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,049
Why is it "fair"?

545
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,051
- If Kwang Soo gave you... - He should've raised "excellent".

546
00:19:36,118 --> 00:19:37,152
It's a shame.

547
00:19:37,152 --> 00:19:39,221
It's all right. It's not like he's ever helped me...

548
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:40,489
with anything in my life.

549
00:19:40,856 --> 00:19:42,291
I didn't expect anything.

550
00:19:43,091 --> 00:19:44,493
Why didn't you...

551
00:19:44,493 --> 00:19:45,594
- give him "excellent"? - I don't care.

552
00:19:45,594 --> 00:19:48,297
So Min gave him "poor". Why blame me?

553
00:19:48,297 --> 00:19:50,899
He doesn't care about So Min.

554
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:52,501
- Did you give him "poor"? - Did you give me "poor"?

555
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:53,735
Why did you do that?

556
00:19:53,802 --> 00:19:55,704
I want to hear your explanation. Why did you give me "poor"?

557
00:19:56,638 --> 00:19:58,040
It didn't touch me.

558
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,009
(She didn't care about the baby doll.)

559
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:02,311
It didn't touch you?

560
00:20:02,311 --> 00:20:03,645
(He's upset.)

561
00:20:03,812 --> 00:20:06,181
I think she's a psychopath.

562
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:07,516
Come on.

563
00:20:07,516 --> 00:20:09,551
Everyone is different.

564
00:20:10,052 --> 00:20:12,154
- There are good gifts. - There are.

565
00:20:12,154 --> 00:20:13,856
- There's Korean beef set. - What should I get?

566
00:20:14,056 --> 00:20:15,791
- Korean beef set is good. - Korean beef set is good.

567
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,125
Korean beef set is amazing.

568
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:20,796
- Share it with your mom. - I will. I love it.

569
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,965
Next is Haha.

570
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:25,734
I thought hard about what to bring.

571
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:27,603
What Christmas memories do I have?

572
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:31,740
If I was a single man,

573
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,176
I would go to a club and have a good time.

574
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:35,611
Since I got married and got my own family,

575
00:20:35,811 --> 00:20:39,281
I realized that you are supposed to...

576
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:42,417
spend your Christmas with your family.

577
00:20:42,851 --> 00:20:43,919
Family is important.

578
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,153
- What is it? - This is...

579
00:20:46,388 --> 00:20:48,891
- You brought a lot of things. - He's got a lot of things.

580
00:20:48,891 --> 00:20:51,026
This is all pieces that Dream drew himself.

581
00:20:51,026 --> 00:20:52,227
Really?

582
00:20:52,227 --> 00:20:54,363
He drew all of these pictures.

583
00:20:54,363 --> 00:20:55,998
I was touched by it.

584
00:20:55,998 --> 00:20:58,166
My mom keeps...

585
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,436
all the things I made or received when I was young.

586
00:21:01,436 --> 00:21:03,305
I want to be like that too.

587
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:04,873
Last year,

588
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:07,042
he made...

589
00:21:07,042 --> 00:21:09,945
- Did Dream make it? - a Christmas tree.

590
00:21:09,945 --> 00:21:11,380
- It's cute. - Did Dream make it?

591
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,849
Yes, he just colored it.

592
00:21:13,849 --> 00:21:15,350
His name is written on it.

593
00:21:16,184 --> 00:21:17,486
As soon as I saw it...

594
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,521
(As soon as I saw it...)

595
00:21:19,521 --> 00:21:21,323
What's wrong?

596
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:24,293
(He's about to cry.)

597
00:21:26,028 --> 00:21:30,632
(His eldest son Dream is his valuable treasure.)

598
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,835
(He made a Christmas tree with his tiny hands.)

599
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:37,639
I was so happy to be with my family.

600
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:39,241
We made a Christmas tree together...

601
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:42,344
- and spent the day laughing. - That sounds nice.

602
00:21:42,377 --> 00:21:43,946
I thought of my family...

603
00:21:44,146 --> 00:21:46,148
and remembered our Christmas together.

604
00:21:46,148 --> 00:21:47,683
It was so much fun last year.

605
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:49,851
- This is... - What is it?

606
00:21:49,918 --> 00:21:51,386
My father...

607
00:21:52,154 --> 00:21:54,256
loves "Edelweiss" very much.

608
00:21:54,556 --> 00:21:56,158
- It's from "The Sound of Music". - Edelweiss.

609
00:21:56,158 --> 00:21:58,260
(His father's "Edelweiss".)

610
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,829
My father picked a real edelweiss.

611
00:22:00,829 --> 00:22:02,564
- Is it real? - Yes.

612
00:22:02,764 --> 00:22:04,900
- Is that it? - He picked it...

613
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,468
- Wait. - in 1973.

614
00:22:06,468 --> 00:22:08,136
He gave it to me in 2011.

615
00:22:08,136 --> 00:22:09,237
- It's very old. - I wanted...

616
00:22:09,237 --> 00:22:11,673
to have the one that he framed.

617
00:22:11,673 --> 00:22:13,241
- It's interesting. - He gave it to me...

618
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:14,610
as a Christmas present.

619
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:17,112
Is it from Liechtenstein?

620
00:22:17,112 --> 00:22:19,414
It was when he was in Germany.

621
00:22:19,448 --> 00:22:22,851
- "An edelweiss for my son". - Yes.

622
00:22:22,851 --> 00:22:24,720
- He made it again. - "2011".

623
00:22:25,454 --> 00:22:27,856
For the three generations...

624
00:22:28,156 --> 00:22:30,058
from my father, me to my son,

625
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,728
we put it next to the tree.

626
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:36,431
We put the tree that Dream made next to it.

627
00:22:36,632 --> 00:22:38,400
This is how we spend our Christmas.

628
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,534
(His family is ready for Christmas in 2017.)

629
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:43,772
(Starting with Haha's father...)

630
00:22:43,772 --> 00:22:48,043
(to Haha's son)

631
00:22:48,443 --> 00:22:53,448
(These are memorable treasures to Haha's family.)

632
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:55,150
- Do you have more? - There's one more.

633
00:22:55,684 --> 00:22:57,219
- Do you have more? - It's unforgettable.

634
00:22:57,285 --> 00:23:00,522
- What is it? - It's the best Christmas gift.

635
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,491
Running Man.

636
00:23:02,491 --> 00:23:05,360
(The best Running Man present)

637
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,729
- I give it the lowest score. - Gosh.

638
00:23:07,729 --> 00:23:09,364
(It deserves the lowest score.)

639
00:23:09,364 --> 00:23:10,932
- Come on. - I give the lowest score.

640
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:12,467
- Please. - I give the lowest score.

641
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:14,002
- Seriously. - I'm being sincere.

642
00:23:14,002 --> 00:23:15,637
- The others were good. - I'm being sincere.

643
00:23:15,637 --> 00:23:17,272
- You were doing well. - I'm being sincere.

644
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:19,207
I liked Dream's tree.

645
00:23:19,207 --> 00:23:21,743
Okay, give him your score in the count of three.

646
00:23:21,743 --> 00:23:22,844
- Three. - Thank you.

647
00:23:22,844 --> 00:23:23,845
"Excellent".

648
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:26,448
(Haha scores Excellent.)

649
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:27,749
- I'll give you "Excellent". - Thank you.

650
00:23:27,749 --> 00:23:29,851
- He deserves it. - Thank you.

651
00:23:29,851 --> 00:23:31,053
(Haha wins a game player.)

652
00:23:31,753 --> 00:23:33,488
Next up is Se Chan.

653
00:23:33,488 --> 00:23:34,656
- Here's mine. - Let's listen.

654
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:37,826
Last Christmas Eve on December 24,

655
00:23:37,893 --> 00:23:41,263
I was on my way to a club with my friends.

656
00:23:41,563 --> 00:23:45,000
I coughed quite loudly.

657
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,268
When I coughed loudly,

658
00:23:46,268 --> 00:23:48,503
my lower back got cramped.

659
00:23:48,503 --> 00:23:50,005
- That could happen. - Yes.

660
00:23:50,005 --> 00:23:52,574
- That's possible. - I hurt my lower back.

661
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:55,077
On Christmas Eve last year,

662
00:23:55,577 --> 00:23:58,680
they gave me this to protect my back.

663
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:00,582
It's unforgettable.

664
00:24:00,582 --> 00:24:02,584
Everyone who had lower back surgery has it.

665
00:24:02,584 --> 00:24:05,287
Listen. I talked with Se Chan...

666
00:24:05,287 --> 00:24:06,621
on the phone.

667
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:10,258
I remember that we talked like Jae Seok and Seok Jin.

668
00:24:10,258 --> 00:24:11,326
- How? - What did we say?

669
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:12,394
"What will you bring, Se Chan?"

670
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:13,862
"I can't find anything."

671
00:24:14,296 --> 00:24:15,530
"I have to make something up."

672
00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:20,435
- Is this it? - I couldn't find anything to bring.

673
00:24:20,902 --> 00:24:23,238
No matter how much I searched, I found nothing.

674
00:24:23,238 --> 00:24:24,906
In 1, 2, 3.

675
00:24:24,906 --> 00:24:27,008
- This is a little... - I'm sorry.

676
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,844
- It's thoughtless. - Unfortunately, this is poor.

677
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:30,846
(Se Chan scores Poor.)

678
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:33,014
- Yes. - It wasn't impressive.

679
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:34,916
I'll take the head odor remover.

680
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:36,384
(He chooses a head odor remover.)

681
00:24:36,752 --> 00:24:39,554
Next up is Kwang Soo. If he brought the giraffe,

682
00:24:39,788 --> 00:24:41,389
- He will immediately get a "Poor". - Let's ignore him.

683
00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:42,958
If it's the giraffe, let's pass him.

684
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:48,530
(Did he bring Dan Bi again as his item?)

685
00:24:48,897 --> 00:24:50,499
For me,

686
00:24:50,499 --> 00:24:52,701
I don't remember...

687
00:24:53,502 --> 00:24:56,838
being happy and joyous on Christmas.

688
00:24:56,838 --> 00:24:57,839
I was always lonely.

689
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,574
(He always felt lonely.)

690
00:24:59,574 --> 00:25:00,609
Whenever I felt lonely...

691
00:25:01,743 --> 00:25:03,411
What are these legs?

692
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:05,013
- What are they? - Look at these.

693
00:25:05,013 --> 00:25:06,114
- Take a look. - I knew it.

694
00:25:06,114 --> 00:25:07,549
- Take a look first. - It's obvious.

695
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:09,384
- Take a look first. - I knew it.

696
00:25:09,584 --> 00:25:11,686
- That's Dan Bi again. - No.

697
00:25:11,686 --> 00:25:14,156
This is what stayed by my side.

698
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:15,557
Dan Bi?

699
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:16,558
It's Rudolph Dol Bi.

700
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,059
(It's Rudolph Dol Bi.)

701
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,162
- What? - It's Dol Bi.

702
00:25:20,462 --> 00:25:23,365
(It's Dol Bi instead of Dan Bi.)

703
00:25:23,365 --> 00:25:24,366
It's Dol Bi.

704
00:25:24,366 --> 00:25:25,467
Is he Rudolph?

705
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:27,335
- This is Rudolph? - Yes.

706
00:25:27,335 --> 00:25:28,370
It fell off.

707
00:25:28,837 --> 00:25:30,005
That's Rudolph?

708
00:25:30,005 --> 00:25:31,039
Are you kidding?

709
00:25:31,139 --> 00:25:32,774
- Are you kidding? - Do you think we're dumb?

710
00:25:32,774 --> 00:25:34,743
- Are you kidding, Kwang Soo? - It's Rudolph.

711
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:37,712
Dol Bi and Dan Bi look similar.

712
00:25:37,946 --> 00:25:39,881
They're different.

713
00:25:40,015 --> 00:25:42,017
Are you saying that this isn't the same giraffe?

714
00:25:42,017 --> 00:25:43,118
Right. It's Dol Bi.

715
00:25:43,118 --> 00:25:44,553
Is Dan Bi at home?

716
00:25:44,686 --> 00:25:45,687
Yes.

717
00:25:45,687 --> 00:25:47,656
(He tries to play it off.)

718
00:25:47,656 --> 00:25:48,723
Isn't it Dan Bi?

719
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,791
No.

720
00:25:51,893 --> 00:25:54,162
- Take it off. - Hey!

721
00:25:54,563 --> 00:25:55,931
Don't do that to Dol Bi's nose.

722
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:57,199
Isn't this fake?

723
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:58,867
What are you doing?

724
00:25:59,034 --> 00:26:00,569
- It's Dan Bi. - Long time no see.

725
00:26:00,569 --> 00:26:02,904
- It's Dan Bi. - It's definitely Dan Bi.

726
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:04,306
- Get out. - Get out, Kwang Soo.

727
00:26:04,406 --> 00:26:06,107
- Wait. - He deserves no score.

728
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:07,142
- I have one more. - No way.

729
00:26:07,142 --> 00:26:08,777
- Really? - I have more.

730
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:10,879
- It's over if you're lying. - I have one more.

731
00:26:11,012 --> 00:26:15,584
What So Min brought last time...

732
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,653
- made me think a lot. - That's great.

733
00:26:20,322 --> 00:26:26,361
(So Min brought a napkin that she used when she broke up.)

734
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:30,465
It's from my heart. Everyone here knows what happened...

735
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:32,100
during Entertainment Awards last year.

736
00:26:33,401 --> 00:26:41,409
(Kwang Soo's speech after receiving the Grand Prize)

737
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,846
I was about to cry.

738
00:26:45,547 --> 00:26:46,548
Then...

739
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:48,550
Do you have something?

740
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:53,755
(Is it an item that relates to that moving moment?)

741
00:26:53,755 --> 00:26:55,690
I used this tissue to wipe off my tears.

742
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,727
(He used the tissue during the award ceremony.)

743
00:26:58,727 --> 00:27:01,396
(You're such a crook.)

744
00:27:01,396 --> 00:27:03,832
Wait, it's too wet.

745
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:05,033
- I'm serious. - Forget it.

746
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:06,234
- What? - One.

747
00:27:06,234 --> 00:27:08,103
- Wait, why? - In 1, 2, 3.

748
00:27:08,203 --> 00:27:09,638
- How can it be so wet? - Come on.

749
00:27:09,638 --> 00:27:11,907
- He gets a "Poor". - It wiped off my tears.

750
00:27:11,907 --> 00:27:14,242
- That's nonsense. - Why did you copy mine?

751
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,511
Her tears count,

752
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:18,179
- but are mine nasal discharge? - Kwang Soo.

753
00:27:20,315 --> 00:27:21,950
- I'll take a box of sweet potatoes. - Okay.

754
00:27:22,751 --> 00:27:24,653
Everyone.

755
00:27:24,653 --> 00:27:28,390
My story is another tearjerker.

756
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,391
I see.

757
00:27:29,424 --> 00:27:32,460
My friend invited me.

758
00:27:32,761 --> 00:27:34,062
- To a party? - To his house.

759
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:36,398
I spent the Christmas with my friends.

760
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:39,267
He also invited girls in his neighborhood.

761
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:40,468
- Goodness. - Pardon me?

762
00:27:40,468 --> 00:27:41,569
(It's a heart fluttering moment.)

763
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:43,939
I wanted to impress them.

764
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,440
Did you pull another trick?

765
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,775
No, I didn't.

766
00:27:46,775 --> 00:27:49,577
Wearing a golden ring...

767
00:27:49,577 --> 00:27:51,746
seemed cool at that time.

768
00:27:51,746 --> 00:27:54,015
However, I didn't have one.

769
00:27:55,283 --> 00:27:57,519
It looks like a golden ring, doesn't it?

770
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:58,687
- What is it? - Is it a coin?

771
00:27:58,687 --> 00:28:02,057
I didn't have it then, but I asked someone.

772
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,726
When you clean a brass ring with toothpaste,

773
00:28:05,193 --> 00:28:07,028
it looks like it's 14K gold.

774
00:28:07,262 --> 00:28:08,663
It looks like gold.

775
00:28:08,663 --> 00:28:10,198
It really does.

776
00:28:10,198 --> 00:28:11,199
- That's interesting. - Is it brass?

777
00:28:11,199 --> 00:28:12,767
When I saw that...

778
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,670
my friend had the ring, I borrowed it from him.

779
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,939
It looked like I was wearing a golden ring.

780
00:28:18,206 --> 00:28:19,975
- You wanted to look impressive? - Yes.

781
00:28:20,141 --> 00:28:21,943
I had it on for two hours.

782
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:23,912
After a while,

783
00:28:24,646 --> 00:28:26,348
black dirt got stuck on my finger.

784
00:28:26,948 --> 00:28:28,316
It was due to moisture.

785
00:28:28,316 --> 00:28:29,351
(I know what it is.)

786
00:28:29,351 --> 00:28:30,452
- I know. - I had no idea.

787
00:28:30,652 --> 00:28:31,653
I had no idea.

788
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:34,222
Black dirt kept getting stuck,

789
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:37,292
so I kept wiping it off with saliva.

790
00:28:38,193 --> 00:28:39,894
- That's funny. - Gosh.

791
00:28:39,894 --> 00:28:41,029
Seriously.

792
00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:42,931
Let me tell you.

793
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:44,432
You called me that day.

794
00:28:44,733 --> 00:28:46,234
He asked if I had one, and I said no.

795
00:28:46,234 --> 00:28:49,804
I asked him if he had one, and he said, "Of course I don't."

796
00:28:50,138 --> 00:28:51,139
To be honest...

797
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:52,574
That's what he said.

798
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:54,909
I remembered what happened.

799
00:28:55,977 --> 00:28:57,479
In 1, 2, 3.

800
00:28:57,846 --> 00:29:01,016
(Jae Seok gets Poor.)

801
00:29:01,016 --> 00:29:02,283
Who gave him "Fair"?

802
00:29:02,517 --> 00:29:03,651
- So Min? - Hey.

803
00:29:03,651 --> 00:29:06,121
Are you saying that his is better than mine?

804
00:29:06,554 --> 00:29:09,958
Are you saying that's better than my memory with my mother?

805
00:29:10,025 --> 00:29:12,927
Gosh, thank you, So Min.

806
00:29:13,028 --> 00:29:15,030
- Your story was so sad. - Right?

807
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,865
You're my enemy from now on.

808
00:29:17,232 --> 00:29:20,101
He wanted to wipe off the trace of his poverty.

809
00:29:20,101 --> 00:29:21,102
That's right.

810
00:29:21,102 --> 00:29:22,537
That's ridiculous.

811
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:24,739
It's what happened when he tried to seduce women.

812
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:26,841
(Poverty, my foot. He was trying to seduce women.)

813
00:29:26,841 --> 00:29:28,243
- Jong Kook. - It's not a trace of poverty.

814
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:29,577
How could you say that?

815
00:29:29,577 --> 00:29:30,745
- What do you mean? - You can't say that.

816
00:29:30,745 --> 00:29:32,714
If you can't afford it, you shouldn't pretend.

817
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:34,949
- You're so rude. - Goodness.

818
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:36,518
Goodness.

819
00:29:37,052 --> 00:29:38,787
It doesn't deserve a "Fair".

820
00:29:38,787 --> 00:29:40,055
I'll take the clementines.

821
00:29:40,522 --> 00:29:41,656
A box of clementines?

822
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:43,958
It deserves at least a "Fair".

823
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:45,360
(Jae Seok wins a box of clementines.)

824
00:29:45,693 --> 00:29:47,328
- Goodness. - Gosh.

825
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:48,663
My sincerity was rejected.

826
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:49,864
Sincerity?

827
00:29:50,098 --> 00:29:51,933
I should have made up a story...

828
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:53,468
instead of telling an honest one.

829
00:29:53,468 --> 00:29:55,937
- I brought something very precious. - Gosh.

830
00:29:55,937 --> 00:29:59,741
- Me too. - How do we get the presents?

831
00:30:02,077 --> 00:30:04,245
(Suddenly)

832
00:30:04,579 --> 00:30:05,647
- What's going on? - What?

833
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:07,382
- What happened? - What is it?

834
00:30:07,482 --> 00:30:09,517
They're stealing the presents.

835
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:11,319
- Don't do that. - No.

836
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,520
Don't do it.

837
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,123
Gosh, what's going on?

838
00:30:15,123 --> 00:30:16,491
(The light comes back on.)

839
00:30:16,491 --> 00:30:19,327
(However, the light is red.)

840
00:30:19,894 --> 00:30:21,296
(What kind of party is this?)

841
00:30:21,296 --> 00:30:24,833
The presents that you received disappeared.

842
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:26,267
(The presents that you received disappeared.)

843
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:31,005
(Their Christmas presents disappeared.)

844
00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:33,041
Did one of us take it?

845
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:34,776
- Is it one of us? - Really?

846
00:30:34,843 --> 00:30:36,244
- No way. - Did someone take it?

847
00:30:36,244 --> 00:30:38,046
- How dare you, punks? - No way.

848
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:39,948
Kwang Soo, did you take them again?

849
00:30:39,948 --> 00:30:40,949
It wasn't me.

850
00:30:41,116 --> 00:30:44,853
You're at Horror School with a story of ghosts.

851
00:30:44,853 --> 00:30:47,322
(Welcome to Horror School.)

852
00:30:48,256 --> 00:30:51,493
(It's Horror School with a story of ghosts.)

853
00:30:51,493 --> 00:30:52,994
(It's Running Horror School, )

854
00:30:52,994 --> 00:30:54,829
(a secret shelter for dissatisfied ghosts.)

855
00:30:54,829 --> 00:30:56,264
Come on.

856
00:30:56,331 --> 00:30:58,199
This isn't appropriate for year-end festivities.

857
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,869
- Don't bring us ghosts. - Seriously.

858
00:31:00,869 --> 00:31:02,270
It's Christmas.

859
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,738
Why are there ghosts again?

860
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:06,774
There are ghosts among the members.

861
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:08,143
Among us?

862
00:31:08,376 --> 00:31:09,978
(There are ghost or ghosts...)

863
00:31:09,978 --> 00:31:12,113
(here to ruin Christmas.)

864
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,124
There are ghosts among the members.

865
00:31:15,716 --> 00:31:16,851
Among us?

866
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,180
(There are ghost or ghosts...)

867
00:31:18,186 --> 00:31:20,321
(here to ruin Christmas.)

868
00:31:20,388 --> 00:31:22,657
If one person survives...

869
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,993
and stands on the platform that only humans can...

870
00:31:25,126 --> 00:31:27,595
when a rooster crows at dawn, that person wins.

871
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:29,697
They take all the gifts.

872
00:31:29,697 --> 00:31:31,866
- Only one person? - My game console.

873
00:31:31,866 --> 00:31:35,203
That means the ghost has to become human to take the gifts.

874
00:31:35,203 --> 00:31:37,172
There are two ways for a ghost to become human.

875
00:31:37,505 --> 00:31:39,707
They can either eliminate a human...

876
00:31:39,741 --> 00:31:41,242
or get their revenge.

877
00:31:41,242 --> 00:31:43,278
They can then be reborn as human.

878
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:44,679
(There are two ways to be reborn as human.)

879
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:46,147
- How do you get your revenge? - What's that?

880
00:31:46,748 --> 00:31:48,283
Every time you win a mission,

881
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:50,118
you can find out the identity of the member of your choice,

882
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:52,253
so please try your best.

883
00:31:53,087 --> 00:31:55,356
(They don't know how many ghosts there are.)

884
00:31:55,356 --> 00:31:57,559
(Who are they?)

885
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:59,060
This mission is...

886
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,762
Frightening Box.

887
00:32:00,762 --> 00:32:02,730
It's this again.

888
00:32:03,198 --> 00:32:04,866
- It's been a while. - It's something frightening.

889
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:07,468
Find a box with the R flag on it inside the school,

890
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:09,938
- and check the mission. - I can't go.

891
00:32:10,238 --> 00:32:12,840
Put a blindfold on with a camera attached to it.

892
00:32:13,408 --> 00:32:15,843
Put your head inside the box, and reveal the question.

893
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:19,881
If the other members can answer the question on the monitor, you win.

894
00:32:19,881 --> 00:32:21,349
You'll win a hint.

895
00:32:21,616 --> 00:32:22,750
This is a group mission.

896
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,818
(2 people will find the box, and 6 will solve the question.)

897
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:24,953
All right.

898
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:26,154
Who would like to go?

899
00:32:26,521 --> 00:32:28,389
- Let's do rock-paper-scissors. - All right.

900
00:32:28,389 --> 00:32:29,557
(Nobody wants to look for the box.)

901
00:32:29,557 --> 00:32:30,692
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors.

902
00:32:30,858 --> 00:32:32,026
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors.

903
00:32:32,026 --> 00:32:33,228
No, ready or not...

904
00:32:33,228 --> 00:32:34,329
You lose then.

905
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:35,597
(You want to do it again?)

906
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:39,434
(Everybody went, but he didn't.)

907
00:32:39,434 --> 00:32:40,902
- No. Why? - You lose.

908
00:32:40,902 --> 00:32:42,136
- You didn't go. - Exactly.

909
00:32:42,136 --> 00:32:43,671
(He eliminates himself.)

910
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:45,006
- You didn't go. - Exactly.

911
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,507
Rock...

912
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:47,642
You said it yourself.

913
00:32:47,642 --> 00:32:49,677
We got one person. We need another one.

914
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:51,346
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors.

915
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:53,047
(They're picking another person to join Seok Jin.)

916
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:55,083
(Jong Kook and Haha lose.)

917
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:57,118
Okay. Is it you and me?

918
00:32:57,218 --> 00:32:58,253
- That's fine. - There's Seok Jin too.

919
00:32:58,253 --> 00:32:59,887
We have 1 person already, so 1 of you are going.

920
00:33:00,088 --> 00:33:01,289
Rock-paper-scissors.

921
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:03,157
(Who's going to be Seok Jin's partner?)

922
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:05,560
(It's Haha.)

923
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,661
- My gosh. - Oh, dear.

924
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:08,997
This is bad.

925
00:33:08,997 --> 00:33:10,198
(It's a pair of cowards.)

926
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:12,133
- They're cowards. - This will be better.

927
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:14,002
They'll react better.

928
00:33:14,302 --> 00:33:16,137
- It's the two cowards. - Right.

929
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:18,640
- They should go. - I'm reassured.

930
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:21,943
I should have played in the beginning.

931
00:33:22,977 --> 00:33:24,445
That's why he lost.

932
00:33:24,746 --> 00:33:27,482
The person who doesn't play loses.

933
00:33:27,482 --> 00:33:29,384
(They start looking for the Frightening Box.)

934
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:30,551
Are they going down?

935
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:32,186
(They start looking for the Frightening Box.)

936
00:33:32,186 --> 00:33:33,821
My neck is stiff.

937
00:33:33,821 --> 00:33:35,790
This is driving me nuts.

938
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,458
(They must search 1st to the 3rd floor and find the R flag.)

939
00:33:38,192 --> 00:33:39,927
- I don't think I can do this. - Goodness.

940
00:33:40,128 --> 00:33:41,396
Nevis!

941
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:44,132
(Give me some power, Nevis Swing.)

942
00:33:44,999 --> 00:33:46,868
Gosh, this is insane.

943
00:33:46,868 --> 00:33:48,102
I can't do this.

944
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:51,472
Let's see how this works out.

945
00:33:51,472 --> 00:33:53,308
(They can hear Haha and Seok Jin from the 4th floor.)

946
00:33:53,308 --> 00:33:54,475
Since...

947
00:33:54,475 --> 00:33:55,576
(That was unexpected.)

948
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:58,713
Since this round is a group mission, you must share the pain.

949
00:33:58,713 --> 00:34:00,281
Every time they scream,

950
00:34:00,281 --> 00:34:02,583
you'll get penalties of different strengths.

951
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,018
What penalties are you talking about?

952
00:34:04,886 --> 00:34:07,088
(Every time those 2 get scared, )

953
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:10,058
(the 6 of them will have to share the pain.)

954
00:34:10,058 --> 00:34:12,093
Those two scream a lot.

955
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:13,328
Of course, they will.

956
00:34:13,328 --> 00:34:14,796
(They'll scream so much.)

957
00:34:14,796 --> 00:34:18,199
(Will Haha and Seok Jin be brave and succeed?)

958
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,434
Your eyes are glazed over.

959
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:20,601
(Haha's already frightened.)

960
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:21,836
They don't look right.

961
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:24,305
Where do we go?

962
00:34:24,305 --> 00:34:25,640
(They enter after 10 minutes.)

963
00:34:26,507 --> 00:34:28,743
I don't like this song.

964
00:34:28,843 --> 00:34:30,078
Why this music?

965
00:34:30,511 --> 00:34:31,813
Where do we go?

966
00:34:32,013 --> 00:34:33,147
What do we do?

967
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:35,249
Where do we go? Will you tell us?

968
00:34:35,249 --> 00:34:36,317
Is there a mission?

969
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:37,685
(What?)

970
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:39,687
There's somebody there.

971
00:34:39,687 --> 00:34:41,689
- This is driving me nuts. - Goodness.

972
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:47,128
- Gosh. - This is insane.

973
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:48,363
Do you want to run?

974
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:50,298
The mission might be here.

975
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:53,301
(They gather up the courage to enter the first classroom.)

976
00:34:57,705 --> 00:35:00,041
(Come, spirits.)

977
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:03,678
(Are you here?)

978
00:35:04,345 --> 00:35:06,481
You scared me. This is insane.

979
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:08,015
I can't go.

980
00:35:08,015 --> 00:35:09,951
How can we go? Are they crazy?

981
00:35:09,951 --> 00:35:11,953
I'm so sorry. I can't do this.

982
00:35:12,854 --> 00:35:15,089
- For goodness' sake. - What's that?

983
00:35:15,089 --> 00:35:16,758
What?

984
00:35:16,758 --> 00:35:17,892
(There's a girl coming.)

985
00:35:17,892 --> 00:35:19,727
- She's coming down. - My gosh.

986
00:35:19,861 --> 00:35:24,999
(Wherever they go, there are ghosts.)

987
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:26,768
- She's coming down. - She is.

988
00:35:26,768 --> 00:35:28,035
- She's coming down. - She's coming down.

989
00:35:28,035 --> 00:35:29,670
- Don't come. - Darn it.

990
00:35:30,037 --> 00:35:31,706
- Haha. - Darn it.

991
00:35:31,939 --> 00:35:34,275
- Gosh. - Gosh, she's coming down.

992
00:35:35,209 --> 00:35:36,477
I won't do this.

993
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:38,813
- Mission incomplete. - She's coming down.

994
00:35:38,813 --> 00:35:40,047
Mission incomplete.

995
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:42,617
This is insane.

996
00:35:42,617 --> 00:35:44,519
This is totally insane.

997
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:45,653
I can't do this!

998
00:35:45,653 --> 00:35:46,988
I can't do this at all.

999
00:35:47,088 --> 00:35:48,289
I won't.

1000
00:35:48,723 --> 00:35:50,057
I'm not joking. I can't do this.

1001
00:35:50,057 --> 00:35:52,026
- I can't even get past this. - Goodness.

1002
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:53,628
We can't even look.

1003
00:35:53,628 --> 00:35:54,896
(They're scared already.)

1004
00:35:54,896 --> 00:35:56,497
Call the producer, and say we can't do this.

1005
00:35:57,498 --> 00:36:00,201
(They were screaming so much.)

1006
00:36:00,568 --> 00:36:02,069
- I can't. - What's that?

1007
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:03,738
They screamed,

1008
00:36:04,038 --> 00:36:05,106
so you get a penalty.

1009
00:36:05,106 --> 00:36:06,340
What's that?

1010
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:11,846
(What will they have to do to share the pain?)

1011
00:36:12,513 --> 00:36:13,848
What is it?

1012
00:36:14,148 --> 00:36:15,483
Fans? It's cold.

1013
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,552
Are you crazy?

1014
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:18,619
It's cold.

1015
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:20,087
(Level 1: Fans)

1016
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,989
It's so cold.

1017
00:36:22,457 --> 00:36:23,591
No way.

1018
00:36:23,591 --> 00:36:25,026
- Are these real fans? - It's cold already.

1019
00:36:25,026 --> 00:36:26,093
Fans in this weather?

1020
00:36:26,427 --> 00:36:27,662
I can see my breath.

1021
00:36:27,662 --> 00:36:28,796
There are more fans.

1022
00:36:28,796 --> 00:36:29,997
The wind...

1023
00:36:30,131 --> 00:36:31,165
It's okay.

1024
00:36:31,165 --> 00:36:32,767
- I can see my breath. - It's so cold.

1025
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:35,036
- It's so cold. - I can see my breath.

1026
00:36:35,036 --> 00:36:36,871
It's more than minus 10°C outside.

1027
00:36:37,338 --> 00:36:39,173
Why did we make those two go?

1028
00:36:39,173 --> 00:36:40,341
(It's 1 fan per person.)

1029
00:36:40,341 --> 00:36:42,577
Next time they scream, there will be water guns.

1030
00:36:42,577 --> 00:36:43,678
- What? - Now?

1031
00:36:43,678 --> 00:36:44,779
(Water guns are the next penalty.)

1032
00:36:44,779 --> 00:36:46,280
(Fans and water guns?)

1033
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,448
Water guns?

1034
00:36:48,049 --> 00:36:49,116
Water guns?

1035
00:36:49,116 --> 00:36:50,151
Didn't the water freeze?

1036
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:54,088
What's wrong with her?

1037
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:56,090
Hey, go back up. It's okay.

1038
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,192
- Go home. It's late. - Go back up.

1039
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:01,295
- My gosh. - This is driving me nuts.

1040
00:37:01,295 --> 00:37:02,630
This is insane.

1041
00:37:03,431 --> 00:37:04,565
- Goodness. - What?

1042
00:37:04,565 --> 00:37:05,867
(Screaming)

1043
00:37:05,867 --> 00:37:07,101
Why did I not play...

1044
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:08,836
rock-paper-scissors and lose?

1045
00:37:08,836 --> 00:37:12,073
Why did I not play? Why did I do that?

1046
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,942
- My gosh. - Okay.

1047
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:16,110
- Let's go. - Hold on.

1048
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,745
- They're all people, right? - They won't kill us.

1049
00:37:17,745 --> 00:37:18,846
They're all people.

1050
00:37:18,846 --> 00:37:21,182
- How are we supposed to do this? - We have our cameramen too.

1051
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:23,050
Right. Let's go.

1052
00:37:24,886 --> 00:37:26,020
Don't come down.

1053
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:27,889
- Don't push me, Seok Jin. - I won't.

1054
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,591
Can you turn the music off?

1055
00:37:31,158 --> 00:37:33,661
Close your ears. It's less scary...

1056
00:37:33,828 --> 00:37:35,963
- without the music. - That's what is driving me nuts.

1057
00:37:37,198 --> 00:37:39,000
I can't open the door.

1058
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,301
(Creaking)

1059
00:37:41,602 --> 00:37:44,138
(There's a security guard in his office.)

1060
00:37:44,138 --> 00:37:45,339
It's the security guard.

1061
00:37:45,606 --> 00:37:46,741
Salute.

1062
00:37:47,608 --> 00:37:48,609
(It's a good place to hide something.)

1063
00:37:48,609 --> 00:37:50,177
Is he a person or a doll?

1064
00:37:51,646 --> 00:37:52,747
Sir.

1065
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,116
Sir?

1066
00:37:57,518 --> 00:37:59,253
(They're terrified.)

1067
00:37:59,253 --> 00:38:00,521
I'm not doing this.

1068
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:02,690
(They return to the starting point because of the security guard.)

1069
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:03,858
- My gosh. - Goodness.

1070
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:05,059
I can't do this.

1071
00:38:06,928 --> 00:38:08,262
I can't do this.

1072
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:10,298
I hate myself too.

1073
00:38:11,032 --> 00:38:12,400
I'm not being helpful to the team.

1074
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,468
I want to be recognized in the awards ceremony,

1075
00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:16,037
but I can't do this.

1076
00:38:16,103 --> 00:38:17,238
This is a fail.

1077
00:38:18,706 --> 00:38:22,710
(He always congratulates other people during the awards ceremony.)

1078
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:26,447
(I wanted to have the spotlight this year.)

1079
00:38:26,447 --> 00:38:27,882
I can't do this.

1080
00:38:27,882 --> 00:38:29,817
(Stay tuned for Haha's 2018.)

1081
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:32,286
Goodness.

1082
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,221
My gosh.

1083
00:38:34,221 --> 00:38:35,656
(The water guns are loaded because Haha screamed.)

1084
00:38:35,656 --> 00:38:36,757
It's cold.

1085
00:38:36,757 --> 00:38:38,392
(They have launched.)

1086
00:38:38,392 --> 00:38:39,527
It's cold.

1087
00:38:39,827 --> 00:38:40,962
It's cold.

1088
00:38:41,295 --> 00:38:42,830
- It's cold. - Tell them not to scream.

1089
00:38:43,297 --> 00:38:44,599
Gosh, this is insane.

1090
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:47,568
How long is it going to take them to go inside the room?

1091
00:38:48,636 --> 00:38:50,371
- Seok Jin. - We have to do this.

1092
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:51,606
They're all people.

1093
00:38:51,606 --> 00:38:52,907
- We have to do this. - Go.

1094
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:55,810
- What? Why? - We have to do this.

1095
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,678
I'm mad.

1096
00:38:58,045 --> 00:39:00,047
They keep doing this because I always get scared.

1097
00:39:00,848 --> 00:39:03,017
If we don't get scared, they won't do this.

1098
00:39:04,251 --> 00:39:05,319
Sir.

1099
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:06,487
(It sounds like fireworks.)

1100
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:07,922
Sir.

1101
00:39:07,922 --> 00:39:09,590
(Screaming)

1102
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,758
Hold on.

1103
00:39:10,758 --> 00:39:13,060
(Are those poppers?)

1104
00:39:13,728 --> 00:39:15,296
I'm so mad.

1105
00:39:15,429 --> 00:39:16,731
I'm so mad.

1106
00:39:17,031 --> 00:39:18,733
- My gosh. - Again.

1107
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:20,067
That doesn't count.

1108
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:21,769
That's how he talks.

1109
00:39:22,036 --> 00:39:23,137
It's cold.

1110
00:39:23,237 --> 00:39:24,905
My head is cold.

1111
00:39:25,673 --> 00:39:26,941
It's so cold.

1112
00:39:26,941 --> 00:39:28,409
(Shivering)

1113
00:39:29,377 --> 00:39:30,978
Can we just...

1114
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:36,183
face the fans toward one person who loses rock-paper-scissors?

1115
00:39:36,183 --> 00:39:37,518
- Don't rotate it. - Just one person.

1116
00:39:37,518 --> 00:39:38,552
- It's for 1 person. - Fix them on 1 person.

1117
00:39:38,786 --> 00:39:39,887
- It's for one person. - You can't rotate the fans.

1118
00:39:39,887 --> 00:39:41,455
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors.

1119
00:39:41,856 --> 00:39:42,990
Rock-paper-scissors.

1120
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:45,126
- Ji Hyo wins. - Only she won.

1121
00:39:45,126 --> 00:39:46,527
(Ji Hyo wins by herself.)

1122
00:39:46,627 --> 00:39:47,828
Okay, the two of us.

1123
00:39:47,828 --> 00:39:49,797
(Kwang Soo and Jong Kook are exempted next.)

1124
00:39:50,297 --> 00:39:51,666
- Okay. - No, it's the three of you.

1125
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:54,201
(Jae Seok, So Min, and Se Chan remain now.)

1126
00:39:54,201 --> 00:39:55,770
Hey, you must win.

1127
00:39:55,836 --> 00:39:57,438
- I'll feel the fans too. - All right.

1128
00:39:57,438 --> 00:40:00,041
Rock-paper-scissors.

1129
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:01,542
(Jae Seok wins.)

1130
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,946
- My gosh. - So Min, you have to win.

1131
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:07,348
- Which one should I play? - This is... Goodness.

1132
00:40:07,348 --> 00:40:08,549
- Rock-paper-scissors - Scissors.

1133
00:40:08,883 --> 00:40:10,151
- Rock... - Hold on.

1134
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:11,152
(The loser will feel the biting cold.)

1135
00:40:11,152 --> 00:40:12,186
(6 fans at minus 10°C)

1136
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:14,088
It's minus 10°C outside.

1137
00:40:14,088 --> 00:40:15,790
(Which one will get to monopolize the fans and the water guns?)

1138
00:40:18,025 --> 00:40:19,360
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors.

1139
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,529
(So Min gets the penalty.)

1140
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:22,563
Okay!

1141
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:25,399
(Is it me? I'm so dead.)

1142
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,901
We should switch every minute.

1143
00:40:26,901 --> 00:40:28,135
- Let's do that. - I like that.

1144
00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:32,606
- Hey, So Min. - They work hard for penalties.

1145
00:40:32,606 --> 00:40:34,675
(Kwang Soo and Se Chan want to share the warmth of the holidays.)

1146
00:40:34,675 --> 00:40:36,010
My gosh, they are the nicest.

1147
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:39,046
- They are both the kindest. - Seriously.

1148
00:40:39,046 --> 00:40:41,582
- They are full of love. - They can't be more affectionate.

1149
00:40:41,582 --> 00:40:42,783
Kwang Soo, you must turn it a bit.

1150
00:40:42,783 --> 00:40:44,018
Goodness, I feel so grateful.

1151
00:40:44,018 --> 00:40:45,820
Hey, this is like that place when you go...

1152
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,856
Hey, So Min. You look like you're in a music video.

1153
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,391
So Min, it's like a music video.

1154
00:40:50,391 --> 00:40:52,159
(Her attitude changes. My gosh, did I look pretty?)

1155
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:53,227
She's enjoying this too.

1156
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,129
- Here it comes. - So Min, here's the camera.

1157
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:56,897
- The jib camera is filming her. - The jib camera.

1158
00:40:56,897 --> 00:40:57,998
The cameraman is filming her.

1159
00:40:57,998 --> 00:41:00,901
(She targets the advertisers' hearts with the biting cold.)

1160
00:41:01,302 --> 00:41:03,037
(However, the guys are frozen at heart.)

1161
00:41:03,037 --> 00:41:04,839
- I love how windy this is. - She likes it too much.

1162
00:41:06,807 --> 00:41:09,009
(The fans last long.)

1163
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:12,213
(These advanced fans have an exceptional mobility.)

1164
00:41:13,047 --> 00:41:16,517
(Running Motor Fans)

1165
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:19,887
I bet she'll come down with a cold now.

1166
00:41:19,987 --> 00:41:21,822
- Let's do it again. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1167
00:41:21,822 --> 00:41:23,257
- Okay. - The loser stays in the middle.

1168
00:41:23,257 --> 00:41:24,358
- My gosh. - Okay. Rock-paper-scissors.

1169
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:26,026
- Goodness. - It's so cold in this seat.

1170
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:27,128
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors.

1171
00:41:27,328 --> 00:41:28,295
Rock-paper-scissors.

1172
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:29,396
- You didn't play that, right? - Gosh.

1173
00:41:29,396 --> 00:41:30,397
Okay. It's Jae Seok.

1174
00:41:30,397 --> 00:41:31,632
(Jae Seok, the unlucky one, loses.)

1175
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:32,700
We didn't set you up.

1176
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,301
- This is so amazing. - We didn't set this up.

1177
00:41:34,635 --> 00:41:36,737
Seriously?

1178
00:41:36,837 --> 00:41:39,173
(He feels the piercing cold as soon as he sits down.)

1179
00:41:40,107 --> 00:41:41,108
Hey, it's freezing.

1180
00:41:41,108 --> 00:41:42,109
(Everyone else isn't that cold.)

1181
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:43,778
- How does it feel? - My minute hasn't passed yet?

1182
00:41:43,778 --> 00:41:45,012
- What are you talking about? - Not even close.

1183
00:41:45,012 --> 00:41:46,547
- It just started. - It's not over yet.

1184
00:41:46,647 --> 00:41:47,948
Only three seconds passed.

1185
00:41:48,849 --> 00:41:49,917
- Wait. - What is it?

1186
00:41:51,352 --> 00:41:53,087
(Plopping down)

1187
00:41:56,123 --> 00:41:57,458
Why are you sitting over there?

1188
00:41:57,758 --> 00:42:00,161
If they happen to scream...

1189
00:42:00,661 --> 00:42:01,695
I see how it is.

1190
00:42:02,463 --> 00:42:04,598
(That looks fun. Then should I join her?)

1191
00:42:04,598 --> 00:42:05,933
- She's doing it. - Was it done on purpose?

1192
00:42:08,002 --> 00:42:09,370
- She looks like a sniper. - Hey.

1193
00:42:09,403 --> 00:42:11,238
- Are you doing that on purpose? - Don't fire that at me.

1194
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:12,740
(Is Kwang Soo joining them too?)

1195
00:42:13,941 --> 00:42:14,942
Are you doing that on purpose?

1196
00:42:15,009 --> 00:42:16,110
Hey, that's not cool.

1197
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,878
- What do you mean? - You can't do that.

1198
00:42:17,912 --> 00:42:19,013
- You can't do that. - Why not?

1199
00:42:19,013 --> 00:42:20,247
- You can't. - That's too much.

1200
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:21,382
- You went too far. - Seriously?

1201
00:42:21,382 --> 00:42:23,017
- That's not a water gun. - He's not reading the room.

1202
00:42:23,017 --> 00:42:24,118
He's drinking it.

1203
00:42:24,852 --> 00:42:26,720
I feel like I'm going to hit you.

1204
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,788
Is it the same place?

1205
00:42:28,389 --> 00:42:29,390
(This time, it's the art classroom.)

1206
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,858
I can't do this.

1207
00:42:31,192 --> 00:42:32,193
Let's just go now.

1208
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,628
What is it? What do you want?

1209
00:42:34,628 --> 00:42:36,297
(Bellowing)

1210
00:42:36,297 --> 00:42:38,999
What do you want?

1211
00:42:38,999 --> 00:42:41,535
(The bust falls all of a sudden.)

1212
00:42:43,237 --> 00:42:44,905
(I have a feeling it must be in here.)

1213
00:42:44,905 --> 00:42:46,907
- Okay, okay. - That's not a real person.

1214
00:42:46,907 --> 00:42:48,576
(It must be somewhere here.)

1215
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:49,910
- We'll be fine. - What do you want?

1216
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,579
- We'll be okay. - The hint must be in here.

1217
00:42:52,713 --> 00:42:56,116
(Their hunches tell them it must be in the art classroom.)

1218
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:57,952
- Wait. What is that? - What is it?

1219
00:42:58,385 --> 00:43:00,487
(Screaming in fear)

1220
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:05,726
(Screeching)

1221
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:07,661
Hey.

1222
00:43:08,195 --> 00:43:09,296
- Seok Jin. - Hold on.

1223
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:11,732
- You totally squashed me. - I'm sorry.

1224
00:43:11,732 --> 00:43:13,000
(What are we doing?)

1225
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,669
- I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Gosh. - Seriously.

1226
00:43:15,669 --> 00:43:17,938
- Unbelievable. - Are you serious? Darn you.

1227
00:43:18,038 --> 00:43:20,541
- That scared the wits out of me. - Goodness. I can't believe it.

1228
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:21,709
Hey, you!

1229
00:43:21,842 --> 00:43:22,910
This is driving me crazy.

1230
00:43:25,012 --> 00:43:26,847
(As they scream, the water guns are fired.)

1231
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,048
What are you doing?

1232
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:29,316
It's freezing.

1233
00:43:29,917 --> 00:43:31,452
(Gosh, it's so cold.)

1234
00:43:31,452 --> 00:43:32,453
What are you doing?

1235
00:43:32,453 --> 00:43:35,289
(I should fire my water gun.)

1236
00:43:35,556 --> 00:43:37,992
(What just happened? What is this?)

1237
00:43:37,992 --> 00:43:41,629
(They betray even at this moment and target So Min.)

1238
00:43:42,029 --> 00:43:44,765
(We must get rid of any potential danger from the start.)

1239
00:43:47,268 --> 00:43:48,502
Gosh, So Min.

1240
00:43:50,137 --> 00:43:51,605
Ji Hyo, why did you shoot at my ears?

1241
00:43:52,806 --> 00:43:54,608
But why are we going after each other?

1242
00:43:54,775 --> 00:43:55,943
It's so cold.

1243
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:58,379
- I'm freezing. It's really cold. - It's freezing in here.

1244
00:43:58,412 --> 00:43:59,647
It's really cold.

1245
00:43:59,647 --> 00:44:00,648
(The penalty is put to shame.)

1246
00:44:00,948 --> 00:44:02,549
- We are in trouble. - I'm so cold.

1247
00:44:02,716 --> 00:44:05,920
- I'm freezing. - Why must we attack each other?

1248
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,721
So Min, put that down.

1249
00:44:07,721 --> 00:44:08,756
(The staff had no part in this.)

1250
00:44:08,756 --> 00:44:10,291
I told you to put it down. My gosh.

1251
00:44:11,725 --> 00:44:13,827
Are they going to take three days to find the box?

1252
00:44:13,827 --> 00:44:15,262
Until when should we wait?

1253
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:18,165
This must be it.

1254
00:44:18,766 --> 00:44:19,800
This is it.

1255
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,735
- This is the place. - Haha.

1256
00:44:21,735 --> 00:44:23,871
- Haha. - Yes, I'm here. Yes.

1257
00:44:23,871 --> 00:44:25,039
Are you all right?

1258
00:44:25,105 --> 00:44:26,740
- Yes, I'm fine. - I'm about to pass out.

1259
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:29,143
- We were so worried about you. - Yes, we were.

1260
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:32,780
- This is the mission. - He's more brave now.

1261
00:44:33,347 --> 00:44:34,481
"The time limit is three minutes."

1262
00:44:34,548 --> 00:44:36,317
"Put on the blindfold where the cameras are installed."

1263
00:44:36,517 --> 00:44:37,851
"Shine a light inside the frightening box."

1264
00:44:37,851 --> 00:44:40,321
"When six members accomplish the mission, it's a success."

1265
00:44:41,388 --> 00:44:43,557
Here I go. This is the real deal now.

1266
00:44:43,657 --> 00:44:45,359
Okay. Team Nevis Swing, you can do it!

1267
00:44:46,093 --> 00:44:47,127
Get ready.

1268
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:49,163
- Good luck. Try to figure it out. - Start.

1269
00:44:49,296 --> 00:44:51,398
- Get ready. - Good luck. Try to figure it out.

1270
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:53,000
(The mission begins.)

1271
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,468
Put your head deeper.

1272
00:44:55,769 --> 00:44:57,037
- He's outside. - We must figure out what it is.

1273
00:44:57,037 --> 00:44:58,572
- No, no. - Is that it?

1274
00:44:58,806 --> 00:45:00,841
(The point of view from Haha's camera)

1275
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:01,875
What do you see?

1276
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:03,277
- He didn't start yet, right? - My gosh, what is that?

1277
00:45:03,277 --> 00:45:04,912
- What is that? - Who is he?

1278
00:45:04,912 --> 00:45:06,547
(Is that a ghost?)

1279
00:45:07,581 --> 00:45:08,716
- What is that? - Are you serious?

1280
00:45:08,716 --> 00:45:11,018
- That startled me! - Goodness!

1281
00:45:11,018 --> 00:45:12,186
They must've gone mad!

1282
00:45:12,186 --> 00:45:13,187
(The mission is...)

1283
00:45:13,187 --> 00:45:14,521
(answer the question on the ghost's face.)

1284
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:15,622
Something is written on it.

1285
00:45:15,622 --> 00:45:16,890
- It's a person. - It's a person?

1286
00:45:16,957 --> 00:45:18,258
- Goodness! - Look at his face!

1287
00:45:18,258 --> 00:45:19,560
- No! - What was that?

1288
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,261
(He throws a fit.)

1289
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:22,363
They must've gone mad.

1290
00:45:22,363 --> 00:45:23,697
- What was it? - What was that?

1291
00:45:23,697 --> 00:45:25,366
- They must be out of their minds. - What?

1292
00:45:25,366 --> 00:45:27,301
- Something is written on it. - I just hear something exploding.

1293
00:45:27,301 --> 00:45:28,569
(He is delusional.)

1294
00:45:29,003 --> 00:45:32,006
- Face the front side. - Haha, shine the light inside.

1295
00:45:32,373 --> 00:45:33,407
(We'll only reveal it to you.)

1296
00:45:33,407 --> 00:45:34,842
Come on. Face the front already. Hurry.

1297
00:45:34,842 --> 00:45:36,043
(The question on the ghost's face is...)

1298
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:40,948
(Where is Santa Claus' hometown?)

1299
00:45:41,482 --> 00:45:42,783
Haha, get in there.

1300
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,885
I'm going in now. It's really happening now.

1301
00:45:47,488 --> 00:45:49,156
- "Santa Claus..." - "Santa..."

1302
00:45:50,858 --> 00:45:52,359
Move a bit to your right.

1303
00:45:52,393 --> 00:45:54,028
Lower the camera a bit.

1304
00:45:54,128 --> 00:45:57,297
(However, he's rigid.)

1305
00:45:57,698 --> 00:45:59,566
- Hold on. Lower it. - Haha, lower the camera.

1306
00:45:59,566 --> 00:46:01,201
- Lower it. - Move it down.

1307
00:46:01,402 --> 00:46:02,403
"Santa Claus..."

1308
00:46:02,403 --> 00:46:04,038
(His body is shaking.)

1309
00:46:05,572 --> 00:46:07,341
It's asking about the hometown.

1310
00:46:07,408 --> 00:46:08,675
"Where is Santa Claus' hometown?"

1311
00:46:08,909 --> 00:46:11,378
"Where is Santa Claus' hometown?"

1312
00:46:11,378 --> 00:46:12,946
(He finally read the question.)

1313
00:46:12,946 --> 00:46:16,250
(If they answer the question, they accomplish the mission.)

1314
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,385
(I don't know the answer, but please get it right!)

1315
00:46:18,385 --> 00:46:20,287
"Where is Santa Claus' hometown that he lives in?"

1316
00:46:20,287 --> 00:46:21,288
Finland.

1317
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:25,459
(Finland)

1318
00:46:25,459 --> 00:46:27,561
- You accomplished your mission. - Gosh, Finland.

1319
00:46:28,429 --> 00:46:29,463
What a relief.

1320
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:31,198
- He lives in Finland. - We got it right.

1321
00:46:31,198 --> 00:46:33,067
- We answered it correctly. - There's a Santa Village there.

1322
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,568
What did you say?

1323
00:46:34,568 --> 00:46:37,137
- Okay! - Great job! We got it right.

1324
00:46:37,237 --> 00:46:38,806
- Finland was the right answer? - Take off your blindfold now.

1325
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:42,309
- We're done now. My goodness. - I was so manly!

1326
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:43,811
- Manly? - You're a real man.

1327
00:46:43,811 --> 00:46:46,547
- You accomplished your mission. - Right.

1328
00:46:46,647 --> 00:46:48,715
We'll tell you the member's identity of your choice.

1329
00:46:49,216 --> 00:46:51,952
You're at Horror School where it's full of ghost stories.

1330
00:46:52,086 --> 00:46:54,788
There may be one or more ghosts among you.

1331
00:46:55,289 --> 00:46:57,558
- One of us should get the hint. - If you say that...

1332
00:46:57,558 --> 00:46:59,560
(We went through some rough patches.)

1333
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,028
If you say that, we'd be disappointed.

1334
00:47:01,028 --> 00:47:02,529
- Earlier... - We had a hard time here too.

1335
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:03,697
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - Okay.

1336
00:47:03,697 --> 00:47:05,799
- Okay! - I haven't won anything for ages.

1337
00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:07,167
(So Min and Se Chan will get the hint.)

1338
00:47:07,701 --> 00:47:08,902
I've never won at rock-paper-scissors.

1339
00:47:08,902 --> 00:47:12,339
(They can find out the identity of the member they'd like to know.)

1340
00:47:13,107 --> 00:47:16,043
(The identity of the member Se Chan wants to find out is...)

1341
00:47:16,043 --> 00:47:17,077
So Min.

1342
00:47:17,077 --> 00:47:18,846
(It's So Min.)

1343
00:47:18,846 --> 00:47:22,382
(Is So Min a ghost or a human?)

1344
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:24,318
The identity of So Min...

1345
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:26,286
(The identity of So Min...)

1346
00:47:26,286 --> 00:47:27,287
is a ghost.

1347
00:47:27,287 --> 00:47:29,523
(She's a ghost.)

1348
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:31,758
(So Min is...)

1349
00:47:31,758 --> 00:47:34,027
(a ghost.)

1350
00:47:34,361 --> 00:47:36,997
(He's shocked to find out So Min is a ghost.)

1351
00:47:37,998 --> 00:47:40,067
Name a member whose identity you want to find out.

1352
00:47:40,067 --> 00:47:41,568
(It's So Min's turn next.)

1353
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:42,603
Jae Seok.

1354
00:47:43,036 --> 00:47:44,037
(So Min asks about Jae Seok.)

1355
00:47:44,037 --> 00:47:45,305
The identity of Jae Seok...

1356
00:47:45,305 --> 00:47:46,507
(So Min asks about Jae Seok.)

1357
00:47:46,507 --> 00:47:49,510
(The identity of Jae Seok...)

1358
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:51,845
is a ghost.

1359
00:47:51,845 --> 00:47:54,648
(Jae Seok is also a ghost!)

1360
00:47:55,048 --> 00:47:57,918
(Jae Seok, you are a ghost too.)

1361
00:47:58,619 --> 00:47:59,887
(The identities of the ghosts unravel.)

1362
00:47:59,887 --> 00:48:02,189
(Then who are the humans among them?)

1363
00:48:03,757 --> 00:48:06,426
The final mission to put an end to the Nightmare of Christmas Race...

1364
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,395
is Tag with the Ghosts.

1365
00:48:08,395 --> 00:48:11,698
(The final mission is Tag with the Ghosts)

1366
00:48:12,132 --> 00:48:13,800
I seriously want to end this race.

1367
00:48:14,268 --> 00:48:15,702
- We'll play tag? - With ghosts?

1368
00:48:16,036 --> 00:48:20,607
Hints about the members' identities are scattered throughout the school.

1369
00:48:20,807 --> 00:48:22,709
Put the name of the member whose identity you want to find out,

1370
00:48:22,709 --> 00:48:24,311
and then you can find out their identity.

1371
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:25,913
There's a hint box.

1372
00:48:26,246 --> 00:48:27,748
After discovering their identities,

1373
00:48:27,748 --> 00:48:30,050
the last member who gets on the platform...

1374
00:48:30,217 --> 00:48:33,687
as a human before the rooster crows at dawn will win the race.

1375
00:48:33,987 --> 00:48:37,357
When you are not the only remaining human standing on the platform...

1376
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:40,127
We must eliminate whoever is remaining.

1377
00:48:40,127 --> 00:48:42,196
(You must eliminate other members until only 1 human remains.)

1378
00:48:42,896 --> 00:48:44,932
Ghosts can find out who the humans are...

1379
00:48:44,932 --> 00:48:46,767
and switch each other's identities.

1380
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:49,636
Humans can eliminate only humans,

1381
00:48:50,337 --> 00:48:51,438
but if a ghost eliminates another ghost,

1382
00:48:51,438 --> 00:48:52,806
the ghost, who removes the tag, will be eliminated.

1383
00:48:54,007 --> 00:48:56,910
My gosh. We can't eliminate just anyone.

1384
00:48:57,678 --> 00:49:02,249
Moreover, there are vengeful spirits who threaten the ghosts' existence.

1385
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:05,619
Vengeful spirits can be resurrected only when they eliminate ghosts.

1386
00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:07,821
(Vengeful spirits must eliminate ghosts to resurrect themselves.)

1387
00:49:07,821 --> 00:49:10,857
When vengeful spirits eliminate humans, they will be eliminated.

1388
00:49:10,857 --> 00:49:11,992
(They cannot eliminate humans.)

1389
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:13,126
There are vengeful spirits, humans,

1390
00:49:13,126 --> 00:49:14,361
- and ghosts. - They'll be eliminated.

1391
00:49:14,361 --> 00:49:18,031
Then we will head to where the race will be held today.

1392
00:49:18,031 --> 00:49:20,400
(Vengeful spirits can attack ghosts, but they cannot attack humans.)

1393
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,702
- Do it here? - Yes.

1394
00:49:22,202 --> 00:49:23,237
What's your identity?

1395
00:49:23,337 --> 00:49:24,338
I'm a ghost.

1396
00:49:25,572 --> 00:49:26,707
Jae Seok.

1397
00:49:27,407 --> 00:49:29,109
- This is how to let your grudge go. - What is this?

1398
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:30,577
(Ghosts can be humans after letting go of their grudges.)

1399
00:49:31,178 --> 00:49:33,280
"You died from lack of blood circulation from skinny jeans..."

1400
00:49:33,947 --> 00:49:35,749
What is this nonsense now?

1401
00:49:35,983 --> 00:49:38,518
"You're a ghost due to lack of blood circulation from skinny jeans."

1402
00:49:38,585 --> 00:49:41,088
"Three pairs of loose pants are hidden all over the school."

1403
00:49:41,088 --> 00:49:42,990
"Find them, put them on, let your grudge go, and become a human."

1404
00:49:43,857 --> 00:49:46,159
As soon as I become a human, I can go to the platform?

1405
00:49:46,193 --> 00:49:48,328
Yes, as long as you're the only human.

1406
00:49:48,328 --> 00:49:49,896
If you manage to survive...

1407
00:49:50,097 --> 00:49:52,599
and go up to the platform, you will be the winner.

1408
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:54,101
(He will win if he's the only human to survive.)

1409
00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:55,602
- If I am the only human? - Yes.

1410
00:49:56,937 --> 00:49:58,572
- Here's your mission. - Okay.

1411
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:00,707
- So Min. - Yes?

1412
00:50:01,241 --> 00:50:03,710
You died because you were wrongfully accused...

1413
00:50:05,379 --> 00:50:07,047
of having smelly scalp.

1414
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:09,483
Make a member...

1415
00:50:09,483 --> 00:50:11,318
smell your scalp...

1416
00:50:11,418 --> 00:50:14,388
and say, "It smells good."

1417
00:50:14,388 --> 00:50:16,356
Once you hear that, you will reincarnate as a human.

1418
00:50:18,592 --> 00:50:20,260
Dear viewers, it's not true.

1419
00:50:20,627 --> 00:50:22,663
My scalp doesn't smell that bad.

1420
00:50:22,663 --> 00:50:27,067
They were exaggerating when they said that.

1421
00:50:27,768 --> 00:50:30,537
Seok Jin's scalp smelled like rotten bread.

1422
00:50:32,005 --> 00:50:36,009
Seok Jin won't tell me the truth if I ask, would he?

1423
00:50:36,209 --> 00:50:37,811
He never trusted me.

1424
00:50:40,247 --> 00:50:42,582
I have no idea who the human is.

1425
00:50:44,518 --> 00:50:47,521
(You win only if you are the only human when a rooster crows at dawn.)

1426
00:50:48,388 --> 00:50:51,458
Let's begin the race.

1427
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:52,592
The countdown starts now.

1428
00:50:53,026 --> 00:50:54,027
Five.

1429
00:50:55,028 --> 00:50:56,129
Four.

1430
00:50:57,497 --> 00:50:58,498
Three.

1431
00:50:59,666 --> 00:51:01,101
- Two. - I'll go inside the music room.

1432
00:51:02,336 --> 00:51:04,838
One. The race starts.

1433
00:51:04,838 --> 00:51:07,240
(The race starts.)

1434
00:51:09,176 --> 00:51:10,811
I need to get out of this place.

1435
00:51:11,411 --> 00:51:12,679
I need to get out of this place fast.

1436
00:51:13,847 --> 00:51:15,048
(Someone plays an organ in the classroom.)

1437
00:51:15,048 --> 00:51:16,750
Why is she playing an organ alone?

1438
00:51:16,817 --> 00:51:19,419
(Someone plays an organ in the classroom.)

1439
00:51:22,456 --> 00:51:27,327
(Do re mi fa so la ti)

1440
00:51:29,496 --> 00:51:34,968
(Let's find the hint box fast and get out of this place.)

1441
00:51:35,502 --> 00:51:37,437
It's really scary.

1442
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:39,272
I am sorry.

1443
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,808
I can't remember what comes after this.

1444
00:51:42,476 --> 00:51:43,510
What?

1445
00:51:43,877 --> 00:51:45,912
I can't remember what comes after this.

1446
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:49,049
What can't you remember?

1447
00:51:49,383 --> 00:51:51,618
I can't remember what comes after this.

1448
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:53,286
What comes after this?

1449
00:51:54,221 --> 00:51:55,589
What was it?

1450
00:51:55,889 --> 00:51:57,858
(Do!)

1451
00:52:02,696 --> 00:52:07,801
(His heart nearly stops.)

1452
00:52:14,107 --> 00:52:16,576
I wondered why she stopped at ti.

1453
00:52:22,582 --> 00:52:26,386
(So Min the Ghost is looking for the hint.)

1454
00:52:26,386 --> 00:52:30,357
(She finds 2 girls who are communicating with a spirit.)

1455
00:52:30,357 --> 00:52:33,560
Tell me.

1456
00:52:35,896 --> 00:52:37,798
Didn't you see the hint?

1457
00:52:38,999 --> 00:52:40,267
Please.

1458
00:52:43,236 --> 00:52:44,738
Are you here?

1459
00:52:45,939 --> 00:52:53,346
(The spirit writes "O".)

1460
00:52:54,247 --> 00:52:57,417
Is the person here beautiful?

1461
00:52:57,417 --> 00:53:03,156
(Is the person here beautiful?)

1462
00:53:05,992 --> 00:53:10,497
(The ghost says, "No".)

1463
00:53:11,498 --> 00:53:12,732
Am I not pretty?

1464
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:16,837
You asked if I am beautiful, didn't you?

1465
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:20,907
Please tell me I am beautiful.

1466
00:53:22,042 --> 00:53:23,577
Please tell me I am beautiful.

1467
00:53:25,078 --> 00:53:26,179
I am really not beautiful.

1468
00:53:26,179 --> 00:53:28,048
(She couldn't care less about the hint.)

1469
00:53:28,048 --> 00:53:29,216
It's not here.

1470
00:53:30,817 --> 00:53:31,985
The hint is not here.

1471
00:53:31,985 --> 00:53:33,286
(Our spirit doesn't lie.)

1472
00:53:34,087 --> 00:53:35,655
I'm so scared.

1473
00:53:35,655 --> 00:53:37,657
(Haha is searching the nurse's office.)

1474
00:53:40,861 --> 00:53:42,395
Maybe something horrible will pop out.

1475
00:53:45,899 --> 00:53:47,000
Is someone in there?

1476
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:49,302
Raise the camera.

1477
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:51,671
Raise the camera and see if there's anyone.

1478
00:53:51,671 --> 00:53:54,040
(I feel like someone might be behind.)

1479
00:53:56,776 --> 00:53:58,612
(Someone screams.)

1480
00:53:58,612 --> 00:54:01,147
(I knew it.)

1481
00:54:02,582 --> 00:54:05,785
(Let's find the hint.)

1482
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:07,521
(Screaming)

1483
00:54:08,788 --> 00:54:11,091
(Did you think it was over?)

1484
00:54:13,226 --> 00:54:15,529
(The unexpected attack...)

1485
00:54:15,529 --> 00:54:19,299
(knocks him out.)

1486
00:54:20,267 --> 00:54:22,269
(Laughing)

1487
00:54:24,971 --> 00:54:26,506
Just kill me now.

1488
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,508
I want to get eliminated.

1489
00:54:28,775 --> 00:54:32,212
I can't do it.

1490
00:54:32,512 --> 00:54:33,780
I can't even speak.

1491
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:34,848
(I don't care about the race.)

1492
00:54:35,048 --> 00:54:36,316
No way.

1493
00:54:38,218 --> 00:54:40,687
Why did they turn on the red lights?

1494
00:54:42,856 --> 00:54:44,090
What's that? My gosh.

1495
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:45,358
(What is that?)

1496
00:54:45,525 --> 00:54:46,960
I think the hint box is there.

1497
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,228
(The hint box must be over there.)

1498
00:54:49,095 --> 00:54:50,196
Isn't that the box?

1499
00:54:53,066 --> 00:54:54,768
(Who are you?)

1500
00:54:56,536 --> 00:54:57,637
I can't do this.

1501
00:54:59,372 --> 00:55:00,607
I won't get the box.

1502
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,008
(Avoid scary things at all cost.)

1503
00:55:03,577 --> 00:55:05,378
(Screaming)

1504
00:55:07,447 --> 00:55:08,748
I can't do this.

1505
00:55:09,149 --> 00:55:11,117
(I will look for the hint next time.)

1506
00:55:11,117 --> 00:55:13,086
So this is how it's going to go today.

1507
00:55:15,322 --> 00:55:16,957
(Screaming)

1508
00:55:17,057 --> 00:55:18,291
- Hello. - What was that?

1509
00:55:18,592 --> 00:55:19,926
That surprised me.

1510
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:25,198
(Despite the fear, he walks towards the box.)

1511
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:30,437
(Hide well, I can see your hair)

1512
00:55:31,638 --> 00:55:33,907
(Who are you there?)

1513
00:55:33,907 --> 00:55:36,376
(That scared me.)

1514
00:55:37,677 --> 00:55:38,778
I found the box.

1515
00:55:39,779 --> 00:55:42,415
That's not the box.

1516
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:44,217
(What does he mean this is not the box?)

1517
00:55:44,417 --> 00:55:47,087
What do you mean this is not the box?

1518
00:55:47,921 --> 00:55:49,122
Is there really another box?

1519
00:55:50,256 --> 00:55:51,391
What's this?

1520
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,428
Where are you?

1521
00:55:56,796 --> 00:55:58,098
Are you here?

1522
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,668
What is she looking for?

1523
00:56:03,637 --> 00:56:04,838
What is she looking for?

1524
00:56:04,838 --> 00:56:06,306
(Why is she playing hide-and-seek in the school at this hour?)

1525
00:56:06,306 --> 00:56:07,741
Where are you?

1526
00:56:08,975 --> 00:56:10,076
What are you looking for?

1527
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:11,911
Where are you?

1528
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:17,117
(Is something in here?)

1529
00:56:18,218 --> 00:56:19,285
Where are you?

1530
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:21,788
I can't find you.

1531
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:23,390
Here I am!

1532
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:25,392
(Here I am!)

1533
00:56:26,359 --> 00:56:27,861
(Screaming)

1534
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:32,999
(Why would you come out of there?)

1535
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:37,337
(Why can't you find me?)

1536
00:56:38,638 --> 00:56:41,207
(I can't walk anymore.)

1537
00:56:41,207 --> 00:56:42,475
That scared me.

1538
00:56:46,446 --> 00:56:47,580
I can't do this anymore.

1539
00:56:48,548 --> 00:56:50,216
I want to quit. I can't do this.

1540
00:56:51,017 --> 00:56:52,252
I give up.

1541
00:56:52,986 --> 00:56:54,187
Okay.

1542
00:56:54,688 --> 00:56:56,856
I am hurt. I can't do this.

1543
00:56:58,591 --> 00:57:01,327
(He got scared, dizzy, and annoyed. He wants to quit.)

1544
00:57:01,327 --> 00:57:02,362
I'm dizzy.

1545
00:57:03,496 --> 00:57:05,298
There must be a box there.

1546
00:57:05,765 --> 00:57:07,200
Can you...

1547
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:11,071
- I was here before. - Hide well

1548
00:57:12,839 --> 00:57:15,508
I was here before.

1549
00:57:16,609 --> 00:57:20,046
I know how this works.

1550
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,449
I know the situation here.

1551
00:57:22,449 --> 00:57:26,219
Hide well, I can see your hair.

1552
00:57:26,219 --> 00:57:27,687
(She's got the hint box.)

1553
00:57:28,121 --> 00:57:30,990
(He saw the box, but he moves in the opposite direction.)

1554
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:32,525
My gosh.

1555
00:57:36,796 --> 00:57:40,200
(Take it if you dare.)

1556
00:57:41,601 --> 00:57:43,036
She's got the box.

1557
00:57:43,436 --> 00:57:46,806
Hide well, I can see your hair.

1558
00:57:46,806 --> 00:57:49,576
Please give it to me. It's my third try.

1559
00:57:49,976 --> 00:57:51,478
This is crazy.

1560
00:57:51,478 --> 00:57:53,747
(I can't go near her because she might pop out.)

1561
00:57:55,348 --> 00:58:00,587
(But he's a great strategist. He comes up with his first tactic.)

1562
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:08,628
(Laughing)

1563
00:58:11,698 --> 00:58:16,269
(He blocks her way, so she can't pop out.)

1564
00:58:16,269 --> 00:58:19,506
(Then he carefully tries to steal the box.)

1565
00:58:21,641 --> 00:58:28,248
(Will he finally be able to get the hint box on the fourth try?)

1566
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:33,920
(I see it, I block it, and I get it.)

1567
00:58:35,288 --> 00:58:36,456
I got it.

1568
00:58:38,591 --> 00:58:41,828
Find the hint box, and put the name of a person.

1569
00:58:41,828 --> 00:58:43,496
Then you will find out that person's identity.

1570
00:58:43,496 --> 00:58:44,798
(He can use the hint box to find a member's identity.)

1571
00:58:47,901 --> 00:58:49,936
Is Jae Seok a ghost?

1572
00:58:49,936 --> 00:58:53,840
(He asks if Jae Seok is a ghost.)

1573
00:58:57,076 --> 00:58:58,678
(He sighs.)

1574
00:58:59,746 --> 00:59:02,949
(Jae Seok is a ghost.)

1575
00:59:05,351 --> 00:59:08,888
(Jae Seok the Ghost is patrolling the security office.)

1576
00:59:08,888 --> 00:59:10,056
What is that?

1577
00:59:15,662 --> 00:59:17,931
(What's that?)

1578
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:19,966
I found it.

1579
00:59:19,966 --> 00:59:22,368
(He finds the pants.)

1580
00:59:23,436 --> 00:59:27,607
(He has never worn pants that weren't tight.)

1581
00:59:29,075 --> 00:59:32,812
(Putting it on is tough enough.)

1582
00:59:32,812 --> 00:59:33,947
My clothes are too thick.

1583
00:59:39,018 --> 00:59:41,187
Please help me, Kwon Ryeol.

1584
00:59:42,956 --> 00:59:44,257
My goodness.

1585
00:59:44,557 --> 00:59:46,426
Do you need help putting on your pants?

1586
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,461
Aren't we on the same team?

1587
00:59:48,962 --> 00:59:50,096
Are you...

1588
00:59:50,597 --> 00:59:51,831
I hear rumors that...

1589
00:59:51,831 --> 00:59:54,000
- you have a second job. - No.

1590
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,468
I heard you have a second job.

1591
00:59:55,468 --> 00:59:56,836
(Kwon Ryeol makes many mistakes.)

1592
00:59:56,836 --> 00:59:57,937
Gosh.

1593
00:59:59,105 --> 01:00:00,340
Are there any other pants?

1594
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:01,608
(He clears 1 out of 3.)

1595
01:00:01,608 --> 01:00:02,609
You win one.

1596
01:00:02,876 --> 01:00:04,177
- I got one, right? - Yes.

1597
01:00:04,878 --> 01:00:06,846
I can't keep them on. Others will recognize them.

1598
01:00:06,846 --> 01:00:07,947
You can take them off.

1599
01:00:08,548 --> 01:00:10,316
(What?)

1600
01:00:10,316 --> 01:00:11,818
Why did you tell me to put them on?

1601
01:00:14,287 --> 01:00:15,922
(Are there any other pants?)

1602
01:00:15,922 --> 01:00:17,056
Is there another pair?

1603
01:00:18,558 --> 01:00:19,626
What's this?

1604
01:00:21,027 --> 01:00:22,161
"Security Daily Log"?

1605
01:00:24,797 --> 01:00:28,468
(There are 3 security daily logs with R stickers.)

1606
01:00:28,801 --> 01:00:29,969
What's this?

1607
01:00:29,969 --> 01:00:31,437
(He opens 2015 security daily log.)

1608
01:00:34,007 --> 01:00:35,775
"They come back on the same day every year."

1609
01:00:36,276 --> 01:00:39,078
"Some are pathetic, and some are funny-looking."

1610
01:00:41,047 --> 01:00:42,515
"Why do they come back?"

1611
01:00:44,117 --> 01:00:47,320
(Is it about the ghosts who return every year?)

1612
01:00:48,888 --> 01:00:50,890
"Will they come back this year?"

1613
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:53,359
(Will they come back in 2017?)

1614
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:57,830
(Will they come back this year?)

1615
01:00:59,198 --> 01:01:04,037
(Haha follows a suspicious security guard ghost.)

1616
01:01:05,238 --> 01:01:08,007
Why do the ghosts have name tags?

1617
01:01:09,709 --> 01:01:12,445
(In the past, once you take off...)

1618
01:01:12,445 --> 01:01:15,148
(the ghosts' name tags, )

1619
01:01:15,648 --> 01:01:19,152
(you find important hints behind them.)

1620
01:01:20,086 --> 01:01:22,188
Will I be eliminated once I take off his name tag?

1621
01:01:22,188 --> 01:01:23,856
(What will happen...)

1622
01:01:23,856 --> 01:01:25,692
(once he takes off his name tag?)

1623
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:27,260
What's this?

1624
01:01:29,228 --> 01:01:30,596
(December 24, 2016)

1625
01:01:30,596 --> 01:01:31,831
"They're back again."

1626
01:01:31,831 --> 01:01:35,802
"Eight ghosts that we thought were made up by students."

1627
01:01:36,436 --> 01:01:37,470
"Eight ghosts"?

1628
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:44,377
(If there are 8 ghosts on December 24th...)

1629
01:01:44,377 --> 01:01:45,578
Today is the 24th.

1630
01:01:52,986 --> 01:01:54,487
We're eight members.

1631
01:01:55,888 --> 01:01:58,758
(If all members came back this day every year...)

1632
01:01:59,859 --> 01:02:01,361
(What's the secret behind the security guard's name tag?)

1633
01:02:01,361 --> 01:02:03,529
Will I be eliminated once I take off his name tag?

1634
01:02:03,529 --> 01:02:04,897
(What's the secret behind the security guard's name tag?)

1635
01:02:06,766 --> 01:02:12,238
(Human)

1636
01:02:13,306 --> 01:02:14,607
What was that about?

1637
01:02:14,607 --> 01:02:15,808
(Is the security guard human?)

1638
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:18,678
We're eight members.

1639
01:02:22,615 --> 01:02:23,716
Are all of us ghosts?

1640
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:29,455
(Are all 8 Running Man members ghosts?)

1641
01:02:30,556 --> 01:02:34,560
(At a peaceful school, )

1642
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:38,097
(8 ghosts started a story of ghosts.)

1643
01:02:38,097 --> 01:02:40,566
(As a matter of fact, )

1644
01:02:40,566 --> 01:02:43,036
(all the members were ghosts.)

1645
01:02:44,237 --> 01:02:49,142
(Jae Seok thought the student playing the piano was a ghost.)

1646
01:02:49,142 --> 01:02:52,812
(However, she's an ordinary student preparing to major in music.)

1647
01:02:53,279 --> 01:02:55,448
(When Jae Seok pressed the piano key, )

1648
01:02:55,448 --> 01:02:57,250
(she was shocked and ran out.)

1649
01:03:04,557 --> 01:03:10,696
(In the infirmary where Haha was looking for hints, )

1650
01:03:10,696 --> 01:03:15,668
(the ones who were lying down were students.)

1651
01:03:16,736 --> 01:03:20,406
(Due to Haha's movements, )

1652
01:03:20,406 --> 01:03:24,677
(rumors about infirmary ghosts spread widely.)

1653
01:03:31,951 --> 01:03:35,521
(To the classroom where students were calling ghosts, )

1654
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:40,226
(Ghost So Min entered.)

1655
01:03:41,627 --> 01:03:46,866
(I thought someone was calling for me.)

1656
01:03:51,437 --> 01:03:55,608
(8 ghosts who return every Christmas Eve)

1657
01:03:55,608 --> 01:03:59,979
(They were the Running Man members.)

1658
01:04:01,481 --> 01:04:06,819
(A bus arrives at the school before the opening.)

1659
01:04:10,456 --> 01:04:16,129
(There was no one on the bus.)

1660
01:04:19,999 --> 01:04:23,169
One ghost became human.

1661
01:04:23,569 --> 01:04:25,505
There's one more human being.

1662
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:30,109
(By taking off the name tag, Haha becomes human.)

1663
01:04:30,109 --> 01:04:31,210
That's amazing.

1664
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:33,212
(By taking off the name tag, Haha becomes human.)

1665
01:04:35,114 --> 01:04:36,549
I'm surprised.

1666
01:04:36,549 --> 01:04:37,750
(He's shocked.)

1667
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:38,851
Are we ghosts?

1668
01:04:38,951 --> 01:04:41,120
(All members are ghosts, )

1669
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:43,389
(and one of them became human.)

1670
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:50,129
(By keeping his identity a secret, )

1671
01:04:50,129 --> 01:04:52,165
(Haha is determined to remain human.)

1672
01:04:54,534 --> 01:04:55,701
Are you human?

1673
01:04:57,370 --> 01:04:58,571
Who are you?

1674
01:04:58,571 --> 01:04:59,572
(He speaks in a low voice.)

1675
01:04:59,872 --> 01:05:01,440
Someone became a human.

1676
01:05:02,475 --> 01:05:03,743
Who could it be?

1677
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:07,013
Who's the vengeful spirit, and who's human?

1678
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:08,281
What are you?

1679
01:05:08,481 --> 01:05:09,582
What?

1680
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:11,951
I'm a ghost.

1681
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,221
You need to get over your grudge.

1682
01:05:16,522 --> 01:05:19,659
(Haha seems suspicious.)

1683
01:05:20,693 --> 01:05:22,461
Where's mine?

1684
01:05:22,461 --> 01:05:25,431
(Jong Kook looks for his mission tool.)

1685
01:05:26,032 --> 01:05:28,100
(He enters the music classroom.)

1686
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:29,302
She must be cold.

1687
01:05:30,369 --> 01:05:33,573
Gosh, the student looks scary.

1688
01:05:34,774 --> 01:05:39,979
(Yes, I found fingernail polish.)

1689
01:05:45,251 --> 01:05:49,589
(He makes his nails pretty and colorful.)

1690
01:05:51,591 --> 01:05:54,160
I should leave so that she can stop playing the piano.

1691
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,062
(He uses 1 out of 5 colors.)

1692
01:05:57,563 --> 01:06:00,433
(Goodbye)

1693
01:06:01,801 --> 01:06:04,870
(She's embarrassed by how thoughtful he is.)

1694
01:06:05,705 --> 01:06:06,772
Hide-and-seek.

1695
01:06:06,772 --> 01:06:08,641
(He searches the hide-and-seek room.)

1696
01:06:08,641 --> 01:06:15,014
(Someone stares at Jong Kook.)

1697
01:06:18,251 --> 01:06:19,252
(While he's busy looking for hints...)

1698
01:06:19,252 --> 01:06:21,220
There are so many places to hide.

1699
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,823
(While he's busy looking for hints, )

1700
01:06:23,823 --> 01:06:28,094
(a mysterious being approaches Jong Kook.)

1701
01:06:29,295 --> 01:06:30,429
What?

1702
01:06:30,429 --> 01:06:31,464
(Tearing)

1703
01:06:32,231 --> 01:06:35,101
Ghost Jong Kook is eliminated.

1704
01:06:36,168 --> 01:06:41,674
(Did Jong Kook get eliminated?)

1705
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:48,581
(That means a vengeful spirit became active.)

1706
01:06:48,581 --> 01:06:49,749
There's a vengeful spirit.

1707
01:06:49,982 --> 01:06:51,083
There's a vengeful spirit.

1708
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:54,120
There's a vengeful spirit among you who's dangerous for ghosts.

1709
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:58,424
(Vengeful spirits become human by eliminating 2 ghosts.)

1710
01:06:59,859 --> 01:07:01,193
Was he a vengeful spirit?

1711
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:06,932
Who's a vengeful spirit who eliminated Jong Kook?

1712
01:07:07,099 --> 01:07:09,402
How can we eliminate the vengeful spirits?

1713
01:07:09,669 --> 01:07:11,470
We wait until they become human.

1714
01:07:11,804 --> 01:07:13,372
Until they become human?

1715
01:07:13,639 --> 01:07:15,841
He turns human once he eliminates one more.

1716
01:07:15,841 --> 01:07:17,943
(One more ghost must be sacrificed.)

1717
01:07:18,711 --> 01:07:20,079
- Ji Hyo. - Yes?

1718
01:07:20,212 --> 01:07:23,749
"You died in your sleep."

1719
01:07:23,949 --> 01:07:26,519
"You're the ghost of the sleeping classroom."

1720
01:07:27,053 --> 01:07:29,689
"When one of the members kisses..."

1721
01:07:30,022 --> 01:07:33,192
"the back of your hand, you're reborn as human."

1722
01:07:33,993 --> 01:07:35,861
A kiss on the back of my hand?

1723
01:07:36,529 --> 01:07:38,864
Can I put my hand on someone's lips?

1724
01:07:38,864 --> 01:07:40,700
(She must get a kiss on the back of her hand.)

1725
01:07:41,434 --> 01:07:44,070
(Before she's eliminated by a vengeful spirit, )

1726
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:46,739
(she must clear the mission and become human.)

1727
01:07:46,939 --> 01:07:48,074
Look, Seok Jin.

1728
01:07:48,074 --> 01:07:49,141
I don't want to.

1729
01:07:49,141 --> 01:07:50,209
(He's suspicious.)

1730
01:07:50,209 --> 01:07:51,344
I know that it's your mission.

1731
01:07:51,344 --> 01:07:52,445
(It's obviously a mission.)

1732
01:07:52,445 --> 01:07:54,480
It's obviously a mission.

1733
01:07:55,314 --> 01:07:56,349
(Was that too obvious?)

1734
01:07:56,349 --> 01:07:57,450
Gosh.

1735
01:07:59,552 --> 01:08:02,221
Why do you keep one hand bare?

1736
01:08:02,655 --> 01:08:07,560
(Everyone, I'm about to start a secret mission.)

1737
01:08:08,094 --> 01:08:09,628
Why don't you ask me?

1738
01:08:10,029 --> 01:08:12,231
Haha, please do it once.

1739
01:08:12,331 --> 01:08:15,601
- What? Hold on. - Please do me a favor.

1740
01:08:16,168 --> 01:08:18,704
- What did you say? - Do me a favor.

1741
01:08:18,704 --> 01:08:20,039
(Come on, aren't we friends?)

1742
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:23,909
Have I ever been so desperate?

1743
01:08:25,411 --> 01:08:27,680
- Wait a little. - Gosh.

1744
01:08:29,181 --> 01:08:31,450
(The members get more curious...)

1745
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:33,719
(about humans and vengeful spirits.)

1746
01:08:38,124 --> 01:08:39,658
You startled me.

1747
01:08:39,658 --> 01:08:41,460
(Jae Seok crosses paths with Haha.)

1748
01:08:41,961 --> 01:08:43,129
Are you a ghost?

1749
01:08:43,629 --> 01:08:44,764
Yes, I am.

1750
01:08:45,464 --> 01:08:48,434
(Are you sure you're a ghost?)

1751
01:08:49,568 --> 01:08:51,170
(10 minutes ago)

1752
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:52,304
Goodness.

1753
01:08:56,142 --> 01:08:57,309
It's Haha.

1754
01:08:57,309 --> 01:08:59,512
(After finding a hint box, )

1755
01:08:59,512 --> 01:09:01,680
(Jae Seok asks Haha's identity.)

1756
01:09:02,615 --> 01:09:04,383
(Haha is human.)

1757
01:09:06,352 --> 01:09:07,920
(Don't lie to me.)

1758
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,021
Stop it.

1759
01:09:09,522 --> 01:09:10,890
You're human, aren't you?

1760
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:13,058
(I'll take off your name tag.)

1761
01:09:13,058 --> 01:09:14,794
- You're human, aren't you? - No.

1762
01:09:14,794 --> 01:09:16,061
- You are. - I'm not.

1763
01:09:16,061 --> 01:09:17,630
- You're human. - I'm not.

1764
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:18,731
Aren't you?

1765
01:09:18,864 --> 01:09:20,599
(Jae Seok becomes human...)

1766
01:09:20,599 --> 01:09:22,868
(as Haha turns back into a ghost.)

1767
01:09:22,868 --> 01:09:25,971
I worked so hard to become human.

1768
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:27,473
A ghost...

1769
01:09:27,973 --> 01:09:29,542
should remain as a ghost.

1770
01:09:30,309 --> 01:09:33,412
How dare you try to become human alone?

1771
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,283
Get lost. Wait, am I human now?

1772
01:09:37,283 --> 01:09:39,718
You became human while he became a ghost.

1773
01:09:42,421 --> 01:09:46,125
(He walks around to celebrate becoming human.)

1774
01:09:48,661 --> 01:09:51,764
(What are you doing, Kwang Soo and So Min?)

1775
01:09:52,531 --> 01:09:55,434
(We are...)

1776
01:09:55,434 --> 01:09:57,803
(doing...)

1777
01:09:58,871 --> 01:10:00,873
(Ripping)

1778
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:04,510
Human Yu Jae Seok is out.

1779
01:10:07,379 --> 01:10:09,381
(He just became human and is out?)

1780
01:10:09,381 --> 01:10:10,549
What?

1781
01:10:12,651 --> 01:10:15,321
He was a ghost but became human. He's out now.

1782
01:10:16,422 --> 01:10:18,424
Jae Seok was human?

1783
01:10:18,691 --> 01:10:20,759
- How is Jae Seok out? - Where's So Min?

1784
01:10:21,494 --> 01:10:23,362
- Was it the two of you? - Yes.

1785
01:10:23,362 --> 01:10:25,064
Then it's either of these.

1786
01:10:25,264 --> 01:10:27,900
- Kwang Soo got him out, - I got Jae Seok out?

1787
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:30,002
Or So Min did. It's either of those.

1788
01:10:30,002 --> 01:10:31,971
(Only humans can eliminate humans, so it's one of them.)

1789
01:10:32,872 --> 01:10:35,374
- Where is she? - Down there. So Min is there.

1790
01:10:36,742 --> 01:10:38,410
One of them is human.

1791
01:10:39,778 --> 01:10:42,781
- It's more likely Kwang Soo did it. - That's right.

1792
01:10:43,649 --> 01:10:46,619
Jae Seok, Kwang Soo, and So Min were together.

1793
01:10:47,553 --> 01:10:49,788
- 1 of these 2 are human then. - That's right.

1794
01:10:50,689 --> 01:10:52,691
- It's right. - True.

1795
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:56,729
There is a vengeful spirit here too.

1796
01:10:56,729 --> 01:10:58,531
- Of course. - There has to be.

1797
01:10:59,431 --> 01:11:00,633
Hold on.

1798
01:11:00,633 --> 01:11:04,803
(Who's the vengeful spirit that eliminated Jong Kook?)

1799
01:11:04,803 --> 01:11:06,839
If the spirit gets another ghost out...

1800
01:11:06,839 --> 01:11:09,174
- They'll become human. - They become human.

1801
01:11:09,441 --> 01:11:12,711
If there are no ghosts left, they can't become human.

1802
01:11:13,779 --> 01:11:15,080
- That's right. - That's right.

1803
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,949
One of us must be feeling impatient.

1804
01:11:16,949 --> 01:11:18,751
(If there are no ghosts left, the spirit can't become human.)

1805
01:11:18,951 --> 01:11:20,352
(Before all ghosts turn into humans, they have to eliminate a ghost.)

1806
01:11:20,352 --> 01:11:21,820
How did they become human?

1807
01:11:21,954 --> 01:11:23,822
- What are you? - I'm a ghost.

1808
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:26,592
- You're not human yet. - Not yet.

1809
01:11:26,592 --> 01:11:27,860
- Didn't you do a mission yet? - No.

1810
01:11:28,961 --> 01:11:30,262
Do you have to eat?

1811
01:11:30,262 --> 01:11:32,064
- I have to eat. - I stole your food. Are you out?

1812
01:11:32,464 --> 01:11:34,833
I'm not, but I failed. I have to eat again.

1813
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:38,504
(He has to eat in secret, but he couldn't do it yet.)

1814
01:11:40,139 --> 01:11:41,941
There are no lunch boxes. I have to find it.

1815
01:11:41,941 --> 01:11:43,242
- There was one over there. - Where?

1816
01:11:43,242 --> 01:11:44,510
- Over there. - Let's check it out.

1817
01:11:45,811 --> 01:11:47,179
(Ripping)

1818
01:11:49,081 --> 01:11:53,319
(Se Chan rips Seok Jin's name tag.)

1819
01:11:53,319 --> 01:11:55,921
(What happened?)

1820
01:11:57,590 --> 01:12:00,059
"You're a vengeful spirit who died namelessly..."

1821
01:12:00,059 --> 01:12:02,394
"because people didn't recognize your existence."

1822
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:08,601
- Why do you keep staring at me? - You're going that far?

1823
01:12:08,601 --> 01:12:14,540
(It was his mission to eliminate Jong Kook.)

1824
01:12:16,609 --> 01:12:20,212
(He got 2 ghosts out, so he's reborn as human.)

1825
01:12:20,212 --> 01:12:21,380
Human.

1826
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:23,182
Humans can get other humans out.

1827
01:12:23,182 --> 01:12:24,950
(He got 2 ghosts out, so he's reborn as human.)

1828
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:29,421
Hold on so...

1829
01:12:29,722 --> 01:12:31,490
At this rate,

1830
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:33,192
I can escalate this into a war.

1831
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:37,329
If one person survives and stands on the platform...

1832
01:12:37,463 --> 01:12:41,100
that only humans can when a rooster crows at dawn, that person wins.

1833
01:12:42,635 --> 01:12:43,769
What's going on?

1834
01:12:43,769 --> 01:12:45,270
(Ji Hyo bumps into Kwang Soo and So Min.)

1835
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:46,639
What's going on with you two?

1836
01:12:48,741 --> 01:12:49,908
Are you human?

1837
01:12:49,908 --> 01:12:50,909
(He's being creepy.)

1838
01:12:51,443 --> 01:12:53,612
- Kwang Soo, wait. - Kwang Soo.

1839
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,482
(She appeared out of nowhere and did her mission.)

1840
01:12:56,482 --> 01:12:57,483
What was that?

1841
01:12:58,283 --> 01:12:59,618
- What was that? - What was that?

1842
01:12:59,618 --> 01:13:00,853
(I remember that.)

1843
01:13:00,853 --> 01:13:02,421
I got it.

1844
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:05,991
She's human now.

1845
01:13:05,991 --> 01:13:06,992
Let's check.

1846
01:13:07,259 --> 01:13:08,293
Oh, dear.

1847
01:13:08,293 --> 01:13:09,461
(Let me see your name tag.)

1848
01:13:09,461 --> 01:13:10,529
Hey.

1849
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:12,431
Goodness.

1850
01:13:13,799 --> 01:13:15,801
(Ripping)

1851
01:13:17,069 --> 01:13:19,004
(I'm sorry, but I love you.)

1852
01:13:20,339 --> 01:13:23,709
(Earlier with Jae Seok, )

1853
01:13:23,709 --> 01:13:29,648
(So Min got him out with a surprise move.)

1854
01:13:29,648 --> 01:13:30,749
Jae Seok is out.

1855
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:32,651
(So Min is human who completed her mission early.)

1856
01:13:32,651 --> 01:13:34,253
What are you?

1857
01:13:34,253 --> 01:13:35,721
(So Min is human who completed her mission early.)

1858
01:13:37,222 --> 01:13:40,092
Human Song Ji Hyo is out.

1859
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,629
If the security guard was human,

1860
01:13:44,363 --> 01:13:47,900
I can get other humans out...

1861
01:13:48,834 --> 01:13:50,169
and become human again.

1862
01:13:50,169 --> 01:13:52,371
(Would he become human if he eliminates a student?)

1863
01:13:54,039 --> 01:13:57,042
(He approaches a student...)

1864
01:13:57,042 --> 01:13:59,445
(and rips her name tag.)

1865
01:13:59,445 --> 01:14:00,479
(Human)

1866
01:14:00,579 --> 01:14:02,681
(Haha is human now.)

1867
01:14:02,681 --> 01:14:03,982
I was right.

1868
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:06,618
- Se Chan. - Yes, Haha.

1869
01:14:06,819 --> 01:14:08,954
- Listen to me. - Okay.

1870
01:14:10,089 --> 01:14:12,858
This is war.

1871
01:14:16,061 --> 01:14:18,764
Look. They're talking.

1872
01:14:18,831 --> 01:14:21,200
- We're all humans. - Right. There's none left.

1873
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,901
Se Chan is human too.

1874
01:14:23,769 --> 01:14:25,704
If you say you're human, they'll get you out right away.

1875
01:14:27,539 --> 01:14:29,374
(They form an alliance.)

1876
01:14:30,109 --> 01:14:31,410
Those two.

1877
01:14:32,244 --> 01:14:33,779
They'll get you out.

1878
01:14:33,979 --> 01:14:35,581
We have to work together.

1879
01:14:35,681 --> 01:14:37,082
- Did they form an alliance? - Yes.

1880
01:14:40,452 --> 01:14:44,089
(Kwang Soo hit my head earlier.)

1881
01:14:44,089 --> 01:14:48,560
(That must have been his mission.)

1882
01:14:48,961 --> 01:14:54,199
(He must be done with his mission then.)

1883
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,870
(You should donate your name tag.)

1884
01:14:58,103 --> 01:15:01,140
Come. We have to work together. Let's work together.

1885
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:03,408
We have to work together. Trust me.

1886
01:15:04,109 --> 01:15:05,410
Trust me. I'm serious.

1887
01:15:05,611 --> 01:15:06,779
(Se Chan and Haha are a team.)

1888
01:15:06,779 --> 01:15:08,480
Think carefully.

1889
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:09,748
(Kwang Soo and So Min are another team.)

1890
01:15:09,748 --> 01:15:11,950
- It's the four of us left. - Right.

1891
01:15:13,619 --> 01:15:19,091
There are only humans left. Why are you hesitating?

1892
01:15:22,394 --> 01:15:23,462
Exactly.

1893
01:15:23,462 --> 01:15:25,063
(They have to go head-to-head now.)

1894
01:15:25,063 --> 01:15:26,198
Come on.

1895
01:15:26,732 --> 01:15:27,933
(She backs off.)

1896
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,868
You can't be out.

1897
01:15:29,868 --> 01:15:30,903
(There are two guys on the other side.)

1898
01:15:32,371 --> 01:15:35,073
(We're all humans.)

1899
01:15:35,741 --> 01:15:37,543
I'll hold them. You rip the name tag.

1900
01:15:37,543 --> 01:15:39,711
(This is their joint plan.)

1901
01:15:39,711 --> 01:15:40,879
That's the only way.

1902
01:15:41,013 --> 01:15:43,849
That's cunning. He's going to rip mine later.

1903
01:15:43,849 --> 01:15:44,983
What are you talking about?

1904
01:15:45,484 --> 01:15:47,052
- He's going to get me out. - What are you talking about?

1905
01:15:47,052 --> 01:15:49,621
Whom am I to trust right now?

1906
01:15:49,621 --> 01:15:51,423
If one person goes on the platform, this is over.

1907
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,691
- I know. - It'll be over.

1908
01:15:52,691 --> 01:15:55,460
You're going to get me out and go on the platform.

1909
01:15:55,761 --> 01:15:57,930
- It's so obvious. - That doesn't make sense.

1910
01:15:57,930 --> 01:15:59,231
(I can't trust you.)

1911
01:15:59,798 --> 01:16:00,933
Do you have a good idea?

1912
01:16:00,933 --> 01:16:03,101
(Haha and Se Chan's best strategy is...)

1913
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:06,471
If So Min gets eliminated by Kwang Soo...

1914
01:16:06,471 --> 01:16:09,842
(It's best if we make them fight.)

1915
01:16:09,942 --> 01:16:11,710
We have to think carefully.

1916
01:16:14,179 --> 01:16:15,380
Will we do this together...

1917
01:16:16,281 --> 01:16:18,450
We have to. There are two of them.

1918
01:16:18,684 --> 01:16:19,751
It has to be 2 on 2.

1919
01:16:19,751 --> 01:16:22,554
One of them can betray the other.

1920
01:16:24,389 --> 01:16:27,693
I'll betray you.

1921
01:16:29,461 --> 01:16:30,929
(Se Chan...)

1922
01:16:30,929 --> 01:16:32,264
(removes Haha's name tag.)

1923
01:16:32,264 --> 01:16:33,432
I'll betray you.

1924
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:37,769
(Their alliance is broken first.)

1925
01:16:37,769 --> 01:16:38,871
I'm going to do this by myself.

1926
01:16:38,871 --> 01:16:41,440
How dare you?

1927
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:44,309
(Haha is out.)

1928
01:16:45,143 --> 01:16:48,981
Human Haha is out.

1929
01:16:50,382 --> 01:16:51,750
Se Chan got him out.

1930
01:16:52,551 --> 01:16:55,120
(There's Kwang Soo, Se Chan, and So Min left.)

1931
01:16:56,021 --> 01:16:57,789
(At that moment)

1932
01:16:58,190 --> 01:17:00,058
The rooster crowed.

1933
01:17:00,359 --> 01:17:02,261
The rooster crowed.

1934
01:17:02,861 --> 01:17:08,100
One human can go on the platform in the schoolyard.

1935
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,501
(There's the platform to decide who will win.)

1936
01:17:09,501 --> 01:17:10,969
(They head to the platform.)

1937
01:17:10,969 --> 01:17:12,004
Go.

1938
01:17:13,639 --> 01:17:19,211
(It's Se Chan versus Kwang Soo and So Min.)

1939
01:17:19,411 --> 01:17:24,883
(You have to get other humans out and stand on the platform.)

1940
01:17:26,151 --> 01:17:27,819
(It's the showdown.)

1941
01:17:27,819 --> 01:17:29,821
- Rip his name tag, So Min. - Hurry.

1942
01:17:30,088 --> 01:17:32,591
If I help them, they'll rip my name tag.

1943
01:17:32,591 --> 01:17:34,259
(If I get Se Chan out, Kwang Soo will rip my name tag.)

1944
01:17:34,259 --> 01:17:35,460
Hurry, So Min.

1945
01:17:37,729 --> 01:17:39,798
(So Min stops hesitating and joins him.)

1946
01:17:39,798 --> 01:17:42,901
(Se Chan is outnumbered.)

1947
01:17:43,802 --> 01:17:45,871
Why, So Min? Let's do this together.

1948
01:17:46,738 --> 01:17:50,609
(He sways So Min...)

1949
01:17:50,609 --> 01:17:52,911
(and rips her name tag.)

1950
01:17:52,911 --> 01:17:53,979
What happened?

1951
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:55,480
(She can't help but laugh.)

1952
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,548
What happened?

1953
01:17:57,950 --> 01:18:00,052
(Se Chan versus Kwang Soo)

1954
01:18:00,152 --> 01:18:01,853
(If I get Kwang Soo out, )

1955
01:18:01,853 --> 01:18:04,423
(I win.)

1956
01:18:04,423 --> 01:18:06,892
(Grabbing)

1957
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:09,628
(Ripping)

1958
01:18:12,030 --> 01:18:13,999
(As soon as he gets his name tag ripped, )

1959
01:18:13,999 --> 01:18:17,302
(Kwang Soo runs to the platform.)

1960
01:18:19,271 --> 01:18:20,272
Kwang Soo...

1961
01:18:20,539 --> 01:18:21,540
wins.

1962
01:18:24,209 --> 01:18:25,410
Is he a ghost?

1963
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:26,611
(What?)

1964
01:18:26,878 --> 01:18:28,280
(Ghost)

1965
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:32,084
(The whole thing was a part of Kwang Soo's plan.)

1966
01:18:32,084 --> 01:18:35,220
"You're a ghost who died from getting backstabbed."

1967
01:18:36,121 --> 01:18:38,490
"Find toy hammers hidden inside the school,"

1968
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:40,559
"and hit 4 Running Man members' heads..."

1969
01:18:40,659 --> 01:18:42,160
"to be reborn as human."

1970
01:18:43,762 --> 01:18:46,498
There's no reason for humans to eliminate ghosts,

1971
01:18:46,498 --> 01:18:48,633
and ghosts are out if they eliminate other ghosts,

1972
01:18:48,633 --> 01:18:50,469
so I'll do the mission slowly.

1973
01:18:51,069 --> 01:18:52,604
I'll find the toy hammer...

1974
01:18:53,171 --> 01:18:54,439
and hit three members.

1975
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:56,742
I'll hit the last one later.

1976
01:18:56,742 --> 01:18:58,410
(I'll finish my mission late.)

1977
01:18:59,678 --> 01:19:04,950
(He hit Se Chan's head but still stayed as a ghost.)

1978
01:19:06,251 --> 01:19:08,220
(In front of the members, )

1979
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:12,891
(he pretended to be human.)

1980
01:19:13,792 --> 01:19:15,360
(You're human.)

1981
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:18,764
(He tricked Se Chan, and his plan worked.)

1982
01:19:20,232 --> 01:19:22,501
(He tricked me.)

1983
01:19:23,869 --> 01:19:26,938
(He became human and stood on the platform at the end.)

1984
01:19:27,739 --> 01:19:30,208
Kwang Soo, you won, so you get a box of sweet potatoes...

1985
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:33,311
and another gift you want from the pile.

1986
01:19:33,311 --> 01:19:35,580
I pick coffee maker.

1987
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:37,449
(He picks a coffeemaker.)

1988
01:19:37,449 --> 01:19:38,583
Thank you.

1989
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:40,252
(His hands are full.)

1990
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:42,254
(He's envious.)

1991
01:19:42,454 --> 01:19:44,623
Viewers, Merry Christmas.

1992
01:19:44,623 --> 01:19:47,659
- Merry Christmas. - Have a merry Christmas.

1993
01:19:47,659 --> 01:19:49,194
(Have a merry Christmas!)

1994
01:19:49,761 --> 01:19:51,263
(Next week)

1995
01:19:51,963 --> 01:19:54,800
(The idol group that represents the nation, Sechs Kies)

1996
01:19:56,501 --> 01:19:58,770
(The rising star in variety shows, Lee Elijah)

1997
01:19:59,171 --> 01:20:00,772
(The number 1 healthy beauty, Soyou)

1998
01:20:01,573 --> 01:20:04,810
(It's winter training for variety shows.)

1999
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:07,179
(However, )

2000
01:20:07,379 --> 01:20:09,981
(a snowstorm suddenly hits them.)

2001
01:20:10,282 --> 01:20:12,250
(Welcome to the winter kingdom.)

2002
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:14,453
(Something is strange about this winter kingdom.)

2003
01:20:14,453 --> 01:20:16,721
(Their bodies become paralyzed.)

2004
01:20:16,721 --> 01:20:19,891
(The competition for survival in the winter kingdom starts.)

2005
01:20:19,891 --> 01:20:23,128
(Their only chance of survival lies in finding the flame.)

2006
01:20:23,128 --> 01:20:25,730
(If you want to live, find the flame.)

2007
01:20:26,198 --> 01:20:28,200
(Where is the flame? Give it to me!)

2008
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,069
(Without the flame, everyone will become ice zombies.)

2009
01:20:31,069 --> 01:20:33,572
(Who is destined to survive in the ruthless winter kingdom?)

2010
01:20:34,339 --> 01:20:36,141
Why did you touch my chest?

2011
01:20:36,241 --> 01:20:38,710
(Winter Kingdom Survival)
