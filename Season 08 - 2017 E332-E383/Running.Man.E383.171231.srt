1
00:00:06,088 --> 00:00:08,018
(The winter festival of the world, )

2
00:00:08,018 --> 00:00:11,318
(2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics)

3
00:00:11,318 --> 00:00:13,988
(The members begin their field training for the games.)

4
00:00:13,988 --> 00:00:15,227
(However, )

5
00:00:15,227 --> 00:00:17,358
(the biggest cold wave hits Korea.)

6
00:00:17,358 --> 00:00:18,767
(Running Man's winter games...)

7
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:20,797
(may seem slightly simple and nasty, )

8
00:00:20,797 --> 00:00:22,867
(but they play games of loyalty.)

9
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:25,538
(What are the missions they will play at the end of 2017?)

10
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:31,237
- Hello. - Hi.

11
00:00:31,237 --> 00:00:32,907
- Hi. - Hello.

12
00:00:33,608 --> 00:00:35,718
- It's really winter. It's cold. - It's freezing.

13
00:00:35,718 --> 00:00:37,477
- It's so cold. - It's freezing cold.

14
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:40,487
- Seriously. - But I don't see the ladies.

15
00:00:40,617 --> 00:00:42,157
I bet we are having female guests today.

16
00:00:42,157 --> 00:00:43,858
Is So Min going to be a spy again? Is she a spy?

17
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,328
- Kwang Soo, when I saw you earlier, - Yes?

18
00:00:46,388 --> 00:00:48,697
The light reflected on your jacket. It almost fooled me.

19
00:00:48,697 --> 00:00:50,898
- What do you mean? - I thought it was a fly.

20
00:00:50,898 --> 00:00:52,998
(His jacket is sleek like his bottom.)

21
00:00:52,998 --> 00:00:54,367
- What are you talking about? - That does look like a fly.

22
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:55,797
- It's khaki. - I can see that,

23
00:00:55,797 --> 00:00:58,068
- Kwang Soo, rub your hands. - but the light reflected on it.

24
00:00:58,068 --> 00:00:59,407
- Do it. - Come on. Just do it for us.

25
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:00,438
Why would I rub my hands?

26
00:01:00,438 --> 00:01:02,108
- Don't dress up only for dramas. - Hey, do it here.

27
00:01:02,108 --> 00:01:04,078
- Unbelievable. - Kwang Soo, just copy me.

28
00:01:04,078 --> 00:01:05,608
- My gosh. - Dress up for variety shows too.

29
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:07,377
- I've never heard that before. - Wait.

30
00:01:07,707 --> 00:01:09,118
When the sun reflected, I really thought he was a fly.

31
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:10,418
How could you mistake me for it?

32
00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:11,547
(He's treated like a fly.)

33
00:01:11,547 --> 00:01:15,257
I can see that everyone tried to look presentable including Se Chan.

34
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:17,517
Don't you think my outfits look quite nice these days?

35
00:01:17,517 --> 00:01:19,728
- Sure. They improved a lot. - They improved a lot.

36
00:01:19,728 --> 00:01:21,188
- Right? - "Y".

37
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:22,998
- It stands for "Yang". - Actually, I...

38
00:01:22,998 --> 00:01:24,498
- I was shocked. - What do you mean?

39
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:26,397
It happened on the elevators. Many neighbors are fans of the show.

40
00:01:26,397 --> 00:01:29,198
We even shot an episode at my house. A kid...

41
00:01:29,237 --> 00:01:31,067
told me that he enjoyed watching the show.

42
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:34,368
He asked me why my outfits looked ugly.

43
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:36,407
(A kid asked him why his outfits looked ugly.)

44
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:38,138
- A kid asked you that? - Yes, I was surprised.

45
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:40,608
- Not everyone has nice outfits. - So I asked...

46
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,918
if mine looked the ugliest, but it wasn't.

47
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:44,718
- Who had the ugliest outfit? - He picked Jong Kook's.

48
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:46,517
(Jong Kook's outfits are the ugliest.)

49
00:01:46,517 --> 00:01:49,817
- He said Jong Kook's is the same. - Well, it's just that...

50
00:01:49,817 --> 00:01:51,718
Jong Kook, it's such a waste of money.

51
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:53,427
- Jae Seok. - I...

52
00:01:53,427 --> 00:01:57,157
I was shooting a show yesterday,

53
00:01:57,157 --> 00:01:59,998
but I had some spare time, so I went shopping there.

54
00:02:00,097 --> 00:02:01,968
- I bought it since it was warm, - So what we mean is that...

55
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:03,097
but you know what's surprising?

56
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:04,897
They forgot to remove the security tag.

57
00:02:04,897 --> 00:02:06,368
- Seriously? - Yes.

58
00:02:06,808 --> 00:02:09,338
(The security tag is still on as if he had stolen the vest.)

59
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,308
- They didn't take it off? - I...

60
00:02:11,308 --> 00:02:14,107
- Someone might think I stole it. - Hey!

61
00:02:14,107 --> 00:02:15,377
- Hey. - What if people think I'm a thief?

62
00:02:15,377 --> 00:02:16,917
Hey, Jong Kook. How could you...

63
00:02:17,248 --> 00:02:19,188
- Jae Seok. - You know that you shouldn't steal.

64
00:02:19,188 --> 00:02:21,287
- You even dressed up like a thief. - I bought it in Ilsan.

65
00:02:21,287 --> 00:02:24,287
I announced it on TV. I didn't steal this vest.

66
00:02:24,558 --> 00:02:25,558
I paid for this.

67
00:02:25,558 --> 00:02:26,727
(Don't think I stole it!)

68
00:02:27,257 --> 00:02:28,428
- Everyone. - Yes?

69
00:02:28,428 --> 00:02:32,768
The day after this episode airs, it will be January 1.

70
00:02:32,768 --> 00:02:34,528
- Really? - It will be New Year's Day.

71
00:02:34,528 --> 00:02:38,868
In celebration of Pyeongchang Winter Olympics which will be held soon,

72
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:42,308
you will depart for the field training with us.

73
00:02:42,308 --> 00:02:46,148
(Members of Running Man will leave for the training as well!)

74
00:02:46,148 --> 00:02:47,808
- Field training? - Why would we?

75
00:02:47,808 --> 00:02:50,648
- New Year and that aren't related. - We aren't athletes.

76
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:53,148
Why would we go on training? We aren't athletes.

77
00:02:53,148 --> 00:02:55,317
Guests including So Min and Ji Hyo...

78
00:02:55,657 --> 00:02:57,988
who will join you on the training...

79
00:02:57,988 --> 00:03:00,657
are on the train bound for Pyeongchang.

80
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:03,298
- They are in 3 different carts. - 3 carts?

81
00:03:03,298 --> 00:03:04,357
(2 teams of guests are waiting.)

82
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:07,597
2 sisters of Running Man take up 1 cart.

83
00:03:08,227 --> 00:03:10,697
- Female guests take up another. - Okay!

84
00:03:10,697 --> 00:03:13,907
And male guests take up the other coach.

85
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:14,907
No, not them.

86
00:03:15,338 --> 00:03:16,338
I already feel uncomfortable.

87
00:03:16,338 --> 00:03:17,708
- I already feel uneasy. - So...

88
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,977
- the best pair is the female pair. - Exactly.

89
00:03:19,977 --> 00:03:21,248
I wonder who will pick them.

90
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:22,548
There are two female guests.

91
00:03:22,548 --> 00:03:25,148
- Partner up with another member. - I'm serious about this.

92
00:03:25,317 --> 00:03:27,287
Make a pair, and choose a coach.

93
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:29,887
Then you will make a team with the guests in the coach you've chosen.

94
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:31,558
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Yes, let's do that.

95
00:03:31,857 --> 00:03:33,458
Those who play the same hand are a team.

96
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,157
- All right. - Rock-paper-scissors.

97
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:38,827
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo play scissors.)

98
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:40,428
- The two of you played scissors. - You are a team.

99
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,398
- Let's do it again. - Why are you ignoring each other?

100
00:03:42,398 --> 00:03:43,898
- The two of you are a team. - Why are you ignoring each other?

101
00:03:43,898 --> 00:03:45,137
The two of you are a team.

102
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:46,407
- Front or back - Front or back.

103
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:50,208
(Jong Kook and Haha, Jae Seok and Se Chan are teams.)

104
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,377
- My goodness. - This is good.

105
00:03:51,377 --> 00:03:53,208
The ones with protruding mouths became a team.

106
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:56,118
- Both of us have protruding mouths. - We are a team.

107
00:03:56,118 --> 00:03:57,278
Team Ugly.

108
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,718
Speak for yourself.

109
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,988
(The partners are set.)

110
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:03,188
- Let's go. - Let's go.

111
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:04,588
- Let's go. - Let's go.

112
00:04:04,588 --> 00:04:06,058
Okay. I am serious.

113
00:04:06,058 --> 00:04:08,088
- The middle one will be the best. - Let's choose the middle one.

114
00:04:08,088 --> 00:04:10,498
I want the coach with So Min and Ji Hyo.

115
00:04:10,498 --> 00:04:11,968
It's a train to Gangneung.

116
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:15,368
- It goes to Pyeongchang. - It only takes an hour and half.

117
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:18,567
An hour and half? That's fast.

118
00:04:18,637 --> 00:04:20,308
- Let's choose the middle one. - Coach number four.

119
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:21,608
- Okay. - Coach number four?

120
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,377
- Shall we go? - Let's board the train.

121
00:04:23,377 --> 00:04:27,077
(Which team awaits them?)

122
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:30,017
(In the three coaches are Team Ji Hyo and So Min, )

123
00:04:30,017 --> 00:04:32,748
(Team Female Guests, )

124
00:04:32,748 --> 00:04:38,527
(and Team Male Guests.)

125
00:04:39,228 --> 00:04:42,897
(We want Team Female Guests.)

126
00:04:42,897 --> 00:04:44,457
Hold on. For goodness' sake.

127
00:04:44,457 --> 00:04:45,567
Did we pick the wrong one?

128
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:50,238
This is upsetting.

129
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:53,168
- I can already tell who they are. - For goodness' sake.

130
00:04:53,337 --> 00:04:55,738
The beanie gives away her identity.

131
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:58,678
The guests wouldn't wear that kind of a beanie.

132
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:01,647
- The guests would go to a salon. - Seriously.

133
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:02,748
I knew it.

134
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:04,048
This is upsetting.

135
00:05:04,217 --> 00:05:05,848
- Hello. - Hello, Haha.

136
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,887
- Hello, Haha. - Hello.

137
00:05:08,457 --> 00:05:09,618
Let's work hard today.

138
00:05:09,618 --> 00:05:10,887
(Jong Kook, Haha, Ji Hyo, and So Min form a team.)

139
00:05:11,118 --> 00:05:12,858
- Why don't we take the front? - Let's do that.

140
00:05:12,957 --> 00:05:14,127
Let's take the front.

141
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:16,058
- Which coach is left? - The middle one.

142
00:05:16,158 --> 00:05:17,627
- Okay. Coach number six. - We pick coach number five.

143
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:18,767
- It's the middle one. - Let's go.

144
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:20,527
(Team Female Guests and Team Male Guests remain.)

145
00:05:20,527 --> 00:05:22,538
- Let's see. - Let's see.

146
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:24,267
(They have a 50-percent chance of meeting Team Female Guests.)

147
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:25,538
I don't think this is the right coach.

148
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:27,608
(They have a 50-percent chance of meeting Team Female Guests.)

149
00:05:28,337 --> 00:05:29,608
(Which coach are they in?)

150
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:30,808
Is it this one?

151
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:32,478
(Which coach are they in?)

152
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:34,048
Are they men or women?

153
00:05:34,048 --> 00:05:36,217
I think they are women.

154
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:40,387
- They are women. - We picked the right coach!

155
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:44,387
(My goodness, there are women.)

156
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:45,558
They are women.

157
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:47,488
- They are the guests. - They are the guests.

158
00:05:48,127 --> 00:05:50,527
- I can tell from the back... - They are the guests.

159
00:05:50,527 --> 00:05:52,467
That they are the guests.

160
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:54,168
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo are excited to meet the female guests.)

161
00:05:55,337 --> 00:05:57,238
I think we chose the wrong coach.

162
00:05:57,967 --> 00:05:59,137
There are too many people.

163
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:01,408
- Why are there too many people? - Aren't there two female guests?

164
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:03,038
We chose the wrong coach.

165
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:04,377
(There are 5 men with broad backs.)

166
00:06:04,377 --> 00:06:06,678
The right choice is always the opposite of your choice.

167
00:06:06,848 --> 00:06:09,017
Their hats look gloomy.

168
00:06:09,748 --> 00:06:11,577
Look at those hats.

169
00:06:11,717 --> 00:06:13,848
They look old.

170
00:06:14,048 --> 00:06:15,158
Who are they?

171
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:16,257
Honey.

172
00:06:16,257 --> 00:06:18,558
(Honey.)

173
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:19,788
Honey.

174
00:06:19,788 --> 00:06:21,798
(The one who calls him "Honey" in a gravelly voice is...)

175
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,498
(Sechs Kies.)

176
00:06:24,498 --> 00:06:26,928
- It's Sechs Kies. - Honey.

177
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,598
(Honey, you are late.)

178
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:30,738
- For goodness' sake. - Hello.

179
00:06:31,197 --> 00:06:32,868
- Hello. - Have you been well?

180
00:06:33,137 --> 00:06:34,238
Sechs Kies.

181
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:36,108
It's nice.

182
00:06:36,738 --> 00:06:38,277
Shake that booty!

183
00:06:40,248 --> 00:06:41,277
Hello.

184
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:43,118
(Who are the guests with beautiful backs?)

185
00:06:43,118 --> 00:06:44,447
- Hello. - Hello.

186
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:48,488
(Who are the guests with beautiful backs?)

187
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:51,017
- Hello. - My goodness, Soyou.

188
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:55,197
(The healthy beauty, Soyou)

189
00:06:55,358 --> 00:06:56,457
Who is she?

190
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,728
(She is...)

191
00:06:57,728 --> 00:06:58,998
Elijah, you are back!

192
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:04,067
(The innocent actress, Lee Elijah)

193
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:05,608
- My goodness. - Hey.

194
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:07,308
Elisa?

195
00:07:07,507 --> 00:07:08,608
It's Elijah.

196
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:10,438
- Elijah. - Are you kidding me?

197
00:07:10,538 --> 00:07:11,808
Elijah.

198
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:13,647
Elijah, you are back.

199
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:15,717
- Are you the only ones here? - What?

200
00:07:15,717 --> 00:07:18,077
- Are you the only ones here? - We split up into groups.

201
00:07:18,077 --> 00:07:20,017
- Are you the only ones here? - It's just the two of us.

202
00:07:20,017 --> 00:07:22,317
- I repeated myself so many times. - It's disappointing.

203
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,457
- Are you disappointed? - What are you talking about?

204
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:25,587
I am happy to see you.

205
00:07:25,587 --> 00:07:27,327
- You should be happy to see us. - I am happy to see you.

206
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:29,757
This is incredible. We chose the right coach.

207
00:07:29,897 --> 00:07:32,897
(The production crew took Korail's safety education.)

208
00:07:33,728 --> 00:07:37,438
The teams have 4, 4, and 7 members respectively.

209
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:40,767
For today's race, 3 teams of 5 members are needed.

210
00:07:41,207 --> 00:07:44,877
- From the team with seven members, - Perfect!

211
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:47,877
Two members must move to the other teams.

212
00:07:47,877 --> 00:07:50,317
(2 members must move to the other teams.)

213
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:52,048
- Come on. - That's good.

214
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:54,387
- Can Jae Seok and I move? - Yes, you can.

215
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:55,418
- Anyone can move. - Can we move, too?

216
00:07:55,418 --> 00:07:56,887
- Anyone can move. - My goodness.

217
00:07:56,887 --> 00:07:59,288
You can't go.

218
00:08:00,058 --> 00:08:02,127
- Don't even think about it. - Ji Won became serious.

219
00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:04,658
- Don't even think about it. - He became serious.

220
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:05,928
Here is what we will do.

221
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:10,337
Why don't the teams with four members decide...

222
00:08:10,337 --> 00:08:12,868
- which member they want? - Will the first choices move?

223
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,938
That's right. The first choices will move to the other teams.

224
00:08:14,938 --> 00:08:17,507
Tell me which member you want.

225
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:18,908
(Whispering)

226
00:08:20,248 --> 00:08:22,248
- Su Won. - Really?

227
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:24,647
So Min wants...

228
00:08:24,647 --> 00:08:26,618
- Su Won. - Su Won.

229
00:08:26,618 --> 00:08:29,418
Seok Jin wants Ji Won.

230
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:31,558
He isn't the only name you know, right?

231
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:32,688
What are you talking about?

232
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:33,987
Then give me their names. Who is he?

233
00:08:33,987 --> 00:08:35,497
Stop it.

234
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:37,857
(He becomes angry.)

235
00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:38,997
For goodness' sake.

236
00:08:38,997 --> 00:08:41,327
Of course, I know their names!

237
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:44,067
- What is wrong with you? - You are ridiculous.

238
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,097
My goodness.

239
00:08:45,097 --> 00:08:46,668
- It's a reasonable question. - Tell me.

240
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:48,207
- Stop it. - I mean...

241
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:49,938
Why wouldn't I know the names of the six crystals?

242
00:08:49,938 --> 00:08:51,278
Who is he?

243
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:53,908
Stop it.

244
00:08:54,707 --> 00:08:56,418
- Come on. - Don't be disappointed.

245
00:08:56,418 --> 00:08:58,317
- He doesn't know. - That's not true.

246
00:08:58,317 --> 00:09:00,717
Now, it looks like I really don't know their names.

247
00:09:00,847 --> 00:09:03,987
Su Won will go to So Min's team.

248
00:09:03,987 --> 00:09:05,788
- Yes. - Yes. Come on.

249
00:09:05,788 --> 00:09:07,857
It's Jong Kook's team.

250
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:10,128
Su Won, this is great. Welcome.

251
00:09:10,128 --> 00:09:11,227
This is amazing.

252
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:13,327
Kicking out the member who lose in rock-paper-scissors...

253
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:15,298
would be a better way.

254
00:09:15,298 --> 00:09:16,867
All right. Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

255
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:18,538
The one who loses will join our team.

256
00:09:18,538 --> 00:09:20,308
Seok Jin is looking up Sechs Kies.

257
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:22,337
Seok Jin is looking up Sechs Kies.

258
00:09:22,878 --> 00:09:24,878
I am serious. Seok Jin is looking up Sechs Kies.

259
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:26,947
- Stop it. - Seok Jin is looking up Sechs Kies.

260
00:09:26,947 --> 00:09:28,308
That's not true.

261
00:09:28,678 --> 00:09:30,048
- Hold on. - Let's win.

262
00:09:30,048 --> 00:09:31,577
- The winner moves. - The winner moves.

263
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:33,288
- It's a single-round match. - Let's go, Sung Hoon.

264
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:34,347
(Seok Jin suddenly roots for Sung Hoon.)

265
00:09:35,518 --> 00:09:37,357
- Why are you suddenly doing that? - He began to use their names.

266
00:09:37,357 --> 00:09:39,428
He began to use their names after looking them up.

267
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:40,857
Sung Hoon, don't lose.

268
00:09:41,388 --> 00:09:42,428
Kang Sung Hoon.

269
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:43,497
"Kang" means "Strong".

270
00:09:43,658 --> 00:09:44,798
"Sung" means "Achievement".

271
00:09:44,957 --> 00:09:46,067
"Hoon" means "Handsome".

272
00:09:47,298 --> 00:09:51,438
(Team White, Team Gray, and Team Black)

273
00:09:51,737 --> 00:09:55,678
You will have a race to celebrate Pyeongchang Winter Olympics...

274
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,778
with the 1,000-dollar prize money and the water bomb penalty.

275
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:01,148
- It's freezing outside. - Water bomb?

276
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:02,447
If you get hit with the water bomb today...

277
00:10:02,878 --> 00:10:05,317
- This is bad. - The water will freeze instantly.

278
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:08,658
This is Running Man's Loyal Pick, Race of Discontentment.

279
00:10:08,658 --> 00:10:10,558
Someone will be discontent.

280
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:13,688
Each round has Fire Stickers for the prize money...

281
00:10:13,788 --> 00:10:16,457
and Ice Stickers for the penalty on the line.

282
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,467
The team that places 1st gets 10 Fire Stickers.

283
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:22,237
The team that places last gets 10 Ice Stickers.

284
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:24,768
- That's a lot. - Then the team chooses an order...

285
00:10:24,768 --> 00:10:25,908
to play the Loyalty Game.

286
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:29,278
In the chosen order, the members take as many stickers as they want.

287
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:31,577
It will make you distrustful.

288
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:34,778
The one with the most number of Fire Stickers wins...

289
00:10:34,778 --> 00:10:36,817
- and acquires the prize money. - There's only one winner?

290
00:10:36,817 --> 00:10:39,117
The one with the most number of Ice Stickers loses.

291
00:10:39,117 --> 00:10:41,347
The loser and his or her pick gets...

292
00:10:41,347 --> 00:10:44,788
- the water bomb penalty. - Does the loser get to pick one?

293
00:10:44,788 --> 00:10:47,487
- We must be nice to the loser. - Now,

294
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:50,327
you will have the first mission for the stickers.

295
00:10:50,457 --> 00:10:51,967
The first mission is...

296
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:53,827
Zombie Game, Train to Pyeongchang.

297
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:55,837
(Zombie Game, Train to Pyeongchang)

298
00:10:56,668 --> 00:10:57,967
You have three minutes.

299
00:10:58,067 --> 00:11:01,308
The team with the most number of survivors...

300
00:11:01,308 --> 00:11:03,207
who avoid the zombies and cross the finish line wins.

301
00:11:03,577 --> 00:11:05,308
One team will wear blindfolds...

302
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:07,508
and attack the other team as zombies.

303
00:11:08,378 --> 00:11:11,278
- Two teams will move over. - Let's go.

304
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:16,117
(Team Offensive versus Team Defensive)

305
00:11:16,457 --> 00:11:17,918
It will be very difficult to go through them.

306
00:11:17,918 --> 00:11:19,158
There is nowhere to go.

307
00:11:19,487 --> 00:11:22,028
One person should continue to make noises.

308
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:23,497
He or she should do this...

309
00:11:23,497 --> 00:11:25,628
to draw the zombies.

310
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,768
Zombies, please wear blindfolds.

311
00:11:28,097 --> 00:11:29,438
This is scary.

312
00:11:29,668 --> 00:11:31,268
Kwang Soo really looks like a zombie.

313
00:11:31,268 --> 00:11:32,408
(Come, my preys.)

314
00:11:32,408 --> 00:11:33,607
Look at his arms.

315
00:11:33,607 --> 00:11:35,207
(He is serious.)

316
00:11:35,207 --> 00:11:38,138
(Kwang Soo, the zombie, is ready.)

317
00:11:38,577 --> 00:11:40,008
Let's go as a group.

318
00:11:41,477 --> 00:11:42,548
- Jae Duck. - Yes?

319
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:45,288
Tell me if the people are on your left or right.

320
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,817
- You will be able to sense them. - Okay.

321
00:11:46,817 --> 00:11:48,317
We only need to hold them out for three minutes.

322
00:11:48,418 --> 00:11:50,258
Three minutes is too short.

323
00:11:50,357 --> 00:11:51,987
Let's get started. Get ready.

324
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:56,727
(Can Jae Seok's team move past the zombies and survive?)

325
00:11:56,727 --> 00:11:57,727
Set.

326
00:11:57,727 --> 00:12:00,398
(The 1st round of Zombie Game starts.)

327
00:12:00,398 --> 00:12:01,997
- Let's go. - Here.

328
00:12:01,997 --> 00:12:04,837
- They went to the right. - The right?

329
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:07,107
(The zombie bites the bait.)

330
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:08,207
The right.

331
00:12:08,678 --> 00:12:10,737
(The first obstacle is Soyou, the zombie.)

332
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:13,648
(She swings her long arms.)

333
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:15,577
(Careful)

334
00:12:15,577 --> 00:12:17,117
- I didn't feel them. - Where are they?

335
00:12:17,117 --> 00:12:18,317
I don't know.

336
00:12:18,317 --> 00:12:19,947
Did they get past you? Soyou.

337
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,418
No, no one got past me.

338
00:12:21,418 --> 00:12:23,217
Did they get past you?

339
00:12:23,217 --> 00:12:25,327
- Did they get past you? - No one got past me.

340
00:12:25,357 --> 00:12:26,788
- Go to the left. - No one got past you, right?

341
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,597
I will go this way.

342
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,457
(He carefully takes the upper route.)

343
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:32,597
(Grabbing)

344
00:12:32,597 --> 00:12:33,727
There you are.

345
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:35,268
(She grabs him.)

346
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:37,538
(Soyou, the zombie, catches a prey.)

347
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:39,107
I got one.

348
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:40,408
I got one.

349
00:12:40,408 --> 00:12:41,878
- Did you get one? - I got one.

350
00:12:43,237 --> 00:12:46,378
(This is my chance.)

351
00:12:46,378 --> 00:12:48,847
(Ji Won wriggles his way...)

352
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:52,487
(to the 3rd obstacle.)

353
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:53,817
Did you get one?

354
00:12:53,817 --> 00:12:55,087
(Moving)

355
00:12:55,587 --> 00:12:57,717
- Someone is passing by. - Where?

356
00:12:57,817 --> 00:12:59,028
Someone is passing by.

357
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,227
- Someone is passing by. - Where?

358
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:02,457
Someone is passing by.

359
00:13:02,457 --> 00:13:04,457
(He faces the biggest crisis.)

360
00:13:04,457 --> 00:13:06,997
(The zombies close in on him.)

361
00:13:06,997 --> 00:13:09,268
(Can Ji Won survive?)

362
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:10,438
I got one!

363
00:13:10,438 --> 00:13:11,538
(Cheerful)

364
00:13:11,597 --> 00:13:12,967
It's me!

365
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:14,867
- I got one! - It's me!

366
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:16,077
(He averts the crisis thanks to the zombies' confusion.)

367
00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:18,008
- Why would you grab me? - I am sorry.

368
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:20,607
(How nice!)

369
00:13:20,607 --> 00:13:22,217
Elijah.

370
00:13:22,317 --> 00:13:25,747
(Ji Won manages to survive by diving to the floor.)

371
00:13:25,747 --> 00:13:26,947
Did he get past me?

372
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:28,658
Where is he?

373
00:13:29,587 --> 00:13:31,217
I think someone just passed me by.

374
00:13:31,217 --> 00:13:32,428
Someone passed by.

375
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:33,487
(The scared three can't go forward.)

376
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:34,987
I think someone just passed me by.

377
00:13:34,987 --> 00:13:37,357
(Jae Jin plucks up his courage and starts moving.)

378
00:13:37,428 --> 00:13:39,668
Where are they? I can't believe this.

379
00:13:39,898 --> 00:13:41,938
- Where are they? - No one has come here yet.

380
00:13:41,938 --> 00:13:43,737
- No? - I don't think they've moved far.

381
00:13:44,638 --> 00:13:47,467
Maybe they're moving slowly on purpose.

382
00:13:48,508 --> 00:13:49,607
Quiet.

383
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:50,607
Here...

384
00:13:51,077 --> 00:13:52,077
I caught one.

385
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:56,048
(Soyou reaches her long arms out with an animal instinct.)

386
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:59,487
- I caught one! - I caught one!

387
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:00,487
I caught one!

388
00:14:00,487 --> 00:14:02,457
(This is my chance.)

389
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:06,987
(They try to move while the zombies are distracted by Jae Seok.)

390
00:14:08,697 --> 00:14:09,697
(Ji Won moves past Elijah.)

391
00:14:09,697 --> 00:14:11,658
- I caught one. - Come here.

392
00:14:12,528 --> 00:14:14,967
(Ji Won moves past the last zombie, Kwang Soo.)

393
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:17,898
(He enters the safe zone.)

394
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:21,538
(Ji Won survived.)

395
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,278
I caught one.

396
00:14:23,438 --> 00:14:24,577
One minute left.

397
00:14:24,577 --> 00:14:25,977
(There's 1 minute left.)

398
00:14:25,977 --> 00:14:28,447
(Sung Hoon and Se Chan are left.)

399
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:29,617
Okay.

400
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:33,018
(Will they survive?)

401
00:14:36,058 --> 00:14:37,258
There's one over here.

402
00:14:37,258 --> 00:14:40,128
(You're hiding there.)

403
00:14:40,227 --> 00:14:41,288
I caught one!

404
00:14:41,288 --> 00:14:44,658
(Jae Duck is about to catch Se Chan.)

405
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:47,028
Where did he go? I caught one!

406
00:14:47,028 --> 00:14:49,497
(Se Chan gets down on the floor.)

407
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:51,038
- Hold on. - I caught one!

408
00:14:51,038 --> 00:14:52,438
- I caught one. - I caught one.

409
00:14:52,908 --> 00:14:54,237
I caught one.

410
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:56,878
This part is difficult.

411
00:14:56,878 --> 00:14:58,607
I caught one.

412
00:14:58,607 --> 00:14:59,707
(Sung Hoon moves forward.)

413
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:04,717
I caught one!

414
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:06,188
(I caught one!)

415
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:07,388
I'm a staff member.

416
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:08,617
You're a staff member?

417
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:14,758
(It's easy to deceive a zombie.)

418
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:17,298
There's only one minute left.

419
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:20,827
No one has succeeded yet.

420
00:15:20,827 --> 00:15:22,798
(We've succeeded.)

421
00:15:23,997 --> 00:15:28,107
(Team Jae Seok's Ji Won and Sung Hoon survive.)

422
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:30,008
- Did you catch them all? - Two survived.

423
00:15:30,008 --> 00:15:32,178
Really?

424
00:15:32,178 --> 00:15:34,207
- Two survived. - How did you do it?

425
00:15:34,207 --> 00:15:35,447
Two survived?

426
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:38,447
How could you not catch any?

427
00:15:39,747 --> 00:15:41,888
- When did Sung Hoon pass by? - When did you pass by?

428
00:15:43,288 --> 00:15:45,357
(Offense: Seok Jin, Kwang Soo, Elijah Soyou, and Jae Duck)

429
00:15:45,357 --> 00:15:46,827
(Defense: Ji Hyo, So Min, Jong Kook, Haha, and Su Won)

430
00:15:47,087 --> 00:15:48,928
We have to pass by Jong Kook.

431
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:50,898
They have Jong Kook.

432
00:15:51,528 --> 00:15:52,597
What should we do?

433
00:15:52,597 --> 00:15:54,497
Wouldn't you pass out if you get hit by him?

434
00:15:54,898 --> 00:15:56,138
Is it really okay?

435
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:58,038
Is it okay?

436
00:15:58,668 --> 00:15:59,908
We have to catch them, right?

437
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:01,067
Gosh.

438
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:03,237
(The 3rd zombie is very muscular.)

439
00:16:03,237 --> 00:16:04,278
Ready.

440
00:16:06,908 --> 00:16:08,107
And...

441
00:16:08,107 --> 00:16:11,217
(Will Team Seok Jin survive the zombies?)

442
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:13,648
(The 2nd round of the zombie game begins.)

443
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:14,888
Let's go!

444
00:16:16,617 --> 00:16:18,928
- Here we go! - There's one here.

445
00:16:19,727 --> 00:16:22,798
(The 1st zombie is Haha.)

446
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:23,798
(Careful)

447
00:16:23,798 --> 00:16:25,128
Here we go!

448
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:28,798
Someone is passing by.

449
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:31,597
I just felt something.

450
00:16:31,597 --> 00:16:33,237
(Soyou was able to dodge Haha.)

451
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:35,678
I caught one!

452
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:37,378
(I caught one!)

453
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:40,107
- I caught one. - It's my arm.

454
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:42,548
(It's my arm.)

455
00:16:43,178 --> 00:16:44,278
Hold on.

456
00:16:44,548 --> 00:16:47,048
- It was Haha. - The cameraman is here.

457
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:49,987
I caught one.

458
00:16:49,987 --> 00:16:53,158
(Elijah tries to go past the 1st zombie.)

459
00:16:54,028 --> 00:16:56,258
Someone is passing by. Someone's here.

460
00:16:56,628 --> 00:16:57,928
- Where? - Hair?

461
00:16:57,928 --> 00:16:59,428
- Someone's passing by. - I caught one.

462
00:16:59,428 --> 00:17:01,197
- I caught one. - Where?

463
00:17:01,837 --> 00:17:03,797
Someone's passing by again. I caught one.

464
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:07,568
(Elijah goes past So Min too.)

465
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:11,507
(Soyou starts to move.)

466
00:17:11,507 --> 00:17:13,477
I hear a sound from the left side.

467
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:15,318
- Here. - Who is it?

468
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:17,078
- It's me. - Someone is here.

469
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,947
Something touched my leg. Someone is here.

470
00:17:20,418 --> 00:17:23,287
Something touched my leg.

471
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:24,987
Something just passed on the right.

472
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:30,297
(The male members have yet to start moving.)

473
00:17:30,727 --> 00:17:31,757
Someone's passing by again.

474
00:17:31,757 --> 00:17:34,368
(Distracted)

475
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:36,438
Someone is here.

476
00:17:36,668 --> 00:17:38,168
Something touched my leg.

477
00:17:38,368 --> 00:17:40,207
Something is touching my right leg.

478
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,878
Something just passed by on my right side.

479
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:43,908
(Gosh)

480
00:17:43,908 --> 00:17:45,247
- I caught one! - You caught one?

481
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:46,648
I caught one.

482
00:17:48,078 --> 00:17:49,618
- I caught one. - I caught one.

483
00:17:50,578 --> 00:17:53,247
(Let me try.)

484
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:56,287
I caught one. It's Seok Jin.

485
00:17:56,818 --> 00:17:57,918
Where?

486
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:00,088
- I caught one. - I caught one.

487
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:01,688
I caught one.

488
00:18:03,158 --> 00:18:06,428
(It's my turn.)

489
00:18:07,697 --> 00:18:08,737
(Jae Duck and Kwang Soo are stuck at the 2nd hurdle.)

490
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:09,938
Hey!

491
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:11,737
Someone is on the left side.

492
00:18:11,838 --> 00:18:13,537
On the left side?

493
00:18:13,537 --> 00:18:14,568
(I have to break through.)

494
00:18:15,578 --> 00:18:16,638
(Jae Duck escapes.)

495
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:17,737
You caught one? Keep him.

496
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:19,777
- Who is it? - Who is it?

497
00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:20,908
(Kwang Soo fights with a zombie.)

498
00:18:21,507 --> 00:18:23,047
Who is it?

499
00:18:23,547 --> 00:18:25,688
It must be Kwang Soo. Over here.

500
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,688
(Kwang Soo makes a strategic retreat.)

501
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:32,987
Someone is on the left side.

502
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,727
(He has to hide his pain.)

503
00:18:36,457 --> 00:18:39,168
Someone is here.

504
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:40,398
Where?

505
00:18:40,398 --> 00:18:41,467
(No one has succeeded yet.)

506
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:42,598
(We don't have much time left.)

507
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:44,438
- Who is it? - It's me.

508
00:18:44,438 --> 00:18:46,307
(We can't wait any longer. Move forward, Elijah!)

509
00:18:46,307 --> 00:18:48,168
Soyou is a bait.

510
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,638
- I'll keep Soyou. - Okay.

511
00:18:49,707 --> 00:18:50,977
Soyou!

512
00:18:50,977 --> 00:18:52,148
Get her!

513
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:53,848
Soyou.

514
00:18:53,848 --> 00:18:55,777
Hold on. Soyou.

515
00:18:55,777 --> 00:18:56,777
(Nice teamwork.)

516
00:18:56,777 --> 00:18:58,148
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

517
00:18:58,148 --> 00:18:59,918
- I love you. - I'll keep Soyou.

518
00:18:59,918 --> 00:19:01,987
I can't move.

519
00:19:01,987 --> 00:19:03,217
I love you.

520
00:19:04,118 --> 00:19:06,328
(Escaping)

521
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:07,928
Someone is here!

522
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:10,598
(Jae Duck has been spotted by Ji Hyo.)

523
00:19:10,598 --> 00:19:12,068
Su Won, someone is here!

524
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,568
(Will he be able to escape?)

525
00:19:15,537 --> 00:19:16,868
Someone just passed by.

526
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:19,007
On the left side.

527
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:21,938
(Will Jae Duck escape with his agility?)

528
00:19:21,938 --> 00:19:23,138
Jae Duck!

529
00:19:23,138 --> 00:19:26,908
(This is my chance.)

530
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:28,618
(Approaching)

531
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:32,148
Su Won, to the right. To the left.

532
00:19:32,148 --> 00:19:35,358
(Thanks to Soyou, Jae Duck enters the safe zone.)

533
00:19:35,358 --> 00:19:38,057
(Jae Duck survives.)

534
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:39,388
Elijah escaped.

535
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:42,297
To the left.

536
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:44,227
(Kwang Soo is the only one left.)

537
00:19:44,227 --> 00:19:46,128
I have to keep Seok Jin, right?

538
00:19:46,128 --> 00:19:48,068
I'm keeping him.

539
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:51,068
- Someone is breathing very heavily. - Someone is passing by.

540
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:56,838
Who is it? It's me. Why do you touch my chest?

541
00:19:56,838 --> 00:19:59,108
(She accidentally touches Jong Kook's chest.)

542
00:19:59,108 --> 00:20:00,348
So Min!

543
00:20:00,747 --> 00:20:03,578
(Oh, was it your chest?)

544
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:06,188
(She was working too hard.)

545
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:09,388
- I can't see anything. I'm sorry. - I chose the wrong outfit.

546
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:12,957
Who is it? Someone is here.

547
00:20:12,957 --> 00:20:14,287
Someone is here.

548
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:16,098
I caught one!

549
00:20:16,457 --> 00:20:17,828
(Hitting)

550
00:20:18,797 --> 00:20:21,227
(He struggles to survive, )

551
00:20:21,227 --> 00:20:24,197
(but the time is over.)

552
00:20:24,197 --> 00:20:26,068
- Hey, come here. - Jong Kook.

553
00:20:26,068 --> 00:20:27,707
I didn't mean to.

554
00:20:27,938 --> 00:20:30,307
- You hit my head. - I thought you were a zombie.

555
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:33,777
I couldn't move past here.

556
00:20:33,777 --> 00:20:36,017
- Elijah was so fast. - She's good.

557
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,747
Me?

558
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:40,848
- It's a tie. - It's 2 to 2.

559
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:43,757
(Offense: Ji Hyo, So Min, Jong Kook, Haha, and Su Won)

560
00:20:43,757 --> 00:20:45,557
(Defense: Jae Seok, Se Chan, Sung Hoon, Ji Won, and Jae Jin)

561
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:47,688
The zombies are coming.

562
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:50,997
If I catch Jong Kook, I'll use my strength.

563
00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:52,628
Be my guest.

564
00:20:53,027 --> 00:20:55,237
No, I won't. Just pass me by.

565
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:57,368
Tap me on the shoulder twice, and I'll move to the right.

566
00:20:58,338 --> 00:20:59,668
Tap me on the shoulder, and I'll...

567
00:20:59,668 --> 00:21:00,807
"Go, Jong Kook."

568
00:21:01,237 --> 00:21:03,037
It looks so dense.

569
00:21:03,037 --> 00:21:04,378
He'll hit you.

570
00:21:04,378 --> 00:21:07,207
- They look so strong. - They're all guys.

571
00:21:08,007 --> 00:21:09,078
They look robust.

572
00:21:09,148 --> 00:21:10,777
Let's get it.

573
00:21:10,777 --> 00:21:14,118
Here we go. You have three minutes. Start when I blow the whistle.

574
00:21:14,517 --> 00:21:16,457
Ready, and...

575
00:21:16,457 --> 00:21:19,457
(The 3rd round of the zombie game starts.)

576
00:21:19,557 --> 00:21:22,858
(Come on.)

577
00:21:22,858 --> 00:21:25,227
(Jae Jin waves his arms.)

578
00:21:25,227 --> 00:21:26,568
One person is coming.

579
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:28,368
(Team Jong Kook is trying to distract the zombies with sounds.)

580
00:21:28,368 --> 00:21:29,438
Someone is coming.

581
00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:30,497
(Team Jong Kook is trying to distract the zombies with sounds.)

582
00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:39,747
(Guys, )

583
00:21:39,747 --> 00:21:41,818
(let's go.)

584
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:46,318
(Jong Kook confronts the zombie.)

585
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:47,487
(The others move forward.)

586
00:21:47,487 --> 00:21:49,388
Jong Kook, it hurts!

587
00:21:50,658 --> 00:21:52,757
(What is this human being doing?)

588
00:21:52,858 --> 00:21:55,128
(Do you remember those muscular guys in zombie movies?)

589
00:21:55,128 --> 00:21:57,497
It hurts! Hold on.

590
00:21:57,757 --> 00:22:00,197
(They fight the zombies with bare hands.)

591
00:22:00,197 --> 00:22:01,697
Hold on.

592
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:04,398
Wait. Let go of me.

593
00:22:04,838 --> 00:22:07,737
(Jong Kook is sacrificing himself for the team.)

594
00:22:07,737 --> 00:22:10,108
- Wait! - What are you doing?

595
00:22:10,108 --> 00:22:12,047
(All zombies, come to me.)

596
00:22:12,047 --> 00:22:14,648
Hold on, Jong Kook...

597
00:22:14,807 --> 00:22:16,178
What is this?

598
00:22:16,178 --> 00:22:17,878
(Let go of me.)

599
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,118
What is he doing?

600
00:22:19,318 --> 00:22:21,047
Get him!

601
00:22:21,047 --> 00:22:23,487
He's a zombie.

602
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:26,188
Hey, get them!

603
00:22:26,188 --> 00:22:28,227
Jong Kook got us.

604
00:22:28,227 --> 00:22:29,697
He's a zombie!

605
00:22:29,928 --> 00:22:31,828
- What are you doing? - Gosh.

606
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:33,828
I caught one.

607
00:22:35,598 --> 00:22:38,098
(So Min is out.)

608
00:22:38,098 --> 00:22:39,368
(The zombies are distracted by So Min.)

609
00:22:39,368 --> 00:22:41,807
Wait. Where are you grabbing?

610
00:22:41,807 --> 00:22:42,908
(Su Won manages to escape.)

611
00:22:43,378 --> 00:22:45,707
I caught one.

612
00:22:45,707 --> 00:22:47,078
(Su Won survives.)

613
00:22:47,078 --> 00:22:50,148
- I caught one. - Hurry.

614
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:53,017
Gosh!

615
00:22:53,918 --> 00:22:55,318
Someone is over here.

616
00:22:55,418 --> 00:22:56,787
Someone is here.

617
00:22:56,787 --> 00:22:57,818
Where?

618
00:23:00,257 --> 00:23:02,858
Here. I got him.

619
00:23:02,858 --> 00:23:04,898
- I got him. - You got him?

620
00:23:07,697 --> 00:23:09,967
(All the zombies are on the right side.)

621
00:23:10,068 --> 00:23:12,608
(Ji Hyo tries to move forward on the left side.)

622
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:15,307
(The last zombie is waiting.)

623
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:19,947
(Ji Hyo, please survive.)

624
00:23:19,947 --> 00:23:21,247
Who is it?

625
00:23:21,247 --> 00:23:26,217
(So Min sacrifices herself.)

626
00:23:26,217 --> 00:23:27,447
(Ji Hyo enters the safe zone.)

627
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,787
- Who is it? - We caught one.

628
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:30,017
We caught one.

629
00:23:30,088 --> 00:23:31,457
It's over.

630
00:23:31,888 --> 00:23:33,027
Su Won survived.

631
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:34,557
Isn't he the only one?

632
00:23:37,128 --> 00:23:38,128
There are more.

633
00:23:38,128 --> 00:23:40,328
(Why are there two?)

634
00:23:40,328 --> 00:23:42,197
- Ji Hyo survived. - My goodness.

635
00:23:42,997 --> 00:23:45,207
How did you miss them?

636
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:48,368
If I were in the front, I would've probably caught three.

637
00:23:49,237 --> 00:23:50,578
Our scores are tied.

638
00:23:50,707 --> 00:23:51,807
They're all tied.

639
00:23:52,247 --> 00:23:55,517
(We used an empty coach to film the show.)

640
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,318
We have the results.

641
00:23:57,318 --> 00:23:58,348
- Okay. - Okay.

642
00:23:58,378 --> 00:24:01,517
Two members from each team survived.

643
00:24:01,717 --> 00:24:03,487
- What about duration? - Based on the duration...

644
00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:04,618
(Determine the winner by the duration of survival.)

645
00:24:04,618 --> 00:24:06,487
- We were fast. - That means my team won.

646
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,757
- Duration of survival? - The winning team is...

647
00:24:09,598 --> 00:24:10,598
It's our team.

648
00:24:10,598 --> 00:24:12,227
(Which team...)

649
00:24:12,227 --> 00:24:15,438
(will win 10 Fire Stickers?)

650
00:24:15,668 --> 00:24:16,898
Soyou and Lee Elijah.

651
00:24:16,898 --> 00:24:21,207
(Team Seok Jin wins.)

652
00:24:22,108 --> 00:24:23,338
I didn't expect that.

653
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:24,908
- Why? - Why did they win?

654
00:24:24,908 --> 00:24:27,547
They were caught the latest after 2 minutes 59 seconds.

655
00:24:27,547 --> 00:24:28,578
Goodness.

656
00:24:29,477 --> 00:24:30,578
We won.

657
00:24:30,648 --> 00:24:31,717
Who came second place?

658
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:32,818
The second place winner...

659
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,418
is Team Jong Kook.

660
00:24:35,118 --> 00:24:36,358
Good job.

661
00:24:36,358 --> 00:24:38,088
They had an advantage.

662
00:24:38,088 --> 00:24:40,428
We were so close. We did well.

663
00:24:40,428 --> 00:24:42,297
We were so close.

664
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:43,997
We were caught too quickly by Jong Kook.

665
00:24:43,997 --> 00:24:46,527
The winning team gets 10 Fire Stickers.

666
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,638
(Team Seok Jin wins 10 Fire Stickers.)

667
00:24:48,638 --> 00:24:50,368
10 is a lot.

668
00:24:50,737 --> 00:24:52,938
The losing team gets 10 Ice Stickers.

669
00:24:52,938 --> 00:24:54,368
What about the team in second place?

670
00:24:54,838 --> 00:24:58,648
You have a chance to guess the member who took...

671
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,608
the one with the most Fire Stickers and the one with the least Ice Stickers.

672
00:25:01,608 --> 00:25:03,118
If you guess correctly,

673
00:25:03,118 --> 00:25:06,848
Fire Stickers get switched with Ice Stickers.

674
00:25:07,648 --> 00:25:09,217
That's a big twist.

675
00:25:09,757 --> 00:25:13,287
If you guess the member with the least number of Ice Stickers,

676
00:25:13,287 --> 00:25:17,328
the member will get additional Ice Stickers to match the maximum.

677
00:25:17,828 --> 00:25:19,668
If the team guesses correctly,

678
00:25:19,668 --> 00:25:21,598
each member will receive a Fire Sticker.

679
00:25:21,598 --> 00:25:24,938
If you guess incorrectly, each member will receive an Ice Sticker.

680
00:25:24,938 --> 00:25:26,007
It's complicated.

681
00:25:26,737 --> 00:25:27,737
Shall we play rock-paper-scissors?

682
00:25:27,737 --> 00:25:29,138
Or shall we go in the order of age?

683
00:25:29,938 --> 00:25:31,737
(Seok Jin makes a sudden suggestion.)

684
00:25:31,737 --> 00:25:34,408
- It's because... - Shall the youngest go first?

685
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:36,517
- Shall the youngest go first? - Shall the oldest go first?

686
00:25:36,517 --> 00:25:37,878
Let's play rock-paper-scissors instead.

687
00:25:37,878 --> 00:25:39,217
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors.

688
00:25:40,348 --> 00:25:41,517
(Kwang Soo, Jae Duck, and Elijah win.)

689
00:25:41,517 --> 00:25:43,658
- Okay. - Okay.

690
00:25:44,257 --> 00:25:45,287
We'll take two each.

691
00:25:45,287 --> 00:25:47,658
- Kwang Soo can't be the 1st. - He can't be the 1st.

692
00:25:47,658 --> 00:25:48,828
- You must win. - Jae Duck won.

693
00:25:48,828 --> 00:25:50,128
No, we'll take two each.

694
00:25:50,128 --> 00:25:51,358
I keep my word.

695
00:25:51,358 --> 00:25:53,527
- Let's play. - Rock-paper-scissors.

696
00:25:53,527 --> 00:25:55,737
- You must win no matter what. - Rock-paper-scissors.

697
00:25:55,737 --> 00:25:58,138
(Kwang Soo and Elijah win.)

698
00:25:58,138 --> 00:26:00,568
It's over for them.

699
00:26:00,568 --> 00:26:02,507
- I still have a chance. - Kwang Soo must lose.

700
00:26:02,507 --> 00:26:04,378
- It has to be over six. - I have a chance.

701
00:26:04,378 --> 00:26:05,408
Please win.

702
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,707
If Kwang Soo wins, it's over for them.

703
00:26:07,707 --> 00:26:08,717
Rock-paper-scissors.

704
00:26:09,477 --> 00:26:10,878
(Elijah wins.)

705
00:26:10,878 --> 00:26:12,118
Thank goodness.

706
00:26:12,118 --> 00:26:13,447
Kwang Soo must be sad.

707
00:26:13,618 --> 00:26:15,818
Okay, please start.

708
00:26:15,818 --> 00:26:16,858
Go, Elijah.

709
00:26:17,257 --> 00:26:18,858
Which one should I choose?

710
00:26:22,328 --> 00:26:25,197
If they select me, do mine turn into Ice Stickers?

711
00:26:25,197 --> 00:26:26,928
- If you have the most. - Right.

712
00:26:26,928 --> 00:26:28,938
Elijah is competitive too.

713
00:26:28,938 --> 00:26:30,568
(She ponders for a while.)

714
00:26:30,568 --> 00:26:33,438
(Which one will she choose?)

715
00:26:34,807 --> 00:26:36,707
You don't need to think so hard.

716
00:26:36,707 --> 00:26:38,378
He won't make it.

717
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:41,947
He's taking a long time.

718
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,678
He's taking long to count.

719
00:26:44,247 --> 00:26:45,888
Winning a lot right now is pointless.

720
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,418
- Let's see. - Elijah.

721
00:26:47,418 --> 00:26:48,717
Listen.

722
00:26:49,257 --> 00:26:50,588
What?

723
00:26:51,017 --> 00:26:52,828
- Who's next? - Who's next?

724
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:54,987
How many will it be?

725
00:26:54,987 --> 00:26:57,098
Indicate the number with your fingers.

726
00:26:57,828 --> 00:26:59,328
Is it good to take many?

727
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:02,237
(What's going on?)

728
00:27:02,237 --> 00:27:03,767
What happened?

729
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:04,767
What?

730
00:27:04,767 --> 00:27:07,237
(There are none left.)

731
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:09,707
He's still deciding.

732
00:27:09,707 --> 00:27:11,378
How many should I take?

733
00:27:11,378 --> 00:27:12,878
- Can I take all? - Of course.

734
00:27:12,878 --> 00:27:14,108
- All of them? - Yes.

735
00:27:14,108 --> 00:27:16,418
- You can take all. - Take up to half.

736
00:27:16,418 --> 00:27:17,477
(The two took all 10.)

737
00:27:17,477 --> 00:27:18,517
He'll make a guess.

738
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:20,348
- Who's next? - It's me.

739
00:27:21,017 --> 00:27:23,287
(Seok Jin takes a look.)

740
00:27:24,658 --> 00:27:26,888
(He doesn't know what to do.)

741
00:27:28,457 --> 00:27:31,457
(He pretends as if some stickers remain.)

742
00:27:31,457 --> 00:27:32,497
People were conscientious.

743
00:27:32,497 --> 00:27:34,527
Seok Jin has nothing.

744
00:27:34,727 --> 00:27:36,138
Nothing was left for him.

745
00:27:36,138 --> 00:27:37,898
He definitely doesn't have any.

746
00:27:38,507 --> 00:27:39,507
They were conscientious.

747
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:41,938
- What? - Seok Jin.

748
00:27:41,938 --> 00:27:43,078
Take all the rest.

749
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,078
Soyou, take all the rest.

750
00:27:45,078 --> 00:27:46,747
That's why...

751
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:48,578
Listen.

752
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:52,088
If a member on your team is annoying,

753
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:54,017
- you'd want to guess him. - Goodness.

754
00:27:54,017 --> 00:27:57,557
If you guess correctly who has the most Fire Stickers...

755
00:27:58,318 --> 00:28:01,898
among those who have them,

756
00:28:02,128 --> 00:28:03,928
each member gets a Fire Sticker.

757
00:28:03,928 --> 00:28:06,997
The stickers of the one who had the most will switch to Ice.

758
00:28:06,997 --> 00:28:07,997
That's incredible.

759
00:28:07,997 --> 00:28:09,537
I hope Kwang Soo gets them.

760
00:28:09,638 --> 00:28:10,737
- He will. - If you guess incorrectly,

761
00:28:10,737 --> 00:28:13,408
each member will get an Ice Sticker.

762
00:28:14,207 --> 00:28:16,638
The answer is obvious if Kwang Soo went first,

763
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:18,378
but it could be Elijah.

764
00:28:18,378 --> 00:28:23,017
Look carefully into Elijah's eyes. She could be cunning.

765
00:28:23,017 --> 00:28:24,918
(She may be a trickster.)

766
00:28:24,918 --> 00:28:26,747
- No. - She's like us.

767
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:27,818
It's possible.

768
00:28:29,088 --> 00:28:30,757
They recognize each other.

769
00:28:30,757 --> 00:28:32,527
Doesn't So Min recognize it?

770
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:33,888
- Can you check? - Isn't she a trickster?

771
00:28:33,888 --> 00:28:35,527
- Can you check? - She definitely is.

772
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:36,928
- She is. - See?

773
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:38,527
(So Min confirms it.)

774
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:40,098
She's definitely a trickster.

775
00:28:40,098 --> 00:28:41,727
Whom do you guess?

776
00:28:41,727 --> 00:28:43,338
It's 1 of the 2.

777
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:46,138
(Is it Elijah or Kwang Soo?)

778
00:28:46,438 --> 00:28:49,237
I pick Elijah. I want to try something new today.

779
00:28:49,237 --> 00:28:50,438
Shout in the count of three.

780
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:51,807
In 3, 2, 1.

781
00:28:51,807 --> 00:28:52,807
- Elijah. - Elijah.

782
00:28:52,807 --> 00:28:54,977
(Everyone guesses Elijah.)

783
00:28:55,318 --> 00:28:58,318
(Did Elijah take the most number of Fire Stickers?)

784
00:28:58,547 --> 00:29:00,987
- Elijah... - Please.

785
00:29:01,318 --> 00:29:03,217
Did not take the most...

786
00:29:03,217 --> 00:29:05,888
(Did she take the most number of stickers?)

787
00:29:05,888 --> 00:29:09,358
- Fire Stickers. - Isn't that obvious?

788
00:29:09,358 --> 00:29:11,598
- Come on. - It must be Kwang Soo.

789
00:29:11,658 --> 00:29:14,868
- Kwang Soo is acting again. - The number of stickers she took...

790
00:29:14,868 --> 00:29:16,497
- How many? - is three.

791
00:29:16,668 --> 00:29:17,668
She took a lot.

792
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:19,138
Three is a lot.

793
00:29:20,807 --> 00:29:26,307
(She was afraid of her stickers turning into Ice Stickers.)

794
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:29,247
(She took 3 stickers.)

795
00:29:29,247 --> 00:29:32,388
(She took 3 instead of 2.)

796
00:29:33,517 --> 00:29:35,757
(Kwang Soo checked the remaining stickers.)

797
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:36,757
Seven.

798
00:29:36,757 --> 00:29:38,527
(He takes all.)

799
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,928
(It's not surprising.)

800
00:29:41,457 --> 00:29:45,398
Each member on the team receives an Ice Sticker.

801
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:46,828
(Each gets one Ice Sticker.)

802
00:29:47,467 --> 00:29:48,898
- She didn't take the most. - We all got it.

803
00:29:49,438 --> 00:29:50,467
(How could he take 7?)

804
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:51,467
It's because...

805
00:29:52,368 --> 00:29:53,368
Stop pretending.

806
00:29:53,368 --> 00:29:54,967
- Is it you after me? - Yes.

807
00:29:55,438 --> 00:29:56,737
They might guess me.

808
00:29:56,737 --> 00:29:57,878
Go on.

809
00:29:57,878 --> 00:29:59,477
(I'm sorry. You'll get used to it.)

810
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:01,918
That's it for Fire Stickers.

811
00:30:01,918 --> 00:30:03,717
It's time for Ice Stickers.

812
00:30:03,717 --> 00:30:06,217
Jae Seok will take more than one.

813
00:30:06,217 --> 00:30:07,547
(The one who takes the most gets penalized.)

814
00:30:07,618 --> 00:30:08,658
I don't want to take any.

815
00:30:09,088 --> 00:30:12,227
(After pondering, )

816
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,658
(they make a decision.)

817
00:30:15,797 --> 00:30:17,557
- It's your turn. - I knew it.

818
00:30:17,557 --> 00:30:19,128
Next up is Se Chan.

819
00:30:19,128 --> 00:30:20,527
- You'll be penalized. - I'm the last.

820
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,398
- Yes, it's automatic. - What do you think?

821
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:23,438
It was impressive.

822
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:26,108
(My goodness)

823
00:30:26,108 --> 00:30:28,777
(There are 5 stickers left.)

824
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:30,438
You'll take at least six.

825
00:30:30,438 --> 00:30:32,507
- Seriously. - He'll take at least six.

826
00:30:32,507 --> 00:30:33,547
(5 stickers remain.)

827
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:36,348
- Look at him. - How could you?

828
00:30:36,517 --> 00:30:37,818
All of you surprise me.

829
00:30:39,818 --> 00:30:42,858
One of you betrayed.

830
00:30:43,818 --> 00:30:45,388
Someone didn't take any.

831
00:30:45,388 --> 00:30:49,027
Someone pulled a trick.

832
00:30:49,027 --> 00:30:51,828
- It's someone wearing a beanie. - My guess is...

833
00:30:51,828 --> 00:30:53,697
My guess is Jae Seok.

834
00:30:54,128 --> 00:30:55,537
- Let's pick Ji Won. - Okay.

835
00:30:55,537 --> 00:30:57,898
- I think it's Jae Jin. - Who?

836
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,838
- Jae Jin? - I think it's him.

837
00:30:59,838 --> 00:31:02,138
He's suspicious because he's not talking much.

838
00:31:02,138 --> 00:31:04,707
- Right. - Jae Jin is blushing too.

839
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:07,608
- Let's do it. - Take a guess.

840
00:31:07,807 --> 00:31:09,848
1, 2, 3.

841
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,318
- Jae Jin. - Jae Jin.

842
00:31:11,477 --> 00:31:12,487
I'm curious.

843
00:31:12,487 --> 00:31:14,848
Here's the answer.

844
00:31:15,818 --> 00:31:17,757
Did Jae Jin take the least number of Ice Stickers?

845
00:31:17,757 --> 00:31:20,628
(Did he take the least number of stickers?)

846
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,628
That's correct.

847
00:31:21,628 --> 00:31:23,497
(He took the least number of stickers.)

848
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,767
- Wasn't I right? - It was right.

849
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:27,428
Wasn't I right?

850
00:31:27,497 --> 00:31:30,537
Jae Jin didn't take any Ice Stickers.

851
00:31:30,537 --> 00:31:31,638
(He took 0.)

852
00:31:31,638 --> 00:31:33,608
I knew it was Jae Jin.

853
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:37,438
Can I take nothing?

854
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:39,378
- It's possible. - I won't take any.

855
00:31:39,378 --> 00:31:40,608
(He played selfishly.)

856
00:31:41,707 --> 00:31:43,648
(He didn't know.)

857
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:45,787
How could he take nothing?

858
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:49,388
Jae Jin will get the same number of Ice Stickers...

859
00:31:49,388 --> 00:31:51,928
as the member who has the most.

860
00:31:52,227 --> 00:31:54,128
- Does he get as many as me? - Yes.

861
00:31:54,128 --> 00:31:56,227
That serves you right.

862
00:31:56,358 --> 00:31:59,368
I knew it when you pulled a trick. It serves you right.

863
00:31:59,628 --> 00:32:02,838
Gosh, what a relief.

864
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,737
(Number of Fire and Ice Stickers per member)

865
00:32:05,908 --> 00:32:06,908
It's snow.

866
00:32:07,507 --> 00:32:08,807
It's very high.

867
00:32:09,977 --> 00:32:10,977
Look at that.

868
00:32:10,977 --> 00:32:12,178
(It's very high.)

869
00:32:12,947 --> 00:32:14,707
(They arrive where the Olympics will be held.)

870
00:32:14,707 --> 00:32:15,777
That's impressive.

871
00:32:16,217 --> 00:32:17,217
Amazing.

872
00:32:17,717 --> 00:32:19,318
Do we get penalized here?

873
00:32:19,517 --> 00:32:20,517
It's so cold.

874
00:32:21,017 --> 00:32:22,418
This looks intense.

875
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:24,287
(He gets attacked.)

876
00:32:25,888 --> 00:32:27,557
(So Min throws snow at Kwang Soo.)

877
00:32:27,557 --> 00:32:29,328
I knew they'd cause trouble.

878
00:32:30,257 --> 00:32:31,727
That looks terrible.

879
00:32:31,727 --> 00:32:33,027
- I agree. - Right?

880
00:32:33,668 --> 00:32:35,767
(This is so much fun.)

881
00:32:37,098 --> 00:32:38,197
(Kwang Soo counterattacks.)

882
00:32:38,197 --> 00:32:39,767
Jong Kook!

883
00:32:40,138 --> 00:32:42,207
(She runs for help.)

884
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:44,838
Why do you always look for me when he's after you?

885
00:32:45,307 --> 00:32:46,648
You're the strongest.

886
00:32:46,977 --> 00:32:47,977
Did it hit you?

887
00:32:47,977 --> 00:32:48,977
(Please scold Kwang Soo.)

888
00:32:48,977 --> 00:32:49,977
Are you okay?

889
00:32:50,618 --> 00:32:52,088
Kwang Soo.

890
00:32:52,088 --> 00:32:53,388
Stop bothering So Min.

891
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,818
(Punching)

892
00:32:55,717 --> 00:32:58,188
(He takes her to the ground.)

893
00:32:58,487 --> 00:33:00,457
(Wait a minute.)

894
00:33:00,457 --> 00:33:01,457
Goodness.

895
00:33:01,457 --> 00:33:02,898
(This scene looks familiar.)

896
00:33:03,757 --> 00:33:07,197
(They look friendly as they play in the snow.)

897
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:11,767
(It's the exact scene from "Love Story".)

898
00:33:12,108 --> 00:33:14,207
(Look at the snow, So Min.)

899
00:33:14,467 --> 00:33:17,207
(Catch me if you can.)

900
00:33:17,207 --> 00:33:18,438
No.

901
00:33:18,438 --> 00:33:19,447
(What are they doing?)

902
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:20,507
Stop it.

903
00:33:20,507 --> 00:33:22,017
(What are they doing?)

904
00:33:22,017 --> 00:33:23,818
Snow got inside my clothes.

905
00:33:23,818 --> 00:33:26,118
- Are you okay? - I'm not okay, you punk.

906
00:33:26,118 --> 00:33:28,318
(She curses at him.)

907
00:33:28,318 --> 00:33:29,318
Hey.

908
00:33:29,318 --> 00:33:31,188
- Stop it, you two. - You guys should never date.

909
00:33:31,188 --> 00:33:34,088
- Don't ever date each other. - You are not meant to be.

910
00:33:34,088 --> 00:33:35,358
Hey, come back here.

911
00:33:35,358 --> 00:33:37,257
(Their love story ends with a fight again.)

912
00:33:37,257 --> 00:33:38,328
Hey, it's...

913
00:33:38,428 --> 00:33:39,767
- It's... - Yes?

914
00:33:39,997 --> 00:33:42,267
Snowing a lot here. The snow built up here.

915
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:44,938
- Everyone is feeling sentimental. - I know, right?

916
00:33:45,168 --> 00:33:48,267
- Elijah was singing. - She was singing?

917
00:33:50,037 --> 00:33:51,178
(A while ago)

918
00:33:51,178 --> 00:33:55,747
(Promise me, even if I might not be perfect)

919
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:58,348
- Which song did you sing? - Sing it. Start.

920
00:33:58,787 --> 00:33:59,987
(She sang "In Summer"?)

921
00:33:59,987 --> 00:34:01,188
That's not the song you sang.

922
00:34:01,188 --> 00:34:03,987
(The skies are open towards us)

923
00:34:04,217 --> 00:34:05,828
- That's "In Summer". - Sing the song you sang earlier.

924
00:34:06,188 --> 00:34:07,827
Why did she sing that song in winter?

925
00:34:08,287 --> 00:34:10,698
The skies are open toward us!

926
00:34:10,698 --> 00:34:12,668
This is what I mean about actors and actresses.

927
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:14,497
They do a good job at presenting themselves.

928
00:34:14,497 --> 00:34:16,938
(Look at her.)

929
00:34:16,938 --> 00:34:18,267
They do market themselves a lot.

930
00:34:18,338 --> 00:34:19,968
So many actresses are weird like her.

931
00:34:19,968 --> 00:34:23,008
(Elijah does show some signs of being slightly different.)

932
00:34:23,707 --> 00:34:29,048
(As soon as she sings the song, a snow storm engulfs them.)

933
00:34:29,378 --> 00:34:32,887
(What's the mission they'll play in the winter kingdom at minus 13°C?)

934
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:35,048
- It's cold. Let me speed it up. - Okay.

935
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:36,617
Your mission is...

936
00:34:36,988 --> 00:34:39,227
Shivering Ski Jumping.

937
00:34:39,227 --> 00:34:41,858
(Their mission is Shivering Ski Jumping.)

938
00:34:41,898 --> 00:34:43,997
- I'm shivering in this weather. - It's freezing.

939
00:34:43,997 --> 00:34:45,827
The weather does make me shiver.

940
00:34:46,198 --> 00:34:49,898
Within the time limit, 100 seconds, 2 representatives of each team...

941
00:34:49,898 --> 00:34:53,207
will do the skiing and jumping poses on the side.

942
00:34:53,207 --> 00:34:57,338
They can only mimic sounds and do gestures to explain the problems.

943
00:34:57,338 --> 00:35:00,407
The team that answers more questions in a relay will win.

944
00:35:00,577 --> 00:35:02,648
Choose your two representatives.

945
00:35:02,648 --> 00:35:04,517
The theme will be movies.

946
00:35:04,778 --> 00:35:06,347
- Movies. - All right then.

947
00:35:06,347 --> 00:35:08,688
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Okay. Let's do that.

948
00:35:08,688 --> 00:35:10,887
- Okay. Let's do that. Ji Hyo. - Let's play that.

949
00:35:10,887 --> 00:35:12,387
- Me? - Elijah, you should do it.

950
00:35:12,387 --> 00:35:14,128
- No, no. This is a lot of pressure. - Just play it. Do it.

951
00:35:14,128 --> 00:35:15,528
- This comes with a lot of pressure. - You don't have to win.

952
00:35:15,528 --> 00:35:17,028
- Elijah. - Yes?

953
00:35:17,028 --> 00:35:19,168
You should either wear the hat or take it off.

954
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,597
(I'm sorry to point this out, but do something with the hat.)

955
00:35:21,597 --> 00:35:24,068
(It's placed awkwardly.)

956
00:35:25,738 --> 00:35:26,807
Put it on.

957
00:35:26,807 --> 00:35:27,907
(Even her hat is clumsy.)

958
00:35:27,907 --> 00:35:30,207
- That's better. That's much better. - Just put it on.

959
00:35:30,207 --> 00:35:31,238
- All right. Rock-paper... - Don't be nervous.

960
00:35:31,238 --> 00:35:32,448
Rock-paper-scissors.

961
00:35:32,977 --> 00:35:35,218
(Su Won and Elijah win.)

962
00:35:35,218 --> 00:35:36,247
- Okay. - What is it?

963
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:38,548
- She won. - Rock-paper-scissors.

964
00:35:38,718 --> 00:35:41,957
(Elijah wins Su Won.)

965
00:35:41,957 --> 00:35:44,517
- The winner will go first! - No way!

966
00:35:44,787 --> 00:35:47,427
- Your team must go 1st. - The losing team will go 1st.

967
00:35:47,427 --> 00:35:50,398
- You must go first. You wanted it. - No, we didn't.

968
00:35:50,528 --> 00:35:53,227
- The winning team must go 1st. - No, the losing team must go 1st.

969
00:35:55,468 --> 00:35:56,938
No, my gloves!

970
00:35:56,938 --> 00:35:58,738
- You punk. - No, my gloves!

971
00:35:58,738 --> 00:36:01,637
(Elijah's gloves get stuck on Seok Jin's name tag.)

972
00:36:01,637 --> 00:36:03,938
- "No, my gloves!" - What a mess!

973
00:36:04,008 --> 00:36:05,347
She said, "No, my gloves."

974
00:36:05,347 --> 00:36:06,577
My gloves.

975
00:36:06,577 --> 00:36:09,718
(She is fighting for her gloves while others fight each other.)

976
00:36:09,718 --> 00:36:11,077
- The losing team should go first. - I agree.

977
00:36:11,278 --> 00:36:12,818
- Hurry. - Do rock-paper-scissors for it.

978
00:36:12,818 --> 00:36:15,218
This is for foreign films, and this is for Korean films. Got it?

979
00:36:15,557 --> 00:36:17,457
- This is for foreign films. - We've been brainwashed.

980
00:36:17,457 --> 00:36:19,128
- That's cheating. - It's for the number of syllables.

981
00:36:19,157 --> 00:36:21,427
Look at them. They are making signs.

982
00:36:21,427 --> 00:36:22,898
I can't believe they are making signals.

983
00:36:22,898 --> 00:36:24,258
You shouldn't allow that!

984
00:36:24,657 --> 00:36:25,927
How could they do that?

985
00:36:26,298 --> 00:36:27,497
The number of syllables for the title.

986
00:36:27,497 --> 00:36:29,898
- It's not right! Tell him! - What do you mean?

987
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,907
- What are you talking about? - You're doing that again?

988
00:36:31,907 --> 00:36:33,468
- He can't do that. - What?

989
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:36,477
- You can't give out signs. - You should've done it too.

990
00:36:36,537 --> 00:36:37,608
Hey.

991
00:36:37,637 --> 00:36:38,977
If we don't follow his order, he scolds us.

992
00:36:38,977 --> 00:36:42,177
(I don't want to do it either, but he scolds us.)

993
00:36:42,278 --> 00:36:43,577
- I get that. - Seriously.

994
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:45,218
- Okay. - You're right.

995
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,017
He scolds us if we don't.

996
00:36:47,418 --> 00:36:48,718
Okay!

997
00:36:48,718 --> 00:36:51,887
(Haha will mimic sounds, and So Min will do gestures.)

998
00:36:51,887 --> 00:36:53,387
- We are starting now. - Jong Kook,

999
00:36:53,387 --> 00:36:55,358
I'm sorry, but can you not block the keyword?

1000
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:56,858
(Please don't block the keyword.)

1001
00:36:56,858 --> 00:36:59,367
Oh, I see. Where is it? Okay.

1002
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:01,097
My gosh, you've got some guts.

1003
00:37:01,798 --> 00:37:04,537
(I'm Jong Kook's trainer.)

1004
00:37:04,537 --> 00:37:06,537
- Hey, Jong Kook. Move aside. - Let me go first.

1005
00:37:06,537 --> 00:37:08,037
(The 1st keyword is given.)

1006
00:37:08,068 --> 00:37:10,338
(He gives out the 1st onomatopoeic word.)

1007
00:37:11,077 --> 00:37:13,477
(She kneels down and throws her hands up.)

1008
00:37:13,807 --> 00:37:15,278
What's that? What was the title?

1009
00:37:15,278 --> 00:37:17,318
- What's that? I know that! - That was...

1010
00:37:18,077 --> 00:37:19,488
(Mumbling)

1011
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,648
(Kneeling down)

1012
00:37:20,648 --> 00:37:22,988
I want to go back!

1013
00:37:23,088 --> 00:37:24,918
Is he Maeng Gu? Did he turn into Maeng Gu?

1014
00:37:25,057 --> 00:37:26,258
He looks like Maeng Gu.

1015
00:37:26,258 --> 00:37:27,957
(He somewhat resembles Maeng Gu.)

1016
00:37:28,898 --> 00:37:31,867
(It's the famous scene from "Peppermint Candy".)

1017
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,997
- How could they not get it? - The title. I must say the title.

1018
00:37:36,537 --> 00:37:38,267
- "Peppermint Candy". - Okay!

1019
00:37:38,267 --> 00:37:40,168
(Ji Hyo answers it correctly.)

1020
00:37:40,168 --> 00:37:42,477
(The next up is Su Won.)

1021
00:37:42,477 --> 00:37:44,407
(The keyword is "Titanic".)

1022
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:47,907
"Titanic". It's "Titanic".

1023
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,977
(It's Jong Kook's turn.)

1024
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,188
That one was a giveaway.

1025
00:37:52,387 --> 00:37:55,017
(Gosh, this is a difficult one.)

1026
00:37:55,557 --> 00:37:56,887
Why do I always get the hard ones?

1027
00:37:58,157 --> 00:38:03,097
(Is he crying?)

1028
00:38:03,097 --> 00:38:04,628
(So Min throws something while sitting down.)

1029
00:38:04,628 --> 00:38:05,898
What is this one?

1030
00:38:05,898 --> 00:38:07,168
- Gosh, So Min. - "Memories of Murder".

1031
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:08,327
"Memories of Murder"?

1032
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:10,238
Gosh, So Min did such a good job.

1033
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:12,037
(Her gesture is just like the one from the film.)

1034
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:16,608
(Haha is wailing, and So Min is throwing something.)

1035
00:38:16,608 --> 00:38:19,707
(It's this scene from "The Wailing".)

1036
00:38:20,378 --> 00:38:21,577
(Jong Kook's still lost.)

1037
00:38:21,577 --> 00:38:22,977
- She's throwing a stone. - "The Lord of the Rings"?

1038
00:38:23,778 --> 00:38:25,287
That's a Korean film. You're throwing a stone?

1039
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:27,688
(Their teammates haven't even gotten close to the answer.)

1040
00:38:27,688 --> 00:38:30,957
(So Min is tired of throwing stones.)

1041
00:38:30,957 --> 00:38:33,457
(Okay. It's time for me to take charge now.)

1042
00:38:33,457 --> 00:38:35,858
- A joint film of Korea and Japan. - Stop it. Don't talk.

1043
00:38:35,858 --> 00:38:38,258
(Enunciating)

1044
00:38:38,798 --> 00:38:40,128
- Haha just spoke. - Hey.

1045
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,298
- That's enough. - Okay, okay.

1046
00:38:41,298 --> 00:38:42,798
He just spoke a phrase.

1047
00:38:43,267 --> 00:38:45,367
Thank you.

1048
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:46,738
- Don't talk! - Hey.

1049
00:38:46,738 --> 00:38:48,307
- Hey, you can't talk! - Stop talking.

1050
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,037
- Why are you talking? - You're not supposed to talk!

1051
00:38:50,177 --> 00:38:52,207
- The film... - Is that what matters now?

1052
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:54,148
I know that. I can't remember the title. What is it?

1053
00:38:55,347 --> 00:38:58,247
- That one doesn't count. - It's "The Wailing".

1054
00:38:58,747 --> 00:39:00,548
- It was "The Wailing". - Gosh.

1055
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:02,887
I knew the film, but I just couldn't remember the title.

1056
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:04,088
How am I supposed to do this?

1057
00:39:05,827 --> 00:39:07,887
(This is it. Ta-da!)

1058
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:13,097
(It's the most famous pose of Elsa from "Frozen".)

1059
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:14,398
"La La Land"?

1060
00:39:15,137 --> 00:39:17,137
My gosh, we are at a "frozen" world.

1061
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:19,307
(He starts talking again.)

1062
00:39:19,307 --> 00:39:20,438
- Hey! - Enough.

1063
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:21,608
- Haha. - He cheated.

1064
00:39:21,608 --> 00:39:23,278
- What are you doing? - Okay, I'll stop.

1065
00:39:23,577 --> 00:39:24,637
I'll be serious now.

1066
00:39:25,148 --> 00:39:27,247
- We can't count this again. - Okay.

1067
00:39:27,247 --> 00:39:29,747
- I'll pass. - It's hard! How should I do this?

1068
00:39:30,517 --> 00:39:31,887
Move back. Back up now.

1069
00:39:31,887 --> 00:39:33,088
("The Exorcist")

1070
00:39:33,088 --> 00:39:34,188
What should I do?

1071
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:35,588
(It's a difficult keyword.)

1072
00:39:37,287 --> 00:39:39,927
(Lying down)

1073
00:39:41,227 --> 00:39:44,898
(They must know this famous scene, right?)

1074
00:39:44,898 --> 00:39:46,267
- This is... - What is she doing?

1075
00:39:46,827 --> 00:39:47,997
What's that?

1076
00:39:48,698 --> 00:39:51,838
(He mimics the sounds the ghost makes perfectly.)

1077
00:39:52,508 --> 00:39:57,278
(They seem quite peculiar, but it looks like a horror film.)

1078
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,648
- "The Exorcist". "The Exorcist". - "The Exorcist".

1079
00:39:59,977 --> 00:40:01,148
- What's that? - "The Exorcist"?

1080
00:40:01,448 --> 00:40:03,048
- Is that something else? - "The Exorcist"?

1081
00:40:03,718 --> 00:40:05,017
("Spider-Man")

1082
00:40:05,188 --> 00:40:06,318
It's "Spider-Man".

1083
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:08,088
(They were so close, but time is up.)

1084
00:40:08,088 --> 00:40:09,988
- My gosh, it was so hard. - We got three questions?

1085
00:40:10,657 --> 00:40:12,957
- You answered three questions. - How could you not know the titles?

1086
00:40:13,057 --> 00:40:14,457
Hey, to be honest,

1087
00:40:14,628 --> 00:40:16,657
- So Min did well for "The Wailing". - Hey.

1088
00:40:16,657 --> 00:40:19,767
- So Min did a great job. - She was just like that actress.

1089
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:20,997
- Even her expression was the same. - "A joint film".

1090
00:40:20,997 --> 00:40:22,838
(So Min and Haha's hard work was evident.)

1091
00:40:23,738 --> 00:40:28,008
(Soyou mimics sounds, and Elijah does gestures next.)

1092
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:32,707
(Team Female Guests comes 1st after answering 5 questions.)

1093
00:40:34,008 --> 00:40:38,378
(Jae Jin and Se Chan's great teamwork puts them in 2nd place.)

1094
00:40:38,378 --> 00:40:43,117
(Team Male Guests is in 2nd place after answering 4 questions.)

1095
00:40:43,117 --> 00:40:44,358
We were so close.

1096
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,827
So Team Female Guests takes first place.

1097
00:40:46,827 --> 00:40:49,497
- Okay! - They won again.

1098
00:40:49,497 --> 00:40:50,927
Team Male Guests takes second place.

1099
00:40:50,927 --> 00:40:52,497
We're better than the other team. We are in second place at least.

1100
00:40:53,298 --> 00:40:54,898
Gosh, you guys just wait.

1101
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:57,398
- The winning team. - We are last.

1102
00:40:57,398 --> 00:40:59,168
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - Okay.

1103
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:00,668
(They will decide the order to choose the stickers.)

1104
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:02,108
You know what? It's a war now.

1105
00:41:02,108 --> 00:41:03,407
- I can't trust you. I won't! - No, no.

1106
00:41:03,407 --> 00:41:05,907
- We'll reveal them again, right? - Yes.

1107
00:41:05,907 --> 00:41:07,247
- Then let's each take two. - All right.

1108
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:08,747
- Let's take two each. - I'm serious this time.

1109
00:41:08,747 --> 00:41:09,818
- Let's take two. - They are going to reveal them.

1110
00:41:09,818 --> 00:41:11,278
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors.

1111
00:41:11,548 --> 00:41:12,617
Okay.

1112
00:41:12,617 --> 00:41:13,818
(The order is Elijah, Jae Duck, )

1113
00:41:13,818 --> 00:41:14,918
(Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, and Soyou.)

1114
00:41:16,718 --> 00:41:17,787
Come, please.

1115
00:41:18,588 --> 00:41:20,157
(Don't forget to take just 2.)

1116
00:41:20,628 --> 00:41:22,258
Point the ones you want in the briefcase.

1117
00:41:22,258 --> 00:41:24,557
(After thinking hard about it, )

1118
00:41:24,557 --> 00:41:27,068
(Elijah takes 3 Fire Stickers.)

1119
00:41:27,867 --> 00:41:30,798
(Let me take one more.)

1120
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:33,668
How many did you take?

1121
00:41:34,108 --> 00:41:35,577
- You should go. - It's my turn.

1122
00:41:37,477 --> 00:41:39,177
All right. Next member, please come.

1123
00:41:39,907 --> 00:41:41,878
Let me know how many you want with your fingers.

1124
00:41:43,948 --> 00:41:46,418
(There are three empty spots.)

1125
00:41:46,988 --> 00:41:49,188
(Come on, Elijah. I knew you'd do this.)

1126
00:41:49,457 --> 00:41:50,787
Elijah went first, right?

1127
00:41:53,287 --> 00:41:54,688
It's really hard to decide.

1128
00:41:54,688 --> 00:41:56,227
(Their plan is already a bust.)

1129
00:41:56,227 --> 00:42:00,767
(Jae Duck thinks hard about it. How many will he take?)

1130
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:02,537
- Jae Duck might take a lot. - Let one person take them all.

1131
00:42:02,537 --> 00:42:03,938
I thought the same thing. He went second.

1132
00:42:04,738 --> 00:42:05,867
Kwang Soo.

1133
00:42:06,267 --> 00:42:08,938
Use your fingers to tell me how many you want.

1134
00:42:08,938 --> 00:42:11,778
(I see. This is what it has come to.)

1135
00:42:12,448 --> 00:42:15,577
Kwang Soo will take everything if there's anything left. I'm sure.

1136
00:42:15,577 --> 00:42:16,878
Isn't...

1137
00:42:17,148 --> 00:42:18,688
Isn't today about our love for our team?

1138
00:42:19,347 --> 00:42:20,588
I...

1139
00:42:21,718 --> 00:42:22,887
I will not take any.

1140
00:42:22,887 --> 00:42:25,758
(Does he mean that he won't take any stickers?)

1141
00:42:25,858 --> 00:42:26,988
Everyone, gather around.

1142
00:42:26,988 --> 00:42:28,727
It's time for Team Male Guests to choose.

1143
00:42:29,427 --> 00:42:31,097
I don't think Kwang Soo took all the remaining stickers...

1144
00:42:31,097 --> 00:42:32,898
since he took seven stickers from the previous mission.

1145
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:34,898
I bet he probably took two if he took any.

1146
00:42:34,997 --> 00:42:36,238
I thought about it objectively.

1147
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:37,767
Right now, I have the most stickers.

1148
00:42:38,037 --> 00:42:40,608
If 1 of these 2 guests win,

1149
00:42:40,608 --> 00:42:41,938
they probably are in first place.

1150
00:42:42,508 --> 00:42:44,077
I'm certain Elijah took the most.

1151
00:42:44,577 --> 00:42:45,707
Excuse me.

1152
00:42:45,707 --> 00:42:48,747
Your words just slurred.

1153
00:42:48,747 --> 00:42:49,918
It's because I'm cold.

1154
00:42:50,077 --> 00:42:51,677
- Are you okay? - That's what I think.

1155
00:42:51,677 --> 00:42:53,117
- Yes, I'm okay. - Don't accuse me.

1156
00:42:53,117 --> 00:42:54,747
- Are you all right? - Jae Duck took a lot too,

1157
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,988
- but Elijah took the most. - Wait.

1158
00:42:57,218 --> 00:42:59,327
- Don't say such a thing. - I'm vulnerable to cold weathers.

1159
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,457
(His mouth is frozen.)

1160
00:43:02,327 --> 00:43:04,427
I think it must be either Elijah or Jae Duck.

1161
00:43:04,727 --> 00:43:06,427
Elijah might get greedy about this mission.

1162
00:43:07,227 --> 00:43:08,597
I'm sure she took either 3 or 4.

1163
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:11,807
This is hard even in terms of probability.

1164
00:43:11,938 --> 00:43:13,767
- We have no choice. It's Elijah. - I'm sure she took them.

1165
00:43:13,867 --> 00:43:15,207
- Let's go with Elijah. - No.

1166
00:43:15,207 --> 00:43:16,677
No, I think it's Jae Duck. What about you?

1167
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,738
- Okay. Let's go with Jae Duck then. - I think...

1168
00:43:17,738 --> 00:43:19,648
When he wanted to take the stickers,

1169
00:43:19,648 --> 00:43:22,117
he couldn't take any because Kwang Soo took all of it.

1170
00:43:22,247 --> 00:43:24,548
- Okay. Let's go with Jae Duck. - I think so too.

1171
00:43:24,617 --> 00:43:26,517
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

1172
00:43:26,517 --> 00:43:28,188
- It's Jae Duck. - It's Jae Duck.

1173
00:43:28,457 --> 00:43:33,128
All right. Jae Duck is the member...

1174
00:43:33,188 --> 00:43:37,028
(If Team White is right, all the members will get 1 Fire Sticker, )

1175
00:43:37,028 --> 00:43:41,838
(and Jae Duck's Fire Stickers will be switched with Ice Stickers.)

1176
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:43,037
He has the most Fire Stickers.

1177
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:46,707
(Team White was right.)

1178
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,008
We were right!

1179
00:43:49,008 --> 00:43:51,307
(How did they know?)

1180
00:43:52,108 --> 00:43:55,677
(There were 7 Fire Stickers.)

1181
00:43:55,677 --> 00:43:56,677
(He took them all.)

1182
00:43:56,677 --> 00:43:59,918
Jae Duck took seven Fire Stickers.

1183
00:43:59,918 --> 00:44:01,088
You took seven?

1184
00:44:01,088 --> 00:44:02,818
All of them will be switched with Ice Stickers.

1185
00:44:02,818 --> 00:44:06,358
(All of his 7 Fire Stickers will be switched with Ice Stickers.)

1186
00:44:06,887 --> 00:44:08,387
Ji Hyo.

1187
00:44:09,497 --> 00:44:11,628
Just do what you want.

1188
00:44:12,227 --> 00:44:14,198
(Haha is thinking.)

1189
00:44:14,198 --> 00:44:15,637
Ice Stickers are difficult.

1190
00:44:15,637 --> 00:44:16,767
(Haha takes 2.)

1191
00:44:17,298 --> 00:44:18,338
I'll take...

1192
00:44:18,338 --> 00:44:21,137
(Jong Kook takes 2.)

1193
00:44:22,177 --> 00:44:24,137
(There are 5 Ice Stickers left.)

1194
00:44:24,137 --> 00:44:27,907
(Su Won wants to take all 5?)

1195
00:44:28,878 --> 00:44:32,988
(So Min has nothing to take.)

1196
00:44:34,017 --> 00:44:35,718
(Empty)

1197
00:44:36,688 --> 00:44:37,957
I'm so...

1198
00:44:39,188 --> 00:44:40,588
That's not important.

1199
00:44:40,787 --> 00:44:42,157
This is...

1200
00:44:42,457 --> 00:44:43,997
Team White.

1201
00:44:43,997 --> 00:44:45,927
Team White, please make a decision.

1202
00:44:46,668 --> 00:44:47,727
Let's choose Haha.

1203
00:44:48,068 --> 00:44:49,438
- How many did he take? - One.

1204
00:44:49,438 --> 00:44:50,798
- He took one. - Haha.

1205
00:44:50,798 --> 00:44:52,307
(If they're right, all the members will get one Fire Sticker.)

1206
00:44:52,307 --> 00:44:53,767
1, 2, 3.

1207
00:44:53,767 --> 00:44:55,108
- Haha. - Haha.

1208
00:44:55,108 --> 00:44:57,907
Haha would give one back.

1209
00:44:57,907 --> 00:45:01,677
Haha is not the member who has the least Ice Stickers.

1210
00:45:01,677 --> 00:45:03,017
He isn't?

1211
00:45:03,077 --> 00:45:04,548
- Aren't I amazing? - You are.

1212
00:45:04,548 --> 00:45:06,617
I'm like a mom these days.

1213
00:45:06,617 --> 00:45:08,247
I'm so generous.

1214
00:45:08,517 --> 00:45:10,017
- Who is it then? - Haha has...

1215
00:45:10,418 --> 00:45:12,758
- two. - So Min must have nothing.

1216
00:45:12,758 --> 00:45:14,887
The member with the least Ice Stickers is...

1217
00:45:14,887 --> 00:45:16,727
So Min, who has none.

1218
00:45:16,727 --> 00:45:18,997
We're amazing.

1219
00:45:19,267 --> 00:45:20,597
Wasn't she the last member?

1220
00:45:20,597 --> 00:45:21,997
- Yes. - That's right.

1221
00:45:22,338 --> 00:45:23,668
Su Won took a lot.

1222
00:45:24,198 --> 00:45:26,468
- He took a lot. - Su Won, you're amazing.

1223
00:45:26,468 --> 00:45:29,407
- Su Won... Hold on. - He's amazing.

1224
00:45:29,677 --> 00:45:31,608
Is there something going on?

1225
00:45:31,608 --> 00:45:34,608
(What's going on?)

1226
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:35,648
Hey.

1227
00:45:35,648 --> 00:45:38,048
(So Min wanted Su Won on her team.)

1228
00:45:38,048 --> 00:45:40,688
(Me?)

1229
00:45:40,688 --> 00:45:43,358
(There was something going on from the morning.)

1230
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:46,188
- Right now... - Don't start this.

1231
00:45:46,188 --> 00:45:48,497
- Oh, really? - It's not too late. Do you want it?

1232
00:45:48,497 --> 00:45:50,258
No. I'm fine.

1233
00:45:50,258 --> 00:45:51,427
(Nothing is going on.)

1234
00:45:51,427 --> 00:45:53,227
As a result, all the members of Team White...

1235
00:45:53,227 --> 00:45:55,898
will get 1 Fire Sticker and 1 Ice Sticker.

1236
00:45:56,398 --> 00:45:59,008
Let's go to the next place to have lunch.

1237
00:45:59,008 --> 00:46:00,707
(The members of Team White get 1 Fire Sticker and 1 Ice Sticker.)

1238
00:46:01,668 --> 00:46:06,307
(Ski Jumping Sticker Results)

1239
00:46:07,077 --> 00:46:08,207
(A beef place in Pyeongchang)

1240
00:46:08,207 --> 00:46:09,648
- I see something. - What's that?

1241
00:46:09,648 --> 00:46:10,948
Oh, my.

1242
00:46:12,247 --> 00:46:13,818
- What's that? - Hello.

1243
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:15,418
What's that?

1244
00:46:15,418 --> 00:46:16,918
Look at all the beef.

1245
00:46:17,457 --> 00:46:19,387
I want tenderloin.

1246
00:46:19,387 --> 00:46:20,858
I love yukhoe.

1247
00:46:21,157 --> 00:46:22,758
- Look it's rib-eye. - Rib-eye.

1248
00:46:22,898 --> 00:46:24,727
- That's the best part. - It's crazy.

1249
00:46:24,727 --> 00:46:25,997
- Can we eat them? - Chuck flap tail.

1250
00:46:25,997 --> 00:46:27,767
We could share them.

1251
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:30,398
Look at the marbling. It looks amazing.

1252
00:46:30,398 --> 00:46:31,497
(They're impressed.)

1253
00:46:32,307 --> 00:46:33,468
There's ramyeon too.

1254
00:46:33,637 --> 00:46:35,177
Nurungji ramyeon?

1255
00:46:35,177 --> 00:46:37,307
(Nurungji ramyeon)

1256
00:46:37,438 --> 00:46:39,807
- To be honest, ramyeon is the best. - No, it isn't.

1257
00:46:39,807 --> 00:46:41,247
- What? - Here?

1258
00:46:41,247 --> 00:46:43,218
- Are you serious? - You should eat beef.

1259
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:44,677
- You should eat beef. - You want to eat ramyeon...

1260
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:46,318
- at a beef place? - We don't want to.

1261
00:46:46,448 --> 00:46:47,887
- That rib-eye looks great. - Rib eye.

1262
00:46:48,048 --> 00:46:49,318
Can we eat this too?

1263
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:50,418
So Min.

1264
00:46:50,418 --> 00:46:51,418
I want to eat them.

1265
00:46:51,418 --> 00:46:53,358
(Pyeongchang's specialty, gummy worms)

1266
00:46:53,457 --> 00:46:54,688
Why are there fish-shaped buns?

1267
00:46:54,858 --> 00:46:56,628
- Why are there fish-shaped buns? - There's beef jerky too.

1268
00:46:56,758 --> 00:47:01,198
You'll decide what to have for lunch yourself.

1269
00:47:01,198 --> 00:47:03,798
We slide the stones?

1270
00:47:03,798 --> 00:47:05,407
- Do you see the curling board? - Yes.

1271
00:47:05,407 --> 00:47:06,468
(It's a mini curling board.)

1272
00:47:07,537 --> 00:47:08,537
They're rice bowls.

1273
00:47:08,537 --> 00:47:10,778
(They'll use rice bowls as stones.)

1274
00:47:10,778 --> 00:47:13,948
You'll compete for food and Chance Cards.

1275
00:47:15,378 --> 00:47:17,048
Each rice bowl has a name on it.

1276
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:20,048
You'll have to slide it into the target.

1277
00:47:21,117 --> 00:47:23,418
Depending on where your stone ends up,

1278
00:47:23,418 --> 00:47:27,688
you're lunch menu will be determined.

1279
00:47:28,287 --> 00:47:33,927
If someone's stone ends up on the center of the target,

1280
00:47:34,097 --> 00:47:35,968
he or she can choose what to eat...

1281
00:47:35,968 --> 00:47:40,307
and switch his or her bag with someone else's.

1282
00:47:40,907 --> 00:47:42,278
You can switch your bag with someone else's?

1283
00:47:42,278 --> 00:47:44,407
- Kwang Soo, be careful. - Chance Cards...

1284
00:47:44,407 --> 00:47:45,407
I have just one more sticker.

1285
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,847
Elijah and Kwang Soo...

1286
00:47:46,847 --> 00:47:47,847
You're our targets.

1287
00:47:47,847 --> 00:47:49,577
(Elijah and Kwang Soo, we'll take your stickers away.)

1288
00:47:50,247 --> 00:47:51,718
Gummy worms are the worst.

1289
00:47:51,718 --> 00:47:53,448
- We have to push others' away. - Gummy worms...

1290
00:47:53,718 --> 00:47:56,818
Cheongyang chili and kimchi are the worst.

1291
00:47:56,818 --> 00:47:58,688
What a weird combination.

1292
00:47:58,688 --> 00:48:00,628
- Yukhoe would be fine too. - I like yukhoe.

1293
00:48:00,727 --> 00:48:02,358
Beef jerky... I'm not sure.

1294
00:48:02,427 --> 00:48:03,657
Doenjang jjigae is fine too.

1295
00:48:03,657 --> 00:48:05,468
Garlic and green onion salad is the worst.

1296
00:48:05,568 --> 00:48:07,298
I just want to eat something.

1297
00:48:07,298 --> 00:48:08,327
(I wouldn't mind any food.)

1298
00:48:08,367 --> 00:48:10,198
We should practice.

1299
00:48:10,198 --> 00:48:11,537
It's harder than you think.

1300
00:48:11,537 --> 00:48:12,668
It's not slippery.

1301
00:48:12,668 --> 00:48:14,938
It doesn't slide well.

1302
00:48:14,938 --> 00:48:16,738
- It's not so easy. - It doesn't slide well.

1303
00:48:17,537 --> 00:48:18,778
You have to use a lot of force.

1304
00:48:18,778 --> 00:48:21,407
- Control your strength. - You have to slide it far.

1305
00:48:21,508 --> 00:48:23,318
It might rebound too.

1306
00:48:23,548 --> 00:48:25,188
I want rib-eye.

1307
00:48:25,588 --> 00:48:27,517
I can only reach ramyeon.

1308
00:48:27,517 --> 00:48:29,017
(Rubbing)

1309
00:48:29,017 --> 00:48:32,387
(Please slide far.)

1310
00:48:32,628 --> 00:48:34,387
I'll win the tenderloin.

1311
00:48:34,387 --> 00:48:36,398
(So Min is determined.)

1312
00:48:37,198 --> 00:48:38,497
Rib-eye.

1313
00:48:38,497 --> 00:48:41,327
(Let me show you something.)

1314
00:48:42,398 --> 00:48:44,968
(Ji Won can hit any target he wants.)

1315
00:48:46,907 --> 00:48:48,267
That's how you do it.

1316
00:48:48,367 --> 00:48:49,707
I can hit anything.

1317
00:48:49,778 --> 00:48:50,907
(What's this?)

1318
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:53,807
(He hits it again.)

1319
00:48:53,807 --> 00:48:54,907
I can hit anything.

1320
00:48:54,907 --> 00:48:57,378
Hey, look at this.

1321
00:48:57,378 --> 00:48:58,617
(He could even be on the national curling team.)

1322
00:48:58,617 --> 00:49:01,688
- Look at this. - Gosh.

1323
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:02,758
(He can hit anything.)

1324
00:49:02,758 --> 00:49:04,488
I can hit anything I want.

1325
00:49:05,017 --> 00:49:06,457
Ji Won can hit anything he wants.

1326
00:49:06,457 --> 00:49:07,758
I can hit anything.

1327
00:49:08,497 --> 00:49:11,227
You have only one chance. If it escapes, you don't get a menu.

1328
00:49:11,227 --> 00:49:12,327
- You don't get a menu? - Goodness.

1329
00:49:12,568 --> 00:49:14,798
It's better to go later.

1330
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:15,798
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1331
00:49:15,798 --> 00:49:17,398
The teams will take turns.

1332
00:49:17,398 --> 00:49:18,668
- We'll take turns. - One member from each team...

1333
00:49:18,668 --> 00:49:21,037
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1334
00:49:21,037 --> 00:49:22,037
Let's do that.

1335
00:49:22,037 --> 00:49:24,137
Rock-paper-scissors.

1336
00:49:24,778 --> 00:49:26,008
Okay. Ji Won.

1337
00:49:26,108 --> 00:49:27,177
Ji Won.

1338
00:49:27,177 --> 00:49:28,477
(I have a good feeling.)

1339
00:49:28,477 --> 00:49:29,517
Okay.

1340
00:49:29,517 --> 00:49:30,847
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1341
00:49:31,148 --> 00:49:32,818
- Yes. - Nice.

1342
00:49:32,818 --> 00:49:34,318
- It doesn't matter. - Ji Hyo wins every time.

1343
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:36,957
She always wins.

1344
00:49:36,957 --> 00:49:38,088
Let's go.

1345
00:49:38,088 --> 00:49:39,088
Go, Ji Hyo.

1346
00:49:39,088 --> 00:49:40,287
Number five is not good.

1347
00:49:40,457 --> 00:49:42,497
Take it easy.

1348
00:49:42,497 --> 00:49:44,258
- Use a lot of force. - Slide it far.

1349
00:49:44,657 --> 00:49:46,068
Use a lot of force.

1350
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:47,097
(What will Ji Hyo hit?)

1351
00:49:47,097 --> 00:49:48,427
- Nice. - Nice.

1352
00:49:48,427 --> 00:49:49,738
We don't know yet.

1353
00:49:49,738 --> 00:49:52,508
(Nurungji ramyeon)

1354
00:49:53,707 --> 00:49:55,307
- Someone will push mine anyway. - Yes.

1355
00:49:55,307 --> 00:49:56,537
- Jae Duck. - Second person.

1356
00:49:59,677 --> 00:50:00,747
Ji Hyo will...

1357
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,448
Someone will probably push hers forward.

1358
00:50:02,448 --> 00:50:03,778
It's the perfect spot.

1359
00:50:03,778 --> 00:50:04,918
I don't have to push Ji Hyo's, right?

1360
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,117
No.

1361
00:50:06,117 --> 00:50:07,287
Don't push hers.

1362
00:50:07,287 --> 00:50:08,688
Let's see.

1363
00:50:08,688 --> 00:50:11,088
- Hit the side like pool. - I want a Chance Card.

1364
00:50:11,088 --> 00:50:13,358
Aim for right in front of the camera.

1365
00:50:14,457 --> 00:50:16,097
- Just do it. - It's okay.

1366
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:18,128
(His stone slides towards the center.)

1367
00:50:18,698 --> 00:50:21,327
- A Chance Card? - Rib-eye?

1368
00:50:22,137 --> 00:50:24,537
(Rib-eye)

1369
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:31,037
(He can already taste the rib-eye.)

1370
00:50:31,878 --> 00:50:33,448
(Team White's Ji Won)

1371
00:50:33,448 --> 00:50:34,707
I'll hit Jae Duck's.

1372
00:50:34,707 --> 00:50:36,577
Push Jae Duck's away.

1373
00:50:38,048 --> 00:50:42,287
(Ji Won shows off amazing skills during practice.)

1374
00:50:43,557 --> 00:50:46,688
- Ji Won is amazing. - I can hit anything.

1375
00:50:46,688 --> 00:50:47,758
(Let me aim for the rib-eye.)

1376
00:50:47,758 --> 00:50:48,997
I'll hit Jae Duck's.

1377
00:50:48,997 --> 00:50:50,758
Push Jae Duck's away.

1378
00:50:50,758 --> 00:50:52,628
Hit both Ji Hyo's and Jae Duck's.

1379
00:50:52,628 --> 00:50:54,068
- Hit them both. - No.

1380
00:50:54,068 --> 00:50:55,068
Like when you play pool.

1381
00:50:55,468 --> 00:50:56,867
I think he'll do a good job.

1382
00:50:58,738 --> 00:51:02,778
(Like a sniper, Ji Won aims for the rib-eye.)

1383
00:51:04,438 --> 00:51:07,677
(He slides his stone carefully.)

1384
00:51:08,577 --> 00:51:13,588
(Will his stone hit the rib-eye?)

1385
00:51:15,688 --> 00:51:17,758
- Out! - Out!

1386
00:51:20,258 --> 00:51:22,827
(It did hit Ji Hyo's stone, )

1387
00:51:22,827 --> 00:51:27,827
(but it went out of the board.)

1388
00:51:28,997 --> 00:51:31,367
(He used too much power.)

1389
00:51:31,367 --> 00:51:34,068
(His stone flies over Pyeongchang.)

1390
00:51:34,168 --> 00:51:37,108
(The rice bowl lid has been launched successfully.)

1391
00:51:41,778 --> 00:51:43,278
It's out.

1392
00:51:43,278 --> 00:51:46,517
- He was too greedy. - Ji Won's out.

1393
00:51:46,648 --> 00:51:49,457
- What should he do? - He was too greedy.

1394
00:51:49,758 --> 00:51:51,318
- Whose turn is it? - Good luck.

1395
00:51:51,318 --> 00:51:52,927
It's my turn. It doesn't slide well.

1396
00:51:54,657 --> 00:51:56,398
Aim for chuck flap tail.

1397
00:51:57,298 --> 00:51:58,798
Aim for chuck flap tail.

1398
00:52:00,427 --> 00:52:01,497
Come here.

1399
00:52:01,497 --> 00:52:05,037
(He can hear the beef grilling.)

1400
00:52:07,307 --> 00:52:09,077
- Nice. - No!

1401
00:52:09,407 --> 00:52:11,438
- Nice. - No!

1402
00:52:11,438 --> 00:52:13,307
- Yukhoe. - Yukhoe.

1403
00:52:13,307 --> 00:52:15,008
I prefer grilled beef.

1404
00:52:16,017 --> 00:52:17,347
(I want grilled beef.)

1405
00:52:17,347 --> 00:52:20,017
- Grill your yukhoe. - You can grill it.

1406
00:52:20,948 --> 00:52:22,588
Jae Duck still has the rib-eye.

1407
00:52:22,758 --> 00:52:24,057
- Nice. - Good luck.

1408
00:52:24,088 --> 00:52:25,787
- Soyou. - Here we go.

1409
00:52:25,787 --> 00:52:27,258
- Just slide it. - Aim for beef.

1410
00:52:27,457 --> 00:52:29,298
- Rib-eye and a Chance Card. - Tenderloin.

1411
00:52:30,327 --> 00:52:31,427
Yukhoe is nice.

1412
00:52:35,338 --> 00:52:36,767
Don't distract her.

1413
00:52:36,767 --> 00:52:40,307
(They're distracting her by singing her song.)

1414
00:52:41,707 --> 00:52:46,247
(The beef will be as soft as her voice.)

1415
00:52:46,807 --> 00:52:48,617
Gosh! Ramyeon.

1416
00:52:50,378 --> 00:52:51,887
- I like it. - I like it.

1417
00:52:51,887 --> 00:52:53,818
- Ramyeon. - That's nice.

1418
00:52:54,847 --> 00:52:57,688
(She sounds like Jeon In Kwon.)

1419
00:52:57,688 --> 00:52:59,727
I didn't know Soyou could sound like that.

1420
00:53:01,258 --> 00:53:02,528
I was so shocked.

1421
00:53:02,927 --> 00:53:04,298
(Screaming)

1422
00:53:04,957 --> 00:53:06,097
(Embarrassed)

1423
00:53:06,597 --> 00:53:09,298
Let's give up on food.

1424
00:53:09,298 --> 00:53:10,968
Let's just push all the stones away.

1425
00:53:10,968 --> 00:53:12,407
I can't push them away well.

1426
00:53:12,407 --> 00:53:13,508
(It's Jae Seok's turn.)

1427
00:53:13,508 --> 00:53:14,738
It's hard.

1428
00:53:14,807 --> 00:53:16,977
They're blocking the way.

1429
00:53:17,637 --> 00:53:19,207
They're in the way.

1430
00:53:20,148 --> 00:53:21,577
(Trusting the other members, )

1431
00:53:21,577 --> 00:53:28,088
(he wants to push away all the other team's stones.)

1432
00:53:29,057 --> 00:53:32,988
(Will Ji Won and Jae Seok's teamwork bring success?)

1433
00:53:33,488 --> 00:53:34,887
- Gosh. - What have you done?

1434
00:53:34,887 --> 00:53:36,727
- Gosh. - What have you done?

1435
00:53:36,727 --> 00:53:37,898
(He gets garlic and seasoned spring onions.)

1436
00:53:37,898 --> 00:53:40,427
All right. Good job.

1437
00:53:41,497 --> 00:53:42,497
What have you done?

1438
00:53:42,497 --> 00:53:45,968
(At least it's red like meat.)

1439
00:53:45,968 --> 00:53:47,968
- Seasoned spring onions? - I'm jealous.

1440
00:53:47,968 --> 00:53:49,108
Wait a minute.

1441
00:53:49,108 --> 00:53:51,477
- Listen to me. - This would have been better.

1442
00:53:51,477 --> 00:53:53,508
- How could you? - When you eat...

1443
00:53:53,508 --> 00:53:55,577
When you eat meat, you need garlic and seasoned spring onions.

1444
00:53:55,577 --> 00:53:59,188
- We didn't win meat. - We'll win.

1445
00:53:59,188 --> 00:54:01,287
This is humiliating. An out is better than this.

1446
00:54:01,287 --> 00:54:04,188
It'd be perfect if Se Chan gets Cheongyang chili.

1447
00:54:05,188 --> 00:54:07,057
We'll get a stomachache if we eat this.

1448
00:54:07,057 --> 00:54:08,188
We'll die.

1449
00:54:08,188 --> 00:54:09,597
You should win meat.

1450
00:54:09,597 --> 00:54:11,628
- We should try to get gummy worms. - Is it our turn?

1451
00:54:11,628 --> 00:54:13,327
- Go ahead. - Let's go.

1452
00:54:13,398 --> 00:54:15,438
- If So Min pushes the others... - We'd lose.

1453
00:54:15,438 --> 00:54:17,698
- Good luck. - Do well. That's right.

1454
00:54:17,698 --> 00:54:19,367
Here she goes.

1455
00:54:19,367 --> 00:54:20,367
(Her lid approaches.)

1456
00:54:21,608 --> 00:54:24,778
(She wins a bowl of ramyeon.)

1457
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:28,878
Why is everyone blocking?

1458
00:54:28,878 --> 00:54:30,278
- It's blocked. - That's good.

1459
00:54:30,278 --> 00:54:32,188
- That's a relief. - It could have been better.

1460
00:54:32,188 --> 00:54:34,148
Is everyone helping out Jae Duck?

1461
00:54:34,617 --> 00:54:37,188
The next person should get garlic and seasoned spring onions.

1462
00:54:37,188 --> 00:54:38,488
- Next is Kwang Soo. - Go.

1463
00:54:38,488 --> 00:54:39,488
Okay.

1464
00:54:39,488 --> 00:54:40,488
(Next up is Kwang Soo.)

1465
00:54:40,628 --> 00:54:42,957
- Don't move ours, okay? - Okay.

1466
00:54:42,997 --> 00:54:45,497
Kwang Soo, you should hit Soyou's.

1467
00:54:45,497 --> 00:54:49,497
- I want to eat at least a piece. - You should hit Soyou's.

1468
00:54:49,497 --> 00:54:50,968
You can't go in the field.

1469
00:54:50,968 --> 00:54:52,508
Wait a minute.

1470
00:54:52,508 --> 00:54:53,508
Don't go in the field.

1471
00:54:53,608 --> 00:54:55,738
Think of this as the Olympics. We're in Pyeongchang after all.

1472
00:54:56,907 --> 00:54:58,977
(He becomes speechless.)

1473
00:54:58,977 --> 00:55:00,707
- Goodness. - He's really upset.

1474
00:55:00,707 --> 00:55:02,548
He was being serious.

1475
00:55:02,617 --> 00:55:03,878
It's impossible to win meat.

1476
00:55:03,878 --> 00:55:06,588
- Kwang Soo. - You should approach here.

1477
00:55:06,588 --> 00:55:07,588
Will it bounce off?

1478
00:55:07,588 --> 00:55:09,157
You should get doenjang jjigae.

1479
00:55:09,157 --> 00:55:11,088
- Kwang Soo, hit Soyou's. - Go this way.

1480
00:55:11,088 --> 00:55:13,557
- If not... - If you hit Soyou's,

1481
00:55:13,858 --> 00:55:16,298
you can win a Chance Card and the rib-eye.

1482
00:55:16,497 --> 00:55:19,427
You should hit Soyou's. Don't you want to be a star?

1483
00:55:19,468 --> 00:55:20,497
A star?

1484
00:55:20,497 --> 00:55:22,267
I'll make you a star.

1485
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,668
Hit all three of them out.

1486
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:25,968
We're on the same team.

1487
00:55:25,968 --> 00:55:28,907
Let's share some rib-eye.

1488
00:55:28,907 --> 00:55:29,907
We can eat some at least.

1489
00:55:29,907 --> 00:55:31,278
- Think carefully, Kwang Soo. - No.

1490
00:55:31,278 --> 00:55:32,778
- You should win. - This is right.

1491
00:55:32,778 --> 00:55:34,407
Do what best suits you.

1492
00:55:34,407 --> 00:55:36,718
It's best to hit Soyou's.

1493
00:55:37,477 --> 00:55:39,287
(He's more serious than ever.)

1494
00:55:39,287 --> 00:55:41,588
(He concentrates like a national athlete.)

1495
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,787
(While everyone's attention is on him...)

1496
00:55:43,787 --> 00:55:45,688
- Push toward the left. - How about this?

1497
00:55:45,688 --> 00:55:48,057
Can I approach the middle and win a Chance Card?

1498
00:55:48,057 --> 00:55:50,457
- It's hard to get through. - You should stay in the circle.

1499
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:52,927
- It might bounce off. - It's completely possible.

1500
00:55:53,468 --> 00:55:54,867
- Is it? - Did you take your turn?

1501
00:55:54,867 --> 00:55:57,168
- Didn't you take your turn? - What?

1502
00:55:57,168 --> 00:56:00,008
(There's no such thing as practice.)

1503
00:56:00,008 --> 00:56:02,008
- He already went. - He did it.

1504
00:56:02,008 --> 00:56:03,177
- Didn't he go? - Didn't he?

1505
00:56:03,177 --> 00:56:04,907
- That was short. - He went.

1506
00:56:04,907 --> 00:56:06,608
- Come on. - You already went.

1507
00:56:06,608 --> 00:56:08,548
- It's over. - He already went.

1508
00:56:08,847 --> 00:56:10,577
- No way. - Get out of the way.

1509
00:56:10,577 --> 00:56:13,318
- Get out of the way. - How is this possible?

1510
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:14,347
(Sighing)

1511
00:56:14,347 --> 00:56:15,957
- I didn't. - He had his chance.

1512
00:56:15,957 --> 00:56:17,287
That doesn't count.

1513
00:56:17,287 --> 00:56:19,157
- It does count. - As soon as you let it go.

1514
00:56:19,157 --> 00:56:20,628
- Good job. - Where are we?

1515
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:21,798
- We're in Pyeongchang. - Right.

1516
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:23,327
We must play fair.

1517
00:56:23,327 --> 00:56:24,457
You must play fair.

1518
00:56:24,457 --> 00:56:26,727
I forgot that we're in Pyeongchang. I'm so silly.

1519
00:56:26,727 --> 00:56:27,727
You're silly.

1520
00:56:28,398 --> 00:56:29,438
Who's next?

1521
00:56:29,867 --> 00:56:31,537
- Is it the end? - Yes.

1522
00:56:31,537 --> 00:56:33,508
Pyeongchang is all about being fair.

1523
00:56:33,867 --> 00:56:34,867
(Lost for words)

1524
00:56:34,867 --> 00:56:36,807
- We're in Pyeongchang. - Good job.

1525
00:56:36,807 --> 00:56:38,438
- That's it. - We're next.

1526
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:40,577
Remember that we get no practice. Play right away.

1527
00:56:40,577 --> 00:56:41,677
- It's Sung Hoon. - Sung Hoon.

1528
00:56:41,677 --> 00:56:42,718
- Is he next? - Come, Sung Hoon.

1529
00:56:42,718 --> 00:56:43,878
It's over once you let it go.

1530
00:56:43,878 --> 00:56:45,287
He'll do well.

1531
00:56:45,287 --> 00:56:46,718
- Sung Hoon is good. - Give it a try.

1532
00:56:46,718 --> 00:56:48,418
- This is rather difficult. - He's not bad.

1533
00:56:48,588 --> 00:56:49,988
- Give it a try. - Push it hard.

1534
00:56:53,988 --> 00:56:54,988
My goodness.

1535
00:56:55,198 --> 00:56:56,898
(Gummy worms)

1536
00:56:58,097 --> 00:57:00,267
(They win garlic, seasoned spring onions, and gummy worms.)

1537
00:57:00,267 --> 00:57:02,468
- It's gummy worms. - He blocked it.

1538
00:57:02,468 --> 00:57:04,468
- It's completely blocked. - He blocked it.

1539
00:57:04,468 --> 00:57:06,468
(He helped block the rib-eye.)

1540
00:57:06,468 --> 00:57:07,707
It's blocked.

1541
00:57:07,707 --> 00:57:09,807
- That was good. - We should hit it this way.

1542
00:57:09,807 --> 00:57:11,108
How can we get through?

1543
00:57:11,108 --> 00:57:12,108
What should we do?

1544
00:57:12,108 --> 00:57:14,378
I bet Su Won will get through.

1545
00:57:15,177 --> 00:57:17,517
- Look. - It was too short.

1546
00:57:18,148 --> 00:57:20,448
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

1547
00:57:20,448 --> 00:57:22,318
- Good job. - Are you okay?

1548
00:57:22,488 --> 00:57:23,657
Did you get hurt?

1549
00:57:24,287 --> 00:57:25,787
- Next is Elijah. - It's Elijah.

1550
00:57:25,787 --> 00:57:27,887
- Let's go. - Her pose looks professional?

1551
00:57:27,887 --> 00:57:29,198
What will it be?

1552
00:57:29,997 --> 00:57:31,597
- Look at her pose. - What is it?

1553
00:57:31,597 --> 00:57:32,898
(It went too far.)

1554
00:57:32,898 --> 00:57:34,867
That's a home run.

1555
00:57:34,867 --> 00:57:37,168
What happened? Where did you aim?

1556
00:57:37,198 --> 00:57:39,668
- I don't know. - She was too greedy.

1557
00:57:41,068 --> 00:57:42,878
I should hit the others.

1558
00:57:43,477 --> 00:57:44,508
- Try to hit them. - No way.

1559
00:57:44,508 --> 00:57:46,247
- If you cross... - He let it go.

1560
00:57:46,247 --> 00:57:48,247
- He let it go. - Okay.

1561
00:57:48,278 --> 00:57:49,948
- Everyone is so sensitive. - It doesn't count.

1562
00:57:49,948 --> 00:57:51,378
- Everyone is sensitive. - You could lose your chance.

1563
00:57:51,378 --> 00:57:52,718
- I understand. - It's over...

1564
00:57:52,718 --> 00:57:54,088
- if it goes up. - Okay.

1565
00:57:54,088 --> 00:57:56,218
- Good job. - Don't be so nasty.

1566
00:57:56,387 --> 00:57:57,718
- 8, 7. - Stop counting.

1567
00:57:57,718 --> 00:57:59,887
- It makes me nervous. Stop it. - 6, 5.

1568
00:57:59,887 --> 00:58:03,057
- 4, 3, 2, 1. - 4, 3, 2, 1.

1569
00:58:04,628 --> 00:58:07,028
- He gets gummy worms. - It's gummy worms.

1570
00:58:07,367 --> 00:58:09,497
Eating gummy worms in this cold weather will break our jaw.

1571
00:58:09,497 --> 00:58:10,898
(They get two bags of gummy worms and seasoned spring onions.)

1572
00:58:10,898 --> 00:58:11,907
My goodness.

1573
00:58:12,407 --> 00:58:13,738
- We're almost there. - My goodness.

1574
00:58:13,738 --> 00:58:14,738
Come on.

1575
00:58:15,677 --> 00:58:16,707
(Jong Kook is next.)

1576
00:58:16,707 --> 00:58:18,847
- Please win meat, Jong Kook. - Win meat.

1577
00:58:18,847 --> 00:58:20,347
(Jong Kook, please win meat.)

1578
00:58:20,347 --> 00:58:22,448
- Please win meat, Jong Kook. - 5, 4.

1579
00:58:22,448 --> 00:58:24,448
(Yukhoe and ramyeon are only side dishes.)

1580
00:58:24,448 --> 00:58:28,247
(Let's win some grilled meat.)

1581
00:58:28,247 --> 00:58:29,258
Two.

1582
00:58:29,688 --> 00:58:31,588
(Get through the other lids.)

1583
00:58:33,057 --> 00:58:34,057
Two.

1584
00:58:34,787 --> 00:58:37,497
(His strength made something bounce off.)

1585
00:58:39,097 --> 00:58:40,968
(Jong Kook is out.)

1586
00:58:40,968 --> 00:58:43,997
(Sung Hoon moves to the rib-eye instead.)

1587
00:58:43,997 --> 00:58:46,907
(Jae Duck moves from the rib-eye to beef jerky.)

1588
00:58:46,907 --> 00:58:48,307
Did Jae Duck land on the Chance Card?

1589
00:58:48,307 --> 00:58:49,807
- What happened? - It's beef jerky.

1590
00:58:49,807 --> 00:58:51,438
- It moved to the beef jerky. - It's beef jerky.

1591
00:58:51,438 --> 00:58:52,778
It's beef jerky.

1592
00:58:52,778 --> 00:58:54,378
- Sung Hoon. - No way.

1593
00:58:54,378 --> 00:58:58,318
(He lost the rib-eye and ends up with beef jerky.)

1594
00:59:00,088 --> 00:59:01,957
(Team White wins the rib-eye.)

1595
00:59:01,957 --> 00:59:03,858
- We got the rib-eye. - My goodness.

1596
00:59:03,858 --> 00:59:05,887
- What happened? - We got it.

1597
00:59:06,188 --> 00:59:07,188
Am I out?

1598
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:08,497
- Look. - Am I out?

1599
00:59:08,497 --> 00:59:10,698
- Rib-eye, rib-eye. - Rib-eye, rib-eye.

1600
00:59:10,698 --> 00:59:12,528
That was so accurate.

1601
00:59:12,528 --> 00:59:14,198
- Jong Kook did it. - This is crazy.

1602
00:59:14,198 --> 00:59:16,798
- It's because of Jong Kook. - Jong Kook.

1603
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:18,568
(There's loss and victory.)

1604
00:59:18,568 --> 00:59:20,168
- We got rib-eye. - Rib-eye?

1605
00:59:20,367 --> 00:59:22,037
- I can't believe it. - I'm jealous.

1606
00:59:22,108 --> 00:59:24,438
Garlic and seasoned spring onions will be useful in the end.

1607
00:59:25,508 --> 00:59:27,347
I just need a Chance Card.

1608
00:59:27,347 --> 00:59:28,378
- It won't be easy. - This is sad.

1609
00:59:28,378 --> 00:59:29,778
- It's possible. - It is.

1610
00:59:29,778 --> 00:59:31,517
- Go on. - Try it.

1611
00:59:31,517 --> 00:59:33,448
- This is incredible. - Give it a try.

1612
00:59:33,448 --> 00:59:36,419
It'd be incredible if he hits mine into tenderloin.

1613
00:59:37,589 --> 00:59:39,158
- Where did it land? - It'd be incredible...

1614
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:40,859
if he hits mine into tenderloin.

1615
00:59:41,299 --> 00:59:45,999
(It hits Jae Seok's and lands on tenderloin.)

1616
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,468
Is it tenderloin?

1617
00:59:47,468 --> 00:59:48,468
It's tenderloin.

1618
00:59:49,269 --> 00:59:50,908
- Where did it land? - It's tenderloin.

1619
00:59:50,908 --> 00:59:54,508
(Seok Jin wins tenderloin and becomes a hero.)

1620
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:55,539
He won tenderloin.

1621
00:59:55,638 --> 00:59:57,109
Our team is so lucky today.

1622
00:59:57,879 --> 01:00:00,178
I knew it was possible.

1623
01:00:00,178 --> 01:00:02,178
- Is Jae Jin the last player? - Yes.

1624
01:00:02,178 --> 01:00:04,988
Just avoid moving the rib-eye anywhere.

1625
01:00:04,988 --> 01:00:06,149
It should land here.

1626
01:00:06,589 --> 01:00:08,689
Jae Jin won't go easy.

1627
01:00:08,689 --> 01:00:09,888
He'll turn the tables.

1628
01:00:09,888 --> 01:00:10,959
He'll make it fun.

1629
01:00:10,959 --> 01:00:12,729
Do your best, Jae Jin.

1630
01:00:14,258 --> 01:00:18,899
(Where will his unpredictable lid land?)

1631
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:28,638
(He hits Jae Seok's out of garlic and seasoned spring onions.)

1632
01:00:32,578 --> 01:00:33,948
- My goodness. - Yes.

1633
01:00:33,948 --> 01:00:36,979
(He pushes out Seok Jin's and takes tenderloin.)

1634
01:00:37,689 --> 01:00:42,988
(Team White wins rib-eye, tenderloin, and spring onions.)

1635
01:00:42,988 --> 01:00:43,988
That was amazing.

1636
01:00:44,289 --> 01:00:46,189
- We won. - What happened?

1637
01:00:46,189 --> 01:00:47,459
He got lettuce and ssamjang.

1638
01:00:47,459 --> 01:00:48,528
He did it!

1639
01:00:48,528 --> 01:00:49,828
Lettuce and ssamjang.

1640
01:00:50,058 --> 01:00:51,499
It happened as they said.

1641
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:54,569
- It happened as they said. - We still have the flap steak.

1642
01:00:54,569 --> 01:00:56,069
We only won beef jerky.

1643
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,738
We won tenderloin, rib-eye, and seasoned spring onions.

1644
01:00:58,109 --> 01:01:00,008
Seasoned spring onions was a good choice.

1645
01:01:00,008 --> 01:01:01,508
It happened as they hoped.

1646
01:01:01,508 --> 01:01:03,339
- It's a miracle. - It is.

1647
01:01:03,339 --> 01:01:06,578
Team White wins garlic, seasoned spring onions,

1648
01:01:06,578 --> 01:01:09,379
- Gummy worms. - tenderloin, rib-eye,

1649
01:01:09,379 --> 01:01:11,488
- And gummy worms. - and gummy worms.

1650
01:01:11,488 --> 01:01:12,519
We won tenderloin too.

1651
01:01:12,789 --> 01:01:15,718
- Team Black wins seasoned raw beef. - Seasoned raw beef?

1652
01:01:15,988 --> 01:01:19,289
- We get two ramyeons. - That's right.

1653
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:20,359
That's unfortunate.

1654
01:01:20,359 --> 01:01:22,229
- Team Grey wins beef jerky, - Beef jerky.

1655
01:01:22,698 --> 01:01:25,428
- Lettuce and ssamjang. - lettuce, ssamjang, and ramyeon.

1656
01:01:25,428 --> 01:01:27,569
Let's add lettuce, ssamjang, and beef jerky in the ramyeon.

1657
01:01:27,569 --> 01:01:28,598
Let's do that.

1658
01:01:29,399 --> 01:01:31,968
We'll bring the food accordingly.

1659
01:01:31,968 --> 01:01:35,008
(They move to the table.)

1660
01:01:36,178 --> 01:01:38,948
- The color is beautiful. - It smells amazing.

1661
01:01:38,979 --> 01:01:41,549
Eat it with seasoned spring onions.

1662
01:01:41,578 --> 01:01:42,578
Let's eat.

1663
01:01:42,578 --> 01:01:44,319
(A bite of Korean beef and seasoned spring onions)

1664
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,019
The ramyeon looks delicious.

1665
01:01:48,689 --> 01:01:49,819
That team...

1666
01:01:50,789 --> 01:01:51,959
Even the ssamjang is good.

1667
01:01:52,359 --> 01:01:55,028
(She's imagining that it's good.)

1668
01:01:55,198 --> 01:01:56,299
He had some.

1669
01:01:56,299 --> 01:01:57,428
I'll give this to Kwang Soo.

1670
01:01:57,428 --> 01:01:58,868
Kwang Soo, here's some tendon.

1671
01:01:58,868 --> 01:02:00,129
(He takes care of Kwang Soo.)

1672
01:02:00,129 --> 01:02:02,539
(Give it to me.)

1673
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:05,609
(He's upset.)

1674
01:02:08,738 --> 01:02:10,039
What is wrong with you?

1675
01:02:10,379 --> 01:02:11,379
What's this?

1676
01:02:11,778 --> 01:02:12,948
It's garlic.

1677
01:02:13,078 --> 01:02:15,479
It was for Kwang Soo. Why did you eat it?

1678
01:02:15,479 --> 01:02:16,819
(It was garlic for Kwang Soo.)

1679
01:02:17,549 --> 01:02:22,558
(A second ago, he was dipping the garlic in sauce.)

1680
01:02:22,959 --> 01:02:26,058
(Jae Seok took the bait instead.)

1681
01:02:26,459 --> 01:02:28,328
I dipped garlic in sauce for Kwang Soo.

1682
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:29,629
Why did you eat it?

1683
01:02:30,428 --> 01:02:32,299
He took that from him.

1684
01:02:32,299 --> 01:02:34,698
- Goodness. - You shouldn't be so greedy.

1685
01:02:34,698 --> 01:02:36,169
- Was I being greedy? - It was...

1686
01:02:36,269 --> 01:02:37,769
just a piece of tendon.

1687
01:02:38,709 --> 01:02:41,039
You took it from me. It smells.

1688
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:43,308
(You can't cheat in Pyeongchang.)

1689
01:02:43,308 --> 01:02:46,348
(The final mission will be held in a resort in Gangwon Province.)

1690
01:02:46,948 --> 01:02:48,448
(What is the final mission here?)

1691
01:02:48,448 --> 01:02:49,749
(Sixth Sense Board of Fate)

1692
01:02:49,749 --> 01:02:51,919
- What's this? - Is there a chance to win?

1693
01:02:51,919 --> 01:02:53,249
(Running Man's Loyal Pick)

1694
01:02:53,448 --> 01:02:55,959
- All right. The final mission... - Yes.

1695
01:02:56,118 --> 01:02:57,888
Is Sixth Sense Board of Fate.

1696
01:02:58,058 --> 01:02:59,129
Sixth Sense Board of Fate?

1697
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,028
Sixth Sense?

1698
01:03:01,698 --> 01:03:03,499
- Gosh. - What's that?

1699
01:03:03,729 --> 01:03:05,999
"All pass", "all consistent", "all inconsistent".

1700
01:03:06,129 --> 01:03:09,999
Each team gets to choose one category...

1701
01:03:09,999 --> 01:03:12,508
from "all pass", "all consistent", or "all inconsistent".

1702
01:03:12,669 --> 01:03:16,808
Once you check the mission, you can bet up to 10 stickers.

1703
01:03:17,709 --> 01:03:20,278
If you win, you get the number of Fire Stickers you bet,

1704
01:03:20,278 --> 01:03:23,479
and if you lose, you get Ice Stickers.

1705
01:03:24,149 --> 01:03:28,419
The stickers you win go on the boxes of the Sixth Sense Board of Fate.

1706
01:03:28,689 --> 01:03:31,229
You can discuss amongst your team and see if you will distribute...

1707
01:03:31,229 --> 01:03:32,758
the stickers in one box or over multiple boxes.

1708
01:03:32,758 --> 01:03:36,399
The opposing team will put the stickers on the boxes randomly.

1709
01:03:36,399 --> 01:03:40,198
(The opposing team will put the distributed stickers as they want.)

1710
01:03:40,468 --> 01:03:42,539
Once that's been done, each person chooses a number...

1711
01:03:42,539 --> 01:03:44,908
and obtain the stickers in that box.

1712
01:03:45,808 --> 01:03:47,169
Why are there six boxes?

1713
01:03:47,169 --> 01:03:48,839
Why do we need six?

1714
01:03:49,178 --> 01:03:51,508
For example, if you want two stickers in each box,

1715
01:03:51,508 --> 01:03:53,348
- one box will be empty. - Right.

1716
01:03:53,348 --> 01:03:55,919
We gave you six boxes so that you can choose wisely.

1717
01:03:56,049 --> 01:03:58,419
For example, what happens if you put all stickers in box five?

1718
01:03:58,549 --> 01:04:00,189
The person who chooses five gets all the stickers.

1719
01:04:00,919 --> 01:04:02,118
We get to choose.

1720
01:04:02,118 --> 01:04:04,359
We choose a number from here.

1721
01:04:04,359 --> 01:04:07,289
- This game is not team-based. - I get it.

1722
01:04:07,289 --> 01:04:09,158
- We get a chance to win. - We should put it in one box.

1723
01:04:09,258 --> 01:04:10,828
This is scary.

1724
01:04:10,828 --> 01:04:12,098
(Anybody can win, and anybody can lose.)

1725
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:14,198
(Team Gray chooses "all pass", Black chooses "all inconsistent", )

1726
01:04:14,198 --> 01:04:15,368
(and Team White chooses "all consistent".)

1727
01:04:16,098 --> 01:04:17,669
- Let's start with Team Gray. - Okay.

1728
01:04:18,539 --> 01:04:20,738
"All pass". Let's see.

1729
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:23,178
I think this is okay.

1730
01:04:23,178 --> 01:04:24,379
(What is Team Gray's mission?)

1731
01:04:24,649 --> 01:04:27,749
(Group jump rope)

1732
01:04:28,419 --> 01:04:30,019
- Okay. - Yes.

1733
01:04:30,019 --> 01:04:31,848
- We can do this. - We've done this.

1734
01:04:31,848 --> 01:04:33,348
- We can do this. - How many?

1735
01:04:33,348 --> 01:04:35,118
- I'll hold the rope. - I'm confident.

1736
01:04:35,618 --> 01:04:38,189
Everybody, there are two versions...

1737
01:04:38,189 --> 01:04:39,689
- you can choose from. - Okay.

1738
01:04:39,689 --> 01:04:42,359
If our referees hold the rope, the 5 of you have to jump 30 times.

1739
01:04:42,758 --> 01:04:45,468
If you want to hold the rope, the 3 of you have to jump 50 times.

1740
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:47,569
- 50? It's a lot. - No.

1741
01:04:47,799 --> 01:04:49,468
Let's have the referees hold the rope and do 30.

1742
01:04:49,698 --> 01:04:50,799
No, no.

1743
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,609
Seok Jin can't jump more than 20 times.

1744
01:04:52,609 --> 01:04:54,109
(We can't do that.)

1745
01:04:54,109 --> 01:04:56,609
Is that right? Then should 2 people hold the rope and 3 jump?

1746
01:04:57,749 --> 01:04:59,109
You have to do five people.

1747
01:04:59,109 --> 01:05:00,609
30 times with 5 people is perfect.

1748
01:05:00,609 --> 01:05:02,649
- Let's do that. Let's go, Seok Jin. - There you go.

1749
01:05:02,718 --> 01:05:03,979
- Because... - Don't listen to him.

1750
01:05:03,979 --> 01:05:05,049
50 is too many.

1751
01:05:05,049 --> 01:05:06,488
- You should do 30 times. - And...

1752
01:05:06,618 --> 01:05:08,758
Seok Jin can't spin the rope 50 times.

1753
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:11,558
(They'll bet 10 stickers and skip the rope 30 times.)

1754
01:05:11,558 --> 01:05:13,058
- Ready. - We are ready.

1755
01:05:13,229 --> 01:05:14,399
Ready.

1756
01:05:14,598 --> 01:05:17,058
- You all have to pass. - Can we practice?

1757
01:05:17,058 --> 01:05:18,428
No, you can't. It's 30 times.

1758
01:05:18,528 --> 01:05:20,698
- Please be good to us. - Set,

1759
01:05:21,238 --> 01:05:22,839
- go. - Soyou is going first?

1760
01:05:22,839 --> 01:05:24,468
(The counting starts once all five of them are in.)

1761
01:05:28,839 --> 01:05:32,479
(Soyou has a lot of pressure because she's going first.)

1762
01:05:32,479 --> 01:05:33,848
Good job.

1763
01:05:34,678 --> 01:05:36,479
(She admires Soyou.)

1764
01:05:36,618 --> 01:05:38,019
- We don't know yet. - She's good.

1765
01:05:39,019 --> 01:05:40,988
- It's fast. - It's too fast.

1766
01:05:40,988 --> 01:05:42,519
Go in, Jae Duck.

1767
01:05:42,519 --> 01:05:43,819
(Jae Duck is very agile.)

1768
01:05:43,819 --> 01:05:45,359
Move up. You have to move up.

1769
01:05:46,289 --> 01:05:47,388
It's looking good.

1770
01:05:47,558 --> 01:05:49,928
- They're good. - They can do 30.

1771
01:05:50,058 --> 01:05:51,198
(At this rate, 30 is not a problem.)

1772
01:05:51,198 --> 01:05:52,299
They can do 30.

1773
01:05:53,669 --> 01:05:54,769
- What happened? - What happened?

1774
01:05:57,669 --> 01:06:01,078
(Kwang Soo...)

1775
01:06:01,078 --> 01:06:03,879
(did it again.)

1776
01:06:03,979 --> 01:06:05,678
- Hold on. - No, this...

1777
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:07,408
- Let's laugh. - I didn't mean to.

1778
01:06:07,408 --> 01:06:08,718
(Let's play some music.)

1779
01:06:08,718 --> 01:06:09,919
It's over.

1780
01:06:09,919 --> 01:06:12,189
- You're so unathletic. - I didn't mean to.

1781
01:06:12,189 --> 01:06:14,089
- I got the timing wrong. - I'm so tired.

1782
01:06:14,189 --> 01:06:15,819
- I'm serious. - 50 is hard.

1783
01:06:16,689 --> 01:06:18,428
- Okay, everybody. - Sir.

1784
01:06:18,428 --> 01:06:20,359
Please give us another chance.

1785
01:06:20,359 --> 01:06:22,198
- Let's give them another chance. - Thank you.

1786
01:06:22,198 --> 01:06:23,499
One more chance.

1787
01:06:23,499 --> 01:06:26,468
Go in once the rope hits the floor.

1788
01:06:26,468 --> 01:06:28,138
- Okay. - Go in after it hits the floor.

1789
01:06:28,839 --> 01:06:30,198
As long as you get in, it's fine.

1790
01:06:30,399 --> 01:06:32,209
He's really unathletic.

1791
01:06:32,269 --> 01:06:33,339
Okay, let's go.

1792
01:06:33,339 --> 01:06:34,778
Turn the rope. I'll try going in.

1793
01:06:34,778 --> 01:06:36,778
- You can't practice. - There's no practice.

1794
01:06:36,778 --> 01:06:37,948
- You can't practice. - You can't.

1795
01:06:37,948 --> 01:06:39,608
It's because he's tall. We want to see if he fits.

1796
01:06:39,608 --> 01:06:41,318
- We want to see if it's okay. - This is your second chance.

1797
01:06:41,318 --> 01:06:42,618
I can't even try?

1798
01:06:42,618 --> 01:06:43,818
Come closer.

1799
01:06:43,818 --> 01:06:45,118
If you're too tall,

1800
01:06:45,118 --> 01:06:46,889
you can duck down and jump.

1801
01:06:46,889 --> 01:06:49,419
- You don't have to jump like this. - We just wanted to check.

1802
01:06:49,518 --> 01:06:51,959
You can jump like this from the first place.

1803
01:06:52,259 --> 01:06:55,259
Ji Won has been on many variety shows.

1804
01:06:55,858 --> 01:06:58,768
- How humiliating. We have to win. - Yes. Let's go.

1805
01:06:58,929 --> 01:07:00,828
- We're going to succeed. - You can do it.

1806
01:07:00,828 --> 01:07:01,938
Hey.

1807
01:07:01,938 --> 01:07:04,099
Go in once the rope hits the floor.

1808
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:06,669
- Go in once it hits the floor. - You're too tall?

1809
01:07:06,669 --> 01:07:08,578
This is tall enough for Seo Jang Hoon.

1810
01:07:08,578 --> 01:07:10,139
- When do I go in? - Once it hits the floor.

1811
01:07:10,139 --> 01:07:11,749
- Go. - Do I go first?

1812
01:07:11,978 --> 01:07:13,908
- Go in. - Go now.

1813
01:07:13,908 --> 01:07:15,349
(Go in now.)

1814
01:07:15,978 --> 01:07:17,448
Go in. Just do it.

1815
01:07:17,478 --> 01:07:19,389
Run to it. Go.

1816
01:07:20,018 --> 01:07:21,318
- Go. - It hit the floor.

1817
01:07:21,318 --> 01:07:22,419
(He's about to go.)

1818
01:07:22,419 --> 01:07:23,459
Go in once it hits the floor.

1819
01:07:23,459 --> 01:07:24,528
- It hit the floor. - Go.

1820
01:07:25,389 --> 01:07:26,688
- He's late. - Good job. You got it.

1821
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:28,728
- Go in once it hits the floor. - Go.

1822
01:07:28,898 --> 01:07:30,599
- He's late. - Good job. You got it.

1823
01:07:31,129 --> 01:07:33,828
- Good job. - Where are you going?

1824
01:07:33,828 --> 01:07:36,438
- Move up. - Where are you going?

1825
01:07:36,438 --> 01:07:38,509
(He's moving up by a tiny bit.)

1826
01:07:39,169 --> 01:07:41,478
Hurry up.

1827
01:07:41,478 --> 01:07:42,578
- Hurry up. - Go.

1828
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:44,379
Good job.

1829
01:07:44,749 --> 01:07:46,379
(She's in right away.)

1830
01:07:46,379 --> 01:07:47,448
This is good.

1831
01:07:47,448 --> 01:07:48,849
We're not counting down yet.

1832
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,379
Seok Jin is next.

1833
01:07:50,478 --> 01:07:52,719
- We can count on him. - It's Seok Jin's turn.

1834
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:54,618
- Kwang Soo is tired already. - Go in.

1835
01:07:55,289 --> 01:07:56,419
Go.

1836
01:07:56,419 --> 01:07:57,728
- You have to go. - You go.

1837
01:07:58,028 --> 01:08:00,028
- It hit the floor. You go first. - You have to go.

1838
01:08:00,688 --> 01:08:04,929
(Seok Jin can't jump too many times, so he makes Elijah go.)

1839
01:08:05,868 --> 01:08:08,099
- Elijah. - Go.

1840
01:08:09,099 --> 01:08:13,339
(What? She gets caught in the rope.)

1841
01:08:15,209 --> 01:08:19,379
(She stumbles and falls.)

1842
01:08:19,379 --> 01:08:21,349
(It slaps him.)

1843
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,749
(It's 2017's last slapstick comedy.)

1844
01:08:26,749 --> 01:08:28,158
- Elijah. - What now?

1845
01:08:28,559 --> 01:08:30,089
What now? It doesn't look pretty.

1846
01:08:30,789 --> 01:08:32,828
- Everybody is laughing. - None of you...

1847
01:08:33,259 --> 01:08:34,559
None of you are athletic.

1848
01:08:34,559 --> 01:08:36,299
- I'm sorry. - It didn't look pretty.

1849
01:08:36,358 --> 01:08:37,568
- It didn't look nice. - Excuse me.

1850
01:08:37,828 --> 01:08:39,799
- I... - It didn't look pretty.

1851
01:08:39,799 --> 01:08:41,068
I'm sorry.

1852
01:08:41,068 --> 01:08:42,568
- My bad. - This is too funny, Elijah.

1853
01:08:42,568 --> 01:08:44,539
- That was too funny. - The three of them...

1854
01:08:44,539 --> 01:08:46,568
- What do I do? - That was funny though.

1855
01:08:46,669 --> 01:08:47,778
That didn't look pretty.

1856
01:08:47,778 --> 01:08:49,778
You were as funny as you can be here.

1857
01:08:49,879 --> 01:08:51,448
He got slapped, she got caught on the rope and fell.

1858
01:08:51,648 --> 01:08:53,679
- She got caught on the rope. - Is that what you wanted?

1859
01:08:53,948 --> 01:08:56,179
You got slapped by the rope.

1860
01:08:56,879 --> 01:08:58,889
(That should ward off all the misfortune in 2018.)

1861
01:08:58,889 --> 01:09:00,118
That was so funny.

1862
01:09:00,118 --> 01:09:01,188
So...

1863
01:09:01,188 --> 01:09:02,919
- It hit me. - Team Gray fails.

1864
01:09:02,919 --> 01:09:04,089
They get 10 Ice Stickers.

1865
01:09:04,089 --> 01:09:06,459
(Team Gray gets 10 Ice Stickers.)

1866
01:09:07,089 --> 01:09:09,198
- Team Black is next. - Okay.

1867
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:10,759
- Team Black. - They're "all inconsistent".

1868
01:09:10,759 --> 01:09:12,068
- "All inconsistent". - That's right.

1869
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,198
It's the "all inconsistent" mission.

1870
01:09:15,539 --> 01:09:16,669
What's "inconsistent choice"?

1871
01:09:18,209 --> 01:09:20,339
Inconsistent Choice.

1872
01:09:20,339 --> 01:09:22,179
If you're inconsistent with each other, you win.

1873
01:09:22,179 --> 01:09:23,509
(If they're all inconsistent, they win.)

1874
01:09:23,509 --> 01:09:25,509
How many stickers would you like to bet?

1875
01:09:26,349 --> 01:09:28,179
- If we win, - 10 is good.

1876
01:09:28,179 --> 01:09:29,978
We should give it to one person.

1877
01:09:30,318 --> 01:09:33,448
- Okay. - If we lose, distribute it.

1878
01:09:33,448 --> 01:09:35,389
- Okay. 10 it is. - Let's do that.

1879
01:09:35,658 --> 01:09:37,188
- 10 stickers. - Here's the question.

1880
01:09:37,188 --> 01:09:39,188
(They have to listen to the question and write different answers.)

1881
01:09:39,188 --> 01:09:40,828
None of you should have the same answer.

1882
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:47,499
Including Sechs Kies and the two female guests,

1883
01:09:47,499 --> 01:09:49,898
we have seven guests today. Write one of their names.

1884
01:09:49,898 --> 01:09:55,478
(From Sechs Kies and 2 female guests, write 1 name down.)

1885
01:09:55,478 --> 01:09:56,809
- 1 person? - Write 1 name down.

1886
01:09:57,438 --> 01:09:58,978
(This is difficult.)

1887
01:09:58,978 --> 01:10:00,309
They have to remember the guests' names.

1888
01:10:00,309 --> 01:10:01,818
There will be repeats.

1889
01:10:02,049 --> 01:10:03,749
- You can't talk. - Okay.

1890
01:10:03,749 --> 01:10:05,749
- You can't. - This is difficult.

1891
01:10:06,089 --> 01:10:07,589
- This is difficult. - Write one name.

1892
01:10:07,759 --> 01:10:10,719
- This is so hard. - It is.

1893
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:11,988
There will be same answers.

1894
01:10:12,089 --> 01:10:14,158
- This is hard. - If you hesitate, you'll fail.

1895
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:15,299
You have to write down whatever.

1896
01:10:15,528 --> 01:10:18,999
(It's hard not to think about it.)

1897
01:10:20,099 --> 01:10:23,068
(Will Team Black all write different answers?)

1898
01:10:23,268 --> 01:10:24,408
Let's start with So Min.

1899
01:10:24,568 --> 01:10:26,309
- So Min. In 1, 2, 3. - So Min first.

1900
01:10:26,908 --> 01:10:29,309
(They have to be inconsistent with each other.)

1901
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:32,349
(She has to start it off well.)

1902
01:10:33,009 --> 01:10:34,249
Jang Su Won.

1903
01:10:34,249 --> 01:10:38,118
(She wrote Su Won's name.)

1904
01:10:38,589 --> 01:10:39,749
- Oh, my goodness. - Jang Su Won.

1905
01:10:40,889 --> 01:10:42,118
(What?)

1906
01:10:42,118 --> 01:10:43,459
Why did you write his name?

1907
01:10:44,188 --> 01:10:45,589
Why did you do that?

1908
01:10:45,688 --> 01:10:47,728
- Come on. - She shouldn't have done that.

1909
01:10:47,728 --> 01:10:48,999
Are you stupid?

1910
01:10:48,999 --> 01:10:50,299
Jong Kook.

1911
01:10:50,398 --> 01:10:51,568
- All right. - What's going on?

1912
01:10:51,568 --> 01:10:53,568
- I'm here. - He's in our team.

1913
01:10:53,568 --> 01:10:55,268
- I should write my name down. - Goodness.

1914
01:10:55,738 --> 01:10:57,908
(They match, so they failed.)

1915
01:10:57,908 --> 01:10:59,539
- Okay, they wrote the same. - Yes.

1916
01:11:00,009 --> 01:11:01,938
- They matched. - Yes.

1917
01:11:02,309 --> 01:11:03,608
- They matched. - What a fool

1918
01:11:03,608 --> 01:11:04,879
I knew she was going to do that.

1919
01:11:04,879 --> 01:11:06,049
There are other guests,

1920
01:11:06,049 --> 01:11:07,719
so I thought they would choose from here.

1921
01:11:08,349 --> 01:11:11,518
Su Won and So Min wrote the same answer, so you fail.

1922
01:11:11,589 --> 01:11:13,118
What a fool.

1923
01:11:13,219 --> 01:11:16,188
So Min is a fool.

1924
01:11:16,358 --> 01:11:17,889
If she wrote somebody else's name...

1925
01:11:17,889 --> 01:11:19,429
(They almost got it.)

1926
01:11:19,629 --> 01:11:22,259
- If she wrote somebody else... - Really?

1927
01:11:22,259 --> 01:11:25,368
I thought you would choose from here, not from the same team.

1928
01:11:25,728 --> 01:11:28,068
- Why did she write Su Won? - No, it was good.

1929
01:11:28,438 --> 01:11:30,568
I think So Min will drink tonight.

1930
01:11:30,669 --> 01:11:33,408
I'm sorry, but can I have some soju?

1931
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:35,278
- Why did she do that? - The red one.

1932
01:11:35,278 --> 01:11:36,379
It's hard to believe.

1933
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:37,608
(Team Black earns 10 Ice Stickers.)

1934
01:11:37,778 --> 01:11:39,778
We'll bet nine stickers. We might still win.

1935
01:11:40,009 --> 01:11:41,719
Let's keep one to be safe.

1936
01:11:42,549 --> 01:11:44,018
Please open it.

1937
01:11:45,589 --> 01:11:47,858
- It's "all consistent", right? - It's one or the other.

1938
01:11:47,858 --> 01:11:48,988
You can't smell it.

1939
01:11:48,988 --> 01:11:50,858
- This is the steamed bun mission. - This is hard.

1940
01:11:50,858 --> 01:11:53,929
One of the buns has red bean in it, and the other one doesn't.

1941
01:11:53,929 --> 01:11:56,299
(They must choose one and match in order to win.)

1942
01:11:56,299 --> 01:11:57,999
- This is so hard. - How do you pick?

1943
01:11:57,999 --> 01:11:59,299
(It's hard to match, but it's also up to luck.)

1944
01:11:59,299 --> 01:12:00,599
- This is hard too. - Choose...

1945
01:12:00,669 --> 01:12:03,169
and once I count down, break the bun in half and show it.

1946
01:12:03,169 --> 01:12:05,938
- This is so hard. - It's red bean or no red bean.

1947
01:12:05,938 --> 01:12:07,039
You can't smell it.

1948
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:08,978
You won't know by looking either. You just have to choose.

1949
01:12:08,978 --> 01:12:10,009
We'll know if we look.

1950
01:12:10,009 --> 01:12:11,978
- I'm not sure. - They'll know if they look.

1951
01:12:12,478 --> 01:12:15,318
- They all have to choose the same. - Right. They have to match.

1952
01:12:15,318 --> 01:12:17,219
- You can't discuss. - It's hard to match.

1953
01:12:17,219 --> 01:12:19,549
They all have to choose the red bean or no red bean.

1954
01:12:19,889 --> 01:12:22,289
What do we do then? The red bean or no red bean?

1955
01:12:22,289 --> 01:12:24,018
- All right. - You can't discuss.

1956
01:12:24,018 --> 01:12:25,389
You can't discuss.

1957
01:12:25,389 --> 01:12:27,898
- Remember what I said earlier. - Just go.

1958
01:12:27,898 --> 01:12:28,999
One,

1959
01:12:29,328 --> 01:12:30,898
- two, - Hold on.

1960
01:12:31,068 --> 01:12:32,599
- three. - Oh, gosh.

1961
01:12:32,599 --> 01:12:33,929
(Team White chooses their buns.)

1962
01:12:33,929 --> 01:12:35,999
Choose it and break it in half.

1963
01:12:35,999 --> 01:12:37,908
(Did they all choose the same one?)

1964
01:12:38,068 --> 01:12:39,209
You can open it one by one.

1965
01:12:39,408 --> 01:12:40,839
- I... - I think they got it.

1966
01:12:41,179 --> 01:12:42,309
Hold on.

1967
01:12:42,309 --> 01:12:43,309
What?

1968
01:12:44,139 --> 01:12:46,349
- Oh, dear. - It's all red bean.

1969
01:12:47,078 --> 01:12:48,618
Did they match?

1970
01:12:49,078 --> 01:12:50,179
Did we match?

1971
01:12:50,448 --> 01:12:53,049
(Jae Seok got red bean as well.)

1972
01:12:53,049 --> 01:12:54,148
Did we match?

1973
01:12:54,148 --> 01:12:58,759
(If Jae Jin picked red bean, Team White wins.)

1974
01:12:59,488 --> 01:13:01,259
(Goodness)

1975
01:13:01,259 --> 01:13:02,459
(There is...)

1976
01:13:02,459 --> 01:13:04,129
(no red bean.)

1977
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:05,129
What happened?

1978
01:13:06,768 --> 01:13:08,198
Did we get it? What?

1979
01:13:08,368 --> 01:13:10,339
- Did we match? - What?

1980
01:13:11,238 --> 01:13:12,568
Did we?

1981
01:13:12,568 --> 01:13:16,408
(What?)

1982
01:13:16,879 --> 01:13:18,679
He didn't match.

1983
01:13:18,709 --> 01:13:20,948
Why?

1984
01:13:20,948 --> 01:13:22,578
This is what I'm talking about.

1985
01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:24,948
He didn't match.

1986
01:13:24,948 --> 01:13:27,488
Jae Jin helped us.

1987
01:13:29,059 --> 01:13:31,328
Jae Jin, why did you choose this?

1988
01:13:32,028 --> 01:13:33,328
- Only one person didn't match. - That was close.

1989
01:13:33,328 --> 01:13:34,898
They almost won.

1990
01:13:35,059 --> 01:13:36,629
Did you say you'd know if you looked at it?

1991
01:13:37,328 --> 01:13:38,568
What do you know?

1992
01:13:38,728 --> 01:13:40,328
This is obviously the red bean one.

1993
01:13:40,898 --> 01:13:43,368
Since Jae Jin picked a different one...

1994
01:13:43,568 --> 01:13:44,669
We almost had it.

1995
01:13:44,669 --> 01:13:45,809
That was unbelievable.

1996
01:13:45,809 --> 01:13:48,839
I'm not even shocked. He always does something different.

1997
01:13:48,839 --> 01:13:50,108
(He's not shocked anymore.)

1998
01:13:50,108 --> 01:13:52,408
- I'm not shocked anymore. - I see.

1999
01:13:52,408 --> 01:13:53,478
(Team White gets 9 Ice Stickers.)

2000
01:13:54,148 --> 01:13:55,778
We have the results now.

2001
01:13:55,778 --> 01:13:58,488
- You all failed your missions, - Right.

2002
01:13:59,219 --> 01:14:01,789
So you'll get 10, 10, and 9 Ice Stickers.

2003
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:04,259
So naturally, today's winner is...

2004
01:14:04,688 --> 01:14:06,528
- It's Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo with seven Fire Sticker.

2005
01:14:07,089 --> 01:14:08,358
This is unbelievable.

2006
01:14:08,358 --> 01:14:11,028
(Kwang Soo wins with 7 Fire Stickers.)

2007
01:14:12,028 --> 01:14:13,068
(He's a fiery man.)

2008
01:14:13,068 --> 01:14:14,499
Can we give it to a guest?

2009
01:14:16,099 --> 01:14:17,238
(They can't be happy for him, because he betrayed them.)

2010
01:14:17,238 --> 01:14:19,238
Again? He won again?

2011
01:14:19,908 --> 01:14:22,478
But he can also get a penalty.

2012
01:14:22,478 --> 01:14:23,809
- Right. - If he gets nine stickers.

2013
01:14:23,809 --> 01:14:25,349
- We have 10. - He can lose.

2014
01:14:25,349 --> 01:14:27,278
(Anybody can lose if they get all the Ice Stickers.)

2015
01:14:27,278 --> 01:14:31,688
(Even if you have many Ice Stickers, you can turn this around.)

2016
01:14:33,049 --> 01:14:35,318
Team Gray can decide...

2017
01:14:35,318 --> 01:14:37,059
how to distribute the nine stickers.

2018
01:14:37,658 --> 01:14:39,728
- Let's not put it in one box. - Let's not.

2019
01:14:40,228 --> 01:14:41,328
- Maybe... - We don't want to lose.

2020
01:14:41,328 --> 01:14:43,158
Split it by two.

2021
01:14:43,198 --> 01:14:44,398
You can have three.

2022
01:14:44,398 --> 01:14:46,898
It's dangerous for Jae Duck. He's still in our team.

2023
01:14:47,129 --> 01:14:49,139
- We should protect him. - How can we protect him?

2024
01:14:49,339 --> 01:14:50,438
- We have to put it in one box. - That's right.

2025
01:14:50,698 --> 01:14:51,969
Let's put eight in one box then.

2026
01:14:51,969 --> 01:14:54,509
I'm sorry, but why should I help Jae Duck?

2027
01:14:55,978 --> 01:14:57,709
(I have to look after myself.)

2028
01:14:57,709 --> 01:14:59,249
- I might get the penalty. - I'm thinking the same.

2029
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:01,349
You're in first place.

2030
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:04,488
Let's show our teamwork in the end.

2031
01:15:04,488 --> 01:15:05,988
- Okay, let's do this. - Let's just split it up.

2032
01:15:06,249 --> 01:15:08,188
- Su Won and Se Chan... - 2 and 8?

2033
01:15:08,188 --> 01:15:10,259
Have 6 too. They're only 1 less than me.

2034
01:15:10,488 --> 01:15:12,259
- That's true. - Yes, we can do that.

2035
01:15:12,389 --> 01:15:14,398
- So we... - Should we do 2 and 8?

2036
01:15:14,398 --> 01:15:15,799
- That sounds good. - Let's do that.

2037
01:15:15,999 --> 01:15:17,528
- We'll do 2 and 8. - 2 and 8?

2038
01:15:17,528 --> 01:15:19,799
You said 2 and 8.

2039
01:15:20,268 --> 01:15:23,938
- Team Black can place them. - We can?

2040
01:15:24,908 --> 01:15:26,339
As long as I don't pick the box with eight stickers.

2041
01:15:26,339 --> 01:15:28,009
That's true. Two is fine.

2042
01:15:28,009 --> 01:15:29,339
(Jae Duck has 7 Ice Stickers, so he has to go for no stickers.)

2043
01:15:29,339 --> 01:15:31,448
We're trying to be loyal to Jae Duck, so we're doing eight.

2044
01:15:31,448 --> 01:15:32,608
2 and 8?

2045
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:35,879
What if Kwang Soo takes all of them?

2046
01:15:36,078 --> 01:15:38,188
It'll be great if he gets the penalty and donates too.

2047
01:15:39,688 --> 01:15:41,219
- All right. Shall we start? - All right.

2048
01:15:41,389 --> 01:15:42,419
Let's go.

2049
01:15:42,618 --> 01:15:45,228
Please choose a number each.

2050
01:15:45,488 --> 01:15:47,158
- Soyou, you're up. - Me?

2051
01:15:47,389 --> 01:15:49,559
- I choose number 1. - Number 1. Please put her name.

2052
01:15:49,559 --> 01:15:50,728
Okay, this is Soyou.

2053
01:15:50,728 --> 01:15:53,129
Next is Kwang Soo.

2054
01:15:53,129 --> 01:15:54,698
(Next up is Kwang Soo, who's the winner.)

2055
01:15:56,539 --> 01:15:58,169
- Number 2. - Number 2. All right.

2056
01:15:58,608 --> 01:16:00,509
- Okay. - Elijah.

2057
01:16:00,509 --> 01:16:01,709
(If you choose 8 Ice Stickers, you're likely to lose.)

2058
01:16:01,709 --> 01:16:03,108
- Number 4. - Number 4.

2059
01:16:03,778 --> 01:16:04,978
I choose three then.

2060
01:16:05,078 --> 01:16:06,148
I choose three.

2061
01:16:06,148 --> 01:16:07,309
Seok Jin is number three.

2062
01:16:08,219 --> 01:16:09,749
And Jae Duck?

2063
01:16:09,978 --> 01:16:11,318
It's 5 or 6.

2064
01:16:12,488 --> 01:16:13,818
- 5? - 6.

2065
01:16:13,818 --> 01:16:14,858
Six? Sounds good.

2066
01:16:14,858 --> 01:16:16,789
We'll give you a chance to switch.

2067
01:16:16,789 --> 01:16:18,188
(These are the current placements.)

2068
01:16:18,858 --> 01:16:20,828
(We'll give you a chance to switch.)

2069
01:16:20,828 --> 01:16:22,629
- No, I don't want to switch. - Which one's left?

2070
01:16:23,429 --> 01:16:25,099
- 5 is left. - 5 is left.

2071
01:16:25,599 --> 01:16:27,429
I want to switch.

2072
01:16:27,639 --> 01:16:28,868
To which one?

2073
01:16:29,068 --> 01:16:30,139
I'll go to five.

2074
01:16:30,139 --> 01:16:31,139
(Soyou switches from number 1 to 5.)

2075
01:16:31,139 --> 01:16:33,539
- Number 5? - Soyou moves from 1 to 5.

2076
01:16:34,209 --> 01:16:35,478
Can I go to number one?

2077
01:16:36,009 --> 01:16:37,879
- Okay. - You can if you want.

2078
01:16:38,209 --> 01:16:39,509
Kwang Soo goes to number one. That's good.

2079
01:16:40,009 --> 01:16:41,478
Number two is free.

2080
01:16:41,478 --> 01:16:43,448
Who wants number two?

2081
01:16:43,448 --> 01:16:44,488
(They hesitate.)

2082
01:16:44,488 --> 01:16:45,549
- Should I do number 2? - Number 2 is free.

2083
01:16:46,688 --> 01:16:48,658
- I'll stay in five. - All right.

2084
01:16:48,658 --> 01:16:51,459
(Team Gray finishes and leaves number 2 blank.)

2085
01:16:51,759 --> 01:16:53,158
All right. Let's go.

2086
01:16:53,228 --> 01:16:55,528
In 1, 2...

2087
01:16:55,828 --> 01:16:57,228
(If they avoid 8 stickers, everyone but Jae Duck is safe.)

2088
01:16:57,228 --> 01:16:58,328
Two...

2089
01:16:58,328 --> 01:16:59,868
(If they avoid 8 stickers, everyone but Jae Duck is safe.)

2090
01:17:00,169 --> 01:17:01,169
Three.

2091
01:17:01,169 --> 01:17:03,039
(Jae Duck has to avoid the Ice Stickers.)

2092
01:17:03,768 --> 01:17:07,738
(Kwang Soo gets 8 stickers.)

2093
01:17:08,108 --> 01:17:09,438
This is unbelievable.

2094
01:17:10,139 --> 01:17:11,679
- 2, 3. - It doesn't matter.

2095
01:17:12,679 --> 01:17:15,018
(What?)

2096
01:17:15,978 --> 01:17:19,089
(Everybody is shocked by how unlucky Kwang Soo is.)

2097
01:17:19,089 --> 01:17:20,349
This is unbelievable.

2098
01:17:20,349 --> 01:17:22,089
See? That's what I said.

2099
01:17:22,089 --> 01:17:23,759
- This is unbelievable. - Kwang Soo, that's what I said.

2100
01:17:24,358 --> 01:17:25,728
This is fate, Kwang Soo.

2101
01:17:25,728 --> 01:17:27,828
The spirit of Pyeongchang.

2102
01:17:28,129 --> 01:17:29,799
- Kwang Soo. - This is fate.

2103
01:17:29,799 --> 01:17:32,469
(Their fates changed after Soyou switched.)

2104
01:17:32,469 --> 01:17:33,768
He did it himself.

2105
01:17:34,028 --> 01:17:35,539
Kwang Soo chose number five...

2106
01:17:35,539 --> 01:17:37,198
- He switched. - He did.

2107
01:17:37,299 --> 01:17:40,469
So Kwang Soo has the most Ice Stickers with eight.

2108
01:17:40,608 --> 01:17:43,938
I can't believe he moved to number one. It's incredible.

2109
01:17:44,078 --> 01:17:46,249
It's so interesting. He has a feeling.

2110
01:17:46,249 --> 01:17:47,948
The spirits are with you.

2111
01:17:47,948 --> 01:17:50,518
Next team will start betting now.

2112
01:17:50,518 --> 01:17:51,889
(Team Black's Ice Sticker count)

2113
01:17:51,889 --> 01:17:54,658
If Su Won doesn't get one, he's in last place.

2114
01:17:54,759 --> 01:17:55,919
Please choose your numbers.

2115
01:17:55,919 --> 01:17:57,188
- I choose 2. - 2.

2116
01:17:57,188 --> 01:17:58,289
- I choose 3. - 3.

2117
01:17:58,289 --> 01:17:59,358
So Min said four?

2118
01:17:59,358 --> 01:18:01,658
If Su Won gets more than 0 or 1, he's done.

2119
01:18:01,799 --> 01:18:03,898
- In 1, 2, 3. - I'll survive.

2120
01:18:03,898 --> 01:18:05,828
(Su Won survives with 1 Ice Sticker.)

2121
01:18:05,828 --> 01:18:07,799
- You survived. - This is incredible.

2122
01:18:07,799 --> 01:18:09,599
Kwang Soo is still in last place with eight stickers.

2123
01:18:10,039 --> 01:18:13,809
(Team White's Ice Sticker count)

2124
01:18:14,068 --> 01:18:15,139
We'll do...

2125
01:18:15,478 --> 01:18:18,108
1, 1, 1, 1, and 5.

2126
01:18:18,578 --> 01:18:19,948
- 4 1's and a single 5? - Yes.

2127
01:18:19,978 --> 01:18:22,618
The stickers will be placed by Team Gray.

2128
01:18:22,618 --> 01:18:24,179
- 4 1's and a single 5. - How many stickers do they have?

2129
01:18:24,789 --> 01:18:26,318
Se Chan has six,

2130
01:18:26,948 --> 01:18:28,518
and Jae Jin also has six.

2131
01:18:28,818 --> 01:18:30,289
Ji Won has four.

2132
01:18:30,589 --> 01:18:33,259
Sung Hoon and I have two each.

2133
01:18:33,259 --> 01:18:35,358
I got four against my will.

2134
01:18:35,358 --> 01:18:38,929
If we get more than five,

2135
01:18:39,629 --> 01:18:40,999
we'll have more than Kwang Soo.

2136
01:18:41,139 --> 01:18:43,139
For example, Se Chan, Jae Jin,

2137
01:18:43,438 --> 01:18:46,639
and Ji Won will have more, so Kwang Soo won't be last.

2138
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:48,778
That's right. Se Chan, Ji Won, and Jae Jin.

2139
01:18:48,778 --> 01:18:49,978
- Let's go. - Okay.

2140
01:18:49,978 --> 01:18:51,049
Let's do this.

2141
01:18:51,778 --> 01:18:54,249
We all have the same thing in mind. Let's try our best.

2142
01:18:54,749 --> 01:18:56,618
We are all thinking the same, so let's try our best.

2143
01:18:57,018 --> 01:18:58,018
We can do this.

2144
01:18:58,018 --> 01:19:00,249
Let's get the energy of Pyeongchang.

2145
01:19:00,249 --> 01:19:01,518
Okay, let's go.

2146
01:19:01,789 --> 01:19:05,228
(Who will receive the final penalty of 2017?)

2147
01:19:05,228 --> 01:19:07,929
For your information, Kwang Soo placed them.

2148
01:19:07,929 --> 01:19:09,828
- We followed his opinion. - And...

2149
01:19:10,099 --> 01:19:11,328
you get no chance to switch.

2150
01:19:12,068 --> 01:19:13,169
Once you say it, it's done.

2151
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:16,499
- Se Chan, - Jae Jin?

2152
01:19:16,599 --> 01:19:18,139
And Jae Jin should go first.

2153
01:19:18,139 --> 01:19:19,438
- Go, Jae Jin. - Jae Jin.

2154
01:19:19,438 --> 01:19:20,768
I pick one.

2155
01:19:20,978 --> 01:19:21,978
Number one.

2156
01:19:22,639 --> 01:19:24,749
I pick two.

2157
01:19:25,448 --> 01:19:26,778
- Sorry? - Who's two?

2158
01:19:26,908 --> 01:19:28,318
- We're important in this. - I pick two.

2159
01:19:28,318 --> 01:19:29,518
- Number two? - Yes.

2160
01:19:30,679 --> 01:19:32,448
- Ji Won. - He likes one.

2161
01:19:32,448 --> 01:19:34,289
- Go in a row. - Do that.

2162
01:19:34,389 --> 01:19:35,759
- 3. - 3?

2163
01:19:36,358 --> 01:19:37,518
They're going in a row.

2164
01:19:37,629 --> 01:19:39,089
I pick number four.

2165
01:19:39,089 --> 01:19:41,358
(Jae Seok picks number 4. He has no chance of losing.)

2166
01:19:43,228 --> 01:19:44,469
- Sung Hoon? - Wait.

2167
01:19:44,599 --> 01:19:46,268
- Wait. They're smiling. - Number five.

2168
01:19:46,568 --> 01:19:48,499
(His lips twitch.)

2169
01:19:48,599 --> 01:19:50,099
I think we dodged the worst.

2170
01:19:50,099 --> 01:19:52,169
I think we did. Look at his face.

2171
01:19:52,368 --> 01:19:53,768
We dodged it.

2172
01:19:54,809 --> 01:19:57,509
(I don't think we're last.)

2173
01:19:58,209 --> 01:20:00,509
(What is Kwang Soo going to do?)

2174
01:20:01,349 --> 01:20:03,549
- It looks like... - Let's open it.

2175
01:20:03,719 --> 01:20:05,389
- We dodged it. - We did.

2176
01:20:05,618 --> 01:20:06,688
Keep a straight face.

2177
01:20:06,688 --> 01:20:07,818
- It's okay. - Can they switch?

2178
01:20:08,089 --> 01:20:10,929
- They can. - Once.

2179
01:20:11,589 --> 01:20:13,429
- We don't want to switch. - I thought we can't.

2180
01:20:13,759 --> 01:20:15,599
- You said we can't switch. - We don't want to switch.

2181
01:20:15,858 --> 01:20:18,728
After Sung Hoon and I chose our numbers,

2182
01:20:18,728 --> 01:20:21,099
he said we can't switch and now...

2183
01:20:21,969 --> 01:20:22,999
What would you like to do?

2184
01:20:23,738 --> 01:20:25,438
- We won't switch. - Look at his face.

2185
01:20:25,438 --> 01:20:27,608
You don't want to switch? We'll give you one last chance.

2186
01:20:27,778 --> 01:20:28,778
I pick six.

2187
01:20:28,778 --> 01:20:30,438
(Punching)

2188
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:31,879
(When I'm trying to do you a favor, take it.)

2189
01:20:31,879 --> 01:20:34,009
Kwang Soo hit him really hard.

2190
01:20:34,549 --> 01:20:35,849
It's serious here.

2191
01:20:35,849 --> 01:20:37,249
If Ji Won, Jae Jin,

2192
01:20:37,318 --> 01:20:39,549
or Se Chan...

2193
01:20:39,549 --> 01:20:41,589
gets five stickers, the results change.

2194
01:20:41,589 --> 01:20:42,589
We are not switching?

2195
01:20:42,589 --> 01:20:43,759
I'll give you three seconds.

2196
01:20:44,459 --> 01:20:45,728
- If you don't switch... - I think it's best...

2197
01:20:45,728 --> 01:20:47,328
for you not to speak.

2198
01:20:47,999 --> 01:20:50,429
- I choose number 6. - You have 3 seconds.

2199
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:52,099
- Number 6? okay. - Jae Jin chooses 6.

2200
01:20:52,099 --> 01:20:53,129
(Jae Jin changes to 6 in the last second.)

2201
01:20:53,129 --> 01:20:54,999
(Whispering)

2202
01:20:55,499 --> 01:20:57,669
(Kwang Soo and Seok Jin smile.)

2203
01:20:57,669 --> 01:21:01,578
(Sechs Kies members start laughing as well.)

2204
01:21:01,578 --> 01:21:04,478
(I think somebody lost.)

2205
01:21:04,608 --> 01:21:06,549
- 1... - 1...

2206
01:21:06,549 --> 01:21:08,018
(Kwang Soo is currently in last place.)

2207
01:21:08,018 --> 01:21:09,219
- 2... - 2...

2208
01:21:09,219 --> 01:21:12,049
(Jae Jin, Se Chan, or Ji Won can be last.)

2209
01:21:12,049 --> 01:21:13,118
- 3. - 3.

2210
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:16,118
(If one of them gets 5 Ice Stickers, Kwang Soo won't lose.)

2211
01:21:16,118 --> 01:21:17,929
(What is the final result?)

2212
01:21:17,929 --> 01:21:19,528
Gosh, you passed.

2213
01:21:19,528 --> 01:21:23,858
(Kwang Soo is in last place.)

2214
01:21:24,828 --> 01:21:26,768
- It was Sung Hoon. - Goodness.

2215
01:21:26,768 --> 01:21:28,999
- Sung Hoon got it. - Look at that, Se Chan.

2216
01:21:29,669 --> 01:21:32,809
(Kwang Soo is in last place with 8 stickers.)

2217
01:21:32,809 --> 01:21:34,039
Hold on.

2218
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:36,438
(Turn off the camera.)

2219
01:21:37,749 --> 01:21:39,408
So today's...

2220
01:21:39,408 --> 01:21:40,778
You are not getting the penalty.

2221
01:21:40,978 --> 01:21:42,448
- Is this over? - You have the spotlight.

2222
01:21:42,448 --> 01:21:43,818
Is this over?

2223
01:21:43,818 --> 01:21:45,419
- Kwang Soo is the loser... - Is this over?

2224
01:21:46,249 --> 01:21:48,858
Kwang Soo is the loser with eight Ice Stickers.

2225
01:21:48,889 --> 01:21:51,328
- But who is the winner? - Kwang Soo is also the winner...

2226
01:21:51,328 --> 01:21:52,629
with seven Fire Stickers.

2227
01:21:52,629 --> 01:21:54,129
(Kwang Soo is both the loser and winner.)

2228
01:21:54,129 --> 01:21:55,158
I knew he would win.

2229
01:21:55,158 --> 01:21:56,158
Congratulations.

2230
01:21:56,599 --> 01:21:57,969
You are incredible.

2231
01:21:57,969 --> 01:22:00,028
- You are incredible, Kwang Soo. - Respect, respect.

2232
01:22:00,429 --> 01:22:03,099
Big respect, big respect, Superman, Superman, Superman.

2233
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:05,469
- Also... - Avatar, Avatar, Avatar.

2234
01:22:05,469 --> 01:22:06,938
I choose him to take the penalty with me.

2235
01:22:06,938 --> 01:22:08,238
(I choose him to take the penalty with me.)

2236
01:22:08,238 --> 01:22:09,839
- What are you doing? - What?

2237
01:22:10,139 --> 01:22:11,648
- What are you doing? - I get to choose one person, right?

2238
01:22:11,648 --> 01:22:13,049
Think it over.

2239
01:22:13,309 --> 01:22:14,318
Kwang Soo.

2240
01:22:14,318 --> 01:22:17,318
Kwang Soo, please choose a member...

2241
01:22:17,719 --> 01:22:19,719
who will take the penalty with you.

2242
01:22:19,719 --> 01:22:20,959
I can't believe it happened this way.

2243
01:22:20,959 --> 01:22:22,188
(Who is he planning to choose as his partner?)

2244
01:22:23,559 --> 01:22:25,688
Please say a few words to me.

2245
01:22:26,028 --> 01:22:27,028
Keep it simple.

2246
01:22:27,629 --> 01:22:29,759
- All of us? - Keep it simple and short.

2247
01:22:30,328 --> 01:22:32,528
I don't want a long speech. Ji Won, say a few words.

2248
01:22:32,728 --> 01:22:33,728
Congratulations on your victory.

2249
01:22:34,839 --> 01:22:36,299
Okay.

2250
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:38,039
I have nothing to say.

2251
01:22:38,908 --> 01:22:40,539
You are the first one in the history...

2252
01:22:40,908 --> 01:22:43,408
of Running Man to win and lose at the same time.

2253
01:22:44,379 --> 01:22:46,309
- Respect. - This is...

2254
01:22:46,309 --> 01:22:47,349
Big respect.

2255
01:22:47,778 --> 01:22:49,549
- Okay. - He was being sarcastic.

2256
01:22:49,948 --> 01:22:51,948
- He was being sarcastic. - He was totally being sarcastic.

2257
01:22:51,948 --> 01:22:52,948
All right.

2258
01:22:53,188 --> 01:22:54,419
Okay.

2259
01:22:55,459 --> 01:22:56,459
I am sticking my tongue out.

2260
01:22:56,459 --> 01:22:58,728
(I am sticking my tongue out.)

2261
01:22:58,889 --> 01:23:00,528
What was that?

2262
01:23:00,528 --> 01:23:02,629
He said, "I am sticking my tongue out."

2263
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:04,799
I am sticking my tongue out.

2264
01:23:04,799 --> 01:23:08,169
(What is his intention?)

2265
01:23:08,339 --> 01:23:09,799
Jae Seok, what was that?

2266
01:23:09,799 --> 01:23:11,339
- My goodness. - I mean...

2267
01:23:11,339 --> 01:23:13,108
Why did he do that?

2268
01:23:13,108 --> 01:23:14,908
- Why did he do that? - Jae Jin is like that.

2269
01:23:14,908 --> 01:23:16,209
- What? - Jae Jin is like that.

2270
01:23:16,738 --> 01:23:17,948
Why did he do that?

2271
01:23:17,948 --> 01:23:19,509
- Jae Jin is like that. - I don't understand.

2272
01:23:19,509 --> 01:23:20,549
Jae Jin is like that.

2273
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:22,578
I am already in the worst mood.

2274
01:23:22,578 --> 01:23:24,078
Why did he do that?

2275
01:23:25,549 --> 01:23:26,889
I will choose.

2276
01:23:26,889 --> 01:23:28,289
- Okay. - You know,

2277
01:23:28,818 --> 01:23:31,089
Sechs Kies should experience it.

2278
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:32,728
"I am sticking my tongue out" was too strong.

2279
01:23:32,728 --> 01:23:35,328
The guests get too much special treatment.

2280
01:23:36,129 --> 01:23:39,629
(Who is the one to stand next to Kwang Soo?)

2281
01:23:40,799 --> 01:23:41,839
- Let's see it. - Okay.

2282
01:23:41,839 --> 01:23:43,169
(It's time to check the result.)

2283
01:23:43,169 --> 01:23:46,738
Would you throw out those you didn't pick?

2284
01:23:46,738 --> 01:23:48,839
- I will go in order. - Please do that.

2285
01:23:48,839 --> 01:23:50,339
Leave three pieces behind.

2286
01:23:51,648 --> 01:23:53,179
It's Sung Hoon.

2287
01:23:53,179 --> 01:23:54,179
Congratulations.

2288
01:23:55,448 --> 01:23:57,118
- It's Jae Jin. - Jae Jin.

2289
01:23:57,118 --> 01:23:58,618
- You didn't pick Jae Jin. - I was very tempted.

2290
01:23:58,618 --> 01:24:00,448
- He stuck his tongue out. - I was very tempted.

2291
01:24:00,448 --> 01:24:01,889
- Unbelievable. - He stuck his tongue out.

2292
01:24:01,889 --> 01:24:03,289
I was very tempted,

2293
01:24:03,419 --> 01:24:05,959
but another member pulled at my heart.

2294
01:24:05,959 --> 01:24:06,959
It's incredible that you didn't pick Jae Jin.

2295
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:08,228
If you didn't pick Jae Jin...

2296
01:24:08,698 --> 01:24:10,459
I am sure you are beginning to get nervous.

2297
01:24:11,268 --> 01:24:12,929
- Se Chan is out. - Okay!

2298
01:24:13,129 --> 01:24:14,599
This is incredible.

2299
01:24:14,599 --> 01:24:15,599
(Jong Kook, Jae Seok, Seok Jin, and So Min remain.)

2300
01:24:15,599 --> 01:24:16,839
I will be good to you.

2301
01:24:16,839 --> 01:24:18,068
(Jong Kook, Jae Seok, Seok Jin, and So Min remain.)

2302
01:24:18,068 --> 01:24:20,039
Let's draw the curtain now.

2303
01:24:20,039 --> 01:24:21,738
(I am dying to know.)

2304
01:24:21,738 --> 01:24:23,608
- I will leave out one more person. - Please do that.

2305
01:24:24,709 --> 01:24:27,818
- Seok Jin is out. - Why?

2306
01:24:27,818 --> 01:24:30,318
(Screaming)

2307
01:24:30,318 --> 01:24:32,188
- Why didn't you leave me out? - Congratulations.

2308
01:24:32,188 --> 01:24:33,789
Why didn't you leave me out?

2309
01:24:34,049 --> 01:24:35,059
My goodness.

2310
01:24:35,059 --> 01:24:36,419
- Why? - What?

2311
01:24:36,419 --> 01:24:38,358
Why didn't you leave me out?

2312
01:24:38,358 --> 01:24:40,898
(They are the ones who pulled Kwang Soo's heart.)

2313
01:24:40,898 --> 01:24:42,358
Why me?

2314
01:24:42,358 --> 01:24:43,459
The three of you.

2315
01:24:43,459 --> 01:24:45,698
- Why? - I didn't do anything today.

2316
01:24:45,898 --> 01:24:47,129
I remained innocent.

2317
01:24:47,129 --> 01:24:48,368
- Why me? - Let's take a look.

2318
01:24:48,368 --> 01:24:50,039
Jong Kook might get chosen.

2319
01:24:50,339 --> 01:24:51,839
Jong Kook might get chosen.

2320
01:24:51,839 --> 01:24:52,839
(Who gets the penalty with Kwang Soo?)

2321
01:24:52,839 --> 01:24:54,209
- One... - Maybe it's So Min.

2322
01:24:54,209 --> 01:24:56,978
- Two. - I didn't do anything today.

2323
01:24:58,648 --> 01:25:05,448
(It's time to reveal who is inside Kwang Soo's heart.)

2324
01:25:05,448 --> 01:25:09,789
(Who is the one to get hit by the water bomb?)

2325
01:25:10,459 --> 01:25:11,528
(Jong Kook is chosen.)

2326
01:25:11,528 --> 01:25:12,528
Is it Jong Kook?

2327
01:25:12,528 --> 01:25:14,328
(Jong Kook is chosen.)

2328
01:25:16,099 --> 01:25:18,728
(For goodness' sake.)

2329
01:25:18,728 --> 01:25:19,728
Really?

2330
01:25:20,429 --> 01:25:21,499
Bye.

2331
01:25:21,639 --> 01:25:23,368
This is scary.

2332
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:26,068
Jong Kook said that he caught a cold.

2333
01:25:26,068 --> 01:25:27,738
Earlier,

2334
01:25:27,738 --> 01:25:28,978
he said he would prefer suffering the penalty today.

2335
01:25:28,978 --> 01:25:30,139
- Hold on. - Let me think.

2336
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:31,809
- He said... - May I look at the cameras?

2337
01:25:31,809 --> 01:25:33,009
- May I look at the cameras? - Hold on.

2338
01:25:33,009 --> 01:25:35,179
I didn't do anything to Kwang Soo today.

2339
01:25:35,179 --> 01:25:37,648
He usually wants to get picked. For the first time today,

2340
01:25:37,719 --> 01:25:39,618
- he really didn't want to get picked. - Hold on.

2341
01:25:39,618 --> 01:25:41,358
Hold on. Hold on.

2342
01:25:41,358 --> 01:25:43,188
- Today... - He didn't want to get picked.

2343
01:25:43,188 --> 01:25:45,289
Today, I didn't do anything to Kwang Soo.

2344
01:25:45,528 --> 01:25:46,959
- What did I do? - He has always welcomed...

2345
01:25:46,959 --> 01:25:48,599
- the penalties. - Hold on.

2346
01:25:49,028 --> 01:25:50,198
However, he hated the idea today.

2347
01:25:50,198 --> 01:25:51,198
- Is that it? - Yes.

2348
01:25:51,198 --> 01:25:52,768
- You chose me for that reason. - I knew it was my chance.

2349
01:25:53,169 --> 01:25:55,198
A chance like this might never come again.

2350
01:25:55,738 --> 01:25:58,608
All right. Okay. All right.

2351
01:25:58,738 --> 01:26:00,339
It came back alive.

2352
01:26:00,339 --> 01:26:04,249
My passion for Running Man came alive.

2353
01:26:04,349 --> 01:26:05,408
(Thank you for awakening my passion.)

2354
01:26:05,408 --> 01:26:06,408
That's good.

2355
01:26:07,249 --> 01:26:08,879
- That's good. - Seriously.

2356
01:26:09,349 --> 01:26:11,688
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

2357
01:26:11,688 --> 01:26:17,118
(Congratulations on the prize money as well as the water bomb.)

2358
01:26:17,188 --> 01:26:20,528
Money doesn't necessarily bring happiness.

2359
01:26:21,599 --> 01:26:23,898
Let's move to the location of the water bomb.

2360
01:26:23,898 --> 01:26:25,198
It's going to be cold.

2361
01:26:25,368 --> 01:26:26,868
Jong Kook.

2362
01:26:27,368 --> 01:26:28,368
He chose me.

2363
01:26:30,198 --> 01:26:32,068
- Everyone is here, right? - Yes.

2364
01:26:32,539 --> 01:26:35,278
It's time to get started with the penalty.

2365
01:26:35,379 --> 01:26:37,749
We had heated up the water.

2366
01:26:37,749 --> 01:26:39,309
However, as you can see,

2367
01:26:39,509 --> 01:26:41,679
the water is freezing right away.

2368
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:43,249
(The cold weather freezes the hot water as soon as it drips.)

2369
01:26:43,478 --> 01:26:45,289
I want to receive the penalty today.

2370
01:26:45,419 --> 01:26:48,219
If you get hit with the water,

2371
01:26:48,219 --> 01:26:50,118
you will bleed.

2372
01:26:50,118 --> 01:26:52,328
He will bleed anyway.

2373
01:26:52,328 --> 01:26:54,698
(He will bleed anyway.)

2374
01:26:54,698 --> 01:26:56,259
- What are you talking about? - He will bleed anyway.

2375
01:26:56,259 --> 01:26:57,929
- What are you talking about? - It's nothing.

2376
01:26:57,929 --> 01:26:59,328
- Why would I bleed? - Please don't say that.

2377
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,368
- What is wrong with you? - I mean...

2378
01:27:00,368 --> 01:27:02,238
Since he will bleed anyway,

2379
01:27:02,339 --> 01:27:03,799
wouldn't it be better to receive the penalty?

2380
01:27:04,339 --> 01:27:06,738
- Let's bleed. - All right.

2381
01:27:06,738 --> 01:27:08,908
(What is wrong with them?)

2382
01:27:08,908 --> 01:27:11,648
Anyway, Kwang Soo and Jong Kook,

2383
01:27:11,648 --> 01:27:15,249
you will receive the penalty the next time.

2384
01:27:15,249 --> 01:27:17,148
(The penalty gets pushed back.)

2385
01:27:17,148 --> 01:27:19,318
We should do it when the water melts.

2386
01:27:19,318 --> 01:27:21,318
This will weigh on my mind every day.

2387
01:27:21,318 --> 01:27:23,858
- "When will it happen?" - Before it ends...

2388
01:27:25,028 --> 01:27:28,228
For a year, the production crew and the members...

2389
01:27:28,629 --> 01:27:32,368
of Running Man ran hard.

2390
01:27:32,368 --> 01:27:35,039
The viewers told us that the show is fun...

2391
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:36,299
and sent us their support.

2392
01:27:36,299 --> 01:27:37,839
- It gave us energy. - That's right.

2393
01:27:37,839 --> 01:27:40,639
Next year, we will run even harder.

2394
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:44,009
- Happy New Year! - Happy New Year!

2395
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:45,408
Happy New Year!

2396
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:47,509
(Happy New Year!)

2397
01:27:47,818 --> 01:27:50,118
(It's time.)

2398
01:27:50,118 --> 01:27:52,448
(The year of 2018)

2399
01:27:52,448 --> 01:27:53,818
(Everyone, )

2400
01:27:53,818 --> 01:27:55,318
(do you want to know the future?)

2401
01:27:55,318 --> 01:27:56,518
(The best fortune comes together.)

2402
01:27:56,518 --> 01:27:57,959
(The worst fortune comes together.)

2403
01:27:58,228 --> 01:28:00,328
(The Fortune)

2404
01:28:00,328 --> 01:28:01,528
(Are they compatible enough...)

2405
01:28:01,528 --> 01:28:03,929
(to get married?)

2406
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:05,469
They might live together.

2407
01:28:05,469 --> 01:28:07,429
While you have a handsome face,

2408
01:28:07,429 --> 01:28:09,839
you have a perverted disposition.

2409
01:28:09,839 --> 01:28:12,268
(His fortune for 2018 is terrible.)

2410
01:28:13,709 --> 01:28:15,839
(Who called me unlucky?)

2411
01:28:15,839 --> 01:28:18,809
(Look at how I have changed.)

2412
01:28:18,809 --> 01:28:21,078
(The former lucky ones leave...)

2413
01:28:21,078 --> 01:28:23,018
(and the new lucky ones emerge.)

2414
01:28:23,018 --> 01:28:25,289
(The New Year Fortune)
