1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,210
It's Running Man's new year project.

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,890
It's Member's Week.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,760
The second member to participate in the project is Kim Jong Kook.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,190
(Kim Jong Kook)

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,300
(Did you decide what your episode will be about?)

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,060
(I will leave it in the hands of the crew.)

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,660
(Everyone wants only one thing from Jong Kook.)

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,790
(This year will be the right time for him.)

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,900
(He even talks about finding his love.)

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,690
(Why don't you get married through Running Man?)

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,490
(Marriage?)

12
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,830
- You look so red. - Let's help him out today.

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,730
(This is why we have prepared this episode.)

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,290
(This week's special is Marrying Jong Kook Off.)

15
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,130
If you wait there, I will be there shortly.

16
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,230
(At least for today, he's not the Jong Kook we know.)

17
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,790
(Jong Kook, who only cares about love, is at the best age to marry.)

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:02,060
(Will our Jong Kook be able to meet his bride?)

19
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,960
(Although it is freezing, hearts feel warm.)

20
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,690
It is 2017's Running Man's new year project.

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,690
The second member of the Member's Week...

22
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,230
is Kim Jong Kook.

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,600
Jong Kook left the theme of this week's episode...

24
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,430
in our hands.

25
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,490
That's why we have prepared the second episode of the Member's Week.

26
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,330
(What is it?)

27
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,760
We came up with this as we wished he would meet his love this year.

28
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,130
It's a project for his first blind date.

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,190
It's Marrying Jong Kook Off.

30
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,890
- That's right. It's about time. - But this is...

31
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,130
- He really has to get married now. - I seriously agree.

32
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,460
- He wants to date this year. - Right.

33
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,430
- Of course. - I hope...

34
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,690
the blind date goes well and he won't be as angry as he is now.

35
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,660
It's caused by hysterics of being an old bachelor.

36
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,530
- It's true. - I say this because he isn't here.

37
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,330
We talk about this a lot.

38
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,630
We must do something about his temper.

39
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,190
- It'll be good for everyone. - Seriously.

40
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,760
He must find a good woman.

41
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,260
- Everyone will be happy. - That's right.

42
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,460
How possible will it be?

43
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,060
Look at him dressed up.

44
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,560
He's very dressed up.

45
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,630
(What is he wearing for his blind date?)

46
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,060
(Good morning, everyone.)

47
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,260
(Jong Kook looks very fancy today.)

48
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,890
- He dyed his hair. - You're wearing a coat.

49
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,960
Why did you put red lipstick on?

50
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,190
- No, I didn't. - He's blushing.

51
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,460
(Jong Kook likes to dress up.)

52
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,430
- You look great. - You're so determined today.

53
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,590
Why didn't you dress up like this for my wedding?

54
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,860
He wore gym clothes all the time.

55
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,460
(He didn't look as fancy at the award ceremonies.)

56
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,060
Dressing up is the least he can do.

57
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,430
- That's what I'd do. - I think he looks great.

58
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,530
- It's perfect. It isn't too much. - Do I look okay?

59
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,230
- It's just right. - I'm not overdressed, right?

60
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,290
- You should be on a date already. - This is hilarious.

61
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,990
He's going on a blind date with this on his back.

62
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,430
(He wears a name tag on his blind date.)

63
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,160
Why did you put it on?

64
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,360
- You're going on a blind date. - Why does he have a name tag?

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,060
We're wearing the same color.

66
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,560
- You're not overdressed. - The tear on his pants makes him...

67
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,960
look like a bad boy.

68
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,760
(The tear gives him a bad boy look.)

69
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,430
Your coat is covered with dust.

70
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,560
I'm okay.

71
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,460
- You need it. - I'm fine.

72
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,260
- Do it on this side, too. - You need to get rid of dust...

73
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,060
on your coat.

74
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,160
(Kwang Soo is worried about his knees.)

75
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,460
- What are you doing? Stop it. - Cover up your knees.

76
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,430
- I can cover them up. - Why would you?

77
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,060
(Your knees will get cold.)

78
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,860
It's too cold.

79
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,290
Jong Kook's blind date will be aired for the first time.

80
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,390
For his date to be successful,

81
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,890
we need help from all the members.

82
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,960
We prepared two types of dates of opposite qualities.

83
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,160
(There are two types of date.)

84
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,630
Depending on whether the members clear the mission,

85
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,260
what Jong Kook does on his date will change.

86
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,530
We must clear the mission for Jong Kook's date...

87
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,130
to enjoy a great time.

88
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,630
Do well today as if your life depends on it.

89
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,360
Jong Kook is very serious today.

90
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,290
- Please do your best today. - Okay.

91
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,960
Don't worry. I'm good at matchmaking.

92
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,460
- Don't do it. - Please don't.

93
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,690
- Don't do it. - We'll definitely succeed today.

94
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,060
I know everything about dating.

95
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,060
He tricked me several times.

96
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,460
(Jae Seok is speaking nonsense.)

97
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,260
(Everyone, please stop.)

98
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,730
- Don't worry about a thing. - I can be your wedding planner.

99
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,160
Jae Seok and Haha, please focus on clearing the missions.

100
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,560
Don't be so tactless.

101
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,560
- He's lucky to meet us today. - You're being so tactless.

102
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,960
- You don't have to do a thing. - Don't do anything!

103
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,190
Okay.

104
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,490
The blind date is coming up soon.

105
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,190
- Here's your first mission. - What is it?

106
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,730
It'll determine the mode of transportation to pick up...

107
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,630
- his date. - This is important.

108
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,630
Since it's the first mission, it'll depend on Jong Kook's performance.

109
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,760
(It depends on Jong Kook's performance.)

110
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,690
Within 60 seconds, pull the van with 5 members in it...

111
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,360
up to the flag in front of the vehicle of your choice.

112
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,160
- I have to pull the van? - He needs to pull the van?

113
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,890
(Must he pull the van?)

114
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,560
- He's not an ox. - He has a blind date coming up.

115
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,460
For today,

116
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,630
I'm going to stay calm.

117
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,730
- I won't get angry. - You aren't getting angry.

118
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,860
I decided to stay calm today.

119
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,860
I was surprised that you didn't get angry.

120
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,890
(He slaps him.)

121
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,160
You should always stay calm like this.

122
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,530
(He tries to tolerate everything.)

123
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,730
This is what you need.

124
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,060
The first mode of transportation at 5m is...

125
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,360
a scooter.

126
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
(It's a scooter.)

127
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,300
- It's too cold to ride a scooter. - It's too cold.

128
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,890
There's a van at 10m.

129
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,260
To make the first meeting less awkward,

130
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,860
you'll ride the van with five other members.

131
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,290
- This is it. - What did you say?

132
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,760
- You'll succeed with this. - This is it.

133
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,260
- This is the answer. - You could even get married today.

134
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,530
- Of course. - I have to ride with them?

135
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,660
If you move the van 15m, you can use a car.

136
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,960
While having a conversation in private,

137
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,460
you can move to the next destination.

138
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,260
(He wants the car.)

139
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:54,730
(The first impression of Jong Kook depends on the result.)

140
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,190
(Five members get in the van.)

141
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,860
It won't be easy to pull this van.

142
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,560
It won't be easy at all.

143
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,190
(He's been attending weddings for 20 years.)

144
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,990
(He wants his own wedding this time.)

145
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,130
The time limit is one minute.

146
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,290
- Let's go. - You can do it, Jong Kook.

147
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,730
You can do it, Jong Kook.

148
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,290
- You can do it. - You can do it.

149
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,560
Get ready.

150
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,060
- Start. - You can do it.

151
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,890
Let's get married, Jong Kook.

152
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,660
Imagine that there's a cliff behind you.

153
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,060
(Which mode of transportation will he get?)

154
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,060
(The mission starts.)

155
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,430
(He pulls with all his might.)

156
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,630
(Everyone is desperate.)

157
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,860
Let's get married, Jong Kook.

158
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,430
(Jong Kook is good at everything except love.)

159
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,860
(What's going on?)

160
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,660
- This is difficult. - It isn't easy.

161
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,160
It's not easy.

162
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,290
(10 seconds passed.)

163
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,660
(The van hasn't even budged.)

164
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,760
(He must move the van.)

165
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,260
It's not working.

166
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,190
It's impossible to pull this alone.

167
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,130
(The van moves slightly.)

168
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,190
- You're doing well. - We're moving.

169
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,260
(Wait for me, my future love.)

170
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,360
(Jong Kook will get married.)

171
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,290
- We're moving. - He's amazing.

172
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,860
(He starts to pick up speed.)

173
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,260
It's working.

174
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,730
He's amazing.

175
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,190
I can't believe we played Name Tag Elimination with him.

176
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,290
I've tried it before, but it isn't easy.

177
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,790
When he's close to the van, step on the brakes.

178
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,360
Jong Kook needs us.

179
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,660
(The van moves easily.)

180
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,630
Let's ride with him.

181
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,790
(Will he win the car?)

182
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,060
- We need to stop him. - This is amazing.

183
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,360
- We need to stop him. - Why?

184
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,560
(He struggles.)

185
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,860
Why?

186
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,890
Why isn't it moving suddenly?

187
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,630
(The van was definitely moving.)

188
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,160
(You need us, Jong Kook.)

189
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,690
- Let's ride with him. - Can I step on the brakes?

190
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,630
Don't step on the brakes.

191
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,260
(Kwang Soo removes his foot a little late.)

192
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,630
(Only 13 seconds remain.)

193
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,960
Let's ride with him.

194
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,860
- Keep going, Jong Kook. - 10, 9.

195
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,890
Hey.

196
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,630
(He only has 10 seconds.)

197
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:03,560
(Two married men meddled in Jong Kook's business.)

198
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,630
(He laughed in disbelief.)

199
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,060
(Kwang Soo falls in love too easily.)

200
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,560
(It's the worst combination possible.)

201
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,130
(Riding the van with them will ruin his date.)

202
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,560
(He can't give up now.)

203
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,430
- 10, 9. - Hey.

204
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,060
(His love depends on the last 8 seconds.)

205
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,360
In 7, 6.

206
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,730
(It's a ride with five members...)

207
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,460
(versus a car only with his date.)

208
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,890
- This is incredible. - Three.

209
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,190
(He doesn't want to ruin his date.)

210
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,900
One.

211
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,190
Three.

212
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,860
(What's the result of the first mission?)

213
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,060
Hey.

214
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,860
(We'll help you with your date.)

215
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,160
Two.

216
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,230
One.

217
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,330
Jong Kook's mode of transportation...

218
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,960
is...

219
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,660
the van with five other members.

220
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,360
(They're excited to meet his date.)

221
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,060
How did he pull this van?

222
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,060
(He's disappointed.)

223
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,260
Don't feel pressured. Pretend like we aren't here.

224
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,330
- We're invisible. - We'll stay quiet.

225
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,630
It turned out well. We'll help him out.

226
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,360
- Okay. - It gives us something to do.

227
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,730
Here's the name and the number of your blind date.

228
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,960
(He gets happy again.)

229
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,960
I'm about to lose my mind with excitement.

230
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,660
My heart is fluttering.

231
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,900
(Where is his love?)

232
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,990
(At that time in Dosan Park)

233
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,460
(She's waiting for Jong Kook with full excitement.)

234
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,260
(Will they become a couple?)

235
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,660
(Jong Kook goes to pick her up.)

236
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,160
I feel excited about Jong Kook's blind date.

237
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,960
How long has it been since your last blind date?

238
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,290
- On TV? - Isn't it your first time on TV?

239
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,360
I've never been on a date on TV.

240
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,490
Some meet on TV shows and get married.

241
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,860
- Right. - Today might be that day.

242
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,730
This is just a blind date.

243
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,360
Did you meet your wife on a blind date?

244
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,960
- Me? - Did you approach her?

245
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,790
- No, he seduced her. - What happened?

246
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,560
Come on, that can't be.

247
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,630
(Jae Seok is good at picking up women.)

248
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,560
(He invited her wife to eat a bowl of soup.)

249
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,990
- You're right, Jong Kook. - Right?

250
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,730
No, you didn't.

251
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,460
- It sounds funny. - It may seem strange for Jae Seok.

252
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,160
However, it's true.

253
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,430
- Jong Kook, if I like your date, - Tell me.

254
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,760
I'll drink some water as soon as she gets in the van.

255
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,290
- You will? - Who cares what you think?

256
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,560
I think you're misunderstanding something.

257
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,190
This isn't your blind date.

258
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,190
Why would you do that?

259
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,660
(Seok Jin keeps thinking he's the main member today.)

260
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,900
As your big brother, if I like your date...

261
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,790
- You aren't my real brother. - We're still close.

262
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,960
Listen, Jong Kook.

263
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,630
If Seok Jin tries to do something bad,

264
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,860
I'll splash water on him.

265
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,160
- I'm being serious. - I won't do anything bad.

266
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,560
I have my best intentions for Jong Kook.

267
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,860
I'll be on your date's side.

268
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,260
Your future wife might feel excluded.

269
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,590
- I was about to slap you. - Why?

270
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,560
You'll make her feel pressured if you call her that.

271
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,960
- She has to like Jong Kook, too. - Of course.

272
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,560
- How shall I call her? - She has to like me, too.

273
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,430
I just hope Kwang Soo doesn't fall in love with her.

274
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,060
Come on, what are you talking about?

275
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,360
- He'd better not fall in love. - No way.

276
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,890
Don't fall in love with her.

277
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,730
You'd better not fall in love easily.

278
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,190
Even my mom says that about me.

279
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,360
She likes that nickname.

280
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,160
- She knows the truth. - "Come and eat, Kwang Soo."

281
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,360
"Wake up, Kwang Soo, who easily falls in love."

282
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,460
(She must be proud of her son.)

283
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,860
We're here.

284
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,960
Shouldn't you call her?

285
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,060
- Should I? - Tell her that you're on your way.

286
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,290
It's better to call before.

287
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,160
- Send her a short message. - We're almost there.

288
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,160
- Should I call her? - Tell her you're on your way.

289
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,160
(He presses her number first.)

290
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,090
- You must call her. - You should call her first.

291
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,090
Just call her once.

292
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,790
- I want to hear her voice. - Call her first.

293
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,160
Be quiet.

294
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,230
(Everyone, be quiet!)

295
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,460
You have to wait in front.

296
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,160
Are you calling her?

297
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,430
What song is that?

298
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,260
- Jong Kook. - It's Han Dong Geun.

299
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,160
- Hello? - She has a lovely voice.

300
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,530
- It's Han Dong Geun. - She has a lovely voice.

301
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,260
Hello, I'm Kim Jong Kook. Is this So Young?

302
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,460
Yes, hello.

303
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,990
She sounds young.

304
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,290
Isn't it cold? Are you outdoors?

305
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,730
Yes.

306
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,890
- We're almost there. - I'll be there soon.

307
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,530
- I wonder what she looks like. - We're here already.

308
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,730
I'm so curious.

309
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,260
- This is so... - You need to smile.

310
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,430
- Careful. - Watch out.

311
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,190
- Where is she? - In the park somewhere.

312
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,660
Her voice is so pretty.

313
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,030
She sounded so young.

314
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,030
- Jong Kook. - She's too young.

315
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,930
We're here. Go and get her.

316
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,090
- Where is she? - The park's that way.

317
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,960
- She sounds so young. - I'll be right back.

318
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,990
See you.

319
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,730
- Shall I go with you? - I'll leave this here.

320
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,890
Why would you come along?

321
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,030
That really hurt.

322
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,990
- Why? - Good luck.

323
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,530
Good luck.

324
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,290
- Get going. - Jae Seok.

325
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:51,830
Bring her over.

326
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,930
(He's very nervous.)

327
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,030
My goodness.

328
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,530
Why am I dressed like this?

329
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,260
(It's their first date and everything's bothering him.)

330
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,360
(He looks around while taking nervous strides.)

331
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
- He's on the move. - He's walking splay-footed.

332
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,660
- That's his gait. - A mobster walk.

333
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,890
Where is she?

334
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,260
(Intense nerves)

335
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,360
I should call and ask where she is.

336
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,660
(He's sorry to make her wait.)

337
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:25,830
(The lady he's searching for is very nearby.)

338
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,060
(Hey.)

339
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,090
(Grinning)

340
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,190
Hang on.

341
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,430
Is it the lady in the burgundy coat?

342
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:42,860
(A lady is wearing the same colored coat he is. Could it be her?)

343
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,160
It's her.

344
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,560
(She answers her phone.)

345
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,360
- Hello? - Hi.

346
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,360
Hi.

347
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,660
I'm... I'll be right there.

348
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,460
- Okay, see you. - I'll see you soon.

349
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,260
(He's 10 seconds away and on his way to meet her.)

350
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,960
What should I do? Our coats are the same color.

351
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,030
(Are they meant to be?)

352
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,430
(The unintended fact is making his heart pound.)

353
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,060
How... Is this possible?

354
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,530
(This is the blind date everyone wished for.)

355
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:23,660
(Let's meet the special guest who made all this possible.)

356
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,260
(This is who today's show is all about.)

357
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,360
(Jeong So Young, 29, accountant)

358
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,460
This is crazy.

359
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,260
(He feels so nervous.)

360
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:42,860
(As he walks up to her, she turns and they make eye contact.)

361
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,560
(Smiling)

362
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:45,990
Hello.

363
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,760
Hello.

364
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,790
(Such awkwardness)

365
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,430
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

366
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,360
- Our coats are the same color. - I know, I was so surprised.

367
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,560
- Hello. - I'm pleased to meet you.

368
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,460
(I'm Kim Jong Kook.)

369
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,290
- Same colors? - They dressed like a couple.

370
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,660
- She's in burgundy, too. - She is.

371
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,290
- Do you feel cold? - A bit.

372
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,290
- I'm so sorry. - The weather's nice, though.

373
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:15,430
(The main couple of today's episode finally meet.)

374
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,730
Did you get here early?

375
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,030
- No, not that early. - Not that early.

376
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:27,060
(We've never seen Jong Kook this shy before.)

377
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,760
- Sorry to have made you wait. - It's fine.

378
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,660
The previous shoot got delayed.

379
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,060
(Jong Kook talks to help her relax in front of the camera.)

380
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,090
The others are waiting in the car.

381
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,860
- Are they really? - Yes.

382
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,060
- They must tag along. - Really?

383
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,730
(She's never met a guy who brought five friends.)

384
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,830
They're coming.

385
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,360
Reverse a bit.

386
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,730
They're coming.

387
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,260
Should I open the door?

388
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,760
He'll open it for her.

389
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,090
Don't do anything.

390
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,530
- Shall I help? - Sit still.

391
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,260
Let Jong Kook take care of it.

392
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,790
Let him deal with it.

393
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,260
- I'm embarrassed to death. - Me, too.

394
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,160
The color of our coats...

395
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,360
Mine even has a name tag.

396
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,890
It might be a bit too much for you.

397
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,560
(Get married, Jong Kook!)

398
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,160
Is this too much?

399
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,890
Shall I take it off?

400
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,290
Let's take this off. It's too much.

401
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,060
It's...

402
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:24,930
Just a moment.

403
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,160
(Now it gets worse.)

404
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,990
- Hello. - Welcome!

405
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,190
- So Young. - Hello, So Young.

406
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,530
Have a seat.

407
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,790
- Sit here. - Welcome.

408
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,460
- I should go inside. - Right.

409
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,360
- Welcome. - Hello.

410
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,790
Was the step this high up?

411
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,430
Welcome on board.

412
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,190
Welcome, So Young.

413
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,990
Nice to meet you.

414
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,560
- It's nice to meet you. - Hello.

415
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,160
I'm so pleased you agreed to meet Jong Kook.

416
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,030
- Thanks so much. - Hello.

417
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,360
It's fate.

418
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,160
The possibility of this happening...

419
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,890
I hope to see you more often.

420
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,730
- Now... - Have you eaten?

421
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,030
You need to eat.

422
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,530
I only had breakfast so far.

423
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,160
You must be so hungry.

424
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,030
We'll set off, then.

425
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,790
(The team head over to the restaurant.)

426
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,030
I think So Young would look great in a hanbok.

427
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,760
- Do you want her to change? - No.

428
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,260
Watch what you say.

429
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,430
- Seok Jin. - You're so silly.

430
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,930
She's a typical Asian beauty.

431
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,660
Did you leave early this morning? Do you live far away?

432
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,890
I live near Sindorim.

433
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,160
- Sindorim? - Sindorim?

434
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,060
It's right next to Yeouido.

435
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,990
You don't have to say things like that.

436
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,260
- I work in Yeouido. - Do you?

437
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,930
Are you in securities or stocks?

438
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,030
I'm an accountant.

439
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,460
- An accountant? - An accountant...

440
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,660
The CPA?

441
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,460
Oh, my gosh.

442
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,530
It's not your blind date.

443
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,100
Why are you so shocked?

444
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,260
Sorry, but I studied Business Management...

445
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,460
and I know how hard that exam is.

446
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,560
It's the economics equivalent of the bar exam.

447
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,260
- I'm impressed. - CPA?

448
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,260
Do you have any siblings?

449
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,990
- Be quiet. - Let Jong Kook ask that later.

450
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,260
You're so rude.

451
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,260
You asked something Jong Kook should during lunch.

452
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,190
- I have an older brother. - I have a younger sister.

453
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,190
- A younger sister? - So do I.

454
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,260
(We have something in common!)

455
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,890
Who cares? Jae Seok, I whacked him on the head.

456
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,790
Well done. I have two younger sisters.

457
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,290
They look like him.

458
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,030
Hey!

459
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,830
It's true. Family members look alike.

460
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,660
I want to know her blood type.

461
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,260
I want to ask her age.

462
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,830
Sorry.

463
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,260
- I apologize. - She has to be within range.

464
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,530
We're against this if you're too young.

465
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,190
- Why are you against it? - What right do you have?

466
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,460
Why are you against it?

467
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,360
We're in no position to be against anything.

468
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:37,060
- I was born in early 1989. - Early 1989?

469
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,160
- We're 12 years apart. - We are.

470
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,630
We have the same Chinese zodiac.

471
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,190
(It's a perfect match.)

472
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,430
- This is great. - I don't believe this.

473
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,160
How old is your sister?

474
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,760
- She just turned 27. - Did she?

475
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,960
My brother's two years older.

476
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,060
- He's a plastic surgeon near here. - I see.

477
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,360
He's really sweet.

478
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,060
(He had no idea then...)

479
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:04,100
(that his sweet brother would visit the restaurant.)

480
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,530
(There's no need to say that on a blind date.)

481
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,160
(Facts become vicious weapons.)

482
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,560
(Do you hate him sometimes?)

483
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,660
(Of course, I do.)

484
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,990
(The battle of the brothers is coming right up.)

485
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,100
I have so many questions.

486
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,860
There's so much we want to ask but we're holding back.

487
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,530
Do you feel uncomfortable?

488
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,190
No, right? You saw these people on telly.

489
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,360
"Telly"?

490
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,560
(He came all dressed up and used such an old-fashioned word.)

491
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,890
He said, "telly".

492
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:37,930
(The old-school singer just showed the limit of his vocabulary.)

493
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,660
"Telly"?

494
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,360
Unbelievable.

495
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,160
- "Telly." - He said, "telly".

496
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,190
(They finally reach the restaurant.)

497
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,560
We're here.

498
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,100
- You can get out. - Move it, Jong Kook.

499
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,930
Get the door for her.

500
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,360
No, wait!

501
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,660
Don't get out.

502
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,860
It's dangerous.

503
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,960
(Jong Kook's so chivalrous.)

504
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,260
Well done.

505
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,760
- Congratulations. - Get out.

506
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,990
Enjoy yourselves.

507
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,860
- Enjoy your meal. - Go on upstairs.

508
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:09,830
(We reserved a romantic restaurant where they can enjoy a meal.)

509
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:18,190
(The man and woman head to the room reserved just for them.)

510
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:19,890
- Welcome. - Hello.

511
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,760
- The room's on your right. - This way?

512
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,190
(Jong Kook opens the door for the lady.)

513
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,430
(They get some privacy at last.)

514
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,560
It's awkward, isn't it?

515
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,030
It's not too bad.

516
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,030
I felt the urge to protect her.

517
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:44,960
I wanted to look after her and protect her.

518
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,630
He seemed very masculine.

519
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,660
I like that he was so caring.

520
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,030
(The man and woman sit down for a private chat.)

521
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,160
What now?

522
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,290
(His brain formatted.)

523
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,060
- This situation's... - Yes?

524
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:03,360
- How did you end up doing this? - Pardon?

525
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,560
I've never been on what you'd call an average date.

526
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,890
I became a celebrity at a pretty young age.

527
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:16,460
- I hope you can understand. - Sure.

528
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,660
Should I open this?

529
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,290
It's a gift for you.

530
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,990
What were they thinking?

531
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,890
Hang on. This is...

532
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,560
It's your name tag. Why...

533
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,560
- On my coat? - Yes.

534
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,190
Let me.

535
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:37,190
(Let me put your name tag on for you.)

536
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,660
(So chivalrous)

537
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,990
I can't believe I'm doing this.

538
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,160
(We've never seen this side of him before.)

539
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,030
I wish he were just half as kind to us.

540
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,460
Less than half would do.

541
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,060
I wish he was 10 percent as nice to us.

542
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,090
Jong Kook's never put on my name tag for me. He's only ripped it.

543
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,130
And I never knew his voice was that soft.

544
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,330
- He's so kind. - He's whispering.

545
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,360
(He usually explodes.)

546
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,630
(He roared like a lion...)

547
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,560
(and preyed on the members for the past 7 years.)

548
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:16,230
(The tiger now turned as gentle as a lamb.)

549
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,030
His voice is so low.

550
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,790
He normally doesn't sound like that.

551
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,660
Today, we have a guest joining...

552
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,430
- for the blind date. - Who is it?

553
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,430
- Wasn't it just us? - Somebody's joining us?

554
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,560
- Why are you here? - Hey.

555
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,660
- Hello. - Hello.

556
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,430
- His brother is here. - Why is he here?

557
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,290
- Welcome. - Hello.

558
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,960
- Hello. - Aren't you working today?

559
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,930
- I cancelled an operation. - Really?

560
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,930
- Have a seat. - Thank you.

561
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,560
Jong Kook was just talking about you.

562
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,930
(As an insider, he knows Jong Kook more than anybody.)

563
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:50,860
(His brother is watching him.)

564
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,760
You must have some expectations for today.

565
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,960
I was actually close by. I got a call...

566
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,290
saying that he's on a blind date.

567
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,660
I came without telling him.

568
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,490
- I didn't even tell him. - That's her.

569
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,860
She's beautiful.

570
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,590
He will definitely like her.

571
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,830
- Exactly. - He's smiling.

572
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,760
I think he likes her.

573
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,590
(But in reality, )

574
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:17,960
(there's an awkward silence in between them.)

575
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,460
(What am I supposed to say?)

576
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,060
- It's a nice day today. - Right.

577
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,960
(Within one second, it's silent again.)

578
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,390
- Isn't this awkward? I think it is. - A little bit.

579
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,060
Have you been on many blind dates?

580
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,130
I wouldn't say many,

581
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,060
- but more than you did. I suspect. - Is that right?

582
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,860
(He starts the conversation but it stops again.)

583
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,890
How do we order?

584
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:48,430
(Please, we need food at least.)

585
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:51,590
Excuse me. Is there anybody here?

586
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,030
(He sounds so inexperienced.)

587
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,630
We'd like to order. Is there anybody here?

588
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,230
(Please save this poor lamb, waiter.)

589
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,660
He's so serious.

590
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,290
He's supposed to act witty.

591
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,990
I think it's important to make her feel comfortable...

592
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,860
- rather than make her laugh. - He doesn't want to joke too much.

593
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,030
- He's taking this very seriously. - For real.

594
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,530
- He's very serious. - I think he's too serious.

595
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,990
- Appetizer is ready. - Thank you.

596
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,990
(The waiter saved him.)

597
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,660
(The appetizer will hopefully make things less awkward.)

598
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,930
Thank you.

599
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,930
(The appetizer will hopefully make things less awkward.)

600
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,390
- Please eat. - Okay.

601
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,730
- Aren't you feeling uncomfortable? - No, it's okay.

602
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,360
- Jong Kook... - I think he likes her.

603
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,460
- really likes women who eat a lot. - That's right.

604
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,660
That's important.

605
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,530
What kind of food do you like to eat?

606
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,390
I don't think we eat similar kinds of food.

607
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,990
(What is she saying?)

608
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,860
Sorry? Why not?

609
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:49,230
I like to eat, but I like food that's not good for your health.

610
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,930
I don't smoke, drink or drink coffee,

611
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,530
but I like greasy food such as meat.

612
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,590
(This is his 1st crisis. They have opposite tastes in food.)

613
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:01,330
This isn't good. She likes food that's not good for you.

614
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,830
She likes greasy food.

615
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,490
I like greasy food.

616
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,760
I like meat.

617
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,990
- Really? - Yes. I like meat.

618
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,930
- Well... - I don't eat a lot of vegetables.

619
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,390
Really? You don't like vegetables?

620
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,730
(He fails to keep a straight face after hearing that.)

621
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,460
- You must eat a lot of meat. - Yes, I eat mostly meat.

622
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,860
I see. You need to eat a lot of vegetables.

623
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:24,360
- I try to eat a lot. - That's great.

624
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,360
I didn't eat a lot of vegetables when I was younger.

625
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,590
After I started eating vegetables,

626
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,060
my...

627
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,090
(He's a true health expert.)

628
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,530
My bowels are more regular.

629
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,730
It feels cleaner.

630
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:40,260
The key word of the blind date so far...

631
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,430
- is "health". - That's right.

632
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:46,760
Jong Kook is a health expert around here.

633
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,930
I don't know what...

634
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:53,230
- So Young will say about that. - Jong Myung,

635
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,160
- do you think he likes her? - I think he does.

636
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,990
- Right? - He doesn't usually say things...

637
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,060
about himself from when he was younger.

638
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,160
- He brought it up. - He kept on talking about it.

639
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,630
I think he likes her, too.

640
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,590
- What kind of food do you like? - Me?

641
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,660
(Let's see. What food do I like?)

642
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,930
(She's curious.)

643
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,860
(Let's look back on the type of food he ate in the past.)

644
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,090
You can only look at it.

645
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,730
(He doesn't even eat fried chicken.)

646
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,230
- I can't eat fried food. - Why not?

647
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,760
Do you know how much oil there is in jjajangmyeon?

648
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,290
(Stop nagging and just eat.)

649
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,060
(He hates oil but loves protein. What would he say?)

650
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,560
I am actually not...

651
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,290
that picky about food.

652
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,660
- He's lying. - That's a lie.

653
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,160
- That's a lie, right? - I don't think he's right.

654
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,260
He's so picky about food.

655
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,790
He doesn't eat anything that's delicious.

656
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,460
He even washes kimchi before he eats it. What is he saying?

657
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,530
(Jong Kook can only eat washed kimchi.)

658
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,890
He says Jong Kook is totally picky.

659
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:53,330
He's gotten better than before.

660
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,290
It's most important to find a common area of interest.

661
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,930
Is that right?

662
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,490
Do you usually work out during your time off?

663
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,490
I usually work out or my only hobby...

664
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:07,030
- is talking to my friends. - I see.

665
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,130
Do you like to travel?

666
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,290
- Sorry? - Travelling?

667
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,560
- I like to travel. - Do you?

668
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,330
- I love to travel. - Is that right?

669
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,760
Yes, I...

670
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,590
travel...

671
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,730
(He starts talking about travelling.)

672
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:19,730
whenever I have free time.

673
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,960
My destinations are limited though.

674
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,230
I usually go to LA in the States.

675
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,990
- I see. - Because...

676
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,490
You can't eat a lot...

677
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,330
- on the first date, right? - That's right.

678
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,760
That's what this is, right?

679
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,630
Women are like that.

680
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,360
You can't hear the other person when you eat at the same time.

681
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,960
That's why.

682
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:44,390
I have a lot of friends in LA. The streets are also similar.

683
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,660
For me, I usually travel to take breaks.

684
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:51,030
I don't...

685
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,530
go around a lot.

686
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:56,560
I go there, work out, rest,

687
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,930
and eat good food.

688
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,790
That's what I like to do.

689
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,230
- She's eating a lot. - She must be starving.

690
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,290
So Young must be really hungry.

691
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:08,060
- Exactly. - She's stuffing down a big piece...

692
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,730
- of lettuce. - She doesn't even care anymore.

693
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,030
It's the size of a hand.

694
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,660
I thought she was eating a huge burger.

695
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,260
Jong Kook is talking too much about himself.

696
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,490
- He's not listening to her. - She has to talk, too.

697
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,090
- She does. - He's talking too much.

698
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,360
He loves to talk.

699
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,290
Ask her to speak.

700
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,460
Ask her to speak.

701
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,930
(His audience yells at him for being carried away.)

702
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,060
- What did you just do? - I couldn't hold it.

703
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,430
- They heard you. - That was inside my head.

704
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,060
They heard you. They're chuckling.

705
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,430
Please listen to So Young.

706
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,090
Listen to So Young.

707
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,360
- I think they can hear us. - Really?

708
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,930
Listen to So Young.

709
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,460
The main dish has to come.

710
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,190
- That's right. - Right, Ji Hyo?

711
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,790
- Yes. - They had too much salad.

712
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,530
They'll be eating now.

713
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,930
Jong Kook's menu...

714
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:01,160
will be decided by you.

715
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,930
- I hope he eats something good. - It's important.

716
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,730
I have a game for you to play.

717
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,430
You can go down...

718
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,230
- and play. - Okay.

719
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,460
(Let's give them steak.)

720
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,830
(What game do they have to play to get steak?)

721
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,160
I think this will open up.

722
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,160
- What is this? - What's this?

723
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,930
(Why is this in the middle of the restaurant?)

724
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,030
What's this?

725
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,560
- What is this? - What's this?

726
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,590
- What is this? - What's this?

727
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,030
What's this?

728
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,730
(Why are there paper cups in the restaurant?)

729
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,260
- I hope he eats something good. - It's important.

730
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,330
What's this?

731
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:37,030
The mission is called, "Escape the Paper Mines".

732
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,660
(The mission is called "Escape the Paper Mines".)

733
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,590
This is the most important part of the meal.

734
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:41,960
What's this?

735
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,330
Three members will be blindfolded...

736
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:48,090
and walk across the paper mines in a row.

737
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:52,290
You can only move on to the next person within five steps.

738
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,660
The goal is to reach the finish line without touching the paper mines.

739
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,460
It's so difficult.

740
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,760
If you succeed,

741
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,390
- you'll get this premium steak. - It looks good.

742
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,860
If you don't,

743
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,960
you'll get this Pikachu tonkatsu, which is every child's favorite.

744
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,130
- Pikachu? - I hope he gets to eat steak.

745
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,890
We have to get steak.

746
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,060
Let's...

747
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,660
help him eat steak.

748
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,260
Kwang Soo, Jae Seok, and Ji Hyo can go.

749
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,130
- That's right. - Open the window.

750
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,890
Open the window, Jong Kook.

751
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,630
- Open the window. - Open the window, Jong Kook.

752
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,130
- Am I supposed to open this? - Jong Kook.

753
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,460
Okay. Hold on.

754
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,190
(He's forced to open the curtains.)

755
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,590
We're going to play a game.

756
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,590
How do you open this?

757
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,830
- This is how it opens. - Really?

758
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,190
- You need to pull. - You have to push.

759
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,390
- I have to push? - Yes.

760
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:45,890
- There's a string here. - Open it, then.

761
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:49,530
He usually gets mad but he's not today.

762
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,560
- Jong Kook. - Why are you not getting mad?

763
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,990
- What's wrong with you today? - Why aren't you getting mad?

764
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,630
- Sorry? - Are you in a good mood?

765
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,790
- Why are you not getting mad? - Why would I get mad?

766
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,130
- Why would I get mad? - What's this?

767
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,330
- Jong Kook. - Yes?

768
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,230
Can you be 10 percent as nice as you are today?

769
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,630
- Please. - Really.

770
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,560
- Okay. - This is touching.

771
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,930
- Why? - You're too nice.

772
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,260
- And then... - Seok Jin,

773
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,360
thank you for doing this in the cold weather.

774
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,890
- What? - Did he just thank him?

775
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,660
- What was that? - You can do it.

776
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,030
I'll make sure you have steak with So Young.

777
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,730
- This looks hard. - You can go first, Ji Hyo.

778
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,830
- Should I go first? - You have to pay attention.

779
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,060
- Start on your left foot. - We have to look.

780
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,330
- Let's get going. - So Young is watching.

781
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,490
Okay.

782
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,060
Watch us, So Young.

783
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,230
We're doing this so that you can have steak.

784
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,660
Ready.

785
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,030
Set...

786
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:44,230
(Don't worry, Jong Kook. I'll let you eat steak.)

787
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,660
Take a big step.

788
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,360
- Take a big step. - Bigger.

789
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,560
- Here? - Bring it down.

790
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,760
- Slow down. - No.

791
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,560
- Don't touch it. - No, that's not.

792
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,960
- That's good. - You're good.

793
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,860
- Put your foot down. - Slide your foot forward.

794
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,890
(He's nervous.)

795
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,930
- Put your foot down. - Slide your foot forward.

796
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:04,660
- Slide your left foot. - Slide a bit more. That's good.

797
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,930
- Excellent. - You're good.

798
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,230
(Thanks to the kind audio guide, she manages to pass through.)

799
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,430
- To your left. - It's on your left.

800
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,290
- It's on your left. - Is it here?

801
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,230
- No, stretch your leg more. - Move it.

802
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,430
- Not there! - No!

803
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,660
- Move it back a little. Lower it. - Move it back.

804
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,390
- To the back. - That's good. Lower it.

805
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,190
- Speak clearly. - Move it back.

806
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,190
(He fails to speak clearly.)

807
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,490
(They are all making a fuss.)

808
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:27,190
- You can put it down completely. - There you go.

809
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,090
- Slide your foot. - It's right here.

810
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,290
- Put your foot down. - It's on your right.

811
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:32,090
(The next spot doesn't have any cups.)

812
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,660
(He hits her leg.)

813
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,660
(She loses balance.)

814
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,030
(She was doing well, but she lost her balance.)

815
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,860
No. Don't do that.

816
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,830
(With one shake, he will end up with tonkatsu.)

817
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,060
Don't!

818
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,430
(She manages to get her balance back. She's an expert.)

819
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,490
(She only has 3 steps left.)

820
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,490
It's right in front of you.

821
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,460
- That's good. - Lower your foot.

822
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,660
- Lower it. - Slide it forward.

823
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,530
- Put your heel down. - Slide it forward.

824
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,560
- Slide it farther. - Push it forward more.

825
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,230
(There's a huge gap between her legs.)

826
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,960
You only have three steps left.

827
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,430
(Now she has to escape the paper mines within 2 steps.)

828
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,960
- It's on your left. - Just stretch your leg forward.

829
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,590
- Stretch it more. - Slide it more.

830
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,230
(The next target spot is closer than the last spot.)

831
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,130
- Lower your foot. - Hold on. Wait.

832
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,730
(She lands her foot by inches.)

833
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,330
- This is it. - She has to jump now.

834
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,430
(She longs for Ji Hyo's success.)

835
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,430
- Jump from where you are now. - Hold on.

836
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,960
- Is it this way? - Yes.

837
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,760
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

838
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,130
(If she succeeds, they will get a step closer to having a steak.)

839
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,130
(Jumping)

840
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,190
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

841
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,590
(She manages to escape without touching any cups.)

842
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:34,030
(If two more members succeed, they can have the delicious steak.)

843
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,460
- You did it. - I really couldn't see anything.

844
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,760
- Thank you. - Jong Kook, I succeeded.

845
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,330
- Nice. - I couldn't see anything.

846
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:43,230
- I will do it like this. - You can do it in three steps.

847
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,830
(He scans for possible routes.)

848
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,030
Try it. Practice.

849
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,660
- You can jump three times. - One, two,

850
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,630
- three, four. - There you go.

851
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,830
(It's nothing.)

852
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,090
You can do this.

853
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,090
(He smiles brightly.)

854
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,960
- Remember your steps. - Okay.

855
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,290
- I will succeed by any means. - Start with your left foot.

856
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,730
(I can succeed if I follow the route.)

857
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,930
I'm getting nervous.

858
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,930
(I still have 5 paper cups left.)

859
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,590
(So Young likes steaks.)

860
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,660
(Don't you worry. I will get you the steak.)

861
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,230
Start. Don't forget the steps.

862
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,790
(He steps on it.)

863
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,860
Remember the steps.

864
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,560
(There's a feast at the paper mines.)

865
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,830
One, two, three.

866
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,860
(Hey, Kwang Soo.)

867
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,730
- Three. - Remember the steps.

868
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,530
(He keeps stepping on the cups.)

869
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,430
- It's still a success. - I did it?

870
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:34,430
- It still counts as a success. - He stepped on four cups.

871
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,130
(He's the king of destruction.)

872
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,860
You are indeed the unluckiest member.

873
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,500
(I have a feeling we will eat tonkatsu.)

874
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,230
- Memorize the route, Jae Seok. - Okay. Hold on.

875
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,130
(If he steps on even a single cup, they will have tonkatsu.)

876
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,960
- Start from here. - He'll lose the sense of direction.

877
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,130
- Three members have to succeed? - Let me try it out first. Hold on.

878
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:54,290
- That's good. - One, two, three, four.

879
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,500
- He did it. - Just do what you just did.

880
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,930
Jae Seok, you can do it, right?

881
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:00,430
I can do it. Don't worry.

882
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:03,130
I will make sure you two eat the steak.

883
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:06,390
(If he steps on a cup, they will have to say goodbye to the steak.)

884
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,500
Here I go.

885
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,630
(Jae Seok tries it.)

886
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,530
- Start. - Start.

887
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:13,790
(Hold on. Wait. No way!)

888
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,130
- Start. - Start.

889
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:19,000
(He strides.)

890
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,060
One.

891
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:23,290
(I will let you have the steak.)

892
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,500
Three, four.

893
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,930
(Jae Seok succeeds at once at an incredible speed.)

894
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,660
(The mission is accomplished.)

895
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,060
This is unbelievable.

896
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,560
(Thank you, everyone.)

897
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,630
I can't believe this.

898
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,760
(He's like a mine detector. What a surprise.)

899
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,030
- This is incredible. - He did it.

900
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,830
(A wish to marry off Jong Kook has made a miracle.)

901
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,930
- How did he do this? - Jong Kook.

902
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,500
Isn't this wonderful?

903
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,830
(I told you I'd get you the steak.)

904
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,190
My goodness.

905
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,330
(I'm so touched, Jae Seok.)

906
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,290
You'll have the steak.

907
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,630
(Enjoy your steak.)

908
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,030
- I'm so glad it worked out. - Jae Seok, you were awesome.

909
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,760
- It was amazing. - Yes, it was.

910
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,760
(I respect you. You are a walking mine detector.)

911
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,860
How did he manage this?

912
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,960
(Jong Kook and So Young earn the steak.)

913
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,660
She likes eating meat.

914
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,430
- Thank you for the food. - Please enjoy.

915
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:12,830
(She takes a bite.)

916
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,860
(This is delicious.)

917
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,390
- This is good. - Is it?

918
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,560
Your cheek is bulging out.

919
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,660
(It's cute.)

920
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,000
You had a big bite.

921
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,660
His voice is so low that it might go underground.

922
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,590
Why doesn't he talk to us in that voice?

923
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,590
- I think he likes her. - I agree.

924
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,500
- Don't you think so? - I think so.

925
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,630
His face says so.

926
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:38,660
If he gets married, I should be the host for his wedding, right?

927
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,660
Haha should sing at the wedding.

928
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,030
- I can sing. - Seok Jin can, too.

929
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,760
- Count me in, Jae Seok. - I used to be a singer.

930
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,430
I also hosted Haha's sister's wedding.

931
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,130
- You did my sister's wedding, too. - Right, I did.

932
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:53,130
I hosted the wedding for Seok Jin's sister.

933
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:56,000
He said my father's name for the groom's name.

934
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,290
(He's a breaking up the family tree.)

935
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:00,760
He said, "The groom, Ji Chang Gyun." It's my father's name.

936
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,930
- I was... - We were so taken aback.

937
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,930
It was only my second wedding that I hosted.

938
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,430
I was a bit nervous.

939
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,790
At that time, I still got the butterflies in my stomach.

940
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,930
I said, "The groom, Ji Chang Gyun."

941
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,930
And his father said, "No. That's my name."

942
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:18,290
I apologized and I did it again.

943
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:21,030
I said the wrong name again and his father said it was wrong again.

944
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,290
(Even after his apology, he called out the wrong name.)

945
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,390
So you've been to South America.

946
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,500
How about the States? Have you been to the North America?

947
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,290
- I've been to San Francisco. - I see.

948
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:33,830
I was on a business trip to Mountain View near Silicon Valley.

949
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:34,830
(His eyes are gleaming.)

950
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,390
So I've been to San Francisco once.

951
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,630
(Should I have a bite now?)

952
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,000
How about Europe? Which countries have you been to in Europe?

953
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,230
(Please give me some time to chew.)

954
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,230
I'm sorry.

955
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,290
I asked when you just had your bite.

956
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,030
Please take your time.

957
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:53,730
On a blind date, it's only two of you. So you don't have time to eat.

958
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,530
You are supposed to eat and talk at the same time.

959
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,760
I think your mother would like Europe, too.

960
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,830
- I think she would. - Right.

961
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,290
Why don't you take her there?

962
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,130
I want to, but I don't think it's a place I should go with my mom.

963
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,960
You're right. She can go with your father.

964
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,660
The problem is...

965
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,230
my father doesn't like going on trips.

966
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,930
Your family is similar to mine.

967
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:15,290
That's why she's always alone...

968
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,860
and I can't bear to see her like that.

969
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,830
A lot of ladies may not like this,

970
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,430
but I go on a lot of trips with my mother.

971
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,230
(I should shut his mouth.)

972
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,960
That's true. He travels a lot with his mom.

973
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,460
- They go on too many trips. - He's the best son.

974
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,590
- But... - He shouldn't say that on a date.

975
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,430
My friend, Tae Hyun, always...

976
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,630
tells me not to say this to a woman.

977
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,630
He always says if I do, I won't be able to get married.

978
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,500
But there is a reason...

979
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,090
behind this.

980
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:47,830
My mother used to be sick.

981
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:50,760
She suffered from breast cancer.

982
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,460
When I was young and in high school,

983
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,760
I caused much trouble for her.

984
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,560
I always thought I should be a better son.

985
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,430
I worked as a singer for 1 or 2 years.

986
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:05,530
I thought I should succeed and make a lot of money...

987
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:08,890
so that I could do things for my mom and be a good son.

988
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,330
Then out of the blue, I heard the news.

989
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:14,390
I found out she was diagnosed with breast cancer.

990
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,860
I thought to myself that things don't go as I plan.

991
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:22,530
I thought time won't wait for me to get ready to take care of her.

992
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,190
I decided that I should take her on a trip starting that day.

993
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,130
So that's when it all started.

994
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:32,890
That was when I was 23 or 24 years old.

995
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,860
That's when we first started traveling together.

996
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,660
After going on that first trip,

997
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,230
we always go on trips together.

998
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,660
His love for his parents is incredible.

999
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,230
- Especially his love for his mom... - You're right.

1000
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,430
They go everywhere together.

1001
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:48,660
However, his girlfriend won't...

1002
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,590
- be pleased... - She might not like it.

1003
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,830
- if he goes on too many trips. - I can't stop him.

1004
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,090
That worries me a bit.

1005
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,660
He shouldn't say such a thing on a blind date.

1006
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:58,930
Right.

1007
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,330
My father used to work in the army.

1008
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,860
(He moves on talking about his father.)

1009
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,590
- I see. - That's why he is so righteous.

1010
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,090
(He talks flawlessly.)

1011
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,360
I used to hate it about him.

1012
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,230
(She's been listening to him for 30 minutes.)

1013
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,230
I hated it about him, and I acted the same.

1014
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,390
(Stop talking and ask her some questions.)

1015
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:16,030
Stop talking about yourself and ask her questions.

1016
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,530
They should get to know each other. He's been talking about himself.

1017
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:22,230
She can look it up online. Why is he telling her that?

1018
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,230
I had a big breakfast.

1019
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,460
(He's not done talking.)

1020
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,760
(He may end up publishing his autobiography.)

1021
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,330
- Is that so? - I had meat for breakfast.

1022
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,930
Stop talking about breakfast.

1023
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,190
She doesn't want to know about it.

1024
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:39,060
He should ask her about her ideal type and her preferences.

1025
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,860
- He should be asking these things. - Why don't we...

1026
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,190
text him and tell him this?

1027
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,560
- Why would I text him? - Ask her about her ideal type.

1028
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:48,290
Ask her about her ideal type and her last dating experience.

1029
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,790
(Resonating)

1030
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,630
(I won't get angry. So Young is sitting in front of me.)

1031
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,330
I will go and get Jong Kook.

1032
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:59,030
If he keeps this up, she might fall asleep.

1033
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,230
- You're right. - She might have her dinner as well.

1034
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,590
(The temperature between them is negative 10°C.)

1035
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,330
(Running Man Dating Agency)

1036
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:09,290
(Their target is Kim Jong Kook.)

1037
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,560
That's why I eat...

1038
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,290
(Jong Kook, look here.)

1039
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,530
(We need to talk.)

1040
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,730
(However, the target seems uninterested.)

1041
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:21,730
(Coughing)

1042
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,330
(He only focuses on the steak.)

1043
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:26,790
- I'm not good at languages. - Really?

1044
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:30,190
(He's frustrated.)

1045
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,290
(He tries to communicate with him through a sketchbook.)

1046
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,190
(Jong Kook, come to...)

1047
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,660
(I hope my heart can reach you.)

1048
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:40,860
(Jong Kook, come to the 2nd floor...)

1049
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,930
(Jong Kook, tell her that you are going to the restroom...)

1050
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,930
(and come to the 2nd floor.)

1051
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:49,030
(Jong Kook is clearly bad at blind dates.)

1052
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,790
(Kwang Soo summons him to the headquarters.)

1053
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:55,360
I wasn't talented in that field.

1054
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,560
- It was difficult. - He saw my message.

1055
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,460
My brother and I are very different.

1056
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,130
(He ignores what he saw.)

1057
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,130
I think he's ignoring it.

1058
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,890
(Kwang Soo writes again angrily.)

1059
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,130
(Why are you ignoring me?)

1060
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,830
(He turns the page.)

1061
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:21,390
(If you don't want to ruin your blind date, )

1062
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,760
(come to the second floor.)

1063
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:27,190
(He forces Jong Kook to come.)

1064
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,290
He saw it.

1065
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:35,890
(It's Kwang Soo's strange sketchbook.)

1066
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:42,160
I'm sorry, but I'll be right back. They're calling me.

1067
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,260
Okay.

1068
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:48,190
(Why are they interrupting me?)

1069
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,230
- What's wrong? - Let's go upstairs.

1070
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,360
What?

1071
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,360
What's wrong?

1072
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,830
Why did you call me? I'm doing well.

1073
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:57,630
(You're not doing well.)

1074
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:00,860
- Jong Myung. - You keep talking about yourself.

1075
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,460
- Jong Myung. - You keep talking about yourself.

1076
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,130
- What brings you here? - Your brother came to help you.

1077
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:08,660
- What's going on? - Come here.

1078
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,360
- She's left alone for too long. - I know.

1079
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,830
- Tell her he went to the restroom. - Ji Hyo, will you join her?

1080
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,000
Shall I go downstairs?

1081
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,430
- Go downstairs. - Shall I go?

1082
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:16,790
Don't go, Kwang Soo.

1083
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:17,930
(He should stay here.)

1084
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,160
I'll go downstairs.

1085
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:23,860
You're doing well, but even your brother said this.

1086
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,660
You're talking too much about health.

1087
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,890
(He talks too much about health.)

1088
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,360
(He brings up vegetarianism out of the blue.)

1089
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,160
(He's talking too much about health.)

1090
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:36,430
This is what shocked Jong Myung the most.

1091
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:37,660
He said it's the last thing you should say.

1092
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:40,060
You told her about traveling with your mom.

1093
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,560
I told you not to say...

1094
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,930
- that you travel with Mom. - I explained to her why.

1095
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:48,360
(He talked about it for 30 minutes.)

1096
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,860
(Talking about traveling with his mom is unnecessary.)

1097
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,130
Shouldn't the conversation get deeper by now?

1098
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,760
- Right. - Here's why.

1099
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,060
It shouldn't be just a friendly conversation.

1100
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:00,860
I was telling her about my life and what kind of person I am.

1101
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,930
At this rate, you'll need two nights to finish filming it.

1102
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:06,930
Talk to her casually like she's your friend.

1103
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:08,460
Are you trying to teach me?

1104
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:10,860
(Jong Kook is quick to notice.)

1105
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,190
My goodness.

1106
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:13,830
Is he showing off because he's married?

1107
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,260
Is that why?

1108
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,160
Did Ji Hyo go down to meet her?

1109
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,960
She's trying to keep it less awkward.

1110
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,330
Did you talk a lot with him?

1111
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,960
Yes.

1112
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:26,430
Do you have questions about Jong Kook?

1113
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,330
What kind of women does he like?

1114
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:29,660
Let's see.

1115
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:32,630
Let's see.

1116
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:36,260
He doesn't like women who are too wild.

1117
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:39,560
He likes someone modest.

1118
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:45,360
He also likes someone petite.

1119
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,190
- I think you look good together. - Us?

1120
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,890
(She's embarrassed.)

1121
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:55,730
Jong Kook is a gentleman.

1122
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:58,130
I think you'll get along.

1123
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,730
As you saw, he likes to talk.

1124
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:03,160
I thought so, too.

1125
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:07,490
He's talkative, so he'll talk to you a lot.

1126
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,630
- Good luck. - Thank you.

1127
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:12,830
- Hello. - Hello.

1128
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:13,960
Why are you here?

1129
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,360
- Why are you here? - Wait.

1130
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,030
Come here.

1131
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:18,530
What are your thoughts on Jong Kook?

1132
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:20,060
What are you saying?

1133
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,190
Stop it.

1134
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:23,830
- Leave them alone. - This is important.

1135
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,630
Leave the two alone.

1136
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:28,730
- Come with me. - Will you go out if he asks?

1137
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:30,530
- Stop it. - I'm leaving.

1138
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:33,090
The conversation should get deeper.

1139
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,630
You're running out of time.

1140
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:35,990
Stop it.

1141
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:37,190
When was your last relationship?

1142
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,530
(Laughing)

1143
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,590
What did Ji Hyo say?

1144
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:43,860
What did she say to you?

1145
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,760
- Ask him. - Ask him if he likes sports.

1146
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,760
Ask him what kind of women he likes.

1147
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:50,860
- Ask him what he usually does. - Ask him about the women he likes.

1148
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,330
What did Ji Hyo say?

1149
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:54,230
(She hesitates to talk.)

1150
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:55,630
What did she say to you?

1151
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,060
She told me to ask the type of women you like.

1152
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,460
- Me? - What type of...

1153
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,730
women do you like and dislike?

1154
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:07,960
(She wants to get to know him better.)

1155
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,530
- Me? - Yes.

1156
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:16,260
I want to be with a woman who loves me.

1157
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,590
I hope she likes the way I live...

1158
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:22,960
and my perspective on life.

1159
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:25,460
Let's say I play sports.

1160
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,890
I prefer women who also play sports.

1161
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,760
If we share things in common,

1162
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,990
my girlfriend or my wife would be more positive...

1163
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:37,890
about the things I do.

1164
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:40,730
Even though he's on TV, Jong Kook is very serious.

1165
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:42,730
- Yes, he is. - I think he likes her.

1166
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:45,260
I think So Young also likes him.

1167
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,790
I'd have made an acrostic poem.

1168
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:48,230
What?

1169
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:50,760
I'd make an acrostic poem with "So Young".

1170
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,860
- "So Young"? - Yes.

1171
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,960
- "So". - I want you to be mine.

1172
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:57,560
- "Young". - Will you be with me forever?

1173
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,330
Such acrostic poem would liven up the mood.

1174
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:02,660
Seok Jin is thinking, too.

1175
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,830
- No, I'm not. - He's thinking, too.

1176
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,090
After reciting a poem,

1177
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:10,190
he can ask her to do the same with "Jong Kook".

1178
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:11,390
That's right.

1179
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:12,960
Then this is what he'll say.

1180
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,660
- Come on, Ji Hyo. "Jong". - Jong Kook.

1181
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:19,190
- "Kook". - I'll call you Kook.

1182
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:20,260
That's right.

1183
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,660
- It'll liven up the mood. - It'd be perfect.

1184
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,990
Isn't that an old tactic?

1185
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:26,060
- Say, "So Young" for me. - It isn't old.

1186
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,330
- Say, "So Young". - "So".

1187
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:31,890
So Young, I'm sorry, but you don't come first place.

1188
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:32,990
- "Young". - Zero place?

1189
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:35,660
Zero place.

1190
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,330
Don't finish my sentence.

1191
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:38,660
(Seok Jin is too predictable.)

1192
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:39,990
Can you give her a wink?

1193
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,130
This would be great.

1194
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,090
You know I'm joking, right?

1195
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,330
(It's bound to ruin any date.)

1196
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:50,660
Seok Jin, you need to make a shooting sound.

1197
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,460
(The shoot turns all women away.)

1198
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,290
He needs to lighten up the mood.

1199
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,530
He's asking about her ideal type.

1200
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,660
What type of men do you like?

1201
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,760
For me,

1202
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:04,660
there isn't an ideal type of men because my mind changes.

1203
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:06,130
Of course it changes.

1204
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:07,830
- Women change their minds often. - Right.

1205
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:11,890
Women fall for the male lead in a popular drama of the month.

1206
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,830
I've never liked celebrities.

1207
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,190
I said I'm a fan of Jae Seok.

1208
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:20,630
I haven't liked celebrities other than Jae Seok.

1209
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:23,190
That was the case for me, too.

1210
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:26,960
Since I was young, I've never liked celebrities.

1211
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,490
(They share something in common.)

1212
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:34,660
You said on TV that your ideal type is Yoon Eun Hye.

1213
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,730
(Yes, about that...)

1214
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:40,390
Where did I see it?

1215
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:41,430
(About Eun Hye)

1216
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:43,930
(He's at risk.)

1217
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:45,990
- Yoon Eun Hye? - She mentioned Yoon Eun Hye.

1218
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,890
He's close to her.

1219
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:52,890
When they were working together, an article was written about them.

1220
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:55,460
I remember hearing about it. I was in middle school.

1221
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,460
(Poor Jong Kook)

1222
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:03,330
(Yoon Eun Hye keeps coming up.)

1223
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:09,730
(He denied her feelings for Eun Hye.)

1224
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:11,790
(It was a lie.)

1225
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:16,590
(Does he still have feelings for Eun Hye?)

1226
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:21,860
(Jong Kook, please tell me the truth.)

1227
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:27,090
When people asked me which celebrity I like,

1228
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:32,460
I always said Eun Hye was the closest to being my ideal type.

1229
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:36,090
However, it's irrelevant to my romantic life.

1230
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:38,660
It's about whom I'm with.

1231
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:40,190
If you were my girlfriend,

1232
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:45,290
you would be the most beautiful person to me.

1233
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:47,930
Even if I see a beautiful female celebrity,

1234
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:48,990
I would think,

1235
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:50,990
"you're more beautiful."

1236
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:52,260
(You're the most beautiful.)

1237
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,430
(Her heart flutters.)

1238
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:58,160
(That's a great comment.)

1239
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,390
That's what I said.

1240
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:02,460
It's not just what I said. That's what I think.

1241
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:04,730
That's what I think.

1242
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:07,390
I was surprised.

1243
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:11,060
He was much different from what I had expected.

1244
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,730
To be honest, I didn't know much about him.

1245
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:17,360
I was surprised by how thoughtful he was.

1246
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:22,560
I want to get to know him better.

1247
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:27,790
(As they open up more, how will their date turn out?)

1248
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:31,530
Like mentioned before,

1249
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:35,890
So Young and Jong Kook will take the car.

1250
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,490
Please go ahead.

1251
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:39,660
Shouldn't you carry her since there are many steps?

1252
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,960
You should at least carry her.

1253
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,430
Jong Kook is trying hard not to lose his temper today.

1254
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:48,230
- I can't get angry today. - Right.

1255
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:50,160
May I make an acrostic poem with "So Young"?

1256
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,260
(An acrostic poem?)

1257
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,260
That sounds good.

1258
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,330
"So".

1259
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:58,890
So Young, I'm sorry, but you don't come first place.

1260
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:00,590
(Is it what they think it is?)

1261
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,630
It's not what I think it is, right?

1262
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:03,960
Let's just go.

1263
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,590
- No way. - Let's just go.

1264
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:07,530
I'm sorry.

1265
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:08,660
- I'm sorry. - I didn't think you knew.

1266
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:11,060
- He didn't think you knew. - I didn't know.

1267
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,530
I got scared just now.

1268
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:13,930
- I didn't think you knew. - I apologize on his behalf.

1269
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:15,230
Did you expect what came next?

1270
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:17,530
- Let's just go. - I'm sorry.

1271
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:20,130
Please go ahead first. We'll follow you.

1272
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:21,190
See you.

1273
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:22,530
See you soon.

1274
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:23,930
You're my zero place.

1275
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:25,060
Zero.

1276
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:26,990
- She doesn't even react. - I'm sorry.

1277
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:29,990
- Let's go. - She doesn't react at all.

1278
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:31,160
Let's go.

1279
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,990
(It's silent and very awkward.)

1280
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,430
Do you usually wear a lot of makeup?

1281
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:43,190
(It's his first question after thinking.)

1282
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:45,430
I'm not good at putting on makeup.

1283
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:49,160
I don't look good with heavy makeup.

1284
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,760
I asked not to put on heavy makeup for today.

1285
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:55,860
- I really hated how I looked. - Did you?

1286
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,930
But on screen... I saw you briefly on a monitor.

1287
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,460
- You looked really pretty. - Really?

1288
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:04,960
(He makes her heart flutter.)

1289
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:07,390
You have nothing to worry about.

1290
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:09,830
Some people I know,

1291
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:12,260
when they're dating someone,

1292
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:15,790
they tell the woman how to dress.

1293
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:17,860
- That happened to me. - Did it?

1294
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:21,590
I hated that so much I did the exact opposite.

1295
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:22,860
I did the exact opposite.

1296
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,760
Not exactly the opposite,

1297
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,990
- but I retaliated. - I know what you mean.

1298
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:30,590
You have a temper.

1299
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:37,860
(They've grown more comfortable with and closer to each other.)

1300
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:42,030
(Where will this path lead?)

1301
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:48,130
(The couple's evening turns to night.)

1302
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:49,330
- Let's go. - Okay.

1303
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:51,790
It feels like we're ruining their honeymoon.

1304
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:53,330
- We're following them around. - Seriously.

1305
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,790
- It's their date. - If they go on a honeymoon,

1306
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:58,190
- we won't tag along. - Where's your family from?

1307
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,630
- Yeongil. - Yeongil?

1308
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,060
Where's yours from?

1309
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,660
My family? Pretty Town.

1310
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,830
That was funny. That joke worked.

1311
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:10,890
I'm from Pretty Town.

1312
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,860
(What machine is this?)

1313
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,430
- Plush toys. - Toys.

1314
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:17,760
I love these machines.

1315
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,760
- I'm great at this. - Me, too.

1316
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:22,090
I'm an expert at this.

1317
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,330
- Let's see. - I'm awesome at this.

1318
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:26,430
There are many different toys in here.

1319
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:30,390
- What's this for? - Couples love to do this.

1320
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:33,360
- It's game over. - Let's put an end to this.

1321
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:35,060
They can meet again in private.

1322
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:36,360
- Now... - They agreed to.

1323
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:38,460
She let me call her his future wife.

1324
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,990
This is the final stage.

1325
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:44,430
The result of this mission decides whether they go on a cruise...

1326
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:47,590
(A romantic dinner on a cruise ship)

1327
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,890
Or end up in a duck boat.

1328
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:52,160
We can't ride a duck boat.

1329
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,930
We'll see Jong Kook in action.

1330
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:56,090
- Think about it. - No way.

1331
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:58,660
She's freezing cold and you want to put her in a duck boat?

1332
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,660
- It's also... - Hwan Jin.

1333
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,160
I hate you, I hate you.

1334
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,590
Why do you keep doing that?

1335
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:08,660
- You need to try it sometimes. - What for?

1336
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,530
Entertain her.

1337
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:11,760
Get ready.

1338
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:14,030
- There's 6. - You have 6 coins.

1339
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:16,830
That means you get six tries on the machine.

1340
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:18,290
Which toy should we get?

1341
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:19,960
- Anything. - Anything.

1342
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,030
Anything?

1343
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:23,130
- Yes. - It's not easy.

1344
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:25,230
Get whatever you can for the lady.

1345
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:26,860
We'll see what she wants.

1346
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,660
- Pikachu? - Whatever's easy.

1347
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:32,230
- That one, Psyduck. - No, Pikachu.

1348
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:33,590
Get this one.

1349
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,490
That one.

1350
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:38,390
Pikachu, yes.

1351
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,590
Pikachu, yes. Go for Pikachu.

1352
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:47,090
(Jae Seok said he's an expert, but how good is he really?)

1353
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:50,830
(This can't be that easy...)

1354
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:52,190
- I should play. - He got it.

1355
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:53,530
He got it.

1356
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:56,290
(The claw has Pikachu!)

1357
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:58,490
Shouldn't I be playing?

1358
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:00,660
- He won. - I'm meant to play, not you!

1359
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,630
I'm meant to play, not you!

1360
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:05,560
Jong Kook, you get five tries.

1361
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:07,590
I told you I was good.

1362
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:09,460
Have you played this before?

1363
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:11,460
- Aim for this one. - I haven't.

1364
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:12,460
It's random.

1365
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:13,990
Good luck.

1366
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:15,930
- Good luck. - Go for this one.

1367
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:18,260
I'll see if I can get this one.

1368
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:19,860
Try getting that Pikachu.

1369
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,490
Be quiet.

1370
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:23,830
- You be quiet. - Go for it.

1371
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:28,460
(I'll go straight for it.)

1372
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:32,530
(This last stage of the date depends on this machine.)

1373
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:39,790
(Will it be a romance like "Titanic" or torture like "12 Years a Slave"?)

1374
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,160
(Cautious)

1375
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,590
- Hey, hey! - I didn't press it yet.

1376
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,960
(The claw dives straight down.)

1377
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,390
- I didn't press the button! - You went overtime.

1378
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,730
Is there a time limit?

1379
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:54,890
You can't take your time with this.

1380
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:57,030
I asked how many shots I got.

1381
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:59,390
- Don't just go to the gym. - Watch what you're doing.

1382
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:01,930
You have to be careful.

1383
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:03,230
Watch the time limit.

1384
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:04,230
(They might all take the duck boat.)

1385
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,430
I'm telling you, that tiger will work.

1386
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:09,390
I'm telling you, that tiger will work.

1387
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,060
Perfect.

1388
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,090
- A bit more. - It's fine.

1389
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:14,530
It looks okay.

1390
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,030
(The claw descends.)

1391
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:18,660
Press the button.

1392
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,090
It's working.

1393
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:22,130
(The claw grabs it.)

1394
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:24,860
(Two failures are unacceptable.)

1395
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:26,390
It's not a good hold.

1396
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:32,830
(Come with me, little ducky.)

1397
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:36,930
That was close.

1398
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:41,330
(The claw didn't have a strong enough hold.)

1399
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:43,060
Why did you...

1400
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:45,390
You should've let him do it.

1401
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,160
You have three more tries.

1402
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:50,030
- Take us on a cruise ship. - How about this one?

1403
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:51,760
This one might be easy to get.

1404
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:54,030
- I prefer this one. - Get the tiger.

1405
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:56,230
Get out of the way, Mister!

1406
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:59,290
- You wasted a chance. - You're bad luck!

1407
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:01,990
I'm good at this.

1408
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,430
- So what? - Did it move?

1409
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:06,290
- Good. - Good.

1410
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,990
You might get this one.

1411
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:10,130
No, no, those two...

1412
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,630
(The toy slips once again.)

1413
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:13,660
That one?

1414
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,160
- There's one on top. - Get the head.

1415
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,360
Try to grab its head.

1416
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,330
Listen to me. Get the tiger.

1417
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:19,660
Shut your mouth.

1418
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:22,160
- His dark side's coming out. - It is.

1419
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,990
You're showing your true colors.

1420
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,190
It's about time.

1421
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:26,590
It's time to keep quiet.

1422
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:28,260
Be very careful.

1423
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,790
Which tiger?

1424
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,560
- The tiger. - The tiger.

1425
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,890
No, get this duck's head.

1426
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:35,090
The head.

1427
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:36,560
- The duck? - It's easier now.

1428
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,260
- The last shot. - The last shot.

1429
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:41,090
- Don't go for the tiger. - You're taking his side now.

1430
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,660
The tiger's too deep in the pile.

1431
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:47,760
She doesn't want to ride the duck boat, either.

1432
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:52,190
- The duck... - I think he'll get it.

1433
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,860
This is why you keep spending. You rarely win anything.

1434
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:03,660
(Ducky, will you really not come with me?)

1435
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:06,660
This is why you keep spending. You rarely win anything.

1436
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:10,160
It's a lost cause.

1437
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:14,960
(The duck ascends.)

1438
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:20,590
(The ugly duckling takes flight.)

1439
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:25,360
(Jong Kook aimed for a tiny duck.)

1440
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:32,460
(He who never gives up will ride a cruise ship.)

1441
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:38,130
(It's a fail.)

1442
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:39,890
Why did you drop that?

1443
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,430
I told you to get the tiger.

1444
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:42,930
I said tiger.

1445
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,960
Let's just all pile into a duck boat.

1446
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,290
- What now? - Oh no...

1447
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:48,860
Go for this one now.

1448
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,260
- I have one more shot. - It's your last one.

1449
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,930
- This is it. - Get the tiger.

1450
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:54,390
It's perfectly located.

1451
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:56,090
- It's not. - Go for...

1452
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:58,990
Go for the bottom half of it.

1453
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:01,960
I have to get the tag on that one.

1454
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,890
I don't think you can get it.

1455
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:06,890
So Young said she doesn't think I can get the tiger.

1456
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:09,060
- Try for this one. - I think the tiger's your best bet.

1457
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:11,930
- Get the tiger. - It's either the tiger or Snorlax.

1458
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:13,360
The tiger looks okay.

1459
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,490
- The tiger? - It might work.

1460
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:17,660
(They place their final bet on the tiger.)

1461
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:23,560
(This one last game decides how the date will end.)

1462
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:25,330
- I'll go for the tiger. - Okay.

1463
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,730
- Can't I have one more shot? - Go a bit further.

1464
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,190
A bit to the side.

1465
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:32,230
- I think you'll get it. - Now?

1466
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:35,230
- Grab its bottom. - Come a bit this way.

1467
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:37,030
- No, this is good. - Leave it there.

1468
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:39,290
- You got it. - This is it.

1469
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:43,830
- I told you so. - You got it.

1470
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:49,530
(The die has been cast.)

1471
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:56,560
(Please take the lift, Tiger.)

1472
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,760
Look.

1473
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,030
You got it.

1474
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:00,060
(The claw has it.)

1475
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:08,060
(They're halfway there. Hang in there, Tiger!)

1476
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:18,630
(They're saved!)

1477
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:22,190
(He got the tiger on his last try.)

1478
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:23,760
You did it!

1479
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,390
(I told you so!)

1480
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:26,430
See?

1481
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,590
Well done.

1482
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:32,330
Did you see that? I'm an expert.

1483
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:35,090
The tiger got the tiger.

1484
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,390
(They recognized each other.)

1485
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:38,530
- It's for you. - What a lovely picture.

1486
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:40,260
- That was close. - They held hands.

1487
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:42,590
That was so close.

1488
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:44,660
- This game... - And so...

1489
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,130
they got married and lived...

1490
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:47,930
They got married and lived...

1491
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:49,230
(How embarrassing.)

1492
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:50,890
I told you not to say things like that.

1493
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:53,830
It was the tiger after all.

1494
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:55,160
Did you see that?

1495
01:00:55,330 --> 01:00:57,760
- He picked himself. - It was our last coin.

1496
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,260
As promised,

1497
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:02,390
you two get to go on the cruise ship.

1498
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:05,330
- What a relief. - I'm so glad.

1499
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:06,660
That was so close.

1500
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:07,730
Let's go.

1501
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,960
(The couple board the cruise ship wondering what's in store.)

1502
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,090
Why did they decorate the place with a heart?

1503
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:24,830
(Sweet desserts await the couple.)

1504
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:28,460
I'm so sorry about this.

1505
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,890
- Romance is good, but it's so cold. - It's okay.

1506
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,930
- This wasn't my idea. - Okay.

1507
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:37,990
It wasn't my idea.

1508
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:41,430
It's freezing. You said your feet are cold.

1509
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:43,530
This is terrible.

1510
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:45,590
Use this, too.

1511
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:47,860
- I'm fine. - Please, I don't need it.

1512
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:49,160
- I'm fine. - Okay.

1513
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:51,530
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

1514
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:55,360
(Isn't he so sweet?)

1515
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:59,230
I've never seen him this happy.

1516
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:01,130
That's a real smile.

1517
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:03,660
He's open to dating right now.

1518
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:06,390
I've known Jong Kook for a long time...

1519
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:08,830
- and I think he likes her. - He does.

1520
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:11,560
- That's for certain. - He wants to ask her out.

1521
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:14,030
He doesn't like how it's not going in that direction.

1522
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:18,160
(The cruise ship is full of love.)

1523
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:22,560
I never knew Yeouido was this pretty.

1524
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:25,660
- I really like the Han River. - Is that so?

1525
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,490
- I go a lot in the summer. - To the Han River?

1526
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:30,030
It's been a while since I've been on the cruise ship though.

1527
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:33,360
I see. People living in Seoul don't go on it.

1528
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:35,730
(They've been here a lot but it feels different today.)

1529
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,060
It's darker now...

1530
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,790
- so the woman opens up as well. - It turns romantic.

1531
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,330
- Should we leave? - Sure.

1532
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:47,490
- We don't have anything to do. - I'm getting jealous.

1533
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,590
Why are you getting jealous?

1534
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:51,560
- What are you talking about? - I'm getting jealous.

1535
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,760
That was the weirdest thing you said today.

1536
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:57,090
- I don't think so. - Why are you getting jealous?

1537
01:02:57,090 --> 01:02:58,390
(He wants to be the sweetest person here.)

1538
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:01,830
(This guy is about to change that.)

1539
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:03,960
- You like sweets, right? - Yes.

1540
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:06,260
- It looks good. - It looks good.

1541
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:07,730
(It's dessert time aboard the cruise.)

1542
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:10,830
I have to put it on the side.

1543
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,360
(Swaying)

1544
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,930
(It spills.)

1545
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:16,830
Oh, dear.

1546
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,560
(What's wrong with my hand?)

1547
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,730
Hold on.

1548
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:22,830
He did that on purpose.

1549
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:25,460
- I knew it. That's so old. - That's crafty.

1550
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:28,960
- He has such old style. My gosh. - My gosh.

1551
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,660
In movies, they spill things on purpose...

1552
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:33,960
and give the woman a change of clothes.

1553
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,630
You offer to wash their clothes, make them change...

1554
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:38,160
Never mind.

1555
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:40,460
(Never mind.)

1556
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:43,960
- You must be old, too. - No way.

1557
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:46,430
- Have some cake. - Sure.

1558
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:49,030
Do you have a favorite song?

1559
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:50,130
"One Man"?

1560
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:54,130
(One Man)

1561
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:58,660
They're both old style.

1562
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:01,290
- I can't listen to this anymore. - They're a good match.

1563
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:04,230
- I can't believe So Young... - They know we're watching.

1564
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:06,830
- said that. - Don't be mean.

1565
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:09,160
We can't stand this.

1566
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:12,290
People might change channels so put on the music video of "TT".

1567
01:04:13,390 --> 01:04:15,760
- Did anybody tell you to say this? - No.

1568
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,830
That's the only song I remembered.

1569
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:20,560
It could be a different singer.

1570
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:23,330
- "Last Love". - "Lost Love"?

1571
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:25,360
(She picks "Last Love".)

1572
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,360
Did anyone tell her to say this?

1573
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:29,360
Why do you ask?

1574
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:32,890
I sing this song once in a while.

1575
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:35,590
- Nobody told me that. - Really?

1576
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:37,790
- No. - Is it really your favorite song?

1577
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:39,290
(This old style couple has a mutual understanding.)

1578
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:41,990
Should I sing it now?

1579
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:44,290
- I can sing. - Sure.

1580
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,660
(I'd love to hear it.)

1581
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:48,930
This is driving me nuts. I don't know what I'm doing.

1582
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:49,930
(He stands up reluctantly.)

1583
01:04:49,930 --> 01:04:52,230
I'm sorry. I think I need to sing...

1584
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:55,860
for us to move on to the next topic.

1585
01:04:56,230 --> 01:05:00,330
In this situation, Jong Kook and men in general...

1586
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:02,460
need something...

1587
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,760
- to score big points. - Right.

1588
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,460
He has to try his best.

1589
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:10,730
I was lucky to have met you

1590
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:12,360
I was lucky.

1591
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,930
(This is the song older men used to score points with ladies.)

1592
01:05:14,930 --> 01:05:15,960
That's it.

1593
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,160
(Hard-standing charms)

1594
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,530
This is where you pull the woman's heartstrings.

1595
01:05:19,830 --> 01:05:22,360
The scenery is nice...

1596
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,630
so I think it'll be nice to hear him sing.

1597
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:29,460
("Last Love" by Kim Jong Kook)

1598
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,260
This is driving me nuts.

1599
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,460
Let me start.

1600
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:36,430
(It's a cruise concert just for one woman.)

1601
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:40,830
Thanks for being here today.

1602
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:42,960
(They only met for a short time...)

1603
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:50,230
(but he wants to thank her for being here.)

1604
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:53,930
My heart.

1605
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,560
(Rumbling)

1606
01:05:56,660 --> 01:06:00,930
(Rumbling)

1607
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:05,060
- It's the wind. - What's that?

1608
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:06,560
It's the subway.

1609
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:09,260
- Is that a ship? - No, it's the subway.

1610
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:15,190
(The noise makes the song sound more melodic.)

1611
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:21,730
(Why does it have to be now?)

1612
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:25,360
(We didn't want it to be awkward so we got the subway.)

1613
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:27,760
The subway is in the scenery.

1614
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,390
She looks happy.

1615
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:31,960
- It's jealous. - She's smiling a lot.

1616
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,160
I hope they get pooped on by pigeons.

1617
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:41,130
There's a train passing.

1618
01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:42,960
(My goodness!)

1619
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,230
My gosh.

1620
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:46,090
How could this happen?

1621
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:48,460
(The subway's always there to lighten up the atmosphere.)

1622
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:49,560
It's incredible.

1623
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,790
(The subway's always there to lighten up the atmosphere.)

1624
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:55,860
(The real "Last Love" by Kim Jong Kook)

1625
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:59,560
(It's for the woman...)

1626
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:02,660
(who spent the day with him...)

1627
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:07,960
(despite the cold weather.)

1628
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,490
(His voice rings all over Yeouido.)

1629
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:11,660
So Young...

1630
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:13,790
was looking at him.

1631
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:15,560
- Then she must have turned shy. - She must have.

1632
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,360
She turned away. You know when they do this?

1633
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:27,090
Don't say anything.

1634
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:29,930
(His calming face melts away all your worries.)

1635
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:33,460
It's like he's on "Inkigayo".

1636
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:36,360
- I mean... - He's trying his best.

1637
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:37,760
(He's trying so hard.)

1638
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:41,460
He has his arm folded like this. It's like he's on "Inkigayo".

1639
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:43,360
(It's a ballad by one man...)

1640
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:47,160
(who's trying desperately to save his blind date.)

1641
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:52,190
Even if you did wrong just like me.

1642
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:56,290
(It's a concert just for one person...)

1643
01:07:56,290 --> 01:08:00,460
(aboard the cruise ship.)

1644
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:02,660
They say.

1645
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:04,990
- Love doesn't last forever - This looks nice.

1646
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:07,660
It'll look great when it's edited a little bit.

1647
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:09,490
Are you jealous?

1648
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:10,730
(You're not jealous, right?)

1649
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:12,660
This is what he wants to do.

1650
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,160
All men...

1651
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,390
- want to be main leads in a drama. - That's right.

1652
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:20,660
Seok Jin will star as "Nose Goblin".

1653
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:23,660
- "Nose Goblin"? - He has a cotton in his nose.

1654
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,230
He dies when the bride takes it out for him.

1655
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:28,660
He gets a nose bleed and dies.

1656
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:30,930
(Nose Goblin)

1657
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:33,230
They say.

1658
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:38,160
(The song reaches the climax...)

1659
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:43,460
(as the day comes to an end.)

1660
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:47,760
- You - You.

1661
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:51,890
- Only you - Only you.

1662
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:55,460
(They get immersed too much.)

1663
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:57,490
(My last love)

1664
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:59,300
You.

1665
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:06,130
(He sings with his heart and soul.)

1666
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:09,660
My last love.

1667
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,390
From now on.

1668
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:18,360
One thing can't change.

1669
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:19,730
You are my only true love.

1670
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:24,490
(The sweet lyrics make the song even better.)

1671
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:29,300
(Thank you for making a special memory for me.)

1672
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:32,890
I know I can't do this but that made my heart flutter.

1673
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:34,830
It's quite romantic.

1674
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:35,930
He's going to say something now.

1675
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:40,460
I don't.

1676
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:41,960
(Gazing)

1677
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:45,060
Think I can.

1678
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:48,730
- What's wrong with his eyes? - Love again.

1679
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:50,960
- Aren't those the snake's eyes? - Snake's eyes?

1680
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:51,960
(He's gazing on purpose.)

1681
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,190
- Aren't those the snake's eyes? - It must be.

1682
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:59,560
(The emotions run deep until the end.)

1683
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:04,300
(That was a successful concert.)

1684
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:07,860
- Was it okay? - Yes, you were great.

1685
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:10,660
I wish it was a better atmosphere.

1686
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:13,030
- I got 100 points. - Gosh.

1687
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:15,060
(He must have tried extra hard.)

1688
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:17,030
(Excellent job!)

1689
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:19,030
- He got the perfect score. - Did he?

1690
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:20,300
That's incredible.

1691
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,460
- The machine is on his side. - "And now, I..."

1692
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:25,060
What if So Young starts singing Wax's "Honey"?

1693
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:26,060
(The next stage is by So Young.)

1694
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,730
Look at me only.

1695
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:28,860
What about "Tears" by So Chan Whee?

1696
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:30,030
(Another recommendation is "Tears" by So Chan Whee.)

1697
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:33,260
Don't call me a merciless woman.

1698
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:35,130
- And she'll start headbanging. - Gosh.

1699
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:37,860
I'm starting to wish that things don't work out between them.

1700
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:39,430
- I agree. - Me, too.

1701
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:41,730
I want it to end funny.

1702
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:45,330
(The dreamy cruise ship date ends.)

1703
01:10:45,330 --> 01:10:46,360
Use this.

1704
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:47,460
(They're gathered.)

1705
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:50,130
- Good. - It's been a while.

1706
01:10:50,130 --> 01:10:53,390
(They light up 5 firecrackers for Jong Kook and So Young.)

1707
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:55,360
They're coming.

1708
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,360
(Welcome to land.)

1709
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:00,490
What are you doing?

1710
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:02,490
- She's shy. - We're wishing you luck.

1711
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:04,230
(Thanks for the performance.)

1712
01:11:04,230 --> 01:11:06,830
- Thanks for the performance. - My last love.

1713
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:09,160
- You saw it? - You even sang the second verse.

1714
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:11,160
- Did you see the subway pass by? - Congratulations.

1715
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,800
(It was a humorous serenade thanks to the subway.)

1716
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:15,730
- It's decision time. - That's right.

1717
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:18,260
Jong Kook, I'll ask you...

1718
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:20,960
to get back on the cruise ship.

1719
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,930
So Young will give us a call.

1720
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:29,460
If she's willing to go on another date with you,

1721
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:33,360
we'll put heart stickers on your name tag.

1722
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,590
If she had a good time...

1723
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:38,490
but felt uncomfortable...

1724
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:40,360
or if she needs to reconsider...

1725
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:42,300
If that's the case,

1726
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:44,960
we'll rip your name tag.

1727
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,730
(If So Young says no, they'll rip his name tag.)

1728
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,460
- Don't worry. - Do you feel uncomfortable?

1729
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:51,760
I see those dolls got closer already.

1730
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:52,760
Well...

1731
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:54,890
- Gosh. - You will miss each other.

1732
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:57,260
The way they're gazing at each other is very passionate.

1733
01:11:57,890 --> 01:11:59,890
It all worked out well.

1734
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:02,800
Stop it. Stay out of it.

1735
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,300
(They are already celebrating.)

1736
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:05,890
This will affect my decision-making.

1737
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:06,960
It will?

1738
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,830
- It will affect her decision. - Don't you worry.

1739
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:13,590
(It's hard to figure out her decision. What will it be?)

1740
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:16,930
(So Young, let us know what you've decided.)

1741
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:21,660
(Jong Kook, who will wait for her decision, moves inside the cruise.)

1742
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,330
My goodness. Everyone's watching.

1743
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:29,390
She will come here to either put a heart on it or remove my name tag.

1744
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:34,860
I thought since it's a TV show, she might feel uncomfortable.

1745
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:37,630
I thought I should accept it well even if she rejects me...

1746
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,930
when she had a great time today.

1747
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:42,890
I tried my best to be calm and to expect the least.

1748
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:48,430
No one knows what will happen to us...

1749
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:50,360
but I hope we can have a good relationship.

1750
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:55,130
- Poor Jong Kook. - We must put a heart or...

1751
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:58,190
- She's calling. - She's calling.

1752
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:00,760
Hello?

1753
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:02,560
Hello?

1754
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,630
- Hi, So Young. - Hi.

1755
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:06,360
Have you decided?

1756
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,160
Yes, I have.

1757
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:12,760
He told me a lot of things.

1758
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:15,660
He wasn't like what I had in mind.

1759
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:18,360
In fact, I didn't know much about him.

1760
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,490
(I saw a new side to him today.)

1761
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:23,890
I bet you gave it a lot of thought.

1762
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,800
So what is your decision?

1763
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:28,430
I decided...

1764
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:34,660
(What will her last answer be?)

1765
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:38,160
You took care of me a lot today.

1766
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:43,930
(On this freezing day, he reached out for her hand.)

1767
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:48,160
(He put her name tag on for her.)

1768
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:52,490
(He gave her a stuffed animal which he tried his best to win.)

1769
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:57,300
(He sincerely sang a song for her.)

1770
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:01,830
Thank you for giving me a great time today.

1771
01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:04,130
I will see you again.

1772
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,760
(She made her decision.)

1773
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,530
I understand.

1774
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:11,860
(What does she mean by it?)

1775
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:13,490
That's your decision, right?

1776
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:16,130
(It's hard to figure out through Jae Seok's facial expression.)

1777
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:21,190
(A man awaits for her decision.)

1778
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:23,590
It was good. It was fun.

1779
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:25,090
(After contemplating, she made her decision.)

1780
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:26,300
It was nice.

1781
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:28,190
(After contemplating, she made her decision.)

1782
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,360
Hurry.

1783
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:32,530
(Members visit Jong Kook after the call.)

1784
01:14:32,530 --> 01:14:33,800
I can't help but smile.

1785
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:35,760
(It's hard to read their faces.)

1786
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:36,860
Who will tell him?

1787
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:39,430
- We really... - Yes?

1788
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,030
This sure is funny.

1789
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:43,830
It's only a variety show.

1790
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:44,990
(Is he hinting something?)

1791
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:47,530
- Really. - By the way...

1792
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:49,730
- It doesn't matter what happens. - It's a variety show.

1793
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:53,630
You expressed your feelings about her throughout the day.

1794
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:55,490
This can be a good relationship.

1795
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:58,090
We can get to know each other.

1796
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:00,260
No one knows what will happen.

1797
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:02,590
- You're interested in seeing her? - Yes, I am.

1798
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:05,190
You don't have to meet on a TV show.

1799
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:07,190
She might just not be comfortable on television.

1800
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:09,030
- That's possible. - You're right.

1801
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:10,990
(Did being on the show make her feel uncomfortable?)

1802
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:13,260
You don't have to meet on TV.

1803
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:15,030
(He does something suspicious.)

1804
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:16,030
She might feel pressured.

1805
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:17,590
(Ripping)

1806
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,560
(Jae Seok removes his name tag.)

1807
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:24,630
(Hold on, this means...)

1808
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:29,660
(From the beginning, the members made her feel pressured.)

1809
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:31,590
(What are you doing?)

1810
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:35,760
(Throughout the day, their dramatic differences were revealed.)

1811
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:37,660
Get her to talk!

1812
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,630
(Their conversation was one-sided.)

1813
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:41,260
(Spilling)

1814
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:45,490
(He spilled a cold beverage on the cruise.)

1815
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:48,830
(Did all these things make her reject me?)

1816
01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:50,490
Why don't you put the heart on it?

1817
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:53,330
(He's puzzled.)

1818
01:15:53,330 --> 01:15:54,430
What's going on?

1819
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:56,190
Congratulations.

1820
01:15:56,190 --> 01:15:58,560
(It was a joke. She chose you.)

1821
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:02,190
- Why is it so windy? - Hey.

1822
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:03,630
What was that?

1823
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:06,090
(So Young said yes and chose Jong Kook.)

1824
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:07,300
It's all blown away.

1825
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:08,960
(It looks like they're all chosen.)

1826
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:12,160
I was convincing myself I will be okay if she rejected me.

1827
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:15,590
What we did today crossed my mind.

1828
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:17,630
- She's coming. - Thank you.

1829
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:21,390
(Here comes the bride of Jong Kook.)

1830
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:22,630
I should give you this, right?

1831
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:24,730
Thank you.

1832
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:25,860
It's cold.

1833
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:27,590
It turned out well.

1834
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:29,190
- It's a happy ending. - First of all,

1835
01:16:29,190 --> 01:16:33,430
we shouldn't get ahead of you two.

1836
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:38,590
This was your first time meeting. Keep in touch.

1837
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:43,330
You should meet up some other time and get to know each other.

1838
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:45,360
You will have to figure out on your own.

1839
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,030
- Of course. - This is where we stop.

1840
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:49,460
- Congratulations. - We hope your relationship lasts.

1841
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:53,590
(His blind date was a success even though he's not getting married.)

1842
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:56,360
It's Running Man's Member's week.

1843
01:16:58,430 --> 01:16:59,960
(The 3rd participant)

1844
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:05,030
(Who will be next?)
