1
00:00:06,045 --> 00:00:07,945
(Hongye Park, Chungcheong Province)

2
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:10,415
- Hello. - Hello.

3
00:00:10,415 --> 00:00:11,945
(It's a beautiful spring day.)

4
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,285
Look at the sun. The weather is fantastic.

5
00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:15,945
It's a sunny day in Chungcheong Province.

6
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:17,085
(Welcome to South Chungcheong Province.)

7
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:19,015
- We're at Chungcheong Province. - I love Chungcheong Province!

8
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:21,485
- It's been a while since we came. - It feels great to be here.

9
00:00:21,485 --> 00:00:23,485
- This is great. - I'm so excited.

10
00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:25,415
Today, Ji Hyo isn't here with us.

11
00:00:25,415 --> 00:00:28,615
- You're right. - I feel like we're going to be...

12
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:30,815
- doing a couple game today. - I think so too.

13
00:00:30,815 --> 00:00:33,285
- My heart is fluttering. - We might pair up with actors.

14
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:35,515
- I can see some vans over there. - It's been a while.

15
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:38,285
We haven't done this in a while, so we should give it a go.

16
00:00:38,285 --> 00:00:40,645
- I wonder who's here. - It's the popular Choi Tae Joon.

17
00:00:40,645 --> 00:00:43,285
- Oh, it's Tae Joon! - Tae Joon is here!

18
00:00:43,285 --> 00:00:44,785
(It's prince charming, Choi Tae Joon.)

19
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,445
(We invited the hottest actor to balance out the gender ratio.)

20
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:49,945
- It's nice to see you. - Hi.

21
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:51,915
- How have you been? - It's good to see you.

22
00:00:51,915 --> 00:00:54,845
- Hey. - Tae Joon came on the show...

23
00:00:54,845 --> 00:00:57,615
a couple years ago as a guest. How long ago was it?

24
00:00:57,615 --> 00:01:00,215
- It was around two years ago. - That's right.

25
00:01:00,215 --> 00:01:01,915
- It was cold back then too. - There were other male guests.

26
00:01:01,915 --> 00:01:04,215
- He got eliminated really quickly. - Yes, I did.

27
00:01:04,215 --> 00:01:05,615
(The sad memory comes back.)

28
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:11,085
(He appeared on the show as a passionate rookie guest.)

29
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:17,285
(But sadly, he got eliminated as soon as the game started.)

30
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:20,315
I heard that we're going to be doing a couple game today.

31
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:22,015
I really want to pair up with Ji Hyo.

32
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,415
- I see. - That's really great.

33
00:01:24,415 --> 00:01:26,685
- Thanks. - I wish you all the best.

34
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:29,115
- Thank you. - If he pairs up with Ji Hyo...

35
00:01:29,115 --> 00:01:31,285
It's okay. Ji Hyo's a pretty good player.

36
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:33,845
Let me tell you guys a little bit about Tae Joon.

37
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:35,915
- He's great at imitating people. - Really?

38
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:38,315
- Try imitating Lee Sun Gyun. - People refrain from imitating...

39
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:42,185
Sun Gyun outside because the wind makes it hard for us to hear them.

40
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,085
It's hard, but let's give it a go.

41
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:48,915
"Hey, Joon Hyuk. You're not the only doctor here. I'm a doctor too."

42
00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:51,685
"Hey, Joon Hyuk. You're not the only doctor here. I'm a doctor too."

43
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:54,315
- He's good. - He sounds similar, right?

44
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:56,015
- That was great. - He sounds exactly like him.

45
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,485
(Glancing)

46
00:01:57,915 --> 00:02:00,915
Excuse me, but can you stop looking over there when we're all...

47
00:02:00,915 --> 00:02:03,115
- trying to focus on Tae Joon? - I just can't wait.

48
00:02:03,115 --> 00:02:05,385
- What's wrong with you? - I'm curious of who's left to come.

49
00:02:05,385 --> 00:02:07,945
- My goodness. - Ji Hyo will be Tae Joon's partner.

50
00:02:07,945 --> 00:02:11,215
Let me introduce our other guests who will be joining us today.

51
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,785
- Come on out. - Who are you?

52
00:02:13,845 --> 00:02:15,115
(She's the princess of Running Man, Song Ji Hyo.)

53
00:02:15,115 --> 00:02:16,415
Hey, get rid of that frown.

54
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:18,745
(Dancing while frowning)

55
00:02:18,745 --> 00:02:22,115
- Did the cold make you go mad? - It's seriously so cold today.

56
00:02:22,115 --> 00:02:24,485
- I thought she was Um Hong Gil. - It's really cold, isn't it?

57
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:27,285
- Are you... - I thought you were Um Hong Gil.

58
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,915
Ji Hyo, you look like a top celebrity today.

59
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:32,115
(Why is Um Hong Gil here instead of our princess, Ji Hyo?)

60
00:02:32,115 --> 00:02:33,715
- She looks... - Stop it, you guys.

61
00:02:33,715 --> 00:02:36,315
- Stop it. - I'm really serious.

62
00:02:36,315 --> 00:02:38,315
- Ji Hyo. - I'm not joking right now.

63
00:02:38,315 --> 00:02:40,445
- No, I'm just... - Tae Joon, she's not your partner.

64
00:02:40,445 --> 00:02:42,685
- Hello. - Come over here.

65
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:45,215
- She's not your partner yet. - No, come over here.

66
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:46,685
- He's not your partner yet. - Why?

67
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:49,715
- I told you he's not your partner. - Let me work with someone new too.

68
00:02:49,915 --> 00:02:52,615
- Move aside, Jae Seok. - Ji Hyo. Come here.

69
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:54,515
- Ji Hyo. - She's forceful as always.

70
00:02:54,785 --> 00:02:57,685
Why don't we bring in the next guest? Please come on out.

71
00:02:58,185 --> 00:02:59,315
Come on out.

72
00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:01,545
(Who is the real princess they've been waiting for?)

73
00:03:02,385 --> 00:03:04,015
It's Jeon So Min.

74
00:03:04,845 --> 00:03:06,815
(Jeon So Min, Princess Aurora)

75
00:03:07,215 --> 00:03:08,615
- Nice to see you, So Min. - Hello.

76
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:11,085
- I haven't seen you for ages. - Have you been well?

77
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:13,185
- She was Kwang Soo's partner. - Beer, beer!

78
00:03:13,185 --> 00:03:15,985
- She was paired up with him. - She became so pretty.

79
00:03:15,985 --> 00:03:17,115
(She was Kwang Soo's partner.)

80
00:03:17,715 --> 00:03:23,015
(So Min desperately asked for beer in the morning 3 years ago.)

81
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:29,715
(They performed well as the crazy couple with her unique charms.)

82
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:32,845
- Did you two work well together? - We did.

83
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,315
- Was she your love interest? - No.

84
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:36,485
It was the first time I didn't have a love interest in a couple race.

85
00:03:37,215 --> 00:03:40,115
It hurts my feelings. Perhaps, you don't like me.

86
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:41,315
No, we are just colleagues.

87
00:03:42,315 --> 00:03:44,545
So Min. What are you up to these days?

88
00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:48,245
I'm not doing anything.

89
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:49,515
Is that so?

90
00:03:49,785 --> 00:03:52,415
- So Min... - Are you just drinking beer?

91
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:55,645
- She's straightforward and blunt. - It's nice.

92
00:03:55,645 --> 00:03:58,785
Which brings me to say this. To all the directors in Korea,

93
00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:02,015
I'd like to say I am worth your money.

94
00:04:02,045 --> 00:04:04,685
(I am Jeon So Min, the cost-effective actor.)

95
00:04:04,915 --> 00:04:05,985
(It's a culture shock.)

96
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:08,545
- Stop it, So Min. - Please cast me.

97
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:10,315
- Please stop it. - I will work hard.

98
00:04:10,315 --> 00:04:12,185
- Work hard on our program. - What's wrong with you?

99
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:13,715
So Min.

100
00:04:13,715 --> 00:04:16,415
- You're the talk of the town. - Why?

101
00:04:16,415 --> 00:04:17,815
What she did was...

102
00:04:17,815 --> 00:04:20,645
she made a choreography and named it herself.

103
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:21,785
What is the choreography?

104
00:04:21,785 --> 00:04:23,015
It's called Old Lady Dance.

105
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:25,285
She uploaded a video of this dance.

106
00:04:25,285 --> 00:04:28,445
You garnered a lot of attention from many viewers, right?

107
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:30,785
- I wouldn't say a lot though. - I don't know what it is.

108
00:04:30,785 --> 00:04:32,085
(It's all very new to them.)

109
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:34,645
- I've never heard of it. - I keep up with the news.

110
00:04:34,645 --> 00:04:36,285
- We can watch her dance. - Go home if you will be mean.

111
00:04:36,715 --> 00:04:38,945
- Go home if you plan to misbehave. - Have you seen it?

112
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,085
No. I haven't!

113
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:42,085
I'm going to see it now!

114
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:43,685
(So shut it!)

115
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:48,285
This is the Old Lady Dance which will be the talk of the town soon.

116
00:04:48,285 --> 00:04:51,045
- Can you show us the dance? - Isn't it so sudden? Now?

117
00:04:51,045 --> 00:04:52,815
- Yes, please show us now. - In 1, 2.

118
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:54,645
- In 1, 2, 3, 4. - In 1, 2, 3, 4.

119
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:56,115
(She reveals the dance without any music.)

120
00:04:56,615 --> 00:04:58,145
(Cute)

121
00:04:58,645 --> 00:04:59,685
So Min.

122
00:05:00,285 --> 00:05:01,545
(She dances hard.)

123
00:05:01,545 --> 00:05:03,015
I don't think viewers will like this.

124
00:05:04,485 --> 00:05:06,355
- She became crazier. - So Min.

125
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:09,185
How can you say she's crazier? Please watch your tongue.

126
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:10,685
I mean she became more unique.

127
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:14,115
All right. We will bring in the third guest now.

128
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:16,355
- It's very cold today. - Come on out.

129
00:05:16,355 --> 00:05:18,115
(Isn't this "Ah-Choo" by Lovelyz?)

130
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,545
It's Lee Se Young!

131
00:05:20,615 --> 00:05:23,645
She's Lee Se Young.

132
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:26,445
(Welcome. It's Se Young of Ah-Choo Couple!)

133
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:28,645
She's Lee Se Young of Ah-Choo Couple.

134
00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:31,715
(She played a role of Princess Cheongseon in a historical drama.)

135
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:33,515
- She turned into a lady. - It's been ages.

136
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:38,615
She got popular while being a cute couple with Hyun Woo in a drama.

137
00:05:38,615 --> 00:05:40,645
- "Ah-Choo" was their theme song. - There was a song about the couple.

138
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:43,445
- I'm happy to have you join us. - She starred on the drama.

139
00:05:43,445 --> 00:05:46,145
- Who is feeling cold the most? - Who is it?

140
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,785
- Someone's in a short sleeve shirt. - It's Kang Han Na.

141
00:05:48,785 --> 00:05:51,015
(She's wearing a short sleeve shirt in this cold weather?)

142
00:05:51,345 --> 00:05:54,045
(Stop talking and get on with the show.)

143
00:05:54,385 --> 00:05:56,785
Then I should call her in right away. Hold on.

144
00:05:56,785 --> 00:05:58,015
- Come on out. - Let's see who she is.

145
00:05:58,015 --> 00:05:59,845
- How can she wear that? - It's so cold to wear that.

146
00:05:59,845 --> 00:06:01,415
(While everyone was chatting,)

147
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:03,885
(she was freezing. Who is this princess?)

148
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:05,715
- She's not in a short sleeve shirt. - That's not a short sleeve shirt.

149
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:07,815
- She's wearing it inside. - I see.

150
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:09,215
It's Kang Han Na.

151
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:14,715
(She played the role of a mean princess on a drama last year.)

152
00:06:15,545 --> 00:06:18,445
(She's wearing a summer outfit.)

153
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:19,845
Goodness, she's pretty.

154
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:21,585
She is beautiful in person.

155
00:06:21,585 --> 00:06:23,715
(She is the prettiest in the world.)

156
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:25,815
It is a see-through jacket.

157
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:27,545
- There's nothing underneath. - Aren't you too cold?

158
00:06:27,545 --> 00:06:29,385
When my stylist gave me this, she said it was a spring jacket.

159
00:06:30,315 --> 00:06:34,145
You might not know, but she used to do ballet.

160
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:35,885
- Really? - That explains.

161
00:06:36,045 --> 00:06:38,645
- Isn't that true? - It is.

162
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:40,445
I learned it for about 9 or 10 years.

163
00:06:40,445 --> 00:06:42,085
- You learned it for 9 years? - Goodness.

164
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:45,315
In 1, 2...

165
00:06:45,315 --> 00:06:48,385
She can't start dancing like this. You're not cultured enough.

166
00:06:48,385 --> 00:06:50,685
- You don't know anything. - He's really unsophisticated.

167
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:53,185
- You know nothing about culture. - "Culture"?

168
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:54,715
(He's too uneducated.)

169
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:56,815
- I'll make this short. - Sure.

170
00:06:57,015 --> 00:06:58,785
It's nothing to brag about.

171
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,115
You did it for 9 years.

172
00:07:00,115 --> 00:07:01,985
(Her feet position looks professional.)

173
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:04,845
- Amazing. - How did she do that?

174
00:07:04,885 --> 00:07:06,415
- Are your feet okay? - Yes, they are fine.

175
00:07:07,045 --> 00:07:08,885
I should hurry. Hold on.

176
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:10,445
You seem to talk to yourself a lot.

177
00:07:11,545 --> 00:07:13,345
- It's hard to do it without music. - It could've been over by now.

178
00:07:13,815 --> 00:07:15,615
- I'll hurry. - Okay.

179
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:17,715
(She starts in a rush.)

180
00:07:19,545 --> 00:07:23,785
(She moves like an elegant and graceful bird.)

181
00:07:23,785 --> 00:07:26,215
- Her posture is great. - It looks like she's experienced.

182
00:07:26,215 --> 00:07:27,215
But she's a bit stiff.

183
00:07:27,215 --> 00:07:29,245
(He criticizes her.)

184
00:07:29,945 --> 00:07:32,345
(She goes back to her spot in a hurry.)

185
00:07:32,645 --> 00:07:35,715
- Why did you say that? - I'm sorry.

186
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:37,615
I thought you two were a couple.

187
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:40,385
- Are you two vets? - What's going on?

188
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:43,485
- Do you work at the animal shelter? - You two look like vets.

189
00:07:43,485 --> 00:07:46,145
- You know nothing about culture. - It's a culture shock indeed.

190
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:48,785
- He knows nothing about the arts. - It's a culture shock for me.

191
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:51,285
- Let's bring in the next guest. - She's the last guest, right?

192
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:52,285
(It's time to meet the fifth princess.)

193
00:07:53,445 --> 00:07:56,685
(The foul-mouthed princess from a film "Sunny" has come.)

194
00:07:57,315 --> 00:08:01,785
- It's Park Jin Joo. - Hey, Jin Joo.

195
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:03,715
Swear at us. Please!

196
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:06,045
Jin Joo is joining us today.

197
00:08:06,215 --> 00:08:07,345
(She's an expert in acting.)

198
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:09,085
- It's nice to meet you. - This is nice.

199
00:08:10,385 --> 00:08:14,445
- Her outfit is suitable for today. - Yes. I feel happy about it.

200
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:15,585
- You are? - Yes.

201
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:17,515
She starred on a film "Sunny". You all watched it, right?

202
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:19,785
- She was amazing. - Her character was foul-mouthed.

203
00:08:19,885 --> 00:08:21,985
- Her role left an impression on us. - She was great.

204
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:25,315
First of all, please swear at us.

205
00:08:25,315 --> 00:08:27,645
(He requests her to swear at him although they just met.)

206
00:08:28,545 --> 00:08:30,415
- Swear at Jae Seok. - Yes, please.

207
00:08:30,415 --> 00:08:31,585
- Are you okay with this? - Yes.

208
00:08:31,585 --> 00:08:33,915
- We just met. - That's all right.

209
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:35,245
- I'll try then. - Okay.

210
00:08:36,915 --> 00:08:38,885
Hey, you. Which bakery...

211
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,185
are you from, you loaf of bread.

212
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:44,485
(Bread turns into a swearing word instantly.)

213
00:08:44,715 --> 00:08:45,845
I got it.

214
00:08:46,915 --> 00:08:49,845
(He's about to lose his mind.)

215
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:51,115
She said, "You loaf of bread."

216
00:08:51,145 --> 00:08:52,545
(Thank you for your witty swearing.)

217
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:55,915
She's amazing. I also heard she sings well.

218
00:08:55,915 --> 00:08:59,345
Can you sing us a song?

219
00:08:59,345 --> 00:09:01,955
- I will sing "Onara". - She'll sing "Onara".

220
00:09:02,415 --> 00:09:03,985
It's a great weather for the song.

221
00:09:03,985 --> 00:09:07,145
This song is suitable for a day like this.

222
00:09:07,145 --> 00:09:08,455
Please sing us the song.

223
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,715
Come here

224
00:09:11,715 --> 00:09:14,545
Are you coming?

225
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:19,715
- She's really amazing. - Are you going for good?

226
00:09:19,845 --> 00:09:22,385
(She sings the best she can.)

227
00:09:22,385 --> 00:09:25,015
- Han Na. Do the ballet now. - I'll stop here.

228
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,955
(Stopping)

229
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:29,985
She was about to do it.

230
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:31,085
- Han Na. - I wasn't going to.

231
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:32,545
- You went like this. - It can be a song for ballet.

232
00:09:32,545 --> 00:09:34,785
They could have had a joint performance.

233
00:09:34,785 --> 00:09:36,455
Wait. Can you dance like that too?

234
00:09:36,485 --> 00:09:39,185
- You can also do popping dance. - I thought you did ballet.

235
00:09:39,185 --> 00:09:40,515
You can do this.

236
00:09:40,515 --> 00:09:43,145
- How disappointing. - I wanted to see it.

237
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:44,385
This was Jin Joo.

238
00:09:44,385 --> 00:09:45,715
(Welcome, Jin Joo.)

239
00:09:45,715 --> 00:09:47,415
The last guest remains.

240
00:09:47,415 --> 00:09:50,415
- She must have waited for long. - There's another guest?

241
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:51,785
Please come on out.

242
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:54,285
It's Um Ji.

243
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:56,545
(Um Ji of Gfriend, the hottest idol group, visits.)

244
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:58,545
- She's dancing. - She's in Gfriend.

245
00:09:58,545 --> 00:10:01,215
(I will steal Running Man members' hearts.)

246
00:10:01,915 --> 00:10:03,315
She doesn't look startled at all.

247
00:10:03,315 --> 00:10:07,315
(This cute choreography will melt the cold wave.)

248
00:10:08,115 --> 00:10:10,715
(Um Ji of Gfriend)

249
00:10:12,315 --> 00:10:14,715
- Um Ji of Gfriend is joining us. - Hey, Um Ji.

250
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,545
(Um Ji has returned with a new song.)

251
00:10:16,545 --> 00:10:19,385
Everyone is a princess. Um Ji is a princess by her name.

252
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,545
- She's Thumbelina. - She is.

253
00:10:22,545 --> 00:10:25,085
We have six guests joining us today.

254
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:27,515
(We'd like to welcome 6 princesses and 1 prince.)

255
00:10:27,515 --> 00:10:30,815
We need to choose our partner.

256
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:31,915
How will we choose our partner?

257
00:10:31,915 --> 00:10:34,815
The mission that will determine your partner is called "My Lovely Face".

258
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:38,545
The female members will draw...

259
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:40,715
your own self-portrait for 10 seconds.

260
00:10:41,545 --> 00:10:42,645
The male members will look...

261
00:10:42,645 --> 00:10:44,545
- at the portraits. - We'll choose a portrait?

262
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:46,515
- You can pick a portrait you like. - We have to pick.

263
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:47,955
- I see. - This is nice.

264
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:49,645
- You have 10 seconds. - I'm sorry,

265
00:10:49,645 --> 00:10:51,785
but couldn't you include your outfit in the portrait?

266
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,845
- Draw a hat if you're wearing one. - Draw your hat.

267
00:10:53,845 --> 00:10:55,485
You can draw however you want.

268
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,345
(They are ready.)

269
00:10:59,045 --> 00:11:02,045
I'm nervous. Why am I nervous for this?

270
00:11:02,145 --> 00:11:03,185
Get ready.

271
00:11:03,185 --> 00:11:04,685
(Today's partner depends on this self-portrait.)

272
00:11:04,685 --> 00:11:06,645
10 seconds are way too short.

273
00:11:06,845 --> 00:11:08,385
Can we draw it in 10 seconds?

274
00:11:08,385 --> 00:11:09,715
Set.

275
00:11:09,715 --> 00:11:12,545
(The mission starts.)

276
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:15,115
(They are serious.)

277
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:18,185
- Draw your hat! - Seven.

278
00:11:18,185 --> 00:11:20,885
(Princess Ji Hyo, please draw your hat for Tae Joon.)

279
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:23,415
(Can someone shut him up?)

280
00:11:24,315 --> 00:11:27,585
(I will put my soul into this portrait.)

281
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,045
- Two. - Your hat!

282
00:11:29,115 --> 00:11:31,685
(They draw until the last second.)

283
00:11:33,515 --> 00:11:34,715
Time is up.

284
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:37,185
(How will their portraits look?)

285
00:11:38,345 --> 00:11:41,285
- Where's the hat? - How will we know with these?

286
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:42,785
Do we have someone that looks like this portrait?

287
00:11:43,915 --> 00:11:46,885
(Did someone who looks like this join us today?)

288
00:11:47,385 --> 00:11:49,145
Who drew this flower?

289
00:11:50,715 --> 00:11:52,345
Isn't this Hong Gil?

290
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,115
- This is... - I want Ji Hyo as my partner.

291
00:11:54,115 --> 00:11:55,715
- This is Ji Hyo's. - Really?

292
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,045
- This has to be hers. - No, that is not Ji Hyo's portrait.

293
00:11:58,045 --> 00:12:00,885
- I think this is Jin Joo's. - I see. It looks like Jin Joo's.

294
00:12:00,885 --> 00:12:03,285
- This has to be Ji Hyo's. - She can't draw like this.

295
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:04,715
- No one looks like this. - I'm certain this is Ji Hyo's.

296
00:12:04,715 --> 00:12:06,045
(Tae Joon chooses the drawing of flower.)

297
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:08,345
- I will choose this flower. - That has to be Ji Hyo's portrait.

298
00:12:08,345 --> 00:12:09,685
- Who drew this? - This is...

299
00:12:10,385 --> 00:12:11,845
Wait. You grabbed one.

300
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:13,715
- Once you grab it, it's done. - You chose that.

301
00:12:13,715 --> 00:12:15,085
Hold on to it.

302
00:12:15,445 --> 00:12:17,015
- I'll choose this one. - Are you certain?

303
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:19,545
- I have a good feeling about this. - Hurry.

304
00:12:19,545 --> 00:12:22,145
(They are done choosing the portraits.)

305
00:12:22,145 --> 00:12:23,815
Do you want to switch? This is your last chance.

306
00:12:23,815 --> 00:12:24,885
(They are excited.)

307
00:12:24,885 --> 00:12:26,015
I won't switch.

308
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:31,145
(Current status of the selection of the portraits)

309
00:12:31,245 --> 00:12:33,015
Haha, step forward.

310
00:12:33,445 --> 00:12:35,185
- Reveal it when I count to three. - It's a really nice drawing.

311
00:12:35,185 --> 00:12:37,345
- In 1, 2, 3. - It looks like Jin Joo.

312
00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:42,885
(It's a round, cute face. Is it Jin Joo's portrait like Seok Jin said?)

313
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:44,445
Everyone can guess this is Jin Joo's portrait.

314
00:12:44,445 --> 00:12:47,345
(It's Jin Joo.)

315
00:12:47,715 --> 00:12:49,315
It really is Jin Joo.

316
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:51,585
- I wanted her. - We'll survive.

317
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,285
Next up is Kwang Soo.

318
00:12:53,285 --> 00:12:54,545
I can't wait to find out.

319
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:56,045
- Who is it? - I think I know.

320
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:57,645
- I'm curious. - This is so fun.

321
00:12:57,645 --> 00:12:58,645
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

322
00:12:58,645 --> 00:12:59,715
Who is it?

323
00:12:59,715 --> 00:13:01,015
(Whose drawing is it?)

324
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:03,045
In 1, 2, 3.

325
00:13:03,585 --> 00:13:07,815
(Who is Kwang Soo's princess?)

326
00:13:07,815 --> 00:13:09,045
Is it So Min again?

327
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:10,885
(It's her again.)

328
00:13:11,615 --> 00:13:12,685
(She cries in sorrow.)

329
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:15,185
- What's wrong? - That's so mean.

330
00:13:15,315 --> 00:13:16,415
What's wrong, So Min?

331
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:18,785
You don't know how charming I am.

332
00:13:18,785 --> 00:13:20,415
Listen, So Min.

333
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:22,015
Aren't you happy you're partners again?

334
00:13:22,015 --> 00:13:23,515
- What's wrong? - Nothing.

335
00:13:23,515 --> 00:13:25,715
With whom do you want to be partners?

336
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:27,715
I wanted Han Na too.

337
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:29,215
(He wanted someone else.)

338
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:32,845
(The worst couple is forced to get back together.)

339
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,845
That's hilarious.

340
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:36,785
We have no choice.

341
00:13:36,785 --> 00:13:37,885
It's good.

342
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:40,285
I look forward to this couple today.

343
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:42,715
- You look good together. - They don't like each other.

344
00:13:42,785 --> 00:13:46,085
All women tense up as Seok Jin steps forward.

345
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:47,115
(Everyone is tense.)

346
00:13:47,115 --> 00:13:48,915
This isn't the final round.

347
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:49,915
(Each one has a 25-percent chance.)

348
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:51,115
Just wait.

349
00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:53,785
It's 1 of the 4. Just wait.

350
00:13:53,785 --> 00:13:55,185
Who will it be?

351
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:56,545
In 1, 2, 3.

352
00:13:56,715 --> 00:13:57,815
Let's see.

353
00:13:57,815 --> 00:13:59,385
- It's this. - Whose is it?

354
00:13:59,515 --> 00:14:01,645
In 1, 2, 3.

355
00:14:01,645 --> 00:14:02,945
(Their eyes quiver.)

356
00:14:04,115 --> 00:14:05,545
(They hesitate and get flustered.)

357
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:08,145
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 2, 3.

358
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:09,585
(She walks forward slowly.)

359
00:14:09,585 --> 00:14:12,015
- You startled me. - It's Han Na.

360
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,585
Their outfits match.

361
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:14,985
Our outfits?

362
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:16,785
(They have matching jackets.)

363
00:14:17,485 --> 00:14:18,715
She looks so unhappy.

364
00:14:19,615 --> 00:14:21,885
She denied that it was her drawing at first.

365
00:14:21,885 --> 00:14:23,845
She hesitated at first.

366
00:14:23,845 --> 00:14:26,345
Han Na looked at me right now.

367
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:28,845
Wasn't she asking Ji Hyo to step forward instead?

368
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:30,845
(She asks Ji Hyo for help.)

369
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:32,515
By the way...

370
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:35,245
- They look uncomfortable. - It sparkles.

371
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:36,645
Next is Jong Kook.

372
00:14:36,645 --> 00:14:38,915
(Who will be Jong Kook's partner?)

373
00:14:39,515 --> 00:14:40,815
I'm in trouble.

374
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:42,145
(His heart starts to beat fast.)

375
00:14:42,145 --> 00:14:43,785
- No way. - In 2, 3.

376
00:14:43,885 --> 00:14:45,015
Is it her in the middle?

377
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:48,085
That's right.

378
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:52,785
(Who drew a face with a big smile?)

379
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,215
Three.

380
00:14:56,215 --> 00:15:00,215
(Jong Kook and Se Young become a couple.)

381
00:15:00,215 --> 00:15:02,545
They're like an uncle and his niece.

382
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:04,815
I was so startled.

383
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:06,485
- This is great. - Right now,

384
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:10,015
many of you aren't happy with your partners.

385
00:15:10,015 --> 00:15:12,445
It's very obvious who drew this.

386
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,815
- Why do you say that out loud? - Isn't it Um Ji?

387
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,115
Isn't it Um Ji?

388
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,985
Isn't it obvious?

389
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:19,785
Tae Joon recognized Ji Hyo's.

390
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,715
- He was right. - That's good.

391
00:15:21,715 --> 00:15:23,485
- I hope I'm right. - Let's see.

392
00:15:23,485 --> 00:15:25,945
(A man waits for her while holding a flower.)

393
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:27,785
Ji Hyo?

394
00:15:27,785 --> 00:15:29,915
(Is this your flower, Ji Hyo?)

395
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:31,585
- I hope I'm right. - Let's see.

396
00:15:32,815 --> 00:15:34,285
(Ji Hyo's flower blooms.)

397
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:35,485
Um Ji.

398
00:15:35,945 --> 00:15:37,045
You're prettier than this flower.

399
00:15:37,615 --> 00:15:39,415
Thank you. You're the best.

400
00:15:39,415 --> 00:15:41,415
I heard it's Couple Race today.

401
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:43,585
I came here because I wanted to be your partner.

402
00:15:43,585 --> 00:15:44,585
(He meets his princess.)

403
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:50,185
(The members are divided into couples.)

404
00:15:50,185 --> 00:15:52,045
You're divided into couples.

405
00:15:52,045 --> 00:15:55,085
Today's mission is Cheapskate Couple Race.

406
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:56,145
(Cheapskate Couple Race)

407
00:15:56,145 --> 00:15:58,185
- This is great. - Cheapskate Couple Race?

408
00:15:58,285 --> 00:16:01,715
The couple with the most money left...

409
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:04,185
will be the final winner.

410
00:16:04,545 --> 00:16:07,285
Each female member will pick an envelope.

411
00:16:07,285 --> 00:16:10,015
There's an amount from 10 to 60 dollars...

412
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:11,145
in each envelope.

413
00:16:11,615 --> 00:16:13,115
- 60 dollars? - Really?

414
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:15,915
There's an amount from 10 to 40 dollars...

415
00:16:15,915 --> 00:16:17,815
in the male members' bags.

416
00:16:17,815 --> 00:16:19,085
- Also, - How much?

417
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:20,115
the envelope's amount times two.

418
00:16:20,115 --> 00:16:23,345
(It's twice as much as what the woman has.)

419
00:16:23,985 --> 00:16:26,085
It could divide the amount by two.

420
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,115
(It's half of what the woman has.)

421
00:16:27,115 --> 00:16:29,785
- Divide what the woman has by two? - Right.

422
00:16:29,785 --> 00:16:32,315
If you divide 10 dollars in half, it's 5 dollars.

423
00:16:32,845 --> 00:16:35,385
- I'm very frugal. - Really?

424
00:16:35,785 --> 00:16:37,715
Did you hear what Um Ji said?

425
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:39,245
"I'm very frugal."

426
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:40,345
(Don't worry, Jae Seok.)

427
00:16:41,245 --> 00:16:42,785
It means she's confident.

428
00:16:42,845 --> 00:16:44,645
Jin Joo.

429
00:16:44,645 --> 00:16:46,315
You're popular these days.

430
00:16:46,315 --> 00:16:48,085
- Hurry and pick one. - Trust your instinct.

431
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:49,845
- Jin Joo? - She picked that one.

432
00:16:49,845 --> 00:16:51,345
(Each woman picks an envelope.)

433
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:52,415
Okay.

434
00:16:52,415 --> 00:16:54,245
- Which one do you want? - This one.

435
00:16:55,045 --> 00:16:56,145
(So Min picks 60 dollars.)

436
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:57,715
- Let's eat delicious food. - Don't make it obvious.

437
00:16:57,715 --> 00:16:58,815
Don't make it obvious.

438
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,485
(Han Na picks 50 dollars.)

439
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:02,685
Is there anything else?

440
00:17:02,685 --> 00:17:04,715
(Se Young picks 40 dollars.)

441
00:17:05,715 --> 00:17:07,315
(Jin Joo picks 30 dollars.)

442
00:17:07,315 --> 00:17:08,345
That's good.

443
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:10,585
- This is enough, Ji Hyo. - It's okay.

444
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:12,215
(Um Ji picks the least amount.)

445
00:17:12,215 --> 00:17:13,445
Let's not tell them.

446
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:17,685
- Okay. - Okay.

447
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:19,085
- Let's go. - This is more important.

448
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:20,445
(Men's choice will determine their fate.)

449
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:22,815
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

450
00:17:22,815 --> 00:17:24,345
- Let's go. - I pick this.

451
00:17:24,345 --> 00:17:25,785
I pick this one.

452
00:17:25,785 --> 00:17:26,845
(They choose randomly.)

453
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:30,245
Why would we play rock-paper-scissors?

454
00:17:30,245 --> 00:17:32,415
- Let's pick again. - Come here.

455
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,585
I pick this one.

456
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,685
- You can't do that. - I didn't look inside.

457
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:38,115
Is this good?

458
00:17:38,115 --> 00:17:39,545
We should play rock-paper-scissors.

459
00:17:39,545 --> 00:17:41,285
Why should we?

460
00:17:41,285 --> 00:17:42,885
- Why? - We should.

461
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:44,985
- Why? - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

462
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:46,545
(Such reaction only means one thing.)

463
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:49,045
(He picked dividing by two.)

464
00:17:49,045 --> 00:17:51,385
- Did you pick division? - Why don't we play it?

465
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:52,845
You picked division.

466
00:17:52,845 --> 00:17:54,815
(He becomes poor in an instant.)

467
00:17:54,915 --> 00:17:57,545
Let's start our first round.

468
00:17:57,545 --> 00:17:59,085
- Let's go. - Let's go.

469
00:17:59,085 --> 00:18:00,315
(Which couple will make the most out of it?)

470
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:01,415
Let's go.

471
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:02,885
Here we go.

472
00:18:04,655 --> 00:18:08,415
(These are current amounts each couple has.)

473
00:18:08,715 --> 00:18:10,285
- Let's eat delicious food. - Seriously.

474
00:18:10,285 --> 00:18:12,015
Let's eat something delicious.

475
00:18:12,015 --> 00:18:13,315
What's going on here?

476
00:18:13,315 --> 00:18:14,615
It looks like a karaoke machine.

477
00:18:15,155 --> 00:18:18,285
Jin Joo would be the best.

478
00:18:18,285 --> 00:18:20,715
- Jin Joo? - This is the first round.

479
00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:22,485
It's "Couple Karaoke".

480
00:18:22,485 --> 00:18:25,245
("Couple Karaoke")

481
00:18:25,245 --> 00:18:28,685
The winner will be determined by your singing scores.

482
00:18:28,685 --> 00:18:29,885
There are bonus scores.

483
00:18:30,185 --> 00:18:33,385
Choose 1 of 6 money sacks.

484
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:34,815
While you sing,

485
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:38,155
count the amount of money in the sack.

486
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:40,245
- While singing? - Yes.

487
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:42,085
If you count the amount accurately,

488
00:18:42,085 --> 00:18:45,545
you get 50 additional points to your singing score.

489
00:18:45,545 --> 00:18:47,155
- 50? - That's a lot.

490
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:48,485
Do we get the money?

491
00:18:48,685 --> 00:18:50,445
No, you have to return it.

492
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:52,185
Don't you have enough money?

493
00:18:52,185 --> 00:18:53,515
- Us? - Do you need more?

494
00:18:53,515 --> 00:18:54,945
No, we have enough.

495
00:18:54,945 --> 00:18:56,345
(He doesn't admit it.)

496
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:57,345
We have enough.

497
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,655
- I feel rich as I'm with Jong Kook. - Of course.

498
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:03,515
Even if we live in a small studio,

499
00:19:03,515 --> 00:19:05,485
- we can be happy. - That's nonsense.

500
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:07,815
Stop joking around.

501
00:19:08,085 --> 00:19:09,185
Be careful.

502
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,155
- I'm happy. - Stop joking.

503
00:19:11,155 --> 00:19:14,345
Let's start "Couple Karaoke" right away.

504
00:19:14,345 --> 00:19:15,345
(The mission starts.)

505
00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:16,445
May I drink water?

506
00:19:16,445 --> 00:19:17,655
- There are shrimp chips. - Yes, you may.

507
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:18,915
Can we eat shrimp chips?

508
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:20,715
We need a high score.

509
00:19:20,715 --> 00:19:21,715
- Han Na. - Yes?

510
00:19:21,715 --> 00:19:22,985
Which song do you sing?

511
00:19:24,715 --> 00:19:26,815
(They plan to make it exciting.)

512
00:19:27,815 --> 00:19:29,385
Let's determine the order.

513
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:31,185
Are we playing rock-paper-scissors again?

514
00:19:31,185 --> 00:19:32,815
No, we're tired of that.

515
00:19:32,815 --> 00:19:34,845
- Han Na suggested flipping hands. - No, I didn't.

516
00:19:35,345 --> 00:19:37,615
Han Na suggested we play flipping hands.

517
00:19:37,615 --> 00:19:39,915
- I think she used to play a lot. - Flipping hands?

518
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:41,615
She mentioned flipping hands.

519
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:42,985
Do you know what flipping hands is?

520
00:19:42,985 --> 00:19:44,245
Isn't it face up or down?

521
00:19:44,245 --> 00:19:45,415
Face up or down?

522
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:47,045
We call it flipping hands in my neighborhood.

523
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:48,515
What about you, Jin Joo?

524
00:19:48,515 --> 00:19:49,785
- It's called sseulmano. - What?

525
00:19:49,785 --> 00:19:51,415
- Sseulmano. - What's that?

526
00:19:51,445 --> 00:19:54,685
Sseulmano, whatever you want, put your hand out

527
00:19:54,785 --> 00:19:56,915
- What? - Did you make that up?

528
00:19:56,915 --> 00:19:58,655
- What was that? - Did you make it up?

529
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,715
Did you live in Japan?

530
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:01,885
Usually it goes, "Face up or down".

531
00:20:02,045 --> 00:20:03,715
- Flipping hands - Flipping hands

532
00:20:03,715 --> 00:20:04,945
Are all of you from Seoul?

533
00:20:04,945 --> 00:20:06,685
Can you say it again, Jin Joo?

534
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:09,685
Sseulmano, whatever you want, put your hand out

535
00:20:10,115 --> 00:20:11,245
"Put your hand out"?

536
00:20:11,245 --> 00:20:12,515
It sounds Russian.

537
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:14,345
- This is how I played it. - How about you, Tae Joon?

538
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:16,315
- Flipping hands - How about you, Ji Hyo?

539
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,545
Me too.

540
00:20:17,545 --> 00:20:18,585
What about you, Jong Kook?

541
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:19,685
- It was up to me. - Flipping hands

542
00:20:19,915 --> 00:20:21,485
- What do you mean? - I divided the teams.

543
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:22,845
You did?

544
00:20:22,845 --> 00:20:25,485
"You're on this team, you're on that team."

545
00:20:25,585 --> 00:20:26,685
(She's impressed.)

546
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:30,045
I bet that was so much fun.

547
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:31,485
(He was the boss.)

548
00:20:31,485 --> 00:20:33,685
- That's cruel. - He's the best.

549
00:20:33,685 --> 00:20:34,685
How about you, Kwang Soo?

550
00:20:34,945 --> 00:20:36,155
Flipping hands and hands

551
00:20:36,155 --> 00:20:37,785
(Hands and hands?)

552
00:20:37,785 --> 00:20:40,245
(The extra word is the key.)

553
00:20:40,245 --> 00:20:41,585
- No way. - I'm being serious.

554
00:20:41,585 --> 00:20:43,615
- Stop it. - Kwang Soo.

555
00:20:43,615 --> 00:20:45,515
- Stop lying. - Go away.

556
00:20:45,515 --> 00:20:47,715
- Go away, Kwang Soo. - Ask my friends.

557
00:20:47,785 --> 00:20:50,655
- "Flipping hands and hands"? - That sounds strange.

558
00:20:50,655 --> 00:20:51,985
I'm not lying.

559
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:53,985
(Running Man respects every culture.)

560
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:55,515
Anyone can make it up.

561
00:20:55,715 --> 00:20:57,415
Face up's and down's

562
00:20:57,415 --> 00:20:58,985
(How about this one?)

563
00:20:58,985 --> 00:21:01,615
(Do you like the dance with it?)

564
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:03,885
- What are you doing? - You can make it.

565
00:21:03,885 --> 00:21:05,715
You can make it easily.

566
00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:07,215
Face up's and down's

567
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:08,245
(He can come up with 100.)

568
00:21:08,245 --> 00:21:10,585
(They determine the order by drawing lots.)

569
00:21:11,385 --> 00:21:14,885
(Tae Joon and Ji Hyo go first.)

570
00:21:15,215 --> 00:21:17,345
We'll sing "Hawaiian Couple".

571
00:21:17,345 --> 00:21:19,945
- That's a good song. - Does the song go like this?

572
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,685
- It's a cute song. - It's "Hawaiian Couple".

573
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,655
- I love this song. - It's a great song.

574
00:21:24,655 --> 00:21:26,215
I like it.

575
00:21:26,215 --> 00:21:29,045
Was the title "Hawaiian Couple"?

576
00:21:29,415 --> 00:21:31,315
- It's a good song. - Aloha.

577
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:33,085
- Aloha. - Aloha.

578
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:34,615
- Mahalo. - Mahalo.

579
00:21:34,655 --> 00:21:36,245
(He starts dancing.)

580
00:21:37,815 --> 00:21:39,585
(You're cute)

581
00:21:39,585 --> 00:21:41,345
You're cute when you smile

582
00:21:41,545 --> 00:21:44,715
(You're so cute, my lover)

583
00:21:45,285 --> 00:21:47,085
(You're handsome)

584
00:21:47,085 --> 00:21:50,415
(The song is very sweet.)

585
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:53,015
(Se Young gets into a trance.)

586
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,585
(Every joint in her body dances.)

587
00:21:57,815 --> 00:21:59,585
Show us your powerful dance.

588
00:21:59,915 --> 00:22:01,215
(Show us your dance.)

589
00:22:02,485 --> 00:22:05,485
(The idol singer's dance is different.)

590
00:22:06,215 --> 00:22:07,245
Come on, Han Na.

591
00:22:07,615 --> 00:22:09,545
(Han Na starts to dance.)

592
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:11,315
(She swings her legs.)

593
00:22:11,545 --> 00:22:12,715
(She moves her feet.)

594
00:22:12,715 --> 00:22:13,815
Good job.

595
00:22:13,815 --> 00:22:15,245
(She dances like a pretty man.)

596
00:22:15,245 --> 00:22:16,645
Look at her.

597
00:22:17,685 --> 00:22:19,245
(She dances like a robot.)

598
00:22:19,415 --> 00:22:22,285
(So Min shows how to do popping.)

599
00:22:22,415 --> 00:22:25,245
(She shows off her talent and can't control her excitement.)

600
00:22:25,315 --> 00:22:26,385
Next is Jin Joo.

601
00:22:26,385 --> 00:22:29,245
(She dances like a b-boy.)

602
00:22:30,445 --> 00:22:33,385
(She keeps it cool until the end.)

603
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,945
Come on, Um Ji. You can do it too.

604
00:22:35,945 --> 00:22:37,585
(Is this a dance competition?)

605
00:22:37,585 --> 00:22:41,085
(She swings her arms like a windmill.)

606
00:22:41,315 --> 00:22:43,015
You can do it, Han Na.

607
00:22:43,015 --> 00:22:44,315
That's right.

608
00:22:44,345 --> 00:22:46,485
- Go. - Let's go.

609
00:22:46,485 --> 00:22:48,485
- Here comes Jin Joo. - Go.

610
00:22:48,485 --> 00:22:51,045
(I'm the best dancer here.)

611
00:22:51,545 --> 00:22:53,585
- Jin Joo! - Go!

612
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:56,115
(It's a mess.)

613
00:22:56,485 --> 00:22:57,915
Get out of my way!

614
00:22:57,915 --> 00:22:59,245
(Get out of my way!)

615
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:00,885
(Ji Hyo and Tae Joon finally get the money sack.)

616
00:23:00,885 --> 00:23:02,015
Hey!

617
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,115
That was great.

618
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:06,845
- Great job! - Do it again later.

619
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:09,115
Just dance, everyone.

620
00:23:09,115 --> 00:23:10,245
(They have to count the money accurately.)

621
00:23:11,945 --> 00:23:13,045
(My performance is not over yet.)

622
00:23:13,045 --> 00:23:15,115
- That's amazing. - Um Ji, dance with her.

623
00:23:15,115 --> 00:23:16,945
Do the wave.

624
00:23:16,945 --> 00:23:18,785
(The princesses wave together.)

625
00:23:18,785 --> 00:23:20,585
(Roll it...)

626
00:23:20,585 --> 00:23:21,885
(and toss it.)

627
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:23,015
(Bouncing)

628
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:26,045
(The old man is here again.)

629
00:23:26,085 --> 00:23:27,545
Great job, Um Ji.

630
00:23:27,585 --> 00:23:29,685
(While the team is counting the money...)

631
00:23:29,685 --> 00:23:31,545
(and singing,)

632
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:33,645
(the dance competition goes on.)

633
00:23:34,115 --> 00:23:35,685
- You're doing great! - What's that?

634
00:23:35,685 --> 00:23:37,115
(She sacrifices her bottom.)

635
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:40,085
(Her joints are not cooperating.)

636
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,785
- What's that? - Nice!

637
00:23:42,785 --> 00:23:44,285
(Stiff)

638
00:23:45,145 --> 00:23:48,185
(It looks more like gymnastics.)

639
00:23:48,185 --> 00:23:49,585
You're so cute and sexy.

640
00:23:50,985 --> 00:23:52,585
(The dance battle comes to an end.)

641
00:23:52,585 --> 00:23:54,415
Distract them!

642
00:23:54,415 --> 00:23:59,115
(They're losing concentration.)

643
00:24:00,015 --> 00:24:02,285
- It's almost over. - Six, eight...

644
00:24:02,285 --> 00:24:04,145
- They should follow the rules. - 10, 12...

645
00:24:04,145 --> 00:24:06,045
- You dropped some. - 12...

646
00:24:07,185 --> 00:24:08,685
(What is this?)

647
00:24:08,685 --> 00:24:10,115
Good job.

648
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,015
It's over now.

649
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:14,285
I thought it was "Gayo Stage".

650
00:24:14,285 --> 00:24:17,045
- It was like a night club. - Ji Hyo, Tae Joon.

651
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:20,115
- Thank you. - We had so much fun.

652
00:24:20,115 --> 00:24:22,385
We had a lot of fun.

653
00:24:22,385 --> 00:24:24,285
I didn't expect this song to excite us so much.

654
00:24:24,685 --> 00:24:27,485
- I didn't expect it either. - I didn't know.

655
00:24:27,485 --> 00:24:29,545
(Their score is 83.)

656
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:33,045
- Tell us. - 53 dollars and 34 cents.

657
00:24:34,085 --> 00:24:35,845
- Wrong. - All right.

658
00:24:35,845 --> 00:24:38,545
- How much was it? - It was 58 dollars and 74 cents.

659
00:24:38,785 --> 00:24:40,785
You were right about the four cents.

660
00:24:40,785 --> 00:24:42,985
We didn't distract you so much.

661
00:24:42,985 --> 00:24:44,685
- We didn't? - We didn't.

662
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:46,645
I'm looking forward to Haha's team's performance.

663
00:24:46,645 --> 00:24:48,885
- It's not that. - Let's go.

664
00:24:49,215 --> 00:24:51,715
- It's "I Cheated". - They look great together.

665
00:24:51,715 --> 00:24:53,945
- They're both great singers. - They look good together.

666
00:24:53,945 --> 00:24:56,385
- Pick up your microphone. - Jin Joo is an amazing singer.

667
00:24:56,385 --> 00:24:58,185
- Jin Joo is a great singer. - She is.

668
00:24:58,185 --> 00:25:00,945
(Many are looking forward to their performance.)

669
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:04,385
(Can you really handle our performance?)

670
00:25:04,385 --> 00:25:06,715
(Are you ready to have fun?)

671
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:10,415
(Here we go.)

672
00:25:10,415 --> 00:25:11,885
(Let's go.)

673
00:25:12,715 --> 00:25:14,915
(Here comes rapper Haha.)

674
00:25:14,915 --> 00:25:17,545
(He's owning the stage.)

675
00:25:18,815 --> 00:25:22,115
(I'm on fire)

676
00:25:22,115 --> 00:25:23,415
(Burning with passion)

677
00:25:23,415 --> 00:25:24,685
(The atmosphere heats up)

678
00:25:24,685 --> 00:25:27,045
(We're on fire right now)

679
00:25:28,185 --> 00:25:30,245
(Look at us.)

680
00:25:30,245 --> 00:25:33,045
(This is teamwork.)

681
00:25:34,485 --> 00:25:36,545
(We're the real scene stealers.)

682
00:25:36,545 --> 00:25:39,415
- We didn't plan this. - Did you practice?

683
00:25:39,415 --> 00:25:40,915
(They show off their teamwork.)

684
00:25:42,145 --> 00:25:44,115
- I'm sorry, Mom - Mom

685
00:25:44,315 --> 00:25:47,785
(The money sack is handed over.)

686
00:25:47,785 --> 00:25:50,545
(Will they be good at multitasking?)

687
00:25:50,545 --> 00:25:52,285
(We're a bit busy)

688
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:54,415
(We're not sure if we have time to count the money.)

689
00:25:54,415 --> 00:25:56,285
(Laughing)

690
00:25:56,285 --> 00:25:58,115
We can't stop laughing

691
00:25:58,115 --> 00:26:00,085
- We have to do this. - I'm on fire

692
00:26:00,415 --> 00:26:03,315
(They're making an X-sign with their bodies.)

693
00:26:03,315 --> 00:26:05,945
- They don't miss anything. - That was so random.

694
00:26:05,945 --> 00:26:07,845
I'm on fire

695
00:26:07,845 --> 00:26:08,845
(It might go viral.)

696
00:26:08,845 --> 00:26:11,445
How can you have such great teamwork?

697
00:26:12,845 --> 00:26:13,845
(Here comes the climax.)

698
00:26:13,845 --> 00:26:15,415
- Here we go. - Go.

699
00:26:15,715 --> 00:26:19,545
(It's Saturday night)

700
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:23,485
(Let's have some fun)

701
00:26:23,485 --> 00:26:26,215
(She has an amazing voice.)

702
00:26:26,215 --> 00:26:28,415
- She's an amazing singer. - She's amazing.

703
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:30,585
(Jin Joo owns the stage.)

704
00:26:30,585 --> 00:26:34,545
(They have a party in the middle of counting money.)

705
00:26:34,545 --> 00:26:37,715
(It doesn't get better than this.)

706
00:26:37,715 --> 00:26:41,785
(They show off their incredible stage presence.)

707
00:26:41,785 --> 00:26:43,115
Let's fly

708
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:45,545
(We're the best duo.)

709
00:26:46,885 --> 00:26:48,045
(It was amazing.)

710
00:26:48,045 --> 00:26:51,015
- Let's find out the result. - We didn't distract them.

711
00:26:51,015 --> 00:26:52,985
That was amazing.

712
00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:56,115
- They got 81 points. - They got 81 points.

713
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,285
How much is the money?

714
00:26:57,285 --> 00:26:59,045
It's about 39 dollars.

715
00:26:59,045 --> 00:27:00,815
- Just take a guess. - Take a guess.

716
00:27:00,815 --> 00:27:02,685
- One, two... - Say it's 39 dollars and 72 cents.

717
00:27:02,685 --> 00:27:04,645
About 4 dollars and 70 cents?

718
00:27:04,645 --> 00:27:07,285
- Say it's 42 dollars. - It's 43 dollars and 70 cents.

719
00:27:07,285 --> 00:27:10,485
- Your answer is wrong. - Thank you.

720
00:27:11,685 --> 00:27:12,885
(They leave the stage after giving an amazing performance.)

721
00:27:12,885 --> 00:27:15,285
- They sang so well. - There was 5 more cents here.

722
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:17,315
We're going to sing, "All for You".

723
00:27:17,315 --> 00:27:18,785
(It's Jong Kook and Se Young's turn.)

724
00:27:18,785 --> 00:27:22,945
- Go, Jong Kook. - Go, Jong Kook.

725
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:24,045
(The girls are getting excited.)

726
00:27:24,045 --> 00:27:27,315
- It's so romantic. - I've never listened to...

727
00:27:27,315 --> 00:27:28,715
the original version.

728
00:27:29,085 --> 00:27:31,645
(Se Young is worried because she doesn't know it well.)

729
00:27:31,645 --> 00:27:33,985
(Jong Kook is by her side.)

730
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:36,015
Start from the right side.

731
00:27:36,015 --> 00:27:37,415
(Will they have good teamwork?)

732
00:27:37,415 --> 00:27:39,445
- Start from the right side. - What are we doing?

733
00:27:40,045 --> 00:27:42,915
One, two...

734
00:27:42,915 --> 00:27:45,545
- Two, three, four... - It's already been days

735
00:27:45,545 --> 00:27:47,385
(Se Young starts to sing carefully.)

736
00:27:47,385 --> 00:27:49,315
- Is this Cool's song? - Yes.

737
00:27:49,315 --> 00:27:51,045
(Rubbing)

738
00:27:51,585 --> 00:27:54,715
- Stop pushing me. - I'm just dancing.

739
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,045
(They start the distraction.)

740
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:57,585
We're dancing over here.

741
00:27:59,085 --> 00:28:00,945
(Careful)

742
00:28:01,585 --> 00:28:04,145
I can see that Han Na used to be a ballerina.

743
00:28:04,145 --> 00:28:05,715
(Her dance moves are extraordinary.)

744
00:28:05,715 --> 00:28:07,385
- Han Na. - I can see it.

745
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:08,385
(We'll mimic her.)

746
00:28:09,385 --> 00:28:12,115
Look at Ji Hyo and Tae Joon.

747
00:28:12,115 --> 00:28:14,485
(The love song is bringing the couples together.)

748
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:17,185
(It's time to count the money.)

749
00:28:17,585 --> 00:28:23,545
(The song is slow. We can do this.)

750
00:28:23,545 --> 00:28:27,785
(They're counting the money to the beat of the song.)

751
00:28:27,785 --> 00:28:28,945
Seriously.

752
00:28:30,715 --> 00:28:33,685
- It's 59 dollars and... - It's 59 dollars...

753
00:28:33,685 --> 00:28:36,415
- You said it's 60 dollars at first. - It's not.

754
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:38,685
- Stop. - 50 cents...

755
00:28:38,685 --> 00:28:39,945
- 50 cents... - You have to stop now.

756
00:28:40,145 --> 00:28:43,045
You got 82 points. How much is the money?

757
00:28:43,885 --> 00:28:46,485
It's 59 dollars and 57 cents.

758
00:28:47,415 --> 00:28:49,985
(Their performance got a pretty high score.)

759
00:28:49,985 --> 00:28:51,215
(Did they count accurately?)

760
00:28:51,215 --> 00:28:52,245
Correct.

761
00:28:52,845 --> 00:28:55,285
It's correct.

762
00:28:55,285 --> 00:28:57,785
- We did a good job. - In addition, they got 82 points.

763
00:28:57,785 --> 00:28:59,485
(They get 50 extra points.)

764
00:28:59,485 --> 00:29:00,885
(They're so good.)

765
00:29:01,185 --> 00:29:04,185
The distraction will get worse and worse.

766
00:29:04,185 --> 00:29:07,285
- It was too much. - You have to get used to it.

767
00:29:07,285 --> 00:29:09,015
We have no choice.

768
00:29:09,015 --> 00:29:11,885
- We'll sing, "Say Hello". - Kwang Soo likes these songs.

769
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:13,715
I'm not sure this song will help.

770
00:29:13,715 --> 00:29:15,985
("Say Hello" by Byul)

771
00:29:15,985 --> 00:29:18,185
I'll do an arm bar on you.

772
00:29:18,485 --> 00:29:20,145
(Please don't.)

773
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,545
Be prepared.

774
00:29:22,645 --> 00:29:23,645
(Focused)

775
00:29:24,485 --> 00:29:26,115
(Stop it.)

776
00:29:27,645 --> 00:29:29,115
So Min must like this song.

777
00:29:29,245 --> 00:29:31,845
(We've broken up before)

778
00:29:31,845 --> 00:29:34,145
- She's a good singer. - This is nice.

779
00:29:34,145 --> 00:29:36,185
(This is nice.)

780
00:29:36,185 --> 00:29:37,585
She's a good singer.

781
00:29:37,585 --> 00:29:39,385
(So Min has an attractive voice.)

782
00:29:39,385 --> 00:29:40,585
It sounds like an soundtrack.

783
00:29:40,585 --> 00:29:42,645
(So Min has an attractive voice.)

784
00:29:42,645 --> 00:29:44,145
She's too close to the microphone.

785
00:29:44,145 --> 00:29:46,585
(Next to her is...)

786
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:49,985
(We now know)

787
00:29:50,285 --> 00:29:51,845
This is not too bad.

788
00:29:52,145 --> 00:29:55,785
(The man kneels down in front of his microphone.)

789
00:29:55,785 --> 00:29:57,015
(The microphone pops up.)

790
00:29:58,145 --> 00:30:00,715
(This is too much.)

791
00:30:01,285 --> 00:30:02,885
(The song nears its climax.)

792
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:05,215
- What about the next team? - Now

793
00:30:05,215 --> 00:30:06,945
(Even if we love each other)

794
00:30:06,945 --> 00:30:09,285
(We should stop)

795
00:30:09,645 --> 00:30:10,645
This is nice.

796
00:30:10,645 --> 00:30:11,685
(The microphone drops.)

797
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,215
(It doesn't work.)

798
00:30:14,215 --> 00:30:15,915
I'm allowed to do this much, right?

799
00:30:16,145 --> 00:30:18,215
(The team doesn't give in.)

800
00:30:18,215 --> 00:30:22,145
(They show off their dissonance.)

801
00:30:22,415 --> 00:30:25,515
Why does he try to sing in harmony when it never works?

802
00:30:25,885 --> 00:30:29,215
(It's not only the microphone's fault.)

803
00:30:29,215 --> 00:30:31,545
(Kwang Soo has to follow his microphone.)

804
00:30:32,485 --> 00:30:35,185
(His microphone never stays in the same position.)

805
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:37,645
(There's no chance we'll get a high score.)

806
00:30:38,385 --> 00:30:41,585
(In the midst of chaos, the money sack is handed over.)

807
00:30:41,585 --> 00:30:43,045
(She shakes the sack...)

808
00:30:43,045 --> 00:30:44,085
(and drops it.)

809
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:46,985
Look at that.

810
00:30:47,315 --> 00:30:50,145
- It's 50 cents. - If you lose it, it's over.

811
00:30:50,185 --> 00:30:52,615
- A coin fell through the gap. - It did?

812
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:55,785
- It fell through the gap. - It was a 50-cent coin.

813
00:30:55,785 --> 00:30:57,685
- It was 50 cents. - A coin fell through the gap.

814
00:30:57,685 --> 00:30:59,285
(They have a hard time keeping up with the song.)

815
00:30:59,285 --> 00:31:01,185
- It was a coin. - It was 50 cents.

816
00:31:01,415 --> 00:31:03,785
(They're in chaos.)

817
00:31:03,785 --> 00:31:06,415
(Count pieces of paper instead.)

818
00:31:06,415 --> 00:31:10,685
(Focus on singing.)

819
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:12,585
(We'll count the money for you.)

820
00:31:12,585 --> 00:31:14,145
Count it.

821
00:31:14,145 --> 00:31:16,045
(Wait.)

822
00:31:16,045 --> 00:31:19,185
(This is such a clever way.)

823
00:31:19,715 --> 00:31:23,585
(They distract the team in so many ways.)

824
00:31:23,585 --> 00:31:27,715
(So Min never gives up.)

825
00:31:27,715 --> 00:31:32,145
(Let's smile and say hello)

826
00:31:32,145 --> 00:31:34,285
This is so much!

827
00:31:34,285 --> 00:31:37,585
I want to kill everyone!

828
00:31:38,215 --> 00:31:39,685
(The beauty has turned into a beast.)

829
00:31:39,685 --> 00:31:41,945
- This is too much. - She wants to kill us all.

830
00:31:41,945 --> 00:31:43,785
- What? - What did you say?

831
00:31:43,785 --> 00:31:46,185
- Who are you? - Count it.

832
00:31:46,185 --> 00:31:49,285
This is 5 dollars. I have 6 more dollars in my pocket.

833
00:31:49,685 --> 00:31:53,715
It's 5 dollars and 12 cents.

834
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,315
- It's... - You can't count it now.

835
00:31:56,315 --> 00:31:57,715
Stop it.

836
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,385
(Give me a chance to count it.)

837
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:02,245
- What are you doing? - You can't do that.

838
00:32:02,245 --> 00:32:03,245
(Their score is 78.)

839
00:32:03,645 --> 00:32:08,115
- It's 29 dollars and... - It's 29 dollars and 62 cents.

840
00:32:08,145 --> 00:32:11,145
- 29 dollars and 62 cents? - It must be wrong.

841
00:32:11,845 --> 00:32:14,285
(Despite all the difficulties,)

842
00:32:14,285 --> 00:32:17,185
(will they manage to win extra points?)

843
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,185
Wrong.

844
00:32:18,685 --> 00:32:21,385
- What's the difference? - The difference was just 50 cents.

845
00:32:21,385 --> 00:32:23,545
- It fell through the gap. - Exactly.

846
00:32:23,545 --> 00:32:26,145
- Was it true? - I told you so.

847
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:28,585
- Was it true? - I was telling the truth.

848
00:32:28,585 --> 00:32:30,485
- We told you. - I didn't believe him.

849
00:32:30,485 --> 00:32:32,585
- It did fall. - Was it true?

850
00:32:32,585 --> 00:32:35,145
- Was it true? - I thought you were lying.

851
00:32:35,145 --> 00:32:37,385
- I'm not like that. - I thought he was lying.

852
00:32:37,385 --> 00:32:39,545
My parents didn't raise me that way.

853
00:32:39,545 --> 00:32:41,315
We were just trying to distract them.

854
00:32:41,315 --> 00:32:43,885
- My father told me never to lie. - So that's why.

855
00:32:44,115 --> 00:32:45,115
What an obedient son.

856
00:32:45,115 --> 00:32:46,515
We'll sing "In the Bus" by Zaza.

857
00:32:46,515 --> 00:32:48,215
Okay.

858
00:32:48,215 --> 00:32:49,385
Zaza!

859
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:52,915
("In the Bus" by Zaza)

860
00:32:52,915 --> 00:32:56,245
(They start dancing to the beat.)

861
00:32:56,245 --> 00:32:58,215
(Cheerful)

862
00:32:58,885 --> 00:33:01,785
(They recharge themselves with joy once again.)

863
00:33:03,145 --> 00:33:06,585
Han Na is intelligent, Han Na is attractive

864
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:10,385
(This song is for you.)

865
00:33:10,845 --> 00:33:14,045
(As soon as Seok Jin finishes rapping the intro,)

866
00:33:14,045 --> 00:33:17,185
(they quickly hand over the money sack due to lack of time.)

867
00:33:17,185 --> 00:33:18,515
Hurry up!

868
00:33:18,515 --> 00:33:20,015
(How well will they do?)

869
00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:21,715
Every day on the bus to school

870
00:33:21,715 --> 00:33:23,145
(Clinging)

871
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:26,985
(As expected, Jae Seok starts to distract Seok Jin.)

872
00:33:26,985 --> 00:33:29,315
(I need to concentrate. Let's not get distracted.)

873
00:33:30,685 --> 00:33:32,415
- I'm not confident - Hey, give me a dollar.

874
00:33:33,815 --> 00:33:35,215
(He gets on Seok Jin's back.)

875
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:37,185
(He squeezes him tightly.)

876
00:33:38,045 --> 00:33:40,115
(Although her partner is suffering from pain,)

877
00:33:40,115 --> 00:33:42,415
(she continues to sing with her nasal voice.)

878
00:33:42,415 --> 00:33:46,785
(Their ways of distraction become more intense.)

879
00:33:48,115 --> 00:33:50,545
(When did they move the microphone?)

880
00:33:50,545 --> 00:33:53,815
(It's so hard to sing a song.)

881
00:33:53,815 --> 00:33:56,515
(I don't think I can make it, Han Na.)

882
00:33:57,585 --> 00:34:01,085
(She continues to sing in the midst of all the chaos.)

883
00:34:01,085 --> 00:34:02,185
She's doing great.

884
00:34:02,185 --> 00:34:05,845
(The song is almost coming to an end.)

885
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:08,615
- We're almost done. - Look!

886
00:34:08,615 --> 00:34:09,915
It's a mummy!

887
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:11,945
- It's a goblin with a huge nose! - It's a mummy!

888
00:34:11,945 --> 00:34:13,915
- It's Gong Yoo. - Their score is 79.

889
00:34:14,815 --> 00:34:16,645
In 1, 2, 3.

890
00:34:16,645 --> 00:34:20,015
- It's 72 dollars and 32 cents. - It's 72 dollars and...

891
00:34:21,055 --> 00:34:23,685
(What will be the result of Han Na's persistent effort?)

892
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:26,415
(Did he get it right even when we distracted him like that?)

893
00:34:26,415 --> 00:34:27,945
- You're wrong. - Oh, no.

894
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:31,145
- What's the answer? - It's 78 dollars and 33 cents.

895
00:34:32,385 --> 00:34:33,945
(It was close.)

896
00:34:33,945 --> 00:34:35,085
We almost got it right.

897
00:34:35,085 --> 00:34:37,585
- Han Na is good at singing. - I agree.

898
00:34:37,645 --> 00:34:40,315
- Your voice is fantastic. - I know.

899
00:34:40,415 --> 00:34:41,715
What do you want to sing?

900
00:34:41,715 --> 00:34:44,185
- Do something cheerful. - Sing a song with a fast beat.

901
00:34:44,185 --> 00:34:45,345
Then we'll...

902
00:34:45,345 --> 00:34:46,945
- Should we get revenge? - Yes!

903
00:34:46,945 --> 00:34:49,385
(It's finally the time for revenge.)

904
00:34:49,885 --> 00:34:52,585
- Go smash them into pieces. - Let's start.

905
00:34:52,945 --> 00:34:55,415
(The last song will be "Me Gustas Tu" by Gfriend.)

906
00:34:56,415 --> 00:34:58,915
- Let's start cheerfully. - I love this song.

907
00:34:58,915 --> 00:35:01,345
Gfriend!

908
00:35:01,845 --> 00:35:03,915
(She has an innocent appearance but dances powerfully.)

909
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:06,715
I used to know the dance, but I forgot.

910
00:35:07,085 --> 00:35:09,715
- Yes! - Um Ji!

911
00:35:09,785 --> 00:35:12,055
My heart flutters toward you

912
00:35:12,055 --> 00:35:14,285
Starting from today, us

913
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,145
(Here's a professional cameraman.)

914
00:35:17,145 --> 00:35:19,515
(The guys are all excited.)

915
00:35:19,515 --> 00:35:22,945
(Haha, the cameraman, is taking a close up shot.)

916
00:35:23,985 --> 00:35:28,415
(It's a melody that never fails to cheer people up.)

917
00:35:28,645 --> 00:35:32,515
(Me gustas tu, gustas tu, I like you)

918
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:35,115
(Seok Jin slowly gets ready to distract him.)

919
00:35:35,115 --> 00:35:37,555
(It's time for punishment.)

920
00:35:38,285 --> 00:35:41,515
(As soon as the song ends, Seok Jin starts disturbing him.)

921
00:35:41,915 --> 00:35:44,055
(You are responsible for your own sin.)

922
00:35:45,885 --> 00:35:47,215
(The camera sticks to his face.)

923
00:35:50,345 --> 00:35:53,445
- Gosh, this is too... - This is so funny.

924
00:35:54,015 --> 00:35:55,415
You look hilarious.

925
00:35:55,915 --> 00:35:58,385
(Jae Seok is known for his looks.)

926
00:35:58,585 --> 00:36:02,145
Keep singing. Hey, Um Ji. You have to go on.

927
00:36:02,145 --> 00:36:03,515
(Um Ji calmly continues to sing.)

928
00:36:05,785 --> 00:36:08,145
(What is it now?)

929
00:36:08,145 --> 00:36:09,415
(Squirting)

930
00:36:10,345 --> 00:36:11,445
(The water attack has his soul torn into pieces.)

931
00:36:11,445 --> 00:36:14,215
I'll be brave and confess to you

932
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:15,845
(Jong Kook lifts him up.)

933
00:36:17,445 --> 00:36:19,945
(This time, it's time to fly.)

934
00:36:20,485 --> 00:36:22,715
(We prepared a variety of events for you.)

935
00:36:22,715 --> 00:36:25,785
(While Jae Seok is busy paying for his sins,)

936
00:36:25,785 --> 00:36:27,245
(she's busy finishing the song.)

937
00:36:27,245 --> 00:36:29,645
I will not forget this!

938
00:36:30,115 --> 00:36:31,445
I will never forget this!

939
00:36:32,145 --> 00:36:34,515
My goodness. Um Ji!

940
00:36:34,845 --> 00:36:36,715
(I'll finish our mission, Jae Seok.)

941
00:36:38,555 --> 00:36:42,055
(I trust you, Um Ji.)

942
00:36:42,945 --> 00:36:44,715
(Don't worry. I'm good at counting money.)

943
00:36:46,415 --> 00:36:48,815
(You don't need to worry about me. I'm really fine.)

944
00:36:50,385 --> 00:36:52,245
(She concentrates on counting the money.)

945
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:56,015
(They're still busy tormenting Jae Seok.)

946
00:36:56,015 --> 00:36:57,715
(I need to take a photo of this.)

947
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,645
(We're all good friends.)

948
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,915
(His microphone is in his nose, and his socks are on his hands.)

949
00:37:03,915 --> 00:37:06,385
(It's a very strange look.)

950
00:37:06,385 --> 00:37:08,915
Um Ji, you need to continue singing.

951
00:37:09,445 --> 00:37:11,445
(She continues to focus on the mission.)

952
00:37:11,445 --> 00:37:14,145
- He's a mess. - Look at her.

953
00:37:14,145 --> 00:37:15,945
(She doesn't move.)

954
00:37:16,555 --> 00:37:17,645
The show must go on.

955
00:37:17,645 --> 00:37:19,085
- It's 54 dollars. - Um Ji...

956
00:37:20,515 --> 00:37:21,715
(What a unique character.)

957
00:37:21,715 --> 00:37:23,185
- Unbelievable. - She doesn't care.

958
00:37:23,185 --> 00:37:24,445
(Leave all the missions to Um Ji.)

959
00:37:24,445 --> 00:37:26,385
You knew this was coming, right?

960
00:37:26,385 --> 00:37:30,785
(Jae Seok and Um Ji's performance has finally come to an end.)

961
00:37:30,785 --> 00:37:32,245
I messed up.

962
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:36,285
(Their score is 98.)

963
00:37:36,285 --> 00:37:38,555
- They got 98! - My goodness!

964
00:37:38,555 --> 00:37:40,385
- Isn't that the highest score? - We got 98 points!

965
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:41,915
How dare you touch her with your foot!

966
00:37:42,915 --> 00:37:45,445
I'm sorry, Um Ji.

967
00:37:45,445 --> 00:37:47,785
If they get the number right, they'll come in first place.

968
00:37:48,115 --> 00:37:50,245
I think it's 56 dollars...

969
00:37:50,815 --> 00:37:51,885
56 dollars...

970
00:37:52,345 --> 00:37:53,885
Wait, just use one microphone.

971
00:37:54,685 --> 00:37:55,915
- Which one will you use? - Do I need to choose?

972
00:37:55,915 --> 00:37:57,645
- Don't be greedy. - He's greedy.

973
00:37:57,645 --> 00:37:59,485
- I'll use this one. - He's one greedy guy.

974
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,815
(He chooses the one in his nose.)

975
00:38:01,645 --> 00:38:05,315
- You said it's... - It's 56 dollars and 85 cents.

976
00:38:05,315 --> 00:38:06,715
(Her answer is 56 dollars and 85 cents.)

977
00:38:06,715 --> 00:38:09,515
(If they get the right number, they'll be the only team to win.)

978
00:38:09,515 --> 00:38:11,315
(Will they be able to get the right answer?)

979
00:38:11,315 --> 00:38:12,715
- You're wrong. - Yes!

980
00:38:13,345 --> 00:38:15,285
What a pity. You were wrong only by two cents.

981
00:38:15,285 --> 00:38:16,715
(She was only 2 cents away from the answer.)

982
00:38:16,715 --> 00:38:19,555
- What a pity. - I was really surprised at Um Ji.

983
00:38:19,555 --> 00:38:21,315
She was so calm during all the chaos.

984
00:38:21,555 --> 00:38:23,715
- She didn't care. - She kept singing.

985
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:25,385
Did you know I was being tormented?

986
00:38:25,385 --> 00:38:27,285
- I didn't know. - You didn't know?

987
00:38:27,285 --> 00:38:29,245
What a liar!

988
00:38:29,245 --> 00:38:31,615
- She missed two cents. - She was so close.

989
00:38:31,615 --> 00:38:33,555
- What a pity. - It really is.

990
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,815
The team that came in first place is the one team that succeeded in...

991
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:40,115
completing the mission. It's Jong Kook and Se Young's team.

992
00:38:40,115 --> 00:38:42,385
(Jong Kook and Se Young come in first place.)

993
00:38:42,385 --> 00:38:44,385
- I can't say no to that. - They're really incredible.

994
00:38:44,385 --> 00:38:46,145
- I can't believe they got it right. - Exactly.

995
00:38:46,145 --> 00:38:48,945
He's really impressive. I couldn't even do anything.

996
00:38:49,815 --> 00:38:53,285
I already told you the name of today's race.

997
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:54,885
It's called Cheapskate Couple Race.

998
00:38:54,885 --> 00:38:57,715
Along with the 15 dollars you need to pay for the karaoke fee...

999
00:38:58,315 --> 00:39:00,485
(Karaoke fee?)

1000
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:01,515
What? You want us to pay?

1001
00:39:01,515 --> 00:39:04,615
You also need to pay three dollars for water and snacks.

1002
00:39:04,615 --> 00:39:06,185
- My goodness, I didn't know. - What is this?

1003
00:39:06,185 --> 00:39:08,915
- You want us to pay 18 dollars? - You need to pay 18 dollars.

1004
00:39:08,915 --> 00:39:11,585
However, the team that came in first doesn't need to pay.

1005
00:39:11,585 --> 00:39:12,685
- Come on. - No way.

1006
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:14,915
- My goodness. - They don't have much money anyway.

1007
00:39:15,115 --> 00:39:17,645
- The remaining five teams will... - Equally divide the money?

1008
00:39:17,645 --> 00:39:20,245
- pay after rolling the roulette. - Make one team pay for everything.

1009
00:39:20,245 --> 00:39:22,615
However, if the roulette points to "Free of charge",

1010
00:39:22,615 --> 00:39:25,345
no one will have to pay. The staff will pay for everything.

1011
00:39:26,445 --> 00:39:28,615
- Let's go. - Only one team will have to pay.

1012
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:30,285
- We'll write down the teams. - Go ahead.

1013
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:31,415
- We only get one section. - Wait.

1014
00:39:31,415 --> 00:39:33,385
- We get two sections. - It was fun.

1015
00:39:33,385 --> 00:39:35,055
- Seok Jin always gets unlucky. - Done.

1016
00:39:35,055 --> 00:39:36,145
It's all done.

1017
00:39:36,145 --> 00:39:38,945
- Se Young has a pretty handwriting. - I can write like her too.

1018
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:40,215
I can't write that well.

1019
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:44,055
(Kwang Soo's team has their name written down the most.)

1020
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,415
- We need to pray. - Get ready.

1021
00:39:47,415 --> 00:39:48,815
Let's end it in one go.

1022
00:39:48,815 --> 00:39:49,885
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1023
00:39:49,885 --> 00:39:52,415
(The fate of the five couples are in Se Young's hands.)

1024
00:39:53,585 --> 00:39:56,515
(Please let our team avoid having to pay for everything.)

1025
00:39:56,515 --> 00:39:59,485
(18 dollars isn't a small amount of money.)

1026
00:39:59,485 --> 00:40:04,715
(Which team will end up having to pay for everything?)

1027
00:40:04,715 --> 00:40:06,645
(Kwang Soo and So Min)

1028
00:40:06,645 --> 00:40:08,415
I don't have to pay!

1029
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,415
(The survivors cry for joy.)

1030
00:40:11,415 --> 00:40:12,685
I don't have to pay!

1031
00:40:14,015 --> 00:40:16,845
- I'm so happy. - You're really one unlucky guy.

1032
00:40:16,845 --> 00:40:18,215
(It's not a surprise for Kwang Soo.)

1033
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,945
Please pay 18 dollars.

1034
00:40:19,945 --> 00:40:22,715
- I had a lot of fun. - Thanks a lot.

1035
00:40:23,055 --> 00:40:25,215
(Kwang Soo and So Min pay 18 dollars.)

1036
00:40:27,555 --> 00:40:30,285
The two poorest couples are sitting together.

1037
00:40:30,685 --> 00:40:33,485
These two couples have the least amount of money.

1038
00:40:33,485 --> 00:40:35,885
When can I stop hanging around with those beggars?

1039
00:40:37,085 --> 00:40:39,555
I don't think you guys are that well-off either.

1040
00:40:39,555 --> 00:40:41,055
No, we have a lot of money.

1041
00:40:41,385 --> 00:40:43,445
Um Ji, we really need to show them.

1042
00:40:43,445 --> 00:40:44,985
These two couples are the poorest ones here.

1043
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:47,845
- I'd love to throw money at you. - No, don't show them our sack.

1044
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,945
Let's show him that we know how to spend money.

1045
00:40:49,945 --> 00:40:52,715
Um Ji is usually very frugal, but we'll show you.

1046
00:40:52,715 --> 00:40:53,815
(They're on their way to eat.)

1047
00:40:55,115 --> 00:40:56,245
(It's time for lunch.)

1048
00:40:56,245 --> 00:41:00,015
Two servings of octopus set dish for our table, please.

1049
00:41:01,785 --> 00:41:05,945
- You must be really rich. - Let's have rice with toppings.

1050
00:41:06,885 --> 00:41:08,415
(Eating)

1051
00:41:08,415 --> 00:41:11,115
It tastes nice.

1052
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:12,785
- This is good. - Hey, Jong Kook.

1053
00:41:12,785 --> 00:41:14,385
- Yes? - Do you want some?

1054
00:41:14,385 --> 00:41:16,185
It would be nice to have some.

1055
00:41:16,345 --> 00:41:19,385
Then stand up and write your name with your bottom.

1056
00:41:19,985 --> 00:41:23,815
(If that's all I have to do, I'll do it right now.)

1057
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,345
(Moving)

1058
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:28,485
Here you go.

1059
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:29,715
(How cute.)

1060
00:41:30,185 --> 00:41:32,085
(The prize goes into Se Young's mouth.)

1061
00:41:32,715 --> 00:41:35,385
(Se Young, you look the prettiest when you eat.)

1062
00:41:35,815 --> 00:41:38,115
The kalguksu originally costs five dollars,

1063
00:41:38,115 --> 00:41:40,415
but if you make your own dish, you can get a 50-percent discount.

1064
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:43,345
- We'll make our own dish. - You'll make it yourselves?

1065
00:41:43,345 --> 00:41:44,385
(Ji Hyo puts in a lot of effort.)

1066
00:41:44,385 --> 00:41:46,715
Wow, how can you cut it so evenly? Have you done this before?

1067
00:41:46,715 --> 00:41:48,685
You must be a really good cook.

1068
00:41:50,845 --> 00:41:52,345
(This team has a table full of food.)

1069
00:41:52,345 --> 00:41:54,145
Hey, don't we look like newlyweds?

1070
00:41:54,685 --> 00:41:56,285
You guys look like a sad married couple.

1071
00:41:56,285 --> 00:41:58,115
(They successfully make the kalguksu with their own hands.)

1072
00:41:58,515 --> 00:41:59,845
Right now...

1073
00:41:59,845 --> 00:42:01,015
(They're enjoying their dish to the fullest.)

1074
00:42:01,915 --> 00:42:04,515
- Let's get dumplings... - Let's get dumplings and naengmyun.

1075
00:42:05,145 --> 00:42:06,555
Thank you for the meal.

1076
00:42:06,555 --> 00:42:09,385
(If 2 people successfully finish 4 servings, they won't have to pay.)

1077
00:42:09,385 --> 00:42:11,485
(They eat passionately.)

1078
00:42:11,485 --> 00:42:14,055
(All six couples enjoy their meals in their own ways.)

1079
00:42:14,055 --> 00:42:16,215
- Let's go. That was a great meal. - Thank you for the meal.

1080
00:42:16,215 --> 00:42:17,645
(Kwang Soo's team: 64 dollars, Ji Hyo's team: 19 dollars)

1081
00:42:17,645 --> 00:42:20,085
- I'm so full. - That tasted great.

1082
00:42:20,485 --> 00:42:22,485
- Did you all enjoy your meal? - Yes.

1083
00:42:22,485 --> 00:42:24,215
- It was great. - I'm so satisfied.

1084
00:42:24,215 --> 00:42:26,015
We're at Gongju where the Tomb of King Muryeong...

1085
00:42:26,015 --> 00:42:27,985
and Gongsanseong Fortress exist.

1086
00:42:28,015 --> 00:42:30,145
I've been to the Tomb of King Muryeong when I was little.

1087
00:43:15,115 --> 00:43:18,055
If you win the next mission, you'll be able to win a great deal.

1088
00:43:18,645 --> 00:43:19,845
You'll be able to...

1089
00:43:19,845 --> 00:43:21,445
(A great deal?)

1090
00:43:21,445 --> 00:43:22,745
You'll be able to...

1091
00:43:23,715 --> 00:43:26,489
- get an Exchange Card. - Exchange Card?

1092
00:43:26,666 --> 00:43:28,066
- No way. - Is there Exchange Card?

1093
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:29,866
We haven't spent all our money.

1094
00:43:29,866 --> 00:43:31,926
- We should have spent all. - Exchange Card...

1095
00:43:31,996 --> 00:43:34,166
allows you to exchange wallets with another couple...

1096
00:43:34,396 --> 00:43:36,826
- or exchange your partner. - Partners?

1097
00:43:36,826 --> 00:43:37,896
(Exchange the wallet or the partner.)

1098
00:43:37,896 --> 00:43:39,326
So Min wants to switch her partner.

1099
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:41,026
You can switch your partner?

1100
00:43:41,026 --> 00:43:43,426
- Wait a minute. - That's a good idea.

1101
00:43:43,426 --> 00:43:45,026
- I disagree. - Wait a minute.

1102
00:43:45,026 --> 00:43:48,066
- Do you have money in the wallet? - Yes.

1103
00:43:48,066 --> 00:43:51,166
For some couples, only women have the money.

1104
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:53,426
- I gave all to my partner. - Me too.

1105
00:43:53,426 --> 00:43:54,996
- The person who has the money... - I didn't give it to her.

1106
00:43:54,996 --> 00:43:57,926
- will keep it. - I paid for the food.

1107
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,466
This is good.

1108
00:43:59,466 --> 00:44:00,766
Can you give me 10 dollars?

1109
00:44:01,596 --> 00:44:03,166
That's if you switch partners.

1110
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:04,826
Do you want to switch partners?

1111
00:44:04,826 --> 00:44:06,626
- Seriously. - I won't.

1112
00:44:06,626 --> 00:44:08,096
All of my money...

1113
00:44:08,096 --> 00:44:10,096
I guarantee you that So Min will abandon you.

1114
00:44:10,096 --> 00:44:12,326
No, I won't ever abandon you.

1115
00:44:12,496 --> 00:44:14,726
- I won't make it easy. - I promise.

1116
00:44:14,726 --> 00:44:16,726
When Kwang Soo breaks up,

1117
00:44:16,726 --> 00:44:18,766
it gets messy.

1118
00:44:18,766 --> 00:44:20,026
Give me everything I gave you.

1119
00:44:20,526 --> 00:44:21,596
Everything I've given you.

1120
00:44:21,596 --> 00:44:24,596
Gosh, he's terrible.

1121
00:44:24,596 --> 00:44:28,226
You'll be divided into two groups for this mission.

1122
00:44:28,226 --> 00:44:30,726
The first part is a free tour.

1123
00:44:31,026 --> 00:44:33,366
It's called "Romantic Fortress Tour".

1124
00:44:33,366 --> 00:44:36,266
(The only advantage is that it's free.)

1125
00:44:36,266 --> 00:44:41,766
(Although it's free, you must climb many stairs.)

1126
00:44:41,766 --> 00:44:45,226
(It's a date that requires labor.)

1127
00:44:45,226 --> 00:44:48,096
You have to pay an entrance fee for the second part.

1128
00:44:48,526 --> 00:44:51,226
It's called "Luxurious Tomb Tour".

1129
00:44:51,226 --> 00:44:52,226
- How much is it? - We'll pay.

1130
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:53,666
- How much is it? - How much?

1131
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:57,626
(With reasonable cost, you get to enjoy the best tour.)

1132
00:44:57,626 --> 00:45:02,396
(It's indoors and offers snacks.)

1133
00:45:02,396 --> 00:45:03,566
(Everyone wants to know the price.)

1134
00:45:03,566 --> 00:45:05,866
- The entrance fee is five dollars. - Okay.

1135
00:45:05,866 --> 00:45:07,196
The total will be 10 dollars.

1136
00:45:07,196 --> 00:45:09,596
- 10 dollars? - Please choose now.

1137
00:45:09,696 --> 00:45:11,696
- We'll take the luxurious tour. - We'll pay.

1138
00:45:11,696 --> 00:45:13,196
We have one team that will pay.

1139
00:45:13,196 --> 00:45:15,026
- We'll pay too. - "Romantic Fortress Tour".

1140
00:45:15,026 --> 00:45:17,066
- We'll also pay. - We won't pay.

1141
00:45:17,066 --> 00:45:18,266
Really, Jae Seok?

1142
00:45:18,266 --> 00:45:20,226
Let's go in the order of who has most money.

1143
00:45:20,226 --> 00:45:22,396
- We'll pay 11 dollars. - They'll pay 11 dollars.

1144
00:45:22,596 --> 00:45:24,896
- We'll also pay 11 dollars. - We'll pay 12 dollars.

1145
00:45:25,066 --> 00:45:27,326
Let's stop. It'll be our loss.

1146
00:45:27,326 --> 00:45:28,566
How about 15 dollars?

1147
00:45:28,566 --> 00:45:30,196
Don't go if you can't afford it.

1148
00:45:30,766 --> 00:45:33,466
Seok Jin made an offer of 20 dollars.

1149
00:45:33,466 --> 00:45:35,066
- 20 dollars? - That's a lot.

1150
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,196
- I won't go. - I'll take the free tour.

1151
00:45:36,196 --> 00:45:37,926
- Me too. - I won't go for 20 dollars.

1152
00:45:37,926 --> 00:45:39,666
Seok Jin's couple will pay 20 dollars.

1153
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:41,596
Other couples can pay 10 dollars.

1154
00:45:41,596 --> 00:45:42,866
- 10 dollars? - What?

1155
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:44,426
- Me too. - Here's 10 dollars.

1156
00:45:44,426 --> 00:45:45,766
What's wrong with you?

1157
00:45:45,766 --> 00:45:47,526
I raised my hand for 10 dollars.

1158
00:45:47,526 --> 00:45:49,066
You can choose two couples.

1159
00:45:49,066 --> 00:45:50,126
Play rock-paper-scissors.

1160
00:45:50,396 --> 00:45:51,766
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1161
00:45:51,766 --> 00:45:53,126
(They play rock-paper-scissors.)

1162
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:54,126
Yes.

1163
00:45:54,526 --> 00:45:57,066
- Isn't Kwang Soo's couple out? - What?

1164
00:45:57,066 --> 00:45:58,666
- All right. - What did you say?

1165
00:45:58,666 --> 00:46:00,626
The ones for "Romantic Fortress Tour"...

1166
00:46:00,626 --> 00:46:02,726
are Seok Jin's, Jae Seok's,

1167
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:04,166
and Haha's couple.

1168
00:46:04,166 --> 00:46:06,166
(Three couples go to "Luxurious Tomb Tour".)

1169
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:08,266
Am I going with Jong Kook and Ji Hyo?

1170
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:12,766
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo are going to "Romantic Fortress Tour".

1171
00:46:12,766 --> 00:46:14,126
(Couples to go to different tours)

1172
00:46:14,126 --> 00:46:17,726
This is where the history of Baekje took place.

1173
00:46:17,726 --> 00:46:19,766
- It's beautiful here. - Is it Tomb of King Muryeong?

1174
00:46:19,766 --> 00:46:22,166
- You're right. - It's Tomb of King Muryeong.

1175
00:46:22,166 --> 00:46:24,166
Gosh, it's peaceful.

1176
00:46:24,426 --> 00:46:25,496
This is great.

1177
00:46:25,496 --> 00:46:27,296
- I've never been here. - It's beautiful.

1178
00:46:27,296 --> 00:46:28,596
- This is great. - Amazing.

1179
00:46:28,866 --> 00:46:30,566
- Hello. - There are desserts.

1180
00:46:30,566 --> 00:46:31,626
There's more food.

1181
00:46:31,626 --> 00:46:34,226
- We just had lunch. - I'm still full.

1182
00:46:34,226 --> 00:46:38,796
You chose "Luxurious Tomb Tour" for Tomb of King Muryeong.

1183
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:42,466
As you tour the historic site,

1184
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,626
come up with two questions...

1185
00:46:45,626 --> 00:46:47,296
for the other couples.

1186
00:46:47,296 --> 00:46:48,696
- Do we come up with them? - Yes.

1187
00:46:48,696 --> 00:46:52,396
- Let's go. - Let's keep the manners.

1188
00:46:52,396 --> 00:46:54,026
Let's keep it common sense.

1189
00:46:54,026 --> 00:46:55,326
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1190
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:57,766
Please start the tour and come up with questions.

1191
00:46:57,766 --> 00:46:59,066
- We got tricked. - Please start.

1192
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,726
- Let's go. - It's over here.

1193
00:47:01,266 --> 00:47:02,926
Is this where the tour is?

1194
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:04,496
I think so.

1195
00:47:05,466 --> 00:47:07,966
- Do we have to study? - Yes.

1196
00:47:07,966 --> 00:47:10,496
(Exchange Card depends on their questions.)

1197
00:47:10,496 --> 00:47:13,296
Let's not make silly questions.

1198
00:47:13,296 --> 00:47:15,126
"Woongjin Period". Write down everything.

1199
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:17,666
- When was Woongjin Period? - This is hard.

1200
00:47:17,666 --> 00:47:18,896
No one will know the answer.

1201
00:47:19,826 --> 00:47:22,066
If I make a question from this, no one will know.

1202
00:47:22,066 --> 00:47:23,826
- The 2ㅜ2nd. - King Munju.

1203
00:47:24,066 --> 00:47:26,426
- King Munju. - No one will ask this.

1204
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,626
(It's like they're members of history club.)

1205
00:47:27,626 --> 00:47:32,366
(The three couples take notes furiously.)

1206
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:35,226
- There's a lot of information. - We can't know the answer.

1207
00:47:35,226 --> 00:47:37,326
(How are the other three couples?)

1208
00:47:37,326 --> 00:47:38,326
Is this it?

1209
00:47:38,566 --> 00:47:41,326
- There's more than I thought. - It looks great.

1210
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:43,296
- Here are the rules. - What?

1211
00:47:43,296 --> 00:47:46,096
The first part of the course is "Piggyback Race".

1212
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:49,166
You will run with your partner on your back.

1213
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:53,196
Depending on the order of arrival, you'll be asked a question...

1214
00:47:53,196 --> 00:47:55,796
about the next course's history with different difficulty levels.

1215
00:47:55,796 --> 00:47:57,096
(Their question depends on the race.)

1216
00:47:57,166 --> 00:48:02,666
(Exchange Card is on the line. Which couple will be taking the lead?)

1217
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:05,496
(Which couple will win Exchange Card?)

1218
00:48:05,496 --> 00:48:07,926
("Piggyback Race" starts.)

1219
00:48:11,026 --> 00:48:13,226
(They run quickly.)

1220
00:48:13,326 --> 00:48:17,966
(They race competitively to turn the table with Exchange Card.)

1221
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:19,126
Don't push yourself too hard.

1222
00:48:19,996 --> 00:48:21,196
Shall I hold in my breath?

1223
00:48:22,126 --> 00:48:24,166
(They start running uphill.)

1224
00:48:24,166 --> 00:48:26,366
The difficult part starts here.

1225
00:48:26,396 --> 00:48:27,996
(Jong Kook passes easily.)

1226
00:48:27,996 --> 00:48:29,996
You have 10 more steps left.

1227
00:48:29,996 --> 00:48:31,926
(Kwang Soo is the runner-up.)

1228
00:48:31,926 --> 00:48:32,966
A little more.

1229
00:48:32,966 --> 00:48:34,826
(Jong Kook and Se Young are in the lead.)

1230
00:48:34,826 --> 00:48:36,466
Come on, Tae Joon.

1231
00:48:36,466 --> 00:48:38,266
They're following us.

1232
00:48:38,596 --> 00:48:39,726
Hurry up.

1233
00:48:39,726 --> 00:48:40,996
(The gap widens.)

1234
00:48:40,996 --> 00:48:43,026
Hurry up.

1235
00:48:43,026 --> 00:48:44,866
(Tae Joon and Ji Hyo are the last.)

1236
00:48:44,996 --> 00:48:46,066
We're in trouble.

1237
00:48:46,066 --> 00:48:48,066
(Jong Kook and Se Young win the easiest question.)

1238
00:48:48,066 --> 00:48:49,296
I'll get off.

1239
00:48:49,396 --> 00:48:50,566
The uphill is hard.

1240
00:48:50,566 --> 00:48:51,596
(The others struggle.)

1241
00:48:51,866 --> 00:48:53,066
We're here.

1242
00:48:53,066 --> 00:48:54,696
(Kwang Soo and So Min win the intermediate level.)

1243
00:48:54,696 --> 00:48:57,426
(The last gets the most difficult question.)

1244
00:48:57,426 --> 00:49:00,196
(They move on for their next course.)

1245
00:49:00,196 --> 00:49:02,266
Gosh, I can't run anymore.

1246
00:49:02,266 --> 00:49:03,766
(Why is it still uphill?)

1247
00:49:03,766 --> 00:49:04,796
I'm sorry.

1248
00:49:05,166 --> 00:49:06,226
Just leave without me.

1249
00:49:06,866 --> 00:49:08,326
Meet a better man.

1250
00:49:08,996 --> 00:49:09,996
I can't do it.

1251
00:49:09,996 --> 00:49:12,096
(Saving money is this hard.)

1252
00:49:12,096 --> 00:49:13,596
Running uphill is so hard.

1253
00:49:13,596 --> 00:49:14,626
(He can't go on.)

1254
00:49:14,626 --> 00:49:15,826
I feel like vomiting.

1255
00:49:16,666 --> 00:49:17,826
I really feel like vomiting.

1256
00:49:17,896 --> 00:49:21,726
The second course is "Up and Down Race".

1257
00:49:21,866 --> 00:49:24,996
Male members will listen to the question at the start line...

1258
00:49:24,996 --> 00:49:27,926
and run up to the partner. If she answers correctly, you succeed.

1259
00:49:28,426 --> 00:49:30,466
If you fail, go back to the start line...

1260
00:49:30,466 --> 00:49:32,766
- Jong Kook. - for another question.

1261
00:49:33,096 --> 00:49:34,926
Here's your question.

1262
00:49:35,466 --> 00:49:38,326
On the day when Baekje was destroyed,

1263
00:49:38,326 --> 00:49:41,966
what's the name of the rock where all the court ladies sacrificed...

1264
00:49:41,966 --> 00:49:43,766
their lives for the royal king?

1265
00:49:43,766 --> 00:49:44,866
That's so easy.

1266
00:49:44,866 --> 00:49:46,826
Number one, Seokguram.

1267
00:49:46,826 --> 00:49:48,696
Number two, Nakhaam.

1268
00:49:48,696 --> 00:49:50,696
Number three, Nakwaam.

1269
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,896
Number four, Baekwaam. Please go.

1270
00:49:52,896 --> 00:49:54,226
What an easy question.

1271
00:49:55,266 --> 00:49:57,026
On the day Baekje was destroyed,

1272
00:49:57,966 --> 00:49:58,996
where did the court ladies...

1273
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:02,026
(He must remember the question.)

1274
00:50:02,026 --> 00:50:03,066
Sacrifice themselves...

1275
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:08,226
(He must climb 108 steps to deliver the question.)

1276
00:50:08,396 --> 00:50:14,266
(Will Jong Kook remember the question accurately?)

1277
00:50:14,366 --> 00:50:16,396
(Otherwise, he has to climb up again.)

1278
00:50:16,396 --> 00:50:17,396
Here it is.

1279
00:50:18,326 --> 00:50:19,426
On the day...

1280
00:50:20,266 --> 00:50:22,496
On the day Baekje was destroyed,

1281
00:50:22,496 --> 00:50:25,566
what's the name of the rock where...

1282
00:50:25,566 --> 00:50:27,626
court ladies jumped off?

1283
00:50:27,626 --> 00:50:29,966
Number one, Seokguram.

1284
00:50:30,596 --> 00:50:32,966
Number two, Nakhaam.

1285
00:50:33,326 --> 00:50:35,066
Number three, Nakwaam.

1286
00:50:35,796 --> 00:50:37,626
Number four, Seokhwaam.

1287
00:50:37,696 --> 00:50:41,196
(What is the name of the rock where all the court ladies sacrificed?)

1288
00:50:41,226 --> 00:50:44,126
- What's the answer? - Number three, Nakwaam.

1289
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:46,226
(He's doubtful.)

1290
00:50:46,226 --> 00:50:47,496
No, that's not it.

1291
00:50:48,166 --> 00:50:50,526
(She screams after seeing the look on his face.)

1292
00:50:50,526 --> 00:50:51,526
Number two.

1293
00:50:51,626 --> 00:50:53,526
Nakhaam.

1294
00:50:53,526 --> 00:50:55,466
(Is it number two?)

1295
00:50:55,466 --> 00:50:56,496
(Is the answer Nakhaam?)

1296
00:50:56,496 --> 00:50:57,766
Number two, Nakhaam.

1297
00:50:58,496 --> 00:50:59,526
That's incorrect.

1298
00:50:59,526 --> 00:51:00,526
(The answer is number three.)

1299
00:51:00,526 --> 00:51:01,696
Why did you give me that look?

1300
00:51:02,766 --> 00:51:04,526
Did I give the correct choices?

1301
00:51:04,526 --> 00:51:06,066
Three of them were correct.

1302
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:07,926
Was I wrong about number four?

1303
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:10,996
- You did a good job. - Will it be another question?

1304
00:51:10,996 --> 00:51:13,266
(Kwang Soo is in pain after running.)

1305
00:51:13,426 --> 00:51:16,426
Kwang Soo, here's your intermediate-level question.

1306
00:51:16,526 --> 00:51:18,066
I'll make it no matter what.

1307
00:51:19,526 --> 00:51:22,596
King Injo of Joseon escaped to Gongsan Fortress.

1308
00:51:22,596 --> 00:51:23,766
Wait a minute.

1309
00:51:23,766 --> 00:51:26,596
Someone offered rice cakes to him.

1310
00:51:26,596 --> 00:51:29,326
As he was impressed by the taste, he named them.

1311
00:51:29,326 --> 00:51:31,396
What's the name of these rice cakes?

1312
00:51:31,766 --> 00:51:34,566
Number one, rainbow rice cakes. Number two, gaetteok.

1313
00:51:34,566 --> 00:51:36,726
Number three, honey rice cakes. Number four, injeolmi.

1314
00:51:38,926 --> 00:51:40,896
Please, please.

1315
00:51:40,896 --> 00:51:43,696
Rainbow, gaetteok, honey, and injeolmi.

1316
00:51:43,826 --> 00:51:46,666
King Injo. Gaetteok. Rainbow, gaetteok, honey, injeolmi.

1317
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:48,566
(It was a long question, but he only remembers the rice cakes.)

1318
00:51:48,566 --> 00:51:49,726
(My goodness)

1319
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:57,826
(Would Kwang Soo be able to repeat the question correctly?)

1320
00:51:57,826 --> 00:52:00,466
Please. King Injo...

1321
00:52:00,466 --> 00:52:02,096
(King Injo was fleeing to Gongsan Fortress.)

1322
00:52:02,096 --> 00:52:04,296
- got rice cakes as a gift. - What?

1323
00:52:04,296 --> 00:52:06,296
(He loved the taste and name it himself.)

1324
00:52:06,296 --> 00:52:09,466
What is the name of this rice cake? Number one, rainbow rice cake.

1325
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:12,596
Number two, gaetteok.

1326
00:52:13,926 --> 00:52:15,166
Number three...

1327
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,566
(He's not sure.)

1328
00:52:17,566 --> 00:52:18,666
Honey rice cake.

1329
00:52:19,526 --> 00:52:20,726
Number four...

1330
00:52:20,726 --> 00:52:22,496
(The choices are rainbow rice cake, gaetteok,)

1331
00:52:22,496 --> 00:52:24,126
(honey rice cake and injeolmi.)

1332
00:52:24,126 --> 00:52:25,296
Injeolmi.

1333
00:52:25,466 --> 00:52:26,826
Number four, injeolmi.

1334
00:52:27,496 --> 00:52:29,596
- What is your answer? - Number four, injeolmi.

1335
00:52:29,596 --> 00:52:33,666
(She picked it randomly. Is it correct?)

1336
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:34,766
You're correct.

1337
00:52:34,766 --> 00:52:37,026
(Injeolmi is the answer.)

1338
00:52:37,326 --> 00:52:38,726
They got it right?

1339
00:52:39,266 --> 00:52:42,126
- Really? Where do we go? - Let's go.

1340
00:52:42,126 --> 00:52:44,666
- Really? - Let's go.

1341
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:45,966
(Who knew So Min was so good in history?)

1342
00:52:45,966 --> 00:52:47,596
How did you know? Did you know this question?

1343
00:52:47,596 --> 00:52:48,966
I just picked one.

1344
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:52,096
- I picked my favorite rice cake. - Good job.

1345
00:52:52,096 --> 00:52:54,926
You like injeolmi? I'll get it for you.

1346
00:52:55,226 --> 00:52:57,496
- Let's go. - I have 80 cents.

1347
00:52:57,496 --> 00:53:00,166
- It's a stretch. - They got it right.

1348
00:53:00,166 --> 00:53:01,866
Here's level-three question.

1349
00:53:01,866 --> 00:53:05,126
Which treasure was not found in Gongju?

1350
00:53:05,126 --> 00:53:07,466
Number 1, 7-story pagoda in Cheongnyang Temple Site.

1351
00:53:07,466 --> 00:53:09,366
Number 2, 5-story stone pagoda in Magok Temple.

1352
00:53:09,366 --> 00:53:11,026
Number three, Jungakttan in Mount Gyeryong.

1353
00:53:11,026 --> 00:53:12,696
Number four, Jikji.

1354
00:53:14,766 --> 00:53:17,126
Go and come back, Tae Joon. Hurry.

1355
00:53:17,666 --> 00:53:18,826
Go and come back.

1356
00:53:18,826 --> 00:53:21,666
(If he remembers this question, he must be a robot.)

1357
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:23,396
What's the matter with me?

1358
00:53:24,226 --> 00:53:25,796
This is going to make me throw up.

1359
00:53:26,066 --> 00:53:28,426
Every time I come on the show, I always get difficult missions.

1360
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:30,166
I always have to go far too.

1361
00:53:30,266 --> 00:53:33,396
Ji Hyo, I didn't memorize all the answer options.

1362
00:53:34,826 --> 00:53:37,266
It was too long.

1363
00:53:37,266 --> 00:53:40,366
But even if you get it wrong, I'll go again.

1364
00:53:40,396 --> 00:53:45,096
From the following, which is not found in Gongju?

1365
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,966
- Okay. - There's...

1366
00:53:47,496 --> 00:53:50,596
seven-story stone pagoda in Magok Temple.

1367
00:53:51,166 --> 00:53:52,866
There's also Mount Gyeryong or something.

1368
00:53:53,366 --> 00:53:55,326
Number four is Jikji.

1369
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:58,096
- What's that again? - Jikji.

1370
00:53:58,096 --> 00:54:02,096
- Number four, Jikji. - Jikji.

1371
00:54:02,096 --> 00:54:06,066
- What's your answer? - Number four, Jikji.

1372
00:54:06,066 --> 00:54:11,066
(Is this the right answer?)

1373
00:54:11,066 --> 00:54:12,926
- You're correct. - See?

1374
00:54:12,926 --> 00:54:14,396
(Jikji is the answer.)

1375
00:54:14,396 --> 00:54:15,966
We did it.

1376
00:54:15,966 --> 00:54:17,066
(We are in last place.)

1377
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:19,366
- Tae Joon. - Wasn't that good?

1378
00:54:19,366 --> 00:54:20,566
That was level three.

1379
00:54:20,566 --> 00:54:21,766
(What a miracle!)

1380
00:54:21,766 --> 00:54:24,166
Oh, dear. How did you know?

1381
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:25,866
(Ji Hyo and Tae Joon move on to the next course.)

1382
00:54:25,866 --> 00:54:27,366
You're the best.

1383
00:54:27,366 --> 00:54:29,696
- They got it right. - They did?

1384
00:54:30,466 --> 00:54:32,496
Let's hurry. They got it.

1385
00:54:32,496 --> 00:54:34,296
(Ji Hyo and Tae Joon are right after them.)

1386
00:54:34,296 --> 00:54:36,366
- Tae Joon. - That was smart of me.

1387
00:54:36,366 --> 00:54:38,026
We should never be up against Ji Hyo and Jong Kook.

1388
00:54:38,026 --> 00:54:39,126
Are they the strongest?

1389
00:54:39,126 --> 00:54:41,196
We should only go against Seok Jin and Jae Seok.

1390
00:54:41,396 --> 00:54:42,596
(Where are Seok Jin and Jae Seok?)

1391
00:54:42,596 --> 00:54:45,296
We're in trouble. There are so many.

1392
00:54:46,266 --> 00:54:48,166
What are we supposed to do?

1393
00:54:48,296 --> 00:54:51,226
Should we ask about something that's hidden?

1394
00:54:51,226 --> 00:54:53,866
We should. Something that's hard to find, right?

1395
00:54:54,366 --> 00:54:56,566
(She learns quickly.)

1396
00:54:57,526 --> 00:55:00,296
- There are too many things. - How do we learn all this?

1397
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:03,496
- I should ask something irrelevant. - Don't you think they'll know?

1398
00:55:03,866 --> 00:55:06,326
I'm going to do this one.

1399
00:55:06,666 --> 00:55:07,666
Listen.

1400
00:55:08,396 --> 00:55:12,066
"Building graves" and "polishing graves".

1401
00:55:12,396 --> 00:55:15,026
(Do you see these working figures on display?)

1402
00:55:15,026 --> 00:55:18,096
I'll ask them to count how many figures there are.

1403
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:22,666
(That's an unexpected question.)

1404
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:25,566
I have a clever partner.

1405
00:55:25,566 --> 00:55:28,566
This is the best thing that's happened to me this year.

1406
00:55:30,396 --> 00:55:31,966
How many figures are there?

1407
00:55:31,966 --> 00:55:33,596
(How many figures are building the graves?)

1408
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:35,726
(You can guess if you want.)

1409
00:55:35,726 --> 00:55:38,566
"Number of ancient tombs". Nobody will get this right.

1410
00:55:38,566 --> 00:55:39,826
(What is their strategy?)

1411
00:55:41,566 --> 00:55:44,826
(Her radar is on.)

1412
00:55:44,826 --> 00:55:46,566
(She looks at the other team's paper.)

1413
00:55:47,866 --> 00:55:50,926
(She scans what he's written down.)

1414
00:55:51,196 --> 00:55:53,566
(Thanks for the information.)

1415
00:55:54,126 --> 00:55:56,826
- What are you looking at? - I didn't look.

1416
00:55:56,826 --> 00:55:58,396
(What are you looking at?)

1417
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:01,126
- What are you doing, Han Na? - I was looking at this.

1418
00:56:01,126 --> 00:56:02,566
- What are you looking at? - I didn't look.

1419
00:56:02,566 --> 00:56:05,166
- That was too obvious. - No, she's not like that.

1420
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:07,366
- I didn't think you would do that. - I was reading about that...

1421
00:56:07,366 --> 00:56:10,766
- across from you. - Come on.

1422
00:56:10,766 --> 00:56:14,366
- I didn't think of you like that. - I'm not like that.

1423
00:56:14,366 --> 00:56:16,196
What are you talking about?

1424
00:56:16,196 --> 00:56:19,026
- I was reading that. - My gosh.

1425
00:56:20,966 --> 00:56:22,426
Hey, Han Na.

1426
00:56:22,766 --> 00:56:23,866
Look at you.

1427
00:56:23,866 --> 00:56:25,166
(She's so sneaky.)

1428
00:56:25,396 --> 00:56:26,466
My gosh.

1429
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,126
(I see how it is.)

1430
00:56:28,996 --> 00:56:32,566
(He tries to block her view.)

1431
00:56:33,126 --> 00:56:35,496
Okay. I got it.

1432
00:56:35,526 --> 00:56:36,726
(He quickly scans through the information.)

1433
00:56:37,266 --> 00:56:39,296
I'm speechless.

1434
00:56:39,826 --> 00:56:41,566
(He's faking it.)

1435
00:56:42,226 --> 00:56:44,566
(You must ask a question other teams haven't thought of.)

1436
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:47,566
- We went around once, right? - We did.

1437
00:56:47,566 --> 00:56:49,926
- I don't think we tried here. - Should we go?

1438
00:56:49,926 --> 00:56:52,596
Let's go. We have to look every corner.

1439
00:56:52,596 --> 00:56:53,596
(Haha was here already.)

1440
00:56:54,896 --> 00:56:56,766
(I'm getting ideas now.)

1441
00:56:56,766 --> 00:56:57,926
1, 2...

1442
00:56:59,726 --> 00:57:01,226
(He counts with his head just in case others see him.)

1443
00:57:04,026 --> 00:57:06,366
(I did that 5 minutes ago.)

1444
00:57:06,366 --> 00:57:07,666
I'll change my question.

1445
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:13,266
I can't believe you found this.

1446
00:57:13,266 --> 00:57:15,326
- What's going on? - What are you looking at?

1447
00:57:15,326 --> 00:57:18,326
- What was I looking at? - I saw you do this.

1448
00:57:18,566 --> 00:57:19,566
(Nodding)

1449
00:57:20,826 --> 00:57:22,926
People might ask about this.

1450
00:57:23,266 --> 00:57:24,696
I can change my question, right?

1451
00:57:25,696 --> 00:57:28,496
- He's counting. - I saw him.

1452
00:57:28,996 --> 00:57:30,326
Let's change it.

1453
00:57:30,926 --> 00:57:33,596
They might ask the number of figures, Um Ji.

1454
00:57:33,596 --> 00:57:35,026
I agree.

1455
00:57:35,866 --> 00:57:37,066
"Mount Maebong".

1456
00:57:37,066 --> 00:57:38,296
(2 minutes before questions are up.)

1457
00:57:38,296 --> 00:57:41,566
(You must get the most difficult question you can find.)

1458
00:57:42,466 --> 00:57:47,666
(She finds information is found only in the computer.)

1459
00:57:47,666 --> 00:57:49,096
(Nobody will guess this right.)

1460
00:57:49,096 --> 00:57:50,466
I got it.

1461
00:57:50,466 --> 00:57:52,866
(Seok Jin is also making a question about figures.)

1462
00:57:53,466 --> 00:57:56,566
"How many figures are there?" Building graves.

1463
00:57:56,566 --> 00:57:58,366
(This must be a hot place to visit.)

1464
00:57:59,396 --> 00:58:01,966
(What did Han Na think of?)

1465
00:58:01,966 --> 00:58:04,126
(She makes a question about Chinese characters.)

1466
00:58:05,266 --> 00:58:08,826
(Write Baekje in Chinese characters.)

1467
00:58:09,726 --> 00:58:11,396
- Um Ji. - Yes?

1468
00:58:11,396 --> 00:58:14,366
How's this? "Describe the current status of investigation..."

1469
00:58:14,966 --> 00:58:16,366
"on the ancient tombs of Baekje."

1470
00:58:16,366 --> 00:58:18,066
"Write it in Chinese."

1471
00:58:18,066 --> 00:58:19,596
(That's a great idea.)

1472
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:24,726
- "Write it in English." - Are you sure?

1473
00:58:25,566 --> 00:58:26,796
What about me?

1474
00:58:27,326 --> 00:58:29,066
You have to think carefully.

1475
00:58:29,066 --> 00:58:32,166
(What is Jae Seok's tricky question?)

1476
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:33,196
This is it.

1477
00:58:33,496 --> 00:58:37,026
"Draw the mural inside Songsan-ri Ancient Tomb."

1478
00:58:37,026 --> 00:58:38,296
(He makes a drawing question.)

1479
00:58:38,296 --> 00:58:39,526
They have to draw it exactly the same.

1480
00:58:41,396 --> 00:58:45,566
(Running Man is a place where people use petty tricks.)

1481
00:58:46,366 --> 00:58:47,496
This is perfect.

1482
00:58:47,726 --> 00:58:49,396
(All questions have been submitted.)

1483
00:58:49,396 --> 00:58:51,966
- Did you submit your question? - I did.

1484
00:58:51,966 --> 00:58:54,866
I didn't know you were like that, Han Na.

1485
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:57,166
- You're so sneaky. - What do you mean?

1486
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:58,966
She stood behind me and...

1487
00:58:58,966 --> 00:59:00,166
(Peeking)

1488
00:59:00,766 --> 00:59:03,466
I would turn back and she would be there.

1489
00:59:03,466 --> 00:59:06,326
(Cheating)

1490
00:59:06,326 --> 00:59:07,466
(And again.)

1491
00:59:08,566 --> 00:59:11,466
(It doesn't look like it's her first time.)

1492
00:59:11,466 --> 00:59:14,466
(She is Running Man's official sneaky princess.)

1493
00:59:14,726 --> 00:59:16,466
- She's sneaky? - She is.

1494
00:59:16,466 --> 00:59:18,226
Each team submitted two questions.

1495
00:59:18,226 --> 00:59:21,196
You can ask one question each...

1496
00:59:21,196 --> 00:59:23,466
to whichever team you would like.

1497
00:59:23,466 --> 00:59:25,466
- This question is for Haha. - All right.

1498
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:27,796
They'll never know.

1499
00:59:28,296 --> 00:59:29,596
What?

1500
00:59:30,296 --> 00:59:32,226
(This is going too far.)

1501
00:59:32,226 --> 00:59:35,026
You can use this. Can we have our question?

1502
00:59:35,026 --> 00:59:36,996
Can we have our question?

1503
00:59:36,996 --> 00:59:39,266
(He doesn't know what to do with this English question.)

1504
00:59:39,266 --> 00:59:40,896
What should we do?

1505
00:59:41,266 --> 00:59:44,226
"Describe the current status of investigation in English."

1506
00:59:44,596 --> 00:59:46,326
Isn't this unfair?

1507
00:59:46,326 --> 00:59:47,926
How's this unfair?

1508
00:59:47,926 --> 00:59:50,166
I asked you because it was there.

1509
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:51,566
- Can we have our question? - Give us a question.

1510
00:59:51,566 --> 00:59:53,696
- This is difficult. - Here it is.

1511
00:59:53,696 --> 00:59:56,326
- This is too long. - What does it say?

1512
00:59:56,326 --> 01:00:01,266
- What's wrong with it? - "How many figures are there?"

1513
01:00:01,266 --> 01:00:03,596
(Wait. The figures must be...)

1514
01:00:03,596 --> 01:00:05,766
- Let me see. - What was that again?

1515
01:00:06,766 --> 01:00:09,496
- This is too hard. - Exactly.

1516
01:00:09,496 --> 01:00:11,796
- Why? - I counted earlier.

1517
01:00:11,966 --> 01:00:14,396
Really? No way.

1518
01:00:14,396 --> 01:00:17,026
- Building graves... - I know this. I asked that too.

1519
01:00:17,026 --> 01:00:18,726
- You did? - Polishing graves.

1520
01:00:18,726 --> 01:00:21,926
I was going to ask that question, but I saw somebody counting.

1521
01:00:21,926 --> 01:00:24,666
- I was counting. - Whatever.

1522
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:27,026
- I know this too. - But you know what?

1523
01:00:27,126 --> 01:00:28,926
You have to be accurate.

1524
01:00:28,966 --> 01:00:31,366
- There are ones you can't see. - All right.

1525
01:00:31,366 --> 01:00:34,196
- I counted them too. - You have to get them too.

1526
01:00:34,196 --> 01:00:36,096
- You won't get it. - Once I get back inside,

1527
01:00:36,096 --> 01:00:38,566
that figure will come alive and wave at me.

1528
01:00:38,566 --> 01:00:40,696
(I'm done.)

1529
01:00:41,266 --> 01:00:43,226
"What is the phone number written on the website?"

1530
01:00:43,226 --> 01:00:45,326
- That's too easy. - This is too easy.

1531
01:00:45,326 --> 01:00:46,826
You would think so. Try your best.

1532
01:00:46,866 --> 01:00:48,466
- You're making me mad. - Go find your answers.

1533
01:00:48,466 --> 01:00:50,766
Sure. Take your paper.

1534
01:00:50,766 --> 01:00:53,726
- Which one? - "Width of Mount Maebong".

1535
01:00:53,726 --> 01:00:56,566
Write it on my name tag. You can rip it.

1536
01:00:56,566 --> 01:00:58,426
(Jae Seok heads straight to the figures.)

1537
01:00:58,766 --> 01:01:01,426
(Thank you, Seok Jin.)

1538
01:01:01,426 --> 01:01:05,026
(He's been here before, so it's easy for him.)

1539
01:01:05,366 --> 01:01:06,426
12.

1540
01:01:06,426 --> 01:01:08,166
(He's an expert in solving tricky questions.)

1541
01:01:09,426 --> 01:01:12,326
"Investigation on the ancient tombs of Baekje".

1542
01:01:12,326 --> 01:01:13,326
(Describe the investigation on the ancient tombs of Baekje.)

1543
01:01:13,326 --> 01:01:15,166
(Where's the answer?)

1544
01:01:15,166 --> 01:01:17,266
Isn't this talking about ancient tombs?

1545
01:01:17,266 --> 01:01:19,866
- This is it. - Where does it talk about Baekje?

1546
01:01:19,866 --> 01:01:23,396
- Baekje. - I can't write all this.

1547
01:01:24,866 --> 01:01:27,226
(Han Na heads straight to the tombs for the drawing question.)

1548
01:01:29,126 --> 01:01:32,366
How am I supposed to draw all this?

1549
01:01:32,366 --> 01:01:34,466
(She looks around carefully.)

1550
01:01:34,466 --> 01:01:39,566
(She's taking out her artistic side thanks to Jae Seok and Um Ji.)

1551
01:01:40,026 --> 01:01:42,866
(She's focused on drawing.)

1552
01:01:42,966 --> 01:01:44,666
(He's studying English.)

1553
01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:46,026
What am I doing here?

1554
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:49,766
The viewers won't find this funny.

1555
01:01:50,526 --> 01:01:52,566
(My blood pressure is rising.)

1556
01:01:53,166 --> 01:01:54,966
When will I finish writing this?

1557
01:01:55,326 --> 01:01:56,966
Where's the exhibit about Mount Maebong?

1558
01:01:56,966 --> 01:01:58,096
(It was her idea.)

1559
01:01:58,096 --> 01:01:59,496
I see exhibits about mountains.

1560
01:02:01,526 --> 01:02:03,126
(She hits the jackpot.)

1561
01:02:03,126 --> 01:02:04,196
Here it is.

1562
01:02:04,196 --> 01:02:08,426
(She finds a hidden question from the machine.)

1563
01:02:09,426 --> 01:02:11,026
(Jae Seok and Um Ji get the answer first.)

1564
01:02:11,026 --> 01:02:12,566
- I got it. - Let's go.

1565
01:02:12,926 --> 01:02:14,566
I have to do this a bit more.

1566
01:02:15,026 --> 01:02:16,026
We can do it when we get there.

1567
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:18,496
(Seok Jin and Han Na get the answer at the same time.)

1568
01:02:18,496 --> 01:02:19,566
Let's go.

1569
01:02:21,226 --> 01:02:23,566
Read the question and tell us the answer.

1570
01:02:23,666 --> 01:02:25,126
Our question was,

1571
01:02:25,596 --> 01:02:30,396
"What is the total height of Mount Maebong?"

1572
01:02:30,396 --> 01:02:32,696
The answer is 8.4km.

1573
01:02:32,926 --> 01:02:34,326
It's correct.

1574
01:02:35,066 --> 01:02:38,796
We had to count the number of human dolls that were...

1575
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:42,396
involved in building the grave, bricks, and tomb furnishings.

1576
01:02:42,396 --> 01:02:44,126
- How many were there? - There were 76 human dolls.

1577
01:02:45,326 --> 01:02:47,496
Jae Seok. Um Ji.

1578
01:02:47,796 --> 01:02:51,526
(What will Exchange Card's fate be that'll change the race's dynamics?)

1579
01:02:51,526 --> 01:02:53,896
Jae Seok. Um Ji. It is correct.

1580
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:55,596
(Their answer is correct.)

1581
01:02:55,596 --> 01:02:57,596
(What? Is this it?)

1582
01:02:58,396 --> 01:03:01,726
(Thanks to Seok Jin's question, it ends in an instant.)

1583
01:03:02,826 --> 01:03:04,296
- The game is over. - The game is over.

1584
01:03:04,296 --> 01:03:06,426
What? What happened?

1585
01:03:07,326 --> 01:03:08,796
I didn't even write half of it.

1586
01:03:09,766 --> 01:03:10,966
The game is over.

1587
01:03:10,966 --> 01:03:11,966
(I only studied English.)

1588
01:03:11,966 --> 01:03:13,466
- It's over? - Yes.

1589
01:03:14,866 --> 01:03:16,596
- Did you draw it? - Yes, I did.

1590
01:03:16,596 --> 01:03:17,826
- You. - Let me see.

1591
01:03:17,826 --> 01:03:19,796
(She's a victim of Jae Seok's question.)

1592
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,596
(She's an artist.)

1593
01:03:21,596 --> 01:03:23,166
- It really looked like this. - You are right.

1594
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:25,696
- She drew this. - She drew it correctly.

1595
01:03:25,696 --> 01:03:27,096
She drew it thoroughly.

1596
01:03:27,226 --> 01:03:29,796
- It should've been harder. - Did you write it down?

1597
01:03:30,096 --> 01:03:31,566
I wrote up to "tunnel".

1598
01:03:33,296 --> 01:03:35,526
Goodness. This is amazing.

1599
01:03:35,526 --> 01:03:36,766
(Let's just use our bodies.)

1600
01:03:37,326 --> 01:03:40,696
Jae Seok and Um Ji earned the Exchange Card since they won.

1601
01:03:40,696 --> 01:03:42,796
Take a look at it in private.

1602
01:03:43,296 --> 01:03:44,566
What is it?

1603
01:03:44,566 --> 01:03:46,096
I'm so jealous.

1604
01:03:46,096 --> 01:03:47,426
(Switch Card)

1605
01:03:47,426 --> 01:03:50,096
- Let's hurry. - There it is. That must be it.

1606
01:03:50,096 --> 01:03:51,326
(Which team will take the last Exchange Card?)

1607
01:03:51,326 --> 01:03:52,866
(Kwang Soo and So Min are in the lead.)

1608
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,396
The last course is simple.

1609
01:03:55,396 --> 01:03:56,726
It's "Archery Course".

1610
01:03:56,726 --> 01:03:58,666
The mission is accomplished when you shoot...

1611
01:03:58,666 --> 01:04:02,196
3 balloons on the target using only 5 arrows.

1612
01:04:02,196 --> 01:04:03,596
I wasn't going to brag, but I'm good.

1613
01:04:04,326 --> 01:04:06,526
(Kwang Soo tries.)

1614
01:04:06,526 --> 01:04:07,526
(Shooting)

1615
01:04:08,296 --> 01:04:09,966
(The aim was perfect.)

1616
01:04:10,226 --> 01:04:11,996
- Okay. - You are good.

1617
01:04:11,996 --> 01:04:13,426
Kwang Soo. You are awesome.

1618
01:04:13,426 --> 01:04:15,666
(I will win that Exchange Card.)

1619
01:04:15,666 --> 01:04:17,896
- I'll challenge now. - Kwang Soo, you are so cool.

1620
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:19,596
I will pick the middle target.

1621
01:04:19,596 --> 01:04:20,996
- Let's go! - Go for it, Kwang Soo!

1622
01:04:20,996 --> 01:04:24,226
(I will gather all the energy in the universe to the tips of my fingers.)

1623
01:04:24,226 --> 01:04:27,096
(I will hit the target and acquire the Exchange Card.)

1624
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:29,526
(He gets ready to shoot.)

1625
01:04:30,926 --> 01:04:33,096
(It ends up on the ground.)

1626
01:04:34,926 --> 01:04:37,426
- I'll really try now. - You did well before.

1627
01:04:37,866 --> 01:04:38,926
- Hold on. - Are you going to buy more arrows?

1628
01:04:38,926 --> 01:04:41,866
- I will. - Now I know why my friends...

1629
01:04:41,896 --> 01:04:43,696
- dated older women. - For additional arrows,

1630
01:04:43,696 --> 01:04:45,566
it's 50 cents for 5 arrows and 80 cents for 10.

1631
01:04:45,596 --> 01:04:47,296
- Buy 10 arrows. - Please give me 10.

1632
01:04:47,966 --> 01:04:49,026
Give me 80 cents back.

1633
01:04:49,926 --> 01:04:51,566
They are coming. We are in trouble.

1634
01:04:52,396 --> 01:04:55,926
(The members join the last course, seeking for the Exchange Card.)

1635
01:04:55,926 --> 01:04:57,366
Let's hurry.

1636
01:04:58,026 --> 01:04:59,266
- Kwang Soo. - Shoot it that way.

1637
01:04:59,266 --> 01:05:01,596
- Shoot as many as you want. - I'll consider you to be my senior.

1638
01:05:01,596 --> 01:05:02,826
(They hoard up the arrows.)

1639
01:05:03,196 --> 01:05:04,426
Shoot as many as you want.

1640
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:07,026
- We're almost there. - Okay!

1641
01:05:07,066 --> 01:05:08,166
You are so awesome, Kwang Soo!

1642
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:11,226
(He hits the target at last!)

1643
01:05:11,226 --> 01:05:13,596
- You are so awesome. - Wait.

1644
01:05:13,596 --> 01:05:15,826
You are like Hwarang. You're Lee Hwarang.

1645
01:05:15,826 --> 01:05:18,396
- Lee Hwarang. - You're exaggerating.

1646
01:05:18,866 --> 01:05:20,126
- So Min. - You look so cool.

1647
01:05:20,126 --> 01:05:21,566
(Where will his next arrow land?)

1648
01:05:22,426 --> 01:05:24,166
(He misses.)

1649
01:05:24,166 --> 01:05:27,126
Go and get me more arrows. We are running out of time.

1650
01:05:27,126 --> 01:05:28,596
Please give me 8 arrows.

1651
01:05:29,396 --> 01:05:30,596
(Kwang Soo's target is full of arrows.)

1652
01:05:30,596 --> 01:05:32,966
How many have you shot? It might turn into a hedgehog.

1653
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:35,366
How many will you shoot?

1654
01:05:35,366 --> 01:05:37,826
- So Min. Buy some more. - Again?

1655
01:05:38,526 --> 01:05:39,726
(Popping)

1656
01:05:40,566 --> 01:05:42,166
- He's catching up. - I got this.

1657
01:05:42,326 --> 01:05:44,766
(It's a disaster. I've invested a lot in this mission.)

1658
01:05:44,766 --> 01:05:46,396
(Kwang Soo gets ready to shoot.)

1659
01:05:46,396 --> 01:05:48,196
Kwang Soo. Go for it.

1660
01:05:51,896 --> 01:05:52,926
(Popping)

1661
01:05:52,926 --> 01:05:54,666
You are amazing.

1662
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:56,466
- Compliment me a bit more. - You're incredible.

1663
01:05:56,466 --> 01:05:58,966
Kwang Soo. You are so handsome.

1664
01:05:59,296 --> 01:06:01,326
(Only one balloon remains.)

1665
01:06:01,426 --> 01:06:02,596
(If he gets this, he will win the Exchange Card.)

1666
01:06:02,596 --> 01:06:04,966
Go, Kwang So! You can do it!

1667
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,096
This is my last arrow.

1668
01:06:08,366 --> 01:06:09,426
You have long legs.

1669
01:06:09,426 --> 01:06:12,026
(He releases the arrow as So Min compliments him.)

1670
01:06:12,026 --> 01:06:14,726
(Will his investment be fruitful?)

1671
01:06:16,796 --> 01:06:18,326
(His last arrow shoots the target.)

1672
01:06:19,196 --> 01:06:20,866
(I'm proud of you, Kwang Soo!)

1673
01:06:20,866 --> 01:06:23,296
This is outstanding. You are awesome.

1674
01:06:23,296 --> 01:06:24,866
I'm proud of you.

1675
01:06:25,596 --> 01:06:29,126
But the thing is, we bought like 50 arrows.

1676
01:06:29,426 --> 01:06:31,296
The winning team of "Romantic Fortress Tour"...

1677
01:06:31,296 --> 01:06:34,126
is Kwang Soo and So Min's team.

1678
01:06:34,126 --> 01:06:36,426
(Kwang Soo and So Min acquire the Exchange Card.)

1679
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:38,196
- Good job. - Thank you.

1680
01:06:38,696 --> 01:06:40,526
So Min. What are you planning to do?

1681
01:06:40,526 --> 01:06:43,196
- I just want to see it. - Are you going to betray me?

1682
01:06:43,296 --> 01:06:45,496
We will go and discuss this in private.

1683
01:06:45,926 --> 01:06:48,596
(Jae Seok's team and Kwang Soo's team acquire the Exchange Cards.)

1684
01:06:49,066 --> 01:06:50,566
Let's go inside.

1685
01:06:50,566 --> 01:06:51,926
According to the results of the mission,

1686
01:06:51,926 --> 01:06:55,966
Jae Seok's team and Kwang Soo's team won the cards.

1687
01:06:57,496 --> 01:06:58,796
It was a close match.

1688
01:06:58,796 --> 01:07:00,366
You can either switch the wallet...

1689
01:07:00,366 --> 01:07:02,296
or your partner.

1690
01:07:02,296 --> 01:07:04,326
(It's a chance to change their partners.)

1691
01:07:04,766 --> 01:07:06,966
When you go pass that door,

1692
01:07:06,966 --> 01:07:09,166
there will be a piece of paper on the table.

1693
01:07:09,366 --> 01:07:12,826
Each of you will write what you want to do.

1694
01:07:12,826 --> 01:07:14,496
(They will write either "wallet" or "partner".)

1695
01:07:14,496 --> 01:07:17,896
If one person writes wallet and the other person writes partner,

1696
01:07:17,896 --> 01:07:20,296
the one who chose wallet will change the wallet..

1697
01:07:20,296 --> 01:07:22,196
and the one who chose the partner, will change the partner.

1698
01:07:22,296 --> 01:07:24,266
- We will change our own wallet? - Yes.

1699
01:07:24,266 --> 01:07:27,236
I can't be completely certain if she won't write "partner".

1700
01:07:27,596 --> 01:07:29,966
- She doesn't let her feelings show. - I don't think she'll switch you.

1701
01:07:29,966 --> 01:07:31,566
I don't think she will try to switch you out.

1702
01:07:31,666 --> 01:07:34,236
- I knew it. - Let's be loyal to each other.

1703
01:07:35,696 --> 01:07:37,796
- You won't betray me, right? - I told you not to doubt me.

1704
01:07:37,796 --> 01:07:40,096
(He says not to doubt him and yet, he seems restless.)

1705
01:07:40,766 --> 01:07:44,096
(Starting with Um Ji, they start to fill out their exchange form.)

1706
01:07:44,096 --> 01:07:46,166
Should I write it big on the paper?

1707
01:07:46,166 --> 01:07:47,236
(She looks around.)

1708
01:07:48,066 --> 01:07:50,896
(She writes it down after giving much thought.)

1709
01:07:50,896 --> 01:07:52,426
I can't believe you people.

1710
01:07:52,426 --> 01:07:54,296
(It's a crucial chance to get closer to winning the race.)

1711
01:07:54,296 --> 01:07:57,166
(What will their decisions be?)

1712
01:07:58,126 --> 01:08:00,396
- Decide which team will go first. - It's important.

1713
01:08:00,466 --> 01:08:01,526
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1714
01:08:02,096 --> 01:08:04,396
- Um Ji will play. - So Min. You should do it.

1715
01:08:04,596 --> 01:08:06,496
Rock-paper-scissors.

1716
01:08:06,496 --> 01:08:09,736
(So Min wins.)

1717
01:08:10,826 --> 01:08:13,596
- We will go after them. - We will let them go first.

1718
01:08:13,596 --> 01:08:15,466
I will announce the result first.

1719
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:16,796
- Jae Seok. - Yes.

1720
01:08:16,796 --> 01:08:18,826
- You wrote wallet. - Of course.

1721
01:08:18,826 --> 01:08:21,696
- You wrote wallet. - I did. What else would I write?

1722
01:08:21,696 --> 01:08:23,866
- Um Ji. - She probably wrote wallet as well.

1723
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:25,766
- No way. - Did Um Ji write partner?

1724
01:08:25,766 --> 01:08:28,926
If she did write partner, I'd be surprised, but it'd be funny.

1725
01:08:29,866 --> 01:08:31,496
- I mean it. - No way.

1726
01:08:31,496 --> 01:08:33,526
(He pretends to be indifferent.)

1727
01:08:34,926 --> 01:08:37,996
(No one knows how she feels. What is her decision?)

1728
01:08:37,996 --> 01:08:40,166
- She wrote wallet. - All right.

1729
01:08:40,166 --> 01:08:41,896
(She chose to switch wallets.)

1730
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:45,596
Well done, Um Ji.

1731
01:08:45,596 --> 01:08:48,466
- I'm curious about their decisions. - So...

1732
01:08:48,466 --> 01:08:51,526
you can switch your wallet with the wallet of your choice.

1733
01:08:52,326 --> 01:08:53,596
I don't know whom to pick.

1734
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:55,796
It looked like Jong Kook's wallet was pretty heavy.

1735
01:08:55,796 --> 01:08:57,496
No, I don't think so. He doesn't have any money.

1736
01:08:57,696 --> 01:09:01,766
The couples who went to "Luxurious Tomb Tour" won't have money.

1737
01:09:02,326 --> 01:09:04,166
- She's smart. - We didn't think about that.

1738
01:09:04,166 --> 01:09:06,366
- That's true. - We don't have any money.

1739
01:09:06,366 --> 01:09:08,996
- Jong Kook isn't reacting. - He really doesn't have any.

1740
01:09:09,426 --> 01:09:10,996
- He must have a lot of money. - Tae Joon must be rich.

1741
01:09:10,996 --> 01:09:13,196
- He opened his eyes widely. - Hey.

1742
01:09:13,196 --> 01:09:15,596
- You know about them, right? - Hey, don't touch me.

1743
01:09:15,596 --> 01:09:18,026
Look at this. Money is sticking out.

1744
01:09:18,026 --> 01:09:19,736
- This is confusing. - Jae Seok.

1745
01:09:20,396 --> 01:09:22,466
- Kwang Soo has at least 30 dollars. - Seok Jin is the rich one.

1746
01:09:22,466 --> 01:09:24,196
He still has 30 dollars?

1747
01:09:24,196 --> 01:09:25,496
I know this because...

1748
01:09:25,496 --> 01:09:27,566
he pulled out a 50-dollar bill when he was buying food.

1749
01:09:27,566 --> 01:09:28,826
Really?

1750
01:09:28,996 --> 01:09:31,666
(Two hours ago, during snack time)

1751
01:09:32,326 --> 01:09:34,566
(She carefully handed over a 50-dollar bill.)

1752
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:36,596
Can you give me the change in secret?

1753
01:09:36,966 --> 01:09:38,166
- That's a 50-dollar bill. - You're so rich.

1754
01:09:38,196 --> 01:09:41,236
(That couple gave a 50-dollar bill for sweet and sour chicken.)

1755
01:09:41,696 --> 01:09:44,066
(Did you notice that?)

1756
01:09:44,966 --> 01:09:46,426
- They gave a 50-dollar bill. - Really?

1757
01:09:47,466 --> 01:09:50,696
(The suspicion about the 50-dollar bill arises.)

1758
01:09:51,096 --> 01:09:53,296
- It was a five-dollar bill. - Give me your wallet!

1759
01:09:53,296 --> 01:09:55,466
- Our wallet? - Yes. Bring it.

1760
01:09:55,466 --> 01:09:57,866
Kwang Soo took 10 dollars as change.

1761
01:09:57,866 --> 01:09:59,326
The 50-dollar bill was crucial.

1762
01:09:59,326 --> 01:10:01,026
Seriously? You didn't see that?

1763
01:10:01,026 --> 01:10:03,196
- How can he have that bill? - We spent it. We spent the money.

1764
01:10:03,196 --> 01:10:04,966
Even if you did...

1765
01:10:05,366 --> 01:10:06,766
- Even if he did spend it... - Give me the wallet.

1766
01:10:07,196 --> 01:10:08,466
We can check too, right?

1767
01:10:08,466 --> 01:10:11,126
(Before exchanging, they check their wallets.)

1768
01:10:11,126 --> 01:10:13,296
- We want to see it too. - I'm so curious.

1769
01:10:13,296 --> 01:10:15,736
(They hit the jackpot. There are many bills.)

1770
01:10:15,736 --> 01:10:18,926
- Um Ji is surprised. - Is there a lot of money?

1771
01:10:19,736 --> 01:10:20,736
(Smiling)

1772
01:10:22,126 --> 01:10:24,596
- There's a lot of money? - How did it go?

1773
01:10:24,596 --> 01:10:26,996
- Did you check our wallet? - We did.

1774
01:10:26,996 --> 01:10:28,496
- Which one of them is mad? - I can't tell.

1775
01:10:28,496 --> 01:10:30,196
You were dirt poor.

1776
01:10:30,866 --> 01:10:32,926
He's the poorest person I've ever seen.

1777
01:10:33,496 --> 01:10:36,096
I spent my money freely today.

1778
01:10:36,896 --> 01:10:38,926
I spent as much as I could.

1779
01:10:38,926 --> 01:10:40,126
(They were the most wasteful couple.)

1780
01:10:40,126 --> 01:10:42,666
- I spent money like water. - You are a true man.

1781
01:10:42,666 --> 01:10:44,026
- Good job. - Now...

1782
01:10:44,026 --> 01:10:45,166
(Clinking)

1783
01:10:47,236 --> 01:10:49,736
(However, the war of money isn't over yet.)

1784
01:10:49,736 --> 01:10:52,396
Now, I will announce the result for Kwang Soo's team.

1785
01:10:52,596 --> 01:10:54,566
I will announce what Kwang Soo wrote down.

1786
01:10:54,566 --> 01:10:56,066
I can't wait to hear this.

1787
01:10:56,366 --> 01:11:00,296
(No way. I can trust you, right?)

1788
01:11:01,696 --> 01:11:04,026
Unexpectedly, he wrote down wallet.

1789
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:07,026
(What a twist. He chose the wallet.)

1790
01:11:07,526 --> 01:11:08,766
(Blushing)

1791
01:11:08,766 --> 01:11:10,826
- He picked the wallet? - He's a real man.

1792
01:11:10,826 --> 01:11:12,096
(He pretends to be manly.)

1793
01:11:12,096 --> 01:11:13,426
You are a real man.

1794
01:11:13,426 --> 01:11:15,426
This is amazing. This is not like him.

1795
01:11:15,426 --> 01:11:17,126
So Min...

1796
01:11:17,126 --> 01:11:21,126
(If she picked wallet, they can retrieve their wallet.)

1797
01:11:23,166 --> 01:11:25,766
She wrote down partner.

1798
01:11:27,126 --> 01:11:29,026
Way to go, So Min!

1799
01:11:29,266 --> 01:11:32,126
(She decided to replace Kwang Soo with a smiling face.)

1800
01:11:32,596 --> 01:11:35,966
(So Min announces shocking news of their breakup.)

1801
01:11:35,966 --> 01:11:37,426
- She had faith in her. - You didn't do it.

1802
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:39,596
- I knew it! - Why did you do that?

1803
01:11:39,596 --> 01:11:41,496
(He's pitiful.)

1804
01:11:41,796 --> 01:11:45,326
- That's insane. - She's the best.

1805
01:11:45,326 --> 01:11:47,566
- So Min. - Good one.

1806
01:11:47,566 --> 01:11:49,396
- Why did you do that? - "Why did you do that?"

1807
01:11:49,396 --> 01:11:51,926
- Why did you do that? I have money. - I'm sorry.

1808
01:11:51,926 --> 01:11:53,596
- You're the best, So Min. - You had money?

1809
01:11:53,596 --> 01:11:56,566
I thought you were going to betray me and take all the money.

1810
01:11:56,566 --> 01:11:57,596
Oh, dear.

1811
01:11:57,596 --> 01:12:00,966
(50 minutes ago upon arrival at Hanok village)

1812
01:12:00,966 --> 01:12:02,596
(They do rock, paper, scissors to decide who takes the money.)

1813
01:12:02,596 --> 01:12:03,966
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

1814
01:12:04,066 --> 01:12:05,126
(He won.)

1815
01:12:07,026 --> 01:12:10,566
(Kwang Soo is in charge of the money.)

1816
01:12:11,596 --> 01:12:14,296
(Can I trust him?)

1817
01:12:14,766 --> 01:12:19,326
(This is where the mistrust brew.)

1818
01:12:20,296 --> 01:12:23,026
- Good job. - He started acting cold.

1819
01:12:23,026 --> 01:12:25,296
- He's like that. - I did that?

1820
01:12:25,296 --> 01:12:27,696
I didn't act cold. Were you born in 1986?

1821
01:12:27,696 --> 01:12:29,866
- Yes. - I was born a year earlier.

1822
01:12:30,026 --> 01:12:32,396
(They were never meant to be together.)

1823
01:12:32,396 --> 01:12:35,736
Kwang Soo, you can take the wallet you want.

1824
01:12:36,236 --> 01:12:37,766
- What now? - Aren't you getting greedy?

1825
01:12:37,766 --> 01:12:38,766
(Give me my wallet, Jae Seok.)

1826
01:12:39,426 --> 01:12:41,236
(You can't take it back.)

1827
01:12:42,126 --> 01:12:44,796
You can't beat this. Nobody will have more than this.

1828
01:12:44,796 --> 01:12:47,596
- Is it that much? - If you become my partner,

1829
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:49,236
I'll give you all my money.

1830
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:52,896
- That's cool. - How much do you have?

1831
01:12:52,896 --> 01:12:56,126
- That one was really good. - Can we switch?

1832
01:12:56,126 --> 01:12:57,466
Does Tae Joon have no money?

1833
01:12:57,466 --> 01:12:59,496
Haha can multiply the numbers, so you can go to him.

1834
01:12:59,496 --> 01:13:02,026
You have no money, so you'll still end up with nothing.

1835
01:13:03,066 --> 01:13:05,026
It's zero dollars even after you multiply it.

1836
01:13:07,766 --> 01:13:09,926
(Multiply all you want.)

1837
01:13:09,926 --> 01:13:11,966
I looked earlier.

1838
01:13:11,966 --> 01:13:13,596
We didn't have anything.

1839
01:13:13,596 --> 01:13:14,926
(He's the worst ex-boyfriend out there.)

1840
01:13:15,566 --> 01:13:17,296
- Do you really have nothing? - I don't.

1841
01:13:17,296 --> 01:13:20,266
Men don't usually carry money.

1842
01:13:20,866 --> 01:13:25,126
- I choose Jong Kook. - She's so innocent.

1843
01:13:25,126 --> 01:13:26,466
(So Min, please.)

1844
01:13:26,696 --> 01:13:29,496
- Why? - No?

1845
01:13:29,496 --> 01:13:32,026
- He has no money. - You don't?

1846
01:13:32,026 --> 01:13:34,496
- Have you made up your mind? - No, think again.

1847
01:13:34,496 --> 01:13:36,666
- He might have money. - He does.

1848
01:13:36,666 --> 01:13:37,926
Se Young.

1849
01:13:39,026 --> 01:13:41,126
- Please switch. - Please switch.

1850
01:13:41,966 --> 01:13:43,666
Something's going on.

1851
01:13:43,666 --> 01:13:44,966
(The others are getting swayed now.)

1852
01:13:44,966 --> 01:13:47,266
- He might have money. - That's what I was thinking.

1853
01:13:47,266 --> 01:13:49,666
- You don't have money? - He was pretending.

1854
01:13:49,666 --> 01:13:52,026
- He was being so frugal. - So Min.

1855
01:13:52,896 --> 01:13:54,396
She picked Jong Kook?

1856
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:56,596
There was something going on between him and Se Young.

1857
01:13:56,596 --> 01:13:59,236
Jong Kook might have been pretending.

1858
01:13:59,236 --> 01:14:01,566
- I don't think so. - Do you have zero dollars?

1859
01:14:01,796 --> 01:14:04,596
No, right? Do you have nothing?

1860
01:14:05,166 --> 01:14:07,666
- What's 0 divided by 2? - I mean...

1861
01:14:07,666 --> 01:14:10,326
- "0 divided by 2?" - My goodness.

1862
01:14:10,966 --> 01:14:13,596
I haven't met a more clueless woman.

1863
01:14:14,966 --> 01:14:16,926
You're so unlucky, So Min.

1864
01:14:16,926 --> 01:14:19,026
- Do you feel empty? - You have money, right?

1865
01:14:19,026 --> 01:14:21,966
I'm sorry but all I can give you is love.

1866
01:14:21,966 --> 01:14:23,266
(I'll give you love and divide your money in two.)

1867
01:14:23,566 --> 01:14:26,126
- But I have some. - You do?

1868
01:14:26,126 --> 01:14:28,526
- You have money? - How much?

1869
01:14:28,526 --> 01:14:30,926
Sorry, I hid some money.

1870
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:33,236
You...

1871
01:14:33,236 --> 01:14:34,796
What's going on here?

1872
01:14:35,066 --> 01:14:38,166
- This is a drama. - My goodness.

1873
01:14:38,236 --> 01:14:40,666
- She does have money. - She does.

1874
01:14:40,666 --> 01:14:43,166
- We each stole 10 dollars. - Didn't you steal some?

1875
01:14:43,166 --> 01:14:46,526
- Didn't you? - I hid 10 dollars too.

1876
01:14:46,526 --> 01:14:47,866
(He took 10 dollars just in case.)

1877
01:14:47,866 --> 01:14:50,496
- Hey. - I hid it in my phone case.

1878
01:14:50,696 --> 01:14:52,326
You are incredible.

1879
01:14:52,326 --> 01:14:53,566
(This is a fun drama to watch.)

1880
01:14:53,566 --> 01:14:55,266
- You can't do that. - You're so dirty.

1881
01:14:55,266 --> 01:14:57,396
When did you take it, Kwang Soo?

1882
01:14:58,166 --> 01:14:59,596
I was pretending to go to the bathroom and I took it.

1883
01:15:00,526 --> 01:15:01,766
You're so dirty.

1884
01:15:01,766 --> 01:15:04,266
If we put all the money together, we would have won.

1885
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:05,366
Forget about it.

1886
01:15:06,296 --> 01:15:08,066
- Se Young. - Oh, dear.

1887
01:15:08,066 --> 01:15:09,426
Try to forget all about it.

1888
01:15:09,666 --> 01:15:12,366
I feel so bad for you.

1889
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,596
- Is this the end? - It is.

1890
01:15:14,666 --> 01:15:16,766
- What now? - However,

1891
01:15:16,766 --> 01:15:19,566
there's a chance to turn the tables around.

1892
01:15:19,866 --> 01:15:21,666
- What? - It's a simple mission.

1893
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:24,166
- What's wrong? - Does that mean we can win too?

1894
01:15:24,526 --> 01:15:26,766
- How much do you have? - Hold on.

1895
01:15:26,766 --> 01:15:28,866
I guess he gave it to Um Ji.

1896
01:15:28,966 --> 01:15:31,566
- He did. - When?

1897
01:15:31,566 --> 01:15:32,696
(Is that true?)

1898
01:15:32,696 --> 01:15:33,966
(What happened?)

1899
01:15:33,966 --> 01:15:35,926
- That's insane. - Is this allowed?

1900
01:15:35,926 --> 01:15:38,866
- I don't think so. - We can do whatever we want...

1901
01:15:38,866 --> 01:15:41,696
- without money. - It wouldn't matter.

1902
01:15:42,166 --> 01:15:44,596
- That's insane. - I'm getting goosebumps.

1903
01:15:44,596 --> 01:15:46,166
(What's going on?)

1904
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:47,526
That wouldn't matter.

1905
01:15:48,396 --> 01:15:51,766
(Kwang Soo decided to switch the wallets.)

1906
01:15:52,066 --> 01:15:53,996
- He's not like that. - Would we get it taken away?

1907
01:15:54,526 --> 01:15:57,926
- We might. - They might take Jae Seok's.

1908
01:15:58,466 --> 01:16:01,366
(Kwang Soo would do that.)

1909
01:16:01,366 --> 01:16:04,026
(She secretly withdrew the money.)

1910
01:16:04,566 --> 01:16:07,696
(Nobody was paying attention.)

1911
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:09,596
Did you take it out?

1912
01:16:10,526 --> 01:16:13,566
(Um Ji predicted all this and took a chance.)

1913
01:16:13,566 --> 01:16:15,666
- You don't have 30 dollars, right? - Jae Seok.

1914
01:16:15,666 --> 01:16:18,526
- They knew they would lose it. - You're the most sneaky.

1915
01:16:18,526 --> 01:16:21,396
- Um Ji has it then. - It was Um Ji.

1916
01:16:21,396 --> 01:16:23,526
- She has it? - She did it.

1917
01:16:23,526 --> 01:16:25,796
- She's the best. - She's the sneakiest person.

1918
01:16:25,796 --> 01:16:27,196
This is unbelievable.

1919
01:16:27,866 --> 01:16:29,066
Here's the last mission.

1920
01:16:29,066 --> 01:16:32,526
The guys will go into the house...

1921
01:16:32,766 --> 01:16:35,196
and hide the money. You can decide the amount.

1922
01:16:35,326 --> 01:16:37,596
The ladies will look for the money...

1923
01:16:37,596 --> 01:16:38,766
and whoever finds it, keeps it.

1924
01:16:38,766 --> 01:16:41,666
Whoever finds the money keeps it?

1925
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:43,496
- Really? - However,

1926
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:45,236
if nobody finds your wallet,

1927
01:16:45,236 --> 01:16:46,696
you get three times the current amount.

1928
01:16:46,696 --> 01:16:48,766
(If nobody finds it, you get three times what you have now.)

1929
01:16:48,766 --> 01:16:50,966
- If nobody finds it? - Three times?

1930
01:16:50,966 --> 01:16:53,126
- This is a gamble. - Three times?

1931
01:16:53,566 --> 01:16:55,966
- Let's bet everything. - There's a chance.

1932
01:16:55,966 --> 01:16:57,496
This is the last chance.

1933
01:16:57,496 --> 01:16:58,866
- Let's give it a try. - Let's do this.

1934
01:16:58,866 --> 01:17:00,766
- Whoever comes in last place... - Is there a penalty?

1935
01:17:00,766 --> 01:17:03,366
has a private meeting with us.

1936
01:17:03,866 --> 01:17:06,236
We have a mission for you.

1937
01:17:07,496 --> 01:17:12,066
(It'll be happening in Gongju Station while everybody is gone.)

1938
01:17:12,066 --> 01:17:16,026
(Which couple will have the honor?)

1939
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:18,866
("Protect Your Money" starts now.)

1940
01:17:18,866 --> 01:17:20,866
- Hurry up. - Let's do this.

1941
01:17:21,866 --> 01:17:23,596
(I have to hide it so nobody can find it?)

1942
01:17:23,596 --> 01:17:26,196
Let me go inside.

1943
01:17:26,866 --> 01:17:30,926
(The married ones are experienced.)

1944
01:17:30,926 --> 01:17:32,296
(The six guys are thorough.)

1945
01:17:32,296 --> 01:17:34,666
If you can find this, you are unbelievable.

1946
01:17:34,666 --> 01:17:36,266
(There's chance to get three times the money.)

1947
01:17:37,596 --> 01:17:38,696
Be careful.

1948
01:17:39,296 --> 01:17:40,496
(Is Jae Seok looking in the bathroom?)

1949
01:17:42,236 --> 01:17:43,696
(It's the sewer.)

1950
01:17:43,696 --> 01:17:46,126
(He's unbelievable.)

1951
01:17:46,126 --> 01:17:47,766
(They are done hiding the money.)

1952
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:52,266
(They hid different amounts.)

1953
01:17:52,526 --> 01:17:54,736
It's the ladies' turn.

1954
01:17:54,926 --> 01:17:58,326
Please take the red ropes on the table.

1955
01:17:58,526 --> 01:18:00,596
It's random. Don't pull it yet.

1956
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:03,766
Two of you will tie each end around your waist.

1957
01:18:03,766 --> 01:18:05,066
(Who will be partners?)

1958
01:18:05,066 --> 01:18:08,496
In 1, 2, 3.

1959
01:18:10,766 --> 01:18:11,966
(So Min and Jin Joo are a team.)

1960
01:18:12,966 --> 01:18:14,326
(Um Ji and Ji Hyo are a team.)

1961
01:18:14,326 --> 01:18:16,526
I was hoping Han Na didn't end up with Se Young.

1962
01:18:16,526 --> 01:18:18,866
- Se Young is strong. - She's strong too.

1963
01:18:18,866 --> 01:18:20,496
(This is so that they don't talk.)

1964
01:18:20,866 --> 01:18:23,526
- You have only five minutes. - Let's go slowly.

1965
01:18:23,526 --> 01:18:24,526
Ready.

1966
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:26,266
Set...

1967
01:18:27,236 --> 01:18:28,796
(The ladies start.)

1968
01:18:28,796 --> 01:18:30,296
Be nice to each other.

1969
01:18:30,296 --> 01:18:32,166
- Se Young. - Can we do this?

1970
01:18:32,326 --> 01:18:33,966
Take your socks off, Han Na.

1971
01:18:33,966 --> 01:18:35,826
You don't have to take them off, Se Young. You'll still win.

1972
01:18:36,866 --> 01:18:40,396
(They must find the other guys' money.)

1973
01:18:42,796 --> 01:18:43,796
Is it not there?

1974
01:18:43,796 --> 01:18:45,426
(They look determined.)

1975
01:18:47,396 --> 01:18:48,666
Hold on.

1976
01:18:48,666 --> 01:18:49,866
(Jin Joo runs away.)

1977
01:18:50,896 --> 01:18:52,296
Hold on.

1978
01:18:52,796 --> 01:18:56,596
(The rope tightens around her waist.)

1979
01:18:57,166 --> 01:19:00,166
Jin Joo, look everywhere.

1980
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:02,696
(She keeps going straight.)

1981
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:03,696
(Tripping)

1982
01:19:05,026 --> 01:19:06,796
Hold on, Jin Joo.

1983
01:19:06,866 --> 01:19:08,766
I think there's something here.

1984
01:19:08,766 --> 01:19:12,096
Let me look. I think I can find it.

1985
01:19:12,366 --> 01:19:13,926
(I can smell money around here.)

1986
01:19:13,926 --> 01:19:15,326
It's harder than I thought.

1987
01:19:16,066 --> 01:19:18,236
(Is she looking here?)

1988
01:19:19,126 --> 01:19:22,866
(Tae Joon hid his money here.)

1989
01:19:22,866 --> 01:19:25,566
(I think it's here.)

1990
01:19:26,866 --> 01:19:28,236
Is it Jin Joo?

1991
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:30,126
- It is. - Did you look here?

1992
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:32,126
She's great.

1993
01:19:32,126 --> 01:19:34,026
(She just has to reach out.)

1994
01:19:34,326 --> 01:19:36,066
Did anyone find one?

1995
01:19:36,066 --> 01:19:37,966
No, we haven't.

1996
01:19:38,266 --> 01:19:39,666
How much time do they get?

1997
01:19:40,296 --> 01:19:42,866
There should be something in the living room.

1998
01:19:43,526 --> 01:19:45,996
What are you doing with the cane, Han Na?

1999
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:48,296
(She uses a tool to search the top.)

2000
01:19:48,296 --> 01:19:49,766
Where are you going, Han Na?

2001
01:19:50,296 --> 01:19:52,066
(Don't look there.)

2002
01:19:52,066 --> 01:19:54,766
Kwang Soo is quiet. Look near the ceiling!

2003
01:19:54,766 --> 01:19:56,666
Kwang Soo must have hidden it near the ceiling.

2004
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:57,666
(Punching)

2005
01:19:58,696 --> 01:20:01,126
(Why would you do this to me?)

2006
01:20:01,696 --> 01:20:02,696
(Near the ceiling?)

2007
01:20:02,696 --> 01:20:04,366
The air conditioner.

2008
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:07,566
- Sorry. - You have one minute left.

2009
01:20:07,566 --> 01:20:09,296
Han Na.

2010
01:20:09,296 --> 01:20:11,266
- Yes? - Is there something?

2011
01:20:11,266 --> 01:20:13,966
(Um Ji walks towards...)

2012
01:20:13,966 --> 01:20:16,326
(Jong Kook's hiding spot.)

2013
01:20:18,496 --> 01:20:23,596
(Will she find Jong Kook's money inside the camera?)

2014
01:20:26,466 --> 01:20:28,666
(Please don't look there.)

2015
01:20:33,496 --> 01:20:35,666
(She finds five dollars.)

2016
01:20:36,736 --> 01:20:39,066
(She stole Kwang Soo's wallet and has found Jong Kook's money.)

2017
01:20:39,066 --> 01:20:41,026
- She found it. - Who did?

2018
01:20:41,396 --> 01:20:42,396
(Um Ji is the best.)

2019
01:20:42,396 --> 01:20:45,466
- She found it. - You found it, right?

2020
01:20:45,466 --> 01:20:47,126
(Did you do it again?)

2021
01:20:47,126 --> 01:20:50,466
- It's Jong Kook's. - She found it.

2022
01:20:50,466 --> 01:20:51,466
(This is her victory dance.)

2023
01:20:51,466 --> 01:20:53,866
- Where? How much? - Um Ji.

2024
01:20:53,866 --> 01:20:56,236
(The others start to get anxious now.)

2025
01:20:56,236 --> 01:20:58,066
- 8, 7, - I have no idea.

2026
01:20:58,066 --> 01:21:00,326
(Please don't find mine.)

2027
01:21:00,326 --> 01:21:02,296
(We have no chance.)

2028
01:21:02,296 --> 01:21:04,126
- They are not here. - 2, 1.

2029
01:21:04,126 --> 01:21:05,126
(Five couples get to keep their money.)

2030
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:07,666
(Jong Kook and So Min lose theirs.)

2031
01:21:08,066 --> 01:21:10,326
- They didn't find mine. - Jong Kook comes in last place.

2032
01:21:10,326 --> 01:21:13,296
He's the loser. We get three times this amount.

2033
01:21:13,296 --> 01:21:15,236
So Min is so unlucky.

2034
01:21:15,236 --> 01:21:17,326
Where did you hide it?

2035
01:21:17,326 --> 01:21:18,396
(She comes in last place.)

2036
01:21:19,196 --> 01:21:20,236
(Here are the results.)

2037
01:21:20,236 --> 01:21:22,096
Let me announce the first place.

2038
01:21:22,696 --> 01:21:26,766
It was a close match between Kwang Soo's team and Jae Seok's.

2039
01:21:26,766 --> 01:21:27,796
(It was a close match.)

2040
01:21:28,026 --> 01:21:29,466
Thanks to Um Ji.

2041
01:21:29,466 --> 01:21:31,666
(One of these couples is the winner.)

2042
01:21:32,166 --> 01:21:33,966
(Is it the rich guy Kwang Soo...)

2043
01:21:33,966 --> 01:21:36,596
(and his new woman Se Young?)

2044
01:21:37,326 --> 01:21:39,026
All you have to do is turn on the water.

2045
01:21:39,026 --> 01:21:41,526
(Or is it Jae Seok and Um Ji who stole the other couples' money?)

2046
01:21:41,596 --> 01:21:42,926
Um Ji, did you find it?

2047
01:21:44,296 --> 01:21:46,296
(Cheapskate Couple Race was full of twists.)

2048
01:21:46,296 --> 01:21:48,696
The winners are...

2049
01:21:49,366 --> 01:21:53,596
(Which couple won the race?)

2050
01:21:54,766 --> 01:21:55,926
Kwang Soo and Se Young.

2051
01:21:55,926 --> 01:21:59,126
(Kwang Soo and Se Young win.)

2052
01:21:59,566 --> 01:22:02,266
(Delighted)

2053
01:22:02,596 --> 01:22:04,066
Good job, Um Ji.

2054
01:22:04,366 --> 01:22:06,196
Um Ji played a big role today.

2055
01:22:06,626 --> 01:22:08,736
(So Min, are you watching?)

2056
01:22:08,766 --> 01:22:10,666
Um Ji, you did a great job.

2057
01:22:10,666 --> 01:22:12,826
If we had gone all in, we would have won.

2058
01:22:12,826 --> 01:22:13,896
(We should have gone all in.)

2059
01:22:13,896 --> 01:22:17,896
The winners will receive matching bracelets.

2060
01:22:18,426 --> 01:22:21,066
(Matching gold bracelets)

2061
01:22:21,066 --> 01:22:24,666
Jong Kook and So Min...

2062
01:22:24,666 --> 01:22:28,026
will be given a penalty.

2063
01:22:30,096 --> 01:22:32,896
We're at Gongju Station.

2064
01:22:33,626 --> 01:22:36,196
It's beautiful here.

2065
01:22:36,196 --> 01:22:38,326
- It's beautiful. - It is.

2066
01:22:38,326 --> 01:22:41,066
It takes only an hour and a half to Seoul.

2067
01:22:41,066 --> 01:22:42,366
- Are we taking the train? - Should we?

2068
01:22:42,366 --> 01:22:43,766
- Are we? - It won't take long.

2069
01:22:43,766 --> 01:22:46,196
It takes only one hour.

2070
01:22:46,196 --> 01:22:48,326
It'll take even less to Seongnam where I live.

2071
01:22:48,326 --> 01:22:50,326
We might arrive even earlier than the others.

2072
01:22:50,326 --> 01:22:51,736
- That's possible. - We might.

2073
01:22:51,736 --> 01:22:55,566
Two train tickets are hidden somewhere around the station.

2074
01:22:55,736 --> 01:22:59,396
The train leaves soon. Find the tickets before that.

2075
01:22:59,396 --> 01:23:01,126
- Are they around here? - Yes.

2076
01:23:01,126 --> 01:23:03,166
They might be around this sculpture.

2077
01:23:03,166 --> 01:23:04,396
(They have 30 minutes.)

2078
01:23:05,296 --> 01:23:07,066
(Let's hurry.)

2079
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:09,596
- I want to go home. - They might be here.

2080
01:23:09,596 --> 01:23:10,796
- I want to go home. - Be careful.

2081
01:23:10,796 --> 01:23:11,796
(I want to go home.)

2082
01:23:11,796 --> 01:23:13,326
They must be hidden.

2083
01:23:13,326 --> 01:23:14,366
(The station is too big.)

2084
01:23:14,366 --> 01:23:16,366
- They're around the station. - How cute.

2085
01:23:16,366 --> 01:23:17,596
Let's look for the tickets.

2086
01:23:17,596 --> 01:23:19,396
(They met a savior.)

2087
01:23:19,396 --> 01:23:20,896
It's a dog.

2088
01:23:22,026 --> 01:23:24,496
- It's so cute. - Come with us.

2089
01:23:24,496 --> 01:23:25,666
Let's go to Seoul together.

2090
01:23:25,666 --> 01:23:27,866
Help us find the tickets.

2091
01:23:29,196 --> 01:23:31,896
(They're joined by an unexpected friend.)

2092
01:23:31,896 --> 01:23:34,926
We have to find the tickets to go home.

2093
01:23:34,926 --> 01:23:37,296
(The dog guides them into the station.)

2094
01:23:37,896 --> 01:23:39,096
Where could they be?

2095
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:41,166
(Wait.)

2096
01:23:41,596 --> 01:23:44,126
(Did the dog guide them to the right place?)

2097
01:23:44,826 --> 01:23:46,266
(They're not here.)

2098
01:23:46,266 --> 01:23:47,496
Where are they?

2099
01:23:48,366 --> 01:23:50,826
(We have to get on the train soon.)

2100
01:23:50,826 --> 01:23:52,366
Hello.

2101
01:23:52,366 --> 01:23:53,766
(Jong Kook is going to look for witnesses.)

2102
01:23:53,766 --> 01:23:55,126
Well...

2103
01:23:56,026 --> 01:23:57,026
They're here.

2104
01:23:57,026 --> 01:23:58,496
Where?

2105
01:23:58,496 --> 01:23:59,796
Look at this.

2106
01:23:59,796 --> 01:24:02,496
(Are they really tickets?)

2107
01:24:02,496 --> 01:24:05,396
They're here. They were around the ticket office.

2108
01:24:05,396 --> 01:24:06,736
(This is the power of experience.)

2109
01:24:06,736 --> 01:24:07,966
Thank you.

2110
01:24:08,966 --> 01:24:10,526
We can go home now.

2111
01:24:10,526 --> 01:24:14,026
We found our tickets at Gongju Station.

2112
01:24:14,026 --> 01:24:16,596
- I live in Anyang. - I live in Ilsan.

2113
01:24:16,596 --> 01:24:17,736
- Ilsan? - Yes.

2114
01:24:17,736 --> 01:24:19,126
- Bye. - We're going home.

2115
01:24:19,126 --> 01:24:21,826
(We thank the citizens of Chungcheongnam-do.)

2117
01:24:23,126 --> 01:24:25,736
- Food Guide? - It looks delicious.

2118
01:24:25,736 --> 01:24:26,796
(We fight to win food.)

2119
01:24:26,796 --> 01:24:27,996
What is she doing?

2120
01:24:28,596 --> 01:24:29,866
I'm here to eat.

2121
01:24:29,866 --> 01:24:30,866
(We run to win food.)

2122
01:24:30,866 --> 01:24:32,766
- Where is it? - We can eat good food.

2123
01:24:32,766 --> 01:24:33,826
I'm so tired.

2124
01:24:33,826 --> 01:24:34,866
(We make people laugh to win food.)

2125
01:24:34,866 --> 01:24:36,596
- I'm talking. - All right.

2126
01:24:37,166 --> 01:24:39,196
(We'll bring back your appetite.)

2127
01:24:39,196 --> 01:24:42,096
(Running Man introduces amazing restaurants to you.)

2128
01:24:42,096 --> 01:24:44,596
This is perfect for spring. We can have good food.
