1
00:00:05,649 --> 00:00:07,685
- Hello. - These cars are awesome.

2
00:00:07,685 --> 00:00:08,953
(Studio in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province)

3
00:00:08,953 --> 00:00:12,256
- Here is the theme of today's race. - Go ahead.

4
00:00:12,256 --> 00:00:17,027
Everything will be carried out based on advanced bookings.

5
00:00:17,027 --> 00:00:19,230
- Advanced bookings? - It's called Booking Race.

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,365
- Booking Race? - What is that?

7
00:00:21,365 --> 00:00:23,667
(What? What would we book out of the blue?)

8
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:28,005
Three guests will be the team leaders today and choose...

9
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:31,008
- two members to start the race. - Is that so?

10
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:35,312
- They will play an important role. - I'll introduce three team leaders.

11
00:00:35,312 --> 00:00:36,413
- Please come on out. - Where are they?

12
00:00:36,747 --> 00:00:40,117
(They can't wait to see them. Who on earth are they?)

13
00:00:41,218 --> 00:00:43,520
(Sandara Park, a famous idol singer who now became the hottest actor)

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,655
Hey, Sandara.

15
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:46,223
(Being a famous idol singer wasn't enough!)

16
00:00:46,223 --> 00:00:48,626
(She transformed into the hottest actor.)

17
00:00:48,626 --> 00:00:50,027
(Now she's here to rule the variety shows too.)

18
00:00:50,227 --> 00:00:52,463
- Hello. - Hi, Sandara.

19
00:00:52,463 --> 00:00:55,566
- Sandara. - I haven't seen you for a while.

20
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:57,368
My goodness. It's been so long, Sandara.

21
00:00:57,368 --> 00:00:58,569
(Wait. He is...)

22
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:02,306
(Do you remember him? Han Jae Suk was the very first youth star.)

23
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:06,310
(He is at his prime again! He's in his golden days.)

24
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:10,114
(Han Jae Suk, a dignified, handsome middle-aged gentleman, is back.)

25
00:01:10,147 --> 00:01:11,749
I think I should take care of him.

26
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:13,417
(He's laid back.)

27
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:16,720
- Hello. - Goodness. Nice to meet you.

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,055
(They are saying hello.)

29
00:01:18,055 --> 00:01:20,524
(Meanwhile, who is this guy now?)

30
00:01:20,524 --> 00:01:22,626
(Yoon Bak, an actor with unexpected charms)

31
00:01:22,626 --> 00:01:23,927
It's Yoon Bak.

32
00:01:24,295 --> 00:01:28,932
(When he's acting, he is the most good-looking actor in this world.)

33
00:01:28,932 --> 00:01:32,002
(When he's on a variety show, he's the funniest guy.)

34
00:01:33,504 --> 00:01:35,973
(3 team leaders are done making their appearances.)

35
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:37,241
- It's been a while. - Oh, my.

36
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:40,944
We have these three guests joining us today. It's nice to meet you.

37
00:01:42,212 --> 00:01:46,750
- Sandara and Bak joined us before. - That's right.

38
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,153
- It's a surprise to see Jae Suk. - I was surprised to see him.

39
00:01:49,153 --> 00:01:50,788
- It's his first time joining us. - I wonder what brings him here.

40
00:01:50,788 --> 00:01:52,823
I haven't seen him on variety shows for a while.

41
00:01:53,324 --> 00:01:55,125
How was "The Law of Jungle"?

42
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,095
- It was very fun. - Was it?

43
00:01:58,095 --> 00:02:00,064
- What was so fun about it? - Well...

44
00:02:00,397 --> 00:02:02,533
- It was an escape from reality. - An escape? I see.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,469
He's talking about an escape from reality. We just started filming.

46
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:07,871
It's nothing special, but it sounds so cool.

47
00:02:08,138 --> 00:02:11,942
- An escape? - Oh, right. He married Park Sol Mi.

48
00:02:11,942 --> 00:02:16,213
It could have been great if she also joined us with you.

49
00:02:16,447 --> 00:02:17,548
She had to take care of the children.

50
00:02:18,082 --> 00:02:20,117
(Gentle laughs)

51
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:22,853
- He laughs like an actor too. - He does indeed.

52
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:27,257
I've heard someone laugh like this, but Jae Suk laughs like this.

53
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:29,226
(Laughing)

54
00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:32,863
We can literally write down the sound of his laughter.

55
00:02:32,863 --> 00:02:35,933
- We have the same name. - That's right.

56
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:38,001
- But you two are so different. - But you are not the same.

57
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:41,405
- You two are completely different. - I didn't realize it until now.

58
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:42,973
He's the Jae Suk among the actors.

59
00:02:42,973 --> 00:02:45,743
I'm sorry, but he should've approved of your name beforehand.

60
00:02:45,743 --> 00:02:48,579
- Did you get that? - I was born before he was.

61
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:50,681
- Really? - You were born in 1973, right?

62
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:52,750
- See? I was born first. - I can't believe...

63
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,618
you two were born in the same country.

64
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:57,755
- He's handsome. - He looks handsome next to you.

65
00:02:57,755 --> 00:03:00,324
- You look really pretty, Sandara. - Oh, right.

66
00:03:00,357 --> 00:03:02,526
- Your names are similar too. - My name is Yoon Bak.

67
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:06,230
- Her name is Sandara Park. - It's her last name.

68
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,465
- Her last name is Park. - His first name is Bak.

69
00:03:08,465 --> 00:03:10,334
Right. That's exactly my point.

70
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:13,003
- You were wrong. - You had it wrong.

71
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:15,205
- Admit that you were wrong. - Accept that you made a mistake.

72
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:18,409
- How was I wrong? - You can't mess up their names.

73
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:21,512
- Their names sound similar anyway. - Her last name is Park.

74
00:03:21,512 --> 00:03:24,748
It must be hard for Jae Seok. He has no common grounds with them.

75
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:26,950
- Let's just agree with him. - Goodness.

76
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,355
- Are they strings on your outfit? - Don't pick a fight with me.

77
00:03:31,455 --> 00:03:33,624
- Don't tease me for no reason. - Let me see. They're coming out.

78
00:03:33,624 --> 00:03:35,526
- Sorry, but let me have them. - I can pull them off.

79
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:39,830
- Stop. It's hard to put them back. - Can they be pulled out?

80
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,499
- What on earth are these? - If you pull them out...

81
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:45,402
- Can we pull out presents from it? - All of them are pulled out!

82
00:03:45,402 --> 00:03:47,538
What happened to this? Where did it go?

83
00:03:47,538 --> 00:03:51,074
How will I put them back? It will take forever. He's so annoying.

84
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:54,144
- Over fitted outfit is trendy now. - Haha. It won't take long.

85
00:03:54,144 --> 00:03:56,847
- Over fitted outfit? - I will do this for you.

86
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:00,150
- People often wear it like that. - Don't you worry.

87
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,253
There's no need for you to worry. Long time ago, my mom...

88
00:04:03,253 --> 00:04:06,156
- did this for me. - Sandara. Please talk to him.

89
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:09,827
I'm about to lose my mind. He always wears shorts except during winter.

90
00:04:10,427 --> 00:04:14,097
He wears a t-shirt with jeans. They know nothing about fashion.

91
00:04:14,097 --> 00:04:16,333
- That's fashionable. - What on earth is this?

92
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:19,903
- Hey, you should tie your earrings. - Oh, sure.

93
00:04:20,037 --> 00:04:22,840
- Stop it. - She can't leave them dragging.

94
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,409
- She looks fine. - This is driving me crazy.

95
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:28,011
- Sandara. You are... Goodness. - Yes?

96
00:04:28,011 --> 00:04:29,947
What? She is what?

97
00:04:29,947 --> 00:04:31,849
- "Goodness." - I guess you have nothing to say.

98
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:34,117
- Finish what you were saying. - Recently, she shot a film.

99
00:04:34,117 --> 00:04:35,686
She sent me a trailer for that.

100
00:04:35,686 --> 00:04:39,423
- Really? - So she's an actress now.

101
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:41,425
She is all over the entertainment industry.

102
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:44,027
- Can I ask the roles you played? - Can we?

103
00:04:44,695 --> 00:04:48,732
- I played the role of a songwriter. - What?

104
00:04:48,732 --> 00:04:49,733
You played the role of a musician.

105
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,302
My role used to be a famous songwriter.

106
00:04:52,503 --> 00:04:55,606
Well... Then he was burned out.

107
00:04:55,606 --> 00:04:58,876
When he can't create new songs, he meets...

108
00:04:59,576 --> 00:05:01,445
- a genius songwriter. - He meets a genius songwriter.

109
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:03,580
I'm sorry to interrupt, but you speak so slowly.

110
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,850
- At this time, we're supposed to... - Please let him finish.

111
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,053
- finish at least two interviews. - I see.

112
00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:11,955
I think it's funnier than your tying his clothes.

113
00:05:12,656 --> 00:05:15,359
(With his low voice, he says what is on his mind.)

114
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,527
(He targets Jae Seok from the start.)

115
00:05:16,527 --> 00:05:17,895
- Jae Suk. - Great job.

116
00:05:18,462 --> 00:05:21,131
- What? It wasn't meant for you. - It wasn't?

117
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:22,533
(This is a piece of cake.)

118
00:05:24,134 --> 00:05:26,603
- All of you are wearing badges. - Right.

119
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,839
(What are these badges?)

120
00:05:29,973 --> 00:05:33,977
Let me explain about the badges. Before your arrival,

121
00:05:34,011 --> 00:05:37,881
the team leaders have already booked the prize for the winning team.

122
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:38,882
(They already booked the prize.)

123
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:42,486
Hello.

124
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:44,721
Today, you guys will be reserving...

125
00:05:44,855 --> 00:05:47,558
all the missions in advance.

126
00:05:47,558 --> 00:05:49,927
It's called Booking Race.

127
00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:53,730
The 3 of you need to choose 2 other team members.

128
00:05:53,964 --> 00:05:57,034
- Then you'll do the race as a team. - Okay.

129
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,269
Is there anyone you'd like to choose in advance?

130
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:01,772
I'd like to have Jong Kook on my team.

131
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:03,507
He's mine.

132
00:06:04,575 --> 00:06:08,312
I'll just choose whoever's left after they choose their members.

133
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:10,147
(Relaxed)

134
00:06:10,147 --> 00:06:11,181
I'd like to...

135
00:06:12,282 --> 00:06:14,518
choose Seok Jin. I feel comfortable around him.

136
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:18,121
(His choice goes well with him.)

137
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:20,424
Before starting the actual race,

138
00:06:20,857 --> 00:06:22,125
let's start with the first booking.

139
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:25,128
You'll each need to choose the final winning award.

140
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:30,033
- It's ginseng. - Look. It's wild ginseng.

141
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,268
- It's ginseng. - I see.

142
00:06:31,268 --> 00:06:32,936
There's also a ticket for an overseas trip.

143
00:06:33,337 --> 00:06:35,472
- Is that real gold? - Yes.

144
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:37,708
That's too small.

145
00:06:38,742 --> 00:06:41,878
I want to go abroad, so I choose the ticket for an overseas trip.

146
00:06:41,878 --> 00:06:43,380
As for me,

147
00:06:43,814 --> 00:06:45,949
(Jae Suk chooses...)

148
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:47,184
I choose the ginseng.

149
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:48,852
(the premium ginseng set.)

150
00:06:48,852 --> 00:06:50,687
I want the ginseng set too.

151
00:06:51,054 --> 00:06:53,523
You're still young. Why don't you choose this?

152
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:55,959
Then I'll choose...

153
00:06:56,226 --> 00:06:57,227
the gold.

154
00:07:00,897 --> 00:07:04,468
(They finish choosing their winning awards.)

155
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:07,004
- Where are we going abroad? - I want to go abroad.

156
00:07:07,337 --> 00:07:09,873
- The location is what's important. - Are you okay with just ginseng?

157
00:07:09,873 --> 00:07:11,341
They're getting gold and a ticket to go abroad.

158
00:07:11,341 --> 00:07:13,210
Ginseng is a more realistic choice for me.

159
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,277
- Really? - Yes.

160
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:17,614
- He's so honest. - I'm sorry to say this,

161
00:07:17,614 --> 00:07:20,350
but the way you talk right now...

162
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,619
makes it sound like you were forced to come here.

163
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:23,820
- Am I right? - No.

164
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:25,255
He keeps sighing like this.

165
00:07:25,722 --> 00:07:27,524
Exactly. You just sounded like him.

166
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:29,626
- I know. - Okay.

167
00:07:29,626 --> 00:07:32,429
So what's happening? Do we choose teams now?

168
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:35,298
All six members of Running Man will choose...

169
00:07:35,298 --> 00:07:37,768
- a car each and sit inside it. - One person per car?

170
00:07:37,768 --> 00:07:39,403
Once you're waiting inside the car,

171
00:07:39,603 --> 00:07:42,739
the three team leaders will dance to the music...

172
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:45,042
and sit beside a member they'd like to choose.

173
00:07:45,642 --> 00:07:46,843
If you like that team leader,

174
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,113
you just have to get off together.

175
00:07:50,113 --> 00:07:52,215
If not, you can just stay in your seat.

176
00:07:52,215 --> 00:07:54,051
- Then let's each choose a car. - Yes, go ahead.

177
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:55,886
- Can we choose any car? - Yes.

178
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:57,854
- I'm going to choose that one. - Do we just get on?

179
00:07:58,622 --> 00:08:00,857
- You know how much I like that car. - I want to get on the truck too.

180
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:03,126
(I need to choose a pretty car so I can stand out.)

181
00:08:03,126 --> 00:08:04,528
It's spacious.

182
00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:08,799
(Excited)

183
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:10,967
"Transformer Optimus Prime".

184
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:13,770
- Are you ready? - Yes.

185
00:08:14,404 --> 00:08:17,174
(Everyone's ready to get booked.)

186
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,710
(Let the booking begin.)

187
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,711
What's the music?

188
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:22,112
- What? - My gosh.

189
00:08:22,713 --> 00:08:23,980
- What's this? - What's going on?

190
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,315
(Who will get chosen first?)

191
00:08:25,315 --> 00:08:27,517
- He's coming. - I'm nervous.

192
00:08:27,517 --> 00:08:29,953
- Come on. - He's coming here.

193
00:08:31,254 --> 00:08:32,622
Hey, Bak!

194
00:08:33,457 --> 00:08:36,426
(Dancing)

195
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:38,695
Hey, Bak.

196
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:42,365
(He goes straight to Seok Jin.)

197
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,401
Would you like to join me?

198
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:46,603
- Do you want to be on my team? - Of course.

199
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,842
(Is Bak seriously choosing Seok Jin?)

200
00:08:51,842 --> 00:08:53,777
- Would you like to be on my team? - Of course.

201
00:08:53,777 --> 00:08:55,345
- Will you join me? - Of course, Bak.

202
00:08:55,345 --> 00:08:56,780
Why is he sitting on his lap?

203
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,115
- We're on the same team. - We are?

204
00:08:58,115 --> 00:08:59,249
- Yes. - Really?

205
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:00,517
- Okay, let's do this! - Yes!

206
00:09:00,517 --> 00:09:03,153
- Yes! This is great. - Whom else should we choose?

207
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,488
Let's see.

208
00:09:05,355 --> 00:09:07,724
We need someone who's better than us at something.

209
00:09:07,824 --> 00:09:09,559
- You think so? - They should either be smarter...

210
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:11,528
or stronger than us.

211
00:09:11,528 --> 00:09:13,029
- What do you think about Kwang Soo? - Kwang Soo?

212
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:14,331
- Let's go together. - What?

213
00:09:14,331 --> 00:09:15,499
Let's go get him together.

214
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:19,102
(They head to their next target.)

215
00:09:19,536 --> 00:09:21,004
Did Seok Jin get chosen?

216
00:09:21,605 --> 00:09:22,672
He got chosen first?

217
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:25,609
That truck is really high.

218
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:27,344
How can we go up there?

219
00:09:27,577 --> 00:09:29,746
- They're coming this way. - Why aren't you looking at us?

220
00:09:30,347 --> 00:09:31,481
(Why are you avoiding us?)

221
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:32,649
Hey, stop avoiding us.

222
00:09:33,283 --> 00:09:35,285
- Hey. - I just might choose you.

223
00:09:35,285 --> 00:09:36,953
- Excuse me. - I'm going to choose you.

224
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,655
Look to your left.

225
00:09:39,823 --> 00:09:40,891
(We're not meant to be.)

226
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:42,225
- This isn't going to work. - Hey.

227
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:43,827
I'm going to choose you.

228
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:45,762
This won't work. We can't force him.

229
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:47,230
Let's go.

230
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:50,233
Are they coming here?

231
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:51,768
(Nervous)

232
00:09:51,768 --> 00:09:54,004
(Are they coming for me?)

233
00:09:54,004 --> 00:09:55,038
Hey.

234
00:09:56,072 --> 00:09:57,107
(They surround Kwang Soo from each side.)

235
00:09:57,107 --> 00:09:58,275
Hey, Bak.

236
00:09:58,441 --> 00:09:59,876
- Hello. - Hey.

237
00:09:59,876 --> 00:10:01,711
What brings you here?

238
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:03,847
We should get together...

239
00:10:04,114 --> 00:10:05,248
- and show them. - No.

240
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:07,851
We should show them what we can do.

241
00:10:07,851 --> 00:10:09,786
- Wait. Wait. - Hey.

242
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:13,256
- Bak really wants you on our team. - Come on.

243
00:10:13,757 --> 00:10:15,225
With our teamwork,

244
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:17,727
we can take the winning prize.

245
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,163
- He's older than us. - So you think we can win?

246
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:21,264
- Shall we give it a go? - Let's do it.

247
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:22,432
- Shall we? - Yes.

248
00:10:22,432 --> 00:10:23,600
- Let's do it! - Really?

249
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,235
- Let's show them! - Okay!

250
00:10:26,136 --> 00:10:29,739
(Okay, let's go!)

251
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:32,409
(That was a lie.)

252
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:34,211
(He tries to open the door.)

253
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:37,414
No. I don't want to!

254
00:10:37,414 --> 00:10:39,583
- Come on. - No!

255
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,817
Sandara...

256
00:10:41,117 --> 00:10:42,986
- I want to be on Sandara's team! - How can you do this?

257
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:44,120
How can you betray me?

258
00:10:44,387 --> 00:10:46,556
- I don't want to! - You already said yes.

259
00:10:46,857 --> 00:10:48,625
How does this lock?

260
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:53,530
How can I lock the door?

261
00:10:54,798 --> 00:10:55,832
Come on.

262
00:10:55,832 --> 00:10:57,500
You got off, so you're on their team.

263
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,970
(What did you say?)

264
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,037
Okay.

265
00:11:01,271 --> 00:11:02,606
He came out on his own.

266
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,474
- That's it? - Congratulations.

267
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:06,009
Can you play Sting's song?

268
00:11:06,943 --> 00:11:08,078
(Do you mean this song?)

269
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:09,813
My gosh, that was funny.

270
00:11:11,481 --> 00:11:13,216
- How funny. - Bye!

271
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:15,218
(Bak chooses Seok Jin and Kwang Soo.)

272
00:11:16,253 --> 00:11:17,888
I should leave the door open now.

273
00:11:18,722 --> 00:11:20,523
Sandara, please proceed.

274
00:11:21,825 --> 00:11:23,827
(It's Sandara's turn to choose.)

275
00:11:23,827 --> 00:11:25,161
"I Am the Best".

276
00:11:25,161 --> 00:11:27,330
- It's Sandara's turn. - "I Am the Best".

277
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,766
- Sandara, look here! - Sandara, come on!

278
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:31,568
- Sandara! - Come on, Sandara!

279
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:33,003
- Sandara! - She's on her way!

280
00:11:33,403 --> 00:11:35,171
You're the best!

281
00:11:35,772 --> 00:11:37,574
(I'm the queen of booking.)

282
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:39,542
I am the best

283
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:42,112
- You're the best! - I am the best

284
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:44,014
Sandara, come on!

285
00:11:44,514 --> 00:11:46,016
(She looks around.)

286
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:50,120
Look at Haha.

287
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:54,524
(She starts warming up by dancing.)

288
00:11:56,126 --> 00:11:58,061
(She expresses her interest towards her target.)

289
00:11:58,061 --> 00:11:59,462
- She's going for Jae Seok. - Hey!

290
00:11:59,462 --> 00:12:00,664
- It's Jae Seok. - Stop!

291
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:02,465
She's going straight to Jae Seok.

292
00:12:02,465 --> 00:12:04,901
I'll be the team leader this time.

293
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:06,636
- Sure. - Will you be on my team?

294
00:12:06,636 --> 00:12:08,538
Okay!

295
00:12:09,372 --> 00:12:12,542
- That's so unfair. - Okay!

296
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:14,444
They're so annoying.

297
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:16,479
We also need...

298
00:12:16,713 --> 00:12:19,249
- someone strong. - Is that so?

299
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,217
(We know who it is.)

300
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,655
(It's Kim Jong Kook.)

301
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:26,823
(Are they coming for me?)

302
00:12:26,823 --> 00:12:27,958
They're going for Jong Kook.

303
00:12:28,425 --> 00:12:30,060
I can't believe this.

304
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,962
- He really likes it. - Isn't that unfair?

305
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:34,731
(Before choosing, she elevates the mood by dancing.)

306
00:12:34,864 --> 00:12:36,599
That's not fair. She can't do that.

307
00:12:38,435 --> 00:12:40,837
Hey, Sandara. Do you choose Jong Kook?

308
00:12:41,271 --> 00:12:42,639
Do you want Jong Kook?

309
00:12:44,407 --> 00:12:46,042
(Entering)

310
00:12:46,743 --> 00:12:48,712
My goodness. Would you like to join us?

311
00:12:48,712 --> 00:12:50,380
Of course. I'd love to.

312
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,648
Let's do this.

313
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:53,750
(Sandara chooses Jae Seok and Jong Kook.)

314
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,919
- I am the best - She didn't choose you.

315
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,153
- She chose Jong Kook? - She didn't...

316
00:12:57,153 --> 00:12:58,421
You chose Jong Kook?

317
00:12:59,556 --> 00:13:01,458
Things can still change.

318
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,926
- The game's already over. - What is this?

319
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:04,661
What's happening today?

320
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:06,262
- Things can still change. - It's game over.

321
00:13:06,663 --> 00:13:08,832
- Hey, we're... - I am the best

322
00:13:08,832 --> 00:13:10,233
We have the best team.

323
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:12,168
Are we a team now?

324
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:14,871
- Yes, we're a team. - This is so unfair.

325
00:13:15,472 --> 00:13:16,740
Let's get off.

326
00:13:16,806 --> 00:13:17,807
It's not set yet.

327
00:13:17,807 --> 00:13:19,743
You guys might not get chosen.

328
00:13:20,243 --> 00:13:22,612
Hey, you might have to live in that truck forever!

329
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:24,214
They're allowed to steal people.

330
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:27,317
- Jae Suk might not choose you two. - You guys might not get chosen.

331
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:30,120
(It's the last team leader's turn to choose.)

332
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,455
- My gosh. - Let's go Jae Suk.

333
00:13:32,722 --> 00:13:33,857
This music is...

334
00:13:33,857 --> 00:13:35,759
(What's this old song?)

335
00:13:36,526 --> 00:13:38,428
(Dancing)

336
00:13:38,428 --> 00:13:39,963
Look at him dance.

337
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:45,402
(He dances like everyone used to in the past.)

338
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:47,971
That doesn't look cool at all.

339
00:13:48,505 --> 00:13:51,808
(Let's go back to the 90s.)

340
00:13:51,808 --> 00:13:53,543
- He dances well. - My goodness.

341
00:13:53,543 --> 00:13:55,712
- That's an old dance. - It's a very old dance.

342
00:13:55,712 --> 00:13:57,814
He's a great dancer.

343
00:13:57,814 --> 00:13:59,749
- He must've gone to a lot of clubs. - Look at him.

344
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:01,551
- It's this dance. - How does he do that?

345
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:03,353
How does he do this so well?

346
00:14:03,353 --> 00:14:05,155
(Everyone's attracted to Jae Suk.)

347
00:14:05,755 --> 00:14:07,257
How can he dance like this?

348
00:14:07,257 --> 00:14:08,324
(Jae Suk chooses Haha.)

349
00:14:08,324 --> 00:14:09,325
You got chosen?

350
00:14:09,325 --> 00:14:11,428
- Come on. - Jae Suk!

351
00:14:11,428 --> 00:14:14,531
(They dance as a couple.)

352
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:16,099
- My goodness. - Really?

353
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:19,035
- He's... - He must've danced a lot.

354
00:14:19,035 --> 00:14:21,504
(He chooses Ji Hyo as his second team member.)

355
00:14:21,504 --> 00:14:23,339
I'm sure he went to a lot of clubs.

356
00:14:23,673 --> 00:14:24,674
We're a team.

357
00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:27,110
They're all wearing jeans.

358
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,411
They look good together.

359
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:31,214
You really know how to dance.

360
00:14:31,314 --> 00:14:32,615
Look at him.

361
00:14:32,615 --> 00:14:34,084
You're a good dancer.

362
00:14:34,084 --> 00:14:35,218
(Everybody starts dancing like Jae Suk.)

363
00:14:35,218 --> 00:14:37,687
(All team leaders successfully chose their team members.)

364
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:39,556
Jae Suk.

365
00:14:39,556 --> 00:14:42,058
Jae Suk's really handsome, but he dances like Seok Jin.

366
00:14:42,525 --> 00:14:44,327
Whom are you talking about?

367
00:14:44,527 --> 00:14:45,795
The good-looking Jae Suk.

368
00:14:45,795 --> 00:14:46,830
(I'm talking about the good-looking Jae Suk.)

369
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,031
He's incredible.

370
00:14:48,031 --> 00:14:49,933
Are you all satisfied with your team members?

371
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:51,868
- I'm satisfied. - Me too.

372
00:14:51,868 --> 00:14:55,038
This is new. I'm just not so excited about getting ginseng.

373
00:14:55,038 --> 00:14:57,140
- Do we get to go abroad? - Yes.

374
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,408
- Wasn't that us? - We get the gold.

375
00:14:58,408 --> 00:14:59,609
Right, we get the gold.

376
00:14:59,609 --> 00:15:01,644
- Your prize is gold? - I like going abroad.

377
00:15:01,711 --> 00:15:03,446
I'll explain the overall rule.

378
00:15:03,446 --> 00:15:05,815
The team that wins each mission...

379
00:15:05,815 --> 00:15:09,285
will get a VIP ticket that will help them win the final race.

380
00:15:10,053 --> 00:15:11,754
The team that wins the final race...

381
00:15:11,754 --> 00:15:13,857
will be able to take the prize that was chosen by their leader.

382
00:15:14,224 --> 00:15:17,327
I've installed a water bomb over there.

383
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:19,195
(A water bomb?)

384
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:20,930
I've installed a water bomb.

385
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,365
- What? - But there's just one bomb.

386
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:25,368
- I see. - There's just one water bomb.

387
00:15:25,602 --> 00:15:27,971
There's just one. Now, please get changed into your team uniforms...

388
00:15:28,171 --> 00:15:30,507
- and gather back here. - Okay.

389
00:15:30,507 --> 00:15:31,541
Let's do this.

390
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,575
(What will be the result of this race?)

391
00:15:33,343 --> 00:15:34,644
(Booking Race)

392
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:37,080
(Now, let's begin the Booking Race.)

393
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,915
This is the first match.

394
00:15:39,415 --> 00:15:42,385
Round One is "Booking Quiz".

395
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:44,888
("Booking Quiz")

396
00:15:44,888 --> 00:15:46,256
- It's a quiz. - Yes.

397
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:48,925
All of you will play at the same time.

398
00:15:49,425 --> 00:15:53,930
The first sentence and the score will appear on the screen.

399
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,200
Ride the mini car all the way here.

400
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,936
Grab the phone and book the member to take the quiz.

401
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:04,407
If you want to take the quiz, say your name.

402
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:05,942
- Can we call someone else? - If it's too difficult,

403
00:16:05,942 --> 00:16:07,644
you can say someone else's name.

404
00:16:07,844 --> 00:16:10,079
The first team to score 100 points wins.

405
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:12,315
If you answer incorrectly,

406
00:16:12,482 --> 00:16:14,751
we'll throw flour at you.

407
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:15,785
(It's a flour bomb.)

408
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:18,454
There are two holes in my team.

409
00:16:18,454 --> 00:16:19,656
Haha doesn't know anything.

410
00:16:19,656 --> 00:16:21,157
- We have no hope... - It's a big tunnel.

411
00:16:21,157 --> 00:16:23,426
- for Haha. - Haha has no idea.

412
00:16:23,426 --> 00:16:26,863
We hope two holes are all we need, but let's see how Jae Suk does.

413
00:16:26,863 --> 00:16:28,598
- That's true. - You never know.

414
00:16:28,598 --> 00:16:30,233
You'll reach a limit.

415
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,902
(He chuckles nervously.)

416
00:16:33,603 --> 00:16:36,039
(We look forward to his performance.)

417
00:16:36,306 --> 00:16:37,840
(Booking Race)

418
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,009
Are you ready?

419
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:41,344
- Yes. - I was born ready.

420
00:16:41,811 --> 00:16:44,447
- What will be the question? - I depend on you, Kwang Soo.

421
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:45,648
- Shall we go? - Yes.

422
00:16:45,648 --> 00:16:46,716
What's going on?

423
00:16:47,116 --> 00:16:48,851
(The 1st question relates to Sandara for 20 points.)

424
00:16:48,851 --> 00:16:52,455
(As "Celebrity Siblings", Sandara and her brother work together.)

425
00:16:53,323 --> 00:16:55,158
(Everyone starts to race.)

426
00:16:55,158 --> 00:16:56,226
What's going on?

427
00:16:56,426 --> 00:16:58,661
(Sandara wants to answer the question.)

428
00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:01,698
What's going on? It's stuck.

429
00:17:01,798 --> 00:17:04,167
I was wondering why mine wasn't moving.

430
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:05,168
(Jong Kook can't start.)

431
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:09,839
(Sandara, Haha, and Ji Hyo race forward.)

432
00:17:10,506 --> 00:17:13,710
(They reach for the phone.)

433
00:17:15,178 --> 00:17:17,680
(Haha grabs the phone first.)

434
00:17:18,214 --> 00:17:20,316
Why couldn't I move faster?

435
00:17:20,316 --> 00:17:21,417
Whom will you book?

436
00:17:22,151 --> 00:17:23,653
- Whom will you book? - Haha.

437
00:17:23,653 --> 00:17:24,654
Haha?

438
00:17:24,654 --> 00:17:26,956
(Haha books himself.)

439
00:17:27,123 --> 00:17:29,592
- Will you answer it? - Everyone knows the answer.

440
00:17:29,592 --> 00:17:30,927
The answer is obvious.

441
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:32,862
The question is very easy. I know the answer.

442
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:35,398
- It's a difficult question for you. - I definitely know the answer.

443
00:17:35,398 --> 00:17:37,233
(Once he sits, the whole question is revealed.)

444
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:38,868
The question is difficult.

445
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:43,072
(The answer is too obvious.)

446
00:17:43,973 --> 00:17:46,509
(What's the name of Sandara's brother?)

447
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:48,745
- The answer is obvious. - Come on.

448
00:17:48,945 --> 00:17:51,047
(He knows the answer.)

449
00:17:51,047 --> 00:17:52,482
The answer is obvious.

450
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:53,516
It's too easy.

451
00:17:53,516 --> 00:17:55,418
- I know a lot about celebrities. - That's right.

452
00:17:55,418 --> 00:17:56,686
- What's the answer? - Byeo Rak.

453
00:17:56,853 --> 00:17:58,655
It's number three, Cheon Dung.

454
00:17:59,222 --> 00:18:02,158
(Haha earns 20 points.)

455
00:18:02,158 --> 00:18:03,926
Let's answer all of them.

456
00:18:03,926 --> 00:18:06,496
- Everyone knows the answer. - My legs hurt.

457
00:18:07,096 --> 00:18:08,398
Good job.

458
00:18:08,398 --> 00:18:09,699
I can answer anything about celebrities.

459
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:11,367
Gosh, we missed it.

460
00:18:11,434 --> 00:18:12,702
- Sandara. - Yes?

461
00:18:12,835 --> 00:18:15,405
It was about your brother. You should have answered it.

462
00:18:15,405 --> 00:18:16,539
I won't miss the next one.

463
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:17,907
Let's answer all questions about celebrities.

464
00:18:18,207 --> 00:18:19,509
Gosh, we missed it.

465
00:18:19,876 --> 00:18:21,411
Here's the second question.

466
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:23,246
(It's the second question.)

467
00:18:23,246 --> 00:18:24,714
- It's for 40 points. - Hey.

468
00:18:24,714 --> 00:18:26,983
(The 2nd question relates to Haha for 40 points.)

469
00:18:26,983 --> 00:18:28,318
He's so fast.

470
00:18:28,785 --> 00:18:31,587
(Everyone races forward to book.)

471
00:18:32,455 --> 00:18:35,058
(It's my question. Move out of the way.)

472
00:18:35,591 --> 00:18:37,360
- It's mine. - He's so fast.

473
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,228
(Bak grabs the phone.)

474
00:18:39,228 --> 00:18:41,097
- He's so fast. - Goodness.

475
00:18:41,164 --> 00:18:44,300
- You should answer it. - Let Jae Suk answer it.

476
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,171
(The question seems difficult.)

477
00:18:48,171 --> 00:18:50,139
(Will he answer it himself?)

478
00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:51,207
You answer it.

479
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:52,608
I'll answer it.

480
00:18:53,242 --> 00:18:55,178
- Okay. - You can do it.

481
00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:56,713
- You're smart. - I know the answer.

482
00:18:56,813 --> 00:18:58,581
The question is somewhat difficult.

483
00:18:59,182 --> 00:19:00,850
"When did the Berlin Wall..."

484
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,518
- What? - I don't know the answer.

485
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:04,220
Wait a minute.

486
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,621
It's too difficult.

487
00:19:06,122 --> 00:19:07,590
Was it 1990? I'm confused.

488
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,925
I don't know the answer.

489
00:19:08,925 --> 00:19:11,027
- Is it number one? - What's the answer?

490
00:19:11,027 --> 00:19:12,228
Is it 1988?

491
00:19:12,228 --> 00:19:13,830
- Take a guess. - Number three.

492
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,298
(He answers the year 1989.)

493
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:20,937
(He gets a question about history. Will Bak's answer be correct?)

494
00:19:20,937 --> 00:19:24,774
(Bak earns 40 points.)

495
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,609
(He's surprisingly smart.)

496
00:19:26,642 --> 00:19:28,444
He's so smart.

497
00:19:28,444 --> 00:19:29,912
You're very sexy.

498
00:19:30,113 --> 00:19:31,180
He's so cool.

499
00:19:31,481 --> 00:19:32,849
- He answered correctly. - How did you know?

500
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:34,617
Our score is zero.

501
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:39,655
The Berlin Wall was demolished in 1989.

502
00:19:40,323 --> 00:19:41,457
Here's the next question.

503
00:19:41,457 --> 00:19:42,925
(It's related to Han Jae Suk.)

504
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:44,227
What is it?

505
00:19:44,227 --> 00:19:45,928
(The 3rd question relates to Jae Suk for 50 points.)

506
00:19:45,928 --> 00:19:47,196
Come on.

507
00:19:47,597 --> 00:19:48,598
Good job.

508
00:19:49,265 --> 00:19:50,967
(He's in a daze.)

509
00:19:51,768 --> 00:19:52,802
What's this?

510
00:19:52,802 --> 00:19:54,170
(Is it Sol Mi?)

511
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:56,439
(Everyone moves forward.)

512
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:59,909
(One old man stays behind.)

513
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:05,415
(Young people are good at riding mini cars these days.)

514
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:09,419
(Sol Mi, being on variety shows isn't easy.)

515
00:20:09,952 --> 00:20:12,121
(I'm sorry, honey. I'm not good at this game.)

516
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:13,256
Goodness.

517
00:20:13,256 --> 00:20:15,591
(Right, you aren't very good.)

518
00:20:15,825 --> 00:20:16,959
Goodness.

519
00:20:17,326 --> 00:20:19,362
(Kwang Soo gets his chance to book.)

520
00:20:19,362 --> 00:20:20,530
Good job.

521
00:20:21,264 --> 00:20:23,499
I was too flustered to move.

522
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:26,836
This is too difficult. Book Sandara.

523
00:20:26,836 --> 00:20:28,070
It's difficult.

524
00:20:28,171 --> 00:20:29,972
(The score is too high.)

525
00:20:30,406 --> 00:20:33,109
(He suspects that he won't know the answer.)

526
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,144
- Sandara. - That's right.

527
00:20:35,144 --> 00:20:37,180
You can do it.

528
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,681
- You can guess. - She won't know.

529
00:20:38,681 --> 00:20:41,217
- You must answer correctly. - I didn't see the question.

530
00:20:41,217 --> 00:20:42,285
(What's the question?)

531
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:43,419
Read the question.

532
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:44,787
What?

533
00:20:45,021 --> 00:20:46,856
- I knew it'd be difficult. - What is it?

534
00:20:47,056 --> 00:20:49,425
Man Deok is known as a savior of this place.

535
00:20:49,425 --> 00:20:50,860
The question is too easy.

536
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:53,830
(She has no idea.)

537
00:20:54,197 --> 00:20:55,498
(Kwang Soo teases her.)

538
00:20:55,498 --> 00:20:56,566
Man Deok?

539
00:20:56,566 --> 00:20:58,468
- I'd be impressed. - Which place is it?

540
00:20:58,534 --> 00:20:59,735
Just take a guess.

541
00:20:59,735 --> 00:21:00,803
What's the answer?

542
00:21:00,803 --> 00:21:02,839
- It's a place he saved. - Wait, no.

543
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:03,940
Sandara.

544
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,142
- Answer it. - Take a guess.

545
00:21:06,209 --> 00:21:07,944
- Take a guess. - Number three, Ulleung Island.

546
00:21:07,944 --> 00:21:09,412
- Good job. - I think it's correct.

547
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,482
(Did Kwang Soo choose the right person?)

548
00:21:12,482 --> 00:21:13,616
Good job.

549
00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:15,585
- It's incorrect. - Gosh.

550
00:21:16,886 --> 00:21:18,955
(She gets a flour bomb.)

551
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:20,756
(It's shocking to look at.)

552
00:21:20,756 --> 00:21:22,258
- Gosh. - That's how it works.

553
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:23,826
Gosh.

554
00:21:24,227 --> 00:21:25,728
I had no idea.

555
00:21:26,295 --> 00:21:28,297
I didn't know this would happen. I'm sorry.

556
00:21:28,297 --> 00:21:29,532
Sandara.

557
00:21:29,532 --> 00:21:30,900
That was cruel.

558
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:33,503
I didn't know this would happen. I'm sorry.

559
00:21:33,503 --> 00:21:34,770
Sandara.

560
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,372
You look pretty right now.

561
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,574
(Sandara turns white.)

562
00:21:38,641 --> 00:21:39,942
She looks like a Japanese doll.

563
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,045
Jae Suk knew the answer.

564
00:21:44,146 --> 00:21:45,915
(Team Yoon Bak has the highest score.)

565
00:21:45,915 --> 00:21:47,884
(In the movie "Battlefield Heroes"...)

566
00:21:47,884 --> 00:21:50,920
(The 4th question relates to Kwang Soo for 30 points.)

567
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,988
No!

568
00:21:53,556 --> 00:21:54,624
(It seems difficult.)

569
00:21:54,624 --> 00:21:56,058
No! Hold on!

570
00:21:57,126 --> 00:21:59,195
(She doesn't care if the question is difficult.)

571
00:21:59,195 --> 00:22:00,496
- Come on, Kwang Soo. - Sandara.

572
00:22:01,264 --> 00:22:05,167
(Bak and Sandara arrive simultaneously.)

573
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:06,536
Sandara.

574
00:22:06,536 --> 00:22:08,437
(Reach for the phone.)

575
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:13,109
(Sandara gets her chance to book.)

576
00:22:13,109 --> 00:22:14,310
Stay calm.

577
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,546
- Bak moves so fast. - How is it possible?

578
00:22:16,546 --> 00:22:17,580
The person I'll book is...

579
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,581
(Whom will she book?)

580
00:22:19,248 --> 00:22:23,252
(Remember Jae Suk who stayed behind?)

581
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,155
- It's Jae Suk. - That's right.

582
00:22:26,155 --> 00:22:27,757
(Sandara books Jae Suk.)

583
00:22:27,757 --> 00:22:30,326
- You can do it. - He'll answer it.

584
00:22:30,326 --> 00:22:32,862
- Good job, Sandara. - Good job.

585
00:22:32,862 --> 00:22:34,530
(Kwang Soo hopes for a difficult question.)

586
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,631
- Good job. - Let's see.

587
00:22:35,631 --> 00:22:39,001
(Is this the flour bomb?)

588
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:40,870
- It's difficult. - Will he answer correctly?

589
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,371
Jae Suk, it's so easy.

590
00:22:42,371 --> 00:22:44,140
(It's a question about history.)

591
00:22:44,507 --> 00:22:46,042
- Is it a multiple-choice question? - Yes.

592
00:22:46,142 --> 00:22:47,209
It is.

593
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:49,512
(Jae Suk's fear starts to grow.)

594
00:22:49,512 --> 00:22:50,580
The Three Kingdoms of Korea.

595
00:22:51,047 --> 00:22:52,481
- What is it? - Joseon?

596
00:22:52,848 --> 00:22:54,517
It's the name of a kingdom.

597
00:22:54,884 --> 00:22:56,352
- Isn't it Silla? - What is it?

598
00:22:57,153 --> 00:22:58,387
It's the name of a kingdom.

599
00:22:58,387 --> 00:23:00,856
(What will be his answer?)

600
00:23:00,856 --> 00:23:01,958
It's Goguryeo.

601
00:23:02,858 --> 00:23:10,466
(Will Jae Suk's reputation change to a smart team leader?)

602
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:12,735
(Jae Suk earns 30 points.)

603
00:23:13,603 --> 00:23:15,738
(He's smart after all.)

604
00:23:15,738 --> 00:23:17,006
He's good.

605
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:19,275
Is it Goguryeo?

606
00:23:21,077 --> 00:23:22,979
This is what Kwang Soo said.

607
00:23:23,245 --> 00:23:26,782
He appeared in the movie and said that the answer was Silla.

608
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:28,317
- He said Silla. - No, I didn't.

609
00:23:28,684 --> 00:23:29,819
I was lying on purpose.

610
00:23:29,885 --> 00:23:31,387
Gosh, I'm relieved.

611
00:23:31,821 --> 00:23:33,122
Goodness.

612
00:23:33,122 --> 00:23:34,724
That was great.

613
00:23:35,257 --> 00:23:37,727
- Our team is the best. - We're amazing.

614
00:23:37,727 --> 00:23:40,196
Ji Hyo, you should go quickly and book.

615
00:23:40,296 --> 00:23:43,199
- I'll go and book. - Sandara is quick.

616
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:45,635
I hope no one calls my name anymore.

617
00:23:46,836 --> 00:23:48,337
Everyone, get ready.

618
00:23:48,337 --> 00:23:49,338
(Team Jae Suk takes the lead.)

619
00:23:49,538 --> 00:23:51,607
(Jae Suk played a lead in a drama called "Jazz".)

620
00:23:51,607 --> 00:23:53,943
(The 5th question relates to Jae Suk for 20 points.)

621
00:23:55,111 --> 00:23:58,247
(Jae Suk moves forward.)

622
00:23:58,247 --> 00:23:59,382
Why didn't you stop Ji Hyo?

623
00:23:59,382 --> 00:24:00,650
(There's heavy traffic.)

624
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,386
(He stops to look at the fight.)

625
00:24:05,621 --> 00:24:09,125
(Ji Hyo gets through the traffic and races forward.)

626
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:10,559
The person I'll book is...

627
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,827
Call out Jae Suk.

628
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:12,862
(They trust Jae Suk.)

629
00:24:13,062 --> 00:24:14,397
Call out Jae Suk.

630
00:24:14,397 --> 00:24:15,665
- Jae Suk. - Call him.

631
00:24:15,665 --> 00:24:16,932
(Ji Hyo books Jae Suk.)

632
00:24:17,066 --> 00:24:19,168
- Did someone stop you? - Yes.

633
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:21,437
Answering your own question incorrectly is funny.

634
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:23,873
Let's go, Jae Suk.

635
00:24:25,408 --> 00:24:27,343
- "He was born in 1900." - It's difficult.

636
00:24:27,343 --> 00:24:29,011
"He's called the father of jazz. Who is he?"

637
00:24:29,545 --> 00:24:33,249
(The question relates to jazz this time.)

638
00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:34,483
What is this?

639
00:24:34,984 --> 00:24:36,018
What?

640
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:38,387
(Why is the question so difficult?)

641
00:24:38,521 --> 00:24:39,655
What's the answer?

642
00:24:40,456 --> 00:24:41,957
Louis Armstrong.

643
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:45,561
(It's another difficult question.)

644
00:24:45,561 --> 00:24:47,596
(Will Jae Suk create a miracle?)

645
00:24:47,596 --> 00:24:48,731
It's a difficult one.

646
00:24:48,731 --> 00:24:50,766
(Jae Suk earns 20 points.)

647
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:54,537
(Who is that man?)

648
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:57,039
Jae Suk is good at quizzes.

649
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,140
(Call Jae Suk for quizzes.)

650
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,009
Jae Suk is amazing.

651
00:25:00,476 --> 00:25:03,145
- My goodness. - He's such a smart man.

652
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,715
- How did you know the answer? - He's so sexy.

653
00:25:06,148 --> 00:25:08,584
- Our team is the best, Ji Hyo. - I know.

654
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,320
Here's the next question.

655
00:25:11,854 --> 00:25:12,955
Is that it?

656
00:25:12,955 --> 00:25:14,156
(Seok Jin debuted as a singer in 1992.)

657
00:25:14,156 --> 00:25:17,827
(The 6th question relates to Seok Jin for 60 points.)

658
00:25:19,328 --> 00:25:22,431
(Bak races ahead the quickest.)

659
00:25:22,431 --> 00:25:24,366
Bak is so quick.

660
00:25:24,366 --> 00:25:25,501
Hello?

661
00:25:25,601 --> 00:25:27,169
- Call out Seok Jin. - Okay.

662
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:28,404
- Call me. - Hurry.

663
00:25:28,537 --> 00:25:29,972
- Seok Jin. - Okay!

664
00:25:30,806 --> 00:25:32,441
(Bak books Seok Jin.)

665
00:25:32,441 --> 00:25:34,343
I think he knows the answer.

666
00:25:34,343 --> 00:25:37,213
- It's a question about himself. - "I Know"?

667
00:25:37,213 --> 00:25:39,515
- I hope he gets it wrong. - It's about "I Know".

668
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,818
- What? - It's so hard.

669
00:25:42,818 --> 00:25:44,019
(Seok Jin debuted as a singer in 1992.)

670
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:46,255
(Which of the following words does not appear in "I Know"?)

671
00:25:46,255 --> 00:25:48,824
(Eyes, Lips, Breath, Happiness)

672
00:25:49,525 --> 00:25:50,826
(Worried)

673
00:25:50,826 --> 00:25:52,161
- What? - It's so hard.

674
00:25:52,228 --> 00:25:53,329
We're doomed.

675
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,431
(Exactly)

676
00:25:55,431 --> 00:25:56,732
- 5, 4, 3... - 4, 3...

677
00:25:56,732 --> 00:25:58,534
(It's going to be hilarious.)

678
00:25:58,534 --> 00:25:59,535
- I'll answer. - One.

679
00:25:59,535 --> 00:26:02,338
- 3, 2, 1. - I'll answer.

680
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:04,039
Number three, "happiness".

681
00:26:04,807 --> 00:26:07,076
(Will he be covered with flour?)

682
00:26:07,076 --> 00:26:11,914
(Or does he correctly remember his 26-year-old song?)

683
00:26:11,914 --> 00:26:13,482
(Team Yoon Bak wins 60 points.)

684
00:26:13,482 --> 00:26:15,117
It was correct.

685
00:26:15,251 --> 00:26:18,020
(I'm so proud of you.)

686
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,923
- You remember it. - I just took a guess.

687
00:26:21,857 --> 00:26:27,429
(Seok Jin's legendary debut song)

688
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,432
- I took a guess. - You remember your song.

689
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:33,402
Let's go, Bak.

690
00:26:33,435 --> 00:26:34,970
This question is worth 100 points.

691
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,372
(This question will determine the 2nd and 3rd places.)

692
00:26:37,473 --> 00:26:40,176
(The 7th question is about Yoon Bak and worth 100 points.)

693
00:26:40,176 --> 00:26:42,745
(Yoon Bak recently appeared in "The Law of Jungle".)

694
00:26:43,245 --> 00:26:45,481
- Hey! - Go away!

695
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:47,917
(It's a great chance for Team Sandara.)

696
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,252
- Mine doesn't move. - I know.

697
00:26:50,352 --> 00:26:52,254
(Relaxed)

698
00:26:53,255 --> 00:26:55,124
(They race as fast as they can.)

699
00:26:55,658 --> 00:26:58,227
(Ji Hyo gets the chance.)

700
00:26:58,227 --> 00:27:00,029
- Why is it... - Let's do this.

701
00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:02,631
I'll book Haha.

702
00:27:03,265 --> 00:27:05,034
I was telling you to do it yourself.

703
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:07,236
(You're booked anyway.)

704
00:27:07,236 --> 00:27:09,905
- Haha. - There should be minus points.

705
00:27:09,905 --> 00:27:11,440
(All right, here I come.)

706
00:27:12,107 --> 00:27:13,242
There should have been minus points.

707
00:27:13,242 --> 00:27:14,243
(It's fun to watch.)

708
00:27:14,844 --> 00:27:16,212
(Where did Bak visit for "The Law of Jungle"?)

709
00:27:16,212 --> 00:27:18,480
- What's that? - It's hard.

710
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,084
- It's too hard. - I should have done it.

711
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:26,055
- They went to the same place. - We went to the same place.

712
00:27:26,055 --> 00:27:29,825
I participated in the 1st half, and he the 2nd.

713
00:27:29,825 --> 00:27:31,627
- Let's continue. - What's your answer?

714
00:27:31,827 --> 00:27:33,829
Brazil.

715
00:27:33,829 --> 00:27:38,968
(Why are Jae Suk and Bak laughing?)

716
00:27:38,968 --> 00:27:40,202
(Wrong)

717
00:27:40,202 --> 00:27:41,837
This is frustrating.

718
00:27:42,905 --> 00:27:46,208
(Aren't there jungles in Brazil too?)

719
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:48,644
(The correct answer is New Caledonia.)

720
00:27:49,578 --> 00:27:56,318
(Both Bak and Jae Suk visited a jungle in New Caledonia.)

721
00:27:57,019 --> 00:27:58,954
(The 2nd place and the 3rd place compete again.)

722
00:27:58,954 --> 00:28:01,757
This will be the last question.

723
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:05,728
(The 8th question is about Sandara and worth 100 points.)

724
00:28:05,728 --> 00:28:07,930
- Ji Hyo, go! - Hurry.

725
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:12,368
(Make way for me.)

726
00:28:13,102 --> 00:28:15,704
(Which team will get the chance?)

727
00:28:15,804 --> 00:28:18,741
- Sandara, book Jong Kook. - You know, right?

728
00:28:18,741 --> 00:28:21,043
- I'll book... - Sandara, book Jong Kook.

729
00:28:21,043 --> 00:28:23,012
I'll book Jong Kook.

730
00:28:23,646 --> 00:28:25,014
There you go.

731
00:28:25,014 --> 00:28:26,916
(What's the question?)

732
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:30,252
(Which of the following has never hosted "Inkigayo"?)

733
00:28:30,252 --> 00:28:31,720
(Song Ji Hyo, Song Hye Kyo, Han Hyo Joo, Han Ye Seul)

734
00:28:32,354 --> 00:28:33,722
You have to get it right.

735
00:28:34,056 --> 00:28:35,424
- Please. - I'll answer.

736
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:39,295
(If he gets it right, Team Sandara will be second place.)

737
00:28:39,328 --> 00:28:41,430
- Let's take turns. - Why am I not sure?

738
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,799
I'm not sure either.

739
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:46,335
- Number two, "Song Hye Kyo". - It's confusing.

740
00:28:46,335 --> 00:28:48,203
- There you go. - That's wrong.

741
00:28:48,237 --> 00:28:52,241
(There's only one VIP ticket left now.)

742
00:28:52,241 --> 00:28:56,378
(Will Team Sandara win the VIP ticket?)

743
00:28:56,378 --> 00:28:58,247
(Team Sandara wins 2nd place.)

744
00:28:59,048 --> 00:29:00,182
(The booking turns out to be successful.)

745
00:29:00,182 --> 00:29:03,852
- It was correct. - He got it right.

746
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:07,256
(Song Ji Hyo)

747
00:29:07,256 --> 00:29:08,924
(Han Hyo Joo)

748
00:29:08,924 --> 00:29:11,026
(Han Ye Seul)

749
00:29:11,026 --> 00:29:14,730
(Song Hye Kyo was a reporter, not a host.)

750
00:29:16,498 --> 00:29:19,335
(Jae Suk's team finishes in 3rd place.)

751
00:29:19,335 --> 00:29:20,736
- We did it. - Gosh.

752
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:24,440
Team Yoon Bak wins two VIP tickets.

753
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,608
(Team Sandara wins one, and Team Jae Suk none.)

754
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:29,211
- For the second game, - Go ahead.

755
00:29:29,211 --> 00:29:32,748
we'll have "Talent Quiz".

756
00:29:33,082 --> 00:29:37,152
Three missions will be shown on the screen.

757
00:29:37,252 --> 00:29:41,056
Pick one person for each mission and move to the designated places.

758
00:29:41,357 --> 00:29:42,358
Okay.

759
00:29:42,624 --> 00:29:44,059
(The missions are revealed.)

760
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:45,627
"A mission for movie lovers"...

761
00:29:45,627 --> 00:29:47,029
(A mission for movie lovers)

762
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:48,263
(A mission for music lovers)

763
00:29:48,263 --> 00:29:49,431
(A mission for good guessers)

764
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:53,802
What if the guessing game is meant for unlucky people?

765
00:29:54,003 --> 00:29:56,105
I'll do it then.

766
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:58,807
- I'll just continue to be unlucky. - We'll have to try.

767
00:29:58,807 --> 00:30:01,577
Those three will do the music mission.

768
00:30:01,643 --> 00:30:04,380
Bak and Jong Kook will do the movie mission.

769
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,348
The four of you will do the guessing mission.

770
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:08,851
Except Ji Hyo, we're all unlucky.

771
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:10,953
- We're so unlucky. - If we're unlucky today too...

772
00:30:10,953 --> 00:30:13,355
- We're two. - Exactly.

773
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:14,356
(Booking Race)

774
00:30:14,923 --> 00:30:18,227
(The members for the guessing mission arrive at the place.)

775
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:20,462
- What's that? - They look like airbags.

776
00:30:20,462 --> 00:30:24,566
- Some of them must burst. - We might have to guess.

777
00:30:24,566 --> 00:30:27,836
- We have advantages. - It's going to be fun.

778
00:30:27,836 --> 00:30:30,806
There are 90 airbags here.

779
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,676
Seven of them burst when you touch them.

780
00:30:34,843 --> 00:30:37,746
- Seven of them. - I'm confident.

781
00:30:37,746 --> 00:30:40,849
- Ji Hyo... - My gut feeling is...

782
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:43,619
- usually right. - Don't be ridiculous.

783
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:44,853
(Don't be ridiculous.)

784
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,256
- No, it isn't. - That's nonsense.

785
00:30:47,256 --> 00:30:48,724
(Jae Seok doesn't seem to know.)

786
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:51,527
I'm confident. My gut feeling is usually right.

787
00:30:51,527 --> 00:30:54,430
I figured out what this game is about right away.

788
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,564
Are there seven?

789
00:30:56,131 --> 00:30:59,968
2 are on that side, and 5 are on this side.

790
00:30:59,968 --> 00:31:03,472
- Determine the order. - Rock-paper-scissors is boring.

791
00:31:03,472 --> 00:31:07,643
Let's squeeze each other's hands. The one who screams first loses.

792
00:31:07,643 --> 00:31:09,845
(It's not that important who goes first.)

793
00:31:09,845 --> 00:31:11,980
- Let's do that. - Start.

794
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,182
(They're addicted to games.)

795
00:31:16,385 --> 00:31:19,721
(When did it start? Maybe 7 years ago?)

796
00:31:19,721 --> 00:31:22,825
(They used to be ordinary people.)

797
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:27,162
(After 8 years on Running Man, they can't live without games.)

798
00:31:27,162 --> 00:31:30,332
(They need your love and care.)

799
00:31:30,332 --> 00:31:32,301
(Game addiction hotline)

800
00:31:33,469 --> 00:31:35,604
(Gosh)

801
00:31:36,538 --> 00:31:38,740
(Jae Seok will go last.)

802
00:31:40,008 --> 00:31:41,710
(Screaming)

803
00:31:41,844 --> 00:31:43,712
- He'll go last. - There are teeth marks.

804
00:31:45,547 --> 00:31:47,149
- It's 2 to 1 now. - It's 2 to 1.

805
00:31:47,149 --> 00:31:49,852
- We have no choice. - Ji Hyo, please win.

806
00:31:49,852 --> 00:31:51,086
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo versus Ji Hyo)

807
00:31:51,086 --> 00:31:52,855
(Although Ji Hyo is always lucky,)

808
00:31:52,855 --> 00:31:56,625
(we're two people.)

809
00:31:57,626 --> 00:31:58,660
Let's start.

810
00:31:59,128 --> 00:32:00,395
Hey, why are you...

811
00:32:00,963 --> 00:32:02,231
(Severe pain)

812
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:04,833
- Why do you attack me? - I'm sorry.

813
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:06,368
(Kwang Soo can't control his attacking instinct.)

814
00:32:06,368 --> 00:32:09,071
- Hey! - I'm really sorry.

815
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:10,906
It's over now.

816
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,908
- Why did you attack me? - I'm sorry.

817
00:32:12,908 --> 00:32:14,209
Look at the color of our t-shirts!

818
00:32:14,209 --> 00:32:18,480
- I attacked both sides. - Let's play another game.

819
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,717
We hit each other's forehead, and the one who falls backward loses.

820
00:32:21,717 --> 00:32:24,186
- Okay. - If Ji Hyo falls and I stay...

821
00:32:24,186 --> 00:32:27,356
- Okay. - Stay where you are.

822
00:32:27,356 --> 00:32:30,526
- Don't fall. - You have to sit like this.

823
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:32,127
I won't fall.

824
00:32:32,794 --> 00:32:34,062
1, 2, 3.

825
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:37,900
Three.

826
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,034
(The sound is very cheerful.)

827
00:32:40,102 --> 00:32:44,173
(Kwang Soo's forehead is so nice to hit.)

828
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:47,042
- It's Ji Hyo's turn. - Come here.

829
00:32:47,075 --> 00:32:50,479
Kwang Soo will have to choose Seok Jin.

830
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:52,981
Ji Hyo, I have no choice.

831
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:55,484
- Did you wash your hands? - I couldn't help but fall.

832
00:32:55,484 --> 00:32:57,352
(It's so funny.)

833
00:32:57,352 --> 00:32:59,555
- "Did you wash your hands?" - 1, 2, 3.

834
00:33:02,157 --> 00:33:03,325
(Ji Hyo falls.)

835
00:33:04,326 --> 00:33:06,328
(Bye, Ji Hyo.)

836
00:33:08,063 --> 00:33:09,431
(There's no winner.)

837
00:33:09,431 --> 00:33:10,632
It's a tie.

838
00:33:10,632 --> 00:33:13,168
- Ji Hyo. - Let's do something else.

839
00:33:13,168 --> 00:33:15,170
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's do that.

840
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,406
We could have done it from the beginning.

841
00:33:17,739 --> 00:33:19,007
Rock-paper-scissors.

842
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:20,976
(Ji Hyo wins.)

843
00:33:21,843 --> 00:33:23,078
What a disappointment.

844
00:33:23,178 --> 00:33:25,847
We could have done this from the beginning.

845
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:27,449
We should have done that.

846
00:33:27,449 --> 00:33:28,984
(While they are deciding the order...)

847
00:33:29,484 --> 00:33:32,020
For the music-lovers,

848
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,823
- we prepared a music game. - I like it.

849
00:33:35,123 --> 00:33:39,461
The sticks move up and down according to your moves.

850
00:33:39,461 --> 00:33:42,231
Some sticks have a letter on them.

851
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:46,201
You'll have to come up with song titles by combining those letters.

852
00:33:46,201 --> 00:33:47,970
(The one who finds 2 song titles 1st wins.)

853
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,740
After ringing the bell and saying your answer,

854
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,143
sing one phrase of the song.

855
00:33:56,144 --> 00:33:57,412
I'm at the wrong place.

856
00:33:59,481 --> 00:34:01,216
(The music game starts.)

857
00:34:02,017 --> 00:34:04,253
- Is this the place? - Wait.

858
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:06,955
It's moving.

859
00:34:07,723 --> 00:34:09,258
(As Sandara dances,)

860
00:34:09,258 --> 00:34:10,425
(the sticks start to move.)

861
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:12,127
I see "come".

862
00:34:12,127 --> 00:34:13,195
(The sticks are dancing.)

863
00:34:13,195 --> 00:34:16,164
- We have to find song titles. - I see something.

864
00:34:16,164 --> 00:34:17,699
(They're surprised at the speed.)

865
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:20,235
I don't see any.

866
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:23,438
- It's hard. - Did you see "new"?

867
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:25,941
There must be something.

868
00:34:26,742 --> 00:34:28,710
(The sticks are teasing Sandara.)

869
00:34:31,913 --> 00:34:33,749
(Sandara saw "love".)

870
00:34:34,249 --> 00:34:35,751
(She runs to the microphone.)

871
00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:39,087
"Love Rain" by Kim Tae Woo.

872
00:34:39,554 --> 00:34:41,657
- Sing a phrase. - I don't know that song well.

873
00:34:41,657 --> 00:34:44,726
(She has to sing a phrase to win one point.)

874
00:34:44,726 --> 00:34:48,530
(Will she sing it right?)

875
00:34:48,597 --> 00:34:49,665
My goodness.

876
00:34:49,665 --> 00:34:53,802
Love rain falls

877
00:34:53,835 --> 00:34:56,004
When it falls

878
00:34:56,004 --> 00:34:57,005
(Wrong)

879
00:34:57,272 --> 00:34:59,441
- Why? - I'll give you one more chance.

880
00:34:59,441 --> 00:35:01,310
I don't know the lyrics.

881
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:03,178
- What's happening? - Go away.

882
00:35:03,178 --> 00:35:04,179
(I smell something.)

883
00:35:04,746 --> 00:35:08,750
When my love falls on me

884
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,321
- The love comes back - Okay.

885
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:14,256
(Thanks for the information.)

886
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:17,826
- Gosh, the lyrics. - "Love Rain" by Kim Tae Woo.

887
00:35:19,528 --> 00:35:20,896
(When your love falls on my eyes)

888
00:35:20,896 --> 00:35:24,032
When your love

889
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,101
(Wrong)

890
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:28,637
(Doesn't it count?)

891
00:35:28,637 --> 00:35:30,072
(That's a relief.)

892
00:35:30,706 --> 00:35:32,641
(Jae Suk gives a try.)

893
00:35:32,641 --> 00:35:35,377
- "Come Back to Busan Port". - By who?

894
00:35:35,377 --> 00:35:37,446
- Cho Yong Pil. - Sing a phrase now.

895
00:35:38,246 --> 00:35:42,317
(Jae Suk managed to find a long title.)

896
00:35:42,317 --> 00:35:44,820
(With this momentum, will he be able to succeed at once?)

897
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,954
Please sing the phrase.

898
00:35:46,555 --> 00:35:49,558
Flowers are blooming

899
00:35:49,825 --> 00:35:52,894
On Dongbaek Island

900
00:35:53,295 --> 00:35:56,765
Spring has come

901
00:35:56,765 --> 00:35:58,066
All right!

902
00:35:58,066 --> 00:35:59,801
(Jae Suk is the first one to succeed.)

903
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:00,969
Great. I got another one.

904
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,738
It's "Tatata" by Kim Guk Hwan.

905
00:36:02,738 --> 00:36:04,072
(Haha tries to sing "Tatata".)

906
00:36:04,072 --> 00:36:05,741
What a choice. All right.

907
00:36:06,308 --> 00:36:09,678
(This impressive song has gemlike lyrics and is sung with laughter.)

908
00:36:09,678 --> 00:36:12,347
(How will I know you?)

909
00:36:12,347 --> 00:36:20,922
(Laughing)

910
00:36:21,656 --> 00:36:23,024
- I only have sing one line, right? - Right.

911
00:36:24,126 --> 00:36:25,927
(Laughing)

912
00:36:26,161 --> 00:36:27,696
(Laughing)

913
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:29,064
Why?

914
00:36:29,064 --> 00:36:31,333
- Did you start? - He laughs for eight measures.

915
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:32,701
You can't do this.

916
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:34,369
This is in the lyrics.

917
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:36,738
That is not how he laughs in the song.

918
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:37,906
Fine.

919
00:36:38,173 --> 00:36:39,608
I'll sing "Tatata" by Kim Guk Hwan.

920
00:36:39,941 --> 00:36:41,009
(Laughing)

921
00:36:41,009 --> 00:36:42,644
(That's incorrect.)

922
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:45,747
That's not it.

923
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:47,449
(He laughs again, but he gets it wrong.)

924
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:50,252
Hey. Let me see. Give it to me.

925
00:36:50,485 --> 00:36:52,487
You might have the wrong lyrics.

926
00:36:53,155 --> 00:36:54,523
This is so frustrating.

927
00:36:54,556 --> 00:36:56,425
I can't get it right even if I know the song.

928
00:36:56,525 --> 00:36:57,859
(He falls into a trap of the song.)

929
00:36:58,994 --> 00:37:00,429
This is for movie lovers.

930
00:37:01,196 --> 00:37:02,864
During the film,

931
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:04,332
you will hear the keyword...

932
00:37:04,332 --> 00:37:07,135
and guess the title that starts with the keyword.

933
00:37:07,135 --> 00:37:08,236
- All right. - Okay.

934
00:37:08,236 --> 00:37:10,505
I'm scared of rides since I can't ride them well.

935
00:37:10,906 --> 00:37:13,241
All right. Let's do this for the VIP ticket.

936
00:37:13,408 --> 00:37:15,110
(Surprised)

937
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,045
(He's starting to be overly dramatic.)

938
00:37:17,345 --> 00:37:18,647
Was this a mistake to choose this?

939
00:37:18,647 --> 00:37:20,715
I don't know a lot about movies.

940
00:37:20,715 --> 00:37:22,551
(However, the quiz has already started.)

941
00:37:23,919 --> 00:37:26,655
(From the start, it's already bumpy ride.)

942
00:37:26,655 --> 00:37:27,656
This is amazing.

943
00:37:27,656 --> 00:37:28,924
(He clutches tightly.)

944
00:37:28,924 --> 00:37:29,925
(Fear versus curiosity)

945
00:37:29,925 --> 00:37:31,860
(Their reactions are polar opposites.)

946
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,528
I'm in trouble.

947
00:37:34,162 --> 00:37:36,465
(Get ready for 4D Racing!)

948
00:37:36,465 --> 00:37:37,833
- We are... - Goodness.

949
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:39,301
- I'm getting dizzy. - The first keyword is...

950
00:37:39,434 --> 00:37:40,535
"public".

951
00:37:40,735 --> 00:37:43,071
- I have the answer! - Jong Kook.

952
00:37:43,071 --> 00:37:44,139
The answer is "Public Enemy".

953
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:45,474
That's correct.

954
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:46,775
What am I going to do?

955
00:37:46,908 --> 00:37:48,844
- Hey. Look at that. - It's starting now.

956
00:37:48,844 --> 00:37:50,145
It's ready. Here we go.

957
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:51,146
(The race starts now!)

958
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:53,748
The second keyword is "north".

959
00:37:53,915 --> 00:37:55,851
- Jong Kook! - Yes, Jong Kook?

960
00:37:55,917 --> 00:37:57,385
- "North Korean Guys". - That's correct.

961
00:37:57,385 --> 00:37:58,386
Okay!

962
00:37:58,386 --> 00:38:00,155
(Jong Kook gets the second question too.)

963
00:38:00,522 --> 00:38:02,057
(He's in despair.)

964
00:38:02,057 --> 00:38:03,058
I have the answer.

965
00:38:03,058 --> 00:38:04,226
It's "Asura".

966
00:38:04,726 --> 00:38:06,328
- Correct! It's the last question. - All right.

967
00:38:06,394 --> 00:38:07,629
- Here's the keyword. - Jong Kook!

968
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:09,297
It's "The Harmonium in My Memory".

969
00:38:10,131 --> 00:38:11,433
- That's correct. - Okay.

970
00:38:11,433 --> 00:38:12,734
(Jong Kook wins the match.)

971
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:14,102
(He ends up only watching the films.)

972
00:38:14,102 --> 00:38:15,337
That's correct.

973
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:17,672
(Bak is a true fan of films.)

974
00:38:19,207 --> 00:38:20,475
How can you guess them right away?

975
00:38:20,475 --> 00:38:22,277
There are so many film titles.

976
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:24,479
- I can't believe him. - By the way...

977
00:38:24,646 --> 00:38:25,914
This isn't a set up, right?

978
00:38:26,147 --> 00:38:27,949
When he gave you the keyword, you knew right away.

979
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:30,385
- How can you be so fast? - Of course I can.

980
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:32,420
There are so many movie titles.

981
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,456
(I can't compete against Jong Kook.)

982
00:38:34,856 --> 00:38:36,057
Is this it?

983
00:38:36,258 --> 00:38:37,659
- Did I lose? - This is fun.

984
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:39,327
- Ji Hyo. Go first. - You should go first.

985
00:38:39,327 --> 00:38:40,862
- Ji Hyo. You can start. - Me?

986
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:43,098
- I'm nervous. - Goodness. This is...

987
00:38:43,231 --> 00:38:45,033
- By the way, - I'll show you I have a hunch too.

988
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:46,468
Having a good hunch and being lucky are two different things.

989
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:49,070
- I will show you that! - I'm more serious than ever.

990
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,205
Me too. I'm serious too.

991
00:38:50,272 --> 00:38:52,440
Only 7 will pop out of 90.

992
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,475
(Ji Hyo starts first.)

993
00:38:53,475 --> 00:38:56,578
(Ji Hyo is known to be the lucky one among the members.)

994
00:38:56,578 --> 00:39:00,081
(These unlucky ones are hoping that she will fail.)

995
00:39:03,084 --> 00:39:04,686
- All right. - What a surprise.

996
00:39:04,686 --> 00:39:06,221
(Did the airbag pop?)

997
00:39:07,322 --> 00:39:08,723
(The universe has taken their side.)

998
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:10,125
- You are out. - Okay.

999
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:11,626
(This is gratifying indeed!)

1000
00:39:11,626 --> 00:39:12,861
All right. Ji Hyo, you are out.

1001
00:39:13,295 --> 00:39:14,596
You are done, Ji Hyo.

1002
00:39:14,596 --> 00:39:16,031
- It's your turn, Kwang Soo. - Okay.

1003
00:39:16,364 --> 00:39:17,799
I don't want to lose to you two.

1004
00:39:17,799 --> 00:39:19,834
- It's Kwang Soo's turn. - I don't want to lose to you!

1005
00:39:19,834 --> 00:39:21,002
- I want to win too. - Okay!

1006
00:39:21,002 --> 00:39:22,337
- I'll chose this one. - All right.

1007
00:39:23,338 --> 00:39:26,207
(Ji Hyo couldn't avoid picking the false airbag.)

1008
00:39:26,207 --> 00:39:29,477
(Will Kwang Soo get lucky?)

1009
00:39:29,477 --> 00:39:30,679
- Okay! - You did it!

1010
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:32,347
(He succeeds.)

1011
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:35,150
- It's your turn, Seok Jin. - Okay.

1012
00:39:36,284 --> 00:39:37,519
I'll choose the one below Kwang Soo's.

1013
00:39:38,853 --> 00:39:41,856
(Can he succeed too after receiving Kwang Soo's lucky energy?)

1014
00:39:41,856 --> 00:39:43,158
- Okay! - You did it!

1015
00:39:43,158 --> 00:39:44,359
(Seok Jin succeeds too.)

1016
00:39:45,994 --> 00:39:47,562
I can't let those two win.

1017
00:39:48,663 --> 00:39:50,432
Probability-wise, we have the upper hand.

1018
00:39:51,499 --> 00:39:54,436
(It's a rare scene where these two unlucky ones are feeling confident.)

1019
00:39:54,536 --> 00:39:56,371
- All right! I'm pushing. - You chose one.

1020
00:39:56,371 --> 00:39:59,074
(If Jae Seok fails, Team Yoon Bak wins.)

1021
00:39:59,074 --> 00:40:01,109
- All right! I'm pushing. - You chose one.

1022
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:03,345
(The airbag deflates.)

1023
00:40:03,478 --> 00:40:04,579
(There was no twist.)

1024
00:40:04,846 --> 00:40:07,082
(Jae Seok fails.)

1025
00:40:07,082 --> 00:40:09,484
(Okay! The victory is ours!)

1026
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:11,319
- The victory goes to... - To us, right?

1027
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:12,754
Team Yoon Bak.

1028
00:40:12,754 --> 00:40:13,955
(They acquire one VIP ticket.)

1029
00:40:13,955 --> 00:40:15,657
- Cross! - Cross!

1030
00:40:16,224 --> 00:40:17,559
It was a close one.

1031
00:40:17,759 --> 00:40:19,327
Right. It was a close one.

1032
00:40:19,628 --> 00:40:21,329
- We're doing well today. - It's our day today.

1033
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:23,298
- I have a good feeling about this. - I find this amazing.

1034
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:24,499
We have to win today.

1035
00:40:26,134 --> 00:40:28,737
This is driving me crazy. How can't I know the lyrics?

1036
00:40:29,037 --> 00:40:30,739
I don't know who I am

1037
00:40:31,973 --> 00:40:34,576
There's no way that I am wrong.

1038
00:40:35,243 --> 00:40:37,545
That was one of my favorite songs, but I can't recall the lyrics now.

1039
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,716
I'll sing "Tatata" by Kim Guk Hwan.

1040
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:44,819
If you don't know who I am

1041
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,022
How will you know who I am?

1042
00:40:47,022 --> 00:40:48,556
(He is just flat out wrong.)

1043
00:40:48,923 --> 00:40:50,992
(He begins to talk nonsense.)

1044
00:40:50,992 --> 00:40:52,927
(He is confused who doesn't know whom.)

1045
00:40:52,927 --> 00:40:55,230
(It has to be right this time.)

1046
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,165
How will you know me?

1047
00:40:57,165 --> 00:40:59,067
I won't do this anymore.

1048
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:00,535
Gosh!

1049
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:05,373
(Meanwhile, Sandara is struggling to fight off Jae Suk and Haha.)

1050
00:41:05,373 --> 00:41:07,609
(I just need to sing one more song right.)

1051
00:41:08,043 --> 00:41:11,046
(She's on the brink as she tries to sing a song.)

1052
00:41:11,546 --> 00:41:12,947
I'll sing "Eyes, Nose, Lips" by Tae Yang.

1053
00:41:13,081 --> 00:41:14,115
Please sing one line.

1054
00:41:14,449 --> 00:41:18,319
(She tries to keep up with them with Tae Yang's song.)

1055
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:19,821
(They share the same agency. She won't be wrong, right?)

1056
00:41:19,821 --> 00:41:20,955
Please sing one line.

1057
00:41:21,156 --> 00:41:23,858
(She's confident)

1058
00:41:23,858 --> 00:41:26,361
(She even dances confidently.)

1059
00:41:26,361 --> 00:41:29,564
Even all of your small nails

1060
00:41:30,031 --> 00:41:32,033
(She easily succeeds.)

1061
00:41:32,033 --> 00:41:34,736
- That's correct. Sandara. - Yes! This is great.

1062
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:37,939
Can I use the same word twice?

1063
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:40,742
- Yes, you can. - I can use the same word again?

1064
00:41:41,209 --> 00:41:42,577
I think that will work, Jae Suk.

1065
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:44,079
Will it work? I ought to ask.

1066
00:41:45,346 --> 00:41:46,681
(He's not certain.)

1067
00:41:46,848 --> 00:41:48,950
I came here to ask a question.

1068
00:41:49,884 --> 00:41:51,386
Can I use one character twice?

1069
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,555
It doesn't matter if you do.

1070
00:41:53,922 --> 00:41:55,156
I will sing "Strangers" by Choi Sung Soo.

1071
00:41:56,224 --> 00:41:58,026
- Can I sing that? - Please sing the song.

1072
00:41:58,026 --> 00:42:02,430
(He succeeds in differentiating his strategy by guessing an old song.)

1073
00:42:03,098 --> 00:42:04,866
(Will he...)

1074
00:42:04,866 --> 00:42:07,168
(be able to head straight to the victory?)

1075
00:42:07,168 --> 00:42:09,137
- Can I sing that? - Please sing the song.

1076
00:42:09,137 --> 00:42:11,139
(Thinking)

1077
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,576
(No way. He can't succeed.)

1078
00:42:15,777 --> 00:42:19,180
I have loved her wholeheartedly

1079
00:42:19,347 --> 00:42:22,117
She left my side tonight

1080
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:26,287
(If he sings the song correctly, Team Jae Suk will win.)

1081
00:42:26,488 --> 00:42:29,758
She left my side tonight

1082
00:42:31,626 --> 00:42:32,994
Tonight

1083
00:42:33,328 --> 00:42:34,796
(They win the game by guessing two songs correctly.)

1084
00:42:34,796 --> 00:42:36,931
What is it? Which song did you sing?

1085
00:42:37,065 --> 00:42:39,100
- I sang "Strangers". - Really?

1086
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,970
It's great to play this game with someone with an old soul.

1087
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,271
- This isn't over, Jae Suk. - Is it over?

1088
00:42:43,271 --> 00:42:44,606
- It is over now. - Oh, is it?

1089
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:46,074
- It's over. - Okay.

1090
00:42:46,074 --> 00:42:47,175
(Team Jae Suk acquires one VIP ticket.)

1091
00:42:47,275 --> 00:42:48,810
Why don't you laugh in the front?

1092
00:42:50,645 --> 00:42:52,380
(Laughing)

1093
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,815
You are the best.

1094
00:42:53,815 --> 00:42:55,316
(The score is 1 to 1 to 1.)

1095
00:42:55,917 --> 00:42:57,285
Now, it's time for a meal.

1096
00:42:57,285 --> 00:42:58,553
- Really? - Goodness.

1097
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,155
This looks delicious.

1098
00:43:00,155 --> 00:43:01,856
- Can we eat? - Yes, you can.

1099
00:43:01,856 --> 00:43:03,358
You can eat now.

1100
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:04,492
Thank you for the food.

1101
00:43:04,492 --> 00:43:06,661
- The steak looks delicious. - It looks tasty.

1102
00:43:07,495 --> 00:43:09,264
- Isn't the spaghetti delicious? - It is.

1103
00:43:09,264 --> 00:43:10,732
(Eating)

1104
00:43:11,132 --> 00:43:12,600
The food here is amazing.

1105
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,836
- It's really good. - The food here is delicious indeed.

1106
00:43:14,836 --> 00:43:17,005
(The best quality food pleases their palate and eyes.)

1107
00:43:17,472 --> 00:43:18,540
This is delicious.

1108
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,409
Listen up while you enjoy your food. We have one last final mission.

1109
00:43:21,409 --> 00:43:22,477
- Really? - Already?

1110
00:43:22,477 --> 00:43:24,379
We have one last final mission.

1111
00:43:24,379 --> 00:43:25,980
(We will do our last final mission already?)

1112
00:43:26,281 --> 00:43:27,515
We have one last final mission.

1113
00:43:28,016 --> 00:43:29,717
In the final race,

1114
00:43:29,918 --> 00:43:32,487
each team will do a different mission which will be determined...

1115
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:33,655
by the prize each team leader chose.

1116
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:34,989
- Goodness. - How are the missions different?

1117
00:43:35,056 --> 00:43:37,225
The missions are related to the selected prize.

1118
00:43:37,225 --> 00:43:38,560
(What kind of race will they face?)

1119
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,094
(The fate of the final race has already been chosen.)

1120
00:43:40,328 --> 00:43:41,496
Bak. Calm down.

1121
00:43:41,496 --> 00:43:42,564
Goodness.

1122
00:43:42,564 --> 00:43:44,132
- I got too excited. - Bak.

1123
00:43:44,132 --> 00:43:46,067
(Find, run, and solve if you want to change your fate.)

1124
00:43:46,401 --> 00:43:47,535
Where is he?

1125
00:43:47,535 --> 00:43:49,003
- He's right there! - Open it!

1126
00:43:49,003 --> 00:43:50,905
(Part 2 of Running Man is coming up next.)

1127
00:43:52,574 --> 00:43:56,144
(End of Running Man Part 1)

1128
00:43:56,644 --> 00:43:58,313
- Here is your final mission. - All right.

1129
00:43:58,646 --> 00:44:00,081
Missions are all different?

1130
00:44:01,082 --> 00:44:04,052
- What is that? - That's the passport.

1131
00:44:04,052 --> 00:44:05,486
(They are given luggage and passports.)

1132
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,189
(Sandara has chosen the Trip Abroad Gift.)

1133
00:44:08,189 --> 00:44:10,525
- I like traveling overseas. - I want to win it too.

1134
00:44:10,525 --> 00:44:11,993
I will explain the mission.

1135
00:44:12,627 --> 00:44:14,195
The mission which will allow...

1136
00:44:14,195 --> 00:44:16,664
you to win the Trip Abroad Gift is...

1137
00:44:17,065 --> 00:44:20,034
- "Pass Through Immigration". - What?

1138
00:44:20,034 --> 00:44:21,769
(Did he say we have to pass through immigration?)

1139
00:44:21,769 --> 00:44:22,904
Immigration?

1140
00:44:22,904 --> 00:44:24,539
In this building,

1141
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:27,642
six different nations' immigration checkpoints are hidden.

1142
00:44:27,642 --> 00:44:28,943
(They are all over the building.)

1143
00:44:28,943 --> 00:44:30,645
Find the immigration checkpoints.

1144
00:44:30,645 --> 00:44:34,616
Pass through immigration and get six stamps to succeed.

1145
00:44:35,149 --> 00:44:37,619
This is great. We can use the books to answer questions.

1146
00:44:38,286 --> 00:44:42,790
Here's the mission to win the prize of your choice, Ginseng Set.

1147
00:44:43,124 --> 00:44:44,626
It's called "Find the Supercar".

1148
00:44:44,993 --> 00:44:48,496
Here's the hint related to how you can find it.

1149
00:44:48,696 --> 00:44:53,468
Starting with the first hint, find the additional five hints.

1150
00:44:53,468 --> 00:44:55,470
Locate the Supercar accordingly.

1151
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:57,305
Jae Suk is great at quizzes.

1152
00:44:57,305 --> 00:44:58,840
I'm not good at finding.

1153
00:44:58,873 --> 00:45:00,675
Ji Hyo is amazing at finding things.

1154
00:45:00,942 --> 00:45:03,077
- Is it best to find it quickly? - Yes.

1155
00:45:04,879 --> 00:45:06,180
What will be the mission?

1156
00:45:06,714 --> 00:45:09,150
Which prize have you won recently on Running Man?

1157
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,285
I can't remember.

1158
00:45:10,785 --> 00:45:11,886
Today will be the day.

1159
00:45:12,287 --> 00:45:13,855
- Today is our day. - Right.

1160
00:45:13,955 --> 00:45:15,023
I'm being serious.

1161
00:45:15,023 --> 00:45:16,491
Here's your mission.

1162
00:45:16,491 --> 00:45:17,625
I'm curious.

1163
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:19,394
Here's your mission.

1164
00:45:19,827 --> 00:45:21,829
(Team Yoon Bak is determined.)

1165
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:23,965
(What will be their final mission?)

1166
00:45:23,965 --> 00:45:25,033
It's "Name Tag Elimination".

1167
00:45:25,033 --> 00:45:26,167
(It's "Name Tag Elimination".)

1168
00:45:26,167 --> 00:45:27,302
Is that it?

1169
00:45:27,402 --> 00:45:30,171
("Name Tag Elimination"?)

1170
00:45:30,171 --> 00:45:33,074
(We get to eliminate name tags.)

1171
00:45:35,143 --> 00:45:37,645
(Let's eliminate all the name tags today.)

1172
00:45:39,113 --> 00:45:43,451
(The other members are history.)

1173
00:45:43,451 --> 00:45:46,788
(They jump around in happiness.)

1174
00:45:46,788 --> 00:45:48,222
I'm so excited.

1175
00:45:48,723 --> 00:45:49,824
Wait.

1176
00:45:49,824 --> 00:45:51,893
I haven't felt so excited in a long time.

1177
00:45:51,893 --> 00:45:52,994
I'm excited.

1178
00:45:53,094 --> 00:45:54,395
What about out VIP ticket?

1179
00:45:55,063 --> 00:45:57,665
The number of VIP tickets determines the number...

1180
00:45:57,665 --> 00:45:59,968
of immigrations you don't have to pass through.

1181
00:46:00,401 --> 00:46:03,604
Team Sandara earned two VIP tickets.

1182
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:06,274
You only need to get four stamps.

1183
00:46:07,342 --> 00:46:10,578
I'll tell you where the first hint is hidden.

1184
00:46:10,578 --> 00:46:11,980
That's for one VIP ticket.

1185
00:46:12,046 --> 00:46:13,915
- There were many cars downstairs. - Right.

1186
00:46:13,982 --> 00:46:17,618
- The first hint is in the blue one. - I see.

1187
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,123
Each VIP ticket shows the location of the members.

1188
00:46:22,123 --> 00:46:24,025
(VIP tickets provide locations.)

1189
00:46:24,025 --> 00:46:26,427
If you have two VIP tickets, you get a Clone Card.

1190
00:46:26,427 --> 00:46:27,528
What should we do?

1191
00:46:27,528 --> 00:46:30,231
Let's use one for location. Then get Clone Card.

1192
00:46:30,231 --> 00:46:32,066
- We can eliminate one team. - Right.

1193
00:46:32,066 --> 00:46:33,601
- That's better. - What should we do?

1194
00:46:33,668 --> 00:46:36,671
There are only two clones for the Clone Card.

1195
00:46:38,106 --> 00:46:40,074
We need at least eight of them to fight Jong Kook.

1196
00:46:41,542 --> 00:46:43,044
(Try me if you can.)

1197
00:46:44,145 --> 00:46:45,380
For three VIP tickets...

1198
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,881
(For three VIP tickets...)

1199
00:46:46,881 --> 00:46:51,786
(They receive a tremendous benefit with three VIP tickets.)

1200
00:46:51,786 --> 00:46:52,954
Here you go.

1201
00:46:55,623 --> 00:46:58,192
(3 VIP tickets cause a ripple effect.)

1202
00:46:58,192 --> 00:47:00,695
(Bak's fast and furious chase starts.)

1203
00:47:00,895 --> 00:47:05,500
(How will the others handle the power of three VIP tickets?)

1204
00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:08,269
Let's jump around.

1205
00:47:08,269 --> 00:47:10,571
We finally get our chance today.

1206
00:47:10,571 --> 00:47:12,073
- What should we do? - Listen.

1207
00:47:12,073 --> 00:47:14,475
We must eliminate Jong Kook before the rumor spreads.

1208
00:47:14,475 --> 00:47:16,744
Once Jong Kook is eliminated,

1209
00:47:16,978 --> 00:47:18,946
everyone else will get scared.

1210
00:47:18,946 --> 00:47:20,415
It won't be so easy.

1211
00:47:21,516 --> 00:47:22,650
I understand.

1212
00:47:23,084 --> 00:47:24,652
Let's search the trunk first.

1213
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:26,921
- Open it. - Let's search.

1214
00:47:27,255 --> 00:47:30,625
Things are usually hidden here in Hollywood movies.

1215
00:47:30,825 --> 00:47:33,194
It was hidden here in "The Terminator".

1216
00:47:33,594 --> 00:47:34,896
- Ta-da. - No way.

1217
00:47:35,997 --> 00:47:37,632
I already knew it.

1218
00:47:37,732 --> 00:47:39,267
I sensed it right away.

1219
00:47:39,267 --> 00:47:40,802
I knew where it was hidden.

1220
00:47:41,135 --> 00:47:42,937
- Gosh, Haha. - We're so good.

1221
00:47:42,937 --> 00:47:45,840
- You're so observant. - We're a great team.

1222
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,276
"The hint is hidden in the same color as this car."

1223
00:47:48,576 --> 00:47:50,044
- Haha. - We have to look in the car.

1224
00:47:50,044 --> 00:47:51,479
No, it's with the airbags.

1225
00:47:51,479 --> 00:47:53,147
The airbags were blue.

1226
00:47:53,147 --> 00:47:54,982
- Let's go over there. - You're right.

1227
00:47:54,982 --> 00:47:56,584
Ji Hyo, you're the best.

1228
00:47:56,584 --> 00:47:57,652
Where are they?

1229
00:47:57,752 --> 00:48:00,188
- We have to climb up and down. - I see.

1230
00:48:00,321 --> 00:48:03,124
- Isn't our mission too easy? - I have no idea.

1231
00:48:03,124 --> 00:48:05,726
- This is incredible. - Look...

1232
00:48:05,726 --> 00:48:07,829
Look for anything blue as we walk.

1233
00:48:08,129 --> 00:48:09,497
Blue? I got it.

1234
00:48:11,132 --> 00:48:13,000
(They're glowing with excitement.)

1235
00:48:13,401 --> 00:48:15,236
Gosh, this is so thrilling.

1236
00:48:15,903 --> 00:48:19,540
(They're absolutely thrilled.)

1237
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,942
(Eliminating name tags was never so fun.)

1238
00:48:20,942 --> 00:48:22,844
- Seriously. - This is so much fun.

1239
00:48:23,044 --> 00:48:25,580
- It's so much fun. - We'll make it today.

1240
00:48:26,747 --> 00:48:28,149
(Team Yoon Bak starts the search.)

1241
00:48:28,149 --> 00:48:30,318
I can't control my excitement.

1242
00:48:30,718 --> 00:48:32,053
- Nothing is difficult today. - Right.

1243
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,754
We have all the energy from the universe.

1244
00:48:33,955 --> 00:48:35,490
(They gather energy from the universe.)

1245
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:38,126
We'll eliminate the name tags starting with Jong Kook.

1246
00:48:39,026 --> 00:48:41,963
We'll eliminate the name tags including Jong Kook's.

1247
00:48:42,897 --> 00:48:45,266
- You should calm down. - Right.

1248
00:48:45,299 --> 00:48:47,068
You're too excited right now.

1249
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:48,936
I'm too excited.

1250
00:48:50,638 --> 00:48:53,608
- I bet there's something nearby. - Here?

1251
00:48:53,608 --> 00:48:55,610
Do we have to find the immigration?

1252
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:57,011
Maybe there's something downstairs.

1253
00:48:57,278 --> 00:48:59,247
- Let's check downstairs. - Okay.

1254
00:49:00,515 --> 00:49:03,584
- I bet there's something here. - I agree.

1255
00:49:04,218 --> 00:49:06,120
- Check over there. I'll check here. - Thank you.

1256
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,788
I'll check the other side.

1257
00:49:07,788 --> 00:49:09,223
- Okay. - Okay.

1258
00:49:11,092 --> 00:49:12,493
Be careful, Sandara.

1259
00:49:12,593 --> 00:49:15,696
Are we separating now? What should I do?

1260
00:49:17,765 --> 00:49:19,100
I was just here.

1261
00:49:21,035 --> 00:49:25,673
(Sandara is lost.)

1262
00:49:27,608 --> 00:49:28,976
(She hurries.)

1263
00:49:30,545 --> 00:49:32,780
(Where is the immigration?)

1264
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,382
I want to be the heroine.

1265
00:49:34,882 --> 00:49:36,484
I want to survive until the end.

1266
00:49:36,484 --> 00:49:38,152
(She wants to make her teammates proud.)

1267
00:49:38,152 --> 00:49:39,820
I want to make them proud.

1268
00:49:40,922 --> 00:49:42,423
It should be around here.

1269
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:43,724
Gosh.

1270
00:49:44,525 --> 00:49:46,627
(Instead of the immigration, he finds a gorgeous car.)

1271
00:49:46,627 --> 00:49:47,695
It looks great.

1272
00:49:49,397 --> 00:49:51,432
(He stops to look at it.)

1273
00:49:51,499 --> 00:49:52,667
Gosh, what's this?

1274
00:49:55,736 --> 00:49:56,904
(He's intrigued.)

1275
00:49:57,271 --> 00:49:58,606
I don't think it's here, Sandara.

1276
00:49:59,106 --> 00:50:00,474
We must depart soon.

1277
00:50:00,474 --> 00:50:02,210
- Here we are. - Is this the right floor?

1278
00:50:03,077 --> 00:50:04,178
Good luck.

1279
00:50:04,178 --> 00:50:06,147
(He hears the voice of another team.)

1280
00:50:06,147 --> 00:50:08,316
(What kind of mission are they on?)

1281
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:10,251
There's someone.

1282
00:50:10,251 --> 00:50:13,054
(Team Yoon Bak is here.)

1283
00:50:13,054 --> 00:50:15,022
(He runs away first.)

1284
00:50:15,022 --> 00:50:17,625
Come on, let's go.

1285
00:50:18,226 --> 00:50:20,795
(Team Yoon Bak approaches Team Sandara.)

1286
00:50:20,795 --> 00:50:22,363
What's going on?

1287
00:50:22,396 --> 00:50:24,265
They're staff members.

1288
00:50:25,499 --> 00:50:26,734
They're over there.

1289
00:50:26,734 --> 00:50:27,835
There's Jong Kook.

1290
00:50:28,236 --> 00:50:29,437
They're carrying a suitcase.

1291
00:50:30,671 --> 00:50:32,206
(What are they doing?)

1292
00:50:32,206 --> 00:50:33,341
It's Kwang Soo.

1293
00:50:33,808 --> 00:50:35,042
They're carrying a suitcase.

1294
00:50:35,042 --> 00:50:36,277
What's going on?

1295
00:50:37,378 --> 00:50:38,613
What should we do?

1296
00:50:38,913 --> 00:50:40,781
Come on, Sandara.

1297
00:50:40,948 --> 00:50:44,318
(Unfortunately, Jong Kook isn't with them.)

1298
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:46,954
We shouldn't separate.

1299
00:50:48,923 --> 00:50:50,925
(Stop right there.)

1300
00:50:50,925 --> 00:50:53,894
(The teams don't know each other's missions.)

1301
00:50:53,894 --> 00:50:56,530
(However, Team Yoon Bak chases after Team Sandara.)

1302
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:59,267
- What's going on? - What are they doing?

1303
00:51:00,234 --> 00:51:02,169
- What are you doing? - What's this suitcase?

1304
00:51:02,169 --> 00:51:03,170
It's not mine.

1305
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:05,406
- What's in the suitcase? - There's nothing in it.

1306
00:51:05,406 --> 00:51:06,407
There's nothing in it.

1307
00:51:06,407 --> 00:51:07,842
- We're leaving the country. - It's nothing.

1308
00:51:07,875 --> 00:51:10,278
- Where are you going? - Where are you going?

1309
00:51:10,478 --> 00:51:12,213
- What are you doing? - Wait.

1310
00:51:12,346 --> 00:51:14,148
- What's in this? - Wait.

1311
00:51:14,382 --> 00:51:15,483
Is there something in it?

1312
00:51:15,483 --> 00:51:17,051
- Where's Jong Kook? - In the suitcase?

1313
00:51:17,051 --> 00:51:18,552
(Where is Jong Kook?)

1314
00:51:19,587 --> 00:51:24,625
(They planned to eliminate Jong Kook before the rumor spreads.)

1315
00:51:25,726 --> 00:51:26,894
(Where did he go?)

1316
00:51:27,695 --> 00:51:28,929
(Are they looking for Jong Kook?)

1317
00:51:30,197 --> 00:51:31,599
- May I see it? - No.

1318
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,334
You have no right to look inside.

1319
00:51:33,601 --> 00:51:34,935
(Sandara and Jae Seok are stopped.)

1320
00:51:34,935 --> 00:51:36,570
Are you delivering them somewhere?

1321
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:37,872
Do you have to go somewhere?

1322
00:51:38,372 --> 00:51:39,407
I can't tell you.

1323
00:51:39,473 --> 00:51:40,975
You're making it difficult.

1324
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:42,910
Why are you stopping us?

1325
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:44,211
Let's go, Sandara.

1326
00:51:44,812 --> 00:51:45,846
Wait.

1327
00:51:45,846 --> 00:51:47,581
(They let them go since Jong Kook isn't around.)

1328
00:51:48,082 --> 00:51:51,252
We must eliminate Jong Kook first.

1329
00:51:51,686 --> 00:51:53,120
Once the rumor spreads, it's over.

1330
00:51:54,355 --> 00:51:57,091
- Where did Jong Kook go? - This is such a mess.

1331
00:52:00,528 --> 00:52:01,762
Where's immigration?

1332
00:52:03,297 --> 00:52:04,532
(He can't find anything.)

1333
00:52:04,532 --> 00:52:06,534
There must be a reason why the doors are open.

1334
00:52:06,701 --> 00:52:08,502
Shouldn't there be a reason?

1335
00:52:08,502 --> 00:52:09,970
(Jong Kook searches alone.)

1336
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:11,105
(What's this?)

1337
00:52:11,806 --> 00:52:12,907
Is this immigration?

1338
00:52:12,907 --> 00:52:14,742
(He finds immigration.)

1339
00:52:14,742 --> 00:52:16,344
Hello, I'm Kim Jong Kook.

1340
00:52:16,344 --> 00:52:17,378
(He speaks in Chinese.)

1341
00:52:17,378 --> 00:52:18,479
(Hello)

1342
00:52:19,113 --> 00:52:20,881
Do you speak Chinese?

1343
00:52:20,881 --> 00:52:22,216
(What's the question?)

1344
00:52:23,517 --> 00:52:27,221
How much cash are you carrying?

1345
00:52:29,924 --> 00:52:30,925
Gosh.

1346
00:52:31,892 --> 00:52:33,094
What did he say?

1347
00:52:34,328 --> 00:52:35,730
Hold on, please.

1348
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:40,067
(Will he get through immigration with the help from the book?)

1349
00:52:40,067 --> 00:52:43,537
(He searches...)

1350
00:52:43,537 --> 00:52:46,807
(and searches.)

1351
00:52:46,807 --> 00:52:47,942
Okay.

1352
00:52:48,876 --> 00:52:53,080
(Did he tell me to buy a lottery ticket?)

1353
00:52:55,916 --> 00:52:57,351
(He finds something.)

1354
00:52:57,418 --> 00:52:59,887
(What will be his answer?)

1355
00:52:59,887 --> 00:53:02,390
I have about 116 dollars.

1356
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:05,025
(I have about 116 dollars.)

1357
00:53:05,025 --> 00:53:06,394
- You passed. - I passed.

1358
00:53:06,427 --> 00:53:08,129
(Jong Kook succeeds.)

1359
00:53:08,829 --> 00:53:09,997
Did I pass?

1360
00:53:09,997 --> 00:53:11,665
(His lonely search paid off.)

1361
00:53:11,665 --> 00:53:12,867
I can't believe it.

1362
00:53:12,867 --> 00:53:13,968
(He passes the Chinese immigration.)

1363
00:53:13,968 --> 00:53:15,336
Thank you.

1364
00:53:15,336 --> 00:53:16,670
- Goodbye. - Bye.

1365
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:17,805
(He has three more to go.)

1366
00:53:17,805 --> 00:53:18,839
I passed.

1367
00:53:20,508 --> 00:53:23,711
I see something blue over there.

1368
00:53:23,711 --> 00:53:26,547
- Gosh, this looks amazing. - It's really cool.

1369
00:53:27,848 --> 00:53:29,917
It can also lift a chair.

1370
00:53:30,151 --> 00:53:31,285
(Is it hidden among the robots?)

1371
00:53:31,285 --> 00:53:32,653
I see something blue.

1372
00:53:32,653 --> 00:53:33,921
- There it is. - I see it too.

1373
00:53:34,321 --> 00:53:35,723
- This is blue too. - We can't go inside.

1374
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:37,725
Is this it?

1375
00:53:38,626 --> 00:53:39,693
It's blue.

1376
00:53:41,695 --> 00:53:43,030
- Let's paint it. - Paint it blue.

1377
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:44,398
(They press various buttons.)

1378
00:53:44,398 --> 00:53:45,633
(He steps away.)

1379
00:53:46,867 --> 00:53:48,602
I don't think it's here.

1380
00:53:48,602 --> 00:53:50,204
(He's shy with machines.)

1381
00:53:51,038 --> 00:53:53,741
- I bet it's in here. - I think so too.

1382
00:53:54,542 --> 00:53:55,609
Why is it so difficult?

1383
00:53:55,609 --> 00:53:56,911
(Jae Suk complains.)

1384
00:53:56,911 --> 00:53:58,546
- Jae Suk. - Here it is.

1385
00:53:58,546 --> 00:54:00,781
(Haha finds it.)

1386
00:54:00,781 --> 00:54:02,016
(Find the Secret Room.)

1387
00:54:02,016 --> 00:54:03,150
Secret Room?

1388
00:54:03,484 --> 00:54:05,219
We should go down that way.

1389
00:54:05,386 --> 00:54:08,255
Secret Room? That's too hard to find.

1390
00:54:08,722 --> 00:54:10,024
Something blue is coming.

1391
00:54:10,825 --> 00:54:13,394
(Team Yoon Bak approaches secretly.)

1392
00:54:13,394 --> 00:54:14,695
- They got something. - I know.

1393
00:54:14,695 --> 00:54:16,664
- What's going on? - Something seems strange.

1394
00:54:17,832 --> 00:54:20,134
- Let's kill them. - Kill them?

1395
00:54:20,134 --> 00:54:21,268
(We aren't easy anymore.)

1396
00:54:21,836 --> 00:54:23,337
What are you doing?

1397
00:54:24,004 --> 00:54:26,407
- Something seems strange. - They're cornering us.

1398
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,675
Go over there.

1399
00:54:27,675 --> 00:54:29,743
(They start to corner them.)

1400
00:54:29,743 --> 00:54:31,445
What's going on? Bak?

1401
00:54:31,445 --> 00:54:32,913
- What? - What are you doing?

1402
00:54:32,913 --> 00:54:36,016
- We should stay together. - We should?

1403
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:37,551
What's wrong?

1404
00:54:37,551 --> 00:54:40,554
(It's time.)

1405
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:44,592
Kwang Soo, you look so suspicious.

1406
00:54:44,825 --> 00:54:45,926
(Does it show?)

1407
00:54:45,926 --> 00:54:48,629
- What are you talking about? - Why do you look out the window?

1408
00:54:48,629 --> 00:54:51,031
- My goodness. - Are you after our name tags?

1409
00:54:51,165 --> 00:54:52,633
- That's absurd. - No way.

1410
00:54:52,633 --> 00:54:55,836
(It's obvious that they're after their name tags.)

1411
00:54:55,836 --> 00:54:57,638
- What are you doing? - Give me your hand.

1412
00:54:57,638 --> 00:55:00,307
- Why? - My heart is pounding.

1413
00:55:00,307 --> 00:55:03,444
- We haven't found any hints yet. - Right.

1414
00:55:03,444 --> 00:55:06,380
- We have nothing. - We're looking for them now.

1415
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:09,149
- Find Jong Kook's team. - Where are they?

1416
00:55:09,149 --> 00:55:10,351
(Team Jae Suk escapes the crisis.)

1417
00:55:10,351 --> 00:55:12,152
We'll see you later, okay?

1418
00:55:14,054 --> 00:55:15,623
My determination faltered.

1419
00:55:15,823 --> 00:55:18,392
Hey. My goodness.

1420
00:55:18,392 --> 00:55:19,693
We're doomed, right?

1421
00:55:19,693 --> 00:55:21,428
(Our mission just got revealed, right?)

1422
00:55:22,096 --> 00:55:23,931
Hey, look.

1423
00:55:23,931 --> 00:55:26,934
- This is crazy. - Why were you doing this?

1424
00:55:26,934 --> 00:55:30,170
- What do you think I'm doing? - Gosh.

1425
00:55:30,304 --> 00:55:31,405
(It's your fault.)

1426
00:55:31,405 --> 00:55:33,240
(There are no secrets in this world.)

1427
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,643
Seriously. What's wrong with him?

1428
00:55:35,643 --> 00:55:38,479
- What does this look like? - Come to your senses.

1429
00:55:38,479 --> 00:55:41,715
- Let me tell you. We're doomed. - When you ran to them,

1430
00:55:41,749 --> 00:55:44,351
- they turned their backs. - This is going to fail.

1431
00:55:44,351 --> 00:55:46,086
(Three fools in blue)

1432
00:55:47,054 --> 00:55:49,990
- We're in trouble. - Why did you do that?

1433
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:53,327
- Don't act suspicious. - I'm sorry.

1434
00:55:53,327 --> 00:55:56,363
Roll down your sleeves.

1435
00:55:56,363 --> 00:55:58,632
- Why did you roll them up? - It's hot.

1436
00:55:58,632 --> 00:56:00,801
(He's advertising that he's aiming for name tags.)

1437
00:56:01,001 --> 00:56:02,102
(I should pull myself together.)

1438
00:56:02,102 --> 00:56:03,671
We blew it.

1439
00:56:04,939 --> 00:56:07,508
Sandara, come on.

1440
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:08,542
Okay.

1441
00:56:08,542 --> 00:56:10,544
(Let's leave this country.)

1442
00:56:10,544 --> 00:56:11,979
They're not running after our name tags yet.

1443
00:56:12,746 --> 00:56:14,848
Some of them must be after our name tags.

1444
00:56:15,816 --> 00:56:18,552
(Worried)

1445
00:56:18,552 --> 00:56:19,587
(Sandara looks back.)

1446
00:56:20,754 --> 00:56:24,024
(Is anyone following us?)

1447
00:56:24,024 --> 00:56:26,226
My goodness.

1448
00:56:28,195 --> 00:56:29,196
(Sandara looks around.)

1449
00:56:30,698 --> 00:56:33,534
(Sandara is worried.)

1450
00:56:35,069 --> 00:56:38,772
You look like someone who's fleeing at night.

1451
00:56:38,939 --> 00:56:41,175
- I'm worried someone's following. - I mean...

1452
00:56:42,176 --> 00:56:43,177
(Here we come.)

1453
00:56:43,177 --> 00:56:44,912
What are they doing?

1454
00:56:44,912 --> 00:56:46,747
- What's their mission? - I have no idea.

1455
00:56:46,747 --> 00:56:50,351
- We have to succeed before them. - We have to get it done.

1456
00:56:50,718 --> 00:56:53,821
There should be six of them, and why is it so hard to find them?

1457
00:56:53,821 --> 00:56:55,122
Exactly.

1458
00:56:55,222 --> 00:56:56,323
Where are they?

1459
00:56:57,825 --> 00:57:00,194
Team Yoon Bak is approaching.

1460
00:57:00,194 --> 00:57:02,730
- They are? - Yes.

1461
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:04,531
(Let's run.)

1462
00:57:04,932 --> 00:57:06,433
(Running)

1463
00:57:10,938 --> 00:57:12,906
(Fast)

1464
00:57:13,841 --> 00:57:16,410
- They're nowhere. - They disappeared.

1465
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:18,479
- Hurry. - They're running.

1466
00:57:18,479 --> 00:57:20,381
- I'll get them. - They're running.

1467
00:57:20,381 --> 00:57:22,182
(Bak has found his target.)

1468
00:57:22,182 --> 00:57:23,584
(Bak starts to rush.)

1469
00:57:24,652 --> 00:57:27,154
- Where are you going? - I want to stop them.

1470
00:57:27,154 --> 00:57:28,822
Stop running.

1471
00:57:28,822 --> 00:57:32,092
Bak, calm down. What's with him?

1472
00:57:32,092 --> 00:57:34,228
- Gosh. - Bak.

1473
00:57:35,129 --> 00:57:37,998
(What's that?)

1474
00:57:39,033 --> 00:57:41,068
It's so obvious he's after their name tags.

1475
00:57:42,236 --> 00:57:44,371
(Something's strange. Let's run.)

1476
00:57:44,438 --> 00:57:45,439
Let's go.

1477
00:57:45,439 --> 00:57:47,207
Calm down, Bak.

1478
00:57:47,541 --> 00:57:50,077
What's with you? Calm down.

1479
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:53,714
- I'm so worked up. - Calm down.

1480
00:57:54,348 --> 00:57:57,184
- Pull yourself together. - You're obviously after name tags.

1481
00:57:57,284 --> 00:57:59,153
Hey, be quiet.

1482
00:57:59,153 --> 00:58:00,320
(Be quiet.)

1483
00:58:00,587 --> 00:58:02,423
Are you out of your mind?

1484
00:58:02,423 --> 00:58:03,624
(They're the same.)

1485
00:58:03,624 --> 00:58:06,026
Calm yourselves down, you fools.

1486
00:58:06,026 --> 00:58:08,796
- My heart is pounding. - Are you okay?

1487
00:58:08,796 --> 00:58:11,198
- Shouldn't you lie down? - It's so funny.

1488
00:58:11,632 --> 00:58:14,568
I'll be right back.

1489
00:58:14,568 --> 00:58:16,403
- What? - I'll do it.

1490
00:58:16,437 --> 00:58:18,472
- What do you mean? - I'll remove the name tags.

1491
00:58:19,306 --> 00:58:20,941
Just go outside and run for a while.

1492
00:58:21,341 --> 00:58:23,544
Bak, you should calm down. What's with you?

1493
00:58:23,544 --> 00:58:26,213
- We don't have much time. - Your face is so red.

1494
00:58:26,213 --> 00:58:28,348
(It's time for a full-scale attack.)

1495
00:58:30,918 --> 00:58:34,621
Let's go. That's Jong Kook. Why is he on his own?

1496
00:58:35,289 --> 00:58:37,224
What is he doing?

1497
00:58:38,425 --> 00:58:40,127
(They unexpectedly find Jong Kook.)

1498
00:58:40,127 --> 00:58:41,195
Hey!

1499
00:58:41,929 --> 00:58:43,897
Why are you running alone?

1500
00:58:43,897 --> 00:58:46,066
I completed one mission.

1501
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,735
- Where? - China.

1502
00:58:47,735 --> 00:58:49,903
- Did you pass? - Yes.

1503
00:58:49,903 --> 00:58:51,939
(Jong Kook got a stamp.)

1504
00:58:51,939 --> 00:58:54,775
- He was hiding in the corner. - Are they hiding?

1505
00:58:55,142 --> 00:58:56,376
Have you run into the others?

1506
00:58:56,376 --> 00:58:58,812
Yes. But they didn't try to remove our name tags.

1507
00:58:58,812 --> 00:59:02,249
My goodness. I wish our mission was eliminating name tags too.

1508
00:59:02,249 --> 00:59:06,086
- It would have been over by now. - My goodness.

1509
00:59:06,086 --> 00:59:07,721
(Will they succeed in completing their mission?)

1510
00:59:07,721 --> 00:59:08,756
Let's go.

1511
00:59:09,323 --> 00:59:10,691
Have you looked in there?

1512
00:59:12,025 --> 00:59:12,993
(He goes closer.)

1513
00:59:16,396 --> 00:59:18,565
(He finds the second checkpoint right away.)

1514
00:59:18,565 --> 00:59:20,901
(What will be the question?)

1515
00:59:21,001 --> 00:59:22,136
(Speaking in foreign language)

1516
00:59:23,637 --> 00:59:24,705
(He takes out the books.)

1517
00:59:25,939 --> 00:59:29,143
French, Arabic...

1518
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:31,078
(Don't you get it?)

1519
00:59:32,312 --> 00:59:34,348
(Let me see.)

1520
00:59:36,316 --> 00:59:37,951
(What will be the answer?)

1521
00:59:37,951 --> 00:59:39,019
Wait.

1522
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,587
(Which language do you think it is?)

1523
00:59:40,587 --> 00:59:43,223
- It's not it? - No, it isn't.

1524
00:59:43,824 --> 00:59:44,992
Let me hear it again.

1525
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:46,093
(What language is it?)

1526
00:59:46,093 --> 00:59:47,728
Let me hear it again.

1527
00:59:47,728 --> 00:59:50,898
(Where are you from?)

1528
00:59:51,298 --> 00:59:54,001
Listening doesn't help. Look it up in the books.

1529
00:59:54,234 --> 00:59:56,737
- It sounds like... - This...

1530
00:59:56,837 --> 00:59:59,640
(It sounds a bit like French.)

1531
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,141
(He stares at the book.)

1532
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:03,944
Try to find out...

1533
01:00:04,011 --> 01:00:05,445
(Trying out)

1534
01:00:05,646 --> 01:00:09,216
- I studied French in high school. - Cut it out.

1535
01:00:09,283 --> 01:00:12,352
- I did. - I'm from Nantes.

1536
01:00:12,452 --> 01:00:13,954
(I'm from Nantes.)

1537
01:00:13,954 --> 01:00:15,088
I got this.

1538
01:00:15,088 --> 01:00:17,724
(Jong Kook is already answering the question.)

1539
01:00:17,724 --> 01:00:20,294
- Stop it. - I already found it.

1540
01:00:20,294 --> 01:00:23,730
I'm from Nantes. I'm from Korea.

1541
01:00:24,531 --> 01:00:26,633
- Correct. - What was it?

1542
01:00:26,633 --> 01:00:27,634
(Pass)

1543
01:00:27,634 --> 01:00:30,971
It was right. It means, "Where are you from?"

1544
01:00:31,004 --> 01:00:32,239
I'm from Anyang.

1545
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:33,473
(Jong Kook is a great help.)

1546
01:00:33,473 --> 01:00:34,708
There you go.

1547
01:00:34,708 --> 01:00:36,276
(They've already won 2 stamps.)

1548
01:00:36,276 --> 01:00:38,111
Are we going somewhere else now?

1549
01:00:38,645 --> 01:00:41,648
- We just need two more now. - Exactly.

1550
01:00:42,049 --> 01:00:43,250
(Let's get it done.)

1551
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:46,453
I think something must be here somewhere.

1552
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,288
I didn't see anyone here before.

1553
01:00:49,223 --> 01:00:52,492
I didn't look here earlier.

1554
01:00:53,427 --> 01:00:55,562
(Is someone hiding here?)

1555
01:00:55,562 --> 01:00:59,132
- I found someone. - They're somewhere like this.

1556
01:00:59,466 --> 01:01:02,302
- Good job. - Which country is it now?

1557
01:01:02,936 --> 01:01:05,172
I don't think we'll understand it.

1558
01:01:05,205 --> 01:01:09,443
(Speaking in foreign language)

1559
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:19,052
Do you have your passport with you?

1560
01:01:19,052 --> 01:01:20,821
It's definitely Arabic.

1561
01:01:20,821 --> 01:01:23,490
- It's definitely Arabic. - It's too long.

1562
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:25,425
(This one seems hard.)

1563
01:01:25,425 --> 01:01:26,593
- What was it again? - Hey.

1564
01:01:26,593 --> 01:01:29,529
(Do you have your passport with you?)

1565
01:01:30,797 --> 01:01:34,534
(Will they able to pass this time too?)

1566
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:38,639
- I have no idea. - Check the airport part.

1567
01:01:40,574 --> 01:01:43,277
(Will Jong Kook find the answer this time too?)

1568
01:01:43,277 --> 01:01:45,679
(Will Sandara find it?)

1569
01:01:48,849 --> 01:01:52,119
(They're desperate to pass through immigration.)

1570
01:01:53,954 --> 01:01:57,324
Yes, here's my passport. I'll show it to you.

1571
01:01:57,324 --> 01:01:59,192
Here's my passport.

1572
01:01:59,192 --> 01:02:00,894
(He seems to have found the answer.)

1573
01:02:00,894 --> 01:02:03,931
(Jong Kook hands over his passport.)

1574
01:02:03,931 --> 01:02:08,168
(Is the answer correct?)

1575
01:02:09,269 --> 01:02:12,139
- Is it correct? - Yes.

1576
01:02:12,139 --> 01:02:13,307
(Pass)

1577
01:02:13,307 --> 01:02:15,008
Jong Kook is a great help.

1578
01:02:15,008 --> 01:02:17,878
It's so easy to pass through immigration.

1579
01:02:17,878 --> 01:02:19,079
(They only need one more stamp now.)

1580
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:20,847
(Booking Race Status)

1581
01:02:20,847 --> 01:02:23,083
- We've earned 3 stamps. - We only need 1 more.

1582
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:25,552
We should be careful.

1583
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,889
We should check every wall.

1584
01:02:29,022 --> 01:02:31,124
(They have to find a door to the secret room.)

1585
01:02:31,124 --> 01:02:34,227
- It'll take long. - What's this?

1586
01:02:34,227 --> 01:02:35,529
(Is this the place?)

1587
01:02:36,563 --> 01:02:38,832
I don't think this is the place.

1588
01:02:39,266 --> 01:02:41,435
How are we going to do it?

1589
01:02:41,435 --> 01:02:43,303
(Team Yoon Bak hasn't eliminated anyone yet.)

1590
01:02:43,303 --> 01:02:44,438
We haven't checked here.

1591
01:02:47,708 --> 01:02:49,209
We keep running into her.

1592
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:52,646
(We can't run around forever.)

1593
01:02:52,646 --> 01:02:54,481
(We have to eliminate the name tags now.)

1594
01:02:54,481 --> 01:02:55,916
- What? - Come here.

1595
01:02:55,916 --> 01:02:57,451
(She tries to run away from the suspicious trio.)

1596
01:02:58,352 --> 01:03:00,187
Isn't this too much?

1597
01:03:01,321 --> 01:03:02,823
You guys keep winning the games.

1598
01:03:02,823 --> 01:03:04,124
(Bak is acting very suspicious.)

1599
01:03:05,125 --> 01:03:07,427
(Why is he following us?)

1600
01:03:07,995 --> 01:03:11,231
(It's time to remove your name tag.)

1601
01:03:12,399 --> 01:03:14,434
(Here comes Bak.)

1602
01:03:14,434 --> 01:03:16,036
- Bak! - Bak!

1603
01:03:16,036 --> 01:03:17,270
(What's wrong with him?)

1604
01:03:17,571 --> 01:03:19,006
(Ripping)

1605
01:03:19,439 --> 01:03:22,242
(Ji Hyo removes Bak's name tag, but Bak is not eliminated.)

1606
01:03:22,576 --> 01:03:25,112
- Bak! - What's with you?

1607
01:03:25,112 --> 01:03:28,015
- Who did it? - Hold on!

1608
01:03:28,882 --> 01:03:31,351
Don't do that!

1609
01:03:32,085 --> 01:03:35,389
- Please listen to me. - You come here.

1610
01:03:35,389 --> 01:03:38,025
(Ji Hyo and Haha are eliminated.)

1611
01:03:38,025 --> 01:03:39,426
Give him some water.

1612
01:03:39,793 --> 01:03:41,328
(Jae Suk runs away.)

1613
01:03:41,328 --> 01:03:43,163
Tell the other team.

1614
01:03:43,263 --> 01:03:46,833
We should start from Jong Kook.

1615
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,436
Weren't we trying to remove their name tags?

1616
01:03:49,436 --> 01:03:51,405
What do you think we've been doing?

1617
01:03:51,405 --> 01:03:53,907
- We should start from Jong Kook. - We could have...

1618
01:03:53,907 --> 01:03:56,276
eliminated Jae Seok and Sandara.

1619
01:03:56,576 --> 01:03:58,011
We'll have to attack everyone we see from now on.

1620
01:03:58,011 --> 01:04:01,548
When Bak was attacking them, I could only see the whites of his eyes.

1621
01:04:01,548 --> 01:04:04,518
- I lost control. - You completely lost control.

1622
01:04:04,518 --> 01:04:06,586
(Team Yoon Bak's cover is almost blown.)

1623
01:04:06,586 --> 01:04:08,155
We need to find the Philippines.

1624
01:04:08,155 --> 01:04:10,123
(They need only 1 more stamp.)

1625
01:04:10,524 --> 01:04:13,894
- Will we be finished then? - Something's strange.

1626
01:04:14,294 --> 01:04:16,229
- Ji Hyo and Haha are out. - What?

1627
01:04:16,463 --> 01:04:20,233
- We have to hurry. - We were right about that team.

1628
01:04:20,233 --> 01:04:22,335
(Team Yoon Bak must be after our name tags.)

1629
01:04:22,903 --> 01:04:24,004
Guys.

1630
01:04:24,004 --> 01:04:25,305
(In the hallway right next to them...)

1631
01:04:25,305 --> 01:04:28,341
(is Team Yoon Bak.)

1632
01:04:28,642 --> 01:04:29,843
At the end.

1633
01:04:29,843 --> 01:04:31,611
(They can sense somebody coming.)

1634
01:04:31,611 --> 01:04:32,612
Not there.

1635
01:04:32,946 --> 01:04:34,047
At the end.

1636
01:04:34,347 --> 01:04:35,849
- We have no other choice. - Who's there?

1637
01:04:35,849 --> 01:04:37,350
(Should we check it out?)

1638
01:04:41,288 --> 01:04:42,722
(They're about to run into Team Sandara.)

1639
01:04:44,124 --> 01:04:46,126
Let's get on the elevator. Hurry.

1640
01:04:46,393 --> 01:04:47,627
Hurry up. Let's go.

1641
01:04:47,627 --> 01:04:48,695
(They get on the elevator.)

1642
01:04:49,329 --> 01:04:50,363
Hurry up. Let's go.

1643
01:04:50,363 --> 01:04:51,398
Let's go.

1644
01:04:51,398 --> 01:04:53,533
- Get on the elevator. - Come.

1645
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,837
(Can you help us complete our mission?)

1646
01:04:56,837 --> 01:04:58,839
(Dashing)

1647
01:04:58,839 --> 01:05:00,707
- Hurry. Go. - Let's go.

1648
01:05:01,108 --> 01:05:03,043
- Go. Go first. - Let's go.

1649
01:05:03,376 --> 01:05:06,146
Go. Go first.

1650
01:05:06,379 --> 01:05:08,115
- Go down. - Hey.

1651
01:05:08,115 --> 01:05:10,083
Go. You have to go.

1652
01:05:10,851 --> 01:05:12,018
Go in the elevator.

1653
01:05:12,018 --> 01:05:13,787
- Go, Sandara. - Don't let her go.

1654
01:05:14,354 --> 01:05:15,989
(Go, Sandara.)

1655
01:05:15,989 --> 01:05:17,324
- Help me. - He's out.

1656
01:05:17,324 --> 01:05:18,625
- Hey. - What's this about?

1657
01:05:18,825 --> 01:05:21,228
- Go down. - This doesn't make sense.

1658
01:05:21,294 --> 01:05:22,562
- Bak. - Go down.

1659
01:05:22,562 --> 01:05:24,097
Hurry, Kwang Soo!

1660
01:05:24,097 --> 01:05:25,198
(She's anxious.)

1661
01:05:25,198 --> 01:05:26,867
What do I do?

1662
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,503
I got separated from my team again.

1663
01:05:29,703 --> 01:05:31,404
(I'll get my revenge.)

1664
01:05:31,404 --> 01:05:32,772
I have to survive.

1665
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,142
We must get rid of...

1666
01:05:35,475 --> 01:05:36,776
- these villains. - Kwang Soo.

1667
01:05:36,776 --> 01:05:40,113
We're the villains. We're the villains.

1668
01:05:40,113 --> 01:05:42,349
- How could you? - Go away.

1669
01:05:43,049 --> 01:05:44,818
- You villains. - Hey.

1670
01:05:44,951 --> 01:05:47,387
- You villains. - We're the good people.

1671
01:05:47,521 --> 01:05:48,922
We're the good people.

1672
01:05:48,989 --> 01:05:50,423
- We're the good people. - What's going on?

1673
01:05:50,423 --> 01:05:52,526
Why didn't you rip Sandara's name tag?

1674
01:05:52,526 --> 01:05:53,727
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

1675
01:05:53,727 --> 01:05:55,495
There's Sandara and Jae Suk left.

1676
01:05:55,495 --> 01:05:56,830
(Only Sandara and Jae Suk are left.)

1677
01:05:57,397 --> 01:05:58,532
Come here, Bak!

1678
01:05:58,532 --> 01:06:00,634
(Now, everybody knows Team Yoon Bak's mission.)

1679
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:01,768
Bak.

1680
01:06:01,768 --> 01:06:04,237
Use it. Hurry. Where's the Death Note?

1681
01:06:04,237 --> 01:06:05,972
Where's the Death Note?

1682
01:06:05,972 --> 01:06:07,774
(Death Note?)

1683
01:06:08,909 --> 01:06:10,177
If you use all of them,

1684
01:06:10,877 --> 01:06:11,945
you get a Death Note.

1685
01:06:11,945 --> 01:06:15,182
(They get a Death Note for three VIP tickets.)

1686
01:06:15,182 --> 01:06:16,316
(They obtained the Death Note.)

1687
01:06:16,883 --> 01:06:17,984
There you go.

1688
01:06:17,984 --> 01:06:19,886
- Why aren't you taking it? - Please take it.

1689
01:06:20,387 --> 01:06:22,322
Let's rip Jong Kook's name tag...

1690
01:06:22,322 --> 01:06:24,124
and keep this for later.

1691
01:06:25,025 --> 01:06:26,826
(They planned to get rid of Jong Kook first.)

1692
01:06:26,826 --> 01:06:27,994
I'm getting goosebumps.

1693
01:06:27,994 --> 01:06:29,930
I can't help but smile while I'm saying this.

1694
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:31,565
What's going on with me?

1695
01:06:31,731 --> 01:06:33,300
Use it. Hurry up.

1696
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:35,035
- Where's the Death Note? - Seok Jin has it.

1697
01:06:35,035 --> 01:06:36,303
- Seok Jin... - Seok Jin.

1698
01:06:37,337 --> 01:06:38,405
Seok Jin.

1699
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:41,041
Seok Jin!

1700
01:06:41,675 --> 01:06:43,043
Seok Jin!

1701
01:06:44,444 --> 01:06:45,946
Where is he?

1702
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:47,914
Seok Jin!

1703
01:06:48,114 --> 01:06:49,816
- What is it? - Use it!

1704
01:06:50,483 --> 01:06:51,785
(They finally find him.)

1705
01:06:51,785 --> 01:06:53,386
- Hey. - Seok Jin!

1706
01:06:53,386 --> 01:06:54,888
Hey.

1707
01:06:55,855 --> 01:06:57,023
Sandara...

1708
01:06:57,624 --> 01:06:58,892
is about to win.

1709
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:01,394
- Do you remember the stamp? - Use it.

1710
01:07:01,394 --> 01:07:03,230
- They're trying to do something. - Sandara... Listen.

1711
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:04,998
Jong Kook and Jae Seok...

1712
01:07:04,998 --> 01:07:07,300
- helped Sandara escape. - Right.

1713
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,368
They were so calm.

1714
01:07:08,368 --> 01:07:10,170
Right, they were.

1715
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:11,238
- Let's use it. - Write her name.

1716
01:07:11,571 --> 01:07:12,706
- Sandara. - Do we write her name?

1717
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:14,207
I have no idea where she is.

1718
01:07:14,207 --> 01:07:15,408
(They decide to get rid of Sandara.)

1719
01:07:15,475 --> 01:07:17,244
We can't even see her.

1720
01:07:17,811 --> 01:07:19,012
I wrote her name.

1721
01:07:19,112 --> 01:07:20,280
Eliminate her.

1722
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:24,184
Sandara Park is out. Sandara Park is out.

1723
01:07:24,918 --> 01:07:27,254
Sandara Park is out.

1724
01:07:27,254 --> 01:07:30,023
(What? I'm out?)

1725
01:07:31,191 --> 01:07:33,693
- We just have to eliminate Jae Suk. - I'm so tired.

1726
01:07:33,693 --> 01:07:35,195
We just have to eliminate him.

1727
01:07:36,396 --> 01:07:40,600
(He's looking for the Secret Room.)

1728
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,735
Hold on.

1729
01:07:42,469 --> 01:07:45,538
(He finds a suspicious emergency exit.)

1730
01:07:46,606 --> 01:07:48,508
(Peeking)

1731
01:07:56,549 --> 01:07:59,386
(He finally finds it.)

1732
01:08:00,086 --> 01:08:03,490
(What hint does he find?)

1733
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:05,258
"A car that cries and twinkles".

1734
01:08:06,426 --> 01:08:07,594
I think I've seen this before.

1735
01:08:10,463 --> 01:08:11,631
Should we split?

1736
01:08:11,931 --> 01:08:13,867
- Should we? - It doesn't matter, right?

1737
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,602
Let's split and look for him.

1738
01:08:15,602 --> 01:08:16,636
- Sure. - Let's go.

1739
01:08:16,703 --> 01:08:18,138
This place is too big to stay together.

1740
01:08:18,138 --> 01:08:19,539
- I'll check out that side... - Sure.

1741
01:08:19,539 --> 01:08:20,707
where the airbags are.

1742
01:08:20,707 --> 01:08:21,741
(Where could he be?)

1743
01:08:21,741 --> 01:08:22,876
Where can he be?

1744
01:08:24,644 --> 01:08:25,979
(Sliding)

1745
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:27,113
Be quiet.

1746
01:08:27,113 --> 01:08:29,949
(He's in this alone.)

1747
01:08:29,949 --> 01:08:32,385
(I will survive until the end.)

1748
01:08:34,287 --> 01:08:36,690
(He darts in and out of places.)

1749
01:08:37,891 --> 01:08:39,292
I have no idea where he is.

1750
01:08:40,994 --> 01:08:42,495
"A car that cries and twinkles".

1751
01:08:42,762 --> 01:08:44,030
What can that be?

1752
01:08:44,197 --> 01:08:47,233
(What on earth is it?)

1753
01:08:53,006 --> 01:08:55,075
(What's over there?)

1754
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:56,876
(Roaring)

1755
01:08:58,812 --> 01:09:03,383
(Fourth hint spot: a car that cries and twinkles)

1756
01:09:05,385 --> 01:09:06,753
Twinkling...

1757
01:09:07,253 --> 01:09:08,455
and crying.

1758
01:09:09,989 --> 01:09:12,325
(He starts searching the car.)

1759
01:09:15,028 --> 01:09:16,096
Okay.

1760
01:09:16,096 --> 01:09:18,765
(He finds the hint.)

1761
01:09:19,466 --> 01:09:22,302
(What does the last hint say?)

1762
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:31,711
(The true Supercar is outside.)

1763
01:09:31,711 --> 01:09:34,714
(It's outside?)

1764
01:09:34,714 --> 01:09:35,882
Outside.

1765
01:09:36,015 --> 01:09:39,018
Is this the key to the Supercar?

1766
01:09:39,018 --> 01:09:40,053
(He takes the mini key...)

1767
01:09:40,053 --> 01:09:44,023
(and heads outside to look for the true Supercar.)

1768
01:09:45,625 --> 01:09:46,826
Supercar.

1769
01:09:48,595 --> 01:09:50,497
(He's almost there.)

1770
01:09:50,497 --> 01:09:51,698
First floor.

1771
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:56,069
(Will he be able to find it?)

1772
01:09:57,871 --> 01:09:59,606
- Let's go. - He's done.

1773
01:09:59,606 --> 01:10:01,541
It's so big. We can't find him.

1774
01:10:01,808 --> 01:10:03,910
Where's Jae Suk? How do we find him?

1775
01:10:04,177 --> 01:10:05,211
What's this?

1776
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,214
What's this?

1777
01:10:08,214 --> 01:10:09,582
(What's this on the floor?)

1778
01:10:09,582 --> 01:10:11,017
"The true Supercar..."

1779
01:10:11,518 --> 01:10:14,721
(They find the hint that was left behind.)

1780
01:10:14,721 --> 01:10:16,389
(What if this is Team Jae Suk's hint?)

1781
01:10:16,389 --> 01:10:18,124
- What's this? - Someone left it behind.

1782
01:10:18,324 --> 01:10:19,793
Maybe they're running away on the supercar.

1783
01:10:19,793 --> 01:10:21,094
He's outside.

1784
01:10:21,494 --> 01:10:23,096
- He's outside. - Let's go.

1785
01:10:23,163 --> 01:10:24,330
He's outside.

1786
01:10:24,464 --> 01:10:26,332
- Bak, go outside. - Outside.

1787
01:10:26,332 --> 01:10:27,534
Let's go outside.

1788
01:10:27,534 --> 01:10:29,836
(Bak sprints outside.)

1789
01:10:32,105 --> 01:10:33,807
(Gazing)

1790
01:10:35,008 --> 01:10:38,244
(There's nobody here, right?)

1791
01:10:40,547 --> 01:10:42,115
(Who's there?)

1792
01:10:42,115 --> 01:10:43,450
Who's that?

1793
01:10:43,450 --> 01:10:44,584
Seok Jin!

1794
01:10:44,584 --> 01:10:47,020
(Their last target, Jae Suk, is spotted.)

1795
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:50,423
(They win if they rip his name tag.)

1796
01:10:50,423 --> 01:10:51,424
Seok Jin!

1797
01:10:51,424 --> 01:10:53,259
(Their prey is in front of them.)

1798
01:10:54,794 --> 01:10:56,329
- Why did you come here? - Seok Jin.

1799
01:10:56,329 --> 01:10:57,363
Why did you come here?

1800
01:10:57,363 --> 01:10:58,431
(Why is Jae Suk so fast?)

1801
01:10:59,065 --> 01:11:00,099
(He slips away.)

1802
01:11:00,099 --> 01:11:01,201
There must be a way.

1803
01:11:02,602 --> 01:11:03,703
Seok Jin!

1804
01:11:04,103 --> 01:11:05,338
Kwang Soo.

1805
01:11:06,005 --> 01:11:08,007
Hey, how do we go outside?

1806
01:11:09,008 --> 01:11:11,544
(Jae Suk reaches outside without getting caught.)

1807
01:11:12,779 --> 01:11:14,814
- Go outside. - There he is.

1808
01:11:15,582 --> 01:11:17,784
(Every second makes a difference.)

1809
01:11:17,784 --> 01:11:19,752
(Will he get the hint first?)

1810
01:11:19,752 --> 01:11:22,622
- What are you doing? - Wait.

1811
01:11:22,622 --> 01:11:23,756
(Or will they get his name tag?)

1812
01:11:23,756 --> 01:11:24,824
Catch him.

1813
01:11:25,725 --> 01:11:27,694
(Ripping)

1814
01:11:27,694 --> 01:11:29,696
(Jae Suk is out.)

1815
01:11:29,696 --> 01:11:30,763
I'm sorry.

1816
01:11:32,632 --> 01:11:35,301
- Have we completed our mission? - We're done.

1817
01:11:35,468 --> 01:11:37,003
You did all the running, Bak.

1818
01:11:37,003 --> 01:11:38,238
(Team Yoon Bak completes their mission.)

1819
01:11:40,406 --> 01:11:41,975
We ripped everybody's name tag.

1820
01:11:41,975 --> 01:11:43,376
- We did. - We did.

1821
01:11:43,576 --> 01:11:45,011
- Did you rip everybody's name tags? - Yes.

1822
01:11:45,011 --> 01:11:46,379
Team Yoon Bak is the winner.

1823
01:11:47,113 --> 01:11:48,915
- And then? - However...

1824
01:11:48,915 --> 01:11:49,916
"However"?

1825
01:11:49,916 --> 01:11:51,851
Team Sandara also wins.

1826
01:11:52,819 --> 01:11:53,820
What's going on?

1827
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:55,588
(But we eliminated everybody.)

1828
01:11:56,623 --> 01:11:59,993
(While Sandara was looking for her last mission,)

1829
01:11:59,993 --> 01:12:02,495
(Team Yoon Bak was looking for Seok Jin to use the Death Note.)

1830
01:12:02,529 --> 01:12:03,663
Seok Jin.

1831
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:05,465
(Thanks to Seok Jin's absence,)

1832
01:12:05,865 --> 01:12:09,269
(Sandara completed her mission first.)

1833
01:12:11,037 --> 01:12:12,372
(This must be a dream.)

1834
01:12:12,372 --> 01:12:14,307
You were the villain.

1835
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:15,909
You found the ginseng before you were eliminated,

1836
01:12:15,909 --> 01:12:17,043
- right? - Yes.

1837
01:12:17,043 --> 01:12:18,144
You found the ginseng before you were eliminated, right?

1838
01:12:18,144 --> 01:12:19,178
Yes.

1839
01:12:19,212 --> 01:12:20,513
You have completed your mission.

1840
01:12:20,513 --> 01:12:22,515
(Team Jae Suk was eliminated, but they still completed their mission.)

1841
01:12:22,515 --> 01:12:23,917
- My goodness. - My gosh.

1842
01:12:23,983 --> 01:12:25,885
What about us?

1843
01:12:27,554 --> 01:12:29,222
(While Team Yoon Bak was looking for Jae Suk)

1844
01:12:29,222 --> 01:12:30,256
Kwang Soo.

1845
01:12:31,124 --> 01:12:33,092
Hey, how do we go outside?

1846
01:12:34,294 --> 01:12:35,895
(Jae Suk found the Supercar first.)

1847
01:12:35,895 --> 01:12:37,964
I have to open this.

1848
01:12:37,964 --> 01:12:40,433
(Team Jae Suk completed their mission.)

1849
01:12:40,433 --> 01:12:42,735
(Jackpot)

1850
01:12:42,735 --> 01:12:44,437
(He's happy.)

1851
01:12:44,437 --> 01:12:45,772
- What? - It's over.

1852
01:12:45,772 --> 01:12:47,206
- What's over? - It's over.

1853
01:12:47,707 --> 01:12:49,542
You finished last...

1854
01:12:49,609 --> 01:12:51,077
after Jae Suk completed his mission.

1855
01:12:51,077 --> 01:12:52,145
(They came in last.)

1856
01:12:52,145 --> 01:12:53,413
So...

1857
01:12:53,846 --> 01:12:55,348
We're in last place?

1858
01:12:56,382 --> 01:12:59,352
We have to pick one person from your team.

1859
01:12:59,352 --> 01:13:00,920
Kwang Soo told me this earlier.

1860
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,722
- He did. - He's never had...

1861
01:13:02,722 --> 01:13:04,324
a water bomb.

1862
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:05,525
That's why...

1863
01:13:05,525 --> 01:13:07,927
- I recommend him. - I'll survive.

1864
01:13:08,094 --> 01:13:09,495
- I'll survive. - Really?

1865
01:13:09,596 --> 01:13:12,765
I think he'll get the water bomb for the first time.

1866
01:13:13,433 --> 01:13:14,601
- Kwang Soo. - Let's go. What?

1867
01:13:14,867 --> 01:13:17,203
- No, don't listen to him. - He's never done it before.

1868
01:13:17,403 --> 01:13:18,871
- Let's go. - It's one try.

1869
01:13:18,972 --> 01:13:20,139
It's one try.

1870
01:13:20,139 --> 01:13:21,341
(The roulette is spinning.)

1871
01:13:22,308 --> 01:13:26,279
(This is the worst that can happen for Team Yoon Bak.)

1872
01:13:27,747 --> 01:13:28,881
Please...

1873
01:13:30,083 --> 01:13:34,153
(Who'll be the unlucky person to receive the water bomb?)

1874
01:13:36,689 --> 01:13:40,126
(It's Bak.)

1875
01:13:40,126 --> 01:13:41,761
(Bak saved us.)

1876
01:13:41,761 --> 01:13:43,062
This is unbelievable.

1877
01:13:43,529 --> 01:13:44,697
How could it be?

1878
01:13:45,632 --> 01:13:47,767
It's Bak. He's so unlucky.

1879
01:13:47,767 --> 01:13:49,836
- Thank you. - He ripped everybody's name tags.

1880
01:13:51,304 --> 01:13:53,573
(Bak will receive the penalty today.)

1881
01:13:54,107 --> 01:13:55,541
I feel so bad for him.

1882
01:13:55,541 --> 01:13:57,076
- He ended up in the wrong team. - Exactly.

1883
01:13:57,076 --> 01:13:58,711
He worked so hard.

1884
01:13:58,711 --> 01:14:01,381
I think the universe was on my side.

1885
01:14:01,381 --> 01:14:04,717
- I had a great time. - We were so close.

1886
01:14:04,717 --> 01:14:07,654
Remember what I said? Bak always tries his best,

1887
01:14:07,654 --> 01:14:10,390
- but other teams don't like him. - He's slightly...

1888
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:11,791
- annoying. - I agree.

1889
01:14:11,791 --> 01:14:13,760
Look at him.

1890
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,328
Look at him. That's what I'm talking about.

1891
01:14:15,328 --> 01:14:16,362
Let's go!

1892
01:14:17,163 --> 01:14:18,631
- Is he in the center? - Yes.

1893
01:14:18,631 --> 01:14:20,133
(The water bomb is ready.)

1894
01:14:20,133 --> 01:14:22,168
I hate it.

1895
01:14:22,168 --> 01:14:23,302
It's coming.

1896
01:14:23,503 --> 01:14:25,838
(The water bomb goes off.)

1897
01:14:26,673 --> 01:14:28,608
It makes you bow, right?

1898
01:14:28,608 --> 01:14:30,176
(That would get rid of all the fine dust.)

1899
01:14:30,176 --> 01:14:32,011
(He's still got so much energy left in him.)

1900
01:14:32,011 --> 01:14:33,913
- Excellent. - We had...

1901
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:37,884
Sandara, Jae Suk, and Bak join us today.

1902
01:14:37,884 --> 01:14:41,721
Thank you for trying your best and enjoying your time here.

1903
01:14:41,721 --> 01:14:43,423
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1904
01:14:43,523 --> 01:14:46,592
(Let us introduce two new Running Man members.)

1905
01:14:47,694 --> 01:14:50,496
(Next week, Jeon So Min and Yang Se Chan will join Running Man.)

1906
01:14:51,097 --> 01:14:52,832
(3 days before the article was published)

1907
01:14:53,499 --> 01:14:57,036
(The staff hid cameras for the interview.)

1908
01:14:57,036 --> 01:14:58,671
(Here's camera 1.)

1909
01:14:58,671 --> 01:15:00,373
(This is camera 2.)

1910
01:15:01,274 --> 01:15:02,809
(Moments later)

1911
01:15:02,809 --> 01:15:04,644
- Hello. - Hello.

1912
01:15:05,812 --> 01:15:07,080
(This new member must be a fashionista.)

1913
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,148
- Sorry for asking to meet so early. - It's okay.

1914
01:15:09,816 --> 01:15:11,084
I'm happy...

1915
01:15:11,184 --> 01:15:12,318
about eating.

1916
01:15:14,153 --> 01:15:16,155
(So Min is the 1st new member.)

1917
01:15:16,255 --> 01:15:19,826
What do you think about joining us?

1918
01:15:19,826 --> 01:15:23,362
Can I join if I want to?

1919
01:15:23,463 --> 01:15:27,567
Your opinion matters the most. If you say no, we'll just eat.

1920
01:15:28,067 --> 01:15:29,702
When I first got the call,

1921
01:15:30,002 --> 01:15:31,704
I said yes...

1922
01:15:31,804 --> 01:15:33,806
and asked, "How many candidates are ahead of me?"

1923
01:15:34,373 --> 01:15:38,077
I had to move up the line...

1924
01:15:38,344 --> 01:15:39,645
so...

1925
01:15:39,879 --> 01:15:42,014
female candidates would have to either get married or be pregnant.

1926
01:15:43,249 --> 01:15:46,219
I was wondering how far I was on the list.

1927
01:15:46,219 --> 01:15:47,487
(She can't believe she's being asked to join.)

1928
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:50,890
I'm worried because I'm not good at anything.

1929
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:52,425
I'm not smart.

1930
01:15:52,425 --> 01:15:55,194
I've never done a sit-up in my life.

1931
01:15:55,762 --> 01:15:57,764
- Not even 1? - I can't even do 1.

1932
01:15:57,764 --> 01:15:59,465
I run 100m in 21 seconds.

1933
01:15:59,866 --> 01:16:00,967
That's slow.

1934
01:16:01,934 --> 01:16:04,737
I'm sorry to say this but that's fast for me.

1935
01:16:04,804 --> 01:16:06,939
I can sense how innocent you are.

1936
01:16:07,607 --> 01:16:09,475
Thank you, but I'm not that innocent.

1937
01:16:09,809 --> 01:16:12,044
I am actually quite dirty.

1938
01:16:12,078 --> 01:16:13,780
(She makes a surprising confession.)

1939
01:16:13,813 --> 01:16:15,915
- Right? - Are you like that?

1940
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:20,486
(When was her first kiss?)

1941
01:16:20,486 --> 01:16:22,221
(It was at a bus station when I was 21.)

1942
01:16:22,221 --> 01:16:25,391
(That's so romantic.)

1943
01:16:25,625 --> 01:16:32,031
(It was after the last bus left. Her first kiss was unexpected.)

1944
01:16:32,031 --> 01:16:36,602
(It was her first kiss so how was it?)

1945
01:16:36,602 --> 01:16:40,506
(It was my first kiss. I thought I'd hear bells ringing.)

1946
01:16:40,506 --> 01:16:43,810
(I only remember the smell of his saliva.)

1947
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:49,582
(You were supposed to talk about the kiss, not the saliva.)

1948
01:16:49,582 --> 01:16:51,217
(So Min is honest and random.)

1949
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:53,152
I'm not very...

1950
01:16:53,152 --> 01:16:54,654
(She confesses.)

1951
01:16:54,654 --> 01:16:58,391
I'm not very comfortable being on variety shows.

1952
01:16:58,591 --> 01:16:59,826
I find it difficult.

1953
01:17:00,193 --> 01:17:03,696
(She finds variety shows difficult?)

1954
01:17:03,696 --> 01:17:08,835
(They play a game to find out about each other's preferences.)

1955
01:17:08,835 --> 01:17:16,576
(When I'm in a relationship, I'm the one who usually gets dumped.)

1956
01:17:17,243 --> 01:17:19,812
(Kwang Soo says no?)

1957
01:17:19,812 --> 01:17:23,683
(Does he usually dump girls then?)

1958
01:17:23,683 --> 01:17:27,954
(We know you always get dumped.)

1959
01:17:27,954 --> 01:17:30,256
(My ex-girlfriend was cheating on me so I asked her to break up.)

1960
01:17:30,256 --> 01:17:31,324
(That's getting dumped.)

1961
01:17:31,824 --> 01:17:36,662
(You got dumped.)

1962
01:17:36,662 --> 01:17:38,898
(How's that getting dumped?)

1963
01:17:38,898 --> 01:17:40,833
(You were betrayed from the beginning.)

1964
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:43,603
(I dumped her!)

1965
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:48,374
(How many times has So Min dated?)

1966
01:17:48,374 --> 01:17:49,942
(3 times)

1967
01:17:49,942 --> 01:17:51,510
(How many times were you dumped?)

1968
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:54,547
(2 times)

1969
01:17:54,547 --> 01:17:58,551
(Why is everybody so quiet?)

1970
01:17:58,551 --> 01:18:05,324
(Sorry for asking about your breakups.)

1971
01:18:05,324 --> 01:18:07,693
(Did you dump the last one?)

1972
01:18:07,693 --> 01:18:12,398
(He cheated on her but she refused to break up with him.)

1973
01:18:12,398 --> 01:18:14,300
(Stop it.)

1974
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:19,805
(She got dumped 2 times, and the last one cheated on her.)

1975
01:18:19,805 --> 01:18:23,242
(You told Kwang Soo being cheated on was getting dumped.)

1976
01:18:23,709 --> 01:18:27,580
(You got dumped all three times.)

1977
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:30,449
(He's the female version of Kwang Soo.)

1978
01:18:30,449 --> 01:18:34,153
(We both got kicked around.)

1979
01:18:35,021 --> 01:18:37,590
(I asked him to come back to me, and he said no.)

1980
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:40,192
(I tried that too, and she told me to get lost.)

1981
01:18:40,192 --> 01:18:42,495
(Kwang Soo's spot in Running Man is being threatened.)

1982
01:18:43,095 --> 01:18:44,297
(And...)

1983
01:18:44,297 --> 01:18:45,965
- Hello. - Hello.

1984
01:18:45,965 --> 01:18:47,033
(Here's the other new member.)

1985
01:18:47,033 --> 01:18:49,335
(It's Se Chan.)

1986
01:18:49,835 --> 01:18:51,537
What are you good at?

1987
01:18:51,537 --> 01:18:53,606
I rarely lose when playing games.

1988
01:18:55,207 --> 01:18:56,943
You know arcade games?

1989
01:18:57,343 --> 01:18:58,878
I can beat every celebrity.

1990
01:18:59,278 --> 01:19:02,181
I heard Jae Seok is the king of ddakji,

1991
01:19:02,982 --> 01:19:04,317
but I'm also pretty good.

1992
01:19:04,483 --> 01:19:06,852
Can you beat Jong Kook in games?

1993
01:19:07,053 --> 01:19:08,454
Of course.

1994
01:19:08,454 --> 01:19:10,623
I can beat him as long as it doesn't require strength.

1995
01:19:10,623 --> 01:19:12,258
(He's beyond Jong Kook when it comes to games.)

1996
01:19:12,825 --> 01:19:15,494
(Here's a sneak peek of his skills.)

1997
01:19:15,494 --> 01:19:20,733
(You must provide irrelevant answers to the questions.)

1998
01:19:20,733 --> 01:19:22,001
(What do you want to say to your new girlfriend?)

1999
01:19:22,001 --> 01:19:24,136
(Southern ape)

2000
01:19:24,136 --> 01:19:29,375
(Dear girlfriend. It's nice to meet you, Southern ape.)

2001
01:19:29,375 --> 01:19:34,113
(You can't call your girlfriend so.)

2002
01:19:34,113 --> 01:19:37,750
(How's this irrelevant?)

2003
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:41,721
(He might end up meeting a woman who looks primitive.)

2004
01:19:41,721 --> 01:19:43,289
(It's Se Chan's turn.)

2005
01:19:43,289 --> 01:19:44,757
(I'll show you how to play this game.)

2006
01:19:44,757 --> 01:19:46,592
- Where do you itch? - My knee hurts.

2007
01:19:46,592 --> 01:19:47,927
- What is your nickname? - Strawberry.

2008
01:19:49,695 --> 01:19:53,165
(His official nickname is strawberry.)

2009
01:19:53,165 --> 01:19:57,837
(He said he was good at games. He's Strawberry Yang.)

2010
01:19:57,837 --> 01:19:59,372
(He's embarrassed.)

2011
01:20:00,172 --> 01:20:02,441
(You are the same as your brother.)

2012
01:20:02,441 --> 01:20:05,678
(The Yang brothers are all talk.)

2013
01:20:05,678 --> 01:20:09,515
(Your brother lost in everything on Saturday.)

2014
01:20:09,515 --> 01:20:12,451
(Don't make fun of my brother. He's good at games.)

2015
01:20:12,451 --> 01:20:15,788
(Don't make fun of my brother.)

2016
01:20:15,788 --> 01:20:20,026
(The Yang brothers have a close bond.)

2017
01:20:21,694 --> 01:20:23,562
(Somebody unexpected shows up.)

2018
01:20:23,562 --> 01:20:25,297
- Hello. - Hello.

2019
01:20:25,297 --> 01:20:27,099
(His brother, Se Hyung, shows up.)

2020
01:20:27,733 --> 01:20:29,001
(He calls his brother to see his reaction.)

2021
01:20:29,001 --> 01:20:30,302
- Hello? - It's me.

2022
01:20:30,936 --> 01:20:33,305
- Where are you? - I'm on a radio show.

2023
01:20:33,339 --> 01:20:36,342
I'm in SBS for a short meeting.

2024
01:20:37,276 --> 01:20:39,712
Can you come by when you're done?

2025
01:20:39,712 --> 01:20:42,214
Sure. I'll come over when I'm done.

2026
01:20:42,681 --> 01:20:44,517
- Is this confirmed? - Yes.

2027
01:20:45,484 --> 01:20:46,619
(That's incredible.)

2028
01:20:46,619 --> 01:20:47,820
- Really? - Yes.

2029
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:50,723
My brother is better than me in many things.

2030
01:20:50,723 --> 01:20:53,025
He's funnier than me,

2031
01:20:53,426 --> 01:20:57,263
so I knew he'll get lucky like me...

2032
01:20:57,463 --> 01:20:59,398
but I didn't know it'd be this fast.

2033
01:20:59,398 --> 01:21:00,399
(He's embarrassed.)

2034
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,837
You're already working with Jae Seok and Haha,

2035
01:21:05,104 --> 01:21:07,373
so is there anything you'd like to tell your brother about them?

2036
01:21:08,607 --> 01:21:11,844
I don't know exactly either,

2037
01:21:11,977 --> 01:21:14,013
but from what I feel,

2038
01:21:14,313 --> 01:21:16,348
Jae Seok...

2039
01:21:16,715 --> 01:21:19,285
always goes around and asks each person a question.

2040
01:21:19,452 --> 01:21:24,023
Make sure you think of an answer beforehand.

2041
01:21:24,223 --> 01:21:25,391
If you can't think of one...

2042
01:21:25,391 --> 01:21:27,793
Let's say you're Jae Seok and I'm you.

2043
01:21:27,793 --> 01:21:29,328
If you can't think of anything,

2044
01:21:29,328 --> 01:21:30,830
then do this.

2045
01:21:30,830 --> 01:21:33,999
"What do you think? I see."

2046
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,401
(He looks away.)

2047
01:21:35,401 --> 01:21:36,936
I don't think he'll like that.

2048
01:21:37,336 --> 01:21:38,637
(He looks away.)

2049
01:21:38,637 --> 01:21:40,039
I looked in his direction...

2050
01:21:40,039 --> 01:21:41,740
(Pretend like Jae Seok is Medusa.)

2051
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:43,209
- Then he won't ask. - He won't?

2052
01:21:43,342 --> 01:21:45,211
- When you're not ready? - Yes, he knows.

2053
01:21:45,211 --> 01:21:48,447
But if you're ready to answer his question...

2054
01:21:48,447 --> 01:21:50,883
"Let me ask you a question."

2055
01:21:50,883 --> 01:21:52,485
(Staring)

2056
01:21:52,485 --> 01:21:54,520
- "Would you like to say something?" - "I..."

2057
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:56,122
(Make eye contact with Jae Seok.)

2058
01:21:56,122 --> 01:21:58,190
Look at him when I'm ready...

2059
01:21:58,190 --> 01:22:00,192
- and when I'm not... - Look away.

2060
01:22:00,292 --> 01:22:01,994
- It works. - Really?

2061
01:22:02,194 --> 01:22:04,597
On the other hand, Haha...

2062
01:22:04,597 --> 01:22:06,132
is very fashionable.

2063
01:22:06,465 --> 01:22:08,300
So if there's a cap,

2064
01:22:09,301 --> 01:22:10,302
ask, "What's this?"

2065
01:22:10,302 --> 01:22:11,537
(Look interested.)

2066
01:22:11,537 --> 01:22:14,406
- Then he starts explaining. - Like where it came from?

2067
01:22:14,507 --> 01:22:15,674
(Keep fidgeting with it.)

2068
01:22:15,674 --> 01:22:18,043
If you say it's pretty and look in the mirror,

2069
01:22:18,444 --> 01:22:20,379
- he asks if you want one. - Really?

2070
01:22:21,013 --> 01:22:22,448
You have to say no.

2071
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:23,949
Then he'll buy you one.

2072
01:22:23,949 --> 01:22:26,118
(He'll buy you one if you say no.)

2073
01:22:26,118 --> 01:22:27,853
(It's so easy getting gifts from Haha.)

2074
01:22:27,853 --> 01:22:30,156
- I got it. - It's a secret.

2075
01:22:30,523 --> 01:22:31,924
That's a great tip.

2076
01:22:32,024 --> 01:22:33,225
- Thank you. - Sure.

2077
01:22:33,225 --> 01:22:34,493
- Thank you. - No problem.

2078
01:22:34,493 --> 01:22:36,095
(His lecture finishes.)

2079
01:22:36,095 --> 01:22:38,931
I'll try my best and run to the best of my ability.

2080
01:22:39,131 --> 01:22:41,500
I'll stomp everyone who gets in my way.

2081
01:22:42,801 --> 01:22:43,869
(My determination)

2082
01:22:43,869 --> 01:22:47,640
I don't know. Variety shows are scary for me.

2083
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:50,042
"Would this be funny?"

2084
01:22:50,042 --> 01:22:51,877
"I've seen this a lot."

2085
01:22:51,877 --> 01:22:52,912
"Can I try again?"

2086
01:22:53,112 --> 01:22:54,180
My goodness.

2087
01:22:54,613 --> 01:22:57,816
Thank you for recruiting me.

2088
01:22:58,918 --> 01:23:02,121
(So Min and Se Chan are coming soon.)

2089
01:23:02,388 --> 01:23:04,290
(And next week)

2090
01:23:05,024 --> 01:23:08,694
(It's a dangerous tourist spot you must visit before you die.)

2091
01:23:09,328 --> 01:23:10,963
(Global Race)

2092
01:23:11,597 --> 01:23:12,898
(New experience)

2093
01:23:12,898 --> 01:23:14,466
(New chemistry)

2094
01:23:14,466 --> 01:23:16,535
(Next week, the new Running Man will be coming.)
