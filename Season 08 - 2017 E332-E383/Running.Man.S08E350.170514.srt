(Three Tour Stickers will earn them a trip to the tourist attraction.)

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,400
Haha and Se Chan!

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,710
(The war of Tour Stickers gets fiercer and fiercer.)

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,670
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo are piling up the stickers.)

14
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,600
(Today, even more Tour Stickers will pour out.)

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,370
(Who will be sent on the dangerous trip?)

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,670
(Ulsan is an important port for the Korean industry...)

17
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,267
(and is a hot place for whale-watching.)

18
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:54,333
- Hello. - Hello.

19
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,373
(10am, Jangsaengpo Portï»¿, Ulsan)

20
00:00:55,373 --> 00:00:57,903
- We're in Ulsan. - Yes.

21
00:00:58,003 --> 00:01:00,073
This is the second part of...

22
00:01:00,073 --> 00:01:03,503
Global Project Part Five, Dangerous Choices.

23
00:01:03,503 --> 00:01:06,003
(By the way,)

24
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:08,633
(where are Seok Jin and Kwang Soo?)

25
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:14,003
Before they got on the ferry, Seok Jin and Kwang Soo...

26
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:16,903
did something in relation to today's mission.

27
00:01:16,903 --> 00:01:20,543
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo received a mission?)

28
00:01:20,543 --> 00:01:25,403
They had to guess whether they'd spot dolphins or not.

29
00:01:25,403 --> 00:01:29,403
(They had to guess.)

30
00:01:29,603 --> 00:01:31,533
That was it.

31
00:01:31,703 --> 00:01:34,373
If their choice was right,

32
00:01:34,373 --> 00:01:36,803
they'll be given five dollars.

33
00:01:36,803 --> 00:01:39,203
(If Seok Jin and Kwang Soo's choice is right, they get 5 dollars.)

34
00:01:39,373 --> 00:01:40,673
They get five dollars?

35
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,833
I'll provide you the same situation.

36
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:48,233
Choose if Seok Jin and Kwang Soo got to watch the dolphins or not.

37
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,133
(Did they get to watch the dolphins or not?)

38
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:57,073
(5 hours before the shoot at Jangsaengpo Port)

39
00:01:57,073 --> 00:02:00,273
(It's the beginning of their mission to watch dolphins.)

40
00:02:00,273 --> 00:02:01,373
Good morning.

41
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:03,403
Hi. Hello.

42
00:02:04,273 --> 00:02:06,233
What did Kwang Soo do to deserve this?

43
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:07,903
(He's here only because Seok Jin chose him.)

44
00:02:07,943 --> 00:02:11,073
Currently, Seok Jin already has three Tour Stickers.

45
00:02:11,073 --> 00:02:12,373
- Already? - Right.

46
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:14,233
Kwang Soo, you have two.

47
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:15,603
It's not fair for me.

48
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,173
- I came here because of you. - I'm sorry.

49
00:02:18,173 --> 00:02:21,203
I may end up getting a penalty because of you.

50
00:02:21,203 --> 00:02:23,103
- You're ruining my life now. - Hey.

51
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:26,133
Before we move on, let's guess how the results will turn out.

52
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:30,673
If you succeed in guessing, you get five dollars.

53
00:02:30,673 --> 00:02:31,973
- Whether we'll see dolphins? - Yes.

54
00:02:31,973 --> 00:02:33,303
We won't be able to.

55
00:02:33,873 --> 00:02:34,903
(What?)

56
00:02:34,903 --> 00:02:36,133
We need to be realistic on this.

57
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:38,833
- I choose that we'll be able to. - If it happens, I'll get...

58
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,303
- the money and the penalty too. - Look.

59
00:02:40,303 --> 00:02:41,833
(He'll be getting the penalty.)

60
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,833
(Even if he sees dolphins, his life seems so miserable.)

61
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,573
- What's good for me then? - You...

62
00:02:46,573 --> 00:02:48,733
It'll be just taking the ship for no reason.

63
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:51,373
- If we don't get to see dolphins... - I'm pretty sure we won't.

64
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:53,673
I'll just choose that we'll see them.

65
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:56,473
- Both of you did your bet. - All right.

66
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:57,933
I need to see them no matter what.

67
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:00,703
(After 1 hour)

68
00:03:00,703 --> 00:03:02,473
- There are the dolphins! - Yes!

69
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:06,033
(They face a pod of dolphins.)

70
00:03:06,373 --> 00:03:07,903
- Look. - Come back!

71
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:09,773
- They're right in front of us. - Hey!

72
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:15,703
(The miracle of nature made them forget about the mission.)

73
00:03:15,703 --> 00:03:17,333
My gosh, it's amazing.

74
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,003
- It doesn't make sense. - It's crazy.

75
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:21,733
(Dance with the dolphins.)

76
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:24,233
- My gosh. - This is really happening now.

77
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:25,733
It's real.

78
00:03:25,903 --> 00:03:31,733
(The dolphins don't seem to care at all about their going crazy.)

79
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,833
- Don't shoot me! - There they are!

80
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,703
You need to capture them with your cameras!

81
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:38,973
- Hey, film them! - Not me! I'm just a mere person.

82
00:03:38,973 --> 00:03:41,203
- They're right in front of us! - They're following us!

83
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:43,903
- You can't remain calm about this. - Everyone!

84
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:46,203
I'm witnessing the horrible... I mean,

85
00:03:46,203 --> 00:03:48,373
- the magnificent moment now! - It's happening now.

86
00:03:49,073 --> 00:03:52,533
Due to the time limit, we will finish the tour here...

87
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:54,873
and move back to the port now.

88
00:03:54,873 --> 00:03:56,673
- What? - No way!

89
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,903
- What? - Not a chance!

90
00:03:58,903 --> 00:04:02,503
(They said goodbye to the dolphins and moved back to the port.)

91
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:04,203
I'm pretty sure I was a dolphin in my past life.

92
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,273
(I'll be back, my dolphin friends.)

93
00:04:05,273 --> 00:04:07,573
- I'll announce the results now. - Okay!

94
00:04:07,603 --> 00:04:09,273
Seok Jin and Kwang Soo.

95
00:04:10,003 --> 00:04:13,373
You saw the dolphins despite the low possibility.

96
00:04:14,073 --> 00:04:16,273
(They came, they watched, and they completed the mission.)

97
00:04:16,273 --> 00:04:18,603
Our hard work paid off.

98
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:22,273
- Right! - Dolphins!

99
00:04:22,373 --> 00:04:25,333
You each acquired the No Tour Card...

100
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,533
and five dollars for the mission.

101
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,133
(They acquired 5 dollars each along with the No Tour Card.)

102
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:32,403
You need to keep this to yourselves when you join the members.

103
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:34,603
(Now, it's time for the members to guess what happened.)

104
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,933
How should I fix my face expression? Should I be upset?

105
00:04:38,743 --> 00:04:40,903
You can't look disappointed, you know.

106
00:04:41,273 --> 00:04:42,973
Let's just be expressionless.

107
00:04:42,973 --> 00:04:44,803
(They need to fool the other members.)

108
00:04:44,803 --> 00:04:46,003
What do you plan to do?

109
00:04:46,173 --> 00:04:47,273
I...

110
00:04:47,273 --> 00:04:49,603
(They're known to be horrible actors.)

111
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:51,603
I should just stare into the abyss like this.

112
00:04:51,603 --> 00:04:53,273
- How about we just be all excited? - What?

113
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:57,473
(If you're not confident in acting, just be yourself.)

114
00:04:57,473 --> 00:04:58,603
That'd be weird too.

115
00:04:59,073 --> 00:05:00,373
- Either way would be weird. - Well...

116
00:05:00,373 --> 00:05:02,273
- I can't just lie. - You know,

117
00:05:02,573 --> 00:05:04,603
we're just not good at...

118
00:05:04,873 --> 00:05:06,503
fooling others.

119
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,403
I'll bet my five dollars on not being able to fool them.

120
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:12,303
I'll bet my entire fortune on it.

121
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:14,303
They'll find out for certain.

122
00:05:14,303 --> 00:05:16,403
- I'm sure. - I'll bet my Tour Sticker on it.

123
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:18,473
(The duo arrives, being certain of failing the mission.)

124
00:05:18,473 --> 00:05:21,073
- Thank you. - Thank you.

125
00:05:21,743 --> 00:05:25,003
From now on, you need to do whatever it takes...

126
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:27,033
to fool them.

127
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:28,903
- How does my face look now? - Your face?

128
00:05:28,903 --> 00:05:30,033
(I do...)

129
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:32,433
(have a secret.)

130
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,103
You're making it too obvious.

131
00:05:34,103 --> 00:05:36,103
(I'm sorry, but everyone will know you're acting.)

132
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:37,803
- Is it okay? - You look like you're acting.

133
00:05:39,003 --> 00:05:41,173
You're making it too obvious.

134
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:42,303
Should I be natural?

135
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:44,733
That's it. That's the right look.

136
00:05:45,903 --> 00:05:47,303
- There they are. - They're...

137
00:05:47,303 --> 00:05:48,933
(Will they successfully fool the others?)

138
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,933
(At the same time)

139
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:56,333
Choose if Seok Jin and Kwang Soo got to watch the dolphins or not.

140
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,433
We'll provide you with five dollars each if your decision is correct.

141
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:01,473
(They get 5 dollars for guessing it right.)

142
00:06:01,473 --> 00:06:03,673
- I think the dolphins came out. - Me too.

143
00:06:03,673 --> 00:06:06,033
But it was too early. Dolphins sleep at night too.

144
00:06:07,373 --> 00:06:11,103
(Will they be able to acquire the money?)

145
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:12,533
They're here.

146
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,573
(The dolphin duo is back, pretending not to know.)

147
00:06:14,603 --> 00:06:16,873
- What happened? - Did you see them?

148
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:19,173
- They must've gone through much. - They seem bright.

149
00:06:19,673 --> 00:06:21,933
I don't think they got a Sticker. I think they saw the dolphins.

150
00:06:22,203 --> 00:06:23,833
Am I being natural now?

151
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,603
(We're not being obvious, right?)

152
00:06:25,603 --> 00:06:27,333
- Right? - We're natural enough.

153
00:06:27,773 --> 00:06:29,933
They're walking confidently.

154
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:31,333
They must have seen them.

155
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,773
Seok Jin's footsteps are light.

156
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:34,433
You'll say you saw them, right?

157
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:35,873
Yes, I will.

158
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:37,773
- What happened? - Did you see them?

159
00:06:37,973 --> 00:06:39,573
- They don't look bright. - They look depressed.

160
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:41,333
- We saw them. - What?

161
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:43,033
- We did. - We saw them.

162
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:44,233
You're lying.

163
00:06:44,373 --> 00:06:46,233
- We really did. - Don't lie.

164
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:48,073
Did you take pictures?

165
00:06:48,173 --> 00:06:49,573
You need to prove us.

166
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:51,603
- Of course, we did. - Is that right?

167
00:06:51,603 --> 00:06:53,573
That was an amazing experience.

168
00:06:53,573 --> 00:06:55,673
- What was? - We took pictures.

169
00:06:55,673 --> 00:06:58,503
(They sound like they saw the dolphins, but they look awkward.)

170
00:06:58,503 --> 00:06:59,973
How did the dolphins look?

171
00:06:59,973 --> 00:07:01,903
- They're unbelievable. - You wouldn't believe it.

172
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:04,873
- They were long. - As long as that ship.

173
00:07:04,873 --> 00:07:07,203
You wouldn't have been able to see their whole body.

174
00:07:07,203 --> 00:07:08,533
They jumped.

175
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:10,003
- They jumped? - So you didn't see them.

176
00:07:10,003 --> 00:07:11,133
Were they bouncing on a trampoline or what?

177
00:07:11,273 --> 00:07:13,473
- I did. - I saw at least 3,000 of them.

178
00:07:13,473 --> 00:07:14,773
No way.

179
00:07:14,773 --> 00:07:17,803
Your acting is awful now.

180
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:19,503
(You must've forgotten, but I'm an actor.)

181
00:07:19,903 --> 00:07:21,073
You must be...

182
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,803
- in good condition today. - I actually am.

183
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:27,603
(Right when Kwang Soo's acting skills are brought up...)

184
00:07:27,603 --> 00:07:30,173
What color were they?

185
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:32,873
(All of a sudden)

186
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:34,003
(They all have the same color.)

187
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:35,533
Are you sure your question was sharp?

188
00:07:36,003 --> 00:07:38,773
So Min is stressing us out.

189
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:40,433
I've been watching her until now,

190
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:42,673
and she keeps having suspicions on everything.

191
00:07:43,173 --> 00:07:44,473
(In alert)

192
00:07:45,973 --> 00:07:47,103
(20 minutes before the shoot)

193
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,573
(Tap)

194
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,603
(Glancing)

195
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:53,833
(Is there a secret mission?)

196
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,833
I guess you're tapping me for a reason.

197
00:07:57,303 --> 00:07:59,503
- Is it not? - Are you suspicious?

198
00:07:59,503 --> 00:08:00,533
(On guard)

199
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:03,873
(She's focused too much on Running Man.)

200
00:08:03,973 --> 00:08:05,373
I tried to help her with the mic, and she went like this.

201
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:08,433
(Here's another tip-off.)

202
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:11,233
- Yesterday as well. - While I was on the phone...

203
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:13,173
with Se Chan, she suddenly cut in and suspected if it was me.

204
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:15,503
"I think you're not." And I said I'm Kwang Soo.

205
00:08:15,503 --> 00:08:17,173
- And she wanted me to swear. - She wanted to talk to him.

206
00:08:17,173 --> 00:08:18,803
- She told me to swear. - Why would you want him to swear?

207
00:08:18,803 --> 00:08:21,733
(I said I'm right!)

208
00:08:23,173 --> 00:08:26,033
Then she asked why I swore at her.

209
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:27,873
But she told me to swear.

210
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:30,333
- It really happened. - It's true.

211
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,703
- Really. - So Min is weird.

212
00:08:32,703 --> 00:08:34,733
- She is not ordinary. - You're right.

213
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:35,903
I don't understand her.

214
00:08:35,903 --> 00:08:38,133
Well, is our opening going to be longer today?

215
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:39,803
- Why? - I'm a bit tired.

216
00:08:39,903 --> 00:08:42,233
- Make sure you prepare... - I'm exhausted.

217
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:43,703
a stretcher to carry him.

218
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:45,703
I'm going crazy now.

219
00:08:46,073 --> 00:08:49,073
His mouth is going very dry.

220
00:08:49,073 --> 00:08:50,133
(Pale)

221
00:08:50,843 --> 00:08:52,773
I was fortunate to watch those dolphins though.

222
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:55,073
(Very unnatural)

223
00:08:55,073 --> 00:08:56,173
(What is he saying?)

224
00:08:56,173 --> 00:08:57,803
I was fortunate to watch those dolphins though.

225
00:08:58,573 --> 00:09:01,573
- That is strange. - So you didn't see them.

226
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:03,703
(They become sure that they didn't get to see the dolphins.)

227
00:09:03,703 --> 00:09:05,733
(Is he trying to pull a trick?)

228
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:07,773
- He saw it. - He did.

229
00:09:08,303 --> 00:09:10,673
- He did. - He's just making it not natural.

230
00:09:10,903 --> 00:09:12,273
- They did. - Was it too obvious?

231
00:09:12,273 --> 00:09:13,373
(I'm sorry.)

232
00:09:13,373 --> 00:09:15,303
He shouldn't have said things like that.

233
00:09:15,503 --> 00:09:16,673
(This guy is such a trouble maker.)

234
00:09:16,673 --> 00:09:17,843
Was it obvious?

235
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:20,303
How should we decide?

236
00:09:20,303 --> 00:09:23,733
Just take turns in saying you choose whether they saw or not.

237
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:26,373
For your information, the money is very important for today's mission.

238
00:09:26,843 --> 00:09:30,843
(The money will be an important variable for today's race.)

239
00:09:31,473 --> 00:09:33,773
I'll go first. They saw the dolphins!

240
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:36,473
I know Seok Jin and Kwang Soo too much.

241
00:09:36,473 --> 00:09:37,673
I choose they didn't succeed.

242
00:09:37,673 --> 00:09:39,533
- They succeeded. - They did.

243
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:41,503
I knew from the beginning.

244
00:09:41,503 --> 00:09:42,703
- What? - They succeeded.

245
00:09:42,703 --> 00:09:44,773
- They didn't. - The two women chose differently.

246
00:09:44,773 --> 00:09:46,603
- All men chose... - They chose that the two saw it.

247
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:50,003
(They have finished choosing whether the two succeeded in the mission.)

248
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:51,873
I'll reveal the answer now.

249
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:54,503
We got aboard the ship at 5am.

250
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:57,973
The captain commented they might see the dolphins...

251
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,033
as the weather and the waves were nice.

252
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:04,803
In fact, the possibility was only 20 percent, so we took an hour...

253
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:07,203
- to wait for the dolphins. - Can I change?

254
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,103
You can change your decision.

255
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:11,603
- Can you change now? - Let's have a final time to think.

256
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:12,873
Okay, this is your last chance.

257
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:14,873
(It's their last chance to choose.)

258
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:16,133
- Will you change? - Will you?

259
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:17,673
- You should change. - Do it.

260
00:10:17,673 --> 00:10:20,733
(Thinking carefully, I realized the possibility is very low.)

261
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:22,403
Change it while you're at it.

262
00:10:23,343 --> 00:10:25,233
(What is Jae Seok's decision?)

263
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:26,873
They succeeded.

264
00:10:28,843 --> 00:10:31,373
- What? - What was all that for?

265
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:33,173
- What's wrong? - It's such a waste of time.

266
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:34,873
Why would you waste the tapes?

267
00:10:34,873 --> 00:10:37,073
- You spoiled the mood. - Seriously.

268
00:10:37,073 --> 00:10:39,073
Why don't you go further? Spoil it even more.

269
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:41,133
- What was that for? - It took us an hour.

270
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:45,703
I don't care what you choose. Just finish it quickly.

271
00:10:46,503 --> 00:10:47,973
(I can't stand this anymore.)

272
00:10:47,973 --> 00:10:50,133
Did you sing at a karaoke room last night?

273
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:53,473
Tell us whether you saw the dolphins or not.

274
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:56,233
Tell us whether you saw the dolphins or not.

275
00:10:56,773 --> 00:10:58,573
(Well)

276
00:10:58,573 --> 00:11:00,473
I'll give you one last chance.

277
00:11:02,273 --> 00:11:04,203
- That makes us certain. - That's it.

278
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:05,833
- There we go. - They saw it.

279
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,973
(That made us clear.)

280
00:11:06,973 --> 00:11:08,703
I told you they're bad at acting.

281
00:11:08,703 --> 00:11:10,373
I'm now 100 percent sure of it.

282
00:11:10,373 --> 00:11:11,573
I will tell you.

283
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:14,073
They saw the dolphins.

284
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:16,303
They saw the dolphins.

285
00:11:16,303 --> 00:11:20,133
(The two girls failed in guessing.)

286
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:21,733
- Okay. - I told you.

287
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:23,073
- Yes. - We were right.

288
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:24,873
(They're envious.)

289
00:11:25,003 --> 00:11:27,003
- It was just amazing. - So you saw the dolphins.

290
00:11:27,003 --> 00:11:28,373
I shouted too much that my voice is gone.

291
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:30,433
(They still can't believe they encountered them.)

292
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:33,233
- I'm so jealous. - It wasn't just one dolphin.

293
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,903
Thus, except for So Min and Ji Hyo,

294
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,333
the members will take five dollars each.

295
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,303
(The male members gain 5 dollars.)

296
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:41,933
If Kwang Soo didn't say the last thing,

297
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:44,303
- I fell for Jae Seok's trick. - I was going to change my guess.

298
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,403
Right.

299
00:11:46,103 --> 00:11:47,803
Here are the rules for today.

300
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:51,873
Today's race is called Dangerous Choices Part Two.

301
00:11:52,273 --> 00:11:55,003
The project for choosing a dangerous tourist attraction...

302
00:11:55,003 --> 00:11:57,633
that you want to go to before you die will be over today.

303
00:11:57,803 --> 00:11:59,933
- We just need to survive today. - Is that so?

304
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:01,373
Let's do a lot today.

305
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:05,033
As the last day, many Tour Stickers will be given out today.

306
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:06,173
My goodness.

307
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:07,273
Who wants to come with me?

308
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:09,033
- You should go over there. - I must go.

309
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:10,633
- Kwang Soo should go too. - Not me.

310
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:12,903
- You have two stickers. - Jae Seok should go too.

311
00:12:12,903 --> 00:12:15,233
I only have one. We don't know how it will turn out.

312
00:12:15,303 --> 00:12:17,103
- Haha is at risk. - I only have one.

313
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,673
Seok Jin is definitely going, right?

314
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,303
He should get some rest instead.

315
00:12:21,303 --> 00:12:23,273
(He tries to be considerate.)

316
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:25,333
- We'll call him later. - Right.

317
00:12:25,403 --> 00:12:27,203
However, we don't know what will happen.

318
00:12:27,203 --> 00:12:28,573
He might go on two tours.

319
00:12:29,303 --> 00:12:31,133
During each mission,

320
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:34,973
you may gain or lose the mission fee depending on your choice.

321
00:12:34,973 --> 00:12:37,403
With the final mission fee you have,

322
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:41,003
you may buy Tour Stickers or Reflecting Cards.

323
00:12:41,003 --> 00:12:44,003
(It's possible to buy these two.)

324
00:12:44,003 --> 00:12:47,433
(Will that be a chance to turn the tables?)

325
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:51,473
You can put the Sticker on another member to change their final fate.

326
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:53,333
(You can stick it on another member.)

327
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,333
You can give it to someone.

328
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,673
- After buying it? - You can give it to someone.

329
00:12:56,673 --> 00:12:58,503
(Who will get the last laugh?)

330
00:12:59,273 --> 00:13:03,633
(Gain mission fees to have the power to change who goes to the tour.)

331
00:13:04,673 --> 00:13:10,373
(With more money, you can buy more Tour Stickers and Reflecting Cards.)

332
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,903
I will make it happen.

333
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:15,573
(Buy Tour Stickers and send others on a dangerous tour.)

334
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:19,973
Here's the first mission where you can earn your mission fee.

335
00:13:20,273 --> 00:13:22,333
It's called Dangerous Wallets.

336
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,233
- What's that? - Do we choose wallets?

337
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:27,673
Among Running Man staff members,

338
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:31,203
pick one person who you think has the most cash.

339
00:13:31,203 --> 00:13:34,033
Ask for his or her wallet.

340
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:38,333
We'll give you the same amount of money as the amount of cash...

341
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,973
- in the wallet. - Is Director Park Chan Hee here?

342
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:43,273
I choose Director Ha.

343
00:13:43,273 --> 00:13:44,273
(They look for rich-looking staff.)

344
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:45,533
- By the way, - I choose Director Ha.

345
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,233
people don't carry much cash these days.

346
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:49,503
(It won't be easy to find cash.)

347
00:13:50,673 --> 00:13:54,873
(Who will have the most cash in their wallet?)

348
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:56,303
Wait a minute.

349
00:13:56,673 --> 00:13:59,373
Director Ha, do you only have your card?

350
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,573
I bet that's the case.

351
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:03,373
Do cameramen have cash on them?

352
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:04,873
- I don't think so. - I'm just asking.

353
00:14:04,873 --> 00:14:07,603
Cameramen could easily drop their wallets.

354
00:14:07,603 --> 00:14:09,133
- They wouldn't carry cash. - That's true.

355
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:10,303
I bet they only have their cards.

356
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:14,503
Kwon Ryeol doesn't bring any cash on the day of the shoot.

357
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:15,503
Gi Jin, do you have cash?

358
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:19,373
I've seen him carry cash before.

359
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:21,373
Do you have some cash?

360
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:22,403
(Who has the most cash?)

361
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,203
Do you have cash?

362
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,603
Everyone looks so poor today.

363
00:14:28,773 --> 00:14:30,403
Everyone looks so poor today.

364
00:14:31,803 --> 00:14:33,433
(Everyone seems broke.)

365
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:34,573
Goodness.

366
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,573
Everyone seems broke today.

367
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:37,773
How about you?

368
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:41,103
Do you have cash? I know who.

369
00:14:41,103 --> 00:14:43,873
Wait, who is managing the production fee?

370
00:14:43,873 --> 00:14:44,973
Here he is.

371
00:14:45,203 --> 00:14:46,373
Ju Yong.

372
00:14:46,373 --> 00:14:49,473
(The manager of production fee must have a lot of cash.)

373
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:51,903
(Lee Ju Yong)

374
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,203
I picked him.

375
00:14:53,203 --> 00:14:54,233
There he is.

376
00:14:55,073 --> 00:14:56,633
Ju Yong should have a lot of cash.

377
00:14:56,973 --> 00:15:00,533
Gosh, I see many 50-dollar bills.

378
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:02,973
Hyung Min, do you have your wallet?

379
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,103
May I borrow it?

380
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,303
(Park Hyung Min)

381
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:09,203
Director Ha, give it to me.

382
00:15:09,473 --> 00:15:11,733
- It's thick. I'll give it back. - He only has cards.

383
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:13,073
Give it to me, please.

384
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:16,733
- That bag is expensive. - No.

385
00:15:16,903 --> 00:15:17,903
Give me your bag.

386
00:15:17,903 --> 00:15:19,303
- May I borrow your wallet? - You'll regret it.

387
00:15:19,303 --> 00:15:20,303
That's fine.

388
00:15:21,273 --> 00:15:23,303
It's okay. This is good enough.

389
00:15:23,473 --> 00:15:24,633
May I borrow your wallet?

390
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:27,633
(Se Chan takes an assistant director's wallet.)

391
00:15:29,173 --> 00:15:30,473
I must find a good one.

392
00:15:30,473 --> 00:15:31,933
(Jae Seok takes time.)

393
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:33,933
People don't carry cash these days.

394
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,633
What about Yu Ri?

395
00:15:36,273 --> 00:15:37,503
This is difficult.

396
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,603
I don't know what to do.

397
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:42,303
Someone unexpected may have a lot of cash.

398
00:15:42,303 --> 00:15:44,233
(He ponders as he walks around.)

399
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:45,403
Wait a minute.

400
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,573
(While he's still confused...)

401
00:15:47,703 --> 00:15:48,733
What?

402
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:51,603
(A staff member hands him his wallet.)

403
00:15:51,603 --> 00:15:53,103
Were you waiting to give it to me?

404
00:15:53,103 --> 00:15:54,703
(Is this a trap?)

405
00:15:54,873 --> 00:15:58,303
(He voluntarily hands him his wallet.)

406
00:15:58,303 --> 00:16:00,433
(Jae Seok is confused.)

407
00:16:01,073 --> 00:16:02,073
Really?

408
00:16:02,603 --> 00:16:04,433
(Is this a trap?)

409
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,073
He's telling me to trust him.

410
00:16:07,673 --> 00:16:09,803
Okay, I choose this wallet.

411
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,303
This is crucial.

412
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:13,633
Let's check Haha's first.

413
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,633
- Let's take a look. - You never know.

414
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:19,033
The wallet looks empty.

415
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:23,403
(Show us your power, Director Ha.)

416
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:26,303
My goodness.

417
00:16:26,303 --> 00:16:30,873
(How much cash is in the wallet?)

418
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:34,803
(Haha screams.)

419
00:16:34,803 --> 00:16:37,833
(It's full of cash.)

420
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:42,603
(Director Ha is rich after all.)

421
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:44,003
He has a lot.

422
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,503
You're the most successful man in the Ha family.

423
00:16:45,503 --> 00:16:47,633
(Haha is impressed.)

424
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,273
That's a lot.

425
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:50,833
That's amazing.

426
00:16:51,903 --> 00:16:53,733
I never expected it.

427
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:55,433
Do you carry all of your money?

428
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,873
You do, don't you?

429
00:16:57,873 --> 00:16:59,903
- He carries all of his money. - It's 16,

430
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,933
- 17, 18, 19, and 20. - Wait.

431
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:04,403
- 21, 22, 23, and 24. - No way.

432
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:06,503
- 1, 2, and 3. - I knew it.

433
00:17:06,603 --> 00:17:08,573
Older people carry more cash.

434
00:17:08,573 --> 00:17:10,933
(Haha gets 247 dollars.)

435
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:12,273
- This is... - That's unfair.

436
00:17:12,273 --> 00:17:13,833
the power of the Ha family!

437
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,873
(This is the power of the Ha family.)

438
00:17:17,543 --> 00:17:19,073
Next up is Se Chan.

439
00:17:19,273 --> 00:17:22,833
- He picked So Yeon's wallet. - I have So Yeon's wallet.

440
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,543
(He takes a look inside her wallet.)

441
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:26,603
The wallet looks expensive.

442
00:17:26,773 --> 00:17:28,403
- Wait. - It's expensive.

443
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,703
She often shops at department stores.

444
00:17:31,703 --> 00:17:34,373
- Does she have many cards? - It's an expensive brand.

445
00:17:34,673 --> 00:17:36,543
It's an expensive brand.

446
00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:40,543
- She has no cash. - No.

447
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:42,833
(Is there any cash at all?)

448
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,043
Is there any cash?

449
00:17:44,503 --> 00:17:45,803
She doesn't even have 10 cents.

450
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:48,003
It's completely empty.

451
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:49,733
This is the worst.

452
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:51,303
It's the last leaf.

453
00:17:52,373 --> 00:17:56,173
(Empty wallets look sophisticated.)

454
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:58,403
Se Chan gets zero mission fee.

455
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:00,973
Whose wallet do you have?

456
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:02,573
- He's so unlucky. - I have...

457
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:05,403
- Writer Yu Ri's wallet. - Yu Ri?

458
00:18:05,403 --> 00:18:06,973
She has 30 dollars.

459
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:09,173
- It's 30 dollars. - It's something at least.

460
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,173
- How about So Min? - Whose wallet do you have?

461
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,273
I have Ju Yong's wallet.

462
00:18:13,273 --> 00:18:16,003
He always pays for our meals.

463
00:18:16,003 --> 00:18:18,933
- It's 17 and 18. - Gosh, So Min.

464
00:18:19,203 --> 00:18:21,603
- I finally have a match. - It's 1, 2, 3,

465
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:23,633
- and four. - Let's spend a lot today.

466
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:25,303
It's 184 dollars.

467
00:18:26,603 --> 00:18:28,503
- I have a cameraman's wallet. - Who is it?

468
00:18:29,003 --> 00:18:30,303
- Gi Jin. - Gi Jin.

469
00:18:30,303 --> 00:18:31,433
He has a lot of cash.

470
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:33,633
- I didn't expect much. - How much does he have?

471
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:35,543
There's a 50-dollar bill.

472
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:36,773
It's 80 dollars.

473
00:18:36,773 --> 00:18:38,703
(Jong Kook gets 80 dollars.)

474
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:40,173
Everyone knows who she is.

475
00:18:40,173 --> 00:18:42,373
She is the beauty among our staff members.

476
00:18:42,373 --> 00:18:44,973
- She's in charge of marketing. - Right.

477
00:18:44,973 --> 00:18:46,333
I have her wallet.

478
00:18:47,203 --> 00:18:48,673
That's a nice wallet.

479
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,303
It's a wallet you'd find in Gangnam.

480
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:52,803
Usually, long wallets have cash in them.

481
00:18:53,303 --> 00:18:55,073
This wallet is the best one of all.

482
00:18:55,173 --> 00:18:58,303
- This has to have cash in it. - Absolutely.

483
00:18:58,573 --> 00:18:59,573
I have high hopes.

484
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,543
I hope it only has cards.

485
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:02,873
I'm nervous.

486
00:19:04,303 --> 00:19:05,703
What's wrong? Is it thin?

487
00:19:05,973 --> 00:19:07,233
- Is it just the leather? - First of all,

488
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,103
I saw something yellow which was a parking ticket.

489
00:19:09,103 --> 00:19:11,833
(He saw something yellow which was a parking ticket.)

490
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,103
- That means she drives her car. - Are there checks?

491
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:15,133
She drives a car.

492
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:16,803
- Hurry up. - Is there anything on the back?

493
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:18,373
How dare she...

494
00:19:18,373 --> 00:19:20,003
(Seok Jin gets angry.)

495
00:19:20,003 --> 00:19:21,303
(He feels bitter and betrayed.)

496
00:19:21,303 --> 00:19:22,473
Let me see.

497
00:19:22,473 --> 00:19:23,873
There's no cash.

498
00:19:23,973 --> 00:19:25,903
- There's no cash at all? - No.

499
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:27,673
- Wait. - There's nothing at all?

500
00:19:27,773 --> 00:19:29,043
- How about on the back? - Take a look.

501
00:19:29,173 --> 00:19:31,043
(It's a point card.)

502
00:19:31,043 --> 00:19:34,103
The wallet is the only thing that is fancy.

503
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:36,433
(Today's lesson is empty wallets only look fancy.)

504
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:38,543
She looked so sophisticated.

505
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:40,803
How could you have no cash?

506
00:19:40,803 --> 00:19:42,573
Seok Jin gets zero mission fee.

507
00:19:42,573 --> 00:19:43,733
Are there any 10-dollar bills?

508
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:45,733
- He gets nothing. - Goodness.

509
00:19:46,003 --> 00:19:49,473
- I can't believe there's no cash. - He's unlucky after all.

510
00:19:49,673 --> 00:19:51,633
- Gosh. - He's you in 10 years.

511
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:53,633
- Seriously. - He's me in 10 years?

512
00:19:53,633 --> 00:19:55,803
- I can't believe there's no cash. - He's unlucky after all.

513
00:19:57,133 --> 00:19:59,203
- How about you, Kwang Soo? - I'm quite hopeful.

514
00:19:59,203 --> 00:20:01,873
He's working as a manager,

515
00:20:01,973 --> 00:20:04,173
- but he has his own business. - Business?

516
00:20:04,173 --> 00:20:06,433
It's Hyung Min, Seok Jin's manager.

517
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:08,603
- Why him? - You can't choose his manager.

518
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:09,773
He's one of the staff members.

519
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:12,573
Hyung Min's main occupation isn't being Seok Jin's manager.

520
00:20:12,573 --> 00:20:15,433
- This is his part-time job. - That's right.

521
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:18,173
Seok Jin's manager has more money than Seok Jin.

522
00:20:18,473 --> 00:20:20,133
- Let's see. - Okay.

523
00:20:20,873 --> 00:20:21,873
Here's his wallet.

524
00:20:22,273 --> 00:20:25,173
The wallet looks like it belongs to someone poor.

525
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:27,003
- There's some cash in it. - There it is.

526
00:20:27,803 --> 00:20:29,233
- There's a lot. - It's a lot.

527
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:31,103
You got lucky, Kwang Soo.

528
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,733
That's so little cash for someone who has his own business.

529
00:20:34,003 --> 00:20:35,573
It's not 10 but 9 dollars.

530
00:20:35,573 --> 00:20:36,903
(He finds 9 dollars.)

531
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,703
- Wait. - Is that his wallet?

532
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:39,703
Isn't this yours?

533
00:20:40,203 --> 00:20:41,733
It's my wallet.

534
00:20:44,103 --> 00:20:46,473
Why did you give me poor Seok Jin's wallet instead of yours?

535
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:49,833
(Why did you give me someone else's wallet?)

536
00:20:50,003 --> 00:20:51,633
- Where did he go? - It's my wallet.

537
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:53,603
It turned out to be my wallet.

538
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:55,733
Finally, it's me.

539
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:59,633
He voluntarily offered his wallet to me.

540
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,903
That's crazy.

541
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:10,273
(A man offered his wallet to Jae Seok without being asked.)

542
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:15,733
(Jae Seok took the wallet.)

543
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:22,003
(He also offered his wallet to other members.)

544
00:21:22,003 --> 00:21:26,543
(Was he simply being generous?)

545
00:21:27,403 --> 00:21:29,003
Is there a lot of cash?

546
00:21:29,003 --> 00:21:30,543
- Are they any? - That's not fair.

547
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:32,803
(The Pandora's box is opened.)

548
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,073
- That's a lot of cash. - No way.

549
00:21:35,073 --> 00:21:36,573
- It's a lot of cash. - That's unfair.

550
00:21:37,703 --> 00:21:39,233
Goodness. There are a lot. How much is this?

551
00:21:39,543 --> 00:21:40,633
- This... - Look.

552
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,173
- This is getting annoying now. - Give it to me.

553
00:21:43,203 --> 00:21:44,403
Oh, my.

554
00:21:44,633 --> 00:21:46,073
You can't do that.

555
00:21:46,603 --> 00:21:48,603
- Poor Se Chan. - Se Chan.

556
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:51,103
- This is so annoying. I mean it. - 50, 60, 70,

557
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:52,733
80, 90, and 100.

558
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:56,533
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,

559
00:21:56,903 --> 00:21:58,603
- It's 191 dollars. - It's 190 dollars.

560
00:21:59,273 --> 00:22:00,803
- 191 dollars. - What was it?

561
00:22:00,803 --> 00:22:01,803
(I'm sorry that I have doubted you.)

562
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,133
(Status of mission fees)

563
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:08,233
Before we start our mission,

564
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:12,003
please freely make 2 teams of 4.

565
00:22:12,703 --> 00:22:13,903
(Freely?)

566
00:22:13,903 --> 00:22:15,933
- Freely? - Form your teams freely.

567
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:18,603
- People with money, come here. - All right. Wait.

568
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:21,233
(Trotting)

569
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:22,833
People who have money should be in my team.

570
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,103
At least one of you should come to our team.

571
00:22:24,103 --> 00:22:25,533
- Hey, let me join your team. - We should...

572
00:22:26,073 --> 00:22:28,073
(Everyone is trying to get the rich members into their team.)

573
00:22:28,073 --> 00:22:29,833
- Seok Jin, how much do you have? - Me?

574
00:22:30,703 --> 00:22:32,303
I have five dollars.

575
00:22:33,273 --> 00:22:35,273
- How much do you have? - I have 180 dollars.

576
00:22:35,273 --> 00:22:37,333
- She has 180 dollars. - I have 14 dollars.

577
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:39,203
- Haha. So Min! - So Min!

578
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:41,033
- So Min, come here. - So Min, come here.

579
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:43,003
- So Min, come here. - So Min, come. This is your team.

580
00:22:43,003 --> 00:22:44,433
- So Min. - Come here.

581
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:46,433
- I really mean it. So Min. - They are unlucky. Come!

582
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:48,273
(Look out! They are unlucky.)

583
00:22:48,273 --> 00:22:50,203
- Come here quickly! - Then let me join you.

584
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,903
- No. Come quickly! - You will be unlucky too.

585
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,803
- Then let me join you. - No.

586
00:22:53,803 --> 00:22:55,633
No, we don't want you.

587
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:56,833
- Jae Seok, don't come to us. - Are you crazy?

588
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,703
- Hey! I have a lot of money. - Go away.

589
00:22:58,703 --> 00:23:00,533
- You will be unlucky too. - That was too harsh.

590
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:02,533
- Come before you get unlucky too. - How can you say that?

591
00:23:02,533 --> 00:23:04,433
- What's wrong with you? - Let go.

592
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:06,203
- What a harsh thing to say. - Let me join you.

593
00:23:06,203 --> 00:23:08,533
- So Min. Hurry! Don't be unlucky. - Don't join them!

594
00:23:08,603 --> 00:23:10,003
(It's best to avoid any unlucky members.)

595
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,803
- I can join your team. - No.

596
00:23:11,803 --> 00:23:14,203
- No, go away. - I have 10 more dollars.

597
00:23:14,203 --> 00:23:15,833
We don't want you. Don't touch us.

598
00:23:15,903 --> 00:23:17,933
- We were the team... - Come here.

599
00:23:17,933 --> 00:23:19,533
who'd survive the apocalypse.

600
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:20,633
(Don't you remember?)

601
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:25,133
(The team that will survive the apocalypse?)

602
00:23:27,003 --> 00:23:31,173
(Last time, it was confirmed that they were the chosen team.)

603
00:23:31,173 --> 00:23:34,903
(The remaining members were like cockroaches.)

604
00:23:35,173 --> 00:23:37,333
When we're together, don't we look like a tribe?

605
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,433
(The members of the tribe meet again unexpectedly.)

606
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:43,433
(The tribe of the squids is reunited again.)

607
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:45,233
- Hold on a second. - Couples surviving the destruction.

608
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:47,403
- This is going to be my team? - How much do you have?

609
00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:49,703
I have some money.

610
00:23:49,733 --> 00:23:51,603
- I really do have some money. - Hey.

611
00:23:51,603 --> 00:23:53,003
Don't you know me?

612
00:23:53,003 --> 00:23:55,773
- Wait. They don't have any money. - Do you have money?

613
00:23:55,803 --> 00:23:57,803
- Don't you know how much I have? - Hey, forget it.

614
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,673
Hey, don't regret later.

615
00:23:59,703 --> 00:24:01,803
- So Min. - You called us unlucky.

616
00:24:01,803 --> 00:24:03,733
- Seok Jin. Forget them. - Whatever.

617
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,533
- Fine. You, go ahead. - We will go then.

618
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:07,433
- Go! - What about you, Jae Seok?

619
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:09,803
(What? What about you?)

620
00:24:10,103 --> 00:24:12,633
- I'll be here. - Come here. Come, Jae Seok.

621
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:14,903
- You'd better come here. - Hey, I belong in that team.

622
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:16,373
- We don't have money. - Let go of me.

623
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:19,133
- This is still an individual game. - Yes, at the end, it will be.

624
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:20,803
- Can we switch teams later on? - Of course.

625
00:24:20,803 --> 00:24:22,333
- It can change. - All right.

626
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,533
I will take these poor members with me.

627
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:26,703
I am not poor. I am sort of in the middle.

628
00:24:26,703 --> 00:24:28,533
- What? You have 19 dollars. - 19 dollar.

629
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,433
- It's basically nothing. - What's wrong with 19 dollars?

630
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:31,903
So have you formed your teams?

631
00:24:32,073 --> 00:24:33,233
For now, yes.

632
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:35,933
The thing is that kids who have nothing to lose are scarier.

633
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,733
(Kids who have nothing to lose?)

634
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:40,073
- Nothing to lose? - Kids?

635
00:24:40,073 --> 00:24:41,703
- Did you call us kids? - What?

636
00:24:41,703 --> 00:24:43,903
It's just an expression.

637
00:24:43,903 --> 00:24:45,033
Let me start now.

638
00:24:45,033 --> 00:24:47,973
This mission is Dangerous 10 Seconds.

639
00:24:47,973 --> 00:24:49,833
(The 2nd round is Dangerous 10 Seconds.)

640
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,033
What is this now?

641
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:54,103
It's a 4-against-4 quiz. Please pick a member who will figure out...

642
00:24:54,103 --> 00:24:57,533
the answer after listening to only the first sentence of the quiz.

643
00:24:57,533 --> 00:24:59,233
- Only the first sentence? - I am good at solving quizzes.

644
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:00,433
Only the first sentence?

645
00:25:00,903 --> 00:25:02,003
I can't. I am not that fast.

646
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:06,473
When you figure out the correct answer, you'll receive 30 dollars.

647
00:25:06,473 --> 00:25:08,433
(The reward will be 30 dollars?)

648
00:25:08,703 --> 00:25:10,533
- Let's do this. - This is our chance.

649
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:12,803
- What a twist. - All the smart ones are here.

650
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:16,833
The member who gets the right answer can choose either...

651
00:25:16,903 --> 00:25:20,203
to end the mission after having the money to themselves...

652
00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:27,073
(The member can choose to end the mission and keep the money?)

653
00:25:27,073 --> 00:25:29,833
- Or they can share with... - This can't be right.

654
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:31,803
This is over. We are in the clear.

655
00:25:31,803 --> 00:25:32,973
(It's the best betraying environment.)

656
00:25:32,973 --> 00:25:35,203
In my team, they are all traitors.

657
00:25:35,203 --> 00:25:36,633
- My team... - No, don't say that.

658
00:25:36,633 --> 00:25:38,473
- Is it every man for himself? - Hey, don't be like that.

659
00:25:38,473 --> 00:25:40,803
The rule is that we are supposed to have the money to ourselves.

660
00:25:40,803 --> 00:25:42,473
- Is that it? - That team won't survive.

661
00:25:42,473 --> 00:25:44,703
(This is a game to keep the money to him or herself.)

662
00:25:44,703 --> 00:25:47,233
Look who's talking. When So Min is picked, you are doomed as well.

663
00:25:47,233 --> 00:25:51,973
Be quiet, you unlucky ones.

664
00:25:51,973 --> 00:25:54,703
Stop. That's enough.

665
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:58,203
My team won't get past the first question.

666
00:25:58,203 --> 00:26:00,603
- They are in a pit of fire. - How many questions are there?

667
00:26:00,603 --> 00:26:02,273
You will have to make your decision within 10 seconds...

668
00:26:02,273 --> 00:26:05,103
whether you will keep it or share it. You must decide on...

669
00:26:05,103 --> 00:26:07,003
the amount as well. Say that you earned 30 dollars.

670
00:26:07,003 --> 00:26:10,733
You must distribute the money. You can split it however you want.

671
00:26:10,733 --> 00:26:12,133
If the member's answer is wrong,

672
00:26:12,133 --> 00:26:14,733
the representative member will have to pay 20 dollars as a penalty.

673
00:26:14,733 --> 00:26:16,233
Whoever answered the question?

674
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,633
If you're wrong, you pay 20 dollars.

675
00:26:17,633 --> 00:26:19,333
We have to pay 20 dollars if we don't get the correct answer?

676
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,173
What about the members who don't have enough money?

677
00:26:21,173 --> 00:26:22,433
- Some members have no money. - Right.

678
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:24,073
I have 19 dollars. Cut me some slack.

679
00:26:24,073 --> 00:26:26,333
There is a special loan plan for the ones who have no money.

680
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:27,803
- A loan? - Hold on.

681
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:30,303
You will receive 50 dollars for 1 Tour Sticker.

682
00:26:32,973 --> 00:26:35,273
(If they receive 1 Tour Sticker, they will receive 50 dollars?)

683
00:26:35,273 --> 00:26:37,133
You want me to go on that trip, don't you?

684
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:38,533
- Kwang Soo and I have to go then. - I...

685
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:40,333
- With one more, I have to go. - Come on.

686
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,833
(It's a cruel system for Kwang Soo and Se Chan.)

687
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,133
Gosh, they are good.

688
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:44,633
- I am done with one more Sticker. - Goodness.

689
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:46,833
- This can't be right. - What a horrible producer.

690
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:49,633
- This doesn't make sense. - You gave up since it's over soon.

691
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:52,173
- I will have to sell my body. - For 50 dollars?

692
00:26:52,173 --> 00:26:53,903
I will get 50 dollars for my body?

693
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:56,373
- You can go on that trip. - It's not 500,000 dollars.

694
00:26:56,373 --> 00:26:57,833
Would we risk our lives for 50 dollars?

695
00:26:58,073 --> 00:27:00,433
- If I have one more dollar... - Just go on that trip.

696
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:03,533
Please pick your representatives carefully.

697
00:27:03,533 --> 00:27:05,333
Goodness, they are so cruel.

698
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,173
Can I pay back the loan?

699
00:27:07,173 --> 00:27:08,833
If you can, you can pay it back.

700
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:10,373
- We can do that? - Yes.

701
00:27:10,373 --> 00:27:14,603
If I give you 50 dollars, can you get rid of the Sticker?

702
00:27:14,603 --> 00:27:16,133
- That's not possible. - It's not?

703
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:18,703
Seok Jin, don't try to get out of it. You're bound to go.

704
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,633
No, I heard something is there for me.

705
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:23,073
- The producer told me so. - No, just go on that trip.

706
00:27:23,073 --> 00:27:24,333
He told me that there will be something.

707
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,803
- Seok Jin, compare the prices... - No, I don't need to.

708
00:27:26,803 --> 00:27:28,973
online and look for the cheapest flight.

709
00:27:29,173 --> 00:27:31,533
- He said something good will occur. - Besides,

710
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:33,633
you like researching online.

711
00:27:33,633 --> 00:27:35,373
- I told you that won't happen. - Let's cheer up.

712
00:27:35,373 --> 00:27:37,003
Shouldn't a member with money try the mission?

713
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:38,633
That's right. We don't have money. So Min has some.

714
00:27:38,633 --> 00:27:41,603
- Right. Haha, you should try. - Will Haha try the mission?

715
00:27:41,973 --> 00:27:43,633
I am not good at solving quizzes.

716
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:46,203
I will tell you the first sentence.

717
00:27:46,203 --> 00:27:48,303
The quiz is about sports.

718
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:51,233
- Sports? - Michael Jordan is...

719
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:52,433
- Haha. - Go for it.

720
00:27:52,433 --> 00:27:54,533
(He raises his hand immediately.)

721
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:58,573
He is considered the best basketball player in the history of 120 years.

722
00:27:58,573 --> 00:28:00,133
- Okay. Haha. - Who would like to answer this?

723
00:28:00,133 --> 00:28:01,133
Me.

724
00:28:02,503 --> 00:28:05,433
(Haha is Running Man's official basketball genius.)

725
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:09,333
(In order to solve this quiz, he has been practicing basketball.)

726
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:12,173
- Haha will definitely get this. - He's going to get this right.

727
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:14,473
Haha, here comes the question.

728
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:18,733
He is considered the best basketball player in the history of 120 years.

729
00:28:18,733 --> 00:28:19,773
If so,

730
00:28:20,173 --> 00:28:22,233
- tell me five people whose names... - 1980...

731
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,533
have "Michael" in them.

732
00:28:25,773 --> 00:28:27,733
(Who has Michael in their names?)

733
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:29,703
- Michael Jackson, Michael Bolton, - In 5, 4,

734
00:28:29,703 --> 00:28:31,833
- 3, 2, 1. - Michael Jonathan.

735
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:33,233
(Michael Jonathan?)

736
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:35,733
- Who is Michael Jonathan? - Who is Michael Jonathan?

737
00:28:35,733 --> 00:28:37,973
- Search it online. - Who is Michael Jonathan?

738
00:28:38,073 --> 00:28:39,533
(There might be someone by that name.)

739
00:28:39,533 --> 00:28:41,073
- Go back to your spot. - Haha.

740
00:28:41,073 --> 00:28:42,173
- Hurry. - Hey.

741
00:28:42,173 --> 00:28:43,973
- Pay 20 dollars. - Give him 20 dollars.

742
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:45,733
- Don't be so petty. - Let go of me.

743
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:46,733
- Pay him 20 dollars. - Let me go.

744
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:48,633
There aren't that many celebrities whose name is Michael.

745
00:28:48,633 --> 00:28:52,233
Michael Jonathan is such a nice guy.

746
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:53,903
What does he do for a living?

747
00:28:53,903 --> 00:28:55,803
Is that important?

748
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:58,073
Since you have money, spend some.

749
00:28:58,073 --> 00:29:01,203
All right. Why don't you go and buy yourself something delicious.

750
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,533
You too. You're working hard.

751
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,703
All right. Pay them.

752
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:06,703
Mr. Ha.

753
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,833
(I love you, Mr. Ha, the source of my wealth.)

754
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:11,603
I don't think I should solve the quiz. It's hard.

755
00:29:11,603 --> 00:29:13,333
- We can do this! - We can do this!

756
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:14,973
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

757
00:29:14,973 --> 00:29:16,673
All right, Team Unlucky.

758
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,033
Look at Kwang Soo. His attitude has changed.

759
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:21,533
If I know the question...

760
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:23,203
(I am going to figure this one out.)

761
00:29:23,203 --> 00:29:25,373
- If I know it, I'll do it. - Me too.

762
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:26,533
(I need to make some money.)

763
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:28,933
- It's every man for himself. - I'm going to get it.

764
00:29:31,373 --> 00:29:33,433
In an International A Match,

765
00:29:33,433 --> 00:29:37,903
the referee decides the offense and defense with a coin of FIFA.

766
00:29:38,503 --> 00:29:39,533
Hey!

767
00:29:39,533 --> 00:29:40,533
(He's pushed out.)

768
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:42,803
- Jae Seok. - Hey.

769
00:29:42,803 --> 00:29:44,473
You have to get this right.

770
00:29:44,473 --> 00:29:47,903
- You can do it. - He'll ask FIFA's abbreviation.

771
00:29:47,903 --> 00:29:49,633
(Jae Seok is selected against his will.)

772
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:51,973
It wasn't my intention to move forward.

773
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:53,903
In an International A Match,

774
00:29:53,903 --> 00:29:56,533
the referee decides the offense and defense with a coin of FIFA.

775
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:01,403
If I throw a coin now, will it be heads or tails?

776
00:30:03,173 --> 00:30:05,003
- Will it be heads or tails? - I knew it, Jae Seok!

777
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,203
- Jae Seok. - You never know.

778
00:30:06,203 --> 00:30:07,373
(This is a draw of luck.)

779
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:09,633
- This is a 50-50 chance. - Seriously?

780
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:11,573
I think he might be able to get this one right.

781
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:14,003
- This is 50 to 50. - But Jae Seok won't be able to.

782
00:30:14,003 --> 00:30:15,333
Don't you think so? Jae Seok...

783
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:18,233
- He is really unlucky. - If you choose, that's it.

784
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,833
(Heads or tails?)

785
00:30:20,103 --> 00:30:21,103
Here it goes.

786
00:30:21,103 --> 00:30:22,933
(That is the question.)

787
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:25,473
(If the picture is shown, it's heads.)

788
00:30:25,473 --> 00:30:27,173
(If the number is shown, it's tails.)

789
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:28,173
Heads!

790
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:29,633
- It's heads! - It's heads.

791
00:30:29,633 --> 00:30:31,203
- Hold on. - He'll open it like this.

792
00:30:31,203 --> 00:30:33,703
(What will Jae Seok's decision be?)

793
00:30:33,703 --> 00:30:35,533
- Wait. - It's heads.

794
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:36,633
(It's heads!)

795
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:38,703
It's heads. I saw it, Jae Seok. I saw it.

796
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:41,433
- I saw it, but it's tails. - Will it be heads or tails?

797
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:43,203
(He makes his decision in the midst of their trickery.)

798
00:30:43,203 --> 00:30:44,233
It is...

799
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:45,833
heads!

800
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:50,533
(Jae Seok chooses heads.)

801
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:53,703
(The result is tails.)

802
00:30:53,703 --> 00:30:55,733
What is it? It's tails.

803
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:58,933
(He can't even win a 50-50 chance.)

804
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:00,003
(How can you get that wrong?)

805
00:31:00,003 --> 00:31:01,703
(How could you get that wrong?)

806
00:31:01,803 --> 00:31:03,803
Goodness. I told you so.

807
00:31:03,803 --> 00:31:05,373
- It was so close. - You are the unlucky one.

808
00:31:05,373 --> 00:31:07,533
He's really horrible at judging things.

809
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:08,533
This was so close.

810
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,703
(Jae Seok fails to solve the quiz and pays 20 dollars.)

811
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,133
Here is the question. Se Chan...

812
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:17,233
earned the nickname Strawberry Yang after the last shoot.

813
00:31:17,233 --> 00:31:18,233
Strawberry Yang.

814
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:21,233
- Strawberry Yang? - Se Chan, go. Money's at stake.

815
00:31:21,233 --> 00:31:24,073
If I get a loan, get some money, and pay it back,

816
00:31:24,073 --> 00:31:26,233
- the Sticker will disappear? - Of course.

817
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:28,433
Hold on. If I get it right, I will earn 30 dollars.

818
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:30,033
I just need 20 more dollars.

819
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:32,273
You don't want to share it with others?

820
00:31:32,273 --> 00:31:34,233
I don't have the slightest intention.

821
00:31:34,233 --> 00:31:35,333
(Keeping it is the only way to survive.)

822
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:37,203
I don't care about the people here.

823
00:31:37,203 --> 00:31:38,273
Challenge!

824
00:31:39,103 --> 00:31:43,833
(He has only 5 dollars. He can't afford a fine.)

825
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:46,503
(If he says the wrong answer, he'll be sent on the trip.)

826
00:31:46,503 --> 00:31:51,733
Last week, Se Chan got the nickname Strawberry Yang.

827
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:56,933
How do you spell "strawberry" in English?

828
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:57,933
You have five seconds.

829
00:31:57,933 --> 00:32:00,633
How do you spell "strawberry" in English?

830
00:32:00,633 --> 00:32:02,603
- You have five seconds. - It's an easy one.

831
00:32:02,603 --> 00:32:03,933
He'll get it right.

832
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:05,733
- Hey. - It's "strawberry", right?

833
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:08,303
- Four, three, - S, T...

834
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:11,273
- Straw... S, T, O, R... - two,

835
00:32:11,273 --> 00:32:12,503
one.

836
00:32:12,503 --> 00:32:14,673
- S, T, O, R... - One.

837
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,433
Are you trying to spell "story"?

838
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:19,633
What story are you talking about?

839
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:21,033
Even I know this one.

840
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:22,673
- It's S, T, R. - You really don't know?

841
00:32:22,973 --> 00:32:24,403
Are you serious?

842
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:26,133
Kwang Soo seems to know. He'll try.

843
00:32:26,133 --> 00:32:27,533
- I know it. - What is it?

844
00:32:27,873 --> 00:32:29,303
Try it.

845
00:32:29,673 --> 00:32:30,973
- S, T... - All right.

846
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:36,233
- R... L? R. - Go on.

847
00:32:36,403 --> 00:32:38,403
- A... - Come on.

848
00:32:38,403 --> 00:32:40,773
R, A? Isn't it S, T, R, O?

849
00:32:40,773 --> 00:32:43,033
- It's A. - W.

850
00:32:43,233 --> 00:32:45,473
I'm not the only stupid one.

851
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:47,433
I want you to know. None of us know it.

852
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:48,673
Viewers,

853
00:32:48,673 --> 00:32:51,373
please post the right spelling on our website.

854
00:32:51,373 --> 00:32:53,633
- We'll memorize it. - We'll study hard.

855
00:32:54,503 --> 00:32:55,773
Se Chan is officially going on the trip.

856
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:58,733
Se Chan will go on the Dangerous Trip.

857
00:32:58,733 --> 00:32:59,803
(He has to take a loan and receives one more Sticker.)

858
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:02,533
I can pay back when I earn money, right?

859
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:04,473
Yes, then we'll take away the Sticker.

860
00:33:04,573 --> 00:33:06,233
If he fails to pay back...

861
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:07,973
- He'll be sent on the trip. - I see.

862
00:33:07,973 --> 00:33:08,973
(If he fails to earn 80 dollars, he'll be sent on the trip.)

863
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:10,803
Is it this team's turn now?

864
00:33:10,803 --> 00:33:12,173
Yes. Let's go.

865
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:14,603
"Mamma Mia!" is a musical...

866
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:17,133
loved by many people around the world.

867
00:33:17,173 --> 00:33:19,003
- Jong Kook, try. - I won't.

868
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:21,003
I think the question will be about the songs...

869
00:33:21,003 --> 00:33:22,873
in the musical.

870
00:33:22,873 --> 00:33:24,273
The answer will be "ABBA".

871
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,303
So Min, go. The answer will be "ABBA".

872
00:33:26,303 --> 00:33:27,533
I know only one song by them.

873
00:33:27,533 --> 00:33:28,733
Ji Hyo, go.

874
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:30,733
- I don't have enough money. - I'm sure it's something funny.

875
00:33:30,733 --> 00:33:33,873
You guys can decide who should try.

876
00:33:33,873 --> 00:33:34,933
Let's decide by rock-paper-scissors.

877
00:33:34,933 --> 00:33:37,273
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

878
00:33:37,273 --> 00:33:39,173
(Rock-paper-scissors)

879
00:33:39,173 --> 00:33:40,303
(Ji Hyo and Jong Kook lose.)

880
00:33:40,303 --> 00:33:41,733
Those two haven't tried yet.

881
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:43,903
Rock-paper-scissors.

882
00:33:43,903 --> 00:33:46,003
(Rock-paper-scissors)

883
00:33:46,003 --> 00:33:47,373
(Jong Kook is trying.)

884
00:33:47,373 --> 00:33:49,833
I have a feeling it's something I don't know.

885
00:33:49,933 --> 00:33:52,203
Then be penalized.

886
00:33:52,203 --> 00:33:56,933
"Mamma Mia!" is a musical loved by many people around the world.

887
00:33:56,933 --> 00:34:00,833
What does "Mamma Mia" mean in Italian?

888
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,103
- I know this. - Really?

889
00:34:02,103 --> 00:34:03,903
- I know this. - A: I'm happy.

890
00:34:03,903 --> 00:34:07,003
B: Oh my. C: Excuse me.

891
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,973
- D: I'm delighted. - I know this one.

892
00:34:09,733 --> 00:34:11,403
(I don't know this.)

893
00:34:11,403 --> 00:34:13,733
- It's confusing. - Five, four,

894
00:34:14,003 --> 00:34:15,173
- What was D? - three...

895
00:34:15,173 --> 00:34:17,003
- I can say it right away. - Was it "Excuse me"?

896
00:34:17,003 --> 00:34:19,533
- Two... - B: Oh my.

897
00:34:19,533 --> 00:34:20,573
(He picks.)

898
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:22,333
B: Oh My.

899
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:26,233
(Is it the right answer?)

900
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,443
No way. I got it right?

901
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:29,503
("Oh my" was the right answer.)

902
00:34:30,073 --> 00:34:31,173
- I got it right? - You were right.

903
00:34:31,173 --> 00:34:34,173
Decide how you'll divide up 30 dollars in 10 seconds.

904
00:34:34,173 --> 00:34:35,703
(He has to decide how to divide up 30 dollars.)

905
00:34:35,703 --> 00:34:38,733
You can decide to have everything to yourself and finish the mission.

906
00:34:38,773 --> 00:34:41,903
- You can also divide it up and... - This is it.

907
00:34:42,303 --> 00:34:43,373
This is it.

908
00:34:44,403 --> 00:34:47,373
- Please decide in 10 seconds. - Really?

909
00:34:47,603 --> 00:34:49,473
I'll take everything.

910
00:34:49,473 --> 00:34:51,003
(He doesn't hesitate.)

911
00:34:51,473 --> 00:34:54,233
I'll take everything. I will.

912
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:55,973
Why would I divide it up?

913
00:34:55,973 --> 00:34:57,303
- What are you doing? - What?

914
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,473
Why would I divide it up?

915
00:34:58,473 --> 00:34:59,873
Don't you even have to think?

916
00:34:59,873 --> 00:35:01,473
- We decided by rock-paper-scissors. - The mission is completed.

917
00:35:01,473 --> 00:35:02,873
Why did we play rock-paper-scissors?

918
00:35:02,873 --> 00:35:05,443
(Their mission is completed.)

919
00:35:05,443 --> 00:35:08,333
With Jong Kook taking 30 dollars, you guys are done with the mission.

920
00:35:08,803 --> 00:35:11,603
- It's over. Go now. - Go home.

921
00:35:11,803 --> 00:35:13,833
- You're so mean. - What?

922
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:16,133
Divide it up and do some more quizzes.

923
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:17,803
Why would I do that?

924
00:35:17,803 --> 00:35:19,033
- Jong Kook. - I should have done it.

925
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,503
- What's the point? - How can you do this?

926
00:35:21,503 --> 00:35:23,973
Why did you make me do it? I didn't want to.

927
00:35:23,973 --> 00:35:25,133
He has a point.

928
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:26,973
- You lost rock-paper-scissors. - Right? It wasn't my choice.

929
00:35:26,973 --> 00:35:29,173
- What are you, Bao Zheng? - Yes.

930
00:35:29,173 --> 00:35:33,943
I accepted the challenge despite my mental stress.

931
00:35:35,173 --> 00:35:37,373
Think of the mental stress you gave to your team members.

932
00:35:37,943 --> 00:35:39,673
Can you not think about that?

933
00:35:39,673 --> 00:35:40,733
(He's giving mental stress to his team members.)

934
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:42,573
Let's start.

935
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:43,633
Here we go.

936
00:35:44,033 --> 00:35:47,903
April 28 is General Yi Sun Sin's birthday.

937
00:35:48,133 --> 00:35:50,003
- I know. - I can't do this anymore.

938
00:35:50,003 --> 00:35:51,533
I can't do this anymore.

939
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:52,533
(Pushing)

940
00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:53,533
Now...

941
00:35:53,533 --> 00:35:55,943
(Kwang Soo will try this time.)

942
00:35:56,873 --> 00:35:59,103
(I think someone pushed him.)

943
00:35:59,403 --> 00:36:02,173
Kwang Soo, you're here.

944
00:36:02,173 --> 00:36:03,273
That was nice.

945
00:36:03,273 --> 00:36:05,303
You'll have to take a loan.

946
00:36:05,373 --> 00:36:07,803
Wait. This is unfair.

947
00:36:07,873 --> 00:36:10,403
I have 19 dollars. Please lend me one dollar.

948
00:36:10,403 --> 00:36:12,133
Cheol Min, please.

949
00:36:12,133 --> 00:36:13,443
I'm not talking to my producer.

950
00:36:13,443 --> 00:36:16,703
Cheol Min, we're friends. Can't you lend me a dollar?

951
00:36:17,233 --> 00:36:20,073
(I'll make sure to pay you back.)

952
00:36:20,073 --> 00:36:22,033
I have 19 dollars.

953
00:36:22,033 --> 00:36:23,633
You might get the question right.

954
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:25,803
- You might. - I can't.

955
00:36:25,803 --> 00:36:27,173
(You know I can't.)

956
00:36:27,173 --> 00:36:28,773
You know I can't.

957
00:36:30,673 --> 00:36:32,333
(Kwang Soo will be one step closer to the Dangerous Trip.)

958
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:35,173
April 28 is General Yi Sun Sin's birthday.

959
00:36:36,033 --> 00:36:40,473
I'll toss this coin General Yi Sun Sin is depicted in.

960
00:36:40,473 --> 00:36:43,403
Will it be heads or tails?

961
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:45,333
You can do this.

962
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:47,303
You have a 50-percent chance.

963
00:36:47,403 --> 00:36:48,903
You wanted to do this.

964
00:36:48,903 --> 00:36:50,273
- Okay. - Go for tails.

965
00:36:50,273 --> 00:36:52,303
You usually get the same one repeatedly.

966
00:36:52,943 --> 00:36:54,073
(The coin is tossed.)

967
00:36:54,073 --> 00:36:56,603
Kwang Soo, it's heads.

968
00:36:56,803 --> 00:36:58,943
- It's heads. - The number side is tails, right?

969
00:36:59,073 --> 00:37:01,173
- It's heads. - It's heads.

970
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:03,603
- It's heads. - It's heads.

971
00:37:03,773 --> 00:37:05,273
- It's heads. - It's heads.

972
00:37:05,273 --> 00:37:07,203
- It's heads. - It's heads.

973
00:37:07,203 --> 00:37:08,603
(All his team members say it's heads.)

974
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:10,943
If you borrow 50 dollars, you get one Sticker.

975
00:37:10,943 --> 00:37:13,603
(If he gets it wrong, he'll be sent on the trip.)

976
00:37:13,603 --> 00:37:14,873
(What will Kwang Soo say?)

977
00:37:14,873 --> 00:37:15,903
Heads.

978
00:37:15,903 --> 00:37:17,173
(He listens to his team.)

979
00:37:17,173 --> 00:37:18,203
Heads.

980
00:37:19,943 --> 00:37:21,003
Heads.

981
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:22,273
It was tails.

982
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,833
(Tails)

983
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:24,873
You guys...

984
00:37:24,873 --> 00:37:26,733
(You guys...)

985
00:37:26,733 --> 00:37:28,633
(I won't forgive you.)

986
00:37:28,633 --> 00:37:29,943
He's taking a loan.

987
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:33,773
(Together, they become super unlucky.)

988
00:37:33,773 --> 00:37:35,373
My goodness.

989
00:37:36,503 --> 00:37:39,133
He's taking a loan.

990
00:37:39,573 --> 00:37:40,903
It's because of that brat.

991
00:37:41,673 --> 00:37:43,773
Kwang Soo is going on the trip, right?

992
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:46,303
Hey. Kwang Soo.

993
00:37:46,303 --> 00:37:48,943
(He shouldn't have trusted his team.)

994
00:37:49,803 --> 00:37:50,903
By the way,

995
00:37:50,903 --> 00:37:53,833
we really are unlucky.

996
00:37:54,173 --> 00:37:56,133
Calm down.

997
00:37:56,133 --> 00:37:58,033
We're so unlucky.

998
00:37:58,733 --> 00:38:00,803
I just need one dollar.

999
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:02,303
One dollar.

1000
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:05,473
I'll do anything for you. Please give me one dollar.

1001
00:38:05,473 --> 00:38:06,673
Please give me one dollar.

1002
00:38:07,373 --> 00:38:09,133
- 1 dollar. - I'll give you 20 dollars less.

1003
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:10,503
I'll pay you back 10 dollars.

1004
00:38:10,633 --> 00:38:11,943
Kwang Soo is going on the trip.

1005
00:38:11,943 --> 00:38:16,333
(Kwang Soo will be sent on the trip.)

1006
00:38:17,073 --> 00:38:18,603
This time, it'll be Jae Seok.

1007
00:38:18,873 --> 00:38:20,303
I'm sure.

1008
00:38:20,303 --> 00:38:22,273
It'll be Jae Seok this time. Be careful.

1009
00:38:22,273 --> 00:38:24,303
- Three on our team... - Three of us...

1010
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,533
are going on the Dangerous Trip.

1011
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:27,833
(Three on his team are being sent on the trip.)

1012
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:29,943
We could just...

1013
00:38:29,943 --> 00:38:32,103
send the whole team.

1014
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:33,703
I can't believe this.

1015
00:38:33,703 --> 00:38:36,873
Actor Kim Myung Min won the Grand Prize...

1016
00:38:36,873 --> 00:38:39,373
for his role in "Beethoven Virus".

1017
00:38:39,373 --> 00:38:40,943
"You piece of garbage."

1018
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,973
"You piece of garbage."

1019
00:38:42,973 --> 00:38:44,033
(It's his famous line from the drama.)

1020
00:38:44,203 --> 00:38:45,373
Why me?

1021
00:38:45,973 --> 00:38:46,973
Why?

1022
00:38:47,203 --> 00:38:49,833
Why me? Why?

1023
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:51,473
Go ahead.

1024
00:38:51,473 --> 00:38:52,903
He'll have to take a loan too.

1025
00:38:53,303 --> 00:38:54,973
My goodness.

1026
00:38:54,973 --> 00:38:58,833
Actor Kim Myung Min appeared in "Beethoven Virus".

1027
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:02,303
What is Beethoven's full name?

1028
00:39:02,703 --> 00:39:06,873
A: Franz Beethoven. B: Ludwig van Beethoven.

1029
00:39:06,873 --> 00:39:08,733
Wolfgang Amadeus Beethoven.

1030
00:39:08,733 --> 00:39:12,073
C: Wolfgang Amadeus Beethoven.

1031
00:39:12,703 --> 00:39:15,403
D: Johann Sebastian Beethoven.

1032
00:39:15,403 --> 00:39:16,973
- He's amazing. - C?

1033
00:39:16,973 --> 00:39:18,633
- He already said his answer. - Don't try to make it funny.

1034
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:20,873
It's Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,

1035
00:39:20,873 --> 00:39:22,173
now that I think of it.

1036
00:39:22,603 --> 00:39:24,873
(You're amazing.)

1037
00:39:25,173 --> 00:39:26,533
You're incredible.

1038
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:27,973
Seok Jin, choose D.

1039
00:39:27,973 --> 00:39:29,703
- It's definitely Johann. - Choose D.

1040
00:39:30,303 --> 00:39:32,533
Michael Jonathan Batman.

1041
00:39:32,673 --> 00:39:33,673
Batman?

1042
00:39:33,673 --> 00:39:34,673
(They're trying to confuse him.)

1043
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:35,943
Michael Jonathan Batman.

1044
00:39:35,943 --> 00:39:37,633
- What? - Batman?

1045
00:39:37,703 --> 00:39:38,803
- Batman? - Do you choose B?

1046
00:39:38,803 --> 00:39:39,803
Yes, B.

1047
00:39:39,873 --> 00:39:40,903
(Seok Jin chooses B.)

1048
00:39:40,903 --> 00:39:42,173
- Do you choose B? - Yes, B.

1049
00:39:43,443 --> 00:39:44,633
(Is Seok Jin right?)

1050
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:46,273
B: Ludwig van Beethoven.

1051
00:39:46,273 --> 00:39:47,373
(B: Ludwig van Beethoven)

1052
00:39:47,373 --> 00:39:49,973
(Correct)

1053
00:39:49,973 --> 00:39:52,373
You have 10 seconds.

1054
00:39:52,373 --> 00:39:54,903
- Divide it up. - Divide it up.

1055
00:39:54,903 --> 00:39:56,533
- You should divide it up. - Divide it up.

1056
00:39:56,533 --> 00:39:57,943
- Hey. - Divide it up.

1057
00:39:57,943 --> 00:39:59,533
(Give it all to me.)

1058
00:39:59,533 --> 00:40:00,573
(Seok Jin chooses to have 30 dollars to himself.)

1059
00:40:00,573 --> 00:40:02,443
You and I saw dolphins together.

1060
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:03,503
Seok Jin.

1061
00:40:03,603 --> 00:40:05,873
Think of why I've ended up this way.

1062
00:40:05,973 --> 00:40:07,473
Who ruined my life?

1063
00:40:07,473 --> 00:40:09,473
I'll have everything to myself.

1064
00:40:10,203 --> 00:40:11,773
- You can't trust anybody. - Okay.

1065
00:40:12,103 --> 00:40:13,833
We just finished the first round,

1066
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:16,803
and already three people have received three Tour Stickers.

1067
00:40:16,803 --> 00:40:19,103
Can't we wrap up now?

1068
00:40:19,103 --> 00:40:20,503
Anyway,

1069
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:22,443
- if you pay your debt, - You can lose your sticker?

1070
00:40:22,443 --> 00:40:24,033
- a Sticker will be taken away. - All right.

1071
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:25,373
I have a debt of 80 dollars.

1072
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:28,233
I'm faced with danger because of one dollar.

1073
00:40:28,703 --> 00:40:29,773
Because of one dollar.

1074
00:40:29,773 --> 00:40:32,003
Why did you choose heads?

1075
00:40:32,373 --> 00:40:34,333
(You little...)

1076
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:35,703
(Laughing)

1077
00:40:35,703 --> 00:40:38,733
We'll move to a place where Round Two will take place.

1078
00:40:38,733 --> 00:40:40,133
- Okay. - Let's go.

1079
00:40:40,973 --> 00:40:43,703
(Global Race)

1080
00:40:43,703 --> 00:40:45,133
- Dolphins. - That's so cool.

1081
00:40:45,573 --> 00:40:47,273
We saw them in person.

1082
00:40:47,273 --> 00:40:48,733
- We saw them. - We did.

1083
00:40:48,733 --> 00:40:49,903
We saw 500 of them.

1084
00:40:49,903 --> 00:40:51,133
(This place shows the history of Ulsan.)

1085
00:40:51,133 --> 00:40:53,003
Will the teams be the same?

1086
00:40:53,133 --> 00:40:54,803
It's a team competition again.

1087
00:40:54,803 --> 00:40:57,733
You can form new teams.

1088
00:40:57,733 --> 00:40:59,973
(They can form new teams.)

1089
00:41:00,573 --> 00:41:02,633
(New teams?)

1090
00:41:02,633 --> 00:41:03,903
- All right. - We'll form new teams?

1091
00:41:03,903 --> 00:41:05,273
I guess it doesn't matter.

1092
00:41:05,273 --> 00:41:06,833
Those who took the prize money to themselves...

1093
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:09,333
should team up.

1094
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,073
Fine, come here.

1095
00:41:11,073 --> 00:41:12,773
- It doesn't matter. - It'll change again.

1096
00:41:12,773 --> 00:41:14,733
- I'll stay here. - This is a liberal democracy.

1097
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:16,443
- They're cool. - I earned my prize.

1098
00:41:16,443 --> 00:41:17,803
So Min, can you help us this time?

1099
00:41:17,803 --> 00:41:18,873
- Please. - Okay.

1100
00:41:18,873 --> 00:41:20,633
We need your help.

1101
00:41:20,803 --> 00:41:22,133
If you're cool, come here.

1102
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:23,173
- Hey, come here. - If you're cool.

1103
00:41:23,173 --> 00:41:25,773
You said you wanted to team up with me.

1104
00:41:25,773 --> 00:41:26,903
- If you're cool, come here. - We're done.

1105
00:41:26,903 --> 00:41:28,473
- It's perfect. - Come here.

1106
00:41:28,473 --> 00:41:30,403
- Okay. - I like it.

1107
00:41:30,473 --> 00:41:32,373
We're cool people.

1108
00:41:32,373 --> 00:41:34,033
(The teams have been formed.)

1109
00:41:34,133 --> 00:41:36,233
The next mission is called...

1110
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:39,533
It's called Your Dangerous Choices.

1111
00:41:39,533 --> 00:41:42,903
(Round 3 of Dangerous Choices is called Your Dangerous Choices.)

1112
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,673
- Your choices? - Yes, your choices.

1113
00:41:44,673 --> 00:41:45,943
Your choices.

1114
00:41:46,633 --> 00:41:49,733
First, discuss with your team members how much you will bet...

1115
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:53,873
on a total of four missions with different levels.

1116
00:41:54,733 --> 00:41:57,373
You will have 4 missions and 4 choices of betting money.

1117
00:41:57,373 --> 00:42:00,103
The other team will randomly choose your mission and betting money.

1118
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:03,103
- This is difficult. - It's hard.

1119
00:42:05,003 --> 00:42:08,603
Your team's mission is Shouting Speed Quiz.

1120
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:13,473
You have to guess the answer right within the time limit, 100 seconds.

1121
00:42:13,473 --> 00:42:15,773
The distance between the examiner and the rest of you...

1122
00:42:15,773 --> 00:42:18,233
will be among 1cm, 5m, 50m, or 100m.

1123
00:42:18,273 --> 00:42:19,303
(Shouting Speed Quiz)

1124
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:23,033
(It is best for them that they choose 1cm.)

1125
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:25,703
Your mission is called...

1126
00:42:26,103 --> 00:42:28,333
Spin and Kick.

1127
00:42:28,603 --> 00:42:30,833
- "Spin and Kick"? - Yes.

1128
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:32,573
- That sounds like dolphins. - I see.

1129
00:42:32,573 --> 00:42:34,303
Spin 10 times in place first...

1130
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:38,173
and throw your shoe to hit the doll.

1131
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:42,803
The number of members that need to succeed is among 1, 2, 3, or 4.

1132
00:42:43,403 --> 00:42:45,033
(It's best for them to choose 1.)

1133
00:42:45,033 --> 00:42:46,703
So they will choose how many members we need to succeed, right?

1134
00:42:47,203 --> 00:42:49,803
- We can pull some tricks here? - Yes, you're right.

1135
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:51,903
- This is worth five dollars. - Right.

1136
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,443
- Let's make this four people. - Good.

1137
00:42:54,443 --> 00:42:55,903
(They arrange the numbers so the other team picks the easiest one.)

1138
00:42:55,903 --> 00:42:57,573
It's predictable though.

1139
00:42:57,573 --> 00:42:59,373
- We can't help it. - Okay.

1140
00:42:59,373 --> 00:43:00,803
- How about we make this into one? - You can also...

1141
00:43:00,803 --> 00:43:02,443
Hey, So Min.

1142
00:43:02,943 --> 00:43:06,073
(The spy appears.)

1143
00:43:06,073 --> 00:43:07,233
- So Min, you... - So Min.

1144
00:43:07,233 --> 00:43:08,873
- Seriously. - You learned only the bad stuff.

1145
00:43:08,873 --> 00:43:10,103
(Spy So Min fails to get a clue.)

1146
00:43:10,103 --> 00:43:11,203
What did you say?

1147
00:43:11,303 --> 00:43:12,873
They're so aggressive.

1148
00:43:13,803 --> 00:43:15,333
(Careful)

1149
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:17,333
They will know by looking at how our hands move.

1150
00:43:17,533 --> 00:43:19,533
Where are you going?

1151
00:43:20,173 --> 00:43:22,603
- Where are you going? - Gosh.

1152
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,603
- Where are you heading? - It won't give you a clue.

1153
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:29,233
(The original spy fails as well.)

1154
00:43:29,703 --> 00:43:31,533
(They've finished preparing for Your Dangerous Choices.)

1155
00:43:32,203 --> 00:43:33,803
- We're done. - They did it that way.

1156
00:43:33,803 --> 00:43:36,873
Which team should we start with?

1157
00:43:37,203 --> 00:43:39,133
- Let's do rock-paper-scissors. - Let's do that.

1158
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:41,533
- Let's do something else. - What then?

1159
00:43:41,533 --> 00:43:42,903
- Upgraded rock-paper-scissors. - Get hit on the back of your hand,

1160
00:43:42,903 --> 00:43:44,933
and if you don't make a noise, you win.

1161
00:43:44,973 --> 00:43:47,003
I'll go first against Seok Jin.

1162
00:43:47,033 --> 00:43:48,603
I'll do this with Seok Jin.

1163
00:43:48,603 --> 00:43:49,703
Why should I go first?

1164
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:52,303
If you hold it in, you get to hit me next.

1165
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:56,333
You just made a noise.

1166
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,633
(Groaning)

1167
00:43:57,833 --> 00:43:59,603
(Oh, no. You made a noise.)

1168
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:00,673
I'm sorry, but you're out.

1169
00:44:02,103 --> 00:44:03,633
It was like that of dolphins.

1170
00:44:03,633 --> 00:44:05,003
I think I heard it this morning.

1171
00:44:05,603 --> 00:44:08,833
- Did you follow me here? - Oh, gosh.

1172
00:44:08,903 --> 00:44:10,933
- Yes, I did. - I forgot about you for a second.

1173
00:44:10,933 --> 00:44:12,073
(Sigh)

1174
00:44:12,433 --> 00:44:16,373
(Team Jae Seok gets to choose the other team's mission first.)

1175
00:44:16,373 --> 00:44:17,633
Choose, and we'll reveal what it is.

1176
00:44:17,633 --> 00:44:20,103
- I go for 3. - Let's choose 3 then.

1177
00:44:20,273 --> 00:44:22,573
(Their expressions are mysterious.)

1178
00:44:22,573 --> 00:44:24,203
And for the amount, we choose two.

1179
00:44:24,403 --> 00:44:25,903
We choose 3 for the difficulty level and 2 for the amount.

1180
00:44:26,573 --> 00:44:27,903
- Gosh. - Show us the amount first.

1181
00:44:28,073 --> 00:44:29,333
- Good. - Show us.

1182
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:37,103
(It's best for them if the betting money turns out to be 50 dollars.)

1183
00:44:37,203 --> 00:44:39,103
(But if their difficulty level turns out to be 4 people,)

1184
00:44:39,103 --> 00:44:41,303
(their possibility to lose money will go up.)

1185
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:44,073
- That was perfect. - It's 50 dollars.

1186
00:44:44,073 --> 00:44:45,333
(Their betting money is 50 dollars.)

1187
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:47,003
(They have a nice start.)

1188
00:44:47,003 --> 00:44:49,373
- Okay. - 50 dollars is nice.

1189
00:44:49,573 --> 00:44:52,003
- What number was for the level? - It was three.

1190
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:53,673
- Okay. - One...

1191
00:44:53,673 --> 00:44:56,103
(Having fewer number of people to succeed will be advantageous.)

1192
00:44:56,103 --> 00:44:57,403
- 2, 3. - My goodness.

1193
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,503
It's 4 people.

1194
00:44:58,503 --> 00:45:01,773
(They get the hardest level.)

1195
00:45:02,203 --> 00:45:04,003
- So 4 people must succeed? - 4 people?

1196
00:45:04,203 --> 00:45:05,703
So why did you listen to Kwang Soo?

1197
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:06,733
Wait.

1198
00:45:06,733 --> 00:45:08,273
(Wait)

1199
00:45:08,673 --> 00:45:10,203
So why did you tell us to choose number three?

1200
00:45:10,203 --> 00:45:11,373
- Right. - Wait.

1201
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:15,933
- This mission is for their team. - What?

1202
00:45:15,933 --> 00:45:17,203
- What? - My gosh.

1203
00:45:17,203 --> 00:45:18,503
(That's why it's called Your Dangerous Choices.)

1204
00:45:18,903 --> 00:45:22,203
So Team Jong Kook's betting money is 50 dollars with the hardest level.

1205
00:45:22,203 --> 00:45:23,603
What we did is good, right?

1206
00:45:23,603 --> 00:45:24,733
- Right. - I did well too.

1207
00:45:24,733 --> 00:45:26,703
I mean, they blame me for anything first.

1208
00:45:27,903 --> 00:45:29,273
So they choose the mission for us.

1209
00:45:29,273 --> 00:45:30,503
- It's ours? - It's ours.

1210
00:45:30,503 --> 00:45:31,503
Goodness.

1211
00:45:31,503 --> 00:45:33,503
- So I did well. - Good job.

1212
00:45:33,503 --> 00:45:35,133
- Good job. - Compliment me then.

1213
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:38,273
- We're busy filming so how can we? - I mean...

1214
00:45:38,533 --> 00:45:40,103
- We're busy. Can't you see? - So...

1215
00:45:40,103 --> 00:45:42,433
They need to hurry home after work too.

1216
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:45,033
We don't have time to compliment you.

1217
00:45:45,433 --> 00:45:47,873
Just make a new segment for yourself and do it there.

1218
00:45:48,273 --> 00:45:50,333
- I'm working on it. - Okay.

1219
00:45:51,173 --> 00:45:53,133
All right. It's for Team Jae Seok now.

1220
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:54,973
- Let's do number 4. - 4?

1221
00:45:55,433 --> 00:45:56,633
- Four is a good number. - Okay.

1222
00:45:56,633 --> 00:45:58,073
- Let's go with 4 and 4. - Okay.

1223
00:45:58,073 --> 00:45:59,133
- 4 and 4. - 4 and 4.

1224
00:45:59,503 --> 00:46:00,633
The amount is...

1225
00:46:00,803 --> 00:46:06,303
(It's best for Team Jae Seok to have 1cm and 50 dollars.)

1226
00:46:06,303 --> 00:46:12,403
(It's the worst for them if they get 100m and 50 dollars.)

1227
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:14,503
- 50 dollars! - 50 dollars.

1228
00:46:14,503 --> 00:46:19,073
(It's the hardest level for them as well.)

1229
00:46:19,073 --> 00:46:21,203
- It's 100m. - Our choice was perfect.

1230
00:46:21,203 --> 00:46:24,203
- I knew this would happen. - We have nothing to lose then.

1231
00:46:24,203 --> 00:46:26,673
I told you to mix the numbers up.

1232
00:46:27,433 --> 00:46:29,203
(It's the worst for both teams. How will the mission turn out to be?)

1233
00:46:31,273 --> 00:46:32,303
(Your Dangerous Choices)

1234
00:46:32,303 --> 00:46:33,973
- Let's head down now. - Okay.

1235
00:46:34,203 --> 00:46:36,203
(Spin and Kick, Shouting Speed Quiz)

1236
00:46:37,673 --> 00:46:40,033
They decorated things like a traditional village.

1237
00:46:40,103 --> 00:46:41,273
It's like an experience center.

1238
00:46:41,273 --> 00:46:42,633
(Ulsan natives used to live with dolphins.)

1239
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,173
It's so well-built.

1240
00:46:44,173 --> 00:46:47,633
Ulsan has been the city of rich people since long time ago.

1241
00:46:47,673 --> 00:46:49,473
(The past is brought back in Jangsaengpo Village.)

1242
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,333
It says the village was so wealthy...

1243
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:53,933
that even dogs were carrying 10-dollar bills.

1244
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:57,273
(That is why we cast puppies with 10-dollar bills for today's guests.)

1245
00:46:58,133 --> 00:47:00,703
Team Jong Kook will start with the mission first.

1246
00:47:00,703 --> 00:47:01,803
- Okay. - Okay.

1247
00:47:01,803 --> 00:47:05,803
Spin 5 times and throw your shoe targeting 1 of these dolls.

1248
00:47:05,803 --> 00:47:07,973
(It's a success if they spin 5 times and hit the doll with their shoe.)

1249
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:10,633
Since all of you need to succeed,

1250
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:12,073
if anyone of you fails the mission...

1251
00:47:12,073 --> 00:47:13,703
- It won't be that difficult. - Right.

1252
00:47:13,703 --> 00:47:14,803
(If they fail, they lose 50 dollars.)

1253
00:47:14,803 --> 00:47:16,973
The thing is, I didn't get enough sleep.

1254
00:47:16,973 --> 00:47:18,233
Stop it already.

1255
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,573
Stop making a fuss and focus.

1256
00:47:20,573 --> 00:47:23,303
- Be positive. We can do this. - Okay.

1257
00:47:23,303 --> 00:47:26,133
Se Chan, how do you feel about being in this team?

1258
00:47:26,233 --> 00:47:27,733
It's depressing.

1259
00:47:27,733 --> 00:47:30,633
Whenever we try to get things done, one person stops us all.

1260
00:47:30,633 --> 00:47:31,673
- So stop complaining. - I'm not that bad.

1261
00:47:31,673 --> 00:47:33,833
- He always brings us down. - It's okay.

1262
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:35,803
(It's a rough start for them. Will they be all right?)

1263
00:47:36,403 --> 00:47:37,573
Let's do this.

1264
00:47:38,103 --> 00:47:39,973
You'll try out one by one.

1265
00:47:40,303 --> 00:47:42,633
- If you fail, the mission ends. - Right away?

1266
00:47:43,203 --> 00:47:45,273
- Can we do some practice? - I'll go last.

1267
00:47:45,373 --> 00:47:46,573
Let us practice once.

1268
00:47:46,573 --> 00:47:48,373
No way.

1269
00:47:48,373 --> 00:47:51,273
We need to get the grip on how our shoes fly.

1270
00:47:51,273 --> 00:47:53,833
- What grip? - Don't you think so?

1271
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:54,973
Just do it.

1272
00:47:55,703 --> 00:47:58,433
(He looks at the ground while shouting.)

1273
00:47:58,433 --> 00:48:00,603
(He shouts in a very polite way.)

1274
00:48:00,603 --> 00:48:02,403
- Whom were you talking to? - What was that?

1275
00:48:02,403 --> 00:48:03,933
- Where were you looking? - I'm right here.

1276
00:48:03,933 --> 00:48:04,973
- What? - Whom did you talk to?

1277
00:48:04,973 --> 00:48:07,003
- Why would you look at the ground? - Be confident.

1278
00:48:07,273 --> 00:48:08,903
- He's such a coward. - Why would he...

1279
00:48:08,903 --> 00:48:10,473
I just told them to start.

1280
00:48:10,503 --> 00:48:12,103
- Let us practice. - What?

1281
00:48:12,603 --> 00:48:13,603
As a practice?

1282
00:48:13,703 --> 00:48:15,173
- Will you start? - Yes.

1283
00:48:15,173 --> 00:48:16,303
Ready.

1284
00:48:16,873 --> 00:48:18,103
We don't have a time limit.

1285
00:48:18,273 --> 00:48:21,473
(Spinning fast)

1286
00:48:21,633 --> 00:48:24,273
(Their mission will be put to an end as soon as one of them fails.)

1287
00:48:24,273 --> 00:48:25,803
- Five. - Now throw.

1288
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,573
(Dizzy)

1289
00:48:27,573 --> 00:48:28,933
Hurry and throw.

1290
00:48:29,633 --> 00:48:31,373
- There isn't a time limit. - You can't let them do that.

1291
00:48:31,373 --> 00:48:32,573
I'll go.

1292
00:48:32,573 --> 00:48:33,973
(He dragged time unusually. How will the result be?)

1293
00:48:33,973 --> 00:48:35,233
- Okay. - That's it.

1294
00:48:36,933 --> 00:48:38,473
- That's it. - That's our Jong Kook.

1295
00:48:38,473 --> 00:48:40,873
(Jong Kook succeeds.)

1296
00:48:40,873 --> 00:48:41,933
- He hit it right. - That's it.

1297
00:48:41,933 --> 00:48:43,503
This is harder than you think.

1298
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,103
- This is hard. - Okay.

1299
00:48:45,273 --> 00:48:47,033
- Haha. - Okay, one of you succeeded.

1300
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:50,273
Why don't you just let them go home, come back, and throw?

1301
00:48:50,433 --> 00:48:52,173
- This isn't fair. - You can't do that.

1302
00:48:52,373 --> 00:48:54,933
- It doesn't make sense. - Count to 10 then.

1303
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:57,303
Counting to 10 is still too much.

1304
00:48:57,633 --> 00:49:00,003
(He's looking at the ground again.)

1305
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,203
Do it yourself then.

1306
00:49:02,033 --> 00:49:03,733
Where exactly are you looking?

1307
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:05,103
- What was that again? - That's funny.

1308
00:49:05,103 --> 00:49:07,073
How I did was reasonable.

1309
00:49:07,173 --> 00:49:09,833
I'll give you 3 seconds after your 5 spins.

1310
00:49:10,173 --> 00:49:11,433
I'll go.

1311
00:49:11,633 --> 00:49:13,603
(Haha starts.)

1312
00:49:13,603 --> 00:49:16,173
- Don't spin too fast. - Three.

1313
00:49:16,603 --> 00:49:18,303
- Four. - Spin here.

1314
00:49:18,303 --> 00:49:19,473
- 5. That's it. - 5.

1315
00:49:19,473 --> 00:49:21,273
(He finishes with his spins.)

1316
00:49:21,273 --> 00:49:22,433
- Slowly. - Three.

1317
00:49:22,433 --> 00:49:25,073
(Their mission ends if he fails.)

1318
00:49:25,073 --> 00:49:31,433
(Will they lose money or double the amount?)

1319
00:49:31,433 --> 00:49:33,173
- Seriously. - Okay!

1320
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:35,803
(That was a clear miss.)

1321
00:49:35,933 --> 00:49:38,033
Okay! They fail the mission.

1322
00:49:38,033 --> 00:49:39,973
(Pay 50 dollars. The deal is closed.)

1323
00:49:41,003 --> 00:49:42,533
(Did I fail? I'm still dizzy.)

1324
00:49:42,633 --> 00:49:44,673
- You try it. - Three counts won't do it.

1325
00:49:44,673 --> 00:49:47,473
- That's too soon. - Give us five seconds.

1326
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:49,873
(They agreed on giving the team 5 seconds after the spins.)

1327
00:49:50,003 --> 00:49:52,403
- Otherwise, you can never do it. - Give them five seconds.

1328
00:49:52,873 --> 00:49:55,303
- I can do this. - This is too hard.

1329
00:49:55,433 --> 00:49:56,933
And you punk!

1330
00:49:56,933 --> 00:49:58,803
(The tiger is angry.)

1331
00:49:58,803 --> 00:49:59,873
Focus.

1332
00:49:59,873 --> 00:50:01,473
Seniority is dead in our team.

1333
00:50:01,533 --> 00:50:02,933
Use your foot more wisely. Look.

1334
00:50:03,173 --> 00:50:05,233
Do you not have the right to speak?

1335
00:50:05,233 --> 00:50:07,233
- Why... - We follow the American style here.

1336
00:50:07,603 --> 00:50:08,833
We're all friends.

1337
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:12,133
You do it all by yourself, so how is that American style?

1338
00:50:12,133 --> 00:50:14,233
- We're in the Western age. - Sure.

1339
00:50:14,233 --> 00:50:16,303
You get shot if you don't follow.

1340
00:50:17,173 --> 00:50:18,673
- I'll go. - Okay.

1341
00:50:18,673 --> 00:50:20,003
(Haha goes off again.)

1342
00:50:20,003 --> 00:50:21,933
Ready, set, and go.

1343
00:50:22,203 --> 00:50:25,573
(He spins slowly this time.)

1344
00:50:25,573 --> 00:50:27,233
Gosh, seriously.

1345
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:28,573
We won't give you another chance if you're being like this.

1346
00:50:28,573 --> 00:50:29,933
Or he'll teach me a lesson.

1347
00:50:30,533 --> 00:50:32,073
If I spin fast, he'll scold me.

1348
00:50:32,133 --> 00:50:33,133
(Do you have any idea?)

1349
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:34,973
- So what should I do? - It's all right.

1350
00:50:34,973 --> 00:50:36,573
It's all right.

1351
00:50:36,573 --> 00:50:37,933
Mamma mia!

1352
00:50:37,933 --> 00:50:40,633
- Haha, take it easy. - All right.

1353
00:50:40,633 --> 00:50:42,833
- That's enough. - It's better to be scolded by you.

1354
00:50:43,103 --> 00:50:46,203
(They're so happy not to be in that team.)

1355
00:50:46,573 --> 00:50:49,173
Just spin at an ambiguous speed. You know what I'm saying.

1356
00:50:49,433 --> 00:50:50,733
Okay? Now, spin.

1357
00:50:51,033 --> 00:50:52,603
(This time, he does it seriously.)

1358
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:55,703
- That's it. - 1, 2, 3...

1359
00:50:55,703 --> 00:50:58,103
A little bit faster!

1360
00:50:58,103 --> 00:51:00,503
(His whipping continues.)

1361
00:51:00,973 --> 00:51:03,873
(It seems uneasy this time as well.)

1362
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,473
- It'd be hard even without spins. - Five seconds now.

1363
00:51:06,503 --> 00:51:08,273
- Do it. - 2, 3.

1364
00:51:08,303 --> 00:51:09,333
Throw!

1365
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:11,033
(He throws.)

1366
00:51:13,373 --> 00:51:15,103
(Sorry, Haha.)

1367
00:51:15,103 --> 00:51:16,373
Oh, come on.

1368
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:18,233
- Let's stop. - Hey.

1369
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,903
(In despair)

1370
00:51:21,303 --> 00:51:23,103
(That little punk can't do it.)

1371
00:51:23,233 --> 00:51:25,933
- Let Seok Jin try it. - This isn't right.

1372
00:51:26,103 --> 00:51:28,373
(I clearly told you to spin at an ambiguous speed.)

1373
00:51:28,733 --> 00:51:32,073
Can I have a break for two weeks?

1374
00:51:32,333 --> 00:51:34,773
I can't go on like this.

1375
00:51:35,903 --> 00:51:37,633
Look at him.

1376
00:51:38,033 --> 00:51:40,273
(He's about to explode.)

1377
00:51:40,273 --> 00:51:42,173
I'm begging you.

1378
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:44,533
Please.

1379
00:51:44,533 --> 00:51:45,533
(Haha gets another chance.)

1380
00:51:45,533 --> 00:51:47,733
My target is the stuffed dog in the middle.

1381
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:49,033
Hit any one of them.

1382
00:51:49,033 --> 00:51:50,873
- Get ready. - Don't make a mistake.

1383
00:51:50,873 --> 00:51:52,333
(What is he doing?)

1384
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:54,133
(He makes a creative pose.)

1385
00:51:54,433 --> 00:51:56,433
What kind of pose is that?

1386
00:51:57,273 --> 00:51:59,233
- It's up to me. - What's this?

1387
00:51:59,233 --> 00:52:01,703
He looks like an elephant with two trunks.

1388
00:52:01,803 --> 00:52:04,333
- These are two trunks. - It's more comfortable that way.

1389
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:06,603
Each neighborhood does it differently.

1390
00:52:06,773 --> 00:52:08,633
I used to hold the nose and the chin.

1391
00:52:08,633 --> 00:52:10,773
(What kind of elephant is that?)

1392
00:52:11,073 --> 00:52:12,103
Get ready.

1393
00:52:12,873 --> 00:52:14,073
- Start. - Turn.

1394
00:52:14,073 --> 00:52:16,273
- 1 and 2. - You're doing well.

1395
00:52:16,273 --> 00:52:17,633
- Three. - Am I doing well?

1396
00:52:17,633 --> 00:52:19,433
- That's enough. - That's good.

1397
00:52:19,433 --> 00:52:20,933
That's good so far.

1398
00:52:20,933 --> 00:52:22,233
Find your balance first.

1399
00:52:23,033 --> 00:52:26,503
(He tries to find balance.)

1400
00:52:27,503 --> 00:52:29,333
(He falls to the ground.)

1401
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:30,903
- He got it. - Okay.

1402
00:52:30,903 --> 00:52:32,433
(His shoe hits the stuffed dog.)

1403
00:52:32,433 --> 00:52:33,933
- It worked. - Did I make it?

1404
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:35,903
(What he did counts as a score.)

1405
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:38,133
- Did it work? - It hit the stuffed dog.

1406
00:52:38,133 --> 00:52:39,873
- It doesn't have to fall. - It's fine as long as it hits it.

1407
00:52:39,873 --> 00:52:43,333
- It counts. - It works as long as it touches it.

1408
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:46,803
The rule of the game is to hit the target with a shoe.

1409
00:52:47,003 --> 00:52:49,173
- Right. - You don't have to knock it down.

1410
00:52:49,173 --> 00:52:52,333
Yes, the rule was to knock down the target.

1411
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:54,333
Is it hitting or knocking down the target?

1412
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:55,333
(What will the producer say?)

1413
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:57,973
- Isn't it hitting? - I told you to hit the target.

1414
00:52:57,973 --> 00:53:00,033
- Wasn't I right? - Wait a minute.

1415
00:53:00,033 --> 00:53:03,033
(Move out of the way.)

1416
00:53:03,033 --> 00:53:05,433
- He hit me. - Wasn't I right?

1417
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:07,703
Did you just hit me?

1418
00:53:07,703 --> 00:53:10,433
- Stop it. - How dare you?

1419
00:53:10,433 --> 00:53:12,503
(Why is he blocking Seok Jin's eye?)

1420
00:53:12,503 --> 00:53:13,703
Listen.

1421
00:53:13,703 --> 00:53:14,903
(Seok Jin gets attacked instead.)

1422
00:53:14,903 --> 00:53:16,973
What are you doing?

1423
00:53:16,973 --> 00:53:18,503
(Ji Hyo turns violent.)

1424
00:53:18,503 --> 00:53:20,403
- It's okay, Ji Hyo. - What happened?

1425
00:53:20,403 --> 00:53:21,873
Good job, Seok Jin.

1426
00:53:21,873 --> 00:53:23,103
(Seok Jin has matured a lot.)

1427
00:53:23,403 --> 00:53:25,433
We beat Seok Jin the most.

1428
00:53:25,433 --> 00:53:27,133
(I'm sorry, Seok Jin.)

1429
00:53:28,003 --> 00:53:33,733
(While everyone else was involved in the fight,)

1430
00:53:34,803 --> 00:53:40,033
(So Min concentrated on counting the money.)

1431
00:53:40,033 --> 00:53:45,933
(She's in a world that's different from everyone else.)

1432
00:53:47,233 --> 00:53:48,973
A fight broke out while I was counting money.

1433
00:53:48,973 --> 00:53:50,003
Don't worry.

1434
00:53:50,873 --> 00:53:53,273
Let's see Se Chan's potential.

1435
00:53:53,273 --> 00:53:54,973
- It's a success if he hits it. - Come on, Se Chan.

1436
00:53:54,973 --> 00:53:56,173
Start.

1437
00:53:56,173 --> 00:53:57,503
(He does his best.)

1438
00:53:57,633 --> 00:54:00,203
- That's a good speed. - Three.

1439
00:54:00,273 --> 00:54:02,033
That's a great speed.

1440
00:54:02,033 --> 00:54:04,173
Calm down before you throw the shoe.

1441
00:54:04,173 --> 00:54:11,033
(They clear the mission if Se Chan succeeds.)

1442
00:54:11,033 --> 00:54:13,903
(Jong Kook's eyes sparkle in hope.)

1443
00:54:13,903 --> 00:54:16,603
(Will Se Chan succeed?)

1444
00:54:16,603 --> 00:54:17,603
He made it.

1445
00:54:17,603 --> 00:54:20,233
(The stuffed dog is knocked down.)

1446
00:54:21,173 --> 00:54:22,233
(It's a definite success.)

1447
00:54:22,233 --> 00:54:23,603
Look, Jong Kook.

1448
00:54:24,033 --> 00:54:26,133
- I knew you could do it. - It's possible.

1449
00:54:26,133 --> 00:54:28,033
- It's definitely possible. - He made it.

1450
00:54:28,033 --> 00:54:30,073
We clear the mission if Haha succeeds.

1451
00:54:30,073 --> 00:54:32,933
Haha, you're the abnormal one.

1452
00:54:32,933 --> 00:54:34,633
(Did he call me abnormal?)

1453
00:54:34,633 --> 00:54:36,503
He called Haha abnormal.

1454
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:38,403
This isn't a big deal.

1455
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,003
- It's possible. - Am I the last one?

1456
00:54:40,003 --> 00:54:41,533
- Give it a try. - Do you want another chance?

1457
00:54:41,533 --> 00:54:42,903
- Do you want to try? - Does he get another chance?

1458
00:54:42,903 --> 00:54:44,073
You should pay us.

1459
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:48,133
(You should pay us.)

1460
00:54:48,133 --> 00:54:50,533
We'll also give you another chance.

1461
00:54:50,533 --> 00:54:53,333
- Of course. - We should keep the promise.

1462
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:54,773
If they give us another chance,

1463
00:54:54,773 --> 00:54:56,933
- we'll also give them a chance. - They must pay for it.

1464
00:54:57,133 --> 00:54:59,533
So Min, don't hesitate so much.

1465
00:54:59,533 --> 00:55:00,773
- I see you. - It's give and take.

1466
00:55:00,773 --> 00:55:02,603
Make them pay 30 dollars.

1467
00:55:02,603 --> 00:55:04,033
(They finish discussing.)

1468
00:55:04,033 --> 00:55:06,803
Pay us 30 dollars for another chance.

1469
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,033
We had a discussion.

1470
00:55:08,033 --> 00:55:10,273
(Pay us 30 dollars in advance.)

1471
00:55:11,303 --> 00:55:15,003
Instead of paying, we'll give you a chance if you fail.

1472
00:55:15,003 --> 00:55:17,933
- No, we'll pay for it. - Isn't that better? No way.

1473
00:55:17,933 --> 00:55:20,273
- Let's pay 20 dollars. - Give us a discount.

1474
00:55:20,273 --> 00:55:22,173
- Just pay 20 dollars. - Let's do it.

1475
00:55:22,173 --> 00:55:24,933
- It's your mistake. - You should pay them.

1476
00:55:25,503 --> 00:55:26,973
Come on.

1477
00:55:26,973 --> 00:55:29,533
They're bullying me, aren't they?

1478
00:55:29,833 --> 00:55:32,073
- Come here. - Listen.

1479
00:55:32,133 --> 00:55:34,173
It'll be strange if I pay them, so you should pay them.

1480
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,733
You should pay them.

1481
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:39,273
(Jong Kook is careful about saving his face.)

1482
00:55:39,273 --> 00:55:40,903
Shouldn't I report them?

1483
00:55:40,903 --> 00:55:42,873
Please say something, SBS!

1484
00:55:42,873 --> 00:55:46,133
Come here, Haha. I'll make a comment.

1485
00:55:46,133 --> 00:55:47,133
(Jong Kook directs Haha.)

1486
00:55:47,133 --> 00:55:48,173
Say this.

1487
00:55:48,173 --> 00:55:51,873
"I'll pay 20 dollars because it was my mistake."

1488
00:55:51,873 --> 00:55:53,433
- Tell them. - Wait here.

1489
00:55:53,633 --> 00:55:55,603
- Listen. - It should be edited.

1490
00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:56,733
Please give him a chance.

1491
00:55:56,733 --> 00:55:57,833
- Pardon me? - Give him a chance.

1492
00:55:57,833 --> 00:55:59,333
- Then pay us 20 dollars. - 20 dollars?

1493
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:01,273
Why are you playing along?

1494
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:03,073
- You're not on his team. - He asked us.

1495
00:56:03,073 --> 00:56:04,073
(Do whatever you want.)

1496
00:56:04,073 --> 00:56:05,433
We'll get five dollars each.

1497
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:07,973
- They're asking for 20 dollars. - What should we do?

1498
00:56:07,973 --> 00:56:09,933
- We don't have money. - Only Haha made a mistake.

1499
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:11,033
That's true.

1500
00:56:11,033 --> 00:56:13,533
What Seok Jin did doesn't count.

1501
00:56:13,533 --> 00:56:15,173
- Let's ask him for 10 dollars. - Right.

1502
00:56:15,173 --> 00:56:16,733
- It wasn't proper. - Pay 10 dollars.

1503
00:56:16,733 --> 00:56:18,703
- I hit it. - It wasn't knocked down.

1504
00:56:18,703 --> 00:56:19,703
It got moved.

1505
00:56:19,703 --> 00:56:21,833
You didn't knock it down.

1506
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:24,533
- Tell him. - Listen to me, everyone.

1507
00:56:24,533 --> 00:56:25,533
(Pushing)

1508
00:56:25,533 --> 00:56:26,533
(Jae Seok screams.)

1509
00:56:26,533 --> 00:56:28,803
- Look. - Did he hit you?

1510
00:56:28,803 --> 00:56:30,933
Did you hit Jae Seok?

1511
00:56:30,973 --> 00:56:32,503
- No. - Did you hit him?

1512
00:56:32,503 --> 00:56:34,833
Did you hit him with your finger?

1513
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:36,603
(Haha's 20 dollars leads to a fight.)

1514
00:56:36,603 --> 00:56:38,533
I'll just pay 20 dollars.

1515
00:56:38,533 --> 00:56:41,433
(Haha gives in.)

1516
00:56:41,433 --> 00:56:42,703
Stop fighting.

1517
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:46,003
Give us 20 dollars.

1518
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:48,773
Is this a gangster show?

1519
00:56:48,873 --> 00:56:51,073
- Give it to me. - Give us 20 dollars.

1520
00:56:51,073 --> 00:56:52,833
(Haha gets another chance in the end.)

1521
00:56:53,233 --> 00:56:54,573
It's Haha's last chance.

1522
00:56:54,703 --> 00:56:56,533
Haha paid 20 dollars for it.

1523
00:56:56,533 --> 00:56:57,873
Get ready.

1524
00:56:57,873 --> 00:56:59,433
- Set, go. - It's for 50 dollars.

1525
00:56:59,433 --> 00:57:01,803
- 1, 2, 3. - That's great.

1526
00:57:01,803 --> 00:57:03,373
- He's doing well. - Four.

1527
00:57:03,373 --> 00:57:05,003
- That's the last turn. - Five.

1528
00:57:05,003 --> 00:57:06,003
Focus.

1529
00:57:06,003 --> 00:57:07,733
- Take your time. - One,

1530
00:57:07,773 --> 00:57:09,903
- 2, 3. - He got it.

1531
00:57:09,903 --> 00:57:12,503
(Their fate depends on Haha's shoe.)

1532
00:57:12,503 --> 00:57:18,003
(If he fails, they must pay 50 dollars.)

1533
00:57:20,173 --> 00:57:21,733
(He fails.)

1534
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:23,533
There's something wrong with my foot.

1535
00:57:24,173 --> 00:57:26,903
(Did he fail again?)

1536
00:57:27,633 --> 00:57:29,703
There's something wrong with my foot.

1537
00:57:29,703 --> 00:57:32,133
- Goodness. - My foot was wrong.

1538
00:57:32,133 --> 00:57:34,033
Haha is terrible.

1539
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,603
(What should I do with him?)

1540
00:57:37,303 --> 00:57:39,973
Team Jong Kook failed.

1541
00:57:39,973 --> 00:57:41,803
Pay 50 dollars to the other team.

1542
00:57:43,773 --> 00:57:45,773
The team that chose Shouting Speed Quiz...

1543
00:57:45,773 --> 00:57:48,003
must answer 10 questions in 100 seconds.

1544
00:57:48,003 --> 00:57:51,233
- How many questions? - 100m isn't a short distance.

1545
00:57:51,233 --> 00:57:52,233
Get ready.

1546
00:57:52,833 --> 00:57:55,903
It's three people including Seok Jin and Jae Seok.

1547
00:57:55,903 --> 00:57:57,173
We can't hear you.

1548
00:57:57,233 --> 00:57:58,803
- It has four syllables. - Unlucky ones?

1549
00:57:58,803 --> 00:58:00,433
- What's this? - What is your name?

1550
00:58:00,433 --> 00:58:02,173
- It's a movie starring Emma Watson. - What is it?

1551
00:58:02,173 --> 00:58:03,703
We can't hear you.

1552
00:58:04,333 --> 00:58:05,973
(They fail the mission.)

1553
00:58:05,973 --> 00:58:07,473
The time is up.

1554
00:58:09,003 --> 00:58:11,073
Let's go to the next location.

1555
00:58:11,073 --> 00:58:12,133
It's time to eat.

1556
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:14,503
(Mission fees that members currently have)

1557
00:58:15,133 --> 00:58:16,133
What's this?

1558
00:58:16,133 --> 00:58:17,133
(O Restaurant in Ulsan)

1559
00:58:17,873 --> 00:58:19,133
(It's a feast.)

1560
00:58:19,133 --> 00:58:20,673
- Does everyone get to eat it? - Gosh.

1561
00:58:21,233 --> 00:58:23,533
(It's Eonyang bulgogi, a specialty dish in Ulsan.)

1562
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:24,933
I want this one.

1563
00:58:25,073 --> 00:58:29,003
(It's finely minced beef cooked in savory sauce.)

1564
00:58:29,033 --> 00:58:31,003
Does everyone get to eat it?

1565
00:58:31,003 --> 00:58:32,133
(What's going on there?)

1566
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,273
I'll sit here.

1567
00:58:33,273 --> 00:58:35,433
(Simple meals are set up in one corner.)

1568
00:58:35,433 --> 00:58:36,733
What's going on?

1569
00:58:36,733 --> 00:58:38,633
It doesn't matter where you sit.

1570
00:58:38,633 --> 00:58:39,833
- Okay. - Pardon me?

1571
00:58:40,273 --> 00:58:43,503
Take a seat first. We'll eat based on the game result.

1572
00:58:44,003 --> 00:58:46,633
Here's the mission where you get a chance...

1573
00:58:46,633 --> 00:58:49,273
to taste Ulsan's specialty, Eonyang bulgogi.

1574
00:58:50,373 --> 00:58:54,103
The other team will decide how much you can spend.

1575
00:58:54,103 --> 00:58:56,403
You can select the menu according to the amount.

1576
00:58:56,603 --> 00:58:58,903
It's the same rule as before.

1577
00:58:58,903 --> 00:59:01,033
The other team decides how much you can spend.

1578
00:59:01,033 --> 00:59:03,333
You eat according to the amount.

1579
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:06,803
(The other team determines the amount you can spend.)

1580
00:59:07,173 --> 00:59:09,603
- We must be careful. - You're right.

1581
00:59:10,003 --> 00:59:11,003
Give it to us.

1582
00:59:11,633 --> 00:59:12,873
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1583
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:14,733
Don't think too much.

1584
00:59:14,733 --> 00:59:17,403
It's more upsetting if things turn out bad after thinking hard.

1585
00:59:17,403 --> 00:59:18,473
Let's do it.

1586
00:59:18,603 --> 00:59:20,273
Just follow our intuition.

1587
00:59:20,433 --> 00:59:22,703
Let's do it separately.

1588
00:59:22,703 --> 00:59:25,133
- There's no strategy for this. - Okay.

1589
00:59:25,133 --> 00:59:26,273
- It's one. - Let's put them randomly.

1590
00:59:26,273 --> 00:59:28,873
Leave it up to the expert.

1591
00:59:28,873 --> 00:59:29,973
That's right.

1592
00:59:29,973 --> 00:59:31,403
Don't show me the other chart.

1593
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:33,533
Which team would like to choose first?

1594
00:59:33,533 --> 00:59:35,233
- The other team. - The other team.

1595
00:59:35,233 --> 00:59:37,873
Let's make them eat a bowl of rice.

1596
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:40,403
Which number do you choose for the amount?

1597
00:59:40,403 --> 00:59:42,503
- Is the amount for us? - Which number do you choose?

1598
00:59:42,503 --> 00:59:43,773
(Which number?)

1599
00:59:44,133 --> 00:59:45,873
We don't know which one.

1600
00:59:45,933 --> 00:59:47,273
We can't react, right?

1601
00:59:47,273 --> 00:59:49,233
- Let's go for number four. - Okay.

1602
00:59:49,233 --> 00:59:51,403
(Kwang Soo trusts So Min's choice.)

1603
00:59:51,603 --> 00:59:53,433
We choose number four for the amount.

1604
00:59:53,433 --> 00:59:55,273
- Number four? - Show us the amount first.

1605
00:59:55,273 --> 00:59:56,933
- Shall we? - What's the amount?

1606
00:59:56,933 --> 00:59:57,973
Let it be 50 dollars.

1607
00:59:57,973 --> 00:59:59,033
(They're desperate.)

1608
00:59:59,033 --> 01:00:00,633
- How much is it? - Goodness.

1609
01:00:00,633 --> 01:00:01,633
What is it?

1610
01:00:01,633 --> 01:00:03,233
(Team Jong Kook has to pay the amount.)

1611
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:05,873
(How much will they have to pay?)

1612
01:00:05,873 --> 01:00:07,303
- What is it? - It's 50 dollars.

1613
01:00:08,233 --> 01:00:10,773
(They pick the maximum amount.)

1614
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:12,503
Okay!

1615
01:00:12,773 --> 01:00:15,003
That's unlike you, Kwang Soo.

1616
01:00:15,003 --> 01:00:16,033
(It was So Min's idea.)

1617
01:00:16,033 --> 01:00:17,603
- It's okay. - Who picked number four?

1618
01:00:17,603 --> 01:00:20,773
We can eat Eonyang bulgogi.

1619
01:00:21,233 --> 01:00:23,873
Which number do you choose for the menu?

1620
01:00:23,873 --> 01:00:25,133
We can eat Eonyang bulgogi.

1621
01:00:25,873 --> 01:00:26,873
So Min?

1622
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:28,403
Number one?

1623
01:00:28,733 --> 01:00:29,903
- Number 1? - Number 1 for the menu?

1624
01:00:29,903 --> 01:00:32,073
- Yes. - We choose number one.

1625
01:00:32,073 --> 01:00:33,273
- Okay. - Is that it?

1626
01:00:33,273 --> 01:00:34,273
It's number one.

1627
01:00:34,273 --> 01:00:35,973
(Which menu will Team Jong Kook get?)

1628
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,173
What is it?

1629
01:00:38,673 --> 01:00:40,103
What is it? No way.

1630
01:00:40,633 --> 01:00:44,433
(Will it be crispy Eonyang bulgogi?)

1631
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:47,503
(Or will it be rice with dried laver?)

1632
01:00:49,073 --> 01:00:51,233
(We can't tell by his face.)

1633
01:00:51,703 --> 01:00:53,703
- It's not bad. - It's doenjang noodles.

1634
01:00:53,703 --> 01:00:55,273
It's doenjang noodles for four.

1635
01:00:55,603 --> 01:00:56,973
(We can't eat bulgogi?)

1636
01:00:56,973 --> 01:00:58,133
Doenjang noodles?

1637
01:00:58,133 --> 01:01:01,133
(Team Jong Kook gets doenjang noodles and pays 50 dollars.)

1638
01:01:01,703 --> 01:01:03,933
(They can't eat bulgogi.)

1639
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:07,033
- That's not bad. - No.

1640
01:01:07,033 --> 01:01:09,403
(They'll be having noodles at a bulgogi restaurant.)

1641
01:01:09,403 --> 01:01:10,403
How about us?

1642
01:01:10,403 --> 01:01:12,273
Let's have them pay 50 dollars for rice.

1643
01:01:12,273 --> 01:01:13,273
Okay.

1644
01:01:13,273 --> 01:01:14,973
There's always the worst.

1645
01:01:14,973 --> 01:01:16,973
We chose number four twice last time.

1646
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:18,433
- How about 1 for both? - Number 1?

1647
01:01:18,433 --> 01:01:20,933
- Food is very important. - Let's pick number one.

1648
01:01:20,933 --> 01:01:22,833
(They choose number 1.)

1649
01:01:23,533 --> 01:01:25,403
- Number 1? - Number 1 for the amount.

1650
01:01:25,633 --> 01:01:26,633
(How much was it?)

1651
01:01:26,633 --> 01:01:27,773
The amount is...

1652
01:01:27,773 --> 01:01:32,133
(How much did Team Jae Seok bet for number 1?)

1653
01:01:32,173 --> 01:01:33,403
Go ahead.

1654
01:01:33,403 --> 01:01:35,633
- It's 50 dollars. - Goodness.

1655
01:01:36,133 --> 01:01:38,233
(They're all happy.)

1656
01:01:38,873 --> 01:01:40,473
(50 dollars...)

1657
01:01:40,633 --> 01:01:41,733
Is it really 50 dollars?

1658
01:01:42,033 --> 01:01:43,133
Is it really 50 dollars?

1659
01:01:43,373 --> 01:01:46,603
(They're great at wishing each other bad luck.)

1660
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:48,633
I got goose bumps.

1661
01:01:48,633 --> 01:01:50,673
Let's just go with number one.

1662
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:52,333
- Let's go with number 1. - Number 1?

1663
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:54,473
His face didn't look good when we kept saying number one.

1664
01:01:54,473 --> 01:01:55,603
- Let's do number 1. - Number 1.

1665
01:01:56,133 --> 01:01:59,103
(Earlier, they were deciding to choose number 1,)

1666
01:01:59,103 --> 01:02:01,933
(and he looked very worried.)

1667
01:02:02,133 --> 01:02:03,673
- His face didn't look good. - Number one.

1668
01:02:03,873 --> 01:02:05,033
- Number 1. - Number 1.

1669
01:02:05,033 --> 01:02:06,703
(Are they flustered?)

1670
01:02:06,703 --> 01:02:08,573
(Or are they acting?)

1671
01:02:08,573 --> 01:02:11,373
(There's Ulsan's Eonyang bulgogi in front of them.)

1672
01:02:11,573 --> 01:02:14,233
(Number 1 is...)

1673
01:02:14,233 --> 01:02:17,003
(What did Team Jong Kook choose?)

1674
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:18,633
Please.

1675
01:02:29,087 --> 01:02:30,587
His face didn't look good...

1676
01:02:31,387 --> 01:02:32,947
- when we kept saying number 1. - Number 1.

1677
01:02:33,047 --> 01:02:34,317
- Number 1. - Number 1.

1678
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:37,217
(Jae Seok's face is unreadable.)

1679
01:02:38,247 --> 01:02:41,787
(They might only get rice at an Eonyang bulgogi restaurant.)

1680
01:02:41,787 --> 01:02:44,887
(What will happen to Team Jae Seok?)

1681
01:02:45,217 --> 01:02:46,217
Please.

1682
01:02:46,217 --> 01:02:47,747
Let's eat together.

1683
01:02:47,747 --> 01:02:50,647
(4 more doenjang noodles please.)

1684
01:02:50,647 --> 01:02:52,647
- We get the same. - This is perfect.

1685
01:02:52,647 --> 01:02:54,217
Let's pay for it.

1686
01:02:54,217 --> 01:02:55,887
This is war.

1687
01:02:55,887 --> 01:02:57,587
- Okay, this is war. - Can you take everything else?

1688
01:02:57,587 --> 01:02:59,687
This is war. It's war.

1689
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:01,247
- Fine. - This is war.

1690
01:03:01,247 --> 01:03:02,847
Can you take everything but doenjang noodles?

1691
01:03:02,947 --> 01:03:05,587
I'm just happy to see that they're not happy.

1692
01:03:05,587 --> 01:03:07,117
We have to pay 50 dollars for doenjang noodles?

1693
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,787
- It's too expensive. - Good.

1694
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:12,217
We're at an Eonyang bulgogi place,

1695
01:03:12,217 --> 01:03:13,447
and we can't even have meat.

1696
01:03:13,447 --> 01:03:15,017
I really wanted it.

1697
01:03:15,017 --> 01:03:16,447
I want some bulgogi.

1698
01:03:17,447 --> 01:03:19,117
Gosh. We almost had it.

1699
01:03:19,117 --> 01:03:21,017
(They're all depressed.)

1700
01:03:21,017 --> 01:03:22,987
I had instant noodles and now I'm having this.

1701
01:03:22,987 --> 01:03:25,887
(Slurping)

1702
01:03:27,247 --> 01:03:28,247
It's good.

1703
01:03:28,247 --> 01:03:29,747
(Their attitude change.)

1704
01:03:29,747 --> 01:03:30,817
(Slurping)

1705
01:03:31,687 --> 01:03:32,947
(It's good.)

1706
01:03:32,947 --> 01:03:33,987
It's good.

1707
01:03:33,987 --> 01:03:35,987
- It's really good. - It suits my appetite.

1708
01:03:35,987 --> 01:03:37,387
(They're satisfied with just doenjang noodles.)

1709
01:03:37,487 --> 01:03:39,487
How did we end up choosing the same?

1710
01:03:39,717 --> 01:03:42,247
At least I feel better that we're eating the same thing.

1711
01:03:42,247 --> 01:03:43,917
- We're not jealous. - I know.

1712
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:45,887
Can I have 50 dollars from each team?

1713
01:03:46,747 --> 01:03:47,787
Let's do rock, paper, scissors.

1714
01:03:47,787 --> 01:03:49,917
Can you exclude me? I have too little money left.

1715
01:03:49,917 --> 01:03:51,847
Hey, I don't have much either.

1716
01:03:51,847 --> 01:03:53,347
- How much do you have? - We can't do that.

1717
01:03:53,347 --> 01:03:54,987
Se Chan, I gave you 10 dollars earlier.

1718
01:03:54,987 --> 01:03:56,147
Let's do this then.

1719
01:03:56,147 --> 01:03:57,487
We'll split 2 to 1 to 1 to 1.

1720
01:03:57,487 --> 01:03:58,687
- 2 to 1 to 1 to 1. - Okay.

1721
01:03:58,687 --> 01:04:01,017
(They listen to Jong Kook right away.)

1722
01:04:01,017 --> 01:04:02,387
- Rock... - Only one person will pay more.

1723
01:04:02,387 --> 01:04:05,087
- Rock, paper, scissors - Rock, paper, scissors

1724
01:04:05,747 --> 01:04:07,417
(Haha gets to pay 20 dollars.)

1725
01:04:07,417 --> 01:04:08,487
Okay.

1726
01:04:08,487 --> 01:04:10,187
That's 20 dollars. We pay 10 dollars.

1727
01:04:10,187 --> 01:04:11,517
- Put it here. - I can still survive.

1728
01:04:11,517 --> 01:04:14,317
It's good because the person with more money keeps on paying.

1729
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:16,017
We're very democratic.

1730
01:04:16,017 --> 01:04:17,187
We're very...

1731
01:04:17,287 --> 01:04:18,417
This is peace.

1732
01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:19,687
(He glances at Jong Kook.)

1733
01:04:19,687 --> 01:04:20,747
This is peace.

1734
01:04:20,747 --> 01:04:22,317
Does this look like democracy to you?

1735
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:23,817
- Of course. - We're very democratic.

1736
01:04:24,287 --> 01:04:26,247
(It sounds more like Jong Kook's words are the law.)

1737
01:04:26,347 --> 01:04:30,147
Jae Seok, democracy is when its citizens are satisfied.

1738
01:04:30,147 --> 01:04:31,787
That sounds nice.

1739
01:04:31,787 --> 01:04:33,587
(You are great.)

1740
01:04:34,087 --> 01:04:35,787
(Democracy is great.)

1741
01:04:35,787 --> 01:04:38,587
Let's do rock, paper, scissors and have two people pay.

1742
01:04:38,687 --> 01:04:40,517
What do you say? Let's do rock, paper, scissors...

1743
01:04:40,517 --> 01:04:42,817
- and save two people. - But we have so little.

1744
01:04:42,817 --> 01:04:45,447
I just need 11 dollars to escape.

1745
01:04:45,447 --> 01:04:47,287
I'll start living a new life.

1746
01:04:47,887 --> 01:04:49,387
Jae Seok,

1747
01:04:49,387 --> 01:04:50,887
- I'll work harder. - Then...

1748
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,947
Then can you two...

1749
01:04:52,947 --> 01:04:54,387
pay 10 dollars together?

1750
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:58,317
(So Min and he will pay 40 dollars.)

1751
01:04:58,587 --> 01:04:59,947
- 10 dollars? - Yes.

1752
01:05:00,217 --> 01:05:03,047
I can afford 10 dollars,

1753
01:05:03,187 --> 01:05:06,347
but if I can get 11 dollars, I can pay back my loan.

1754
01:05:07,347 --> 01:05:08,417
I...

1755
01:05:09,487 --> 01:05:11,947
I wasn't going to say this, but...

1756
01:05:12,017 --> 01:05:14,547
my mom became a victim of a spam call not long ago.

1757
01:05:15,317 --> 01:05:18,987
(This is a true story.)

1758
01:05:19,747 --> 01:05:21,447
- I wasn't going to mention this. - We should pay for him.

1759
01:05:21,547 --> 01:05:22,847
I'll pay.

1760
01:05:23,487 --> 01:05:24,817
(We should pay for him.)

1761
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:26,717
(I'll pay.)

1762
01:05:27,147 --> 01:05:29,687
(He's touched.)

1763
01:05:31,347 --> 01:05:32,717
I'll only pay 10 dollars.

1764
01:05:33,587 --> 01:05:36,617
What are you doing?

1765
01:05:36,687 --> 01:05:39,447
You're only paying 10 dollars?

1766
01:05:39,447 --> 01:05:42,017
Let's pay 25 dollars each.

1767
01:05:42,547 --> 01:05:45,587
- 25 dollars? - Yes.

1768
01:05:46,847 --> 01:05:48,687
You're paying half each, So Min.

1769
01:05:49,387 --> 01:05:51,247
(That was a very fair suggestion.)

1770
01:05:51,917 --> 01:05:53,047
Why do you sound...

1771
01:05:53,047 --> 01:05:55,917
Hold on. Did I do something wrong? I was actually thinking about it.

1772
01:05:56,947 --> 01:05:58,547
- What's wrong? - Even I...

1773
01:05:58,547 --> 01:06:00,247
- Why did she sound surprised? - I thought...

1774
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:02,217
I made a difficult suggestion.

1775
01:06:02,347 --> 01:06:04,717
Can we do rock, paper, scissors and have one person pay?

1776
01:06:05,647 --> 01:06:07,987
(So Min makes a daring suggestion.)

1777
01:06:07,987 --> 01:06:09,487
- That's intense. - That's good.

1778
01:06:09,487 --> 01:06:10,617
Good one, So Min.

1779
01:06:10,617 --> 01:06:12,247
She's good in this.

1780
01:06:12,247 --> 01:06:13,787
- That's what I like about her. - Me too.

1781
01:06:13,787 --> 01:06:15,017
- So Min. - Okay.

1782
01:06:15,017 --> 01:06:16,187
What are you going to do?

1783
01:06:16,647 --> 01:06:18,387
- I can't tell. - What are you going to do?

1784
01:06:18,447 --> 01:06:19,547
I can't say.

1785
01:06:19,547 --> 01:06:22,717
She gets too scary when it comes to money.

1786
01:06:23,147 --> 01:06:25,647
Even last time, Kwang Soo and she...

1787
01:06:26,917 --> 01:06:28,117
(She abandoned Kwang Soo because he didn't have any money.)

1788
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:29,847
But I have some.

1789
01:06:29,987 --> 01:06:30,987
- You do? - You have money?

1790
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,217
- How much do you have? - I lied...

1791
01:06:32,217 --> 01:06:33,717
to you earlier.

1792
01:06:34,247 --> 01:06:35,787
You... Hey.

1793
01:06:36,347 --> 01:06:39,687
(So Min lied to Kwang Soo before.)

1794
01:06:39,747 --> 01:06:41,447
It's one round.

1795
01:06:41,447 --> 01:06:42,447
(Her opponent is Jae Seok this time.)

1796
01:06:42,447 --> 01:06:43,617
Wait a second.

1797
01:06:43,787 --> 01:06:45,017
That thing...

1798
01:06:45,587 --> 01:06:46,887
- Don't open it. - Okay.

1799
01:06:47,117 --> 01:06:48,287
Number of grains?

1800
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:50,447
Whoever picks the bowl with more grains left wins, okay?

1801
01:06:50,447 --> 01:06:52,987
Okay. We'll count the number of grains left.

1802
01:06:52,987 --> 01:06:54,347
- The one with more grains wins. - Okay.

1803
01:06:54,347 --> 01:06:55,787
I'll give them to you as is.

1804
01:06:55,817 --> 01:06:57,017
- Don't touch it. - Okay.

1805
01:06:57,717 --> 01:06:59,087
Okay. Right or left?

1806
01:06:59,087 --> 01:07:00,647
- I choose right. - This?

1807
01:07:00,647 --> 01:07:01,787
(So Min chooses the right bowl.)

1808
01:07:01,787 --> 01:07:06,517
(Kwang Soo emptied the 1st bowl in his noodles,)

1809
01:07:06,517 --> 01:07:10,747
(and he emptied the 2nd bowl into So Min's noodles.)

1810
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,817
- This one? - This is mine.

1811
01:07:12,847 --> 01:07:14,217
All right. That one.

1812
01:07:15,587 --> 01:07:17,417
(This is quite intense.)

1813
01:07:17,417 --> 01:07:18,617
- It's by the number of grains. - Yes, it is.

1814
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:19,887
- Including the lid, okay? - Okay.

1815
01:07:19,887 --> 01:07:21,217
The person with more grains wins, right?

1816
01:07:21,217 --> 01:07:22,347
One, two, three.

1817
01:07:22,347 --> 01:07:23,387
(The winner won't have to pay,)

1818
01:07:23,387 --> 01:07:25,547
(and the loser has to pay 50 dollars.)

1819
01:07:25,547 --> 01:07:26,887
(Who is going to pay today?)

1820
01:07:26,887 --> 01:07:28,117
One, two, three.

1821
01:07:29,347 --> 01:07:31,787
(So Min is the winner.)

1822
01:07:32,387 --> 01:07:34,587
(She has a bunch.)

1823
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:35,947
Thank you for the food, Jae Seok.

1824
01:07:35,947 --> 01:07:37,517
- Thank you for the food. - This isn't it.

1825
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:40,447
(Thank you for the food.)

1826
01:07:40,447 --> 01:07:41,447
This isn't it.

1827
01:07:41,887 --> 01:07:43,747
- Let's do rock, paper, scissors. - No way.

1828
01:07:43,747 --> 01:07:45,347
- Let's do rock, paper, scissors. - Then...

1829
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:48,347
give me 10 dollars. I'll do rock, paper, scissors.

1830
01:07:50,487 --> 01:07:53,687
(Give me 10 dollars, and I'll do you a favor.)

1831
01:07:54,617 --> 01:07:57,847
(That was a good one.)

1832
01:07:57,847 --> 01:07:59,547
She learns very fast.

1833
01:07:59,547 --> 01:08:00,657
(She gets scarier and scarier.)

1834
01:08:00,657 --> 01:08:01,817
She's too scary.

1835
01:08:03,047 --> 01:08:06,347
(She is controlling Jae Seok.)

1836
01:08:06,347 --> 01:08:08,517
- Jeon So Min... - Stop being like that, So Min.

1837
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:09,687
(So Min adapts very quickly.)

1838
01:08:09,687 --> 01:08:11,417
Hold on. So Min...

1839
01:08:11,417 --> 01:08:12,587
She's no joke, right?

1840
01:08:12,587 --> 01:08:14,747
Good job, So Min. Take all his money.

1841
01:08:14,747 --> 01:08:16,587
I'll do rock, paper, scissors if you pay me 10 dollars.

1842
01:08:16,587 --> 01:08:18,117
(He gives her 10 dollars to get another try.)

1843
01:08:18,117 --> 01:08:20,447
I don't know if I'm doing the right thing.

1844
01:08:20,587 --> 01:08:21,947
- You can win this time. - It's a single round.

1845
01:08:21,947 --> 01:08:23,547
Yes, that's right. It's a single round.

1846
01:08:24,187 --> 01:08:25,287
Yes.

1847
01:08:25,287 --> 01:08:28,047
(I can't get swayed.)

1848
01:08:28,047 --> 01:08:31,547
(He faces her with his own strategy.)

1849
01:08:31,547 --> 01:08:32,747
So Min is strong.

1850
01:08:32,747 --> 01:08:34,157
Rock, paper, scissors!

1851
01:08:35,017 --> 01:08:36,517
(They're true enemies.)

1852
01:08:36,517 --> 01:08:37,987
Rock, paper, scissors!

1853
01:08:37,987 --> 01:08:39,347
(Jae Seok and So Min are trying to make each other pay.)

1854
01:08:39,347 --> 01:08:41,547
(Who will win this time?)

1855
01:08:41,547 --> 01:08:43,047
Rock, paper, scissors!

1856
01:08:43,587 --> 01:08:44,917
(So Min was going to win anyways.)

1857
01:08:44,917 --> 01:08:46,217
Rock, paper, scissors!

1858
01:08:50,117 --> 01:08:53,347
(Lunch is on Jae Seok today.)

1859
01:08:53,347 --> 01:08:56,517
- Jeon So Min. - Jeon So Min.

1860
01:08:56,517 --> 01:08:57,687
(You should live life like her.)

1861
01:08:57,687 --> 01:08:59,987
- Jeon So Min. - Jeon So Min.

1862
01:08:59,987 --> 01:09:01,287
- This is beautiful. - She's starting to...

1863
01:09:01,287 --> 01:09:03,847
(Boiling)

1864
01:09:03,847 --> 01:09:05,047
This is getting interesting.

1865
01:09:05,047 --> 01:09:06,587
Here's 50 dollars.

1866
01:09:06,587 --> 01:09:07,747
Thank you for the food.

1867
01:09:07,747 --> 01:09:11,017
So Min, you won't get away with this.

1868
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:13,657
(How will this rivalry between Jae Seok and So Min end?)

1869
01:09:13,657 --> 01:09:15,157
She's no joke.

1870
01:09:16,317 --> 01:09:18,347
This is war, So Min.

1871
01:09:18,347 --> 01:09:19,717
Jeon So Min.

1872
01:09:19,717 --> 01:09:21,747
- You're dead, So Min. - This is war.

1873
01:09:21,747 --> 01:09:23,887
You don't know how he is. You're dead.

1874
01:09:23,887 --> 01:09:24,947
- Jong Kook. - He keeps his words.

1875
01:09:24,947 --> 01:09:26,117
- Let's form an alliance. - He keeps his words.

1876
01:09:26,117 --> 01:09:27,917
- It's okay. - So Min.

1877
01:09:27,917 --> 01:09:29,487
I need to bring So Min with me.

1878
01:09:29,817 --> 01:09:32,687
We'll get a few losers in a row.

1879
01:09:32,687 --> 01:09:33,717
(Gimhae Theme Park)

1880
01:09:33,717 --> 01:09:35,747
(Gimhae is known for its rich heritage.)

1881
01:09:35,747 --> 01:09:36,887
Where are we?

1882
01:09:36,887 --> 01:09:38,447
This is fascinating.

1883
01:09:38,887 --> 01:09:41,017
Silla and Gaya...

1884
01:09:41,017 --> 01:09:42,917
(It still has remnants of the Gaya confederacy.)

1885
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:43,947
Baekje...

1886
01:09:44,387 --> 01:09:46,217
Aren't you giving out more Tour Stickers?

1887
01:09:46,217 --> 01:09:48,717
We might give out a lot at the end.

1888
01:09:49,547 --> 01:09:52,717
This is unfair for people with no money.

1889
01:09:52,717 --> 01:09:54,387
People like me. Me and Seok Jin.

1890
01:09:54,387 --> 01:09:55,887
- Yes, I have nothing. - Me neither.

1891
01:09:55,947 --> 01:09:58,617
So we have a special mission.

1892
01:09:58,847 --> 01:10:00,387
It's the Be Irrelevant game.

1893
01:10:01,117 --> 01:10:02,187
(Be Irrelevant game...)

1894
01:10:02,687 --> 01:10:06,347
(is where you provide irrelevant answers to questions.)

1895
01:10:06,347 --> 01:10:07,687
(How do you decompress?)

1896
01:10:07,687 --> 01:10:08,847
(Waterproof device)

1897
01:10:08,847 --> 01:10:10,517
(What is your nickname?)

1898
01:10:10,517 --> 01:10:12,587
(Strict measures will be taken against smoking within the studio.)

1899
01:10:12,587 --> 01:10:14,347
(What is the biggest lie you want to say?)

1900
01:10:14,347 --> 01:10:15,447
(Fire hydrant)

1901
01:10:15,447 --> 01:10:16,847
(This is correct.)

1902
01:10:16,847 --> 01:10:18,517
(What do you want to eat right now?)

1903
01:10:18,517 --> 01:10:21,047
(If your answer makes sense, you're wrong.)

1904
01:10:21,247 --> 01:10:22,687
(What do you call your wife?)

1905
01:10:22,687 --> 01:10:24,417
(Oh Jung Tae)

1906
01:10:24,417 --> 01:10:26,987
(It stirs up many controversies so reporters pay attention to it.)

1907
01:10:26,987 --> 01:10:28,187
This is hard.

1908
01:10:28,187 --> 01:10:29,687
It's different. It's been upgraded.

1909
01:10:29,687 --> 01:10:32,047
You can bet anything from 10 to 50 dollars.

1910
01:10:32,047 --> 01:10:35,117
If you win, we'll give you the amount you win.

1911
01:10:35,117 --> 01:10:37,157
If you lose, you'll get that much deducted.

1912
01:10:37,187 --> 01:10:39,217
Seok Jin is the worst at this game.

1913
01:10:39,347 --> 01:10:42,087
- I'll bet 10 dollars. - That's all-in.

1914
01:10:42,587 --> 01:10:44,947
Set, go.

1915
01:10:44,947 --> 01:10:46,347
What are you most interested in these days?

1916
01:10:46,347 --> 01:10:48,987
Toad.

1917
01:10:49,247 --> 01:10:52,717
(With his loss, the real game starts.)

1918
01:10:52,717 --> 01:10:54,747
Be Irrelevant is so hard.

1919
01:10:54,747 --> 01:10:55,887
He has no money now.

1920
01:10:55,887 --> 01:10:57,917
It actually makes sense.

1921
01:10:58,747 --> 01:10:59,947
- Is it Kwang Soo next? - Yes.

1922
01:10:59,947 --> 01:11:01,617
- I'll bet 10 dollars. - 10 dollars.

1923
01:11:01,617 --> 01:11:02,817
Hey.

1924
01:11:02,817 --> 01:11:04,247
Double the amount. It's okay.

1925
01:11:04,247 --> 01:11:05,617
Bet 22 dollars.

1926
01:11:05,617 --> 01:11:07,517
- You'll be debt free. - That's right.

1927
01:11:07,517 --> 01:11:09,487
- Bet 22 dollars. - Do it.

1928
01:11:09,487 --> 01:11:10,547
I will.

1929
01:11:10,547 --> 01:11:11,787
Fine, I'll do it.

1930
01:11:11,787 --> 01:11:13,447
- You have to be smart. - I'll do it.

1931
01:11:13,447 --> 01:11:15,487
- You must be fair though. - Okay.

1932
01:11:15,717 --> 01:11:18,547
If you win this time, you can pay off your loan.

1933
01:11:18,547 --> 01:11:20,787
Ready, set, go.

1934
01:11:20,787 --> 01:11:22,287
What did you dream about yesterday?

1935
01:11:22,287 --> 01:11:23,387
Don't worry.

1936
01:11:23,387 --> 01:11:25,217
- How do you feel right now? - Kimchi.

1937
01:11:25,217 --> 01:11:27,117
- Few words for your mom? - I love you.

1938
01:11:28,787 --> 01:11:30,657
(I love you, Mom.)

1939
01:11:31,417 --> 01:11:32,847
(He's a good son.)

1940
01:11:32,847 --> 01:11:36,187
You're a good son.

1941
01:11:36,187 --> 01:11:37,547
Go again.

1942
01:11:37,547 --> 01:11:39,987
- He's a good son. - He is.

1943
01:11:39,987 --> 01:11:42,987
This is your last chance. It's fine.

1944
01:11:43,157 --> 01:11:45,947
I'll bet money and play two more times.

1945
01:11:45,947 --> 01:11:47,117
If I lose, I'm done.

1946
01:11:47,187 --> 01:11:50,217
This is how you become bankrupt, right?

1947
01:11:50,447 --> 01:11:51,987
Ready, set, go.

1948
01:11:51,987 --> 01:11:53,587
What do you want to say to our viewers?

1949
01:11:53,587 --> 01:11:54,657
Emergency department.

1950
01:11:54,887 --> 01:11:56,047
What did you dream about yesterday?

1951
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:57,247
Green.

1952
01:11:57,247 --> 01:11:58,387
What do you want to lie about?

1953
01:11:59,087 --> 01:12:00,657
Mimi.

1954
01:12:00,787 --> 01:12:02,017
What do you want to lie about?

1955
01:12:02,747 --> 01:12:03,787
Mimi.

1956
01:12:04,247 --> 01:12:05,417
What's that?

1957
01:12:05,747 --> 01:12:07,887
- Mimi. - What's that?

1958
01:12:07,917 --> 01:12:09,187
Mimi.

1959
01:12:09,187 --> 01:12:11,087
It's the name of the cat I had as a child.

1960
01:12:11,087 --> 01:12:12,947
- You took too long. - I know.

1961
01:12:12,947 --> 01:12:15,087
You took too long.

1962
01:12:15,087 --> 01:12:16,447
- You took too long. - That's right.

1963
01:12:16,787 --> 01:12:18,287
Hey, watch me.

1964
01:12:18,317 --> 01:12:19,487
Bet everything.

1965
01:12:20,417 --> 01:12:21,617
Who'll take the xylophone?

1966
01:12:21,617 --> 01:12:23,547
I will. Who will?

1967
01:12:23,657 --> 01:12:25,847
How much are you going to bet?

1968
01:12:25,847 --> 01:12:28,387
- I'll bet 5 dollars. - Okay, it's 5 dollars.

1969
01:12:28,487 --> 01:12:29,887
Ready,

1970
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:31,117
set, go. What's in your bag right now?

1971
01:12:31,387 --> 01:12:32,787
What do you know?

1972
01:12:32,887 --> 01:12:34,087
What do you want to say to your wife?

1973
01:12:34,087 --> 01:12:36,317
(What do you want to say to your wife?)

1974
01:12:36,447 --> 01:12:37,517
What do you want to say to your wife?

1975
01:12:38,047 --> 01:12:40,347
(He can't answer it this time either.)

1976
01:12:40,347 --> 01:12:42,817
- What's wrong? - What's the problem?

1977
01:12:42,817 --> 01:12:44,987
- Why are you pausing? - It's always his wife.

1978
01:12:44,987 --> 01:12:47,217
- Were you thinking about poop? - Yes.

1979
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:49,017
- I knew it. - Hey.

1980
01:12:49,187 --> 01:12:52,887
I was thinking about poop. Why would you ask that?

1981
01:12:52,987 --> 01:12:54,987
- You should have said it. - This time,

1982
01:12:55,047 --> 01:12:57,417
I bet 11 dollars.

1983
01:12:57,717 --> 01:12:59,247
- 11 dollars. - He's wasting it all.

1984
01:12:59,247 --> 01:13:01,817
- Cue. - Ready, set,

1985
01:13:01,817 --> 01:13:03,447
go. What do you tell your angry wife?

1986
01:13:03,717 --> 01:13:04,787
81.

1987
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:06,847
You can say that.

1988
01:13:07,487 --> 01:13:08,617
(You can say that to your wife.)

1989
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:10,217
- 81... - It's an irrelevant answer.

1990
01:13:10,217 --> 01:13:11,847
- It's irrelevant. - It's true.

1991
01:13:11,847 --> 01:13:14,717
- See? He can't do it. I told you. - Let go.

1992
01:13:14,817 --> 01:13:16,657
- Give it back. - It's my fault.

1993
01:13:17,417 --> 01:13:18,517
(He's mad.)

1994
01:13:18,987 --> 01:13:21,617
Jae Seok, he's not mad at you.

1995
01:13:21,617 --> 01:13:22,987
He's mad at himself.

1996
01:13:23,517 --> 01:13:24,987
(Boiling)

1997
01:13:24,987 --> 01:13:27,487
- Is that right? - I'm just mad at myself.

1998
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:29,157
Okay, that makes sense.

1999
01:13:29,157 --> 01:13:32,617
It's like I'm asking, "Why did I do that?"

2000
01:13:32,717 --> 01:13:34,887
- Don't be so strict on yourself. - Don't.

2001
01:13:34,947 --> 01:13:36,287
You weren't mad at me, right?

2002
01:13:36,517 --> 01:13:39,287
Why would I be mad at you? You didn't do anything wrong.

2003
01:13:39,787 --> 01:13:41,657
That was entirely my fault.

2004
01:13:41,657 --> 01:13:43,587
- All right. Stop being mad. - I'm good.

2005
01:13:43,587 --> 01:13:44,787
You have to do better.

2006
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:46,387
- Do three in a row. - Okay.

2007
01:13:46,387 --> 01:13:48,387
Ready, set,

2008
01:13:48,387 --> 01:13:49,787
go. How old were you when you had your first kiss?

2009
01:13:49,787 --> 01:13:51,947
How could you abandon me?

2010
01:13:51,947 --> 01:13:54,047
How do you comfort your mad wife?

2011
01:13:54,047 --> 01:13:55,517
58.

2012
01:13:56,117 --> 01:13:57,447
Isn't this wrong?

2013
01:13:57,657 --> 01:14:00,747
No, keep going.

2014
01:14:01,017 --> 01:14:03,387
What's wrong with you?

2015
01:14:03,387 --> 01:14:05,157
Why do you keep interrupting?

2016
01:14:05,157 --> 01:14:06,817
- Stop doing that. - What's wrong?

2017
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:08,787
- What's wrong with you? - Hold on.

2018
01:14:08,787 --> 01:14:10,847
- Hold on. Give me a second. - What's wrong with him?

2019
01:14:10,847 --> 01:14:12,657
- And Jae Seok. - Yes?

2020
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:14,417
- When his wife gets mad... - Don't say anything.

2021
01:14:17,587 --> 01:14:19,947
(Can you stop talking?)

2022
01:14:20,617 --> 01:14:21,657
(He gets ordered around by somebody 11 years younger than him.)

2023
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:22,917
- Why? - I...

2024
01:14:23,317 --> 01:14:25,017
I can't even...

2025
01:14:25,087 --> 01:14:27,087
- I'm sorry. - What was that?

2026
01:14:27,247 --> 01:14:28,587
He's the oldest of us all.

2027
01:14:28,587 --> 01:14:30,887
He's not the youngest.

2028
01:14:30,887 --> 01:14:32,617
- He's not. - I'm sorry.

2029
01:14:32,617 --> 01:14:34,657
- He... - That's not it.

2030
01:14:34,657 --> 01:14:36,657
I said that because Jae Seok...

2031
01:14:36,657 --> 01:14:39,517
kept stalling...

2032
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:41,347
- and tries to earn time. - I didn't.

2033
01:14:41,347 --> 01:14:42,747
Then here's your question.

2034
01:14:42,747 --> 01:14:44,687
- Is this my last chance? - It's a mental game this time.

2035
01:14:44,687 --> 01:14:47,887
- Is this my last chance? - Yes, here it is. Ready,

2036
01:14:47,887 --> 01:14:49,617
set, go. Can you say something long to me?

2037
01:14:49,617 --> 01:14:50,657
All right.

2038
01:14:50,787 --> 01:14:51,847
Something short?

2039
01:14:51,847 --> 01:14:53,117
What's that?

2040
01:14:53,747 --> 01:14:56,887
- He knows he's wrong. - My gosh.

2041
01:14:57,517 --> 01:15:00,317
- This is driving me crazy. - He's so nice.

2042
01:15:00,487 --> 01:15:03,487
- He actually said something short. - My gosh.

2043
01:15:03,787 --> 01:15:05,747
- Who's next? - It's So Min's turn.

2044
01:15:05,987 --> 01:15:07,317
I'll bet 20 dollars.

2045
01:15:07,317 --> 01:15:08,387
- Really? - Yes.

2046
01:15:08,687 --> 01:15:10,517
Ready, set, go.

2047
01:15:10,517 --> 01:15:11,747
What is your favorite number?

2048
01:15:11,747 --> 01:15:12,917
Shipping and pick up.

2049
01:15:12,917 --> 01:15:14,017
What do you want to say to Kwang Soo?

2050
01:15:14,417 --> 01:15:15,547
You...

2051
01:15:15,547 --> 01:15:17,887
(Kwang Soo, you...)

2052
01:15:18,517 --> 01:15:20,317
- No... - Hey.

2053
01:15:21,157 --> 01:15:23,187
- Hey. - That was wrong.

2054
01:15:23,187 --> 01:15:24,947
- This... - Come on.

2055
01:15:24,947 --> 01:15:26,487
That sounds unpleasant.

2056
01:15:26,487 --> 01:15:27,617
I'll bet 12 dollars.

2057
01:15:27,617 --> 01:15:29,717
- Haha bets 12 dollars. - Okay.

2058
01:15:30,087 --> 01:15:33,717
Ready, set, go.

2059
01:15:33,717 --> 01:15:35,547
- What do you want to lie about? - 23.

2060
01:15:35,987 --> 01:15:38,187
- What is your favorite number? - You're so funny.

2061
01:15:38,217 --> 01:15:39,287
What do you want to say to Dream?

2062
01:15:39,287 --> 01:15:42,317
Crying like a baby. Who are you?

2063
01:15:42,587 --> 01:15:43,617
What do you want to say to Dream?

2064
01:15:43,617 --> 01:15:45,947
Crying like a baby. Who are you?

2065
01:15:45,947 --> 01:15:48,287
(What are you doing, Haha?)

2066
01:15:48,287 --> 01:15:49,447
Come on.

2067
01:15:49,447 --> 01:15:53,547
(Who are you, Dream?)

2068
01:15:53,547 --> 01:15:55,157
Come on.

2069
01:15:55,287 --> 01:15:56,717
How can you say that to your child?

2070
01:15:57,657 --> 01:15:59,187
It's your child.

2071
01:15:59,387 --> 01:16:01,547
He was trying to stall.

2072
01:16:01,847 --> 01:16:04,047
He was saying, "Crying like a baby," to stall.

2073
01:16:04,047 --> 01:16:05,817
(It's a perfect answer for Dream's age.)

2074
01:16:05,817 --> 01:16:07,787
He was saying it to Dream.

2075
01:16:07,887 --> 01:16:09,617
Hey, don't you dare.

2076
01:16:09,947 --> 01:16:11,347
Don't talk about my family.

2077
01:16:11,347 --> 01:16:13,687
- Stop mentioning our family. - Why would you do that?

2078
01:16:13,947 --> 01:16:15,987
"Crying like a baby. Who are you?"

2079
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:18,317
"Who are you?"

2080
01:16:18,317 --> 01:16:20,387
I thought he was imitating a comedian.

2081
01:16:22,347 --> 01:16:24,887
- Nature's great, right? - It's wonderful.

2082
01:16:25,917 --> 01:16:27,587
It makes my eyes open wide.

2083
01:16:27,587 --> 01:16:29,687
This is different.

2084
01:16:29,687 --> 01:16:30,717
I feel healthy.

2085
01:16:30,917 --> 01:16:33,417
You should always try to enjoy the nature.

2086
01:16:33,417 --> 01:16:34,887
(What mission awaits them in this spring weather?)

2087
01:16:34,887 --> 01:16:37,417
Everybody, welcome to Gimhae.

2088
01:16:37,417 --> 01:16:39,217
(Welcome to Gimhae.)

2089
01:16:39,217 --> 01:16:40,517
We're in Gimhae.

2090
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:42,487
The palace behind you is a replica of Gaya Royal Palace...

2091
01:16:42,487 --> 01:16:45,787
where King Kim Su Ro lived 2,000 years ago.

2092
01:16:45,787 --> 01:16:53,117
(It's a replica of the palace King Kim Su Ro lived in.)

2093
01:16:53,117 --> 01:16:57,187
Our last race of Dangerous Choices will be in this historical place.

2094
01:16:57,347 --> 01:16:58,687
You have your mission fee, right?

2095
01:16:58,687 --> 01:16:59,787
Of course.

2096
01:16:59,787 --> 01:17:03,117
You can earn more mission fees with Dangerous Shoe Throw.

2097
01:17:04,347 --> 01:17:07,987
(Dangerous Shoe Throw?)

2098
01:17:08,347 --> 01:17:11,117
Steal another member's shoe...

2099
01:17:11,217 --> 01:17:15,117
and throw it on the large board with their names on it.

2100
01:17:15,587 --> 01:17:18,417
(There are 3 boards scattered around.)

2101
01:17:18,617 --> 01:17:21,517
The member whose shoe is thrown on the board is out.

2102
01:17:21,517 --> 01:17:23,317
(If your shoe is on the board, you're out.)

2103
01:17:23,317 --> 01:17:25,887
(You'll be remotely eliminated.)

2104
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:28,617
You can steal half the money that the person has.

2105
01:17:28,617 --> 01:17:30,947
Wait. That's a bit too much.

2106
01:17:31,187 --> 01:17:33,087
Half? We have none.

2107
01:17:33,187 --> 01:17:34,657
- What if you have none? - We have none.

2108
01:17:34,747 --> 01:17:36,547
If you have none, then that's that.

2109
01:17:36,547 --> 01:17:38,887
It's always a gain for us.

2110
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:40,747
(If you eliminate a person with no money, you don't gain anything.)

2111
01:17:40,747 --> 01:17:43,717
However, you shouldn't be happy because you have no money.

2112
01:17:44,347 --> 01:17:46,787
If your shoe lands on the space that reads, "Dud",

2113
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:49,447
you must pay 30 dollars as a penalty and try again.

2114
01:17:49,447 --> 01:17:51,447
- 30 dollars? - Yes. If you have no money,

2115
01:17:51,657 --> 01:17:53,547
you must get a loan.

2116
01:17:54,117 --> 01:17:56,847
There's also a space that reads, "Winner".

2117
01:17:57,317 --> 01:17:59,617
If your shoe lands on that spot,

2118
01:17:59,617 --> 01:18:00,747
that's the end of the race.

2119
01:18:01,687 --> 01:18:03,617
You get 100 dollars as prize money.

2120
01:18:04,217 --> 01:18:05,347
100 dollars?

2121
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:07,847
- We can pay our loans back. - We can do it.

2122
01:18:07,847 --> 01:18:09,987
It'll be hard to steal each other's shoes.

2123
01:18:09,987 --> 01:18:11,157
Since...

2124
01:18:11,247 --> 01:18:12,817
it won't be easy,

2125
01:18:12,817 --> 01:18:16,387
we also hid three shoes somewhere around this area.

2126
01:18:16,617 --> 01:18:19,587
- We have to find it? - Those shoes count too.

2127
01:18:20,587 --> 01:18:24,717
What are you doing? You're already tying your shoelaces?

2128
01:18:25,747 --> 01:18:27,187
(Untying)

2129
01:18:27,617 --> 01:18:29,087
Come on, So Min.

2130
01:18:29,847 --> 01:18:32,847
Look at her. She's untying my shoelaces.

2131
01:18:33,917 --> 01:18:36,887
What is she doing?

2132
01:18:37,657 --> 01:18:40,487
Please separate yourselves and start the mission.

2133
01:18:41,247 --> 01:18:44,117
(Who's going to be the ultimate winner?)

2134
01:18:44,687 --> 01:18:46,917
It won't be easy to steal people's shoes.

2135
01:18:47,447 --> 01:18:50,347
I should look for the hidden shoes.

2136
01:18:50,347 --> 01:18:51,787
(Steal or find the hidden shoes.)

2137
01:18:51,787 --> 01:18:53,817
- I think they'll come off easily. - These?

2138
01:18:55,287 --> 01:18:56,987
They have to touch it in the first place.

2139
01:18:56,987 --> 01:18:58,087
(That's frightening.)

2140
01:18:59,247 --> 01:19:00,587
Do we start here?

2141
01:19:00,587 --> 01:19:02,047
(So Min is a rookie.)

2142
01:19:02,387 --> 01:19:03,487
I'm worried. What do I do?

2143
01:19:03,487 --> 01:19:04,817
(She's half-worried and half-curious.)

2144
01:19:06,157 --> 01:19:07,217
Do we get slippers?

2145
01:19:07,717 --> 01:19:11,087
If you get your shoes stolen, we'll give you a pair.

2146
01:19:11,987 --> 01:19:14,287
I shouldn't hide my shoes, right? It'll be unfair.

2147
01:19:14,717 --> 01:19:16,847
I'm going to get mine stolen quickly.

2148
01:19:16,847 --> 01:19:18,157
(She already knows how to cheat.)

2149
01:19:18,447 --> 01:19:20,717
I just want to steal one shoe.

2150
01:19:21,287 --> 01:19:23,687
I'll lose to Ji Hyo, right?

2151
01:19:24,017 --> 01:19:26,317
Ji Hyo is a woman,

2152
01:19:26,587 --> 01:19:27,717
so I can steal hers.

2153
01:19:29,047 --> 01:19:31,157
(Is that right?)

2154
01:19:32,657 --> 01:19:34,187
I'll count down.

2155
01:19:35,317 --> 01:19:36,847
They're all nearby.

2156
01:19:37,487 --> 01:19:38,987
Kwang Soo is right next to me.

2157
01:19:38,987 --> 01:19:41,517
(He's right next to Jong Kook.)

2158
01:19:41,517 --> 01:19:42,517
(Roaring)

2159
01:19:42,517 --> 01:19:44,047
(Goodness)

2160
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:45,947
Three,

2161
01:19:46,517 --> 01:19:47,747
- 2, - 2,

2162
01:19:48,247 --> 01:19:49,747
One. Start race.

2163
01:19:51,157 --> 01:19:52,487
(Kwang Soo runs for his life.)

2164
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:54,187
Look at Kwang Soo run.

2165
01:19:54,187 --> 01:19:55,747
He's so fast.

2166
01:19:55,747 --> 01:19:56,747
(He's very fast.)

2167
01:19:58,247 --> 01:20:00,317
(I can't catch him.)

2168
01:20:00,317 --> 01:20:03,287
Wait. Where are the shoes?

2169
01:20:03,287 --> 01:20:05,347
I shouldn't let the others find it. I should catch them first.

2170
01:20:06,547 --> 01:20:07,687
(What are the other members doing?)

2171
01:20:07,687 --> 01:20:08,717
Seok Jin.

2172
01:20:09,587 --> 01:20:12,217
The two of us...

2173
01:20:12,217 --> 01:20:14,247
Seok Jin.

2174
01:20:14,387 --> 01:20:16,787
Let's switch shoes...

2175
01:20:16,787 --> 01:20:18,747
with each other and throw them.

2176
01:20:20,417 --> 01:20:21,817
(That's an idea.)

2177
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:23,047
- Should we? - Yes.

2178
01:20:23,217 --> 01:20:24,587
The others are going to steal ours anyways.

2179
01:20:24,587 --> 01:20:26,717
(Haha thinks of ideas so that he can win.)

2180
01:20:26,717 --> 01:20:28,787
- That's a good idea. - Right? Hurry.

2181
01:20:28,787 --> 01:20:30,217
Mine usually don't come off.

2182
01:20:30,217 --> 01:20:31,287
I know but Seok Jin...

2183
01:20:31,287 --> 01:20:32,317
We should both throw them?

2184
01:20:32,317 --> 01:20:34,157
Yes, let's throw both of them.

2185
01:20:34,287 --> 01:20:36,417
- That's actually great. - Yes, it is.

2186
01:20:36,417 --> 01:20:38,487
- If we do this... - Why don't we steal others' first?

2187
01:20:38,487 --> 01:20:39,487
Seok Jin.

2188
01:20:39,817 --> 01:20:41,087
What's up? Are you two a team?

2189
01:20:41,247 --> 01:20:43,217
No, should we form a team?

2190
01:20:43,217 --> 01:20:44,947
- Do you want to be a team? - First of all,

2191
01:20:44,947 --> 01:20:45,947
the four of us should be a team.

2192
01:20:46,017 --> 01:20:47,187
- I don't have anything. - How does that sound?

2193
01:20:47,187 --> 01:20:48,317
- I don't have anything either. - Okay.

2194
01:20:48,317 --> 01:20:50,787
- The thing is... - Then let's attack Jong Kook.

2195
01:20:50,787 --> 01:20:52,017
- Jong Kook? - Yes.

2196
01:20:52,017 --> 01:20:53,917
- Let's get rid of him first. - No, let's finish Jae Seok first.

2197
01:20:53,917 --> 01:20:57,017
Let's work together after we get rid of Jong Kook.

2198
01:20:57,887 --> 01:21:00,387
- Actually, we should do that first. - That's right.

2199
01:21:00,387 --> 01:21:02,947
- We all know how he is. - Okay. We are a team now.

2200
01:21:02,947 --> 01:21:03,987
We are one.

2201
01:21:04,387 --> 01:21:05,847
I'm getting tired of this.

2202
01:21:06,587 --> 01:21:07,887
Let's go at him hard!

2203
01:21:08,047 --> 01:21:11,047
We all don't have any money and you are aware of it, right?

2204
01:21:11,047 --> 01:21:12,187
Of course.

2205
01:21:12,387 --> 01:21:13,887
- That's right. - I have nothing to lose.

2206
01:21:13,887 --> 01:21:15,217
(Person in 1st place is moving with the low ranks.)

2207
01:21:15,417 --> 01:21:18,157
- You have money though, right? - Yes, money doesn't matter though.

2208
01:21:18,157 --> 01:21:20,417
If you go around by yourselves, it's not good for you.

2209
01:21:20,547 --> 01:21:23,587
But who is going to attack Jong Kook first when we see him?

2210
01:21:23,817 --> 01:21:26,347
- It will be Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo will try first.

2211
01:21:27,047 --> 01:21:28,217
Let me see.

2212
01:21:28,487 --> 01:21:29,847
There will be shoes?

2213
01:21:30,047 --> 01:21:34,187
(He opens his eyes wide and starts hurting for shoes.)

2214
01:21:36,047 --> 01:21:37,987
I think it should be somewhere around here.

2215
01:21:37,987 --> 01:21:39,587
(Shoes or members, where are you?)

2216
01:21:42,947 --> 01:21:43,947
There's a shoe.

2217
01:21:46,547 --> 01:21:47,687
(He finds 1 out of 3 hidden shoes.)

2218
01:21:47,687 --> 01:21:51,047
I got it. Let's go. Hurry.

2219
01:21:52,387 --> 01:21:53,847
Jong Kook found something.

2220
01:21:53,847 --> 01:21:54,947
(He goes to kick the shoe.)

2221
01:21:55,117 --> 01:21:57,547
Jae Seok's coming. It'd be great if I can eliminate him.

2222
01:21:59,817 --> 01:22:00,847
Hey.

2223
01:22:01,047 --> 01:22:02,587
- There he is. - There's Jong Kook.

2224
01:22:02,587 --> 01:22:03,817
(Everyone pays attention to his first try.)

2225
01:22:04,287 --> 01:22:06,157
Kick it to the right block. Kick for Kwang Soo.

2226
01:22:06,157 --> 01:22:07,287
Go into Jae Seok block!

2227
01:22:09,687 --> 01:22:13,917
(The owner of the block where the shoe falls will be eliminated.)

2228
01:22:14,387 --> 01:22:15,587
Go into Jae Seok block!

2229
01:22:15,587 --> 01:22:19,447
(What will the decision of Jong Kook's shoe be?)

2230
01:22:21,947 --> 01:22:23,047
Go into Jae Seok block!

2231
01:22:24,587 --> 01:22:27,947
(Seok Jin who has no money is eliminated.)

2232
01:22:28,487 --> 01:22:31,157
Darn it. He doesn't have any money.

2233
01:22:31,157 --> 01:22:33,017
(At this moment, Seok Jin shows up.)

2234
01:22:33,017 --> 01:22:34,887
What happened? I just saw it.

2235
01:22:35,187 --> 01:22:36,287
Hey, what are you doing?

2236
01:22:36,287 --> 01:22:38,487
- You have no money. - He started off the race.

2237
01:22:38,487 --> 01:22:40,487
(Am I eliminated already?)

2238
01:22:40,487 --> 01:22:41,587
Is it over for me?

2239
01:22:42,287 --> 01:22:44,087
- He's right there. - Let the race...

2240
01:22:45,047 --> 01:22:46,157
start.

2241
01:22:46,687 --> 01:22:48,447
Goodness. What is this?

2242
01:22:48,687 --> 01:22:50,387
We just started.

2243
01:22:52,017 --> 01:22:54,047
What is it? Doesn't he have to do two?

2244
01:22:54,117 --> 01:22:55,717
Hey, Jong Kook. Why me? Wait.

2245
01:22:55,917 --> 01:22:57,617
No way. Seriously. Let me go.

2246
01:22:57,617 --> 01:22:58,917
- I am in a hurry. - You're making me sad.

2247
01:22:58,917 --> 01:23:00,047
I don't have time.

2248
01:23:00,047 --> 01:23:01,687
I will do exactly what you want.

2249
01:23:01,687 --> 01:23:03,547
(Haha fails to escape from this crisis.)

2250
01:23:05,187 --> 01:23:07,187
(Jong Kook throws Haha on to the ground.)

2251
01:23:08,487 --> 01:23:10,987
(He gives up.)

2252
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:14,587
I'm sorry, let me have the right foot shoe since I'm taking yours.

2253
01:23:14,587 --> 01:23:16,657
(I'm sorry, let me have the right foot shoe since I'm taking yours.)

2254
01:23:16,887 --> 01:23:19,087
(I can't believe you.)

2255
01:23:20,217 --> 01:23:23,047
(He runs at a full speed to kick the shoe again.)

2256
01:23:23,047 --> 01:23:24,347
I can't be eliminated.

2257
01:23:24,587 --> 01:23:27,017
No one can eliminate me. I have to hurry.

2258
01:23:29,047 --> 01:23:30,787
This is so embarrassing.

2259
01:23:30,987 --> 01:23:33,787
I am a man too. Hold on.

2260
01:23:34,817 --> 01:23:37,447
(Jong Kook tries for the second time.)

2261
01:23:38,547 --> 01:23:39,917
(Flying)

2262
01:23:41,587 --> 01:23:45,817
(What will Jong Kook's shoe decide for the second time?)

2263
01:23:48,871 --> 01:23:50,961
- Kim Jong Kook. - He picked himself!

2264
01:23:51,161 --> 01:23:53,961
(Jong Kook is eliminated.)

2265
01:23:53,961 --> 01:23:56,561
(This is how scary a decision of the shoe can be.)

2266
01:23:57,801 --> 01:23:59,431
(Good for you.)

2267
01:24:00,401 --> 01:24:01,431
He eliminated himself.

2268
01:24:01,431 --> 01:24:03,231
(Jong Kook ends the race with 90 dollars.)

2269
01:24:03,431 --> 01:24:05,131
Come here. You are eliminated too, right?

2270
01:24:05,261 --> 01:24:06,801
Yes, the thing is...

2271
01:24:06,801 --> 01:24:09,871
if I were eliminated by Jae Seok, it would have made me so angry.

2272
01:24:09,871 --> 01:24:11,431
Exactly. Your money would have been transferred.

2273
01:24:11,431 --> 01:24:13,801
I should've been eliminated after I got Haha.

2274
01:24:13,801 --> 01:24:15,431
Then I would have had a lot of money.

2275
01:24:15,431 --> 01:24:17,631
(But at least you got to do something.)

2276
01:24:17,631 --> 01:24:20,531
This is unbelievable. I came here without doing a thing.

2277
01:24:20,531 --> 01:24:21,901
How could it fall into your block?

2278
01:24:21,901 --> 01:24:23,531
That's my point. How is that possible?

2279
01:24:23,701 --> 01:24:25,871
(His legend as the race starter will continue.)

2280
01:24:26,871 --> 01:24:28,701
(Meanwhile)

2281
01:24:29,031 --> 01:24:30,261
(Ji Hyo is trying her best to find the hidden shoes.)

2282
01:24:30,261 --> 01:24:32,661
Shoes. Shoes! Where are they?

2283
01:24:33,261 --> 01:24:35,761
(And a woman is targeting Ji Hyo.)

2284
01:24:37,901 --> 01:24:39,161
(She is tailing Ji Hyo from afar.)

2285
01:24:40,761 --> 01:24:45,661
(From the start, So Min targeted Ji Hyo.)

2286
01:24:47,961 --> 01:24:50,001
Where is Ji Hyo?

2287
01:24:50,001 --> 01:24:51,431
Where would Ji Hyo be?

2288
01:24:52,331 --> 01:24:55,001
(After she spotted Ji Hyo,)

2289
01:24:55,001 --> 01:24:57,961
(she starts tailing Ji Hyo right away.)

2290
01:24:58,531 --> 01:24:59,801
Where are the shoes?

2291
01:25:00,301 --> 01:25:03,701
(This is my grand opportunity.)

2292
01:25:03,901 --> 01:25:06,701
(I will attack her when she's distracted.)

2293
01:25:06,701 --> 01:25:09,301
Why are you following me now?

2294
01:25:09,301 --> 01:25:10,601
No, I am not.

2295
01:25:10,601 --> 01:25:12,231
Why are you following me?

2296
01:25:12,231 --> 01:25:13,631
(You shouldn't get caught if you are tailing me!)

2297
01:25:13,631 --> 01:25:16,731
Ji Hyo, I am not after your shoes.

2298
01:25:19,561 --> 01:25:20,601
It's Se Chan.

2299
01:25:20,601 --> 01:25:22,231
(At this moment, Se Chan appears.)

2300
01:25:22,601 --> 01:25:23,901
What is it?

2301
01:25:23,901 --> 01:25:25,001
(He attacks So Min.)

2302
01:25:25,161 --> 01:25:27,661
This isn't how you play this. No!

2303
01:25:27,661 --> 01:25:29,501
(So Min tries to reciprocate.)

2304
01:25:29,501 --> 01:25:31,401
(She sits down thinking she won't win against him.)

2305
01:25:31,401 --> 01:25:33,371
You are so annoying. Let me have your shoes.

2306
01:25:35,761 --> 01:25:37,661
Hey, we shouldn't attack each other.

2307
01:25:37,661 --> 01:25:38,901
- We should... - What?

2308
01:25:39,261 --> 01:25:40,761
We joined the show on the same day.

2309
01:25:40,761 --> 01:25:43,371
Kwang Soo! I got So Min! Come here!

2310
01:25:46,161 --> 01:25:48,001
I will give you money.

2311
01:25:48,001 --> 01:25:50,861
- You are done. - No, that's not true. No!

2312
01:25:51,001 --> 01:25:52,901
- What is this? - Kwang Soo, I got her.

2313
01:25:52,901 --> 01:25:54,261
(Kwang Soo, save me!)

2314
01:25:54,901 --> 01:25:56,501
- Kwang Soo, let's not do this. - Kwang Soo, stop it.

2315
01:25:56,501 --> 01:25:57,501
Kwang Soo.

2316
01:25:58,301 --> 01:25:59,331
What a jerk!

2317
01:25:59,331 --> 01:26:01,701
(He's a jerk in disguise of a giraffe.)

2318
01:26:03,101 --> 01:26:05,561
- How can he... - I knew it. How can you trust him?

2319
01:26:06,401 --> 01:26:07,701
I am going to win it this time.

2320
01:26:07,701 --> 01:26:09,161
(Kwang Soo came to kick the shoe.)

2321
01:26:11,061 --> 01:26:13,401
(Right now, I might be dirt poor.)

2322
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:14,401
Challenge.

2323
01:26:14,401 --> 01:26:16,161
(With this shoe, I plan to flip my life.)

2324
01:26:17,601 --> 01:26:21,061
(What will Kwang Soo's shoe choose?)

2325
01:26:26,701 --> 01:26:29,431
(What? This is...)

2326
01:26:29,431 --> 01:26:33,131
(Will he win at his first try?)

2327
01:26:33,131 --> 01:26:34,861
(Will he be able to turn the race around?)

2328
01:26:35,261 --> 01:26:36,531
The race is over!

2329
01:26:36,531 --> 01:26:38,061
(The final race is over.)

2330
01:26:40,601 --> 01:26:42,101
Let me settle everyone's money.

2331
01:26:42,601 --> 01:26:44,161
(He's proud.)

2332
01:26:44,701 --> 01:26:47,301
So Min, you have 169 dollars.

2333
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:51,231
Jong Kook, since you eliminated yourself,

2334
01:26:51,231 --> 01:26:52,231
- you have 90 dollars. - Okay.

2335
01:26:52,231 --> 01:26:54,631
Ji Hyo, you have 40 dollars.

2336
01:26:55,001 --> 01:26:58,231
Haha, you were eliminated by Kwang Soo.

2337
01:26:58,231 --> 01:26:59,301
Sorry?

2338
01:27:00,701 --> 01:27:02,331
(Haha was eliminated...)

2339
01:27:02,331 --> 01:27:04,061
(by Kwang Soo?)

2340
01:27:05,401 --> 01:27:07,601
(A little while ago)

2341
01:27:09,001 --> 01:27:12,831
(The shoe that Kwang Soo kicked with all his might...)

2342
01:27:12,831 --> 01:27:16,161
(fell into...)

2343
01:27:16,161 --> 01:27:20,861
(the winning block at once.)

2344
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:22,361
Haha.

2345
01:27:22,361 --> 01:27:23,661
(And it flung back to Haha's block.)

2346
01:27:24,601 --> 01:27:25,601
Haha.

2347
01:27:25,601 --> 01:27:27,861
(Kwang Soo eliminated Haha and acquired half of Haha's money.)

2348
01:27:29,161 --> 01:27:30,501
- So... - How much do I have?

2349
01:27:30,501 --> 01:27:31,931
Haha, you have 85 dollars.

2350
01:27:31,931 --> 01:27:33,631
- Kwang Soo, you have the same. - Yes!

2351
01:27:33,661 --> 01:27:36,361
(From 0 dollar, he managed to earn 85 dollars.)

2352
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:38,701
- I was eliminated? - Yes, at the end.

2353
01:27:38,701 --> 01:27:41,431
(Then who won the race?)

2354
01:27:43,201 --> 01:27:45,431
(5 minutes before the race ended)

2355
01:27:45,431 --> 01:27:46,431
Here it is.

2356
01:27:46,661 --> 01:27:48,501
I found it. I found it!

2357
01:27:48,501 --> 01:27:50,061
(Jae Seok spotted a hidden shoe rather dramatically.)

2358
01:27:51,101 --> 01:27:52,701
(It was Jae Seok's first try kicking the shoe.)

2359
01:27:52,701 --> 01:27:54,801
Please. Please.

2360
01:27:57,201 --> 01:27:58,561
Did someone find the shoe?

2361
01:27:59,461 --> 01:28:01,331
If I land this shoe in the winning block, then I win, right?

2362
01:28:01,331 --> 01:28:03,161
(What will Jae Seok's shoe choose?)

2363
01:28:04,901 --> 01:28:06,801
(Flying)

2364
01:28:29,231 --> 01:28:31,031
(Victory)

2365
01:28:31,031 --> 01:28:32,161
That's crazy.

2366
01:28:33,401 --> 01:28:34,501
(Is this really happening?)

2367
01:28:34,501 --> 01:28:36,961
- Jae Seok, you won. - It felt into the winning block.

2368
01:28:36,961 --> 01:28:39,101
- Hey, I won! - How can you do this?

2369
01:28:39,101 --> 01:28:40,101
(No way.)

2370
01:28:40,601 --> 01:28:42,701
I am the winner!

2371
01:28:42,701 --> 01:28:45,231
(He manages to kick the shoe right inside the winning block.)

2372
01:28:45,231 --> 01:28:46,431
How could this have happened?

2373
01:28:46,431 --> 01:28:47,801
(Am I dreaming or is this real?)

2374
01:28:47,801 --> 01:28:49,831
- No way! - I won!

2375
01:28:50,261 --> 01:28:51,701
(She feels surreal even though she saw it with her own eyes.)

2376
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:53,101
- This is amazing. - No way.

2377
01:28:53,801 --> 01:28:55,201
Jae Seok, you won.

2378
01:28:55,801 --> 01:28:57,061
(Jae Seok wins the final race.)

2379
01:28:57,061 --> 01:28:58,861
What a lucky break!

2380
01:28:58,861 --> 01:29:00,031
(He acquires 100 dollars.)

2381
01:29:00,801 --> 01:29:03,061
Since you won, you received 100 dollars...

2382
01:29:03,061 --> 01:29:04,901
and you have a total of 200 dollars combining the money you had before.

2383
01:29:05,861 --> 01:29:07,601
That's amazing. He just turned rich.

2384
01:29:07,601 --> 01:29:09,201
I have to be in Jae Seok's graces.

2385
01:29:09,861 --> 01:29:14,101
(The 5th round of Dangerous Choices Part 2)

2386
01:29:14,661 --> 01:29:17,401
With my 80 dollars, I'd like to get rid of one Tour Sticker.

2387
01:29:17,401 --> 01:29:19,431
Why don't you listen to the whole script?

2388
01:29:19,431 --> 01:29:20,531
- All right. - Okay.

2389
01:29:21,031 --> 01:29:23,231
- What is happening? - We will open a Store of Fate now.

2390
01:29:23,231 --> 01:29:24,231
Excuse me?

2391
01:29:24,231 --> 01:29:27,131
(Store of Fate?)

2392
01:29:29,661 --> 01:29:33,031
You can buy 1 Tour Sticker for 50 dollars.

2393
01:29:33,031 --> 01:29:34,831
You are unbelievable.

2394
01:29:35,431 --> 01:29:38,131
For 100 dollars, you can buy 1 Reflecting Card.

2395
01:29:38,131 --> 01:29:40,161
- Reflecting Card? - This is driving me crazy.

2396
01:29:42,061 --> 01:29:45,401
(Jong Kook can't buy it since he needs 10 more dollars.)

2397
01:29:45,401 --> 01:29:46,961
I am doomed.

2398
01:29:47,101 --> 01:29:49,501
Haha has only 85 dollars and you have only 90 dollars, right?

2399
01:29:49,501 --> 01:29:50,861
That means both of you can't buy it then.

2400
01:29:51,231 --> 01:29:53,701
Kwang Soo, you have to decide. You must either buy a Tour Sticker...

2401
01:29:53,701 --> 01:29:56,461
or pay 80 dollars and get rid of your Tour Sticker.

2402
01:29:57,001 --> 01:29:58,331
Will it make a difference?

2403
01:29:58,331 --> 01:29:59,401
(He will end up going on the trip anyway.)

2404
01:30:00,301 --> 01:30:02,961
I think it might be better for you to hold on to the money.

2405
01:30:02,961 --> 01:30:04,201
- Keep the money. - Okay, let's go.

2406
01:30:04,201 --> 01:30:06,261
- You will end up going anyway. - Saving the money will do no good.

2407
01:30:06,261 --> 01:30:08,231
Take at least one person with you.

2408
01:30:08,861 --> 01:30:10,231
You should pay your debt first.

2409
01:30:10,701 --> 01:30:12,361
- That's the right thing to do. - You're right.

2410
01:30:12,401 --> 01:30:14,401
- You should pay your debt. - You're right.

2411
01:30:14,401 --> 01:30:15,861
I'll pay my debt.

2412
01:30:15,861 --> 01:30:16,901
You've made a choice.

2413
01:30:16,901 --> 01:30:18,161
As he's paying back 80 dollars,

2414
01:30:18,431 --> 01:30:21,561
we'll take one of his stickers away.

2415
01:30:21,561 --> 01:30:23,261
Okay. I have two now.

2416
01:30:23,601 --> 01:30:25,901
- Okay. - Please move to the store.

2417
01:30:25,901 --> 01:30:27,561
(They move to the Store of Fate.)

2418
01:30:29,661 --> 01:30:30,761
(Tour Sticker, Reflecting Card)

2419
01:30:30,761 --> 01:30:35,131
(People who chose the Tour Stickers.)

2420
01:30:35,461 --> 01:30:37,961
(So Min has 169 dollars.)

2421
01:30:38,031 --> 01:30:41,901
(People who consider getting the Reflecting Cards.)

2422
01:30:43,801 --> 01:30:46,461
(And...)

2423
01:30:46,461 --> 01:30:50,201
(all their choices can be reversed...)

2424
01:30:50,461 --> 01:30:53,261
(by this one person.)

2425
01:30:55,261 --> 01:30:58,401
(What will he choose?)

2426
01:31:00,661 --> 01:31:02,701
(It's a war from now on.)

2427
01:31:02,831 --> 01:31:05,631
(The brutal decisions are made in risk of the Dangerous Trip.)

2428
01:31:06,801 --> 01:31:09,001
(Twist after twist)

2429
01:31:09,001 --> 01:31:11,931
(Who will be sent on the Dangerous Trip?)

2430
01:31:12,501 --> 01:31:14,431
(And...)

2431
01:31:14,461 --> 01:31:17,561
(the Dangerous Tourist Attraction is decided.)

2432
01:31:18,401 --> 01:31:21,701
(Where Will Fate Lead Running Man?)
