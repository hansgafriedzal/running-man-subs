1
00:00:13,023 --> 00:00:14,723
(7 years ago,)

2
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,693
(the members' paths collided...)

3
00:00:17,693 --> 00:00:19,463
(for the show.)

4
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:23,663
(359 greetings...)

5
00:00:23,663 --> 00:00:26,803
(and countless laughter and memories)

6
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:32,873
(Running Man has run for 7 years.)

7
00:00:33,273 --> 00:00:37,443
(For 7 years, the 7 members completed various missions.)

8
00:00:39,043 --> 00:00:41,783
(For 7 years, the 7 members created legends.)

9
00:00:43,383 --> 00:00:46,383
(For 7 years, numerous friends joined them.)

10
00:00:47,253 --> 00:00:48,353
(Then the new family was born.)

11
00:00:49,153 --> 00:00:50,193
(Is he for real? The shameless man, Yang Se Chan)

12
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:51,963
(She has foolish charms. The magnet, Jeon So Min)

13
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:54,023
(Fear?)

14
00:00:54,023 --> 00:00:55,063
(Embarrassment?)

15
00:00:55,063 --> 00:00:57,133
(Difficulty?)

16
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:01,773
(Nothing scared them because they ran together.)

17
00:01:02,803 --> 00:01:06,503
(Now comes the special vacation to celebrate the 7th anniversary.)

18
00:01:07,143 --> 00:01:09,813
(J hanok hotel in Yeoncheon, Gyeonggi Province)

19
00:01:10,373 --> 00:01:14,453
(Hantan River and waterfall make Yeoncheon a nice vacation spot.)

20
00:01:15,353 --> 00:01:18,383
(This is a place for Running Man's 7th year anniversary vacation.)

21
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:24,223
(The gifts from South American fans decorate the place.)

22
00:01:24,223 --> 00:01:28,233
(Why is it raining?)

23
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:31,503
(Heavy rain watch has been issued. There will be 100mm of rain.)

24
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:36,873
(The heaviest rain falls on the day of the shoot.)

25
00:01:37,573 --> 00:01:39,873
(The production crew moves out from the original location.)

26
00:01:39,873 --> 00:01:43,073
- It's raining too hard. - Let's move.

27
00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:45,483
We are moving out.

28
00:01:45,483 --> 00:01:46,683
(The staff becomes busy.)

29
00:01:48,053 --> 00:01:49,613
- Hello. - Hello.

30
00:01:49,613 --> 00:01:51,183
- Hello. - Hello.

31
00:01:51,183 --> 00:01:52,253
Hello.

32
00:01:52,253 --> 00:01:53,683
- Hello. - Hello.

33
00:01:53,683 --> 00:01:54,793
- Hello. - What is this?

34
00:01:54,793 --> 00:01:56,053
It's rice.

35
00:01:56,523 --> 00:01:59,763
Latin American fans sent it to the lobby of SBS building.

36
00:01:59,763 --> 00:02:01,493
(Latin American fans sent rice for the 7th year anniversary.)

37
00:02:01,493 --> 00:02:02,663
From faraway countries,

38
00:02:03,393 --> 00:02:05,903
- our fans sent gifts. - We are very grateful.

39
00:02:05,903 --> 00:02:07,733
Thank you very much. We will work hard.

40
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:09,633
- Thank you. - Thank you.

41
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:13,043
- The 7th year anniversary. - The 7th year anniversary.

42
00:02:13,043 --> 00:02:14,513
I love the seventh year anniversary.

43
00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:16,273
- Seven years have passed. - Already.

44
00:02:16,273 --> 00:02:17,643
- Seven years have passed. - Time flew by so fast.

45
00:02:17,643 --> 00:02:19,513
- That's incredible. - This year,

46
00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:22,213
So Min and Se Chan have joined us,

47
00:02:22,213 --> 00:02:24,483
- and we're working hard together. - Right.

48
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:26,283
We'll keep on doing our best as well.

49
00:02:26,283 --> 00:02:28,923
- Great! - Let's do our best!

50
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:30,323
- Congratulations. - Goodness.

51
00:02:30,323 --> 00:02:31,823
You're our lucky charms.

52
00:02:32,793 --> 00:02:33,923
Goodness.

53
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:36,933
Jong Kook is unusually nice to Se Chan today.

54
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:40,403
Two days after the shooting last week,

55
00:02:40,603 --> 00:02:42,233
Se Chan asked me if I'm feeling better.

56
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:43,773
- I was worried. - Really?

57
00:02:43,773 --> 00:02:45,343
He texted me to check my condition.

58
00:02:45,473 --> 00:02:50,073
But Kwang Soo didn't send me a single text until today.

59
00:02:50,273 --> 00:02:52,343
- I... - He didn't even ask me how I was.

60
00:02:52,343 --> 00:02:54,283
I stayed up for three nights to pray for your health.

61
00:02:54,953 --> 00:02:56,213
I don't make it obvious like him.

62
00:02:56,953 --> 00:02:59,583
I get touched by small stuff like this.

63
00:02:59,953 --> 00:03:01,193
I was worried a lot.

64
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:02,593
- I'm fine now. - It's good to hear.

65
00:03:02,593 --> 00:03:04,723
- I got much better. - I always check your condition...

66
00:03:04,723 --> 00:03:06,963
by meeting your acquaintances. I worry if you eat well.

67
00:03:06,963 --> 00:03:08,233
He's lying.

68
00:03:08,293 --> 00:03:13,133
Do you know the meaning of the word written on your shirt?

69
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:15,203
It means to shut your mouth.

70
00:03:15,773 --> 00:03:17,133
- Stay silent. - Don't say anything.

71
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,403
"Don't say anything."

72
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:21,413
Congratulations, Kwang Soo.

73
00:03:21,473 --> 00:03:23,143
- By the way... - For what?

74
00:03:23,143 --> 00:03:25,813
(What is he talking about all of a sudden?)

75
00:03:26,143 --> 00:03:27,953
You have one more person to serve.

76
00:03:27,953 --> 00:03:29,153
What do you mean?

77
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:32,353
(He will have to serve Hye Kyo as well as his master, Joong Ki.)

78
00:03:32,353 --> 00:03:34,323
He'll have to serve her as well once they get married.

79
00:03:34,323 --> 00:03:36,393
If the two get married,

80
00:03:36,393 --> 00:03:38,793
are you going to move into their house?

81
00:03:38,863 --> 00:03:40,523
- What are you talking about? - As their butler.

82
00:03:40,523 --> 00:03:41,793
I have my own house.

83
00:03:42,063 --> 00:03:44,063
- You have to be always around them. - Look at him.

84
00:03:44,063 --> 00:03:45,663
You know there are maids who reside in their masters' house.

85
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:47,603
So that's not how it works.

86
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:48,733
There isn't such a system like that.

87
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:51,043
You should demand a salary now that you're serving two people.

88
00:03:51,043 --> 00:03:52,673
- What are you talking about? - You need to get paid.

89
00:03:52,703 --> 00:03:55,243
You'll be the first-class butler though.

90
00:03:55,243 --> 00:03:56,613
- Right. - Indeed.

91
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:58,543
By the way, is Jong Kook not going to wear his outfit today?

92
00:03:58,543 --> 00:03:59,643
What do you mean?

93
00:03:59,643 --> 00:04:01,283
- That's his outfit? - I'm all ready.

94
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:04,223
I can even see his ribs from here.

95
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:05,823
Because people all have their ribs.

96
00:04:05,823 --> 00:04:07,223
This one's better, I guess.

97
00:04:07,223 --> 00:04:10,393
He usually wears something that comes down to here.

98
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:12,863
That's only when I work out.

99
00:04:12,863 --> 00:04:14,963
- Gosh, seriously. - Those are my workout clothes.

100
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,933
I happen to put my hands inside that shirt whenever I wear it.

101
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:19,203
(It happens whenever I wear that shirt.)

102
00:04:19,203 --> 00:04:22,233
(He can reach his underwear directly.)

103
00:04:22,903 --> 00:04:25,673
Today, we've prepared a special race to do with your friends.

104
00:04:25,673 --> 00:04:27,573
- It's called Summer Race. - Okay.

105
00:04:27,913 --> 00:04:30,643
I'm sure you all invited one of your friends to join today's race.

106
00:04:30,643 --> 00:04:31,883
- Sure. - I did.

107
00:04:32,213 --> 00:04:34,553
Today's guests are on standby...

108
00:04:34,553 --> 00:04:35,913
in the room next to here.

109
00:04:35,913 --> 00:04:37,483
- Really? - I'm excited to meet them!

110
00:04:37,483 --> 00:04:42,553
(The invited friends are waiting next door.)

111
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:46,763
We'll move to the room and start our race.

112
00:04:46,763 --> 00:04:48,693
(Let's go meet their friends who are here to join the race.)

113
00:04:48,693 --> 00:04:50,093
Let's go!

114
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:56,673
(The rain pours down as if it's celebrating the 7th anniversary.)

115
00:04:57,373 --> 00:04:58,843
(Running Man members' friends are waiting inside.)

116
00:04:58,843 --> 00:04:59,943
There are a lot of them.

117
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:01,873
There are many of them.

118
00:05:02,513 --> 00:05:05,943
Your friends are waiting behind these blinds.

119
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:08,513
(Come meet us.)

120
00:05:08,513 --> 00:05:11,383
We'll get right into your first mission...

121
00:05:11,383 --> 00:05:13,183
to acquire 10 dollars which will play a big role in today's race.

122
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:15,893
(Succeed the mission for 10 dollars.)

123
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:18,393
- It's about mission money. - 10 dollars is a lot.

124
00:05:18,393 --> 00:05:20,063
10 dollars in Running Man is worth 1,000 dollars.

125
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:22,863
(They start guessing their guests.)

126
00:05:22,863 --> 00:05:25,363
Let's start the first mission in finding your guests.

127
00:05:25,963 --> 00:05:28,933
We don't know whom each of us invited, right?

128
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:30,073
- No. - I have no idea.

129
00:05:30,073 --> 00:05:32,303
- Except for my guest. - But So Min...

130
00:05:32,803 --> 00:05:34,713
is wearing a t-shirt that says "older sister" on it.

131
00:05:34,713 --> 00:05:37,043
(Your older sister is here.)

132
00:05:37,043 --> 00:05:39,043
I guess it's someone younger than her.

133
00:05:39,243 --> 00:05:42,213
- I think the same way. - I think so too.

134
00:05:42,713 --> 00:05:44,123
It could be...

135
00:05:44,453 --> 00:05:45,723
your family member for real...

136
00:05:45,723 --> 00:05:47,823
or someone who's like your family.

137
00:05:47,823 --> 00:05:50,153
- Family. - It could be someone really close.

138
00:05:50,153 --> 00:05:51,693
- Like we're so close to each other. - Yes, we're like family.

139
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:53,123
- He and I are like family. - Se Chan and I.

140
00:05:53,123 --> 00:05:54,333
- Family. - What about Kwang Soo?

141
00:05:54,793 --> 00:05:56,733
(Three of us are like family.)

142
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:58,263
- Not him anymore. - Not him?

143
00:05:58,263 --> 00:05:59,303
Not anymore.

144
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:01,033
(He attacks Jong Kook's weak spot.)

145
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:03,003
- Why would you do that? - Goodness.

146
00:06:03,003 --> 00:06:04,203
For goodness' sake.

147
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:08,173
We're not sure whom each of us invited,

148
00:06:08,173 --> 00:06:11,083
but we'll say hello to them first.

149
00:06:11,143 --> 00:06:13,643
We'll start from number one.

150
00:06:13,643 --> 00:06:16,783
- Hello. - Hello.

151
00:06:17,013 --> 00:06:18,553
- It's a guy. - It's a guy.

152
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:20,153
His fake voice sounds like a man.

153
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:22,893
You can't tell who invited you, can you?

154
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:24,323
No.

155
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:25,663
- That was short. - He sounds...

156
00:06:25,663 --> 00:06:26,893
Did you wait long?

157
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:28,193
- Yes. - What was that?

158
00:06:28,593 --> 00:06:32,003
Are you annoyed because you had to wait so long?

159
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,603
A little.

160
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:36,003
You're annoyed a little?

161
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:37,403
He's talking so casually to us.

162
00:06:38,073 --> 00:06:41,513
I think he's quite close with us.

163
00:06:41,743 --> 00:06:44,143
I think it's Seok Jin's friend.

164
00:06:44,143 --> 00:06:46,783
- Isn't he one of your club members? - Is he?

165
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,983
(What's the identity of number 1?)

166
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:52,583
Let's try talking to number four now. Hello.

167
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:53,923
Hello.

168
00:06:53,923 --> 00:06:55,253
(Nervous)

169
00:06:55,553 --> 00:06:56,953
I can sense right away...

170
00:06:56,953 --> 00:06:58,223
that it's your first time on television.

171
00:06:59,093 --> 00:07:01,663
Not at all.

172
00:07:01,663 --> 00:07:02,993
- Is it a woman? - Is it a woman?

173
00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:04,263
Is it a man or a woman?

174
00:07:04,263 --> 00:07:05,503
What's your job, a singer?

175
00:07:05,503 --> 00:07:07,833
Have you joined Running Man before?

176
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:09,173
- No. - It's your first time?

177
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:10,233
- It's your first time? - Yes.

178
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:11,473
Did you appear on any other programs?

179
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:13,603
Yes.

180
00:07:13,773 --> 00:07:15,143
Why do you keep laughing?

181
00:07:15,473 --> 00:07:17,683
(Laughing)

182
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:19,583
- What's wrong with you? - Have you lost your mind?

183
00:07:19,883 --> 00:07:21,613
- She's scary. - What's wrong with you?

184
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,683
Is it a man or a woman?

185
00:07:23,683 --> 00:07:25,183
That person sounds like a professional.

186
00:07:26,023 --> 00:07:28,493
Let's try talking to number six this time. Hello.

187
00:07:28,553 --> 00:07:30,793
Hello.

188
00:07:30,793 --> 00:07:32,423
- What? - It's a girl!

189
00:07:32,423 --> 00:07:33,793
She has a very thin voice.

190
00:07:34,263 --> 00:07:35,333
That sounded cute.

191
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:38,333
Her voice sounds pretty.

192
00:07:39,163 --> 00:07:42,633
It's either a girl or Jong Kook to have that kind of voice.

193
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:43,673
- Hey. - I mean...

194
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:45,573
- Since it's not you, it's a girl. - What are you talking about?

195
00:07:46,073 --> 00:07:47,103
Because it's not you.

196
00:07:48,173 --> 00:07:50,413
Next up is number seven. Hello.

197
00:07:50,913 --> 00:07:52,413
Hello.

198
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:54,013
Number seven.

199
00:07:54,213 --> 00:07:56,513
You don't sound like...

200
00:07:56,513 --> 00:07:59,353
you're used to being on television. Am I right?

201
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,683
Have you been on many TV programs?

202
00:08:01,423 --> 00:08:03,753
It's my first time.

203
00:08:03,753 --> 00:08:05,323
- It's her first time. - It's her first time.

204
00:08:05,323 --> 00:08:06,493
It's your first time on television?

205
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:08,433
- She's never been on TV before. - Then she must be a family member.

206
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:11,063
- She's a family member. - It's possible.

207
00:08:11,063 --> 00:08:13,103
- By the way, So Min. - Yes?

208
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:16,703
Why do you look so nervous? Whom did you invite?

209
00:08:16,703 --> 00:08:18,543
- She's acting strange. - Why are you sweating so much?

210
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:20,273
- She's so quiet too. - Is she a spy?

211
00:08:20,643 --> 00:08:21,843
- What's wrong with you? - You tend to be...

212
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:23,773
nervous when your family comes out as a guest.

213
00:08:23,773 --> 00:08:24,943
He's right.

214
00:08:25,783 --> 00:08:29,853
By the way, why are you pressing down on their shoulders?

215
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:31,053
(They've become his armrest.)

216
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,653
- I think... - What's this?

217
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:34,193
I think I'll get a heat rash here, but I'm letting him be.

218
00:08:34,193 --> 00:08:36,053
I'm enduring the pain in my back too.

219
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:37,763
I think I'm getting a heat rash.

220
00:08:37,993 --> 00:08:39,563
- Can't you put your arms down? - If I put them down,

221
00:08:39,563 --> 00:08:42,893
we'll feel more uncomfortable since there isn't much room here.

222
00:08:42,893 --> 00:08:45,033
You're the only one who's feeling comfortable now though.

223
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:47,673
- We like it this way. - Right?

224
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,673
(They're done greeting their guests. It's time to guess who they are.)

225
00:08:50,673 --> 00:08:52,103
We've said hi to them briefly.

226
00:08:52,103 --> 00:08:54,443
We'll now talk more in detail with them.

227
00:08:54,443 --> 00:08:57,413
Please answer yes or no to our questions.

228
00:08:57,513 --> 00:08:58,783
Here's the first question.

229
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:02,153
"I have one thing which I'd like my friend not to do."

230
00:09:02,283 --> 00:09:04,923
Please answer yes or no.

231
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,953
1, 2, 3.

232
00:09:06,953 --> 00:09:08,553
(What will be their answers?)

233
00:09:08,553 --> 00:09:10,023
- They all have it. - They all answered yes.

234
00:09:10,793 --> 00:09:12,263
- Except number 1. - Number 1 answered no.

235
00:09:12,263 --> 00:09:14,233
- I guess their friends are perfect. - 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 answered yes.

236
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:15,593
(They all answered yes except for number 1 and 6.)

237
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:17,263
Number four.

238
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:19,033
What would you like for your friend not to do?

239
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:21,133
I like everything about my friend...

240
00:09:21,403 --> 00:09:24,003
except for the drinking habits.

241
00:09:24,003 --> 00:09:25,073
- Drinking habits? - Drinking habits?

242
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:26,203
(Drinking habits)

243
00:09:26,673 --> 00:09:28,943
(How are number four's friend's drinking habits?)

244
00:09:29,143 --> 00:09:30,213
- Drinking habits? - Drinking habits?

245
00:09:30,513 --> 00:09:32,483
- It must be Kwang Soo. - Can you explain more in detail?

246
00:09:32,683 --> 00:09:35,853
My friend won't let me go home or sleep.

247
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:38,823
My friend won't let me go home or sleep.

248
00:09:38,823 --> 00:09:40,223
- It's Ji Hyo. - By any chance...

249
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:42,293
Can you tell us an example?

250
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,823
My friend splashes water.

251
00:09:45,993 --> 00:09:47,663
- Splashes water? - What?

252
00:09:47,693 --> 00:09:49,263
I do it once in a while.

253
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:50,903
It might be Kwang Soo's friend.

254
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:52,233
What about you, Ji Hyo?

255
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:54,273
I do that sometimes.

256
00:09:54,603 --> 00:09:57,233
She splashes water on cigarettes when they don't get put out.

257
00:09:57,403 --> 00:09:58,743
Only when they don't get put out.

258
00:09:58,943 --> 00:10:00,103
Splashing water is much easier, you know.

259
00:10:02,573 --> 00:10:04,183
She used to do it with her saliva before,

260
00:10:04,543 --> 00:10:07,213
- but not these days. - Because we can't smoke indoors.

261
00:10:07,383 --> 00:10:08,853
- We have to smoke outdoors. - So she uses water.

262
00:10:08,853 --> 00:10:10,053
(Those slanderers.)

263
00:10:10,053 --> 00:10:11,753
How far can your friend go?

264
00:10:11,753 --> 00:10:13,383
Does that person catch you when you try to sneak out?

265
00:10:13,623 --> 00:10:15,653
Right, when I try to leave,

266
00:10:15,653 --> 00:10:17,123
that person acts pathetic all of a sudden.

267
00:10:17,123 --> 00:10:18,363
- Pathetic? - Goodness.

268
00:10:18,363 --> 00:10:19,463
- It's not me then. - It's Kwang Soo.

269
00:10:19,463 --> 00:10:20,523
- It's Kwang Soo. - No?

270
00:10:20,523 --> 00:10:21,593
- It's Kwang Soo. - It's Kwang Soo.

271
00:10:21,593 --> 00:10:22,963
- It's Kwang Soo. - She rather follows the other.

272
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:26,203
Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, and I had a drink the other day.

273
00:10:26,363 --> 00:10:29,173
Jong Kook and I pretended to go home and went alone to talk in private.

274
00:10:29,303 --> 00:10:32,303
But she kept following us in secret by her manager's car.

275
00:10:33,073 --> 00:10:34,343
We tried to send her home,

276
00:10:34,773 --> 00:10:36,243
but she followed us in secret.

277
00:10:36,613 --> 00:10:39,013
They kept going somewhere else without me.

278
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,953
We almost thought there was a tracker installed in our car.

279
00:10:40,953 --> 00:10:42,983
There was no way she could run into us.

280
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:44,923
(You can't escape from her until morning once you drink with her.)

281
00:10:44,923 --> 00:10:45,983
That startled us.

282
00:10:46,223 --> 00:10:48,723
- It must be Kwang Soo. - It must be Ji Hyo.

283
00:10:49,223 --> 00:10:51,493
- Number five. - Yes?

284
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:52,963
What do you want your friend to not do?

285
00:10:53,123 --> 00:10:55,093
Personality is one thing,

286
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:59,233
but I think the biggest thing is the drinking.

287
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:00,803
- Drinking? - Alcohol again?

288
00:11:00,803 --> 00:11:02,133
The person must drink a lot.

289
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,373
Does your friend drink too much?

290
00:11:03,503 --> 00:11:05,043
It's beyond your imagination.

291
00:11:05,043 --> 00:11:06,303
How does your friend act when drunk?

292
00:11:07,343 --> 00:11:09,373
My friend becomes a complete mess.

293
00:11:11,613 --> 00:11:13,143
- A complete mess? - Yes.

294
00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:15,813
Whenever I try to go home,

295
00:11:15,813 --> 00:11:18,683
my friend uses violence and splashes water.

296
00:11:18,683 --> 00:11:22,423
Sometimes, my friend hits me and kicks my bottom too.

297
00:11:22,423 --> 00:11:24,123
- It's Ji Hyo! - They like to tease people.

298
00:11:24,123 --> 00:11:25,393
It's you for certain.

299
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,093
- It's Ji Hyo. - This is...

300
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:29,593
- Right, splashing water. - I have to dance...

301
00:11:29,593 --> 00:11:34,133
to the same song for two hours. Only then, my friend falls asleep.

302
00:11:34,673 --> 00:11:36,833
- Hold on. - So Min looks serious.

303
00:11:36,973 --> 00:11:38,003
So Min.

304
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:40,643
Why are you being so quiet and careful all of a sudden?

305
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:42,443
- What's wrong with you? - Apologize already.

306
00:11:42,443 --> 00:11:43,573
I don't dance.

307
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:45,883
- I don't dance. - It's not So Min.

308
00:11:45,883 --> 00:11:47,343
Have you danced for two hours before?

309
00:11:48,213 --> 00:11:49,983
- I do that every time. - Every time?

310
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:51,553
- It's her. - I didn't know she danced.

311
00:11:51,553 --> 00:11:52,653
- Do you dance? - I love to dance.

312
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:54,253
It's just that I'm not good at it.

313
00:11:54,253 --> 00:11:56,153
- I love to dance. - Is that so?

314
00:11:56,153 --> 00:11:57,423
Is it you?

315
00:11:57,423 --> 00:12:01,193
(It's Ji Hyo's younger brother, Chun Sung Moon.)

316
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:06,933
(They were both good-looking since they were young.)

317
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:11,643
(He kicked Ji Hyo on behalf of all the younger brothers in Korea.)

318
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:15,343
(He's now an actor following his sister's footsteps.)

319
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:18,313
Number six, why did you answer no to the question?

320
00:12:18,813 --> 00:12:20,543
So far,

321
00:12:21,683 --> 00:12:23,013
this person has nothing to work on.

322
00:12:23,013 --> 00:12:24,823
- So far, there's nothing. - So far?

323
00:12:24,823 --> 00:12:26,183
- I see. - What if they are not close?

324
00:12:26,183 --> 00:12:27,753
Could it be that you're not interested in this person?

325
00:12:27,753 --> 00:12:31,063
I don't even know their phone number.

326
00:12:33,393 --> 00:12:35,363
- You don't have the number? - You don't have it?

327
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:37,463
Why did you decide to star on our show today?

328
00:12:37,463 --> 00:12:38,603
- Why are you here? - Hold on.

329
00:12:38,603 --> 00:12:40,603
I don't know.

330
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:42,373
- You don't know? - By any chance,

331
00:12:42,373 --> 00:12:44,443
did you regret coming here today even for a second?

332
00:12:45,003 --> 00:12:49,273
Well, yes. Right now, I feel...

333
00:12:49,273 --> 00:12:50,543
You're regretting it now?

334
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:52,283
- Now? - She's regretting it now.

335
00:12:52,283 --> 00:12:55,153
- She said she regrets it now. - Among other things...

336
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:56,953
(Number 6 who keeps the members on their toes, is...)

337
00:12:56,953 --> 00:13:01,653
(Son Na Eun, Se Chan's pick, whom he wants as his family member.)

338
00:13:02,093 --> 00:13:05,893
(She didn't do anything, but managed to steal Se Chan's heart.)

339
00:13:06,093 --> 00:13:10,163
(The crew invited her since Se Chan wanted to talk to her more.)

340
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,633
So do you wish to know this person's number?

341
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:18,543
(If we meet only once, it's a coincidence,)

342
00:13:18,543 --> 00:13:21,613
(but if we meet twice, it's fate.)

343
00:13:22,443 --> 00:13:25,813
Well... Sure.

344
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:28,213
(Everyone can see it's a definite rejection.)

345
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:30,613
- Hey, you! Go home! - I bet it's her.

346
00:13:30,923 --> 00:13:32,183
Get out of here!

347
00:13:32,483 --> 00:13:34,323
Before you hurt my feelings even more, leave!

348
00:13:34,553 --> 00:13:36,253
Go before you hurt me more.

349
00:13:36,253 --> 00:13:38,163
(I've experienced this many times before.)

350
00:13:38,363 --> 00:13:40,763
- I won't ask for you anymore. - Could it really be her?

351
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:42,163
- This is really happening. - No way.

352
00:13:42,163 --> 00:13:44,063
- Se Chan. - Could it really be Na Eun?

353
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,463
- It can't be her. - Is it really her?

354
00:13:46,463 --> 00:13:48,933
(What is the ending of his one-sided romance?)

355
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:50,633
What about you, Number Three?

356
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:52,803
You answered yes to the question.

357
00:13:52,803 --> 00:13:56,173
I want this person to talk less.

358
00:13:56,173 --> 00:13:58,083
- He wants this person to talk less. - It's you, Jae Seok.

359
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,513
- Did you invite two people? - Is it So Min?

360
00:13:59,513 --> 00:14:00,883
(Is it Jae Seok, the talkative one?)

361
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,283
Is it So Min? Could it be her?

362
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:04,353
- That's right. It's So Min. - She talks a lot too.

363
00:14:04,353 --> 00:14:05,783
- He was referring to her. - It's So Min.

364
00:14:05,783 --> 00:14:07,723
He wants her to talk less.

365
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:09,023
- So Min... - I bet she talks a lot at home too.

366
00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:10,923
She is truly talkative.

367
00:14:11,663 --> 00:14:13,223
(Is Number 3 my brother?)

368
00:14:13,223 --> 00:14:15,863
Does this member tell you to work on something?

369
00:14:15,863 --> 00:14:16,993
Definitely.

370
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:18,533
- Please give us an example. - Is he talking about me?

371
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:20,233
This person tells me to work out.

372
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:22,133
(They nag him to work out the most.)

373
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:23,333
This person tells me to work out.

374
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,473
- He's talking about Jong Kook! - True.

375
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,103
(If he's into fitness, it's Jong Kook.)

376
00:14:27,103 --> 00:14:29,073
- It has to be him. - He's talking about me.

377
00:14:29,073 --> 00:14:31,083
- Jong Myung! - Hey, Jong Myung.

378
00:14:31,513 --> 00:14:33,013
Aren't you Kim Jong Myung?

379
00:14:33,243 --> 00:14:35,283
You came here today, and didn't go to your clinic, did you?

380
00:14:35,783 --> 00:14:37,083
Jong Myung, it's you, isn't it?

381
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:40,483
(He's a legendary figure who scolded Jong Kook and bossed him around.)

382
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,623
(Left: Jong Kook, Right: Jong Myung)

383
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:46,993
(Jong Myung is Jong Kook's proud brother who is a plastic surgeon.)

384
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,563
- Okay. I got it. - It's his brother.

385
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:52,403
- Life is important, not money. - It has to be his brother.

386
00:14:53,303 --> 00:14:54,703
You ought to work out.

387
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,003
Okay. Number Eight, you're up.

388
00:14:57,743 --> 00:14:59,243
What do you want your friend to work on?

389
00:14:59,243 --> 00:15:01,213
This friend of mine...

390
00:15:01,213 --> 00:15:03,413
isn't like this anymore,

391
00:15:03,413 --> 00:15:07,483
but my friend used to fall in love too easily.

392
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:09,153
- He's a hopeless romantic. - It has to be Kwang Soo then.

393
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:10,553
- It's definitely Kwang Soo. - It's him.

394
00:15:10,553 --> 00:15:11,683
- Then... - It ought to be him.

395
00:15:11,683 --> 00:15:13,783
- But he still falls in love easily. - It's Kwang Soo's friend.

396
00:15:13,783 --> 00:15:16,493
- He does fall in love quickly. - But the thing is,

397
00:15:16,493 --> 00:15:18,763
- he doesn't do that anymore. - Your friend doesn't now?

398
00:15:18,763 --> 00:15:20,093
He's not like that now.

399
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:21,593
Then it's not you.

400
00:15:21,763 --> 00:15:23,263
To be frank, I still fall in love quickly.

401
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:27,603
Can you give us an example when you thought he fell in love too quickly?

402
00:15:27,903 --> 00:15:30,803
One time, I saw him fall in love with someone from the audience.

403
00:15:30,803 --> 00:15:33,503
(He once fell in love with an audience member.)

404
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:34,713
- Someone from the audience? - What?

405
00:15:35,073 --> 00:15:37,013
- Can this air? - Hey!

406
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:38,413
Can you talk about this on TV?

407
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:39,583
Is he talking about you?

408
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,483
- Was that you? - Well...

409
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,783
- Did you really fall in love? - I'm sure it's Seok Jin...

410
00:15:44,223 --> 00:15:45,723
- because... - Next week...

411
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,923
(The identity of Number 8 who threw off Seok Jin is...)

412
00:15:48,923 --> 00:15:51,393
(Kim Soo Yong, a member of Big Mouth and a friend of 30 years.)

413
00:15:51,523 --> 00:15:54,093
I wasn't flirting with someone from the audience.

414
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:55,733
- Don't get the wrong idea. - Why?

415
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:58,203
- Did he mean you? - She happened to be there.

416
00:15:58,203 --> 00:15:59,533
That wasn't her job.

417
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:01,203
- You weren't trying to seduce her. - No way.

418
00:16:01,203 --> 00:16:02,903
- Don't use that expression. - That wasn't it.

419
00:16:02,903 --> 00:16:04,403
- But it's true. - Why do you say I picked her up?

420
00:16:04,403 --> 00:16:06,273
- At that time, it was serious. - But you did pick her up.

421
00:16:06,273 --> 00:16:08,513
- It was a serious relationship. - It's all in the past.

422
00:16:08,643 --> 00:16:10,243
Hey, go easy on me.

423
00:16:10,883 --> 00:16:12,013
Okay.

424
00:16:12,913 --> 00:16:14,583
Here's the next question.

425
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:15,713
This will tell us everything.

426
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:19,353
Have you ever heard of your family member badmouthing...

427
00:16:19,483 --> 00:16:21,293
members of Running Man?

428
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:24,793
(Have they ever talked badly about one of their members?)

429
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:29,593
- This is a sensitive one. - Goodness, this question...

430
00:16:29,593 --> 00:16:30,863
If this gets out, it will be a mess.

431
00:16:30,863 --> 00:16:31,903
Hey, but this...

432
00:16:33,203 --> 00:16:35,673
Don't talk. Don't talk, okay?

433
00:16:35,673 --> 00:16:36,903
Don't tell them.

434
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:39,843
Everyone, you must clearly raise your answer boards.

435
00:16:39,843 --> 00:16:41,843
A lot of you can't laugh at ease.

436
00:16:41,843 --> 00:16:42,873
I see.

437
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:45,283
(He smiles awkwardly.)

438
00:16:45,283 --> 00:16:47,553
In 1, 2, 3.

439
00:16:47,913 --> 00:16:49,753
- O, O, O. - Many of them answered no.

440
00:16:49,753 --> 00:16:50,823
(Only numbers 1, 7, and 8 answer yes.)

441
00:16:50,823 --> 00:16:52,153
Number One said she did hear the member badmouth.

442
00:16:52,283 --> 00:16:55,323
Number One, please tell us briefly what this person talked about.

443
00:16:55,423 --> 00:16:57,963
This person badmouths quite often.

444
00:16:57,963 --> 00:16:59,023
- Quite often? - Quite often?

445
00:16:59,023 --> 00:17:01,233
(Can I tell them?)

446
00:17:01,963 --> 00:17:03,633
- That person badmouthed often. - Really?

447
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:05,403
- Whom does he badmouth the most? - Who is it?

448
00:17:05,403 --> 00:17:07,873
- Whom does he talk about the most? - Whom does he badmouth the most?

449
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:10,133
- I just got goose bumps. - Who is it?

450
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:12,243
Can you give us an example?

451
00:17:13,143 --> 00:17:15,513
He said that he's going to beat up Jong Kook one day.

452
00:17:15,513 --> 00:17:17,783
(The mysterious member plans to get back at Jong Kook one day.)

453
00:17:17,783 --> 00:17:19,783
- It's Haha. - I never said that.

454
00:17:19,783 --> 00:17:21,683
- It's either you or him. - No, it's not me.

455
00:17:21,683 --> 00:17:23,353
- I didn't say that. - It's one of them.

456
00:17:23,353 --> 00:17:24,923
- I swear I've never said that. - It has to be you.

457
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:27,053
- It's one of you. - Then my friend must be lying.

458
00:17:27,053 --> 00:17:28,823
- Jong Kook. - Why would I say such a thing?

459
00:17:28,823 --> 00:17:30,763
- It's possible. - He's friends with one of you.

460
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:33,023
- It's either Haha or Kwang Soo. - Why do you think it could be me?

461
00:17:33,023 --> 00:17:35,133
- You hurt my feelings. - Nothing's confirmed yet.

462
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:36,763
So what did your friend say?

463
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:39,763
He asked for my help.

464
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:41,703
It has to be Haha.

465
00:17:41,703 --> 00:17:44,443
(He asked for my help to beat up Jong Kook.)

466
00:17:44,443 --> 00:17:46,203
- It has to be Haha. - Haha.

467
00:17:46,703 --> 00:17:48,243
It's him. It's him.

468
00:17:48,243 --> 00:17:50,713
- He asked for help? - No, it's Kwang Soo.

469
00:17:50,713 --> 00:17:52,783
- He wanted to outnumber you. - It's Kwang Soo.

470
00:17:53,313 --> 00:17:54,813
I have never imagined attacking you.

471
00:17:54,813 --> 00:17:57,453
- He said he'd win if it's 2 to 1. - 2 to 1?

472
00:17:57,653 --> 00:17:59,453
- I have a feeling it's Kwang Soo. - I wouldn't dare to think of it.

473
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,823
Hey, you told me that yourself.

474
00:18:00,823 --> 00:18:03,353
- He told me this when he got drunk. - Calm down.

475
00:18:03,353 --> 00:18:05,923
- He said he wanted to join forces. - Give us another example.

476
00:18:06,123 --> 00:18:07,633
It's about Kwang Soo.

477
00:18:07,663 --> 00:18:09,093
(Another example concerns Kwang Soo.)

478
00:18:09,493 --> 00:18:11,133
- It's about Kwang Soo. - It's about Kwang Soo?

479
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:12,333
- What did he say? - What is it?

480
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,503
Then it must be Haha.

481
00:18:13,503 --> 00:18:18,103
He said that Kwang Soo wants to copy...

482
00:18:18,103 --> 00:18:19,643
every fashion sense he has.

483
00:18:19,643 --> 00:18:20,643
What?

484
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:22,843
(What do you mean I want to copy you?)

485
00:18:23,443 --> 00:18:26,213
- What? What do you mean? - I'm right, and you know it.

486
00:18:26,213 --> 00:18:28,453
- Whenever I buy something, - That was...

487
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,953
- you wear it the next day. - Wait, you...

488
00:18:30,953 --> 00:18:32,523
- talked about it behind my back? - Hold on a second.

489
00:18:32,923 --> 00:18:35,993
- It's certain now. - I think he is my friend.

490
00:18:37,193 --> 00:18:39,463
(Number 1 might have attacked Jong Kook 2 to 1.)

491
00:18:39,463 --> 00:18:41,563
(He is Park Geun Sik, Haha's friend of 20 years.)

492
00:18:41,563 --> 00:18:43,193
I like this guy.

493
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:47,263
(Haha's best friend whose friendship began from school days until now)

494
00:18:47,263 --> 00:18:50,473
(Geun Sik is a loyal friend, and wants to do everything with Haha.)

495
00:18:50,803 --> 00:18:53,643
Number Two, you answered no.

496
00:18:53,643 --> 00:18:54,773
Your friend didn't badmouth anyone?

497
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:59,183
He's not the type who badmouths other people behind their backs.

498
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:03,213
He tends to badmouth them directly.

499
00:19:04,183 --> 00:19:06,453
(He talks badly in front of the person.)

500
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:08,123
He's talking about Jae Seok. It's him!

501
00:19:08,123 --> 00:19:09,823
- It's you. - I'm 100 percent certain.

502
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:11,293
(He's known for badmouthing someone so openly.)

503
00:19:11,323 --> 00:19:13,823
- That's right. I do that. - You're right.

504
00:19:13,823 --> 00:19:14,963
- You do. - Right.

505
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:16,493
Was there a time he talked about you when you were present?

506
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:18,563
There were countless times.

507
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:22,173
- What did he say to you? - What did he say recently?

508
00:19:22,303 --> 00:19:25,203
Recently, what I heard the most from him was that...

509
00:19:25,303 --> 00:19:28,143
I'm arrogant.

510
00:19:28,143 --> 00:19:29,473
- You're arrogant? - I see.

511
00:19:29,773 --> 00:19:32,213
I told him I was at home when he asked,

512
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,853
and he told me that I was arrogant.

513
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,623
What is so arrogant about being at home? Why is he arrogant?

514
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,983
- Why is that? - Wait.

515
00:19:39,983 --> 00:19:43,593
He told me that I have to go out and socialize at times like this.

516
00:19:43,593 --> 00:19:45,263
One time, when I was out,

517
00:19:45,423 --> 00:19:46,993
I got a phone call.

518
00:19:46,993 --> 00:19:48,533
When he asked where I was, I told him I was out.

519
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:50,193
He told me again that I was arrogant.

520
00:19:50,763 --> 00:19:52,303
Where is this guest supposed to stay then?

521
00:19:53,063 --> 00:19:54,233
(Just hearing this annoys them.)

522
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:55,603
Where should he be then?

523
00:19:55,603 --> 00:19:58,843
He told me to go home and work on myself.

524
00:19:59,903 --> 00:20:01,273
I think I know who this is.

525
00:20:01,313 --> 00:20:02,873
- Number Two. - Yes?

526
00:20:02,873 --> 00:20:06,143
So you've never talked about him behind his back?

527
00:20:06,283 --> 00:20:08,113
I have.

528
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:12,823
What did you say about him?

529
00:20:13,123 --> 00:20:15,193
I said that he made me feel horrible.

530
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:18,363
You felt horrible when he nagged you?

531
00:20:18,363 --> 00:20:19,393
(It's Cho Sae Ho.)

532
00:20:19,393 --> 00:20:20,833
All right.

533
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:23,363
- Next up is Number Four. - Yes.

534
00:20:23,863 --> 00:20:26,133
You answered no. This person never badmouthed members of the show?

535
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:29,233
It's actually the contrary. I heard this person complimenting...

536
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:31,273
members of Running Man.

537
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,343
- This person complimented us? - Please give us an example.

538
00:20:33,543 --> 00:20:37,173
I heard this person say that you are loyal, kind, and diligent.

539
00:20:37,173 --> 00:20:38,813
- We are diligent? - That person is nice.

540
00:20:38,813 --> 00:20:40,113
- Diligent? - It must be a family member.

541
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:43,113
- I don't know who that is, but... - This person didn't badmouth us,

542
00:20:43,113 --> 00:20:45,183
but considering the frequencies of the compliments,

543
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,593
which member received the least number of compliments?

544
00:20:47,823 --> 00:20:49,253
(Chuckling)

545
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:50,723
- The guest is laughing. - Exactly.

546
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:54,333
It's Ji Hyo.

547
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,063
Who is it?

548
00:20:57,363 --> 00:20:59,263
- Who is it? - Who can that be?

549
00:21:00,703 --> 00:21:02,033
(You don't have to be so honest.)

550
00:21:02,033 --> 00:21:03,333
- Who is it? - Sit down.

551
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:04,643
Kwang Soo.

552
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,173
- It must be Kwang Soo. - It's Kwang Soo!

553
00:21:09,173 --> 00:21:13,043
- He doesn't badmouth us. - What's happening?

554
00:21:13,113 --> 00:21:14,783
I only compliment. I don't talk behind their backs.

555
00:21:14,783 --> 00:21:16,013
- So... - What just happened?

556
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:17,953
He just doesn't compliment her. That's all.

557
00:21:17,953 --> 00:21:20,823
(Tae Hang Ho, Kwang Soo's actor friend, shares opinions bluntly.)

558
00:21:21,153 --> 00:21:23,353
(He demonstrated a unique performance...)

559
00:21:23,353 --> 00:21:28,193
(from "It's Okay, That's Love", and the two became friends.)

560
00:21:28,493 --> 00:21:30,803
- Number Five, you're up. - Okay.

561
00:21:30,803 --> 00:21:33,503
- This person doesn't badmouth us? - No.

562
00:21:34,073 --> 00:21:36,233
- There wasn't a single time? - No.

563
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:38,773
Have you heard of this person complimenting...

564
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:40,813
- members of Running Man? - Yes.

565
00:21:40,813 --> 00:21:42,573
- Who was it? - Whom did this person compliment?

566
00:21:42,713 --> 00:21:46,243
This person said the members were nice and took care of this person.

567
00:21:46,243 --> 00:21:47,883
- That's it. - Who is it?

568
00:21:47,883 --> 00:21:49,153
- Who took care of this person? - Who was it?

569
00:21:49,553 --> 00:21:52,153
- It's Kwang Soo. - I see.

570
00:21:52,153 --> 00:21:53,223
(My friend, Kwang Soo)

571
00:21:53,223 --> 00:21:54,993
(Whose family member is that? Who complimented me?)

572
00:21:54,993 --> 00:21:57,693
Kwang Soo does take good care of us in general.

573
00:21:57,693 --> 00:22:00,163
- It's likely that So Min said that. - It could be So Min.

574
00:22:00,163 --> 00:22:01,463
If it's not So Min...

575
00:22:01,463 --> 00:22:03,993
- Wait. No. It's Ji Hyo's family. - It's Ji Hyo.

576
00:22:03,993 --> 00:22:06,663
- Is it Ji Hyo? - He said that person kicked him.

577
00:22:06,663 --> 00:22:07,703
- That's right. - She drinks a lot too.

578
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:10,133
- It's Ji Hyo. It is her brother. - Is it Ji Hyo?

579
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:12,043
(Number 5's family member who complimented me...)

580
00:22:12,043 --> 00:22:13,173
(is Ji Hyo?)

581
00:22:13,173 --> 00:22:14,513
- Wait. This means... - My brother hits me, actually.

582
00:22:15,343 --> 00:22:16,543
Number Four.

583
00:22:16,713 --> 00:22:19,543
Doesn't your friend compliment Ji Hyo?

584
00:22:19,543 --> 00:22:22,653
- Just think about it. - Hey, cut it out.

585
00:22:23,013 --> 00:22:25,453
(You brat.)

586
00:22:25,453 --> 00:22:26,453
(Hitting)

587
00:22:27,023 --> 00:22:28,123
(Ji Hyo becomes aggressive.)

588
00:22:28,123 --> 00:22:29,593
She's back.

589
00:22:29,593 --> 00:22:31,423
- Ji Hyo. - She's back.

590
00:22:31,423 --> 00:22:33,763
- It could have been worse. - She's angry.

591
00:22:33,763 --> 00:22:35,063
Be quiet.

592
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,263
(The big sister's love)

593
00:22:36,263 --> 00:22:38,563
All right. "I think..."

594
00:22:38,903 --> 00:22:40,663
"the family member is ugly."

595
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:42,673
1, 2, 3. Please show us your answer.

596
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:44,443
Three. Please show us your answer.

597
00:22:45,503 --> 00:22:47,303
X, X, O, O...

598
00:22:47,303 --> 00:22:48,313
(Three of them think their family member is ugly.)

599
00:22:48,313 --> 00:22:51,413
There are 3 O'x and 5 X's.

600
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:54,853
It must be Seok Jin, Kwang Soo,

601
00:22:54,853 --> 00:22:56,753
and Se Chan.

602
00:22:56,753 --> 00:23:01,153
(It must be Seok Jin, Kwang Soo, and Se Chan's family members.)

603
00:23:01,453 --> 00:23:03,593
- And Se Chan. - What?

604
00:23:03,593 --> 00:23:05,493
- The last one is for you. - What are you talking about?

605
00:23:05,493 --> 00:23:07,023
The last one is for you.

606
00:23:07,023 --> 00:23:08,463
- Jae Seok, Se Chan... - You're wrong.

607
00:23:08,463 --> 00:23:10,233
This is frustrating.

608
00:23:10,363 --> 00:23:12,633
Those who showed an X must be real family members.

609
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:14,173
- Let's ask them. - They must be family members.

610
00:23:14,173 --> 00:23:15,773
Number one.

611
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:18,273
- Yes. - You don't think...

612
00:23:18,543 --> 00:23:20,843
the family member is ugly?

613
00:23:20,843 --> 00:23:22,843
- No. - What do you think?

614
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,513
Which part is the most handsome?

615
00:23:26,313 --> 00:23:28,313
(Sighing)

616
00:23:28,313 --> 00:23:29,313
(Sighing)

617
00:23:29,313 --> 00:23:31,023
- He sighed. - He can't say anything.

618
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:32,023
He can't find an answer.

619
00:23:32,023 --> 00:23:34,123
Shouldn't you have chosen O then?

620
00:23:34,123 --> 00:23:35,893
Shouldn't you have chosen O then?

621
00:23:36,193 --> 00:23:38,523
(Flipping)

622
00:23:39,123 --> 00:23:42,033
He changed his answer.

623
00:23:42,363 --> 00:23:43,693
- He changed it. - He's so funny.

624
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,463
He must be a celebrity. He's not just a family member.

625
00:23:45,463 --> 00:23:46,803
- He changed his answer. - He changed it.

626
00:23:47,163 --> 00:23:49,373
- Is it Geun Sik? - Haha's friend...

627
00:23:49,373 --> 00:23:51,173
Do you love your friend?

628
00:23:53,403 --> 00:23:55,473
I don't exactly love him.

629
00:23:55,473 --> 00:23:58,543
(Let's see... Well...)

630
00:23:58,543 --> 00:24:00,013
(Angry)

631
00:24:00,043 --> 00:24:01,053
(Here you go.)

632
00:24:01,053 --> 00:24:03,153
What are you doing?

633
00:24:03,183 --> 00:24:05,223
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

634
00:24:05,223 --> 00:24:06,653
What are you doing?

635
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,493
- It might be someone else. - What if it's someone else?

636
00:24:08,493 --> 00:24:09,823
Then I'll apologize.

637
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,223
It might be someone else's family member.

638
00:24:11,223 --> 00:24:13,623
- I'm so disappointed. - Goodness.

639
00:24:15,293 --> 00:24:17,503
All right. Number seven.

640
00:24:17,503 --> 00:24:20,973
Can you rank your family member according to looks?

641
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:22,933
Fourth.

642
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:23,933
(4th)

643
00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:26,143
- Fourth? - It's in the middle.

644
00:24:26,143 --> 00:24:28,113
- That's not bad. - It might be me.

645
00:24:28,113 --> 00:24:29,573
It's quite high.

646
00:24:29,573 --> 00:24:33,743
Have you seen all the guests' faces?

647
00:24:33,743 --> 00:24:34,753
Yes.

648
00:24:34,753 --> 00:24:36,153
How high do you rank?

649
00:24:36,153 --> 00:24:37,553
(Haha asks an extra question.)

650
00:24:39,823 --> 00:24:40,853
(Well...)

651
00:24:40,853 --> 00:24:42,753
I rank first.

652
00:24:42,753 --> 00:24:44,393
You rank first?

653
00:24:44,393 --> 00:24:47,063
(He's So Min's little brother, Jeon Wook Min.)

654
00:24:47,063 --> 00:24:51,333
(Both the sister and brother are attractive.)

655
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:55,433
(So Min's brother works as a personal trainer.)

656
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:57,573
- I rank 1st. - You rank 1st?

657
00:24:57,643 --> 00:24:59,743
If I may,

658
00:25:00,203 --> 00:25:03,143
can I ask you who ranks lowest?

659
00:25:03,143 --> 00:25:04,583
Say a number.

660
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:07,613
Who ranks lowest?

661
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:09,583
Number two.

662
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:10,583
(Number 2)

663
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:12,453
- Number 2? - Number 2?

664
00:25:13,383 --> 00:25:14,453
(Me?)

665
00:25:14,453 --> 00:25:16,623
- Number two is the ugliest? - Who is it?

666
00:25:17,053 --> 00:25:18,693
Number two...

667
00:25:18,693 --> 00:25:20,263
Are you there?

668
00:25:20,663 --> 00:25:22,233
He might be hurt.

669
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:24,033
I'm very surprised.

670
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:26,803
(It's so funny.)

671
00:25:26,803 --> 00:25:30,233
This is very unexpected. I'm very surprised.

672
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:33,543
Who would you rank lowest?

673
00:25:33,743 --> 00:25:34,773
Well...

674
00:25:38,343 --> 00:25:39,943
Number eight.

675
00:25:39,943 --> 00:25:41,053
- Number 8? - Number 8?

676
00:25:41,053 --> 00:25:42,183
- Who is that? - Who is that?

677
00:25:42,183 --> 00:25:44,353
It must be a very close competition.

678
00:25:44,353 --> 00:25:46,423
- Number eight. - Yes?

679
00:25:46,423 --> 00:25:48,753
Which do you think looks better, number two or you?

680
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,193
- Number two? - Yes.

681
00:25:51,563 --> 00:25:54,833
That's ridiculous. Number two looks like garbage.

682
00:25:55,433 --> 00:25:57,193
Number two looks like garbage.

683
00:25:57,193 --> 00:26:00,633
(He fails to choose the right word.)

684
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:01,803
(They must be neck and neck.)

685
00:26:01,803 --> 00:26:03,033
They must know each other.

686
00:26:03,273 --> 00:26:05,043
Number two, are you okay?

687
00:26:05,043 --> 00:26:06,943
Are you okay?

688
00:26:06,943 --> 00:26:08,513
- Number two... - Go back to your seats.

689
00:26:08,813 --> 00:26:10,113
Number two looks like garbage?

690
00:26:10,113 --> 00:26:12,283
- Goodness. - It's so fierce.

691
00:26:12,283 --> 00:26:14,353
- They must know each other. - They know each other.

692
00:26:14,353 --> 00:26:15,753
That's why he can say that.

693
00:26:15,753 --> 00:26:17,953
That's why he can joke.

694
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:19,423
They know each other.

695
00:26:19,423 --> 00:26:20,683
All right.

696
00:26:20,683 --> 00:26:23,053
Among the guests...

697
00:26:23,053 --> 00:26:24,193
It's easy.

698
00:26:24,193 --> 00:26:25,793
The one you think is your family member...

699
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,933
- Do we stick this? - It's clear now.

700
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:29,763
Put it on the booth.

701
00:26:29,763 --> 00:26:31,103
Shall we?

702
00:26:31,863 --> 00:26:33,133
Do you think number seven is yours?

703
00:26:34,203 --> 00:26:35,233
Yes.

704
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,333
There's no confusion.

705
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,443
It's nice.

706
00:26:40,143 --> 00:26:43,573
Let's meet Haha's family member.

707
00:26:43,743 --> 00:26:45,643
Please come out.

708
00:26:45,943 --> 00:26:48,113
- We might be wrong. - I'm sure.

709
00:26:48,113 --> 00:26:49,183
- Who is it? - It's Geun Sik.

710
00:26:49,183 --> 00:26:51,923
- Geun Sik. - Geun Sik.

711
00:26:52,123 --> 00:26:53,453
(Haha and Geun Sik)

712
00:26:53,453 --> 00:26:54,923
My brother!

713
00:26:54,953 --> 00:26:57,153
Let's meet my family member.

714
00:26:57,563 --> 00:26:59,293
My arrogant friend.

715
00:27:00,023 --> 00:27:01,033
Hello.

716
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:02,863
Welcome.

717
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:05,063
Shouldn't he be seeing his patients?

718
00:27:05,433 --> 00:27:06,733
Poor guy.

719
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:09,103
- Sung Moon. - Sung Moon.

720
00:27:09,373 --> 00:27:11,743
Let's meet Se Chan's family member.

721
00:27:11,903 --> 00:27:13,473
It's Na Eun.

722
00:27:13,473 --> 00:27:15,943
She's so kind.

723
00:27:15,943 --> 00:27:17,343
This way, my lady.

724
00:27:17,343 --> 00:27:19,043
- This way, my lady. - Na Eun.

725
00:27:19,043 --> 00:27:21,153
- It must be her brother. - Right.

726
00:27:21,353 --> 00:27:24,583
(Jeon So Min and Jeon Wook Min)

727
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:27,023
- Hi. - Hi.

728
00:27:27,153 --> 00:27:29,523
(Jee Seok Jin and Kim Soo Yong)

729
00:27:29,753 --> 00:27:32,123
Finally, let's meet Kwang Soo's family member.

730
00:27:32,123 --> 00:27:33,123
Please come out.

731
00:27:34,563 --> 00:27:35,563
It's Hang Ho.

732
00:27:35,563 --> 00:27:36,663
(Shy)

733
00:27:36,663 --> 00:27:37,663
Oh, my.

734
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:40,433
You look even scarier now.

735
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:42,603
- Hang Ho. - Hang Ho.

736
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:43,873
I know him.

737
00:27:44,843 --> 00:27:46,873
This is the first time I've seen him in real life.

738
00:27:46,943 --> 00:27:48,273
What happened to your hair?

739
00:27:48,273 --> 00:27:50,673
I've seen him so many times on TV.

740
00:27:50,673 --> 00:27:53,143
- Me too. - When you came out,

741
00:27:53,143 --> 00:27:54,853
you looked so wild.

742
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:56,153
(I'm wild.)

743
00:27:56,153 --> 00:27:57,353
Right?

744
00:27:57,353 --> 00:27:58,553
He looks like Go Chang Suk.

745
00:27:58,553 --> 00:28:00,423
- Right. - I was...

746
00:28:00,423 --> 00:28:02,853
- a bit confused. - Right.

747
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:05,023
- He looks like Jo Jung Lin too. - Jo Jung Lin.

748
00:28:05,023 --> 00:28:06,093
Jo Jung Lin.

749
00:28:06,193 --> 00:28:07,663
He really looks like her.

750
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:10,433
He looks like her.

751
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:11,803
He looks like Miranda Kerr too.

752
00:28:11,803 --> 00:28:13,103
- That's right. - Miranda Kerr.

753
00:28:13,103 --> 00:28:15,533
(He surprisingly looks like Miranda Kerr too.)

754
00:28:15,533 --> 00:28:17,673
- He looks like Miranda Kerr. - He's amazing.

755
00:28:17,673 --> 00:28:19,473
- I see the resemblance. - How many people does he look like?

756
00:28:19,473 --> 00:28:20,473
He has a thousand faces.

757
00:28:20,473 --> 00:28:22,443
- He does look like Miranda Kerr. - He does.

758
00:28:22,443 --> 00:28:23,443
He has a thousand faces.

759
00:28:23,443 --> 00:28:24,843
- He really looks like her. - Yes.

760
00:28:24,843 --> 00:28:26,213
Excuse me, can you get out of my way?

761
00:28:26,213 --> 00:28:27,553
What?

762
00:28:27,553 --> 00:28:30,653
I can't see Sung Moon.

763
00:28:30,653 --> 00:28:31,953
It's okay.

764
00:28:31,953 --> 00:28:33,153
Is it okay?

765
00:28:33,153 --> 00:28:36,223
Aren't you Lee Jae Po?

766
00:28:36,223 --> 00:28:38,163
No, I'm not.

767
00:28:38,163 --> 00:28:39,863
He's my family member.

768
00:28:39,863 --> 00:28:41,463
- He's my family member. - He's Lee Jae Po.

769
00:28:41,463 --> 00:28:42,963
- Aren't you Lee Jae Po? - He's my family member.

770
00:28:42,963 --> 00:28:44,663
- It's okay. - I'll talk to him.

771
00:28:44,663 --> 00:28:46,233
I'll talk to him.

772
00:28:46,303 --> 00:28:47,903
- I'll talk to him. - It's okay.

773
00:28:47,903 --> 00:28:49,233
He's my family member.

774
00:28:49,303 --> 00:28:51,303
He looks familiar.

775
00:28:51,303 --> 00:28:53,043
He acts like him,

776
00:28:53,043 --> 00:28:54,473
- and sounds like him too. - Stop it.

777
00:28:54,473 --> 00:28:55,513
I'm...

778
00:28:55,843 --> 00:29:00,413
(Blind Mission Fees)

779
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:04,283
(The rain doesn't stop as if to celebrate their anniversary.)

780
00:29:04,283 --> 00:29:07,693
Our family members are here today.

781
00:29:07,693 --> 00:29:09,953
(Welcome)

782
00:29:09,953 --> 00:29:10,963
We're a family.

783
00:29:10,963 --> 00:29:12,793
We are the world!

784
00:29:13,063 --> 00:29:15,663
A summer vacation with family members,

785
00:29:15,663 --> 00:29:18,063
Dangerous Family Crisis.

786
00:29:18,063 --> 00:29:19,633
(Dangerous Family Crisis)

787
00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:22,673
You'll team up with your family member.

788
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:25,173
The team with the most money at the end will win.

789
00:29:25,573 --> 00:29:29,173
The winners will win a prize and be exempted from penalties.

790
00:29:29,173 --> 00:29:32,283
The team with the least money can choose one team...

791
00:29:32,283 --> 00:29:34,013
to receive the penalty together.

792
00:29:34,013 --> 00:29:35,453
Is it an ice shower?

793
00:29:35,953 --> 00:29:37,313
Is it an ice shower?

794
00:29:38,023 --> 00:29:39,853
- The losers can choose one team? - Yes.

795
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:43,023
After each mission,

796
00:29:43,023 --> 00:29:44,593
two teams with the highest scores...

797
00:29:44,593 --> 00:29:46,963
will be given the chance to change their family members.

798
00:29:46,963 --> 00:29:49,163
(2 top teams can change their family members.)

799
00:29:50,193 --> 00:29:51,203
Change family members?

800
00:29:51,203 --> 00:29:52,433
(Should I find a new family so that I can win?)

801
00:29:52,433 --> 00:29:54,303
Each family's fate can change all the time.

802
00:29:54,303 --> 00:29:55,303
You look happy.

803
00:29:55,403 --> 00:29:58,003
Even if your family member changes,

804
00:29:58,003 --> 00:29:59,543
you can keep your money.

805
00:29:59,573 --> 00:30:02,113
That's why you should divide the money wisely.

806
00:30:02,113 --> 00:30:03,113
(The amount of money is important.)

807
00:30:03,743 --> 00:30:07,953
(Stuck indoors, they become more and more aggressive.)

808
00:30:07,953 --> 00:30:12,953
(Protect your money to avoid an ice shower, and save the family.)

809
00:30:12,953 --> 00:30:18,393
(Who will win this battle among families?)

810
00:30:18,993 --> 00:30:21,733
Let's do...

811
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:23,963
- some more interviews... - Sure.

812
00:30:23,963 --> 00:30:27,503
before we start the game.

813
00:30:27,573 --> 00:30:28,833
- Sae Ho. - Yes.

814
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:30,903
I invited him.

815
00:30:30,903 --> 00:30:33,243
He's one of...

816
00:30:33,273 --> 00:30:36,243
- my closest friends. - Right.

817
00:30:36,313 --> 00:30:38,813
Sae Ho, I'll see you later.

818
00:30:38,813 --> 00:30:41,113
(I'll see you later.)

819
00:30:41,683 --> 00:30:42,683
(Is that it?)

820
00:30:42,683 --> 00:30:45,053
I'll see you later.

821
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:48,223
(They're too close.)

822
00:30:48,223 --> 00:30:50,493
As I said,

823
00:30:50,493 --> 00:30:52,663
Sae Ho is so busy these days.

824
00:30:52,663 --> 00:30:55,033
He's receiving so much love.

825
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:57,233
Luckily, he had time today.

826
00:30:57,363 --> 00:30:58,963
Thank you so much for coming.

827
00:30:58,963 --> 00:31:00,403
- Thank you. - All right then.

828
00:31:00,403 --> 00:31:02,533
(All right then.)

829
00:31:03,633 --> 00:31:05,943
You can find out about me...

830
00:31:05,943 --> 00:31:08,413
on other shows.

831
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:09,413
But...

832
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:11,113
He's our guest.

833
00:31:11,113 --> 00:31:12,783
I want to know more about him.

834
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:15,413
- Later... - Ask him a few basic questions.

835
00:31:15,413 --> 00:31:16,413
Ask him a question.

836
00:31:16,413 --> 00:31:19,053
When I invited you,

837
00:31:19,053 --> 00:31:21,053
you were doubtful.

838
00:31:21,153 --> 00:31:22,953
I wasn't exactly doubtful.

839
00:31:22,953 --> 00:31:25,923
I always wanted to be close with Jae Seok,

840
00:31:26,023 --> 00:31:27,023
but he never showed any response.

841
00:31:27,023 --> 00:31:31,233
(I wanted to know if we were close.)

842
00:31:31,233 --> 00:31:34,233
What he just said gave me too big of a burden.

843
00:31:35,473 --> 00:31:36,773
Jae Seok is like that.

844
00:31:37,003 --> 00:31:39,543
I feel too burdened.

845
00:31:40,643 --> 00:31:43,413
Jae Seok doesn't like it when people approach him quickly.

846
00:31:44,183 --> 00:31:45,843
I've known him for more than 10 years.

847
00:31:46,043 --> 00:31:47,553
- You're too hasty. - Now...

848
00:31:47,553 --> 00:31:50,953
- Am I? - You need at least 15 years.

849
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:52,123
- 15 years? - 15 years.

850
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:53,953
- You're almost there. - Yes.

851
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,453
It took me 22 years.

852
00:31:55,453 --> 00:31:56,693
22 years?

853
00:31:56,693 --> 00:31:59,423
I'll ask this question to the other guests too.

854
00:31:59,423 --> 00:32:02,663
In a word,

855
00:32:02,663 --> 00:32:05,333
what kind of a person am I to you?

856
00:32:05,663 --> 00:32:06,903
(Flustered)

857
00:32:07,103 --> 00:32:08,103
In one word.

858
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:10,873
That's an unexpected question.

859
00:32:11,373 --> 00:32:13,643
(His mind goes blank.)

860
00:32:14,113 --> 00:32:15,213
It's hard.

861
00:32:15,213 --> 00:32:19,113
- It's hard. - Can't you improvise?

862
00:32:19,113 --> 00:32:21,513
- Sure, you can. - Why do you say it's difficult?

863
00:32:22,053 --> 00:32:23,683
Soo Yong.

864
00:32:23,683 --> 00:32:25,423
How would you describe Seok Jin in one word?

865
00:32:25,553 --> 00:32:27,753
- Seok Jin is fickle. - Fickle?

866
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:31,363
- Is it time for him to leave? - That's great.

867
00:32:31,363 --> 00:32:33,763
It means that he's easily persuaded.

868
00:32:33,763 --> 00:32:35,933
- Don't say that. - He's not going to die.

869
00:32:35,933 --> 00:32:37,363
That's not what I mean.

870
00:32:37,363 --> 00:32:39,703
- He's easily persuaded. - How could he say that?

871
00:32:39,703 --> 00:32:41,803
Don't misunderstand.

872
00:32:41,933 --> 00:32:43,033
My goodness.

873
00:32:44,343 --> 00:32:46,543
How about you, Sung Moon?

874
00:32:46,543 --> 00:32:48,943
(Did he call him Sung Moon?)

875
00:32:48,943 --> 00:32:50,743
How would you describe Jong Kook in one word?

876
00:32:50,743 --> 00:32:52,443
He is Jong Myung.

877
00:32:52,883 --> 00:32:54,913
- Sung Moon is over there. - Jong Myung.

878
00:32:54,913 --> 00:32:57,313
Jong Myung, how would you describe him?

879
00:32:57,313 --> 00:32:58,483
He's Mother Bear.

880
00:32:58,483 --> 00:32:59,623
- Pardon me? - Mother Bear.

881
00:32:59,623 --> 00:33:00,893
- Mother Bear? Why? - Yes.

882
00:33:00,893 --> 00:33:02,193
He nags a lot.

883
00:33:03,993 --> 00:33:06,193
(He's like a mother bear at home.)

884
00:33:06,363 --> 00:33:09,093
What does he nag about these days?

885
00:33:09,893 --> 00:33:11,033
"Exercise."

886
00:33:11,203 --> 00:33:12,403
"Only do things that are healthy."

887
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:14,073
"Don't do unhealthy things."

888
00:33:14,303 --> 00:33:15,433
"Quit smoking."

889
00:33:16,073 --> 00:33:18,373
Aren't you suffering from gout?

890
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,413
- You really are. - What about my gout?

891
00:33:21,643 --> 00:33:23,913
- He can't walk well. - Yes, I have gout.

892
00:33:23,913 --> 00:33:27,213
It's not caused by something unhealthy.

893
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,513
(He thinks it's unfair.)

894
00:33:28,513 --> 00:33:30,153
Pardon me for asking,

895
00:33:30,313 --> 00:33:31,823
but do you have any illnesses?

896
00:33:31,823 --> 00:33:33,523
No, I don't.

897
00:33:33,523 --> 00:33:34,823
- You don't, right? - No.

898
00:33:34,823 --> 00:33:37,593
It happened while I was trying to be healthy.

899
00:33:37,693 --> 00:33:39,893
- He always has a cold in summer. - That's right.

900
00:33:40,023 --> 00:33:41,763
- Take care of your body. - What?

901
00:33:41,893 --> 00:33:44,403
You're a celebrity. You should take care of yourself.

902
00:33:44,463 --> 00:33:45,703
Move on, move on.

903
00:33:45,703 --> 00:33:47,703
(Go on while I'm being nice.)

904
00:33:47,703 --> 00:33:49,833
- He should take care of himself. - Next is Hang Ho.

905
00:33:50,103 --> 00:33:52,043
How would you describe...

906
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:53,773
Kwang Soo in one word?

907
00:33:54,043 --> 00:33:55,473
He doesn't know him well enough.

908
00:33:55,473 --> 00:33:56,713
- He does. - What comes to mind?

909
00:33:57,543 --> 00:33:59,983
(They don't seem very close.)

910
00:33:59,983 --> 00:34:01,283
- What comes to mind? - In one word.

911
00:34:01,283 --> 00:34:03,013
- He's a great actor. - A great actor?

912
00:34:03,013 --> 00:34:05,523
(He describes Kwang Soo as a great actor.)

913
00:34:05,523 --> 00:34:07,183
- What makes you say that? - Kwang Soo?

914
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,253
People usually say that when...

915
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:11,163
they don't know each other well.

916
00:34:11,163 --> 00:34:12,463
(It's a common way to describe a stranger.)

917
00:34:12,463 --> 00:34:14,933
Do you know each other well?

918
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:16,663
Otherwise, he wouldn't say that.

919
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,633
I don't think they're very close.

920
00:34:18,863 --> 00:34:20,633
They're not close at all.

921
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:23,403
Hang Ho doesn't describe people as "great actors".

922
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:25,003
To be honest,

923
00:34:25,803 --> 00:34:27,003
most people were...

924
00:34:27,103 --> 00:34:28,513
too busy.

925
00:34:29,273 --> 00:34:31,313
They're getting married.

926
00:34:32,383 --> 00:34:33,883
They have shoots.

927
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:36,413
Is that why he's here today?

928
00:34:36,413 --> 00:34:38,423
He's the closest among the rest.

929
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:40,053
I consider him as family.

930
00:34:40,053 --> 00:34:41,493
- Is that why he's here? - Yes.

931
00:34:41,693 --> 00:34:43,793
Thank you very much for coming.

932
00:34:43,793 --> 00:34:45,093
Kwang Soo.

933
00:34:45,093 --> 00:34:47,833
How would you describe Hang Ho in one word?

934
00:34:48,163 --> 00:34:50,533
When I'm with him,

935
00:34:51,233 --> 00:34:53,333
I stand out more.

936
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:55,733
(He thinks he stands out when he's with Hang Ho.)

937
00:34:55,733 --> 00:34:57,403
- Is that why you invited him? - No.

938
00:34:57,403 --> 00:34:59,403
- Is that why you invited him? - No, I swear.

939
00:34:59,403 --> 00:35:00,703
- You shouldn't do that. - That's not why.

940
00:35:00,703 --> 00:35:03,873
Of course, that's not why.

941
00:35:03,873 --> 00:35:05,313
I'm being honest.

942
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:07,043
Kwang Soo is so harsh.

943
00:35:07,043 --> 00:35:09,153
How could you say that after inviting him?

944
00:35:09,153 --> 00:35:10,783
Hang Ho described Kwang Soo...

945
00:35:11,123 --> 00:35:13,653
in a positive way.

946
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,523
I don't feel so good.

947
00:35:16,393 --> 00:35:17,623
- Goodness. - I see.

948
00:35:18,723 --> 00:35:21,363
I'd like to ask Wook Min next.

949
00:35:21,363 --> 00:35:23,993
(Wook Min is So Min's handsome brother.)

950
00:35:23,993 --> 00:35:25,963
Gosh, he's so handsome.

951
00:35:26,103 --> 00:35:27,363
He's charming.

952
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:28,573
He's a real man.

953
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:30,773
Wook Min is handsome.

954
00:35:30,773 --> 00:35:32,503
How would you describe her?

955
00:35:32,503 --> 00:35:34,003
Parrot and Frog.

956
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,843
As she's too talkative at home, your father calls her Parrot.

957
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:37,943
Is that true?

958
00:35:39,843 --> 00:35:45,023
(While her brother is handsome, So Min is talkative.)

959
00:35:45,023 --> 00:35:49,153
(Is she also talkative at home?)

960
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:52,163
In general, our family members are talkative.

961
00:35:52,993 --> 00:35:55,333
- Is that so? - Are you also talkative?

962
00:35:55,793 --> 00:35:57,193
When we're in the elevator,

963
00:35:57,193 --> 00:36:00,403
we must press the button to get to a certain floor.

964
00:36:00,903 --> 00:36:02,673
No one presses it.

965
00:36:02,673 --> 00:36:04,073
- Are you too busy talking? - Yes.

966
00:36:04,773 --> 00:36:06,243
They're too busy talking.

967
00:36:06,243 --> 00:36:08,573
- Do you keep talking instead? - Right.

968
00:36:08,913 --> 00:36:14,513
(Their family is always too busy talking.)

969
00:36:14,783 --> 00:36:18,553
Usually, people converse when they're in the car.

970
00:36:18,753 --> 00:36:19,823
We talk over each other.

971
00:36:20,793 --> 00:36:21,893
No one listens.

972
00:36:21,893 --> 00:36:23,553
We're like radios.

973
00:36:23,923 --> 00:36:26,693
(The family is busy talking about themselves.)

974
00:36:26,693 --> 00:36:27,993
So Min is like that.

975
00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:32,003
- That's exactly like So Min. - Right.

976
00:36:32,003 --> 00:36:33,403
So Min is like that.

977
00:36:33,403 --> 00:36:35,233
- She talks a lot about herself. - She does.

978
00:36:35,233 --> 00:36:37,773
Our father is also talkative.

979
00:36:37,773 --> 00:36:40,273
- He's very amicable. - He keeps talking.

980
00:36:41,113 --> 00:36:44,713
(Kwang Soo spent a night listening to So Min's father.)

981
00:36:44,713 --> 00:36:46,443
Could you talk about So Min?

982
00:36:46,443 --> 00:36:47,753
(He tells another story.)

983
00:36:47,753 --> 00:36:49,353
Before we go out,

984
00:36:50,013 --> 00:36:52,683
she only brushes her teeth.

985
00:36:53,523 --> 00:36:54,823
- She doesn't put on makeup? - No.

986
00:36:54,893 --> 00:36:55,953
Does she wash her face?

987
00:36:56,823 --> 00:36:58,093
I don't think so.

988
00:36:58,093 --> 00:37:00,463
(So Min is a little embarrassed.)

989
00:37:00,463 --> 00:37:02,463
- Is that embarrassing for you? - Yes.

990
00:37:02,733 --> 00:37:04,503
She wears crumpled caps.

991
00:37:04,503 --> 00:37:05,633
He hates that.

992
00:37:05,633 --> 00:37:07,063
- Why? - Crumpled caps?

993
00:37:07,063 --> 00:37:10,173
We went out for some beer recently.

994
00:37:10,503 --> 00:37:12,003
He talked about her cap for a long time.

995
00:37:12,003 --> 00:37:13,903
"Why do you wear caps like that?"

996
00:37:13,903 --> 00:37:15,473
Why are you meddling in their family business?

997
00:37:15,473 --> 00:37:20,583
(Hold on. Why are you involved?)

998
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:22,013
What's wrong with you?

999
00:37:22,213 --> 00:37:23,713
What's wrong with you?

1000
00:37:23,713 --> 00:37:26,223
You have more to say about them than Hang Ho.

1001
00:37:26,383 --> 00:37:28,193
I just remembered it.

1002
00:37:28,193 --> 00:37:30,193
Let's talk about Kwang Soo.

1003
00:37:30,193 --> 00:37:32,693
It's not true, and it's unlikely in the future.

1004
00:37:32,823 --> 00:37:35,433
What if Kwang Soo and So Min get into a relationship?

1005
00:37:35,793 --> 00:37:37,933
- What if? - Right.

1006
00:37:37,933 --> 00:37:39,203
- What if it happens? - What if?

1007
00:37:39,203 --> 00:37:40,363
How would you feel?

1008
00:37:40,363 --> 00:37:41,733
(As her younger brother...)

1009
00:37:41,733 --> 00:37:43,473
I'll be happy if she's happy.

1010
00:37:43,473 --> 00:37:47,343
(He's happy as long as she's happy.)

1011
00:37:47,343 --> 00:37:48,673
(Smiling)

1012
00:37:49,013 --> 00:37:50,073
Look at Kwang Soo.

1013
00:37:50,883 --> 00:37:52,213
Why do you look so happy?

1014
00:37:52,783 --> 00:37:57,623
(Why is he reacting this way to his response?)

1015
00:37:58,323 --> 00:37:59,883
- It's not because I'm happy. - Why do you look so happy?

1016
00:37:59,883 --> 00:38:00,893
That's not why.

1017
00:38:00,893 --> 00:38:02,323
It's nice to be complimented.

1018
00:38:02,793 --> 00:38:03,953
Compliments are nice.

1019
00:38:04,393 --> 00:38:05,963
How about you, Na Eun?

1020
00:38:06,563 --> 00:38:09,293
- I'm really curious about her. - How would you...

1021
00:38:09,293 --> 00:38:12,503
describe Se Chan in one word?

1022
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:16,233
(It's the most difficult question for Na Eun.)

1023
00:38:16,603 --> 00:38:23,543
(Na Eun doesn't even know Se Chan's phone number.)

1024
00:38:23,543 --> 00:38:29,253
(She doesn't know why she's invited as his family.)

1025
00:38:30,313 --> 00:38:32,553
(How will she describe Se Chan in one word?)

1026
00:38:32,553 --> 00:38:34,853
Say that he's a burden.

1027
00:38:36,653 --> 00:38:38,223
He's someone I want to get to know.

1028
00:38:38,223 --> 00:38:42,263
(She wants to get to know him.)

1029
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:45,363
- That's not bad. - Is that true?

1030
00:38:45,663 --> 00:38:46,933
That's not bad.

1031
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:49,303
Accept what she said. She wants to get to know me.

1032
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:53,503
Why do you keep buttoning and unbuttoning the shirt?

1033
00:38:53,503 --> 00:38:55,073
I don't know which looks better.

1034
00:38:55,173 --> 00:38:56,973
I'm trying to do what she prefers.

1035
00:38:57,513 --> 00:38:58,683
- It doesn't matter. - Is that so?

1036
00:38:58,743 --> 00:39:00,083
It's too much.

1037
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:02,513
Na Eun doesn't care about that. Just unbutton it.

1038
00:39:02,513 --> 00:39:04,383
You're just a friend.

1039
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,753
(Can't you see?)

1040
00:39:05,783 --> 00:39:08,123
She could meet up with you and her boyfriend.

1041
00:39:08,123 --> 00:39:10,293
Pardon me, but you aren't in the camera frame.

1042
00:39:10,293 --> 00:39:15,063
(Haha, you aren't in the camera frame.)

1043
00:39:15,863 --> 00:39:16,933
Come in.

1044
00:39:17,233 --> 00:39:18,333
What will you do?

1045
00:39:18,563 --> 00:39:20,103
The film set ends here.

1046
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:21,503
Come in.

1047
00:39:21,803 --> 00:39:22,903
Come in, Geun Sik.

1048
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:29,313
During the OX Quiz a moment ago,

1049
00:39:29,413 --> 00:39:31,343
there's a question I didn't ask.

1050
00:39:31,783 --> 00:39:34,713
Does your family member brag too much?

1051
00:39:35,153 --> 00:39:36,513
Geun Sik, what do you think about Haha?

1052
00:39:36,713 --> 00:39:37,753
He doesn't brag.

1053
00:39:38,053 --> 00:39:39,153
- He doesn't? - No.

1054
00:39:39,383 --> 00:39:41,923
- It sounds like you're lying. - I don't.

1055
00:39:41,923 --> 00:39:43,653
He has nothing to brag about.

1056
00:39:43,653 --> 00:39:47,293
(He doesn't brag because he has nothing to brag about.)

1057
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:51,263
(He has a headache.)

1058
00:39:52,063 --> 00:39:55,633
(Geun Sik's answer is genuine.)

1059
00:39:55,903 --> 00:39:57,873
- He has nothing to brag about. - Not at all?

1060
00:39:57,873 --> 00:39:58,973
Not at all.

1061
00:39:59,043 --> 00:40:00,403
Since he was in school?

1062
00:40:00,573 --> 00:40:01,613
It was worse back then.

1063
00:40:01,613 --> 00:40:05,213
(He had less to brag about back then.)

1064
00:40:05,283 --> 00:40:07,683
- Was he worse than before? - He was worse.

1065
00:40:07,683 --> 00:40:09,353
He had nothing to brag about.

1066
00:40:09,353 --> 00:40:11,383
Now that he's on TV, he has something.

1067
00:40:13,483 --> 00:40:18,723
(He had things to brag about when he started being on TV.)

1068
00:40:18,893 --> 00:40:20,063
I'm disappointed.

1069
00:40:20,893 --> 00:40:22,633
- I feel very disappointed. - All right then.

1070
00:40:22,893 --> 00:40:25,803
- You run a business together. - That's right.

1071
00:40:25,803 --> 00:40:27,803
Jae Seok, while you're interviewing other people,

1072
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:29,333
Sae Ho is very anxious.

1073
00:40:29,673 --> 00:40:31,003
He's wondering...

1074
00:40:31,003 --> 00:40:33,103
if you'll ask him any questions.

1075
00:40:34,313 --> 00:40:35,673
Will he just skip me?

1076
00:40:35,673 --> 00:40:38,013
(It was a moment ago.)

1077
00:40:39,283 --> 00:40:40,383
- Sae Ho. - Is it my turn again?

1078
00:40:40,383 --> 00:40:41,983
Yes, it is.

1079
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:43,713
How would you describe me in one word?

1080
00:40:43,813 --> 00:40:45,023
I'll just say that...

1081
00:40:45,553 --> 00:40:47,023
you're like iced coffee.

1082
00:40:47,853 --> 00:40:50,993
- Why do you say that? - That's my final word.

1083
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:52,123
Why am I like iced coffee?

1084
00:40:52,123 --> 00:40:53,863
I really like iced coffee.

1085
00:40:53,863 --> 00:40:56,433
- Is it because you also like me? - Yes.

1086
00:40:57,903 --> 00:40:58,933
That's it?

1087
00:40:58,933 --> 00:41:00,303
What's wrong with you?

1088
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,833
This is one of my weaknesses.

1089
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:04,803
I have strengths,

1090
00:41:04,903 --> 00:41:06,243
but I can't describe people in one word.

1091
00:41:06,343 --> 00:41:09,643
He gets flustered by unexpected questions.

1092
00:41:09,643 --> 00:41:11,743
The number of words I can use per day is limited to 100.

1093
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:13,383
Otherwise, it gets difficult.

1094
00:41:13,383 --> 00:41:15,513
- I really like you. - By the way,

1095
00:41:15,813 --> 00:41:20,583
I heard that you prepared something...

1096
00:41:20,653 --> 00:41:22,093
for today's show.

1097
00:41:22,093 --> 00:41:24,863
- Did I? - Didn't you?

1098
00:41:24,863 --> 00:41:25,863
I...

1099
00:41:26,623 --> 00:41:29,863
I heard Sae Ho knows the dance choreography to "New Face".

1100
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:32,103
It's because Na Eun is also invited to the show.

1101
00:41:32,203 --> 00:41:34,833
- The dance is popular these days. - You're right.

1102
00:41:35,003 --> 00:41:36,533
I like the dance.

1103
00:41:36,533 --> 00:41:39,003
The video of Na Eun's dance to "New Face" was viewed...

1104
00:41:39,003 --> 00:41:40,673
by almost a million.

1105
00:41:42,243 --> 00:41:45,213
(Her video has been viewed by 700,000 people.)

1106
00:41:45,213 --> 00:41:48,083
Can you dance to "New Face", Sae Ho?

1107
00:41:48,283 --> 00:41:49,983
Let's see Cho's Face.

1108
00:41:49,983 --> 00:41:52,853
- Cho's Face. - Be careful how you pronounce it.

1109
00:41:53,683 --> 00:41:55,353
- Cho's Face. - Say, "New Face".

1110
00:41:55,353 --> 00:41:56,823
Should I say, "New Face"?

1111
00:41:56,823 --> 00:41:59,023
- Let's call it Ho's Face. - Ho's Face.

1112
00:41:59,663 --> 00:42:01,133
Can you show us the dance?

1113
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:02,693
Why are you suddenly making me dance?

1114
00:42:02,693 --> 00:42:05,163
(He's surprised by their request.)

1115
00:42:05,163 --> 00:42:06,203
We were having a serious talk.

1116
00:42:06,203 --> 00:42:07,933
- We're family. - I can dance.

1117
00:42:07,933 --> 00:42:09,403
- It's because we're family. - It's so sudden.

1118
00:42:09,403 --> 00:42:10,903
- Can you dance? - Yes.

1119
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,173
- It's just a dance that I like. - I see.

1120
00:42:13,373 --> 00:42:15,543
- I never... - He's really going to dance.

1121
00:42:15,543 --> 00:42:17,713
volunteered to dance.

1122
00:42:18,683 --> 00:42:20,313
You said you'd dance to "New Face".

1123
00:42:20,313 --> 00:42:21,653
- I did? - Yes.

1124
00:42:21,653 --> 00:42:23,383
(He's confused.)

1125
00:42:23,753 --> 00:42:25,283
Look here.

1126
00:42:25,553 --> 00:42:27,153
"Cho Sae Ho, New Face".

1127
00:42:27,153 --> 00:42:28,723
- I don't... - Am I wrong?

1128
00:42:28,993 --> 00:42:31,223
- You debuted 17 years ago, right? - Yes.

1129
00:42:31,223 --> 00:42:32,923
- Through SBS's sixth recruitment? - Yes.

1130
00:42:32,923 --> 00:42:34,533
- You appear on "Happy Together". - Yes.

1131
00:42:34,533 --> 00:42:36,093
Below that, it says, "New Face".

1132
00:42:36,093 --> 00:42:37,903
I don't think so.

1133
00:42:37,903 --> 00:42:40,233
(That's odd.)

1134
00:42:40,703 --> 00:42:42,703
I don't think so.

1135
00:42:42,703 --> 00:42:44,943
(Only Jae Seok can see it.)

1136
00:42:44,943 --> 00:42:48,413
Why do you make him dance instead of asking him questions?

1137
00:42:49,373 --> 00:42:51,183
He can't talk well today.

1138
00:42:51,513 --> 00:42:53,213
Me?

1139
00:42:53,243 --> 00:42:54,813
(He's surprised once again.)

1140
00:42:54,853 --> 00:42:56,853
- I've been doing well. - No.

1141
00:42:56,853 --> 00:42:57,883
You're not talking very well.

1142
00:42:57,883 --> 00:43:00,283
- These days... - You're not doing well.

1143
00:43:00,353 --> 00:43:01,793
- I can talk. - Today,

1144
00:43:01,793 --> 00:43:03,423
just dance, play games, and go home.

1145
00:43:03,523 --> 00:43:05,963
My specialty is talking.

1146
00:43:06,323 --> 00:43:07,733
You're not talking very well.

1147
00:43:07,893 --> 00:43:09,533
- You're not doing well. - I have to dance?

1148
00:43:09,663 --> 00:43:11,933
Can you play some music?

1149
00:43:11,933 --> 00:43:13,263
Do you need it?

1150
00:43:13,263 --> 00:43:15,933
(Do you really need it?)

1151
00:43:15,933 --> 00:43:17,173
Do I have to dance without music?

1152
00:43:17,173 --> 00:43:18,773
"New Face" dance moves without any music?

1153
00:43:18,773 --> 00:43:20,913
All right. We'll play music.

1154
00:43:21,573 --> 00:43:24,283
You should have asked us.

1155
00:43:24,283 --> 00:43:25,783
I was just...

1156
00:43:25,783 --> 00:43:28,183
Sae Ho will dance to "New Face".

1157
00:43:28,183 --> 00:43:29,913
- Play the music. - Okay.

1158
00:43:29,913 --> 00:43:31,123
(Sae Ho's New Face)

1159
00:43:31,123 --> 00:43:32,853
(Breathing)

1160
00:43:33,383 --> 00:43:35,593
(Let me release...)

1161
00:43:35,593 --> 00:43:39,323
(the Psy-like vibes that I've been hiding inside me.)

1162
00:43:40,463 --> 00:43:41,863
(His face is dancing too.)

1163
00:43:41,863 --> 00:43:42,863
Yes!

1164
00:43:43,893 --> 00:43:47,133
(You said you weren't prepared.)

1165
00:43:47,703 --> 00:43:48,873
(Flapping)

1166
00:43:49,173 --> 00:43:54,343
(Yes, I want some Ho's Face)

1167
00:43:54,943 --> 00:43:58,043
(He dances with his whole body.)

1168
00:44:00,643 --> 00:44:02,053
(Broken)

1169
00:44:02,053 --> 00:44:03,113
(Ho's Face)

1170
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:08,893
(He looks exactly like Psy.)

1171
00:44:11,163 --> 00:44:14,793
(Bouncing)

1172
00:44:14,793 --> 00:44:18,263
(He finishes off by bouncing his belly.)

1173
00:44:18,263 --> 00:44:21,203
(This is Ho's Face.)

1174
00:44:21,203 --> 00:44:23,703
- Nice! - That was amazing.

1175
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:25,173
(His dance skills are better than ever.)

1176
00:44:25,173 --> 00:44:26,703
Great job.

1177
00:44:26,703 --> 00:44:28,973
That was amazing.

1178
00:44:30,613 --> 00:44:32,943
- You looked like you were in pain. - Really?

1179
00:44:32,943 --> 00:44:34,983
(You looked like you were in pain. )

1180
00:44:34,983 --> 00:44:36,153
Yes.

1181
00:44:36,153 --> 00:44:37,213
(Me?)

1182
00:44:38,053 --> 00:44:41,253
(His face contorted as if he was in pain.)

1183
00:44:41,523 --> 00:44:44,793
(I dance when I'm in pain.)

1184
00:44:45,923 --> 00:44:47,393
Na Eun, what did you think?

1185
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,693
- It was great. - It was amazing.

1186
00:44:49,793 --> 00:44:52,603
There is another person who wanted to dance.

1187
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:55,273
Let's see Hang Ho dance to "New Face".

1188
00:44:55,273 --> 00:44:56,873
- Did you want to do it? - No.

1189
00:44:56,873 --> 00:44:58,673
- "New Face"? - Hold on.

1190
00:44:58,673 --> 00:45:00,703
(You wanted to dance to "New Face"?)

1191
00:45:00,703 --> 00:45:03,013
- Hold on. - It says your name too.

1192
00:45:03,013 --> 00:45:04,413
He's ambitious.

1193
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:05,883
- Here. - I love it.

1194
00:45:05,883 --> 00:45:07,313
"Hang Ho, New Face".

1195
00:45:07,453 --> 00:45:08,753
Do you see it?

1196
00:45:08,753 --> 00:45:10,113
You debuted nine years ago, right?

1197
00:45:10,283 --> 00:45:12,283
- Well... Yes. - Right?

1198
00:45:12,283 --> 00:45:14,493
(He gives up.)

1199
00:45:14,493 --> 00:45:15,523
I thought I was going to dance with you.

1200
00:45:15,523 --> 00:45:17,423
You'll dance alone.

1201
00:45:17,563 --> 00:45:19,693
- Alone? - Yes.

1202
00:45:22,293 --> 00:45:23,393
He's very shy.

1203
00:45:23,393 --> 00:45:25,333
He's very shy and feminine.

1204
00:45:25,533 --> 00:45:27,873
Kwang Soo, show some support.

1205
00:45:27,873 --> 00:45:28,873
Hang Ho.

1206
00:45:29,173 --> 00:45:30,503
You already look funny.

1207
00:45:30,743 --> 00:45:32,443
(Giggling)

1208
00:45:32,443 --> 00:45:33,473
Just move your hips.

1209
00:45:33,473 --> 00:45:35,013
All right.

1210
00:45:35,013 --> 00:45:36,573
Hang Ho.

1211
00:45:36,573 --> 00:45:38,343
Give us some music.

1212
00:45:39,543 --> 00:45:42,683
(How will Hang Ho dance?)

1213
00:45:45,983 --> 00:45:47,453
(What's that?)

1214
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,693
He's so cute.

1215
00:45:49,853 --> 00:45:51,463
(Wriggling)

1216
00:45:51,463 --> 00:45:53,123
(Cute)

1217
00:45:53,293 --> 00:45:55,693
(He's too cute.)

1218
00:45:58,133 --> 00:45:59,303
He's so cute.

1219
00:45:59,303 --> 00:46:01,033
(So Min likes it.)

1220
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,403
(The guys can't stand it.)

1221
00:46:03,403 --> 00:46:04,543
Miss.

1222
00:46:04,973 --> 00:46:06,343
This is hilarious.

1223
00:46:06,443 --> 00:46:10,243
(He dances even more prettily than Na Eun did.)

1224
00:46:10,243 --> 00:46:11,243
This is amazing!

1225
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:13,243
This is amazing.

1226
00:46:13,713 --> 00:46:14,853
He's so cute.

1227
00:46:14,853 --> 00:46:17,113
Go back to your seat.

1228
00:46:17,423 --> 00:46:18,823
Hold on.

1229
00:46:18,823 --> 00:46:21,193
It was so feminine.

1230
00:46:22,423 --> 00:46:23,853
He's very feminine.

1231
00:46:24,993 --> 00:46:26,163
That was amazing.

1232
00:46:26,623 --> 00:46:28,333
He's so lovely.

1233
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:30,763
- That was great. All right. - He's so lovely.

1234
00:46:30,763 --> 00:46:33,003
There is another person who wanted to dance to "New Face".

1235
00:46:34,003 --> 00:46:35,203
Can you do it?

1236
00:46:35,203 --> 00:46:36,403
- No. - I think he can.

1237
00:46:36,403 --> 00:46:37,973
- He can. - He can.

1238
00:46:38,073 --> 00:46:39,503
- He can do it. - Stand up.

1239
00:46:39,503 --> 00:46:41,073
Just a quick one.

1240
00:46:41,273 --> 00:46:43,213
- Suddenly... - You can do it.

1241
00:46:43,273 --> 00:46:44,743
- You can do it. - It's war.

1242
00:46:44,743 --> 00:46:46,183
(You can do it.)

1243
00:46:46,613 --> 00:46:48,213
- Be confident. - I don't know the song.

1244
00:46:48,213 --> 00:46:49,653
- Sorry? - I don't know the song.

1245
00:46:49,653 --> 00:46:51,423
The song? You just saw the others do it.

1246
00:46:51,423 --> 00:46:52,953
- You can mimic them. - Just mimic them.

1247
00:46:52,953 --> 00:46:55,093
Give us some music.

1248
00:46:55,093 --> 00:46:57,463
(How will this quiet guy dance?)

1249
00:46:57,463 --> 00:46:59,463
- 1, 2, 3, 4. - 1, 2, 3, 4.

1250
00:46:59,923 --> 00:47:02,693
(Hesitating)

1251
00:47:03,533 --> 00:47:04,963
(You can do it.)

1252
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:10,803
(What is that?)

1253
00:47:14,643 --> 00:47:16,343
(Inappropriate)

1254
00:47:17,743 --> 00:47:19,783
(It's not appropriate for the show.)

1255
00:47:20,853 --> 00:47:23,913
(Why did he close his eyes?)

1256
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:30,763
(The moves were not suitable for children.)

1257
00:47:31,493 --> 00:47:34,063
(My brother...)

1258
00:47:34,063 --> 00:47:35,793
What did you do?

1259
00:47:35,793 --> 00:47:37,293
I'm sorry.

1260
00:47:37,293 --> 00:47:39,133
It's okay. Sit down.

1261
00:47:39,133 --> 00:47:40,133
Sit down.

1262
00:47:40,633 --> 00:47:42,473
You said you weren't prepared.

1263
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:45,903
(Thank you for showing off your sexy charms.)

1264
00:47:45,903 --> 00:47:48,673
Let's see Na Eun dance.

1265
00:47:48,673 --> 00:47:51,843
(It's Na Eun's turn.)

1266
00:47:52,143 --> 00:47:54,183
Her dance moves are so controlled.

1267
00:47:54,283 --> 00:47:55,583
You know her, right?

1268
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:56,583
She's the originator.

1269
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:57,653
(The originator steps onto the stage.)

1270
00:47:57,983 --> 00:47:59,583
She's so passionate.

1271
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:00,753
She's beautiful.

1272
00:48:02,053 --> 00:48:03,823
Music, please.

1273
00:48:03,853 --> 00:48:06,793
(Enjoy the originator's vibes.)

1274
00:48:07,793 --> 00:48:09,133
(Excited)

1275
00:48:09,793 --> 00:48:12,503
(This is the original.)

1276
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:15,873
(After smiling shyly,)

1277
00:48:15,973 --> 00:48:19,643
(she shows off her charms using her whole body.)

1278
00:48:20,003 --> 00:48:21,013
(I love you.)

1279
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,173
(Look at...)

1280
00:48:23,173 --> 00:48:24,713
(how sexy she is.)

1281
00:48:25,243 --> 00:48:28,753
(All the guys' hearts are on fire.)

1282
00:48:29,413 --> 00:48:32,453
(Let me show you the original moves.)

1283
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:37,423
(Fatal charms)

1284
00:48:39,223 --> 00:48:40,733
(Na Eun is the definition of love.)

1285
00:48:40,733 --> 00:48:42,363
Na Eun is the best.

1286
00:48:42,993 --> 00:48:44,703
Na Eun, thank you.

1287
00:48:44,703 --> 00:48:46,103
You're the best.

1288
00:48:46,863 --> 00:48:47,973
Thank you.

1289
00:48:50,073 --> 00:48:52,573
(Despite their enthusiasm,)

1290
00:48:52,573 --> 00:48:56,143
(the heavy rain doesn't stop.)

1291
00:48:56,373 --> 00:48:58,643
(They won't be able to go outside.)

1292
00:48:58,643 --> 00:49:00,483
It's still raining a lot.

1293
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:02,713
We won't be able to do any outdoor missions.

1294
00:49:02,713 --> 00:49:05,383
(The next mission will be carried out indoors too.)

1295
00:49:05,383 --> 00:49:07,823
Everyone, are your bodies warmed up now?

1296
00:49:08,823 --> 00:49:11,093
Too much. Our muscles have no energy left.

1297
00:49:11,923 --> 00:49:15,193
All right. Let's start the games now.

1298
00:49:15,193 --> 00:49:17,363
(Let's start the games now.)

1299
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:20,973
- Was this just the opening? - Yes.

1300
00:49:21,733 --> 00:49:23,373
- Up until now? - Yes.

1301
00:49:24,273 --> 00:49:25,703
(For two hours?)

1302
00:49:25,703 --> 00:49:27,143
It was just the opening.

1303
00:49:27,143 --> 00:49:28,313
Unbelievable.

1304
00:49:28,743 --> 00:49:31,043
All right. All family members,

1305
00:49:31,043 --> 00:49:33,913
welcome. Let's start the next mission.

1306
00:49:33,913 --> 00:49:36,453
Family Contest.

1307
00:49:36,453 --> 00:49:38,423
(Family Contest)

1308
00:49:39,283 --> 00:49:40,553
(Dancing)

1309
00:49:41,253 --> 00:49:42,853
(The siblings dance together.)

1310
00:49:42,853 --> 00:49:44,363
(Laughing)

1311
00:49:44,363 --> 00:49:46,623
(He shows off his charms.)

1312
00:49:48,063 --> 00:49:49,893
Please sit down.

1313
00:49:50,233 --> 00:49:53,633
A member will introduce his or her family member's specialty.

1314
00:49:53,633 --> 00:49:55,073
If you think you or your family member...

1315
00:49:55,073 --> 00:49:58,503
can outdo the person, participate in the game.

1316
00:49:58,503 --> 00:49:59,943
- Okay. - It's a competition between teams.

1317
00:49:59,943 --> 00:50:02,973
Only one person can participate from each team.

1318
00:50:02,973 --> 00:50:05,383
The winning team will be...

1319
00:50:05,383 --> 00:50:10,113
given 10 dollars.

1320
00:50:10,113 --> 00:50:11,653
10 dollars is big.

1321
00:50:11,653 --> 00:50:13,123
- It is. - It is.

1322
00:50:13,183 --> 00:50:15,723
Jae Seok will...

1323
00:50:15,823 --> 00:50:18,593
announce Sae Ho's...

1324
00:50:18,823 --> 00:50:19,893
specialty.

1325
00:50:19,893 --> 00:50:23,063
Sae Ho's specialty is keeping balance.

1326
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:24,563
- Keeping balance? - Keeping balance?

1327
00:50:24,933 --> 00:50:28,103
(Sae Ho's specialty: Keeping balance)

1328
00:50:28,503 --> 00:50:31,443
After turning 20 times,

1329
00:50:32,043 --> 00:50:33,503
- That's hard. - without faltering,

1330
00:50:33,503 --> 00:50:35,173
- I can walk straight. - Really?

1331
00:50:35,373 --> 00:50:38,313
I can put ink on my partner's nose.

1332
00:50:38,313 --> 00:50:39,613
- Really? - Is that possible?

1333
00:50:39,613 --> 00:50:40,813
20 times?

1334
00:50:40,813 --> 00:50:41,883
20 times.

1335
00:50:41,883 --> 00:50:42,913
- He'll turn 20 times. - 20 times.

1336
00:50:42,913 --> 00:50:44,423
That must be hard.

1337
00:50:44,423 --> 00:50:47,693
We can't even turn five times. We've done it.

1338
00:50:48,723 --> 00:50:50,653
(In the Thief Race,)

1339
00:50:50,653 --> 00:50:54,333
(they had a hard time keeping balance after turning.)

1340
00:50:54,533 --> 00:50:56,863
(Turning 5 times was hard.)

1341
00:50:56,863 --> 00:50:58,963
(How will he turn 20 times?)

1342
00:50:59,003 --> 00:51:00,433
It's going to be hard.

1343
00:51:00,633 --> 00:51:01,633
You do it.

1344
00:51:02,033 --> 00:51:03,073
Can't you do it?

1345
00:51:03,173 --> 00:51:05,103
Sae Ho, can you really do it?

1346
00:51:05,303 --> 00:51:06,773
I do it often.

1347
00:51:06,773 --> 00:51:07,843
- Really? - Yes.

1348
00:51:07,843 --> 00:51:09,643
(I do it often.)

1349
00:51:09,643 --> 00:51:10,943
Why do you do it often?

1350
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:13,143
Some people never become dizzy.

1351
00:51:13,143 --> 00:51:16,383
- It improves your sense of balance. - Right.

1352
00:51:16,483 --> 00:51:18,723
Let's see. Ready.

1353
00:51:20,153 --> 00:51:22,193
(I do it often.)

1354
00:51:22,193 --> 00:51:23,793
Turn 20 times. Start.

1355
00:51:23,793 --> 00:51:25,823
(Turning 20 times is no problem.)

1356
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,433
(How well will he do it?)

1357
00:51:28,433 --> 00:51:30,363
- 1, 2... - He's so fast.

1358
00:51:30,933 --> 00:51:35,403
(His heavy body turns fast.)

1359
00:51:37,203 --> 00:51:39,203
(He's turned 10 times already.)

1360
00:51:39,203 --> 00:51:40,813
- I think he's dizzy. - 8, 9...

1361
00:51:41,573 --> 00:51:43,643
- He's not going to make it. - 14, 15,

1362
00:51:43,973 --> 00:51:46,143
- 16... - He's not going to make it.

1363
00:51:46,683 --> 00:51:48,883
(Sae Ho is becoming unstable.)

1364
00:51:48,883 --> 00:51:51,253
- Just 2 more times. - Last 1.

1365
00:51:51,253 --> 00:51:52,953
- 20. - Go.

1366
00:51:52,953 --> 00:51:54,293
(He's turned 20 times.)

1367
00:51:54,293 --> 00:51:56,653
(He has to walk straight now.)

1368
00:51:56,653 --> 00:51:58,893
(Jae Seok,)

1369
00:51:58,893 --> 00:52:01,663
(here I come.)

1370
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,293
(Without wobbling)

1371
00:52:05,333 --> 00:52:07,163
(Will Sae Ho be able to put the ink on Jae Seok's nose?)

1372
00:52:07,263 --> 00:52:08,403
(Accurate)

1373
00:52:09,603 --> 00:52:10,803
(Sae Ho succeeds.)

1374
00:52:10,803 --> 00:52:11,873
Really?

1375
00:52:12,643 --> 00:52:13,843
(Unbelievable)

1376
00:52:13,843 --> 00:52:15,773
- It's... - That must be hard.

1377
00:52:16,243 --> 00:52:17,443
He didn't even wobble.

1378
00:52:17,443 --> 00:52:18,843
- Are you okay? - Yes.

1379
00:52:19,213 --> 00:52:20,243
I got it.

1380
00:52:20,953 --> 00:52:22,113
- Are you okay? - Yes.

1381
00:52:22,113 --> 00:52:25,423
Next up is someone who volunteered to do it.

1382
00:52:25,423 --> 00:52:26,953
- Who is it? - It's Sung Moon.

1383
00:52:26,953 --> 00:52:29,593
(Ji Hyo's brother gives it a try.)

1384
00:52:29,593 --> 00:52:32,463
- Sung Moon exercises a lot. - That's right.

1385
00:52:32,723 --> 00:52:33,893
I'll start.

1386
00:52:33,893 --> 00:52:35,993
(By the way...)

1387
00:52:35,993 --> 00:52:37,363
Are you okay, Sae Ho?

1388
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:39,003
Yes, don't worry about me.

1389
00:52:40,663 --> 00:52:41,773
He shouldn't have done it.

1390
00:52:41,773 --> 00:52:43,873
I just need to catch my breath.

1391
00:52:43,933 --> 00:52:45,773
You're sweating so much.

1392
00:52:45,773 --> 00:52:47,203
I'm very hot right now.

1393
00:52:47,673 --> 00:52:49,113
I'm very hot.

1394
00:52:49,143 --> 00:52:50,843
I exerted too much energy.

1395
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:52,643
- Your face is very red. - Right.

1396
00:52:52,643 --> 00:52:54,153
You look sick, Sae Ho.

1397
00:52:54,153 --> 00:52:56,213
Get ready, Sung Moon.

1398
00:52:56,213 --> 00:52:57,213
You can do it, Sung Moon.

1399
00:52:57,213 --> 00:52:58,853
(Unlike Sae Ho,)

1400
00:52:58,853 --> 00:53:00,553
(he'll walk towards her quickly.)

1401
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:03,193
- Start. - You can do it.

1402
00:53:03,623 --> 00:53:04,723
That looks great.

1403
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,693
(Ji Hyo, I'm coming.)

1404
00:53:06,693 --> 00:53:07,893
He's doing well.

1405
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,833
- He turns easily. - You're doing well.

1406
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:11,603
If Sung Moon succeeds...

1407
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,433
- Okay. - 16.

1408
00:53:13,433 --> 00:53:14,973
- He'll make it. - 17.

1409
00:53:14,973 --> 00:53:16,333
- He turns quickly. - He's so fast.

1410
00:53:16,333 --> 00:53:17,843
You're doing well.

1411
00:53:17,843 --> 00:53:19,043
- That's great. - He'll make it.

1412
00:53:19,043 --> 00:53:20,143
- He's done. - Go.

1413
00:53:20,143 --> 00:53:21,543
Let's go.

1414
00:53:21,973 --> 00:53:23,943
(Now,)

1415
00:53:23,943 --> 00:53:25,983
(he starts walking.)

1416
00:53:25,983 --> 00:53:28,313
(He goes to touch her nose.)

1417
00:53:28,313 --> 00:53:30,253
Here he goes.

1418
00:53:30,253 --> 00:53:31,683
(He falls down.)

1419
00:53:32,553 --> 00:53:37,253
(He falls on the floor instead of going toward Ji Hyo.)

1420
00:53:37,253 --> 00:53:38,693
My goodness.

1421
00:53:39,123 --> 00:53:40,523
Are you okay, Sung Moon.

1422
00:53:40,523 --> 00:53:43,693
- Sung Moon. - You wanted to touch her face.

1423
00:53:43,693 --> 00:53:45,533
You wanted to touch her face.

1424
00:53:45,533 --> 00:53:46,863
(My poor brother)

1425
00:53:46,863 --> 00:53:47,903
He collapsed.

1426
00:53:48,273 --> 00:53:50,033
He wanted to touch your nose.

1427
00:53:50,473 --> 00:53:52,403
His look was so determined.

1428
00:53:52,403 --> 00:53:54,213
I felt it in his look.

1429
00:53:54,213 --> 00:53:55,243
(Sung Moon fails.)

1430
00:53:56,043 --> 00:53:57,713
I bet Hang Ho can do it.

1431
00:53:57,713 --> 00:53:59,243
- Do you want to try? - I bet he can.

1432
00:53:59,243 --> 00:54:00,443
He's very sensitive.

1433
00:54:00,443 --> 00:54:02,253
I bet he can do well.

1434
00:54:02,253 --> 00:54:03,783
I think he'll turn in a pretty way.

1435
00:54:03,783 --> 00:54:05,383
He'll be elegant.

1436
00:54:06,153 --> 00:54:07,423
He's very elegant.

1437
00:54:07,423 --> 00:54:09,323
I have a bad sense of balance.

1438
00:54:09,453 --> 00:54:13,363
If you succeed, you win 10 dollars.

1439
00:54:13,363 --> 00:54:15,593
(In that case,)

1440
00:54:15,593 --> 00:54:17,663
(I'll try my best.)

1441
00:54:17,663 --> 00:54:19,163
He's determined.

1442
00:54:19,163 --> 00:54:20,163
He can be cute.

1443
00:54:20,263 --> 00:54:21,873
Start. One.

1444
00:54:21,873 --> 00:54:23,203
- He's quick. - Two.

1445
00:54:23,673 --> 00:54:25,743
3, 4.

1446
00:54:25,743 --> 00:54:27,773
- 5, 6. - He turns like a ballerina.

1447
00:54:28,513 --> 00:54:32,513
(He looks like a dancer in Swan Lake.)

1448
00:54:32,513 --> 00:54:34,713
- You have 10 turns left. - 1.

1449
00:54:35,053 --> 00:54:36,213
- Two. - He's got it.

1450
00:54:36,213 --> 00:54:37,623
- Sir. - Nine.

1451
00:54:37,683 --> 00:54:39,423
- Go. - He's done.

1452
00:54:39,753 --> 00:54:41,053
- Go. - Sir.

1453
00:54:41,053 --> 00:54:47,793
(After making 20 turns, it's time to spread his wings.)

1454
00:54:47,793 --> 00:54:50,863
Sir! Oh my, I'm so dizzy.

1455
00:54:52,663 --> 00:54:56,203
(He remains elegant even when he's dizzy.)

1456
00:54:57,333 --> 00:55:00,543
(He's so adorable.)

1457
00:55:00,773 --> 00:55:02,843
Are you okay?

1458
00:55:02,973 --> 00:55:04,913
I'm sorry, Hang Ho.

1459
00:55:05,043 --> 00:55:06,943
You did a good job.

1460
00:55:06,943 --> 00:55:08,653
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

1461
00:55:08,653 --> 00:55:10,453
- I'm really sorry. - Hang Ho.

1462
00:55:10,453 --> 00:55:12,323
- I'm sorry, Hang Ho. - I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

1463
00:55:14,253 --> 00:55:15,523
Give it a try.

1464
00:55:15,753 --> 00:55:17,463
- No. - Try it now.

1465
00:55:17,463 --> 00:55:18,723
- I can't. - Do it now!

1466
00:55:18,723 --> 00:55:19,963
I get dizzy easily.

1467
00:55:19,963 --> 00:55:21,493
I understand. Just do it.

1468
00:55:21,533 --> 00:55:22,963
- You could win. - Let's go, Geun Sik.

1469
00:55:22,963 --> 00:55:24,903
- It's your chance. - It can be dizzy.

1470
00:55:24,903 --> 00:55:25,963
I get dizzy easily.

1471
00:55:25,963 --> 00:55:27,363
You should concentrate.

1472
00:55:27,703 --> 00:55:29,173
"You should concentrate"?

1473
00:55:29,703 --> 00:55:31,443
- Come on, Haha. - Tell us if you can't continue.

1474
00:55:31,443 --> 00:55:32,743
- Hold on. - Turn 20 times.

1475
00:55:32,743 --> 00:55:34,413
Be confident.

1476
00:55:34,413 --> 00:55:35,643
- What? - Is this it?

1477
00:55:36,343 --> 00:55:39,513
(He must grab his nose before turning.)

1478
00:55:39,513 --> 00:55:40,753
How do I do it?

1479
00:55:40,753 --> 00:55:43,513
This isn't very difficult.

1480
00:55:43,513 --> 00:55:45,723
- I got confused. - Come on, you can do it.

1481
00:55:45,723 --> 00:55:46,883
I'm ready.

1482
00:55:46,883 --> 00:55:48,293
Start.

1483
00:55:48,793 --> 00:55:49,793
Wait a minute.

1484
00:55:49,793 --> 00:55:50,823
(He stops.)

1485
00:55:51,323 --> 00:55:53,423
- 1, 2. Start. - Here I go.

1486
00:55:54,063 --> 00:55:55,233
That's right.

1487
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:56,693
- 2. - 2.

1488
00:55:57,063 --> 00:55:58,063
- 3. - 3.

1489
00:55:58,663 --> 00:55:59,903
(Haha is nervous.)

1490
00:56:00,663 --> 00:56:01,833
Eight.

1491
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,603
- Nine. - That's right.

1492
00:56:03,603 --> 00:56:04,843
- 11. - 11.

1493
00:56:04,843 --> 00:56:06,343
- He's too dizzy. - Wait.

1494
00:56:06,343 --> 00:56:07,743
(He falls down.)

1495
00:56:08,313 --> 00:56:10,213
- He's too dizzy. - Wait.

1496
00:56:10,213 --> 00:56:11,983
(He can't lift his head.)

1497
00:56:11,983 --> 00:56:14,013
Wait a minute.

1498
00:56:14,053 --> 00:56:16,553
- Wait a minute. - He turned red.

1499
00:56:16,553 --> 00:56:18,783
Give me some time.

1500
00:56:18,783 --> 00:56:19,783
Wait a minute.

1501
00:56:19,783 --> 00:56:21,423
Come on, Geun Sik.

1502
00:56:21,423 --> 00:56:22,993
I'm sorry.

1503
00:56:23,053 --> 00:56:24,423
Wait a minute.

1504
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:25,623
Give me some time.

1505
00:56:25,623 --> 00:56:27,123
- Stay seated. - I'm sorry.

1506
00:56:27,123 --> 00:56:28,563
The shoot isn't over yet.

1507
00:56:28,633 --> 00:56:31,103
(Why is Haha embarrassed?)

1508
00:56:31,563 --> 00:56:32,703
You'll have more chances.

1509
00:56:32,703 --> 00:56:34,233
(Jae Seok and Sae Ho win 10 dollars.)

1510
00:56:34,403 --> 00:56:36,873
Next is Hang Ho and Kwang Soo. What is it?

1511
00:56:36,873 --> 00:56:39,943
My family member is good at making high-pitched sounds.

1512
00:56:39,943 --> 00:56:40,973
(High-pitched sounds)

1513
00:56:41,473 --> 00:56:44,713
(Hang Ho is the best at making high-pitched sounds.)

1514
00:56:45,343 --> 00:56:47,343
Are you doing that in front of Jong Kook?

1515
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:48,613
(It's a competition.)

1516
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,553
Let's hear him.

1517
00:56:51,323 --> 00:56:52,953
I forgot about Jong Kook.

1518
00:56:53,523 --> 00:56:55,023
I had no idea.

1519
00:56:55,653 --> 00:56:58,863
Let's hear him. My voice is in a bad condition as I drank recently.

1520
00:56:58,893 --> 00:57:01,863
Hang Ho's mission is a competition of...

1521
00:57:01,863 --> 00:57:05,363
making high-pitched sounds. It's called Hello, Cleopatra.

1522
00:57:05,363 --> 00:57:08,473
Read while raising an octave for every given sentence.

1523
00:57:08,473 --> 00:57:10,943
Hello, Cleopatra

1524
00:57:11,043 --> 00:57:13,473
The best potato chips in the world

1525
00:57:13,473 --> 00:57:16,743
- The next person says... - Hello, Cleopatra

1526
00:57:16,973 --> 00:57:19,583
The best potato chips in the world

1527
00:57:19,713 --> 00:57:21,853
Yes, that's it.

1528
00:57:21,853 --> 00:57:24,523
He can sing an entire song in one female tone.

1529
00:57:24,523 --> 00:57:27,053
I'm confident that he can compete with women.

1530
00:57:27,053 --> 00:57:30,453
Who would like to compete with him?

1531
00:57:30,553 --> 00:57:31,763
- Na Eun? - Yes.

1532
00:57:31,763 --> 00:57:33,223
- Na Eun will try. - Okay.

1533
00:57:33,323 --> 00:57:34,333
Who else?

1534
00:57:34,363 --> 00:57:35,363
So Min.

1535
00:57:35,363 --> 00:57:36,533
(So Min volunteers.)

1536
00:57:36,533 --> 00:57:38,003
Geun Sik will do it.

1537
00:57:38,003 --> 00:57:39,403
- Geun Sik? That sounds good. - Yes.

1538
00:57:39,603 --> 00:57:41,003
I'll do it.

1539
00:57:41,003 --> 00:57:42,873
- Jong Kook? - How about you?

1540
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:45,103
- I'll do it. - You will?

1541
00:57:48,513 --> 00:57:50,543
- Please stand up. - Does everyone stand up?

1542
00:57:50,883 --> 00:57:51,943
Stand in line.

1543
00:57:51,943 --> 00:57:55,513
Based on our objective judgment, we'll eliminate you...

1544
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,953
if the tone is too low.

1545
00:57:56,953 --> 00:57:57,953
Here we go.

1546
00:57:57,953 --> 00:58:01,553
(Family members with high tones come together.)

1547
00:58:01,553 --> 00:58:04,263
Let's get started already.

1548
00:58:04,263 --> 00:58:06,593
(Will Hang Ho be able to win?)

1549
00:58:06,863 --> 00:58:07,963
Here we go.

1550
00:58:08,263 --> 00:58:10,863
Hello, Cleopatra

1551
00:58:10,963 --> 00:58:13,763
The best potato chips in the world

1552
00:58:14,133 --> 00:58:18,703
(She raises the tone by one octave.)

1553
00:58:20,973 --> 00:58:23,613
- Hello, Cleopatra - That's right. She raised it.

1554
00:58:23,613 --> 00:58:25,613
(Let's raise the tone.)

1555
00:58:25,683 --> 00:58:29,213
- It's going up. - The best potato chips in the world

1556
00:58:29,353 --> 00:58:32,283
Hello, Cleopatra

1557
00:58:32,553 --> 00:58:35,753
(He wants to fight with Cleopatra.)

1558
00:58:35,753 --> 00:58:38,493
(His voice sounds tough as if he'd steal potato chips.)

1559
00:58:39,223 --> 00:58:43,763
(He gets competitive.)

1560
00:58:45,463 --> 00:58:50,843
(Seok Jin struggles to raise the tone.)

1561
00:58:51,843 --> 00:58:54,743
Hello, Cleopatra

1562
00:58:55,213 --> 00:58:58,313
(She raises her tone with her nose.)

1563
00:58:58,313 --> 00:59:02,983
- Hello, Cleopatra - He sounds like a mosquito.

1564
00:59:02,983 --> 00:59:05,323
(He sounds like a flying potato chip.)

1565
00:59:05,323 --> 00:59:07,283
- There it is. - Best potato chips in the world

1566
00:59:07,953 --> 00:59:10,253
(Will Hang Ho raise one more octave?)

1567
00:59:10,253 --> 00:59:15,533
(It's an explosion of high-pitched sounds.)

1568
00:59:15,533 --> 00:59:16,593
He raised it.

1569
00:59:16,593 --> 00:59:18,163
(His high tone is unexpected.)

1570
00:59:18,163 --> 00:59:19,163
That's it.

1571
00:59:19,163 --> 00:59:22,033
(Will So Min continue to raise the tone?)

1572
00:59:22,033 --> 00:59:24,843
(Her eyes widen as she sings.)

1573
00:59:24,843 --> 00:59:26,473
(Good job, So Min.)

1574
00:59:27,943 --> 00:59:32,343
(Will Na Eun raise one more octave?)

1575
00:59:32,343 --> 00:59:35,353
(She raises many octaves.)

1576
00:59:35,353 --> 00:59:40,453
(Her voice is as high as a dolphin.)

1577
00:59:41,653 --> 00:59:43,653
(Hello)

1578
00:59:43,653 --> 00:59:45,423
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

1579
00:59:45,663 --> 00:59:47,863
(Goodbye, Cleopatra)

1580
00:59:47,863 --> 00:59:49,563
(He wanted to win.)

1581
00:59:49,563 --> 00:59:50,663
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

1582
00:59:51,233 --> 00:59:52,233
Goodbye.

1583
00:59:52,233 --> 00:59:54,533
(His voice isn't high at all.)

1584
00:59:54,533 --> 00:59:56,433
- He's so unlucky. - That was good.

1585
00:59:56,733 --> 00:59:58,403
Geun Sik was cute,

1586
00:59:58,403 --> 00:59:59,743
but he's very unlucky today.

1587
01:00:00,143 --> 01:00:02,113
The order is important.

1588
01:00:02,113 --> 01:00:03,113
(The order is a factor.)

1589
01:00:03,873 --> 01:00:06,843
(They get competitive with their high tones.)

1590
01:00:06,843 --> 01:00:08,053
- Hello - Wasn't that it?

1591
01:00:10,613 --> 01:00:15,323
(Welcome to the jungle of high-pitched sounds.)

1592
01:00:16,653 --> 01:00:18,323
- Sae Ho? - Yes?

1593
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:20,063
Get ready, set, go.

1594
01:00:20,593 --> 01:00:23,863
(He makes a face.)

1595
01:00:23,863 --> 01:00:26,633
(Sae Ho barely succeeds.)

1596
01:00:26,803 --> 01:00:28,103
(Hello)

1597
01:00:28,103 --> 01:00:29,833
- Let's see. - He's eliminated.

1598
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:32,773
(Goodbye until the next mission.)

1599
01:00:32,773 --> 01:00:34,613
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

1600
01:00:34,613 --> 01:00:35,773
He's definitely eliminated.

1601
01:00:35,773 --> 01:00:37,943
You're eliminated. Have a seat.

1602
01:00:37,943 --> 01:00:39,843
(Seok Jin is eliminated.)

1603
01:00:42,213 --> 01:00:43,853
(She sings in a high tone.)

1604
01:00:43,853 --> 01:00:44,853
That sounds good.

1605
01:00:44,853 --> 01:00:47,053
(She sings in a high tone.)

1606
01:00:47,993 --> 01:00:49,623
- Jong Kook is next. - This is...

1607
01:00:49,623 --> 01:00:51,763
- too difficult. - It's too hard.

1608
01:00:51,779 --> 01:00:53,179
(Ji Hyo's tone makes him nervous.)

1609
01:00:53,669 --> 01:00:54,909
I can't do it.

1610
01:00:54,909 --> 01:00:57,209
(Men can't compete with women.)

1611
01:00:57,209 --> 01:00:59,139
I can't do it.

1612
01:00:59,139 --> 01:01:00,239
I can't.

1613
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:01,779
(He can't go any higher.)

1614
01:01:01,779 --> 01:01:02,909
Next is Hang Ho.

1615
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,549
Shall I pinch you?

1616
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:07,749
Raise my voice.

1617
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:10,289
- Shall I pinch you? - Harder, harder

1618
01:01:11,049 --> 01:01:12,159
That's right.

1619
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:13,159
(He bites him.)

1620
01:01:13,159 --> 01:01:15,389
Cleopatra

1621
01:01:15,389 --> 01:01:18,599
(His pinching is very effective.)

1622
01:01:18,699 --> 01:01:21,629
(The best potato chips in the world)

1623
01:01:21,629 --> 01:01:23,899
You made it.

1624
01:01:24,499 --> 01:01:26,039
- He made it. - You made it.

1625
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:27,569
You really made it.

1626
01:01:27,569 --> 01:01:29,269
- He did it. - You did it, Hang Ho.

1627
01:01:29,369 --> 01:01:31,009
Do it one more time.

1628
01:01:31,009 --> 01:01:32,009
So Min?

1629
01:01:34,579 --> 01:01:37,279
(Singing nonsense)

1630
01:01:37,279 --> 01:01:38,349
I can't make out the words.

1631
01:01:38,619 --> 01:01:39,649
You are eliminated.

1632
01:01:39,649 --> 01:01:42,149
(It was impossible to understand her.)

1633
01:01:43,219 --> 01:01:44,589
You were incredible.

1634
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,289
Did it hurt?

1635
01:01:46,359 --> 01:01:47,489
Na Eun.

1636
01:01:47,719 --> 01:01:48,729
Let's go.

1637
01:01:48,729 --> 01:01:51,799
(How will Na Eun do?)

1638
01:01:51,799 --> 01:01:54,229
(I can easily hit the high notes.)

1639
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:58,039
(The diva makes everyone speechless.)

1640
01:01:58,039 --> 01:02:00,799
The best potato chips in the world

1641
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:05,879
(Her voice goes beyond Yeoncheon, and moves the universe.)

1642
01:02:06,109 --> 01:02:10,009
(The universal diva's potato chip music)

1643
01:02:11,179 --> 01:02:17,489
(Sae Ho is determined to perform as well as her.)

1644
01:02:17,489 --> 01:02:20,689
(Singing nonsense)

1645
01:02:20,689 --> 01:02:22,529
(He is eliminated without a word.)

1646
01:02:22,529 --> 01:02:23,889
- I raised my voice high enough. - You are eliminated.

1647
01:02:24,029 --> 01:02:25,129
You are eliminated.

1648
01:02:25,529 --> 01:02:26,559
This is incredible.

1649
01:02:26,859 --> 01:02:28,369
This is incredible.

1650
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:30,299
We will see an end to this.

1651
01:02:30,299 --> 01:02:32,299
(The last 3 people)

1652
01:02:32,299 --> 01:02:34,439
Na Eun, Ji Hyo,

1653
01:02:34,439 --> 01:02:36,739
- and Hang Ho. - Why don't we have them sing...

1654
01:02:36,739 --> 01:02:38,879
- in the highest pitch in turns? - That's a good idea.

1655
01:02:38,979 --> 01:02:40,009
Let's begin.

1656
01:02:40,009 --> 01:02:42,479
Since all of you are very good at this,

1657
01:02:42,549 --> 01:02:45,819
you will be eliminated right away if you sing in the same pitch.

1658
01:02:46,019 --> 01:02:47,379
Hang Ho, you need to do well.

1659
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:49,219
Let's start with Ji Hyo.

1660
01:02:50,119 --> 01:02:53,019
Hello, Cleopatra

1661
01:02:53,419 --> 01:02:56,289
Hello, Cleopatra

1662
01:02:56,489 --> 01:02:59,159
Hello, Cleopatra

1663
01:02:59,659 --> 01:03:02,999
- Hello - That's wrong.

1664
01:03:02,999 --> 01:03:04,739
- You are out. - You are out.

1665
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,199
I can't do it.

1666
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,439
Ji Hyo, you are out.

1667
01:03:08,209 --> 01:03:09,809
Two people remain.

1668
01:03:10,009 --> 01:03:13,009
- Beat one more person. - Na Eun and Hang Ho.

1669
01:03:13,009 --> 01:03:14,339
- Beat Na Eun. - Two people remain.

1670
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:15,709
We need 10 dollars.

1671
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:19,519
(10 dollars and their pride are on the line.)

1672
01:03:20,879 --> 01:03:23,149
Let's start with Hang Ho. Please begin.

1673
01:03:24,049 --> 01:03:29,359
(They go back and forth.)

1674
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:32,799
(I can't back down.)

1675
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:35,399
Hello, Cleopatra

1676
01:03:36,129 --> 01:03:39,599
(Her vocal cords know no limits.)

1677
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:41,239
(Approaching)

1678
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:43,969
If you fail, you will be eliminated.

1679
01:03:43,969 --> 01:03:45,709
(Hang Ho's muse, Kwang Soo, is on standby.)

1680
01:03:46,879 --> 01:03:49,309
(A musical motif enters my mind...)

1681
01:03:49,309 --> 01:03:52,119
(now that my muse, Kwang Soo, is protecting me.)

1682
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:54,519
Hello

1683
01:03:55,249 --> 01:03:59,689
(This is the moment I hit high notes like magic.)

1684
01:03:59,689 --> 01:04:01,019
(He knows when to stop his muse.)

1685
01:04:01,019 --> 01:04:02,189
You did it.

1686
01:04:02,189 --> 01:04:04,159
- His voice went higher. - Do it one more time.

1687
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:06,259
- His voice went higher. - That's it.

1688
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,399
- His voice went higher. Na Eun. - Hang Ho.

1689
01:04:08,969 --> 01:04:10,469
You can do it, Na Eun.

1690
01:04:10,529 --> 01:04:11,739
Unleash your voice.

1691
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:15,669
(She does it again.)

1692
01:04:17,139 --> 01:04:21,039
(I can't make my voice go higher.)

1693
01:04:21,379 --> 01:04:22,379
She sounded like a dolphin.

1694
01:04:22,379 --> 01:04:24,249
- She sounded like a dolphin. - A dolphin.

1695
01:04:24,249 --> 01:04:25,449
- This is the last round. - How did she do that?

1696
01:04:25,449 --> 01:04:26,449
Hang Ho.

1697
01:04:26,449 --> 01:04:27,879
If you fail, you will be eliminated.

1698
01:04:27,879 --> 01:04:32,619
(This artist refuses to lose to a petite girl.)

1699
01:04:32,759 --> 01:04:38,129
(Both the artist and the muse want to win.)

1700
01:04:39,399 --> 01:04:42,169
(Screaming)

1701
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:44,569
(Hello, hey, Kwang Soo!)

1702
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:51,739
(Like a dolphin at the sea, Hang Ho sings of freedom.)

1703
01:04:51,739 --> 01:04:53,079
Hey, Kwang Soo!

1704
01:04:53,079 --> 01:04:54,539
(He taps out because of the pain.)

1705
01:04:54,539 --> 01:04:57,109
He sang in the same pitch. It was the same.

1706
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:00,479
- Na Eun won. - Na Eun won.

1707
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:04,289
(Na Eun wins 10 dollars.)

1708
01:05:04,389 --> 01:05:07,419
Now, Seok Jin will announce his family member's specialty.

1709
01:05:07,419 --> 01:05:08,889
I will announce his specialty.

1710
01:05:09,589 --> 01:05:12,399
My family member, Soo Yong,

1711
01:05:12,699 --> 01:05:15,569
- can't feel pain. - You are lying.

1712
01:05:15,569 --> 01:05:16,699
I am serious.

1713
01:05:16,769 --> 01:05:19,299
(Soo Yong's specialty is withstanding pain.)

1714
01:05:19,439 --> 01:05:21,569
We will test his ability to withstand pain...

1715
01:05:21,569 --> 01:05:24,039
with sideburn-pulling.

1716
01:05:24,039 --> 01:05:25,109
Sideburn-pulling.

1717
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:28,309
Why don't you stand up and have a sideburn-pulling match?

1718
01:05:28,309 --> 01:05:30,109
- Jae Seok, do you want to go first? - Shall I go first?

1719
01:05:30,109 --> 01:05:31,819
- Sure. - Will you be okay?

1720
01:05:32,149 --> 01:05:35,049
- You can't withstand pain well. - Yes, I can.

1721
01:05:35,049 --> 01:05:36,789
It's my specialty.

1722
01:05:37,089 --> 01:05:38,189
Didn't you know?

1723
01:05:38,259 --> 01:05:41,459
You look like you are in pain already.

1724
01:05:41,459 --> 01:05:42,559
I am not.

1725
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:44,999
- You should give up. - I withstand pain very well.

1726
01:05:45,099 --> 01:05:47,859
Tell them about the car accident.

1727
01:05:47,959 --> 01:05:52,399
A car that was going 40km per hour hit me once.

1728
01:05:52,399 --> 01:05:55,569
(What kind of a story will it be?)

1729
01:05:55,939 --> 01:05:57,839
- What happened? - I brushed myself off.

1730
01:05:59,239 --> 01:06:00,279
(What is he talking about?)

1731
01:06:00,279 --> 01:06:01,479
You didn't feel pain.

1732
01:06:01,479 --> 01:06:02,609
You withstood the pain.

1733
01:06:02,609 --> 01:06:06,749
(He brushed himself off, and said, "I am fine, thank you, and you?")

1734
01:06:06,979 --> 01:06:08,049
You withstood pain.

1735
01:06:08,049 --> 01:06:09,419
You should have gone...

1736
01:06:09,419 --> 01:06:11,859
- to a hospital. - The car suffered...

1737
01:06:11,859 --> 01:06:13,789
12,000 dollars' worth of damage.

1738
01:06:13,889 --> 01:06:16,129
- Soo Yong was fine. - Really?

1739
01:06:16,189 --> 01:06:19,259
I paid for the damage.

1740
01:06:19,859 --> 01:06:22,169
- You weren't like that in the past. - Did you pay for the damage?

1741
01:06:22,299 --> 01:06:24,069
You didn't feel pain.

1742
01:06:24,069 --> 01:06:26,099
I can withstand any level of pain.

1743
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:27,839
(Is the legend about Soo Yong true?)

1744
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:29,809
Get ready. Set.

1745
01:06:29,809 --> 01:06:32,409
- Go. - Beat at least five people.

1746
01:06:32,409 --> 01:06:33,439
That's right.

1747
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:38,549
(Is it true that Soo Yong can't feel pain?)

1748
01:06:38,549 --> 01:06:41,349
(Screaming)

1749
01:06:42,189 --> 01:06:43,489
He can really withstand pain.

1750
01:06:43,649 --> 01:06:44,759
It was true.

1751
01:06:45,289 --> 01:06:46,559
It was true.

1752
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:47,789
He hurt my feelings.

1753
01:06:47,789 --> 01:06:48,959
(He really doesn't feel pain.)

1754
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:50,459
His facial expression didn't change.

1755
01:06:52,029 --> 01:06:53,459
Who wants to go next?

1756
01:06:53,459 --> 01:06:54,729
Who wants to go next?

1757
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:56,699
Geun Sik will go.

1758
01:06:57,129 --> 01:06:58,739
Geun Sik can withstand pain well.

1759
01:06:58,739 --> 01:07:00,769
- He can withstand it very well. - Isn't he too strong?

1760
01:07:00,769 --> 01:07:02,709
Isn't he the one who couldn't touch your nose?

1761
01:07:03,309 --> 01:07:05,309
- He is very patient. - That's good.

1762
01:07:05,639 --> 01:07:06,839
I think he will win.

1763
01:07:06,839 --> 01:07:08,479
(It's a real match this time.)

1764
01:07:08,479 --> 01:07:11,879
(He is determined to restore his pride.)

1765
01:07:11,879 --> 01:07:13,119
I think he will win.

1766
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:17,189
Excuse me. Is this a fight?

1767
01:07:17,419 --> 01:07:18,689
(It's not a fight.)

1768
01:07:18,689 --> 01:07:20,789
- Don't do that. - This isn't a fight.

1769
01:07:20,789 --> 01:07:22,529
- Don't do that. - Make sure you pull lightly.

1770
01:07:22,529 --> 01:07:23,829
Don't lift him up by his sideburns.

1771
01:07:24,429 --> 01:07:25,599
(I don't know what pain is.)

1772
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:27,629
- Grab what you can. - It's painful.

1773
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:30,999
(The man who doesn't feel pain, Kim Soo Yong)

1774
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:33,099
Let's get 10 dollars.

1775
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:35,069
(The man with patience, Park Geun Sik)

1776
01:07:35,209 --> 01:07:37,209
10 dollars matter, Soo Yong.

1777
01:07:37,209 --> 01:07:40,809
(The two men have a showdown for their pride.)

1778
01:07:40,809 --> 01:07:41,909
Go.

1779
01:07:44,149 --> 01:07:45,249
Wait a minute.

1780
01:07:46,179 --> 01:07:48,189
I pulled out his hair. What should I do?

1781
01:07:51,289 --> 01:07:52,819
(Pulling out)

1782
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:55,089
(Soo Yong remains calm.)

1783
01:07:55,759 --> 01:07:58,629
(Flustered)

1784
01:07:59,529 --> 01:08:00,659
You pulled out his hair.

1785
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:03,069
(Soo Yong's hair sends everyone into a frenzy.)

1786
01:08:03,069 --> 01:08:04,969
What should we do? What should we do?

1787
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:08,069
- You lost. - What should we do?

1788
01:08:08,069 --> 01:08:09,609
(Soo Yong wins thanks to Geun Sik's foul play.)

1789
01:08:09,609 --> 01:08:11,439
You lost.

1790
01:08:11,439 --> 01:08:13,039
(Why do we feel bad for him even though he earned 10 dollars?)

1791
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:16,009
(The rain doesn't subside.)

1792
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:17,479
Next up are...

1793
01:08:17,479 --> 01:08:19,019
Se Chan and Na Eun.

1794
01:08:19,019 --> 01:08:20,149
Okay.

1795
01:08:20,419 --> 01:08:22,719
My wannabe family member's specialty is...

1796
01:08:22,749 --> 01:08:23,889
Drawing Quiz.

1797
01:08:24,589 --> 01:08:27,459
(Na Eun's specialty is Drawing Quiz.)

1798
01:08:27,619 --> 01:08:30,259
We will test Na Eun's skills...

1799
01:08:30,329 --> 01:08:33,459
by playing Drawing Quiz within the time limit of 100 seconds.

1800
01:08:33,459 --> 01:08:36,069
The team that gets the most number of answers will win.

1801
01:08:36,199 --> 01:08:37,329
- Okay. - All right.

1802
01:08:37,329 --> 01:08:38,739
They will go first.

1803
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,739
I will pick a theme.

1804
01:08:41,339 --> 01:08:42,869
Let's take a look. What did you pick, Na Eun?

1805
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:44,439
(The theme is profession.)

1806
01:08:44,439 --> 01:08:45,739
- Number 7. - Number 7.

1807
01:08:48,209 --> 01:08:50,649
- Get ready. - Let's go, Na Eun.

1808
01:08:51,009 --> 01:08:52,119
Set,

1809
01:08:52,949 --> 01:08:53,949
go.

1810
01:08:53,949 --> 01:08:56,719
(Nurse)

1811
01:08:58,489 --> 01:09:01,559
(She draws without hesitation.)

1812
01:09:01,559 --> 01:09:02,959
Doctor. Nurse.

1813
01:09:02,959 --> 01:09:04,129
Correct.

1814
01:09:04,129 --> 01:09:05,799
All right.

1815
01:09:05,799 --> 01:09:08,829
She draws the most important things.

1816
01:09:08,829 --> 01:09:09,829
Baseball player.

1817
01:09:09,829 --> 01:09:10,969
- Correct. - Baseball player.

1818
01:09:10,969 --> 01:09:12,169
- She is good. - I can see it from here.

1819
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:15,039
(He gets the answers right away.)

1820
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:17,009
- Basketball player. - Correct.

1821
01:09:17,239 --> 01:09:18,409
She draws very quickly.

1822
01:09:19,109 --> 01:09:20,939
She can draw very well.

1823
01:09:20,939 --> 01:09:22,509
(Na Eun's drawings are simple and straightforward.)

1824
01:09:22,509 --> 01:09:23,949
- Teacher. - Good.

1825
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:25,779
Time's up.

1826
01:09:25,779 --> 01:09:27,119
(100 seconds are up.)

1827
01:09:27,379 --> 01:09:31,759
(Se Chan and Na Eun get 4 questions right.)

1828
01:09:33,459 --> 01:09:34,859
We didn't win once.

1829
01:09:35,729 --> 01:09:36,759
I will do my best.

1830
01:09:36,759 --> 01:09:37,959
(Let's win this time.)

1831
01:09:37,959 --> 01:09:39,529
- We lost so many times. - Number one.

1832
01:09:39,529 --> 01:09:41,869
- Get ready. - What's the theme?

1833
01:09:41,869 --> 01:09:43,899
The theme is proverbs.

1834
01:09:43,899 --> 01:09:46,099
- What? - Proverbs are hard.

1835
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:49,239
(Why does it have to be proverbs?)

1836
01:09:49,239 --> 01:09:51,609
(Will they be able to draw the proverbs?)

1837
01:09:51,609 --> 01:09:53,309
Set. Go.

1838
01:09:53,639 --> 01:09:55,349
(He who steals a needle will steal an ox.)

1839
01:09:55,349 --> 01:09:59,019
(He who steals a needle will steal an ox.)

1840
01:10:00,249 --> 01:10:03,819
(Look at the needle.)

1841
01:10:04,489 --> 01:10:05,519
A needle...

1842
01:10:06,959 --> 01:10:07,959
A needle...

1843
01:10:07,959 --> 01:10:10,929
(Yes, it's a needle. Give me the answer.)

1844
01:10:10,929 --> 01:10:12,299
"A needle makes a treasure."

1845
01:10:12,299 --> 01:10:13,329
(He is confident.)

1846
01:10:17,269 --> 01:10:21,639
(He combines different proverbs.)

1847
01:10:21,639 --> 01:10:22,739
Isn't it "beads"?

1848
01:10:23,009 --> 01:10:24,409
"A needle makes a treasure."

1849
01:10:24,409 --> 01:10:26,239
(There is a similar proverb.)

1850
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:27,479
Isn't it "beads"?

1851
01:10:27,909 --> 01:10:29,009
"Beads make a treasure."

1852
01:10:29,009 --> 01:10:30,049
Move onto the next question.

1853
01:10:30,749 --> 01:10:32,479
What a fool! I am sorry.

1854
01:10:32,849 --> 01:10:34,519
For goodness' sake.

1855
01:10:35,049 --> 01:10:36,049
It is about a needle.

1856
01:10:36,549 --> 01:10:38,259
"It's hard to go through the eye of a needle."

1857
01:10:38,259 --> 01:10:39,719
(I think this one is the answer.)

1858
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:43,129
(It's hard to go through the eye of a needle.)

1859
01:10:43,129 --> 01:10:44,129
(It's hard indeed.)

1860
01:10:44,129 --> 01:10:45,259
This is hilarious.

1861
01:10:45,729 --> 01:10:47,229
- Pass. - Pass.

1862
01:10:47,429 --> 01:10:48,499
Here comes the next one.

1863
01:10:48,569 --> 01:10:50,069
This is driving me crazy.

1864
01:10:50,069 --> 01:10:51,169
(Birds listen during the day, and mice listen during the night.)

1865
01:10:52,099 --> 01:10:53,399
This is hilarious.

1866
01:10:53,399 --> 01:10:55,439
(Birds listen during the day, and mice listen during the night.)

1867
01:10:55,439 --> 01:10:57,009
You are doing well.

1868
01:10:57,139 --> 01:10:59,479
Shout out your guesses. Don't sit still.

1869
01:10:59,479 --> 01:11:00,509
(This proverb is easy to draw.)

1870
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:03,309
He will get this one right.

1871
01:11:03,579 --> 01:11:06,379
Mice listen during the day, and birds listen during the night.

1872
01:11:07,749 --> 01:11:10,219
(He switches the subjects.)

1873
01:11:10,219 --> 01:11:11,289
My goodness.

1874
01:11:13,759 --> 01:11:14,989
Please be quiet.

1875
01:11:14,989 --> 01:11:19,199
(You are almost there. Just switch the subjects.)

1876
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:22,829
(Birds come out during the day.)

1877
01:11:24,569 --> 01:11:26,399
(I get it.)

1878
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:27,499
The sun and a bird.

1879
01:11:27,499 --> 01:11:30,539
(The sun and a bird)

1880
01:11:30,539 --> 01:11:35,079
(The sun and a bird?)

1881
01:11:35,609 --> 01:11:37,279
(It is a sun and a bird indeed.)

1882
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:39,219
Pass. Just move on.

1883
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:40,519
- Pass. - Pass it.

1884
01:11:40,779 --> 01:11:43,019
Pass. It's not a sun and a bird.

1885
01:11:43,019 --> 01:11:44,449
(Geun Sik makes up a new proverb.)

1886
01:11:45,219 --> 01:11:46,389
There.

1887
01:11:46,819 --> 01:11:47,859
Go ahead.

1888
01:11:48,089 --> 01:11:50,059
It's not a sun and a bird.

1889
01:11:50,059 --> 01:11:51,629
He's awesome.

1890
01:11:51,629 --> 01:11:53,899
Go. Good.

1891
01:11:54,099 --> 01:11:55,599
Share every last bit.

1892
01:11:56,669 --> 01:11:57,669
That's not it.

1893
01:11:57,669 --> 01:11:59,399
"Share every last bit."

1894
01:11:59,869 --> 01:12:00,869
Why?

1895
01:12:02,639 --> 01:12:04,469
(You spray it on the rice.)

1896
01:12:04,469 --> 01:12:05,809
The rice...

1897
01:12:07,079 --> 01:12:08,579
The rice...

1898
01:12:08,579 --> 01:12:10,309
(He got it.)

1899
01:12:10,309 --> 01:12:12,349
(You rain...)

1900
01:12:12,349 --> 01:12:13,749
Seasoning with rice.

1901
01:12:17,819 --> 01:12:20,059
(What on earth are you talking about?)

1902
01:12:21,989 --> 01:12:26,729
(Geun Sik thinks the seasoning goes great with rice.)

1903
01:12:26,729 --> 01:12:27,899
Go back.

1904
01:12:27,899 --> 01:12:29,999
- I... - Seasoning...

1905
01:12:29,999 --> 01:12:31,799
- I don't know any proverbs. - It's all right.

1906
01:12:32,069 --> 01:12:33,769
I don't know any.

1907
01:12:33,899 --> 01:12:34,969
We can do this.

1908
01:12:35,039 --> 01:12:36,139
We can do this.

1909
01:12:39,409 --> 01:12:42,279
(It looks like legs and arms.)

1910
01:12:43,849 --> 01:12:46,479
I don't know what this is. A dining table?

1911
01:12:48,089 --> 01:12:49,489
He loves eating, doesn't he?

1912
01:12:49,849 --> 01:12:51,149
Is he hungry?

1913
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:52,519
He loves to eat.

1914
01:12:53,459 --> 01:12:55,459
Those are legs.

1915
01:12:55,959 --> 01:12:57,159
Say it.

1916
01:12:58,199 --> 01:13:00,999
Don't put your legs on the table.

1917
01:13:01,399 --> 01:13:03,499
What's that?

1918
01:13:03,499 --> 01:13:06,199
(He gives a life lesson instead of guessing a proverb.)

1919
01:13:07,169 --> 01:13:08,239
That's it.

1920
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:11,479
(Haha and Geun Sik run out of time.)

1921
01:13:11,739 --> 01:13:14,409
- Geun Sik. - Today,

1922
01:13:14,409 --> 01:13:16,749
he mentioned the sun and the bird...

1923
01:13:17,079 --> 01:13:18,719
and seasoning with rice.

1924
01:13:19,149 --> 01:13:20,519
Give them a round of applause.

1925
01:13:21,149 --> 01:13:23,389
(Geun Sik is eternally respected.)

1926
01:13:23,389 --> 01:13:25,459
- He's a nice guy. - He's very nice.

1927
01:13:25,459 --> 01:13:27,589
- He's an angel. - He really is.

1928
01:13:28,629 --> 01:13:30,359
- There are only movies left. - These are movies.

1929
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:31,629
Really? Movies?

1930
01:13:31,629 --> 01:13:32,759
- Movies? - Yes.

1931
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:34,499
Ready. Go.

1932
01:13:35,569 --> 01:13:38,599
("Spider Man")

1933
01:13:40,139 --> 01:13:41,469
This one's relatively easy.

1934
01:13:42,809 --> 01:13:44,739
It's easy.

1935
01:13:44,739 --> 01:13:45,939
(It's easy if you draw the right things.)

1936
01:13:45,939 --> 01:13:47,009
What is that?

1937
01:13:47,639 --> 01:13:50,109
Sae Ho is very bad at drawing.

1938
01:13:50,249 --> 01:13:51,879
Look at his drawing.

1939
01:13:51,879 --> 01:13:53,679
What's that? A waffle?

1940
01:13:53,849 --> 01:13:55,049
It looks delicious.

1941
01:13:55,049 --> 01:13:56,319
No?

1942
01:13:56,319 --> 01:13:57,819
(Why don't you get this?)

1943
01:13:57,819 --> 01:13:59,559
- Please be quiet. - Pass.

1944
01:13:59,559 --> 01:14:00,789
- What? - Why don't you get this?

1945
01:14:00,789 --> 01:14:02,229
- I don't know. - How can you not get this?

1946
01:14:02,529 --> 01:14:04,189
Pass. Why don't you get it?

1947
01:14:04,389 --> 01:14:05,529
I don't know.

1948
01:14:06,199 --> 01:14:08,869
(The next question is...)

1949
01:14:08,869 --> 01:14:10,229
- "The Little Mermaid". - This one is hard.

1950
01:14:10,229 --> 01:14:12,969
(What's the next question?)

1951
01:14:15,609 --> 01:14:16,869
It's scary.

1952
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,209
It is.

1953
01:14:18,209 --> 01:14:19,639
(It's scary.)

1954
01:14:19,879 --> 01:14:20,909
(What's that? A horror movie?)

1955
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:23,849
I made eye contact with it.

1956
01:14:24,849 --> 01:14:27,419
(The Beauty looks very troubled.)

1957
01:14:27,879 --> 01:14:29,519
- "Hellraiser". - I made eye contacts with it too.

1958
01:14:30,249 --> 01:14:31,319
- Pass. - "Hellraiser".

1959
01:14:31,319 --> 01:14:33,289
- You don't know this? - What are you doing?

1960
01:14:33,859 --> 01:14:35,789
- Hurry. - Does one team...

1961
01:14:35,789 --> 01:14:36,889
Hurry, Sae Ho.

1962
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:38,659
- What's that? - What is that?

1963
01:14:38,659 --> 01:14:40,099
(What's this now?)

1964
01:14:40,099 --> 01:14:42,129
(You haven't seen this before, right?)

1965
01:14:42,129 --> 01:14:43,769
I made eye contact with it again.

1966
01:14:44,029 --> 01:14:45,269
Please.

1967
01:14:45,269 --> 01:14:46,769
(What is that ugly thing?)

1968
01:14:47,169 --> 01:14:48,209
Please.

1969
01:14:48,209 --> 01:14:49,409
It keeps on glaring at me.

1970
01:14:49,769 --> 01:14:51,579
- Turn it around. - It's glaring at me.

1971
01:14:51,579 --> 01:14:52,979
Don't make it scary.

1972
01:14:53,109 --> 01:14:54,409
Make it look happier.

1973
01:14:57,109 --> 01:14:59,319
(Sae Ho doesn't get why Jae Seok is not getting it.)

1974
01:14:59,319 --> 01:15:00,949
Pass. Why doesn't he know this?

1975
01:15:00,949 --> 01:15:02,489
("The Man from Nowhere")

1976
01:15:02,489 --> 01:15:03,749
Hurry, Sae Ho.

1977
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:06,159
You don't have to be so detailed.

1978
01:15:06,489 --> 01:15:07,589
Sae Ho...

1979
01:15:08,289 --> 01:15:09,559
- What's that? - What is that?

1980
01:15:09,559 --> 01:15:10,559
What's this?

1981
01:15:10,559 --> 01:15:11,959
(He keeps on drawing ugly pictures.)

1982
01:15:11,959 --> 01:15:13,629
What are you doing?

1983
01:15:13,799 --> 01:15:14,799
That's...

1984
01:15:15,029 --> 01:15:16,969
- What's that? - Pass.

1985
01:15:16,969 --> 01:15:18,069
(They didn't get anything right before running out of time.)

1986
01:15:18,069 --> 01:15:19,439
What's this?

1987
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:21,869
- What movie was that? - It was "The Man from Nowhere".

1988
01:15:23,809 --> 01:15:26,109
- Wait. - Wait. How's this the same movie?

1989
01:15:26,109 --> 01:15:27,839
Don't you know the scene...

1990
01:15:28,009 --> 01:15:29,079
where Won Bin was sick?

1991
01:15:29,509 --> 01:15:32,149
(Don't you know the scene where Won Bin was sick?)

1992
01:15:32,149 --> 01:15:33,219
(They don't look alike at all.)

1993
01:15:35,319 --> 01:15:36,889
You should have drawn the hair trimmer.

1994
01:15:36,889 --> 01:15:39,319
You were supposed to draw the hair trimmer.

1995
01:15:39,319 --> 01:15:40,659
Look at what he drew before that.

1996
01:15:40,659 --> 01:15:42,159
- What's this? - Try to guess.

1997
01:15:42,489 --> 01:15:43,989
- It's easy. - What's this?

1998
01:15:44,529 --> 01:15:46,099
It's obviously "200 Pound Beauty".

1999
01:15:46,099 --> 01:15:48,969
(He's so confident.)

2000
01:15:49,729 --> 01:15:51,669
- It's obvious. - I guess that's Kim A Joong.

2001
01:15:51,669 --> 01:15:53,199
(She looks like she's in a lot of pain.)

2002
01:15:53,969 --> 01:15:55,269
If I drew it, you would have gotten it right away.

2003
01:15:55,269 --> 01:15:56,669
Try drawing this then.

2004
01:15:56,669 --> 01:15:58,579
This is easy.

2005
01:15:58,579 --> 01:16:00,079
You don't need to take your time with it.

2006
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:03,249
- It's "200 Pound Beauty". - My gosh.

2007
01:16:03,249 --> 01:16:04,249
"200 Pound Beauty".

2008
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:08,349
(It looks exactly like "200 Pound Beauty".)

2009
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,019
I think it's "200 Pound Beauty".

2010
01:16:10,019 --> 01:16:11,489
That's "200 Pound Beauty".

2011
01:16:11,489 --> 01:16:12,489
("200 Pound Beauty")

2012
01:16:12,489 --> 01:16:14,359
- "200 Pound Beauty". - I'll guess. "200 Pound Beauty".

2013
01:16:15,089 --> 01:16:16,189
- What about "Ju-On"? - What?

2014
01:16:16,189 --> 01:16:18,829
That one's too easy.

2015
01:16:18,829 --> 01:16:20,659
- You need somebody crying. - It's scary.

2016
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:21,869
("Ju-On" doesn't take much effort.)

2017
01:16:21,969 --> 01:16:23,199
It's Toshio.

2018
01:16:24,029 --> 01:16:26,199
- That looks like "Ju-On". - Exactly.

2019
01:16:26,539 --> 01:16:28,539
(It's like looking at a poster.)

2020
01:16:29,369 --> 01:16:32,039
(I guess this is how you draw.)

2021
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:33,709
I'm sorry then.

2022
01:16:36,679 --> 01:16:37,679
(You're supposed to draw like me.)

2023
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:38,849
- I should have drawn. - I'm sorry.

2024
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:40,079
It's all right, Sae Ho.

2025
01:16:40,419 --> 01:16:42,049
Too bad.

2026
01:16:42,049 --> 01:16:44,619
(Se Chan and Na Eun win 10 dollars.)

2027
01:16:44,989 --> 01:16:47,959
This time, let's go with Ji Hyo's family.

2028
01:16:47,959 --> 01:16:49,059
Sung Moon.

2029
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:51,029
Sung Moon says...

2030
01:16:51,029 --> 01:16:53,259
he's good at kicking.

2031
01:16:53,259 --> 01:16:55,099
- Kicking? - Yes, I...

2032
01:16:55,529 --> 01:16:57,599
- Kicking? - Did you play soccer?

2033
01:16:57,599 --> 01:16:58,969
- He was a soccer player. - He was.

2034
01:16:58,969 --> 01:17:00,539
He went abroad for it.

2035
01:17:01,139 --> 01:17:04,009
(Sung Moon is number 1 in kicking.)

2036
01:17:04,469 --> 01:17:06,639
- The machine. - I know this one.

2037
01:17:06,639 --> 01:17:07,679
(It's a soccer game.)

2038
01:17:08,179 --> 01:17:09,749
There's a machine for this.

2039
01:17:09,749 --> 01:17:10,749
(The person with the highest score wins.)

2040
01:17:11,549 --> 01:17:14,049
- Let's see Sung Moon first. - Sure.

2041
01:17:14,049 --> 01:17:16,789
- He's different from amateurs. - Exactly.

2042
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:18,759
Let's go, Sung Moon.

2043
01:17:19,219 --> 01:17:20,689
I bet he's good.

2044
01:17:20,959 --> 01:17:21,959
Ready.

2045
01:17:22,889 --> 01:17:25,029
- Sung Moon. - Let's go.

2046
01:17:28,529 --> 01:17:30,999
(4 months ago in Mapo-gu)

2047
01:17:30,999 --> 01:17:34,869
(He kicked his sister on the streets.)

2048
01:17:34,869 --> 01:17:37,909
(You have to do the same, brother.)

2049
01:17:38,679 --> 01:17:40,709
Set. Go.

2050
01:17:40,709 --> 01:17:42,549
(He only gets one chance.)

2051
01:17:42,549 --> 01:17:47,049
(He gathers up every ounce of energy he has.)

2052
01:17:50,449 --> 01:17:53,359
(It's a powerful kick.)

2053
01:17:55,689 --> 01:17:57,289
(The score keeps on going up.)

2054
01:17:57,289 --> 01:17:59,129
- My goodness. - That was amazing.

2055
01:17:59,129 --> 01:18:04,669
(What's his score?)

2056
01:18:04,669 --> 01:18:05,699
He broke the record.

2057
01:18:05,699 --> 01:18:06,699
(It's the best score.)

2058
01:18:07,639 --> 01:18:09,539
This is the best score on the machine.

2059
01:18:09,539 --> 01:18:12,139
- He kicked it well. - It's the best score.

2060
01:18:12,139 --> 01:18:13,709
He got 605 points.

2061
01:18:13,709 --> 01:18:14,779
(Sung Moon gets 605 points.)

2062
01:18:16,279 --> 01:18:17,779
Who would like to try?

2063
01:18:18,519 --> 01:18:20,949
- Jong Kook would. - Let's see how good he is.

2064
01:18:21,349 --> 01:18:24,149
(He doesn't look like an easy opponent.)

2065
01:18:24,249 --> 01:18:25,419
His phone dropped.

2066
01:18:26,919 --> 01:18:28,329
He's getting excited.

2067
01:18:28,389 --> 01:18:29,629
Like this.

2068
01:18:29,629 --> 01:18:31,059
(If you get kicked by him, you'll die.)

2069
01:18:31,059 --> 01:18:34,599
All right. He plays recreational soccer a lot.

2070
01:18:34,599 --> 01:18:36,399
- You've played a lot. - Right.

2071
01:18:36,399 --> 01:18:37,599
He's not good, but he loves it.

2072
01:18:37,599 --> 01:18:39,239
I'll do this.

2073
01:18:39,239 --> 01:18:40,799
- Be careful. - Okay.

2074
01:18:40,969 --> 01:18:42,639
- You never know. - I'll give it a try.

2075
01:18:42,639 --> 01:18:43,909
(He looks very threatening.)

2076
01:18:43,909 --> 01:18:49,909
(Will he get a higher score than Sung Moon?)

2077
01:18:53,919 --> 01:18:56,919
(He kicks it.)

2078
01:18:58,259 --> 01:18:59,759
He's going to break the machine.

2079
01:19:01,289 --> 01:19:02,859
(They are in awe.)

2080
01:19:02,859 --> 01:19:03,859
He's strong.

2081
01:19:03,859 --> 01:19:05,329
My body didn't go forward.

2082
01:19:05,329 --> 01:19:09,569
It should have. My body didn't go forward.

2083
01:19:10,199 --> 01:19:13,669
(Sung Moon is currently in 1st place.)

2084
01:19:13,669 --> 01:19:18,139
(Will he be able to keep his spot?)

2085
01:19:18,139 --> 01:19:20,379
I should have gone forward.

2086
01:19:20,639 --> 01:19:23,909
(Jong Kook gets 595 points. He doesn't beat Sung Moon.)

2087
01:19:24,819 --> 01:19:27,419
Sung Moon won.

2088
01:19:27,419 --> 01:19:31,619
If you can't get past 605 points, Sung Moon and his sister...

2089
01:19:31,619 --> 01:19:34,589
will take 10 dollars. Who'd like to try next?

2090
01:19:35,859 --> 01:19:37,859
(I'll break the record.)

2091
01:19:37,859 --> 01:19:40,159
It's finally Wook Min's turn.

2092
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:41,599
He's strong.

2093
01:19:41,599 --> 01:19:43,469
- I... - I have a feeling he'll win.

2094
01:19:44,529 --> 01:19:46,839
- I had surgery on my right leg. - What?

2095
01:19:46,839 --> 01:19:48,809
- I had surgery on my right leg. - Can you use your left leg?

2096
01:19:48,809 --> 01:19:50,139
- I will. - Be careful.

2097
01:19:50,139 --> 01:19:51,739
- I will use my left leg. - Sure.

2098
01:19:51,739 --> 01:19:53,579
- Do you play soccer? - No.

2099
01:19:53,579 --> 01:19:54,649
- You don't? - No.

2100
01:19:54,649 --> 01:19:56,909
- By the way, he's very handsome. - He is.

2101
01:19:56,909 --> 01:19:59,049
I think he's the most handsome out of everybody here.

2102
01:20:00,679 --> 01:20:02,749
He looks better than celebrities.

2103
01:20:02,849 --> 01:20:04,759
I feel kind of...

2104
01:20:04,759 --> 01:20:06,259
sad about it.

2105
01:20:06,259 --> 01:20:08,489
He's the most handsome here.

2106
01:20:08,489 --> 01:20:09,489
I mean it.

2107
01:20:09,489 --> 01:20:10,959
He's the best one here.

2108
01:20:12,329 --> 01:20:13,859
- I feel like his left is strong. - Can I go?

2109
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:16,099
- Let's get that 10 dollars. - 10 dollars?

2110
01:20:17,099 --> 01:20:18,369
- You like money. - Please go ahead.

2111
01:20:21,439 --> 01:20:26,939
(Would his leg muscles be as good as his face?)

2112
01:20:28,249 --> 01:20:30,379
(Kicking)

2113
01:20:34,449 --> 01:20:36,419
(He smashes it with his left leg.)

2114
01:20:36,419 --> 01:20:37,889
That was good.

2115
01:20:37,889 --> 01:20:39,019
He went over.

2116
01:20:39,019 --> 01:20:40,019
He did.

2117
01:20:40,019 --> 01:20:47,899
(Would it be higher than 605 points?)

2118
01:20:47,899 --> 01:20:50,269
(Wook Min gets 641 points.)

2119
01:20:50,269 --> 01:20:55,609
(He's in 1st place.)

2120
01:20:56,509 --> 01:20:57,809
It's his left leg.

2121
01:20:57,809 --> 01:21:00,539
(He got such a high score with his left leg.)

2122
01:21:00,539 --> 01:21:02,749
- I'm right-footed. - And he even used his left foot.

2123
01:21:03,049 --> 01:21:04,679
This is unbelievable.

2124
01:21:04,979 --> 01:21:06,749
He put his weight on it.

2125
01:21:06,749 --> 01:21:07,949
(He's currently on top.)

2126
01:21:08,119 --> 01:21:11,149
The Black Shadow Geun Sik is next.

2127
01:21:11,149 --> 01:21:12,589
I think you can do it.

2128
01:21:13,159 --> 01:21:14,829
- You can. - Geun Sik.

2129
01:21:14,829 --> 01:21:16,559
- Can you pull up your pants? - No.

2130
01:21:16,559 --> 01:21:20,529
Up to now, he's... Wait.

2131
01:21:20,829 --> 01:21:23,129
(Hey, hold on.)

2132
01:21:23,969 --> 01:21:26,739
- That's it. - What's wrong?

2133
01:21:26,969 --> 01:21:29,039
- Wasn't I supposed to kick? - It's high.

2134
01:21:29,039 --> 01:21:31,339
- Go again. - Listen to him first.

2135
01:21:31,339 --> 01:21:33,879
- You don't play soccer, do you? - No.

2136
01:21:33,879 --> 01:21:36,509
- I've never played soccer. - All right.

2137
01:21:36,749 --> 01:21:38,519
Are you feeling confident?

2138
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:40,479
- This is my first time. - Really?

2139
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:42,289
He's never used this machine before,

2140
01:21:42,349 --> 01:21:45,059
but within our group of friends,

2141
01:21:45,059 --> 01:21:46,719
- he's the king of foot volleyball. - Is that right?

2142
01:21:47,259 --> 01:21:48,559
His nickname is Foot Volleyball.

2143
01:21:49,429 --> 01:21:50,429
Because he's good at it?

2144
01:21:50,629 --> 01:21:52,259
He's really good. I'm serious.

2145
01:21:52,259 --> 01:21:54,129
- Are you Park Foot Volleyball? - Yes, that's me.

2146
01:21:54,129 --> 01:21:55,329
- All right. - It looks good.

2147
01:21:55,529 --> 01:21:58,869
Be serious. Hey, let's make this one look cool.

2148
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:06,339
(He bets his name on it.)

2149
01:22:06,379 --> 01:22:07,639
(He's going for it!)

2150
01:22:07,639 --> 01:22:10,349
(Roaring)

2151
01:22:11,619 --> 01:22:14,689
(What's his score?)

2152
01:22:14,689 --> 01:22:16,119
- It was good. - His weight wasn't on it.

2153
01:22:16,119 --> 01:22:18,859
- It wasn't. - Same here.

2154
01:22:18,859 --> 01:22:19,859
Too bad.

2155
01:22:21,429 --> 01:22:22,789
You aren't good.

2156
01:22:22,789 --> 01:22:25,259
(He gets 590 points.)

2157
01:22:25,259 --> 01:22:26,499
(It looked cool, but he doesn't get 1st place.)

2158
01:22:26,499 --> 01:22:27,529
So...

2159
01:22:27,529 --> 01:22:28,599
(It looked cool, but he doesn't get 1st place.)

2160
01:22:30,299 --> 01:22:32,339
- So... - You're so sexy.

2161
01:22:32,339 --> 01:22:33,539
Thank you.

2162
01:22:33,569 --> 01:22:35,639
He's very sexy today.

2163
01:22:35,639 --> 01:22:36,739
I agree.

2164
01:22:36,739 --> 01:22:39,539
Wook Min is starting to show off now.

2165
01:22:39,539 --> 01:22:41,309
"I even kicked with my left foot."

2166
01:22:41,309 --> 01:22:42,979
(He copies Wook Min.)

2167
01:22:42,979 --> 01:22:45,149
"I got surgery on my right leg."

2168
01:22:45,149 --> 01:22:46,849
He kept on showing off.

2169
01:22:46,849 --> 01:22:48,789
- It was good before that. - He says things like that.

2170
01:22:48,789 --> 01:22:50,689
He's the best right now.

2171
01:22:50,689 --> 01:22:51,689
(Today's guests are competitive.)

2172
01:22:51,689 --> 01:22:53,659
- This... - It isn't easy.

2173
01:22:54,059 --> 01:22:56,329
- This isn't easy to beat. - I don't know how to feel about it.

2174
01:22:56,329 --> 01:22:59,129
Next is So Min's family.

2175
01:22:59,229 --> 01:23:01,469
- My brother is good at... - What is it?

2176
01:23:01,469 --> 01:23:02,929
arm wrestling.

2177
01:23:03,629 --> 01:23:06,239
(Wook Min is number 1 in arm wrestling.)

2178
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:08,169
(He looks like he's good.)

2179
01:23:08,169 --> 01:23:09,969
He looks like he's really good.

2180
01:23:10,509 --> 01:23:12,039
Let's not try.

2181
01:23:12,039 --> 01:23:14,309
Hang Ho's never lost in arm wrestling.

2182
01:23:14,309 --> 01:23:15,609
Really?

2183
01:23:15,609 --> 01:23:17,149
I'm right.

2184
01:23:17,149 --> 01:23:18,849
It's because I've never done it before.

2185
01:23:18,849 --> 01:23:20,649
I'm serious. He won't show off.

2186
01:23:20,649 --> 01:23:22,549
- He's just modest. - I'm not.

2187
01:23:22,549 --> 01:23:25,019
Sae Ho has a family of strong men too.

2188
01:23:25,019 --> 01:23:26,559
- My family? - Yes.

2189
01:23:26,619 --> 01:23:28,089
- My family has strong men? - Yes.

2190
01:23:28,229 --> 01:23:32,059
His family is. It runs in his family.

2191
01:23:32,059 --> 01:23:33,259
How did you know that?

2192
01:23:33,259 --> 01:23:35,429
Geun Sik is confident about this one.

2193
01:23:35,529 --> 01:23:37,799
- He's strong too. - He is.

2194
01:23:37,799 --> 01:23:40,639
Should we do a tournament within the group?

2195
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:42,539
- We should. - That would be better.

2196
01:23:42,539 --> 01:23:44,309
Wook Min hurt his right hand, so he'll use his left.

2197
01:23:44,309 --> 01:23:45,439
- His left? - Yes.

2198
01:23:45,439 --> 01:23:46,639
- Then, - It's okay.

2199
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:48,349
use your left hand in the final round.

2200
01:23:48,849 --> 01:23:52,049
For the preliminary, use whatever hand you prefer.

2201
01:23:52,049 --> 01:23:53,379
It's okay.

2202
01:23:54,249 --> 01:23:55,849
Let's do this, Geun Sik.

2203
01:23:55,849 --> 01:23:58,559
- I'm not sure. - I'm certain.

2204
01:23:58,659 --> 01:23:59,919
I can't.

2205
01:24:00,859 --> 01:24:03,389
Let's start the first round.

2206
01:24:03,389 --> 01:24:06,599
It's between Se Chan and Soo Yong.

2207
01:24:06,599 --> 01:24:08,329
(It's between Soo Yong and Se Chan.)

2208
01:24:08,329 --> 01:24:09,329
Go, Se Chan.

2209
01:24:10,029 --> 01:24:11,469
I'm bad at arm wrestling.

2210
01:24:11,769 --> 01:24:13,439
- Ready. - He has a big hand.

2211
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:14,669
Look at him.

2212
01:24:15,069 --> 01:24:16,339
Ready.

2213
01:24:16,339 --> 01:24:17,739
Se Chan is pretty strong.

2214
01:24:17,739 --> 01:24:19,209
It might be a surprise.

2215
01:24:19,509 --> 01:24:20,539
- Se Chan is strong. - This is a preliminary.

2216
01:24:20,539 --> 01:24:21,879
He's too strong.

2217
01:24:21,879 --> 01:24:22,879
Ready.

2218
01:24:23,309 --> 01:24:25,179
You have to win, Soo Yong.

2219
01:24:26,649 --> 01:24:29,619
(Who will be the winner?)

2220
01:24:30,249 --> 01:24:31,489
Set. Go.

2221
01:24:32,959 --> 01:24:33,989
Se Chan wins.

2222
01:24:34,189 --> 01:24:37,389
(He wins right away.)

2223
01:24:39,499 --> 01:24:41,329
(She's impressed.)

2224
01:24:43,869 --> 01:24:45,369
- He's strong. - Look at Soo Yong.

2225
01:24:45,369 --> 01:24:48,469
Next... Na Eun is across from you.

2226
01:24:48,939 --> 01:24:51,839
He's much stronger with her across from him.

2227
01:24:51,839 --> 01:24:53,309
Am I doing okay, Na Eun?

2228
01:24:54,009 --> 01:24:56,509
(I can keep winning for you.)

2229
01:24:57,649 --> 01:25:00,849
Next is Hang Ho and Sae Ho.

2230
01:25:02,149 --> 01:25:05,119
As I mentioned, he has a family of strong men.

2231
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:07,159
Hang Ho has never lost before.

2232
01:25:07,159 --> 01:25:08,429
- Really? - Yes.

2233
01:25:08,529 --> 01:25:09,859
All right. Ready.

2234
01:25:09,859 --> 01:25:10,859
(It's a legendary match up.)

2235
01:25:11,529 --> 01:25:12,529
Good.

2236
01:25:12,859 --> 01:25:15,529
- Look at his grip. It's different. - Ready.

2237
01:25:15,529 --> 01:25:16,529
Set.

2238
01:25:17,169 --> 01:25:18,169
Set...

2239
01:25:19,969 --> 01:25:22,209
(Hang Ho has never lost before,)

2240
01:25:23,169 --> 01:25:25,109
(and Sae Ho is from a family of strong men.)

2241
01:25:26,139 --> 01:25:27,239
(Who will win?)

2242
01:25:27,239 --> 01:25:28,249
Go.

2243
01:25:30,249 --> 01:25:31,579
Go.

2244
01:25:33,519 --> 01:25:35,889
(That was quick.)

2245
01:25:35,889 --> 01:25:38,619
(Who's the winner?)

2246
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:40,389
He's so strong.

2247
01:25:40,389 --> 01:25:41,889
I thought you won.

2248
01:25:42,559 --> 01:25:44,029
It sounded like you won.

2249
01:25:44,029 --> 01:25:45,329
Is it over?

2250
01:25:45,329 --> 01:25:46,459
(Is this really over?)

2251
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:49,329
Set. Go.

2252
01:25:49,329 --> 01:25:50,329
(Shouting)

2253
01:25:51,439 --> 01:25:53,499
(It ends in 1 second.)

2254
01:25:54,539 --> 01:25:56,339
I don't think the match started yet.

2255
01:25:56,339 --> 01:26:00,209
It's between Sung Moon and Geun Sik.

2256
01:26:00,879 --> 01:26:03,509
He's got the strongest bones in Mapo-gu.

2257
01:26:03,509 --> 01:26:05,819
- Is that right? - He has strong bones.

2258
01:26:06,049 --> 01:26:07,749
- Ready. - Would you be all right?

2259
01:26:07,749 --> 01:26:09,649
Sung Moon is an athlete.

2260
01:26:09,649 --> 01:26:11,119
- He used to be. - Ready.

2261
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:12,259
Let's cheer for them.

2262
01:26:13,259 --> 01:26:14,959
Let's go.

2263
01:26:14,959 --> 01:26:15,959
(It's between the soccer player and the king of foot volleyball.)

2264
01:26:18,329 --> 01:26:20,359
- Ready. - It'll be great if Sung Moon wins.

2265
01:26:20,359 --> 01:26:22,529
(Will it be Sung Moon in his 20s...)

2266
01:26:23,369 --> 01:26:26,069
(or the invincible Geun Sik?)

2267
01:26:26,069 --> 01:26:29,839
(What will be the result of the 3rd match?)

2268
01:26:31,139 --> 01:26:32,139
Go.

2269
01:26:33,409 --> 01:26:34,439
He's so good.

2270
01:26:34,949 --> 01:26:38,019
(Geun Sik wins in a second.)

2271
01:26:39,149 --> 01:26:41,549
- Geun Sik wins. - That was fast.

2272
01:26:41,549 --> 01:26:42,949
(Haha and Geun Sik take their first win.)

2273
01:26:42,949 --> 01:26:44,689
This is the first time I won something here.

2274
01:26:44,689 --> 01:26:49,059
Next is Se Chan...

2275
01:26:49,059 --> 01:26:51,259
(It's between Se Chan...)

2276
01:26:51,259 --> 01:26:53,599
(and Jong Kook.)

2277
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:56,169
You never know.

2278
01:26:56,669 --> 01:26:57,669
Show him, Se Chan.

2279
01:26:58,399 --> 01:27:01,169
If you win this one... Na Eun is watching you.

2280
01:27:01,169 --> 01:27:03,469
- All right? - The table might get lifted.

2281
01:27:03,469 --> 01:27:04,469
Na Eun.

2282
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:06,939
Ready.

2283
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:09,479
Hold on. Wait, Jong Kook.

2284
01:27:09,479 --> 01:27:10,509
What's wrong?

2285
01:27:10,609 --> 01:27:11,949
(His grip is already strong.)

2286
01:27:11,949 --> 01:27:14,349
Show him the strength of a comedian.

2287
01:27:14,379 --> 01:27:16,889
- Let's win. - Look at his arm.

2288
01:27:16,889 --> 01:27:21,829
These are not vessels. They're electrical wires.

2289
01:27:22,059 --> 01:27:23,359
They are wires.

2290
01:27:23,589 --> 01:27:24,589
Set.

2291
01:27:25,059 --> 01:27:26,799
He's different. He's a rock.

2292
01:27:26,799 --> 01:27:27,959
We can do it.

2293
01:27:27,959 --> 01:27:29,799
- Let's go. - Se Chan...

2294
01:27:30,499 --> 01:27:32,869
(Let's go, Se Chan.)

2295
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:35,939
(Na Eun is watching.)

2296
01:27:35,939 --> 01:27:38,409
Set. Go.

2297
01:27:41,179 --> 01:27:42,209
Goodness.

2298
01:27:42,849 --> 01:27:45,949
That hurts, Jong Kook.

2299
01:27:45,949 --> 01:27:47,649
(Too much confidence might give you pain sometimes.)

2300
01:27:47,649 --> 01:27:49,589
That hurts. You knew I wasn't strong.

2301
01:27:49,589 --> 01:27:52,559
- He was too strong. - You knew from the start.

2302
01:27:52,619 --> 01:27:54,359
I wanted to end it fast.

2303
01:27:54,359 --> 01:27:55,759
- You knew I was weak. - Right now...

2304
01:27:55,759 --> 01:27:57,059
I'm sorry.

2305
01:27:57,059 --> 01:27:58,429
I'm sorry.

2306
01:27:58,429 --> 01:27:59,959
- Jong Kook wins. - I didn't know it would hurt.

2307
01:27:59,959 --> 01:28:01,369
- I'm sorry. - That was a good one.

2308
01:28:01,369 --> 01:28:03,429
- I'm sorry. - He's a rock.

2309
01:28:03,429 --> 01:28:05,439
- Next is... - He's really strong, right?

2310
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:06,769
- He is. - Geun Sik...

2311
01:28:07,399 --> 01:28:08,409
and Hang Ho.

2312
01:28:08,409 --> 01:28:09,969
(It's between Hang Ho and Geun Sik.)

2313
01:28:09,969 --> 01:28:10,969
You never know.

2314
01:28:11,239 --> 01:28:13,239
- Jong Kook is so strong. - Hang Ho.

2315
01:28:13,239 --> 01:28:15,049
I'm serious.

2316
01:28:15,049 --> 01:28:16,409
He's a natural.

2317
01:28:16,879 --> 01:28:18,879
- In what? - In using strength.

2318
01:28:18,879 --> 01:28:20,149
- Is he? - He is.

2319
01:28:20,149 --> 01:28:21,849
He's a strong guy.

2320
01:28:22,689 --> 01:28:23,689
(Hang Ho hasn't lost so far.)

2321
01:28:23,689 --> 01:28:26,219
- This is intense. - This is intense.

2322
01:28:26,219 --> 01:28:28,459
I can feel their energy.

2323
01:28:28,459 --> 01:28:29,629
(They're both on a winning streak.)

2324
01:28:29,629 --> 01:28:30,759
You never know.

2325
01:28:30,959 --> 01:28:33,059
(Who will win?)

2326
01:28:33,059 --> 01:28:34,829
Set. Go.

2327
01:28:35,129 --> 01:28:36,869
(Did Geun Sik defend himself...)

2328
01:28:36,869 --> 01:28:40,399
(from Hang Ho's surprise attack?)

2329
01:28:41,469 --> 01:28:42,469
(Groaning)

2330
01:28:43,469 --> 01:28:44,639
(Hang Ho wins again.)

2331
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:45,679
What happened?

2332
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:46,879
Okay.

2333
01:28:49,649 --> 01:28:50,949
What happened?

2334
01:28:50,949 --> 01:28:53,519
- Why did you lose? - He's strong.

2335
01:28:53,519 --> 01:28:55,389
(What do you mean why?)

2336
01:28:55,889 --> 01:28:57,249
He's really strong.

2337
01:28:57,249 --> 01:29:00,259
I only win once.

2338
01:29:00,259 --> 01:29:01,429
Hang Ho wins.

2339
01:29:01,489 --> 01:29:03,759
(Hang Ho wins twice in a row.)

2340
01:29:03,759 --> 01:29:05,029
You never know how it'll turn out.

2341
01:29:05,129 --> 01:29:06,259
Why are you so good?

2342
01:29:06,259 --> 01:29:08,469
Before we get to the finals,

2343
01:29:08,629 --> 01:29:10,429
it'll be between Hang Ho and Jong Kook.

2344
01:29:10,429 --> 01:29:11,669
(It's between Jong Kook and Hang Ho.)

2345
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:14,439
If he beats Jong Kook, it'll be insane.

2346
01:29:14,439 --> 01:29:17,039
He doesn't exercise,

2347
01:29:17,039 --> 01:29:20,779
and he's worked out for over 20 years.

2348
01:29:20,779 --> 01:29:23,649
There's no correlation between working out and arm wrestling.

2349
01:29:23,649 --> 01:29:25,049
This is incredible.

2350
01:29:25,049 --> 01:29:26,179
He's so firm.

2351
01:29:26,249 --> 01:29:27,249
He's soft.

2352
01:29:27,249 --> 01:29:28,619
(Hang Ho is soft.)

2353
01:29:29,219 --> 01:29:31,149
He's a soft tofu.

2354
01:29:31,149 --> 01:29:32,219
His vessels are like water pipes.

2355
01:29:32,219 --> 01:29:34,659
- This is incredible. - Right? He has water pipes.

2356
01:29:34,659 --> 01:29:35,659
This was unexpected.

2357
01:29:35,759 --> 01:29:37,029
He's chubby.

2358
01:29:37,029 --> 01:29:38,659
- How's that possible? - Ready.

2359
01:29:38,659 --> 01:29:41,059
- He's incredible. - Like Jong Kook said,

2360
01:29:41,429 --> 01:29:43,069
arm wrestling is unpredictable.

2361
01:29:43,069 --> 01:29:45,639
We came this far, Hang Ho.

2362
01:29:45,669 --> 01:29:47,539
- Hang Ho. - We can't lose now.

2363
01:29:47,539 --> 01:29:49,109
(The winner of this match...)

2364
01:29:49,109 --> 01:29:53,709
(face the champion in the last match.)

2365
01:29:53,974 --> 01:29:55,044
Go.

2366
01:29:55,044 --> 01:29:56,174
(Groaning)

2367
01:29:56,444 --> 01:29:57,444
Go.

2368
01:29:58,344 --> 01:30:00,314
(Jong Kook is...)

2369
01:30:00,314 --> 01:30:03,214
(on another level.)

2370
01:30:04,854 --> 01:30:06,114
(Jong Kook defeats Hang Ho.)

2371
01:30:06,114 --> 01:30:07,554
Jong Kook wins.

2372
01:30:07,584 --> 01:30:09,254
- Good job, Hang Ho. - I can't face him.

2373
01:30:09,254 --> 01:30:10,284
This is the final match.

2374
01:30:10,284 --> 01:30:11,594
- Now, - This is the real deal.

2375
01:30:11,594 --> 01:30:13,354
- it's the final match. - It is.

2376
01:30:15,524 --> 01:30:17,864
(They're both strong.)

2377
01:30:19,364 --> 01:30:21,764
(This is the big match.)

2378
01:30:22,764 --> 01:30:24,704
(Will it be Jong Kook, the tiger of Running Man?)

2379
01:30:24,704 --> 01:30:26,604
This is like an international match.

2380
01:30:27,704 --> 01:30:29,204
Look at these two.

2381
01:30:29,204 --> 01:30:30,504
(Or will it be muscular Wook Min?)

2382
01:30:30,504 --> 01:30:31,914
They're both professionals.

2383
01:30:32,774 --> 01:30:36,044
(It's tense around here.)

2384
01:30:36,044 --> 01:30:37,784
Look at his hip.

2385
01:30:37,784 --> 01:30:40,214
Look. Look at his hip.

2386
01:30:40,214 --> 01:30:42,124
- He's strong. - Look.

2387
01:30:42,124 --> 01:30:43,154
(There's tension between them.)

2388
01:30:43,154 --> 01:30:45,054
- This... - They're so strong.

2389
01:30:45,054 --> 01:30:46,994
- Ready. - They're like beasts.

2390
01:30:46,994 --> 01:30:47,994
(What will be the result of the legendary match?)

2391
01:30:48,264 --> 01:30:50,294
(They focus all their energy.)

2392
01:30:50,294 --> 01:30:53,594
(It's a counterattack from the families.)

2393
01:30:54,434 --> 01:30:56,234
(You can never stop them.)

2394
01:30:57,034 --> 01:30:59,504
(It's not over until it's over?)

2395
01:31:00,434 --> 01:31:02,044
(You'll survive if you unite...)

2396
01:31:02,044 --> 01:31:03,574
(and die if you split up.)

2397
01:31:03,574 --> 01:31:05,874
(It's the 2nd episode of the 7th anniversary special.)

2398
01:31:05,874 --> 01:31:09,084
(When in Running Man,)

2399
01:31:09,084 --> 01:31:13,014
(do as Running Man members do.)

2400
01:31:14,524 --> 01:31:19,094
(It's unbelievable and extraordinary.)

2401
01:31:19,094 --> 01:31:21,694
(This is as good as a variety show can get.)

2402
01:31:22,364 --> 01:31:24,234
(Family Outing)
