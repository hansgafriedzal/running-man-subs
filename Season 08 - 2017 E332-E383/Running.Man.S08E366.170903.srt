3
00:00:12,698 --> 00:00:14,769
(Rome is the eternal city that has the history of the Roman Empire.)

4
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:17,768
(Bow River lets the visitors enjoy fly fishing in the Rocky Mountains.)

5
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:20,239
(Antelope Canyon is a sandstone formation created by rain and wind.)

6
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:22,638
(Alaska is the home of extreme sports and aurora.)

7
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:25,478
(Bora Bora is Venus' island located in the South Pacific Ocean.)

8
00:00:25,478 --> 00:00:28,809
(Salar de Uyuni is nature's biggest and clearest mirror.)

00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:32,349
(Lake Hillier is a romantic lake that is made pink by plankton.)

12

(Today)

15
00:00:55,468 --> 00:00:56,508
What is going on?

16
00:00:56,508 --> 00:00:58,479
(Something strange is happening.)

17
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:00,108
This isn't easy.

18
00:01:00,108 --> 00:01:01,578
(It's strange,)

19
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:03,049
(difficult,)

20
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:04,648
(and frustrating.)

21
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,949
(What kind of air surrounds them?)

22
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:08,438
It will happen two weeks in a row.

23
00:01:08,638 --> 00:01:11,608
(Chapter 1: It's Always Peaceful in the Beginning)

24
00:01:12,548 --> 00:01:13,748
- Hello. - Hello.

25
00:01:14,048 --> 00:01:15,048
Hello.

26
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:16,649
(It's a summer day that feels like something good will happen.)

27
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:17,649
Hello.

(It's a summer day that feels like something good will happen.)

29
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:20,319
Hello. Hello.

30
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,619
- Hello. - Hello.

31
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:24,089
- Hello. - Where is he?

32
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:25,828
What is this?

33
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:27,858
- I had forgotten about it. - This is the roulette.

34
00:01:27,858 --> 00:01:29,459
- Hello. - Nevis Swing.

35
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:30,628
Hello.

36
00:01:30,828 --> 00:01:32,128
For goodness' sake.

37
00:01:32,628 --> 00:01:33,929
Kwang Soo, please clap the slate.

38
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:35,669
I will clap the slate.

39
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:37,408
- One... - What is up with your hair?

40
00:01:37,408 --> 00:01:38,608
1, 2, 3.

41
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:41,209
(He has a tail.)

42
00:01:41,809 --> 00:01:44,048
He thinks he is European.

43
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:46,149
It's not a hairstyle you should show on TV.

44
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:49,849
He reminds me of a dog.

45
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:50,849
That's right.

46
00:01:51,048 --> 00:01:52,849
- Don't say I remind you of a dog. - An old English sheepdog.

47
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:55,959
Why did you tie the back of your hair?

48
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,089
So Min, you tied my hair and said that it's pretty.

49
00:01:58,089 --> 00:01:59,289
Doesn't it look pretty?

50
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:00,289
(Why are you laughing?)

51
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:01,298
Doesn't it look pretty?

52
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:04,028
If you are trying to be funny, twin tails are better.

53
00:02:04,028 --> 00:02:05,429
I wasn't trying to be funny.

54
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:06,929
You said that it looks okay.

55
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:08,798
He is trying very hard to be funny.

56
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,238
You are already funny.

57
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,308
For goodness' sake. They are saying all kinds of things.

58
00:02:14,308 --> 00:02:16,009
It looks funnier in the distance.

59
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:20,048
Running Man's 3rd Global Project, Half and Half Tour.

60
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:21,548
(Half and Half Tour continues.)

61
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:27,148
(8 recommendations from the members and 8 recommendations from the crew)

62
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:33,529
(Jae Seok is the first one on the roulette with Nevis Swing.)

63
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,928
Nevis Swing is too much.

64
00:02:37,928 --> 00:02:39,768
It will be impossible to go on it.

65
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:41,238
(I feel bad for Jae Seok.)

66
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:44,539
(It's a swing with a height of 160m and the speed of 125km.)

67
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:48,409
(Nevis Swing in New Zealand offers a horrifying freefall.)

68
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:51,308
Jae Seok put his name on the roulette.

69
00:02:51,308 --> 00:02:52,849
Is it possible for him to put his name on it again?

70
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:53,879
- That's right. - Yes, it is.

71
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,518
He can fill the four slots with his name.

72
00:02:55,578 --> 00:02:57,588
I think this is a Yu Jae Seok Special.

73
00:02:57,588 --> 00:02:58,648
Yu Jae Seok Special.

74
00:02:58,648 --> 00:03:01,058
Does that mean I won't be in Korea for a while?

75
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,789
- Will I be staying abroad? - It's about time you retire.

76
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:06,828
- You can do it. - This is driving me crazy.

77
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:09,029
Before the race,

78
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:12,768
we will pick the second recommendation.

79
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:15,638
- That's right. - Let's pick a vacation spot.

80
00:03:15,638 --> 00:03:17,838
That's right. After we pick it, we need to work hard...

81
00:03:17,838 --> 00:03:19,939
and beat the production crew.

82
00:03:21,308 --> 00:03:24,608
(8 recommendations for a vacation that is beautiful and peaceful)

83
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:28,319
(If they want to go to these places, they must beat the production crew.)

84
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,648
Let's go to Bora Bora.

85
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:31,949
The place I chose in Canada is nice.

86
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:33,388
There is a direct flight.

87
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:36,388
The weather will be amazing in Alaska these days.

88
00:03:36,488 --> 00:03:38,928
To be honest, I do want to go to Salar de Uyuni.

89
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:40,328
- It's too far. - It takes 30 hours to go there.

90
00:03:40,328 --> 00:03:41,928
It will take forever to go to Bolivia.

91
00:03:41,928 --> 00:03:44,768
You must be out of your mind to recommend a place like that.

92
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,268
- It will take 40 hours to go there. - You're right.

93
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,338
You'll probably never go there unless it's work related.

94
00:03:49,338 --> 00:03:50,868
Exactly. He's right.

95
00:03:50,868 --> 00:03:53,368
(Everything Jong Kook says is an answer to Se Chan.)

96
00:03:53,368 --> 00:03:54,539
You...

97
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:56,879
- You're forever on his team. - He's my brother.

98
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,279
You should put it correctly.

99
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,849
Se Chan has almost become Jong Kook's lackey.

100
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:03,018
Right, I'm his lackey.

101
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,789
- You're completely his person now. - Yes.

102
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:07,088
He knows how to do variety shows.

103
00:04:07,088 --> 00:04:09,219
(Jong Kook's old lackey is upset.)

104
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:11,328
Who will pick a ball?

105
00:04:11,328 --> 00:04:12,729
- Let's play rock-scissors-paper. - All right.

106
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:14,428
- The winner will pick a ball. - Okay.

107
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:15,529
- Both of them? - Then...

108
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:16,829
The winner will pick a ball for each box.

109
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,068
- Rock-scissors-paper - Rock-scissors-paper

110
00:04:18,998 --> 00:04:20,068
- Rock-scissors-paper - Rock-scissors-paper

111
00:04:20,068 --> 00:04:21,469
- It was done just now. - No.

112
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,368
- Rock-scissors-paper - This will never end.

113
00:04:23,368 --> 00:04:24,938
(They can't seem to find the winner.)

114
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:26,238
- It was done just now. - No.

115
00:04:26,238 --> 00:04:28,779
(They'll have to play it all day at this rate.)

116
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:30,539
How about we play rock-paper instead of rock-scissors-paper?

117
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:31,979
How about we play rock-paper instead of rock-scissors-paper?

118
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,079
- What? - That's a good idea.

119
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,878
(How about this?)

120
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:37,988
That means you lose for certain if you throw rock.

121
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:40,919
(That means you lose for certain if you throw rock.)

122
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,789
Is he a drunkard or what?

123
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,289
- Is he insane? - What was that?

124
00:04:45,428 --> 00:04:46,459
What's wrong with him?

125
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:48,698
"Let's throw rock or paper only."

126
00:04:48,698 --> 00:04:50,128
(Drunk)

127
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:53,198
I said it myself, but it doesn't make sense at all.

128
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:55,698
Wait a minute. Didn't someone say...

129
00:04:55,698 --> 00:04:59,909
it was a good idea just now? Wasn't it you?

130
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:01,639
- It was Jae Seok. - Right.

131
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:03,878
He did say it was a good idea.

132
00:05:03,878 --> 00:05:04,909
- It was Jae Seok. - I thought it was at first.

133
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:07,519
- He did say it was a good idea. - How about this then?

134
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,019
How about we flip our hands?

135
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:10,948
- The majority will survive. - Okay.

136
00:05:10,948 --> 00:05:12,789
- Let's flip our hands - Let's flip our hands

137
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:14,858
- The majority... - This one's the majority.

138
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:17,289
- Only us two didn't flip our hands. - Goodness.

139
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:18,928
- Let's flip our hands - Let's flip our hands

140
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:20,758
(Kwang Soo gets excluded.)

141
00:05:20,998 --> 00:05:22,698
- Let's flip our hands - Okay.

142
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:25,599
- Rock-scissors-paper - Rock-scissors-paper

143
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:28,639
(Ji Hyo and Jae Seok win among the last 4.)

144
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,238
Jae Seok shouldn't win.

145
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,539
(It can't be Jae Seok.)

146
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:34,979
- If you win... - No!

147
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,738
- Make sure you lose. - It's "Let's get it," if I win.

148
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:38,878
- No way. - "Let's get it."

149
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:42,548
- Rock-scissors-paper - Rock-scissors-paper

150
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:46,419
- Thank goodness. - Thank goodness.

151
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:48,818
Luck is still on our side.

152
00:05:48,818 --> 00:05:52,988
I should be the one to pick the destinations.

153
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:57,029
(Which destinations will the lucky Ji Hyo pick?)

154
00:05:57,669 --> 00:05:59,169
How can she win this again?

155
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:00,998
(She'll pick a tourist spot.)

156
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:02,438
Let it be Alaska.

157
00:06:02,438 --> 00:06:03,899
- Ji Hyo. - I hope it's Thailand.

158
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:04,969
(They'll be happy with anywhere.)

159
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:06,868
I hope it's Thailand or Canada.

160
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:09,079
- Canada is good. - Ji Hyo, pick Canada.

161
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,339
Let's go to Bora Bora.

162
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:11,808
Pick Rome.

163
00:06:12,108 --> 00:06:13,909
- Let's go to Rome. - It's too far away.

164
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:16,318
(They want different places, but their goal is the same.)

165
00:06:16,318 --> 00:06:17,419
Canada.

166
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:22,019
(Their goal is to win the staff and add their destination on the list.)

167
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:23,419
- What is it? - It's Bora Bora.

168
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:28,659
(Ji Hyo picks Haha's recommendation, Bora Bora.)

169
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:30,198
- It's Bora Bora. - Yes!

170
00:06:30,198 --> 00:06:31,698
- Good job. - Goodness.

171
00:06:31,698 --> 00:06:33,798
- She's... - Did you know?

172
00:06:34,198 --> 00:06:36,469
(Bora Bora is...)

173
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:39,909
- It's great. - I really want to go there.

174
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:41,178
I want to go there.

175
00:06:41,308 --> 00:06:42,878
- She should pick from the start. - I really want to go.

176
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:45,979
- She should pick from the start. - This...

177
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:47,979
- Let's not hope for good. - It's all horrible.

178
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,248
- Any place will be horrible. - To be honest...

179
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:52,349
Last week's destination was the worst.

180
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:54,419
I know. It's the worst.

181
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,688
(They already have Nevis Swing on the list.)

182
00:06:57,688 --> 00:06:59,289
I hope it's a nice country.

183
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:00,758
Somewhere close from here.

184
00:07:00,758 --> 00:07:04,428
(All the destinations recommended by the staff are like fire pits.)

185
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:08,238
(What will she choose for today's destination candidate?)

186
00:07:08,238 --> 00:07:09,798
- What is that? - "Cage of Death".

187
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:11,238
- "Cage of Death". - It's the crocodile one.

188
00:07:11,238 --> 00:07:14,339
(She picks Cage of Death in Australia.)

189
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:17,378
(A private date with a killer crocodile)

190
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:20,149
(Cage of Death makes you face extreme fear.)

191
00:07:20,548 --> 00:07:22,079
Isn't this the most dangerous one?

192
00:07:23,048 --> 00:07:25,818
- We'll go in a glass tube. - Glass tube?

193
00:07:25,818 --> 00:07:27,488
As a result,

194
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,988
today's destination candidates have become...

195
00:07:28,988 --> 00:07:32,058
Bora Bora, recommended by the Running Man members,

196
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:35,428
and Cage of Death, recommended by the staff.

197
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,269
It's the second part of Half and Half Project.

198
00:07:39,498 --> 00:07:41,998
Today's race is called Race of Wits.

199
00:07:41,998 --> 00:07:44,969
(Half and Half Project Part 2: Race of Wits)

200
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:47,039
Throughout today's race, you'll have to clear some missions...

201
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,839
- in which you use your wits. - Okay.

202
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,709
(They'll have to use their wits to clear the missions.)

203
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:54,779
We lost.

204
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:57,488
You'll win the race if you clear all the missions before 4pm.

205
00:07:57,488 --> 00:07:59,149
If you can't, the staff will win.

206
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:01,318
The second destination will be selected according to the result.

207
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:03,719
Gosh. Let's win the race today.

208
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:05,428
(They're determined to add their places on the list.)

209
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:06,459
Okay.

210
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:07,998
(They're determined to add their places on the list.)

211
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,599
Let's win.

212
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,099
(Which destination will be added to the roulette?)

213
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:14,399
Before we start the race,

214
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,409
- let me introduce a special guest. - Who is it?

215
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:20,108
(Is someone joining them for today's race?)

216
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:21,979
She's the princess of the wit castle.

217
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:23,039
- Please come out. - Really?

218
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,508
(Who will be helping these slow-witted members?)

219
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:25,948
- Is it a woman? - Really?

220
00:08:25,948 --> 00:08:27,719
(Who will be helping these slow-witted members?)

221
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:29,519
(She's here as the witty princess.)

222
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,419
Gosh, it's Soyou.

223
00:08:31,948 --> 00:08:33,389
- Hi! - Hi, Soyou.

224
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:35,619
Soyou's here.

225
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,088
- Hello. - My goodness.

226
00:08:38,088 --> 00:08:39,289
- Come to the middle. - Gosh.

227
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,588
Hello.

228
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,399
- Soyou. - Long time no see.

229
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,068
(She's here to send them on a sweet trip.)

230
00:08:44,328 --> 00:08:46,598
She's going to play the missions with us today?

231
00:08:46,598 --> 00:08:48,899
Soyou will be helping us in hosting the race...

232
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,669
and doing the missions with you today.

233
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:52,909
I see.

234
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:55,578
(She'll help the members win the race.)

235
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:59,078
She's recently started her career as a solo artist after Sistar.

236
00:08:59,578 --> 00:09:01,519
- She'll do just as great. - Right.

237
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:04,889
Of course, she will do great,

238
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:06,718
but she'll be reminded of old times too.

239
00:09:06,818 --> 00:09:09,489
He's working with his Turbo members again.

240
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:11,389
I was independent for a while,

241
00:09:11,588 --> 00:09:13,629
- and now... - It's now three members.

242
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:15,499
Yes, I have sandbags attached to both of my legs.

243
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:18,298
(He has sandbags attached to his legs.)

244
00:09:18,298 --> 00:09:20,129
What do you mean, sandbags?

245
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:21,798
(The two members are burdensome at times.)

246
00:09:21,798 --> 00:09:23,198
Which one is heavier?

247
00:09:23,698 --> 00:09:25,009
They're both heavy.

248
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:28,139
One of them causes too much trouble.

249
00:09:28,838 --> 00:09:32,208
We'll move to the mission place to start with the race.

250
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,379
Okay.

251
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:34,948
(They'll begin the race now.)

252
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,948
(They enter the mission house with Soyou.)

253
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:38,749
- Soyou. - How have you been?

254
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,389
- Great. - Hello.

255
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,259
(What mission is waiting for the members?)

256
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:44,889
- What? - It's a pension.

257
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:46,558
- Goodness. - My gosh.

258
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,198
(There are many snacks.)

259
00:09:48,198 --> 00:09:50,228
- They prepared some snacks too. - What is all that?

260
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,698
Can we have them freely?

261
00:09:51,698 --> 00:09:52,928
It's party time.

262
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:54,139
There's ramyeon too.

263
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:57,139
- What? Gosh, I want ramyeon. - There's cake.

264
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:00,039
Do we have to collect money to get them again?

265
00:10:00,068 --> 00:10:01,978
Isn't that hopscotch?

266
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:04,249
- Soyou is hosting the race. - Great.

267
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:06,249
- Soyou is the host. - Nice.

268
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:08,078
- Soyou. - MC Soyou.

269
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:10,019
- What a healthy host. - She's the host.

270
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:13,519
From now on, Soyou will be hosting the race.

271
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:17,218
You'll do various missions such as guessing all different answers.

272
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:19,759
The race will end as soon as you clear at least one of them.

273
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,359
You will win the race if you clear the mission before 4pm.

274
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:24,529
The staff will win if you can't.

275
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:27,029
- Let's go to Bora Bora. - Is it nice?

276
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:29,499
- Let's clear it right away. - Let's go.

277
00:10:29,798 --> 00:10:32,639
- Bora Bora is such a nice place. - Let's take this chance.

278
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,178
We'll begin the mission.

279
00:10:34,178 --> 00:10:37,649
Every one of you needs to clear the mission this time.

280
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:39,578
The mission is Pilates.

281
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:42,478
(Pilates)

282
00:10:42,848 --> 00:10:44,848
I've brought a massage ball.

283
00:10:44,848 --> 00:10:47,458
I'll massage your stiff muscles.

284
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,558
That sounds great.

285
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:50,489
- Jae Seok has a lot of them. - Right.

286
00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:52,728
But the thing is that all of you must not make any sound...

287
00:10:52,728 --> 00:10:55,198
for 10 seconds if you want to clear this mission.

288
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:56,999
(All of them must not make a sound.)

289
00:10:57,468 --> 00:11:04,369
(They must endure Soyou's painful massage.)

290
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:05,409
(So they're telling us to fail.)

291
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:07,478
This isn't going to happen.

292
00:11:07,478 --> 00:11:09,308
It's impossible.

293
00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:12,548
It may be painful, but it may feel good.

294
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:13,948
Se Chan. Go first.

295
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:16,678
He's pretty stocky.

296
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,588
He is. Look here.

297
00:11:18,588 --> 00:11:20,318
(You can count on me.)

298
00:11:20,318 --> 00:11:22,019
By the way, Jong Kook.

299
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:24,629
You're recommending Se Chan for everything.

300
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:27,058
(Did you guys truly form a team?)

301
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:28,759
(Feeling guilty)

302
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:30,869
I am? I mean...

303
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:33,029
I'm feeling upset now. Why are you being like that all of a sudden?

304
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:34,499
- I mean... - Isn't that too much?

305
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:36,269
I'm sorry, but he only does the cutest things.

306
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:38,609
(He's such a loyal boy.)

307
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:41,379
(Feeling upset)

308
00:11:41,609 --> 00:11:43,478
- You're good at enduring pain. - Right, Ji Hyo is.

309
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:45,048
- Right. - She can put up with it.

310
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:47,178
- Try it. - This will feel good.

311
00:11:47,178 --> 00:11:50,478
This will feel good. I'll go easy in the beginning.

312
00:11:50,478 --> 00:11:51,789
- I'll go easy. - Then I'll do it.

313
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:53,718
- Then I'll do it. - I'll do it.

314
00:11:53,718 --> 00:11:56,419
(Everyone suddenly volunteers.)

315
00:11:56,619 --> 00:11:57,759
I'll do it.

316
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,159
No, I'll do it.

317
00:11:59,728 --> 00:12:00,798
- No. - No, I'll do it.

318
00:12:01,698 --> 00:12:02,828
What are you doing?

319
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,129
Stop.

320
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:05,399
(Pressing hard)

321
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,598
Not there.

322
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:09,568
(He massages Kwang Soo's bottom.)

323
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,009
Goodness.

324
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:12,938
(While everyone's busy applying for the class)

325
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:14,938
Maybe I should cook some ramyeon.

326
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:18,509
Maybe I should cook some ramyeon.

327
00:12:18,749 --> 00:12:22,548
(So Min heads to the kitchen as well.)

328
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:23,948
Let's eat something.

329
00:12:23,948 --> 00:12:27,659
(Wait a minute. He never eats ramyeon to stay healthy.)

330
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:28,958
Let Haha do it.

331
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,188
What are you doing?

332
00:12:31,188 --> 00:12:32,188
(He glances at the others.)

333
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:33,789
Can we have ramyeon?

334
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:35,659
- Do as you please. - Can we?

335
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:37,428
Let go. Goodness.

336
00:12:37,428 --> 00:12:38,428
So you're doing it, right?

337
00:12:38,428 --> 00:12:43,938
(So Min suspiciously hovers around the kitchen.)

338
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:48,578
- Hey, So Min. - What?

339
00:12:48,578 --> 00:12:49,909
What are you doing? Come here.

340
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:52,509
What are you doing? Come over here.

341
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:53,808
(The members frequent the kitchen.)

342
00:12:53,808 --> 00:12:55,978
I'm sorry, but I'm getting a massage now.

343
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:58,218
- I mean... Guys. - Goodness.

344
00:12:58,218 --> 00:12:59,448
I'm trying this out now.

345
00:12:59,718 --> 00:13:01,058
- Let's all focus. - Come here.

346
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:03,088
This isn't right.

347
00:13:03,088 --> 00:13:04,289
Come quick.

348
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:05,458
(She's preparing to cook ramyeon.)

349
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,529
Haha.

350
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:08,198
Even if it feels good, don't make any sound.

351
00:13:09,058 --> 00:13:10,159
Goodness.

352
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,428
It's 10 seconds. Tell me when you want to begin.

353
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:12,499
It's the beginner's stage.

354
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:13,769
- Your hands. - My neck hurts.

355
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,598
Move up a little.

356
00:13:16,068 --> 00:13:17,468
A little more. Good.

357
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:18,568
I'll go now.

358
00:13:18,568 --> 00:13:19,739
Start.

359
00:13:19,739 --> 00:13:21,039
Come here.

360
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:26,048
(Soyou's gentle massage calls for a bright smile.)

361
00:13:26,249 --> 00:13:27,818
How hard will it get later?

362
00:13:27,818 --> 00:13:30,048
(What do you think? Doesn't it feel good?)

363
00:13:30,948 --> 00:13:32,749
Endure a little more.

364
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:35,218
(He'll succeed if he endures 3 more seconds.)

365
00:13:35,218 --> 00:13:37,289
- Doesn't it feel good? - Endure!

366
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:38,789
- He succeeds. - Great.

367
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:40,359
(Haha succeeds.)

368
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,499
(Pinching)

369
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:45,298
He just pinched me.

370
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:47,669
It's a misunderstanding.

371
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:49,399
- That was a misunderstanding. - You endured it well.

372
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:51,369
- Haha. - Haha pinched me.

373
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:53,239
- Haha. - Hey, you should get it too.

374
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:54,379
Don't you feel better though?

375
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,379
- Haha. - My body feels better now.

376
00:13:57,478 --> 00:13:58,909
It feels better after the massage.

377
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:01,019
So Min!

378
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,779
- I just wanted to drink water. - What are you doing? Come here.

379
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:06,019
- I just wanted some water. - We're working. What are you doing?

380
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:07,958
- I should wash my hands. - I got the massage.

381
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:11,889
(Haha gets into the kitchen after his challenge.)

382
00:14:12,088 --> 00:14:15,029
Hey, we should focus on filming. The same goes for you too, Haha.

383
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:16,098
I finished my challenge.

384
00:14:16,098 --> 00:14:17,828
- Even so, you should stay. - Come here already.

385
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:19,468
- What on earth are you doing? - I'm starving.

386
00:14:19,468 --> 00:14:20,769
- Don't eat ramyeon. - This is...

387
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:23,639
Soyou came to help us out today. You shouldn't be rude.

388
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:25,438
Who's next?

389
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:27,578
- What do we have to do? - Which part will you massage?

390
00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:29,379
- Which part is it? - What's the area?

391
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:31,808
- The one who can endure should try. - Should I massage the bottom?

392
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:34,279
- Goodness, the bottom? - The bottom?

393
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:35,779
Then should I give this a try?

394
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:37,489
(I have the best bottom.)

395
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:40,348
- No, your bottom is saggy. - Your bottom is flat.

396
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:43,119
- You can't. It's so flat. - Your bottom isn't good enough.

397
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:44,859
- What are you talking about? - Do you not have a bottom?

398
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:46,359
(Soyou is feeling disappointed.)

399
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:48,359
- No, it's a misunderstanding. - They are so bony.

400
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,899
Fine. I do admit that a long time ago, my bottom was a bit flat,

401
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:52,068
but not now.

402
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:57,139
(What is he talking about? For 33 years, his bottom has been flat.)

403
00:14:57,468 --> 00:14:59,769
It took me a while for me to find his bottom and pinch it.

404
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:01,379
- You didn't pinch my bottom. - What kind of...

405
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:02,578
(It happened a few minutes ago.)

406
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:04,279
- I couldn't pinch anything. - That wasn't my bottom.

407
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,548
(Only the universe knows the truth.)

408
00:15:06,978 --> 00:15:09,019
- Let's hurry. Who wants to go? - This isn't right.

409
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:12,688
- Ji Hyo, do you want to try? - So Min, what are you doing?

410
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:13,989
(So Min heads to the microwave with ramyeon.)

411
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:16,389
- You can't cook it like that. - Is it good? Have you tried this?

412
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:18,759
- Aren't we going to play this? - You can't cook it like that.

413
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:22,428
Hear me out. So Min put the raw ramyeon inside the microwave.

414
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:24,068
- What are you doing? - Will that even work?

415
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:27,029
- Seok Jin, that's how you cook it. - Let's eat ramyeon later together.

416
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,938
What was So Min thinking? Goodness.

417
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:32,468
- Cook it now. Get rid of it though. - Let's eat it later all together.

418
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:36,838
(What is the reason for their obsession over ramyeon today?)

419
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:38,308
Ji Hyo, this isn't easy.

420
00:15:38,308 --> 00:15:40,649
(Ji Hyo, this isn't easy.)

421
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,678
Why do you keep eating today?

422
00:15:43,678 --> 00:15:46,019
(They're acting suspiciously, but So Min is being even more suspicious.)

423
00:15:47,718 --> 00:15:53,289
(Chapter 2: Seok Jin and 7 Missions)

424
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:54,298
(The start of everything)

425
00:15:54,298 --> 00:15:55,659
- Hello. - Hi.

426
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:56,958
- Hi. - Hi.

427
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,468
- Hi, Jae Seok. - Seok Jin isn't here now.

428
00:15:58,468 --> 00:16:00,098
- Hello. - I don't think he's here.

429
00:16:00,098 --> 00:16:01,098
He's not here yet.

430
00:16:01,098 --> 00:16:03,169
- Seok Jin isn't here right now. - We know.

431
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:04,169
This is Seok Jin's special then.

432
00:16:05,068 --> 00:16:08,539
(Seok Jin is the only one who's not present. Does that imply...)

433
00:16:09,308 --> 00:16:12,379
Soon, there will be various types of missions for you to accomplish.

434
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:15,919
Each mission will require different numbers of members to succeed them.

435
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:18,318
All of us are bad at reading situations.

436
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:22,119
Seok Jin is the worst at it, but luckily, he's not here right now.

437
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:23,389
- We do have some hope. - That's right.

438
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:26,558
- This race will continue until 4pm. - Really?

439
00:16:26,558 --> 00:16:29,659
If you accomplish even one of those missions, it will be your win.

440
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:32,899
(If they accomplish a mission, they'll win and the race will end.)

441
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:34,369
- It will end right away? - Really?

442
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,669
If you don't accomplish any mission, we will win the race.

443
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:39,869
Depending on the result, the destination will be chosen.

444
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:43,379
Like last week, the member with the most mission money can buy...

445
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:45,048
- the name tags for the roulette. - This is the fun part of the game.

446
00:16:45,048 --> 00:16:46,779
You're right. We can't forget about the money.

447
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:47,779
This is fun.

448
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:51,348
Your hidden mission will be a way to acquire the mission money.

449
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:54,289
The mission is Deceive Seok Jin who is usually clueless of situations.

450
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:59,188
(The mission for them to obtain the money is Deceive Seok Jin.)

451
00:16:59,188 --> 00:17:00,859
- This is an easy mission. - Really?

452
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:02,928
- This can't count as a mission. - How can we fail at that?

453
00:17:02,928 --> 00:17:04,169
Please bring the board in.

454
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:05,169
What is that?

455
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:09,069
(It won't be as easy as you think. What will the hidden missions be?)

456
00:17:09,768 --> 00:17:13,369
(There are 7 slots! There are 7 stages of hidden missions.)

457
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:16,678
(Empty pot, laundry, peeled onions, Seok Jin's belongings,)

458
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,478
(pace counter, screaming, and the last food)

459
00:17:19,478 --> 00:17:21,248
We have to do all these missions?

460
00:17:22,379 --> 00:17:23,919
- This one is challenging. - This one will be difficult.

461
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,549
- "Don't make him say he wants it." - That one looks hard.

462
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:27,248
He will definitely want to have some of the ramyeon.

463
00:17:27,248 --> 00:17:28,559
That's almost a given.

464
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,988
He likes to interfere in our businesses.

465
00:17:30,988 --> 00:17:32,559
He always asks what we're doing.

466
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,698
But when he's doing something,

467
00:17:34,829 --> 00:17:37,369
- he won't show any interest. - That's true too.

468
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:40,369
Let me explain you the mission. This will be an individual match.

469
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:43,139
Before the group mission ends, you have to accomplish...

470
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:44,909
seven hidden missions in this order.

471
00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:46,109
- In order? - Really?

472
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:48,879
You could choose the order after discussing it among yourselves.

473
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:51,748
Note that you must finish missions placed later in the order more.

474
00:17:51,748 --> 00:17:54,278
Please think about this carefully, and come up with your order.

475
00:17:54,718 --> 00:17:57,419
Everyone can participate in accomplishing these missions.

476
00:17:57,788 --> 00:18:00,549
But only the first member who brings items that proves you succeeded...

477
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:02,958
the missions will be considered as the winner.

478
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,359
We have to prove with the items.

479
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:06,458
The winner will receive 20 dollars.

480
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,958
After this, you will move onto the next mission.

481
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:11,369
But if you all fail, we'll multiply 10 dollars and the number for the...

482
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:13,399
stage of the mission, and Seok Jin will receive that much money.

483
00:18:13,399 --> 00:18:15,669
(Seok Jin will get 10 dollars times the stage number for the mission.)

484
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:18,169
- We have no choice but to place... - We'll only do that once?

485
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:19,938
We should only do it once or twice. We can't eat more than that.

486
00:18:19,938 --> 00:18:21,238
- That's better. - I agree.

487
00:18:21,879 --> 00:18:23,109
Should we put this in the fourth stage?

488
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:24,579
There are four types of food.

489
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:26,909
(It's better to put hard missions in the 1st stage and easy ones in 7th.)

490
00:18:28,018 --> 00:18:30,579
(Cook and eat ramyeon without Seok Jin asking for some of the ramyeon.)

491
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:33,448
(Do the laundry without him asking if they're doing the laundry.)

492
00:18:33,448 --> 00:18:36,119
(Steal 3 of Seok Jin's belongings without getting caught.)

493
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:38,859
(Feed him 4 kinds of food without him saying he doesn't want to eat.)

494
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:41,559
(Peel 5 onions, and Seok Jin cannot say, "onion" during that time.)

495
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:44,268
(Scream 6 times for 3 seconds, and he can't comment that they're loud.)

496
00:18:44,268 --> 00:18:46,629
(Do 7,000 counts, and he cannot tell them to stay still.)

497
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:49,038
This isn't easy.

498
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:50,069
This is so hard.

499
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,669
If I can't win the mission with ramyeon, it will be tough for me.

500
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:56,639
- Everyone will go for that mission. - Exactly.

501
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,309
Should I eat ramyeon today?

502
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:00,149
(They all aim for the first mission.)

503
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:04,119
(The members have gotten around to their plan right away.)

504
00:19:04,649 --> 00:19:08,659
(Jong Kook heads to the kitchen while there's chaos.)

505
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:11,288
(So Min follows Jong Kook to the kitchen.)

506
00:19:11,288 --> 00:19:15,198
(There was a reason why everyone was obsessed with ramyeon today.)

507
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:19,968
(Everyone tried to cook it since the 1st stage mission was easy.)

508
00:19:19,968 --> 00:19:23,038
(Goodness, they sure love ramyeon, don't they?)

509
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:24,538
Give it a try.

510
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,669
- Come. - Take a seat.

511
00:19:26,468 --> 00:19:27,738
Show her that you have a strong hip joint.

512
00:19:27,738 --> 00:19:28,738
- This is the place, right? - It is.

513
00:19:28,738 --> 00:19:30,139
- Lie down like this. - Lie on your stomach.

514
00:19:30,139 --> 00:19:31,708
- Lie on your stomach. - I have to hold it for 10 seconds.

515
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:35,018
- Show your strong hip joint. - Se Chan, I'll step on you lightly.

516
00:19:35,018 --> 00:19:36,678
- But Soyou. - Yes?

517
00:19:36,678 --> 00:19:38,149
You have a proper license for this, right?

518
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:39,988
(Se Chan has the right to know.)

519
00:19:39,988 --> 00:19:41,958
- I'll step on you just slightly. - Why did you ask her that?

520
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,458
How could you ask her that?

521
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,458
I'll start.

522
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,129
(Can Se Chan hold out for 10 seconds?)

523
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:49,829
(Making a small sound)

524
00:19:51,129 --> 00:19:52,928
He failed.

525
00:19:52,928 --> 00:19:54,369
- What? - What happened?

526
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:55,998
- He didn't say anything. - Se Chan screamed.

527
00:19:55,998 --> 00:19:57,038
- When? - No, he didn't.

528
00:19:57,038 --> 00:19:58,309
- Did you scream? - I didn't.

529
00:19:58,669 --> 00:19:59,669
This is what I did.

530
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:01,208
You can't count that.

531
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,309
Since he failed, you lost your chance. You failed the first round.

532
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:04,748
(Because of Se Chan, they failed the 1st round.)

533
00:20:04,748 --> 00:20:06,549
- Why? - That's not right.

534
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:07,579
- What happened? - Why?

535
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:09,248
- This is what I did, Jong Kook. - Did you scream?

536
00:20:09,248 --> 00:20:11,119
That can't count as making a sound.

537
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:13,248
Jong Kook, why are you protecting him. You should scold him.

538
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:15,288
(That's not like you, Jong Kook.)

539
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:19,389
- I'm sorry. I just closed my mouth. - Jong Kook.

540
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,129
- What's gotten into you? - I just closed my mouth.

541
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:23,159
- Good job. - What are you talking about?

542
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:24,399
- You had no other choice. - That's right.

543
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:26,169
Jae Seok, So Min is looking for something.

544
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:28,669
- This is what I did. - That's what you did?

545
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:30,938
Soyou, shouldn't Jae Seok get the massage too?

546
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:32,538
That's right. He didn't get it yet.

547
00:20:32,538 --> 00:20:34,309
- Kwang Soo should get it first. - Jae Seok, try it first.

548
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:36,978
- This is the right one, isn't it? - It's bigger.

549
00:20:36,978 --> 00:20:38,379
(Meanwhile, quietly in the kitchen,)

550
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:39,379
(he finishes cooking ramyeon.)

551
00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:41,319
Jae Seok, that's mine. Come on. I cooked that ramyeon.

552
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,319
You're done cooking ramyeon?

553
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:44,389
(You're done cooking ramyeon?)

554
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:47,619
You're done cooking ramyeon?

555
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:49,859
You cooked it with the microwave?

556
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:52,758
(He flees to the staircase to get rid of it.)

557
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:55,659
- It really worked? - Where's Jae Seok? He's eating.

558
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:03,069
(Whoever finishes the mission first can receive the mission money.)

559
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:04,909
(He eats it with the tongs.)

560
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:05,938
Hey, Jae Seok!

561
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:09,409
He left already.

562
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:11,579
Where is he? Hey, Jae Seok!

563
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:13,748
(Where is he? Hey, Jae Seok!)

564
00:21:13,748 --> 00:21:14,748
How could you eat it by yourself?

565
00:21:14,748 --> 00:21:17,049
(How could you eat it by yourself?)

566
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:21,389
You cooked this in the microwave? You could do it?

567
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:22,919
(Why is he here now?)

568
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,528
"Don't make him say he wants some."

569
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:31,528
(He has to eat it while Seok Jin doesn't ask for a mouthful.)

570
00:21:31,528 --> 00:21:35,369
(This mission with ramyeon might be easier than they thought.)

571
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,809
(They've known him for 7 years, and considering the way he talks...)

572
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:41,178
He doesn't say, "a mouthful" often.

573
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,748
(Can Jae Seok avoid hearing "a mouthful" from Seok Jin?)

574
00:21:44,748 --> 00:21:46,948
Hey, is it done?

575
00:21:46,948 --> 00:21:49,049
(Can Jae Seok avoid hearing "a mouthful" from Seok Jin?)

576
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:50,688
(Getting close)

577
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:54,559
Let me eat a mouthful of it.

578
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,919
(Let me eat a mouthful of it.)

579
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:01,198
(You want to have a mouthful?)

580
00:22:01,198 --> 00:22:05,069
(Jae Seok fails the 1st stage mission.)

581
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:07,028
(Why did you have to say the word "a mouthful" today?)

582
00:22:07,028 --> 00:22:08,069
Goodness.

583
00:22:08,768 --> 00:22:10,708
- Jae Seok. - Did he eat your ramyeon?

584
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:12,669
I couldn't eat it. He's not going to share.

585
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:13,869
Why did he ask for a mouthful?

586
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:16,909
Goodness, why did you have to eat the ramyeon?

587
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:19,948
(Then does it mean that this mission is over?)

588
00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:21,748
We should've eaten it together.

589
00:22:21,748 --> 00:22:23,549
(With Jae Seok's failure, no one gets to acquire the mission money.)

590
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:25,919
But you know that I didn't step on you hard, don't you?

591
00:22:26,248 --> 00:22:27,248
What happened?

592
00:22:28,718 --> 00:22:32,028
(He's clueless. Eating someone else's ramyeon is tastier.)

593
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:37,968
(Eating ramyeon without Seok Jin saying, "a mouthful" is over.)

594
00:22:37,968 --> 00:22:41,669
(Do laundry for 20 minutes, and he can't say, "Are you doing laundry?")

595
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:43,268
I guess cooking in the microwave works.

596
00:22:43,268 --> 00:22:44,268
(Changing)

597
00:22:44,268 --> 00:22:48,079
(Since Jae Seok failed the mission, the producer signals a new number.)

598
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:50,079
(Do laundry for 20 minutes, and he can't say, "Are you doing laundry?")

599
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,109
Laundry machine...

600
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:53,909
(Do laundry for 20 minutes, and he can't say, "Are you doing laundry?")

601
00:22:54,379 --> 00:22:56,178
- What are you doing? - Hey!

602
00:22:56,778 --> 00:22:58,988
(She finds the laundry machine in the bathroom.)

603
00:23:01,518 --> 00:23:03,089
(Following her in)

604
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:04,129
Don't come.

605
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,559
Hey, be civil. Let me run the machine just once.

606
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,299
- Hey, I can't fight with you. - Let me run it just once.

607
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:12,928
- Please, Se Chan. Let me have it. - I'll put my socks.

608
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:14,369
- Wait. - Hold on.

609
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:16,169
Let's play rock-scissors-paper.

610
00:23:16,468 --> 00:23:18,008
- Rock-scissors... - Which one will you play?

611
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:19,639
- I'll play rock. - You'll play rock?

612
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:20,738
- Yes. - Keep your word.

613
00:23:20,738 --> 00:23:21,738
Play paper.

614
00:23:21,738 --> 00:23:23,538
- I'll play paper. You play rock. - Okay.

615
00:23:23,538 --> 00:23:24,579
- Understood? - Yes.

616
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,478
Rock-scissors-paper.

617
00:23:26,478 --> 00:23:29,178
(Se Chan wins, and So Min loses. They were contrary to their words.)

618
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:33,018
(I'm so furious, you little con artist.)

619
00:23:33,518 --> 00:23:34,559
He's mean.

620
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,059
(Se Chan manages to take the laundry machine from So Min.)

621
00:23:37,928 --> 00:23:39,458
- How do I start the machine? - Gosh, it's hot.

622
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:40,528
I guess this is it.

623
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:42,559
It's so hot in here.

624
00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:44,728
(Scoffing)

625
00:23:44,968 --> 00:23:47,228
- Seok Jin. - Yes?

626
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:51,738
(Jong Kook adds his laundry to Se Chan's.)

627
00:23:51,738 --> 00:23:54,038
(Ji Hyo adds hers too.)

628
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:57,649
(Everyone puts in laundry.)

629
00:23:58,448 --> 00:24:00,819
(They have to wait 20 minutes.)

630
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:03,218
We failed the first step because of Se Chan, right?

631
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:04,718
Jong Kook said it was okay.

632
00:24:04,718 --> 00:24:06,018
(Shameless)

633
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:10,288
- He said it was okay. - Se Chan was just practicing.

634
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:13,329
Kwang Soo had to succeed.

635
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:14,899
- But he failed. - But he failed.

636
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:21,599
(Kwang Soo was the third person to try the pilates class.)

637
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:23,339
Hey.

638
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:27,778
(Kwang Soo failed right away.)

639
00:24:28,538 --> 00:24:30,038
(All the blame is put on Kwang Soo.)

640
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:31,649
It was Kwang Soo's fault.

641
00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:34,119
Jae Seok was given a chance too.

642
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:36,018
Are you listening to me?

643
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:37,319
He was given a chance too.

644
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:39,018
But he made a sound.

645
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:40,919
Kwang Soo.

646
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,619
(Kiss)

647
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:47,089
Kwang Soo. I get it.

648
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:48,458
(I feel jealous of Se Chan.)

649
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,498
This mission has to be fulfilled by everyone.

650
00:24:51,498 --> 00:24:53,569
Balance the Ball.

651
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:56,639
(Balance the Ball)

652
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:58,409
- Balance the Ball? - Balance the Ball?

653
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:01,309
You will run nuts down a straw with one hand.

654
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:04,178
While doing so, you have to make sure...

655
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:07,619
the ping-pong ball doesn't fall from the top of the straw.

656
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:09,278
- That sounds hard. - I can't do that.

657
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:11,349
Each person has one chance.

658
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:13,889
You'll be given some time to practice.

659
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:15,288
- We can practice? That's good. - Yes.

660
00:25:15,288 --> 00:25:16,659
Can you demonstrate?

661
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:19,089
You put the ping-pong ball on the nuts.

662
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:21,359
- You have one chance? - Is it possible?

663
00:25:21,428 --> 00:25:22,899
- Is it possible? - You run them down.

664
00:25:22,899 --> 00:25:23,899
(Trembling)

665
00:25:25,198 --> 00:25:26,829
Your hands are trembling.

666
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:29,768
- I'm nervous. - You are?

667
00:25:29,768 --> 00:25:32,109
- Soyou, do you drink a lot? - Do you drink a lot?

668
00:25:32,238 --> 00:25:35,109
Are you sure it's because you're nervous?

669
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:36,809
It's so hot.

670
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:40,008
- Like this. - It's impossible.

671
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:41,218
- I succeeded. - I succeeded.

672
00:25:41,448 --> 00:25:42,649
Like this.

673
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:43,678
It's possible.

674
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:45,718
- Is this a success? - Yes.

675
00:25:45,718 --> 00:25:47,458
- You can use your hand? - Yes.

676
00:25:47,518 --> 00:25:48,819
(Everyone is busy practicing.)

677
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:50,728
You have to move all three nuts at once.

678
00:25:50,728 --> 00:25:51,889
(Jong Kook is checking on the laundry.)

679
00:25:51,889 --> 00:25:53,059
We have to take out the laundry.

680
00:25:54,228 --> 00:25:56,258
(Let's see.)

681
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,268
(It's not done yet.)

682
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:01,698
We've put in the laundry.

683
00:26:02,968 --> 00:26:04,839
You hold all three nuts...

684
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:06,669
- at once. - I have to use the bathroom.

685
00:26:06,968 --> 00:26:08,109
Hey.

686
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:09,309
- At once. - I have to use the bathroom.

687
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:11,649
Hey.

688
00:26:12,379 --> 00:26:17,849
(Seok Jin enters the bathroom where the washing machine is.)

689
00:26:18,819 --> 00:26:24,889
(Their secret mission might get revealed.)

690
00:26:28,428 --> 00:26:29,458
I have to pee.

691
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:33,169
- There are cameras. - Cameras...

692
00:26:33,428 --> 00:26:34,498
What are you going to do?

693
00:26:34,498 --> 00:26:35,968
I have to use the bathroom.

694
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:37,569
I have to pee.

695
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:39,409
What should he do?

696
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:40,569
(I don't think it's a good idea.)

697
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:43,478
I have to pee. Can you go out for a minute?

698
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:45,379
There's another camera. I didn't see it before.

699
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:46,579
Come out.

700
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:48,018
There are cameras.

701
00:26:48,018 --> 00:26:51,119
- There are cameras everywhere. - Why are there cameras?

702
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:53,188
(Seok Jin finds the cameras only now.)

703
00:26:53,288 --> 00:26:57,389
(There are cameras even in the bathroom?)

704
00:26:57,389 --> 00:26:58,589
(Glancing)

705
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:01,629
Seok Jin is in the bathroom.

706
00:27:01,629 --> 00:27:03,099
(What is going to happen?)

707
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:07,198
(Has he noticed the washing machine mission?)

708
00:27:07,198 --> 00:27:08,268
(Looking away)

709
00:27:10,468 --> 00:27:15,139
(Has he noticed?)

710
00:27:15,139 --> 00:27:19,508
(The moment Seok Jin says, "Are you doing the laundry?”)

711
00:27:19,508 --> 00:27:23,448
(the mission fails.)

712
00:27:23,448 --> 00:27:25,718
It's so hot in here.

713
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:29,958
(He is not interested in the washing machine.)

714
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:31,728
- Okay. - Excuse me.

715
00:27:31,889 --> 00:27:34,799
- Your members... - Members?

716
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,528
Don't say that.

717
00:27:36,528 --> 00:27:39,428
- Is this your gang's workshop? - It's not like that.

718
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:41,069
- Use just one hand. - Just one hand?

719
00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:42,238
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

720
00:27:42,238 --> 00:27:45,468
Give up if you don't know how to do it.

721
00:27:45,468 --> 00:27:46,669
Kwang Soo, let me try.

722
00:27:46,738 --> 00:27:48,278
Se Chan, you try.

723
00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:49,478
- Good. - Sorry.

724
00:27:49,478 --> 00:27:51,478
Se Chan is good at these things.

725
00:27:51,478 --> 00:27:52,649
Get out of his way.

726
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:54,849
- What happened to you? - Get out.

727
00:27:55,649 --> 00:27:57,248
Move.

728
00:27:57,619 --> 00:27:59,948
(Kicking)

729
00:27:59,948 --> 00:28:02,059
Why are you doing this to me?

730
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:03,688
Why?

731
00:28:03,688 --> 00:28:05,758
(Jong Kook is mine.)

732
00:28:05,758 --> 00:28:08,129
Let's try one by one. Let's start from Jae Seok.

733
00:28:08,129 --> 00:28:09,928
- All right. - Sit down. Be serious.

734
00:28:09,928 --> 00:28:12,369
(Jong Kook is like a drill instructor.)

735
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:14,768
Sit down.

736
00:28:14,768 --> 00:28:16,339
- Listen to him. - Come on.

737
00:28:16,339 --> 00:28:17,639
I've been practicing standing up.

738
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:19,069
- Sit down. - You better sit down.

739
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:21,278
If you stand up...

740
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:23,038
- The ball might fall. - Exactly.

741
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:24,278
My goodness.

742
00:28:24,278 --> 00:28:25,708
What are you?

743
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:28,778
- Are you his secretary? - I'm assisting him.

744
00:28:29,178 --> 00:28:31,589
It looks very stable. Good.

745
00:28:31,589 --> 00:28:32,819
- Focus. - You have to succeed.

746
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:34,258
- This is my only chance, right? - You have to.

747
00:28:34,258 --> 00:28:36,258
- Let me go first. - Let's start from someone else.

748
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:37,389
We should begin...

749
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:39,589
Why don't we start from Haha?

750
00:28:39,829 --> 00:28:40,899
Let's decide who will go first.

751
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:42,799
- You go first. - I'll go first.

752
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:45,669
- I'll do it at the end. - That sounds good.

753
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:47,099
- Ji Hyo will succeed. - Look at that.

754
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:48,938
She's succeeded. Amazing.

755
00:28:48,938 --> 00:28:49,938
(Smooth)

756
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:53,538
(Her movement looks so stable.)

757
00:28:53,538 --> 00:28:54,738
Unbelievable.

758
00:28:56,978 --> 00:28:58,809
(Shaking)

759
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:05,649
(Will she successfully put the nuts down on the table?)

760
00:29:05,649 --> 00:29:06,788
Done.

761
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:08,819
(Done)

762
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:10,089
I'm done.

763
00:29:10,518 --> 00:29:14,829
(Ji Hyo has succeeded.)

764
00:29:14,829 --> 00:29:16,659
Haha, if you fail,

765
00:29:17,258 --> 00:29:20,028
I'll hit you.

766
00:29:20,428 --> 00:29:21,768
You know Jong Kook has my back.

767
00:29:21,768 --> 00:29:22,968
(What do you mean?)

768
00:29:22,968 --> 00:29:25,268
Hold on. He talked to me.

769
00:29:25,268 --> 00:29:26,938
(Distracted)

770
00:29:26,938 --> 00:29:28,109
Don't talk to him.

771
00:29:28,178 --> 00:29:29,909
Excuse me. Please keep quiet.

772
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:33,278
(Please keep quiet.)

773
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:35,718
- Quiet. - My goodness.

774
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:38,518
There were eight eyes glaring at me.

775
00:29:38,518 --> 00:29:40,988
(Hurt)

776
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:43,919
You, you, you, and you. Why were you glaring at me?

777
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,288
(Why were you glaring at me?)

778
00:29:45,288 --> 00:29:46,988
- What? - Why were you glaring?

779
00:29:46,988 --> 00:29:49,299
- I just wanted to. - Gosh, I can't believe this.

780
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:51,198
(I'm so hurt.)

781
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:53,169
I'll try later.

782
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:54,299
(Nervous)

783
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:55,899
- All right. - You try first.

784
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:59,309
I've been practicing, but it's not so easy.

785
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:00,909
(It's not so easy.)

786
00:30:00,909 --> 00:30:02,639
Why don't you let someone else try then?

787
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:05,748
(Jae Seok annoys Jong Kook.)

788
00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:07,349
Be polite to each other.

789
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:11,819
(Be polite to each other.)

790
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:14,018
(How dare you speak that way to our boss?)

791
00:30:14,018 --> 00:30:15,319
- All right. - Good job.

792
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:18,488
Gosh, I can't believe this.

793
00:30:19,028 --> 00:30:22,458
(According to the ranking, Jong Kook goes first.)

794
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:26,069
It looks good. Just continue.

795
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:27,768
Just keep going.

796
00:30:27,768 --> 00:30:30,339
(He just has to run the nuts down now.)

797
00:30:33,238 --> 00:30:34,978
(Falling)

798
00:30:35,538 --> 00:30:36,579
No.

799
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:39,149
Remove your tapes.

800
00:30:39,149 --> 00:30:41,419
(Jong Kook should never fail.)

801
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:43,948
Why did you fail?

802
00:30:43,948 --> 00:30:45,819
My elbow got in the way.

803
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:47,288
Don't work out too much.

804
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:49,619
It's your lats' fault.

805
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:51,758
(It's because you're so bulky.)

806
00:30:51,758 --> 00:30:53,829
- Your lats got in the way. - Come with me.

807
00:30:53,829 --> 00:30:55,899
(Come with me.)

808
00:30:55,899 --> 00:30:57,028
Good that there are cameras.

809
00:30:57,028 --> 00:30:58,299
There are cameras.

810
00:30:58,299 --> 00:30:59,698
Come with me.

811
00:30:59,698 --> 00:31:00,968
Good that there are cameras.

812
00:31:00,968 --> 00:31:02,299
There are cameras.

813
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:03,799
(Cameras saved my life.)

814
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:06,238
- Why are there cameras everywhere? - There are cameras in the room.

815
00:31:06,238 --> 00:31:07,438
Thank you.

816
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:13,109
Guys, we've been giving you many chances so far.

817
00:31:13,109 --> 00:31:15,518
It's already been 20 minutes.

818
00:31:15,518 --> 00:31:18,119
(A staff member sends a signal.)

819
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:24,788
(Does he mean the laundry mission is completed?)

820
00:31:25,988 --> 00:31:27,698
It's already been 20 minutes.

821
00:31:28,329 --> 00:31:31,998
- I don't think we should continue. - Gosh.

822
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:36,369
(Swarming)

823
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:40,369
- Where are they going? - Where are they going?

824
00:31:40,508 --> 00:31:44,478
(Clueless)

825
00:31:45,248 --> 00:31:48,849
(Let me get my laundry back.)

826
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:52,819
(Seok Jin hasn't said, "Are you doing the laundry?")

827
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:56,859
(They have to take their laundry to the staff now.)

828
00:32:00,488 --> 00:32:04,228
(They have to compete to arrive first.)

829
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:05,569
Gosh.

830
00:32:06,998 --> 00:32:11,069
(It's peaceful on the first floor.)

831
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:14,738
(Jong Kook is busy upstairs.)

832
00:32:14,738 --> 00:32:19,248
(Without Seok Jin noticing anything,)

833
00:32:19,248 --> 00:32:22,819
(Jong Kook arrives at the center.)

834
00:32:23,178 --> 00:32:24,419
Here's my laundry.

835
00:32:25,389 --> 00:32:26,619
It's been 20 minutes.

836
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:28,258
Darn it. I'm late.

837
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:31,228
- Jong Kook, you've succeeded. - Yes.

838
00:32:31,228 --> 00:32:32,528
(Jong Kook fulfills the 2nd step.)

839
00:32:32,528 --> 00:32:33,758
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

840
00:32:34,498 --> 00:32:35,559
That was close.

841
00:32:37,768 --> 00:32:40,968
(Jong Kook completes the laundry mission.)

842
00:32:40,968 --> 00:32:44,438
(Stealing 3 of Seok Jin's items)

843
00:32:44,538 --> 00:32:45,609
Are you ready?

844
00:32:45,609 --> 00:32:47,109
- Yes. - Yes.

845
00:32:47,109 --> 00:32:49,579
- Soyou, please read. - Okay.

846
00:32:50,238 --> 00:32:57,619
(Kwang Soo hurries to the shoes as soon as the mission starts.)

847
00:32:57,849 --> 00:33:03,018
(Where are Seok Jin's shoes?)

848
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,059
Where are you going?

849
00:33:05,928 --> 00:33:07,129
- What? - Where are you going?

850
00:33:07,498 --> 00:33:08,559
Where are you going?

851
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,698
- What? - Where are you going?

852
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:11,899
I wanted to close the door.

853
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:15,268
Let's go.

854
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:17,609
Can we really do this?

855
00:33:17,938 --> 00:33:19,208
- Oh, I'm sorry. - What is this?

856
00:33:19,869 --> 00:33:21,339
(Spilling)

857
00:33:21,339 --> 00:33:22,609
- I'm sorry. - What's with you?

858
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:23,978
I'm sorry.

859
00:33:23,978 --> 00:33:25,708
- It's okay. - I'm sorry.

860
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:28,549
(Give me your wet socks.)

861
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:31,849
(What is she doing?)

862
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:33,819
(I'll try again.)

863
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:37,389
(Kwang Soo goes back to the shoes.)

864
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:38,889
- I'm really okay. - I'm sorry.

865
00:33:38,889 --> 00:33:41,059
(Kwang Soo steals Seok Jin's shoes.)

866
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:43,399
Why are you doing this to me?

867
00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:46,899
You have a bruise on your foot.

868
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:49,198
I don't have a bruise.

869
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:51,609
(She touches his sock.)

870
00:33:52,069 --> 00:33:53,268
(You're so careless.)

871
00:33:53,268 --> 00:33:55,379
You poured coffee on me. It's not even water.

872
00:33:55,379 --> 00:33:57,609
How will you get married when you're so careless?

873
00:33:57,609 --> 00:33:59,379
(You're careless too.)

874
00:33:59,478 --> 00:34:00,919
Let's start, Soyou.

875
00:34:01,018 --> 00:34:04,089
This mission is called Make a Sentence.

876
00:34:04,089 --> 00:34:07,518
If you make a reasonable sentence with 5 words in 5 seconds...

877
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:10,958
in the given order, you clear the mission.

878
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:12,728
(Make a sentence with 5 words in the given order.)

879
00:34:13,058 --> 00:34:14,098
Okay.

880
00:34:14,658 --> 00:34:15,899
All right. Everyone must...

881
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:16,929
- clear this mission. - Shall we switch glasses?

882
00:34:17,328 --> 00:34:18,429
(Suddenly)

883
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:20,169
- I don't look good in them. - Let's switch.

884
00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:21,638
- Come on. - It's Make a Sentence.

885
00:34:21,638 --> 00:34:22,799
I don't look good...

886
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:24,368
- Each person... - with your glasses.

887
00:34:24,368 --> 00:34:25,969
- Let's switch glasses. - It's Make a Sentence.

888
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:27,638
I don't look good with your glasses.

889
00:34:27,638 --> 00:34:30,748
(In the back, someone steals from his bag.)

890
00:34:30,748 --> 00:34:33,308
With five words that are given to you...

891
00:34:34,118 --> 00:34:37,549
(He fishes his bag.)

892
00:34:37,549 --> 00:34:39,788
(Kwang Soo steals Seok Jin's phone.)

893
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:44,589
Make a sentence with 5 given words within 5 seconds.

894
00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:46,958
(Did I feel something?)

895
00:34:48,228 --> 00:34:50,969
I know this game.

896
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:52,699
(His back pockets are full.)

897
00:34:53,328 --> 00:34:54,969
Shall we start with Jae Seok?

898
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:56,138
I'll start.

899
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:58,768
(He takes a peek.)

900
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:01,339
- Give me the words. - Okay.

901
00:35:01,638 --> 00:35:02,808
- Let's start. - All right.

902
00:35:03,438 --> 00:35:05,348
- I can do a good job. - I know.

903
00:35:05,348 --> 00:35:07,078
(Kwang Soo secretly climbs upstairs.)

904
00:35:08,478 --> 00:35:10,379
- Hello. - Hello.

905
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:12,589
Here are Seok Jin's phone and shoes.

906
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:14,489
I brought a pair.

907
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:18,688
(Kwang Soo brings Seok Jin's phone and his shoes.)

908
00:35:18,688 --> 00:35:21,429
The shoes will be counted as one.

909
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:25,469
(What did he say?)

910
00:35:26,098 --> 00:35:27,129
That's it.

911
00:35:27,969 --> 00:35:29,699
(Is this how you'll play?)

912
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:31,169
I also stole the phone case.

913
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:32,638
(How about this?)

914
00:35:33,169 --> 00:35:35,009
I stole his phone and phone case.

915
00:35:35,279 --> 00:35:38,149
As the phone is inside the case,

916
00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:39,578
they'll be counted as one.

917
00:35:39,908 --> 00:35:41,748
I'll take the phone apart.

918
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:45,018
No, you brought two items. Please go back.

919
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,589
(He doesn't meet the criteria.)

920
00:35:48,388 --> 00:35:50,319
- Five seconds? - That's right.

921
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:51,989
- That sounds good. - Count accurately.

922
00:35:52,158 --> 00:35:53,728
Get ready, set, go.

923
00:35:54,328 --> 00:35:57,799
I went to the bathroom for a shoot, and they flogged me.

924
00:35:57,828 --> 00:35:59,728
While I ate some boogers...

925
00:35:59,728 --> 00:36:03,239
(While I ate some boogers...)

926
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:05,768
- Why would you eat boogers? - Why?

927
00:36:05,768 --> 00:36:08,179
- You were good at this game. - That's not why.

928
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:10,379
I wasn't mentally prepared.

929
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:12,279
- Get yourself prepared. - I'm not ready yet.

930
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:14,779
- Let me try again, Soyou. - Who's next?

931
00:36:14,779 --> 00:36:17,018
You got eliminated. You don't get another chance.

932
00:36:17,018 --> 00:36:21,118
(Someone has to steal one more item from Seok Jin.)

933
00:36:21,118 --> 00:36:23,359
- Give me another chance. - Try it, Seok Jin.

934
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,558
(He stands up.)

935
00:36:27,558 --> 00:36:30,529
- Okay. - What's going on?

936
00:36:32,598 --> 00:36:33,598
What?

937
00:36:33,799 --> 00:36:35,569
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

938
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:38,268
You should take off your bag.

939
00:36:39,768 --> 00:36:41,879
- It won't be easy. - By the way...

940
00:36:41,978 --> 00:36:42,978
May I try on your glasses?

941
00:36:42,978 --> 00:36:44,379
(He whispers.)

942
00:36:44,379 --> 00:36:45,949
My glasses? Why?

943
00:36:45,978 --> 00:36:48,078
I want to change mine.

944
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:49,679
- Let's play. - How do I look?

945
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:50,989
- Shall I try it? - Yours are better.

946
00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:52,819
Do I look good? Let me take a look...

947
00:36:52,819 --> 00:36:53,848
- in the mirror. - I'll play.

948
00:36:53,848 --> 00:36:55,219
May I try them on?

949
00:36:55,219 --> 00:36:57,958
There are no lens in the glasses.

950
00:36:58,158 --> 00:37:00,058
What's wrong with him?

951
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,259
Jae Seok.

952
00:37:01,728 --> 00:37:03,259
- Bring them back. - I look good in them.

953
00:37:03,259 --> 00:37:04,768
They look fine but...

954
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:07,598
- All right. - Everyone.

955
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:08,839
Let's play.

956
00:37:09,169 --> 00:37:11,469
- My goodness. - How many sentences...

957
00:37:11,768 --> 00:37:13,708
- Hey. - do we have to make?

958
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,438
Give me your glasses.

959
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:18,279
Give them back.

960
00:37:18,808 --> 00:37:20,308
Hey, Jae Seok?

961
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:26,719
(Jae Seok disappeared.)

962
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:27,958
- Where did he go? - Challenge.

963
00:37:31,888 --> 00:37:32,958
Where did he go?

964
00:37:33,158 --> 00:37:35,228
- Where's Jae Seok? - Have you lost your mind?

965
00:37:35,228 --> 00:37:37,299
Jae Seok disappeared.

966
00:37:37,598 --> 00:37:39,169
- What? - How?

967
00:37:39,169 --> 00:37:40,368
He disappeared.

968
00:37:40,368 --> 00:37:42,598
Why are you calling him?

969
00:37:43,069 --> 00:37:48,708
(He pretends to look at himself in the bathroom mirror.)

970
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:52,348
(He climbs upstairs as fast as possible.)

971
00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:56,449
Give me your glasses.

972
00:37:56,978 --> 00:37:58,188
(Where's the base?)

973
00:37:58,188 --> 00:38:00,018
Where is it?

974
00:38:00,118 --> 00:38:01,859
- Where is it? - Half of you must succeed.

975
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:03,458
Half of us?

976
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:04,458
Okay.

977
00:38:07,259 --> 00:38:11,169
(He enters with pride.)

978
00:38:11,169 --> 00:38:12,998
- Did you bring Seok Jin's item? - Yes.

979
00:38:13,069 --> 00:38:14,638
Kwang Soo succeeded already.

980
00:38:16,368 --> 00:38:17,868
(When did Kwang Soo do it?)

981
00:38:20,538 --> 00:38:23,609
(While Haha was playing the team mission...)

982
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:25,379
My mother-in-law heard my fart.

983
00:38:25,379 --> 00:38:27,348
(He made an attempt.)

984
00:38:29,649 --> 00:38:32,118
(He pretended to fix his microphone...)

985
00:38:32,118 --> 00:38:36,719
(and successfully stole the microphone cover.)

986
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:37,888
This is Seok Jin's microphone cover.

987
00:38:39,788 --> 00:38:40,828
- It's acceptable. - Okay.

988
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:43,529
Thank you.

989
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,529
Thank you.

990
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:45,598
(Kwang Soo cleared the 3rd mission.)

991
00:38:45,969 --> 00:38:47,868
Let's focus, everyone.

992
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:49,239
(The producer gives a signal.)

993
00:38:50,669 --> 00:38:52,538
(The fourth mission is...)

994
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:55,438
(giving food to Seok Jin 4 times without his refusal.)

995
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:59,078
(He gets up.)

996
00:38:59,248 --> 00:39:01,549
Give us the next hint.

997
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:05,248
The four who clear the mission should eat delicious food.

998
00:39:05,248 --> 00:39:07,558
(He makes a suggestion in order to give food to Seok Jin.)

999
00:39:07,558 --> 00:39:08,788
- That sounds good. - Okay.

1000
00:39:09,158 --> 00:39:10,558
- Okay. - Let's do it.

1001
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:12,859
(He doesn't care.)

1002
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:14,359
- That's good. - Whose turn is it?

1003
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:15,799
It's Jong Kook's turn.

1004
00:39:15,799 --> 00:39:16,958
(Everyone is busy deciding the order.)

1005
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:18,469
- It's my turn. - Okay.

1006
00:39:19,169 --> 00:39:20,529
Seok Jin...

1007
00:39:20,529 --> 00:39:25,208
(There's one difficulty to the fourth hidden mission.)

1008
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:28,339
(Seok Jin has a particular taste in food.)

1009
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:33,078
(It'll be difficult to make Seok Jin eat without refusing.)

1010
00:39:33,379 --> 00:39:37,078
(Will they make Seok Jin eat without his refusal?)

1011
00:39:37,518 --> 00:39:38,649
- Try it again. - Let's play.

1012
00:39:38,649 --> 00:39:40,018
I cleared the mission.

1013
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,888
- Get ready. - One.

1014
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:44,089
- Seok Jin. - It's your turn.

1015
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:45,228
(Where are you going?)

1016
00:39:45,228 --> 00:39:47,429
- Get ready. - Get ready.

1017
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:49,658
(He takes a bite from an apple.)

1018
00:39:50,658 --> 00:39:52,699
(For Seok Jin with a particular taste,)

1019
00:39:52,699 --> 00:39:55,598
(Haha offers an apple.)

1020
00:39:56,538 --> 00:39:58,069
- Get ready. - Get ready.

1021
00:39:58,069 --> 00:40:00,069
(It's a good start.)

1022
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:02,739
(Haha is happy.)

1023
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:07,449
(They have 3 food items to go.)

1024
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:09,379
(That was smart of you, Haha.)

1025
00:40:09,379 --> 00:40:10,649
Who else cleared the mission?

1026
00:40:10,649 --> 00:40:14,888
(It's Jong Kook's turn to play Make a Sentence.)

1027
00:40:14,888 --> 00:40:17,629
Get ready, set, go.

1028
00:40:18,228 --> 00:40:19,888
(Wait a minute.)

1029
00:40:19,888 --> 00:40:22,529
(Is that Soo Ae?)

1030
00:40:23,658 --> 00:40:27,598
(A year ago, she approached him like the sunshine.)

1031
00:40:29,138 --> 00:40:31,739
(There was a man next to her.)

1032
00:40:32,109 --> 00:40:34,239
(What do you think of me?)

1033
00:40:34,638 --> 00:40:36,478
(He recalls...)

1034
00:40:36,478 --> 00:40:40,978
(the unforgettable memories he had with her.)

1035
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:44,388
When I saw Soo Ae farting...

1036
00:40:44,388 --> 00:40:45,848
(Soo Ae was farting?)

1037
00:40:45,848 --> 00:40:47,989
I was so surprised and said...

1038
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:49,089
(He makes up something.)

1039
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:51,688
"It's better to fart in shorts."

1040
00:40:51,788 --> 00:40:53,589
- Then I could smell her feet. - That's rude.

1041
00:40:54,629 --> 00:40:56,399
That's a horrible thing to say.

1042
00:40:56,429 --> 00:40:58,228
I'm sorry, Soo Ae.

1043
00:40:58,228 --> 00:40:59,728
- How could you? - I didn't mean it.

1044
00:40:59,728 --> 00:41:00,739
(He feels guilty.)

1045
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:03,768
- Kwang Soo. - I'll do it.

1046
00:41:03,768 --> 00:41:04,768
It's your turn.

1047
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:06,538
- Get ready. - Good luck.

1048
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:10,109
- I can do it. - In 1, 2, 3.

1049
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:12,578
My first kiss was with Jae Seok while watching...

1050
00:41:12,578 --> 00:41:14,379
a horror film.

1051
00:41:14,379 --> 00:41:15,819
(Was his first kiss with Jae Seok?)

1052
00:41:16,078 --> 00:41:19,589
- Our date was at a dump. - What did you say?

1053
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:21,558
- What did you say? - What are you doing?

1054
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:23,359
- What are you doing? - Was that his first kiss?

1055
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,558
Did you kiss Jae Seok? Have you lost your mind?

1056
00:41:25,759 --> 00:41:27,158
- Did you kiss him? - Get out.

1057
00:41:27,658 --> 00:41:29,859
Can't you make better sentences?

1058
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:32,228
- Look. - I'm sorry.

1059
00:41:32,828 --> 00:41:36,239
(Haha prepares for the hidden mission.)

1060
00:41:36,799 --> 00:41:37,969
Did Kwang Soo succeed?

1061
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:39,938
(He prepares a cake, Seok Jin's favorite.)

1062
00:41:40,268 --> 00:41:41,879
Am I the only one who succeeded?

1063
00:41:42,078 --> 00:41:43,879
Let's give it a try.

1064
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:45,879
- Have you played, So Min? - No.

1065
00:41:47,078 --> 00:41:48,578
May I have a bite, Haha?

1066
00:41:49,179 --> 00:41:50,179
Here you go.

1067
00:41:50,179 --> 00:41:51,888
(There's food everywhere.)

1068
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:53,149
Get ready.

1069
00:41:53,489 --> 00:41:55,219
(Give me one bite, Haha.)

1070
00:41:55,489 --> 00:41:56,558
Get ready.

1071
00:41:57,589 --> 00:41:59,859
(She gets to taste some cake.)

1072
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:01,458
It's so delicious.

1073
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:04,098
Seok Jin, it's very delicious.

1074
00:42:04,098 --> 00:42:05,629
(She offers some to Seok Jin.)

1075
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,739
(He should be running low on sugar.)

1076
00:42:11,768 --> 00:42:14,779
(This cake is for you, Seok Jin.)

1077
00:42:16,538 --> 00:42:17,679
He'll refuse to eat right away.

1078
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:22,618
(Will Seok Jin eat the second food item?)

1079
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:26,388
- I'll try one more time. - How many times?

1080
00:42:26,388 --> 00:42:27,859
- I'll try. - You've done too many.

1081
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:28,859
Come on.

1082
00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:30,058
(Come here.)

1083
00:42:30,058 --> 00:42:31,058
Try some.

1084
00:42:31,058 --> 00:42:32,529
(The second food item is in front of him.)

1085
00:42:32,529 --> 00:42:35,058
(If he refuses to eat, they fail the mission.)

1086
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:37,969
(That's right.)

1087
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:39,969
Get ready.

1088
00:42:39,969 --> 00:42:42,069
(He takes a bite of the cake.)

1089
00:42:43,339 --> 00:42:45,609
(It's so delicious.)

1090
00:42:46,538 --> 00:42:48,179
- Goodness. - My goodness.

1091
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:49,779
(2 more food items to go)

1092
00:42:49,779 --> 00:42:52,279
(Haha plans to give him the third food item.)

1093
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:54,819
(It's a chocolate cracker.)

1094
00:42:55,348 --> 00:42:56,719
Why do you keep eating?

1095
00:42:56,978 --> 00:42:58,089
Why do you all keep eating?

1096
00:42:58,089 --> 00:42:59,989
(For Seok Jin,)

1097
00:42:59,989 --> 00:43:02,018
(Haha prepares more sweets.)

1098
00:43:02,658 --> 00:43:06,359
(He gives him a chocolate cracker with whipped cream.)

1099
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:07,658
(As expected,)

1100
00:43:07,658 --> 00:43:09,328
(Seok Jin eats it.)

1101
00:43:09,328 --> 00:43:10,359
It's really good.

1102
00:43:10,728 --> 00:43:12,699
(Haha succeeds 3 times.)

1103
00:43:12,699 --> 00:43:15,239
(Only one food item is left.)

1104
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:16,669
(Everyone starts getting competitive.)

1105
00:43:16,669 --> 00:43:18,609
Hurry up, and play.

1106
00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:21,379
(The person to bring the last food item...)

1107
00:43:21,379 --> 00:43:23,478
(that Seok Jin eats becomes the winner.)

1108
00:43:24,649 --> 00:43:26,279
(They start the competition.)

1109
00:43:27,978 --> 00:43:29,649
(Is someone trying to steal my turn?)

1110
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:32,618
(Kwang Soo offers water...)

1111
00:43:32,618 --> 00:43:35,589
(to Seok Jin who must be thirsty.)

1112
00:43:35,589 --> 00:43:38,259
(Kwang Soo takes his opportunity.)

1113
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:42,158
(If Seok Jin drinks it,)

1114
00:43:42,158 --> 00:43:46,129
(Kwang Soo will earn 20 dollars.)

1115
00:43:48,638 --> 00:43:50,739
(I don't need water.)

1116
00:43:51,569 --> 00:43:55,478
(But Seok Jin didn't explicitly say he didn't want it.)

1117
00:43:55,478 --> 00:43:57,879
(I didn't expect him to refuse to drink water.)

1118
00:43:58,848 --> 00:44:02,248
(Kwang Soo's strategy fails.)

1119
00:44:02,248 --> 00:44:04,348
(I'll bring an end to this game.)

1120
00:44:05,118 --> 00:44:09,819
(Haha prepares coffee and chocolate crackers.)

1121
00:44:12,688 --> 00:44:14,699
- It tastes so good. - What are you eating?

1122
00:44:16,598 --> 00:44:17,728
Try this.

1123
00:44:17,728 --> 00:44:19,799
(Seok Jin would definitely want to try.)

1124
00:44:19,799 --> 00:44:24,438
(Will Haha's final try succeed?)

1125
00:44:24,438 --> 00:44:27,509
I'm okay. I'm on a diet.

1126
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:29,578
(Laughing)

1127
00:44:29,638 --> 00:44:31,009
I don't eat a lot of sweets.

1128
00:44:31,908 --> 00:44:35,449
(He doesn't want it.)

1129
00:44:35,618 --> 00:44:37,018
I don't eat a lot of sweets.

1130
00:44:37,018 --> 00:44:39,149
(The mission fails.)

1131
00:44:40,188 --> 00:44:43,989
(Seok Jin doesn't eat a lot as always.)

1132
00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:45,558
(Funny)

1133
00:44:45,688 --> 00:44:46,888
I want some water.

1134
00:44:47,998 --> 00:44:50,029
- I'm so thirsty. - Drink this.

1135
00:44:50,029 --> 00:44:51,368
(Haha never gives up.)

1136
00:44:51,368 --> 00:44:52,828
- I want cold water. - No, this is better.

1137
00:44:52,828 --> 00:44:54,268
That water smells bad.

1138
00:44:54,339 --> 00:44:57,969
That water is not cold.

1139
00:44:59,408 --> 00:45:02,138
(That was so close.)

1140
00:45:02,138 --> 00:45:04,509
(The food mission fails.)

1141
00:45:04,509 --> 00:45:08,848
(Now, they have to peel 5 onions without Seok Jin saying, "onions".)

1142
00:45:09,419 --> 00:45:10,848
(The onion mission starts.)

1143
00:45:10,848 --> 00:45:12,188
- That was close. - Right?

1144
00:45:12,188 --> 00:45:13,288
That was close.

1145
00:45:13,288 --> 00:45:14,688
I want to try too.

1146
00:45:14,859 --> 00:45:16,558
The water is not cold.

1147
00:45:18,688 --> 00:45:19,989
(So Min searches for onions.)

1148
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:21,029
I want cold water.

1149
00:45:21,029 --> 00:45:22,098
One, two, three.

1150
00:45:22,098 --> 00:45:25,328
(I'll have onions ready.)

1151
00:45:25,728 --> 00:45:28,138
There's a knife. We can eat apples.

1152
00:45:28,669 --> 00:45:29,699
It's so hot.

1153
00:45:30,808 --> 00:45:31,839
Where are the tissues?

1154
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:33,739
(Seok Jin goes into the bathroom.)

1155
00:45:35,078 --> 00:45:40,078
(So Min goes to the room on the other side with onions.)

1156
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:45,089
(She is in a safe zone now.)

1157
00:45:45,149 --> 00:45:47,419
I better hurry. I have to succeed this time.

1158
00:45:49,688 --> 00:45:50,929
(Everyone gets ready to peel onions.)

1159
00:45:50,929 --> 00:45:51,989
It's so hot.

1160
00:45:51,989 --> 00:45:53,328
(Everyone gets ready to peel onions.)

1161
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:57,498
(Ji Hyo goes upstairs.)

1162
00:45:57,498 --> 00:46:00,069
(I'll be here.)

1163
00:46:01,299 --> 00:46:04,868
(It might be safer near Seok Jin.)

1164
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:10,609
(Guys, here I come.)

1165
00:46:12,379 --> 00:46:15,449
(I almost got caught. I have to hide the onions.)

1166
00:46:16,248 --> 00:46:19,219
(If Seok Jin says, "onions", the mission fails.)

1167
00:46:19,219 --> 00:46:20,989
Where is everybody again?

1168
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:24,489
Fail. The mission failed. Everybody, come here.

1169
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:25,589
Come here.

1170
00:46:26,058 --> 00:46:27,859
- Come here, guys. - Come here.

1171
00:46:27,859 --> 00:46:29,929
- I'm getting angry. Come here. - Jong Kook.

1172
00:46:29,929 --> 00:46:30,998
(I won't let others succeed.)

1173
00:46:31,598 --> 00:46:32,969
Come here.

1174
00:46:32,969 --> 00:46:34,598
(Se Chan finds So Min.)

1175
00:46:34,598 --> 00:46:36,638
Are we doing something? Gosh.

1176
00:46:36,739 --> 00:46:37,739
Hold on.

1177
00:46:37,739 --> 00:46:38,839
(Everyone comes back.)

1178
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:41,339
- Let's do that. - We'll have to see crocodiles.

1179
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:42,509
I'm fine with whatever.

1180
00:46:42,609 --> 00:46:44,279
- All right. - For now,

1181
00:46:44,408 --> 00:46:47,348
- no one has succeeded. - It's hard.

1182
00:46:47,348 --> 00:46:49,348
You had some snacks,

1183
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,089
- but you must be getting hungry. - What?

1184
00:46:51,248 --> 00:46:54,359
You can order some noodles.

1185
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:55,558
Noodles?

1186
00:46:55,558 --> 00:46:57,688
Do we have to choose the same dish?

1187
00:46:57,688 --> 00:46:59,688
- No. You can choose whatever. - Whatever?

1188
00:46:59,688 --> 00:47:02,458
- Why don't we... - I've done this before...

1189
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:03,899
- Where are you going? - Where are you going?

1190
00:47:03,899 --> 00:47:05,828
- Where are you going? - I'm going to the bathroom.

1191
00:47:05,828 --> 00:47:07,268
No. You have to stay.

1192
00:47:07,268 --> 00:47:09,169
- Choose a dish first. - Sit down.

1193
00:47:09,169 --> 00:47:11,069
Does he need a diaper?

1194
00:47:11,069 --> 00:47:13,908
(He's been to the bathroom so many times.)

1195
00:47:13,908 --> 00:47:15,839
(Well said.)

1196
00:47:16,179 --> 00:47:17,208
What would you like?

1197
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:18,908
- I'd like... - I'll order a jjamppong.

1198
00:47:18,908 --> 00:47:20,549
- Me too. - Me too.

1199
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:21,919
(Everyone is choosing a dish.)

1200
00:47:21,919 --> 00:47:23,848
- I'd like fried rice. - I'm not kidding.

1201
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:26,748
(I have to go to the bathroom too.)

1202
00:47:26,748 --> 00:47:27,859
My stomach hurts.

1203
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:29,058
Come back.

1204
00:47:29,058 --> 00:47:30,058
- So Min. - Come back.

1205
00:47:30,058 --> 00:47:31,359
Come back.

1206
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,759
See who orders what.

1207
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:36,458
Come back. Where are you going?

1208
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:37,498
So Min, come back.

1209
00:47:37,498 --> 00:47:39,699
- What are you guys doing? - Soyou is here.

1210
00:47:39,699 --> 00:47:41,739
- I really have to poop. - Come back.

1211
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:43,868
- You have to poop? - Come back.

1212
00:47:43,969 --> 00:47:45,469
- She has to poop. - Come back.

1213
00:47:45,469 --> 00:47:47,638
- Can't I even poop? - I'm getting angry.

1214
00:47:47,638 --> 00:47:49,978
Respect human rights.

1215
00:47:51,009 --> 00:47:52,179
My stomach hurts.

1216
00:47:52,179 --> 00:47:53,449
(Se Chan sneaks into the kitchen.)

1217
00:47:53,449 --> 00:47:54,949
Why is everyone so distracted?

1218
00:47:56,379 --> 00:47:58,149
Why is everyone so distracted?

1219
00:47:58,848 --> 00:48:05,489
(Seok Jin notices Se Chan missing. Will the mission fail?)

1220
00:48:05,489 --> 00:48:07,259
We should order sweet and sour pork.

1221
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,399
(We should order sweet and sour pork.)

1222
00:48:09,558 --> 00:48:11,098
We should order it.

1223
00:48:11,399 --> 00:48:12,469
I want fried rice.

1224
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,399
(That was close.)

1225
00:48:16,368 --> 00:48:18,438
(Se Chan makes a brave attempt.)

1226
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:20,169
Try here.

1227
00:48:21,609 --> 00:48:23,239
- Jjamppong... - Jjamppong and jajangmyeon?

1228
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:24,449
(It might be safer here.)

1229
00:48:24,449 --> 00:48:25,549
Can I order both jjamppong and jajangmyeon?

1230
00:48:25,808 --> 00:48:27,179
(Se Chan starts to peel onions.)

1231
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:28,478
I'm craving jjamppong though.

1232
00:48:28,478 --> 00:48:30,549
It'll be hard for Soyou to remember.

1233
00:48:31,348 --> 00:48:32,788
(Focused)

1234
00:48:32,788 --> 00:48:34,419
What are you doing, Se Chan?

1235
00:48:34,419 --> 00:48:35,989
(Interrupting)

1236
00:48:35,989 --> 00:48:38,859
(Se Chan is unexpectedly interrupted by Jae Seok.)

1237
00:48:38,859 --> 00:48:42,828
(Will Seok Jin notice?)

1238
00:48:43,498 --> 00:48:44,998
What are you doing, Se Chan?

1239
00:48:44,998 --> 00:48:46,498
(Dangerous)

1240
00:48:46,498 --> 00:48:47,938
What about you?

1241
00:48:47,938 --> 00:48:49,399
(Jong Kook helps Se Chan out.)

1242
00:48:49,399 --> 00:48:52,069
(Choose what you want to eat.)

1243
00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:53,368
- What about you? - I'll have seafood rice.

1244
00:48:53,669 --> 00:48:54,908
- Seafood rice? - Yes.

1245
00:48:54,908 --> 00:48:56,279
- You can order anything. - Anything?

1246
00:48:56,279 --> 00:48:57,748
- I'll have seafood rice. - I'll have jjamppong.

1247
00:48:59,748 --> 00:49:02,919
- Let's do this. - Why are you sitting in one line?

1248
00:49:02,919 --> 00:49:04,419
(Jong Kook covers Se Chan.)

1249
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:05,819
- Order anything. - Okay.

1250
00:49:06,288 --> 00:49:08,658
Se Chan, you're hiding behind Jong Kook.

1251
00:49:09,589 --> 00:49:11,288
- You're holding onto him. - I have his back.

1252
00:49:11,288 --> 00:49:12,828
Obviously.

1253
00:49:13,058 --> 00:49:14,399
I'll be hiding behind his back.

1254
00:49:15,098 --> 00:49:16,759
You're glued to him.

1255
00:49:17,629 --> 00:49:18,699
What?

1256
00:49:18,699 --> 00:49:19,768
(Sneaking)

1257
00:49:19,768 --> 00:49:21,368
What did you say, Ji Hyo?

1258
00:49:21,368 --> 00:49:23,438
(Everyone is distracted.)

1259
00:49:23,438 --> 00:49:25,438
- So Min. - You can order anything.

1260
00:49:25,438 --> 00:49:27,609
(Where are you going, So Min?)

1261
00:49:28,538 --> 00:49:32,279
(I have something to do.)

1262
00:49:35,449 --> 00:49:38,089
(Will So Min win?)

1263
00:49:38,089 --> 00:49:41,759
(Will Se Chan's brave attempt pay off?)

1264
00:49:41,759 --> 00:49:43,518
(My eyes are burning.)

1265
00:49:43,788 --> 00:49:45,429
- Where is my name tag? - Hey.

1266
00:49:46,489 --> 00:49:48,899
- What is this smell? - Where is my name tag?

1267
00:49:50,299 --> 00:49:51,328
(Looking around)

1268
00:49:51,328 --> 00:49:53,098
(Covering up)

1269
00:49:53,828 --> 00:49:56,498
(Jong Kook's back is working hard.)

1270
00:49:57,669 --> 00:49:59,038
- I'll have jjamppong rice. - Seok Jin.

1271
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:00,438
Where is So Min?

1272
00:50:00,638 --> 00:50:03,739
- So Min! - Just a second. My stomach hurts.

1273
00:50:05,509 --> 00:50:07,348
I'm usually good at peeling onions.

1274
00:50:07,449 --> 00:50:08,748
Why am I so slow?

1275
00:50:09,518 --> 00:50:10,649
Gosh, my eyes.

1276
00:50:11,288 --> 00:50:13,089
(Her eyes ache more than her stomach.)

1277
00:50:13,089 --> 00:50:14,219
They're burning.

1278
00:50:14,788 --> 00:50:17,288
(Who will be the winner?)

1279
00:50:17,388 --> 00:50:18,489
Gosh, my eyes.

1280
00:50:18,658 --> 00:50:20,458
(She's done peeling 5 onions.)

1281
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:23,828
(She has to take the onions to the staff now.)

1282
00:50:25,929 --> 00:50:27,638
(I'm watching you.)

1283
00:50:28,368 --> 00:50:31,069
(What are you doing there?)

1284
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:33,038
(She leaves the onions in the corner.)

1285
00:50:33,038 --> 00:50:34,708
The thing is...

1286
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:37,408
(Seok Jin looks around the room.)

1287
00:50:37,408 --> 00:50:39,078
(What is going on?)

1288
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:40,279
Why are you crying?

1289
00:50:40,379 --> 00:50:41,549
What are you doing?

1290
00:50:41,549 --> 00:50:43,549
My eyes are...

1291
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:47,049
- Why are you crying? - Why is everyone crying?

1292
00:50:47,049 --> 00:50:48,188
(The onions made me cry.)

1293
00:50:48,188 --> 00:50:49,319
Why are you crying?

1294
00:50:49,458 --> 00:50:51,629
My stomach ached so much.

1295
00:50:52,129 --> 00:50:53,259
Did you cry?

1296
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:54,958
Did you poop so much that you cried?

1297
00:50:56,259 --> 00:50:58,299
(Poor So Min.)

1298
00:50:59,828 --> 00:51:02,669
(Seok Jin doesn't seem to suspect anything.)

1299
00:51:02,669 --> 00:51:06,808
(So Min starts once again.)

1300
00:51:08,538 --> 00:51:10,478
(She runs upstairs with 5 onions under her shirt.)

1301
00:51:10,478 --> 00:51:12,908
- Where are you going? - Just a second.

1302
00:51:12,908 --> 00:51:15,149
You should have done it at home.

1303
00:51:16,478 --> 00:51:19,549
(I'm almost there.)

1304
00:51:19,549 --> 00:51:22,018
My stomach aches so much.

1305
00:51:23,888 --> 00:51:25,728
- Here. - Do you have them?

1306
00:51:25,728 --> 00:51:27,188
Yes, there are five of them.

1307
00:51:28,598 --> 00:51:30,768
- Are there five of them? - Yes, count them.

1308
00:51:30,828 --> 00:51:32,069
- There are five, right? - Yes.

1309
00:51:32,498 --> 00:51:33,629
But...

1310
00:51:33,629 --> 00:51:36,169
(But)

1311
00:51:36,169 --> 00:51:37,469
Se Chan was here first.

1312
00:51:40,009 --> 00:51:42,208
- When was he here? - Just a moment ago.

1313
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:44,478
(Se Chan completed the mission before So Min.)

1314
00:51:46,848 --> 00:51:47,879
Gosh.

1315
00:51:47,879 --> 00:51:48,919
(When was he here?)

1316
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,219
(Se Chan finished peeling the onions before So Min.)

1317
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:58,958
(He watched Seok Jin from the bathroom.)

1318
00:51:59,728 --> 00:52:01,299
Did I drop my phone somewhere?

1319
00:52:02,558 --> 00:52:07,839
(While Seok Jin was looking for his phone, Se Chan went upstairs.)

1320
00:52:09,299 --> 00:52:11,109
- How many do you have? - Five.

1321
00:52:11,538 --> 00:52:15,879
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1322
00:52:15,879 --> 00:52:16,908
You've succeeded.

1323
00:52:16,908 --> 00:52:19,208
(Se Chan has completed the mission.)

1324
00:52:20,379 --> 00:52:22,179
(The screaming mission fails.)

1325
00:52:22,179 --> 00:52:24,018
- Seok Jin! - Be quiet.

1326
00:52:25,018 --> 00:52:27,219
Is it really okay?

1327
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:30,158
I feel so bad for Soyou.

1328
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:31,529
It's okay.

1329
00:52:31,529 --> 00:52:34,129
(A pace counter?)

1330
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:38,629
(Taking 7,000 steps without Seok Jin saying, "Stay still.")

1331
00:52:39,498 --> 00:52:41,438
(This is the last chance.)

1332
00:52:41,438 --> 00:52:42,669
Why don't we dance?

1333
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,009
(Taking 7,000 steps without Seok Jin saying, "Stay still.")

1334
00:52:45,009 --> 00:52:46,239
Let's dance.

1335
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:47,779
- We're sorry. - It's okay.

1336
00:52:48,138 --> 00:52:49,938
(What will they do?)

1337
00:52:49,938 --> 00:52:51,649
Is there a bathroom without any cameras?

1338
00:52:51,808 --> 00:52:53,348
- My goodness. - Haha.

1339
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:55,848
Do you have to use the bathroom? Go upstairs.

1340
00:52:56,149 --> 00:52:57,848
- Is there a bathroom? - Yes.

1341
00:52:57,848 --> 00:52:59,688
- I have to go to the bathroom. - Me too.

1342
00:53:00,618 --> 00:53:02,288
It doesn't have any cameras?

1343
00:53:02,288 --> 00:53:04,529
- It doesn't have any cameras. - There are no cameras.

1344
00:53:04,529 --> 00:53:06,359
(Let's use the bathroom without any cameras.)

1345
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:07,899
- There are no cameras? - Cameras are everywhere.

1346
00:53:07,899 --> 00:53:09,629
- You go first. - Okay.

1347
00:53:09,629 --> 00:53:10,828
There's just one camera?

1348
00:53:10,828 --> 00:53:13,929
(Seok Jin uses the bathroom first.)

1349
00:53:15,969 --> 00:53:17,199
I'll cover the camera.

1350
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:18,339
(He covers the camera with a towel.)

1351
00:53:18,669 --> 00:53:21,038
(Jae Seok is carrying out the mission.)

1352
00:53:23,279 --> 00:53:25,679
(Everyone except Se Chan, Jong Kook, and Kwang Soo has no money.)

1353
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:27,348
Seok Jin, hurry.

1354
00:53:27,419 --> 00:53:29,649
Soyou, we're sorry.

1355
00:53:30,049 --> 00:53:31,388
We're sorry.

1356
00:53:31,388 --> 00:53:32,788
Come back.

1357
00:53:32,788 --> 00:53:34,018
Is Soyou aware of it?

1358
00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:35,989
You're not aware of anything, are you?

1359
00:53:35,989 --> 00:53:37,018
(Do you know what we're doing?)

1360
00:53:37,018 --> 00:53:38,458
It's so obvious.

1361
00:53:39,529 --> 00:53:40,728
(Seok Jin has no idea.)

1362
00:53:40,728 --> 00:53:42,129
- What is with Seok Jin? - We're really sorry.

1363
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:43,399
It's okay.

1364
00:53:43,958 --> 00:53:48,598
(The spirits gave him a big nose but no wits.)

1365
00:53:50,638 --> 00:53:52,208
- Is there a restroom? - Yes.

1366
00:53:52,208 --> 00:53:54,879
You can cover the camera with a towel. Cover it.

1367
00:53:54,879 --> 00:53:56,779
(Jae Seok pretends like he has to use the restroom.)

1368
00:53:56,779 --> 00:53:59,109
Make sure this doesn't turn off. Can you do it for me?

1369
00:53:59,408 --> 00:54:02,078
I can't do it. Let me know once you pass the 7,000 point.

1370
00:54:02,078 --> 00:54:05,049
Can you do it for me? You have to keep going. Do it properly.

1371
00:54:05,388 --> 00:54:06,719
It's 621 right now.

1372
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:08,419
- I have to reach 7,000. - 7,000?

1373
00:54:08,419 --> 00:54:09,419
Yes.

1374
00:54:09,419 --> 00:54:11,129
(Is this why he followed Seok Jin to the restroom?)

1375
00:54:12,328 --> 00:54:14,228
Let's get rolling. Seok Jin is back.

1376
00:54:14,228 --> 00:54:16,598
- The light was off. - No, I covered it with a towel.

1377
00:54:16,799 --> 00:54:19,429
(They shake the pace counter discreetly.)

1378
00:54:19,429 --> 00:54:20,529
My legs are sore.

1379
00:54:20,529 --> 00:54:23,438
The light was off though. Why did they put a camera there?

1380
00:54:23,438 --> 00:54:26,138
(So Min tries a new strategy.)

1381
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:27,478
(Pace counter spirits, please help me.)

1382
00:54:27,478 --> 00:54:28,509
Jae Seok.

1383
00:54:28,509 --> 00:54:31,078
- Come back. - Jae Seok.

1384
00:54:32,449 --> 00:54:34,748
What are you doing?

1385
00:54:35,419 --> 00:54:36,419
Seok Jin.

1386
00:54:37,888 --> 00:54:38,888
7,000?

1387
00:54:38,888 --> 00:54:40,388
(They all try to shake it more near the end.)

1388
00:54:40,388 --> 00:54:41,888
We'll get started, everybody.

1389
00:54:42,259 --> 00:54:43,419
- All right. - Keep doing it.

1390
00:54:43,419 --> 00:54:45,058
Why is he taking so long?

1391
00:54:45,058 --> 00:54:46,688
Keep doing it, Kwon Ryeol.

1392
00:54:46,688 --> 00:54:48,498
Can you do it until I come back?

1393
00:54:48,498 --> 00:54:50,299
(He passes it onto Kwon Ryeol and gets back.)

1394
00:54:50,598 --> 00:54:52,268
Please get back, everybody.

1395
00:54:52,899 --> 00:54:55,299
(He has 2 jobs because of their 7-year friendship.)

1396
00:54:55,299 --> 00:54:56,339
Yes.

1397
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:02,239
This mission is called Rock-Scissors-Paper.

1398
00:55:04,248 --> 00:55:07,109
I'll play rock-scissors-paper with you in a row.

1399
00:55:07,109 --> 00:55:09,279
We'll play rock-scissors-paper,

1400
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:11,089
- and the four of you... - Half and half?

1401
00:55:11,089 --> 00:55:13,388
Half of you has to win, and the other half has to lose...

1402
00:55:13,449 --> 00:55:15,458
to win the mission.

1403
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:16,458
(Shaking)

1404
00:55:17,388 --> 00:55:21,998
(They have to complete 7,000 steps during this game.)

1405
00:55:21,998 --> 00:55:25,399
- I've played this before. - Let's do this.

1406
00:55:25,629 --> 00:55:27,368
- Let's do this. - Please stand in a line.

1407
00:55:27,368 --> 00:55:29,098
- Stand in a line? - Seok Jin can go first.

1408
00:55:29,098 --> 00:55:31,169
Please make a line. Seok Jin, go first.

1409
00:55:31,169 --> 00:55:32,438
- Okay. I'll go first. - Okay.

1410
00:55:32,438 --> 00:55:34,009
I'll go first. Rock-scissors-paper?

1411
00:55:34,578 --> 00:55:36,509
(Yes, I'm doing it.)

1412
00:55:37,308 --> 00:55:38,308
(But I gave up on filming you.)

1413
00:55:38,308 --> 00:55:39,509
(Shaking)

1414
00:55:39,509 --> 00:55:42,618
It doesn't matter whether I win or lose.

1415
00:55:42,618 --> 00:55:44,618
- Rock-scissors-paper - Rock-scissors-paper

1416
00:55:44,618 --> 00:55:45,618
- Rock-scissors-paper - Rock-scissors-paper

1417
00:55:45,788 --> 00:55:48,018
(Seok Jin wins.)

1418
00:55:48,018 --> 00:55:49,658
- I won. - He won.

1419
00:55:49,658 --> 00:55:50,859
- It's better for me to lose, right? - Right.

1420
00:55:50,859 --> 00:55:52,288
It's better to alternate.

1421
00:55:52,288 --> 00:55:55,359
- Rock-scissors-paper - Rock-scissors-paper

1422
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:56,359
(Jae Seok loses.)

1423
00:55:56,359 --> 00:55:57,998
- I lost. - Good. You have to win.

1424
00:55:57,998 --> 00:55:59,399
- You have to win. - I have to win?

1425
00:55:59,399 --> 00:56:00,529
- Rock-scissors-paper - Rock-scissors-paper

1426
00:56:00,529 --> 00:56:01,538
(So Min versus Soyou)

1427
00:56:01,739 --> 00:56:03,138
- Rock-scissors-paper - Rock-scissors-paper

1428
00:56:03,368 --> 00:56:04,808
(So Min wins.)

1429
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:06,438
- It's better to win, right? - You have to lose, Kwang Soo.

1430
00:56:06,438 --> 00:56:07,679
- You have to lose. - I got it.

1431
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:09,078
Let's keep alternating.

1432
00:56:09,078 --> 00:56:10,978
If we win this mission, it's the end.

1433
00:56:10,978 --> 00:56:12,049
It's your turn, Kwang Soo.

1434
00:56:12,348 --> 00:56:14,879
(I'll beat you, Soyou.)

1435
00:56:16,518 --> 00:56:18,419
- Rock-scissors-paper - What are you going to play?

1436
00:56:19,149 --> 00:56:21,989
(Just tell me, Kwang Soo.)

1437
00:56:21,989 --> 00:56:23,388
(His heart flutters.)

1438
00:56:24,029 --> 00:56:25,359
Please don't do that.

1439
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:28,259
- She's shaking him up. - It'll melt him.

1440
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:30,929
I'm going to play scissors.

1441
00:56:30,969 --> 00:56:33,469
Scissors? Scissors?

1442
00:56:33,469 --> 00:56:35,699
(It's better for him to lose. Will he show his true feelings?)

1443
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:37,609
- Kwang Soo. - Are you going to lose?

1444
00:56:37,609 --> 00:56:39,138
Come on.

1445
00:56:39,138 --> 00:56:42,609
(It's a dilemma between love and the game.)

1446
00:56:42,609 --> 00:56:46,708
(This is a dilemma between work and friendship.)

1447
00:56:48,219 --> 00:56:51,348
(Haha runs to the 2nd floor all of a sudden.)

1448
00:56:53,089 --> 00:56:55,288
(Let me check something.)

1449
00:56:55,288 --> 00:56:58,259
You can't do that. I did that.

1450
00:56:58,288 --> 00:56:59,288
You can't.

1451
00:56:59,288 --> 00:57:00,589
(He tries to reset Jae Seok's counter.)

1452
00:57:01,429 --> 00:57:04,498
(It's the Running Man spirit to rain on somebody else's parade.)

1453
00:57:04,498 --> 00:57:06,469
Hey, come here.

1454
00:57:07,098 --> 00:57:11,138
(The two cheaters are fighting.)

1455
00:57:11,138 --> 00:57:12,169
Come here.

1456
00:57:12,438 --> 00:57:13,509
(Do you want to die?)

1457
00:57:13,509 --> 00:57:15,739
I'm going to kill you.

1458
00:57:16,609 --> 00:57:17,908
Get back and play rock-scissors-paper.

1459
00:57:18,408 --> 00:57:20,208
- I'll go. - Hurry.

1460
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:21,248
Go.

1461
00:57:21,248 --> 00:57:22,248
(Go away, you petty thief.)

1462
00:57:22,949 --> 00:57:25,388
That was close. He was going to reset it, right?

1463
00:57:26,188 --> 00:57:27,288
He almost reset it.

1464
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:30,319
Scissors? Are you going to play scissors?

1465
00:57:30,589 --> 00:57:31,788
Rock-scissors-paper

1466
00:57:32,188 --> 00:57:33,388
- What? - Nothing.

1467
00:57:33,388 --> 00:57:35,529
- Rock-scissors-paper - Rock-scissors-paper

1468
00:57:35,529 --> 00:57:37,158
Rock-scissors-paper

1469
00:57:37,598 --> 00:57:38,598
(Kwang Soo wins.)

1470
00:57:38,598 --> 00:57:39,728
- Okay. - Okay.

1471
00:57:39,728 --> 00:57:41,339
Two of you have to win.

1472
00:57:41,998 --> 00:57:43,638
- Do we only have 1 loss to go? - 2 more people have to win.

1473
00:57:43,638 --> 00:57:45,069
- You have to lose. - Let's go.

1474
00:57:45,138 --> 00:57:47,069
Let's go!

1475
00:57:47,069 --> 00:57:49,408
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1476
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:50,808
- Do I have to lose? - Let's go!

1477
00:57:50,808 --> 00:57:51,879
Do I have to lose?

1478
00:57:51,879 --> 00:57:53,078
(He earned 20 dollars already, so he wants to get out of here.)

1479
00:57:53,078 --> 00:57:54,819
- Please win! - He has to lose.

1480
00:57:54,819 --> 00:57:56,748
- Please lose. - He has to lose?

1481
00:57:57,419 --> 00:57:58,919
- Okay. - Rock-scissors-paper

1482
00:57:58,919 --> 00:58:00,888
(Jong Kook loses.)

1483
00:58:01,518 --> 00:58:02,518
- Oh, dear. - Okay.

1484
00:58:02,518 --> 00:58:04,328
- That's good. - Did you lose?

1485
00:58:04,328 --> 00:58:06,728
- Did you lose? - It's 3 to 2 now.

1486
00:58:06,788 --> 00:58:08,759
- 3 to 2. - Rock-scissors-paper

1487
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:10,359
(Se Chan loses as well.)

1488
00:58:10,359 --> 00:58:12,399
- Okay. - Okay.

1489
00:58:12,399 --> 00:58:14,538
(Seok Jin and those who won the mission are happy.)

1490
00:58:14,538 --> 00:58:16,169
We can go out.

1491
00:58:16,169 --> 00:58:18,169
- It's 3 to 3. - We have hope.

1492
00:58:18,339 --> 00:58:20,308
- This is over. - It's 3 to 3?

1493
00:58:20,368 --> 00:58:22,279
I'm so nervous. In 1, 2, 3.

1494
00:58:22,279 --> 00:58:24,748
- It doesn't matter what you play. - Rock-scissors-paper

1495
00:58:25,109 --> 00:58:26,449
(Ji Hyo wins.)

1496
00:58:26,449 --> 00:58:27,449
- I won. - You have to lose now.

1497
00:58:27,449 --> 00:58:28,779
You have to lose, Haha.

1498
00:58:28,779 --> 00:58:30,219
If you lose, this is over. We can get out.

1499
00:58:30,219 --> 00:58:31,788
- Everybody. - You have to lose.

1500
00:58:31,788 --> 00:58:33,388
If he loses, the mission is over.

1501
00:58:33,388 --> 00:58:34,888
- Okay. - Please.

1502
00:58:34,888 --> 00:58:37,118
- What is it? He has to lose, right? - Let's do this.

1503
00:58:37,118 --> 00:58:39,228
- If he loses, the mission is over. - It's done, right?

1504
00:58:39,228 --> 00:58:41,058
- It'll be finished. - The mission will be over.

1505
00:58:41,058 --> 00:58:42,598
- It's done. - Really?

1506
00:58:43,498 --> 00:58:44,768
- Hey. - Finish it off.

1507
00:58:44,998 --> 00:58:46,228
- Finish it. - Haha.

1508
00:58:46,498 --> 00:58:48,098
- Think about this carefully. - Finish it.

1509
00:58:48,098 --> 00:58:49,998
- You have to lose. - It'll end.

1510
00:58:49,998 --> 00:58:51,268
- Really? - It's not up to me.

1511
00:58:51,268 --> 00:58:52,268
(Should I win or lose? That is the question.)

1512
00:58:52,268 --> 00:58:53,339
(He has to lose so that everybody gets to go to Bora Bora.)

1513
00:58:53,339 --> 00:58:54,509
You have to lose.

1514
00:58:54,509 --> 00:58:57,609
(He has to lose so that everybody gets to go to Bora Bora.)

1515
00:58:58,208 --> 00:58:59,348
- Rock-scissors-paper - Rock-scissors-paper

1516
00:58:59,348 --> 00:59:04,649
(If he wins, they get to earn more mission money.)

1517
00:59:04,649 --> 00:59:08,167
(Will the Race of Wits favor this mission or the hidden one?)

1518
00:59:08,192 --> 00:59:09,832
(He loses.)

1519
00:59:12,172 --> 00:59:14,471
The mission is over.

1520
00:59:14,871 --> 00:59:17,571
(I get no more mission money.)

1521
00:59:18,612 --> 00:59:19,841
It's done.

1522
00:59:19,841 --> 00:59:21,542
- Is it? - It is.

1523
00:59:21,542 --> 00:59:22,612
(The Race of Wits is now over.)

1524
00:59:23,812 --> 00:59:26,352
Do we get to go? Is this over?

1525
00:59:27,112 --> 00:59:29,721
Thank me.

1526
00:59:29,821 --> 00:59:31,721
Is this over? Do we get to go?

1527
00:59:31,721 --> 00:59:33,352
We do.

1528
00:59:33,352 --> 00:59:35,192
This is the second part of Half and Half Tour.

1529
00:59:35,192 --> 00:59:38,292
You have won the group mission that was the deciding factor...

1530
00:59:38,292 --> 00:59:41,801
for a trip destination for the tour.

1531
00:59:41,801 --> 00:59:44,132
- Okay. - Running Man wins.

1532
00:59:44,132 --> 00:59:45,902
(Running Man wins the race.)

1533
00:59:46,732 --> 00:59:49,301
On the roulette, we'll add Bora Bora...

1534
00:59:49,301 --> 00:59:51,301
as one of the possible final destinations.

1535
00:59:51,301 --> 00:59:52,442
- Yes. - Yes.

1536
00:59:52,442 --> 00:59:54,741
- Let's have a seat. - Let's sit. Oh, dear.

1537
00:59:55,641 --> 00:59:57,411
The mission is now over.

1538
00:59:57,411 --> 01:00:00,152
Let's calculate the mission money...

1539
01:00:00,152 --> 01:00:03,152
you have earned during the missions.

1540
01:00:03,422 --> 01:00:04,451
Mission money?

1541
01:00:04,451 --> 01:00:05,852
(There was mission money?)

1542
01:00:06,221 --> 01:00:09,661
Jong Kook, Kwang Soo, and Se Chan...

1543
01:00:10,022 --> 01:00:11,792
passed the mission, so you each earn 20 dollars.

1544
01:00:11,792 --> 01:00:13,562
(They earn 20 dollars for deceiving Seok Jin.)

1545
01:00:13,562 --> 01:00:15,902
(What did they win?)

1546
01:00:16,232 --> 01:00:17,531
We're a team.

1547
01:00:18,332 --> 01:00:20,132
- We're your team. - The rest of you...

1548
01:00:20,132 --> 01:00:22,801
have failed the mission, so Seok Jin...

1549
01:00:23,141 --> 01:00:25,812
wins 30 dollars, 10 dollars from each person.

1550
01:00:26,741 --> 01:00:28,942
Race of Wits: Deceive Seok Jin...

1551
01:00:30,582 --> 01:00:32,781
- This mission is over now. - Yes.

1552
01:00:32,852 --> 01:00:34,252
What did you say?

1553
01:00:35,721 --> 01:00:37,451
- "What did you say?" - I feel...

1554
01:00:37,451 --> 01:00:39,451
so sorry towards Soyou too.

1555
01:00:39,451 --> 01:00:40,451
Hold on.

1556
01:00:40,852 --> 01:00:44,292
We had seven levels of mission...

1557
01:00:44,422 --> 01:00:46,332
before we got here.

1558
01:00:46,332 --> 01:00:47,832
- Related to me? - Yes.

1559
01:00:47,832 --> 01:00:49,602
- Is that why it was chaotic today? - Right.

1560
01:00:49,602 --> 01:00:50,832
How couldn't you tell?

1561
01:00:51,332 --> 01:00:53,102
I wanted to tell him.

1562
01:00:53,402 --> 01:00:55,201
What's this?

1563
01:00:55,201 --> 01:00:56,341
(It's the hidden mission board that'll answer Seok Jin's question.)

1564
01:00:56,341 --> 01:00:58,672
- This was perfect. - "While you eat ramyeon..."

1565
01:00:58,672 --> 01:01:00,411
"Don't make him say he wants it."

1566
01:01:00,411 --> 01:01:03,141
That's the first thing he said when he got here.

1567
01:01:03,141 --> 01:01:04,141
(He failed so quickly.)

1568
01:01:04,141 --> 01:01:06,212
- I was following you. - Oh, gosh.

1569
01:01:06,212 --> 01:01:08,411
- That was what it was. - You were following me.

1570
01:01:08,411 --> 01:01:09,621
"Do laundry for 20 minutes?"

1571
01:01:10,051 --> 01:01:11,792
They ran the laundry machine for 20 minutes.

1572
01:01:11,792 --> 01:01:13,522
They did? I had no idea.

1573
01:01:14,091 --> 01:01:15,821
- We did the laundry. - "Steal three of Seok Jin's..."

1574
01:01:15,821 --> 01:01:17,692
"belongings without getting caught."

1575
01:01:17,692 --> 01:01:19,132
- Isn't this a fail? - Why?

1576
01:01:19,132 --> 01:01:21,531
I asked where my phone went.

1577
01:01:21,531 --> 01:01:22,531
It was over before then.

1578
01:01:22,632 --> 01:01:24,132
Oh, really?

1579
01:01:24,132 --> 01:01:25,332
- It was long before. - Really?

1580
01:01:25,332 --> 01:01:26,602
It was long before.

1581
01:01:26,602 --> 01:01:28,942
When you asked us that, we were on the sixth mission.

1582
01:01:28,942 --> 01:01:30,341
Really?

1583
01:01:30,602 --> 01:01:33,112
It says to peel five onions, and he can't say "onion" during that time.

1584
01:01:33,672 --> 01:01:35,042
- You peeled onions? - I peeled it...

1585
01:01:35,042 --> 01:01:36,341
behind Jong Kook.

1586
01:01:36,341 --> 01:01:38,482
It made me tear up.

1587
01:01:38,511 --> 01:01:40,551
My eyes didn't burn at all.

1588
01:01:40,882 --> 01:01:42,781
- I'm serious. - My eyes still burn.

1589
01:01:43,082 --> 01:01:45,422
- The smell was pretty strong. - Really?

1590
01:01:45,621 --> 01:01:48,761
This is a cottage, so that's possible.

1591
01:01:49,862 --> 01:01:50,922
That's true.

1592
01:01:50,922 --> 01:01:52,962
- Cottages don't smell like this. - He thinks differently.

1593
01:01:52,962 --> 01:01:54,562
- It's possible. - He has a different point of view.

1594
01:01:54,562 --> 01:01:56,562
You can eat now,

1595
01:01:56,562 --> 01:01:58,332
and we'll head to our final location...

1596
01:01:58,332 --> 01:02:00,732
where you can switch your mission money.

1597
01:02:00,732 --> 01:02:03,772
It's more advantageous for you to get there early.

1598
01:02:03,772 --> 01:02:06,371
- Early? - Each member will leave separately.

1599
01:02:06,411 --> 01:02:07,442
Why is that?

1600
01:02:07,442 --> 01:02:10,781
(Each member will leave at separate times?)

1601
01:02:10,781 --> 01:02:13,411
This is our standard.

1602
01:02:13,982 --> 01:02:17,752
Besides all of you, Seok Jin had a hidden mission as well.

1603
01:02:18,051 --> 01:02:21,551
(He had a hidden mission?)

1604
01:02:21,551 --> 01:02:24,522
- What's that? - There was something going on.

1605
01:02:24,522 --> 01:02:25,962
(That was totally unexpected.)

1606
01:02:25,962 --> 01:02:27,192
There was something going on.

1607
01:02:27,192 --> 01:02:30,632
(What was Seok Jin's shocking mission?)

1608
01:02:32,701 --> 01:02:36,602
(Chapter 3: Blades of Revenge)

1609
01:02:37,141 --> 01:02:38,402
(One hour before the opening)

1610
01:02:38,402 --> 01:02:39,471
Hello.

1611
01:02:39,471 --> 01:02:41,982
What's going on today? Is this Seok Jin's Running Man?

1612
01:02:42,942 --> 01:02:44,312
Why am I here by myself?

1613
01:02:44,312 --> 01:02:45,482
(Why was he by himself?)

1614
01:02:45,482 --> 01:02:49,252
Soon, we'll conduct a mission called the Race of Wits.

1615
01:02:49,522 --> 01:02:51,522
Before the main mission is over,

1616
01:02:51,522 --> 01:02:54,422
you'll become Seok Jin the Swordsman.

1617
01:02:54,922 --> 01:02:57,591
(Seok Jin the Swordsman?)

1618
01:02:57,591 --> 01:03:00,792
You'll become Seok Jin the Swordsman and complete a hidden mission.

1619
01:03:00,792 --> 01:03:03,661
(He got a hidden mission while the others got theirs.)

1620
01:03:03,661 --> 01:03:04,832
Am I the main character?

1621
01:03:05,701 --> 01:03:07,902
We'll give you 30 blades...

1622
01:03:07,902 --> 01:03:10,442
as the swordsman.

1623
01:03:10,502 --> 01:03:13,542
You need to hide as many blades as possible...

1624
01:03:13,542 --> 01:03:15,542
in the bodies of the members.

1625
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:18,712
(He needs to hide 30 blades in the members' bodies.)

1626
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:21,112
The members with more blades...

1627
01:03:21,551 --> 01:03:23,681
will be at a disadvantage during the final mission.

1628
01:03:24,422 --> 01:03:25,891
This is not easy.

1629
01:03:26,022 --> 01:03:27,192
How am I supposed to hide them?

1630
01:03:27,491 --> 01:03:28,862
Where do I put them?

1631
01:03:29,422 --> 01:03:30,922
This is so difficult.

1632
01:03:30,922 --> 01:03:32,292
This is more difficult than a water gun.

1633
01:03:32,661 --> 01:03:33,832
That's why...

1634
01:03:34,431 --> 01:03:35,602
That's why...

1635
01:03:36,102 --> 01:03:40,002
we have invited another swordswoman who will help you.

1636
01:03:40,301 --> 01:03:41,402
Who is it?

1637
01:03:41,402 --> 01:03:43,272
(It's Soyou, a beautiful swordswoman.)

1638
01:03:43,272 --> 01:03:44,602
Soyou, your job is to...

1639
01:03:44,602 --> 01:03:47,672
help Seok Jin so that he doesn't get caught by the others...

1640
01:03:48,042 --> 01:03:50,511
while he hides the blades.

1641
01:03:50,511 --> 01:03:53,911
You're a hidden swordswoman.

1642
01:03:54,681 --> 01:04:00,121
(That's how their secret operation started.)

1643
01:04:01,051 --> 01:04:04,462
(He had blades in his hands and looked for chances.)

1644
01:04:04,462 --> 01:04:06,362
(While Soyou had the people's attention,)

1645
01:04:06,362 --> 01:04:11,402
(he hid the blades in the members' bags.)

1646
01:04:12,201 --> 01:04:17,502
(He tried ripping a name tag and put a blade underneath.)

1647
01:04:18,402 --> 01:04:23,011
(He got more bold with Kwang Soo right in front of him.)

1648
01:04:24,042 --> 01:04:26,011
(So Min left her bag here.)

1649
01:04:27,252 --> 01:04:32,292
(Soyou stretched herself and covered him.)

1650
01:04:33,051 --> 01:04:36,692
(He succeeded thanks to their perfect teamwork.)

1651
01:04:37,562 --> 01:04:40,132
- Rock-scissors-paper - Rock-scissors-paper

1652
01:04:40,792 --> 01:04:43,201
(He was darting in and out of places.)

1653
01:04:44,161 --> 01:04:47,902
(I'm not old yet. I'm just experienced.)

1654
01:04:48,272 --> 01:04:49,971
Besides all of you,

1655
01:04:49,971 --> 01:04:53,571
Seok Jin had a mission as well.

1656
01:04:53,571 --> 01:04:56,482
- What's that? - There was something going on.

1657
01:04:56,482 --> 01:04:57,812
What I found the most strange was...

1658
01:04:57,942 --> 01:04:59,582
when Seok Jin was going into the bathroom,

1659
01:04:59,582 --> 01:05:01,781
and there were three cameramen on him.

1660
01:05:01,781 --> 01:05:02,882
"What's the matter?"

1661
01:05:03,352 --> 01:05:04,621
"I'm going to use the bathroom."

1662
01:05:05,051 --> 01:05:08,221
(He wanted to use the bathroom while there were cameras?)

1663
01:05:11,522 --> 01:05:12,591
I'm going to pee.

1664
01:05:12,591 --> 01:05:13,692
(He was startled.)

1665
01:05:13,692 --> 01:05:14,962
(He tried to shut the door, but he was unsuccessful.)

1666
01:05:14,962 --> 01:05:16,362
- The camera is on. - I know.

1667
01:05:16,801 --> 01:05:18,132
What are you doing then?

1668
01:05:18,201 --> 01:05:19,301
Seok Jin.

1669
01:05:19,301 --> 01:05:20,301
(He ignores Kwang Soo.)

1670
01:05:20,301 --> 01:05:21,502
- Is that right? - Seok Jin.

1671
01:05:21,502 --> 01:05:23,371
(Why is he acting so awkwardly?)

1672
01:05:24,571 --> 01:05:25,612
Seok Jin.

1673
01:05:26,241 --> 01:05:27,411
Seok Jin.

1674
01:05:27,612 --> 01:05:30,882
(That's how you react when your wife finds out about your secret money.)

1675
01:05:30,882 --> 01:05:32,411
What's going on?

1676
01:05:32,982 --> 01:05:34,212
The cameraman was right in front of you.

1677
01:05:34,212 --> 01:05:35,551
I was going to tell him to wait outside.

1678
01:05:35,551 --> 01:05:36,882
I was going to close the door.

1679
01:05:36,882 --> 01:05:38,951
- You even made this gesture. - No, I didn't.

1680
01:05:40,891 --> 01:05:43,261
We'll head to our final location where you can switch...

1681
01:05:43,261 --> 01:05:45,792
- your mission money. - Okay.

1682
01:05:45,792 --> 01:05:48,931
According to the number of blades Seok Jin hid...

1683
01:05:48,931 --> 01:05:51,632
(The swordsman's identity is revealed.)

1684
01:05:51,632 --> 01:05:53,232
(What blades?)

1685
01:05:53,232 --> 01:05:56,341
Each blade counts for a minute you have to wait.

1686
01:05:56,341 --> 01:05:57,871
(Number of blades times 1 minute.)

1687
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:59,011
What do you mean? Where's mine?

1688
01:05:59,011 --> 01:06:00,911
- Where's mine? - There are blades?

1689
01:06:00,911 --> 01:06:02,612
- I have some. - Me too.

1690
01:06:03,112 --> 01:06:05,451
- I have blades. - Me too.

1691
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:07,082
Look at these blades.

1692
01:06:07,281 --> 01:06:08,482
Why do I have so many?

1693
01:06:08,821 --> 01:06:10,882
- Why do I have so many? - I have blades.

1694
01:06:10,882 --> 01:06:12,951
- I have 5. - I have 2.

1695
01:06:13,422 --> 01:06:16,891
Jong Kook, I have more than five.

1696
01:06:16,962 --> 01:06:18,491
- Look at that. - How many do you have?

1697
01:06:18,661 --> 01:06:21,031
You have one on your back too.

1698
01:06:21,031 --> 01:06:22,862
(She had 7 in her bag and 1 under the name tag.)

1699
01:06:22,862 --> 01:06:25,301
- Here's another one. - I only have two, right?

1700
01:06:25,801 --> 01:06:27,232
Ji Hyo.

1701
01:06:27,232 --> 01:06:28,701
- I have none. - You can get going.

1702
01:06:28,701 --> 01:06:31,871
Haha, Jong Kook, and Kwang Soo will leave in two minutes.

1703
01:06:31,871 --> 01:06:34,042
Jae Seok and Se Chan can leave in five minutes.

1704
01:06:34,112 --> 01:06:36,542
- I have 8. - You can leave in 8 minutes.

1705
01:06:36,542 --> 01:06:38,112
You can take your time, So Min.

1706
01:06:38,112 --> 01:06:39,781
Seok Jin, how many blades do you have left?

1707
01:06:39,781 --> 01:06:41,511
- I know. - He has a lot.

1708
01:06:41,511 --> 01:06:42,922
- You have six. - I do.

1709
01:06:42,922 --> 01:06:44,681
You can leave in six minutes.

1710
01:06:45,152 --> 01:06:46,221
What about us?

1711
01:06:46,221 --> 01:06:47,891
(Seok Jin will leave in 6 minutes.)

1712
01:06:49,321 --> 01:06:50,821
(This is the order they'll leave in.)

1713
01:06:50,821 --> 01:06:52,931
Soyou, thank you for coming...

1714
01:06:52,931 --> 01:06:55,431
- despite your busy schedule. - She's our family.

1715
01:06:55,431 --> 01:06:57,062
- I'm not that busy. - Is that right?

1716
01:06:57,261 --> 01:06:59,701
- You should come again. - Please invite me.

1717
01:06:59,772 --> 01:07:01,372
We'll invite you as a proper guest.

1718
01:07:01,471 --> 01:07:03,242
Come to So Min's housewarming party.

1719
01:07:03,242 --> 01:07:05,312
(Please join us at So Min's new place.)

1720
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:06,711
- Please come. - It's So Min's housewarming party.

1721
01:07:07,641 --> 01:07:09,081
Don't pressure her.

1722
01:07:09,211 --> 01:07:11,141
She's never met So Min before.

1723
01:07:11,282 --> 01:07:13,452
- She lives in a good neighborhood. - Don't push it.

1724
01:07:13,452 --> 01:07:14,581
(Please invite me next time.)

1725
01:07:15,181 --> 01:07:18,181
Please give her a round of applause. Thank you.

1726
01:07:18,322 --> 01:07:19,622
- Thank you. - Good work.

1727
01:07:19,622 --> 01:07:22,461
- Thank you. - See you.

1728
01:07:22,562 --> 01:07:25,461
- Soyou. - Take care.

1729
01:07:25,461 --> 01:07:26,562
(It's time to head to their final location.)

1730
01:07:26,562 --> 01:07:28,902
Ji Hyo, you have no blades,

1731
01:07:29,501 --> 01:07:31,602
so you can get going.

1732
01:07:31,602 --> 01:07:32,801
I'll get going first.

1733
01:07:33,032 --> 01:07:34,331
- See you soon. - Good luck.

1734
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:38,372
Good thing I was holding onto my bag.

1735
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:41,612
It reads "hydrogen house".

1736
01:07:42,081 --> 01:07:43,511
Is this an electric car?

1737
01:07:45,652 --> 01:07:46,881
Let's go.

1738
01:07:46,881 --> 01:07:47,982
(It's more advantageous to arrive early.)

1739
01:07:47,982 --> 01:07:49,952
Look. This car is so quiet.

1740
01:07:50,152 --> 01:07:52,591
Kwang Soo, Haha, and Jong Kook can get going.

1741
01:07:52,591 --> 01:07:54,452
- Let's go. - Bye.

1742
01:07:54,522 --> 01:07:56,522
- See you later. - Good luck.

1743
01:07:56,761 --> 01:07:59,131
Jae Seok and Se Chan.

1744
01:07:59,431 --> 01:08:00,961
So Min, you can go.

1745
01:08:01,562 --> 01:08:05,572
(Their final destination is a hydrogen house.)

1746
01:08:06,402 --> 01:08:07,872
I'm here.

1747
01:08:08,272 --> 01:08:09,572
It's a hydrogen house.

1748
01:08:09,572 --> 01:08:11,602
(She arrives at the hydrogen house, riding an electric car.)

1749
01:08:13,242 --> 01:08:15,942
(She gets out,)

1750
01:08:15,942 --> 01:08:19,482
(but what is she supposed to do?)

1751
01:08:22,581 --> 01:08:24,051
"Pirate's Treasure Box".

1752
01:08:24,051 --> 01:08:26,751
"Find the blades hidden in the pirate's house,"

1753
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:28,192
"and use them for the following mission."

1754
01:08:28,192 --> 01:08:29,961
"Each blade is worth 10 dollars."

1755
01:08:29,961 --> 01:08:32,631
(Each blade is worth 10 dollars?)

1756
01:08:33,662 --> 01:08:40,171
(There are blades hidden inside the hydrogen house.)

1757
01:08:42,471 --> 01:08:45,272
"Once you plug the car to the house and start the car,"

1758
01:08:45,272 --> 01:08:47,141
"the electricity will come on."

1759
01:08:47,141 --> 01:08:49,141
(Pirate's Treasure Box)

1760
01:08:49,312 --> 01:08:50,312
The other way?

1761
01:08:50,312 --> 01:08:53,251
(Power for digital appliances within the house are supplied by the car.)

1762
01:08:53,251 --> 01:08:55,152
(You need to connect the power...)

1763
01:08:55,152 --> 01:08:56,282
Turn on the car.

1764
01:08:56,282 --> 01:08:57,852
(You need to connect the power and turn on the car.)

1765
01:08:57,852 --> 01:08:59,822
(The lights come on.)

1766
01:08:59,822 --> 01:09:01,322
The lights came on.

1767
01:09:01,322 --> 01:09:02,921
(The power is from the electric car.)

1768
01:09:03,522 --> 01:09:07,532
(There are 25 blades hidden inside the house.)

1769
01:09:07,532 --> 01:09:11,831
(Ji Hyo gets started first.)

1770
01:09:11,931 --> 01:09:13,402
(She's fascinated.)

1771
01:09:16,001 --> 01:09:18,301
(She finds a key to the car.)

1772
01:09:18,402 --> 01:09:19,541
Car key.

1773
01:09:20,772 --> 01:09:23,242
(She's amazed by the new technology.)

1774
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:25,251
Did you see that? Did you?

1775
01:09:31,051 --> 01:09:32,791
This is awesome.

1776
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:34,421
I have one blade.

1777
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:37,692
(She earns 10 dollars.)

1778
01:09:38,022 --> 01:09:40,591
They're here.

1779
01:09:40,862 --> 01:09:44,862
(The others come 2 minutes later.)

1780
01:09:44,862 --> 01:09:46,331
10 dollars per blade?

1781
01:09:46,631 --> 01:09:48,742
It's better the faster you get them.

1782
01:09:50,602 --> 01:09:52,112
I was checking out the car.

1783
01:09:52,112 --> 01:09:53,572
(She was too distracted.)

1784
01:09:53,942 --> 01:09:56,612
(Where are the blades?)

1785
01:09:57,912 --> 01:09:59,211
- Ji Hyo. - Yes?

1786
01:09:59,211 --> 01:10:00,912
- Did you find many? - No.

1787
01:10:01,312 --> 01:10:02,782
I just got here.

1788
01:10:03,452 --> 01:10:05,952
What's this? This is where they are.

1789
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:10,562
(He finds a blade under the table.)

1790
01:10:11,421 --> 01:10:13,961
What's this? Why did they miss this?

1791
01:10:14,761 --> 01:10:15,862
Here's one as well.

1792
01:10:16,032 --> 01:10:18,362
Here.

1793
01:10:18,872 --> 01:10:19,931
Here.

1794
01:10:19,931 --> 01:10:22,471
(He overcomes the 2-minute handicap and finds the blades.)

1795
01:10:23,301 --> 01:10:25,711
(What's that?)

1796
01:10:29,711 --> 01:10:32,312
(It's underneath the pot.)

1797
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:33,812
(Dashing)

1798
01:10:34,852 --> 01:10:38,152
(He intercepted with lightning speed.)

1799
01:10:38,152 --> 01:10:39,352
You are so sly.

1800
01:10:39,791 --> 01:10:41,391
- Don't you think so? - What?

1801
01:10:41,391 --> 01:10:42,391
What's wrong?

1802
01:10:42,391 --> 01:10:44,062
- That was so cunning. - Me?

1803
01:10:44,062 --> 01:10:47,032
- What do you mean? - That's what it seemed like.

1804
01:10:47,032 --> 01:10:49,662
- What do you mean? - I didn't even find one.

1805
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:51,702
(His slyness didn't go so well with his bulky body.)

1806
01:10:51,931 --> 01:10:53,931
I bet they already took many.

1807
01:10:53,931 --> 01:10:55,032
(Jae Seok and Se Chan left 5 minutes later.)

1808
01:10:55,032 --> 01:10:56,742
How many did you find, Ji Hyo?

1809
01:10:57,202 --> 01:10:58,442
I found a few.

1810
01:10:58,442 --> 01:10:59,971
My gosh.

1811
01:10:59,971 --> 01:11:01,471
(He gets lucky.)

1812
01:11:01,471 --> 01:11:05,081
- I found one right away. - My gosh.

1813
01:11:05,081 --> 01:11:06,152
You found one?

1814
01:11:06,251 --> 01:11:08,081
I didn't even find one. Where did you see it?

1815
01:11:08,381 --> 01:11:10,482
- Kwang Soo. - I didn't find one. I came early.

1816
01:11:10,482 --> 01:11:12,522
(Here's one.)

1817
01:11:12,522 --> 01:11:17,022
(Se Chan points Kwang Soo towards an envelope.)

1818
01:11:18,532 --> 01:11:20,961
(Thanks, Se Chan.)

1819
01:11:24,662 --> 01:11:25,732
Gosh.

1820
01:11:25,732 --> 01:11:26,831
(It's empty.)

1821
01:11:26,831 --> 01:11:27,971
He believed me.

1822
01:11:30,041 --> 01:11:32,442
(He loves pranking Kwang Soo.)

1823
01:11:32,471 --> 01:11:34,242
I'm going to hit you.

1824
01:11:37,841 --> 01:11:41,711
(Haha finds a key to the electric car.)

1825
01:11:41,822 --> 01:11:42,921
I'll look inside the car.

1826
01:11:42,921 --> 01:11:46,891
(There must be many blades in the car.)

1827
01:11:48,192 --> 01:11:49,662
Stay there.

1828
01:11:50,221 --> 01:11:51,421
I'll go when they are gone.

1829
01:11:51,421 --> 01:11:52,591
(He leaves his cameraman.)

1830
01:11:53,532 --> 01:11:57,761
(Everybody is busy looking for the remaining blades.)

1831
01:11:57,761 --> 01:12:03,402
(He looks at the car and goes around it.)

1832
01:12:03,942 --> 01:12:05,171
(It's bothersome to get the others to come.)

1833
01:12:05,171 --> 01:12:07,442
It's better to come early.

1834
01:12:07,772 --> 01:12:09,011
- It's better. - It is.

1835
01:12:09,081 --> 01:12:10,181
The door doesn't open.

1836
01:12:10,181 --> 01:12:12,982
(He acts nonchalantly.)

1837
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:17,122
(I want to find at least one.)

1838
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:22,761
(You can look there. I'll get in the car.)

1839
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:26,631
(He quickly opens the car door.)

1840
01:12:26,631 --> 01:12:29,461
(He gets inside the treasure house.)

1841
01:12:30,402 --> 01:12:34,072
(This place is full of hidden blades.)

1842
01:12:34,072 --> 01:12:35,072
Where could they be?

1843
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:41,982
(There must be many inside.)

1844
01:12:43,141 --> 01:12:46,881
(The door is locked.)

1845
01:12:48,381 --> 01:12:49,421
(I'll be rich alone.)

1846
01:12:49,421 --> 01:12:54,291
Today is my lucky day

1847
01:12:54,291 --> 01:12:56,662
(Hello, please open the door.)

1848
01:12:58,122 --> 01:13:00,562
(He takes everything without looking outside.)

1849
01:13:01,591 --> 01:13:04,131
You'd better brace yourself for New Zealand.

1850
01:13:04,131 --> 01:13:05,872
You'll come with me.

1851
01:13:06,801 --> 01:13:09,242
- Brace yourself. - Listen, Jae Seok.

1852
01:13:09,242 --> 01:13:11,671
Let's be easy. I won't pick you.

1853
01:13:11,671 --> 01:13:12,671
(Jae Seok decides to pick Haha.)

1854
01:13:12,671 --> 01:13:15,412
- Brace yourself for New Zealand. - Come on, Jae Seok.

1855
01:13:17,141 --> 01:13:18,141
(Seok Jin comes running.)

1856
01:13:18,141 --> 01:13:19,152
May I go in?

1857
01:13:19,681 --> 01:13:21,381
You won't find anything there.

1858
01:13:21,482 --> 01:13:22,482
Did you find them all?

1859
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:23,482
(Haha probably did.)

1860
01:13:24,482 --> 01:13:25,522
Someone found all of them.

1861
01:13:25,522 --> 01:13:26,522
(The race is over.)

1862
01:13:26,992 --> 01:13:29,662
(The number of blades that each member has)

1863
01:13:29,662 --> 01:13:33,032
You receive 10 dollars for each blade that you found.

1864
01:13:33,032 --> 01:13:36,131
Blades will play an important role in the final round.

1865
01:13:36,331 --> 01:13:37,562
It's good that you have one.

1866
01:13:37,562 --> 01:13:39,872
I have none. Do you have any?

1867
01:13:39,872 --> 01:13:42,872
As soon as So Min arrives,

1868
01:13:42,872 --> 01:13:45,612
we'll start the final mission with these blades.

1869
01:13:47,312 --> 01:13:51,081
(Thanks to So Min, the others enjoy some free time.)

1870
01:13:51,681 --> 01:13:53,681
It's run by hydrogen.

1871
01:13:53,681 --> 01:13:56,352
- Really? - It exits this way.

1872
01:13:56,381 --> 01:13:58,891
When I push the button, the electricity runs this way.

1873
01:13:58,891 --> 01:14:00,952
- This is unbelievable. - I see.

1874
01:14:00,952 --> 01:14:01,961
Take a look.

1875
01:14:02,492 --> 01:14:04,862
Do you see where it's going?

1876
01:14:05,362 --> 01:14:07,461
Does the electricity run in the car?

1877
01:14:08,091 --> 01:14:09,501
I see it.

1878
01:14:10,232 --> 01:14:11,872
- Do you operate the building... - Look, Kwang Soo.

1879
01:14:11,872 --> 01:14:13,232
with the electricity from this car?

1880
01:14:13,232 --> 01:14:15,301
There's electricity around you too.

1881
01:14:15,501 --> 01:14:17,942
- Around me? - Electricity is running around you.

1882
01:14:17,971 --> 01:14:20,171
- I'm a human being. - Look at the electricity flow.

1883
01:14:20,341 --> 01:14:21,641
This is interesting.

1884
01:14:23,482 --> 01:14:25,912
Where should I go?

1885
01:14:26,282 --> 01:14:27,312
What happened?

1886
01:14:27,352 --> 01:14:30,181
There was a mission to find the blades.

1887
01:14:30,581 --> 01:14:32,391
Everyone found all of them.

1888
01:14:33,391 --> 01:14:35,192
(The mission is over.)

1889
01:14:35,322 --> 01:14:36,362
You may go in.

1890
01:14:36,362 --> 01:14:38,591
- Are there any blades left for me? - No.

1891
01:14:38,591 --> 01:14:40,131
- Is it over? - Yes.

1892
01:14:40,131 --> 01:14:41,532
I risked my life to come here.

1893
01:14:41,732 --> 01:14:43,232
You may go in.

1894
01:14:43,362 --> 01:14:45,572
(It's too early to give up. What's the final mission?)

1895
01:14:45,572 --> 01:14:46,872
My efforts were futile.

1896
01:14:46,872 --> 01:14:48,131
(It's too early to give up. What's the final mission?)

1897
01:14:48,131 --> 01:14:49,841
Do you have your blades?

1898
01:14:49,841 --> 01:14:51,001
- Yes. - No.

1899
01:14:52,112 --> 01:14:53,242
(What do you mean? Blades?)

1900
01:14:53,242 --> 01:14:54,671
I have none.

1901
01:14:54,671 --> 01:14:55,681
I have one blade.

1902
01:14:55,841 --> 01:14:58,782
You have a chance to turn the tables during the final mission.

1903
01:14:58,782 --> 01:15:00,581
- What's the mission? - It's Barrel Man's Quiz.

1904
01:15:00,581 --> 01:15:05,081
(The final mission is Barrel Man's Quiz.)

1905
01:15:05,421 --> 01:15:08,251
- I feel most confident about this. - We'll start the quiz.

1906
01:15:08,352 --> 01:15:10,162
Listen to the question.

1907
01:15:10,162 --> 01:15:12,331
The member to raise the cushion the fastest while calling out...

1908
01:15:12,492 --> 01:15:14,791
- his name gets to answer. - Okay.

1909
01:15:14,862 --> 01:15:16,501
When you get a chance to answer,

1910
01:15:16,501 --> 01:15:20,131
stick and bet as many blades as you wish in the barrel,

1911
01:15:20,131 --> 01:15:22,001
and say your answer.

1912
01:15:22,402 --> 01:15:23,942
What if your answer is correct?

1913
01:15:23,942 --> 01:15:27,671
Then you gain double the number of blades that you have stuck.

1914
01:15:27,671 --> 01:15:29,482
(You gain twice as many blades as you bet.)

1915
01:15:29,482 --> 01:15:32,282
(You can double the number of blades.)

1916
01:15:32,282 --> 01:15:35,581
If another member bets more blades,

1917
01:15:35,581 --> 01:15:38,751
he takes the chance to answer.

1918
01:15:38,751 --> 01:15:40,122
(Another member may steal the chance.)

1919
01:15:40,122 --> 01:15:42,622
You can earn double the number of blades.

1920
01:15:42,692 --> 01:15:45,961
If the pirate pops up, the question will be null.

1921
01:15:46,562 --> 01:15:48,131
You must know the answer.

1922
01:15:48,362 --> 01:15:51,261
We shouldn't bet if we don't know the answer.

1923
01:15:51,261 --> 01:15:53,072
- Right. - I can turn the tables.

1924
01:15:53,671 --> 01:15:55,902
Who cleared the mission...

1925
01:15:56,372 --> 01:15:57,872
at the wit castle?

1926
01:15:57,872 --> 01:15:58,872
- Me. - Me.

1927
01:15:58,872 --> 01:16:00,612
Each of you won 20 dollars.

1928
01:16:00,612 --> 01:16:02,511
- Seok Jin won 30 dollars. - Right.

1929
01:16:02,511 --> 01:16:04,442
I converted the amount to blades.

1930
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:07,112
I hardly have anything.

1931
01:16:07,181 --> 01:16:08,751
I have three blades at least.

1932
01:16:09,081 --> 01:16:10,181
Here's the first question.

1933
01:16:11,152 --> 01:16:12,152
Among the choices,

1934
01:16:13,051 --> 01:16:15,421
which one wasn't born in an egg?

1935
01:16:15,421 --> 01:16:17,562
(Which one wasn't born in an egg?)

1936
01:16:17,562 --> 01:16:19,091
- Okay. - Did you say, "egg"?

1937
01:16:19,091 --> 01:16:21,091
- I like history. - One, Hyeokgeose of Silla

1938
01:16:21,431 --> 01:16:22,732
Two, King Dongmyeong.

1939
01:16:23,232 --> 01:16:24,431
Three, King Suro.

1940
01:16:24,662 --> 01:16:25,872
Four, King Onjo.

1941
01:16:26,471 --> 01:16:28,331
I only know two of them.

1942
01:16:28,331 --> 01:16:29,341
(Haha is confused.)

1943
01:16:29,772 --> 01:16:31,841
Kwang Soo.

1944
01:16:31,971 --> 01:16:32,971
I bet two blades.

1945
01:16:33,211 --> 01:16:34,612
What?

1946
01:16:35,112 --> 01:16:36,112
(He must stick them successfully.)

1947
01:16:36,112 --> 01:16:37,641
- I hope he fails. - Isn't it number two?

1948
01:16:37,841 --> 01:16:38,852
- Two? - I hope he pops.

1949
01:16:38,881 --> 01:16:40,381
(No way.)

1950
01:16:41,381 --> 01:16:42,921
- Please pop. - Come on.

1951
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:45,051
- Please pop. - No way.

1952
01:16:45,551 --> 01:16:48,992
(He has the chance to double the number of blades.)

1953
01:16:48,992 --> 01:16:49,992
Okay!

1954
01:16:49,992 --> 01:16:51,591
(He makes his bet successfully.)

1955
01:16:51,591 --> 01:16:53,192
Seok Jin. I bet three.

1956
01:16:53,862 --> 01:16:54,931
- Okay. - I hope he pops.

1957
01:16:55,032 --> 01:16:57,232
- I hope he fails. - If I succeed this time,

1958
01:16:57,331 --> 01:16:58,671
I'll be first place.

1959
01:16:59,032 --> 01:17:00,931
- Please pop. - Goodness.

1960
01:17:00,931 --> 01:17:02,272
He's going to pop.

1961
01:17:02,272 --> 01:17:06,041
(Seok Jin makes a bold move to become the final winner.)

1962
01:17:06,041 --> 01:17:08,141
He takes a big risk after three weeks.

1963
01:17:08,982 --> 01:17:10,681
I usually take many risks.

1964
01:17:10,681 --> 01:17:11,742
(He gets defensive.)

1965
01:17:11,742 --> 01:17:13,511
He takes a big risk...

1966
01:17:13,511 --> 01:17:16,381
- after three weeks. - The viewers will believe you.

1967
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:17,982
You're holding down the pirate.

1968
01:17:18,692 --> 01:17:20,221
Am I?

1969
01:17:20,221 --> 01:17:22,862
- I made a mistake. - Do it.

1970
01:17:24,162 --> 01:17:25,162
Let's see.

1971
01:17:25,562 --> 01:17:27,732
- Please pop. - He's going to pop.

1972
01:17:27,732 --> 01:17:29,261
- He'll pop this time. - Okay.

1973
01:17:29,461 --> 01:17:30,461
He did well.

1974
01:17:30,461 --> 01:17:32,872
Stick two more blades if you want to raise your bet.

1975
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:35,402
- I'll bet two more. - Okay.

1976
01:17:35,402 --> 01:17:36,772
- That's right. - Do you know the answer?

1977
01:17:36,772 --> 01:17:38,841
You don't know the answer, Kwang Soo.

1978
01:17:38,841 --> 01:17:40,312
- It's a war. - Do you?

1979
01:17:40,471 --> 01:17:41,471
The pirate will pop.

1980
01:17:41,471 --> 01:17:42,742
(Kwang Soo is close to the pirate.)

1981
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:44,412
(He's very unlucky with the pirate oak barrel.)

1982
01:17:44,412 --> 01:17:45,982
- Kwang Soo might win. - Stick one more.

1983
01:17:46,581 --> 01:17:47,751
- Let's get it. - Let's get it.

1984
01:17:47,751 --> 01:17:49,251
- Stick it in. - Let's get it.

1985
01:17:49,251 --> 01:17:51,051
- Okay. - He's safe.

1986
01:17:51,251 --> 01:17:52,421
Raise your bet, Seok Jin.

1987
01:17:52,421 --> 01:17:55,362
(What will Seok Jin decide?)

1988
01:17:55,362 --> 01:17:56,461
- Raise it by 3. - I'll bet 3 more.

1989
01:17:56,461 --> 01:17:58,362
- Let's get it. - I'll bet 3 more.

1990
01:17:58,362 --> 01:17:59,391
(Seok Jin gets ambitious.)

1991
01:17:59,391 --> 01:18:00,761
- Let's get it. - He's a real man.

1992
01:18:00,761 --> 01:18:01,831
Raise it by three.

1993
01:18:01,862 --> 01:18:03,862
- I don't have anymore. - Let's get it.

1994
01:18:03,862 --> 01:18:05,971
- Let's get it. - He knows how to play.

1995
01:18:05,971 --> 01:18:07,072
He's being bold.

1996
01:18:07,072 --> 01:18:10,072
I know how to play it after 25 years of experience.

1997
01:18:10,072 --> 01:18:11,671
He knows how to play.

1998
01:18:13,312 --> 01:18:14,341
That's right.

1999
01:18:15,181 --> 01:18:16,341
Okay.

2000
01:18:16,341 --> 01:18:18,312
That's how it goes.

2001
01:18:18,312 --> 01:18:20,381
- You lost. - You lost.

2002
01:18:20,381 --> 01:18:22,352
He popped.

2003
01:18:22,782 --> 01:18:25,551
- I don't believe this. - It seemed suspicious.

2004
01:18:25,591 --> 01:18:26,591
Here I go.

2005
01:18:26,591 --> 01:18:28,492
- Kwang Soo? - Answer correctly.

2006
01:18:28,492 --> 01:18:29,562
You'd better be right.

2007
01:18:29,562 --> 01:18:31,831
Kwang Soo bet four blades.

2008
01:18:31,831 --> 01:18:33,331
- Yes. - If he gets it wrong,

2009
01:18:33,331 --> 01:18:35,301
this round will end in clear results.

2010
01:18:35,301 --> 01:18:36,662
- I hope he's wrong. - It's difficult.

2011
01:18:36,662 --> 01:18:37,662
What's the answer?

2012
01:18:37,662 --> 01:18:41,272
(What will be Kwang Soo's answer?)

2013
01:18:42,742 --> 01:18:44,301
- Three, King Dongmyeong. - What?

2014
01:18:44,301 --> 01:18:46,471
- 3? - 3 is King Suro.

2015
01:18:46,471 --> 01:18:47,942
(What are you saying?)

2016
01:18:47,942 --> 01:18:49,782
That's definitely incorrect.

2017
01:18:49,782 --> 01:18:51,912
- Wait a minute. - That's incorrect.

2018
01:18:51,982 --> 01:18:53,952
(Please listen to me.)

2019
01:18:54,352 --> 01:18:56,952
Three was King Suro.

2020
01:18:56,952 --> 01:18:58,181
Three was King Suro.

2021
01:18:58,181 --> 01:18:59,322
That's right.

2022
01:18:59,322 --> 01:19:01,352
Seok Jin loses 6, and Kwang Soo loses 4.

2023
01:19:01,352 --> 01:19:02,992
- Let me do it again. - Let me do it again.

2024
01:19:02,992 --> 01:19:04,291
- Let me do it again. - Is it over?

2025
01:19:04,291 --> 01:19:08,131
- Let me do it again. - You should remember correctly.

2026
01:19:08,131 --> 01:19:09,761
Why did you brag?

2027
01:19:10,461 --> 01:19:11,602
You were arrogant.

2028
01:19:11,602 --> 01:19:12,671
Kwang Soo doesn't feel bad.

2029
01:19:12,671 --> 01:19:15,442
You'd call out the wrong answer anyway.

2030
01:19:16,372 --> 01:19:18,872
Kwang Soo, make sure that you know the answer.

2031
01:19:18,872 --> 01:19:20,242
Here's the next question.

2032
01:19:20,971 --> 01:19:24,942
What's the neologism that refers to people who keep their heads down...

2033
01:19:24,942 --> 01:19:27,881
- to stare at their smartphones? - I don't know.

2034
01:19:27,881 --> 01:19:29,152
I know the answer.

2035
01:19:29,152 --> 01:19:32,152
- One, smankenstein. - I have no idea.

2036
01:19:32,152 --> 01:19:34,192
Two, smacula.

2037
01:19:34,192 --> 01:19:35,761
Three, smombie.

2038
01:19:35,761 --> 01:19:36,921
- What's "smombie"? - Four, smummy.

2039
01:19:36,921 --> 01:19:39,331
- Jae Seok. - He's very good.

2040
01:19:39,331 --> 01:19:40,331
The answer is three.

2041
01:19:40,331 --> 01:19:41,362
(He answers too early.)

2042
01:19:43,261 --> 01:19:44,331
(Why are you answering now?)

2043
01:19:44,331 --> 01:19:46,202
- The answer is three. - Kwang Soo.

2044
01:19:46,202 --> 01:19:48,671
(Everyone raises their hands.)

2045
01:19:48,772 --> 01:19:49,942
- I should make a bet. - Right.

2046
01:19:49,942 --> 01:19:51,242
The real bet starts.

2047
01:19:51,772 --> 01:19:53,341
You should raise your bet.

2048
01:19:53,341 --> 01:19:55,282
- You must raise the bet. - The answer is three.

2049
01:19:55,282 --> 01:19:56,581
What's your bet?

2050
01:19:56,581 --> 01:19:58,952
I'll bet six blades.

2051
01:19:58,952 --> 01:19:59,982
Let's get it.

2052
01:20:00,051 --> 01:20:02,282
Jae Seok, can you say, "Let's get it"?

2053
01:20:03,051 --> 01:20:05,352
- Let's get it. - Can you say it?

2054
01:20:06,192 --> 01:20:07,992
Goodness, the pirate might pop.

2055
01:20:08,421 --> 01:20:09,421
(Thud)

2056
01:20:10,122 --> 01:20:11,122
That was loud.

2057
01:20:11,391 --> 01:20:14,291
Please, let's get it.

2058
01:20:14,761 --> 01:20:17,102
Let's get it. Wait.

2059
01:20:17,261 --> 01:20:18,831
Do you hope that the pirate will pop?

2060
01:20:18,971 --> 01:20:21,501
- I hope he will pop. - Please.

2061
01:20:21,501 --> 01:20:23,671
- Please. - You can do it, Jae Seok.

2062
01:20:23,671 --> 01:20:24,671
(He sticks 6 blades.)

2063
01:20:24,671 --> 01:20:25,671
Let's get it.

2064
01:20:26,041 --> 01:20:27,671
(He makes his bet successfully.)

2065
01:20:27,671 --> 01:20:28,681
That was close.

2066
01:20:28,881 --> 01:20:30,841
You get 10 seconds.

2067
01:20:30,841 --> 01:20:32,482
If you don't raise the bet, Jae Seok gets his turn.

2068
01:20:32,482 --> 01:20:34,412
- I don't feel confident. - Jae Seok may win 12.

2069
01:20:34,412 --> 01:20:35,421
I bet seven blades.

2070
01:20:35,421 --> 01:20:37,581
(She makes a bet of 7 blades.)

2071
01:20:39,882 --> 01:20:41,282
- Seven? - Really?

2072
01:20:41,282 --> 01:20:42,521
(Can you bet 7?)

2073
01:20:42,622 --> 01:20:44,452
- She said 7. - 7?

2074
01:20:44,492 --> 01:20:46,162
(So Min is fearless.)

2075
01:20:46,761 --> 01:20:49,261
- What's wrong with her? - We only live once.

2076
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:51,261
(She stays positive.)

2077
01:20:51,261 --> 01:20:54,302
You can take your turn later.

2078
01:20:54,302 --> 01:20:55,372
She bets everything.

2079
01:20:55,532 --> 01:20:58,502
(So Min makes another bold move.)

2080
01:20:58,502 --> 01:21:02,271
(She must stick 7 blades in 18 remaining slots.)

2081
01:21:02,712 --> 01:21:04,542
Do I get to answer if So Min fails?

2082
01:21:04,542 --> 01:21:06,782
Is that so?

2083
01:21:06,782 --> 01:21:09,351
(She starts carefully.)

2084
01:21:09,351 --> 01:21:12,321
(What happened?)

2085
01:21:14,721 --> 01:21:16,391
(You definitely live once.)

2086
01:21:16,391 --> 01:21:18,592
You shouldn't have made the bet.

2087
01:21:19,191 --> 01:21:20,292
Goodness.

2088
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,592
That was so unlucky.

2089
01:21:21,592 --> 01:21:23,592
- Goodbye. - Give me your seven blades.

2090
01:21:23,592 --> 01:21:25,401
What's wrong with me today?

2091
01:21:25,401 --> 01:21:26,601
What's wrong with me?

2092
01:21:27,361 --> 01:21:29,471
You shouldn't have taken the risk.

2093
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:31,002
What's the answer, Jae Seok?

2094
01:21:31,532 --> 01:21:33,172
It's three, smombie.

2095
01:21:34,141 --> 01:21:35,412
(The answer is correct.)

2096
01:21:35,412 --> 01:21:37,011
- "Smombie"? - What's the reason?

2097
01:21:37,011 --> 01:21:38,271
- Smombie is correct. - It comes from zombie.

2098
01:21:38,271 --> 01:21:39,412
Was that correct?

2099
01:21:39,412 --> 01:21:41,712
Six blades are good enough.

2100
01:21:41,712 --> 01:21:43,351
- This is great. - Let's continue.

2101
01:21:43,351 --> 01:21:44,351
Let's go.

2102
01:21:44,351 --> 01:21:47,282
Which is the standard Korean word?

2103
01:21:47,282 --> 01:21:49,351
The questions are too difficult.

2104
01:21:49,351 --> 01:21:52,162
All right. I just need to get this one.

2105
01:21:52,261 --> 01:21:54,122
One, married woman.

2106
01:21:54,261 --> 01:21:56,292
Two, chives.

2107
01:21:56,492 --> 01:21:58,561
Three, fritters.

2108
01:21:58,601 --> 01:22:00,162
Four, in a flash.

2109
01:22:01,401 --> 01:22:02,401
So Min.

2110
01:22:03,231 --> 01:22:05,032
(She must know the answer.)

2111
01:22:05,032 --> 01:22:06,242
- Is it "in a flash"? - I bet one blade.

2112
01:22:06,242 --> 01:22:07,242
Hurry up.

2113
01:22:07,242 --> 01:22:08,542
(She bets one blade.)

2114
01:22:08,542 --> 01:22:09,742
So Min.

2115
01:22:09,912 --> 01:22:11,372
She hardly has any blades.

2116
01:22:11,441 --> 01:22:13,011
She tries hard to participate.

2117
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:14,611
(She remains passionate.)

2118
01:22:14,611 --> 01:22:16,782
(She sticks one blade.)

2119
01:22:17,212 --> 01:22:18,922
Kwang Soo. I bet two blades.

2120
01:22:18,922 --> 01:22:20,282
(He waited for his moment.)

2121
01:22:20,282 --> 01:22:23,151
What are you two doing? Stop it already.

2122
01:22:23,151 --> 01:22:25,691
- Both of them make... - I won't give her a chance.

2123
01:22:25,792 --> 01:22:27,092
small bets.

2124
01:22:28,092 --> 01:22:30,361
- Seriously... - You got unlucky, Kwang Soo.

2125
01:22:30,962 --> 01:22:31,962
(Kwang Soo does it again.)

2126
01:22:31,962 --> 01:22:34,032
He is unbelievable.

2127
01:22:34,901 --> 01:22:38,471
(So Min gets a chance to answer with one blade.)

2128
01:22:38,601 --> 01:22:40,342
You are unbelievable.

2129
01:22:40,342 --> 01:22:42,242
- You are amazing. - You are the king of variety shows.

2130
01:22:42,242 --> 01:22:43,742
- How did you do that? - Seriously.

2131
01:22:43,742 --> 01:22:45,641
- So Min, answer the question. - So Min.

2132
01:22:45,712 --> 01:22:47,412
- My goodness. - I think I will get it wrong.

2133
01:22:48,111 --> 01:22:49,412
Three, fritters.

2134
01:22:49,782 --> 01:22:51,011
Three, fritters.

2135
01:22:52,122 --> 01:22:55,221
- The answer was four, in a flash. - I knew the answer.

2136
01:22:55,792 --> 01:22:57,052
I really did.

2137
01:22:57,052 --> 01:22:58,521
- Let's change the barrel. - We will change the barrel.

2138
01:22:58,521 --> 01:22:59,691
How many questions do we have left?

2139
01:22:59,691 --> 01:23:01,321
The blades are in the barrel.

2140
01:23:01,321 --> 01:23:04,792
- Maybe they have two in total. - Kwang Soo.

2141
01:23:04,792 --> 01:23:05,901
Give them the blade.

2142
01:23:06,662 --> 01:23:08,702
(Kwang Soo, give them the blade.)

2143
01:23:08,702 --> 01:23:09,872
Give them the blade.

2144
01:23:10,731 --> 01:23:12,872
(A moment ago)

2145
01:23:12,872 --> 01:23:15,441
(He takes out a blade on the pirate oak barrel.)

2146
01:23:15,441 --> 01:23:18,481
(The members catch him trying to steal it.)

2147
01:23:18,842 --> 01:23:20,511
Kwang Soo, give them the blade.

2148
01:23:20,511 --> 01:23:22,811
Do you know how many pairs of eyes were watching you?

2149
01:23:22,811 --> 01:23:24,752
I was watching you to see what you would do.

2150
01:23:24,752 --> 01:23:27,021
- Kwang Soo, don't be like that. - Your hands are too slow.

2151
01:23:27,021 --> 01:23:28,952
(My hands are slow now.)

2152
01:23:28,952 --> 01:23:30,452
You shouldn't do that.

2153
01:23:30,452 --> 01:23:31,521
(It's time for the last question.)

2154
01:23:31,521 --> 01:23:34,021
Here comes the final round with the last question.

2155
01:23:34,292 --> 01:23:35,462
I will go all in.

2156
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:36,962
- I will go all in. - Let's go.

2157
01:23:36,962 --> 01:23:40,561
The symbol of the Olympic Games...

2158
01:23:40,561 --> 01:23:42,471
is the Olympics rings which is the five interlocking rings...

2159
01:23:42,471 --> 01:23:44,632
of 3 rings on the top and 2 rings on the bottom...

2160
01:23:44,632 --> 01:23:46,042
in different colors.

2161
01:23:46,042 --> 01:23:47,242
This question is hard.

2162
01:23:47,242 --> 01:23:49,971
Which color isn't in the Olympics rings?

2163
01:23:49,971 --> 01:23:51,271
Wait a minute.

2164
01:23:51,441 --> 01:23:53,311
One, blue.

2165
01:23:53,542 --> 01:23:55,181
Two, black.

2166
01:23:55,511 --> 01:23:57,351
Three, orange.

2167
01:23:57,782 --> 01:23:59,252
Four, green.

2168
01:23:59,351 --> 01:24:00,382
- Jae Seok. - Kwang Soo.

2169
01:24:00,382 --> 01:24:01,452
Jae Seok was faster.

2170
01:24:01,792 --> 01:24:04,191
(Jae Seok is fast.)

2171
01:24:04,191 --> 01:24:05,221
Jae Seok.

2172
01:24:05,221 --> 01:24:06,622
I know the answer.

2173
01:24:07,162 --> 01:24:08,221
I will bet five blades.

2174
01:24:08,221 --> 01:24:09,731
(He bets 5 blades.)

2175
01:24:09,731 --> 01:24:11,231
- I have three blades. - I must win...

2176
01:24:11,231 --> 01:24:13,532
- to take the lead. - That's right.

2177
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:14,702
I am down to two options.

2178
01:24:14,702 --> 01:24:16,802
- It's 1 of the 2. - Show us how to play.

2179
01:24:16,971 --> 01:24:19,802
Show us how to play after years of experience.

2180
01:24:19,802 --> 01:24:21,742
- Let's get it. - Let's get it.

2181
01:24:21,811 --> 01:24:22,842
- Show us. - Say,

2182
01:24:22,842 --> 01:24:24,672
- "Let me do it again." - Let's get it.

2183
01:24:25,082 --> 01:24:26,611
Let's get it.

2184
01:24:26,611 --> 01:24:27,782
(Clicking)

2185
01:24:27,782 --> 01:24:29,912
- That was a good sound. - I thought the pirate would pop up.

2186
01:24:30,151 --> 01:24:33,651
(The careful bet makes them hold their breaths.)

2187
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:35,151
Is the pirate wearing clothes?

2188
01:24:35,151 --> 01:24:37,252
(Out of the blue)

2189
01:24:37,252 --> 01:24:38,391
No,

2190
01:24:38,391 --> 01:24:39,962
he is only wearing the top like Winnie the Pooh.

2191
01:24:39,962 --> 01:24:41,191
(Serious)

2192
01:24:42,061 --> 01:24:43,431
(Jae Seok is on his 5th blade.)

2193
01:24:43,431 --> 01:24:44,632
Did you bet five blades?

2194
01:24:45,032 --> 01:24:47,061
- It's the last one. - It's a 50-50 chance.

2195
01:24:48,032 --> 01:24:49,231
(He bets the blades successfully.)

2196
01:24:49,231 --> 01:24:50,302
He will move up if he gets the answer right.

2197
01:24:50,302 --> 01:24:51,401
Three.

2198
01:24:51,401 --> 01:24:53,242
(He blurts out the answer.)

2199
01:24:53,242 --> 01:24:55,412
Please wait. We need to see if more people will bet.

2200
01:24:56,071 --> 01:24:57,842
- All right. - My goodness.

2201
01:24:58,481 --> 01:25:00,742
- I'll bet. - I will bet six blades.

2202
01:25:00,842 --> 01:25:02,052
Six blades.

2203
01:25:02,382 --> 01:25:03,412
This is driving me crazy.

2204
01:25:03,952 --> 01:25:06,481
- I indeed have a problem. - No, no.

2205
01:25:06,721 --> 01:25:09,052
- Your mouth is the problem. - You are right.

2206
01:25:09,821 --> 01:25:11,521
Kwang Soo, I need a beating.

2207
01:25:12,092 --> 01:25:13,891
- Kwang Soo, I need a beating. - That's right.

2208
01:25:14,122 --> 01:25:16,092
You will get a chance if Haha makes the pirate pop up.

2209
01:25:16,691 --> 01:25:18,731
- Haha, push in the blades. - It should pop up.

2210
01:25:18,731 --> 01:25:20,332
Haha, push in the blades.

2211
01:25:21,901 --> 01:25:23,071
I have one more blade to go.

2212
01:25:23,071 --> 01:25:24,172
(Laughing)

2213
01:25:24,172 --> 01:25:25,901
The pirate should pop up with the last blade.

2214
01:25:25,901 --> 01:25:26,941
(Let's see if Haha succeeds to bet 6 blades.)

2215
01:25:26,941 --> 01:25:27,941
My goodness.

2216
01:25:27,941 --> 01:25:30,712
Jae Seok can win back the right if he bets two more blades.

2217
01:25:30,712 --> 01:25:32,282
You should bet more blades.

2218
01:25:32,282 --> 01:25:33,441
(Jae Seok can win back the right if he bets 2 more blades.)

2219
01:25:33,441 --> 01:25:34,481
You can't give up now.

2220
01:25:34,481 --> 01:25:36,212
- Go ahead. - It's too risky now.

2221
01:25:36,212 --> 01:25:37,511
- Go ahead, and bet two more blades. - Okay. I will bet two more blades.

2222
01:25:37,511 --> 01:25:38,922
- Okay. - All right.

2223
01:25:38,981 --> 01:25:40,622
- Please. - He won't succeed.

2224
01:25:40,651 --> 01:25:42,391
Let's get it.

2225
01:25:42,422 --> 01:25:43,452
Let's get it.

2226
01:25:43,492 --> 01:25:45,422
Let's get it, let's get it

2227
01:25:45,422 --> 01:25:46,721
(He acts in a silly way.)

2228
01:25:47,122 --> 01:25:48,162
Let's get it

2229
01:25:49,132 --> 01:25:50,361
(He succeeds in inserting a blade.)

2230
01:25:50,361 --> 01:25:51,731
- You have 1 more blade to go. - 1 more blade.

2231
01:25:51,731 --> 01:25:53,302
I can't lose when I came this far.

2232
01:25:53,302 --> 01:25:54,401
- I... - Let's go.

2233
01:25:54,401 --> 01:25:55,702
Show us how to play.

2234
01:25:56,231 --> 01:25:57,332
That's it.

2235
01:25:57,332 --> 01:25:58,601
(Jae Seok succeeds in betting 7 blades.)

2236
01:25:58,601 --> 01:26:00,601
- This is insane. - Who will make the pirate pop up?

2237
01:26:01,571 --> 01:26:03,471
- Who will make the pirate pop up? - Seriously.

2238
01:26:03,471 --> 01:26:04,811
Haha, you have 2 more left...

2239
01:26:04,811 --> 01:26:06,582
- to win back the right. - Two more blades.

2240
01:26:06,582 --> 01:26:08,141
This must be what we see on the news.

2241
01:26:09,382 --> 01:26:11,151
I can't lose when I came this far.

2242
01:26:11,151 --> 01:26:13,552
- I will go all in. - Okay.

2243
01:26:13,882 --> 01:26:15,292
All in!

2244
01:26:15,452 --> 01:26:17,021
You only get one shot in life.

2245
01:26:17,021 --> 01:26:19,821
You should have remembered it, Kwang Soo.

2246
01:26:19,891 --> 01:26:22,891
(The Truth of Pirate Oak Barrel starts now.)

2247
01:26:22,891 --> 01:26:24,792
Gambling can ruin your entire family.

2248
01:26:25,261 --> 01:26:26,462
I will insert two blades at once.

2249
01:26:27,361 --> 01:26:29,071
Insert one blade at a time.

2250
01:26:29,071 --> 01:26:30,071
(Spitting)

2251
01:26:30,071 --> 01:26:31,271
Insert two blades at once.

2252
01:26:31,271 --> 01:26:32,542
(He is very serious.)

2253
01:26:32,542 --> 01:26:34,542
(Why is he spitting?)

2254
01:26:34,842 --> 01:26:35,941
My goodness.

2255
01:26:36,342 --> 01:26:37,912
Please make him fail.

2256
01:26:38,542 --> 01:26:40,141
Please make him fail.

2257
01:26:40,481 --> 01:26:42,452
Spray water on it.

2258
01:26:42,452 --> 01:26:44,681
- My mouth is the problem. - Kwang Soo, spray water on it.

2259
01:26:44,681 --> 01:26:46,382
(Jae Seok is facing execution for blurting out the answer.)

2260
01:26:48,181 --> 01:26:49,191
My goodness.

2261
01:26:49,191 --> 01:26:50,891
(His mouth is full of water.)

2262
01:26:50,891 --> 01:26:52,992
(He fails to control the water pressure.)

2263
01:26:53,092 --> 01:26:54,492
Are you out of your mind?

2264
01:26:54,492 --> 01:26:56,332
- Come on. - Come on.

2265
01:26:56,332 --> 01:26:57,592
- Come on. - Come on.

2266
01:26:57,592 --> 01:26:59,202
- I am the double blade of Mapo-gu. - Come on.

2267
01:26:59,202 --> 01:27:02,672
- Come on, you jerk. - Come on. Come on.

2268
01:27:03,372 --> 01:27:04,771
(Inserting)

2269
01:27:04,901 --> 01:27:05,941
(The double blade of Mapo-gu has daring skills.)

2270
01:27:05,941 --> 01:27:07,441
- Insert it here. - That's it.

2271
01:27:09,242 --> 01:27:10,542
That's it.

2272
01:27:10,971 --> 01:27:12,611
Come on. Come on.

2273
01:27:12,611 --> 01:27:15,151
(They continue to bet more blades after one another.)

2274
01:27:15,151 --> 01:27:16,252
Okay.

2275
01:27:18,151 --> 01:27:19,382
That's it.

2276
01:27:19,782 --> 01:27:20,782
I did it.

2277
01:27:20,782 --> 01:27:21,851
(Only five slots remain.)

2278
01:27:21,851 --> 01:27:25,821
(The two of them can't get off the all-in train.)

2279
01:27:25,821 --> 01:27:29,532
(One is on his way to Bora Bora...)

2280
01:27:29,532 --> 01:27:30,861
(while the other is on his way to failure.)

2281
01:27:30,861 --> 01:27:31,962
Haha.

2282
01:27:32,861 --> 01:27:34,162
There he goes.

2283
01:27:34,202 --> 01:27:36,601
(Jae Seok bets 2 more blades.)

2284
01:27:36,601 --> 01:27:37,832
It won't go in.

2285
01:27:38,172 --> 01:27:39,441
Maybe you should've chosen another slot.

2286
01:27:39,502 --> 01:27:41,401
- It's going in. - Push it in with force.

2287
01:27:41,401 --> 01:27:42,441
(They don't know how they came this far.)

2288
01:27:42,611 --> 01:27:44,242
My goodness.

2289
01:27:44,242 --> 01:27:45,311
(He succeeds in inserting a blade.)

2290
01:27:45,611 --> 01:27:47,611
- No way. - The sound was painful.

2291
01:27:47,611 --> 01:27:49,552
- You have one more to go. - His legs went weak.

2292
01:27:49,651 --> 01:27:51,082
You have one more to go.

2293
01:27:51,082 --> 01:27:53,452
Now, 3 out of 4 slots are safe.

2294
01:27:53,452 --> 01:27:54,481
(3 out of 4 slots are safe.)

2295
01:27:56,151 --> 01:27:57,521
- Come on. - Choose that slot.

2296
01:27:57,651 --> 01:27:59,922
My goodness, the pirate talks.

2297
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:04,691
- What does he say? - He nods.

2298
01:28:05,202 --> 01:28:07,032
He is telling me not to choose this slot.

2299
01:28:07,132 --> 01:28:08,361
It's not this one.

2300
01:28:08,471 --> 01:28:10,101
- He says it is. - Is it this one?

2301
01:28:10,372 --> 01:28:11,502
He says it is.

2302
01:28:11,632 --> 01:28:12,802
He nods.

2303
01:28:12,802 --> 01:28:13,971
(He has goosebumps.)

2304
01:28:13,971 --> 01:28:15,511
(Insert it into that slot.)

2305
01:28:15,511 --> 01:28:17,172
- He says it's that one. - This one?

2306
01:28:17,172 --> 01:28:19,412
(Someone is inside the pirate.)

2307
01:28:19,412 --> 01:28:20,742
Will you pop up if I insert the blade here?

2308
01:28:20,742 --> 01:28:22,082
- He is nodding. - He is nodding.

2309
01:28:22,082 --> 01:28:23,552
- No? - No.

2310
01:28:24,052 --> 01:28:26,721
- Are you shaking it? - What are you doing?

2311
01:28:26,922 --> 01:28:28,252
(Trembling)

2312
01:28:28,252 --> 01:28:29,622
What are you doing?

2313
01:28:29,622 --> 01:28:30,992
What is going on?

2314
01:28:30,992 --> 01:28:32,792
- He is a con man. - Whom are you talking to?

2315
01:28:32,792 --> 01:28:34,021
This is a funny skit.

2316
01:28:34,221 --> 01:28:36,561
What are you talking about?

2317
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:38,832
Children love puppet shows.

2318
01:28:38,832 --> 01:28:40,462
- For goodness' sake. - You know,

2319
01:28:40,462 --> 01:28:42,601
- many children were absorbed... - It's neither educational nor fun.

2320
01:28:42,601 --> 01:28:44,172
in the puppet show.

2321
01:28:44,401 --> 01:28:46,101
Everyone was fooled. So Min, you were fooled, right?

2322
01:28:46,101 --> 01:28:47,702
I believed him.

2323
01:28:48,542 --> 01:28:49,771
Let's go!

2324
01:28:52,242 --> 01:28:53,412
(He succeeds.)

2325
01:28:53,412 --> 01:28:54,912
- This is incredible. - Three slots remain.

2326
01:28:55,111 --> 01:28:56,282
Did you insert all the blades?

2327
01:28:56,481 --> 01:28:58,721
- Will Haha be able to do it? - Will you bet more blades?

2328
01:28:58,821 --> 01:29:00,981
- You have to do it. - You have no choice.

2329
01:29:00,981 --> 01:29:02,391
Two more blades don't make a difference now.

2330
01:29:02,391 --> 01:29:05,922
You can turn around now.

2331
01:29:05,922 --> 01:29:09,191
(Haha bets more blades.)

2332
01:29:09,731 --> 01:29:10,891
Right there.

2333
01:29:11,391 --> 01:29:13,632
- This is crazy. - This is crazy, Haha.

2334
01:29:13,632 --> 01:29:16,132
(Jae Seok and Haha put blades in 22 out of 24 slots.)

2335
01:29:16,132 --> 01:29:18,441
- Gosh, it's 1 of the 2. - It's 1 of the 2.

2336
01:29:18,771 --> 01:29:20,441
- We don't know what will happen. - It's a 50-50 chance.

2337
01:29:20,471 --> 01:29:22,271
- Insert the blade. - It's a 50-50 chance.

2338
01:29:22,641 --> 01:29:25,082
Kwang Soo said it's this one, right?

2339
01:29:25,511 --> 01:29:26,611
No, I said it's the one on the left.

2340
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:27,641
- The one on the right. - This one?

2341
01:29:27,641 --> 01:29:30,452
You should trust Kwang Soo this time.

2342
01:29:31,011 --> 01:29:32,351
Trust Kwang Soo.

2343
01:29:32,351 --> 01:29:34,151
(He aims for the slot Kwang Soo recommended.)

2344
01:29:34,382 --> 01:29:37,021
- Trust Kwang Soo. - I am rooting for you.

2345
01:29:37,021 --> 01:29:40,221
(Haha listens to Kwang Soo for the first time.)

2346
01:29:40,221 --> 01:29:43,731
(If he succeeds, he will have the chance to answer.)

2347
01:29:43,731 --> 01:29:46,901
(Is Kwang Soo's hunch wrong today as well?)

2348
01:29:46,901 --> 01:29:49,302
Trust him.

2349
01:29:50,132 --> 01:29:53,542
(23 out of 24 slots are full, but the pirate is still intact.)

2350
01:29:53,842 --> 01:29:56,811
- I think it's broken. - It seems that way.

2351
01:29:56,811 --> 01:29:59,511
We need to insert the blades the right way.

2352
01:29:59,511 --> 01:30:02,611
Maybe you inserted them too forcefully.

2353
01:30:02,851 --> 01:30:04,082
We don't know.

2354
01:30:04,252 --> 01:30:06,452
- Shall we insert the last blade? - The pirate might pop up.

2355
01:30:06,452 --> 01:30:08,521
If the pirate pops up, that means the toy is working.

2356
01:30:08,521 --> 01:30:09,592
Let's insert it.

2357
01:30:09,592 --> 01:30:11,492
- Let's check. - Shall we insert it?

2358
01:30:11,492 --> 01:30:12,962
- Insert it. - Kwang Soo will do it.

2359
01:30:18,292 --> 01:30:22,901
(The last slot was the penalty slot.)

2360
01:30:24,771 --> 01:30:26,372
No way!

2361
01:30:26,542 --> 01:30:28,042
- This is incredible. - I got goosebumps.

2362
01:30:28,101 --> 01:30:30,011
- This is incredible. - It wasn't broken.

2363
01:30:30,011 --> 01:30:32,011
- I thought it was broken. - I got goosebumps.

2364
01:30:33,742 --> 01:30:35,082
You avoided it until the end.

2365
01:30:35,082 --> 01:30:36,351
(Haha gets his chance.)

2366
01:30:36,351 --> 01:30:37,552
What's your answer?

2367
01:30:37,712 --> 01:30:41,481
Three, orange.

2368
01:30:41,481 --> 01:30:43,622
(Haha trusts Jae Seok's slip of the tongue.)

2369
01:30:43,622 --> 01:30:44,891
Three, orange.

2370
01:30:45,592 --> 01:30:49,261
(Is it the right answer?)

2371
01:30:52,202 --> 01:30:55,601
(Haha acquires 12 additional blades.)

2372
01:30:55,601 --> 01:30:57,032
(I can't believe I gave away the answer.)

2373
01:30:57,032 --> 01:30:58,101
Yes!

2374
01:30:58,172 --> 01:30:59,641
Is it really the right answer?

2375
01:30:59,742 --> 01:31:01,071
There is red.

2376
01:31:01,071 --> 01:31:03,212
- That's right. - Let's do a high five.

2377
01:31:03,212 --> 01:31:05,681
- I took out all the blades. - All right.

2378
01:31:05,742 --> 01:31:07,842
Thus, the winner of the day...

2379
01:31:08,511 --> 01:31:09,882
is Haha.

2380
01:31:09,882 --> 01:31:12,481
- He won again. - I did it.

2381
01:31:12,481 --> 01:31:14,122
(Haha wins in 2 weeks in a row.)

2382
01:31:14,452 --> 01:31:18,861
(Haha suggested Bora Bora for the Half and Half Tour.)

2383
01:31:18,861 --> 01:31:24,431
(Who goes to Bora Bora is in his hands.)

2384
01:31:24,861 --> 01:31:26,802
- I will buy 2 of my name tags. - Okay.

2385
01:31:26,901 --> 01:31:29,332
Since Jong Kook wanted to go,

2386
01:31:29,332 --> 01:31:31,132
- I will buy one of his name tag. - All right.

2387
01:31:31,132 --> 01:31:32,571
- Also, - I am okay with that.

2388
01:31:32,771 --> 01:31:35,342
So Min really wanted to go. I will buy one of hers.

2389
01:31:35,342 --> 01:31:36,542
Thank you.

2390
01:31:36,542 --> 01:31:37,842
I will buy these name tags.

2391
01:31:37,842 --> 01:31:40,111
One for Se Chan.

2392
01:31:40,111 --> 01:31:41,952
- Ji Hyo. - That's right.

2393
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:43,011
Why won't you cover my name?

2394
01:31:44,252 --> 01:31:48,552
(The roulette is ready and on standby.)

2395
01:31:48,752 --> 01:31:50,452
I really want to go to Bora Bora.

2396
01:31:50,851 --> 01:31:52,792
Let's go to Bora Bora. When else will we have the chance?

2397
01:31:52,792 --> 01:31:54,221
In 1, 2, 3.

2398
01:31:55,021 --> 01:32:00,361
(The roulette for Bora Bora starts spinning.)

2399
01:32:01,202 --> 01:32:04,172
(It's their chance to enjoy the fantastic island.)

2400
01:32:04,172 --> 01:32:05,542
I want to go.

2401
01:32:05,771 --> 01:32:10,441
(Who is the lucky winner?)

2402
01:32:11,342 --> 01:32:13,011
It will be Jae Seok.

2403
01:32:13,441 --> 01:32:14,842
It will be Haha.

2404
01:32:15,311 --> 01:32:18,651
(Please let it be me.)

2405
01:32:19,651 --> 01:32:24,321
(It's either So Min or Seok Jin.)

2406
01:32:24,321 --> 01:32:27,561
It will be Jae Seok. It will be Haha.

2407
01:32:27,561 --> 01:32:29,662
- It will be So Min. - So Min!

2408
01:32:30,992 --> 01:32:35,231
(So Min is chosen!)

2409
01:32:35,431 --> 01:32:36,771
Good for you!

2410
01:32:36,771 --> 01:32:38,372
She wanted this most desperately.

2411
01:32:38,401 --> 01:32:39,471
- Wasn't that... - She looks so happy.

2412
01:32:39,471 --> 01:32:41,912
- Jae Seok's? - This is amazing.

2413
01:32:41,912 --> 01:32:44,212
- I really want to go there now. - But she didn't do anything today.

2414
01:32:44,212 --> 01:32:46,811
If Bora Bora is chosen as the destination,

2415
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:50,452
So Min and the companion she chooses will go on the trip.

2416
01:32:50,511 --> 01:32:51,611
Thank you!

2417
01:32:51,611 --> 01:32:52,622
(Will she be able to go to Bora Bora?)
